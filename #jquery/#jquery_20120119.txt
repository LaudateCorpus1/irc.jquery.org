[00:01:58] <pringlescan> Hello all, I need to run a regexp on a string that replaces my brain with your brain, can anyone help me? (actually, I need to replace ~ with something, can't get it to work, tried \'ing it)
[00:11:26] <talin_> is there a simple way to check if my jquery library was found, and that it is working?
[00:13:30] <Cork> talin_: typeof(jQuery) !== 'undefined' && jQuery.version !== undefined
[00:14:26] <talin_> Cork: thank you noble sir !
[00:15:15] <talin_> Cork: though, does it miss a '' on the end?
[00:15:15] <donCams> anybody know a plugin to edit inline on static html?
[00:15:17] <talin_> and ;
[00:15:38] <donCams> I need a RTE like tinyMCE or something that supports HTML5
[00:15:56] <Cork> talin_: nope
[00:16:12] <Cork> you don't need to use typeof to check for memebers on an object
[00:16:18] <Cork> but when you check a varaible you do
[00:16:26] <Hooloovoork> donCams: you could check if any of the big editors support html5 elements yet.
[00:16:35] <Cork> talin_: window.jQuery !== undefined && jQuery.version !== undefined would work too
[00:16:56] <talin_> Cork: i tried: if (jQuery) { alert("ha ha ha"); }
[00:16:58] <Hooloovoork> donCams: like tinymce or ckeditor
[00:17:01] <talin_> Cork: and it does say ha ha ha
[00:17:06] <talin_> then why on earth doesn't this work.....
[00:17:13] <donCams> ok
[00:17:19] <Cork> talin_: check jQuery.version
[00:18:28] <mindis|wurk> i doubt any RTE supports HTML5 better than the others since most of them appear to use execCommand
[00:19:05] <donCams> I'm looking at aloha editor
[00:19:08] <anli_> If I have an element inside a div which has a margin-bottom: 5px and the div has a padding of 10px, woudnt that margin be collapsed by the parents padding, if not, why?
[00:19:28] <mindis|wurk> RTE on a webpage is a massive pain. i had to drop IE support because of it :D
[00:20:14] <Hooloovoork> mindis|wurk: yea it should be avoided if possible =P
[00:20:19] <donCams> this is experimental :)
[00:21:04] <Hooloovoork> donCams: you could always write a editor yourself. one that's great with html5!
[00:21:13] <Hooloovoork> oh i'd like to do that sometime.
[00:21:42] <ngharo> ?tell abjorn creepypasta: http://www.angelfire.com/trek/caver/
[00:21:53] <ngharo> son of a b
[00:22:01] <donCams> maybe i should do that this weekend :3
[00:22:08] <ngharo> bot-t you failed me for the last time
[00:22:19] <Hooloovoork> what's it called? that html5 feature that lets you edit stuff directly on a webpage?
[00:22:47] <Hooloovoork> ?botsnack
[00:22:51] <Hooloovoork> =(
[00:23:13] <Hooloovoork> i feel so alone when bot-t isn't here.
[00:23:18] <donCams> contenteditable
[00:23:47] <Hooloovoork> right! use that!
[00:25:10] <Hooloovoork> and a simple drag & drop to add and remove elements
[00:26:33] <donCams> hmmm
[00:26:53] <donCams> actually, Aloha-Editor seems to do what I would want. but I can't find in their documentation how to handle events
[00:27:20] <donCams> like if the user blur, focus on the content he's editing
[00:27:54] <anli_> I have made a div thats an inline block next to a span, how do I vertically center both elements?
[00:28:24] <anli_> Hm, maybe I can superscript the span in some way
[00:28:56] <mindis|wurk> vertical aligning? good luck D:
[00:29:24] <anli_> :)
[00:29:32] <anli_> Maybe I should use a table for it
[00:29:40] <mindis|wurk> you could try adjusting the line height for the parent element, works sometimes for vertical alignments
[00:29:42] <Hooloovoork> anli_: verticaly align to document or to window?
[00:31:05] <Hooloovoork> anli_: you could do something like $("#element-to-align").css({ top: ($(document).height()/2) - ($("#element-to-align").height()/2) });
[00:31:54] <anli_> Oh, only I only want a box and some text to be centered at the same height
[00:32:14] <anli_> oh, maybe thats not the words for it
[00:32:27] <anli_> I want them to not be on the same base line
[00:32:38] <anli_> But to have their centers aligned
[00:32:52] <Hooloovoork> anli_: make a jsfiddle or something and explain what you're trying to do when you have it up.
[00:33:10] <Hooloovoork> but this kinda sorta sounds like a css problem, not a jquery problem.
[00:37:46] <mzilla> so I need an easy way to get the outer html of an element, anyone that can help me?
[00:38:04] <Hooloovoork> bot-t!
[00:38:09] <Hooloovoork> bot-t: i missed you
[00:38:11] <bot-t> Hooloovoork, .hide() - Hide the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/hide/
[00:38:26] <Hooloovoork> bot-t: yes i will hide stuff, but not right now.
[00:38:27] <bot-t> Hooloovoork, .animate() - Perform a custom animation of a set of CSS properties. http://api.jquery.com/animate/
[00:43:37] <jaggz> I can't get my slideToggle() to stop flickering if I move over the trigger div rapidly
[00:44:02] <jaggz> I put stop() in there, but I think I need a delayed close timeout which .. I don't know.
[00:47:34] <similian> how do I best cancel onSubmit="click(this);" ?
[00:47:47] <jaggz> return(false)?
[00:47:50] <similian> this.event.preventDefault()?
[00:48:02] <similian> for some reason it does not really work
[00:48:30] <Hooloovoork> similian: it should. paste m0ar c0ad!
[00:48:45] <similian> okay
[00:48:45] <b0x> $(".content li a").click(function(e) { e.preventDefault(); });
[00:49:06] <b0x> similian ^
[00:49:24] <similian> I call script from onSubmit="" not with $()event
[00:49:51] <b0x> poor form
[00:50:00] <similian> because I would like to have a component that just works in a common way
[00:50:02] <b0x> $('#target').submit(function(e) { e.preventDefault(); });
[00:50:02] <similian> okayx
[00:50:12] <kawohi> hey guys, i need some opinion. What would be a nice effect, after clicking "get more".. http://kdevs.site40.net/#more
[00:50:32] <b0x> #target being the FORM ID
[00:50:40] <b0x> not the id of the submit button
[00:50:46] <b0x> http://api.jquery.com/submit/
[00:50:52] <similian> mh I dont now the ids of my forms in this case
[00:51:01] <similian> i now they have a class inlineEditor
[00:51:01] <b0x> ...
[00:51:07] <b0x> $('form').submit(function(e) { e.preventDefault(); });
[00:51:13] <b0x> whatever, that works ^
[00:51:33] <kawohi> b0x, have any ideas? :)
[00:51:37] <similian> could I select '.inlineEditor form'
[00:51:42] <talin_> hello. when i use tablesorter plugin for jquery, why don't i get that "sort symbol" that the demos have? the symbol you click the looks like two triangles mirrored on top of eachother
[00:51:56] <b0x> kawohi: see .. err.. ANY animation.
[00:52:17] <b0x> like cmon, not really a question.
[00:52:18] <kawohi> i need something nice and smooth....
[00:52:27] <b0x> slideDown
[00:52:35] <b0x> bounce
[00:52:36] <b0x> etc
[00:52:45] <jaggz> my fadeIn() on mouseenter/mouseleave is remembering a maximum opacity .. grr
[00:53:03] <kawohi> something that would fit this.. http://kdevs.site40.net/#more
[00:53:15] <b0x> kawohi: wtf.
[00:53:23] <kawohi> lol
[00:54:23] <kawohi> i tried                 $(".recent-list li").animate({opacity: 0.1} , 800).hide(500); but it only works smoothly the first time
[00:54:35] <b0x> google jquery animations
[00:54:37] <b0x> read
[00:54:38] <b0x> come back
[00:54:44] <b0x> stop expecting to be spoonfed
[00:55:02] <kawohi> ...
[00:55:23] <kawohi> thanks for being so helpful
[00:55:35] <b0x> talin_: have u checked with firebug or something to see if the images should be there, but have got the incorrect path or something?
[00:55:41] <b0x> kawohi: np.
[00:56:29] <b0x> kawohi: http://slodive.com/freebies/jquery-animate/
[00:56:38] <b0x> 55 jquery animate resources
[00:56:42] <b0x> a short google away
[00:57:19] <talin_> b0x: are those images ? hmm
[00:57:46] <b0x> iirc yes the sort order icons are images
[00:58:36] <talin_> b0x: weird. when i look at the source for a page that has them (demo at tablesorter.com), i can't see any images defined. maybe there's some css stuff
[00:58:43] <anli_> I have a h3 with an onclick, however, I need to click twice to trigger the handler and then the handler happends twice
[00:59:20] <talin_> b0x: hmm, it does have an example with an image, it seems.
[00:59:48] <anli_> Seems like onmousedown did what I wanted however
[00:59:51] <b0x> table.tablesorter thead tr .header { background-image: url("bg.gif"); background-position: right center; background-repeat: no-repeat; cursor: pointer; }
[00:59:56] <b0x> pretty sure thats an image
[01:00:12] <b0x> css ;)
[01:00:54] <jaggz> thanks.. I've been googling and avoiding asking for a long time
[01:01:05] <b0x> ?
[01:01:47] <mindis|wurk> http://www.adityaravishankar.com/projects/games/command-and-conquer/ lol
[01:01:55] <mindis|wurk> the things people try
[01:02:54] <b0x> wtf
[01:03:22] <Hooloovoork> mindis|wurk: that's awesoem
[01:03:35] <b0x> loading...
[01:04:32] <b0x> omg
[01:04:39] <b0x> this works alot better than i was expecting
[01:31:09] <kawohi> fml
[01:31:39] <Ortund> still having trouble?
[01:31:53] <kawohi> well, i fixed that problem we was having.
[01:32:33] <kawohi> Now, I need to figure out how to get this damn "like" button to show up once they click get more quotes......
[01:33:00] <kawohi> http://kdevs.site40.net/
[01:33:27] <kawohi> fml..
[01:33:52] <kawohi> the problem is this...
[01:36:09] <kawohi> http://pastie.org/private/irz7vldki1arswojyld6a
[01:40:41] <LukeNukem> anybody know a plugin which helps us to choose a part of the image
[01:40:42] <LukeNukem> from a big image
[01:40:50] <LukeNukem> but limits how much it can be extended
[01:43:25] <kawohi> only if i didnt spent all day crying over my ex.... id get this finished...
[01:49:32] <LukeNukem> kawohi, wtf man
[01:49:52] <Hooloovoork> lol
[01:49:58] <LukeNukem> people have hearts these days? o.o
[01:50:32] <Hooloovoork> LukeNukem: it's just a trick to get help!
[01:50:37] <Hooloovoork> you might even say...
[01:50:37] <r1pp3rj4ck> hey guys
[01:50:40] <Hooloovoork> it's a trap!
[01:50:45] <LukeNukem> kawohi, bitch!...
[01:50:45] <LukeNukem> :D
[01:51:01] <LukeNukem> since nobody has a heart, im guessing it wont work =D
[01:51:52] <kawohi> im not a man :/
[01:51:54] <r1pp3rj4ck> i have a form which i want to submit on change of any input
[01:52:04] <Hooloovoork> o...m...g
[01:52:08] <r1pp3rj4ck> that works with onChange="this.form.submit()"
[01:52:12] <Hooloovoork> another trap!
[01:52:28] <r1pp3rj4ck> but i want to prevent submitting some inputs
[01:53:22] <Hooloovoork> r1pp3rj4ck: well, do something like $("form:not(.nosubmit)").bind("change",function(){ submit here! })
[01:53:25] <r1pp3rj4ck> i'm trying to debug it, so i added this line $(this).find('.decade .year .month .day').value('10');
[01:53:34] <Hooloovoork> and add .nosubmit to the ones you don't wanna submit
[01:53:37] <r1pp3rj4ck> and it doesn't run either :S
[01:54:06] <kawohi> and LukeNukem i only wish it was a trick... damn i hate being heart broken
[01:54:13] <r1pp3rj4ck> Hooloovoork: it has to be dynamical, so the js logic has to decide which to submit and which not
[01:54:18] <LukeNukem> kawohi, 5th of vodka and your set
[01:54:45] <kawohi> feels like 6 years of my life is wasted with her :/
[01:54:53] <Hooloovoork> r1pp3rj4ck: that sucks. does the inputs you don't wanna submit have a class or something you can identify them by?
[01:55:02] <r1pp3rj4ck> sure they have id-s
[01:55:15] <r1pp3rj4ck> i pasted that line
[01:55:24] <r1pp3rj4ck> those are the id-s + century
[01:55:24] <Hooloovoork> kawohi: feels like last 15 years of mine was, and i didn't even have a gf that time!
[01:56:14] <Hooloovoork> r1pp3rj4ck: then just do $("input:not(#1):not(#2)").bind("change", function() {})
[01:57:09] <kawohi> Hooloovoork: you wanna hear something crazy? I'm spending this time trying to hack her computer with a RAT. :(
[01:57:37] <Hooloovoork> kawohi: that's stupid. i've decided i don't like you.
[01:57:51] <Hooloovoork> also i have no idea what a rat is. except the furry kind.
[01:57:56] <r1pp3rj4ck> Hooloovoork: i guess you misunderstood me
[01:58:16] <kawohi> i don't like myself ether :*(
[01:58:16] <Hooloovoork> r1pp3rj4ck: yup. do a jsfiddle and it'll be done in no time.
[01:58:29] <r1pp3rj4ck> but i'm not sure, i'm back-end developer, our client-side dev is at home
[01:58:43] <Hooloovoork> ?jsfiddle @ r1pp3rj4ck
[01:58:44] <bot-t> r1pp3rj4ck, jsFiddle (http://jsfiddle.net) is an online IDE for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is the best way to provide test cases of your jQuery bugs (for support and the bug tracker). Make sure to include the jQuery library (on the left side) and any relevant markup or CSS. You can include external dependencies via the Add Resources tab. You can also mock AJAX requests.
[01:59:18] <Hooloovoork> r1pp3rj4ck: be both! it's so much more awesome if you can actually do all parts of cool things.
[01:59:27] <r1pp3rj4ck> so i have 5 inputs: century, decade, year, month and day
[01:59:49] <r1pp3rj4ck> Hooloovoork: i know, but i guess i won't stick to web development for too long
[01:59:57] <r1pp3rj4ck> i want to try Java
[02:00:06] <r1pp3rj4ck> i'm doing web for like 10 years now
[02:00:09] <Hooloovoork> r1pp3rj4ck: yea great idea. start with a dying language.
[02:00:20] <r1pp3rj4ck> why is java a dying language?
[02:00:26] <Hooloovoork> r1pp3rj4ck: cause oracle owns it
[02:00:50] <r1pp3rj4ck> yup and mark hurd is the new CEO
[02:01:09] <r1pp3rj4ck> i'm not sure where that's going now
[02:01:28] <Hooloovoork> r1pp3rj4ck: python or scala or something is prolly a safer bet if you want a job in a few years.
[02:01:56] <r1pp3rj4ck> i'm not sure what i want to do in a few years
[02:02:17] <Hooloovoork> r1pp3rj4ck: might as well spend the time it takes to decide learing a fun new language then! =D
[02:02:27] <r1pp3rj4ck> but i'm sure java is great at least to broaden my horizon
[02:02:31] <kawohi> after watching Notch code his games live with java... would love to learn that.
[02:02:58] <Hooloovoork> kawohi: any other language will be just as fine.
[02:03:19] <r1pp3rj4ck> anyway... if the user clicks on any selects and change it, it has to submit the form
[02:03:40] <r1pp3rj4ck> but if i select a century, only the century should be submitted
[02:03:56] <r1pp3rj4ck> if i select a decade, century and decade should be submitted
[02:03:57] <r1pp3rj4ck> etc
[02:04:11] <Hooloovoork> r1pp3rj4ck: you're submitting this how?
[02:04:22] <Hooloovoork> a regular form submit or is it ajax?
[02:05:02] <mathi> hi
[02:05:07] <r1pp3rj4ck> regular form submit
[02:05:09] <r1pp3rj4ck> but no button
[02:05:23] <Hooloovoork> r1pp3rj4ck: you can't submit parts of a form
[02:05:37] <mathi> how can I exclude an element in a selector? for example all elements that match $('.entry') except self
[02:05:46] <mathi> (self is a variable containing a jquery element)
[02:05:54] <Hooloovoork> mathi: :not
[02:06:04] <Hooloovoork> mathi: like $("#ele:not(.stupidclass)")
[02:06:05] <r1pp3rj4ck> there's no way to submit parts of a form? :O
[02:06:36] <Hooloovoork> r1pp3rj4ck: not that i know of. you could handle the submit server side though and sort everything out there.
[02:06:37] <mathi> mmm I have a variable to exclude
[02:06:54] <mathi> a jquery element
[02:07:05] <Hooloovoork> mathi: hmmm.... maybe $(".test").not(var)
[02:07:11] <r1pp3rj4ck> Hooloovoork: i have to submit it via GET and it would look really lame
[02:07:24] <Hooloovoork> mathi: but i have no clue if that works
[02:07:50] <mindis|wurk> can you always get accurate results in pixels if something had a css rule where the definition was percentages or ems? like width: 50em;
[02:07:52] <Hooloovoork> r1pp3rj4ck: make it ajaxy instead, that's cooler
[02:08:11] <Hooloovoork> mindis|wurk: i think it's pretty darn accurate
[02:08:21] <mathi> doesn't seem to work
[02:08:42] <r1pp3rj4ck> Hooloovoork: it's not really good for SEO
[02:08:50] <r1pp3rj4ck> :S
[02:09:02] <Hooloovoork> r1pp3rj4ck: seo is for losers. awesome is for winners!
[02:09:11] <r1pp3rj4ck> lol
[02:09:19] <Hooloovoork> also it doesn't matter on something like a form submit
[02:09:59] <Hooloovoork> loading content with ajax is really bad for seo though
[02:10:02] <r1pp3rj4ck> Hooloovoork: but that form submit decides what events to list below
[02:10:16] <mathi> o sorry i id a wrong test
[02:10:20] <mathi> *did
[02:10:33] <XMan2012> i have a input field  for coupon and each coupon starts with "LT" character ... how can i setup a validation in jquery validation for it...
[02:10:37] <XMan2012> thanks in advance
[02:11:06] <Hooloovoork> XMan2012: check out substr() function in javascript
[02:11:30] <XMan2012> i want to check if coupon has "LT" at the beginning then allows user to move ahead otherwise not...
[02:11:43] <Hooloovoork> r1pp3rj4ck: well, like i said i think this is more of a backend problem if you really wanna use form submits.
[02:12:00] <Hooloovoork> r1pp3rj4ck: frontend it's just change, submit, change, submit etc
[02:15:48] <mathi> how can I check the tagname of a jquery elemnt?
[02:16:20] <mindis|wurk> yourjquerything.get().tagName
[02:16:33] <mindis|wurk> oops. yourjquerything.get(0).tagName
[02:20:06] <r1pp3rj4ck> Hooloovoork: ok, i handled it on server side
[02:20:23] <Hooloovoork> r1pp3rj4ck: sweet
[02:20:45] <r1pp3rj4ck> but still, there is this $('.timelineControl').submit(function() { alert('asdfadf'); }
[02:20:57] <r1pp3rj4ck> and when i change anything, it won't alert this
[02:21:44] <r1pp3rj4ck> <form class="timeLineControl" id="timeLineControl" action="{{ url('timeline') }}">
[02:21:47] <r1pp3rj4ck> this is the form
[02:22:07] <r1pp3rj4ck> and this is on every select onChange="this.form.submit()"
[02:22:11] <Hooloovoork> r1pp3rj4ck: i bet
[02:22:47] <Hooloovoork> r1pp3rj4ck: try something like this $("input").bind("change", function() { $("form").submit(); })
[02:23:06] <mathi> Hooloovoork, .net(self) is working
[02:23:09] <mathi> *.not
[02:23:15] <Hooloovoork> mathi: awesomeness
[02:29:34] <r1pp3rj4ck> Hooloovoork: http://pastebin.com/yJDkeMgz this is the new code
[02:29:47] <r1pp3rj4ck> but nothing happens when i change anything
[02:30:33] <Hooloovoork> {% else %}
[02:30:35] <Hooloovoork> the hell is that?
[02:30:45] <r1pp3rj4ck> twig
[02:30:56] <r1pp3rj4ck> template engine
[02:31:01] <Hooloovoork> ugh
[02:31:11] <r1pp3rj4ck> what?
[02:31:21] <Hooloovoork> using template engines to template code is just... wrong
[02:31:30] <Hooloovoork> i'd feel sooooo dirty
[02:32:00] <r1pp3rj4ck> why?
[02:33:04] <Hooloovoork> r1pp3rj4ck: it's like using a cart to move a bike =P
[02:33:33] <r1pp3rj4ck> lol
[02:33:56] <r1pp3rj4ck> i love separating php and html
[02:34:10] <r1pp3rj4ck> i would feel dirty otherwise
[02:34:20] <Hooloovoork> me too, that's why most things i write is with a ajax api =P
[02:34:26] <r1pp3rj4ck> :D
[02:34:30] <Hooloovoork> that way i can keep them reeeeaaaally separate
[02:34:47] <r1pp3rj4ck> anyway... why is this not working?
[02:35:07] <Hooloovoork> dunno, i've never submitted a form using javascript in my life
[02:35:26] <r1pp3rj4ck> i see
[02:35:42] <Hooloovoork> make a jsfiddle with testdata and i can try making it work myself
[02:35:58] <r1pp3rj4ck> sec
[02:36:30] <scratcha> Hooloovoork: you've never lived!@
[02:36:38] <r1pp3rj4ck> hmm it's not the submit part
[02:36:43] <Hooloovoork> scratcha: lol! i guess not =D
[02:37:05] <r1pp3rj4ck> $('#timelineControlSelect').bind("change", function() { alert('asdfa'); }); this doesn't work either
[02:37:13] <mzilla> hmm got a question here, I am creating a draggable / droppable thing here and I only want one dropzone active at the sametime (the dropzones are nested). I have greedy set to true but still it sometimes happens that multiple nested dropzones get activated. Am I missing something?
[02:37:44] <Hooloovoork> r1pp3rj4ck: what do you want to actually happen on the site when you change $("#timelineControlSelect")?
[02:38:04] <harpal> Which plugin I should use to get event calendar
[02:38:22] <r1pp3rj4ck> change values of some selects to ''
[02:38:27] <Hooloovoork> mzilla: i think you should write your own droppable. jquery ui one is bugged when you do too complicated stuff.
[02:38:43] <Hooloovoork> r1pp3rj4ck: not submit anything?
[02:38:45] <mzilla> Hooloovoork: thanks, I was affraid of that
[02:39:05] <r1pp3rj4ck> i want to submit the form, but change some values to ''
[02:39:18] <r1pp3rj4ck> have you checked the pastebin i linked?
[02:39:53] <Hooloovoork> r1pp3rj4ck: okies, then do this. $("#selectbox").bind("change", function() { $("selectorsforinputs").val(""); $("form").submit(); })
[02:39:56] <Hooloovoork> or something like that
[02:40:12] <Hooloovoork> r1pp3rj4ck: yup
[02:40:22] <Hooloovoork> r1pp3rj4ck: all the templating makes it look like nonsense to me. =P
[02:40:38] <r1pp3rj4ck> :D
[02:40:38] <mzilla> I just need to find a way to limit the number of dropzones ... maybe on a dropabble over event or something like that
[02:40:55] <Hooloovoork> mzilla: check the documentation
[02:41:07] <mzilla> Hooloovoork: will do!
[02:41:12] <Hooloovoork> mzilla: not sure it can do that though. been a while since i used jquery ui
[02:41:33] <mzilla> hmm I might just hack in to it on the over-event or something like that
[02:41:57] <r1pp3rj4ck> Hooloovoork: i just did this: http://pastebin.com/Wi9TAnYT
[02:41:59] <Hooloovoork> mzilla: might work =)
[02:42:04] <r1pp3rj4ck> and *nothing* happened
[02:42:29] <Hooloovoork> isn't THAT that weird!
[02:42:31] <mzilla> Hooloovoork: hope so, it would be cool if I could cancel the hover or right there ... let's try
[02:43:26] <Hooloovoork> r1pp3rj4ck: nd the element is a select element?
[02:43:59] <r1pp3rj4ck> <select name="century" class="timelineControlSelect" id="century">
[02:44:04] <r1pp3rj4ck> there are five of these
[02:44:10] <r1pp3rj4ck> century, decade, year, month, day
[02:44:16] <Hooloovoork> hehehe
[02:44:16] <r1pp3rj4ck> all of them have this class
[02:44:20] <Hooloovoork> i know what's wrong
[02:44:23] <r1pp3rj4ck> what?
[02:44:39] <Hooloovoork> you're trying to bind it to the ID timelineControlSelect
[02:44:52] <Hooloovoork> $(".timelineControlSelect").bind("change", function() {
[02:45:07] <r1pp3rj4ck> damn...
[02:45:07] <r1pp3rj4ck> :D
[02:45:10] <r1pp3rj4ck> thanks :D
[02:45:11] <mzilla> I make that mistake all the time
[02:46:09] <Hooloovoork> after a loong time of jquery and css code i've learned to check that before everything else when stuff won't work =P
[02:46:51] <r1pp3rj4ck> :D
[02:47:32] <mzilla> always start debugging at the top :)
[02:47:52] <mzilla> I always start with console.log($('#myseletor')) to see if that returns anything at all
[02:48:29] <Hooloovoork> yea that's a good way of debugging stuff that should happen but doesn't.
[02:56:44] <r1pp3rj4ck> Hooloovoork: actually, i managed to submit parts of the form
[02:56:48] <r1pp3rj4ck> $('#day').attr('disabled', 'disabled');
[02:56:51] <r1pp3rj4ck> like this
[02:58:06] <Hooloovoork> r1pp3rj4ck: oh yea! that might actually work
[02:58:22] <Hooloovoork> good idea!
[02:58:29] <Hooloovoork> still stupid to use forms though =P
[02:58:50] <r1pp3rj4ck> :D
[02:58:56] <similian> can I let a div have its own function like $("div .editor").fooIt()
[02:59:05] <r1pp3rj4ck> thanks for the help, Hooloovoork
[02:59:10] <Hooloovoork> similian: yup
[02:59:14] <r1pp3rj4ck> brb smoke && lunch
[02:59:36] <Hooloovoork> similian: i think so at least. it's not  good way to do it, but why not.
[02:59:51] <similian> well I would like to create an editor component
[03:00:12] <Hooloovoork> similian: try something like var test = $("el"); test.foo = function() {//code}
[03:00:29] <Hooloovoork> similian: you could do it as a plugin...
[03:01:02] <similian> lets say have a div <div class="editor"></div> and rewrite this part to a static text vs ajax json form
[03:01:18] <similian> alsmost like editable plugin
[03:01:24] <similian> but with an edit button
[03:01:51] <kawohi> going to cry over my ex some more. goodnight guys
[03:01:57] <Hooloovoork> kawohi: night
[03:02:40] <similian> any ideas ?
[03:03:02] <similian> I would not like to wirte an inline editor for each item i have
[03:03:08] <similian> i rather have it more flexible
[03:03:11] <Hooloovoork> my brain is all empty now cause i'm gonna go have lunch.
[03:03:24] <similian> okay, have a good one then
[03:03:26] <similian> :D
[03:03:42] <Hooloovoork> sure will. good luck!
[03:16:58] <similian> does the id selector work if i have an . in my id?
[03:18:59] <similian> can i autoescape a string
[03:20:41] <blinkdesign> http://xkr.us/articles/javascript/encode-compare/
[03:22:40] <sale666> hello
[03:23:06] <sale666> is any1 here?
[03:23:41] <similian> that doesn escape . to \\.
[03:29:45] <shesek_> similian, should I really say that the obvious solution is... don't use '.'s in your IDs?
[03:30:05] <shesek_> Its not a valid characters in IDs, even tho it might work in some cases and be able to work-around in others
[03:30:15] <shesek_> * character
[03:39:17] <Aha2Y>  Can someone tell me why this twitter script doesn't work.  http://176.31.241.189/js/tweet/jquery.tweet.js @the bottom of the homepage
[03:39:35] <Aha2Y> its supposed to receive tweets from: https://twitter.com/#!/anonprojects
[03:39:37] <socialhapy> ★ Tweet from AnonProjects: Third tweet. ★ http://bit.ly/A0widL
[03:41:10] <Andres75> yo people anyone willing to help me out on a small plugin I'm developing?
[03:41:40] <_johnny> that's a whole lot of commitment before hearing anything about it :)
[03:41:50] <Aha2Y> anyone? :|
[03:41:53] <_johnny> what's the issue, Andres75 ?
[03:42:35] <Andres75> I'm having an issue iterating through this.each
[03:42:37] <Andres75> http://www.psfinteractive.it/bigoom/jqt2.html
[03:42:53] <_johnny> Aha2Y: bottom of http://176.31.241.189/ ? seems to have tweets here (chrome)
[03:43:10] <error4o4> in the Ajax complete function, how can I get one of the parameters sent thorugh the ajax request
[03:43:12] <Andres75> if you inspect given page in firebug you'll see that both images are generated and placed incorrectly in the second div
[03:43:47] <Andres75> sorry the correct page is http://www.psfinteractive.it/bigoom/jqt.html
[03:43:55] <_johnny> Andres75: and where are you iterating?
[03:44:01] <_johnny> ah ;)
[03:44:16] <_johnny> still no .each()
[03:44:49] <xec> Andres75: your plugin is the iCompose i take it?
[03:44:54] <Andres75> yup
[03:45:12] <Andres75> I can't post code but the iteration is there
[03:45:17] <xec> it's 370 lines... what am i looking at
[03:45:36] <xec> 337?
[03:45:38] <Andres75> 338
[03:45:39] <_johnny> Andres75: try $(this).each() - are you sure you have a jquery wrapped this?
[03:45:40] <Andres75> yes
[03:45:55] <Andres75> that's what it said in the tutorial
[03:45:57] <Andres75> ;)§
[03:46:19] <xec> _johnny: yes, plugins get a jquery collection as this, no need to wrap
[03:46:19] <_johnny> well, your this in myElement is the function
[03:46:45] <_johnny> try passing your (now ambigious) this in 337
[03:47:02] <_johnny> var test = this;
[03:47:10] <_johnny> return this.each(function(test) { console.log(test); ...
[03:48:21] <Andres75> sec
[03:48:40] <Aha2Y> anyone? :|
[03:48:50] <xec> Andres75: you're trying to get the ID, but the div's don't have an ID
[03:48:51] <joris> Hi. How do I fire an event when every img in a certain div, is loaded?
[03:49:04] <joris> $('#container').load(function(){}); doesn't do it
[03:49:09] <Andres75> yes... just a second... someone modified my code in the night
[03:49:16] <Andres75> I'll set it back up
[03:49:17] <_johnny> Aha2Y: can you elaborate? there are plenty of tweets at the bottom of your page from where i see it
[03:49:55] <mzilla> joris: you can try .ready() or use #container img as selector
[03:50:18] <joris> #container img will fire a load event for each img
[03:50:24] <joris> but thanks I'll try ready()
[03:50:29] <Aha2Y> _johnny, i mentioned in the js script account: 'anonprojects'
[03:50:33] <Aha2Y> but it won't work
[03:50:34] <mzilla> joris: stupid me you are right
[03:50:42] <xec> mzilla: will ready() wait for images?
[03:50:51] <joris> I don't think it will
[03:51:12] <Andres75> ok original code is back up sorry for the delay
[03:51:15] <mzilla> my test says no
[03:51:21] <joris> I suspect I'll have to load() each image and count them up
[03:51:34] <mzilla> maybe take a look at this plugin https://github.com/alexanderdickson/waitForImages
[03:51:36] <xec> Andres75: same url?
[03:51:38] <joris> thanks
[03:51:44] <Andres75> yes
[03:51:54] <joris> perfect, ty
[03:51:58] <larsemil> xec: $(window).load() waits for images
[03:52:06] <Andres75> thanks everyone, this has been baffling me for days
[03:52:09] <xec> larsemil: that's what I thought
[03:52:12] <mzilla> larsemil: yes but not inside a speific div
[03:52:12] <joris> Yeah, now I need something else instead of window
[03:53:21] <Andres75> problem doesnt seem to be the images... just how I append the object
[03:53:36] <Andres75> according to the tutorial though my method is correct
[03:54:29] <xec> Andres75: i don't have time to look through all that code, could you make a test case demonstrating the issue?
[03:54:39] <xec> with as little code as possible
[03:55:36] <xec> preferably with an explanation of what it is intended to do, and what happens instead
[03:55:57] <Andres75> ok as soon as I can put it up I will
[03:56:03] <Andres75> will you be on later?
[03:57:42] <xec> i'll be here a couple hours, but if you make a good test case it's likely that someone else can help too ;)
[04:00:32] <Andres75> sure.. i'll post in the chatbox as soon as it's done
[04:03:37] <Aha2Y> ..
[04:10:56] <palanivel> i have 1 clarification slidedown concept s possible in html table
[04:11:32] <Hooloovoork> palanivel: not really, no
[04:11:34] <Hooloovoork> but yes
[04:11:37] <Hooloovoork> but it's tricky
[04:11:46] <Hooloovoork> slide a div in the table cell
[04:11:53] <palanivel> plzzzzz give a suggestion
[04:12:17] <Hooloovoork> i did
[04:13:22] <palanivel> that div also 1 row in table
[04:14:39] <palanivel> 	that div also 1 row in table???? r how u using???????/
[04:15:01] <palanivel> can u send sample program??????????/
[04:15:15] <palanivel> else refere some tutorial
[04:16:52] <palanivel> @Hooloovoork: Ar u there??????
[04:17:27] <xec> palanivel: maybe he will answer if you put more questionmarks
[04:18:33] <palanivel> @xec : mmmmmmmmmm
[04:19:09] <palanivel> @xec : u know ???
[04:19:14] <xec> palanivel: if you know how many columns you have, you could insert something like <tr><td colspan="N"></td></tr>
[04:19:24] <xec> palanivel: and then change the height of that td
[04:19:56] <xec> but - your question is very vague
[04:21:50] <palanivel> @xec : ill try
[04:24:55] <palanivel> my question s when am click Add more details button that time slidedown concept want to perform in table and dynamic too ??
[04:25:55] <xec> that doesn't sound like a question to me
[04:26:12] <xec> ?demo @ palanivel
[04:26:12] <bot-t> palanivel, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[04:31:05] <nFFF> IS this too far fetched: each().
[04:31:18] <nFFF> jQuery('.select').each().attr('name').val().replaceWith('super_attribute';
[04:32:51] <snagnever> nfff im not sure, but why are you using each there?
[04:34:14] <nFFF> jQuery('select').each(function(){ $(this).attr('name').val().replaceWith('super_attribute'); });
[04:34:31] <nFFF> <select  name="options[272]" >
[04:34:45] <nFFF> want it iterate over select's and change options to super_attribute
[04:35:00] <palanivel_> @xec and @ bot-t : http://jsfiddle.net/n9pkj/1/
[04:35:52] <xec> ?botsnack
[04:35:53] <bot-t> Thank you! OMNOMNOMNOMNOM
[04:36:06] <snagnever> nfff i think you have to remove the attr and then add your new one, 'replaceWith' is only for replacing elements
[04:36:18] <Hooloovoork> i'm gonna try something!
[04:36:24] <Hooloovoork> ?jsfiddle @ bot-t
[04:36:25] <bot-t> bot-t, jsFiddle (http://jsfiddle.net) is an online IDE for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is the best way to provide test cases of your jQuery bugs (for support and the bug tracker). Make sure to include the jQuery library (on the left side) and any relevant markup or CSS. You can include external dependencies via the Add Resources tab. You can also mock AJAX requests.
[04:36:29] <Hooloovoork> eehehehe
[04:36:56] <xec> palanivel: you will not be able to use the .slideDown() as easily with tables
[04:37:28] <palanivel> may i know the reason plzzzz
[04:38:12] <Hooloovoork> palanivel: i told you how to do it. it's not rocket science. it's <td><div class="poo"></div></td>
[04:38:20] <Hooloovoork> and then $(".poo").slideDown();
[04:39:45] <Hooloovoork> tables expand very well vertically, but only if a child element is pushing it.
[04:39:50] <nFFF> http://jsfiddle.net/T5MH4/ anyone knwo why its not repacing attirbute
[04:40:52] <palanivel> @hooloovoork : thankzzzzzz yaar i ill try and get back to u............
[04:42:23] <nFFF> jQuery('select').each(function() { $(this).removeAttr('name'); $(this).attr('name','super_attribute'); });
[04:42:23] <Hooloovoork> i prolly won't answer tho since i'm at work. i just stop by time from time...
[04:42:28] <nFFF> whys that not working
[04:42:48] <xec> nFFF: http://jsfiddle.net/T5MH4/1/
[04:43:34] <xec> nFFF: sorry http://jsfiddle.net/T5MH4/2/
[04:43:39] <Hooloovoork> nFFF: or you could run it on document ready and it would prolly work...
[04:43:54] <nFFF> Thanks xec
[04:43:55] <nFFF> as always
[04:44:14] <_ramo> hi
[04:44:15] <nFFF> How would I replace 'options' only
[04:44:23] <nFFF> and not the [273]
[04:44:30] <nFFF> using regex I guess?
[04:44:34] <_ramo> is there a solution for refreshing ajax calls when hitting the back button of the browser and using .load() ?
[04:44:45] <xec> nFFF: regex is my first bet too
[04:45:06] <Hooloovoork> nFFF: or just substr
[04:45:17] <Hooloovoork> nFFF: if you know it's gonna be a 3 digit number
[04:45:40] <Hooloovoork> _ramo: you can push history to browser
[04:45:54] <Hooloovoork> _ramo: google it, i haven't tried it out cause it's so new.
[04:46:20] <Hooloovoork> bye _ramo o/
[04:46:59] <xec> _ramo: take a look at http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-bbq-plugin/
[04:49:36] <xec> nFFF: http://jsfiddle.net/T5MH4/3/ ugly! but works :D
[04:51:25] <xec> nFFF: http://jsfiddle.net/T5MH4/4/
[04:51:36] <nFFF> Thanks
[04:51:41] <nFFF> Works thats all that matters
[04:51:46] <xec> dunno how cross browser that last one is
[04:51:48] <nFFF> Was looking into regex but mine suck
[04:55:57] <kzar> I want my function to be called as text is changed in a textarea, the change event doesn't seem to trigger until after the textarea is de-selected which isn't what I want. Any suggestions?
[04:57:00] <mzilla> okay, so I am having this problem where I am sure i am overlooking somehting but I can
[04:57:04] <mzilla> 't seem to find what
[04:57:18] <Hooloovoork> kzar: bind it to keydown event in textbox
[04:57:32] <mzilla> I have an <ul> containging <li>'s which agian contain's <ul>'s with <li>'s
[04:57:35] <Hooloovoork> or possibly keyup
[04:57:40] <xec> or keyup if you want the last character entered
[04:57:54] <Hooloovoork> yupyup
[04:57:54] <mzilla> I want to bind an onclick to all li's but the parent li is always picking up the event
[04:58:18] <Hooloovoork> mzilla: just bind it to the child li's then
[04:58:35] <xec> mzilla: event.stopPropagation()
[04:58:48] <mzilla> okay, I forgot to say, I don't know how deep the list will be, It is a recursive structure
[04:58:50] <xec> should stop bubbling to the parent
[04:59:04] <kzar> OK thanks guys
[04:59:37] <mzilla> so instead of $('ul li').click(function(e){ I do $('ul li').each and bind the click
[04:59:54] <xec> mzilla: did you try the stopPropagation?
[05:00:22] <mzilla> yeah I did i have : $('ul li').click(function(e){ /* do stuff*/; e.stopPropagation(); });
[05:00:29] <kurtis> Hey guys, do you have any ideas why this isn't working? http://pastebin.com/W3yTckJt
[05:00:59] <xec> mzilla: that should work, could you make a demo? see ?demo
[05:00:59] <bot-t> mzilla, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[05:01:07] <mzilla> okay!
[05:01:10] <mzilla> will do
[05:02:39] <kurtis> Demo for my problem: http://knoesis.org/research# -- First link on left side.
[05:02:47] <kurtis> (Should be opening in a new window)
[05:02:50] <Hooloovoork> kurtis: i think you have to remove the " " from the link in the selector
[05:03:17] <kurtis> Hooloovoork: That's how I originally had it, but I'll try it again just in case
[05:03:39] <Hooloovoork> try just console.log() that element and see if that shows anything
[05:03:51] <kurtis> Good idea
[05:05:31] <xec> kurtis: put your script after jquery lib
[05:06:06] <kurtis> xec: It is -- unless I'm missing something?
[05:06:31] <xec> sorry i'm confusing myself
[05:07:13] <xec> kurtis: but i am getting error in console: $ is not a function
[05:07:33] <kurtis> haha, just saw that myself. I'll see if maybe Drupal is including Jquery as another variable
[05:07:34] <xec> krucial: referring to line 81 of research, which is: $(document).ready(function() {
[05:08:51] <kurtis> Yeah -- looksl ike its calling the normal $ object "jQuery"
[05:08:52] <kurtis> Thanks!
[05:10:29] <kurtis> xec, Hooloovoork: Got it working. Thanks a lot! I would've been banging my head over that for a while.
[05:12:43] <Guest12520> .
[05:12:50] <Andres75> hey xec here's the shortened version
[05:12:52] <Andres75> http://www.psfinteractive.it/bigoom/jqt-short.html
[05:13:01] <Andres75> same problem
[05:14:46] <tomasm-> hi, does jquery in a post/get tell the server what the name of the container is that it's updating? I have the same function handle various containers and depending on which it is (ie 'modal' vs 'EventLocation') i want to react differently in my PHP
[05:15:30] <Hooloovoork> tomasm-: you have to tell it
[05:16:19] <tomasm-> i mean load(), does load() tell it automatically, and if not, how do I? I have a quite a bit of code, i need it done transparently
[05:16:24] <Hooloovoork> no
[05:16:49] <Hooloovoork> i haven't checked, but i can promise you that it don't
[05:16:51] <xec> Andres75: line 25 in jqt-short.html - looks like an extra trailing comma
[05:16:55] <Hooloovoork> it would be crazy if it did
[05:17:02] <Hooloovoork> also, don't use load()
[05:17:04] <xec> Andres75: but what exactly is the issue?
[05:17:05] <tomasm-> Hooloovoork, I know that prototype does
[05:17:09] <Hooloovoork> it's a shame the function exists at all
[05:17:29] <tomasm-> Hooloovoork, what should i be using?
[05:17:39] <Hooloovoork> ajax and transfer data with json
[05:17:50] <Hooloovoork> not full nlown html sites
[05:17:52] <Hooloovoork> blown*
[05:17:56] <Andres75> @xec let me fix the trailing comma, the problem is as you might notice in Firebug, the canvases get appended only to the second DIV desipte my $('div') call
[05:17:57] <tomasm-> sometimes its json, sometimes its not
[05:18:11] <Hooloovoork> tomasm-: sounds like crappy server design
[05:18:37] <tomasm-> Hooloovoork, it depends on what it's being used for honestly, but the problem at hand...
[05:18:47] <xec> Andres75: ok, where (in code) is the canvas added?
[05:18:52] <Hooloovoork> tomasm-: use ajax() function
[05:19:05] <Hooloovoork> i'll tell you how to do it even tho i think it's a idiotic idea
[05:19:06] <Hooloovoork> i'm so nice
[05:19:26] <Hooloovoork> you send postdata in the ajax function that tells the server what div you want it in
[05:19:32] <Hooloovoork> and set datatype to html
[05:19:35] <Hooloovoork> done
[05:19:37] <Andres75> @xec > trailing comma is fixed, line 57 in my editor function setupScene($elm) {
[05:19:39] <Hooloovoork> oh also
[05:19:59] <Hooloovoork> when it comes back from the server, attach the html to a off-screen div and then puck out the element you want
[05:20:12] <Hooloovoork> that's how the load() function is built, and why it's idiotic
[05:21:49] <Cork> or you can just specify the id you want to grab
[05:22:12] <Hooloovoork> Cork: what do you mean?
[05:22:16] <Cork> $(selector).load('domain/url/path #id')
[05:23:18] <Hooloovoork> Cork: how do you think that happens? it can't request just one a part of a html page from the server
[05:23:38] <lokendra> testing
[05:23:46] <Andres75> Hey Cork, turns out the problem you helped me fix the day before yesterday generated another one ;)
[05:23:48] <Hooloovoork> it takes all of it and does something like var blah = $("<div>").html(serverresponse); blah.find("#div");
[05:23:52] <Cork> Hooloovoork: hmm sounds like i read what you meant wrong
[05:24:02] <lokendra> r u there
[05:24:18] <Cork> Hooloovoork: what i meant is, if you want to load just part of the html sent, you don't have to do that your self
[05:24:35] <Cork> but ya, the network overhead is imposible to not get
[05:24:40] <Hooloovoork> Cork: problem is he wanted to send the id of the div he wanted to grab to the server
[05:24:47] <Cork> (unless the server filters it)
[05:25:02] <Hooloovoork> and since i haven't used load() i didn't really know if it accepted postdata and told him how to do it the other way
[05:25:03] <Cork> Hooloovoork: thats defenitly posible :)
[05:25:12] <Cork> though you would have to have a server that can filter that
[05:25:22] <Cork> like a php script
[05:25:23] <beasty> hmm
[05:25:25] <Hooloovoork> this is so retarded D:
[05:25:35] <Hooloovoork> why is this even possible at all?
[05:25:41] <beasty> how do you guys keep a 'go-getting' attitude while programming js/jquery ?
[05:25:55] <Hooloovoork> beasty: moneys!
[05:26:18] <Cork> Hooloovoork: for example the server could have partials, that it uses to generate the full page, and when you request the page with a param with a spefici id
[05:26:26] <Cork> it only sends that partial from the full view
[05:26:32] <beasty> Hooloovoork: ok
[05:26:35] <beasty> but still ...
[05:26:37] <Cork> or it could dom fileter it, or... many other solutions
[05:26:49] <Cork> heck its common practis
[05:26:51] <beasty> i'm writing 3months js/jquery code now fulltime like 10hrs a day
[05:26:59] <beasty> and i'm getting pretty bored with it
[05:27:10] <Hooloovoork> Cork: it's just weird... why not generate that on the server request? and update with json?
[05:27:14] <Hooloovoork> it's faster
[05:27:42] <Hooloovoork> beasty: get another job if you don't like it. having a boring job isn't good for you.
[05:27:49] <beasty> i know
[05:27:50] <Cork> Hooloovoork: cause then you would have to be able to generate the markup on client side
[05:27:51] <beasty> but it pays good :p
[05:28:03] <Cork> and sending html in json is just bloat
[05:28:19] <Hooloovoork> Cork: sending html in json is stupid, yes.
[05:28:21] <Cork> so it all depends on what you need to send
[05:28:30] <Hooloovoork> uggh
[05:28:39] <Hooloovoork> ow well
[05:28:53] <Andres75> @xec > You still there?
[05:28:55] <Cork> for example if you have infinit scroll, and the content your sending is user entered cms html
[05:29:08] <Cork> then... the most efficient way is by sending the pure html fragments
[05:29:12] <xec> Andres75: yes
[05:29:27] <xec> Andres75: i think maybe the issue is the usage of ID's
[05:29:48] <Andres75> tried without
[05:29:58] <xec> Andres75: inside setupScene you are adding a canvas with an ID and then getElementByID
[05:29:59] <Cork> Andres75: not to but in, but what bugs did it generate?
[05:30:00] <Andres75> but nothing
[05:30:09] <Hooloovoork> Cork: the part that bothers me is that it's built in that you can pick out a element you want from the text blob you get.
[05:30:09] <xec> Andres75: but setupScene is called multiple times
[05:30:23] <xec> Andres75: and getElementById will always only get one element
[05:30:24] <Hooloovoork> Cork: like building a function that makes it easy to write crappy websites.
[05:30:43] <Cork> Hooloovoork: well you can't always control whats in the data you get
[05:30:49] <xec> Andres75: make sense?
[05:31:00] <Cork> Hooloovoork: and then its not a big deal to add this functionality
[05:31:01] <Andres75> @Cork > we fixed the single div targeting but applying the plugin to a generic $('div') now only appends to the second (last?) one
[05:31:10] <Cork> Hooloovoork: though, ya i agree, it shouldn't be used if posible
[05:31:23] <Andres75> @xec > might do, but it should remove those canvases
[05:31:37] <Cork> Andres75: so your back at the old problem again?
[05:31:45] <Cork> where it only adds it to one of the elements
[05:31:58] <Andres75> @ Cork > it's the other way round, but yes
[05:32:08] <Cork> ouch, good luck :)
[05:32:37] <Andres75> the complete path is > get selector > add canvases, do stuff > create image > remove canvas > get next selector, etc
[05:32:48] <Andres75> that's what I supposed
[05:33:15] <xec> Andres75: did you write the setupScene function?
[05:33:24] <xec> or is it from some other plugin
[05:33:33] <Andres75> @xec > naturally I have shortened the code now and there is no removal anymore
[05:33:58] <Andres75> it's partially from another code, let me get the link...
[05:34:29] <Andres75> here it is :  http://media.chikuyonok.ru/canvas-blending/
[05:34:58] <Cork> ok, should i but in a bit?
[05:35:26] <Andres75> it would be great, if I can get this problem solved it would take some pressure off
[05:35:30] <Cork> as the code is async, you can't generate anything that referes to uniq parts in the code
[05:35:51] <Cork> for example the part that adds the throbber adds a div with id="preload"
[05:36:06] <Andres75> oh it's about being async 'cos of image loading?
[05:36:11] <Cork> and the canvas elements if refered through ids
[05:36:15] <Cork> yes
[05:36:28] <Cork> all the images is generated more or less at the same time
[05:36:38] <Cork> of they can overlat at least
[05:36:44] <Cork> *overlap
[05:37:05] <Andres75> I need to find a way to wait for those to load, I tried implementing the defer method but with no luck
[05:37:06] <Cork> so you sould handle them in a way that doesn't need id's
[05:37:11] <Cork> not really
[05:37:23] <Cork> instead of doing .append('<canvas id="canvas2" width="" height="">')
[05:37:36] <Andres75> in one of my attempts I added a random hash to each canvas
[05:37:39] <Cork> do var $canvas2 = $('<canvas id="canvas2" width="" height="">');
[05:37:47] <Andres75> a n00b  approach
[05:37:50] <Cork> then do $elm.append($canvas2)
[05:37:50] <Andres75> :)
[05:37:57] <Andres75> ok gimme a sec
[05:38:07] <Cork> and then do ctx2 = $canvas2[0].getContext('2d');
[05:38:17] <Andres75> i think I tried that also
[05:38:19] <Cork> and again your using global variables there
[05:38:21] <Andres75> just a sec
[05:38:30] <Cork> you forgot to declare your ctx* variables
[05:38:40] <Cork> same with offset*
[05:38:44] <Andres75> line 37?
[05:38:54] <caaakeeey> what are people's opinions on d3.js?
[05:38:59] <Cork> opps sorry its futher up
[05:39:20] <Cork> Andres75: ya, but that makes them function global
[05:39:50] <Cork> Andres75: and they need to be function scoped
[05:40:30] <Andres75> ok gimme a sec to apply changes and upload
[05:41:00] <Cork> Andres75: when things is async, all you really have to do is make sure that the thread called, is always contained
[05:41:21] <Cork> as long as it doesn't use shared variables, your find (shared variables for reading from is fine)
[05:42:47] <Cork> Andres75: ugg i just realized your checking --totalImages
[05:42:58] <Cork> so your only calling setupScene once?
[05:43:23] * Cork is not sure how thats soppose to work
[05:43:46] * Andres75 feels ashamed
[05:44:18] <Andres75> setupScene should be called once for each
[05:44:33] <Cork> ya, i'm not sure what that if statement is meant to do at all
[05:44:37] <Andres75> this.each(function(){ setupScene });
[05:44:46] <Andres75> that was the goal
[05:45:25] <Cork> ah, wait your loading multible images for each element?
[05:45:33] <Andres75> once total images has reached 0 it runs the setupscene for the given object (which has its own set of images)
[05:45:43] <Andres75> exactly
[05:45:44] <Cork> then... heh
[05:45:48] <Cork> stop your work XD
[05:45:52] <Cork> the is backwards
[05:46:07] <Cork> then the plugin starts you should fetch the images
[05:46:18] <Cork> loops over them all and bind load events
[05:46:35] <Cork> when the events has all fired (like you check it now)
[05:46:40] <Cork> you should call the this.each
[05:46:46] <Cork> (but not on this)
[05:47:01] <Cork> use something like var elements = this; at the beginning
[05:47:02] <Andres75> hm... so you mean load images OUT of the loop
[05:47:17] <Cork> no do the loop when you've loaded all the images once
[05:47:31] <Cork> you only have one settings for all elements, so why load the images multible times?
[05:47:57] <Cork> heck you could prob even go all the canvas rendering first too
[05:47:58] <Andres75> the plugin can be called with different settings...
[05:48:12] <Cork> ya, but each time is a new call to iCompose
[05:48:24] <Cork> all we need to care about in here is multi selectors
[05:48:48] <Andres75> ok... I'm trying to follow, but you are too fast for my brain
[05:49:13] <Cork> Andres75: 1) $('div').iCompose(settings)
[05:49:21] <Andres75> yes
[05:49:26] <Cork> this calls the plugin function with the set number of settings
[05:49:39] <Andres75> ok, I undestand now
[05:49:42] <Cork> then all you need to do is calculate the images and compose it
[05:49:47] <ryannathans> on this page -- https://wegift.org/  when you click register (top right), why doesn't the form fadeIn, it just appears suddenly?
[05:49:55] <Andres75> true, in that case
[05:49:58] <Cork> Andres75: then loop the elements and add the image multible times
[05:50:11] <Cork> that would simplify the code quite a bit
[05:50:14] <Andres75> definitely true... didn't think about that
[05:50:33] <Andres75> would you be up for some paid work ;) via paypal naturally
[05:50:51] <Cork> Andres75: though you still have to leave id's out, as you can still call two iCompose at almost the same time
[05:51:13] <Cork> Andres75: the payment isn't needed :)
[05:51:26] <Andres75> well we can call it a donation
[05:51:28] <Andres75> :D
[05:52:43] <Andres75> doing it step by step with you is very enlightening, but I'd gladly get it done before and study it afterwards!
[05:53:11] <Andres75> anyhow if you prefer guiding me through it I'm more than willing to accept
[05:53:37] <Haruhi> Question: does html() remove <script> tags?
[05:53:46] <Hooloovoork> Haruhi: yes
[05:54:13] <ryannathans> is anyone currently reading my question/source?
[05:54:20] <Hooloovoork> nope
[05:54:39] <ryannathans> could you please help?
[05:55:21] <Haruhi> thanks.
[05:55:47] <Andres75> @Cork > did my last remarks scare you off? :)
[05:56:39] <mzilla> it seems that the revert option on jQuery sortable triggers the click of all child elements
[05:57:07] <mzilla> at least, hidden div's in my draggable element get visible when I enable revert
[05:57:13] <mzilla> (and perform a revert)
[05:57:18] <mzilla> isn't that strange?
[05:57:54] <Hooloovoork> ryannathans: you're doing something weird. try using this for replacing the article content $('article').hide(function() { $(this).html(data) });
[05:58:21] <ryannathans> Hooloovoork: thanks, I'll try that
[05:58:38] <Hooloovoork> ryannathans: no wait $('article').hide(function() { $(this).html(data) }).fadeIn();
[05:58:45] <Hooloovoork> and remove the article fade in you have there now
[05:58:48] <Hooloovoork> and remove the timeout
[05:59:04] <Cork> Andres75: http://pastebin.com/k3yu1B9T
[05:59:10] <Cork> this should get you a part of the way
[05:59:22] <Cork> its far from complete, but it should show some of what i mean
[05:59:56] <Cork> Andres75: line 99 is meant to get an img tag back with the generated image
[06:02:08] <Andres75> interesting, a lot to learn... sec
[06:02:22] <Andres75> yes, I understand
[06:02:38] <Hooloovoork> Cork: what's it for?
[06:02:42] <Hooloovoork> lots of canvases...
[06:02:45] <tooter> hey folks - anyone know if i can achieve something like http://people.flamegreen.net/~chris/test_screen_v1.jpg but in an x-browser way ? :)
[06:02:59] <Andres75> I need to try it out and see, does it append correctly?
[06:03:05] <Cork> Hooloovoork: the code i saw yesterday is composing multible images
[06:03:05] * tooter struggles to describe the effect
[06:03:11] <Hooloovoork> tooter: yes, like a image =P
[06:03:22] <Cork> Andres75: that pb is more or less completly broken
[06:03:28] <Hooloovoork> Cork: ahhh nice.
[06:03:42] <Cork> Andres75: its meant to show the structure more then anything else
[06:03:53] <Andres75> ok i just uploaded it : /
[06:03:55] <mathi> hi
[06:04:13] <Cork> Andres75: one thing that prevented me from writeing something working was that i couldn't find the composing code
[06:04:13] <mathi> when I hover a span containing text, I would like to make the color of the text more dark
[06:04:18] <mathi> how is it possible to achieve this?
[06:04:27] <ryannathans> wow that's awsome, thanks Hooloovoork!
[06:05:23] <Andres75> it's not there, I was asked to create a short version of the code for faster debugging but you can find all the code (compositing works at least) at the following url : http://www.psfinteractive.it/bigoom/jqt.html
[06:05:42] <mathi> anyone?
[06:07:42] <Andres75> $('span').hover(function(){ this.css('color','#666') });
[06:08:44] <tooter> i'd like the main image to be composed of 12 smaller squares - that are able to 'rotate/squew' in the z-axis (or appear to)
[06:09:06] <tom[]> if i want to POST a form with $.ajax(), is data:$('#form_id').serialize() the way to go?
[06:10:15] <Andres75> @ Cork > what's your paypal address ?
[06:10:39] <Hooloovoork> tom[]: that'll prolly work, yes.
[06:12:21] <tom[]> and if i want to add another param/val pair that's not in the form before sending the ajax request?
[06:23:17] <Cork> Andres75: http://pastebin.com/CQHLMLzw
[06:23:24] <Cork> this is all the time i can spend on it
[06:23:57] <Cork> but your wellcome to ask question if you want to
[06:24:51] <Andres75> var $canvas1.remove(); should be without var I assume?
[06:25:14] <Cork> lol, defenitly :D
[06:25:35] <Cork> as you might notice, this code isn't tested :)
[06:25:58] <Andres75> just upped it
[06:26:19] <Cork> andornaut: and the var mwStr, clsStr and idStr can all be removed
[06:26:23] <Cork> line 183-185
[06:26:47] <Cork> its replaced by line 181
[06:27:01] <Andres75> Besides my will to donate, are you available as a freelancer?
[06:27:26] <Cork> nope
[06:27:34] <Andres75> all right... :(
[06:27:39] <Cork> i have a fulltime job (where i'm at right now actually)
[06:28:52] <Andres75> so you're not accepting donations either?
[06:28:58] <Cork> no need
[06:29:09] <Andres75> all right then you have my gratitude
[06:29:10] <Andres75> :D
[06:29:16] <Cork> yw :)
[06:29:23] <Cork> and good luck
[06:29:23] <MariusKarthaus> Is it possible to change the style settings for a class? (so that future objects that are created also get the changed style?)
[06:29:46] <Cork> MariusKarthaus: yes you can modify the stylescheet
[06:30:15] <MariusKarthaus> Cork: should I do that with a document write with new style tag or can I manipulate directlr ?
[06:30:33] <Cork> MariusKarthaus: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/stylesheet
[06:30:57] <Cork> MariusKarthaus: the recomended way is to create an overide class and just apply that to the element instead
[06:31:05] <Andres75> @Cork > k, thanks a bunch, just one last q: is it still necessary to defer the code to when the images have loaded?
[06:31:06] <Cork> but, to answer your question, yes you can
[06:31:26] <Cork> Andres75: yes, and the image might not be in memory
[06:31:44] <Cork> Andres75: even if its disk cache it might be enough to give prolem if you don't wait for it
[06:32:03] <Cork> *yes, as the image
[06:32:07] <Andres75> ok, cheers for that info. I'll try and look into that, maybe post you the link to the code on here XD
[06:32:29] <Cork> happy typing :)
[06:32:41] <hazamonzo_> Hey folks. Is it possible (and easy) to remove any and all &nbsp; from a table
[06:32:52] <hazamonzo_> i want to search the whole table for this content and remove it
[06:33:00] <Cork> hazamonzo_: no its not
[06:33:10] <Cork> its actually really complicated
[06:33:13] <hazamonzo_> Cork: Dang. But thats for the direct answer :D
[06:33:34] <MariusKarthaus> Cork:  the call to apply that to elements only works on 'current' elements, not future elements. So i'll keep walking all elements, adding classes after each time new elements are created. Seems like a waste. Changing the stylesheet for the existing class will make sure I only need to do it once.
[06:33:39] <hazamonzo_> In that case i'll have to figure out why im getting this nbsp in the first place
[06:34:05] <Cork> MariusKarthaus: not nessesary, you could add the class to a parent
[06:34:09] <Cork> even body
[06:36:09] <Andres75> @Cork > still got the append problem ... guess that's the most difficult part of it
[06:36:37] <Cork> Andres75: same link as before?
[06:36:48] <Andres75> file:///D:/sites/bigoom/jqt-short.html
[06:36:51] <Andres75> oops
[06:37:08] <Andres75> http://www.psfinteractive.it/bigoom/jqt-short.html
[06:37:17] <Andres75> still wont append
[06:37:30] <scr3am> definitely on windows, ey?
[06:37:51] <Andres75> XD
[06:38:05] <Cork> Andres75: i don't see any element problems
[06:38:11] <Cork> so what are you refering to?
[06:38:35] <Andres75> in firebug I only see canvases appended to div.two
[06:38:41] <Cork> Andres75: oh, you missed all the fixes down with the loop
[06:38:48] <xmaddness> has anyone noticed that jQuery's remove() construct is slow in removing checkboxes?
[06:38:57] * xmaddness is getting a weird latency
[06:39:05] <Cork> Andres75: there shouldn't be any canvas appended to the divs at all
[06:39:24] <Cork> Andres75: the code i posted puts them in the body, and uses them once
[06:39:40] <MariusKarthaus> Cork: thank you
[06:39:49] <Cork> MariusKarthaus: np
[06:40:27] <Andres75> @Cork > http://pastebin.com/CQHLMLzw <- this, correct?
[06:40:50] <Cork> Andres75: yes
[06:41:17] <Cork> Andres75: line 200 - 229
[06:42:03] <Cork> Andres75: ugg, sorry about that, cache -_-'
[06:42:09] <Cork> when i pressed f5 it was there XD
[06:43:42] <Andres75> http://www.psfinteractive.it/bigoom/iComposer.jquery.0.1-short.js
[06:43:48] <Cork> ya
[06:44:01] <Cork> my browser cache gave me an old copy
[06:44:07] <Andres75> that is the correct code right?
[06:44:14] <Cork> yes
[06:44:40] <Cork> Andres75: the flow is meant to be 1) add throbbers to the elements; 2) bind the load events 3) wait for the events
[06:44:46] <Cork> 4) render the image
[06:44:54] <Cork> 5) generate an image tag
[06:45:04] <Cork> 6) add a copy of it to each element in the selector
[06:45:31] <Cork> 6) is myElement.append(image.clone());
[06:45:33] <Andres75> I don't understand why but the canvases seem to get appended to div.two in my firebug (?)
[06:45:47] <Cork> not here
[06:45:57] <Cork> its in body, where they should be
[06:46:14] * Andres75 is perplexed about this X-File
[06:47:03] <Cork> Andres75: http://imagebin.org/194447
[06:47:59] <Andres75> lol in chrome it works...
[06:48:04] <Andres75> must be a cache issue
[06:48:35] <Andres75> yep now it's correct
[06:48:53] <Andres75> my bad i guess
[06:48:55] <Andres75> sorry
[06:48:56] <kul> any suggestion for nice twitter scroller based on jquery and easily editable ?
[06:49:11] <kul> I tried googling it but cant find anything too interesting
[06:49:19] <kul> ?
[06:49:33] <Eviltwin> Sometimes you need to make things yourself
[06:50:58] <kul> yea Eviltwin thats wat I'm doing now :)
[06:51:11] <starkid> hi there.. :D
[06:51:13] <caesargus> you mean I have to do work?
[06:51:20] <kul> but thought if some1 already knew some plugin it would save my time :)
[06:51:39] <Cork> Andres75: anyway i gtg now, might try to connect from home though (that'll be ca 1h away though)
[06:51:47] <starkid> i have a trouble with my datetimepicker
[06:55:11] <starkid> when i choose a date and time and i wanna choose again dont show the datetimepicker selector... :$
[06:55:52] <jeffreylevesque> if i say: $('#image li img).mouseover( stuff );  does that mean every list image has a mouse over effect?  or is it better to do something like this (each <li> has class rotator-#): $('#image .rotator-' + val1 + ' img').mouseover( stuff ).
[06:58:47] <dmhardison> so, google chrome is constantly breaking on the try/catch sstatement which is commented on this should failw ith exception of gecko and it's really annoying... it seems like it shouldn't since it's a TRY/CATCH.... is there a setting i have wrong or is this what i have to deal with?
[06:59:42] <dmhardison> does this happen to other people... or just me.
[07:00:17] <dmhardison> i guess i can just set pseudoWorks to true always.... and swap in the production code version if i need it.
[07:00:39] <Eviltwin> dmhardison: http://code.google.com/chrome/devtools/docs/scripts-breakpoints.html
[07:01:43] <dmhardison> ... ohhhhh ...
[07:01:51] <dmhardison> Eviltwin: thanks....
[07:04:05] <jeffreylevesque> anyone have a moment lol?
[07:07:16] <gyzmodo> i am learning jQuery
[07:07:30] <Hooloovoork> gyzmodo: gj
[07:07:44] <gyzmodo> and i am looking for a book
[07:07:55] <gyzmodo> any recommendations?
[07:08:21] <gyzmodo> a the moment i am reading jQuery in Action 2nd edition
[07:08:40] <JAAulde> gyzmodo: are you good at JavaScript?
[07:08:52] <gyzmodo> nope
[07:08:58] <gyzmodo> i am very newbie in JS
[07:09:06] <JAAulde> gyzmodo: then quit trying to learn jQ and learn JS
[07:09:18] <Eviltwin> ?learn @ gyzmodo
[07:09:19] <bot-t> gyzmodo, First learn JavaScript (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/learn/javascript) then learn jQuery (http://jqfundamentals.com/)
[07:09:25] <JAAulde> O'Reilly's JavaScript, The Definitive Guide is the book you should be reading
[07:09:35] <gyzmodo> haha
[07:09:36] <gyzmodo> :)
[07:10:26] <gyzmodo> Eviltwin as always in his style ;)
[07:11:54] <gyzmodo> thanks JAAulde and Eviltwin
[07:12:01] <JAAulde> yw
[07:15:28] <gyzmodo> Eviltwin, dude i was looking for $('.twitter-inner').css({'height':(($('.post').height()))});
[07:15:30] <gyzmodo> this code
[07:15:43] <Eviltwin> What did we tell you
[07:15:51] <Eviltwin> Learn JavaScript
[07:16:17] <gyzmodo> come ooooooooooooooonnnnnnnn
[07:16:21] <gyzmodo> dont be so serious
[07:16:48] <the_voice-> hi
[07:17:06] <_johnny> gyzmodo: $(".twitter-inner").css("height":$(".post").height()); if you want to save some of the excessive chars ;)
[07:17:15] <_johnny> sorry, : -> ,
[07:17:15] <_johnny> :P
[07:17:25] <the_voice-> I am having a problem when I am calling a function
[07:17:49] <the_voice-> it's not going through my $.ajax({
[07:18:39] <gyzmodo> _johnny, something wrong with this code?
[07:19:26] <mzilla> is there a good jQuery plugin that works like the behaviour WordPress admin's custom menu list
[07:19:55] <the_voice-> http://pastebin.com/iyuA8The
[07:20:22] <the_voice-> is there anything wrong with the script I posted?
[07:20:23] <gyzmodo> _johnny, i was need inline style
[07:20:55] <_johnny> no, it's just redundant
[07:21:31] <gyzmodo> thanks anyways!
[07:21:46] <the_voice-> _johnny any chance you can take a look at my pastebin
[07:21:55] <the_voice-> the first alert is occurring the second is not
[07:23:07] <kborchers> the_voice-: have you tried adding an error callback or using firebug or chrome inspector to see if you are actually reaching that URL and what is being returned?
[07:23:18] <_johnny> second is "here"? probably because the request fails. try adding complete: function() { alert("well, i did finish"); }, error: function() { alert("ERROR!"); }
[07:25:06] <the_voice-> strange I am getting an error
[07:25:14] <the_voice-> but when I do focus on the text box
[07:25:25] <the_voice-> I call the same function and there is no error, in fact it works perfectly..
[07:25:50] <the_voice-> * not function I mean ajax script
[07:25:52] <kborchers> the_voice-: probably something wrong with the JSON would be my guess
[07:26:07] <the_voice-> hmm
[07:26:47] <_johnny> error: function(xhr, status, err) { console.log(xhr, err); } and check console
[07:26:58] <_ramo> hi
[07:26:59] <kborchers> the_voice-: or might be a server error. what status code are you getting
[07:27:08] <kborchers> yah, what _johnny said :)
[07:27:36] <the_voice-> how do I check that kborchers?
[07:27:39] <the_voice-> sorry query is not my speciality
[07:27:43] <the_voice-> *jquery
[07:27:52] <kborchers> the_voice-: look at what _johnny wrote ^^
[07:28:02] <_ramo> does someone use the jquery UI autocomplete plugin? i'm running into an issue that when searching for an item, the list appears, but if i want to use "keydown" i get an error in the console: Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'top' of nulla.widget.activatejquery-ui.min.js:12a.widget.movejquery-ui.min.js:12a.widget.nextjquery-ui.min.js:12a.widget._movejquery-ui.min.js:12a.widget._create.element.addClass.attr.attr.bind.bind.djquery-ui.min.js:
[07:28:12] <_ramo> any ideas what that could be?
[07:28:25] <_johnny> the_voice-: do you have the console (firebug or "inspect element") in your browser?
[07:28:47] <the_voice-> thanks
[07:28:57] <the_voice-> will also run it, I am running safari on my mac, will install firefox now
[07:29:08] <scr3am> press F12
[07:29:10] <_johnny> unless you're on IE, console.log should contain an object in tree view, and an error text
[07:29:16] <_johnny> ok great
[07:29:20] <_johnny> safari on mac is fine
[07:30:00] <_johnny> top menu: Develop -> Show Error Console
[07:30:26] <mathi> hi
[07:30:44] <mathi> how can I get the html of an element, but with the element included?
[07:30:55] <mathi> .html() will only give me the inner html of the element
[07:32:14] <Hooloovoork> mathi: clone and append
[07:32:19] <Hooloovoork> then get the html from that
[07:33:41] <mathi> heh
[07:34:09] <mathi> i'm not that advance
[07:34:12] <mathi> d
[07:36:06] <_johnny> mathi: i think he means like this: $(<your element>).clone().remove().html()
[07:36:11] <xec> $("<div>").append(mySelection).html()
[07:36:14] <mathi> I could use wrap
[07:36:15] <xec> something like that?
[07:36:17] <mathi> then get the html
[07:36:18] <mathi> right?
[07:36:46] <_johnny> mathi: what i just pasted gets the element + innerHTML as a string
[07:36:52] <_johnny> which is what i assume you want?
[07:37:14] <_johnny> or no, sorry. what xec said
[07:37:20] <mathi> _johnny, yep, why in this case html() returns the element also?
[07:37:22] <mathi> ah ok
[07:37:30] <_johnny> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/652763/jquery-object-to-string
[07:37:49] <mathi> shouldn't it be $('<div></div>').... ???
[07:38:14] <xec> ?tias
[07:38:14] <bot-t> Try It And See
[07:38:17] <_johnny> yes
[07:38:53] <xec> you do not need to close elements you are creating in a string passed to jquery, afaik
[07:39:20] <mathi> are you sure of that?
[07:39:41] <xec> mathi: pretty sure, but try it and see, like bot-t suggested
[07:39:53] <the_voice-> I am getting Object "" on the error: line
[07:40:05] <xec> ?botsnack
[07:40:05] <bot-t> Thank you! OMNOMNOMNOMNOM
[07:40:06] <mathi> well, both work
[07:40:49] <jeffsmykil_> how do I do if element is present
[07:40:53] <jeffsmykil_> not just visible
[07:40:56] <jeffsmykil_> but there
[07:41:02] <xec> how do you do what?
[07:41:25] <_johnny> the_voice-: but also a xhr Object, right? console.log(xhr);
[07:41:39] <jeffsmykil_> if ($("#foo").isInPage()) { }
[07:41:48] <the_voice-> yes both xhr and error
[07:41:55] <xec> jeffsmykil_: you can use .length
[07:41:56] <the_voice-> it's showing Object "" twice
[07:42:02] <jeffsmykil_> xec good idea
[07:42:12] <the_voice-> I am installing firefox and firebug, I prefer it
[07:42:13] <xec> jeffsmykil_: if ($("#foo").length)
[07:42:31] <jeffsmykil_> can I do !$("#foo").length?
[07:43:00] <xec> jeffsmykil_: hmm.. i think so
[07:43:07] <jeffsmykil_> ty
[07:43:22] <xec> jeffsmykil_: or you can do .length === 0
[07:44:10] <Andres75>  /leave
[07:44:12] <jeffsmykil_> thanks
[07:44:12] <Andres75> ops
[07:44:29] <_johnny> the_voice-: error: function(xhr, status, error) { console.log(xhr); } should give you an object which you can unfold
[07:44:53] <the_voice-> one sec
[07:47:12] <the_voice-> okay I understand what is causing the problem
[07:47:42] <the_voice-> I didn't use on click, I used form  onSubmit="return check_phonenumber()">
[07:48:21] <the_voice-> I think I figured out the problem
[07:48:30] <_johnny> good :)
[07:48:38] <the_voice-> I was calling  onSubmit="return check_phonenumber()"
[07:48:46] <the_voice-> instead of having the call to the function in the submit area
[07:48:51] <the_voice-> but that brings up another question
[07:48:52] <the_voice-> :)
[07:49:11] <Y4m3> Hello guys, i have a container div with 2 images in next to each other. Now, I let one image fade but then the second one "snaps" into the first one his place. How can I program it that the 2nd image will replace the first with a smooth animation?
[07:49:17] <the_voice-> I want it to run like a regular form that is blocked if validation fails, but will still work without js
[07:50:12] <the_voice-> so in regular JS I would have <form action="some url.php" onSubmit="return check_phonenumber()">
[07:50:21] <the_voice-> how would I do the equivalent in jQuery
[07:50:24] <_johnny> the_voice-: if you can rely on html5, then you can use pattern="regexp for input value validation"
[07:50:42] <the_voice-> nah I can't yet rely on html5 :
[07:50:43] <the_voice-> :(
[07:50:50] <_johnny> how is that without js?
[07:50:55] <the_voice-> it is
[07:51:08] <the_voice-> but if there is no js it still calls the php function
[07:51:28] <the_voice-> with js it just can pause it if check_Phonenumber() returns false
[07:51:51] <the_voice-> in jQuery if I run it like that I get an error in the jQuery(as I just discovered :) )
[07:52:03] <_johnny> but if js is disabled you just want the user to be able to fill out whatever and submit?
[07:52:15] <the_voice-> he will get the error back from PHP
[07:52:33] <aro> if i have an element: <div id="test">test</div> - is there a way to get the whole element?
[07:52:52] <_johnny> $("#<id of the phonenumber input-element>").bind("blur", check_Phonenumber)
[07:53:17] <polygonpusher> I'm working with a php var where the html is not in the dom, if I was to echo out the html into a java var could jquery iterate over the html in string var?
[07:53:17] <_johnny> that'll check before submitting. or just bind on the form submition like you do now
[07:53:32] <polygonpusher> js var*
[07:53:40] <the_voice-> thanks
[07:53:42] <the_voice-> I will try it now
[07:53:52] <_johnny> if you return false in the submit function, the form will *not* be submitted
[07:54:06] <_johnny> or, use .preventDefault() to be sure ;)
[07:54:46] <_johnny> $("#<your form>").submit(check_Phonenumber) and have your function return true or false
[07:55:29] <aro> basically i want to store the whole thing in a variable.. the <div id="test">test</div> etc
[07:56:17] <_johnny> aro: hehe, we had that question 20 mins ago. see http://stackoverflow.com/questions/652763/jquery-object-to-string
[07:56:51] <swashington> Hey, does anyone have a few spare moments to help me out? I'm trying to have an element on the page set to fixed until it hits the top of the footer (keeping the menu from flowing over the footer).
[07:57:06] <aro> what
[07:57:07] <aro> hmm
[07:57:16] <aro> i dont want to append it to another element tho, i need to store it in a var
[07:57:36] <swashington> I've seen a few plugins that do this but they're buggy as hell. There has to be a simple way of doing it.
[07:57:46] <_johnny> $("<div></div>").append($(<your element>).clone()).html() is a variable, a string to be exact.
[07:57:55] <Hooloovoork> aro: well, that's what you gotta do to store it in a var
[07:57:59] <aro> ok
[07:58:02] <aro> thanks :)
[07:58:08] <_johnny> np
[08:00:06] <matt1982_> hmm anyone know the best way to make a table and when I click an edit button at the end of a row it turns that row into a form. The edit button becomes a save button. Im not sure if it is a plugin or not. I did think i could make two versions of a table row, one standard the other a form then switch between the two. Any other ideas?
[08:00:53] <pifantastic> matt1982_: there are some plugins that do that already, I believe
[08:00:53] <the_voice-> almost works perfectly
[08:01:06] <the_voice-> if someone submits an empty value it is not called
[08:01:11] <Y4m3> I have 2 div elements. I let the first one fade, when the fade is done the 2nd div snaps in the first one his place. Can I make the "snap" a smooth transition?
[08:01:37] <matt1982_> pifantastic, hmm any ideas what to google I dont seem to be hitting much luck.
[08:01:59] <matt1982_> pifantastic, it did seem like something a plugin would be made for too
[08:02:42] <sailboat> does anyone recommend a good jquery tutorial?
[08:04:28] <andrew9183> sailboat: www.jqfundamentals.com
[08:07:01] <swashington> Hey, does anyone have a few spare moments to help me out? I'm trying to have an element on the page set to fixed until it hits the top of the footer (keeping the menu from flowing over the footer).
[08:07:33] <slax> Guys, if i bind click() to a link, will it always execute the jQuery code i assign it before following the link?
[08:07:41] <matt1982_> pifantastic, i did find this: http://www.datatables.net/release-datatables/examples/api/editable.html
[08:07:48] <NoiseEee> slax: nope
[08:07:57] <slax> How can I make sure it does?
[08:08:11] <NoiseEee> stop the event, do what you want, then send them to the new URL through JS
[08:08:51] <slax> Thanks
[08:09:24] <NoiseEee> np see stopPropagationhttp://api.jquery.com/event.stopPropagation/
[08:09:49] <NoiseEee> sorry preventDefault()
[08:11:37] <slax> Oh wow this is amazing. I can't believe how many times I could have actually used this before but took the long way around it. Feel so silly for not looking for it earlier
[08:12:58] <danheberden> slax, you can also change the href in a click event on an anchor element
[08:13:07] <danheberden> then when it propagates, it'll follow that new url
[08:13:25] <markKZ> any reason the online docs wont work at all?
[08:13:48] <slax> Oh that's a nice solution to my problem
[08:14:02] <danheberden> (or on a child, so $el = $(this), $a = $(this).is('a') ? $el : $el.closest('a');
[08:14:23] <danheberden> then if( $a.length ){ /* was on or in an a tag */ }
[08:14:45] <danheberden> ugh, that was shitty code
[08:14:50] <danheberden> too early in the morning i tell ya!
[08:15:00] <danheberden> $el = $(this), $a = $el.is('a')....
[08:15:51] <NoiseEee> markKZ: weird
[08:16:12] <NoiseEee> markKZ: back up
[08:16:28] <slax> For my problem I suppose this would be overkill, I just need to redirect the user after a special link has been clicked. so in my click event i just need to do a window.location() :D
[08:16:40] <markKZ> NoiseEee, ya but still slow. guess nothing to do about it
[08:16:43] <swashington> Here is an example of what I'm running into - I want to use query to keep the menu from running into the footer. http://jsfiddle.net/CuufA/
[08:19:11] <markKZ> one more thing, if i bind a focusout to a class and i have like 10 objects in this class, how can i do something to the specific object that hit the event? like how do i refer to it? $(this) ?
[08:19:48] <NoiseEee> markKZ: yes, depending on how you've implemented it
[08:20:04] <markKZ> what do you mean?
[08:20:15] <sailboat> just because IRC is up, if I have a <div id="test">,  in jQuery I can place text by saing $("#test").append("Text"); right?
[08:20:45] <dabear_> ?append @ sailboat
[08:20:46] <dabear_> yes
[08:20:47] <bot-t> sailboat, .append(content, [content]): Insert content, specified by the parameter, to the end of each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/append/
[08:20:54] <NoiseEee> markKZ: $('.className').on('blur',function() { console.log(this); });
[08:21:18] <sailboat> dabear_: thanks for answering my newbie question :D
[08:21:24] <NoiseEee> markKZ: well 'this' can mean different things depending on how your script is set up, how you're assigning events, etc
[08:26:48] <xyphen> Hi guys, I'm trying to parse an ajax response with the jQuery constructor and it is stripping my head and body tags from it. Is this the expected behavior? This is an excerpt from my code: http://paste.pocoo.org/show/537327/
[08:27:27] <sailboat> speaking purely conceptually, (also because i'm new to web programming) Are cookies the best way to store session information?
[08:28:15] <sailboat> to be specific, I want to keep track of "activities" selected by a user
[08:28:45] <sailboat> the activities each have a time associated with them and I want the website to pop up an alarm if it's getting close to the time of any of the "activities the user selected
[08:29:12] <sailboat> problem is, I need to gurantee the alarm goes off even if the user browses away and then comes back
[08:29:23] <sailboat> (obviously the alarm wouldn't go off if the user wasn't there)
[08:32:25] <manisabri> Hi . Im using $.ajax (jquery 1.7.1) I return HHTPNotFound but the success method is called instead of error , any ideas?
[08:32:26] <aro> has anyone used jquery tools? I am trying to open the overlay programmatically
[08:34:29] <Taloncor> manisabri: You could check if your app responses are correct
[08:36:11] <manisabri> Taloncor:  I'm realy confused because the same response fires the error callback somewhere else ... it must be something in the $.ajax options . is it possible?
[08:38:10] <Taloncor> manisabri: could you provide a jsfiddle example?
[08:38:59] <manisabri> hmm, let me see whats what...
[08:39:16] <NoiseEee> manisabri: also you should now be using  var xhr = $.ajax( //etc );  xhr.done(function());  xhr.fail(function())
[08:39:23] <NoiseEee> manisabri: since you're on 1.7.1
[08:39:56] <manisabri> NoiseEee: tnx didn't know that
[08:39:56] <hazamonzo_> Hey folks. How can i aadd the cols attribute to this input? http://paste.ubuntu.com/809803/ something like $("#render_INPUT_TARGET_PERCENT").attr()   ?
[08:40:17] <hazamonzo_> it looks like the attr gets the attribute if i specify the attribute name
[08:40:31] <hazamonzo_> but what about adding a attribute to that input that doesn't already exist?
[08:40:36] <markKZ> um, if i have an event bound to some <input>, and it triggers fine, what would be the selector for the next <input> in the page? (diff parents tho)
[08:40:56] <markKZ> other than $(this).parent().parent().find("input").etc'
[08:41:14] <Taloncor> hazamonzo_: Just use .attr("attribute", value)
[08:41:35] <danheberden> hazamonzo_ might also be worth using prop, if you're looking to, like, actually set that value
[08:41:43] <aro> what is a good lightbox for ajax that auto resizes nicely? and looks good
[08:42:49] <danheberden> markKZ yeah, though i normally use closest to find a common parent - like $el.closest( '.post' ).next().find( '.wat' ) - but if you're using the dom for this kind of data storage, that might mean you have an architecture issue
[08:43:29] <markKZ> when 1 input is changed (or whatever triggered by), i need to change the val() of the next input in the page
[08:43:38] <Mookman288> I'm using .ajax or .getJSON to pull in data that is encoded using the php variable json_encode. For an unknown reason, out of the blue, I'm getting a syntax error that states: Syntax Error arguments: Array[1] 0: "<" length: 1 __proto__: Array[0]. If I copy the output, and put it through JSONLint, it comes back clean. If I replace the json_encode with the content, it reads it fine. This was working about an hour ago. Any ideas h
[08:43:41] <markKZ> whats my best shot?
[08:43:50] <NoiseEee> markKZ: you can make it easier if you class/id things you'll be working with...
[08:44:11] <markKZ> NoiseEee its a pretty large form, im automating its deployment through php
[08:44:23] <NoiseEee> regardless
[08:44:28] <markKZ> what do you suggest?
[08:44:35] <NoiseEee> markKZ: not sure how matters really
[08:44:47] <NoiseEee> markKZ: surely these other elements that interest you have name attribtues and hopefully IDs
[08:44:52] <NoiseEee> markKZ: so use those
[08:45:04] <markKZ> that'll require a different id for each of them i assume?
[08:45:15] <hazamonzo_> hmmm i tried $("#render_INPUT_TARGET_PERCENT").attr("cols", 5);  and get http://paste.ubuntu.com/809814/
[08:45:15] <markKZ> and another trigger and such as well?
[08:45:30] <hazamonzo_> i've messed something obvoius im sure :)
[08:45:36] <NoiseEee> markKZ: well if your form means anything at all, you already KNOW the name of the field you want to get to 'next'
[08:45:55] <NoiseEee> markKZ: because it's <input name='somethingIKnowAndCareAbout'>.  so grab it by its name attribute.
[08:46:16] <Taloncor> hazamonzo_: Whats the problem? ;-)
[08:46:17] <markKZ> NoiseEee well, yes, it does have names, but what ims aying is that have dozens of inputs in this form
[08:46:30] <markKZ> and im trying not to use a different trigger for each of them
[08:46:38] <hazamonzo_> Taloncor: oh if you look at the pastebin i don't get the cols set. instead i get a +=
[08:46:47] <markKZ> or i might be misunderstanding.
[08:46:54] <hazamonzo_> i was hoping to add the attribute coles="5"
[08:47:00] <hazamonzo_> umm
[08:47:02] <hazamonzo_> *cols
[08:47:07] <NoiseEee> markKZ: $('#formID input').on('click',function() { //holy cow, every input is firing this!! });
[08:47:33] <markKZ> NoiseEee yes, this is hwo its like atm, just with a class
[08:47:47] <NoiseEee> markKZ: so im not really understanding what your issue is.
[08:47:48] <markKZ> but a field that triggers this has to edit the value of the _next_ field
[08:47:59] <hazamonzo_> wait... i am being a spaz
[08:48:06] <Taloncor> hazamonzo_: The cols get set. Just look at the end of the tag. cols="5">
[08:48:18] <ianyo> .siblings() ?
[08:48:19] <hazamonzo_> Taloncor: i just noticed that. its been a loooong day
[08:48:20] <NoiseEee> markKZ: how odd / not what a user expects when filling out a form
[08:48:21] <markKZ> and the _next_ field isnt $(this).next()
[08:48:33] <markKZ> what do you mean by that
[08:48:53] <NoiseEee> markKZ: you mean those inputs are updating values automagically ?
[08:49:00] <markKZ> yes.
[08:49:10] <markKZ> they are updating the values of other inputs
[08:49:34] <markKZ> every .someclass will update the value of the next input after it
[08:49:41] <NoiseEee> markKZ: what is 'next' input?
[08:49:48] <hazamonzo_> Taloncor: whats odd is now even though the cols are set the input doesn't care lol :)
[08:50:40] <markKZ> http://pastebin.com/pTubB24U
[08:50:42] <markKZ> this is part of it
[08:50:49] <sviatovigt> hi
[08:50:58] <sviatovigt> where can I post some code?
[08:51:03] <markKZ> the .timeInput inputs should update the next input
[08:51:14] <markKZ> c11 would update c12
[08:51:21] <hazamonzo_> sviatovigt: pastebin i would guess ;)
[08:51:35] <sviatovigt> `pastebin
[08:51:36] <Taloncor> hazamonzo_: Maybe because 'cols' isn't a valid option for an input ;-)
[08:51:46] * hazamonzo_ bangs his head off the desk
[08:51:55] <NoiseEee> markKZ: then grab the name c11 (its the $this, the element clicked), drop the letter, then search for the input named 'c'+thatNumber
[08:52:04] <Taloncor> hazamonzo_: Either you are looking for a textarea or for the size attribute
[08:52:06] <NoiseEee> thatNumber+1, i should say
[08:52:06] <hazamonzo_> Im losing my bloody mind
[08:52:07] <sviatovigt> I know that there is a command that makes the irc bot to tell me the address
[08:52:13] <sviatovigt> but I don't know it
[08:52:54] <hazamonzo_> Taloncor: thanks for the second set of eyes :)
[08:53:04] <EdwardIII> hey
[08:53:22] <EdwardIII> having a go at creating a little gallery using css3 transitions: http://jsfiddle.net/kjucM/
[08:53:26] <EdwardIII> couple of issues
[08:53:31] <Taloncor> hazamonzo_: you're welcome
[08:53:51] <sviatovigt> `paste
[08:53:55] <sviatovigt> `bin
[08:54:55] <EdwardIII> 1) how can i stack up the items? the width of the container is the width of a single gallery item, so they don't line up horizontally (see result)
[08:55:02] <markKZ> can you point me to the function that would allow me to strip the 'c' and increase the number?
[08:55:18] <NoiseEee> markKZ: thats some basic javascript i'm going to leave to you to figure out
[08:55:21] <sviatovigt> can someone please tell where can I paste some code?
[08:56:54] <Taloncor> sviatovigt: look at the channel title. jsfiddle.net
[08:57:49] <sviatovigt> thanks
[08:57:57] <sviatovigt> I didn't knew it was there
[08:58:51] <EdwardIII> maybe i should use a <ul>...
[08:59:15] <larzen-wrk> question... is there a selector that will only return the immediate children of the parent?
[08:59:53] <larzen-wrk> say I have a nest of <li>, i only want the immediate level 1 children.
[09:00:15] <danheberden> children('li')
[09:00:35] <larzen-wrk> myObject.children('li') >
[09:00:58] <danheberden> you gots it
[09:01:04] <danheberden> where 'myObject' is a ul
[09:01:06] <xec> more like $('selector').children()
[09:01:29] <danheberden> xec well, it sounds like he cached his selector, which is awesome sauce
[09:01:38] <larzen-wrk> beauty!
[09:01:48] <xec> danheberden: looked to me like he was using the > child selector
[09:02:08] <danheberden> ah
[09:02:26] <xec> but i guess it was a typo
[09:02:43] <danheberden> larzen-wrk fwiw, $( 'ul' ).children( 'li' ) will be faster than $( 'ul > li' )
[09:03:15] <r1pp3rj4ck> going home, guys, thanks for the help
[09:03:25] <tehfedaykin> hey, i'm trying to play with a demo(http://tympanus.net/Tutorials/ParallaxSlider/), and am trying to switch from using images to divs.
[09:03:34] <r1pp3rj4ck> see ya
[09:03:39] <markKZ> NoiseEee $('c'.$(this).attr('name').substr(1)+1)
[09:03:46] <markKZ> would something like this be a valid selector?
[09:04:40] <tehfedaykin> I'm not sure why changing $images = $pxs_slider_wrapper.find('img'); to my div and class won't work
[09:04:52] <nFFF> Anything wrong with this jQuery: http://jsfiddle.net/mydyG/
[09:04:53] <danheberden> markKZ that just screams 'design flaw' :/  i don't mean that jerkish-ly, just that you might find a better way to relate that data and save you some crazy selectors and headaches :D
[09:04:54] <nFFF> not working
[09:05:10] <NoiseEee> markKZ: sure, but i (and the people following you) might find it more legible if you do that in a var
[09:06:36] <markKZ> danheberden id _love_ to get a better suggestion, i dont mind changing the arch and stuff.
[09:06:40] <xec> markKZ: are you trying to select a class? if so, it looks like you're missing the . prefix
[09:06:45] <NoiseEee> markKZ: var nextNum = $(this).attr('name').replace('c','')+1;  var nextEl = $('input [name="c'+nextNum+'"]');
[09:07:48] <markKZ> xec nop
[09:08:04] <xec> markKZ: oh its the name, nevermind
[09:09:09] <xec> markKZ: but you can find next one by traversing the tree instead, something like $(this).closest('.clearfix').next().find('input')
[09:10:25] <nFFF> xec if you get a chance: http://jsfiddle.net/mydyG/ -> taking the first word from the matched selector, adn using this 1st word for a URL and image
[09:10:42] <markKZ> now i've to deal with tidy escaping my <script> ^_^
[09:11:17] <nFFF> http://jsfiddle.net/mydyG/1/
[09:11:17] <NoiseEee> xec: his issue is that the 'next' item isn't a sibling of the current element
[09:11:23] <nFFF> ths might be a better example
[09:11:28] <NoiseEee> xec: and rather than traversing the DOM to get there, use selectors
[09:12:09] <xec> NoiseEee: yeah, i get that, i just feel traversing is a slightly more sane way to go about it
[09:12:41] <NoiseEee> xec: yeah, but slower, and if the markup changes, then it doesn't work anymore
[09:13:03] <markKZ> using tags would require that i fully write the whole form first
[09:13:32] <NoiseEee> markKZ: there's an awful lot to be said for structuring things the way YOU want it, then making it work versus trying to make things work with what you've got :)
[09:13:49] <xec> NoiseEee: well, the name could change too, and believe my method is better performance-wise, not that you would notice
[09:14:22] <NoiseEee> xec: its actually not (but i'd agree you'd be unlikely to notice).  you can jsperf a test and see selectors are just about always, if not 100% always, faster than selecting by DOM traversal
[09:14:25] <markKZ> can i add an extra attr to indicate the tag of the element to be edited?
[09:14:32] <NoiseEee> xec: just to be annoying about it :)
[09:14:57] <xec> markKZ: i would use a class name
[09:15:07] <markKZ> a class name for what
[09:15:13] <markKZ> for all the inputs?
[09:15:17] <xec> to select on, yes
[09:15:26] <markKZ> i have a class name for all of them.
[09:15:35] <xec> good :)
[09:15:51] <nFFF> Any jquery super guys want to help?: http://jsfiddle.net/mydyG/1/
[09:15:53] <markKZ> . . .
[09:15:55] <nFFF> 5 lines of code
[09:15:58] <nFFF> one massive headache
[09:17:18] <xec> nFFF: what is that supposed to do?
[09:17:53] <nFFF> grab first word of .lastbread
[09:18:18] <nFFF> replace it with a span with class of the first word
[09:18:38] <nFFF> then generate a url, and append it to the body, of an image, who's url contains the first word
[09:19:16] <nFFF> trying to create a generic way, rather than 10 identical functions, for each product name
[09:19:53] <xec> i'm a bit lost, but - what part is working? what is the issue
[09:20:21] <nFFF> xec, none works
[09:20:28] <NoiseEee> nFFF: your first issue is needing to understand why you're trying to place PHP in your javascript
[09:20:51] <NoiseEee> and needing to undertand that it's just not going to work like that.
[09:20:54] <nFFF> NoiseEee, the php returns the media url -> it's a CMS -> Magento
[09:21:08] <NoiseEee> nFFF: then pastebin your rendered browser script
[09:21:13] <NoiseEee> nFFF: not anything with PHP
[09:21:20] <NoiseEee> s/script/source
[09:21:48] <xec> valid html wouldn't hurt either
[09:22:23] <nFFF> NoiseEee, my browser isn't rendering the php
[09:22:56] <nFFF> that php returns: http://www.safeguardarmour.co.uk/skin/safeguard/default/
[09:23:08] <nFFF> thats the media URL
[09:24:39] <nFFF> maybe it's the rgex
[09:25:27] <TehRabbitt1> hey I can't seem to figure out why this is "undefined": http://jsfiddle.net/2wZW9/
[09:26:38] <Taloncor> nFFF: a.) replace only works on strings
[09:27:01] <NoiseEee> TehRabbitt1: because your selector didn't even work
[09:28:16] <TehRabbitt1> NoiseEee: what do you mean?
[09:28:27] <JAAulde> i just found out that the graphic designer here snuck a copy of wowSlider onto one our sites, and was trying to do it to a second...so pissed.
[09:28:42] <Taloncor> nFFF: Whats the purpose of the first regexp? It would only replace the first word with the first word
[09:29:16] <TehRabbitt1> JAAulde: what is wowSlider?
[09:29:30] <nFFF> Taloncor, trying to extract first word from string
[09:30:07] <JAAulde> TehRabbitt1:  an image carousel plugin which comes as as an executable you run on your computer to drag in images and it generates the markup and script. overcomplicated nonsense. costs $30
[09:30:09] <markKZ> ok got it partially working. NoiseEee the $(this).attr('name').replace('c','')+1 converts "8" to "81"
[09:30:17] <markKZ> the plus is appending the "1" and not increasing by 1
[09:30:21] <TehRabbitt1> 0_0 ah
[09:30:23] <xec> NoiseEee: http://jsperf.com/selector-vs-traversing
[09:30:26] <JAAulde> TehRabbitt1: worse, it distributes its own copy of jQ, which is out of date, and modified!
[09:30:32] <TehRabbitt1> X_X
[09:30:40] <TehRabbitt1> JAAulde: yea not cool
[09:30:44] <xec> NoiseEee: i haven't use jsperf.com before, let me know if i did something silly
[09:31:18] <NoiseEee> xec: looks about right; "selector manipulation" is the winner
[09:31:29] <JAAulde> TehRabbitt1:  Especially given the architecture I have to maintain here.  all our sites run on our core code system, which does things like compress and condense out code and loads it via LAB. he totally bypassed all that
[09:31:31] <xec> oh? i got the opposite
[09:31:32] <NoiseEee> for me in chrome that is xec
[09:31:51] <xec> i'm in firefox
[09:31:57] <nFFF> Yolu both win, it's browser dependant :)
[09:32:00] <JAAulde> TehRabbitt1: and by bypassing all that, caused 2 copies of jQ to get loaded on the page, and a race condition
[09:32:09] * JAAulde is done venting
[09:32:12] <xec> yeah, that's quite interesting
[09:32:30] <Taloncor> nFFF: Which string? in this example the "Commander" ?
[09:32:52] <TehRabbitt1> okay well here si where I feel stupid...
[09:32:52] <TehRabbitt1> http://jsfiddle.net/2wZW9/1/
[09:32:59] <TehRabbitt1> why does the first one work, but 2nd one doesnt?
[09:33:00] <markKZ> NoiseEee and parseInt() fixed this ;)
[09:33:05] <markKZ> thanks a lot.
[09:33:29] <nFFF> Taloncor, exactly., basically need the first word, as the 'commander' (or whatever first word), is the name of the product, and will be used in subsequent ocde to get right url's etc
[09:33:30] <NoiseEee> markKZ: ahh isweet
[09:33:33] <xec> NoiseEee: ha, this is strange, traversing won in my old chrome 12 but not 16 ^^
[09:33:59] <NoiseEee> TehRabbitt1: uhhhh there's no <select> element  (read: 'your selector failed')
[09:34:30] <TehRabbitt1> NoiseEee: AH X_X I wasn't paying attention... forgot that wasn't a dropdown menu
[09:34:31] <TehRabbitt1> lol
[09:34:49] <TehRabbitt1> I swear I wish I could evolve to have a built-in second set of eye ssometimes
[09:34:59] <NoiseEee> heh
[09:35:20] <TehRabbitt1> NoiseEee: Thanks :-D http://jsfiddle.net/2wZW9/2/
[09:35:21] <TehRabbitt1> lol
[09:35:29] <TehRabbitt1> (it works!)
[09:36:24] <xec> nFFF: i would do that sort of work on server side, saving it as a data- attribute
[09:36:39] <markKZ> $('input [name="c'+nextNum+'"]') this doesnt work.
[09:36:48] <Taloncor> nFFF: Starting with a correct regexp may help. http://jsfiddle.net/mydyG/2/ ;-)
[09:36:50] <xec> markKZ: remove the space after input
[09:37:26] <snagnever> hey, how do i should keep my scripts? i mean, should i have a monolytic .js with everything or it's ok to have on-page scripts?
[09:38:03] <nFFF> Taloncor thanks, gotta fly will look at home
[09:38:06] <xec> nFFF: http://jsfiddle.net/mydyG/3/
[09:38:18] <markKZ> xec http://pastebin.com/4wchVnRG
[09:38:25] <markKZ> nextNum is "12" for sure. c12 exists.
[09:38:33] <markKZ> it wont change tho.
[09:38:38] <nFFF> Taloncor yours doesn't reutnr first word
[09:38:42] <nFFF> xec thanks exactly what needed
[09:39:32] <xec> markKZ: why don't you use the solution i provided, or ask NoiseEee when using his. also; what is the $ doing in front of nextEl on line 3
[09:39:42] <Taloncor> nFFF: It alerts me with "Commander"
[09:40:15] <xec> Taloncor: did you hit update before you pasted the url?
[09:40:17] <Taloncor> nFFF: Sorry, didn't save it ;)
[09:40:18] <Taloncor> http://jsfiddle.net/mydyG/4/
[09:40:25] <Taloncor> yeah, noticed that
[09:40:43] <markKZ> xec ill be honest, this is what happens with a php coder tries to do javascripting.
[09:40:52] <markKZ> the $ ruined it. thank ><
[09:40:57] <markKZ> thanks even
[09:41:03] <xec> markKZ: yw :)
[09:41:04] <NoiseEee> xec: also for safety's sake you should replace line 1 with var nextNum = parseInt($(this).attr('name').replace('c',''),10)+1;
[09:41:14] <NoiseEee> sorry markKZ not xec
[09:41:47] <xec> NoiseEee: you gotta agree that traversing makes for prettier code at least ;)
[09:42:00] <NoiseEee> xec: heh sure :)
[09:44:08] <xec> readability improved by 76.3% according to my calculations
[09:44:26] <xec> did you know that 80% of all statistics are made up on the spot?
[09:44:30] <NoiseEee> hey, you can use line breaks or split it up a bit!
[09:44:35] <Taloncor> xec: Your calculations are of by atleast 0.739%
[09:44:41] <xec> hehe
[09:51:58] <sviatovigt> the .detach() function has come limitations when it comes to use the html() function?
[09:52:26] <sansb> is it possible to print a jquery object to console in such a way that I can manipulate it from there?
[09:52:29] <sviatovigt> I'm trying to set some content with html() function after I have used detach() and it's not working
[09:53:02] <xec> sansb: you would need to set a breakpoint
[09:53:07] <risky_s> hi, unrelated jquery question, can you changed the colors of a twitter or linkedin profile icons to match your own site?
[09:53:34] <sansb> xec, good call. thanks.
[09:54:13] <xec> sansb: actually, i'm still not sure if you would be able to manipulate it, tbh
[09:54:35] <xec> sviatovigt: what sort of limitations are you talking about?
[09:55:33] <sansb> risky_s, if they're picture files you're going to have to modify the colors by hand.
[09:56:16] <D_Roch> Hi,  Iwould like to know if it's possible to load a div from another website using JQuery, I know thats not possible with the .load() function because of crossdomain limitations but is there any way arround
[09:56:22] <risky_s> sansb, but are you allowed to do that?
[09:56:39] <D_Roch> I would like to load a website menu directly into a tumblr ;)
[09:57:43] <sansb> risky_s, good question. you'll probably have to ask the author of the icon to be totally kosher.
[09:58:24] <risky_s> sansb, cos I read on the twitter side and they said you shouldnt manipulate the colors unless necessary, and I aint really changing much
[09:59:18] <armenianeagle> How do I copy the value of a variable, assign it to a new variable, override the first variable while keeping the original variable value?
[09:59:36] <sansb> risky_s, it's your call. It sounds like they'd rather you didn't (they're trying to maintain their brand/identity) but you might get away with it.
[10:00:31] <sansb> armenianeagle, I think you want http://api.jquery.com/clone/
[10:01:14] <kaneda^> hey guys, i'm looking for jquery that allows you to take a set of strings and put them on one side of a column or the other
[10:01:23] <kaneda^> could be simple, click to select, then click to move to the other side
[10:01:32] <armenianeagle> sans - thanks! :)
[10:01:39] <armenianeagle> sansb*
[10:01:41] <swashington> Anyone have a second to help me out? I'm working with a fixed position menu that sometimes runs into the footer. I've tried a plugin but it seems overly complicated and buggy. I've got this so far: http://jsfiddle.net/CuufA/
[10:01:49] <xec> sviatovigt: i don't understand your question completely - is something like this what you're doing? http://jsfiddle.net/4NejC/
[10:02:47] <sviatovigt> xec: just a second
[10:03:22] <sviatovigt> xec: I can't load that page
[10:03:28] <sviatovigt> what I was trying to say
[10:03:45] <sviatovigt> is that I have called detach() for an element
[10:03:49] <xec> sviatovigt: jsfiddle is a bit slow at the moment, just try again
[10:04:04] <cybersholt> i keep getting 503's for fiddle
[10:04:13] <sviatovigt> and after I call the html() function but is not working
[10:04:21] <sviatovigt> xen: I'm waiting to load
[10:05:07] <kaneda^> anyone know?
[10:05:10] <kaneda^> like a jquery split pane chooser?
[10:05:47] <xec> kaneda^: i couldn't make much sense of your question... you have one column?
[10:06:10] <kaneda^> xec, you know those file choosers that allow you to move files from one side to the other with those little buttons int he middle?
[10:06:17] <kaneda^> i thought jquery might have a plugin like that
[10:06:21] <xec> oh right
[10:06:47] <tomek_> Hello - I have a stupid problem with ready, mayby you can help me. I hawe this simple page. The div welcome_page but it is not shown. Do you hav an idea why? Look at this page http://ironbone.no-ip.org/~tomek/
[10:06:56] <blindMoe> kaneda^: you could probably do that with draggable / sortable fairly easily
[10:07:19] <kaneda^> blindMoe, i'd actually prefer it be click selectable, like a masked checklist
[10:07:44] <kaneda^> meh, i'll just write it myself
[10:07:53] <blindMoe> seems fairly simple
[10:07:55] <xec> kaneda^: i don't know any plugin personally, but i can't imagine it would be too hard to make yourself
[10:07:56] <xec> yea
[10:08:01] <kaneda^> yah
[10:08:06] <kaneda^> i think it should be easy to do
[10:08:23] <kaneda^> i'll just pop a table in a modal window and put some event listeners in it
[10:08:52] <xec> do you want to be able to select multiple elements?
[10:09:17] <xec> i was thinking a simple html multiselect would be a good start
[10:09:30] <kaneda^> xec, yeh, exactly
[10:09:33] <blindMoe> or jquery ui's  .selectable()
[10:09:39] <blindMoe> http://jqueryui.com/demos/selectable/
[10:09:47] <kaneda^> thanks blindMoe
[10:10:23] <maraujop> Q: If I do an AJAX request that does one redirect. Is there a way to know in the success callback what was the final URL requested'
[10:10:25] <maraujop> Q: If I do an AJAX request that does one redirect. Is there a way to know in the success callback what was the final URL requested?
[10:10:42] <Eviltwin> maraujop: No
[10:10:45] <kaneda^> blindMoe, fairly perfect
[10:10:50] <kaneda^> ty
[10:11:08] <blindMoe> np... it works well with shift and control functionality to so you can select multiples
[10:11:08] <kaneda^> agh
[10:11:15] <kaneda^> except it's jqueryui, and i'm avoiding libs like that
[10:11:26] <kaneda^> even the custom minimized ones are bloat i dont need
[10:11:27] <maraujop> Eviltwin: so what can I do?
[10:13:39] <Eviltwin> maraujop: Live without that information
[10:15:04] <maraujop> Eviltwin: :) I will try
[10:15:29] <sviatovigt> xec: I'm looking at what is on the page you sent me
[10:15:38] <sviatovigt> can I modify the code with what I need?
[10:15:55] <xec> sviatovigt: yes, and hit update at the top to get a new url
[10:16:04] <sviatovigt> ok
[10:16:07] <sviatovigt> just a sec
[10:16:25] <swashington> Why is everyone ignoring my questions? :(
[10:18:18] <xec> swashington: the jsfiddle link isn't loading, and the question doesn't make sense without it
[10:18:41] <swashington> xec: What about it doesn't make sense? How can I make it clearer?
[10:18:51] <Taloncor> jsfiddle having some trouble :/
[10:19:05] <Taloncor> swashington: Without the code to look at the most question are hard to answer
[10:19:29] <markKZ> ok im getting desperate.
[10:19:30] <markKZ> var nextEl = $('input[name=c"'+nextNum+'"]');
[10:19:33] <markKZ> this is breaking everything
[10:19:37] <markKZ> took me 30 mins to figure that out
[10:19:52] <xec> well, it's not a question - you state you're using a overly complicated plugin, what is the issue?
[10:19:54] <swashington> xec: here's the problem I'm running into: http://dev.seanwash.com/journal Scroll all the way down and the menu slides over the footer
[10:20:15] <markKZ> what could be wrogn with this?
[10:20:18] <markKZ> if i remove this line, the rest works
[10:20:34] <markKZ> nextNum is 8, for sure
[10:20:39] <markKZ> and c8 does exist
[10:21:26] <xec> swashington: it doesn't here, but i guess i got a bigger screen. it does if i make my window smaller. what did you try to solve it?
[10:21:52] <Taloncor> markKZ: You quotationmarks are wrong. Should be $('input[name="c'+nextNum+'"]');
[10:22:03] <xec> swashington: it actually goes on top of the content as well
[10:22:28] <swashington> xec: I've tried using the Scroll to Fix plugin but it seemed really buggy. There has to be a more simple way to make it work!
[10:22:49] <sviatovigt> xec: http://jsfiddle.net/9skvc/
[10:23:14] <markKZ> is there no way to debug this kind of stuff? ffs
[10:23:23] <sviatovigt> hope the page worked and you can see the changes
[10:24:20] <sviatovigt> xec: you can also see my code here: http://tinkerbin.com/i6xtsyt2
[10:24:29] <sviatovigt> but you will not be able to text it
[10:24:34] <xec> sviatovigt: it looks like the exact same code i posted? except an id="test"
[10:24:35] <sviatovigt> *test
[10:25:02] <sviatovigt> xen: please check the last page I sent you
[10:25:24] <xec> sviatovigt: ah, i got it
[10:25:42] <sviatovigt> ok
[10:25:43] <xec> avalarion: .detach() removes from DOM, so you can't select it after.
[10:25:55] <xec> oops, sviatovigt, not avalarion
[10:26:08] <sviatovigt> ok
[10:26:11] <xec> silly nickcompleter
[10:26:21] <sviatovigt> thanks for your response
[10:26:24] <xec> sviatovigt: so what you can do, is save it in a var
[10:26:35] <sviatovigt> but if check it out
[10:27:02] <sviatovigt> you will see that I select a different element than the one I attach
[10:27:10] <sviatovigt> *I detach
[10:27:27] <xec> sviatovigt: just like i did with p = $('p').detach() then you can do p.html() later
[10:27:48] <xec> oh, sorry
[10:29:10] <sviatovigt> xec: but I remove personal-section-right and I try to put html content in block-personal-selction
[10:29:25] <xec> sviatovigt: ummm... so. what part of this works, and what doesn't
[10:29:33] <sviatovigt> it detach
[10:29:45] <sviatovigt> but it doesn't put the html content in block-personal-selction
[10:30:20] <xec> sviatovigt: is the block empty after? or does it have "test"
[10:30:33] <sviatovigt> it was a typo
[10:30:35] <sviatovigt> :((((((
[10:30:52] <sviatovigt> I lost an hour and more because of typo
[10:30:57] <sviatovigt> now it works
[10:31:07] <sviatovigt> but I get: test[object Object]
[10:31:23] <lilmikey> hi
[10:31:36] <xec> yes, that's what i would expect, form is a jqXHR
[10:31:46] <lilmikey> what are the technologies behind those two sites: http://lamoulade.com/
[10:31:47] <sviatovigt> and what can I do about it
[10:31:55] <lilmikey> http://slaveryfootprint.org/
[10:31:57] <sviatovigt> ?
[10:32:19] <lilmikey> i think thats parallax scrolling, but how is that accomplished?
[10:32:23] <xec> sviatovigt: read the docs, look at examples, see ?post
[10:32:23] <bot-t> sviatovigt, jQuery.post(url, [data], [success], [dataType]): Load data from the server using a HTTP POST request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.post/
[10:33:02] <xec> sviatovigt: see the third parameter called success? this is where you could put the function doing the .html() call
[10:34:50] <lilmikey> oh, right.
[10:35:11] <lilmikey> i know now. basically the elements positions are just modified by scrolltop
[10:37:00] <sviatovigt> xec: I have read the documentation
[10:37:06] <sviatovigt> but still I don't get it
[10:37:17] <sviatovigt> because it should make an intelligent guess by defauld
[10:37:26] <sviatovigt> if I don't specify the data type
[10:37:31] <sviatovigt> so it should be html
[10:37:42] <xec> ?ajax101 @ sviatovigt
[10:37:42] <bot-t> sviatovigt, Please reference the AJAX 101 diagram: http://i41.tinypic.com/etsbyo.png and these slides: http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide41

[10:52:23] <manisabri> I'm returning a HTTPNotFound and it goes straight to ajax success method

[10:53:25] <min|dvir|us> Hi. I want to remove all onclick attributes and execute their contents when clicked but later. How?
[10:53:35] <min|dvir|us> Can I do this from within a .click() handler?
[10:54:23] <brianfreud> manisabri, only thing I can think of is maybe you're tripping over x-domain - 127.0.0.1 vs localhost
[10:54:24] <Musok> aro: thanks, i'll search
[10:54:26] <min|dvir|us> I want to use onclick attributes like a callback.
[10:54:57] <Musok> aro: this hasnt a carousel mode
[10:55:17] <aro> carousel?
[10:55:21] <Musok> yes

[10:56:14] <Musok> http://sorgalla.com/projects/jcarousel/examples/static_simple.html kind of like this
[10:57:15] <brianfreud> manisabri, I mean, "http://127.0.0.1" being seen as a different domain from "http://localhost"
[10:59:31] <manisabri> brainfreud Tried localhost just now... same result .
[11:00:59] <manisabri> seems I have to stick to json for now ...

[11:13:41] <Giverny> api.jquery.com/hover/
[11:15:21] <iamcurio> beeviz: il give it a go
[11:15:40] <iamcurio> beeviz: does it need to be on document load?
[11:17:34] <iamcurio> this is what i am trying to do: is this correct: $('.views-field-field-feature-image a').bind('mouseover', function() { $('.views-field-body').show(); });
[11:17:56] <iamcurio> i have display none for the hidden div in my css
[11:22:01] <sviatovigt> xec?

[11:22:32] <sviatovigt> thank you
[11:22:42] <sviatovigt> I have read the documentation again
[11:22:55] <sviatovigt> and understood what was with the callback function
[11:22:58] <xec> good job :)
[11:23:04] <sviatovigt> thanks
[11:23:07] <xec> yeah, it takes some getting used to
[11:23:23] <sviatovigt> I have though a question
[11:23:25] <cody--> if im running a $.each is there something that I can do to ensure the next bit of code dosnt get executed until the .each is done?
[11:23:33] <sviatovigt> but I don't know how to explain
[11:23:49] <sviatovigt> I will try my best
[11:24:24] <sviatovigt> $("#element-id") selects the element with the id=element-id

[11:25:20] <vicentimartins> someone about error in function .eq(i) in firefox 9.0.1?
[11:25:38] <xec> sviatovigt: not following, do you have a variable containing the id, or something?

[11:26:41] <KWhat_Work> anyone know what the jquery ui dev wiki url is ?
[11:26:42] <xec> vicentimartins: excuse me, what?
[11:26:43] <vicentimartins> know about*

[11:27:29] <bot-t> vicentimartins, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[11:27:30] <vicentimartins> Do you know about errors in function .eq(i) under fireforx
[11:27:40] <xec> vicentimartins: nope
[11:27:46] <Whirl3d> can you programmatically apply focus to an invisible form element?
[11:28:09] <xec> Whirl3d: invisible as in outside viewport, yes
[11:28:22] <xec> Whirl3d: invisible as in display: none; don't think so
[11:28:36] <Whirl3d> xec, great distinction, thanks.
[11:28:50] <xec> :)
[11:28:51] <vicentimartins> xec: thnx! i try here! =D
[11:33:44] <Whirl3d> in the change event which event property tells you the option selected or do I have to filter by the new select.val()?
[11:34:11] <kawohi> love hurts, but revenge feels great :)
[11:35:31] <ravenzz> Whirl3d $(this).val()
[11:35:52] * muzone is now playing: Muzone - Dingeling (http://home.no/dwaynie/dingeling.mp3)

[11:36:07] <Whirl3d> ravenzz, doesn't that return the value? I need the option element, not the value of the select element
[11:36:36] <ravenzz> oh I see
[11:37:04] <Whirl3d> right now I use $("select").find("option").filter("[value='"+$(this).val()+"']"); but I was hoping the event object would pass the option element as a target or something
[11:38:39] <Whirl3d> the api documentation could really use a short reference section after each topic which outlined the details of the parameters received/passed to each jquery method..
[11:38:47] <Whirl3d> kind of like GoogleMaps does...
[11:39:15] <NoiseEee> Whirl3d: you could always console.log things and look yourself :)
[11:40:09] <xec> Whirl3d: e.currentTarget.options[e.currentTarget.selectedIndex]) <-- i did some digging :D
[11:40:46] <ravenzz> $(this).find(':selected') ?
[11:40:50] <Whirl3d> xec, where did you dig for that? And thanks a lot for your help. Great idea, too NoiseEee.
[11:41:14] <xec> Whirl3d: console.log(e) like NoiseEee suggested
[11:41:17] <Whirl3d> lol, ravenzz...how obvious...thanks
[11:42:03] <Whirl3d> I would have never found that xec/NoiseEee...thanks for all your help./
[11:44:16] <jeffreylevesque> can you run a click() function call within a recursive function that keeps running setTimeout() calls?
[11:44:37] <jeffreylevesque> dumb question
[11:44:47] <xec> by run you mean trigger?
[11:44:52] <xec> or bind
[11:44:53] <jeffreylevesque> ya
[11:45:05] <jeffreylevesque> i wrote a jquery slideshow code
[11:45:21] <jeffreylevesque> i have thumbnails off to the side, that if clicked, i'd like to update the main rotator
[11:45:23] <xec> yes, i don't see why not
[11:45:27] <jeffreylevesque> kk
[11:45:36] <jeffreylevesque> i got it displaying alert();
[11:45:42] <jeffreylevesque> so just found it you can
[11:47:03] <someprimetime> jeffreylevesque: post the code
[11:48:00] <jeffreylevesque> someprimetime: http://jsfiddle.net/YpW3a/8/
[11:48:50] <blindMoe> what is the best way to switch this to a .live() statement?  $('img.mdc-is-dc.mdc-size-full').mdcWatermark({ watermarkImg: '/wp-content/plugins/mdc/images/badge_dc.png' });
[11:48:51] <jeffreylevesque> Im working on 'function thumbnail ()'
[11:48:55] <Whirl3d> is there an easy way to check the options of a select object to determine if a "value" existst before trying to set $("select").val(missingoption)?
[11:49:01] <blindMoe> it works great on page load but not after ajax items are added
[11:49:10] <someprimetime> you're building a slideshow?
[11:49:15] <jeffreylevesque> someprimetime:should be located on the far bottom of the .js source code
[11:49:19] <jeffreylevesque> unfortunately yaa
[11:49:29] <jeffreylevesque> almost done
[11:49:48] <LordThumper> I am trying to dynamically set the 'height' in FancyBox
[11:50:05] <LordThumper> 'height': function () { return (x * 0.8) } is not working for some reason
[11:50:50] <LordThumper> height CSS is getting function () {return (x*0.8) } instead of the calculated value
[11:51:24] <LordThumper> Should I add eval() ?
[11:52:38] <LordThumper> Or I might be doing something wrong
[11:53:03] <Taloncor> LordThumper: Provide code pls
[11:53:50] <LordThumper> http://jsfiddle.net/Thumper/Wqsmw/
[11:54:11] <LordThumper> I will create a working demo if necessary
[11:55:59] <kaneda^> blindMoe, i think i'm just about done
[11:56:06] <blindMoe> nice
[11:56:19] <blindMoe> are you using two .selectables()  ?
[11:56:23] <blindMoe> should be pretty easy with two
[11:57:24] <Taloncor> LordThumper: Just tried it with dialog() instead of fancybox and that works just fine
[11:57:58] <LordThumper> Ah must be a fancybox issue then, thanks alot
[11:58:01] <Taloncor> LordThumper: Therefore i see no reason why it shouldn't work with fancybox
[11:58:22] <Taloncor> But should the arguments be calculate before they are passed to the plugin?
[11:58:23] <sviatovigt> xec: can you please check this: http://tinkerbin.com/st3z5AX7
[11:58:36] <sviatovigt> this is my previous question with some explanations
[11:59:01] <LordThumper> Taloncor: What do you mean?
[12:00:01] <Taloncor> LordThumper: I think that using FancyBox should not change anything. The passed arguments should be calculate correctly no matter if you are using fancybox or anything else
[12:00:14] <LordThumper> Yes I understand that
[12:00:16] <LordThumper> This is strange
[12:00:46] <LordThumper> It is like fancybox is grabbing what is behind the height:
[12:00:57] <LordThumper> And forcing it with $(element).css()
[12:01:18] <LordThumper> did an eval(function() { }) and it is behaving exactly the same
[12:01:26] <LordThumper> I must be doing something wrong
[12:02:07] <zmbmartin> Anyone that can point to me why this doesn't work. --> https://gist.github.com/1642216 The spinner show on blur, but does not hide on complete, but the checkmark shows on complete?
[12:05:20] <sphinxxx> strange indeed
[12:05:40] <sailboat> would someone who's used Html.ActionLink help me with this code, http://pastebin.com/rCdxcKGq
[12:06:31] <sailboat> I am stuck trying to decide what to use.  I want to make the ActionLinks buttons
[12:06:41] <sphinxxx> zmbmartin, you should probably put semicolons after each line
[12:07:05] <sphinxxx> on the retrurnVal =   lines
[12:08:06] <jeffreylevesque> someprimetime: sorry I got disconnected.  if you're busy, no biggie, i'll find some help sometime in the next few days.  should be almost done with this, just have to work on 'function thumbnail () {}
[12:08:52] <zmbmartin> sphinxxx: ok, if I do .hide() it doesn't work but .remove() removes the element from the page so sort of works. But I want to hide it.
[12:11:28] <sphinxxx> zmbmartin, is there anyway you could create a jsfiddle, or show a working example
[12:12:03] <cgiGeek> .
[12:12:27] <Turjakas> I've got a problem with multiple sequential jQuery.html("blah") calls: how can I assured that previous .html() calls actually get rendered before the next, so that I can refer to the elements created by the previous call?
[12:13:14] <Taloncor> LordThumper: I am unable to set the width/height at all with fancybox
[12:13:44] <sphinxxx> Turjakas, you should probably avoid chaining .html anyway
[12:13:56] <Turjakas> more specifically, I want to do this: $("#elem1").html("<div id='elem2'></div>"); and then $("#elem2").html("content");, but the second call does not work, because the first one has not finished
[12:13:59] <sphinxxx> you should do everything in a variable and then use .html just once
[12:14:13] <ajpiano> Turjakas: it's considerably wiser to not query the dom for things you just had access to in the first place
[12:14:32] <ajpiano> $("<div id='elem2'></div>").appendTo("#elem1").html("content")
[12:14:42] <sphinxxx> yea what he said
[12:15:18] <tesmar> when I try to submit two forms in one action, only the last one submits, anyone know of a workaround?
[12:15:57] <Turjakas> ok. I wasn't clear enough. The first call is rendering a JavaScript template using mustache, and in the second call I need to refer to an element in the rendered template to activate a jPlayer audio player. The page will have multiple audio players.
[12:16:08] <cgiGeek> so sorry and very offtopic I seem to have a localized outgage can anyone load http://manage.cdnpop.com
[12:16:16] <Turjakas> so how should I render the template so that I could refer to elements in it
[12:16:17] <sphinxxx> tesmar, code?
[12:16:47] <ajpiano> Turjakas: the same principle applies
[12:17:05] <Eviltwin> Turjakas doesn't have any principles!
[12:17:08] <ajpiano> $( template({some: "data"}) ).find(".something").html(".foo")
[12:17:36] <Taloncor> LordThumper: Are u trying to set width/height for images?
[12:17:45] <blindMoe> is there a method to get an elements real size ( height / width ) with padding and margins included?
[12:17:55] <Turjakas> yes, I know, I'm a jQuery novice, so I don't have principles :)
[12:18:52] <blindMoe> ahhh .outerHeight(true)
[12:18:53] <blindMoe> nice
[12:21:13] <jeffreylevesque> I'm a jQuery beginner lol

[12:24:17] <evren_> hi, i need to check a code for parantheses, i am not a programmer, is there a parantheses validator tool for checking a code
[12:24:27] <Bish> Are google bots able to parse pages who use alot of ajax, ae load method
[12:25:51] <JAAulde> evren_: I don't really know what you mean, but try http://www.jshint.com/ or http://www.jslint.com/
[12:25:54] <bobbobbins> hey, im building a for lack of a better term, timeline calendar...dates are listed at the bottom, then events for each day stack on top of those...im wondering if anyone has a suggestion of the best way to implement it, it needs to be scrollable into the future and into the past...so im wondering if i should find a calendar module and tweak it, or what, i had trouble finding something similar
[12:26:35] <bobbobbins> Bish: yes, as long as the data is there on page load, anything that is ajaxed in later probably won't get spidered
[12:27:03] <felipe_Brz> would someone please tell me whether they see anything wrong here?? there's no exception thrown... I just get 'undefined' printed on the screen !!! this is driving me crazy! http://pastie.org/3215329
[12:27:31] <evren_>  http://pastebin.com/R0y3DZij   I just want to delete header-dictionary-match("spoof-domains","from", 1 from code but i couldnt figure out which paranthese to delete
[12:27:35] <ajpiano> felipe_Brz: ajax is asynchronous, as i'm sure you're aware
[12:27:39] <Bish> :(
[12:27:52] <ajpiano> evren_: we can only help with jQuery issues here
[12:28:12] <JAAulde> felipe_Brz: for one, since you used getJSON, you don't need to parse your data...jQuery does that before giving it tot oyu
[12:28:16] <ajpiano> evren_: try using a text editor that allows you to visually see matching parens and other paired delimeters
[12:28:37] <JAAulde> lol, and ajpiano is right--I hadn't seen that line down thyere
[12:30:15] <felipe_Brz> oh....
[12:30:19] <WiGGz> whats up guys
[12:30:31] <jeffreylevesque> has anyone written a jquery slideshow?
[12:30:44] <WiGGz> you can find them online
[12:30:46] <WiGGz> google it
[12:30:53] <JAAulde> ajpiano: using the UI widget factory, I was hoping to be able to validate that an element was proper for the widget (in create) and if not, call Widget.prototype.destroy.call on it. It seems that calling destroy from create doesn't have any effect, which is understandable. Is there a way to do this, or should I give up on caring about element validation?
[12:30:55] <felipe_Brz> so javascript leaves the function before the callback has been completed....
[12:30:56] <jeffreylevesque> i have one almost complete
[12:30:59] <felipe_Brz> correct?
[12:31:08] <JAAulde> felipe_Brz: yes
[12:31:16] <jeffreylevesque> working on the thumbnails tho, click it, and it updates the main rotator
[12:31:20] <WiGGz> what kind of element are you trying to validate
[12:31:23] <WiGGz> ?
[12:31:35] <ajpiano> JAAulde: what are you trying to "validate" about the element - that it's an input or something?
[12:31:42] <ajpiano> or *isn't* an input or something?
[12:31:44] <felipe_Brz> oh... makes total sense... thanks JAAulde , ajpiano
[12:32:01] <JAAulde> ajpiano: yes, that sort of thing...
[12:32:56] <ajpiano> felipe_Brz: yes, see ?101
[12:32:57] <bot-t> felipe_Brz, New to JavaScript? You should read this first: http://eloquentjavascript.net/contents.html
[12:33:04] <ajpiano> i mean see ?ajax101
[12:33:04] <bot-t> Please reference the AJAX 101 diagram: http://i41.tinypic.com/etsbyo.png and these slides: http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide41
[12:33:20] <Whirl3d> anybody got any advice on styling select option elements?
[12:33:27] <ajpiano> JAAulde: my gut instinct is that it's overkill
[12:33:37] <JAAulde> ajpiano: ok, I'm cool with that
[12:33:54] <JAAulde> things are working as is, and I do tend to overdo this sort of thing ;)
[12:33:57] <ajpiano> JAAulde: have you set defaultElement on the widget's prototype?
[12:34:06] <JAAulde> ajpiano: I have not
[12:34:15] <ajpiano> JAAulde: is the widget meant for internal use?
[12:34:31] <ajpiano> on yr app/at yr firm, etc?
[12:34:35] <JAAulde> ajpiano: yes, mostly, althoguh I'd like to see it released
[12:34:51] <JAAulde> ajpiano: but for the forseeable future, yes, internal use
[12:34:56] <ajpiano> yeah, my intsinct about that kinda thing is like... the damn thing should break if you try to use it on the wrong type of element
[12:35:08] <JAAulde> right, I can see that.
[12:35:21] <ajpiano> writing code to make it "work" when "ur doin it wrong" will just leave you with crufty code and even harder to debug cases when people are "doin it rong"
[12:35:42] <avandenhoven> I need a reality check. For some reason, on this site: http://www.whistlerquestion.com the event delegation isn't working. If you paste the code in this gist (https://gist.github.com/1642415) in to a browser console you see the messages from the click() method, but not delegate(). I can't figure out what the problem is.
[12:35:53] <JAAulde> I'm almost embarrassed to admt it, but in this case I want a widget run on window and window only.  It's a widget which does what BREAKPOINTS.JS does, only it's not a pile of poo
[12:36:12] <ajpiano> hmm
[12:36:24] <JAAulde> but I def know what you're saying and think it makes sense
[12:36:33] <ajpiano> i'm not even sure that makes sense as "a widget" per se
[12:37:11] <ajpiano> JAAulde: if you want to restrict it to window, i'd have the widget you created, and then instantiate it once and only expose access to the instantiated singleton to users
[12:37:48] <JAAulde> ajpiano:  yeah, i probably overuse widget.
[12:40:44] <jstout24> if i have a json array and need to call something like, json_array.$(this).attr('data-type');
[12:40:46] <jstout24> how can i do that?
[12:41:29] <jstout24> nvm, dumb
[12:41:33] <jstout24> json_array[...]
[12:42:46] <avandenhoven> does it make sense that $('body').delegate('.foo', 'click', function(){}); does not work but  $('body').delegate( 'click','.foo', function(){});
[12:43:09] <siguy> hi
[12:44:13] <someprimetime> avandenhoven: $(elements).delegate(selector, events, data, handler);  // jQuery 1.4.3+
[12:44:13] <someprimetime> $(elements).on(events, selector, data, handler);        // jQuery 1.7+
[12:44:19] <someprimetime> use on()
[12:45:22] <avandenhoven> someprimetime: I know that. I'm using 1.4.3 and on my site delegate only seems to work by switching the selector and events arguments.
[12:45:31] <avandenhoven> http://www.whistlerquestion.com/
[12:45:42] <iamcurio> is there a way to change this piece of code so that it looks for the div above rather than the next div http://pastebin.com/SVkjxpu6
[12:46:59] <dabear_> ?prev @ iamcurio
[12:46:59] <bot-t> iamcurio, .prev([selector]): Get the immediately preceding sibling of each element in the set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/prev/
[12:47:05] <siguy> I'm trying to filter a table by the selected item(s) in 2 select boxes. http://jsfiddle.net/FV5Cc/1/
[12:47:21] <ajpiano> avandenhoven: do you by any chance have the valdiation plugin installed?
[12:47:33] <avandenhoven> avandenhoven: probably, yes.
[12:47:34] <siguy> I've got an array for each select box, but I'm getting stuck on how to filter the table
[12:47:39] <iamcurio> bot-t: sweet
[12:47:40] <bot-t> apparently http://sweet.nodns4.us/
[12:48:04] <ajpiano> avandenhoven: the validation plugin had its own, custom .delegate() implementation from before delegate was added to jQuery core
[12:48:11] <ajpiano> and it had a differnt signature than the official method
[12:48:16] <someprimetime> avandenhoven: there you go
[12:48:19] <someprimetime> it's conflicting
[12:48:42] <someprimetime> nice detective work ajpiano
[12:49:02] <avandenhoven> <cursing />Thanks ajpiano and someprimetime for your help
[12:52:06] <siguy> I believe what I have to do is iterate through each array and filter the results based on that but I'm a bit stumped as to the correct way to do that
[12:52:51] <Eviltwin> siguy: Sorry, missed the qustion
[12:54:23] <siguy> I've got 2 (multiple) select elements and I am trying to filter a table based on what is selected: http://jsfiddle.net/FV5Cc/2/
[12:54:52] <AliG1000> Hi - can I limit the number of times a character can be typed into a textarea? I want to specifically limit the number of times a hash-tag (#) can be entered (for use on Twitter)
[12:54:55] <siguy> or display everything if - Any - is selected for both
[12:56:26] <AliG1000> @siguy - something like this?  http://www.plus2net.com/php_tutorial/ajax_drop_down_list.php
[12:57:27] <siguy> something kind of like that yeah
[12:58:13] <siguy> there is that table which is going to be full of a bunch of different jobs with predefined locations and positions.
[12:58:53] <siguy> I need to be able to select only certain positions or only certain locations or certain positions and certain locations
[12:59:04] <AliG1000> or another way of thinking about my question, how do I count the number of times a particular character has been typed?
[13:00:13] <ajpiano> AliG1000: use an object as a hash table
[13:00:39] <ajpiano> and update it on keyup, would be one way
[13:00:53] <ajpiano> but that wouldn't necessarily be accurate cause it wouldn't track deletions very well
[13:01:06] <siguy> so I'm thinking something like a $('tr').each() that checks the contents of the tr against each array.. Am I on the right track here?
[13:01:15] <ajpiano> would just leave you knowing how many times they pressed backspace :p
[13:01:22] <Eviltwin> siguy: Yes
[13:02:23] <AliG1000> @ajpiano - thank you - new to hash tables.  Would something like this be useful? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1953078/how-to-really-limit-the-available-character-for-an-input-field-using-jquery
[13:03:02] <ajpiano> marginally, i can probably cook up a demo, give me a few minutes
[13:03:19] <AliG1000> 1st. count the number of times it has been emptied, if that has been reached, then limit any more (on keypress)
[13:03:22] <AliG1000> cook away :)
[13:03:56] <NoiseEee> AliG1000: you should ask yourself if you really want this as a live, as-it-happens-on-keypress thing or after the field has its final value
[13:04:26] <andrew9183> ive been put in charge to hire a javascript developer for our company.  how much a 3 year javascript veteran scripter cost.. hmmm ?
[13:04:30] <AliG1000> @NoiseEee - live, preferably - it's more user-friendly
[13:04:40] <NoiseEee> AliG1000: but is it?  :)
[13:05:57] <NoiseEee> andrew9183: that sort of thing varies on where the job is located, etc etc
[13:06:12] <AliG1000> @NoiseEee - I think so - otherwise the user has to go back and edit - or we need to remove the last #'s they entered.  On keypress is probably the best solution
[13:06:58] <AliG1000> @siguy - can a user select multiple items in one select box? or just one?
[13:07:54] <andrew9183> lets say, in a small town :)
[13:10:20] <siguy> AliG1000: A user can select multiple items yeah.
[13:10:26] <AliG1000>  siguy: can you use: $('#someElement').find('option:selected');
[13:11:26] <NoiseEee> $('#multiSelect').val() //will return all selected <options> in an array
[13:11:39] <NoiseEee> siguy: ^^
[13:12:13] <siguy> so what you're saying is that I don't need the || [];
[13:12:32] <NoiseEee> yep
[13:12:59] <siguy> cool thanks
[13:13:26] <siguy> will $('#someElement').find('option:selected'); work on an array?
[13:14:05] <Eviltwin> Will it "work on an array"?
[13:14:11] <Eviltwin> What does that mean
[13:14:21] <andrew9183> hi evil :)
[13:14:31] <jeffreylevesque> anyone willing to look at my rotator.js?
[13:15:05] <andrew9183> what does it do jeffrey ?
[13:15:13] <siguy> Eviltwin: what happens if the select box has more than 1 item selected?
[13:15:14] <NoiseEee> siguy: if you're looking to get a value from a form element, use .val
[13:16:33] <jeffreylevesque> andrew9183:  Currently, the rotator cycles through images in a <li> and upon mouseover, clearTimeout() stops the rotation, on mouseout(), the rotation resumes setTimeout()
[13:16:39] <ajpiano> AliG1000: http://jsfiddle.net/eeQQf/
[13:17:00] <AliG1000> :) ajpiano - looking now
[13:17:10] <kaneda^> oof, blindMoe it didn't like being fed table names, so i've hard coded them
[13:17:10] <kaneda^> it works now
[13:18:03] <jeffreylevesque> andrew9183:  the above works.  I'm building a thumbnail component.  Each rotating image, has a thumbnail, that when clicked updates the main slideshow.  I feel like it should be easy -- just define .click() that when thumbnail is clicked then update the rotator image and reset my 'setTimeout()'s
[13:19:17] <wizoz> Hi. If I got a event-listener, t ex $('table tr').bind('click', function () { ... }); - How can I also apply that event-listener to new elements being added in the table, example $('table').append('<tr><td></td></tr>'); ?
[13:19:59] <NoiseEee> wizoz: what version jquery
[13:20:03] <AliG1000> @ ajpiano - perfect  - although I defeated by using copy and paste
[13:20:12] <wizoz> NoiseEee: 1.7.1
[13:20:33] <ajpiano> AliG1000: you'd have to write some code to strip out additional # on the fly in that case
[13:20:39] <NoiseEee> wizoz: $('table').on('click','tr',function() { //only fires on <tr> elements, added whenever }
[13:20:49] <ajpiano> and then you end up having to make judgment calls
[13:20:51] <ajpiano> in your js
[13:21:11] <ajpiano> which is probably why NoiseEee's suggestion to just do this validation on submit instead of as they type makes more sense
[13:21:16] <zatan> Hi I am receiving json like this: ["year", {"2011": ["Jan"], "2012": ["Feb"]}]      how can I loop throgh every element ? for examples : 2011: Jan , 2012: Feb ?
[13:21:37] <wizoz> NoiseEee: Thank you for that. I know this is unrellated to jQuery and javascript, but how do you also apply the stylesheets?
[13:21:54] <NoiseEee> wizoz: what do you mean?
[13:22:11] <Eviltwin> zatan: see ?.each
[13:22:11] <bot-t> zatan, .each(function): Iterate over a jQuery object, executing a function for each matched element. http://api.jquery.com/each/
[13:22:29] <AliG1000> ajpiano nice work  :)  I'll maybe monitor to see if people are getting around it - and yes I can strip it out after submission. thank you so much.  studying the code now :)
[13:22:33] <Eviltwin> This one actually: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.each/
[13:22:37] <Eviltwin> Or for(var k in object)
[13:22:50] <zatan> Eviltwin, bot-t  thanks i will look at that
[13:23:01] <JAAulde> bot-t is the best
[13:23:08] <ajpiano> AliG1000: why are you restricting the number of hashtags someone uses?
[13:23:34] <wizoz> NoiseEee: Same thing. If I have this css rule in the .css-file: table tr { background-color: red; } - How can I make elements added to table also to get that stylesheet?For some reason, it's not being styled.
[13:23:39] <wizoz> You understand?
[13:23:56] <NoiseEee> wizoz: i do, but that seems odd, they should be picking up the style
[13:24:03] <NoiseEee> wizoz: maybe recreate a jsdfiddle if you can
[13:24:26] <wizoz> NoiseEee: I might be making a typo.
[13:24:32] <wizoz> Let me check before.
[13:24:39] <wizoz> Thanks so much so far :)
[13:24:45] <NoiseEee> np good luck
[13:24:49] <AliG1000> ajpiano we're using it for Twitter but we also want to extract keywords - we just didn't want a user to overload it with hash tags in an effort to get it noticed
[13:25:31] <ajpiano> AliG1000: ah, getting into #compupolitics
[13:25:35] <AliG1000> ajpiano and to stay in some control on what is posted (as it will be posted on our own Twitter stream)
[13:25:38] <ajpiano> http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=3712
[13:25:39] <AliG1000> yup
[13:26:25] <wizoz> NoiseEee: Typo. Thanks again.
[13:26:34] <ajpiano> AliG1000: sounds good ... regardless of what you end up with, i'm sure the technique to count the chars by frequency will end up being useful :)
[13:26:56] <AliG1000> ajpiano  "Justin and his Bieberettes" :)
[13:27:11] <NoiseEee> ajpiano: if i call $(el).empty()  to clear out all the children of el, should I be removing event listeners on the children first or does jquery do that for me?
[13:27:23] <ajpiano> jquery will clear off listeners when you do .empty()
[13:27:26] <NoiseEee> thanks
[13:27:35] <AliG1000> ajpiano thank you - will be putting this into the form now!
[13:30:23] <aro> is there a way to abort a jquery ajax request
[13:30:33] <Eviltwin> Same way you abort normal AJAX

[13:56:30] <eric357> I'm stuck and need some advice - I have 8 checkboxes & I need to validate that at least one is checked.
[13:57:10] <eric357> They are all input type="checkbox"  name="race[]"
[13:58:07] <eric357> how can I select them in jquery and then iterate over them ( using .val()?) to see if at least one is checked?
[13:59:03] <eric357> i tried $('input[name[]="race"]') but that throws a big error :-(
[13:59:45] <eric357> just plain $('input[name="race"]') misses them entirely.

[14:03:35] <Alex82> i got a JS array of objects and i need to pass it directly to datatables
[14:03:38] <Alex82> any clue?
[14:07:15] <Jon47> Alex82 there's no canonical answer to your question
[14:08:04] <Jon47> it depends probably a lot on your database, but JSON is a good choice for serializing data in javascript

[14:10:35] <dougb> $fn.sortable() isn't working for ajax loaded HTML, is there a way to make it work for ajax loaded html? something along the lines of $(".sortable").on().sortable() ?
[14:13:29] <NoiseEee> dougb: pretty sure you'd have to re-initialize it when new content is loaded
[14:15:00] <dougb> ok, i figured i'd have to do that.  for some reason i'm running into an issue where a checkbox won't work if I don't sort something on the list first, which is very odd. I'm using $fn.on() for it
[14:16:35] <sarspazam> anyone able to define what a handler is?
[14:16:42] <sarspazam> is it just another term for an event

[14:22:46] <sviatovigt>  $("#first-name").click( function() is not working
[14:22:51] <sviatovigt> this my my problem
[14:22:59] <sviatovigt> I click and nothing happens
[14:23:04] <sviatovigt> and I have no error
[14:27:09] <sviatovigt> someprimetime: can you help me?
[14:28:40] <supsup> is using "body" for a delegate's selector considered bad mojo due to heavy dom parse or does it not matter?
[14:29:56] <NoiseEee> supsup: if its really the only common parent, or you really *do* need to listen on the entire thing, do it
[14:30:58] <supsup> it's the only common parent currently, i could rewrite it not to be, just did not know if there was a performance cost involved
[14:31:16] <Sean-Der> How can I escape a space in Javascript?
[14:31:24] <Sean-Der> $('#quoteFormEdge/ 1Table > tbody:last').append(data)
[14:31:33] <Zzaichik> .trim()
[14:33:25] <Sean-Der> trim removes whitespace from the beginning of a string it seems
[14:33:42] <Sean-Der> I have run into a situation where users are putting spaces into the middle of strings
[14:34:04] <Sean-Der> I should have planned for it earlier, but now I am playing catchup
[14:34:20] <Sean-Der> This strings are the names of elements so now I have tables names that have a space in them
[14:36:11] <sviatovigt> someprimetime: did you read the explanation?
[14:39:24] <xxiao> a newbie question, why is jqueryUI still released against very old jquery?
[14:39:57] <xxiao> i see, jqueryUI 1.8.17 is for jquery 1.3.2+, did not notice that + sign
[14:40:20] <Sean-Der> Is there no way around my situation. I can write an exception for what is happening it just seems like I should be able to escape spaces....
[14:41:14] <Patabugen> Sean-Der can't you fix the problem for future names and manually fix the old, bad names?
[14:41:14] <sviatovigt> can someone please help a little bit?
[14:41:18] <sviatovigt> please...
[14:41:38] <Patabugen> sviatovigt what's your problem? I joined afterwards
[14:42:31] <Sean-Der> Patabugen, yes I just update my database to include underscores or hyphens. Oh well it was worth asking hahah I learned for next time at least
[14:44:01] <Patabugen> I presume you're talking about HTML id or classes?
[14:44:15] <Patabugen> For which spaces (as far as I'm aware) are not valid, so it's natural that jQuey wouldn't try and make them usable
[14:44:45] <Sean-Der> ID, my tables name are generated from names in a DB, I just didn't plan ahead for it well enough. I will just have to fix it though
[14:45:46] <minijupe> how do I attach a function to an element?
[14:46:03] <Patabugen> Yeah, I'd suggest it's best to fix it now than to write an exception for it and have to deal with that later
[14:46:11] <Patabugen> minijupe you can use $.data()
[14:46:20] <pifantastic> ?ask @ sviatovigt
[14:46:21] <bot-t> sviatovigt, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[14:46:35] <minijupe> pifantastic: to attach function
[14:46:36] <minijupe> ?
[14:46:57] <pifantastic> minijupe: you mean for an event?
[14:47:08] <pifantastic> or you just want to associate the two?
[14:47:23] <pifantastic> minijupe: Patabugen is right, you can use .data()
[14:47:26] <pifantastic> ?data @ minijupe
[14:47:27] <bot-t> minijupe, .data(key, value): Store arbitrary data associated with the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/data/
[14:47:46] <minijupe> pifantastic: it's kindof like namespacing I guess, I want to attach certain functions to certain things, and then call an elements my_action() method
[14:48:11] <minijupe> pifantastic: so the value would be an anonymous func?
[14:48:23] <pifantastic> minijupe: perhaps you want to look into jqueryUI's widget factory
[14:48:48] <pifantastic> it's how they do things like, $('#foo').dialog('open'), $('#foo').dialog('show'), etc..
[14:49:32] <sviatovigt> Pataburgen: can you please check this: http://jsfiddle.net/9skvc/6/
[14:49:33] <sviatovigt> ?
[14:49:35] <Patabugen> minijupe that sounds like a good use for a plugin methinks
[14:49:57] <minijupe> pifantastic: here's what I'm doing, maybe you have a recommendation. I'm faking an ajax file submission. The form submits to a hidden iframe (I know...), and when the iframe get's updated, i want it to trigger certain functionality in the parent window.
[14:50:00] <pifantastic> minijupe: but yeah, you can do $('#foo').data('my_action', function() { alert('hi!'); }) and then $('#foo').data('my_action')();
[14:50:02] <hays> anybody use datatables.net
[14:50:40] <minijupe> pifantastic: can I use data() with live() ?
[14:50:57] <minijupe> the elements that this will get bound to come and go via ajax...
[14:51:14] <pifantastic> minijupe: nope
[14:52:51] <Patabugen> sviatovigt what do you mean it doesn't work? Of course the Ajax doesn't work since the script doesn't exist on jsfiddle.net
[14:53:05] <minijupe> pifantastic: so when the user clicks 'upload another image', a form is loaded via ajax, and I want that form to then get some methods via UJS.
[14:53:44] <minijupe> pifantastic: can you tell I don't do JS very often? I think I need to go stab myself in the face with a fork for a moment.
[14:53:44] <pifantastic> minijupe: sorry man, I have to head out
[14:53:50] <nFFF> jQuery(this).replaceWith('<span class="sprite'+me1+'"'></span>'); <---- this breaks all jscript on the page
[14:53:52] <pifantastic> :P
[14:53:56] <nFFF> why is my questin
[14:54:07] <pifantastic> minijupe: there are libs that already do multiple file uploads with iframes, maybe look at the source of those?
[14:54:15] <nFFF> me1 is a string that returns 'Commander'
[14:54:31] <Patabugen> nFFF and what's 'this'?
[14:54:48] <nFFF> within .each(){function(){
[14:54:48] <minijupe> pifantastic: tnx already did. maybe i'll implement that, but right now this has to be done by tomorrow and I'm %90 done.
[14:55:09] <pifantastic> nFFF: you have an extra '
[14:55:38] <nFFF> where abouts?
[14:55:39] <pifantastic> nFFF: http://grimhappy.com/i/0e7c392.png
[14:56:09] <nFFF> which one?
[14:56:10] <pifantastic> me1+'"' <-------
[14:56:12] <pifantastic> that one
[14:56:17] <tw2113> anyone know of some Apple "Coverflow" style plugins? Looking for some suggestions to check out. Sorry for the slightly generic question :D
[14:56:23] <nFFF> how do I put a " character there than?
[14:56:41] <nFFF> it needs to render "spritecommander"
[14:56:45] <pifantastic> nFF jQuery(this).replaceWith('<span class="sprite'+me1+'"></span>');
[14:57:25] <nFFF> thanks pifantastic works
[14:57:35] <nFFF> shit now I see why
[14:57:41] <nFFF> man thats a stupid mistake
[14:58:48] <GoGoGarrett> I'm writing a form, and i'm making a link that show's a hidden div with the fields of name, last name.  I want the "add_new" button to clone that hidden div each time and add an unique "name" each time it's clicked, or if there an easier way - what would that be?
[15:00:00] <supsup> how do u handle the data?  the names are static for the random amount of people u adD?
[15:00:15] <supsup> input name='person1'...etc
[15:00:24] <GoGoGarrett> well it's a registeration form, and they have a primary applicatent, and then thye're just adding the names of others attention
[15:00:39] <supsup> u said they can hit it infinate times
[15:00:42] <GoGoGarrett> so I want there to be an unique identifier to post that to a database on the next page
[15:00:45] <supsup> so how do u deal on server all these extra inputs
[15:00:58] <GoGoGarrett> I can limit it to 5 or 10 I suppose
[15:01:10] <sviatovigt> Patabugen: it doesn't anything
[15:01:11] <GoGoGarrett> but i'm posting it to a page that will inject it into a database and send the request to authorize.net
[15:01:35] <Patabugen> sviatovigt it's sending the ajax request for me
[15:01:39] <nFFF> Anywhere to convert a string to lowercase?
[15:02:08] <supsup> lots of ways, prob my way is bad but i would make an array with names of names.  then when they hit the add i'd have a html template that fills in the name from the array and deletes it from the array so it can't be used again
[15:02:22] <supsup> then add html template to dom
[15:03:13] <kaneda^> blindMoe, it's working beautifully now
[15:03:25] <blindMoe> awesome
[15:03:28] <blindMoe> have an example online?
[15:03:48] <blindMoe> you could easily combine it with .sortable as well and have it save via ajax
[15:03:51] <supsup> i'd just make a simple case first: adding 1 input type say Name  over and over to meet array length
[15:04:01] <kaneda^> blindMoe, it's behind a private registration atm
[15:04:06] <blindMoe> k
[15:04:29] <kaneda^> blindMoe, i can send you an invite code if you'd like
[15:04:37] <supsup> if array of names is empty -- add button disapears
[15:04:40] <kaneda^> PM your email if you want a code
[15:06:30] <nFFF> where's the beef with this: me = me.toLowerCase();
[15:07:21] <sehh> hey people

[15:12:58] <TomB___> I have a very specific query.  I'm trying to get the textual information from the results of a Google Map public transit search, into a modal box when I click a button.  See the results on this long link:  http://maps.google.com/maps?saddr=Burbank+Blvd&daddr=N+San+Gabriel+Blvd&hl=en&ll=34.110099,-118.24791&spn=0.346225,0.617294&sll=34.118058,-118.243103&sspn=0.346192,0.617294&geocode=FfZsCQIdfkfx-A%3BFW5zCAIdzBL2-A&vpsrc=0&dirflg=r&

[15:15:11] <TomB___> I'm thinking that I may be able to do it with Greasemonkey - but the result text does not appear in the HTML of the page itself - so I'm a little stuck
[15:15:12] <supsup> exec returns array
[15:15:28] <sviatovigt> can someone please help with this: http://jsfiddle.net/9skvc/7/
[15:15:35] <sviatovigt> I can't get it work
[15:18:31] <TomB___> @ sviatovigt  what would you like it to do?
[15:19:56] <sviatovigt> first of all to see that when I click on the input with the id=first-name something happens
[15:21:04] <sviatovigt> I have something to say first
[15:21:14] <Zzaichik> sviatovigt:  it works for me… I click in the input field and here appears below it.
[15:21:24] <sviatovigt> yes I know it does
[15:21:34] <sviatovigt> but I have something to say first
[15:21:50] <Zzaichik> haha okay..
[15:22:15] <nicholasschulz> If I want do unset a variable in JS, do I type "delete someVar;" ?
[15:22:24] <sviatovigt> the div with the id block-personal-section-form it is loaded inside the page after clicking the link edit through an ajax request
[15:23:07] <sviatovigt> so the div with the id block-personal-section-form doesn't actually exist on the page, put it is loaded from an external file
[15:23:42] <GoGoGarrett> http://pastebin.com/aGF2sZvY  any one see why this wouldn't be working correctly?  It doesn't seem that my coutner is incrementing
[15:23:49] <sviatovigt> @ Zzaichik: you can see that in the $('#edit-personal').click(function()
[15:26:12] <Zzaichik> okay
[15:28:26] <supsup> nicholasschulz just assign it undefined i think
[15:28:34] <Zzaichik> yeah I'm not following you
[15:28:41] <supsup> ? delegate @ sviatovigt
[15:28:41] <bot-t> sviatovigt, .delegate(selector, eventType, handler): Attach a handler to one or more events for all elements that match the selector, now or in the future, based on a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[15:30:57] <sviatovigt> supsup: thank you
[15:31:11] <sviatovigt> but why isn't working with the code I have written?
[15:31:49] <supsup> your code has php blocks in it that u need to fix. we just want pure html
[15:31:52] <coldhead> bugs probably
[15:32:00] <supsup> you need to document your code where it's failing
[15:32:13] <supsup> if possible making a simple case example
[15:32:22] <supsup> well u did that so sec
[15:32:23] <supsup> ~~
[15:33:08] <supsup> can you make example without php code in it
[15:33:20] <sviatovigt> I'm trying now
[15:35:56] <supsup> also confused since the example works where you say it does not.
[15:36:18] <supsup> if it's because the id does not exist when document.ready happens then u need to add delegate like i said
[15:37:42] <EasyCo07> Hey guys, quick question. Given the code here: http://jsfiddle.net/WTtPS/
[15:38:30] <EasyCo07> Actually hang on
[15:38:37] <EasyCo07> That's the wrong one :p
[15:38:48] <coldhead> >: |
[15:38:58] <robrobbins> hey, i have a series of <ul>s that i want to be scrollable horizontally, should i use something like jcarousel for that, or is there something better?
[15:39:09] <sviatovigt> supsup: here is the code modified
[15:39:18] <EasyCo07> http://jsfiddle.net/WTtPS/1/
[15:39:25] <sviatovigt> I think now I understand why it isn't working
[15:39:36] <sviatovigt> given your explanation above
[15:39:47] <EasyCo07> $(this) always refers to the first occurrence of .upper_right
[15:39:53] <EasyCo07> or say .lower_left
[15:40:01] <robrobbins> i know jcarousel is good for images and stuff, but these are just lists, so im not sure what to use
[15:40:05] <supsup> robrobbins: lots of choices heres one: http://www.richardscarrott.co.uk/assets/javascript/jquery/ui-carousel/demo/
[15:40:11] <sviatovigt> the problem is that none of the elements that are not on the page before I hit edit will not work
[15:40:38] <robrobbins> supsup: that'll probably work perfect, thanks
[15:40:38] <sviatovigt> and with delegate... things are gettin' complicated
[15:40:48] <supsup> shit just got real
[15:40:49] <sviatovigt> can I do it some other way?
[15:41:06] <supsup> never saw your code update link so not sure what u talkin about sviatovigt
[15:41:18] <sviatovigt> sorry
[15:41:21] <sviatovigt> here it is: http://jsfiddle.net/9skvc/8/
[15:41:33] <coldhead> no EasyCo07, it should refer to the actual element being hovered over
[15:41:34] <EasyCo07> Essentially the hover class is only ever applied on the first div box and never the second
[15:41:41] <supsup> so u have code example but you say it does not work yet it does
[15:41:45] <supsup> when i click the input
[15:42:06] <EasyCo07> That's what I thought but the log is not agreeing 
[15:42:27] <sviatovigt> yes, indeed it works, but that input doesn't exist on my page unless I click edit
[15:42:49] <sviatovigt> and will appear after it will be loaded from an external file
[15:43:15] <sviatovigt> but I think you are right, it is not working because it doesn't exist on the page
[15:43:32] <sviatovigt> unfortunatelly, this will complicate things
[15:43:38] <supsup> sviatovigt: http://jsfiddle.net/9DT6d/
[15:43:39] <sviatovigt> if I will have to use delegate
[15:45:51] <coldhead> EasyCo07: http://jsfiddle.net/WTtPS/3/
[15:46:00] <coldhead> it works there when you don't use area maps
[15:46:14] <coldhead> i haven't used those since the 80s
[15:46:26] <coldhead> but i suspect either your markup is broken or maps are deeply weird
[15:46:31] <EasyCo07> Yah believe me, I hate maps
[15:46:40] <EasyCo07> I'm just not sure how to approach it otherwise
[15:46:51] <coldhead> do they maybe need unique names?
[15:46:52] <EasyCo07> I need to create a box and then split the box diagonally
[15:47:08] <supsup> having the luxury of using core jquery functions is not complicated ~~ delegate makes things less complicated imo.  otherwise u have these scary ajax nested monsters or other similar crazies pretty sure it was added to make it less complicated.
[15:47:25] <coldhead> i suspect giving them the same name makes them part of the same map
[15:47:29] <EasyCo07> So when you hover over one diagonal alive of the box it triggers highlights that triangle
[15:47:33] <coldhead> so it's as though they had a common parent
[15:47:37] <sviatovigt> supsup: thank you
[15:47:59] <EasyCo07> coldhead, yah so it seems
[15:48:08] <coldhead> EasyCo07: the jQuery way would be to bind to the entire image and inspect the position of the mouse to work out which area it's in
[15:48:24] <coldhead> rather than write markup that makes you want to vomit
[15:48:28] <EasyCo07> cold head, I might give that a go
[15:48:35] <coldhead> good luck EasyCo07 !
[15:48:37] <EasyCo07> Haha, couldn't agree more
[15:48:55] <EasyCo07> Cheers for the insight & help.
[15:49:05] <coldhead> EasyCo07: http://docs.jquery.com/Tutorials:Mouse_Position
[15:49:05] <sansb> I'm modifying a list of elements with $.each(). Is it possible to do this asyncronously?
[15:49:09] <coldhead> might be some assistance
[15:49:39] <EasyCo07> Thanks
[15:49:46] <coldhead> quite welcome!
[15:50:36] <ringotwo> sansb, you have a large array to process?
[15:51:11] <sansb> ringotwo, yes. I have about 1000 elements in a <ul> and I want to hide certain <li>s depending on if their contents match some criteria
[15:51:23] <sansb> Problem is that the UI locks up while this runs.
[15:52:20] <supsup> sansb run profiler and find out which function is taking all the time and then try to optimize allt he code there
[15:52:22] <ringotwo> so you're adding a class to each <li>, how are you hiding them?
[15:52:43] <sansb> $.hide()
[15:53:44] <supsup> make jsfiddle example also ~
[15:54:03] <ringotwo> would be better to render them correctly in memory before putting it in the dom
[15:54:08] <LordThumper> sansb: You can put the elements in memory instead of the DOM, modify there, then create dom
[15:54:17] <ringotwo> jinx
[15:54:23] <LordThumper> lol
[15:55:50] <sansb> All right, I'll try something like that. Thanks.
[15:56:19] <ringotwo> or... you could add a spinner to the list
[15:56:19] <ringotwo> that's the lazy route
[15:56:33] <sansb> heh, not bad.
[15:57:25] <sansb> I kinda screwed myself here- this hiding had been done with AJAX but I thought it would be faster and more straightforward if I did it in the DOM. It's not actually slower but it locks the UI.
[15:58:56] <ringotwo> you could break it up into 100-row chunks or smoething
[15:58:56] <ringotwo> setInterval, 10 steps
[15:59:25] <nicholasschulz> stupid question: is this right?: if ($(this).val() != "") { $(this).val("Some Value"); }
[15:59:57] <ringotwo> yes
[16:00:07] <nicholasschulz> Thanks
[16:01:33] <nicholasschulz> How do I get the standard value of an element? I have a textfield with a standard value, if clicked the value is blank, then if blur and the value is still blank I want it to set the standard value..
[16:02:10] <sansb> ringotwo, that might help a lot. is there a built-in way of doing something like that or am I going to have to keep track of my state manually
[16:03:18] <ringotwo> manually
[16:03:34] <ringotwo> but you should post your code, i don't really understand how 1000 rows would lock up the UI
[16:03:42] <ringotwo> you might be able to just do some optimization
[16:03:48] <sansb> ok
[16:03:51] <Zzaichik> nicholasschulz: The way you put that up just barely should almost do the trick.  if value is empty on blur, then assign a value.
[16:04:04] <nicholasschulz> http://jsfiddle.net/nicholasschulz/92BvQ/

[16:05:09] <Zzaichik> stdValue is never being given a default value
[16:05:35] <supsup> scope monster has struck

[16:06:49] <nicholasschulz> zzaichik yes it is in the focus
[16:06:49] <ringotwo> yikes
[16:07:02] <Zzaichik> No it's not
[16:07:15] <supsup> thats local to that scope.
[16:07:40] <ringotwo> ok, lemme look
[16:07:44] <nicholasschulz> zzaichick hmm.. how do I give a def. value then?
[16:08:13] <ringotwo> so you have two each()s
[16:08:15] <Zzaichik> nicholasschulz: http://jsfiddle.net/92BvQ/2/
[16:08:40] <Zzaichik> Oh, and you were trying to assign a value if the value was NOT empty
[16:08:41] <ringotwo> is the top one necessary?
[16:08:50] <sansb> ringtwo, right, but they wouldn't both run. first each is followed by a return.
[16:09:04] <ringotwo> you don't have to show() if it's already in the dom, right?
[16:09:21] <ringotwo> that would increase performance right away
[16:09:27] <ringotwo> you only need to worry about hiding
[16:09:37] <ringotwo> i would just shit-can the first each()
[16:09:41] <nicholasschulz> zzaichik take a look at line 3 in the JS. Doesn't that catch the default value and set stdValue=defVal?
[16:09:48] <sansb> no I have to show all the ones that I hid if the user unselects all of the client/location checkboxes.
[16:10:05] <ringotwo> remove any display: none off the <li>
[16:10:05] <ringotwo> right?
[16:10:10] <ringotwo> ohh
[16:10:38] <nicholasschulz> zzaichik Before I empty the value I assign the value to stdValue  -> Then stdValue can print that as the value when blur
[16:11:28] <ringotwo> the condition is pretty complex
[16:11:55] <ringotwo> inArray() the way you have it is pretty inefficient
[16:11:59] <Zzaichik> nicholasschulz:  okay, so if that's what you want than what you have should do the trick. You'd just have to make stdValue a global variable
[16:11:59] <sansb> from a profile it looks like show and hide are each taking a lot of time
[16:12:05] <ringotwo> wait, nm
[16:12:25] <nicholasschulz> zzaichik how do I make it global?
[16:13:03] <Zzaichik> nicholasschulz:  hang on a sec - afk
[16:13:06] <nicholasschulz> zzaichik I need to do it like I am because Im using the same script on multiple variables, so I can't have a static value
[16:13:07] <nicholasschulz> ok
[16:13:40] <supsup> nicholasschulz: http://jsfiddle.net/92BvQ/3/
[16:14:18] <supsup> o wait
[16:14:22] <nicholasschulz> supsup: thanks
[16:14:25] <supsup> heh that also does what they type tho
[16:14:32] <nicholasschulz> that worked fine
[16:14:35] <nicholasschulz> yes ;-)
[16:14:40] <supsup> naw type in the boxes
[16:14:43] <supsup> then move out
[16:14:48] <ringotwo> i'm not familiar with 'callback = '
[16:14:59] <supsup> prob not what u want
[16:15:09] <sviatovigt> supsup
[16:15:16] <supsup> sup
[16:15:21] <sviatovigt> can you please help me just a little bit?
[16:15:33] <supsup> maybe i gotta roll out this mug tho to eat soon
[16:15:34] <sansb> ringotwo, that was an attempt to make this async but it's just like passing the function as the only argument
[16:15:38] <supsup> and play with groovy
[16:15:50] <supsup> what is your question
[16:16:29] <ringotwo> well one thing that would help is to descend from #id instead of 'input'
[16:16:52] <ringotwo> if you aren't using callback, that probably slows things down a bit
[16:17:24] <sviatovigt> supsup: the question is here: http://jsfiddle.net/9skvc/9/
[16:17:27] <ringotwo> the conditions are complicated, but i dont' see any way around that
[16:17:32] <supsup> nicholasschulz u can make function that first sets the data values when page loads before u add focus/blur events or u could just add a extra param to tag to use as defults
[16:17:33] <sviatovigt> it's about using delegate
[16:17:55] <supsup> ? .on
[16:17:56] <bot-t> supsup, .on() - Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[16:18:06] <supsup> version added: 1.7
[16:18:06] <ringotwo> you could push all the li's to an array and then do one [array].show()
[16:18:20] <ringotwo> at the very end
[16:18:24] <sviatovigt> it is putted as a comment inside the function validateFirstName
[16:18:37] <nicholasschulz> supsup: You're jsfiddle did exactly what I needed it to do :-)
[16:18:52] <supsup> $("#first-name-msg").length > 0
[16:18:58] <ringotwo> i think the trick is to do it all in memory
[16:19:06] <supsup> or ==
[16:19:08] <supsup> ===
[16:19:22] <ringotwo> even if it's already in the DOM, just read it all into memory, do all the operations, drop the original node, and insert the updated node
[16:19:30] <sansb> ringotwo, I'll try that.
[16:19:39] <ringotwo> that would be the best thing
[16:19:54] <sviatovigt> yes but #first-name-msg doesn't exist on $(document).ready
[16:19:58] <supsup> sviatovigt ur saying when first-name is added to dom, first-name-msg is not also added to dom?
[16:20:07] <ringotwo> could be a problem if you have behaviors attached
[16:20:07] <ringotwo> but you could do a clone(true)
[16:20:07] <supsup> it's added at same time no?
[16:20:27] <sviatovigt> yes, it is added at the same time
[16:20:40] <supsup> then it should exist
[16:20:43] <supsup> i think ur doing ur if wrong
[16:20:45] <supsup> use .length
[16:21:08] <nicholasschulz> supsup: http://jsfiddle.net/nicholasschulz/92BvQ/5/ when you enter something, then blur, then focus again -> The entered text disappears (is set to new stdValue) … any fix for this?
[16:21:11] <supsup> also ur assuming error?
[16:21:30] <sviatovigt> what about error?
[16:22:03] <supsup> nicholasschulz u would need to check if the current data is the default. if it is not then don't do $(this).val('');
[16:22:29] <nicholasschulz> ok
[16:22:54] <supsup> do console.logs use debugger
[16:22:57] <supsup> to see how far your getting
[16:22:59] <supsup> in your js
[16:23:07] <supsup> here i'll update it
[16:24:28] <supsup> sviatovigt:  http://jsfiddle.net/9skvc/10/  -- use as example to debug
[16:24:34] <supsup> use Chrome Dev tools or Firebug
[16:24:36] <supsup> to see console log
[16:24:39] <supsup> and walk through code
[16:25:07] <supsup> i can't see what your post is doing
[16:25:14] <supsup> so impossibel to debug returned results.
[16:25:53] <sviatovigt> your help is fantastic
[16:25:55] <sviatovigt> thank you
[16:26:14] <supsup> the pros are just not here tonight to tell me i'm wrong.
[16:26:17] <someprimetime> hey supsup
[16:26:26] <supsup> sorry gotta roll out. ~~
[16:26:29] <someprimetime> your help is fantastic
[16:26:31] <sviatovigt> :)))
[16:26:32] <supsup> time for food then groovy
[16:26:37] <someprimetime> word same
[16:26:38] <someprimetime> peace
[16:27:00] <sviatovigt> he did helped me a lot
[16:28:22] <atxq_> how can I tab inside a textarea?
[16:29:00] <jaequery> whats the best way to check if an input text box has changed its values?
[16:30:07] <atxq_> $("input").change(function(){});
[16:34:30] <wookiehangover> ?yehuda
[16:34:30] <bot-t> http://dl.dropbox.com/u/4431744/yehuda.png
[16:39:39] <jaequery> atxq, it only triggers after i leave the textbox
[16:44:54] <persei> ok, so I've got a div autorefreshing using jquery - how do I keep the page from scrolling up each time it does?
[16:45:04] <persei> it resets the scroll position it seems
[16:58:48] <robrobbins> hey, im not sure if this is more a css or jquery problem...i want my lists to be aligned to the bottom of the div...and they were until i applied the carousel, but i guess that messes it up, can someone help me? i can't figure out what to change here: http://50.56.58.32/stractegize/calendar.html
[16:59:04] <robrobbins> hold up
[16:59:27] <robrobbins> ok, link is good now
[16:59:42] <dmsuperman> I have a node. I need to clone it, once for each record in my ajax response. Sometimes the number of records might be 1000. What's the best way to go about doing this and keep performance good?
[16:59:54] <dmsuperman> I can't just generate the HTML because the node's layout may change
[17:00:10] <jstout24> I have event `load` binded to an iframe (on same domain, always)... basially, i don't want to trigger tha event everytime a user is navigating from within the iframe itself (ie, clicking links, submitting forms, etc)
[17:00:42] <dmsuperman> they're all going one after another into the same node, is there an easy way to append them all at once? right now I'm using $.append.apply($('thenode'), array_of_nodes) but I figure that's not best
[17:00:46] <dmsuperman> can I do it without apply?
[17:04:58] <minijupe> how can I disable a form after submit?
[17:05:21] <minijupe> I'm submitting to an iframe.
[17:06:10] <robrobbins> $("#yourform").on('submit', function(){ $(this).attr('disabled','disabled''); }); i think
[17:06:24] <robrobbins> one less '' on the right there
[17:07:44] <robrobbins> i have two problems with this i could use help on: http://50.56.58.32/stractegize/calendar.html 1. getting the everything aligned at the bottom, and 2. making it stop cutting off on the right sometimes
[17:08:08] <minijupe> robrobbins: I've done this, in fact here is my code, which hurts my eyes. http://pastie.org/3216653
[17:08:38] <minijupe> robrobbins: the issue is that at least in chrome disabling the form in the submit function sends empty data
[17:09:39] <robrobbins> why don't you just disable the submit button
[17:10:12] <minijupe> robrobbins: thought about it, but they can still type in the text fields and hit enter.
[17:10:17] <ohcibi> [OT] anyone else in here sharing this feeling like 'wooooohooooo' when using coffeescript? just want to mention it 8-))
[17:13:21] <robrobbins> hmm, i dunno then, im not so good with jquery
[17:13:33] <danheberden> ohcibi no just the sadness in my heart when i hear people using it
[17:14:01] <ohcibi> danheberden: why sadness?
[17:14:09] <danheberden> ohcibi i don't like it :)
[17:14:32] <Eviltwin> ohcibi: CoffeeScript limits JavaScript, it doens't enhance it
[17:14:42] <someprimetime> coffeescript is retarded
[17:14:52] <someprimetime> learn javascript instead of another abstraction level on top of it
[17:14:53] <danheberden> and there you have it
[17:14:54] <ohcibi> lol, k... didnt expect that
[17:15:00] <danheberden> ohcibi haha
[17:15:06] <ohcibi> danheberden: 8-)
[17:15:09] <donCams> coffeescript.. ugh
[17:15:21] <donCams> nah jk. i don't even know what it is
[17:15:33] <danheberden> to each their own, just be sure to know javascript in and out and THEN use coffeescript
[17:15:42] <danheberden> otherwise you'll be like the crazies in here that only know jquery selectors and methods
[17:15:45] <Eviltwin> donCams: It's a language that compiles into JavaScript...nuff said
[17:15:47] <danheberden> without knowing javascript
[17:16:26] <donCams> danheberden, so is it bad that I learned jQuery first before pure javascript?
[17:16:38] <Eviltwin> donCams: Yes
[17:16:41] <ohcibi> danheberden: ok i would have expect people learning the basis of it (like you should know what assembler is and why other programming languages compile to it)... but if you can assure that: its just nice!
[17:16:43] <danheberden> donCams did you learn javascript?
[17:17:01] <Eviltwin> ?hard @ donCams
[17:17:02] <bot-t> donCams, var z = "foo"; function x(y) { return this[y](z); } var w = x.apply(document, ["getElementById"]);
[17:17:08] <danheberden> ohcibi i can see where the niceness comes from - i really like ruby, which seems quite similar
[17:17:08] <Eviltwin> What happens there?
[17:17:11] <Eviltwin> What is w set to?
[17:17:52] <ohcibi> danheberden: thats what i mean... _of course_ you have to know what js is and what it is doing before using coffeescript... but i thought i could expect that in here 8-))
[17:18:44] <danheberden> ohcibi yeah, jquery makes things easy so people kinda skip that part sometimes - so we just help them along the path to knowledge
[17:18:52] <ohcibi> donCams: its not bad, its better to know the language the framework bases on.. but this is another discussion... coffeescript is no framework
[17:18:59] <someprimetime> hey how come when i click on an option from the arrow, it doesn't hide $('.options') http://jsfiddle.net/someprimetime/DHMGD/4/
[17:19:09] <donCams> fck what is .apply
[17:19:09] <someprimetime> but if i do $(this).parent().hide(), it'll hide the ul
[17:19:29] <ohcibi> danheberden: exactly... its the same point with frameworks, you should of course know the basis.. but if you know it.. its a relief
[17:19:30] <Eviltwin> donCams: This is why you need to understand advanced JavaScript
[17:19:55] <danheberden> Eviltwin lol if i ever saw that code in production javascript....
[17:19:59] <Eviltwin> donCams: Read through this in detail: http://bonsaiden.github.com/JavaScript-Garden/
[17:20:13] <donCams> i'm just in basics :\
[17:20:28] <donCams> thanks for the link Eviltwin
[17:20:31] <Eviltwin> danheberden: You wouldn't ever use that exact code in production but you would likely use more than one of the concepts involved
[17:20:39] <danheberden> donCams it doesn't matter how, just that you _do_ :D
[17:20:58] <danheberden> Eviltwin is there a jquery plugin for it?
[17:21:18] <Eviltwin> danheberden: Do you even know what that does?
[17:21:22] <donCams> wait. i'll try to solve that problem. i just need to know what .apply does
[17:21:51] <Eviltwin> donCams: It's explained on that page
[17:22:22] <danheberden> Eviltwin the part where the context of the function `this` is set to document and the array passed into apply becomes arguments thus the first, getElementById, is referenced on `this` (document`) as a function to call with argument z (foo), thus returning null because that element doesn't exist?
[17:22:23] <danheberden> no
[17:22:25] <danheberden> i do not
[17:22:43] <danheberden> JAVASCRIPT HACKERY
[17:23:15] <danheberden> ?eval (new Array(10)).join('NOU! ')
[17:23:17] <bot-t> danheberden: "NOU! NOU! NOU! NOU! NOU! NOU! NOU! NOU! NOU! "
[17:24:22] <donCams> danheberden, i'm tempted to use the same code, replace 10 by 1000 and replace NOU! with NYAN!
[17:24:42] <danheberden> donCams but then i'd have to ban you
[17:24:46] <danheberden> and that would be a bad thing
[17:24:50] <danheberden> i like you, you should stay!
[17:25:02] <donCams> that is why i didn't
[17:25:31] <danheberden> donCams when you're done with the apply script
[17:25:33] <danheberden> you can learn what this does
[17:25:34] <danheberden> ?lol
[17:25:34] <bot-t> function _(l){return l+(_+l)[11-((_._=(_._?_._:!_)+1)%(1+1)?!1:1+1+1+1+1)]}_(_(_('')))
[17:26:05] <someprimetime> brainfuck
[17:26:12] <donCams> wtf
[17:26:55] <ohcibi> danheberden: but really.. crazies that only know jquery selectors and methods come frome everywhere... theres no need for such thing like coffeescript to have them... so... 8-)) thats a typical problem with frameworks that has nothing to do with abstracting languages 8-))
[17:27:24] <someprimetime> http://jsfiddle.net/someprimetime/DHMGD/6/ how can i get $('.options') to hide() once the text is inserted in the placeholder
[17:27:38] <donCams> i use jQuery selectors to make my life easier. :\
[17:27:55] <Eviltwin> someprimetime: Try adding jQuery Lint maybe
[17:27:57] <Eviltwin> See what happens
[17:28:07] <someprimetime> Your JS code is valid.
[17:28:18] <someprimetime> B)
[17:28:39] <someprimetime> oh
[17:28:39] <danheberden> someprimetime think about what's going on there
[17:28:42] <someprimetime> jquery lint
[17:28:44] <someprimetime> not jslint
[17:28:49] <Eviltwin> Yes
[17:28:53] <danheberden> you click on .options to hide it, right?
[17:29:00] <danheberden> someprimetime ^
[17:29:13] <someprimetime> danheberden: do i need to hide it on the callback?
[17:29:21] <someprimetime> of the click event
[17:29:32] <danheberden> someprimetime walk through with me
[17:29:39] <danheberden> if you're hiding it when you click an option
[17:29:44] <someprimetime> and i have no idea wtf jquery lint just did after clicking that option in jsfiddle
[17:29:48] <danheberden> and you show it when you click #arrow
[17:29:58] <danheberden> what do you think is happenning when you click on .options
[17:30:01] <danheberden> or an li
[17:30:03] <danheberden> inside of it
[17:30:07] <someprimetime> it's triggering the show again
[17:30:11] <someprimetime> so it's always being shown
[17:30:13] <danheberden> exactly
[17:30:15] <someprimetime> thanks
[17:30:16] <danheberden> because the event is bubbling
[17:30:33] <danheberden> you can event.stopPropagation() in your li click
[17:30:46] <danheberden> so that it stops bubbling up
[17:30:59] <someprimetime> crap
[17:31:00] <someprimetime> thanks man
[17:31:04] <someprimetime> http://jsfiddle.net/someprimetime/DHMGD/7/
[17:31:07] <danheberden> asuming your click event is like .on('click', function(event){ or whatevs
[17:31:07] <someprimetime> B0
[17:31:08] <someprimetime> B)
[17:31:23] <someprimetime> right, it'll be with bind('click' as we haven't upgraded to 1.7 yet
[17:31:25] <someprimetime> but thanks man
[17:31:39] <danheberden> now start caching some of those objects like $('.options') as variables you only get once
[17:31:46] <danheberden> and you'll be on teh path to enlightment!
[17:31:50] <someprimetime> right, yeah this was just way quickly done haha
[17:31:51] <danheberden> *enlightenment event
[17:31:51] <someprimetime> but absolutely
[17:31:54] <someprimetime> appreciate it
[17:37:30] <donCams> i just saved both problems and gonna solve them later after work
[17:39:23] <EasyCo07> Given the following code: http://jsfiddle.net/JM6JC/4/

[17:42:43] <xp_prg> hi all, trying to figure out how to sort a table by a certain column
[17:44:08] <robrobbins> can someone please help me get these columns flush bottom? some jquery carousel function im calling is adding a float to them that messes them up, but if i remove the float, they're messed up too: http://50.56.58.32/stractegize/calendar.html
[17:47:02] <Whirl3d> what is the jquery method for detatching an element from the dom (but keeping its reference to be appended later)?
[17:47:48] <Whirl3d> I swear I searched for detach a minute ago and it couldn't find it.
[17:47:52] <Eviltwin> .remove() removes the elements and unbinds all the event listeners and kills all the data
[17:48:04] <Eviltwin> .detach() removes the elements but leaves all the event listeners and data
[17:51:08] <Whirl3d> Isn't there an easy way to sort a list of elements by their text properties?
[17:52:00] <Eviltwin> $($(".options").get().sort(function(a,b) { /* return -, 0, + to compare a and b */}))
[17:52:09] <ohcibi> okay, googled it, good to know that people are just whining about coffeescript... thought there were several issues with using it 8-))
[17:53:36] <Whirl3d> aha! I see that now. Eviltwin, you would just cringe if you ever had to look at my code. I go about everything the really hard way. Thanks again for your help.
[17:53:53] <Eviltwin> That sorts the collection, it doesn't move the elements
[17:54:02] <Eviltwin> If you want to move the elements, that's another ball of wax
[17:55:02] <erichynds> sort() is on jquery's prototype - you can just do $(".options").sort(fn)
[17:55:08] <heshanh> un jqui tabs how do i set the defualt tab to be open
[17:55:35] <gnarf> Eviltwin: .sort(fn).append( parent );
[17:55:36] <Eviltwin> Ah, so it is
[17:55:36] <gnarf> :)
[17:55:53] <gnarf> as far as actually sorting them in the dom
[17:55:54] <Eviltwin> gnarf: That's if they're all children of the same parent
[17:55:57] <Eviltwin> And if they're all of the children
[17:55:58] <gnarf> yeah
[17:56:11] <Eviltwin> I have code lying around that doesn't care what the structure is
[17:56:16] <xp_prg> Eviltwin I need to move the objects too :(
[17:56:28] <Eviltwin> Hell, they can even be parents of each other
[17:56:36] <xp_prg> do you recommend a plugin for this?
[17:57:10] <erichynds> xp_prg: http://james.padolsey.com/javascript/sorting-elements-with-jquery/
[17:59:53] <xp_prg> I have this: $('#mytableid tr').slice(4).html(); but i want to get the td:eq(1) to sort on
[18:00:09] <xp_prg> just out of curiousity, how to get the contents of td:eq(1) from my slice?
[18:00:23] <Eviltwin> ?
[18:00:27] <Eviltwin> see ?.eq
[18:00:27] <bot-t> .eq(index): Reduce the set of matched elements to the one at the specified index. http://api.jquery.com/eq/
[18:00:36] <minijupe> I've got some links coming in from ajax that need lightbox functionality:   <a href="..." class="lightbox"><img src='...'></a>, but the UJS isn't getting triggered. Any way to do this?
[18:01:04] <xp_prg> can eq do a range though?

[18:04:57] <Whirl3d> is anybody familiar with jsfiddle? I keep getting this error: 2Unsafe JavaScript attempt to access frame with URL http://jsfiddle.net/jaseinatl/3AFEB/76/ from frame with URL http://jsfiddle.net/jaseinatl/3AFEB/76/. Domains, protocols and ports must match.
[18:05:24] <Whirl3d> it looks like the same domain, protocol, and port...
[18:07:11] <xp_prg> what is #lt and #gt ?
[18:08:28] <cgsawtell> Hi all, does anyone know how I can get the content of an <a> tag, like I want to have <a class="clicker">Content</a> and when you click on it it returns "Content"

[18:19:11] <xp_prg> ok, weird question, can't I just hide all the rows, sort the rows, then append the sorted rows?
[18:26:40] <abjorn> http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/javascript-ajax/from-jquery-to-javascript-a-reference/ <- should be required reading for this channel.
[18:28:58] <xp_prg> abjorn can you help me with my table sorting problem?
[18:29:55] <abjorn> NOPE long day at work fixing peoples problems, im not gonna come home to fix other peoples problems for free. No offense, just not the day for it
[18:30:05] <xp_prg> ok np
[18:32:19] <ngharo> abjorn: did you ever read Ted the caver creepy story?
[18:32:58] <ngharo> abjorn: http://www.angelfire.com/trek/caver/
[18:34:52] <abjorn> this isn't one of those things where im reading a story then suddenly something pops out on the screen, is it?
[18:34:54] <abjorn> if so ill hurt you
[18:35:23] <someprimetime> angelfire still exists?
[18:35:50] <ngharo> lol yeah surprisingly
[18:36:10] <ngharo> abjorn: its long but entertaining
[18:36:10] <xp_prg> ok, I learned how to move a row!
[18:36:23] <xp_prg> trObj.insertBefore(trObj.prev());
[18:36:40] <xp_prg> I think I can implement bubble sort now but that is a terrible way to do it
[18:43:30] <GoGoGarrett> http://jsfiddle.net/NnuTq/1/  Any idea how I can get the attribute values to be updated to the counter var that is being incremeted
[18:44:29] <GoGoGarrett> I'm trying to change the input name to example "first_name1" "first_name2" etc.
[18:46:31] <techouse> wait, so let me get this straight, jquery's :nth-child selector is not like the css :nth-child selector but just counts ALL the children of a parent element and then uses some absolute value of which one it is?
[18:46:42] <techouse> that's odd...
[18:48:38] <xp_prg> if I have a table and I want all rows from 3 onward and the text in the second column, what is the jquery selector to get it?
[18:54:17] <wiwillia> Hi - does .prev() work for an element of a different type?  I'm clicking on a checkbox, and want to target the previous input[type=text]?
[18:59:55] <bonhoffer> $('#' + id).is(":checked") <-- this is supposed to work in the latest jquery, right?
[19:00:18] <bonhoffer> Uncaught TypeError: Object #<HTMLInputElement> has no method 'is' <-- what i get
[19:01:58] <xp_prg> hi all I have this: var trs = $('table#my_table_id tr');
[19:02:12] <xp_prg> I then try to do this: $.each(trs, function(tr) { console.log(tr.html());});
[19:02:22] <xp_prg> gives error that tr has no function html()
[19:02:55] <xp_prg> what am I doing wrong?
[19:03:22] <bonhoffer> i am trying to get a checkbox to show a text area and mark it as required when clicked
[19:07:04] <xp_prg> ok starting to understand it :>
[19:20:42] <xp_prg> I figured it out thanks all who helped ;>
[19:33:34] <abjorn> ngharo: dude.
[19:33:38] <abjorn> I just finished reading that.
[19:33:46] <abjorn> the unfinished ending thing
[19:33:47] <abjorn> god damn
[19:38:48] <oojacoboo> anyone had issues with jquery when submitting a form and it POSTing NULL arrays?
[19:39:12] <oojacoboo> I've changed from using serialize() to serializeArray() and having better results, but still getting some mis-fires...
[19:39:18] <oojacoboo> I don't understand the inconsistency
[19:39:31] <oojacoboo> 1/10 or so fails
[19:43:09] <xp_prg> are nested $.each's allowed?
[19:43:12] <takkun1946> i've been using it just fine. are you posting it to php
[19:44:57] <takkun1946> refresh_screen
[19:44:57] <takkun1946> sorry
[19:47:03] <takkun1946> i'm having trouble with creating 2 $.ajax calls and having them fire (mostly) simultaneous
[19:48:59] <takkun1946> $([0,1]).each(function() { var cnt = this; $.ajax({ url: 'foo.php', type: 'POST', data: $(form).serialize()+'&styp='+cnt, dataType: 'json', success: function(data) { console.log(data); } });
[19:51:14] <techouse> why the extra var?
[19:51:25] <techouse> and what's the 2nd ajax?
[19:53:29] <takkun1946> because I will use it later
[20:01:19] <techouse> if i were you i'd explicitly define an empty var outside your each and then inside you each assign it a value
[20:02:38] <takkun1946> true
[20:02:42] <takkun1946> will try that
[20:03:44] <techouse> or maybe out of security reasons even define it a type
[20:04:43] <Zmanu> hello
[20:15:03] <Zmanu> i get <button id="appel_base" class="menu"> and i write $("#appel_base").click(function() { alert("here"); }); and when i click i have nothing, i have only one id="appel_base" thanks for help
[20:16:14] <Zmanu> i have a css3 in which one i have animation, can it be the problem ?
[20:22:56] <Zmanu> is idle your life ?
[20:24:33] <blaggs> Hey I've got a problem with the .siblings selector in ie8. Mysetup looks like <div><div id="clickable"></div><ul display="none"></ul></div>     and I'm selecting the clickable div and attempting to select the ul, I'm just using .next() on the clickable div and when I watch ie8 looks like it is getting the DispHTMLULList Element, but I can't call .removeCLass on it. Any ideas?
[20:27:24] <takkun1946> just an fyi, the issue was using the cnt var in my success handler
[20:27:48] <Whirl3d> ? paste @ blaggs
[20:27:49] <bot-t> blaggs, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[20:28:22] <Zmanu> nobody care about my problem ?
[20:28:54] <takkun1946> @Zmanu, sorry I kept jumping in and out of the channel due to some "visual issues" with irssi app.
[20:28:57] <takkun1946> so I missed it
[20:29:16] <Zmanu> i get <button id="appel_base" class="menu"> and i write $("#appel_base").click(function() { alert("here"); }); and when i click i have nothing, i have only one id="appel_base" thanks for help
[20:29:33] * Whirl3d having idle for my life
[20:29:34] <Zmanu> takkun1946: this is my problem, i don't understand because it's a simple peace of code
[20:31:33] <takkun1946> is there a reason you're using a <button> element?
[20:31:45] <takkun1946> shouldn't it be <input type="button" />
[20:33:52] <Zmanu> in html5 button exist, and i learn html5 css3 and jquery
[20:34:01] <blaggs> Ok here is the relevant section of code, sorry all thanks for the help: http://jsfiddle.net/h4xQB/
[20:37:21] <takkun1946> @Zmanu, do you get an error in your inspector?
[20:37:26] <takkun1946> something like Uncaught TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'read'
[20:38:40] <takkun1946> errr
[20:38:41] <takkun1946> sorry
[20:38:45] <takkun1946> the read was my fault
[20:38:46] <takkun1946> ignore that
[20:39:14] <Zmanu> takkun1946: no errors in firebug
[20:39:24] <Zmanu> http://pastebin.com/VFrakmtt <= html
[20:39:26] <Zmanu> http://pastebin.com/VWL214KW <== css
[20:39:28] <takkun1946> ic, so you're using ff
[20:39:28] <Zmanu> http://pastebin.com/HZEamtX1 <== jquery
[20:39:33] <takkun1946> i'm using chrome
[20:39:35] <takkun1946> will try
[20:41:22] <takkun1946> your click function is on the #menu_base, not the button
[20:41:38] <Zmanu> takkun1946: i forget $(document).ready(function() {
[20:41:50] <takkun1946> and that
[20:43:11] <blaggs> Sorry, updated the code to have relevant css... http://jsfiddle.net/h4xQB/3/
[20:44:37] <takkun1946> also, your click event is still on the parent div
[20:44:39] <takkun1946> of which has no style
[20:44:47] <takkun1946> so clicking on the button should still produce nothing
[20:44:56] <oojacoboo> anyone ever had issues when serializing a form with multiple arrays
[20:45:17] <takkun1946> since the parent div isn't styled and doesn't "live" in the same place as your button
[20:45:21] <oojacoboo> I am sometimes getting a NULL array and it's sporadic too, which is the strange part
[20:45:40] <Zmanu> takkun1946: i change and put it on button so #appel_base but nothing better for animate but alert is ok now
[20:45:54] <takkun1946> k
[20:45:54] <takkun1946> :D
[21:01:28] <xp_prg> I want to sort a table before it is displayed in the browser is it possible to do that?
[21:05:42] <blaggs> Ok, I'm using .next() to select a ul element. Jquery is returning an object with [methods] [0] = DispHTMLUListElement ..... however when I attempt to call .removeCLass on the UL object ie8 doesn't do it.
[21:07:40] <xp_prg> blaggs do you know how I get the current url in jquery?
[21:08:26] <Cork> xp_prg: it depends on how your sending the table
[21:08:28] <blaggs> xp_prg: window.location.pathname
[21:08:43] <ror12> im wondering if the only way to track mouse movement properly within a canvas to wrap the canvas in a iframe? cause event.pageX / .pageY are wrong if i dont use an iframe
[21:08:52] <xp_prg> Cork well $(function() {}); runs when the browser loads
[21:09:03] <xp_prg> but is there a way to do things just before the page is displayed?
[21:09:11] <ror12> is there anyway to get mouse positions relative to an element and not the html document?
[21:09:53] <Cork> xp_prg: ya, but sorting the dom table can take a long time
[21:10:07] <Cork> xp_prg: that is if the table is really long
[21:10:51] <Cork> ror12: event.clientX/Y
[21:10:54] <xp_prg> Cork well the problem is that the page shows the table before I can sort it then I sort it, I hate that :(
[21:11:44] <Cork> xp_prg: ya, rendering still happens while the domcontentready is triggered
[21:11:58] <Cork> s/ready/loaded/
[21:12:34] <Cork> xp_prg: an alternative is to send the table as an array and sort it before its added to the dom
[21:12:34] <ror12> cork, i dont see that in the jquery docs, but i tried it, it doesn't do it relative to the element (canvas in my case)
[21:12:46] <xp_prg> Cork don't have that possibility
[21:12:48] <Cork> xp_prg: or even better, sort it server side ;)
[21:13:25] <Cork> ror12: its native javascript object
[21:13:32] <Cork> ?mdc event.clientX
[21:13:34] <bot-t> Cork, event.clientX - MDN - Mozilla Developer Network - Returns the horizontal coordinate within the application's client area at which the event occurred (as opposed to the coordinates within the page). For example, clicking in the top-left corner of t... https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/event.clientX
[21:14:36] <ror12> ah ok, so no way to get it mouse position relative to the element? hmm i wonder if i just do some math here, heh , position of element and subtract that from pageX,pageY
[21:15:07] <ror12> or should i just use an iframe?
[21:15:15] <ror12> anything wrong with iframes?
[21:15:40] <Cork> uh.. lots and lots are wrong with iframes
[21:15:49] <Cork> its a hell to work with
[21:17:52] <ilteris> hey anyone familiar with cycle?
[21:18:15] <ilteris> I am trying to pass a new fx value on the complete of a transition, is that even possible?
[21:19:47] <Jarred> How do I do client-side email validation?
[21:20:12] <Cork> regex normally
[21:20:22] <Jarred> What's the regex?
[21:20:23] <Cork> on the submit event
[21:20:27] <Jarred> oh
[21:22:18] <Cork> Jarred: /^[a-zA-Z0-9_\-!\#\$%&*+~]+((\.?[a-zA-Z0-9_\-!\#\$%&*+~])?)+@([a-zA-Z0-9\-])+(\.?[a-zA-Z0-9\-])*$/.match($('input[name="email"]').val())
[21:23:54] <Whirl3d> doesn't match tld in domain name does it?
[21:24:16] <Cork> Whirl3d: you mean like @site.google? :D
[21:24:26] <Cork> its 2012 the end can be most anything
[21:24:44] <Cork> admin@jquery.cork
[21:24:51] <Jarred> I'm getting "Range out of order in character class" when trying to use that
[21:25:21] <Whirl3d> your email address is no longer required to have a domain identifier like cork@jquery.com
[21:25:33] <Whirl3d> username@gmail
[21:25:37] <Whirl3d> shouldn't be valid
[21:25:45] <Cork> it should
[21:26:06] <Whirl3d> for real? Where do you get this information?
[21:26:08] <Cork> it just means gmail is the tld
[21:26:38] <Whirl3d> gmail.com is the tld. the mailserver won't know if I meant gmail.com or gmail.net or ...
[21:26:47] <Whirl3d> or gmail.ru or gmail.la
[21:27:06] <Cork> Whirl3d: the point is, com. ru. la. isn't the only tld allowed anymore
[21:27:13] <Cork> ANYONE can buy one
[21:27:19] <Cork> it costs a fortune, but anyone can
[21:27:33] <Whirl3d> so you could buy .xxx?
[21:27:39] <ror12> oh are you an admin @ jquery.com ?
[21:27:41] <Whirl3d> no more .com?
[21:27:43] <Cork> no its already registered
[21:27:52] <Whirl3d> when did this happen?
[21:28:05] <pifantastic> Cork wtf are you talking about
[21:28:10] <ror12> when you refocus the jquery.com window, its annoying to me that it auto-scrolls to the top of the page
[21:28:29] <Cork> Whirl3d: it went into effect 2012-01-01
[21:28:34] <ror12> i lose my place when i'm reading something and tab to something else
[21:28:51] <pifantastic> ror12: link to a page where that happens
[21:29:09] <Whirl3d> reference url, please?
[21:29:12] <ror12> http://api.jquery.com/category/css/
[21:29:17] <ror12> using google chrome
[21:29:27] <ror12> scroll mid way down, goto another tab, go back to the jquery tab
[21:29:35] <pifantastic> ror12: wow, yeah, good point
[21:30:06] <prkchp_sndwch> hi, I'm trying to implement hide / show toggling functionality but I'm having trouble expressing what I need to be done in pure jQuery. can anyone help me remove this random helper function? http://jsfiddle.net/Mw4xA/
[21:30:10] <pifantastic> ror12: actually, I think that is browser behavior
[21:30:12] <Cork> Whirl3d: http://www.pcworld.com/article/248008/icann_begins_accepting_applications_for_generic_toplevel_domains.html
[21:30:42] <Whirl3d> Checking it out now. THanks for the info. Dang, I gotta adjust a bunch of sites
[21:31:01] <Cork> Whirl3d: i had a better linke once
[21:31:06] <Cork> but can't find it now
[21:31:16] <ror12> pifantastic: it doesn't do it for any other site
[21:31:17] <Cork> it was where icann publisned the plans
[21:31:41] <ror12> something must be bugging out with jquery site and google chrome then, i haven't tried another browser, but doesn't do it on other sites for my google chrome version
[21:33:00] <ilteris> hey guys, I am very n00b about jquery, I am trying to use cycle to do some transitions, http://pastie.org/3217385 does anyone know how can I pass another value to fx when I am already inside after?
[21:33:10] <pifantastic> prkchp_sndwch: http://jsfiddle.net/hdyqT/3/
[21:33:55] <prkchp_sndwch> thanks for that pifantastic!
[21:34:36] <prkchp_sndwch> also, good to know there's a toggle method. I've been using .is(":visible") forever
[21:34:44] <oojacoboo> is anyone around that could give me a hand with a tricky situation I'm having with a POST
[21:35:59] <pifantastic> prkchp_sndwch: also, you really want to structure a fiddle like this: http://jsfiddle.net/hdyqT/5/
[21:36:13] <pifantastic> ?ask @ oojacoboo
[21:36:13] <bot-t> oojacoboo, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[21:36:22] <prkchp_sndwch> ahh, thanks for that
[21:36:30] <ror12> i wonder if jquery team will ever make a canvas library :O
[21:36:31] <oojacoboo> pifantastic: I don't even know where to start :/
[21:36:36] <prkchp_sndwch> I'm used to codepad and pastebin for just dumping in files
[21:36:44] <pifantastic> ?p @ oojacoboo
[21:36:44] <bot-t> oojacoboo, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[21:37:02] <pifantastic> prkchp_sndwch: jsfiddle is a vast improvement over normal paste bins
[21:37:09] <oojacoboo> yea… that will tell about 1/10th of this issue...
[21:37:11] <Cork> Jarred: sorry the syntax i gave you was a bit from another language :)
[21:37:17] <pifantastic> oojacoboo: start talking
[21:37:41] <pifantastic> ror12: probably not
[21:37:42] <oojacoboo> ok, so, I'm posting a form to php using a post, serializing the post data
[21:37:43] <Cork> Jarred: this should work /^[a-zA-Z0-9_\-!\#\$%&*+~]+((\.?[a-zA-Z0-9_\-!\#\$%&*+~])?)+@([a-zA-Z0-9\-])+(\.?[a-zA-Z0-9\-])*$/.test($('input[name="email").val())
[21:37:49] <oojacoboo> I have a complex array that's being sent
[21:38:14] <pifantastic> Cork: you can't effectively validate an email with regex. see: http://www.ex-parrot.com/pdw/Mail-RFC822-Address.html
[21:38:35] <oojacoboo> on the php side, I'm only able to show the array in a var_dump every 1/4 times or so
[21:38:41] <oojacoboo> the rest of the times, I get a null
[21:38:46] <Cork> pifantastic: i know, and i was about to say "don't forget to validate it on server side too"
[21:39:02] <Whirl3d> http://newgtlds.icann.org/en/
[21:39:35] <Cork> pifantastic: but to just catch some errors is a good start to reduce the rundtrip to the server
[21:39:48] <pifantastic> oojacoboo: can you verify that you are always sending the data you think you are using Firebug or Inspector?
[21:40:11] <pifantastic> Cork: unless you are counting valid email addresses as valid
[21:40:18] <oojacoboo> it's localhost, but sure, haven't had that issue before
[21:40:23] <oojacoboo> or anywhere else for that matter
[21:40:54] <pifantastic> oojacoboo: I'm just saying, dont only assume the server is the issue, make sure the requests themselves look correct
[21:41:08] <pifantastic> Firebug/Inspector show the complete request/response which is a great way to debug
[21:41:15] <oojacoboo> pifantastic: I don't think the server is the issue
[21:41:19] <Jagan_> hi hi
[21:41:43] <Jagan_> can any 1 suggested gud tutorial for jquery
[21:41:45] <pifantastic> oojacoboo: so pop open the Net tab in inspector, make 4 requests, and send me a screenshot
[21:41:57] <oojacoboo> yea, I'm on it
[21:42:02] <pifantastic> Jagan_: http://jqfundamentals.com/
[21:42:50] <Jagan_> thanks pifantastic
[21:45:00] <Jagan_> Anybody have Good knowledge in Jqplot?
[21:49:14] <Jagan_> I need to know how to use jqplot with Java.Can Any one Guide me?
[21:49:39] <oojacoboo> pifantastic: I see the post form data being submitted, but I see possibly another issue that could be causing it
[21:49:46] <oojacoboo> based on some binding issues it seems
[21:49:55] <ilteris> do you guys see anything wrong with this code? http://pastie.org/3217425
[21:49:56] <oojacoboo> but the post is working fine
[21:50:07] <ilteris> I am pressing my arrows but I don't see any transition at all
[21:50:07] <pifantastic> oojacoboo: but is the data IN the post?
[21:50:15] <oojacoboo> pifantastic: yep
[21:50:28] <pifantastic> oojacoboo: is the request the same every time?
[21:50:34] <oojacoboo> pifantastic: yes
[21:51:19] <Whirl3d> when separating multiple local variable declarations, if you need to refer to a previous declaration, you have to start a new var statement, right?  In other words: var x=40, y=50, z=x*y   or var x=40, y=50; var z=x*y;  ?
[21:51:21] <oojacoboo> pifantastic: it appears it's submitting 2
[21:51:25] <oojacoboo> at the same time
[21:51:43] <oojacoboo> one with Content-Type:application/x-www-form-urlencoded
[21:51:46] <oojacoboo> one without
[21:51:49] <pifantastic> Whirl3d: the first will work
[21:52:00] <pifantastic> ?eval var x=40, y=50, z=x*y; z;
[21:52:05] <bot-t> pifantastic: 2000
[21:52:17] <Whirl3d> excellent. thanks for clearing that up for me.
[21:53:10] <theBrettman> anyone got a good config for vim so I don't have to set anything up?
[21:53:18] <pifantastic> ?g gf3 dotfiles
[21:53:19] <bot-t> pifantastic, gf3/dotfiles - GitHub - https://github.com/gf3/dotfiles
[21:53:23] <pifantastic> theBrettman: ^
[21:53:27] <theBrettman> thx
[21:53:54] <theBrettman> does it look like jsfiddle?
[21:54:01] <pifantastic> oojacoboo: make sure you're not binding an event multiple times or something
[21:54:01] <nomad111> is it possible to reset a deferred object's state after it has resolved?
[21:54:08] <oojacoboo> pifantastic: I think I am
[21:54:13] <Jagan_> HI
[21:54:18] <pifantastic> nomad111: why not just create a new Deferred?
[21:54:41] <Zappy> Hello ? what i wrong with this JSON-response from my php-page: a:2:{s:10:"Path2Image";s:53:"http://www.sauffaus.dk/HexGame/Map/Generator/Test.png";s:11:"ImageHeight";i:100;}
[21:54:55] <pifantastic> nomad111: also, callbacks added after the Deferred has been resolved should still execute
[21:55:15] <pifantastic> Zappy: that is not JSON, that is PHP Serialization
[21:55:24] <nomad111> pifantastic: doesn't look to be the case on my end, ill double check
[21:55:34] <Zappy> AH ? thx pifantastic :)
[21:56:53] <oojacoboo> pifantastic: is it an issue that the submit event is being delegated?
[21:56:58] <oojacoboo> are there issues with that?
[21:58:22] <pifantastic> oojacoboo: I'm not sure what you mean
[21:58:41] <oojacoboo> http://files.jacobt.com/double_requests.png
[21:59:33] <pifantastic> oojacoboo: hmm, I would really need to see your code before I could tell what was going on
[21:59:58] <oojacoboo> pifantastic: one second, I'll paste something
[22:00:33] <pifantastic> oojacoboo: it is a good strategy to recreate the problem with the least amount of code
[22:00:59] <oojacoboo> pifantastic: yes, I understand, but sometimes it's not that easy
[22:01:24] <pifantastic> oojacoboo: if you would have done that first, I bet you wouldn't still be fighting the problem now :)
[22:01:44] <pifantastic> #js
[22:05:54] <chovy> i have an <ol> with a fixed height, and I'm using scrollTop to scroll the next set of <li>'s into view. How do I calculate how far to scroll it?
[22:06:02] <chovy> I can only show 8 <li>'s at a time.
[22:12:31] <Zappy> Question: I'm generating an image, and sending some info plus a path via $.getJSON ? on return I update the info and path in the DOM ? BUT, the path is sometimes identical, so the browser have the image cached and won't fetch the new image-data ? any ideas how to force the browser to fetch again?
[22:12:35] <ilteris> guys, why do I have a syntax error here? http://pastie.org/3217483
[22:12:59] <ilteris> please help a n00b out :/
[22:13:21] <ilteris> this is what I get as an error: http://dl.dropbox.com/u/2070808/Screenshots/2i.png
[22:13:34] <pifantastic> Zappy: add a cache breaking GET param to the Image src
[22:14:01] <pifantastic> ?eval var src = 'image.png?' + (+new Date); src;
[22:14:03] <bot-t> pifantastic: "image.png?1327040025513"
[22:14:08] <pifantastic> Zappy: ^
[22:14:27] <Cork> Zappy: {"selected"} is not parable
[22:14:40] <Cork> Zappy: is should be addClass("selected")
[22:14:45] <Cork> and removeClass
[22:15:03] <Zappy> pifantastic ? Thx ? I'll try that :)
[22:15:20] <Zappy> Cork: ??
[22:15:32] <Cork> Zappy: sorry wrong nick
[22:15:33] <pifantastic> Zappy: Cork meant to say that to ilteris
[22:15:38] <Zappy> :)
[22:15:47] <ilteris> ah
[22:15:52] <Cork> ilteris: that was for you :)
[22:15:58] <pifantastic> ilteris: {} are for objects, "" for strings
[22:16:01] <ilteris> lovely, hold on I Am trying to understand.
[22:16:43] <ilteris> gotcha
[22:17:05] <Cork> ilteris: more precisly objects {} is built up of key:value pares
[22:17:17] <Cork> and you only provide one, so its not parsable
[22:17:35] <Zappy> pifantastic: I get your idea ? but it poses a problem, as I need the image to overwrite an existing image on the server, as not to produce a billion images to fill up
[22:18:20] <ilteris> gotcha so if it's an object it should be in curly braces if it's a string then I should be using ("")
[22:18:29] <ilteris> thanks Cork :)
[22:18:44] <pifantastic> Zappy: right, and your server should ignore the cache-busting GET param when it fetches the image
[22:19:18] <pifantastic> Zappy: and serve up the new image that overwrote the old image
[22:20:34] <Zappy> pifantastic: ok ? I might have misunderstood ? I'll look into it ? right now: brb
[22:21:49] <ilteris> cork: http://pastie.org/3217483 this still gives me problems. :(
[22:22:07] <ilteris> Cork: all I amtrying to do is to replicate this solution: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1465101/jquery-cycle-fade-order-change I fail miserably.
[22:22:22] <ilteris> I wish this was objective c. god...
[22:22:34] <Cork> ilteris: what line is throwing the error?
[22:23:00] <ilteris> Cork: http://dl.dropbox.com/u/2070808/Screenshots/2j.png
[22:23:26] <pifantastic> ilteris: click() takes a function as an argument, but you are passing in nonsense
[22:24:15] <Cork> ah, ya you need to define an inline function, you can't write code in an object :)
[22:24:52] <ilteris> oh.  that click should be in a function?
[22:24:59] <Cork> and Console doens't exist
[22:25:00] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/FSs8P/
[22:25:32] <pifantastic> ilteris: http://jsfiddle.net/GR87L/
[22:25:32] <ilteris> wow interesting website :)
[22:26:20] <muzone> I'm trying to do this simplified checkout login thing: http://i.imgur.com/aXE4V.png
[22:26:23] <muzone> After pressing the checkout button, if the user has a password, then proceed with regular checkout. If not, proceed with guest checkout.
[22:26:26] <muzone> Was told I needed some clever JS / form action swapping that changes the post action of the form to relevant existing Spree action. Anybody know where to start though? All I got is: https://gist.github.com/1645609
[22:26:29] <ilteris> oh thanks guys.
[22:26:40] <theBrettman> pifantastic: to install dotfiles, I have to install hg-git with easy_install but I get fatal error: Python.h: No such file or directory
[22:27:07] <mindis|wurk> ilteris if that made you miss proper programming languages, wait until you start building 'classes'
[22:27:28] <pifantastic> theBrettman: not really the right channel for that question :)
[22:27:44] <ilteris> mindis|wurk I am having a really tough time figuring this out :) I am so used to object oriented I am literally crying :)
[22:28:04] <pifantastic> ilteris: javascript _is_ object oriented
[22:28:05] <ilteris> and I need to put some transitions by 7am in the morning using cycle :/
[22:28:13] <theBrettman> like there's a channel for that question that has anyone that's going to answer, lol
[22:28:20] <pifantastic> in fact
[22:28:24] <pifantastic> everything extends from Object
[22:28:38] <pifantastic> theBrettman: are you on Windows, OSX, Linux?
[22:28:58] <ilteris> pifantastic: yeah I just need some time to figure it out :)
[22:29:03] <theBrettman> linux. ok, I'll check python first and then linux but that's a lil too much traffic
[22:29:19] <pifantastic> theBrettman: http://happy-coding.com/python-h-no-such-file-or-directory/
[22:29:37] <pifantastic> try sudo apt-get install python-dev
[22:30:13] <ilteris> Cork: why did you say Console doesn't exist?
[22:30:47] <pifantastic> ilteris: It's `console` not Console
[22:30:54] <pifantastic> that is assuming you are using the console API
[22:30:54] <ilteris> oh gotcha.
[22:30:57] <pifantastic> ?g console API
[22:30:58] <bot-t> pifantastic, Console API - FirebugWiki - http://getfirebug.com/wiki/index.php/Console_API
[22:31:03] <pifantastic> ilteris: Javascript is case sensitive
[22:31:12] <ilteris> pifantastic, thanks for the heads up.
[22:31:17] <Cork> ilteris: its should be lowcase
[22:31:34] <pifantastic> ?eval var LOL = 'wtf'; lol = 'rofl'; LOL + lol;
[22:31:35] <bot-t> pifantastic: "wtfrofl"
[22:45:47] <muzone> Anybody know how to do JS form action swapping? I need to simplify my plus-size female underwear store's checkout login screen (go to http://demo.spreecommerce.com/products/sirius-home-pnp-antenna - click "Add To Cart" and then "Checkout" to see the checkout login screen) into this: http://i.imgur.com/aXE4V.png

[22:48:41] <aro> plus size females?
[22:52:36] <muzone> aro: yeah?
[22:55:19] <gianiaz> Hi, anybody can help me with this issue? http://jsfiddle.net/DTcNf/2/ I have to create a ui.button on a link that was hidden with display none and showed with jquery.show(), but I have an odd result
[23:03:48] <fullsailor> .show() is changing the display property to 'inline' instead of 'block.
[23:04:01] <fullsailor> Use .css('display','block') instead
[23:04:02] <fullsailor> http://jsfiddle.net/DTcNf/3/
[23:04:22] <gianiaz> fullsailor, thank you
[23:04:37] <gianiaz> I was sure that show was applying display:block
[23:04:52] <gianiaz> I've also tried using display inline as you suggested :P
[23:04:53] <fullsailor> http://jqapi.com/#p=show
[23:05:20] <fullsailor> It only knows to display: block if you originally hide it with.hide()
[23:05:44] <gianiaz> fullsailor, thank you very much :-)
[23:06:11] <fullsailor> You're most welcome
[23:20:58] <Zappy> pifantastic: Great sucess with the extra parameter on the image-path ? thx alot :)
[23:32:54] <WitzHsiao> hi all, can query use in FB JS API ?
[23:34:58] <fullsailor> It should, assuming the question is: "Does jQuery work with the FB JS API?"
[23:36:46] <Zappy> WitzHsiao: Not unless jQuery is part of what FB offers (serves to it's users) ? which I doubt ? but I really don't know
[23:36:46] <Zappy> [08:33]
[23:37:44] <WitzHsiao> Thank you both
