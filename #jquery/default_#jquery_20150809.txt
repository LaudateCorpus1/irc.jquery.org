[00:57:36] <ftopwr> hi anyone here?
[00:58:09] <Cronon> just ask your question
[00:58:44] <ftopwr> is it possible to parse xmp if the url looks like this?
[00:58:44] <ftopwr> https://www.buffalopartners.com/xml/jackpots
[01:07:20] <danieli> ftopwr: why would the URL make any difference
[01:07:25] <danieli> the data it sends is still XML
[01:07:37] <danieli> assuming you meant "parse XML" and not "parse xmp"
[01:20:42] <ftopwr> danieli: yes
[01:20:55] <ftopwr> I'm trying to parse and display it now
[01:21:02] <danieli> should be parseable
[01:24:53] <ftopwr> danieli: it should be loading here: http://www.casinobuzz.info/new-jackpots-page-with-xml/
[01:24:56] <ftopwr> but it's not
[01:27:30] <danieli> the code makes the request, gets the xml, parses it and passes it to your code at least
[01:33:31] <ftopwr> danieli: yeah, just have to keep trying

[06:09:32] <nikhil_> hi, i am using instafeed.js (http://instafeedjs.com/) and swiper (http://www.idangero.us/swiper/) I have code like this (https://dpaste.de/uHZt) inside a file called main.js. The problem is that the swiper is not correctly initialising when i use it with instafeed like this (i just get a list of images with no swiper). Any help?
[06:09:40] <nikhil_> interestingly, when I resize the window the swiper initialises and i can use it

[12:17:55] <idontcare1> $(hello)
[13:11:06] <banana_> what is the difference in css between "div h1" and "div>h1" ?
[13:12:54] <banana_> aww nvm i got it, > is first layer of children, "div h1" is h1 at any level in a div
[14:14:52] <DJDan> is there a way with JQuery to load a XML file locally without a webserver?
[15:01:45] <unnu> hey guys, got a question: how can i add an event listener after the page has already been loaded?
[15:03:00] <unnu> ive got a "dashboard" sort of deal, and wanna add a .click listener without adding it beforehand, so after i $.ajax the content portion of the page, how would i add a $('#ajaxedButton').click() listener?
[15:03:22] <unnu> if that makes any sense
[15:06:00] <unnu> looks like jQuery.getScript() will do what i need . . . nvm and thanks folks
[15:13:58] <arc_> unnu you should use a delegated event handler
[15:14:00] <arc_> http://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/
[15:14:38] <arc_> you bind to an element that exists on page load, and listens for the elements that get loaded in later
[15:15:46] <unnu> thanks arc_, i've done a ('#content').on('click', '#ajaxedButton', function(){ //dostuff }); and that seems to work
[15:16:19] <arc_> lol. did you figure that out before i mentioned it, or did you manage to figure out what to do that quickly :p
[15:17:17] <unnu> lol, ive been away from JS for a while. . . used to be a backend guy, but these days I am a fullstack. Came here to "refresh my memory" so to speak . . . i knew it was something stupid easy like that
[15:17:28] <arc_> oic
[15:17:39] <unnu> when you sent the link i was like "DOH"
[15:17:40] <unnu> lol
[15:18:23] <unnu> building a HUGE web app for a friend's company . . . i can honestly say it is testing my abilities
[15:18:33] <aNewBy> guys I've got this: jQuery(select, content.document); and I wanna know what "content.document" does here... can someone tell me? coz I get the same result with and without
[15:20:42] <unnu> aNewBy, are you loading somethign into an iframe?
[15:21:51] <Sergeantsarz> Hello everyone. c:
[15:22:20] <Sergeantsarz> Novice person here seeking advice on how to accomplish a very simple task.
[15:24:21] <aNewBy> unnu i'm trying to access a page from outside :)
[15:24:24] <aNewBy> something like that
[15:34:14] <Sergeantsarz> Figured it out. Lawl. BUT
[15:34:31] <unnu> aNewBy, if you say var x = $("#myiframe");, which has lets say a background of blue, you could change it to white via var y= (x.contentWindow || x.contentDocument); y.getElementByID("body").style.backgroundColor = "green";
[15:34:40] <Sergeantsarz> I shall stay in this room for further jQuery and JavaScript distress.
[15:34:42] <unnu> or something to that effect
[15:35:45] <unnu> aNewBy, you can read more at https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLIFrameElement
[15:42:19] <aNewBy> unnu i'll check it out
[17:11:50] <unnu> how would you call in an optional form feild?
[17:25:07] <Woet> .... optional?
[18:56:36] <bePolite> Hello
[18:56:50] <bePolite> Is it possible to add a condition to .each[] with jquery?
[18:57:18] <bePolite> eg I have $.each([ 52, 97 ],  function(){})
[18:57:37] <bePolite> But I would like the callback to be run only if the elements in the array are >60
[18:59:20] <rcyr> bePolite: You'd use a filter function before the each.
[18:59:40] <rcyr> I personally avoid jQuery iteration methods for non-dom stuff unless I have to support IE8
[19:00:36] <rcyr> With IE9+, you could simply write: [52, 97].filter(function(n) { return n > 60; }).forEach(function(n) { doSomethingWithN(n); });
[19:01:27] <bePolite> Wow rcyr but can't I do same with jquery
[19:01:59] <bePolite> [52, 97].filter(function(n) { return n > 60; }).each(function(n) { doSomethingWithN(n); });
[19:02:01] <bePolite> ?
[19:02:31] <rcyr> Nah, jQuery doesn't modify Array.prototype
[19:02:48] <rcyr> The jQuery way would probably be something like$.each($.grep([52, 97], function(n) { return n > 60; }), function() { doSomethingWithN(this); });
[19:02:56] <rcyr> Which is rather ugly... imho
[19:03:11] <rcyr> Might as well do a $.each and add a "if" inside
[19:03:34] <bePolite> It seems  I may just add the if statement inside
[19:03:52] <rcyr> Yeah...
[19:05:07] <rcyr> bePolite: If you don't need IE8 support... or need IE8 support (and use es5-shim)... I highly suggest that you avoid using jQuery for non-dom stuff
[19:06:29] <bePolite> rcyr: Ohh it is a dom stuff
[19:06:39] <bePolite> I used the array just for  an example
[19:06:51] <rcyr> Then it's different
[19:06:58] <bePolite> Anyway why do you suggest I don't use jQuery? perf reasons?
[19:06:59] <rcyr> jQuery collections are not arrays
[19:07:43] <rcyr> bePolite: Because ES5 has better and more versatile iteration methods... and of course, it's a bit weird to use a DOM abstraction layer to do things that are not DOM-related.
[19:08:01] <bePolite> Makes sense
[19:08:08] <rcyr> ES5 has: .map/.filter/.forEach/.some/.every/.reduce/.reduceRight etcc..
[19:08:47] <rcyr> But if your array is in fact a jquery collection, just use the jquery methods
[19:08:54] <rcyr> What would be the filter?
[19:09:03] <rcyr> What would you like to filter on?
[19:09:42] <bePolite> I'm filtering on  the index of a particular row
[19:09:52] <bePolite> Let me make a sample fiddle
[19:11:06] <rcyr> As long as you're working with jQuery objects, you can do things like: myJQueryArrayLike.filter(function() { return $(this).index() % 2 === 0; }).each(function() { $(this).css('color', 'red'); });

[19:14:00] <asdad> hey bePolite !
[19:14:28] <bePolite> yep
[19:14:44] <bePolite> Thanks rcyr
[19:14:46] <asdad> I am your GSoC 14 friend :)
[19:15:01] <asdad> Bugzilla YUI2 to YUI# migration
[19:15:03] <bePolite> rcyr:  Is that cleaner than http://jsfiddle.net/bePolite/46t4t6nj/ in your opinion
[19:15:08] <asdad> remember ?
[19:15:13] <bePolite> yep remember
[19:15:25] <asdad> i have adifferent nick here though
[19:15:31] <bePolite> I remember the GSOC project asdad but I don't remember you so much
[19:15:42] <asdad> bePolite: I am ishitva
[19:15:51] <bePolite> ahh nice
[19:16:12] <asdad> bePolite: did you get through with gsoc this time ?
[19:16:13] <rcyr> bePolite: I'd really go with your simple .each + "if" approach for that specific case.
[19:16:27] <bePolite> Thanks rcyr
[19:16:39] <bePolite> asdad: lets do pm?
[19:16:46] <asdad> bePolite: sure
[22:47:47] <renka> good morning. :)
[23:13:08] <morphyeys> morning guys
[23:13:16] <morphyeys> could you help me to debug something
[23:13:34] <morphyeys> I am a newbie and I want to learn as fast as possible
[23:41:24] <norc> Hi, before I reinvent the wheel. Is there some jquery functionality that lets me define a list of CSS classes, and toggle between them so a node has only a single class at a given time?
[23:41:34] <norc> Or should I just roll my own removing and adding classes
[23:48:56] <hellyeah> hey
[23:49:28] <hellyeah> when you click the button i want shake effect and it slowly disappear how can i do that any suggestion?
