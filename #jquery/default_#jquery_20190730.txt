[11:48:55] <lapide_viridi> Could someone please provide me with some feedback on how to improve this? https://pastebin.ubuntu.com/p/g2pKW8HbQn/ It is a callback function running after a simulator has completed on the server and returned the results via AJAX. However, what started out as a small append of HTML to a div has increased somewhat. Any suggestions?
[11:49:22] <robertmaxrees> get a templating engine
[11:50:01] <robertmaxrees> is response.sites an array?
[11:50:20] <robertmaxrees> if so, that entire loop can be easily abstracted into a separate function
[11:50:49] <robertmaxrees> as an aside - for loops don't have scope, so all those vars you'
[11:51:00] <robertmaxrees> *you're declaring within it aren't really scoped to the loop
[11:52:50] <robertmaxrees> lapide_viridi
[12:14:49] <lapide_viridi> robertmaxrees, response.sites in a dict/json. For some reason, dot notation didn't work there.
[12:14:58] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[12:15:12] <robertmaxrees> JS doesn't have "dicts" - can you share an example of the data?
[12:15:47] <lapide_viridi> robertmaxrees, I have Jinja on the Flask server. Should I rather generate the HTML and then send it to the client, rather than doing it in JS client side?
[12:15:56] <robertmaxrees> no.
[12:16:01] <robertmaxrees> you should render client-side.
[12:20:20] <lapide_viridi> robertmaxrees, sorry for the bad formatting. Had to copy from the console. https://pastebin.ubuntu.com/p/xm6m6gh3Z3/
[12:20:25] <lapide_viridi> But that is the data structure
[12:20:39] <robertmaxrees> do you have any control over the data format?
[12:20:53] <lapide_viridi> Mostly, yeah
[12:21:00] <robertmaxrees> make Sites an array.
[12:21:15] <robertmaxrees> that will make your life MUCH easier.
[12:22:40] <lapide_viridi> I guess that would work, but what is wrong with JSON?
[12:22:49] <robertmaxrees> you're confusing terminology.
[12:23:03] <robertmaxrees> JSON != javascript object.
[12:23:26] <robertmaxrees> JSON is just a format that JS happens to be able to parse.  once you parse it, you have an object.
[12:23:55] <robertmaxrees> the issue with your current format is you want to treat sites like an array.
[12:24:05] <robertmaxrees> which is hard to do when it's just an object :)
[12:25:28] <lapide_viridi> I made it such so one could do lookups using keys rather than an array. The way I use it might make it easier with an array, yes
[12:25:56] <lapide_viridi> Hmm. I guess my data isn't actually valid JSON after all.
[12:25:59] <robertmaxrees> it's trivial to change that to lookup by a property of an object within an array.
[12:26:02] <robertmaxrees> what do you mean?
[12:26:42] <lapide_viridi> Oh, perhaps I misunderstood you. The data has JSON format, but it is parsed by JS, so it's really an object?
[12:27:35] <lapide_viridi> Regarding the templating you mentioned. Is there a template engine for JS?
[12:30:30] <lapide_viridi> Also, I could fix the scoping of the variables inside the for-loop by using let rather than var, right?
[12:31:03] <robertmaxrees> after JSON is parsed, it's just an object.
[12:31:13] <robertmaxrees> for templating engines, there are a tom.
[12:31:23] <robertmaxrees> just search google and go to town :)
[12:32:20] <robertmaxrees> and for scoping, you could fix it that way though I'd be cognizant of browser incompatibilities.  also, if you make the sites property an array, using a forEach instead would be a natural fix.
[12:33:50] <lapide_viridi> Ok, will try those things! Thanks!
[16:21:36] <Levin^2> hello there
[16:21:48] <Levin^2> my logic here is wrong I guess
[16:21:48] <Levin^2> https://codepen.io/anon/pen/eqWYMN?editors=1011
[16:22:05] <Levin^2> what I want to do is to replace the title with the text defined in my html
[16:22:43] <Levin^2> but my loop is not placing the replaced text at each box, it's putting it all in the same first box
[16:23:10] <taplar> you're not repeating ids are you?
[16:23:37] <Levin^2> no, only classes
[16:23:56] <taplar> do you have a fiddle showing what you're doing?
[16:23:56] <Levin^2> https://codepen.io/anon/pen/eqWYMN?editors=1011
[16:24:00] <taplar> gracias
[16:24:11] <Levin^2> you entered just after hehe
[16:24:31] <taplar> $(".toggles .linha-itinerario .vc-acf-field-picker-field-type-text") is a global selector
[16:24:55] <taplar> if you want to change only the things in your related toggles, you need to find it off of the element you are iterating over
[16:25:23] <Levin^2> hmm
[16:25:30] <taplar> $(elem).closest('.toggles').find(".linha-itinerario .vc-acf-field-picker-field-type-text")
[16:26:20] <Es0teric> i have a question about this https://kopy.io/G9SJA#line-39
[16:26:37] <robertmaxrees> Es0teric just ask :)
[16:26:38] <Es0teric> the line thats highlighted seems to be triggering an infinite loop of clicks... how do i make it stop on click
[16:26:53] <robertmaxrees> erm./
[16:27:01] <robertmaxrees> why are you calling click again?
[16:27:03] <Es0teric> its triggering some sort of infinite loop that makes divs look like duplicates
[16:27:30] <Es0teric> its supposed to generate a report in table format... the click just keeps occuring with a new offset everytime
[16:27:33] <Es0teric> to display more data
[16:27:46] <robertmaxrees> so do you want that to keep happening or no?
[16:28:19] <Es0teric> yeah i do but the problem is that it keeps running no matter what so now rows are starting to look like they contain duplicate data
[16:28:35] <robertmaxrees> so what case should it not to that nay more?
[16:28:42] <robertmaxrees> *do that
[16:28:52] <Es0teric> when it looks like there is no more data to be fetched
[16:29:08] <robertmaxrees> so then wrap a conditional around that call :)
[16:29:10] <robertmaxrees> problem solved.
[16:29:31] <Es0teric> but how can i tell that its the right data?
[16:29:38] <Es0teric> its already duplicating rows
[16:29:40] <Es0teric> on the call
[16:29:57] <robertmaxrees> i don't know how to answer that question because all i have is your click handler.
[16:30:10] <taplar> what exactly is the "offset"?
[16:30:19] <robertmaxrees> i don't know what the ajax call is returning or how you qualify the idea of "no more"
[16:31:56] <Es0teric> its going to a WP_Query
[16:32:07] <Es0teric> offset is just defining how many rows in the db to offset
[16:32:20] <taplar> so, you're always giving it the same offset
[16:32:30] <taplar> is that valid?
[16:32:38] <Es0teric> uhhh
[16:33:05] <robertmaxrees>  const offset = ; ?
[16:33:09] <taplar> ya
[16:33:20] <robertmaxrees> that's set to nothing lol
[16:33:33] <taplar> which to me seems like he's potentially fetching the same data over and over
[16:33:43] <robertmaxrees> that should just throw an error.
[16:34:09] <robertmaxrees> yeah, if that's how that line in writton on the page, then it'll just break.
[16:34:43] <Levin^2> taplar: thank you :) it worked
[16:34:49] <taplar> awesome
[16:35:01] <Levin^2> but can you check if I did it the way you explained?
[16:35:01] <Levin^2> https://codepen.io/anon/pen/eqWYMN?editors=1011
[16:35:19] <taplar> yep
[16:35:24] <Levin^2> alright :)
[16:35:35] <taplar> though "it worked" means you shouldn't have to ask me for confirmation, ;)
[16:36:02] <Levin^2> just wanted to make sure I didn't do it in somewhat twisted way lol
[16:36:17] <Levin^2> I know it's possible lol
[16:36:25] <taplar> fair enough
[17:05:05] <Levin^2> uhm
[17:05:24] <Levin^2> I reached a point I'm in doubt of a good solution for this
[17:05:26] <Levin^2> https://codepen.io/anon/pen/eqWYMN?editors=1011
[17:05:52] <taplar> what's the goal?
[17:05:53] <Levin^2> I had to add the <i> element to mimic my real code better, since contents() was erasing my <i>
[17:06:05] <Levin^2> I need to maintain <i> as is
[17:06:31] <robertmaxrees> so you want the entire element?
[17:06:36] <robertmaxrees> not just its contents?
[17:07:03] <Levin^2> only the text inside <a>, and not the <i> element
[17:07:16] <taplar> then put a span around the text you want to change
[17:07:40] <Levin^2> sadly I can't modify the html, as it's generated by my CMS
[17:07:49] <taplar> i thought you sand you added the <i>?
[17:08:05] <Levin^2> yes, to mimic my code better
[17:08:22] <Levin^2> when I added the previous code, the icon disappeared
[17:08:43] <Levin^2> so I need to refine the code to avoid erasing the <i>
[17:09:21] <Levin^2> I thought on storing the <i> somehow, then "echoing" it back
[17:09:33] <Levin^2> is that a good idea?
[17:12:11] <taplar> https://codepen.io/anon/pen/zgwBLq?editors=1011 is a potential approach
[17:12:37] <taplar> removed some of the later code, so refresh
[17:14:00] <taplar> though, in general, it is slightly awkward that you're manipulating the page like this
[17:14:26] <Levin^2> I know
[17:15:53] <Levin^2> this is the plan B :(
[17:16:10] <Levin^2> had to make things done, so
