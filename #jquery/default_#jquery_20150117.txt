[00:18:17] <vibrasfear> hey'all
[00:18:23] <vibrasfear> is there a non-bloat ui alternative?
[00:32:15] <rajlaksh> ReferenceError: jQuery is not defined please help version 2.2.1 using it like $j = jQuery();
[00:33:49] <rajlaksh> correction like $j = jQuery;
[00:49:16] <vibrasfear> why?
[00:49:32] <vibrasfear> why not use $?
[00:50:05] <vibrasfear> $.whateverjQuery()
[01:31:05] <gtristan> Hmmm, ok more annoying troubles with .height() :-S
[01:31:33] <gtristan> What I'm doing... is very very similar to this: http://jsfiddle.net/mg2sxv3a/
[01:31:41] <gtristan> which, works like a damn charm, really nicely
[01:32:19] <gtristan> but for some reason (or course with the DOM and CSS there are 1 million + 1 details to take into account), I am getting something different in my app
[01:33:02] <gtristan> the height is really 634 (in mozilla inspector) and my app is getting 622
[01:33:11] <gtristan> and so I scroll only 'almost to the bottom'
[01:33:40] <gtristan> A problem I previously encountered had to do with the margins of the .item class
[01:33:54] <gtristan> which I fixed by setting overflow: hidden in the .area class
[01:34:27] <gtristan> so that does something some CSS expert might understand... to make calculations of the '.area' widget inclusive of margins
[01:35:03] * gtristan wonders if there is some better DOM/CSS agnostic approach to getting the $(element).height()
[01:35:51] <gtristan> I mean the element is there on screen, shouldnt have to tweak and tinker in a humongous pile of options just to find it's actual height :-S
[01:36:46] <gtristan> fwiw I did try checking $(element).css ('height'), as it was noted in the jquery .height() docs, but it actually returns something *smaller*
[01:40:42] * gtristan thinks it may have to do with waiting for reflow
[01:42:14] <gtristan> indeed
[01:42:16] <gtristan> that's it
[01:42:41] <gtristan> I add an element to the DOM with .append(), then calculate the height of the area and the scrollable
[01:42:57] <gtristan> then I automatically animate scroll to the bottom so the newly added element is completely visible
[01:43:16] <gtristan> the problem is that the damn browser doesnt know the real height after .append()
[01:43:34] <gtristan> it needs to lazily reflow the document, leaving my previous calculation invalid
[01:46:56] <hellier> hi

[04:01:58] <cody__> Hello anyone around?
[04:02:10] <arthurvr> ‘allo!
[04:05:54] <cody__> Hey there.. Is there a way to make Embedded Google Spreadsheet link open the linked url with target: _self mode via jquery? Cause google spreadsheet will open a new tab everytime you click to a link on it by default...
[04:31:18] <vibrasfear> using the :data selector i can't select for a specific value, right?
[04:32:02] <arthurvr> :data selector?
[04:53:37] <Yatekii> hi guys!
[04:53:42] <arthurvr> hi!
[04:54:31] <Yatekii> can't I store jquery identifiers? everytime I do sth like : var bla = $('some name'); and then wanna do bla.somewhat(); it doesn't work but when I do $(bla).somewhat() it works
[05:24:06] <Ilhami> $.ajax()
[05:24:36] <arthurvr> Yatekii: yes you can
[05:24:49] <arthurvr> Ilhami: What’s up with $.ajax()?
[05:25:00] <Ilhami> it's nice.
[05:25:07] <Yatekii> hmm doesn't work for me arthurvr I have to do $() freshly all the time
[05:25:08] <arthurvr> haha
[05:25:25] <arthurvr> Yatekii: jsfiddle maybe?
[05:25:43] <arthurvr> Yatekii: it works but if you save selectors they don’t get updated with elements new in the dom?
[05:25:58] <Yatekii> arthurvr: nah normal page using bootstrap
[05:26:09] <Yatekii> no new dom element
[05:26:29] <Yatekii> doesn't even work when I modify nothing at all
[05:26:39] <Yatekii> well doesn't matter, I'll do a new one everytime
[05:26:53] <arthurvr> Yatekii: jsfiddle or upload it at testdomain
[05:27:03] <arthurvr> Yatekii: Don’t make new ones, that’s bad performance-wise
[05:27:21] <Yatekii> lol js is terrible performance wise anyways
[05:27:27] <Yatekii> js is terrible in a whole new level
[05:27:31] <Yatekii> but I need it :(
[05:27:31] <arthurvr> it isn’t if you use it right
[05:27:46] <arthurvr> https://eamann.com/tech/selector-caching-jquery/
[05:27:49] <Yatekii> yes it is ... the erroring is fucking terrible. at least in browsers
[05:28:08] <arthurvr> if you know how to use the debuggers properly, that isn’t a problem
[05:28:14] <arthurvr> but let’s not discuss that
[05:30:26] <Yatekii> no, it just ommits half the messages. the erroring wouldn't be bad. but it doesn't error half the times lol and just continue straight as if nothing happened ... anyways ...
[05:30:55] <arthurvr> again, if you know how to use the debuggers the right way, that’s not a problem
[05:30:59] <arthurvr> but let’s not discuss that
[05:38:54] <Yatekii> when I do .find() does it list the found dom elements in order I put them in the html?
[05:43:43] <arthurvr> in order they’re in the dom
[05:45:05] <arthurvr> Yatekii: ^^
[05:45:25] <Yatekii> .. yeah and what's that? is it random? or like in the html
[05:45:31] <Yatekii> well so I cannot use 0, 1, 2 etc
[05:45:31] <Yatekii> hmm
[05:45:35] <Yatekii> gotta do it better
[05:45:39] <arthurvr> the dom is what gets rendered from the html
[05:45:44] <arthurvr> but the dom can be manipulated
[05:46:01] <arthurvr> but if you don’t do any manipulations before, yes
[05:47:32] <Yatekii> I know what the dom is ;) I just don't know specifics :S
[05:47:35] <Yatekii> ok, tks!
[05:47:44] <Yatekii> but I'll do it better!
[05:47:44] <Yatekii> :D
[05:48:12] <Yatekii> question: arthurvr: can you tell me how I do get all neighbors of an element and select one of them by selector? :S
[05:49:00] <arthurvr> Yatekii: yes
[05:49:02] <Yatekii> I always have a <td><input><input></td> and I do some eventhandling on the first input and I would like to change some value on the second input
[05:49:06] <arthurvr> Yatekii: I’ll jsfiddle something
[05:49:11] <Yatekii> ty!
[05:51:24] <arthurvr> is this what you mean with ”neighbours”? http://jsfiddle.net/35cp6gaa/
[05:51:44] <Yatekii> yeah!
[05:51:46] <Yatekii> ty!!
[05:51:53] <Yatekii> hmm now I need to filter them somehow hmm
[05:51:57] <Yatekii> oh no wait
[05:51:59] <arthurvr> use .filter()
[05:52:00] <Yatekii> I can span em
[05:52:05] <Yatekii> so sthere is only 2
[05:52:18] <Yatekii> *<span></span> to group them
[05:52:19] <Yatekii> perfect
[05:52:20] <Yatekii> ty!
[05:52:33] <Yatekii> hmm
[05:53:10] <Yatekii> oh wait I could also only do the span and add the inputs by js right?
[05:53:20] <Yatekii> ah no I can't
[05:53:26] <Yatekii> or yes I can :D
[05:53:26] <arthurvr> yes but you shouldn’t add content using js
[05:53:32] <Yatekii> oO ok
[05:53:46] <Yatekii> isn't that what bootstrap and all the scripts dot?
[05:54:12] <arthurvr> think about accesibility, perf, and people that have js turned off
[05:54:19] <arthurvr> only do it when it’s needed
[05:54:26] <arthurvr> which it seems like that isn't
[05:55:30] <Yatekii> yeah
[05:55:42] <Yatekii> hmm doesn't filter only display children?
[05:55:56] <Yatekii> I mean when I do filter it normally gives me the children :S
[05:56:09] <arthurvr> it does exactly what is says, it filters a selection
[05:56:16] <arthurvr> `api filter
[05:56:16] <b-ot> arthurvr: .filter(): Reduce the set of matched elements to those that match the selector or pass the function's test.  http://api.jquery.com/filter/
[05:57:16] <Yatekii> ah so when I have a single element the children are considered as the set and when I have a list it's the elements in it
[05:57:43] <arthurvr> no they aren’t
[05:58:10] <arthurvr> think you’ve got the method kinda wrong
[05:58:17] <Yatekii> no I am retarded
[05:58:19] <Yatekii> I used find
[05:58:24] <arthurvr> http://jsfiddle.net/35cp6gaa/1/
[05:58:26] <arthurvr> oh
[05:58:52] <arthurvr> those methods are different :-)
[05:58:55] <arthurvr> `api find
[05:58:56] <b-ot> arthurvr: .find(): Get the descendants of each element in the current set of matched elements, filtered by a selector, jQuery object, or element. http://api.jquery.com/find/
[06:03:00] <Yatekii> yeah^
[06:03:06] <Yatekii> I know,m I just messed up, sorry
[06:09:27] <arthurvr> Yatekii: if there are other questions, feel free to ask :-)
[06:15:21] <Yatekii> arthurvr: I DID IT!
[06:15:23] <Yatekii> tyvm
[06:15:27] <Yatekii> yeah tyks so much!!
[06:15:39] <arthurvr> Yatekii: Yay!
[06:15:47] <Yatekii> https://backdoor.yatekii.ch/list_tokens/ was for the autocomplete on the owner field!
[06:15:56] <Yatekii> now I am impelementing the ability to change the owner
[06:16:07] <Yatekii> the autocomplete was working yet
[06:16:20] <Yatekii> but I wanted one for changing the owner too
[06:16:26] <Yatekii> so I had to make it more general
[06:16:38] <Yatekii> (if I'd just listened to the folks in #js before dang :D)
[06:16:39] <arthurvr> Looks good
[06:17:01] <Yatekii> the problem is that I want the user id in the background and not the name, so I need to set that manually in a field
[06:17:50] <BillCriswell> At work do you guys keep readme files in project folders? Like best practices for a project?
[06:18:02] <Yatekii> arthurvr: can I make it somehow that it applies the same for futore elements that meet those conditions? or isn't that advised?
[06:18:08] <arthurvr> BillCriswell: depends what kinds of projects
[06:18:30] <arthurvr> Yatekii: you can
[06:19:15] <arthurvr> BillCriswell: I mean, in libraries and stuff that will be used across different projects I have a readme
[06:19:30] <arthurvr> BillCriswell: doesn’t make sense in those little nasty projects I think
[06:20:20] <BillCriswell> arthurvr: What about for like.. getting a project up and running? Do you think a readme with build tool commands would be useful?
[06:20:51] <BillCriswell> Like: gulp sprites will generate sprites. Put them in ./src/sprite/ and use them with @include sprite("img-name");
[06:21:08] <BillCriswell> to build type "gulp"
[06:21:11] <arthurvr> BillCriswell: in general, yes, surely for the kind of situations you mentioned
[06:21:15] <BillCriswell> to watch type "gulp watch", shit liek that
[06:21:29] <BillCriswell> arthurvr: Ok cool. I don't see it often so I was wondering about the reasoning.
[06:21:43] <arthurvr> BillCriswell: Gulp/grunt tasks shouldn’t be in a project-specific readme, they should be standardised
[06:21:59] <arthurvr> BillCriswell: having different task names all over the place is a PITA
[06:22:27] <arthurvr> Yatekii: I think what you need is .delegate to bind events
[06:22:44] <arthurvr> Yatekii: That applies to elements that will get created in the future
[06:22:51] <arthurvr> `api delegate
[06:22:51] <b-ot> arthurvr: .delegate(): Attach a handler to one or more events for all elements that match the selector, now or in the future, based on a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[06:23:38] <arthurvr> BillCriswell: But for open source stuff just include them, nothing worse than having to figure that stuff out yourselfs
[06:23:40] <BillCriswell> arthurvr: I agree. They should definitely be intuitive but when conventions change or different things happen on different projects I think a readme on a project bases can help.
[06:23:47] <BillCriswell> arthurvr: Agreed.
[06:24:01] <BillCriswell> basis*
[06:24:01] <BillCriswell> lol
[06:24:26] <arthurvr> BillCriswell: Other related discussion could be if a contributing.md isn’t more appropriate then
[06:24:39] <BillCriswell> arthurvr: Ah, good point.
[06:25:08] <arthurvr> BillCriswell: but at the end stop discussing this kinds of stuff, and just do it. You’re wasting more time than you will ever save people with it :-)
[06:25:28] <BillCriswell> Oh I know I've already started, just wondering about opinions.
[06:25:40] <BillCriswell> I know a lot of the time I'm left to read the code to figure out how I should be setting something up.
[06:25:56] <arthurvr> BillCriswell: Agreed
[06:26:32] <BillCriswell> I wrote a comment puller a while back that I'm thinking wasn't a bad idea.
[06:27:34] <Yatekii> arthurvr: aaaah tyvm, now I remember, I used that once yyet
[06:27:52] <BillCriswell> arthurvr: https://github.com/crswll/gulp-notes wondering if I should use it lol
[06:28:23] <arthurvr> sometimes it can be useful
[06:28:56] <Yatekii> arthurvr: mybe I can ausk you that too, not sure: <button class="btn btn-default" type="button"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-ok" aria-hidden="true"></span></button> doesn't trigger the form, any idea?
[06:28:59] <BillCriswell> Shit, brb
[06:33:15] <arthurvr> Yatekii: nope it doesn’t
[06:33:29] <Yatekii> why? :S
[06:33:44] <arthurvr> because it’s just a button
[06:33:47] <arthurvr> not a submit button
[06:36:36] <Yatekii> oh
[06:36:39] <Yatekii> wow I am so bad haha
[06:36:51] <arthurvr> Yatekii: feel free to ask
[06:36:51] <Yatekii> hmm I ask myself if I can submit with it oo :S
[06:37:00] <arthurvr> yes you can
[06:37:12] <Yatekii> I didn't webdev since like 4 years and I never used the fancy new things :S
[06:37:20] <Yatekii> now I feel so hip^
[06:37:36] <Yatekii> (even back then I didn't use those things)
[06:37:40] <arthurvr> to let a form submit using a button, just give it a type=”submit”
[06:37:47] <arthurvr> and it must be in the <form>, of course
[06:38:04] <arthurvr> if you mean like a clientside submit, use submit()
[06:38:07] <arthurvr> `api submit
[06:38:08] <b-ot> arthurvr: .submit(): Bind an event handler to the "submit" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/submit/
[06:39:52] <Yatekii> oh yeah
[06:39:59] <Yatekii> kk ty!
[06:40:30] <Yatekii> how you mean a clieantside submit? isn't that always "send to server"?
[06:40:55] <arthurvr> Yatekii: maybe just wanted to do something client side before submitting
[06:41:01] <arthurvr> Yatekii: Or validation
[06:44:29] <Yatekii> ah yeah
[06:44:37] <Yatekii> I do it via ajax anyways :)
[06:44:52] <arthurvr> you shouldn’t if that’s not needed
[06:45:17] <Yatekii> hmm different question: can I somehow read the POSt arguments in an event when submit is triggered?
[06:45:28] <Yatekii> well I'll implement a non-js logic too
[06:45:31] <arthurvr> Yatekii: of course you can
[06:45:39] <Yatekii> but this specific app is only used at one certain place
[06:45:56] <arthurvr> Yatekii: the post arguments are just the values in your form, remember?
[06:45:58] <Yatekii> so I know the exact environment or better: I can choose what I need ;)
[06:46:07] <Yatekii> yeah
[06:46:22] <arthurvr> Yatekii: you never know the exact env
[06:46:48] <Yatekii> the problem is: inputs are spread between different spans and divs etc (because of bootstrap) so it's hard to read them by val()
[06:47:04] <arthurvr> it’s never hard to read them by val
[06:47:21] <arthurvr> the nesting shouldn’t be a problem
[06:47:28] <arthurvr> use serialize
[06:47:28] <Yatekii> well in this particular case I actually do :) and if not I adjust ... anyways I do a static implementation anyways
[06:47:33] <Yatekii> ah I can filte rby input hmm
[06:47:38] <Yatekii> oh k
[06:47:39] <Yatekii> hmm
[06:47:40] <arthurvr> http://api.jquery.com/serialize/
[06:47:52] <arthurvr> no filter won’t work
[06:48:02] <arthurvr> filter searches one level down in the nesting
[06:48:13] <arthurvr> serialize takes everyting, not sure if that’s what you want
[06:49:12] <Yatekii> kk
[06:49:21] <Yatekii> well I have one problem: there is multiple forms :S
[06:49:33] <arthurvr> that’s no problem
[06:49:38] <arthurvr> that’s why loops exist :-)
[06:49:52] <arthurvr> I’ll write up a fiddle for you if you want
[06:50:14] <Yatekii> yeah THAT is not the problem :D
[06:50:26] <Yatekii> the problem is that I only want the specific one wher ethe event came from
[06:50:27] <Yatekii> ;)
[06:50:38] <arthurvr> that’s no problem as well
[06:50:44] <arthurvr> let me show off in a fiddle
[06:50:45] <Yatekii> not for u ;)
[06:50:47] <Yatekii> kk ty
[06:50:59] <Yatekii> ohwell question about js/non js tho
[06:52:41] <Yatekii> https://backdoor.yatekii.ch/list_tokens/ try clicking on an owner name ... it will pop an edit. that's what I want to send by post, would you do it non-js in the first place? Ithought that when U want to do batch edit, you can pop every and then copy paste the name and then press the check for every entry ... if you have it handeled non js it would not alow that (no prob imo but why not have it)
[06:53:54] <Yatekii> same about the edit, js or non js? I coulda done an edit page for each token ... but I guess that's way handier and I know we'll have js at that computer :) (there is MANY outher apps that use js there too ... (we are a students lab and this is the frontend software for our nfc-backdoor ;))
[06:54:08] <Yatekii> (to open the door you get an nfc token)
[06:54:40] <Yatekii> (I can do the python abckend very easy but I struggle with js and doing everything properly ;)
[06:55:12] <Yatekii> hmm I need a quick shower I guess brb :)
[06:59:28] <Ilhami> .serialize();
[07:00:00] <arthurvr> Yup, with multiple forms something like http://jsfiddle.net/dcm0Lqx0/
[07:01:19] <lord4163> Is there any way to make jquery mobile work together with emberjs?
[07:02:28] <Ilhami> http://learn.jquery.com/ajax/ajax-and-forms/ arthurvr I am here now
[07:02:32] <Ilhami> reading this
[07:04:12] <arthurvr> Ilhami: hope you’re learning stuff :-)
[07:04:24] <Ilhami> Yeah it's cool!
[07:04:32] <Ilhami> I am reading a bit slowly but it's good so far.
[07:19:14] <Yatekii> ok re
[07:19:46] <arthurvr> Yatekii: About the multiple form thing: http://jsfiddle.net/dcm0Lqx0/
[07:20:09] <arthurvr> Yatekii: is that what you needed?
[07:20:11] <Yatekii> arthurvr: yeah saw it :)
[07:20:14] <Yatekii> ty!
[07:20:36] <Yatekii> question tho: is it right that I can also return flase instead of e.preventDefualt()?
[07:20:37] <Ilhami> jsonp
[07:20:44] <Ilhami> JSONP*
[07:20:46] <Yatekii> and what's your thoughts on my other questions?^
[07:20:46] <arthurvr> Yatekii: yes it is
[07:20:50] <Yatekii> kk ty!
[07:21:15] <arthurvr> Yatekii: I use preventDefault because that explicitly says what you want to do
[07:21:45] <Yatekii> yeah that's right
[07:21:54] <arthurvr> Yatekii: return false might be cofusing to noobs
[07:22:11] <Yatekii> yeah
[07:22:45] <Yatekii> question: https://bpaste.net/show/b5a4116b3f9a I always did it with each ... can I leave that away then? I feel kinda weird since you do $form.serialize and in fact it's a list of forms :D
[07:23:07] <arthurvr> depends
[07:23:16] <arthurvr> you still need it?
[07:24:00] <Yatekii> well depends on your answers to my questions about non-js/js :D
[07:24:22] <arthurvr> If you don’t need js to do it, don’t do it using js
[07:24:26] <arthurvr> that’s the only right answer
[07:24:40] <Yatekii> hmk
[07:25:13] <Yatekii> but I guess you can do everything without js except for animations (and even that is possible with css) :D
[07:25:41] <arthurvr> no you can’t. I mean, are you planning to do more in that snippet?
[07:25:46] <arthurvr> like validation or so?
[07:25:50] <arthurvr> if not no need to do it in js
[07:26:29] <Yatekii> I can do validation in python ;)
[07:26:33] <Yatekii> and that's what I do too
[07:26:41] <Yatekii> but dynamic search would be nice later on
[07:26:50] <arthurvr> Yatekii: so you don’t want any client-side validation?
[07:27:05] <arthurvr> Yatekii: Why wouldn’t you do it?
[07:28:41] <Yatekii> arthurvr: hmm I could would be smart hmm
[07:29:42] <Yatekii> but why client-side validation if I can have it as slick server side?
[07:30:16] <arthurvr> I, to be honest, don’t want to have this hole discussion right now. We did this enough in here :-)
[07:31:08] <Yatekii> well dunno what all the guys have against it :( because I am really interested in how and why but ok :)
[07:31:42] <Ilhami> seriously yahoo query language makes me happy :)
[07:31:51] <Yatekii> like if you just come with the same arguments over and over again and if they're just dumb like "because I hate java" then ok, but In my case I really dont know :)
[07:32:16] <arthurvr> We don’t have anything against it, you need server-side validation anyway to be save, but there are defenitly good points to have it client side too
[07:32:41] <Ilhami> Server side validation is important. Client side is good for usability.
[07:33:16] <Yatekii> well might be
[07:33:32] <arthurvr> That sentence just is it, however I’ll put in the accessibility argument of html5 validation too
[07:33:52] <Ilhami> but html5 validation is not supported by all browsers, right?
[07:34:29] <arthurvr> of course that depends on what support you need
[07:34:36] <arthurvr> but in fact it’s really good supported
[07:34:48] <Ilhami> cool!
[07:35:01] <arthurvr> things like this http://html5please.com/#type= are all well supported
[07:35:15] <Yatekii> I don't support old shit :)
[07:35:28] <Yatekii> (In this case ofc.)
[07:36:11] <arthurvr> for me mostly IE10+ these days
[07:36:28] <Yatekii> whaaaaaat
[07:36:36] <arthurvr> what whaaaat?
[07:36:53] <Yatekii> IE ... I need garlic and a crucifix right now :P
[07:36:59] <Yatekii> jk
[07:37:17] <Ilhami> I think IE8+ should be supported maybe.
[07:37:19] <arthurvr> IE isn’t the worst these days
[07:37:37] <Ilhami> Nah it isn't.
[07:37:56] <arthurvr> Ilhami: IE8 is a problem indeed
[07:38:15] <arthurvr> but isn’t this the moment in time we all drop IE8? come-on.
[07:38:48] <Sal> can i have more than 1 $(window).scroll(function () {...}) on the same .js file?
[07:39:10] <arthurvr> of course
[07:39:17] <Sal> strange
[07:39:23] <arthurvr> but multiple handlers are really bad perf-wise
[07:39:27] <Sal> seems that only the first one gets attention
[07:39:37] <arthurvr> with many statements you’ll get stuck in infinity
[07:39:38] <Sal> i put a break into thesecond and it never stops
[07:41:04] <arthurvr> Sal: As I said, really bad perf-wise
[07:41:08] <Ilhami> Sal, make one function
[07:41:23] <arthurvr> That still isn’t a fix for the main problem
[07:41:25] <Ilhami> and instead of writing the same code twice.
[07:41:38] <Ilhami> you don't want duplicateed code
[07:41:42] <Sal> yes i know, but for now i'm just trying a copy&paste pf a piece of code to make subheaders stick on top of a list
[07:41:56] <Sal> and ti has a scroll listener
[07:42:04] <Sal> and i already have mine too
[07:42:09] <arthurvr> It’s not about duplicate code, about staying modular
[07:42:22] <arthurvr> multiple handlers are perfectly fine
[07:42:31] <Ilhami> arthurvr, I always think you should think twice if you have to copy/paste.
[07:43:05] <arthurvr> Ilhami: of course. But the code should stay modular too
[07:43:18] <arthurvr> you shouldn’t drop everything in one handler (and resulting in one file)
[07:43:40] <Ilhami> well no objection here :)
[07:43:57] <Ilhami> you are the expert, not me.
[07:45:17] <arthurvr> I’m not. Btw, if we’re talking about just a simple one page app, bump it into one function man
[07:45:19] <Sal> hey guys, this is the piece of code http://i.imgur.com/liaNFqt.png
[07:45:36] <Sal> is it possible that it breaks only when i stop scrolling and return to top?
[07:45:43] <Sal> very strange to me
[07:46:00] <arthurvr> why are you handling this using a callback?
[07:46:27] <arthurvr> but that’s a nitpick :-)
[07:46:38] <arthurvr> might be upstream bug always
[07:46:47] <Sal> arthurvr, as i said, its not mine. its from gere http://codepen.io/chrissp26/pen/gBrdo
[07:47:04] <arthurvr> Sal: let me take a look :-)
[07:47:30] <Sal> arthurvr, what about looking at it on my pc?
[07:47:41] <Sal> so you can see my mess
[07:47:43] <Sal> hehehe
[07:48:25] <arthurvr> Sal: what do you mean by looking at your pc?
[07:48:28] <arthurvr> Sal: hha
[07:48:41] <Sal> connecting to my pc
[07:48:59] <arthurvr> nah man, don’t really have the time right now
[07:49:16] <Sal> no problem
[07:49:40] <Sal> i just can't get it, why does it work online and not in my code
[07:49:58] <arthurvr> to be honest, about the codepen you posted, I don’t really get why doing it like that
[07:50:23] <Sal> i couldn't afind any other
[07:50:24] <Sal> damn
[07:50:33] <Sal> i need subheaders to stick
[07:50:49] <Sal> i only found headers
[07:51:06] <arthurvr> well that’s just to combine stuff right?
[07:51:52] <baako> hi guys. I am using a framework called foundation css which using javascript to do some other funky things such as drop down menu.
[07:52:05] <baako> here is the code
[07:52:07] <baako> http://kopy.io/mv98Z
[07:52:08] <arthurvr> sal: eg http://jsfiddle.net/HbVte/85/
[07:52:23] <Sal> arthurvr, also, my data comes from a db, so i'm using a table and not divs or ul
[07:52:23] <arthurvr> sal: easy to combine that
[07:52:30] <baako> same as my project nav but the drop down doesn't work
[07:52:33] <baako> why?
[07:52:43] <arthurvr> sal: well than bump your code into the page differently
[07:52:54] <baako> i believe the issue is with <script>
[07:52:54] <baako>       $(document).foundation();
[07:52:55] <baako>     </script>
[07:53:01] <arthurvr> sal: you shouldn’t use tables for stuff like this
[07:53:24] <Sal> why?
[07:53:37] <Sal> oh, you mean for the headers
[07:53:46] <arthurvr> sal: It isn’t semantic, less accessable
[07:53:58] <arthurvr> sal: and in general a PITA
[07:55:37] <Sal> if you don't want to use flexbox and table-cell, i think its the only way to show a lor of records on screen
[07:56:22] <arthurvr> sal: it isn’t. Only tabular should be in tables.
[07:56:23] <arthurvr> Do you mean you’re server is just directly returning a table in html?
[07:56:38] <Sal> yes, i just put it inside a div
[07:57:06] <AcidRain2012> lol. #java channel has alot of assholes in it.
[07:57:07] <Sal> its a bubch of records with 4 columns each
[07:57:12] <AcidRain2012> i was only there for 2min
[07:57:23] <arthurvr> AcidRain2012: many channels have many jerks
[07:57:29] <AcidRain2012> i hate it when those types of jerks take over a channel
[07:57:32] <Sal> and the records are grouped and there is a <tr> with colspan on it that contains the group header
[07:59:45] <Sal> luckily the header is in <tr><td colspane"5"><div>Header</div></td></tr>
[07:59:54] <Sal> so with that div, i could stick it
[07:59:55] <arthurvr> Sal: That’s what I mean, that’s not tabular data. But let’s not let the discussion reach till there. IMHO it’s for the web community it’s clear we don’t use tables for this kinds of stuff anymore.
[08:00:36] <AcidRain2012> arthurvr, you would have just been flamed in #java for using 'imho' :P
[08:00:49] <AcidRain2012> just saying.
[08:01:16] <arthurvr> AcidRain2012: let’s join that channel and try it out :-)
[08:01:26] <AcidRain2012> lol
[08:01:44] <AcidRain2012> im in channel <3
[08:02:01] <arthurvr> haha :) are we going to really try it?
[08:02:15] <Sal> arthurvr, <ul> ? <div> ?
[08:02:21] <AcidRain2012> oh... nah. lol. i dont want to be ban from them. i may need them
[08:02:33] <AcidRain2012> i left again ;p
[08:02:36] <arthurvr> lol
[08:02:56] <arthurvr> Sal: depends on the kind of content
[08:03:07] <arthurvr> Sal: just make sure it’s semantic
[08:03:37] <Sal> i think its impossible if you want to keep the ie<9 compatibility
[08:04:04] <Sal> because you'll need to use table-cell stuff or flexbox
[08:04:09] <arthurvr> Sal: being semantic has nothing to do with browser features
[08:04:28] <arthurvr> Sal: that’s what I mean, you shouldn’t use those (see the demo i posted earlier)
[08:05:58] <Sal> what do you think about this one: http://polarblau.github.io/stickySectionHeaders/
[08:06:13] <arthurvr> looks at least better
[08:07:13] <Sal> yes
[08:07:20] <Sal> but list is 1 column
[08:07:22] <Sal> :)
[08:07:46] <arthurvr> well then, just give it two columns
[08:08:08] <arthurvr> that’s not a problem, it’s just javascript, you can give it two container elements
[08:34:29] <martin-_-> hi im trying this example http://mkoryak.github.io/floatThead/examples/window-scrolling/ but pageTop is not defined!
[08:34:36] <martin-_-> whats that variable about?
[08:35:20] <Yatekii> arthurvr: https://bpaste.net/show/974a8c0ee6bf can you help me? :S
[08:36:05] <arthurvr> what’s going wrong, Yatekii! I’d love to help but don’t really have much time now
[08:37:19] <Yatekii> arthurvr: it's written in the paste, but basically when I use sibling(n) to get just a certain one my form somehow gets submitted. if I use siblings().val() it has no value but the form doesnt get triggered (as expected)
[08:37:25] <Yatekii> how is that?
[08:39:04] <arthurvr> I’m not able to help you out at the moment, maybe somebody else?
[08:39:34] <Yatekii> np :)
[08:39:43] <Yatekii> I will try on my own; will be hard :D
[08:39:56] <martin-_-> why is there no demo application for floatThead ?
[08:47:53] <Yatekii> arthurvr: works great now ;)
[10:29:03] <arthurvr> Hi guys! silent today
[10:33:52] <BillCriswell> arthurvr: Thanks for semi-colon notes haha
[10:34:13] <arthurvr> BillCriswell: haha! I was going throught it and :-)
[10:35:30] <BillCriswell> I need to use github more.
[10:35:48] <arthurvr> I use github all day long :-)
[10:36:33] <BillCriswell> I mostly post issues, rarely push code.
[10:37:14] <arthurvr> BillCriswell: open-source is something beautiful
[10:37:52] <BillCriswell> Yeah, I'm just finally getting a little more comfortable with git so I'll be doing more in the future I'm sure.
[10:38:10] <Getty> github is my work central
[10:38:22] <Getty> i got a pay account, all my customer projects in private repos... anything goes there
[10:38:31] <Getty> even tho many customer stuff is opensource anyway ;) so that stacks anyway
[10:38:41] <arthurvr> I use github both for professional work and open-source
[10:39:22] <Getty> its also funny, i use the same 10 private repos limit all time, cause its like rotating, i always got "dead" projects which i just pack on the backup and delete the repo on github ;)
[10:39:56] <arthurvr> Getty: I generally don’t delete repos (even private ones), you lose all issues and PRs
[10:40:29] <arthurvr> Getty: having the history can be really handy when trying to figure out why things are done like things are done
[10:40:34] <BillCriswell> We have our own git server at work, recently switched from svn and it's be going awesome so far.
[10:41:22] <Getty> arthurvr: as if my customer do those there ;) hehe you are funny ;)
[10:41:41] <Getty> arthurvr: i still have the git repo, i mean its git, the local version is full and that is backed up
[10:41:53] <Getty> arthurvr: so i could repush all that back if i want to.... but never needed actually
[10:42:04] <arthurvr> Getty: Mine do. Nothing gets in master without a PR and a review
[10:43:04] <Getty> well i dont pr and review my own code ;-)
[10:43:25] <Getty> would be funny, and then in the comments dialogue with myself!
[10:43:43] <Getty> it would reflect my level of insanity, tho ;)
[10:43:49] <arthurvr> You guys don’t do any code reviews (from other people)?
[10:44:09] <arthurvr> Getty: so many things people don’t catch
[10:44:14] <Getty> on the opensource projects, yeah sure, but i dont have collaborators on the private projects, thats what i say
[10:44:41] <arthurvr> Getty: Agreed. Still I think even with 2 colabs code reviews are worth it.
[10:44:51] <Getty> if i have 2, yeah sure ;)
[10:45:10] <Getty> but i am so good! i can do it all alone! (is one way to put it)
[10:45:26] <arthurvr> haha :-)
[10:45:52] <arthurvr> What open source are you guys collaborating to these days?
[10:46:01] <Getty> whatever is needed
[10:46:04] <Getty> changes daily
[10:46:27] <Getty> its like.... if you work with it you are automatically part of that team somehow if you know how to collaborate
[10:46:29] <BillCriswell> My helping out here and in some project issues on github is about the only thing I do.
[10:46:48] <BillCriswell> I'm enjoying Vue a lot.
[10:46:53] <Getty> BillCriswell: well thats not "only", thats what we need
[10:47:08] <BillCriswell> Getty: I just never feel like I'm doing enough.
[10:47:14] <Getty> especially the outside views and people complaining about things noone complained before, are always the most valueable additions
[10:47:19] <arthurvr> That’s what we need, but a PR here and there is nice
[10:47:20] <arthurvr> haha
[10:47:22] <Getty> think about it this way....
[10:47:32] <BillCriswell> I like to think I create a pretty awesome example of problems.
[10:47:43] <Getty> i know people who added thousands of lines of code to their project just because someone made a comment, an idea that he missed out
[10:47:57] <Getty> you didnt made much, but this little "help" unblocked the developer to release that massive change
[10:48:02] <Getty> every bit counts
[10:48:07] <arthurvr> yes of course :-)
[10:48:24] <Getty> i often also leave vague issue reports
[10:48:48] <arthurvr> vague issue reports are mostly bad issue reports. Issue reports should be detailed
[10:48:55] <Getty> not detailed out if i have no time, i dont expect people to react on them, but i know they got the info
[10:48:58] <Getty> yeah
[10:49:03] <Getty> but better a vague one as none
[10:49:29] <Getty> i dont expect people to fix based on that, as i might have workaround it, but at least i tell them that something was itchy
[10:49:42] <arthurvr> vague issue reports is IMHO wasting developers time
[10:50:19] <Getty> i often comment them with the comment that the situation is no current issue for me anymore and he dosnt need to react but i could give more info later in time
[10:50:34] <arthurvr> A good bug report just takes 2 minutes more, and might directly get fixed (which is also a pro for you)
[10:50:43] <Getty> haha......
[10:50:48] <Getty> yes in many cases, yes
[10:50:52] <Getty> in some cases not ;)
[10:50:59] * Getty is right now making ARM development....
[10:51:16] <Getty> i work on the fork of the fork of the main project branch of the mainlib i use
[10:51:21] <Getty> nuff said ;)
[10:51:32] <Getty> reality can be brutal
[10:51:39] <arthurvr> :-)
[10:52:01] <Getty> if you find a bug in the fork of the fork, there is really no good way to make a good bug report as you just show towards the fork of fork code
[10:52:02] <Getty> and so on...y
[10:52:07] <Getty> you get where i am coming from
[10:52:15] <Getty> thats not "2 minutes" to fizzle that clean
[10:52:59] <Getty> oh and the guy of the fork just says "thats not actual for use code, thats my personal fork" ;-)
[10:53:08] <Getty> so i cant report him anything at all
[10:53:16] <Getty> but i need that code as its the working one 8-)
[10:53:23] <Getty> AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH 8-)
[10:54:05] <arthurvr> than I would say that project has a bad maintainer :-)
[10:54:17] <Getty> its a hardware project, maintaining is NOT easy
[10:54:21] <Getty> you cant "check" easily
[10:54:33] <Getty> there is like 95% of hardware in the project that you dont have
[10:54:38] <Getty> there is noone with 100% of all hardware for testing
[10:54:46] <Getty> especially cause of different board setups and so many variants
[10:54:58] <Getty> its impossible to cover a code change as "approved" easily
[10:55:18] <Getty> its not like you can sit down, review them and done, you must be sure that the other hardware (you cant test) also doesnt choke on the change
[10:55:44] <arthurvr>  yeah - never been envolved with hardware open sourciness
[10:55:46] <Getty> all the process is just slower... much much slower... as you are used to on "pure software" stuff
[10:55:58] <Getty> working with hardware is a mess
[10:55:59] <Getty> i mean think about
[10:56:13] <Getty> "oh we need a new chip for what we want, we dont have that chip, so we have to wait 3-4 days for the delivery"
[10:56:37] <Getty> "oh that new chipo requires us to make a new board, fuck, that cost 50 EUR as prototype ordered and takes 10-14 days or we pay 100 EUR to have it in 6-7 days"
[10:56:57] <Getty> also this fun of COMPLETLY making something ready for Chip A
[10:57:01] <Getty> the COMPLTE project logic
[10:57:10] <Getty> and then see, that it doesnt work cause of problems we wouldnt be able to saw before
[10:57:14] <Getty> BACK TO 0!
[10:57:37] <Getty> i mean of course you take over half the logic, b ut its just annoying to start from scratch probably switch main libs
[10:57:52] <Getty> when we switched (inside a project) from ATXMEGA to ARM.... it was a total 0
[10:58:05] <Getty> total new equipment, new processes, anything starts at 0
[10:58:13] <arthurvr> agreed
[10:59:00] <Getty> but you get used to it, its just a new part in the formula you have
[10:59:09] <Getty> it just takes away so much... of the speed we have as developer
[10:59:19] <Getty> we can make gold out of shit in minutes
[10:59:27] <Getty> but not with hardware...... even if you are a jedi
[10:59:54] <Getty> OH OH... and NEVER EVER underestimate the casing
[11:00:03] <Getty> write that down as rule 1 in the book
[11:02:25] <Getty> oh i should remind: working so bare on the C level forces you to think 100% different, all your concepts of software development are 100% worthless..... anything is "raw"
[11:07:05] <aro> does anyone know if it is possible to have 3 sortable lists replicated?
[11:12:58] <SomeT> hi
[11:13:12] <SomeT> how do I make all my console logs print to the web page instead?
[11:13:13] <SomeT> view-source:http://aglowo.com/core.php
[11:13:30] <SomeT> innerhtml or something?
[11:13:43] <arthurvr> you mean to overwrite console.log with document.write?
[11:14:01] <SomeT> so I basically just write document.write in place?
[11:14:10] <arthurvr> yeah
[11:14:17] <SomeT> thanks
[11:14:18] <arthurvr> that will get logged to the page
[11:14:31] <arthurvr> but won’t work in various envs
[11:14:46] <arthurvr> general rule of thumb is to not use it for production
[11:15:10] <arthurvr> use things like $(”elem”).text(”my message”)
[11:16:25] <SomeT> I just doing it for a prototype
[11:16:30] <SomeT> based on chrome/android
[11:16:40] <SomeT> I am only displaying basic text as well
[11:23:52] <SomeT> ok so document .write wipes off most my stuff on the main page
[11:23:55] <SomeT> the actualy script
[11:24:34] <arthurvr> then use $(el).text()
[11:26:17] <SomeT> how?
[11:33:04] <aro> with sortable/draggable, can you restrict it from being dropped to a certain list
[11:53:28] <ioann> good day! is it possible after var p=$('.some');  to make something like $().find(p, "my_next_query") ???  (to find IN  p)
[11:55:30] <arthurvr> ioann: why not $(p).find(”my query”)
[11:56:14] <arthurvr> ioann: whoops just p.find(”my query”)
[11:57:23] <ioann> OMG it Works!!! Thank You so much!
[11:57:32] <arthurvr> you’re welcome!
[12:04:49] <Getty> arthurvr: oh i am right now just reminded of the advantage of hardware development (as end project development): just one fucking arch and hardware situation to think about ;)
[12:17:12] <ioann> p.find(”my query”) works, but p[0].find("query") does not ((  what shell we do??
[12:17:40] <arthurvr> $(p[0]).find("query")
[12:17:44] <arthurvr> is what you need
[12:18:06] <arthurvr> or use p.first().find(”query”)
[12:20:26] <systemfault> or p.eq(0).find....
[12:20:39] <arthurvr> yup
[12:22:08] <BillCriswell> or p.slice(0,1).find('query')
[12:22:32] <arthurvr> come-on guys, there must be more possibilities
[12:22:47] <BillCriswell> or.... p.next().prev().find('query')
[12:23:26] <systemfault> $("my query", $(p[0]))?
[12:23:31] <ioann> Thanx man! it works)) and what is the most general way to find in object or array, ... $(our_obj).find()?
[12:25:59] <BillCriswell> ioann: in an actual array or object?
[12:26:25] <ioann> or $("query", obj) and $(obj).find("query") are equivalents and this is for any case?
[12:26:41] <systemfault> Yes.
[12:26:59] <ioann> )) good
[12:27:13] <ioann> yes for any var we have.
[12:27:28] <systemfault> Pretty much nobody uses $(selector, root) thogh
[12:27:31] <systemfault> *though
[12:27:44] <systemfault> We all use .find

[13:07:24] <Azrael_-> hi
[13:08:37] <Azrael_-> http://pastebin.com/qsRUkNUn <-- i'm adding a table row here but the value of 'ean' is NULL. what would be the best option to display a ' ' instead of the null if the value is null?
[14:00:17] <stangeland> if i load an img by setting the src attribute, then another by changing the src attribute again, and after that i set src attribute to the first value again. Is the first image then loaded 2 times from server or is it cached locally? what are the rules for image caching in the browser?
[14:23:46] <djam90> You know how in AngularJS you can use ng-options to pre-fill a select box with data. Is there a non-Angular way to do this with some plugin or something?
[14:24:01] <djam90> Writing it in raw jQuery / JS seems tedious
[14:24:22] <djam90> I want to be able to do options.renderSelectBox() and BOOM it adds it in the DOM
[14:25:34] <wa5ted_> could wite a function
[14:25:36] <wa5ted_> that you call
[14:25:38] <wa5ted_> djam90:
[14:25:39] <wa5ted_> ^
[14:26:36] <djam90> wa5ted_, yeah I guess. But that wouldn't be very flexible I guess
[14:26:47] <wa5ted_> not necessarily
[14:26:52] <wa5ted_> i mean you could give the function
[14:26:57] <wa5ted_> what dom element to target etc.

[16:10:34] <sdwrage> Hey all. Anyone know a good plugin that stick an element to the side of another element?
[16:10:43] <sdwrage> need it for a menu that expands and collapses
[16:11:57] <robertmaxrees> do you have an example?
[16:12:08] <robertmaxrees> like on another site?
[16:14:11] <sdwrage> not really.
[16:14:21] <sdwrage> basically I need an element to follow the other element
[16:14:26] <sdwrage> and stick to its right side
[16:14:33] <robertmaxrees> you can do that with html/css
[16:14:48] <robertmaxrees> if i'm envisioning what you want, at least.
[16:16:02] <sdwrage> well the collapsable element is in a bootstrap three grid column
[16:16:15] <sdwrage> it expands over the right content
[16:17:33] <robertmaxrees> without seeing your markup/current site, I'd say you need to look at css positioning and z-index
[16:17:57] <sdwrage> okay thanks
[16:36:22] <usinganalias> Why, when you create new todo list items here (http://jsfiddle.net/6qxk9m9n/) can they not be deleted by clicking on them?
[16:36:34] <usinganalias> Thanks all!
[16:37:10] <robertmaxrees> because the event binding isn't bound do things that dosn't xist.
[16:37:12] <robertmaxrees> *exist.
[16:37:17] <robertmaxrees> check out event delegation.
[16:39:51] <usinganalias> That makes sense - thanks!
[16:41:37] <usinganalias> I updated the code (http://jsfiddle.net/6qxk9m9n/1/) but the reference to $(this) now points to the <ul> - what’s the best way to get the clicked li when using event delegation?
[16:41:37] <robertmaxrees> so like this http://jsfiddle.net/6qxk9m9n/2/
[16:41:54] <robertmaxrees> that's not the right way to use delegation - see my example.
[16:42:14] <usinganalias> robertmaxrees - how come my version doesn’t work?
[16:42:29] <robertmaxrees> becuase that's not a valid syntax for event delegatuion.
[16:42:41] <usinganalias> Is the ‘on’ function required?
[16:42:45] <robertmaxrees> yes.
[16:42:52] <robertmaxrees> .click() actually uses .on() under the hood.
[16:43:10] <usinganalias> sweet - how come jQuery doesn’t allow event delegation through .click()?
[16:43:14] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/click/ you can see all the method signatues of .click() here - notice that yours isn't in here :)
[16:43:20] <robertmaxrees> because that wouldn't be very clear.
[16:43:46] <usinganalias> that makes a bit of sense - thanks!
[16:47:24] <Mark_2> does anybody know where i can find this slider plugin? https://www.dropbox.com/s/rfrgsfua9qxeny0/스크린샷%202015-01-18%2009.46.21.png?dl=0
[16:47:46] <robertmaxrees> the one on adobe's site?
[16:48:30] <robertmaxrees> oh looks like some other site.
[16:48:39] <robertmaxrees> you can open up the page source and look for it.
[16:49:05] <Mark_2> i only have the screenshot.
[16:49:31] <robertmaxrees> no clue then.  you could always use one and customize it.
[16:50:00] <Mark_2> it’s a slider plugin that can control elements to move around
[16:50:06] <Mark_2> anybody have a clue?
[16:50:23] <robertmaxrees> you basically described every carouself out there >.>
[16:50:32] <Mark_2> haha. probably.
[16:50:35] <Mark_2> sorry.
[16:52:40] <robertmaxrees> that carousel was very likely customized from another.
[17:54:14] <sf> hey guys i want this script to run only when i call the function how can i make it happen http://jsfiddle.net/ysjchd2o/
[17:55:45] <sdwrage_> anyone know a jquery plugin that hides sensitive data with asterisks and shows it when you hover over them?
[17:57:15] <sf> maybe this sdwrage_ http://joshbuddy.github.io/spoiler-alert/
[17:59:57] <sdwrage_> sf, harm let me try that out. Thanks :)
[18:12:34] <sdwrage_> sf, yep that works beautifully thanks :)
[18:12:49] <sf> nice
[18:40:29] <Ilhami> assholes. :/ they want to monitor the internet activity even more now!
[19:07:52] <usinganalias> I have a ul with li elements which can fade out when clicked - how do I remove the jerky “snap” when one li element disappears and the ones after it slide up?
[19:14:14] <aro> when using sortable, is there a way to get the target element list?
[19:15:36] <Ilhami> aro, probably.
[19:17:02] <sammich> aro: http://api.jqueryui.com/sortable/ check the events available
[20:25:18] <jesmith> I want to add an input box to an element as part of the sortable receive event. But when I do it via $(ui.item).append(), it adds the content to the source of the item, not the dropped one
[23:55:43] <Blinky_> Morning all, anyone around?
[23:56:41] <Blinky_> I need to change my script to allow both letters and the shift key.  Could someone please have a look and help a beginner? - http://pastie.org/9837975
