[02:35:33] <Duikb00t> close or over?
[02:35:44] <Duikb00t> over  div or over a diff?
[02:48:04] <Cork> he's long gone
[02:48:16] <Cork> would have asked if i was still here
[05:18:36] <iamarun> please tell me is my code ok ! or needs more improvement https://pastebin.com/i7rqswXJ
[05:29:15] <props> how to change className looking for data attribute "data-filter"  --> return re.test(el.className);  to --> return re.test(el.attr('data-filter'));
[05:29:44] <Cork> props: you need to provide context
[05:30:12] <props> Cork: https://codepen.io/desandro/pen/JLBdv
[05:31:34] <props> this one is looking ClassNames in html, like "<div class="item level-expert category-football frequency-two distance-half-marathon">"
[05:32:15] <props> I have change class to data-attribute like this: <div data-filter="item level-expert category-football frequency-two distance-half-marathon">
[05:33:01] <props> so now I have to change it look for my "data-filter" instead of "class"
[05:34:07] <props> there where my problem is, how to make isotope look for "data-filter"
[05:34:21] <props> instead of "classNames"
[08:49:06] <rizonz> hi guys, is it possible to set multiple options like dateformat, regional in a datepicker at once ?
[08:50:10] <Cork> rizonz: you can set it when you initialize the widget
[09:01:03] <rizonz> Cork: yes but I onlyu see one option set in the examples, not multiple
[09:10:59] <Cork> rizonz: every example except the first one has more then one option ex. http://jqueryui.com/datepicker/#other-months
[09:12:08] <rizonz> Cork: I was checking the API docs
[09:12:40] <Cork> well it takes an object so you can specify how many you want
[09:21:15] <rizonz> Cork: yeah I also can do stuff like $(this).attr()... and add stuff on it like that
[09:21:32] <Cork> that isn't options though
[09:21:42] <rizonz> no but I see that now :)
[09:50:06] <rizonz> when I have a function like this: initDatePicker : function() { .... } can I simply pass variable into it ?
[09:50:10] <rizonz> **variables
[09:50:26] <rizonz> sounds a basic question but I' reviewing code which is not mine and need to check some things
[09:50:35] <rizonz> and I' not a 100% JS guy :)
[09:51:18] <Cork> depends on the project
[09:51:30] <Cork> as that is a project structure not something jquery enforces
[09:52:47] <rizonz> mhh ok, what would be my options then ? I mean... there are hardcoded datepicker options here which I want to make flexible using a variable like 'country' and base it all on an if
[09:53:18] <Cork> rizonz: the best option is to talk with the one that wrote the code your looking at
[09:53:41] <Cork> cause noone else can really say how it is structured
[09:53:52] <Cork> ppl can read parts of it and guess, but... ya
[09:53:58] <rizonz> Cork: I' pretty sure he doesn't want to talk :S
[09:54:34] <Cork> then i would recommend start reading though the project so you understand it, and don't start modifying something in the middle until you do
[09:55:35] <rizonz> yes I already did, but I just wondered about that... I have some other options by doing it on classname and check for an attribute with the classname
[09:56:11] <Cork> from the question you just asked it is quite clear you don't know how the project stick together, cause that would be one of the first thing you would have to understand
[09:56:47] <Cork> giving a property in an unknown object and asking if you can pass options to is, depends on how that function is called
[09:57:02] <Cork> so you would have to find that place and read it
[09:57:25] <Cork> and then modify the change from where it makes sense to set the value up to where the picker is initialized
[09:57:29] <rizonz> Cork: that function is just calles/initialized, nothing more
[09:57:31] <Cork> *chain*
[09:58:02] <Cork> rizonz: "is just calles"??
[09:58:26] <Cork> if you know where the function is called from and that is where you want to pass parameters, then just do that
[09:58:28] <rizonz> *called, typo
[09:58:56] <Cork> my point is, it isn't something anyone can help you with except by reading through the project
[09:59:35] <rizonz> Cork: nah I was more asking myself, can I put variables into that function, nothing more :)
[10:06:40] <rizonz> Cork: I have been through the whole project already, it was a mess on PHP and JS, I have fixed lots of JS things but the way data comes into functions in JS is kinda weird from time to time
[10:16:58] <dnscat> is it possible to call getContext('2d') on a jquery element?
[10:17:16] <taplar> it that a dom method?
[10:18:29] <taplar> yeah.  so just break out of the jQuery object with $()[0] or $().get(0) and then you can call getContext off of that
[10:19:08] <dnscat> .get(0) eh?
[10:19:11] <dnscat> k I'll try that
[10:19:27] <taplar> get(#) gets the dom node at that indexz
[10:19:45] <taplar> same with [0] since jQuery objects are "array like"
[10:20:16] <dnscat> ohhh nice
[10:20:20] <dnscat> it worked, btw
[10:20:36] <taplar> i know, :P
[10:21:14] <dnscat> lol
[10:21:16] <dnscat> fair enough.
[10:24:50] <codecutter> do i need setTimeout for mouseenter and mouseleave events?
[10:25:05] <taplar> i wouldn't think so
[10:25:21] <taplar> unless you have some use case for it
[10:26:02] <codecutter> i'm using it to prevent repeat
[10:27:03] <codecutter> e.g. when i hover text, i have a popup that appends and displays, i'm using setTimeout to prevent multiple appends and displays
[10:27:26] <codecutter> i'm not sure if this is redunant
[10:28:01] <codecutter> redundant*
[10:28:26] <taplar> you're undoing the append and display on mouse leave?
[10:28:47] <codecutter> i'm doing remove() on mouseleave and append on mousenter
[10:29:12] <codecutter> does mousenter for children() too?
[10:29:12] <taplar> so in what case were you seeing multiple appends?
[10:29:22] <codecutter> does mousenter fire for* children() too?
[10:29:33] <taplar> i would think so
[10:30:07] <codecutter> then i need setTimeout, becuase it should fire only once, not when scroll the children
[10:30:16] <codecutter> scrolling*
[10:30:18] <codecutter> right*
[10:30:22] <codecutter> right?
[10:30:24] <taplar> i mean every element would get a mouse enter/leave event, it just depends on if that bubbles up to the parent and is handled by it's handler
[10:30:55] <taplar> and if that's a problem you could check the e.target to see if it is the parent or a child of the parent
[10:31:05] <taplar> if it's a mouse enter of a child of the parent, ignore
[10:31:10] <taplar> same with a mouse leave
[10:34:36] <codecutter> one more thing...
[10:39:32] <codecutter> when I hover over some text, the popup appears at the bottom (appeneding as a sibling), problem is, it not sivisle if the scroller is at the bottom of the page. How do i fix this so that it appears above the text when there is not enough space at the bottom and vice versa?
[10:39:35] <codecutter> make sense?
[10:40:36] <taplar> so i assume you have it with a position fixed or something that is causing it to go off the bottom of the page?
[10:40:44] <taplar> or absolute or whatever
[10:41:37] <codecutter> how do i make dynamic e.g. page sensitive
[10:41:44] <codecutter> make it*
[10:42:00] <codecutter> scroll sensitive, rather..
[10:42:36] <codecutter> position: absolute;
[10:42:39] <taplar> you might have to ask ##javascript about that.  logically you'd need to check the y position of the popup, add the height of the popup, and see if that value is > than the height of the viewport.  And if it is adjust.
[10:42:41] <codecutter> your right
[10:42:59] <codecutter> ok
[11:02:18] <mikunos> Hi guys is there a way to split a list of div into groups rewriting the html by jQuery? https://jsfiddle.net/mikunos/6grqjp2h/
[11:03:14] <taplar> split how?
[11:04:56] <mikunos> hi taplar, in this way: http://pix.toile-libre.org/upload/original/1510329879.png
[11:05:27] <taplar> ok, sure, but your markup is a pretty big wall of text
[11:05:37] <taplar> what about the divs tells me where it should be split?
[11:06:10] <taplar> the option label perhaps?
[11:06:19] <mikunos> the first word of the option-label attribute
[11:06:27] <mikunos> yes
[11:06:36] <taplar> k
[11:06:59] <mikunos> There are 2 types Standard, Laquered, and other types
[11:07:16] <taplar> so you can group them like that
[11:07:23] <mikunos> exact
[11:07:26] <taplar> one sec and i'll get something started
[11:08:20] <mikunos> ok
[11:12:07] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/6grqjp2h/2/
[11:12:52] <taplar> this logic loops over the options, and puts them into an object by key matching what their label is
[11:13:12] <mikunos> taplar I cannot see any splitted list
[11:13:21] <taplar> it's not changing the markup
[11:13:28] <taplar> open your browser console to see the result
[11:13:41] <taplar> you can take that result and manipulate the page however you want
[11:13:59] <mikunos> ohhh thanks!
[11:14:36] <mikunos> so now I have to loop the lists
[11:15:24] <mikunos> https://jsfiddle.net/mikunos/6grqjp2h/3/
[11:16:06] <taplar> You can use Object.keys(results).forEach(function(label){ var elements = results[label]; /* do stuff with elements */ });
[11:17:12] <mikunos> ok let me see it
[11:18:19] <mikunos> Error: $ is not defined
[11:18:29] <mikunos> I have not set the jQuery
[11:18:38] <mikunos> where do you set it up?
[11:18:49] <taplar> in the fiddle?
[11:18:53] <mikunos> yes
[11:19:09] <taplar> in the bottom left area you should see  "Javascript" label in the top right.  click that
[11:19:26] <mikunos> https://jsfiddle.net/mikunos/6grqjp2h/4/
[11:20:06] <mikunos> https://jsfiddle.net/mikunos/6grqjp2h/4/#&togetherjs=vLVzw03UVG
[11:20:14] <taplar> we don't really do togethers in here
[11:20:23] <mikunos> oh ok
[11:20:43] <taplar> so look up at the Object.keys logic i gave and see what you can do with that
[11:21:22] <mikunos> ok found it
[11:21:47] <taplar> brb
[11:21:52] <mikunos> thanks!
[12:56:39] <jonfatino> Anyone help me out? I am a bit new. Working on a script that is basic table edit / display.  When I click edit it only fills out the first 3 items and doesn't reder the rest of the data. https://pastebin.com/raw/LuNMKmmU
[12:57:38] <taplar> make a fiddle please
[12:58:33] <mikunos> taplar at the end I'm stalled myself with the js code
[12:59:01] <mikunos> https://jsfiddle.net/mikunos/6grqjp2h/17/
[12:59:34] <taplar> how would like 16 ever be true?
[12:59:55] <mikunos> ???
[13:00:08] <taplar> you default the variable to ""
[13:00:13] <taplar> "" != null
[13:01:00] <mikunos> I would like to find the start of the group
[13:01:08] <mikunos> in order to split the list
[13:01:16] <mikunos> with two titles
[13:01:18] <jonfatino> I don't think fiddle supports php / mysql as well
[13:01:40] <taplar> jonfatino: jquery just works with the frontend.  you just need to put your generated markup in the fiddle
[13:01:43] <taplar> enough to make it work
[13:01:53] <taplar> mikunos: the start of each group?
[13:02:07] <mikunos> yes the start of each group
[13:02:18] <mikunos> cut the list and add a new title
[13:02:21] <taplar> that would be the first element in the element variable
[13:02:35] <mikunos> exactly
[13:02:47] <taplar> right
[13:02:49] <taplar> ?
[13:03:34] <mikunos> I mean that the big list must be cutted in groups
[13:04:01] <taplar> so you clear the parent that you are going to add all the things to, and then you just start adding your things to it
[13:04:15] <mikunos> exactly
[13:04:18] <taplar> so do that
[13:04:25] <mikunos> re-create a list
[13:04:56] <taplar> you're saying all the things you should do, but you're not saying why you're having trouble doing them, :)
[13:05:13] <mikunos> ... but it is really complicated to create all html items
[13:05:18] <taplar> how so?
[13:05:35] <taplar> break it down into steps
[13:05:48] <mikunos> ok
[13:05:49] <taplar> first, how do you clear the place that you want to build the new data in?
[13:06:10] <mikunos> .html('')
[13:06:28] <taplar> ok, so now idenitify what that place is that you need to do that on, and do it
[13:07:55] <mikunos> this is the item $('.swatch-attribute color').html('')
[13:07:59] <jonfatino> Do they have pre-templated some type of sql table print out with edit delete etc code already out there?
[13:08:09] <taplar> 'they'?
[13:08:20] <mikunos> the code is already there
[13:08:29] <jonfatino> http://phpflow.com/demo/bootgrid-php-mysql-serverside-demo/
[13:08:46] <jonfatino> Looking for something like this but without having to edit a mass amount to add 20 fields on my table
[13:08:47] <taplar> mikunos: I don't see in you're fiddle where you are clearing the area you are going to put the response in
[13:09:02] <mikunos> https://jsfiddle.net/mikunos/6grqjp2h/19/ (line 14)
[13:09:24] <taplar> line 14 is just a loop
[13:09:33] <taplar> nothing about that is doing the html('') eh?
[13:09:36] <mikunos> no no
[13:09:41] <mikunos> there is a line there
[13:09:52] <mikunos> $('.swatch-attribute.color').html('');
[13:10:02] <mikunos> https://jsfiddle.net/mikunos/goz7odov/1/
[13:10:31] <taplar> k, that's a different fiddle than what you shared.  lets see
[13:11:24] <mikunos> if I save the fiddle code the url change
[13:12:48] <taplar> ok, now.  https://jsfiddle.net/goz7odov/2/  look at the console
[13:13:20] <taplar> label is Standard/Lacquered, yes?
[13:13:51] <mikunos> right
[13:14:02] <mikunos> https://jsfiddle.net/mikunos/goz7odov/3/
[13:14:09] <taplar> so it's one step away from: var displayLabel = label +" Color";
[13:14:30] <taplar> no don't clear the input in the loop dude
[13:14:54] <mikunos> ok
[13:15:00] <taplar> and you took the index out of the forEach parameters
[13:15:28] <taplar> but anyway, here's the point
[13:15:52] <taplar> you are emptying the place you are going to put your results to "initialize" it
[13:16:16] <taplar> label has your key, which you can append " Color" to, for your output, so you don't have to grab it from any of the elements.  You already have that.
[13:16:32] <mikunos> ok clear
[13:16:37] <taplar> and elements contains every single color that needs to be in your group, so you don't have to worry about new/old group
[13:16:37] <mikunos> I have created a template
[13:16:46] <mikunos> for the title
[13:16:54] <mikunos> var titletpl = '<span class="swatch-attribute-label">[title]</span><span class="swatch-attribute-selected-option"></span>';
[13:17:02] <mikunos> with a placeholder
[13:17:06] <mikunos> [title]
[13:17:12] <taplar> ok, so you'd to a replace on that to get the title in there
[13:17:41] <taplar> or you could just convert it to dom elements and set the swatch-attribute-label's text
[13:17:55] <taplar> which would also be benificial when you start adding the colors to it
[13:18:18] <mikunos> https://jsfiddle.net/mikunos/goz7odov/4/
[13:19:14] <rizonz> I need to find out how I can add an extra css class to a datepicker, it seems to be static set to "datepicker hasDatepicker"
[13:20:49] <taplar> mikunos: https://jsfiddle.net/goz7odov/5/
[13:21:24] <mikunos>  index is not defined
[13:21:32] <taplar> i took it out, it's not used
[13:22:12] <mikunos> https://jsfiddle.net/goz7odov/6/
[13:22:15] <mikunos> ok done
[13:23:27] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/goz7odov/7/
[13:24:20] <mikunos> thanks taplar
[13:25:28] <taplar> rizonz: do you mean make datepicker add another class, itself, on anything it initializes on?
[13:29:38] <rizonz> taplar: I need something to initilize it on it whatever, I need some identifier to do some indexOf on, but name is not possible in this case as the forms are dynamicly generated
[13:30:06] <rizonz> bbl, my dog needs to go out
[14:17:08] <rizonz> taplar: ok back :)
[14:17:47] <taplar> so are you saying you need to put a class on them before you initialize, so you know what to initialize datapicker on?
[14:18:59] <rizonz> yap
[14:19:21] <taplar> can you not do that as part of the logic that generates them?
[14:19:37] <taplar> them being the forms, from your previous statemtnt
[14:20:10] <rizonz> yes, that should be done but is not done, sounds weird, but the datepicker takes over or so, overwrites, don't know why
[14:21:19] <taplar> what do you mean overwrites?
[14:23:48] <rizonz> taplar: this is how it exists in my HTML <input class="datepicker hasDatepicker" name="activity[main][dateStart]" id="dp1510333515494" type="text">
[14:24:18] <rizonz> the issue there is that my formfield is names dateStart in my form
[14:24:25] <rizonz> *named
[14:25:54] <taplar> hold on, you just said that's how it exists in the HTML.  but then you said it's named differently...
[14:26:22] <rizonz> yap, it' dynamicly created
[14:27:11] <taplar> so the initial page ones are named like the HTML one, and the others are named differently?
[14:27:36] <rizonz> ehhh I think we have a language barrier :)
[14:27:58] <taplar> can you make a fiddle?  might be easier to see the problem
[14:28:06] <rizonz> they are always named like that, so dateStart, dateEnd, whatever I call them in my form.php
[14:28:38] <rizonz> it's generated by zendframework witrh some abstract class so not that easy to fiddle
[14:28:40] <taplar> name="activity[main][dateStart]"   name="activity[main][dateEnd]"
[14:28:43] <taplar> all in that pattern?
[14:28:46] <rizonz> yap
[14:29:07] <taplar> so i don't understand what "the issue there is that my formfield is names dateStart in my form " was supposed to be telling me
[14:30:20] <rizonz> I want to do something like this if ($(this).attr('name').indexOf('dateStart') != -1) { } but then on a class I add to "datepicker hasDatepicker"
[14:30:31] <rizonz> hasDatepicker comes from the jquery lib
[14:31:35] <taplar> do all your names match the pattern "activity[main][???]" ?
[14:40:54] <rizonz> taplar: yesa
[14:40:56] <rizonz> yesa
[14:40:58] <rizonz> daMN
[14:41:00] <rizonz> yes
[14:41:15] <taplar> :)
[14:44:42] <jak2000> hi friends
[14:46:30] <taplar> and taplar
[15:23:18] <rizonz> taplar: what was your idea ?
[15:25:39] <taplar> wouldn't your if be if(this.name === "activity[main][dateStart]") ?
[15:27:31] <rizonz> taplar: my idea was to add some classname where I can check on, which is en_US or whatever and set the datetype based on country or locale
[15:28:30] <taplar> ok.  so I don't really understand the question you are posing to me then
[15:39:38] <rizonz> ok, erm :)
[15:40:07] <rizonz> I need to add some classname to the datePicker, or some identifier where I can check on using indexOf
[15:44:06] <taplar> you wouldn't do indexOf for a class
[15:44:14] <taplar> you'd do $(this).is('.theClass')
[15:44:22] <rizonz> yeah or something else what I can use on it
[17:09:28] <rizonz> where is datePicker triggered on to be loaded ?
[17:09:40] <robertmaxrees> which?
[17:10:13] <rizonz> http://api.jqueryui.com/datepicker
[17:10:15] <rizonz> that one
[17:15:44] <codecutter> is this how its done? https://hastebin.com/ralokibabi.cs (https://popper.js.org/index.html_
[17:15:52] <codecutter> if so why does the popup appear off screen when the scrollbar is at bottom, shouldn't it automatically display upwards? (thats my only reason for using this lib)
[17:16:02] <codecutter> by upwards i mean at the top
[17:19:19] <robertmaxrees> rizonz guess i don't understand the question.
[17:19:32] <codecutter> bruh!
[17:19:54] <robertmaxrees> rizonz do you mean "when does it initialize?"
[17:19:56] <codecutter> check it out
[17:19:59] <codecutter> :)
[17:20:09] <robertmaxrees> codecutter gimme a min duder ;)
[17:20:19] <codecutter> tyt
[17:20:27] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[17:20:38] <taplar> codecutter: did you ask ##javascript about this like i suggested earlier?
[17:20:52] <robertmaxrees> he's in both channels.
[17:21:14] <rizonz> robertmaxrees: yes as I' figuring out why it always load the datepicker here even when I remove the classes from the date formfield
[17:21:16] <codecutter> tapler: they suggested i use a lib (i found popper.js)
[17:21:24] <taplar> k
[17:21:44] <robertmaxrees> rizonz that... doesn't answer my question.
[17:21:45] <codecutter> see above
[17:21:50] <robertmaxrees> codecutter make a fiddle?
[17:21:57] <robertmaxrees> codecutter it's hard to help when we can't see the bug in action.
[17:22:15] <robertmaxrees> rizonz what do you mean by "why it always load the datepicker"
[17:22:29] <codecutter> no bug, i just don't know how to use it :)
[17:22:50] <robertmaxrees> codecutter same diff.
[17:22:51] <robertmaxrees> heh
[17:22:53] <rizonz> robertmaxrees: when I click on my date field I always get the datepicker displayed and also it's CSS is loaded so, something is triggering it
[17:23:39] <robertmaxrees> rizonz usually you have to call the .datepicker method on the input itself.
[17:23:53] <robertmaxrees> pretty sure it doesn't autoinit.
[17:24:28] <robertmaxrees> so make sure you're not targeting that element and calling that method.
[17:26:01] <rizonz> robertmaxrees: yes I' trying but in some way it seems to "load"
[17:26:35] <robertmaxrees> rizonz "load" isn't the term you're looking for.
[17:27:00] <robertmaxrees> "load" means the browser had downloaded the code for it.  if you're inclduing jquery ui, you're likele loading that code.
[17:27:03] <rizonz> robertmaxrees: yeah I know
[17:27:21] <robertmaxrees> it's the initialize you care about.  if it's initializing, something is calling the .datepicker() method.
[17:27:57] <rizonz> yap
[17:28:11] <robertmaxrees> so you need to search your codebase for that.
[17:29:11] <rizonz> yes doing so :)
[17:32:06] <rizonz> robertmaxrees: but what I' curious about is what loads this: <input class="datepicker hasDatepicker" name="activity[main][dateStart]" id="dp1510351724597" type="text">
[17:32:21] <robertmaxrees> uh.
[17:32:21] <robertmaxrees> wat
[17:32:24] <rizonz> and then especially class="datepicker hasDatepicker" as that comes from the jquery lib
[17:33:10] <robertmaxrees> wat[
[17:33:23] <robertmaxrees> rizonz you'r enot making sense.
[17:33:42] <robertmaxrees> those aren't classes from jqui
[17:33:58] <rizonz> hasDatepicker is
[17:34:01] <robertmaxrees> nope.

[17:34:32] <robertmaxrees> wait one sec.
[17:34:38] <rizonz> robertmaxrees: ok 1
[17:35:02] <robertmaxrees> sorry, mixed up my windows.

[17:35:27] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/12m441hn/
[17:35:28] <robertmaxrees> there.
[17:35:34] <robertmaxrees> no datepicker initialization.
[17:36:10] <robertmaxrees> when you initialize it, it does indeed add classes and markup (you were correct about that).
[17:38:49] <rizonz> ok, but can I add some extra css class to that as well ?
[17:38:54] <robertmaxrees> well.
[17:39:00] <robertmaxrees> you can test pretty easily.

[18:00:52] <tobh> is there a method to bind to browser events? i have a web app that relies on ajax to populate various DOM elements, and occassionally (this is sporadic), the browser (Chrome) will experience this error: net::ERR_NAME_NOT_RESOLVED. I'm looking to handle this but I can't seem to find a way to bind to this event, and I'm assuming because it's outside of the DOM, and is actually on the network layer and not the
[18:00:59] <tobh> application layer. Any ideas on how to handle this?
[18:01:48] <taplar> what are you doing when that event happens?
[18:02:00] <taplar> err, to cause that event?
[18:02:38] <tobh> that's part of the problem, i can't force the event to happen. it's a sporadic occurance that can happen after 20 minutes, or after 12 hours.
[18:03:02] <taplar> but is it due to something on the page, or is it something with the browser itself?
[18:03:19] <tobh> it appears to be something with the browser itself.
[18:03:32] <taplar> then that's really outside the realm of javascript
[18:03:49] <tobh> ok, that's what i was afraid of.
[18:42:19] <robert_> so how do you get the http response headers for the page?
[18:42:50] <taplar> from the loaded page, or from an ajax request?
[18:43:32] <robert_> from the loaded page
[18:43:46] <taplar> i'm not sure that you can.  ask ##javascript
[18:43:47] <robert_> I'm passing an XHR token through to the AJAX request
[18:44:11] <taplar> oh, you wouldn't grab the token from the page
[18:44:36] <taplar> you want to set the useCredentials (iirc) to true or something so the browser auto puts them on the ajax request when you make it
[18:45:14] <taplar> withCredentials
[18:45:28] <taplar> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/  search for that on that page
[18:46:57] <taplar> it's actually a security suggestion that server responses should set the httpOnly header so that javascript can't get access to certain request headers for security reasons.
[18:47:17] <robertmaxrees> ^^^^
[18:49:26] <taplar> ran into that not to long ago when our uxers demanded that we expose the token for them
[18:49:39] <taplar> told em, not gonna happen, heh
[18:50:59] <robertmaxrees> O.o
[18:51:01] <robertmaxrees> noooooo
[18:54:04] <taplar> I got it to work, showed them an example, and they left me alone
[18:57:59] <rizonz> is this possible ? initDatePicker : function(id) { }  ?
[18:58:05] <rizonz> so I mean the id
[18:59:11] <taplar> have a great weekend all
[19:01:57] <robertmaxrees> rizonz what are you trying to accomplish?
[19:02:15] <rizonz> robertmaxrees: I need to pass a variable into it and do some if on it
[19:02:31] <robertmaxrees> what will that variable change?
[19:02:37] <rizonz> yes
[19:02:46] <robertmaxrees> that's not a yes/no question lol
[19:02:55] <rizonz> oh!
[19:03:05] <rizonz> I didn't see the what ;)
[19:03:20] <rizonz> it will change the options for the datepicker
[19:03:25] <rizonz> based on country
[19:03:32] <robertmaxrees> you don't need to override the init.
[19:03:42] <robertmaxrees> you can just check the ID in your own initializer.
[19:04:26] <rizonz> yes I do that but it's init without anything passed to it and I would like to do that
[19:04:44] <rizonz> I will get the locale from the data I set in my form
[19:04:52] <robertmaxrees> it's pretty easy to set that up...
[19:04:56] <robertmaxrees> not sure where the disconnect is.
[19:05:02] <robertmaxrees> mind sharing your code via a fiddle?
[19:05:47] <rizonz> I would love it but I'm tracing and it's a lot!
[19:05:56] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[19:06:06] <robertmaxrees> you just need to modify how you call .datepicker()
[19:07:07] <rizonz> yes I know!
[19:07:12] <robertmaxrees> >.>
[19:07:14] <robertmaxrees> okay?
[19:07:14] <robertmaxrees> lol
[19:07:58] <rizonz> but as that is done with calling it an there is some object above it with all settings I would like to do this: Core.initDatePicker(bla);
[19:08:38] <robertmaxrees> are you passing in the var you want to use to initialize?
[19:08:53] <rizonz> yap!
[19:08:57] <robertmaxrees> then just use it?
[19:18:10] <rizonz> robertmaxrees: it should workd like I did ?
[19:18:20] <robertmaxrees> i have no idea what you're doing!!!
[19:18:21] <robertmaxrees> lol
[19:18:25] <robertmaxrees> you haven't shared your code.
[19:18:53] <rizonz> robertmaxrees: I want to use bla as var id in initDatePicker : function(id) { }
[19:19:31] <robertmaxrees> so long as that's your function and you're not, like, overriding internal jqui stuff.
[19:20:30] <rizonz> robertmaxrees: yes but when I console.log(id) I don't see anything happening
[19:20:42] <robertmaxrees> >.>
[19:20:51] <robertmaxrees> show some code duder.
[19:21:27] <rizonz> oh! I needed the ''
[19:21:46] <robertmaxrees> ?
[19:21:50] <rizonz> x'bla'
[19:21:52] <rizonz> oops
[19:21:54] <rizonz> 'bla'
[19:21:55] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[19:21:59] <robertmaxrees> i'm so confused heh
[19:22:26] <rizonz> the dude who made this just init's the datePicker on EVERY form, even when he doesn't use it
[19:22:41] <robertmaxrees> it happens.
[19:23:35] <rizonz> it kinda sucks when someone does
[19:23:55] <robertmaxrees> well.
[19:24:38] <robertmaxrees> sometimes the reverse order happens - all forms needed it, and then later on somebody added a form that didn't.
[19:24:52] <robertmaxrees> still sloppy, but it happens.
[19:25:01] <rizonz> nah this dev was just lazy and wanted to act fancy on the front end
[19:25:03] <rizonz> *frontend
[19:25:08] <robertmaxrees> 'kay.
[19:25:17] <rizonz> I saw him in court
[19:25:23] <robertmaxrees> wat
[19:25:28] <rizonz> yes indeed
[19:25:38] <robertmaxrees> why did you see him in court?
[19:26:31] <rizonz> he didn't created what we agreeed, took all time to fix his own sh*t and the project was not able to do business, he refused he shares and wanted money... we said, ok sorry mate then that business is not gonna live long anymore and we waved @ him
[19:26:45] <rizonz> *his shares
[19:27:04] <rizonz> it' odd but it happens when people say they can do things they never did before
[19:27:10] <robertmaxrees> lol
[19:27:21] <robertmaxrees> sounds like a poor spec doc.
[19:27:25] <robertmaxrees> and a bad contract.
[19:27:41] <rizonz> robertmaxrees: you know that type of dev that think he is the world, he thinks the world is also big and his own world is very small ?
[19:28:04] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[19:28:52] <rizonz> and when he is devving at some large company in a team and they always say on their CV, I have created this, and that, but are no teamplayers and actuuly forget that they are just a number their but because they are narsistic as hell they just cannot thinkk different... their world stays small
[19:29:13] <rizonz> *actually
[19:29:23] <robertmaxrees> no dev should ever be considered "just a number"
[19:29:31] <robertmaxrees> hell, no person should be considered that.
[19:29:32] <rizonz> some want to be
[19:29:34] <robertmaxrees> but sure.
[19:29:53] <rizonz> as it' easier to follow and never take action on your own that helps, so think out of the box
[19:30:05] <robertmaxrees> you're conflating concepts imo.
[19:30:06] <robertmaxrees> but OK.
[19:30:18] <rizonz> they think out of their own box only which is places in some damn huge box where they don't know the boundries of themself
[19:30:29] <rizonz> *placed
[19:30:40] <robertmaxrees> you're conflating roles.
[19:30:44] <rizonz> let' say daydreamers ;)
[19:30:49] <robertmaxrees> nah.
[19:31:01] <robertmaxrees> you're talking about stables vs volatiles.
[19:31:10] <robertmaxrees> http://randsinrepose.com/archives/stables-and-volatiles/
[19:31:24] <rizonz> I have seen some and they don't have much friends, they have plans they never actually do...
[19:31:29] <rizonz> ok, will read
[19:31:43] <robertmaxrees> and leaders vs team members.
[19:31:55] <rizonz> indeed
[19:31:57] <robertmaxrees> every employee wants to be treated like a person.
[19:32:06] <rizonz> some some team members are not teamplayers
[19:32:14] <robertmaxrees> sure.
[19:32:18] <rizonz> which is an issue
[19:32:25] <robertmaxrees> not really.
[19:32:31] <robertmaxrees> they have a different skillset.
[19:32:38] <robertmaxrees> and usually just need to be coached.
[19:32:46] <rizonz> yes really
[19:32:55] <robertmaxrees> i disagree ;)
[19:33:12] <rizonz> but if they say they are a senior just because they are freelancer... things are bad
[19:33:26] <rizonz> robertmaxrees: :o you said it yourself :P
[19:33:32] <robertmaxrees> said what myself?
[19:33:38] <rizonz> 00:32 < robertmaxrees> and usually just need to be coached.
[19:33:45] <rizonz> I said, yes really!
[19:33:59] * rizonz asks his leeping dog if she agrees
[19:34:00] <robertmaxrees> i thought that was in response to me "

[19:44:09] <rizonz> robertmaxrees: I fixed it, damn you always keep my POV clear :)

[19:46:50] <rizonz> kewl!
[19:47:00] <rizonz> robertmaxrees: I start to love you again
[19:47:03] <rizonz> want to hug as well ?
[19:47:16] <robertmaxrees> uh.
[19:47:19] <robertmaxrees> ...
[19:47:20] <robertmaxrees> heh
[19:47:54] <rizonz> oh man, I have a dog for 2 weeks now, she is lovely and really like to hug!
[19:48:05] <robertmaxrees> Welcome to having a dog.
[19:48:27] <rizonz> yes thanks, I found her in the village where i live
[19:48:31] <rizonz> no chip no nothing
[19:48:34] <rizonz> and she chose me
[19:48:57] <rizonz> first woman who ever did that because they always expect that I chose
[19:49:00] <rizonz> wrong
[19:49:13] <robertmaxrees> heh aaaaanyway.
[19:50:01] <rizonz> iundeed anyways you are not a woman
[19:50:09] <rizonz> or something went wrong today
[19:50:27] <robertmaxrees> just kind of odd to compare women with a dog ;)
[19:50:32] <robertmaxrees> moving on.
[19:58:44] <rizonz> err, you made that comparison, tho female dogs are nice(r) to me
[19:58:58] <rizonz> ok moving on
[20:02:04] <robertmaxrees> lol
[20:18:11] <rizonz> robert_: but trust me, I' a lucky bastard with her!
[20:18:26] <rizonz> I got her 3 days and she needed to travel with me 1000KM, no problem!
[20:18:35] <rizonz> and 1000KM back
[20:19:22] <rizonz> and the seoond drive took us 24H, we slept in the car (Citroen C1) she @ the back seat with plenty of room, me in the front :P
[20:25:51] <rizonz> mh is it me or are the locales not named that well ?
[20:44:15] <vitx> Hello, if I have <span><span>Word</span></span> how do I remove duplicates ?
[20:50:30] <vitx> Anyone ?
[21:15:09] <vitx> hello ?
[21:17:20] <SirLagz> vitx: duplicates of what? <span> ?
[21:17:26] <vitx> yes
[21:17:36] <vitx> I want to have one span instead of two or three
[21:17:45] <SirLagz> vitx: why do you have two or three in the first place?
[21:18:03] <vitx> it's just weird page formatting that I will have to take care of
[21:19:09] <SirLagz> vitx: I guess you could loop through all spans, see if they have spans under it, then strip them out of the HTML...
[21:19:21] <vitx> there is no one liner to do that ?
[21:19:59] <SirLagz> vitx: I've never come across that particular issue so don't have anything handy
[21:25:26] <robert_> okay, so this is interesting.
[21:29:57] <SirLagz> vitx: something like this should work - https://jsfiddle.net/jj8wa1y7/
[21:30:18] <SirLagz> vitx: might not be the best solution, but only thing I can think of atm
[21:32:49] <vitx> SirLagz: Thanks a lot
[21:34:13] <SirLagz> vitx: no problems
[21:50:52] <rizonz> I hope it' not dirty to set a global variabe and use it later on in your JS but I need it
[21:51:07] <rizonz> at least this works :)
[22:08:14] <bobdobbs> If I use js to create a function that waits for an element to clicked and then does something to respond, have I
[22:08:28] <bobdobbs> ... have I "attached an event listener to an element"?
