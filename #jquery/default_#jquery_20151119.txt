[00:39:26] <bfig> hello, I've been having some issues with droppable. The hitbox for the droppable is not being computed correctly
[00:52:03] <bfig> \I tried changing the toleranceType to 'pointer' but it doesn't really work that well
[00:58:16] * robhol slaps SirLagz around a bit with a large trout
[02:24:09] <mac_miniature> Is anybody here
[03:13:14] <Mark_2> how do i make this one a toggle one? onclick=“jQuery(‘.class’).css(‘something’,’none’)”
[03:13:36] <Cork> you don't
[03:13:42] <Cork> you can't toggle a css value
[03:13:59] <Mark_2> um..
[03:14:04] <Cork> Mark_2: define the different states in the stylesheet and toggle a class
[03:14:34] <Mark_2> i just came back from really long break from learning jquery
[03:14:39] <Mark_2> can you be specific how i can do it?
[03:14:54] <Mark_2> i think i got what you are saying though.
[03:14:58] <Cork> .toggleClass('something-state')
[03:15:09] <Cork> .something-state { something: none }
[03:15:24] <Cork> the later goes into the css file
[03:16:29] <Mark_2> hmm...
[03:16:45] <Mark_2> so onclick=“jQuery.toggleClass(‘something’)” would this work?
[03:16:51] <Cork> ya
[03:17:00] <Cork> though don't use event attributes
[03:17:06] <Mark_2> i’d give it try.
[03:17:13] <Cork> though don't use event attributes <--
[03:17:13] <Mark_2> there’s no other option for me
[03:17:20] <Cork> uh.. why not?
[03:17:37] <Cork> event attributes are horrible, and cause all kind of problems
[03:18:05] <Mark_2> but how does toggle know which attribute it has to toggle??
[03:18:12] <Mark_2> if i dont specify what it is
[03:18:18] <Cork> it toggles a class
[03:18:22] <Mark_2> hmm.
[03:18:24] <Cork> not a css property
[03:19:34] <Mark_2> i want it to display:none and display:block
[03:19:39] <Mark_2> and it doesn’t work.
[03:20:07] <Mark_2> and it’s a check box.
[03:30:31] <aolko> hi guys
[03:31:46] <aolko> bit unrelated, but how do i tell mixitup (which is a jquery plugin with bad support) to animate all the divs, but not only "transitioning to" div? http://i.imgur.com/JAtVTdW.gifv
[03:47:22] <Mark_2> ha.
[03:47:26] <Mark_2> solve it.
[03:47:29] <aolko> anyone?
[03:47:32] <Mark_2> *solved.
[04:27:38] <tuskkk___> I have four items with the class "hfi-icon-minus", not I want an onlick event on three of them. How to exclude the 4th one?
[04:28:19] <Cork> tuskkk___: your probably adding the event handlers directly to the elemnt
[04:28:30] <Cork> and the forth is added after you added the handlers so it didn't get one
[04:28:38] <Cork> the solution is to delegate the event handler to a static parent
[04:29:49] <tuskkk___> Cork: I am doing a .click, -> $(".hfi-icon-add, .hfi-icon-minus").click(function() {
[04:29:59] <Cork> ya, so delegate it
[04:30:04] <tuskkk___> how?
[04:30:20] <Cork> read http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[04:37:51] <tuskkk___> Cork: but even after using .on, the even attaches to that 4th element, I want to select only 3!
[04:38:19] <Cork> tuskkk___: make sure to read the delegate page, and use the delegate syntax for on
[04:38:22] <Cork> not the bind one
[04:38:38] <Cork> that is why i pointed you to delegate and not on
[04:38:53] <tuskkk___> ok
[04:41:52] <tuskkk___> Cork: used this, $("#manage_organizaiton right").on('click','.hfi-icon-add, .hfi-icon-minus', function() { , with no effect :(
[04:42:29] <Cork> tuskkk___:  --> right"<--
[04:42:43] <Cork> you either have a space by mistake or a missing dot
[04:42:49] <tuskkk___> oh
[04:43:38] <Cork> and i would prob have bound that to #manage_organizaiton directly
[04:43:41] <tuskkk___> awesome, it works as intended, thanks a lot Cork!
[04:43:46] <Cork> np
[04:44:08] <tuskkk___> but then the 4th items is also inside #manage_organization
[04:44:18] <Cork> ah
[04:44:20] <tuskkk___> it has class left instead of right
[04:44:39] <Cork> then i misunderstood your original question
[04:44:47] <Cork> well, delegation is the correct choice anyway :)
[04:45:00] <tuskkk___> oh ok, thanks :)
[04:45:17] <Cork> tuskkk___: i read it as the handler DIDN'T work for the forth element
[04:45:31] <Cork> not that you didn't want it to trigger for it
[04:45:35] <tuskkk___> oh
[04:45:47] <zagaza-> hi guys, just being curious. Say you have an image.. and you hover it.. what would it take to be able to detect the color at a certain place? say half the image is black and half is white.. and when you hover the black area of it, you'd want the cursor to turn white, and vice versa. How could that be done? Would you have to put the image in a canvas or something?
[04:45:48] <tuskkk___> so what would have been the solution then? :)
[04:46:06] <Cork> tuskkk___: just limiting the selector to only match the elements you want to match
[04:46:22] <Cork> tuskkk___: but as you want it for a few elements anyway delegation is a good choice anyway
[04:46:43] <tuskkk___> ok, I guess its good now.
[04:46:46] <Cork> ya
[04:50:14] <morfar> On chrome; if you mouse down red box but mouse up on green box, the click event on the green box is triggering. How can I prevent that? https://jsfiddle.net/1r1e4hfg/1/
[04:50:24] <morfar> Firefox is fine.
[04:51:21] <Cork> morfar: don't use stopPropagation
[04:52:21] <morfar> What should I use?
[04:52:24] <Cork> https://jsfiddle.net/1r1e4hfg/2/
[04:52:47] <Cork> that still doesn't fix the bug though
[04:53:16] <Cork> not sure what is the correct effect there actually
[04:54:28] <morfar> Yeah, I'd like to know too.
[04:54:40] <Cork> i'm trying something, give me a min
[04:55:47] <morfar> Thanks :)
[04:55:56] <Cork> hmm not even capture works...
[04:56:58] <Cork> wow...
[04:57:09] <Cork> it actually looks like it isn't defined by the spec...
[04:58:11] <Cork> morfar: either way you might want to use mousedown and mouseup instead
[04:58:22] <Cork> and store what element the mousedown was on
[04:58:42] <Cork> cause if this get changed it will be a while anyway
[04:58:43] <morfar> Yeah ok, that was my backup plan.
[04:59:30] <morfar> ty
[05:00:08] <Cork> morfar: i'm going to hijack that jsfiddle if it is ok :)
[05:00:19] <Cork> i'm going to ask around a bit to see what is going on here
[05:01:35] <domino> Hello
[05:02:43] <domino> just a question , i have 2 php page, Index.php and find.php
[05:03:18] <domino> when i load Index.php all regular the browser shows the page
[05:03:45] <domino> in index.php i have a button that load find.php
[05:05:08] <domino> find.php is loaded from jquery and inside find.php there is <script type="text/javascript" src="/js/findOX2.js"></script>
[05:05:37] <domino> when the browser start loading the included page i get:
[05:05:57] <domino> Synchronous XMLHttpRequest on the main thread is deprecated because of its detrimental effects to the end user's experience. For more help, check
[05:18:30] <Rokko_11> Hi! I would like to do something as long as a key is pressed
[05:19:18] <Rokko_11> if I use keydown() or keypress(), the event get's fired many times, not only once for each key press
[05:19:26] <Rokko_11> do you know if there is a jQuery function for this?
[05:20:04] <domino> did you use preventDefault();?
[05:20:56] <Birliban> Hi, I want to display/hide a div depending on a checkbox. I know it can be triggered with click this is one thing i need, but I also want to trigger it when the page is loaded and the checkbox is already checked (serverside, from database-data eg.)
[05:21:04] <domino> basically you catch your event -> bloc all default action -> do watever you want
[05:32:40] <AdamPDotty> Birliban: something like if (checkbox.val()) checkbox.trigger('click'); on load.
[05:33:27] <Birliban> AdamPDotty: ok, this could work... i'll try
[05:34:31] <Birliban> but then i have two actions to trigger, one on load and one on click
[05:34:35] <domino> AdamPDotty, can you help with Synchronous XMLHttpRequest on the main thread is deprecated because of its detrimental effects to the end user's experience. For more help, check
[05:41:15] <Cork> morfar: man that took a while
[05:41:21] <Cork> it is a chrome bug
[05:41:37] <morfar> oh ok
[05:41:41] <Cork> the click event shouldn't fire if you move the mouse out of the target element
[05:41:43] <morfar> I think IE is the same
[05:41:50] <morfar> okok
[05:42:05] <Cork> i didn't realize at first that that was what happened
[05:42:21] <Cork> (could have sworn i got firefox to fire on the original element...)
[05:42:42] <Cork> the spec is quite clear on the matter
[05:45:07] <morfar> Ok, good to know. I'll do the work around for now anyways :P
[05:54:23] <Stummi> hi there. Can I select all elements with their text matching a given pattern?
[05:56:42] <Cork> Stummi: kinda, but you should avoid it
[05:57:08] <Cork> $('*').filter(function() { return $(this).text() == "match test"; });
[05:59:07] <Stummi> Cork, well, can't avoid it here, since I am writing a greasemonkey script for a website and what I want to select does not have a distinct id or class. Thanks
[05:59:44] <Cork> Stummi: well start by using a selector as far as possible
[05:59:56] <Cork> cause text selection is really slow
[06:00:06] <droid909> Stummi: find() use it
[06:00:13] <Cork> uh...
[06:00:20] <Cork> droid909: did you even read the question?
[06:00:25] <droid909> Cork: no :(
[06:01:00] <Cork> Stummi: so my recommendation would be to do something like $('#parent a').filter(function() { return $(this).text() });
[06:01:15] <Cork> that way you don't loop every element in the page
[06:01:24] <domino> how i can avoid Synchronous XMLHttpRequest on the main thread is deprecated, when i include more javascript after a jquery post call?
[06:02:03] <Cork> domino: use async ajax calls and use the callbacks for when the code is fetched
[06:02:55] <domino> How i can do an async post call?
[06:03:04] <Cork> you can do anything async
[06:03:09] <Cork> well all the verbs
[07:12:29] <wili> hello guys, anyone can help me with choosing plugin for input for writing tags/keywords? currently I am using tag it, but I need to achieve something like this https://www.dropbox.com/s/pjlbpbwk3jxkhd8/Screenshot%202015-11-19%2013.11.37.png?dl=0 that means that I want some input field for write one keyword and then will be added to some other element, but on the other side my site works on django so it require gather content from input 
[07:13:00] <wili> my actual solution looks like this https://www.dropbox.com/s/ktyhir40pfvrt90/Screenshot%202015-11-19%2013.12.50.png?dl=0
[07:13:19] <wili> if it will be hard, I can change my design/concept
[07:14:31] <hellyeah> hey
[07:15:00] <hellyeah> i want to create spesific amount of counterDivision what did i do wrong here? https://jsfiddle.net/0wy6zgsu/43/
[07:32:43] <Amnesia> question, does anyone over here know a library that facilitates "history functionality" for webapps that store their state in the DOM ?
[07:33:09] <Amnesia> currently I'm using a setPage() function, which fills a div with some html
[07:34:12] <Duikb00t> https://paste.ee/p/Oky5D  This works pertty well.
[07:34:44] <Duikb00t> But only 1 way I click ithe image shows up. But what if other .c-tabs-nav  got clicked? or any other link.  Then I don't want that image
[07:36:31] <taplar> Duikb00t: you saying you want that image to go away if something else is clicked?
[07:36:38] <Duikb00t> Exactly.
[07:37:13] <taplar> you would most likely have to put a bind on body to do that check and removal
[07:38:13] <hellyeah> i just want to add spesific amount of counter division to body. But there is no result here. Why is that? https://jsfiddle.net/0wy6zgsu/50/
[07:39:27] <hellyeah> first at counterDvision to division i create in js then add division to the body
[07:40:16] <taplar> what is the issue?
[07:41:45] <SirLagz> robhol: ow
[07:41:55] <hellyeah> issue?
[07:41:57] <robhol> :>
[07:42:13] <hellyeah> i expect to see 15 more buttons there
[07:42:19] <hellyeah> but there is no buttons there
[07:42:33] <hellyeah> damn
[07:43:02] <hellyeah> fixed my little typo https://jsfiddle.net/0wy6zgsu/51/
[07:43:17] <Duikb00t> Hmmm taplar  how would I do that.
[07:43:24] <hellyeah> i just try to create 15 more buttons because my arraywithoutdupe has 5 index
[07:43:50] <Duikb00t> $('body).on(.....
[07:43:52] <Duikb00t> like that?
[07:44:19] <taplar> Duikb00t: yeah, or if you wanting to only remove it if they click one of the other links you could bind to the other links.  but either way, ya
[07:44:36] <Duikb00t> I want to disable the background image that's all.
[07:44:58] <Duikb00t> When a user clicks an other element except the one where the image is being set.
[07:45:33] <Duikb00t> Ok I get what I have to change but where to add that on click event?  I can't do it inside the  current one I guess
[07:47:31] <taplar> hellyeah: uh, this is really confusing
[07:47:54] <taplar> your loop is selecting existing elements, appending them to a new div and doing that over and over
[07:48:05] <taplar> which after the first loop the div is reused
[07:48:11] <hellyeah> fixed typos here https://jsfiddle.net/0wy6zgsu/52/
[07:48:31] <taplar> still the same issue
[07:48:35] <taplar> your not creating new elements
[07:48:56] <hellyeah> not?
[07:48:59] <hellyeah> hmm
[07:49:05] <Duikb00t> Ok taplar  : https://paste.ee/p/kfb8N
[07:49:14] <taplar> hellyeah: why do you think you are?
[07:49:15] <Duikb00t> But that body click isn't doing it
[07:49:38] <hellyeah> i suppose that create element var $division = $('<div>'); taplar
[07:49:52] <taplar> Duikb00t: lets see
[07:49:53] <Duikb00t> When I remove the body click listener I made it works.  But then it isn't being removed. When I keep it like the code is now nothing happends, no error
[07:50:23] <taplar> Duikb00t: you need to stopPropagation and maybe preventDefault to the event in your first click for that to work
[07:50:29] <Duikb00t> oh ok
[07:50:35] <taplar> it's adding it, but then the event is bubbling up to the body and removing it
[07:50:43] <taplar> so you have to stop the bubble in that case
[07:50:54] <Duikb00t> I was thinking about that but wasn't sure that was needed.
[07:51:01] <taplar> hellyeah: that's just happening once, and that's just the div
[07:51:15] <Duikb00t> https://paste.ee/p/MmS0I
[07:51:17] <taplar> your selecting existing elements and appending them else where.  that does not create new elements, just moves them
[07:51:29] <Duikb00t> Stil nothing :D
[07:51:47] <taplar> do e.stopPropagation() also
[07:52:09] <Duikb00t> Ok that solved it
[07:52:13] <taplar> :)
[07:52:21] <Duikb00t> I am always confused about those 2
[07:52:29] <taplar> the stopPropagation stops the bubble
[07:52:50] <Duikb00t> I know return false blocks it all but stopPropagation and preventDefault
[07:52:50] <taplar> preventDefault stops other events on the same element i believe
[07:52:58] <taplar> so if you had multiple click event handlers for instance
[07:53:14] <Duikb00t> multiple click handlers in the same html element?
[07:53:18] <Duikb00t> element/structure
[07:53:19] <Duikb00t> ?
[07:53:20] <taplar> you can
[07:53:40] <taplar> it gets weird, but js allows it
[07:54:30] <hellyeah> div is root
[07:54:36] <taplar> or think about an input in a form
[07:54:37] <hellyeah> i try to append childs
[07:54:42] <taplar> hitting enter is a keypress and a form submit
[07:54:42] <Duikb00t> sweet
[07:54:50] <Duikb00t> ok ok
[07:54:54] <taplar> so preventing default in the key press stops the form submit too
[07:55:13] <Duikb00t> So you can have 2 'events' firing on the same  element
[07:55:15] <taplar> hellyeah: it doesn't matter
[07:55:25] <taplar> existing elements are moved, not duplicated when appended else where
[07:55:32] <hellyeah> ic
[07:55:39] <taplar> Duikb00t: yep, one after another
[07:55:45] <hellyeah> DAMN
[07:57:10] <hellyeah> taplar: what about this https://jsfiddle.net/0wy6zgsu/54/ ?
[07:57:32] <taplar> does it work?
[07:57:47] <hellyeah> no
[07:57:52] <taplar> :) so why you asking me?
[07:57:57] <hellyeah> :xd
[07:58:07] <taplar> fiddle man.  fiddle!
[07:58:17] <hellyeah> and i dont understand why div is under counterDivisiion
[07:58:31] <hellyeah> it is not related with counterDivision
[07:58:43] <taplar> huh?
[07:58:48] <Duikb00t> http://jsfiddle.net/4hw5rh3y/
[07:58:50] <hellyeah> ops
[07:58:52] <Duikb00t> trying to get this :D
[07:58:53] <hellyeah> sorry
[07:59:16] <hellyeah> it creates div but there is no button
[07:59:31] <hellyeah> xD
[07:59:47] <taplar> what is your for each doing?
[08:01:29] <hellyeah> forEach iterates arrwithoutdupe
[08:01:53] <taplar> btw that's an invalid use of clone
[08:02:17] <hellyeah> i changed it to append
[08:02:28] <hellyeah> so i am creating div again and again
[08:02:42] <hellyeah> i each step of foreach it creates div
[08:02:43] <hellyeah> https://jsfiddle.net/0wy6zgsu/57/
[08:03:13] <taplar> ok, and ?
[08:03:25] <hellyeah> div was created
[08:03:30] <hellyeah> button is not there
[08:03:58] <taplar> what do you mean it's not there?
[08:04:33] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/0wy6zgsu/59/
[08:05:30] <hellyeah> hmm
[08:05:42] <hellyeah> well i cannot see buttons in element tab
[08:05:49] <hellyeah> it is just <div></div>
[08:06:03] <hellyeah> i have 5  <div></div>
[08:06:15] <taplar> you still have your original issue
[08:06:23] <taplar> your not creating new buttons
[08:06:44] <hellyeah> but buttons are in counter division
[08:06:54] <taplar> so?
[08:06:54] <hellyeah> cant i use those buttons?
[08:07:00] <taplar> sure
[08:07:13] <taplar> but, again, your appending existing elements
[08:07:32] <hellyeah> so i cannot appending existing element then
[08:07:50] <taplar> you can, but it does not achieve the desired result you want, being creating new elements
[08:08:23] <hellyeah> i need to have three buttons
[08:08:23] <taplar> so what's the problem?
[08:08:28] <hellyeah> hmm
[08:09:15] <hellyeah> hmm
[08:09:19] <hellyeah> now i see
[08:09:27] <hellyeah> actually it added to the first div
[08:09:35] <taplar> has nothing to do with the div
[08:09:36] <hellyeah> didnt add the other
[08:09:45] <taplar> hellyeah:
[08:09:50] <taplar> your wanting new elements
[08:09:57] <taplar> appending existing elements does not do that
[08:09:59] <taplar> so....
[08:10:09] <hellyeah> create element
[08:10:14] <taplar> how do you do that?
[08:10:18] <taplar> what are your options?
[08:10:34] <hellyeah> var $buttons = $('<button>');
[08:10:37] <taplar> or?
[08:10:55] <hellyeah> document.createElement
[08:10:58] <taplar> or?
[08:11:13] <taplar> both of those assume you start from scratch
[08:11:21] <hellyeah> humm
[08:11:27] <taplar> you had the function earlier
[08:11:36] <hellyeah> are you talking about creating element from existing element
[08:11:40] <taplar> yes
[08:12:12] <hellyeah> well
[08:12:35] <hellyeah> var buttons = ('.counterDivision .buttonClass'); ?
[08:12:50] <taplar> no, you were using the right function earlier, just on the wrong element
[08:13:31] <taplar> i got an element.  i want to duplicate the element so i _____ it
[08:13:38] <hellyeah> append?
[08:13:49] <taplar> -_-
[08:13:56] <hellyeah> damn
[08:13:57] <hellyeah> clone
[08:14:03] <taplar> i've said atleast two times that that doesn't work
[08:14:10] <hellyeah> ops
[08:14:16] <taplar> clone man
[08:14:17] <taplar> clone
[08:14:39] <taplar> appending existing elements doesn't duplicate
[08:14:43] <taplar> but appending the clone of one does
[08:14:44] <hellyeah> damn
[08:14:49] <taplar> as clone is an entirely new element
[08:15:16] <taplar> before you were cloning the div, not the buttons
[08:16:32] <hellyeah> taplar: you mean thiss https://jsfiddle.net/0wy6zgsu/61/
[08:16:54] <taplar> http://api.jquery.com/clone/
[08:17:36] <hellyeah> sorry my head almost bllow up
[08:17:44] <hellyeah> sometimes i feel like a stup xD
[08:18:29] <hellyeah> damn it
[08:18:42] <hellyeah> https://jsfiddle.net/0wy6zgsu/63/
[08:19:02] <taplar> pretty, :)
[08:19:27] <hellyeah> i guess i need to know when i take fresh hair
[08:19:37] <hellyeah> so
[08:19:40] <hellyeah> as short note
[08:19:48] <hellyeah> you can append existing element
[08:19:52] <taplar> if you ever have doubts about a jquery method, always look it up in the api
[08:19:53] <hellyeah> but you can clone it
[08:20:04] <hellyeah> is that right idea?
[08:20:17] <hellyeah> brb
[08:20:44] <taplar> append does not duplicate.  it only attaches the elements to the dom.  if the element already is attached, it will detach first before attaching.
[08:21:04] <taplar> that's it's responsibility
[08:21:08] <taplar> nothing more
[08:50:37] <creigfur> Hello. I want to alert text which has <div>, <br>, <table> and other tags but to keep the representation (table to show as table, <br> to break line, etc.). How can I do this?
[08:51:09] <taplar> you'll have to use a dialog
[08:51:16] <taplar> or some form of that
[08:51:43] <taplar> by alert you do mean like an in page popup?
[08:52:38] <lc23> what is the best way to use jqurey to send data from a built sharepoint application to a sharepoint list on submit ?
[08:54:38] <creigfur> taplar: modal dialog is what I mean
[08:55:08] <taplar> http://jqueryui.com/dialog/
[08:57:00] <Kartagis> in http://monentjs.com, Format dates first line is constantly updated. is that ajax?
[08:57:37] <Kartagis> momentjs.com
[08:59:45] <taplar> Kartagis: you can check your network tab to see if calls are being fired
[09:00:21] <Kartagis> nothing
[09:01:34] <taplar> so no, :)
[09:05:50] <Kartagis> taplar: any idea what it is?
[09:06:10] <taplar> if it's not ajax then most likely either a setInterval or setTimeout
[09:13:01] <Guest56037> how can i check if an element is lets say a <form> ?
[09:13:10] <Guest56037> s/element/object
[09:13:10] <b-ot> Correction, <Guest56037> how can i check if an object is lets say a <form> ?
[09:13:21] <Guest56037> fancy bot :)
[09:15:27] <Cork> Guest56037: and by object you mean what?
[09:15:40] <Cork> you mean if a known dom element is a form?
[09:15:55] <Guest56037> $jQobject.is('form');
[09:15:57] <Cork> or a jquery object contains a form?
[09:16:01] <Guest56037> i guess thats what im looking for, right?
[09:16:09] <Cork> if the later yes
[09:16:28] <Guest56037> thank you
[09:19:17] <lc23> can some one tell me if my code it correct for sending data to a sharepoint 365 list  http://pastebin.com/fpHx2iTV
[09:26:02] <mdev> $(document.body).on('mouseenter', '.table_with_entries tbody tr', function(event) {
[09:26:08] <mdev> can't get that to work, or mouseover
[09:26:16] <mdev> click works, but I need a mouse over detection
[09:26:26] <mdev> that table entries are added after the fact
[09:26:39] <mdev> so stuff outside of .on doesn't work either
[09:27:27] <Cork> mdev: jsfiddle a demo of the problem
[09:39:13] <mdev> I'm sorry HAL I can not do that
[09:44:56] <Kartagis> taplar: it was setTimeout
[09:45:22] <lc23> Can someone look at my code and let me know if they see anything wrong with it http://pastebin.com/fpHx2iTV
[09:48:59] <mdev> I worked it out
[09:51:34] <taplar> lc23: if you haven't already you should check out the documentation https://spservices.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=$%28%29.SPServices&referringTitle=Documentation
[09:52:21] <taplar> i am completely unfamiliar with this plugin, but just glancing at the docs and your snipplet, one thing i notice your using 'url' and the docs have 'webURL'
[09:52:30] <lc23> thanks Taplar
[09:53:05] <taplar> also i didn't scrounge around much but that site might have some help forums or maybe even an irc of their own that might be able to give you more targeted support
[09:54:53] <bfig> I've been having some issues with droppable. The hitbox for the droppable is not being computed correctly. I tried changing the toleranceType to 'pointer' but it doesn't really work that well
[10:18:40] <fifthshift_> hey all. I have a JSON array of objects (http://pastebin.com/xNMzipPM) which I'm trying to parse though and manipulate the DOM with. I am trying to match the field CONumber to the element id of a repeating field, and then I want to insert some stuff when the element id and the object field match. I can't figure quite figure out how to access the key/value pair inside each object and efficiently match element ids to object information
[10:19:15] <fifthshift_> I tried nested $.each's, but that didn't do it for me
[10:19:22] <hellyeah> taplar: can i get your idea about something?
[10:19:39] <taplar> JSON.parse(jsonString).forEach(function(element){/*do stuff*/});
[10:19:43] <hellyeah> fifthshift_: did you fiddle it_
[10:19:59] <fifthshift_> hellyeah I did not fiddle it but probably should
[10:20:08] <fifthshift_> taplar is it really that simple?
[10:20:14] <taplar> hellyeah: make it quick.  i got a meeting soon
[10:20:18] <fifthshift_> let me try that real quick
[10:20:18] <taplar> fifthshift_: pretty much
[10:20:21] <hellyeah> okey sure
[10:20:43] <hellyeah> fifthshift_: each is for jquery object forEach is for jsObject
[10:21:13] <fifthshift_> ah okay
[10:21:26] <taplar> jsObject = array
[10:21:27] <taplar> ;)
[10:21:48] <fifthshift_> for what it's worth, the typeof for the object in question is just printed as 'object'
[10:21:56] <fifthshift_> which is what sort of lead me to trying .each
[10:22:16] <taplar> json parses into either an object or an array
[10:22:33] <taplar> wrapping elements in $() makes it a jQuery object
[10:22:33] <fifthshift_> it is actually the return from an $.parseJSON(ajax_data)
[10:23:04] <taplar> works the same way
[10:23:13] <taplar> parseJSON is just a wrapper for older browsers
[10:24:03] <fifthshift_> does that mean in respObj = $.parseJSON(data); JSON.parse(respObj).forEach(/*stuff*/), the .parseJSON is kinda  redundant?
[10:24:10] <fifthshift_> 'cause that's what it sounds like
[10:24:11] <hellyeah> this is the effort i have so far https://jsfiddle.net/0wy6zgsu/69/ each button you see there is a counter. My table can have red, orange, gray records If you check above you see Info in jSon string. out of date mans gray, there is a failure  means red, performance problem means orange.

[10:24:55] <hellyeah> understandable
[10:25:34] <hellyeah> hope understandable
[10:25:45] <hellyeah> not sure my english is great :D
[10:25:54] <hellyeah> fifthshift_:
[10:25:55] <taplar_> that'll take me a bit to read and i gotta step out for a bit.
[10:26:13] <hellyeah> if you check jquery object with type of you may see something different
[10:26:25] <hellyeah> wrap your object with $
[10:26:39] <hellyeah> let say var x; x is js thing here
[10:26:52] <hellyeah> but if you wrap with $(x) it is jquery object
[10:26:58] <hellyeah> so you chose two ways
[10:27:04] <hellyeah> let me write real quick
[10:27:13] <hellyeah> $(x).each(function(....
[10:27:14] <hellyeah> or
[10:27:26] <hellyeah> x.forEach(function(...
[10:27:48] <hellyeah> personally i choose forEach in this case
[10:28:11] <fifthshift_> gotcha
[10:28:13] <hellyeah> but let say you have a lot of buttons with same class
[10:28:27] <fifthshift_> you would use $(.buttonclass).each
[10:28:31] <hellyeah> you can do like $('.buttonClass').each
[10:28:41] <hellyeah> dont forget single quote
[10:28:45] <fifthshift_> makes sense hellyeah
[10:28:47] <hellyeah> or
[10:29:04] <hellyeah> var buttons = document.querySelectorAll('.buttonClass')
[10:29:12] <hellyeah> buttons.forEach(..)
[10:29:22] <hellyeah> jquery way is simpler so go for it
[10:29:36] <hellyeah> and when you consider about cross browser issue
[10:29:40] <hellyeah> stick with jquery
[10:30:06] <hellyeah> taplar_meeting: thank we can talk tomorrow
[10:30:12] <hellyeah> fifthshift_: hope it is clear
[11:04:03] <iamgiri> can anyone tell me how to use this variable in this callback?  https://github.com/antennaio/jquery-bar-rating/blob/master/jquery.barrating.js#L486
[11:04:29] <iamgiri> i mean “this” keyword
[11:29:41] <alex88> hi there, how's possible that chrome when I hover with the devtools on the body shows 951px of height and jquery's $(document).height() shows 1141? I've also tried $('body') and innerHeight, outerHeight, same result
[11:40:48] <johndoe2> alex88 $(window).height() is the viewport size that chrome reports
[11:41:11] <johndoe2> alex88 you also need a strict html doctype to make that behave on mobile browsers (as I've found out the hard way)
[11:41:50] <alex88> johndoe2: chrome reports window height when you select the body element's height?
[11:43:01] <johndoe2> alex88 oh I just realized the second number wasn't that large. I was thinking viewport/document sizes
[11:43:22] <alex88> Since I'm resizing an iframe on window resize
[11:43:29] <alex88> internally I send a postmessage to the parent
[11:44:06] <johndoe2> what are you passing to the parent?
[11:44:10] <alex88> but basically iframe sends 951 as initial content size, then parent resizes the iframe to 951, iframe handles the resize and tells the parent to resize to 1141 and go on
[11:44:20] <alex88> it always add 190 to the height
[11:44:26] <alex88> the $(document).height()
[11:44:39] <alex88> and the parent page resizes the iframe to that height
[11:45:02] <johndoe2> does it display the contents of the iframe entirely when it sets it to 951?
[11:45:47] <alex88> yes, in fact no scrollbars and chrome says the iframe's html and body height is 951 without any margins or padding
[11:45:54] <alex88> https://gist.github.com/alex88/977c326c481b5e7a8170 this is the coffeescript code
[11:49:05] <johndoe2> that's odd, for this type of stuff I'd console.log() the crap out of those variables being passed between to find out which one adds 190 to the height
[11:49:34] <johndoe2> my uneducated guess would be that the parent function somehow adds those pixels
[11:50:03] <alex88> I've done that, same thing, let me add the parent window function
[11:50:28] <alex88> https://gist.github.com/alex88/977c326c481b5e7a8170
[11:50:56] <alex88> right after the resize, if I put the console in the iframe and run $(document).height() it's the height set by the parent + 190
[11:51:06] <alex88> maybe it's a combination of margins and other crap
[11:51:27] <johndoe2> I don't know why you would have margins on an iframe though
[11:52:10] <johndoe2> alex88 you're using $(window).height() on the parent, right? Because that would not equal the height of your iframe
[11:52:36] <alex88> johndoe2: wut? You mean in the iframe?
[11:52:50] <johndoe2> if you did $("#myiframe").height() you should end up with 951 when requesting it from the parent
[11:53:12] <alex88> requesting from the parent?
[11:53:14] <alex88> what you mean?
[11:53:33] <johndoe2> the parent houses the iframe, right?
[11:53:36] <alex88> yup
[11:54:16] <alex88> oh anyway
[11:54:18] <johndoe2> so if you ask for $(document).height() from the parent side of things it will give you the height of your parent document, including the height of that iframe it contains. So if you have buttons and such, they'll increase the height
[11:54:40] <johndoe2> a menu, a footer
[11:54:40] <alex88> I've just seen that body is 951, the first children of body is 1141
[11:55:02] <alex88> $(document).height() is run inside the frame
[11:55:04] <alex88> not in the parent
[11:55:34] <johndoe2> and you're inspecting the body tag inside the iframe with chrome?
[11:56:01] <robertmaxrees> sounds like maybe a document ready vs window load issue.
[11:56:05] <robertmaxrees> but i got to the party late sooo
[11:56:18] <taplar> not a fun party anyway
[11:56:24] <johndoe2> yeah I'm not entirely sure: <alex88>	hi there, how's possible that chrome when I hover with the devtools on the body shows 951px of height and jquery's $(document).height() shows 1141? I've also tried $('body') and innerHeight, outerHeight, same result
[11:56:44] <johndoe2> I don't know if he's inspecting the body inside the iframe or the parent's body tag in chrome
[11:56:53] <alex88> robertmaxrees: nope, window is completely loaded, this is done on window resize much later than window load
[11:57:03] <alex88> I was inspecting the body inside the iframe
[11:57:28] <robertmaxrees> there could be all kinds of reasons.  margins, funky css, browser weirdness.
[11:57:42] <alex88> anyway, I've just seen that the first child of the body has height (body+190) so the 190 more height is from there
[11:57:57] <robertmaxrees> positioning can impact it, too.
[11:58:11] <johndoe2> cool you got a lead
[12:00:11] <alex88> yeah, I'll try to find something from that one
[12:00:12] <alex88> thanks!
[12:19:30] <taplar> zzZZzzZZ
[12:23:32] <jani_> hello. i have a question.
[12:23:34] <jani_> http://www.urdupoint.com/showbiz/news-detail/fashion-news/live-news-537182.html
[12:24:00] <jani_> I want the same feature as in this link. i.e. right click disabled and also no one can view the page source
[12:24:11] <jani_> how is it possible?
[12:25:48] <decx> it's not feasible
[12:26:03] <jani_> mean?
[12:26:35] <jani_> then how the current link is having this feature?
[12:26:43] <decx> it's a cheap trick to hijack mouseinputs because you can still view the source
[12:27:10] <jani_> do you see the source ?
[12:27:21] <taplar> yep
[12:27:23] <decx> of course
[12:27:35] <taplar> dev tools, inspector.  hello source
[12:28:03] <decx> disabling right click just makes people that much more interested in checking the source btw
[12:28:05] <jani_> I can't even right click on it nor Cntr+U is working to view source
[12:28:37] <taplar> FF Ctrl+Shift+c
[12:28:55] <taplar> or the menu to get it
[12:29:33] <decx> yeah you can hijack any input
[12:29:46] <taplar> the question is why do you want to hide the source?  for a security reason?  if so that's a terrible idea
[12:31:38] <decx> they use a jquery plugin called "smartcontentprotector"
[12:31:47] <decx> Protect your Text and Images by Disabling the Mouse Right Click and Possible Shortcut Keys for Cut (CTRL+x), Copy (CTRL+c), Paste (CTRL+v), Select All(CTRL+a), View Source (CTRL+u) etc.
[12:32:02] <taplar> lol
[12:32:03] <decx> just what i thought they just hijack all the events
[12:32:18] <taplar> protect your images
[12:32:21] <taplar> lmao
[12:32:28] <decx> meanwhile i've got javascript disabled ^^
[12:32:46] <taplar> not even that
[12:32:51] <taplar> menu, page info
[12:32:57] <taplar> download whatever file is loaded
[12:33:00] <decx> yeah no event for that
[12:33:25] <jani_> yeah. I want to protect the text and other contents of my site. user just view it and can't copy something
[12:33:27] <decx> regardless, any webdev will have a good chuckle if they see your site has this
[12:34:07] <decx> copyright is automatic
[12:34:35] <jani_> then what is the best solution for this?
[12:34:39] <decx> and if people hotlink your images you can send them dick pictures
[12:36:29] <decx> well what do all the stockphoto sites do
[12:36:34] <decx> watermarks
[12:37:10] <decx> there's probably some way to send encrypted data into canvas but that's just wasted time
[12:37:24] <taplar> and in that case often low res previews
[12:38:56] <taplar> but for text, dunno how you could secure that stuff
[12:39:06] <WhirledPress> you can also place a 1 px square image on top of your images to stop right-click save as...it's not gonna stop anyone with a brain, but then again, it's the internets we are talking about here
[12:39:13] <Uhkis> only way to secure your stuff is never publish it ;)
[12:39:17] <taplar> lol
[12:39:30] <taplar> wow, that would be awesome
[12:39:53] <taplar> if an image has opacity 0 can you still right click on it?
[12:40:17] <WhirledPress> correct. and then when they download it, they think it's successful, but they get nothing, really.
[12:40:26] <taplar> they get a pic of a buff dude, lmao
[12:40:36] <taplar> evil
[12:40:50] <WhirledPress> Now its super easy to go into the dev panel and get to images, but at least it stops some theft
[12:41:38] <WhirledPress> Same works for text you can place a text field over text and when someone tries to select it, it just focuses the input field.
[12:41:57] <WhirledPress> again, view source still gives up your text, but it's a start at least.
[12:42:02] <decx> like i wrote at the start, cheap tricks
[12:42:13] <WhirledPress> precisely
[12:42:20] <taplar> roi seems negligible
[12:42:35] <WhirledPress> DIdn't read back to the start, but I am sure you got it covered.
[12:43:25] <WhirledPress> data wants to be free, really.
[12:43:43] <taplar> no, Data wants to be human
[12:44:33] <decx> well lore stole datas emotion chip
[12:44:40] <taplar> lol
[12:45:36] <decx> often wrong's got a broken heart, can't even tell his boys apart
[12:51:42] <WhirledPress> can you store a function in a jquery object's data-prefixed property...or even html elements data-prefixed property?
[12:51:56] <taplar> i think so
[12:52:06] <taplar> the jquery one
[12:52:11] <decx> i don'T think functions work
[12:52:38] <taplar> doesn't the data() on a jquery object do some sort of caching so it's not 'actually' on the dom element?
[12:52:48] <decx> it does
[12:52:59] <decx> that's why you can put references, objects and all that there
[12:53:03] <taplar> yeah
[12:53:06] <decx> in the normal dataset it's juts strings
[12:53:42] <decx> hm
[12:53:44] <decx> it does work
[12:53:45] <decx> http://jsfiddle.net/kojgdw2h/
[12:53:54] <decx> well then you can put anything there ^^
[12:55:46] <WhirledPress> so if you wanted to store the funciton in the markup, you could just use a function name and reference it as the key for a array of functions. I want to have a conditional field that I can markup the condition in the html for access later by jquery.
[12:56:38] <taplar> i suppose
[12:56:55] <taplar> idk, it might be cleaner to just bind it as a custom event
[12:58:11] <taplar> $(whateverSelector).on('kick-jimmy', kickJimmy);    $(whateverSelector).trigger('kick-jimmy');
[12:58:48] <decx> also nothing wrong with just sending the element as an argument
[12:59:03] <decx> kickJimmy(selector, morearguments)
[13:00:46] <taplar> either way, is a bit more readable than say functionCollection[$element.data('functionname')]()
[13:00:52] <taplar> wtf does that do?  idk
[13:01:16] <decx> yikes
[13:01:26] <taplar> :)
[13:05:04] <taplar> no jimmys were hurt during the previous discussion...
[13:05:25] <decx> no guarantees for lack of rustling
[13:22:25] <rindolf> Hi all.

[13:26:23] <Uhkis> i'm here to what?
[13:26:23] <taplar> i know that's the wrong word.  don't care enough to correct it
[13:27:04] <taplar> statements ending in '!' :)  whatever those are called
[13:27:26] <decx> oh you mean expletive
[13:27:28] <Uhkis> ok!
[13:27:31] <decx> haha explicable ^^
[13:27:31] <taplar> lol
[13:27:44] <decx> you can'T explain that
[13:27:53] <Uhkis> i'm here to help the eu morning shift :D
[13:28:04] <rindolf> johnnyrichard: I also was interviewed today about my activity in the FOSS community. And the guy who interviewed me (who is a Sociology student) paid for our lunch. :-)
[13:29:32] <Cthulhux> sociology students with money? wow. did he actually learn a real job before?
[13:29:38] <taplar> heh, i started with expla....exple...... um...  and then i just did a donald duck on it
[13:29:53] <taplar> or porky pig, :s
[13:29:54] <taplar> hmm
[13:31:16] <decx> mixing up words AND popculture references, admit it you're an alien imposter
[13:31:32] <taplar> who you calling an imposter?
[13:32:02] <Cthulhux>  <taplar> who you call << GHOSTBUSTERS
[13:32:08] <taplar> lol
[13:33:24] <taplar> i never tire of trying to find situations to be able to spring out the "hi i'm the key master.  are you the gate keeper?!"
[13:34:00] <Cthulhux> does it work?
[13:34:05] <taplar> sometimes
[13:34:32] <Cthulhux> lol
[13:34:48] <taplar> not as a pickup line if that's what you were asking, :D
[13:35:12] <decx> yeah it only works as a pickup line if you're more subtle about it like: hey my name is vinz clortho
[13:35:29] <Uhkis> are you a god?
[13:36:14] <decx> yes
[13:38:15] <taplar> not to brag.  heh
[13:38:37] <Uhkis> decx busted for not actually seeing the movie!
[13:38:50] <decx> if anyone ask if you're a god you say yes
[13:38:51] <Uhkis> then again, they teach to always answer yes when someone asks that...
[13:43:18] <Amanej> Hello
[13:43:41] <Amanej> I am having trouble making a simple function work in wordpress
[13:44:38] <taplar> are you having issues using '$'?
[13:45:13] <taplar> wordpress operates jquery in safe mode by default i believe, so you'll have to use jQuery instead of $ or use and IIFE
[13:45:15] <Amanej> well,I am using JQuery()
[13:45:19] <taplar> good
[13:45:20] <Twirl> Hello, how can i get the document's width
[13:45:34] <taplar> oh
[13:45:38] <taplar> lowercase j?
[13:46:33] <Amanej> taplar: oh, actually no
[13:46:41] <Amanej> But its not even that I think
[13:46:54] <Amanej> I have an onclick="myfunction()"
[13:47:11] <Amanej> But when its clicked it says the function is not defined
[13:47:21] <taplar> is the function defined after that html statement?
[13:49:09] <taplar> i'm assuming it is
[13:49:19] <taplar> a better approach is to bind the function to the element in your js
[13:49:27] <taplar> separate your markup from your logic
[13:49:41] <Uhkis> how about doing a proper click event listener instead?
[13:50:07] <Amanej> yes, the function is defined after the html statement
[13:50:31] <taplar> iirc, inline binds like that want the function to already be defined
[13:56:05] <Amanej> So, not its at the top, with proper syntax :). small j instead of big J.
[13:56:36] <Amanej> Basically I want the element clicked to have its childs display = none css property changed to block
[13:56:54] <robertmaxrees> $(this).find('theChild').css('display', 'none');
[13:56:57] <Amanej> IS this ok code? function unhideAmansModal(){
[13:56:57] <Amanej> 	  jQuery(this).children(".aModal").css("display", "block");
[13:56:57] <Amanej> 	}
[13:57:06] <robertmaxrees> Amanej please don't paste into the channel btw :)
[13:57:11] <decx> inline events only look at the global scope
[13:57:12] <taplar> or use a class
[13:57:23] <decx> which one reason why you don't use them
[13:58:06] <Amanej> decx: What do you mean ?
[13:58:15] <robertmaxrees> Amanej your $(this) isn't what you think it is.
[13:58:27] <robertmaxrees> you should use jquery's .on() method for event binding instead,
[13:58:34] <momo__> Anyone online here?
[13:58:41] <momo__> I need help :(
[13:58:47] <robertmaxrees> just ask your question momo__
[13:58:48] <taplar> .parent .aModal { display: none; }  .parent.show .aModal { display: block; }  then just $(parentSelector).addClass('show');
[13:58:51] <decx> this is a prerecorded message of your prerecorded channel
[13:58:52] <robertmaxrees> if somebody can help, they will.
[14:00:30] <momo__> I'm currently using materilizecss for my website framework that uses jquery 2.1.2. It begins to have a conflict with my printhis.js v1.1 that uses jquery 1.6.4. What should I do? I need that print module for our thesis. :(
[14:00:49] <robertmaxrees> why do you need the print module?
[14:01:08] <momo__> I have a transaction page that needs printing.
[14:01:10] <decx> materialize will work just as well on the 1 branch
[14:01:20] <robertmaxrees> then use print styles.
[14:01:40] <momo__> I dunno how to implement the print styles
[14:01:44] <robertmaxrees> then learn?
[14:01:57] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, update printthis.
[14:02:02] <rindolf> momo__: you can use <link media="..."
[14:02:21] <momo__> Our defense is on 21 and I'm cramming
[14:02:23] <momo__> HAHAHAHA
[14:02:42] <robertmaxrees> uh
[14:02:42] <Amanej> robertmaxrees: So here is my starting point
[14:02:43] <momo__> The print module is just the missing piece for our thesis
[14:02:44] <Amanej> http://plnkr.co/edit/EYxBUW3tUpVeJbmpPGi5?p=catalogue
[14:02:55] <robertmaxrees> momo__ then update printthis.
[14:03:12] <Amanej> I want to use event on() binding as you said to display the relevant modal
[14:03:13] <momo__> When I use the updated one, the styles won't show
[14:03:19] <robertmaxrees> moei yo
[14:03:26] <robertmaxrees> err, momo__ there's no simple fix here.
[14:03:33] <robertmaxrees> you're going to have to write code to solve your issue.
[14:03:47] <robertmaxrees> Amanej i don't see any js in there.
[14:04:41] <momo__> imma upload a picture with the problem showing
[14:04:48] <robertmaxrees> moei
[14:04:54] <robertmaxrees> wtf why does that keep happening.
[14:05:03] <robertmaxrees> momo__ screenshots aren't helpful.  make a jsfiddle.
[14:05:24] <decx> what you client doesnt tabcomplete to the most recent writers
[14:05:38] <robertmaxrees> decx nope.
[14:05:43] <decx> well get to it
[14:05:48] <robertmaxrees> i'll switch to a new client one of these days.
[14:06:05] <decx> https://github.com/jasonday/printThis/blob/master/printThis.js
[14:06:12] <decx> what a weird ass plugin
[14:06:16] <robertmaxrees> heh.
[14:06:23] <robertmaxrees> the docs looks funky, too.
[14:06:29] <robertmaxrees> lots of effort to get print styles.
[14:06:40] <momo__> is it a junk code?
[14:06:53] <decx> can't tell yet, but it's not great
[14:06:55] <robertmaxrees> it's totally unnecessary.  you just need some print styles.
[14:07:14] <Amanej> robertmaxrees: http://plnkr.co/edit/EYxBUW3tUpVeJbmpPGi5
[14:07:25] <decx> yeah just start printing to pdf and then add a mediaquery for print to move stuff around as you wish
[14:07:43] <taplar> Amanej: you need a document ready if the script is before the body
[14:07:50] <robertmaxrees> Amanej a few problems here.  first, use the script.js file.
[14:07:54] <robertmaxrees> second, you need a document ready.
[14:07:59] <momo__> anyone here that can show me how a print style works?
[14:08:10] <decx> same as other styles
[14:08:11] <robertmaxrees> ask #css
[14:08:15] <momo__> or any jquery print plugin?
[14:08:19] <robertmaxrees> and search google ;)
[14:08:41] <momo__> tried google, didn't gave me any results on jquery
[14:08:42] <momo__> haha
[14:08:48] <robertmaxrees> because it's a css topic.
[14:08:51] <robertmaxrees> you need to learn some css.
[14:08:54] <decx> there's no synergy between clientside scripts and printing unless you create a pdf
[14:08:56] <robertmaxrees> not use a juery plugin.
[14:09:27] <momo__> imma switch to the css channel. brb
[14:09:28] <decx> that would probably be nice for you tho
[14:09:34] <decx> grab you data and use pdf.js or something
[14:10:22] <decx> your your your
[14:10:30] <taplar> woah
[14:10:30] <robertmaxrees> nah you is funnier.
[14:10:33] <decx> damnit, somehow in a sentence i'm lacking the r
[14:10:35] <taplar> who broke decx?
[14:10:53] <decx> ok i'll stick to you
[14:11:02] <taplar> *grin* yeah you will
[14:11:04] <decx> or maybe play up my italian heritage and use youse
[14:11:17] <momo__> imma try that pdf thing
[14:11:40] <momo__> is pdf useful for saving transactions other that printing it?
[14:11:51] <Amanej> How do I get it to display block the child of the '.servicesbox' cliked ?
[14:11:53] <Amanej> http://plnkr.co/edit/EYxBUW3tUpVeJbmpPGi5
[14:11:54] <robertmaxrees> "saving transactions"?
[14:12:07] <momo__> transaction records*
[14:12:16] <robertmaxrees> momo__ saving to where?
[14:12:17] <decx> are you building a shop checkout for school?
[14:12:18] <robertmaxrees> Amanej you use .find()
[14:12:20] <robertmaxrees> $(this).find()
[14:12:37] <momo__> i'm building a warehouse management system'
[14:12:52] <robertmaxrees> momo__ hoo boy.  good luck with that.
[14:12:57] <robertmaxrees> and what kind of transaction records?
[14:13:06] <robertmaxrees> like, would this be better on the server-side?
[14:13:09] <momo__> mostly on the pick and pack list
[14:13:11] <decx> in that case i guess building a pdf IS a good choice
[14:13:21] <momo__> and the receiving and return records
[14:14:09] <momo__> we're nearly finished. our project is on 98%
[14:14:17] <robertmaxrees> which really means it's at 75%
[14:14:19] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[14:14:23] <taplar> saving transactions in a pdf, :s
[14:14:44] <momo__> oh god
[14:14:57] <momo__> please don't ruin my spirit
[14:14:59] <momo__> hahahaha
[14:15:00] <decx> we're nearly done, only it doesnt work yet ^^
[14:15:06] <robertmaxrees> lol
[14:15:11] <taplar> screw databases.  i'ma do pdfs
[14:15:12] <robertmaxrees> welcome to development.
[14:15:19] <robertmaxrees> ^ why aren't you using a db?
[14:15:25] <robertmaxrees> and then generating PDFs out of that?
[14:15:51] <decx> i was assuming that's already being done
[14:16:01] <robertmaxrees> what's the point of the PDFs in this case?
[14:16:11] <momo__> we're done with our databases
[14:16:14] <decx> no idea, some kind of papertrail
[14:16:22] <momo__> what's a papertrail?
[14:16:26] <robertmaxrees> momo__ what's the point of the PDF?
[14:16:29] <decx> a trail, from paper
[14:16:32] <taplar> lol
[14:16:36] <momo__> lol
[14:16:38] <taplar> wow
[14:16:52] <momo__> hmm to print and save some of our transactions
[14:16:58] <robertmaxrees> why?
[14:17:06] <momo__> so that they can have a physical backup
[14:17:08] <taplar> backups man, backups
[14:17:15] <momo__> backups*
[14:17:16] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[14:17:22] <robertmaxrees> that's not a good way to solve that problem.
[14:17:28] <momo__> why?
[14:17:28] <robertmaxrees> that should be a server-side job.
[14:17:31] <taplar> no, i'm agreeing with robert
[14:17:34] <robertmaxrees> not client side.
[14:17:38] <taplar> you should back up your database, not do paper
[14:17:44] <robertmaxrees> ^
[14:17:55] <robertmaxrees> i can't think of a case where having paper copies of all of that is useful.
[14:18:12] <momo__> we have a backup on our server side
[14:18:18] <robertmaxrees> then you don't need the PDFs.
[14:18:24] <robertmaxrees> it's an extra step that's unnecessary.
[14:18:35] <decx> people like to have something in hand even if it doesnt matter
[14:18:45] <robertmaxrees> sure, then make them grab that info instead of doing it client side.
[14:18:56] <momo__> ugh we need to print the pack list for our delivery boxes
[14:19:05] <taplar> now that makes sense
[14:19:10] <robertmaxrees> still sounds like a server-side thing to me.
[14:19:11] <robertmaxrees> but okay.
[14:19:12] <momo__> we also print for our receipts
[14:19:23] <decx> just write some printstyles ;)
[14:19:24] <Amanej> ok, so this is working: http://plnkr.co/edit/EYxBUW3tUpVeJbmpPGi5?p=preview
[14:19:34] <robertmaxrees> aaah plunkr is sooo slowwww.
[14:19:34] <taplar> printing pack lists, shipping manifestos and all that, that makes sense
[14:19:37] <momo__> and we also like to have the user to have freedom in printing
[14:19:37] <momo__> hahahaha
[14:19:48] <robertmaxrees> momo__ that's... going to be painful.
[14:19:55] <momo__> i know
[14:20:03] <robertmaxrees> printing is hard.  generate preformatted PDFs server-side and call it a day.
[14:20:04] <momo__> too much costs for the company
[14:20:19] <momo__> i'll try to do the pdfs
[14:20:31] <momo__> thank you for giving me the idea
[14:20:58] <robertmaxrees> Amanej http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/wL2rma1t/1/
[14:21:00] <robertmaxrees> much easier.
[14:21:37] <momo__> any suggestions in converting html divs to pdf?
[14:29:19] <Amanej> Thanks alot everybody
[14:29:23] <Amanej> Its working now :)
[14:29:29] <Amanej> robertmaxrees: thanks
[14:29:43] <Amanej> Now I will just have to make a delete button and fix some css issues
[14:37:33] <WhirledPress> Anybody know of a decent jquery library that emulates the clear field button on ios devices for text inputs?
[14:38:09] <taplar_> $(':input').val(''); ?
[14:38:19] <robertmaxrees> i'd select through a class or ID, but yeah.
[14:38:46] <WhirledPress> It's not that I can't write one myself, it's that I want the cute little x icon inside the input element
[14:39:10] <robertmaxrees> then find an icon to use and do that.
[14:39:14] <bango2> lol
[14:39:18] <decx> what a weird ux, how often do you delete a field
[14:39:23] <robertmaxrees> ^
[14:39:34] <robertmaxrees> also, users on other platforms may/may not know what that does.
[14:39:37] <WhirledPress> and I need to to handle all of the edge cases like the fact that it loses focus (forces validation) when clicked.
[14:43:06] <taplar> WhirledPress: are you talking about the one under the "Color" section? http://demos.jquerymobile.com/1.4.5/textinput/
[14:44:15] <decx> huh, how do i access the system color picker?
[14:44:55] <decx> oh type="color" is supported now
[14:44:56] <decx> neat
[14:45:04] <taplar> huh
[14:45:31] <taplar> no longer a need to pop open an mspaint?  heh
[14:45:37] <decx> http://jsfiddle.net/J972H/
[14:45:38] <Amanej> I am having trouble closing the modal discussed earlier: http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/wL2rma1t/1/
[14:45:44] <Amanej> What can I do ?
[14:45:51] <taplar> wow
[14:46:31] <taplar> Amanej: how do you want it closed?
[14:47:18] <taplar> are you wanting it to toggle open/close on repeated clicks?
[14:47:22] <Amanej> I want it set to display none
[14:47:35] <Amanej> its parent element
[14:47:41] <Amanej> thats why I am using parent()
[14:47:45] <taplar> no, what user action should close it?
[14:49:00] <bfig_> hello, I'm having some issues with the jquery droppables. The drop zone is not working correctly. I've tried changing the toleranceType but it hasn't changed anything. I want it to be activated when the cursor overlaps with the hitbox, but currently it is something like 'hovering in the center of the cloned div'
[14:55:52] <Amanej> taplar: clicking on the closeButton
[14:56:15] <taplar> ok, i don't see a close button in that fiddle
[14:57:12] <taplar> *that you linked
[14:59:55] <Amanej> oh, I am sorry. I hadnt pressed update: http://jsfiddle.net/wL2rma1t/2/
[15:00:49] <taplar> k, so your event is on the closeButton and your trying to look for a parent with class closeButton
[15:01:13] <taplar> your really looking for the parent with class Modal, no?
[15:03:29] <Amanej> taplar: yes
[15:03:44] <taplar> ok, so adjust your code to do that
[15:04:40] <Amanej> Hmm, I did
[15:04:46] <Amanej> did seem to change anything
[15:05:10] <taplar> what do you have now
[15:05:33] <Amanej> And also it seems to run the first function as well
[15:05:46] <taplar> yep, we'll deal with that next
[15:05:47] <Amanej> http://jsfiddle.net/wL2rma1t/3/
[15:05:52] <Amanej> didnt seem*
[15:07:05] <taplar> your first closeButton has a lowercase b on it
[15:09:00] <taplar> and to stop the bubbling of the event that is re-opening it after it closes, you'll want to pass in the event to the close handler and do event.stopPropagation() on it
[15:09:42] <taplar> otherwise you could change up the logic a bit to avoid doing that
[15:10:39] <WhirledPress> When I create an element and attach it to the dom, how do I get it to apply predefined styles? I'm using fontAwesome, and my icons are showing up in markup, but not when attached programmatically.
[15:11:23] <taplar> WhirledPress: styles should apply to the element by default
[15:11:43] <WhirledPress> found it..thanks for the reply.
[15:22:15] <Amanej> taplar: I didnt understand the second part
[15:22:23] <Amanej> and to stop the bubbling of the event that is re-opening it after it closes, you'll want to pass in the event to the close handler and do event.stopPropagation() on i
[15:25:27] <taplar> k
[15:26:10] <taplar> so when you do $(selector).on(event, function(){}); to bind an event handler, there is an optional parameter you can give it
[15:26:25] <taplar> $(selector).on('click', function(event){});
[15:26:39] <hlvwrk> Anybody familiar with Crypto JS library in here?
[15:26:40] <taplar> you can name it whatever, but the first element is the event itself that is being handled
[15:27:11] <taplar> to stop that event from bubbling up further in the dom to continue processing you can do: event.stopPropagation();
[15:28:21] <Amanej> hmm, ok,
[15:29:18] <Amanej> I didnt quite understand how to use that in this scenario
[15:29:27] <Amanej> I have the documentation page for it open
[15:30:04] <taplar> so for your case, the event that is doing the closing is bubbling up to the other handler and re-opening it
[15:30:12] <taplar> so you have to stop it in the close handler
[15:30:24] <Amanej> jQuery( ".closeButton").on( "click", function(event.stopPropagation();){
[15:30:29] <Amanej> like that ?^^
[15:30:42] <taplar> no, that's malformed function definition
[15:30:47] <Amanej> right
[15:30:53] <taplar> your definition will remain the same, just pass in the event parameter
[15:31:02] <taplar> and then do the stopPropagation function on it
[15:33:06] <Amanej> taplar: yeeey! That worked!
[15:33:16] <taplar> :)
[15:39:50] <bfig> hello, I'm having some issues with the jquery droppables. The drop zone is not working correctly. I've tried changing the toleranceType but it hasn't changed anything. I want it to be activated when the cursor overlaps with the hitbox, but currently it is something like 'hovering in the center of the cloned div'
[15:41:35] <theery> I'm using the Dragula library, and getting a DOM element on drop, but when I try to convert that element to a jQuery element, it returns null. Any ideas why? https://gist.github.com/macmartine/0055a7c83072aa7232f4
[15:41:40] <taplar> bfig: got a fiddle?
[15:42:18] <taplar> theery: what is 'el'?  are you sure it's not the event?
[15:42:41] <taplar> first parameter of an event handler is usually the event
[15:42:49] <theery> @taplar : See the output in the gist. It's an 'li' element
[15:42:50] <robertmaxrees> could be different since it's dragula.
[15:43:13] <taplar> hmm
[15:43:22] <robertmaxrees> (make a fiddle)
[15:43:34] <theery> Strange thing is, when I set a breakpoint, and do it in console, it works fine.
[15:44:04] <taplar> it's strange to me that it prints the html
[15:44:10] <taplar> instead of like [Object object]
[15:44:46] <theery> I can also tell you this works, in case it gives any clues: el.parentElement.removeChild(el);
[15:45:38] <taplar> i second roberts suggestion.
[16:02:43] <nitrospectide> is there a simple, native way to do cookies in jQuery?
[16:02:56] <robertmaxrees> those statements are at odds with one another.
[16:02:56] <taplar> localStorage and sessionStorage are easy
[16:03:05] <robertmaxrees> "native in jquery", no.
[16:03:10] <robertmaxrees> because that sentence is contradictory :)
[16:03:32] <nitrospectide> robertmaxrees: so it requires a plugin
[16:03:35] <robertmaxrees> if you mean "without extra plugins", no - you'll have to use the raw API the browser gives you instead.
[16:03:44] <robertmaxrees> it doesn't require a plugin unless you absolutely HAVE to use jquery.
[16:04:20] <nitrospectide> I've never done a cookie before, and just need to make sure that a modal window doesn't show on every page lod - just once a week
[16:04:37] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/cookie
[16:04:37] <robertmaxrees> :)
[16:05:36] <nitrospectide> robertmaxrees: That sets a cookie by document? How can I set a sitewide cookie?
[16:05:47] <robertmaxrees> read the docs duder.
[16:05:52] <robertmaxrees> it explains all of that.
[16:06:33] <nitrospectide> robertmaxrees: will do
[16:24:39] <WhirledPress> does $(select).map() return an array or a jquery object? why is var parts=$("sel").map(something); var result=parts.join(""); giving the error that parts.join() is not a function?
[16:25:21] <robertmaxrees> because it's not an array.
[16:25:23] <robertmaxrees> it's a jquery object.
[16:25:26] <robertmaxrees> in both cases.
[16:25:40] <WhirledPress> dangit. I thought map gave an array...thanks.
[16:25:49] <robertmaxrees> you can get one by chaining .get() on there.
[16:26:04] <robertmaxrees> .map(function() {}).get()
[16:32:10] <WhirledPress> gawd I hate css...
[16:32:20] <taplar> ?
[16:50:32] <WhirledPress> $("input").first()....how does jquery determine which one is first? I thought it was in the order presented in the dom..
[16:50:43] <robertmaxrees> the "first" one in the document.
[16:50:46] <robertmaxrees> but that's ephemeral.
[16:50:55] <robertmaxrees> per the markup.
[16:50:57] <robertmaxrees> not visually.
[16:51:12] <robertmaxrees> also, "first" according to what rules?  left to right?  right to left?
[16:52:33] <WhirledPress> I got it. I was selecting $(".inputfield input").first() when I should have been selecting $(".inputfield").first().find("input");
[16:52:46] <robertmaxrees> i'd try to use classes and things instead.
[16:52:50] <robertmaxrees> nut cool
[17:43:59] <z1haze> how do i gather mysql data inside of a js file? Im trying to built a chart and need my data points that are stored in the database
[17:44:16] <robertmaxrees> use a backend language to then output json with your data
[17:49:32] <z1haze> Well I'm using php, but thats not what i meant. I know how to actually make it work, but I dont want all my js and stuff in my main file, i was to extract it away to a js file
[17:51:55] <robertmaxrees> errr, you can't?
[17:52:13] <robertmaxrees> you'll need to write it out somewhere.
[17:52:24] <robertmaxrees> so you'll need to setup an endpoint or something to output json.
[17:52:44] <robertmaxrees> having that output in your page is fine.  otherwise expose an api that you can hit instead.
[17:53:42] <z1haze> So i have to have all of this js in my main file then?
[17:53:51] <robertmaxrees> i think you're confused.
[17:53:55] <z1haze> Definitely
[17:54:08] <robertmaxrees> you could create an include file of some kind that outputs the json into a script tag.
[17:54:18] <robertmaxrees> or you could create an api endpoint you could hit with ajax.
[17:54:32] <z1haze> its using googles library
[17:54:39] <z1haze> the visualization one
[17:54:43] <robertmaxrees> but writing out a file with that data isn't going to work since you can't generate/read them fast enough.
[17:54:52] <robertmaxrees> so you need to write that data out to the page or create the ajax endpoint.
[17:55:14] <z1haze> this is what i want to happen http://hastebin.com/ejolarikej.js
[17:55:19] <z1haze> but like you said, it wont work
[17:55:27] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[17:55:30] <robertmaxrees> that's not really what you want.
[17:55:33] <z1haze> i still dont get what you're suggesting though, how do i pass this data to it
[17:55:42] <robertmaxrees> to what?  the db?
[17:55:45] <robertmaxrees> or the js?
[17:55:47] <z1haze> to the js
[17:55:52] <robertmaxrees> you read the JSON.
[17:55:57] <z1haze> right now its working all in the main page
[17:56:04] <robertmaxrees> right now you're intermingling php and js.
[17:56:07] <robertmaxrees> that's bad.
[17:56:15] <z1haze> i execute my php and just inline it with the js it works, but when i want to extract the js away, it break for obvious reasons
[17:56:18] <z1haze> yea
[17:56:19] <z1haze> i know
[17:56:21] <z1haze> but it was working
[17:56:34] <robertmaxrees> and now you've run into a natural limitation :)
[17:56:46] <robertmaxrees> so start by abstracting this - make your JS pure and in its own js file.
[17:56:49] <z1haze> well i mean, i could just leave it alone, but i want it to be neat
[17:56:52] <robertmaxrees> then read from JSON you're outputting.
[17:57:01] <z1haze> can you elaborate on that
[17:57:08] <robertmaxrees> on what?
[17:57:13] <z1haze> the whole json part
[17:57:16] <z1haze> im not outputting any json
[17:57:25] <robertmaxrees> you should be.
[17:57:28] <robertmaxrees> that's my entire point
[17:57:33] <z1haze> mine too, i need help on it
[17:57:40] <z1haze> hence elaborate
[17:57:45] <robertmaxrees> so you need help on outputting JSON in php?
[17:57:56] <z1haze> oh
[17:58:00] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[17:58:06] <z1haze> well thats easy
[17:58:14] <z1haze> you mean like json_encode or whatever
[17:58:17] <robertmaxrees> sure.
[17:58:23] <robertmaxrees> start by outputting all the data you need in some semi-sensible format./
[17:58:27] <robertmaxrees> the rest is just reading that data.
[17:58:30] <z1haze> ok, so after doing that, i still have a php variable and i have js.
[17:58:32] <robertmaxrees> instead of writing in directly to the js.
[17:58:41] <robertmaxrees> the js and the php don't communicate btw.
[17:58:45] <z1haze> $var = json_encode(php stuff)
[17:58:45] <robertmaxrees> they don't understand each other.
[17:58:50] <z1haze> $var is still php
[17:59:15] <robertmaxrees> then you output $var into your document into a script tag and assign it to a var.
[17:59:31] <robertmaxrees> window.myData = <% $var %> or whatever the delimiter is in php.
[17:59:45] <z1haze> i think I understand what you are saying.. you mean to just make an ajax call in my js include file that returns the $result in json form
[17:59:53] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[17:59:56] <robertmaxrees> you could do that instead.
[18:00:04] <robertmaxrees> you could setup an endpoint for all of this.
[18:00:19] <z1haze> didnt you just mix php and js though
[18:00:25] <robertmaxrees> to output data.
[18:00:29] <robertmaxrees> dynamically writing logic is bad.,
[18:00:40] <robertmaxrees> outputting data (json) isn't.
[18:01:19] <z1haze> i understand the concept (i think) for the ajax call and return the result in json
[18:01:25] <z1haze> other than that i dont follow
[18:01:58] <z1haze> i dont want ANY <script>inline js</script in my main page
[18:02:04] <z1haze> i want to just include everything
[18:02:07] <robertmaxrees> you cannot avoid that in this case.
[18:02:11] <z1haze> damn
[18:02:16] <robertmaxrees> that's not a problem.
[18:02:23] <robertmaxrees> https://bpaste.net/show/4e1ec9e4f90d you could do this.
[18:02:24] <z1haze> well its a ton of stuff
[18:02:35] <robertmaxrees> like, literally that simple.
[18:02:47] <z1haze> what does window.myData give me though
[18:02:52] <robertmaxrees> a global JS var.
[18:03:01] <z1haze> so i can then use myData in the script src=" file
[18:03:11] <robertmaxrees> yeah - access it through window though.
[18:03:13] <robertmaxrees> so it's explicit.
[18:03:15] <robertmaxrees> but that's one way.
[18:03:19] <z1haze> thats not too bad
[18:32:25] <robertmaxrees> sleeeeeeepy
[18:34:04] <z1haze> maybe you should sleep xD
[18:34:08] <z1haze> i cant figure this stupid thing out
[18:34:11] <robertmaxrees> hah, not this weekend ;)
[18:34:15] <robertmaxrees> what stupid thing?
[18:36:30] <z1haze> extracting my backend code from this chart
[18:37:24] <z1haze> the more easy of the charts: http://dpaste.com/22S8AJJ
[18:37:58] <robertmaxrees> think of it this way: any play you have a php tag outputting something, you instead want to use a variable.
[18:38:00] <z1haze> i just really want to pull this out of the main file
[18:38:17] <z1haze> right, but i have a foreach loop
[18:38:21] <robertmaxrees> why?
[18:38:22] <droid909> guys if you have a task, and u just hate doing it, how to start loving it, becouse u need it to be done?
[18:38:29] <robertmaxrees> and where?  that while loop?
[18:38:34] <robertmaxrees> droid909 like what?
[18:38:35] <z1haze> yea, sorry my while loop
[18:38:54] <robertmaxrees> z1haze do you know how to get that into a php array or whatever?
[18:39:03] <z1haze> sure
[18:39:04] <robertmaxrees> because you could easily json encode that, too.
[18:39:13] <robertmaxrees> and add that to your object.
[18:39:15] <z1haze> so push it to an array then encode the array?
[18:39:19] <robertmaxrees> sure.
[18:39:21] <z1haze> k
[18:39:23] <robertmaxrees> or whatever format it should be.
[18:39:42] <droid909> robertmaxrees: a certain task, gui + backend
[18:40:00] <robertmaxrees> droid909 that's really vague, but I put on music and do it.
[18:40:22] <robertmaxrees> z1haze btw - any time you have $(window).resize(function(){ drawChart(); }); or whatever, you can just do $(window).resize(drawChart);
[18:40:27] <droid909> robertmaxrees: i just comment the code right now, trying to love it
[18:40:47] <robertmaxrees> droid909 i don't really understand what you mean i guess.
[18:41:15] <robertmaxrees> droid909 i like doing development work.  there are some parts i enjoy less than others but i like solving problems/fixing things.
[18:41:18] <droid909> robertmaxrees: don't you ever have a situation when u just don't wanna code
[18:41:26] <robertmaxrees> a few times, but rarely.
[18:41:27] <droid909> robertmaxrees: a certain stuff
[18:41:43] <robertmaxrees> and in those cases, i just put on music and get it done.
[18:41:48] <droid909> robertmaxrees: i guess this is because i worked on weekends
[18:41:49] <robertmaxrees> not all of development is glamourous.
[18:41:56] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[18:42:00] <droid909> robertmaxrees: all work and no play ...
[18:42:11] <robertmaxrees> why are you working on weekends?
[18:42:18] <robertmaxrees> that's a great way to burn yourself out.
[18:42:26] <droid909> robertmaxrees: i guess this happened
[18:42:34] <droid909> robertmaxrees: i had to
[18:42:38] <robertmaxrees> why?
[18:42:45] <robertmaxrees> crunch time?
[18:43:01] <robertmaxrees> sometimes you're going to have to pull long hours.  other times you won't.
[18:43:04] <droid909> robertmaxrees: deadline
[18:43:06] <robertmaxrees> welcome to adulthood :)
[18:43:23] <droid909> robertmaxrees: pff
[18:43:34] <robertmaxrees> if you're working multiple weekends in a row, get worried.  but it's a give and take.
[18:44:02] <droid909> robertmaxrees: how to fix my condition
[18:44:09] <robertmaxrees> burnout?  stop working for a few days.
[18:44:17] <robertmaxrees> and do something else.
[18:44:42] <z1haze> ok so robertmaxrees i have a php array now of all of those values
[18:44:49] <z1haze> now what do i need to do with it
[18:45:00] <robertmaxrees> z1haze so output them into a js var.  then use that js var instead of what you were doing befor.e
[18:45:01] <robertmaxrees> bam done.
[18:45:13] <gambl0re> hello robertmatrix!...long time no see
[18:45:22] <z1haze> not sure how to do that
[18:45:29] <robertmaxrees> i showed you earlier.
[18:45:33] <gambl0re> robertmatrix is a close personal friend of mine....
[18:46:17] <z1haze> no i mean hwo to convert it to a js array
[18:46:23] <robertmaxrees> your json encode.
[18:47:12] <robertmaxrees> basically, you should never be outputting data yourself - you want to create the right data in php and then use something like json_encode or whatever and let that handle the output.
[18:51:12] <z1haze> when i json_encode it it doesnt format it like a js array
[18:51:19] <z1haze> its just abig ass json string
[18:51:29] <robertmaxrees> sounds like you'll need to JSON.parse()
[18:51:47] <z1haze> ah, so encode it, then parse it
[18:52:06] <robertmaxrees> the json encode is just printing it out to the apge.
[18:52:11] <z1haze> JSON.parse(<?php echo json_encode($values);?>);
[18:52:11] <robertmaxrees> the js needs to parse that string.
[18:52:18] <z1haze> such a mess
[18:52:18] <robertmaxrees> sure?
[18:52:29] <robertmaxrees> or JSON.parse() it where you want to use it.
[18:52:37] <robertmaxrees> or read the json docs for php and go from there.
[18:54:28] <z1haze> this is what i need to end up with ['Nov 12 09:38 EST', 13639],['Nov 13 09:25 EST', 23566],...
[18:54:37] <robertmaxrees> then output that?
[18:54:39] <robertmaxrees> that's a php issue.
[18:54:54] <z1haze> i wouldnt say its a php issue
[18:54:59] <z1haze> its just an inbetween thing
[18:54:59] <robertmaxrees> sure it is.
[18:55:04] <robertmaxrees> json_encode9) is php.
[18:55:13] <z1haze> json encode does what its supposed to do
[18:55:20] <z1haze> it turns it into JSON
[18:55:21] <robertmaxrees> you said it's not outputting in the right format.
[18:55:26] <z1haze> sure it is, as JSON
[18:55:30] <robertmaxrees> *sigh*
[18:55:32] <robertmaxrees> no.
[18:55:37] <z1haze> json != js array
[18:55:40] <robertmaxrees> correct.
[18:55:44] <robertmaxrees> you have a particular format in mind.  it is not doing that format.
[18:55:46] <z1haze> therefore its not the correct way to do it
[18:55:50] <robertmaxrees> so fix that.
[18:55:53] <robertmaxrees> that's what i've been saying.
[18:56:00] <z1haze> its not any particular format, its just a standard javascript array
[18:56:02] <robertmaxrees> your issue is with the thing outputting json.
[18:56:02] <z1haze> isnt it?
[18:56:17] <robertmaxrees> you need ['Nov 12 09:38 EST', 13639],['Nov 13 09:25 EST', 23566],... and are not getting that, right?
[18:56:27] <robertmaxrees> an array of arrays?
[18:56:53] <z1haze> well from this way it doesnt even look like an array of arrays
[18:56:58] <robertmaxrees> right.
[18:56:59] <z1haze> it seems just like a bunch of arrays
[18:57:06] <robertmaxrees> so you need to figure out the correct way to output it.
[18:57:19] <robertmaxrees> that is an issue with the php side.
[18:57:22] <robertmaxrees> not an "in between" issue.
[18:57:33] <z1haze> i can format it how i want in php
[18:57:36] <z1haze> its js that i cant format it lol
[18:57:42] <robertmaxrees> again
[18:57:46] <z1haze> echo "['" . date_format($date, 'M j h:i T') . "', " . $data->players_online . "],"; is the way i format from php
[18:57:47] <robertmaxrees> that is an issue with the php side of things.
[18:57:55] <robertmaxrees> i wouldn't do that personally.
[18:57:59] <robertmaxrees> but whatevs.
[18:58:07] <z1haze> im not planning to..
[18:58:11] <z1haze> im juist saying i can format it just fine with php
[18:58:18] <z1haze> you keep saying its php formatting but it isnt
[18:58:30] <robertmaxrees> but the json encode is not outputting in the format that you need, correct?
[18:58:44] <z1haze> its outputting it as.. JSON
[18:58:51] <robertmaxrees> but not in the correct format.
[18:59:33] <z1haze> its in the correct json format, which is all that its supposed to do man
[18:59:47] <z1haze> im not expecting json_encode to do anything more
[18:59:47] <robertmaxrees> but it's not what you need on the js side?
[18:59:50] <z1haze> right
[18:59:54] <z1haze> but im not blaming php for it
[18:59:58] <robertmaxrees> but it's a php issue.
[19:00:02] <z1haze> im just saying theres more that needs to be done to it
[19:00:06] <robertmaxrees> right.
[19:00:08] <robertmaxrees> on the php side of things.
[19:00:21] <z1haze> have an idea though
[19:02:05] <z1haze> if it were an array of arrays how i thought it would be, it wouldnt be much issue, but its not like that at all
[19:02:23] <robertmaxrees> right.  so you need to figure out how to make php output it in that format.
[19:03:31] <z1haze> i already have, remember
[19:03:38] <robertmaxrees> i give up,.
[19:03:40] <robertmaxrees> you're not listening.
[19:03:41] <robertmaxrees> enjoy.
[19:03:48] <z1haze> heh
[19:04:05] <z1haze> i didnt make this stuff, im just doing the front end design for a site and trying to clean it up
[19:04:13] <z1haze> so personally ive never even used this library
[19:04:22] <robertmaxrees> and i'm trying to explain to you the smart way to do it.
[19:04:40] <robertmaxrees> but you're presuming and assuming things.
[19:05:04] <z1haze> ah! i may have found something
[19:06:57] <z1haze> https://developers.google.com/chart/interactive/docs/datatables_dataviews?hl=en says that putting false after all the data means the first row contains the labels, and not data.. just like the code thats on my page.. however he doesnt have false in here but it still seems to work
[19:27:55] <z1haze> robertmaxrees, like this? http://dpaste.com/0HJR66R
[19:28:13] <z1haze> i should be able to use window.chart1 from an included file then?
[19:28:36] <robertmaxrees> ew.
[19:28:45] <z1haze> what!?
[19:28:45] <robertmaxrees> this is exactly what i was trying to get you to avoid.
[19:28:49] <robertmaxrees> but you didn't want to listen.
[19:28:52] <z1haze> how didnt i listen
[19:28:55] <z1haze> what the fk?
[19:29:08] <robertmaxrees> you're outputting data and then transforming it in js.
[19:29:16] <robertmaxrees> just output it the right way the first time.
[19:29:18] <z1haze> https://bpaste.net/show/4e1ec9e4f90d
[19:29:49] <z1haze> no im taking json, and transforming it to how i need it
[19:30:03] <robertmaxrees> that is almost exactly what i just said.
[19:30:11] <robertmaxrees> you are transforming it in the js side of things.
[19:30:21] <robertmaxrees> don't do that - just output it the right way the first time./
[19:31:09] <z1haze> ..
[19:31:16] <z1haze> im outputting raw json
[19:31:23] <robertmaxrees> right, in the incorrect format.
[19:31:29] <z1haze> no, as JSON
[19:31:35] <robertmaxrees> you're convoluting this.
[19:31:36] <z1haze> stop saying its wrong, lol
[19:31:40] <robertmaxrees> you are outputting JSON in the incorrect format.
[19:31:51] <robertmaxrees> the JSON that is output is not structured the way you need it to be structured.
[19:31:51] <z1haze> theres only 1 format to json?
[19:31:57] <robertmaxrees> no.
[19:32:16] <robertmaxrees> the format that you are having the php spit out is not the format you actually need.
[19:32:28] <robertmaxrees> you are manually modifying it in javascript to get it there.
[19:33:46] <robertmaxrees> so remove that intermediary step.  this is literally what i've been telling you to do this entire time.
[19:35:24] <z1haze> yea i now what you are saying.
[19:35:35] <z1haze> may as well just store is as a big long string then
[19:35:41] <z1haze> that just seems terrible
[19:36:28] <robertmaxrees> it really isn't.
[19:36:32] <robertmaxrees> then your JS can consume data.
[19:50:06] <z1haze> robertmaxrees, when i log to console the contents of my new data, it shows a bunch of arrays like i want
[19:50:27] <z1haze> but when i just output the contents of my new data to where it belongs, it leaves out all of the []
[19:51:24] * robertmaxrees looks in his crystal ball
[19:51:25] <robertmaxrees> hrmmm.
[19:51:33] <robertmaxrees> i can't see it.
[20:01:41] <z1haze> resize
[20:01:56] <z1haze> $(window).resize(drawChart); does this supposed to be missing the () on the function?
[21:24:55] <z1haze> i cant stop getting Cannot read property '0' of undefined from googles charts lib.. i dont understand
[21:25:09] <z1haze> i output my json and check it against a validation, and other people's format and its exactly the same
[21:47:10] <z1haze> will someone please look at my json and tell me why i could be getting cannot read property of undefined from google charts?
[22:56:23] <Ou42> SirLagz: are you here?
[22:57:42] <SirLagz> Ou42: yes
[22:58:06] <Ou42> SirLagz: cool. if you got a moment, a follow up to yesterday's talk.
[22:58:27] <SirLagz> Ou42: yeah I've got a moment
[22:59:19] <Ou42> SirLagz: I blanked yesterday... but saving "blobs" is that saving them locally or on the server?
[22:59:51] <Ou42> re: the notepad webapp
[23:00:34] <SirLagz> Ou42: server
[23:00:59] <SirLagz> Ou42: or you could work out how to do it locally if you wanted
[23:01:10] <SirLagz> Ou42: totally up to you :D
[23:01:17] <SirLagz> Ou42: the beauty of building your own webapp
[23:01:51] <SirLagz> lunch. brb.
[23:01:54] <Ou42> SirLagz: heh. I think. ;) wasn't sure about where to store the "app's" file(s).
[23:02:11] <Ou42> ok
[23:23:40] <bfig> hello, I'm having some issues with the jquery droppables. The drop zone is not working correctly. I've tried changing the toleranceType but it hasn't changed anything. I want it to be activated when the cursor overlaps with the hitbox, but currently it is something like 'hovering in the center of the cloned div'
[23:25:18] <WhirledPress> bfig, create a jsfiddle to duplicate the problem and post the link here.
[23:27:13] <bfig> WhirledPress: I can give you access to the server I'm having issues with, but it's a knockoutjs custom binding that is giving me the issue
[23:27:22] <bfig> so i don't know how to easily replicate it
[23:27:39] <bfig> http://ec2-52-27-6-23.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com:8069/web#action=467 user admin:admin
[23:27:56] <bfig> the draggables are the boxes on the right, the droppables are the button style trucks
[23:30:55] <WhirledPress> why all the different zindeces?
[23:31:11] <bfig> i dunno, they are from some of the many frameworks interacting
[23:31:21] <unrecited> hm
[23:31:24] <bfig> they appear everywhere and are not part of the code I wrote, they are generated automagically
[23:32:02] <WhirledPress> have you considered modifying the zindex of your draggable and droppable to see if that is the problem. I really have no idea where to start.
[23:32:27] <bfig> WhirledPress: could you engage the droppable? it is doable, just drag and center the droppable in the buttons
[23:33:38] <WhirledPress> I can't get the droppables to drop
[23:33:45] <bfig> i don't think the z-indexes are a problem... the drop hitbox is just... I don't know how it's computed
[23:33:59] <bfig> make sure to center the helper *right on top* of the buttons
[23:34:18] <bfig> so the cursor is abit on the left, close to the div border, and slightly lower than the button height
[23:34:36] <bfig> like you were dropping a box inside another box (only the boxes are inverted in size hah)
[23:35:53] <bfig> the drop doesn't do anything, but the helper changes the text displayed when it's on top of the drop zone. the activation itself is not an issue, the issue is the drop hitbox
[23:36:58] <bfig> a better way to state is, align the helper with the blue buttons, then move left and right until the helper changes
[23:38:45] <WhirledPress> When I dlick on an item to the right and start to drag the text reads "Schedule..." then somewhere it changes back.
[23:39:55] <WhirledPress> maybe your buttons are overlapping
[23:40:57] <WhirledPress> I put 10px between them and it seems to handle better, but not sure what it's supposed to do when dropped
[23:43:12] <bfig> WhirledPress: it's on development... I've been struggling with UI issues, and I can't program the backend :(
