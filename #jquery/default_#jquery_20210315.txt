[12:04:13] <ItsAboutToGoDown> hello, trying to make this feed where only one photo is displayed at a time based on scrolling: https://codepen.io/itsabouttogodown/pen/abBMjGv ... i'm hoping this'd make the feed cleaner, but right now it seems like a nightmare. is there any way to make it usable?
[12:04:42] <ItsAboutToGoDown> (cross-post)
[12:27:22] <robertmaxrees> ItsAboutToGoDown could you be a bit more specific?>
[12:28:48] <ItsAboutToGoDown> robertmaxrees: well right now its super choppy since everything above and below collapses. hoping there's a way to make it smoother, and actually pleasant to browse
[12:29:49] <ItsAboutToGoDown> not sure if such a thing is even possible, have a feeling i *might* be wasting my time. but i want to hide the images to make the feed cleaner
[12:30:05] <ItsAboutToGoDown> at the same time i dont want the user to have to click just to reveal the images. nobody's gonna bother doing that. so idk :/
[12:30:21] <robertmaxrees> well, your scoill handler is doing a LOT.
[12:30:31] <robertmaxrees> why are you trying to hide/show images trhe user can't see?
[12:33:02] <ItsAboutToGoDown> hmm thats a good point.  hehe
[12:33:50] <robertmaxrees> heh
[12:33:54] <ItsAboutToGoDown> i guess i should replace toggleClass with addClass. but as for the scrolling, do you have any ideas?
[12:33:59] <robertmaxrees> erm
[12:34:07] <robertmaxrees> but really, why are you trying to hide/show images the users can't see?
[12:35:31] <ItsAboutToGoDown> :D
[12:35:48] <robertmaxrees> ...
[12:35:50] <ItsAboutToGoDown> seems like that was the major culprit, i removed the hiding and now it seems okay: https://codepen.io/itsabouttogodown/pen/abBMjGv
[12:36:01] <robertmaxrees> what code doesn't make any sense though.
[12:36:03] <ItsAboutToGoDown> just need to animate the photos a little to make it seem smoother?
[12:36:20] <robertmaxrees> i'm being serious, why hide simgething ther user can't see?
[12:36:30] <robertmaxrees> the bigger issue is that the scroll event can fire dozens of times a second.  so $(".post").each(function() { is firing dozens of time a second.
[12:36:47] <ItsAboutToGoDown> hmmm
[12:37:47] <robertmaxrees> and those $(window) calls are also firing a ton.  that's a big issue.
[12:37:48] <ItsAboutToGoDown> well i want to hide all post photos but the first post. basically just for visual reasons - it bothers me having too many things on the same page
[12:38:13] <robertmaxrees> erm
[12:38:18] <robertmaxrees> users are USED to that kind of behavior though.
[12:38:18] <ItsAboutToGoDown> i kinda want it to look like hackernews, but with one photo at a time
[12:38:53] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[12:38:59] <ItsAboutToGoDown> like hackernews.com
[12:39:00] <robertmaxrees> hackernews is just a list of links.
[12:39:01] <ItsAboutToGoDown> its just text
[12:39:12] <ItsAboutToGoDown> yup
[12:39:23] <robertmaxrees> you mean news.ycombinator.com ?
[12:39:27] <ItsAboutToGoDown> i want to maintain that simplicity for my link list
[12:39:30] <ItsAboutToGoDown> haha yeah my bad :D
[12:39:35] <robertmaxrees> uh
[12:39:38] <ItsAboutToGoDown> sorry
[12:39:41] <robertmaxrees> so what does that have to do with images?
[12:39:54] <ItsAboutToGoDown> because i only want one image visible at a time, starting with the first
[12:40:13] <robertmaxrees> hackernews has no images visible ever...
[12:40:16] <ItsAboutToGoDown> and as the user scrolls down, the first gets hidden, the next gets animated in
[12:40:34] <ItsAboutToGoDown> i know that
[12:40:39] <ItsAboutToGoDown> but i want images visible in my thingie
[12:41:34] <robertmaxrees> i'm being 100% honest in that i'm unclear about why you're trying to hide/show iamges that aren't visible to the user.
[12:41:42] <ItsAboutToGoDown> its either gonna be a) like that, 2) crop all images into a rectangle and reveal them in full on click, 3) make a newspaper-style layout instead
[12:41:56] <ItsAboutToGoDown> i understand you
[12:42:02] <ItsAboutToGoDown> but uhm
[12:42:12] <robertmaxrees> why not simplify and just leave the images be?
[12:42:15] <ItsAboutToGoDown> the idea is to get as many text links visible within the same screen real-estate
[12:42:24] <ItsAboutToGoDown> because then the user has to scroll more
[12:42:28] <ItsAboutToGoDown> and not all the images are that interesting
[12:42:44] <robertmaxrees> erm
[12:42:56] <ItsAboutToGoDown> plus a lot of the stuff my users will post is gonna be text only
[12:42:58] <robertmaxrees> hooking into/mucking with browser scroll is a bad idea.
[12:43:12] <ItsAboutToGoDown> so i dont wanna give too much preference/real-estate to posts with images, if that makes sense
[12:43:19] <ItsAboutToGoDown> hmm
[12:43:30] <ItsAboutToGoDown> was afraid you'd say something like that :/
[12:43:51] <robertmaxrees> there's a reason people avoid messing with scrolling.
[12:44:01] <robertmaxrees> and you're running into all of them :)
[12:44:15] <ItsAboutToGoDown> hehe
[12:45:21] <ItsAboutToGoDown> i remember messing with https://github.com/cubiq/iscroll a while back, it got so messed up even the author left the project lol
[12:45:42] <robertmaxrees> yeah, performance and usability for those kinds of projects are hard to get right.
[12:46:10] <ItsAboutToGoDown> appreciate your insights man! time for me to think twice about this
[12:47:07] <ItsAboutToGoDown> working on this thing btw: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aD6JvHKNPPM
[12:47:33] <robertmaxrees> been a while since i've seen a project use RoR :)
[12:48:42] <ItsAboutToGoDown> yeah ror's been subject to a lot of hate crime, just like jquery
[12:50:20] <robertmaxrees> "hate crime" is too extreme.  their community internally being pretty toxic at one point on top of the "magic box" approach are more likely culprits.
[12:51:28] <ItsAboutToGoDown> but its always people who haven't tried it, at least not made anything significant with it, and who've spent their entire lives learning other technologies and who aren't open to change
[12:51:49] <robertmaxrees> no it isn't :)
[12:51:50] <ItsAboutToGoDown> imho ruby is man kind's greatest achievement in programming, and rails is one of the best ways of organizing it
[12:52:01] <ItsAboutToGoDown> you run your own ecommerce store right?
[12:52:08] <robertmaxrees> lmao
[12:52:15] <ItsAboutToGoDown> have you seen www.solidusio.org?
[12:52:16] <robertmaxrees> i don't run it, no.  we have a pretty large team.
[12:52:22] <ItsAboutToGoDown> https://github.com/nebulab/solidus_starter_frontend
[12:52:24] <ItsAboutToGoDown> cool
[12:52:25] <robertmaxrees> i know plenty of people who were in the RoR scene and left for a variety of reasons.
[12:52:37] <robertmaxrees> dns error for that url.
[12:52:37] <ItsAboutToGoDown> true, me too
[12:52:48] <ItsAboutToGoDown> they went to other ruby frameworks like.. phoenix or something?
[12:52:53] <ItsAboutToGoDown> or they created their own
[12:53:19] <robertmaxrees> i'm also not a fan of ruby tbh
[12:53:24] <ItsAboutToGoDown> why?
[12:53:33] <ItsAboutToGoDown> its just like python but simpler and prettier
[12:53:58] <ItsAboutToGoDown> and its so freakin' gorgeous inside html!
[12:54:28] <robertmaxrees> i disagree :) and erm, you don't run "ruby in html".
[12:54:38] <robertmaxrees> but hey, different strokes :)
[14:15:44] <ItsAboutToGoDown> you do run ruby in html its called embedded ruby
[14:17:55] <ItsAboutToGoDown> say if build.com was to convert, and probably only take up 1/10th of the code it currently does
[14:18:02] <ItsAboutToGoDown> this would be its master ruby html file: https://github.com/nebulab/solidus_starter_frontend/blob/master/app/views/spree/layouts/spree_application.html.erb
[14:18:11] <ItsAboutToGoDown> looks pretty good to me!
[14:34:07] <ItsAboutToGoDown> here's my personal one: https://dpaste.org/VxSv
[14:53:33] <robertmaxrees> lool
[14:54:19] <robertmaxrees> *lol - ruby only runs server-side.  and that's a very bold claim :)  you'd be surprised how little code we actually use for our client-facing application :)
