[02:02:53] <axscode> Hi guys, if i have an array (100,200,300,400,500,......., 2000);  what's the best way to find which index in array currently the .scrollTop() value.
[02:03:40] <axscode> I'm not sure what's the best logic calculation / codes for that
[05:34:48] <minikN> Would anyone know how I can get all options of a select that have a value between x and y (1-10)?
[05:34:54] <DarsVaeda> hi, I wonder do I misunderstand documentation on .toggleClass -> I have "class='foo'" and do ".toggleClass('foo bar')", shouldn't that switch back and forth between foo and bar?
[05:36:20] <DarsVaeda> minikN: use .filter() with a filter function maybe
[06:06:06] <minikN> What would a regex for 11-26 be? :o
[06:14:41] <snfgf> in php if i want to check if an index is defined, i will use isset($data['index']) because just using $data['index'] will cause an error; is this similar in JS, or can i check if an index exists (without causing an error) with just data['index']?
[06:17:13] <decx> just just checking is fine
[06:26:16] <sigdk> Is there a guarantee that A will be always printed before B ? function foo() { console.log("A"); functionThatDoesAjax(); }   functionThatDoesAjax() { $.ajax(...).done( console.log("B"); }

[07:53:00] <RenokK> $(<FIELDNAME>).addClass(<INVALID_CLASS>);
[07:53:36] <husker> easy ... thanks i try it out
[08:31:59] <antzero>  Hey! I'm appending contents to the DOM with jquery. How exactly I'm supposed to know when it has finished?
[08:32:08] <antzero>  .append is sync, the DOM update isn't ?
[08:57:47] <Popzi> How do I get the text of a div inside of a div? the name of the div is nameAndDetails.clearfix  and doing  var name = $("div.nameAndDetails.clearfix").text(); doesnt have anything?
[09:00:45] <shoky> Popzi: the name of the div? what do you mean by name
[09:01:35] <Popzi> shoky: the class name sorry
[09:02:37] <shoky> Popzi: $(".nameAndDetails\\.clearfix")
[09:03:01] <shoky> assuming that is one class
[09:03:22] <shoky> though that'd be odd.. are those 2 classes?
[09:04:37] <shoky> wait, you said div inside of a div..?
[09:05:18] <Popzi> hmm nope, shoky, https://jsfiddle.net/craknt4d/ this is kind of the html, but it's all inside of other divs, will that matter? (Fairly new to jquery)
[09:08:18] <Popzi> so more like this https://jsfiddle.net/craknt4d/1/
[09:08:19] <shoky> Popzi: those are 2 classes, not one.  so  $(".nameAndDetails.clearfix")  should select that div fine
[09:08:34] <shoky> Popzi: but.. .text() gets ALL the text inside an element, including text from children elements
[09:09:16] <Popzi> shoky still not logging anything to console, just blank :\ how would we just get the h1?
[09:09:23] <shoky> Popzi:  it logs fine  https://jsfiddle.net/craknt4d/3/
[09:09:45] <shoky> Popzi: you'd select the h1
[09:10:28] <Popzi> shoky hmmm my console log is still empty o_O
[09:10:36] <shoky> Popzi: no, it's not..
[09:10:46] <shoky> Popzi: oh , didn't see "my" heh
[09:10:59] <shoky> Popzi: anyway, it works fine for me ;)
[09:11:19] <Popzi> shoky does it matter than within the html im calling the js file? no?
[09:11:33] <shoky> what
[09:11:33] <shoky> ?
[09:11:36] <Popzi> <script src="file.js">
[09:11:46] <Popzi> and not <script> var console.log...
[09:11:54] <shoky> that's how you include js files..
[09:12:57] <Popzi> shoky so it HAS to be in the html file?
[09:13:04] <shoky> Popzi: no
[09:13:19] <shoky> including external js files is fine
[09:13:25] <shoky> ..every site does it :)
[09:15:27] <Popzi> shoky ah wait, im a nugget. Ok so basically im making a quick chrome exstension, and obvoiusly it's only looking at the html in the exstensions html... the jquery works fine lol, i just need to tell the exstension to read the pages html
[11:10:33] <Es0teric> how do i view all events that are being listened for in the console?
[11:10:37] <Es0teric> so i can bind to one of them

[12:34:59] <robertmaxrees> weeeeeeeeeeeeeee
[13:06:56] <funkt19> https://jsfiddle.net/2onwb6bw/6/ Hi there I am trying to apply the class to only if the number of the var x = 2 and the row only has two columns could anyone help with this?
[13:07:48] <robertmaxrees> so you want to find the 2nd mega-col?
[13:08:15] <funkt19> Yes!
[13:08:27] <funkt19> and mark that with the color red as a border
[13:08:34] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/2onwb6bw/8/
[13:08:44] <robertmaxrees> use EQ.
[13:09:45] <funkt19> oh ok i didnt know about eq
[13:10:04] <funkt19> thank you!
[13:10:16] <robertmaxrees> what you were doing before was grabbing the length of the selector for ALL elements that match that and then seeing if that number equaled 2.
[13:11:04] <funkt19> I know I couldn't quite see how to break it to only select the second row and add a class to that row
[13:11:15] <funkt19> Just trying with your adaption?
[13:11:21] <robertmaxrees> heh because you didn't need to break it.
[13:12:35] <funkt19> Kind of if the row only had 2 cols colur it red and apply the class to the row
[13:12:44] <funkt19> Could I do that with eq?
[13:13:05] <funkt19> or add the class if only has two cols
[13:13:19] <robertmaxrees> did you looka t the fiddle i sent?
[13:13:59] <funkt19> yeahh
[13:14:01] <funkt19> I did
[13:14:10] <robertmaxrees> so what doesn't it do that you need it to do?
[13:14:31] <funkt19> https://jsfiddle.net/2onwb6bw/7/ How would I add the class to the row only if it had 2 columns inside?
[13:15:04] <robertmaxrees> so you want the row that contains 2 columns?
[13:15:09] <funkt19> Yeah!
[13:15:19] <funkt19> Thats it and add a class next to row
[13:15:26] <robertmaxrees> i'd use filter with a function for that.
[13:15:30] <funkt19> Oh..
[13:15:49] <funkt19> Anything simpler?
[13:16:11] <robertmaxrees> that's pretty easy to do.
[13:16:32] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/2onwb6bw/10/
[13:18:23] <funkt19> Nice one ;) cheers saved me a whole lotta time! many thanks!
[13:18:37] <robertmaxrees> sure
[13:24:37] <funkt19> How would I apply a diff class if was 4? with conditional?
[13:24:59] <robertmaxrees> any reason you can't do this server-side?
[13:26:00] <funkt19> Yes..
[13:26:11] <funkt19> Do you think it's possible?
[13:26:15] <robertmaxrees> ? should be pretty trivial server-side.
[13:26:25] <funkt19> I just wanted to count how many are in a row and apply a class
[13:26:28] <robertmaxrees> it's possible to do client-side but this is slowly getting some scope creep.
[13:26:39] <funkt19> Oh see
[13:26:41] <funkt19> too heavy>
[13:26:44] <robertmaxrees> is this happening on pageload?
[13:26:49] <funkt19> yeah
[13:27:01] <robertmaxrees> just do it server-side then.
[13:27:08] <robertmaxrees> the page on initial load should be relatively complete.
[13:27:13] <funkt19> You see im trying to apply this a very specific wp walker
[13:27:34] <funkt19> and it brings very specific parts from diff places
[13:27:35] <robertmaxrees> sounds like you want to extend functionality then.
[13:27:44] <robertmaxrees> i'd really avoid doing this client-side if you can.
[13:27:56] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, you'll wind up with all kinds of convoluted js to handle it.
[13:27:57] <funkt19> Ok so you think i should scrap the client side then
[13:28:04] <funkt19> Ok...
[13:28:11] <funkt19> Thanks for the advice!
[13:31:35] <funkt19> So you think 5 filters functions would be too much?
[13:31:52] <robertmaxrees> you're trying to modify the base page state on pageload.
[13:32:00] <robertmaxrees> which doesn't really make sense.
[13:32:16] <robertmaxrees> why use js to fix it when your backend could just do it right the first time?
[13:32:46] <funkt19> Because the back end does not know how to split the columns up
[13:32:55] <robertmaxrees> then add that functionality :)
[13:33:10] <funkt19> True....
[13:34:02] <funkt19> cheers for the help this may fix a prob for the immediate effect until I can ork out a server side solution
[13:34:14] <robertmaxrees> (shrug)
[13:34:15] <robertmaxrees> good lucl
[13:34:18] <robertmaxrees> *luck
[13:58:48] <NaN> is there a way to use .animate() with transform property?
[13:59:06] <robertmaxrees> why not just use transform??
[13:59:23] <d2k> hello jQuery gods, I have a pretty simple question about error message behavior on a basic form. Why is it showing the error message even when I entered something into the input field? Take a look at this example, please: http://multigraph.com.py/encuentre/index.html
[13:59:56] <robertmaxrees> d2k i'm not seeing any errors there.
[14:00:46] <d2k> robertmaxrees: I see, I wanted to use the browsers (chrome) standard error messages, now I know that I should put real error message handling instead. Thanks a lot!
[14:00:54] <robertmaxrees> wait woah
[14:01:03] <robertmaxrees> you SHOULD use html5 form validation.
[14:01:15] <robertmaxrees> i tested in FF and things were okay.
[14:01:27] <NaN> robertmaxrees: you mean CSS only?
[14:01:36] <robertmaxrees> NaN yes
[14:01:41] <robertmaxrees> d2k chrome works fine, too.
[14:01:48] <robertmaxrees> d2k so what's the actual issue?
[14:02:31] <NaN> robertmaxrees: cause I need to detect when the animation ends
[14:02:43] <robertmaxrees> whyfor?
[14:02:48] <d2k> robertmaxrees: when I enter something into the first input it keeps showing the error message on submit press, and also it's not moving to the second input field error message (could be my browsers cache, I will restart my chrome)
[14:03:06] <robertmaxrees> manually clear your cache
[14:03:22] <d2k> robertmaxrees: Roger that
[14:03:44] <robertmaxrees> NaN fwiw you can detect that using javascript.
[14:04:33] <NaN> robertmaxrees: so .animate() is js; can you elaborate?
[14:04:42] <robertmaxrees> no .animate() at all.
[14:04:45] <robertmaxrees> https://davidwalsh.name/css-animation-callback
[14:05:01] <robertmaxrees> you just use addEventListener and call it a day.
[14:06:00] <NaN> great... thanks robertmaxrees !
[14:06:46] <d2k> robertmaxrees: I still get a strange behavior, I guess I should implement a real form validation. Would have been nice with standard error messages but anyway thanks a bunch!
[14:07:01] <robertmaxrees> you should favor html5 validation.
[14:07:17] <robertmaxrees> and not use JS - mind trying a fiddle?>
[14:07:41] <d2k> robertmaxrees: is html5 validation this similar thing I'm trying to use?
[14:08:04] <d2k> robertmaxrees: Sure I would love to try a fiddle
[14:08:06] <robertmaxrees> it IS what you're trying to use.
[14:10:19] <d2k> robertmaxrees: so in this fiddle I still get the strange behavior: https://jsfiddle.net/   ...did I forgot something?
[14:10:58] <robertmaxrees> need to save first.
[14:11:15] <d2k> robertmaxrees: I enter something into the first input and it still shows the error message for the first input and does not move on to the below input field: https://jsfiddle.net/6L9k2389/
[14:11:49] <d2k> robertmaxrees: Even in the fiddle^^
[14:12:00] <robertmaxrees> where are you seeing these error messages?
[14:12:32] <d2k> robertmaxrees: on the first input, always, no matter if I entered something into the first input or not
[14:12:52] <d2k> robertmaxrees: Does it behave correct on your computer?
[14:12:57] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[14:13:04] <robertmaxrees> rather.
[14:13:10] <robertmaxrees> i'm not getting the issue you're getting.
[14:13:57] <d2k> I will post some screenshots...
[14:14:06] <robertmaxrees> if i leave fields blank it fails.
[14:14:16] <robertmaxrees> what version of chrome are you on?
[14:14:38] <d2k> https://snag.gy/ykVCZd.jpg
[14:15:25] <robertmaxrees> heh
[14:15:29] <robertmaxrees> that's a css issue
[14:15:29] <d2k> robertmaxrees: I thought chrome features auto updates
[14:15:41] <robertmaxrees> it does on restart
[14:15:59] <robertmaxrees> what OS are you on?
[14:16:08] <robertmaxrees> because this smacks of a CSS problem to me.
[14:16:09] <d2k> robertmaxrees: win 8.1 RT
[14:16:30] <robertmaxrees> yeah it's working fine here.  what happens if you fill in all required fields?
[14:16:47] <d2k> robertmaxrees: I will try one moment, please
[14:17:19] <d2k> robertmaxrees: If I fill out all fields it sends the form on submit
[14:17:34] <d2k> robertmaxrees: So I should restart my chrome?
[14:17:43] <robertmaxrees> then there's your answer.
[14:17:49] <robertmaxrees> sounds liek a styling quirk.
[14:18:09] <robertmaxrees> not a validation issue
[14:18:14] <robertmaxrees> i might ask in #css if they have ideas.
[14:19:04] <d2k> robertmaxrees: Those html5 error messages have no CSS assigned, at least not in my code, so you recommend positioning them with CSS?
[14:20:03] <d2k> robertmaxrees: I cannot inspect those error message with code inspector :(
[14:20:22] <d2k> robertmaxrees: So I don't know how they are called
[14:20:35] <robertmaxrees> something tells me it's your page styles.
[14:20:36] <robertmaxrees> one sec.
[14:22:56] <d2k> robertmaxrees: I have a idea, could it be that the oninvalid="this.setCustomValidity('Campo obligatorio')" translation should be a different text?
[14:23:09] <d2k>  robertmaxrees: A different text for each error message?
[14:23:38] <robertmaxrees> doesn't explain why it works for me and not you.
[14:25:12] <robertmaxrees> i'd wonder if this is because you're using position: relative on those inputs.
[14:25:39] <d2k> robertmaxrees: I will put that positioning out and test it
[14:25:50] <robertmaxrees> like, remove your styles entirely.
[14:25:53] <robertmaxrees> and see fi that fixes it.
[14:26:59] <d2k> robertmaxrees: nope, unfortunately not, see: http://multigraph.com.py/encuentre/index.html
[14:27:10] <d2k> robertmaxrees: this is so strange
[14:27:26] <robertmaxrees> that's working fine for me.
[14:27:35] <robertmaxrees> do you have any extensions enabled?
[14:28:17] <d2k> robertmaxrees: It also happens on a co-workers macbook on chrome
[14:28:27] <robertmaxrees> do you both happen to have the same extension installed?
[14:28:33] <robertmaxrees> pretty common scenario.
[14:28:48] <d2k> robertmaxrees: It also happens on my FF developer edition
[14:29:04] <robertmaxrees> i've checked in ff dev and chrome.
[14:29:06] <robertmaxrees> no issues.
[14:29:08] <d2k> robertmaxrees: I have plenty of browsers, I will try with opera and vivaldi now
[14:29:28] <robertmaxrees> i'd ask in #css.  see if they have ideas
[14:31:01] <d2k> robertmaxrees: Maybe it's my computer, I don't restart often. So if you say it works on your computer I must be a strange thing along with my computer because even in Opera I get the same buggy result
[14:31:15] <robertmaxrees> ...
[14:31:22] <d2k> robertmaxrees: Brb :)
[14:31:25] <robertmaxrees> heh, try a restart.  if that doesn't fix it, ask in #css.
[14:31:44] <d2k> robertmaxrees: Thanks man, have a great weekend!!!
[14:41:51] <jtoy> Howdy!
[14:42:03] <jtoy> I have a simple div animation question
[14:42:32] <jtoy> What styles do I need to apply so that... when I give a div a "left: ###px" it will animate to that location
[14:42:39] <jtoy> because these are not them :     -webkit-transition: all 0.5s ease;
[14:42:39] <jtoy>     -moz-transition: all 0.5s ease;
[14:42:39] <jtoy>     -o-transition: all 0.5s ease;
[14:42:39] <jtoy>     transition: all 0.5s ease;
[14:45:38] <d2k_> jtoy: css related question should be ask on the channel #css
[14:48:01] <jtoy> k
[15:02:13] <dedondesta> if ajax query puts html that contain <script> tag into some div, will the code that inside that <script> be executed?
[15:02:55] <robertmaxrees> iirc it messes with them.
[15:03:11] <robertmaxrees> and prevents it.
[15:03:38] <robertmaxrees> and generally you don't want to do that nayway
[15:03:41] <robertmaxrees> *anyway
[15:04:03] <dedondesta> robertmaxrees: thanks
[15:04:23] <d2k_> robertmaxrees: I found something that works, it's oninvalid="this.setCustomValidity(this.willValidate?'':'your custom message')" instead of oninvalid="this.setCustomValidity('Campo obligatorio')"
[15:04:42] <robertmaxrees> that's weird.
[15:05:06] <robertmaxrees> wonder why it worked fine for me and not you.
[15:05:15] <d2k_> robertmaxrees: However it is receiving the language automaticly, which is not bad but oninvalid="" says 'your custom message' and this text wont get displayed. Very strange
[15:05:51] <d2k_> robertmaxrees: The version I had before (with the strange bug) I also tested on my mobile phone, it was the same result as on my computer
[15:06:00] <robertmaxrees> strange
[15:06:50] <d2k_> robertmaxrees: So it's now kinda solved, I just hope nobody will see the output 'your custom message' lol
[15:07:17] <robertmaxrees> should be able to change that text (shrug) but alright.
[15:07:18] <robertmaxrees> funky
[15:07:57] <d2k_> robertmaxrees: ^^ thx a lot for the good guiding, I thought the error sits in front of the screen, e.g. me ;)
[15:08:06] <robertmaxrees> sure
[15:14:25] <d2k_> robertmaxrees: Even if my chrome is set to english the error shows in spanish but when looking it up in FF the error is in english and on mobile it's showing in german (my phones lang). Bad luck friday for me I guess ;)
[15:24:04] <d2k_> FYI: oninvalid="this.setCustomValidity('YOUR LANGUAGE PREFERENCE HERE')" would be nice a proper to change the default error message language but since it could behave very strange (in my cases) oninvalid="" is not necessary at all and in the end it all depends on the users language setting, not on the html's language
[15:29:20] <d2k_> Conclusion: At least I could say "it's not my fault, having a spanish form doesn't mean having spanish error messages by any means. Blame it on multi language people". ;)
[15:36:41] <d2k_> Addition: On another phone that has spanish as the default language the error message shows in english. Wonderfull ;)
[15:37:10] <robertmaxrees> have you hit the MDN documentation for HTML form validation and internationalization?
[15:37:44] <d2k_> robertmaxrees: I will have, thanks for mentioning MDN
[15:37:58] <d2k_> robertmaxrees: I mean ...I will have to^^
[15:39:21] <d2k_> robertmaxrees: If nothing works I will have to use a validation script instead of standard error messages. Let's see what MDN says
[17:31:27] <qakhan> hi all, i am using datatable to show record. i have a circule (icon) in first td of each row. i need to turn green this icon of status is 1. here is my code. https://fiddle.jshell.net/6faumn44/40/
[17:35:18] <qakhan> i am having problem with getting icon html out from datatable so that i can turn icon green if its coresponding number is matching with the status
[17:37:51] <qakhan> currently all only 1st icon is green which status is 0. which should not be green. here is my code https://fiddle.jshell.net/6faumn44/41/
[17:39:01] <robertmaxrees> qakhan #pttrequesttable tr td:eq(0)
[17:39:09] <robertmaxrees> you're selecting the same element every time.
[17:39:40] <robertmaxrees> need to find the one that matches the element you care about.
[17:39:59] <qakhan> robertmaxrees yes you are right.
[17:40:31] <qakhan> but i could not find the way to get .html() and .text() from datatable
[17:40:57] <qakhan> if i can get .html() and .text() from datatable i will get it work
[17:42:16] <cjohnson> I've got some code for html-driven "show if checked" logic. On a node I can do data-show-if-checked="true" data-target="#InputSelector". Right now I'm looking for '[data-show-if-checked]' and for each element, binding the change event to the target selector's element
[17:42:46] <cjohnson> I want to switch to a delegated model so I don't have to re-init each time I add new elements, and also so I can use more complicated selectors
[17:43:12] <cjohnson> Anybody have a better idea than me just binding to $(document).on('change', ':input', ... and filtering out which inputs are targeted by elements on the pages?
[17:43:37] <cjohnson> I would have to scan the whole page each time which sorta defeats the point
[17:43:47] <robertmaxrees> cjohnson are these elements contained in a particular container or something?
[17:44:24] <robertmaxrees> you can also pass any selector as that second arg, so you can use what you were using before.
[17:44:41] <cjohnson> there is no one universal container that contains them no
[17:44:47] <robertmaxrees> gross.
[17:44:51] <cjohnson> well I'm wanting each item to have its own selector
[17:45:01] <cjohnson> haha yeah. this is just a general purpose piece of code that gets used throughout the site
[17:45:11] <robertmaxrees> give 'em a shared class then.
[17:45:11] <cjohnson> to be able to quickly setup conditionally shown form elements
[17:45:28] <cjohnson> the targeted inputs?
[17:45:35] <robertmaxrees> yeah the ones you want to respond to.
[17:45:45] <cjohnson> hrm that's not the worst idea
[17:45:57] <cjohnson> I could give them the class dynamically and then use that class to filter the events
[17:46:02] <robertmaxrees> keeps it simple (shrug)
[17:46:02] <cjohnson> :input.whatever
[17:46:14] <cjohnson> cool I like that more than what I had before, thanks robert
[17:46:18] <robertmaxrees> definitely.
[17:46:23] <robertmaxrees> glad i could help
[17:47:27] <cjohnson> oh one more question
[17:47:55] <cjohnson> I want to be able to trigger the listener using .trigger('change') without necessarily triggering other listeners. is that where namespaces come into play?
[17:48:05] <cjohnson> .on('change.showIfChecked', ...
[17:48:09] <cjohnson> and .trigger('change.showIfChecked')
[17:48:21] <cjohnson> and if so will that still listen for natural change events
[17:48:45] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/on/#event-names
[17:48:50] <robertmaxrees> you can do that.
[17:48:59] <cjohnson> cool
[17:51:10] <qakhan> robertmaxrees any thought on my question
[17:51:45] <robertmaxrees> qakhan datatables is kind of a beast.  i'd hit up their forums, though I feel like they should have something for you in the docs.
[17:53:20] <qakhan> ok
[17:53:24] <qakhan> thanks
[18:13:26] <qakhan> robertmaxrees if i use $('#pttrequesttable tr').each(function(a,b){}) it bing first page records.
[18:13:36] <qakhan> not whole table records
[18:13:47] <robertmaxrees> it's whatever is rendered.
[18:13:57] <robertmaxrees> so if stuff it's in the DOM, it won't be in there.
[18:14:19] <qakhan> but i am using whole table $('#pttrequesttable tr')
[18:14:26] <robertmaxrees> >.>
[18:14:34] <robertmaxrees> jquery can't select stuff that's not in the DOM.
[18:15:12] <qakhan> when page loads all records are in the table
[18:15:42] <robertmaxrees> you're probably selecting the datatables element and not the actual original table.
[18:16:51] <qakhan> $('#pttrequesttable tr') is actual table
[18:17:13] <robertmaxrees> (shrug) just telling you how JQ works.
[18:17:20] <robertmaxrees> if something isn't in the dom, jq can't see it.
[18:17:29] <robertmaxrees> if you have multiple elements with the same ID, that can cause problems, too.
[18:19:30] <qakhan> there is only 1 table with single id https://fiddle.jshell.net/6faumn44/46/
[18:19:33] <d2k_> robertmaxrees: in the end I used https://jqueryvalidation.org which was tiny and cute enough and offers easy access to a lang file. Uhm, this is not ment as an advertisement ;)
[18:20:32] <robertmaxrees> d2k_ that was made by one of the dudes that works on JQ fwiw.
[18:20:37] <robertmaxrees> but glad you figured it out.
[18:20:49] <snover> robertmaxrees: “if something isn't in the dom, jq can't see it.” should i explain this is not correct or are you just simplifying your explanation?
[18:20:58] <robertmaxrees> *sigh*
[18:21:05] <robertmaxrees> simplifying.
[18:21:10] <snover> ok. just checking!
[18:21:10] <robertmaxrees> but go ahead.
[18:21:20] <robertmaxrees> 'cause you looooove correcting me lately :)
[18:21:21] <robertmaxrees> enjoy!
[18:22:22] <snover> all the one other time i’ve done that…
[18:25:17] <qakhan> snover can you please look at my question
[18:26:35] <snover> qakhan: nope. that fiddle doesn’t work and i don’t know anything about the plugin you are using.
[18:28:51] <qakhan> here is my code. i am using datatable . i am trying to get table rows first td .html() and .text()
[18:30:11] <qakhan> currently i can get all records .html() and .text() which are on first page
[18:40:20] <cjohnson> Can I do $(collection).indexOf(nonJqueryNode) to tell if a collection contains a given node?
[18:40:27] <cjohnson> well I guess it's inArray
[18:40:43] <cjohnson> $(collection).inArray(nonJqueryNode)
[18:42:00] <cjohnson> there's contains and has but those seem to be checking if the node is a descendent
[18:45:09] <cjohnson> $(collection).filter(nonJqueryNode).length != 0    I guess
[18:52:24] <cjohnson> oh .is
[18:52:40] <cjohnson> better yet, I can do $(node).is(selector) and I think that means it won't even run the selector against the page
[18:52:45] <cjohnson> just do a match, which is what Iw ant
[19:28:55] <molle_> how to select all elements in another element, for example anchors in list items, in the $() like I would do like this in CSS: li a { } ?
