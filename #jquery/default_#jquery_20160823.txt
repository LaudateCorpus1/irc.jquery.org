[00:04:55] <alturic>  hey guys, if I was ajaxing a response from a php page, is there anyway to actually have the response be a function on the current page? So I'm ajaxing some stuff back, and I'm wondering if the actual response could be "showAlert(response, "success", 15000);"
[00:06:23] <alturic> I tried doing showAlert(response); and then just having the response be printf("Successfull submission!", "success", 15000); but that didn't work as expected. :P
[00:19:37] <TimCoal_> .getscript() alturic
[00:20:28] <TimCoal_> https://api.jquery.com/jquery.getscript/
[00:22:36] <alturic> I don't think I'm looking for that, on an ajax success: I'm looking to run showAlert(message, type, delay). I couldn't just do showAlert(response), and then in the php file that I'm POSTing to do echo 'Successful, success, 3000' as that outputs exactly like so.
[00:23:16] <alturic> So I'm trying to figure out if I could echo 'showAlert(Successfull, success, 3000);';, but that doesn't seem to fire the function correctly either.
[00:24:22] <TimCoal_> you want to fire a function on success or failour?
[00:24:48] <TimCoal_> you can alert out part of the response
[00:27:11] <TimCoal_> http://api.jquery.com/jquery.ajax/
[00:28:55] <TimCoal_>                 success: function(rResponse){}
[00:29:18] <TimCoal_>                 success: function(rResponse){alert(rResponse)}
[00:38:14] <alturic> If I had a json array like response = {"1":"Select a zipcode!","2":"danger"} is there any reason why response[1] logs " to console? :-/
[00:38:54] <alturic> I guess I have to parse it now in js?
[00:41:45] <alturic> Yup, sorry for the stupid questions. :(
[00:42:03] <TimCoal_> no problem
[00:42:54] <TimCoal_> sometimes putting it out there helps us too see our own blindness
[00:43:50] <TimCoal_> thats one of the reasons i like chat, for that very reason
[02:01:00] <Forbidd3n> Hey everyone. In jQuery I have a sticky footer at the bottom - position:aboslute; bottom:0;
[02:01:23] <Forbidd3n> I want to slide the next child up from bottom to top open
[02:01:43] <Forbidd3n> slideUp seems to slide the bottom up and I want to open from the top and expand open
[02:04:52] <Cork> Forbidd3n: i would recommend using css3 and transition the bottom property
[02:05:08] <Cork> (also i would recommend position: fixed instead of absolute)
[02:05:44] <Forbidd3n> Cork: the sticky footer is fixed, the hidden div below is set to absolute so it doesn't hold space
[02:06:16] <Cork> well you can't use any of the slide animations built into jquery
[02:06:21] <Cork> cause those animate the height of the element
[02:06:29] <Cork> you need to animate the top/bottom
[02:07:03] <Forbidd3n> Cork:  I just found this and seems to work
[02:07:03] <Forbidd3n> http://jsfiddle.net/senju/qedz05v4
[02:08:41] <Forbidd3n> that slides up, but the slide down has to have a set negative bottom
[02:08:55] <Forbidd3n> Cork: do you have or know of a sample that shows transitioning os slide
[02:09:19] <Cork> i'm building one right now :)
[02:09:20] <Cork> https://jsfiddle.net/m70w1vzy/2/
[02:09:34] <Cork> if you can't use the side of the window
[02:09:43] <Cork> you need to have a parent with overflow: hidden;
[02:09:57] <Forbidd3n> what do you mean side of window
[02:10:17] <Cork> in this case the footer is pushed outside the window bottom by 100px
[02:10:24] <Cork> and then slided in
[02:10:40] <Cork> if you can't use the side of the window to hide the element
[02:10:45] <Cork> you need a parent with overflow hidden
[02:11:48] <Forbidd3n> Cork: thanks for this - I have a fixed bar at the bottom with a div to follow that is hidden. I want to click the div to open (slide up to top of page) and slide the sibling div with it
[02:12:02] <Forbidd3n> and when clicked again it slides back down to original state
[02:12:11] <Cork> Forbidd3n: so all you need is to replace the setTimeout with a click handler
[02:13:19] <Forbidd3n> let me give it a shot and share the code
[02:18:56] <Forbidd3n> Cork: This is what I have - https://jsfiddle.net/m70w1vzy/4/
[02:19:37] <Cork> Forbidd3n: why not move the entire footer?
[02:19:40] <Cork> why just bar?
[02:20:01] <Forbidd3n> I have to have the content open full height overtop of all content on the page
[02:20:14] <Cork> ya?
[02:20:16] <Cork> one min
[02:21:45] <Forbidd3n> basically I have a footer bar that is fixed, when arrow on the footer bar is clicked the footer moves to top of page and sliding with it is the next() sibling showing the content
[02:22:11] <Cork> Forbidd3n: https://jsfiddle.net/m70w1vzy/6/
[02:22:15] <Cork> why isn't that working?
[02:22:56] <Cork> https://jsfiddle.net/m70w1vzy/8/ <-- removed the unneeded last group
[02:23:10] <Forbidd3n> with that I have to have a fixed negative bottom
[02:23:29] <Cork> you will have to have that either way
[02:23:36] <Cork> one way or another
[02:23:46] <Cork> or... actually
[02:23:50] <Forbidd3n> doesn't that have to change based on height of content
[02:24:00] <Cork> yes it does
[02:24:14] <Cork> but the problem is you can't animate top without it
[02:24:21] <Forbidd3n> ok so there is no other way to do it - you can't set bottom to 0 and slide to top 0
[02:24:30] <Cork> no
[02:24:38] <Cork> but...
[02:24:38] <Forbidd3n> hmmm
[02:24:42] <Cork> one mine let me try something
[02:25:06] <Forbidd3n> sure, thanks for the help btw
[02:28:01] <Forbidd3n> Cork: what about this?
[02:28:01] <Forbidd3n> https://return-true.com/pop-up-footer-the-revival-with-css-transitions/
[02:28:44] <Cork> Forbidd3n: this is the best you can get with dynamic height https://jsfiddle.net/m70w1vzy/9/
[02:28:54] <Forbidd3n> What about that example
[02:29:00] <Cork> Forbidd3n: note that this is a hack and that is why you get a delay before the slide down
[02:29:16] <TimCoal_> i remember many years ago my designers getting excited about the posibilities of html5 and new browsers, its so nice to be 2016 and its all here :D
[02:29:18] <Cork> Forbidd3n: fixed height
[02:29:20] <Forbidd3n> on yours or the one I shared above
[02:29:21] <TimCoal_> the future is cool
[02:30:03] <Cork> Forbidd3n: #footerSlideContent.open { height: 300px; } <-- this is what you don't want
[02:30:34] <Forbidd3n> not possible to set that to 100% so it goes to the top of the page with top set to 0
[02:30:44] <Forbidd3n> Sorry for my stupid questions, just trying to understand is all
[02:30:53] <Cork> doesn't work
[02:31:03] <Cork> the only option is to have js set the height
[02:31:09] <Cork> that is an option though
[02:31:21] <Cork> but css can't animate dynamic height
[02:32:05] <Cork> Forbidd3n: slightly better https://jsfiddle.net/m70w1vzy/10/
[02:33:14] <Forbidd3n> anyway for it to go to the top instead of where it is now
[02:33:30] <Forbidd3n> always vh and vw aren't cross-browser compatible yet are they
[02:33:31] <Cork> "go to the top?
[02:33:39] <Forbidd3n> slide all the way to top
[02:33:41] <Forbidd3n> of page
[02:33:42] <Cork> Forbidd3n: depends on what you require
[02:33:50] <Cork> if you need really old ie, no else yes
[02:34:05] <Cork> Forbidd3n: ah, that makes things a lot easier
[02:34:22] <Forbidd3n> ?
[02:34:26] <Cork> one min
[02:34:57] <Forbidd3n> The transition would be nice but if it just jumps to top and opens content to top I am fine with that as well
[02:36:19] <Cork> Forbidd3n: https://jsfiddle.net/m70w1vzy/11/
[02:36:24] <Cork> is that ok for you?
[02:36:30] <Forbidd3n> checking
[02:36:43] <Cork> Forbidd3n: it can, you just need to animate more elements
[02:37:06] <Cork> but remember you want to avoid animating height, cause css can't do that well (at all actually)
[02:37:15] <Forbidd3n> the top is correct, but it has to be full width and height of page
[02:37:27] <Cork> Forbidd3n: so change the css :)
[02:37:27] <Forbidd3n> it can't be done with jquery?
[02:37:53] <Cork> Forbidd3n: js animation is laggy and cpu heavy
[02:38:04] <Cork> i don't use them unless i absolutely have to
[02:38:17] <Forbidd3n> Cork, so vh anv vw is compatible for all browsers and IE9+
[02:38:32] <Forbidd3n> It appears I have to in this situation. :)
[02:38:57] <Cork> Forbidd3n: http://caniuse.com/viewport-units
[02:39:42] <Cork> also http://caniuse.com/calc
[02:40:40] <Forbidd3n> seems as though IE9 is buggy - client requires IE9+ support. I will write it in jQuery with animation
[02:41:07] <Forbidd3n> unless I am confusing something
[02:41:24] <Cork> Forbidd3n: test and see, as far as i have seen it works just fine
[02:41:39] <Cork> though i don't care too much about ie < 10 now days
[02:41:40] <Forbidd3n> Ok I will do that first
[02:42:06] <Cork> the basics should work in ie9, but i don't care about animations for it
[02:42:09] <Forbidd3n> Cork, me either, but the client specifically stated that - it appears their client uses IE9
[02:42:41] <Cork> does the client know that ie9 means windows xp? or vista without sp?
[02:42:51] <Cork> :/
[02:43:21] <Forbidd3n> Not sure, but it was in the specs
[02:43:24] <Forbidd3n> https://jsfiddle.net/m70w1vzy/13/embedded/result/
[02:43:41] <Forbidd3n> good result I will implement this and if they say anything then I will go from there
[02:47:35] <Forbidd3n> Cork: you there?
[02:47:41] <Cork> yup
[02:49:54] <Forbidd3n> quick question. I have it working first off. Thanks
[02:50:29] <Forbidd3n> secondly. to enable this in touch devices would I use on('touchstart', I can't remember and does it work the same?
[02:51:02] <Cork> Forbidd3n: i would recommend testing on some mobile devices
[02:51:06] <Cork> but click works there too
[02:51:10] <Cork> just not as fast
[02:51:11] <Forbidd3n> ok
[02:51:14] <Forbidd3n> will do
[02:51:24] <Cork> but ya touchstart is a way to make it go faster
[02:53:22] <Forbidd3n> one more quick question
[02:53:40] <Forbidd3n> Any way to make it load 50% up the page on initial load?
[02:54:06] <Forbidd3n> and when they click an arrow I will set cookie and not load on 50% again if cookie exists, but I can do that part
[02:54:10] <Cork> sure
[02:54:30] <Cork> just add a class
[02:54:40] <Cork> and in js check for the cookie, and if it exist remove the class
[02:54:54] <Cork> (or better is prob to check for the cookie and add the class if it isn't there)
[02:54:59] <Forbidd3n> I would change this to .half { top: calc(100vh - 60px); }
[02:55:03] <Forbidd3n> to 50vh
[02:55:11] <Cork> yup
[02:55:17] <Forbidd3n> :)
[02:55:31] <Cork> calc makes css nice :)
[02:55:44] <Cork> btw you might just want to use 50vh instead
[02:55:52] <Cork> else you will go 60px above center
[02:56:13] <Forbidd3n> just in the half way up one correct?
[02:56:21] <Cork> correct
[02:56:30] <Cork> well actually
[02:56:33] <Forbidd3n> top: 50vh;
[02:56:36] <Forbidd3n> so that
[02:56:40] <Cork> only in the "hidden" state do you want the -60px
[02:57:03] <Forbidd3n> correct so I would not set the -60px
[02:57:09] <Cork> yup
[03:17:11] <Forbidd3n> Cork: thanks again! I have it all working. I will fire up the windows machine in the morning and check it in IE9+
[03:17:37] <Forbidd3n> You said it should all work? If not the transition for older IE, but it will still open, correct?
[03:17:58] <Cork> Forbidd3n: ie9 yes, not older
[03:18:08] <Cork> ie8 doesn't support vh and vw
[03:18:09] <Forbidd3n> ok that is all that matters!:)
[03:18:18] <Forbidd3n> Thanks!! for the help
[03:18:22] <Cork> np
[03:18:46] <Forbidd3n> The good thing is I went through it modified it to my liking and understand what is going on :)
[03:19:01] <Cork> nice!
[03:19:15] <Cork> also as you hopefully realized, css3 animations is quite simple
[03:19:40] <Cork> Forbidd3n: also if you get problem with ie9 you can add a script that only runs on ie9 and that emulates the css3
[03:19:56] <Cork> it is prob how i would solve it if it broke there for some reason
[03:20:02] <Forbidd3n> Are you here usually?
[03:20:10] <Cork> work days ya
[03:20:40] <Forbidd3n> I will test tomorrow and reach out if not if you have the time to help then cool if not I can wait until you do if I can't implement what you are suggesting
[03:21:05] <Cork> Forbidd3n: it's quite simple
[03:21:22] <Cork> just check if the transition property exists on the element
[03:21:29] <Cork> if it doesn't then it means the browser doesn't support it
[03:21:33] <Forbidd3n> for some people - I understand if if less than IE
[03:21:34] <Cork> and do the legacy solution
[03:21:46] <Forbidd3n> that is the issue the legacy solution :)
[03:21:50] <Cork> Forbidd3n: i wouldn't recommend using ua sniffing
[03:22:12] <obert> hello, is there a sort of .lightbox() built in in jquery?
[03:22:30] <Cork> Forbidd3n: you would have to do quite a few things, like grabbing the height of the window on window resize
[03:22:53] <Cork> Forbidd3n: and on click animate the top value from <fetched on resize> to 0 and back
[03:23:09] <Cork> (and yes it is ugly, but it is legacy so what do you expect)
[03:23:16] <Forbidd3n> agree
[03:23:48] <Forbidd3n> I will attempt it tomorrow, but I may reach out for help if you have the time to work with me on it :) I really appreciate you taking the time tonight to help me.
[03:26:37] <Cork> np
[03:34:28] <chipyy> Goodmorning
[03:57:50] <chipyy> in my input if i write DROP and put space behind word drop it wont count me as banned word
[03:58:07] <chipyy> how could i fix that,and had set to split input by ' '
[03:59:34] <Cork> chipyy: you're missing too much context
[03:59:42] <Cork> simplest is prob if you make a jsfiddle.net
[04:01:09] <TimCoal_> is there any way to see the code of a function ... console.log (showCode(xyzfunction));?
[04:01:41] <Cork> TimCoal_: console.log(showCode.toSource()) or console.log(showCode.toString()) depending on browser
[04:01:58] <chipyy> sorry again my mistake i dont have even this in my function :) its outside...
[04:02:20] <Cork> chipyy: you haven't shared enough info to help you, sorry
[04:02:21] <TimCoal_> thanks you, didn't figure it would be so simple
[04:04:36] <TimCoal_> chippy can you show an example in http://jsfiddle.net
[04:05:45] <chipyy> atm i dont need help i fixed it , it wasnt in my function
[04:06:42] <chipyy> its working now
[04:07:44] <chipyy> and one more question, if user writes inputs : DroP or Or DrOp <- this commands will be still recognized by SQL right?
[04:08:21] <Cork> chipyy: ... are you accepting sql strings from the web and running them on your sql server???
[04:08:23] <chipyy> so i should all inputs first convert to lowercase and check it for this words
[04:08:36] <Cork> if you are that is a HORRIBLY bad idea
[04:08:40] <chipyy> i want to prevent sql injections
[04:08:51] <Cork> this isn't the way
[04:08:59] <Cork> banning words won't protect you
[04:09:10] <chipyy> i know but its first line of defence :D
[04:09:19] <Woet> chipyy: wtf? who told you that was a good idea?
[04:09:24] <Woet> chipyy: what language are you using?
[04:09:25] <Cork> no it is more like a plaster to hide a broken bone
[04:09:39] <chipyy> jquery ,ajax and php
[04:09:50] <Woet> chipyy: okay, so use PHP with PDO and prepared statements
[04:09:53] <Woet> entirely fixed
[04:09:55] <chipyy> i will prevent on both sides
[04:10:00] <Woet> chipyy: wat?
[04:10:08] <Woet> chipyy: you don't "prevent" mysql injection on the mysql side.
[04:10:15] <Woet> chipyy: http://hastebin.com/ayituwapey.coffee
[04:10:32] <Woet> or on the jquery side (aka client side)
[04:11:12] <chipyy> so what is your advice that should i only check on php side for sql injection? not on jquery?
[04:11:45] <Cork> chipyy: firstly, jquery should never EVER have access to sql queries at all
[04:11:53] <Cork> in any form or shape
[04:12:12] <Cork> instead it might provide data that you sanitize in php and use in sql queries
[04:12:15] <chipyy> with jquery i check inputs and if its ok i send with ajax to php
[04:12:35] <Woet> chipyy: you realize jquery is client side right?
[04:12:38] <Woet> i can make your script do whatever i want
[04:12:44] <chipyy> yes i know that
[04:12:46] <Woet> okay
[04:12:47] <Woet> so dont use it
[04:12:52] <Woet> not even has a "first line of defense"
[04:13:04] <Woet> its a waste of time and a waste of my CPU cycles
[04:13:14] <chipyy> hehe
[04:13:15] <Woet> use PDO with PHP like I linked you an example of
[04:13:15] <Cork> and it is insecure
[04:13:16] <Woet> that's all you have to do.
[04:13:24] <Cork> cause if you expose sql queries to js
[04:13:28] <Cork> you are bound to get injections
[04:13:32] <Cork> one way or anorher
[04:13:42] <Woet> Cork: i think he's cleaning the values like "first name" and stuff like that
[04:13:44] <Cork> there isn't a safe way for you to protect your self
[04:13:48] <Woet> so your name cant contain "drop"
[04:14:05] <Woet> chipyy: http://php.net/manual/en/pdo.prepared-statements.php
[04:14:08] <Cork> that is utterly pointless if that is the case
[04:14:10] <chipyy> yes exactly
[04:14:11] <Woet> it is
[04:14:24] <Woet> it only causes issues
[04:16:25] <chipyy> i will paste you code so u will see what i am up to
[04:17:27] <chipyy> here is script code: http://pastebin.com/5S338CDW
[04:20:37] <Cork> chipyy: there are no need for that code at all
[04:20:44] <Cork> just remove the list of banned words
[04:22:19] <chipyy> ok, please explain me like you would explain a noob why isnt that good idea? why isnt this good prevention?
[04:23:28] <Cork> chipyy: cause it prevents the user from using names that shouldn't have any problem what so ever for you unless you are doing the rest of you're code unsafe
[04:23:52] <Cork> just never trust user input and this shouldn't be a problem
[04:24:07] <Cork> you can't trust user input anyway, as you can't trust js
[04:24:14] <Cork> so this entire section of code is pointless
[04:24:23] <chipyy> ok.
[04:24:23] <Cork> (except it will cause questions from users)
[04:25:29] <chipyy> but what about if somebody will like to create account with username "fuck" ? :D
[04:25:53] <Cork> chipyy: do you really care?
[04:26:46] <chipyy> yes and no :D
[04:26:49] <Cork> if you really do, then sure have a banned words for that, but not sql questions
[04:26:59] <Cork> *queries
[04:27:20] <Cork> cause that just makes ppl that know how sql injections work nervy
[04:27:21] <chipyy> in sql i am just checking username and password with sql queries nothing else
[04:27:32] <Cork> doesn't matter
[04:27:51] <Cork> if you aren't sanitizing the data correctly it can be an sql injection anyway
[04:28:07] <chipyy> ok
[04:28:46] <chipyy> and sanitazing could be done with pdo php or something like that?
[04:28:50] <Cork> ex SELECT 1 from users WHERE namme = "<user>" AND passoword = "<password>"
[04:29:09] <Cork> and password can just be '"; drop users;"'
[04:29:16] <Cork> and you will lose your table
[04:29:18] <chipyy> i know that
[04:29:20] <Cork> or worse dump it
[04:29:27] <chipyy> and because of that i am using banned words :)
[04:29:36] <Cork> and yes sanitize should happen in server side not client side
[04:29:45] <Cork> chipyy: ban words isn't sanitizing
[04:29:52] <chipyy> ok
[04:30:03] <Cork> cause banned words just means they have to be more constructive to create the sql statement
[04:30:17] <Cork> like creating sql functions that build the word "drop"
[04:30:21] <Cork> do don't do it
[04:30:25] <Cork> so*
[04:30:29] <chipyy> ok
[04:30:41] <Cork> handle user input data as if it was nitroglycerin
[04:30:57] <Cork> that is the only safe way to do it
[04:31:03] <chipyy> i understand that in some way, but i just want to know how the hell isnt that safe on client side,
[04:31:12] <chipyy> not that he can just add some new words
[04:31:18] <Cork> chipyy: it isn't that it isn't safe
[04:31:27] <Cork> it is that it is absolutely pointless
[04:31:37] <chipyy> ok XD
[04:31:40] <Cork> it is security theater
[04:32:04] <Cork> it adds zero security but makes developers think "oh i don't need to check x, cause the data is safe"
[04:32:07] <Cork> and that is BAD
[04:32:45] <chipyy> so i should use this: http://php.net/manual/en/pdo.prepared-statements.php
[04:32:56] <chipyy> so i dont need to check it on client side
[04:33:27] <Cork> yes
[04:33:39] <chipyy> ok
[04:33:44] <Cork> specifically the end of the second bullet point is what you care about
[04:33:55] <Cork> "the developer can be sure that no SQL injection will occur (however, if other portions of the query are being built up with unescaped input, SQL injection is still possible)."
[04:34:38] <Cork> so only use user inputs in buildParam and not in the prepare statement, and you should be ok
[04:35:21] <chipyy> so i am doing it ok? because i dont understand you sentence 100%
[04:36:14] <Cork> chipyy: as long as you don't do prepare('<some string>' . $POST[]) or anything even remotely similar
[04:36:17] <Cork> then ya, you are ok
[04:36:46] <Cork> basically if possible you want the prepare statement to be static strings
[04:37:45] <chipyy> you mean that for client side not for server side (Php)
[04:38:14] <chipyy> i think that i am ok with this
[04:39:30] <Cork> chipyy: no i mean that for server side
[04:39:46] <Cork> client side can do what ever you like as far as security concerns
[04:39:57] <Cork> you can't ever build security on that side
[04:40:15] <Cork> (you can hide security effects, but not build security)
[04:40:50] <chipyy> ok
[04:42:52] <TimCoal_> anyone know where i jsfiddle i can set breakpoints in the browser
[04:43:18] <Cork> TimCoal_: as it runs in iframes it is a bit complicated
[04:43:32] <TimCoal_> ... for the code being fiddled
[04:43:44] <Cork> ya, i meant for that code
[04:43:56] <Cork> there isn't really a straight forward way to do that
[04:44:03] <Cork> you could try adding a debugger; line
[04:44:06] <Cork> the browser might catch that
[04:44:58] <TimCoal_> i'll give that a go
[04:45:10] <chipyy> if i want to create a div for messages, which will appear on different statuses,, should i alway clean div after its over messages, so the new message could appear instead of him?
[04:48:00] <TimCoal_> no that wasnt very productive.  no matter, its time this was a function not a fiddle
[04:48:23] <TimCoal_> more tea!
[04:54:03] <chipyy> i got it, i wrote after delay(6000) to set div text on "", but it doesnt work after delay it sets immeadiatly to "", how can i fix it?
[05:35:27] <chipyy> how could i check if my site is connected to database?
[05:35:58] <chipyy> in browser not in my code, because something doesnt work and i didnt change anything...
[05:42:53] <Cork> chipyy: you can't cause the browser doesn't have access to the database
[05:47:23] <chipyy> ok..
[05:47:56] <chipyy> on my site i have google maps which reads markers from my database and shows it on map
[05:48:10] <chipyy> and today doesnt work and i dont have any clue why not
[05:48:17] <chipyy> yesterday was still working
[05:48:34] <chipyy> its working in combination with xml and php
[05:49:18] <chipyy> cork:^
[06:34:50] <jak2000> hi all
[06:35:10] <jak2000> is possible: hidden a option in a (select Option)?
[06:47:44] <Cork> jak2000: in firefox, not in webkit or ie; aka: no
[06:56:54] <TimCoal_> why do you wany a hidden option? @ jak2000
[07:13:36] <jak2000> Cork, TimCoal_ done: $("#xTipoEntrega option[value=5]").show();   or $("#xTipoEntrega option[value=5]").hide();  worked on Chrome
[07:14:10] <jak2000> is similar options for a sale or buy
[07:14:12] <jak2000> thanks
[07:25:54] <Cork> jak2000: last i checked that leaves an empty space in some browsers and does nothing in others
[07:26:23] <Cork> so i wouldn't recommend using it as it isn't cross browser
[07:31:45] <jak2000> for my clients i recommend use chrome
[07:32:29] <Cork> jak2000: doesn't mean you should use a solution that only works there
[07:32:48] <jak2000> yes i know but for moment, while i get a real solution
[07:32:50] <Cork> (it is a solution that hurts the open web)
[07:33:55] <jak2000> other thing: in a text area how to do: the user type  characters, when length of the line == 10 add a Enter, how to do this?
[07:45:34] <jak2000> Cork: http://fiddle.jshell.net/jamiguel77/dtxtedLn/1/
[07:45:49] <jak2000> how to get the line number? and if length =10 add a return?
[07:49:16] <jak2000> arghh cant
[07:49:24] <jak2000> http://fiddle.jshell.net/jamiguel77/dtxtedLn/2/
[08:05:39] <jak2000> http://fiddle.jshell.net/xxovrqut/  solved thanks to listie@freenode.programming
[08:12:37] <KnightsOfNi> if you have 2 click handlers for 1 element, Are they executed simultaneously or in order of apperance in the cod?
[08:14:56] <shoky> in the order they were added
[08:15:46] <shoky> js code never runs simultaneously, except if using web workers or someth
[08:16:25] <KnightsOfNi> ok
[08:25:26] <momomo> calling elements.left.is(":visible"); .... without actually doing anything else is causing some rendering issues .. this is wierd
[08:25:46] <momomo> can this be expected?
[08:29:15] <shoky> momomo: it can cause a re-render, yes, which maybe can cause issues in certain scenarios
[08:29:33] <shoky> momomo: the docs for :visible even have a note:  Using this selector heavily can have performance implications, as it may force the browser to re-render the page before it can determine visibility. Tracking the visibility of elements via other methods, using a class for example, can provide better performance.
[08:29:36] <momomo> do you have any reference to that info .. i couldn't find such info online
[08:29:50] <shoky> http://api.jquery.com/visible-selector/
[08:30:34] <momomo> shoky, yes, thanks .. i guess i had to figure it out in a differnt way
[08:31:10] <shoky> ya, not recommended to use :visible
[08:37:20] <momomo> for me it's not about performance
[08:37:27] <momomo> calling it on one element is hardly an issue
[08:38:00] <momomo> the re-rendering and potential destruction of rendering is a bigger one
[08:38:07] <momomo> and that one should be mentioned
[08:38:17] <momomo> it only mentions problems due to performance
[08:38:42] <momomo> css('display') != null
[08:38:51] <momomo> != 'none' works for me though
[08:48:30] <shoky> best to just use a class
[09:05:36] <Duikb00t> Hmm not realted to jquery immediatly but are there some Bootstrap pro's here? :D
[09:06:20] <Cork> => ##thitter-bootstrap
[09:09:07] <momomo> shoky, fcuk .. i think css('display') doing the sme
[09:09:25] <Cork> momomo: like he said, use a class
[09:09:34] <Cork> it is for many reasons the better options
[09:09:44] <Cork> i would actually recommend NOT using .hide/.show at all
[09:10:47] <momomo> Cork, yes, I normally do that .. add and rmeove a hide claass
[09:11:04] <Cork> then why don't you this time?
[09:12:28] <momomo> Cork, i was enabling disabling somethng from css and run into this issue .. there is also the possiblity of animating something to disappear then adding a class is not possible .. is visible is the ideal soluition .. but has issue
[09:12:29] <momomo> s
[09:12:49] <Cork> momomo: sure it is, just use transition
[09:13:48] <Cork> the one exception is that you can't animate height
[09:14:22] <Cork> or more specifically you can't animate height: auto
[09:41:26] <Duikb00t> Hmm based on this: https://api.jquery.com/hasclass/
[09:41:58] <Duikb00t> can I do $( ".bar" ).hasClass( "foo" )
[09:42:07] <Cork> yes
[09:43:05] <Duikb00t> party
[09:47:47] <Duikb00t> When I try to detect a click  on a accordeon on what element should I bind the change event?
[09:48:12] <Duikb00t> https://jsfiddle.net/mum6nquh/2/   I would like to detected the state  to show/hide the div and append it to it
[09:48:30] <Duikb00t> Mind the '.' that I forgot
[09:52:36] <Duikb00t> Some other one I've tried, I want to detect when it's collapsed and when it's not https://jsfiddle.net/mum6nquh/4/
[09:53:20] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/mum6nquh/5/
[09:53:45] <Duikb00t> >< :D
[09:54:08] <Duikb00t> Should those change event's always be set on A elements?
[09:54:18] <taplar> *shrug*
[09:54:56] <taplar> bootstrap may have some callbacks you can use
[09:55:22] <Duikb00t> oh :D
[09:56:39] <Duikb00t> thx taplar
[10:05:52] <Duikb00t> pfff this shit is crazy
[10:05:53] <Duikb00t> :D
[10:06:02] <Duikb00t> I want to add another fluid-container with a container with an image
[10:06:37] <Duikb00t> when a accordeon item is open below the content of the accordion

[10:53:07] <BlackEagle> Hey everyone, I´m new to this IRC in search of a solution for what I´m trying to archieve. Is anyone here with a bit of spare time at the moment?
[10:54:04] <shoky> ask your question, if someone wants to answer they will
[10:55:21] <BlackEagle> Well, by explaining it a huge lot I found simply showing the project & screenshot is often the best to explain what I´d like to implement so Here´s the project: http://mctcp.craftrealms.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/mainpage-1.svg and here´s what im trying to archieve: http://mctcp.craftrealms.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Naamloos-1.png
[10:56:00] <BlackEagle> The project is a .svg image with onclick embedded
[10:56:52] <BlackEagle> If nobody wants to help me here at the moment but do know a place where they might please refer me, I dont have any problems with it as this is my last resort. I dont have the luxury to complain
[11:04:32] <wild_oscar> hi. I'm trying to debug a code, could you please help? in:                 if ($.cookie) {
[11:04:32] <wild_oscar>                     $.cookie('sidebar_closed', '0');
[11:04:32] <wild_oscar>                 }
[11:04:44] <wild_oscar> what does the first "if $.cookie" do ?
[11:06:53] <slax0r> ensures that $.cookie is not falsy
[11:07:26] <wild_oscar> so ensures that the function exists?
[11:12:23] <taplar> ya
[11:14:19] <wild_oscar> this is 3rd party code. if I'm using an older version of this cookie plugin: https://github.com/js-cookie/js-cookie/blob/master/src/js.cookie.js , if($.cookie) will return true when the plugin is loaded
[11:14:46] <wild_oscar> however, if($.Cookies) doesn't work on https://github.com/carhartl/jquery-cookie/blob/master/src/jquery.cookie.js
[11:14:54] <wild_oscar> links are swapped, sorry
[11:15:21] <wild_oscar>  if($.cookie) will return true when the plugin is loaded: https://github.com/carhartl/jquery-cookie/blob/master/src
[11:15:38] <wild_oscar> but, if($.Cookies) doesn't work on: https://github.com/js-cookie/js-cookie/blob/master/src/js.cookie.js
[11:16:17] <taplar> cause it's attached to the window, not the $
[11:16:26] <taplar> it's just Cookies, not $.Cookies
[11:18:58] <BlackEagle> Can anyone refer me to the proper place which explains me how to use jquery with .svg files?
[11:19:59] <taplar> *jquery's really a dom abstraction library - you could check out something like http://keith-wood.name/svg.html to help fill in those galps.
[11:20:03] <taplar> from robert yesterday
[11:20:04] <shoky> BlackEagle: i doubt there is such a place. jquery doesn't really support svg (and definitely doesnt do anything for .svg files)
[11:21:26] <BlackEagle> shoky, what would you suggest instead of svg? clip-path: polygon maybe?
[11:21:49] <shoky> don't have a suggestion on the matter, sorry ;p
[11:22:25] <shoky> also.. just because jquery doesn't support something doesn't mean you shouldn't use it :)
[11:23:29] <BlackEagle> I´ve been searching around the net since last week, I´m also new to all this so I´m struggeling with something that I think should be easy
[11:23:50] <taplar> :/ did you see the link i shared?
[11:24:02] <shoky> BlackEagle what you showed doesn't look easy at all, fwiw :)
[11:24:11] <BlackEagle> anyway, I´ll be checking into the page taplar suggested once more in that case.. And ye haha I´ve already read that one last week but I´ll try once more
[11:24:12] <shoky> (and i'm not new to all this)
[11:24:52] <BlackEagle> shoky, you´ll be supriced how many people told me all the diffrent ways and that the stuff I do is all basic haha
[11:26:05] <shoky> if they said it about that svg stuff you posted before, i'd indeed be surprised ;)
[11:26:49] <BlackEagle> I was glad that I managed to get the onclick workingg but was utterly dissapointed when I tried the same with onmouseover
[11:31:15] <wild_oscar> taplar: thanks!
[11:31:21] <BlackEagle> Ohhh found a nice example on the page you referred taplar, thanks :D
[11:32:34] <wild_oscar> taplar: incidentally, where did you see the difference in both scripts?
[11:33:05] <wild_oscar> foundit, window.Cookies
[11:35:50] <taplar> on the main page of that github
[11:35:59] <taplar> they show various examples
[12:25:17] <YokoBR> hi folks
[12:25:22] <robertmaxrees> good morning.
[12:26:04] <YokoBR> i'm trying to add/remove fields dinamically on a form. I mean, i have a "number" input, that i wish to add more numbers. But jquery .remove() doesn't seem to work
[12:26:16] <robertmaxrees> mind showing up?
[12:27:28] <robertmaxrees> *us
[12:27:40] <YokoBR> off course, just a sec
[12:33:45] <YokoBR> https://jsfiddle.net/rb965yfs/3/
[12:34:10] <robertmaxrees> any reason you're not using .on() for your event bindings?
[12:35:33] <robertmaxrees> and take a look at your console.
[12:35:35] <robertmaxrees> you have an error.
[12:36:13] <robertmaxrees> var i = $('#p_scents p').size() + 1; - there's no .size() method. areoyu looking for the total number of $('#p_scents p')?
[12:36:56] <robertmaxrees> also also: don't do another click event listener inside your current one.
[12:37:18] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/rb965yfs/8/
[12:37:53] <YokoBR> robertmaxrees: nice, but remove still doesn't work
[12:38:01] <robertmaxrees> right.
[12:38:12] <YokoBR> it was already adding before, when i was using ".click(function
[12:38:14] <robertmaxrees> look at what i told you and then look at your code.
[12:38:25] <robertmaxrees> you had .click() inside of another click handler.
[12:38:28] <robertmaxrees> that's not a good thing to do.
[12:39:15] <taplar> side note, your duplicating ids not only for each click, but within the elements of each click
[12:39:23] <robertmaxrees> was also about to say that.
[12:39:49] <robertmaxrees> so basically, don't repeat IDs, use .on(), and .size() doesn't exist.
[12:42:40] <YokoBR> https://jsfiddle.net/rb965yfs/11/
[12:43:02] <robertmaxrees> you'll want toi use a delegated event listener for that remove.
[12:43:21] <robertmaxrees> also: var i = $('#p_scents p').size() + 1;
[12:43:26] <robertmaxrees> not a thing - .size() doesn't exist.
[12:43:40] <taplar> id="p_scnt_' + i + '" <-- why not use a class instead?
[12:44:15] <robertmaxrees> for the freebie: https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/rb965yfs/17/
[12:45:50] <YokoBR> thanks robertmaxrees !
[12:46:03] <robertmaxrees> you should read http://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/
[12:46:09] <taplar> hmm, would it be better to append the html to the scentDiv instead of wrapping it?
[12:46:17] <robertmaxrees> ^
[12:46:19] <taplar> and you still have one id that will be duplicated in the markup
[12:46:25] <robertmaxrees> there are lots of other fixes to make here.
[12:47:41] <robertmaxrees> YokoBR so don't ship this code as-is.
[12:48:06] <taplar> also note 'removeScent' is more readable than 'remSnt'
[12:48:06] <YokoBR> sure
[12:48:19] <YokoBR> i'm already fixing it, thanks for the tips
[12:48:28] <robertmaxrees> why do people shorten var and classnames and stuff like that?
[12:48:35] <taplar> really no reason to abbreviate ids/classes if it desegregates readability
[12:48:45] <taplar> and that auto correct was weird
[12:48:54] <robertmaxrees> i was about to say...
[12:48:55] <robertmaxrees> hahahaha
[12:49:03] <taplar> degredate(sp)
[12:49:25] <robertmaxrees> degrade
[12:49:36] <taplar> works for me, heh
[12:49:45] <robertmaxrees> i was an english nerd in a past life
[12:49:59] <taplar> isn't there one like deg-ra-date ?
[12:50:12] <robertmaxrees> degredation
[12:50:18] <taplar> ah
[12:54:07] <taplar> maybe it's a lingering habit back from C and the naming pattern like strFirstName.  though maybe they're trying to save memory or type less, *shrug*
[12:54:24] <taplar> probably predates C
[12:55:44] <robertmaxrees> assembly folks do that, too.
[12:57:02] <taplar> heh, i've forgotten all of my assembly class.  other than 13, 10
[12:58:45] <taplar> oh, and that it was better to do x = x - x instead of x = 0
[13:02:45] <JZA> hi anyone around?
[13:02:50] <taplar> yup
[13:02:52] <JZA> I want to know how to get an SVG cloned.
[13:03:01] <taplar> against the law bro
[13:03:11] <taplar> unethical
[13:03:14] <JZA> I have this page where I want to clone it as a matrix.
[13:03:15] <robertmaxrees> http://stackoverflow.com/a/23093725
[13:03:26] <JZA> http://alexandro.biz/assets/bar2.html
[13:03:32] <JZA> taplar: huh?
[13:03:38] <robertmaxrees> he's joking.
[13:03:41] <robertmaxrees> look at the SO anser.
[13:03:42] <taplar> poorly
[13:03:45] <robertmaxrees> *answer
[13:04:13] <taplar> lot of svg questions lately
[13:04:23] <JZA> well I already have the grid, I just need to 'enclose' the SVG into a variable that I can add the clone() method.
[13:04:35] <robertmaxrees> JZA jquery doens't do SVG.
[13:04:49] <robertmaxrees> so you'll want to use native javascript.
[13:04:49] <JZA> I am already doing it.
[13:04:50] <JZA> I just need to clone it.
[13:04:59] <robertmaxrees> *sigh*
[13:05:26] <JZA> $.get("img/seat.svg", function(data) { ...
[13:05:47] <robertmaxrees> then it'd be $(data).clone()
[13:05:50] <JZA> then I just insert it with innerHTML like: room.innerHTML = new XMLSerializer().serializeToString(data.documentElement);
[13:06:14] <JZA> and insert it back to the DIV tag:  document.body.insertBefore(room, document.body.childNodes[0]);
[13:07:06] <JZA> but now, I need to insert it in a for and do a for (...) {  myseat.clone().appendTo('#tag'); }
[13:07:27] <robertmaxrees> what are you enumerating over?
[13:07:38] <JZA> I have a row and column variables.
[13:07:48] <JZA> then reference them in the for
[13:08:00] <JZA> for (i = 0; i < numColumns; i++) { ...
[13:08:00] <robertmaxrees> something here seems funky, but 'kay.
[13:08:16] <robertmaxrees> either way, you'd just need to pass the object to $()
[13:08:22] <robertmaxrees> i can't guarantee that'll work well though.
[13:08:45] <JZA> well I kinda already do it, but this was just cloning an <img src="../file.svg" >
[13:08:50] <robertmaxrees> right.
[13:08:59] <robertmaxrees> because jquery doesn't speak SVG :)
[13:09:49] <neilpdx> are you sure that is the right MIME type for SVG files?
[13:10:03] <JZA> well is working
[13:10:14] <JZA> http://alexandro.biz/assets/bar2.html
[13:10:28] <JZA> I just need to loop it
[13:10:54] <JZA> https://jsfiddle.net/qns8gcpm/6/
[13:11:03] <robertmaxrees> $.get() doesn't return a jquery object btw.
[13:11:18] <robertmaxrees> anything you need to do with that ajax return needs tobe in that callback.
[13:11:19] <JZA> no it returns the whole SVG code
[13:11:22] <JZA> thats what I NEED to do.
[13:11:32] <robertmaxrees> open your console.
[13:11:34] <robertmaxrees> see that error?
[13:11:51] <robertmaxrees> https://api.jquery.com/jquery.get/ -> Returns: jqXHR
[13:11:55] <JZA> well duh, yeah I've been trying to clone it.
[13:11:59] <robertmaxrees> >.>
[13:12:03] <robertmaxrees> you cannot clone the get call.
[13:12:08] <robertmaxrees> you're getting a deferred there.
[13:12:09] <JZA> uselessly
[13:12:11] <robertmaxrees> not a jquery object.
[13:12:28] <robertmaxrees> anything you need to do with the return of the get call needs to happen inside the callback.
[13:14:07] <JZA> well I tried putting the whole thing inside the for loop but still didnt work.
[13:14:19] <robertmaxrees> show me what you mean by that.
[13:14:39] <robertmaxrees> because it sounds like you're confused about how async code works.
[13:15:15] <JZA> just instead of adding the clone to the seatvar, I just generate the SVG withing the loop
[13:15:28] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[13:16:18] <JZA> for (i = 0; i < numColumns; i++) { $.get("img/seat.svg", function(data) { ...
[13:16:27] <robertmaxrees> still not making sense haha
[13:16:31] <taplar> oh no
[13:16:31] <robertmaxrees> just update the fiddle, yo.
[13:16:39] <taplar> that's multiple get requests
[13:16:41] <robertmaxrees> ^
[13:16:55] <robertmaxrees> you're basically confused about what $.get() does and how it works.
[13:17:36] <robertmaxrees> that first call *should* get cached, but I'd call it and save the deferred to a var and then just .then() whatever you're looking for.
[13:18:58] <JZA> ok where should I save the var, in the function?
[13:19:02] <robertmaxrees> no.
[13:19:11] <robertmaxrees> var myGetCall = $.get();
[13:19:24] <robertmaxrees> ditch the callback for the .get()
[13:19:34] <JZA> umm... I thought that wouldnt work for x reason, but ok
[13:19:55] <robertmaxrees> then in your loop, myGetCall.then(function(myData) { $someElement.append(myData.someProp) });
[13:20:01] <robertmaxrees> the way you were doing it wouldn't.
[13:20:27] <JZA> oooh...
[13:24:34] <JZA> so I have something like this: https://pastebin.mozilla.org/8904192
[13:25:29] <JZA> I can hear the slap of the facepalm... jaja
[13:25:30] <JZA> haha
[13:26:22] <robertmaxrees> ?
[13:26:25] <robertmaxrees> so what's the issue?
[13:26:49] <JZA> nothing, still getting the seatCall.clone is not a function, so is still doing it wrong
[13:27:04] <robertmaxrees> where are you calling seatCall.clone()
[13:27:05] <JZA> no change..
[13:27:05] <robertmaxrees> ?
[13:27:11] <robertmaxrees> i see seat.clone().appendTo($('.row')); in this code.
[13:27:14] <robertmaxrees> is that what you mean?
[13:27:32] <robertmaxrees> because you still can't use seatCall.clone()...
[13:27:37] <JZA> yeah
[13:27:50] <robertmaxrees> so that seat.clone() should be seatCall.clone()?
[13:28:05] <JZA> thats what I did
[13:28:16] <robertmaxrees> that is not in the paste you just shared.
[13:28:30] <robertmaxrees> https://bpaste.net/show/1a0fcab7e61d
[13:28:32] <JZA> I did it on the code
[13:28:43] <JZA> live code
[13:28:46] <robertmaxrees> the code you shared to the channel didn't have that change.
[13:28:46] <robertmaxrees> soooo
[13:28:50] <robertmaxrees> didn't see it.
[13:28:55] <robertmaxrees> look at that bpaste.
[13:29:04] <robertmaxrees> your append logic needs to be in your .then() callback there.
[13:29:19] <robertmaxrees> instead of what you're doing.
[13:29:38] <JZA> ok I got something similar.
[13:29:57] <JZA> but then how do I append it to the #row tag
[13:30:18] <robertmaxrees> how would you normally append something using javascript or jquery?
[13:30:18] <JZA> .appendTo($('.row'));
[13:30:36] <robertmaxrees> or $('.row').append(somethinghere);
[13:31:01] <robertmaxrees> both do the same.
[13:31:05] <JZA> ok
[13:32:32] <JZA> like this: https://bpaste.net/show/f0994329964a
[13:32:40] <robertmaxrees> no.
[13:32:44] <robertmaxrees> inside the .then() callback.
[13:32:49] <robertmaxrees> .then() does not return the element.
[13:33:17] <JZA> I got the same: TypeError: seatCall.then(...).appendTo is not a function
[13:33:21] <robertmaxrees> ...
[13:33:21] <robertmaxrees> yes.
[13:33:25] <JZA> oh
[13:33:28] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:35:24] <rubyonrailed> Can someone help me use ajax to make this request to the zendesk api?  I Have my code + error i'm getting.  https://gist.github.com/anonymous/e5e211c95db30f446c489385c2d479c5
[13:35:42] <rubyonrailed> type is actually GET though
[13:36:16] <robertmaxrees> did you read the error rubyonrailed?
[13:39:38] <taplar> i love infinite loops in ff
[13:39:47] <robertmaxrees> the best right?
[13:40:33] <taplar> i was trying to do an image load event listener version of his svg thing, heh.  screwed the pooch on one of the appends
[13:56:17] <Aljone> $('.wc-bookings-booking-form fieldset').on( 'date-selected', function() { < what is 'date-selected' i dont understand
[13:56:26] <robertmaxrees> a custom event
[13:57:03] <Aljone> i see
[13:58:24] <Aljone> anyway thats not working on safari
[13:58:33] <robertmaxrees> what isn't?
[13:58:39] <Aljone> that event
[13:58:46] <robertmaxrees> show some code that's failing.
[13:58:58] <Aljone> i dont know , how do i see console on safari?
[13:59:16] <robertmaxrees> wut
[13:59:25] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.apple.com/safari/tools/
[13:59:33] <robertmaxrees> (shrug)
[13:59:46] <robertmaxrees> oh here: https://developer.apple.com/library/iad/documentation/AppleApplications/Conceptual/Safari_Developer_Guide/GettingStarted/GettingStarted.html
[13:59:57] <Aljone> ok
[14:01:13] <Aljone>  Syntax error, unrecognized expression: input[name=wc_bookings_field_start_date_month
[14:01:27] <robertmaxrees> so show your code.
[14:01:38] <robertmaxrees> use a bpaste or something.
[14:01:42] <Aljone> i will add quotes
[14:02:17] <robertmaxrees> yeah traditionally you wrap attribute values in quotes.
[14:02:42] <Aljone> actually i found the bug
[14:02:51] <Aljone> its missing the ended ]
[14:03:00] <robertmaxrees> though i wouldn't use an attribute selector.
[14:20:21] <JZA> I gave up, too manyholes.
[14:24:00] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[14:24:01] <robertmaxrees> lol
[14:24:02] <robertmaxrees> 'kay.
[14:24:29] <codingCookie> hey guys, maybe you could help me understanding smartphones... why iphones doesn't support "jquery.on("click tap", functions" ?
[14:25:20] <robertmaxrees> what's jquery.on() supposed to be?
[14:26:32] <robertmaxrees> also: pretty sure there's no "tap" event.
[14:29:56] <codingCookie> even with touch it doesn't work, poorly, btw on my android it worked perfectly
[14:30:30] <robertmaxrees> "touch" isn't really an event either...
[14:30:39] <robertmaxrees> touchstart, touchmove, touchend, touchcancel...
[14:30:45] <robertmaxrees> try touchstart instead.
[14:31:04] <taplar> i usually go for touchend
[14:31:10] <taplar> in case they scroll
[14:31:18] <robertmaxrees> good point.
[14:50:03] <codingCookie> ok i tried everything, tomorrow is another day :) I forget to thank for your help guys :)
[15:10:33] <JZA> ok second try
[15:11:00] <JZA> I got this SVG dashboard which I import I add elemnts to a class, now I want those elements to change the style 'onLoad', so I put
[15:11:37] <JZA> $('.myseat').ready(function () {  $.css('fill-opacity', 0.3); });   what I missed, I get the error: TypeError: a.replace is not a function.
[15:11:47] <robertmaxrees> 2 things.
[15:12:21] <robertmaxrees> .ready() is meant for $(document)
[15:12:34] <robertmaxrees> it won't work the way you want it to.
[15:12:43] <robertmaxrees> 2: $.css('fill-opacity', 0.3); huh?
[15:12:53] <robertmaxrees> what are you expecting this to do.
[15:13:51] <willc> What about: $(document).ready(function(){$('.myseat').css('opacity':'0.3');});
[15:13:58] <robertmaxrees> that'll only fire on pageload.
[15:14:04] <robertmaxrees> only once.
[15:14:25] <robertmaxrees> why are you setting the opacity like that?  why not just to it via normal css?
[15:15:16] <JZA> because I want to tie it to events.
[15:15:45] <robertmaxrees> then add/remove a class.
[15:15:52] <JZA> I will add click events
[15:16:19] <robertmaxrees> *add click event handlers.
[15:16:37] <robertmaxrees> and yeah, so you set default styling in your css, and then you add/remnove classes using js.
[15:16:58] <willc> What about: $(document).ready(function(){$('.myseat').on('click',function(){ $(this).toggleClass('className'); }); });?
[15:17:03] <JZA> then I need to target the id.
[15:17:09] <robertmaxrees> no you don't.
[15:17:18] <robertmaxrees> you can target $(this) inside the handler.
[15:17:18] <JZA> how do I call the element to add the class?
[15:17:31] <JZA> this is the page: http://alexandro.biz/assets/bar2.html
[15:17:34] <robertmaxrees> $('.someClass').on('click', function() { $(this).removeClass(); });
[15:17:35] <robertmaxrees> or whatever.
[15:17:52] <robertmaxrees> check out http://learn.jquery.com/events/
[15:18:01] <robertmaxrees> really good primer on event handling.
[15:18:08] <JZA> I have hover already to change color, but I want to load on opacity .3 by default, and then light up dpeendinon availabilyt.
[15:18:22] <JZA> * depending on availability
[15:18:41] <robertmaxrees> how are you determining availability?
[15:19:13] <JZA> on a json object.
[15:19:38] <robertmaxrees> okay - so you'll still have to tie the two together.  so you set that default in your site styles and then change things in a document ready.
[15:20:28] <JZA> so let say seat A-1 is not avialble, I will get 'what' to add the class 'noseat' for example.
[15:20:56] <robertmaxrees> you have to have something in the JSON that'll tie that back to the seat.
[15:21:07] <robertmaxrees> i'd use data attributes.
[15:24:47] <JZA> ok so I will need something like forEach(id; id.next())... $this.addlclass.('yes_seat')
[15:24:56] <robertmaxrees> wut
[15:25:16] <JZA> to iterate through the id's of the json, and the svg.
[15:25:27] <robertmaxrees>  forEach(id; id.next()) is where you lost me.
[15:25:41] <robertmaxrees> if the JSON is an array, you can use forEach(), but that's not the signature of it.
[15:26:34] <JZA> this is a sample: {"zone":"D-1", "seats": { "D-1-A-1": "Y", "D-1-A-2": "N", ...}
[15:26:40] <robertmaxrees> you can't use forEach then.
[15:26:42] <JZA> of the json
[15:27:02] <robertmaxrees> are you trying to read the seats object?
[15:27:16] <JZA> yeah
[15:27:45] <robertmaxrees> i'd use jquery's .each() and get a data attribute that maps to those values and go that way.
[15:27:49] <robertmaxrees> since for loops are funky.
[15:28:11] <JZA> ok
[15:30:51] <taplar> does the object only consist of zone and seats?
[15:31:10] <JZA> yeah
[15:31:11] <robertmaxrees> i'd rethink the format of that sucka, but meh.
[15:31:29] <taplar> yeah ^ cause your zone is a part of your seat key it seems
[15:31:36] <taplar> you could just return all seats
[15:31:43] <JZA> basically is something like this form: https://jsfiddle.net/zvLoudmd/1/
[15:31:47] <JZA> but visually
[15:32:13] <JZA> yeah, I am supposed to be selecting things previously
[15:32:20] <JZA> and loading it back into another json to be pushed to the server.
[15:32:28] <robertmaxrees> i'd fix that to be an array of objects, one per seart.
[15:32:30] <robertmaxrees> *seat
[15:32:44] <JZA> fix the jquery?
[15:32:50] <robertmaxrees> >.>
[15:32:55] <taplar> the endpoint response
[15:32:56] <robertmaxrees> the JSON
[15:33:12] <Madan> hi
[15:33:20] <JZA> well is an example, I dunno how will the object be formated.
[15:33:29] <robertmaxrees> wut
[15:33:35] <JZA> but for the time being I am using that as an example.
[15:33:46] <robertmaxrees> then you can't really build anything lol
[15:33:49] <taplar> kinda important to know how an endpoint will response in order to use it
[15:34:05] <JZA> robertmaxrees: well I do know it will come from JSON
[15:34:16] <robertmaxrees> so you know how it'll be formatted?
[15:34:21] <taplar> lol
[15:34:23] <JZA> I will just need to adjust the variables
[15:34:25] <JZA> nope
[15:34:26] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[15:34:31] <robertmaxrees> then you can't build anything.
[15:34:34] <JZA> I just need to tie them
[15:34:46] <taplar> how can you tie them when you don't know where they will be?
[15:35:07] <robertmaxrees> right, and if it's formatted the "right" way, the entire way you accomplish this will change.
[15:35:09] <JZA> because still a JSON object so I still need to load them up, and parse them, and match them.
[15:35:28] <robertmaxrees> that parsing and matching step (2/3 of what you listed) could change.
[15:35:34] <JZA> sure
[15:35:38] <JZA> for now I have this.
[15:35:46] <robertmaxrees> taplar whyyyyyyy
[15:35:50] <taplar> idk
[15:36:09] <taplar> JZA you need to shore up your endpoint first
[15:36:21] <JZA> shore?
[15:36:25] <robertmaxrees> finish.
[15:36:29] <robertmaxrees> complete. finalize.
[15:36:35] <JZA> is not up to me
[15:36:36] <taplar> define what it is responsible for replying with, and make it format it in the most useful manner
[15:36:40] <robertmaxrees> then have that person finish.
[15:36:46] <JZA> lol
[15:36:49] <JZA> I dunno the person
[15:36:59] <robertmaxrees> you can't really do your job if you don't know what data you're getting back and what the format is.
[15:37:01] <JZA> is ridiculous, I just need the code to parse this json
[15:37:12] <JZA> and compare them
[15:37:29] <JZA> so are you saying is impossible to parse?
[15:37:31] <robertmaxrees> how can you guarantee any of the data you'll get back though?  like, none of this makes any sense.
[15:37:44] <robertmaxrees> no, i'm saying that you're basically doing work that may or may not be usable later.
[15:38:01] <robertmaxrees> "i don't know the format or the data i'll be getting back, but it's okay - i can just hook things up later"
[15:38:09] <JZA> because still will be a boolean value at the end of the day.
[15:38:19] <robertmaxrees> lol
[15:38:48] <JZA> so I just need a boolean switch to fade out or fade in the SVG object
[15:39:34] <JZA> is like saying I dunno what will the name of the variable would be, if it changes, then I just update the line, the result is the same.
[15:39:45] <robertmaxrees> that's not the same thing at all in this case.
[15:39:58] <robertmaxrees> you have no idea what your data will look like or what it'll even have.
[15:40:06] <robertmaxrees> which can fundamentally change how you accomplish this.
[15:40:28] <JZA> like I said it will have a boolean value
[15:40:34] <taplar> 'it'?
[15:40:38] <JZA> Y/N True/False 0/1
[15:40:50] <robertmaxrees> you're not listening.
[15:40:53] <taplar> i know what a boolean is man.  what will have it?
[15:40:55] <robertmaxrees> the final value doesn't really matte rmuch.
[15:41:07] <robertmaxrees> your data format can fundamentally change the whole thing.
[15:41:13] <taplar> Y/N isn't really boolean though
[15:41:16] <robertmaxrees> ^
[15:41:47] <JZA> pl
[15:41:48] <JZA> ok
[15:42:02] <JZA> I can just make it boolean by Y=True and N = False.
[15:42:08] <robertmaxrees> that's a terrible idea.
[15:42:20] <robertmaxrees> and has nothing to do with what we're trying to tell you.
[15:43:08] <JZA> ok put me an example of how can this fail with two different JSON
[15:43:17] <rjCousineau> Hello. I'm trying to nest elements together, but the traditional .append().append() will not work because I need to loop through the nests for each nesting level.   having a hard time describing it because hard time wrapping my head around it
[15:43:27] <robertmaxrees> in one case, you'd .each() over the elements.  the other case, you'd forEach over the array.
[15:43:38] <robertmaxrees> rjCousineau make a fiddle maybe?
[15:43:43] <rjCousineau> maybe yea
[15:43:47] <taplar> rjCousineau: append() returns the element it acts upon
[15:43:48] <JZA> ok so the serialization is the issue
[15:43:55] <taplar> so if your trying to append to what you just appended, it won't work
[15:44:10] <robertmaxrees> JZA the format of the data is the issue.  that's literally what we've been talking about this entire time.
[15:44:33] <JZA> but the serailization part is somewhat indpendent to what I am doing right now.
[15:44:46] <taplar> how is it independent?
[15:44:55] <JZA> because I am not coding serialization right now.
[15:45:04] <JZA> I am coding the behavior of the dashboard.
[15:45:20] <taplar> which, for what your trying to do, depends on the response being in a certain pattern
[15:45:24] <robertmaxrees> ^^^^
[15:45:49] <robertmaxrees> unless you highly decouple things.
[15:46:59] <JZA> well it feels like this is how a table layout will be to make it <li> or <ol>
[15:47:15] <relipse> http://theta-carousel.com/carousel-example.html#example=slideshow <-- does anyone know anything else like this for free or a cost
[15:47:36] <robertmaxrees> wut
[15:47:43] <taplar> i'm lost.  table layout...
[15:48:27] <robertmaxrees> relipse you mean a carousel?
[15:48:41] <relipse> robertmaxrees no i mean a carousel that looks extroadanary
[15:48:46] <robertmaxrees> lol
[15:49:03] * taplar breaks out some john legend
[15:49:08] <robertmaxrees> "extraordinary carousel" would be a good band name.
[15:49:36] <taplar> first tour, Ride the Pony
[15:49:40] <willc> relipse, so a carousel with a for loop in each slide?
[15:49:49] <robertmaxrees> and relipse i'd rethink using a carousel in the first place.
[15:49:54] <JZA> ok lets go back, how do I get the classes on the elements?
[15:50:11] <robertmaxrees> JZA why would you want the classes?
[15:50:12] <relipse> no look at that carousel, its got image reflections and looks 3d
[15:50:29] <robertmaxrees> JZA are you trying to get a unique ID on there?
[15:50:34] <JZA> robertmaxrees: didn't you recommend getting css classes instead of the .css()?
[15:50:48] <robertmaxrees> for the styling, sure.
[15:50:54] <robertmaxrees> .addClass() and .removeClass() are your friend.
[15:51:29] <robertmaxrees> have you run through the learning center at all?
[15:51:42] <rjCousineau> jsfiddle: https://jsfiddle.net/osut610w/   see line 94 for comment
[15:52:04] <willc> .toggleCass()?
[15:52:10] <willc> class*
[15:52:18] <robertmaxrees> willc you can use that, too.  though i avoid toggles as much as possible tbh.
[15:52:52] <willc> robertmaxrees, reason?
[15:53:19] <robertmaxrees> i tend to prefer explicitly managing state in case i want to control things differently.
[15:53:29] <robertmaxrees> it's always those cases down the road that bite me.
[15:53:47] <taplar> rjCousineau: is there a reason your using pre vs doing it with styling?
[15:54:10] <rjCousineau> taplar: lazy
[15:54:24] <taplar> :/ seems like pre would be harder
[15:54:39] <rjCousineau> taplar: just needed to debug
[15:55:59] <taplar> also you know your el() method exists already in jquery right?
[15:56:13] <robertmaxrees> also: inArray
[15:56:16] <robertmaxrees> already exists.
[15:56:17] <robertmaxrees> :)
[15:56:36] <rjCousineau> awesome! I didn't know that
[15:57:01] <taplar> $('<div>', { class: 'whatever', ... });
[15:57:30] <robertmaxrees> iirc they don't want people using the object syntax any more but i could have that wrong.
[15:57:47] <taplar> they deprecating it?
[15:58:02] <robertmaxrees> maybe?
[15:58:14] <robertmaxrees> i can remember now actually.  i may very well be mixing that up.
[15:58:29] <robertmaxrees> that might be my own distaste for using jquery as a templating engine actually.
[15:58:31] <robertmaxrees> soo
[15:58:54] <taplar> i rarely use it.  just in the toolbox.
[15:58:59] <robertmaxrees> yeah
[15:59:40] <rjCousineau> when I loop through nests, I got $('<ul>').append(...)  but it all closes. so on the next loop, i can't easily continue the .append without reselection
[16:02:08] <robertmaxrees> var $myNewUL = $('<ul>'); $myNewUL.append('<li>'); $myNewUL.find('li').text('lol');
[16:02:16] <robertmaxrees> lots of ways to skin that cat
[16:02:33] <robertmaxrees> or you can create the li like the ul, manipulate that, and then append it to the UL.
[16:02:54] <rjCousineau> what about.  $('<li>').appendTo('ul',nestcount) ?
[16:02:58] <rjCousineau> er.
[16:03:18] <robertmaxrees> this is why i usually don't suggest people use jquery for lots of templating.
[16:03:22] <rjCousineau> what would the selection query be for nested UL's?  .eq(i) ?
[16:03:33] <taplar> it should also be stated that it is not closing
[16:03:36] <taplar> it's not html
[16:03:39] <taplar> your creating dom nodes
[16:03:52] <taplar> something to keep in mind
[16:04:09] <robertmaxrees> yeah, $('<ul>') creates a documentFragment for you, and everything in there is already closed.
[16:05:30] <taplar> from my brief look at this, personally i feel this logic could do with a function call
[16:06:01] <rjCousineau> maybe
[16:06:22] <taplar> something like, addElement(context, indentation)
[16:06:26] <taplar> or whatever
[16:06:47] <taplar> which can keep calling itself as indentation grows
[16:06:55] <taplar> recursively
[16:06:58] <robertmaxrees> recursion is recursion is recursion
[16:07:02] <taplar> :)
[16:07:38] <rjCousineau> taplar: jsfiddle? hehe
[16:07:53] <taplar> got stuff going on the office.  can't fiddle much right now
[16:08:06] <rjCousineau> np
[16:18:36] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/sbfwdh17/
[16:23:14] <rjCousineau> :)
[16:24:07] <taplar> comprende?
[16:24:41] <rjCousineau> bookmarked.
[16:24:51] <rjCousineau> still reading it
[16:25:39] <rjCousineau> thats brilliant
[16:25:40] <rjCousineau> thanks
[16:25:46] <taplar> sure
[16:27:53] <JZA> ok so finally did this, but on js, I should convert it to jquery
[16:29:44] <arc_> JZA why?
[16:29:59] <JZA> well I think it will be more cohesive.
[16:30:06] <robertmaxrees> wut
[16:30:29] <JZA> well I am using a JS for and a .addClass() think is a bit all over the place
[16:31:13] <JZA> http://dpaste.com/1JSZ5PW
[16:32:08] <JZA> so line 5 could have been done as an .each() or something along those lines, maybe.
[16:32:40] <taplar> could also be done with a pseudoselector
[16:33:48] <taplar> $('[id^="seat"]).addClass('noseat');
[16:34:29] <taplar> $('img').filter('[id^="seat"]).addClass('noseat'); <-- maybe make it a little better
[16:34:39] <robertmaxrees> or give them a class.
[16:34:52] <taplar> yah, though that would negate the need for that statement all together, :)
[16:37:28] <JZA> how do I increment the variable thought?
[16:38:03] <JZA> $("seat"+i)...
[16:38:10] <robertmaxrees> you wouldn't need to in this case.
[16:38:34] <robertmaxrees> you're looping through all available #seatX elements and adding a class
[16:38:40] <robertmaxrees> literally no reason to loop there.
[16:38:52] <robertmaxrees> $('.seats').addClass('lol')
[16:42:04] <JZA> so now I need a conditional for removing the class in case of the json (please lets not go into that one) LOL.
[16:42:35] <robertmaxrees> just gotta match the two.
[16:44:26] <robertmaxrees> $('.seat').each(function() { /* check myJSON.someProp[$(this).data('seat-id')] and go from there or whatever */ });
[16:44:39] <robertmaxrees> or you could .filter() and then .removeClass() en masse
[16:44:48] <robertmaxrees> though really you should do the addcalss bit server-side.
[16:44:50] <robertmaxrees> by default.
[16:46:53] <JZA> right.. is a bit useless now that I think about it.
[16:47:12] <robertmaxrees> (shrug)
[16:47:53] <robertmaxrees> or you could just use the addClass to do the availability class.
[16:47:59] <robertmaxrees> and let the default state be whatever
[16:50:21] <JZA> ok first lets get this class by default
[17:10:40] <wish^> Hi. I am building some DOM elements with javascript and normal event handlers do not seem to work on the generated elements. So i used  http://paste.ubuntu.com/23083190/, this seems to work well for the event trigger. But how can i target that element with $(this) seeing as it still refers to the parent?
[17:11:11] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[17:11:22] <robertmaxrees> base.secondStep.on('change', base.secondDropdown, function() { - is this supposed to be a jquery event binding?
[17:12:05] <wish^> ???
[17:12:10] <wish^> robertmaxrees, ?
[17:12:19] <taplar> what is 'secondStep'?
[17:12:23] <robertmaxrees> wish^ are you using jquery or some other library for this?
[17:12:36] <robertmaxrees> if it's jquery, that's not how you use a delegated listener.
[17:12:47] <wish^> I have declared selectors as variables cause i use them in alot of places
[17:13:10] <taplar> what is 'secondStep'?
[17:13:44] <wish^> secondStep is a div that holds the Dropdown elements
[17:13:49] <robertmaxrees> $(this) is the element targeted by the second argument in the call to .on()
[17:13:52] <taplar> Element or jQuery element?
[17:14:31] <wish^> Jquery element base.secondStep = $('.second_step');
[17:14:37] <taplar> k
[17:14:39] <robertmaxrees> that's not valid.
[17:14:44] <robertmaxrees> you have to pass a selector.
[17:14:48] <robertmaxrees> not a jquery object.
[17:15:07] <wish^> in the second argument you mean?
[17:15:10] <robertmaxrees> yes.
[17:16:12] <wish^> So it takes a string ?
[17:16:19] <robertmaxrees> yes, a selector string.
[17:18:59] <wish^> hmm, ok.
[17:19:09] <robertmaxrees> sup?
[17:19:14] <robertmaxrees> $() selects current elements on the page.
[17:19:20] <robertmaxrees> can't see what's coming next.
[17:19:36] <robertmaxrees> since a delegated listener doesn't care about the child element objects, etc.
[17:21:02] <wish^> Ok, cheers
[17:26:56] <JZA> I keep gettng some error about missing ; before statement.
[17:26:59] <JZA> http://dpaste.com/07KCP02
[17:27:37] <robertmaxrees> return item key + ':' + item.value;
[17:27:41] <robertmaxrees> item key isn't a think.
[17:27:49] <robertmaxrees> do you mean item.key?
[17:27:58] <robertmaxrees> but then "key" won't be defined.
[17:28:00] <JZA> right
[17:28:22] <robertmaxrees> so what is that supposed to be?
[17:28:41] <JZA> supposed to get the sample JSON
[17:29:00] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[17:29:45] <robertmaxrees> what is item key supposed to be in your code?
[17:33:50] <JZA> the id of the seat, althought is a nested json, {  "zone" : 1, "seat" { "seat1" : true, "seat2" : false, ...
[17:34:44] <robertmaxrees> make a fiddle, yo.
[17:34:54] <JZA> oops ..."seats" : [{ "seat1": true, "seat2": true,....
[17:34:56] <JZA> hold on
[17:35:07] <robertmaxrees> simplified test cases are legit af
[17:39:17] <JZA> let see this is what I have so far: https://jsfiddle.net/nkq3htcu/2/
[17:39:38] <robertmaxrees> sooo what does the data look like.
[17:39:48] <JZA> like nothing yet, :D
[17:39:53] <robertmaxrees> (use that instead of the getJS..
[17:39:58] <robertmaxrees> then i cannot help you.
[17:40:06] <JZA> I still need to create the conditional to match the key with the id of the SVG
[17:40:07] <robertmaxrees> this is what taplar and i were telling you before.
[17:40:19] <JZA> which for sakes of example I make them the same.
[17:40:24] <robertmaxrees> you cannot do this part until you have the data format.
[17:40:41] <JZA> well I just make one up
[17:40:46] <robertmaxrees> ...
[17:41:20] <robertmaxrees> are you asking how to use .map()?
[17:41:39] <robertmaxrees> i don't know how i'm supposed to help you work with an array if you don't kno wwhat it'll look like.
[17:42:01] <JZA> you are right, maybe I should just do an array.
[17:42:06] <robertmaxrees> wut
[17:42:18] <robertmaxrees> i'm so lost at this point.
[17:42:48] <JZA> well if JSON is such a controvetial topic, I might just do an array with boolean data, and try to execute the SVG addClass
[17:43:00] <robertmaxrees> uh
[17:43:06] <JZA> so myarray = [1,0,1,1,0,1];
[17:43:08] <robertmaxrees> json isn't a "controversial topic"
[17:43:11] <robertmaxrees> and that's even worse.
[17:43:32] <JZA> I should get classes on 1,3,4,6 seat.
[17:43:41] <JZA> or rather removed classes.
[17:43:44] <robertmaxrees> uh
[17:43:47] <robertmaxrees> you're overcomplicating this.
[17:43:56] <JZA> I think I am simplifying it
[17:44:01] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[17:44:21] <JZA> since I will deal with iterating through an array and applying the rmclass to $('#seats')
[17:44:26] <robertmaxrees> slow down.
[17:44:27] <robertmaxrees> one sec.
[17:47:09] <robertmaxrees> alright.
[17:47:10] <robertmaxrees> so
[17:47:10] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/8sw305t9/
[17:47:15] <robertmaxrees> see this?
[17:47:30] <JZA> looking
[17:47:40] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/8sw305t9/1/ better formatting
[17:51:46] <Guest47547> hello
[17:52:06] <robertmaxrees> hello
[17:52:17] <JZA> back
[17:52:32] <JZA> sorry... so yeah this is a straight json, no nested objects
[17:52:43] <robertmaxrees> ....
[17:52:46] <robertmaxrees> you're confused about what JSON is.
[17:52:47] <Guest47547> i need a jquery code that simulates a press of the enter button on a selector
[17:52:50] <JZA> however I dont see any change.
[17:52:57] <robertmaxrees> JZA that gives you a starting point.
[17:53:06] <robertmaxrees> JZA have you read the learning center yet?
[17:53:08] <JZA> I mean, I dont see any inactive.
[17:53:19] <robertmaxrees> JZA correct - i'm not going to do it for you.
[17:53:31] <robertmaxrees> Guest47547 enter button or are you trying to submit a form?
[17:54:09] <Guest47547> enter button here is my  stack http://stackoverflow.com/questions/39092155/how-to-click-button-with-changing-text-in-imacros
[17:54:35] <robertmaxrees> so you need something for imacros?
[17:54:36] <JZA> show me the learning center
[17:54:43] <Roboman7> yeah
[17:54:53] <JZA> so you are putting isActive on everything by default?
[17:54:53] <robertmaxrees> JZA i've linked it multiple times :) learn.jquery.com
[17:55:03] <robertmaxrees> JZA nope.
[17:55:11] <robertmaxrees> JZA i'm putting nothing on all of them by default.
[17:55:26] <Roboman7> im using  javascript to run everything which i will put the jquery into
[17:56:09] <robertmaxrees> Roboman7 okay, so you want to target the "tweet to" button?
[17:56:24] <Roboman7> yeah :)
[17:56:48] <robertmaxrees> you should start here: http://learn.jquery.com/using-jquery-core/selecting-elements/
[17:57:07] <JZA> so according to http://api.jquery.com/jquery.map/ just iterate through the array, great.
[17:57:15] <robertmaxrees> JZA that's not the same map.
[17:57:42] <robertmaxrees> different function.
[17:58:05] <matte0> Hi everyone, I'm having some trouble with insertBefore, in case anyone would like to help with what should be a simple problem.
[17:58:16] <taplar> i like simple
[17:58:21] <robertmaxrees> matte0 ask your question to the channel - if somebody can help, they will :)
[17:58:28] <taplar> they call me simple taplar.  i'm a happy dude
[17:58:33] <robertmaxrees> hahahahaha
[17:58:39] <taplar> wut?
[17:58:43] <JZA> so I am lost what exactly am I supposed to see or learn.
[17:58:52] <robertmaxrees> jquery
[17:59:03] <matte0> Thank you taplar, I appreciate it
[17:59:11] <robertmaxrees> you're asking a lot of questions that are covered in the docs and in the learning center.
[17:59:54] <matte0> I have an input with a known id, and I want to insert some html before it's parent element
[18:00:43] <taplar> ok, so that's like $('#theid').closest('.parentSelector').insertBefore
[18:00:54] <robertmaxrees> other way around iirc.
[18:01:00] <taplar> ah
[18:01:05] <robertmaxrees> use .before() instead.
[18:01:49] <taplar> simple taplar strikes again
[18:03:05] <matte0> ok, let me try that out, many thanks
[18:06:36] <adamsilver> how do I change this to say "only the checkboxes inside a form that has xyz id: $(document).on('change', 'input:checkbox', function (e) {
[18:06:51] <robertmaxrees> *checkbox
[18:07:01] <ZoderUck> hello
[18:07:02] <robertmaxrees> only one element can have a given ID.
[18:07:33] <robertmaxrees> adamsilver but you can pass a full selector there - .on('change', 'form input:checkbox', function(e) {
[18:08:10] <matte0> Hi again Taplar, unfortunately that didn't work. Is there something obviously wrong with the following: $("#myID").closest("li").before("<p>Hi</p>")
[18:08:36] <taplar> so your not seeing the Hi show up?
[18:08:50] <matte0> no, it doesn't appear
[18:08:55] <robertmaxrees> matte0 how many elements have that ID btw?
[18:09:02] <adamsilver> robertmaxrees: ah cool, this worked. I didn't know I can pass any selector like this
[18:09:11] <robertmaxrees> also: you're trying to insert a <p> before an <li> - that's not valid html.
[18:09:19] <taplar> ^
[18:09:21] <robertmaxrees> adamsilver yeah - def.
[18:09:30] <taplar> i'd assume the Hi would show some where after the list
[18:09:33] <ZoderUck> if i select a list of label elements that matches   a classes,  and the result is a list of labels.  is one assignment  .innerhtml enough to assign all the elements in the list?
[18:09:54] <robertmaxrees> ZoderUck are you using jquery?
[18:10:26] <ZoderUck> $('label[class=’lbl_value’ ').innerhtml = blaValue;  yes javascript or jquery
[18:10:36] <robertmaxrees> you can't mix them.
[18:10:42] <taplar> invalid selector
[18:10:47] <ZoderUck> ow, ok it is jquery what i use
[18:10:47] <matte0> Thank you for pointing out the invalid HTML, robertmaxrees - I'll correct it. I should note that the following does work, though the text appears before every li, which is not desired: $("<p>Hi</p>").insertBefore("li:parent");
[18:10:51] <taplar> missing ] and unescaped single quotes
[18:10:54] <robertmaxrees> and just do $('.lbl_value');
[18:11:22] <ZoderUck> hmn that is possible too, i think, not sure
[18:11:38] <ZoderUck> but i need to address  all the innerhtml, i need to put a html text in there
[18:11:46] <ZoderUck> for all the elements that matches the jquery selector
[18:11:47] <robertmaxrees> use .text() or .html()
[18:12:19] <ZoderUck> and i dont need to itterate ?
[18:12:29] <ZoderUck> trough all the elements?
[18:12:34] <taplar> jQuery will for you
[18:12:36] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/text/
[18:12:43] <robertmaxrees> "[...] or set the text contents of the matched elements."
[18:13:02] <taplar> which is related to what matte0 is seeing, :)
[18:13:10] <robertmaxrees> ahyup
[18:14:24] <ZoderUck> robert, with [ .. ] could you give an example ?    you mean like this $('label[class=’lbl_value’ ').innerhtml( newValue );
[18:14:36] <robertmaxrees> ...
[18:14:43] <robertmaxrees> did you read the page?
[18:14:47] <taplar> why do you want to use an attribute selector?
[18:14:48] <robertmaxrees> also: $('label[class=’lbl_value’ '). isn't a thing.
[18:15:07] <robertmaxrees> use $('.lbl_value’)
[18:15:13] <robertmaxrees> and use .text() and .html()
[18:15:15] <robertmaxrees> easy peasy.
[18:15:40] <ZoderUck> ok, i am not sure i am afraid    $('.lbl_value’)  matches too much elements, but fine,
[18:15:47] <ZoderUck> ok. i understand.
[18:15:51] <taplar> it's the exact same, but without the dom scan
[18:16:02] <ZoderUck> wait i give you the page link, can i do this?
[18:16:08] <robertmaxrees> please don't :(
[18:16:12] <ZoderUck> ow
[18:16:12] <ZoderUck> ok
[18:16:20] <robertmaxrees> isolated test cases are best.
[18:16:55] <ZoderUck> so   $('label[class=’lbl_value’ ')   scannes  the labels more then   $(‘.lbl_value’)
[18:17:13] <robertmaxrees> duder lol
[18:17:20] <robertmaxrees> $('label[class=’lbl_value’ ')  this doesn't do anything.
[18:17:21] <ZoderUck> well the dom
[18:17:23] <robertmaxrees> it's not valid.
[18:17:32] <ZoderUck> no of course not
[18:17:39] <ZoderUck>  $('label[class=’lbl_value’ )
[18:17:40] <robertmaxrees> do you want all labels with that class?
[18:17:45] <ZoderUck> yes
[18:17:46] <ZoderUck> correct.
[18:17:47] <robertmaxrees> that's still not valid.
[18:17:47] <taplar> attribute selectors can be on anything.  so it has to check everything
[18:17:53] <robertmaxrees> and just do $('label.lbl_value')
[18:18:05] <taplar> but classes/ids are mapped by the browser special, so it can quick look them up
[18:18:07] <robertmaxrees> though that's a bad classname to use if you're sharing it.
[18:18:36] <ZoderUck> ow ok.   so $('label.lbl_value').text( new_decimal_value );
[18:18:45] <robertmaxrees> try it ;)
[18:18:47] <ZoderUck> how would you call the classname
[18:19:00] <robertmaxrees> what do you mean?
[18:19:03] <ZoderUck> the goal of the label is to put a calculated  calory TDEE value 4 digits
[18:19:26] <taplar> 'tdee-value' ?
[18:19:28] <ZoderUck> you did mention that the classname was poorly choosen.
[18:19:40] <ZoderUck> uh yes that is better
[18:19:43] <ZoderUck> i think, yes
[18:19:46] <robertmaxrees> brb
[18:19:53] <JZA> ok I read the whole page, not much on JSON, but great read.
[18:19:58] <JZA> now what can I do with that?
[18:20:29] <ZoderUck> i do this because i have a small, medium and big  layout,  and the label is present in every layout,  so the calculated value need to be placed in all 3  places
[18:20:50] <ZoderUck> ok thanks
[18:21:57] <taplar> JZA: what is your current issue?
[18:21:58] <ZoderUck> ow wait, robertmax, if the label does have extra classes  will  $('label.tdee_value')  still select ?
[18:22:16] <taplar> ZoderUck: yep
[18:22:29] <taplar> the selector does not have to be an exact match
[18:22:38] <JZA> taplar: I need to remove the class of the SVG elements that present a true value off the json value.
[18:22:46] <taplar> the selector has to match, but the element can have extra stuff
[18:22:48] <JZA> this is the JSON value: http://alexandro.biz/assets/js/seats.json
[18:23:28] <taplar> ok, what have you tried?
[18:23:45] <JZA> so I will have if(myid == myjsonobject.key)
[18:23:59] <JZA> so far I have only tried to iterate throught he json by doing getJSON()
[18:24:07] <JZA> http://dpaste.com/07KCP02
[18:24:37] <JZA> so now I have item.key  however my first question is, what about the nested objects?
[18:24:49] <taplar> your only interested in the ones that are true, right?
[18:25:00] <JZA> right.
[18:26:09] <JZA> so if (item.value == true).rmClass('noseat')
[18:28:37] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/btqjyqr4/
[18:28:57] <ZoderUck> taplar: aha thanks, i did have some color classes after   tdee_value class
[18:28:58] <ZoderUck> thanks
[18:29:29] <taplar> i don't see 'items' in that json
[18:30:07] <JZA> right, thats a bug
[18:30:09] <matte0> taplar, thank you for the help. I set up a jsfiddle, and verified that your suggestion works fine there. My Qualtrics environment must be interfering.
[18:30:33] <JZA> should have been seats.seat.map() maybe?
[18:31:12] <ZoderUck> i do this small for a friend 1) to gain experience with css/html  2) witouth anycost for that friend,   wordpress BeTheme does this have a grid class system? i could not find the info
[18:31:26] <taplar> your json has two keys, 'zone' and 'seats'
[18:32:14] <taplar> ZoderUck: i'm unfamiliar with wordpress, others may know, or there may be a channel for it
[18:32:19] <JZA> taplar: yeah I only need seats
[18:32:50] <JZA> and then iterate through the key/values
[18:33:02] <taplar> alright, so update that fiddle
[18:33:33] <JZA> https://jsfiddle.net/btqjyqr4/1/
[18:34:01] <JZA> keep getting seatdata.seat is undefined
[18:34:06] <taplar> yep
[18:34:25] <JZA> nor seatdata.seats.map ...
[18:34:52] <taplar> so what is 'seats'?
[18:35:53] <JZA> seats is the second key isnt it?
[18:36:04] <taplar> what type of element is it?
[18:36:06] <JZA> not sure how to 'browse' through the keys.
[18:36:15] <JZA> is a nested array
[18:36:16] <taplar> string, number, array, object, ...
[18:36:20] <taplar> is it?
[18:36:38] <JZA> object I guess
[18:36:41] <JZA> {}
[18:36:43] <taplar> yep
[18:36:53] <taplar> so is map a valid function for Object ?
[18:40:14] <JZA> taplar: ok according to doc is a method to change from one set of values to another
[18:40:29] <taplar> a method off of what element type?
[18:40:43] <JZA> so I guess is good for compare values against each other, so my 'seat1...9' with my id's
[18:40:59] <taplar> no, map is used for translations
[18:41:07] <taplar> what docs are you reading?
[18:42:06] <JZA> http://www.tutorialspoint.com/jquery/traversal-map.htm
[18:42:18] <taplar> the map you are trying to use is not the jquery map
[18:42:38] <taplar> seats is an object.  it's not a jQuery object
[18:42:57] <taplar> which goes back to me asking if map is a valid function off of Object
[18:43:12] <taplar> how can you tell?
[18:43:22] <JZA> no idea. tbh
[18:43:29] <taplar> ok, two ways
[18:43:41] <taplar> first you can look up the docs: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/prototype
[18:43:59] <taplar> <thing>.prototype will tell you the methods on the thing
[18:44:04] <taplar> so in this case Object.prototype
[18:44:22] <taplar> secondly, you can do that same thing in your browser console and it will show you what methods are on the .prototype
[18:44:54] <taplar> so
[18:45:00] <taplar> does Object have a map method?
[18:45:41] <JZA> not that I can see.
[18:45:45] <JZA> on this page
[18:46:08] <taplar> nope.  it does not.  doesn't really make sense to map an object into another object.  you already have key value pairs
[18:46:43] <taplar> err, not map into an object, into an array
[18:47:08] <taplar> however the jQuery map may let you do that
[18:47:19] <taplar> so where are the docs for that guy?
[18:47:59] <JZA> which guy?
[18:48:06] <taplar> jQuery.map
[18:48:30] <JZA> this one? http://api.jquery.com/jquery.map/
[18:48:40] <taplar> yep, so look at the versions
[18:48:45] <taplar> does one of them take in an object?
[18:49:01] <JZA> I see so it also complaint with objects.
[18:49:03] <JZA> yeah
[18:49:05] <taplar> :)
[18:49:37] <JZA> so do I need to apply a makeArray( myJSON);?
[18:49:54] <taplar> no, your interested in the version two.  you can click on it and it will take you to an example
[18:50:15] <taplar> ignore the methods that are not map.  the other things are just setup for using it in the example
[18:51:48] <JZA> this one? http://api.jquery.com/map/
[18:52:06] <taplar> no you had the right docs
[18:52:18] <robertmaxrees> lol
[18:52:36] <JZA> ok well I only see version 1.0 and 1.6
[18:52:52] <taplar> your after the 1.6 one right?  you have an object, not an array
[18:53:02] <JZA> right
[18:53:26] <taplar> so looking at the usage of $.map, try using it in the fiddle and console logging what gets passed in to see what it's doing
[18:57:04] <JZA> this is the example where I got it from: https://www.sitepoint.com/ajaxjquery-getjson-simple-example/
[18:57:16] <JZA> on 'The Sample Javascript'
[18:57:30] <JZA> basically iterate through an HTML
[18:57:40] <taplar> sure, but items there is probably an array
[18:57:58] <taplar> yep
[18:58:02] <taplar> your case is not
[18:58:27] <taplar> your trying to peal an apple like a banana
[18:58:35] <taplar> not the same fruit bro yo, ;)
[18:58:40] <JZA> ok
[18:59:11] <taplar> so fiddle around with $.map and see what you come up with
[18:59:23] <JZA> I didnt know that JSON could be so different from each other, usually in python is just import json and json.load and print(json[key1][key2][0]) voila!!
[18:59:40] <taplar> it's all syntax
[18:59:47] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[18:59:48] <taplar> arrays do not have the same methods as objects
[19:00:04] <taplar> if your json creates objects, you can't do array methods on them
[19:00:46] <taplar> and js doesn't do associative arrays really
[19:00:50] <robertmaxrees> ^^^^
[19:01:32] <JZA> ok
[19:03:10] <taplar> i'll catch you guys later though.  past time for me to run, ^_^
[19:03:16] <robertmaxrees> GET OUTTA ERE
[19:03:21] <taplar> hell yeah!
[19:03:23] <taplar> l8r
[19:12:41] <NLBlackEagle> hey guys, after working for 3 days on a .svg file without success I´m looking for other ways to create a image that consists out of multiple layers and can be seperately be called using jquery
[19:13:28] <robertmaxrees> an image or...?
[19:13:46] <NLBlackEagle> the class=¨some-shape¨ doesnt works somehow, here´s a example: http://www.craftrealms.org/indexexample.php
[19:14:09] <robertmaxrees> you see those errors in yopur js btw?
[19:14:33] <robertmaxrees> you've got a ton of 	var lightbox_speed = ;
[19:15:13] <NLBlackEagle> Im all new to this which is one of the reasons I´m looking for another way atm, 3 days ago I wouldnt even know what jquery or .svg is
[19:15:24] <robertmaxrees> so i would fix those errors first.
[19:15:36] <robertmaxrees> also: jquery and svg go together about as well as lemon juice and milk.
[19:15:46] <NLBlackEagle> but would that fix my issue? since I would be spending another day or 2 to fix it
[19:15:52] <robertmaxrees> uh.
[19:15:58] <NLBlackEagle> Im all new ;)
[19:16:02] <robertmaxrees> lots of your code likely isn't actually running right now.
[19:16:26] <NLBlackEagle> I´ve been watching this tutorial which mostly does stuff using .css & html https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyBmo_VffWI
[19:16:27] <b-ot> (NLBlackEagle) HTML5 Tutorials #19 - SVG Inline and CSS Styling - length 6m 46s - 190 likes, 2 dislikes (99.0%) - 18,067 views - LevelUpTuts on 2014.06.27
[19:16:44] <robertmaxrees> so then what's your actual question?
[19:19:24] <robertmaxrees> like, are you having trouble getting your js to work?  or is it just the css/html parts that are broken?
[19:19:36] <NLBlackEagle> I want to create something like this: http://mctcp.craftrealms.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Naamloos-1.png
[19:20:24] <NLBlackEagle> I´ve tried to archieve this with .svg´s but it didnt worked so my question is... are there any other ways, and where could I find a tutorial on it?
[19:23:59] <NLBlackEagle> One of the first responses I got was ¨get into jquery to do that¨ which means I had to learn jquery while I didnt even had any experience using .css Now it happens that I do know a bit about .css and consider to do it all over again using jquery
[19:24:08] <NLBlackEagle> I just have no clue where to start atm
[19:25:26] <robertmaxrees> soooo svg and jquery don't really work together.
[19:25:54] <NLBlackEagle> true, thats why I´m asking if there are other alternative ways, what does work together with jquery?
[19:26:12] <robertmaxrees> for what you're trying to do, just learn the js + svg way.
[19:26:16] <robertmaxrees> or the css + svg way.
[19:26:34] <NLBlackEagle> Aijai, means there isnt another way haha
[19:26:52] <robertmaxrees> i mean, there are other ways to hack something like this, but i really wouldn't recommend them.
[19:27:11] <robertmaxrees> i would start simple in a jsfiddle or something if I were you.
[19:27:12] <ZoderUck> uh
[19:27:38] <ZoderUck> my submit button does not  call the javascript  it did some time ago :)
[19:27:43] <robertmaxrees> ZoderUck show us.
[19:28:00] <ZoderUck> mozilla gives no error when it is loaded
[19:28:17] <robertmaxrees> (shrug) no way for us to know what's up if we can't see code ZoderUck
[19:28:54] <NLBlackEagle> robertmaxrees, what would you recommend as .svg creator?
[19:28:55] <ZoderUck> http://dev-strongfit.tk/sf-tdee/   only small and medium screen is supported, so you need to make the page 640 or less
[19:29:00] <robertmaxrees> ....
[19:29:04] <robertmaxrees> sooo where's the code?
[19:29:52] <ZoderUck> the code ow
[19:30:01] <robertmaxrees> you mean the "Bereken benodigde calorie" button?
[19:30:33] <ZoderUck> http://dev-strongfit.tk/wp-content/plugins/sf-tdee/js/form-tdee-calc-script.js
[19:30:40] <ZoderUck> uy yes
[19:30:47] <robertmaxrees> i'm getting an error when i click.
[19:31:00] <ZoderUck> yes even with zerro values  the labels and spans were filled
[19:31:51] <robertmaxrees> so what was the last thing you changed?
[19:32:09] <ZoderUck> uh the html i think
[19:32:14] <ZoderUck> long time ago 2 days ago :)
[19:32:22] <robertmaxrees> right, i'm guessing you moved some script tags around?
[19:32:41] <ZoderUck> dont know exactly, i dont get an error,  it does a php post server, but what it should have don is call the javascript onclick
[19:32:56] <robertmaxrees> right, you'll see an error before the page reloads.
[19:32:58] <robertmaxrees> $ isn't defined.
[19:33:04] <ZoderUck> ow ok wait.
[19:33:21] <robertmaxrees> you're probably using a noConflict somewhere.
[19:33:43] <ZoderUck> uh, possible, dont know :)
[19:33:55] <robertmaxrees> that's why $ isn't defined.
[19:33:59] <robertmaxrees> to figure out what changed.
[19:34:00] <ZoderUck> should i include jquery in my Calc script
[19:34:02] <robertmaxrees> ...
[19:34:03] <robertmaxrees> no.
[19:34:27] <ZoderUck> “this is why html/javascript/css”  is difficult.  hard to debug
[19:34:36] <ZoderUck> it did work
[19:34:37] <robertmaxrees> are you using git?
[19:34:43] <ZoderUck> nope
[19:34:49] <ZoderUck> xampp on windows in a directory
[19:34:58] <robertmaxrees> are you using any vcs?
[19:35:05] <robertmaxrees> subversion, mercurial, etc?
[19:35:10] <ZoderUck> i need to upload the bunch (i hate this , but i need to)
[19:35:17] <ZoderUck> visual source save
[19:35:22] <ZoderUck> 3.5
[19:35:25] <robertmaxrees> ew.
[19:35:27] <robertmaxrees> vss is awful.
[19:35:37] <robertmaxrees> either way - roll back changes until you find the last working version.
[19:35:40] <ZoderUck> ow you want me to revert back
[19:35:41] <ZoderUck> aha.
[19:35:57] <robertmaxrees> or look at the changelog and see what's up.
[19:36:16] <ZoderUck> robert, but maybe you see what is wrong, maybe  the  submit button is not in the  form or in the fieldset anymore ?
[19:36:21] <robertmaxrees> ...
[19:36:26] <robertmaxrees> i already told you what the error is.
[19:36:29] <robertmaxrees> $ isn't defined.
[19:36:35] <ZoderUck> i did not understand the error message
[19:36:44] <ZoderUck> $ = jquery is not defined
[19:36:58] <robertmaxrees> correct.
[19:37:03] <robertmaxrees> what else would $ be?
[19:37:11] <ZoderUck> o lol
[19:37:25] <ZoderUck> yes so ? i make sure jquery is loaded ?
[19:37:34] <ZoderUck> in wordpress enque script
[19:37:40] <robertmaxrees> it's loaded.
[19:37:48] <robertmaxrees> you're probably running noconflict somewhere.
[19:38:00] <ZoderUck> what is that noconflict somewhere ?
[19:38:10] <ZoderUck> is that a different version of jquery ?
[19:38:29] <robertmaxrees> i hjave no idea what you're doing on this page but something is doing https://api.jquery.com/jquery.noconflict/
[19:38:55] <ZoderUck> ow.  this is default BeTheme  wordpress theme.
[19:39:06] <robertmaxrees> so wordpress often likes to run that itself.
[19:39:27] <ZoderUck> with my plugin of course active
[19:39:33] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[19:43:33] <ZoderUck> wow, i am totally focked
[19:43:38] <robertmaxrees> ?
[19:43:42] <ZoderUck> i dont have a clue
[19:43:46] <robertmaxrees> you can just use jQuery instead of $ fwiw.
[19:43:52] <ZoderUck> and visual source save does not give anything
[19:43:53] <robertmaxrees> or wrap your code in an iife.
[19:44:10] <ZoderUck> unreal pattern ?
[19:44:14] <ZoderUck> unreveal
[19:44:14] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[19:44:17] <robertmaxrees> jQuery(function($) { /* your code here */ });
[19:44:29] <robertmaxrees> nope.  nothing to do with modules.
[19:44:31] <ZoderUck> aha ok, let me do that, yes
[19:44:49] <ZoderUck> maybe other $ conflicts
[19:45:10] <ZoderUck> or wordpress makes a minify version  which results in a conflict ?
[19:45:23] <ZoderUck> okkay i will include it in an iifi
[19:45:34] <robertmaxrees> *iife
[19:45:44] <robertmaxrees> and wordpress sets nofonclict by default but you said this worked recently sooo.
[19:46:00] <ZoderUck> ow yes
[19:46:03] <ZoderUck> i understand what is wrong
[19:46:06] <robertmaxrees> ?
[19:46:27] <ZoderUck> the whole script form-tdee-calc-script.js   was pure javascript   with document  selectors
[19:46:34] <robertmaxrees> lol
[19:46:35] <ZoderUck> and now for the first time i use $
[19:46:47] <ZoderUck> :)
[19:47:05] <ZoderUck> so how should i    change3 this javascript so i can use $ ?
[19:47:13] <ZoderUck>  $("label.val_goalweight_harris").html( goalweight_harris);
[19:47:15] <robertmaxrees> i just showerd you how.
[19:47:18] <robertmaxrees> *showed
[19:47:21] <ZoderUck> i have a whole row of $
[19:47:24] <robertmaxrees> you wrap everything with that iife
[19:47:30] <ZoderUck> ow okay  jQuery(function($) { /* your code here */ });
[19:47:32] <ZoderUck> ok
[19:47:43] <ZoderUck> there is no way i could include the jquery lib on the top ?
[19:47:49] <robertmaxrees> you already did include it.
[19:47:52] <robertmaxrees> you don't want to include it again.
[19:47:55] <ZoderUck> ow
[19:48:01] <taplar> if you didn't include it the iife wouldn't do anything
[19:48:11] <robertmaxrees> sure it would - it'd error ;)
[19:48:15] <ZoderUck> but how strange , why  cant i use it in the form-tdee-calc-script.js   script
[19:48:23] <taplar> nothing *good* :D
[19:48:23] <robertmaxrees> use what?
[19:48:56] <taplar> $ is a global variable
[19:49:19] <robertmaxrees> right, and you've already incluided jquery earlier in the page.
[19:49:22] <ZoderUck> uh do this in the script http://dev-strongfit.tk/wp-content/plugins/sf-tdee/js/form-tdee-calc-script.js
[19:49:23] <taplar> and really there is no 'in' the script.  all your scripts run on your page
[19:49:25] <robertmaxrees> including it again would breakstuff.
[19:49:34] <robertmaxrees> ....
[19:49:35] <robertmaxrees> dude.
[19:49:36] <robertmaxrees> lol
[19:49:40] <robertmaxrees> just wrap all your code in that iife.
[19:49:42] <ZoderUck> so iffie is the only whay ?
[19:49:51] <ZoderUck> an iffie annonymous ?
[19:49:55] <robertmaxrees> lol
[19:49:56] <ZoderUck> in an async ?
[19:50:10] <taplar> lol
[19:50:17] <robertmaxrees> an IIFE uses an anonymous function.  that code will fire on doc ready.
[19:50:17] <taplar> how does anonymous equate to async?
[19:50:27] <robertmaxrees> i think he's just confused about whatr does what.
[19:50:38] <ZoderUck> is that not asyncrhonious an IFFIE ?
[19:50:44] <robertmaxrees> uh
[19:50:58] <robertmaxrees> IIFEs are just a way to get a single-use scope.
[19:51:03] <taplar> Immediately Invoking Functional Expression
[19:51:20] <taplar> or Invoked
[19:51:24] <robertmaxrees> *invoked function expression
[19:51:24] <robertmaxrees> yeah
[19:51:52] <robertmaxrees> where are you getting this async question from?
[19:52:40] <ZoderUck> well i am gonne rm -Rf
[19:52:43] <ZoderUck> thanks anyway
[19:52:59] <taplar> :/
[19:56:07] <robertmaxrees> welp
[19:56:27] <taplar> did JZA get figured out?
[19:56:41] <robertmaxrees> he stopped talking after you left haha
[19:57:23] <taplar> must have been all that fruit talking i did
[20:00:13] <robertmaxrees> haha
[20:10:50] <JZA> taplar: sorry went to get some food :)
[20:10:59] <taplar> the nerve...
[20:11:07] <JZA> maybe that will help me think better
[20:21:11] <ZoderUck> hey the button works, thanks for the IFFI suggestion
[20:21:21] <ZoderUck> i had to put iffi around the whole code
[20:21:25] <taplar> IIFE
[20:26:56] <ZoderUck> taplar, yes how did you know i mean, what is that jquery( $ ) IIFE thing
[20:27:22] <taplar> heh, i was here when robert was telling you about it
[20:27:45] <taplar> are you asking what it is exactly?
[20:29:22] <JZA> tried this but gt a missing formal parameter :/
[20:29:24] <JZA> http://dpaste.com/1NWNB2B
[20:30:53] <taplar> i don't see 'val' defined
[20:32:10] <JZA> right... should be function(key, val) {..
[20:32:46] <JZA> still the same result hoguht
[20:32:48] <JZA> thought
[20:33:08] <taplar> can you make a fiddle with what your trying?
[20:33:34] <JZA> https://jsfiddle.net/btqjyqr4/2/
[20:34:34] <taplar> so what happened to the map attempt?
[20:36:29] <JZA> well I didnt really understood how can map help me with the nested object, so I guess a double loop was something I could grasp easier, in theory, I can just itearte through the objects.
[20:36:51] <JZA> and I can just manually build the array through an item push
[20:37:31] <JZA> of course first I need to somehow 'get' the values.
[20:37:51] <taplar> ok, well first your latest fiddle is using an invalid each form
[20:38:21] <taplar> $('div').each(seatdata, function(key, val) { <--- you shouldn't select elements to use taht each
[20:38:38] <taplar> it's just $.each(object/array, callback);
[20:39:04] <JZA> ok
[20:39:52] <taplar> but if your going to do an each and then push to an array, you should use map.  that's it's primary use
[20:40:34] <JZA> right but I cant get any values
[20:40:41] <JZA> not with map nor each
[20:40:48] <taplar> sure you can
[20:40:51] <JZA> keep getting this format error.
[20:41:16] <JZA> missing formal parameter, is it the $each.(val.seat2...
[20:44:48] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/btqjyqr4/4/
[20:47:11] <JZA> right but the issue is that second object.
[20:47:25] <taplar> ok?
[20:47:44] <JZA> so how do I iterate through the nested value, thats what the second for was for.
[20:48:03] <taplar> your iterating over the top object.  how would you change that?
[20:48:04] <JZA> in theory should be console.log(l, j)
[20:48:26] <JZA> thats what the val.seat was for
[20:48:40] <taplar> but by iterate over the top object if you want to do it over the sub object?
[20:48:45] <taplar> s/by/why
[20:48:45] <b-ot> Correction, <taplar> but why iterate over the top object if you want to do it over the sub object?
[20:49:41] <taplar> and why do you keep trying to access 'seat' ?
[20:49:53] <taplar> there is no key 'seat' in any part of this object
[20:51:45] <JZA> right..
[20:52:04] <JZA> but I am also not invoking any 'seat'
[20:52:26] <JZA> the seat that I invoke is the 'this'
[20:52:41] <JZA> var seat = this
[20:53:05] <taplar> commented line 29 has myseat.seat
[20:53:25] <taplar> also ln 28 was trying to do that
[20:53:30] <taplar> but back to the other question
[20:53:39] <taplar> why iterate over the top object instead of the lower one?
[20:56:55] <taplar> right?  you can access it directly with seatdata.seats
[20:57:43] <JZA> well as long as I keep getting missing formal parameters I will never know lol.
[20:57:56] <taplar> -_-, dude, step by step
[20:58:07] <taplar> change it to each on that guy instead of the top object
[20:59:55] <JZA> wow, I got it.
[21:02:34] <JZA> cool so now I got I can get the list of the true seats.
[21:07:06] <JZA> so I got this: https://jsfiddle.net/btqjyqr4/5/
[21:07:42] <JZA> not sure if its failing because the css is after the JS
[21:07:50] <taplar> i'm assuming ln 9 isn't working?
[21:07:55] <JZA> http://alexandro.biz/assets/bar2.html
[21:08:18] <antipsychiatry> Please help humanity to ABOLISH this fucking TOTAL FRAUD : psychiatry !!!!!!!!!!!!And put psychiatrists in jail. Please visit antipsychiatry.org
[21:08:57] <JZA> ok is removeClass
[21:09:33] <taplar> $('#idSelector')
[21:10:59] <JZA> well $('#'+key) didnt work
[21:11:25] <taplar> console.log(key)
[21:12:42] <JZA> I get: seat1, seat5, seat6, seat8, seat9, seat12, seat13
[21:12:59] <taplar> huh?
[21:13:09] <taplar> your doing key == true right above it
[21:13:15] <taplar> so...
[21:13:48] <taplar> oh wait, for objects it would be the key
[21:13:48] <JZA> so that should filter all the positive keys which are the same as the eats on display
[21:14:14] <taplar> ok, so then $('#'+ key) would be ('#key1')
[21:14:27] <taplar> $('#seat1')
[21:14:41] <JZA> yeah...
[21:14:48] <taplar> yep, so that's valid
[21:15:00] <JZA> and if I do $('#seat2').removeClass('noseat');  it activates it on the dashboard
[21:15:06] <JZA> but not on the code, not sure whyh
[21:15:20] <JZA> well my idea is that the noseat class gets later defined.
[21:15:25] <taplar> does the element exist on the page?
[21:15:45] <JZA> yes
[21:15:55] <JZA> I just said it worked on the console
[21:16:01] <taplar> console is after the code runs
[21:16:13] <taplar> does it exist at the time you try to look it up
[21:16:43] <JZA> I pulled the getJSON out of the get(..svg..
[21:17:22] <taplar> so it retrieves it and passes it into your callback.  doesn't exist on the page yet
[21:17:25] <JZA> thats what I tried by pulling it out of the getSVG
[21:17:33] <JZA> maybe
[21:17:39] <JZA> not sure how to tell
[21:17:58] <taplar> you can console log the length of a $() to see how many it found
[21:18:35] <taplar> you seem to be uncertain of how to debug these things.  you should give http://fixingthesejquery.com/ a read
[21:18:59] <JZA> I put it like this: https://jsfiddle.net/btqjyqr4/7/
[21:19:39] <taplar> where are you creating the seat elements on the page?
[21:21:29] <taplar> is the top part doing that?
[21:22:25] <JZA> on the SVG?
[21:22:30] <JZA> yeah
[21:22:48] <taplar> so when the top finishes, all the seats with their ids are on the page
[21:22:54] <JZA> yes
[21:23:08] <taplar> ok, so your going to want to do your second part inside that top callback at the bottom
[21:23:21] <JZA> thats how it was originally.
[21:23:24] <taplar> your doing an ajax call which is async, so there is no guarentee that it will finish before your second part runs
[21:23:35] <JZA> getJSON was insidee the get(svg)
[21:23:43] <taplar> right, it should be
[21:24:19] <JZA> ok I undo the move
[21:24:27] <JZA> but still not working
[21:26:03] <JZA> ok I even delete the $.('#'+key')... for  $.('#seat3')...  but didnt work
[21:26:10] <taplar> you got errors on your page.  check your console
[21:26:21] <taplar> uhhh
[21:26:24] <taplar> that's not valid dude
[21:26:29] <taplar> $.(..) isn't a thing
[21:26:38] <taplar> $('#'+ key)
[21:26:47] <JZA> right
[21:26:58] <JZA> yeah I misstype
[21:27:42] <taplar> so looking at your page, do any of them have the noseat class now?
[21:27:51] <JZA> no
[21:28:13] <JZA> they all still have them, if I put that on the console, then it gets removed.
[21:32:12] <JZA> taplar: any idea?
[21:32:22] <taplar> i'm trying to look at it but not sure
[21:34:29] <JZA> thats why I thought on taking it out of the getSVG so it can finalize rendering before initiating the JSON process to remove the classes
[21:34:45] <JZA> my other thing is that because the CSS is after the JS
[21:38:59] <taplar> i'm thinking something with document.body.insertBefore is wrong
[21:40:44] <taplar> and i just noticed that these script tags are outside the head and body tags.  they should really be in one of the two
[21:41:37] <JZA> I moved them inside body, but didnt change.
[21:55:22] <taplar> you have invalid json returning
[21:59:25] <taplar> yep invalid json, and your if() conditional isn't correct
[21:59:29] <JZA> do I, if I did how so that I can get it manually.
[21:59:41] <JZA> umm.. the console gave me no error.
[21:59:49] <JZA> let see.
[22:00:27] <taplar> you should fix the endpoint to return valid json
[22:00:41] <taplar> or contact whom ever is responsible for that
[22:01:02] <JZA> so only one '
[22:01:05] <JZA> '='
[22:01:11] <taplar> no, your checking the key
[22:01:16] <taplar> key is 'seat1'
[22:01:22] <taplar> and such
[22:01:34] <JZA> right.. thats how it should be
[22:01:39] <taplar> lol, no?
[22:01:44] <taplar> val is true/false
[22:02:25] <JZA> so umm.. if that conditional was assigning values I should have got all the seats instead just the few
[22:02:36] <JZA> and I should have got at least a buch liten up.
[22:02:39] <taplar> if ( 'seat1' == true ) is always false
[22:03:01] <taplar> but it's not doing that logic because the json is invalid so it's not going into that callback
[22:03:40] <JZA> ok
[22:03:44] <JZA> I fix the json
[22:03:50] <JZA> hold on let me get it on a validator
[22:04:09] <taplar> what is your backend?
[22:06:31] <JZA> got it.
[22:06:59] <JZA> but still no result.
[22:07:26] <JZA> if(val = true) { $('#'+key).removeClass('noseat'); };
[22:07:31] <taplar> ==
[22:07:46] <JZA> ok
[22:12:16] <JZA> noting yet.
[22:12:28] <taplar> you got blue chairs on your site now
[22:12:29] <JZA> I validated the json.
[22:12:52] <JZA> wow, great..
[22:13:04] <JZA> wow that took a while :D
[22:13:08] <JZA> but it was rewarding
[22:15:14] <taplar> i'm going to hop out for the night, :).  happy coding
