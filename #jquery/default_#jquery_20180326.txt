[08:22:14] <thanzex> Hi ther! how to submit a form after having used preventdefault?
[08:42:56] <AdamPDotty> form.submit();
[08:47:53] <dimi1947> I have 3 inputs(it could be more or less)...and each one has a data-value attribute https://jsfiddle.net/fiddlehunt/0uLyfr1c/14/    could I pass these values to an array?
[09:41:39] <dimi1947> I am using map to gather data attribute value from some inputs but I cannot pass them to an array as I want...https://jsfiddle.net/fiddlehunt/kbf8hhaz/17/
[09:50:51] <AdamPDotty> Not sure, what you want that is not happening.
[10:38:45] <berm> Hello!
[10:39:22] <berm> I have a headache greater than mount everest. It's something awefully simple, but it drives me crazy
[10:39:57] <berm> If someone could spot my mistake, I'd be greatfull
[10:40:47] <berm> https://maze.io/paste/p/qecgwkps1v9kbgbk
[10:41:07] <berm> I want to reach login-form
[10:41:18] <berm> $('document').ready(function () { /* validation */ $("#login-form").validate({}) should be correct, right?
[11:03:59] <abed> i have a row of inputs then id like user to add/delete.. i.e multiple rows or one row
[11:04:11] <abed> what's best way to do this?
[11:04:32] <abed> have jquery just copy the whole <div>
[11:04:35] <abed> ?
[11:10:48] <pavonia> Add or delete what, new input elements?
[11:14:56] <abed> pavonia: a whole <div> with input elements in it
[11:15:48] <pavonia> There are remove() and clone() functions wich might be useful
[11:16:45] <abed> ah ok
[11:32:27] <NoCode> Hello, is there easy tutorial on how to integrate a cookie session into a modal so I can add a popup once while someone is visiting my website?
[11:44:20] <robertmaxrees> NoCode can't think of any tutorials for that, but the premise is pretty simple./
[11:45:03] <NoCode> Found one: https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_cookies.asp JS-Cookie looks alright but I'm not sure on examples.
[11:46:23] <robertmaxrees> are you looking to fire the modal conditionally?
[11:48:04] <NoCode> I just want the modal to show up once in a given timeframe, or until the window is closed. Probably just until it is closed, so it's a little easier.
[11:48:41] <robertmaxrees> that's pretty easy.  where are you getting stuck?
[11:50:15] <NoCode> I'll try this tutorial here and see if works out.
[11:50:49] <robertmaxrees> alright.  i'd highly suggest using js-cookie and not managing them manually fwiw.
[12:14:52] <NoCode> robertmaxrees: https://pastebin.ca/4006829 -- Tried that. Not working. Not sure how to reference both a local library, and external library. The local library already gets used without suggesting a src. But, I think I have to have a source for js-cookie, no?
[12:15:29] <robertmaxrees> you're including it via that script tag.
[12:16:22] <robertmaxrees> are you getting colsole errors?
[12:16:47] <robertmaxrees> also: https://github.com/js-cookie/js-cookie#basic-usage
[12:16:57] <robertmaxrees> doesn't look like they're using the library correctly.
[12:18:27] <NoCode> Not sure of the error, I'm working within a CMS. Allows me to add the code in dialog.
[12:19:32] <robertmaxrees> even better
[12:19:34] <robertmaxrees> make a fiddle :)
[17:07:55] <taplar> too much action in here today
[17:08:13] <grapheti> 2spicy4me
[17:55:03] <abed> taplar: jquery is officially dead
[17:55:11] <abed> react and angular channels are busy
[17:55:13] <NoCode> What's a fiddle?
[17:55:33] <taplar> maybe
[17:55:33] <abed> NoCode: http://jsfiddle.com
[17:56:00] <abed> wait sorry NoCode
[17:56:07] <abed> https://jsfiddle.net/
[17:56:10] <abed> not .com
[17:56:45] <NoCode> ah okay cool
[17:57:02] <grapheti> Look how busy that vue channel is.
[17:57:14] <grapheti> Can't get a word in.
[17:57:43] <taplar> what is the vue room?
[17:57:58] <grapheti> #vuejs
[17:58:14] <robertmaxrees> lol
[17:58:38] <taplar> well it could have been just #vue .  and /list is sooo hard, :D
[17:58:39] <grapheti> trying to find my name
[17:58:41] <grapheti> it's hard man
[17:58:46] <grapheti> kek
[18:00:29] <grapheti> But I do like vue :P
[18:00:50] <taplar> i started to do some vue over the weekend, but then I got sucked into diablo 3
[18:01:06] <grapheti> Yeah, that shit will consume you.
[18:01:09] <grapheti> So understandable.
[18:01:34] <robertmaxrees> sometimes i wish i had time to do that kind of stuff on the weekend.
[18:01:35] <grapheti> http://steamcommunity.com/id/backdatbishop
[18:01:40] <grapheti> I have a few hours on L4D2
[18:01:48] <taplar> also i need to look into modifying my build script to potentially version my css/js files
[18:02:03] <robertmaxrees> taplar for service workers?
[18:02:07] <taplar> yup
[18:02:11] <robertmaxrees> use webpack :)
[18:02:25] <robertmaxrees> there's a webpack plugin for workbox that manages all of that for you.
[18:02:40] <grapheti> Don't listen to this dictator!
[18:03:02] <grapheti> I'm jk, I don't even care.
[18:03:13] <taplar> i'm using webpack, but i'm not very familiar with it.  right now i'm using webpack to compile my vue files.  But some of my css/js files are outside of it as external files that i compile with gulp
[18:03:36] <robertmaxrees> you'll wanna use it to compile everything in one step.
[18:03:44] <robertmaxrees> there are plugins that can help you with everything.
[18:03:49] <robertmaxrees> css and js included.
[18:04:23] <robertmaxrees> then you pipe that stuff through workbox and it pops out the sw file with the caching stuff ready to go.
[18:06:05] <taplar> i'll have to mess around with that
[18:09:01] <grapheti> Fun fact: 2,000 hours is 83 days
[18:09:06] <grapheti> In other words, I have no life.
[18:12:28] <grapheti> haha, vuejs gitter
[18:12:30] <grapheti> >  NO LONGER MAINTAINED: Please migrate to http://chat.vuejs.org/ for the new and improved community chat
[18:12:40] <grapheti> and it's discord
[18:13:43] <robertmaxrees> lol
[18:24:11] <taplar> one of the few apps i've put on my phone
[18:25:21] <grapheti> Discord?
[18:25:32] <taplar> yeah
[18:25:37] <grapheti> nice
[18:25:42] <grapheti> I love discord.
[18:25:49] <grapheti> UI and everything pretty sweet
[18:28:09] <taplar> i wonder if there is a PWA for freenode.
[18:28:14] * taplar grins evily
[18:29:01] <robertmaxrees> hah
[18:29:21] <robertmaxrees> would be killer to queue messages to/from the client.
[18:30:42] <grapheti> window.postMessage()
[18:30:49] <robertmaxrees> sync state and all that.,
[18:32:22] <grapheti> Don't even know why I said that. Been using it recently lol
[18:32:28] <grapheti> headed out
[18:32:30] <grapheti> lata homies
[18:32:39] <taplar> cya
[18:33:20] <taplar> i'm trying to find a video i saw the other day.  iirc, it was some docking station for your phone that would let you use your keyboard, mouse and monitor on your android device
[18:34:45] <taplar> ah, andromium i guess
[18:35:37] <taplar> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6HmZFSPsUE  you see this crap?
[18:36:17] <robertmaxrees> what makes it crap?
[18:36:27] <taplar> crap ~== crazy stuff
[18:36:34] <robertmaxrees> oh hah
[18:37:02] <robertmaxrees> i can almost see this being useful for low-income areas.
[18:37:29] <taplar> lol, it's like the middle ground between a low end laptop and a raspberry pi
[18:42:04] <taplar> but yeah, I may see about writing out gulp and just do webpack.  maybe write some npm scripts to execute it and what not
[18:44:16] <taplar> but it bundles all the js and css into a single file, respectively?
[18:49:56] <robertmaxrees> not necessarily.
[18:49:57] <robertmaxrees> it can.
[18:51:58] <robertmaxrees> usually it creates bundles for each of your pages.
[19:31:23] <tdump> Hello. I ran into a bit of a problem and I was hoping someone could help me out.  I want to select and return a collection of jquery objects.  Iterate through the collection and get an attribute value, then update a text node.  This is what I'm trying and I'm gettin an error that tweet.attr is not a function.  https://gist.github.com/tls11/3870ff36d52e8d9f0d631f59d9b25c86
[19:32:00] <robertmaxrees> tdump easy
[19:32:04] <robertmaxrees> the first arg isn't the element.
[19:32:13] <robertmaxrees> it's the index.
[19:32:22] <robertmaxrees> also: it'd the raw DOM node, not a jquery object.
[19:32:38] <robertmaxrees> you could either due let i = $(this).attr('data-dex')
[19:32:38] <tdump> hmmm
[19:32:47] <robertmaxrees> or .each(function(index, tweet) {
[19:33:00] <robertmaxrees> then do let i = $(tweet).attr('data-dex')
[19:35:05] <tdump> @robertmaxrees Is there a way to get a collection of jquery objects instead of the DOM nodes?  When you said the first arg isn't the element, it's the index what specifically are you referring to (sorry if that's dumb question I'm a little sleep deprived and new to this), and Thank You!!
[19:35:25] <robertmaxrees> .each(function(tweet) {
[19:35:46] <robertmaxrees> that "tweet" is the index
[19:36:00] <robertmaxrees> you have the arguments backwards, basiocally.
[19:36:47] <robertmaxrees> you can either change that function(tweets) the way i mentioned before, or use $(this) instead of tweets.
[19:37:39] <tdump> okay cool
[19:37:44] <robertmaxrees> as for the "collection" question, you have a jquery object already, which is a collection of DOM nodes.  any/all enumeration methods will grab DOM nodes.
[19:37:44] <tdump> thanks again!
[19:37:47] <robertmaxrees> that's how jquery works.
[19:38:52] <tdump> will jquery methods work with the nodes eg node.text()
[19:38:57] <robertmaxrees> no.
[19:39:03] <tdump> that's what I thought
[19:39:05] <robertmaxrees> that's why you still have to wrap them via $()
[19:39:15] <tdump> oh okay!
[19:39:22] <robertmaxrees> you can use native dom properties/methods instead of you want.
[19:39:36] <tdump> I know I said it, but really, thanks for the time!  I really appreciate it.
[19:39:54] <robertmaxrees> definitely
[20:41:04] <jak2000> hi all
[23:14:31] <tdump> Question.  I'm having a tough time with 'this'
[23:15:24] <tdump> hi.  I'm having an issue with this...  I have an object with a bunch of methods I'm using to manipulate a webpage.  Here' my code:  https://gist.github.com/tls11/327f40ff5ccb02156964e086a82ebaec
[23:16:08] <tdump> line 63 there is a method called timeline.  most of it is working how I expected except for 64 and 68.  that is still pointing at the element that triggered the click handler.  How am I supposed to refer back to the instance of my object so I can use the allBtn value?
