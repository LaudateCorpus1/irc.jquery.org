[14:39:25] <destramic> how can you execute such code with js please? https://pastebin.com/qwSXEqBX
[14:49:14] <destramic> some smart bastard must know how :)
[14:49:47] <destramic> i need it for this script im making https://pastebin.com/mkMDqbDq
[14:50:37] <destramic> automatically loads styles scripts and plugins to element, early days yet though as i only started writing it late last night
[15:08:18] <bjarne333> destramic: {'whaaaay!'}
[15:08:29] <bjarne333> I dont think thats valid js
[15:08:44] <destramic> haha
[15:08:48] <destramic> its an example
[15:08:56] <destramic> put i want to load a plugin from a var
[15:10:23] <bjarne333> i dont understand the problem
[15:10:33] <bjarne333> perhaps a smaller code example?
[15:11:35] <destramic> https://pastebin.com/qwSXEqBX   this is the example
[15:11:54] <destramic> select is .button plugin is called ping and options
[15:12:02] <destramic> i want to combine to run plugin ive made
[15:19:16] <bjarne333> what do you want to combine?
[15:21:35] <destramic> if you cant read what im tring to do in 4 lines then i dont think i can explain it sorry
[15:22:07] <bjarne333> alright cool.
[15:22:28] <bjarne333> i dont really know jquery but im an experienced javascript developer
[15:23:58] <destramic> button is $('.button'), plugin name is ping ... how can i call plugin from button.plugin_name(plugin_options);

[15:26:08] <destramic> https://pastebin.com/fkzm1phP
[15:26:51] <bjarne333> i dont understand you mate
[15:27:28] <bjarne333> you are calling plugin_name with that function is never defined...
[15:29:41] <bjarne333> are you trying to call a function by string?
[15:30:01] <bjarne333> e.g. var f='fook' and you want code to run $.fook?
[15:30:39] <destramic> trying to call $('.button').ping({});
[15:31:30] <bjarne333> you have not defined the ping function
[15:32:08] <Hoppelhase> I don't understand the question either
[15:35:07] <destramic> https://pastebin.com/mn3VbHuw
[15:35:16] <destramic> im sure its do able
[15:38:19] <Hoppelhase> selector["plugin_name"](...)
[15:40:44] <Hoppelhase> Err, scratch the quotes
[16:31:29] <destramic> Hoppelhase ill give it a try thank you sir
[17:51:16] <amperry> Hi folks, I'm having trouble getting something to hide on load and display when a selector is chosen. It's in a rails template, but I'm pretty sure my error or misunderstanding is in the jquery part. Code here: https://gist.github.com/amp108/2ba124c154e74fc41088fe610ba18cc6.
[18:09:43] <Hoppelhase> amperry: You are opening a <span> but closing a <div>. Also I'm not sure if you even can have such elements around <tr> elements
[18:10:19] <Hoppelhase> So the id and style should probably go directly on the <tr>
[18:11:37] <amperry> Hoppelhase: thanks for catching that. I tried with both div and span just for the hell it, but correcting that didn't change things. I'll try putting the id and style on the <tr>.
[18:13:28] <amperry> Hoppelhase: that did it. You're a lifesaver.
[18:13:39] <Hoppelhase> :)
