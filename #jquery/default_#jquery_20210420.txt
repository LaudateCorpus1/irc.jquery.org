[02:12:42] <Absolum> finally got a working demo in the rough. It basically creates an interface that allows you to use common sense alignment strategies. proxy1.TL=proxy3.TR would set the TL coordinate of the element in proxy1 to the top right coordinate of proxy3's source.
[02:15:01] <robertmaxrees> cool.
[02:15:08] <robertmaxrees> glad you got a start of a PoC :)
[02:19:04] <Absolum> It completely changed the conversation from "I don't know what you are talking about" to "OH, I get it--is that how alignment always works?" These are brilliant people so I knew it was my inability to communicate the concept accurately. Now they are considering using it for a series of plugins for Illustrator!  Thanks for all of your help to get here (and for your patience).

[06:21:34] <Rhino13> I'm totally new to jqeury
[07:37:23] <Cork> Rhino13: if you want help with code don't leave php code in the scripts, it makes them useless
[07:39:07] <Rhino13> Cork: ok can do that any idea on how to solve my problem
[07:40:02] <Cork> not sure what the code does as there isn't much useful infor in the jsfiddle
[07:41:03] <Rhino13> ok it should be a select2 field
[07:41:56] <Rhino13> I can get it to work as a select to field but have problem with the jQuery part, to pull the data from the selected as selected
[07:42:08] <Rhino13> hope this makes sence
