[00:25:13] <Ou42> jquery mobile question. I'd like to have 3 divs inlined so that when in landscape mode they are side by side, but then reflow vertically when in portrait mode...
[00:26:10] <Ou42> jquery mobile layout continued... so, I finally have the start of it, but the 2nd div is aligning with the bottom of the first div. how do I get them to align at the top?
[00:32:45] <Ou42> anybody?
[00:39:47] <Ou42> how about...
[00:40:08] <Ou42> unequal column layout? can the grid column sizes be changed so they are not all uniform?
[00:40:20] <Ou42> jquery mobile
[00:45:25] <hailhydra> is this the best place to ask bootstrap questions?
[00:49:04] <Ou42> I got here more than 10 min ago for a jqm q. no response.
[00:49:17] <Ou42> even if I could, why would i want to help hydra?
[00:50:16] <Uhkis> because that's what this channel is all about?
[00:50:29] <Ou42> helping hydra?!
[00:51:15] <Uhkis> yes, jquery is a subdivision of hydra
[00:51:28] <Uhkis> oh wait, i didn't just say that
[00:51:34] <hailhydra> I hang out in #django all day. We help everyone
[00:52:14] <hailhydra> So I can't figure out how to write some HTML for the "body" of a bootstrap popover.
[00:52:44] <Uhkis> hailhydra: i think (and hope) this was a joke about your nickname being an evil organization greeting
[00:52:52] <hailhydra> I tried data-html, data-template and just data.
[00:54:03] <hailhydra> Uhkis, I used to work for a company called Hydra IDM ... before avengers. It was a work joke and then I learned later the guy who made it up was a huge comic book nerd.
[00:54:26] <Ou42> he's just saying that. how could we possibly prove any of that.
[00:54:29] <Ou42> he's a hydra spy!
[00:54:46] <hailhydra> you can't
[00:54:54] <Ou42> :p
[00:54:58] <hailhydra> I assumed you would assume that so here I am
[00:55:12] <Ou42> i do like the fact that while Uhkis helps you out, he'll be hailing the whole time.
[00:55:14] <hailhydra> I'm a double-reverse spy
[00:55:28] * Ou42 hands mic back to Uhkis
[00:55:29] <hailhydra> *thats the joke
[00:55:59] <Uhkis> hailhydra: it seems to me that it only allows plain text
[00:56:02] <hailhydra> As long as you refrain from giving a Nazi salute before you type
[00:56:28] <hailhydra> k so back to bootstrap's wonderfull popover plugin...
[00:56:51] <Uhkis> hailhydra: using options object with content might work with html
[00:57:11] <Uhkis> there's html flag
[00:57:27] <Uhkis> http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#popovers-usage
[00:58:46] <hailhydra> I tried data-html
[01:00:08] <Uhkis> hailhydra: http://jsfiddle.net/50m7zfd5/ seems to work with that too
[01:01:13] <hailhydra> Uhkis, strange. I wonder why it doesn't work for me
[01:01:55] <hailhydra> the only thing I am doing different is I am writting all the popover attributes with a jQuery $.attr() before I instantiate it
[01:02:18] <Uhkis> yeah, use the options object instead
[01:03:59] <hailhydra> ah do I have to set data-html to true? in order for it to render safely?
[01:04:24] <Uhkis> more like unsafely, but seems so
[01:05:14] <hailhydra> ah that was it
[01:05:24] <hailhydra> I didn't have data-html set to true
[01:07:52] <hailhydra> I bet it would be fun to work for bootstrap/twitter. You would hear things like "We need to write another BS method for that..."
[01:10:40] <Uhkis> also things like "are we going under?" :D
[01:41:33] <Ou42> I don't suppose either of you are pretty good with jquery mobile?
[01:41:44] <Ou42> wow 31 minutes later, he asked.
[01:42:16] <Uhkis> sorry, never even tried it
[01:42:47] <Ou42> since you're still here...
[01:43:12] <Ou42> are inline-block div's ... supposedly horizontally arranged... like columns, right?
[01:43:36] <Uhkis> normally, yes
[01:44:03] <Ou42> ok what's the property/attribute/setting to get the divs to align at the top not the bottom?
[01:44:20] <Cork> vertical-align: top
[01:44:44] <Ou42> if that works... brb
[01:46:18] <Ou42> *cries*
[01:46:21] <Ou42> oops
[01:46:24] * Ou42 cries
[01:46:37] <Ou42> it's so so beautiful.
[01:48:05] <Ou42> follow-up q. using 'data-inline="true"' but only 2 of the 3 div's are going inline
[01:48:05] <MAxou> Morning, Do you think I can use thise jquery plugin https://github.com/oriongunning/gridder-ajax in my website www.kurtis-immo.fr to open a bigger area with detail property when someone click on photo ?
[01:55:19] <Ou42> i put "float: left;" back in and the button that was under the 3rd div got put above... interesting
[01:59:16] <Ou42> MAxou: I think you'll have to ask a bit differently. There are only a few gurus here and I'm not one of them. :p
[01:59:46] <Viliasas> Hello, maybe someone could tell me why could jQuery UI Autocomplete component instead of showing a normal select list, is showing "ui-helper-hidden-accessible" message and allowing me to use keyboard to switch through results in the input field. Is there a way to disable this functionality?
[01:59:59] <Cork> MAxou: try it and see is what my recommendation would be
[02:00:52] <Cork> Viliasas: the accessible helper is always there
[02:00:59] <Cork> it shouldn't be visible though
[02:01:15] <Cork> make sure you've loaded the css for the package
[02:02:42] <Viliasas> Cork: Well if I itentionaly find the Autocomplete list in the DOM and unhide it, it looks correct. My problem is that it's not shown automatically.
[02:03:11] <Cork> Viliasas: use the dom inspector to see what rule is hiding it
[02:05:07] <Viliasas> Cork: Thanks for the idea. I've looked at it and it seems that it's hidden by inline style - so this is a default behaviour. But top coordinate is way off... I imagine that it is shown, but somewhere where it can't be seen
[02:05:12] <Ou42> gots to go. thanks for the help Cork
[02:05:56] <Cork> Viliasas: well i've never seen the problem you're describing, and i'm using autocomplete a lot
[02:06:31] <Cork> Viliasas: if you could provide a link that shows the problem (a jsfiddle testcase if possible) would help a lot
[02:06:42] <Viliasas> Cork: :) I'm using it on dynamically loaded block list, so I imagine that it gets its position wrong
[02:06:55] <Cork> Viliasas: no
[02:07:30] <Cork> jquery ui sets fairly few css rules inline (as it should be) so it has quite few of those problem
[02:09:14] <Viliasas> Cork: It would be very difficult for me to show it to you somehow... At this point I think that it's positioning problem due to inline style: top: -5663.25px;
[02:12:27] <Viliasas> Cork: and it has position: relative; for some reason
[02:41:11] <km4> hi
[02:49:17] <Anniepoo> addClass isn't working with an SVG g element
[02:49:23] <Anniepoo> (for me)
[02:49:40] <Anniepoo>     var g = $("#svgcontainer svg .el-rubberband-layer").filter('[action="' + this.actionName + '"]');
[02:49:40] <Anniepoo>     if( show)
[02:49:40] <Anniepoo>         g.addClass("el-in-use");
[02:50:11] <Uhkis> dont paste code to channel please.
[02:50:28] <Anniepoo> ok, hang on, will pastebin
[02:50:35] <Cork> Anniepoo: also svg isn't in the same document
[02:51:03] <Cork> so you need to use .contents()
[02:51:15] <Anniepoo> it wasn't remotely loaded
[02:51:22] <Anniepoo> http://pastebin.com/iaqDHfFb
[02:51:24] <Cork> svg is still a separate document
[02:51:44] <Anniepoo> ok - strange part is , the g is being found
[02:51:46] <Cork> cause it can't be part of html as it is an incompatible spec
[02:51:57] <Cork> Anniepoo: make a jsfiddle
[02:52:37] <Anniepoo> that could be a lot of code
[02:52:58] <Cork> well reproduce the problem
[02:53:07] <Cork> doesn't have to be the exact same
[02:55:57] <Anniepoo> ok
[02:56:55] <yuciyuar> hi. how can i lowercase a href link?
[02:57:32] <Cork> youngnico: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/toLowerCase
[03:01:21] <Anniepoo> http://jsfiddle.net/h23ea0b7/
[03:01:40] <Anniepoo> ok, it should be displaying a small black rect
[03:02:48] <yuciyuar> how can i make lowercase a href links?
[03:13:26] <Anniepoo> http://jsfiddle.net/h23ea0b7/3/
[03:18:02] <Cork> youngnico: i just answered that...
[03:21:57] <Cork> Anniepoo: <div id="#svgcontainer"> <--
[03:22:12] <Cork> so the selector would have to be $('#\#svgcontainer')
[03:22:27] <Anniepoo> tahnks
[03:23:49] <Anniepoo> http://jsfiddle.net/h23ea0b7/4/
[03:24:00] <Anniepoo> thats just a mistake copying to jsfiddle
[03:24:14] <Anniepoo> not the real probelm
[03:24:15] <hellyeah> this channel has logs?
[03:24:19] <hellyeah> hmm
[03:24:21] <hellyeah> Ä±os
[03:24:22] <hellyeah> ops
[03:24:23] <hellyeah> sorry
[03:24:55] <Cork> Anniepoo: i'm looking into the rest right now
[03:25:02] <Anniepoo> thanks!
[03:25:40] <Anniepoo> it's odd - I'm writing an online CAD system, it's a maze of selectors reaching into svg, I've not had issues b efore
[03:27:03] <Anniepoo> using the debugger to manually add el-in-use does make it appear
[03:27:11] <Anniepoo> and the debugger says it's not added
[03:27:50] <hellyeah> there is no log in #jquery
[03:27:58] <hellyeah> it is empty page
[03:28:19] <Uhkis> http://irc.jquery.org/%23jquery/
[03:28:37] <Anniepoo> $("#bar").addClass("el-in-use");  <-- just a debug attempt
[03:29:52] <hellyeah> Uhkis:
[03:30:02] <hellyeah> when you click from the page
[03:30:10] <hellyeah> it directed me to emty page
[03:30:24] <hellyeah> http://irc.jquery.org/
[03:31:36] <hellyeah> i just let you know thank you
[03:35:05] <Anniepoo> http://jsfiddle.net/h23ea0b7/6/
[03:35:15] <Anniepoo> cork - seems to be something odd in addClass
[03:35:33] <Anniepoo> using attr it appears
[03:35:41] <Anniepoo> @Cork
[03:35:44] <Cork> Anniepoo: the problem is in the dom
[03:35:53] <Cork> className doesn't accept the new values
[03:36:16] <Anniepoo> hmm....
[03:38:16] <Anniepoo> https://github.com/JeremiePat/SVG-DOM-helpers/wiki/SVGElement.addClass
[03:41:01] <Cork> Anniepoo: sorry for going away a bit there
[03:41:07] <Cork> had to deal with something
[03:41:14] <Anniepoo> thanks Cork - would have taken me a while to convince myself that it wasn't my issue
[03:41:38] <Cork> Anniepoo: the problem is what jquery does is basically elm.className.split(' ')
[03:42:01] <Cork> then it adds the new class if it isn't already in there
[03:42:11] <Cork> and then elm.className = arr.join(' ')
[03:42:18] <Anniepoo> right
[03:42:29] <Anniepoo> and elm.className is read-only
[03:42:31] <Cork> i tried to simulate this by doing g[0].className = 'something'
[03:42:33] <Cork> ya
[03:42:42] <Anniepoo> ok, so why does my workaround work?
[03:42:43] <Cork> same for classList it looks like
[03:43:05] <Cork> what was the workaround (didn't get to looking for one)
[03:43:20] <Anniepoo> and the github is substantially same, looks like
[03:43:21] <Anniepoo> http://jsfiddle.net/h23ea0b7/6/
[03:43:34] <Anniepoo> I just used attr to set the whole thing
[03:43:37] <Cork> hmm
[03:43:40] <Cork> interesting
[03:43:47] <Cork> so it uses setAttribute('class')
[03:44:10] <Cork> Anniepoo: addClass uses the property className
[03:44:19] <Anniepoo> yup
[03:44:21] <Cork> attr uses setAttribute('class', new-value)
[03:44:31] <Cork> i would be a bit careful with that
[03:44:46] <Cork> attributes aren't guaranteed to actually modify the dom
[03:45:02] <Anniepoo> hmmm
[03:45:05] <Cork> as we... they are the attributes of the original document, not the dom property
[03:47:03] <Cork> Anniepoo: a safer solution http://jsfiddle.net/h23ea0b7/7/
[03:47:08] <jop008> if I use $.each(obj, function (index, rec) { how can I refer to otuside varaibles?
[03:47:21] <Cork> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/DOMTokenList
[03:47:37] <jop008> within the routine I have this scope
[03:47:42] <Anniepoo> http://jsfiddle.net/h23ea0b7/9/
[03:47:47] <Cork> jop008: just like normal, for everything except this
[03:47:59] <Omar---> hi
[03:48:00] <Cork> Anniepoo: use 7
[03:48:29] <Anniepoo> ok, thanks
[03:48:55] <Omar---> is bootstrap enough to create a responsive website or I need extra stuff?
[03:48:56] <Cork> Anniepoo: actually, give me a min
[03:49:28] <Anniepoo> ok
[03:49:38] <Cork> heh
[03:50:03] <Cork> Anniepoo: i thought it might work with addClass in 2.x or 3.x as those doesn't have the old ie support (where classList isn't supported)
[03:50:09] <Cork> but nope
[03:50:14] <jop008> here my code
[03:50:16] <Anniepoo> 8c/
[03:50:17] <Cork> so prop('classList') is the best solution
[03:50:20] <jop008> paretn is undefined
[03:50:24] <jop008> in $.each
[03:50:50] <jop008> I want to process the obj resultset of the server
[03:50:52] <Anniepoo> nice.
[03:50:59] <Anniepoo> thanks for the help!
[03:51:04] <Cork> jop008: you forgot to share the link
[03:51:08] <Cork> Anniepoo: np
[03:51:13] <jop008> http://pastebin.com/fke5AU0y
[03:52:12] <Cork> ah
[03:52:35] <Cork> jop008: let me guess this is in v8?
[03:52:53] <Cork> it has a known problem where they release arguments too early
[03:52:58] <jop008> v8?
[03:53:13] <Cork> the javascript engine in chrome/chromium based browsers
[03:53:28] <Cork> try doing something like var obj = obj;
[03:53:41] <Cork> first thing in the .done callback
[03:53:47] <Anniepoo> nice!
[03:54:30] <jop008> I  made it a for loop much more reliable
[03:55:23] <Cork> jop008: if the obj is an array, yes
[03:55:35] <Cork> if it isn't then be careful so you don't loop random properties
[03:55:38] <jop008> obj is an array
[03:55:49] <Cork> might want to change the name then :)
[03:56:49] <BarnaSzalai> hi
[03:58:34] <Uhkis> Cork: release arguments too early? as in mid function run?!
[03:59:01] <Cork> Uhkis: well between function and child functions
[03:59:08] <Cork> mostly async child functions
[03:59:32] <Cork> .done(function(data) { setTimeout(function() { data == undefined }); });
[03:59:45] <Cork> .done(function(data) { var data=data; setTimeout(function() { data == defined }); });
[04:00:36] <Cork> it is memory optimizations so the engine doesn't realize the name is still used and throws away the data
[04:03:57] <abs25> hello
[04:04:21] <abs25> can anyone help me conver this ajax in jquery style ajax? http://pastebin.com/E6bEvzA3 I managed to get request to work, but I need to add event listeners
[04:05:25] <hellyeah> i am using aimate() when you click the button you will see div is enlarged. And you will see arrow button is changed. When i click again i want to get first appearence of div how can i do that? https://jsfiddle.net/2omfq5xj/147/ Do i need to use css transition?
[04:05:44] <Cork> abs25: the event listeners would be the done/fail callbacks
[04:06:01] <abs25> Cork: what about progress of upload?
[04:07:09] <Cork> abs25: there isn't a progress option as far as i know
[04:07:30] <abs25> Cork: so I cant make uploader with progress bar with jquery ajax?
[04:07:42] <Cork> you can
[04:07:49] <abs25> how?
[04:08:05] <Cork> though you have to either access the real xhr object and attach the progress event
[04:08:10] <Cork> or use a plugin that exposes it
[04:08:35] <abs25> if I acces rela xhr object it wont work in IE right?
[04:08:43] <Cork> ya
[04:08:51] <abs25> how to handle that issue?
[04:08:52] <Cork> well older ie
[04:09:01] <abs25> I wanted to avoid it by using jquery lol
[04:09:06] <Cork> well if the event doesn't fire there isn't much you can do
[04:09:10] <hellyeah> 1.9.1
[04:09:18] <Cork> you can add an event listener, but older ie won't fire it
[04:09:22] <hellyeah> i.e. sucks
[04:09:37] <hellyeah> what about attachevent or smt like that
[04:09:41] <Cork> abs25: here is an example http://www.dave-bond.com/blog/2010/01/JQuery-ajax-progress-HMTL5/
[04:09:47] <Cork> (scroll to the bottom)
[04:09:57] <hellyeah> i have read older i.e. has attackevent instead of addeventlistener
[04:10:22] <Cork> hellyeah: uh, ya, it used there own dom api for ages
[04:10:41] <Cork> this is why ppl talk about a pre and post ie9
[04:10:42] <hellyeah> hmm i.e. 7-8 use this iirc
[04:10:52] <Cork> no ie 3-8
[04:11:03] <hellyeah> hmm
[04:11:05] <abs25> Cork: so using jequry over pure JS wont do much when it comes to compatibility?
[04:11:15] <abs25> like there is no advantege in converting that code I showed?
[04:11:19] <Cork> abs25: well it will
[04:11:29] <Cork> abs25: but it can't fake info the browser doesn't provide
[04:12:03] <abs25> how will it help though? ignoring old IE browser I wont show bar there
[04:12:35] <Cork> well for one it helps handle the differences in how the xhr object work
[04:12:48] <Cork> though ya, jquery doesn't help with the stupid XDomain object ie uses
[04:13:12] <abs25> so there still will be benefit?
[04:13:35] <hellyeah> abs25: i think you should write different js for i.e.
[04:13:43] <Cork> uh, no
[04:13:51] <hellyeah> and you can seperate in head section
[04:13:53] <hellyeah> hmm
[04:14:06] <hellyeah> i saw something like that once
[04:14:10] <Cork> abs25: if you talk specifically about moving from using xhr to $.ajax, it might not be worth it
[04:14:31] <Cork> abs25: for event handling then ya, it is definitely worth it
[04:15:21] <abs25> Cork: thanks for a wonderufll explanation
[04:15:26] <abs25> amazing help :)
[04:15:31] <Cork> also jquery contains workarounds for browser bugs
[04:15:40] <Cork> it has a lot of fixes for chrome bugs too
[04:15:54] <Cork> so the end result is actually that you get a more stable end product
[04:16:03] <abs25> I know thats why I really want to make this work
[04:16:21] <Cork> personally i would actually go with the xhr: function() {}
[04:16:23] <Cork> solution
[04:16:28] <abs25> but evene xample u sent, it says cannot read property addEventListener of undefined
[04:16:40] <Cork> hmm
[04:17:28] <abs25> let me give it another try
[04:23:23] <hellyeah> hey
[04:23:40] <hellyeah> i want to console width opf each button what is my mistake here pls help http://jsfiddle.net/2omfq5xj/155/
[04:24:32] <Cork> abs25: http://jsfiddle.net/b65n8Lh0/1/
[04:25:15] <hellyeah> pls somee help
[04:27:04] <hellyeah> damn
[04:29:33] <hellyeah> why it returned NaN http://jsfiddle.net/2omfq5xj/162/
[04:30:23] <Cork> abs25: i spoke too soon, there is a .progress(func) handler in jquery
[04:30:36] <Cork> not sure it works as you want though, but you can  give it a try
[04:33:19] <Cork> hellyeah: cause undefined + 10 == NaN
[04:33:21] <abs25> Cork: how cant I find progress example nowhere
[04:34:33] <Cork> abs25: http://api.jquery.com/deferred.progress/
[04:34:40] <hellyeah> Cork: but element is not null http://jsfiddle.net/2omfq5xj/166/
[04:34:48] <Cork> yes it is
[04:34:55] <Cork> you define $width on each loop
[04:34:59] <abs25> Cork: http://pastebin.com/3bEh8RgG like this?
[04:35:18] <Cork> and then  you set <new variable> = <new variable (undefined)> + width()
[04:35:31] <Cork> abs25: yes
[04:36:03] <Cork> abs25: i'm looking in the source right now to see if that handler is actually hooked up
[04:36:45] <abs25>  Cork thanks alot for this, I really need to get this done, its driving me crazy haha
[04:38:07] <Cork> bah...
[04:38:09] <Cork> no it isn't :/
[04:38:19] <Cork> abs25: so barking up the wrong tree
[04:38:33] <Cork> progress is part of deferred, but not used by ajax
[04:38:47] <abs25> damn
[04:38:56] <Cork> ya, kinda silly
[04:39:14] <Cork> might be cause it is used for progressing in $.when
[04:39:19] <abs25> so I should go the way from that post u sent me?
[04:39:24] <Cork> ya
[04:39:31] <Cork> it is the only way i see working
[04:39:45] <Cork> sadly i don't think that example work in older ie
[04:39:57] <abs25> Il handle old ie its not an issue
[04:40:15] <abs25> I just basic example of it working in new browsers
[04:40:21] <Cork> abs25: ya, but the more i look at it the less i think this is a good idea
[04:40:29] <Cork> i would prob just use straight xmlhttprequest
[04:40:38] <Cork> it is too much of a hack to get it working in $.ajax
[04:40:53] <abs25> yeah seems so
[04:41:02] <abs25> I hope I wont regret this haha
[04:41:11] <abs25> Cork: are u like jquery developer
[04:41:20] <Cork> no
[04:41:40] <abs25> how did u check source soo fast haha
[04:41:50] <Cork> btw oh
[04:41:54] <Cork> https://github.com/englercj/jquery-ajax-progress
[04:42:03] <Cork> this looks EXACTLY like what you want
[04:42:12] <Cork> and it does basically the same thing but cleaner
[04:42:19] <Cork> https://github.com/englercj/jquery-ajax-progress/blob/master/js/jquery.ajax-progress.js
[04:42:25] <abs25> oh
[04:42:27] <abs25> wow
[04:42:32] <Cork> about the code => http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.11.2.js
[04:42:59] <Cork> i actually quite like that code up there
[04:48:24] <abs25> Cork: I cant make it POST type for some reason, or I am adding parameters in a wrong way
[04:48:47] <Cork> abs25: type: 'post', should do that
[04:48:51] <Cork> (not method)
[04:50:05] <hailhydra> I need some grunt help
[04:50:48] <hailhydra> I want grunt to watch my JS files and CSS files. Do I make 2 watch  "objects" in my config?
[04:51:39] <abs25> Cork: in the notes : this will not work using the file:// protocol
[04:52:01] <Cork> abs25: you normally can't access file://
[04:52:10] <Cork> especially upload
[04:52:20] <abs25> uh oh, I am trying to do file upload lol
[04:52:30] <Cork> well webpages don't have file access
[04:52:48] <Cork> what you can do is convert the content to a data blob
[04:52:56] <Cork> put that blob into a <a> tag
[04:53:03] <Cork> and have the user click that to store the file
[05:05:03] <Omar---> hi
[05:05:43] <Omar---> https://r-rwebdesign.com/seo-fundamentals rule#1 means ajax/php content?
[05:05:48] <Omar---> I dont understand that
[05:07:33] <xec> maybe what they mean generated content in another sense, like some random text and keywords to try to get more matches with google searches (as opposed to actual content)
[05:08:48] <Omar---> oh ok
[05:08:51] <Omar---> thanks xec :)
[05:27:37] <sweet2k4> guys i have a question. i have a login.php file were i include a header and footer php where css and javascript is loaded. But i want to add aditional javascript in the login.php file. is there anyway to load the js in the login.php after the footer jquery has loaded?
[05:27:46] <sweet2k4> could async be a solution?
[05:35:06] <Pazician> Does anyone know something about JSON and Google Map API? I'm struggling to make this work: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28606149/load-data-from-json-file-into-map-markers-in-google-maps
[05:39:07] <Cork> sweet2k4: you could try using getScript inside the callback that loads the footer
[05:39:17] <Cork> but no you can't do this inside the html for an earlier request
[05:39:43] <Cork> sweet2k4: what you could do is define a global function
[05:39:56] <Cork> and have the ajax call that loads the footer call that when it is done
[05:40:13] <Cork> a bit messy but it should work
[05:54:16] <sweet2k4> Cork: thanks for the suggestion, il take a look at that, first im going to try something else
[06:23:35] <Omar---> can anyone guide me on how to create friendly urls?
[06:23:49] <Cork> O_o
[06:23:54] <Cork> "how to create"?
[06:24:01] <Omar---> hi Cork
[06:24:04] <Omar---> generate
[06:24:12] <Cork> Omar---: that would depend on the server code your using
[06:24:25] <Cork> and i would recommend asking in a related channel to that
[06:25:37] <Omar---> Cork: i've been reading on this subject but got lost to be honest
[06:25:43] <Omar---> which channel do you recommend?
[06:25:59] <Cork> a channel related to the framework your using server side
[06:26:10] <Cork> you asking in a javascript channel, and it is completely off topic here
[06:26:23] <Cork> unless you use node.js server side that is
[06:26:37] <Cork> (i would still recommend asking in there channels in that case)
[06:43:19] <Omar---> sorry I was afk
[06:43:34] <Omar---> Cork: apache/php I assume
[06:44:11] <xec> Omar---: if you're doing a single page application, then you can look into client-side routing, like sammy.js
[06:44:38] <xec> Omar---: still #jquery isn't really relevant
[06:47:39] <Omar---> xec I know, the problem is i'm not developer and I dont know from where to start
[06:47:52] <Omar---> that's why I ask you guys
[06:48:01] <Omar---> all I need is a hint
[06:48:16] <Cork> Omar---: for the third time, this is the wrong channel for the question
[06:48:37] <Cork> ask in a channel about the server code your running, where it is ON topic
[06:48:38] <Omar---> Cork I know
[06:48:44] <Omar---> thanks anyway
[06:55:54] <hellyeah> yo
[06:57:00] <hellyeah> just wondering how can i do second animation to the div. When you click image it is expanded. But when you click again i want to see first appearence of div. Should i use css transition? http://jsfiddle.net/2omfq5xj/186/
[07:08:20] <Stummi> Is there a way to do an ajax request and provide a (browsers) download dialog for the reply? I need to start a download from a POST to a URL with payload which is not formdata
[07:16:41] <Cork> Stummi: yes, but not recommended
[07:17:02] <Cork> Stummi: you would have to pull down the content into a Blob
[07:17:04] <Pazician> Why doesn't my JSON file load but the variable does work, the thing is, the whole thing is working just fine but I can't load the file: https://jsfiddle.net/oueh358a/
[07:17:26] <Cork> Stummi: then convert the blob into a data url and then present that url to the user
[07:17:36] <Cork> then the user can click that link and save the data
[07:17:44] <Uhkis> wow, dejavu
[07:18:25] <Stummi> Cork, got it, I should rather just change it on the server side ;)
[07:19:17] <Cork> Stummi: the recommended solution is to have the security server side (based on there session or a long one time password or something)
[07:19:35] <Cork> and then just do use the url in window.location = downloadUrl
[07:19:38] <Cork> or something like that
[07:19:49] <taplar> Pazician: small thing, you should really pull that closure definition out of the for loop.  your redefining it for each iteration
[07:20:11] <Cork> the Blob solution best for when the content is generated in js, not server side
[07:21:02] <Cork> taplar: well the marker is unique for each iteration
[07:21:19] <taplar> he's passing those in with the iife
[07:21:39] <Cork> ya?
[07:21:53] <hellyeah> just wondering how can i do second animation to the div. When you click image it is expanded. But when you click again i want to see first appearence of div. Should i use css transition? http://jsfiddle.net/2omfq5xj/186/
[07:22:07] <Cork> if you mean define the function outside as a named function instead
[07:22:08] <taplar> so its not like the definition is changing
[07:22:14] <Cork> that doesn't make too much difference
[07:22:18] <Cork> jit will take care of that
[07:33:36] <jedrek> Hi. I have a <div> I'm filling out with a user's input. It has a restricted with and word-wraps. Is there an easy way for me to get info about how the words have been split?
[07:34:13] <slax0r> not really, or not that I know of
[07:35:07] <jedrek> it's super hard to google for, all I get is info about how to disable/enable word wrap on divs
[07:37:10] <hellyeah> taplar: can i ask something
[07:37:21] <taplar> sure
[07:37:53] <slax0r> jedrek: https://github.com/xdamman/js-line-wrap-detector maybe?
[07:41:55] <hellyeah> taplar: button click enlarge the div but when i click again i want to narrow it. Is it possible to do that with jquery or do i need to use css transition? http://jsfiddle.net/2omfq5xj/202/
[07:43:05] <taplar> doesn't look like your undoing your animate
[07:43:31] <Cork> to answer the question, doing it in css is the better hoice
[07:43:33] <Cork> *choice
[07:43:48] <taplar> ^
[07:44:30] <Cork> cause js will depend on the main thread in the browser never to be busy more then ~10 ms
[07:44:41] <Cork> it also isn't gpu accelerated
[07:44:54] <Cork> while css runs on a separate rendering thread
[07:44:57] <Cork> and is gpu accelerated
[07:45:10] <jedrek> slax0r: +1
[07:45:13] <jedrek> slax0r: that is perfect
[07:47:18] <hellyeah> taplar: yeah i didnt undo animation
[07:47:28] <hellyeah> is there a way to do that with jquery?_
[07:49:21] <hellyeah> ah
[07:49:29] <hellyeah> there is slideToggle() method
[07:49:49] <taplar> i'm trying to get the css animate working.  i don't quite have it yet.  thought i was missing the prefix for moz but that's not it
[07:54:28] <taplar> crap, i was thinking of transition
[07:54:54] <taplar> yeaaah
[07:55:44] <hellyeah> transition is on my mind
[07:55:49] <hellyeah> i just want to make sure
[07:58:12] <taplar> http://jsfiddle.net/2omfq5xj/206/
[08:00:44] <hellyeah> brb
[08:00:56] <suexec> I have a disabled <select> . I've attached a dblclick function to it. Can I detect *which* element in the disabled list was clicked?
[08:01:19] <hellyeah> you just add transition: witdth: 2s;
[08:01:20] <taplar> does the event fire?
[08:01:37] <robhol> suexec: why on earth do you even expect an event from a disabled list? it's... disabled D:
[08:02:26] <robhol> I can tell you right now that that probably sucks from a UI perspective, even if you might be able to do it
[08:02:31] <suexec> robhol, I have one element that appends <option<'s to the list .. but I want to be able to remove them by double clicking on them, in the list. No need for highlighting etc though.
[08:02:42] <Xatenev> suexec: so why do u disable it
[08:02:46] <Xatenev> suexec: if ur actively using it
[08:02:50] <taplar> i'm still unsure if it will fire the event
[08:02:50] <robhol> Then you're abusing the list and should do something else
[08:03:49] <taplar> some form of a <ul> might be better
[08:03:59] <taplar> if your only displaying
[08:04:54] <suexec> I would prefer it to be in some list that gets sent with a forum submit
[08:05:10] <taplar> a disabled select wouldn't be sent either
[08:05:12] <suexec> and you were right. dblclick did nothing for a <select
[08:05:18] <suexec> (I enabled it)
[08:05:39] <taplar> you can use a <ul> and store the actual data in hidden input fields for the form submission
[08:08:41] <suexec> nvm - I managed. Enabled it and now it works fine :)
[08:08:52] <suexec> event.target.remove got the correct element for me
[08:23:58] <voiter> is there a out-of-the-box solution to highlight a link (<a>) the name of which is hashtagged (in url: #foobar)?
[08:25:28] <xec-> voiter: no, but it should be relatively simple to roll your own
[08:26:05] <xec> voiter: you can access the current hash through location.hash and create a selector based on that
[08:26:16] <voiter> xec, ok, thanks.
[08:26:52] <xec> you can, however, target the element with the matching ID using css ":target" though
[08:28:00] <xec> voiter: there's also a hashchange event
[08:28:38] <voiter> xec, what do you mean by "matching ID". do you mean the css selector by that?
[08:30:14] <xec> voiter: let's say the current url is something#myhash -- then you can style, say <div id="myhash"> by using the css ":target { color: red; }"
[08:31:11] <voiter> xec, i understand. so actually i could make a pure css solution for this?
[08:31:32] <xec> voiter: but since you wanted to target the <a> (does not have the ID, i assume) you can't do that
[08:31:44] <xec> i just wanted to add that info in case you weren't aware ;)
[08:32:12] <voiter> i wasn't
[08:32:26] <voiter> but i can easily rewrite html such that i reach my goal.
[08:32:27] <voiter> thanks
[08:33:18] <xec> voiter: the normal use case is that the <a href="#section"> links to an area of the page with that ID
[08:33:29] <voiter> i see
[08:34:21] <xec> voiter: so having the ID on the same element you click, makes it kind of link to itself (doesn't make much sense)
[08:35:32] <xec> voiter: you could target it with a selector something like this instead: $('a[href$="+location.hash+"]')
[08:36:44] <xec> voiter: but it might be easier to just add a class to the element when it's clicked (changes to the hash in urls doesn't cause a reload)
[08:37:27] <xec> (it kind of sounds like you want to highlight part of a menu?)
[08:39:57] <voiter> xec, the user clicks on a link that leads to another page. on that page a certain row must be selected based on the hash
[08:40:14] <taplar> egh
[08:40:47] <xec> voiter: ok, in that case you can use the semi-complex selector i gave you
[08:42:54] <slavka`> Hey guys, been reading through the docs, but i just dont get the diff between: $( "#dataTable tbody tr" ).on( "click"..... and $( "#dataTable tbody" ).on( "click", "tr",
[08:43:34] <taplar> the second is a delegate binding
[08:43:51] <taplar> events from the children tr bubble up to the parent tbody to be evaluated
[08:44:03] <taplar> allowing for the children trs to be replaced/changed and logic still work
[08:45:17] <taplar> the first is a direct binding.  the elements must exist at the time of binding for it to apply.
[08:46:45] <taplar> comprende?
[08:46:53] <slavka`> taplar, firstly thanks, do you know of any examples that show differences between the two?
[08:47:08] <taplar> i can throw together one really quick
[08:47:31] <slavka`> would really be appreciated
[08:47:38] <xec> how quick?
[08:47:42] * xec readies his stopwatch
[08:48:23] <taplar> shsss, your slowing me down, :)
[08:48:35] <xec> :D no pressure
[08:48:47] <slavka`> taplar, i just stumbled onto to this... https://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/
[08:49:08] <slavka`> i havent read it through so maybe hold off on the example... wouldnt want to waste your time if that url will explain it
[08:51:24] <xec> slavka`: if you never add a new row to the table, there is little difference
[08:52:27] <xec> slavka`: but if you add a row after you select all the rows, (using "#dataTable tbody tr")  the new row won't have a click event bound to it
[08:53:02] <taplar> contrived example
[08:53:02] <taplar> http://jsfiddle.net/7yz5j4t0/
[08:54:33] <taplar> ^the indirect list works for the click as it operates off of the parent and evaluates the children
[08:54:51] <taplar> the direct one doesn't work at all as the elements did not exist at the time the bind was applied, so none of the elements have that handler
[08:57:15] <xec> just to make it slightly clearer: http://jsfiddle.net/7yz5j4t0/1/
[09:05:54] <taplar> i shoulda had queen don't stop me now playing while i was typing that
[09:06:21] <taplar> except for, ya know, the whole call me now if you wanna have a good time
[09:06:23] <taplar> .... don't call me
[09:07:15] <taplar> just music bombed myself.  *runs off to youtube*
[09:07:20] <xec> lol
[09:08:54] * xec whistles the popcorn tune
[09:12:41] <taplar> yeeeaah
[09:20:49] <sweet2k4> why is the selector wrong: $('#email-form #email').val(). I have a form with the ID of email-form, and a field with the ID of email
[09:23:03] <taplar> should be valid then, though really you could just do the #email part
[09:23:37] <sweet2k4> taplar: strange, returns undefined
[09:23:57] <xec> sweet2k4: maybe a typo in one of the ID names?
[09:23:58] <taplar> console log the length of the two selectors and see what you get
[09:24:05] <xec> sweet2k4: given your premise it should work
[09:24:54] <xec> sweet2k4: also; have you made sure the selector is ran after the DOM nodes actually exist?
[09:24:58] <sweet2k4> ok, well then i know the selector isnt wrong, and i can go on looking for the problem
[09:25:15] <xec> i.e. wrapped inside dom ready
[09:26:01] <sweet2k4> xec: its an ajax call dom is ready since the button is clicked manually
[09:28:39] <sweet2k4> okey so i think i found the problem, i had a registration from and login form on the same page, and the email input instance was defined at 2 places with the same ID
[09:29:02] <sweet2k4> when i changed #email to #login-email it worked
[09:29:34] <sweet2k4> ty for the help

[10:09:32] <star_prone> Hi all
[10:10:55] <star_prone> I have the following problem: I'm loading a bootstrap modal using an ajax request; my javascript code is located in a file which is loaded before I load the modal window, which means that I cannot attach an event handler on an element from the modal window
[10:11:37] <star_prone> is there a way to attach the event even if the DOM doesn't have that specific element
[10:11:40] <star_prone> ?
[10:11:49] <hellyeah> what
[10:12:23] <hellyeah> how will you add event to the element when that doesnt exist in the DOM
[10:12:36] <hellyeah> i am not expert but that does nt make really sense
[10:12:48] <hellyeah> if you can do it what will you do with it?
[10:19:03] <Juslintek> Hi can anyone tell me why $(this).load(remote_url+' #target_div', function(data){ console.log(data)}); return full html, even though #target_div is just two divs below the body.
[10:20:51] <Juslintek> url looks like this: http://vezejai.lt/naujas-marsrutas/ #main
[10:24:37] <Cork> Juslintek: the callback for .load is for complete
[10:24:45] <Cork> it gives you the raw responsetext
[10:25:00] <Cork> while the selector in the url is for what is appended to the element
[10:25:17] <Juslintek> Cork, okay but still $(this) is a container and it gets full html even though #main is specified
[10:25:22] <Juslintek> and it messes all the js in the html
[10:25:55] <Cork> Juslintek: well the selector might not match, not sure
[10:28:09] <Juslintek> Cork, okay here is the source, how do I select .w2dc-content?
[10:29:14] <Cork> Juslintek: it should be a normal selector, i've always seen that as a hack so i've never actually used it my self
[10:29:34] <Cork> i've always done the filtering server side (as a partial)
[10:29:52] <Cork> why send data you don't want
[10:29:54] <Juslintek> Cork, okay then how to parse that specific div out of that html?
[10:30:07] <Cork> you don't :)
[10:30:32] <Cork> you create the full page by including a partial that only contains that div
[10:30:46] <Cork> when you just want that div you request that resource directly
[10:33:33] <Juslintek> Guess I'll have to add some criteria then, on that template.
[10:33:41] <Juslintek> Okay, so that is load using post?
[10:34:23] <Juslintek> And will passing {'is_this_active': 1 }, would for for isset($_POST['is_this_active'])?
[10:35:36] <Cork> Juslintek: it is loaded using get
[10:35:48] <Cork> if you want post you would have to use $.post or $.ajax
[10:36:08] <Cork> though note that post means the request can't be cached
[10:36:51] <Juslintek> So I guess I'll stick with get
[10:43:09] <Juslintek> Damn it I can't do it.
[10:43:22] <Juslintek> I need to rewrite controller...
[10:43:25] <JAM_> what do you need?
[10:43:52] <Juslintek> JAM_MX, I want to specify div in .load teruned content
[10:44:00] <Juslintek> returned*
[10:45:27] <Cork> Juslintek: so just do $.ajax('url', function(data) { $($.parseHTML(data)).find('selector') }
[10:45:37] <Cork> that way you can do what ever you like with it
[10:46:39] <Cork> the other was just my recommendation and why i don't have a hands on experience for your problem
[10:47:48] <JAM_MX> $.ajax({
[10:47:49] <JAM_MX>   url: "test.html",
[10:47:49] <JAM_MX>   cache: false
[10:47:50] <JAM_MX> })
[10:47:52] <JAM_MX>   .done(function( html ) {
[10:47:54] <JAM_MX>     $( "#results" ).append( html );
[10:47:56] <JAM_MX>   });
[10:48:07] <JAM_MX> ups
[10:48:17] <Cork> JAM_MX: don't dump code in the channel
[10:48:37] <JAM_MX> sorry, i do it for error :-(
[10:48:49] <Cork> also he wants to filter out content from the response
[10:49:19] <Cork> but the selector in the .load url isn't working for him
[10:50:14] <JAM_MX> in the .done function add a alert(html) to see if the url return some text
[10:52:46] <JAM_MX> Juslintek have your code in some site?
[10:53:35] <BlueShark> If I'm displaying several links inside a div (say .foo). As of now, I have a .click handler assigned to that class and it works fine. Now how would I be able to identify which link was clicked?
[10:53:39] <JAM_MX> like https://codepen.io/pen/
[10:53:49] <BlueShark> S/If //
[10:53:49] <b-ot> Correction, <BlueShark> I'm displaying several links inside a div (say .foo). As of now, I have a .click handler assigned to that class and it works fine. Now how would I be able to identify which link was clicked?
[10:53:59] <Cork> BlueShark: "this"
[10:54:03] <Cork> it is the clicked link
[10:54:33] <Cork> if the handler is for the links that is
[10:54:55] <BlueShark> Didn't get "if the handler is for the links that is".
[10:55:08] <JAM_MX> $('a.link').click(function(){ url = $(this).attr("href"); });
[10:55:14] <Cork> BlueShark: this is the element the handler was bound to
[10:55:27] <Cork> JAM_MX: also you don't want to use that selector
[10:56:03] <BlueShark> So is it better if I just use a class and assign it to all the links? Or put them all inside a div with a class and then use that?
[10:56:15] <Cork> BlueShark: what you want is something like this: $('#div').on('click', 'a', function() { console.log(this.href); })
[10:56:47] <Cork> where #div is meant to match the div, use what ever selector you want for that
[10:56:59] <Cork> that event handler will then handler all <a> elements inside it
[10:57:04] <JAM_MX> my english is bad to help :-S
[10:57:10] <Cork> (current of future)
[10:57:25] <Cork> JAM_MX: the problem was that you didn't delegate the handler
[10:57:52] <Cork> also $(this).attr('href') is a bit of a wast when you can just use this.href :)
[11:00:11] <JAM_MX> some like this?: $('.foo a').on("click",function(){ url = $this.href; });
[11:00:19] <Cork> no
[11:00:27] <Cork> check the difference in how i wrote the selector
[11:00:55] <Cork> $('#div').on('click', 'a' <--
[11:01:21] <Cork> that binds the event handler on the div parent, and then listens for bubbling events
[11:01:30] <BlueShark> Ah.
[11:01:36] <Cork> instead of $('.foo a') that searches for all a tags it can find
[11:01:43] <Cork> then loops them and bind a click handler to each of them
[11:01:57] <BlueShark> So put them all inside a div with a class and then use that as the selector?
[11:02:03] <Cork> the later means, that if you later att a new link it won't have a handler so won't work
[11:02:20] <Cork> BlueShark: $('selector that matches the div')
[11:02:40] <Cork> then .on('click', 'a', function() { this })
[11:02:49] <Cork> this in that function will be the link clicked
[11:06:24] <Cork> BlueShark: http://jsfiddle.net/rjfc5kbh/
[11:08:37] <JAM_MX> this same code in codepen.io don't work :-S
[11:09:14] <Cork> JAM_MX: most likely cause jsfiddle wrapps things in onload by default
[11:09:37] <Cork> you have to wrap it in $(function() {}) in a simplre page
[11:09:42] <Cork> simpler
[11:09:59] <BlueShark> Cork: Excellent. Thank you.
[11:10:23] <BlueShark> So if it were data-href instead of href, you'd write $(this).attr('data-href') or there's a shorter version like this.href?
[11:10:42] <Cork> $(this).data('href')
[11:11:26] <Cork> BlueShark: though you should have a working href on a elements...
[11:11:38] <Cork> so data-href sounds... write
[11:11:42] <Cork> *weird
[11:11:47] <Cork> man i hate this keyboard
[11:12:11] <BlueShark> If there's href on links, it would take the user to a different page. I don't want that...
[11:12:29] <Cork> BlueShark: not if you use event.preventDefault()
[11:12:36] <Cork> BlueShark: like i did in the jsfiddle
[11:14:56] <JAM_MX> i see some thing, if use this.href the result is all the url, if use $(this).attr("href") the result is just the value in href
[11:15:05] <Cork> ya
[11:15:19] <Cork> cause attr uses getAttribute
[11:15:44] <Cork> $(this).attr('href') == this,getAttribute('href')
[11:16:08] <Cork> JAM_MX: though note href is actually close to the only situation where you should use .attr
[11:16:18] <Cork> in all other case .prop() is what you want
[11:16:47] <Cork> a BIG no no is to do $(':checkbox').attr('checked', 'checked')
[11:17:03] <Cork> or $(':checkbox').attr('checked', true) for that matter
[11:17:46] <Cork> the correct syntax there is $(':checkbox').prop('checked', true)
[11:18:05] <Cork> also note that $(':checkbox').attr('checked', false) won't work
[11:18:07] <Cork> (at all)
[11:50:54] <BlueShark> Currently I have a gif that is displayed when an ajax request is being processed. I use $(document).ajaxStop(function() { $("#loaderbox").hide(); }); to hide it when the request is complete. But it's so fast that the gif is barely visible. What's a good solution here?
[11:56:47] <Juslintek> Cork, what is the difference between attr and prop? Attribute property.
[11:57:18] <NitroLiq> Hi folks. I've function that acts as a basic search toggle but a little confused as to how to set it to it's default hidden state or slide it back up by clicking anywhere else aside from the actual toggle
[11:57:27] <NitroLiq> https://jsfiddle.net/0on75hnr/6/
[11:57:31] <Juslintek> Because now I guess, that prop is for states of element.
[12:02:01] <t_b_b_> Hi all, could anyone tell me how i get the text from a specific td value from a lousy formatted table -> http://jsfiddle.net/jx11pv2g/
[12:02:26] <t_b_b_> i would like to get this value -> 01.11.2015
[12:11:02] <t_b_b_> firebug says -> tr.tabellenzeile2:nth-child(24) > td:nth-child(3) but $(tr.tabellenzeile2:nth-child(2) > td:nth-child(3)).text() won't deliver text, it stops the script and i don't know why
[12:11:42] <robertmaxrees> t_b_b_ are you using jquery or plain javascript?
[12:11:52] <t_b_b_> jquery
[12:12:00] <claytonzaugg> What channel should I ask about performance tricks or bandwidth enhancements for site performance?
[12:12:00] <robertmaxrees> show us what you've tried.
[12:12:17] <robertmaxrees> claytonzaugg #web and ##javascript might both be good stops for that.
[12:12:40] <claytonzaugg> Thanks robertmaxrees
[12:13:52] <t_b_b_> http://jsfiddle.net/jx11pv2g/3/
[12:14:48] <robertmaxrees> t_b_b_ errr...
[12:15:33] <robertmaxrees> sounds like you need to do a basic tutorial.
[12:17:54] <t_b_b_> i use jquery a lot with other selectors' like $('input[name=kdnr]').val() which works fine, but this selector from firebug i don't know how i have to format it to use it
[12:18:04] <robertmaxrees> that's not the selector you want.
[12:18:12] <robertmaxrees> you want .index() and chain from there.
[12:20:28] <robertmaxrees> though you could use it - http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/jx11pv2g/4/
[12:20:33] <robertmaxrees> it''s a string like any other.
[12:27:37] <checkit> Hey guys... What would be a good selector for all href elements with data-type="submit"?
[12:27:45] <robertmaxrees> nothing.
[12:27:49] <robertmaxrees> use a class for .filter()
[12:28:44] <t_b_b_> what i want is the exact inner text of this element. console lo or alert does not give me the certain string 01.11.2015
[12:32:34] <huck5> Trying to change an elements HTML, and getting "invalid left-hand operation". I'm doing something like `$("#myP").parent().html() = '<b>' + $("#myP").parent().html()  + '</b>'` .
[12:32:45] <robertmaxrees> t_b_b_ that's what you're getting with that selector.
[12:32:53] <huck5> Basically want to be able to add bold tags to the current html. Any suggestions?
[12:33:14] <robertmaxrees> huck5 you need to pass that to .html()
[12:33:23] <robertmaxrees> you can't set the return of a function to a string.
[12:33:27] <huck5> ah ok, thanks! Wondered about that. Probably should have just tried it :P
[12:33:35] <robertmaxrees>  $("#myP").parent().html('<b>' + $("#myP").parent().html()  + '</b>')
[12:33:35] <huck5> yeah. That makes total sense -.-
[12:33:51] <huck5> Thanks robertmaxrees !
[12:34:20] <t_b_b_> just want to parse what is in there so i can use the information otherwhere
[12:34:34] <robertmaxrees> t_b_b_ so are you stuck on getting the correct selector?
[12:34:37] <t_b_b_> in specific the 01.01.2015
[12:34:43] <t_b_b_> i guess
[12:34:48] <robertmaxrees> because you need a valid table at the very least.
[12:35:10] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/jx11pv2g/5/ t_b_b_ see?
[12:36:21] <t_b_b_> ah okay, i got two table tags with no id that could be the problem
[12:43:30] <checkit> robertmaxrees: How would you use .filter() in that way?
[12:44:02] <robertmaxrees> checkit $('.someParent').find('a').filter(function() { return $(this).data('somename') });
[12:46:29] <t_b_b_> robertmaxrees: yeah i got that after you said it, but it does not work on my whole page till know - there are much tables without id's may thats the Problem, i will try to find the issue, thx for now
[12:47:23] <robertmaxrees> t_b_b_ you'll need to target the particular table you care about.
[12:57:42] <t_b_b_> it is the last table there before are more tables any table without class or id
[12:58:02] <t_b_b_> how can i reference the last table on that messy site
[12:58:42] <robertmaxrees> https://www.google.com/search?q=jquery+get+last+element
[12:58:43] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[12:59:09] <robertmaxrees> if there's some other criteria you can use (say, a heading or something), use that instead.
[13:08:56] <t_b_b_> okay, think i got it, but table:last tr .... won't deliver me my content, perhaps its a table within a table
[13:49:35] <royalty> hello
[13:49:45] <royalty> can anyone give me tips on restructuring this code? https://gist.github.com/Modicrumb/0a3ee567598263aef4f3
[13:49:49] <royalty> i feel like it's a mess
[13:50:16] <robertmaxrees> almost every variable in there is global.
[13:50:42] <robertmaxrees> <?= $domainData ?> ells me you're writing this out using something like ASP, which is a no-no
[13:51:09] <royalty> I'm using PHP
[13:51:09] <royalty> lol
[13:51:19] <robertmaxrees> either or.
[13:51:25] <robertmaxrees> don't write code using code.
[13:51:32] <royalty> huh
[13:51:41] <robertmaxrees> don't use PHP to generate javascript.
[13:51:52] <royalty> well i'm trying to turn this jsonified data into a variable
[13:51:54] <royalty> so i can use it
[13:52:02] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:52:05] <robertmaxrees> "hey give me feedback"
[13:52:09] <royalty> well
[13:52:11] <robertmaxrees> "well here's an excuse" ;)
[13:52:14] <royalty> i'm just asking what is the way around it
[13:52:16] <robertmaxrees> write out JSON
[13:52:22] <robertmaxrees> and read that in instead.
[13:52:35] <royalty> i need to grab it from the server though
[13:52:48] <robertmaxrees> your server can write JSON out to the page elswhere.
[13:52:50] <jak2000> jquery question: i have a div at the top of a table, and other div at the end of the table (both divs have the same name and same class) i fill the table with item / quantity (with Java code, JSP) i have a final Sum, but only in the last div i see the sum, in the first div, continue seeing a '0'  here so so the fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/jamiguel77/zjmoagpx/1/
[13:52:55] <robertmaxrees> namespace it and pull your data into there.
[13:53:10] <royalty> robertmaxrees, how do i namespace it?
[13:53:27] <royalty> i guess i'll google that lol
[13:54:05] <robertmaxrees> window.myApp = {};
[13:54:22] <robertmaxrees> window.myApp.myData = whateverinfoyouwant.;
[13:55:24] <t_b_b_> robertmaxrees: do you have ever experience with greasemonkey add-on or tapermonkey
[13:55:34] <t_b_b_> -have +had
[13:55:37] <royalty> robertmaxrees, ;MYNAMESPACE = {
[13:55:37] <royalty> 	myFunction: function()
[13:55:37] <royalty> 	{
[13:55:37] <royalty> 		console.log('running MYNAMESPACE.myFunction...');
[13:55:37] <royalty> 	}
[13:55:38] <royalty> 	
[13:55:40] <royalty> }
[13:55:40] <robertmaxrees> woah.
[13:55:42] <royalty> MYNAMESPACE.myFunction();
[13:55:46] <robertmaxrees> hey don't paste code into the channel.
[13:55:47] <royalty> would this be acceptable too? also sorry for that
[13:55:49] <robertmaxrees> t_b_b_ nope.
[13:55:56] <robertmaxrees> royalty try again in bpaste or something.
[13:56:03] <t_b_b_> anyone around here who has?
[13:56:10] <robertmaxrees> t_b_b_ wrong channel to ask in ;)
[13:56:35] <royalty> robertmaxrees, http://pastie.org/10549039
[13:56:46] <robertmaxrees> that's not json, but sure.
[13:57:12] <t_b_b_> it seems no-one in that channel :-)
[13:57:31] <robertmaxrees> t_b_b_ doesn't change the topic of this one ;)
[13:57:58] <t_b_b_> k, understood
[13:57:58] <taplar> what does the ; in front of NAMESPACE do?
[13:58:25] <robertmaxrees> taplar it tries to protect you from other people forgetting a closing semicolon.
[13:58:32] <taplar> ah
[13:58:34] <robertmaxrees> and then omits the var keyword.
[13:58:35] <jak2000> robertmaxrees any advice?
[13:58:35] <taplar> interesting
[13:58:36] <robertmaxrees> or a window. prefix
[13:58:53] <royalty> robertmaxrees, so would i namespace all the code or just the global variables?
[13:59:18] <robertmaxrees> royalty i'd write out the "global data" into that global object and then access it through window.whateverName
[13:59:31] <robertmaxrees> and then put your other code in an IIFE to "sandbox" it.
[13:59:39] <royalty> IIFE?
[13:59:53] <robertmaxrees> (function() { /* your code here */ }());
[13:59:58] <royalty> ah ok
[14:00:33] <robertmaxrees> also, lint your code.
[14:00:39] <robertmaxrees> you're missing some semicolons.
[14:00:51] <royalty> ok
[14:00:53] <robertmaxrees> and avoid using array accessor notation.
[14:00:56] <robertmaxrees> use . instead.
[14:01:08] <royalty> why?
[14:01:12] <robertmaxrees> much more readable.
[14:02:36] <royalty> robertmaxrees, does namespaced code allow for persistence in variables?
[14:02:38] <robertmaxrees> the only case i'd use it is when you're dynamically evaluating property names.
[14:02:51] <robertmaxrees> "namespace" was a poor choice of word on my behalf.
[14:02:57] <robertmaxrees> but what do you mean "allow for persistence"?
[14:03:02] <royalty> for instance can i reset a variable in the namespace to a different value and then access it later
[14:03:06] <robertmaxrees> yes.
[14:03:13] <robertmaxrees> it's an object.  just like any other.
[14:03:17] <royalty> ah ok
[14:04:03] <robertmaxrees> the whole point is to not use PHP at all two write out your JS.
[14:04:09] <robertmaxrees> your JS should be in a .js file.
[14:04:32] <royalty> hmmm
[14:04:39] <robertmaxrees> always.
[14:06:02] <royalty> i still don't get how that helps though I will need $domainData; I thought it was about the global variable style I was about to do something like window.domainChart = { var domainData = <?= $domainData; ?>}
[14:06:29] <robertmaxrees> that's now how you do that.
[14:06:50] <robertmaxrees> window.whateverName = <?= $domainData =>;
[14:07:18] <royalty> why is that more acceptable though, amn't i doing the same thing?
[14:07:34] <royalty> it feels better though and i will do it just curious
[14:07:37] <robertmaxrees> you're using PHP to generate code in your logic.
[14:07:41] <robertmaxrees> that's gross.
[14:07:44] <robertmaxrees> have the PHP generate data.
[14:07:52] <robertmaxrees> separations of concern are much better.
[14:07:55] <robertmaxrees> now your JS is just JS.
[14:08:01] <royalty> I see
[14:08:02] <royalty> okay
[14:15:43] <_Noobie_> Can someone help me with an issue I'm having?  My coutdown timer is not showing and/or running in the latest versions of Internet Explorer
[14:15:58] <robertmaxrees> just show us your code - if somebody can help, they will.
[14:17:26] <_Noobie_> http://jsfiddle.net/ThatWebGuy_/r52jkdnr/
[14:17:27] <jak2000> i try this: http://jsfiddle.net/jamiguel77/zjmoagpx/3/   <-- my main problem is how to change a value of 2 divs, when page end of load :(
[14:18:54] <taplar> your wanting to sum the second column?
[14:19:17] <jak2000> yes
[14:19:19] <robertmaxrees> _Noobie_ if (temp1 < temp2) { - i don't think this does what you want it to.
[14:19:36] <taplar> are all the values expected to be integers?
[14:19:44] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 you're missing jquery in your fieeld.
[14:19:48] <robertmaxrees> and checkout parseFloat()
[14:20:13] <_Noobie_> Okay.  What would be the best way for me to test the current day/time against the countdown value and hide the box if it's past it?
[14:20:20] <_Noobie_> robertmaxrees
[14:20:25] <robertmaxrees> use moment.js
[14:20:34] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, search around online.
[14:21:07] <_Noobie_> okay.  I will look at moment.  THanks
[14:24:10] <cerkauskas> hello. I have trouble doi ng scrollTop. My current code is https://gist.github.com/cerkauskas/7e6a1752a170ac7adc82, but it scrolls to middle of page, not where the element actually is. Site has preloader. What am I doing wrong?
[14:25:08] <robertmaxrees> make a fiddle maybe?
[14:26:15] <robertmaxrees> also, you have a window.location.hash
[14:31:33] <jak2000> robertmaxrees thanks
[14:31:34] <jak2000> done! i writeh a document ready function at the end of my JSP file :) and do the jobmuch thanks for your advices
[14:34:47] <jak2000> is possible, display a hourglass icon when i fill a table, and when finish (document ready) return to default icon?
[14:38:24] <_Noobie_> robertmaxrees that worked.  Thanks.  Now to rewrite my timer with moment.js since all of my values show aN current.  LOL
[14:38:30] <_Noobie_> Never ending cycle.
[14:42:43] <OscuroAA> I have a page with a certain element. I have a command that searches for this element. On two pages I have this button - only on one page does the searched-for element exist. However, when navigating between the pages and pressing the button, it initially responds with the previous-pages element-search result..
[14:42:48] <OscuroAA> (sorry if that makes no sense)
[14:43:21] <OscuroAA> Why would jQuery be finding elements on a previously visited page? Only happens first time i  click the button. Second time it behaves as expected..
[14:43:31] <cerkauskas> robetmaxrees, http://creativeshock.lt/conference/#register it should scroll to bottom
[15:08:57] <t_b_b_> would like to replace some text within a fieldset don't know what i do wrong, could someone take a look at it
[15:08:58] <t_b_b_> http://jsfiddle.net/jx11pv2g/7/
[15:09:50] <t_b_b_> sorry forget about it found it myself
[15:09:52] <t_b_b_> typo
[15:10:26] <royalty> robertmaxrees, namespace thing was golden advice, i was able to refactor so much code, going to keep at it for now
[15:25:08] <OscuroAA> I have a parent-div "#AssetList". Neseted inside this, within some other divs, is an input with 'name=companyAsset'. How can I select this elemen with jQuery, given that it is not a direct-descendent of the "#AssetList" div?
[15:26:55] <NoiseEee> $('#assetList').find('input[name="companyAsset"]') should work OscuroAA
[15:26:56] <OscuroAA> Nm, i figured it out. I'll just use $("#AssetList").find(...)
[15:27:00] <OscuroAA> yeah, thanks NoiseEee  :)
[15:27:09] <NoiseEee> haha yep np
[15:27:30] <OscuroAA> From there, though, how can I use .filter() to look for a "data-cacheval=true" attribute?
[15:29:20] <OscuroAA> $("#AssetList").find("input[name='companyAsset']").attr('data-cacheval','true'); seems to work, for the record.
[15:33:17] <NoiseEee> well, that's actually going to set "data-cacheval" to "true" on the input element @ OscuroAA
[15:33:38] <OscuroAA> NoiseEee, Oh dear. That is not what i want at all.
[15:34:02] <NoiseEee> a different element has "data-cacheval", or the particular input you seek?
[15:34:20] <OscuroAA> A number of elements do. I want to grab all of them, where data-cacheval=true
[15:34:20] <NoiseEee> anyways fwiw you can search by "data-cacheval" the same way you searched for "name" ^^
[15:34:32] <OscuroAA> oh great, ty
[15:35:01] <OscuroAA> NoiseEee, that seems to work perfectly. Cheers!
[15:35:17] <NoiseEee> so you can simply do a someReference.find('[data-cacheval'])   or  someReference.find('[data-cacheval="someSpecificValue"]')
[15:35:22] <NoiseEee> yep no prob
[15:44:15] <btsrlz> Is anyone familiar with Datatables rowReorder, specifically attempting to scroll when dragging, and willing to lend assistance?
[15:44:24] <thebope> I've got a very simple script running "$(this).attr('class', 'btn team-btn btn-default')" and for some reason the 'active' class keeps appearing on my div element? Has this happened to anyone else before?
[15:48:44] <thebope> Whatever, just switched it to activated since the active class didn't really matter anyways
[15:51:50] <btsrlz> For some reason, when using Datatables rowReorder, the table doesn't scroll with the dragged row. Here's a fiddle, if anyone cares to take a stab..  https://jsfiddle.net/8zpdc0mt/
[15:53:57] <btsrlz> I'm also using the mCustomScrollbar plugin, so that might provide a workaround with clever use of the 'scrollTo' option
[16:07:49] <robertmaxrees> btsrlz you'll pyobably have more luck in their forums.
[16:27:28] <steeze> i'm sure i'm just doing something stupid, but when i do a $('.someElem').remove() and later try to do a $('.parentElem').append('<div class="someElem:></div>'), it won't actually append it. it just remains removed. anyone quickly see what im doing wrong?
[16:29:27] <steeze> .detach() does the same thing
[16:29:50] <robertmaxrees> let me make a fiddle i guess.
[16:30:19] <robertmaxrees> are you sure that append call is correct?
[16:30:21] <steeze> are you talking to me? i was about to make one, just thought this might be a quick one
[16:30:24] <steeze> yeah lemme show you
[16:30:33] <robertmaxrees> because you're missing a quote in there.
[16:30:40] <steeze> yeah just a typo
[16:30:55] <steeze> the append works, it just keeps appending the element each time. im trying to remove it, and reappend it when some other stuff changes
[16:31:04] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[16:31:14] <robertmaxrees> something here isn't making sense.
[16:31:28] <robertmaxrees> you said that the append doesn't append, but now you're saying it does.
[16:31:46] <steeze> it appends when i dont do a remove
[16:31:47] <steeze> sorry
[16:31:53] <robertmaxrees> err.
[16:31:54] <steeze> and of course it works in the jsfiddle. wth
[16:31:59] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[16:32:04] <robertmaxrees> i feel like there's some context missing.
[16:32:10] <steeze> haha lemme paste my code
[16:32:25] <steeze> http://pastebin.com/fD8A7eeq
[16:33:04] <steeze> it's a mess of a function. it's a custom wordpress plugin with some dumb hacks to work with callbacks from other plugins
[16:33:13] <robertmaxrees> err so what's the issue hjere?
[16:33:27] <steeze> anyway, line 7 and 8 i remove the element. in the if statements, i append the right header and body
[16:33:43] <steeze> anyway, if the removes arent there, the elements keep getting appended after each other (as i expect), the problem now
[16:33:54] <steeze> when i have the remove()'s in there, there's just nothing. no elements get appended
[16:33:56] <steeze> it's just blank
[16:34:36] <robertmaxrees> jQuery('.bs-descriptions-header').remove(); followed by jQuery('.bs-descriptions-header').append('...
[16:34:38] <robertmaxrees> see the issue?
[16:35:03] <steeze> no
[16:35:15] <steeze> i remove the two inside elements. then append to the parent element
[16:35:18] <robertmaxrees> jQuery('.bs-descriptions-header').remove();  removes that element.  you can no longer append to it since it doesn't exist.
[16:35:27] <fortifyfortyfort> robertmaxrees: And why is that a problem?
[16:35:41] <steeze> i remove the inside elements then append to the containing element
[16:35:53] <robertmaxrees> steeze that's now what .remove() does ;)
[16:36:04] <steeze> what
[16:36:09] <robertmaxrees> *not
[16:36:20] <steeze> what does it do
[16:36:26] <robertmaxrees> https://api.jquery.com/remove/ -> "Remove the set of matched elements from the DOM."
[16:36:31] <robertmaxrees> you want .empty() instead
[16:36:41] <steeze> empty will probably but work thanks,
[16:36:43] <steeze> but let me get this straight
[16:36:51] <steeze> i have a containing div with two divs inside
[16:36:57] <steeze> im removing the two DIVS inside
[16:37:00] <steeze> not the containing element
[16:37:10] <steeze> so why wont it let me append shit to the containing element after removing inside elements
[16:37:24] <steeze> this doesnt make sense, and in my jsfiddle i got it to work as expected, so im a little confused
[16:37:28] <robertmaxrees> in which case?  dog?
[16:37:39] <steeze> any case
[16:37:49] <robertmaxrees> you realize the three conditionals are not all doing the same thing, right?
[16:38:05] <robertmaxrees> in horse and bull you have jQuery('.bs-descriptions-header'), in dog it's just jQuery('.bs-descriptions')
[16:38:12] <steeze> oi
[16:38:37] * steeze hides in corner
[16:38:48] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[16:39:03] <steeze> <3
[16:39:35] <steeze> well i obviously need to take a break and walk around the building or something
[16:43:20] <OscuroAA> Appending a dynamically created ddl to an element, this ddl is not getting styled?
[16:43:37] <robertmaxrees> OscuroAA should be fine.
[16:43:42] <mtt5> Can anyone recommend a plugin to display a PDF in a page with pagination. Maybe even lazy loading?
[16:43:49] <OscuroAA> OK, thanks. Must be applying my styles wrong, Thanks!
[16:44:04] <robertmaxrees> OscuroAA calls to .css() before you append it won't apply, but normal css will.
[16:44:31] <OscuroAA> robertmaxrees, ok thanks. I don't make any calls to .css(), so I guess it should be OK.
[16:48:01] <mtt5> Looking for something like this but preferably not SaaS http://fliphtml5.com/
[16:48:30] <robertmaxrees> mtt5 that's a lucrative business.
[16:48:50] <robertmaxrees> there's not going to be a lot of options - especially not for what you want.
[16:49:34] <mtt5> That's what I was afraid of. Just not a huge fan of using a SaaS when I just need it for 1 page
[16:49:43] <robertmaxrees> what exactly do you need?
[16:49:50] <mtt5> That, lol
[16:50:00] <mtt5> For a PDF catalog
[16:50:01] <robertmaxrees> you need page flip for a single image?
[16:50:01] <robertmaxrees> wat
[16:50:50] <mtt5> wat wat
[16:51:08] <robertmaxrees> what features of that do you need for a single page?
[16:51:24] <robertmaxrees> like, how is something supposed to "flip" if there's... nothing to flip.
[16:51:52] <mtt5> Sorry, I had mentioned it above. I display a PDF in a page with pagination. Maybe even lazy loading.
[16:51:59] <mtt5> I have 56 page catalog
[16:52:12] <robertmaxrees> ooookay, so you have an entire catalog you'd like to make look pretty.
[16:52:18] <robertmaxrees> you'll need to build that yourself.
[16:52:39] <mtt5> Yes, I just meant the catalog would be only on 1 page. My bad.
[16:52:40] <robertmaxrees> though i'll tell you that people really don't care about the pretty animations and stuff.
[16:52:53] <robertmaxrees> just build a simple site to do it.
[16:54:04] <mtt5> It's already going in an ecommerce site. Was just hoping to give customers an option of browsing the PDF online along with downloading.
[16:54:28] <robertmaxrees> i work ecommerce and used to work at a company that did, among other things, catalog conversion services ;)
[16:54:58] <robertmaxrees> so i'd say don't worry about all the extra bells and whistles.
[16:55:23] <mtt5> Yeah, would be nice but not worth $15/month imo
[16:55:31] <robertmaxrees> right, i'm saying build it yourself.
[16:55:43] <robertmaxrees> a simple solution without all the extra stuff.
[17:00:31] <mtt5> Actually, I think this is perfect. http://codecanyon.net/item/jquery-document-viewer/1732515
[17:01:33] <robertmaxrees> lol you could basically build that yourself, but okay :)
[17:01:59] <mtt5> Yeah, but $7. I have other things I need to get done too.
[17:02:06] <robertmaxrees> lol whatevs mang
[17:02:18] <mtt5> haha, thanks though
[17:21:57] <mtt5> robertmaxrees, you win. No IE support on that plugin :/
[17:27:21] <OscuroAA> So... when I write a <select> into my HTML, it's dynamically placed into a couple of divs in order to stylize it. (This must be from jquery mobile ui?). When I create a <select> at runtime and .appendTo() it to something, this div creation doesn't take place..
[17:27:25] <OscuroAA> and so it isn't styled properly..
[17:27:28] <OscuroAA> any advice?
[17:33:06] <robertmaxrees> OscuroAA https://api.jqueryui.com/selectmenu/
[17:33:49] <OscuroAA> oh, hey robertmaxrees . Thanks again!
[17:47:49] <OscuroAA> calling $("#mySelectMenu").selectmenu(); after appending it to my page did the trick.
[18:15:34] <Juslintek> Hi is there a simple way to get all related js to ajax fetched html and reinstantiate it?
[18:16:09] <robertmaxrees> i'd suggest maybe pulling the js into your main js file and manually firing it instead.
[18:16:38] <Juslintek> robertmaxrees, what do you mean by pulling?
[18:16:59] <robertmaxrees> having javascript in code you're ajaxing in is a little... weird.  put it into your js file instead.
[18:20:07] <Juslintek> robertmaxrees, well its a little complicated. I'm using on wordpress, one plugin, which loads js dependencies specific to page, defined per php class used in page. So basically, on that page I'm trying to modal load the html content, those jses aren't loaded. But I thought, there is some lib or trick, which could read binded event or function and at least try to run them on success again. To reconstruct the objects. If there would be some specific
[18:20:07] <Juslintek> functions missing at least I would know which ones and could look them up in plugins source and put it in main js file.
[18:20:58] <robertmaxrees> that's a wall of text.  if i understand correctly, you have some js you're trying to "re-run" after you ajax some stuff in?
[18:21:02] <robertmaxrees> code that ruins on pageload?
[18:21:13] <robertmaxrees> *runs
[18:21:25] <Juslintek> yes
[18:21:31] <robertmaxrees> that's easy.
[18:21:34] <robertmaxrees> put that code in a function.
[18:21:43] <robertmaxrees> call that function in the .done() callback for your ajax call.
[18:22:21] <Juslintek> do load has done trigger?
[18:23:02] <robertmaxrees> i'd use $.ajax() instead, but it has a success callback, yeah,.
[18:23:07] <Juslintek> can I do $(this).load(target_url).done()?
[18:23:19] <cannap> load? will this not load the content in a div
[18:23:20] <robertmaxrees> you can do .load(target_url, function() {});
[18:23:23] <Juslintek> or should I just use call back
[18:23:31] <Juslintek> yeah complete callback
[18:23:32] <robertmaxrees> you'll need the success callback in this case.
[18:23:43] <Juslintek> load doesn't have success
[18:23:47] <Juslintek> it only has complete
[18:23:48] <robertmaxrees> yes it does.
[18:23:51] <robertmaxrees> it's the second argument.
[18:23:59] <cannap> check statuscode
[18:24:08] <robertmaxrees> cannap you're conflating their problem ;)
[18:24:15] <robertmaxrees> they're trying to run JS when the load call finishes.
[18:24:25] <cannap> ah
[18:24:30] <cannap> many ways
[18:24:33] <robertmaxrees> Juslintek ah the documentation for load says it's the complete callback.  funky.
[18:24:42] <robertmaxrees> brb
[18:25:19] <cannap> when the status code comes in a its ok the request is finished
[18:25:27] <cannap> else its finished but some errors
[18:26:27] <Juslintek> well one way or another I need manually to find missing libs that are required to get the inputs interactive again, like tinymce and select2 need to find out as well specific params used on those inputs.
[18:27:10] <Juslintek> Is there easy way to fetch all binded source code per input?
[18:27:20] <Juslintek> For example on Chrome
[18:28:00] <Juslintek> Its so complicated to navigate that messy, html and still you're not sure if the function you've found is the one for that input.
[19:05:19] <Juslintek> Which tool is best tool for observing events on html?
[19:05:34] <Juslintek> Or which functions are binded to elements and track their source.
[19:06:52] <kevireilly> Chrome's Developer Tools has support
[20:26:35] <BigOrangeSU> is there any advantage to setting var this = $(this); within a function if i intend to use $(this) multiple times within a function
[20:26:57] <taplar> you only cause jquery to create the wrapped element once
[20:28:35] <BigOrangeSU> right is that a best practice?
[20:28:41] <BigOrangeSU> or is there any advantage to not doing that
[20:28:55] <taplar> no, you want to cache reused jquery objects
[20:29:19] <BigOrangeSU> oh ok i figured it was a delegate so it didnt reeally have an effect
[20:30:29] <taplar> everytime you do $() this guy has to execute
[20:30:31] <taplar> http://www.james.padolsey.com/jquery/#v=1.11.2&fn=jQuery.fn.init
[20:30:34] <taplar> :)
[21:55:43] <definity> for some reason when i seect a button and use prop to disable it, it also disables the text box, anyone know why?
[22:08:23] <krambal> If i have a <div id="div1><span><input type="checkbox" id="1"></span></div> how do i target the id of the check box so i can change it via setAttr
[22:23:05] <sdwrage> Hey all
[22:23:18] <sdwrage> Is there a way to do a click event only on a div container but not the children in it?
[22:31:23] <cjohnson> Is there a way to attach an event handler which will run after all other event handlers, regardless of the order they were attached?
[22:42:09] <cjohnson> Also: is there a way to perform a selector on an attribute based on a default value? eg <form><button /></form>  button[type=submit]
[22:42:17] <cjohnson> the default value for type is submit, but this selector doesn't select it
[22:46:32] <cjohnson> ok looks like for my second question I can use button:not([type]),button[type=submit]
[22:47:22] <hailhydra> can someone explain to me why  [for="id_all_day"] { background: red;} is a selector?
[22:48:49] <hailhydra> attributes of the element are being used as a CSS selector. What do you call this part of the DOM? It's not a node
[22:51:13] <cjohnson> hailhydra: #css ?
[22:51:21] <cjohnson> this is #jquery :)
[22:51:28] <hailhydra> DOM question?
[22:51:40] <cjohnson> you're asking about a CSS selector no?
[22:52:00] <hailhydra> yeah and jQuery uses CSS selectors for it's sizzle engine correct?
[22:52:02] <definity> for some reason when i seect a button and use prop to disable it, it also disables the text box, anyone know why? http://users.aber.ac.uk/pas43/cs25010/index.php I cant work out why my text box is disabled
[22:52:29] <cjohnson> well, they are based on css selectors, but that doesn't make #jquery the place ot ask about css selectors
[22:52:32] <cjohnson> #css is the place to ask
[22:52:58] <hailhydra> cjohnson, so basically you're saying. "I don't have a clue, go somewhere else"
[22:53:13] <cjohnson> no I'm suggesting a more appropriate place to find an answer to your question
[22:53:35] <hailhydra> css is just going to say it's an attribute selector
[22:53:50] * cjohnson shrugs
[22:54:20] <hailhydra> yeah if you have no valuable input maybe you shouldn't say anything
[22:55:07] <cjohnson> I did. you just don't want to hear it. hostility is not the path to help
[22:55:34] <cjohnson> but you're certainly free to keep trying that approach
[23:13:57] <amikrop> How do I see if a checkbox is checked? .val() doesn't seem to provide any info
[23:14:14] <amikrop> .val() is always the string "on" (even when checkbox is off)
[23:14:58] <cjohnson> checked is a property amikrop
[23:15:14] <cjohnson> <input type="checkbox" value="1" /> the value is always 1, checked or not
[23:15:26] <ScotTFO> http://jsfiddle.net/ThiefMaster/QR2fL/
[23:16:08] <amikrop> cjohnson: so, if (my_obj.prop('checked')) {
[23:16:08] <amikrop> ?
[23:16:16] <cjohnson> yep should be
[23:16:20] <amikrop> ok thx
[23:22:09] <sdwrage> Is there a way to do a click event only on a div container but not the children in it?
[23:22:53] <cjohnson> sdwrage: you could check e.target == theDiv
[23:28:58] <sdwrage> ah okay good idea.
[23:48:24] <sdwrage> cjohnson, nah that didn't work
