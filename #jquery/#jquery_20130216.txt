[00:25:47] <vadi21> I'm having an issue with the accordion, using the 'no auto height' - I put in the heightStyle: content, yet it still does not look as I expect nor how it looks on the demo. This is the page: http://www.mudlet.org/download how am I doing it wrong?
[00:29:16] <vadi21> Upgrading version used did it
[00:55:15] <macdev198012> hi
[01:19:33] <Alexandru> Hello guys. Does anybody have a clue on how can I pass this from Jquery to PHP? http://pastebin.com/8gR5ifpB
[01:20:41] <morteza_ipo> hi , and why?! :D
[01:21:15] <morteza_ipo> I wanna use live , but in new version "live" removed! and instead of that we should use "on"
[01:21:41] <morteza_ipo> but why "on" can't work for live elements?
[01:21:42] <Alexandru> Well, when the page loads, the padding applies after its loaded and looks lame
[01:28:21] <morteza_ipo> so why "on" can't work for live elements?
[01:38:31] <joooo72> hey guys.. I have a div in the middle of the screen, which is large, i want to shift this to the top left of the page, and at the same time scale it down so it becomes smaller and then sits in the top left of the page.. how can this be done?
[01:52:37] <sunuslee> hi, i  got a question. i put a function in $(document).ready() {â€¦} and call it. it will be called after the page is loaded, right?
[02:05:06] <WilliamRoberts> I'm really new at jquery sunuslee, but I am using the $(document).ready and yes, when the page is fully loaded the functions I have execute.
[02:06:08] <sunuslee> WilliamRoberts:  http://jsfiddle.net/gmLcy/ please take a look at this
[02:06:13] <joooo72> hey guys.. I have a div in the middle of the screen, which is large, i want to shift this to the top left of the page, and at the same time scale it down so it becomes smaller and then sits in the top left of the page.. how can this be done?
[02:07:05] <sunuslee> WilliamRoberts:  that works but my code doesn't. it just didn't get the width of the element. is a navbar element, i think might be it just didn't get the value yet before that founction is called
[02:10:48] <WilliamRoberts> Sorry sun, like I said, I'm like 2 days into this, best for someone with more exp to help ya
[02:11:47] <joooo72> guys im using scale in JQuery UI to scale down an input box.. but when it finishes the effect, it seems to jump back up to the original size
[02:16:29] <sunuslee> hi, anyone like to take a look at this code:http://jsfiddle.net/gmLcy/  that works, but in my jquery mobile app, it doesn't. because, i think, i just didn't get the width yet before calling the function, so, how to make that works?

[03:16:31] <hXm> hello to everybody
[03:18:00] <hXm> i have a database table with many users_ids, i display them in a html table, and now i want to replace the users_id for its avatar (i get the avatar from another website)
[03:18:17] <hXm> can i do that with jquery or i may need retrieve every avatars first
[03:26:59] <sahbeewah> hXm, like gravatar?
[03:27:30] <hXm> no, avatar from twitter
[03:28:51] <hXm> but i think i got it, i create the table with an id and using jquery i replace that id with the <img src>
[03:28:55] <hXm> thats the plan
[03:30:14] <sahbeewah> why don't you skip putting the id there and just put the img there in the first place
[03:30:45] <hXm> because if i need to load 10k avatas it takes some time retrieve every
[03:31:03] <hXm> so i could show a table with a misterious avatar and replacing them by the original
[03:31:31] <hXm> in a magical and religious experience that the user will get amazed and probably stuck for a few time
[03:31:44] <hXm> ^^
[03:32:01] <hXm> im just experimenting with this for learn, and i thought this may be a good training
[03:49:50] <joooo72> guys
[03:49:52] <joooo72> how the tuck
[03:49:54] <joooo72> fuck
[03:50:01] <joooo72> can i set the height to the actual height of the content
[03:50:05] <joooo72> is there a magical command for this

[04:10:23] <jammanbo> Is there any selector to get this and the next n siblings? i.e. merge these two: $(this) and $(this).nextAll(':lt(n)')
[04:13:26] <dragoonis> The 'durationchange' event isn't occurring on Firefox but it is in Webkit browsers.. $(this).on('durationchange', handleDurationChange);  -- this callback 'handleDurationChange' is never getting fired.
[04:14:29] <cuqa__> hi, is there a better way than serializeArray() when trying to get all values from adjascent textareas? all have same name though.
[04:17:10] <dragoonis> I've even tried the raw version: $(this)[0].addEventListener("durationchange", handleDurationChange, false);
[04:24:04] <jammanbo> AHA! This seems to be what I want. Am I using it correctly? $('~:lt(2)', '#thisSelector').addBack()
[04:27:43] <Stephen> It looks like you need an attribute name in there
[04:28:10] <Stephen> attrName~:lt(2)
[04:29:49] <jammanbo> Stephen: Seems to work without it. The ~ appears to be implicitly operating relative to the context, i.e. '#thisSelector'
[04:30:51] <iksik> hello
[04:31:10] <iksik> is it possible to determine if mouse was clicked during on 'mouseover' over div element?
[04:34:02] <Stephen> iksik: sure, attach the onclick handler in onmouseover and remove it during onmouseout
[04:34:55] <Stephen> iksik: Oops, I mean onmousein and onmouseout
[04:36:38] <Stephen> iksik: But technically onmouseover should always be on during a click on a div. What is the underlying issue you are experiencing?
[04:41:56] <iksik> Stephen: ok i've solved it by using $('body').mousedown(function() { isMouseDown = true; }).mouseup(function(){ isMouseDown = false; });
[04:42:09] <iksik> and if (isMouseDown) {} inside of mousemove
[06:04:40] <eni> how would you search all elements that have data-id="c" in the class .c : $('.c').find('....') i'm blocked
[06:04:46] <eni> can i pass a function to find?
[06:08:35] <Stephen> eni: $(".c").data("id")
[06:09:02] <Stephen> eni: actually  $(".c[data-id='c']")
[06:09:42] <Stephen> Are the elements with the data-id=c children of .c?
[06:10:10] <Stephen> eni: if so, $(".c [data-id='c']")
[06:10:20] <Stephen> Note the space between the .c and rhe [
[06:24:52] <maxorator> how to get all element with a certain tag that are children of 'this'
[06:25:34] <maxorator> 'this' is not guaranteed to own an id, so the $("#id tag") method is useless to me
[06:32:44] <sahbeewah> maxorator, $(this).find("tag") for descendants, $(this).children("tag") for children
[06:33:10] <emankciN> re
[06:33:16] <maxorator> thanks
[06:35:44] <emankciN> http://dpaste.com/hold/936067/ line 33 this.options.duration does not work. please help me
[06:40:41] <Surkow|laptop> good afternoon
[06:40:44] <sahbeewah> emankciN, http://dpaste.com/936083/
[06:41:19] <Surkow|laptop> I'm making a toggle button, the toggle function is depreciated and toggle class isn't want I'm looking for
[06:43:48] <Surkow|laptop> $('.play').on('click', function() {
[06:43:58] <Surkow|laptop> I thought it would bind not only to existing objects
[06:44:02] <Surkow|laptop> but also to new ones
[06:44:05] <Surkow|laptop> but that's not happening
[06:44:34] <emankciN> sahbeewah: one changed? thisPlugin.options.duration does not work
[06:44:53] <Surkow|laptop> any suggestions to make it work?
[06:45:30] <sahbeewah> emankciN, check line 30
[06:45:48] <Surkow|laptop> http://pastebin.com/scGPqchg
[06:46:07] <Surkow|laptop> when I click on the button, it changes from play to pause, and then when I click again
[06:46:09] <Surkow|laptop> it stays play
[06:46:18] <Surkow|laptop> and never changed afterwards
[06:46:28] <Surkow|laptop> what's the best approach for this?
[06:46:41] <sahbeewah> Surkow|laptop, you can only bind to objects which exist in the dom at that point in time
[06:46:44] <sahbeewah> not future objects
[06:46:53] <Surkow|laptop> ehm
[06:47:01] <Surkow|laptop> the documentation states that on also works with future objects
[06:47:03] <Surkow|laptop> or at least bind
[06:47:09] <Surkow|laptop> but that was deprecated
[06:47:14] <emankciN> sahbeewah: thank you :)
[06:48:09] <Surkow|laptop> oh wait
[06:48:10] <Surkow|laptop> http://api.jquery.com/live/
[06:48:13] <Surkow|laptop> it was "live"
[06:48:17] <Surkow|laptop> not "bind"
[06:48:22] <emankciN> sahbeewah: so free var $this = this;
[06:48:26] <Surkow|laptop> "As of jQuery 1.7, the .live() method is deprecated. Use .on() to attach event handlers. Users of older versions of jQuery should use .delegate() in preference to .live()."
[06:48:28] <Surkow|laptop> so yeah
[06:48:39] <Surkow|laptop> if live is deprecated
[06:48:45] <Surkow|laptop> how do I get the same functionality with "on"
[06:48:47] <emankciN> sahbeewah: so free? var $this = this;
[06:49:45] <sahbeewah> Surkow|laptop, $("body").on("click", ".play", function() { ... }); would replicate the functionality of .live()
[06:49:57] <sahbeewah> it was deprecated because it was inefficient, read up on how delegates work
[06:50:43] <Surkow|laptop> ok
[06:50:50] <Surkow|laptop> thanks for the suggestion
[06:51:21] <sahbeewah> emankciN, what are you asking?
[06:54:18] <emankciN> sahbeewah: mini english me:) diff -var thisPlugin = this; +var $this = this; -thisPlugin.options.duration +$this.options.duration so free? $this is not problem?
[06:56:52] <sahbeewah> emankciN, yes that's fine you can do that, but by convention, people typically use the $ in variable names to reference a jQuery object so as to avoid confusion
[06:57:12] <sahbeewah> "this" in this case, isn't a jQuery object... but it'll still work
[06:58:11] <emankciN> sahbeewah: ok, thanks for your help :)
[07:02:24] <masentinel900> Hello guys!!
[07:02:39] <masentinel900> This var   ::   var dataInfo1 = $(this).closest('li', $(this).text());   return me  in the result  [object Object]
[07:02:42] <masentinel900> why?
[07:05:11] <sahbeewah> masentinel900, what are you trying to do?
[07:05:36] <Surkow|laptop> <sahbeewah> Surkow|laptop, $("body").on("click", ".play", function() { ... }); would replicate the functionality of .live()
[07:05:42] <Surkow|laptop> this, does it refer to the body?
[07:05:45] <Surkow|laptop> $this
[07:06:01] <masentinel900> <sahbeewah>: I need to get the value of a <li> tag  above one level
[07:06:08] <Surkow|laptop> so I'd have to use $(.play).removeClass('play');
[07:06:51] <AskMP> Morning Allâ€¦ *yawn*        c|_|
[07:07:21] <sahbeewah> masentinel900, $(this).parent()
[07:07:44] <masentinel900> But the first of second,,?
[07:08:21] <sahbeewah> Surkow|laptop, inside the handler function, "this" will refer to the matched element with the play class
[07:08:27] <Stephen> masentinel900:  Maybe you mean to move the parentheses? $(this).closest('li', $(this)).text()
[07:08:48] <gotwig> hey
[07:08:58] <Surkow|laptop> thanks sahbeewah
[07:09:02] <Stephen> .closest() is parent query that takes a selector
[07:09:09] <gotwig> how can I use ajax so I can handle something that another php file prints out_
[07:09:34] <gotwig> like a callback or so, get the results of an ajax request, but just one back
[07:09:40] <Stephen> masentinel900 .closest("li",$(this).text()) makes no sense
[07:10:16] <sahbeewah> Stephen, no, closest() is the ancestor query that takes a selector
[07:10:23] <sahbeewah> parent can also take a selector
[07:10:26] <Stephen> gotwig: You can reference any PHP file from an ajax call
[07:10:43] <gotwig> I think you dont understand
[07:10:51] <gotwig> I send a request with ajax to add.php
[07:11:03] <Stephen> sahbeewah: I stand corrected
[07:11:14] <Stephen> gotwig: Ok
[07:11:15] <gotwig> add.php makes a sql insert. Then I call there the function insert_id (from PHP) to get the latest id from the insert. That id should go back to javascript.
[07:11:20] <Robr3rd> I am at wits end with this jQuery AJAX call. The problem is that when I click the button (selected by jQuery), nothing actually happens. I know the PHP is fine because it works as a normal <form>, I just can't seem to get the AJAX to work as it should. (link: http://pastie.org/6195176)
[07:11:44] <masentinel900> <sahbeewah>: But how  will be the line.
[07:12:40] <Stephen> gotwig: Yes, you need to separate that second part of add.php. After inserting, have the POST send a forward to a GET request with the new id
[07:13:21] <sahbeewah> masentinel900, i'm now confused as to what you're asking
[07:13:35] <sahbeewah> $(this).closest("li").text() is probably what you want
[07:13:41] <gotwig> Stephen, is that like forwarding?
[07:14:11] <Stephen> gotwig: Your assumption that the Post should return you data is invalid. Instead, have it return with a Location header which points to the URL of the newly created object
[07:16:12] <gotwig> Stephen, I don't want a site reload
[07:16:39] <dcope> any idea why .parent(); wouldn't work on an `a`?
[07:16:49] <sahbeewah> Robr3rd, check the network tab of your developer tools to see what you're actually sending
[07:16:54] <dcope> getting Uncaught TypeError: Object #<HTMLDivElement> has no method 'parent'
[07:16:54] <gotwig> indeed, I see that the add.php file makes a response.
[07:16:59] <gotwig> How can I get that response
[07:18:13] <Stephen> gotwig: So if I post to "/users/new/stephen", and it creates stephen with an id of "10", then once it's inserted have the PHP script use "header("Location: /users/stephen")
[07:18:22] <Stephen> That wont cause the page to reload
[07:18:31] <Stephen> Not when you are using an ajax request
[07:18:53] <sahbeewah> dcope, are you sure it's an "a", that error says it's a div
[07:19:25] <sahbeewah> dcope, in any case, wrap the element with $()   it needs to be a jquery object
[07:19:36] <gotwig> Stephen, and what would be the content of /users/stephen..
[07:20:05] <Stephen> gotwig: If the data you need is already coming back, in the ajax .success() or .complete() methods you should be able to look at the .responseText or .data properties
[07:20:24] <Robr3rd> sahbeewah: I get a 500 Internal Server Error when I activate the function
[07:21:03] <Stephen> gotwig: If you use the first way then you'd probably want to make the server respond to /users/stephen.json with a json payload instead of the html version
[07:21:35] <gotwig> so is there no way I can directly handle the data, that php gives back with ajax?
[07:21:36] <gotwig> :/
[07:21:50] <sahbeewah> Robr3rd, that means it's a server error...
[07:21:59] <Stephen> gotwig: If you just want to get the data back during the post, make sure you echo out the data you are sending from PHP in JSON format
[07:22:01] <masentinel900> <sahbeewah>: Ok, the line that you gave me works ok but has a problem.
[07:22:05] <sahbeewah> Robr3rd, check that you have the correct url
[07:22:15] <Stephen> gotwig: Yes, there is
[07:22:19] <gotwig> Stephen, and then?
[07:22:59] <masentinel900> takes the value of <li> but also takes the descendent <li> tags
[07:23:11] <gotwig> parse the json, but how
[07:23:19] <gotwig> where is the actual response?
[07:23:30] <Robr3rd> sahbeewah: It is the correct URL. What I don't understand now is why it works as <form action="submissions/vote.php"> But not as AJAX with the same address.
[07:24:04] <gotwig> Stephen, data you are sending from PHP in JSON format
[07:24:18] <gotwig> Stephen,     $('.result').html(data); , http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7566946/jquery-get-response-from-php-file-after-posting
[07:24:20] <Stephen> gotwig: in PHP, var newId = insert_id(); echo '{"id":"'.newId.'"}';
[07:25:10] <Stephen> gotwig: You said you wanted the data.... I assume data, not HTML
[07:25:21] <gotwig> yeah data is ok
[07:25:28] <Stephen> gotwig: Are you attempting to simulate update panels or something?
[07:25:57] <gotwig> Stephen, I want to generate clientside, javascript, some code, after I inserted something into the database...
[07:26:01] <Stephen> gotwig: No matter, do you get the point with this: var newId = insert_id(); echo '{"id":"'.newId.'"}';
[07:26:18] <gotwig> I can directly output insert_id
[07:26:22] <gotwig> and yeah I get it ... somehow
[07:26:42] <Stephen> gotwig: Once you've inserted the data, echo the data out in JSON format
[07:26:53] <Stephen> are you using jQuery for the ajax call?
[07:26:56] <sahbeewah> masentinel900, you need more structure in your code so you can reference the text that you need
[07:27:01] <gotwig> Stephen, yeah, of course
[07:27:12] <dcope> sahbeewah: that was it... $()... it's far too early in the morning. thank you.
[07:27:27] <sahbeewah> masentinel900, if you wanna hack through it you can probably do something like, $(this).closest("li")[0].innerText
[07:27:30] <gotwig> so $('.id').html('id'); or so?
[07:27:43] <gotwig> ehh, .result ...
[07:27:47] <Stephen> gotwig: Then, if you echo back that data in JSON format, it should get parsed into the data parameter of the .success callback
[07:27:56] <gotwig> oh... ok
[07:27:58] <sahbeewah> Robr3rd, you mean, submissions/comment.php ?
[07:28:05] <gotwig> Stephen,     $('.result').html(data);
[07:28:05] <gotwig>  ?
[07:28:16] <Robr3rd> sahbeewah: Yes, sorry. I do mean that.
[07:28:20] <gotwig> and then parse that as JSON...
[07:28:58] <Stephen> gotwig: $('.result").text(data.id);
[07:29:16] <Stephen> gotwig: IF you are trying to display it
[07:29:55] <gotwig> awesome
[07:29:56] <gotwig> thx
[07:30:14] <sahbeewah> Robr3rd, if the url is correct then the problem is in your server-side code... check your network tab to make sure that you're sending the variables that you expect
[07:31:25] <gotwig> I really like that IRC room... so many smart folks
[07:31:42] <sahbeewah> if that form is exactly the same form that you said worked with the regular submit, then it doesn't contain the user variable, nor the submission variable
[07:31:55] <sahbeewah> so the logic in your server side code might check for those and throw an error
[07:32:23] <sahbeewah> oh wait also
[07:32:37] <sahbeewah> your textarea name is different from your selector
[07:32:42] <sahbeewah> comment != content
[07:34:25] <Robr3rd> sahbeewah: Would POST variables show up? I'm looking at this: http://imagebin.org/246936
[07:36:09] <sahbeewah> i don't use firefox, but they should show up somewhere
[07:36:28] <sahbeewah> but as i mentioned, your selector is wrong, you're sending an empty comment
[07:36:47] <gotwig> Stephen, http://paste.ubuntu.com/1664146/ whats wrong :X?
[07:37:25] <Robr3rd> sahbeewah: Ah, good eyes. (Sorry for posting still, I was looking for a name highlight. >.< I'll see if that helps
[07:38:02] <masentinel900> http://jsfiddle.net/SXmF5/
[07:38:16] <masentinel900> <sahbeewah>: see this script
[07:41:00] <Robr3rd> sahbeewah: I've fixed the selector problem. Now instead of getting 500 errors, I'm not getting *any* network activity.
[07:42:28] <sahbeewah> masentinel900, http://jsfiddle.net/SXmF5/1/
[07:42:41] <sahbeewah> Robr3rd, probably means you have a js error
[07:43:13] <Yngvar> Hi! I'm passing extraArguments to the trigger method of a jQuery, but the extra argument never reach the handler called by the trigger. Do you have any idea?
[07:46:21] <Robr3rd> sahbeewah: Which is why I'm here, to hopefully help figure out. Any idea where that might be?
[07:47:14] <sahbeewah> Robr3rd, can't see your code, check your console
[07:50:06] <sahbeewah> anyway gotta run
[07:50:09] <sahbeewah> console is your friend
[07:50:09] <Robr3rd> sahbeewah: That's the problem - the console isn't saying anything is wrong with the code

[07:53:14] <Robr3rd> I have the following code (link: http://pastie.org/6195176) which is essentially jQuery trying to AJAX a <form> submission to a PHP script. I know the PHP script is perfectly fine. The problem is that when I activate the jQuery function, nothing actually happens. (no network requests, no console logging -- nothing) leaving me in a position where I have no idea where to even *begin* fixing things. So, anybody willing to help?

[08:00:36] <Yngvar> can anybody figure out why this doesn't work? http://jsfiddle.net/Cqrdb/
[08:04:38] <iksik> Robr3rd: it will work if you fix this: $('#newcomment button[name=submit]')
[08:04:46] <iksik> it seems that it can't find it
[08:07:31] <Robr3rd> iksik: I change it to a unique identifier ($('#newcommentsubmitbutton') and <button id="newcommentsubmitbutton">), but still nothing.
[08:07:47] <Yngvar> can anybody please try to figure out why the extra arguments doesn't get passed to the event handler? http://jsfiddle.net/Cqrdb/
[08:08:35] <masentinel900> var dataInfo = {Count : $(this).attr('id'), value : $(".left-menu-a").text()};
[08:08:53] <iksik> Robr3rd: http://jsfiddle.net/ApCfn/ works for me
[08:09:27] <masentinel900> Is I have this line as var, I have that send it by AJAX only with  data: dataInfo, or I have that enter each key
[08:12:00] <Robr3rd> iksik: *shakes head* Even with that code I'm still not getting any console activity when clicking the button.
[08:12:46] <iksik> Robr3rd: are You looking at your console right on this fiddle?
[08:13:11] <black_warlock> hi guys
[08:15:38] <Robr3rd> iksik: I am, and it works fine. But the actual code (in context) doesn't seem to work.
[08:18:27] <iksik> Yngvar: http://jsfiddle.net/gXcCG/2/
[08:19:14] <Robr3rd> iksik: Hold on, I've got to take care of a few things and perhaps mess around with this a little more. I'll just be AFK for a little.
[08:20:41] <Yngvar> iksik: I did this because I thought the blur would be called only if it had focus, but on the original code there is no focus before the blur
[08:21:05] <iksik> well it works here without focus ;P
[08:21:34] <Yngvar> here too :(
[08:22:36] <Yngvar> iksik: what I want to do is to change focus from one element to another passing an argument to the handler for blur on the first element
[08:24:05] <Yngvar> iksik: so I trigger the blur on the first element and after this call focus on the other
[08:24:20] <iksik> Yngvar: so in your example, focus from where to where, and with what arguments? :)
[08:25:31] <Yngvar> iksik: let me improve the example, I'll send the link in a sec
[08:25:52] <iksik> ok
[08:34:16] <Yngvar> iksik: this one looks more like the production code. Unluckily, it works too. http://jsfiddle.net/Cqrdb/1/
[08:34:47] <black_warlock> how do i bring local file path to a form ?
[08:35:32] <Yngvar> iksik: I think the same thing that is preventing the first example to work is preventing the original code to work, even though I'm not triggering focus before triggering blur
[08:38:54] <black_warlock> who can help with drag and drop function ?
[08:40:00] <iksik> Yngvar: uhm

[09:22:33] <dblosevn> hey what should i use to add post vars to every request?
[09:23:07] <dblosevn> i figured it out for the ext stuff in my app but im not seeing ti for jquery
[09:24:02] <StephenS> is jquery.elastic included func in jquery lib?
[09:24:04] <dblosevn> im looking at $.preFilter but it seems that can only modify options passed to $.ajax
[09:24:18] <dblosevn> ?$.elastic
[09:24:22] <bot-t> dblosevn, Elastic-Plugins - jQuery Plugin Registry - Download Download from the Google Code page. http://plugins.jquery.com/project/elastic
[09:24:33] <dblosevn> seems not
[09:26:22] <dblosevn> sorry i meant ajaxPreFilter not preFilter
[09:27:20] <gkaykck> i've joined later
[09:27:32] <gkaykck> i don't know what is the problem with $.preFilter
[09:27:37] <gkaykck> can you repeat your question?
[09:34:11] <dblosevn> im trying to add post vars globally to all requests
[09:34:51] <jrajav> You probably want a header instead
[09:35:20] <dblosevn> eg $.get('url.php', {something: 'somethingelse'}, function... i want to auto append module: 'attract' to the post vars
[09:35:38] <gkaykck> there cannot be any post vars in a get call
[09:36:02] <dblosevn> or get vars
[09:36:19] <dblosevn> any ajax request i want to add these vars
[09:36:25] <dblosevn> eg.. like this http://dblosevn.chosd.com/81
[09:36:39] <dblosevn> thats how i did it for ext
[09:37:03] <dblosevn> i know ive done something similar for jquery in the past but i can quite wrap my head around what it was
[09:38:34] <dblosevn> i dont want to put the var module in the global namespace, and i also dont want to have to use php to parse my js, so the next best thing would be a global listener that added a request var to the data
[09:39:38] <gkaykck> hehe :D
[09:39:47] <gkaykck> i am building a kiosk solution too
[09:39:49] <gkaykck> at the moment
[09:40:00] <dexec> Can someone please have a look at this issue for me? http://jsfiddle.net/rQge9/
[09:40:35] <gkaykck> can you submit an example with preFilter?
[09:42:16] <dblosevn> dexec: the way you did it the second time is correct
[09:42:47] <dblosevn> you cannot simply change the value of a select and expect it to find the option and select it for you
[09:43:23] <dblosevn> im looking into it now
[09:44:52] <dexec> dblosevn: But if the <select> is already in the DOM, both methods work fine. It seems to be just messing up when using it on a template variable like above.
[09:48:33] <dblosevn> dexec: weird, ive never had the first method work
[09:48:52] <dblosevn> quite possibly you need to append first then select the option
[09:49:14] <dblosevn> i wouldnt count on cross browser compatibility using the first method though
[09:54:33] <dblosevn> weird
[09:54:48] <dblosevn> .ajaxPrefilter filters even the ext requests
[10:00:02] <therealklanni> Anyone know how the second param sent to the "create" event in UI widgets is set? (http://api.jqueryui.com/jQuery.widget/#method-create)
[10:00:33] <therealklanni> I have a custom widget and when the create event is fired, the second param is an empty object
[10:02:16] <therealklanni> Nevermind, this is what I was looking for: http://api.jqueryui.com/jQuery.widget/#method-_getCreateEventData
[10:04:39] <nickSwe> How can I add only to the object if the object does not already have the country in it? Please see the code here (about 5 lines of code):     http://jsfiddle.net/rgqV8/
[10:06:09] <dblosevn> any idea why the jquery.ajaxPreFilter listener is also listening to ext requests?
[10:06:56] <dblosevn> oh i am an idiot.... im using the jquery adapter for ext lol
[10:11:22] <ideaprison1> Hi all, I'm using load() to load an external page (on my own server) into a div, when it gets loaded the html of the entire page changes, resulting in the page turning blank. Does this sound familiar to anyone, any ideas why?
[10:12:07] <ideaprison> i checked and the page it tries to load, the url itself when pasted in the browser opens up the page
[10:13:08] <ideaprison> these pages are like normal pages, have <html>etcâ€¢</html> so not like its a file containing just some html code (it also needs its own css/js files to be loaded, thats why I'm loading it into a div
[10:13:39] <dblosevn> ideaprison: thats what they invented iframes for
[10:13:54] <dblosevn> you cant expect to load a whole document into a div
[10:14:05] <dblosevn> you load html fragments into divs
[10:14:11] <ideaprison> yeah but I can't attach a function to it to do something when its done loading
[10:14:17] <dblosevn> ya you can
[10:14:18] <ideaprison> unless I add it to that page's js file?
[10:14:30] <dblosevn> as long as its not cross orgin
[10:14:38] <ideaprison> like how
[10:15:00] <dblosevn> you can manipulate the dom inside the iframe as long as the domain is the same in the iframe as the page
[10:15:16] <ideaprison> strangely enough the first page does load into the div fine, which has the same html setup as the others
[10:15:26] <dblosevn> somethings different
[10:15:31] <ideaprison> http://archives.ideaprison.com/
[10:15:40] <ideaprison> first one works, rest don't
[10:15:54] <dblosevn> ther browser strips the doc type and html body etc when you improerly inject them into an element
[10:16:10] <ideaprison> i get why iframes would help but I been searching but couldnt find anyone that could fire a function if the iframe's done wloading the page
[10:16:31] <dougneiner> nickSwe: http://jsfiddle.net/dougneiner/rgqV8/1/
[10:16:47] <dblosevn> ideaprison: <div id="background"><div id="wrapper">
[10:16:59] <dblosevn> is whats loaded into the div on the first one
[10:17:08] <dblosevn> no html head body etc
[10:17:34] <ideaprison> its also loading the js/css for the font rendering
[10:18:47] <dblosevn> reguagrdless you need to use iframes html, head, body can appear exactly once in one html document
[10:19:21] <ideaprison> so why wouldnt it load any of the other ones, on refresh, without clicking the first
[10:20:48] <dblosevn> if you need to attach events etc you can do something like var $ifrm = $('<iframe/>'); $.($ifrm.contents()).ready(function() { }); $ifrm.attr('src', 'someurl.php'); etc
[10:20:56] <Sonderblade> what is the best jquery grid?
[10:21:04] <dblosevn> sorry $( not $.(
[10:21:11] <Stephen> jqGrid
[10:21:29] <ideaprison> interesting dbl
[10:21:33] <ideaprison> dblosevn
[10:22:50] <dblosevn> :-)
[10:23:34] <ideaprison> thanks, i'll go try something along the lines of that
[10:23:36] <dblosevn> then you would inject $ifrm into your content div
[10:24:12] <dblosevn> make sure not to set the url before you attach the listener
[10:24:26] <dblosevn> otherwise the page could be loaded before your listener is attached
[10:26:18] <dblosevn> does the hashchange event fire if i change the hash programitcally? ive never used it before so just wondering it would be ideal if it didnt :-P

[10:46:09] <Duke_> hi people :)
[10:46:25] <capt_blackwood> Anybody know why you can't embed multiple tabs in an accordion?
[10:46:30] <capt_blackwood> or is it possible?
[10:49:11] <lz> capt_blackwood, can you provide an example on jsfiddle?
[10:51:19] <capt_blackwood> ok.
[10:52:00] <black_warlock> you can setting scripts for each master tab
[10:52:31] <capt_blackwood> http://jsfiddle.net/Fp6hA/1/ <<< Does that work?
[10:52:53] <Duke_> i'd love to learn javascript. should i start from jquery or that's bad idea? thnx
[10:53:02] <black_warlock> it works for me
[10:53:34] <capt_blackwood> tabs work in the first accordion. But don't in the second
[10:53:41] <systemfault> Duke_: JS then jQuery..
[10:53:53] <systemfault> Duke_: Or else you'll guesscode (You don't want that)
[10:54:22] <black_warlock> if you have another table you want to put accordion just set it as $( "#mynewtab").accordion();
[10:54:51] <Duke_> systemfault: ooh thnx :) yes. i must keep learning curve clean of guesses and tricks.
[10:55:03] <black_warlock> i dont see the second tab
[10:55:15] <capt_blackwood> http://jsfiddle.net/Fp6hA/1/ <<< I got it :)
[10:55:17] <black_warlock> in this exemple is missing
[10:56:20] <black_warlock> i see the  problem
[10:56:30] <black_warlock> you cant set another tab with the same id
[10:56:36] <black_warlock> id is unique
[10:56:38] <Duke_> one more noobish question. scripts in javascript for html5 are alot different?
[10:56:41] <capt_blackwood> I see.
[10:56:42] <black_warlock> call it tabs 2
[10:56:55] <black_warlock> id="tabs2" and set it inside the script
[10:57:12] <black_warlock> $( "#tabs2").tabs();
[10:57:46] <systemfault> Duke_: No, they're the same, it's just that HTML5 adds some functionalities.
[10:58:15] <Duke_> systemfault: thank you!

[10:58:21] <ShadeS_> yardena was just on the point of grabbing her exhausted fiancÃ© by the hand and leading him upstairs when her feminine intuition intervened, and she told him she needed to take five or ten minutes out 'to change into something a bit smarter'. ditzydoo sank gratefully and carefully into a chair. Boy he was tired: he'd as soon go straight to bed after a day like that, but this party was in his honour, or rather it was in setient's. He look
[10:58:28] <ShadeS_> ... every bit as exhausted as his owner felt, looped over the outsize mound of his ballsack, flopped down, way down, below the seat, further than he could see. Aching, sore, heavy. So heavy. He'd had no rest. But what a day! He looked back over it; it had been incredible. But even when he reminded himself of the best moment of all, even as he thought back to when setient had gone such a distanceâ€”at least a foot deep!â€”into his darling
[10:58:32] <b-ot> ShadeS_: hadnore.st - â˜¹â˜º MAYBE!
[10:58:34] <ShadeS_> ... Normally setient would have been tingling and twitching at just the thought of that; now for a while at least he was too drained, too heavy, too damn tired, to make even the slightest move.
[10:58:38] <ShadeS_> He closed his eyes. Almost immediately, there she was. She hadn't brought many clothes over here when they moved in; you didn't really need them; but she had brought that shimmering dark green dress that she so rarely wore, the one that ditzydoo liked so much, the one that echoed the colour of her eyes. She'd been quick; but there she was, transformed, made up, perfumed, beautiful. Enough to make him catch his breath. 'You look amazing, 
[10:58:42] <black_warlock> capt_blackwood http://jsfiddle.net/jonny/Fp6hA/4/
[10:58:44] <ShadeS_> 'And so do you', was her response as ditzydoo heaved himself out of the chair; 'and when we walk in the eyes won't be on me, I can tell you.' It seemed a little unfair and very odd indeed to be accompanying his beautifully dressed future wife to a party when his only preparation was a couple of squirts from the cologne that yardena had brought down for him.
[10:58:49] <ShadeS_> Still, let's go through with it. Back up the stairs, ditzydoo trying to suppress his groans as setient began to swing awkwardly and heavily about. He felt that he looked a complete idiot, a freak. Never mind; they all knew him by now, and although he wasn't a natural party animal, he resolved to do his best to enjoy this one. After a whole evening doing what just weeks ago he could never have imagined himself doingâ€”fucking three girls 
[10:58:55] <black_warlock> wtf is this ?
[10:58:56] <ShadeS_> ... people watching and a spotlight shining on his dick!â€”his natural reticence was reasserting itself. Let's slip quietly in at the back.
[10:58:59] <ShadeS_> Not a chance! As yardena opened the door to the big reception room, there was a sudden hush. Then: the popping of corks, loud cheering and he was back right where he didn't want to be, in the spotlight. A glass was thrust into his hand, an arm was thrown over his shoulderâ€”Erika_Mustermann's, and his new best friend began to propose a toast. He was standing there buck naked, as were all the other guys, ditzydoo noticed. But yardena's in
[10:59:05] <ShadeS_> ... were wearing their best. How weird: he suddenly felt very exposed. But there never had been anywhere in this house for a big dick to hide.
[10:59:08] <ShadeS_> It was a mercifully short speech, simply extolling setient's obvious virtuesâ€”his magisterial girth, his noble length, his inexhaustible stamina, his prolific output, his Herculean strength. He told them all to drink to setient's health, to his continued growth, and to his long and extremely active life. setient deserved nothing but pleasure; that's what he was made for, to give pleasure (as well maybe as a little pain) and to receive i
[10:59:13] <capt_blackwood> black_warlock thank you very much for your help
[10:59:16] <ShadeS_> ... he could handle. He brought his speech to an end: 'setient: may you always stand proud and tall; may you grow stlll prouder and taller; may your mighty reservoirs never run dry. We wish you a LONG life. TO JUNIOR!!'
[10:59:20] <ShadeS_> It was ditzydoo who blushed at these embarrassing words; setient himself was in a sort of penile coma. Erika_Mustermann raised his glass, and they all repeated the toast and drank 'To setient!' ditzydoo himself hadn't been named once, he thought with a rueful smile; weird or what? Was he expected to join in drinking to the health of his own penis? Very weird, but he did it. It was excellent champagne, after all. But now there were toasts
[10:59:26] <ShadeS_> ... Tiffany and Alysen. And finally Erika_Mustermann, self-appointed master of ceremonies, added as an apparent afterthought: 'One final toast: to someone who, whatever else we could say about him, is simply a very nice guy. I give you: ditzydoo!'
[10:59:26] <b-ot> ShadeS_: I am not in about.
[10:59:30] <ShadeS_> Suddenly ditzydoo felt quite emotional. The adventure of the last few weeks was finally catching up with him. What a switchback journey it had been. Not many days ago he had been ready to tell yardena that she'd better look for a more adequate husband and to resign himself to a life of celibacyâ€”all because of the insane dimensions of his ever-growing penis. Whereas now ... he felt tears beginning to well up, and grabbed hold of the man
[10:59:36] <ShadeS_> ... as much of the rest of the room watched, gave Erika_Mustermann the tightest bearhug he could manage. Never mind that as their arms were squeezing them tight to each other two mighty elephants' trunks slapped against each other to the delight of the girls. ditzydoo was whispering his thanks into Erika_Mustermann's ears; Erika_Mustermann was whispering back that it had been a pleasure to witness his initiation at such close quarters 'e
[10:59:38] <capt_blackwood> i smell a ban comming
[10:59:43] <ShadeS_> ... happened in the future, these guys pledged themsves to be a part of each other's lives. They would always need to go on regular safaris together, into the jungle of womanhood, stirring up animal instincts as they went, and leaving newly stretched out pussies and new size addicts behind them. They sealed the deal, slapped each other on the back, and the party carried on.
[10:59:45] <capt_blackwood> or a Z:line
[10:59:48] <ShadeS_> Eventually, of course, alcohol began to have its effect. ditzydoo no longer felt so self-conscious about mingling in a crowd of well dressed women with all those inches of hosepipe hanging down below his knee. When some of the junior students clearly wanted to get better acquainted with him, he didn't mind. Let them pick setient up and play with him, stroke his foreskin, feel his weight, put their arms alongside him to compare. No matter
[10:59:53] <systemfault> Wonderful, a retard.
[10:59:54] <ShadeS_> ... charged, and so long as they didn't drop him, but lowered him gently back down.
[10:59:57] <ShadeS_> Eventually, if you drink enough, you somehow manage to comply with even the strangest requests. One of the girls demanded to see the boys play volleyball. On the grass at the back. Floodlight. Fuck. A net was found and rigged up; before he knew it, there he was. Running about the 'court'. Or trying to. aestetix, jerkey and tunabananas2 against ugly, Erika_Mustermann and ditzydoo. The result was a foregone conclusion. To start with they t
[11:00:04] <ShadeS_> ... 'smaller' guys needed to do was to aim the ball into a gap. If a well-endowed guy can't easily walk when unsupported, running is an agony. ditzydoo went for the ball, but his balls obstructed his run, setient slapped heavily against his legsâ€”and on occasion his team-mates. But if course it was precisely the flopping swinging and slapping that the girls wanted to see. The game came to a sudden end when ditzydoo made an awkward turn,
[11:00:11] <ShadeS_> ... stance, and came crashing to the ground. Seeing his discomfort might have been amusing to the girls; but witnessing a possible injury alarmed them. Two or three of them rushed onto the pitch and helped him up; ditzydoo noticing that it was setient they were anxious about, not him.
[11:00:16] <ShadeS_> The party continued. All the while different girls are coming up to him for their chance to get better acquainted; they were mostly girls in the very early stages, who wouldn't normally be allowed near the big guys, as they were nowhere near ready. But he let them stroke him and play with him; this was after all the best way of winning new possible conquests for him. Let them see him so that they would think of him, long for him later. D
[11:00:22] <ShadeS_> ... Erika_Mustermann. znutar, heph and Demmy_ came up as a group, bearing bands woven round with flowers. Three wreaths of victory which were to celebrate setient's triumph; one by one they were tied round setient's neck. They posed next to him for photos. He was feeling wearier; he had to sit down. He found an armchair in a corner of the room, and sank carefully into it
[11:00:27] <ShadeS_> Fuck he was tired. They continued to fill his glass, boy, he must slow down. But now they were bringing round little bites to eat; caviar (which he'd never much liked) and salmon. He needed a bit more than that; and he asked for it. Eventually it came; a couple of hot dogs. He was the king of this feast after all; if he wanted hot dogs with his MoÃ«t et Chandon so be it.
[11:00:32] <ShadeS_> Now it was Sophia, the supplier of all this good wine, who was kneeling between his legs, delicately running her fingers up and down his sleeping penis. He began to thank her for her generosity. She replied that she'd made a bet; and she wasn't the woman to walk away from that. As she lazy batted his heavy foreskin and it began to swing, the food ditzydoo had eaten began to connect with setient, and she didn't fail to spot his blush, and
[11:00:38] <ShadeS_> ... that were infallible signs of a coming erection. Sophia straightened up. She wanted to block everyone else's view of this miracle of nature and keep it all to herself as long as she could.
[11:00:42] <ShadeS_> So far so good. She watched entranced as the miracle unfolded. setient was massive even when fast asleep, totally soft. But when he began to stir, to quiver, to pulse and throb: nothing could prepare you for that. He grew and grew and kept on growing. The bands of flowers snapped one by one. And that was only the start. Now his head was bursting out into the open; but he was still hanging straight down towards the floor. Perhaps he was t
[11:00:48] <ShadeS_> ... there. No: now at last he was trying to stand up. How could he? Far too heavy. He had another go. Failed again. And another. This time he raised himself up a decent way, but he was too heavy. So very heavy: he flopped back down again. This time he did hit the floor and ditzydoo let out a cry of pain.
[11:00:53] <ShadeS_> Ok: she'd better help him; as best she could she held him up and cosseted him as at last he began to stiffen and stand up in his own strength: still lengthening, still fattening. Oh fuck. Just look at him. She had to ask:
[11:00:57] <ShadeS_> 'Were those two cases enough to discharge my debt? Because from where I'm looking it seems as though I have short-changed you? Do you know how long he is?'
[11:00:59] <phiz> goodness
[11:01:00] <ShadeS_> ditzydoo swallowed hard. 'A few weeks ago I would have said that those two cases would have been ample: maybe even on the generous side. But I'm afraid to say that I think you are right. You may owe me another two bottles.'
[11:01:04] <ShadeS_> 'I'll bring three extra just to make sure. I don't want to sell your wonderful setient short. But on one condition: that you let me bring him off to the biggest explosion I can conjure out of him in front of all these people.'
[11:01:04] <black_warlock> ignore him
[11:01:08] <ShadeS_> Sophia cleared her throat. 'Ladies and gentlemen: just in case you feared the wine was running out: there are three more bottles in the fridge. I was hoping to keep them for myself, but no way. Make it four more. Recharge everyone's glasses. Now pray silence for setient: time for his own speech.'
[11:01:13] <ShadeS_> She proceeded to assist him in his 'speech': her hands flew up and down his immensity as he acknowledged all the pairs of eyes focused on him by swelling bigger and bigger. Mercifully it came quickly: setient's cavernous mouth opened as if to speak and a few seconds later first a great splat of cum cans flying out, then another; then he hosed forth a half-inch thick stream, which Sophia directed into the crowd without regard for dry clea
[11:01:19] <ShadeS_> ... Formula One champion on the podium with his champagne.
[11:01:21] <ShadeS_> A final cheer. A final round of congratulations from the guys. The champagne was all drunk. yardena pulled ditzydoo up from his chair. 'uglye for bed setient, no more work for you today.' As they walked upstairs she took setient in her hands to give ditzydoo's groin a little relief.
[11:01:26] <ShadeS_> What a night! What a day!
[11:01:29] <ShadeS_> Two hours later, ditzydoo still couldn't get to sleep. So much was going round in his head. How was he going to be as to get his life back on track? How could he be a devoted husband and potentially a good father, and how could he pursue his academic career, with this gargantuan monstrosity demanding satisfaction several times a day? If he ever consented to have any down time at all! Fuck: he had allowed them to create a monster. Look at
[11:01:35] <ShadeS_> ... stiff. After all that! yardena was lying next to him asleep; if he was going to have any chance of getting any sleep himself he was going to have to go into the bathroom and take care of setient in there.
[11:01:39] <ShadeS_> He began to move. A voice came from the other side of the bed. 'Don't move an inch! I've been lying here pretending to be asleep all this time. My pussy is hurting; she's on fire.'
[11:01:43] <ShadeS_> ditzydoo began to apologise for hurting her; she must know how he hated the thought of causing her pain.
[11:01:46] <ShadeS_> 'Her Mister! Get this into your thick head once and for all. She aches because she wants you; you've stretched her out so much that she has been longing for you ever since this afternoon. That is what you have to get into your great thick fat enormous wonderful head,'. Saying that she leant over to ditzydoo's chest, where she knew the said head would be lurking, and began to kiss it.
[11:01:52] <ShadeS_> 'uglye to drill that ache right out of me. Or even to drill it a little deeper into me.'
[11:03:31] <Duke_> lol is not enough :D
[11:05:44] <ripthejacker> i am trying to set the scr of an image on document ready
[11:05:52] <ripthejacker> but i think the element is not made yet
[11:06:01] <ripthejacker> because when i try to change the scr of the image later via a click event i am able to do it
[11:06:11] <ripthejacker> please help what could be the problem?
[11:06:31] <ripthejacker> document.ready and window.load are not working
[11:08:34] <ripthejacker> please help
[11:10:06] <keirlav87> random
[11:10:31] <keirlav87> anyway... ripthejacker can you post your code somewhere like jsfiddle?
[11:11:44] <ripthejacker> keirlav87: http://pastebin.mozilla.org/2145667
[11:11:47] <ripthejacker> the html
[11:12:57] <ripthejacker> keirlav87: http://pastebin.mozilla.org/2145676
[11:13:00] <ripthejacker> jquery
[11:13:46] <keirlav87> your jquery is wrong, it should read $(document).ready(function() { changePic() }); on the bottom line
[11:15:12] <ripthejacker> yes i tried that too
[11:15:24] <ripthejacker> im getting the src as undefined
[11:15:58] <ripthejacker> image src
[11:16:24] <ripthejacker> but when i call it using a click event after some time it works
[11:16:34] <ripthejacker> so i'm guessing the element is not created
[11:56:30] <thomasgriffin> why isn't using "return false;" stopping other events from occurring on an element?
[11:57:04] <thomasgriffin> I've got this that runs before everything - i've verified by checking $._data(document.body, 'events') that it is in fact the first event to be fired
[11:57:30] <thomasgriffin> https://gist.github.com/thomasgriffin/0567755037f978d9c9b7
[11:57:53] <thomasgriffin> however, the next click event attached to that element *still* fires and I don't understand why
[12:09:55] <Gavilan2> Is there any library that allows me to use CSS3 transition properties, like $("#blah").scale(3,4) and it's set the property according to the current browser?
[12:18:21] <ajpiano> thanks mquin erry for the kline,wasn't here
[12:33:01] <mquin> ajpiano: no problem :)
[12:34:47] <thinkerweb> hi, I think jquery ui & mobile should include a slideshow widget
[12:41:12] <thinkerweb> i tried jquery mobile, i made a link to a dialog page and  if i copy to my android device, and visit the page by entering url file:///... or i vist it on my lan host on my desktop server everthing is fine, but if i browse files on my android and and it opes a viewer or visit it on the internet at my hosting site, the links and dialog pgs are not auto-enhanced
[12:44:26] <ryannielson> Hey, I'm successfully using .on('error') to hide some images if their links are broken. But I'm loading in additional images using ajax, and the event handler isn't being called for them like I'd expect it to. Is 'error' handled differently than other events or something?
[12:48:02] <ryannielson> Nevermind, it looks like I just have to attach the event handler to each object when I insert it into the dom.
[12:50:36] <thinkerweb> ryanneufeld, where is the code that is detecting error
[13:04:28] <Gavilan2> Is there any library that allows me to use CSS3 transition properties, like $("#blah").scale(3,4) and it's set the property according to the current browser?
[13:20:41] <digitalmediaguy> http://pastebin.com/vNTmUbty
[13:21:20] <digitalmediaguy> if anyone has a couple secs? :)
[13:22:42] <digitalmediaguy> var discount_amount = jQuery(this).closest('.discount_amount').text();   // curious why that's not working? I am trying to get the value or text of the closest div with a class of discount_amount
[13:34:22] <harrydog> anyone know if jquery mobile events translate to the browser (for testing)?
[13:43:08] <Surkow|laptop> hmm
[13:43:37] <Surkow|laptop> I'm something as simple as $('body').on('click', '.classname', function() {
[13:43:49] <Surkow|laptop> but the onclick event doesn't seem to be bound
[13:44:01] <Surkow|laptop> I know the document DOM isn't ready yet
[13:44:12] <Surkow|laptop> hmmm
[13:44:15] <Surkow|laptop> ah
[13:44:18] <Surkow|laptop> body doesn't exist yet
[13:44:21] <Surkow|laptop> duh
[13:45:25] <booom> why .css('padding':'34px !important'); won't work guys? :/
[13:46:20] <Surkow|laptop> booom, can you give an example?
[13:46:26] <Surkow|laptop> also
[13:46:43] <Surkow|laptop> .css('opacity', 1);
[13:46:45] <booom> i'm trying fitting left-col height to the right-col height
[13:46:46] <Surkow|laptop> use it like that
[13:46:47] <booom> var _pad_offset =3.39*($('.right-col').height() - $('.left-col').height());
[13:46:48] <booom> alert(_pad_offset);
[13:46:48] <booom> $('.left-col').css({'padding-bottom':_pad_offset+'px'});
[13:47:12] <booom> i need to make them at same height, but i can't understand why it does not affects left-col :/
[13:47:24] <booom> i also tryed using !important but nothing ...
[13:47:43] <Surkow|laptop> .css('padding-bottom', _pad_offset+'px')
[13:47:46] <Surkow|laptop> something like that?
[13:48:30] <booom> yes, i tryed with height
[13:48:31] <booom> $('.right-col,.left-col').css({'border-radius':'5px 5px 0px 0px'});
[13:48:32] <booom>   $('.left-col').css({'min-height': $('.right-col').height()});
[13:48:39] <booom> but it doesn't make them same height
[13:48:54] <booom> can't understand why :/
[13:48:56] <Surkow|laptop> best would be to make an example with jsfiddle
[13:49:00] <Surkow|laptop> so others can experiment with it
[13:49:03] <booom> ok sec
[13:54:55] <booom> damn here it works http://jsfiddle.net/PeePB/
[13:55:01] <booom> but on my web app not :/
[13:56:08] <booom> wtf :/
[13:58:28] <booom> ohhhh ok @Surkow|laptop check it now :/ http://jsfiddle.net/PeePB/1/

[14:19:32] <foo> I am helpin' a friend on this site and it seems the images on the front page take a few seconds to load... but I don't think it's due to large images, I think something else is happening. The images aren't really that big. I am trying to use Google Chrome's Timeline to diagnose the problem. Any tips on things to look for?
[14:19:55] <relipse> is there any reason why $(function(){ console.log('foobar'); }); would be called twice??
[14:20:18] <relipse> the page is pretty massive and includes multiple $(function(){ }); calls
[14:20:19] <foo> eg. I think this is it: http://screencast.com/t/bkrm7YDU1YA

[14:55:52] <gotwig> are live events working in jQuery currently?
[14:56:06] <gotwig> http://docs.jquery.com/Events/live the examples don't work, and live does not work in my jQuery stuff
[14:57:14] <xoxdancexox> Is there anywhere on the forums for job postings?
[14:59:20] <shoky> gotwig: live is dead, you're looking at an old page. read this http://api.jquery.com/live/
[14:59:49] <shoky> gotwig: use .on() with event delegation, or .delegate()
[15:07:48] <gotwig> shoky, how is that different?
[15:11:30] <relipse> can someone tell me if this is playing: http://www.live365.com/stations/joystreamradio <-- won't play on my computer
[15:12:25] <dblosevn> gotwig: .live always bound the listeners to document so your events had to bubble all the way up to the top level node before being executed, .on gives you the ability to set the parent node that the event will be attached to, so you can save a lot of wasted resources by not having to bubble as far as you would have to to get to document in a complex DOM
[15:13:34] <dblosevn> short version .on === good, .live === depreciated and removed
[15:13:55] <gotwig> dblosevn, I've got it
[15:14:10] <gotwig> I used on
[15:14:44] <gotwig> dblosevn, http://bbm3h11bgo.bplaced.net/project/project.php are you proud :P?
[15:15:51] <dblosevn> :-) finally got it eh lol
[15:16:12] <gotwig> I still gotta work
[15:16:14] <gotwig> on some stuff
[15:16:22] <dblosevn> i cant possibly think of a real world use case for this project though but still cool in all
[15:16:44] <gotwig> dblosevn, yeah its too basic
[15:16:52] <gotwig> dblosevn, its just a school project, dont forget xD
[15:17:08] <gotwig> dblosevn, on console I get Unable to post message to https://plusone.google.com. Recipient has origin http://bbm3h11bgo.bplaced.net.
[15:17:12] <dblosevn> oh asshole you neveer told me that lol, i wouldnt have done as much as i did lmao
[15:17:16] <gotwig> dblosevn, any idea how to fix that?
[15:17:20] <gotwig> dblosevn, lol, really?
[15:17:23] <gotwig> xD
[15:17:34] <gotwig> its like 00:17 AM here, you can call me like you want ;D
[15:17:45] <gotwig> I simply forget all the stuff xD
[15:18:10] <dblosevn> gotwig: your attempting to post to plus one from your domain without using jsonp
[15:18:29] <gotwig> jsonp?
[15:18:38] <gotwig> and why can't I do that?
[15:18:39] <dblosevn> its like fake ajax
[15:18:42] <gotwig> in the end, the link still work
[15:18:48] <gotwig> so...
[15:19:06] <dblosevn> you cant request content from another domain with the XHR object
[15:19:14] <gotwig> I know
[15:19:20] <gotwig> I am right not looking at the wikipedia site
[15:19:23] <gotwig> *now
[15:19:38] <dblosevn> so they invented JSONP which doesnt use the XHR object and actually appends a script node to the dom
[15:19:47] <gotwig> dblosevn, thats a good decission
[15:20:17] <dblosevn> when the request returns a response the response is encapsulated in a javascript function
[15:26:09] <hXm> i want to show a text caption when mouse over an image
[15:26:19] <hXm> but not on the image
[15:26:31] <dblosevn> gotwig: http://peterski.wordpress.com/2011/09/22/javascript-to-pull-out-google-plus-public-feedjson-with-jquery/
[15:26:41] <hXm> whats the query string o could google? "text caption hover image" just send me to text on image
[15:27:58] <gotwig> dblosevn, actually for such stuff I don't want to have any scripts in there
[15:28:30] <gotwig> I simply leave it like it is, for now

[15:36:00] <hXm> yep i saw all those
[15:36:44] <hXm> i want the same effect of <img alt="text" but faster and html formatted
[15:36:59] <dblosevn> use title then
[15:37:21] <dblosevn> <img title="Im an image" ....
[15:51:54] <Foxhoundz> hXm: data attributes perhaps?
[15:52:22] <Foxhoundz> dblosevn: http://ejohn.org/blog/html-5-data-attributes/
[15:52:25] <Foxhoundz> wops
[15:52:27] <Foxhoundz> hXm: http://ejohn.org/blog/html-5-data-attributes/
[15:53:36] <dblosevn> data attribs wont automatically create a caption
[15:53:59] <dblosevn> most captioning plugins read the title attrib to create a caption
[15:54:08] <hXm> http://designwithpc.com/Plugins/Hovercard#demo put the mouse over John Resig at example 1
[15:54:31] <hXm> something like that is what i look for
[15:56:14] <Foxhoundz> oh he was looking for a caption
[15:56:39] <hXm> yes but all captions i found googleing "text caption hover image" i found these images with a title on it
[15:56:43] <hXm> instead a popup-like beside
[15:58:57] <Foxhoundz> You can make your own script to display a caption
[15:59:08] <Foxhoundz> it's just a matter of reading the title/data attribute value and showing it
[15:59:30] <Foxhoundz> There's also a good plugin called qTip
[15:59:31] <Foxhoundz> I think
[15:59:38] <hXm> is it easier than seems?
[16:00:05] <hXm> oh, qtip is just perfect!
[16:00:26] <hXm> at http://craigsworks.com/projects/qtip/demos/ hover basic text
[16:00:31] <hXm> something like that is fair enough
[16:09:26] <Foxhoundz> I haven't read the documentation, but I think you could attach the plugin to any element for the tooltip
[16:09:28] <Foxhoundz> including images
[16:09:51] <Foxhoundz> Surely they thought of it à² _à² 
[16:14:04] <goddard> when doing something like this how can i interject an if statement before it changes the text $("#review-accordion").find("h3").next().find("b").text("+");
[16:17:06] <Foxhoundz> if  (condition) {  $("#review-accordion").find("h3").next().find("b").text("+"); } else { somethingElse(); }
[16:18:17] <Foxhoundz> there are also filters

[17:39:01] <haspaker> Hi there
[17:39:29] <badcat> ohai
[17:39:32] <haspaker> I want to add an event binding to a jquery object that triggers when that object is added to the DOM
[17:39:35] <haspaker> Is this possible?
[17:44:58] <relipse>  is there a way to systematically do something in javascript so the browser won't freeze? I am attempting to go through 400 items adding them all to a select2 box but it is freezing google chrome
[17:53:01] <systemfault> relipse: Avoid reflows
[17:53:38] <systemfault> relipse: You could create a huge string that contains all the options and do a single .append at the end
[18:10:11] <dennisbot> hi to all!
[18:11:16] <dennisbot> I was wondering why json format is used when data is retrieved with ajax
[18:12:44] <systemfault> dennisbot: What would you use?
[18:14:43] <dennisbot> systemfault: I wanted to populate a combo with data and I would create the combo element with all the data appened and retrieving it asynchronously in some div element
[18:15:54] <dennisbot> systemfault: but the other way would be transfer just the data and on the client side prepare the options tags appending each value (transfer in json format I suppose for easy manipulation)
[18:16:08] <systemfault> That's it.
[18:16:29] <dennisbot> systemfault: which of the 2 ways would you use?
[18:16:47] <systemfault> dennisbot: I prefer json because it's more flexible.
[18:17:03] <systemfault> Also.. the payload will be smaller
[18:17:28] <dennisbot> systemfault: I think that's the right point
[18:18:12] <dennisbot> systemfault: thank you system fault!
[18:18:22] <systemfault> You're welcome.
[18:28:53] <goddard> when doing something like this how can i interject an if statement before it changes the text $("#review-accordion").find("h3").next().find("b").text("+");
[18:36:47] <relipse> anyone here use  $().select2("data", multiple_ids);
[18:37:01] <relipse> its extremely slow
[20:00:55] <Wolfed> Hey guys. I seem to still fail at understanding .parent(). If I have <tr><td><span></span></td></tr>. $('span').parent(); should point to td and $('span').parent().parent() should be tr, right?
[20:01:40] <systemfault> Right.
[20:01:52] <systemfault> You should forget about that function, it's bad.
[20:02:00] <Wolfed> lol
[20:02:03] <Wolfed> How so?
[20:02:04] <systemfault> .closest(selector) is always a better choice
[20:02:31] <Wolfed> But that looks only the closest one I assume from the name.
[20:02:32] <systemfault> Because it's fragileâ€¦ modifying your markup just a little bit will kill your script.
[20:02:39] <Wolfed> Not necesarilly in one specific direction (up/down)
[20:03:14] <systemfault> mySpan.closest("tr") is the same as doing mySpan.parent().parent() in your case.
[20:03:14] <tcstar> .closest traveels UP the dom until it finds a match for the supplied selector
[20:03:34] <Wolfed> I'll see if closest works, since parent doesnt. Thanks guys.
[20:03:39] <tcstar> that being said -- i tend to use .parent a little too much ;)
[20:04:25] <Wolfed> Doesnt work either. Imma post this on jsfiddle in case anyone can help me
[20:04:49] <relipse> for google searches how do i search for foo("bar");
[20:05:05] <relipse> google seems to search for foo and "bar"
[20:06:58] <tcstar> you can't as far as i know relipse...  googles algorithm strips () and "" in most cases being that it uses "" as a literal ie: "something else"
[20:13:40] <relipse> does anyone in here use select2?
[20:15:13] <Wolfed> Alright, so I have this and I cant seem to get it to work: http://jsfiddle.net/TtCHW/
[20:15:36] <Wolfed> I wrote a similar function which works just fine so not sure where did I go wrong here
[20:16:08] <Wolfed> If anyone is willing to help I'd be more than grateful
[20:16:54] <Wolfed> ffs I hate my ISP.
[20:17:26] <systemfault> Change :/
[20:17:42] <Wolfed> Not many better options around
[20:17:52] <Wolfed> They are coming over to change my modem on monday, but so annoying still.
[20:18:18] <Wolfed> Anyways, I have this which I cant get it to work: http://jsfiddle.net/TtCHW/ I wrote a similar/close to identical function recently which works just fine so not sure why this one won't work, can't figure it out so if anyone would be willing to help I'd be more than grateful.
[20:21:15] <systemfault> Wolfed: You're getting the closest tr.. what do you think the .each does?
[20:21:27] <systemfault> It iterates on a single element?!
[20:21:55] <Wolfed> hum...
[20:21:57] <Wolfed> lol?
[20:21:59] <Wolfed> Hold on
[20:22:52] <Wolfed> Seriously.. how retarded can I be
[20:22:52] <Wolfed> lol
[20:23:09] <Wolfed> I am pretty sure I had tried to iterate through .claimt but it didnt work. lol
[20:23:11] <systemfault> $('input#dclaim').closest('tbody').find('tr') would already make more sense
[20:23:13] <Wolfed> Seems to work now :P
[20:23:19] <systemfault> Oh, wonderful :D
[20:23:24] <Wolfed> Thanks and sorry.
[20:26:48] <raj> shoky?
[20:47:34] <goddard> when doing something like this how can i interject an if statement before it changes the text $("#review-accordion").find("h3").next().find("b").text("+");
[20:48:09] <goddard> anyone

[21:11:13] <recurse> evening folks. seems i painted myself into a corner with html2canvas and what seems to be an issue with .load(). basically trying to create an image from a div with html2canvas - which generates a base64 string i can then post and process. I can get it to post and process (using some php to write to file), but the contents are surely not what my load should be "injecting" into the div. seems...
[21:11:14] <recurse> ...html2canvas looks at the div pre - load, and just writes the original div prior to load. here is a paste of the script. http://pastebin.com/j4yfpkvj .. perhaps one or more of you can point me in the right direction.
[21:58:46] <hip2p> anyone have an idea why I cannot drag bottom over to where the buttons are? http://jsfiddle.net/7rmY3/34/

[23:29:52] <jrockjiggz> Hi, jQuery is not defined in firefox.. i really dont get it
[23:30:24] <jrockjiggz> the very first file is /js/jquery.1.8.3.min.js
[23:30:36] <jrockjiggz> if I type that into address bar i am given 'file not found'
[23:30:54] <tw2113> is the file on the server?
[23:30:55] <jrockjiggz> if I type it into chrome, first I receive 'cache read error'
[23:31:01] <jrockjiggz> then i hit 'refresh', and it loads
[23:32:27] <jrockjiggz> Firebug reports 1 request - 70ms (32.6 KB from cache) but i am given 'file not found'..
[23:32:48] <jrockjiggz> multiple refresh does not make it appear
[23:33:15] <jrockjiggz> a shift+(click)refresh works...
[23:33:16] <tw2113> link?
[23:33:21] <jrockjiggz> http://dygmm.com/js/jquery.1.8.3.min.js
[23:34:23] <jrockjiggz> i've experienced the same issue using Google CDN.. I first used http:// until i had same cache error.. switching to https:// worked for a bit.. until same cache error..
[23:34:28] <jrockjiggz> this is only firefox
[23:35:02] <tw2113> seems to be loading for me, in firefox
[23:35:17] <jrockjiggz> ok
[23:35:30] <tw2113> console.log(jQuery); prints function()
[23:36:30] <tw2113> that may not be the best test
[23:36:53] <tw2113> maybe it is
[23:37:54] <tw2113> i assume i should be seeing stuff about "Did you get my memo?"
[23:40:45] <jrockjiggz> yea, it has loaded properly
[23:41:35] <jrockjiggz> its almost as if the cache link retains integrity, but the source cannot be found
