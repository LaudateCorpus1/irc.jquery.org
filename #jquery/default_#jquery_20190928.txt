[05:54:32] <weijunli> Im trying to use jquery to directly control the url bar, but im not able to  navigate to the url because it is a new browser session without history. Heres my code and error https://dpaste.de/KTJA - There is any way I can still use this feature but on a session without `history`?
[08:54:17] <thykka> weijunli, probably this: https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=301210

[16:17:35] <Jaka> I
[16:21:12] <Jaka> I tried to do a auto slide for jQuery ui (draggable) , no i get it to slide the slider but now the slider expects to be click how do i simulate this as clicked ans slides like a human will do. here is what i tried https://pastebin.com/raw/0pxzX2SJ
[21:35:46] <Stoot> Damn I'm stuck. How do I create this with jquery ? https://jsfiddle.net/jrknsm58/ I'm stuck with my appends()
[21:36:14] <robertmaxrees> I don't see any JS.
[21:36:24] <robertmaxrees> also: there's no "appends"
[21:36:55] <Stoot> .append() then
[21:37:09] <Stoot> appends is multiple :)
[21:37:20] <robertmaxrees> show us what you've got so far.
[21:37:56] <Stoot> no, I have some, but this is the output I need to have. My first input closes the whole shabang with an </input> and I wonder why, sec
[21:38:06] <robertmaxrees> erm
[21:38:23] <robertmaxrees> also: why do you have a div id="hidden"?
[21:38:27] <robertmaxrees> is that to hide those inputs?
[21:38:36] <Stoot> this is the last "test" https://jsfiddle.net/jrknsm58/1/
[21:38:51] <Stoot> yeah it's from an example to test a JS lib
[21:39:01] <robertmaxrees> so that's your first issue.
[21:39:03] <Stoot> I thought I simply could class hide them
[21:39:21] <Stoot> no it's not an issue, if it's hidden it's fine
[21:39:33] <Stoot> finetune can be done later on
[21:39:33] <robertmaxrees> it is - type="hidden"
[21:39:40] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/8hfojb2c/1/
[21:39:55] <Stoot> what is type hidden ?
[21:39:59] <robertmaxrees> a hidden input.
[21:40:01] <Stoot> there is no type hidden
[21:40:04] <robertmaxrees> an input that shouldn't be shown to the user.
[21:40:06] <robertmaxrees> there is.
[21:40:18] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/hidden
[21:40:25] <Stoot> no there is a div that is hidden
[21:40:29] <Stoot> with the input elements in it
[21:40:33] <robertmaxrees> why does it need to be a hidden div?
[21:40:38] <robertmaxrees> that's extra, unnecessary markup.
[21:40:49] <Stoot> for the test it's fine, please don't disucss it :)
[21:40:53] <robertmaxrees> wtf
[21:40:55] <robertmaxrees> lmao
[21:40:57] <robertmaxrees> 'kay.
[21:41:07] <robertmaxrees> second off - append is the wrong tool for 99% of what you're doing here.
[21:41:20] <Stoot> next please
[21:41:22] <robertmaxrees> you want to append either to whatever parent element this is all getting added to, or do insertAfter
[21:41:31] <robertmaxrees> alright, have fun with the 'tude :)
[21:41:32] <Stoot> oh indeed!
[21:41:33] <robertmaxrees> enjoy!
[21:41:45] <Stoot> insertafter I needed :)
[21:41:51] <Stoot> thanks
[21:42:05] <Stoot> you are bringing the question out of scope, I didn't ;)
[21:42:19] <robertmaxrees> I'm teaching you how to do things the right way :)
[21:42:25] <robertmaxrees> but hey, your perogative to not learn.
[21:43:55] <Stoot> I know but that was not the question, I have an example here I want to test building the html with jquery as it's easier in my test, the rest, if it works how I want, is what I change lateron/
[21:43:59] <Stoot> it's a wrapup
[21:44:10] <Stoot> from an example wrapup
[21:44:12] <robertmaxrees> lol
[21:44:31] <robertmaxrees> you're building bad habits and making extra work for yourself, but hey.  All good.
[21:44:36] <Stoot> whatever makes your weekend fun, I don't care
[21:44:41] <robertmaxrees> oh ffs
[21:44:49] <Stoot> didn't I say it's wrapup ? they can be dirty as hell, I don't care
[21:44:58] <robertmaxrees> "wrapup" doesn't mean anything to me.
[21:45:05] <robertmaxrees> and your attitude is getting kinda old :)
[21:45:08] <Stoot> then you might need to learn something more ;)
[21:45:09] <robertmaxrees> it's all good.  good luck!
[21:45:13] <Stoot> thanks!
