[00:04:52] <xdjuj__> QianChenglong can explain a little bit more your problem ?
[00:05:39] <xdjuj__> If you want to change the href of a <a href> then you can use jQuery("a.your_class").attr("href",something);

[00:33:17] <seba4> one question ...how could i do it in jquery if a need to replace some variable. Like string: "This is some text %{Date: l n E h:i:s}"
[00:33:46] <seba4> i know i can do it with .replace if i am searching just for one part..
[00:34:15] <seba4> how could i use regexp so string should have %{Date: }
[00:34:33] <seba4> and after read what is inside and change inside data to right output
[01:24:35] <amaroks> seba4: put them in array
[01:24:47] <amaroks> and do replace on each item in the array

[02:23:00] <Christiaaan> Any gurus here that can help me fix an error? "Uncaught TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'prettyPhoto'"
[02:23:28] <Christiaaan> The script file is loaded, if I put an alert at the top of the file it alerts me when I load the page.
[02:30:32] <Christiaaan> Nobody?
[02:31:32] <coldhead> Christiaaan: are you loading the scripts in the right order?
[02:31:40] <coldhead> jquery and then the prettyPhoto plugin?
[02:32:59] <Christiaaan> coldhead: I'm loading them using WordPress, using the wordpress wp_enqueue_script function
[02:33:26] <Christiaaan> it lets you set dependancies, so it should load jquery before the prettyPhoto script
[02:35:43] <sirionnn> I'm trying to move a project from jsFiddle to my actual website, and I'm running into some issues with a pretty standard plugin, jquery-cookie. It works fine on jsFiddle, but whether I link the plugin.js or literally copy/paste the code directly into my html between two script tags, I still get a "$.cookie is not a function" error
[02:36:41] <sirionnn> any ideas what might prevent a plugin from actually creating the function its supposed to create, without causing any syntax errors on the way?
[02:43:00] <joesavage> I've got some basic pane-switching functionality going on using CSS animations and the 'animationend' event (jQuery switches classes and stuff at the back), however things aren't working as expected when switching from pane 'A' for example, to pane 'B': http://jsfiddle.net/2MfXx/3/ -- Any help?
[02:45:10] <sadtaco> .. I'm terrible at regex. I want to match "start everything in between end" in "not this start everything in between end and not this".  I figured something like .match( /^start+.*+end$/g ) but that's not doing it and I'm not sure what else to look at.
[02:46:38] <Caelum> sadtaco: can you be more specific about what you want to match
[02:49:18] <GoSox> sadtaco: maybe this well help?
[02:49:19] <GoSox> http://www.whatsmyip.org/regular-expression-tester/
[02:51:19] <seutje> isn't the caret to match start of a line?
[02:52:26] <joesavage> I think my problem may be to do with the timing of the animationend event, or maybe just because the logic of my jQuery is flawed, but I can't seem to find the damn problem when looking through...
[03:00:23] <PamPam> Hi, people! Somebody help me? )
[03:00:54] <j_wright> perhaps if you ask
[03:01:42] <sirionnn> So I have a test page that works fine (jquery+jquery-cookie, which defines a new function, $.cookie), but then if I load the *other* scripts that typically run on my site, then I start getting errors of $.cookie is undefined. Can other scripts erase previously defined functions?
[03:02:51] <PamPam> How disable auto coding (URIencode) ajax request in jquery?
[03:04:27] <seutje> make it a string
[03:04:37] <PamPam> Need to send binary data ...
[03:04:49] <PamPam> How?
[03:06:12] <PamPam> U mean $.post(url,data,callback,'string') ???
[03:06:24] <seutje> nah, I meant the data as a string
[03:06:45] <seutje> but u can prevent it from processing the data by specifying processData: false
[03:06:53] <PamPam> mmm, thx, i try
[03:07:05] <seutje> also, I have no clue about the shorthand methods, never use them myself
[03:10:02] <seutje> might have to make sure ur data object is either and ArrayBuffer, File or Blob object
[03:18:03] <joesavage> Since my home-built solutions really aren't working that well (http://jsfiddle.net/2MfXx/4/) is there any jQuery plugin or something that can help me have some basic content that can animate in and fade out upon a button click? (And that doesn't effect the page flow when faded out - like my example JSFiddle is trying so hard to do)
[03:19:50] <PamPam> seutje: thx, it works! (processData: false)
[03:23:51] <PamPam> seutje: oh, i mistake, it's not working!
[03:25:08] <PamPam> seutje: oh, i was mistake, it's not working!
[03:35:25] <joesavage> Really can't get jQuery and CSS animations to work together nicely -- should I just fall back to jQuery animations or does anyone have any advice for resolving the horrible-ness? http://jsfiddle.net/2MfXx/4/
[03:36:35] <sadtaco> ?eval
[03:43:07] <seutje> ?g jquery transit @ joesavage
[03:43:08] <b-ot> joesavage: Sorry, no results for ‟jquery transit @ joesavage”.
[03:43:17] <seutje> what the
[03:43:21] <seutje> http://ricostacruz.com/jquery.transit/
[03:43:52] <seutje> also, why do u cache that ID selector and then go on repeating it all over the place?
[03:44:18] <sadtaco> "not this (if foo){ ... } not this (if bar){ ...} not this".match(/\(if(.*)\}/gi) why does this return ["(if foo){ ... } not this (if bar){ ...}"] and not ["(if foo){ ... }", "(if bar){ ...}"]?
[03:45:53] <joesavage> seutje: Good point, I'll start using that variable instead. And I'll have a go with Transit now -- thanks for the suggestion
[03:46:18] <sadtaco> eh nevermind
[03:50:12] <joesavage> seutje: Also, can you see any flaws in my jQuery logic there? Sometimes (try continually switching between panels and you'll probably see it) the wrong panel seems to get selected and I'm not totally sure why...
[03:51:45] <seutje> joesavage: you set the classes after the animation, so during the animation, it's not considered in that state yet
[03:51:59] <seutje> click twice on something and it'll bork
[03:52:26] <joesavage> setuje: Yeah, I do that for a reason though -- if I set the classes before the animation the "display: none;" or whatever of the classes would override the animation
[03:53:08] <seutje> I'd have the class trigger the animation
[03:54:08] <joesavage> setuje: But then how would you apply a "display:none;" or something equal to take hidden elements out of the page flow?
[03:54:49] <seutje> why display none? height 0 should suffice, no?
[03:55:07] <seutje> although I'm not sure how the support for animation to height auto is
[03:56:22] <joesavage> seutje: height 0 is just a pain to work with -- although if it works in this case, it would probably solve a _lot_ of problems
[03:58:25] <joesavage> Height 0 would override any animation anyway -- if the height was instantly set to 0, the fade in/out wouldn't work
[03:58:32] <NoOova> hello all!
[03:59:23] <NoOova> if i use for (var idx in $elems)... where $elems is JQuery with elements. Will ids only numbers?
[03:59:50] <NoOova> or jquery internal properties will be affected too
[04:01:57] <seutje> joesavage: oh, u wanna fade?
[04:02:48] <joesavage> seutje: I want functionality as shown here: http://jsfiddle.net/2MfXx/5/ [So you can change the active pane, but also by clicking the same pane twice, close the whole section]
[04:18:30] <seutje> joesavage: those transition events don't seem to be firing for me http://jsfiddle.net/bZEpA/
[04:22:23] <joesavage> seutje: That example's working fine for me

[05:03:28] <seutje> joesavage: tha animating class isn't being removed for me
[05:04:20] <joesavage> seutje: Yeah, it doesn't get removed in my script. I think I'm going to dump the fade out effect though, it's just too difficult, so don't worry
[05:04:40] <joesavage> seutje: Now I just need to worry about how I'm going to stop the content below the boxes jumping up and down when the boxes transition in and out... Hmm...
[05:06:21] <seutje> joesavage: u'll prolly need a wrapper and might need to set a fixed height on it equal to the tallest tab or something?
[05:07:18] <joesavage> seutje: Yeah, the problem is though that the final system will use dynamic content...
[05:08:45] <seutje> yeah, I meant set the height with js
[05:16:09] <Mento> hey guys, im trying to add some basic paging to my table, but not sure how to paginate more table columns - http://jsfiddle.net/xUTnr/1/
[05:21:02] <daslicht> hi,
[05:21:14] <daslicht> i found this example herer to create a highlight effect :
[05:21:15] <daslicht> http://jsfiddle.net/daslicht/x2jrU/222/
[05:21:44] <daslicht> now i like to highlight a button , I do not fully understand how this example works , yet
[05:21:54] <daslicht> anyoone like to help me please ?
[05:25:09] <daslicht> essentially I am looking for a alternative for the jqueryui highlight effect
[05:25:29] <daslicht> since it seams not to work together with jquerytools
[05:39:54] <spobat> why does this print "[]" ? http://tinker.io/87536
[05:44:20] <seutje> spobat: use an object
[05:44:30] <seutje> http://tinker.io/87536/1
[05:44:49] <seutje> arrays are for keyed indexes
[05:45:33] <spobat> seutje, what do you mean by that?
[05:45:44] <spobat> an_array['c++'][5] should also work, right?
[05:46:03] <seutje> I'd call that improper use of an array
[05:46:12] <daslicht> clients.push() is working
[05:46:25] <daslicht> clients['somekey'].push( not
[05:46:29] <spobat> seutje, okay
[05:47:34] <sadtaco> What's the easiest or best way to get the height of a scrollable div's contents?
[05:47:34] <sadtaco> I would think children().height() but nope.
[05:49:03] <seutje> spobat: some reading on the topic http://www.phabricator.com/docs/phabricator/article/Javascript_Object_and_Array.html#objects-are-maps-arrays
[05:49:03] <aMoniker> sadtaco: that would likely get the height for the first child
[05:49:54] <aMoniker> sadtaco: you could clone the children(), put them in a div with similar formatting as the parent (but without overflow scrolling), hide the div offscreen, and measure the height
[05:49:59] <seutje> var height = 0; $('.something').children().each(function(){ height += $(this).outerHeight(); }); ?
[05:50:37] <seutje> that might screw up collapsing margins though
[05:50:41] <aMoniker> sadtaco: or just try .scrollHeight on the DOM element
[05:50:45] <Bennit> Hi
[05:51:00] <Bennit> I'm trying to use the heightStyle option on accordion and on tabs
[05:51:06] <Bennit> but neither seems to work
[05:51:15] <seutje> or u could just set the height to auto and overflow to visible and measure the height on the parent
[05:51:19] <aMoniker> sadtaco: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/element.scrollHeight
[05:51:23] <seutje> then remore the css
[05:53:25] <seutje> aMoniker: what good is that? that just gives u how far down it's currently scrolled o.O
[05:54:09] <seutje> aMoniker: no wait sorry, I'm tripping, it seems
[05:55:27] <Mento> hey guys, im trying to add some basic paging to my table, but not sure how to paginate more table columns - http://jsfiddle.net/xUTnr/1/
[05:55:34] <stygyan> hello guys
[05:55:52] <spobat> seutje, yep, thank you
[05:56:06] <spobat> was a good article
[05:56:21] <stygyan> how would you select "everything with the X class but the one that follows this item"?
[05:56:53] <seutje> ?next @ stygyan
[05:57:05] <stygyan> i know the $(this).next(), but i don't know the other part :)
[05:57:12] <spobat> seutje, what?
[05:57:22] <seutje> WAT
[05:57:27] <spobat> ?next ?
[05:57:36] <seutje> no bot :(
[05:57:44] <seutje> `jqapi next
[05:57:46] <spobat> !next d
[05:57:55] <seutje> damnit b-ot!
[05:58:17] <seutje> stygyan: what do u mean by "the other part" ?
[05:58:28] <stygyan> i think i didn't explain myself
[05:58:30] <Bennit> ok apparently you can't depend on heightStyle if the element you're making into an accordion or into a tabs is hidden
[05:58:45] <stygyan> i want to select everything with the class X except for the one right next to it.
[05:58:53] <seutje> oh
[05:58:58] <seutje> right next to what?
[05:59:06] <Bennit> if I show them, then make them into tabs/accordion, it does something more but still not fill up to the max size
[05:59:18] <stygyan> wait, jsfiddle
[05:59:40] <seutje> so u don't want to select things with class x that follow things with class x, but u do want the ones that would be followed?
[05:59:43] <stygyan> http://jsfiddle.net/2NZUZ/
[06:00:16] <stygyan> it's a small script. it allows me to expand a title into title and paragraph
[06:00:29] <stygyan> and at the same time hide the other opened paragraphs
[06:00:56] <stygyan> i would want to select all the paragraphs but the one next to the title i clicked on
[06:00:58] <seutje> this hurts my brain, when clicking on it, you show it?
[06:01:07] <seutje> then how did u click on it if it wasn't shown? o.O
[06:01:13] <stygyan> when you click on the title, the paragraph next to it appears.
[06:01:29] <stygyan> and the class "show" basically changes color and an arrow icon
[06:01:40] <seutje> oh, unfortunate name
[06:01:54] <stygyan> yes, should've been showing
[06:01:59] <seutje> so... what's the problem?
[06:02:30] <stygyan> i want to add another instruction that would deal with the rest of the .hide selectors
[06:02:57] <stygyan> so in line 7 instead of hiding everything with the class .hide
[06:03:08] <stygyan> i hide everything BUT the one that follows the title i clicked on
[06:06:58] <stygyan> oh
[06:06:59] <stygyan> done
[06:07:33] <stygyan> seutje: http://jsfiddle.net/2NZUZ/1/
[06:12:56] <seutje> stygyan: like this? http://jsfiddle.net/2NZUZ/2/
[06:13:18] <stygyan> oh
[06:13:18] <stygyan> yes
[06:13:22] <stygyan> that's quite more elegant
[06:13:30] <seutje> line 7 and 9 are kinda silly together though
[06:14:03] <stygyan> it's necessary because of a change in color.
[06:14:26] <stygyan> i noticed that if you click on other title, the paragraphs hide themselves, but the title keeps on being red.

[07:19:54] <brian____> can someone _please_ help me with bootstrap affix. I'm using it in a responsive layout so i need the offset to change depending on the breakpoint. I've got the data attribute updating but bootstrap doesn't seem to recognize the new value. so then i tried to reinitialize with $('.nav').affix(); i don't get any errors but it still uses the old value as the offset. I've been stuck for over a day now...

[07:20:30] <rbennacer> seutje, i am getting this error on chrome but not on FF, Uncaught ReferenceError: MutationObserver is not defined
[07:21:24] <seutje> rbennacer: like the table says, versions 18-27 use a prefixed version
[07:21:57] <seutje> actually, my version 26 has it unprefixed
[07:22:22] <rbennacer> what does prefixed version means?
[07:22:33] <seutje> no wait, version 26 has both
[07:22:44] <seutje> it means u have to put WebKit in front of it
[07:22:50] <rbennacer> mmmm
[07:22:51] <seutje> like window.WebKitMutationObserver
[07:22:53] <rbennacer> ok ok
[07:22:59] <Cristen> my .php returns {"valid":"true"} but in the success: function(data), data.valid returns indefined. What's wrong ?
[07:23:23] <seutje> Cristen: is the mime type set correctly?
[07:23:40] <rbennacer> seutje, thank you for your help
[07:24:34] <Cristen> seutje where can I find this ? I used datatype: "json" and firebugs adds a JSON tab when I click on the request
[07:24:43] <Cristen> + the headers shows X-Requested-With	XMLHttpRequest
[07:24:51] <seutje> Cristen: I meant response header
[07:25:45] <Cristen> in the JSON tab firebug displays : key : valid      "true"
[07:27:32] <MadLems> Does jQuery have a native "better" prompt function? (basically just something that looks nicer?)
[07:28:30] <RandalSchwartz> jquery-ui has a nice dialog box
[07:28:37] <RandalSchwartz> I use that instead of prompt()
[07:28:45] <BinaryKitten> MadLems no, not by default. You can create one using jquery-ui... but that's not "prompt"
[07:29:48] <MadLems> so, start here probably? http://jqueryui.com/dialog/
[07:30:29] <seutje> jQuery was designed to make traversal, animations and ajax easier
[07:30:44] <seutje> it contains no UI elements at all, that's what jQuery UI is for
[07:30:55] <Cristen> seutje, mime type is html, must be that
[07:30:58] <MadLems> seutje: gotcha. thanks :)
[07:31:59] <Selena> hello everyone
[07:32:10] <Selena> How can i reproduce the same thing like there? with the photos
[07:32:11] <Selena> http://bucharest.craigslist.org/ptd/3630425856.html
[07:32:19] <Selena> As you can see there is a big photo in middle, and 3 in left smaller
[07:32:24] <Selena> How could i reproduce that? how is it called?
[07:33:15] <Cristen> Selena a slideshow ?
[07:33:54] <amaroks> Selena: http://www.menucool.com/slider/jquery-slideshow
[07:34:20] <BillCriswell> Selena: You don't have to go crazy with a slideshow plugin, some basic jquery will work here.
[07:35:18] <Cristen> seutje it was the mime type that was incorrect thanks for helping me out :)
[07:36:04] <seutje> Selena: just copy their shit and reproduce the html :D http://www.craigslist.org/js/postings.js?v=9c55707e0bef2ff648841d09ff0ed11a
[07:36:20] <Cristen> BillCriswell depends if the person is jQuery friendly or not, if not only using a plugin and a function that looks like .carousel() is sometimes easier
[07:37:11] <BillCriswell> Selena: $('.gallery a').on('click', function(e){ e.preventDefault(); $('.main-photo').attr( 'src', $(this).attr('href')) }).eq(0).trigger('click');
[07:40:59] <BillCriswell> Selena: Here's some code for it. http://jsbin.com/avigug/1/edit
[07:43:59] <Selena> w8 i soon read BillCriswell what you said
[07:44:00] <Selena> thank you
[07:44:12] <BillCriswell> Welcome.
[07:54:03] <Selena> BillCriswell finally i checked it, yeah
[07:54:09] <Selena> That's it:) you solved my issue
[07:54:28] <Selena> Thank you very much for it.
[07:56:23] <godwinh> hi everyone! is it possible to apply an svg pattern to another svg image?
[07:59:42] <BillCriswell> Welcome Selena.

[08:03:31] <Selena> BillCriswell how do you call this type of displaying images?
[08:03:34] <Croves> Can I do this? $('#seList option').on('dblclick', function() { alert('Hello'); }); My '#seList ' is a select list with a few options inside
[08:03:46] <Selena> Does it have a name? maybe i can google to find some more examples with different designs
[08:03:47] <Croves> I wanna display the hello alert when double click one option
[08:06:10] <BillCriswell> Selena: Not sure what it would be called. I guess just a gallery.
[08:06:13] <edenc> when I refresh a page that has a selected radio button on it, firefox preserves the radio button checked state but .prop("checked") is false for all the radio inputs. I want to figure out the cached value from firefox so I can update the rest of the page accordingly. any ideas?
[08:06:37] <edenc> well, not radio button, radio *input*
[08:10:04] <zoned> i'm working on an image uploader… it is drag n drop. i would like for the browser to just display the image by using the local file path on the user's desktop, until they hit the "Save" button, and then the images actually get uploaded. How would one go about this?
[08:11:58] <bakers> Can I select all tags that have data-foo="Bar"
[08:12:00] <Croves> I'm filling my select list with jQuery and Ajax. The user click a button and with ajax I'll search for some itens in my database... and after all, I use .append() to get the results and insert into my list
[08:12:43] <Croves> But after that, I can't do nothing with the options... I need to double-ckick a option and display a message, but when I do $('#seList option').on('dblclick', function() { alert('Hello'); }); nothing happens
[08:12:51] <Croves> ANd Firebug doesn't show me nothing
[08:17:14] <seutje> Mento: http://jsfiddle.net/xUTnr/2/
[08:17:28] <seutje> could prolly make it less repetitive and use a single handler for both buttons, but I got lazy
[08:19:17] <daslicht> hi
[08:19:19] <daslicht> http://tinker.io/bd0d4
[08:19:38] <daslicht> not jquery at all but perhaps someone knows why this is not working
[08:19:59] <daslicht> even tho its described in the moz docs
[08:20:12] <daslicht> only working in chome , safari , NOT in FF
[08:20:52] <seutje> Mento: there, single handler http://jsfiddle.net/xUTnr/3/
[08:25:53] <initself> i'm using jQuery UI Tabs and I want to actually rewrite the URL when a tab is clicked to include the #hashtag without refreshing the page.  Is that possible?
[08:26:05] <hashpuppy> if I have $(window).keypress(...)... how do i unbind htat?
[08:27:08] <hashpuppy> namespace it?
[08:34:08] <omani_> I have a flotchart problem. everything works. but I need each date on xaxis to be shown once
[08:34:11] <omani_> http://paste.scsys.co.uk/237869?ln=on&tidy=on&hl=on&submit=Format+it!
[08:34:16] <omani_> above is the code
[08:35:34] <omani_> that means, the xaxis timeformat is correct, but it shouldn't be progressive
[08:36:39] <omani_> the chart now has: x:23/3 y:3, x: 24/3 y:4, x: 25/3 y: 4
[08:37:10] <omani_> but is still going on
[09:00:04] <didiergm> hey guys, on some label/input box, I am trying to get a larger space for the label but I don't seem to get a style="width:40%" on the label to be used. Do you know of an other way ?
[09:05:55] <Luke23ae> question regarding jquery UI: I have draggables and dropables. I'm trying to get the position of a draggable relative to a droppable when I move it over the droppable. Is there a built in functionality for this, or do I have to write it myself?
[09:19:26] <naeluh> good morning ?
[09:22:48] <al-p> g00d morning
[09:23:20] <naeluh> al-p: same to you !
[09:23:55] <JAAulde> The documentation for UI's _super() is confusing. As I understand it, it will call the method from the parent which I have overridden, in scope of my extended instance, and any defined params in my func definition will be passed along.  like .call(this, p1, p2)
[09:23:59] <al-p> :)
[09:24:01] <JAAulde> that does not seem to be happening, though
[09:24:16] <JAAulde> _super() is not sending my params along
[09:24:22] <al-p> someone kind enough to help me out
[09:25:27] <JAAulde> I think it is actually a docs issue--or my understanding thereof.
[09:25:49] <JAAulde> The docs for _super() say "This method does not accept any arguments."
[09:26:12] <JAAulde> But to get it to pass certain things into the parent as params, you have to pass them to super
[09:26:38] <JAAulde> those docs are really confusing to me, but I have it worked out now so whatevs I guess
[09:55:34] <rollitup_> hey guys jquery novice
[09:55:53] <shoky> JAAulde: you're right, the docs are wrong
[09:56:14] <rollitup_> i am trying to use this quote rotator plugin and i keep getting "TypeError: d is undefined"
[09:56:35] <spobat> why does this result in an error(Object ! has no method 'indexof' )? http://jsfiddle.net/DaqQZ/http://jsfiddle.net/DaqQZ/
[09:56:36] <rollitup_> this is how i am trying to instantiate the plugin http://pastie.org/7163660
[09:57:02] <shoky> JAAulde: hmm actually maybe just confusing ;p in any case i agree ;p
[09:59:42] <Salman> hi, i have a div with an element <a onclick=somefunction()>, i want to delete the div inside that function, how can i do that?
[10:00:17] <shoky> spobat:  because there's no .indexof method
[10:00:36] <spobat> I see it's indexOf
[10:00:42] <spobat> ty :}
[10:01:43] <pachet> Salman: don't assign handlers in attributes
[10:01:50] <pachet> this is #jquery, for crying out loud
[10:01:55] <pachet> land of convenience
[10:02:10] <Salman> i'm passing something in that function
[10:02:37] <pachet> i dont know what that has to do with what i just said
[10:02:40] <spobat> btw, I wanted a to make a "calculator" with that eval thing
[10:02:43] <pachet> inline events are an antipattern
[10:02:52] <ezakimak> Salman, it would look like this.parentNode.parentNode.removeChild(this.parentNode)
[10:02:56] <pachet> actually that's not the right word
[10:02:58] <pachet> they're just bad
[10:04:05] <pachet> ?.on() @ Salman
[10:04:06] <bot-t> Salman, .on() | jQuery API Documentation - Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[10:04:48] <Salman> i know, but how i would i pass that value then? i'm dynamically creating that div from php
[10:05:13] <ezakimak> Salman, php is run on the server. js is executed on the client
[10:05:28] <edoop> hi
[10:05:29] <Salman> yes
[10:06:16] <Salman> <a onclick=somefunction(<?php echo($someelement)?>)</a> how would i pass that element through event handler?
[10:06:20] <shoky> rollitup_:  i think you need to include Modernizr to use that plugin
[10:08:55] <ezakimak> Salman, are you thinking that somefunction will *return* an event handler function?
[10:09:58] <Salman> no, if im supposed to make an event handler function of onclick instead of inline onclick function, how would i pass this value?
[10:10:37] <ezakimak> well, for starters, php is not js--php has no access to js variables other than by name or if you know it's string identifier for it's id attribute
[10:11:12] <ezakimak> first write it in js. then, write php to generate that same js
[10:11:28] <rollitup_> shoky: i have included the modernizr js too
[10:11:32] <Salman> somefunction() is a js function
[10:11:56] <ezakimak> of course
[10:12:17] <momomomomo> Afternoon all
[10:12:59] <ezakimak> is there a relationship between html5shiv and modernizr?
[10:13:18] <Tak0r> heyho guys
[10:13:37] <Salman> you're not getting me at all, you said make an event handler for onclick instead of inline onclick, im asking if i do that, how would i pass the value im passing through inline onclick if i make an event handler
[10:14:01] <ezakimak> it's the same thing either way
[10:14:01] <Tak0r> anyone know's why ajax filtering works locally but not when i upload it to the webserver?
[10:14:39] <pachet> Salman: <div id="foo" data-param="<?php echo $whatever; ?>">foo</div>
[10:14:59] <pachet> $('#foo').on('click.foo', function ( event ) { console.log($(this).data('param')); })
[10:15:40] <Salman> ok, thanks!
[10:15:40] <ezakimak> pachet, why does on need click.foo and not just click? seems redundant
[10:15:54] <pachet> ezakimak: what if you wanted to remove just that single click handler
[10:16:02] <pachet> and no other click handlers that happened to be bound to that element
[10:16:24] <ezakimak> is the '.foo' arbitrary there?
[10:16:34] <ezakimak> or does it match the id attr?
[10:16:36] <JAAulde> shoky: glad I'm not the only one!
[10:16:41] <pachet> no, its completely arbitrary
[10:16:48] <pachet> you can change it to whatever would work best in that case
[10:16:59] <ezakimak> ah. ok. was just an ambiguous example then :)
[10:17:38] <ezakimak> can you control the order of firing of click handlers when there are multiple?
[10:18:09] <ezakimak> is it by order of attachment? order of name? (the .foo part?)
[10:23:26] <pachet> order of attachment, just like in the actual DOM
[10:38:25] <Kolorbon> Hello ;) I have a div. When I click on it, an ajax-call happens, and content appears. I dont want to click, so i made a $.getJSON to show the content directly. Now the problem is, the content is shown, but, when I click on the div, the content is not shown in it. Is that normal?
[10:39:38] <Kolorbon> Is the problem maybe a for-loop, because I do the $.getJSON-call up to 17 times in it.
[10:40:16] <eddiemonge> 17 requests? why?
[10:40:40] <Kolorbon> Because there are up to 17 elements with that content.
[10:40:51] <mitzev_> can i use multiple divs in .hide()?
[10:40:51] <eddiemonge> is the content different?
[10:41:07] <eddiemonge> mitzev_: you mean hide multiple divs in one hide call?
[10:41:08] <Kolorbon> eddiemonge, it can be.
[10:41:42] <mitzev_> yes
[10:42:23] <mitzev_> $(".divClass").hide()
[10:42:30] <mitzev_> $(".divClass .div2 .div3").hide()
[10:42:36] <mitzev_> will that work?
[10:43:52] <pachet> mitzev_: yes
[10:45:58] <Kolorbon> mitzev_, Uhm, the 2nd: You wrote it like, that div3 is an under-element of div2, and div2 an under-element of divClass, so only div3 is hidden.
[10:47:23] <mitzev_> ?
[10:47:33] <mitzev_> i want to hide multiple elements with one call to .hide
[10:47:41] <mitzev_> how do i do that?
[10:47:44] <godwinh> anyone have used fabric.js for svg?
[10:47:45] <mitzev_> with spaces or comas?
[10:48:13] <Kolorbon> Commatas, but idk if that works, just try it.
[10:49:00] <ezakimak> should i load modernizr first or last?
[10:49:08] <ezakimak> or does it matter at all?
[10:49:43] <eddiemonge> mitzev_: commas
[10:49:53] <eddiemonge> $(".divClass, .div2, .div3").hide()
[10:50:00] <mitzev_> ok thankyou
[10:50:13] <eddiemonge> ezakimak: first or last what? first js script? first in the head or last in body?
[10:50:15] <mitzev_> also
[10:50:23] <ezakimak> where in head?
[10:50:39] <ezakimak> w/re to other js and/or css files
[10:50:45] <eddiemonge> ezakimak: did you read the documentation at all? http://modernizr.com/docs/#installing
[10:50:57] <ezakimak> i did. obviously i should reread
[10:51:07] <mitzev_> should i use <a href="#" onclick"event.preventDefault(); myFunc();" id="link1"> .. or some like $('link1').click(...) ?
[10:51:23] <mitzev_> any difference?
[10:51:27] <ezakimak> it just says after css--nothing about other js
[10:51:29] <eddiemonge> mitzev_: you should never really be writing inline js
[10:51:42] <mitzev_> so favor in the second ?
[10:51:52] <Kolorbon> eddiemonge, so can you help me with my $.getJSON problem, that I wrote above?
[10:51:55] <eddiemonge> ezakimak: do you normally put your js before your css?
[10:52:03] <ezakimak> no
[10:52:16] <mitzev_> are u saying its bad idea to use onclick onhover etc?
[10:52:16] <eddiemonge> Kolorbon: you havent put any code to see yet?
[10:52:22] <mitzev_> in the html tags?
[10:52:24] <mitzev_> :/
[10:52:30] <eddiemonge> mitzev_: im saying its bad to put js inline.
[10:52:33] <eddiemonge> so yes
[10:53:13] <eddiemonge> ezakimak: as a general rule, your js should be at the end of the body. there are exceptions though, but generally speaking
[10:53:15] <mitzev_> any references?
[10:53:22] <ezakimak> i never put js in the body
[10:53:29] <eddiemonge> ezakimak: why not?
[10:53:31] <ezakimak> i always load them in the head
[10:54:12] <ezakimak> i see no reason to mix code with content
[10:54:30] <Kolorbon> eddiemonge, http://jsfiddle.net/Kolorbon/t6mqq/
[10:55:04] <eddiemonge> ezakimak: other than performance?
[10:55:17] <ezakimak> why would that make a difference?
[10:55:29] <eddiemonge> and its not mixing code with content. if you think that then no matter where you put it, its mixing code with content
[10:55:42] <eddiemonge> ezakimak: do you know what blocking vs nonblocking is?
[10:55:49] <ezakimak> yes, i do
[10:56:03] <dcherman> ezakimak: scripts block the rest of the page while they download - putting them at the end allows content to be displayed quicker, even if functionality isn't there yet
[10:56:13] <utroda> Has anyone ever had the issue where, hover events fire on click, but not on hover?
[10:56:28] <dcherman> browsers can't make the assumption that content can be loaded in parallell because a script could do something like document.write
[10:57:04] <ezakimak> it won't matter for my application. there is no content in my <body>--it's a SPA entirely js driven
[10:57:06] <eddiemonge> utroda: in ios yes but not other places
[10:57:30] <eddiemonge> ezakimak: then that is an exception. a very, very rare exception
[10:57:33] <dcherman> ezakimak: so there's no code to mix with content anyway :)  but you're correct - in that specific case, it doesn't matter.
[10:57:41] <eddiemonge> and a bad one if you care about accessibility at all
[10:57:58] <ezakimak> i mean ,there is a menu, but it would be bad to render a menu w/no code yet to react to it--that would be worse imo
[10:59:06] <utroda> eddiemonge: its not ios, its mac/chrome - http://paste.laravel.com/m1o
[10:59:33] <eddiemonge> ezakimak: is all your code document.write?
[10:59:47] <ezakimak> i have no document.write()s
[11:00:24] <eddiemonge> ezakimak: then how does your code affect your menus? event bindings? delegation?
[11:00:35] <ezakimak> client side routing
[11:01:12] <didiergm> on jquerymobile is it possible to use grid inside a grid ?
[11:02:49] <ezakimak> any opinions on boilerplate? is jquery-ui-boilerplate advantageous to use?
[11:03:35] <eddiemonge> ezakimak: i meant are you doing your code in a document ready block?
[11:03:45] <ezakimak> yes
[11:03:59] <ezakimak> that's the entry point
[11:04:08] <ezakimak> except for initializing some globals
[11:05:05] <eddiemonge> utroda: http://jsfiddle.net/xZMM5/ looks fine
[11:05:35] <eddiemonge> ezakimak: then it doesnt matter if the code is after the menu or not because it won't fire anyway until the menu is in the DOM
[11:06:05] <Kolorbon> eddiemonge, http://jsfiddle.net/Kolorbon/t6mqq/
[11:06:20] <eddiemonge> ezakimak: linke to jquery-ui-boilerplate you are talking about?
[11:07:02] <ezakimak> sorry. meant bootstrap
[11:08:00] <grid_> hey
[11:08:22] <grid_> i'm looking for a html file (or any script that can open my browser) to function like a tabbrowser so i can preset a couple of webpages, they need to be preloaded, can somebody suggest me something? it is for on my work so i don't have to open each webpage over and over again
[11:08:36] <grid_> if i use frames they will not preload i think so
[11:09:10] <ezakimak> just use ff, create a new profile, open the tabs you want, and it will be saved in your session when you exit. just 'restore session' when you open it
[11:10:08] <grid_> i'm looking for a file to open in internet explorer, i can't install any other browsers/addons
[11:10:20] <grid_> it's at work
[11:10:34] <ezakimak> probably a question for #windows or #ie
[11:10:42] <utroda> eddiemonge: Shit.... I had emulate touch events on. Thanks for the help
[11:10:44] <eddiemonge> Kolorbon: is that your api?
[11:11:24] <eddiemonge> grid_: you arent allowed to use FF or chrome?
[11:11:41] <grid_> indeed
[11:11:41] <Kolorbon> eddiemonge, yes.
[11:11:44] <eddiemonge> grid_: in chrome you can open the tabs and save them all as a single bookmark
[11:11:51] <eddiemonge> grid_: are you a developer?
[11:12:14] <eddiemonge> Kolorbon: i would change the api to accept a list of islands and cities so you can make a single request and then parse that out
[11:12:20] <grid_> eddiemonge: and the pages are only tested for internet explorer, no, but i can write html/jquery pages
[11:12:26] <ragas> jQuery("body").toggle(); // ok  $("body").toggle(); // fails; id swear i used this before.
[11:13:10] <eddiemonge> grid_: only tested for IE? is this 2001 again? im sad for you if thats the case
[11:13:57] <eddiemonge> ragas: jQuery(document.body).toggle()
[11:14:00] <grid_> well, it is a cable company i'm working for, besides that, i don't care about that, i just need a working solution, so if someone has a example where i see pages that are fetched from a server where i could switch from :)
[11:14:32] <ragas> eddiemonge: the point is, why doesnt the $ work?
[11:14:35] <phetrak> hello
[11:15:03] <phetrak> can anyone help me with jquery form plugin?
[11:15:26] <eddiemonge> grid_: window.open
[11:15:40] <phetrak> can anyone help me with jquery form plugin?
[11:15:47] <eddiemonge> ragas: because you are using noconflict? because another library is taking it over? lots of reasons
[11:15:57] <Kolorbon> eddiemonge, that's impossible, because then I would need again more requests to get the id's of the islands and cities, because at once I just can see 1 island.
[11:16:05] <grid_> eddiemonge: can you think of a script that is made for my ideas?
[11:16:49] <mitzev_> how come my $(".div1).click(..) is not workign
[11:16:52] <eddiemonge> Kolorbon: nothings impossible. you can send a list of islands and cities and receive back a list of ids with those
[11:17:00] <mitzev_> im clicking on an element with a class of class="div1"
[11:17:06] <mitzev_> but not detecting the click :/
[11:17:22] <theDude_> hi guys
[11:17:24] <eddiemonge> grid_: yeah. window.open('url1'); window.open('url2'). a spammer-like code
[11:17:54] <eddiemonge> mitzev_: do you get a console error?
[11:18:09] <ezakimak> grid_, ^^^^ set your browser to "open new windows in tabs" and make your window.open target _blank
[11:18:10] <theDude_> can you include google analytics inside an if statment like so  if ($('body').hasClass('real-estate')) { } ?
[11:18:11] <phetrak> I have question why this code doesn't work? $("#titleform").ajaxForm({ target: '#preview' }).submit();
[11:18:22] <Kolorbon> eddiemonge, not impossible, but it also should be userfriendly and it should not load too long. I would have to make a $.getJSON call to every island, and there are more than 400 pieces.
[11:18:35] <mitzev_> i used addClass to add the class
[11:18:47] <mitzev_> then i detect if the element with the added class has been clickd..
[11:18:50] <mitzev_> but not working
[11:18:53] <eddiemonge> theDude_: yes
[11:18:54] <mitzev_> if i hardcode the class, it works
[11:18:58] <mitzev_> (in the html)
[11:19:09] <mitzev_> but if i dynamically addClass, it doesnt pick up
[11:19:10] <phetrak> I have question why this code doesn't work? $("#titleform").ajaxForm({ target: '#preview' }).submit();
[11:19:15] <theDude_> thanks eddiemonge
[11:19:17] <eddiemonge> phetrak: work for what?
[11:19:53] <eddiemonge> Kolorbon: isnt that what you are doing now?
[11:20:00] <grid_> eddiemonge: i need something preconfigurated, i don't have days of time for development
[11:20:08] <eddiemonge> mitzev_: did you call the event handler before adding the class?
[11:20:20] <phetrak> eddiemonge come to priv
[11:20:32] <eddiemonge> mitzev_: you most likely need to delegate the handler
[11:20:32] <Kolorbon> eddiemonge, no. Now i just do a call to only one island. Because at once i only see one.
[11:20:53] <eddiemonge> grid_: days of dev time? i gave you a solution that was seconds
[11:21:27] <phetrak> eddie~ can we go to priv?
[11:22:01] <eddiemonge> phetrak: why? cant you just say it here in case other people can help too
[11:22:12] <grid_> eddiemonge: can you jsfiddle it? :)
[11:22:21] <eddiemonge> Kolorbon: im consufed tehn
[11:22:37] <eddiemonge> grid_: no. window.open('url'); window.open('url2')
[11:22:39] <phetrak> Can anyone look at this problem https://forum.jquery.com/topic/problem-with-jquery-form-plugin-29-3-2013
[11:23:30] <grid_> eddiemonge: that would make new windows opened, i want to open all pages in the same window
[11:23:47] <eddiemonge> phetrak: you dont need the .html('') line since the next line does the same thing
[11:24:55] <eddiemonge> phetrak: also which form plugin? there are a trillion? and i dont think your form is getting targeted correctly. also, return false in the submit means the form wont be submitted ever
[11:24:55] <phetrak> ok, but this is not problem because I left only " $("#titleform"+i).ajaxForm({                         target: '#preview'         }).submit();  "
[11:25:03] <eddiemonge> grid_: huh?
[11:25:17] <eddiemonge> phetrak: what is i?
[11:25:19] <Kolorbon> eddiemonge, ok, from beginning: I have an island, and on it up to 17 cities. When I click on a city, an ajax-call is done and with that, content shown. But I want to show the content in a second way, by hovering over the city, with other css. The problem is: The hover-content and the click-content is not shown fully, just a part of it.
[11:25:58] <phetrak> i is int variable because I have forms in while loop
[11:26:02] <phetrak> I use this plugin http://www.malsup.com/jquery/form/
[11:26:41] <phetrak> but if I want to do this script in only one form also isn't work
[11:26:56] <grid_> eddiemonge: wouldnt open window.open a new browser window?
[11:27:46] <eddiemonge> Kolorbon: what do you mean not shown fully?
[11:28:04] <eddiemonge> phetrak: forms in a javascript loop?
[11:29:11] <phetrak> eddiemonge: in php loop and I start this function on <input type="button" onclick="test('.$i.')" name="save_title" value="Save" />
[11:29:43] <phetrak> eddiemonge: if I left only one form it was the same problem
[11:30:14] <eddiemonge> phetrak: how about you paste the outputted code into jsfiddle since i dont know what your php is spitting out
[11:30:29] <phetrak> ok wait moment
[11:30:35] <Kolorbon> eddiemonge, uhm, complicated to explain: In the content I need, there are some buttons. They can have the class "invisible", if the button should not be used. But the most time, they dont have this class. But now, with my method, every button has this class. So it's useless.
[11:33:17] <eddiemonge> Kolorbon: so thats a different problem then you originally asked about
[11:33:47] <Kolorbon> eddiemonge, in fact, that's the same problem, just deeper explained.
[11:35:28] <ezakimak> sounds like your method is broken. ;)
[11:36:58] <Kolorbon> Maybe, but maybe too because of the for-loop: http://jsfiddle.net/Kolorbon/t6mqq/ Seldom, but rarely seldom, the method works, and the full content is shown.
[11:38:16] <grid_> can someone give ma a jsfiddle example to switch between webpages? they must be run in the background, so no refesh until i hit a link :)
[11:38:29] <grid_> ma=me
[11:40:55] <ezakimak> define "switch between webpages"
[11:40:58] <phetrak> eddiemonge: http://jsfiddle.net/Cx4jz/1/ I have problem with run php in this editor. I pase code can you look at it
[11:41:05] <phetrak> paste*
[11:42:43] <eddiemonge> phetrak: i need to see the outputted php, not the actual php code
[11:43:56] <phetrak> ok
[11:46:29] <cardguy1000> If I have a class called datepicker that I have set globally to this:  $('.datepicker).datepicker({'autoclose: true'})  Then I want to extend the options via another class, so for example <input type='text' class='datepicker maxtoday'...>, of course I could just define maxtoday to declare the entire $('.datepicker).datepicker({'autoclose: true, setEndDate: '03/29/2013''}) but is there way extend the datepicker class so I can just add the
[11:46:29] <cardguy1000>  setEndDate: '03/29/2013' part when tacking on  the maxtoday class?
[11:47:34] <phetrak> eddiemonge: http://jsfiddle.net/Cx4jz/2/ look at this
[11:48:10] <eddiemonge> cardguy1000: is the class added before or after datepicker() is called?
[11:48:31] <cardguy1000> before
[11:49:00] <cardguy1000> that is done via html
[11:51:14] <grid_> eddiemonge: i need this to work: http://jsfiddle.net/VhUp2/
[11:52:28] <phetrak> ?
[11:54:21] <grid_> eddiemonge: i need something that brings that idea to live :)
[11:55:59] <eddiemonge> phetrak: what are you trying to do again?
[11:56:48] <phetrak> I want to execute script in action
[11:57:02] <phetrak> with post variables
[11:57:25] <phetrak> and load result to <div id="preview"></div>
[11:57:44] <naeluh> goood morning!
[11:58:30] <naeluh> :)
[11:58:39] <naeluh> ;)
[11:58:46] <eddiemonge> phetrak: you want to show a loading screen when a form is submitted, submit it via ajax and then show some content when the data is returned?
[12:01:49] <aberrant> hi all
[12:01:54] <aberrant> is anyone using datatables?
[12:02:17] <ezakimak> not yet. will in the future
[12:03:04] <aberrant> trying to figure out how to hide alengthmenu and the associated dropdown.
[12:03:29] <phetrak> I want to show info when scipt is submiting data to action script and if it's done I want to display result
[12:05:14] <ezakimak> you can use $.ajaxSetup({ beforeSend: fn, complete: fn2 })
[12:06:34] <ezakimak> fn could be function() { $('#placeholderdiv').dialog({modal:true, position: "center"}) } and fn2 could be function() { $('placeholderdiv').dialog('close'); }
[12:07:03] <phetrak> any solution eddiemonge?
[12:07:29] <eddiemonge> phetrak: listen to what ezakimak is saying
[12:07:40] <eddiemonge> you dont need a plugin for this
[12:08:00] <phetrak> but I have other script and it's similar and it works :(
[12:08:50] <ezakimak> so use it?
[12:09:46] <phetrak> ezakimak I use it to build this code but this code don't work
[12:09:48] <phetrak> :(
[12:09:58] <ezakimak> so your code broke it
[12:10:00] <ezakimak> ;)
[12:10:15] <ezakimak> divide and conquer
[12:10:22] <eddiemonge> why use a plugin when you dont need it?
[12:10:31] <ezakimak> comment out half and see which half breaks it
[12:10:36] <ezakimak> rinse, repeat
[12:11:30] <boytoy> Say, why does this jQuery Mobile fixed footer jump ever so slightly when you click on the area above it? http://jsfiddle.net/Mh8pf/
[12:11:31] <phetrak> eddiemonge do you have any tutorial for sending data in post without using Form plugin?
[12:11:46] <ezakimak> there's a *huge* difference between asking "what is breaking" vs "why does this break it"
[12:11:58] <eddiemonge> phetrak: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.post/
[12:12:03] <phetrak> ezakimak: this line is executing " $("#preview").html('<img src="loader.gif" alt="Ładowanie...."/>');"
[12:12:13] <phetrak> but all code below not :(
[12:13:22] <ezakimak> what is the node with id="preview"?
[12:13:51] <ezakimak> and if you comment out that line, does the rest work?
[12:14:11] <phetrak> it's a div container
[12:15:19] <phetrak> no rest doesn't work even when I comment line with ajaxForm
[12:15:31] <ezakimak> ok, so that line isn't the problem
[12:15:55] <ezakimak> any errors in your web console?
[12:16:17] <phetrak> no errors in console
[12:16:48] <ezakimak> well, then test line-by-line, and log everything and test as you go
[12:19:56] <cythrawll> so we have a really weird bug with the 26 update.
[12:20:11] <cythrawll> it seems that sometimes css fetched from the browser's cache doesn't apply to sites
[12:21:37] <milovan> hi, i m having a problem with scroll. It says TypeError: __table.offset(...) is null (porting jQuery code from 1.3 to 1.5+). Whats wrong with offset() or whats changed?
[12:22:05] <cythrawll> the way we had to fix it was to send headers and strip headers to prevent our pages coming back with 304 and added no-cache headers for css
[12:22:09] <cythrawll> it's pretty scare
[12:22:10] <cythrawll> y
[12:22:20] <cythrawll> chrome cacheing is busted
[12:22:41] <Eviltwin> milovan: Sounds like __table isn't a jQuery object
[12:22:44] <eddiemonge> cythrawll: huh? are you in the right channel?
[12:23:37] <cythrawll> i guess not.
[12:23:37] <milovan> Eviltwin: __table is $('#mh-monthly-report')
[12:23:39] <cythrawll> sorry about that
[12:23:53] <Eviltwin> milovan: Sounds like $ isn't jQuery then
[12:24:00] <Eviltwin> ?demo @ milovan
[12:24:01] <b-ot> milovan: Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[12:26:17] <omani_> could someone have a look at this please?
[12:26:19] <omani_> http://paste.scsys.co.uk/237969?ln=on&tidy=on&hl=on&submit=Format+it!
[12:26:22] <omani_> my second for loop doesn't count to 0
[12:26:54] <omani_> http://paste.scsys.co.uk/237969?ln=on&hl=on&submit=Format+it! fixed indentation
[12:27:43] <eddiemonge> omani_: i feel like your two loops should be one
[12:28:36] <omani_> eddiemonge: yes that's an option
[12:28:38] <omani_> I will make it
[12:28:40] <omani_> but
[12:28:45] <omani_> my output is: [["1363996800000",7],["1364083200000",7],["1364169600000",13],["1364515200000",17]]
[12:28:54] <omani_> but ["1364169600000",13] should be ["1364169600000",12]
[12:30:29] <Eviltwin> Why?
[12:31:25] <omani_> Eviltwin: because my second parameter has the same tick
[12:31:30] <omani_> with "1" in it
[12:31:44] <omani_> taht means the first param with the same tick should get its value decremented
[12:32:15] <milovan> Eviltwin: thanks, you gave me a good hint. It seems earlier i could pass null to offset and it wont complain but now it requires object or it will fail (means more strictier than in 1.3?)
[12:36:05] <shoky> boytoy:  http://jsfiddle.net/Mh8pf/1/
[12:38:23] <htmelvis> anyone have any good mobile redirect scripts
[12:40:00] <milovan> Eviltwin: many many thanks, solved it. :)
[12:43:17] <marks-c1> looking advice on whether to go down the jquery route or invest the time into javascript, would anyone be able to adivse me?
[12:43:35] <systemfault> marks-c1: You need both.
[12:44:14] <pachet> learn javascript
[12:44:25] <marks-c1> Im a front end dev and looking at what route to go with
[12:44:40] <marks-c1> Would you recommend jquery as a starting point?
[12:44:46] <systemfault> marks-c1: Learn JS, then normal DOM… then finally jQuery
[12:45:03] <pachet> jquery is an abstraction library
[12:45:08] <pachet> it helps to know what you're abstracting
[12:45:32] <systemfault> marks-c1: For JS, there's eloquent javascript, for DOM… http://domenlightenment.com/
[12:45:46] <systemfault> Don't know about a good jQuery tutorial
[12:46:07] <marks-c1> ok, thanks Im just wanting to invest the time wisely
[12:46:53] <marks-c1> see i bought two books
[12:47:16] <systemfault> If you don't care then do like most… learn jQuery and then you'll keep asking stupid questions because you'll never understand what exactly happens
[12:47:21] <marks-c1> Head first jQuery and  javascript by Example by Quigley
[12:47:29] <marks-c1> lol
[12:47:37] <systemfault> Sad… but true.
[12:47:41] <marks-c1> yea
[12:48:26] <systemfault> I had prior programming knowledge so I started with "Javascript: The good parts" but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone as a tutorial
[12:49:24] <marks-c1> ok man, would recommend a book for beginning? I have done code academies js course but Im struggling to be honest with the whole object, class
[12:50:03] <marks-c1> for example I would know how to create objects etc but I just find it intimidating
[12:50:05] <systemfault> eloquent javascript has nice reviews.. but I haven'tread it.
[12:50:19] <systemfault> var x = {};  You got your object :P
[12:51:02] <marks-c1> literal notation ;P

[12:59:55] <rideh> is there an event to watch for a class aded or removed?
[13:00:01] <FLeiXiuS`> Is there a .on event that can handle future objects like .live?
[13:00:22] <systemfault> FLeiXiuS`: Yeah, the second form of .on
[13:00:46] <systemfault> FLeiXiuS`: $(document).on(event, selector, handler)

[14:02:59] <lyrae> anyone here familiar with jquerytools?
[14:05:17] <ali1234-v6> http://jsfiddle.net/XtnGm/1/ <- why does this work in every browser except for IE9?
[14:06:39] <eddiemonge> what does ie9 say?
[14:06:49] <ali1234-v6> nothing at all
[14:06:55] <pachet> its likely caching the result
[14:06:56] <ali1234-v6> the callback function simply never gets run
[14:07:00] <ali1234-v6> there is no error output
[14:07:15] <systemfault> Or same-origin issues.
[14:07:19] <eddiemonge> ali1234-v6: what do you get if you visit http://gdata.youtube.com/feeds/api/videos/0-wPMwK5-zw?v=2&alt=jsonc directly?
[14:08:15] <ali1234-v6> eddiemonge: i get "do you want to open or save" and then it does not know what to open it with
[14:08:33] <vladikoff> ali1234-v6, https://www.google.com/search?q=ie9+getJSON
[14:08:35] <ali1234-v6> (in IE9, in any other browser i simply get the json plaintext)
[14:08:58] <eddiemonge> ali1234-v6: have you tried other ie9s? like on someone elses computer?
[14:09:19] <ali1234-v6> yes. i had to borrow a computer because people are complaining our website does not work in IE9
[14:09:24] <ali1234-v6> this is what i traced the issue to
[14:10:08] <eddiemonge> try with "To resolve this problem you must send your HTTP response with "noStore = true" and "Duration = 0" or equivalent."
[14:10:17] <systemfault> Like I said… it's probably same-origin policy issue.
[14:10:27] <ali1234-v6> http://jsfiddle.net/z5b2J/7/ this one works
[14:10:37] <ali1234-v6> the only difference is it's yahoo rather than youtube
[14:10:45] <systemfault> Of course.. it's using JSONP..
[14:10:48] <systemfault> shrug..
[14:12:10] <ali1234-v6> oh wait, actually it doesn't work
[14:13:13] <ali1234-v6> of course... JSONP
[14:14:25] <systemfault> Like i said.. if you specified you wanted jsonp.. your problem would have been solved by now...
[14:14:54] <ali1234-v6> ok. i want jsonp. i don't see how my problem is solved yet.
[14:14:57] <b-lew> can someone help me with this problem? I'm lost.
[14:15:27] <hugo_moss> is there some kind of invisible character that can cause mismatches in parenthesis in sublime text 2?
[14:15:28] <systemfault> ali1234-v6: Does that one works ? http://jsfiddle.net/XtnGm/4/
[14:15:46] <systemfault> ali1234-v6: I simply appended &callback=? to the Url
[14:15:56] <ali1234-v6> yes, it does
[14:16:08] <ali1234-v6> care to explain why that makes it work?
[14:16:10] <hugo_moss> when i copy paste code from one file to another, it invalidates the parenthesis. but if i copy it letter by letter its fine
[14:16:29] <systemfault> By adding callback=? to the url, it tells jQuery to get JSONP instead of normal JSONP
[14:16:31] <systemfault> Err
[14:16:35] <systemfault> normal JSON
[14:16:43] <b-lew> http://pastie.org/7166152 -> this is working perfectly on the ID but I have other elements that have galleries too and am only seeing a static image. any ideas for this to work with any element that has a .royalslider in it.
[14:17:37] <systemfault> ali1234-v6: JSONP is a function call, you get javascript: Try to go to http://gdata.youtube.com/feeds/api/videos/0-wPMwK5-zw?v=2&alt=jsonc&callback=lol to see how it works, you should see lol(jsonheree);
[14:17:59] <ali1234-v6> so is this done by jquery or the server?
[14:18:27] <systemfault> ali1234-v6: Both, jQuery has to send a callback name and the server formats the response using that callback name
[14:19:05] <systemfault> JSONP is a hack around the same-origin policy restriction
[14:19:16] <ali1234-v6> ah well, ok. this does make IE9 print "OK" however the returned json only contains an error message, not the api data i wanted
[14:19:54] <ali1234-v6> however, specifying something as callback name does work. so i'm totally confused
[14:20:41] <b-lew> Can anyone lend a hand?
[14:20:43] <systemfault> ali1234-v6: So http://jsfiddle.net/XtnGm/6/ doesn't work on IE9? You get undefined?
[14:21:22] <ali1234-v6> no, it works fine :(
[14:21:40] <systemfault> :/
[14:22:04] <ali1234-v6> but if i go directly to that url i get invalid parameter
[14:22:32] <systemfault> I don't get it :(
[14:22:58] <ali1234-v6> if i paste http://gdata.....callback=? into firefox, the json data is just an error: invalid parameter
[14:23:05] <ali1234-v6> http://gdata.youtube.com/feeds/api/videos/0-wPMwK5-zw?v=2&alt=jsonc&callback=? <- that
[14:23:13] <systemfault> Sure it won't work….
[14:23:27] <systemfault> As ? is replaced by something else by jQuery
[14:23:35] <ali1234-v6> oh i see
[14:23:38] <systemfault> Usually.. it's something like jQuery834829748275
[14:23:40] <ali1234-v6> fair enough then
[14:23:50] <systemfault> Write test instead of the ?
[14:24:12] <ali1234-v6> yes i see that it puts it into a named object
[14:25:15] <ali1234-v6> reading the docs now, thanks
[14:25:55] <Andrew_R> does anyone here have recommendation for a autocomplete select/dropdown plugin that loads data through ajax dynamically?
[14:26:21] <ilteris_> http://www.smrxt.com/smrxt-intro/intro.html can someone tell me how can I reset the form here after press submit, so I don't have to display the "Thanks for contacting us. …" Text when I open it next time?
[14:26:48] <foo> If I have a parent page, with an iframe in it, can I (from the parent page) change content within a div within the iframe? Both are on different domain, although same server.
[14:27:48] <Andrew_R> don't ask why, but I apparently have to deal with a select that contains over 25k items...
[14:29:56] <eddiemonge> why?
[14:30:09] <eddiemonge> foo: same domain sure
[14:31:12] <Andrew_R> can I blame it on the DBA's?
[14:31:34] <foo> eddiemonge: even if not permanent, just a temporary adjustment of code is fine
[14:31:50] <foo> eddiemonge: that's the way this system works. I *might* be able to do div instead of iframe and just everything there... hmm.
[14:31:54] <djQuery> Andrew_R, jqueryui.autocomplete can do it
[14:32:30] <foo> eddiemonge: If it's a pain to do because of 2 different domains, then maybe this won't work. I wasn't sure how possible it was to target an iframe and then a div within the page inside of it
[14:32:45] <djQuery> andrew_r http://jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#remote
[14:32:54] <djQuery> Andrew_R, ^
[14:34:08] <djQuery> Andrew_R, http://api.jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#option-source
[14:34:56] <djQuery> Andrew_R, might want to look at this example as well http://jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#remote-jsonp
[14:34:57] <Andrew_R> djQuery: thank you, I didn't know they had that in there.
[14:35:47] <Andrew_R> no need for jsonp, it will be on the same domain
[14:36:27] <djQuery> Andrew_R, but the jsonp one gives more detailed optiosn for the prameters
[14:36:52] <Andrew_R> yes it does, thanks
[14:37:05] <djQuery> Andrew_R, and how to deal with the data if it is not in the same format as what autocomplete needs it in
[14:38:05] <Andrew_R> that will be important, I will need value = data.id and label = data.name
[14:38:13] <s3b`> Hey when you're coding, what would be the best way to format
[14:38:13] <s3b`> $columnheader.append( $("<th>").text( models[i].name ).attr( "group", models[i].id ));
[14:38:23] <s3b`> a line like that? is there jquery conventions for style?
[14:38:56] <foo> eddiemonge: so, sounds like iframe + different domains is going to be a pain or impossible?
[14:39:26] <eddiemonge> foo: yeah
[14:39:52] <Andrew_R> s3b`: I'd probably split that into two lines for readability. var $th = $("<th>")...; $columnheader.append($th);
[14:40:13] <s3b`> Andrew_R I was thinking that as well
[14:41:13] <systemfault> s3b`: You can also use that syntax http://jsfiddle.net/b8usU/
[14:41:34] <eddiemonge> columnheader.append( $("<th group='"+models[i].id+"'>"+models[i].name+"</th>");
[14:42:02] <s3b`> you can do that? Wow alright
[14:42:07] <s3b`> I like that much more
[14:42:42] <ilteris_> I don't know if this is the proper place to ask this question: does anyone know the proper way to "reset" my form here? http://www.smrxt.com/smrxt-intro/intro.html Currently,  it displays "Thanks for contacting us. We'll contact you shortly." and not reset to the initial state.
[14:42:42] <s3b`> one more, dealing with new lines: http://hastebin.com/maquxekuve.jquery
[14:42:59] <eddiemonge> s3b`: that should have been  columnheader.append( "<th group='"+models[i].id+"'>"+models[i].name+"</th>");
[14:43:17] <ilteris_> this is what the developer did to display that text: http://pastie.org/7166422 I would like it to go back to initial form state after closed though.
[14:43:44] <ilteris_> I would really appreciate any directions here
[14:44:01] <ilteris_> complete newbie.
[14:44:52] <eddiemonge> ilteris_: best advice i can give would be to learn javascript
[14:45:18] <foo> eddiemonge: thanks, we'll look into a div. I think we should be able to make that work.
[14:46:08] <eddiemonge> ilteris_: $form[0].reset();
[14:46:59] <ilteris_> eddiemonge: the problem is I think he is replacing the form div contactformright with the Thanks for contacting us. We'll contact you shortly. so, I need to build it back on the DOM I guess. right?
[14:47:57] <eddiemonge> ilteris_: or just hide the form and show the message in a separate part and show that then swap them
[14:48:05] <d34th4ck3r> Hello! I am trying to make similiar effect to this: http://googleforstudents.blogspot.in/?view=mosaic , ie on hover , the article box should zoom, can anyone give me pointers to start?
[14:49:09] <s3b`> d34th4ck3r: $.hover( function() { /* zoom */ }, function() { /* unzoom() */})
[14:49:14] <eddiemonge> d34th4ck3r: view source
[14:49:30] <s3b`> d34thh4ck3r: then look up $jquery animate
[14:50:24] <d34th4ck3r> s3b`: I am using the same thing, but when I zoom in one, the nearby node slides up.
[14:50:34] <d34th4ck3r> due to change in height and width
[14:50:52] <d34th4ck3r> I want to fix the near by node
[14:50:54] <s3b`> position relative/absolute the floating element
[14:51:26] <Andrew_R> ilteris_: location.reload(); -- oh wait that's not cool :)
[14:51:45] <d34th4ck3r> s3b`: I have given relative.
[14:51:45] <ilteris_> Andrew_R: what's that?
[14:51:56] <Andrew_R> refresh the whole page
[14:52:08] <d34th4ck3r> ilteris_: it is just reloading the page.
[14:52:30] <ilteris_> oh ok
[14:53:29] <okdamn> does someone knows how can i create a simple shake effect on element?
[14:53:55] <eddiemonge> okdamn: http://jqueryui.com/effect/
[14:54:05] <okdamn> ehehe no pls i do not use UI
[14:54:08] <Andrew_R> ilteris_: you cant do a $('.contactformright').html("..") and get what you had back later
[14:54:24] <okdamn> eddiemonge:  thanks but i do not use UI
[14:54:26] <okdamn> ;)
[14:54:38] <ilteris_> Andrew_R: I didn't do it :( I am not the developer. I am an iOS developer who's trying to fix this error.
[14:54:39] <Andrew_R> it would be better to have a div below the form like <div class="finalmessage" style="display: none;">Thanks for contacting</div>
[14:55:08] <Andrew_R> then do on submit $form.hide(); $('.contactformright').show();
[14:55:14] <eddiemonge> i feel like someone suggested that already lol
[14:55:25] <Andrew_R> someone did ^^
[14:55:37] <ilteris_> :) bear with me guys. I am little slow when it comes to web.
[14:56:04] <ilteris_> okay, so first let me create that div finalmessage
[14:56:06] <okdamn> i think css3 should help me
[14:56:48] <d34th4ck3r> s3b`: I can't get what exactly you mean by "position relative/absolute the floating element" , can you please elaborate ?
[14:56:49] <ilteris_> Andrew_R: actually I already see <div class="contactformright1"></div> there first time.
[14:57:02] <ilteris_> Andrew_R: not sure why the developer created that.
[14:57:38] <ilteris_> eddiemonge: can I just do $
[14:57:54] <s3b`> d34thh4ck3r: set your <div> with the picture in it to position: relative, and then on hover grab the picture, make a new div, set position: absolute to it and place it at top: 0 left : 0
[14:58:00] <Andrew_R> create a hidden div containing your thank you message, and instead of doing .html() like it does, hide your form and show your thank you div
[14:58:10] <gordian> hey guys, anyone know why my selection CSS isn't working on the hyphens in this --> http://jsfiddle.net/UQzEU/ ?
[14:58:12] <Andrew_R> eddiemonge: x3
[14:58:35] <gordian> seems to work in FF but not Chrome or Safari
[15:00:50] <eddiemonge> gordian: that is a lot of code
[15:01:06] <gordian> eddiemonge: it's https://github.com/bramstein/hypher
[15:02:23] <gordian> didn't want to hotlink
[15:02:27] <eddiemonge> gordian: ok still a lot of code
[15:03:34] <Andrew_R> "A small and fast JavaScript hyphenation engine."
[15:04:24] <eddiemonge> what does that even mean?
[15:05:16] <Andrew_R> like like module.exports.patterns, good stuff
[15:05:18] <ilteris_> Andrew_R: do you mind helping out a little bit here? http://jsfiddle.net/gAJxw/
[15:05:46] <xob> hi, can someone help me with this: http://jsfiddle.net/hGNA9/
[15:05:53] <ilteris_> Andrew_R: I am trying to make the .finalMessage class's display:none to display:block on the press event
[15:06:14] <xob> all it needs to do is take the size, multiply by 5000, and add that to 10000 for each checked checkbox; and update the cost span with the result
[15:06:25] <ilteris_> can I just do $('finalMessage').show()?
[15:08:02] <anew> does .click() sometimes not register a form submit?
[15:08:08] <anew> i have prevent default on a button of a form
[15:08:13] <anew> and .click() sometimes fires sometimes doesnt
[15:08:19] <anew> is there a better thing to use in that sutionat?
[15:08:22] <anew> *situation
[15:08:22] <xob> use .submit() for the form itself
[15:08:25] <eddiemonge> anew: use .on('submit') to control a form
[15:08:42] <anew> will that work even if i'm not submitting the form? i'm doing it via ajax
[15:10:47] <Andrew_R> ilteris_: something like this will get you on your way, http://jsfiddle.net/gAJxw/1/
[15:12:00] <Andrew_R> anew: yes, don't handle the button, rather catch the form submit event and preventDefault() there.
[15:12:09] <eddiemonge> ilteris_: http://jsfiddle.net/gAJxw/2/
[15:12:15] <anew> ok let me try that
[15:13:56] <xob> can anyone answer my question?
[15:14:59] <eddiemonge> xob: i think you need to simplify your example first. there is a lot going on
[15:15:00] <brend_> lol
[15:15:22] <brend_> need a beer
[15:16:03] <xob> eddiemonge: the only part that really needs examining is the function at the bottom
[15:16:11] <shoky> xob: what's the question?
[15:16:12] <eddiemonge> xob: can you split that off then?
[15:17:46] <brend_> shoky:  do you mind helping me out with a fiddle
[15:18:01] <shoky> xob: and you probably don't want to multiply $size as that's a jquery object.. can't multiply those
[15:18:30] <shoky> brend_: that's what this channel is for
[15:19:11] <brend_> shoky:  try adding rows and select different projects http://jsfiddle.net/N7hjD/5/
[15:19:12] <shoky> xob: er and also it's not in scope where you're using it
[15:19:47] <eddiemonge> xob: i think you want size and not $size
[15:19:56] <xob> right
[15:20:08] <eddiemonge> and when i say size i mean $("#size").find(":selected").val()
[15:21:34] <xob> shoky: right, i wondered about that
[15:21:38] <xob> eddiemonge: ok, i updated it
[15:24:31] <shoky> brend_:  different projects?
[15:25:52] <brend_> shoky:  if u add a second row and then u select lets say project2 in the autocomplete.. it will bring up the values from the first row
[15:26:14] <xob> eddiemonge: any other suggestions?
[15:27:28] <shoky> brend_: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/N7hjD/6/
[15:28:11] <shoky> brend_:  when you do something like $('.tableProject').val(something)  it changes the value for all .tableProject's
[15:28:47] <brend_> shoky:  what have u done
[15:28:48] <brend_> ?
[15:29:15] <shoky> brend_: changed your code
[15:29:30] <brend_> shoky:  ohhhhhhhh now i get it
[15:29:54] <brend_> thanks man
[15:31:18] <brend_> shoky:  what if i have the autocomplete in a function outside there?
[15:32:46] <anew> http://pastebin.com/NSdBt0xu
[15:32:51] <anew> can anyone help me with this ajax call back
[15:33:00] <anew> i'm trying to switch out the headers, from not logged in to logged in
[15:33:04] <anew> what is the best way to do that
[15:36:06] <shoky> brend_: what do you mean? why would it be outside
[15:37:27] <shoelessone> so, what plugin should i use for making for make a news slider thing that slides up/down
[15:37:29] <brend_> shoky:  nevermind.. where i add the rows i call projectAutocompletes(); instead of doing all the stuff there
[15:37:42] <shoelessone> like, you know, a frame with some <li> inside that go up and down when you go to a new news item
[15:37:50] <shoelessone> i would just build it, but
[15:40:21] <anew> shoky what do u think about that link
[15:41:50] <shoky> anew: i don't know what you want me to say about it
[15:41:57] <anew> lol
[15:42:13] <anew>  i am trying to switch out the header from not logged in to logged in
[15:42:24] <shoky> "the header"
[15:42:27] <anew> so on ajax succes, not sure what to do
[15:42:33] <shoky> why should i know?
[15:42:35] <anew> i mean the banner header
[15:42:47] <anew> why shoud you know ?
[15:42:56] <anew> i thought it was an easy question
[15:43:01] <shoky> as if i have any idea what header you're talking about, on what page, what #nav is, what HeaderView.Header() is
[15:43:10] <shoky> pfft.
[15:43:30] <anew> i mean shouldnt .empty() just take out the div
[15:43:36] <anew> and i could replace it with a new one after that?
[15:43:41] <anew> that simple thing is not working
[15:43:43] <shoky> the only thing i can say is... async: false  is very stinky
[15:44:03] <anew> stinky
[15:44:23] <shoky> what div? wtf are you talking about
[15:44:31] <anew> bleh will make a fiddle
[15:44:40] <shoky> thank you
[15:45:33] <shoky> "i thought it was an easy question"
[15:45:37] <shoky> you're incredible
[15:47:15] <shoky> also.. if you're asking about switching some header.. why are you pasting ajax code? how is that relevant
[15:47:39] <anew> http://jsfiddle.net/dA4x2/
[15:47:41] <anew> shoky
[15:47:52] <anew> yeah i thought it was an easy question
[15:48:11] <anew> so the ajax call on success i need to change from header-n to header-loggedin
[15:48:20] <anew> i try to empty header-n
[15:48:26] <anew> but then after .empty() not sure
[15:48:33] <eddiemonge> i think you want hide and show
[15:49:05] <anew> hmmm ok will try that
[15:49:08] <anew> thx ed

[16:02:18] <YammYcoding> guys is that a way to hide that 'powered by google' from the google maps, when you embed the map on your page?
[16:02:35] <YammYcoding> i tried display none the div, but didn't work.
[16:04:09] <d34th4ck3r> sahbeewah: Not actually, I'm trying to make an effect similar to http://googleforstudents.blogspot.in/?view=mosaic
[16:04:20] <sahbeewah> YammYcoding, pretty sure that's against google's terms and conditions
[16:04:47] <anew> yean ahd why hide it, everyone KNOWS it's google maps
[16:05:25] <YammYcoding> it's uggly ><
[16:06:22] <al-p> hey
[16:06:28] <al-p> someone awake to help me out
[16:07:01] <sahbeewah> d34th4ck3r, you can't begin ids with a number
[16:07:03] <YammYcoding> but there is a way to hide it? when i hide with firebug it works
[16:07:11] <sahbeewah> therefore the css is invalid
[16:07:35] <al-p> seems like not
[16:07:37] <codacoder> hello, world
[16:08:15] <codacoder> can someone possibly help with an attr selector?
[16:08:32] <sup3rus3r> Hi, trying to use something like, $('#contextBar').hide('slide', { direction: 'left' }, 500);, but appears to do nothing
[16:08:52] <eddiemonge> sup3rus3r: did you include jqueryui slide effect?
[16:08:52] <sup3rus3r> codacoder: wwhat is it
[16:09:16] <codacoder> $("[data-we-gv-header-name]") returns [ ] when it should be populated
[16:09:41] <al-p> guys take a look at my navigation and tell me what's missing -> http://infives.com
[16:09:50] <codacoder> are data attrs supported in this context?
[16:09:52] <al-p> shrink down to mobile size and toggle to see what i'm talkin about
[16:10:12] <eddiemonge> codacoder: yes. but is there an element that matches that at the time you are calling it?
[16:10:22] <codacoder> absolutely
[16:10:55] <codacoder> paste from firebug: $.data($th[0])      Object { weGvHeaderName=  "ME_NAME"  }
[16:11:06] <sup3rus3r> eddiemonge: no,b ut I do have a bunch of other easing functions defined which I amtrying, e.g. easeOutQuad, I get this error when it fires my bound event, but no error when I type the command directly in console, Uncaught TypeError: Property '#<Object>' of object #<Object> is not a function
[16:11:24] <eddiemonge> codacoder: what is that?
[16:11:36] <sup3rus3r> eddiemonge: but regardless, I need jquery-ui ?
[16:11:44] <codacoder> the content of a TH's data attr
[16:11:55] <eddiemonge> sup3rus3r: if you want to use jqueryui effects then yes
[16:12:11] <eddiemonge> codacoder: example?
[16:12:28] <codacoder> eddie: ex of what?
[16:13:08] <eddiemonge> codacoder: your code
[16:13:11] <sup3rus3r> so animate isnt jquery ui
[16:14:29] <codacoder> I pasted the result above - on the one hand jQ is saying empty, on the other it says it's there.  The "broken" one is the generic "has" call - it says there are no elements with the given data attr in the entire document
[16:14:46] <codacoder> which is not true
[16:15:20] <codacoder> it seems there is an issue with the jQ data object not managing html5 data attra properly
[16:17:17] <codacoder> let's say I have this html:  <div data-my-stuff="xxxxxxxx">...</div>
[16:17:47] <eddiemonge> sup3rus3r: animate is jquery
[16:17:48] <codacoder> the question is, how to select all data-my-stuff
[16:18:25] <codacoder> I thought it was $("[data-my-stuff]") but it returns an empty array
[16:19:00] <eddiemonge> codacoder: looks like it works to me: http://jsfiddle.net/NeBA3/
[16:19:23] <defaultro> damn, I lost my job today :(
[16:20:36] <sup3rus3r> eddiemonge: thanks for your help
[16:20:52] <sup3rus3r> my custom easing functions arent working, which work with animate, is 'slide' not an easing function ?
[16:21:16] <sup3rus3r> apparent its not, my bad :D
[16:21:48] <sup3rus3r> surprised you cant use them with 'slide'
[16:22:36] <eddiemonge> sup3rus3r: it is, in jqui
[16:22:44] <eddiemonge> defaultro: that sucks
[16:23:17] <sup3rus3r> eddiemonge: is there some way to use an easing function with show( 'slide',... ) that i'm missing ?
[16:23:56] <defaultro> eddiemonge, yup :(
[16:24:10] <defaultro> i'll have to call HR on monday to know if it's fire or layoff
[16:24:22] <codacoder> eddie: damn... somethings weird about this code, clearly... thanks anyway
[16:24:27] <eddiemonge> sup3rus3r: take a look at http://jqueryui.com/effect/
[16:28:20] <sup3rus3r> eddiemonge: ty
[16:30:11] <elementz> hi all. this must be a very simple problem, I get the following error: "Uncaught ReferenceError: $ is not defined" https://gist.github.com/jottr/11afd69ffe4c58702316
[16:30:24] <elementz> Maybe somebody could have a look?
[16:30:59] <codacoder> eddie: still here?
[16:31:34] <shoky> elementz:  seems to work fine.. http://jsbin.com/evaruv/1/edit
[16:32:07] <elementz> shoky: thats really strange. it does not work when i open it in chrome
[16:32:38] <eddiemonge> elementz: is the script loading correctly for you? as in no 404 or anything in console?
[16:32:57] <codacoder> can someone tell me if there is a difference between html5 data attrs and adding to jquery's data object?
[16:33:42] <codacoder> it seems if values added to jQ's data object, they cant be found via an attr selector - am I correct?
[16:33:49] <shoky> elementz:  i guess it's cause you're opening a file from the local filesystem, add http: to jquery's url and it'll prolly work
[16:34:26] <elementz> shoky: no, thats the correct way of referencing jqery on google cdn
[16:34:41] <shoky> elementz: from a site hosted on a webserver, yes
[16:34:48] <elementz> shoky: ah damn
[16:35:39] <elementz> shoky: thx. now it works
[16:36:54] <ilteris_> hey eddiemonge are you still around please?
[16:37:04] <codacoder> someone?
[16:37:50] <codacoder> how do I write a selector to search jQ data object?
[16:37:50] <shoky> codacoder: jq's  .data() will only read from the data-xxx attributes one time
[16:38:02] <eddiemonge> codacoder: right
[16:38:10] <eddiemonge> html5 stores its attributes in the dom
[16:38:12] <codacoder> shoky: what does "one time" mean?
[16:38:17] <eddiemonge> jquery puts data in memory
[16:38:18] <shoky> codacoder:  jquery-ui has such a selector
[16:38:32] <codacoder> shoky: dont have ui
[16:38:42] <shoky> codacoder:  it means one time, the first time you call .data() on the element, i think
[16:38:59] <eddiemonge> codacoder: data in jq's data object is put there manually so you know whats there already
[16:39:05] <shoky> codacoder: and jquery's .data() can have any datatype unlike the attributes
[16:39:06] <codacoder> so... if I've added via .data(), I can't call $("[blah]") - is that write?
[16:39:22] <shoky> codacoder: that's right. writing to .data() doesn't affect any attributes
[16:39:43] <codacoder> damn...
[16:39:47] <ilteris_> hey guys, can I ask for a favor? when you press submit here after filling out the form, does it close the form div area for you? https://www.smrxt.com/
[16:39:49] <shoky> codacoder:  one thing you can do is use .filter()  passing a function to it
[16:40:14] <codacoder> it's not the values I'm querying... I want all elements that have the attr
[16:40:31] <shoky> it's not an attr if you're writing it with .data()
[16:40:33] <codacoder> except we're saying it isn't an attr
[16:40:41] <codacoder> yep - got it
[16:40:46] <codacoder> she-it
[16:41:06] <codacoder> so, pass a fn to filter?
[16:41:24] <shoky> that'd work
[16:41:29] <xenoterracide> http://privatepaste.com/e8a6947da6 getting "parsererror SyntaxError {}" it says at line 34 which is the console.log inside the error handler
[16:41:43] <codacoder> excellent... thanks shoky
[16:42:20] <eddiemonge> xenoterracide: IE?

[16:42:54] <eddiemonge> xenoterracide: your click event should really be a submit event attached to the form
[16:43:28] <ilteris_> hey guys, I am really desperate here :(
[16:44:18] <ilteris_> for some reason after I press submit, the box should animate to close but it doesn't. https://www.smrxt.com/  anyone have any idea why?
[16:47:37] <ilteris_> I think it's something very simple but I cannot find it
[16:48:16] <hugo_moss> $self.hide().attr("src", $self.data(settings.data_attribute))[settings.effect](settings.effect_speed);
[16:48:24] <hugo_moss> can someone tell me how that line of code is working?
[16:48:48] <hugo_moss> $self is a jquery object, and settings.effect is "fadeIn"
[16:49:01] <hugo_moss> anyone have a good resource for learning about jquery objects
[16:49:13] <echoee> gday guys
[16:49:15] <hugo_moss> i dont understand where that array property is coming from
[16:49:46] <echoee> does anyone have a good fix to the delays in touching on checkbox/radio?
[16:50:17] <codacoder> shoky: easier answer was to add the thing via .attr("data-my-stuff") that way it exists in the html5 attr and the jQ data object
[16:50:36] <xenoterracide> eddiemonge that doesn't seem to help
[16:51:42] <xenoterracide> in fact in changing it it seems the code inside is never executed
[16:58:54] <eddiemonge> xenoterracide: it wont if jQuery isnt defined
[17:03:39] <hugo_moss> where can i see a comprehensive list of dom event types?
[17:05:04] <xenoterracide> eddiemonge I import jquery higher on the page
[17:05:22] <eddiemonge> are you loading any other libraries or using noconflict?
[17:05:27] <xenoterracide> nope
[17:05:39] <xenoterracide> and some parts of the code execute
[17:06:10] <xenoterracide> there's actually not much more to the code other than a simple <head> with a jquery import
[17:08:59] <eddiemonge> xenoterracide: code again? and preferably a live site where it isnt working
[17:10:02] <hugo_moss> eddiemonge: is it possible to call a jquery effect method using a jquery objects properties?
[17:10:14] <xenoterracide> http://privatepaste.com/6f04765b89 sorry, don't have a host to put the backend on at this time
[17:10:35] <eddiemonge> hugo_moss: huh?
[17:11:05] <eddiemonge> xenoterracide: whats the exact problem again?
[17:11:28] <hugo_moss> because i dont understand how this is calling .fadeIn(): $jq191("<img />").bind("load", function() {$self.hide().attr("src", $self.data(settings.data_attribute))[settings.effect](settings.effect_speed);
[17:11:41] <hugo_moss> $self is a jquery object
[17:13:14] <xenoterracide> eddiemonge this is my full console.log output http://privatepaste.com/90566d04ed
[17:14:00] <xenoterracide> I'm sure it's something stupid
[17:14:02] <eddiemonge> xenoterracide: what is all that?
[17:14:03] <xenoterracide> but I don't see it
[17:14:48] <xenoterracide> s my full console.log output
[17:14:52] <xenoterracide> debugging statements
[17:14:54] <xenoterracide> nvm
[17:15:12] <abjorn> looks like the backends borkin it up
[17:19:19] <xenoterracide> backend is returning a 201
[17:29:08] <sadtaco> http://jsbin.com/eliley/1/edit I'm trying to make something to match psuedo-code in strings.  I need to get the argument, and the part between curly brackets. It works, except with nesting.  I think the big problemwhen it comes to the nesting is that it's matching to the first "}" it hits instead of the nest it's actually for.
[17:29:25] <sadtaco> I'm trying to actually find this psuedocode so I can parse it like code.
[17:32:18] <echoee> hi guys, wonder if anyone can help me out on a little issue
[17:32:34] <vladikoff> echoee, go head
[17:32:41] <vladikoff> echoee, ahead*
[17:32:43] <echoee> i have a checkbox, which works elsewhere without any issue, but on iOS touch devices
[17:32:58] <nickmeagher> link?
[17:32:58] <echoee> it doesnt seem to register th change in its state properly
[17:34:22] <sadtaco> hm nevermind I think I got it..
[17:34:36] <hugo_moss> how is this calling .fadeIn(): $jq191("<img />").bind("load", function() {$self.hide().attr("src", $self.data(settings.data_attribute))[settings.effect](settings.effect_speed);
[17:34:44] <sadtaco> though it's not ideal :/
[17:35:18] <sadtaco> So if anyone else knows a solution, I could still use it
[18:00:40] <hugo_moss> is there such a thing as a fadeIn property of the jquery object returned by .attr?
[18:19:15] <eddiemonge> console.log(   $self.hide().attr("src", $self.data(settings.data_attribute))[settings.effect]   ); hugo_moss
[18:20:16] <hugo_moss> thanks eddie
[18:20:24] <hugo_moss> i asked on SO too
[18:20:53] <hugo_moss> i didnt know that calling a string as a property of a javascript object, is the same as calling the method named by that string
[19:01:09] <harrydog> if i assign a variable in my function $ = jQuery, will that essentially be the same as passing jQuery to my main function parameter?
[19:01:13] <whyrusleeping> Im attempting to make a div autoscroll to the bottom unless the user has scrolled up. and ive got this code, that i think should work, but isnt quite. http://jsfiddle.net/XS3kf/
[19:01:22] <harrydog> (to avoid conflict with other libraries)
[19:01:53] <aghouseh> trying to get flexSlider working nicely with magento (which uses prototype), and ive got my stuff properly scoped, but i'm still getting .flexSlider() is not a function..
[19:01:55] <aghouseh> http://pastebin.com/qV035jUG
[19:02:13] <aghouseh> im sure its something obvious, but i cant sort it out
[19:03:16] <harrydog> whyrusleeping, does jquery natively support scrolling to certain points? you might need an extra library or to create a function that scrolls it
[19:03:59] <whyrusleeping> well, i have other code that autoscrolls it to the bottom... im having trouble getting it to toggle
[19:05:17] <harrydog> whyrusleeping, you might want to check out this http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4249353/jquery-scroll-to-bottom-of-the-page
[19:05:56] <whyrusleeping> yeah, i can do that much already.
[19:06:16] <whyrusleeping> my problem is not autoscrolling when the user scrolls up manually
[19:06:44] <aghouseh> cancel your autoscroll if a scroll event fires?
[19:07:05] <whyrusleeping> how though?
[19:07:17] <whyrusleeping> (also, need to resume autoscroll if they scroll to the bottom again)
[19:07:30] <aghouseh> yea not sure about that. have to do some digging
[19:36:41] <nook> Hi, i want to retunr the responseText of an AjaxRequest, but i only get "undefined" thats mya code, but y? http://pastebin.com/ZZwFWJpu
[19:39:20] <smakatak> i have this piece of code: $('#tbodyID td:nth-child(3)').each(function(){...some stuff}); which loops the 3 column of rows. inside the loop i can access the text value of a <td> element by using $(this).text(). how can i access some random row element without looping?
[19:39:51] <smakatak> i tried $('#tbodyID td:nth-child(3)').eq(5).text() but that doesn't work
[19:41:06] <smakatak> shouldn't .eq(x) return the xth row element?
[19:47:14] <nook> no one has a solution for my problme? :)
[20:05:24] <nook> Hi, i want to return the responseText of an AjaxRequest, but i only get "undefined" thats my code: http://pastebin.com/ZZwFWJpu But y it dont work?
[20:15:59] <MaxM> how do I select a obj value by the number in an array, ex obj.keys[5th key in obj]
[20:31:38] <nitrix> obj.keys[5] ......
[20:32:00] <nitrix> obj[5] actually.
[20:32:33] <nitrix> If you want the 5th, that'd be obj[4].
[20:32:42] <nitrix> Since indexes starts at 0.
[20:43:10] <scar> is there something similar to on('hover') for a long-hover? say, only if the user hovers and holds will it react?
[20:47:45] <shoky> `g hoverIntent
[20:47:46] <b-ot> shoky: hoverIntent jQuery Plug-in → http://cherne.net/brian/resources/jquery.hoverIntent.html
[20:48:00] <shoky> scar ^ maybe that'll help
[20:48:09] <scar> hm
[20:48:14] <scar> im sure it will :)
[20:48:18] <scar> sounds familiar
[21:10:16] <JRizzle> Hello

[21:43:00] <JRizzle> can anyone suggest where to look for remote jobs?
[21:43:04] <JRizzle> contract or hourly
[21:43:41] <alainus> how do i make sure a code is executed on the .click() event? I'm using stopPropagation, and preventDefault(), but there's an ajax call that keeps happening before my script.
[21:55:51] <firedfox> alainus, maybe some function is triggered by mousedown or mouseup event?
[21:57:54] <firedfox> alainus, or you can check jquery events: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/570960/how-to-debug-javascript-jquery-event-bindings-with-firebug-or-similar-tool
[22:13:09] <ruby_on_tails> anyone alive ?
[22:14:39] <didiergm> yep
[22:14:55] <tw2113> TypeError alive is not defined
[22:16:18] <ruby_on_tails> hmm
[22:16:42] <ruby_on_tails> what does dev channels mean ?
[22:16:50] <tw2113> jQuery core development

[22:26:18] <relipse>  how do i take a string and insert "\D" between each character, so for example '12345' becomes '1\D2\D3\D4\D5'
[22:26:55] <tw2113> ?split
[22:27:01] <tw2113> come on
[22:27:14] <tw2113> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/split
[22:28:25] <tw2113> a step in the right direction at least
[22:42:59] <firedfox> '12345'.replace(/(.)/g, '$1\\D')
[22:44:43] <firedfox> relipse, i think it's the most simple one
[22:50:17] <firedfox> relipse, i didn't notice 'between'. this is the correct one: '12345'.replace(/(.(?!$))/g, '$1\\D')

[23:17:21] <MaxM> someone please help me with this, I've spent nearly all day trying to figure out a way around this. hope its simple http://jsfiddle.net/4tuyQ/
[23:18:18] <imsky> MaxM, use obj()
[23:21:02] <MaxM> ok, I need to take a long break and see if I really want to try and make it as a programmer
[23:21:09] <MaxM> seriously 8 hours wasted
[23:21:20] <goran_> haha
[23:21:27] <tw2113> you're going to run into that sometimes if you want to be a programmer
[23:21:28] <goran_> shit happens
[23:21:43] <tw2113> the really good programmers take those moments as challenges
[23:21:46] <tw2113> and problems to solve
[23:22:09] <MaxM> I thought it was a hundred different fuckn things man, until I made this fiddle, I've been messing with the code forever
[23:22:35] <tw2113> yup, sounds about right
[23:22:59] <MaxM> ok, new rule, 30 mins of no results, time to make fiddle
[23:23:07] <MaxM> thanks again guys
[23:23:28] <tw2113> so you're not giving up yet?
[23:23:30] <tw2113> yay!
[23:23:35] * tw2113 saved a person today
[23:23:58] <goran_> anybody knows how can i get rid of the span created in the jquery ui 1.10 autocomplete ?
[23:38:31] <vladikoff> goran_, the 'status' span ?
[23:39:02] <vladikoff> goran_, http://api.jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#method-destroy maybe these API methods will help you
[23:40:30] <goran_> vladikoff: ill check that out
[23:45:54] <goran_> vladikoff: http://jsfiddle.net/ukHZa/
[23:46:45] <goran_> vladikoff:  using this.next() it wont let you set the value cuz it always creates a span next to the field
