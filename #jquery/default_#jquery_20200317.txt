[08:43:57] <snatcher> is there a way to get css property value of specific class?
[09:27:37] <Cork> snatcher: yes, but you will have to work with the stylesheets object
[09:27:54] <Cork> document.stylesheets
[11:18:41] <snatcher> https://jsfiddle.net/cxyok4nw/ why slideToggle cut off box-shadow while sliding? is there a way to fix such a behavior?
[12:06:22] <snatcher> can add fixed margin/padding size specific to box-shadow but it's really annoying to maintain every row
[12:39:00] <ThLoser> Anyone can tell me why .data not working but .attr working? https://pastebin.com/bDcrc4UJ
[12:43:18] <snatcher> ThLoser: https://api.jquery.com/data/ >Using the data() method to update data does not affect attributes in the DOM. To set a data-* attribute value, use attr.
[12:44:58] <ThLoser> Thank u for that good answer dear snatcher !
[12:45:47] <robertmaxrees> even better - use .data() to write AND read the value.
[12:46:12] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/14rxosLg/
[12:48:55] <ThLoser> robertmaxrees And now u lost me. I can't update the data? But i can write data?
[12:50:09] <robertmaxrees> you can.
[12:50:36] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/14rxosLg/3/
[12:50:59] <robertmaxrees> .data() uses a special cache so that you don't have to touch the DOM each time.
[12:51:36] <robertmaxrees> so long as you're consistent and just use .data() always, you're fine.  The only limitation is you can't verify by looking at the element inspector.
[12:52:55] <robertmaxrees> ThLoser
[12:53:02] <ThLoser> yy?
[12:53:09] <robertmaxrees> ?
[12:53:15] <robertmaxrees> what does "yy?" mean?
[12:53:21] <ThLoser> Yes yes?
[12:53:30] <ThLoser> U "highlighted" me
[12:53:38] <robertmaxrees> Yeah - did you read what I typed out?
[12:53:55] <ThLoser> Yes, im trying to solve it at the same time
[12:54:19] <ThLoser> And like u said, i cant verify it by looking at the inspector like i always did >_<
[12:55:54] <robertmaxrees> yep :) just gotta use .data() for both parts.  ezpz :)
[12:57:52] <ThLoser> Thanks so much for the help! Maybe now u can answer another one if u are having a boring time :P  This is my data $("button").data("infoarray", {"name":"ThisName", "pot":"ThisPot"}); Is it now possible to add more text to just that data-infoarray, from another part?
[12:59:12] <robertmaxrees> sure, though it's a little roundabout.
[13:00:19] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/14rxosLg/
[13:00:26] <robertmaxrees> also: you don't have an array there - that's an object.
[13:00:53] <ThLoser> Oh true :p  lets see what u have magical done :p
[13:06:35] <ThLoser> omg its working thank u! :D
[13:07:17] <robertmaxrees> be careful with how much data you're popping in there.  might make more sense to slap some kind of identifier on there and have a JS object elsewhere with whatever you need.
