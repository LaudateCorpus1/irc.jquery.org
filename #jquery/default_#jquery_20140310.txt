[00:18:05] <Starcraftmazter> does jquery have a down() equivilent of left() and right() ? how else can i achieve this?
[00:18:14] <Starcraftmazter> i just need to push a div down, no effect or anything, just pure positioning
[00:19:43] <jop008> is there a selectlist avail where you can reorder the items?
[00:26:03] <Cork> Starcraftmazter: jquery doesn't have any left or right either
[00:26:27] <Cork> Starcraftmazter: those things are controlled by changing the css top, left values
[00:50:32] <murosai> how can i disable my browser from automatically scrolling to a displayed jquery-ui dialog?
[00:51:19] <Cork> murosai: just guessing but but you prob are using a link and isn't preventing the default action
[00:51:29] <Cork> <a href="#something"></a>
[00:53:58] <jop008> what is a good way to trap a key?
[00:54:11] <jop008> I want to trap the Control R key
[00:54:20] <jop008> cross browser must be workin
[00:54:36] <Cork> trap it?
[00:54:46] <Cork> you can't really trap the key
[00:54:46] <murosai> Cork: what do you mean preventing the default action?
[00:54:53] <Cork> you can prevent it from having the default action
[00:54:58] <Cork> but not trap it in the page
[00:55:10] <Cork> murosai: event.preventDefault()
[00:55:41] <jop008> So it is not possible to trap key Control R in an input text field?
[00:56:08] <jop008> If Control R is pressed some special thing must be done
[00:56:17] <Cork> jop008: if you mean "force it to ever only fire to this element" then no
[00:56:31] <Cork> at least not cross browser
[00:56:48] <jop008> What a pitty
[00:57:03] <Cork> not really
[00:57:16] <Cork> it would be a super nice way to abuse the user
[00:57:29] <Cork> having a field where you trap the keyboard input
[00:57:29] <jop008> I am trying to build a nice dialogue where users can select multiple item from a list using autocomplete stuf
[00:57:38] <Cork> and then just have the user switch to there login page
[00:57:50] <Cork> jop008: ok?
[00:57:53] <jop008> when the user has select 3 items it must be possible to delete one
[00:58:11] <Cork> why do you have to trap the event to do that?
[00:58:21] <murosai> Cork: i'm not sure how links are even related to displaying a dialog
[00:58:38] <Cork> murosai: something has to run the .open() or .dialog() call
[00:58:45] <jop008> I have one field and when user enters Ctrl R he can rearange his items
[00:58:47] <Cork> the dialog isn't magically running
[00:59:03] <jop008> delete a few items from the already selected items
[00:59:04] <Cork> ok?
[00:59:19] <Cork> again what does that have to do with trapping?
[00:59:41] <jop008> I have it now running with this functionality A div container showing the selected options
[00:59:41] <Cork> trapping means the even can't be fired to anyone else until the event is untrapped
[01:00:04] <Cork> what you explain should work just find with bubbling and preventing the default action
[01:00:10] <jop008> The div container must be editable as well (to delete an option)
[01:00:11] <Cork> *fine
[01:01:03] <jop008> There is no nice select items dialogue combined with autocomplete
[01:01:17] <Cork> so set it on a parent
[01:01:28] <Cork> or heck set it on document
[01:02:12] <murosai> Cork: yup something is running the .dialog() call, but what about it?
[01:02:43] <Cork> murosai: that event is most likely triggered from a <a href="#something"></a> click event
[01:02:53] <Cork> but isn't killing the <a> default action
[01:03:05] <jop008> When a user hits a certain key some magic must be done that's why I need a key keeping my layout the same
[01:03:08] <Cork> the reason i assume this is that it is a quite common mistake
[01:03:26] <murosai> Cork: i see, but that's not the case here
[01:03:51] <Cork> murosai: then you need to provide an example of the problem
[01:03:57] <Cork> => jsfiddle.net
[01:12:39] <rgenito> how do i check if an item is on the web page? =\ if ($('#something')) always seems to be True
[01:13:13] <Cork> .length > 0
[01:13:23] <Cork> $() ALWAYS return a jquery object
[01:13:32] <Cork> so it is always truthy
[01:13:34] <rgenito> ahh
[01:13:36] <rgenito> thank you :)
[01:13:44] <rgenito> $('#something').length > 0 then?
[01:13:49] <Cork> yes
[01:14:00] <Cork> rgenito: note through
[01:14:09] <Cork> you normally don't need to do those kind of checks
[01:14:20] <jop008> Can you trap the contextmenu button of a mouse nicely?
[01:14:27] <jop008> I mean cross browser?
[01:14:39] <Cork> the reason jquery is returning an object is so it handles the missing elements
[01:14:54] <rgenito> Cork what do you mean normally dont need to do ?
[01:15:19] <rgenito> ...i want to add a .click() behavior to the button ... i guess i could add it whether the button exists on the page or not, eh?
[01:15:33] <Cork> rgenito: the only situation you need to check if an element exist is if you need to do a special thing in that case
[01:15:42] <Cork> rgenito: exactly
[01:15:48] <rgenito> thanks Cork :)
[01:16:00] <Cork> $('#something').click(function() {}) is safe to run
[01:16:15] <Cork> cause click will loop the array $('#something') gives it
[01:16:32] <Cork> and if the array is empty; well then there isn't anyting to loop
[01:16:35] <Cork> so it doesn't do anything
[01:17:00] <Cork> jop008: there is no context menu button
[01:17:17] <Cork> jop008: except if possibly mac has it; not sure there
[01:17:25] <Cork> but windows and linux doesn't have it
[01:17:50] <jop008> right mouse click I mean
[01:18:14] <Cork> jop008: again no you can't trap events normally
[01:18:21] <Cork> you can catch them as they are over the page
[01:18:33] <Cork> and some browsers let you trap the mouse
[01:18:38] <jop008> is there a difference?
[01:18:39] <Cork> (mainly to support games)
[01:18:57] <Cork> jop008: ex. trapping the mouse means it can't move outside the trapped element
[01:19:11] <Cork> or events is fired to the trapped element even if the mouse is moved outside it
[01:19:31] <jop008> so it is not tight to an elemant with onkeypress
[01:19:56] <Cork> you can't tie mouse events to keyboard events no
[01:20:11] <Cork> that you need to do in code
[01:22:52] <murosai> Cork: i'm not sure if it's possible to reproduce without iframes :/
[01:23:02] <jop008> is there a mouse equivalent on taphold?
[01:23:10] <jop008> taphold is on mobile
[01:23:19] <Cork> jop008: mousedown
[01:24:21] <jop008> but mousedown react immeadiately
[01:24:36] <Cork> if you want a delay you need to use a timer
[01:24:51] <Cork> the reason you have the delay on touch devices
[01:25:03] <Cork> is cause you don't have buttons there
[01:25:16] <jop008> yes I noticed !
[01:58:22] <Hyperking> is there an easy way to update a dom element after an event happens? I'm using minicart.js and looking to create a items in cart counter that updates when items are added or removed
[01:59:14] <Cork> Hyperking: the question is a little weird; but generically it should be no problem
[01:59:30] <fabioportieri> heatxsink: that's what event handlers are for
[02:00:42] <fabioportieri> sorry i meant Hyperking
[02:00:52] <Hyperking> Cork: so far im able to update when one event button is pressed, but the dom element doesn't update if more items are added...
[02:02:55] <Cork> Hyperking: your problem is most likely with the event not the element
[02:03:58] <Hyperking> Cork: right im working on a live example for review.
[02:08:21] <Hyperking> Cork:http://blackcard.dcglamstudio.com/
[02:08:47] <Cork> an error page?
[02:09:07] <Hyperking> no. refresh
[02:09:18] <Cork> still an error page
[02:09:23] <Cork> http 503
[02:09:36] <Hyperking> thats weird
[02:11:08] <Hyperking> Cork: try again
[02:12:05] <Cork> ok, and what should i be looking for?
[02:13:08] <Hyperking> if you click buy now, a number should appear next to "Show Cart" button
[02:13:16] <Cork> console.log(cartCount.count); doesn't make any sense btw
[02:13:42] <Hyperking> lol, i have no idea what im doing
[02:14:00] <Hyperking> trying to call a nested variable inside a function
[02:15:05] <Cork> all i get is "ReferenceError: paypal is not defined"
[02:15:10] <Cork> the button doesn't work
[02:15:12] <Hyperking> anyway. clicking on Show Cart button will update the total items in the cart
[02:16:47] <Cork> the only thing i can guess as is that the $('.showCart') element is replaced or something
[02:17:02] <Cork> might cause the showCart function to not fire
[02:17:14] <Cork> but ya, hard to say as it doesn't run
[02:17:36] <Hyperking> Cork: thats weird that its not running on your end??
[02:17:47] <Cork> "ReferenceError: paypal is not defined" <--
[02:17:55] <Cork> as the object is missing the page crashes
[02:18:24] <Hyperking> what browser are you using?
[02:18:55] <Cork> chrome and firefox
[02:19:21] <Hyperking> Cork: nevermind. looking at the source...gimme a sec to correct
[02:20:27] <Hyperking> Cork: try now.
[02:22:03] <Cork> ...
[02:22:15] <Cork> still gives me 503 ever other time something loads
[02:22:25] <Cork> ok, come again when you get the site working...
[02:22:59] <jop008> Can you also use this on an input text field? http://api.jquerymobile.com/taphold/
[02:23:02] <Hyperking> cork: ok...:-(
[02:23:38] <Cork> jop008: should
[02:24:04] <jop008> Okay nothing is happening when I try to test it :-(
[02:32:58] <Hyperking> cork: try this http://hyperking.webfactional.com/
[02:36:13] <Cork> Hyperking: well it "works here"
[02:36:36] <seutje> "Diva central glamour studio" oh man :')
[02:36:37] <Cork> not sure what you intend should update it, but if you click showcart > order new > show cart
[02:36:39] <Cork> you get 1
[02:37:15] <Cork> Hyperking: i don't see any other bindings that is to update the count
[02:37:38] <Cork> man des "encryption" makes you want to cry...
[02:38:06] <Hyperking> the api here https://github.com/jeffharrell/minicart suggests using paypal.minicart.cart.add() not sure how to implement it at this point
[02:38:51] <Hyperking> Cork: ^ what do you mean by des "encryption"??
[02:39:20] <Cork> Hyperking: no it looks like paypal.on('change', cartCount); is what you want
[02:39:28] <Cork> Hyperking: it isn't related to your page
[02:39:33] <Cork> (des i mean)
[02:39:49] <Cork> i'm working with a vnc project
[02:40:03] <Cork> and vnc uses d3des for password "encryption"
[02:40:10] <solarant> Hi, I have to create a list of items ( unread messages) which when clicked has to send a request to the correct url
[02:40:19] <solarant> I am assuming there must be some plugin already to do that
[02:40:31] <Hyperking> ok.. I am aware the cart isn't encrypted, so hackers could change the price..
[02:40:43] <Hyperking> cork: thanks for the help. Cheers
[02:40:45] <jop008> No alert on this   $('#' + this.fieldname + '_field' ).bind( "taphold", tapholdHandler );
[02:40:45] <jop008>   function tapholdHandler( event ){      alert ("cm");
[02:40:53] <jop008> on an ipad
[02:41:08] <Cork> solarant: you normally can't send requests to random urls
[02:41:09] <jop008> it is on an input text field
[02:41:26] <Armistice> Having a small issue when using toggle to animate the "right" property of an element. http://jsfiddle.net/hX73v/4/ for some reason when yo uclick the settings handle on the right.. it will move it in the opposite direction. It's supposed to change the "right" property to 0, so that it is in display.
[02:41:28] <Armistice> but doesn't.
[02:41:31] <Cork> jop008: you might be hit by the form field overlay thingy
[02:41:36] <solarant> Cork:  not to random urls :) Just urls with the correct id appended to the same domain
[02:41:51] <Cork> solarant: then i don't see why you need a plugin
[02:41:55] <Cork> it is like two lines of code
[02:42:03] <jop008> form field overlay things?
[02:43:03] <Cork> solarant: $('#parent-ul').on('click', 'li', function() { $.ajax('url', { type: 'get', data: { id: $(this).data('id') } } })
[02:43:31] <solarant> Cork: I am thinking of two ways to do it: 1. Every item has a on click set to call the correct url. 2. The on click on a specific container that can get the url or id for the clicked child controller
[02:43:33] <Cork> assuming the structure is <ul><li data-id="100"></li></ul>
[02:43:44] <solarant> Thank you Cork
[02:44:43] <Cork> jop008: mobiles puts an extra element ontop of form fields
[02:44:54] <Cork> and you actually edit this overlay element
[02:45:05] <Cork> and it fakes events on the real underlaying element and...
[02:45:09] <jop008> so what to do?
[02:45:20] <Cork> safari has a long list of bugs around this
[02:45:35] <Cork> jop008: well it might be why things fails for you
[02:45:57] <Cork> and can't really give you much hints how to solve it if that is the case
[02:46:14] <jop008> but I am trying to find a solution let the user use reight mouse clikc on a desktop and taphold on mbile
[02:46:19] <Cork> cause you need to tinker with quite specific workarounds to get around those bugs
[02:46:23] <jop008> Forget this and make a button?
[02:46:38] <Hyperking> Cork: what's the 'change' event for?
[02:46:41] <Cork> you would have to bug rest
[02:46:53] <Cork> Hyperking: read the api documentation you linked to
[02:47:56] <Hyperking> I am, I don't see 'change' anywhere.?? is this an event like 'click'?
[02:48:14] <Cork> Hyperking: try searching for it
[02:48:22] <Cork> it is quite close to the bottom of the page
[02:49:02] <Hyperking> Ok, i see, but this applies to a product not the cart
[02:50:31] <Cork> Hyperking: you need to know when the number of articles has changed
[02:50:38] <Cork> else you can't show the correct number
[02:51:03] <Cork> you prob want to bind the destroy event too
[02:51:15] <Cork> but i'm only guessing there
[02:51:15] <Hyperking> calling product.on('change', cartCount); doesn't do any thing tho??
[02:51:26] <Cork> uh, you don't call
[02:51:26] <Hyperking> Cork: me too lol
[02:51:27] <Cork> you bind
[02:51:47] <Hyperking> product.on.bind('change',cartCount); ??
[02:51:49] <Cork> and it sounds like you should read up on the plugin a bit more before using it
[02:51:52] <Cork> ...
[02:52:21] <Cork> Hyperking: try to figure out how the plugin works instead of throwing random objects around
[02:52:37] <Hyperking> Yeah, just don't know what im looking for as i do read
[02:52:58] <Cork> Hyperking: you might have to dive into the code to really understand it
[02:53:21] <Cork> but as the plugin handles adding/changin and removing products to the cart
[02:53:33] <Cork> you need to get called when this happens
[02:53:49] <Cork> from a skim reading it looks like the .on does this
[02:54:02] <Cork> but ya, you really need to figure the plugin out if you are to use it
[02:54:11] <Cork> else you are going to get pain in the future
[02:54:34] <Cork> page breaks > you sit and don't understand how things works > site stays down for ever cause you can't fix the problem
[02:54:47] <Cork> so you should never use a plugin you couldn't replace if you needed to
[02:55:16] <Cork> basically meaning, if you can't understand the plugin if you read the code
[02:55:23] <Cork> you most likely shouldn't use it
[02:55:51] <jop008> I want this <div field contain><label><input> and next to the input field a button how to arrange this?
[02:56:00] <Hyperking> Cork: nah! I don't understand any javascript so Im learning via failures.
[02:56:22] <Cork> Hyperking: sounds like you should start at he basics then
[02:56:58] <Hyperking> I can grasp code by reading it, but not sure how to call, bind, update "stuff like that" works in general
[02:57:08] <Hyperking> basics, yes!
[02:58:06] <Hyperking> im coming from php->python...javascript was my next battle
[02:58:17] <Hyperking> .challenge rather
[02:59:25] <Hyperking> Cork: thanks for the help and good advice
[03:00:04] <Cork> Hyperking: on, bind, update isn't magic things
[03:00:12] <Cork> it is properties on the object
[03:00:46] <Armistice> http://jsfiddle.net/hX73v/4/ - Why isn't the cog acting the way it should? It should become visible... but instead it hides even further.
[03:00:52] <Hyperking> are those the same as methods? .appendTo() ..etc
[03:01:46] <Cork> Armistice: keep css in the css
[03:01:50] <Cork> toggle a class instead
[03:03:07] <Armistice> http://jsfiddle.net/hX73v/5/ that's now using classes but still no better... :/
[03:03:09] <Cork> Armistice: also toggle the way you use it isn't supported anymore
[03:03:14] <Armistice> oh
[03:03:15] <Hyperking> Cork: thanks to you( and reading ) I have it working!
[03:03:29] <Armistice> mmm ok.
[03:03:32] <Cork> it was deprecated back in 1.5 or somewhere around there and removed in 1.9
[03:03:52] <Hyperking> cork: 'change' needed to be 'add'
[03:04:23] <Cork> Armistice: http://jsfiddle.net/hX73v/6/
[03:04:55] <Armistice> Cork: but then it lacks the animation... mm
[03:05:25] <Armistice> althoguh should be able to use css for that too.
[03:05:29] <Cork> Armistice: css3 transform ftw :)
[03:05:34] <Cork> ya
[03:10:20] <Hyperking> Cork: would this be the proper way to bind multiple events? .on('add remove')
[03:11:17] <Cork> Hyperking: it is supported in jquery, if the plugin supports it is more then i can answer
[03:14:26] <Hyperking> Cork: it's not, but here is where I try to learn a way to make it work..lol
[03:14:50] <Hyperking> trying to keep the code DRY
[03:15:50] <jop008> How to get on one row a label after that a input field and there after a small button?
[03:16:05] <Cork> Hyperking: then you have to call on twoce
[03:16:10] <Cork> *twice
[03:16:21] <Cork> you might be able to chain then though .on().on()
[03:16:42] <Cork> jop008: just add it after the input?
[03:16:48] <Hyperking> yes, not very clean do you think?
[03:17:03] <jop008> then it is on the next line (button)
[03:17:15] <Cork> Hyperking: if the api doesn't support anything else, then there isn't much you can do
[03:17:26] <Cork> jop008: then you have something set to display: block;
[03:17:36] <jop008> no
[03:17:44] <Cork> heh yes
[03:18:53] <Hyperking> Cork: how would I go about that? I may do a pull request and work on this
[03:21:07] <jop008> I make a fiddle to show you Cork
[03:21:55] <glontu> hi. how can i find a td that has a data-custom="something" ?
[03:22:32] <glontu> doing this: me.selection = $("td[data-quake-id='"+itemId+"']").get(0); isn't working
[03:22:52] <glontu> also is there a problem if my tr elems are added by js after the initial page render ?
[03:23:45] <glontu> pff ... sory ... stupid typo mistake. it works as expected
[03:28:07] <Cork> glontu: $("td[data-quake-id='"+itemId+"']") runs when the parser gets to this line
[03:28:18] <Cork> glontu: as long as the element you want exist then it will find it
[03:28:27] <Cork> if it doesn't exist yet you won't get anything
[03:28:45] <Cork> .get(0) is just another form of [0] so it gives the raw dom element
[03:29:01] <Cork> + of the first element in the array
[03:31:21] <jop008> htis is the code http://jsfiddle.net/fDqZu/181/
[03:32:00] <jop008> dynamicly trying to get label inputfield with a button right next to input field
[03:34:09] <pingec> "table.find('>tbody>tr').height(jGrid.RowHeight)" <- How would I set height of table rows in a more efficient way?
[03:41:16] <jop008> How to get the plus after the input field ? http://jsfiddle.net/fDqZu/183/
[03:43:13] <Biwaa> jop008: you need to set your input field and your plus in inline-block
[03:44:18] <jop008> in a div?
[03:46:22] <jop008> I changed it http://jsfiddle.net/fDqZu/185/
[03:46:32] <jop008> but not in the right way
[03:46:37] <Biwaa> jop008: right now it's displayed with a 100% width, what you need to do is include a smaller width for your plus button
[03:47:43] <jop008> What is better use button or a href?
[03:47:44] <jop008> <button or <a
[03:48:43] <Cork> jop008: if you have a server action, that can happen with js disabled
[03:48:45] <Cork> use a href
[03:48:47] <Cork> else use a button
[03:49:09] <jop008> so whatever
[03:49:19] <jop008> I tried with a width http://jsfiddle.net/fDqZu/186/
[03:49:37] <Biwaa> http://jsfiddle.net/fDqZu/185/
[03:49:53] <jop008> must I give the input a dynamic width like 90%
[03:50:23] <Biwaa> it's better for you if you dont know the with of your user's screen
[03:50:32] <Biwaa> width*
[03:51:27] <jop008> so the input a width of 90% and the button 10%?
[03:51:39] <Biwaa> look my jsfiddle
[03:52:15] <Biwaa> i set a width for the label but not for the button, if you set a width for your button, he will not look likes it is right now
[03:52:31] <jop008> I can get it to looke nice
[03:52:33] <jop008> http://jsfiddle.net/fDqZu/186/
[03:52:37] <jop008> last trial
[03:52:56] <Biwaa> why dont you used my jsfiddle x)
[03:53:06] <Biwaa> http://jsfiddle.net/fDqZu/185/
[03:53:16] <jop008> It is no good
[03:53:32] <jop008> I checked with seamonkey browser
[03:54:06] <jop008> on chrome also the plus is not after the input field
[03:54:39] <jop008> Alll three items must be on one row
[03:54:41] <Biwaa> because your size screen is too small i think
[03:54:52] <jop008> I have 23 inch
[03:55:07] <Biwaa> and your browser in fullscreen ?
[03:55:07] <jop008> must fit :-)
[03:55:11] <jop008> yes
[03:56:32] <jop008> So it is not what I am looking for
[03:56:50] <Biwaa> wait a sec
[03:57:15] <jop008> Not that easy jquery so simple things cost a lot of time
[03:58:21] <seutje> are you trying to style it?
[03:58:26] <Biwaa> yea
[03:58:45] <seutje> heh
[03:58:48] <seutje> http://jsfiddle.net/fDqZu/188/
[03:58:53] <seutje> like that?
[03:58:54] <Cork> jop008: don't mix easy of use for jqm and jq/jqu
[03:59:08] <Cork> cause jqm is a lot worse in that case
[03:59:23] <seutje> it's like saying a rock is hard to cut a tree with
[03:59:40] <seutje> using a saw makes it a lot easier :)
[03:59:51] <seutje> but you could probably do it with the rock though
[04:00:55] <Biwaa> http://jsfiddle.net/fDqZu/185/
[04:01:10] <jop008> still the same
[04:01:16] <seutje> u already pasted that link
[04:01:22] <jop008> + on the next line
[04:01:26] <seutje> jop008: well on small resolutions, it'll still wrap
[04:01:40] <jop008> on 23 inch also
[04:01:42] <seutje> jop008: are u looking at the 188?
[04:01:48] <Biwaa> http://jsfiddle.net/fDqZu/189/
[04:01:56] <Biwaa> yea sry forgot to update
[04:02:21] <seutje> jop008: weird... http://i.imgur.com/WZis6NY.png
[04:02:23] <jop008> that's better but looks ugly not on the same height
[04:02:29] <seutje> not even close to 23inch
[04:02:36] <seutje> well of course
[04:02:55] <Biwaa> well now you have to do some work to do it better ;)
[04:03:11] <jop008> on chrome now fine
[04:03:52] <jop008> safari also
[04:04:10] <jop008> firefox not
[04:04:14] <jop008> on the same line
[04:04:53] <Cork> jop008: is this what your looking for?
[04:04:53] <Cork> <jop008> firefox not
[04:04:53] <Cork> <jop008> on the same line
[04:04:55] <Cork> opps
[04:05:00] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/fDqZu/190/
[04:05:12] <pingec> "table.find('>tbody>tr').height(jGrid.RowHeight)" <- How would I set height of table rows in a more efficient way?
[04:05:15] <jop008> on firefox it is not on the same line
[04:05:28] <jop008> but repaired :-)
[04:05:37] <jop008> so CSS must do the trick
[04:05:40] <fabioportieri> pingec: what's inefficient about it?
[04:05:51] <Cork> jop008: it's on the same line here
[04:06:04] <Cork> jop008: though it will word wrap if the area is too small
[04:06:12] <Cork> jop008: a slightly cleaned up version http://jsfiddle.net/fDqZu/191/
[04:06:34] <fabioportieri> pingec: cache your elements and then set the height wold be more efficient if that statement is executed multiple times upon the same elements
[04:06:35] <jop008> the cleaned up version is broken
[04:06:40] <jop008> on seamonkey
[04:06:42] <seutje> lined up enough? http://jsfiddle.net/fDqZu/192/
[04:06:56] <jop008> also broken
[04:07:08] <pingec> fabioportieri perhaps that it creates a very big array?
[04:07:09] <seutje> can you be any more vague?
[04:07:11] <jop008> this one was best http://jsfiddle.net/fDqZu/190/
[04:07:32] <Cork> seutje: interesting firefox and chrome renders that one completely different
[04:07:43] <seutje> when did this turn into #css anyway?
[04:07:49] <Cork> lol
[04:07:50] <Cork> true
[04:07:52] <fabioportieri> pingec: well if you have a very big rowset.. yes
[04:08:10] <seutje> stop trying to hammer ur tree down
[04:08:15] <seutje> go to the axe-shop
[04:08:50] <fabioportieri> pingec: put a class on your rows would make the elements selection more efficient too
[04:09:41] <pingec> will try thanks
[04:11:44] <seutje> hah, jqm actually comes with an option to put ur buttons inline!
[04:18:13] <jop008> Can I remove #parent ? #parent .ui-input-text, #parent .ui-btn {
[04:18:13] <jop008>     display: inline-block;
[04:18:14] <jop008>     vertical-align: middle;
[04:18:15] <jop008> }
[04:18:33] <jop008> since all buttons must be inline-block
[04:20:45] <fabioportieri> jop008: if you inted to put that rule for every .ui-stuff, then yes
[04:21:15] <jop008> but removing parent breaks it
[04:21:24] <jop008> http://jsfiddle.net/fDqZu/198/
[04:32:39] <fabioportieri> jop008: what?
[04:33:07] <jop008> I try to use it also with an icon button http://jsfiddle.net/fDqZu/205/
[04:33:09] <Cork> jop008: trailing comma in the selector
[04:33:19] <jop008> I saw and fixed that
[04:33:41] <jop008> I want to have hello next to the input field like the +
[04:34:45] <Cork> jop008: the width of the display: inline-block is causing that
[04:35:45] <jop008> which element you refer to?
[04:35:51] <jop008> the input field?
[04:35:58] <jop008> the button width?
[04:36:08] <Cork> <div style="display: inline-block;">
[04:36:43] <Cork> as the fields is percent of that element
[04:36:51] <Cork> you get overflow cause the button has a min width
[04:37:00] <Cork> if you set something like <div style="display: inline-block;min-width: 428px;"> it works
[04:37:01] <jop008> so remove there teh display inline block?
[04:37:30] <jop008> not a good move
[04:38:18] <Cork> no, the problem is the width
[04:38:21] <aforavi> hello, where can I get the server log of this channel ?
[04:38:26] <Cork> not specifically the display value
[04:38:37] <Cork> aforavi: don't think there is one anymore
[04:38:49] <Cork> there used to be one but it wasn't updated last i checked
[04:39:11] <aforavi> Cork: got it, its here http://irc.jquery.org/%23jquery/
[04:39:40] <Cork> ah, so it's live again
[04:40:13] <aforavi> this is what I'm looking for http://irc.jquery.org/%23jquery/default_%23jquery_20140307.log.html
[04:40:18] <Cork> (always irks me out when a channel is publicly logged)
[04:40:27] <aforavi> it really saved my time
[04:44:10] <aforavi> Cork: got a moment for quick IM?
[04:44:16] <aforavi> oops
[04:44:18] <aforavi> PM*
[04:44:21] <aforavi> ?
[04:44:44] <Mothership> hello
[04:44:49] <Cork> aforavi: not really no
[04:45:03] <aforavi> Cork: oww ... it's ok! :D
[04:45:25] <aforavi> so, here is the problem I'm dealing with http://jsfiddle.net/NrmTW/4/
[04:45:41] <Mothership> http://pastie.org/8903222 - any idea why would the callback is not excecuting, even though server responds with 200? :/
[04:45:59] <Mothership> not excecute*
[04:46:29] <Cork> Mothership: check the .fail() callback
[04:49:04] <ankurk_> Well I have quite a long list of options in a select box, http://jsbin.com/soxecixo/2/edit. What I want to do when user selects 0 & 1 from first select the 2 select should show options with value 2 to 62 & when he selects 2, second select should list options with value 2 & 4 only. At last when he selects 3, it should list option with value 1 only. What can
[04:49:04] <ankurk_> be a most efficient way to this?
[04:49:25] <aforavi> Cork: In generally, ajax errors are defaultly handled by ajaxSetup() .. but when I press "Fetch Model" button It seems like the default error handling is bypassed ? can I have a solution for this ?
[04:49:59] <Cork> aforavi: backbone most likely isn't using $.ajax
[04:50:05] <Cork> so ajaxSetup has not effect on it
[04:50:05] <aforavi> ok
[04:50:34] <ankurk_> It should be a simple show & hide right
[04:51:04] <xKraty> gosh ankurk_ again!
[04:51:10] <Cork> ankurk_: it should, but it isn't
[04:51:11] <ankurk_> yeah :P
[04:51:12] <aforavi> how can I make it work, I mean I want the default error handling function to be called even in backbone
[04:51:14] <xKraty> sup?
[04:51:22] <Cork> only geckoo let you fiddle with the options in a select box
[04:51:27] <aforavi> Cork: is there a way to do this?
[04:51:32] <Cork> display: none; breaks the other engines badly
[04:51:41] <ankurk_> Cork: so what should I do in that case?
[04:51:51] <ankurk_> xKraty: I am fine man, you tell?
[04:51:57] <xKraty> im cool
[04:52:00] <xKraty> just stressed from work
[04:52:01] <Cork> ankurk_: you would have to move (detatch) the options from the select element
[04:52:07] <Cork> and add them back when you want them visible
[04:52:11] <Cork> no other option sadly
[04:52:21] <ankurk_> detach?
[04:52:23] <ankurk_> hmm
[04:52:26] <Cork> ?api detatch
[04:52:26] <b-ot> Cork: No matches.
[04:52:32] <Cork> ?api detach
[04:52:33] <b-ot> Cork: .detach(): Remove the set of matched elements from the DOM. http://api.jquery.com/detach/
[04:53:37] <ankurk_> xKraty: Same here as well :P
[04:55:58] <xKraty> ankurk_: i'm looking into your fiddle
[04:56:21] <ankurk_> detach seems to be the only option for me I guess
[04:56:34] <Cork> ya
[04:57:02] <Cork> ankurk_: if you set display: none; then chrome and ie still renders the space for the element
[04:57:14] <Cork> as if you set visibility: hidden; instead of display: none;
[04:57:33] <ankurk_> yeah, I actually had issues with .show() & .hide()
[04:58:11] <Mothership> Thanks Cork! The error message is: parseerror
[04:58:14] <Cork> it sucks kinda hard, but... not much you can do
[04:58:24] <Cork> Mothership: suspected it :)
[04:58:45] <Mothership> Cork, if i post json, does it expect to get json back?
[04:59:02] <Cork> Mothership: you normally can't post json
[04:59:30] <Cork> but what jquery expects depends on the content-type the server sends
[04:59:45] <Cork> dataType sets what jquery will ASK the server for
[04:59:58] <Cork> what the server sends is up to the server
[05:03:43] <jop008> is there a tool where html is translated into jquery inline js code?
[05:04:21] <jop008> I want to recreate this fiddle to inline js code
[05:04:25] <SprkDev> How do I ajaxify my login form? http://pastebin.com/VS36b1DM
[05:04:25] <jop008> http://jsfiddle.net/fDqZu/189/
[05:07:54] <velus> hello i have some little problem, i am trying to use this code my mate gave me which is this http://codepad.viper-7.com/tqCmdg , i need this to be able to get a json reponse and if the response is {'sucess':'yes} then reload the page if the response is 'fail':'your passowrd/username was rong' it shows up the boxes in red? how do i do this
[05:10:33] <ankurk_> xKraty: I forgot to tell that 2nd select box elements are generated dynamically
[05:12:36] <seutje> velus: something like this? http://codepad.viper-7.com/hCOKWD
[05:12:48] <seutje> tbh, the server should probably return an error with a message
[05:13:22] <seutje> crap, '.form' should be '.login'
[05:14:23] <velus> ok im alittle confussed now
[05:16:04] <jop008> how to get the default theme with code?
[05:16:28] <Cork> what do you mean by default theme?
[05:17:30] <velus> and the error message is from the api system i.e the form sends data to a page named login.php the values in post will be snet to a class in php that procesess the login and iff the usenrame and pass is correct it sends and array back and that will be put in to the sessions if it comes back faild it will send back a message saying errror your username or passowrd was wrong. i have in php a little if clause if (is_array){ do the settings and send back in
[05:17:30] <velus> json sucess = yes } else { send back in json faild = the error message
[05:18:27] <seutje> velus: I'm talking about the response code
[05:18:38] <velus> http://codepad.viper-7.com/BVTZGV that has the api login.php
[05:19:50] <seutje> most things don't respond with "200 - OK" on a failed login
[05:20:18] <jop008> the current theme I want to no
[05:20:24] <jop008> in JS
[05:20:31] <jop008> know
[05:21:02] <velus> this is custom responces, it needs to process the data before it sends a ok to the system,
[05:22:50] <seutje> jop008: ur fiddle is just using the default: http://code.jquery.com/mobile/1.3.2/jquery.mobile-1.3.2.min.css
[05:23:37] <jop008> I wnat to create elements in the tree
[05:23:45] <seutje> go for it
[05:23:48] <jop008> and give these elemnets the correct theme
[05:23:56] <seutje> http://demos.jquerymobile.com/1.2.0/docs/api/themes.html
[05:24:14] <jop008> I must supply data-theme="c" or anohter current theme
[05:25:41] <seutje> sry, these docs seem more up to date: http://api.jquerymobile.com/theme/
[05:27:38] <velus> seutje: so will this now work? so when the jquery sends the data it gets back custom resposes. and listens for the json back
[05:27:41] <velus> http://codepad.viper-7.com/Zi9hpg
[05:28:32] <seutje> velus: well, no
[05:28:37] <seutje> you're return "yes"
[05:29:33] <velus> so the sucess would have to return 200 - OK
[05:29:35] <velus> ??
[05:29:41] <seutje> why do ppl feel the need to put some weird abstraction layer on something as simple as a boolean?
[05:30:05] <velus> so what would i have it return on a sucess
[05:30:28] <seutje> boolean preferably
[05:30:36] <velus> so true
[05:31:34] <velus> and would  $('.login').addClass('error'); work or would it be  $('.form.login').addClass('error');
[05:34:04] <slax0r> velus: it will work, but the first will attach class error to every element which has class login, but the second will attach to every element which has form and login classes at the same time
[05:34:37] <hellothere> hey anyone knows any html to markdown plugins ? need to convert from tinymce to markdown
[05:37:38] <seutje> velus: it won't the 'form' is an element, not a class, so 'form.login'
[05:37:43] <seutje> not '.form.login'
[05:37:57] <seutje> that would imply <element class="form login">
[05:38:16] <Mothership> Cork, thanks! used $.ajax instead of $.post and set the dataType to the one that server responds with and everything works now
[05:38:20] <seutje> Cork: heh, just ran into another weird FF-only issue
[05:38:34] <seutje> seems to be mainly stuff relating to relative positioning
[05:38:58] <Cork> seutje: not sure what end had the bug with the other one, didn't dig into it
[05:39:14] <seutje> me neither, but I'm getting a lot of those lately
[05:39:25] <seutje> maybe somebody should :P
[05:39:40] <Cork> seutje: by experience gecko is normally more complient when it comes to these things
[05:39:56] <Cork> (though i miss presto as it was a maniac when it came to standards)
[05:40:46] <seutje> Cork: I'm not saying FF is at fault, just sad that we still have to deal with this shit
[05:41:01] <Cork> ya
[05:41:21] <seutje> nobody is surprised when IE goes all quirky, ppl almost expect iOS safari to be a douche, but most other desktop browsers have settled
[05:42:10] <Cork> well they try to cut so many corners now days that bugs creep up all over the place
[05:42:17] <Cork> (svg animateions is broken in ff...)
[05:42:38] <seutje> oh man, I'm staying clear of SVG for the coming year at least
[05:43:02] <Cork> well we don't have a single pixmap on this site
[05:43:06] <Cork> cause it need to scale well
[05:43:12] <Cork> so svg is really the only option
[05:43:27] <seutje> oh, nah, I meant drawing at runtime
[05:43:35] <seutje> assets, sure
[05:44:00] <Cork> seutje: https://bug935888.bugzilla.mozilla.org/attachment.cgi?id=828542
[05:44:59] <seutje> ah boo
[05:45:01] <Sardo> hello everyone, can someone help out in this? http://jsfiddle.net/h3WDq/ I need to add a hashtag to the url once the modal open
[05:45:15] <seutje> Cork: ever tried drawing stuff manually?
[05:45:23] <bibor> hi
[05:45:23] <Cork> seutje: sure
[05:45:36] <seutje> how was the plethora of inconsistencies? :D
[05:45:46] <bibor> $("#id .class") works but not $("#id").children(".class")?
[05:46:03] <Cork> seutje: it has actually worked well for me
[05:46:16] <Cork> seutje: though i have reported a long list of bugs for the implementation
[05:46:28] <seutje> Cork: I remember a world of pain when it came to patterns and gradients
[05:46:29] <Cork> i started testing it before it even landed in ff nightly :)
[05:46:41] <seutje> mostly in webkit though
[05:46:53] <Cork> ya
[05:46:55] <Cork> oh ya
[05:47:00] <Cork> i've seen plenty of those
[05:47:09] <seutje> Sardo: this bootstrap?
[05:47:17] <seutje> oh wait, I can check external resources lol
[05:47:25] <Sardo> seutje: yes
[05:47:37] <Cork> seutje: the funny part is when users file bugs to other browsers complaining they render the svg wrong :)
[05:47:52] <Cork> (no, what you see in chrome is a bug...) XD
[05:48:35] <petzup> http://pastebin.com/f0ef6cQq why i dont get id from a tag?
[05:48:43] <Cork> but using css gradients instead helped for most of those things
[05:48:47] <seutje> Sardo: http://jsfiddle.net/h3WDq/25/
[05:49:07] <slax0r> petzup: #action is the id
[05:49:08] <seutje> Cork: yeah, fell back to that for some things
[05:49:14] <Cork> PeterBooker: you don't have an element with that id
[05:49:15] <seutje> but the patterns were just a mess
[05:49:15] <petzup> hm
[05:49:21] <Cork> opps
[05:49:23] <petzup> how should i fix it?
[05:49:23] <Cork> *petzup:
[05:49:34] <Cork> Peterman: .action not #action
[05:49:34] <slax0r> that statement is like, searching for a guy named Peter and when you find him you ask him what his name is
[05:49:37] <seutje> in chrome, if you clone an element with a patterns, then remove it, the original element will have its pattern turn black
[05:49:42] <Cork> <ul class="dropdown-menu action"> <--
[05:49:44] <seutje> shit like that
[05:50:08] <slax0r> $(this).attr("id") would make more sense in there
[05:50:19] <Cork> man there is way to many pet* n here...
[05:50:32] <seutje> Sardo: if u want it after it opened, change show to shown (I think)
[05:51:00] <petzup> still nothing
[05:51:13] <Cork> petzup: what element is it you want to target?
[05:51:30] <seutje> Sardo: like this http://jsfiddle.net/h3WDq/26/
[05:51:34] <petzup>    <li><a id="delete">Delete</a></li>         <li><a id="generate">Generate</a></li>
[05:51:38] <petzup> this are elements
[05:51:53] <petzup> when i click delete i want to get throught post delete
[05:51:57] <Cork> so you want to target the currently clicked element?
[05:52:01] <petzup> yes
[05:52:15] <Cork> then $(this).attr('id') should work
[05:52:25] <Cork> though you prob shouldn't use <a> tags for this
[05:52:41] <seutje> Sardo: le docs: http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#modals-usage (scroll down to events)
[05:52:43] <Cork> (you don't have any href on them so no point in having a tags)
[05:52:56] <petzup> okey
[05:53:05] <petzup> so just <li id="a">a</li>
[05:53:18] <Cork> ya
[05:54:31] <petzup> still nothing
[05:54:46] <petzup> how can i get this i alert() so i would see if it goes throught
[05:55:16] <Cork> use console.log not alert
[05:55:37] <Cork> alert affects the event loop, so it can mess things up for you
[05:55:56] <petzup> console.log($(this).attr('id')) ?
[05:56:29] <petzup> okey
[05:56:31] <petzup> i get undefinded
[05:57:27] <velus> ok thanks seutje sorry for long reply but i was cooking some sothern fried chicked
[05:57:44] <seutje> sounds like a legit excuse
[05:58:10] <petzup> $(this).attr('id'); 		$('#form').submit(); this works now i get in log but why it doesnt go in post?
[05:59:34] <velus> yeah specially when you hand coat it and then deep fry it in a special oil
[05:59:55] <petzup> $('#action').val($(this).html()); this works but i dont want to get value of li i want  to get id
[06:08:12] <nullfrog> Hey, how should I go about detecting which element is "closest" to where the user has scrolled? When an event triggers I'd want to scroll to the next container on the page, but how do I keep track of what is currently in the view?
[06:09:29] <nullfrog> I was thinking of looping through them every time and comparing their offset to window's scrolltop to detect the nearest, but is there any better way to do it?
[06:10:19] <jop008> is this correct code ? var ohrefbutton = $('<a>',{ "data-role":"button", title:"" , class:"ui-btn ui-btn-up-c ui-shadow ui-btn-corner-all ui-btn-icon-notext" })
[06:10:47] <jop008> the line after this I have unexpected identifier
[06:12:04] <Cork> nullfrog: you would have to check the position() of the element
[06:12:38] <Cork> jop008: class: => "class":
[06:12:55] <Cork> hmm no that shouldn't matter
[06:13:25] <jop008> okay
[06:15:15] <Cork> jop008: the error is most likely from earlier in the code
[06:20:54] <DRSK> How do I add to a selection? var content = $('.content' ) and now I'd like to do $( content + '.active' );
[06:21:15] <jop008> Take a look at this pleasehttp://jsfiddle.net/RhWgf/468/
[06:21:24] <jop008> it throws an error but why?
[06:22:39] <Cork> DRSK: .filter('.active')
[06:23:06] <DRSK> ah thanks
[06:23:33] <petzup> soo
[06:23:39] <petzup> what is soltion for me?
[06:24:44] <Cork> petzup: could you paste the html and code related to the question?
[06:25:06] <petzup> http://pastebin.com/f0ef6cQq
[06:25:11] <petzup> i want to get id not value
[06:25:40] <Cork> petzup: there is no element with the id action
[06:26:10] <petzup> upc
[06:26:12] <petzup> sory old code
[06:26:13] <petzup> sec
[06:26:50] <petzup> http://pastebin.com/Ne733vHt
[06:27:09] <petzup> when i select one i want to submit form and get clicked data to post
[06:27:30] <petzup> $('#action').val($(this).html()); this works, but its not ok because it gets value
[06:28:50] <Cork> petzup: $('#action').val($(this).attr('id')) should work just fine
[06:29:03] <Cork> petzup: also you can remove the <a> tag it isn't needed
[06:29:19] <petzup> need it becase it fucks my style..
[06:29:31] <Cork> then style the li element
[06:30:00] <petzup> yes worxs
[06:32:37] <krambiorix> hi, i when trying  $(this).closest('table').find('tr')[z].find('input').val('0,00');  -> i get $(...).closest(...).find(...)[z].find is not a function  .... Can't i do [z] where z is 1, 2, 3 ....?
[06:33:07] <Cork> krambiorix: find('tr')[z] gives you the raw dom element
[06:33:14] <Cork> so you can't use jquery after that
[06:33:19] <Cork> you prob want .eq()
[06:34:22] <Cork> so $(this).closest('table').find('tr').eq(z).find('input').val('0,00');
[06:35:25] <Cork> krambiorix: though i would prob set a class on the input field instead
[06:35:36] <Cork> that way you can write a simpler selector
[06:36:27] <krambiorix> Cork, yes good idea, thanks!
[06:45:00] <zagaza> does anyone know where I could find the source code for a game similar to this? a 2d arrow/something shooter in a bow game.. http://www.html5games.ca/shooting/archery/
[06:56:01] <jop008> I have this   var input = $('<input type="text">').attr({id: this.fieldname + "_field", placeholder: this.placeholder,
[06:56:02] <jop008>                  class: "ui-input-text ui-body-c ui-autocomplete-input", autocomplete:"on" });
[06:56:17] <jop008> how to give input more width it is now a small input field
[06:58:12] <jop008> it looks like the parent div with display inline shortens the width
[06:59:13] <BillCriswell> jop008: You would use css width on the input.
[06:59:35] <jop008> I tried it with 80%
[07:00:17] <BillCriswell> That would mean 80% of its container, which is inline.
[07:01:19] <seutje> if you have just that, the input wouldn't have any width, as it isn't in the DOM, so it won't be rendered
[07:01:30] <jop008> and what is inline meaning?
[07:01:55] <seutje> if it is in the DOM, its rendering will depend heavily on the context
[07:02:01] <jop008> why are things smaller when inbedded in a div inline?
[07:02:21] <seutje> that would be the "C" part in "CSS"
[07:02:39] <jop008> Target solution is an input with a button right to it
[07:02:47] <jop008> created by javascript only
[07:03:15] <leknoppix> hello
[07:04:46] <leknoppix> i have a problem, when I clone an input with an autocomplete element, i can't use autocomplete on this new input
[07:04:54] <leknoppix> you can help me please
[07:07:43] <leknoppix> i don't understand because in jquery documentation, the function with true attribute permite to keep different action
[07:07:45] <Cork> leknoppix: you need to run he plugin on it again
[07:07:57] <Cork> a clone is a clone so it doesn't have the code attached to it
[07:08:07] <seutje> jop008: it can be created by C++ for all the browser cares, it only checks if it is in the DOM, if it needs to be rendered and in what displaying context it needs to be redered
[07:09:04] <jop008> So how to enlarge an input field?
[07:09:09] <jop008> not using C++
[07:09:20] <leknoppix> thank cork, i'm trying this, i be back here if it don't use
[07:09:52] <seutje> jop008: increase the explicit width or increase the width on the rendering context (usually the parent element)
[07:10:50] <jop008> okay
[07:11:04] <fabioportieri> jop008: it isn't difficult
[07:11:20] <anli_> I have an example where .change is not occuring on a textbox, what is wrong with this? http://jsfiddle.net/j938v/
[07:11:22] <jop008> as you know the solution
[07:11:32] <seutje> it's pretty difficult to determine without any context
[07:11:34] <anli_> Writing text in the box will not uncheck the box
[07:11:44] <anli_> (will not uncheck the checkbox)
[07:11:48] <seutje> for all I know, there's a rule saying * { width: 50% !important; }
[07:12:06] <seutje> then u can do a lot before the width of ur input field actually changes
[07:12:09] <leknoppix> Cork, he don't run, look my pastin: http://pastebin.com/NjkvbRym
[07:13:02] <Cork> leknoppix: why are you calling .end() all over the place?
[07:13:13] <timmi_qt> I use jquery datatables plugin and the table works well. Currently it gets stretched to the page width. Do you know if its possible to let it collapse to minimum needed width or is that impossible?
[07:13:28] <BillCriswell> anli_: This appears to be working for me.
[07:13:40] <Cork> leknoppix: also what is clonage?
[07:13:47] <anli_> So if you write text in the textbox, the checkbox will uncheck?
[07:13:52] <jop008> I can do it with min-width: 500px; on the input element
[07:14:20] <BillCriswell> anli_: A change wouldn't happen till you blur the input, maybe you want like keyup?
[07:14:23] <anli_> I dont even enter the change handler, for some reason
[07:14:33] <leknoppix> clonage is an jquery plugin https://github.com/johnulist/jquery.cake.clone
[07:14:37] <Cork> anli_, BillCriswell: input not keyup
[07:14:37] <anli_> Hm, must maybe do that
[07:14:57] <BillCriswell> "must maybe"
[07:15:20] <anli_> Maybe I have to do that
[07:15:22] <BillCriswell> Cork: $('.foo').on('input') ?
[07:15:24] <Cork> yes
[07:15:27] <Cork> anli_: http://jsfiddle.net/j938v/1/
[07:15:30] <BillCriswell> Never used that one.
[07:15:45] <Cork> BillCriswell: it is like keydown but with the updated field
[07:15:49] <Cork> so it isn't buggy like keyup is
[07:15:56] <anli_> What is on("input" using?
[07:16:08] <Cork> ?mdn input event
[07:16:10] <b-ot> Cork: input - Web technology reference | MDN - Mozilla Developer Network → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Reference/Events/input
[07:16:18] <anli_> Is it a complicated handler made out of hacks?
[07:16:25] <Cork> no
[07:16:29] <BillCriswell> Nope, seems pretty standard.
[07:16:29] <Cork> it is native dom event
[07:16:35] <BillCriswell> Not sure how I never came across that.
[07:16:36] <Cork> and cross browser
[07:16:40] <anli_> nice
[07:16:42] <anli_> thanks :)
[07:16:57] <anli_> There is no non-.on form of it?
[07:16:59] <anli_> lol
[07:17:10] <pingec> Is it possible to retrieve a css rule without having a DOM elemnt that matches its selector?
[07:17:30] <BinaryKitten> yes
[07:17:30] <Cork> pingec: that wold be the rule
[07:17:42] <Cork> pingec: if you work from the element you arn't accessing the rule
[07:17:52] <Cork> document.styleSheets
[07:17:57] <Cork> ?mdn document.styleSheets
[07:17:59] <b-ot> Cork: document.styleSheets - Web API Interfaces - Mozilla Developer ... → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/document.styleSheets
[07:18:09] <BinaryKitten> that's the one
[07:18:09] <BillCriswell> anli_: Doesn't look like it.
[07:18:15] <anli_> ah
[07:18:30] <Cork> anli_: you mean short hand?
[07:18:36] <pingec> So... how would I get the "background-color" for "input[readonly]" css rule?
[07:18:40] <BinaryKitten> pingec i use document.styleSheets to iterate through them to do image autoloading
[07:18:42] <Cork> no manu events don't have short hands
[07:18:43] <anli_> Like .click(function(){});
[07:18:49] <Cork> anli_: though you can add it if you like
[07:18:52] <pingec> hmm
[07:19:06] <BinaryKitten> pingec you have to iterate through them
[07:19:09] <anli_> Isn't .on like .live that it allows for listening to future elements?
[07:19:15] <Cork> no
[07:19:23] <anli_> So there is no .live replacement?
[07:19:29] <Cork> no
[07:19:33] <anli_> Wow, thanks God
[07:19:34] <pingec> ok will try iterating them
[07:19:36] <BinaryKitten> pingec https://github.com/BinaryKitten/jQuery-Preloader/blob/master/jquery.preloader.js for my plugin on how to loop through
[07:19:37] <pingec> thanks
[07:19:43] <Cork> on is a combination function that does .bind and .delegate
[07:19:45] <anli_> .live was so awful
[07:19:49] <Cork> ya
[07:19:56] <Cork> that is why it was deprecated
[07:19:57] <leknoppix> .live is not deprecate ?
[07:20:03] <anli_> _was_
[07:20:04] <Cork> it is
[07:20:04] <anli_> lol
[07:20:05] <Cork> and removed
[07:20:12] <BinaryKitten> pingec https://github.com/BinaryKitten/jQuery-Preloader/blob/master/jquery.preloader.js#L99 for closer link
[07:20:13] <Cork> 1.9+ doesn't support it
[07:20:17] <leknoppix> remove at jquery 1.7
[07:20:20] <Cork> no
[07:20:21] <anli_> I never supported it
[07:20:28] <Cork> it was deprecated in 1.7
[07:20:49] <Cork> anli_: .delegate was a replacement implementation for .live
[07:20:55] <Cork> and it has a sane syntax
[07:21:05] <anli_> So .on will work like .live then?
[07:21:07] <leknoppix> Cork, at the question, what is clonage function,  clonage is an jquery plugin https://github.com/johnulist/jquery.cake.clone
[07:21:12] <BinaryKitten> anli_ no
[07:21:17] <BinaryKitten> .on works like .delegate
[07:21:23] <Cork> anli_: again, no, it will work like .delegate if you give it delegate argument syntax
[07:21:24] <BinaryKitten> and like .bind
[07:21:25] <anli_> "on is a combination function that does .bind and .delegate"
[07:21:41] <BinaryKitten> exactly
[07:21:46] <Cork> anli_: delegate can do the same thing as delegate
[07:21:51] <Cork> but delegate isn't live
[07:21:53] <anli_> That is not working like delegate, that is using delegate
[07:21:55] <Cork> it can do the same thing though
[07:22:08] <BinaryKitten> no, it doesn't use delegate
[07:22:12] <Cork> anli_: delegate was converted to a shim in 1.9
[07:22:13] <anli_> ah, ok
[07:22:20] <BinaryKitten> :D
[07:22:22] <Cork> so delegate is just a tiny function now days
[07:22:22] <anli_> :)
[07:22:29] <Cork> (one liner)
[07:22:33] <anli_> cool
[07:22:39] <anli_> Makes it easier to remove it
[07:22:40] <anli_> lol
[07:22:52] <Cork> delegate: function( selector, types, data, fn ) { return this.on( types, selector, data, fn ); },
[07:22:59] <Cork> that is all the code inside delegate
[07:23:07] <BinaryKitten> :D
[07:23:13] <anli_> It switches two fucking args :)
[07:23:15] <BinaryKitten> pretty function is pretty
[07:23:19] <Cork> yup :)
[07:23:24] <BinaryKitten> language Angli
[07:23:28] <anli_> oh
[07:23:44] <BinaryKitten> two fn arguments anli_ :p
[07:23:51] <Cork> anli_: .bind(event, fn) => .on(event, fn)
[07:23:54] <anli_> heh, we all know what "fn" means
[07:24:02] <BinaryKitten> function
[07:24:08] <BinaryKitten> ;)
[07:24:08] <anli_> Did mean that, until now
[07:24:11] <anli_> ;)
[07:24:13] <Cork> anli_: .delegate(target, event, fn) => .on(event, target, fn)
[07:24:25] <anli_> yeah
[07:24:35] <anli_> I already concluded that from what you wrot
[07:24:36] <anli_> wrote
[07:24:39] <Cork> so if the second argument isn't a selector you have a bind call
[07:24:52] <BinaryKitten> and they were only kept in so not to break lots of people's plugins
[07:24:59] <Cork> anli_: i meant what differs .bind from .delegate
[07:25:04] <anli_> yeah
[07:25:07] <Cork> cause bind is the same thing
[07:25:15] <anli_> What is the diff between .bind and .on then?
[07:25:20] <Cork> bind: function( types, data, fn ) { return this.on( types, null, data, fn ); },
[07:25:22] <BinaryKitten> anli_ nothing
[07:25:24] <anli_> oh
[07:25:25] <Cork> on can do bind and delegate
[07:25:36] <Cork> bind is only bind
[07:25:41] <anli_> I am only me
[07:25:45] <Cork> :)
[07:26:27] <Cork> same for off => unbind and undelegate btw
[07:27:28] <anli_> Btw, is there a minimal jquery implementation with only the most important stuff?
[07:27:46] <Cork> no
[07:27:47] <anli_> Or I write one
[07:27:58] <anli_> Just for fun
[07:27:59] <Cork> i've seen an alternative implementation though
[07:28:03] <anli_> ok
[07:28:32] <Cork> anli_: http://zeptojs.com/
[07:28:54] <decx> browsersupport is a dealbreaker for zepto
[07:29:04] <anli_> oh, it doesnt do it well?
[07:29:06] <decx> unless your site only targets cutting edge
[07:29:25] <anli_> I think jquery is breaking on browser support as well, doesnt it? Does it have full ie7 support?
[07:29:29] <Cork> anli_: most of the code in jquery is to help handle broken browsers
[07:29:34] <anli_> yeah
[07:29:42] <Cork> anli_: it does and it doesn't
[07:29:48] <Cork> jquery has two versions
[07:29:49] <anli_> So it does not :)
[07:29:51] <anli_> ah
[07:29:59] <anli_> There is a uncut version then?
[07:30:00] <Cork> and there are other browser bugs then just ie
[07:30:01] <anli_> an
[07:30:06] <Cork> 1.11
[07:30:10] <anli_> Cool
[07:30:14] <Cork> 1.x has legacy support
[07:30:20] <anli_> I never knew
[07:30:24] <Cork> 2.x is the same version but without old ie support
[07:30:28] <anli_> Has it thrown away .live?
[07:30:37] <anli_> ah, sorry, it has
[07:30:38] <Cork> like i said, same version
[07:30:38] <anli_> since 1.9
[07:30:54] <Cork> 2.1 === 1.11 - < ie7 support
[07:31:04] <Cork> opps <= ie7 support
[07:31:21] <Cork> hmm no i think it dropped ie8 too
[07:31:46] <Cork> ya
[07:31:49] <Cork> 2.x is ie9+
[07:40:36] <jop008> I have data=icon edit but it is displayed as a plus
[07:42:59] <anli_> Do you have an .edit class?
[07:43:19] <anli_> Well, the class name will not be .edit, but edit
[07:44:26] <anli_> I used data-icon="feedback" and added .km-feedback:after .km-feedback:before { content: "\e0fa"; } (kendo ui)
[07:44:50] <anli_> That shows as an exclamation mark inside a ring if the font is kendo ui
[07:49:54] <leknoppix> Cork, you don't see my error?
[07:50:33] <Cork> leknoppix: why do you need a plugin for that?
[07:50:39] <Cork> what's wrong with .clone() ?
[07:51:32] <seutje> should probably use data-icon="edit" instead
[07:51:57] <jop008> I downloaded this http://andymatthews.net/code/jQuery-Mobile-Icon-Pack/ but still no edit icon
[07:52:10] <leknoppix> with clone, i can clone autocomplete instruction  same if il re-init autocomplete
[07:52:59] <jop008> hwat ever icon I use always only the plus icon is shown
[07:55:00] <jop008> any reason why only data icon plus is displayed?
[07:56:28] <fabioportieri> jop008: you should learn use dev tools, when you inspect an element it shows the styles associated to it, it's easy to find out bugs with it
[07:56:58] <jop008> thx
[07:57:53] <jop008> inpect element I have data-icon= bars
[07:58:15] <BinaryKitten> with or whout quotes?
[07:58:36] <BinaryKitten> also
[07:58:46] <BinaryKitten> which ui framework are you using?
[07:58:53] <seutje> don't try to get any actual code examples out of him
[07:58:53] <seutje> I've been trying for like 5 hours now
[07:59:02] <seutje> mobile
[07:59:08] <seutje> figured out that much
[07:59:46] <BinaryKitten> seutje heh
[07:59:58] <seutje> jop008: this icon pack looks offset on my chromesie
[08:01:22] <seutje> jop008: http://jsfiddle.net/fDqZu/215/ BAM! bars
[08:01:25] <DRSK> Cork » http://jsfiddle.net/4jzQP/ <-- care to take a look and give any tips on how I could do that better?
[08:01:29] <DRSK> or seutje :D
[08:02:41] <BinaryKitten> seutje i added quotes to your <a> tag http://jsfiddle.net/fDqZu/216/
[08:02:45] <seutje> hate it when ppl don't bracket their if clauses
[08:02:55] <BinaryKitten> seutje ditto
[08:03:00] <seutje> BinaryKitten: oh, I only changed it from plus to bars
[08:03:09] <BinaryKitten> heh
[08:03:11] <DRSK> wops, sorry. my fast testing does that :/
[08:03:51] <seutje> otherwise I would have wrapped it in an IIFE, turned off jsfiddle onload option, gotten rid of the ID and perhaps turned the useless link into a button :P
[08:04:09] <BinaryKitten> ^5 seutje
[08:04:10] <BinaryKitten> :D
[08:04:14] <DRSK> what's iife?

[08:04:26] <jop008> I create the elements by javascript
[08:04:35] <seutje> some ppl like to call it a closure
[08:07:11] <jop008> like this http://jsfiddle.net/fDqZu/217/
[08:07:19] <Cork> seutje: don't forget "scope" :)
[08:07:23] <BinaryKitten> heh iife = closure that's immediately executed
[08:08:47] <seutje> I just like the sound of "iffy"
[08:08:49] <seutje> :P
[08:09:07] <seutje> jop008: ur not initializing it as a jquery ui button widget though
[08:09:20] <seutje> if u just wanna recreate the markup, inspect the rendered UI button
[08:09:29] <jop008> how to init?
[08:09:32] <BinaryKitten> also, jop008 you're creating globals
[08:09:43] <DRSK> well I was more asking how to do the actual functionality different, I'm not too convinced using a negative top value and animating it to a positive one is the way to go, but it "kinda" works.
[08:09:56] <jop008> example code only
[08:10:04] <jop008> how to init the button?
[08:10:06] <BinaryKitten> bad examples = bad
[08:10:28] <seutje> jop008: http://jsfiddle.net/fDqZu/218/
[08:10:32] <seutje> just call .button() on it
[08:10:50] <jop008> Many thanks
[08:11:02] <DRSK> BinaryKitten » I agree, but for me to make it into a good example I'd love some more feedback other than "IIFE plx" :)) I almost understood what it meant after reading about it.
[08:11:34] <BinaryKitten> DRSK sorry crossed lines here
[08:11:47] <BinaryKitten> was referrring to jop008
[08:11:55] <DRSK> wops, sorry ;p
[08:11:58] <BinaryKitten> not seen your code DRSK
[08:12:07] <bongjovi> Can I return a string using a function with .css, like $elem.css(func()); ?
[08:12:08] <BinaryKitten> now that you raise it,
[08:12:23] <DRSK> well, it's more of a dump of what I was fiddeling with and I felt like I was doing it the wrong way so I figured I'd ask ;p
[08:12:32] <seutje> DRSK: try to avoid repeating selectors
[08:12:40] <BinaryKitten> DRSK you already have an iife
[08:12:43] <seutje> if the result couldn't have changed, cache it the first time
[08:12:49] <BillCriswell> bongjovi: I don't believe so. Did you try it?
[08:13:00] <seutje> DRSK: like $('.welcome')
[08:13:02] <DRSK> BinaryKitten » well around the entire thing I guess, yeah ;p
[08:13:02] <BinaryKitten> DRSK lines 1 and 35 = iiife
[08:13:18] <seutje> iiiiiiiiiife!
[08:13:29] <bongjovi> Sure did, no luck.
[08:13:29] <DRSK> seutje » sorry, that was left there from some testing, not meant to be there later on. Basically my question is something like "can I make the functionality of animating the top value differently"?
[08:13:33] <seutje> sry, made me chuckle :P
[08:13:43] <seutje> DRSK: ooooh
[08:13:48] <BillCriswell> bongjovi: The only thing I can think of adding a <style> with the string in there.
[08:14:00] <BinaryKitten> DRSK i like the yoda-ism
[08:14:05] <DRSK> as in, can I do "contentSlide()" niftier? better? more .. robust? animating .. well, yes :p
[08:14:07] <DRSK> haha
[08:14:28] <BillCriswell> bongjovi: Wait, duh. How about .attr('style', getStyles())
[08:14:33] <BinaryKitten> yoda-isms are great for code validation
[08:14:43] <seutje> DRSK: tbh, this should be usable onload, without any JS intervention, no?
[08:15:14] <seutje> currently, you start off hiding it
[08:15:15] <DRSK> seutje » hmph, good point. I guess JQ is obsolete thus far, but I tend to use it later so I figured this to be the 'init' part or whatnot.
[08:15:34] <DRSK> Oh you mean this should be 'usable' without JS?
[08:15:36] <bongjovi> BillCriswell, basically the top works, but below the --- doesn't. http://pastebin.com/cX45ztPy
[08:15:47] <seutje> sure, but you could position it in a usable way onload and have JS slap a "processed" class ot it or something, that you can target in CSS
[08:16:05] <jop008> In my code no edito icon also after the button change
[08:16:07] <seutje> and only when this class is applied, do you hide the submenus
[08:16:13] <jop008> button()
[08:16:15] <BillCriswell> bongjovi: Do you have to return it as a string?
[08:16:22] <seutje> then when their trigger is clicked, you could just swap out a class and do the styling based on that
[08:16:31] <seutje> making the plugin more re-usable
[08:16:45] <BillCriswell> return {"transition":"left 0.5s cubic-bezier(.6,.05,.4,.95), 0.5s ease opacity", "left":"-100%", "opacity":"0"}; instea.
[08:17:22] <bongjovi> BillCriswell, haha, thanks, stupid me.
[08:17:30] <DRSK> seutje » right, but say I have a class called "open" and another called "closed". How do I animate between them? Right now I'm using some reiiculous -500px thing top value. Any input on that?
[08:17:35] <bongjovi> That works great.
[08:17:42] <bongjovi> Silly mistake.
[08:17:45] <seutje> DRSK: css transitions
[08:17:54] <DRSK> seutje » I wish I could, but IE says no
[08:18:05] <DRSK> and I have to go down to 8.. :/
[08:18:07] <BillCriswell> bongjovi: Guilt of many of those.
[08:18:11] <seutje> well then catch that as your exception
[08:18:21] <BillCriswell> Mostly because I want to do things too quickly.
[08:18:24] <DRSK> CSS > JS fallback > no js/css3?
[08:18:31] <seutje> you can feature test css transitions
[08:18:48] <seutje> and does IE really need it to be animated?
[08:18:59] <seutje> sounds like very non-critical functionality
[08:19:06] <seutje> sugar-coating, if you will
[08:19:25] <DRSK> well, the entire page is to be a sort of competition so sugar is needed for its entirety so to speak
[08:20:43] <seutje> well, I suppose you could catch that by testing if the transitions are supported, if not, apply the class, read the computed style, remove the class, and animate to the computed style you grabbed earlier
[08:21:07] <DRSK> So anyway, you'd suggest me to test for CSS transition compatibility and just do the animation with transitions and classes instead. And if that fails, I can revert to some basic jq animation using the classes values? And if all that fails, well then I'm shit out of luck anyway. Or well, at least no sugar for the ppl.
[08:21:12] <seutje> that way cool browsers can still accelerate the poop out of it, and IE will get some sort of animation
[08:21:29] <seutje> yeah, sorta
[08:21:37] <BillCriswell> and hopefully die in the process so the user needs to get a new computer.
[08:21:47] <DRSK> all right, thanks! I appreciate it :)
[08:21:58] <seutje> just that you'll need to hop through an extra hoop if you wanna keep the value out of ur javamascripts
[08:22:26] <DRSK> how about transit?
[08:23:01] <seutje> like foo.addClass('open'); var computed = foo.css('top'); foo.removeClass('open').animate({'top': computed}, 1000) or something
[08:23:12] <seutje> (don't do that in a loop btw)
[08:23:24] <seutje> transit the library?
[08:23:41] <DRSK> Yeah I remember something about a lib helping with transitions but can't really remember the details ;p
[08:24:17] <seutje> can't say I have a lot of experience with transit
[08:24:54] <seutje> I tend to drop animations and transitions for oldIE
[08:26:12] <DRSK> Yeah I guess, I'd rather just do this in CSS and be done with it already but I know for a fact that 20 % of the intended visitors will be using XP and IE8.
[08:28:03] <DRSK> So I'm thinking, no JS? No go. If JS? Add specific JS-related class to say <html> or whatnot and test for transition support. If there is one, well then just use classes etc to animate the content, if there isn't any transition support, catch the "css" applied through the classes and animate these separately.
[08:28:31] <seutje> basically, yeah
[08:28:34] <DRSK> I'm guessing something like that would suffice, if I understood you correctly?
[08:28:40] <DRSK> Right, thank you for clarifying!
[08:29:01] <seutje> u can use Modernizr for checking the transition support, just don't drop an entire Modernizr in there just to check that, u can easily lift the test out of there :P
[08:31:31] <DRSK> seutje » ahh right, I'll just build a custom one, I need the shiv anyway :p
[08:31:51] <jop008> I am trying to build a selectlist using autocomplete this works fine for adding items. But how to delete items previous selected any good idea?
[08:32:06] <jop008> Another issue is reordering the selected items
[08:32:53] <jop008> So I can add items and display them above the input box like this select1 , select2 , etc
[08:33:18] <jop008> So what is a good user interface with minimum of code
[08:33:53] <jop008> It can be useful in all kind of sites
[08:36:34] <bongjovi> Can anyone help me with this super short function? How can I pass the var direction properly in line 4? http://pastebin.com/tU2zRMuc
[08:36:44] <bongjovi> works fine in line 3
[08:38:11] <decx> variable as key is different
[08:38:29] <bongjovi> Yeah, I thought that would be the problem
[08:40:17] <bongjovi> Ahh, okay, so best to define a variable and use var[key] = x; ?
[08:40:53] <decx> yeah that's what i use, but to have it separately in a return function should work somehow, i forgot
[08:41:19] <bongjovi> I'll give that a go, thanks decx, much appreciated
[08:47:01] <bongjovi> Amazing, works perfectly. Thanks again.
[08:50:53] <fabioportieri> bongjovi cool nick ahaha
[08:52:17] <decx> i assume you just put your transition and opacity in an object, then added you var key to that object and returned it, i checked my archive and that's what i did
[08:52:34] <pyed> shoky: you here ?
[08:55:18] <duch_kazatel> goood morning #jquery
[08:58:51] <BillCriswell> I just had the weirdest issue.
[08:59:14] <duch_kazatel> you started writing in javascript?
[08:59:16] <duch_kazatel> :)
[08:59:39] <BillCriswell> <a><strong>Some Text</strong></a> mousing out of this made text disappear... <strong><a>Some Text</a></strong> works fine.
[08:59:54] <duch_kazatel> woah.  really?
[08:59:57] <BillCriswell> No idea what is causing that one.
[09:00:04] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: Yeah, no fun.
[09:00:23] <duch_kazatel> works fine in a fiddle, too.  bizarro.
[09:01:16] <BillCriswell> Yeah, I'm sure it's nothing normal. Just tracing the issue to an origin is being a pain in the ass.
[09:01:31] <duch_kazatel> that's neat.
[09:01:35] <decx> huh
[09:01:45] <BillCriswell> Dealing with other peoples code is no fun.
[09:02:25] <duch_kazatel> especially old legacy stuff.
[09:02:41] <BillCriswell> It's weird, the text vanishes, but messing with any of the properties on the element brings it back.
[09:03:08] <duch_kazatel> css properties?  or jquery properties?  because that sounds like you've got some kind of controller thing going on if the latter.
[09:03:24] <BillCriswell> Just css properties.
[09:03:51] <duch_kazatel> ah yeah i remember running into those all the time back in the day.  it's always some bizarre munged rendered thing.
[09:04:02] <duch_kazatel> and i'll bet there's a reset stylesheet in use, too.
[09:13:12] <SprkDev> yeah trying to do ajax validation of login form.
[09:13:16] <SprkDev> Something wrong with this script. http://pastebin.com/xp0vR57v
[09:13:44] <duch_kazatel> what's happening?
[09:14:45] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/9WcR7/ < you have a minor syntax error btw.
[09:14:49] <duch_kazatel> *had
[09:16:10] <duch_kazatel> SprkDev line 23 in the fiddle, put that in a complete callback
[09:17:45] <SprkDev> oh thanks! but. I don't think the reg1 part on 13,14 is actually doing anything. I want to retrieve login credentials result.
[09:17:54] <jop008> Can you trap the closure of a selectlist dalogue?
[09:18:05] <SprkDev> whiich is bascailly sql querying the the wp_user table
[09:18:17] <duch_kazatel> SprkDev what does your console say?
[09:20:58] <SprkDev> it looks like I am getting empty results from wp-login such as log=&pwd
[09:21:09] <jop008> Can you trap the end of this dialogue? http://demos.jquerymobile.com/1.0a4.1/docs/forms/forms-selects.html
[09:21:09] <duch_kazatel> there's your problem.
[09:21:27] <duch_kazatel> "trap the end of this dialogue"? huh?
[09:22:10] <duch_kazatel> SprkDev are you sending that info via the URL or something?  why are you regexing an entire return like that?
[09:23:05] <SprkDev> I probably did it wrong. I just want to see if username and password are valid or not.
[09:24:07] <rethus> how can i set accordion to collapse all at startup
[09:24:47] <NotHere> is there any jquery slider plugin which can do full width, fixed height?
[09:25:21] <duch_kazatel> NotHere sure - use CSS and override stuff.
[09:30:24] <jop008> Can you open a selectbox using JS?
[09:30:34] <duch_kazatel> jop008 probably.
[09:31:16] <jop008> depending on?
[09:31:42] <duch_kazatel> a large variety of factors.  you can do a lot, but it's hard to suggest anything with the questiopns you've had so far this morning.  supplying a code example with be baller.
[09:34:11] <caciavar> hi all
[09:35:15] <caciavar> i'm having a heck of a time trying to make a textbox flash upon ajaxsuccess
[09:35:22] <caciavar> i have 5 checkboxes
[09:35:31] <caciavar> *5 textareas
[09:35:55] <caciavar> when the 1st one is changed, then it flashes
[09:36:13] <caciavar> when the 2nd one is changed then it, and the previous textarea flashes
[09:36:22] <caciavar> its as if $this is cached or something
[09:36:29] <NotHere> duch_kazatel, how do I override via css? If for example I say img { width: 100%; height: 150px;} the images will get stretched and not cropped left and right as they should be
[09:38:17] <duch_kazatel> NotHere "cropped left and right" <- can you clarify?
[09:39:05] <duch_kazatel> you want the image height to occupy 100% of the container, regardless of the width.  yeah?
[09:39:50] <NotHere> yes. And I also want to occupy the full width...
[09:40:01] <NotHere> let me provide an example...
[09:42:02] <NotHere> say you have an image 2560x350px. When browser window is 980px wide, the image is shown 980 pixel wide with the rest clipped off and height 350px (the original)
[09:42:34] <NotHere> if browser window is 2560px wide then the full image will be displayed
[09:45:22] <BinaryKitten> NotHere use CSS
[09:45:32] <BinaryKitten> also, try to use smaller images
[09:45:35] <zumba_addict> Hey guys, I wrote a very simple code and I'm wondering why the random number is getting added to the end of the uri. http://localhost/checkOS?_=1394469801651
[09:45:37] <antihero> is there a way to make a global beforeSend with $.ajax, that DOESN'T get overriden by someone else's code
[09:46:45] <zumba_addict> and it's weird I don't have any cache buster
[09:47:00] <jfvhyevcnew> zumba_addict:areu kidding?  did you just link to your localhost? XD
[09:47:08] <zumba_addict> yes
[09:47:13] <jfvhyevcnew> Hey guys... :D
[09:47:38] <SprkDev> I've managed to do it. Thank for all the advice. cheers
[09:47:39] <zumba_addict> jfvhyevcnew: I have a local apache running on my laptop
[09:47:44] <duch_kazatel> zumba_addict you realize we can't see that, right?
[09:47:54] <duch_kazatel> localhost won't resolve to your laptop magically.
[09:48:03] <zumba_addict> it will
[09:48:07] <duch_kazatel> not for us.
[09:48:14] <NotHere> BinaryKitten, something like putting it all in a {width: 100%; height: 350px; overflow: hidden;} container and telling the js slider to present full size centered images?
[09:48:14] <zumba_addict> of course, it;s only local
[09:48:26] <duch_kazatel> aaaaaah, nvm ignore moe.
[09:48:28] <zumba_addict> but my code is only jquery.js and my own js. I'll pastebin it
[09:48:33] <BinaryKitten> oh it's a slider?
[09:48:36] <zumba_addict> it's very small code
[09:48:44] <duch_kazatel> zumba_addict you're probably doing cachebusting somewhere.
[09:48:55] <jfvhyevcnew> Hey guys...! I have to attach the function .resize()   to another css property... is it possible?    I.E.:  While resizing a div, the padding of another div changes synchronously!
[09:49:00] <zumba_addict> i don't recall any
[09:49:15] <jfvhyevcnew> how would you do it?
[09:49:16] <zumba_addict> or maybe there is some library that is currently on
[09:49:28] <zumba_addict> but I opened up firefox and it is doing the same thing
[09:49:38] <zumba_addict> i'll post the code, really weird
[09:50:15] <duch_kazatel> jfvhyevcnew you can't do that.  you'd need to set a manual click + drag handler.
[09:50:35] <jop008> A lot of reading on this subject how to open a selectbox (jquery mobile one)
[09:50:45] <jop008> Is this possible and how?
[09:50:59] <jfvhyevcnew> manual click for what, excuse me?
[09:51:34] <jop008> open the selectbox by JS
[09:51:40] <jop008> how to do that?
[09:51:48] <duch_kazatel> jop008 fiddle what you have so far.
[09:51:49] <zumba_addict> jfvhyevcnew: http://pastebin.com/wRSqDMpA
[09:52:00] <zumba_addict> I'll try it on safari :)
[09:52:01] <jop008> like this
[09:52:09] <duch_kazatel> zumba_addict cache: false, - that's doing it.
[09:52:19] <zumba_addict> ah cool
[09:52:20] <zumba_addict> :)
[09:52:26] <jop008> http://demos.jquerymobile.com/1.0a4.1/docs/forms/forms-selects.html
[09:52:28] <duch_kazatel> jfvhyevcnew click and drag handlers.
[09:52:33] <zumba_addict> i thought it was just telling the server not to cache it
[09:52:40] <jfvhyevcnew> uff
[09:52:49] <zumba_addict> thanks duch_kazatel
[09:52:51] <jop008> the item under Multiple selects
[09:52:55] <duch_kazatel> zumba_addict right, but appending a random string of numbers to the end of the request URL
[09:53:01] <jop008> that is what I have
[09:53:18] <zumba_addict> that means, i really don't have to add more header on the server side response
[09:53:24] <Guest12259> Hi all, I'm having an annoying issue parsing HTML strings with jQuery. I'm parsing some HTML, and I get extra a tags in the output. http://jsfiddle.net/aU5H5/5/  Does anyone have any ideas why?
[09:53:31] <zumba_addict> i added pragma cache none and 2 more lines
[09:53:37] <zumba_addict> expiration to 1970
[09:54:32] <duch_kazatel> jop008 you just want to open it?  click on it.
[09:54:39] <duch_kazatel> you can also .trigger('click'); instead.
[09:54:57] <jop008> yes open
[09:55:17] <jop008> so trigger click should work?
[09:56:11] <duch_kazatel> sure, but i have no idea why you'd do that.
[09:57:48] <rethus>  how can i set accordion to collapse all at startup
[09:59:44] <decx> isn't that default behaviour?
[10:00:21] <decx> ah, no always the first
[10:00:51] <decx> active: 0 maybe?
[10:01:47] <shoky> Setting active to false will collapse all panels. This requires the collapsible option to be true.
[10:02:19] <shoky> http://api.jqueryui.com/accordion/#option-active
[10:03:32] <decx> looking at the actual documentation, that's cheating ;)
[10:04:47] <shoky> uhhh i had it memorized !
[10:05:41] <jop008> http://jsfiddle.net/RhWgf/483/ got it
[10:06:58] <Guest12259> Is there a kind soul around who could help me with an¨ HTML
[10:06:58] <decx> i don'T get why it's called jquery mobile, should be called "mobile template and behaviour framework"
[10:07:35] <Guest12259> Is there a kind soul around who could help me with a jQuery HTML parsing issue?
[10:07:43] <decx> dont ask to ask
[10:07:59] <decx> pop that shirt off and type your question
[10:09:12] <Guest12259> Ok, when I try this: $('<div><div><a href="http://placekitten.com/200/300"><img src="http://placekitten.com/200/300"/><div/><ul><li><a href="www.eb.dk">link</a></li></ul></a></div></div>').html() I get a few extra a tags in the parsed result
[10:09:56] <Guest12259> Why do they get inserted?
[10:10:52] <duch_kazatel> Guest12259 what are the extra tags?
[10:11:19] <duch_kazatel> holy god this code review isn't going to end well.
[10:12:00] <Guest12259> The output is this: <div><a href="http://placekitten.com/200/300"><img src="http://placekitten.com/200/300"><div></div></a><ul><a href="http://placekitten.com/200/300"></a><li><a href="http://placekitten.com/200/300"></a><a href="www.eb.dk">link</a></li></ul></div>
[10:12:40] <rethus> decx: shoky: active: 0 not work
[10:12:55] <duch_kazatel> Guest12259 use a fiddle instead please.
[10:13:20] <rethus> active: false does
[10:14:22] <Guest12259> duch_kazatel: http://jsfiddle.net/aU5H5/6/
[10:15:53] <BillCriswell> Guest12259: It's not valid.
[10:17:13] <duch_kazatel> yeah Guest12259 that's invalid markup.
[10:17:48] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/aU5H5/8/ - see the issue?
[10:19:33] <Guest12259> Ah, the div close after the img tag?
[10:20:19] <Genitrust> just curious, does anyone here actually use firefox's default inspector?
[10:20:33] <Guest12259> Hmm, that was supposed to be an empty div
[10:20:35] <Genitrust> i'm thinking about not installing firebug... butttt big problem is i cannot see my console.log()s in here -.-
[10:20:35] <duch_kazatel> Guest12259 you have anb unclosed anchor tag.
[10:20:52] <duch_kazatel> Genitrust it's there.
[10:20:58] <duch_kazatel> Guest12259 empty divs are a bad idea in general.
[10:21:47] <Guest12259> duch_kazatel: I know, in the real scenario that'd have content. I don't see the unclosed anchor?
[10:22:06] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/aU5H5/8/ line 3?
[10:22:14] <duch_kazatel> you can't wrap an anchor around everythjing like that.
[10:22:18] <duch_kazatel> no can your next anchoirs
[10:22:20] <duch_kazatel> *anchors
[10:22:46] <decx> sure you can wrap anchors
[10:22:55] <decx> just set display: block
[10:22:57] <duch_kazatel> lol
[10:23:04] <duch_kazatel> not with what he wants to do.
[10:24:24] <Genitrust> duch_kazatel, where is it? =\
[10:24:37] <Genitrust> i'm in the "console" tab
[10:25:11] <Genitrust> oh i see... "Logging" needs to be activated
[10:25:35] <jop008> I have this var myselect = $("#select-choice-9");   myselect.selectmenu("refresh"); and got this Uncaught Error: cannot call methods on selectmenu prior to initialization; attempted to call method 'refresh'
[10:25:42] <jop008> how to init the select?
[10:26:27] <cronin> say you have 10 input fields with values ranging from 5 - 100. Is there a way to use filter to determine the total number of input fields where the value is less than 50?
[10:26:38] <cronin> or do you have to loop through each and keep track?
[10:27:06] <pestrada> @jop008 I would say var myselect = $("#select-choice-9"); myselect.selectmenu(); myselect.selectmenu("refresh");
[10:27:22] <jop008> ok
[10:30:07] <Guest12259> duch_kazatel: Hmm, yes, closing the anchor off nicely immediately after the img tag solves the parsing problem. Thanks for the help :)
[10:35:12] <jop008> Can you listen for a click on a link and do something when title=:close"?
[10:50:49] <fiveofoh> jop008: Sure, you can even listen for a click just on links that have title=:close
[10:51:57] <fiveofoh> jop008: http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/attribute-selectors/ is what you're looking for
[10:53:42] <fiveofoh> jop008: And to explain the selectmenu thing above: selectmenu() is a jQuery widget, so you have to turn your select element into a selectmenu() widget before you can treat it as a widget (e.g. .selectmenu("refresh"))
[10:54:15] <fiveofoh> $().selectmenu() isn't just a function that does stuff to any old select element
[10:55:34] <jop008> I now have   $( "#select-choice-9-listbox" ).click(function(event) {      alert(event.target.id);   });
[10:56:19] <jop008> How to listen for an element with title close?
[10:56:28] <duch_kazatel> fiveofoh nope.
[10:56:30] <fiveofoh> Is #select-choice-9-listbox an anchor?
[10:56:34] <fiveofoh> duch_kazatel: Why not?
[10:56:42] <duch_kazatel> oh sorry reading now.
[10:56:51] <duch_kazatel> ignore me.
[10:56:51] <jop008> no it is the top of the selectbox
[10:56:52] <duch_kazatel> out of it today.
[10:57:03] <fiveofoh> jop008: Well where are the anchors you want to listen for
[10:57:04] <jop008> the only element with a proper id
[10:57:17] <jop008> within the tree of selectmenu
[10:57:55] <fiveofoh> Okay, then you'll also want .on(): http://api.jquery.com/on/
[10:58:34] <fiveofoh> You can attach a listener to the select element that will catch events on any of its child elements (such as the links), and can filter those events by a selector, such as the attr selectors
[11:00:56] <fiveofoh> jop008: Let me know if you have questions about the docs I linked
[11:01:23] <jop008> I try to use it now
[11:01:29] <jop008> but no luck
[11:02:40] <jop008> the on click is also active for all the children ?
[11:03:28] <fiveofoh> jop008: Events bubble up, so if an event isn't handled on the <a> element, it will get triggered on the <option> element, then on the <select> element, on up until it gets handled (or gets to <body>)
[11:04:03] <fiveofoh> So you can listen at <select> for any events at or inside the <select> element
[11:04:19] <jop008> okay
[11:04:29] <fiveofoh> Which is much more efficient than attaching them to all the children
[11:04:48] <fiveofoh> So, what code do you have so far (use a pastebin if its more than a line or so)
[11:06:45] <jop008> nothing is happening   $( "#select-choice-9-listbox" ).on( "click", function() {
[11:06:45] <jop008>       debugger;
[11:06:45] <jop008>     
[11:06:48] <duch_kazatel> a functioning jsfiddle would be nice, too.
[11:06:50] <jop008> debugger is not hit
[11:07:07] <mikeche1en> what is the best way with jquery mobile to put a text input form and submit button on the same line?
[11:09:39] <jop008> this is fiddle http://jsfiddle.net/RhWgf/485/
[11:09:39] <NoiseEee> jop008: is your debugger open?
[11:09:46] <jop008> try to listen for close
[11:09:59] <jop008> yes it is open as always
[11:10:34] <fiveofoh> jop008: That will listen for clicks on the select element.  You can use the second parameter to specify what child elements you want to listen for
[11:10:58] <Torsten85> Hey, jQuery 1.11 should support IE8 right?
[11:11:00] <duch_kazatel> are you wanting to listen to clicks?  or to the change even?
[11:11:02] <jop008> but first of all no reaction at all
[11:11:06] <duch_kazatel> Torsten85 yeah it does.
[11:11:08] <fiveofoh> So .on("click","a",function(){}) would catch events on the links
[11:11:42] <Torsten85> I'm getting a weird "ownerDocument.defaultView is null or not an object" error
[11:12:49] <djcomidi> if a jquery ajax get call worked an hour ago, but now refuses to get the data, how can i figure out why it doesn't work ?
[11:13:04] <jop008> I changed it http://jsfiddle.net/RhWgf/486/
[11:13:14] <duch_kazatel> Torsten85 that's not a jquery problem.  that's a javascript one - var doc= el.ownerDocument; var win= 'defaultView' in doc? doc.defaultView : doc.parentWindow;
[11:13:17] <jop008> but no alert
[11:13:24] <jop008> clicking on close
[11:14:11] <NoiseEee> jop008: those aren't a tags?
[11:14:32] <jop008> I looked with inspector
[11:14:51] <fiveofoh> jop008: Oh I see, you're trying to listen to the <a> tag being added by selectemen()
[11:14:52] <jop008> <a is the parent from the span
[11:15:03] <jop008> Yes!
[11:15:04] <NoiseEee> jop008: aren't they in "rentper-listbox-popup" and not "rentper-listbox" ?
[11:15:23] <BillCriswell> Wish I could nap standing up sometimes.
[11:15:23] <fiveofoh> That already is handled, so you do have to attach a listener directly to it, because once it's handled it won't bubble up any more
[11:15:25] <jop008> Maybe I did inspect element
[11:16:05] <jop008> rentper-dialog
[11:16:08] <fiveofoh> So, $('#selectbox a[title=whatever]').on("click",function(){});
[11:16:47] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell that would rock.
[11:19:10] <BillCriswell> If someone on heroin can do it I should be able to as well.
[11:20:26] <duch_kazatel> lmao
[11:22:01] <decx> that's how my father convinced me to smuggle a cake in my ass into prison
[11:22:48] <BillCriswell> Wendle Shorteyes... didn't I stab you once?
[11:23:05] <decx> lol
[11:23:21] <fiveofoh> jop008: So do you understand the issue there? The selectbox() functions are already handling the click on that link, so it doesn't bubble up.  You have to attach directly to the link
[11:23:24] <jop008> $('#rentper-dialog a[title="Close"]').on("click",function(){
[11:23:25] <jop008>     alert( "clicked " );
[11:23:55] <jop008> http://jsfiddle.net/RhWgf/490/ nothing changed
[11:24:42] <jop008> But the close button will be handled also by the select box
[11:24:50] <jop008> sh no way to trap this?
[11:26:42] <fiveofoh> jop008: That's what I have, and I'm getting the alert.  Are you getting an alert?
[11:27:04] <jop008> No alert did you edit the fiddle?
[11:27:11] <fiveofoh> Oh, let me look at your fiddle
[11:29:47] <fiveofoh> jop008: I don't see any #rentper-dialog, looks like #rentper-listbox is the container of it
[11:30:46] <fiveofoh> That's what you had in the previous fiddle, and with the #rentper-listbox it works for me
[11:31:44] <jop008> okay inspect element is not that easy
[11:32:21] <fiveofoh> If you want to prevent it from closing, you can event.stopPropagation(), and it will keep the .selectbox() event from firing (since it won't propagate/bubble up any further)
[11:33:42] <jop008> can you change the fiddle http://jsfiddle.net/RhWgf/491/?
[11:34:12] <pestrada> jop008: what is your end goal?
[11:34:43] <fiveofoh> Yeah, that's my next question - we may be trying to solve a problem that is better addressed a different way
[11:36:14] <duch_kazatel> is jop008 doing that thing again where he's giving us "warm-up" questions?
[11:37:03] <jop008> ??
[11:40:02] <djcomidi> if an ajax call hits success some hours ago but now it only hits error, how can i figure out what's wrong ?
[11:40:10] <duch_kazatel> djcomidi your console.
[11:41:00] <fiveofoh> djcomidi: My guess is that whatever you're calling to broke between now and then
[11:41:21] <fiveofoh> The network tab in Chrome/Firefox/Firebug will show you what requests your making and what responses you got
[11:41:31] <duch_kazatel> firebug's console will also tell you.
[11:41:39] <duch_kazatel> no need for the network tab in that one :)
[11:41:45] <fiveofoh> Ah yes, that's true
[11:41:48] * fiveofoh still prefers the network tab
[11:42:33] <djcomidi> i'm already logging to the console (Chrome inspector) but the only value i see is statusText: "error"
[11:43:00] <duch_kazatel> djcomidi look at the actual network request.
[11:43:20] <jop008> I can find it listen for close on a select
[11:43:31] <sunbeam> hi, i'd like to do a for each for each class starting with width-
[11:43:46] <sunbeam> then for each i'd like to check the value after width (if its more than 0)
[11:43:48] <sunbeam> how can I best do that?
[11:44:12] <duch_kazatel> sunbeam have a fiddle setup?
[11:44:48] <decx> the value after width?
[11:45:34] <duch_kazatel> i think he's got something like class="width-110" or something
[11:45:44] <decx> ah
[11:45:57] <duch_kazatel> but if that's the case, it's gross and wrong :)
[11:47:42] <fiveofoh> jop008:  I would have expected selectmenu() to have a close() function
[11:47:50] <fiveofoh> But it seems not to
[11:48:20] <sunbeam> duch_kazatel: not yet
[11:51:29] <jop008> No there is no close option
[11:51:38] <jop008> maybe I can hide it
[11:54:18] <fiveofoh> jop008: What, you don't want people to be able to close the select box?
[11:54:44] <Ericx2x> hey is anyone capable of imitatting this scroll-fadein effect on http://adayinbigdata.com/ ? I'm failing miserably.
[11:54:48] <Ericx2x> http://jsfiddle.net/9X68X/1/
[11:55:22] <jop008> Yes it is a modal dialogue so close will be good enough also :-) Sorry
[11:56:16] <decx> there's neither a #one, #two, or #three in there Ericx2x
[11:56:47] <jop008> not really I must hide the dialogue for the user the dialogue is some help for the user
[11:56:59] <jop008> after that it must be vanished
[11:57:23] <jop008> So after a close the selectbox must be hidden
[11:57:30] <dmchale92> If I have a table and jquery plugin like the following code : http://pastebin.com/uNsx6Gy6 what steps would I take to make that function accept a table with a class like table1 as input and then replace the numbers with the text provided?
[11:59:00] <dmchale92> Cleaner code : http://pastebin.com/6R50eGKq
[11:59:24] <duch_kazatel> dmchale92 are you trying to write a plugin?  or are you trying to write a separate function?
[11:59:29] <Genitrust> hmm, anyone know a 'best' way to turn off browser autocomplete for a field? =\
[11:59:32] <Genitrust> (jquery does this?)
[11:59:45] <dmchale92> I'm trying to write a plugin, I just have it plugged in to the main index for testing at the moment.
[11:59:54] <dmchale92> have a plugins.js file set up in /js/
[11:59:59] <fiveofoh> Genitrust: autocomplete="off" attribute
[12:00:33] <dmchale92> I want a plugin where I can input a table with a single column of numbers and replace the numbers with fizz, buzz, fizzbuzz, or uncool.
[12:00:38] <Genitrust> $('#item').setAttribute('autocomplete', 'off'); ?
[12:00:51] <duch_kazatel> dmchale92 if you want to use a plugin, just use $(this) to refer to the object.  $('table').TableFizzbuzz()
[12:01:06] <duch_kazatel> and then inside of TableFizzbuzz(), this refers to the table.
[12:01:15] <dmchale92> Ah, okay
[12:01:28] <duch_kazatel> Genitrust do it in the HTML instead.  and use .attr() instead of setAttribute()
[12:02:29] <dmchale92> So would return this.filter( "td" ).each(function() select each row of table data?
[12:02:31] <duch_kazatel> i just had a coworker inform me he has been told to not comment his code.  ever.
[12:02:34] <Genitrust> ah you're right duch_kazatel  better to do in html, ty
[12:02:50] <decx> well written code is all the comment you need
[12:03:02] <duch_kazatel> decx he was told to never do it.  like, ever.  for any reason.\
[12:03:11] <duch_kazatel> and the quality of the code is...
[12:03:12] <Genitrust> duch_kazatel, ah never mind, i MUST use javascript to do it i think ... because i'm using django forms with twitter bootstrap decorators -.-
[12:03:12] <duch_kazatel> wel....
[12:03:23] <decx> yeah in an enterprise scenario it's bound to be... well... yes
[12:03:27] <fiveofoh> duch_kazatel: You sure he didn't misinterpret "don't comment *out* code"?
[12:03:28] <duch_kazatel> Genitrust that doesn't explain why, but OK.
[12:03:39] <duch_kazatel> fiveofoh yes.
[12:03:46] <Genitrust> ya it explains why... basically much easier for me to use jquery instead of setting it in the html :D
[12:03:54] <duch_kazatel> Genitrust eh, not really, but OK.
[12:04:10] <fiveofoh> duch_kazatel: Becuase the HTML is generated by django, etc, so  Genitrust doesn't have direct access to the outputted html
[12:04:24] <duch_kazatel> right, so modify what django is doing.
[12:04:34] <duch_kazatel> unless there's a really good reason otherwise.
[12:04:39] <fiveofoh> Most generative HTML stuff I've seen has an option to add arbitrary attributes, but I don't know Django
[12:04:48] <duch_kazatel> django is basically like that.
[12:06:24] <jop008> Since the select dialogue is a modal dialogue can I do something with it? Maybe the body got foucs?
[12:06:32] <jop008> Or something like that?
[12:07:22] <Ericx2x> how do you make a div have a scale in effect?
[12:08:20] <Ericx2x> nevermind i think i found it
[12:09:52] <Genitrust> duch_kazatel, that'd be do-able if i could modify the library, but company policy says no.
[12:09:59] <Genitrust> duch_kazatel, so you know, basically gotta do what ya gotta do
[12:10:00] <duch_kazatel> Genitrust that's... scary.
[12:10:04] <jop008> I have the xpath of the close button //*[@id="rentper-dialog"]/div/div[1]/a/span/span[2] can I do something with it?
[12:10:16] <Genitrust> not really, it makes ops job much easier for deployment
[12:10:35] <Genitrust> ...and less dev time, etc.
[12:10:37] <Genitrust> :D
[12:10:37] <duch_kazatel> Genitrust that's not a good separation of concerns imo.
[12:10:51] <Genitrust> well ya know, when the company demands it, and is paying your paycheck... kinda gotta follow that
[12:11:07] <Genitrust> *sigh* steakholders don't always have the best decision... that's biz...
[12:11:16] <duch_kazatel> if my company told me to do that, i'd explain why it's a bad idea.  if they kept telling me "too bad", I'd find another place to work.
[12:11:23] <Genitrust> duch_kazatel, the delay with my chat was me going to supervisor asking about this :D
[12:11:43] <Genitrust> really? personally, i'd find another place to work if they were asses about it, but they're just firm and happy
[12:12:00] <Genitrust> gotta work as a team, if the team still thinks it's a bad idea, gotta go with what the team says
[12:12:04] <jop008> If I search for the close button using xpath can I attach a click on that?
[12:13:02] <duch_kazatel> they're paying me to be the developer.  my job is to know how to implement something.  if the non-developer stakeholders tell me how to do something and it's not the right way to do it, I explain why.
[12:13:11] <duch_kazatel> it's not up to them to implement it.
[12:13:11] <decx> i wish i was a steakholder
[12:13:20] <duch_kazatel> mmmm steak.
[12:13:38] <hgjkl> Hi... how can i hide a "modal" box once a link inside it has been clicked?   (twitter-bootstrap)
[12:13:39] <Genitrust> duch_kazatel, are you a contractor? or full time employee?
[12:13:45] <duch_kazatel> full time.
[12:13:54] <duch_kazatel> if i were a contractor, that might be a different story.
[12:13:57] <duch_kazatel> maybe.
[12:14:04] <Genitrust> ;)
[12:14:15] <ankurk_> duch_kazatel: How much time did it take you to find your first full time?
[12:14:18] <decx> Genitrust you gotta learn to talk business to decisionmakers or you'll always be walked over
[12:14:39] <duch_kazatel> exactly.
[12:14:45] <duch_kazatel> ankurk_ what do you mean?
[12:14:52] <Genitrust> decx, hah you serious? this isn't a business talk... it's a, "i dont have control over the bootstrap code... can i have access to modify it for this pain-in-the-butt issue?" lead: "nope"
[12:15:05] <duch_kazatel> Genitrust then tell them to have one of their guys do it.
[12:15:10] <ankurk_> I mean, in how many days you found your first full time?
[12:15:16] <hgjkl> http://madartweb.com/resetplay/ <------ look at the "Podcast" toggle   ....... once i click on a link, it gets opened in another tab. then i go back, and the "modal" box is still open. How to avoid that? How to close it?
[12:15:30] <ankurk_> asking because I will be on a search for full time in few months as well
[12:15:40] <duch_kazatel> ankurk_ a few years?  i started work doing data entry and worked my way up through the ranks to a developer gig.
[12:15:56] <Genitrust> me: "but here's the issue... blah blah..", lead: "ahh ya that makes sense. let me hit up so-and-so and find out if that'll work with our process." :: later :: "lead, ah sorry man, not for this scenario. but thanks for letting us kno, so-and-so will find out if we can change things to make that happen. will let ya kno...ty for the heads up"
[12:16:06] <ankurk_> oh, everyone has a different story I guess
[12:16:32] <Genitrust> so ya kno, sounds like jquery it is.
[12:16:40] <duch_kazatel> Genitrust as long as you're leaving big fat ugly comments as a CYA.
[12:17:03] <duch_kazatel> i got conditioned into self preservation long ago.
[12:17:15] <duch_kazatel> and ankurk_ yeah, we do :) are you graduating college soon?
[12:17:21] <Genitrust> 1 line of code, verse perhaps 3, and changing a business process... i was a little annoyed but after "defending" their position and listening to you guys, i'm happier abt it
[12:17:27] <Genitrust> duch_kazatel, hah
[12:17:30] <BillCriswell> If I ever figure out where I'm putting all my pens I'm going to have a lot of pens.
[12:17:50] <ankurk_> duch_kazatel: yeah I am graduating this April :) Honestly, I am quite stressed out
[12:17:55] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell for a sec I didn't read that as pens at first.
[12:18:10] <duch_kazatel> ankurk_ do you have a portfolio of some kind?
[12:18:26] <ankurk_> nope :(
[12:18:28] <BillCriswell> I hope I never misplace that.
[12:18:55] <duch_kazatel> ankurk_ i'd work on getting something together so you have experience to show.
[12:19:13] <jop008> Can you use xpath to get an element?
[12:19:17] <BillCriswell> http://crswll.com/ in 11 days it'll be 2 years since I started blogging.
[12:19:18] <ankurk_> I am going to start on one this week, I gotta make one
[12:19:33] <jop008> I know the xpath element //*[@id="rentper-dialog"]/div/div[1]/a/span/span[2]
[12:20:01] <duch_kazatel> jop008 nope, you have to use a CSS style selector.
[12:20:11] <dmchale92> This doesn't seem to be appending the test data to td rows, have I done something wrong? http://pastebin.com/Cu5cR6S1
[12:20:12] <fiveofoh> jop008: Jquery doesn't do xpath, but your last fiddle was working fine on my end
[12:20:15] <justpie> Would anyone happen to know why the following code : slider.find('object').css({'display':'inline'}).stop().animate({'left':0}, 600); won't animate my object?
[12:20:34] <jop008> Define fine?
[12:20:40] <jop008> which fiddle?
[12:20:47] <ankurk_> duch_kazatel: moreover, one issue I have is I am out of ideas on projects to include
[12:20:51] <fiveofoh> jop008: Popped up a dialog box when I clicked on the close button
[12:21:10] <BillCriswell> #rentper-dialog > div > div:eq(1) > a > span > span:eq(2) ?
[12:21:14] <jop008> Which fiddle?
[12:21:20] <BillCriswell> A selector should never have to be that terrible.
[12:21:22] <fiveofoh> jop008: http://jsfiddle.net/RhWgf/491/
[12:21:48] <fiveofoh> BillCriswell: It doesn't, #rentper-listobx a[title="Close"] works just fine
[12:21:57] <BillCriswell> Phew.
[12:22:03] <fiveofoh> BillCriswell: Terrible *and* delicate
[12:22:12] <decx> fyi that's still inefficient and would benefit from context
[12:22:15] <jop008> Thanks no finding out which one :-)
[12:22:30] <duch_kazatel> dmchale92 http://jsfiddle.net/p4g4r/1/ start here.
[12:22:38] <fiveofoh> decx: Context?
[12:22:44] <duch_kazatel> dmchale92 think about why that wouldn't work.
[12:22:58] <BillCriswell> justpie: Inever tried animating an object before... also making it diplay inline wouldn't allow you to use left on it.. so it could be a few things.
[12:23:13] <decx> fiveofoh instead of $('#myparent a') you can do $('a','#myparent') it's much more efficient
[12:23:25] <decx> it's like $('#myparent').find('a') in short
[12:24:06] <justpie> BillCriswell : Thanks, Changed it to block, still not working
[12:24:17] <duch_kazatel> dmchale92 fyi .filter() doesn't do what you think it does.
[12:24:19] <duch_kazatel> try .find()
[12:24:21] <fiveofoh> decx: Huh, I wasn't aware of that syntax.  I think I'd rather just use .find()
[12:24:32] <fiveofoh> $() is already overloaded enough :P
[12:24:32] <BillCriswell> justpie: Could just be that it's an object then.
[12:24:38] <BillCriswell> justpie: Are you using position: relative?
[12:24:49] <decx> whatever works best for you ^^
[12:25:05] * fiveofoh is still unclear on when find() is more efficient
[12:25:13] <duch_kazatel> fiveofoh basically, always.
[12:25:29] <duch_kazatel> because it limits where the selector is looking contextually.
[12:25:50] <duch_kazatel> decx has a jsperf for it iirc.
[12:26:10] <ankurk_> on a side note, I won a free coffee today
[12:26:16] <BillCriswell> justpie: http://jsbin.com/koqaqila/1/edit?html,css,output
[12:26:17] <justpie> BillCriswell : Ya, i was. however, I just fixed it by removing the animation and just using CSS transition.
[12:26:27] <BillCriswell> justpie: Word.
[12:26:33] <decx> it doesn't have a benchmark prototyp kerfuffel so i don't know how exact it is duch_kazatel
[12:26:52] <duch_kazatel> meh, it's good enough imo.
[12:27:01] <duch_kazatel> also: ++ for using the word "kerfuffel"
[12:27:03] <decx> fiveofoh http://jsperf.com/findvschildren/2
[12:27:21] <duch_kazatel> dmchale92 http://jsfiddle.net/p4g4r/2/ for more info.
[12:28:06] <dmchale92> Thanks duch_kazatel , I'll get it working. :)
[12:28:47] <duch_kazatel> all right folks, brb.
[12:29:17] <decx> missed opportunity to name yourself lunch_kazatel
[12:35:56] <Ericx2x> Can someone help me do this jsfiddle? http://jsfiddle.net/D8DZP/
[12:36:52] <martisj> Is there a way to see which event listeners are attached to a html element?
[12:44:37] <NoiseEee> martisj: not really, certainly not within a script
[12:45:54] <decx> Ericx2x i suggest you do that stuff with transitions and not with jquery ui here's a heads up with a script i use from time to time http://jsfiddle.net/decx/D8DZP/1/
[12:47:11] <martisj> NoiseEee: what about from the browser?
[12:47:30] <NoiseEee> martisj: i think chrome lets you inspect an element and has a pane about attached listeners
[12:48:10] <NoiseEee> martisj: but if you're trying to find out if <a> has a listener based on $(someParent).on('click','a',function(){}) i don't think you'll ever know / find it
[12:48:12] <duch_lunch> IE11 has that, too.
[12:48:31] <martisj> NoiseEee: hmm ok thanks
[13:03:06] <ankurk_> Can anyone point out to me why $.inArray part is not working for me? http://jsbin.com/soxecixo/5/
[13:03:24] <ankurk_> I need to hide those options which have values the array I declared
[13:03:51] <ankurk_> *in
[13:04:48] <duch_kazatel> you want to test if the return is > -1
[13:07:38] <ankurk_> I just want to hide the option whose values equal the numbers in the array
[13:08:57] <ankurk_> I think I know what I am doing wrong
[13:09:48] <ankurk_> Damn it, I forgot > -1 in the $.inArray condition
[13:09:59] <ankurk_> thank you duch_kazatel :)
[13:11:09] <duch_kazatel> of course.
[13:14:03] <Ericx2x> thanks decx
[13:15:09] <thoraxe> http://jsfiddle.net/U2rRQ/ I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong here... but the alert contains no text
[13:15:18] <thoraxe> and ih ave something almost exactly the same on another page and it does return text in the alert
[13:15:21] <thoraxe> i'm quite baffled
[13:15:41] <duch_kazatel> you wand .val()
[13:15:48] <duch_kazatel> *want .val()
[13:16:04] <ankurk_> you beat me to it duch_kazatel :P
[13:16:06] <duch_kazatel> also, no need to paste all that in the fiddle.
[13:16:07] <thoraxe> hmm
[13:17:21] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/U2rRQ/2/
[13:17:30] <duch_kazatel> be cool and use jsfiddle right.
[13:22:18] <Edulix> hi people
[13:22:30] <pestrada> herro
[13:27:44] <yjokhyijk> how can i target a class inside a specific element_
[13:27:46] <yjokhyijk> ?
[13:27:58] <duch_kazatel> yjokhyijk huh?>
[13:28:06] <duch_kazatel> like, a child of an element with a given class?
[13:28:10] <NoiseEee> target a class?  like <a class='poochie'> ?  $('a.poochie')
[13:29:00] <duch_kazatel> $('element .class') to find any child of element with class '.class'.  same with $('element').find('.class');
[13:29:03] <Morl0ck> child elements are separated by a space e.g. $('div .someClass')
[13:29:06] <yjokhyijk> You know, I have many divs  with the class I have to target...............  i want to target a specific class, but not ALL the elements with that,  I want ONLY  the childs of one #id  that have that class
[13:29:27] <duch_kazatel> $('#id .class')
[13:29:33] <yjokhyijk> yo? okay thank you
[13:29:42] <duch_kazatel> $('.class', '#id');
[13:29:44] <yjokhyijk> sorry for the newbieness
[13:29:51] <duch_kazatel> $('#id').find('.class)
[13:29:56] <duch_kazatel> err $('#id').find('.class')
[13:30:07] <duch_kazatel> it's just like CSS.
[13:30:15] <yjokhyijk> whic one is the best?   Personally  I like   $('#id.class')
[13:30:22] <duch_kazatel> that doesn't do what you want it to.
[13:30:24] <Morl0ck> not together
[13:30:26] <Morl0ck> with a space
[13:30:34] <Morl0ck> $('#id .class')
[13:30:37] <decx> find is fastest
[13:30:49] <duch_kazatel> $('.class', '#id'); and $('#id').find('.class'); are the "best" imo.
[13:30:57] <Morl0ck> or as duch suggested use .find()
[13:31:07] <yjokhyijk> okay  find() is the fastest one
[13:31:14] <yjokhyijk> duch_kazatel: what do you say
[13:31:21] <Morl0ck> i agree, $('#id').find('.class')
[13:31:21] <yjokhyijk> i want everybody s opinion xd
[13:31:30] <duch_kazatel> the other one uses find behind the scenes.  but use .find() so you don't confuse people./
[13:31:50] <yjokhyijk> ahahhah so they are the same
[13:31:56] <yjokhyijk> it's just an hidden syntax
[13:31:57] <yjokhyijk> okay
[13:32:00] <duch_kazatel> no.
[13:32:06] <yjokhyijk> so?
[13:32:08] <duch_kazatel> the two I mentioned.
[13:32:12] <yjokhyijk> yo
[13:32:19] <yjokhyijk> $('#id').find('.class')
[13:32:22] <duch_kazatel> yes
[13:32:24] <yjokhyijk> $('.class', '#id')
[13:32:27] <yjokhyijk> those are the same
[13:32:28] <yjokhyijk> right?
[13:32:30] <duch_kazatel> okay, yeah.
[13:32:42] <yjokhyijk> thx, see you soon!
[13:32:44] <duch_kazatel> three separate syntaxes were given, just making sure we're clear :)
[13:32:49] <yjokhyijk> :D
[13:33:11] <decx> must be the first person not to be totally confused after being introduced to selector context
[13:33:23] <duch_kazatel> seriously.
[13:33:31] <Morl0ck> maybe he already knew and he was testing us
[13:33:37] <Morl0ck> o.Oa
[13:33:49] <duch_kazatel> or was like every other copy/paste developer.
[13:34:08] <duch_kazatel> "this nets the result i want, so i should use it."
[13:34:19] <Morl0ck> hahahaha sounds about right
[13:57:44] <Vooloo> I use bootstrap and run an .ajax post to an url, the post works fine etc. but how do I get feedback on success or error? I use the success: but I can't find a way to simply update the page with a green or red notice box
[13:58:12] <Vooloo> it's in a modal
[13:59:42] <Cork> Vooloo: what do you mean by feedback?
[14:00:34] <Vooloo> my php code throws an exception on error and sets $error message, if there is one I want to show it inside the modal in a red error box, the same way I do normal form POSTs. But I can't get any "return data" to the modal after using ajax posting
[14:01:22] <Cork> Vooloo: the the data you get is what is written in the page server side
[14:01:46] <Vooloo> alert(data) shows me the entire HTML code yeah
[14:02:02] <Cork> Vooloo: ya, that is what you can access
[14:02:07] <Vooloo> but how do I only get the error or success message and update inside the modal?
[14:02:12] <Cork> php variables isn't sent cross the net
[14:02:25] <NoiseEee> Vooloo: send back specific messages
[14:02:31] <oisjpae> guys i still have a problem
[14:02:32] <oisjpae> $(".chiudbox_dopoilclick").on('click', function() {
[14:02:37] <oisjpae> $('#podcastModal').find('.close').trigger('click');
[14:02:41] <oisjpae> });
[14:02:44] <Vooloo> I somehow need to create a javascript error box?
[14:02:50] <oisjpae> do you see any error? ^^
[14:02:51] <NoiseEee> Vooloo: .. catch(Exception $e) { $output['status'] = 'fail'; $output['msg'] = 'failed because bad things dude'}
[14:03:06] <Cork> Vooloo: you for example can send json instead of the html body
[14:03:13] <Cork> and have different variables in it
[14:03:13] <NoiseEee> Vooloo: echo json_encode($output); and then you can check the 'status' and 'msg' on the return
[14:03:37] <Cork> don't forget setting the content-type header if you do though
[14:04:02] <Vooloo> complicated >_<
[14:04:42] <Vooloo> I need to make my php code output both normal errors and in json format?
[14:04:57] <deepress> Hello, can anyone help me please with really easy animation, it appears to be bugged on safari browser :/
[14:05:14] <oisjpae> The function I pasted earlier  should  close  the  PODCAST  box once one of its links gets clicked  ----> http://bovore.altervista.org/nontoccare/
[14:05:22] <oisjpae> But it doesn't!!!
[14:05:58] <decx> til alta vista still exists
[14:06:03] <decx> wait a minute...
[14:07:15] <deepress> anyone please ? :/
[14:07:51] <BillCriswell> depress?
[14:08:11] <NoiseEee> deepress: the channel crystal ball isnt working today :(
[14:08:44] <deepress> ok ill try to explain
[14:08:55] <deepress> or i can send a link to the site so you can see for yourself
[14:09:22] <BillCriswell> deepress: Now that, my friend, might be useful.
[14:10:51] <deepress> http://53331.w31.wedos.ws/geryk/ if you scroll to the section with big paragraph and click to one of those rows with circle flat icon, the animation will destroy the flat icon somehow :/
[14:11:19] <deepress> it happens only on safari browser and i really can't figure how :/
[14:21:23] <Cork> deepress: you have code error preventing that code from working
[14:21:33] <Cork> (your using event that isn't defined)
[14:21:45] <deepress> where please ?
[14:22:39] <Cork> line 19
[14:22:47] <Cork> event.preventDefault; <--
[14:23:58] <deepress> ok removed but the ok circles are still being destroyed :/
[14:26:27] <Cork> deepress: it isn't destroyed in any browser
[14:26:48] <deepress> it is wait ill show you
[14:27:36] <Cork> deepress: i just tested in both chrome and firefox
[14:27:44] <deepress> https://www.dropbox.com/s/kpxz9141t5042mx/Screenshot%202014-03-10%2022.27.34.png
[14:27:46] <deepress> safari
[14:27:46] <Cork> and nothing happens to the circle
[14:28:00] <Cork> ah
[14:28:10] <Cork> you meant it happens not that it should happen
[14:28:42] <deepress> it should not happen
[14:28:52] <Cork> deepress: that looks like a rendering bug
[14:29:08] <deepress> yes that was my first thought too
[14:29:35] <deepress> it happens on iOS safari as well as on OS X safari version
[14:30:51] <Cork> deepress: you could try setting -webkit-transform: translate3d(0,0,0); on the checkboxes
[14:31:17] <deepress> ok ill try sec
[14:31:46] <deepress> PERFECT
[14:31:49] <deepress> that works !
[14:31:59] <Cork> lovely rendering bugs...
[14:32:13] <deepress> thank you very much !
[14:32:20] * velus is away: I'm busy
[14:32:25] <Cork> np
[14:39:54] <basiclaser> you guys have any ideas about making a picture look like a video in jquery? :) i have a picture of a pizza in an oven, i want to make it feel abit alive and gif-y
[14:40:29] <robert0> wut
[14:40:57] <duch_kazatel> you want CSS to do that,
[14:40:58] <duch_kazatel> i guess.
[14:41:39] <basiclaser> making website for friend who has a pizzeria, wanted to make an interesting 'living' backgrounf
[14:41:47] <duch_kazatel> define "living".
[14:41:47] <decx> first you learn how to canvas, then you duplicate your image, add some blur, some gaussian movement, add some moving lensflares and call it geocities 4.0
[14:41:54] <duch_kazatel> lmao
[14:41:55] <duch_kazatel> decx++
[14:41:58] <duch_kazatel> all day erry day
[14:42:08] <McLovin123> any idea why this simple 4 lines of jquery doesn't behave as intended?: http://pastie.org/8905560 It'll add in the "test1293" class, but NOT remove the expanded class?
[14:42:19] <Cork> actually svg might be the simplest way
[14:43:24] <decx> in all seriousness, if you are clever in your use of the alpha channel you can overlay and image with an fading in/out effectslayer
[14:43:28] <basiclaser> decx: that sounds pretty legit ^ ^
[14:43:28] <decx> an*
[14:44:15] <basiclaser> thanks alot decx i shall begin my research
[14:44:24] <Cork> McLovin123: that should work, though you can remove the extra selector
[14:44:43] <Cork> $(".expanded").addClass("test1293").removeClass("expanded");
[14:44:55] <duch_kazatel> McLovin123 http://jsfiddle.net/bfue2/
[14:45:07] <duch_kazatel> do what cork said, basically.
[14:45:15] <duch_kazatel> your HTML could be broken.
[14:45:31] <Cork> ?g w3c validate
[14:45:32] <b-ot> Cork: The W3C Markup Validation Service → http://validator.w3.org/
[14:46:09] <decx> Cork til about svg filters, how well does that work crossbrowser?
[14:46:29] <McLovin123> ok cheers will check it out... must be something else messing it up
[14:46:32] <Cork> decx: it works well except for a few bugs here and there
[14:46:55] <basiclaser> can canvas be reponsive?
[14:47:03] <Cork> bashusr: if you make it
[14:47:09] <decx> canvas can be anything you want it to be
[14:47:09] <basiclaser> lolz
[14:47:14] <basiclaser> thanks
[14:47:14] <Cork> but it doesn't do it automatically
[14:47:19] <basiclaser> ok
[14:47:31] <decx> unless you want to drawimage 1920x1080 on chrome at 60fps, then chrome will shit itself
[14:47:39] <Cork> basiclaser: canvas is basically a px image you draw what ever you like in
[14:47:51] <Cork> basiclaser: and nothing you don't do specifically happen
[14:48:15] <phelix> how do I go about grabbing the element of the first child class if I have the parent
[14:48:17] <basiclaser> i think mobile browser support is a big deal for this restaurant site, want it to just default to simple menu on mobile
[14:49:01] <Cork> phelix: that question doesn't make sense; please rephrase
[14:49:35] <phelix> I have the parent div.. <div class="the-parent"><div class="the-child"></div></div>
[14:49:41] <Cork> basiclaser: you could go the easy way and just make a gif out of the animation
[14:49:44] <decx> you can actually put a video in as the background basiclaser . if done tastefully (never happens) it can give a nice feel
[14:50:01] <phelix> how do I select the element of .the-child from grabbing the parent div?
[14:50:31] <grizly2> $('.parent-class > .child-class')...
[14:50:40] <Cork> phelix: $('.the-parent').find('.the-child')
[14:50:49] <Cork> where the first section would be the variable you had
[14:50:49] <decx> fullscreen gif is surprisingly unperformant
[14:50:54] <Cork> ya
[14:50:55] <phelix> what if I don't know the class of the child ?
[14:51:14] <Cork> phelix: is it the direct child?
[14:51:18] <phelix> yah
[14:51:20] <grizly2> you can use its type, id, etc
[14:51:20] <phelix> first one
[14:51:23] <Cork> .children.first()
[14:51:27] <Cork> opps
[14:51:32] <Cork> .children().first()
[14:51:45] <phelix> k let me try that thank you
[14:53:54] <Cork> basiclaser: something you should define before looking further, is what browser you need to support
[14:54:14] <Cork> basiclaser: cause that will limit your options fast
[14:55:19] <Cork> canvas is very limited support if you want slightly older ie support (ie9+)
[14:55:29] <Cork> same for <video>
[14:55:37] <andrew9183> theres excanvas
[14:55:40] <andrew9183> but never looked into it
[14:55:45] <Cork> svg is same, but older ie supports vml
[14:55:52] <phelix> http://jsfiddle.net/BwgYV/
[14:55:54] <Cork> andrew9183: that is emulated in vml
[14:55:58] <andrew9183> ah
[14:56:08] <andrew9183> i did a huge canvas project for ie9+
[14:56:10] <phelix> I can't seem to get this working properly.. if someone could take a look at this for me that would be awesome.
[14:56:23] <Genitrust> what is the event called when someone selects an option from a dropdown combobox ?
[14:56:29] <Cork> andrew9183: it kinda shows how much of canvas svg can do :)
[14:56:58] <Cork> Genitrust: click, or change
[14:57:28] <Genitrust> ah yes, change... thanks Cork! :)
[14:57:42] <Cork> Genitrust: not though if they select the same option, it won't fire
[14:57:48] <Cork> *note
[14:57:56] <Genitrust> ahhh
[14:58:19] <Cork> if you want that to work you need click (and might want to bind keyup for keyboard navigation)
[14:58:50] <phelix> http://jsfiddle.net/BwgYV/1/ there we go the html is formatted easier to read.
[15:00:16] <decx> what are you trying to do?
[15:00:44] <phelix> When you mouseover a div that has the class has-item I want to remove the class show-me from the child
[15:01:30] <phelix> trying to create a mouseover on hover that displays the hidden menu if it exists. So I have code that sets up the classes depending on if there are items under it. If that makes any sense.
[15:01:41] <Cork> phelix: you most likely want mouseenter note hover
[15:01:47] <phelix> so trying to use jquery to show this div on mouseover
[15:01:52] <phelix> ohh ok
[15:01:59] <Cork> phelix: cause if you move onto a child element hover will take it as out
[15:02:13] <Cork> mouseenter + mouseleave
[15:02:16] <phelix> ahh ok. I'll have to update that.
[15:02:28] <phelix> But.. I still can't figure out how to get that child element and remove the .show-me class from it
[15:02:44] <Cork> phelix: hover takes two callbacks
[15:02:55] <Cork> or you can use .mouseleave like i said
[15:02:58] <phelix> and then when you mouseleave i want it to add back the class
[15:03:04] <phelix> yes I want to do it how you were talking about
[15:03:08] <phelix> with mouseenter and mouseleave
[15:03:25] <phelix> so on mouseenter it should remove .show-me clas and on mouseleave it should add it back
[15:03:37] <decx> but why are you separating your menu logic like that?
[15:03:53] <phelix> I am not sure. Just how I thought about doing this
[15:05:44] <decx> i ask because there's no semantic relation between items and their submenus
[15:06:34] <phelix> There is. If the item has a submenu it ads the class has-stuff to its parent and show-me on the child class is added which by default is display:none;l
[15:08:15] <phelix> So I just need to figure out how to remove the .show-me class from the child on mouseenter on th ehas-stuff element
[15:08:17] <decx> so alteration has a submenu with entertainment, floral, food, and entertainment has bowling concerts and lampworking
[15:08:39] <phelix> yes
[15:08:53] <decx> it's more common to put the submenu as a sibiling to your link
[15:08:54] <phelix> only entertainment has a sub menu
[15:09:27] <decx> <ul><li><a>link</a><ul class="submenu"><li><a....
[15:09:30] <phelix> hmm, not quite sure how to do it that way. Won't whatI am trying to do work though?
[15:09:36] <Genitrust> hmm, does jquery have  something you can 'attach' to a text form field that will only allow certain keyboard keys to be pressed into that field?
[15:09:37] <phelix> ahh yes with ul and li
[15:10:00] <phelix> But I will still be in the same boat. I need to hide and unhide this depending on mouseenter or mouseleave
[15:10:17] <decx> now when somebody hovers the li, you can do something like ul li:hover ul { display: block } in css
[15:10:17] <phelix> I can change the format to ul and li later
[15:10:29] <phelix> ohh
[15:11:06] <Genitrust> really? :( jquery doesn't have this? :(
[15:11:37] <decx> that's a bit fiddly but it's no problem Genitrust
[15:11:57] <Genitrust> decx, thx, do you know what the jquery item is called to do that?
[15:11:59] <decx> the keydown event will allow you the block or allow specific keyCodes
[15:12:05] <Genitrust> as in, what do i want to research?
[15:13:42] <Genitrust> decx oooh, what do you do if you find a certain key? e.preventDefault ?
[15:15:10] <decx> when in doubt, return false ;)
[15:15:16] <Genitrust> hah :)
[15:15:29] <Cork> decx: actually no
[15:15:44] <Cork> return false often does the wrong thing
[15:16:12] <decx> i know that much, but the specifics yet elude me
[15:16:32] <Cork> decx: return false kills all event handlers
[15:16:48] <Cork> and that means unobstructive script extending of the page is impossible
[15:17:12] <Cork> cause you have to modify every place that does return false;
[15:17:21] <Cork> to include an exception for the case you want to handle
[15:17:31] <decx> that makes sense! thanks
[15:17:36] <Cork> that VERY fast becomes a real mess
[15:19:26] <phelix> decx: http://jsfiddle.net/BwgYV/5/
[15:19:36] <phelix> I have it in the format you were talking about now
[15:20:09] <decx> the sub ul goes into the li
[15:20:23] <phelix> ohh inside the li tag?
[15:20:27] <decx> otherwise you're breaking the validity of the ul
[15:20:33] <phelix>  ok thats right
[15:20:38] <decx> as it can only have li children
[15:22:47] <phelix> http://jsfiddle.net/BwgYV/6/ there we go
[15:22:52] <phelix> think I got it correct
[15:23:25] <phelix> er maybe not
[15:24:07] <decx> now you have two options, if you want to target ie6, you have to rely on javascript. if you don't care about that you can do it with css
[15:24:07] <phelix> wait.. I think that is correct
[15:24:29] <phelix> Yeah I could care less about IE6 I only support IE10+ and FF / Chrome
[15:25:03] <jwwwww> Hello.
[15:26:10] <jwwwww> I have some troubles when using datatable with jeditable. I need to click twice to get the options, once to select the cell and one to get the options.is there a way to have this done in one click ? I'm looking for hours.
[15:26:31] <decx> phelix http://jsfiddle.net/decx/BwgYV/7/ but i don't advise to slide it down on hover, it's distracting
[15:26:56] <jwwwww> btw it's when I use input type select.
[15:28:35] <phelix> decx: Ahh, ok IC.. perfect thank you
[15:30:32] <decx> phelix i prefer the flyout style http://jsfiddle.net/decx/BwgYV/8/
[15:31:17] <fiveofoh> phelix, decx: also consider http://cherne.net/brian/resources/jquery.hoverIntent.html as an option
[15:31:53] <decx> fiveofoh i like https://rawgithub.com/kamens/jQuery-menu-aim/master/example/example.html too
[15:32:22] <decx> oh i meant https://github.com/kamens/jQuery-menu-aim
[15:32:27] <decx> same thing ^^
[15:33:13] <fiveofoh> Altho I didn't realize at first the initial version was solely CSS.  If that's important, then yeah, flyout is nice
[15:47:03] <kippi> hey
[15:47:35] <kippi> I am using .html to load a html page into another html page, the issue is the css isn't loading to the html that is loaded in
[15:48:12] <kippi> is I copy and paste the html I am loading it works fine, however if i use .html it looks incorrect
[15:58:41] <phelix> decx: http://i.imgur.com/b0QcWIc.png
[15:59:00] <phelix> this is thte effect I am trying to get on this mouseover. Is that something that will need to be done with javascript? or jquery?
[15:59:40] <phelix> I can get this to work with CSS but using position:absolute; but it then changes the hover location on all the other items also and since its dynamically generated not sure using that method will work
[16:05:26] <decx> phelix that will work with css only no problem, but of course you can use js to flavour it up a bit
[16:06:57] <decx> kippi the css will apply to the new elements, there might be something wrong with your loading
[16:09:07] <phelix> decx: do I just need position:relative on the li where this is to popup and then a position:absolute on the popup box? so that it sits in the right location everywhere it is displayed?
[16:15:22] <iSDP> how can i select stuff inside a iframe?
[16:15:53] <duch_kazatel> iSDP are you on the same domain and the iframe?
[16:15:55] <iSDP> i already used $("#iframe").contents().find("#idinsideiframe"), but that results in undefined data
[16:15:58] <iSDP> nope
[16:16:09] <duch_kazatel> that might not work, then.
[16:16:14] <iSDP> how so?
[16:16:17] <duch_kazatel> same-domain policy
[16:16:39] <duch_kazatel> https://api.jquery.com/contents/ - "The .contents() method can also be used to get the content document of an iframe, if the iframe is on the same domain as the main page."
[16:17:13] <Genitrust> hmm, is there a way to hook into another library's jquery validation?
[16:17:21] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[16:17:42] <Genitrust> i'm getting this problem from a bootstrap plugin... and of course, ya, ...
[16:17:42] <Genitrust> http://imgur.com/VGxiNPT
[16:18:08] <Genitrust> my fields are hidden for aesthetic reasons
[16:18:23] <Genitrust> but it would be good to find out which items were considered invalid so i can display that div
[16:18:51] <Genitrust> if i knew how to check the fields automatically (before form submit), i would do that
[16:19:26] <iSDP> duch_kazatel, any way to bypass all that?
[16:19:45] <Genitrust> w00t, i just found an answer: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18220340/validate-fields-using-jquery-validation-without-any-submit
[16:20:43] <decx> ye i used that before, didnt make any problems
[16:20:45] <duch_kazatel> iSDP sure - proxy the page request through your server
[16:21:12] <duch_kazatel> iSDP same-domain policy is restrictive for a reason.
[16:21:25] <iSDP> duch_kazatel, i want to manipulate a form on another website
[16:21:39] <duch_kazatel> iSDP that's not going to work through an iframe.
[16:21:47] <iSDP> hm.
[16:22:16] <duch_kazatel> let's back up and ask the question: why are you doing that?
[16:23:40] <iSDP> good question, i'm trying to restyle a form and change it around a bit
[16:23:50] <duch_kazatel> on another site?
[16:24:02] <duch_kazatel> let's go another step - why?
[16:24:03] <duch_kazatel> :)
[16:24:12] <iSDP> yeah, some sort of intermediary portal
[16:24:33] <iSDP> just trying to make the form easier to fill in
[16:24:45] <duch_kazatel> why not make a browser plugin to do it instead?
[16:24:53] <duch_kazatel> instead of going through an iframe?
[16:25:13] <iSDP> because i don't know/want to make a plugin
[16:25:23] <duch_kazatel> well then.
[16:25:27] <iSDP> and i do know jQuery
[16:25:47] <duch_kazatel> you can use jquery in your plugin.
[16:27:28] <tracker1> duch_kazatel, you could write your own form that submits to the original end point.
[16:27:39] <duch_kazatel> tracker1 I'm not the one with the problem.
[16:27:42] <tracker1> of course, this may have other issues.
[16:27:44] <duch_kazatel> also, not every site would allow that.
[16:27:49] <duch_kazatel> but yeah, that's on idea.
[16:27:50] <tracker1> sorry, iSDP
[16:28:30] <iSDP> and reading values from that website, then posting back to the original page where it has to be posted?
[16:28:45] <duch_kazatel> whatever the action is set to
[16:28:52] <iSDP> POST
[16:29:09] <duch_kazatel> the action, not method
[16:29:38] <iSDP> but how can i read data from that page then?
[16:29:41] <tracker1> iSDP, yes... though if they have CSRF tokens, then that may not work.
[16:29:53] <duch_kazatel> iSDP what data would you need to read?
[16:30:07] <iSDP> there's a hidden value containing the post id
[16:30:08] <duch_kazatel> because what we're suggesting would only work with a static copy of the form.
[16:30:09] <tracker1> your server downloads the page for the user.. then renders a form to your user.. when they click submit, it POSTs to the original site
[16:30:37] <duch_kazatel> tracker1 they didn't want to deal with server-side.
[16:30:41] <tracker1> iSDP, it really depends... most stuff in the browser is meant to prevent what you're doing.
[16:30:44] <KWhat4> Anyone with lightbox2 experience know how to make it manually refresh?  Or does anyone know of a better lightbox2 alternative that someone actually wrote some documentation for?
[16:30:54] <tracker1> duch_kazatel, gotcha..
[16:31:18] <iSDP> i don't mind posting to the endpoint
[16:31:32] <iSDP> but i'd like to do this purely with jQuery
[16:31:32] <tracker1> iSDP, do you control the clients/browser (IE is it just users in your company usign this)
[16:31:43] <iSDP> it's only me using this
[16:32:06] <tracker1> iSDP, look into greasemonkey/user scripts for firefox or chrome.
[16:32:19] <tracker1> you can force in jQuery, and use it if not already available..
[16:32:24] <iSDP> i want to do this on a webpage :(
[16:32:40] <tracker1> iSDP, yeah, you can tell your script to run on certain pages
[16:33:01] <tracker1> iSDP, it's still javascript, you can still use jquery.
[16:33:01] <iSDP> no not that, i want to download the html and extract the values...
[16:33:31] <Genitrust> does anyone here use django-bootstrap ? ...and know how to manually check if a form field is valid before form submission?
[16:34:00] <tracker1> iSDP, if you're more comfortable with JavaScript, you can probably do something with Phantom.js or node.js to do what you want.
[16:34:47] <duch_kazatel> iSDP you need to use node with phantom to do what you want at this point.
[16:35:06] <duch_kazatel> or some other server-side technology.
[16:35:20] <duch_kazatel> or write a browser plugin to handle this for you.
[16:35:34] <tracker1> iSDP, what duch_kazatel said ... your best bet (if you want to use JS) would be node+phantom, which is relatively straight forward.
[16:36:07] <iSDP> okidokie
[16:36:12] <tracker1> for the record, I freaking love node.js for a lot of stuff like this.
[16:37:36] <Asphyxiant> what in the world is e3?
[16:37:54] <duch_kazatel> Asphyxiant have any context?
[16:38:04] <Asphyxiant> slideshowSpeed:7e3;
[16:38:39] <Asphyxiant> it seems like it's about 7 seconds, I just don't get the e3 part.
[16:38:57] <Asphyxiant> All of the other values are follow by 0's, i.e. 400 2000 6000
[16:39:11] <Asphyxiant> and then there's just this random 7e3
[16:39:43] <decx> some ridiculous math.pow shorthand?
[16:39:57] <duch_kazatel> yeah without seeing the plugin source it's hard to know.
[16:41:35] <tracker1> Asphyxiant, iirc short for 7*(10^3)
[16:42:46] <duch_kazatel> woah.
[16:42:49] <duch_kazatel> he's right.
[16:42:52] <duch_kazatel> >>
[16:43:01] <duch_kazatel> awww no bot :(
[16:43:31] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/CWX5E/
[16:44:32] <decx> not exactly pow but the ridiculous shorthand part was right
[16:44:39] <decx> neato
[16:45:03] <tracker1> I'd sacrifice the 1 extra character
[16:45:35] <Asphyxiant> e for exponent
[16:45:35] <duch_kazatel> yeah same here.
[16:45:38] <Asphyxiant> lmfao fml
[16:45:49] <Asphyxiant> tracker1: thanks a lot man that drove me up the wall.
[16:46:01] <tracker1> Asphyxiant, np
[16:46:24] <decx> thanks for bringing it up, that means i learned my one new thing for today and can rest the next 23 hours and 15 minutes
[16:46:47] <duch_kazatel> yaaaaaaaaay
[17:08:21] <jwmann> I'm animating opacity and scale using jquery Transit and my parent element has an rgba value of (0,0,0,0.7), for some reason, when it animates, the parent element looks like rgba(0,0,0,0.9) during the animation and then goes back to what it's supposed to after it completes the animation.
[17:08:39] <jwmann> This doesn't happen if I use a transparent png as a background for the parent element
[17:09:09] <jwmann> This effect doesn't happen in Firefox, only in Chrome for some reason (works fine, albeit slow, in Firefox)
[17:09:32] <jwmann> Would anybody have any clue on how the heck I would troubleshoot this? :S
[17:10:34] <duch_kazatel> can you setup a fiddle to demonstrate?
[17:15:35] <jwmann> Ummm
[17:16:13] <jwmann> The best way I can think of is to provide you access to my staging website
[17:16:28] <jwmann> Is okay if I PM you this information?
[17:16:31] <duch_kazatel> no thanks.
[17:16:38] <duch_kazatel> i get real uncomfortable in those cases.
[17:16:43] <jwmann> Oki doki then
[17:17:43] <jwmann> duch_kazatel: Perhaps I can create a jsFiddle. Let me try.
[17:17:45] <duch_kazatel> either way, i'd end up trawling through the transit docs.
[17:25:06] <KWhat4> Anyone know of a lightbox alternative that A) Works, B) has docs and C) can be called manually ?
[17:25:31] <duch_kazatel> i use jqmodal, not sure if that's the same.
[17:26:09] <KWhat4> duch_kazatel: which one there are several by that name
[17:26:35] <duch_kazatel> https://github.com/eyoosuf/jqModal
[17:26:45] <duch_kazatel> docs at http://jquery.iceburg.net/jqModal/
[17:28:36] <mikeche1en> i have a text input field and search button inline with jquery mobile, but they are different heights, how should i fix this?
[17:28:59] <duch_kazatel> css
[17:30:08] <mikeche1en> im not sure where the css that is causing the problem is coming from
[17:34:33] <mikeche1en> i set an identical height on ui-btn and ui-input-text classes but i guess there is some other spacing or padding issue
[17:37:38] <mikeche1en> haha i could adjust the pixel sizes of each until they look equivalent :P
[17:56:44] <jwmann> Oh no duch_kazatel is gone :(
[17:56:57] <jwmann> Anyway, I built a jsFiddle - http://jsfiddle.net/tJYSw/1/
[17:57:11] <jwmann> Not sure why this effect happens. Only happens in Chrome.

[20:40:53] <ISmithers> To add a new HTML element, say a list item to an unordered list, I can use $( ".list" ).append( "<li>New Item</li>" ); but what if the item name is from a variable?
[20:41:57] <ISmithers> Do I need to construct that string parameter prior to using it in the append function call? So: var param = "<li>" + k + "</li>";  where k holds a string value which I'm using as the name, and then pass it through to the function call?
[20:57:29] <snufft_laptop> hey guys!

[21:06:05] <Takyoji[laptop]> But not sure if there's anything special needed, to bring focus back to the body or anything, when a navigation element is selected, or similar.
[22:22:25] <sha0> Hello, all.  When I attached an event-listener to a class of elements, if I create a new element with that class, do I have to re-attach?
[22:22:38] <sha0> Er, first "attached" should've been "attach"
[22:23:26] <sha0> That is to ask: Does jQuery attach these event-listeners by iterating through each element with the class and attaching the event-listener, in a one-time shot?

[23:18:56] <bgsmith> greetings channel, returning a value from a callback - I get an empty array, having a problem with variable scope - http://pastie.org/8906314
[23:19:40] <velus> ok will do and sorry i crashed a sec
[23:20:42] <velus> still the ame thing
[23:22:07] <velus> Uhkis: its still going to /post and not to /ap/api/login.php
[23:23:29] <_cristian_> bgsmith because that is async, you should return that with a callback.
[23:24:42] <bgsmith> cristian, so instead of returning a variable, I should pass in a function as a callback to getDeviceList ?
[23:25:47] <_cristian_> bgsmith, yes let me give you an example.
[23:25:49] <bgsmith> I just want to get an array from a function and iterate over it, passing the ids I get to another function that will get details related to the IDs and populate the page
[23:26:17] <Uhkis> velus: removing the action="" attribute should work :-D
[23:26:38] <bgsmith> (newbie coming from C/Perl background and can't get the hang of async/javascript yet)
[23:26:47] <velus> for got about that lol

[23:28:07] <_cristian_> bgsmith http://pastie.org/8906331
[23:28:25] <velus> Uhkis: do i need the method="post"?
[23:29:44] <Uhkis> doubt it
