[13:26:31] <ckb> Okay guys. Need some help. I’m trying to use jquery to “fix” an element to the bottom of the screen after a certain scroll point. I don’t want to use position: fixed, as it messes my widths up. Any advice? (I have a scrollable element positioned absolute: top: 75px; bottom: 0px that I’m working with.
[13:47:49] <davenull> hey guys, I have a problem when using $.ajax with $_POST method. Apparently when the size of my data object increases above a certain threshold, I get a 404 response from the server. I can't figure out why. The max_post_size is set to 8M (which is sufficient).

[14:29:46] <francuz> hello everyone, i'm using the datatables jQuery plug-in, and i'm triing to remove the "Show 'select dropdown menu' entries" thingy, (but still have pagination, just with a define number of elements per page)
[14:30:12] <francuz> I'm looking through the documentation and i cannot find it, would be strange that they don't have the option,
[14:36:20] <marquezini> need some help in my first js code, one good soul can helpme to troubleshoot this code ?! https://pastebin.com/wJDW2ZCc
[14:44:35] <pavonia> marquezini: What's the problem with this?
[14:46:01] <marquezini> i learning js, i have some problem on js, i think the html dont call the js when a button is clicked, or i dont use the certain jquery function
[14:46:21] <marquezini> now i reading tutos to learn js
[14:59:03] <pavonia> marquezini: Not sure why onclick doesn't work there, but you could use JQuery to bind the click handlers: https://jsfiddle.net/5zjmnho6/
[15:04:40] <randohinn> o/
[15:05:08] <marquezini> tk pavonia
[15:05:52] <randohinn> I was wondering - remove can take in selectors, but can it also remove by html, eq- if I add via .append and then want to remove the added element, whitout knowing what classes it may or may not have
[15:14:39] <francuz> hello, i'm using datatables (datatables.net) for my tables and i'd like to know how can i use my own search box instead of theirs ? (their search function, i just want the searchbox to be somewhere else and look totally different)
[15:14:57] <francuz> anyone already tried to do something like this ?
[15:20:35] <sigdk> same code runs ok locally, with a bug on a different system, any hint: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/30c56c335b9dbbe91dc099bb4c23f0e3   ?
[15:33:11] <marquezini> pavonia, https://pastebin.com/5xEVdbp5
[15:46:32] <pavonia> marquezini: Does that work? I think it should be just  $("#butAnterior").on("click", butAnterior_OnClick);
[15:48:20] <marquezini> dont work
[15:48:28] <marquezini> i put tag onclick inside <input> and work well
[15:49:20] <marquezini> the function $().on call the event when just called, not when trigged by onclick
[15:49:20] <marquezini> tks
[15:50:44] <pavonia> No, the registering is executed immediately but the event handler will only be called if the button is clicked
