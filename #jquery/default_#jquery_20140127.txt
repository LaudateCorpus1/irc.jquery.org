[00:07:25] <spygame> hey guys, i'm using jquery datetimepicker and i wanna show the time slots as checkboxes in the UI, any ideas how to implement that ?
[00:14:44] <zeropx> In example $('.targetedClassName').foo();. Is there a way to get the targeted value IE the .targetedClassName in this case from within the function? Instead of $(this), i'd like to get the actual targeted value
[00:15:09] <Cork> zeropx: if your using pre 1.9 yes
[00:15:24] <zeropx> Cork: cool, how?
[00:15:37] <Cork> .selector
[00:15:44] <zeropx> probably not best practice, but don't have option to rewrite
[00:15:54] <Cork> it is removed in 1.9 though
[00:16:00] <Cork> cause it was only needed for .live
[00:16:44] <zeropx> Cork: I see.
[00:16:44] <Cork> though for later versions you could wrap $() and create the variable again
[00:17:10] <zeropx> I think that will be the quick route for now, just going to global the selector value
[00:20:45] <zeropx> Cork: thanks.
[00:58:45] <fabioportieri> morning
[01:18:19] <spygame> hey ppl, would appreciate some feedback http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21375882/how-to-use-jquery-datetimepicker-to-show-time-in-30-min-interval-as-checkboxes
[01:43:45] <joroci> hi, in jquery mouseleave event there is a toElement property and it's giving me the a div wrapper
[01:44:02] <joroci> i want it to give me a target inside that div, is that possible?
[01:48:49] <fabioportieri> joroci: isn't it the element in which the user points when leaving the mouse? so how can you control it?
[01:49:28] <joroci> yea but he's pointing at the element i'm expecting to get
[01:49:33] <joroci> but i'm getting that element parent
[01:49:43] <joroci> i mean i'm poingint
[01:49:47] <joroci> pointing
[01:49:58] <fabioportieri> it points to the wrapper?
[01:50:03] <fabioportieri> mm
[01:50:16] <fabioportieri> try to put the inner as wide as the parent?
[01:50:28] <joroci> it's a list of li's
[01:50:43] <fabioportieri> each li has a proper dimension?
[01:51:02] <Cork> joroci: i don't think toElement is normally supported
[01:51:13] <joroci> that or relatedTarget
[01:51:27] <Cork> joroci: though relatedTarget should give you what you want ya
[01:51:42] <joroci> i hoped so, but it's giving the same value :|
[01:51:44] <Cork> but as the event is fired when the mouseout event fires
[01:51:54] <Cork> you can only get the first element you hit after you leave
[01:52:09] <Cork> then you would have to bind listener on the wrapper
[01:52:10] <joroci> yea i'm expecting to get a specific element
[01:52:36] <joroci> which i move my mouse to , but not getting it
[01:52:58] <joroci> and yea the element has proper height and width
[01:53:03] <Cork> is there any elements inbetween?
[01:53:18] <mathankumarc> hi There
[01:53:18] <mathankumarc> Getting flickering effect whe chaning height of an element using jquery in ios 6?
[01:53:18] <mathankumarc> When I used harware accelaration(i.e applying css3 transform, backface visibilty to bodyt), the page became too slow.
[01:53:18] <mathankumarc> is there any workaround available in jquery.
[01:53:25] <joroci> no just ul with list items
[01:53:28] <Cork> actually the dom structure you have would help
[01:54:35] <Cork> mathankumarc: you most likely can't make things speedier from js then transform can do
[01:54:35] <joroci> i have in my page some elements with a class, when i hover them a tooltip will show, i'm adding that tooltip to the body
[01:55:05] <joroci> for example i hover an image and the tooltip will show and i go back to the image
[01:55:36] <joroci> instead of getting the image or event it's parent i get the parent of list item containing the image
[01:56:10] <Cork> it is most likely related to how things are structured
[01:56:32] <joroci> hmm
[01:56:40] <joroci> sec
[01:56:52] <mathankumarc> @Cork yep thatś true, is it possible to remove that flickering effect using animate or some different way to resize the container height?
[01:57:16] <Cork> mathankumarc: most likely not
[01:57:32] <Cork> mathankumarc: as the flickering is most likely cause of rendering problems in the browser
[01:58:24] <Cork> mathankumarc: your solusion is most likely in css
[01:58:32] <Cork> trying to figure out what css rules cause the bug
[01:58:37] <mathankumarc> Cork: may be, cause we´re not getting that flickering effect in ios7, we getting in ios 6 alone
[01:58:43] <Cork> and try to find a rule set that works around it
[01:59:10] <Cork> mathankumarc: well that is logical as they hopefully fix bugs in later versions
[02:00:08] <mathankumarc> Cork: Do you think any specific CSS change can help us? not sure on whcih one to change. any thought?
[02:00:22] <Cork> mathankumarc: most likely yes
[02:00:26] <Cork> but no i don't have it for you
[02:00:38] <Cork> mobile css rendering is buggy, expecially ios
[02:00:53] <Cork> so you normally need to write workarounds for things
[02:01:11] <Cork> reducing the test to find what causes it is the first step you need to take though
[02:01:51] <mathankumarc> found which line casues that one
[02:01:56] <mathankumarc> this is the culprit - contentSlider.height(contentSlider.slides.eq(contentSlider.animatingTo).height());
[02:02:53] <Cork> well check the values
[02:03:01] <Cork> but ya most likely it is just a reflow issue
[02:03:02] <mathankumarc> sure
[02:03:14] <mathankumarc> reflow?
[02:03:36] <Cork> then you grab height the browser reflows the dom to calculate the dimentions of the different elements
[02:03:55] <Cork> mathankumarc: but i didn't mean to look at js
[02:04:10] <Cork> i would suspect you can reproduce it with almost no js
[02:04:33] <Cork> and the problem is a needed css property to get the browser to behave
[02:05:00] <mathankumarc> oh, initially i thought it must be a jquery issue with ios
[02:05:07] <Cork> most likely not
[02:05:08] <mathankumarc> will explore on the workarounds. there would be some way to fix this :)
[02:05:34] <Cork> jquery (and js in general) just modifies the style attribute
[02:05:52] <mathankumarc> yes
[02:05:55] <Cork> so unless it calculates values wrong, the problem is rendering bugs in the browser
[02:06:06] <Cork> and the later is much more common then the first
[02:06:48] <fabioportieri> i heard animations are buggy on mobile...
[02:07:05] <mathankumarc> so I need to start learn more about rendering engines too
[02:07:07] <fabioportieri> with pure css
[02:07:11] <mathankumarc> lot of buggy :)
[02:07:23] <fabioportieri> or just don't use them on mobile...
[02:07:29] <Cork> well it is more that css is buggy on mobile
[02:07:44] <Cork> so any change to css can cause the page to blow up
[02:08:02] <Cork> now days there is two exceptions though
[02:08:12] <Cork> modern chrome and firefox mobile works ok
[02:08:27] <Cork> but ios is still horriby broken
[02:08:35] <Cork> (and android native browser)
[02:09:28] <mathankumarc> ios is always standing different :)
[02:09:49] <Cork> well native android browser is about as bad
[02:10:01] <Cork> but ya, at least you have a choice on android
[02:11:01] <mathankumarc> heard that ios chrome app is using different arch than android & desktop versions
[02:11:31] <Cork> as none apple rendering engine is forbidden
[02:11:32] <Cork> ya
[02:12:09] <Cork> chrome on ios is basically safari theme -jit support
[02:12:35] <Cork> as applications other then safari isn't permitted to use the js jit engine
[02:13:42] <mathankumarc> I think thatś why firebox is not providing support for ios. Am I right?
[02:13:52] <Cork> they can't
[02:14:06] <Cork> as they would have to rewrite the entire browser to use webkit
[02:14:12] <Cork> and that is not doable
[02:14:18] <mathankumarc> weired
[02:14:27] <Cork> just look at opera
[02:14:37] <Cork> that is basically what firefox would have to do
[02:15:02] <Cork> *throw everything out and create a theme for chrome*
[02:15:52] <mathankumarc> :)
[02:16:40] <mathankumarc> leant a lot of new things from you. Thanks a lot Cork :)
[02:16:49] <Cork> yw :)
[03:02:39] <techouse> is there any datepicker option to trigger an action each time the user clicks the arrows to change months?
[03:03:10] <techouse> say it's on jan 14 now and when the user clicks next to go to feb 14 I want it to fire an ajax
[03:03:21] <techouse> any in-built methods?
[03:03:54] <donmatthew> techouse: are you using jQuery UI datepicker?
[03:04:07] <techouse> yes
[03:04:13] <Cork> http://api.jqueryui.com/datepicker/#option-changeMonth
[03:05:00] <Cork> hmm doesn't look like it
[03:05:01] <techouse> Cork: not what i'm looking for
[03:05:04] <Cork> ya
[03:05:12] <techouse> i wanna hook a function to it
[03:05:18] <techouse> not set it to true/false
[03:06:36] <Cork> it doesn't seam to provide many callbacks at all actually
[03:07:29] <Cork> techouse: http://api.jqueryui.com/datepicker/#option-onChangeMonthYear MIGHT work
[03:10:18] <techouse> Cork, tx!

[03:17:29] <Guest29123> spam?
[03:17:30] <Cork> what part of this is related to jquery?

[03:47:00] <morfin> hello
[03:47:12] <morfin> is there a way to $.parseJSON without resorting whole array?
[03:47:38] <morfin> i am getting subarrays resorted by key(but i do not really need that
[04:00:41] <dwarder> how is the command called to call chrome's debugger?
[04:00:44] <dwarder> debug;
[04:00:50] <dwarder> in the js code
[04:19:53] <Whiskey> My jQuery code not work as i espect i to, so my question is if this is correct "$("img").css("max-width:" {infoViewWidth - 20}")";"
[04:22:17] <cannap> $("img").css({"max-width" : infoViewWidth - 20});
[04:22:49] <cannap> what for editor you using?
[04:22:56] <Whiskey> yeh so it is correct espect the " in start and end
[04:22:58] <Whiskey> as i add them
[04:23:28] <Whiskey> well it was some other changes i use rclipse
[04:23:32] <Whiskey> "eclipse"
[04:23:56] <cannap> the show if the code is correct
[04:25:14] <Whiskey> See if i can make a full testcase as i can´t get it work as i will
[04:34:59] <seutje> Whiskey: eclipse doesn't mark this as a syntax error? -> "max-width:" {infoViewWidth - 20}")"
[04:35:33] <seutje> it's like string malformed object string, no operators or anything
[04:36:23] <SillyTalker> how can i reload the dom before a page loads?
[04:36:49] <SillyTalker> i don't need nor want this feature and there does not seem to be a decent way to get rid of it
[04:37:01] <SillyTalker> i'm uising jquery mobile in case it matters
[04:37:08] <fabioportieri> what's dart ?
[04:47:26] <seutje> SillyTalker: why would u want that?
[04:47:39] <Whiskey> naaa i run it little special thats why
[04:49:15] <Whiskey> anyways: http://jsfiddle.net/Slaktarn/crLyf/1/ this my test case
[04:51:11] <Whiskey> http://jsfiddle.net/Slaktarn/C8764/1/ lol
[04:53:24] <Whiskey> see what chrome says
[04:55:26] <Whiskey> hm it won´t find the ccode that way :/
[05:03:46] <Whiskey> if i set a variable in a function, can i not access it in another?
[05:05:48] <seutje> Whiskey: if it's only defined within the scope of that function and not exposed, nope
[05:06:47] <Whiskey> how tomake it global?
[05:07:09] <Whiskey> i guss that "global var" wont work :D
[05:07:57] <seutje> window.foo = foo; is a common pattern to leak a variable to the global scope
[05:08:08] <seutje> do note that window is only available in a browser context
[05:08:17] <Whiskey> whatever that means
[05:08:56] <seutje> ppl often (function(scope) {  /* use scope.foo instead of window.foo and it'll still work in the Nodes and whatnot *?  })(this);
[05:09:07] <seutje> s/*?/*/
[05:09:24] <Whiskey> complicatd stuff
[05:09:25] <seutje> might wanna decide on a namespace for ur app though
[05:09:56] <seutje> so window.whiskeysFancyPants is a collection of all the variables you need to expose globally
[05:10:02] <Whiskey> works perfect
[05:10:11] <seutje> window.whiskeysFancyPants.foo, etc
[05:10:31] <seutje> otherwise you might end up with 17 components trying to define window.foo
[05:11:09] <Whiskey> im afraid im not fallow
[05:11:24] <Whiskey> but that you not easy just can import a variable from another function is stupid
[05:11:38] <Whiskey> but that maybe you can else there when i think after
[05:11:43] <seutje> only if you define it in a stupid way
[05:11:55] <seutje> if you don't expose it, it isn't exposed
[05:12:01] <seutje> this doesn't seem like a gigantic leap
[05:12:33] <Whiskey> well its logic no reason to have 100 of vars outside a scope if its not needed
[05:12:48] <seutje> frankly, you can just var Foo = function() { this.lol = 'lol'; }; var foo = new Foo(); alert(foo.lol);
[05:12:52] <seutje> functions are objects
[05:13:06] <Whiskey> think i stick to that window
[05:13:08] <Whiskey> it worked fine
[05:13:08] <seutje> u asked me how to put it in a global scope
[05:13:19] <seutje> it's the poorest way to do thing, but that's all u asked
[05:13:37] <Whiskey> well i have a function that set a value the the variable
[05:13:48] <Whiskey> and then maybe another a function need this value when its executed
[05:13:49] <seutje> should be creating a system where components don't need eachother's info, or provide getters/setters for them
[05:14:04] <seutje> so you can act upon changes without having to spaghetti the whole application
[05:14:08] <Whiskey> my skills in javascript is to poor
[05:15:33] <Whiskey> seutje: http://jsfiddle.net/C8764/3/ search after "window.infoViewWidth"
[05:15:53] <Whiskey> then resizeImage() use it
[05:21:04] <Whiskey> atlest it worked
[05:26:03] <Whiskey> seutje: did you check the code, just notice that it won´t work in all cases for me
[05:34:16] <seutje> Whiskey: why 2 document.readys?
[05:34:53] <seutje> these function names are intentionally obfuscated?
[05:38:25] <Whiskey> its not always loaded
[05:38:26] <Whiskey> both
[05:39:42] <seutje> what?
[05:47:37] <jwg2s> This may be really stupid, but I have a hash like this in javascript: "{"id": 4}" and I need it to just be {"id": 4}, is there a simple way to do this?
[05:47:56] <jwg2s> I originally got it by doing this: $(this).data('task')
[05:48:16] <ravenzz> well
[05:48:25] <ravenzz> so you have a string?
[05:49:13] <ravenzz> jwg2s
[05:49:18] <jwg2s> Yep
[05:49:29] <ravenzz> and the id is quoted right?
[05:49:34] <jwg2s> Yep
[05:49:47] <ravenzz> $.parseJSON('{"id": 4}')
[05:50:04] <ravenzz> if the content is valid json you can do that ^
[05:50:24] <ravenzz> otherwise it is a bit trickier
[05:50:41] <jwg2s> I get syntax error unexpected token
[05:50:54] <jwg2s> So I don't think it's valid json
[05:51:03] <jwg2s> There are more attributes than just id
[05:51:04] <ravenzz> maybe
[05:51:07] <ravenzz> k
[05:51:14] <ravenzz> well is it safe data?
[05:51:28] <jwg2s> What do you mean by safe?
[05:51:55] <ravenzz> that is server side sanitized and not modified by users
[05:52:54] <jwg2s> Yep
[05:53:21] <ravenzz> I am not sure if what I am about to suggest is the best thing to do
[05:53:27] <ravenzz> but eval() should do it
[06:02:41] <seutje> jwg2s: be sure to "use strict"; when evalling
[06:03:12] <seutje> -> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions_and_function_scope/Strict_mode?redirectlocale=en-US&redirectslug=JavaScript%2FReference%2FFunctions_and_function_scope%2FStrict_mode#Making_eval_and_arguments_simpler

[07:52:01] <jmverges_> I checked stackoverflow but their solutions doesn't work for me
[08:00:50] <aboudreault> hey, does jquery do some smart things internally to not fetch ajax duplicate requests?
[08:02:53] <MrChairman> In the docs why would they use $ before a variable name: http://api.jquery.com/jquery.parsexml/
[08:03:15] <MrChairman> Such as $title = $xml.find( "title" );
[08:04:36] <shoky> MrChairman: just to signify that it's a jquery object. it's just some convention, doesn't affect anything
[08:05:10] <shoky> aboudreault: i don't think so
[08:05:49] <MrChairman> Thanks
[08:06:29] <aboudreault> shoky, I was trying to understand why, with many  duplicate requests (urls) done by backbone.model.fetch. I only see 1 request of each url in the network tab.
[08:07:02] <shoky> aboudreault: i donno. maybe backbone does something?
[08:07:15] <aboudreault> it's not an issue for sure... but I want to understad that part. note that I'm doing a log a backbone.model.fetch, and when I do a $.when($, promises_array)
[08:07:27] <aboudreault> will continue my investigation.
[08:12:13] <NBhosting> why doesnt this work
[08:12:14] <NBhosting> https://dpaste.de/udH2
[08:12:15] <NBhosting> $("div[id^='mes']").style.display = 'block';
[09:05:56] <mrchris> Hi All.  I need to provide my client with a stylish image gallery that will allow the user to upload images and then move them around into different positions.  A tile gallery would be good, or even a grid gallery.  But the requirement to move images around all in the same pane is important.  Any recommendations?
[09:11:17] <duch_kazatel> mrchris sounds like you want something fairly custom.  jqueryui might have some helpful tools for that, but i'm not sure i've seen anything fully like what you're looking at doing.
[09:11:39] <mrchris> duch_kazatel: ok thanksw
[09:11:53] <MrChairman> believe in yourself, Mr. Chris
[09:12:58] <mrchris> duch_kazatel: Do you know of a decent canvas component that allows images to be moved around on a surface?
[09:13:38] <duch_kazatel> mrchris nope.  and depending on your requirements, I might not go that route.
[09:14:13] <mrchris> duch_kazatel: that is the current solution i've been using for 4 years with the client, but it's unreliable.
[09:14:22] <mrchris> I need to switch to something simpler
[09:14:48] <mrchris> Basically, they want their users to upload images - with a caption- and have it look stylish.
[09:15:27] <duch_kazatel> you mentioned somenthing about drag and drop?
[09:15:29] <mrchris> MrChairman:  I do, Mr chairman
[09:15:51] <mrchris> duch_kazatel: yes that would be nice, but it might not be required if there's no already existing solutions that will do it
[09:16:03] <mrchris> they want something that has a bit of pinache
[09:16:44] <duch_kazatel> it sounds like they want a full image gallery solution.  you might find something out there, but I'd reccommend reading up on various drag+drop techniques and go from ther.e
[09:16:48] <duch_kazatel> that'd be the hard part, imo.
[09:21:08] <mrchris> duch_kazatel: I'm not a javascript expert and I don't really want to spend much time on this
[09:22:40] <duch_kazatel> mrchris then i'm not sure what to tell you.  you want a full solution it sounds like.  somebody else might have some suggestions, but you're going to have to do some work on your own.
[09:23:13] <mrchris> duch_kazatel: :-) http://vnjs.net/www/project/freewall/example/draggable.html
[09:23:30] <duch_kazatel> woahdamn performance.
[09:23:57] <duch_kazatel> and that's for just the grid layout.  good luck if that's what you want :)
[09:24:33] <mrchris> duch_kazatel: you mean crap performance?
[09:24:35] <decx> making a pinterest grid as my clients like to call it will be the least of your worries for user gen content
[09:25:09] <duch_kazatel> yeah that thing performs like ass.  i'd wonder how images would work with that.
[09:25:53] <decx> animating the realignment might be overkill here, lol
[09:25:58] <duch_kazatel> yeah...
[09:32:59] <daslicht> anyone familiar with selectize.js ?
[09:33:19] <daslicht> I am trying to populate it with some data via an ajax call
[09:33:28] <daslicht> http://jsfiddle.net/daslicht/F3K3K/
[09:33:58] <daslicht> this is from the selectize demo page
[09:34:38] <duch_kazatel> what's wrong with it?
[09:34:44] <Paladine> Hi, I have a bunch of divs with numbered id's like "fulltext-0" "fulltext-1" ... "fulltext-30" and I want to grab the html content from within one of those divs and put it into another div when an element is clicked (the id of the content is based on the id of the clicked element "button-0", "button-1" ... "button-30") anyone know how I can do it?
[09:34:47] <daslicht> the demo service returns something like this:
[09:34:48] <daslicht> https://api.github.com/legacy/repos/search/test
[09:36:14] <daslicht> my server response looks like this:
[09:36:14] <daslicht> http://marcwensauer.de/public/dummy.json
[09:36:32] <daslicht> but when I try it locally the callback is never called
[09:36:36] <daslicht> what am i missing ?
[09:36:47] <duch_kazatel> Paladine there are a few ways to do it, but there's likely a better way to do it.
[09:36:54] <decx> Paladine you can split('-').pop() your button id and use that to target your div, but a cleaner solution would be the use of data- attributes for that kind of thing
[09:37:30] <duch_kazatel> "when i try it locally" - are you trying to load the json off your hard drive?
[09:37:32] <duch_kazatel> ooor...?
[09:37:40] <Paladine> this is what I have so far but it isn't working
[09:37:41] <Paladine> http://www.pastebin.ca/2591674
[09:37:53] <Paladine> and the button id's are just numbers no button-prefix
[09:38:02] <Paladine> was just using that as an example
[09:38:55] <daslicht> locally with my symfony2 setup...
[09:39:09] <daslicht> local webserver
[09:39:43] <daslicht> i tried it also oneline with jsfiddle but I get cross site errors
[09:39:52] <duch_kazatel> daslicht so you're not getting some kind of error with the JSON feed?  because the fiddle is working.
[09:40:04] <daslicht> no
[09:40:07] <daslicht> no errors
[09:40:30] <jphase> Paladine: make a jsfiddle - it'll be easier to help you
[09:40:56] <duch_kazatel> daslicht - http://i.imgur.com/659j4W4.png
[09:41:02] <daslicht> btw how can that work in jsfiddle , I thought for crossscripting you need to use jsonp insteadof json no?
[09:41:26] <duch_kazatel> daslicht you can use JSON just fine.  depends on the server config.
[09:41:30] <daslicht> dutch_kazatel: that using the DEMO service
[09:41:40] <daslicht> http://marcwensauer.de/public/dummy.json
[09:41:44] <daslicht> thats my service
[09:42:11] <duch_kazatel> is your server's CORS setup correct?
[09:42:46] <daslicht> my server is not setup ... i just like to show you the datastructure
[09:43:07] <daslicht> as i said I test it locally with my local setup
[09:43:22] <daslicht> i just wonder why the callback is not called
[09:43:31] <duch_kazatel> the callback IS called from what i can tell.
[09:45:39] <Paladine> jphasse, sec working on that fiddle
[09:45:44] <Paladine> jphase too
[09:45:57] <jphase> heh
[09:46:15] <decx> Paladine your paste has: .attr('id)
[09:46:20] <daslicht> dutch_kazatel: yes with the demo service
[09:46:20] <decx> fyi
[09:46:26] <jphase> oo, good eye decx
[09:46:32] <daslicht> dutch_kazatel: http://i.imgur.com/Drf6VNh.png
[09:46:41] <Paladine> dec, yeah I noticed that but it still didn't fix it
[09:46:44] <daslicht> thats how it looks locally with my service
[09:47:10] <daslicht> as you can see the res contains my results but the callback is never called :)
[09:47:20] <daslicht> strange stuff
[09:54:22] <Paladine> jphase, ok I pasted the entire page into fiddle because trying to get little pieces to work was a pain in the butt - but all I am interested in is the chart http://jsfiddle.net/2qJEQ/1/
[09:54:43] <Paladine> the first row of colour blocks (not the grey blocks) all have ID ranging from 0-4
[09:55:00] <jphase> k
[09:55:24] <Paladine> when you click one of them it should grab the html from the corresponding "div id="fulltext-#"> below (where # is the number of the ID)
[09:55:33] <Paladine> and put it in the modal box
[09:55:50] <decx> are attributes without quotes valid?
[09:55:58] <Paladine> it is so people can just click on a cell in the chart to get the relecant privacy info without having to read the entire things
[09:56:14] <jphase> decx: not unless you mean the attributes with =
[09:56:28] <decx> ye like div id=logo
[09:56:46] <jphase> hmm, I don't think that's technically valid, like w3c-wise
[09:56:57] <Paladine> technically for html5 it is valid
[09:57:03] <jphase> it will definitely make ie8 explode, but so will most things
[09:57:08] <Paladine> but I will be quoting all attributes in the final build
[09:57:08] <jphase> so in 4 months, that's valid
[09:57:09] <jphase> ;)
[09:57:26] <Paladine> well the entire site is html5 based but you can't see the doctype cos fiddle complains so I took it out
[09:57:35] <decx> yeah, i was just surprised that it even worked
[09:57:48] <Paladine> well fiddle is set for html5 so ;)
[09:58:04] <Paladine> under fiddle options dtd = html5
[09:58:09] <decx> the more you know ------>>
[09:58:58] <decx> Paladine well i took your paste and it does work for that in my fiddle
[09:59:01] <Paladine> so what I need to do is put the text from the associated div into the modal on line 13 in the javascript
[09:59:08] <decx> http://jsfiddle.net/decx/p2MT9/
[09:59:49] <Paladine> ok I will have another look I might have typoed in my original code
[10:00:25] <duch_kazatel> you have to use quotes UNLESS your values contain double quotes, single quotes, spaces, equals signs, or the greater-than signs.
[10:00:49] <duch_kazatel> rather, quotes are NOT required unless your values contain double quotes, single quotes, spaces, equals signs, or the greater-than signs.
[10:01:01] <duch_kazatel> sorry, caffeine hasn't kicked in yet.
[10:04:16] <Paladine> decx, yeah I must have had another typo because it is working now, well almost ;)
[10:04:58] <blue_warlock> hello
[10:05:15] <blue_warlock> somebody knows how to resize the ckeditor window for given id ?
[10:05:39] <blue_warlock> i have found this http://docs.cksource.com/CKEditor_3.x/Howto/Editor_Size
[10:07:03] <blue_warlock> but doesnt work
[10:07:11] <blue_warlock> my version is 4.3.2
[10:07:53] <decx> depending on your install it might be somewhere else, for example i have an oxid shop where the size is called somewhere in the module config
[10:08:11] <decx> i can ask my backend guy for details :>
[10:09:47] <Paladine> ok it is working now I had to add an extra line of code to display all the text
[10:09:49] <Paladine> 		$("#modal .sub-section-content").css('display', 'block');
[10:09:51] <Otaara> hi, all -- i'm in the process of teaching myself jquery, & am looking for any walkthrough/tutorial things where they have you actually code stuff, not just explain how to do so.  suggestions?
[10:10:06] <sky> Otaara: do you know javascript?
[10:10:13] <Otaara> reasonably well ;)
[10:10:32] <sky> what is the task?
[10:11:04] <Otaara> i feel like i'm at a point where i need to be making things to learn more, but the projects i envision are more complex than what i can probably do without a lot of headaches & posts here/at stackexchange
[10:11:30] <Otaara> my end goal is to be basically fluent to support my abilities in content writing/marketing
[10:11:47] <blue_warlock> decx plx
[10:12:08] <sky> Otaara: so you want to be a programmer or a content writer/marketer? :)
[10:12:11] <blue_warlock> i need to resize the textarea with id="article" and make it higher
[10:12:21] <sky> Otaara: build something you would like to use
[10:12:30] <sky> make it work the want you want
[10:12:41] <Paladine> decx - now I just need to pretty up the modal panel :)
[10:12:47] <sky> start small with measurable goals
[10:12:56] <Otaara> i'd like to be a content writer who can do more programming than i can currently, so smaller outfits that just want to hire "a web person" might be interested me
[10:17:43] <blue_warlock> a
[10:20:33] <blue_warlock> who knows how to resize the CKEditoer window for a give id pls ?
[10:24:31] <newbsduser> guys how can remove  all sub-tags in a <fieldset> tag
[10:27:40] <duch_kazatel> newbsduser not sure what you're asking - are you asking how to empty a <fieldset>
[10:28:01] <newbsduser> let me try .empty();
[10:28:24] <duch_kazatel> newbsduser not sure what you're asking, but give that a shot i guess.
[10:28:34] <duch_kazatel> blue_warlock it's pretty likely nobody in here has any experience with CKEditor.
[10:29:06] <blue_warlock> hell
[10:29:10] <blue_warlock> and wut do you use?
[10:29:20] <duch_kazatel> for what?
[10:29:53] <duch_kazatel> oh an in-page WYSIWYG?
[10:29:59] <duch_kazatel> we use a few at my job.  none stick out.
[10:30:21] <blue_warlock> pfffffff
[10:30:23] <pu239> i have a modal dialog i'm showing, everything works fine, except if i cancel the form and then go back to the form, when i do that it submits twice
[10:30:32] <blue_warlock> i have 40 websites to update
[10:30:32] <krambiorix> how can i cache the autocomplete source data?
[10:30:34] <pu239> i'm sure i'm missing something simple, do i unbind the form?
[10:30:35] <blue_warlock> T_T
[10:31:08] <Es0teric> when showing/hiding content, can i dynamically show/hide based on the anchor's href and div id?
[10:31:22] <blue_warlock> fckeditor its a pain , it has so many bugs that i stopped to count them
[10:31:25] <duch_kazatel> pu239 sounds like you're binding the event twice.
[10:31:43] <duch_kazatel> pu239 look up event delegation and use that instead.
[10:31:56] <duch_kazatel> Es0teric sure.  simple if (){}
[10:32:13] <Es0teric> duch_kazatel let me show you what i have so far
[10:33:06] <Es0teric> duch_kazatel http://pastie.org/private/f9divtsyiyrlvir2sokrea so on every "active" i want it to go the corresponding div
[10:33:58] <duch_kazatel> aaaah you're trying to remove all other .active's.
[10:34:19] <Es0teric> duch_kazatel yeah, so i want each current .active to show the div thats corresponding to it
[10:34:20] <duch_kazatel> id. replace line 5 with $('.nav > li.active').removeClass('active');
[10:34:43] <decx> *gasp* unoptimized selector
[10:35:39] <duch_kazatel> if .active is only getting used on those LIs, I'd do $('.nav > .active').removeClass('active'); OR just $('.active').removeClass('active');
[10:36:01] <Es0teric> duch_kazatel ok but what about the divs that i want to show/hide?
[10:36:14] <duch_kazatel> Es0teric I'd need to see a fuller example in a fiddle.
[10:36:23] <duch_kazatel> because i have no idea what you're markup looks like.
[10:36:37] <Es0teric> duch_kazatel my markup is twitter bootstrap style
[10:36:55] <duch_kazatel> congratS?  fiddle it please.
[10:38:01] <Es0teric> duch_kazatel thats alot of...
[10:38:06] <Es0teric> duch_kazatel sec
[10:38:32] <duch_kazatel> okay, then give me more info - is there a div ID or class or something? you're not giving me nearly enough info to help.
[10:38:44] <duch_kazatel> $('div').show() is one way to show a div.
[10:39:09] <duch_kazatel> i get the feeling that is completely unhelpful to you because i don't know how you're trying to tie a given div to a given li.
[10:40:19] <pu239> duch_kazatel: thanks for the help
[10:40:32] <duch_kazatel> pu239 did it help?
[10:41:06] <pu239> duch_kazatel: it's working now, i was obviously (now that I looked at again) binding the form every time i clicked the button
[10:43:06] <duch_kazatel> pu239 aaaah.  yeah.  that's one of the reasons I don't bind events on, say, click.
[10:43:49] <pu239> i goofed up, this is still new to me, appreciate the advice
[10:44:08] <duch_kazatel> of course :)
[10:44:35] <Lope> I'm running an $.ajax request and its coming back with error. I've got no idea why, When I right click the link that shows the error in firebug and say Open in new Tab, it works perfectly. When I inspect the Response and the HTML it's empty. Any ideas?
[10:46:09] <shoky> Lope: could be a cross-domain issue. check in chrome and look at the console
[10:46:43] <duch_kazatel> Lope sounds like the server doesn't allow you to use their data like that.
[10:47:18] <Lope> Yes I'm doing cross domain
[10:47:34] <Lope> why doesn't firefox let me do a cross domain ajax request? how can I enable it?
[10:47:39] <shoky> then the server needs to explicitly support it
[10:48:03] <Lope> why would it have anything to do with the server? I'm making the request from the browser?
[10:48:04] <shoky> via CORS or JSONP
[10:48:37] <shoky> the browser doesn't allow you to do cross-domain ajax requests unless the server sends CORS headers in the response
[10:48:54] <shoky> it's the same-origin policy
[10:49:05] <jedimind> Lope unless the server that you are grabbing the data from directly allows you to do so, the browser wont let you
[10:49:07] <jedimind> which makes sense
[10:49:18] <shoky> (and JSONP is a hack to disguise an ajax request in a <script> tag)
[10:49:19] <jedimind> otherwise people would be ripping each other's content off all ove rthe place
[10:49:57] <Lope> okay
[10:51:06] <Lope> firebug should give a decent error at least.
[10:51:16] <duch_kazatel> what error does it give you right now?
[10:51:17] <shoky> correct. but firebug sucks ;p
[10:51:24] <shoky> firebug doesn't say shit about cross-domain issues
[10:51:28] <shoky> no way to know
[10:51:32] <duch_kazatel> i
[10:51:44] <duch_kazatel> *i've never had that kind of problem i guess, and i use firebug.
[10:51:54] <shoky> go check.. it just doesn't
[10:51:58] <shoky> no indication
[10:52:34] <duch_kazatel> hah, now to find an endpoint that doesn't allow CORS.
[10:52:43] <Lope> huh isn't it the browser that denies the ajax request?
[10:53:01] <shoky> Lope yes, but based on the server's response jheaders
[10:53:23] <Lope> then firebug should tell you why the AJAX request is failing (methinks)
[10:53:31] <shoky> like i said, correct
[10:53:48] <duch_kazatel> and tbh, if I have have a cross-domain request that fails in the console but not in a new tab, i go and check the headers in firebug.
[10:54:02] <Lope> I put this in my PHP file, but it hasn't helped yet: header('Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *');
[10:54:02] <duch_kazatel> which you can do in the console.
[10:54:16] <shoky> yeah but you're fortunate to have a clue about it ;p
[10:54:22] <duch_kazatel> lol that's fair.
[10:54:25] <newbsduser> how can set label's font size... i tried $("#page1 label").css("font-size","12px");
[10:54:26] <newbsduser> not worked
[10:54:44] <newbsduser> i just want to set label's under #page1 div
[10:54:44] <shoky> Lope: you're not requesting that PHP with the ajax request, right
[10:54:57] <shoky> Lope: the CORS headers need to come from the server you're doing the ajax to
[10:55:15] <newbsduser> ladies
[10:55:31] <rpd> newbsduser: post a fiddle of what you expect
[10:55:33] <duch_kazatel> newbsduser and $("#page1 label"). matches?
[10:55:42] <duch_kazatel> because if that doesn't, you're hosed.
[10:56:03] <newbsduser> let me try again
[10:56:23] <Lope> shoky: I'm loading up mainpage.php where I've put the header. then I'm loading ajaxpage.php in an ajax request and I've put the header there as well.
[10:56:50] <shoky> Lope: i thought you said your ajax request is to another server?
[10:57:00] <shoky> these 2 phps are different servers?
[10:57:20] <Lope> awesome. okay I got it sorted :)
[10:57:30] <Lope> I f'd it up. was my fault.
[10:57:52] <shoky> coolsies
[10:58:06] <Lope> you were right. the header must be on the file that gets requested
[10:59:01] <newbsduser> $("#page1 label span").css("font-size","12px");
[10:59:02] <newbsduser> it worked
[10:59:05] <krambiorix> what am i doing wrong? I have multiple input fields that need an autocomplete. But it only works on the first one... http://jsfiddle.net/N49pS/
[11:08:12] <Es0teric> duch_kazatel are you still there?
[11:08:14] <duch_kazatel> yup.
[11:10:05] <Es0teric> duch_kazatel give me a few more mins i am still doing this lol
[11:12:28] <Es0teric> duch_kazatel - http://jsfiddle.net/b3LQs/show/#
[11:13:07] <blakespo1> So I've discussed this briefly here, but I'm back to this - must solve...
[11:13:08] <Es0teric> so essentially i want it to show link 1 when link 1 on the nav is clicked, and hide everything else, when link 2 is clicked on the nav, link 2 container will show
[11:13:12] <Es0teric> duch_kazatel
[11:13:12] <blakespo1> http://jsfiddle.net/Velveeta/Dw6V8/2/
[11:13:35] <blakespo1> The flyout menu needs to stay open when I move the mouse from the red item into the menu itself
[11:14:08] <blakespo1> someone suggested making the menu a child of the button - not familiar with that approach. Is that the best route?
[11:15:50] <decx> the best route is not to use hover effects to change large parts of the ui
[11:16:18] <decx> other than that you can get rid of the mouseleave and close other slides on the mouseenter event
[11:16:59] <decx> also, didn't Velveeta give you a version with a css transition instead of the jq animate stuff
[11:17:47] <blakespo1> He suggested using CSS transitions - I didn't see him show code. I hope I didn't miss it. if he did...
[11:18:12] <decx> yeah i totally saw that css version like 3 days ago, and then some cursewords because you left
[11:18:14] <decx> ;)
[11:18:25] <blakespo1> dammit
[11:18:58] <blakespo1> was it a fiddle?
[11:19:50] <shoky> blakespo1 i got it in my backscroll - http://jsfiddle.net/Velveeta/Dw6V8/15/
[11:20:26] <clime> hey anyone can help with jquery ui autocompletion (http://jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#default) ?  If you click into the field and type "a", it will open a select box. Then you click aside so that focus is lost and select box closes. Finally you click back into the field. Now if you delete the "a" and type it immediately after again, no selectbox is shown. Is there a way to fix this behaviour?
[11:20:30] <Velveeta> yeah, when i posted it, you weren't responding, and then you eventually disappeared :)
[11:21:02] <duch_kazatel> Es0teric sorry was away for a sec.  looking now.
[11:21:15] <shoky> blakespo1 and here's an easy update to keep it open http://jsfiddle.net/Dw6V8/16/
[11:21:34] <blakespo1> shoky: Damn - thanks! I was looking back through mine - it ends too soon
[11:22:16] <shoky> there's always irc.jquery.com for logs too
[11:22:25] <blakespo1> thanks Velveeta and shoky too
[11:22:42] <blakespo1> Yea, this new job it's 3 meetings a day minimum
[11:22:44] <blakespo1> christ
[11:22:58] <Velveeta> ha! i wish i could get back down to that many meetings :D
[11:23:18] <blakespo1> hrm
[11:23:24] <Velveeta> today's one of the rare days when i only had 2 on my calendar, so i opted to work from home, because they're both ones i can do remotely :)
[11:23:45] <duch_kazatel> Es0teric this is easy :)
[11:23:52] <decx> who doesn't hate meetings?
[11:23:55] <decx> besides suits
[11:24:07] <clime> That is I want to fire change event upon keypresses without checking if value has been changed
[11:24:09] <Es0teric> decx besides suits?
[11:24:29] <Es0teric> duch_kazatel lol yeah… i kind of lost my touch with jquery on simple stuff like that… i havent used jquery in about 4 or 5 months
[11:24:32] <decx> i'm bitter because i had 3 today
[11:24:52] <duch_kazatel> Es0teric you do have control over any of the markup?
[11:24:59] <shoky> clime: i'm not seeing that behaviour. it shows up again
[11:24:59] <Es0teric> duch_kazatel yes i do
[11:25:12] <Paladine> decx you can see it working now here - http://www.privatebrowser.org/pb-new/privacy.php
[11:25:14] <Es0teric> duch_kazatel i have control over the entire project
[11:25:26] <Paladine> I still need to prettify the modal box I think but the functionality is there
[11:25:33] <Es0teric> decx what do you mean "besides suits" though? lol
[11:25:38] <duch_kazatel> Es0teric ok, I'm going to "blow your mnind"
[11:25:44] <shoky> clime: well i only see it if i select the text with the mouse and overwrite it
[11:25:50] <Es0teric> lol duch_kazatel go right ahead
[11:25:55] <decx> Es0teric i chimed in to another conversation
[11:26:11] <Es0teric> decx was the conversation about suits?
[11:26:15] <blakespo1> I see the webkit-transforms in the CSS
[11:26:15] <decx> Paladine i dont want to sound preaching, but why not use buttons for ui elements that aren't links
[11:26:27] <blakespo1> will this approach work, as shown, for other modenr browsers?
[11:26:27] <decx> like that x button
[11:26:30] <clime> shoky: you need to it fast (deleting and retyping a)
[11:26:37] <Paladine> decx just wish I could figure out an easy way to vertically align the grey button text in the middle - everything I tried just screws up the position of the button
[11:26:46] <clime> after you the focus has been lost before
[11:27:07] <Paladine> decx cos I didn't want to use buttons
[11:27:10] <Velveeta> blakespo1: you'd have to use other transform prefixes to make sure it works in all modern browsers
[11:27:20] <Velveeta> i was just being lazy and only included the chrome prefixes ;)
[11:27:24] <shoky> clime: oks yea.. adunno ;p
[11:29:01] <duch_kazatel> Es0teric this is hacky, but it should give you a direction to look in: http://jsfiddle.net/b3LQs/1/
[11:30:20] <Es0teric> duch_kazatel checking now
[11:32:02] <Es0teric> duch_kazatel yeah i see… it is a little hacky lol
[11:32:28] <duch_kazatel> Es0teric the general idea is to avoid running regex on strings if it isn't necessary - give yourself the data you're going to need.
[11:32:37] <duch_kazatel> so use data attributes/etc to accomplish that.
[11:32:45] <Es0teric> that makes sense
[11:32:59] <duch_kazatel> also, i'd check to make sure you can't do all of this via bootstrap - pretty sure you can.
[11:33:08] <decx> is there no better way than element[data-attribute=""] to target an element with a data attribute?
[11:33:30] <decx> should be as easy as grabbing an id imho
[11:33:38] <decx> data attributes are so prevalent
[11:33:45] <Es0teric> duch_kazatel bootstrap has scrollspy… but i dont really like it
[11:33:47] <duch_kazatel> they are now - they didn't use to me.
[11:34:11] <duch_kazatel> err woah - didn't used to be.
[11:34:13] <duch_kazatel> fo
[11:34:23] <duch_kazatel> *for now you have to use attribute selectors.
[11:34:28] <duch_kazatel> and Es0teric I mean tab controls.
[11:34:54] <Es0teric> duch_kazatel oh yeah it does have tab controls
[11:34:57] <Es0teric> maybe i can use that...
[11:35:03] <duch_kazatel> http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#tabs
[11:35:04] <duch_kazatel> use that.
[11:35:19] <duch_kazatel> imo, if you're using bootstrap, use bootstrap
[11:35:38] <Es0teric> duch_kazatel yeah already working on it lol
[11:44:37] <Es0teric> yeah duch_kazatel the tabs worked from bootstrap, i modified it a little but it worked
[11:46:38] <duch_kazatel> there you go.
[11:49:59] <maxmoore14> JQM css sets overflow-x: hidden; my problem is, I'd like to display a small element over body margins (left and right edges)
[11:50:18] <maxmoore14> any way to override that with css?
[11:50:54] <maxmoore14> don't want to change the overflow setting on the whole body content, just looking to move an item over it
[11:51:07] <maxmoore14> I've tried setting z-index to a very high number, but no luck
[11:51:25] <maxmoore14> it is being positioned correctly, but is hidden
[11:51:49] <jedimind> if the overflow is set to hidden; then no amount of z-index will fix that
[11:51:57] <jedimind> also i wouldnt remove it because it would cause complications with other things probably
[11:52:00] <krambiorix> what am i doing wrong? I have multiple input fields that need an autocomplete. But it only works on the first one... http://jsfiddle.net/N49pS/
[11:52:04] <jedimind> pertaining to the jqm transitions / interactions
[11:52:29] <jedimind> krambiorix you didnt provide your html so not sure
[11:53:38] <maxmoore14> jedimind: yeah, I think you are right. The only way would be to move the element outside of the one with overflow: hidden, right?
[11:53:47] <jedimind> yeah max
[11:54:05] <maxmoore14> thx
[11:56:14] <krambiorix> jedimind, http://jsfiddle.net/N49pS/1/
[11:59:24] <krambiorix> jedimind, the input fields are created with a button
[11:59:59] <jedimind> could you make your testcase actually function?
[12:04:12] <krambiorix> jedimind, almost ... http://jsfiddle.net/N49pS/2/
[12:09:03] <krambiorix> jedimind, can you give me just any clue, i'm stuck
[12:18:33] <sunbeam> Hi, i'm looking for a certain prettyphoto skin, any ideas where I can find?
[12:18:36] <sunbeam> or an alternative plugin
[12:20:42] <duch_kazatel> sunbeam just looking for a lightbox?  or...?
[12:21:46] <logikos> I'm useing $('#blah').on('submit','#formid',function(event){ alert('submit?'); }); the form markup contains <button> tags and <input type="submit" > tags .. How do i make the on submit javascript function only execute when I click a input type="submit" button .. rather than the <button> tags ?
[12:22:04] <logikos> i was very surprized that on submit was triggering when clicking a button which does not submit the form...
[12:22:22] <BillCriswell> logikos: You can put type="button" on the button.
[12:22:35] <BillCriswell> I think.
[12:23:17] <BillCriswell> Yes, that's right.
[12:24:04] <logikos> ty
[12:24:24] <logikos> seems strange that for a button tag you need a type="button" attribute .. but as long as it works i dont care right now
[12:24:26] <logikos> tlol
[12:25:07] <BillCriswell> logikos: I agree. It's weird.
[13:00:24] <krambiorix> BillCriswell, can you give me a hand? ... http://jsfiddle.net/N49pS/2/
[13:02:23] <BillCriswell> What's the issue?
[13:02:53] <BillCriswell> Also, if you use jsbin for your demo it can load jquery ui pretty easily.
[13:04:51] <decx> BillCriswell ... fighting the good fight against jsfiddle monopoly ;)
[13:07:13] <krambiorix> BillCriswell, http://jsbin.com/oJiwaNO/1/
[13:18:30] <HenryCH> Hi everyone, could anyone please tell me why this isn't applying the submenu class to the child li's
[13:18:40] <HenryCH> http://jsfiddle.net/cV68E/
[13:22:06] <decx> this (span) parent (li.mainhead) children (undefined)
[13:22:38] <HenryCH> the parent is the li that holds the span right? because this points to the span am I wrong?
[13:22:58] <decx> the children of li.mainhead are span and ul
[13:23:09] <tandroid> HenryCH: http://jsfiddle.net/cV68E/2/
[13:23:39] <HenryCH> ohhh I see
[13:24:12] <tandroid> a few problems. One, you didn't load jquery, you didn't close your click function, and you were targeting something that wasn't there
[13:25:34] <tandroid> All simple mistakes, but that's often all it is!
[13:26:07] <decx> well if we're picky then the selector is inefficient :>
[13:26:48] <tandroid> decx: care to explain?
[13:27:04] <decx> $('.sidebar').find('.expand') and $('.expand','.sidebar') are both much more efficient than $('.sidebar .expand')
[13:27:39] <tandroid> Oh, good to know
[13:27:42] <decx> http://jsperf.com/findvschildren/2
[13:27:48] <decx> semi related perf
[13:29:41] <tandroid> decx: I would have never guessed that. thanks for sharing
[13:30:22] <decx> i never used to bothered with it but 50% gain can't be denied :D
[13:30:54] <tandroid> Seriously, I'll definitely be changing how I do things now!
[13:31:14] <decx> yeah i went through all my files when i found out about it as well hehe
[13:31:16] <ankurk> I am using jQuery UI's autocomplete, how can I make the user select first option automatically when he presses the Enter button?
[13:31:20] <HenryCH> did you guys see my message after you linked your fiddle?
[13:31:43] <HenryCH> my wireless is very weak here
[13:31:57] <HenryCH> i saw your fiddle tandroid
[13:32:03] <decx> only: "oh i see"
[13:32:56] <HenryCH> so why don't the 3 lis with the submenu class appear
[13:32:59] <HenryCH> http://jsfiddle.net/cV68E/3/
[13:33:01] <tandroid> HenryCH: we were just discussing that $("#sidebar).find(".expand"); would be more efficient
[13:33:25] <HenryCH> ah
[13:33:46] <HenryCH> and then what would be the best way to find the 3 li children with "test"
[13:33:48] <decx> it gets the submenu class
[13:34:06] <tandroid> because it's display none
[13:34:11] <HenryCH> I was thinking $(this).parent().children('ul').children('li')
[13:34:16] <HenryCH> but that looks wrong :P
[13:34:49] <HenryCH> the submenu class is supposed to override the display none to display block right?
[13:36:13] <HenryCH> http://jsfiddle.net/cV68E/4/
[13:36:17] <HenryCH> got it
[13:36:45] <HenryCH> now what would have been the most efficient way of targeting the li's to apply the toggleclass, certainly not mine or?
[13:37:14] <decx> would make more sense to append an expanded class to the li and just do .expanded ul { display: block }
[13:37:41] <jedimind> how would setting that class on LI help with the UL ?
[13:37:57] <decx> on the one with the class mainhead
[13:38:10] <decx> this parent toggleclass expanded
[13:38:20] <decx> something like that
[13:38:34] <decx> or directly on the ul
[13:38:42] <decx> this next (ul) toggleclass
[13:39:02] <tandroid> http://jsfiddle.net/cV68E/6/
[13:40:01] <tandroid> I assume thats what you meant, decx
[13:40:06] <decx> yeah that'll do
[13:40:17] <tandroid> That way seems more clean to me
[13:40:28] <Bentrand> Hi guys! I am struggling a little with some really simple jquery.. I was hoping you could spot my mistake easily? :) I just want the theme to change on the li that is clicked. http://jsfiddle.net/RyQ2r/
[13:41:35] <Bentrand> well that's not totally true.. I want all the li with that class to go to theme a apart from the one clicked that should get the theme b
[13:44:15] <dan2k3k4> uhh I'm working on fixing a shit/old project that I didn't have anything to do with ;( and there's some Smarty template that is a huge mess... but the jQuery is acting weird
[13:45:00] <dan2k3k4> basically there's an onclick="$('#l_0').toggle('blind', {}, 500);" but when you 'click', it basically toggles that div to show it (as it's display: none) but everything in the wrapper/parent div, becomes height 90px (or ~same height has one of the child divs)
[13:45:01] <dan2k3k4> o_0
[13:46:12] <dan2k3k4> child div is #l_0, parent is #listing - so no idea why jQuery/jQuery UI is changing/affecting parent div display? even checking the dom, seems it doesn't actually get touched/changed, just ends up looking like that, anyone come across weird toggle() behavior before?
[13:51:38] <decx> dan2k3k4 i'm a medium so i can help without a fiddle. it seems that gremlins have taken over your smarty because you didnt buy enough curly braces for christmas
[13:52:06] <decx> but replace toggle blind from jqui with the native .slideToggle, that might help
[13:52:35] <dan2k3k4> decx: just .slideToggle() ? would it 'work' with those params?
[13:52:46] <decx> no need for any parameters
[13:52:57] <decx> i'm just assuming here but jquery ui blind does some weird stuff
[13:53:03] <tandroid> dan2k3k4: It could be an event propagation issue if there is other javascript.
[13:53:08] <jjenzz> Bentrand: is this what you're trying to do? http://jsfiddle.net/JJenZz/RyQ2r/1
[13:53:18] <dan2k3k4> decx: added {literal} in places that it would have needed it but didn't fix the issue -_- project also uses really old jq/jqui libs ;(
[13:53:36] <decx> yikes, well without seeing it's hard :>
[13:54:17] <Bentrand> jjenzz: Thank you! Yes something very similar but I would have 3 or 4 li with the class themedLevelChoice.
[13:54:45] <Bentrand> jjenzz: That's why I imagined the each might be necessary.
[13:55:40] <dan2k3k4> I don't think it's a problem with other JS files, seems to be a problem with how the HTML is setup
[13:56:16] <tandroid> Ahh… yeah without seeing it though it's hard to know
[13:56:34] <dan2k3k4> decx: (if you have 1920x1080 resolution, if not, zoom out) http://dev.mobile2.swissgeo.ch/saint-imier/imotion/index.php
[13:57:21] <dan2k3k4> then click "Hebergement" -> "Hotel" - then there's 3 etoiles or something similar
[13:57:33] <jjenzz> Bentrand: I've not used buttonMarkup before and assumed it would iterate over each matched item in the selector for you but if not… you can just do this instead: http://jsfiddle.net/JJenZz/RyQ2r/2/
[13:57:57] <Bentrand> Let me try! Thank you so much
[13:58:07] <dan2k3k4> when you click those, it disappears, but check the dom and just untick height then tick it again for #listing (no idea why it uses .listing and #listing for same div...)
[14:01:38] <jjenzz> Bentrand: sorry I missed a $(this)… 10pm here, I'm sleepy ha: http://jsfiddle.net/JJenZz/RyQ2r/3/
[14:02:17] <Bentrand> jjenzz: Yes, I saw and corrected. But somehow I am not sure why, it seems to not apply the theme to the entire li. Only to the <a>
[14:02:28] <Bentrand> I even tried with .parent() and still no luck
[14:02:56] <jjenzz> Bentrand: do you have a version of this up somewhere I can look at?
[14:04:39] <Bentrand> jjenzz: http://pastebin.com/jTZWVtTG
[14:05:18] <dan2k3k4> wait
[14:05:32] <dan2k3k4> I'm trying to figure out why #home_content has a style="opacity: 1"
[14:05:40] <dan2k3k4> seems that's added in from js?
[14:06:30] <dan2k3k4> ah it's because it 'fades' between page clicks
[14:10:38] <dan2k3k4> when did slideToggle become native? seems like after 1.7
[14:10:48] <jjenzz> Bentrand: is this not what you're trying to do? http://jsbin.com/AGEbujiG/1/edit
[14:11:13] <ankurk> is it possible to get the name tag's name on an input?
[14:13:07] <Bentrand> jjenzz: It totally is
[14:13:10] <Bentrand> Thank you so much
[14:13:12] <jjenzz> Bentrand: Seems you don't need the .each() either: http://jsbin.com/AGEbujiG/2/edit
[14:13:27] <Bentrand> Plus, I did not know about jsbin.com so double whammy :)
[14:14:09] <Bentrand> That totally works
[14:14:15] <HenryCH> read your messages and the fiddle, thanks decx
[14:14:25] <Bentrand> thank you jjenzz
[14:14:30] <Bentrand> Have a great evening :)
[14:14:36] <jjenzz> Bentrand: http://codepen.io is another that I love ;)
[14:14:51] <jjenzz> Bentrand: no worries, you too :) x
[14:15:05] <jjenzz> woah, auto pilot there with the 'x' hahah! Sorry…
[14:15:26] <Bentrand> codepen.io rocks! Thanks for that tip too!s
[14:17:16] <duch_kazatel> jsfiddle is my favorite.
[14:27:25] <dan2k3k4> http://pastebin.com/DNZJaAXV
[14:27:46] <dan2k3k4> that's the smarty template which seems to be causing problems (for the onclick part)
[14:30:21] <dan2k3k4> http://pastebin.com/38U4Lvkr and the HTML response from when clicking on one of the hebergement categories that would load the f'd tpl
[14:34:17] <Diamond> wtf i need halp
[14:34:19] <Diamond> =(
[14:37:17] <duch_kazatel> with?
[14:37:38] <Diamond> http://ckeditor.com/latest/samples/plugins/toolbar/toolbar.html
[14:37:41] <Diamond> =(
[14:37:51] <Diamond> it doesnt work
[14:38:08] <Diamond> i have setted this line in the header of page
[14:38:13] <duch_kazatel> http://ckeditor.com/support
[14:38:21] <Diamond> CKEDITOR.replace( 'articolo_id', 'basicstyles');
[14:38:26] <duch_kazatel> you'll have more luck there than here.
[14:38:46] <dan2k3k4> ok seems like it's a problem with .toggle('clip', {}, 500) decx
[14:39:04] <dan2k3k4> since changed it to just .toggle() and it's working a little bit better, but still buggy
[15:01:03] <jenia> hello
[15:02:00] <jenia> i use the info window in gogole maps. I need to add a call back to a button in the info window. does anyone know how to achieve that?
[15:03:43] <duch_kazatel> jenia have some same code?
[15:04:19] <jenia> sorry i didnt get it. you want me to paste bin some code?
[15:05:21] <jenia> yes
[15:05:26] <jenia> i want to do this:
[15:05:46] <jenia> $("#button").addListener("click", function(){});
[15:06:03] <tandroid> jenia: But that button is in a google map?
[15:06:04] <duch_kazatel> try $('button').on('click', function(){});
[15:06:06] <groundup> Is it possible, and how, would I do on('submit') and then fire off an AJAX request without preventing the form from submitting
[15:06:17] <jenia> 	var marker = new google.maps.Marker({
[15:06:17] <jenia> 	    position: position,
[15:06:17] <jenia> 	    map: map,
[15:06:17] <jenia> 	    icon : "static/images/red_marker.png"
[15:06:17] <jenia> 	});
[15:06:57] <duch_kazatel> jenia you'll have to target a parent container, then change it to something like $('parentSelector').on('click', '#button', function(){});
[15:07:04] <duch_kazatel> groundup not necesssaril;y.
[15:07:10] <duch_kazatel> groundup you'd run into a race contidion.
[15:08:19] <jenia> tandroid, yes. that button is in the info window in a google map
[15:08:33] <jenia> thanks duch_kazatel
[15:08:58] <duch_kazatel> jenia did that help?
[15:09:30] <jenia> one sec, im doing it real quick
[15:09:39] <HenryCH> what's the proper way of making a jquery function available to all my pages? should I place it in a .js and then script include it in the head?
[15:09:50] <duch_kazatel> HenryCH yes.
[15:09:59] <tandroid> HenryCH: or the footer
[15:10:10] <HenryCH> the footer?
[15:10:24] <duch_kazatel> down before the closing body tag.
[15:10:26] <duch_kazatel> before </body>
[15:11:03] <tandroid> scripts need to be run once all of the DOM is loaded. that means either using a body onload function or placing your script below all of the DOM
[15:11:07] <HenryCH> you mean placing the code there or the script that includes it
[15:11:18] <tandroid> Either one works
[15:11:18] <jenia> duch_kazatel, worked perfectly
[15:11:19] <jenia> thanks
[15:11:22] <HenryCH> I see
[15:11:23] <HenryCH> thanks
[15:11:34] <tandroid> It's better to include a script
[15:11:45] <duch_kazatel> jenia sure.
[15:11:46] <tandroid> Well, just to keep things clean
[15:12:13] <duch_kazatel> tandroid that's not necessarily true.  some scripts can (and maybe even should) run before the document is ready.
[15:12:54] <tandroid> dutch_kazetel: True, but not if it's using the DOM
[15:13:44] <duch_kazatel> tandroid sure.  i prefer to wrap everything in jquery closures for scoping purposes.
[15:13:50] <dan2k3k4> decx: ah finally fixed the problem, had to change onclick="$('l').toggle(params);$('other').toggle(params);" to $('l').toggle(); then use a simple if( $('other').css("display") === "none" and change with css for the img o_0
[15:14:11] <dan2k3k4> terrible code patched with even more terrible code... but it works...
[15:14:57] <tandroid> duch_kazatel, agreed. And sorry for butchering your username!
[15:15:22] <duch_kazatel> not a problem.
[15:15:24] <duch_kazatel> :)
[15:16:26] <HenryCH> jquery closures?
[15:16:36] <duch_kazatel> err, *jquery closure
[15:16:37] <duch_kazatel> and yeah.
[15:16:56] <duch_kazatel> $(function() {})
[15:17:56] <HenryCH> ok
[15:21:25] <teza19> Hi, I've created an RSS ticker script that extracts the headline and some basic content from the feed. I'm having some trouble with rendering the non-alphabet characters. The ampersand (&) is displaying as "&amp;" and likewise, I get some odd characters where there should be apostrophes ('), and other punctuation. What could be causing this?
[15:21:46] <duch_kazatel> the chars are escaped in the feed.  try to unescape them.
[15:22:50] <duch_kazatel> look at decodeURI/decodeURIComponent
[15:50:33] <HenryCH> do people usually just keep one file with all javascript functions?
[15:50:58] <sabotender> it looks like I can't set up a catcher for an element that is not currently present on the document
[15:51:20] <duch_kazatel> HenryCH not sure what you're asking.
[15:51:34] <duch_kazatel> sabotender you can only bind to elements that exist at time of binding.
[15:51:46] <HenryCH> I mean, if you have all your functions in one file, then you would have certain pages that include a whole bunch of functions that that page won't be using, right?
[15:51:47] <jakeCigar> $(document).on("click",".somefutureclass"…
[15:52:00] <sabotender> is it ok rebind elements?
[15:52:10] <duch_kazatel> sabotender look into using event delegation.
[15:52:17] <jakeCigar> don't rebind.
[15:52:19] <sabotender> I can call a function to bind the element when conditions change
[15:52:30] <duch_kazatel> don't do that.  use event delegation and be a bro.
[15:52:42] <sabotender> oh lord, okay I will look it up
[15:52:53] <duch_kazatel> HenryCH you could have one file of common functions, and then other files specific to certain pages.
[15:52:57] <duch_kazatel> that's one way to do it.
[15:53:23] <HenryCH> yea that would make sense
[15:53:31] <HenryCH> I'll do that
[15:54:00] <duch_kazatel> sabotender learn about the delegation syntax for .on() - jakeCigar gave you one example, though I suggest having your first selector be as specific as possible.
[15:54:05] <duch_kazatel> drill down as far as you can.
[15:54:37] <sabotender> eh, i already have the exact names of the new element ids
[15:54:53] <sabotender> its not like im working with unknowns
[15:54:56] <jakeCigar> don't use IDs. Use classes!
[15:55:01] <sabotender> i cant
[15:55:13] <sabotender> boostrap has hijacked the classes
[15:55:22] <duch_kazatel> sabotender $('#parentID').on('click', '.element', function(){});
[15:55:25] <sabotender> *bootstrap
[15:55:35] <jakeCigar> $(document).on("click","#some,#someother"…
[15:55:47] <duch_kazatel> jakeCigar i'd avoid binding to document like that.
[15:56:03] <sabotender> stop stop you are confusing me. I need to read up about delegation first
[15:56:06] <sabotender> i'll brb
[15:56:21] <jakeCigar> If you know the layout use a node, if you don't use document.
[15:57:09] <duch_kazatel> you should know the layout imo.
[16:00:22] <ecker> I've made a fixed-top nav menu, which only follows the scrolling for a section of the page using jQuery and html anchors. On every scroll event, it will change the 'top' value in the nav's css. test-page: http://snuti.net/web/floatingMenu/ source: http://pastebin.com/Msfka8H6
[16:00:34] <ecker> This is not an ideal solution, and does not work well on mobile browsers. How would I solve this problem differently, more optimised for all browsers?
[16:02:43] <sabotender> okay, i read about it, but I am using keyup, so I am not sure how to include that
[16:03:03] <duch_kazatel> sabotender replace 'click' with 'keyup'
[16:03:03] <sabotender> I am not binding clicks for this one
[16:03:06] <duch_kazatel> that's the event
[16:03:09] <sabotender> ahha
[16:03:24] <sabotender> wait, on("keyup" ?
[16:03:27] <sabotender> interesting
[16:03:34] <duch_kazatel> if keyup is a valid event, yes.
[16:04:05] <sabotender> it is a text field so it most definitely is I shall try it
[16:04:16] <duch_kazatel> what are you trying to do?
[16:05:14] <sabotender> stupid form validator
[16:05:19] <sabotender> I hate doing this crap
[16:06:05] <duch_kazatel> why not validate on blur or submit?
[16:06:12] <sabotender> i am changing the colour of the text field if the user enters invalid or valid data
[16:06:24] <duch_kazatel> same question applies.
[16:06:28] <sabotender> duch_kazatel: I am being more interactive than that.
[16:07:03] <duch_kazatel> i'd find it really annoying if a form was trying to validate on every character like that.
[16:07:11] <duch_kazatel> in fact, i do all ready.
[16:07:28] <sabotender> eh, it only changes the colour of the field, it doesn't show an actual error
[16:07:38] <duch_kazatel> that'd still be distracting to me.
[16:07:59] <sabotender> can't imagine why. its just an outline
[16:08:18] <duch_kazatel> you're telling me "wrong wronng wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong RIGHT!!!!"
[16:08:29] <duch_kazatel> seems funky
[16:09:08] <sabotender> I think its a whole lot better than waiting for the  user to finish the entire form just to tell the user that there are errors
[16:09:17] <duch_kazatel> that's why i'd do on blue.
[16:09:19] <duch_kazatel> *blur
[16:09:24] <duch_kazatel> wait until i'm done with the input.
[16:09:38] <sabotender> I considered that
[16:10:31] <sabotender> wait, i still have questions. so I bind the element that does not dynamically change?
[16:10:51] <sabotender> the only one that does not change is the container element
[16:10:51] <duch_kazatel> yes - $(parent).on('event', 'child', function(){});
[16:10:58] <duch_kazatel> the parent must exist at pageload, bind time, etc.
[16:11:12] <duch_kazatel> child can be your target that exists at any time.
[16:12:24] <sabotender> hmm that would allow me to combine this code into two functions instead of five...if it works, of course
[16:12:30] <duch_kazatel> it will.
[16:12:34] <duch_kazatel> if you do it right.
[16:13:14] <sabotender> well, let me see if I can make it happen. i will be back later
[16:15:41] <sabotender> $(parent).on('event', 'child', 'child', 'child', function(){});
[16:15:44] <sabotender> like that?
[16:16:14] <duch_kazatel>  $(parent).on('event', 'child1, child2, child3', function(){});
[16:16:32] <sabotender> right right
[16:39:07] <nights> hi guys
[16:39:25] <nights> im trying to create a fallback for an ajax set value operation
[16:39:54] <nights> if my call fail, i want to return my select to whatever it was before the user changed it (to properly reflect whats in server session)
[16:40:27] <nights> is there a jquery way to get a value before it get changed?
[16:42:08] <duch_kazatel> nights huh?
[16:42:16] <duch_kazatel> nights you'd have to store it somewhere.
[16:42:28] <duch_kazatel> jquery won't magically remember what the value "was"
[16:45:48] <nights> duch_kazatel: ok, just wanted to check before i do it the dull way
[16:46:12] <duch_kazatel> nights kay
[16:47:26] <HenryCH> if I do addClass('someclass') on an element that already has that class, could this cause any trouble?
[16:48:34] <duch_kazatel> nope.
[16:48:36] <duch_kazatel> it checks for you.
[16:48:59] <HenryCH> I'm doing this because, I have a toggleClass in my sidebar to show and remove subheadings as I click on the heading, but I'd like the subheadings to show by default when I go to that heading's page
[16:49:43] <HenryCH> so I was thinking of doing an addClass on the click event for that heading, but it could be that the subheadings are already showing
[16:50:05] <duch_kazatel> i avoid anything that toggles and manually manage my own addition and removal.
[16:50:06] <duch_kazatel> but meh.
[16:50:58] <HenryCH> oh ops since I'm going to a new page the element definitely won't have the class since it's never been toggled
[16:52:30] <duch_kazatel> bummer
[17:06:30] <bowenac> anyone good with each loops?
[17:07:01] <bowenac> having an issue figuring out how to write data for each div id on a click, I can write it for one but can't figure out how to do it for each div with an id
[17:07:17] <bowenac> like this jQuery('#clone_this').each(function() {    var tagtext = '[something][/something]'; })
[17:25:22] <shoky> wat
[17:47:51] <ankurk> I am using a jQuery file upload library, and that library when I upload file successfully, appends a hidden input field containing file's name as id. Now If I want to remove that hidden input with the appended <li> item, how would I do that?
[17:51:33] <ankurk> Loop through <li> list perhaps?
[17:51:44] <Shadowen773> Anyone have any suggestions why this 1.11 portion of code would lock up for ~10 seconds on my heroku production, but work perfectly in my dev? : eventHandle = elemData.handle = function( e ) {
[17:56:20] <cortexman> how do I uncheck all my jquery-ui checkboxes? —> not working:   $(":checkbox").removeAttr("checked")
[17:57:25] <raj> cortexman, $(":checkbox").prop('checked', false)
[17:57:45] <cortexman> i got this to work
[17:57:46] <cortexman> $("input:checkbox").prop("checked", false).button("refresh");
[17:59:44] <cortexman> here we go $(":checkbox").click(function(){$(":checkbox").prop("checked", false).button("refresh");})
[18:00:38] <raj> cortexman, use .on('click')
[18:01:06] <cortexman> why
[18:01:15] <raj> I think .click is deprecated
[18:03:21] <cortexman> seems fine
[18:04:28] <ankurk> Moreover, how would you guys validate input fields of this type?  <input name="userfile[]" type="file" />
[18:08:50] <bowenac> anyone around?
[18:09:13] <raj> always
[18:09:17] <bowenac> could someone look at this http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21394995/jquery-each-loop-write-data-for-each-div
[18:09:28] <bowenac> assuming someone here understands what I am asking
[18:10:51] <raj> bowenac, you have the answer there with .each()
[18:11:05] <bowenac> that is what I started with and its not working
[18:11:11] <bowenac> if I remove the each
[18:11:18] <bowenac> I can get return that value once
[18:11:45] <raj> how are you going to iterate over the clones without .each?
[18:11:54] <raj> maybe throw your code in jsfiddle so it can be edited live
[18:16:19] <trewd6> how can I get the element calling this: $(".required").focus(function () { }
[18:17:10] <raj> trewd6, what do you mean "element calling this"?
[18:17:23] <trewd6> raj: the element getting the focus
[18:17:58] <raj> `this`? :)
[18:18:15] <trewd6> raj: for some reason it does not work
[18:18:26] <raj> what's the code?
[18:18:45] <raj> what is the value of `this`?
[18:21:27] <trewd6> raj: this will not get me the jquery element it will get me the DOM element
[18:21:40] <raj> oh
[18:21:41] <raj> I see
[18:21:43] <raj> $(this)
[18:22:13] <jedimind> i can see clearly now the $(this) has fallen
[18:22:28] <raj> the rain is gone?
[18:27:11] <bowenac> raj sorry I had a call
[18:27:31] <bowenac> I was just explaining that it works without the each for one... but I can't figure out how to do that with the each as its not working
[18:27:43] <bowenac> It returns undefined when I use the each function
[18:28:05] <bowenac> The other persons example didn't make any sense to me and wasn't really what I was asking.
[18:28:56] <bowenac> he said to use $(v).html(); which I am not trying to get each div html, but write a specific string for each div
[18:34:13] <raj> bowenac, make a fiddle
[18:39:37] <raj> http://jsfiddle.net/BDjJb/
[18:40:14] <raj> http://jsfiddle.net/BDjJb/1/
[18:41:56] <bowenac> http://jsfiddle.net/bowenac/4xKvh/3/
[18:44:23] <bowenac> Does that make sense?
[18:44:40] <raj> it console.logs 4 times
[18:44:41] <raj> so?
[18:45:50] <bowenac> I get nothing
[18:46:05] <bowenac> where are you seeing any output
[18:46:12] <raj> console
[18:46:16] <raj> press f12
[18:46:18] <raj> in the browsre
[18:46:20] <raj> *browser
[18:47:22] <bowenac> yea I have firebug open
[18:47:26] <bowenac> and nothing is happening
[18:47:52] <raj> it says `[circlecounter][/circlecounter]`
[18:48:55] <bowenac> nm
[18:49:33] <bowenac> I guess my problem is somewhere else
[18:49:40] <bowenac> because I am trying to combine it with this var finish = start + tagtext + last;
[18:50:06] <bowenac> and then output finish which only outputs [start]undefined[last]
[18:50:30] <bowenac> when it should be [start][circlecounter][/circlecounter][circlecounter][/circlecounter][circlecounter][/circlecounter][last]
[18:50:41] <raj> don't see that in the fiddle
[18:51:23] <bowenac> http://jsfiddle.net/bowenac/4xKvh/4/
[18:51:26] <bowenac> updated
[18:56:12] <raj> bowenac, http://jsfiddle.net/4xKvh/5/
[18:56:25] <raj> you were overwriting your variables
[18:57:10] <ankurk> Anyone willing to put some light on this for me? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21395946/using-array-submission-syntax-in-html
[18:58:13] <bowenac> yea that is what I want to do
[18:58:20] <bowenac> why is there four?
[18:58:25] <bowenac> when there is only three divs
[18:58:38] <raj> there are 4 items with that class
[18:59:35] <raj> you may want to look into javascript before jquery
[19:00:59] <bowenac> lol nm copy paste etc
[19:01:01] <bowenac> thanks for the help
[19:03:55] <raj> did i just get duped into doing hw?
[19:09:48] <bowenac> no
[19:09:51] <bowenac> this isnt homework
[19:09:55] <bowenac> personal project wordpress theme
[19:10:25] <bowenac> first time I have used clone and couldn't figure out a way to print that value for each of the clones
[19:10:27] <bowenac> thanks
[19:17:35] <raj> lol, right
[19:19:53] <raj> where in the world are the docs on $.clone()?
[19:21:07] <obert> what is d?
[19:25:22] <systemfault> Didn't know .clone existed..
[19:25:40] <systemfault> It wouldn't make sense to duplicate .extend's functionality
[19:29:14] <raj> maybe just an alias?
[19:31:17] <raj> systemfault, what about merge?
[19:31:24] <raj> $.merge()
[19:31:33] <systemfault> Never heard of it.. again, it duplicates .extend
[19:32:50] <raj> why do neither docs mention the other!
[19:34:13] <systemfault> ?
[19:34:57] <systemfault> There's no .merge and no .clone AFAIK
[19:35:00] * sabotender sighs
[19:35:08] * jedimind hugs sabotender 
[19:35:10] <jedimind> it gets better
[19:35:12] <sabotender> I am unsure what to do next
[19:35:21] <sabotender> I did just as everyone suggested
[19:35:52] <sabotender> I set up this delegate, but it is ignoring the second field
[19:45:27] <sabotender> let's see here
[19:53:40] <sabotender> $(parent).on('event', 'child1, child2, child3', function(){});
[19:54:09] <sabotender> and it simply ignores all the childs after 'child1'
[20:00:29] <sabotender> I just confirmed that this method does not work; I swapped the element names around and the other one worked instead
[20:02:29] <jkoudys> I'm trying to use typeahead.js to have a typeahead box showing the suggestions in JSON from some service (in this case, http://janeswalk.org/api/walk_leaders?q=d ); typeahead.js works great when your dataset's defined according to their structure, but I can't figure out how to get it to display any alternate datasets
[20:03:32] <TrentonAdams> I'm curious.  jQuery seems to be wrapping my table row in another table row.  I'm atttempting to load data using the load() function, and it gets added to yet another row, even though the resulting html is a row itself.  e.g. jQuery('#time').append(jQuery('tr/>').load('url'));
[20:03:37] <jkoudys> I mostly just want it for its ability to set typing rate limits and cache results, but it's not useable unless I can get it to display arbitrary json. It seems better suited for when you want typeahead.js to search inside of the returned JSON, instead of just displaying that json (which is what I want to do)
[20:03:58] <jkoudys> is there something other than typeahead.js that might be a better fit?
[20:31:11] * sabotender BAHS in HORROR!
[20:31:46] <sabotender> okay so I can create a delegate, but I have to add them one at a time
[20:31:56] <sabotender> $(parent).on('event', 'child1, child2, child3', function(){}); does NOT work
[20:32:31] <sabotender> oh well, it works now
[20:35:07] <sabotender> fine fine, I retract my statement. it was my fault as I had a typo
[20:49:54] <tds5016> hi. how would I set position: absolute; left: -100000px on an svg element?
[20:49:59] <tds5016> using jquery?
[20:52:36] <jkoudys> how does one select based on a name attribute if that name has square brackets, e.g. <input name="name-last[]" />
[20:53:38] <jkoudys> n/m, just had to keep adding \ in front of them twice.. once is not enough apparently
[21:57:24] <scarlet_razor> hiii
[21:57:56] <scarlet_razor> why when i click back button in browser on firefox, the ajax respond is dissapear ?
[21:58:17] <scarlet_razor> how to prevent it, is there any scipt to prevent it ?
[22:14:32] <raj> is $.filter() an alias for $.grep()?
[22:16:22] <systemfault> No..
[22:16:28] <systemfault> .filter is for DOM nodes
[22:16:41] <systemfault> $.grep is like Array.prototype.filter
[22:16:53] <systemfault> Err
[22:16:56] <systemfault> Not even :/
[22:17:39] <systemfault> It's like Array.indexOf but more flexible.
[22:18:45] <scarlet_razor> sorry systemfault for asking u seem like u the only one who awake here... :D
[22:18:52] <scarlet_razor> when i click back button in firefox, it seems all the ajax fetching is dissapeared, is there any way to prevent this ?
[22:19:03] <lemonsparrow> how to save canvas as pdf instead of image ?   var image = canvas.toDataURL("image/png").replace("image/png", "image/octet-stream");
[22:19:39] <systemfault> Well, if your application doesn't use the HTML5 history API, I don't think there's any way unless you work with hashes
[22:36:47] <f0ster> can anyone tell me what is wrong with this simple ajax call? I can see in the network panel that is hitting the server and getting the JSON data back, but my success and done functions never call, https://gist.github.com/f0ster/8663171
[23:25:04] <buzzybron> can anyone explain this? jQuery('#Setup').button({'disabled':false}).click(function(){Array});
[23:28:29] <systemfault> Is there anything to explain?
[23:29:24] <systemfault> It creates a jQuery object from a DOM element having an ID of "setup", apply a "button" plugin to it... then add a click event handler to it
[23:29:35] <buzzybron> whats the array about?
[23:30:28] <systemfault> Looks like it's nothing.
[23:31:04] <buzzybron> the click handler is the 'disabled' : false part?
[23:31:25] <systemfault> it's the ".click" part
[23:32:00] <buzzybron> so the handler is empty? i mean i don't understand the Array which is found in the .click(fcuntion(){})
[23:36:47] <systemfault> buzzybron: The code has no effect.
[23:37:12] <systemfault> If it's exactly like this... it's doing nothing at all
