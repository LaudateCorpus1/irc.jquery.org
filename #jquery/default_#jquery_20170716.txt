[11:16:59] <thoraxe> foo = $.getJSON("/static/jsondata/foo2.json").responseJSON -- so, when I look at responseJSON in the console it's definitely a json object
[11:17:04] <thoraxe> but this results in "undefined"
[11:17:10] <thoraxe> well, it's an "object"
[11:20:24] <thoraxe> i essentially just want to return the remote json into another function
[11:22:06] <Woet> thoraxe: why would JSON not be an object?
[11:22:30] <thoraxe> I didn't say JSON wouldn't be an object.
[11:23:03] <thoraxe> all I know is that $.getJSON("/static/jsondata/foo2.json") 's responseJSON is an object that appears to be JSON, but trying to assign that to "foo" results in "undefined" in the console
[11:23:18] <thoraxe> I need that to be sync (not async) anyway... so perhaps ajax is better.
[11:24:55] <thoraxe> sigh, gotta go
[11:24:58] <thoraxe> will have to figure it out later

[14:31:27] <Braden`> !
[14:32:20] <Braden`> <div class="grid-item" id="a1" onclick="showContainer('a1, true);"> <-- I am trying to deal with that in a $(".grid-item").click(function() { ...   but how do I pass the paramaters/values a1 and true?
[14:32:32] <Braden`> I want to eliminate the onclick="" part of the code
[14:46:12] <Braden`> Anyone?

[22:46:28] <Braden`> Hello!
[22:46:49] <Braden`> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/aa44763dcf6211e2ee6172d4cb069455 <-- gridId is not being passed in the AJAX when the request is received on the PHP side
[22:46:54] <Braden`> What am I doing wrong?
