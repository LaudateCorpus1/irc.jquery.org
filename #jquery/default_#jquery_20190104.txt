[09:12:13] <anki1> Am using bootstap 3, Is it possible to change entire content of modal on ajax response ?
[10:26:20] <Guest58> hi
[10:26:23] <Guest58> anyone is here?
[10:44:27] <Guest58> what is logic about function order?
[10:44:39] <Guest58> in .scroll and .load and .resize for example?
[10:52:04] <jmg8766> I'm trying to understand promises better. Is there a nice pattern for $.ajax(..checkSomething..).then(..displayWarning..).done($.ajax(..perform action if user confirmed warning..)) ? is the best way to make a displayWarning function that takes and returns a promise rejecting it if the user clicks a cancel button?
[10:54:06] <Guest58> use .error
[10:54:09] <Guest58> and .success
[10:54:18] <Guest58> for status message
[10:56:48] <Guest58> if you use in a form then you can use required so untill not get filled cant submit
[10:56:59] <Guest58> with a warning message
[11:01:29] <Guest58> or use .is if element is not valid then
[11:55:50] <jmg8766> is there a way to pull the resolved value from a promise? $.when(promise).getValue()
[12:06:56] <jmg8766> nvrmind I figured out a way with plain javascript Promises
[15:21:30] <Es0teric> i have this https://kopy.io/AMUGy and each href id is linked to a slide... i want to add a border bottom to each of those navi items when the user is on the associated slide, how would I do that?
[16:21:15] <c_bluntish> hello, if I have a class "class1" and that has other classes eg "class2" how would I say on click on "class1" change css for first or next instance of "class2"?
[16:21:44] <c_bluntish> I meant div class1 has children of class2
[16:22:04] <c_bluntish> any help or pointers would be amazing TIA :)
[16:24:44] <shoky> $('.class1').on('click', function() { $(this).find('.class2').first().css(...) })    ?
[16:24:59] <shoky> donno what "first or next" means
[16:25:44] <c_bluntish> thank you so much
