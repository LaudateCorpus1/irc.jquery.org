[00:38:19] <sammych> in CSS, how would I shift a block level element up by 1x of it's own height?
[00:38:54] <Cork> shift it up?
[00:38:57] <sammych> negative margins aren't working as I hoped
[00:38:59] <Cork> you mean a negative margin?
[00:39:15] <Cork> position: relative; top: -1px; ?
[00:39:56] <sammych> like that, except with relative
[00:40:00] <sammych> i mean, %
[00:40:21] <sammych> don't want to used fixed element sizes
[00:40:29] <Cork> you would have to have a wrapper element for that
[00:40:50] <prohobo> this channel is useless
[00:41:21] <Cork> O_o
[00:41:23] <sammych> http://jsfiddle.net/347bqp0p/
[00:41:24] <Cork> lol
[00:41:39] <Cork> ahhh
[00:41:42] <Cork> tds
[00:41:47] <Cork> tds is not normal elements
[00:41:51] <sammych> hah
[00:41:54] <Cork> there is A LOT of restrictions there
[00:41:57] <sammych> what if I put divs inside them :D
[00:42:05] <Cork> that might help
[00:42:09] <systemfault> Cork: Well, he stayed a good minute and 21 seconds.
[00:42:13] <Cork> historically there has been problems with that too
[00:42:19] <Cork> systemfault: XD
[00:42:31] <sammych> okay, what if I just make the errorLabel a fixed em height
[00:42:45] <sammych> negative that
[00:42:50] <Cork> samhuntley: what exactly are you trying to do?
[00:43:08] <sammych> I wanna put validation messages in this little faux spreadsheet
[00:43:16] <Uhkis> systemfault: who? (got joins/quits ignored)
[00:43:31] <Cork> Uhkis: the prohobo comment
[00:43:42] <Uhkis> ooh
[00:43:48] <Uhkis> very useless indeed :-D
[00:44:18] <Cork> sammych: ok, so you want to move the "Enter a number" message to where?
[00:44:33] <sammych> pretty much this
[00:44:34] <sammych> http://jsfiddle.net/347bqp0p/1/
[00:44:41] <sammych> in fact, that's good enough for me
[00:44:47] <djam90> I am using insertAfter(element).slideDown(); in my code and it seems laggy and jittery. When I use just slideDown() it is smooth... is there any reason for that? My page is here: http://goo.gl/Y7y5m4
[00:45:07] <sammych> djam90: probably because it's sliding down everything
[00:45:17] <sammych> not just what you inserted
[00:45:21] <djam90> oh!
[00:45:24] <Cork> sammych: put the errorLabel inside the errorTag and it should be a bit simpler
[00:45:31] <workerbeetwo> Hi there.
[00:45:45] <workerbeetwo> How do I select class="x y" ?
[00:45:53] <Cork> workerbeetwo: .x.y
[00:46:05] <sammych> .Q.Q
[00:46:15] <Cork> as in $('.x.y')
[00:46:23] <sammych> Cork: but then that breaks the 100% width thing I have going on
[00:46:44] <sammych> which I kinda left out
[00:46:48] <Cork> sammych: 100% width thing?
[00:47:39] <sammych> http://jsfiddle.net/347bqp0p/2/
[00:47:47] <djam90> sammych, I changed it to stuff.insertAfter(element); stuff.slideDown() and it still goes laggy
[00:47:49] <sammych> that label only appears when you focus
[00:48:01] <Cork> white-space: nowrap?
[00:48:09] <sammych> djam90: you want element.slideDown()
[00:48:15] <sammych> oh
[00:48:18] <sammych> my bad
[00:48:31] <sammych> ignore me
[00:49:18] <sammych> I never use insertAfter, always after
[00:49:36] <sammych> depends on the chaining, though
[00:50:31] <stampz> hi
[00:50:39] <djam90> what is the difference between after and insertAfter
[00:50:58] <stampz> i want to add  a maxlength attribute to my editable input so when someone click and edit it , he cant type more than 50 chars
[00:50:59] <stampz> http://pastebin.com/NxeMwbVG
[00:51:01] <Cork> target.after(element)
[00:51:05] <Cork> element.insertAfter(target)
[00:51:09] <sammych> flipped
[00:51:35] <Cork> so
[00:51:46] <sammych> Cork: I'm gonna leave it as a separate element, mostly because the positioning is all annoying
[00:51:46] <Cork> $('<span>').insertAfter('#foo')
[00:51:59] <Cork> $('#foo').after('<span>')
[00:52:16] <workerbeetwo> Cork: thanks
[00:52:18] <sammych> actually, never mind, it's all good actually
[00:52:27] <Cork> samhuntley: well bottom: 100%; should make what you want a bit simpler if it is a child
[00:52:36] <Cork> *sammych:
[00:52:57] <sammych> hmm, no dice
[00:53:28] <sammych> probably because the triangle is a zero height object
[00:54:07] <sammych> never mind, I'll take my other way. 'good enough'
[00:54:26] <sammych> thanks, Cork
[00:54:30] <Cork> np
[00:56:55] <djam90> sammych, the code that runs when I click a car is here: http://pastebin.com/LtZEZP81  you think there is anything causing the animation blocking here: http://goo.gl/Y7y5m4
[01:00:07] <sammych> Cork: here you go http://jsfiddle.net/347bqp0p/3/
[01:01:12] <Cork> samhuntley: you might actually be able to do this without js :)
[01:01:36] <Cork> with tabindex="0" and :active
[01:01:44] <sammych> hmm
[01:02:00] <sammych> oh yeah
[01:02:28] <sammych> don't need tabindex?
[01:02:48] <Cork> depends if you can focus the element
[01:02:57] <Cork> normal elements can't have focus normally
[01:03:02] <sammych> it's an input
[01:03:10] <Cork> ah...
[01:03:22] <sammych> hence 'spreadsheet'
[01:03:33] <Cork> lol i didn't even notice XD
[01:03:42] <Cork> but yes
[01:03:52] <Cork> if you move the position absolute element to the end of the element
[01:04:14] <Cork> you can do it with input:active (or :focus) + .errorLable
[01:04:14] <sammych> css siblings?
[01:04:18] <sammych> yeah
[01:04:38] <Cork> prob focus
[01:05:03] <Macaveli> I have only the path "/user/profile/remove" is it possible to navigate to that path using jQuery
[01:05:22] <Cork> Macaveli: window.location = "/user/profile/remove"
[01:06:57] <Macaveli> you don't need the "www.google.com" part for example?
[01:07:26] <Cork> no
[01:07:35] <Cork> urls is relative if you leave out the domain
[01:07:53] <Cork> or rather they are absolute without the domain
[01:08:06] <Cork> and relative without the leading /
[01:08:14] <Cork> and complete with the domain
[01:08:24] <Cork> (and protocol relative with //:)
[01:08:29] <Macaveli> thanks!
[01:08:33] <Macaveli> I will try to get it
[01:08:56] <sammych> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/347bqp0p/5/
[01:09:00] <sammych> it is finished?
[01:09:21] <Cork> nice!
[01:09:55] <Cork> i would prob just do isNaN(el.val()) though
[01:10:02] <Cork> and remove the v variable
[01:10:06] <sammych> eh
[01:10:13] <heythere> hey brothers, so I got 2 sections. I want to make it so each time I am in each of the sections their title becomes fixed on top. Any ideas? I came with something like http://jsfiddle.net/La19d6hm/ which is hideous but the offset makes it so I need to scroll further down in the section to actually get the right title to go on top.
[01:10:22] <sammych> too many parens
[01:11:03] <Cork> heythere: so you want sticky headers
[01:11:11] <Cork> heythere: modern browsers support this natively
[01:11:22] <Cork> and you could look for a lib to do it for you
[01:11:40] <Cork> ?g mdn position sticky
[01:11:41] <sammych> i'd like sticky headers with tables
[01:11:41] <b-ot> Cork: position - CSS | MDN → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/position
[01:11:51] <Cork> sammych: it exists
[01:12:02] <sammych> IE11?
[01:12:03] <Cork> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/position#Sticky_positioning
[01:12:16] <Cork> samhuntley: ff32 :)
[01:12:17] <Macaveli> Thanks Cork the code wasn't working because I forgot the " round the rails_path
[01:12:21] <Cork> and safari
[01:12:36] <Cork> meaning the next version of firefox
[01:12:38] <sammych> I'm building a hybrid app for touch
[01:12:46] <sammych> and Win8.1
[01:12:53] <sammych> so, IE11
[01:12:55] <Cork> no
[01:12:58] <Cork> ah
[01:12:59] <Cork> sorry
[01:13:04] <heythere> I've looked around couldnt find anything that suits me <: actually cork I want to make that section sticky. So I got a <section/> <div/> <section/> <div/> the section has a class that makes it something like a banner, and id like it so when I am in each div it becomes fixed
[01:13:08] <sammych> yeah there are libs, though
[01:13:37] <Cork> ?g jquery sticky headers
[01:13:37] <b-ot> Cork: jmosbech/StickyTableHeaders · GitHub → https://github.com/jmosbech/StickyTableHeaders
[01:13:58] <Cork> though ya you can write it your self it isn't super hard
[01:14:10] <Cork> (i have a few implementations laying around here)
[01:15:03] <heythere> hmm here: http://jsfiddle.net/La19d6hm/1/ is my example, I just wanted that green bar to become the header when ur on it
[01:15:10] <heythere> i mean under it
[01:15:27] <sammych> I've made it myself...with difficulty
[01:15:38] <sammych> but it was really a clone thead
[01:15:54] <Cork> ugg
[01:15:58] <sammych> which was all sort of terribleness
[01:16:04] <heythere> the problem I am having with this code is that with the offset you need to scroll further down, well I am not a jquery expert :( thats why am asking for some help :)
[01:16:09] <Cork> heythere: base it on classes and you could clean it up a lot
[01:16:24] <Cork> also move the css out of the js
[01:16:28] <Cork> it doesn't belong there
[01:16:46] <djam90> I have this animation: http://pastebin.com/dXidn5sm  and it does the scrolling but the complete function doesn't work after?
[01:17:21] <heythere> cork now am comfused hehe:)
[01:18:25] <Cork> heythere: give the elements a class sticky-candidate or something
[01:18:38] <heythere> ok yes I saw it ther eis a library
[01:18:40] <Cork> on scroll loop them and check for the one that should be sticky
[01:18:44] <heythere> stickyjs
[01:18:47] <Cork> and set a sticky class on it
[01:18:49] <heythere> i could use that
[01:18:59] <Cork> and you shouldn't need all the hardcoded things you have there now
[01:19:04] <heythere> but now my question is, how do I found out that user is using the section
[01:19:22] <Cork> heythere: depends on what you mean by using
[01:19:28] <heythere> like if(user is in that section) sticky
[01:19:37] <heythere> i mean scrolling on that section
[01:19:40] <Cork> again depends on what you mean by "in that section"
[01:19:53] <Cork> find what section is in view you mean?
[01:20:01] <sammych> phew, thanks again Cork. Tomorrow, integration!
[01:20:22] <heythere> yes so lets say we have a <section id='hi'><div></div></section
[01:20:32] <heythere> when user is within that section hi
[01:20:51] <Cork> $('section').filter(function() { return $(this).position().top > 0 && $(this).position().top < window.innerHeight })
[01:20:55] <heythere> then do that or if he is not viewing that section do something else
[01:21:02] <Cork> window.innerHeight is wrong but i don't remeber the name
[01:21:11] <Cork> window.maxY ?
[01:21:26] <heythere> can i do it by id thought?
[01:21:39] <Cork> heythere: then you would have to have one code snippet per id
[01:21:45] <djam90> If I want to scroll the page to an element scrollTop, do I do $('html, body').animate({ or just html, or just body?
[01:21:49] <Cork> learn to write dynamic code
[01:21:57] <Cork> meaning it works with what the page uses
[01:22:08] <Cork> instead of only a specific element
[01:22:22] <Cork> it makes much easier to maintain code
[01:22:37] <Cork> as you don't have to update it for every small change that happens (a new section is added)
[01:23:01] <sammych> I'm a bit anal, but I see "$(this)" twice up there...
[01:23:10] <sammych> in the same scope *gasp*
[01:23:14] <Cork> djam90: you need html and body if i remember correctly
[01:23:35] <heythere> ok thanks Cork ill try and see how far it goes
[01:23:39] <djam90> Cork, I am using animate and I think it fires for both selectors in Chrome? So it is running the complete function TWICE
[01:24:43] <Cork> djam90: if i remember correctly webkit uses body and trident and gecko uses window
[01:24:48] <Cork> (aka html)
[01:25:01] <Cork> but i might remember wrong
[01:25:22] <djam90> Cork, I think you are right. But in Chrome, it is doing the complete function twice for the animation
[01:25:31] <Cork> djam90: ok?
[01:25:34] <Cork> so handle it
[01:25:37] * sammych loves his little spreadsheet
[01:26:44] <sammych> don't know if it's just Chrome or Webkit...you need the space before and after the oper in css calc()
[01:29:24] <Cork> sammych: i'm quite sure it is by spec
[01:31:07] <Cork> sammych: http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css-values/#calc-syntax
[01:31:14] <Cork> "In addition, whitespace is required on both sides of the + and - operators. (The * and / operaters can be used without whitespace around them.)"
[01:32:00] <sammych> figures
[01:32:11] <sammych> thanks for making that plainly obvious
[01:32:49] <sammych> seeing as I have your attention, jsfiddle has some really annoying content containment issues
[01:35:12] <pando_> Hi, I want to find a specific '<script type="text/javascript">' inside my page, how can I do this ??
[01:35:23] <Cork> pando_: why would you need to??
[01:35:45] <Cork> pando_: simplest is prob to give the script and id
[01:35:48] <Cork> and=an
[01:36:02] <pando_> inside the tag, there is a var that is dynamically defined and I have to get that
[01:36:13] <pando_> there is no id so that's the problem :)
[01:36:16] <sammych> uh oh
[01:36:27] <Cork> pando_: are you running scripts for the page?
[01:36:35] <Cork> meaning do you actually run the scripts in the page?
[01:36:41] <pando_> no i am scraping the page
[01:36:54] <pando_> and I want to get that dynamically defined var
[01:37:02] <pando_> It changes on every load
[01:37:02] <Cork> you could do something like $('script')
[01:37:05] <Cork> and loop the results
[01:37:11] <pando_> oh ok ?
[01:37:14] <pando_> that easy ``
[01:37:14] <Cork> and check if the script tag contains the variable name
[01:37:17] <pando_> ?
[01:37:22] <pando_> yeah thtats what I wanted to do
[01:37:25] <Cork> in text format that is
[01:37:31] <pando_> loop over all script tags and look if its inside
[01:37:34] <Cork> regex is prob your best option
[01:37:45] <pando_> I am VERY noobish at rege
[01:37:45] <pando_> x
[01:37:50] <Cork> pando_: or just regex the entire html content
[01:38:00] <pando_> hmm
[01:38:01] <sammych> match
[01:38:29] <pando_> the line is like 'var a = 68306;'
[01:38:37] <pando_> so I have to look for var a =
[01:38:39] <pando_> and get the number
[01:38:46] <sammych> is it always at a specific line?
[01:38:47] <Cork> html.match(/var your_variable_name = ([^;]+);/)[1]
[01:38:49] <pando_> yeah
[01:38:54] <sammych> you could do split('\n')
[01:39:14] <sammych> that *might* work?
[01:39:53] <Cork> js> print('<html><body><script>var a = 68306;</script></body></html>'.match(/var your_variable_name = ([^;]+);/)[1])
[01:40:04] <b-ot> Cork: No output.
[01:40:20] <Cork> lol
[01:40:24] <pando_> :)
[01:40:30] <Cork> js> print('<html><body><script>var a = 68306;</script></body></html>'.match(/var a = ([^;]+);/)[1])
[01:40:39] <b-ot> Cork: 68306
[01:41:53] <pando_> I think I'll have to up my regex skill :>
[01:42:08] <pando_> lemme try and see if I can get it to work
[01:43:00] <Uhkis> well that's a simple one :-)
[01:43:26] <Cork> ya
[01:52:12] <pando_> thanks guys this helped me a lot. I am not done , but I think this would have taken some time without you
[01:53:50] <Uhkis> but this channel was supposed to be useless.. :-D
[01:54:29] <Cork> Uhkis: sssh, don't tell time, he might not notice ;)
[02:04:57] <djam90> I am using $(document).animate( and I am getting error Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'defaultView' of null
[02:05:39] <Cork> djam90: not sure you can't animate document as it isn't a real dom element
[02:05:47] <djam90> oh I see
[02:05:51] <Cork> try document.documentElement
[02:06:14] <djam90> Cork I read that you can replace $('html, body').animate with $(document) to make it work better
[02:06:31] <Cork> djam90: i don't think that is correct
[02:06:38] <djam90> ohh
[02:07:11] <djam90> Cork that removed the error but now the animation to scroll the browser doesn't work
[02:08:22] <frank_o> Cork: Hi! Yesterday when you mentioned svg > html didn't bubble correctly, is that an intentional feature or a bug that'll eventually get fixed?
[02:09:33] <Cork> frank_o: they are looking into actually moving svg into html (in the spec)
[02:09:45] <Cork> but currently svg is a separate document in the browser
[02:09:50] <Cork> even when it is embeded
[02:10:06] <Cork> so there is a lot of weirdities there
[02:10:25] <Cork> frank_o: so, yes it is intentional "by the spec"
[02:10:38] <Cork> and yes it is a bug "in how the spec specifies it"
[02:11:00] <frank_o> hehe
[02:11:21] <frank_o> cool, yes and no and no and yes :)
[02:11:22] <djam90> Cork, so how would I handle the complete function running twice because of html,body ?
[02:11:22] <Cork> and with a bit of luck they are going to create a new svg spec that is actually built around normal dom instead of svg dom
[02:11:36] <Cork> djam90: set a variable and check if it is set to true?
[02:11:39] <frank_o> lets bet on that then
[02:11:42] <frank_o> thanks Cork
[02:11:55] <computer2000> this may not be really js related but anyway: anyone knows if the autocomplete="no" form attribute still works across current browsers?
[02:12:07] <Cork> djam90: or use $.when(.animate()).then
[02:12:31] <Cork> computer2000: yes, it has actually been moved into the spec
[02:12:35] <djam90> $.when. never heard of that! wow
[02:12:40] <Cork> (was propriatary ie from the start)
[02:12:51] <Cork> ?g site:api.jquery.com when
[02:12:56] <b-ot> Cork: jQuery.when() | jQuery API Documentation → http://api.jquery.com/jquery.when/
[02:13:24] <Cork> djam90: .then gives you a callback when all the callbacks is fired
[02:13:29] <Cork> so that should give you what you want
[02:13:33] <Cork> ?g site:api.jquery.com then
[02:13:34] <b-ot> Cork: deferred.then() | jQuery API Documentation → http://api.jquery.com/deferred.then/
[02:13:45] <djam90> Cork that is AWESOME
[02:14:07] <frank_o> Cork is awesome
[02:14:18] <frank_o> :-)
[02:14:26] <djam90> like the example? sorry for 2 lines but: $.when( $.ajax( "/page1.php" ), $.ajax( "/page2.php" ) ).then( myFunc, myFailure );
[02:14:31] <djam90> oo not 2 lines :)
[02:14:33] <krz> how do i do something like this $('input[name=plan[reason_for_unsubscribe]]')
[02:14:46] <krz> the name of the input is plan[reason_for_unsubscribe]
[02:15:46] <Cork> krz: quote the attribute value
[02:15:57] <krz> example?
[02:16:03] <Cork> always, always ALWAYS quote the attribute values in selectors
[02:16:10] <Cork> $('input[name="plan[reason_for_unsubscribe]"]')
[02:16:22] <krz> ty

[03:16:23] <stampz> thanks frickettz  ! : http://jsfiddle.net/a4cqv652/10/  is it also possible to display a message ?
[03:16:31] <stampz> just below the input
[03:17:23] <frickettz> stamps:  it is, sure.  Look into the .append() function.  There are some other ways to accomplish that too but .append() should get you started.
[03:17:58] <frickettz> you can append a message to your .form-group div
[03:20:35] <frickettz> stampz* that is
[03:35:35] <hxm> morning guys, i have this https://www.dropbox.com/s/bbqmzzsnxr5lwgb/Captura%20de%20pantalla%202014-08-13%2012.20.22.png and i cant make scroll down, i cant see the full chart and the console log says this: 'Range.detach' is now a no-op, as per DOM (http://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#dom-range-detach). is it related?
[03:39:35] <CodesStuff> hxm: hmm.. try adding some padding to the bottom of the body
[03:39:42] <CodesStuff> See if that fixed anything at all
[03:40:36] <hxm> i added padding-bottom:10px; at the container but does nothing, i cant scroll down or up
[03:41:27] <CodesStuff> Odd. Is that jquery ui?
[03:41:44] <hxm> is jquery with bootstrap
[03:41:58] <hxm> the problem comes with the highcharts library tought
[03:42:02] <CodesStuff> Are your containers overlapping?
[03:42:07] <hxm> hm
[03:42:10] <CodesStuff> Sometimes I get that issue with bootstrap too
[03:42:30] <CodesStuff> Check source for red tags, or do a 3d inspection of the DOM
[03:42:50] <CodesStuff> Just out of curiosity, is that a twitter follow/unfollow bot?
[03:42:51] <hxm> in google chrome i dont see the red tags, is that a feature i can enable or is just firefox?
[03:43:09] <hxm> has that feature, but is not that made for that
[03:43:12] <CodesStuff> I only use Firefox, and it usually lets me know when the tags are messed up
[03:43:31] <CodesStuff> I see. I'll pm you one of my repos - you might get some use out of it.
[04:04:02] <vanhin> How can I use the "Attribute Starts With Selector" to look inside a class?

[04:13:08] <CodesStuff> oh wait
[04:13:12] <CodesStuff> this is #jquery
[04:13:17] <CodesStuff> nevermind. I'm retarded
[04:14:27] <hxm> CodesStuff: thanks, it worked, i had a overflow: hidden somewhere
[04:15:26] <CodesStuff> hxm: Damn those sneaky rules
[04:17:21] <hxm> yea
[04:17:40] <vanhin> CodesStuff, I need that in Jquery... i'm missing the syntax
[04:19:21] <vanhin> m1su, I need to access "lottery" classes like you mentioned... but they are inside another classes. I need to first go to class "parent" to be certain that those are the correct lotteries
[04:19:41] <vanhin> there are other parents with other lotteries
[04:21:57] <m1su> vanhin: do you want to get all the elements inside .parent with a class starting like lottery?
[04:22:14] <vanhin> m1su, Yes
[04:22:17] <m1su> vanhin: or do you need the actual classes of those elements?
[04:22:29] <m1su> $('.parent div[class^="lottery"]')
[04:22:36] <m1su> should work fine then
[04:23:28] <RiskyShenanigan> any bower users here/

[04:28:51] <samnabi> Hey all, I'm trying to customize the jQuery Mobile rangeslider. What's the best way to build a buffer into the normalize event? http://api.jquerymobile.com/rangeslider/#event-normalize
[04:30:08] <samnabi> e.g. the two slider handles should never be closer than 5 units
[04:30:48] <samnabi> Right now they're allowed to overlap, but min can't exceed max...
[04:39:29] <phx> hello
[04:39:55] <phx> could someone please help? i'm trying to select the second input box and apply a few things to it, however i'm unable to do so: http://jsfiddle.net/vtoah4t5/4/
[04:40:34] <phx> i either get nothing, or if i use simply input[type=list] then i get the first one. i've tried input#foobar, input[id=foobar], giving it a name then input[name=foobar], but that one never gets selected
[04:45:16] <stampz> thanks frickettz  ! :  http://jsfiddle.net/kirua_sama/a4cqv652/12/  : how do  i remove the appended div when the characters number is not equal to max length ?
[04:47:50] <frickettz> $('.editable-error-block.help-block').remove();
[04:48:21] <frickettz> help-block is a class so you need the dot before it, just like .editable-error-block
[04:48:32] <frickettz> stampz*
[04:52:36] <stampz> thanks frickettz  ! :  http://jsfiddle.net/kirua_sama/a4cqv652/13/   now how to make sure the append div containint the message is only appended once even if the user tries to keep typing when limit reached
[04:57:03] <phx> anyone could help with my input box selector problem please? http://jsfiddle.net/vtoah4t5/4/ i can't get it to select the second input box on js line 28
[04:57:46] <frickettz> stampz:  just before the line where you are appending your message, add:  $('.editable-error-block').remove();
[04:58:02] <frickettz> http://jsfiddle.net/a4cqv652/14/
[04:58:37] <frickettz> so it removes the previous one before adding a new one
[05:09:58] <doge_wow> Hallow! I get an error message that this file is not found: jquery-1.10.2.min.map. Where can I download this file? I've been looking with Google and jQuery website, but can't find it. For example, it's not here: http://code.jquery.com or here: http://jquery.com/download
[05:10:09] <Cork> phx: http://jsfiddle.net/vtoah4t5/5/
[05:10:22] <Cork> cause w2layout adds the element async
[05:10:30] <Cork> you need to look for a callback from the plugin
[05:10:47] <Cork> (the setTimeout is a hack and should N-O-T be used as a solution)
[05:11:17] <Cork> doge_wow: the file is referenced at the top of the .min.js file
[05:11:26] <Cork> just use the relative url to fetch it
[05:11:35] <phx> Cork, thanks
[05:11:46] <phx> Cork, any idea where/how should i look for a possibility for a callback?
[05:12:09] <Cork> phx: read the documentation
[05:12:15] <Cork> if there isn't one, read the plugins code
[05:12:23] <phx> Cork, you mean w2ui, right?
[05:12:30] <Cork> yes
[05:12:33] <phx> thanks
[05:13:29] <Cork> doge_wow: ex. http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.10.2.min.js => //@ sourceMappingURL=jquery-1.10.2.min.map
[05:13:30] <Cork> http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.10.2.min.map
[05:13:58] <tuskkk___> Hello, even if I have server side validation on register.php, is it worth doing client side validation using JS, jQuery? If yes, how is it done?
[05:14:12] <Cork> doge_wow: or update to jquery 1.11 it doesn't use sourceMappingURL
[05:14:48] <tuskkk___> Plus I need to learn jQuery pretty quickly, any recommended resources except for codeacedemy?
[05:14:54] <Cork> tuskkk___: you can make the validation experience more rappid and nicer with js validation
[05:15:03] <Cork> but you should ALWAYS do the same validation server side
[05:15:39] <tuskkk___> Yep, server side validation is top notch, I need something on client side too, if necessary
[05:15:59] <doge_wow> Cork: oki, thnx!! I never heard of map files... have to look into that.
[05:16:14] <Cork> doge_wow: it is a deminification map
[05:16:35] <Cork> it is used in the browsers developer tools to show the uncompressed original source
[05:16:57] <Cork> tuskkk___: you can have a look at jquery.validation.js
[05:16:58] <doge_wow> Cork: is it necessary to run jQuery? If you omit it, will everything work normally?
[05:17:03] <Cork> *jquery-validation.js
[05:17:13] <tuskkk___> Ok
[05:17:20] <Cork> doge_wow: no, the warning is from the browser trying to fetch the .map file
[05:17:25] <Cork> it isn't a js error
[05:17:57] <Cork> doge_wow: but the unminification feature in the browser doesn't work without it
[05:18:15] <Cork> so you will get !function(a,b){"object"==typeof module&&"object"==typeof module.exports?module..... in source view
[05:18:41] <Cork> instead of (function( global, factory ) {.....

[05:22:06] <ProjectBarks> I understand what the exception means
[05:22:07] <doge_wow> Cork: oh oki, thnx
[05:22:12] <ProjectBarks> but cant figureout what causes it
[05:31:36] <farid> Hi there.. i have a small question.. i am doing an ajax as a resut of which i get a number .. which i assign to a variable type_id ... how can i access it out side ajax call.
[05:33:11] <davetarmac> hey folks o/
[05:33:34] <phx> Cork, i've added a $(document).on('load', 'input' ,'', function(e) {console.log(e);});, but it never gets called. shouldn't this bind an event handler on the document root, and catching my input element when it loads?
[05:33:40] <davetarmac> I'm using jQuery to handle focus events, but KnockoutJS to handle paging and data binding.
[05:34:01] <Cork> phx: input doesn't fire load events so why would it?
[05:34:05] <davetarmac> I've got this script http://pastebin.com/3byFdff3 which works great on the first page, but doesn't work on the 2nd page
[05:34:12] <phx> Cork, oh, i had no idea for that
[05:34:24] <Cork> phx: there is no events for elements added to the page
[05:34:25] <davetarmac> I'm sure it's something to do with the html changing, but can't for the life of me fix it
[05:34:35] <Cork> only the plugin can help you if it supports that
[05:35:01] <farid> i am doing an ajax as a resut of which i get a number .. which i assign to a variable type_id ... how can i access it out side ajax call.
[05:35:09] <phx> Cork, it might not, i'm afraid. so i'm looking after something that can help me here
[05:35:23] <Cork> phx: there isn't really anything that can
[05:35:53] <Cork> farid: short answer; no
[05:36:21] <Cork> long answer yes, as long as the code trying to access it runs after the ajax response has executed
[05:36:44] <Cork> (meaning you need to check from ex. an event handler)
[05:36:57] <farid> ok
[05:37:00] <Cork> farid: ajax gives you deferred handlers
[05:37:02] <Cork> use those instead
[05:37:25] <farid> let me google that.. thanks
[05:37:30] <Cork> then you can do function c() { return $.ajax(); }  c().done(function(data) {})
[05:38:01] <Cork> or var something = c(); ............................. something.done(function(data) {})
[05:38:56] <farid> interesting.. that makes more sence

[05:56:51] <jnhghy> hi, I'd like to set the focus on a li element is it possible? is it possible via jquery? or javascript or css? or html ? :) the element gets focus when tab key is pressed but I found no css style chagnes (the li is a nav element, it has a href in it)
[06:00:06] <Cork> jnhghy: if the element is a form element or an <a> link it can have focus by default
[06:00:19] <Cork> lis need to have tabindex="0" to be able to take focus
[06:01:37] <jnhghy> Cork: is a navigation element, not form... it doesn't have a tabindex but tab key cause an focus to it ... o.O
[06:02:15] <Cork> jnhghy: then it must have an <a> inside it
[06:02:23] <Cork> cause you can't focus a plain <li> element
[06:03:44] <jnhghy> Cork: yap it does, it has an <a> element, I'll try to make a focus on that...
[06:13:00] <Forbidd3n> Anyone know of a good script tutorial for an ajax progress bar updating from php script being called via ajax?
[06:20:27] <krambiorix> hi, on opening a dialog i have some code to perform, when i change something later on in the dialog content , i want to call the dialog.open again without reopening the dialog... Is that possible?
[06:27:48] <ProjectBarks> Would someone mind helping me with a QUnit issue.
[06:32:24] <phx> Cork, if you remember my issue with the async load with w2ui, could you please give me any hints where/what should i look for? i've tried onRefresh/onRender event handlers, and when those reported that the contents are there i've ran my .w2field bind, but still nothing happened
[06:33:03] <Cork> phx: i would start by looking for a callback feature from the plugin
[06:33:37] <Cork> something like w2ui({ ... loaded: function() {}}) or similar
[06:33:51] <Cork> or the code might do something like elm.trigger or elm._trigger
[06:33:57] <Cork> (fake dom event)
[06:34:10] <ProjectBarks> ...
[06:40:38] <wiherek> hi, i have an issue with ui sortable
[06:40:48] <wiherek> it regards scrolling.
[06:41:16] <wiherek> it seems that it only scrolls when the elemented that is being sorted reaches body's edge
[06:41:27] <wiherek> not the edge of the viewPort
[06:41:28] <Forbidd3n> Anyone know of a good script tutorial for an ajax progress bar updating from php script being called via ajax?
[06:41:51] <Forbidd3n> I can't seem to figure out how to check the script with another ajax call to same script
[06:42:03] <Cork> wiherek: should work if you change container for the overlay
[06:43:06] <wiherek> so something like .sortable('option', 'containment', ??)
[06:43:17] <Cork> wiherek: http://api.jqueryui.com/sortable/#option-containment
[06:43:30] <Cork> Forbidd3n: each connection is separate in php
[06:43:31] <wiherek> should I change it to body?
[06:43:45] <Cork> so you don't really have a structure to send the process data back
[06:44:21] <BillCriswell> Why do I torture myself on SO.
[06:44:59] <Cork> Forbidd3n: you can have a getprogress.php that checks the size of the file on disk
[06:45:08] <Cork> and from that sends back a progress state
[06:45:29] <Forbidd3n> Cork: what do you mean size of file on disk?
[06:45:43] <Forbidd3n> not uploading if you are referring to that
[06:46:10] <Cork> Forbidd3n: what are you doing progress from then?
[06:46:35] <Cork> ya, i assumed you talked about upload progress
[06:47:46] <Forbidd3n> I have link when clicked does ajax call to script, script starts downloading and importing listings from a remote url. I need to show the progress of this so the user sees something occurring. It downloads image and imports content into db so it takes a few minutes.
[06:47:51] <Forbidd3n> Need to show script progress
[06:49:09] <Forbidd3n> flush isn't sending content back in my php script
[06:50:53] <wiherek> Cork, what should I change the containment to?
[06:50:59] <wiherek> it's body by default
[06:51:09] <Cork> wiherek: no it is false by default
[06:51:59] <Cork> wiherek: if that doesn't help i don't know what's going wrong
[06:52:46] <Cork> wiherek: but sortable should scroll the element that is the containment
[06:53:01] <wiherek> yea
[06:53:30] <Forbidd3n> Cork: possible?
[06:53:55] <wiherek> it only starts scrolling when I get to the edge of body
[06:54:29] <wiherek> but not the edge of the screen
[06:54:36] <wiherek> the edge of body is way below.
[06:54:43] <Cork> Forbidd3n: ajax doesn't really support push data
[06:55:18] <Cork> Forbidd3n: the data the browser has is delivered to the script when the server closes the connection
[06:55:36] <Cork> if you want to push data you should look at using websocket instead
[06:55:40] <Forbidd3n> hmm, there has to be some sort of way I would think
[06:55:58] <Cork> Forbidd3n: not that is cross browser and isn't leaking memory
[06:56:43] <Forbidd3n> maybe setting a session in the ajax script and updating the session variable and then call another script through ajax every second to check the sessin percentage done?
[06:57:00] <Cork> sure
[06:57:27] <Cork> but i talked about sending data in the open connection
[07:04:16] <Forbidd3n> to run a function every 5 seconds best to use setTimeout or setInterval
[07:04:52] <Woet> which of the two sounds more suited for the job?
[07:05:53] <Woet> also, googling "setTimeout vs setInterval" has a /lot/ of information.
[07:08:11] <Cork> Forbidd3n: no always use setTimeout
[07:08:22] <Cork> setInterval has a big risk for race
[07:08:37] <Forbidd3n> how do you clear the timeout
[07:08:40] <Cork> where the timer runs up on you and you end up with constant running code
[07:08:42] <Forbidd3n> if I have it in a recursive function
[07:09:00] <Cork> var handle = setTimeout()
[07:09:05] <Cork> clearTimeout(handle)
[07:09:07] <Forbidd3n> thanks
[07:12:35] <krambiorix> I add a table to a div coming from ajax. I have a button that adds a new row to that table. Before refreshing the table with ajax and pressing the button, the row has been added. After refresh it doesn't add a row anymore... i use $(row).insertBefore("#"+$(this).data('id')+"_"+z+" > tbody > tr:first"); ... What could be the problem?
[07:12:37] <Forbidd3n> Cork: does this look right?
[07:12:38] <Forbidd3n> http://pastebin.com/KNTrv0Dd
[07:16:29] <Cork> Forbidd3n: looks ok
[07:16:45] <stampz> ~logs
[07:16:53] <Cork> Forbidd3n: oh, wait no
[07:17:04] <Cork> Forbidd3n: your doing the exact same problem that setInterval would do
[07:17:16] <Forbidd3n> I am going with setInterval
[07:17:18] <Cork> Forbidd3n: you want to do the setTimeout in the success callback not in the updateProcess
[07:17:35] <Forbidd3n> I need it to call my function over an over until it is completed and I am then clearing the interval id
[07:17:36] <Cork> Forbidd3n: setInterval is a REALLY bad idea for code that uses network
[07:17:50] <Cork> if you get a 2second network delay
[07:18:03] <Forbidd3n> not if I clear it, correct?
[07:18:08] <Cork> your scrip will run over it self and start firing multiple ajax calls at once
[07:18:10] <Cork> no
[07:18:13] <Cork> doesn't matter
[07:18:34] <Cork> 1. update is called, it queues an ajax call, 2. setTimeout is queued for 2s
[07:18:44] <Cork> 3. setTimeout fires 2s later
[07:18:51] <Forbidd3n> ok, what is the best way to get an function to run until I clear it on success function
[07:19:20] <Cork> Forbidd3n: no the best solution is to move the timeout into the success callback
[07:19:29] <Forbidd3n> so setTimeout in second ajax call success
[07:19:34] <Cork> cause the you always have 2 seconds between each time you request an answer
[07:19:52] <Cork> instead of 2 seconds since a connection was atemted
[07:20:01] <Cork> you can effectively dos your server with this code
[07:20:52] <Cork> Forbidd3n: have a global function (or at least one not defined in the updateProcees function)
[07:21:03] <Cork> and in the success callback queue a new call to updateProcess
[07:21:05] <Forbidd3n> can you give me a simple example please?
[07:22:11] <wa5ted> yo was up #jquery
[07:22:34] <Cork> Forbidd3n: http://pastebin.com/rN78nDXf
[07:23:22] <Cork> Forbidd3n: or you could use complete: function() { handle = setTimeout(updateProgress, 2000); } to handle both success and error
[07:25:02] <zeroquake> hello , which one is the preferable one to use for condition checking ....             boolean vs string vs integer   ?
[07:25:29] <Cork> zeroquake: uh, for true/false use use boolean
[07:25:42] <CrashTes1Dummy73> Hello. jQuery is working but $ does not.
[07:25:45] <Cork> why would you ever use anything else?
[07:26:04] <Cork> CrashTes1Dummy73: you most likely have another lib grabbing the $ variable
[07:26:14] <CrashTes1Dummy73> Cork: Prototype?
[07:26:17] <Cork> yes
[07:26:23] <Cork> that would be an example
[07:26:26] <zeroquake> booleans play along well with json ?
[07:26:39] <Cork> zeroquake: json is a subset of javascript
[07:26:44] <Cork> so yes boolean exists in json
[07:27:13] <zeroquake> thank you , i will go boolean
[07:28:27] <CrashTes1Dummy73> Cork: Is it possible that the same conflict prevents a jQuery plugin from getting loaded?
[07:28:42] <Cork> CrashTes1Dummy73: not likely no
[07:29:04] <Cork> unless the plugin doesn't follow the specifications and wrap it self in (function($) {})(jQuery)
[07:29:19] <Cork> meaning it should do that ^
[07:30:17] <CrashTes1Dummy73> Cork: This looks differently. What do you think? https://github.com/iamceege/tooltipster/blob/master/js/jquery.tooltipster.js
[07:30:49] <Cork> CrashTes1Dummy73: that is a form optimized for minification
[07:30:54] <Cork> so yes it is wrapped like it should be
[07:31:13] <Cork> the important part is that is does the $ = jQuery part
[07:31:34] <CrashTes1Dummy73> Cork: So any guestimation why I get jQuery(...).tooltipster is not a function
[07:31:52] <Cork> CrashTes1Dummy73: check so you're not loading multiple jquery version

[07:37:20] <Cork> *$('meta[itemprop="contentUrl"]').attr('content')
[07:37:45] <joshft91> @cork hmm, easier than I thought. What's the difference between your two examples?
[07:37:53] <Cork> or ya $('.my_class').find('meta[itempop="contentUrl"]').attr('content')
[07:38:06] <Cork> joshft91: itempop => itemprop
[07:38:06] <joshft91> Cool, thanks much man
[07:38:08] <Cork> typo
[07:47:00] <Forbidd3n> Cork: does this look correct for the entire process?
[07:47:05] <Forbidd3n> Cork: http://pastebin.com/X3eTRwiF
[07:48:01] <Forbidd3n> it seems to work but the clearTimeout(handle); on line 17 doesn't clear. It keeps processing in console
[07:52:39] <FriedZombie> I don't see handle defined anywhere in your script to be honest
[07:54:04] <xxx1337> hey i'm using this jquery lightbox plugin called magnific popup. I want to create a popup after a form submit. I'm reading the documentation, however, and it only has options to initilze a popup when an element is clicked: http://dimsemenov.com/plugins/magnific-popup/documentation.html#content_types
[07:54:19] <xxx1337> anyone know how i can get it to pop up after a form submit and a page reload?
[07:54:24] <Forbidd3n> Cork: even here it still doesn't clear the timeout on line 17 - http://pastebin.com/Evn68z7e
[07:57:01] <Forbidd3n> Cork: still around?
[08:01:04] <BlackHorn> can anyone help me? i'm trying to get my one div to show and hide and disappear when clicking away from it. My code is here. http://pastebin.com/gAHfryKe
[08:01:18] <xxx1337> how do i write an element to get clicked on page load in jquery?
[08:01:44] <xxx1337> but not by the user click, rather it clicks because the page loaded
[08:01:53] <slax0r> xxx1337: $(document).ready(function() { $("element selector").click(); } ?
[08:02:14] <xxx1337> oh ok
[08:02:17] <slax0r> but it would be simpler to just call the even handler than do a programatical click
[08:02:20] <slax0r> and cleaner
[08:02:21] <slax0r> if you ask me
[08:02:32] <BillCriswell> That or trigger('click')... I forget if there's a reason for one over the other.
[08:03:30] <slax0r> BlackHorn: explain more, can you display an overlay around that div?
[08:04:01] <slax0r> so it would be <div class="overlay" (full height, and full width)><div class="div in question" (centered or something)></div></div>
[08:04:16] <BlackHorn> I haven't tried that.
[08:04:21] <slax0r> because then you can add a listener to the "overlay" and when a click lands on it, close the div that you want to close(hide, remove, whatever)
[08:04:40] <BlackHorn> one moment. lemme just try that.
[08:04:48] <BlackHorn> position absolute for the overlay?
[08:05:04] <slax0r> BlackHorn: yeah, so it covers the whole site
[08:05:10] <slax0r> only that div should be above it
[08:05:13] <xxx1337> err wait a minute i dont think that is what i'm looking for http://jsfiddle.net/3c9c2r1g/2/
[08:05:19] <slax0r> you might need some z-indexing
[08:05:33] <xxx1337> i want para 1 to get clicked so that the first paragraph shows on page load
[08:05:38] <xxx1337> but the user never actually clicks it
[08:07:05] <BlackHorn> sorry, lagging right now. Trying it though.
[08:07:46] <slax0r> xxx1337: try now: http://jsfiddle.net/3c9c2r1g/6/
[08:07:59] <slax0r> your selector was wrong
[08:08:05] <slax0r> and you didn't wrap in document ready..
[08:08:55] <BlackHorn> Yeah. i have an overlay now. Basically...what happened before was, the div didn't hide to start. It would hide when you clicked elsewhere, but then it wouldn't show again.
[08:12:12] <donni> hi all, is it okay to loop a jquery like this http://jsfiddle.net/qx31qjbo/ ?
[08:12:23] <donni> #laravel
[08:13:34] <BillCriswell> donni: If they all have a shared classname just $('.foo').mangnifcPopup() would do the same thing.
[08:14:35] <BlackHorn> sorry. lost connection.
[08:14:41] <BlackHorn> did you have a solution?
[08:15:13] <joshft91> I'm trying to get an attribute value, but it's returning undefined instead. Here's the jquery: var videoUrl = $('meta[itemprop="contentUrl"]').attr('content');
[08:15:32] <joshft91> And the node looks like this: <meta itemprop="contentURL" content="http://blahblahblah.com"/>
[08:15:40] <donni> BillCriswell i want it called separately . so i loop it
[08:15:41] <joshft91> Is there something easy I'm doing wrong?
[08:16:23] <donni> BillCriswell is that okay? its runnnig, i'm worrying about the performance
[08:17:05] <BillCriswell> donni: If .add-training1,2,3 etc all have a class plain old .add-training you can just do $('.add-training').plugin(); instead of each one. That'll basically handle the loop for you.
[08:17:47] <BillCriswell> joshft91: Looks right. What id you try .prop('content') instead?
[08:19:04] <donni> BillCriswell if i do it, it will only shows the first one, let say i want to popup information2, by doing that i will only get the information1 whenever i click
[08:19:24] <donni> BillCriswell i do looping aswell for the information
[08:19:31] <joshft91> BillCriswell: still says it's undefined. Hmm. I added a document.ready() function but that didn't make a difference either. This is strange...
[08:20:13] <BillCriswell> joshft91: Shot in the dark but what if you put a name attribute on it?
[08:20:41] <Legie> hello, iam really newbie with jQ: is anybody around who can help me figure out how technicly make function for change 1st<div> to 2nd<div> by using jQuery? it should be so simple
[08:20:46] <BillCriswell> donni: I'd need to see a demo of what you're doing.
[08:21:29] <donni> okay BillCriswell
[08:22:14] <BillCriswell> If you were to do like $('.foo').plugin() you should still be able to do like $('.foo-1').plugin('someOption', 3);
[08:22:29] <BillCriswell> Legie: Like, swap their places?
[08:22:58] <joshft91> BillCriswell: How would I do the same thing but without jQuery? I'm wondering if my jQuery script isn't getting in there...would give me something to rule out anyway
[08:23:06] <joshft91> (working with chrome extensions in case that matters)
[08:23:35] <BillCriswell> document.querySelector( someSelector );
[08:24:44] <joshft91> So for something like: <meta itemprop="contentURL" content="http://something.com"/> == document.querySelector(meta itemproper...??)
[08:25:32] <BillCriswell> Yeah, document.querySelector('meta[itemprop=contentUrl]')
[08:25:58] <joshft91> Gotcha; I'll give it a shot
[08:27:33] <Legie> BillCriswell: yup, swap places i have 2 divs beneath it and i want to change it by clicking on some element (for example 2<li>`s ) and change their places
[08:30:22] <Forbidd3n> BillCriswell: Is there not a way to have a progress bar update based on an ajax call to php script that is running?
[08:30:53] <BillCriswell> Forbidd3n: Never tried it. Seems like a good question for google.
[08:31:24] <Forbidd3n> When a user clicks the import listings button I need to show them how many listings have been imported as they are imported via ajax call.
[08:31:26] <BlackHorn> can anyone help me with my code? its here http://pastebin.com/9cWMaXZe I'm trying to get it to show and hide the div. For some reason, the div isn't showing when i click my li.
[08:31:48] <Forbidd3n> the issue is I can't seem to get the ob_flush and flush to send response back
[08:32:13] <BillCriswell> Forbidd3n: I just fake progress bars. Too much trouble than their worth.
[08:32:23] <BillCriswell> they're*
[08:32:47] <Forbidd3n> how do you fake it. If you show 100% and it is still running then it will be confusing to the user
[08:34:01] <BlackHorn> can anyone help with my problem?
[08:34:39] <BillCriswell> Forbidd3n: I add random increments till it's completed then zoom to 100%.
[08:35:05] <BillCriswell> BlackHorn: If #friendslist is inside overlay you're always clicking on overlay.
[08:35:12] <Forbidd3n> so it goes from 20% 30% 22% 18% and then 100%
[08:35:26] <BlackHorn> ok, one sec.
[08:35:29] <BillCriswell> Forbidd3n: I would never have it go backwards.
[08:35:29] <BlackHorn> gonna try that.
[08:35:36] <decx> also you attach handlers outside of your doc ready
[08:35:47] <decx> that's just asking for trouble
[08:35:56] <BlackHorn> divs still aren't showing.
[08:36:11] <BlackHorn> i'm new to jquery.
[08:36:12] <Forbidd3n> well what if it takes longer than your incremented values?
[08:36:16] <BlackHorn> so, what should i do?
[08:36:23] <BlackHorn> sorry if i seem like an idiot right now
[08:36:23] <BlackHorn> lol
[08:36:24] <BillCriswell> Forbidd3n: It hangs out at 99% for a while.
[08:37:09] <Forbidd3n> do you have an example of your js code?
[08:37:44] <BlackHorn> anyone?
[08:38:07] <donni> BillCriswell it won't pop up here, but this is what i'm doing http://jsfiddle.net/k2c0sw6q/
[08:38:08] <BillCriswell> BlackHorn: Is friendslist inside overlay?
[08:38:44] <decx> basicly your approach isnt good
[08:38:57] <BillCriswell> Forbidd3n: http://ricostacruz.com/nprogress/
[08:39:05] <decx> you want your overlay separate and below your modal
[08:39:52] <BillCriswell> Forbidd3n: Basically, calling the .inc() method will never get you to 100%
[08:40:22] <axilla> hi all, i am working on an interface and trying to hide the drab browser specified upload browse buttons and such.
[08:40:36] <Forbidd3n> then call done - hmm
[08:40:53] <BillCriswell> Forbidd3n: Most progress bars are full of shit.
[08:41:05] <BillCriswell> At least... in the statistics I just made up.
[08:41:39] <axilla> i have the following code which "works" it clicks and brings up the file selection dialog just like i'd expect it to, but it doesn't load the file into the upload field.. if i click save it doesnt save the file i've chosen, but if i click the button manually it does? thoughts
[08:41:43] <axilla> https://gist.github.com/travisdmathis/1d8ec0a67fbf0c8bfe17
[08:41:43] <axilla> what am i missing here.
[08:42:32] <kpap> basically, i want to trigger a "Show more posts"-link click when i've scrolled to it
[08:42:42] <Forbidd3n> BillCriswell:  with that example - can I have my own progress bar or does it have to go across the top of the screen?
[08:43:10] <axilla> Forbidd3n: you can do anything you want in the world of development :)
[08:44:09] <BillCriswell> Forbidd3n: https://github.com/rstacruz/nprogress
[08:47:38] <robertmaxrees> Goooood morning #jquery
[08:47:54] <BillCriswell> Ayyyyy.
[08:49:09] <BillCriswell> Legie: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/698301/is-there-a-native-jquery-function-to-switch-elements
[08:49:11] <thebope> 'ello
[08:49:44] <BillCriswell> thebope: Ayyy
[08:50:01] <thebope> long time
[08:50:06] <thebope> hows things?
[08:50:46] <eddie24601> yo
[08:51:03] <BillCriswell> Good good. You?
[08:52:31] <axilla> ahhhh i think i know the answer :
[08:52:41] <axilla> its a security issue and there is a work around :D
[08:53:14] <thebope> Very good!
[08:53:25] <thebope> Everythings been pretty positive lately
[08:56:15] <Forbidd3n> BillCriswell: Is this the correct usage? - http://pastebin.com/1QmnY6Tt
[08:56:28] <Forbidd3n> it doesn't show the bar and I have the files loaded
[08:57:23] <BillCriswell> Forbidd3n: I have no idea.
[08:57:34] <Forbidd3n> I thought you recommended it because you use it
[08:58:00] <BillCriswell> Forbidd3n: I have, but I know nothing about your HTML,if you're including the files properly, etc, etc.
[08:58:47] <Forbidd3n> I am including the nprogress.css and nprogress.js files required as stated in the install instructions and what you have there is my on click function
[08:58:57] <Forbidd3n> that initializes it and done when completed
[08:59:46] <BillCriswell> What you have looks fine, the rest of it I have clue about.
[09:00:11] <BlackHorn> Can anyone help me yet? I've asked a few times and you've just half helped.
[09:00:18] <BillCriswell> You said that it doesn't show the bar at all, so there's something now right.
[09:00:42] <BillCriswell> BlackHorn: You didn't answer the question I asked twice.
[09:01:00] <BillCriswell> so there's something not right*
[09:07:30] <BillCriswell> Jesus Christ.

[09:42:06] <Xtremefire> hi all
[09:45:09] <robertmaxrees> good morning
[09:50:03] <ezio> i'm generating <a> buttons with javascript but on the iphone i can't click on them
[09:50:05] <Xtremefire> I have a JSON data like this  http://pastebin.com/RqZEVKNU.     Its a mutidimensional array. It store playerdetail in array of array with a index like 1,2.. ask you can see. How can I get playerdetails into Jquery.
[09:50:09] <ezio> can someone look at this?
[09:50:10] <ezio> http://dev.textbookexchange.ca/book/george-r-r-martins-a-game-of-thrones-4book-boxed-set-a-game-of-thrones-a-clash-of-kings-a-storm-of-swords-and-a-feast-for-crows-mass-marke
[09:50:20] <ezio> in safari for windows i can click on them
[09:51:30] <Xtremefire> There are 3-4 extra property of player that is stored to player but I dont wanna display those. Just wanna display selected properties like kill,death :)
[09:52:32] <Xtremefire> Help plz
[09:58:37] <Xtremefire>  I have a JSON data like this  http://pastebin.com/RqZEVKNU.     Its a mutidimensional array. It store playerdetail in array of array with a index like 1,2.. ask you can see.

[09:59:01] <BillCriswell> Xtremefire: That's not an array
[09:59:12] <Xtremefire> Its a JSON
[09:59:26] <Xtremefire> I wanna recieve in JS
[09:59:34] <Xtremefire> And put that in some divs
[10:00:38] <BillCriswell> Xtremefire: http://jsbin.com/gowikamoqidu/1/edit?js,output
[10:04:46] <Xtremefire> ok
[10:15:54] <|DZ|> guys is it faster to get a bunch of input elements like this $("input:checkbox") or have an array of IDs i can loop thru to manipulate each one?
[10:17:28] <BillCriswell> |DZ|: What are you getting them for?
[10:18:06] <|DZ|> bill - i need to clear their values
[10:18:14] <|DZ|> im also getting radios, textbox, etc
[10:18:25] <|DZ|> bill- clearing them in diffferent ways (using JQM)
[10:19:10] <BillCriswell> A list of ids would be way more work than it's worth. $('input[type=checkbox]') would be the best bet I'd imagine.
[10:19:35] <BillCriswell> input:checkbox called input[type=checkbox]... really not sure why :checkbox exists now that I think about it.
[10:20:23] <|DZ|> bill -ok cool, thanks for the advice
[10:21:00] <voronika> the writeup on :checkbox is interesting.
[10:21:01] <BillCriswell> |DZ|: No problem.
[10:21:12] <BillCriswell> voronika: Yeah I was just looking at that lol
[10:21:15] <ssssMd> hi i need some help with a script. can anyone help me?
[10:22:02] <BillCriswell> voronika: Wonder what the reason was for that besides it being a few characters less to type.
[10:22:06] <ssssMd> please? :)
[10:22:37] <BillCriswell> ssssMd: Just ask your question. No reason to ask to ask.
[10:23:01] <ssssMd> i need to explain...
[10:23:11] <xxx1337> Is it possible to have my form not refresh the page and still have it check for validations and send email (using php)
[10:23:43] <BillCriswell> xxx1337: Yes, your email script would need to send back the errors though.
[10:23:44] <|DZ|> xxx - you could call out to your php using ajax
[10:24:38] <xxx1337> okay so i prevent the form from actually submitting using js
[10:24:52] <xxx1337> then in my js validation at the end i do ajax to call a php function?
[10:25:01] <xxx1337> the php function that also validates and sends mail?
[10:25:55] <BillCriswell> xxx1337: Your PHP should always do validation as well.
[10:25:57] <robertmaxrees> xxx1337 sure can.  pretty common in fact.
[10:26:10] <robertmaxrees> also: you're calling a URL with your JS, not PHP directly.
[10:26:16] <robertmaxrees> just to be clear ;_
[10:26:22] <robertmaxrees> err, :)
[10:26:27] <BillCriswell> Javascript is typically used to save a trip to the server, but you always have to validate on the server.
[10:28:10] <xxx1337> how do i do the ajax part
[10:28:17] <xxx1337> i have a php function called sendMail
[10:28:41] <robertmaxrees> sendMail needs to be run when you POST to a URL.
[10:29:17] <xxx1337> robertmaxrees: how do i post though
[10:29:22] <xxx1337> the form doesn't refresh the page
[10:29:29] <xxx1337> after submit
[10:29:54] <robertmaxrees> you can do that using $.ajax() :0
[10:30:15] <robertmaxrees> or $,post()
[10:30:41] <BillCriswell> if (noFormErrors) { $.post('scriptThatSendsMail.php', $('#some-form').serializeArray(), function () { /* Yay all done */ }); }
[10:32:39] <robertmaxrees> basically, rtfm :) the api docs are pretty good for this sort of stuff.
[10:32:54] <frozenyogurt> hey all
[10:33:03] <frozenyogurt> im having a weird issue but only in safari 6.1 and 7
[10:33:11] <frozenyogurt> 6.0 is good and all other browsers as well
[10:33:17] <frozenyogurt> http://hipstersandhamptonites.github.io/gramercy_main/
[10:33:40] <frozenyogurt> this is the site where the issue is, the triangle being pulled all the way to the left in safari 6.1 and 7 is the problem
[10:34:19] <xxx1337> BillCriswell: I don't have a file for the script that sends the mail
[10:34:28] <xxx1337> does this mean i have to create one?
[10:34:50] <xxx1337> nvm i think that was a dumb question
[10:34:57] <BillCriswell> xxx1337: Yes. Have to create it.
[10:35:15] <BillCriswell> <?php mail($to, $subject, $body, $headers); ?> or some shit.
[10:38:13] <BillCriswell> of course you'd validate in there as well.
[10:38:25] <Vino> The jqueryui downloader seems to be broken: jqueryui.com/download/
[10:38:46] <robertmaxrees> Vino might want to report that in #jquery-dev then :)
[10:38:53] <Vino> gotcha
[10:39:11] <robertmaxrees> and it just worked for me.
[10:41:32] <Lebbe> $('*').off('click').click(function() {return false;});
[10:42:23] <robertmaxrees> wat
[10:42:29] <robertmaxrees> are you trying to prevent a link click?
[10:42:54] <Lebbe> im trying to prevent all clicks every. I don't like them.
[10:43:01] <Lebbe> s/every/ever/
[10:43:04] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[10:43:19] <robertmaxrees> then do $(document).on('click', 'a', function(e) {});
[10:43:40] <Lebbe> but that will only work on links
[10:43:43] <BillCriswell> lol
[10:43:49] <robertmaxrees> and then inside of that e.stopImmediatePropagation();
[10:44:00] <Lebbe> I want to disable every fucking click in the whole browser
[10:44:06] <robertmaxrees> then change that to * instead of 'a', but that's really strange.  why?
[10:44:21] <Lebbe> because end-users clicking everywhere really messes up my software
[10:44:28] <robertmaxrees> wut
[10:46:01] <Lebbe> $('*').off('click').click(function(e) {e.stopImmediatePropagation(); return false;});
[10:46:05] <Lebbe> is that better?
[10:46:10] <BillCriswell> lol ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[10:46:12] <robertmaxrees> don;t use return false;
[10:46:18] <Lebbe> why not
[10:46:20] <robertmaxrees> totally unnecessary.
[10:46:33] <robertmaxrees> stopImmediatePropagation(); does everything you need.
[10:46:40] <ryanneufeld> but return false isn't a bad habbut
[10:46:44] <ryanneufeld> *habbit
[10:46:48] <robertmaxrees> i'd argue it is personally.
[10:47:05] <ryanneufeld> that's within your right
[10:47:42] <Lebbe> is there some easy way to make sure that $('*').off('click').click(function(e) {e.stopImmediatePropagation(); return false;}); runs for all eventually new DOM-elements as well
[10:48:07] <Lebbe> in case some mother fucking front-end developer ajax some clickable elements into the DOM
[10:48:07] <robertmaxrees> by using the delegated syntax I put up.
[10:48:24] <ryanneufeld> Lebbe: what is your use case for this?
[10:48:47] <Lebbe> ryanneufeld: it is really more of a technique of preventing "use cases"
[10:49:11] <ryanneufeld> You're not making any sense
[10:49:56] <ryanneufeld> by disabling clicks your being user-hostile, which is bad, and you're also fighting against the very nature of how a browser works
[10:50:18] <Lebbe> I am user-hostile
[10:50:40] <Lebbe> well gotta go, we talk more about this later
[10:50:45] <ryanneufeld> not likely
[10:50:49] <ryanneufeld> but have a good day
[10:50:58] <robertmaxrees> welp
[10:52:10] <ryanneufeld> "because end-users clicking everywhere really messes up my software" like... what does that even mean?
[10:52:13] <xxx1337> BillCriswell: For some reason when I call the php file it doesn't run
[10:52:26] <robertmaxrees> sounds like he's working against some other developers.
[10:52:30] <Vino> if you don't like end users then why are you writing software
[10:52:31] <xxx1337> $.post('_libraries/php/sendEmail.php', $('#form_877936').serializeArray(), function () { alert('test'); });
[10:52:33] <robertmaxrees> probably frustrated.
[10:52:35] <xxx1337> the test alert works
[10:52:41] <xxx1337> but sendEmail.php isn't run
[10:52:55] <ryanneufeld> xxx1337: then your php is returning an HTTP 200
[10:52:57] <BillCriswell> You guys didn't smell troll immediately?
[10:53:09] <ryanneufeld> BillCriswell: I did, which is why I called him out on it :p
[10:53:28] <xxx1337> HTTP 200?
[10:53:34] <ryanneufeld> ?http
[10:53:50] <ryanneufeld> xxx1337: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes#2xx_Success
[10:54:00] <ryanneufeld> so, basically, your php script didn't error out
[10:54:10] <xxx1337> right
[10:54:17] <BillCriswell> Everything went 200.
[10:54:26] <ryanneufeld> $.post('_libraries/php/sendEmail.php', $('#form_877936').serializeArray(), function () { console.log(arguments); });
[10:54:29] <ryanneufeld> try that
[10:54:33] <ryanneufeld> also don't use alerts for testing ajax
[10:54:39] <BillCriswell> 100 on with what you're doing.
[10:54:41] <ryanneufeld> since they're blocking
[10:55:01] <ryanneufeld> then look at the console to see what your script is returning xxx1337
[10:57:10] <xxx1337> hm ok the console is success code from sendEmail.php
[10:57:16] <xxx1337> but the email isn't getting sent out
[10:57:54] <BillCriswell> xxx1337: if(mail()){ echo 'IT SENT!'; }
[10:57:59] <BillCriswell> xxx1337: Also, check your spam.
[10:58:22] <ryanneufeld> and the mail queue on your server
[10:59:13] <xxx1337> do i put the if statement after the mail->send ?
[11:01:24] <xxx1337> i had the email sending before so it isn't in my spam folder
[11:01:49] <xxx1337> and i don't see 'IT SENT' anywhere in my console after adding that line after the mail->send
[11:04:02] <xxx1337> i think this is becoming a question for #php suddenly
[11:05:46] <ryanneufeld> xxx1337: can you paste your email script? I speak php, might be able to help
[11:07:02] <xxx1337> i got it working
[11:07:18] <xxx1337> it wasn't accessing my email class
[11:07:34] <xxx1337> because it was in a seperate file that i apparently wasnt including properly
[11:07:50] <xxx1337> but i wasn't sure how to include properly so i just threw it in that same php file
[11:07:53] <xxx1337> and it works now
[11:08:11] <Uhkis> protip: use require if you actually need it
[11:08:18] <ryanneufeld> require_once(/path to file)
[11:08:34] <ryanneufeld> Uhkis++
[11:08:35] <xxx1337> that's what i had
[11:08:40] <xxx1337> didnt seem to work
[11:09:12] <xxx1337> oh i think i had to require once in that php file derp
[11:09:13] <xxx1337> oh well
[11:09:14] <xxx1337> too late
[11:46:20] <BillCriswell> I fucking love moment
[11:47:12] <BillCriswell> Ugh, hate naming shit though.
[11:56:32] <jftf> There should be an app where you search a keyword and this keyword looks for songs tagged this and begins playing said song when the keyword is mentioned
[11:56:55] <jftf> so you can quickly search and play said song in conversation
[11:57:18] <jftf> Youtube basically has a link to timestamp ability
[11:57:28] <jftf> if you could catalog these according to tags...
[11:57:38] <dmsuperman> youtube supports tags
[11:57:40] <dmsuperman> I believe
[11:58:18] <jftf> but the idea is that this website/webapp would link not only the song but the timestamp where the keyword is mentioned in the song
[11:58:31] <jftf> so when you click the song the song begins right where the word searched is mentioned
[11:59:14] <ryanneufeld> jftf: you mean like spotify
[11:59:19] <ryanneufeld> or lastfm
[11:59:36] <ryanneufeld> oh, you mean something else
[11:59:36] <voronika> does lastfm forward based on lyrics?
[12:00:20] <jftf> ok lemme try again. not just linking a song by a tag
[12:00:36] <jftf> i mean linking a song's specific timestamp where a keyword was mentioned (as a lyric) within the song itself
[12:01:05] <dmsuperman> you want a database of links from a given word to the timestamp in various videos on youtube where that exact word was mentioned
[12:01:12] <dmsuperman> this would require A: a lyrics database, with B: timestamped lyrics
[12:01:18] <dmsuperman> like karoake format
[12:01:24] <voronika> spotify:track:4MB8cfTICv4aCpZplYUENd#0:50   i guess spotify's uri does include timestamp
[12:01:24] <b-ot> voronika: ♩ Sun Dance by Tomahawk ▮▮▮▮▮▮▮▮▮▮
[12:01:41] <jftf> or it's user generated so people put the links in themselves...
[12:01:50] <dmsuperman> well you can do that right now
[12:01:53] <voronika> to database that would be a nightmare.
[12:01:57] <dmsuperman> you go to youtube, find the relevant song, find the timestamp
[12:02:04] <dmsuperman> and generate the link at current time via right click
[12:02:11] <jftf> ambitous i know
[12:02:20] <jftf> o i gtg. brb
[12:02:30] <dmsuperman> really impractical, it's hard enough getting a good lyrics database let alone one with timestamps
[12:02:41] <dmsuperman> that would be step #1
[12:02:53] <voronika> i wonder if there's a db with lyrics and chords, with speed...
[12:19:04] <jumanji> hi guys how can I select both the current document and the iframe and it's contents?
[12:19:15] <jumanji> $(document, iframe).on('mouseover'){} etc
[12:22:11] <dmsuperman> jumanji: "the iframe" meaning what
[12:22:28] <dmsuperman> jumanji: and "its contents" meaning what, the HTML from inside the iframe?
[12:22:32] <jumanji> dmsuperman i want a selector for iframes on the page and its contents
[12:22:39] <dmsuperman> $('iframe')
[12:22:43] <dmsuperman> that will select iframes on the page
[12:22:55] <jumanji> dmsuperman is there a selector that will get me the contents without doing .contents()?
[12:23:14] <jumanji> basically I am looking to select all the elements on the current document, and also all the elemets inside any iframes
[12:23:23] <dmsuperman> why don't you want to use .contents()
[12:23:31] <jumanji> $(document, iframe:contents) looking for something like that
[12:23:49] <jumanji> I need to attach a handler
[12:23:55] <dmsuperman> a handler to what
[12:23:57] <jumanji> $(document).on('mouseover',function (e) {});
[12:24:07] <jumanji> I want to attach it to iframe contents as well
[12:24:18] <dmsuperman> you want to attach a mouseover handler to an iframe?
[12:24:28] <dmsuperman> I don't think you can add event handlers to the document inside the iframe
[12:24:30] <jumanji> all the elements in side the iframe
[12:26:00] <jumanji> dmsuperman are you sure ?
[12:26:29] <dmsuperman> Not entirely. stackoverflow suggests you can use iframe.contentWindow.document to access the document
[12:26:43] <dmsuperman> but I'm pretty sure that only works if it's the same domain
[12:26:47] <dmsuperman> and I'm not sure it works in all browsers
[12:27:29] <dmsuperman> seems to work in chrome though, for the same domain at least
[12:28:53] <jumanji> im developing a chrome extension need some way to bypass the single origin
[12:28:55] <dmsuperman> different domains I get a security error when trying to access the document
[12:29:17] <dmsuperman> you're not likely to get around that easily
[12:29:20] <dmsuperman> it's a security concern
[12:34:47] <ryanneufeld> voronika: there are dbs like that, the problem is they're usually licensed as Karaoke
[12:35:07] <ryanneufeld> when I was working for metrolyrics.com we were looking into something like that
[12:35:41] <ryanneufeld> our ios app even had some croud sourced abiilty to get pseudo accurate timestamps from users.
[12:52:03] <xxx1337> Can someone help me write my phone number regular expression? I have  var phoneno = /^\(?([0-9]{3})\)?[-. ]?([0-9]{3})[-. ]?([0-9]{4})$/;
[12:52:12] <xxx1337> it mostly works except it fails if there are space characters
[12:52:38] <robertmaxrees> all depends on which phone numbers you care about.
[12:52:39] <xxx1337> for instance "(123) 456 - 1234" fails
[12:53:07] <arbiter34> >> /^\(?([0-9]{3})\)?[-. ]+?([0-9]{3})[-. ]+?([0-9]{4})$/
[12:53:29] <arbiter34> using your's as a base
[12:53:53] <xxx1337> I'll try it thanks
[12:54:14] <robertmaxrees> xxx1337 why not just strip all non digit characters first?
[12:54:24] <robertmaxrees> and then just test the length of the number?
[13:08:21] <alaing_> hey ppl
[13:11:26] <ryanneufeld> xxx1337: regexp101
[13:13:30] <robertmaxrees> lesson 1: if you think the solution is a regex, you're probably wrong :D
[13:15:18] <ryanneufeld> xxx1337: http://regex101.com/r/gC9vZ7/1
[13:15:28] <ryanneufeld> also, checkout #regexp
[13:15:31] <ryanneufeld> also, checkout #regex
[13:15:33] <ryanneufeld> rather
[13:19:44] <ryanneufeld> xxx1337: http://regex101.com/r/gC9vZ7/2 a little closer
[13:21:41] <dmsuperman> xxx1337: what are you wanting to do with this regexp?
[13:21:57] <jftf> Back to what I was saying...not that difficult. you don't need a database with lyrics n stuff
[13:22:01] <dmsuperman> xxx1337: My preferred approach is to remove all non-number characters then just make sure it's 10 chars
[13:22:34] <xxx1337> ... sorry for not responding but i thought i had my reg exp from arbiter
[13:22:35] <jftf> You only need to have someone add a youtube link with the timestamp within the link.
[13:22:35] <xxx1337> thanks anyway
[13:22:41] <xilyin> usually, i just strip out anything that isn't a digit, then validate that
[13:22:53] <dmsuperman> jftf: "only"
[13:22:58] <dmsuperman> let us know how that goes :P
[13:23:09] <jftf> :C
[13:23:14] <jftf> hehe
[13:23:15] <dmsuperman> the technical side of things is trivial, getting people to fill the database is hard
[13:23:28] <kpap> Hi.
[13:25:43] <gazza-911> can anyone tell me the url of the files I'd need for a userscript (that uses jQuery UI dialog)
[13:26:19] <dmsuperman> gazza-911: eh?
[13:28:15] <gazza-911> Basically, I just want to know the <script src url rather than downloading a copy of jQuery UI
[13:28:42] <BillCriswell> gazza-911: You could use Google CDN for it... but this is really easy googling.
[13:28:43] <robertmaxrees> you want a hosted copy?
[13:28:54] <robertmaxrees> the google developers site and CDN links.
[13:29:02] <robertmaxrees> !g google cdn jquery ui
[13:29:03] <b-ot> robertmaxrees: Google Hosted Libraries - Google Developers → https://developers.google.com/speed/libraries/devguide
[13:30:03] <gazza-911> thanks, I copied that, but I must have mispelt it as it said 404 not found
[13:30:34] <robertmaxrees> then search "google cdn jquery ui" in google yourself.
[13:30:41] <dmsuperman> lol
[13:30:58] <robertmaxrees> -70-113-19-225.austin.res.rr.com) has left #jquery
[13:30:58] <robertmaxrees> [2014:08:13:13:27:37] * cmoneylulz (~cmoneylul@192
[13:31:00] <robertmaxrees> woops
[13:31:07] <BillCriswell> Worst IRCer ever.
[13:31:08] <robertmaxrees> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[13:31:11] <BillCriswell> Hahaha
[13:31:17] <robertmaxrees> seriously i am terrible at irc :(
[13:32:26] <Mithaldu> does jquery offer a way to change the order of the event handles on an object?
[13:32:40] <Mithaldu> tried googling, but that only points to interfaces that were removed without replacement
[13:32:58] <robertmaxrees> re-ordering handlers smells to me - what's going on?
[13:33:16] <Mithaldu> something else registered an event to do slideup() on click
[13:33:31] <Mithaldu> it does so depending on the state of :hidden
[13:34:03] <Mithaldu> i need to trigger something else on slideup/slidedown, and i need to mirror the check on :hidden
[13:34:18] <robertmaxrees> why not just remove the handler and do your own thing?
[13:34:31] <Mithaldu> i need the other handler to stay intact
[13:34:47] <Mithaldu> since otherwise i'll just have to duplicate it
[13:35:02] <robertmaxrees> reordering handlers is funky business imo.  i'd rewrite the current handler to include your extra logic, or register different handlers for differet things
[13:35:12] <Mithaldu> all i need is to do my check before slideup/slidedown changes the :hidden state
[13:35:23] <Mithaldu> i cannot change the code of the other handler
[13:35:36] <Mithaldu> i need to work with the dom state as it is given to me
[13:35:56] <Mithaldu> optimally i'd just register hooks on slideup/slidedown, but it seems nobody implemented that
[13:36:17] <robertmaxrees> you could extend slideup/slidedown and hack it that way.
[13:36:24] <Mithaldu> extend how?
[13:36:32] <robertmaxrees> !g jquery extend
[13:36:33] <b-ot> robertmaxrees: jQuery.extend() | jQuery API Documentation → http://api.jquery.com/jquery.extend/
[13:37:03] <Mithaldu> i don't understand how merging objects helps me monkeypatch a function on an existing object
[13:37:16] <Mithaldu> or rather
[13:37:26] <Mithaldu> monkeypatch a function to be called on a specific dom object
[13:37:58] <Mithaldu> would i just replace the global jquery function with one that checks if it's being called on that dom object?
[13:38:16] <robertmaxrees> basically, there is no simple way to do what you want.  re-ordering handlers is funky.  so you'll either need to rewrite part of the functionality of jquery itself, or remvoe the handler and duplicate the functionaly with your new stuff.
[13:38:32] <robertmaxrees> brb
[13:38:35] <Mithaldu> it's not particularly funky in that case
[13:38:48] <Mithaldu> i'd only need to get the existing handler, store it, register mine, then register the old one
[13:38:50] <Mithaldu> job done
[13:41:16] <robertmaxrees> sorry about that.
[13:41:23] <Mithaldu> np
[13:41:37] <Mithaldu> will this still work with 1.8.3? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5007279/extending-an-existing-jquery-function
[13:41:47] <robertmaxrees> so to ask the question - why are you not able to modify the existing code?
[13:42:07] <Mithaldu> policies, it's third-party code
[13:42:45] <robertmaxrees> okay - that's relevant.  is it a plugin or something?
[13:42:54] <robertmaxrees> just wondering if there's a less hacky way to accomplish what you wanmt.
[13:42:56] <robertmaxrees> *want
[13:43:07] <Mithaldu> it's not public software
[13:43:12] <dmsuperman> my usual approach to that is to create my own new event
[13:43:25] <dmsuperman> that my code triggers, and when that event handler is run, it _then_ triggers the relevant third party event
[13:43:28] <dmsuperman> to control the order
[13:43:29] <Mithaldu> frankly i'm amazed that reordering event handlers is considered hacky
[13:43:43] <dmsuperman> why? events happen asynchronously
[13:43:45] <robertmaxrees> ^^ dmsuperman's solution sounds about right.
[13:44:30] <Mithaldu> dmsuperman: the third party event is generated anonymously and put on click
[13:44:50] <robertmaxrees> you can still triggerHandler() or just trigger() the original binding.
[13:44:54] <Mithaldu> i have no idea how a custom event would help there
[13:45:07] <Mithaldu> since i cannot retrieve the events on click and put themelsewhere
[13:47:47] <dmsuperman> Mithaldu: you want your code to happen before the third party click event happens right?
[13:48:15] <Mithaldu> yes, instead of pushing onto the handler list i want to shift onto it
[13:49:08] <Mithaldu> this seems to be a usable enough hack:
[13:49:09] <Mithaldu> $.fn.slideUp = function() { alert("slideUp"); var ret = oldslideUp.apply(this, arguments); return ret; };
[13:49:26] <dmsuperman> makes pretty strong assumptions and is likely to break though
[13:49:42] <dmsuperman> but I suppose if it does what you want :P
[13:49:48] <Mithaldu> what assumptions?
[13:50:17] <Mithaldu> i don't mind being told what i'm doing is wrong, i just wish to be let know how it is wrong
[13:50:59] <dmsuperman> well what happens if a third library comes in and binds its click handler as well
[13:51:07] <dmsuperman> how do you know which one you're calling now
[13:51:24] <Mithaldu> i'm not changing click there
[13:51:35] <Mithaldu> i'm simply adding a hook to $.slideUp()
[13:52:06] <ciqsteve> Q- I have a group of classes with a common start string -- 'class-string- ....'
[13:52:07] <dmsuperman> well I asked if you wanted to replace the click handler, you said yes. but either way, whichever oldslideUp is
[13:52:14] <Mithaldu> i gotta admit i'm fairly frustrated that none of the animation functions have any events
[13:52:22] <ciqsteve> where the end of the class string varies  class-string-1 class-string-2
[13:52:23] <Mithaldu> var oldslideUp = $.fn.slideUp;
[13:52:28] <ciqsteve> There are 10 of them
[13:52:41] <ciqsteve> I need to remove whichever ones are attached to a particular element
[13:52:59] <ciqsteve> I don't know which ones are attached
[13:53:13] <ciqsteve> How can I remove any class starting with that string?  Is that possible?
[13:53:31] <robertmaxrees> sure - get the list of classes and run a regex against it.
[13:53:59] <Mithaldu> dmsuperman: sorry if i answered confusingly, but i explained earlier, i want to do things on slide, none of the animation stuff has hooks/events, so i figured to hack via click, since i could make the right decision if i could have my click event run before the third-party one changes the state of the dom element
[13:54:24] <ciqsteve> Rm = don't follow
[13:54:39] <dmsuperman> so you want to complete an action before the slideup event triggers Mithaldu?
[13:54:48] <infinitone> saf
[13:54:49] <Mithaldu> there is no slideup event
[13:54:54] <Mithaldu> that is the entire problem here
[13:54:57] <robertmaxrees> Mithaldu the animation stuff DOES have "hooks",  but you're not able to modify the third party code, which also doesn't sound like it provides any sort of public interface for these kinds of things.
[13:54:58] <Mithaldu> it's just a method
[13:54:58] <alaing_> robertmaxrees: i wouldnt use a regex
[13:55:06] <Mithaldu> robertmaxrees: it has callbacks
[13:55:10] <Mithaldu> those are not hooks
[13:55:21] <Mithaldu> hooks are things you can access from the outside
[13:55:26] <robertmaxrees> i don';t know how you're defining "hooks" then
[13:55:48] <alaing_> ciqsteve: you can use the filter option
[13:55:51] <robertmaxrees> alaing_ tons of ways to do it.
[13:55:51] <ciqsteve> would this work:  $(element).removeClass('[class*=" class-string-"]')
[13:56:31] <alaing_> ciqsteve: do you have a demo?
[13:56:36] <dmsuperman> no ciqsteve removeClass expects a class name
[13:56:37] <dmsuperman> not a selector
[13:56:49] <alaing_> ciqsteve: as dmsuperman says
[13:56:50] <Skapadapaduu> what's the difference if I import jquery (or other library) from internet or download it and import it from harddrive? which one is better?
[13:57:21] <alaing_> Skapadapaduu: one if online and the other is offline
[13:57:54] <ciqsteve> right, so how can I remove a class from a given element without writing 10 removeClass calls?  $(el).removeClass(class1) $(el).removeClass(class2)
[13:57:58] <ciqsteve> ... 10
[13:57:59] <Mithaldu> oh man, the story of jquery: try to prevent people from hanging themselves by limiting the rope they're given, forcing them to point a gun at their foot in hopes it doesn't go off
[13:58:02] <ciqsteve> only 1 will be there
[13:58:15] <alaing_> Skapadapaduu: obviously if you developing offline then then you need to download jqueyr so you have a local copy
[13:58:30] <robertbusy> Skapadapaduu if you use a copy from, say, Google, the user might already have that downloaded.
[13:59:25] <robertbusy> you could download it if you have a custom build process and want to include jquery in a file with some other stuff.  lots of approaches and stuff.
[13:59:35] <alaing_> ciqsteve: that looks like the element has 10 classes
[13:59:54] <ciqsteve> canelement has 1 class , but which 1 (of 10) I dont know
[14:00:31] <Vivekananda_y510> hi everyone
[14:00:42] <alaing_> ciqsteve: dont follow coudl you knock up something quickly on jsfiddle.net with the codey ou using?
[14:00:51] <alaing_> ciqsteve: i'll then take a look
[14:00:58] <alaing_> Hi Vivekananda_y510
[14:00:58] <Skapadapaduu> have there ever been a case that jquery servers are down and obv it doesnt work then for those who import it from online?
[14:01:48] <alaing_> Skapadapaduu: if you worried about it goign down there are was using js to dynamically load it so if the servers are down then it loads a local version
[14:01:59] <robertbusy> Skapadapaduu you wouldn't use "jquery's servers" - you'd use something like google's CDN or CDNJS or something.
[14:02:03] <alaing_> Skapadapaduu: local could also mean a copy of jquery on your server
[14:02:43] <ciqsteve> alaing_  :   http://jsfiddle.net/asxhs8m6/
[14:02:45] <dmsuperman> alaing_: he wants to remove classes that match a pattern
[14:02:51] <ciqsteve> except there are 10 colors
[14:02:57] <alaing_> taking a look
[14:03:04] <ciqsteve> I'm changing the color, so need to remove the existing class- but dont know what it is
[14:03:39] <dmsuperman> ciqsteve: the way to do it is as robert said
[14:03:46] <dmsuperman> iterate the classes, match them, remove if applicable
[14:04:36] <ciqsteve> just doing this for now (still open to more elegant solutions)
[14:04:41] <alaing_> ciqsteve: still not following so is there loads of divs with various classes?
[14:05:16] <ciqsteve> al - no 1 div.. need to change the color class-  so need to remove the red class and change it to green.. but I dont know that its red
[14:05:17] <alaing_> or are you trying to toggle from light to dark etc
[14:05:27] <ciqsteve> al - yes
[14:06:04] <ciqsteve>  $(el).removeClass().addClass('first-element').addClass(score_color_class_variable);
[14:06:26] <dmsuperman> ah yeah you can do .removeClass() and just remove all classes
[14:06:34] <dmsuperman> but obviously if you have non-color classes you'd lose those
[14:06:36] <dmsuperman> not the best
[14:06:44] <ciqsteve> y not a fan
[14:08:14] <alaing_> ciqsteve: couldnt you just use .toggleClass()?
[14:08:24] <dmsuperman> I just explained why ciqsteve
[14:08:27] <dmsuperman> alaing_: he doesn't know the class name
[14:08:59] <dmsuperman> He wants to remove any class matching "color-*" and then add a new one, for example color-red
[14:09:03] <alaing_> ah ok like a rag status thats computed at run time through a variable
[14:09:13] <ciqsteve> dmsuper - yes exactly
[14:10:18] <dmsuperman> ciqsteve: so did you do what robert suggested?
[14:10:23] <dmsuperman> that elegantly solves the issue
[14:10:30] <ciqsteve> the regex?
[14:10:35] <ciqsteve> didnt follow... :?
[14:10:37] <ciqsteve> :/
[14:10:39] <dmsuperman> I told you
[14:10:45] <dmsuperman> iterate the classes, match them, remove if it matches
[14:11:14] <dmsuperman> this shows you how to iterate the classes: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1227286/get-class-list-for-element-with-jquery
[14:11:23] <dmsuperman> the second code block for the first answer
[14:11:34] <dmsuperman> //do something would be a call to .removeClass
[14:12:52] <ciqsteve> dms - i see it.. then just one if statement for each color
[14:14:01] <ciqsteve> k.. ok.. thx for link dms.. appreciate it
[14:14:17] <dmsuperman> ciqsteve: no, not one per color. use a regex to match
[14:14:20] <dmsuperman> only one if statement needed
[14:14:36] <ciqsteve> ahh y, I get it
[14:14:40] <dmsuperman> :)
[14:19:00] <ciqsteve> dms--  for the example do I use  item.match(regex)  ?
[14:19:27] <robertbusy> you could also just do indexOf()
[14:19:58] <ciqsteve> like this (for match)
[14:19:59] <ciqsteve> item.match("/ciq-color-\w/")
[14:20:09] <ciqsteve> (doesn't like the \  )
[14:20:24] <dmsuperman> no quotes for regex
[14:20:40] <dmsuperman> item.match(/ciq-color-/) should be enough
[14:20:49] <dmsuperman> you might need to escape the hyphens
[14:21:01] <ciqsteve> \\-
[14:21:07] <ciqsteve> \-
[14:21:14] <dmsuperman> nevermind you don't
[14:21:18] <ciqsteve> k thx
[14:21:36] <dmsuperman> but it would be the latter (and you only need to escape them inside a [] character grouping)
[14:21:45] <ciqsteve> k ty
[14:23:28] <ciqsteve> here goes nothin..
[14:33:40] <Lolotoobo> Hi. A long time ago I used http://www.quirksmode.org/dom/usableforms.html. I'd like to know if there is a jquery plugin with the same function
[14:38:27] <robertbusy> which part of the functionality?  the showing/hiding things part?
[14:38:38] <robertbusy> 'cause you could write that part yourself pretty easily.
[14:55:34] <Vivekananda_y510> mooncup
[15:00:01] <midwestward> http://jsfiddle.net/ch2s2pgh/3/ - i am adding new form elements into a div that is located inside a <form> tag (just one form), but these form elements are not included in the request when the submit button is activated. is is possible to attach these new elements to the form or refresh the form somehow?
[15:09:03] <EminenceHC> What is the best way to check if a query string param is present in the url? On SO i see a million different answers.
[15:10:08] <shoky> midwestward: that's working fine
[15:11:39] <midwestward> shaky, thanks you're right. something else must be going on
[15:12:03] <robertbusy> EminenceHC there's no "best" way, just a few different ways.
[15:12:08] <robertbusy> are you looking for just the name?
[15:12:38] <shoky> midwestward: you have action=  twice in the <form>
[15:12:46] <shoky> midwestward: you want method="POST"
[15:12:49] <midwestward> ah
[15:12:51] <midwestward> yeah thankjs
[15:13:05] <EminenceHC> robertbusy: yeah. I realize location.search will give me the full params output. How can I find out if it contains the word "admin"?
[15:13:32] <robertbusy> window.location.search.indexOf('admin') > -1
[15:15:11] <uskerine> hi

[15:25:59] <TheWhisper> Does anyone know why this is not working? http://jsfiddle.net/xrtp6x03/2/
[15:26:08] <TheWhisper> hello
[15:26:19] <TheWhisper> Okay, sorry, my client was hanging
[15:26:22] <TheWhisper> Does anyone know why this is not working? http://jsfiddle.net/xrtp6x03/2/
[15:26:34] <TheWhisper> the top one should be blue, the middle should be green, and the bottom should be grey
[15:26:38] <TheWhisper> but instead they're all green
[15:28:23] <systemfault> Where do you see an element with an id of value4
[15:29:20] <fuse405> can someone have a quick look as to why this doesn't work http://scsys.co.uk:8002/415764
[15:29:32] <TheWhisper> Oh, systemfault, forgot to update that lol
[15:29:51] <TheWhisper> systemfault: http://jsfiddle.net/xrtp6x03/3/
[15:30:09] <TheWhisper> hm
[15:30:14] <TheWhisper> I think I'm using the wrong operators
[15:30:24] <TheWhisper> Looks like it should be && instead of ||
[15:32:11] <systemfault> TheWhisper, when you do .parent() then the .find, it selects all the .earth13 nodes..
[15:32:25] <TheWhisper> I know
[15:32:29] <TheWhisper> But it's doing .each()
[15:32:35] <TheWhisper> so it does them separately
[15:33:27] <robertbusy> the parent of .cardRight is "planetsCard", sooo...
[15:34:20] <TheWhisper> robertbusy & systemfault: http://jsfiddle.net/xrtp6x03/5/
[15:34:26] <TheWhisper> Got it working there
[15:35:40] <systemfault> Haha, I've been looking at a DOM issue the whole time... not a logic problem.
[15:35:47] <systemfault> Glad you got it fixed :)
[15:35:53] <TheWhisper> Thanks :)

[16:43:18] <sammych> now this is interesting https://github.com/mdo/css-perf
[17:29:31] <jrockjiggz> hi, if I use $('<a/>').appendTo('body').. this adds element to the DOM
[17:29:54] <jrockjiggz> but, how do I add html inside </a> before I appendTo('body') ?
[17:30:10] <systemfault> jrockjiggz: You can use variables.
[17:30:18] <jrockjiggz> $('<a/>').html( $('<div/>').html() ).appendTo('body') ?
[17:30:29] <jrockjiggz> systemfault: can you give an example?
[17:31:15] <systemfault> var anchor = $('<a></a>'); anchor.append('lol'); $(document.body).append(anchor);
[17:31:50] <jrockjiggz> sweet
[17:34:01] <jrockjiggz> is it OK to use $('<div/>', {class: 'someclassname'});  or $('<div/>').addClass('someclassname'); ?
[17:34:15] <jrockjiggz> are both acceptable
[17:34:54] <robertmaxrees> you can do both.
[17:35:16] <robertmaxrees> doing $('<div/>') creates a fragment that you can treat like any other node.
[17:36:33] <jrockjiggz> robertmaxrees: fragment?  same as.. $('div') ?
[17:36:47] <robertmaxrees> that selects an element that exists.
[17:36:47] <jrockjiggz> uh. no that would be a query
[17:36:58] <jrockjiggz> fragment as jquery object
[17:36:59] <robertmaxrees> if you pass it html, it creates that html in what's called a fragment.
[17:37:08] <robertmaxrees> fragments are DOM objects, actually.
[17:37:18] <robertmaxrees> fragments are a real thing - it's like the window but not rendered.
[17:37:31] <jrockjiggz> interesting, i never knew
[17:37:40] <jrockjiggz> til
[17:37:53] <systemfault> It's worth taking some time to learn the DOM...
[17:37:57] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[17:38:21] <robertmaxrees> so you can create fragments and work against them like any other element, then append them when you're done.
[17:38:57] <BillCriswell> You know how hard it is to only eat two raviolis?
[17:40:15] <robertmaxrees> it's not hard.  it's impossible.
[17:40:52] <BillCriswell> I did it. Only because I threw out the rest of them before I went for the third.
[17:42:33] <jrockjiggz> I seem to be getting [object Object] as html.. not sure why.. http://jsfiddle.net/1ng6ya6a/
[17:43:55] <BillCriswell> jrockjiggz: quote the class property in your attribute object definition thingie.
[17:44:32] <BillCriswell> jrockjiggz: http://jsfiddle.net/1ng6ya6a/1/ I think this is what you want
[17:44:53] <BillCriswell> Can't concat those objects like they're strings or numbers, but luckily append() takes multiple argument jawns.
[17:45:05] <jrockjiggz> BillCriswell: nice
[17:46:02] <BillCriswell> jrockjiggz: Probably want "data-feather-light" instead of dataFeatherLight as well.
[17:46:13] <jrockjiggz> BillCriswell: didn't see the concatenation, thanks
[17:51:37] <kpap> Having a battery fully charged and the laptop plugged in is not harmful, because as soon as the charge level reaches 100% the battery stops receiving charging energy and this energy is bypassed directly to the power supply system of the laptop. Is it right?
[17:52:02] <robertmaxrees> kindasorta.  not exactly.
[17:52:26] <BillCriswell> I don't really get computers so I have no idea.
[17:52:26] <robertmaxrees> depends on how you define "harmful"
[17:54:47] <jrockjiggz> hmm, when i inject the dom elements.. css is misaligned until i minimize and maximize the browser.. grr
[17:55:16] <jrockjiggz> fubar
[17:55:40] <robertmaxrees> shouldn't be unless you're running some logic on window resize.
[17:56:25] <jrockjiggz> robertmaxrees: actual I am. haha good call, yes that was it.

[19:20:06] <megaTherion> Im trying to get a dialog text, the dialog shows up with buttons etc. but no text (except title)...
[19:20:30] <jrockjiggz> is there a way to simulate bandwidth latency in chrome dev tools?
[19:47:53] <sammych> so, if you take a TR out of document flow, it loses it's column width matching
[19:48:05] <sammych> this is ultra annoying, but not unexpected
[19:48:16] <sammych> would be pretty funky, though

[20:03:04] <mozzie42_> hello world (sorry for my english, it's not my native language)
[20:04:07] <mozzie42_> how to catch the event when I click on a anchor link? (type <a href="#toto">my link</a>)
[20:08:12] <thinkxl_> mozzie42_: hablas espa;ol?
[20:08:34] <mozzie42_> thinced, no, I speak french
[20:08:41] <thinkxl_> oh ok
[20:08:42] <mozzie42_> thinkxl, sory
[20:08:56] <thinkxl_> mozzie42_: $('a').on('click', function() {});
[20:09:14] <thinkxl_> mozzie42_: $('a').on('click', function(event) { event });
[20:09:33] <mozzie42_> thinkxl, I'm a newbee in jquery (this night)
[20:09:40] <mozzie42_> I'll see that.
[20:09:43] <thinkxl_> ok
[20:18:02] <mozzie42_> thinkxl,
[20:18:03] <mozzie42_>         $('a').on('click', function()
[20:18:03] <mozzie42_>         {
[20:18:03] <mozzie42_>             alert("toto");
[20:18:03] <mozzie42_>         })
[20:18:18] <mozzie42_> when I click on a link, no alert :'(
[20:18:32] <systemfault> Pasting your code on the channel is a great way to make yourself hated.
[20:18:53] <systemfault> Use a live pastebin website next time... like jsfiddle.net or codepen.io or jsbin.com
[20:19:01] <mozzie42_> ok, sorry
[20:19:31] <systemfault> mozzie42_: Is that code inside a $(document).ready(function() { CODEHERE }); block?
[20:20:55] <mozzie42_> http://pastebin.com/kK4Jz4Cn
[20:21:50] <systemfault> So, you don't have a <a> on the page and wonders why it doesn't work? (I think I misunderstanding the problem)
[20:22:24] <mozzie42_> systemfault, I load a template (navbar) with a lot of <a> balise
[20:22:33] <systemfault> mozzie42_: Ahhhhh
[20:23:05] <mozzie42_> ?
[20:23:25] <systemfault> mozzie42_: When you use .on that way, it only works for <a> that were on the page at the time where you selected them
[20:23:35] <systemfault> In your case, you have none.
[20:23:46] <mozzie42_> ok
[20:24:03] <systemfault> If you want it to work with <a> that are going to be added in the future, you need to use the alternate syntax of .on (event delegation)
[20:24:04] <mozzie42_> so, i need to use the .on in template page?
[20:24:17] <systemfault> $(document).on('click', 'a', function() { alert('toto'); })
[20:25:17] <mozzie42_> thx
[20:30:48] <mozzie42_> systemfault, I have a little problem with this method
[20:31:50] <mozzie42_> When I'm on localhost and i click on <a href="#toto"> $(location).attr('hash') is empty
[20:32:23] <mozzie42_> after if I click on <a href="#tata">  $(location).attr('hash') equal toto
[20:32:28] <mozzie42_> :/
[20:36:54] <mozzie42_> $('a[href = "toto"]').click(function(){} // problem mi solved
[20:39:46] <hooligan321> heh i think i am going to migrate from jquery.migrate
[20:41:21] <hooligan321> you dont really need it right? its just for older ajax code, some asp non sense and preserving the $browser variable?
[20:43:42] <hooligan321> ah nope
[20:43:51] <hooligan321> it also does something for .live
[20:44:44] <hooligan321> ah because i should be using on
[21:12:52] <rahuldroy_work> hey guys, can someone please tell me the selected code is being executed multiple times? http://pastie.org/9472178#11-19
[21:26:42] <hooligan321> hm whats a good up2date color picker
[21:27:47] <hooligan321> the one i was just using is depending on $.browser so thats probably enough of a indicator its time to upgrade
[21:28:25] <hooligan321> and datepicker as well
[21:32:26] <shoky> hooligan321: i've been happy with spectrum color picker http://bgrins.github.io/spectrum/
[21:36:00] <rainabba> I've got an activated() handler for an accordion but apparently accordion() overwrites the IDs I set on the panels to be able to identify that at runtime so how do I determine if a particular panel has been clicked in the activated() handler? The only solution I can come up with is adding a data- attribute to the panels (divs) but it seems like something that should be well handled already for
[21:36:01] <rainabba> such an old and common ui element (same issue would exist with tabs).
[21:53:57] <shoky> rainabba: it doesn't overwrite the IDs tho
[22:03:42] <rainabba> shoky: Of course not :)  Ever noticed how I'm only here in the evenings with silly questions. Those are the days I'm working WAY too long and hard ;/
[22:03:47] <rainabba> Thank you sir.
[22:05:28] <rainabba> It looks like my id is exposed through ui.newPanel['0'].id but using 0 as an object name strikes me as odd. Is that the only way to reference? I can't use ui.newPanel.0.id because that's not a valid name (numeric object name).
[22:11:10] <shoky> rainabba: ui.newPanel is a jquery object
[22:11:55] <shoky> rainabba: doing [0] gets the first element in the collection, like in $('div')[0]    but you can just do:  ui.newPanel.prop('id')
[22:12:38] <rainabba> newPanel isn't an array though so [0] didn't occur to me and that's quite different from ['0'] (which works) right?
[22:12:53] <shoky> jquery objects are array-like
[22:12:55] <shoky> always
[22:13:34] <shoky> there's nothing different going on here.  ['0'] and [0] are the same
[22:13:46] <rainabba> Okay. I see. is .prop('id') "better" or more correct?
[22:13:48] <shoky> it's a jquery object wrapping one element
[22:14:01] <shoky> it's more expressive of what you're doing
[22:14:10] <shoky> you're getting the id from the newPanel
[22:14:18] <rainabba> newPanel has more to it than just [0] though which is what threw me.
[22:14:19] <shoky> putting a zero in tehre is just weird.
[22:14:35] <shoky> it's a jquery object. it has whatever jquery objects have
[22:15:43] * rainabba nods and moves on
[22:15:44] <Zak> is there a way to search the current item as well as the descendants?
[22:15:53] <Zak> e.g. $stuff.find('.foo')
[22:16:12] <rainabba> $stuff.parent().find('.foo') ?
[22:16:35] <shoky> that would look in stuff's siblings too
[22:16:53] <Zak> yeah, it's also problematic if you're dealing with a node that has no parent
[22:16:53] * rainabba walks away meekly
[22:17:32] <shoky> Zak if it's a detached element then you can just do  $('<div>').append($stuff).find
[22:17:34] <shoky> er
[22:17:39] <shoky> $('<div>').append($stuff).find('.foo')
[22:19:32] <Zak> yeah, good point
[22:19:47] <Zak> i'm just sort of surprised there's no method that does this
[22:57:16] <kate_r> hi
[23:06:19] <Zak> hi
[23:27:56] <hooligan321> ;) good old validator
[23:28:31] <hooligan321> i cant believe how many stray commented out crap i had built
[23:28:33] <hooligan321> up
[23:29:23] <Uhkis> happens
[23:57:04] <prohobo> hey, i'm working on a range selector, and i'm having a peculiar problem... it seems if i have two instances of my range selector on the same page that i can drag elements from one instance to the other (!)
[23:57:25] <prohobo> the parent of the dragged element even changes
[23:58:13] <prohobo> i have nothing in my code even allowing the elements to be moved past a certain point
[23:58:27] <prohobo> is that normal js/jquery behavior?
