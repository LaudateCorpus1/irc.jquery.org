[00:35:27] <Dr-007> now. i am using cross domain iframes so i embeded document.domain = 'the domain' in both domains
[00:36:20] <Dr-007> the error is arising on the domain that is NOT in the iframe
[00:37:17] <Dr-007> and the document.domain matches the domain i am on on the page the error is arising
[00:38:13] <Dr-007> aaah wait
[00:38:26] <Dr-007> the document.domain is not on this page
[06:39:20] <hellyeah> is there a method in jquery for finding css classname of an element?
[07:35:25] <kyshtynbai> Hi everyone! Could you please help me to show a hidden div with jQuery. I select this <div class="hid" style="display: none;>some words</div>   with such a statement: var updated = $(this).parent("div").siblings("div.zbs").html(); and then afeter some Ajax magick I make updated.show() and it doen't appear
[07:35:30] <kyshtynbai> wait
[07:35:34] <kyshtynbai> it actualy does
[07:35:36] <kyshtynbai> sorry
[08:59:11] <jose3_> why isn't my form getting submitted?
[08:59:18] <jose3_> https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/ReOwmNAA/
[09:01:47] <jose3_> I was missing a return statemnet
[09:37:12] <taplar_> hope all had a good easter
[10:09:45] <PsychoBoB> hey guis
[10:09:47] <PsychoBoB> guys
[10:10:05] <PsychoBoB> How I can turn off the resizable on my dialog
[10:10:11] <PsychoBoB> I'm using jquery ui
[10:14:19] <taplar_> http://api.jqueryui.com/dialog/#option-resizable
[10:14:56] <FancyCamel> Okay this happens to me too often. If I'm doing .each over an array, why would it split the strings into individual characters and not just the string value when reading $(this) ?
[10:15:23] <taplar_> example?
[10:15:36] <FancyCamel> ie. ["22", "9", "12"] console logs out ["2", "2"] , ["9"] ["1", "9"]
[10:16:10] <FancyCamel> When I run a function of $.each(myarray,function(){console.log($(this));});
[10:16:36] <taplar_> you wouldn't wrap it in $()
[10:16:39] <taplar_> it's not a dom element
[10:17:34] <FancyCamel> Huh, when I remove that it returns String {0: "2", 1: "2", length: 2, [[PrimitiveValue]]: "22"}
[10:17:54] <FancyCamel> Interesting.
[10:18:28] <FancyCamel> I only ever really interact with dom elements so I never knew that, neat.
[10:18:44] <taplar_> yeah, $() is only meant for dom elements really
[10:18:53] <taplar_> that's why there is a $.each and a $.fn.each
[10:20:41] <FancyCamel> So, do I have to use that like an object then or can I still use (this) to access that actual number. Because I'm using that value to work with another dom element ie $('.some_tags[value='+this+']');
[10:21:08] <FancyCamel> Wondering if I have to instead grab that 'PrimitiveValue' but that's being spit out when I console.log this
[10:21:16] <taplar_> it should work with just 'this'
[10:21:36] <FancyCamel> It appears to, cool :)
[10:21:39] <FancyCamel> TIL!
[10:22:42] <taplar_> also you should surround your value with "" for good measure
[10:22:55] <taplar_> [value="'+ this +'"]
[10:23:03] <FancyCamel> Haha yeah, was just a typo throwing it in the chat here. Thank you though!
[10:46:30] <ollie314> Hi there, Can somebody point me out on a documentation that talk about future chrome and thirds js librairies incompatibility.
[10:46:53] <ollie314> ibrairies incompatibility. My aim is, for instance, to find out when a jquery 1.7 will be obsolete (buggy) according to the chrome version (ex: will 1.7 still compatible with chrome 52)
[10:48:45] <snover> nobody can tell the future
[10:49:34] <ollie314> and there is there already known incompatibilities ?
[10:49:36] <NoiseEee> lies
[10:49:42] <snover> no u
[10:51:42] * taplar_ looks into his crystal ball....... and sees........ lunch at 12
[10:55:04] <ollie314> last uggly question, no end of life scheduled for jquery minor 1 ?
[10:55:16] <ollie314> major 1 sorry
[10:55:21] <ollie314> 1.x.x
[11:00:36] <mickotronic> Hi all, I've got a function that does stuff when a radio input is changed (as below): $('input:radio').change(function() {	
[11:00:52] <mickotronic> But how do I make sure this can work for other input types?
[11:01:03] <mickotronic> eg checkbox,text
[11:01:20] <taplar_> what does it do?
[11:04:24] <mickotronic> I guess it doesn't really matter what it does, as long as it is executed when the appropriate input is changed
[11:04:41] <taplar_> ok, well, checkboxes don't really fire a changed event
[11:05:08] <taplar_> you'd have to do a click event for those most likely
[11:05:18] <taplar_> but you wouldn't want to catch click for your other elements
[11:05:20] <mickotronic> Oh damn
[11:05:30] <taplar_> so you'd probably want two different bindings that both use the same handler
[11:06:29] <taplar_> as far as making them all work the same, that all depends on what your doing.  somethings might not make sense for the different input types
[11:07:31] <mickotronic> Well the function at the moment checks a hash table of radio input ids and their dependent inputs, and disables/enables them depending on the parent input's value
[11:08:01] <mickotronic> But I wanted to extend that to work also for text and checkbox. Maybe I need more than one handler but calling the same function(s)
[11:08:13] <taplar_> i'd think so
[11:08:33] <taplar_> actually the handler could be the same
[11:08:43] <taplar_> since your after value which would be on all those types
[11:08:55] <taplar_> just the bindings would differ
[11:09:17] <taplar_> or just one
[11:09:28] <mickotronic> So you reckon that's the best way to go atm? So if checkboxes don't fire a changed event, how do I check whether it has 'changed'?
[11:09:43] <taplar_> click should do it
[11:09:54] <taplar_> clicking a checkbox would result in a change
[11:09:59] <taplar_> unless it's disabled of course
[11:10:31] <taplar_> actually hold on i may be lying
[11:10:34] <taplar_> my console is being stupid
[11:11:04] <taplar_> hah, fk, nvm, -_-
[11:11:08] <taplar_> they do fire a change
[11:11:14] <taplar_> so your good, :)
[11:11:46] * taplar_ needs more coffee
[11:12:09] <mickotronic> So I could do (pseudocode as I don't know the syntax) $(input[type='radio',type='checkbox',type='text']).change(function() {
[11:12:25] <taplar_> personally i'd put a class on them
[11:12:41] <taplar_> and use on('change', function(){...
[11:14:20] <taplar_> $('.evaluateDOMAINELEMENTStateShouldChange').on('change', ....
[11:14:27] <mickotronic> Ok that sounds reasonable
[11:14:27] <mickotronic> Although some inputs already have a class
[11:14:40] <taplar_> so you can target them all at once and it provides some context into your business need
[11:16:20] <taplar_> + self documentation
[11:20:49] <mickotronic> Sorry that last part confused me
[11:22:00] <mickotronic> Oh right
[11:22:10] <mickotronic> *facepalms self*
[11:22:12] <mickotronic> Got it
[11:23:29] <taplar_> :)
[11:25:10] <taplar_> $('.userControls').on('change', evaluateIfOptionalControlsShouldBeEnabled);  is much nicer than $(':text, :radio, :checkbox).on('change', function(){ ... });
[11:32:52] <mickotronic> thanks taplar, very much appreciated
[11:33:07] <taplar_> hope it helps
[11:49:38] <Enerel> anyone teach me how to create submenu?
[11:50:40] <Enerel> ul li ul{display:none;} li:hover > ul{display:block;} but that does not work
[11:57:07] <Enerel> i have menu it is in the div but submenu is appearing under content div why?
[11:57:55] <taplar_> ##css might be able to answer you better
[11:58:17] <Enerel> oops wrong channel
[12:25:42] <robertmaxrees> weeeee
[12:28:37] <taplar_> will rock you
[12:29:50] <taplar_> didn't start the fire
[12:30:31] <taplar_> came, weeeee saw....
[12:30:36] * taplar_ continues babbling
[12:30:58] * robertmaxrees claps
[12:30:59] <robertmaxrees> well done.
[12:32:00] <taplar_> almost threw in a "kend at bernies"
[12:32:11] <robertmaxrees> boom
[13:18:33] <SpecialTechnique> Any good UX/Dev agencies in NYC that I can refer too?
[13:20:23] <taplar_> odd jquery question
[13:22:02] <SpecialTechnique> very odd, but I figured I'd rather hear it from here than google.
[13:22:27] <robertmaxrees> eh, you're not likely to get a ton of responses here.
[13:22:47] <SpecialTechnique> yea I asked in ##design too
[13:36:25] <mchu> hey guys, how do i style/id/class to an ajax reponse? can someone take a look . https://jsfiddle.net/bwwxnxpf/
[13:36:33] <mchu> line 7
[13:36:37] <robertmaxrees> use css
[13:36:55] <rochadt> robertmaxrees++
[13:38:27] <mchu> use css inside that ajax call?
[13:38:32] <robertmaxrees> no.
[13:38:40] <robertmaxrees> use actual css.  no need to do anything with your CS.
[13:38:40] <mchu> oh in my jade
[13:39:06] <robertmaxrees> in your CSS>
[13:39:12] <robertmaxrees> not your html or anything else.
[13:39:19] <robertmaxrees> you should have a stylesheet that you're linking in.
[13:39:44] <mchu> robertmaxrees: i do, but the issue is that #error-message exists in the html as “blank”
[13:39:57] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[13:40:00] <mchu> if i style it, the error message will appear as a blank with some background color
[13:40:03] <wa5ted> hey I am trying to create a toggle by which there is two way binding between checkboxes and multiple select: the bind from checkbox to control multiple select works but not the other way. can someone help me: http://jsfiddle.net/rohanbhangui/zk8o0gtq/
[13:40:21] <mchu> robertmaxrees: so i onyl want the styling/css to appear after the ajax call
[13:40:28] <wa5ted> specifically lines 34 - 46
[13:40:40] <taplar_> mchu: hide it by default and conditionally show it
[13:40:44] <mchu> robertmaxrees: thats what i want to addClass to it in the ajax call
[13:40:50] <arc_> use show() not addclass
[13:40:55] <robertmaxrees> wat
[13:40:56] <wa5ted> what i have tried: doing an if else toggle and doing an inline invert toggle (as seen currently)
[13:41:01] <robertmaxrees> use addClass.
[13:41:20] <mchu> taplar_: yeah tried that already, but i’m using jade… and im having issues with jade and javascript conditionals
[13:41:37] <mchu> right. so does this work? with add class
[13:41:39] <mchu>               $('#error-message').html(response.message).addClass('alert.alert-danger.alert-dismissable');
[13:41:42] <mchu> woops
[13:41:58] <mchu> https://jsfiddle.net/bwwxnxpf/1/
[13:42:08] <mchu> well that doesnt work but it’s what i tried with addClass
[13:42:30] <mchu> im trying to add .alert-danger to it
[13:43:18] <robertmaxrees> right, thatl doesn't work - you need to find the content you care about.
[13:43:39] <mchu> robertmaxrees: hmm what do you mean.
[13:43:48] <mchu> the response is the content
[13:43:55] <robertmaxrees> $(')
[13:44:07] <robertmaxrees> err - $('selectorhere').addClass('lol');
[13:46:37] <wa5ted> any ideas?
[13:48:02] <robertmaxrees> wa5ted for starters for(var val in values) { is bad.
[13:48:20] <robertmaxrees> for is gross.  also values is a string.
[13:49:37] <wa5ted> its an array
[13:49:45] <robertmaxrees> how are you getting an array there?
[13:49:52] <wa5ted> my select is multiple
[13:49:57] <wa5ted> jquery returns an array
[13:50:06] <wa5ted> no?
[13:50:09] <robertmaxrees> aaaah. yeah either way - for loops are bad.  you have an array, not an object.
[13:50:56] <wa5ted> okay what do you recommend
[13:51:00] <robertmaxrees> forEach
[13:51:20] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/zk8o0gtq/17/ not perfect but it'll get you a step closer.
[13:51:24] <wa5ted> oh its been deprecated
[13:51:28] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[13:51:52] <taplar_> i think there's a logic hole too.  for the select i think you want to reverse what your looping over.
[13:52:02] <wa5ted> for...each
[13:52:07] <wa5ted> according to mdn
[13:52:09] <robertmaxrees> wa5ted no.
[13:52:10] <robertmaxrees> forEach
[13:52:12] <arc_> mchu addclass takes a string which is just the class name, not a selector
[13:52:12] <robertmaxrees> the array method.
[13:52:20] <mchu> got it ! thanks guys
[13:53:04] <DeltaHeavy> wa5ted forEach the higher order function
[13:53:15] <wa5ted> robertmaxrees: i was refering to this article
[13:53:16] <wa5ted> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for_each...in
[13:53:25] <robertmaxrees> wa5ted that is not what i'm talking about.
[13:53:37] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/forEach
[13:53:39] <robertmaxrees> the array method.
[13:54:03] <wa5ted> no when i said deprecated that is what i was refering to
[13:54:13] <robertmaxrees> i know what you were talking about.
[13:54:19] <wa5ted> in  any case thank you :)
[13:54:20] <robertmaxrees> :)
[13:54:24] <wa5ted> how are things otherwise
[13:54:32] <robertmaxrees> eh.  not all that great to be honest.
[13:54:35] <robertmaxrees> you?
[13:55:06] <wa5ted> :O
[13:55:16] <wa5ted> why not? (im good just idling at work and getting paid )
[13:55:42] <robertmaxrees> lots of family stuff.  work's been crazy which is nice since it keeps my mind off of things.
[13:57:13] <wa5ted> thats good, I am the same way: find relief in work
[13:59:07] <wa5ted> robertmaxrees: well hope you have a better week it always gets better from monday :)
[13:59:21] <robertmaxrees> eh, it's been pretty bad for the last year, so we'll see.
[13:59:43] <wa5ted> how come?
[14:00:04] <robertmaxrees> much longer story and one I don't necessarily want to tell in the channel ;)
[14:00:29] <wa5ted> fair enough
[14:00:34] <wa5ted> well hope you have a great 2016 :)
[14:01:14] <taplar_> wa5ted: http://jsfiddle.net/zk8o0gtq/20/
[14:02:14] <Dr-007> good day. im having a little trouble using $.inArray http://pastebin.com/DH5tVuFe
[14:02:56] <Dr-007> its not matching my value even tho it is in the array
[14:03:01] <wa5ted> taplar_: why did you use click instead o change?
[14:03:04] <wa5ted> just curious
[14:03:16] <taplar_> hmm? i didn't change any of the events
[14:03:39] <taplar_> just ln 34 and 37-42
[14:03:55] <robertmaxrees> Dr-007 if(typeof(manager_action_urls) == 'undefined') { just do if (!manager_action_urls)
[14:04:20] <robertmaxrees> and try console logging just the  $.inArray(a.pathname, manager_action_urls)
[14:05:40] <wa5ted> taplar_: oh nvm sorry about that :)
[14:06:17] <wa5ted> taplar_: i dont understand the $answerCheckbox stuff, can you explain
[14:06:29] <taplar_> i selected ahead of time all the checkboxes
[14:06:33] <wa5ted> i see
[14:06:39] <taplar_> so i can reuse those instead of having to look them up each time
[14:07:10] <taplar_> i then make it loop over them to see if they are selected in the select
[14:07:31] <taplar_> if you only loop over the select values, you run into the case where a user selects option3 first time, and then option2
[14:07:40] <taplar_> which if your no longer checking for option3, it would still be checked
[14:09:08] <wa5ted> true, cant you do a reset of all the chcked properties?
[14:09:16] <wa5ted> but i guess thats a dirty way of doing it
[14:09:17] <taplar_> sure
[14:09:21] <taplar_> nah, just different
[14:09:33] <taplar_> you could clear them all and then set based on the looping of the select values
[14:09:45] <wa5ted> okay
[14:11:38] <taplar_> don't even need the inner wrapping: http://jsfiddle.net/zk8o0gtq/21/
[14:14:25] <Dr-007> robertmaxrees, thanks i followed your tips: http://pastebin.com/js0ct6C9
[14:14:41] <Dr-007> but i still dont understand why my $.inArray is matching nothing in my array
[14:14:44] <robertmaxrees> also: you're missing var declarations.
[14:15:01] <robertmaxrees> i'd need to see the data you're working with.
[14:15:33] <Dr-007> the array it is testing on?
[14:15:43] <robertmaxrees> and the string you're testing with.
[14:17:07] <Dr-007> those are being logged to my console window. the string and array, but ill pastebin the source of manager_action_urls. since it is json encoded
[14:17:22] <robertmaxrees> what about the array?
[14:18:13] <Dr-007> yes, i mean ill paste the array
[14:18:17] <Dr-007> and now i see that
[14:18:22] <Dr-007> i figure thats whats wrong with it
[14:18:28] <Dr-007> let me complete the pastebin :)
[14:18:57] <Dr-007> http://pastebin.com/PZ30GH10
[14:19:19] <Dr-007> the urls in the array get escaped
[14:19:27] <Dr-007> so perhabs i should escape the urls i am testing with?
[14:19:42] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[14:21:49] <robertmaxrees> why are you escaping the array like that?
[14:25:23] <taplar_> slash is his favorite guitarist
[14:25:54] <taplar_> ur questioning his luv.  that's unfortunate
[14:28:48] <Dr-007> robertmaxrees; im passing an array from php to javascript. In php manager_action_urls = <?php echo json_encode($php_arr); ?>
[14:28:56] <Dr-007> thats why they're escaped i think
[14:28:56] <robertmaxrees> i don't know php fwow.
[14:29:00] <robertmaxrees> *fwiw
[14:29:08] <taplar_> that just puts it in the json format
[14:29:15] <Dr-007> but i think i better look into that. fix that instead
[14:29:40] <Dr-007> im lost, cant figure out how to escape the urls forwards slashes with a backslash.
[14:29:48] <Dr-007> thanks for your help! once again
[14:30:03] <Dr-007> i'm away from keyboard
[14:30:12] <taplar_> liar
[14:30:15] <robertmaxrees> wat'
[14:30:35] <taplar_> he just typed he was away from his keyboard
[14:32:37] <taplar_> in the words of the iconic backstreet boys, quit playing games with my heart
[14:32:39] <taplar_> brah
[14:53:23] <skypce> hey guys how can i protect some jquery from web site rippers?
[14:53:26] <skypce> i found this
[14:53:28] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[14:53:34] <skypce> http://docs.sonhlab.com/protect-javascript-from-copying/
[14:53:44] <skypce> but i cant do it work with my code
[14:53:48] <robertmaxrees> you basically can't.
[14:54:00] <skypce> you can
[14:54:09] <skypce> i try with all web site ripper
[14:54:09] <skypce> s
[14:54:13] <skypce> to rip this site
[14:54:18] <skypce> www.brightmedia.pl
[14:54:19] <skypce> i cant
[14:54:24] <skypce> exist a way
[14:54:36] <skypce> but this people dont answer my email
[14:54:37] <robertmaxrees> you realize taht your client downloads the JS to run it, right?
[14:54:43] <albedoa> this is insane
[14:55:05] <robertmaxrees> skypce i'm looking at all the js files right now.
[14:55:21] <skypce> yes robertmaxrees
[14:55:28] <skypce> but if you try to rip it
[14:55:31] <robertmaxrees> done.
[14:55:33] <robertmaxrees> next?
[14:55:33] <skypce> with httrack
[14:55:36] <skypce> or darcy
[14:55:41] <skypce> you cant do the site works
[14:55:46] <robertmaxrees> you realize that it's trivial to build something to copy those,r ight?
[14:55:53] <albedoa> skypce are you drunk
[14:55:57] <robertmaxrees> then you change out the ajax calls/whatever loader they're using and call it a day.
[14:56:13] <robertmaxrees> you cannot stop people from copying your JS.  any attempts to do so are completely pointless.
[14:56:49] <skypce> i am building a html site, i have a lot of hours working in it
[14:56:58] <robertmaxrees> And?
[14:57:07] <robertmaxrees> you cannot stop people from copying your HTML/CSS/JS :)
[14:57:11] <robertmaxrees> there's no reason to anyway,.
[14:57:38] <skypce> httrack use robots
[14:57:40] <albedoa> why would you want to stop people from seeing the thing which you spent many hours on and which needs to be seen in order to be used
[14:57:44] <skypce> follow robots
[14:57:54] <robertmaxrees> skypce you realize that you could write your own scraper to fix that, right?
[14:57:57] <robertmaxrees> there's no point.
[14:58:07] <skypce> mmm
[14:58:24] <skypce> i dont know
[14:58:26] <skypce> but some pages
[14:58:28] <robertmaxrees> i do.
[14:58:30] <albedoa> WHAT don't you know
[14:58:32] <robertmaxrees> trust me :)
[14:58:33] <skypce> has something in url
[14:58:41] <skypce> confuse scrapers
[14:58:43] <robertmaxrees> you're thinking of the referrer - i can fake that information.
[14:58:47] <robertmaxrees> you cannot "confuse scrapers"
[14:59:10] <skypce> see this: http://www.brightmedia.pl/?lang=en&site=intro
[14:59:13] <skypce> if you scroll
[14:59:16] <skypce> the url
[14:59:24] <robertmaxrees> i already copied the JS for that site.
[14:59:27] <skypce> in the path of url is the trick
[14:59:27] <robertmaxrees> easy.
[14:59:44] <skypce> when you rip the site with some ripper , it download a lot of index files
[15:00:00] <robertmaxrees> right - it would take somebody not very long to stitch that all back together.
[15:00:42] <skypce> it is not easy
[15:00:48] <skypce> mmm
[15:00:49] <skypce> so
[15:00:49] <robertmaxrees> actually it's pretty trivial.
[15:01:13] <skypce> may be load the site in a frame?
[15:01:20] <robertmaxrees> that doesn't change anything.
[15:01:23] <robertmaxrees> i can easily crawl the frame.
[15:01:28] <skypce> mm
[15:01:33] <robertmaxrees> there's nothing you can do to stop people from copying your site.
[15:01:52] <arc_> you're thinking of this in terms of someone trying to use a tool that rips the site. a tool is not even necessary. the process does not take long to do manually
[15:01:54] <robertmaxrees> the very nature of how web pages work makes it trivial.
[15:02:23] <robertmaxrees> skypce the browser has to download all of those assets to run them - you realize that the computer stores copies of those files, right?
[15:02:45] <skypce> sure
[15:03:08] <skypce> what about ioncube html protect?
[15:03:19] <robertmaxrees> lol
[15:03:25] <robertmaxrees> dude
[15:03:47] <arc_> nobody cares about ripping the frontend of your site, don't worry about it. people have their own shit to work on
[15:03:52] <robertmaxrees> ^^^
[15:03:58] <robertmaxrees> nobody is going to steal your site.
[15:04:02] <decx> please
[15:04:07] <decx> everybody is going to steal your site
[15:04:11] <robertmaxrees> hahahahaha
[15:04:17] <taplar_> i'm tempted to now
[15:04:24] <rtd1123> embed all of your images inside a video player, lol
[15:05:33] <arc_> this is a cool site though, gj
[15:05:55] <rtd1123> it is cool, that's why I just copied the entire thing
[15:07:21] <skypce> it is very easy to rip templates
[15:07:25] <taplar_> i'm gonna steal it, make a another site, and have a page blasting his site for ripping me off
[15:07:26] <robertmaxrees> and the site.
[15:07:45] <skypce> i will found a way to do it more difficult
[15:07:48] <robertmaxrees> skypce trust me, you don't have to worry about any of that until you're very, very large.
[15:07:50] <robertmaxrees> you can't.
[15:07:56] <robertmaxrees> if somebody wants your site, they will take it.
[15:07:59] <robertmaxrees> them's the breaks.
[15:08:11] <robertmaxrees> like, even my company doesn't have to worry about it all that much.
[15:08:33] <arc_> i don't get why you would even care if someone stole it anyway
[15:08:43] <robertmaxrees> in our case it was the product shots that we cared about.
[15:08:45] <arc_> it's not like a direct competitor is going to do that
[15:09:02] <arc_> then it takes one trip to archive.org for them to lose all credibility
[15:09:07] <robertmaxrees> we also had somebody scrape our entire site, but anybody doing that's obviously not doing terribly well to begin with.
[15:09:13] <decx> everybody stole my sitedesigns in 2004 :(
[15:09:19] <decx> it was gradients and rounded borders
[15:10:46] <taplar_> people rip off github all the time
[15:13:04] <skypce> ok thank you guys
[15:43:09] <flashpoint9> How do I get a slidetoggle working so it always slides down?
[15:45:19] <decx> use slideDown instead
[15:49:03] <flashpoint9> decx: I need it to toggle, slidedown can toggle as easily as slideToggle?
[15:49:21] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[15:51:51] <flashpoint9> robertmaxrees: you talking to me?
[15:51:57] <robertmaxrees> yes.
[15:52:13] <flashpoint9> I need it to toggle AND slidedown
[15:52:19] <decx> so toggle
[15:52:30] <robertmaxrees> yeah, so what does the toggle not do?
[15:54:00] <flashpoint9> slideDown isn't toggling
[15:54:11] <robertmaxrees> then use slideToggle.
[15:54:17] <robertmaxrees> i'm really confused about what your problem is.
[15:54:20] <flashpoint9> but slidetoggle is sliding UP
[15:54:23] <flashpoint9> not DOWN
[15:54:33] <robertmaxrees> show us what you mean.
[15:54:35] <flashpoint9> i need it to slide down
[15:57:44] <flashpoint9> robertmaxrees: what do you need to see? what dont you understand about what i was saying?
[15:57:54] <robertmaxrees> per the docs, it slides down.
[15:58:03] <robertmaxrees> so you're saying that it's doing that is contradictory to the docs.
[15:59:44] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/g1e4mcz6/1/
[16:00:04] <robertmaxrees> that's sliding up and down.
[16:01:06] <flashpoint9> robertmaxrees: no no, I mean I have a button and it does slide in and out, the issue is that it needs to slide in a downward direction then back in, its sliding up and back in when clicked
[16:01:30] <flashpoint9> i could not jsfiddle this, its too peculiar and specific to the local site
[16:01:31] <robertmaxrees> O.o show me what you mean.
[16:01:39] <robertmaxrees> because i can't envision the problem you're having.
[16:01:46] <flashpoint9> http://www.potsdam.edu/
[16:01:49] <taplar_> i'm wondering if he doesn't have the display:none on the initial load
[16:01:50] <flashpoint9> go to responsive
[16:01:53] <decx> probably got click on div or something
[16:01:58] <decx> and 2 divs
[16:02:02] <flashpoint9> click campus tools on the right
[16:02:17] <robertmaxrees> then what?
[16:02:32] <flashpoint9> it works exactly like that but it open UPWARD instead of like the example site whic slides downward
[16:02:44] <robertmaxrees> okay - so then what's the issue?
[16:02:56] <flashpoint9> I need it to open downward like in the example
[16:03:03] <decx> look at it
[16:03:08] <decx> the thing you click is just a handle
[16:03:15] <decx> the thing sliding down! is just a div above it
[16:03:56] <robertmaxrees> that's the default behavior - sounds like you need to remove code then.
[16:04:11] <decx> have wee above toggle in the fiddle
[16:04:13] <decx> done
[16:04:35] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/g1e4mcz6/2/ woo and yay?
[16:05:32] <goddard> anyone know how to display all events for a single day on full calender?
[16:10:49] <robertmaxrees> is that a particular plugin?
[16:33:57] <jose3_> hEy!
[16:39:50] <taplar_> salutations
[16:45:56] <jose3_> https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/XDpp5U4n/
[16:46:30] <jose3_> I have another function that appends this like this $(".div").append(randomQuote())
[16:46:51] <jose3_> However this isn't working, how do I append the value from randomQuote()/chuckJoke?
[16:46:53] <taplar_> ajax methods don't 'return'
[16:47:08] <jose3_> even in the success function?
[16:47:16] <taplar_> you should do/call your logic from inside your success handler
[16:48:08] <jose3_> the thing is, I want to use this function multiple times as an error message,
[16:48:27] <taplar_> doesn't change that it is asynchronous
[16:48:28] <jose3_> so my other functions say something like: if there are no results show randomQUote
[16:49:10] <jose3_> when you say 'logic' do you mean the actually appending that I want to do?
[16:49:21] <taplar_> whatever you want to do with the response of the request
[16:51:56] <jose3_> So just to confirm: because this is an ajax method I am unable to return its results. If i want to append chuckJoke, i must do it from within the success handler.
[16:52:04] <taplar_> yes
[16:52:10] <jose3_> okay
[16:52:11] <robertmaxrees> that's not why you can't return, but basically.
[16:52:11] <jose3_> thanks
[16:53:43] <taplar_> robertmaxrees: oh, are you saying the return would be valid for things like following thens and such
[16:54:10] <robertmaxrees> more that you're returning to the calling function, which in this case is ajax itself.
[16:54:23] <taplar_> ah
[16:54:40] <robertmaxrees> small distinction.
[16:54:47] <robertmaxrees> but imo an important one.
[16:54:51] <taplar_> yah
[16:55:12] <jose3_> https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/F2LAHuDc/
[16:55:15] <taplar_> but that's true though right?  if you had chained then() attached it would be provided to the next one?
[16:55:29] <robertmaxrees> iirc yes.
[16:55:47] <robertmaxrees> store $('#newYorkTimes') in a var and use that var instead, jose3_
[16:55:52] <robertmaxrees> reselecting it is bad.
[16:56:09] <robertmaxrees> also: use .map() here instead of the for loop.
[16:59:14] <Uhkis> even better tip: dont append in a loop
[16:59:24] <robertmaxrees> hence the .map() suggestion.
[16:59:35] <robertmaxrees> make an array of elements, .join() them and do a single append.
[17:00:37] <decx> it's been translations, random jokes and now nyt articles. this app must be amazing
[17:00:46] <robertmaxrees> hahahahaha
[17:18:51] <Qiller> hi friends, how can i hide strings between [ and ], like: "Hello my [friend 001, 002]." i want to hide all between [ ]. :)
[17:19:44] <robertmaxrees> a regular expression and .replace()
[17:23:17] <Qiller> robertmaxrees: [ random content ], can i use regular expression with random content into [ between ] ?
[17:23:28] <robertmaxrees> "random content into between"?
[17:23:37] <robertmaxrees> you can use a regex to math everything between [ and ]
[17:24:33] <Qiller> robertmaxrees: ok, ty.
[17:27:07] <shades> hello
[17:27:27] <Qiller> robertmaxrees: what regex is [ ] ? :(
[17:27:37] <robertmaxrees> what do you mean?
[17:27:50] <shades> i have $("#frequency p").append("<p>300</p>"); where frequency is an li item
[17:27:56] <shades> it's not adding it to that line but the line below
[17:28:04] <Qiller> robertmaxrees: i have no idea, regex is [ random ]
[17:28:08] <robertmaxrees> shades do you have multiple #frequency?
[17:28:09] <NoiseEee> [] in regex refers to a group of characters
[17:28:22] <robertmaxrees> NoiseEee he wants the literal [ and ] chars.
[17:28:22] <NoiseEee> shades: you're adding a <p> to a <p>
[17:28:36] <robertmaxrees> he wants all characters between [ and ] in a string.
[17:28:47] <shades> robertmaxrees: no there is only one
[17:28:57] <shades> frequency is an id not a class
[17:28:58] <robertmaxrees> shades NoiseEee got it :) you can't append a p to a p.
[17:29:12] <robertmaxrees> and fwiw - we see people make the multiple id mistake constantly.
[17:29:18] <robertmaxrees> hence my question.
[17:29:24] <shades> how do I append a <p> to my li item
[17:29:45] <robertmaxrees> $("#frequency p") is selecting the child p tag of #frequency.
[17:29:53] <robertmaxrees> remove the p and you're g2g
[17:30:23] <albedoa> how do i delegate an event to elements with a data value set by .data()? $(this.$filters).on('click', [blah], function(e) { ... <— what do i replace [blah] with?
[17:30:35] <robertmaxrees> you can't.
[17:30:37] <shades> robertmaxrees:  	$("#frequency").append("<p>300</p>");
[17:30:42] <albedoa> robertmaxrees ty
[17:30:42] <shades> doesn't work exactly
[17:30:51] <shades> this puts the <p> on a new line
[17:30:55] <shades> not the same one that frequency is
[17:30:59] <robertmaxrees> .data() doesn't modify the dom so those selectors will fail albedoa - use a class or .filter() to get the ones you want.
[17:31:05] <robertmaxrees> shades then fix your selector.
[17:31:09] <robertmaxrees> show us what you're trying to do.
[17:31:16] <shades> I removed the p like you said
[17:31:35] <robertmaxrees> shades i can't divine your markup - show us what you have.
[17:31:44] <shades> i'd like to have the html rendered as: <li id="frequency">Frequency: <p>300</p></li>
[17:31:57] <robertmaxrees> then  	$("#frequency").append("<p>300</p>"); should work fine.
[17:32:16] <robertmaxrees> *should* - i can't remember if there are quirks with text nodes.
[17:32:19] <robertmaxrees> shouldn't be though.
[17:32:20] <arc_> by default <p> will put its contents on a new line
[17:32:27] <arc_> i believe that is what you are saying you don't want
[17:32:28] <robertmaxrees> styling wise, sure.
[17:32:29] <arc_> so use a span then
[17:32:31] <shades> robertmaxrees: that adds the 300 below the * frequency: in the html
[17:32:33] <decx> there's too much pee in this channel
[17:32:40] <shades> I'd like for it to be added on the *SAME* line
[17:32:42] <shades> not the line below
[17:32:47] <robertmaxrees> shades that's a CSS problem then.
[17:32:52] <robertmaxrees> you're conflating display with markup.
[17:32:54] <shades> urgh
[17:32:59] <robertmaxrees> use a span - you don't have a paragraph of text there.
[17:33:24] <decx> yeah that's antisemantic, aipac will go after you
[17:33:29] <robertmaxrees> hahaha
[17:33:29] <shades> span also adds it below * frequency, not on the same line
[17:33:47] <robertmaxrees> then you have something setting display: block; on span tags.
[17:33:50] <robertmaxrees> so fix your css.
[17:34:37] <shades> i added that css and it doesn't do it either
[17:34:41] <robertmaxrees> then show us.
[17:34:44] <robertmaxrees> :)
[17:35:12] <shades> in my css i have span { display: block; }
[17:35:20] <robertmaxrees> you want it to be inline instead.
[17:35:21] <robertmaxrees> no block.
[17:35:22] <robertmaxrees> *not
[17:35:36] <shades> ok
[17:35:40] <shades> i removed some additional stuff
[17:35:41] <Qiller> shades: and how can i remove all into [ ] using regex?
[17:35:42] <shades> now i think it's working
[17:35:51] <robertmaxrees> Qiller what have you tried?
[17:36:22] <decx> google like "regex match between characters"
[17:36:26] <decx> it's like ... easy
[17:36:28] <robertmaxrees> Qiller https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions here is a great resource on regular expressions.
[17:36:38] <robertmaxrees> or do what decx suggested :)
[17:36:54] <arc_> regex is utterly mystifying to me
[17:37:30] <robertmaxrees> yeah, it's pretty confusing
[17:37:48] <Qiller> \[(.*?)\]
[17:37:51] <arc_> i guess it resolves like roman numerals almost lol
[17:37:56] <arc_> idk
[17:37:59] <robertmaxrees> give that a shot Qiller
[17:38:15] <Qiller> yeah \o/ going to use regex \[(.*?)\]
[17:39:57] <decx> expand your search by the word global too
[17:40:01] <albedoa> robertmaxrees https://jsfiddle.net/obutesvo/ am i heading in the right direction? regarding filtering event delegation by .data() attribute
[17:40:29] <decx> nope
[17:40:42] <decx> the target has to be a selector
[17:40:44] <decx> in stringform
[17:40:53] <robertmaxrees> no.  you give it a class and filter within the callback.
[17:41:03] <decx> you just do click, 'li', fn and do your filter in that function
[17:41:09] <decx> if it's not what you want just return from there
[17:41:39] <decx> without the filter even
[17:41:47] <albedoa> k thanks
[17:42:00] <decx> just like if ($(this).data('blah) != 'wurst') return
[17:42:09] <robertmaxrees> oh yeah, or that.
[17:42:27] <albedoa> ha, that's a good approach
[17:42:28] <albedoa> ty
[17:42:34] <robertmaxrees> simpler than i was making it heh.
[17:42:36] <decx> i'm an expert
[17:42:46] <robertmaxrees> dey shud pay u
[17:42:53] <decx> perpendicular selectors and all that
[17:43:04] <robertmaxrees> lel
[17:47:06] <Qiller> var replaced = $("body").html().replace(/\[.*\]/g,''); $("body").html(replaced);
[17:47:09] <Qiller> nice, working fine :D
[17:47:29] <robertmaxrees> woah
[17:47:36] <robertmaxrees> why are you doing that against $('body');
[17:53:10] <Qiller> robertmaxrees: because is into all text of body
[17:53:26] <robertmaxrees> do that server-side then, duder.
[17:53:56] <Qiller> hmm
[17:54:37] <Qiller> robertmaxrees: can i use this $("#div").html().replace(/\[.*\]/g,''); except <img src="... into [ ] ?
[17:55:05] <robertmaxrees> sounds like you're doing it to everything on a page.
[17:55:06] <robertmaxrees> why?
[18:04:43] <arc_> div is a pretty weird id
[18:05:51] <Qiller> robertmaxrees: thanks =*
[18:06:22] <robertmaxrees> huh
[18:09:28] <robertmaxrees> welp
[18:50:25] <viscera> What's the correct way to write a jQuery selector for the value of a button element, e.g. <button type='button'>Foo</button> ? Do I want :contains('Foo') ?
[18:50:39] <robertmaxrees> value or text?
[18:52:48] <viscera> Aren't they the same for button elements? Whatever Foo is in the example above, I'm guessing text...
[18:53:04] <robertmaxrees> you can do contains, sure.
[19:00:14] * viscera tests
[19:00:39] <viscera> robertmaxrees: thanks!
[19:17:35] <syosoft> hey guys, anyone familiar with the plugin selectivity? I'm trying to clear it when a radio button is clicked but i keep getting the error "Cannot call method on element without Selectivity instance" - I don't see anything about that in Google, and as far as I can tell... the element *does* have a selectivity instance... http://pastebin.ca/3414541
[20:01:40] <syosoft> ok, so I figured out why it's failing, or rather, how to stop it from failing....but shouldnt these two be the same? Any idea why the plugin would treat them differently? Doesn't work: $('[name="model_id"]').selectivity('clear'); Does work: $('#model_id').selectivity('clear');
[20:02:12] <robertmaxrees> are you using the id or attribute selector when initializing?
[20:02:34] <syosoft> they were both attribute at first, now they're both id.
[20:02:50] <robertmaxrees> do you have multiple elements with that name value?
[20:02:58] <syosoft> nope, VERY small form.
[20:03:03] <robertmaxrees> dunno then.
[20:03:09] <syosoft> Yea, strikes me as odd too.
[20:03:31] <syosoft> But... shouldn't they be the same/interchangeable?
[20:03:37] <robertmaxrees> not necessarily.
[20:03:54] <robertmaxrees> i mean, they should, but i don't know what that plugin does/how it does it/etc.
[20:04:30] <syosoft> Huh. well, that strikes me as odd ;) right, neither do I. I threw something up on their github issues page, now that I have it working, i'm ok using the ID, now it's just a matter of curiosity.
[20:04:49] <robertmaxrees> also: you should actively avoid using attribute selectors.
[20:05:29] <syosoft> Yes, i'm aware. I just utilize JS as little as possible, so I dont have elements targetable by id by default.
[20:05:46] <robertmaxrees> you should give them IDs or Classes that describe them and then target those.
[20:14:13] <Zix> is there a way to test if $(this) matches a selector (e.g. test if $(this) matches $(.nine))
[20:14:29] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/is/
[20:14:32] <robertmaxrees> :)
[20:14:59] <Zix> ok thank you very much
[20:20:06] * robertmaxrees whistles
[20:20:17] <robertmaxrees> yeesh waiting on ELB is the worst sometimes.
[20:28:13] <Dr-008> how do i get my $('.some_div').html(); contents with the div im using as reference aswell?
[20:28:45] <Dr-008> is there a function that fetches all html attributes of a div at once?
[20:28:57] <bluenoser> .parent().html() i guess
[20:29:03] <robertmaxrees> you want the outer html?
[20:29:06] <bluenoser> not sure
[20:29:18] <Dr-008> robertmaxrees, i think so
[20:29:26] <robertmaxrees> parent().html() gets you the current AND siblings.
[20:29:30] <bluenoser> ah right
[20:29:38] <bluenoser> element.outerHTML
[20:29:46] <Dr-008> yeah thats what im having now, all siblings
[20:29:52] <steveoh> hey how does .html() work when the id is a script tag?
[20:29:54] <robertmaxrees> .prop('outerHTML') or just the outerHTML property.
[20:30:06] <Dr-008> thanks
[20:30:22] <robertmaxrees> steveoh what do you mean?
[20:30:38] <steveoh> i don't want to use jquery but i see folkds using a script tag for a mustache template
[20:30:59] <robertmaxrees> steveoh so then you don't have a jquery question?
[20:31:10] <steveoh> so i'm wondering if it's somethign more complicated than document.getElementById('id').innerText or html
[20:31:16] <steveoh> well i can't find the .html methods in the source code
[20:31:20] <robertmaxrees> for what?
[20:31:26] <robertmaxrees> jquery? or something else?
[20:31:29] <steveoh> jquery
[20:31:38] <robertmaxrees> https://api.jquery.com/html/
[20:31:45] <steveoh> i don't care about the api, i want to see the code
[20:32:19] <robertmaxrees> so you don't want to use jquery but you want to see the source for .html()?  are you thinking about just copyign taht and using only that?
[20:32:32] <steveoh> i want to see how it works yeah
[20:32:45] <robertmaxrees> why not just use the native DOM methods at that point?
[20:33:00] <steveoh> because i'm not sure if there is anythign special when it is a script tag
[20:34:03] <steveoh> do you know where the .html method source code is? i can't find it on github
[20:34:29] <robertmaxrees> i really don't understand why you're stuck on that - it's in there somewhere, but i'd just find a native js way to do it instead.
[20:34:50] <steveoh> you're not being very helpful at all
[20:35:05] <steveoh> i'm trying to validate if my vanilla js way is the way jquery is doing it
[20:35:27] <steveoh> which i already mentioned above. if it's innerText on the script node
[20:35:41] <robertmaxrees> i don't understand why you care about the way jquery does it, though.
[20:35:57] <steveoh> because its battle tested and handles corner cases that i may not have thought of
[20:36:16] <robertmaxrees> you realize that the jquery source is going to have more going ont han just one method, right?
[20:36:29] <steveoh> yeah i realize that
[20:39:51] <robertmaxrees> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/b0b280cd61d1fa12b67bd723ac2c2fa91b92db01/src/manipulation.js#L392-L429
[20:40:04] <robertmaxrees> also: jquery it MIT licensed iirc.
[20:40:06] <steveoh> i never would have thought to look in manipulation thanks robertmaxrees
[20:40:17] <robertmaxrees> so make sure you follow the terms there.
[20:40:30] <steveoh> i'm not copy and pasting code - don't worry
[20:40:56] <robertmaxrees> derivative works are included fwiw. and you don't need everything .html() will give you.
[20:41:13] <steveoh> do you konw what the elem.nodeType === 1 enum means?
[20:41:26] <steveoh> it looks like it's using inner html always
[20:41:30] <robertmaxrees> that's not an enum.
[20:41:39] <robertmaxrees> and https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Node/nodeType
[20:42:00] <steveoh> script tags are of type 1
[20:42:02] <steveoh> ok cool
[20:42:13] <robertmaxrees> also: beware of old browsers.
[20:42:23] <steveoh> they aren't my problem
[20:42:31] <steveoh> but thanks for the warning
[20:46:49] <steveoh> hah, my problem was jekyll was thinking my mustache templates were liquid templates... sigh into face palm
[22:30:59] <viscera> Say in mainPage.html I've got $("#mainPageDiv").load("childPage.html"). Now, over in otherPage.html, I want to $("#mainPageDiv").show(), but only once the .load() finishes. How to? I'm thinking Document.readyState somehow?
[22:31:20] <viscera> i.e. otherPage.html checks the readyState of #mainPageDiv or something
[22:31:40] <viscera> I'm happy for the .show() to wait on the .load() in other words
[23:19:41] <viscera> Figured it out. I just hid the UI content causing the race condition and showed it in the load callback
