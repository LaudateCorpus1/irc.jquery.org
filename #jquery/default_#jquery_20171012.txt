[01:18:47] <d3m0n> V7, thanks but I actually want the html tag not the actual name of the tag heh :)
[01:19:03] <d3m0n> like appending <img class="image"> to the .someclas
[01:19:04] <V7> What do you mean ?
[01:19:08] <V7> oh
[01:20:12] <V7> outerHTML
[01:20:59] <V7> $('<img>', { class: 'image', html: data, alt: 'Image' }).outerHTML( )
[01:21:19] <W0LF> i'm pretty new to js, and i have functioning code in a file, but i'd like to wrap it as recommended for drupal 8 as described here - https://www.drupal.org/node/2269515. I have a pastee with the current code and the framework here - https://paste.ee/p/oHfRJ, i'm just unsure of how exactly to put it in
[01:24:04] <d3m0n> v7 I am not exactly sure that will work because it's still inside jquery's append and doesnt recognize outerHTML
[01:24:30] <d3m0n> https://codepen.io/jstn/pen/MEBKgz
[01:25:55] <V7> d3m0n: I guess that can't append selector
[01:26:01] <V7> Yu need to creat an element
[01:26:05] <V7> create *
[01:26:29] <V7> $( ) is selector
[01:26:37] <V7> d3m0n: $( "p" ).add( "div" ).addClass( "widget" );
[01:27:12] <d3m0n> Got it, $('<img>', { class: 'image', html: data, alt: 'Image' }).prop('outerHTML')
[01:27:26] <V7> This's wrong
[01:27:34] <V7> It'll work, but it's how it does
[01:27:40] <d3m0n> Really? https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5744207/jquery-outer-html
[01:27:42] <V7> it's not I mean
[01:28:06] <V7> oh satcjoverflow ...
[01:28:17] <V7> Look at this "Just use ... "
[01:28:34] <d3m0n> Can't because it's still inside jquery append :)
[01:28:39] <V7> d3m0n: StackOverflow is good, but there're a lot of "hackers"
[01:29:07] <V7> Told you use add
[01:29:41] <d3m0n> Yea I'll try that cause it does look cleaner to me
[01:30:48] <d3m0n> Aside: IRC has a lot of "hackers" too XD
[01:31:19] <V7> ^ old "hackers"
[01:31:34] <d3m0n> Good point
[01:36:43] <W0LF> any js knowledgeables able to help with some code formatting?

[04:27:21] <einr> hi all -- perhaps someone can help me figure out how to stop jquery from escaping quotes when using .attr(), .append() etc. i would like to be able to set the attribute of a tag to a literal string with no conversions but jquery keeps replacing my " characters with &quot; etc. https://jsfiddle.net/dezg66cy/ illustrates the problem -- see source of generated html. (and i know this is not the correct way to set an onclick handler, but it w
[04:28:00] <Cork> einr: jquery doesn't escape it
[04:28:05] <einr> what does, then?
[04:28:16] <Cork> the dom does
[04:28:29] <einr> how do i avoid this?
[04:28:33] <Cork> if you want to store data assosiated with a dom element without any string convertion use .data()
[04:29:44] <Cork> einr: also i would strongly recommend not to use onclick; at all
[04:29:57] <Cork> come into the 2k's please...
[04:30:19] <einr> i do realize that, the actual code is not onclick() but i figured it would be an illustrative demo ;)
[04:30:44] <Cork> einr: https://jsfiddle.net/dezg66cy/3/
[04:32:48] <einr> that's not doing exactly what i need. i don't need to set a click handler, i need to output literal quotes to the attribute of a tag. so i guess i need to look into .data().
[04:33:17] <Cork> einr: data doesn't put the data as attributes
[04:33:22] <Cork> that is why it can store anything
[04:33:39] <Cork> einr: you can't put quotes in an attribute, it just isn't possible
[04:35:04] <einr> but if i write raw html, i should be able to do something like <p data-foo='there are "quotes" in this string'>, no?
[04:35:10] <Cork> einr: an element is defined as <tag attribute="value"> so if you want to put a " inside the attribute it has to be escaped
[04:35:11] <einr> that's what i want to replicate
[04:35:26] <Cork> einr: ya, except it gets escaped by the error correction of the browser
[04:35:48] <Cork> to <p data-foo="there are &quote;quotes&quote; in this string">
[04:35:54] <einr> but it's still valid to write <a onclick='javascript:alert("boo!");'>
[04:35:59] <einr> that's not escaped by the browser
[04:36:55] <Cork> einr: https://jsfiddle.net/6nf0u22x/
[04:37:53] <Cork> einr: the engine decodes the text before it is eval:ed as javascript
[04:37:56] <einr> okay, point taken, but quoted or not, it is parsed correctly and does throw up the alert
[04:38:15] <Cork> einr: just don't use event attributes
[04:38:19] <einr> so whether or not it's a good idea -- is it possible to replicate that dynamically with jquery?
[04:38:19] <Cork> and all your problems would go away
[04:39:26] <einr> i'm sure there's a much saner way to do what i'm trying to do, but the actual code is too complex for me to paste or explain it i'm afraid
[04:50:50] <einr> wow i replaced my stupid attribute code with .data() equivalents and all my problems went away
[04:50:57] <einr> ty
[05:30:27] <V7> Hey ;) This's an issue. Which's with dataTables and SlideDown SlideUp child rows which I've tried to fix within 2 days, but nothing ...

[05:30:45] <V7> So ... if anyone could help
[05:34:52] <hellyeah> is there an event for selecting all text inside div_?
[05:35:05] <Cork> an event?
[05:35:12] <Cork> you mean if the user click ctrl+a?
[05:35:17] <hellyeah> yes
[05:35:27] <hellyeah> you know in the forum
[05:35:29] <Cork> bind a keydown event handler
[05:35:35] <hellyeah> there is select all
[05:35:49] <hellyeah> when you click it you select all texts
[05:35:57] <hellyeah> keydown okay
[05:38:33] <hellyeah> like that https://jsfiddle.net/n95rjw18/ ?
[05:39:16] <Duikb00t> Hola
[05:39:30] <hellyeah> o≈ü
[05:39:32] <hellyeah> oi
[05:40:06] <hellyeah> keydown or mousedown Cork
[05:40:07] <hellyeah> ?
[05:41:14] <Cork> hellyeah: you can't use mousedown to track selection
[05:41:44] <Cork> there was events for selection, but i don't remember if those has been deprecated cause of security problems
[05:42:26] <Cork> ah, ya the select event
[05:42:37] <Cork> donno if it fires from the menu action though
[05:42:40] <Cork> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/select+

[05:45:38] <Duikb00t> I have a simple Q:
[05:45:49] <Duikb00t> I would like to tdefine a nth-child
[05:45:53] <Duikb00t> Currenty this line works:
[05:45:54] <Duikb00t> var $timeLine = $('.ul_timeline-wrapper li');
[05:46:04] <Duikb00t> var $timeLine = $('.ul_timeline-wrapper li:nth-child(5)');
[05:46:25] <Duikb00t> That nth-child($VAR)  is something I would like to add with jQuery is that possible?
[05:46:27] <Duikb00t> eq?
[05:47:08] <Duikb00t> Seems to work :D
[05:47:11] <Duikb00t> console.log($timeLine.eq(count).find('a').css('border', '5px solid red'));
[05:49:10] <hellyeah> Cork:  problem is i use highlight.js and i need div. select event doesnt work for a div
[05:49:18] <hellyeah> Duikb00t:  what is the question?
[05:49:39] <hellyeah> you want to change css of spesific element?
[05:49:40] <Cork> ya, the select elements only work for form elements (and content editable)
[05:50:12] <Cork> Duikb00t: just concat it into the string
[05:50:24] <Cork> just make sure it is safe to be used in a selector though
[05:50:41] <Cork> var timeLine = $('.ul_timeline-wrapper li:nth-child(' + number + ')');
[05:50:56] <webgiant> hello guys
[05:51:36] <hellyeah> hey
[05:51:39] <webgiant> Do you know a jquery plugin that link value of tw cell in a table row
[05:51:55] <webgiant> Do you know a jquery plugin that link value of two cells in a table row
[05:53:13] <webgiant> for example I have A1 and B1 row cell and C1 Tot, when A1 and B1 chang C1 update its result and when result changes B1 and A1 update their value
[05:55:12] <webgiant> nobody knows how can do it
[05:56:03] <d3m0n> $('.a1').change(){..}, $('.b1').change(){..}
[05:58:45] <Cork> except you don't get change event when a table changes
[05:59:33] <Cork> webgiant: you would have to either use a function from this plugin to update the cells or it would have to be timerbased
[05:59:48] <Cork> webgiant: so i would prob just recommend to write a small function for just that
[06:03:41] <Duikb00t> ahyeah
[06:03:44] <Duikb00t> working nice
[06:04:16] <Duikb00t> https://kopy.io/7Vx1U  this works.
[06:04:37] <Duikb00t> But this is just a prototype, I will now setup a CSS class and remove /add it
[06:04:42] <Cork> Duikb00t: .eq != nth-child
[06:04:44] <Duikb00t> which is cleaner then this inline test stuff
[06:04:46] <Duikb00t> oh
[06:04:48] <Duikb00t> But it works oO
[06:05:00] <Duikb00t> It's just the N'th element I need inside a div
[06:05:03] <Cork> eq gives you the nth MATCH not child
[06:05:04] <Duikb00t> so EQ might be ok?
[06:05:06] <webgiant> ok thank you
[06:05:41] <Cork> so nth-child can give you multiple results while eq will give you the nth index of the result set no matter if they are child x or y
[06:05:55] <Duikb00t> aaah yeah
[06:05:58] <Duikb00t> ok
[06:06:10] <Cork> many actually want eq when they use nth-child
[06:06:10] <Duikb00t> so if the structer is like ( dummy example )
[06:06:17] <Cork> but css doesn't have an equiv
[06:06:19] <Duikb00t> oh
[06:06:21] <Duikb00t> yeah
[06:06:23] <Duikb00t> I understand it.
[06:06:25] <Duikb00t> Thanks!
[06:06:27] <Duikb00t> :D
[06:06:29] <webgiant> I wrote my function and I tried jquery calx but when I edit a row value the cell of previous row update itself to zero value
[06:06:57] <webgiant> have you ever used jquery-calx
[06:06:59] <webgiant> ?
[06:07:23] <Cork> Duikb00t: but ex <div><span class="a1">1</span><span class="a2">2</span></div><div><span class="a1">3</span><span class="a2">4</span></div>
[06:07:50] <Cork> 'div :nth-child(2)' will give you both class="a2"
[06:08:10] <Cork> while .eq(2) will give you the a1 from the second div
[06:08:15] <Cork> so they are quite different
[06:08:50] <Cork> ($('div :nth-child') vs $('div').children().eq(2))
[06:09:01] <Cork> opps
[06:09:04] <Cork> ($('div :nth-child(2)') vs $('div').children().eq(2))
[06:19:37] <Duikb00t> ok that makes sense :D
[06:29:36] <d3m0n> Hey Cork, we were talking the other day about how I can pass a variable to be used as an object key name, I tried the solution you provided but I am getting a "TypeError: value.images[image_type] is undefined" error. https://codepen.io/jstn/pen/rGrmBe
[06:31:29] <d3m0n> Or perhaps anyone else should shed some light
[06:31:49] <d3m0n> s/should/could
[07:06:39] <EugenA> onclick on element A I show div B with some content. I need to implement "click somewhere else to close B". I'm looking for a way to close B without close-button
[07:07:42] <EugenA> i thought maybe I could play with focus / lostfocus-Event, but it is not working
[07:11:13] <EugenA> I need tabindex :-)
[07:11:18] <ChrisCwmbran> Hello peeps. Whats the jquery to enable all dropdowns on a screen that have an option with a value set please?
[07:11:19] <EugenA> attribute
[07:11:25] <Cork> EugenA: a common solution is $(document).on('click.cleanup', function(event) { if($(event.target).closest(me).length > 0) { return; }/* cleanup */ $(document).off('.cleanup'); })
[07:12:00] <Cork> "me" is meant to be the element where you don't want it to hide it again if you click
[07:13:01] <Cork> ChrisCwmbran: $('select').not(function() { return this.value == "" }).prop('disabled', false)
[07:13:08] <Cork> opps
[07:13:11] <Cork> inverted it
[07:13:15] <Cork> ChrisCwmbran: $('select').filter(function() { return this.value == "" }).prop('disabled', false)
[07:13:32] <ChrisCwmbran> Thank you
[07:13:35] <Cork> actually, it should be inverted >_<'
[07:13:48] <Cork> the later enables all that has nothing selected, the former enables the other
[07:15:05] <ChrisCwmbran> Ok cool :) Thank you for your help! Works like a dream!
[07:15:24] <hellyeah> hey
[07:16:17] <hellyeah> hmm what is the event on mobile for that kind of thing. You just touch and hold your finger for a sec and menu appears for copying text. Do you know that?
[07:16:46] <Cork> i think that is the contextmenu event actually
[07:17:02] <Cork> else it isn't a standard event
[07:17:12] <hellyeah> is it jquery?
[07:17:18] <Cork> no
[07:17:25] <Cork> dom standard or fully custom
[07:17:25] <hellyeah> javascript then
[07:17:44] <Cork> hellyeah: jquery only fake a very small set of events
[07:17:53] <Cork> (think it is like 3-4)
[07:17:53] <hellyeah> oh
[07:17:59] <Cork> the rest are just dom standard events
[07:18:12] <Cork> jquery ui produces a lot more though
[07:18:15] <hellyeah> so jqyert has 3-4 custom events
[07:18:30] <hellyeah> jquery i see
[07:18:32] <Cork> hover, mouseenter, mouseleave...
[07:18:43] <hellyeah> hm
[07:19:10] <hellyeah> understand
[07:19:20] <hellyeah> what do ypu suggest? using contextmenu
[07:19:51] <Cork> i can't say to be honest
[07:19:56] <Cork> i've never needed to do it
[07:20:25] <Cork> but i wouldn't be supriced if it is just touch and a timer
[07:21:25] <hellyeah> could be that too
[08:01:50] <hellyeah> hey,
[08:01:57] <hellyeah> what is my mistake here? http://jsfiddle.net/587n9/232/
[08:03:21] <hellyeah> hm
[08:04:01] <dimi1947> take a look at this fiddle:https://jsfiddle.net/fiddlehunt/b5oyy80g/  there are 2 divs named wrapper_servp..one is hidden...how can I target the data's attribute value of the input element with class="services text" of the hidden div...in other words I want to target 26
[08:08:00] <hellyeah> okey
[08:08:08] <hellyeah> you have two elements with same class right
[08:08:23] <hellyeah> you can loop it and check is hidden or not
[08:13:13] <Cork> dimi1947: https://jsfiddle.net/b5oyy80g/1/
[08:15:00] <dimi1947> Cork:OK it works,thanks..but I do not understand how it works...how the hidden div is targeted
[08:15:21] <Cork> it targets the data-service attribute
[08:17:17] <dimi1947> cork:now I noticed that in your fiddle there is only one div...it easy to target that since there is only one div in the DOM...what will happen if you have also another div visible
[08:21:20] <hellyeah> dimi1947:  if you have multiple elements with same class you should loop through it
[08:21:26] <Cork> no
[08:21:32] <hellyeah> hm
[08:21:36] <Cork> dimi1947: can you reproduce the problem you're trying to solve?
[08:21:59] <Cork> (where the state of the match what you want to include and exclude)
[08:22:37] <dimi1947> Cork:what you mean reproduce? I have given the link of a fiddle...
[08:22:57] <Cork> dimi1947: ya, but as you just stated it doesn't match what you are actually working with
[08:23:19] <Cork> and i just requested that you correct that so it becomes representative of the problem
[08:23:44] <dimi1947> Cork:what you want me to correct exactly...
[08:23:57] <dimi1947> Cork:be specific
[08:24:20] <Cork> dimi1947: correct the fiddle so the code provided doesn't work cause of how the real situation actually look like
[08:24:40] <dimi1947> Cork:ok give me a second
[08:27:38] <dimi1947> Cork: https://jsfiddle.net/b5oyy80g/   2 div elements...one hidden,one visible...target the data attribute of the input with class="service"...of the HIDDEN
[08:28:56] <Cork> there is only one element there
[08:29:11] <Cork> $('.services').length == 1
[08:59:59] <dimi1947> https://jsfiddle.net/b5oyy80g/
[09:00:26] <dimi1947> https://jsfiddle.net/fiddlehunt/b5oyy80g/
[09:00:39] <dimi1947> this last one is the correct
[09:33:00] <rgr_> this is really week and google has failed me. I have a jquery objct pointing to a container. that container includes a form. can I select that form without using a class or ID selector?
[09:34:15] <rgr_> e.find("form") should work, right?
[09:36:44] <Cork> yes
[09:49:11] <dimi1947> Cork:have you seen my fiddle?
[10:20:46] <toothfai_> $.map($('input[name="skills"]:checked'), function(c){return c.value; })    How do I escape when desiring to return: return <p>c.value</p>; ?
[10:23:22] <Cork> toothfai_: why do you want html in the value array?
[10:24:19] <toothfai_> Cork: I later do   document.getElementById("skills").innerHTML = array; and would like each skill to be outputted on a separate line
[10:25:20] <Cork> toothfai_: then i would recommend doing $('#skill').html($.map($('input[name="skills"]:checked'), function(c){return $('<p>', text: c.value })[0]; }))
[10:25:44] <Cork> that way you don't have to parse it as html (and there by don't risk xss)
[10:25:55] <toothfai_> tnx Cork! Will try this
[10:28:08] <rjCousineau> Hello
[10:32:22] <rjCousineau> is it possible to save .html() inside data attribute?
[10:32:48] <Cork> sure
[10:39:20] <rjCousineau> This is difficult to explain.  I'm trying to replace html with built jQuery elements.  Then on checking a checkbox, replace that html with different jquery element (while preserving user input in input fields) and switch back and forth when checkboxes are checked.  https://jsfiddle.net/49r60dt2/
[10:40:26] <rjCousineau> I might have solved it....
[10:41:02] <Cork> rjCousineau: you prob don't want to replace the html, cause then the input that was there gets lost
[10:41:16] <rjCousineau> yes I just found the input gets lost.
[10:41:19] <Cork> instead i would recommend just showing and hiding fields
[10:41:23] <rjCousineau> good idea. ty
[10:42:03] <Cork> then you can remove the fields you don't care about before submit or something like that if you need to (or just set them to .hide().prop('disabled', true)
[10:53:28] <rjCousineau> Cork: worked, thanks!
[11:08:45] <toothfai_> Cork: forget to include it was an array, https://dpaste.de/4YL5  now confused on how to implement what you suggested
[11:09:24] <Cork> toothfai_: the line i gave you replaces line 4 to 6
[11:10:36] <Cork> toothfai_: https://jsfiddle.net/gb1zopez/
[11:12:11] <toothfai_> Cork: strange, for some reason it gives no output while the old code (without the <p>) do.
[11:16:29] <rjCousineau> Does anyone know if .data() will attach to all matching elements?
[11:16:39] <rjCousineau> $('*').data('something', true)
[11:17:17] <Cork> toothfai_: https://jsfiddle.net/gb1zopez/1/
[11:17:44] <Cork> rjCousineau: data is just a ref inside jquery it doesn't attach
[11:18:24] <Cork> but yes that will populate the object with the value and a ref to all elements in the page that existed at that specific time (i would recommend against it though, as it will baloon your memory usage)
[11:18:36] <toothfai_> Cork: wonderful, that worked, tnx!
[11:19:11] <Cork> toothfai_: just fixed a couple of typos and it worked

[12:38:26] <SideFX> Is there a  location I can see demos of all the themes on jquery UI?
[15:53:50] <poboy> hey, I want to wrap this in an if statement,  if ($('.cityZip'.val() != ""))  but that's not the right syntax.  Any help? https://kopy.io/tMmP6
[15:54:21] <poboy> there are cases where that class has a value of "" and in that case I don't want to set those other values
[15:54:33] <taplar> you're missing a ')' after the selector
[16:04:26] <codezera> Edit: if ($('.cityZip').val() != "")
[16:04:50] <codezera> .cityZip will probably return more items. Better use id.
[16:08:20] <taplar> unless it's the only one with that class
[16:09:43] <codezera> yes but still it is a bad practice uno
[16:09:51] <taplar> i disagree
[16:10:17] <codezera> why?
[16:10:43] <taplar> i disagree with the stance that if something is only going to appear once, it -must- use an id rather than a class
[16:10:55] <taplar> it's not necessary
[16:11:51] <codezera> Yes but every page could have elements with the same class.
[16:12:09] <taplar> 'could'
[16:12:53] <codezera> :)
[16:12:53] <taplar> i'd rather be familiar with the application and 'know'
[16:17:34] <taplar> though i could have also formed my opinion based on the number of times people misuse ids and it bites them in the azz
[16:19:11] <grapheti> with css modules that's hardly likely
[16:19:13] <grapheti> :D
[16:21:13] <grapheti> I hardly ever used IDs. I may use them for layout.
[16:21:25] <grapheti> use*
[16:25:12] <codezera> i too don't use IDs except for tables and layout wrappers
[16:26:17] <grapheti> sweet sweet
[17:26:00] <V7> Could someone help me with https://jsfiddle.net/o0j1bfrz/3/ ?
[17:26:45] <V7> As you can see + buttons are visible even if all columns are visible and table's width is wide enough to show them
[17:28:15] <V7> How to hide them if table is wide enought ?
[17:28:21] <V7> enough *
[17:29:53] <taplar> conceptually you'd need to be able to tell if all columns are visible or not, for starters
[17:31:09] <V7> taplar: Responsive plugin adds "display: none;" to each table from end if table isn't wide enough
[17:31:40] <V7> So td:hidden:first ?
[17:31:57] <V7> In specified chld row
[17:32:04] <taplar> so then you'd check if any of the header td are hidden
[17:33:39] <V7> So then $( "#" + table_id + "thead tr td:hidden:first" ) ?
[17:34:14] <taplar> you don't really need the :first, but try it
[17:34:57] <V7> Roger btw thank you taplar :)
[17:45:40] <taplar> something like this maybe: https://jsfiddle.net/o0j1bfrz/4/
[19:24:25] <V7> Thank you Tadas
[19:24:41] <V7> oh Tadas sorry misscalled
[19:25:38] <V7> Btw is it possible to get columns slection which are hidden in respnsive view via DataTables Api >
[19:25:40] <V7> ?
[21:14:03] <ideayep> var TOM=new Array("1", "2", "3"); what happened when I call $("#TOM").val()
[21:17:11] <ideayep> anyone here
[21:48:48] <SideFX> I have a .js file I'm running jquery in, and it doesn't work when called via <script src="primary.js"></script>
[21:49:06] <SideFX> But if I paste it in the .html file nested in <script></script> it works
[21:49:27] <SideFX> Does anyone know why it would be any different?
[21:49:50] <SideFX> Oh I just moved it to the bottom of the html and it works now
[22:16:13] <randymarsh9> hey guys
[22:17:14] <randymarsh9> can someone tell me why my addClass method isn't working?
[22:17:43] <randymarsh9> https://jsfiddle.net/uq7ktL56/3/
[22:19:57] <randymarsh9> This one might be easier to read
[22:19:59] <randymarsh9> https://jsfiddle.net/uq7ktL56/4/
[22:30:06] <shoky> randymarsh9: it is working. your css just needs to be more specific, if you have a default "display" for it
[22:30:48] <shoky> (quick fix: change .hide { ... }   to  #input-field.hide { ... } )
[22:31:21] <randymarsh9> shoky: you're right, if i add another property to that class it shows, so the class is being applied
[22:31:36] <randymarsh9> wondering how come the display:none is not hiding it though
[22:31:54] <shoky> randymarsh9: you can inspect elements in your browsers devtools to see eaxctly what classes they have
[22:32:28] <shoky> randymarsh9: because the css selector .hide  for it is not specific enough. it gets overridden by the #input-field { display: ... }
[22:32:47] <shoky> read about css specificity if you want more details
[22:33:00] <randymarsh9> shoky: dang
[22:33:06] <randymarsh9> that's it
[22:33:14] <randymarsh9> stupid display inline is messing it up
[22:33:17] <shoky> but basically  #input-field is a more specific selector than  .hide
[22:33:24] <randymarsh9> i thought display:none > all
[22:33:30] <shoky> that's not the selector
[22:33:38] <shoky> the selector is .hide  or #input-field
[22:33:42] <shoky> only those matter
[22:33:57] <shoky> for the specificity stuff
[22:34:31] <shoky> and no, display:none isn't > anything ;p
[22:34:41] <shoky> it's just one possible value of the "display" property
[22:37:49] <randymarsh9> ok starting to make a little more sense
[22:38:13] <randymarsh9> ty shoky
[22:40:31] <randymarsh9> doing #input-field.hide fixed it, udaman
