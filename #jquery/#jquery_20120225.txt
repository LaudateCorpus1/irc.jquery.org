[00:00:06] <pcfreak30> gitta love js's dynamic/lazy nature
[00:00:53] <here4thegear> predikt: can I just do var geoData = $.get(url);?
[00:01:26] <pcfreak30> diverdude: in that case, inside the $(fuction(, may another variable to copy k, to keep in scope
[00:01:47] <predikt> here4thegear: actually, i think you have to pass in a parameter that you are trying to use json, so something like this $.get(url, function() { //define it }, 'json');
[00:01:53] <predikt> here4thegear: try that
[00:02:07] <pcfreak30> diverdude: http://jsfiddle.net/652fC/1/
[00:02:10] <diverdude> pcfreak30: huh? why would i want to make another variable?
[00:02:11] * SirDerpsAlot sighs
[00:02:15] <SirDerpsAlot> this is still not working
[00:02:24] <predikt> here4thegear: sample of that parameter at bottom of docs here: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.get/
[00:02:36] <pcfreak30> hmm from what i see it should
[00:02:40] <predikt> near support and contributions, tell me if it works
[00:02:56] <diverdude> pcfreak30: that does not change a thing
[00:03:01] <SirDerpsAlot> full source: http://pastebin.com/SmbC80CC
[00:03:04] <here4thegear> predikt: thanks!
[00:03:09] <SirDerpsAlot> ccv doesn't seem to be working at all
[00:03:14] <predikt> here4thegear: very welcome :)
[00:03:20] <pcfreak30> diverdude: b/c it seems your using so many dunctions, k is getting lost somehow so to keep a reference inside the function you need to copy it down to keep access to it
[00:03:36] <diverdude> pcfreak30: nono has nothing to do with that
[00:07:51] <SirDerpsAlot> meh
[00:07:55] <SirDerpsAlot> not worth the bother.
[00:08:30] <pcfreak30> SirDerpsAlot: $('#card_number').newccv($.ccv.ccv[validationType]);
[00:08:39] <SirDerpsAlot> hm
[00:08:40] <pcfreak30> sry was using the wrong propery
[00:08:45] <SirDerpsAlot> hadn't tried that
[00:08:49] <pcfreak30> i know
[00:08:59] <pcfreak30> its what i was referring to but i got confused
[00:09:11] <pcfreak30> it seems objevts can be treated/accessed like arrays
[00:09:40] <pcfreak30> so var data = {a: 1, b: 1};
[00:09:50] <pcfreak30> data["a"] returns 1
[00:09:52] <pcfreak30> :)
[00:09:54] <youngin> angela: still there
[00:09:58] <SirDerpsAlot> hmmm
[00:10:09] <SirDerpsAlot> I'm wondering if it's not something that's changed in the mask plugin
[00:10:18] <angela> yeah, wats up youngin
[00:10:18] <SirDerpsAlot> that's newer than their example
[00:10:57] <pcfreak30> im just going by what i see
[00:11:01] <youngin> angela: my name is aaron
[00:11:15] <youngin> angela: i just wanted to show you the classic 1975 movie Aaron Loves Angela: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XIlcO7NvXM
[00:11:17] <pcfreak30> if you access $.ccv as an array, u can have it return the correct value
[00:11:35] <angela> ha, sorry, still at work...
[00:11:38] <pcfreak30> no need for a switch tho u can choose that route
[00:12:17] <youngin> cool, talk to you later
[00:12:26] <pcfreak30> lol less than a month and i feel like a js expert (not saying i am)
[00:13:12] <youngin> actually that trailer sucks but its a nice movie
[00:13:33] <SirDerpsAlot> any time ccv runs, mask breaks
[00:14:01] <SirDerpsAlot> however...
[00:14:05] <SirDerpsAlot> hoohooohoo
[00:14:12] <pcfreak30> wy not alter and fix it.
[00:14:16] <SirDerpsAlot> it's so simple it's stupid
[00:14:21] <pcfreak30> shouldnt be that hard
[00:14:36] <SirDerpsAlot> I'm just gonna jack ccv's definitions and pass that to mask
[00:16:46] <SirDerpsAlot> that works well enough
[00:18:44] <SirDerpsAlot> perfect.
[00:19:18] <SirDerpsAlot> jacked the definitions, then set the onchange to just call mask and pass it the value of the key passed in
[00:19:31] <SirDerpsAlot> then just had it focus on the field after mask was set
[00:38:50] <mehrdad> is it possible to bind a function to an event whose object  is not an 'element' ?
[00:48:39] <Marto> Guys I am looking for Jquery source to learn more advanced stuff. I found book learning jquery but thats for verion 1.3
[01:10:42] <diverdude> How do $.inArray() compare objects?
[01:10:54] <diverdude> if i e.g. want to compare complex objects
[01:25:35] <KQuery> Marto- experience.
[01:26:15] <KQuery> just suffer the nuances and reach for the big picture and realize soon - we'll reach KQuery - atomicity.
[01:26:31] <KQuery> until then - it's 1.3 to 1.4 to  ? I guess 1.5
[01:26:41] <KQuery> something bigger on the horizon
[01:26:51] <KQuery> TRANSCENDING to Jquery
[01:27:05] <KQuery> after all - all we ever wanted was snap in GUI functionality -
[01:27:09] <diverdude> KQuery: how do i finde the index of some object in an array?
[01:27:29] <KQuery> but further - this is mere 'presentation' and elegance in exploiting / harnessing
[01:27:30] <KQuery> DOM
[01:27:42] <KQuery> come a day where we will be free from DOM
[01:27:46] <KQuery> I welcome that day
[01:27:53] <KQuery> but ALL will be transparent -
[01:28:30] <KQuery> JQuery was welcomed by me - however I'm awaiting something more atomic.
[01:28:51] <KQuery> and you just KNOW LQuery is next post K !
[01:30:08] <KQuery> actually- it's all about 'reacting' to DOM - as we have it - Javascript works - for now.  In the end - computer science students will find themselves in advanced mathematics programs if they have any hope at all.
[01:31:13] <KQuery> MIT will end up just fast tracking people to DoD and money making corporate machines - REAL creative people use MIT's Courseware !  as I do - for free! lol screw the credit system.
[01:31:23] <KQuery> I
[01:31:38] <cesaro> hey! this might be a weird question but ill give it a whirl. I've got a sql database outputting into datatables, which is working out great so far. but one of the columns i would like to expand into a larger text area when you select it, as i cant find the information required in the traditional table
[01:31:46] <cesaro> could anyone give me a push in the right direction for doing this?
[01:31:55] <KQuery>  love MIT's intro to comp. sci lectures - the video series - 'computer science' on day one is revealed to have NOTHING TO DO with 'computers' or 'science'
[01:32:30] <KQuery> reminds me of my 1954 books from Her Majesty on 'automation of thought processae' lol
[01:32:50] <KQuery> techno roots from greek to mean 'skill'
[01:33:11] <KQuery> after all- what is 'technology' - and logos is rooted to mean 'knowledge'
[01:33:14] <KQuery> skill + knowledge -
[01:33:16] <KQuery> Jquery
[01:33:19] <KQuery> ? ?
[01:33:28] <KQuery> snappy GUI functionality period.
[01:33:38] <KQuery> XNLHTTP is one thing
[01:33:50] <KQuery> and mind you - I DO love the Jquery tabs -
[01:33:54] <KQuery> I use them often
[01:34:06] <KQuery> er, WRAPPING UP in single line calls -
[01:34:15] <KQuery> it's all good
[01:34:57] <KQuery> can't help you
[01:34:57] <KQuery> ut one of the columns i would like to expand into a larger text area when you select it, as i cant find the information required in the traditional table
[01:35:06] <diverdude> KQuery: how do i finde the index of some object in an array?
[01:35:14] <KQuery> "but one of the columns i would like to expand into a larger text area when you select it, as i cant find the information required in the traditional table"
[01:35:25] <KQuery> I don't get that
[01:35:48] <KQuery> [04:31] <cesaro> hey! this might be a weird question but ill give it a whirl. I've got a sql database outputting into datatables, which is working out great so far. but one of the columns i would like to expand into a larger text area when you select it, as i cant find the information required in the traditional table
[01:35:56] <KQuery> there is something missing in that post
[01:35:58] <KQuery> AND ?
[01:35:59] <KQuery> AS ?
[01:36:03] <KQuery> WHAT THE GOD DAMN ?
[01:36:05] <KQuery> AS WHAT ?
[01:36:21] <diverdude> KQuery: stop blabbering and answer my question ;)
[01:36:26] <KQuery> AS you can't find the information required ? ;
[01:36:30] <sahana> hi all, i have implemented jquery fancybox.     but last image is appearing first. any guesses?
[01:36:32] <KQuery> I'd help but
[01:36:42] <KQuery> I didn't get the final conundrum
[01:36:48] <KQuery> er, dilemma
[01:36:52] <KQuery> AS X -  what about Y ?
[01:36:58] <diverdude> sahana: invert display ?
[01:37:10] <KQuery> you never said - what the final problem was.
[01:37:26] <KQuery> and 'traditional' table
[01:37:30] <KQuery> left me puzzled.
[01:37:48] <KQuery> I didn't get 'traditional' SIGMA references in academia -
[01:37:58] <KQuery> all is good
[01:38:05] <KQuery> but - just didn't understand your problem - that's all
[01:38:08] <KQuery> all respect
[01:38:27] <KQuery> I'm equally at fault on 'terminology'
[01:38:29] <KQuery> at times
[01:38:35] <KQuery> I do love set theory though
[01:38:45] <KQuery> Georg Cantor ended up in a lunatic asylum
[01:38:48] <mehrdad> anyone ? http://pastebin.com/tdDBCgja
[01:38:51] <KQuery> THE man who brougt us SQL
[01:38:55] <sahana> demo: http://www.ifpindia.org/jain/jainnew/data/gallerytest.html  click "Rock shelters" hyperlink in the program.
[01:38:57] <sahana> Last image is appearing first (ie in reverse order).
[01:38:57] <KQuery> go figure
[01:39:48] <mehrdad> KQuery, go on
[01:41:00] <mehrdad> why is bind function undefined? http://pastebin.com/tdDBCgja
[01:41:50] <iman> mehrdad, yo know bud, it's none of our business
[01:42:00] <iman> mehrdad, try it out yourself
[01:43:37] <sahana> any idea, why it isppearing so? this problem only in firefox
[01:43:45] <BinaryKitten> iman  maybe because
[01:44:01] <BinaryKitten> mehrdad maybe because this is not jquery?
[01:44:09] <BinaryKitten> or a jquery object?
[01:44:26] <BinaryKitten> ps, i really reallu dislike the code style
[01:45:43] <mehrdad> BinaryKitten, it has extended the widget which is jquery object no?
[01:46:06] <BinaryKitten> don't ask me, check
[01:46:12] <BinaryKitten> console.log(this);
[01:46:15] <BinaryKitten> see what you get out
[01:46:36] <mehrdad> ok, but i am certain
[01:46:47] <BinaryKitten> in the end, with only a subsection of the code, I can't tell so I'm guessing
[01:47:00] <mehrdad> alright, i'm going to log it
[01:47:23] <cesaro> can you attach a jquery popup event to the 'selected' state of a single column in a table.
[01:47:36] <BinaryKitten> popup event?
[01:48:17] <cesaro> i want something to popup and happen! like a magic materialising text area or something
[01:48:43] <BinaryKitten> tables don't have a "selected" event
[01:49:01] <BinaryKitten> so, the answer would be no (but there might be other ways)
[01:49:08] <BinaryKitten> define selected?
[01:49:17] <cesaro> i am drawing it with datatables, which can select and respond a certain way when you `click` into one of the table cells
[01:49:33] <iman> mehrdad, please log it if it ain't broke
[01:50:37] <BinaryKitten> cesaro: you can hook the click event. but not all browsers support it within table cells
[01:50:53] <sahbeewah> hi, i have this "edit product" type of page where it contains a form with inputs prepopulated via php. upon form submission, i want the form only to submit inputs which have been changed from their original values. is there a standard way of doing this?
[01:51:14] <BinaryKitten> my advice would be to use .on in delegate mode and capture the event's target
[01:51:41] <BinaryKitten> sahbeewah yes
[01:52:01] <BinaryKitten> in php make sure you add data-origValue="value" to the fields
[01:52:24] <BinaryKitten> where "value" is the original value (php echo etc)
[01:53:28] * KQuery retreats into managing multicast delegates in multiple sessions with no sanity in sight.
[01:53:57] <BinaryKitten> $('#formId').submit(function(){ $inputs = $(this).find(':input'); $inputs.each(fn() { blah check .val with .data('origValue'); }))
[01:54:11] <BinaryKitten> rough pseudocode for you sahbeewah
[01:54:32] <KQuery> nice work BK
[01:54:32] <sahbeewah> right
[01:54:36] <sahbeewah> but
[01:54:49] <sahbeewah> then i inject a new form into the dom, with the associated inputs and submit that?
[01:55:50] <KQuery> it pains me to see where we are in expressing what we want to express 'reacting' to DOM. I can't wait for a freedom from DOM. Might be 3 years out - 5 ? who knows.
[01:56:12] <KQuery> seems an awful lot of intellectual effort is wasted on yesterdays mistakes.
[01:56:47] <BinaryKitten> if you're injecting a new form, then you have an object for that form
[01:56:49] <KQuery> let's all go kidnap Douglas Crockford - and fill him full of those brown topped mushrooms - and have him come out with a new model !
[01:57:08] <BinaryKitten> lol KQuery
[01:57:15] <KQuery> ok- I'd settle for a camp fire session with Douglas.
[01:57:18] <BinaryKitten> KQuery if only he created it..
[01:57:31] <KQuery> well he'd have some insights -
[01:57:34] <BinaryKitten> sahbeewah at that point, before injection, specify and bind the submit
[01:57:51] <BinaryKitten> KQuery he has, he will, and he has them on his blog and YUITheatre
[01:58:03] <KQuery> NK - if you don't mind me asking - what are you doing for work right now ?
[01:58:07] <sahbeewah> right
[01:58:19] <sahbeewah> so is creating a form on the submit handler pretty standard?
[01:58:20] <BinaryKitten> KQuery I'm work for an agency.. why
[01:58:22] <KQuery> I'm impressed !
[01:58:27] <sahbeewah> it kinda feels bad
[01:58:28] <KQuery> just curious.
[01:58:50] <BinaryKitten> what about yourself KQuery what are you doing for work right now?
[01:59:15] <BinaryKitten> because, right now, I'm doing nothing for work. It's a Saturday
[01:59:21] <KQuery> the knowledge you reflect BK - demonstrates a potential,
[01:59:26] <KQuery> oh, is it ?
[01:59:34] <BinaryKitten> 09:59am Saturday
[01:59:37] <KQuery> I don't keep track of the days anymore - not that the two day model does me well.
[01:59:46] <KQuery> it's always tomorrow in Japan from where I live.
[01:59:59] <KQuery> but - really though - age ? 43 here.
[02:00:14] * BinaryKitten is not doing ASL
[02:00:17] <KQuery> that was a fast snappy response there.
[02:00:22] <KQuery> didn't ask S
[02:00:31] <KQuery> just aggregate count of revolutions around the sun
[02:00:35] <KQuery> how personal is that ?
[02:00:40] <sahbeewah> the idea is i don't want to submit values which haven't been modified, and attaching data to those inputs doesn't really do anything apart from making the comparison easier
[02:00:42] <KQuery> how many revolutions have you made around the sun BK ?
[02:00:49] <BinaryKitten> quite personal actually
[02:00:54] <KQuery> ok - fair enough
[02:01:07] <KQuery> well - big comet or meteor hitting someday
[02:01:17] <KQuery> I guess I was out of bounds. I hear you though.
[02:01:21] <BinaryKitten> Enough not to be at college, but not enough for retirement
[02:01:32] <KQuery> was JUST wondering -
[02:02:10] <KQuery> oh - I'm done with retirement - programming 30 years - all paradigms - at 43 ? I don't have to work any more - in fact - I don't -
[02:02:14] <elfrancesco_> hello here... i am wondering what are thoses jquery1234832749 attributes i can find in some webpage's tags... are they stored data for some jquery plugin ?
[02:02:18] <KQuery> alas why I didn't even know what day it was.
[02:02:30] <BinaryKitten> anyway.. sahbeewah  stop trying to break the web, use the PHP to filter
[02:02:35] <KQuery> I planned to retire by 55 - came early - lol
[02:02:44] <BinaryKitten> once it hits the php layer, it's really simple to ignore the data
[02:02:54] <sahbeewah> ok
[02:03:00] <sahbeewah> that seems logical
[02:03:09] <sahbeewah> btw on the topic of binary
[02:03:09] <KQuery> er, PHP eh - you know - some people I hang out with would say - PHP ? augh ! jk  -
[02:03:10] <sahbeewah> while we're at it
[02:03:13] <BinaryKitten> plus it won't drive you insane when the user isn't using javascript
[02:03:17] <KQuery> that NODE.JS guy - what's his name now - lol
[02:03:20] <iman> Blah Blah
[02:03:28] <sahbeewah> is there any practical uses for bitwise operators nowadays
[02:03:34] <sahbeewah> are*
[02:03:38] <KQuery> I'm poking them in #smartos lately.
[02:03:59] <BinaryKitten> KQuery please, if you're not adding something to this , try not typing.. We would all appreciate it
[02:04:03] <KQuery> I am most interested - but I still want a consumer based solution - thin - will be some time to come.
[02:04:13] <KQuery> BK - agreed- I go now
[02:04:17] <BinaryKitten> sahbeewah  yep  config options
[02:04:33] <BinaryKitten> sorry guys if I was a bit rude there
[02:05:13] <sahbeewah> okay i'll read up on that
[02:05:14] <sahbeewah> thanks bro
[02:05:17] <rue> It's broadly speaking always better to use proper objects, even for config options and so on
[02:05:18] <mehrdad> what drug does he use? i want that, really
[02:05:18] <BinaryKitten> sahbeewah I would for 1 data field with various flag type options
[02:05:27] <BinaryKitten> sahbeewah, I'm no bro
[02:06:05] <rue> But there are cases where you need to interface with something lower, and cases where you *really* need to save every byte you can
[02:06:34] <BinaryKitten> Rue true too
[02:06:58] * BinaryKitten remembers sending data to a RFID data terminal via VB6 .. that was painful
[02:07:05] <rue> If you're using jQuery, it's a safe assumption neither is probably true ;)
[02:07:22] <BinaryKitten> rue i wouldn't say so
[02:07:40] <rue> I exaggerate a little
[02:08:01] <BinaryKitten> the smaller the data packet, and the simpler the data processing, the more responsive you can make it.
[02:08:10] <BinaryKitten> Plus, my mobile will love your site
[02:08:28] <elfrancesco_> what does the javascript assert function do please ? does it execute an instruction into a sort of protected (of what?) context ?
[02:08:29] <rue> Heh, that's true… but I'd primarily look elsewhere for optimizations
[02:09:06] <BinaryKitten> ?mdc assert @ elfrancesco_
[02:09:14] <bot-t> elfrancesco_, Mozmill Controller Object - MDN - https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Mozmill/Mozmill_Controller_Object
[02:09:15] <BinaryKitten> bot-t wake up
[02:09:25] <elfrancesco_> a bit slow ;)
[02:09:28] <elfrancesco_> thanks BinaryKitten
[02:09:49] <BinaryKitten> elfrancesco_ in most cases, those kind of questions will just get us googling
[02:10:50] <rue> sahbeewah: If you're asking whether it's worth learning them, sure. Especially & and |, those would be the ones you'd usually use.
[02:10:53] <elfrancesco_> sorry
[02:12:24] <mehrdad> i really hate what has been put on me to do
[02:12:29] <BinaryKitten> elfrancesco_ no worries, just saving you from getting a RTFM later on
[02:12:34] <mehrdad> it is a jungle of different js libs
[02:13:14] <mehrdad> it seems the object i was referring to with this is not actually jquery, only uses it for other stuff
[02:13:44] * BinaryKitten shakes mehrdad's hand
[02:13:55] <BinaryKitten> at least you know now
[02:14:02] <mehrdad> yes :)
[02:14:25] <mehrdad> but i have to know how to bind the events as well :/
[02:14:27] <BinaryKitten> remember if something is Hinky, test your expectations, then test the results, then test everything else
[02:14:51] <mehrdad> one end is jquery based , the other is not it seems
[02:14:55] <BinaryKitten> mehrdad well If you can get a dom element, then pass that directly to jQuery
[02:15:22] <BinaryKitten> don't use $ use jQuery instead
[02:15:43] <mehrdad> the event's parent object is not a dom element
[02:16:25] <BinaryKitten> at this point, i need to leave. sorry mehrdad  i can't help further
[02:16:43] <mehrdad> u were nice enough to respond
[02:16:49] <mehrdad> thx and bye
[02:23:22] <fotoflo> hmm, I've got a list['myKey'] = "123" , and I'm iterating through the list with $.each(list, function( i ) {   console.log(this, i ) ;  });   how do i find out which 'myKey' I'm on?
[02:23:47] <sahbeewah> each(list, function(key, value) {
[02:24:01] <fotoflo> sahbeewah: then how do i get that i?
[02:24:08] <fotoflo> put it outside the closure?
[02:24:35] <sahbeewah> what does i refer to
[02:24:40] <sahbeewah> the value right?
[02:26:10] <fotoflo> i = 0;  $.each(list, function( key, value ) {  console.log(this, key, value, i ) ; i++;  });
[02:26:12] <fotoflo> should work
[02:26:31] <fotoflo> thats what i mean
[02:34:17] <dilvie> what are you using i for?
[02:36:07] <dilvie> maybe pick a different name for i? "key" generally takes the place of the index in .each loops.. in other words, because you're using .each (which handles the collection enumeration internally), you don't need to keep track of i yourself.
[02:37:27] <pixolin> hello. for hiding/revealing a paragraph I use click(function() {$(this).slideToggle(500);}; but I want to exclude images in the paragraph from this click function. how would I do this?
[02:43:16] <sahbeewah> pixolin: put an event handler on the image and use e.stopPropagation()
[02:43:49] <pixolin> ah, thanks. I was just trying to add a .not(img) -- would that work?
[02:45:14] <sahbeewah> where would you add that to
[02:46:14] <pixolin> I hope it's OK if I paste one line of code here:
[02:46:19] <pixolin> $('.clickable').not('.clickable img').click(function() { $(this).slideToggle(500); });
[02:47:13] <sahbeewah> that doesn't seem like it'll work
[02:47:14] <sahbeewah> does it?
[02:47:28] <pixolin> nah
[02:47:49] <sahbeewah> because the handler is on the clickable
[02:48:19] <sahbeewah> so even if it doesn't match the img
[02:48:35] <sahbeewah> it bubbles up to the next item until it reaches a click handler
[02:49:01] <pixolin> so, this wouldn't work either:
[02:49:05] <pixolin> $('.clickable').click(function() { $(this, not('.clickable img')).slideToggle(500); });
[02:49:08] <dilvie> if you resolve() a Deferred that was already reject()'ed, is that resolve() ignored?
[02:49:12] <pixolin> (not even sure about the syntax)
[02:49:38] <dilvie> try it and see, dilvie
[02:49:52] * dilvie talks to himself, yes.
[02:50:07] <pixolin> :)
[02:57:11] <sahbeewah> one way you could do it, not sure if it's any more efficient is something like $(".clickable").on("click", ":not(img)", function() { ... });
[02:57:31] <pixolin> great, thank you sahbeewah, will try that
[02:58:20] <jtoy> with the jquery ajax calls, can i have them wait before retrying ? i don't see how to do it
[03:05:34] <diverdude> is $('<div></div>') the same as $($('<div></div>')) and $($($('<div></div>'))) etc ?
[03:09:28] <dilvie> so, the answer is that subsequent resolves are, in fact, ignored. hurray
[03:09:32] <dilvie> http://jsfiddle.net/dilvie/Vk7ex/
[03:21:27] <mehrdad> any other lib besides jquery uses the extend syntax?
[03:25:13] <dilvie> underscore does
[03:37:12] <amitprakash> Hi.. in a $.ajax functions success callback.. if a value is returned then is does $.ajax return the same ? i.e. val = $.ajax({success: function(data){ return 99; }); then does val = 99? if not.. then who is the success function returning to?
[03:39:52] <dilvie> amit: no.. val is not what you expect.
[03:39:58] <dilvie> val is going to hold a promise.
[03:40:10] <amitprakash> ...
[03:40:45] <dilvie> ajax is asynchronous... it's not going to pause there at that point in the code and wait for the value to come back.
[03:41:33] <dilvie> Instead, it returns a promise. On a promise, you can set a ,done() callback that will be fired when the promise is resolved.
[03:42:42] <amitprakash> theres an actual term called promise!! :S
[03:43:03] <dilvie> You can skip the succes thing and just do: $.ajax(params).done(function (data) { myNextFunction(); };
[03:43:17] <dilvie> yeah.
[03:54:08] <pflock> how can I draw lines?
[03:55:49] <diverdude> shouldn't it be possible to do: http://jsfiddle.net/652fC/3/ ?
[03:57:37] <quuxman> hmmm, what's going on here? When I run: var resp; $.ajax({ url : '/', success : function(r) { resp = r } }) // resp is of type Document in Firefox, but in Chrome it's a string
[03:58:09] <quuxman> obviously this completely breaks things in Firefox
[04:01:52] <quuxman> ah, I need dataType: 'text' in there. I wonder why the dauflt's different on Chrome
[04:04:19] <xyz> somebody an idea why this doesnt work?
[04:04:21] <xyz> $('#serverselect_S2').hover(function () {
[04:04:21] <xyz>    $('#data').load('serverinfo.php?serv_id=S2')
[04:04:21] <xyz> },
[04:04:21] <xyz> function () {
[04:04:21] <xyz>    $('#data').load('serverinfo.php?serv_id=S2')
[04:04:21] <xyz> });
[04:04:50] <xyz> I want to fill a div with a web page when another div gets hovered over
[04:05:09] <fof> youre missing some semi-colons at least
[04:06:53] <xyz> hmm is it that.. (lol) .. let me see
[04:08:05] <fof> how come you do the same thing with handlerIn & handlerOut
[04:08:56] <xyz> I dont now.. not sure if both should be specified or not
[04:09:21] <xyz> but with semicolons it still doesnt work
[04:09:26] <xyz> $('#serverselect_S2').hover(function () {
[04:09:26] <xyz>    $('#data').load('serverinfo.php?serv_id=S2');
[04:09:26] <xyz> },
[04:09:26] <xyz> function () {
[04:09:26] <xyz>    $('#data').load('serverinfo.php?serv_id=S2');
[04:09:26] <xyz> });
[04:09:42] <pflock> is there a way to draw lines with Jquery or html or something?
[04:10:08] <dabear> ?p @ xyz
[04:10:08] <bot-t> xyz, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[04:11:03] <fof> there is a single handler constructor
[04:11:14] <fof> which will execute when entering and leaving
[04:11:52] <fof> but honestly cant help, syntax looks fine
[04:12:28] <xyz> Your JS code is valid.
[04:16:54] <diverdude> Why is nothing inserted in k in this small example: http://jsfiddle.net/652fC/7/ ?
[04:19:06] <muzone> At http://jsfiddle.net/dwaynie/XVqVD/ - is there a way to make #main-menu's dropdowns work despite #header's overflow: hidden? I tried setting #main-menu to overflow: visible; but that didn't do the trick.
[04:19:21] <pflock> can I somehow draw lines?
[04:19:42] <fof> diverdude: http://jsfiddle.net/652fC/8/
[04:20:15] <dabear> diverdude: http://jsfiddle.net/652fC/9/
[04:20:18] <dabear> bah
[04:21:02] <dabear> basically, k = k.add(...)
[04:21:59] <fof> yeah, like http://jsfiddle.net/652fC/10/
[04:23:15] <dabear> $.fn.add is different from Array.prototype.push
[04:23:34] <dabear> where push automatically updates the original object, .add returns a new object
[04:41:26] <muzone> At http://jsfiddle.net/dwaynie/XVqVD/ - is there a way to make #main-menu's dropdowns work despite #header's overflow: hidden? I tried setting #main-menu to overflow: visible; but that didn't do the trick.
[04:41:38] <muzone> Not sure whether this is a JS or CSS question, hope nobody's offended!
[04:55:28] <scr4ve> hey folks. Is there a reliable way to submit bugs to the bugtracker?
[04:56:06] <peol> scr4ve: What do you mean by 'reliable'?
[04:56:07] <scr4ve> I got a "Askimet spam ..." message :/
[04:56:37] <scr4ve> Solved the captcha -> "Askimet spam ..." again, no captcha to solve this time.
[04:57:15] <peol> That's odd, have you followed this? http://docs.jquery.com/How_to_Report_Bugs
[04:58:05] <scr4ve> yup.
[04:59:14] <scr4ve> http://pastebin.com/izHyzBZp - cannot submit that :/
[05:01:54] <peol> scr4ve: I would try submitting it with a different browser, or clear cache/cookies, Askimet might have marked you for some reason, I would also try changing around the title/description and see if you can get through.
[05:02:28] <peol> ajpiano: Do you know if there's been reports of difficulties submitting bugs?
[05:02:45] <scr4ve> peo: Tried that - Maximum number of posts per hour for this IP exceeded now   x(
[05:03:23] <scr4ve> peol*, sorry.
[05:05:08] <peol> scr4ve: Sorry to hear that, but here's why: http://forum.jquery.com/topic/trac-submissions-rejected-as-spam
[05:10:00] <xyz> fof? still there.. I know why it wasnt working
[05:12:50] <fof> yeah, what was wrong
[05:15:34] <xyz> code was executed b4 document.ready .. so it was on the wrong spot basically
[05:16:01] <xyz> discovered that when I put an alert popup in the function
[05:16:15] <xyz> (there was no alert)
[05:17:31] <fof> ah ok
[05:17:42] <fof> i should have asked about that :p
[05:17:51] <xyz> its ok =)
[05:18:45] <amitprakash> Hi.. how can I make a blocking ajax request i.e. I don't want the calling function to proceed until the ajax call's response is over
[05:19:25] <amitprakash> async: false should do it?
[05:24:04] <muzone> At http://jsfiddle.net/dwaynie/XVqVD/ - is there a way to make #main-menu's dropdowns work despite #header's overflow: hidden? I tried setting #main-menu to overflow: visible; but that didn't do the trick. Not sure if this is a JS or CSS question. Hope nobody's offended!
[05:32:53] <MeirD> Hello. I get a full HTML page in a response of an Ajax call. On the success function, I try to cast the html string to a jQuery object as : "function success(data) { jqueryData = $(data);  }". The problem is that when I do that, I see in Chrome console a call trying to download all pictures that were in the <img> tags of "data".
[05:32:58] <MeirD> Why does that happen?
[05:33:13] <K3|Chris> muzone: you're basically asking for overflow to be visibile with overflow:hidden on?
[05:33:27] <K3|Chris> muzone: do I need to bonk you on the head?
[05:33:38] <nathggns> MeirD
[05:33:55] <nathggns> do you need the whole page or can you just have the body?
[05:33:56] <henrico> guys is xpath seletors a plugin or is itpart of query core?
[05:34:04] <nathggns> MeirD ^^
[05:34:24] <MeirD> can have the body
[05:34:28] <nathggns> okay
[05:34:32] <nathggns> sec
[05:36:07] <nathggns> Actually, i can get the whole page, but it will only work in browsers that support outerHTML
[05:36:09] <nathggns> That cool?
[05:36:20] <nathggns> MeirD ^^
[05:36:59] <MeirD> yeah
[05:37:10] <MeirD> thnx
[05:37:15] <henrico> guys is xpath seletors a plugin or is itpart of query core?
[05:37:23] <mspalmer1> Hey, I've been looking for a tutorial to help me but I havn't found anything that specifically helps me. I have a menu I want to slide upwards over a bunch of images and then afterwards display another menu below the animated item. Could anybody help me out or at least point me in the right direction? The code/page is here: http://decorgroupinc.com/test/archmouldings-builder/#
[05:40:52] <Nomikos> mspalmer1: looks like an accordion menu
[05:41:39] <Nomikos> so you could google for that, or go here http://jqueryui.com/demos/accordion/
[05:43:10] <mspalmer1> Nomikos: Thanks, I'll punch that into the Googler right now
[05:43:25] <muzone> K3|Chris: haha
[05:44:04] <mspalmer1> Helped a lot thanks
[05:44:13] <Nomikos> cool
[05:44:38] <henrico> am i asking a hard qestion for you guys?by asking if path selectos is a plugin or part of jquery core?
[05:45:14] <muzone> K3|Chris: what options do I have though when it comes to making the dropdown work but at the same time contain the floats of #header?
[05:45:39] <K3|Chris> change the structure
[05:45:53] <K3|Chris> don't make the dropdowns be part of the mainmenu
[05:46:02] <nathggns> MeirD - https://gist.github.com/1908545
[05:46:17] <K3|Chris> or wrap the items in the menu wrapped in another element that is overflow hidden
[05:46:30] <K3|Chris> would allow main menu to overflow
[05:47:47] <K3|Chris> "css drop down menu" in google should yield some informative results
[05:47:51] <muzone> K3|Chris: interesting - not sure I understood your last suggestion there though
[05:49:08] <houssein> hello is there a way to prevent triggering the change event, when the slider value is changed programmatically, maybe be passing further arguments? I need to prevent it for specific situations. The change event is not triggered when the slider is initialized?
[05:49:25] <muzone> K3|Chris: you're right I should make a CSS version too
[05:49:36] <muzone> K3|Chris: but this one I beleive is far more usable
[05:51:54] <pflock> can anyone tell me why the lines here all have the same color: http://jsfiddle.net/u4Gpf/
[05:52:03] <K3|Chris> muzone: I meant for layout, you still need JS to make the dropdown work
[05:52:22] <fof> henrico: search the API for xpath and see what you find
[05:53:23] <henrico> fof i tryid to that in jquery documentation but no luck
[05:53:30] <muzone> K3|Chris: you're saying to put #main-menu in a wrapper that is overflow: hidden?
[05:53:38] <K3|Chris> no
[05:57:04] <fof> only mention i find is that xpath selectors are available as a plugin
[05:58:24] <fof> i think they used to be supported but not anymore
[06:03:22] <henrico> thank you fof
[06:04:34] <witchelles> hello
[06:05:21] <witchelles> please help me
[06:05:31] <fof> what happened
[06:05:39] <witchelles> hahaha
[06:06:04] <witchelles> would you mind looking at my code
[06:06:45] <Nomikos> jsfiddle it
[06:07:47] <witchelles> oks
[06:13:15] <muzone> At http://jsfiddle.net/dwaynie/krRFN/ - how do I use jQuery to use Verdana at 10px, but if Verdana doesn't exist, use sans-serif at 11px? It just looks so incredibly good to me in that size. With Arial or whatever it gets too tiny so...
[06:13:19] <witchelles> http://jsfiddle.net/3L7CX/1/
[06:13:24] <witchelles> I want something
[06:13:45] <Nomikos> Don't we all
[06:13:48] <witchelles> like when a user has unchecked the checkbox it should delete the permission
[06:15:48] <fof> with the current checkboxes, what behaviour is it you want
[06:16:20] <muzone> WARNING: Cute girl in my fiddle!!!
[06:16:31] <muzone> (plus the trailer to the new bob marley movie)
[06:17:03] <witchelles> @fof when a user has ticked the read checkbox it should disable add and approve
[06:17:25] <witchelles> but if the user has add&approve ticked read should be disabled
[06:18:09] <witchelles> + problem I had is when I'm submitting the record the first user_id is the updated instead of the clicked item
[06:18:12] <Nomikos> witchelles: suggestion: if a checkbox is clicked, use the class to set the url for the ajax, and base the action on whether it is currently checked or not
[06:18:15] <witchelles> I'm sorry
[06:18:50] <Nomikos> then you only need one ajax call, you have 5 or 6 now?
[06:18:51] <fof> ah i wish your html was readable
[06:20:29] <witchelles> am sorry I'll edit it out
[06:20:33] <muzone> At http://jsfiddle.net/dwaynie/krRFN/1/ - how do I use Verdana at 10px, but if Verdana doesn't exist, use sans-serif at 11px? My test case includes the trailer to that new Bob Marley movie plus a greeting from some girl.
[06:21:02] <K3|Chris> muzone: 10px/11px
[06:21:39] <witchelles> here
[06:21:39] <K3|Chris> font:10px/11px Verdana, sans-serif;

[06:22:06] <muzone> K3|Chris: wow really??
[06:22:43] <mehrdad> someone plz tell me is it possible to pass an event to a function and bind it in that function?
[06:23:20] <K3|Chris> http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/fonts.html#font-shorthand
[06:23:23] <K3|Chris> really
[06:23:45] <mehrdad> because the objects required in the binding logic is present only in the callee
[06:25:03] <muzone> marvellous !!
[06:25:10] <mehrdad> and i want it to be separate from the caller and not be mixed up
[06:25:14] <mehrdad> anyone?
[06:25:21] <muzone> lets grab a drink sometime K3|Chris
[06:25:27] <muzone> mehrdad is paying :)
[06:25:28] <mehrdad> i pass it and it says error undefined
[06:26:01] <mehrdad> i would if it was possible :D
[06:29:58] <mehrdad> muzone, can u plz confirm if this is a correct event object?
[06:29:58] <mehrdad> 	Object { type="divResize", timeStamp=1330179576886, jQuery164006535674471486608=true}
[06:29:58] <muzone> K3|Chris: doesnt that set 10px font-size and 11px line-height?
[06:30:21] <muzone> mehrdad: ive never played with even objects before :((
[06:30:26] <muzone> * event
[06:31:09] <mehrdad> ah ok]
[06:33:16] <ravenzz> muzone http://lucassmith.name/pub/font_installed.html
[06:33:44] <diverdude> In this example: http://jsfiddle.net/652fC/22/ what is actually happening when i do k = k.add(x); ? is a new array created and all elements copied or whats actually going on?
[06:36:25] <muzone> ravenzz: haha awesome :)))
[06:36:47] <mehrdad> anyone? :( http://pastebin.com/MbcAU8mY
[06:37:08] <mehrdad> i asked in the javascript channel and they suggested me this approach
[06:37:39] <mehrdad> tho somebody here told me the caller code block is not jquery which i can confirm
[06:38:30] <mehrdad> but the guy in #javascript which was here too, told me that simply calling .bind or .on would work
[06:38:43] <mehrdad> but it returns undefined error for the .bind function
[06:39:28] <mehrdad> gonna ask him again in the js channel, maybe i didn't get his point
[06:44:12] <diverdude> anyone?
[06:45:27] <muzone> ravenzz: do I need all that code?
[06:46:14] <ravenzz> there is probably a shorter version
[06:46:15] * anthonym codes up a storm.
[06:46:25] <ravenzz> google!
[06:47:17] <muzone> ravenzz: http://code.google.com/p/jquery-fontavailable/ ? :D
[06:47:38] * muzone hides
[06:49:01] <diverdude> ravenzz: do you have a moment ? :)
[06:49:27] <ravenzz> muzone you got it!?
[06:49:29] <ravenzz> :p
[06:49:43] <ravenzz> mh I have to go
[06:50:00] <diverdude> :S
[06:50:24] <ravenzz> diverdude what do you need help for?
[06:50:33] <zorba> How can I select closest parent element that contains text "asdfasdf"?
[06:50:58] <ravenzz> diverdude http://jsfiddle.net/652fC/22/ ?
[06:51:00] <diverdude> ravenzz: its just an understaning question, because i dont understand how .add() works
[06:52:05] <ravenzz> ?add @ diverdude
[06:52:07] <bot-t> diverdude, .add(selector): Add elements to the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/add/
[06:52:11] <ravenzz> easy.,
[06:52:17] <diverdude> ravenzz: yeah exactly...in that example i have var k=$([]); and in order to add elements i have to do k=k.add(x); but normally when using add to modify the dom you just do something like: $("p").add("span").css("background", "yellow");
[06:52:37] <diverdude> ravenzz:  why can i just do k.add(x); also then?
[06:52:59] <ravenzz> diverdude you should separate your code on jsfiddle
[06:53:01] <ravenzz> http://jsfiddle.net/f6Rua/
[06:53:13] <ravenzz> now click on the JSLint button
[06:53:19] <ravenzz> you have some errors. fix them
[06:53:43] <muzone> At http://jsfiddle.net/dwaynie/krRFN/3/ - I want to use 11px Verdana - if it's not installed - use 12px sans-serif. Am i doing it right? Fiddle includes new Bob Marley movie trailer plus a nice surprise (work safe).
[06:53:50] <ravenzz> there is a missing semicolon actually
[06:54:27] <diverdude> ravenzz: ok...fixed: http://jsfiddle.net/f6Rua/1/
[06:54:38] <diverdude> ravenzz: my question remains the same though :)
[06:56:10] <muzone> sorry allow me to rephrase
[06:56:15] <muzone> At http://jsfiddle.net/dwaynie/krRFN/3/ - I want to use 11px Verdana - if it's not installed - use 12px sans-serif. But is my syntax right and all?
[06:56:17] <diverdude> ravenzz: why is the usage of add dependent on the context?
[06:57:46] <ravenzz> diverdude http://jsfiddle.net/f6Rua/2/ ?
[06:58:44] <diverdude> ravenzz: huh??
[06:59:29] <diverdude> ravenzz: im not sure if you are reading my question :)
[07:00:39] <ravenzz> indeed..
[07:01:09] <ravenzz> i should go :\
[07:01:52] <muzone> yeah

[07:11:34] <fof> chuwiey: you aren't iterating over anything

[07:30:57] <fof> chuwiey: in your example you're getting the text() of the whole element, not anything lower down the tree
[07:31:02] <fof> seemed odd doing that with an each()
[07:44:06] <diverdude> How can i check if an object is a jquery object?
[07:46:02] <Wiz_KeeD> if i do $('select li.class') how can i find out how many elements of that description are in the dom?
[07:46:23] <diverdude> ahh the instanceof JQueru does the trick
[07:46:42] <Wiz_KeeD> what?
[07:46:56] <diverdude> Wiz_KeeD: maybe you can do  $('select li.class').length ?
[07:47:04] <Wiz_KeeD> i can try
[07:48:53] <Wiz_KeeD> i get 0 when there is one occurange
[07:48:55] <Wiz_KeeD> occurance
[07:49:29] <Wiz_KeeD> hmm
[07:49:33] <Wiz_KeeD> this says it should
[07:49:33] <Wiz_KeeD> http://api.jquery.com/size/
[07:50:00] <diverdude> Wiz_KeeD: did you try the size() function?
[07:52:14] <Wiz_KeeD> no, it worked it was my mistake
[07:52:22] <Wiz_KeeD> they also said use length instead of size
[07:53:23] <diverdude> Wiz_KeeD: are you a wizkid? A prodigy child ?
[07:53:49] <Wiz_KeeD> naw, i'm just a guy trying to make a living :))
[07:54:28] <diverdude> Wiz_KeeD: hehe me2 :D i just thought about your nickname
[07:54:38] <Wiz_KeeD> it's from dexter's laboratory
[07:54:43] <Wiz_KeeD> just written a bit funny
[07:54:43] <Wiz_KeeD> :)
[07:54:59] <diverdude> Wiz_KeeD: ohh wonderful :) i do so enjoy that cartoon
[07:55:06] <Wiz_KeeD> haha, me too :))
[07:55:16] <diverdude> deedee and dexter
[07:57:16] <diverdude> Wiz_KeeD: ever used the .each function?
[07:57:21] <Wiz_KeeD> yes i have
[07:58:50] <Wiz_KeeD> how do i access the actual text of an option not it's value <option value="">I want this text here</option>
[07:59:31] <diverdude> Wiz_KeeD: its funny....even though you do var k=$([]); k=k.add($('<div>hello</div>)); and then $.each(k,function(i,v){/* v is not a JQuery object*/});  Do you understand why?
[07:59:45] <Wiz_KeeD> woah that looks complicated!
[07:59:56] <Wiz_KeeD> i don't understand what's k to be hones
[08:00:09] <diverdude> Wiz_KeeD: its a jquery resultset
[08:00:15] <Wiz_KeeD> you lost me :)))
[08:00:19] <diverdude> basically just a container
[08:01:13] <diverdude> Wiz_KeeD: you can do $('selector').text() i think...also there is the .html()
[08:01:19] <Wiz_KeeD> yeah i just found that
[08:01:23] <Wiz_KeeD> thank you! :)
[08:01:42] <diverdude> Wiz_KeeD: no worries man :) Maybe you can answer my questoin now :D
[08:02:00] <Wiz_KeeD> if i knew i would glady be of service but it's too complicated for me
[08:02:14] <Wiz_KeeD> i can on the other hand give you a business opportunity in the real world
[08:02:23] <diverdude> yeah its quite hardcore stuff
[08:02:41] <diverdude> Wiz_KeeD: whats the business opportunity ?
[08:02:48] <Wiz_KeeD> talk in pm
[08:06:18] <peterschmidler> Why doesn't this work? $("#loading").css("top: 100px");
[08:06:52] <fof> see the api
[08:07:21] <diverdude> Peterman: you do  $("#loading").css("top","100px");
[08:07:29] <fof> http://api.jquery.com/css/
[08:07:36] <peterschmidler> diverdude: Cool, Thanks!
[08:07:45] <diverdude> Peterman: no worries mate
[08:11:48] <becom33> http://pastebin.com/BGhhK2H3 can anyone tell me what Im doing wrong here ?
[08:13:00] <razzi> become .. display none makes the div invisible to js
[08:16:17] <becom33> razzi, lemme remove that and see
[08:16:27] <nFFF> thats not the issue
[08:16:30] <nFFF> your code is fine
[08:16:49] <nFFF> what razzi said makes no sense :<
[08:16:53] <nFFF> http://jsfiddle.net/ZSjPq/
[08:17:05] <razzi> ok then, i am mistaken
[08:17:32] <becom33> nFFF, I dont want that div to be visible when the page loads I want it to visibile when I click the button
[08:17:58] <nFFF> its not visible on page load
[08:18:01] <nFFF> check my link?
[08:18:15] <becom33> nFFF, loading . net is kinda slow today :(
[08:18:33] <becom33> shit FF crashed :/
[08:19:43] <becom33> nFFF, Then why is it doesnt work for me :/
[08:20:13] <nFFF> ?
[08:20:30] <nFFF> The link? when you click the button, toggles your div that contains 'hi'
[08:20:55] <becom33> what 'hi' ?
[08:21:13] <lord_D> i made a regexp that i want to use to match a string. can jquery do that?
[08:21:20] <becom33> I saw your link . its the same what I pasted right ?
[08:21:31] <nFFF> sorry 'lol'
[08:21:46] <nFFF> Yes I putnit in jsfiddle to show you it works
[08:21:57] <nFFF> lord_D, what do you mean
[08:22:12] <becom33> nFFF, wondering why it didnt work for me :/
[08:22:21] <nFFF> wha doesn't work for you?
[08:23:30] <becom33> nop .. wait I have huge page , can I pm you the paste link private ?
[08:23:42] <nFFF> no
[08:23:42] <lord_D> nFFF, i want to retrieve text from a meta refresh tag's content attribute and chop off the "1;URL='"
[08:23:57] <djQuery> anyone know of a mashup between something like piratepad and jsfiddle\jsbin?
[08:24:10] <nFFF> lord_D, and whats wrong with JS native match?
[08:24:14] <djQuery> to where 2 people can work coloborate on the same code
[08:24:47] <nFFF> becom33 make sure you have included jquery on your page etc
[08:24:49] <becom33> wait lemme try somthing
[08:25:06] <lord_D> nFFF, can i use that function if i am not calling it from inside a browser?
[08:25:23] <becom33> yes I did .. but I have alota js in the script .. need to get away from n see whats the problem . gimme a sec
[08:25:56] <nFFF> lord_D,  where else will you be calling ?
[08:26:42] <lord_D> nFFF, the script is a command line that stays on a server
[08:27:11] <Wiz_KeeD> alert($('#client_id .default').text()); this .default is an option from a select tag
[08:27:18] <Wiz_KeeD> and i cannot see the text, any ideeas?
[08:27:30] <nFFF> Im confused, if you can run jQuery whereever your running this scrip... you can run JS methods... jquery is js..
[08:27:53] <nFFF> ?val
[08:27:54] <bot-t> .val(): Get the current value of the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/val/
[08:29:47] <Wiz_KeeD> fixed it! :)
[08:31:57] <minna> Hello
[08:32:24] <minna> Is document.domain a reliable way to do cross-subdomain communication?
[08:34:00] <diverdude> minna: what sort of communication?
[08:34:48] <minna> diverdude: posting a short string and returning the response.
[08:35:12] <diverdude> minna: why not just use a cookie?
[08:35:38] <minna> i need to fetch data from my api server
[08:35:53] <minna> and i cannot have thos on the same machine
[08:36:01] <diverdude> but you have to do it via the client?
[08:36:09] <minna> diverdude: yes
[08:36:17] <diverdude> minna: why?
[08:36:23] <minna> diverdude: the cms does not allow custom code, so have to do it via javascript
[08:36:27] <becom33> nFFF http://pastebin.com/iP8y1VQe
[08:36:32] <becom33> This is my code
[08:36:48] <minna> becom33: good for you :-)
[08:37:28] <becom33> minna, no no it doesnt work :/
[08:37:44] <minna> becom33: please set it up on jsfiddle instead
[08:39:08] <becom33> :/ cant put <script> tag in javascript box right ?
[08:39:51] <minna> becom33: um what??
[08:40:34] <diverdude> becom33: no need to
[08:40:45] <diverdude> becom33: just put your stuff in the js box
[08:41:52] <minna> oh
[08:41:55] <minna> yeah
[08:41:56] <diverdude> minna: im sharing session information between 2 servers by passing a cookie with the session id
[08:43:05] <minna> diverdude: but doesnt that allow everyone to do the same?
[08:45:13] <diverdude> sure if they know the session-id, which ofc. may be seen in the cookie. but there isn't really any other way to identify the session....thats usually how sessions work. sessionid is stored in a cookie
[08:46:54] <fotoflo> quick question about .fadeIn()  :   how should i be hiding elements before fading them in?
[08:48:17] <diverdude> fotoflo: hide()?
[08:48:50] <minna> diverdude: yes, but how to the receiving server know what the session id is
[08:49:47] <diverdude> minna: its posted in the cookie. as long as different servers runs on the same domain or subdomain they share cookies
[08:49:51] <fotoflo> diverdude: currently i am currently setting .off{ display:none !important; } in css
[08:50:01] <diverdude> minna: i have a shares sessionstorage on the server
[08:50:06] <diverdude> shares=shared
[08:50:12] <fotoflo> i should be hiding them on page load?
[08:50:28] <fotoflo> or rather $.hide()'ing
[08:50:43] <diverdude> fotoflo: dont use display:none
[08:50:57] <minna> diverdude: hm, cookies are shared between subdomains?
[08:51:07] <diverdude> minna: yes i believe so
[08:51:26] <ningu> is there a simple way for me to make my table columns resizeable using jquery ui Resizables? I don't want a whole data grid framework. I just want the columns resizable. but Resizable doesn't seem to work very well.
[08:53:05] <minna> diverdude: but i still dont understand how the recieving end knows it's from an authorized source.
[08:53:22] <minna> diverdude: the only thing the api server would see is a random number.
[08:53:27] <ningu> btw sorry if this is not the right place for asking about jquery ui. there doesn't seem to be another channel.
[08:53:51] <tocka> Hey guys, I have this form to validate, it valides perfectly, but I want it to prompt out an error like alert(); but it doesnt do anything
[08:53:51] <tocka> http://pastebin.com/UybpL67s
[08:53:52] <tocka> :/
[08:54:56] <diverdude> minna: it can check in the session storage if the sessionID is authorized
[08:55:49] <minna> diverdude: yes but in my case the sessions are created on the other server so i cannot verify that
[08:55:52] <diverdude> minna: imagine you save the sessionstate in a database or some memlib like memcached or redis
[08:56:18] <diverdude> minna: sure you can...as long as both severs have access to the same memory space
[08:56:34] <diverdude> minna: e.g. a database server or whatever
[08:56:40] <minna> diverdude: yeah but they dont
[08:56:53] <minna> diverdude: and it would require the user is registered
[08:57:01] <minna> diverdude: in this case
[08:57:13] <minna> diverdude: i appreciate the suggestion though
[08:57:28] <fotoflo> $("#a").dialog({options}).append('<div> id = "myDiv"');  $("#myDiv").hide() ;   is there a more elegant way to do this?
[08:58:09] <diverdude> minna: no worries
[08:59:37] <muzone> At http://jsfiddle.net/dwaynie/krRFN/10/ makes the body use 11px Verdana - if Verdana isn't installed - it sets it to 12px sans-serif. But can somebody who doesn't have Verdana try it and see if it works?
[09:06:35] <tocka> Hey guys, I have this form to validate, it valides perfectly, but I want it to prompt out an error like alert(); but it doesnt do anything
[09:06:47] <tocka> http://pastebin.com/UybpL67s
[09:07:33] <wojtek> hi
[09:08:08] <wojtek> I've read that in 1.8 jqXHR.success() and error() will be deprecated
[09:09:44] <wojtek> I’m using them in my code. But I have one question. In success when the request is successful you have to check e.g if there is an eror like if (json.error)
[09:09:52] <wojtek> do I have to check it in done?
[09:11:32] <wojtek> ah, I use jsonp
[09:11:36] <diverdude> If i do: var k = $([]); x = $('<div><span>howdy</span></div>');  k = k.add(x); k[0].css("background-color","blue"); i get this error: Uncaught TypeError: Object #<HTMLDivElement> has no method 'css' Why ?
[09:13:59] <wojtek> hm, so my question is: can I use done & fail wtih JSONP?
[09:17:31] <tocka> Has anyone tried triggering a slider? :/
[09:19:04] <diverdude> tocka: triggering a slider?
[09:22:04] <tocka> diverdude, how to say, I have a contact form which is divided in to 2 pages, 1st slide(everything has to be filled in) 2nd slide(optional) but you can only find the submit button on 2nd slide, so when a person presses submit and if there is an error on the first slide I would like it to go back
[09:22:29] <tocka> So i guess I would have to trigger the #back link for the slider
[09:24:32] <diverdude> tocka: i have no idea what a slider is
[09:24:50] <tocka> A moment
[09:25:36] <tocka> This is what im using http://slidesjs.com/, but instead of pictures you have a contact form
[09:26:20] <diverdude> tocka: i suppose there is some function which slides to a specified slide
[09:26:43] <joicant> hey.. is there a way to get a reference to the element for which the event happened when using the "new live() stuff": $(document).on('click', $('.some-element'), function () { alert(this); });
[09:27:04] <joicant> this points to HTMLDocument in this case, and not to the $('.some-element') instance
[09:27:16] <diverdude> tocka: there are next() and prev()
[09:27:25] <diverdude> tocka: you can use prev()
[09:28:35] <joicant> here's my answer: $(document).on('click', $('.some-element'), function (event) { alert(event.target); });
[09:28:42] <chachan> guys, I have this: http://jsfiddle.net/chachan/QhGcm/1, that JS is deleting everything inside _article_, any one familiar with this behavior?
[09:28:43] <joicant> "..  and event.target indicates the deepest (innermost) element where the event occurred."
[09:29:18] <kanzie> oh man, if I load XML using ajax and parse with parseXML (or DOMParser) it leaks memory. If I don't parse the XML it does not leak at all. But if I load the XML from local var it does not leak either, this makes no sense
[09:30:59] <chuwiey> hello all, is there any way for me to change the id of an element using jquery?
[09:32:55] <tocka> diverdude
[09:33:06] <tocka> should it be anything like this ? http://pastebin.com/AEkXh49q
[09:35:00] <diverdude> tocka: i dont think so
[09:35:16] <diverdude> tocka: probably more like $("#slides").prev();
[09:35:30] <tocka> Lets try:)
[09:35:57] <minna> diverdude: I think i could do a jsonp request and then at the server validate the domain and ip that is requesting the data. Would that work?
[09:36:13] <chuwiey> anyone? (change the id of an element with jquery?)
[09:40:49] <diverdude> minna: i suppose you can do that. what would you verify the ip against?
[09:43:33] <ravenzz> minna what are you trying to do?
[09:43:50] <ravenzz> diverdude did you solved your issue?
[09:45:05] <diverdude> ravenzz: well.. it wasn't really an issue it it was more like trying to understand how the .add() function works
[09:45:57] <ravenzz> I see
[09:47:36] <minna> diverdude: Right, it's the client that's posting and headers can be manipulared.. darnit
[09:47:57] <minna> ravenzz: trying to send data to subdomain securely.
[09:48:12] <minna> ravenzz: but that won't work without verifying the session id
[09:48:33] <diverdude> ravenzz: because if i want to add elements to an object $k=$([]); I have to do k = k.add($('<div>')); but if i use it on a selector like $('#someid') i can do like $('#someid').add("span"). I dont understand why there is this difference
[09:48:43] <ravenzz> securely ? in which sense
[09:49:10] <tocka> Still, I think Im too dumb, my trigger doesnt do anything :|
[09:49:11] <tocka> jQuery('#slider').trigger($("#slides").prev());
[09:49:27] <minna> ravenzz: so that only users on the main domain can get a response.
[09:49:28] <diverdude> tocka: why trigger() ?
[09:49:52] <tocka> diverdude how else im going to call the function without clicking on it
[09:49:56] <minna> ravenzz: i thought of using document.domain setting but that can also be faked.
[09:50:34] <diverdude> tocka: just call $("#slides").prev() from wherever
[09:51:32] <ravenzz> minna so, when I do ajax stuffs I create an hash so the user can't fake stuffs.
[09:52:43] <ravenzz> anyway it is for a different purpose
[09:52:52] <ravenzz> minna are you performing an ajax request?
[09:55:12] <minna> ravenzz: Yeah, but the problem is i cannot verify the user who is requesting the data.
[09:56:28] <minna> ravenzz: anyway, i'm now absolutely sure it cannot be done.
[09:59:59] <MeirD> Hey! How come when I use a $each() inside a function, the local varibales of the function are not recognized inside the $.each loop ?
[10:00:04] <ravenzz> minna http://pastebin.com/caKSF4uU
[10:00:21] <ravenzz> you could hash the user ID + secretkey
[10:00:37] <ravenzz> or something. I don't know how your app is organized
[10:01:49] <minna> ravenzz: That is a good suggestion, if only i could run php on the sending server.. :-(
[10:01:50] <Es0teric> how does the scope of the .hover() method work
[10:01:51] <Es0teric> ?
[10:02:22] <ravenzz> ohh that is a big handicap
[10:02:51] <minna> ravenzz: it's a showstopper unfortunately.
[10:03:08] <minna> ravenzz: and i did not know minna is tit in italian ;-)
[10:03:18] <ravenzz> ahah lol
[10:03:42] <minna> ravenzz: now i understand why you help me all the time :-D
[10:03:55] <diverdude> ravenzz: do you know the answer to my question?
[10:03:56] <ravenzz> rotfl
[10:04:31] <diverdude> ravenzz: my nick also means tit in italian :D
[10:04:36] <minna> ravenzz: you dirty boy there ;-) *give a good spanking*
[10:04:52] <minna> diverdude: LOL
[10:05:15] <ravenzz> another fun word is pene (which in norway mean nice, beautiful or something like that). It is the italian for penis
[10:05:58] <K3|Chris> isn't pene a kind of pasta?
[10:06:05] <ravenzz> penne
[10:06:09] <minna> lol
[10:06:13] <K3|Chris> norwegians are known to be crazed
[10:06:33] <tocka> diverdude my whole "thing" looks like this now, and still, when I press submit, it doesnt do anything :|
[10:06:34] <tocka> http://pastebin.com/30LckzjY
[10:07:01] <ravenzz> diverdude ahah no I don't think so
[10:07:13] <minna> I laughed my ass of when Hondy launched their car named "fitta" in the nordic countries in 2001. Fitta in swedish means pussy.
[10:07:38] <diverdude> tocka: does you element which contain the slider have id="slides" ?
[10:07:38] <ravenzz> diverdude anyway my first impression is that $([]) is wrong, even though it work
[10:07:50] <diverdude> ravenzz: why is that?
[10:08:10] <diverdude> ravenzz: i mean its just a way of wrapping an array, for ease of use
[10:08:45] <ravenzz> It looks like more like an empty jquery object to me
[10:08:54] <ravenzz> but I am not 100% sure
[10:09:26] <diverdude> ravenzz: i can add objects to it using add()...so i guess it must be some sort of container
[10:09:39] <tocka> diverdude, it has the id #slider but Iv changed it now and still nothing :|
[10:09:40] <ravenzz> yeah it is
[10:09:48] <ravenzz> diverdude http://jsfiddle.net/5WXaR/
[10:09:49] <diverdude> ravenzz: strange thing is however i need to catch the output of the add
[10:10:44] <diverdude> ravenzz: yeah ofc. its an array wrapped in a jquery object
[10:10:45] <ravenzz> can you give me the link again?
[10:10:52] <diverdude> ravenzz: me?
[10:10:56] <ravenzz> yes
[10:11:08] <diverdude> http://jsfiddle.net/f6Rua/8/
[10:11:26] <diverdude> tocka: make a jsfiddle testcase
[10:11:31] <minna> bye guys :
[10:11:32] <minna> :)
[10:11:34] <minna> have fun
[10:14:15] <ravenzz> diverdude I am not sure what are you trying to do there.
[10:14:26] <ravenzz> but basically you need to add x to k ?
[10:14:38] <diverdude> ravenzz: yeah exactly
[10:14:42] <henrico> lame question, trying to get jquery's idea i realized it is all about $() right? even when we use var something = someotherthing eventualy we ends up using ($(something) right?
[10:14:57] <henrico> even plugin we create is passed to $()
[10:15:04] <henrico> it is all about $()
[10:15:04] <diverdude> ravenzz: and it works fine in that example...i just find it odd that i have to do k = k.add(...)
[10:15:09] <henrico> is that it?
[10:15:20] <ravenzz> ah I see
[10:15:53] <diverdude> henrico: $() wraps jquery functionality
[10:15:59] <ravenzz> diverdude maybe it is because of the code organization
[10:16:11] <ravenzz> can you explain me the purpose of this script?
[10:16:54] <diverdude> ravenzz: not really a purpose..just a demo script hehe...im building a chatsystem where chatwindow elements are added and removed from an array
[10:19:50] <diverdude> ravenzz: because funny thing is that other kinds of jquery id i dont have to save the output
[10:19:55] <diverdude> ravenzz: like:  $('#someid').add("span")
[10:20:12] <diverdude> ravenzz: maybe its when objects are attached to the dom or something
[10:20:21] <mxyzptlkxz00> im searching a slideshow script that zoom pictures from small to big
[10:24:43] <tocka> diverdude i cant use jsFiddle because the site is on localhost :|
[10:25:15] <diverdude> tocka: hence: make a testcase ;)
[10:25:30] <diverdude> tocka: its also good for learning
[10:26:15] <tocka> I know it is :| the thing is I have never used it before :D
[10:27:00] <tocka> I was thinking, maybe calling the function like this jQuery("#slider").slides.prev();
[10:27:05] <tocka> would make it work? :o
[10:28:00] <diverdude> ?tias
[10:28:01] <bot-t> Try It And See
[10:28:35] <kanzie> Im trying to get rid of line breaks and whitespaces in my xml-string. I've tried .replace(/(\r\n|\n|\r)/gm,""); but it still has a break in there...
[10:28:46] <kanzie> how can I find out what character it is I should remove?
[10:28:52] <diverdude> tocka: i cannot debug your problem if i cannot see it :)
[10:28:57] <kanzie> sorry, not really jQuery
[10:29:02] <kanzie> I'll ask in js
[10:29:46] <tocka> jQuery("#slider").slides.prev is not a function
[10:29:47] <tocka> hah
[10:29:55] <tocka> Thats what firebug tells me
[10:31:41] <diverdude> tocka: so it didnt work :)
[10:31:57] <tocka> Yep, it didint :D
[10:33:47] <diverdude> tocka: just write a simple mockup on jsfiddle where you try to slide forward and backward
[10:49:19] <aqeel> hi room
[10:49:37] <aqeel> guys i am having a logic issue here...
[10:49:56] <wookiehangover> how illogical of you
[10:50:03] <aqeel> well according to code it should not hide but is hiding...
[10:50:11] <logic> and I get highlighted* for no reason
[10:51:50] <Nomikos> aqeel: comment out line 14
[10:52:38] <aqeel> well i have a hover() on div....show/hide.....and within i have li......it is also on hover() show/hide but when i click li it must show ...
[10:52:47] <aqeel> ???nomikos
[10:52:49] <Nomikos> can you put it up on jsfiddle?
[10:52:58] <Nomikos> without code or a url we can't help..
[10:53:21] <aqeel> jailbreak.webege.com/advance.html
[10:55:49] <Nomikos> aqeel: all the submenus are in the mainmenu div?
[10:56:18] <aqeel> no they are loaded into seperate div (loadsubmenu)
[10:59:33] <aqeel> tech js is the coding file
[11:01:03] <Nomikos> I guess when you click the li, that triggers the mainmenu hide, and that in turn triggers the submenucontenthide
[11:01:39] <aqeel> how can i break that
[11:01:45] <Nomikos> well, the #mainmenucontent.hover() second function (mouseout) is triggered, which hides the submenucontenthide
[11:02:05] <aqeel> $("#submenucontent").css("display","block").removeClass("submenucontenthide");
[11:02:10] <aqeel> this is there though
[11:02:13] <sam113101> is there a way to do that: $("ul").append("<li>test</li>").click(function);
[11:02:22] <sam113101> so that when you click teh new li, the function is called
[11:02:35] <sam113101> .append doesn't return teh new li, but the ul instead
[11:02:48] <sam113101> I think
[11:03:01] <Nomikos> aqeel: yeah, but that's after the mainmenu hides
[11:03:11] <Nomikos> maybe if you switch the order of those lines it works..
[11:04:00] <aqeel> no ....what i want is the submenu to show.....mainmenu will hide when clicked
[11:04:23] <aqeel> u see after clicking from mainmenu submenu hides too
[11:04:36] <Nomikos> yeah I see what is happening
[11:04:37] <aqeel> mainmenu hides, submenu should show
[11:05:33] <Nomikos> can you give the submenu a class 'active' on click, and only hide the submenu in the mainmenu mouseout event (second hover callback) if there is /no/ active class?
[11:05:35] <aqeel> this is interfering...$("#mainmenucontent") 		.hover( 			function(){ 				$(".submenu,.submenucontenthide,.submenulime").addClass("green"); 				$(".submenucontenthide").css("display","block"); 				$(".submenulime").text("Menu - Preview");}, 			function(){ 				$(".submenu,.submenucontenthide,.submenulime").removeClass("green"); 				$(".submenucontenthide").css("display","none"); 				});
[11:05:37] <Nomikos> something like that
[11:06:03] <aqeel> ok i can try that...
[11:06:04] <Nomikos> yeah... that's what jsfiddle or urls are for, usually :-p
[11:06:23] <aqeel> sorry forgot...1 min
[11:06:23] <Nomikos> (people frown upon too much code being pasted in this channel, for future reference)
[11:07:09] <aqeel> http://jsfiddle.net/5x8ta/
[11:07:56] <aqeel>  $(".submenucontenthide").css("display", "none");..................commenting this line works...but then the code is broken
[11:08:15] <Nomikos> right. in the second function, only hide the submenu if it doesn't have the class 'active', which you can add from the <li> click
[11:08:46] <aqeel> thanks...
[11:08:53] <Nomikos> does that make sense?
[11:08:53] <aqeel> trying out now
[11:08:57] <Nomikos> okie
[11:08:59] <aqeel> i got it
[11:09:35] <Nomikos> funky interface btw, writing a game?
[11:10:31] <aqeel> no....contents of page is really something i have in really i mean it.....a huge databse.....everything related to jailbreak
[11:10:45] <MeirD> How can I select all DIVs with have specific innerText?
[11:10:46] <Nomikos> ah right
[11:11:06] <aqeel> so for autoscroll and controlling them
[11:11:50] <Nomikos> MeirD: http://api.jquery.com/contains-selector/ maybe
[11:11:54] <aqeel> main.....jailbreak.webege.com
[11:11:54] <Nomikos> never used it
[11:12:43] <MeirD> thnx
[11:16:37] <aqeel> sorry.....nomikos where should i be putting this second hover .....under mainmenu or loadsubmenu?
[11:17:14] <Nomikos> aqeel: you don't need a second hover, you can just edit the second function in the current hover
[11:17:30] <Nomikos> The one that runs on mouseout for the mainmenu and hides the submenu?
[11:17:39] <aqeel> ok...
[11:17:43] <Nomikos> sec
[11:19:56] <aqeel> http://jsfiddle.net/eFCTE/1/
[11:20:07] <aqeel> html and js
[11:21:58] <Nuno147> Hi, Please help with a small question : Is it possible to search for a specific class on only a partial of an html ? for example I have a table and I have a click event which provide me with the current row using $(this). I would like to search for a class *only* in the specific row (tr). can it be done >
[11:22:04] <Nuno147> ?
[11:22:41] <Nomikos> $(this).find('myClass')
[11:23:28] <Nomikos> ehr, or if that $(this) doesn't refer to the row but the clicked element in that, go from what you're using for the tr. find('myClass'), anyway
[11:23:36] <Nomikos> ...
[11:24:42] <penk> hey folks, this is an odd question.  i'm going ot be travelling and doing some developing while on the road - i'm relatively new to jquery - cna i download the API docs locally?  I'll be spending many hours on a plane, I'd love to have localized references.
[11:25:20] <sam113101> is there a shorter way to do this
[11:25:22] <sam113101> $("ul").append("<li>penis</li>").find("li").last().click(function(){
[11:25:22] <sam113101>     alert($(this).text());
[11:25:22] <sam113101> });
[11:25:42] <sam113101> dammit
[11:26:34] <sam113101> I always use bad words when testing something
[11:27:16] <Nomikos> sam113101: look into the newer .on() method
[11:27:30] <Nomikos> you can specify event handlers for elements that are not yet in the DOM
[11:27:34] <tocka> Hey, I have this proble, I am validating a form and if theres an error I want the slider to go back 1 slide
[11:27:34] <tocka> http://pastebin.com/dUPJp183
[11:27:39] <tocka> But it doesnt work :/
[11:27:54] <sam113101> Nomikos: how?
[11:27:58] <tocka> im using this slider btw http://slidesjs.com/
[11:28:13] <Nomikos> sam113101: with the on() methid
[11:28:22] <Nomikos> *method - http://api.jquery.com/on/
[11:29:28] <Nomikos> aqeel: where is the click handler for the main menu items?
[11:30:40] <aqeel> mainmenu()
[11:30:43] <aqeel> function
[11:31:20] <sam113101> Nomikos: basically, when I "on" something, it will not only work on the existing "objects" but also on those that I create later?
[11:31:30] <Nomikos> sam113101: correct
[11:31:44] <sam113101> that's nice
[11:31:52] <Nomikos> sam113101: though you have to specify a root element as the first selector that will always be available, to catch the event
[11:32:01] <aqeel> loaded is where u want to look for what is happening......as that is loading the submenu
[11:32:12] <Nomikos> $(document) works nicely, but may not always be optimal.. just some parent element that's loaded from the start should work
[11:32:24] <sam113101> ok
[11:32:26] <Uncle_Mother> hi - i have a cell in every row of a table that I want to be able to click to slide open or closed - without making an id for each row, can i somehow attach a click to the cell that slides open/closed just that cell (it will have a div in it)
[11:33:22] <Nomikos> aqeel: it's not much, but http://jsfiddle.net/uAEEy/ - that's the last part of tech.js
[11:33:52] <Nomikos> aqeel: but you still have to add that 'active' class to the submenu when you click an element, couldn't figure out where that was happening exactly
[11:34:08] <aqeel> oh...
[11:34:14] <Nomikos> you have a strange mix of jquery inits and functions
[11:34:23] <aqeel> that is external file
[11:35:03] <aqeel> $("#loadsubmenu").load("submenu.html","#submenucontent");
[11:35:37] <Nomikos> I'mma have to say "good luck with it" :-) need to get back to my own project for a bit
[11:35:55] <aqeel> thanks for great help
[11:36:09] <Nomikos> np, hope you get it worked out
[11:36:46] <tocka> Nomikos maybe you can help me with my problem? :/
[11:37:34] <Nomikos> tocka: sorry, not familiar with that plugin
[11:37:42] <tocka> Oh ok :)
[11:37:44] <tocka> Thanks tho
[11:38:01] <sam113101> Nomikos: doesn't work on the newly created li "wat"
[11:38:03] <sam113101> $("ul li").on("click", function(event){
[11:38:03] <sam113101>     alert($(this).text());
[11:38:03] <sam113101> });
[11:38:03] <sam113101> $("ul").append("<li>wat</li>");
[11:38:08] <sam113101> what's wrong?
[11:38:16] <Nomikos> tocka: is the part where you call prev() running at all? that is, is variable errors truthy?
[11:39:05] <Nomikos> sam113101: close, try $('ul').on('click', 'li', function(event) { ..
[11:39:17] <imsky> saturdayyyyy caturdayyyy
[11:39:30] <tocka> Nomikos I call it when there are errors in the form jQuery("#slider").prev();
[11:39:34] <tocka> But it doesnt work
[11:39:34] <tocka> :|
[11:40:38] <sam113101> Nomikos: thank you
[11:40:53] <Nomikos> tocka: prev() is a jquery method that just changes the selected set, should it do something else?
[11:41:42] <Nomikos> sam113101: also, please use jsfiddle for 3 or more lines of code, that way it's easier to troubleshoot and to edit in fixes
[11:41:58] <Nomikos> (and it makes for less scrollback in the channel, which is nice too..)
[11:42:17] <sam113101> ok
[11:43:08] <bradhe> is there a way to get a dom element that occurs at a given point? I'm basically rolling something similar to draggable/droppable and need to find a drop target (or closest drop target) given a point.
[11:44:42] <Nomikos> define point
[11:44:57] <tocka> Nomikos there is a function prev() for the slider
[11:45:08] * Nomikos tries to ignore the project work staring at him
[11:45:36] <tocka> Nomikos if you would just scroll down you would see prev(string)
[11:46:08] <Nomikos> scroll down where?
[11:47:59] <Nomikos> I'm not seeing a prev() method for the jqueryui slider documentation, fwiw..
[11:48:21] <aqeel> nomikos..................................................thanksssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss
[11:48:28] <Nomikos> o_O
[11:48:50] <aqeel> if (){}....helped
[11:48:55] <Nomikos> you're.. welcome?
[11:48:58] <Nomikos> ok :)
[11:52:08] <tocka> Nomikos maybe then there is a way then to trigger the back link somehow?
[11:52:09] <tocka> :/
[11:52:29] <Nomikos> tocka: I have no idea what the rest of your code or even page looks like
[11:53:07] <Nomikos> tocka: but from what I hear what you're stuck on is not related to the validation plugin, just to how to get back somewhere
[11:54:04] <Nomikos> in which case history.go(-1) might work?
[11:55:34] <aqeel> bye....got to go......nomikos....;) thanks
[11:55:44] * Nomikos waves
[11:55:48] <tocka> Nomikos but history.go(-1) Would refresh the page and I cant do that :|
[11:56:24] <Nomikos> well, if you want to go back but you don't want to go back, what exactly do you want to do? show an alert and return false?
[11:58:27] <Es0teric|AFK> can anyone tell me how the scope works for .hover()?
[12:02:43] <tocka>  how to say, I have a contact form which is divided in to 2 pages, 1st slide(everything has to be filled in) 2nd slide(optional) but you can only find the submit button on 2nd slide, so when a person presses submit and if there is an error on the first slide I would like it to go back
[12:02:44] <tocka> So i guess I would have to trigger the #back link for the slider
[12:03:20] <Nomikos> what slider are you using?
[12:03:55] <Nomikos> and are these two forms on one page, but just hidden in turn, or on two seperate page requests?
[12:04:14] <tocka> Hidden
[12:04:16] <tocka> Im using
[12:04:21] <Nomikos> jsfiddle?
[12:04:28] <Nomikos> (or url)
[12:04:30] <tocka> This slidder
[12:04:31] <tocka> http://slidesjs.com/
[12:04:32] <tocka> :/
[12:05:53] <Nomikos> uh, so the example there is $('#slides').slides({prev: 'prev'});
[12:06:46] <Nomikos> the "prev (string)" is not saying you should call prev method with a string, just that the prev /property/ /is/ a string
[12:09:34] <Nomikos> I am *guessing* it refers to the classname of the prev button
[12:09:43] <tocka> Whell yeah it does
[12:09:49] <tocka> But then how to call it properly?
[12:13:09] <Nomikos> dunno, can't work it out right now
[12:14:29] <tocka> Nomikos maybe its possible to use somekind of function which would "click" that Back link
[12:14:35] <tocka> I dont know how to explain it properly..
[12:15:48] <Nomikos> possibly - I've never used that slide plugin and can't easily see it from the docs. try to find more examples maybe
[12:16:33] <Nomikos> or you could just script it from scratch, with css position and animate()
[12:16:35] <diverdude> How do i make private methods in a jquery plugin?
[12:20:01] <pifantastic> ?p @ diverdude
[12:20:01] <bot-t> diverdude, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[12:20:24] <pifantastic> diverdude: to tell you that I would basically have to explain Javascript scoping, which is a big subject
[12:21:51] <diverdude> pifantastic: haha no you wouldn't
[12:22:31] <pifantastic> if you're asking that question you don't understand javascript scoping
[12:24:17] <nFFF> Its true
[12:24:46] <nFFF> Although it easy to understand, everything within your methods constructor is basically private
[12:25:10] <john_doe_jr> Why doesn't the following work?  jQuery(document).ready(function ($) { $("#datepicker").datepicker(); });  <p>Prepared for date range <input type=\"text\" id=\"datepicker\"></p>....I keep getting a Uncaught TypeError: Object #<Object> has no method 'datepicker' ...?
[12:25:11] <Es0teric> how does the scope work for the .hover() method?
[12:25:32] <pifantastic> john-dev: you arent loading jquery ui correctly
[12:25:39] <pifantastic> crap
[12:25:51] <pifantastic> john_doe_jr: you arent loading jquery ui correctly
[12:25:52] <john_doe_jr> pifantastic: how do I do it correctly then?
[12:25:54] <diverdude> pifantastic: in case you didnt know you can just do: var dostuff1 = function(){}; :) just like normal :)
[12:26:08] <pifantastic> diverdude: right.
[12:26:24] <pifantastic> john_doe_jr: make sure you load it *after* jquery
[12:26:33] <pifantastic> and confirm that it is indeed loading and not 404ing
[12:26:38] <john_doe_jr> pifantastic: I'm sorry I don't understand
[12:26:44] <pifantastic> and make sure you arent doing any weird noConflict() stuff
[12:27:31] <nFFF> Your missing (jQuery) of the end of your function
[12:27:37] <diverdude> pifantastic: so you saw how you can explain scoping in a single line when a question like that comes up ;) You don't have to assume the worst
[12:28:04] <codepal> why is it in a userscript my dynamically added content once on('click' is run I can't then do another on('click event ??
[12:28:11] <john_doe_jr> nFFF: so your saying I have to put in (JQuery) @ the end?
[12:28:16] <nFFF> Yes
[12:28:25] <pifantastic> diverdude: why on earth would you think you couldn't declare a function in a jquery plugin? I have have to assume the worst.
[12:28:50] <diverdude> pifantastic: so just say that..how hard can it be
[12:28:53] <nFFF> (function($){  /* your shit goes here cuz */ })(jQuery);
[12:29:04] <codepal> I'm looking at http://stackoverflow.com/questions/203198/jquery-event-binding-on-dynamically-created-elements
[12:29:28] <codepal> and they recommend just shoving my code in a seperate function
[12:29:36] <diverdude> pifantastic: you also dont
[12:29:38] <john_doe_jr> nFFF: jQuery(document).ready(function ($) { $("#datepicker").datepicker(); })(JQuery); results in 'JQuery is not defined' & 'Object #<Object> has no method 'datepicker''

[12:33:35] <nFFF> use jsfiddle
[12:33:39] <nFFF> and Ill help

[12:33:43] <bot-t> jsFiddle (http://jsfiddle.net) is an online IDE for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is the best way to provide test cases of your jQuery bugs (for support and the bug tracker).

[12:34:02] <codepal> jsfiddle for a userscript?
[12:34:02] <nFFF> what is datepicker?
[12:34:25] <codepal> I'm gonna have to paste the whole site code in there, this is gonna get messy
[12:34:31] <nFFF> codepal, dont post the whole site
[12:34:39] <nFFF> just post a minimal test case
[12:34:44] <nFFF> to recreate your error
[12:35:25] <codepal> ok, give me an hour to recreate
[12:35:26] <nFFF> john_doe_jr, your issue is there is no such thing as datepicker, is it a plugin? if so it's not being included by the browser, at least not before you run that code
[12:35:33] <codepal> I'm noob & slow
[12:35:34] <nFFF> an hour? you work slow :>
[12:36:07] <john_doe_jr> nFFF: http://jqueryui.com/demos/datepicker/
[12:38:01] <nFFF> Ok so see my last comment
[12:38:04] <nFFF> ?datepicker
[12:38:05] <bot-t> nFFF, UI/API/1.8/Datepicker - The jQuery UI Datepicker is a highly configurable plugin that adds datepicker functionality to your pages. You can customize the date format and language, restrict the selectable date ranges and ad... http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Datepicker
[12:38:29] <nFFF> You need to include the plugin beofre you try to access one of its methods
[12:38:46] <john_doe_jr> nFFF: how would I include a plug in?
[12:40:52] <nFFF> john_doe_jr you download it and include it just like you do jQuery
[12:41:00] <nFFF> or find a URL that has it hosted already
[12:41:15] <nFFF> You should perhaps read a little basic things before trying to right code
[12:41:23] <nFFF> in the long run it will definately make things easier
[12:42:04] <john_doe_jr> nFFF: well, I'm using Drupal and I thought that JQuery was automatically included
[12:42:44] <arvidkahl> sure, but not the standalone plugins
[12:42:54] <arvidkahl> they need to be.. plugged in...
[12:46:35] <Edler> hey guys
[12:46:41] <Edler> i want to animate color and backgroundColor
[12:46:50] <Edler> i tried to google it but found zillions of different results
[12:46:57] <Edler> i want your recommendations, what do i use ?
[12:47:04] <Edler> i want it to work on all major browsers
[12:47:37] <koltroll> I'd appreciate some pointers in the right direction here; I want to trigger one event when mousemove on a element (body) and another event 5seconds -after- the mouse has stopped moving over the same element. It's the second part I'm abit clueless about.
[12:47:40] <JackBauer24> Edler: I think this should work - http://api.jquery.com/animate/
[12:48:16] <Edler> JackBauer24: most properties that are non-numeric cannot be animated using basic jQuery functionality (For example, width, height, or left can be animated but background-color cannot be...
[12:49:55] <spiffie> ...unless
[12:50:35] <JackBauer24> Edler: then use SwitchClass which is part of jQuery UI
[12:50:41] <JackBauer24> that one changes background color for sure
[12:50:44] <Edler> ah kk
[12:50:44] <Edler> thx
[12:52:38] <evilgeenius> So the CDN http://cdn.jquerytools.org is down.   I wonder how many people that will screw over, including me.
[12:55:38] <sroy2> Hi, I am trying to store information as a json file to be parsed into a html table. Does anyone have any advice for good formatting on how to store the data? (or better yet a plugin that does the parsing if the json is formatted a specific way?)
[12:57:46] <codepal> nFFF, what's the equiv -- $(document).on( in jsfiddle?
[12:58:03] <codepal> cause my original on click call doesn't even work in it...
[12:58:46] <evilgeenius> Does anyone have a copy of jquery.tools.min.js v 1.2.5 that I could have?
[12:58:56] <JackBauer24> codepal: .ready(
[12:59:20] <nFFF> codepal you dont need it
[12:59:29] <nFFF> on the left select on domready from the drop down
[13:00:30] <codepal> http://jsfiddle.net/palhmbs/8Y3v6/2/
[13:00:35] <codepal> as far as I got
[13:00:56] <codepal> but it's not working, quite
[13:01:49] <Eviltwin> You probably would want newScript.addEventListener('load'
[13:02:17] <Eviltwin> $(document).ready.on('click', "a.hide", ...) ?
[13:02:27] <Eviltwin> What is that supposed to do?
[13:04:35] <codepal> newScript addEventListener isn't required... I'm not appending jquery to the page..
[13:04:45] <codepal> it should already be loaded right ;-)
[13:05:08] <codepal> and $(document).on('click', was what I originally was using
[13:05:23] <codepal> which works fine, just not in jsfiddle
[13:07:40] <codepal> $(document) wraps the whole page in jquery, then finds all a.hide elements clickable - afaik
[13:09:44] <codepal> then the function checks whether the sidebar is :visible / display: none / block and does what its told tod
[13:09:55] <codepal> s/tod/to do/
[13:30:03] <Uncle_Mother> anybody here familiar with win2k3?
[13:30:20] <john_doe_jr> arvidkahl: do I have any ideas why I wouldn't be able to add several date pickers on a page?
[13:30:32] <kingnebula> Uncle_Mother, o_O
[13:30:47] <Uncle_Mother> hm
[13:30:48] <Uncle_Mother> you're right
[13:36:52] <theBrettman> how do I pass an arg with a callback that's in object form?
[13:37:03] <theBrettman> like normally, you call the function without parenthesis
[13:37:11] <theBrettman> so how do you pass an arg with it then?
[13:37:24] <mansoor> callBackfunction(argsssssss)
[13:37:28] <mansoor> ?
[13:37:29] <theBrettman> nope
[13:37:33] <mansoor> ohhh
[13:37:36] <theBrettman> I get unexpected token
[13:37:46] <mansoor>   function foo() {}    bar(foo);
[13:37:53] <mansoor> you just pass it by name
[13:38:13] <theBrettman> it's saying unexpected token (
[13:38:45] <theBrettman> I'm trying to pass myfunction($(this));
[13:38:47] <mansoor> theBrettman, pastie yoru code
[13:39:03] <mansoor> $(this)   is a jquery instance
[13:39:09] <theBrettman> right
[13:39:24] <theBrettman> so I have to pass this instead?
[13:39:59] <theBrettman> nope, it's not that either
[13:40:02] <theBrettman> still get the same error
[13:40:20] <theBrettman> no matter what I put in the parenthesis or even if I leave them empty
[13:40:36] <mansoor> :S i dont' get it
[13:41:02] <mansoor> pastie me an example of what you are doing please
[13:41:19] <theBrettman> say like you got options: {callback}
[13:41:29] <theBrettman> if u put parenthesis on a callback like that, u get an error
[13:41:40] <theBrettman> that is the example
[13:42:11] <diverdude> is it bad practice to do $('body').append(someobj); from inside a jquery module?
[13:42:11] <theBrettman> like if you're using jquery-ui stuff
[13:42:12] <Vorspire> I don't see any parenthesis in that example
[13:42:18] <theBrettman> or if ur using $.post
[13:42:27] <theBrettman> that's cuz I left them out
[13:42:30] <spiffie> how are you defining your callback function?
[13:42:34] <theBrettman> if u did callback() instead
[13:42:39] <theBrettman> it would return an error
[13:42:51] <mansoor> theBrettman, hard to ffollow what you are saying :p  can you make a quick pastie?
[13:43:13] <Vorspire> it wouldn't return an error, it would't compile, it would be invalid syntax
[13:43:16] <theBrettman> I'm using dialog and on the ok: button, I want a callback with an arg
[13:44:22] <theBrettman> hold on then, I will pastie
[13:45:04] <diverdude> any1?
[13:48:09] <theBrettman> http://pastie.org/3458680
[13:48:38] <theBrettman> now do you understand what I'm asking?
[13:49:33] <theBrettman> when I try to put parenthesis on the callback, it says unexpected token (
[13:49:52] <john_doe_jr> How do I make a date picker default to a certain date? function(){ $(".datepicker").datepicker();
[13:50:21] <theBrettman> read the manual for the options
[13:50:21] <cobexer_> ok: {
[13:50:22] <cobexer_>             callback(arg);
[13:50:24] <cobexer_>         }
[13:50:49] <theBrettman> it don't work. it says unexpected token (
[13:50:56] <cobexer_> theBrettman: and replace that with: ok: function() { callback(arg); }
[13:51:00] <drixie> hello
[13:51:05] <theBrettman> ok
[13:51:24] <drixie> I have a question about colour manipulation. Might sound a bit  outside of jQuery
[13:51:37] <cobexer_> sry for the paste btw, somehow i'm not allowed to paste into that input without directly sending the text =/
[13:52:01] <drixie> If I have color A, how do I calculate the amout of hue, saturation, and lightness required to transform it to colour B

[13:54:45] <JavaLover> so i have this function that is removing scrollbars from my browser
[13:54:48] <JavaLover> it's fine i love it
[13:54:53] <JavaLover> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3656592/programmatically-disable-scrolling

[13:55:14] <JavaLover> i'd like the scrollbar to still be there just that you can't use it
[13:57:08] <ecksit> Can someone help me out with this error? http://pastesite.com/32078 . Error is "Uncaught TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'split' "
[13:57:55] <cobexer_> ecksit: ftp_domain_field = $('#ftp_domain').val(); maybe?
[13:58:08] <ecksit> I tried that as well as .text()
[13:59:07] <ecksit> Ah, my mistake. It requires parenthese.
[13:59:34] <cobexer_> ecksit: also line 11 is wrong
[14:00:20] <cobexer_> ecksit: should be like:  $('#ftp_domain').val(ftp_domain_array[0] + '_' + ftp_domain_array[1]);
[14:00:40] <ecksit> Ah, so don't use assignment operators?
[14:01:03] <cobexer_> ecksit: JavaScript isn't C++ ;)
[14:01:44] <ecksit> Hmm, the blur stuill doesn't work. :(
[14:01:51] <ecksit> onblur*
[14:02:37] <cobexer_> ecksit: there is no blur in $PASTE
[14:04:39] <ecksit> Updated - http://pastesite.com/32080
[14:06:18] <ecksit> Also missed some }); at the end
[14:06:44] <cobexer_> ecksit: http://pastesite.com/32082 should work i also renamed some vars to make it clear which of them contain jQuery sets makes it easier to track whats in them ;)
[14:07:25] <john_doe_jr> does anyone know if there is a way to default a data picker on load?
[14:09:22] <cobexer_> john_doe_jr: does this: http://jqueryui.com/demos/datepicker/#option-defaultDate not help?
[14:09:54] <ecksit> Hmm, still not working. :(
[14:13:02] <john_doe_jr> cobexer: right, but I'd like the page to load with text in the input box with a default date though
[14:13:24] <cobexer> john_doe_jr: afair that should work too
[14:13:55] <john_doe_jr> cobexer: "afair that should work too"?
[14:14:43] <cobexer> as far as i remember the datepicker should read the date from the input on initialization maybe your default date format is wrong?
[14:16:29] <john_doe_jr> cobexer: alright ...let me see
[14:17:12] <Es0teric> why is it that if i define a placeholder in the .hover() i cant use it on the mouseout?
[14:17:20] <Es0teric> its still in the same scope...
[14:18:34] <john_doe_jr> cobexer: do you know where I can determine the actually parameters that the .datapicker() accepts?
[14:19:58] <black_warlock> inside the script
[14:20:11] <black_warlock> or you can make a script apart
[14:20:15] <black_warlock> with all settings
[14:21:02] <black_warlock> who can give an hand with this script
[14:21:07] <black_warlock> http://jsfiddle.net/jonny/KjJc4/34/
[14:21:18] <black_warlock> why the '+' wont become '-' ?
[14:22:12] <black_warlock> jesus
[14:22:19] <black_warlock> i did it lo
[14:22:20] <black_warlock> lol
[14:22:35] <black_warlock> why the hell i put the last code after return false i dunno
[14:23:00] <cobexer> john_doe_jr: hmm in the docs maybe? ^^
[14:25:57] <john_doe_jr> Alright the following doesn't work....any ideas what would work?$(".datepicker").datepicker("option", dateFormat: \'dd/mm/yyyy\', defaultDate: \'15/11/2010\',);
[14:27:12] <cobexer> john_doe_jr: the code you posted is't valid javascript
[14:27:48] <john_doe_jr> cobexer: it not complete javascript...I'm just telling you that the options passing to .datepicker aren't working
[14:31:51] <diverdude> How do i access the element a plugin has been attached to from inside the plugin?
[14:32:21] <cobexer> john_doe_jr: you don't set options on initialization the way you posted it tough, it would be easier if there was real javascript code to talk about
[14:33:27] <black_warlock> who can tell me how can i close other divs if one is opened ?
[14:33:55] <diverdude> black_warlock: whaaaat?
[14:33:56] <black_warlock> opened 1 by one
[14:33:59] <black_warlock> http://jsfiddle.net/jonny/KjJc4/36/
[14:34:16] <john_doe_jr> cobexer: so I should just use javascript
[14:34:27] <black_warlock> if i click one div all the others opened closes
[14:34:52] <diverdude> black_warlock: not here
[14:35:09] <diverdude> black_warlock: if i press intranet only intranet opens
[14:35:22] <black_warlock> yes but
[14:35:29] <black_warlock> if you click one by one they all opens
[14:35:48] <diverdude> black_warlock: sure thats what you have instructed in your code so that is expected
[14:35:51] <black_warlock> instead when you click new one all the others opened gonna be closed
[14:36:33] <diverdude> black_warlock: just loop all boxes and close each one except the one you want open
[14:36:50] <diverdude> black_warlock: use $.each(arr,handler)
[14:37:15] <diverdude> black_warlock: alternively use a css selector
[14:37:15] <cobexer> john_doe_jr: make a paste somewhere or point me to some test page so i can see the real javascript and fiddle around with it
[14:37:45] <Es0teric> if i set a variable on .hover() in the mousein, how do i make that same variable with the same value set in mousein available on mouseout?
[14:37:47] <black_warlock> hum dunno
[14:37:54] <diverdude> black_warlock: make them all implement ctrl class and do $(".ctrlclass").closefunction()
[14:38:19] <diverdude> black_warlock: loads of options...just pick one and get the job done ;)
[14:38:54] <black_warlock> i dont understand ya
[14:39:12] <movvy> so
[14:39:26] <movvy> I have a notice... after i create something it redirects and leave a notice it was created
[14:39:39] <movvy> im looking for some nice plugin that will only shot this notice for say 5 seconds
[14:39:41] <movvy> then go away
[14:39:57] <diverdude> black_warlock: what dont you understand
[14:40:42] <diverdude> movvy: use .delay( duration [, queueName] )
[14:40:59] <prodn_> black_warlock: http://jsfiddle.net/KjJc4/37/
[14:40:59] <movvy> on a div or something?
[14:41:24] <prodn_> black_warlock: is this what you meant? (check last msg from me)
[14:41:30] <diverdude> movvy: http://api.jquery.com/delay/
[14:41:46] <black_warlock> ahuauhauh
[14:41:55] <black_warlock> looks like a luna park
[14:41:57] <black_warlock> http://jsfiddle.net/jonny/KjJc4/39/
[14:42:33] <prodn_> black_warlock: http://jsfiddle.net/KjJc4/37/ did you get that?
[14:43:43] <prodn_> black_warlock: response?
[14:44:31] <black_warlock> i saw your
[14:44:38] <black_warlock> but its terrible effect
[14:44:43] <prodn_> why is that?
[14:44:56] <prodn_> when you open one, all other closes
[14:44:58] <black_warlock> it close the opened div too fastly
[14:45:06] <prodn_> aha, ok, sorry, wait
[14:45:20] <diverdude> black_warlock: insert delay? Insert animation?
[14:45:27] <black_warlock> iits like it get cutted
[14:45:45] <black_warlock> i've tried
[14:45:53] <black_warlock> but doesnt work with his script
[14:45:58] <black_warlock> toggle(false)
[14:47:38] <xarxer> To simulate image transition from greyscale to color, should I use two images (one grey and one color) and then just fade-in the colored one?
[14:49:25] <black_warlock> hum
[14:49:29] <diverdude> xarxer: that would be an easy way to do it yes
[14:49:32] <black_warlock> that script fuck up all the rest
[14:49:55] <black_warlock> the + and - on the button doesnt work fine
[14:50:09] <black_warlock> its unnatural closure that one
[14:50:11] <xarxer> diverdude: Okay :)
[14:50:38] <xarxer> Correct me if I'm wrong, but I should not fade-out the grey one, right?
[14:51:12] <diverdude> xarxer: it should have more or less similar effect
[14:51:32] <diverdude> xarxer: try both and see what you like
[14:51:38] <xarxer> diverdude: Ok, thanks :)
[14:51:58] <diverdude> xarxer: no worries
[14:53:25] <black_warlock> prodn_
[14:53:36] <black_warlock> prodn_ got it done
[14:53:40] <black_warlock> thanks

[14:56:47] <black_warlock> ^_^
[14:57:10] <prodn_> never used toggle before. I wanted to add a class to each one that was toggled
[14:57:21] <prodn_> so I also had to use toggleClass, which I also never used :)
[14:57:44] <prodn_> but it worked out fine. Your's was simpler though, I did not know toggle toggled between show and hide :)

[15:03:45] <Shazer[2]> Hello :)
[15:03:57] <Shazer[2]> What's up ajpiano?
[15:05:22] <Pnoexz> hey, im getting this json from ajax, {"success":false,"error":["nombre","apellido","documento"]}.. i can access data.success with no problem, but how would i access one of the elements in the error object?
[15:06:17] <cobexer> Pnoexz: data.error[0]
[15:06:31] <cobexer> Pnoexz: it's a normal array
[15:06:57] <Pnoexz> cobexer: i see, is there any way to get it with the value? like data.error.nombre or data.error['nombre']?
[15:08:09] <Pnoexz> (i can change it server-side too)
[15:08:31] <black_warlock> guys how it was to togle down vertically ?
[15:09:19] <black_warlock> .slideDown ?
[15:10:07] <innociv> phoexz i think you want to be returning "error":{"nombre":1, "documento":"foo"}
[15:11:21] <Pnoexz> innociv: yes! thanks, i just got it
[15:11:43] <Pnoexz> cobexer: thanks for your help too
[15:11:46] <Pnoexz> innociv++
[15:11:56] <Pnoexz> no karma here either, thats too bad
[15:12:02] <innociv> It's k
[15:15:24] <Pnoexz> if anybody cares, from the server side just had to array_flip it, and then from JS check if (typeof data.error.nombre != 'undefined') { /* this is wrong */ } (because only errors are sent, valid fields are unset/undefined from the server-side)
[15:15:48] <Shazer[2]> Pnoexz: what're you making?
[15:16:36] <Pnoexz> Shazer[2]: when user fills a form, show all the invalid fields instead of a general "check all your input" message
[15:17:05] <Shazer[2]> Ah ok
[15:17:12] <Shazer[2]> I'm stumped, I'm not sure what to make.
[15:17:20] <Shazer[2]> I want to make something simple, but fun.
[15:17:28] <Shazer[2]> That people will use, the design doesn't have to be magnificient.
[15:17:33] <Shazer[2]> Hey, look how Facebook started.
[15:17:49] <imsky> wat
[15:18:10] <Pnoexz> Shazer[2]: make a puzzle script, like those 4x4 sqares with only 15 pieces, and you have to move pieces to the empty space to move them
[15:18:33] <Shazer[2]> Nah, I'm not looking into making a game, Pnoexz. Thanks anyway.
[15:18:37] <Shazer[2]> All the original ideas are taken. :(
[15:19:33] <prodn_> Shazer[2]: to-do lists. Everyone can share tasks
[15:19:36] <Pnoexz> Shazer[2]: most fun i had with JS was with grids, thats why i suggested that.
[15:19:47] <Shazer[2]> prodn_, now that's a good idea.
[15:20:04] <Shazer[2]> Do you guys usually plan stuff before you make it?
[15:20:10] <Shazer[2]> And if so, what's the process?
[15:20:11] <prodn_> Shazer[2]: no :)
[15:20:21] <gazzwi86> hey all
[15:20:54] <gazzwi86> I'm using jquery ui sortable lists and trying to serialise my data, but with alphanumeric ids its splitting the id
[15:20:56] <prodn_> Shazer[2]: make the list to be able to communicate with other services, such as facebook, to get audience, and for single-sign on
[15:21:02] <gazzwi86> any reason as to why?
[15:21:15] <Shazer[2]> prodn_, elaborate.
[15:21:20] <hays> anyone have any idea why my drop shadows might not be working (menus) ? using superfish http://www.stevehayphotography.com/sadie/articles.html
[15:21:25] <Shazer[2]> Dabbling in the Facebook API is something I've wanted to do.
[15:21:49] <prodn_> Shazer[2]: "login with facebook". You should be able to upload your list with an easy <embed> tag, just like youtube
[15:22:03] <Shazer[2]> prodn_, I've never used Facebook to communicate with any of my sites.
[15:22:14] <prodn_> Shazer[2]: they have guides, it's really easy
[15:22:16] <Shazer[2]> I should probably try get a simple login with Facebook established first.
[15:22:33] <prodn_> Shazer[2]: don't care about facebook for now, but in the end
[15:22:55] <Vorspire> (Shazer[2]): try finish this off :P http://jsfiddle.net/Vorspire/JmKM4/
[15:23:02] <prodn_> Shazer[2]: just make logins for users, then listmaking functionalities, then list-items that depends on each other or somewhat. Also so that users can share lists or list items
[15:23:47] <prodn_> Shazer[2]: say two classmates from shcool are gonna do their homework, then they can easily share the task with eahch other. Sort of setting up a meeting, if you look at MS outlook or whatever
[15:24:11] <black_warlock> now its complete
[15:24:18] <black_warlock> check it now
[15:24:20] <black_warlock> http://jsfiddle.net/jonny/KjJc4/46/
[15:24:26] <black_warlock> this is perfect
[15:24:44] <black_warlock> =)
[15:24:48] <Shazer[2]> prodn_, hmm.
[15:24:51] <Shazer[2]> I think I get the idea.
[15:24:53] <black_warlock> im walking with my feet !
[15:25:23] <prodn_> Shazer[2]: I think this is the best I can bring out from myself right now. I've also looked into it, there is nothing like it yet. It could be the next big thing
[15:25:50] <prodn_> Shazer[2]:, well I found one site though, "remember the milk" or whatever, but they lack huge functionalities
[15:26:04] <Shazer[2]> prodn_, I can only try.
[15:26:06] <Shazer[2]> So they share work, or?
[15:26:52] <prodn_> Shazer[2]: remember that a TODO-list should be easy, and you should make it work on all devices, such as smartphones
[15:27:14] <Shazer[2]> prodn_, I'll just work on web functionality for now.
[15:27:22] <prodn_> Shazer[2]: you can check items when they are done, and you can see your TODO history
[15:27:28] <Shazer[2]> So is it just a TODO list, or is it like whole documents they share?
[15:27:32] <prodn_> Shazer[2]: ofc. Start somewhere, make a roadmap if you want to
[15:28:23] <prodn_> Shazer[2]: It could be a simple list. But when the user clicks on a list-item, you can see more details
[15:28:28] <Shazer[2]> Ah ok
[15:28:29] <Shazer[2]> :)
[15:28:36] <Shazer[2]> I want a good design, not a shit one that doesn't attract users.
[15:29:19] <prodn_> Shazer[2]: first things first. Start easy. Make a list of ideas and pick some of them to start with. Then continue with releases, picking new ideas from that list.
[15:29:46] <Shazer[2]> prodn_, will do.
[15:29:46] <prodn_> Shazer[2]: good design: you should look into "responsive design". That is - make it mobile user friendly
[15:29:49] <Shazer[2]> How long will you be on for?
[15:29:56] <Shazer[2]> I'll keep you updated.
[15:30:01] <Shazer[2]> I usually get the foundations done pretty quickly.
[15:30:01] <sroy2> hi, I'm trying to parse json and I want to be able to differentiate between objects {} and arrays []… I thought if (typeof item === 'object') would do the trick but both objects and arrays are returning true.
[15:30:06] <Es0teric> in .hover() how do i pass a variable value from mousein to mouseout?
[15:30:28] <prodn_> Shazer[2]: You can make private msg to me, I am always online, but only checks in every once in a while
[15:30:37] <Shazer[2]> Alright prodn_.
[15:30:38] <Shazer[2]> :)
[15:30:43] <prodn_> :)
[15:30:46] <Shazer[2]> I need a suitable name.
[15:30:47] <Shazer[2]> :)
[15:31:06] <prodn_> Shazer[2]: think about the word "TODO" and what it means to make lists
[15:31:12] <prodn_> Shazer[2]: I need to go now. Drop the name for now :)
[15:31:15] <prodn_> Shazer[2]: bye
[15:31:22] <Shazer[2]> Cya prodn_.
[15:34:53] <gazzwi86> query serialise is stripping special characters like - is there a way around this?
[15:35:11] <gazzwi86> im passing youtube id's and need to use special characters as a result?
[15:38:26] <mansoor> gazzwi86, yes, dont' serialize
[15:38:32] <mansoor> just put them there yourself
[15:39:06] <muzone> mansoor?
[15:39:20] <muzone> from kuwait?
[15:39:50] <mansoor> no
[15:39:59] <mansoor> Afghanistan
[15:40:00] <muzone> sorry
[15:40:15] <muzone> thought you were this other dud
[15:40:18] <muzone> * dude
[15:40:20] <mansoor> heh np
[15:40:21] <standoo> hi
[15:40:25] <mansoor> hi
[15:40:33] <standoo> i'm going to create a jsfiddle clone using jquery
[15:41:27] <Shazer[2]> Nice standoo.
[15:42:08] <standoo> what features would you like?
[15:42:16] <mansoor> standoo, if you need a freelance developer let me know :D
[15:42:44] <standoo> mansoor: haha, sure
[15:43:04] <sroy2> zoo… any advice differentiating between json arrays and json objects: http://jsfiddle.net/uXww2/35/
[15:43:56] <mansoor> sroy2, one way to do it would be to turn it into an object using JSON.parse()  and using  instanceof Array
[15:44:02] <mansoor> to test if its an array
[15:44:39] <sroy2> I'll see if working that way works out, thanks!
[15:44:45] <mansoor> and what that  "data" variable is holding, it isnt' valid JSON
[15:45:04] <mansoor> JSON data needs to be enclosed in either {} or []
[15:45:06] * muzone is now playing: Muzone - Seyoum (http://home.no/mritz/seyoum.mp3)
[15:45:13] <mansoor> unless i'm wrong <_<
[15:45:17] <mansoor> which happens every now and again
[15:45:31] <sroy2> jsonlint.com begs to differ
[15:45:34] <mansoor> lol this is one of them
[15:46:09] <mansoor> sorry i thought that was a string
[15:46:57] <sroy2> is array does do the job for me though, thanks!
[15:49:17] <gazzwi86> can anyone tel me what I'm ding wrong here - http://pastebin.com/DJEhGstf
[15:49:38] <ravenzz> it is not php man _;)
[15:49:47] <ravenzz> use literal arrays
[15:49:49] <gazzwi86> I'm getting unexpected token
[15:49:52] <ravenzz> var order = [];
[15:50:20] <ravenzz> and then omit the var
[15:50:56] <ravenzz> http://pastie.org/3459478
[15:52:15] <gazzwi86> ravenzz: excellent! Thank you!
[15:52:25] <gazzwi86> ben a while since I've played with Javascript
[15:53:05] <ravenzz> var order[index] will instanciate a new array at any itaration
[15:56:00] <adac> I have a div: https://gist.github.com/1911735 how do i read out its content in a jquery array?
[15:56:33] <ravenzz> ?text @ adac
[15:56:34] <bot-t> adac, .text(): Get the combined text contents of each element in the set of matched elements, including their descendants. http://api.jquery.com/text/
[15:56:38] <ravenzz> ?html @ adac
[15:56:38] <bot-t> adac, .html(): Get the HTML contents of the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/html/
[15:57:34] <adac> ravenzz, hmm but there is no way to put this "directly" into an array?
[15:58:54] <sam113101> ?parseJSON @ adac
[15:58:55] <bot-t> adac, jQuery.parseJSON(json): Takes a well-formed JSON string and returns the resulting JavaScript object. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.parseJSON/
[16:00:52] <adac> sam113101, and this "well-formend JSON String" can also be a divs html content, right?
[16:01:26] <sam113101> if the div contains correct JSON, yes
[16:06:31] <adac> sam113101, I guess my array is not well formed then
[16:07:11] <adac> sam113101, even though ruby on rails offers a to_json function for objects, so it should be actually a well formed one
[16:08:19] <danzik17> adac: why are you even storing this in a div?
[16:09:29] <sroy2> mansoor:  any advice on how to get the text of the key, or why the recursive call isn't splitting the links apart? http://jsfiddle.net/uXww2/36/
[16:12:34] <adac> danzik17, well because i'm not really sure how to solve it otherwise. I guess there is  way to render json via rails for sure. But my ajax request does already render a partial, and I'm not sure if i can render json stuff at the same time/ requeyt
[16:12:40] <adac> *request
[16:13:36] <sroy2> does anyone have any advice on how to get the text of the key, or why the recursive call isn't splitting the links apart? http://jsfiddle.net/uXww2/36/
[16:14:20] <tbws> http://pastie.org/3459593 is there any reason why the console.log call there would return a blank value?
[16:14:30] <tbws> the elements exist and are there
[16:14:36] <danzik17> adac: just render <script> var foo = to_json(whatever);</script> or however you do it in rails.
[16:14:38] <tbws> *and are static
[16:14:43] <tbws> im not updating them yet
[16:16:52] <adac> danzik17, ok I need to check that. I'm quite a noob as you might have noticed :) thank you

[16:25:45] <fotoflo> i have a quick question: i have a <id = "container"> and inside that I have <embed id = "embed", margin = "10px">  , then i have $("#container"),mouseover(function(){console.log("mousing over")});  ---   when  I mouseover the area $.mouseover() gets fired twice, first when i mouse over the container part of the div, and then when i mouseover the embed part of the div.   How do i stop the second firing?
[16:26:13] <imsky> abjorn ABJORN
[16:26:19] <imsky> i lost a flash drive, looking all over for it
[16:26:37] <abjorn> well damn
[16:26:42] <imsky> i know right
[16:26:48] <imsky> i'm looking into buying its replacement
[16:26:57] <imsky> the replacement is the size of a dime
[16:27:13] <imsky> i think that might be the wrong thing to buy
[16:28:23] <dabear> fotoflo: look at mouseenter and mouseleave instead
[16:29:35] <fotoflo> dabear: great, that fixes it. thanks!
[16:31:10] <sroy2> Hi, I have a $.each(obj, function(k,v){ … } loop and I want to print the "text" of the k, but I always end up printing the numeric value of the key… any advice on how to get a string back instead of a number?
[16:33:34] <fotoflo> sroy what variable do you end up printing?
[16:34:33] <sroy2> http://jsfiddle.net/uXww2/37/ -- second info box prints 1, I want "Browsers"
[16:34:37] <fotoflo> try this :   $.each(obj, function(k,v){ console.log(this, k, v); }
[16:34:40] <fotoflo> btw
[16:39:18] <fotoflo> sroy: http://jsfiddle.net/uXww2/38/
[16:39:32] <fotoflo> try opening this with the firebug console running
[16:39:48] <fotoflo> I'm not sure what you want, but I'm pretty sure you can get there.
[16:42:10] <sroy2> well, this.key would work if that was valid js...
[16:43:34] <sroy2> … I want to get the word "Browsers" back… *sigh*
[16:44:59] <sroy2> I have both this and v = { "Browsers":["a","b"]} and I want to get the key name out of it… "Browsers"
[16:45:16] <fotoflo> keys(v)
[16:45:45] <fotoflo> keys is a standard function ;-)
[16:46:14] <fotoflo> keys(this) also works
[16:47:10] <sroy2> that seems to break the loop … not sure why...
[16:47:27] <sroy2> http://jsfiddle.net/uXww2/39/
[16:49:31] <fotoflo> wierd
[16:49:36] <fotoflo> the debugger says keys is not defined
[16:52:46] <fotoflo> however when you run keys() in the debugger it works
[16:52:47] <fotoflo> wtf
[16:53:06] * fotoflo is not a js expert ;-/
[16:54:24] <fotoflo> Object.keys(this)
[16:54:26] <fotoflo> ....
[16:55:22] <sroy2> that appears to work :)
[17:04:10] <adac> if this is my div: <img id="fetched-page-picture" src="/assets/webpage_images/h6H07lIaSwzf2BAdnuoB7EvRC-4/0.JPEG" alt="0"> how do I get out the src?
[17:05:55] <fotoflo> what do you want to do with it?
[17:06:39] <fotoflo> $("#fetched-page-pictur").attr('src')
[17:07:29] <adac> fotoflo, basically I have an array where I'd like to search for this path "h6H07lIaSwzf2BAdnuoB7EvRC-4/0.JPEG" and then do an ajax request with the next element (the next path) in this array
[17:08:10] <fotoflo> $("#fetched-page-pictur"e).attr('src')
[17:08:16] <fotoflo> that will get you the src
[17:08:38] <fotoflo> …well, if you spell the id right ;-)
[17:09:15] <adac> :)
[17:09:17] <adac> thank you
[17:10:12] <fotoflo> np
[17:17:02] <Shazer[2]> God damnit.
[17:17:14] <Shazer[2]> Just spent an hour trying to figure out why my script wasn't setting session variables.
[17:17:15] <Shazer[2]> -.-
[17:17:24] <Shazer[2]> To find I forgot to put session_start..
[17:24:47] <diverdude> Shazer[2]: and what does that have to do with jquery?
[17:24:56] <Shazer[2]> diverdude, nothing.
[17:24:58] <Shazer[2]> Didn't say it did.
[17:24:59] <Shazer[2]> :)
[17:25:09] <Shazer[2]> I would've said it at #php, but I'm banned for a reason I'm unsure of.
[17:25:31] <diverdude> lol
[17:25:47] <Shazer[2]> :P
[17:25:53] <Shazer[2]> I won't talk about PHP anymore though
[17:25:53] <Shazer[2]> :P
[17:25:59] <diverdude> maybe for posting irrellevant stuff?
[17:26:03] <Shazer[2]> Probably lol
[17:26:11] <Shazer[2]> Nah I don't know, I probably got pissed off at an op then got owned
[17:26:36] <sroy2> Does anyone know what is throwing the "can't convert JS argument arg 0 [nsIDOMDocFrag.appendChild] error on this: http://jsfiddle.net/uXww2/43/
[17:32:41] <tomasm-> anyone here have recommendations for basic ajax history plugins? I have a dialog window that has distinct urls and all i want to do is have back button go back to the urls. it doesn't have to preserve anything complicated, just reload the urls in the list. the 'address' plugin seems a bit over my head and not well documented. are there easy alternatives?
[17:32:53] <adac> how to get an index of an array element?
[17:33:30] <tomasm-> arrayname.get(n) ?
[17:34:47] <diverdude> sroy2: i may have an idea
[17:35:26] <sroy2> diverdude:  I feel like its getting broke during the recursive call but I really don't know...
[17:36:18] <adac> tomasm-, hmm no that doesn't woork I do get: picArray.get is not a function
[17:36:58] <diverdude> sroy2: you have added: <a href="#Documents">Documents</a> and you are trying to access $("<a>",{href:"#"+v}). So basically you are actually trying to create a new element while trying to append to it
[17:37:28] <diverdude> sroy2: i think you want to access the already existing <a href="#Documents">Documents</a> right?
[17:37:33] <diverdude> and append to that one
[17:38:03] <sroy2> diverdude:  so why does that work in the first menu function but not the second?
[17:38:44] <diverdude> hmm good question
[17:41:45] <diverdude> sroy2: i dont knwo
[17:41:49] <diverdude> sry
[17:42:04] <sroy2> yeah, don't worry about it - I'm stumped too.
[17:42:25] <diverdude> its probably some stupid little thing
[17:42:28] <diverdude> it always is
[17:47:59] <sroy2> hmmm interesting behavior when I substitute v[k] for v… It picks up the first value correctly but barfs on the last 2...
[17:51:57] <john_doe_jr> how do you get the value of the default input box in jquery?
[17:57:28] <Shazer[2]> How does draggable work?
[17:59:20] <Shazer[2]> How do i use it?
[17:59:21] <Shazer[2]> I*
[18:02:48] <diverdude> if i have a jquery container: var cw = $([]); and add some elements to this container, how do i then remove a specific element again from the container?
[18:09:32] <zackattack> how do i set the jqueryUI css include path?
[18:41:01] <mo0nykit> Hi, I want the "done" function of an ajax call to return something. How do I retrieve it?
[18:43:02] <tar_> mo0nykit: you'll have to call a function from the "done" handler with whatever information you want to 'return"
[18:43:57] <mo0nykit> tar_: I'll give it a shot
[18:47:08] <zackattack> anyone here have experience with the jqueryui.progressbar component?
[18:52:22] <mo0nykit> tar_: I'd like to get it out into the console, like rawdata = $.ajax(....)
[18:53:21] <tar_> … done: function(…) { console.log(the data); } ...
[18:55:57] <abjorn> COLDHEAD
[19:31:09] <someprimetime> so live() works to rebind my anchor text when loading content through ajax, but on() doesnt work
[19:31:22] <someprimetime> i thought on() was the better choice?
[19:31:27] <someprimetime> using jquery 1.7 btw
[19:34:06] <Eviltwin> someprimetime: .live doesn't do any "rebinding"
[19:34:16] <someprimetime> Eviltwin: nm
[19:34:17] <someprimetime> figured it out
[19:34:20] <Eviltwin> Ths is why .live's syntax is bad
[19:34:29] <someprimetime> yeah, i messed up the on() parameters
[19:34:34] <someprimetime>         $(document).on('click', 'a', direction, function() { works
[19:34:43] <someprimetime>         $(document).on('click', direction, function() {
[19:34:45] <someprimetime> is what i was doing
[19:35:14] <someprimetime> surprised you are here on a saturday night though
[19:40:37] <jtoy> how would I add a class around a word in a string ?  so if i have the string  "hello world"  I want to find world and change the string to "hello <div class='foo'>world</div>"
[19:44:48] <StevenCodes> jtoy:  subst
[19:45:16] <jtoy> StevenCodes: ok, i thought there might be some special query way, thx
[19:45:46] <StevenCodes> lol whats funny is I thought this was php room
[19:46:41] <tar_> haha
[19:48:52] <JJMalina> I included this code (http://stackoverflow.com/a/5107878/445954) in $.ajaxSetup to allow my csrf token to be used in ajax POST requests and now when I parse the JSON response from my ajax call I get "JSON.parse: unexpected character" error, anyone have an idea?
[19:54:55] <tar_> JJMalina: do you know what the response body looks like? is it still JSON?
[19:56:07] <JJMalina> tar_: yeah I checked and realized I didnt encode my data into json on the server side. derp.
[19:59:45] <jtoy> StevenCodes: haha
[19:59:53] <jtoy> i don't like php
[20:00:33] <StevenCodes> yeah my bad
[20:00:37] <StevenCodes> lol
[20:04:46] <SirSkidmore> Using jquery mobile, how can I save a standard text input area into a point on array?
[20:16:13] <Spinkzeit> Is it possible to use jQuery selector on data that has come from $.get ?
[20:20:24] <Spinkzeit> don't worry I worked it out :)
[20:23:33] <skyl> is there any way to position a div above a jquery mobile dialog page? z-index seems not to be the way
[20:33:47] <epistax> Hey there! I'm trying to center something in the browser window (a flexible width pop-up) but I've run into some trouble  when the client is zoomed in. The scrollTop() seems to be accurate but I can't figure out the height of the screen at the current zoom level.. Now I've already decided the whole thing isn't user friendly but I'm still curious how to do it. Any ideas?
[20:35:47] <epistax> The actual goal is to present a message to the user that fits in the theme of the website, such that I can be fairly sure the user will see it.
[21:07:16] <astkfour> i am having an issue with my script ->http://fixee.org/paste/x6kprkx/ i have a jquery ui slider  and its a range i am passing the range values into a countdown but my issue is once its reached zero the values from the slider go back to default and not what the user has selected. Any ideas?
[21:09:01] <Ukto> i am using jquery tabs, and have about 3 on the left hand side... is there a way to set the 3rd to basically float right?
[21:13:01] <coldhead> #tabs li:nth-child(2) {float:right}  maybe ?
[21:24:04] <Es0teric> this shit is giving me a headache...
[21:26:15] <Joe_S> what is?
[21:26:36] <Es0teric> Joe_S, i am trying to do something so simple
[21:26:57] <LekeFly> Is it possible to change the position of a div in the "source" code? :p
[21:26:58] <Es0teric> but when i use the .html() method, it erases the original that i am trying to replace on hover
[21:27:17] <Es0teric> but on hoverout, i want the original to come back
[21:29:19] <Joe_S> Es0teric: I think you will need to store the original content in a variable and then insert it on hoverOut
[21:29:37] <Joe_S> I can put together a simple http://jsfiddle.net/ example if you like
[21:29:43] <Es0teric> Joe_S, see… i created the var outside the hover
[21:30:20] <Es0teric> BUT for some reason
[21:30:53] <Joe_S> LekeFly: Are you wanting to make live edits to the code? As far as I know you can't edit the "View Source Code" code
[21:32:11] <LekeFly> Joe_S: say i got this <div class="1">1</div><div class="2">2</div> and i want to move 2 above 1.. is that possible? :p
[21:32:13] <wroathe> Why doesn't     $('form#article').append(function(index) {
[21:32:13] <wroathe>       return '<textarea class="block-' + index + '" name=""></textarea>';
[21:32:13] <wroathe>     });
[21:32:16] <wroathe> work?
[21:32:23] <wroathe> the index stays at 0
[21:32:33] <wroathe> so I get block-0 every time I append something
[21:33:03] <Es0teric> Joe_S -> http://jsfiddle.net/MbG5J/
[21:34:26] <wroathe> the desired effect is that I'd have 1..n textarea elements with block-1..n class attributes
[21:37:48] <Joe_S> LekeFly: You can do this by editing the code file itself but not the source code
[21:37:54] <wroathe> nvm stupid question
[21:38:01] <Joe_S> Es0teric: I will take a look at that jsfiddle now :)
[21:38:03] <LekeFly> Joe_S: i need to do it live :/
[21:39:12] <Joe_S> LekeFly: I don't that is possible, I will have a look after helping Es0teric :)
[21:39:20] <Es0teric> alright
[21:39:21] <Es0teric> thanks
[21:39:25] <Joe_S> *don't think
[21:39:28] <Joe_S> your welcome :)
[21:39:53] <LekeFly> Joe_S: i got it almost working now.. but it doesnt seem to update.. do i need to add .live or something? $(".etalage_zoom_area").appendTo(".product-shop");
[21:46:00] <Joe_S> LekeFly: What are you using to make the live changes? Chrome inspector, Firebug or something else?
[21:46:45] <LekeFly> Joe_S: http://www.iphoneutstyr.no/untitled/kategori2/cops-turtleneck-tunic-2.html check of the slider after the buttons
[21:47:37] <LekeFly> im trying to move the .etalage_zoom_area .. dont know if it will work tho :p
[21:50:49] <LekeFly> Joe_S: Seems unlikely that it would work or? :p
[21:53:10] <yamahaalex37> does jquery have ajax built in
[21:53:39] <Es0teric> yamahaalex37 - YES
[21:53:48] <Joe_S> LekeFly: Apologies for the delay I will take a look at this when I have finshed Es0terics code
[21:53:48] <yamahaalex37> ok i was following a tut
[21:53:52] <yamahaalex37> and so I dont need request.js
[21:53:54] <yamahaalex37> i can just use jquery?
[21:54:15] <yamahaalex37> i need a dropdown that appends a css sheet
[21:55:09] <Es0teric> you can use $.ajax(); yamahaalex37
[21:55:23] <yamahaalex37> ok thanks Es0teric
[21:55:37] <mehrdad> does anyone know how to bind to a non-jquery event from jquery?
[21:55:57] <systemfault> What is a non-jquery event?
[21:56:02] <lekefly_> Joe_S: crashed..
[21:56:19] <mehrdad> simply a block not using jquery
[21:57:09] <mehrdad> systemfault, https://gist.github.com/1908800
[21:57:58] <mehrdad> this is not a jquery object thus i can't bind to its event
[21:58:17] <systemfault> mehrdad: Then make one I guess
[21:58:23] <systemfault> mehrdad: $(this).bind...
[21:58:37] <mehrdad> really?!
[21:58:48] <mehrdad> simple as that? gonna try it :)
[21:58:58] <bitbuzzer> What's a good tut on plugins?
[21:59:09] <systemfault> If "this" is a DOM node then yes, it's that easy
[21:59:17] <Joe_S> Es0teric ill pm you
[21:59:22] <yamahaalex37> is this an event listener?
[21:59:22] <yamahaalex37> $("#ComboBox option:selected").text()
[21:59:27] <systemfault> bitbuzzer: Start with looking at the authoring section in jquery's website.
[21:59:31] <Es0teric> alright, Joe_S
[21:59:35] <yamahaalex37> will that update on each change of selection?
[21:59:39] <Joe_S> LekeFly: what crashed?
[21:59:49] <yamahaalex37> nvm itsnot
[21:59:52] <lekefly_> Joe_S: my pc :p
[22:00:04] <lekefly_> Joe_S: So if you responed i didnt see it
[22:01:37] <Joe_S> Oh I see :P
[22:02:11] <Joe_S> I am still helping Es0teric I will look at your link asap
[22:13:07] <yamahaalex37> i thought there was a simple method to remove a CSS stylesheet
[22:16:11] <systemfault> yamahaalex37: Grab the link node and remove it?
[22:16:28] <yamahaalex37> systemfault, im not sure what you mean
[22:16:35] <systemfault> :/
[22:16:36] <yamahaalex37> by default I have red.css loaded
[22:16:46] <yamahaalex37> i need to remove red.css, and add white.css
[22:17:38] <yamahaalex37> can you please explain what you meant?
[22:17:39] <systemfault> $('link[href="red.css"]').remove() $('head').append('<link type="text/css" href="white.css">'); perhaps..
[22:17:46] <yamahaalex37> oh
[22:18:18] <systemfault> (I missed a rel attribute.. oh well)
[22:18:32] <yamahaalex37> can I php echo inside the href=" "
[22:19:30] <systemfault> :(
[22:20:12] <yamahaalex37> systemfault, this did not end up working
[22:20:19] <yamahaalex37> jQuery('link[href="http://url.tld/red.css"]').remove()
[22:21:30] <TNA-MichaelK> yamahaalex37: Yes, you can.
[22:21:46] <yamahaalex37> TNA-MichaelK, how should i change this:
[22:21:46] <yamahaalex37> jQuery('link[href="http://eternaware.com/joomla/themes/templates/gameframe/css/red.css"]').remove()
[22:21:48] <yamahaalex37> oops
[22:21:51] <systemfault> jQuery('link[href*="red.css"]').remove(): should work
[22:21:53] <yamahaalex37> well ya thats it
[22:22:01] <TNA-MichaelK> I was talking about the php echo
[22:22:06] <yamahaalex37> oh i can
[22:22:41] <yamahaalex37> dang
[22:22:44] <yamahaalex37> jQuery('link[href*="red.css"]').remove():
[22:22:46] <yamahaalex37> doesnt seem to be removing it either
[22:22:54] <TNA-MichaelK> <a href="<?php echo "link"; ?>">Click here!</a>
[22:24:05] <yamahaalex37> i cant figure out how to remove it :/
[22:24:27] <yamahaalex37> whats the opposite to this
[22:24:28] <yamahaalex37> $('head').append('<link rel="stylesheet"
[22:26:39] <theBrettman> how do I use .on() to tell when the a child node has been added?
[22:28:25] <yamahaalex37> god damn
[22:28:37] <yamahaalex37> too many bullsht quotes and confusing sht
[22:28:41] <theBrettman> I tried $('#parentID').on('createElement', function(){...});
[22:28:44] <yamahaalex37> jQuery('head').append('<link rel="stylesheet" href="'<?php echo $this->baseurl ?'/templates/'<?php echo $this->template ?>'/css/white.css"' type="text/css" />');
[22:28:57] <TNA-MichaelK> nonsense!
[22:29:00] <TNA-MichaelK> lol
[22:29:01] <systemfault> theBrettman: Doesn't make any sense... what do you want to do?
[22:29:01] <coldhead> yamahaalex37: $('head').append('<link id="something" ... and then $('#something').remove()
[22:29:14] <theBrettman> I wanna know when a child is added to an element
[22:29:24] <theBrettman> what event is fired?
[22:29:26] <yamahaalex37> coldhead, what is removing an #id going to get me
[22:29:29] <theBrettman> Idk what to listen for
[22:29:29] <TNA-MichaelK> $this->template;  forgot ;
[22:29:29] <yamahaalex37> im trying to remove a stylesheet
[22:29:57] <TNA-MichaelK> That's a weird way of doing things
[22:30:02] <TNA-MichaelK> I'd stay away from that
[22:30:18] <systemfault> theBrettman: Since YOU added the child... then you should know when it happened.
[22:30:39] <coldhead> oh sorry yamahaalex37 i thought you wanted to add a stylesheet and remove it later
[22:30:45] <coldhead> but you just want to remove it
[22:30:47] <yamahaalex37> i do coldhead
[22:30:47] <theBrettman> I know when but I wanna know the event listener...
[22:30:55] <yamahaalex37> no its true, i want to add and remove it
[22:31:05] <coldhead> if you give the stylesheet and ID then you can use that ID to remove it later
[22:31:09] <coldhead> an ID*
[22:31:14] <yamahaalex37> oh... didnt know style sheet could have ID
[22:31:15] <astkfour> i have a simple 30sec countdown clock whats the best way to show how many cycles its repeated? http://jsfiddle.net/p6KDj/
[22:31:24] <coldhead> everything can have an id :)
[22:31:25] <theBrettman> that's definitely an event, when something is added to the dom...
[22:31:35] <theBrettman> but what event?
[22:31:55] <theBrettman> I thought it was createElement but I guess that's a function
[22:32:06] <yamahaalex37> are you sure I can php in javascript
[22:32:12] <yamahaalex37> thought that was against the rules, needed ajax
[22:33:09] <theBrettman> is append an event?
[22:33:33] <systemfault> Nope.
[22:34:39] <TNA-MichaelK> yamahaalex37: you can put a <?php echo $a; ?> tag anywhere on your page so long as the url is  whatever.php as far as I know.
[22:34:58] <yamahaalex37> ok tanks
[22:42:40] <TheKaiser> hey, new to jq but eager to learn
[22:43:19] <TheKaiser> could anybody tell me pls how to scroll the $(window)?
[22:46:28] <coldhead> you need to use ?scrolltop
[22:46:28] <bot-t> .scrollTop(): Get the current vertical position of the scroll bar for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/scrollTop/
[22:46:35] <coldhead> and use ?animate
[22:46:35] <bot-t> .animate(properties, [duration], [easing], [complete]): Perform a custom animation of a set of CSS properties. http://api.jquery.com/animate/
[22:46:52] <TheKaiser> thanks!
[22:46:52] <coldhead> the scrolltop comments should have an example if you search for "animat"
[22:48:58] <TheKaiser> great, I'll show you my result in a bit
[22:49:04] <Es0teric> coldhead, on the .hover() when a global var is declared and you pass that into the .hover() method - how do you keep the original value before its changed?
[22:54:17] <coldhead> i don't understand Es0teric
[22:54:21] <coldhead> can you show me the code?
[22:54:33] <Es0teric> coldhead -> http://jsfiddle.net/MbG5J/
[22:55:20] <yamahaalex37> thanks coldhead TNA and systemfault , got it working
[22:55:47] <coldhead> good job yamahaalex37 !
[22:56:06] <coldhead> Es0teric: i'm not sure holder should be global
[22:56:15] <coldhead> i might not understand your code
[22:56:33] <coldhead> but if each element needs to save something on mousein and restore it on mouseout
[22:56:37] <coldhead> i would use data for that
[22:56:42] <coldhead> data()
[22:56:53] <Es0teric> data() IS in there, coldhead
[22:56:57] <coldhead> i know
[22:56:58] <coldhead> i see it
[22:57:02] <coldhead> that's why i'm confused
[22:57:06] <coldhead> why data AND a global
[22:57:36] <coldhead> let me fiddle you a slightly different method
[22:58:02] <Es0teric> alright
[23:00:16] <coldhead> Es0teric: http://jsfiddle.net/MbG5J/6/
[23:00:21] <coldhead> something like that
[23:00:32] <coldhead> that's probably buggy but i'm trying to explain the general idea
[23:00:38] <coldhead> i've had a few beers though >: |
[23:00:58] <Es0teric> coldhead, i thought about something like that… but loops in js are confusing
[23:00:59] <Es0teric> lol
[23:01:13] <Es0teric> also, it triggers all the elements at once when i hover over one of them
[23:01:14] <coldhead> it's definitely weird
[23:01:25] <coldhead> oh no that shouldn't be
[23:02:04] <coldhead> i'm seeing the right stuff http://jsfiddle.net/MbG5J/7/
[23:02:06] <coldhead> i think
[23:02:07] <Es0teric> coldhead, every time i tried fixing this… i either had a result that triggered all the elements at once OR a result that was inconsistent
[23:02:19] <coldhead> try the thing i fiddled you
[23:02:25] <coldhead> that should do neither of those things
[23:02:50] <Es0teric> coldhead, what you fiddled me doesnt even activate lol
[23:04:43] <coldhead> good grief
[23:05:00] <Es0teric> i will try to impliment what you did though
[23:06:38] <coldhead> Es0teric: try to make your HTML simpler, too
[23:06:41] <coldhead> this is very confusing
[23:06:48] <coldhead> good luck!
[23:06:56] <Es0teric> coldhead, thats as simple as i can make it
[23:06:57] <Es0teric> lol
[23:07:05] <Es0teric> because the validator kept throwing me errors
[23:07:11] <Es0teric> thats how i had to make it w/o getting errors
[23:07:42] <jtoy> how can I take 'hello world' and do a replace to get 'XhelloX world'  I want to reference the hello  ?     something like 'hello world'.replace(/hello/i, "XhelloX");
[23:08:49] <coldhead> ?eval 'hello world'.replace(/hello/i, "XhelloX");
[23:08:52] <bot-t> coldhead: "XhelloX world"
[23:09:00] <coldhead> good work, jtoy
[23:09:02] <coldhead> case closed
[23:09:18] <jtoy> the hello is a variable
[23:09:28] <coldhead> uh oh
[23:09:29] <jtoy> so without knowing its hello
[23:09:34] <jtoy> you knew that!
[23:10:00] <coldhead> i didn't,  i am fairly dim
[23:10:42] <jtoy> can you help me with that then
[23:11:37] <Es0teric> coldhead, the var holder turns into the changed element from evnt.html()
[23:15:21] <jtoy> coldhead:  i got it
[23:20:43] <coldhead> Es0teric: i don't know what's going on with all your crazy html but here's just the bit i can understand http://jsfiddle.net/4BekS/
[23:20:46] <coldhead> that works :D
[23:21:07] <Es0teric> lmao
[23:21:20] <skyl> anyone happen to know how I can get rid of that little bit of border behind the dialog here: http://jsfiddle.net/N7Z9e/1069/
[23:22:10] <Es0teric> coldhead, how do i make it grab the entire <p> tag of the data-type?
[23:22:58] <coldhead> Es0teric: link me to your code again?
[23:23:35] <Es0teric> coldhead -> http://jsfiddle.net/MbG5J/
[23:24:27] <Aleskimo> Hey =)
[23:25:26] <TheKaiser> if I have a div with id test on the bottom of the page, this should work right? $('html,body').animate({scrollTop: $('#test').offset().top}, 2000);
[23:27:18] <coldhead> oh i see what you mean, Es0teric, you could use the outerhtml plugin
[23:27:19] <coldhead> OR
[23:27:25] <coldhead> you could just clone the actual element
[23:27:29] <coldhead> and restore it
[23:27:31] <Joe_S> skyl: this works http://jsfiddle.net/N7Z9e/1075/
[23:27:35] <coldhead> instead of using html()
[23:27:48] <Joe_S> there was a border-bottom style applied to the body
[23:28:31] <Es0teric> coldhead, say what? lol
[23:28:32] <skyl> ahhh, applied to the body, mfer .. you rock, Joe_S
[23:29:34] <Joe_S> your welcome :)
[23:30:00] <coldhead> Es0teric: http://jsfiddle.net/MbG5J/9/
[23:30:14] <coldhead> that still needs your loving ooh baby but it uses a clone instead of html()
[23:30:33] <coldhead> got to have alll your lovinnnng
[23:30:48] <skyl> Joe_S, it's weird that it looks like you can unset that in css but have to do it in JS, are you seeing that?
[23:30:58] <skyl> can't* unset it in css
[23:31:13] <coldhead> i need to have more beer now, Es0teric, so i am going to be less and less help, i am sorry
[23:31:24] <coldhead> beer and sedatives
[23:31:40] <Es0teric> lol its cool
[23:33:04] <Joe_S> skyl: yea I noticed that too, I tried doing it in css first but it didn't want to work
[23:33:07] <Joe_S> not sure why this is
[23:33:19] <coldhead> but do you see how clone helps you Es0teric ?
[23:33:33] <Es0teric> coldhead, let me try the code first
[23:33:35] <Es0teric> in a min
[23:33:59] <coldhead> ACTUALLY Es0teric, is all this clone stuff actually necessary? couldn't you just have all the things you need in the HTML and show/hide particular elements on hover?
[23:34:42] <Es0teric> coldhead, i would do that but i am trying to do something specific like.. when the image is hovered show, but when its hovered out of the parent element then hide
[23:34:57] <Es0teric> im sure i cant do that in css
[23:36:09] <coldhead> not in css but in JS
[23:36:16] <coldhead> just show() and hide()
[23:36:25] <coldhead> rather than saving and restoring things
[23:39:40] <coldhead> Es0teric: http://jsfiddle.net/yfBLW/
[23:39:54] <coldhead> so lazy
[23:41:25] <coldhead> lazier http://jsfiddle.net/yfBLW/1/
[23:42:01] <Es0teric> coldhead, i see your point
[23:42:02] <Es0teric> lol
[23:44:52] <Es0teric> coldhead, .clone() is not achieving results
[23:56:20] <diverdude> I have a plugin which  basically wraps a jquery container: $([]). In each entry of the container i put custom objects. Is it possible to somehow utilize jquerys excellent filtering techniques to call a function on a subset of the objects in the jquery container? I mean similar to when you do eg. $("h1").slice(3,7).css("border","solid") i would like to be able to do myJQcontainer.slice(3,7).myObjFunc(someinput); Is that possible to do?
