[01:07:00] <sydbarret> anybody awake?
[12:56:32] <Obsdark> Hello good people
[12:56:37] <Obsdark> Any idea why this script is not finding the backend? https://nopaste.chaoz-irc.net/view/b04c5c6e
[12:56:47] <Obsdark> The console error and the code is there
[13:00:01] <shoky> Obsdark that error is just that it's not finding the source-map file for the minified .js - it doesn't matter
[13:01:19] <Obsdark> Well, then i don't have any errors but still doesn't work :S
[13:01:26] <Obsdark> thanks in any case Shoky
[13:02:22] <shoky> Obsdark: not clear what `params` and `key` is. also you're not copying the .checked property of the checkboxes
[13:02:40] <shoky> Obsdark: also, you're doing e.name and e.value  but e is the event object, not the element (that's e.target)
[13:02:53] <Obsdark> you are so right in some many things shoky
[13:02:54] <Obsdark> thanks
[13:02:57] <Obsdark> give me a se
[13:02:58] <Obsdark> sec*
[15:51:21] <Obsdark> yep, i change all what you said shoky, doesn't work :S
[15:51:26] <Obsdark> now the code is like this https://nopaste.chaoz-irc.net/view/f4b2ff79
[15:51:33] <Obsdark> no error message either
[15:52:08] <Obsdark> not even show the console.logs
[17:14:23] <Alina-malina> i am not sure, but does jquery have an interactive live "shell" so server could remotely change dom, request for dom while user is on page?
[17:31:06] <shoky> Obsdark: hiddenField.value = e.target.checked;   doesn't make much sense
[17:31:34] <shoky> ifyou don't get the console.log()s then the function is not being called - fix that first
