[00:00:17] <Doonce> its a checkbox btw
[00:17:51] <natrixnatrix89> Chibby_: that doesn't really explain how to get the value of the uploaded file progress from ajax. It just tells how to pass a value to the progressbar ui, which would be the easy part..
[00:22:32] <Doonce> nvm got text thing..
[00:32:00] <obsd123_> can anyone help me figure out why .show() isn't working?  It works with an older version of jquery, same script, but not with 1.6.2 http://codepad.org/N4jXIb8d
[00:33:21] <Doonce> is the element set to display:none?
[00:33:38] <obsd123_> Doonce: yes
[00:34:00] <Doonce> try toggle?
[00:34:28] <Sora_> lol
[00:34:30] <obsd123_> makes no difference
[00:34:56] <obsd123_> I assumed toggle was just a wrapper around .show()
[00:35:03] <Doonce> no
[00:35:07] <Doonce> .toggle instead of .show
[00:35:09] <Sora_> empty()
[00:35:14] <obsd123_> yes, either way I tried that
[00:35:18] <obsd123_> and it didn't work
[00:35:28] <Sora_> is .empty()
[00:36:00] <obsd123_> Sora_: :)
[00:36:04] <obsd123_> tyvm
[00:36:10] <Sora_> np np ^^;
[00:36:19] <obsd123_> I didn't know that cleared out the css
[00:36:19] <obsd123_> doh
[00:36:38] <Doonce> it removes all child elements
[00:36:52] <Doonce> well, child nodes
[00:37:14] <Doonce> http://api.jquery.com/empty/
[00:38:00] <Sora_> i need another beer
[00:38:02] <Sora_> u.u
[00:38:14] <obsd123_> wonder why it worked in an older version of jquery
[00:38:22] <obsd123_> is that a recent phenomena?
[00:38:32] <obsd123_> (removing all child nodes, that is)
[00:39:07] <Sora_> nop
[00:51:13] <coldhead> someone can get me beer
[00:51:14] <coldhead> ?
[00:51:25] <dr0id> http://vaporjs.com/
[00:52:33] <systemfault> dr0id: I love it.
[00:52:43] <systemfault> dr0id: Very lightweight indeed.
[00:52:49] <dr0id> yeah, Ultimate
[00:53:09] <dr0id> jQuery is nothing compared to it
[00:53:09] <systemfault> And the tests are good.
[00:53:22] <coldhead> jQuery is flabby
[00:53:46] <dr0id> I am using it in "every" project
[00:54:11] <dr0id> best part is, its SUPERBLY backward compatible. even if you haven't used it in your earlier projects, it'll auto-load itself in those and get used
[00:54:24] <dr0id> can you believe that ?!
[00:54:25] <Doonce> im glad they packed it, that makes it even smaller
[00:54:51] <dr0id> first lib where the minified version's size is equal to the non-minified version, can you believe that ?!
[00:54:52] <systemfault> dr0id: The best part is that the backward compatibility is perfect.
[00:54:56] <dr0id> indeed
[00:55:31] <dr0id> ohh, and it is forward compatible too!
[00:55:39] <systemfault> YES!
[00:55:46] <Doonce> thats crazy
[00:56:07] <systemfault> It's so awesome that I load it twice on my website.
[00:56:08] <Doonce> its so small, packing it made it even bigger
[00:56:11] <dr0id> first software EVAR, to be forward compatible!!!!
[00:56:19] <dr0id> LOL
[00:56:25] <systemfault> It's so awesome that JSLint doesn't complain about it!
[00:56:46] * dr0id waits for some humour from the gr8 coldhead
[00:57:09] <dr0id> brb, food
[00:57:41] <coldhead> oops i took too long
[01:43:06] <K1ng> can anyone invite me to google+?
[02:29:58] <kam187osx> hey guys
[02:30:02] <kam187osx> got a really wierd problem
[02:30:38] <kam187osx> i'm loading jquery in the normal way <script src="javascript/jquery-1.6.2.min.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
[02:30:54] <kam187osx> and then in the same page fade, hide, load etc
[02:31:36] <kam187osx> on the first load on an android phone, i see an error about jquery not being defined :/
[02:31:46] <kam187osx> if i refresh the page its fine
[02:57:29] <coldhead> ?ready @ kam187osx
[02:57:29] <bot-t> kam187osx, .ready(handler): Specify a function to execute when the DOM is fully loaded. http://api.jquery.com/ready/
[02:57:37] <coldhead> are you using that to wrap your code?
[02:57:42] <kam187osx> yes
[02:58:08] <coldhead> and are you loading jQuery before your other JS executres?
[02:58:17] <coldhead> because taht really should be fine >: |
[03:00:18] <kam187osx> yes
[03:00:23] <kam187osx> it really makes no sense
[03:00:29] <kam187osx> its such simple code
[03:00:57] <kam187osx> its as if its not loading jquery.js completly and moves onto the rest of the page
[03:02:02] <^zoggy^> is there any tools out there to help optimize jquery code? aka i want to paste some code into something and have it refactor/analyze
[03:02:03] <coldhead> can you pastebin your code?
[03:02:32] <kam187osx> sure
[03:02:35] <coldhead> i know of no such tool sorry ^zoggy^
[03:02:44] <kam187osx> the thing is it works fine on chrome ont he desktop :/
[03:02:48] <kam187osx> emme pastebin it
[03:02:55] <coldhead> weirder and weirder
[03:07:08] <kam187osx> http://pastie.org/2191465
[03:09:32] <kam187osx> i get errors in the lightbox etc scripts saying jquery is not defined
[03:09:54] <kam187osx> if i refresh the page its fine :/
[03:14:57] <kam187osx> wierd huh
[03:15:05] <coldhead> deeply
[03:15:05] <iksik> hi
[03:15:40] <kam187osx> maybe i can just catch errors and reload the page
[03:15:41] <kam187osx> fugly
[03:15:46] <coldhead> kam187osx: this xml isn't valid
[03:15:49] <iksik> i'm looking for a plugin which can do something like this http://jsfiddle.net/aflin/vbSMy/ ( with div rotate ) but much simplier then this one... without skew/resize and lot of other not needed things...
[03:15:51] <kam187osx> oh?
[03:15:58] <kam187osx> dreamweaver made that
[03:16:14] <coldhead> the <link just before you include jQuery isn't closed
[03:16:35] <kam187osx> omfg
[03:17:25] <kam187osx> u mean the />  ?
[03:17:39] <coldhead> yes
[03:17:48] <kam187osx> dreamweaver keeps doing that all over the place
[03:17:59] <coldhead> it can't be helping
[03:18:06] <kam187osx> lets see
[03:18:16] <coldhead> even if it's not the problem i'd avoid using a) xhtml and b) dreamweaver
[03:18:25] <coldhead> and c) those together, esp.
[03:18:46] <coldhead> if that IS the problem it's kind of awesome that a reload fixes it
[03:18:57] <kam187osx> nope same thing
[03:19:28] <coldhead> try validating your xhtml
[03:19:35] <coldhead> i just glanced at tit
[03:19:37] <coldhead> lol tit
[03:19:38] <coldhead> it*
[03:19:41] <coldhead> there might be other problems
[03:20:29] <kam187osx> ok lets see
[03:20:36] <coldhead> iksik: did you try googling for query image rotate plugin? there are lots
[03:20:54] <iksik> yes, but i can't find any with d&d
[03:21:27] <kam187osx> well dreamweaver has frozen
[03:21:39] <coldhead> that can't be good >: |
[03:21:44] <coldhead> try an online validator
[03:21:47] <kam187osx> ok
[03:22:20] <coldhead> iksik: using the one you already linked to might be simplest then
[03:22:32] <coldhead> even if you have to comment out/hide the stuff you don't want
[03:22:54] <coldhead> i agree that one is really excessive
[03:22:56] <coldhead> but it works
[03:24:59] <coldhead> kam187osx: this is flagging a few errors: http://validator.w3.org/check
[03:25:05] <coldhead> and they matter, xhtml is pretty strict
[03:25:17] <coldhead> it needs to be valid xml AND sensible html
[03:26:31] <kam187osx> yeah
[03:26:34] <kam187osx> i'm fixing it :)
[03:27:15] <coldhead> good luck!
[03:30:15] <kam187osx> doh same error
[03:36:38] <kam187osx> hmm
[03:36:40] <kam187osx> very odd
[03:36:46] <kam187osx> so its passed all the checks
[03:36:52] <kam187osx> it works when i set my phone to wifi
[03:36:55] <kam187osx> but not over 3g
[03:37:10] <kam187osx> a guy looking at my web site has a slow connection and he pointed out a bug
[03:37:16] <kam187osx> seems related to this
[03:37:20] <kam187osx> how wierd
[03:37:26] <kam187osx> i guess i'll just catch the error
[03:38:25] <Vorspire> catch it and kill it with FIRE
[03:42:42] <kam187osx> bah refresh loop
[03:42:45] <kam187osx> wtf
[03:45:16] <Ilya> test
[03:46:12] <kam187osx> test fAIL
[03:48:32] <j_wright> ... not ok 1
[03:50:16] <kam187osx> u dunno wtf it is
[03:50:21] <kam187osx> i even converted to html4
[03:50:23] <kam187osx> same shit
[03:50:35] <kam187osx> its got to be the crappy browser on android i guess
[03:53:39] <pr0ton> has anybody used the Google Maps API before?
[03:53:47] <pr0ton> my div doesnt load for some reason
[03:53:51] <pr0ton> what special CSS do you need?
[03:58:36] <kasunLak> hi all, I have a listview in a page called say a.html and once one item is selected I want to navigate to say b.html which has some js code I am trying to use <a href='b.html'> but js is not executed
[03:58:55] <kasunLak> Any help please?
[04:02:45] <crashev> hello, I use jquery-ui (autocomplete from it), I use $(ui.item).val() in function  select: function(event, ui) {} - it used to work, now with jquery 1.6.x I get error: e.nodeName is undefined <- how to fix this ?
[04:06:10] <juha___> yay i got my first paypal donation ever. time to quit my dayjob?
[04:07:19] <soldjuh> it's probably a family relative :/
[04:08:17] <pr0ton> can i have a form inside another form?
[04:08:37] <soldjuh> no you cant IMHO
[04:08:51] <pr0ton> how do you get around it then?
[04:08:54] <juha___> yes you can
[04:08:54] <pr0ton> basically i need to do this
[04:08:59] <pr0ton> juha___, how?
[04:09:00] <juha___> but it will not work
[04:09:04] <pr0ton> ...
[04:09:10] <juha___> :D
[04:09:18] <soldjuh> isn't a form inside a form invalid HTML ?
[04:09:28] <pr0ton> ok, anyway, i think i'll just use a A instead of a submit
[04:09:36] <juha___> i have "two" inner forms
[04:09:39] <pr0ton> to 'simulate' a form
[04:10:07] <juha___> what i do is i change action attr when needed, also change inputs when needed
[04:11:19] <soldjuh> or just make a dynamic $.post()
[04:12:36] <fuchstronaut> guys i lost firebug.
[04:12:39] <fuchstronaut> i minimized it
[04:12:45] <fuchstronaut> now i cant find it on my taskbar and my desktop
[04:12:52] <fuchstronaut> :-(
[04:13:37] <kam187osx> well well well!
[04:13:38] <kam187osx> http://dev.jquery.it/ticket/8917
[04:13:39] <soldjuh> F12
[04:14:06] <soldjuh> while focused on your browser that is.
[04:14:21] <soldjuh> http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/sandwich.png
[04:14:23] <fuchstronaut> it's not coming back, guess i'll have to restart ff
[04:23:38] <kam187osx> erm whats the benefit of xhtml anyway?
[04:39:17] <kasunLak> hi all, is it possible to use rel: external like in <a href> for mobile.changePage?
[04:42:24] <moo-_-> kasunLak: try with a custom click() handler and trigger changePage() call yourself?
[04:46:45] <kasunLak> moo-_-,  Did you mean something like this?   $("#submit").click(function() {  changePage( "x.html", { transition: "slideup"} );}
[04:47:08] <CandyClaws> is there any way to set the state of toggle()?
[04:47:52] <moo-_-> kasunLak: yes
[04:48:04] <moo-_-> but you probable also want e.preventDefault() and return true too
[04:48:20] <moo-_-> CandyClaws: hide() or show() maybe?
[04:48:53] <CandyClaws> naw, the mouse event toggle, not the effect
[04:52:58] <PeterPan-> guys I got a problem with a json response
[04:53:13] <PeterPan-> then I try to iterate through an array
[04:53:52] <PeterPan-> there is always a Object { "Id": "idijoji" } in front of the entity
[04:54:07] <PeterPan-> how do I remove Object?
[04:59:47] <kasunLak> moo-_-, I tried but still the url is with .......#x.html
[05:00:10] <kasunLak> so the js in x.html is not executing?
[05:10:20] <pr0ton> how do i set the event, where enter is pressed in an input field?
[05:13:04] <moo-_-> kasunLak: no
[05:13:11] <cfk_> hi, someone using colorbox? i'm trying to combine it with swfobject and it works fine on ff3, but not on ie8 ...
[05:13:11] <moo-_-> kasunLak: it loads the page via AJAX by default
[05:13:15] <moo-_-> kasunLak: so the URL does not change
[05:13:27] <moo-_-> kasunLak: check your Firebug console and see if it's making proper requests
[05:18:04] <CandyClaws> how do you undo preventDefault?
[05:18:19] <kasunLak> moo-_-, yes, what I want is to disable ajax like in <a href="x.html" rel="external">?
[05:18:39] <moo-_-> kasunLak: it should be disabled by default?
[05:19:00] <moo-_-> it is little bit unclear for me what you actually try to do
[05:19:05] <moo-_-> can you tell more background about the problem?
[05:19:10] <moo-_-> what kind of pages, why
[05:21:58] <kasunLak> moo-_-, I am trying to authenticate a user by their username and password and if those are correct they will be directed to this say x.html which is a dashboard kind of page which has some ajax call to render its view
[05:22:26] <moo-_-> and the redirect part is not working?
[05:23:00] <kasunLak> no, its redirected to x.html but the ajax call on that are not working so the page is blank
[05:23:19] <moo-_-> URL says it's x.html?
[05:23:28] <moo-_-> how you you redirect?
[05:23:50] <kasunLak> using that click function on submit buttion
[05:24:43] <moo-_-> and then you do changePage()?
[05:24:49] <kasunLak> yes
[05:24:52] <moo-_-> ah hah
[05:25:00] <moo-_-> sounds like the input for changePage() could be incorrect
[05:25:17] <moo-_-> you need to use Firebug to inspect the blank page, see what elements and input it is pulling in
[05:25:23] <moo-_-> if there are any javascript errors and such
[05:25:34] <moo-_-> you can use firebug to inspect to see what's happening
[05:25:54] <moo-_-> what data comes in
[05:26:05] <moo-_-> and why does it not end up to the HTML
[05:26:05] <kasunLak> json feeds from my localhost
[05:26:18] <moo-_-> kasunLak: also, you can do window.location = "http://newpage"
[05:26:23] <moo-_-> if you want to do a normal page load
[05:26:26] <moo-_-> instead of jquery mobile one
[05:27:28] <pr0ton> how to disable the calling of .submit when i hit enter on a input text field?
[05:27:39] <khaan> hi everybody, is there anyone familiar with the quicksand plugin? :)
[05:27:52] <khaan> i'm having an issue concerning video embedding inside of a div
[05:28:11] <aikInsaan> hi everyone, any suggestions on jquery tooltip? maybe a pointer to a decent plugin?
[05:28:14] <khaan> when i make that, the height of the container div gets a wrong height in firefox
[05:28:51] <jrockjiggz> ?:radio
[05:28:52] <bot-t> :radio: Selects all elements of type radio. http://api.jquery.com/radio-selector/
[05:34:25] <khaan> does anyone knows how do i load the content of a div from a different page (same site, btw) without loading the rest of the template?
[05:37:48] <kasunLak> moo-_-: Yes, for now I will use window.location though I loose transition. :-)
[05:38:06] <kasunLak> moo-_-: Thank you very much for the help!
[05:40:12] <kasunLak> moo-_-, ; here are some more people with the same issue
[05:40:14] <kasunLak> http://forum.jquery.com/topic/mobile-changepage-and-rel-external

[06:02:03] <Lion31> how to remove an element from a HTML snippet (not jet in DOM).... tried like this: $(tpl).find('a.edit_ad').remove(); ... but not working
[06:02:44] <damilare> Lion31 is tpl a variable ?
[06:02:48] <Lion31> the element is found inside and console.log($(tpl).find('a.edit_ad').remove()); gives me the element, but it is not actually removed from tpl
[06:03:15] <Lion31> damilare: yes
[06:03:34] <Lion31> variable with the html snippet
[06:04:27] <damilare> why don't you try $('a.edit_ad').remove();
[06:05:02] <Lion31> because that would remove a.edit from DOM, and it is not in DOM ;)
[06:05:57] <damilare> you want to remove it from the html snippet ?
[06:06:24] <Lion31> YEs
[06:06:33] <damilare> I see
[06:06:54] <damilare> never tried anything like that
[06:07:19] <Lion31> I have done it some time ago... but don't remember how though :D
[06:07:39] <damilare> but why don't you append the snippet to the dom, remove a.edit_ad and then copy the snippet  ?
[06:07:47] <damilare> copy the modified dom rather
[06:08:45] <rchavik> hi, i have a button that triggers an ajax call, and the error callback needs to operate on the element that calls it.  what's the jquery way?  http://bin.cakephp.org/view/524396118
[06:08:56] <Lion31> nah I need to process the tpl (html snippet) first and then append it to the DOM
[06:09:52] <damilare> add it as an hidden node first, process it, remove it and add it back
[06:10:02] <damilare> hackish :)
[06:10:17] <damilare> but there is a better way of procesing it using regexp
[06:10:43] <damilare> cos I think selectors only work with DOM
[06:11:31] <damilare> ok how about constructing a dom
[06:11:43] <damilare> then add the dom as a context in the selector, and do your processing
[06:11:45] <Lion31> selectors does not work only in DOM.... and inserting it first in a hidden field would it be SLOW... I know I can do it woth regex but I tried to use jquery fiorst since the selectors are great ;)
[06:11:52] <damilare> the dom doesnt have to be in the document
[06:12:09] <damilare> yeah true
[06:21:28] <damilare> Lion31 how did you sort it out
[06:21:29] <Lion31> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3331449/jquery-remove-element-from-string
[06:21:34] <Lion31> lol

[06:32:47] <KyleSmithNew> So many channels, love it.
[06:33:16] <KyleSmithNew> If I have some divs and in a div its a box and in the div box there is writing etc, how do I hide the div using the jquery features?
[06:36:07] <kggle> .hide()
[06:37:28] <KyleSmithNew> Yes, but if I target just the box div will it hide the text aswell?
[06:37:43] <KyleSmithNew> I was wondering would it all be done in one and if not is it possible some way
[06:39:17] <kam187osx> it works! halleluleah http://www.base2solutions.com/walkabout/
[06:39:22] <kam187osx> and now its time to sleep!
[06:39:28] <dabear> KyleSmithNew: if you hide a div, you will hide everything inside, including text
[06:40:01] <K1ng> someone please help me
[06:40:45] <K1ng> http://k1ng.php-dev.net/form/
[06:40:57] <K1ng> when i submit the form... it does not validate :(
[06:41:02] <KyleSmithNew> thanks dabear
[06:50:20] <K1ng> Omg please help me
[06:53:23] <KyleSmithNew> How could I have a div where its hidden then if I do a php statement and if the statment is true to get it to show?
[06:59:49] <dabear> KyleSmithNew: huh. don't use jquery for that. use classes .hidden{ display:none} and .visible{ display:block}
[07:00:18] <pigiman> hey, does anyone knows how can I get element.outerHeight() without using jQuery?
[07:00:49] <dabear> and then do <div class="<?php echo (...)? "hidden": "visible"    ?>"> KyleSmithNew
[07:01:15] <dabear> ?outerheight
[07:01:16] <bot-t> .outerHeight([includeMargin]): Get the current computed height for the first element in the set of matched elements, including padding and border. http://api.jquery.com/outerHeight/
[07:01:23] <dabear> @pigiman
[07:01:41] <pigiman> without using jqUery :)
[07:01:54] <dabear> then why are you asking here? :/
[07:02:08] <pigiman> because its still javascript. never mind,  thanks
[07:02:58] <dabear> find the innerheight, add the borders and margins
[07:03:07] <dabear> and you have your outerheight
[07:06:25] <aikInsaan> hi...can someone work with me on this http://pastebin.com/r34tDUZL
[07:18:36] <KyleSmithNew> dabear, confused me a bit lol.
[07:23:20] <trainface> hey. in short, what could cause var logname = $("#lognickname").val(); to always stay "undefined" even when a value is given? -> <input type="text" id="lognickname" />
[07:23:29] <trainface> if i add a default value, it always returns the default value
[07:29:35] <K1ng> someone please help me with jquery.validate
[07:32:36] * K1ng cries
[07:33:34] <khaan> hi everybody. How can i load with jquery the content of another page's div? (same site)
[07:33:53] <K1ng> ajax
[07:34:19] <trainface> http://api.jquery.com/load/
[07:35:26] <K1ng> i am trying to get a shit working
[07:35:32] <K1ng> but its doesnt work at all :(
[07:36:08] <khaan> trainface: i tried, but i get the whole page loaded
[07:36:27] <khaan> i have something like http://www.whatever.com/index.php #content
[07:36:55] <khaan> but instead of having only the content of #content  loaded i am brought to the whole page positioned to that div
[07:37:15] <K1ng> use regex
[07:37:43] <khaan> regex?
[07:42:30] <khelll> Can anyone tell me what's wrong with this http://pastie.org/2192261
[07:42:59] <K1ng> console.log($checkbox);
[07:43:36] <K1ng> khelll, please use jsfiddle
[07:44:04] <khelll> K1ng, no the selector is not working at all
[07:44:07] <zef88> Hello, any ideas why img.width() might be returning 0, while img[0].width returns the right size?
[07:45:40] <K1ng> zef88, because img is an array
[07:47:03] <khelll> k1ng http://jsfiddle.net/Fk5cZ/
[07:47:59] <zef88> Klng, no image is not an array, it's a jquery Object, I just use the brackets operator to cast back to a regular DOM object
[07:50:49] <K1ng> zef88, what made you think [] is object?
[07:51:26] <K1ng> zef88, try console.log(img);
[07:53:55] <trainface> hey. in short, what could "interrupt" var logname = $("#lognickname").val(); to always stay "undefined" even when a value is given? -> <input type="text" id="lognickname" /> it works fine on empty files tho.
[08:02:49] <cfk_> can someone help me debug this weird problem in IE? i've uploaded my page at http://www.switchtoplanb.com/switchtoplanb/work

[08:35:10] <jetienne_> in qunit, is there something to like noraise() ? i have seen raise() but not noraise
[08:46:26] <impi> hello, i have to construct a url with query parameteres, but i have to not add the duplicates: i have made some progress and can now get the whole new url as a json object, but how to i take that to a string like: param=1&param2=1&param3=1 - as you can see i am here : http://pastebin.com/3uZ7NNax
[08:48:39] <anli__> Isnt .text() giving the text of an option if the option misses as value?
[08:49:53] <polarbear4> is it possible to do an ajax post from one domain to another sending along a json object?
[08:50:06] <anli__> hm, could not get the text from the options even if I add values to them
[08:50:08] <anli__> wow
[08:51:17] <anli__> polarbear4: I think its possible, try it, but I never send json objects, only form variables
[08:51:20] <anli__> I get json in return
[08:51:26] <anli__> ?tias
[08:51:27] <bot-t> Try It And See
[08:51:50] <anli__> Thanks bot-t, although the explanation was not very long
[08:52:53] <polarbear4> when i try to post, i am getting an error in firebug (well status is 200 OK but it is red. not sure what its from.).
[08:53:20] <anli__> Can you see the result of the posting?
[08:53:38] <anli__> If you check "response"
[08:53:41] <polarbear4> no response. i see the params sent fine.
[08:53:45] <anli__> aha
[08:53:53] <anli__> Can you see an error code?
[08:53:56] <polarbear4> in my php file i am posting do, i just have an echo to see if it works.
[08:54:07] <polarbear4> no error code.
[08:54:13] <anli__> But its red
[08:54:27] <polarbear4> yes
[08:54:33] <anli__> There is a "status" column as 2nd column, isnt it?
[08:54:40] <polarbear4> 200 OK
[08:54:44] <anli__> aha
[08:55:10] <anli__> So are you sure you receive it correctly in the server end then?
[08:55:16] <anli__> How do you send the json data?
[08:55:28] <anli__> As 2nd parameter to $.post?
[08:55:32] <polarbear4> i am just sending a static string right now to see if the post would work and it's not.
[08:55:36] <anli__> yeah
[08:55:41] <polarbear4> i am doing: $.ajax
[08:55:45] <polarbear4> with type post
[08:55:45] <anli__> ok
[08:55:52] <anli__> Do you need error codes?
[08:56:00] <anli__> I mean, do the client side bother about errors?
[08:56:06] <anli__> And report them to the user?
[08:56:12] <polarbear4> not right now.
[08:56:15] <anli__> Ah, ok
[08:56:23] <polarbear4> and the error line is 18 of jquery.min
[08:56:28] <anli__> I think its a php error then
[08:56:59] <anli__> lets see
[08:57:08] <polarbear4> the php code is literally <?php echo 'test'; ?>
[08:57:37] <anli__> hm
[08:57:49] <anli__> Can you pm me the url?
[08:58:22] <anli__> wait wait, do this
[08:58:44] <polarbear4> this is my js
[08:58:45] <polarbear4> http://pastebin.com/tQAF96dp
[08:58:48] <anli__> <?php echo '{test:"foo"}';?>
[08:58:58] <anli__> Maybe the php side must return json as well
[08:59:40] <anli__> hm, but maybe not, since I can read that you do not use $.ajax that way
[08:59:53] <anli__> Add an error function as well
[09:00:01] <anli__> I mean failure, isnt it called that?
[09:00:36] <anli__> nope, its error
[09:00:38] <anli__> sorry
[09:00:45] <anli__> I dont use it that much
[09:01:01] <polarbear4> trying error now
[09:01:07] <ryanneufeld> anli__: you can also use the deferred that is returned by $.ajax
[09:01:35] <ryanneufeld> var dfd = $.ajax({}); dfd.fail(function(){});
[09:02:37] <anli__> ok
[09:02:40] <polarbear4> the xhr status was 0 and the thrown error was an empty string...
[09:02:44] <anli__> I created a version of your paste
[09:02:50] <anli__> http://pastebin.com/7eX5wz2n
[09:03:10] <anli__> Ah, I was too late
[09:03:56] <ryanneufeld> polarbear4: I just came in, what's the problem you're trying to solve?
[09:04:21] <polarbear4> i am doing an ajax post to another domain and am getting an error when trying to do so.
[09:04:33] <ryanneufeld> you can't do that
[09:04:33] <polarbear4> js: http://pastebin.com/tQAF96dp
[09:04:38] <anli__> Aha, problem solved
[09:04:53] <ryanneufeld> Same Origin Policy prevents it
[09:04:56] <anli__> Then you have to do a posting to the server side which can forward to the other domain, using curl
[09:05:09] <ryanneufeld> wait
[09:05:17] <ryanneufeld> that's part of it
[09:05:23] <ryanneufeld> that other domain
[09:05:30] <ryanneufeld> has to allow posts from other domains
[09:05:36] <savid> Is $.getJSON synchronous by default?
[09:05:38] <ryanneufeld> on all my prpjects
[09:05:40] <ryanneufeld> I prevent it
[09:05:42] <ryanneufeld> savid: no
[09:05:43] <savid> if so, how do I make it async?
[09:06:04] <ryanneufeld> savid: getJSON is a convenience method for $.ajax
[09:06:23] <polarbear4> ryanneufeld: so is there a way to go about this? or can i not post to an outside domain?
[09:06:39] <savid> ryanneufeld,   hmm.  for some reason it appears to be synchronous for me.   I'm putting my call in $(document).ready(),   and when I put a 5 second sleep on the server side, the document doesn't finish loading images until the call completes.
[09:06:57] <ryanneufeld> ?p @ savid
[09:06:57] <bot-t> savid, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[09:07:14] <ryanneufeld> polarbear4: can you post to that domain from your own domain?
[09:07:27] <ryanneufeld> their server must allow it for it to work
[09:07:53] <savid> ryanneufeld,  well, it'll take me awhile to reproduce it on fiddle...  not sure I have the patience for that :-P   I'll keep hacking around on my end.
[09:08:13] <ryanneufeld> savid: without seeing your code, I can't be of much help
[09:08:29] <polarbear4> which server needs to be configured to allow it? the sending or receiving?
[09:08:35] <ryanneufeld> receiving
[09:08:44] <anli__> there is no sending server
[09:08:50] <anli__> In this case
[09:08:59] <savid> ryanneufeld,  I understand that.  I mainly just wanted to know if I should expect $.getJSON to be asynchronous,  and you answered that.  So, there must be something else wrong that I'm doing.
[09:09:07] <ryanneufeld> could be
[09:09:13] <ryanneufeld> if you're using complete
[09:09:19] <ryanneufeld> that might be the problem
[09:09:28] <ryanneufeld> that get's called even on a failure
[09:09:32] <savid> ryanneufeld,  complete?
[09:09:49] <savid> ryanneufeld,   I'm using   .done()
[09:09:59] <ryanneufeld> savid: miss-read what you typed. mea culpa
[09:10:01] <anli__> I think its obvious, the server side get the parameter and does only serve an empty page
[09:10:20] <anli__> empty pages are not cross domain error messages :)
[09:10:30] <ryanneufeld> nope
[09:10:34] <ryanneufeld> they are not
[09:11:05] <ryanneufeld> savid: just pop your code in a fiddle, I'll take a look at the JS without the html
[09:11:12] <ryanneufeld> or even pastie
[09:11:26] * anli__ pops out
[09:11:43] * anli__ pops in again
[09:11:59] <anli__> I cant solve this, I have an option which I cannot use val() or text() on, just empty strings, wtf?
[09:12:12] <ryanneufeld> polarbear4: what is the actual domain you're posting to?
[09:12:19] <savid> ryanneufeld,  http://jsfiddle.net/HALJn/
[09:13:16] <ryanneufeld> savid: abuse of var :p
[09:13:21] <anli__> There should be a plugin to xchat with a textbox where text goes to pastie and the url is written to the current channel
[09:13:35] <polarbear4> ryanneufeld: i am posting to my own domain from another.
[09:14:11] <anli__> Its a lot nicer to shorten scopes by declaring them directly before they are used
[09:14:25] <anli__> long scopes makes the code harder to read
[09:15:38] <savid> ryanneufeld,  yeah, I'm not an expert.   feel free to school me :)
[09:15:44] <ryanneufeld> savid: Will do :)
[09:16:11] <ryanneufeld> polarbear4: then if you haven't prevented cross domain posting you should be alright. Have you watched your server logs for errors?
[09:16:53] <polarbear4> no. i will check into that.
[09:17:17] <anli__> Have you used a browser to read the word "test" when you access the webpage that you posted to?
[09:17:44] <ryanneufeld> savid: http://jsfiddle.net/HALJn/1/ I just did some formatting, makes it easier to read, also a single var
[09:19:10] <anli__> What I react most about is the huge amount of vars and that they are declared in the same place
[09:20:25] <savid> ryanneufeld,  so specifying "var" multiple times has a performance impact?
[09:20:40] <kylesmith> Whats the opposit to display: hidden;
[09:20:49] <anli__> display: block
[09:20:52] <ryanneufeld> kylesmith: depends on the element
[09:20:55] <ryanneufeld> anli__: not always
[09:20:57] <anli__> true, sorry
[09:20:58] <ryanneufeld> savid: yes
[09:21:04] <savid> good to know :)
[09:21:26] <anli__> but display:hidden? I thought it was display:none
[09:21:27] <ryanneufeld> kylesmith: there is block, inline, and inline-block
[09:21:30] <kylesmith> thanks
[09:21:35] <ryanneufeld> kylesmith: depending on the elements you're working with
[09:21:58] <ryanneufeld> kylesmith: anli__ is right, it's display: none;
[09:22:19] <polarbear4> okay, now i see my server is receiving the data, but i am still getting an error on the client side.
[09:22:35] <ryanneufeld> polarbear4: is your server using $_POST?
[09:22:41] <ryanneufeld> assuming it's php
[09:22:54] <polarbear4> yes. i wrote the content to a text file to see if i got the data and i did.
[09:22:55] <anli__> You mean that you can see that the server is sending back something?
[09:23:04] <polarbear4> and i do an echo after it writes the file.
[09:24:27] <ryanneufeld> polarbear4: can you change your server script to use $_REQUEST instead of $_POST ?
[09:24:36] <ryanneufeld> then you can use get or post
[09:24:41] <ryanneufeld> and manually test the end point
[09:25:10] <polarbear4> but the server is getting everything fine. i think it must be the response.
[09:25:19] <ryanneufeld> right, my point is
[09:25:26] <ryanneufeld> that you can see the response in a browser
[09:25:33] <ryanneufeld> so you can see what it's returning
[09:25:42] <ryanneufeld> also, use firebug
[09:25:45] <ryanneufeld> and watch the console
[09:25:52] <ryanneufeld> it will give you the XHR
[09:25:59] <ryanneufeld> and you can look at the response there as well
[09:26:07] <ryanneufeld> also, try it in chrome, and watch the console there
[09:26:14] <polarbear4> i see my post and it is fine. no response.
[09:26:23] <ryanneufeld> that will tell you if it's a cross domain issue
[09:26:32] <ryanneufeld> chrome will throw an error
[09:26:34] <ryanneufeld> FF wont
[09:26:36] <polarbear4> k i will try
[09:26:53] <polarbear4> ah
[09:27:07] <anli__> Its strange, I still cannot read texts from a selectbox.find('option:selected');
[09:27:12] <polarbear4> XMLHttpRequest cannot load http://domain1.com/updateusers.php. Origin http://domain2.com is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Origin.
[09:27:24] <ryanneufeld> polarbear4: there you go
[09:27:27] <anli__> Trying alert(selectbox.find('option:selected').text());
[09:27:37] <ryanneufeld> polarbear4: you can use JSONP then
[09:27:44] <polarbear4> do you have an example of that/
[09:27:52] <rethus> i hae this kind of objecthttp://pastebin.com/Y0i7etFs
[09:27:55] <DroMastP> Hi guys !
[09:27:56] <ryanneufeld> ?jsonp @ polarbear4
[09:27:57] <polarbear4> the only thing i found was involving perl
[09:27:57] <bot-t> polarbear4, JSONP, Quickly « plaintext - http://niryariv.wordpress.com/2009/05/05/jsonp-quickly/ , What is JSONP? - http://remysharp.com/2007/10/08/what-is-jsonp/ - set the dataType for .ajax() to 'jsonp' if using .getJSON() see http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getJSON/#jsonp
[09:28:13] <rethus> how can i get the caller_-Objects one layer higher
[09:28:16] <abjorn> :o
[09:28:20] <DroMastP> many peoples here ^^
[09:28:23] <DroMastP> any frenchs ?
[09:28:24] <rethus> so that i can act like userObj.caller_
[09:28:34] <rethus> instead of userObj[0].caller_
[09:28:57] <ryanneufeld> rethus: var obj = userObj[0]; obj.caller_
[09:28:57] <anli__> lol, Cannot join #c (Channel is invite only).
[09:29:07] <anli__> Who wants an invite to that channel?
[09:29:17] <savid> ryanneufeld,  it seems that the issue I was having was more related to my development server,  which is single-threaded,  so it just wasn't returning image requests until the ajax request was complete.   mystery solved!
[09:29:28] <ryanneufeld> there you go
[09:29:35] <ryanneufeld> otherwise I couldn't find a problem with your JS
[09:29:48] <ryanneufeld> it was pretty much exactly how to use the deferred
[09:30:32] <rethus> ryanneufeld: is there a way to slice thie [0][1][n] section, but keep the underlaying one, without to walk on each key?
[09:30:47] <ryanneufeld> I'm not sure I follow
[09:31:12] <DroMastP> anybody here to help me with a newbie jquery problem ?
[09:31:18] <ryanneufeld> ?anyone
[09:31:19] <bot-t> Somewhere, someplace, in some universe, somebody uses whatever you just asked about. However, if you actually want help with it, please just ask a question; don't ask to ask, or ask if anyone can help.
[09:32:02] <ryanneufeld> rethus: if you have an array of things, and you want to apply the same function to all of them. At some point some code will have to walk over the keys. That is usually left to the developer
[09:32:07] <ryanneufeld> ie rethus
[09:32:13] <t432> anyone familar with uploadifier?
[09:32:18] <ryanneufeld> I am
[09:32:29] <ryanneufeld> you mean uploadify?
[09:32:59] <t432> yes, trying to check if a file has been uploaded upon submit if not display an alert
[09:33:04] <anli__> Hm, does .clone manage to clone options? That is probably not the case...
[09:33:27] <justicefries> ohai wookiehangover
[09:34:11] <ryanneufeld> t432: the php endpoint will echo a result, that will get passed to the complete callback
[09:34:35] <ryanneufeld> t432: there are callbacks for every condition.
[09:35:03] <t432> can you give me a link to the relavent one?
[09:35:16] <t432> ideally the solution will be a javascript
[09:35:20] <ryanneufeld> the uploadify docs
[09:35:26] <anli__> If I clone a selectbox but before I append it to something, I want to read the options, isnt that possible?
[09:35:35] <ryanneufeld> anli__: yes
[09:36:05] <ryanneufeld> var cloned = $('selector').clone();
[09:36:08] <ryanneufeld> then work with cloned
[09:37:22] <anli__> Seems that both text() and val() is blank for an option before the selectbox has got a parent, must investigate
[09:37:41] <ryanneufeld> interesting
[09:39:25] <anli__> ryanneufeld: hm, not the case, I counterproofed that
[09:40:52] <ryanneufeld> which case did you proove?
[09:41:20] <anli__> That if I clone a selectbox and alert the .text() of option:first, its the right text, a minimal example
[09:41:25] <anli__> The option did not have a value
[09:41:37] <anli__> Then I tried to clone the surrounding div of the selectbox, the same positive result
[09:41:51] <ryanneufeld> could be the depth of the clone
[09:42:02] <ryanneufeld> check the jquery docs for clone
[09:42:03] <anli__> Aha, most interesting, does it have a max depth?
[09:42:07] <anli__> aha
[09:42:38] <ryanneufeld> ?.clone()
[09:42:38] <bot-t> .clone([withDataAndEvents]): Create a copy of the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/clone/
[09:43:02] <DroMastaP> here a paste of my problem, i'm a noob, i'm sorry....
[09:43:03] <DroMastaP> http://pastebin.com/pdZiQc9R
[09:43:27] <anli__> wow, cant believe that .clone has two flag arguments
[09:43:33] <DroMastaP> my problem is from line 7 to line 12
[09:43:47] <icecream> heya hey... every time a jquery query is run, i want to inject my code
[09:43:58] <DroMastaP> I have a menu, who have tabs enabled or disabled
[09:43:58] <ryanneufeld> yup, self is undefined
[09:44:01] <ryanneufeld> you're defining after
[09:44:04] <Guest80363> so i want to check if a piece of data exists for a selector
[09:44:07] <ryanneufeld> also self is a keyword
[09:44:11] <ryanneufeld> you can't use it
[09:44:31] <DroMastaP> really ?
[09:44:42] <DroMastaP> so I can use anything but not self
[09:44:49] <ryanneufeld> not anything
[09:44:55] <DroMastaP> off course
[09:44:56] <ryanneufeld> but self is a keyword I'm pretty sure
[09:44:57] <DroMastaP> of
[09:45:05] <DroMastaP> okay, i'm gonna try another thing
[09:45:21] <ryanneufeld> also, you're defining AFTER you're comparing it
[09:45:25] <mricecreamcone> so selection gets made (e.g. $('.class')) -> each object returned is checked if it has a piece of data associated with it -> if yes, return array of those objects/elements instead
[09:45:36] <DroMastaP> yep...
[09:45:38] <mricecreamcone> what is the least invasive and simplest way of accomplishing this?
[09:45:45] <fuchstronaut> guys im trying to get some modalboxes to work but ive got problems with that container-thing
[09:46:00] <fuchstronaut> im trying just to put shadow on a certain element not the whole page
[09:46:22] <fuchstronaut> so i just put a div with a bgcolor and 50% opacity inside that element position set to absolute
[09:46:24] <DroMastaP> but my problem is to disable an active tab when I click to another one
[09:46:27] <fuchstronaut> works fine until you scrol
[09:46:27] <ryanneufeld> ?.each() @ mricecreamcone
[09:46:28] <bot-t> mricecreamcone, .each(function): Iterate over a jQuery object, executing a function for each matched element. http://api.jquery.com/each/
[09:46:48] <ryanneufeld> DroMastaP: you can't compare something that is undefined
[09:47:06] <anli__> hm, having those booleans permutated in all variants does not help me getting values out of the options
[09:47:09] <DroMastaP> I just understood that :)
[09:47:10] <mricecreamcone> ryanneufeld: i'm aware, but i want to write this as a plugin
[09:47:14] <mricecreamcone> i want implicit syntax
[09:47:26] <mricecreamcone> so i want to override $ maybe
[09:47:31] <ryanneufeld> uhm
[09:47:35] <mricecreamcone> (sounds like it's time to grab the jquery source unminified)
[09:47:42] <DroMastaP> but I dont know how to disable my old active element when I clic on another one
[09:48:22] <DroMastaP> this is my big problem
[09:48:34] <ryanneufeld> DroMastaP: $('.actif').removeClass('actif');
[09:48:43] <ryanneufeld> add the active class after that
[09:48:54] <DroMastaP> really ? i'm gonna try
[09:49:10] <ryanneufeld> mricecreamcone: have you seen $.grep?
[09:49:16] <mricecreamcone> negative
[09:49:24] <mricecreamcone> i've been working on this overlays plugin for some time
[09:49:25] <ryanneufeld> Also, you can write your own selectors
[09:49:35] <mricecreamcone> i recall reading the custom selectors part
[09:50:03] <mricecreamcone> butttt... what i want is to duplicate DOM el's as positioned el's while retaining all of the block style stuff
[09:50:08] <ryanneufeld> I would suggest that, rather than muck about with the jquery source
[09:50:27] <mricecreamcone> but i want it to be ... non-invasive, so you can still select elements as you normally would without knowing the overlaying/layering is going on
[09:50:29] <ryanneufeld> mricecreamcone: you're talking two different problems here
[09:50:42] <ryanneufeld> selection is non-invasive
[09:50:57] <mricecreamcone> what i'm dealing with is kinda hard to articulate
[09:51:12] <mricecreamcone> i think what i want is a $('.class') query to return customized results
[09:51:18] <mricecreamcone> and it can work for any query
[09:51:23] <mricecreamcone> i've done stuff like this already with.... sec
[09:51:32] <ryanneufeld> mricecreamcone: you're trying to solve too many problems at once
[09:51:39] <ryanneufeld> break it down into smaller chunks
[09:51:45] <t432> ryanneufeld: do you know the name of the variable or the id to the field that folds the name of uploaded file in uploadify?
[09:52:02] <ryanneufeld> t432: folds?
[09:52:08] <t432> holds*
[09:52:13] <mricecreamcone> likely, i'm just taking a look at this code after like 2 months hehe
[09:52:15] <DroMastaP> @ryanneufeld Thank you man, it work perfectly, thanks you very much for you time
[09:52:27] <DroMastaP> @ryanneufeld Big up from france :)
[09:52:45] <ryanneufeld> t432: http://www.uploadify.com/documentation/events/oncomplete-2/
[09:52:57] <ryanneufeld> DroMastaP: np
[09:53:20] <ryanneufeld> t432: http://www.uploadify.com/documentation/events/onerror/
[09:53:44] <ryanneufeld> t432: you may have to modify the php endpoints to produce output when it works
[09:54:26] <t432> ryanneufeld: trying to check if a file has been uploaded if not then display an error... i dont think oncomplete function is appropiate in this situation?
[09:54:37] <mricecreamcone> http://pastebin.com/sxYsv306
[09:54:38] <t432> error = alert();
[09:55:09] <mricecreamcone> so line 22, the newly created object that is acting as a "clone" gets linked via $.data to the initial object queried
[09:55:23] <t432> i c
[09:55:31] <mricecreamcone> so suppose your initial line looks like $(".class").stw().layer();
[09:56:00] <mricecreamcone> any time you reference $(".class").css('color", "#f00");   .... you should be referencing the layered DOM element, not the default element
[09:56:26] <mricecreamcone> but yea, i suppose that is a tricky problem, because say you have $(".class .subclass")
[09:56:54] <mricecreamcone> and both are layered... how the heck do you check if .class is layered, reference the layer DOM el, then check if subclass is layered... oh it would be a nightmare!
[09:56:55] <ryanneufeld> t432: with uploadify, there is the uploadify.php file
[09:57:07] <mricecreamcone> this is what i ran into a while back
[09:57:21] <mricecreamcone> it's too complex a problem to solve, and i did indeed break it up into parts
[09:57:22] <ryanneufeld> t432: the output of that is passed to the javascript callbacks
[09:57:35] <mricecreamcone> so you do sorta have to keep track of what you "layer"
[09:57:56] <ryanneufeld> mricecreamcone: I'm not familiar with the layers you're using here
[09:58:05] <ryanneufeld> I'm afraid I'm not going to be much help
[09:58:16] <ryanneufeld> but to suggest you make the problem as small as possibile
[09:58:19] <mricecreamcone> aye... it's just some plugin i'm writing
[09:58:22] <mricecreamcone> yupppppppp
[09:58:28] <mricecreamcone> it's locked up in the ivory tower bro :)
[09:58:33] <ryanneufeld> lol
[09:58:39] <mricecreamcone> hehe
[09:58:47] <mricecreamcone> a programmers bane... siiiiiiigh
[09:59:05] <anli__> wow, when I seek using selectbox.find('option:selected'), I get the first option instead of the selected option
[09:59:06] <anli__> Any clues?
[09:59:09] <mricecreamcone> ok off i go, cya!  and danke
[09:59:16] <ryanneufeld> np mricecreamcone
[09:59:42] <ryanneufeld> anli__: try just :selected ?
[09:59:58] <anli__> sure, but should be the same
[10:00:29] <ryanneufeld> should be yup
[10:00:31] <ryanneufeld> I dunno
[10:00:32] <anli__> nope
[10:00:45] <ryanneufeld> console.log your cloned item
[10:00:46] <anli__> If I clone a selectbox, maybe there is no selection in that box...
[10:00:47] <anli__> hm
[10:00:53] <ryanneufeld> could be
[10:01:02] <ryanneufeld> That would make sense
[10:01:09] <ryanneufeld> unless you had a selected attribute
[10:01:14] <ryanneufeld> on the original html
[10:02:02] <polarbear4> ryanneufeld: problem i am running into now, is that my json data is too long to send along in a get :P
[10:02:22] <ryanneufeld> ah, well, then, you ser, are hosed
[10:02:27] <polarbear4> hahah
[10:04:31] <anli__> ok, problem identified, cloned selectboxes do not have a selection
[10:05:28] <sprezzatura> i have a table with rows(tr), clicking the edit should remove the row(tr). i am able to remove it, but how do i access the id of that tr row?
[10:05:53] <anli__> is the edit in a cell?
[10:06:12] <fuchstronaut> $(this).closest('tr').attr('id')
[10:06:32] <anli__> why not just $(this).closest('tr).remove();
[10:06:37] <anli__> oops, missing a '
[10:07:03] <sprezzatura> fuchstronaut: http://jsfiddle.net/42GCf/
[10:07:08] <sprezzatura> ok.
[10:07:41] <sprezzatura> fuchstronaut: thanks. attr('id') was the needed thingy
[10:07:56] <anli__> on the contrary, you dont need the id
[10:08:09] <sprezzatura> i need to to make an ajax call
[10:08:54] <anli__> ids are seldom needed, but often used
[10:09:43] <sprezzatura> i am storing a value to make a call. its an anchor tag
[10:10:39] <MSTRCNVS> In which cirscunstances an ajax post request will fail?
[10:11:04] <MSTRCNVS> triggering the jqxhr error method
[10:11:08] <sprezzatura> MSTRCNVS: when endpoint is not present?
[10:11:55] <MSTRCNVS> sprezzatura, what do you mean?
[10:12:35] <sprezzatura> why should an ajax post fail - when the url you are hitting doesnt exist.
[10:12:43] <sprezzatura> or doesnt accept the args
[10:13:02] <anli__> :)
[10:14:50] <anli__> ok, what I had to do to successfully clone my selectbox was to save away the value that val() returns, and put in selectbox.attr('data-value').selectbox.val());, then I clone and put it back
[10:15:29] <Enginoob> Anybody know if there's a Freemarker channel?
[10:17:01] <Enginoob> Nevermind.  :P
[10:17:07] <anli__> We didnt
[10:17:52] <anli__> Maybe #java?
[10:21:34] <JohnnyDavidson> how would i register a click?
[10:21:38] <JohnnyDavidson> on nothing
[10:21:48] <JohnnyDavidson> like $('body').click or something
[10:22:13] <sprezzatura> JohnnyDavidson: $('.deleteins').click(function() {} );
[10:22:28] <sprezzatura> deleteins is the class name
[10:22:39] <JohnnyDavidson> what's .deleteins?
[10:23:17] <JohnnyDavidson> doesn't work
[10:24:21] <JohnnyDavidson> Do you know what I'm talking about?
[10:24:34] <JohnnyDavidson> I have a blank page for example, and I want something to happen when I click
[10:24:39] <Ox41464b> $(document).click(function(){alert('boo');});
[10:24:59] <JohnnyDavidson> thanks
[10:25:05] <Krooks> What a good editor ? commercial and free. Can someone recommend me 3 or 4 ?
[10:25:13] <JohnnyDavidson> notepad++
[10:25:49] <j_wright> nvi
[10:26:02] <sprezzatura> JohnnyDavidson: thats the same. you need to get used to the nomenclature
[10:26:13] <sprezzatura> i use programmer's notepad.
[10:27:19] <Krooks> dreamweaver got support for juqery ?
[10:27:39] <friedbyte> how do I use .load() and .after() to load a new div#id2 after div#id2?
[10:27:53] <friedbyte> after div#id1*
[10:28:57] <heedly> http://paste.pocoo.org/show/435344/ what sort of trick do I need to do to reference the current match varialbe for each loop?
[10:30:46] <djQuery> var $div2= $('<div></div>, {id: 'div2'}).load('url', fucntion(){ $div2.insertAfter('$div1'); }
[10:30:54] <djQuery> friedbyte: ^^^^^
[10:31:25] <friedbyte> I'll try that
[10:31:46] <sprezzatura> fuchstronaut: in that example, how do i show a confirm box?

[10:33:17] <sprezzatura> http://jsfiddle.net/42GCf/2/
[10:35:02] <Twiebie> Hey, how can I keep the parent tab highlighted when it's child is active in a simple dropdown menu? This is the menu: http://www.dynamicdrive.com/style/csslibrary/item/jquery_multi_level_css_menu_2/
[10:35:06] <fuchstronaut> sprezzatura: confirm() might be what your looking for
[10:35:11] <fuchstronaut> instead of alert
[10:36:11] <sprezzatura> fuchstronaut: did you see the updayted one? i am not sure where the confirm should be placed.
[10:36:12] <wookiehangover> Twiebie: consider using an 'active' class on the parent element
[10:36:19] <wookiehangover> or something similar
[10:37:07] <Twiebie> wookiehangover, at the moment I have the following: http://pastebin.com/mwpRhZ6E
[10:37:25] <Twiebie> That highlights the parent, but not when the child of that parent is the current active link
[10:37:36] <savid> When using $.ajax, is there a way to have the server-side response trigger the .fail() handler of the deferred object?
[10:37:58] <sprezzatura> fuchstronaut: got it.
[10:38:04] <wookiehangover> savid: respond with a 40x error

[10:43:27] <djQuery> isnt that prettier
[10:43:35] <sprezzatura> how does it look on a mobile?
[10:44:03] <djQuery> and you have more control over the formating etc. confirm = 2 buttons . dialog as many as u want

[12:36:30] <Darktex> swaagie, can't you just form a new URL w/ your parameters and write it whole?
[12:36:33] <markupboy> soc42: are you looking for the form submission to be asynchronous?
[12:36:53] <Lomex> I want to add an ID to a element which I load() can anyone tell me how to?
[12:37:11] <swaagie> Darktex, ye perhaps I should :P
[12:37:26] <Darktex> =)
[12:37:39] <swaagie> still there's gotta be a field forthat
[12:38:04] <soc42> markupboy: at the moment yes
[12:38:07] <swaagie>  /s/field/property
[12:38:51] <soc42> markupboy: in the future maybe it would be nice to have it with ajax, but that's not a must...
[12:40:03] <markupboy> take a look at this then - http://jsfiddle.net/EASSH/4/
[12:40:25] <Lomex> Is there a way to include HTML from a external file and load it to a div for example
[12:41:01] <markupboy> Lomex: http://api.jquery.com/load/
[12:41:21] <Lomex> I mean more like including from the same server
[12:41:23] <soc42> markupboy: so that's the way to do it the "ajax"-way? i'll give it a try, thanksalot
[12:41:23] <Lomex> on same request
[12:41:49] <Lomex> I want to open up a .dialog()
[12:41:54] <Lomex> And I need to store the form somewhere
[12:42:00] <Lomex> Should I just store it at DOM invisible?
[12:42:13] <markupboy> is dialog some sort of third party plugin or ... ?
[12:42:19] <Lomex> jquery ui
[12:42:22] <markupboy> ah
[12:42:41] <markupboy> yeah, you could do in page loading - where the form is in the page and set to display: none
[12:42:48] <markupboy> or, like i said, use .load to grab the form
[12:43:26] <Lomex> I could also do it in jquery style
[12:43:41] <Lomex> like var form = $("<form>...</form>")
[12:43:47] <Lomex> or is this a bad idea?
[12:43:59] <markupboy> it generally not a good idea to keep that much markup in JS
[12:44:21] <Lomex> hm
[12:44:42] <Lomex> load is async too right?
[12:44:45] <markupboy> it is
[12:44:58] <markupboy> load is just a shortcut method to .ajax()
[12:45:07] <markupboy> same with .post() and .get()
[12:45:25] <Lomex> So I would need to use success to modify elements in the grabbed code right?
[12:45:37] <markupboy> correct
[12:46:05] <Lomex> thanks :-)
[12:46:43] <Darktex> any idea about retrieving elements from a <ul> inside a droppable?
[12:47:05] <Darktex> I have say N droppables, and I need to have their lists retrieved and analyzed
[12:47:13] <Darktex> I just cannot refer to them 8(
[12:48:17] <Lomex> can I jut do
[12:48:26] <Lomex> Or how can I check if an ID for example exists?
[12:48:34] <Lomex> $("#id") != null?
[12:49:03] <markupboy> $('#id") .length > 0
[12:49:17] <Lomex> What about isEmptyObject?
[12:49:28] <markupboy> $('#id') won't ever return null, if there isn't a match, it'll always return a jquery object
[12:50:22] <markupboy> isEmptyObject won't work
[12:50:27] <Lomex> alright
[12:51:01] <Lomex> Is there a way to load stuff outside of the dom?
[12:51:11] <markupboy> because even a jquery object that doesn't match anything still has keys like context and selector - which means it's never empty
[12:51:12] <Lomex> Like $("<div></div>") would create the div outside of tom
[12:51:22] <markupboy> technically it's still in the dom
[12:51:23] <Lomex> Can i do something lke var load = $("").load(...);?
[12:51:37] <markupboy> it's just not rendered to the screen because it's not a child of <body>
[12:51:39] <ryanneufeld> $("<div></div>") .load()
[12:51:50] <Lomex> Do I need an element first to applay load to it?
[12:52:12] <markupboy> you'll probably want to save the created div to a variable so you can use it later
[12:52:13] <markupboy> like
[12:52:20] <Lomex> Well
[12:52:22] <markupboy> var $content = $('<div/>');
[12:52:42] <markupboy> $content.load('index.html');
[12:52:54] <Lomex> The page I call with load() contains all I need, so I ask if theres a way to load() that content outside of body without creating a div first?
[12:53:08] <markupboy> no
[12:53:39] <markupboy> but you can always take my example and do something like
[12:53:56] <markupboy> var $innerContent = $content.children();
[12:54:15] <Lomex> So I will just access my loaded stuff
[12:54:15] <Lomex> right?
[12:54:21] <markupboy> yes
[12:54:49] <Lomex> Maybe I can explain you what I try to do
[12:55:36] <Lomex> I want to open up a form when someone clicks on the button ( as jquery ui dialog) - But I just dont want to load form to everyone who visits the page, because its not important to all
[12:56:19] <Lomex> So I could load it outside of body, or store it inside budy invisible
[12:56:40] <Lomex> body
[12:56:41] <Lomex> *
[12:57:35] <markupboy> why not do this -
[12:59:29] <markupboy> var $dialog = $('<div/>');
[12:59:29] <markupboy> $dialog.load('path.html', function() {
[12:59:30] <markupboy> 	$dialog.dialog();
[12:59:30] <markupboy> });
[13:00:07] <Lomex> alright
[13:00:11] <Lomex> but why do </div>?
[13:00:20] <Lomex> What effect does it have
[13:00:25] <markupboy> because the content has to be loaded into something
[13:00:47] <markupboy> the dialog needs something to work against
[13:00:54] <Lomex> yes
[13:01:13] <markupboy> and with creating the <div> you don't ever have to worry about what it might be loading - whether is has a wrapper or not
[13:01:15] <Lomex> but dont I need an open/close tag? :D
[13:01:39] <markupboy> no, when creating stuff that way, you don't need an open and close tag
[13:01:46] <Lomex> thanks =)
[13:01:47] <K1ng> can anyone tell me where can i get a slider like on this site URL w/ your parameters and write it whole?
[13:01:49] <markupboy> you'll notice the tag i used was self closing
[13:01:53] <K1ng> can anyone tell me where can i get a slider like on this site http://movielegion.com/
[13:03:35] <markupboy> Lomex - take a look at this sample code - http://jsfiddle.net/haqCH/
[13:04:43] <markupboy> K1ng - you could build one
[13:05:11] <K1ng> yeah the project owner said lowest bid wins :p
[13:06:15] <dabear> I bid 1 dollar
[13:08:50] <Lomex> markupboy: Thanks for all your help. Does $(this) also refers to the object clicked If it's called in a function I call in the click event?
[13:08:54] <soc42> markupboy: when trying to use this... an error occurs... http://jsfiddle.net/EASSH/5/
[13:09:39] <ravenzz> soc42 those inline js sucks
[13:09:53] <ravenzz> ?click @ soc42
[13:09:53] <bot-t> soc42, .click(handler): Bind an event handler to the "click" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/click/
[13:10:44] <soc42> i have to pass an array-like postvar field, which causes errors in firebug console, stating that "missing : after property id"
[13:11:33] <soc42> ravenzz: what's the problem? how would you do it?
[13:12:56] <soc42> and how to pass different values with one and the same .click event-handler function?
[13:17:20] <glaksmono> how do you associate the $('#something') with 2 different ID's?
[13:20:43] <thebignoise> $('#id1, #id2')
[13:20:51] <thebignoise> glaksmono ^^
[13:20:58] <ravenzz> soc42 http://jsfiddle.net/9BNL7/ ?
[13:21:20] <thebignoise> however i dont know why your element would have to ID's
[13:24:35] <Lomex> I have a jquery dialog and it shows a form. If I submit the form I want it to send the data without leaving current page. I thought about doing it with ajax post, but I'm not exactly sure in which format I should pass the form input to my php page
[13:27:34] <soc42> ravenzz: this looks quite well! a whole different way to approach a situation like this...
[13:28:35] <soc42> but what i don't really get at the moment is how to update e.g. my result list when this postvar has been passed via ajax
[13:30:14] <ravenzz> basically your index.php will return a piece of html as output (e.g. your list)
[13:30:28] <soc42> and how would you do it the "classic" synchronous way because that ajax-approach would force the app to completely change...
[13:30:51] <ravenzz> then you will fill the results container whit those data
[13:31:36] <soc42> ravenzz: is there also something like a "pull" with jquery?
[13:32:10] <uf0> so i'm using jquery ui autocomplete
[13:32:22] <uf0> and I just want to change the position by 10 to 20 pixels
[13:32:25] <uf0> left and right
[13:32:30] <uf0> how do i do that?
[13:36:00] <soc42> hey ravenzz & markupboy... thanksalot for your instant help, i really appreciate
[13:36:37] <soc42> i'll keep on going tomorrow... time to have a break for me now
[13:36:54] <soc42> cu next time
[13:37:09] <ravenzz> yeh sosrry im so busy
[13:37:55] <soc42> no prob, thanks anyway so far
[13:38:02] <soc42> cya
[13:42:15] <Segaja> vielleicht vereinfache ich die auswertung noch
[13:42:21] <Segaja> wups wrong window sry
[13:42:45] <ravenzz> sure
[13:51:06] <natrixnatrix89> does anyone have experience here in file uploading with ajax in jquery? how exactly does that work?
[13:54:20] <jeedey> natrixnatrix89: you can either do it natively using FileAPI (only supported by one and a half browsers at the moment though) or hack around it using iframes..
[13:59:25] <buzzman> jquery validator?
[14:00:46] <natrixnatrix89> jeedey: iframes? but that won't give me the ability to use progressbar.. right?
[14:01:53] <buzzman> what's the url for online jquery validator ?
[14:02:24] <buzzman> validator?
[14:02:33] <buzzman> validate
[14:04:11] <buzzman> what's wrong with this  >  $('a.lfpop').attr('rel','lightframe');
[14:06:26] <uf0> guys any idea on how to change the position of the autocomplete dropdown
[14:06:38] <uf0> i'm using jquery ui
[14:06:46] <uf0> just trying to move it a few pixels
[14:06:50] <Lomex> Do anyone know if I need to escape some characters before using ajax post?
[14:07:42] <danheberden> Lomex not if you're just throwing in an object for the data property
[14:08:28] <Lomex> danheberden: What do you mean? I thought about creating a datastring with the form data (use val())
[14:08:30] <danheberden> e.g. $.post( url, { whatever: "wat?! i ♡ jQuery!" } );
[14:08:51] <Lomex> I want to submit a form with ajax
[14:09:17] <danheberden> i'd check out the already existing plugins, or use ben_alman's or mine serializeObject plugin
[14:09:21] <danheberden> ?serializeObject
[14:09:22] <bot-t> Whereas jQuery’s built-in .serializeArray() method serializes a form into an array, .serializeObject() serializes a form into an (arguably more useful) object. http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-misc-plugins/#serializeobject
[14:09:31] <danheberden> ?g danheberden serializeObject github
[14:09:32] <bot-t> danheberden, jQuery Plugin: .serializeObject() | danheberden - http://danheberden.com/jquery-plugin-serializeobject-2011-04-01/
[14:09:40] <buzzman> ?validator
[14:09:41] <bot-t> The W3C Markup Validation Service - http://validator.w3.org/
[14:09:59] <buzzman> ?jquery validator
[14:10:00] <bot-t> buzzman, Plugins/Validation - "But doesn't jQuery make it so very easy to write your own validation plugin?" Sure, but there still are a lot of subtleties that you have to worry about: You need a standard library of validation ... http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/validation
[14:10:11] <uf0> so i'm basically trying to move it left 9 pixels, i tried overriding with CSS but no luck
[14:10:33] <uf0> so now i'm trying to change position on autocomplete dropdown via js
[14:10:41] <uf0> not a jquery expert so..
[14:10:43] <danheberden> uf0, guessing you need to set position:relative, then left:-9px? or margin-left:-9px depending on the type of element
[14:11:10] <uf0> danheberden: autocomplete uses offset
[14:11:20] <uf0> so even if i put that
[14:11:22] <uf0> it will override
[14:11:33] <Lomex> danheberden: Will I just be able to access them correctly with $_POST in PHP?
[14:11:35] <uf0> the jquery left and right numbers
[14:11:41] <uf0> just override everything
[14:11:43] <danheberden> uf0 - !important is greater than inline
[14:11:54] <uf0> I did an important
[14:12:01] <uf0> it does take it
[14:12:09] <natrixnatrix89> jeedey: http://aquantum-demo.appspot.com/file-upload
[14:12:10] <uf0> but still it recalculates
[14:12:11] <danheberden> but did you do "!important 4sryus"
[14:12:19] <buzzman> someone plz tell me what's wrong with this?  >  $('a.lfpop').attr('rel','lightframe');
[14:12:20] <natrixnatrix89> but this one is using jquery.. and shows progress
[14:12:20] <uf0> regardless
[14:12:26] <natrixnatrix89> and is compatible with ie6
[14:12:30] <natrixnatrix89> how is that possible?
[14:12:52] <Cork[home]> buzzman: nothing
[14:12:59] <uf0> i could have margin-left: 1000px !important;
[14:13:03] <uf0> and though it does take it
[14:13:12] <uf0> it recalculates via js
[14:13:14] <uf0> so pointless
[14:13:15] <jeedey> natrixnatrix89
[14:13:18] <jeedey> you didnt read Microsoft Internet Explorer has no support for multiple file selection or upload progress.
[14:13:24] <uf0> which is why i need to put the number via JS
[14:13:26] <uf0> jquery
[14:13:35] <Lomex> danheberden: Wont this do it too? http://api.jquery.com/serialize/
[14:13:36] <buzzman> Cork[home]:  heh ... :p ... but looks like it's not working ...
[14:14:01] <danheberden> Lomex ya, just not as workable imo
[14:14:03] <jeedey> and if im not mistaken, it uses another jQuery plugin to automate the workarounds in other browsers that dont have FileAPI anyway
[14:14:08] <Cork[home]> buzzman: test the selector console.log($('a.lfpop').length);
[14:14:16] <Lomex> danheberden: Thats the so called json format right?
[14:14:27] <danheberden> Lomex still an object
[14:14:28] <Lomex> I mean that serializing you do
[14:14:36] <danheberden> nope, just makes an object
[14:14:38] <natrixnatrix89> jeedey: ok. you're right.. but then how come gmail file uploads show a progress bar on ie, but doesn't show it on other browsers?
[14:14:47] <danheberden> json _does_ represent a JS object
[14:14:48] <danheberden> but isn't the same thing
[14:14:50] <buzzman> Cork[home]:  k ... on it ... thnx ... btw, there was this online jquery validator ... know the url ... ?
[14:14:54] <Lomex> danheberden: I don't really understand how you mean it. How will the object be submitted by post?
[14:15:27] <danheberden> Lomex well, it'll be turned into a querystring by jquery
[14:15:35] <Cork[home]> buzzman: you mean jslint?, haven't seen any jquery specific
[14:15:49] <danheberden> &propName=value&propName[whatever]=what...
[14:15:51] <jeedey> natrixnatrix89: gmail has many highly paid developers who get free food and work in giant fun google offices..
[14:16:12] <natrixnatrix89> lol :D
[14:16:14] <Lomex> danheberden: Ah yes I just see it. I
[14:16:15] <natrixnatrix89> right
[14:16:21] <natrixnatrix89> that explains everything
[14:16:22] <buzzman> Cork[home]:  yup that's the one ... thnx again ... i first got that from this channel ...
[14:16:22] <Lomex> danheberden: That should do well, thanks sir
[14:17:06] <danheberden> natrixnatrix89 they use flash kiddo

[14:17:37] <danheberden> ffffffffuuuuuuuuuuuuu bot-t
[14:17:44] <natrixnatrix89> really?  dammit. that's lame.. flash..
[14:17:46] <danheberden> ?g plupload @ natrixnatrix89
[14:17:47] <bot-t> natrixnatrix89, Plupload - A tool for uploading files using Flash, Silverlight ... - http://www.plupload.com/
[14:17:50] <jeedey> yeah flash is another work around
[14:17:57] <jeedey> its flash or iframe for now
[14:18:00] <danheberden> natrixnatrix89 well when you want features that don't exist...
[14:18:02] <jeedey> til every browser gets FileAPI support
[14:18:13] <jeedey> which will be like... by next year probably, and never for older usere
[14:18:23] <natrixnatrix89> yeah. I've used plupload before.. but I just wanted to create sth on my own..
[14:18:32] <natrixnatrix89> for specific demands
[14:18:46] <natrixnatrix89> but if it's impossible, then ok. ill have to stick without that
[14:18:59] <uf0> danheberden: i need to use this somehow
[14:19:00] <uf0> http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Position
[14:19:06] <uf0> just don't know how
[14:19:09] <natrixnatrix89> but only in that case.. What exactly is jquery ui progressbar meant for?
[14:19:25] <danheberden> uf0 - that's a great util, but still just sets left/top
[14:19:37] <danheberden> natrixnatrix89 when you want to show progress?
[14:19:38] <danheberden> what do you mean?
[14:19:57] <danheberden> that's like saying "why did nike bother to make shoes when they don't run on their own"
[14:20:12] <natrixnatrix89> ok
[14:20:22] <natrixnatrix89> im just asking what is the main purpose for it..
[14:20:31] <natrixnatrix89> where do users mostly use it?
[14:20:41] <natrixnatrix89> if file uploads won't be the case..
[14:20:51] <uf0> danheberden: i'm fine with whatever numbers it's using i just need few pixels off
[14:20:53] <danheberden> progress of tasks? if i'm communicating with the server, multiple steps, etc
[14:20:59] <uf0> what's the best approach then
[14:21:06] <uf0> and i can't use position relative
[14:21:10] <danheberden> uf0 - cool, then ya - position will help you out
[14:21:36] <uf0> ok but i have no idea what
[14:21:39] <uf0> how it works
[14:21:42] <uf0> like what's
[14:21:49] <uf0> "left bottom"
[14:21:55] <uf0> i mean how can I put numbers in there
[14:22:18] <danheberden> natrixnatrix89 like - if i'm running a process that has to communicate with multiple services, it'd be cool that as each resolves, i could update a progress bar
[14:22:37] <buzzman> Cork[home]:  what i'm trying to do is this   >>>   on a page i have 3 links with the "rel" attribute. i'd like to attach the "rel" attribute to these 3 links with jQuery so   that it's NOT visible in the HTML, but should work ok when the link is actually clicked. what's the best way to do this?  itried doing this by the prev line of code ... but looks like the "rel" attached using jQuery is not the way to go since the lightbox code
[14:22:38] <danheberden> or if my node server is building something with workers, i could get a progress and report back
[14:23:40] <danheberden> uf0 - you just give it an object of what you want
[14:23:56] <danheberden> .position( { left: 450, top: 10 } );
[14:24:05] <danheberden> but you can use .position() as a getter, to get an object with .left and .top
[14:24:38] <danheberden> you can also do .css( 'left', "-=5" ) to subtract 5 from the current val
[14:24:43] <danheberden> += works too, as you can imagine
[14:25:50] <uf0> that css one looks like a simpler option
[14:25:54] <uf0> let me give that a shot
[14:26:07] <Cork[home]> buzzman: attr will only run on the first matched element, so you need to use each see ?.each
[14:26:08] <bot-t> buzzman, .each(function): Iterate over a jQuery object, executing a function for each matched element. http://api.jquery.com/each/
[14:26:10] <uf0> will that run after autocomplete does it's calculation?
[14:27:15] <buzzman> Cork[home]: yes, but to test i have that line of code and actually added the class "lfpop" to only 1 element for testing ... :(
[14:28:09] <Cork[home]> buzzman: ah, where are you running the code?
[14:28:46] <Cork[home]> btw what did the test return?
[14:28:52] <Cork[home]> (the console.log)
[14:29:02] <buzzman> Cork[home]: on the page, inside a script block is thae jQ code and then i added the class to an a element ...
[14:29:20] <buzzman> Cork[home]: 0
[14:29:23] <Cork[home]> buzzman: do you use the ready event?
[14:30:08] <Cork[home]> wrap your code with this => $(function() {});
[14:30:11] <uf0> danheberden: i just figured something out
[14:30:16] <uf0> i can use .offset as well right?
[14:31:10] <buzzman> Cork[home]: yes, but the ready event code is much below this piece of code though ... ok lemme try that wrap as u suggested ...
[14:31:34] <Cork[home]> buzzman: you can have the ready blocks multible times if you like
[14:31:46] <Cork[home]> but your code has to always work inside it
[14:32:05] <Cork[home]> buzzman: else the function will actually look for the dom element before it exists
[14:32:12] <buzzman> Cork[home]: k, so i'll put that code inside a ready event then ... ?
[14:32:17] <Cork[home]> ya
[14:32:37] <buzzman> Cork[home]: k ... on it ... gimme a sec plz ...
[14:34:17] <Cork[home]> buzzman: btw why are you adding the rel through js?
[14:36:27] <buzzman> Cork[home]:  yup that's a bit hackish isn't it ... ? well cuz the rel in the link's html is clashing with an auto lightshow that pops up on a certain time decay ... :(
[14:36:51] <Cork[home]> ouch
[14:37:42] <buzzman> Cork[home]:  so to test that this was the case, i just removed ALL the rels on ALL links and that clash was resolved ... so then i knew i had to use jquery for stealth rel attach ... he he ...
[14:38:19] <Cork[home]> buzzman: or you could fix your lightshow ;)
[14:38:35] <buzzman> Cork[home]: no actually double ouch cuz took me a while to figure out this baby ...
[14:39:19] <buzzman> Cork[home]:  fix as in how ? can u gimme an idea ... ?
[14:39:37] <Cork[home]> buzzman: no as i don't know how it fails
[14:39:46] <Cork[home]> never looked at lightshow
[14:40:41] <buzzman> Cork[home]:  oh no this is actually the stndard original lightbox code and lightshow is the lightbox mode for a slideshow inside the lightbox ...
[14:41:28] <buzzman> Cork[home]:  it's that js lightbox code adapted for Drupal ...
[14:42:09] <KyleSmithNew> Could my php file be taking ages to load because it loads jquery from the jquery website?
[14:42:34] <Cork[home]> KyleSmithNew: open the profiling console and see
[14:42:44] <buzzman> Cork[home]:  i think that the clash is happening cuz the code is queuing the lightframe objects along with the lightshow objects ...
[14:42:46] <systemfault> KyleSmithNew: What do you mean? The google CDN?
[14:43:01] <KyleSmithNew> I use this:
[14:43:03] <KyleSmithNew> <script type="text/javascript" src="http://code.jquery.com/jquery-latest.js"></script>
[14:43:12] <systemfault> KyleSmithNew: Don't do that.
[14:43:20] <KyleSmithNew> Whats up with it?
[14:43:49] <buzzman> KyleSmithNew: only after php finishes processing does the page load the JS stuff and that too at the client's browser ...
[14:44:11] <systemfault> KyleSmithNew: That link is to download jquery, not really meant to be used as a CDN.
[14:44:24] <systemfault> KyleSmithNew: http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.6.2/jquery.min.js
[14:46:13] <KyleSmithNew> whats the difference?
[14:46:28] <Cork[home]> KyleSmithNew: the code isn't a distributed service
[14:46:46] <Cork[home]> its not meant for the load of loading for each visitor to x number of sites
[14:47:19] <KyleSmithNew> oh right okay
[14:58:34] <buzzman> Cork[home]:  now i get the test value as 1 in console.log ... but the lightframe rel is pro'ly not getting picked up by the lightbox code ...
[14:59:05] <Cork[home]> Badababuba: fix your freeking connection
[14:59:34] <buzzman> Badababuba:  nice nick ... :)
[14:59:47] <Cork[home]> buzzman: ya, as it prob search the dom from the ready event too, and triggers before your code
[15:00:40] <buzzman> Cork[home]:  yup ur spot on ... any idea how i can have this func load bfor the lightbox func loads in the dom ... ?
[15:01:13] <Cork[home]> buzzman: try put the block before the loading of the lightbox file
[15:01:21] <Cork[home]> but after the jquery file
[15:02:11] <buzzman> Cork[home]: hmm ... that's gonna b tricky ... the whole freakin header is generated by Drupal ... :)
[15:02:45] <Cork[home]> buzzman: ya... good luck :)
[15:02:56] <buzzman> tanks ... :)
[15:03:15] <Cork[home]> buzzman: you can search the script array and insert your script as its own file though
[15:03:40] <Cork[home]> at least that was posible back in d6, not sure its doable in 7
[15:03:58] <buzzman> Cork[home]:  yup, that's gotta b th plan ... nothing else comes to mind ...
[15:04:22] <buzzman> Cork[home]:  i'm on D6 ... hallelujah ... ;-)
[15:04:43] <Cork[home]> buzzman: or you can add your code at the top of the lightbox file ;)
[15:05:24] <buzzman> Cork[home]; that's even better ... much less work ...
[15:05:49] <Cork[home]> buzzman: but much more hackish
[15:06:00] <Cork[home]> as it will make it harder to update your plugins
[15:07:13] <buzzman> Cork[home]:  totally hackish ... i agree ... but i mark ALL updated code ... and find em all in 1 search ...
[15:08:33] <buzzman> Cork[home]:  gonna try this now ... thnx a heavy bunch ... :)
[15:08:45] <buzzman> Cork[home]++
[15:08:51] <buzzman> :)
[15:09:52] <chabz> is there a way to enable an input filter programmatically?
[15:09:57] <chabz> sorry, wrong channel
[15:15:58] <uf0> guys I want to use use this
[15:16:00] <uf0> $( ".selector" ).autocomplete({ position: { my : "right top", at: "right bottom" } });
[15:16:18] <uf0> how do i set that above to 9 pixels to left
[15:17:46] <ajpiano> uf0, use the "offset" option to the position
[15:18:14] <ajpiano> and change the my and at
[15:18:17] <ajpiano> like
[15:18:45] <ajpiano> {my: "right bottom", at: "right top", offset: "-9 0"}
[15:23:39] <uf0> err it's not working
[15:23:49] <uf0> this remains as is
[15:23:51] <uf0> left: 1467px;
[15:27:06] <uf0> ajpiano: i simply want to move position and it's becoming a pain to do
[15:27:36] <uf0> i tried
[15:27:37] <uf0> $( ".selector" ).autocomplete( "option", "position", { my : "right top", at: "right bottom" } );
[15:27:42] <uf0> and nada
[15:28:30] <ajpiano> uh, you said you wanted it above, and you didn't swap the values as i instructed
[15:28:47] <ajpiano> if you want to put it above the thing, you have to positon "my bottom" to "the top" of the other thing
[15:31:56] <uf0> let me do a jsfiddle so you can see.
[15:37:49] <uf0> ajpiano: look at it here
[15:37:51] <uf0> http://jsfiddle.net/xvVKW/113/
[15:37:57] <uf0> the position remains the same
[15:38:15] <uf0> i'm obviously doing something wrong
[15:40:18] <ajpiano> uf0 is this what you're after? http://jsfiddle.net/xvVKW/114/
[15:40:27] <ajpiano> above it and 9px to the left?
[15:40:30] <buzzman> Cork[home]:  put the code on top of lightbox file but after jQuery loads ... test returns 1 ok ... but the rel is not being picked up by lightbox onclick ... :-(
[15:40:58] <ajpiano> there would be no reason whatsoever for setting the option on the fly after
[15:41:04] <ajpiano> and you weren't selecting the right element to apply the option to
[15:41:21] <ajpiano> .ui-autocomplete is not applied to the input to which the autocomplete is applied, the class it applies is ui-autocomplete-input
[15:41:45] <buzzman> Cork[home]:  dunno what else to do ... this is nuts ...
[15:42:05] <uf0> ajpiano: yes thank you very much
[15:42:11] <ajpiano> :)
[15:48:40] <uf0> finally :)
[15:56:01] <khaan> hi everybody. I'm having an issue with jQuery.load() - i should load a page fragment and the whole page gets loaded instead

[16:13:56] <blup> stupid js question... is there a way of continuing a chain after a split()? (using the array's index 0)
[16:14:02] <Sora_> hiya ppl

[16:14:32] <Sora_> .split()[0]
[16:14:40] <Sora_> hi hi Enginoob

[16:16:51] <blup> neither a.attribs.href.split('&')[0]substr(15) nor a.attribs.href.split('&')[0].substr(15) are working for me..
[16:17:00] <Sora_> blup
[16:17:02] <Sora_> put in ()
[16:17:26] <Sora_> (a.attribs.href.split('&')[0]).substr(15)

[16:20:52] <blup> :)
[16:22:23] <blup> i used to be a php man, but nodejs has converted me to js... such an interesting language
[16:23:14] <blup> feels a bit hacky sometimes, but i like hacky
[16:23:25] <Enginoob> I used to be a c man... but common sense converted me to anything else
[16:23:49] <blup> good point
[16:24:20] <Sora_> lol me too
[16:24:25] <Sora_> but now only c#
[16:24:34] <Enginoob> c# is pimp
[16:24:44] <blup> i think i only tried c out for a text-based game in high school
[16:24:53] <Sora_> haha is for .net
[16:25:00] <blup> nevermind, it was c++
[16:25:02] <Sora_> aspx and ms sql server
[16:25:19] <Enginoob> Sora_: mssql is of the devil
[16:25:24] <Sora_> hahahaha
[16:25:42] <Enginoob> blup: c++ is just a nice version of C
[16:25:55] <blup> i've heard
[16:26:14] <Enginoob> vanilla c is shit.  had to learn it for an os class
[16:26:32] <blup> i prefer stuff that gives me visual results quick.. or i get bored
[16:26:33] <Jee5us> Hey, guys! Can anyone tell me or give me advise when I want to detect if multiple keys are pressed at one. for example left and down arrow at the same time. I can get when one keys is pressed, but when i press another key too, then the prevous key code will be canceled and the new one will be used. Thanks in advance
[16:26:52] <Sora_> save in array ?
[16:27:19] <Sora_> on realease remove from array ?
[16:27:19] <Enginoob> lol
[16:27:23] <Sora_> xD
[16:28:27] <Jee5us> yea I thought of it but i figured that maybe there is a better way...but I suppose it makes no difference
[16:28:51] <Sora_> i like the new interface of youtube
[16:30:30] <Enginoob> Yeah, not bad.
[16:38:19] <Enginoob> so.. I've gotta have something done for work tomorrow morning.
[16:38:57] <Enginoob> I wanna stick a modal in a click event, but the calendar app that the guy wrote is a little confusing.
[16:38:58] <Enginoob> http://arshaw.com/fullcalendar/docs/mouse/eventClick/
[16:39:21] <Enginoob> The code at the bottom.
[16:39:42] <Enginoob> Instead of the silly window.open, how do I do something custom?
[16:39:56] <Enginoob> can I just go ahead and do a full function inside that one?
[16:40:15] <atxq> I am trying to replace "name" with "<b>name</b>" throughout the whole page
[16:40:51] <Vorspire> oh, how's that going for you then, atxq?
[16:40:53] <Sora_> yep obviusly
[16:41:02] <Sora_> Enginoob
[16:41:30] <Enginoob> Sora_: be easy on me, I haven't doen much jquery yet ;)
[16:41:36] <Enginoob> done*
[16:41:37] <Sora_> ohh ok ok
[16:41:40] <atxq> wondering if someone knew a quick solution to replace text on a page?
[16:41:51] <Enginoob> so would that be like...
[16:42:38] <Sora_> atxq: u need replace in one place ?
[16:43:01] <Enginoob> eventClick: function(event) { $('#calendar a').function(e) { //my stuff here } }?
[16:43:04] <atxq> would like to specify the id and replace all the matches within that container
[16:43:21] <Sora_> yes Enginoob
[16:43:28] <Sora_> yes
[16:43:32] <Enginoob> Thank you :)
[16:43:45] <Sora_> atxq: $('#youid').text('you text');
[16:44:22] <atxq> I want to match/replace text, not change the text of a container
[16:44:38] <Sora_> ohh ok ok
[16:44:42] <Sora_> well then use regex
[16:44:45] <Sora_> 1 sec
[16:45:25] <atxq> I have a working example, but still working out some bugs. was wondering if someone knew a simple solution for this?
[16:47:17] <Sora_> atxq: http://jsfiddle.net/Sora/z8UU6/
[16:47:20] <Sora_> check
[16:47:49] <Sora_> is ok ?
[16:48:08] <jrockjiggz> $(this).text($(this).text().replace('Subject:','Name:'));
[16:51:00] <atxq> both examples work here
[16:51:13] <atxq> and are shorter than the one I am struggling with
[16:51:16] <atxq> thats guys
[16:51:26] <Sora_> but use regex if u need more replaces
[16:51:46] <Sora_> http://jsfiddle.net/Sora/z8UU6/
[16:52:13] <atxq> thansk Sora_
[16:52:34] <Sora_> yep check now
[16:52:37] <Sora_> http://jsfiddle.net/Sora/z8UU6/
[16:52:43] <atxq> regex is awesome
[16:53:07] <Sora_> ^^;
[16:54:40] <GoGoGarrett> Yeah it is
[17:00:23] <mystline> Hi. I need to draw basic lines & if possible, boxes ontop of an image using jQuery
[17:00:32] <mystline> I am thinking of using raphael.js
[17:00:38] <mystline> are there any other better solutions?
[17:04:39] <Seldon75> I am (obviously) new to jquery, but when I call $('#foo') for an element that isn't on the page, I get an empty array '[]' instead of 'undefined'
[17:04:45] <Seldon75> is that true?
[17:05:53] <jrist-out> jQuery selectors always return a jquery object
[17:06:50] <tbranyen> Seldon75: allows you to do stuff $(".dont-exist").click(function() { }); without erroring out
[17:06:59] <tbranyen> if you want to test for existence use .length
[17:07:04] <tbranyen> $('.no-exist').length == 0
[17:07:12] <Seldon75> ah I see
[17:07:13] <Seldon75> ok thanks
[17:07:27] <tbranyen> Seldon75: np
[17:07:49] <Seldon75> although, idealogically, I would argue that you want an error to be thrown under that circumstance
[17:07:54] <tbranyen> Seldon75: its convenient to do stuff like if( $('something').length )
[17:07:54] <Seldon75> but I'll keep trying this out
[17:07:59] <tbranyen> Seldon75: thats not the jQuery way
[17:08:01] <jrist-out> Seldon75: right but that's up to you
[17:08:24] <Seldon75> jury is still out
[17:08:40] <jrist-out> lol
[17:08:46] <tbranyen> Seldon75: querySelectorAll which is a standard does not return undefined
[17:09:04] <tbranyen> getElementsByTagName does not return undefined
[17:09:13] <tbranyen> and neither should jQuery, there is no jury
[17:09:24] <tbranyen> its just common sense best practices
[17:12:30] <opra> Hi, i am using jquery to submit a form, however, i have multiple submit buttons, each that I want to pass params to the submit and give the server different information, what s the best way to accomplish this
[17:12:43] <Bretsky> Does anyone know of an expanding code box that has support for a good amount of languages syntax-wise
[17:13:16] <Bretsky> opra: you can assign name/values to submit buttons
[17:13:45] <Enginoob> Sora_: can you get me started on this?  I'm sorta struggling.  I just want a jqueryui modal to pop up with some content.
[17:14:30] <opra> Bretsky: but then how do i attach clicks on those buttons to submit the form with the new params?
[17:15:30] <Sora_> uhm
[17:15:40] <Sora_> let me see i dont know mucho from jquery ui
[17:15:57] <Enginoob> okay, boxy, or qtip..
[17:15:58] <Enginoob> anything
[17:16:17] <Enginoob> I just need a non-invasive way of popping up some text using his eventClick handler
[17:16:44] <Sora_> but u are using jquery ui ?
[17:16:52] <Enginoob> nope, the calendar app is using jquery
[17:17:00] <Enginoob> but I'm not using the ui at all
[17:17:02] <Sora_> oh ok ok
[17:26:38] <gopus> anyone know of any reasons why serialize() may not work in IE8, while working in Firefox?
[17:40:20] <inMOTION> question.  Is it possible to recreate the time/delay fade in effect such as enter screen of www.wa007.com solely with jquery?
[17:42:33] <gopus> Okay...
[17:42:37] <gopus> Different question...
[17:42:56] <gopus> why might serialize() not work in IE when it comes to SELECTs?
[17:51:53] <Nebbie> IE javascript is way more picky.. too many variables that can root to the problem
[18:08:08] <gopus> how strange...
[18:09:05] <gopus> Nebbie: if in IE, I use tables to organize the form, and if in that form there is a select field, there is no serialization within the table.
[18:09:19] <gopus> that doesn't make sense I am doing soemthing wrong.
[18:40:23] <Seldon75> can anyone take a look at this:
[18:40:24] <Seldon75> http://jsfiddle.net/blackfrancis75/vtUGT/
[18:40:40] <Seldon75> my draggable won't come 'outside' the containing div
[18:40:48] <Seldon75> i guess because of overflow
[18:41:10] <Seldon75> is there a way to achieve this?
[18:42:10] <sveisvei> Anyone know of a good article about cross domain iframe messaging?
[18:50:42] <gopus> Seldon75: let me give it a try
[18:50:50] <Seldon75> wait
[18:50:53] <Seldon75> i think I have it
[18:51:03] <Seldon75> http://jsfiddle.net/blackfrancis75/vtUGT/5/
[18:51:29] <Seldon75> thanks though
[18:52:12] <mekwall> Seldon75: was just about to suggest that myself :)
[18:52:19] <mekwall> good you found it out
[18:52:35] <gopus> Seldon: what'd you do?
[18:52:53] <gopus> ahh containment
[18:52:55] <gopus> makes sense
[18:53:02] <Seldon75> yeah
[18:53:14] <Seldon75> i think I need all of those params
[18:53:17] <Seldon75> except for 'revert'
[18:53:22] <mekwall> sveisvei: my good friend cowboy have a nice article on that.... http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-postmessage-plugin/
[18:53:57] <mekwall> gopus: containment isnt enough, you need to clone and append to body as well
[18:54:11] <halo> Hi all!
[18:54:20] <gopus> mekwall: that would make sense as well
[18:54:22] <gopus> :-P
[18:55:06] <mekwall> halo: halo!
[18:55:24] <halo> mekwall: :P
[18:55:52] <halo> Can someone help me now with small bug which I discovered while coding?
[18:56:06] <mekwall> post it and you'll see :)
[18:56:28] <halo> Okay I'll go smoke and be back soon :)
[18:57:07] <gopus> ...
[18:57:10] <gopus> lol
[18:57:24] <mekwall> \o/
[18:57:46] <gopus> i've no idea what that set of characters mean
[18:58:47] <mekwall> gopus: it means DEATH....
[18:59:02] <mekwall> or rather, a happy guy with his hands up high :)
[18:59:14] <mekwall> HOORAY!
[19:02:08] <halo> Okay the problem is in autoloading recaptcha via jquery. I am using cakephp framework and I've created controller site.com/captcha which has methods show() and check() (so they are available at site.com/captcha/show and site.com/captcha/check/hereiscaptcha)
[19:02:43] <halo> So I'm using jquery method replaceWith() to replace some mark with recaptcha
[19:03:15] <mekwall> and the bug is?
[19:03:19] <halo> But it's not replaced correctly, the recaptcha code is here: http://pastebin.com/CmH8VGz8
[19:03:52] <halo> When I remove noscript tag with firebug all is ok (but there no any colors or something like that)
[19:04:43] <halo> And replaceWith() method has parameter which is variable which contains ajax response code from site.com/captcha/show
[19:04:57] <halo> You can see this code in pastebin link above
[19:06:03] <halo> So what am I doing wrong with recaptcha? Maybe I should link something because script code which is firstly goes isn't works as I see
[19:06:30] <halo> And if I go directly to site.com/captcha/show all is work
[19:06:38] <halo> All colors are correct and so on
[19:06:50] <mekwall> halo: need a test case
[19:06:52] <LostyJai> hey
[19:07:04] <halo> Wait a bit I'll show you some screenshots
[19:07:30] <LostyJai> is it possible prevent .load() from set the returned HTML into the element?
[19:07:37] <LostyJai> setting*
[19:08:56] <halo> Wait a bit pls :) Making screenshots and you can see what happens.
[19:09:17] <mekwall> halo: screenshots doesn't help that much... cant you setup a test case that shows what happens?
[19:09:20] <mekwall> show*
[19:09:50] <mekwall> LostyJai: what do you mean?
[19:11:27] <LostyJai> $('#result').load('script.php');
[19:11:51] <LostyJai> that will return the result of 'script.php' and store it in the tag with id 'results'
[19:11:52] <LostyJai> yes?
[19:12:07] <mekwall> LostyJai: yes... that's how it works
[19:12:13] <mekwall> and how its supposed to work
[19:12:14] <LostyJai> can i stop it from doing that?
[19:12:22] <LostyJai> maybe i should use ajax then...
[19:12:23] <mekwall> not by using load :)
[19:12:28] <LostyJai> hahaha
[19:12:31] <mekwall> load is already using ajax
[19:12:39] <mekwall> its just a shortcut
[19:12:41] <LostyJai> because i'm doing a loop of these 'load()'
[19:12:47] <LostyJai> and i want to append the results
[19:12:58] <LostyJai> to the same tag
[19:13:03] <mekwall> $.get("script.php", function(data) { ... });
[19:13:11] <LostyJai> get eh...
[19:13:32] <mekwall> ?tias
[19:13:32] <bot-t> Try It And See
[19:13:33] <mekwall> :D
[19:13:41] <LostyJai> will do ;)
[19:13:43] <LostyJai> thx
[19:15:25] <halo> Here is jquery code of replace: http://pastebin.com/GtYmfsfF
[19:15:36] <halo> And here are screenshots: http://www.sendspace.com/file/ntux3p
[19:15:46] <halo> And I'll try now load method
[19:16:39] <mekwall> halo: dude...
[19:16:43] <mekwall> async :(
[19:17:08] <halo> And load not works to :(
[19:17:32] <halo> Yep, async. Because of this is dialog()
[19:17:45] <mekwall> then you are doing it wrong
[19:17:49] <mekwall> http://jsfiddle.net/mekwall/a8u9U/
[19:17:55] <mekwall> you should do something like that
[19:18:05] <mekwall> use the callback to your advantage
[19:18:07] <Vorspire> either set ajax option "async" to false or put: $('#registration_captcha').replaceWith(captcha); inside your success callback :/
[19:18:28] <mekwall> Vorspire: already ahead of you :p
[19:18:35] <halo> With load I don't use async ofcaurse so I removed my previous code to compact load now :) Thnx for this. But the bug is already exists
[19:19:18] <mekwall> halo: dont think its a bug... but rather that you are doing something wrong :)
[19:19:19] <Vorspire> it's a totally avoidable bug though... why leave it?
[19:19:32] <Vorspire> it's not a jquery bug for sure :P
[19:20:08] <halo> mekwall: Vorspire: Yep but I cannot understand why if I go directly to /captcha/show all is working. But if I use jquery loading not all so good :(
[19:20:42] <Vorspire> halo, we both explained why
[19:20:51] <halo> Now it's the next code: http://pastebin.com/bCmyusLd
[19:21:01] <halo> But bug is exists :(
[19:21:24] <halo> So maybe jquery filter some those script tags or something like that?
[19:21:59] <mekwall> halo: isnt a /captcha/show delivering a whole html document with scripts and css etc?
[19:22:07] <mekwall> yes
[19:22:12] <Vorspire> umm, any html document loaded with an ajax request is not guaranteed to return the sme as if it were viewed by a browser (it says exactly this in the docs)
[19:22:15] <mekwall> halo: you cannot load scripts ...
[19:22:24] <Vorspire> s/sme/same
[19:22:38] <Vorspire> you can load scripts :D $.getScript
[19:22:45] <mekwall> halo: just use an iframe?
[19:22:56] <mekwall> Vorspire: not the same P
[19:23:15] <halo> Yes iframe is in noscript tags but if I manually remove noscript all css and scripts are not working as well
[19:23:21] <Vorspire> I guess "script" is a pretty ambiguous reference then lol
[19:23:38] <halo> And .getScript will return html to?
[19:23:41] <mekwall> no
[19:23:49] <mekwall> halo: you are doing it wrong
[19:23:55] <mekwall> you need to rethink what you are trying to do
[19:24:06] <LostyJai> thanks mekwall
[19:24:08] <LostyJai> worked =)
[19:24:18] <mekwall> LostyJai: you're welcome :)
[19:24:22] <halo> So I need to load both script and noscript containers like it works in directly output
[19:25:02] <mekwall> halo: where is the output /captcha/show coming from?
[19:25:14] <mekwall> there has to be a script you can modify yes?
[19:25:48] <mekwall> just add some stuff to it, that if it's an xhr request, return only the parts you need (only html)
[19:26:02] <mekwall> do whatever scripting necessary in the callback
[19:28:07] <halo> So the story is more harder than it looks like :) The controller uses pear package if ReCaptcha
[19:29:00] <halo> And what do you mean at output of /captcha/show? This is call of controllers method through mod_rewrite
[19:30:25] <Vorspire> Captcha is overrated imo
[19:31:54] <halo> Oh see what I've googled: http://bit.ly/mTHzud
[19:32:21] <bencahill> hey guys, I want to have a div be hidden or shown depending on which radio button in a form is selected...
[19:32:42] <halo> Someone on stackoverflow asked already this question. I'll check it out after some sleeping and anyway thx for .load method and help :P If nothing will work I'll come again!
[19:33:20] <bencahill> I've got this so far, but it doesn't always work, can someone take a look? http://paste.pocoo.org/show/435754/
[19:35:29] <DofLeFou> Anyone seen JQuery God arround?
[19:35:50] <DofLeFou> I had a question to ask
[19:36:25] <mekwall> DofLeFou: I'm jquery jesus, but you can call me jj :P
[19:36:40] <smik``> How can I trigger an even onchange of a contenteditable? Will jQuery's Onchange work?
[19:37:08] <mekwall> smik``: you'd probably want to use keydown, keyup or keypress
[19:37:09] <ryanseddon> smik``: there is no onchange event for contenteditable
[19:37:20] <halo> bencahill: Use something like $('input:checked') pseudoselector in if() and $('#somediv').show() method to open hidden div
[19:37:32] <smik``> Those are ugly mekwall , what if the user uses the mouse to change the text?
[19:37:53] <mekwall> smik``: ugly?
[19:37:59] <mekwall> then bind the mouse events as well
[19:38:18] <bencahill> halo: is that not what I've done?
[19:38:35] <smik``> mekwall: There is no `write less' solution?
[19:38:36] <ryanseddon> smik``: you could also listen for mutation events on content editable element
[19:38:39] <DofLeFou> mekwall: heheheh
[19:38:55] <mekwall> smik``: no
[19:39:03] <mekwall> smik``: that is the write less solution :)
[19:39:15] <smik``> mekwall: Very well :)
[19:39:25] <DofLeFou> mekwall: I have the following table http://jsfiddle.net/ssnV2/6/
[19:39:51] <halo> bencahill: Oh yes. Maybe I really need to have some sleep
[19:39:57] <halo> Bye all!
[19:40:00] <bencahill> halo: hehe
[19:40:03] <bencahill> :(
[19:40:05] <DofLeFou> I m trying to figure for the selected row, how to get the value of the tr > .index
[19:40:20] <DofLeFou> td > .index
[19:40:22] <bencahill> hmm, can anyone else look at this for me? http://paste.pocoo.org/show/435754/
[19:40:52] <DofLeFou> my issue is I m declaring var id = $('.Index').val();
[19:41:15] <DofLeFou> but it always picks the td > .index
[19:41:55] <mekwall> smik``: http://jsfiddle.net/mekwall/jQWc6/ <-- isn't that light enough?
[19:42:17] <mekwall> smik``: just keep a copy of the original and then compare to see if something was changes
[19:42:23] <mekwall> s/d
[19:42:53] <smik``> mekwall: Don't you think the `up' events would be more appropriate ?
[19:43:09] <mekwall> smik``: doesn't fire properly for everything
[19:43:41] <mekwall> smik``: let me rephrase.. it fires properly, but won't catch everything :)
[19:44:53] <smik``> mekwall: But say I press a key, the keydown will fire, I'll check for change in text, there would be no change till now, because the key is just pressed, and then when it will be up, the text will actually change, but my handler will miss that.
[19:45:08] <mekwall> DofLeFou: you have multiple .Index
[19:45:15] <mekwall> DofLeFou: .val() will only return the first
[19:45:23] <mekwall> DofLeFou: so you'll have to be more specific in the selector
[19:46:00] <DofLeFou> mekwall: how would a rookie do that?
[19:46:03] <mekwall> DofLeFou: why not use this.value ?
[19:46:24] <DofLeFou> will that do it?
[19:46:31] <mekwall> DofLeFou: http://jsfiddle.net/mekwall/ssnV2/7/
[19:47:14] <mekwall> DofLeFou: { "id":"ba"} :)
[19:47:22] <mekwall> when I removed r from bar
[19:47:45] <mekwall> DofLeFou: is that what you wanted?
[19:48:47] <DofLeFou> hold on i m testing it
[19:49:28] <mekwall> smik``: true... that's why you need to check what key is pressed etc.
[19:49:54] <smik``> mekwall: Ugh, okay.
[19:49:58] <mekwall> smik``: its a problem I faced when coding my google-type-ahead
[19:50:23] <mekwall> smik``:
[19:50:29] <mekwall> meh.. http://jsfiddle.net/mekwall/QY7AM/
[19:51:02] <mekwall> smik``: type apple :P
[19:51:27] <smik``> Neat
[19:51:28] <smik``> Very nice
[19:51:36] <mekwall> still buggy
[19:51:39] <smik``> Yes
[19:51:41] <mekwall> just a concept :P
[19:51:43] <smik``> saw one bug
[19:51:48] <mekwall> there's loads of them
[19:52:20] <mekwall> but you need to use keydown to be able to do the more or less realtime type-ahead
[19:52:32] <smik``> But you used a Input box right or a contenteditable?
[19:52:36] <DofLeFou> mekwall: it is coming back as 'undefined'
[19:52:49] <mekwall> DofLeFou: when?
[19:53:21] <DofLeFou> mekwall: this right here data: '{ "id":"' + this.value + '"
[19:53:36] <mekwall> DofLeFou: it shouldnt... it didnt when I tried in the fiddle
[19:53:42] <DofLeFou> i sending 'id' as undefined
[19:53:52] <mekwall> weird
[19:54:15] <mekwall> DofLeFou: http://jsfiddle.net/mekwall/ssnV2/8/
[19:54:18] <mekwall> check that
[19:54:47] <bencahill> hey guys, can someone look at this and see what's wrong? the div should hide and show: http://jsfiddle.net/LWpVC/
[19:55:53] <DofLeFou> mekwall: .. i m trying to get the value of the follwing hidden field <input value="1457" type="hidden" class="Index
[19:56:09] <DofLeFou> i meant for the corresponding selected tr
[19:57:00] <smik``> mekwall: With a Textarea, I can use the jQuery change right?
[19:59:07] <mekwall> DofLeFou: http://jsfiddle.net/mekwall/ssnV2/9/
[19:59:14] <mekwall> not very nice... but it works
[19:59:20] <mekwall> you'd might want to cache that in some way
[20:01:45] <mekwall> smik``: sure... all form elements
[20:02:02] <smik``> mekwall: Hmm, seems like I'll use that for the current work then.
[20:02:15] <smik``> But I think we should write some library for contenteditable
[20:02:18] <smik``> or some plugin
[20:02:26] <bencahill> anyone? I'd think this would be simple...
[20:02:35] <DofLeFou> mekwell: var id = $(this).parent().prev().children("input").val();
[20:02:44] <mekwall> bencahill: it is hiding and showing on banana
[20:03:00] <bencahill> mekwall: try this: load, then select apple, then banana...
[20:03:14] <DofLeFou> what are you passing class="Index"
[20:03:26] <mekwall> bencahill: works just fine in chrome/webkit
[20:03:32] <bencahill> mekwall: oh?
[20:03:35] * bencahill tries
[20:03:42] <DofLeFou> how would that know that we are trying to get the value where class="Index"
[20:04:20] <mekwall> DofLeFou: because we are using this as starting-point
[20:04:53] <DofLeFou> meaning
[20:04:54] <mekwall> $(this).parent() <-- will move up to the li... .prev() will move to previous li
[20:05:01] <mekwall> and then finding the input inside that li
[20:05:11] <mekwall> its a pretty crappy chain if you ask me, but it picks the one you are after
[20:05:15] <bencahill> mekwall: dumb opera...weird
[20:05:21] <DofLeFou> haaa
[20:05:34] <bencahill> mekwall: any idea why it doesn't work on opera?
[20:05:36] <mekwall> bencahill: probably the selector that is not fully compatible
[20:06:31] <DofLeFou> well i ve summarize a a litlle my actual ... there are actual 6 tr in between them
[20:07:04] <DofLeFou> can parent().prev() be given ... how far we want to go back
[20:08:33] <bencahill> mekwall: anything I can do differently? I'm really surprised something so simple doesn't work in opera :-/
[20:08:43] <mekwall> bencahill: http://jsfiddle.net/mekwall/LWpVC/1/
[20:08:48] <mekwall> how about that? :)
[20:08:55] <mekwall> using native checks
[20:08:55] * bencahill looks
[20:09:12] <bencahill> mekwall: sweet!
[20:09:17] <bencahill> mekwall: will that work in ie?
[20:09:23] <mekwall> bencahill: it should
[20:09:34] <bencahill> mekwall: sweet, thank you so much! :-P
[20:09:41] <mekwall> hehe np :)
[20:10:04] <mekwall> bencahill: and yes, it is simple.. you are just overcomplicating things haha
[20:10:24] <mekwall> when jquerying its easy to get stuck in using only jquery methods
[20:10:41] <bencahill> mekwall: not surprised, I always run into all sorts of ridiculously simple problems working with js ;)
[20:10:53] <mekwall> well.. think occams razor
[20:10:59] <DofLeFou> mekwall: http://jsfiddle.net/ssnV2/10/
[20:11:16] <bencahill> mekwall: yes :)
[20:11:26] <mekwall> DofLeFou: that's a whole different beef!
[20:12:11] <mekwall> DofLeFou: var id = $(this).closest("tr").find("input.Index").val();
[20:13:56] <mekwall> anyways, gotta run
[20:20:46] <DofLeFou> mekwall: thank you
[20:20:53] <DofLeFou> it works
[20:21:12] <DofLeFou> I added : var id = $(this).closest("tr").find("#Index").val();
[20:21:22] <DofLeFou> change the class to id
[20:21:32] <DofLeFou> and it it grabbing it

[22:50:08] <Innocentus> hi
[22:50:27] <Innocentus> I want to sequentially preload a set of placed image tags
[22:50:32] <Innocentus> how can I do this with JQuery?
[22:50:35] <Innocentus> eager to know
[22:51:11] <jrockjiggz> ?g preload img with jquery
[22:51:12] <bot-t> jrockjiggz, Preloading Images with jQuery | Matt Farina - http://www.mattfarina.com/2007/02/01/preloading_images_with_jquery
[22:54:06] <Innocentus> jrockjiggz: well, yes this would preload them, maybe even sequentially
[22:54:26] <Innocentus> jrockjiggz: but what to do if the user clicks an image on the thumbnail pane which is not in order?
[22:54:43] <jrockjiggz> then it would not be loaded yet
[22:54:44] <Innocentus> jrockjiggz: then the preloader needs to stop and repriorize the sequence starting at the position
[22:55:00] <Innocentus> jrockjiggz: but this has to be avoided at all chances
[22:55:14] <Innocentus> jrockjiggz: I mean to avoid that it is not loaded yet
[22:55:17] <jrockjiggz> yes you would have to make it dynamic by getting the indexOf position on selected element
[22:55:57] <Innocentus> jrockjiggz: ok, but are there any preloaders which are sequential _and_ being able to be changed in loading index offset?
[22:56:24] <jrockjiggz> not sure
[22:56:29] <Innocentus> jrockjiggz: and somehow the currently running image download has to be stopped, because it would slow down the download of the newly requested image
[22:57:11] <Innocentus> jrockjiggz: additionally I would like to use an exisiting progressbar jquery component, so a hook is needed
[22:57:28] <Innocentus> jrockjiggz: I guess the best thing for this would be to create an own preload jquery plugin, right?
[22:57:39] <jrockjiggz> yes sonds like it
[22:58:04] <Innocentus> jrockjiggz: is there a more elegant alternative to arrays in jquery?
[22:58:14] <jrockjiggz> no
[22:58:23] <jrockjiggz> javascript is pretty good
[22:59:27] <jrockjiggz> you actually might benefit from getting into delegations.. i'm not too familiar with it, but it can listen very well
[23:01:15] <Innocentus> ok
[23:01:18] <Innocentus> delegations
[23:01:20] <Innocentus> thank you
[23:07:45] <djQuery> martk the images as loading? add a class that marks them slightly trasparent? mark them as ready as it finishes?
[23:08:59] <jrockjiggz> what is $('li', $('ul')[0] ) ?
[23:09:20] <djQuery> jrockjiggz: crap
[23:09:53] <djQuery> find the first li, then go look at all the li's
[23:10:26] <systemfault> s/first li/first ul
[23:11:01] <djQuery> no thats all li of the first ul
[23:11:10] <jrockjiggz> yes
[23:11:31] <jrockjiggz> but what is the point when you can just ul:first li
[23:11:42] <djQuery> :first is goanna be slow
[23:11:44] <systemfault> jrockjiggz: The guy didn't know.
[23:12:09] <djQuery> and remember that the sizzle works from right to left so it first finds all li
[23:12:13] <jrockjiggz> no its from an example of delegate, where you can get live to behave like delegate by selection as such
[23:12:19] <jrockjiggz> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23Q4S9hmHQY
[23:12:33] <Innocentus> other question: I am currently requesting the page without a preloader and then the images aren't downloaded
[23:12:34] <systemfault> jrockjiggz: Sure, both live and delegate do the same thing.
[23:12:44] <jrockjiggz> this video shows otherwise
[23:12:54] <Innocentus> I am using the AnythingSlider JQuery plugin, but this shouldn't be the reason for this strange behaviour, or does it?
[23:12:58] <jrockjiggz> just trying to wrap my understandings
[23:13:19] <systemfault> jrockjiggz: Watching
[23:13:40] <jrockjiggz> its to listen only with items, instead of bubbling up through the doc
[23:14:02] <systemfault> jrockjiggz: Both .live and .delegate use event delegation.
[23:15:38] <systemfault> jrockjiggz: You should have told us that you were talking about .live when you asked for what was $('li', $('ul')[0] )
[23:16:57] <jrockjiggz> i didn't think it mattered
[23:17:05] <systemfault> It does
[23:18:13] <systemfault> That video is good.
[23:18:36] <systemfault> Pretty much says what I told you, .live and .delegate do the same thing.
[23:18:46] <jrockjiggz> i guess attaching the handler to the DOM element is better than attaching to the document
[23:18:57] <systemfault> jrockjiggz: Faster.
[23:18:59] <r500> http://ecovillagegreen.com/903/what-do-the-plastic-recycling-numbers-mean/
[23:19:26] <systemfault> jrockjiggz: The closest is the "context" node in the tree, the better
[23:19:34] <jrockjiggz> I thought $('li') was attaching to the DOM element..
[23:19:44] <quizme> is there a way to fire an event whenever an <li> gets added to the DOM ?
[23:20:00] <djQuery>                                                  y
[23:20:04] <djQuery> y
[23:20:21] <jrockjiggz> quizme: no
[23:20:24] <systemfault> djQuery: A guess is that he doesn't know about event delegation :P
[23:20:42] <jrockjiggz> no
[23:20:57] <jrockjiggz> i just used live()
[23:21:04] <djQuery> systemfault: gnarf wrote a nifty little snippet that I cant find
[23:21:04] <systemfault> jrockjiggz: Not you, quizme
[23:21:28] <systemfault> jrockjiggz: You obviously understand what is event delegation if you watched that video
[23:21:36] <jrockjiggz> lol im still confused
[23:21:55] <systemfault> jrockjiggz: Do you understand the word "bubbling" in the context of events?
[23:22:16] <systemfault> That's the base of event delegation.
[23:22:25] <__machine> why does $('#myfilefield').attr('value'); return undefined, after i have selected a file?
[23:22:47] <jrockjiggz> __machine: use $('#myfilefield').val()
[23:23:47] <djQuery> __machine: are you leaving out the fact that you field is an input type file?
[23:24:40] <__machine> jrockjiggz: thanks
[23:41:38] <jrockjiggz> ?filter
[23:41:38] <bot-t> .filter(selector): Reduce the set of matched elements to those that match the selector or pass the function's test. http://api.jquery.com/filter/
[23:41:47] <jrockjiggz> ?find
[23:41:47] <bot-t> .find(selector): Get the descendants of each element in the current set of matched elements, filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/find/
[23:42:48] <skylamer`> Ok, now i have a question how can i hide 'something' in selected option when the option is itself selected ?
[23:43:24] <skylamer`> like 'element hide text', but with specific string
[23:43:53] <Sora_> the problem is asign click event in the select
[23:44:14] <Sora_> for show tex
[23:44:17] <Sora_> text
[23:45:24] <skylamer`> mmmm
[23:50:34] <jrockjiggz> ?extend
[23:50:35] <bot-t> jQuery.extend(target, [object1], [objectN]): Merge the contents of two or more objects together into the first object. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.extend/
[23:51:08] <skylamer`> click and in the click change ?
[23:52:17] <jrockjiggz> select doesn't use click, use change() on select
[23:53:03] <djQuery> it uses focus though
[23:53:34] <skylamer`> mmmmm
[23:53:40] <skylamer`> but option ?
[23:53:50] <skylamer`> option:selected click works
[23:53:56] <jrockjiggz> you wouldn't bind option
[23:54:16] <jrockjiggz> if( select.val() == 'option1' ){ //do something }
[23:54:56] <jrockjiggz> $('select').change( function(){ if( $(this).val() == 'option1' ){ //do something }
[23:55:02] <jrockjiggz> $('select').change( function(){ if( $(this).val() == 'option1' ){ //do something });
[23:55:06] <jrockjiggz> $('select').change( function(){ if( $(this).val() == 'option1' ){ //do something } });
[23:55:08] <jrockjiggz> got it!!!!
[23:55:40] <skylamer`> xaxaxa
[23:56:10] <skylamer`> i dont have to check if value equals some thing just to hide specific 'thing' from the string when its selected
