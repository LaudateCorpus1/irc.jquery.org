[01:04:52] <WhirledPress> hey all did they drop .prop as a jquery method in 3.1.1?
[01:05:08] <WhirledPress> wait...nvm
[01:11:31] <WhirledPress> when capturing the click event, I though that $("el").on("click", function (e) { // e.target would be the element clicked
[01:12:17] <WhirledPress> however, I am getting the href property of the clicked anchor element..Any ideas?
[01:25:32] <Uhkis> WhirledPress: this is the clicked element
[01:27:55] <WhirledPress> not if you are handling it on the parent element and want to find the link of it's child
[01:27:59] <WhirledPress> it bubbles up
[01:28:40] <WhirledPress> e.target I thought was the lowest level element clicked. So to find it's anchor element in the anchors parent, you use $(e.target).closes("a");
[01:43:37] <WhirledPress> However, the click handler is fired for both the parent element and the children elements. So the first click event happens on the parent---got it
[01:45:42] <WhirledPress> not quite. drats.
[01:51:14] <WhirledPress> https://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/p3pe23p7/
[01:52:49] <Cork> WhirledPress: e.target IS the element clicked, the element clicked isn't the one with the handler though :)
[01:53:04] <Cork> so if you have more elements inside it it will be the top most element
[01:53:18] <Cork> that is why the "this" variable exists
[01:53:48] <WhirledPress> in my fiddle, $(e.target).prop("id") gives me the id of the child element clicked
[01:53:53] <WhirledPress> which is what I was expecting
[01:54:15] <Cork> ya, it is supposed to
[01:54:18] <WhirledPress> but if it's an anchor element, I was getting it's href attribute, not the anchor itself
[01:54:32] <Cork> uh what?
[01:54:35] <Cork> the attribute?!?
[01:55:16] <Cork> WhirledPress: could you make a jsfiddle?
[01:55:21] <WhirledPress> https://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/7ahvpy3y/20/
[01:56:09] <WhirledPress> I say console.log(e.target+" was clicked)
[01:56:41] <Cork> ah, no
[01:56:54] <Cork> it is just how a.toString() converts uit
[01:56:55] <Cork> *it
[01:57:03] <WhirledPress> i see
[01:57:08] <Cork> https://jsfiddle.net/7ahvpy3y/21/
[01:59:03] <hellyeah> first time i saw that kind of usage $(document).ready(whirled_initFooter);
[02:02:26] <WhirledPress> Yeah I always get the enclosure wrong, so I do it the old way when I have been up for a while and don't want to look it up.
[02:52:31] <WhirledPress> does $.animate always return a promise?
[02:57:39] <Cork> it return a jquery object
[02:57:55] <Cork> and it includes a deferred object
[02:58:06] <Cork> so... no to be strict
[02:58:35] <Cork> if you want a es6 compatible object you can use .promise()
[02:58:54] <Cork> (in later versions of jquery that is)

[05:37:13] <AimlessRaven> how to redirect after scroll
[05:37:14] <AimlessRaven> https://gist.github.com/NikolayPetkov/006d9c54c145aaa00eb075123abb1ed2
[05:37:18] <AimlessRaven> here is my code
[05:53:19] <totoJq> hi
[05:53:39] <totoJq> i want to make ajax request and just it start redirect page
[05:53:59] <totoJq> but when i do this the request is fail
[05:55:51] <hellyeah> what is http status code?
[05:55:56] <hellyeah> can you do small fiddle?
[05:58:18] <totoJq> yes i could
[05:58:20] <totoJq> just wait please
[05:59:27] <jerrycoe> I’m using php and ajax. for some reason the json i’m getting back from php is a string and not a javascript object. in ajax call i’m using dataType: “json”
[06:00:18] <jerrycoe> How can I get it to return a javascript object. I know that I can use parseJSON. but supplying the dataType should already be doing this
[06:02:34] <totoJq> https://jsfiddle.net/dcuq5t8s/2/
[06:03:34] <totoJq> @jerrycoe - make echo json_encode($response); in your server script
[06:03:41] <totoJq> if it's php
[06:06:14] <totoJq> please help^
[06:10:48] <totoJq> @jerrycoe - does it worked ?
[06:12:16] <hellyeah> totoJq:  it seems work here https://jsfiddle.net/dcuq5t8s/3/ what is the exact problem
[06:12:25] <hellyeah> btw you forgot to include jquery lib
[06:14:12] <totoJq> no it's good it works yes, but the thing i want to do is launch an ajax request like this but not wait for response and immediately make a redirect on other page with javascript
[06:14:19] <jerrycoe> I’m just used to getting an object back from my json response
[06:14:55] <jerrycoe> not sure why its not converting it to an object
[06:14:58] <jerrycoe> but whatever
[06:15:05] <jerrycoe> i’ll just use parseJSON
[06:16:08] <hellyeah> totoJq:  well it seems you should use success callback
[06:16:19] <hellyeah> do you have it let me see
[06:16:29] <hellyeah> yea
[06:16:32] <hellyeah> you have it
[06:16:34] <hellyeah> okey
[06:16:41] <hellyeah> just use redirect method
[06:17:12] <hellyeah> totoJq:  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14591428/how-do-i-use-jquery-to-redirect
[06:20:16] <totoJq> yes i did this but the problem is when i used javascript redirection, the ajax request abort and there is an error callback
[06:22:31] <hellyeah> can you update your fiddle?
[06:24:09] <totoJq> yes
[06:25:58] <hellyeah> window.location.href = "https://www.google.com";
[06:26:05] <hellyeah> this is for redirect i guess
[06:29:07] <lenswipee> hellyeah, hell yeah
[06:29:32] <totoJq> yes for sur hellyeah this for redirec
[06:34:36] <totoJq> https://jsfiddle.net/#&togetherjs=hr7aiFGuhB
[06:34:45] <totoJq> i updated
[06:36:12] * hellyeah check
[06:43:24] <hellyeah> totoJq:  you use redirect in wrong place
[06:44:16] <hellyeah> used*
[06:45:53] <totoJq> yes
[06:46:32] <totoJq> i know but how to use after launch the request but without waiting the response ?
[06:47:33] <hellyeah> response is the answer of ajax call
[06:47:47] <hellyeah> if you use redirect in beforesend
[06:48:00] <pippuccio76> hi at all , sorry for english
[06:48:05] <hellyeah> it will redirect you to another page without waiting for ajax to complete
[06:48:33] <totoJq> Ok i understand
[06:48:44] <lenswipee> hellyeah, that depends on the timing of the ajax request on your script.
[06:49:43] <pippuccio76> I want show an upload bar or a modal while i upload a form with file , not upload with ajax but normal post , im tryng to show a modal but the upload dont start
[06:50:10] <totoJq> i found no way to do what i want. Just launch the ajax request (15 seconds script php will turn) and immediately redirect
[06:50:33] <hellyeah> lenswipee probably knows better
[06:51:00] <lenswipee> hellyeah, i know everyting
[06:51:05] <hellyeah> if you use in beforesend it wont wait for ajax to complete
[06:51:06] <totoJq> ahaha
[06:51:14] <totoJq> yes it's normal
[06:51:19] <hellyeah> if you use in success it will wait for ajax to complete
[06:51:28] <hellyeah> lenswipee:  assume you are GOD
[06:51:45] <hellyeah> lenswipee:  let spartacus handle you
[06:52:09] <totoJq> ahah
[06:52:28] <lenswipee> hellyeah, no one can handle me
[06:52:46] <totoJq> there is not event like afterStart() in ajax
[06:52:47] <totoJq> ?
[06:53:06] <hellyeah> whatever you said man :D
[06:53:14] <hellyeah> hmm
[06:54:05] <hellyeah> well i didnt see such event
[06:54:21] <hellyeah> you may want to check github aanxios or github fetch

[08:06:23] <mICON> Hi. I'm adding a dom element via jQuery and I have a click event that triggers on the class of that element. It doesn't work tho since the click handler is added before the element is added to the dom. I remember there being a function .live; Is there a new way to do this?
[08:06:36] <mICON> Apart from adding the handler by hand ofc
[08:10:41] <mICON> I tried .on but it seems to be the same deal
[08:12:09] <hellyeah> can you prepare a fiddle?
[08:12:21] <mICON> me?
[08:12:25] <hellyeah> yes
[08:12:29] <mICON> Uh. Sure.
[08:12:30] <mICON> .fiddle
[08:12:33] <mICON> !fiddle
[08:12:39] <hellyeah> jsfiddle.net
[08:12:51] <hellyeah> if you give some codes here you will get some help for sure
[08:15:09] <shoky_> mICON: you need to use event delegation. read about it in the docs for .on()

[08:17:06] <mICON> https://jsfiddle.net/9p2ppx2d/1/

[09:40:09] <garfy0886> I need help about jquery grid
[09:57:24] <Sal> https://jsbin.com/kivexopuso/edit?html,js,output
[09:57:59] <Sal> is there a way to het the obj.k[1] value without knowing the 's' ?
[09:58:47] <shoky_> Sal:  Object.keys(obj)  gets you an array with all keys of an object
[09:59:14] <BillCriswell> Do you want to loop up the key by its value?
[09:59:19] <BillCriswell> Hi shoky_ !
[09:59:41] <shoky_> heyy there Bill, long time!
[09:59:58] <BillCriswell> Agreed. Too long!
[10:00:15] <shoky_> but you're here to stay this time, yay!
[10:00:18] <Sal> BillCriswell, you mean i have to create a loop and pass all keys?
[10:00:42] <BillCriswell> shoky_: Haha!
[10:00:46] <shoky_> :D
[10:00:48] <Sal> no other way to read an object inside an array?
[10:01:21] <shoky_> Sal: Object.keys(obj.k[1])[0]  will get you the first key in that object..
[10:01:23] <shoky_> i.e.  's'
[10:01:34] <Sal> great! thanks
[10:02:38] <Sal> and for the values?
[10:02:53] <Sal> got it
[10:02:56] <Sal> its just values
[10:02:59] <Sal> thanks again
[10:03:21] <shoky_> Sal: you can get the value by the key.   object[key]  gets you the value
[10:03:52] <Sal> i did Object.values(obj.k[1])[0]
[10:12:59] <Justice> I'm confused atm, i pass an object to func then using elem.find('class').append(object.name) results in nothing.
[10:13:24] <Justice> using append(2 + object.name) gives me 2undefined
[10:13:57] <Justice> if I just above do var lol = object.name and then append using lol variable i get value...
[10:16:00] <BillCriswell> @Justice What is `object.name`, a simple string?
[10:16:16] <Justice> yup
[10:19:27] <litewait> new to jquery.  If I have sourced jquery, and I have a function set up using javascript (not query) 'click' event, can I access $.ajax in it?
[10:22:07] <BillCriswell> Can you replicate it?
[10:22:19] <Justice> BillCriswell: nwm found it, was shadowing the variable with some other object and didnt notice even when staring str8 at it.
[10:22:32] <BillCriswell> @Justice Got ya.
[10:23:00] <Justice> think thats the rule when a beer break is needed.
[10:25:17] <h3ll0> hello, would anyone be willing to look at jquery file ?
[10:30:27] <garfy0886> it' possible click by code a cell in grid?
[10:35:30] <litewait> maybe a better question.  if I have a standard javascript button click function, can I be sure that the function in question has access to $ ?  (meaning document is ready)
[10:58:03] <envision-f> i don't know jquery very well and i'm trying to edit & remove some of the jquery from the file, please msg me if you'd like to help me
[10:59:07] <taplar> your what?
[11:05:19] <MikeD_> envision-f: just don't
[11:08:23] <taplar> envision-f: if you take a look at https://github.com/jquery/jquery it talks about how to build your own version of jquery with the option to exclude things you don't need
[11:23:24] <SaraDR> Hi, if I want my st0ff to be toggled away initially, is there anything I can do in css, or should I just run a on document ready, toggle away over 0 seconds?
[11:23:44] <SaraDR> (coming from having a toggle by changing display, and in that, i'd set the css initially to none)
[11:32:58] <taplar> toggled away initially?  you mean hidden?
[11:35:49] <Christoph> hi guys, anyone here who can help me with my first step into jQuery?
[11:36:10] <taplar> ask away man
[11:36:12] <Christoph> currently having an issue and have no idea how to get arround it
[11:36:25] <Christoph> ^^ thx
[11:37:10] <Christoph> i am creating some HTML in some div ... inside this new HTML i want to select some elements and replace some parts ...
[11:37:40] <Christoph> due to browser not having the DOM redrawn / loaded etc (guessing) ... i cannot manipulate the stuff inside the HTML code
[11:38:08] <taplar> elements don't have to be attached to the dom for you to select on them or manipulate them
[11:38:12] <taplar> for example
[11:38:24] <Christoph> example here: http://everybuddy.bimmermann.net.s3-website.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/
[11:38:42] <Christoph> my loader.js loads two jsons ... first static one is meant to be a template
[11:38:43] <taplar> var $blah = $('<div><p></p></div>'); $blah.find('p').text('hey, put some text in the p!');
[11:39:21] <Christoph> second one will be dynamic at some time and should replace stuff ...
[11:39:36] <Christoph> but when i click the homepage button ... sometimes it only load the outer stuff
[11:39:43] <Christoph> and doesn't manipulate inner ..
[11:39:48] <Christoph> second click helps then ...
[11:39:56] <Christoph> but that"s not my intention ...
[11:40:27] <Christoph> ^^ yeah thats what i tried, a little different but more or less thats a good example of what i believe is the issue ...
[11:41:13] <taplar> we typically ask for an example jsfiddle or something showing the issue that you have, rather than asking us to dig through a webpage.
[11:41:40] <Christoph> yeah ... but it might be timing related as it gets two other json files
[11:42:11] <taplar> it's often the case that in the process of trying to recreate it on a fiddle that you stumble on the issue yourself.
[11:42:16] <Christoph> i can try compressing it into jsfiddle, but will need to call external stuff in my example ... thus not working because of cross origin
[11:43:36] <Christoph> maybe a blink at the loader.js ? http://everybuddy.bimmermann.net.s3-website.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/assets/js/loader.js
[11:44:11] <Christoph> the first function loads call loads some html the second one tries to change some objects in the new load html
[11:44:22] <Christoph> somehow this doesn't want to work
[11:44:41] <taplar> wait
[11:44:52] <taplar> are you expecting the second getJson to fire after the first one finishes?
[11:45:08] <Christoph> yes
[11:45:16] <taplar> that's not how that works man
[11:45:34] <taplar> ajax requests are asynchronous, meaning they do not block code execution that proceeds it
[11:45:37] <Christoph> thats what i realised, but how will it work ;)
[11:45:52] <Christoph> can i some how make it wait?
[11:45:53] <taplar> if you want the second request to happen after the first, it needs to be invoked from within the success of the first one
[11:46:16] <Christoph> okay. that already points me into the right direction :)
[11:47:08] <Christoph> I guess i now know how its gone work :)
[11:47:24] <Christoph> just wasn't aware of the async ... STUPID ...
[11:47:30] <taplar> ;)
[11:47:39] <Christoph> THX a lot ... will try to get it running :)
[11:47:43] <taplar> sure
[11:57:21] <Christoph> perfect it works as expected. just a few minutes of your help saved me a lot of time, appreciate this
[12:03:23] <taplar> np
[13:57:50] <Deusdeorum> yo, how can i reload a jquery script when new data is appended? as it is now the script does not work when dynamically added data appears
[14:01:55] <jquery524> Hi, I wanted to know how to get css properties of a element just before an event was fired
[14:03:04] <taplar> Deusdeorum: typically you would not reload a script.  you would put your logic in a function that could be called repeatedly as needed
[14:03:28] <taplar> jquery524: how are you going to know when 'just before an event is fired' is?
[14:04:41] <Deusdeorum> taplar i have this script that submits closest form in 'boxyboy' https://jsfiddle.net/tw7L6pz9/ but as i dynamically add more 'boxybox'es it wont be fired again
[14:05:30] <jquery524> taplar: I want to make jquery autocomplete dropdown open if new tab is clicked, currently autocomplete hides when I click on new tab
[14:06:01] <MikeD_> is there a jquery way to figure out why an element doesn't get any smaller than about 40px but i can specify a larger width in css?
[14:09:07] <jquery524> Deusdeorum: can you explain your problem again I might have done it before
[14:11:02] <Deusdeorum> jquery524  "yo, how can i reload a jquery script when new data is appended? as it is now the script does not work when dynamically added data appears"
[14:12:16] <jquery524> Deusdeorum: can you explain what you tried to explain using this fiddle https://jsfiddle.net/tw7L6pz9/
[14:12:49] <MikeD_> if "the script" is about events... use delegation to a parent element
[14:12:52] <taplar> Deusdeorum: you are creating new radio buttons after the fact?
[14:12:58] <Deusdeorum> taplar yes
[14:13:08] <taplar> then do what MikeD_ just said.  use delegation instead
[14:13:44] <Deusdeorum> okey, will have to read upon that but you mean this right: https://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/
[14:13:54] <taplar> yes
[14:14:09] <Deusdeorum> thank you
[14:14:19] <taplar> $(selectorForParentOfAllRadios).on('input[type=radio]', 'change', function() { ...
[14:14:26] <taplar> crap
[14:14:36] <taplar> $(selectorForParentOfAllRadios).on('change', 'input[type=radio]', function() { ...
[14:14:39] <taplar> event comes first
[14:15:16] <Deusdeorum> not sure what 'selectorForParentOfAllRadios' means though
[14:15:28] <taplar> heh, exactly what it says
[14:15:29] <Deusdeorum> but as i said, will have to read the docs, did not know where to look
[14:16:13] <taplar> you select a parent that the dynamic elements will belong to.  that is what you delegate bind on
[14:19:08] <jquery524> taplar: What I meant was ONce the event is fired I want to know what were the css properties of an element before the event was fired
[14:19:42] <taplar> i'm not aware of anything from the box that does that
[14:20:10] <taplar> you'd have to build some sort of history thing for that yourself
[14:23:24] <jquery524> taplar: Thanks. :) ok so do you have any idea how to keep autocomplete dropdown open if new tab is was opened
[14:24:41] <taplar> you might can use the search option to make it open http://api.jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#method-search
[14:26:11] <MikeD_> it turns out that some default high-level stylesheet in this environment has an overly aggressive min-width on ".btn"
[14:26:32] <taplar> heh
[14:26:47] <jquery524> taplar: Thanks for help it might work for me.. :D
[14:26:53] <taplar> awesome
[14:37:16] <Deusdeorum> thanks taplar, $('.parent').on('change', 'input[type=radio]', function() { did the trick
[14:47:36] <ekkis> morning everyone.  I'm using query-validate and have 2 fields to validate: fname and lname.  I'm calling a remote service to test for existence so I have something like f.validate({rules: { FullName: { remote: chk } }, groups: {FullName: 'fname lname'}, messages: {FullName: 'xxxx'}, ... }) but the rule is never firing.  am I misunderstanding how it's supposed to work?
[15:04:47] <duch_kazatel> ekkis you're more likely to get help if you make a fiddle fwiw.
[15:05:10] <ekkis> duch_kazatel: ya.  you're right.  thanks
[16:45:09] <checkit> Can someone please help me unf*ck my select2 dropdown in a modal? Please?
[16:45:26] <duch_kazatel> checkit we can try
[16:47:36] <duch_kazatel> ...
[16:47:40] <duch_kazatel> welp
[16:50:17] <checkit> duch_kazatel: Trying to figure out a way to explain this without a paste/jsbin...
[16:50:23] <duch_kazatel> err.
[16:50:32] <duch_kazatel> why not just... make a fiddle?
[16:50:46] <checkit> that's what i meant....
[16:51:02] <duch_kazatel> i mean, why can't you just show the code?
[16:54:33] <checkit> This is the select2 selector. Works fine outside of a modal. Does not work fine in a modal: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/cf050ee4b2eb66f8d021354107a42071
[16:54:45] <duch_kazatel> $(".filter-allergy") you mean?
[16:54:55] <duch_kazatel> and are you trying to select a .filter-allergy inside of a modal?
[16:55:06] <checkit> Yup
[16:55:17] <duch_kazatel> are you selecting after the modal launches?
[16:55:37] <duch_kazatel> some modal libs do some weird stuff with cloning/copying stuff around to launch.
[16:56:09] <checkit> I've tried a couple things. Like binding the plugin to the modal trigger: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/23fb53f985659dcafcfb470e54183387
[16:57:00] <duch_kazatel> try on shown.bs.modal
[16:58:22] <checkit> Whoa... IRC stranger. That's a bit closer.
[16:58:52] <checkit> Looks like the select box has taken on some styles it hadn't previously. Still doesn't actually function though...
[17:00:25] <duch_kazatel> what happens if you move the select2 instance outside of the modal?
[17:00:30] <duch_kazatel> confirmed that works properly?
[17:03:03] <duch_kazatel> if that doesn't work, we'll need a fiddle.
[17:03:50] <checkit> Yeah. Select2 works fine outside of the modal...
[17:04:11] <duch_kazatel> yeah, then we'll need a fiddle to figure it out.
[17:06:58] <duch_kazatel> fwiw making a fiddle for this is trivial.
[17:07:35] <duch_kazatel> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/54j1uL9m/2/
[17:09:31] <duch_kazatel> checkit so.... what doesn't properly work for you?
[17:12:09] <cjohnson> duch are you robert?
[17:12:39] <duch_kazatel> a-hyup
[17:16:54] <taplar> lies
[17:17:33] <duch_kazatel> LIES
[17:26:30] <MassDebates> Of course not.
[17:26:35] <MassDebates> Robert is a german name. Old history.
[17:26:40] <MassDebates> Duch is clearly a Dutch name.
[17:26:45] <MassDebates> I mean, everyone knows that.
[17:26:56] <taplar> i pronouce it duke
[17:27:00] <duch_kazatel> ^
[17:27:04] <duch_kazatel> taplar would be correct.
[17:27:09] <duch_kazatel> because it's not dutch :3
[17:27:23] <MassDebates> Sounds like I'm going to pronounce it duche now xD
[17:27:26] <MassDebates> jk
[17:27:32] <duch_kazatel> oh mans
[17:27:35] <duch_kazatel> so funay
[17:27:37] <MassDebates> Did I break rules sorry
[17:27:42] <duch_kazatel> wat
[17:27:53] <taplar> grammar rulez
[17:27:56] <MassDebates> Something something inappropriate language?
[17:28:14] <duch_kazatel> light ribbing is okay.  being racist/sexist/etc isn't.
[17:28:25] <MassDebates> Got it.
[17:28:43] <MassDebates> I'll cya fellas later!
[17:28:46] <duch_kazatel> 'kay
[17:29:14] <taplar> fellas.  so sexist
[17:29:42] <duch_kazatel> that technically IS a microaggression but i think we can all understand the intent.
[17:29:45] <Duikb00t-home> Robert Maes
[17:29:49] <Duikb00t-home> Trebor Seam !
[17:29:56] <duch_kazatel> wut
[17:30:14] <Duikb00t-home> "Sabrina blijkt na haar kortstondige bezoek aan de sekte van Trebor Seam flink gehersenspoeld. Als zij haar kamer ombouwt tot haar "Tempeltje van de lente" en Marcel en Johnny betrekt bij haar vreemde rituelen, begint de familie zich ongerust te maken en Cois zich boos. Lionel weet de oplossing: Sabrina moet worden geherprogrammeerd."
[17:30:17] <Duikb00t-home> that was it for tonight :D haha
[17:30:44] <Duikb00t-home> When you reverse Robert Maes you get trebor seam which is a group of special peole in a dutch TV show.
[17:30:54] <duch_kazatel> where'd you get "maes" from?
[17:31:05] <Duikb00t-home> I was just thinking about it
[17:31:13] <duch_kazatel> lol 'kay.
[17:31:17] <Duikb00t-home> Now it's time to continue sleep();
[17:31:22] <Duikb00t-home> zzz byeee
[17:32:20] <duch_kazatel> i... don't speak dutch (shrug)
[17:34:36] <duch_kazatel> i am raging at hipchat rn
[17:34:38] <duch_kazatel> ffff
[17:57:41] <taplar> hipchat?
[18:06:35] <nickfday> How do I manipulate elements inside a colorbox/modal/popup using js/jquery?
[18:06:46] <duch_kazatel> select them like you would anything else?
[18:07:15] <nickfday> JS has no effect inside the popup
[18:07:21] <duch_kazatel> wut
[18:07:43] <duch_kazatel> wait are you using bootstrap?
[18:07:48] <nickfday> nope colorbox
[18:08:01] <duch_kazatel> i'd bet the contents don't exist when you run your js.
[18:08:05] <duch_kazatel> got an example?
[18:08:28] <nickfday> sure
[18:11:33] <nickfday> :duch_kazatel OK so it's working fine in a codepen.
[18:11:45] <duch_kazatel> heh.
[18:11:56] <duch_kazatel> is your code in a doc ready or something on your site?
[18:12:17] <nickfday> yep it is
[18:12:32] <duch_kazatel> mind sharing the codepen?
[18:12:32] <nickfday> it must be getting loaded at a different time somehow
[18:12:43] <nickfday> yes I just made a real simple one to demo
[18:15:56] <nickfday> :duch_kazatel http://codepen.io/nickfday/pen/YpJNKx so this is working fine. My actual implementation is within a drupal site. Possibly the colorbox module is behaving different from some reason
[18:16:15] <duch_kazatel> in that case, make sure your code runs after the colorbox stuff.
[18:17:07] <nickfday> yeo must be that. I'm using the cbox_complete
[18:17:07] <nickfday> event hook so it should be in theory
[18:18:19] <nickfday> I think the complication is its loading content from a different page in my implementation
[18:18:39] <duch_kazatel> you mean via ajax?
[18:18:45] <nickfday> yep
[18:18:48] <duch_kazatel> that would do it.
[18:18:59] <duch_kazatel> make sure your stuff is in the .then() for the call.
[18:19:28] <nickfday> ah so I need to return a promise
[18:19:32] <nickfday> sorry my frontend is rusty
[18:22:18] <duch_kazatel> it already returns it for you.
[18:22:19] <duch_kazatel> but yep.
[18:24:37] <nickfday> thanks ok I just need to workout how I am going to pass a variable into from the parent window
[18:24:44] <duch_kazatel> wait what?
[18:25:37] <nickfday> I want to grab an piece of text from the parent page and display it on the child (colorbox)
[18:26:05] <duch_kazatel> so that's in the .then()
[18:26:09] <duch_kazatel> after you append.
[18:26:21] <nickfday> yep
[18:48:47] <sailendra> hi
[18:49:03] <duch_kazatel> good afternoon
[18:49:47] <sailendra> sorry for asking stupid question, i would like to find out which event is fired when button is clicked. i tried using event listeners but cannot figure out from where it is firing.
[18:50:01] <sailendra> any help would be greatly appreciated
[18:50:02] <duch_kazatel> the click event.
[18:50:07] <sailendra> yea
[18:50:09] <duch_kazatel> and could you clarify that second sentence.
[18:50:13] <taplar> heh
[18:50:16] <duch_kazatel> "cannot figure out from where it is firing."
[18:50:39] <taplar> are you trying to figure out where the click handler is being bound?
[18:50:48] <sailendra> taplar: yes correct
[18:52:11] <taplar> so i take it you know where the handler definition is?
[18:53:21] <taplar> afaik there isn't an easy way to do this other than looking for binding that use the method as a handler
[18:53:27] <sailendra> no i dont know where it is defined, it would be no issue if i had found where the handler defination is. it is hard coded on some where
[18:53:33] <duch_kazatel> sooo....
[18:53:37] <duch_kazatel> why do you need this?
[18:54:08] <sailendra> i am working on magento framework where i need to modify cart behaviour using ajax
[18:54:29] <duch_kazatel> so why do you need to know where the handler is bound?
[18:55:21] <sailendra> so that i can rewrite that handler
[18:55:50] <taplar> you understand that if it is an anonymous method there is no way to remove it, other than a blanked unbind, ya?
[18:55:59] <duch_kazatel> ^
[18:56:02] <taplar> blanked/blanket
[18:56:04] <duch_kazatel> something seems funky here.
[18:57:47] <sailendra> yea
[19:17:14] <duch_kazatel> weeeeee
[19:52:08] <nickfday> is there a way to add a callback function to an existing object without redeclaring the object?
[20:17:04] <bjsnider> is it just my computer or is fiddle really slow?
[21:08:29] <bjsnider> oh, nm, found out it was a chrome extension reloading every time the code was run
