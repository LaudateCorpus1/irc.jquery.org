[00:01:33] <juha_> b-ot !== bot-t
[00:02:24] <Cork> Matt_P: no, it returns utf-8
[00:02:39] <Cork> Matt_P: and utf-8 builds from ascii, ex. "ɘ".charCodeAt()
[00:03:13] <Matt_P> then i dont know ;D
[00:03:56] <erdos> so i'm making my first jquery plugin, but i'm a bit confused about how to achieve what i want. i need it to take in an array of data, turn them into $("<div />")'s append them to the dom, but also keep them in an array to modify them later (when the window is resized).. but i don't understand where i store these objects... if the plugin were a class i would store them as class members... but
[00:03:57] <erdos> i know a plugin isn't a class
[00:04:03] <Cork> Matt_P: well he wanted unicode so...
[00:04:17] <Cork> (the answer was correct)
[00:04:37] <Matt_P> excellent
[00:04:38] <Matt_P> lol
[00:05:32] <Cork> erdos: $(this).data
[00:05:53] <Cork> erdos: $(this).data('my-plugin', dom)
[00:06:09] <erdos> Cork: is it ok to store jquery objects in that? i kind of thought it was just like config data
[00:06:24] <Matt_P> erdos,  http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Authoring
[00:06:25] <Cork> its just a fanyc array
[00:06:33] <Cork> fancy even
[00:06:35] <erdos> oh cool!
[00:06:36] <Matt_P> fannyc!
[00:06:42] <FND> is there a simple way to make jQuery UI's autocomplete add an href to the results (without reinventing the wheel)?
[00:06:43] <erdos> thanks matt i just finished reading that
[00:07:05] <Matt_P> Cork gave you the answer, thought the exaple might help :P
[00:07:16] <erdos> :)
[00:08:38] <erdos> so i guess i just store [$("<div />"), $("<div />"), $("<div />")] and iterate through it later
[00:09:30] <erdos> thanks guys :)
[00:09:36] <Cork> uh.. no
[00:09:40] <erdos> oh
[00:09:46] <Cork> thats waistfull like ugg...
[00:10:00] <coldhead> wasteful*
[00:10:06] <erdos> that's what i thought, i think i'm thinking about this the wrong way...
[00:10:09] <coldhead> great work everyone, let's all take five
[00:10:27] <Cork> erdos: $(this).data('plugin', $("<div />").add("<div />").add("<div />"));
[00:10:55] <Cork> no need to store and array of an element in an array of arrays
[00:11:03] <Cork> just store the array :)
[00:11:49] <erdos> ahhhh, got ya
[00:12:20] <erdos> so my first way would have had a lot of duplicated overhead but this way is one $ object with a bunch of $ dom objects in it?
[00:12:23] <Cork> or just do $(this).data('plugin', $("<div /><div /><div />"));
[00:12:34] <Cork> yes
[00:12:49] <erdos> cool gotya, thank you!
[00:12:55] <erdos> Cork++
[00:12:58] <Cork> then you can do $(this).data('plugin').eq(2) to get the third jquery element
[00:14:31] <gnarf> Cork: that add syntax always looked so - meh to me
[00:14:50] <Cork> gnarf: ya, its a bit weird
[00:15:22] <gnarf> also
[00:15:27] <Cork> especially when you do jqvar.add(elm), and then jqvar.css(new-value)
[00:15:34] <gnarf> way safer to use <div></div><div></div><div></div> :)
[00:15:37] <Cork> then then you go why the f*** doesn't it change it :)
[00:15:43] <erdos> hmm, also each div needs to have a bunch of extra data added to it (topPercentage, leftPercentage), which is used to recalculate position on resize, that's why i was going to do the array in the first place, so each element could have it's associated .data("topPercentage")
[00:16:05] <Cork> erdos: i would store that in a separat array
[00:16:06] <erdos> where should i store that extra information?
[00:16:18] <erdos> ah ok, then add some kind of identifier to each <div />
[00:16:33] <Cork> or just do $(this).data('plugin', { obj: $("<div /><div /><div />"), config: [] });
[00:16:55] <Cork> or just do $(this).data('plugin', { obj: $("<div /><div /><div />"), config: [{ leftPercentage: 0.1 }] });
[00:17:21] <erdos> each div has it's own leftPercentage, can i just rely on the order of the array?
[00:17:22] <Cork> then you can match the id your using for jquery with the array in config
[00:17:27] <Cork> yes
[00:17:36] <erdos> sweet!
[00:17:49] <erdos> thank you very much
[00:18:00] <Cork> sorry i meant index not id :)
[00:18:12] <erdos> gotcha
[00:19:09] <pingec> Cork yesterdy you advised me to use lower case ids for elements. Is there any documentation that backs this up? Do you think there is a way to get mixed case ids work properly in every situation :/ ?
[00:19:34] <Cork> pingec: its most legacy rules
[00:19:53] <Cork> and yes theres been quite a lot of info about it, but it was years since i read it
[00:20:11] <Cork> so i don't have a link that actually points to the info :)
[00:20:18] <pingec> aha
[00:20:23] <Cork> (as its closing in to 10 years since i read it)
[00:20:25] <raicho> Hi all, is anyone here experienced with Selectivizr?
[00:20:32] <pingec> My boss won't believe me it doesn't work
[00:20:33] <pingec> lol
[00:20:47] <Cork> "selectivizr"
[00:21:07] <erdos> Cork: last thing, i'll be using .add because i need to iterate through a parameter to add the objects, can i initialize a jquery object with var $dates = $(); then just do $dates.add("<div />"); ?
[00:21:12] <raicho> sorry, lower case 'selectivizr' :)
[00:21:58] <Cork> erdos: $([])
[00:22:09] <erdos> ah ok awesome thank you :)
[00:22:14] <Cork> raicho: i mean't that word doesn't say me anything
[00:22:45] <Cork> erdos: just give him a short testcase
[00:22:55] <erdos> ?
[00:22:57] <Cork> erdos: yes its a bug in sizzle, but its a fact
[00:23:01] <Cork> opps wrong nick
[00:23:05] <Cork> pingec: ^
[00:23:08] <erdos> ah hehe
[00:23:33] <raicho> Oh I see, selectivizr is a tool that emulates css3 in ie8<, it ties in with jquery amongst other things
[00:23:42] <Matt_P> O_o
[00:23:54] <Cork> pingec: and actually looking at the old specs upper case is valid, so its just experiences of "its risky"
[00:24:12] <Cork> pingec: and by fact it breaks jquery
[00:24:39] <pingec> hmm ok
[00:25:09] <Cork> raicho: that sounds like a new clone of IE7.js and IE8.js (but for ie9)
[00:25:29] <Cork> raicho: and from experience back when they came, yes they work, but they'r really slow
[00:25:34] <raicho> Cork: never heard of either of those, so I will check those out
[00:25:43] <Cork> not worth it
[00:26:03] <Cork> https://code.google.com/p/ie7-js/
[00:26:16] <raicho> Cork: I simply need something that can interpret nth-child(odd/even), even when I code it in jquery it doesn't seem to work out
[00:27:41] <MagePsycho> hi guys
[00:28:01] <MagePsycho> any good autocompleter suggester where we can pass extra input field as params
[00:28:52] <mansoor-s> MagePsycho, wut?
[00:29:09] <MagePsycho> jquery plugin for autosuggest
[00:29:21] <mansoor-s> there are many
[00:30:59] <MagePsycho> the one where i can pass other field as params
[00:31:50] <mansoor-s> MagePsycho, just read the fields and set it as a possible option
[00:33:23] <MagePsycho> nope . most of the autosuggest are called on onload
[00:33:32] <MagePsycho> so at the runtime .. it's not getting other field values
[00:35:11] <raicho> I've tried to use nth-child(odd/even) on the following page: www.ppitracker.com/test/7yunnan/menu.php, but to no success, in IE8 it refuses to do so
[00:35:24] <raicho> is anyone able to take a peak and tell me where I'm going wrong...?
[00:36:23] <tw2113> i'd wager IE8 has no support for it raicho
[00:36:25] <Cork> raicho: ie8 doesn't support nth-child, so you might have to use a fallback class name
[00:36:45] <raicho> hmmm, does jquery not implement nth-child by itself?
[00:36:55] <tw2113> or selectivizr
[00:37:01] <Cork> raicho: but the lib might convert the css for you
[00:37:13] <Cork> raicho: no it doesn't
[00:37:24] <raicho> that'
[00:37:29] <Cork> jquery only supports the css selectors the browser supports
[00:37:30] <raicho> that's frustrating! *
[00:37:35] <tw2113> http://selectivizr.com/
[00:37:49] <raicho> tw2113: I was talking about selectivizr earlier
[00:37:57] <Cork> yup :)
[00:38:03] <raicho> but when I implement it, it refuses to work
[00:38:10] <tw2113> i wasn't paying attention
[00:39:00] <raicho> tw2113: are you familiar with selectivizr?  I've just uploaded my selectivizr version to the same link
[00:39:21] <raicho> tw2113: as far as I'm aware, everything should work, but it's not, can you shed any light on it?
[00:39:37] <tw2113> have you properly linked it?
[00:39:46] <raicho> I believe so
[00:40:08] <tw2113> looks like it
[00:40:15] <raicho> I just ripped the link code straight off the website and adjusted the source url
[00:40:20] <tw2113> i am not too familiar exactly how it works, but i know it exists
[00:40:51] <raicho> I know I could just use a class like Cork mentioned, but I'm being stubborn
[00:41:05] <raicho> I don't want to go through every page and put it in
[00:41:15] <tw2113> i think selectivizr grabs your css
[00:41:17] <tw2113> and helps
[00:41:30] <tw2113> so if you're still trying to use jquery to do the nth-child, it may not be picking up
[00:41:46] <raicho> I've removed my jquery code and stuck with selectivizr
[00:42:00] <tw2113> selectivizr relies on jquery
[00:42:13] <tw2113> link jquery
[00:42:15] <raicho> sorry I meant kept the jquery lib
[00:42:22] <tw2113> then link selectivizr
[00:42:29] <raicho> but removed my hardcoded jquery code to implement nth-child
[00:42:37] <tw2113> then do <style> div:nth-child { something } </style>
[00:42:50] <tw2113> add a red border or something noticeable
[00:43:00] <tw2113> and do your selector right
[00:43:04] <tw2113> instead of my quick typing
[00:43:17] <raicho> yeah I think I got all that....
[00:43:25] <raicho> but I'll go over it again
[00:51:06] <caddoo> I'm using a plugin which adds keyboard navigation to table rows. Its used like this $(el).npNav();
[00:51:22] <caddoo> what would be the best way of removing this plugin from the element
[00:51:29] <caddoo> so i can reinitiate it
[00:51:42] <Cork> $(el).npNav('destroy');
[00:52:14] <Cork> and have a section in the plugin that cleans up after it selfs and restores everything to how it was before it was added
[00:52:32] <Cork> or reverts all the changes it did rather
[00:57:17] <caddoo> ok Cork so it's up to the plugin dev
[00:57:40] <Cork> caddoo: it should
[00:57:58] <Cork> caddoo: but it can be done outside it, but then you have to know what the plugin did
[00:58:00] <Cork> to revert it
[00:58:08] <caddoo> ok ill just add to the plugin
[00:58:16] <caddoo> it's simple anyway won't need to upgrade it
[01:01:13] <caddoo> how do i remove jquery keyup events then
[01:01:25] <caddoo> it seems to be all it does
[01:01:40] <Cork> caddoo: add a namespece when you bind it
[01:02:12] <Cork> caddoo: 'keyup.my-plugin', 'keydown.my-plugin' .off/.unbind ('.my-plugin);
[01:02:27] <Cork> caddoo: *'keyup.my-plugin', 'keydown.my-plugin' .off/.unbind ('.my-plugin');
[01:02:58] <caddoo> don't follow that at all, ill have to look into namespaces then
[01:03:27] <Cork> caddoo: jquery keeps things in scope based on whats after the dot
[01:03:37] <Cork> then you can remove all events thats bound with that namespace
[01:04:15] <Cork> so .bind('keydown.scope') .bind('keyup.scope') and then you can remove both with .unbind('.scope')
[01:04:23] <caddoo> i see
[01:04:25] <caddoo> makes sense
[01:04:58] <erdos> hey Cork: with this: http://pastebin.com/LCyY3DrW , it's broken because reshuffle() is invoked from some context (window maybe?) when the resize event causes the function to run... is it ok to do $(window).bind("plugin", {}); ?
[01:06:12] <Cork> erdos: first its rarly window but document you bind to
[01:06:23] <Cork> as the highest top
[01:06:33] <erdos> ah ok
[01:06:48] <Cork> secondly i'm not really sure what you mean
[01:07:05] <Cork> you want the plugin to be notified when the window resizes?
[01:07:11] <erdos> that's right
[01:07:32] <Cork> lol. should prob have read your question a bit more careful before answering :)
[01:07:37] <erdos> it's running the function but i don't understand how to access the .data i bound to $(this) previously
[01:07:41] <Cork> then yes you have to bind on window
[01:07:46] <erdos> ahh
[01:07:55] <Cork> thats the only element that gets the resize event
[01:08:18] <erdos> ahhhh ok cool thank you again :)
[01:08:21] <erdos> Cork++
[01:08:23] <erdos> Cork+++++++++++++++++++
[01:08:45] <Cork> though i often like doing $(window).resize(function(event) { $.event.trigger('resize', event); });
[01:08:52] <Cork> well not often :)
[01:09:04] <Cork> opps missed a part
[01:09:14] <Cork> though i often like doing $(window).resize(function(event) { $.event.trigger('window-resize', event); });
[01:09:43] <erdos> does that go everywhere?
[01:09:58] <Cork> no it triggers all bound listners for window-resize
[01:10:10] <erdos> that would probably be better i think
[01:10:14] <Cork> thats the beauty of it, it doesn't bubble
[01:10:29] <Cork> it just triggers jquerys list of "window-resize" listeners
[01:10:42] <erdos> i think this is what i want
[01:11:23] <Cork> erdos: that line is just thrown together from memory so it might be a bit wrong though
[01:11:42] <erdos> i'm reading the .trigger page now :)
[01:11:52] <erdos> wait
[01:11:52] <Cork> its not part of the trigger page :)
[01:11:57] <erdos> wrong page
[01:12:07] <erdos> .event
[01:12:10] <erdos> err
[01:12:16] <erdos> i'm going to have to read a few of these
[01:12:18] <Cork> .event isn't listed either
[01:13:08] <Cork> this is pieced together from reading the jquery source
[01:13:13] <erdos> yikes
[01:13:19] <erdos> y no docs for .event?
[01:13:20] <Cork> i needed it to implement a websocked notification system
[01:13:33] <erdos> lol
[01:13:52] <Cork> "$.event.trigger('se:' + listner, [events]);"
[01:14:02] <Cork> so i remembered correctly :)
[01:14:16] <Tram> Good morning all. I have a question. I want to use jquery to put a div arround a select. Anyone knows if thats possible? : http://jsfiddle.net/aqjkc/
[01:14:41] <Cork> erdos: the second variable needs to be an array though
[01:14:44] <Koopz> my datepicker is broken... everytime i open it and select something, it dissapears, reappears and disables the text input
[01:14:58] <Cork> erdos: its used as callback.apply(this, arr)
[01:15:18] <Cork> erdos: so the first value in the array will be the first argument to the event callback
[01:15:36] <erdos> oh man this is hectic, maybe i should just bind to window then go get a jquery book on the weekend :P
[01:16:00] <Cork> erdos: i doubt you will find any book that will talk about that
[01:17:48] <erdos> hmmmmmm
[01:17:53] * erdos thinks
[01:18:22] <Cork> the best source for how apps/frameworks is well - the source :)
[01:18:35] <Cork> *work is well - *
[01:19:10] <erdos> hehe yeah, i'm only just getting my head around javascripts oo/prototype model
[01:19:16] <erdos> still lots of study to do
[01:19:38] <pingec> $('#RequestForm input') -> $('*[id="RequestForm"] input') seems to work as a workaround
[01:20:05] <Cork> pingec: you have just quadrupeled the seek time for that selector
[01:20:21] <xecycle> Hello, I tried to use slideshow in drupal, using the views slideshow module.  In Chrome my styles for the images won't work, but works fine after I clicked any link and back to the page.  What may be wrong here?
[01:20:27] <Cork> pingec: try something like $('#Requestform').find('input'), that MIGHT work
[01:20:41] <Cork> and won't have horrible performance
[01:21:15] <Cork> pingec: but really, the cleanest solution is to just not use uppercase
[01:23:17] <erdos> Cork you are awesome and thank you very much for your help, but i've decided i'm just going to bind to window for this project, and start thoroughly reading the jquery docs this weekend
[01:23:58] <pingec> I see, but having to convert case would really hurt us
[01:24:50] <Cork> pingec: search replace should solve that in a few minutes
[01:25:07] <Cork> like 5
[01:27:13] <pingec> Im porting a winforms app to the browser. There forms have ids and case is very important when we do some processing. Losing case would trigger a lot of workarounds on the server side which I have no control of
[01:28:01] <Cork> ah, i "love" when they split the dev team between server and web...
[01:28:18] <Cork> that always results in fun "no control"
[01:29:41] <juha_> Cork: indeed..
[01:32:05] <pingec> :/
[01:35:33] <dan> guys  i have following string "\u0D85" - how do i use this to print it's relativeu unicode character ?
[01:38:18] <Cork> dan: String.fromCharCode(0x0D85)
[01:38:36] <dan> Cork thanks
[01:39:08] <subdesign> hi, using scrollTo for page navigation, my first page is always blinks for a moment. how to disable this?
[01:39:44] <Cork> subdesign: run the scrollTo in ready instead for load
[01:40:22] <subdesign> i use this now: $(document).stop().scrollTo('#start', 1000, { easing: 'easeOutCubic' });
[01:40:36] <subdesign> clicking on a menu item
[01:45:39] <Koopz> my datepicker keeps reappearing after selecting a date
[01:49:39] <Tram> Good morning all. I have a question. I want to use jquery to put a div arround a select. Anyone knows if thats possible? : http://jsfiddle.net/aqjkc/
[01:50:12] <politron_> well I'm trying to cache a div that I already render using localStorage
[01:50:20] <politron_> but the second time that I extract the value of the div is not a [div#ajaxContainer.linear_v] is a [Object object] what I supposut to do?
[01:50:30] <politron_> I have to serialize and deserialize with JSON or something similar
[01:50:34] <erdos> Tram: $("selector").wrap("<div />"); i think should work
[01:50:37] <erdos> something like that
[01:50:42] <erdos> check the docs on wrap
[01:50:44] <politron_> The first time that I render if localStorage.getItem("test") == null
[01:51:06] <politron_>  value = $('#ajaxContainer').load(url + ' #ajaxContainer > *'
[01:51:28] <Cork> politron_: you can't serialize a dom tree
[01:51:38] <politron_> then I save in localstorage localStorage.setIttem("test", value)
[01:51:41] <Cork> you need to convert it to html and store that
[01:51:57] <politron_> but next time that I read that variable like I said is Object object
[01:52:10] <Cork> ya, cause your storing the dom object
[01:52:21] <Cork> and you can't store dom objects in string format
[01:52:24] <politron_> ok how can I convert into html?
[01:52:28] <Cork> .html()
[01:52:40] <politron_> let me try
[01:53:31] <politron_> so just this ?localStorage.setItem("test", value.html());
[01:53:36] <politron_> before storage?
[01:54:00] <Cork> yes
[01:55:23] <politron_> when I get the value is return as string
[01:55:40] <politron_> and I need to use it to load the page again
[01:55:54] <politron_>         var value = localStorage.getItem("test");
[01:55:54] <politron_>         if (value != null) {
[01:55:54] <politron_>             $('#ajaxContainer').load(value);
[01:56:17] <Cork> load uses an url
[01:56:19] <Cork> not content
[01:56:30] <Cork> you can't get the url from the dom
[01:56:57] <Cork> so when it comes from locaStorage you need to use .html(html)
[01:57:02] <Cork> or value as your calling it
[01:57:16] <Tram> @ erdos thanks!!
[01:57:19] <politron_> ok so in this case then how do you inject into this div container
[01:57:44] <Cork> me points at the line he wrote last
[01:57:53] <politron_> cast as (html)??
[01:58:00] <Cork> so when it comes from locaStorage you need to use .html(html) <--
[01:58:02] <politron_> var value = (html) localStorage.getItem("test");
[01:58:06] <Cork> so when it comes from locaStorage you need to use .html(html) <--
[01:58:14] <Cork> you don't cast in javascript
[01:58:19] <Cork> thats for typed languages
[01:58:41] <politron_> ok, sorry I'm pretty new in Javascript
[01:59:01] <Cork> so just replace load with html and your done
[01:59:29] <Cork> make sure you don't expect any javascript on that though
[01:59:34] <Cork> cause that will be gone
[02:00:41] <politron_> mmm let me see if there's something else because just doing this ($('#ajaxContainer').html(value);)  is not working
[02:00:56] <Cork> politron_: you should get the page content
[02:01:01] <Cork> but its just the html
[02:04:56] <grifx> can I show you my code
[02:05:13] <grifx> And can you tell me if it's the best way to do that ?
[02:05:50] <grifx> http://jsfiddle.net/jnKwA/
[02:07:52] <politron_> Cork, well I will continue investigating, thanks for the help
[02:08:07] <computer2000> how can i find out what index the element has, which ive clicked onto? i mean, did i click on the first or second .elem ?
[02:08:31] <Cork> computer2000: .index() ?
[02:09:05] <computer2000> Cork: thx got it
[02:10:38] <ag4ve> computer2000: $(#el).bind( this.val // iirc ) -- google
[02:10:40] <erdos> Tram: np
[02:10:59] <Cork> ag4ve: wtf
[02:12:54] <ag4ve> oh, he wanted the index.... still google :)
[02:13:13] <Cork> ag4ve: your code doesn't make sense at all
[02:14:24] <grifx> I've got a problem
[02:14:29] <grifx> My json is like: [],["10 "," 200"],["1 "," 6"],["350 "," 850"],"2","2","2","2"]
[02:14:40] <grifx> But how can I put a key ?
[02:14:45] <Cork> is there an array around that?
[02:15:05] <Cork> grifx: you can't put a key in an array
[02:15:11] <grifx> http://jsfiddle.net/jnKwA/
[02:15:14] <Cork> it needs to be an object if you do
[02:15:32] <grifx> ugh, Can you show me an example
[02:15:38] <Cork> [[],["10 "," 200"],["1 "," 6"],["350 "," 850"],"2","2","2","2"]]
[02:15:48] <Cork> [[],["10 "," 200"],["1 "," 6"],["350 "," 850"],"2","2","2","2"], { "key":"val"}]
[02:15:58] <grifx> no you don't understand
[02:16:09] <grifx> my json is generated from variables and arrays
[02:16:37] <grifx> i want that the name of the variable to be write in the json
[02:16:57] <erdos> if that's all you've got in your json those names are lost
[02:17:08] <erdos> you'd need to do that on the other side
[02:17:33] <Cork> grifx: so var obj= {}; for(var i=0;i<arr1.length;i++) { obj[arr1[i]] = arr2[i]; }
[02:18:09] <Cork> where arr1 is the key array, and arr2 has the values
[02:18:36] <grifx> I just have to declare values as {}
[02:18:38] <grifx> http://jsfiddle.net/jnKwA/
[02:19:02] <grifx> and put a key and not push arrays
[02:19:09] <Cork> yes
[02:19:24] <Cork> {} is the declaration form of new Object();
[02:19:34] <Cork> just like [] is the declaration form of new Array();
[02:19:52] <grifx> Hmmm
[02:20:00] <grifx> So  coool, you're awesome thanks Cork
[02:20:10] <grifx> That's working
[02:20:17] <Cork> not sure where this is awesome
[02:20:24] <Cork> its just js basics
[02:45:03] <sumon> Hi! Question: If I define $(".element").click() (or .on("click") etc, can I catch which subelement was clicked? (f.ex. I want to do something special if (".element > a") was clicked)
[02:46:53] <aga> is there a way to check if query is loaded before I run any query related things?
[02:47:24] <aga> simon inside the function $(this) relates to the clicked object
[02:47:32] <aga> sumon ^
[02:48:05] <xec> sumon: you can check e.target
[02:48:20] <sumon> Actually, $(this) will refer to the element ".element" if I define it like that, it won't refer to ".element a"
[02:48:25] <greek> To check if a table row contains a <td> with a specific id?
[02:48:50] <xec> ?contains
[02:49:00] <greek> Or if it contains a <td> whose "xyz" attribute is set to "1"
[02:49:20] <greek> Does the ? call up a bot?
[02:49:27] <xec> yeah except the bot is offline
[02:49:41] <xec> greek: i think you can use :has() for that
[02:49:44] <greek> I've googled contains() thanks xec
[02:49:45] <Cork> and that happens a lot
[02:50:17] <xec> greek: $('tr:has([xyz="1"])') or something like that
[02:50:17] <Cork> you should never try to look for what an element contains
[02:50:26] <Cork> by design thats slow
[02:51:56] <greek> Cork, what would you recommend? Basically I'm pushing item onto a queue, but if they're already in the queue, I'd like to pop them from wherever they may be before pushing them again onto the front
[02:52:20] <greek> So my logic was "check if it has <td> whose attribute "part_id" is "x" and if it does, remove it, and then add it again on the front"
[02:52:29] <Cork> so you don't want to select the parent that has it, you want to find the element?
[02:52:34] <mansoor-s> Hello internet people
[02:52:40] <Cork> thats a different matter
[02:52:59] <Cork> greek: if your queue is a table
[02:53:06] <greek> a <tr>
[02:53:08] <Cork> the tr should have an identification for that row
[02:53:21] <Cork> and you should find the tr based on that  identification (a class or id)
[02:53:31] <greek> there's only one <tr>. I should have used a <ul>
[02:53:37] <greek> but that's irrelevant no?
[02:53:40] <Cork> you should ya
[02:53:59] <greek> the table cells are the queue items
[02:54:03] <Cork> well it just moves down one step
[02:54:08] <greek> ok
[02:54:17] <Cork> you should put the identity on the td
[02:54:23] <Cork> not look for elements inside the td
[02:54:41] <Cork> identify the element you want not a child to it
[02:55:04] <Cork> finding a child from a parent is fairly fast
[02:55:41] <greek> yeah I've got the IDs on the <td>
[02:55:47] <greek> sorry if I miscommunicated that
[02:55:56] <Cork> so you want to know if the id exists?
[02:56:05] <greek> so basically now I'm trying to say if(row has td with ID x)
[02:56:19] <Cork> if($('#id').length) {}
[02:56:22] <Cork> thats all you need
[02:56:26] <greek> genius
[02:56:49] <greek> oh wait it's a custom attribute called part_id (as opposed to the "id" attribute)
[02:56:51] <Cork> well should be a bit more explicit if($('#id').length > 0) {}
[02:56:59] <Cork> ah
[02:57:09] <Cork> side note you should call it data-part_id
[02:57:17] <greek> Cork noted, thanks
[02:57:23] <Cork> data- namespace is reserved for custom attributes
[02:57:34] <greek> yup I forgot about that, thanks for reminder
[02:57:45] <Cork> ok, that makes your original question much more understandable :)
[02:58:11] <Cork> $(tr).find('[part_id="id"]').length > 0
[02:58:28] <greek> This seems to work if($("tr#recent_parts_row td[part_id=" + part_id + "]").length > 0)
[02:58:57] <Cork> remove the first td
[02:59:00] <Cork> sorry tr
[02:59:07] <Cork> the rest is good
[02:59:11] <greek> Sweet
[02:59:15] <greek> Does removing the tr speed it up?
[02:59:18] <Cork> yes
[02:59:20] <greek> I just left it in there for my own readability
[02:59:34] <Cork> what you did finds all tr's then looks for the one with the id
[02:59:40] <Cork> while the other looks for the id
[02:59:48] <greek> eek
[02:59:51] <Cork> and as the id is uniq, no need to look for the tr
[03:00:02] <greek> Yeah that makes perfect sense. Ok thanks again for the awesome insight.
[03:02:53] <greek> Ok next question, I am successfully finding the part (say it's in position 5), which I'd now like to move to the front (instead of removing it and prepending it from scratch). Is that possible? To just move it?
[03:03:25] <greek> .position().first()
[03:11:43] <fALSO> Hi there!!!
[03:12:03] <fALSO> I have a "difficult" question
[03:12:20] <fALSO> if i want to do this:  a = $('#blah').autocomplete(options);
[03:12:30] <fALSO> but blah is added to the page via AJAX
[03:12:44] <xarxer> fALSO: live()
[03:12:50] <fALSO> how can i make that "be ran" when that is added to the page
[03:13:06] <fALSO> ok, let me look into it :)
[03:16:07] <Cork> fALSO: you would have to use a function that you run when the element is added
[03:16:36] <Cork> fALSO: you can't bind a jquery function to run in the future
[03:16:49] <fALSO> that live() wont work ?
[03:16:52] <Cork> no
[03:16:54] <fALSO> Description: Attach an event handler for all elements which match the current selector, now and in the future.
[03:17:00] <Cork> and on top of that live is depricated
[03:18:14] <Cork> live has been replaced by delegated event listeners
[03:18:19] <Cork> but thats for events
[03:18:28] <Cork> you want to run a command on it
[03:19:22] <fALSO> hum :(
[03:19:29] <fALSO> this wont be easy
[03:25:35] <NodeX> fALSO : if you want somehting to happen when an element is added look at livequery a plugin that deals with that sort of thing
[03:25:40] <fALSO> i found a way
[03:25:55] <fALSO> i just need to figure out how to "check" if a element exists
[03:26:14] <NodeX> $("selector").size();
[03:30:17] <juha_> size() is slow, use $("selector").length
[03:36:59] <jalexandru> hi, I'm making an ajax call to a php function that builds the options of a select element; in javascript I go with " document.getElementById("cp_city").innerHTML=xmlhttp.responseText;" to write the response how should I write it with jquery? thanks
[03:37:42] <HughAJWood> Using jquery for the ajax to?
[03:37:51] <jalexandru> yes
[03:38:43] <jalexandru> HughAJWood: is a pastebin with the jquery needed?
[03:40:02] <HughAJWood> Easiest would be to give you a good link with an example, the most complicated part is the response text from the php, is it json encoded? or just plain text?
[03:40:26] <jalexandru> plain text
[03:41:16] <pharotek> anyone here using linux? it's just taken me 3 hours to work out why the .addClass was malfunctioning. In a completely unrelated .js file there was a }) missing.
[03:41:36] <pharotek> I could use a new tool for writing in which could identify that for me
[03:41:49] <pharotek> my current editor seems underpowered in that respect
[03:43:25] <juha_> jalexandru: you could do this: $("#cp_city").load("your/url.php");
[03:44:04] <jalexandru> juha_: and that would output what the php file would echo? basically that's what I need ... ?
[03:44:18] <xarxer> pharotek: What IDE are you using?
[03:44:25] <HughAJWood> jalexandru: are there any parameters for your page?
[03:44:33] <jalexandru> yes I send 2 parameters
[03:44:39] <pharotek> xarxer, please expand IDE?
[03:44:55] <xarxer> pharotek: What's the app you're writing in called?
[03:45:10] <pharotek> Geany
[03:45:50] <xarxer> pharotek: Perhaps Aptana Studio could identify such things, but when you've deployed your project/files, you should be able to use Google Chrome's inspector to identify such problems...
[03:46:00] <HughAJWood> then load wont be good enough, you need to use jquery.ajax() and then set the text of the target element, or the html if you are using html in your return
[03:46:19] <HughAJWood> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[03:46:44] <HughAJWood> Load just loads text straight from the target page, you can hack it a little but its not nice to read if you do that
[03:46:46] <pharotek> xarxer, would this website need to be published on the internet to use the chrome service?
[03:46:55] <xarxer> pharotek: No
[03:47:02] <xarxer> pharotek: You can do it locally
[03:48:29] <jalexandru> thanks for the link HughAJWood, that's on my background .... I send the 2 variables, I don't know how to give the html element to a tag inner html... that's where I'm stuck; $("#log").html( msg ); will this write the html respons as inner html for the #log element?
[03:49:47] <HughAJWood> basically .html() uses innerhtml that fallsback on dom manipulation if innerhtml isn't suitable
[03:50:45] <HughAJWood> being plain text and no html surrounding it, you are maybe best with .text()
[03:52:14] <pharotek> xarxer, thanks, i'll look into it. I don't see why chrome wouldn't work on my laptop. It is archaic. Hopefully I'll make neough from this website to upgrade (IBM Thinkpad T40 lol)
[03:52:55] <jalexandru> HughAJWood: I have html tags also the thing is that (msg) is not the output of the php file; msg is the confirmation message and not the info send by "xmlhttp.responseText" how do I get the xmlhttp.responseText (or html because I have html tags) from the ajax call?
[03:53:58] <HughAJWood> the ajax call will be plain text, if it has html then use .html() and it will do the right thing for you, however if you need to add it to the end of something you may want to use .append()
[03:55:54] <jalexandru> HughAJWood: hmmmm from the info I've reached now ... I'm guessing that success: function(data) {  $('.result').html(data);} would help me; will try and let you know if this is it... thanks for your patience
[04:03:11] <pingec> How do I "empty" the .load() event handler?
[04:03:31] <pingec> Like I want to remove it
[04:05:05] <pingec> .unbind('load') ?
[04:05:40] <HughAJWood> if you mean remove the binding yes, you might need to use prop though for ie
[04:06:53] <pingec> prop ?
[04:08:20] <HughAJWood> .prop("load", null) but only if it doesnt work in ie8 < but I'm not sure off the top of my head if thats the case with with load
[04:08:21] <danheberden> .on( 'load', fn ); .off( 'load' )
[04:08:28] <danheberden> it's _that_ easy
[04:08:39] <danheberden> you can specify the function if you want to unbind a specific handler
[04:08:48] <danheberden> otherwise, .off( 'load' ) will unbind all load events
[04:09:30] <3JTAAAJ10> hey any idea about jquery slides shows datetime values, which will exclude weekends?
[04:09:45] <danheberden> pharotek: you asked in jquery-dev, which isn't the right place, but it sounds like you need to lint your code
[04:10:03] <danheberden> pharotek: check out grunt: http://weblog.bocoup.com/introducing-grunt/
[04:10:14] <danheberden> it has linting and minification built in
[04:10:32] <danheberden> 3JTAAAJ10: that question doesn't *quite* make sense
[04:10:42] <pingec> thanks for the explanations
[04:10:48] <pharotek> danheberden, thank you very much for the advice!
[04:23:14] <aga> mansoor-s: you make it sound like we are hidden behind six feet of cold cold ground :D
[04:33:14] <MasterX1> Greetings everyone .
[04:38:22] <MasterX1> Can anybody point me to a relevant article on how to avoid spaghetti code ? I've recently build a website that displays large quantities of text in the same DIV in multiple languages . The result was a 93KB file that includes a monster switch statement with over 50 cases and 3 variables .
[04:38:22] <MasterX1> I'm thinking that right path would have been if I placed the text in a text file and than load it up via  AJAX ,  but then I would have had to search trough the file for the correct paragraph . It would have also taken some extra time to call the text from the server and that's something I would like to avoid .
[04:38:22] <MasterX1> Any opinions ?
[04:42:43] <Cork> MasterX1: alternatively is split the files up into languages and save each language in its own file
[04:43:09] <Cork> and then concut it into the page server or client side based on the language used
[04:44:00] <Cork> another point is to split the switch feature up, and use functions instead
[04:51:56] <MasterX1> The Switch is the backbone of the script . What I'd like to do is minimize the gargantuan text in each Switch case . I'm thinking to use your idea and chop it out of the main file and then import the code from that file . This way I don't have to scroll for ages to reach the relevant code .
[04:51:56] <MasterX1>  I believe the  .getScript might be of some use or I could append the text script to the Head element .
[04:51:56] <MasterX1> What do you think ?
[04:53:27] <Cork> MasterX1: you can go to the point where you ex. have a folder for each language and pick file by putting the name in the path
[04:53:35] <Cork> then you don't need a switch for it at all
[04:54:05] <Cork> MasterX1: getScript is to load javascript files, and is prob not what you want
[04:54:16] <Cork> what your looking for is prob getJSON
[04:56:15] <MasterX1> What I'm thinking is something like : swtich
[04:56:24] <MasterX1> Fat finger
[04:59:40] <MasterX1> The first file contains : //switch(foo1 + " " + foo2 + " " +foo3) { case "1 2 3":function foo1foo2foo3 } ;   Then the second file contains the function which targets the Node , inserts the text and styles it . That's why I though of .getScript .
[05:00:18] <MasterX1> Without the "function" word in the case.
[05:00:30] <MasterX1> The function declaration would be in the second file .
[05:05:03] <MasterX1> Does that sound plausible ?
[05:05:32] <Cork> not really
[05:05:50] <Cork> you can't really load parts of the file like that
[05:06:03] <Cork> or rather you can't fall functions based on what you loaded
[05:06:09] <Cork> fall==call
[05:06:34] <Cork> well you can, but it makes it pointless
[05:06:48] <Cork> if you want to load it as functions you can just send them when the page loads
[05:07:00] <Cork> no point in putting it into ajax calls
[05:08:54] <computer2000> is there an equivalent to .hasClass for IDs?
[05:09:16] <Cork> .has
[05:09:17] <computer2000> like .hasId('myID') ..
[05:09:21] <Cork> no sorry its is
[05:09:27] <Cork> is('#id')
[05:09:34] <computer2000> Cork: ok thx
[05:10:27] <MasterX1> Well what I'd like to do is have only one file included HTML call besides jQuery .
[05:10:46] <MasterX1> *in the  HTML call
[05:10:49] <ProblemEmitter> hello
[05:10:57] <ProblemEmitter> i have a slight problem thats getting urgent
[05:11:17] <Cork> MasterX1: my point is you if the text is static, it should be included when you load the page
[05:11:30] <Cork> MasterX1: ajax only slows it down if the text is static
[05:11:39] <ProblemEmitter> doMove = function() { $('#container').animate({'top' : '+=40'}, 500, doMove); } doMove();
[05:11:56] <ProblemEmitter> this code animates a element but there is a bad delay between animations
[05:12:16] <ProblemEmitter> it is not constant as intended (machine is fast)
[05:12:35] <ProblemEmitter> its like the callback gets called 50ms later or something
[05:12:43] <ProblemEmitter> or there is some easing involved?
[05:12:44] <Cork> ProblemEmitter: it would be nice if you could write up a testcase for what your trying to do
[05:12:54] <Cork> jsfiddle.net is a good place to do so
[05:13:05] <ProblemEmitter> that single line is the testcase
[05:13:27] <Cork> no thats a code line
[05:13:36] <Cork> a testcase is a working html+css+js combo
[05:14:04] <ProblemEmitter> on it
[05:14:11] <ProblemEmitter> wait a sec ill do it right now
[05:14:16] <Cork> its a lot simpler to answer these kind of questions if you can see the effect
[05:16:47] <MasterX1> The text is dynamic as per my definition . I mean it's the same container that gets emptied and then filled up with different content .
[05:16:48] <MasterX1>  Sometimes I might even create and delete HTML elements then style them and add event triggers to them . So it quickly goes from simple to over 1000 lines of code . Much of that code only inserts and styles content .
[05:16:49] <MasterX1> Scanning 1000s of lines to find what you want to modify is something akin to coding hell no matter the IDE
[05:17:42] <MasterX1> That's why i'm trying to work out how to separate the advanced code from the code monkey code .
[05:18:16] <Cork> MasterX1: sounds like the base of the problems comes from you putting things in js that should be in html
[05:18:36] <ProblemEmitter> Cork: there you go: http://jsfiddle.net/8Qekj/
[05:18:39] <Cork> text and markup should be in html, and js should just show/hide the sections
[05:18:42] <ProblemEmitter> do you see a delay between the animations?
[05:19:21] <Cork> ya
[05:19:28] <Cork> not sure you can do much about it though
[05:19:38] <ProblemEmitter> why not?
[05:19:57] <Cork> cause i suspect that its caused by the animation queue
[05:20:19] <Cork> when the animation ends the callbacks fire and you queue a new animation for the next pass
[05:20:20] <ProblemEmitter> its seems to be a rather large issue
[05:20:29] <Cork> that might mean you miss the next animation queue
[05:20:38] <Cork> and that would result in ca a 10ms delay
[05:20:44] <Cork> and that would be enough to give that effect
[05:21:16] <ProblemEmitter> so, im working on a node.js + websocket + jquery realtime game and i cannot have a constant animation if i need to?
[05:21:35] <ProblemEmitter> ill probably write my own animation function, then
[05:22:20] <Cork> ProblemEmitter: the thing is you want to add things to the queue before the old one ends
[05:22:21] <ProblemEmitter> or can i strip out some of jQuerys internal code to speed things up?
[05:22:25] <Cork> thats where you get the problem
[05:22:43] <Cork> hmm, that might actually work
[05:22:50] <Cork> you get a step callback from animate
[05:23:04] <Cork> you could prob use that to fire the next animation queue a bit earlier
[05:23:53] <Cork> http://api.jquery.com/animate/
[05:27:24] <MasterX1> True , I'm violating code separation in some measure . It's is however refreshing not to have a trainload of invisible content in the HTML file . It's also the case of dynamic style and dynamic placement . It's easier to insert a container Node at a location , then to create the same container in multiple locations and hide it .
[05:27:25] <MasterX1> It also helps me not go insane by memorizing 1001 classes and IDs . The 3 variables make the function name sound something like a breadcrumb . Something like Continent > Country > City . Eventually on gargantuan projects I might use multiple files and even send the simple files to other devs . So that's why I'm looking for a solution that keeps the HTML and CSS short and sweet .
[05:30:53] <dogmatic69> Hi all, I am getting this error on a site "Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'defaultView' of undefined"
[05:31:17] <dogmatic69> somewhere in jquery, but on my local version it does not happen
[05:31:28] <dogmatic69> any ideas what that could be?
[05:31:45] <Cork> you have something that trys to access defaultView
[05:31:53] <Cork> on a null variable
[05:32:25] <dogmatic69> Cork: how can that work locally but not remote?
[05:32:44] <Cork> best is to run the not minimized version of jquery
[05:32:55] <dogmatic69> Cork: it is
[05:33:13] <Cork> then check the error console for the line number
[05:33:23] <dogmatic69> 6727
[05:33:33] <dogmatic69> if ( (defaultView = elem.ownerDocument.defaultView) && (computedStyle = defaultView.getComputedStyle( elem, null )) ) {
[05:33:33] <Cork> go there put a breakpoint and backtrack it to where the null variable comes from
[05:34:02] <dogmatic69> back trace http://bin.cakephp.org/view/859152718
[05:35:05] <Cork> the stacktrace won't help me
[05:35:25] <Cork> you need to check where the undefined variable comes from
[05:41:44] <Melsom> http://jsfiddle.net/fMhWK/ - Could anyone help me out with this code? I want the "gridItem" to show viewInfo and load the ID. If you click the same gridItem again, it should close. But it seems like you can't go back to a gridItem you've previously chosen. My guess is that it remembers and saves the toggle state. Any clue as to how I can resolve this?
[05:42:11] <Melsom> err http://jsfiddle.net/fMhWK/2/
[05:48:27] <e-dard> Not sure if I need to use JQuery or not but… I want the browser to download a CSV version of the page in my web-app when the accept header of their request has "application/csv" or something similar
[05:48:39] <e-dard> Do I have to use JQuery to achieve this?
[05:49:14] <e-dard> Because obviously the accept header will need to change and I don't think browsers can do that right?
[05:49:24] <Cork> you can't start a download from js
[05:49:35] <e-dard> Bugger
[05:49:42] <Melsom> PHP perhaps?
[05:49:44] <Cork> well you can but it demands you simulating a link click
[05:50:01] <shoky> invisible iframe works too no?
[05:50:08] <Melsom> If you need to modify headers i believe PHP would be the best thing to use.
[05:50:08] <e-dard> Wait, Cork can you explain what you mean exactly regarding the js/download thing?
[05:50:17] <shoky> well or just redirecting to a download link
[05:50:38] <Cork> e-dard: if you ex. fetch a csv file through ajax, it won't be offered as a download to the user
[05:51:09] <Cork> e-dard: if you want the user to be able to get a download option, you need to trigger a full page load
[05:51:26] <Cork> and if a full page load you can't modify the accepts header
[05:51:58] <Cork> e-dard: best option is to have either the original server or a proxy look for the url ending
[05:52:05] <Cork> .csv and go from there
[05:52:05] <b-ot> Cork, 1 object in it (only a f.e.), and i want to do y if there are serveral objects in it
[05:52:17] <er_dos> hey there
[05:52:24] <Cork> b-ot: hush it!
[05:52:46] <e-dard> Cork: OK, understood. I'm really reluctant to do the whole .encoding thing. It doesn't seem right to me at all
[05:53:12] <Cork> e-dard: well you'r basing it on the accept header, and thats not what its for
[05:53:22] <Cork> thats to tell the server what the client can handle
[05:53:22] <e-dard> Well, not that it's wrong, just that I think it's nicer to have the same location for one resource, and simply ask for it to be represented in different ways.
[05:53:27] <Cork> not to pick what to send
[05:53:36] <e-dard> Cork: true :-)
[05:53:50] <Cork> so its correct to a point, but its also wrong
[05:53:58] <e-dard> Everything is wrong!
[05:54:27] <Cork> the ending is cause thats a common way to difference the urls
[05:54:36] <Cork> but you can have a folder url difference or a params
[05:54:39] <e-dard> It sounds like the Ralils extension approach is the most pragmatic then.
[05:54:52] <Cork> but thats how it need to differentiate
[05:55:24] <Cork> e-dard: there is a reason why they do it that way :)
[05:55:59] <e-dard> I think for an API I would still do accept header as it's probably simpler for a client to set that header than potentially build URLs based on what they want in terms of representation
[05:56:13] <Cork> e-dard: i would go with both
[05:56:40] <Cork> let the header limitate, and the extension pick
[05:56:49] <Cork> cause the extension can only ever be one type
[05:57:08] <Cork> the accept header can (and often are) multiple
[05:58:19] <Cork> for example this is what browsers normally send as accept neader=> text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8
[05:58:32] <Cork> */* isn't exactly limiting :)
[05:58:59] <e-dard> Very true
[05:59:55] <e-dard> Interesting stuff, Cork  :-)
[06:07:42] <kalleth> heya, bit of a weird one involving draggable and css rotations -- http://jsfiddle.net/sCguA/14/ shows the problem -- when unrotated, the image can be dragged (via its container proxying through margins to the bg - fiddl emakes this clearer) fine, no problem, but after the image has been rotated (click the link) it 'jumps' whenever you click on it. Anyone got a sec to look at this?

[06:12:51] <ProblemEmitter> my epic custom animation function -- anything to optimize?
[06:14:11] <granden> Is it possible to remove all <hr> from a div using jquery?
[06:14:53] <shoky> granden: what do you think
[06:14:56] <callumacrae> $(div).find('hr').remove()
[06:16:08] <granden> ah I have to find it first?
[06:16:19] <granden> I tried $(this).remove('hr);
[06:16:22] <granden> with no success
[06:16:45] <rmurphey> granden: .remove() is a method you call on what you want to remove
[06:17:06] <rmurphey> you were trying to pass it what you wanted to remove as an argument
[06:17:16] <ProblemEmitter> $('select your div here').find('hr').remove()
[06:17:56] <granden> rmurphey: Ok, I see. thanks!
[06:18:01] <granden> ProblemEmitter: Thanks. :)
[06:19:34] <HughAJWood> kalleth: the ui position is the unrotated position
[06:20:10] <kalleth> HughAJWood: I get that, but i'm not sure how to solve it
[06:20:16] <kalleth> just created an SO question here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12513520/jquery-draggable-with-rotation-jerking-when-dragging-when-rotated if you want points :)
[06:20:20] <kalleth> i have to go
[06:20:26] <kalleth> (other stuff to dothis afternoon :()
[06:20:49] <kalleth> i've previously tried setting the overlay container width/height to height/width of the image once rotated, but that seems to do weirdness too

[06:21:33] <shoky> ;p
[06:21:36] <kalleth> fuck mac
[06:22:15] <kalleth> naff, shoky, that seems to be it
[06:22:21] <kalleth> i'll have to look at that later
[06:24:34] <kalleth> thanks very much for the find
[06:24:37] <sandbags> anyone using jqPlot know if it's possible to get rotate the Y axis label so that it's rendered vertically rather than horizontally?
[06:25:08] <granden> a find, can it search in the deep as well?
[06:25:41] <granden> like $(#div).find(hr) where <div id="div"><div></div><div><hr></div></div>
[06:25:42] <granden> ?
[06:25:59] <sandbags> ah, i see it is... just need to figure out how
[06:26:38] <shoky> Melsom: your fiddle works as you described..
[06:26:44] <shoky> Melsom: i mean, correctly
[06:27:10] <Melsom> shoky: if you click the first div, the second div, and back to the first, it closes instead of keeping viewInfo open.
[06:27:17] <shoky> ah
[06:27:27] <Melsom> I'd like to keep it open unless you click the same twice.
[06:27:29] <rmurphey> granden: try it and see?
[06:27:33] <Melsom> Is that possible?
[06:29:06] <HughAJWood> Melsom: you want it to close the viewInfo on a double click?
[06:29:58] <Melsom> HughAJWood: Unless you click the same div twice in a row, like a toggle, it should keep it open and load data-id (to be replaced with load from external script).
[06:30:16] <shoky> Melsom here's one way http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/fMhWK/4/
[06:30:55] <shoky> well i could've just used .text() instead of .data
[06:31:11] <shoky> but this way it'll work if you wanna show something else besides the id
[06:31:14] <Melsom> shoky: look at that :) but if you click the same div twice, you can't open it again it seems?
[06:31:26] <shoky> oh ya
[06:31:54] <ddssc_> ssss
[06:31:55] <diegoviola> hi
[06:31:58] <shoky> Melsom: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/fMhWK/5/
[06:32:26] <Melsom> shoky: thank you so much :)
[06:32:34] <shoky> yw
[06:36:58] <diegoviola> i'm trying to have an ajax observer that will ask a database if a change has been made in a specific part of the database, and then have a popup to notify the user, any ideas where should i look at?
[06:38:40] <shoky> diegoviola: ask a more specific question.. which part is troubling you now? what've you tried?
[06:39:51] <diegoviola> shoky: i haven't tried anything yet, i'm just curious if $.ajax() would work for this?
[06:39:56] <shoky> sure
[06:40:02] <diegoviola> ok ty
[06:40:52] <Gho5t> obviously it can't call the db directly
[06:41:04] <Gho5t> you just make a service method that it can call as a middle-man
[06:41:50] <diegoviola> right
[06:41:51] <diegoviola> thanks
[06:43:50] <stewbydoo> anybody home?
[06:44:50] <stewbydoo> anybody here a pro with jquery UI dialog?
[06:45:05] <shoky> ?ask @ stewbydoo
[06:45:05] <Gho5t> just ask the question
[06:45:06] <bot-t> stewbydoo, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[06:45:13] <termite> nope
[06:45:19] <stewbydoo> wow okay
[06:45:57] <stewbydoo> Instead of the jquery UI buttons just being text can I insert images there?
[06:46:51] <stewbydoo> for the dialog buttons that is
[06:48:06] <Melsom> any way to make show('slow') slide down from the top?
[06:48:06] <pom> I'm trying to use .add to add jquery object to collection, but I seem to have an empty element afterwards. http://pastie.org/4760166
[06:48:20] <ScottG> So I thought you aren't suppose to use for..in loops without checking for hasOwnProperty?
[06:48:29] <ScottG> Because it looks like jQuery does it everywhere...
[06:49:08] <rmurphey> pom: why not just say btns = d
[06:49:19] <Gho5t> stewbydoo: iirc your choices are to use css to make that happen e.g. set a background image and text-indent: -1000px or some shit. or don't add the buttons in the first place by setting the buttons array option to an empty array, and then just add them yourself and manually set their click handlers

[06:53:31] <mesuutt> hi, I wrote a ie kicker plugin(https://github.com/mesuutt/kickie.js). I want to show warning box the center of screen. I am getting outer hegiht of the box  42 when loading plugin, after load I am getting 247. What cause this problem and how can I solve this?
[06:56:14] <rmurphey> pom: http://jsfiddle.net/rmurphey/CtqpL/
[06:56:24] <rmurphey> this is working for me ...
[06:57:16] <rmurphey> pom: can you make a jsfiddle that shows the full use case? i.e. the form etc
[06:58:26] <adz_> Hi. Say I have a really big object: vote_cookie[GRADER.current_debate].questions[GRADER.current_question][candidate + '_candidate'] I am not sure whether GRADER.current_debate or questions or GRADER.current_question or [candidate + '_candidate'] are present on the object. How do I check recursively if the expression is defined without throwing a cannot read error
[06:58:34] <pom> rmurphey: You pretty mutch got the jist of it right there.
[06:58:43] <rmurphey> pom: yes, but mine works :)
[06:59:13] <adz_> for simplicity let's say it's cookie[0].questions[0]['candidate_left']
[06:59:22] <pom> rmurphey: How do I run this fiddle?
[06:59:28] <pom> Oh, I press run.
[06:59:29] <rmurphey> click the run button at the top
[06:59:30] <pom> :S
[06:59:31] <rmurphey> and open your console
[06:59:34] <adz_> and I want to do if(!cookie[0].questions[0]['candidate_left') { .... }
[06:59:55] <adz_> missing a ] there but you get the point
[07:00:21] <pom> I get this in the console "[ ]", an empty array.
[07:00:38] <pom> Or empty jquery object I guess.
[07:00:56] <pom> Anyway, I solved it by doing btns = btns.add()
[07:01:03] <rmurphey> ohhhh
[07:01:04] <rmurphey> yes
[07:01:12] <rmurphey> that is what your problem was :) add creates a new object
[07:01:16] <ravenzz> mh
[07:01:17] <rmurphey> sorry, duh
[07:01:42] <pom> The doc doesn't read like that is the intended behavior, or I can't read.
[07:01:43] <pom> :)
[07:01:46] <pom> Thanks a bunch though.
[07:01:53] <rmurphey> pom: Given a jQuery object that represents a set of DOM elements, the .add() method constructs a new jQuery object ...
[07:01:55] <ravenzz> any good idea on how this code could be refactored in order to avoid the refresh method? http://jsfiddle.net/jUzKP/
[07:02:00] <rmurphey> http://api.jquery.com/add/
[07:02:04] <docmur_> Okay so I was here yesterday with the same bug and I have no completely eleminated PHP, so there must be something wrong with how I'm calling the PHP file, Because I can enter it but can't recieve anything back,  this is the code: http://jsfiddle.net/ejGrp/   O
[07:02:13] <er_dos> hey in my plugin i need to have some things happen on resize, but when the resize function is called "this" is referring to the window object, is there any way i can get the object that the the plugin was called on, inside that method
[07:02:27] <docmur_> I know it's not the PHP because I can edit the header information directly and 403 redirect myself inside of it
[07:03:43] <ScottG> So I thought you aren't suppose to use for..in loops without checking for hasOwnProperty? Because it looks like jQuery does it everywhere...
[07:04:36] <termite> ScottG depends on what you are using it for.  If the object inherits then you should use it
[07:05:33] <ravenzz> ScottG it does
[07:05:44] <ravenzz> length = obj.length, isObj = length === undefined || jQuery.isFunction( obj );
[07:06:02] <ravenzz> oh sorry I misread your
[07:06:04] <ravenzz> question
[07:06:53] <djsounds02> http://cl.ly/image/1W3B1I0K0m3U  How would I implement something like this into a slideshow obviously to move through the slides?
[07:07:56] <er_dos> hmmmm this has me baffled
[07:09:32] <ScottG> termite: I think the point of doing that is that you don't know if it inherits so you should always use it.
[07:10:41] <termite> ScottG: true, but if you get a JSON object from an ajax call is it going to inherit?
[07:11:15] <ScottG> termite: It is if I modified Object :/
[07:12:06] <ScottG> termite: I've been told that it's just safest to use $.each to loop.
[07:15:35] <djsounds02> Anybody know how to control a slideshow with a range slider?
[07:16:23] <termite> docmur_: typo if( otuput )
[07:20:10] <greek> Hey fellas. I have jquery ui tabs inside of a container div whose ID is "tabs", and I'd like to do a .each() so that I can go through each of the tabs. But I'm not sure how to strucure my selector to select each of the tab's divs / panels
[07:20:34] <greek> $("#tabs .class-of-tab").each(...) would be ideal except my tabs don't have a class
[07:20:40] <greek> Not that I know of anyway
[07:21:41] <greek> .ui-tabs-panel?
[07:22:19] <hariom> I want to use .on() but the selector is getting its id value dynamically. So I have defined it as: $("body").on("click", "#save_" + id, function(e) { ... }); But it doesn't seem to work
[07:22:31] <hariom> any problem in this syntax?
[07:24:29] <er_dos>  hariom: can you make all the elements have a specific class?
[07:25:41] <ProblemEmitter> hariom: its flawed
[07:25:51] <NoiseEee> hariom: if you're really using it like that, just put the listener on the element, not <body>
[07:26:59] <hariom> ProblemEmitter, NoiseEee, er_dos: Using a fixed class work as suggested by er_dos. Though dynamic id doesn't seem to work. <body> or any other parent element doesn't matter I think
[07:27:26] <NoiseEee> hariom: well why use an ID if the class method works?
[07:27:28] <hariom> in fact, it should work with $(document).on as well. I know close is better but what if body is the closest?
[07:28:02] <hariom> NoiseEee: Why eat burger if you can fill stomach with fruits?
[07:28:19] <NoiseEee> hariom: and since a document can only have unique IDs, if you *really* want to observe the actual element, observe it and not body.on
[07:28:54] <hariom> NoiseEee: How to observe a dynamic element which has 'id' but not 'class'.
[07:29:13] <Palanivel> hey ......i have one small doubt....i dont know it's possible or not......how to know in b/w  length of two button.....consider 1 from left side and 1 from right side
[07:29:26] <NoiseEee> hariom: $('#'+idName).on('click',function(ev) { //whatever })
[07:29:28] <Palanivel> is there is any option to find the gap
[07:30:18] <hariom> NoiseEee: Let me try that also
[07:30:42] <Palanivel> if have any idea please lets share else tell the suggestion it's possible or not
[07:31:03] <danshtr> Hi All. Why var $d = $("<div>"); returns two objects?
[07:31:12] <hariom> NoiseEee:  $('#'+idName).on('click',function(ev)    Doesn't see to work
[07:31:53] <hariom> This is working $("body").on("click", ".save", function(e) { ... });
[07:32:11] * AdamPDotty counts brackets
[07:32:33] <hariom> NoiseEee: I guess dynamic selector's doesn't work with .on() ? Not sure. but practically I am feeling this
[07:32:42] <NoiseEee> hariom: show me it not working on jsfiddle.
[07:33:19] <AdamPDotty> idName should be set when you "reach" that line
[07:34:07] <danshtr> Is  var $d = $("<div>") a selector, or is it object creator?
[07:34:20] <AdamPDotty> neither
[07:34:56] <AzizLight> Hi everybody
[07:35:06] <peterschmidler> Why dos this not work? $('.title p, .title a').css('text-shadow',  '0 1px 0' + 'red');
[07:35:20] <NoiseEee> danshtr: console.log($('<div>'));
[07:35:31] <peterschmidler> Aah missing space. Thanks!
[07:35:44] <AdamPDotty> yep
[07:35:46] <AdamPDotty> hehe
[07:36:28] <danshtr> NoiseEee: looks like a new object. isn't it?
[07:36:44] <faraway> danshtr: it creates a dom node that is not attached to the dom
[07:36:45] <AdamPDotty> danshtr: its s set, ok a jQuery object
[07:36:55] <AdamPDotty> ähhm nm
[07:37:13] <AzizLight> I have this code: http://pastie.org/4760555 for ajax pagination, but the ajax pagination only works once. If I replace on() by live() it works as expected...I though live() was deprecated in favor of on(), but it doesn't seem to replicate the functionality of live()...
[07:37:18] <er_dos> can anyone tell how i can pass the current context through to the method that responds to the $(window) resize, I've tried: var theContext = $(this);   $(window).bind("resize.calendar", methods.reshuffle, theContext);
[07:38:26] <faraway> AzizLight: $("#stream .pagination").on("click","a", .... )
[07:39:51] <AzizLight> faraway: that doesn't fix the problem... on still works only once
[07:40:56] <danshtr> faraway: AdamPDotty thanks
[07:41:07] <faraway> AzizLight: ah sorry my fault  $("#stream").on("click",".pagination a", .... )
[07:41:38] <faraway> AzizLight: didn't realize that you replace the whole content of #stream
[07:42:08] <fALSO> can anyone reccommend a good autocomplete/combobox
[07:42:22] <AzizLight> faraway: awesome it works now, thanks a lot!
[07:51:28] <jammsen> can i animate display none?
[07:51:36] <jammsen> and display block as well?
[07:51:49] <Gho5t> how bout opacity dawg
[07:52:24] <jammsen> i wanna minimize my object, not just hide, the height of the container should be go down as well
[07:52:30] <jammsen> you understand?
[07:52:59] <theallan2> $(...).animate( { height:0, opacity:0 } );   ?
[07:53:02] <Gho5t> duh
[07:53:09] <Gho5t> combine the css properties
[07:53:13] <Gho5t> ^^
[07:53:50] <xec> jammsen: for the easy way you can use .slideUp() and .slideDown()
[07:54:06] <theallan2> Hi folks - think I might have an IE8 issue here, and just thought I'd double check before opening a bug: http://jsfiddle.net/xhMuy/1/
[07:54:22] <Gho5t> theallan2: let's just assume yes
[07:54:38] <theallan2> heh - fair enough
[07:55:01] <jammsen> xec: how can i combine slide and animate?
[07:56:07] <theallan2> er slide does its own animate
[07:56:07] <jammsen> xec: sorry, i got it, i have to use slow instead of 0 ;)
[07:56:18] <jammsen> yeah newbie mistake my bad ^^
[07:56:23] <faraway> theallan2: none or selfclosing spans are bugs in IE thats right, they also bad if you just place them that way in the html code without javascript
[07:56:58] <xec> Gho5t: "let's just assume yes" <-- what does that mean?
[07:57:07] <Gho5t> it was a joke...
[07:57:13] <xec> oh
[07:57:13] <Gho5t> implying that IE sucks
[07:57:58] <theallan2> @faraway The odd part about it is that it works when passed into append(), but not from the main selector.
[07:58:15] <theallan2> Does it not use the same fragement creation method?
[07:58:41] <hariom> How to disable all other links & button on a page if a particular button is visible?
[07:58:44] <xec> theallan2: it is a known IE bug i believe, hold on
[07:59:00] <hariom> Have a common class and disable on it?
[07:59:52] <termite> theallan2: I can confirm that I get the same issue in ie*
[07:59:59] <termite> ie8
[08:00:18] <theallan2> hariom: if ( $('button.mybutton:visible').length ===  ) {... }
[08:00:39] <theallan2> termite: Yes I should have said that, IE8. Works as expected in IE9
[08:01:00] <theallan2> hariom: if ( === 1 ) :-)
[08:01:32] <hariom> theallan2: Didn't get what would it do? and what is the logic behind it
[08:02:04] <xec> theallan2: looks like it's the first line that bugs in IE -- http://jsfiddle.net/xhMuy/3/
[08:02:51] <theallan2> oops! yes
[08:02:56] <termite> theallan2: odd I changed it to '<span></span>' and it's still doesn't work
[08:03:40] <theallan2> @hariom - it gets the element if its visible (see the :visible selector docs). Then you know ifits visible or not and you can take some action on the rest of hte page
[08:03:56] <xec> theallan2: anyway, it's only "Tags that cannot contain elements may be quick-closed or not" according to the docs http://api.jquery.com/jQuery
[08:04:10] <hariom> ok
[08:06:00] <theallan2> @xec: fair enough, but it seems inconsistent atm
[08:06:23] <xckpd7> question: so I'm breaking into object oriented javascript, and could use a little help. I'm struggling with the usage of this throughout my program
[08:06:35] <xec> but as long as it is a single element i would expect .append() to behave the same as jQuery() - i.e. use createElement instead of innerHTML which is most likely what's causing this
[08:06:51] <xckpd7> of what I know, there are 2 ways to deal with that... use apply/call, or before you have something that changes the value of this, set this to a variable right outside of it, and then use that
[08:06:58] <xckpd7> but that seems pretty messy to me...
[08:07:09] <xec> theallan2: i thought there was some clear instructions on this but can't find it at the moment
[08:08:16] <theallan2> xce: I've opened bug http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/12581
[08:09:03] <xec> theallan2: in any case, as long as the html is valid (spans need to be closed but inputs don't etc) it seems to always work http://jsfiddle.net/xhMuy/6/
[08:09:25] <theallan2> xec: yup - valid input is the way forward :-)
[08:10:00] <Alex_______> hi. what is wrong with this code? thanks for help! http://jsfiddle.net/Wks7g/
[08:10:10] <peterschmidler> What's the smartest way of moving the container left and right? Not sure yet about the UI. Maybe drag? And it would be nice to work on touch dip lays, too... http://codepen.io/peterschmidler/pen/BaGjm
[08:11:27] <xec> Alex_______: to start with, there is no #arrangements or h2 (so your selector is pretty much botched)
[08:11:59] <xec> Alex_______: and addClass() is not defined (as a stand alone function)
[08:12:12] <xec> Alex_______: what exactly are you trying to do
[08:16:40] <Alex_______> xec: that was just a mistake at fiddle. tried it with alert(hash); also. I have to add a class to an element. the hash can be found as class in the h2 element. seems, that the "hasClass(hash)" doesn't work.
[08:17:42] <xec> Alex_______: okay well first of all, explain what you're doing. what is this code supposed to do
[08:18:50] <Alex_______> xec: hmmm. tried it once more. now it works. i'm sorry.
[08:18:51] <diverdude> The scrollbar is not scrolling all the way down because the height of the ul is set to be only 150px in the css. It is set to 150px because the height of the box needs to be just that. Is there any way i can fix the height of the box as done while being able to scroll to the bottom programitically? (http://jsfiddle.net/eNfM4/29/)
[08:28:30] <shoky> diverdude: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/eNfM4/31/
[08:29:24] <diverdude> shoky: oh nice what did you do?
[08:30:44] <shoky> diverdude: added a div with the fixed height and overflow:auto, which wrap just the <ul>. changed the <ul> to default overflow, and scrolled the div using the ul's height
[08:32:09] <shoky> it actually scrolls "too much" like that. this is more exact: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/eNfM4/32/
[08:32:18] <shadyKhan> i have an element that is fixed. How can i stop making it follow at a certian point?
[08:32:24] <shoky> er actually thats not enough now
[08:33:25] <diverdude> shoky: is it ok now?
[08:33:51] <shoky> diverdude: if all you wanna do is scroll to the bottom you can use the first one
[08:34:09] <diverdude> shoky: ah ok....and the second one?
[08:34:28] <hariom> How to disable link or button click if any one button is active? I know how to detect if that button is active but how to disable all other? I have a common class in all these elements (class = "freeze_elements")
[08:35:58] <[fields]> hariom:  $('.freeze_elements').prop('disabled', true);
[08:36:19] <diverdude> shoky: thank you very much
[08:36:24] <hariom> [fields]: trying it out
[08:36:53] <shadyKhan> How can i Stop fixed position scrolling at a certain point?
[08:36:55] <shoky> diverdude  if you need more control this is more in line with what you gotta do- http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/eNfM4/33/
[08:37:13] <shoky> now it scrolls exactly to the bottom
[08:38:16] <hariom> [field]: doesn't seem to work. Other links and buttons are still active
[08:39:10] <[fields]> hariom:  that is how you disable links or submit/buttons identified by a class.
[08:39:59] <[fields]> hariom:  if you need to disable more buttons, then copy that line and modify to suit your needs.
[08:40:27] <shoky> shadyKhan: you can use plugins like waypoints , or you an do it yourself, handling scroll events and changing position from fixed
[08:47:39] <dogarrhea2> so i need to detect a popup window.
[08:47:45] <dogarrhea2> is this do-able in q unit?
[08:56:03] <dogarrhea2> is capturing a popup even in the scope of a unit test?
[08:56:59] <johnkpaul> dogarrhea2: "capturing"?
[08:57:24] <dogarrhea2> my code creates a popup.  i need to see if it's created
[08:58:02] <dogarrhea2> just create a selenium test? i think this is beyond the capabilities of qunit
[08:58:18] <dogarrhea2> maybe even beyond selenium. as windows getting popped up involve os
[08:59:56] <johnkpaul> dogarrhea2: you need to see if it is "created"
[09:00:06] <johnkpaul> that creation can be an event fired somewhere
[09:00:09] <johnkpaul> or a function being called
[09:00:11] <termite> dogarrhea2: what are you trying to do in selenium?
[09:00:12] <johnkpaul> whatever it is, you should mock
[09:00:26] <johnkpaul> dogarrhea2: have you looked into sinonjs's mocking framework?
[09:00:32] <dogarrhea2> see if a popup is present with a specific title/elements etc.
[09:00:48] <johnkpaul> ideally, you'd write a unit test for whatever unit is responsibile for triggering the popup
[09:00:52] <dogarrhea2> no. i have not. i wonder what this mocking is
[09:00:55] <termite> dogarrhea2: yes you can do it in web driver 2
[09:00:55] <johnkpaul> and in that unit test, you'd just make sure that the trigering happens
[09:01:11] <johnkpaul> and in an end to end/selenium test, you'd test the integration
[09:01:29] <dogarrhea2> hrm i'd rather just see if its there. i'll just do the selenium test
[09:01:39] <dogarrhea2> the mock is just extra piping to me for now
[09:01:45] <johnkpaul> imho, selenium tests are very slow and annoying en masse
[09:01:47] <johnkpaul> piping?
[09:02:30] <termite> johnkpaul: web driver is fast with the headless driver
[09:02:39] <johnkpaul> dogarrhea2: if you're more interested in this, this might be helpful http://addyosmani.com/blog/unit-testing-backbone-js-apps-with-qunit-and-sinonjs/ as well as confreaks.com/videos/1007-jqcon2012-plugin-unit-testing-get-around-the-event-loop
[09:02:49] <johnkpaul> termite: not as fast a thousand unit tests
[09:03:07] <johnkpaul> even with the headless drivers, it's still painfully slow IMHO
[09:04:56] <termite> johnkpaul: depends on what you do with it. I can run hundreds of them in just a few minutes
[09:05:19] <johnkpaul> sure, depends on the size of the code base, and how it's setup, definitely
[09:05:23] <ag4ve> sorta ot, but anywhere i can find free icon images?
[09:05:30] <johnkpaul> but I can run hundreds of unit tests in hundreds of milliseconds
[09:05:36] <johnkpaul> or less
[09:05:37] <termite> and that is on 15 different browsers
[09:05:46] <johnkpaul> termite: selenium grid or sausce labs?
[09:05:49] <ag4ve> i just need some sort of an edit thing
[09:05:53] <johnkpaul> termite: you must have a lot of resources in terms of $
[09:05:55] <johnkpaul> to set that up
[09:06:16] <termite> we run both
[09:06:30] <termite> sauce labs is just to confirm results
[09:08:06] <termite> but yeah I prefer using unit tests and jellyfish
[09:12:01] <johnkpaul> ah that's cool termite
[09:12:04] <johnkpaul> I've never used jellyfish
[09:12:30] <Sicp> I place the jquery file (as downloaded from jquery.com) inside my Eclipse Javascript project and I get an error inside the file, well tons of errors..
[09:12:35] <Sicp> I tried to do Clean too, nothing
[09:12:48] <Sicp> this has never happened to me before
[09:12:50] <johnkpaul> Sicp: minified version?
[09:12:54] <Sicp> I always just...use jQuery
[09:12:58] <Sicp> yea johnkpaul
[09:13:05] <johnkpaul> eclipse validation is choking
[09:13:07] <johnkpaul> use the dev version
[09:13:11] <Sicp> ok
[09:13:14] <Sicp> lint issue you mean?
[09:13:19] <Sicp> cause I can disable mint validation
[09:13:30] <johnkpaul> probably not just lint
[09:13:33] <termite> yeah lint goes nuts on jquery
[09:13:34] <johnkpaul> there are multiple validations that run
[09:13:43] <johnkpaul> I dont' remember the options in eclipse, havent' used it in a while
[09:13:54] <johnkpaul> lint will go nuts on any minified js
[09:13:56] <johnkpaul> and that's a good thing
[09:14:09] <Sicp> alright, it's fine now
[09:16:13] <johnkpaul> Sicp: good
[09:17:50] <aJacom> hi, is this correct? $(this).children('#dk_container_location li.dk_option_current a').attr('data-dk-dropdown-value');
[09:18:30] <Sicp> meaning there's a link inside an li which is inside that div?
[09:18:56] <aJacom> yes, but I don't know if I can use .children() that way
[09:19:05] <haygus> Hey, it exists an evenv to handle a form ? whene data should be sent ?
[09:19:09] <Sicp> I don't know either but it doesn't look right
[09:19:21] <aJacom> haygus, yes, this is for a form submision
[09:19:28] <haygus> exactly
[09:19:44] <haygus> I identtified my form, want a listener
[09:19:59] <haygus> hmmm .submit
[09:21:02] <xec_> aJacom: no .children() will only look at immediate children
[09:21:11] <xec_> aJacom: you probably want .find()
[09:21:13] <aJacom> xec_, what should I use in this case
[09:21:15] <aJacom> alright! :) thanks
[09:21:38] <aJacom> it goes DOWN the DOM tree right ?
[09:21:46] <aJacom> because there are other forms with the same layout
[09:21:56] <aJacom> yes it does
[09:22:00] <xec_> yes .find() will look at descendants
[09:30:02] <RabSimpson> hi folks
[09:30:13] <RabSimpson> i have this form with 2 radio buttons in it - http://pastebin.com/KeFH386b
[09:30:30] <RabSimpson> how can i make sure that number 1 is always checked? the default is 2
[09:32:16] <termite> RabSimpson:number one is checked by default http://jsfiddle.net/5CCCA/
[09:32:21] <mattLUSH> can someone PLEASE help me.. this was working yesterday, and now it doesnt http://pastebin.com/1aHtbd4v
[09:32:38] <RabSimpson> termite it's checked by default in the code in my paste
[09:32:49] <RabSimpson> termite ordinarily it's 2
[09:32:51] <mattLUSH> it doesnt not load more anymore
[09:34:04] <termite> RabSimpson:you can just keep it the way it is in html
[09:34:06] <termite> RabSimpson:
[09:34:15] <termite> RabSimpson:do you want to set it in query?
[09:34:50] <mattLUSH> can anyone help please.. http://pastebin.com/1aHtbd4v
[09:35:13] <RabSimpson> termite i'm probably not making this clear. i can't access the html directly and the default is to have number 2 checked, so i'd like to load in some jquery at the top of the page in order to change it from 2 to 1.
[09:35:36] <termite> ahh ok
[09:35:56] <RabSimpson> termite sorry for any confusion previously
[09:36:13] <docmur> If I run the code $.post( "file.php", data );  it works and loads the php file, if I use the code $('#divid').load("file.php",data); it does't even call file.php, what would cause this to happen?
[09:36:26] <codeshah> hey guys, using jquery reveal, but google maps don't show up properly .. I am using a button onclick to render google maps in the modal reveal. I assume it is because there is some conflict ?
[09:36:38] <codeshah> Maybe I should try to load it after the div is loaded? How do i check when a div is ready
[09:36:51] <mattLUSH> im attempting to load 5 more, it calls the page but doesnt append to the div... http://pastebin.com/1aHtbd4v
[09:38:28] <termite> RabSimpson:$("input[name='screen_columns']").first().attr("checked", "checked");​
[09:38:35] <termite> http://jsfiddle.net/5CCCA/1/
[09:39:23] <RabSimpson> termite thanks but neither is checked in the fiddle
[09:39:24] <faraway> mattLUSH: well i would guess that the id you set for the elements is 1 ... 5 and not load1 ... load5  but form code i cannot verify this
[09:39:50] <termite> http://jsfiddle.net/5CCCA/2/ the first one is checked
[09:39:52] <faraway> mattLUSH: ah sorry didn'T see the one div
[09:40:21] <peterschmidler> Anyone has an idea how to mae the container here draggable? http://codepen.io/peterschmidler/pen/BaGjm
[09:41:20] <mattLUSH> faraway: its ok, the weird part is that this worked fine yesterday, both when you scroll and when you clicked.. now if i click Inspect Element/Resources shows that the indexload.php is called, and its the right page, it just doesnt show
[09:41:46] <Stratus3D> anyone know the solution to this:
[09:41:46] <Stratus3D> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12516581/how-do-i-access-an-array-object-contain-a-list-of-files-staged-for-upload-in-the
[09:43:11] <mattLUSH> can anyone see why its not loading or showing the php page? http://pastebin.com/1aHtbd4v
[09:44:37] <RabSimpson> termite thanks again but it doesn't seem to be working at my end. here's what i've got http://pastebin.com/gDK0YuMn
[09:44:53] <RabSimpson> termite it's loading into wordpress hence the conflict avoidance
[09:45:55] <termite> RabSimpson: make sure the name is correct
[09:46:09] <RabSimpson> the input name?
[09:46:28] <termite> yeah
[09:46:45] <RabSimpson> it's all exactly as was in my first paste
[09:47:13] <termite> do you know how to use a browser debugger
[09:47:42] <termite> if so set a breakpoint right at that line
[09:47:57] <termite> then type $("input[name='screen_columns']").first() in the console
[09:48:07] <termite> and see the result
[09:48:21] <RabSimpson> i've got firebug, what do i need to do?
[09:49:10] <termite> set a breakpoint
[09:49:21] <termite> at the new code
[09:49:43] <termite> then refresh
[09:50:11] <RabSimpson> no idea how to set a breakpoint
[09:50:15] <RabSimpson> back in a sec
[09:50:32] <mattLUSH> hey termite, do you think you could take a look at my script?
[09:50:52] <termite> sure where is it I saw it fly by
[09:51:04] <mattLUSH> http://pastebin.com/1aHtbd4v
[09:51:24] <mattLUSH> it should load 5 more from another php page, which works, its just not showing
[09:51:34] <mattLUSH> in action: http://www.theagendi.com/resources/page/index.php
[09:54:28] <termite> just a tip, you should look into templates.  Using php to generate html van get really messy fast
[09:55:00] <mattLUSH> ok i will, im still a noobie at jQuery
[09:55:28] <RabSimpson> termite thanks for your help, but i've managed to work out a way of doing it by editing the wordpress user meta. thanks again :)
[09:56:22] <termite> mattLUSH: are you sure the success function is being called
[09:56:39] <mattLUSH> termite: how can i tell?
[09:57:04] <termite> I would set a breakpoint there and make sure it's getting called and html is what you expect
[09:57:23] <termite> do you know how to use your browser debugger
[09:57:52] <mattLUSH> termite: not really i have been Inspecting Elements on Chrome, thats all
[09:58:53] <termite> mattLUSH:  You really need to know how to use it.  Click on the scripts section and find your code and set a breakpoint
[09:59:14] <termite> if you don't know how to do it take the time and learn it will save you tons of time in the long run
[10:01:32] <mattLUSH> termite: i added an alert to success, is that what you mean?
[10:03:29] <robde> hello, i have two questions: what is the difference between $something and something; how can I select some child elements with a certain css class of the current element like $('this .active')?
[10:05:29] <termite> nope but that will work for now
[10:05:48] <termite> just google chrome developer tools and read up on break points
[10:05:55] <termite> so does the alert work
[10:06:04] <Gho5t> 1) One is a variable called "$something" the other is a variable called "something". "$" is usually used to indicate it is a jQuery wrapped object. 2) $('#foo').children('.bar');
[10:06:06] <docmur> If I run the code $.post( "file.php", data );  it works and loads the php file, if I use the code $('#divid').load("file.php",data); it does't even call file.php, what would cause this to happen?
[10:06:25] <mattLUSH> termite: the alert doesnt work
[10:07:03] <termite> mattLUSH: yeah the ajax is falling add an error:function(){} section and find out why
[10:07:39] <robde> Gho5t: thank you.
[10:08:02] <termite> mattLUSH:you can also look in the network section of chrome developer tools and look at the request
[10:09:10] <raj`> shoky, can I get your opinion?
[10:10:44] <ericandrewlewis> what does #foo[0] mean as a selector?
[10:11:13] <termite> docmur: .load wants to used get but using the data object freaks it out
[10:11:15] <mattLUSH> it says the request was canceled .. as i said im new to javascript so im not sure how to add the error function termite .. sorry if im wasting time
[10:12:05] <docmur> what? I don't understand.  I don't care if the JS uses get or post, it doesn't matter when change.php gets called.  I'm just wondering why it fails
[10:12:15] <termite> mattLUSH: can you call the ajax url from the browser
[10:12:34] <ericandrewlewis> is that a regex-like range?
[10:13:10] <termite> docmur: if you are going to send a data object you need to use .post load won't work
[10:13:12] <mattLUSH> termite: yes and it works
[10:14:12] <termite> docmur: just use post and on success just use .html() to load it into your target
[10:14:24] <docmur> that can't be true because in another file I have the code $('#status').load('change.php', data);  Where var data = $('#form').serialize() which is all it is in the question I have and it calls it perfectly
[10:15:43] <termite> docmur: and what does serialize do? It creates a string not an object
[10:16:02] <docmur> yes which is what I'm tryign to pass to change.php
[10:16:11] <docmur> *process.php
[10:16:46] <tdlguiinstall> .
[10:16:47] <tdlguiinstall> .
[10:16:54] <tdlguiinstall> .
[10:16:55] <tdlguiinstall> .
[10:16:56] <termite> and it's in the a=1&b=2&c=3&d=4&e=5 format
[10:17:01] <docmur> yes
[10:17:19] <termite> ok that is odd.
[10:17:41] <aJacom[ghost]> how to I redirect after a form submit? I'm using preventdefault but that's preventing the form from actually sending the values...
[10:18:35] <termite> docmur: you know the response is valid html?
[10:19:11] <docmur> yes, it's not even calling the php file, if I use a debugger and set the break at the top of file, the break never gets tripped
[10:19:46] <termite> docmur: hmm this isn't a cross domain request is it
[10:20:16] <docmur> no process.php is in the same directory that index.php is in, the file making the load request
[10:20:25] <lahwran_> this should be completely unnecessary, right? https://gist.github.com/ebd1b1775d0c1083eaa8
[10:21:45] <termite> docmur: hmm so the dev tools in your browser says it never attempts the call
[10:22:04] <shoky> raj ?
[10:22:08] <peterschmidler> I have several images on one page of which one has the class 'active'. How can I find out which image index it has?
[10:22:20] <docmur> well it never shows process.php being accessed, so in effect never being called.
[10:23:25] <termite> docmur:: There is a difference.  If the browser attempts to call it but php never runs then it's a server issue.  If the browser never calls then it's a client issue
[10:23:58] <docmur> well if I use $.post() you can see the devtool accessing it / making calls to it
[10:24:03] <docmur> which it should do even if I use load
[10:24:25] <termite> docmur: but load uses GET and your server may filter that out
[10:24:45] <docmur> but then it should also filter that in the other files which it doesn't
[10:25:30] <docmur> doesn't really matter as $.post will do the job
[10:25:33] <docmur> just very strange
[10:25:40] <termite> docmur:ok stupid question can you make the call in the browser url
[10:26:00] <docmur> yes I can manaully post data to the php file
[10:27:11] <kkuno> guys
[10:27:15] <kkuno> firefox is so slow :|
[10:27:35] <kkuno> 2.5x slow on my script :|
[10:27:39] <kkuno> this is depressing
[10:27:40] <termite> docmur: $('#divid').load("file.php",data); divid is valid right
[10:27:45] <docmur> yep
[10:28:24] <docmur> I had a problem yesterday like this but it just went away after like 2 hours
[10:28:35] <termite> hmm don't know I would need to see the actually website 
[10:28:44] <termite> it's it publicy available
[10:29:10] <lahwran_> ahem
[10:29:12] <lahwran_> this should be completely unnecessary, right? https://gist.github.com/ebd1b1775d0c1083eaa8
[10:29:35] <lahwran_> anyone?
[10:29:39] <termite> lahwran:yes
[10:29:45] <rgr> can one test the return from a jquery function like .text() in a selector without using filter()?
[10:29:47] <lahwran_> okay, thanks for verifying
[10:30:21] <raj> can jqui tabs be in a dropdown list?
[10:36:04] <mattLUSH> termite: i can make a breakpoint.. but i dont know what to do next...
[10:36:32] <xec_> step over?
[10:36:36] <xec_> :D
[10:36:43] <termite> mattLUSH:refresh and see if it reaches the breakpoint
[10:36:59] <monk12> hello all, is there a way to break on events in Firebug... I wanted to use 'Break on Next'  but want to avoid how jquery calls itself every second (think it has a timer event).
[10:37:31] <monk12> my drop down when i click it to show the drop down is immedately closing. so want to figure out whats cuasing that
[10:37:34] <mattLUSH> termite: it does
[10:37:44] <termite> monk12: don't know about firebug but you can in chrome
[10:38:17] <pacific-blue> I want to send some json via ajax to a php program and receive some back. Is there a skeleton like example of this somewhere I could use as a foundation?
[10:38:30] <TelFiRE> Is there some accessibility or other reason to use a big ol library for rollover menus? Or is it just fine to use hoverintent and just have it appear when they hover over it
[10:38:33] <monk12> monk12, how it chrome would it avoid the main jquery timer thing?
[10:38:35] <termite> mattLUSH: if you hit escape (in chrome) you should get the console you can type in variable names and expressions and it will give you the values
[10:38:38] <monk12> termite^
[10:38:56] <pacific-blue> I looked at the jquery.com site but they only suggest books as tutorials
[10:39:08] <mattLUSH> termite: ok
[10:39:26] <robde> could it be that once I have an element like var $e = $('.myclass'); and I change the dom $e updates the css query in real-time??
[10:40:28] <termite> monk12: you can setup event listener breakpoints if that is what you are talking about
[10:42:43] <TelFiRE> Is there any reason not to just do a hover intent and slidetoggle for a rollover menu? Or is there more to it that makes it better to use a library or something?
[10:42:43] <termite> it's in the script section
[10:48:05] <peterschmidler> Who can hint me to a way of making the container draggable in here: http://codepen.io/peterschmidler/pen/BaGjm
[10:53:01] <mattLUSH> termite: the ajax works because its sending the variable of the last #id to the load.php .. its just not appending the html to my div .. not understanding how to debug this...
[10:54:08] <termite> mattLUSH: 1. first make sure the html you are sending back is valid html
[10:54:34] <raj> can jqui tabs be in a dropdown list?
[10:55:13] <termite> mattLUSH: 2. Make sure you can make the call from the browser url
[10:56:06] <termite> mattLUSH: 3. make sure the #id you are trying to load stuff into is valid and doesn't have css that is hiding it
[10:57:04] <termite> mattLUSH: 4. make the ajax call in javascript  and go to the network tab and see if it fails
[10:58:29] <innociv__> How should I check that someone can access a url?  I'm trying to connect with websockets to example.org:843 but some ISPs or networks block port 843.  How could I do a test to see if someone can access with port 843?  Then I could have it use an alternative method on port 80 instead.
[11:01:05] <termite> innociv__: telnet example.org 843
[11:02:08] <innociv__> termite, javascript can telnet?
[11:03:35] <termite> innociv__: just messing with you
[11:03:39] <termite> :)
[11:03:48] <innociv__> Yeah
[11:04:36] <hariom> How to test if dialog plugin is downloaded in jquery UI?
[11:05:33] <hariom> How to test if dialog plugin is downloaded in jquery UI?
[11:06:36] <danheberden> $.ui.dialog
[11:06:53] <danheberden> if ( $.ui.dialog ) { /* harium zomg! */ }
[11:07:44] <JyZyXEL> whats the opposite of .append()?
[11:07:52] <termite> prepend
[11:07:59] <prs> what do you mean opposite?
[11:08:03] <mattLUSH> termite: in network, its redirected to the right page, variable works, css is fine, but Status says  canceled
[11:08:16] <JyZyXEL> so if i do append('a') how do i end the link?
[11:08:30] <innociv__> I can't check it with $.ajax() because it's a "cross original request". Any ideas?
[11:08:35] <innociv__> Since the port is different
[11:09:11] <termite> innociv__: are you using socket IO
[11:09:29] <innociv__> Yes.  And some people have networks blocking port 843
[11:09:38] <termite> ohh i know trust me
[11:09:46] <innociv__> So I want to connect to a load balancer on port 80 for those cases.
[11:09:52] <stewbydoo> how can I check if a radio button has been selected?
[11:10:06] <innociv__> isn't it :checked like check boxes?
[11:10:16] <innociv__> termite, any insight? :D
[11:10:41] <stewbydoo> I am trying to check if a user has selected a radio button and then what radio button they have selected
[11:10:41] <mattLUSH> think i might just give up because none of this makes sense..
[11:10:41] <robde> could it be once I have an element like var $e = $('.myclass'); and I change the DOM, that $e updates according to the changes in real-time?? so if I add another element with the same class $e contains it too?
[11:11:06] <innociv__> I currently already have a way to connect to port 80 for socket.io.  The thing is that for some people 843 works best, and for a few 843 doesn't work an only 80 does.  So I need to send people to port 80 when 843 doesn't work.
[11:11:12] <innociv__> I can't figure out how to check if 843 works or not.
[11:11:12] <danheberden> stewbydoo: either $(theRadio).is(':checked') or $(theRadio).prop('checked')
[11:11:28] <termite> mattLUSH: sorry but it's hard to tell without seeing the site
[11:11:31] <JyZyXEL> .append('a').append('a') is not working that great
[11:11:31] <b-ot> JyZyXEL, memorised “append('a').append('a')”.
[11:11:42] <JyZyXEL> there would need to be a </a> in between
[11:11:44] <mattLUSH> termite: http://www.theagendi.com/resources/page/index.php
[11:12:10] <andress> hey guys for some reazon im sending an input file when i serialize my form
[11:12:18] <andress> im not
[11:12:21] <andress> sorry
[11:13:39] <mattLUSH> termite: in network it shows the page being calldd but for some reason its cancelled
[11:14:11] <JyZyXEL> how do i end a link?
[11:14:23] <JyZyXEL> after .append('a')
[11:14:33] <stewbydoo> if($("input[name=colorscheme]").is(":checked")){
[11:14:34] <stewbydoo>                                         alert("imhere");
[11:14:34] <stewbydoo>                                         
[11:14:34] <stewbydoo>                                 }
[11:14:39] <stewbydoo> sorry
[11:14:49] <stewbydoo> this is not working
[11:16:56] <termite> mattLUSH: all I can say after seeing the code is you are way in over your head.
[11:17:52] <mattLUSH> termite: yeah i think im just gonna give up, it worked yesterday and now all of a sudden it doesnt work at all. i dont get it..
[11:18:15] <stewbydoo> probably something small
[11:18:21] <termite> strip everything out and put it back in one section at a time
[11:20:52] <stewbydoo> anybody can help me?
[11:21:09] <stewbydoo> if($("input[name=colorscheme]").is(":checked")){alert("imhere");}
[11:21:15] <stewbydoo> this is not working
[11:21:51] <innociv__> termite, so you don't know what I should do to check if a client can connect through port 843?
[11:21:53] <termite> innociv__: I would just switch it to run on port 8080
[11:22:54] <JyZyXEL> how do you end a link in jq?
[11:23:35] <kristofers> is this correct ?
[11:23:38] <kristofers> $("wrap").addClass("container");
[11:24:16] <termite> $("#wrap").addClass("container"); if #wrap is the id
[11:24:51] <JyZyXEL> how do you make jquery produce a </a> after a link?
[11:25:48] <termite> JyZyXEL: do you mean $("<a>hi there</a>") to create a link
[11:26:03] <JyZyXEL> to end the link
[11:26:47] <anildigital> What is the issue with code? ajax not getting fired https://gist.github.com/71b02cc9346583c3186a
[11:26:49] <anildigital> halp
[11:26:51] <devslash2> Why does this return undefined?  http://jsfiddle.net/SXrAu/
[11:27:21] <JyZyXEL> for when your in the middle of your link code: tr.append('td').append('a').text().attr().attr()
[11:27:27] <JyZyXEL> how do you END it
[11:27:32] <JyZyXEL> so that the link closes
[11:27:39] <JyZyXEL> a </a> is need
[11:27:45] <JyZyXEL> but how do you make it?
[11:28:08] <NoiseEee> JyZyXEL: termite just told you.
[11:28:28] <NoiseEee> JyZyXEL: tr.append($('<td>')) etc
[11:28:51] <devslash2>  anyone know why it's returning undefined
[11:28:57] <JyZyXEL> you mean .append($('</a>'))
[11:29:30] <termite> devslash2:lert($("#editprefixes").selectedIndex);
[11:29:34] <termite> no pound
[11:29:36] <termite> #
[11:29:52] <devslash2> I did that it returns undefined
[11:30:56] <termite> hold on fixing it
[11:31:01] <devslash2> Ok
[11:31:08] <robde> hello, i have a problem with this: I have an element $e = $('.active'); and an element $l = $('not-active'); if I do $l.addClass(
[11:31:18] <robde> 'active');
[11:31:21] <JyZyXEL> it didnt work
[11:31:31] <robde> $e changes both
[11:31:53] <robde> so $e.css('display', 'none'); has an effect on both
[11:31:54] <JyZyXEL> i tried: tr.append('td').append('a').text().attr().attr().append($('</a>')).append('a').text().attr()'
[11:32:01] <JyZyXEL> the second link does not show up
[11:32:39] <CodesStuff> devslash2: use id="editprefixes"
[11:32:43] <CodesStuff> and console.log($("#editprefixes").prop("selectedIndex"));
[11:33:03] <JyZyXEL> how do i specify i DO NOT want the link inside the other one
[11:33:08] <JyZyXEL> i want the link NEXT TO THE OTHER ONE
[11:33:17] <CodesStuff> after?
[11:33:20] <JyZyXEL> yeah
[11:33:32] <CodesStuff> no i mean
[11:33:33] <CodesStuff> http://api.jquery.com/after/
[11:33:39] <devslash2> Still undefined
[11:34:25] <CodesStuff> no, devslash: http://jsfiddle.net/UpyPx/
[11:34:27] <CodesStuff> This
[11:34:42] <JyZyXEL> how would that work?
[11:34:54] <JyZyXEL> i tried changing the .append() to .after()
[11:35:03] <CodesStuff> JyZyXEL, do you have a jsfiddle for me to play with?
[11:35:05] <JyZyXEL> and i tried .appeding TO THE .after
[11:35:12] <JyZyXEL> whats a jsfiddle
[11:35:17] <termite> devslash: CodeStuff beat me to it
[11:35:18] <CodesStuff> http://jsfiddle.net/

[11:35:21] <termite> same thing
[11:35:36] <CodesStuff> termite: Mess with the best etc :P
[11:35:36] <JyZyXEL> no that looks complicated
[11:35:50] <JyZyXEL> were talking about having to links next to eachother
[11:35:56] <JyZyXEL> this shouldn't be very hard.....
[11:36:12] <termite> CodesStuff: haha more like try and answer 5 questions and do work and mess with the best
[11:36:17] <devslash2> Ok thanks
[11:36:32] <termite> CodesStuff: :)
[11:37:16] <CodesStuff> Okay, so select the parent element, JyZyXEL, and do and :last or whatever
[11:37:31] <JyZyXEL> how would that look?
[11:37:34] <CodesStuff> or just manually add the tag with .html()
[11:38:12] <CodesStuff> $('#parent_element').html($('#parent_element').html() + "<a href='#'>I hate Joomla</a>");
[11:38:16] <CodesStuff> ghetto way to do it
[11:38:18] <CodesStuff> lolol
[11:38:32] <JyZyXEL> what the heck no
[11:38:36] <JyZyXEL> that not at all what it looks like
[11:39:08] <CodesStuff> Well you won't give me a fucking jsfiddle.
[11:39:15] <JyZyXEL> tr.append('td').append('a').text().attr().attr().append('a').text().attr()
[11:39:17] <JyZyXEL> there
[11:39:21] <JyZyXEL> thats what i have now
[11:39:26] <kristofers> How can you troubleshoot the problem with jquery, if your not getting any errors in firebug, and the function isn't doing anything ?

[11:56:46] <devslash2> My input was pasted into the fiddle
[11:59:41] <devslash2> In my code its saying $("myelement") is null

[12:03:43] <devslash2> I don't have a script tag is included jquery in my script
[12:04:12] <arielserafini> you pasted the jquery minified code inside your script?

[12:28:13] <JyZyXEL> links
[12:30:44] <adav> ?
[12:31:03] <JyZyXEL> how do i append empty space?
[12:31:10] <JyZyXEL> like a single SPC or something
[12:31:17] <Jon47> JyZyXEL: links are usually inline
[12:31:23] <Jon47> you can add an actual space character..
[12:31:29] <JyZyXEL> how do you append it?
[12:31:31] <Jon47> or make them inline-block and put padding or marign
[12:31:43] <JyZyXEL> like how do you append actual text?
[12:31:51] <Jon47> :before / :after pseudo-elements might work, never tried it for that reason
[12:31:58] <Jon47> i dunno if they take up space in the document
[12:32:12] <Jon47> if they are on inline elements they might?
[12:32:38] <Zzaichik> inline elements do not
[12:32:51] <JyZyXEL> whats the append argument for just text?
[12:32:52] <Jon47> btw, ::before ::after are the proper syntax but the single-colon versions work in more browsers
[12:33:21] <JyZyXEL> i wanna append a single ' '
[12:33:24] <JyZyXEL> SPC character
[12:33:31] <JyZyXEL> or something
[12:33:36] <JyZyXEL> what makes a space in html
[12:33:45] <Zzaichik> &nbsp;
[12:34:01] <JyZyXEL> can i do .append('&nbsp;');
[12:34:28] <Zzaichik> sure
[12:34:31] <JyZyXEL> it didn't work
[12:35:05] <Zzaichik> can you append anything? like throw a letter in there
[12:35:14] <Gho5t> $('a.foo').text( $(a.foo').text() + ' ' );
[12:35:18] <innociv__> termite, doesn't work for many firewalls
[12:35:18] <innociv__> tried that
[12:35:52] <JyZyXEL> no you cant
[12:35:56] <JyZyXEL> 'a'
[12:36:01] <JyZyXEL> would make and <a>
[12:36:06] <Zzaichik> and it's not appending that a?
[12:36:11] <Gho5t> waht
[12:36:13] <JyZyXEL> yes i would
[12:36:22] <Gho5t> $('a.foo').text( $('a.foo').text() + ' ' );
[12:36:26] <Zzaichik> ^^
[12:36:26] <Gho5t> sorry forgot a quote
[12:36:34] <JyZyXEL> what is a.foo
[12:36:40] <Gho5t> ...
[12:36:43] <Zzaichik> holy baby jesus..
[12:36:43] <JyZyXEL> i want &nbsp;
[12:36:47] <Gho5t> jQuery 101
[12:37:21] <Zzaichik> $('a.foo').text( $('a.foo').text() + ' ' );  && $('a.foo').text( $('a.foo').text() + '&nbsp;' ); should do the same thing.
[12:37:31] <Zzaichik> replace a.foo with your element
[12:38:05] <Zzaichik> actually no - it won't. but you get the idea?
[12:38:46] <JyZyXEL> your probably gonna get the SPC inside the link
[12:38:50] <JyZyXEL> and it will be underlined
[12:39:10] <madprops> can I store data variables on any kind of object? For example I'm using a scrollbar library called nicescroll, I activate it with $('#foo').niceScroll() and I can get it with x = $('#foo').getNiceScroll() ... can I store  data in x? like x.data('something') ?
[12:39:11] <JyZyXEL> the &nbsp; needs to be between the links
[12:39:22] <Zzaichik> so you want to append a &nbsp; to the end of the <a>
[12:39:48] <Zzaichik> $('element').append('&nbsp;');
[12:40:15] <Gho5t> madprops: you can add properties to an object at anytime yes
[12:41:04] <harbhub> hey fellas
[12:41:15] <harbhub> i'm trying to do something using jquery, and could use some help
[12:41:29] <harbhub> so far what i have done is that i made an html input with a type of text
[12:41:51] <harbhub> i have a jquery selector that targets the input element, and listens for the keydown event
[12:41:52] <Zzaichik> JyZyXEL:   $('.classname').after('&nbsp;');
[12:42:07] <Bish_> im just trying to add a send button to facebook, could someone tell me why textarea.trigger($.Event("keydown",{keyCode:13}));
[12:42:12] <Bish_> doesn't work?
[12:42:20] <harbhub> when the keydown event occurs, i have a jquery selector grabbing an empty P element
[12:42:38] <JyZyXEL> none of that shit works
[12:42:50] <harbhub> i use the jquery html function to alter it to output 'This has been typed into!'
[12:43:05] <Zzaichik> JyZyXEL: That shit works just fine for me man
[12:43:07] <JyZyXEL> it doesn't work between td.append('a')'s
[12:43:15] <Gho5t> JyZyXEL: do you even know how to use jQuery
[12:43:17] <Zzaichik> It isn't the code...
[12:43:18] <JyZyXEL> just destroys the whole rest of the table
[12:43:22] <harbhub> my goal, however, is to make the P element output the actual keydown event that occured
[12:43:23] <JyZyXEL> Gho5t: no i've never used it
[12:43:32] <Gho5t> so maybe...you're wrong here?
[12:43:33] <harbhub> so that you can see what the person types as the type it
[12:43:44] <harbhub> any advice fellas?
[12:43:47] <JyZyXEL> modifying written jquery code is a nightmare
[12:43:47] <Gho5t> harbhub: how bout a concise question
[12:43:56] <harbhub> ok
[12:44:09] <simple__> I'm having a hard time getting events to fire in proper order.   Not sure what i am doing.   currently, I print into a document.ready() function, but I have a google map that is built and points added that also use document.ready().    even with the final event I want to fire at the bottom of the page, it is firing before all the points are added and the map isn't even loaded by that time.   Can someone explain this to me?
[12:44:17] <Cryp71c> Trying to use jquery ui's autocomplete, is there a way to specify a javascript function as the source?
[12:44:34] <harbhub> how do you use jquery to edit a P element to show whatever someone is typing into a text field (html input of type text)
[12:44:41] <harbhub> Gho5t:  ^ that
[12:44:59] <Gho5t> JyZyXEL: http://jsfiddle.net/LJRwS/
[12:45:39] <Gho5t> harbhub: there isn't a native function of course, but yes, use the keydown() event of the input and append the text to the P
[12:45:55] <harbhub> okay so that last part
[12:45:59] <harbhub> append to the text
[12:46:19] <harbhub> right now all i got accomplished was the html of P to say 'this was typed into'
[12:46:35] <harbhub> can we make a fiddle?
[12:46:40] <Gho5t> yes please start one
[12:47:34] <raj> how do I select all child elements of an element?
[12:47:40] <devslash> in my code I do this to set the value of an <input> field: $("StartTime1").value = "foo" but it doesnt get set. if i put that in firebug, it changes the value of the input field
[12:47:45] <raj> all child elements of $('.abc')
[12:48:18] <Gho5t> devslash: that's not valid jQuery
[12:48:36] <devslash> then how do i do it ?
[12:48:46] <Gho5t> there is no html element called StartTime1
[12:48:46] <devslash> ive tried EVERYthing and nothing seems to work
[12:48:52] <Gho5t> perhaps #StartTime1
[12:48:56] <Gho5t> or .StartTime1
[12:48:56] <devslash> no
[12:49:03] <devslash> #startTime1 is null
[12:49:04] <Gho5t> also it's val() not value
[12:49:13] <Gho5t> oh ok
[12:49:20] <Gho5t> so you must just have to drop the hash then
[12:49:29] <Gho5t> then it fixes it like magic
[12:49:37] <devslash> its defined as <input value="" id="StartTime1" name="StartTime1">
[12:49:45] <Gho5t> k bud
[12:49:50] <simple__> is there a way to get a function to fire VERY last when using document.ready()?
[12:49:51] <Gho5t> it's $('#StartTime1')
[12:50:01] <devslash> in firebug that returns null
[12:50:03] <Gho5t> make sure you have the code within $(document).ready()
[12:50:06] <devslash> it is
[12:50:13] <Gho5t> you check the lenght
[12:50:18] <devslash> of what
[12:50:21] <devslash> the text?
[12:50:23] <Gho5t> $('#StartTime1').length
[12:50:27] <devslash> null
[12:50:38] <Gho5t> well obviously something else is wrong
[12:50:42] <Gho5t> like it doesn't exist
[12:50:43] <devslash> i dont know
[12:50:59] <devslash> could it be because my script is part of a greasemonkey script
[12:51:01] <Gho5t> i assure you , grabbing something by id in jQuery is pretty reliable
[12:51:13] <devslash> when i did document.getElementBy it worked fine
[12:52:01] <devslash> something is wrong with jquery
[12:52:08] <harbhub> http://jsfiddle.net/BDXZ8/2/   Gho5t
[12:53:02] <harbhub> Gho5t:  so where do we go from here?
[12:53:12] <Gho5t> harbhub: first step is to wrap this in document ready
[12:53:21] <harbhub> well
[12:53:21] <devslash> Gho5t any idea
[12:53:27] <harbhub> it is wrapped in document.onload
[12:53:31] <harbhub> by the fiddle
[12:53:37] <harbhub> but okay lets wrap that bad boy up
[12:53:39] <harbhub> i'll do it
[12:54:39] <harbhub> http://jsfiddle.net/BDXZ8/5/  Gho5t
[12:54:45] <Zzaichik> harbhub: http://jsfiddle.net/BDXZ8/4/
[12:54:45] <harbhub> wrapped her up
[12:55:23] <harbhub> Zzaichik:  doesnt do anything for me since i had already updated mine past v4
[12:55:29] <harbhub> can you re-update that?
[12:56:01] <harbhub> unless all you did was make it have doc ready, in which case i already did that in v5
[12:56:17] <harbhub> also, would this work with a textarea?  i'm going to test that out, too
[12:57:45] <harbhub> Gho5t Zzaichik:  what's the verdict?
[12:57:54] <Gho5t> http://jsfiddle.net/BDXZ8/8/
[12:58:01] <Gho5t> harbhub: ^
[12:59:08] <harbhub> ok so you used event.which to input the keycode and read the char
[12:59:22] <harbhub> then pop it into the text by adding it to the text that exists
[12:59:30] <harbhub> but
[12:59:44] <harbhub> well first off, that is awesome
[12:59:45] <harbhub> but
[13:00:18] <harbhub> can we have the entire contents in the input text be what is displayed, and it updates as a change occurs?
[13:00:27] <Zzaichik> http://jsfiddle.net/BDXZ8/9/
[13:00:33] <Zzaichik> there you go harbhub
[13:01:14] <harbhub> so event.which is the keycode
[13:01:19] <devslash> Gho5t i  figured out what was wrong
[13:01:24] <harbhub> when it equals 13(pressed enter)
[13:01:29] <Zzaichik> 13 is the keycode
[13:01:33] <Zzaichik> right
[13:01:39] <harbhub> then we cre appending(adding on) the text contained in the field
[13:01:56] <harbhub> so .val()
[13:02:05] <harbhub> is that value of the text input field
[13:02:11] <Zzaichik> right
[13:02:22] <harbhub> cool
[13:02:30] <harbhub> btw do you guys work as programmers?
[13:03:08] <harbhub> i like how Gho5t and Zzaichik both had different interpretations & solutions to the problem
[13:03:20] <harbhub> thank you both
[13:03:24] <Gho5t> i'm a housewife
[13:03:34] <Zzaichik> There's probably a few different ways still, that it could be done.
[13:03:44] <Zzaichik> yw
[13:03:55] <Zzaichik> Yes, I'm a developer
[13:04:13] <harbhub> housewife and developer, you should get married hehe
[13:04:52] <harbhub> Zzaichik:  how did you procure a job as a developer?  are you freelance or company salaried employee?  (don't answer if this is too personal)
[13:05:45] <Gho5t> there are like 50 jobs on every city's craigslist
[13:05:52] <Gho5t> and a ton more on dice
[13:06:08] <harbhub> sweet
[13:06:14] <harbhub> i want to make a living as a developer
[13:06:14] <Zzaichik> harbhub: I am both.
[13:06:15] <Gho5t> how old ar eyou
[13:06:19] <harbhub> 23
[13:06:25] <Gho5t> still in school?
[13:06:27] <harbhub> i graduate with a degree in civil engineering this december
[13:06:32] <harbhub> bachelors
[13:06:33] <Gho5t> ehh
[13:06:37] <Gho5t> and you want to be a developer?
[13:06:41] <synapt> civil engineerin...
[13:06:43] <Gho5t> kinda a waste of time then aye
[13:06:45] <synapt> Gho5t took the words from my mouth
[13:06:46] <synapt> lol
[13:06:50] <harbhub> lol
[13:07:06] <synapt> I mean, people can make A LOT of money in development, but it takes a fair bit of time and learning
[13:07:16] <harbhub> well i learned nodejs
[13:07:21] <synapt> you got a degree in civil engineering, you're probably closer to making a lot more money with that than you will in development any time soon
[13:07:27] <Gho5t> anyone can get paid well as a developer if they get good at js, html/css
[13:07:29] <harbhub> fair enough
[13:07:36] <harbhub> i am good at those!
[13:07:52] <Gho5t> most of the devs I know make 6 figures +
[13:07:58] <Gho5t> the ones that don't are PHP devs
[13:08:05] <Zzaichik> ^^ after years of exp
[13:08:07] <synapt> Node for one thing is one of MANY languages around, it's also still pretty fresh and new and you don't really see sites, especially large scale ones using it
[13:08:15] <harbhub> doing what kind dev work do the bread winners do that you know?
[13:08:21] <synapt> Gho5t: PHP developers will pull 6 figures easily as well, issue is there are -so many- PHP developers, and most are horrible
[13:08:36] <Gho5t> well learning something like .NET or Java
[13:08:42] <harbhub> hey jquery/javascript question
[13:08:46] <harbhub> ew java
[13:08:49] <harbhub> lol
[13:08:50] <Zzaichik> .NET - gross
[13:08:55] <harbhub> haha
[13:08:57] <synapt> Java is Java, people pay out huge on that regardless, whether for server licenses, or developers :P
[13:08:59] <Gho5t> ASP.NET MVC is not gross
[13:09:07] <synapt> I like .NET for software, but not web
[13:09:08] <harbhub> mvc
[13:09:10] <harbhub> is separate
[13:09:13] <harbhub> from any language
[13:09:16] <synapt> C# is pretty decent if you're doing purely windows stuff, but that's a bit beyond this I think
[13:09:22] <Gho5t> harbhub: incorrect
[13:09:23] <harbhub> i use mvc in xcode and node
[13:09:29] <Gho5t> yes it is a pattern
[13:09:30] <harbhub> model view controller
[13:09:36] <synapt> MVC is a 'style'
[13:09:37] <harbhub> yes it is language independent
[13:09:42] <Gho5t> ...
[13:09:48] <Zzaichik> Well, software - yeah that I can live with. I'd rather not use .NET for web related stuff.
[13:09:48] <Gho5t> ASP.NET MVC is a framework
[13:09:52] <harbhub> what am i missing gho5t?
[13:09:52] <synapt> I say that because it's not something you -have- to use
[13:09:57] <synapt> you're missing that
[13:10:00] <harbhub> got it
[13:10:01] <synapt> he's talking about an actual framework
[13:10:01] <synapt> lol
[13:10:03] <harbhub> yes
[13:10:05] <harbhub> i get that now
[13:10:08] <Gho5t> http://www.asp.net/mvc
[13:10:09] <harbhub> i use Express framework
[13:10:19] <harbhub> which is sinatra-like framework for mvc
[13:10:28] <harbhub> i understand
[13:10:38] <ryanneufeld> ?select
[13:10:39] <bot-t> .select(handler): Bind an event handler to the "select" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/select/
[13:10:40] <harbhub> i just didnt know you meant a specific mvc framework at first
[13:10:56] <Gho5t> asp.net web forms is garbage
[13:11:00] <harbhub> my question is this
[13:11:04] <synapt> personally never been a huge fan of MVC stuff, but I've always been more of a hands on guy
[13:11:17] <harbhub> lets say that we use the previous keydown/keypress event
[13:11:24] <harbhub> can jquery/js make a post request
[13:11:27] <harbhub> based on it?
[13:11:36] <harbhub> that my serverside can then pick up?
[13:11:53] <Gho5t> http://api.jquery.com/ajax
[13:12:09] <Gho5t> http://api.jquery.com/category/ajax/
[13:12:11] <Gho5t> rather
[13:12:50] <harbhub> reading
[13:13:13] <Gho5t> specifically look at $.post
[13:13:14] <harbhub> whoa gho5t
[13:13:19] <harbhub> yeah
[13:13:22] <harbhub> i saw $.get
[13:13:26] <harbhub> and was excited
[13:13:42] <harbhub> so you are telling me that i can receive .get .post requests on the client side
[13:13:54] <harbhub> and handle them on the serverside o.0
[13:13:59] <Gho5t> you can create them on the client side yes
[13:14:24] <harbhub> can i send a .get .port request to the client side from the serverside?
[13:14:33] <harbhub> or does that not make sense?
[13:14:59] <Gho5t> ajax = client requests/submists something from server
[13:15:02] <wachpwnski1> whats the difference between var i =   and $i   ?
[13:15:03] <Gho5t> ajax = client requests/submists something from/to server
[13:15:13] <Gho5t> wachpwnski1: the name
[13:15:27] <Gho5t> $ is usually used to indicate it is a jquery wrapped object
[13:15:39] <xain> I have an odd question
[13:16:02] <leotr> hi! i get TypeError: object has no method 'widget'
[13:16:21] <tab1293> does anyone know of a plugin that is exactly like facebook photo zoom for jquery?
[13:16:39] <leotr> in case if i open page with chrome dev-tools open, but everything is ok if i don't open it. Why?
[13:17:12] <xain> When doing an $('#thing').on('click', function()) it works the first time when writing out an object tag on innerHTML, but it will not fire twice.  Also, it works if I take the <object> and <embed> tags out of writing the innerHTML
[13:18:54] <Bish_> im just trying to add a send button to facebook, could someone tell me why textarea.trigger($.Event("keydown",{keyCode:13}));
[13:19:02] <Bish_> doesn't work?
[13:19:06] <adav> should i need to add my css path in my javascript file in order to use this $(".nom").focus().after("<span class='help-inline'>Ingrese su nombre</span>"); ?
[13:20:12] <harbhub> does $.post only work with PHP?
[13:20:25] <harbhub> i want to use my nodejs with it
[13:21:36] <xain> Is it not firing because I am doing a postback when writing the innerHTML?
[13:21:52] <xain> I am not doing a postback on purpose btw
[13:22:40] <xain> Just if #('#thingy').html('html string') does a postback
[13:25:32] <anavarro> hi there, I'm having problems dealing with a select/option ondblclick event handler
[13:25:34] <wachpwnski1> Gho5t: so if I want a variable accessible by jquery globally i can do $var = 10;  or something?
[13:25:40] <anavarro> particularly on IE8
[13:26:00] <Gho5t> wachpwnski1: no
[13:26:26] <Gho5t> prefixing a variable name with "$" does nothing
[13:26:31] <Gho5t> it's just a convention
[13:26:40] <Gho5t> that means this is a jquery wrapped object
[13:26:53] <Gho5t> var $x = $('#x');
[13:27:10] <harbhub> lol you are just naming the variable '$x'
[13:27:12] <leotr> wachpwnski1, so you don't call that twice
[13:27:15] <harbhub> variable name doesnt do anything
[13:28:57] <anavarro> Is there any well know work around on this issue
[13:29:09] <Bish> :'(
[13:29:46] <leotr> hi! what could be a reason of the following. There is a bookmarklet which attaches a script to body tag, and that script dynamically loads jquery.js and jquery-ui. Dynamic loading is performed using setInterval to ensure that jQuery is loaded before jQuery-ui and third script (selectboxit) loads after them. By some reason i get the following issue... (to be continued)
[13:30:01] <leotr> BTW, after all scripts are loaded i hide jQuery to bookmarklet object (O.jQuery = jQuery.noConflict()). if Chrome Developer Tools are open i get error Object function (a,b){return new p.fn.init(a,b,c)} has no method 'widget' (which is caused by selectboxit.js). That seems strange to me and i can't understand why does it happen. It doesn't happen when Developer Tools are inactive.
[13:37:44] <sisb> hola atcho boi
[13:40:33] <simple__> is there a way of controlling the triggering of events when running scripts in multiple document.ready() on different parts of the page?
[13:48:25] <Bish> im just trying to add a send button to facebook, could someone tell me why textarea.trigger($.Event("keydown",{keyCode:13}));
[13:48:26] <Bish> doesn't work?
[13:59:54] <madprops> is there a way to check if content(urls) inside a div are still loading?
[14:01:51] <NoiseEee> madprops: their callbacks aren't fired?
[14:09:17] <raj> where r the heavy hitters?
[14:11:07] <Eviltwin> We have jobs
[14:12:10] <purefusion> When listening for keypress events, is there an easy way to get the character that was typed, without having to have a lengthy array or json object mapping characters to their respective keycodes?
[14:12:24] <Eviltwin> The ASCII char?
[14:12:32] <purefusion> Eviltwin: yes
[14:12:48] <Eviltwin> purefusion: Check this out: http://www.quirksmode.org/js/keys.html
[14:12:51] <Eviltwin> It explains
[14:12:57] <purefusion> Eviltwin: at least, it's not being printed when printing the event
[14:13:17] <raj> haha, sup Eviltwin? Long time no see
[14:13:52] <Eviltwin> I'm doing well
[14:13:55] <Eviltwin> Been keeping myself busy
[14:14:04] <raj> clearly you have a job
[14:14:05] <raj> ;)
[14:14:05] <raj> brb
[14:15:26] <purefusion> Eviltwin: that page doesn't appear to explain that there is or isn't a way to get the character without having to reference the keycode against a map...
[14:15:55] <purefusion> still a good resource, just doesn't seem to have the answer I'm looking for specifically
[14:15:55] <Eviltwin> purefusion: Read the section under the heading "keyCode and charCode"
[14:17:27] <purefusion> Eviltwin: I don't want codes, I want the characters themselves... sorry for the confusion
[14:17:56] <Eviltwin> purefusion: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/fromCharCode
[14:18:19] <purefusion> Eviltwin: perfect!
[14:18:49] <purefusion> thanks a bunch :)
[14:23:46] <Bish> im just trying to add a send button to facebook, could someone tell me why textarea.trigger($.Event("keydown",{keyCode:13}));
[14:23:48] <Bish> doesn't work?
[14:24:57] <Eviltwin> Bish: Read the first sentence of this document: http://api.jquery.com/trigger/
[14:26:06] <Eviltwin> Also I think trying to programatically submit a form is a ToS violation
[14:26:41] <purefusion> Eviltwin: if I have a list of charCodes in an array, is there a way to pass them into the String.fromCharCode()? I see it accepts several values, but doesn't appear to accept an array successfully.
[14:27:18] <Eviltwin> purefusion: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/apply
[14:27:43] <Eviltwin> foo.bar(1,2,3,4,5) can be written as foo.apply(foo,[1,2,3,4,5])
[14:28:57] <purefusion> ah, I remember using that once
[14:30:32] <purefusion> Eviltwin: did you mean to type foo.apply(bar, [1,2,3,4,5])?
[14:31:14] <rgr> Should an absolute positioned child of an element which overlaps that elements right column not maintain the mouse focus and this prevent the hover out function being triggered when the mouse pointer crosses the right hand column of the parent?
[14:31:29] <Eviltwin> Actually I meant foo.bar.apply(foo,[1,2,3,4,5])
[14:32:03] <Eviltwin> <object>.<function>(<arg1>, <arg2>, ...) becomes <object>.<function>(<object>, [<arg1>, <arg2>, ...])
[14:32:06] <purefusion> Eviltwin: ah, perfect, thanks again :)
[14:32:54] <Eviltwin> <object>.<function>.apply(...
[14:33:02] <Eviltwin> Apparently I can't type that right
[14:35:02] <Eviltwin> Bish: If you didn't figure out the answer to your question based on that sentence, the answer is because Facebook doesn't use jQuery's .bind() to attach event listeners so .trigger() won't trigger them
[14:37:21] <w00tner> hi my friends
[14:37:30] <w00tner> do you know why am i getting this  message: XMLHttpRequest cannot load http://www.cuponaria.com/json/procesar.php. Origin http://cuponaria.com is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Origin.
[14:37:42] <w00tner> in console
[14:37:56] <w00tner> while trying to process an php file with jquery
[14:38:05] <Eviltwin> Is your website http://www.cuponaria.com/ ?
[14:38:15] <Eviltwin> The one that you're making this page on?
[14:38:25] <pnoexz> w00tner: you cant access content from other sites from javascript
[14:38:52] <nmeagher> I am having an issue with jQuery and clearing fields
[14:39:09] <nmeagher> Can someone please look at my code and tell me how I can fix it?
[14:39:19] <nmeagher> The functionality is pretty simple
[14:39:46] <Eviltwin> ?jsf @ nmeagher
[14:39:47] <bot-t> nmeagher, jsFiddle (http://jsfiddle.net) is an online IDE for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is the best way to provide test cases of your jQuery bugs (for support and the bug tracker). Make sure to include the jQuery library (on the left side) and any relevant markup or CSS. You can include external dependencies via the Add Resources tab. You can also mock AJAX requests.
[14:39:56] <Eviltwin> Please put your pretty simple code there
[14:40:00] <w00tner> http://pastebin.com/Jg4MP2Z0
[14:40:04] <Bish> EvilTwin, cool, thank you
[14:40:18] <Eviltwin> w00tner: Okay, this is open in your browser right?
[14:40:23] <Eviltwin> The page that has this?
[14:40:26] <Eviltwin> The one with the console error
[14:40:35] <w00tner> yes this is the page: www.cuponaria.com/json/#alta
[14:40:39] <w00tner> try to send the data
[14:40:52] <nmeagher> Uploading to jsf, sec
[14:40:57] <Eviltwin> And it's http:// not https:// or something
[14:41:04] <w00tner> how am i supussed to insert the data in a mysql db using jquery
[14:41:19] <w00tner> code: http://pastebin.com/Jg4MP2Z0
[14:41:21] <pnoexz> im having an issue with colorbox, i set the rel to 'cb' for all the links that need to open in colorbox, the problem is that its considering it to be a gallery so it shows "image 1 of 2" on top of the html fetched from the link.. this is my code: $('a[rel="cb"]').colorbox({href:siteUrl('users/flogin')}).. any ideas?
[14:41:27] <Eviltwin> jQuery lets you make an HTTP request
[14:41:36] <Eviltwin> HTTP requests can get handled by an HTTP server
[14:41:40] <Eviltwin> Via a language such as PHP
[14:41:44] <Eviltwin> Which can in turn interact with MySQL
[14:41:47] <w00tner> yes
[14:41:51] <nmeagher> Okay here is my jsf: http://jsfiddle.net/R8kma/
[14:41:57] <w00tner> i already have my process.php file
[14:42:03] <w00tner> that inserts the data into a mysql db
[14:42:05] <nmeagher> I am tried to get the value of the text field and then dynamically clear the field
[14:42:13] <w00tner> but i cant get it using $.ajax { type: "POST",
[14:42:13] <w00tner>                                 url: "http://www.cuponaria.com/json/procesar.php",
[14:42:13] <w00tner>                                 data: $(e.formReg).serialize(),
[14:42:42] <Eviltwin> w00tner: Can you open the page with the error, copy the URL bar, and paste it here
[14:43:00] <w00tner> http://cuponaria.com/json/#alta
[14:43:11] <w00tner> XMLHttpRequest cannot load http://www.cuponaria.com/json/procesar.php. Origin http://cuponaria.com is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Origin.
[14:43:23] <Eviltwin> Ah, cuponaria.com is not the same as www.cuponaria.com
[14:43:33] <Eviltwin> I suggest doing url:"/json/procesar.php"
[14:43:48] <w00tner> but its going to be in a native app
[14:44:20] <leotr> why on one browser image width may differ from another browser?
[14:44:25] <w00tner> so it must be a full url
[14:46:33] <w00tner> i just removed the www's
[14:46:41] <w00tner> im not getting the error msg anymore
[14:46:44] <w00tner> lets see...
[14:47:31] <nmeagher> Im having a problem clearing fields based on the value set, can someone help me? http://jsfiddle.net/R8kma/
[14:48:11] <madprops> will this execute when all of the images in that div load or can a single image loading trigger it? $('#post_holder').find('img').load(function()
[14:50:02] <w00tner> why do i get the errro msg when i use www's in the url and no msg without them ?
[14:54:03] <pnoexz> im having an issue with colorbox, i set the rel to 'cb' for all the links that need to open in colorbox, the problem is that its considering it to be a gallery so it shows "image 1 of 2" on top of the html fetched from the link.. this is my code: $('a[rel="cb"]').colorbox({href:siteUrl('users/flogin')}).. any ideas?
[14:55:29] <Aristata> I have a form with a few different buttons for different actions on the data. I am submitting the form via ajax. The problem is the name of the button is not getting passed into the parameter string when I serialize the form. Does anyone know a way to fix this?
[14:56:00] <pnoexz> Aristata: what is the name?
[14:56:19] <Aristata> 'mark-read', 'mark-unread', 'archive' etc
[14:56:57] <Aristata> it worked until I added ajax in, and looking at the request parameters my 'action' (button name) is no longer there/
[14:57:45] <Aristata> I tried inspecting the source element the user clicked on, but it's a list of all my inputs it seems, I don't see a way of knowing which was clicked
[15:01:33] <nmeagher> Fixed my issue with clearing fields, if anyone is interested heres the code: http://jsfiddle.net/R8kma/1/
[15:27:23] <Escherial> apologies for the silly question, but say that i want to have a "dialog" (just an abs. positioned div) appear inside of a relatively positioned anchor tag when the anchor tag is clicked, but i don't want the div itself to inherit the click() handler
[15:27:38] <Escherial> right now, clicking anywhere on the div dismisses it, since the anchor tag that it's a child of has a click handler defined
[15:27:48] <Escherial> (i guess, properly speaking, the child is part of the anchor tag)
[15:37:24] <LordVorp> Escherial: assign a "null" click handler to the popped div?
[15:38:57] <Escherial> LordVorp: ah, that's a great idea
[15:39:26] <raj> if I have a userlist for a "chatroom", and a user leaves, should I search for the text within a <p> (each user is in its own <p>), or should I give each <p> an ID of the username so I can select the element using the ID and remove it like that?
[15:39:28] <Escherial> is this a common design, by the way? having a popup div that obscures the original 'open' button with a 'close' button where the original 'open' button used to be?
[15:39:54] <Escherial> raj: ids have to be unique on the page, but using a class would work
[15:40:16] <raj> well, i can append something to the id
[15:40:19] <raj> to make sure its unique
[15:40:19] <Escherial> ah, wait, i see what you mean; yes, using an id would be much faster
[15:40:47] <Escherial> although just storing references to the <p>'s in an in-memory list would be faster still
[15:41:05] <raj> shoky, any opinion? :)
[15:41:06] <Escherial> perhaps as part of an object associated with each user
[15:44:02] <jamesarosen> Question about $.when: if any of the deferred arguments fails, it immediately resolves as failed (including firing always). Is this intended or not?
[15:45:18] <jamesarosen> looks like it's intentional: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/11162
[16:02:55] <diverdude> how can i make a flashing background effect in jquery?
[16:04:07] <jastor> diegoviola: gifanimation
[16:04:15] <jastor> fadein,fadeout,fadein,fadeout
[16:04:23] <jastor> show,hide,show,hide
[16:05:04] <jastor> css({display:"none"}) css({display:"block"})  (or what it is ;)
[16:05:49] <jastor> diverdude....
[16:05:52] <mfoxdogg|work> morning all
[16:06:16] <jastor> mfoxdogg|work: morning 01:06
[16:06:32] <mfoxdogg|work> 09:06:)
[16:07:15] <diverdude> jastor: no i said flashing background, as in a blinking colour...not disappearing
[16:07:47] <jastor> diverdude: you can do that with show and hide
[16:07:54] <jastor> diverdude: just put one above the other
[16:07:59] <jastor> and show/hide the top one
[16:14:42] <Escherial> hmm, is there an easy way to display a div, then have it dismissed when the user clicks anywhere outside of it?
[16:15:19] <imsky> yes
[16:16:00] <blindMoe> is hoverintent still widely used or has someone better come along that someone knows of?
[16:16:24] <imsky> i use threateningIntent
[16:16:59] <blindMoe> I have a menu where each item has drop downs and it uses slideDown() and slideUp() to bring them down.. it is annoying when you scroll across all of them and they all pop down then back up right away... if I .stop(true, true); them then I get a weird jump effect
[16:17:32] <blindMoe> imsky: you know I am going to have to google that just to realize it was sarcasm right? :)
[16:17:34] <imsky> just queue:false that bro
[16:17:56] <imsky> lol google away my blind friend
[16:19:25] <blindMoe> imsky: you mean .stop(false)  ?
[16:19:32] <imsky> what the hell is .stop false
[16:19:50] <imsky> lol why would you use .stop when you're complaining about jumpy effects
[16:19:58] <blindMoe> hehe because I don't know any better
[16:20:03] <imsky> just queue:false
[16:20:08] <blindMoe> its been a long hot day ;)
[16:20:18] <imsky> http://api.jquery.com/animate/
[16:20:33] <blindMoe> oh I didn't realize I could use animate options for .slideUp()
[16:22:01] <imsky> you probably could, i just do .animate as much as possible
[16:22:44] <blindMoe> yeah I don't use .slideUp and .slideDown .. normally use .animate but I figured this was the perfect time to use them
[16:23:29] <wachpwnski1> I am having an issue with a modal not returning a response after i close it and reopen it
[16:23:43] <imsky> i can help you
[16:23:46] <imsky> for a few dollars
[16:23:54] <blindMoe> haha
[16:24:16] <blindMoe> I'll glad code for you today for a cheeseburger tuesday
[16:24:19] <blindMoe> +ly
[16:25:13] <imsky> tuesdaly
[16:25:17] <imsky> a new dayly
[16:25:24] <imsky> tomorrow's fridayly
[16:25:26] <blindMoe> glad+ly ;)
[16:31:37] <xaxxon> how do I sum a selection of ranges?  $('input[type=range]').<what goes here>?
[16:31:53] <xaxxon> map could work.. but i was hoping for something more.. straightforward
[16:31:57] <imsky> map
[16:36:15] <coldhead> painted bird
[16:44:48] <wachpwnski1> why don't I get a response after closing modal. Am I not initializing again properly? https://gist.github.com/70433668a5001604047c
[16:51:12] <blindMoe> imsky: not sure if it is the best method but it is working exactly how I wanted it: $(this).children('ul').stop(true, false).animate({ height: '0px' }, 500);
[16:51:26] <imsky> why didn't you just queue:false
[16:51:33] <blindMoe> this page has some good examples of using .stop() http://css-tricks.com/examples/jQueryStop/
[16:51:36] <imsky> WHY DIDNT YOU
[16:51:42] <blindMoe> I will try queue: false and see if it gives the same result ;)
[16:51:48] <imsky> lol
[16:51:54] <imsky> naw man i'm just joking
[16:51:54] <blindMoe> hehe it probably will
[16:52:04] <imsky> i only suggested something 3 times on a lark
[16:52:07] <blindMoe> I am at the 'just make it work' stage
[16:52:22] <blindMoe> let's see if it does the same thing
[16:53:48] <blindMoe> imsky: haha queue: false does the exact same thing but it actually seems smoother
[16:53:55] * blindMoe owes you a beer... again
[16:54:07] <imsky> it's also less typing
[16:54:18] <imsky> queue:!1
[16:54:29] <imsky> stop(true, false) lolwut
[16:54:48] <imsky> STOP TRULY, YET NOT TOO TRULY
[16:55:07] <blindMoe> hehe my guess would be that .animate() uses .stop()
[16:55:07] <raj`> can I detect if there are no instances to my page open?
[16:55:47] <blindMoe> imsky: once again you offer the sexier solution
[16:56:16] <imsky> blindMoe: enjoy the sexiness my blind brother
[16:56:32] * blindMoe is rolling around in it
[16:57:33] <Escherial> sigh, having this element be a child of this click()able link just for positioning purposes is proving to be more pain than it's worth
[16:58:04] <Escherial> any ideas on how i can position it relative to the link without it being a child of link proper?
[16:58:28] <imsky> yes
[17:03:54] <razzi> can anybody recommend a caroussel plugin for mobile devices ?
[17:04:42] <imsky> like the one in logan's run?
[17:50:43] <Mr_Grim> hey

[18:26:59] <coldhead> sure!
[18:27:00] <ag4ve> maja: the same. in fact, iirc it defaults to post
[18:27:07] <coldhead> or ajax() with type: 'post'

[18:28:10] <maja> i will try again to see if this works one moment please
[18:31:00] <agrieser> I'm running into an issue where a $.ajaxStart event fires, but the $.ajaxStop event never fires. Jquery 1.8.1

[18:32:39] <agrieser> coldhead: no
[18:33:16] <agrieser> It works on every ajax call being made, except for one case. But that case is reproducible every time.
[18:33:32] <coldhead> what's special about that case?
[18:33:43] <coldhead> can you see it returning 200 OK in the debugger?
[18:33:51] <coldhead> is it json and does the JSON validate?
[18:34:18] <agrieser> Yes, it is json. I'll check that it is valid now.
[18:34:39] <Randomachiever> I have a code that works in Firefox, and chrome, but not in IE ( as usual :( ). How can I fix this to work in all browsers? http://jsfiddle.net/DAXJb/2/
[18:34:41] <maja> ok does this looks good http://jsfiddle.net/xxqRF/

[19:04:38] <harbhub> i want it to add the random number to the bottom of the list each time you click
[19:04:41] <harbhub> any tips?
[19:05:08] <coldhead> if you wrap the elemtn in a <span> or something you can append() it
[19:05:24] <harbhub> can we fiddle this?

[19:08:52] <Randomachiever> Jrockjiggz_1 there is only one button.

[19:09:15] <harbhub> coldhead: next step is to make an input text field that you type a number and it will iterate that process of generating random numbers and appending them
[19:09:32] <Randomachiever> coldhead, I know this, and I appriciate any help you can offer
[19:09:42] <Randomachiever> Ok I will look into it
[19:09:49] <Randomachiever> jrockjiggz_1 $("#fflButton").click(function () {
[19:10:01] <coldhead> http://www.jshint.com/ <3
[19:10:04] <jrockjiggz_l> the function fires fine Randomachiever
[19:10:17] <Randomachiever> jrockjiggz_1 yes in FF and Chrome, not in IE
[19:11:35] <jrockjiggz_l> Randomachiever: yup, just checked. it fires
[19:12:06] <jrockjiggz_l> maybe if you shared your issue I wouldnt spend my time proving something that isnt the problem
[19:12:14] <jrockjiggz_l> bbl
[19:14:11] <coldhead> i will never forget that jrockjiggz
[19:14:23] <coldhead> he touched my secret heart
[19:14:53] <ibodi> should we always include: $(function(){ ... }) ? i just had this <script>$('#id').click(...)</script> also works though
[19:14:53] <bot-t> (190 hours ago) <coldhead> tell ibodi http://javascriptweblog.wordpress.com/2010/07/06/function-declarations-vs-function-expressions/
[19:16:19] <coldhead> ibodi: you should NEVER include that
[19:16:27] <coldhead> you should use the full $(document).ready() form instead
[19:16:31] <coldhead> because it's more readable
[19:16:40] <coldhead> the shorthand is a hack you should never let another living soul see
[19:16:46] <harbhub> coldhead:  what did i do wrong here:  http://jsfiddle.net/G6FD5/1/
[19:16:56] <coldhead> and you should probably use it anyway because it stops you fucking things up if you move the code later
[19:17:26] <harbhub> my for loop just runs forever lol
[19:17:29] <coldhead> harbhub: you want i++ or i = i+1
[19:17:36] <coldhead> i + 1; doesn't actually change i
[19:17:36] <harbhub> i++
[19:17:40] <harbhub> oh
[19:17:42] <harbhub> so wait
[19:17:45] <harbhub> i could use
[19:17:53] <harbhub> i += i + 1
[19:17:54] <harbhub> ?
[19:17:59] <coldhead> no
[19:18:01] <harbhub> would that do that same as i++?
[19:18:03] <coldhead> that would be idiotic
[19:18:10] <coldhead> i++ is the same as i = i + 1;
[19:18:16] <harbhub> ok
[19:18:17] <coldhead> i += i + 1 is something else
[19:18:22] <harbhub> yep
[19:18:22] <coldhead> something weird and disturbing
[19:18:26] <harbhub> lmao
[19:18:41] <harbhub> cold
[19:18:45] <harbhub> coldhead:  new problem
[19:18:50] <harbhub> it just prints the same random number
[19:18:51] <harbhub> ten times
[19:19:01] <harbhub> but i want it to do a new random number each iteration
[19:19:03] <harbhub> solvable?
[19:19:11] <coldhead> you only assign the number once
[19:19:15] <coldhead> move the assingment inside the for loop
[19:19:17] <harbhub> http://jsfiddle.net/G6FD5/2/
[19:19:30] <coldhead> and make sure you understand why your way isn't working
[19:19:38] <harbhub> works
[19:19:42] <coldhead> bam
[19:19:43] <harbhub> i understand
[19:19:52] <harbhub> var n = Math.random()
[19:19:56] <harbhub> was set in stone
[19:20:03] <ibodi> coldhead: http://jsfiddle.net/Lkc2D/
[19:20:04] <harbhub> as if i tried
[19:20:08] <harbhub> var n = 5;
[19:20:13] <harbhub> it would just keep showing 5
[19:20:16] <harbhub> but once in the loop
[19:20:23] <harbhub> it calls it fresh each iteration
[19:20:31] <harbhub> i.e. new random number each time
[19:20:33] <harbhub> thanks coldhead
[19:20:35] <harbhub> you da man
[19:21:45] <coldhead> ibodi: http://jsfiddle.net/Lkc2D/1/
[19:21:55] <coldhead> good work, harbhub
[19:23:09] <harbhub> coldhead:  next i want to put an input text field so that i can type a number and it will run the for loop thatmany times
[19:23:28] <ibodi> coldhead: thanks for the tip.
[19:23:50] <coldhead> harbhub: var times = parseInt( $('#number_of_times').val() );
[19:24:00] <coldhead> you can do the HTML for that, it's beneath me
[19:24:07] <harbhub> lol ok
[19:24:11] <coldhead> also check that they enter a positive number
[19:24:14] <coldhead> or you'll be sorry
[19:24:16] <harbhub> i'll make the input that is beneath you
[19:24:24] <harbhub> ok
[19:24:28] <ibodi> however i found not few guy suggests  this: $(function(){...})
[19:24:34] <harbhub> one sec i'll patch it together then send you the fiddle
[19:24:59] <coldhead> ibodi: they do the same thing, but the more readable version is better
[19:25:03] <ibodi> coldhead: alright. only one place to write . so let's do: $(document).ready(function(){...})
[19:25:12] <coldhead> imagine someone knew to jquery looking at your code
[19:25:18] <coldhead> .ready means something
[19:25:27] <coldhead> the short hand method is unreadable
[19:25:31] <ibodi> coldhead: well. if for readable reason. i prefer shorter.
[19:25:32] <coldhead> hard to google
[19:25:38] <coldhead> fuck shorter
[19:25:47] <coldhead> buy a bigger hard disk!
[19:25:53] <ibodi> coldhead: shorter , less, always more readable. i guess.
[19:26:12] <coldhead> $() does not give any indication what is happening
[19:26:22] <coldhead> actual words liks document and ready are more readable
[19:26:37] <ibodi> coldhead: ah. i see. thanks again.
[19:26:49] <coldhead> this is basically the only thing i really feel strongly about in the whole world. if you use the short form i will kill your children
[19:27:02] <coldhead> i mean, obviously i won't really
[19:27:06] <ibodi> coldhead: can i put this in <body>:? $(document).ready(function(){...
[19:27:16] <coldhead> yes you can, ibodi
[19:27:19] <harbhub> coldhead:  got it working first try  :)   http://jsfiddle.net/G6FD5/3/
[19:27:23] <coldhead> .ready() lets you put it anywhere
[19:27:28] <ibodi> coldhead: that's great 2 to hear!
[19:28:10] <coldhead> great work, harbhub
[19:28:15] <coldhead> take five
[19:28:25] <harbhub> coldhead:  next let's add a class to each new <p> element that gives it a class 'rnd#' where #=the number it was added
[19:28:30] <coldhead> let's get drunk in this club
[19:28:45] <maja> cold head sorry question, when i have that function updateMessages() do i need to have in that div that im gonna be outputting the message from the php page ?
[19:29:16] <coldhead> maja: your code should take whatever it gets back from the PHP page and call it output
[19:29:33] <coldhead> so if you're putting straight in a div you probably don't need any HTML from the PHP page
[19:29:36] <coldhead> just text
[19:30:20] <maja> ok one moment test time
[19:31:11] <harbhub> coldhead:  i tried attaching  .addClass('rnd')  at the end of the appendTo() but it breaks the code
[19:31:25] <coldhead> http://jsfiddle.net/G6FD5/4/
[19:32:50] <coldhead> harbhub: or like this http://jsfiddle.net/G6FD5/5/
[19:33:19] <harbhub> sweet
[19:33:22] <harbhub> look what i did
[19:33:27] <harbhub> i changed 'n' to 'i'
[19:33:32] <harbhub> in the p class
[19:33:49] <harbhub> then i added css that turns the font color to red for class ._2
[19:33:51] <harbhub> and it worked
[19:34:19] <harbhub> hey
[19:34:27] <harbhub> how do we make it so that each time you click
[19:34:34] <harbhub> it erases all the existing p's
[19:34:43] <harbhub> then adds the new amount of p's that are specified
[19:34:53] <harbhub> i.e. if i click a few times it keeps stacking
[19:35:04] <harbhub> would like to erase and then append
[19:35:27] <coldhead> ?empty @ harbhub
[19:35:27] <bot-t> harbhub, .empty(): Remove all child nodes of the set of matched elements from the DOM. http://api.jquery.com/empty/
[19:35:43] <coldhead> i really admire your reluctance to even try looking this stuff up yourself, harbhub
[19:35:48] <coldhead> you'll be a good CEO some day
[19:35:53] <harbhub> sweet
[19:36:01] <harbhub> hahaha
[19:36:11] <harbhub> thanks? lol
[19:36:18] <ibodi> coldhead: which is better: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7376043/how-to-break-iframe-and-redirect-page-with-jquery
[19:36:54] <ibodi> coldhead: please be noted that url has ?para=val
[19:37:04] <harbhub> let me look and tell ya
[19:39:15] <harbhub> coldhead:  not that this is anything special to YOU but i added the color changer   http://jsfiddle.net/G6FD5/6/
[19:42:15] <coldhead> ibodi: i'd use the non-jQuery version
[19:42:26] <coldhead> you don't need to involve jQuery in this
[19:45:11] <maja> coldhead any way to test if the ajax has been requested ?
[19:46:03] <coldhead> maja: check out the network tab in firebug/web inspector
[19:46:06] <coldhead> ?ftjq
[19:46:07] <bot-t> Fixing These jQuery: A Guide to Debugging - http://fixingthesejquery.com
[19:46:17] <coldhead> brief and excellent tutorial ^
[19:46:39] <maja> what should the network tab say a
[19:46:42] <maja> ?
[19:47:05] <maja> i see its getting POST request but that does not mean to much i think
[19:48:56] <harbhub> coldhead:  what is the best way to generate a table of input number fields with M columns and N rows?
[19:49:26] <coldhead> do you need data in the columns?
[19:49:31] <coldhead> in the fields*
[19:49:32] <harbhub> so that you can fill in the input number for columns and it will make that many columns and fill out the input number for rows and it will make that many rows AND they will be input fields
[19:49:43] <harbhub> need to be able to put data in the column
[19:49:48] <harbhub> like empty fields
[19:50:07] <harbhub> but you generate the table by typing in the number of columns and the number of rows into the input boxes at first
[19:50:14] <harbhub> then it generates the table
[19:50:16] <harbhub> then you fill out the table
[19:50:29] <harbhub> then you click a button and it will start to evaluate the table numbers
[19:50:42] <harbhub> coldhead:  i want to make a monte carlo sampling program in javascript
[19:50:46] <coldhead> you could pretty much do that with the skills we have applied already today!
[19:50:48] <harbhub> step by step, though
[19:50:52] <harbhub> sweet
[19:50:53] <harbhub> :)
[19:50:56] <harbhub> i was thinking
[19:51:15] <harbhub> instead of generating <p> elements it will obviously be input elements
[19:51:21] <harbhub> that get a class attached
[19:51:27] <harbhub> in the same fashion as we did
[19:51:29] <harbhub> however
[19:51:36] <harbhub> the rows/columns is what i'm unsure about
[19:54:31] <harbhub> coldhead:  you left and came back
[19:54:42] <harbhub> i'm making a fiddle right now, will send you link when finished
[19:55:02] <coldhead> i will try to stay interested
[19:55:07] <coldhead> vaguely interested
[19:59:24] * coldhead np: tortoise - didjeridoo
[20:04:38] <harbhub> coldhead:  take a look  http://jsfiddle.net/G6FD5/7/
[20:04:53] <harbhub> so far it is spitting out the number of rows entered and the number of columns entered
[20:05:01] <harbhub> i.e. we captured that input value correctly
[20:05:16] <harbhub> do we use an html table to make this work properly?
[20:05:35] <coldhead> cool so now you need nested loops to emit the right number of columns and rows and spew them into a <table>
[20:05:43] <harbhub> yep
[20:05:54] <harbhub> haha
[20:05:56] <coldhead> this is working out great
[20:06:44] <harbhub> coldhead:  if we can make this
[20:06:59] <harbhub> we would have made the first working monte carlo sampling for project management as far as google.com knows
[20:07:07] <coldhead> you're about 4 lines of JS and one line of HTML away
[20:07:11] <harbhub> let's keep at it
[20:07:17] <harbhub> sweet
[20:07:26] <harbhub> mind you, much more logic will be applied very soon
[20:07:36] <harbhub> means, standard devs, using those random numbers
[20:07:42] <coldhead> that's what we in the judicial industry call "a matter for yourself"
[20:07:46] <harbhub> and using the input values from each cell
[20:07:53] <harbhub> lol
[20:07:57] <harbhub> you are a judge?
[20:08:46] <coldhead> no
[20:08:54] <coldhead> i was just trying to impress a girl
[20:09:16] <coldhead> but it turns out he was an undercover cop policing online paedophilia
[20:09:26] <coldhead> that became very much a matter for myself
[20:09:31] <coldhead> anyway get back to work
[20:09:35] <harbhub> lmao
[20:09:57] <harbhub> ok i'm thinking of making that div a table instead
[20:10:00] <harbhub> then
[20:10:05] <harbhub> adding row by row
[20:10:13] <coldhead> that'll do it
[20:11:08] <maja> codhead what do you think could be wrong, if i can see in the console that ajax has been requested but nothing shows ? i already spend 3 days tryng to figure this out
[20:16:09] <harbhub> this is getting kinda confusing tbh
[20:16:42] <harbhub> coldhead:  so far i figured out how to add a row to the table  http://jsfiddle.net/G6FD5/8/
[20:17:01] <harbhub> but the logic for making the row have the right number of <td>'s (columns) is eluding me
[20:17:12] <harbhub> since the column input is separate from the row input
[20:17:18] <harbhub> so a for loop would be weird
[20:17:20] <harbhub> maybe
[20:17:33] <harbhub> run a for loop to plop down the rows first
[20:17:49] <harbhub> then once completed run a for loop that adds the columns into the rows?
[20:17:52] <harbhub> or
[20:17:54] <harbhub> actually
[20:17:58] <harbhub> nvrmind this is easier i think
[20:18:00] <harbhub> one sec
[20:24:01] <starsinmypockets> Evening all - I'm trying to run a setInterval based on a radio button value... any suggestions how to do this?
[20:26:22] <harbhub> coldhead:  http://jsfiddle.net/G6FD5/9/  here is what i've got so far
[20:26:58] <citric2> Is there a way to trigger an event whenever a <select>'s value is changed? I tried .change(), but it only worked when I manually changed the selection and not after calling .val() on it
[20:28:26] <harbhub> coldhead:  i think i need to put a for loop inside the rows for loop to account for each column, thoughts?
[20:29:22] <harbhub> coldhead:  i need ya
[20:32:24] <harbhub> hmm maybe i can append to the <tr>
[20:33:22] <citric2> seems the answer is to manually call .trigger('change') after .val()
[20:33:56] <lrvick> I have an element with psuedoelemnet properties defined
[20:34:04] <lrvick> is there a way to manipulate those properties using jquery?
[20:34:38] <lrvick> $(el).find(':before').css(key,val) ?
[20:34:55] <lrvick> that does not work, but i need a way to do that, essentially
[20:34:55] <harbhub> coldhead:  let me know when you return so we can discuss, i am making progress though  :)
[20:36:37] <citric2> lrvick: pseudo-elements are not DOM elements and therefore cannot be manipulated via jQuery
[20:37:48] <citric2> lrvick: However, you can change the style being applied to a pseudo-element
[20:38:17] <lrvick> I have a spsudo element already defined in my css, and i need to change its background-image
[20:38:21] <lrvick> can jquery do this, if so how?
[20:39:04] <citric2> lrvick: You could define a class with that style change and then use .addClass
[20:39:41] <lrvick> but how can I add a class to an element that does not actually exist, and that I can not select?
[20:40:52] <citric2> lrvick: you make the class exist beforehand
[20:41:48] <lrvick> but then i would essentially just be assigning it a set of hardcoded values, yeah?
[20:41:57] <lrvick> I need to edit the values of a psudo element dynamically
[20:44:35] <citric2> lrvick: You can append new CSS styles to the body
[20:45:21] <harbhub> coldhead:  i got it working!  i used a for loop for columns inside the for loop for rows
[20:45:22] <harbhub> :)
[20:45:40] <lrvick> I need the jquery equivilant to this: document.styleSheets[0].insertRule('#myelement:before { background-image: url(\'' + my_dynamic_image_url + '\'); }', 0);
[20:45:49] <harbhub> now to make it put an input box inside the cells, which will be relatively easy
[20:45:50] <lrvick> citric2: your saying jquery simply is not capable of this?
[20:46:10] <citric2> lrvick: What part of appending new styles to the body says that?
[20:47:16] <lrvick> citric2: I have a pre-existing psudo-element I need to change the values of. I am not sure what you mean by adding a new style to the body.
[20:47:55] <citric2> lrvick: See the documentation for .append() and <style>
[20:48:05] <harbhub> coldhead:  i added the inputs and it works!
[20:48:12] <harbhub> now to add a class to each input
[20:48:23] <harbhub> that way i can grab the values of the inputs
[20:53:03] <harbhub> coldhead:  i even added the classes for each cell based on its row and column!!!
[21:05:02] <harbhub> coldhead:  now i even got it working so i can grab the input values from the created table!
[21:08:18] <coldhead> what a triumph of the human spirit
[21:12:23] <unscrewed3gs> Howdy - any pointers to how to use jquery's ajax functions to display data in a div *as it is received*?  My example is something like traceroute or ping.
[21:13:51] <coldhead> unscrewed3gs: i don't believe that's possible with vanilla jQuery
[21:14:04] <coldhead> it's more all or nothing, not progressive
[21:14:16] <coldhead> you'd have to make subsequent calls to get more data
[21:14:20] <unscrewed3gs> I'm quite new to this, but that's what I'm finding.
[21:14:53] <unscrewed3gs> And then I get pointers to very large things like comet and node.js which is just too much extra stuff.
[21:15:59] <unscrewed3gs> I did find this, but without knowing what the server side script is doing, I can't really follow it: http://mebsd.com/ipv6-ping-and-traceroute
[21:18:07] <harbhub> how do you add more than one space in between data?
[21:18:21] <harbhub> when i try  ":    "  is still shows up as only 1 space
[21:19:42] <harbhub> coldhead:  i want to make the rows has a label for each row and same for the columns, how do we do this?
[21:20:47] <harbhub> damn it will be some work i think
[21:20:52] <_zoggy_> put it in a pre
[21:20:55] <harbhub> gotta add an if statement
[21:20:58] <_zoggy_> or use &nbsp;
[21:21:03] <harbhub> huh?
[21:21:13] <harbhub> _zoggy_:  what do you mean?  fiddle me?
[21:21:18] <_zoggy_> in html whitespace is cosmetic..
[21:21:27] <harbhub> yeah i want more white space
[21:21:30] <_zoggy_> '   ' gets trimmed to ' '
[21:21:40] <harbhub> ok so how to make it show more than one?
[21:21:46] <harbhub> ' ' + ' '  ?
[21:21:49] <_zoggy_> you need to tell it not to do that.. by using a non breaking space &nbsp;
[21:29:32] <harbhub> _zoggy_: can you help me with something
[21:29:54] <harbhub> how do i add quotes without it registering as quotes
[21:30:00] <harbhub> i need quotes in quotes in quotes
[21:30:28] <harbhub> ' class="theclass" '
[21:30:33] <harbhub> that kinda works but
[21:30:43] <harbhub> i have to use this
[21:31:02] <harbhub> 'class=" ' + someVar + '"'
[21:31:12] <harbhub> help please
[21:31:38] <shoky> you can escape them with \
[21:31:48] <shoky> if you're talking about js strings
[21:31:49] <_zoggy_> use &quot; or escape it
[21:31:56] <_zoggy_> dunno what your trying to do
[21:31:58] <harbhub> escape it?
[21:32:15] <harbhub> $('<td><input class="' + 'row' + a + 'column' + b + '" name="meh" type="number" placeholder="Enter a number" /></td>').appendTo('.r' + a);
[21:32:16] <shoky> var myString = "hey this \"is quoted\" lol";
[21:32:19] <harbhub> that is what i'm trying to do
[21:32:31] <harbhub> a and b are variables
[21:32:55] <harbhub> it works (strangely) but i want to clean it up
[21:34:55] <harbhub> i used the escape
[21:35:02] <harbhub> it worked
[21:35:04] <harbhub> :)
[21:35:21] <harbhub> how do i make the quotes?
[21:35:29] <harbhub> and the single vs double quotes would be good to know
[21:36:11] <shoky> $('<td/>').append( $('<input name="meh" type="number" placeholder="..">').addClass('row'+a+'column'+b) ).appendTo('.r'+a);
[21:36:36] <tw2113> hoky shoky
[21:36:53] <shoky> nothing rhymes with tw2113
[21:37:01] <shoky> i cant even say it
[21:38:05] <tw2113> t w 21 13 is how most people do it
[21:38:24] <coldhead> "twer num"
[21:38:26] <coldhead> that's what i call it
[21:38:31] <shoky> i just mentally say 'tw' as in 'twerp' and then i lose it
[21:38:44] <tw2113> tdubs works
[21:38:49] <coldhead> tdubs is great
[21:38:53] <coldhead> sup tdubs
[21:39:33] <tw2113> now you can say tdubby have a chubby
[21:39:42] <harbhub> shoky:  thanks i like your method better than what i was trying
[21:40:03] <coldhead> shoky is good like that, harbhub
[21:40:09] <coldhead> you should do whatever he says
[21:40:18] <coldhead> professionally or personally
[21:40:19] <harbhub> heh
[21:40:22] <harbhub> lmao
[21:40:48] <shoky> give coldhead a massage
[21:41:32] <shoky> i'll just call you brainzzz, tw
[21:41:42] * coldhead covers himself in vegetable oil
[21:41:53] <shoky> $_$
[21:44:23] <harbhub> anyone use jade template engine before?
[21:44:47] <shoky> naw man
[21:52:41] <wingy> is there a way to get all form fields?
[21:52:51] <harbhub> guys i need you once more
[21:53:01] <harbhub> so my fiddle needs to add labels for each row and column
[21:53:17] <harbhub> like Row 1 for the first row on the left side inline
[21:53:29] <harbhub> and Column 1 for the first column on the top
[21:53:36] <harbhub> etc for all rows/columns
[21:53:39] <harbhub> any tips?
[21:53:49] <harbhub> actually
[21:53:55] <harbhub> just a text field
[21:54:00] <coldhead> so add the row number every time you add a tr
[21:54:04] <harbhub> so like Row 1 + text field
[21:54:08] <coldhead> and add a row of column numbers at the very top
[21:54:21] <harbhub> how?
[21:54:25] <harbhub> i know that is what i want to do
[21:54:29] <harbhub> but not sure how to do it
[21:54:36] <harbhub> let me give you the fiddle
[21:55:05] <harbhub> http://jsfiddle.net/harbhub/4UyEg/
[21:55:17] <harbhub> shoky and coldhead  check out the project thus far
[21:55:20] <harbhub> it is pretty sweet
[21:55:35] <harbhub> lets add Row 1 [text input]
[21:55:47] <coldhead> the way you say "lets" is highly motivating
[21:55:58] <coldhead> i am considering quiting my job to join you full time on this project, harbhub
[21:56:14] <coldhead> i never even wanted to be a judge
[21:56:25] <coldhead> i wanted to be a princess
[21:56:28] <harbhub> coldhead:  lol sarcasm? or seriousness!?
[21:56:29] <coldhead> under the sea
[21:56:30] <harbhub> haha
[21:56:42] <coldhead> with a cloak of beautiful ermine
[21:56:47] <coldhead> and i don't even know what ermine is
[21:56:52] <harbhub> lmao
[21:56:55] <coldhead> but i bet i'd look great in it
[21:57:12] <harbhub> its an animal fur
[21:57:16] <harbhub> just looked it up
[21:57:23] <coldhead> thanks babe
[21:57:51] <harbhub> check out the code lol it will challenge you hopefully (or be really easy to add the labels idk)
[21:59:19] <harbhub> i'm thinking about adding the var rows and var columns outside the functions
[21:59:25] <harbhub> that way they can be shared
[21:59:28] <harbhub> once input
[22:00:07] <harbhub> ok i made them global to the script
[22:00:45] <harbhub> lol i think i either stumped coldhead and shoky or they aren't looking at our code
[22:01:30] <coldhead> http://jsfiddle.net/4UyEg/2/
[22:01:36] <coldhead> that's rows
[22:01:41] <coldhead> over to you for columns
[22:01:42] <coldhead> ?cc
[22:01:42] <bot-t> CASE CLOASED >: |
[22:02:18] <harbhub> coldhead:  you beast
[22:03:41] <harbhub> coldhead:  i cant find what you did lmao
[22:04:07] <coldhead> just an extra td at the top of the for loop
[22:05:10] <harbhub> ohhh
[22:05:12] <harbhub> i see now
[22:05:14] <harbhub> yep
[22:05:22] <harbhub> you beast
[22:15:58] <harbhub> coldhead:  yep can't figure out how to add column names
[22:16:31] <coldhead> <tr><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>3</td>...</tr>
[22:16:37] <coldhead> write some JS to produce that
[22:17:27] <harbhub> yea but
[22:17:30] <harbhub> needs to go on the top
[22:18:05] <harbhub> do you mean to put that
[22:18:08] <harbhub> as another for loop
[22:18:13] <harbhub> inside the original for loop
[22:18:18] <harbhub> but before the columns for loop?
[22:18:21] <coldhead> yes
[22:18:27] <coldhead> think about what you're doing, babe
[22:18:32] <coldhead> you're building a row at a time
[22:18:37] <coldhead> so before you start adding rows
[22:18:39] <coldhead> add this row
[22:18:46] <coldhead> then everything else is business as usual
[22:18:52] <coldhead> the other rows don't enter into it
[22:19:01] <harbhub> hmm
[22:20:17] <harbhub> yeh still no clue haha
[22:20:52] <coldhead> if i were to do it for you it would belittle us both
[22:21:29] <harbhub> i know
[22:21:32] <harbhub> i don't want ya to do it
[22:21:41] <harbhub> i'm just lettin ya know where my mind is at ahaha
[22:23:31] <coldhead> http://jsfiddle.net/4UyEg/3/
[22:23:43] <coldhead> i feel so little
[22:27:00] <harbhub> i havent opened it yet
[22:27:02] <harbhub> i'm still trying
[22:27:03] <harbhub> lol
[22:29:24] <aga> Hello,
[22:29:35] <aga> anyone can help me with the dialog()
[22:29:48] <wingy> didn't know that jquery mobile was just a few months old
[22:29:59] <wingy> for the stable version
[22:29:59] <harbhub> i'm about to give up lol
[22:30:19] <Lucky--> wingy: lol, no way
[22:30:27] <Lucky--> wingy: but yea it does have its problems.
[22:31:43] <harbhub> coldhead:  don't feel little but i'm gonna peek i think
[22:31:50] <wingy> Lucky--: i mean the first stable version was released some months ago
[22:31:58] <coldhead> do what you gotta do
[22:32:01] <coldhead> the deed is done
[22:32:02] <wingy> already a lot of books about it
[22:32:05] <wingy> pretty amazing
[22:32:09] <coldhead> comes with a free bug to fix anyway
[22:32:11] <wingy> great framework to be honest
[22:32:19] <aga> Do I have to load jQuery first and then UI or vice versa?
[22:32:41] <coldhead> jQ first
[22:32:45] <coldhead> always first
[22:32:53] <coldhead> like a woman's love
[22:34:39] <harbhub> nice i see it bugs the last value
[22:34:44] <harbhub> let me work on fixing that
[22:34:47] <harbhub> and increasing my understanding
[22:35:18] <aga> Well, I do have it like that, then I create a div with id="dialog" and call $("#dialog").dialog() and nothing happens
[22:35:20] <harbhub> so you basically started the table with an appendTo('#table3') that puts the <tr>
[22:35:48] <harbhub> bug fixed
[22:35:59] <harbhub> just did +1 to columns in the coldhead loop
[22:36:11] <harbhub> since your origin was 1 instead of 0
[22:36:15] <harbhub> easy fix son!
[22:36:16] <coldhead> you beast
[22:36:23] <harbhub> haha no you are
[22:36:46] <coldhead> aga: so that's some kind of bug
[22:36:54] <coldhead> do you see any error in the console?
[22:37:02] <harbhub> coldhead:  what do you do for a living though, i couldn't tell if you are a judge or developer or what lol
[22:37:03] <coldhead> like maybe dialog isn't definted?
[22:37:04] <aga> oh no, it does create the dialog but without styles
[22:37:19] <coldhead> you need jQuery UI css too
[22:37:21] <harbhub> since your run in with the police online heh
[22:37:24] <coldhead> as i hope you can understand
[22:37:25] <aga> the content for the dialog was in the middle of html content's text and I didn't see that
[22:37:49] <coldhead> harbhub: i'm not entirely sure, but i know it's nothing important
[22:38:16] <harbhub> coldhead:  cool so how do you eat if you don't do anything?
[22:38:30] <coldhead> i get paid to do something
[22:38:37] <coldhead> just not sure of the bigger picture
[22:38:49] <coldhead> today it's something to do with an infographic for london fashion week
[22:40:47] <harbhub> infographic?
[22:40:53] <harbhub> time to google..
[22:41:03] <coldhead> it's really not worth talking about
[22:42:25] <harbhub> if you say so
[22:42:31] <harbhub> it looks interesting though
[22:42:57] <harbhub> i would ask you what software you use to make your infographs, but i won't
[22:44:36] <harbhub> coldhead:  i played with a table and now i see what you did
[22:44:53] <harbhub> when you put a bunch of unnested td's in a table element
[22:45:03] <harbhub> it returns them in a single row
[22:45:06] <harbhub> each as a column
[22:45:10] <harbhub> so first you did that
[22:45:20] <harbhub> and filled the first value with 'i love you, coldhead'
[22:45:32] <harbhub> since you knew that the first rows were labels
[22:45:42] <harbhub> you are a boss
[22:46:18] <coldhead> great result
[22:46:20] <coldhead> let's take five
[22:46:49] <harbhub> lol i don't stop (can't stop won't stop)
[22:48:33] <harbhub> i just did the same for rows
[22:48:45] <harbhub> turns out you need to nest a td element in a row to make it do anything
[22:50:27] <harbhub> bettering my understanding of tables and jquery, one coldhead tutorial at a time
[22:56:19] <harbhub> forgot how to join other chats
[23:11:40] <harbhub> coldhead:  your skillz are needed again
[23:12:10] <harbhub> nvrmind
[23:12:12] <harbhub> figured it out
[23:16:23] <harbhub> coldhead:  ok i'm trying to take the value for each cell and display it
[23:16:37] <harbhub> cant seem to make a working way to do it
[23:17:02] <harbhub> so far if i specifiy a certain rowXcolumnY it works, but where i try to make a var that holds the name it doesnt work
[23:17:08] <harbhub> i can show you the code
[23:18:58] <harbhub> guys
[23:19:02] <coldhead> you better
[23:19:07] <coldhead> it works fine in my imagination
[23:19:10] <harbhub> how do you put a variable in as a selector?
[23:19:11] <harbhub> lol
[23:19:22] <coldhead> $('.' + someVar)
[23:19:31] <coldhead> probably
[23:20:04] <harbhub> http://jsfiddle.net/harbhub/4UyEg/4/
[23:20:11] <harbhub> oh let me try your suggestion
[23:21:04] <harbhub> grr
[23:21:08] <harbhub> coldhead:  that worked!
[23:21:20] <harbhub> for some reason the . needed to not be in the var
[23:21:24] <harbhub> like you proposed
[23:21:27] <harbhub> although, why?
[23:21:50] <coldhead> i don't know, man, i'm just some guy
[23:22:51] <erdos> hey does anyone know if jquery automatically handles browser prefixes? like will $("blah").css("border-radius", "40px"); will that set -webkit-border-radius, -moz-border-radius etc.?
[23:23:15] <amccloud> Is it possible to delegate the window resize event?
[23:24:08] <coldhead> it will not, erdos
[23:24:25] <erdos> coldhead: thanks
[23:24:45] <coldhead> amccloud: it should be
[23:24:51] <erdos> coldhead++
[23:25:02] <harbhub> got it working
[23:25:08] <amccloud> coldhead: am I doing something wrong here? http://jsfiddle.net/ZKcYh/
[23:25:18] <harbhub> coldhead++ += coldhead++
[23:25:22] <harbhub> o.0
[23:26:26] <erdos> does the bot here do karma?
[23:26:34] <coldhead> invalid left hand assignment
[23:26:36] <erdos> i've just been karma-ing everyone
[23:26:45] <erdos> bot ?karma erdos
[23:26:53] <erdos> bot?
[23:27:02] <coldhead> i don't think any of the bots are actively checking erdos but jesus knows
[23:27:17] <erdos> lol
[23:27:24] <harbhub> coldhead:  check out the fiddle now, i updated it to be the bomb
[23:27:28] <wingy> is there a way to get all form element values for a form?
[23:27:31] <harbhub> http://jsfiddle.net/harbhub/4UyEg/5/
[23:27:43] <harbhub> now it also grabs all the values and spits them out appropriately
[23:27:53] <harbhub> we made something that lets you build a custom table
[23:27:58] <harbhub> input values into that table
[23:28:03] <harbhub> and do stuff with the table inputs
[23:28:09] <harbhub> oh dear... too much power
[23:34:02] <harbhub> how do you protect your code so that when it is hosted online it cannot be viewed?
[23:34:26] <harbhub> don't really want people seeing the monte carlo sampling code once finished, unless they send me an email asking me for it
[23:34:34] <shoky> wingy: maybe you want .serialize()
[23:34:47] <coldhead> that's not something we'll help you with, harbhub
[23:34:51] <coldhead> open web and all that
[23:34:54] <coldhead> share and enjoy
[23:34:59] <harbhub> hmm
[23:35:03] <harbhub> fair enough
[23:35:11] <harbhub> i dont want people changing it though
[23:35:22] <harbhub> for instance, i hear about script attacks
[23:35:37] <harbhub> i dont want someone to be able to go to the website and then change it all
[23:35:47] <coldhead> so choose a good secure password
[23:35:55] <coldhead> use non-standard ports
[23:35:57] <coldhead> etc
[23:36:03] <harbhub> okay
[23:36:07] <harbhub> good points
[23:36:19] <harbhub> also, i will only put a minified 'uglified' version on the site
[23:36:22] <harbhub> to add more protection
[23:36:33] <harbhub> no one will want to attack it since it wont make any sense
[23:36:36] <wingy> shoky: wow .. that was a cool one
[23:38:41] <wingy> shoky: serializeArray() was cooler though .. better for iteration
[23:39:39] <wingy> i wonder why they don't add https://github.com/hongymagic/jQuery.serializeObject
[23:39:47] <wingy> object is a much better representation
[23:43:34] <aga> if I have <div id=""><p id="content"></p></div> then how do I set data to p.content if I have $("#notification")
[23:43:45] <aga> sorry <div id="notification">
[23:52:24] <coldhead> can you rephrase the question, aga?
[23:54:45] <harbhub> coldhead:  how do i parse text from a text input?
[23:54:54] <harbhub> nvrmind
[23:54:56] <aga> Already figured it out coldhead :) by using the find()
[23:55:16] <coldhead> great job everyone, take five
[23:55:50] <harbhub> i figured mine out by using .val()
[23:55:52] <harbhub> :)
[23:55:58] <harbhub> coldhead:  you should be a professor
[23:56:24] <coldhead> STOP TRYING TO CHANGE ME
[23:56:30] <retrostyle|13> hey duddes
[23:56:32] <coldhead> sorry, wrong window
[23:56:41] <coldhead> what the hell do you want, retrostyle|13
[23:56:46] <coldhead> this better be good
[23:56:52] <coldhead> or i will kill you all
[23:57:00] <retrostyle|13> :)
