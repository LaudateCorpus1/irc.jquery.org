[00:00:52] <arc_> doesn't it seem like something like that should already exist
[00:58:01] <z1haze> i have this form i submit with ajax: http://dpaste.com/0SM15D1 and on the validation errors when they are returned, the array is only a single element array, and the errors populate in the div, but for some reason there is ALWAYS an 'undefined' as the first error
[00:58:40] <z1haze> it returns this http://puu.sh/lXmRY/027cd287f4.png but where is the undefined coming from?
[01:15:26] <Cork> z1haze: hard to say without seeing the json you get back
[01:15:49] <Cork> z1haze: ah, wait
[01:15:56] <Cork> html += <--
[01:16:18] <Cork> var html; html += "somethting" == html = undefined + "something"
[01:16:33] <z1haze> whoa what
[01:16:36] <Cork> z1haze: so change var html; to var html='';
[01:16:41] <z1haze> oh ok
[01:17:57] <z1haze> thanks guys
[01:18:12] <z1haze> is it normal to get a console error though, a 422 back from this request?
[01:18:25] <z1haze> if theres an error anyway
[01:18:42] <Cork> z1haze: the console normally logs != 2xx responses ya
[01:19:01] <Cork> how depends a bit on the browser though
[01:19:05] <z1haze> alright

[03:25:29] <JJ> Hi all
[03:34:02] <hellyeah> i wrote something like that and i used template but not sure how can i search advantages and disadvantages of using template. Can you give me some idea about that?

[04:01:18] <Prabhat> hi
[04:01:22] <Prabhat> https://jsfiddle.net/jwaz6qhL/1/
[04:01:48] <Prabhat> please check i want total and grand total for more than one record
[04:01:57] <Prabhat> please help
[04:03:29] <arc_> then assign a class to units and unitprice fields and select them by that class, then do foreach to get the total
[04:05:28] <arc_> btw, rows that you add dynamically can't have the same id as the rows that previously existed
[04:05:30] <arc_> that is not valid html
[04:05:46] <arc_> any id must be unique
[04:06:03] <Prabhat> Can you give mie a short example ?
[04:06:15] <Prabhat> mie=me
[04:06:24] <arc_> so you can either not have an id on any element that you are dynamically adding, or you can generate an id by adding a number on the end of it or something
[04:06:36] <arc_> depending on your requirements
[04:07:43] <Prabhat> I have generated number but are added as 1,,....5,4,3,2 order
[04:08:17] <arc_> your + glyph is not appearing for me, presumably because you haven't loaded a webfont in this fiddle
[04:08:27] <Twirl> hey guys, how can i get the text of the <select> <option selected>TEXT</option> </select> instead of the .val() ?
[04:08:38] <arc_> .html()
[04:08:44] <Twirl> arc_: nope
[04:08:53] <Prabhat> arc_ sir give me short example
[04:08:54] <arc_> really?
[04:08:58] <Twirl> that is getting all the <options>
[04:09:04] <Twirl> yea i already tried that
[04:09:10] <arc_> do you have a fiddle?
[04:09:15] <Twirl> lol?
[04:09:20] <arc_> jsfiddle
[04:09:31] <arc_> i guess not
[04:09:31] <Twirl> what fiddle its just an element and a 3 word command
[04:09:42] <Twirl> i just typed your fiddle up there
[04:09:43] <arc_> yeah i understand it's simple
[04:09:50] <Twirl>  <select> <option selected>TEXT</option> </select>
[04:10:52] <arc_> it works here. how are you selecting it
[04:11:37] <Twirl> dude i just told you it gives the whole content of the <select> element as HTML raw
[04:12:01] <Twirl> that is a hundred <option value="blabla">blabla</option>
[04:12:48] <arc_> you aren't being very patient for someone who is asking for help. your intentions may not be as clear as you think they are
[04:13:02] <arc_> you gave the html, but not the jquery
[04:13:43] <arc_> do you want the full list of select options in text, or do you want one select option in text
[04:14:24] <arc_> from your example, it really seemed like you only wanted one select option in text, since you only wrote one
[04:14:27] <Twirl> <select id="element"> OPTIONS </select> $('#element').html() // gets all what's inside of the select element as raw html
[04:14:36] <arc_> correct
[04:14:44] <Twirl> no
[04:14:57] <Twirl> I said "how can i get the text of the <select> <option selected>TEXT</option> </select> instead of the .val() ?"
[04:15:08] <Twirl> it's in caps for extra clarity
[04:15:19] <arc_> select the option, not the select
[04:15:34] <Twirl> options don't have selectors
[04:15:37] <Twirl> it's just selected
[04:16:21] <Twirl> actually it's not even selected
[04:16:35] <arc_> yes, so we need more detail. how are you trying to select it
[04:16:40] <arc_> is it a specific number?
[04:16:46] <arc_> is it just the one that's selected?
[04:16:46] <Twirl> it shows selected in the browser but it's not showing any difference in the html
[04:16:57] <Twirl> its just the one selected
[04:17:09] <Twirl> it's pretty simple what details?
[04:17:27] <Twirl> couldn't be more simple
[04:17:44] <Prabhat> Please help
[04:18:12] <Twirl> i could add an event to mark it somehow on click/change but it's stupid because it's showing right there in the browser
[04:20:26] <arc_> https://jsfiddle.net/tq7r8fm4/ this works
[04:21:37] <arc_> in the future try to be more cooperative. nobody is going to ask you questions just for fun. if i just interpret your request a certain way and it ends up being wrong, i could do needless work and end up spending more time than necessary just because you felt like you didn't want to answer questions
[04:22:15] <Twirl> $("#select option[value='" + $('#select').val() + "]'").text(); might work
[04:22:39] <Twirl> no your example is worthless
[04:22:49] <Twirl> sorry bud, in the future try answering when you know something
[04:23:07] <arc_> i guess the streak of not encountering any jackasses in here couldn't last forever
[04:23:13] <arc_> peace
[04:23:13] <Twirl> and stop saying things like "nobody is going to" because its just you talking
[04:23:24] <Twirl> speak for yourself
[04:23:56] <Twirl> so many people trying to look bigger speaking about themselves in plural lol wtf u have multiple personlities or something
[04:24:11] <Twirl> a group of ppl inside ur head
[04:29:25] <Prabhat> https://jsfiddle.net/jwaz6qhL/11/
[04:30:01] <Prabhat> please check the fiddle...I want total and grand total on change event but not working
[04:30:37] <Prabhat> any solution?
[04:32:09] <arc_> like i said. you can't have multiple elements that have the same id in the same document. ids must be unique. if you want to select multiple elements with one selector, you need to use a class
[04:32:38] <arc_> if you try to do this, it's only going to return the first element of the id you selected
[04:32:48] <Prabhat> Please tell me how..i am new
[04:39:17] <Prabhat> I am using bootstrap then tell me how can i use class attribute for it
[04:40:59] <Prabhat> arc_: are u there sir?
[04:45:42] <suexec> I'm brain farting. If I pass "#element_id" to a function, can I do ie: function emptyTarget(target) { $(target).empty(); } and then run emptyTarget("#element_id");
[04:49:24] <Prabhat> Are  jquery class attribute and bootstrap class attribute same?
[04:49:27] <suexec> nvm - fixed it
[04:49:31] <suexec> Was a total brainfart

[07:00:33] <tb_b_> hi could anyone help me out -> https://jsfiddle.net/pts7xbon/
[07:01:20] <Audlex> to do what
[07:01:41] <tb_b_> i need to count only that td's with specific target, which child td's does not contains a specific text
[07:02:11] <tb_b_> in my example it should only alert 1 time
[07:08:01] <Audlex> so you only want to count it if it has "count me" in it?
[07:13:20] <tb_b_> not exactly, that was for example. i want only count that target User hrefs if the third <td> underneath hasn't an specific text in my case "me you should count"  I've updated the example
[07:37:38] <tb_b_> Audlex: any Idea, how i could achieve that
[07:55:58] <tb_b_> or anyone else i need something like has and has not
[07:56:54] <Tennis> you can write some nested ifs maybe
[07:57:10] <Tennis> with a detailed selector
[07:57:20] <Tennis> I'm thinking for each td child child
[07:57:41] <Tennis> if this.text() != "whatever" do this

[08:21:44] <hellyeah> hey there is five divs here i need to show them seperately what can i do here https://jsfiddle.net/k9m0zf36/20/
[08:25:27] <tyurd> line 30: try template.clone().appendTo('body') and fix may fix your css due it overlays your 5 boxes
[08:28:53] <hellyeah> tyurd: https://jsfiddle.net/k9m0zf36/21/
[08:29:20] <tyurd> yea like this. now there is just a css fail, i guess
[08:29:52] <hellyeah> any idea what that would be?
[08:30:10] <tyurd> .buttoncounters need a height (and width)
[08:30:31] <tyurd> yea, thats it
[08:31:17] <tyurd> https://jsfiddle.net/w8e04uct/
[08:31:20] <tyurd> btw that should be enough, too
[08:31:26] <tyurd> (since line 28)
[08:31:59] <hellyeah> 28 in css?
[08:32:19] <hellyeah> js
[08:32:21] <hellyeah> hmm
[08:32:30] <tyurd> js 28, css 57
[08:32:31] <hellyeah> what do you think about my way?
[08:32:47] <tyurd> of css or js?
[08:32:47] <hellyeah> defining template
[08:32:57] <hellyeah> no i mean whole idea
[08:33:00] <hellyeah> defining template
[08:33:08] <tyurd> i would build the template by jquery only
[08:33:09] <hellyeah> and create element by using that template
[08:33:26] <hellyeah> like defining all elements
[08:33:31] <hellyeah> and append it to each other
[08:33:34] <Pazician> Nä fyfan vad läskigt! https://www.facebook.com/humorcabron/videos/1078645805484713/
[08:33:42] <Pazician> Ops
[08:33:53] <Pazician> Sorry about that
[08:33:57] <tyurd> np.
[08:33:59] <taplar> hellyeah: your re-wrapping your template variable
[08:34:23] <tyurd> taplar: are you a jQuery pro or similar?
[08:34:29] <hellyeah> taplar: i need to create same element over and over again
[08:34:34] <tyurd> (just asking becuz i have a weird problem, too)
[08:34:37] <taplar> 'pro'?  *shrug*
[08:34:41] <taplar> i tinker, :)
[08:34:49] <hellyeah> he is just a dude
[08:34:55] <taplar> yup
[08:35:04] <tyurd> like all of us *yay*
[08:35:09] <hellyeah> yeah
[08:35:10] <tyurd> taplar: could we write private?
[08:35:32] <taplar> it's preferred to throw the convos in here.  so others can also comment, and read and learn
[08:36:06] <hellyeah> taplar: every buttonsandcounter has its own space
[08:36:19] <hellyeah> there is five buttonsandcounters
[08:36:34] <tyurd> Uhm wait, i'll fiddle that
[08:37:04] <taplar> hellyeah: you talking about /21 ?
[08:37:20] <hellyeah> let me double check
[08:37:43] <hellyeah> taplar: i am talking about this https://jsfiddle.net/w8e04uct/1/
[08:38:56] <deadevilboy> hello guys
[08:39:02] <deadevilboy> I have a problem/question
[08:39:15] <deadevilboy> I am building a website with a database
[08:39:39] <deadevilboy> I have main window and then I was using php require_once to navigate on different parts of the site
[08:39:52] <deadevilboy> those parts/content were forms
[08:40:04] <tyurd> yea
[08:40:26] <deadevilboy> then I was using jquery to submit them withou refreshin the webpage
[08:40:32] <deadevilboy> everything was working ok
[08:40:46] <deadevilboy> but now, I decide to change php require
[08:40:55] <deadevilboy> and I start using jquery to load the content
[08:41:12] <deadevilboy> and now the submit without refreshing is not working
[08:41:17] <deadevilboy> why so?
[08:41:25] <tb_b_> https://jsfiddle.net/pts7xbon/4/ i have updated the code with a .not selector, but it still not work, may someone could take a look at it
[08:43:16] <tyurd> tb_b_, your inline code is pretty.. why?
[08:43:19] <deadevilboy> because I didn't touch js file with the submit catch
[08:44:11] <taplar> and i'm back!
[08:44:23] <taplar> silly pair guy decided to unhook our switch, ~_~
[08:44:50] <tyurd> taplar: found my mistake. but thank you anyways. but its hard to explain xd
[08:44:57] <taplar> np
[08:45:38] <deadevilboy> any idea guys?
[08:45:50] <taplar> what's the q?
[08:46:33] <deadevilboy> I mean, the question is, why isn't the submit with jquery ajax working... because it shouldn't refresh the webpage
[08:46:52] <deadevilboy> and it only happen when I change php require for jquery load
[08:47:25] <deadevilboy> (I am supposing, because before that change, everything was working ok)
[08:50:39] <deadevilboy> the code is something like this: https://jsfiddle.net/j2v2papn/
[08:52:19] <taplar> what's the issue?
[08:52:30] <Cork> deadevilboy: split out the code that loads the js
[08:52:39] <taplar> btw fwiw ln 10-15 could be done with serialize()
[08:52:40] <Cork> so you don't include the js references in the response
[08:53:49] <deadevilboy> yeah.. I was reading yesterday and I saw that "serialize()" would fit best
[08:53:51] <taplar> does returning false from ready do anything?
[08:54:49] <deadevilboy> taplar: forget that returning false... I alreday exclude it.. I was just testing because the problem is that return false should prevent submit from doing the normal way
[08:54:58] <deadevilboy> but it is not working
[08:55:01] <deadevilboy> don't know why
[08:55:12] <deadevilboy> when I submit
[08:55:37] <deadevilboy> the page refreshes to php file that connects to the DB
[08:56:13] <taplar> have you tried passing in the event and doing event.preventDefault()
[08:56:53] <taplar> false should do it, i just wonder if maybe it's not happening fast enough
[08:57:15] <deadevilboy> doin this here: function gravando() { 					$("#npav_content_text2").find("#FORM_a").submit(e); 	e.defaultPrevent			};
[08:57:16] <deadevilboy> ?
[08:57:56] <taplar> $(selector).on(eventString, function(event){ event.preventDefault(); });
[08:58:58] <deadevilboy> If I use e.preventDefault there... the code only displays "saving" in the webpage.. then nothing happens.. I mean.. from what I've seen, I guess the js file with the submit catch is not recognizing that submit..
[08:59:03] <deadevilboy> dunno why
[08:59:29] <taplar> so there's your first thing to track down
[08:59:37] <taplar> make sure the selectors are matching the same form
[09:00:06] <deadevilboy> the selector is class="ajax"
[09:00:13] <deadevilboy> so it should be .ajax right?
[09:00:27] <taplar> yep
[09:00:44] <deadevilboy> or is the interpreter making confusion with $.ajax?
[09:00:54] <taplar> no
[09:01:43] <deadevilboy> grrr... what a stupid problem
[09:01:44] <deadevilboy> hahaha
[09:02:09] <taplar> just so i'm clear, are you saying line 7 in the html block (btw, all that should really be in the js block) should be caught by the submit catch in the js block?
[09:03:54] <deadevilboy> hmm
[09:04:25] <deadevilboy> yeah
[09:04:43] <deadevilboy> that line should trigger submit in the form
[09:04:47] <taplar> of which, they're using two different selectors
[09:04:57] <deadevilboy> then I have a js script file with the one catching that event and returnt it to false
[09:05:01] <deadevilboy> but not working
[09:05:09] <taplar> and also --> $("#npav_content_text2").find("#FORM_a") should just be $("#FORM_a")
[09:05:18] <deadevilboy> one based on ID and another on Class
[09:05:22] <deadevilboy> but it is the same form
[09:05:28] <taplar> u sure?
[09:05:44] <deadevilboy> yes.. I will show u the form
[09:06:08] <deadevilboy> <div id="npav_content_text2">     	<form id="FORM_a" action="npav/npav_gravar.php" method="POST" class="ajax">
[09:06:26] <taplar> ok
[09:07:03] <deadevilboy> that line 7 has a purpose.. I simplify for example purposes but it will check if it is ID FORM_a, FORM_b etc...
[09:07:14] <deadevilboy> so it will submit different forms on the same webpage
[09:07:25] <taplar> your only looking for form_a
[09:07:30] <deadevilboy> but I just change to "FORM_a" just to test
[09:07:55] <deadevilboy> yeah.. I know... I hide the other part of the code for testing
[09:08:12] <deadevilboy> just to simplify and try to find the problem
[09:08:19] <taplar> ok, but regardless.  if your going to lookup by id, you should just do it in $(), not find()
[09:08:22] <Bheam> yo
[09:08:35] <Bheam> so i'm having some trouble. i'm adding fb post embed code dynamically
[09:08:49] <Bheam> 1) if i add it, then remove it, then add it again, the js isn't executed
[09:09:16] <Bheam> 2) i can't figure out any event i can use to check if the js is executed and the iframe loaded so i can resize the container
[09:09:41] <hellyeah> he
[09:09:41] <hellyeah> y
[09:10:02] <hellyeah> i am creating div dynamically i want to put an empty div between elements how can i do that https://jsfiddle.net/w8e04uct/3/
[09:10:32] <deadevilboy> I was using find because It was searchin form different forms.. but I will kill that for now and see if that is the problem
[09:11:32] <deadevilboy> it is not the problem.. and it shouldn't be
[09:11:49] <deadevilboy> because he is "finding" the form.. otherwise it wouldn't be submited
[09:12:07] <deadevilboy> the only problem is that it is no being intercepted and prevent the default action
[09:12:58] <deadevilboy> *not
[09:13:31] <hellyeah> my question is understandable?
[09:14:02] <taplar> not saying it is the problem, only that it's not recommended
[09:14:45] <hellyeah> taplar: ?
[09:15:04] <taplar> that was for deadboy
[09:15:09] <hellyeah> sorry
[09:15:49] <deadevilboy> hmmm.. maybe I will try to make simple code now just to test.. simulate the jquery loads... and the try it without so many stuff
[09:16:17] <taplar> hellyeah: so your wanting a div between the templates?  only between?
[09:16:31] <tyurd> deadevilboy: btw you might use $.post/$.get instead of $.ajax. doing the same but prettier
[09:16:40] <hellyeah> actually let me try to explain my problem
[09:17:08] <Cork> tyurd: there is quite little gain from that now days actually
[09:17:15] <tyurd> Cork: explain pls
[09:17:31] <Cork> it is the difference between $.post(url) and $.ajax(url, { type: "post" })
[09:17:37] <hellyeah> https://jsfiddle.net/w8e04uct/3/ check this https://jsfiddle.net/w8e04uct/4/ check this i just changed line 57 what i try to do is to avoid that conflicts?
[09:17:42] <tyurd> Cork: so its shorter?
[09:17:43] <Cork> and $.get(url) and $.ajax(url)
[09:17:55] <Cork> tyurd: not to a level where it matters
[09:18:03] <deadevilboy> yeah
[09:18:08] <tyurd> Cork: okay.
[09:18:18] <Cork> tyurd: and as soon as you need to provide an option $.post and $.get becomes unusable
[09:18:23] <hellyeah> taplar: i guess giving height is not the solution
[09:18:37] <deadevilboy> I don't want to make my code better for now.. I want it to work.. and that is my problem :D hehehe
[09:18:50] <tyurd> Cork: sure. but for simple requests it is really useful (like sending a form)
[09:18:57] <taplar> hellyeah: i don't see a difference between /3 and /4.  and your still re-wrapping your template
[09:19:18] <Cork> tyurd: except if you need to provide encoding type for example
[09:19:21] <hellyeah> what do you mean with re wraping?
[09:19:27] <Cork> or dataType
[09:19:32] <taplar> var template = $(something)
[09:19:35] <taplar> $(template)
[09:19:39] <taplar> ^ re-wrapping
[09:19:40] <tyurd> Cork: should we continue or stop this communication? xd
[09:19:44] <taplar> it's already a jQuery object
[09:19:47] <Cork> :)
[09:20:30] <Cork> taplar: uh
[09:20:34] <hellyeah> taplar: you mean that line  var template = $.parseHTML($('#myTemplate').html());
[09:20:38] <Cork> taplar: that isn't correct actually
[09:20:50] <Cork> $parseHTML returns a raw dom fragment
[09:20:56] <Cork> not a jquery object
[09:20:56] <taplar> well crap
[09:21:02] <hellyeah> :XD
[09:21:12] <Cork> $($.parseHTML($('#myTemplate').html())) gives you a jquery object
[09:21:20] <taplar> wrap it once and reuse it!
[09:21:23] * taplar hides in a corner
[09:21:32] <hellyeah> :X:D
[09:21:37] <deadevilboy> lol
[09:22:12] <hellyeah> Cork: taplar https://jsfiddle.net/w8e04uct/5/
[09:22:27] <taplar> yay
[09:22:37] <taplar> so anyway.  you said you wanted some extra divs
[09:22:49] <Cork> hellyeah: except why are you just blindly appending the new clone to body?
[09:23:06] <Cork> you should create the clone, then modify the data then collect them
[09:23:11] <Cork> and then append them all in one go
[09:23:15] <taplar> true
[09:23:16] <tb_b_> tyurd: that code is a sample page / the original site is more messi
[09:23:17] <Cork> else you will get a ton of reflow
[09:23:22] <Cork> and you DON'T want that
[09:23:30] <taplar> $.map() is useful for this
[09:23:31] <Cork> reflow is the most expensive action a browser has
[09:23:33] <Cork> ya
[09:23:45] <hellyeah> ic
[09:23:49] <hellyeah> just a sec
[09:23:56] <hellyeah> hmm $.map()
[09:24:22] <Cork> also...
[09:24:28] <taplar> anyway, got a lot of meetings today.  gonna go afk.  later
[09:24:31] <Cork> your variable is called jsonString
[09:24:34] <tyurd> tb_b_, oh damn
[09:24:35] <Cork> and includes an array
[09:24:41] <Cork> that is a really bad variable name...
[09:25:13] <hellyeah> like that https://jsfiddle.net/w8e04uct/6/
[09:25:29] <DeltaHeavy> Name variables with their purpose, not data structure.
[09:25:43] <hellyeah> DeltaHeavy: ic
[09:26:01] <tyurd> hellyeah, for what is "usingTemplateforCreatingInstance()"?
[09:26:05] <DeltaHeavy> hellyeah I don't see you in #web anymore :p
[09:26:15] <hellyeah> tyurd: function name
[09:26:29] <tyurd> hellyeah, i know. but why you are using it exactly? 3:
[09:26:32] <hellyeah> DeltaHeavy: i am banned and buck wont remove it for good i guess
[09:26:55] <hellyeah> tyurd: for wrapping it in a function with a logical name
[09:27:08] <hellyeah> i will be banned forever DeltaHeavy
[09:27:13] <tyurd> hellyeah, ah. but its pretty long
[09:27:18] <hellyeah> because each time he sabotaged me
[09:28:19] <hellyeah> tyurd: ic
[09:28:40] <hellyeah> the inspiration of function name i am using template for creating element.
[09:28:46] <Cork> hellyeah: https://jsfiddle.net/w8e04uct/7/
[09:29:30] <Cork> [1] in there is to grab the second element, as the first and last is textnodes
[09:29:43] <Cork> "  "
[09:30:25] <hellyeah> what is product?
[09:30:33] <hellyeah> function(product)
[09:30:53] <hellyeah> product is variable i move everything there
[09:30:55] <hellyeah> ?
[09:30:59] <Bheam> gaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah
[09:31:07] <Cork> $.map(products, function(product) {})
[09:31:25] <Cork> hellyeah: i renamed the jsonString to a more descriptive variable
[09:31:29] <hellyeah> ic
[09:31:32] <hellyeah> products
[09:31:35] <Cork> especially as what you worked with wasn't a string
[09:32:01] <hellyeah> basically you move row into product
[09:32:03] <hellyeah> ?
[09:32:17] <Cork> it loops the products
[09:32:32] <Cork> creates a new template clone (row) for each product
[09:32:37] <hellyeah> it loops the products yeah
[09:32:38] <Cork> and then build an array of the result
[09:32:55] <Cork> that array is then given to .append that appends it all to the body
[09:33:02] <Cork> (in one go)
[09:34:00] <hellyeah> good
[09:34:11] <hellyeah> so you build an array and append to body
[09:34:27] <hellyeah> in one go instead of appending to body over and over again
[09:34:33] <hellyeah> i guess i need to study for map
[09:35:09] <Cork> hellyeah: just put the output from $.map into a variable and look at what you get
[09:35:22] <Cork> it is fairly simple
[09:36:02] <hellyeah> Cork: can youı demonstrate?
[09:36:15] <Cork> i just did...
[09:36:20] <Cork> just look at the demo you have
[09:37:01] <tb_b_> could anyone help me out, before im going nuts
[09:38:23] <Cork> tb_b_: what is the question?
[09:38:43] <hellyeah> i am sorry i understand
[09:38:47] <Cork> (reask the question with a bit of an interval if ppl isn't answering, it is quite easy to miss them)
[09:39:16] <tb_b_> i want only count that target=User hrefs if the third <td> underneath hasn't an specific text in my case "me you should count"  I've updated the example
[09:39:24] <tb_b_> https://jsfiddle.net/pts7xbon/5/
[09:40:39] <Cork> tb_b_: what should differentiate the element that should be counted from the one that isn't?
[09:40:59] <Cork> basing it on text in the element is a bad idea
[09:42:07] <DeltaHeavy> Anybody have any experiance with the HTML5 constraints API? I want to allow for a global way to BLOCK user input (eg press '.' in <input type="number" step="1">) instead of just doing it on form submit. This is what I have so far - http://codepen.io/mpalmr/pen/eJJRwq?editors=001
[09:43:44] <Cork> DeltaHeavy: html5 is a marketing term and means nothing
[09:43:55] <DeltaHeavy> No, it's an official specification.
[09:44:00] <Cork> no it isn't
[09:44:07] <Cork> the official specification is "html"
[09:44:40] <DeltaHeavy> If you follow WHATWG which I generally do for HTML. W3C calls it "HTML5".
[09:44:42] <DeltaHeavy> http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/
[09:44:46] <Cork> DeltaHeavy: https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/
[09:44:55] <Cork> that is the spec ^
[09:44:58] <DeltaHeavy> Either way no reason to be anal about it :p You clearly understand what aI'm saying.
[09:45:02] <Cork> html5 has been left over for marketing
[09:45:03] <DeltaHeavy> See my first response.
[09:45:18] <tb_b_> Cork: i was hoping this would do it -> .not('td:has(a[target="User"]):nth-child(3):contains("you should not count me ")
[09:45:19] <Cork> as it means video, encoding, javascript, http2, css3 and so on
[09:45:20] <DeltaHeavy> It depends on who's standard you're looking at.
[09:45:33] <Cork> DeltaHeavy: the standard that browsers look at
[09:45:38] <Cork> and that is NOT the w3 spec
[09:45:48] <DeltaHeavy> Ok, either way I don't really care. You're kind of being anal :p
[09:45:52] <Cork> heck browsers actively ignore the w3 spec
[09:45:55] <DeltaHeavy> I appreciate you trying to help though
[09:46:07] <DeltaHeavy> But I understand, I'm speaking colloquially.
[09:46:29] <Cork> DeltaHeavy: so what spec component are you talking about?
[09:46:34] <Cork> form?
[09:46:51] <DeltaHeavy> Cork Constraints API
[09:47:15] <Cork> so form validation
[09:48:01] <DeltaHeavy> Yep
[09:48:06] <Cork> DeltaHeavy: form validation doesn't prevent the user from entering characters
[09:48:16] <Cork> it just prevents them from submitting (with a validation error)
[09:48:19] <DeltaHeavy> Well that's what I want to do using the constraints API.
[09:48:36] <Cork> that is still how that works
[09:48:40] <DeltaHeavy> I can already determine if the input is valid, I just don't know how to 'block' the actual input.
[09:48:59] <Cork> you can't use html form validation for that
[09:49:12] <Cork> it validates, it doesn't restrict
[09:49:21] <DeltaHeavy> That's the functionality I'm adding.
[09:53:05] <DeltaHeavy> The problem is when I use the keydown event it doesn't allow me to use the updated value for the constraints API
[09:53:22] <tb_b_> Cork: do you know where i am going wrong
[09:53:44] <Cork> tb_b_: like i just said, don't select element based on text content, it is a bad idea
[09:54:14] <Cork> tb_b_: it is slow, it is messy, it breaks as soon as the content needs to be changed the slightest
[09:54:16] <Cork> and so on
[09:54:31] <Cork> give the element a class or a data- attribute and select on that
[09:54:44] <Cork> (and id works if the element ever only exist once)
[09:59:08] <tb_b_> Cork:  the site hasn't changed for over ten years, my problem is it does not work even with my selector
[10:10:41] <manrig> i am using jquery deffering plugin - my inline jquery function gives me error in console jquery is not defined
[10:10:43] <manrig> any clues ?
[10:14:32] <deadevilboy> taplar_afk: I already found the solution
[10:15:15] <deadevilboy> taplar_afk: I am a newbie, but what did I told u? if I use jquery load to insert files into my main.php, then jquery can't intercept form submission
[10:16:01] <deadevilboy> taplar_afk: however, if I use php include.. then jquery will intercept that form content and will not  refresh the webpage :D
[10:16:14] <deadevilboy> the only question is...  why??
[10:17:34] <deadevilboy> Cork: are u there
[10:18:00] <Cork> deadevilboy: hard to say without seeing what you are actually sending to the browser
[10:18:10] <Cork> but i suspect you include <script> tags
[10:18:18] <deadevilboy> on js file?
[10:18:21] <deadevilboy> nop
[10:19:31] <hellyeah> Cork: can i ask one more question to you? I am sorry but can you tell me why you returned row[1] again? https://jsfiddle.net/w8e04uct/8/
[10:19:56] <Cork> hellyeah: the array $.map generates need to contain dom elements, not jquery objects
[10:20:20] <hellyeah> i understand
[10:20:22] <Cork> normally that would be [0], but cause of the indentation you have the first and last element in the jquery object is indentation spaces
[10:20:34] <Cork> hence [1] to get the actual dom element
[10:20:36] <hellyeah> humm
[10:21:53] <hellyeah> i would ask why it is not row[0]. Hmm indentation you dont mean code indentation right? It is about html markup?
[10:21:59] <hellyeah> that i have
[10:22:31] <Cork> hellyeah: <script>\n-->  <--<div>
[10:22:39] <Cork> THAT indentation
[10:22:54] <hellyeah> humm
[10:22:56] <hellyeah> ic
[10:23:14] <hellyeah> let me check smt real quick
[10:23:52] <hellyeah> ic
[10:24:01] <deadevilboy> Cork: I didn't touch the JS file
[10:24:09] <deadevilboy> Cork: I made 2 experiments
[10:24:20] <hellyeah> but i do console.log(row[0]) it just gave me bouch of ""
[10:24:20] <DeltaHeavy> Anybody know if I can get the value of input[type="number"] even if it's invalid like '234.' - http://codepen.io/mpalmr/pen/eJJRwq?editors=001
[10:24:23] <Cork> deadevilboy: it isn't about touching...
[10:25:25] <deadevilboy> Cork: the site has a main.php file. then whe you click one button, includes another php file. inside of that u have a nav menu. u click one item and it opens a npva_a, b, c etc .html
[10:25:47] <deadevilboy> Cork: so on one experiment, I use jquery load to load those files
[10:25:52] <Cork> deadevilboy: what happens server side matters very little
[10:25:57] <Cork> that browser never sees this
[10:26:07] <deadevilboy> Cork: on the other, I used php require_once
[10:26:09] <Cork> what matters is the resulting html you send over the wire
[10:26:22] <Cork> so check the html you send instead of the php
[10:26:36] <Cork> it will most likely make it much easier to find the problem
[10:26:56] <deadevilboy> hmm
[10:28:10] <hellyeah> people prefer require_once instead of require i guess
[10:28:14] <hellyeah> is that right?
[10:28:32] <Cork> require_once prevents loading the same code more then once
[10:28:43] <Cork> what is the better choice depends on the situation
[10:28:52] <FoolsRun> Hi, I'm having a super weird problem:  every time I try to return the selected option from a <select> or an <input> radio button I instead get the FIRST option, not the selected one. Has anyone seen this? I've tested across multiple browsers.
[10:28:55] <Cork> but not really on topic for this channel
[10:28:57] <hellyeah> always "depends"
[10:29:02] <hellyeah> :D
[10:29:20] <Cork> FoolsRun: make a jsfiddle demo
[10:29:48] <deadevilboy> Cork: but the problem is not server side.. and I am not relying on that.. what I am saying is, when I use javascript to load another webpage on a div on the main frame, jquery ajax will go to the action page on the form submission
[10:30:34] <deadevilboy> Cork: when I use php include require whatever, then jquery ajax will not go to the action page directly but async and no page refresh
[10:30:44] <Cork> deadevilboy: ya, but you skip the intermediate step
[10:30:56] <Cork> deadevilboy: you look at the php code and what js does and wonder why it doesn't work
[10:31:04] <Cork> but you forget that what really exist is the generated html
[10:31:06] <Cork> so look at TAHT
[10:31:08] <Cork> *THAT
[10:31:38] <hellyeah> is it possible to put an empty div between element which i created dynamically
[10:31:44] <deadevilboy> you mean.. check the DIV content when I use php include/require and when I use jquery load(), is that it?
[10:31:48] <Cork> hellyeah: sure
[10:32:01] <Cork> deadevilboy: no check what content you actually send
[10:32:10] <Cork> not looking at the php code that generates the content
[10:32:23] <deadevilboy> look, cork, the content I send is the same!
[10:32:23] <Cork> the "generates" is the hint here
[10:32:43] <deadevilboy> sent data is the same..
[10:32:44] <hellyeah> generates is it for me?
[10:32:57] <Cork> deadevilboy: uh... you said if i require one thing happens and if i use requre_once something else happens
[10:33:05] <Cork> that indicates the php generation is the problem
[10:33:06] <deadevilboy> the problem is if u have a webpage refresh or not
[10:33:27] <deadevilboy> one thing I notice.. when I use jquery load
[10:33:53] <DarioLap> hi all, I have a synchronous ajax call, but now async: false is deprecated. Another mode to do it?
[10:33:54] <deadevilboy> I see the website calling my js file like example.js?_some_ID
[10:34:09] <deadevilboy> when I use php, I only see example.js
[10:34:29] <Cork> DarioLap: async: false is deprecated cause the web spec has deprecated it
[10:34:33] <FoolsRun> God damnit it works in the fiddle.
[10:34:48] <Cork> DarioLap: and that is cause locking the rendering cause of network and server delay is a really bad idea
[10:35:00] <Cork> DarioLap: the solution is to not do it sync
[10:35:29] <Cork> DarioLap: use deferred to access the response if you need to return the access out of the function you ave
[10:35:30] <Cork> *have
[10:36:48] <hellyeah> Cork: are you suggestion to do it like that https://jsfiddle.net/w8e04uct/10/
[10:37:07] <Cork> hellyeah: no
[10:37:18] <hellyeah> hmm okey
[10:37:21] <Cork> if you want to add extra elements you would have to add it to the array
[10:37:30] <Cork> the $.map returns the array
[10:39:05] <hellyeah> so i need to add to row
[10:40:13] <DarioLap> Cork, thanks, but another mode to wait for the return value after ajax call?
[10:40:18] <Cork> no you need to add the the array $.map generates
[10:40:25] <Cork> hellyeah: it still needs to be a flat array
[10:40:42] <Cork> DarioLap: that is explicitly what sync means..
[10:40:52] <Cork> and like i just said, no sync is deprecated cause it is a bad idea
[10:41:12] <DarioLap> I would avoid using a deprecated method
[10:41:13] <hellyeah> is it false https://jsfiddle.net/w8e04uct/12/ ?
[10:41:25] <Cork> DarioLap: then stop using sync ajax...
[10:41:39] <Cork> DarioLap: sync ajax has been deprecated for over 5 years
[10:42:25] <DarioLap> so if I have to wait for a return value, i must use it?
[10:43:08] <Cork> DarioLap: if you must lock the browser while the network times out or the server response comes back
[10:43:17] <Cork> that is explicitly what sync ajax is
[10:43:38] <Cork> and if you have to use sync ajax you have to use sync ajax, or you aren't using sync ajax...
[10:43:42] <hellyeah> async:false;
[10:43:45] <Cork> should be fairly obvious...
[10:43:51] <Cork> hellyeah: that is the subject...
[10:43:52] <hellyeah> i heard sync ajax is bad idea
[10:44:05] <Cork> hellyeah: please read the conversation before commenting...
[10:44:11] <hellyeah> sorry,
[10:44:52] <Cork> DarioLap: though code doesn't have to be sync to wait for the response
[10:45:01] <Cork> it just can be sync (it has to use callbacks)
[10:45:18] <Cork> *it just can't be*
[10:45:26] <NoiseEee> DarioLap: you'll never understand javascript if you don't embrace the async, use callbacks and deferreds
[10:45:42] <Cork> ya, nothing new in dom is sync
[10:45:48] <Cork> all new apis is async
[10:45:48] <hellyeah> NoiseEee: promise?
[10:45:58] <Cork> promise == deferred
[10:46:06] <Cork> different name same feature
[10:46:09] <hellyeah> ic
[10:46:18] <hellyeah> deferred is lazy calling?
[10:46:23] <Cork> no
[10:46:34] <Cork> nothing lazy about it
[10:46:48] <hellyeah> ic sorry for interrauption
[10:46:54] <Cork> you return an object with a function to attach callbacks to
[10:47:03] <Cork> and later you call a those callbacks
[10:47:20] <Cork> instead of sending in a function to the origination function and it calls it directly
[10:47:37] <hellyeah> ic
[10:47:44] <Cork> a difference example $.ajax({ success: function() {} }); vs $.ajax().done(function() {});
[10:47:57] <Aristy> Hey guys, I have a question
[10:48:18] <Aristy> I'm creating an element like so: jQuery("<img/>", { class: "limk-article-image scale", src: value.getImage() })
[10:48:35] <hellyeah> i read you use done, fail , always insteadl of success, error, complete
[10:48:44] <Aristy> Is there any way to pass a callback to this so I can put the image src dynamically?
[10:48:58] <Cork> Aristy: no
[10:49:02] <Aristy> Such as: jQuery("<img/>").created(function ())
[10:49:26] <Cork> Aristy: actually that question doesn't really make sense...
[10:49:30] <Cork> what are you trying to do?
[10:49:32] <Aristy> I need to get the container's height and width, and request an image like image?h=100&w=210
[10:49:43] <hellyeah> have a good day
[10:49:48] <Aristy> so src: value.getImage() will be like, src: value.getImage(x, y)
[10:49:53] <Cork> ah, you want to know when the image has been loadeD?
[10:49:55] <Cork> *loaded
[10:50:19] <Cork> Aristy: jQuery("<img/>", { class: "limk-article-image scale", src: value.getImage() }).load(function() { console.log('image loaded');  });
[10:50:27] <Aristy> Image won't load. The image-container div will be created and it is responsive. I need to get the container's height and width, so I can request a resized image
[10:50:56] <Cork> Aristy: then you would have to create an element with an empty src
[10:51:03] <Cork> Aristy: and then append it to the page
[10:51:03] <Aristy> For example, if the parent div (.image-container is 50px - 60px), then image's src should be image.png?w=60&h=50
[10:51:07] <deadevilboy> Cork: why when using jquery load the get packet is sending this parameter; "_:'1450280966644'2 ?
[10:51:10] <Cork> and then grab the size of the element
[10:51:19] <Cork> Aristy: also you might want to have a look at <picture>
[10:51:20] <deadevilboy> Cork: why when using jquery load the get packet is sending this parameter; "_:'1450280966644'" ?
[10:51:29] <Cork> or possibly <img imageset>
[10:51:46] <NoiseEee> deadevilboy: so you don't get a cached response from the server
[10:51:53] <deadevilboy> (sorry to duplicate the question... just wanted to substitute 2 for "
[10:51:53] <Cork> deadevilboy: it is cause .load runs $.ajax with cache: false by default
[10:52:21] <deadevilboy> Cork: so that shouldn't be the problem right?
[10:52:45] <Cork> deadevilboy: you would have to provide an example of the problem for anyone to be able to answer this
[10:52:51] <deadevilboy> ok
[10:52:57] <Cork> we can't say what the problem is
[10:52:59] <deadevilboy> I will copy it to fiddle
[10:53:07] <Cork> we can sit here all day and guess the problem
[10:53:12] <Cork> but it won't really make a difference
[10:57:30] <deadevilboy> don't look at the code that is inside comments.. I was testing things
[11:02:50] <deadevilboy> Cork: https://jsfiddle.net/j2v2papn/4/
[11:05:36] <deadevilboy> Cork: and what I was saying is that if I remove main_funcoes.js and use those PHP requires, post_php.js will intercept and prevent normal submit

[11:07:21] <nru> anyone familiar with cxml ?
[11:07:28] <nru> punchout?
[11:08:46] <deadevilboy> Cork: and by the way, that evento.preventDefault() I just inserted it now just to test... the problem is still the same.. the post_php.js is not being called when I use main_funcoes.php
[11:09:09] <deadevilboy> *not .php, .js functions
[11:10:27] <deadevilboy> Cork: and npav_a.html is the form
[11:10:41] <deadevilboy> ID="FORM_a", class="ajax"
[11:32:27] <deadevilboy> Cork: the code is eating your brains? hehehe.. I can't understand that too
[11:36:45] <rfr> Hello, I am trying to show users a modal and redirect them after they close it. However, my method so far http://pastebin.com/G8QfUdm1 does not wait for the modal to be closed by the user. How can I make JS not redirect the user until after they close the modal?

[12:08:43] <coder7of9> hi, has delegate been deprecated?
[12:10:53] <Cork> coder7of9: no
[12:11:03] <coder7of9> thx
[12:11:06] <Cork> coder7of9: it is just a translator for .on now days though (same with .bind)
[12:12:44] <Cork> coder7of9: that is all the code used in delegate now days http://james.padolsey.com/jquery/#v=1.11.2&fn=jQuery.fn.delegate
[12:12:59] <Cork> same for bind http://james.padolsey.com/jquery/#v=1.11.2&fn=jQuery.fn.bind
[13:13:35] <jangoh2> hi guys  why this is not working   if ($('input[name="'+ elementname + '"]').is('input[type=radio]'))
[13:13:45] <jangoh2>  if ($('input[name="'+ elementname + '"]').is('input[type=text]'))    but this works
[13:13:56] <jangoh2> cant check radiotype
[13:14:29] <robertmaxrees> .is() checks if at least one element matches a selector.
[13:14:43] <robertmaxrees> so your selectors are probably bad.  make a fiddle.
[13:15:05] <jangoh2> its under loop
[13:15:12] <robertmaxrees> that doesn't help me at all.
[13:15:16] <robertmaxrees> make a functioning example.
[13:16:04] <jangoh2> http://dpaste.com/248AKX3
[13:16:14] <jangoh2> i am trying to get data from cookies
[13:16:23] <robertmaxrees> uh.
[13:16:36] <Buzzyboy> @.@
[13:16:42] <robertmaxrees> why do people do this?
[13:16:47] <Buzzyboy> I’m scared.
[13:16:58] <robertmaxrees> are you trying to set values for things?
[13:17:49] <jangoh2> i have another one to set them
[13:18:09] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[13:18:10] <jangoh2> if you know cookie plugin see my code
[13:18:11] <robertmaxrees> make a fiddle yo.
[13:18:16] <robertmaxrees> it'll make a lot more sense.
[13:18:19] <robertmaxrees> abstract out the cookies.
[13:21:08] <robertmaxrees> also, your nested loops are weird.
[13:21:18] <robertmaxrees> need to reverse this. instead.
[13:21:50] <robertmaxrees> you basically don't need it - do an each on $('.clientform input,.clientform select, .clientform textarea').each(function(){ and then do lookups for the cookies based on that.
[13:22:20] <jangoh2> $('input[name=term][value="' + var + '"]').prop('checked', true);    main problem cant use a variable like this
[13:22:31] <jangoh2> trying to set value by name
[13:22:33] <robertmaxrees> you shouldn't ever be selecting elements like that in the first place.
[13:22:44] <robertmaxrees> you can do it, but it's not a good idea.
[13:23:38] <jangoh2> so need seperate selector ?
[13:23:46] <robertmaxrees> don't use selectors - use .filter()
[13:24:34] <jangoh2> ok thanx will try with filter
[13:25:09] <robertmaxrees> use it with the function btw.
[13:25:11] <robertmaxrees> not with selectors.
[13:25:52] <jangoh2> ok thanx :)
[13:28:20] <glowdemon1> Hey. http://www.hastebin.com/xixubuwila.coffee - this script seems to make some divs with the .box class bigger than without this script. Why's that?
[13:29:04] <robertmaxrees> it's not doing anything without you moving your mouse over those elements.
[13:29:51] <robertmaxrees> glowdemon1 ^
[13:30:18] <glowdemon1> Huh?
[13:30:37] <robertmaxrees> that code has no impact unless you move your mouse over elements with that class.
[13:30:51] <robertmaxrees> unless that's what you're trying to figure out.
[13:30:54] <glowdemon1> Yeah, but oddly, whenever I add this script, it makes one box have a bigger width than without
[13:31:07] <robertmaxrees> right, when you move your mouse over those elements, right?
[13:31:19] <glowdemon1> Yeah
[13:31:22] <robertmaxrees> right.
[13:31:27] <robertmaxrees> $(this).find('.under').slideDown(500);
[13:31:48] <glowdemon1> Yes
[13:32:02] <robertmaxrees> ... so then what's your question?
[13:32:03] <glowdemon1> but I don't think that should affect the width. Unless there's something I don't know yet
[13:32:16] <glowdemon1> My WIDTH becomes bigger, not height by the way
[13:32:31] <glowdemon1> But the width is supposed to stay the same, with or without script
[13:32:32] <NoiseEee> tmi
[13:32:52] <robertmaxrees> i'll bet the display being swapped between none and block or whatever is what's causing that.
[13:33:01] <glowdemon1> mh
[13:33:09] <glowdemon1> that's got a point, lemme check that
[13:35:45] <haroldjfks> hello, on page I have many li.toto ul ... well, I need to hide that <li class="  toto"> (that's textually) if all the other li INSIDE have style="display:none"  ...can you help me, please? thanks
[13:35:55] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[13:36:14] <robertmaxrees> so if all the children are hidden, hide the parent?
[13:36:33] <haroldjfks> robertmaxrees: yes, exactly...
[13:36:59] <robertmaxrees> use .find('*'); and then a .filter() to see if any children aren't display: none;
[13:37:20] <glowdemon1> mh
[13:37:33] <glowdemon1> re-setting the children's width solved it
[13:40:22] <robertmaxrees> haroldjfks that make sense?
[13:42:01] <haroldjfks> yes, of course...just I'm not good with "if any li child...has display none"
[13:42:13] <robertmaxrees> hence the "use filter()"
[13:42:48] <robertmaxrees> (this is why things like jsfiddle are helpful :) )
[13:57:16] <haroldjfks> robertmaxrees: can you help me here https://jsfiddle.net/9vdsnwaq/ ?
[13:57:46] <haroldjfks> is first part correct?
[13:58:51] <robertmaxrees> you want .find()
[13:58:57] <robertmaxrees> .children() only goes one level.
[14:00:31] <haroldjfks> $('li.toto').find('li').filter(function() ... ?
[14:00:39] <robertmaxrees> lol yes.
[14:01:08] <haroldjfks> but then I need an IF css display none... ?
[14:01:28] <haroldjfks> and returnt $this with display none ? something like that ?
[14:01:29] <robertmaxrees> you need to return out of that function.
[14:01:31] <haroldjfks> return...
[14:01:44] <robertmaxrees> need to return a true or false out of that function.
[14:02:19] <robertmaxrees> also, wrap a ul around your html in that fiddle so it's valid.
[14:05:10] <LindsayMac> hey guys. Im trying to deal with external scripts defining their own jQuery noconflict which is actually conflicting with my loaded version of jQuery...
[14:05:48] <robertmaxrees> then noconflict yours to a different var?
[14:05:53] <LindsayMac> WordPress laods it's own jQuery in noconflict mode and this external script is doing  var $jq=$.noConflict(); which results in Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'noConflict' of undefined
[14:06:49] <LindsayMac> robertmaxrees:  the issue is that $ is reassigned to jQuery when the script is loaded
[14:06:57] <robertmaxrees> heh you're... SOL then.
[14:07:18] <LindsayMac> I suppose I can load my own version of jQuery and noconflict all of my OTHER stuff to match theirs
[14:07:30] <robertmaxrees> errr, you shouldn't be doing that at all.
[14:07:50] <robertmaxrees> why not just upgrade what wordpress gives you?
[14:08:10] <robertmaxrees> alternatively, if WP is conflicting and you want your own, just use yours and leave it be.
[14:08:18] <LindsayMac> robertmaxrees: WP version is the most currentl version, it just loads it using 'jQuery' instead of $
[14:08:31] <LindsayMac> I dont want my own.. this external script wants it's own.
[14:08:42] <LindsayMac> My code is written to work with jQuery the way it is loaded in WP
[14:08:54] <robertmaxrees> then the third party script is flawed.
[14:09:14] <robertmaxrees> it shouldn't run noconflict without verifying first that $ is actually in use.
[14:09:16] <robertmaxrees> that's a red flad imo.
[14:09:21] <LindsayMac> yes agreed. Was wondering if there was some type of workout I could pass jQuery as $ or something
[14:09:26] <LindsayMac> agreed
[14:10:13] <LindsayMac> ugh this is stupid.
[14:10:16] <LindsayMac> I hate this mess
[14:10:21] <robertmaxrees> i'd just use something else at that point.
[14:10:34] <robertmaxrees> what're you trying to use?
[14:10:59] <LindsayMac> the client is using the 'revive adserver' system
[14:11:26] <robertmaxrees> any docs for the bit that's giving you trouble?  i'd wonder if it's configuratble.
[14:12:17] <LindsayMac> robertmaxrees:  yea I am researching that now.
[14:12:45] <LindsayMac> robertmaxrees:  fact is I shouldn't be doing this research.. the company managing their ad networks should be...
[14:12:46] <LindsayMac> arg
[14:13:19] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[14:13:24] <robertmaxrees> why shouldn't you?
[14:14:52] <LindsayMac> Because its not part of my job.. this SHOULD be the job of the company getting paid to configure their ad network server. I gave them the details as to why it wasnt working, where to look for that line, and what to change it to...
[14:15:17] <LindsayMac> I am not that well educated on ad server systems at all... they were hired specifically for that
[14:15:33] <robertmaxrees> except that the locus is on you as a developer to solve problems :)
[14:15:59] <robertmaxrees> and while i'd agree that they shouldn't ship busted code, reading docs and ultimately getting something to work are both things that you should be doing anyway.
[14:16:52] <LindsayMac> yes... I feel like figuring out the problem, pinpointing where it is and how to fix it should be my max contribution. I dont even have access to any part of the revive/openX system
[14:17:10] <LindsayMac> I have no access to the server its installed on, the files, the config, etc
[14:17:46] <robertmaxrees> ultimately, as developers, it's our job to solve problems.  Sometimes the solution requires us to do something non-optimal, but we aren't our own clients :)
[14:17:59] <LindsayMac> of course.. but I can only go so far.
[14:18:17] <robertmaxrees> you can hack a solution for this if need be, but I'd avoid it unless you really need to.
[14:18:48] <LindsayMac> What would the hack solution be?
[14:19:06] <LindsayMac> Currently was considering putting it all in an iframe and running it that way.. which is a PITA and not ideal IMHO
[14:19:25] <robertmaxrees> and will probably break some things.
[14:19:35] <robertmaxrees> since they likely look at the page to gain context and other information.
[14:19:56] <robertmaxrees> there are two - one would be to actually just load and use jquery yourself in not noconflict mode.  the other would be to define a $ object with a dummy noConflict method that does nothing.
[14:20:01] <LindsayMac> yea. exactly. I would have to put a bunch of things inside the iframe and pass info to it
[14:20:36] <LindsayMac> robertmaxrees:  how would defining a $ object that does nothing pass to the other external script?
[14:20:51] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[14:21:07] <robertmaxrees> the other scrips assumes that $.noConflict() exists.
[14:21:12] <LindsayMac> yes.
[14:21:30] <robertmaxrees> so you create $ = { noConflict: function() {} };
[14:21:31] <LindsayMac> So you're saying do $ = jQuery.noConflict(); before the script that uses it loads?
[14:21:52] <LindsayMac> yea ok.
[14:22:01] <robertmaxrees> you could do that, as well, but you could also just give it a dummy object to work with since it makes a terrible assumption.
[14:22:09] <robertmaxrees> but i'll bet there's a config option somewhere.
[14:22:52] <LindsayMac> yea I can't find shit for docs or anything on the system they are using.
[14:23:16] <robertmaxrees> ask the client for them.
[14:23:49] <LindsayMac> i did.. waiting on it
[14:24:50] <mattt_> hey
[14:25:00] <mattt_> can someone help me with adding localstorage to a dropdown
[14:25:22] <mattt_> see https://jsfiddle.net/master412160/zccehkvt/22/
[14:25:31] <deadevilboy> Cork: are u there mate?
[14:26:24] <robertmaxrees> mattt_ what's your question?
[14:26:49] <robertmaxrees> mattt_ because linking to a 1000+ line fiddle isn't helpful.
[14:26:57] <mattt_> well
[14:27:13] <mattt_> I need to remember the country picked
[14:27:20] <mattt_> and store that in the field below
[14:27:28] <mattt_> it will change upon select
[14:27:56] <robertmaxrees> so what's your question?
[14:27:59] <robertmaxrees> where are you lost?
[14:28:30] <mattt_> well
[14:28:37] <mattt_> localStorage has always been a struggle point for me
[14:28:43] <mattt_> I tried it on my own of course
[14:28:52] <mattt_> var countrystore = localStorage.countrystore;
[14:28:54] <robertmaxrees> make a single problem statement, yo - "i need to save something in localstorage but i'm stuck at x"
[14:29:00] <mattt_>   localStorage.countrystore = result;
[14:29:12] <mattt_> I don't know how to store it
[14:29:15] <mattt_> its that simple
[14:29:19] <mattt_> with localstorage
[14:29:27] <mattt_> I tried adding localStorage
[14:29:29] <robertmaxrees> so you're confused about how to read out of localstorage?
[14:29:35] <LindsayMac> robertmaxrees:  thanks a bunch for your insight
[14:29:40] <mattt_> store and read
[14:29:50] <mattt_> never been good at it
[14:29:53] <mattt_> because
[14:29:56] <robertmaxrees> mattt_ https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Storage
[14:29:58] <mattt_> its a dynamic
[14:30:02] <robertmaxrees> .setItem() and .getItem()
[14:30:05] <mattt_> I've read that doc many times
[14:30:26] <mattt_> the localstorage way of setting it up depends alot on what you want to do
[14:30:31] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[14:30:35] <robertmaxrees> you're way convoluting this.
[14:30:40] <robertmaxrees> you just want to setItem and getItem.
[14:30:44] <robertmaxrees> that's all you need to do.
[14:30:47] <mattt_> ok
[14:30:55] <robertmaxrees> i need to go to lunch, but try making a simplified fiddle.
[14:31:04] <amit_sh> hey..how to contribute to jquery?
[14:31:06] <mattt_> most code is from the plugin
[14:31:13] <robertmaxrees> amit_sh ask in #jquery-dev :)
[14:31:17] <mattt_> the only real code is in the doc ready code
[14:31:31] <amit_sh> ok
[14:31:39] <mattt_> Robert
[14:31:44] <mattt_> when will you be back?
[14:33:11] <robertmaxrees> a few hours duder.
[14:33:25] <robertmaxrees> make a standalone example to set and get items in localstorage.
[14:33:52] <robertmaxrees> break the problem down.  good luck :)
[14:35:22] <mattt_> I won't be around, can't stay online that long
[14:41:53] <amit__> connected
[14:50:01] <haroldjfks> robertmaxrees: done :-) (but in other way) https://jsfiddle.net/9vdsnwaq/1/
[14:52:40] <FilipNortic> mattt_: maybe storage doen't like the objects you're storing
[14:54:50] <mattt_> could be
[14:54:55] <mattt_> but I think I'm just doing it wrong
[14:55:05] <mattt_> local storage doesn't have to be done through set and getitem
[14:55:08] <mattt_> there are other ways too
[14:55:22] <notchris> Can you specify two actions for "on"
[14:55:38] <notchris> in ex: .on('click,toggle',function(){});
[14:55:52] <deadevilboy> ppl, I am using a jquery load() to append some html inside DIV on the main page. that load will load html form. Why can't I use then jquery ajax to send it in the background?
[14:56:55] <FilipNortic> mattt_: if you store the iso2 code istead you're it might get better
[14:58:17] <mattt_> yeah
[14:58:19] <mattt_> I guess so
[14:58:54] <FilipNortic> deadevilboy: load is a short for an ajax comand that does elemnt.html()
[14:59:05] <FilipNortic> in callback
[14:59:53] <deadevilboy> FilipNortic: and how does it differ from php include
[14:59:57] <deadevilboy> ?
[15:01:21] <mattt_> I'm really bad at localstorage though https://jsfiddle.net/master412160/zccehkvt/23/
[15:02:38] <FilipNortic> deadevilboy: I don't know any php sry
[15:03:26] <FilipNortic> mattt_: you can do console.log/console.debug(localStroage) to check whats in there
[15:05:15] <deadevilboy> well the problem is that if u have a main webpage and u call some html to some divs, and that html is some forms u have 2 things happening
[15:05:43] <deadevilboy> when u want to submit it via jq ajax, if u use php include, no problem, no page refresh
[15:06:13] <deadevilboy> if u use load() to load the html into the divs, the page is always changing for the action page of the form
[15:08:12] <FilipNortic> all load() does is send a ajax.get() for a string of vallid html form your server and put it in to your specified element
[15:08:38] <deadevilboy> exactly
[15:08:45] <mattt_> nice but I don't know what to do https://jsfiddle.net/master412160/zccehkvt/24/
[15:08:54] <mattt_> I added your code and looked at the console
[15:08:59] <mattt_> but I don't know what to write
[15:09:08] <deadevilboy> but why, after that, can't I trigger the submit of that loaded valid html
[15:09:22] <haroldjfks> pardon, can you explain why this https://jsfiddle.net/9vdsnwaq/3/ doesn't work anymore? it should hide the parent just if all children have display none ....
[15:09:52] <haroldjfks> instead now it hides everything...
[15:11:24] <FilipNortic> mattt_: https://jsfiddle.net/zccehkvt/25/
[15:13:10] <deadevilboy> FilipNortic: u see the pont?
[15:13:31] <deadevilboy> *point
[15:15:42] <mattt_> thank you Filip
[15:16:14] <mattt_> is it meant to already store the chosen field?
[15:16:15] <FilipNortic> deadevilboy: yeah the html from the server maybe dynamic you have to set it server side which php kinde of does
[15:16:42] <FilipNortic> mattt_: it only stores the iso code of the chosen field
[15:16:58] <FilipNortic> you have to look it up yourself on load
[15:17:28] <FilipNortic> when you tried to store the whole field storage converted it to an object array
[15:17:32] <deadevilboy> FilipNortic: but the only question here is that the code is not dynamic.. I am just loading a form... the question is if I call that form with load, I can't handle the submit event to use ajax in the background
[15:18:01] <deadevilboy> FilipNortic: but with php include, it does work in the background
[15:18:25] <deadevilboy> and I would like to understand why.. cause the added html on the element it is the same, via php or load
[15:19:24] <FilipNortic> deadevilboy: then I don't get your point I guess does your form get a diffrent action from when you load it with php?
[15:20:32] <deadevilboy> yes.. if I load it via php, I can trigger the submit and use ajax to send the form to php and then to sql DB without refreshing the webpage
[15:21:05] <deadevilboy> if I load the page with jquery load(), the submit can't be handled or recognized by the return false
[15:21:40] <deadevilboy> and the form is submited the normal way.. I mean.. the page goest to the php file that is expressed in the form action
[15:22:44] <FilipNortic> deadevilboy: load can take a callbackfunction to and you can du what you want there
[15:22:55] <deadevilboy> I know
[15:23:03] <deadevilboy> but that is not the point
[15:24:30] <deadevilboy> imagine a simple website. call it mainwebsite.php, whatever.. u have a main DIV inside.. and u want to include an HTML file with some form
[15:24:37] <FilipNortic> you mean that load cant handle a page refresh of a form submit
[15:24:38] <deadevilboy> what would u do to call it?
[15:25:28] <deadevilboy> I mean... u have a button or a image, it doesn't matter, u click there and it should send the form to some bbla bla bla.php that will connect to the SQL DB
[15:25:48] <deadevilboy> are u following?
[15:26:14] <deadevilboy> then if you use jquery ajax u can send that form without refreshing the webpage right?
[15:26:28] <deadevilboy> and how can u do that? but handling the submit event right?
[15:27:23] <deadevilboy> not but, by I mean
[15:28:14] <FilipNortic> ajax is always not triggering the subimt event
[15:28:23] <FilipNortic> unless you do so yourself
[15:28:27] <deadevilboy> right
[15:28:37] <deadevilboy> that is why u put return false
[15:29:04] <FilipNortic> where did you put retun false it onlyn
[15:29:36] <deadevilboy> $('form.ajax').submit(function() { return false });
[15:30:40] <FilipNortic> that won't do anything
[15:30:49] <deadevilboy> right
[15:31:00] <deadevilboy> that wont let submit go the normal way
[15:31:06] <deadevilboy> and then, inside that js code
[15:31:15] <deadevilboy> I use $.ajax to send the code
[15:31:21] <deadevilboy> throught php file
[15:31:25] <deadevilboy> *through
[15:31:50] <FilipNortic> you can just make sure not to submit the form at all instead of using retun false
[15:31:55] <deadevilboy> that way u can send/post without page refresh
[15:32:27] <FilipNortic> you can send post with ajax anyway
[15:32:43] <FilipNortic> unless you have it bound to a button inside a from
[15:33:12] <FilipNortic> and then all you need is an event.preventDefault() on the click event and it won't trigger submit
[15:33:51] <deadevilboy> yes
[15:33:57] <deadevilboy> but that I understand
[15:34:02] <deadevilboy> what I don't understand
[15:35:01] <deadevilboy> is why I can't use ajax to send after preventing to submit
[15:35:44] <FilipNortic> cause return false will stop all click events on that button
[15:37:04] <FilipNortic> $('form.ajax').submit(function(event) { event.preventDefault(); }); instead
[15:37:13] <deadevilboy> yes
[15:37:22] <FilipNortic> but that i still a strange way to do it
[15:37:23] <deadevilboy> but the the $.ajax won't work
[15:37:33] <deadevilboy> *then
[15:37:46] <deadevilboy> why?
[15:38:18] <FilipNortic> where do you have the ajax call in the submit function or in a click function bound on the same button?
[15:40:00] <FilipNortic> deadevilboy: you will poboply need to show me atleast some code before I can tell you why
[15:40:11] <deadevilboy> FilipNortic: see this
[15:40:19] <deadevilboy> https://jsfiddle.net/kpd9tzxh/1/
[15:40:37] <deadevilboy> and check post_php.js file
[15:41:20] <deadevilboy> and forget that first return false
[15:41:35] <deadevilboy> I put it there but it shouldn't be
[15:43:06] <FilipNortic> deadevilboy: $('.ajax').submit(function()
[15:43:14] <FilipNortic> this is not an ajax call
[15:43:37] <deadevilboy> now.. but it was to detect and prevent the submit
[15:43:42] <deadevilboy> .ajax is the class of the form
[15:43:48] <deadevilboy> or form.ajax
[15:44:15] <deadevilboy> u can put #FORM_a
[15:44:19] <deadevilboy> the id of the form
[15:44:23] <deadevilboy> it doesn't matter
[15:44:38] <deadevilboy> but that code is not beeing interpreted by the website
[15:44:56] <deadevilboy> don't know why.. only happens if I insert html into divs using jquery load
[15:46:03] <deadevilboy> I use alert.. and it is calling that js file, however, it is not recognizing the form ID, class or whatever
[15:46:21] <deadevilboy> does that mean that using load, it won't be recognized as an element?
[15:47:23] <FilipNortic> you have put everything in anomouys jQuery function and they don't execute
[15:49:00] <FilipNortic> deadevilboy: is it cause the php clashes with the $
[15:53:04] <deadevilboy> FilipNortic: hmm
[15:53:16] <deadevilboy> because loading php won't work
[15:53:18] <deadevilboy> is that it?
[15:54:42] <FilipNortic> deadevilboy: no the functions you have there won't execute
[15:54:55] <deadevilboy> yes, that is what is happening
[15:55:05] <deadevilboy> they only work if I use php include
[15:55:11] <deadevilboy> to include the form
[15:55:19] <deadevilboy> inside main page div
[15:56:19] <deadevilboy> can I use php include inside a jquery click event?
[15:59:09] <NoiseEee> deadevilboy: you can make an xhr/ajax request to a server where a php file is located when something is clicked, if thats what you're really asking
[16:01:00] <FilipNortic> NoiseEee: i started there to but he is wondering why his ajax call isn't executing
[16:13:55] <haroldjfks> hello, I have li.toto a ul  ...then other li elements ... I just need to hide the parent li.toto if all those li are not visible (display none)... I'm not able to do it correct. Can you help me, please?
[16:17:39] <FilipNortic> haroldjfks: if($('li.toto:visible').length===0){$(li.toto).parent().hide()}
[16:19:13] <haroldjfks> FilipNortic: it doesn't work https://jsfiddle.net/9vdsnwaq/4/ there "Feste e maschere" should be hidden now...
[16:20:43] <haroldjfks> understood what I need ?
[16:22:25] <FilipNortic> haroldjfks: your top level li has class toto aswell
[16:23:16] <FilipNortic> haroldjfks: and why have li:s directly in body
[16:23:30] <haroldjfks> indeed...so I need to hide the first li.toto
[16:24:12] <FilipNortic> haroldjfks: based on what criteria?
[16:24:33] <haroldjfks> IF all the children li have style display none...
[16:25:13] <FilipNortic> well do you have to have the same class name for the children?
[16:25:38] <haroldjfks> unfortunately I can't change that...it comes from Prestashop, that's a mess...
[16:28:30] <haroldjfks> someone suggested to use find filter....
[16:29:37] <haroldjfks> $('li.toto').find('li').filter(function() ...
[16:30:26] <haroldjfks> or an each ..?
[16:32:20] <haroldjfks> then I'm lost inside the filter...
[16:32:41] <FilipNortic> an each would have worked if the ul in the one that was suppose to be visible wasn't display:none
[16:34:05] <haroldjfks> my logic would be: for each li inside li.toto which is visible increment a variable...if at the end the variable is == 0 ...then hide the li.toto
[16:34:10] <haroldjfks> could that work?
[16:34:39] <FilipNortic> it would
[16:34:44] <FilipNortic> sry
[16:35:01] <FilipNortic> I mean same problem they are not visible
[16:35:25] <FilipNortic> cause their parent ul has display:none
[16:35:47] <haroldjfks> I mean css display none better than "visible"
[16:37:12] <FilipNortic> yeah but why do you want to check a child if it would be visible if it parent wasn't hidden that is backwards
[16:40:01] <deadevilboy> sorry
[16:40:23] <deadevilboy> I was dinning
[16:47:51] <FilipNortic> deadevilboy: well the it still strange to fire ajax from inside the sumbmit event. the more normal way would be to bind aclick event on a button and use preventDefault() to stop submit
[16:48:03] <robertmaxrees> that's actually not normal, FilipNortic
[16:48:09] <robertmaxrees> you want to prevent the submit event on the form.
[16:48:24] <deadevilboy> yes.. but now I did another experiment
[16:48:24] <robertmaxrees> because semantically that's what you're doing.
[16:48:34] <robertmaxrees> users use their enter key to submit forms all the time ;)
[16:48:40] <deadevilboy> and just use that js file as a function testing()
[16:48:46] <deadevilboy> and then I call it in the page
[16:49:21] <deadevilboy> and the alert takes place so I know it is calling the file.. however, the submit is not working
[16:49:46] <deadevilboy> I can only think of one thing
[16:49:57] <deadevilboy> it is not recognizing the inserted HTML
[16:50:45] <FilipNortic> robertmaxrees: just to be clear what he is doing is $(form).submit({function(){ajax(...) callback; return false;}
[16:50:55] <robertmaxrees> that's the wrong syntax for that.
[16:51:06] <robertmaxrees> but yeah, that's pretty much what you do.
[16:51:17] <robertmaxrees> deadevilboy is the form dynamically insterted into the page?
[16:52:04] <deadevilboy> robertmaxrees: if I insert it using php include, I have no problems submiting.. if I use jquery load, It won't work
[16:52:08] <robertmaxrees> right.
[16:52:13] <robertmaxrees> because the event isn't actually point.
[16:52:22] <robertmaxrees> can't bind to something that doesn't exist when you run the binding.
[16:52:27] <robertmaxrees> use event delegation instea.d
[16:52:53] <deadevilboy> hmm.. that is what I thought.. it doesn't exist
[16:53:07] <deadevilboy> but why, if it is added into the main page DIV ?
[16:53:09] <robertmaxrees> right - you cannot bind to something unless it already exists.
[16:53:20] <robertmaxrees> regardless of where you insert it.
[16:53:25] <robertmaxrees> you need to use a delegated listener instead.
[16:53:30] <deadevilboy> hmm
[16:53:51] <robertmaxrees> $('parent').on('submit', 'form', function(e) { e.preventDefault(); });
[16:53:54] <deadevilboy> you mean using on
[16:53:56] <deadevilboy> exactly
[16:53:59] <robertmaxrees> not exactly.
[16:54:05] <robertmaxrees> that second argument is the important part.
[16:54:17] <deadevilboy> let me try
[16:54:19] <robertmaxrees> .on() does NOT automatically mean you're using a delegated listener.
[16:54:30] <robertmaxrees> see how I bind to a parent and then pass 'form' as a second arg?
[16:55:28] <deadevilboy> yes
[16:55:34] <robertmaxrees> that's what makes that work right.,
[16:55:46] <deadevilboy> hmmm I understand the principle then
[16:55:54] <deadevilboy> I guess that was the problem
[16:56:06] <deadevilboy> because it was like the form selector didn't exist
[16:56:11] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events
[16:56:13] <deadevilboy> I will try it
[16:56:20] <robertmaxrees> this has all the reading you'd need on it.
[16:56:27] <robertmaxrees> but yeah, the element you bind to must exist on pagelaod.
[16:56:38] <deadevilboy> thanks a lot (u all) for the effort
[16:56:43] <deadevilboy> I will try it in a sec
[16:56:54] <robertmaxrees> binding to a parent that exists and then listening for the event to bubble through the document is the idea.
[16:56:54] <FilipNortic> load will execute scripttags in the html but delegating is much better
[16:57:10] <robertmaxrees> don't load JS using ajax.
[16:57:12] <robertmaxrees> like, ever.
[16:57:21] <robertmaxrees> that's a short path to frustration and hair pulling.
[16:57:51] <FilipNortic> well there is getScript right
[16:58:00] <deadevilboy> hmm I see the point
[16:58:06] <deadevilboy> make it simple
[16:59:23] <FilipNortic> and delegate won't work if you return false
[16:59:33] <FilipNortic> (I think atleast)
[17:00:01] <FilipNortic> then event propagation might stop
[17:00:30] <FilipNortic> robertmaxrees: have i got that part right?
[17:00:55] <FilipNortic> or is thar how old browsers did it
[17:01:40] <robertmaxrees> FilipNortic uh.
[17:01:41] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[17:01:58] <robertmaxrees> returning false just does e.preventDefault(); and e.stopImmediatePropagation() iirc.
[17:02:20] <robertmaxrees> event propagation won't work for other listeners, but your delegated listener will still work.
[17:03:09] <FilipNortic> hmm might have been in the olden days that it broke then
[17:05:54] <deadevilboy> robertmaxrees: the parent that I should call is the one where the code is being loaded?
[17:06:09] <FilipNortic> These handlers, therefore, may prevent the delegated handler from triggering by calling event.stopPropagation() or returning false. (.live() and  delegate().)
[17:06:52] <FilipNortic> deadevilboy: you can put it on any parent but the closer the better
[17:07:21] <FilipNortic> the element just have to be pressent when page loads (or js loads)
[17:07:44] <deadevilboy> but then it is never present
[17:07:54] <deadevilboy> cause I wait and when I click, the event doesn't work
[17:07:56] <FilipNortic> I mean the parrrent element
[17:08:03] <robertmaxrees> back
[17:08:29] <robertmaxrees> FilipNortic uh.
[17:08:36] <robertmaxrees> you're conflating what preventDefault does.
[17:09:01] <robertmaxrees> deadevilboy does that parent exist on pageload.
[17:09:03] <FilipNortic> http://api.jquery.com/event.stopimmediatepropagation/
[17:09:12] <robertmaxrees> FilipNortic that's not stopPropagation ;)
[17:09:20] <FilipNortic> additional notes
[17:09:22] <robertmaxrees> and your delegated listener will still work.  others may not.
[17:09:32] <robertmaxrees> that is not the same thing we were talking about fwiw.
[17:09:39] <deadevilboy> well that parent yes
[17:09:53] <robertmaxrees> and that talks about live and delegate - don't use those anyway.  use .on()
[17:09:58] <deadevilboy> the load() is being used to insert data into that parent div id
[17:10:08] <robertmaxrees> deadevilboy do you have a console.log() in your code to verify it's not some other issue?
[17:11:00] <deadevilboy> i will do it right now
[17:11:33] <deadevilboy> but maybe doesn't work because a partent calls a child and that child will call another (the form is in this last)
[17:11:40] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[17:11:55] <deadevilboy> *parent
[17:12:05] <FilipNortic> from .on now: Returning false from an event handler will automatically call event.stopPropagation() and event.preventDefault().
[17:12:16] <robertmaxrees> FilipNortic correct.
[17:12:22] <robertmaxrees> neither of those are the method you linted.
[17:12:25] <robertmaxrees> *linked
[17:12:26] <deadevilboy> main site ---> u click a button and jquery loads a another php inside of that. then u click that new one and opens another with form
[17:12:45] <robertmaxrees> deadevilboy you need to bind to a parent element that exists on pageload.
[17:12:58] <deadevilboy> yes
[17:12:59] <robertmaxrees> that could even be the document if you really needed (which i'd avoid).
[17:13:08] <deadevilboy> I did that
[17:13:19] <robertmaxrees> and the console.log() isn't firing?
[17:13:24] <deadevilboy> I will check log
[17:14:49] <deadevilboy> nothing on console log
[17:14:54] <robertmaxrees> no errors?
[17:15:03] <robertmaxrees> even if you load the page and click everything to get to where you need to be?
[17:15:10] <FilipNortic> robertmaxrees: sry for mixing things up but stopPropagtion() will stop delegate right?
[17:15:23] <robertmaxrees> FilipNortic correct.
[17:15:27] <FilipNortic> or delegated on events
[17:15:39] <FilipNortic> defered is the word
[17:15:40] <robertmaxrees> it will stop the event frop propagation up through the document.
[17:15:52] <robertmaxrees> nope, deferred is not the word you're looking for.
[17:15:57] <deadevilboy> hmm I will click manually
[17:16:02] <robertmaxrees> dead  the console.log() isn't firing?
[17:16:03] <robertmaxrees> [2015:12:16:14:13:25] <deadevilboy> I will check
[17:16:04] <robertmaxrees> err.
[17:16:07] <robertmaxrees> http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide1
[17:16:10] <robertmaxrees> there we go.
[17:16:11] <deadevilboy> no, no fire in the consolo
[17:16:13] <robertmaxrees> check this guide out.
[17:16:30] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, make a standalone test case with static markup.
[17:18:55] <sdwrage_> Anyone use DataTables with responsive layout? For some reason the responsive breakpoints inputs don't have the original values
[17:20:08] <robertmaxrees> sdwrage_ you can feel free to ask here, but you'll probably get more help in their forums.
[17:20:41] <sdwrage_> yeah, if all else fails ill post in the forums. Gotta have this done by end of week
[17:20:51] <robertmaxrees> i'd actually start there.
[17:20:54] <robertmaxrees> or post there AND ask here.
[17:20:59] <robertmaxrees> you'll likely save time :)
[17:24:14] <sdwrage_> okay. ill post there first
[17:24:18] <sdwrage_> thanks
[17:26:23] <deadevilboy> robertmaxrees: thks, and Filip too
[17:26:29] <deadevilboy> I am debuggin
[17:26:32] <robertmaxrees> rad
[17:26:32] <deadevilboy> trying to see
[17:26:35] <deadevilboy> what is happening
[17:26:43] <deadevilboy> step by step
[17:26:56] <robertmaxrees> as well as typing it step by step ;)
[17:27:03] <haroldjfks> ok, I was able to change the first li class...now is easier...let me change the jsfiddle
[17:27:13] <robertmaxrees> what's going on?
[17:27:19] <taplar> am i the only one that went......... day by day..
[17:29:08] <deadevilboy> robertmaxrees: I used an alert
[17:29:17] <robertmaxrees> don't use alerts.
[17:29:18] <robertmaxrees> like, evenr.
[17:29:20] <FilipNortic> haroldjfks: are you still looking for children inside a hidden parrent that would be visible if the parent was
[17:29:24] <robertmaxrees> use the debugger or the console?
[17:29:26] <robertmaxrees> *.
[17:29:36] <NoiseEee> fixingthesejquery.com/#slide1 @ deadevilboy
[17:29:38] <deadevilboy> and child divs are already recognize when js file is requested
[17:29:41] <deadevilboy> ok
[17:29:47] <NoiseEee> http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide1 @ deadevilboy
[17:30:23] <robertmaxrees> ^^^ this is your new best friend.
[17:30:24] <robertmaxrees> us it.
[17:30:30] <haroldjfks> well, now...anyone who knows how my logic doesn't work here https://jsfiddle.net/9vdsnwaq/5/
[17:30:31] <robertmaxrees> *use it.  it'll change the way you write code.
[17:30:41] <robertmaxrees> *sigh*
[17:30:56] <robertmaxrees> haroldjfks fwiw you need to use valid markup fragments.
[17:31:13] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/9vdsnwaq/6/ need a ul around everything.
[17:32:10] <kevireilly> line 1 probably needs to set it to 0 `var $counter = 0;` and line 9 is missing a closing parenthesis )
[17:33:43] <haroldjfks> doesn't work...now it hides all..while the first category should be visible
[17:33:55] <FilipNortic> haroldjfks: yes and you can get around the problem I mentioned but it a pain and I still can't see the reason you would need to do this
[17:34:06] <haroldjfks> https://jsfiddle.net/9vdsnwaq/8/
[17:34:13] <FilipNortic> s/it/it's
[17:34:47] <robertmaxrees> haroldjfks so waht were you trying to fix again?
[17:34:58] <deadevilboy> robertmaxrees: the form ID is red in debugging console
[17:35:03] <deadevilboy> how can I see why?
[17:35:15] <robertmaxrees> deadevilboy no idea what you're talking about
[17:35:37] <FilipNortic> might mean manny elemnts with same id
[17:35:46] <FilipNortic> but just a guess
[17:35:47] <deadevilboy> hmm
[17:35:50] <robertmaxrees> probably not.
[17:35:52] <deadevilboy> nop
[17:35:55] <robertmaxrees> deadevilboy what do you mean?
[17:36:02] <robertmaxrees> are you getting an error of some kind?
[17:36:19] <robertmaxrees> haroldjfks what was it you were trying to accomplish again?
[17:36:20] <deadevilboy> I was looking into firebug
[17:36:23] <deadevilboy> and in DOM
[17:36:38] <deadevilboy> the form that was supposed to be submited is in a red color
[17:36:53] * NoiseEee gives drugs to robertmaxrees
[17:36:59] <robertmaxrees> i have no idea what you're referencing mano.
[17:37:24] <robertmaxrees> can you give me a screenshot or something?
[17:37:24] <haroldjfks> maybe understood why doesn't work... in this way it selects all the li on the page... I need to select one block at a time...how to do it?
[17:37:34] <robertmaxrees> haroldjfks what are you trying to accomplish?
[17:37:42] <deadevilboy> hmm let me just check one thing
[17:37:55] <haroldjfks> in this example https://jsfiddle.net/9vdsnwaq/9/
[17:38:06] <haroldjfks> "Feste e maschere" should be hidden
[17:38:18] <haroldjfks> 'cause all its li are with display none
[17:38:20] <robertmaxrees> why?
[17:38:35] <haroldjfks> "'cause all its li are with display none"
[17:38:37] <robertmaxrees> err.
[17:39:05] <robertmaxrees> okay, for each direct descendent of that first ul.
[17:40:18] <robertmaxrees> except that your logic is nonsense.
[17:40:27] <robertmaxrees> <li class="  toto"> <span class="grower CLOSE"> </span><a href="http://myweb.com/itest/117-costumi-e-maschere" title="">Costumi e maschere</a> that isn't hidden.
[17:40:28] <deadevilboy> robertmaxrees: http://snag.gy/9NpeX.jpg
[17:40:32] <robertmaxrees> so your code will never work.
[17:40:51] <robertmaxrees> yeah haroldjfks use the developer tools build into your browser instead of trying to use firebug.
[17:41:09] <robertmaxrees> and that shouldn't be an issue.
[17:41:22] <haroldjfks> the ul class is ul.tree.dynamized
[17:41:39] <robertmaxrees> haroldjfks your problem statement isn't accurate.
[17:42:41] <robertmaxrees> not all of the LIs within that element are display: none;
[17:43:03] <robertmaxrees> perhaps you meant "'cause all its li aren't visible"?
[17:43:09] <haroldjfks> ok, indeed..I just need to hide when ALL are display none...
[17:43:19] <robertmaxrees> lol.
[17:43:45] <haroldjfks> hide the parent
[17:43:52] <robertmaxrees> except that's not what you want apparently.
[17:43:56] <haroldjfks> which is li.first.toto
[17:44:36] <robertmaxrees> are you listening?  Feste e maschere will always be visible.
[17:44:48] <haroldjfks> where
[17:44:55] <haroldjfks> is the error?
[17:45:01] <robertmaxrees> <li class="  toto">
[17:45:07] <robertmaxrees> that LI is not display: none;
[17:45:41] <haroldjfks> ops, sorry... I was on the wrong page :-)
[17:46:09] <haroldjfks> changed the site for a test site where the database is different lol
[17:46:18] <robertmaxrees> so then start with a simplified fieeld.
[17:46:20] <robertmaxrees> *fiddle
[17:47:49] <haroldjfks> first I need to gunzip the new database...otherwise it's a mess to test
[17:47:54] <robertmaxrees> no.
[17:47:55] <robertmaxrees> stop.
[17:47:58] <robertmaxrees> you need simplified HTML.
[17:48:35] <haroldjfks> I can't...that's the HTML, already edited to show the first li as li.first.toto
[17:48:44] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/9vdsnwaq/10/
[17:48:48] <robertmaxrees> here's some simplified html.
[17:49:12] <haroldjfks> ah, ops..wasn't clear what you meant
[17:49:14] <haroldjfks> ok
[17:50:34] <deadevilboy> robertmaxrees:  I tryed console.log
[17:50:38] <deadevilboy> $('#conteudo').on('submit', '#FORM_a', function(e) {
[17:50:42] <deadevilboy> this is not running
[17:50:45] <robertmaxrees> deadevilboy what is #FORM_a ?
[17:50:52] <robertmaxrees> are you sure your selectors are correct?
[17:50:55] <deadevilboy> it is being imported with load
[17:51:19] <deadevilboy> main div (parent) loads a child html and that last another child
[17:51:26] <robertmaxrees> and #contenteudo isn't repeated on the page?  and it's a parent of that element?  and it always exists, never replaced?
[17:51:36] <deadevilboy> but when calling selector length
[17:51:43] <deadevilboy> everything is 1 (true)
[17:51:50] <robertmaxrees> it always will be depending.
[17:52:01] <robertmaxrees> even if you repeat IDs.
[17:52:35] <robertmaxrees> $('#someid') will always be 1 - it shortcuts to getElementById.  try $('[id="contenteudo"]').length
[17:52:39] <deadevilboy> yes.. I tried with class too
[17:52:57] <deadevilboy> and I only used one class on the whole page
[17:53:14] <deadevilboy> and the class is for the form, exclusively
[17:53:37] <robertmaxrees> dunno then duder.
[17:53:43] <robertmaxrees> without seeing it it's almost impossible to help you.
[17:53:57] <robertmaxrees> stop through code and make sure you selectors are bound to the things you think they're bound to.
[17:54:02] <deadevilboy> #conteudo is the parent.. then conteudo will load a page, that will have a child div called #npav_content
[17:54:20] <robertmaxrees> deadevilboy repeating yourself isn't goiing to change anything :)
[17:54:26] <robertmaxrees> haroldjfks https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/9vdsnwaq/12/ this is what i suggested a few hours ago.
[17:54:52] <deadevilboy> yep
[17:55:09] <deadevilboy> I check at the dom
[17:55:17] <robertmaxrees> check it in your debugger duder.
[17:55:18] <deadevilboy> and the whole code after the load
[17:55:31] <deadevilboy> and there are no repetitions of ids
[17:55:34] <robertmaxrees> learn to use your step debugger - this is when it's helpful.
[17:55:51] <deadevilboy> the code stops after calling the function in the JS file
[17:56:10] <deadevilboy> so the on submit is not being called
[17:57:52] <deadevilboy> what if I use find?
[17:57:55] <robertmaxrees> dude
[17:57:59] <robertmaxrees> .find() won't help here.
[17:58:21] <robertmaxrees> it sounds like your bindings are totally hose OR they're not firing.
[17:58:26] <deadevilboy> but .find was calling the form and submiting
[17:58:33] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[17:58:40] <robertmaxrees> .find() shouldn't be calling and submitting anything.
[17:58:44] <robertmaxrees> show us your code.
[17:58:55] <deadevilboy> $("#npav_content_text2").find("#"+formulario).submit();
[17:59:04] <deadevilboy> in this case formulario is FORM_a
[17:59:09] <robertmaxrees> that's completely useless.
[17:59:17] <robertmaxrees> $("#"+formulario).submit(); is faster in that case.
[17:59:22] <deadevilboy> but that way the form is submited
[17:59:39] <deadevilboy> your way doesn't work
[17:59:47] <robertmaxrees> then you're repeating that ID on the page.
[17:59:47] <deadevilboy> and it should
[17:59:53] <robertmaxrees> or have some other issue.
[18:00:03] <robertmaxrees> until you show us your code, there's nothing we can do.
[18:00:04] <robertmaxrees> :)
[18:01:33] <deadevilboy> robertmaxrees: https://jsfiddle.net/kpd9tzxh/2/
[18:02:20] <robertmaxrees> so what am I looking at here?
[18:02:52] <robertmaxrees> also i'm seeing a lot of php, not markup.
[18:04:48] <deadevilboy> see the javascript
[18:04:57] <deadevilboy> check the first JS file
[18:04:59] <robertmaxrees> ...
[18:05:05] <robertmaxrees> give me specifics to look at.
[18:05:13] <deadevilboy> html check lines
[18:05:27] <deadevilboy> 134+
[18:05:41] <deadevilboy> and then check the first js file
[18:05:41] <robertmaxrees> uh why are those in the html?
[18:05:43] <robertmaxrees> that's js?
[18:05:47] <robertmaxrees> that should bein a js file.
[18:06:30] <deadevilboy> no
[18:06:34] <robertmaxrees> yes.
[18:06:34] <deadevilboy> js file is / MAIN_FUNCOES.JS FILE *************************************** function test() {
[18:06:47] <robertmaxrees> all js should be in a fidle.
[18:06:49] <robertmaxrees> not in your html.
[18:06:51] <robertmaxrees> looks like you're way lost here - keep running through that tutorial i gave you
[18:06:56] <robertmaxrees> it'll really help you figure this out.
[18:08:01] <deadevilboy> I know where the code doesn't start
[18:08:06] <deadevilboy> but don't know why
[18:08:09] <deadevilboy> u see the point
[18:08:31] <robertmaxrees> sure - sounds like you need to back up and refactor some things.
[18:08:39] <deadevilboy> look
[18:08:43] <deadevilboy> this is simply to understand
[18:08:57] <robertmaxrees> "i'm not sure where to start" -> "this is simple"
[18:08:58] <deadevilboy> if I call things with php include
[18:09:01] <deadevilboy> all that code works
[18:09:02] <deadevilboy> u see?
[18:09:08] <robertmaxrees> i explained earlier what you need to know.
[18:09:12] <robertmaxrees> your event bindings are hosed.
[18:09:25] <deadevilboy> so the problem is not the code
[18:09:29] <robertmaxrees> actually it is.
[18:09:31] <deadevilboy> is the way load is calling things
[18:09:33] <robertmaxrees> you're binding incorrectly.
[18:10:02] <deadevilboy> so correct me
[18:10:07] <deadevilboy> everyone says something
[18:10:14] <deadevilboy> but show me some code that works
[18:10:22] <deadevilboy> everyone seems to know the problem
[18:10:28] <deadevilboy> but no solution is pointed
[18:10:31] <deadevilboy> "bind"
[18:10:34] <robertmaxrees> we given you the solutin.
[18:10:41] <deadevilboy> then change the code
[18:10:45] <arc_> ...
[18:10:47] <deadevilboy> with something that works
[18:10:48] <robertmaxrees> but your code is so difficult to understand and unwind that it's hard to know what all to do.
[18:10:53] <deadevilboy> I wanna see your point then
[18:10:56] <deadevilboy> if it works
[18:10:56] <robertmaxrees> plus that's not the point of this channel.
[18:11:01] <robertmaxrees> we don't change your code - we help you fix it.
[18:11:06] <deadevilboy> yep
[18:11:22] <robertmaxrees> normally that means you break the problem down to its component parts.
[18:11:23] <deadevilboy> but is nice to say.. it is not correct... u need to bind bla bla
[18:11:29] <deadevilboy> but how, that is the principle
[18:11:40] <robertmaxrees> instead of linking an exitre copy of the page, replicate the issue.
[18:11:44] <robertmaxrees> standalone.
[18:11:46] <deadevilboy> look.. then explain me why it works with php include
[18:11:53] <deadevilboy> why then
[18:11:58] <robertmaxrees> because it's already in the page by the time it gets to the browser.
[18:12:00] <deadevilboy> if the code and the bindings are wrong
[18:12:05] <deadevilboy> why does it work with php include
[18:12:16] <robertmaxrees> the bindings are wrong if you're dynamically loading.
[18:12:20] <deadevilboy> so load is not equal to php include
[18:12:22] <robertmaxrees> no.
[18:12:23] <arc_> no
[18:12:24] <robertmaxrees> it's async.
[18:12:34] <robertmaxrees> uses ajax and dynamically injects into the page after it's loaded.
[18:12:44] <robertmaxrees> php includes happen before the page is sent ot the browser.
[18:13:10] <deadevilboy> but the length of the inserted ids are equal to one
[18:13:24] <deadevilboy> so they are already binded or how can I see  that?
[18:13:28] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[18:13:37] <deadevilboy> if the objects are loaded
[18:13:42] <deadevilboy> then I can use them
[18:13:56] <robertmaxrees> if you're using server-side includes, they exist on pageload.
[18:14:02] <robertmaxrees> if you're doing it with ajax, then they don't.
[18:14:09] <arc_> you cannot bind to an element that was added after the page loads
[18:14:19] <deadevilboy> alright arc
[18:14:23] <deadevilboy> that I understand
[18:14:24] <robertmaxrees> errr, you can, but it's smarter to use delegation.
[18:14:30] <deadevilboy> so there is no way to solve that?
[18:14:42] <arc_> https://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/
[18:14:46] <arc_> bind this way
[18:14:54] <robertmaxrees> deadevilboy you want to use event delegation if you'd like to capture events emitted from elements added after the page loads.
[18:16:01] <deadevilboy> hmm ok
[18:16:04] <deadevilboy> got it now
[18:16:06] <deadevilboy> reading
[18:16:09] <deadevilboy> best thing to do
[18:16:14] <deadevilboy> thanks
[18:16:28] <deadevilboy> but u pointed me in the right direction
[18:16:30] <deadevilboy> thanks
[18:17:05] <robertmaxrees> lol so the rule is link people to TWO places to read on the same subject :)
[18:17:59] <deadevilboy> yep.. cause the only thing you say is bind
[18:18:08] <deadevilboy> I don't know how to do it correctly for sure
[18:18:10] <deadevilboy> so I must read
[18:18:17] <deadevilboy> you don't correct code right? hahah
[18:18:18] <deadevilboy> :D
[18:18:21] <deadevilboy> kidding
[18:18:22] <deadevilboy> :-p
[18:22:28] <FilipNortic> deadevilboy: If you are that unsure you can try and bind to body util you get it working and move it up the line later
[18:22:59] <deadevilboy> until I get the trigger
[18:23:06] <deadevilboy> well.. it is better
[18:33:55] <deadevilboy> FilipNortic: almost done
[18:34:08] <deadevilboy> FilipNortic: I used body
[18:34:10] <deadevilboy> and it works
[18:34:18] <robertmaxrees> you should bind lower if you can.
[18:34:21] <robertmaxrees> but cool.
[18:34:25] <robertmaxrees> so it was a bad selector.
[18:34:37] <deadevilboy> no.. I used bind
[18:34:40] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[18:34:43] <robertmaxrees> you should use .on()
[18:34:49] <deadevilboy> yes
[18:34:52] <deadevilboy> that is what I did
[18:34:58] <deadevilboy> $('body').on('click', 'form', function() {
[18:35:07] <robertmaxrees> right, you want to bind lower than body if you can.
[18:35:15] <robertmaxrees> and you want to bind to the submit event.
[18:35:16] <deadevilboy> yes
[18:35:22] <deadevilboy> I will try the last parent div
[18:35:28] <deadevilboy> that embbeds the code
[18:36:20] <deadevilboy> but if u have imagine: parent div --> includes child div --> that includes child 2 div = child of the child in relation to parent
[18:36:36] <deadevilboy> I must include the parent of first loaded page right?
[18:36:41] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[18:36:41] <arc_> anything that existed when the page loads, and contains the elements you want to trigger the event
[18:36:45] <robertmaxrees> ^
[18:38:12] <FilipNortic> so basicly something created or included by your hp
[18:38:26] <robertmaxrees> "hp"?
[18:38:33] <deadevilboy> php he means
[18:38:44] <FilipNortic> yes php
[18:38:49] <deadevilboy> yep.. done
[18:38:55] <robertmaxrees> gotta stop thinking of it in terms of php fwiw - js doesn't care about where it came from.
[18:38:58] <robertmaxrees> it only sees the html.
[18:39:01] <deadevilboy> #conteudo  or content in translation is parent
[18:39:05] <deadevilboy> so np, it is working
[18:39:25] <deadevilboy> I will try with a child
[18:39:30] <deadevilboy> just to see the difference
[18:40:15] <deadevilboy> with child shouldn't work right?
[18:40:37] <robertmaxrees> does the child exist on pageload?
[18:41:02] <deadevilboy> no
[18:41:12] <deadevilboy> but there are 2 loads
[18:41:14] <robertmaxrees> then it likely won't work unless you're binding after it's added.
[18:41:23] <deadevilboy> one loads another.. the this last loads another
[18:41:28] <deadevilboy> if I use the intermediate
[18:41:29] <deadevilboy> it works
[18:41:31] <robertmaxrees> that is irrelevant.
[18:41:35] <robertmaxrees> then you're doing somethign weird.
[18:41:36] <deadevilboy> only the last child doesn't work
[18:41:44] <robertmaxrees> race conditions.
[18:42:02] <FilipNortic> ahh yeah that's not good
[18:42:11] <robertmaxrees> bind to the parent that exists on pageload.
[18:42:13] <robertmaxrees> you always want that.
[18:42:20] <deadevilboy> main php calls second php... that second includes a third (form)
[18:42:37] <deadevilboy> if I use parent div id or intermediate div id (second php), it will work
[18:42:38] <robertmaxrees> and that's done before or after it's sent to the browser?
[18:42:44] <deadevilboy> not if I use last child
[18:42:52] <robertmaxrees> php include and ajax are different.
[18:43:02] <deadevilboy> no, forget php include
[18:43:03] <robertmaxrees> so you have php that includes another php file, right?
[18:43:10] <deadevilboy> I am not doing it with php at the moment
[18:43:16] <deadevilboy> I already know it works with php
[18:43:20] <robertmaxrees> lol
[18:43:22] <deadevilboy> I wanna make it with load
[18:43:29] <robertmaxrees> right, which uses ajax.
[18:43:35] <deadevilboy> exactly
[18:43:46] <FilipNortic> well if you comment out all the js and check what you got in the page
[18:43:48] <deadevilboy> so if I use parent and intermediate #div
[18:43:54] <deadevilboy> the code is working
[18:43:56] <robertmaxrees> you always bind to the parent that exists on pagelaod.
[18:44:08] <deadevilboy> but the intermediate is not at the pageload
[18:44:08] <robertmaxrees> don't rely on anything getting loaded via ajax.
[18:44:15] <deadevilboy> so theoretically it shouldn't work
[18:44:16] <robertmaxrees> race conditions.
[18:44:24] <robertmaxrees> the binding might still happen after it exists.
[18:44:40] <deadevilboy> so u recommend to use the parent, always
[18:44:49] <deadevilboy> even if intermediate works
[18:44:53] <robertmaxrees> the parent that exists on pagelaod.
[18:45:00] <robertmaxrees> because otherwise you're relying on a race condition.
[18:45:04] <deadevilboy> ok.. in theory, only 1st php file
[18:45:07] <deadevilboy> ok
[18:45:10] <robertmaxrees> stop thinking in terms of php.
[18:45:11] <deadevilboy> understood
[18:45:15] <robertmaxrees> js doesn't care about the server-side.
[18:45:17] <robertmaxrees> it sees HTML
[18:45:23] <deadevilboy> ok, meaning the first file
[18:45:26] <deadevilboy> or page
[18:45:27] <robertmaxrees> or file.
[18:45:29] <FilipNortic> there is $.when to but that's for another time
[18:45:30] <deadevilboy> whatever
[18:45:37] <robertmaxrees> think in terms of "the document"
[18:45:45] <deadevilboy> ok.. right.. document
[18:45:49] <deadevilboy> like in javascript
[18:45:54] <deadevilboy> parent and child doc
[18:45:58] <robertmaxrees> deadevilboy you're IN javascript.
[18:46:01] <deadevilboy> I know
[18:46:05] <deadevilboy> jquery is js
[18:46:17] <robertmaxrees> it's not "like in javascript" :) that's my point.
[18:46:27] <deadevilboy> it was just to make it clear
[18:46:27] <robertmaxrees> FilipNortic even with deffereds you should leverage delegation.
[18:46:36] <deadevilboy> it is the ways terms are used
[18:46:39] <deadevilboy> correctly
[18:46:49] <robertmaxrees> deadevilboy which is why i'm correcting you :)
[18:46:55] <robertmaxrees> otherwise you'll get really confused later.
[18:47:56] <deadevilboy> yep...
[18:47:58] <deadevilboy> thks
[18:48:04] <deadevilboy> you see, it is race condition
[18:48:13] <deadevilboy> cause even until the last div that makes the form
[18:48:17] <deadevilboy> the code works
[18:48:25] <deadevilboy> it doesn't work if I call the form ID
[18:48:51] <deadevilboy> but if I call the last child div
[18:48:55] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[18:48:55] <deadevilboy> it works
[18:49:23] <FilipNortic> that's not what we meant by race conditions
[18:50:09] <FilipNortic> race conditions is when you have many ajax and need them to finnish in a certian order but doesn't ensure it
[18:50:53] <deadevilboy> ok
[18:50:55] <deadevilboy> understood
[18:50:57] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[18:50:59] <robertmaxrees> lol
[18:51:31] <FilipNortic> did i mess up formulation again?
[18:51:33] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[18:51:56] <robertmaxrees> race condition just means you have multiple things happening at once and you need them to happen in a particular order but aren't guaranteeing that.
[18:52:24] <FilipNortic> ok was trying to explain what it meant here
[18:52:55] <FilipNortic> I'm more of a dba then a frontend guy so I know race condtions all to well
[18:55:03] <deadevilboy_> sorry
[18:55:12] <deadevilboy_> connection reseted
[18:55:47] <FilipNortic> you didn't really miss anything of significans
[18:55:57] <robertmaxrees> just clarifying what "race condition" means.
[18:57:33] <FilipNortic> yeah ever so often I come across code were someone tried to fix it with timeOuts
[18:57:39] <robertmaxrees> ew
[18:58:13] <FilipNortic> not a road you want to take
[18:58:17] <robertmaxrees> ever
[19:02:38] <deadevilboy_> so, the event can be submit
[19:02:40] <deadevilboy_> right?
[19:02:41] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[19:04:09] <deadevilboy_> hmmm and then I have to submit it as a user click or it can be done programmatically
[19:04:17] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[19:04:19] <deadevilboy_> *with a user click
[19:04:22] <robertmaxrees> you care about the submit event.
[19:04:26] <robertmaxrees> you can trigger submit.
[19:04:48] <deadevilboy_> hmm
[19:04:51] <deadevilboy_> I see..
[19:04:54] <deadevilboy_> let me just do one thing
[19:04:56] <robertmaxrees> but why do you care about that click?
[19:05:09] <robertmaxrees> sounds like you need to abstract logic out into a function,.
[19:05:17] <deadevilboy_> exactly that
[19:05:18] <deadevilboy_> hehehe
[19:19:16] <sarmiena_> i’m using select2 & using ajax to load options when the user starts typing a search term. however, I don’t want to fire an initial ajax request until they start typing. can’t seem to find the answer in the documentation. any guidance?
[19:23:22] <robertmaxrees> why do you want to prevent the ajax until then?
[19:24:35] <ExtraSteve> I have no idea what the original question is, but 9 times out of 10 the answer to that question is "poor design"
[19:24:38] <ExtraSteve> Or "poor planning"
[19:24:53] * ExtraSteve now wants to know the original question
[19:25:31] <robertmaxrees> they want to prevent select2 from firing its initial ajax call until the user starts typ[ing.
[19:25:45] <ExtraSteve> huh
[19:29:38] <deadevilboy_> ExtraSteve: I guess we'll never know
[19:29:54] <robertmaxrees> wonder why they're ignoring us.
[19:30:01] <deadevilboy_> yep
[19:30:51] <ExtraSteve> alas
[19:30:53] <multi_io> how do you get the new dom node that oldnode.replaceWith(htmlstring) has created?
[19:31:14] <multi_io> the call returns oldnode
[19:31:46] <robertmaxrees> select it.
[19:34:44] <multi_io> robertmaxrees: how, if I don't know anything about it?
[19:34:46] <shoky> or:  var newnode = $(htmlstring); oldnode.replaceWith(newnode);
[19:35:12] <multi_io> shoky: yeah, thought of that too
[19:35:23] <multi_io> seems to be the only generic way

[20:24:09] <multi_io> when using jquery in a reusable library, would youe use jQuery() instead of $() ?
[20:24:28] <robertmaxrees> you'd use jQuery but never load it yourself.
[20:24:51] <robertmaxrees> wrap it in an iife and give yourself $ if you want it.
