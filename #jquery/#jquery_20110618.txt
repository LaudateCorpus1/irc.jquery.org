[00:01:32] <gnarf> alystair: can you give me a fiddle of what you're trying to do?
[00:01:36] <gnarf> I can do a little digging
[00:02:43] <alystair> well it's straight forward, I have one variable which is calculated right before the animation once and using that for baseline (no problems there)... then in every step I want to apply another variable against it (eg. increase in gravity)
[00:03:11] <gnarf> so the "endpoint" of your animation is changing?
[00:03:28] <alystair> pretty much
[00:03:36] <gnarf> can you fiddle the code you have?
[00:04:04] <alystair> although actually I could pretty much pre-calc every step into an array before an animation happens if that helps...
[00:04:09] <alystair> fiddle?
[00:04:14] <gnarf> ?p @alystair
[00:04:14] <bot-t> alystair, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js or http://fixee.org/
[00:04:25] <gnarf> alystair: you don't really want to calculate "steps"
[00:05:11] <gnarf> alystair: the only way I could think of doing it is animating non-standard property names and also tying into cssHooks
[00:05:27] <gnarf> like animate({ complexAnim: 1 })
[00:05:39] * coldhead shudders
[00:05:42] <gnarf> and let the setter for complexAnim do the calc/position
[00:05:53] <gnarf> but it just seems wrong
[00:06:02] <gnarf> i don't think phsycics falls into "animation"
[00:06:24] <kontain> coldhead: jS is wierd. does it not understand spaces?
[00:07:14] <jrockjiggz> js whitespace is irrelevant
[00:07:21] <gnarf> jrockjiggz: not true
[00:07:27] <mentaldevils> it depends
[00:07:33] <coldhead> mostly irrelevant
[00:07:38] <gnarf> jrockjiggz: newlines count as semicolons sometimes :)
[00:08:06] <jrockjiggz> gnarf: except newlines ;)
[00:08:39] <gnarf> alystair: you might end up having to write your own polling interval type of funcion that loops through its own array of "physical" elements
[00:08:50] <mentaldevils> kontain: specify
[00:08:59] <jrockjiggz> ?eq
[00:09:00] <bot-t> .eq(index): Reduce the set of matched elements to the one at the specified index. http://api.jquery.com/eq/
[00:09:24] <jrockjiggz> how do you replace a element with another?
[00:09:32] <gnarf> jrockjiggz: in a jQuery set?
[00:09:35] <jrockjiggz> yes
[00:09:36] <gnarf> jrockjiggz: or in the DOM
[00:09:39] <jrockjiggz> DPOM
[00:09:41] <jrockjiggz> DOM
[00:09:42] <gnarf> ?replaceWith
[00:09:43] <bot-t> .replaceWith(newContent): Replace each element in the set of matched elements with the provided new content. http://api.jquery.com/replaceWith/
[00:09:59] <jrockjiggz> let me try..
[00:10:00] <gnarf> ?replace
[00:10:02] <bot-t> gnarf, DOM Replacement - These methods are used to remove content from the DOM and replace it with new content. http://api.jquery.com/category/manipulation/dom-replacement/
[00:10:08] <jrockjiggz> there is no replace... =/
[00:10:10] <alystair> gnarf: http://jsfiddle.net/zcdKj/
[00:10:21] <gnarf> ?replaceAll
[00:10:22] <bot-t> .replaceAll(): Replace each target element with the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/replaceAll/
[00:10:29] <alystair> the closer to the bottom of the image you click it applies more 'force' to upward movement
[00:10:37] <gnarf> thats the opposite of replaceWith
[00:10:43] <jrockjiggz> $('#officialsDiv').find('select').eq(i).replaceWith(data);
[00:11:01] <gnarf> jrockjiggz: right
[00:11:02] <alystair> I want to apply a changing variable against it in each frame basically that applies a downwards force (+Y) in a semi-newtonian way, very simple
[00:11:58] <kontain> please don't talk about newtonian crap here
[00:12:03] <gnarf> alystair: do your own smoothing in a polling loop
[00:12:11] <gnarf> alystair: probably easiest
[00:12:17] <dr0id> coldhead: lsthemes is back
[00:12:23] <kontain> that newtonian crap was pain in the ass on my finals.
[00:12:24] <dr0id> who knows ruby here ?
[00:12:24] <mentaldevils> kontain: why not?
[00:12:47] <coldhead> guh
[00:13:02] <kontain> mentaldevils: that newtonian crap was pain in the ass on my finals.
[00:13:02] <alystair> gnarf: so you recommend not using the .animate function at all?
[00:13:12] <alystair> I could just cheat and use CSS3 stuff :/
[00:13:18] <gnarf> alystair: not even css3 stuff
[00:13:27] <gnarf> alystair: you should calculate each frame
[00:13:52] <alystair> I can do that pretty easily
[00:14:22] <kontain> coldhead: are you jS guru or something?
[00:14:38] <coldhead> certainly not
[00:14:47] <alystair> gnarf: pretty straight forward, then what, just throw it into a loop... or toss each one into .animate so they all queue up?
[00:14:56] <mentaldevils> dr0id:
[00:15:03] <mentaldevils> did you try #ruby
[00:15:55] <dr0id> yeah, quite dead :P I know its quite offtopic, so will take the convo to PM if someone is interested to help, heh
[00:17:37] <mentaldevils> you gotta be patient, descriptive, and nice too
[00:17:55] <mentaldevils> what is your ?
[00:18:29] <jrockjiggz> a bit abstract question.. but... $(this).index(),  how will jquery find the index() position? is it assumed in reference to the parent?
[00:18:49] <kontain> coldhead: http://kamranmotors.com/Core/#Contact
[00:19:01] <kontain> coldhead: Now, click on 'Audi' option to the lef.t
[00:19:20] <coldhead> do i HAVE to?
[00:19:26] <coldhead> i've lost my vitality
[00:19:35] <kontain> coldhead: Pleaes, I beg you.
[00:20:04] <coldhead> ew don't do that
[00:20:58] <coldhead> i clicked
[00:21:01] <coldhead> now what
[00:22:16] <jrockjiggz> -.-
[00:22:41] <coldhead> how rude
[00:22:54] <hrwath> YOU'VE WON THE AUDI AS 999,999TH CLICKER!
[00:23:15] <jrockjiggz> why am i getting index as 0,2,4,6... when my selection is returning the correct elements
[00:24:39] <kontain> coldhead: sorry, I got carred away. I was eatting an apple.
[00:24:47] <coldhead> omg
[00:24:49] <coldhead> ?csb
[00:24:49] <bot-t> cool story, bro. http://i599.photobucket.com/albums/tt71/Pittsburghistan/xb9yt0jpg-1.gif
[00:24:50] <kontain> coldhead: Do you see the thumbnail popping in the bottom?
[00:24:55] <jrockjiggz> nm...
[00:25:10] <kontain> coldhead: I don't want that. I want it to 'go' to that 'Audi' page.
[00:25:49] <hrwath> kontain, you ate whole Apple? What about Jobs?
[00:26:11] <jrockjiggz> $(this).index() is not limiting to the element type, but is including all the children in the match set
[00:26:55] <jrockjiggz> $('.class').click( function(){ $(this).index(); }); //is giving me the index based on children order..  -- how can i limit this to be only of specific element type?
[00:27:37] <coldhead> kontain: i think the code that is meant to handle this needs to be wrapped in $(document).ready()
[00:27:44] <coldhead> basically WRAP EVERYTHING IN THAT
[00:27:52] <coldhead> use as many as you need
[00:31:24] <mayersd> anyone know of a good jquery tree plugin ?
[00:38:19] <SuperRoach> Evening jQueriers :P  I'd like to know, is there an preset for making an element have a bouncing effect? where it scales larger, then returns to its normal size.
[00:42:17] <innociv> toggle or animate.  jquery ui has extra animation effects.
[00:46:07] <coldhead> ?html @ kontain
[00:46:08] <bot-t> kontain, .html(): Get the HTML contents of the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/html/
[00:46:54] <magcius> is there an easy way to detect if a selector exists?
[00:47:09] <magcius> for instance, does elem.find('.class-name') contain any matched elements?
[00:47:43] <magcius> something like elem.find('.class-name').is_empty or elem.hasChild('.class-name')
[00:48:17] <coldhead> elem.find('.foo').length
[00:48:21] <coldhead> test if that is > 0
[00:48:31] <magcius> coldhead, elem.find returns a list?
[00:48:38] <magcius> I thought it returned this magical jQuery object
[00:48:41] <coldhead> it returns a jQuery object
[00:48:44] <coldhead> which has a length
[00:48:49] <magcius> oh
[00:48:50] <coldhead> magic <3
[00:50:03] <innociv> if( $(selector)[0] ) is more concise and easier to see at a glance imo
[00:50:34] <magcius> innociv, really?
[00:50:37] <innociv> elem.find('.foo')[0] same thing.  It'll return false basically
[00:50:41] <magcius> also, is $(selector, elem) or elem.find(selector)
[00:50:42] <innociv> Yes, because [0] doesn't exist.
[00:50:45] <innociv> selector is an array
[00:50:51] <magcius> Oh, I understand how it works.
[00:50:57] <innociv> if there is no 0th element the selector is empty
[00:51:03] <magcius> Right, I understand JS
[00:51:21] <systemfault> Being explicit isn't a bad thing.. IMHO.
[00:51:24] <magcius> but I don't care about any element in particular, just that there are some (otherwise, I need to fetch it from AJAX)
[00:51:42] <innociv> .length is getting array length, but just if( $(selector)[0] ) is a lot more concise than if( $(selector).length > 0 )
[00:51:51] <magcius> "selector is an array"
[00:51:54] <magcius> so it's not a jQuery object?
[00:52:12] <innociv> it's an array of objects
[00:52:39] <innociv> I think [0] is more explicit.. I mean it's the same thing, but at a glance its a lot easier to see the [0] for me than .length > 0
[00:52:44] <innociv> Just stands out more.
[00:52:48] <innociv> Same thing, though.
[00:52:58] <jrockjiggz> innociv: the jQuery friendly way is to actually use .eq()
[00:53:08] <magcius> ...
[00:53:12] <jrockjiggz> $('el').eq(0)
[00:53:23] <jrockjiggz> because [0] sometimes conflicts with other functions
[00:53:26] <magcius> first, $('.foo', elem) or elem.find('.foo')
[00:53:36] <innociv> wrong, jrockjiggz
[00:53:38] <magcius> jrockjiggz, eq() seems like a terrible name for that function
[00:53:45] <magcius> erll
[00:53:51] <innociv> $(select).eq(0) unmatched returns []
[00:53:55] <innociv> Not undefined
[00:53:58] <magcius> I could do $(selector).hasOwnProperty(0) :)
[00:53:59] <systemfault> A few jQuery functions have ugly names...
[00:54:04] <systemfault> That's life :/
[00:54:14] <gnarf> alystair: http://jsfiddle.net/gnarf/m8mmm/ a really really crude example of what i was talking about
[00:54:16] <innociv> so if ( $('.something-that-doesnt-exist').eq(0) ) will essentially return true
[00:54:21] <magcius> systemfault, no, it's just that I'd expect eq() to be 'equals'
[00:54:28] <magcius> not 'contains'
[00:54:38] <innociv> .eq() means index.  It's the same as the css selector :eq()
[00:54:40] <innociv> it's a good name
[00:54:40] <gnarf> innociv: it returns $([ undefined ])
[00:54:40] <systemfault> magcius: Why do you say no then?
[00:55:07] <gnarf> innociv: and all objects are "truish"
[00:55:12] <magcius> gnarf, Boolean([ undefined ]) is true
[00:55:18] <magcius> (or !![undefined])
[00:55:32] <innociv> .eval if( $('.wot').eq() ) console.log('true')
[00:55:37] <innociv> Anyways, it returns true.
[00:55:38] <gnarf> innociv: .get(0)
[00:55:43] <gnarf> or just
[00:55:47] <magcius> wow
[00:55:51] <gnarf> if (whatever.length) { has an element }
[00:55:54] <innociv> yeah .get(0) will work
[00:55:56] <magcius> right
[00:56:03] <innociv> But imo [0] just stands out when you're glancing over code
[00:56:11] <magcius> can somebody answer my questions :)
[00:56:15] <gnarf> [0] == .get(0)
[00:56:19] <innociv> What was the question?
[00:56:20] <systemfault> magcius: What question?
[00:56:38] <magcius> which is preferred: $(selector, elem) or elem.find(selector)
[00:56:43] <gnarf> magcius: elem.find( selector ) is shorter by a few operations / function calls than $( selector, context )
[00:57:04] <gnarf> the latter only makes sense in string contexts
[00:57:09] <gnarf> or dom element contexts
[00:57:17] <gnarf> jquery contexts should always use .find
[00:57:18] <magcius> OK.
[00:57:29] <magcius> also, does .find() (or the $() equivalent) return an array or a jQuery object?
[00:57:37] <gnarf> the latter returns $( context ).find( selector )
[00:57:42] <gnarf> magcius: always jquery
[00:57:50] <gnarf> magcius: until you .get() for a bare array
[00:57:52] <innociv> I prefer to use elem.find() for sure.  At the very least because it's easier to understand when you read back to it
[00:57:55] <magcius> OK.
[00:58:25] <gnarf> magcius: which only really makes any sense if you .map() it first, you rarely need an array of dom elements for anything :)
[00:58:26] <innociv> All the functions return jquery. [#] does not, that'll get the bare element or something.  I'm not sure exactly.
[00:59:06] <gnarf> magcius: but yeah, all traversal functions return jQuery
[00:59:22] <innociv> All jquery traversal functions I meant, yeah.
[00:59:30] <innociv> As would make sense.
[00:59:32] <gnarf> most other functions return the "current" jQuery to allow 'chains'
[00:59:45] <gnarf> some notable exceptions, all documented
[01:02:38] <magcius> can anyone help me go over https://github.com/magcius/sweettooth/blob/master/sweettooth/static/sweettooth.js to see if it follows best practices?
[01:02:43] <magcius> I'm new to jQuery
[01:04:19] <gnarf> magcius: as of jQuery 1.5 you can return $.ajax to allow adding .success / .error later
[01:04:31] <magcius> gnarf, neato.
[01:04:34] * magcius fixes
[01:04:37] <magcius> er
[01:04:51] <gnarf> just a neat trick
[01:04:55] <magcius> I meant to post https://github.com/magcius/sweettooth/blob/pound-jquery-review/sweettooth/static/sweettooth.js
[01:06:01] <gnarf> magcius: aside from code style, it seems pretty straightforward
[01:06:14] <magcius> gnarf, nitpicks about code style?
[01:06:41] <magcius> I'm most concerned about all the 'config' hackery
[01:06:50] <magcius> There has to be a better way to do some of this stuff :)
[01:07:01] <magcius> the states/handlers seems a bit hacky to me too
[01:07:28] <gnarf> magcius: well over time with javascript languages in general you'll obviously find better tools for some of those processes
[01:07:32] <gnarf> and learn to dry it up a bit more
[01:07:53] <gnarf> magcius: http://docs.jquery.com/JQuery_Core_Style_Guidelines -- not that you need to follow them for your own project
[01:07:54] <magcius> I'm asking now for any vague comments about how not to do stuff :)
[01:08:17] <gnarf> magcius: also, I personally only try to use one "var" per function
[01:08:28] <magcius> var a, b, c, d;?
[01:08:31] <gnarf> meaning var a=1, b=2, c=3;
[01:08:32] <gnarf> yeah
[01:08:34] * magcius wishes he had mozilla-type "let"
[01:08:47] <systemfault> crockford-style var declarations :P
[01:09:00] <systemfault> I would also love "let" :/
[01:09:06] <gnarf> i think its a solid piece of advice
[01:09:17] <magcius> is there anything bad about using more than one 'var'?
[01:09:20] <gnarf> since all var delclarations are hoisted anyway
[01:09:34] <gnarf> magcius: depends on the minifier you use ;)
[01:09:53] <gnarf> "var " can't be compressed out in some situations, but a lot of them are smart enough to do it anyway
[01:10:06] <magcius> gnarf, so, $.ajax( ... ).callback(foo).errback(bar); ?
[01:10:21] <gnarf> magcius: .done( foo ).fail( bar )
[01:10:22] <gnarf> yeah
[01:10:30] <magcius> er, I'm used to Twisted.
[01:10:43] <gnarf> there is also .success and .error, but they are just aliases for .done and .fail
[01:10:43] <magcius> not .success and .error?
[01:10:46] <gnarf> use .done and .fail
[01:10:48] <magcius> OK.
[01:10:54] <gnarf> thats the direction moving forward
[01:12:53] <magcius> is there an easier way to do the .removeClass.addClass.addClass juggling I'm doing?
[01:13:07] <magcius> I basically want class="button $state"

[01:54:00] <SirBT> Hi anyone really good with JQuery here?
[01:54:48] <SirBT> I need someone who is an expert in JQuery anyone up for the challenge?
[01:54:54] <schu> SirBT: what about asking your question and waiting for the answers? ;)
[01:55:37] <SirBT> ok then
[01:57:38] <Woet> SirBT: what about asking your question and waiting for the answers?
[01:57:50] <SirBT> why does function Org_AddATeachers()  {   //$.get( url, {name:"John",id:"100"}, function(data){ $("address").html( data ); alert("Ajax call complete.");}).   	$.get("addATeacherInsert.php",  		{tFirstName: $("#teachers_first_name").attr("value"),  		tLastName: $("#teachers_surname").attr("value")},  		function(returnData) 			{ 			$("#Ajax_response").html(returnData); 			}); 		 }
[01:58:04] <Woet> ?paste
[01:58:05] <bot-t> Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js or http://fixee.org/
[01:58:13] <SirBT> ok
[02:02:23] <SirBT> Ok how does: http://paste.pocoo.org/+js
[02:02:26] <SirBT> work
[02:02:41] <SirBT> I want to invite someone to look at the code there?
[02:04:44] <coldhead> copy paste the link from the browser
[02:04:50] <coldhead> once you have saved the code
[02:05:00] <SirBT> ok
[02:05:49] <SirBT> http://paste.pocoo.org/show/414166/
[02:06:04] <SirBT> can you have a look coldhead?
[02:07:23] <coldhead> sure i can
[02:07:26] <SirBT> the code only works when Ive added the alert function at the end of the function
[02:07:33] <SirBT> if I remove it it stops working
[02:08:11] <SirBT> Also it will only work in Firefox and not in Chrome, which I find strange
[02:08:35] <SirBT> I really dont know what I am doing wrong?
[02:10:06] <coldhead> http://paste.pocoo.org/compare/414168/414166/
[02:10:21] <coldhead> you haven't shown how you are calling that function
[02:10:29] <coldhead> but i suspect it needs a return false
[02:10:38] <coldhead> i also changed attr to val
[02:10:41] <coldhead> because it's neater
[02:10:56] <coldhead> if that doesn't work paste the form and the actual call
[02:10:58] <coldhead> good luck
[02:12:11] <SirBT> let me try that...
[02:12:28] <SirBT> @coldhead have you got skype
[02:12:46] <coldhead> no
[02:12:57] <coldhead> my parents won't let me use skype
[02:13:00] <coldhead> because of paedophiles
[02:13:57] <SirBT> I see I never new you where young
[02:14:49] <coldhead> i don't like to talk about it
[02:14:52] <coldhead> because of paedophiles
[02:15:02] <SirBT> I  understand
[02:18:52] <schu> SirBT: maybe checking your code with jslint.com may provide further insights
[02:19:38] <SirBT> thank you schu
[02:19:56] <SirBT> I really need someone who I can share screen with though
[02:20:17] <schu> SirBT: yw - do you use firebug to get the debug output of your ajax call?
[02:20:44] <SirBT> @coldhead.. the changes didnt make any difference will post up what you requires soon
[02:22:52] <coldhead> my changes made some difference
[02:22:57] <coldhead> they made you a better person
[02:23:49] <SirBT> @schu strangly enough it works well when I step throught the code in firebug but not in run time
[02:23:58] <SirBT> @coldhead LOL your funny
[02:24:02] <SirBT> thanks though
[02:24:30] <schu> coldhead++
[02:26:46] <schu> SirBT: doing some guesswork here but i think maybe the "../" in the url may give you trouble - try (for testing purposes) to enter the full path there and switch from using $.ajax to $.get (at least for testing), may help too
[02:37:23] <DylanGordon> how do i get the scroll bars position?
[02:37:30] <JoeCoolDesk> How do you get a div to pop up with different text inside it inside of your sliders?
[02:41:35] <Charizard7> How do you find out what the scrollbars position is?
[02:43:53] <jayflux2> .scrollLeft() Charizard7
[02:44:00] <jayflux2> or .scrollTop()
[02:44:14] <Charizard7> thanks :D
[02:45:40] <JoeCoolDesk> Actually, would it be better to use the same div and switch out the innerHTML or use different divs and switch out their transparency?
[02:48:07] <Charizard7> where can i find the latest release notes, a script of mine doesnt seem to work with the latest version (1.6.1) of jquery, yet works with 1.5.2
[02:51:19] <Woet> Charizard7: http://webscripts.softpedia.com/scriptViewChangelog/jQuery-Javascript-Library-Changelog-39111.html
[02:52:16] <Charizard7> thanks, found something on jquerys blog mentioning the .attr() method which i think is my problem
[02:53:55] <innociv> How do I have a function be global?
[02:54:13] <innociv> I thought it was just declaring like function myFunction(arg) { }
[02:57:25] <Charizard7> fixed it, i had to change from using .attr() to using .prop()
[02:57:45] <coldhead> innociv: that won't work if you're declaring them inside another function
[02:58:01] <coldhead> window.myFunction = function (arg) {} will work though
[02:58:22] <innociv> So that won't work declaring within dom ready.
[02:58:32] <alystair> how do I prevent highlighting/double-click selects?
[02:58:48] <alystair> drag etc
[02:59:25] <innociv> It's different on each browser I believe.  There's a plugin for it
[02:59:38] <alystair> innociv: under what name?
[03:00:35] <innociv> I don't remember
[03:00:39] <alystair> kk thx
[03:00:46] <JoeCoolDesk> I mean as in fading out one text for another.
[03:18:47] <mipo> hi
[03:18:53] <JoeCoolDesk> Mipo
[03:19:14] <mipo> JoeCoolDesk , how are you?
[03:19:28] <JoeCoolDesk> I don't know
[03:19:35] <JoeCoolDesk> Why do I only get motivated when I get tired?
[03:20:07] <dr0id> because
[03:20:15] <JoeCoolDesk> I'm up for 12 hours and think, "alright, time to get some work done" and then I'm tired in another couple hours and can't get anything decent done.
[03:20:53] <mipo> JoeCoolDesk ?
[03:20:56] <mipo> how to fetch data without any timer?
[03:21:04] <SirBT> @schu are you still there?
[03:21:08] <JoeCoolDesk> Websockets?
[03:21:22] <shaggy_> How come there's like a "cache" on when you load a jquery ui dialog through .load
[03:22:01] <mipo> JoeCoolDesk , yes! or send data with ajax !
[03:22:11] <mipo> But without ant timer!
[03:22:17] <JoeCoolDesk> Phillipines or India?
[03:23:05] <shaggy_> Load Dialog [From URL, "first layer"] --> Click --> Open Second Dialog [Constructed from URL, "Second layer"] ===> CLOSE. Start again. ---> First layer changes, Second layer stays the same
[03:23:34] <mipo> JoeCoolDesk . you are with me?
[03:23:48] <JoeCoolDesk> Where are you from, sir?
[03:24:03] <mipo> JoeCoolDesk , I am from Iran
[03:27:21] <mipo> how to fetch data without any timer?
[03:27:47] <JoeCoolDesk> Recursive function?
[03:28:10] <JoeCoolDesk> Why can't you use a timer?
[03:28:18] <JoeCoolDesk> Some sort of homework question?
[03:28:21] <davidhong> why do you need timer to fetch data?
[03:28:40] <mipo> similar facebook! when you send me a message I want to see that without any clicking on a button!
[03:29:00] <JoeCoolDesk> Never used facebook
[03:29:16] <JoeCoolDesk> You mean like when you press enter?
[03:29:41] <mipo> yes , but I dont want to press enter
[03:29:55] <JoeCoolDesk> Auto fetch or auto submit?
[03:30:26] <mipo> auto fetch
[03:30:30] <mipo> and auto submit
[03:30:37] <JoeCoolDesk> When?
[03:31:54] <mipo> automatic get new message
[03:31:56] <mipo> similar
[03:32:06] <progrock> OT, but anyone know why when I conenct to my router via serial the text is all garbled with weird characters
[03:32:17] <davidhong> try socket.io ?
[03:32:55] <JoeCoolDesk> progrock, encoding
[03:35:36] <mipo> Similar this sample! I am message page!
[03:36:01] <mipo> I want to fetch new data without ant clicking!!!
[03:36:10] <mipo> similar chatroom!
[03:36:24] <schu> SirBT: yep, was just afk for a second
[03:36:49] <JoeCoolDesk> Sockets, timer or long-latency recursive ajax
[03:37:11] <davidhong> socket.io does it
[03:37:17] <mipo> first socket
[03:37:27] <alystair> ok silly question, is there a script or plugin out there that makes everything on page absolute positioned?
[03:37:32] <davidhong> if you want to implement your own, see the transports socket.io uses
[03:37:39] <davidhong> it has several fallbacks
[03:38:09] <mipo> and without timer!
[03:38:11] <mipo> how?
[03:39:31] <innociv> forum.init.self = ['foo','bar']; window.get_user = function(){ return forum.init.self; }  get_user() returns the actual function text...  I'd expect it to return the array.
[03:40:15] <mipo> innociv , this is for me?
[03:41:01] <innociv> Maybe you should read it.  Does't seem remotely close.
[03:43:01] <ohboy> t
[03:43:01] <mipo> what is init.self?
[03:43:32] <JoeCoolDesk> Hey mipo
[03:43:39] <mipo> yes
[03:43:49] <JoeCoolDesk> What are you working on?  You have a client or is it personal?
[03:44:08] <innociv> oh needed ()
[03:45:09] <mipo> I have admin part , but I want to load new message atumaticaly!
[03:45:54] <JoeCoolDesk> Why don't you hire someone that knows what they're doing?
[03:48:03] <innociv> Doesn't socket.io not work behind some firewalls?
[03:48:21] <mipo> innociv , how yo download that?
[03:48:26] <innociv> ...
[03:48:31] <innociv> I'm not telling you anything.
[03:48:37] <innociv> You don't even know how to use google.
[03:48:39] <mipo> JoeCoolDesk , I want to fetch automatically!
[03:48:45] <innociv> You want to be spoon fed.
[03:48:48] <JoeCoolDesk> Alright
[03:49:08] <mipo> innociv : :((
[03:57:40] <schu> does anyone know how to make cck fields show up next to one another (if that is possible without using css) in the edit form (e.g. on a user profile form) rather than underneath?
[03:58:30] <schu> sorry, wrong tab :-S
[03:59:42] <coldhead> juha___: i've wanted to go to a finnish demo party since i was 13. have fun you lucky mofo
[04:00:00] <JoeCoolDesk> Cock fields?
[04:00:32] <coldhead> >: |
[04:00:42] <schu> JoeCoolDesk: content creation kit (drupal) - posted to the wrong channel :P
[04:01:04] <coldhead> bye bye greasy
[04:10:09] <juha___> coldhead: i will!
[04:10:40] <juha___> coldhead: this is actually my first, and seems to be first for some of the people in this table also
[04:11:32] <coldhead> better late than never!
[04:13:06] <Shapeshifter> Here's something I don't understand. I have a div somwhere with id="i1_d_JPG". But if I do $("#i1_d_JPG") I get null. http://login.icu.uzh.ch/~archer/jq1.png I don't have the problem for all the other IDs in that screenshot. Another, possibly related question: how can I best find duplicate id tags?
[04:14:06] <juha___> coldhead: it took me 26 years to get rid of my demoparty virginity, will it now take another 26 years to get rid of ther other virginity?
[04:16:04] <Haprog> :D
[04:16:56] <Haprog> I've been to Assembly every summer since 2005, and going this year also.
[04:17:15] <mayersd> Shapeshifter: find/replace on your editor ?
[04:17:23] <Haprog> mainly because of demo stuff although it's a lot more than that.
[04:17:53] <Haprog> Would like to go to Altparty also at some point
[04:21:37] <Dev0n> hey, any know of a good tab effect plugin ?
[04:22:26] <innociv> jquery ui, and animate on the change event?..
[04:23:39] <Dev0n> um
[04:23:40] <Dev0n> hum
[04:23:57] <Dev0n> not too sure about jqueryui stuff tbh
[04:24:29] <Dev0n> I seem to find 3rd party stuff to look better and easier to intergrate
[04:31:29] <JakeyChan> hi
[04:43:43] <Charizard7> how do i get the documents scrollbar height?
[04:44:36] <Shapeshifter> I have a static html site which also has some kind of login form with action="noscript_authenticate". Now if the client enables js, jquery takes over and does stuff, and for example I do $("#login_button").click( function(e) { somewhere to replace that default noscript_authenticate procedure. It works but it seems like this default still gets fired. How can I disable the regular form action?
[04:45:05] <skylamer`> e.preventDefault();
[04:48:17] <kerozane> noob q. how can I construct a chain such that .append() creates a child of a new element created by a previous .append()? I tried .append($('<div>')).first().append($('<p>')) but the context doesn't change..
[04:48:32] <Shapeshifter> skylamer`: mhhh. doesn't seem to work. But it's odd anyway, I have to investigate.
[04:54:18] <kerozane> or put another way, what's the best way to construct a complex dom tree with event handlers etc..
[04:56:25] <Shapeshifter> kerozane: construct the dom tree in a templating language, use jquery only to add js actions?
[04:56:46] <kerozane> a client-side templating language?
[04:56:58] <Shapeshifter> kerozane: was thinking server side. but I understand what you mean.
[04:57:23] <kerozane> maybe 'complex' was overstating
[05:02:22] <Shapeshifter> kerozane: isn't what you want simply .append($('<div>').append$('<p>'))
[05:02:29] <alexidoia> I would like to test if I have an element which id is 'trux' in my document, so I do if( $('#trux')==undefined ) but that does not work as expected
[05:02:33] <alexidoia> any suggestino
[05:02:36] <alexidoia> any suggestion
[05:03:06] <Shapeshifter> alexidoia: afaik, selecting for a nonexistent id will return null, not undefined
[05:03:17] <kerozane> Shapeshifter: iirc that just creates div + p, not div > p
[05:05:03] <alexidoia> this always return the first statement wheter or not #header exists
[05:05:05] <alexidoia> if( $('#header')==undefined) alert('dont exist');
[05:05:05] <alexidoia> 	else alert('exist');
[05:05:34] <alexidoia> the second statement actualy
[05:06:09] <kerozane> Shapeshifter: no you're right. that nesting works. thanks :)
[05:06:20] <dabear> alexidoia: $ returns a jquery object. a jquery object is never undefined or false
[05:06:29] <dabear> $("adfdsfsdf").length
[05:06:33] <dabear> use that
[05:06:38] <alexidoia> ok
[05:07:29] <alexidoia> dabear: super
[05:19:12] <macheleon> is there a lightweight lighbox plugin similar to fancybox that offers multiple levels of lightboxing?
[05:19:25] <macheleon> I can't find it in fancybox
[05:23:27] <dabear> let me put a lightbox in your lightbox so you can box while you box
[05:23:45] <innociv> Lolllllll
[05:26:56] <b-> dabear: lol
[05:31:08] <macheleon> yo dawg
[05:32:26] <macheleon> floatbox does it, but costs .. surely there are others
[05:33:05] <b-> paying money for things on the interwebs!?
[05:43:20] <macheleon> exactly
[05:43:27] <macheleon> so, surely there are others
[05:45:35] <JakeyChan> how to select the child of clicked element, not the child of child
[05:46:10] <JakeyChan> $(menu).find('> li') ?
[06:15:05] <Shapeshifter> if I have one object fadeOut() and another fadeIn(), how can I time this correctly? As in, the first one needs to fade out and only then, the second should fade in?
[06:17:49] <Shapeshifter> mh. fadeOut takes an argument, so nevermind.
[06:46:10] <innociv> How do I see if an object isn't just {}(isn't just empty)?
[06:49:37] <Zucca> So... jQuery removes added script elements as soon as contents of that script is read (because some bug in IE). Is there a way to run a function after this script element is read?
[06:50:46] <Zucca> I'd use ajax, but my project requires that the pages where the code is can be run locally (without web server).
[06:58:36] <snoy_ms> Hey there. I bind 'mouseenter' and 'mouseleave' on an element. Within the called functions i do some animation and i hide()/show() another element. The problem is, it seems that the animation is pushed on a queue but the hide() method not. If i test the mouseenter and mouseout X times (realy fast), the animation runs some time and stops correct. The hide()/show() methods stops sometimes wrong. I am new to the queue stuff, but could that be the
[06:58:36] <snoy_ms> problem?
[07:02:30] <MoTiOnXml> is there a jQuery method to check if an object is a string?
[07:02:54] <RikudoSennin> hey guys, I have a list of 10 images, each is a 100x100px given.
[07:03:16] <RikudoSennin> the list is inside a relatively positioned div that's 500x500px
[07:03:43] <RikudoSennin> the point is to RANDOMALLY position the images inside, while the overlapping of images doesn't go over 10px each
[07:03:59] <RikudoSennin> doable? any plugin that does that maybe? :P
[07:18:56] <CoolCoder> multi select box add remove. while adding to another box its not gettng the value "selected". for this reason its not getting the post data in php. any idea?  here is the code http://pastebin.com/yHmsEvSS
[07:23:07] <Zucca> RikudoSennin: Create an array of those images with key as a number and value as the URL of an image. Then either shuffle the array and go trough it in a loop or go trough the array in random order,
[07:23:50] <Zucca> Oh...
[07:24:01] <Zucca> The images don't actually have "slots"?
[07:24:55] <snoy_ms> I have a problem with this jquery part http://pastebin.com/5PduBitz . If i do realy fast x times a mousenter and mousleave the animation runs perfekt, but the hide() function stops after some time.
[07:25:05] <Zucca> But those are rather "trown" on the table but none shall overlap each other and have 10px padding?
[07:25:16] <snoy_ms> anyone an idea, how to avoid this?
[07:26:30] <Jayflux> snoy_ms put it in www.jsfiddle.net so we can see it run
[07:27:59] <MoTiOnXml> anybody know if jquery-tools (from flowplayer) is supporting jquery 1.6.1?
[07:28:28] <macheleon> is there a lightbox plugin similar to fancybox that offers multiple levels of lightboxing? ie. click a link within a lightbox and it pops a secondary one
[07:28:45] <macheleon> *free ... floatbox does it
[07:33:21] <Guest18785> say for example i am doing a simple ajax request to get some html. it returns a string of html. how can i search to find a specific id inside of that string of html
[07:33:46] <Guest18785> for example
[07:33:52] <Zucca> RikudoSennin: If you find a jQuery plugin for that, please /msg me about it. :)
[07:33:59] <Zucca> g2g --->
[07:35:03] <Guest18785> $.ajax({ url: 'foo.html',  dataType: "html", success: function(data){ <!-- somehow i want to find the id #mainContainer in the html returned -->} });
[07:35:19] <Guest18785> any ideas?
[07:35:27] <CoolCoder> why multiple select box on click attr not changing to selected on html? how to change its html value to selected?
[07:37:11] <Guest18785> $.ajax({ url: 'foo.html',  dataType: "html", success: function(data){ <!-- somehow i want to find the id #mainContainer in the html returned -->} });
[07:38:06] <snoy_ms> Jayflux: http://jsfiddle.net/xjayJ/
[07:38:30] <snoy_ms> Jayflux: i tried to reproduce it in this small sandbox
[07:39:15] <snoy_ms> Jayflux: if you hover the blue element. the text and picture gets hide or shown. If you do it realy fast the text always works. The picture hangs up
[07:39:35] <schu> CoolCoder: iirc the attr "selected" is on the option, not the select itself
[07:39:37] <snoy_ms> maybe 10 times mousenter and leave
[07:41:19] <snoy_ms> I don't get if this is a nomal sideeffekt or a bug
[07:41:53] <CoolCoder> but still its not working schu: wait i will bin the code
[07:43:09] <DefV> g/26
[07:43:27] <CoolCoder> schu : http://pastebin.com/anDS0cKQ please check this
[07:43:50] <CoolCoder> here not getting the post values for second select box. its adding
[07:45:31] <snoy_ms> can anyone help me with this? http://jsfiddle.net/xjayJ/
[07:48:57] <schu> CoolCoder: hmmm... for me, the whole !$(...) construct with remove() and appendTo() chained to it looks a bit error prone. if i get it right, you want to have all the options generated from the php array and once i select them (even multiple ones) they are added to the empty box, right?
[07:50:04] <CoolCoder> yes. on the other box (seethis more clear http://jsfiddle.net/u5AU9/) its adding the elements of firstbox. but while posting on php we are not getting the elements. even if they are selection.
[07:50:13] <CoolCoder> any idea about how to fix?
[07:51:52] <schu> CoolCoder: wait a sec, i check on that
[07:52:20] <ryanneufeld> CoolCoder: you need to set the name of your select
[07:52:22] <ryanneufeld> to be an array
[07:52:22] <CoolCoder> wait. dear. fixed. its because name is not enclosed in [] check the name
[07:52:47] <CoolCoder> <select name="adv_education_source" id="adv_education_source" should be  this <select name="adv_education_source[]" id="adv_education_source"
[07:53:09] <CoolCoder> thanks ryanneufeld:  schu:
[07:53:38] <ryanneufeld> CoolCoder: what are you returning !$() that just seems strange
[07:54:08] <CoolCoder> ryanneufeld: its ok. working. dont know how it worked!! got code for some reference
[07:54:47] <ryanneufeld> CoolCoder: you should find out what it's returning there, could give you a hint as to what's going on
[07:54:57] <schu> CoolCoder: ok alright
[07:55:01] <ryanneufeld> oh, I see what's happening
[07:55:33] <ryanneufeld> CoolCoder: syntactically it's fine, but it's clear what it's doing
[07:56:23] <ryanneufeld> CoolCoder: since a jQuery object is a truthy value, so returning it with the ! causes it it to return false every time
[07:56:40] <CoolCoder> I am trying to add the list from one multiple select box to another. and the click function s for add button. on click on add, it will move the selected elements from one select box to another.
[07:57:36] <ryanneufeld> yeah, I can see that
[07:59:11] <ryanneufeld> CoolCoder: not sure where you got your code from, but it's not clear what's going on here for you…. is it?
[08:00:00] <ryanneufeld> CoolCoder: Also the fiddle wasn't working because you didn't enable jquery
[08:00:00] <ryanneufeld> http://jsfiddle.net/ryanneufeld/u5AU9/1/
[08:00:56] <ryanneufeld> CoolCoder: see this one: http://jsfiddle.net/ryanneufeld/u5AU9/2/
[08:01:06] <ahr1man> There is a separate server that has a json return for a URL. I'd like to use that json data on my page. This is not jsonp format, and I read that <script src=""> will work but I'm not sure about the return data
[08:01:31] <ahr1man> How can I reference that JSON data after calling it as a script?
[08:01:33] <ryanneufeld> CoolCoder: the /1 version and /2 version do the same thing
[08:02:21] <ryanneufeld> ahr1man: is the return value a script with a variable containing the JSON? or just JSON?
[08:04:13] <ahr1man> pure json :/
[08:04:23] <ryanneufeld> then you need to use jsonp
[08:04:27] <ryanneufeld> unless it's on the same domain
[08:05:45] <ahr1man> flXHR is a possibility but it seems like I should just be able to do it as a script. JSONP is not viable from the docs I read since I can't edit the server
[08:06:14] <ryanneufeld> ahr1man: I think you're misunderstanding how JSONP works
[08:06:57] <Rembane> Good morning. I'm adding file upload fields to my form with jQuery and giving them a nice unique name, but neither Chromium nor Firefox will send them when I press the submit button. Have this problem happened to you, and how did you solve it?
[08:08:04] <ahr1man> Rembane: I did something similar after finding "email form with attachments" - The file was uploaded and included on all browsers
[08:08:32] <ahr1man> ryanneufeld, almost certainly, but do I have to modify my GET or place code on the server for JSONP to work?
[08:09:04] <ryanneufeld> no, that's the point
[08:09:10] <ryanneufeld> what's the URL?
[08:09:22] <ryanneufeld> I'll show you how to do it
[08:10:05] <ahr1man> I read a bunch of examples, let's use http://myserver.com/action.php?stuff=42
[08:10:10] <Rembane> ahr1man: Okay? How did you solve it?
[08:10:26] <ryanneufeld> that URL doesn't return any JSON
[08:11:18] <ahr1man> k, this will probably give an error, but i'll try anyway
[08:11:23] <CoolCoder> ryanneufeld: both are same right?
[08:11:41] <ahr1man> http://live.nightowlgames.net/MyLairServer/DelegateServlet?act=loadRegionJSON&id=105
[08:11:43] <ryanneufeld> CoolCoder: yes, the second is a more maintainable way to write it
[08:12:02] <ryanneufeld> ahr1man: it's still valid JSON
[08:14:53] <ryanneufeld> ahr1man: this is how it should worek
[08:14:56] <ryanneufeld> *work http://jsfiddle.net/2JV7G/2/
[08:21:43] <coleGillespie> anyone good with the ajax() method?
[08:21:53] <coleGillespie> have a strange problem i can not quite figure out
[08:22:19] <coleGillespie> would help to have a second brain on it
[08:22:51] <ahr1man> ah, still valid I see ryanneufeld unfortunately Chrome complains about unexpected : token
[08:24:07] <ryanneufeld> yeah
[08:24:09] <ryanneufeld> so does FF
[08:24:19] <ryanneufeld> not sure what's causing that
[08:24:52] <paul_irish> wrap it in ( )
[08:24:55] <paul_irish> in a hug.
[08:25:02] <ahr1man> the json data is getting parsed
[08:25:21] <ryanneufeld> the JSON data?
[08:25:40] <paul_irish> ya
[08:25:52] <ryanneufeld> we don't have control of the server output
[08:26:15] <ryanneufeld> paul_irish: http://jsfiddle.net/2JV7G/3/
[08:26:26] <ahr1man> but we're scripting the output instead of interpreting the output as json. Hmmm...
[08:26:57] <ryanneufeld> paul_irish: do we need a ajaxPrefilter?
[08:27:01] <paul_irish> ooooo
[08:27:07] <paul_irish> i like the sound of that
[08:27:43] <paul_irish> yes
[08:27:49] <ryanneufeld> is it needed in this case?
[08:30:31] <paul_irish> because of the way that payload is being run,
[08:30:32] <paul_irish> yeah
[08:31:08] <ryanneufeld> I'm reading the docs, I don't see how a prefilter can help here
[08:31:13] <ryanneufeld> amiblind?
[08:31:22] <DannyZB> " $(this).removeClass("widget-create-dialog-droparea-error",2500);" -> why is it that when I use this the class transition is instant? I specified 2.5 secs
[08:31:55] <skylamer`> u try with fadeOut
[08:32:14] <tman> does anyone happen to know a plugin which takes a list and splits it into x number of lists floated say left?
[08:32:19] <ryanneufeld> paul_irish: I'm not seeing clearly here how the prefilter applies. We can change the data types, but not the data itself
[08:32:34] <tman> like how it gets styled is irrelevant acutally, just the mechanism to do that.
[08:32:37] <paul_irish> i never used it, soo
[08:32:57] <paul_irish> i'm a little confused why the data needs a hug myself
[08:33:11] <paul_irish> but tbh i hardly use ajax
[08:33:30] <ryanneufeld> so are we
[08:33:48] <ryanneufeld> it's valid JSON, and I've never seen anything act this way
[08:34:50] <ryanneufeld> wheres auborg when you need him :p
[08:35:18] <ahr1man> ryanneufeld, according to this my understanding was correct: http://www.sergeychernyshev.com/javascript/remoteloader/#example
[08:36:27] <ahr1man>  "the server must wrap the data object with a call to a callback function"
[08:37:17] <ryanneufeld> ah
[08:37:22] <ryanneufeld> that's why it needs a hug
[08:37:29] <innociv> How do I get the index of what <option> is clicked in a <select> on change for the <select>?
[08:38:21] <innociv> Christ. I  should just fake a drop down with css.
[08:38:40] <innociv> Can style it better that way
[08:40:32] <gym_jane> hey guys, got a contact form and am using "values" as labels
[08:40:52] <gym_jane> is there any of way of removing the values when corresponding field is infocus?
[08:41:04] <ryanneufeld> placeholder atr
[08:41:16] <ryanneufeld> ahr1man: I'm looking into something
[08:41:32] <gym_jane> hey ryaneufled it is slightly complicated as i don't have much control over the form
[08:41:38] <gym_jane> its a wordpress plugin
[08:43:43] <ahr1man> This almost seems to work: http://dhtmlexamples.com/2011/01/20/dynamically-loading-json-files-using-ajax/
[08:44:07] <paul_irish> ryanneufeld: oh right
[08:44:22] <paul_irish> the callback=? was trigginger jsonp mode
[08:44:41] <paul_irish> but only jsonp in jquery
[08:44:42] <gym_jane> anyone?
[08:44:44] <ahr1man> :/ even being a local file it was blocked :(
[08:44:50] <ahr1man> jsonp is a standard
[08:44:53] <paul_irish> whereas the server was like WHATEVA ill give you json back
[08:45:03] <ryanneufeld> paul_irish: yes, that seems to be what's happening
[08:45:09] <paul_irish> i would recommend piping it through a proxy
[08:45:18] <paul_irish> that can do a proper jsonp callback(payload) hug
[08:45:36] <iszak> paul_irish++
[08:45:42] <paul_irish> cuz if its just JSON, and they arent sending CORS headers...
[08:45:44] <ahr1man> ahhh great idea about the proxy to callback
[08:45:44] <paul_irish> you're out of luck
[08:45:56] <gym_jane> anyone?
[08:45:58] <paul_irish> YQL can tackle that for you
[08:46:02] <ahr1man> crap, that won't work for me though, because it would a server side request and not a client side request
[08:46:29] <paul_irish> gym_jane: you want to apply placeholder attributes to the form
[08:46:39] <paul_irish> and then run a placeholder polyfill jquery plugin
[08:47:06] <gym_jane> paul_irish i have used placeholder on a normal form before but this form is a wordpress plugin
[08:47:07] <innociv>  this.selectedIndex I see.
[08:47:12] <gym_jane> am not sure how to go about it really
[08:47:22] <gym_jane> as the plugin generates all the code
[08:47:30] <paul_irish> ahr1man: your shit would look like $.getJSON('http://yql.yahoo.com/proxy/?http://otherwserver.com/thing.json'....
[08:47:38] <paul_irish> i dont see how thats a problem ahr1man
[08:47:40] <abjorn> damnit why must vim suck so hard on windows
[08:47:57] <paul_irish> gym_jane: you just have to find some why to run script on it
[08:48:03] <paul_irish> *way
[08:48:35] <Jayflux> paul_irish you prefer text mate to DW?
[08:48:49] <paul_irish> i dont have strong feelings
[08:48:52] <abjorn> ew dreamweaver
[08:49:06] <paul_irish> all i want is sexy syntax highlighting
[08:49:34] <abjorn> nice monospaced font + bespin colors = :)
[08:49:57] <Jayflux> haha fair enough
[08:50:06] <Jayflux> i would use text mate but i need a nice simple ftp
[08:50:18] <ryanneufeld> paul_irish: that yql url doesn't work FYI
[08:50:24] <abjorn> don't need ftp built into your ide/text editor
[08:50:32] <abjorn> text editor + filezilla works wonders
[08:50:43] <tbranyen> i haven't used ftp in recent memory
[08:50:43] <bot-t1> (2 hours 32 mins ago) <kswedberg> tell tbranyen is this better for $.proxy() example? http://jsfiddle.net/kswedberg/HP7pT/ . not sure if it just confuses things more.
[08:51:06] <ahr1man> paul, the cookie for yql.yahoo.com would load, not the remote site. The remote site reads the session identifier from the cookie. No cookie = no love. Can't proxy it
[08:51:09] <ryanneufeld> paul_irish: ahr1man http://ajaxian.com/archives/using-yql-as-a-proxy-for-cross-domain-ajax
[08:51:16] <paul_irish> ryanneufeld: it worked in my brain when i made it up
[08:51:16] <abjorn> bot-t: Tell imsky to wiggle until dawn
[08:51:24] <abjorn> o bot-t1
[08:51:24] <abjorn> wat
[08:51:28] <emixam> hi, got a problem setting the src attribute of an audio tag.  so is this correct > $("audio").attr("src",filename); ?
[08:51:32] <abjorn> bot-t1: Tell imsky to wiggle until dawn
[08:51:32] <bot-t1> abjorn, Okay.
[08:53:35] <gym_jane> Paul_irish got any relevant links?
[08:53:40] <ryanneufeld> paul_irish: lulz
[08:53:48] <paul_irish> gym_jane: nah bro.
[08:54:03] <abjorn> So I'm pretty sure no one at HostGator knows how to write good JavaScript, because we have a web tool for monitoring server loads and it lags out the browser because of the shitty JavaScript
[08:54:03] <gym_jane> lol
[08:54:05] <gym_jane> ok
[08:54:14] <ryanneufeld> ahr1man: http://query.yahooapis.com/v1/public/yql?q=select%20*%20from%20html%20where%20url=http://live.nightowlgames.net/MyLairServer/DelegateServlet?act=loadRegionJSON&id=105'%20&format=json
[08:54:18] <paul_irish> abjorn: tell them
[08:54:31] <abjorn> paul_irish: lol I did
[08:54:47] <abjorn> their suggestion is to just not have the tab open for long
[08:55:02] <abjorn> which is a bad answer, but what can I do? I'm only Junior Sys Admin
[08:55:15] <paul_irish> fix it for them?
[08:55:18] <paul_irish> what jerkkks
[08:55:20] <ryanneufeld> I wish I could shoot people who write ad tags
[08:55:25] <abjorn> lol I know, right?
[08:55:38] <ryanneufeld> document.write() needs to be removed from future browsers
[08:55:48] <ryanneufeld> or cause a "are you sure" dialog so they stop using it
[08:55:48] <abjorn> Well, I'm new, and most businesses like that tend to have the "If it ain't broke don't fix it" mentality. And I guess lag isn't "broken" for them.
[08:55:53] <ryanneufeld> </rant>
[08:58:14] <abjorn> paul_irish: But then on the other hand, their other internal tools are pretty well made, so I guess there's that.
[08:58:28] <abjorn> Except that they won't let me use Chrome :( I have to use FireFox
[08:58:43] <paul_irish> :'''(
[08:59:00] <abjorn> and not even ff4 :<
[08:59:04] <paul_irish> omg
[08:59:10] <paul_irish> ff5 comes out next week
[08:59:21] <paul_irish> get that shit on the upgrade, son
[08:59:21] <abjorn> You have to be kidding me lol
[08:59:26] <paul_irish> nah not kidding
[08:59:26] <abjorn> It is?
[08:59:31] <abjorn> wtf
[08:59:34] <paul_irish> they switched to chrome's model
[08:59:38] <abjorn> yeah I was about to say
[08:59:42] <abjorn> first IE, not FF
[08:59:44] <paul_irish> 6 week cycles
[08:59:45] <abjorn> quick release model
[08:59:45] <Zucca> So... jQuery removes added script elements as soon as contents of that script is read (because some bug in IE). Is there a way to run a function after this script element is read?
[08:59:51] <ahr1man> I had a cute idea :) I just put it as a <script src=url type="text/text"></script> then I'll call that node. I already don't have any errors on the request
[09:00:00] <Jayflux> have ff5 changed their release cycles to be more like chrome?
[09:00:03] <Jayflux> ff*
[09:00:10] <paul_irish> s'what i just said bro
[09:00:15] <Jayflux> yeah just read up
[09:00:44] <abjorn> meh, it works for chrome because you don't really even notice it, it updates seamlessly. Idk if FF is going to be doing that
[09:00:46] <Jayflux> ff4 isnt too bad in all honesty
[09:00:53] <abjorn> yeah ff4 is neato
[09:00:57] <paul_irish> ++
[09:00:58] <Jayflux> ff will be the same abjorn
[09:01:06] <abjorn> oh good
[09:01:47] <abjorn> paul_irish: When I asked why we can't use Chrome they said it's because Firebug is better with Firefox. Apparently they haven't ever heard of the Chrome Dev Tools
[09:02:36] <Jayflux> i prefer firebug, simpler to use. But i now LOVE that you can see objects better in chrome's dev tools
[09:03:01] <abjorn> firebug is neato and all, and chrome dev tools owe a lot to it but dym I gotta say chrome dev tools are better
[09:03:07] <abjorn> especially as of late
[09:03:10] <paul_irish> ++
[09:03:17] <Jayflux> deffo
[09:03:21] <abjorn> I guess the problem is all our work machines have crappy chromium installed instead of proper chrome
[09:03:31] <paul_irish> eeek. doesnt autoupdate
[09:03:33] <paul_irish> check out this feature..
[09:03:39] <abjorn> yeah
[09:03:40] <paul_irish> in the styles column on the elements pane
[09:03:50] <paul_irish> of course you can edit styles.. and add new shit
[09:03:53] <paul_irish> but 1)
[09:04:02] <paul_irish> you can click the gear box and add an entirely new style rule
[09:04:12] <paul_irish> like  div:hover { background: red; }
[09:04:12] <Jayflux> changing the css properties seem quicker in firebug for me
[09:04:19] <paul_irish> SHH one sec
[09:04:25] <paul_irish> instead of just modifying existing rules
[09:04:29] <paul_irish> ENTIRELY NEW RULES yay
[09:04:30] <Jayflux> when you click on them in dev tools it doesnt change them, I know its just me being a noob with dev tools
[09:04:30] <paul_irish> and 2)
[09:04:31] <abjorn> paul_irish: yeah that feature is awesome
[09:04:45] <paul_irish> you can now edit your selectors!
[09:05:05] <abjorn> whoop whoop!
[09:05:08] <Jayflux> how paul_irish it seems like a hard job with dev tools? With Fb its pretty easy you just click em
[09:05:10] <paul_irish> of anything.. like you just doubleclick and change what was a article.main in your styles to article.happy
[09:05:19] <Jayflux> oh right
[09:05:22] <paul_irish> Jayflux: BRO I TOLD YOU TO SHH
[09:05:27] <paul_irish> ANYWAY
[09:05:28] <abjorn> lol
[09:05:41] <Jayflux> im just the voice of the people
[09:05:44] <Jayflux> you cannot shush us
[09:05:44] <paul_irish> its doubleclick vs singleclick
[09:05:53] <abjorn> Jayflux: I think he just did
[09:05:56] <paul_irish> i created an experimental build of devtools that uses singleclick
[09:06:09] <abjorn> lol
[09:06:15] <Jayflux> thats a bit evil
[09:06:23] <paul_irish> what part
[09:06:26] <paul_irish> the singleclick?
[09:06:42] <abjorn> mode (-v Jayflux) by paul_irish
[09:06:49] <paul_irish> loooool
[09:06:58] <paul_irish> it doesnt do shit, jay. :) its only for the laughs
[09:07:06] <Jayflux> fair enough lol
[09:07:14] <abjorn> well, those problems aside, I think HostGator makes up for it by having the best break room ever
[09:07:26] <abjorn> well, probably not THE BEST, but it's pretty bitchin
[09:07:58] <Jayflux> all aside keep up the good work with dev tools
[09:08:02] <abjorn> gaming computers with over 160 GB of video games, awww yeeaaah
[09:08:09] <juha___> 7 hours in a demoparty and this is all i come up with: http://dasmusik.org/demoparty/type.html
[09:08:12] <paul_irish> Jayflux: i'm slowly working on the team, convincing them that singleclick is better
[09:08:19] <abjorn> lol
[09:08:26] <Jayflux> how many to convince?
[09:08:27] <abjorn> idk i like doubleclick
[09:08:36] <abjorn> but it makes little difference in the end
[09:08:46] <paul_irish> juha___: nice ;)
[09:09:05] <abjorn> best website ever
[09:09:15] <juha___> most awesomest thing
[09:09:26] <abjorn> you, sir, are a sir among sirs
[09:11:36] <htoothrot> just a blue screen in FF
[09:11:46] <abjorn> yeah it needs webkit
[09:12:00] <Jayflux> is jquery 1.6.2 just bug updates
[09:12:13] <abjorn> since it uses @-webkit-keyframes
[09:12:18] <juha___> it's awesome when i change the animation time to 0.1s \o/
[09:12:32] <juha___> i nearly died watching it
[09:12:36] <abjorn> lol
[09:13:09] <abjorn> Seizure Machine 2.0: HTML 5 COMETH
[09:13:15] <juha___> totally
[09:15:02] <abjorn> I like how my supervisor likes to set peoples wallpapers to Justin Bieber whenever they forget to lock their computer before leaving their desk
[09:15:56] <abjorn> she said she's going to start using shirtless pictures of hasselhoff next
[09:16:02] <juha___> nice
[09:16:32] <juha___> when i forgot to lock my computer at previous work, they installed webcam under the desk and set it up to broadcast live feed...
[09:16:38] <juha___> which it did..
[09:16:40] <juha___> for three months..
[09:16:44] <aminpy> http://dpaste.com/555952/ <- this code works in firefox and Chrom, but it doesn't work in IE, how can I fix this problem?
[09:17:03] <abjorn> lmfao a webcam
[09:17:08] <abjorn> that's kind of creepy
[09:17:13] <juha___> yes
[09:17:35] <abjorn> all our workstations are dual screen so if I was the supervisor I'd switch the order of the screens
[09:17:40] <abjorn> so the right screen is really the left
[09:18:31] <Jayflux> what you do abailiss
[09:18:32] <Jayflux> abjorn
[09:20:40] <zulax> while doing a search replace, is it possible to use wildcards?
[09:21:07] <zulax> say if href="a.com/fileid=5"   and i would like to change only 5 to 6, what is the best way to do it
[09:21:17] <aminpy> can anybody help me?
[09:21:30] <RomD> zulax: use regular expressions
[09:22:10] <zulax> RomD, do you search for a number and replace it or do you match the word fileid and replace the entire content after that?
[09:22:56] <abjorn> hm?
[09:23:10] <abjorn> Jayflux: Basically customer support. That's what almost everybody at HostGator does lol
[09:23:34] <Jayflux> ah Hostgator i was going to get some web space with them, they any good?
[09:28:50] <RomD> zulax: I guess you could use something like this: "a.com/fileid=5".replace(/(fileid=)\d+/, "$16")
[09:29:54] <abjorn> Jayflux: Depends on what you're wanting to get. I think their VPS prices are kinda...way too much. But other than that, yeah.
[09:30:11] <abjorn> Their shared hosting is probably the best I know of, though.
[09:30:16] <Jayflux> ok brilliant
[09:30:36] <abjorn> Their Reseller package is brilliant for web developers. They can set up sites for all of their clients through it.
[09:31:16] <RomD> zulax: I think replace always takes the whole regex match, so you have to put the fileid back in the replacement string
[09:33:06] <ktlr> hi guys, I have got a little problem, since when I upgraded jquery to the latest "stable" version, the jquery doesn't "see" the 'selected' attribute of the div , it writes that "undefined" : http://api.jquery.com/attr/  , In earlier versions it was working corectly
[09:33:56] <Jayflux> you may need .prop instead ktlr
[09:34:04] <Jayflux> ?.prop @ ktlr
[09:34:06] <bot-t1> ktlr, .prop() - Get the value of a property for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/prop/
[09:39:18] <ktlr> Jayflux, It isn't a checkbox, it is a set of "divs" and I need the value of the selected attribute which isn't 'true' or 'selected'
[09:40:03] <Jayflux> prop should give you the value
[09:40:30] <ktlr> should .. . it gets "undefined"
[09:40:35] <Jayflux> you got a link
[09:40:35] <juha___> am i a bad person if i'm at a mozilla demoparty and using only chrome?
[09:44:25] <ktlr> Jayflux, try it this http://pastebin.com/5ysVaf4W
[09:44:35] <Jayflux> use jsfiddle.net
[09:44:37] <ktlr> with the latest version
[09:44:53] <Jayflux> http://www.jsfiddle.net
[09:45:54] <logansrun> how do i map this slider to that youtube volume
[09:45:54] <logansrun> bit.ly/jcsZOL
[09:47:09] <logansrun> http://bit.ly/jcsZOL
[09:47:37] <ktlr> well
[09:47:39] <ktlr> http://jsfiddle.net/F6Kvp/
[09:48:01] <ktlr> I don't understand why working it on this site, and why not working it in my project
[09:48:41] <Jayflux> seems to be working there ktlr
[09:50:33] <Jayflux> ktlr
[09:50:40] <Jayflux> there were changes with 1.6 and 1.6.1
[09:50:45] <Jayflux> make sure you're using 1.6.1
[09:51:33] <Jayflux> attr will behave different in both of those versions
[09:59:38] <necromancer> rgr: json_encode helps a lot but it doesn't do everything for you.
[10:00:06] <necromancer> rgr: it just converts your array into valid JSON, that's all
[10:04:27] <ktlr> Jayflux, but the attributes of the divs have been setted .... the .attr() method returns undefined for attributes that have not been set.  , so I debug it with firebug.. and firebug shows the value of the attribute .. It means that the attribute has been setted..
[10:04:57] <Jayflux> ktlr it works fine on jsfiddle so its something in your site
[10:05:08] <Jayflux> like i said, check you're using 1.6.1 and not 1.6
[10:09:29] <zulax> how do i match this -> id=5 part in a url? -> url.replace(/id=[0-9]/,new_id)
[10:10:12] <zulax> but it doesnt seem to work, does = need escape?
[10:12:34] <Jayflux> (id\=[0-9]) works for me zulax
[10:12:53] <Jayflux> .../(id\=[0-9])/
[10:12:57] <zulax> thanks
[10:13:14] <zulax> wasnt sure why wouldnt work
[10:17:59] <jrockjiggz> i have ScheduleGame.team2.value   but console is saying ScheduleGame is not defined... yet <form name="ScheduleGame"> is in the DOM

[10:26:50] <jedimind> paul's getting all emo

[10:27:15] <jedimind> sigh, i lost my job on thursday, and i am so antsy because i havent done anything in 2 days, it's ridiculous
[10:27:24] <paul_irish> jedimind: make something!
[10:27:27] <abjorn> cant tell if serious
[10:27:32] <jedimind> im serious sadly
[10:27:37] <abjorn> oh
[10:27:38] <Jayflux> sorry to hear that bud
[10:27:39] <abjorn> man that sucks
[10:27:42] <jedimind> paul_irish, im playing with a new version of my folio
[10:27:45] <Jayflux> like paul said be constructive
[10:27:55] <abjorn> move to austin and apply to hostgator, they're hiring like fuckin crazy :D
[10:27:56] <jedimind> i dont mind losing the job, i can find another one, i just hate that i got fired for no real reason
[10:28:04] <abjorn> What did they tell you?
[10:28:08] <paul_irish> jedimind: https://github.com/paulirish/lazyweb-requests/issues/35
[10:28:10] <Jayflux> are hostgator expanding or something
[10:28:12] <paul_irish> orsomething
[10:28:19] <abjorn> yeah
[10:28:21] <jedimind> basically i called someone out for their bullshit, and then they fired me because i was "difficult to work with"
[10:28:22] <abjorn> expanding like
[10:28:23] <abjorn>  a lot
[10:28:28] <paul_irish> assholes
[10:28:29] <jedimind> even though ive been there for 2 years as a manager / director of a department
[10:28:38] <jedimind> no warning, nothing, just "hey lets have a meeting" "oh youre fired"
[10:28:50] <abjorn> wow that's pretty fucked
[10:28:52] <jrockjiggz> thats normally how it goes....
[10:28:58] <Jayflux> yeah you wouldnt be allowed to do that here
[10:29:20] <abjorn> Jayflux: But yeah, they've hired something like 800+ people the last few years
[10:29:25] <Jayflux> tribunalin hell
[10:29:27] <jedimind> it's their loss, just left a shitty taste in my mouth
[10:29:40] <abjorn> what was your job?:
[10:29:40] <Jayflux> wow thats a lot abjorn, they're quite cheap as well
[10:29:45] <abjorn> mhm
[10:29:49] <jedimind> abjorn, i was a technical experience director
[10:29:51] <abjorn> except their vps, so pricye :<
[10:29:57] <jedimind> at a large agency (a WPP Group agency)
[10:30:03] <abjorn> :o nice
[10:30:41] <jedimind> i'll be employed at another agency in 2-3 weeks tops, im not worried, just came out of left field, i didnt think the cocksucker had the balls to fire me
[10:30:56] <jedimind> at least 3 $million+ projects will fail because they fired me without giving me a chance to hand anything over
[10:31:04] <abjorn> lol
[10:31:10] <abjorn> yeah definitely their loss
[10:31:34] <abjorn> well lucky you, if I got fired I'd be like "WHELP BACK TO HAVING NO MONEY"
[10:31:57] <jedimind> haha i have savings, im not stressed about money for at least 3-4 months if it comes to that
[10:32:05] <jedimind> plus i can do freelance at any point
[10:32:30] <abjorn> Yeah that's what I would be doing. But the whole reason I got this job at HostGator was because I just wasn't making nearly enough money as a freelancer.
[10:32:32] <jedimind> so the question is ... www.pud.ca/beta-v7a/ take this portfolio i coded a few months ago, and finish all th content on it?
[10:32:35] <jedimind> or work on something newer/fresher
[10:32:50] <abjorn> that portfolio looks pretty bitching man
[10:32:52] <abjorn> I say finish it
[10:33:19] <abjorn> I don't have the experience in the industry to get much work (or get paid much) doing freelance.
[10:33:24] <ktlr> web ninja :)
[10:33:27] <abjorn> lol
[10:33:38] <jedimind> it's true, im full on ninja
[10:33:38] <jedimind> haha
[10:33:55] <abjorn> I wish I could design like that :< I suck at design, I'm only good at the coding
[10:34:34] <abjorn> Which I suppose makes it ironic that I don't do back end coding, and stick to front end
[10:34:34] <jedimind> http://projects.pud.ca/myaptmap/mockup-1c/ thats still my favourite layout i've designed
[10:34:45] <abjorn> ooooo neato
[10:34:53] <abjorn> if only apartments.com had a site that looks that good
[10:34:57] <abjorn> instead they have a pile of shit
[10:36:01] <jedimind> yeah i remember finding a ton of apartment sites that had shitty layouts when i worked on this
[10:36:22] <logansrun> pleaaase somebody tell me why this is wrong
[10:36:23] <logansrun> http://pastebin.com/EFKRSghi
[10:36:26] <logansrun> my slider is sticking
[10:36:55] <abjorn> jedimind: basically all of them do
[10:36:56] <fwaokda> how can i view my source after my jquery code executes?
[10:37:05] <jedimind> fwaokda, use firebug ?
[10:37:20] <fwaokda> jedimind, ok thanks i'll try that :)
[10:37:28] <abjorn> logansrun: I don't understand why you're doing $(myplayer.setVolume(100));
[10:37:31] <jedimind> or view generated source with the web developer toolbar in firefox
[10:37:57] <jedimind> logansrun, also i would imagine your init of the slideshow should happen on document.ready
[10:38:13] <abjorn> it is, jedimind
[10:38:20] <logansrun> abjorn i want to use setvolume of the val
[10:38:24] <logansrun> of the slider, my mistake
[10:38:28] <fabio_> WOW
[10:38:31] <fabio_> so many ppl
[10:38:32] <fabio_> :)
[10:38:37] <abjorn> lol
[10:38:39] <paul_irish> 808 is nuthin
[10:38:47] <abjorn> logansrun: wrapping that in $() won't really do anything
[10:38:55] <logansrun> ok
[10:38:55] <jedimind> abjorn, no it's not? $(funciton() is not the same as document.ready
[10:38:55] <paul_irish> i think we hit 900 on weekdays now
[10:39:10] <logansrun> i'm trying to set the volume of a youtube with a slider
[10:39:20] <logansrun> myytplayer.setvoume(val)
[10:39:20] <fabio_> i want to change a div background color with the click of submit buttom
[10:39:24] <logansrun> dunno how to write that tho
[10:39:25] <fabio_> so im doing this
[10:39:42] <fabio_> $("#yep").css(background-color:yellow;);
[10:39:53] <abjorn> jedimind: I beg to differ
[10:39:59] <fabio_> but im thinking this is not right
[10:40:04] <abjorn> jedimind: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery/#jQuery3
[10:40:06] <jedimind> abjorn, only if he places it at the bottom of the page
[10:40:06] <Fox`> does draggable not work on some elements like tr?
[10:40:18] <jedimind> ah i stand corrected
[10:40:21] <abjorn> $(function() { }); is a shortcut
[10:40:22] <abjorn> :p
[10:40:51] <abjorn> logansrun: What is myplayer?
[10:41:19] <logansrun> its the name of a youtube
[10:41:33] <jedimind> bbiab
[10:42:09] <abjorn> Okay, well, I'm not really familliar with whatever API you're using, but I imagine you probably meant to have $(myplayer).setVolume(100); Or, in fact, probably just myplayer.setVolume(100); without the $()
[10:44:06] <abjorn> jedimind: your portfolio links to a twitter that doesn't exist :<
[10:44:50] <djQuery> ok what am I doing wrong here? http://jsfiddle.net/djquery/PeUEJ/
[10:45:35] <juha___>             console.log(this.options.source]);
[10:45:36] <juha___> that
[10:45:55] <djQuery> I never get an autocomplete to show. I thought in 1.9 when you did it with self inheritance you didnt have to call the original _create as it was called automaticaly
[10:46:30] <fabio_> at the end of functions i dont need to put ;
[10:46:31] <djQuery> juha___: http://jsfiddle.net/djquery/PeUEJ/1/
[10:46:33] <fabio_> ???
[10:46:55] <djQuery> fabio_: nope
[10:47:24] <juha___> fabio_: it's good practice to have them
[10:47:30] <fabio_> djQuery and inside of functions?
[10:47:37] <djQuery> fabio_: function test(){ return false; }
[10:47:51] <fabio_> ya
[10:48:01] <djQuery> opps wrong language syntax
[10:48:03] <fabio_> djQuery like this
[10:48:29] <djQuery> nope I had it right
[10:48:33] <fabio_> $(#test).click(function(){
[10:48:56] <fabio_> $(this).fadeOut(1000);}
[10:49:09] <fabio_> )
[10:49:22] <fabio_> that ; its necessary
[10:49:22] <logansrun> abjorn http://www.predrinksradio.com/test
[10:49:30] <logansrun> trying to do the setvolume function
[10:49:48] <abjorn> it would probably help if the video was viewable lol
[10:49:55] <djQuery> fabio_: $('#test').click(function(){ $(this).fadeOut();});
[10:50:28] <fabio_> djQuery even inside of $(document).ready   ?
[10:50:47] <djQuery> ?101@fabio_
[10:50:47] <bot-t1> fabio_, New to JavaScript? You should read this first: http://eloquentjavascript.net/contents.html
[10:51:46] <djQuery> fabio_: let me try to add spacing to show where the function ends and notice that there is no ; at the end of the function $('#test').click(function(){ $(this).fadeOut(); }      );
[10:52:27] <juha___> chrome f12 AWESOMENENESESSS
[10:52:38] <fabio_> yes i understand
[10:53:32] <paul_irish> oh yeah my tweet just went out didnt it
[10:55:57] <abjorn> every time I get on steam I ask myself
[10:56:09] <abjorn> "why is there someone on my friends list named Johnny Cuntwreck"
[10:56:25] <vladikoff> ha
[10:57:31] <fabio_> djQuery whats wrong with this ? http://codepad.org/b24PpUFy

[10:58:05] <jedimind> abjorn, the twitter link is outdated, as much of stuff on there :)
[10:58:06] <abjorn> fabio_: should be $("#yep")
[10:58:24] <geekbuntu> abjorn, was wondering why no tics
[10:58:30] <djQuery> fabio_: or $('#yep')
[10:58:38] <pen> how do I share variable between two events?
[10:58:39] <abjorn> no! $("#yep") !

[11:05:20] <fabio_> .css("background", "blue");
[11:05:29] <Jayflux> abjorn ill follow you for some lols
[11:05:36] <abjorn> I like how people are getting tech support through @hostgator. tech support through twitter lololol
[11:05:41] <abjorn> lol ok
[11:05:54] <juha___> Jayflux: you should follow me, if you want some hot girl-on-girl action
[11:06:03] <abjorn> lfmao
[11:06:08] <abjorn> so that's how you get people to follow you
[11:06:13] <geekbuntu> i think twitter would be the way to do tech support - takes longer to hear the whining
[11:06:16] <abjorn> brilliant
[11:06:17] <Jayflux> juha___ its the internet, you don't need to follow people to see that
[11:06:28] <Jayflux> this isnt Yahoo chat
[11:06:40] <juha___> this isn't?!
[11:06:44] <abjorn> oh shit
[11:06:46] <djQuery> fabio_:  its .css('background-color', 'blue')
[11:06:46] <juha___> i've been wrong the whole time
[11:06:48] <abjorn> what did i miss, since when isnt it
[11:06:58] <Jayflux> about a few weeks ago
[11:06:58] <fabio_> yeo
[11:07:02] <juha___> shiiiiit

[11:07:07] <abjorn> how could i have missed it
[11:07:12] <Jayflux> Y! pulled out man
[11:07:20] <djQuery> fabio_: or its .css({'background-color': 'blue'})
[11:07:24] <geekbuntu> did somebody say boobies?
[11:07:26] <geekbuntu> o.0
[11:07:31] <geekbuntu> 0.0

[11:08:01] <geekbuntu> ty
[11:08:20] <fabio_> djQuery the Jquery doo all things of ajax?
[11:08:27] <abjorn> rofl
[11:08:40] <abjorn> Jayflux: Technically I do know a discount coupon I'm allowed to give to new customers
[11:09:01] <Jayflux> o? i will be a new customer and im still considering other options, so a discount would seal the deal for me
[11:09:06] <Jayflux> making you a top salesman
[11:09:32] <geekbuntu> 5% off 2 yr prepaid?
[11:09:35] <geekbuntu> :-D
[11:09:37] <Jayflux> rofl
[11:09:43] <juha___> NICE OFFER
[11:09:44] <djQuery> fabio_: why do you keep askin me in particular instead of just askin in general? Am I your personal jquery suport\trainer all of a sudded?
[11:09:52] <djQuery> fabio_: see ?jqf
[11:09:52] <Jayflux> 49% off
[11:09:53] <bot-t1> fabio_, jQuery Fundamentals, an open-source jQuery Book -- http://jqfundamentals.com/book/
[11:09:54] <abjorn> Jayflux: All you have to do is go to the online chat from hostgator.com and ask if there's a coupon they can give you
[11:09:58] <geekbuntu> 49?
[11:10:03] <geekbuntu> do you have to massage them too?
[11:10:09] <geekbuntu> sheesh
[11:10:10] <Jayflux> that sounds like effort
[11:10:27] <juha___> is there a promise of happy ending?
[11:10:30] <fabio_> djQuery sounds you know a lot :P
[11:10:31] <geekbuntu> sounds like a bad salesman
[11:10:41] <djQuery> fabio_: not all of it good
[11:10:47] <geekbuntu> any salesman that drops that fast is weak
[11:10:57] <geekbuntu> (in russian voice) you must krush them
[11:11:13] <juha___> geekbuntu: get out of my head
[11:11:14] <Jayflux> shh geekbuntu
[11:11:16] <abjorn> geekbuntu: well we aren't supposed to be stingy with it. Because it's honestly like...not a great coupon lol
[11:11:33] <geekbuntu> i know - i did isp sysadmin work for years
[11:11:43] <geekbuntu> the connection is there... runs 24/7 regardless -
[11:11:50] * djQuery hmmmm you want a 49% discount, here let me mark it up 100% then give you the 49% discount
[11:11:51] <geekbuntu> might as well make as much as possible
[11:11:53] <abjorn> basically what it does is give you your first month of shared hosting for $0.01
[11:12:06] <Jayflux> ill check the packages in a min
[11:12:11] <abjorn> but after that it's full price so
[11:12:25] <abjorn> it's better than the default coupon though
[11:12:28] <geekbuntu> scared to ask... but if you know - does hostgator handle python?
[11:12:34] <abjorn> yeah it does
[11:12:36] <geekbuntu> not 'handle the python'
[11:12:36] <Jayflux> nice
[11:12:39] <geekbuntu> cool
[11:12:47] <geekbuntu> i use bottle/webpy often
[11:12:51] <abjorn> for something like django you'd probably need a vps or dedi though
[11:12:52] <geekbuntu> i like the web.py
[11:12:54] <abjorn> gotta have dat root
[11:12:59] <djQuery> anyone know of a host that has node.js support
[11:13:03] <Jayflux> i know you said before abjorn but what do you do there?
[11:13:13] <geekbuntu> sales?
[11:13:14] <juha___> djQuery: apt-get install nodejs ;)
[11:13:44] <geekbuntu> abjorn, isn't hostgator in upstate new york?
[11:13:49] <djQuery> juha___: ok anyone know of a realy frigin cheap vps or dedi then
[11:13:50] <geekbuntu> (upper cny)
[11:14:01] <abjorn> nah
[11:14:04] <abjorn> HostGator is in Texas
[11:14:05] <geekbuntu> djQuery, yes
[11:14:07] <abjorn> Austin and Houston
[11:14:11] <abjorn> and I do tech support
[11:14:15] <abjorn> call center, online chat, that kinda thing
[11:14:21] <tallisman> when using ajax I mostly refer to php, make php do it's job, get some mysql data for example, but this got me thinking.. is it possible to connect to other languages, for example C# as well?
[11:14:24] <juha___> djQuery: amazon ec2 is pretty cheap
[11:14:39] <juha___> djQuery: micro is free, with limits, cheapest one is something like $25/month
[11:14:44] <vladikoff> Linode!
[11:14:51] <geekbuntu> 10 bucks a month vps - i use these ppl, the owner is good to follow up http://www.grokthis.net/
[11:14:54] <geekbuntu> which is rare
[11:14:59] <geekbuntu> for my commercial accounts i use linode
[11:15:02] <geekbuntu> 25 each
[11:15:10] <geekbuntu> linode is very good for the price
[11:15:11] <abjorn> I use a VPS from Volume Drive
[11:15:12] <abjorn> $5/mo
[11:15:29] <abjorn> for 2.0 GHZ CPU, 1 GB RAM, 50 GB HDD, and uh 200 GB bandwidth i think
[11:15:39] <geekbuntu> seriously?
[11:15:41] <juha___> we've been thinking about hiring devs from austin, as there seems to be a lot of excellent people
[11:15:41] <geekbuntu> that's awesome
[11:15:44] <abjorn> shit support though, so there's a reason it's so cheap
[11:15:50] <abjorn> and by shit support I mean like. really shit.
[11:15:51] <Jayflux> ahh yeah abjorn, my work uses rackspace cloud
[11:15:52] <abjorn> like almost none
[11:16:00] <Jayflux> im chattin to their tech support all the bleedin time
[11:16:17] <abjorn> But I don't really need tech support with my VPS so I'm fine with the tradeoff
[11:16:22] <geekbuntu> abjorn, volume drive good/great?
[11:16:28] <abjorn> oh, nevermind, 2000 GB bandwidth
[11:16:30] <geekbuntu> okay?
[11:16:37] <abjorn> uuuhm
[11:16:43] <abjorn> well the VPS runs great
[11:16:46] <abjorn> the control panel for it is crap
[11:16:48] <abjorn> but workable
[11:16:57] <geekbuntu> grokthis is home grown
[11:17:05] <geekbuntu> the man who owns it was the original developer for cpanel
[11:17:11] <geekbuntu> so... it has a 'feel to it'
[11:17:29] <abjorn> Volume Drive uses vePortal as a control panel for VPS
[11:17:41] <geekbuntu> sounds like vpspeed setup
[11:18:03] <geekbuntu> volumedrives 8.95 deal looks pretty good
[11:18:06] <abjorn> It has just about everything you would need for a VPS, tbh, it's just a slow control panel, and the interface is awful
[11:18:21] <abjorn> the VPS themselves run real nice, though, and you have basically every choice of OS you'd want
[11:18:31] <abjorn> although why you'd use anything other than centos is beyond me
[11:19:09] <geekbuntu> hostgator vps says you get .5ghz (POINT FIVE) on their bottom package
[11:19:13] <geekbuntu> amd 500
[11:19:14] <geekbuntu> o.0
[11:19:15] <abjorn> yep
[11:19:23] <abjorn> and no control panel for level 1 and 2 vps with hostgator
[11:19:31] <geekbuntu> i know a man in brasil that hosts a website on an old phone
[11:19:33] <abjorn> because they're simply too underpowered to have one
[11:19:35] <geekbuntu> from his isp
[11:19:46] <geekbuntu> for a small site it would be ok
[11:19:55] <geekbuntu> ironic
[11:20:04] <abjorn> HostGator has such overpriced VPS because they have much more support than most VPS hosts
[11:20:08] <juha___> abjorn: centos is terrible :P
[11:20:08] <geekbuntu> they have kickass software (virtuozzo) and crap hardware specs
[11:20:11] <abjorn> but tbh I don't think it's worth it
[11:20:25] <abjorn> juha__: Not for servers. It's shitty as a desktop distro. But it's like the defacto for servers
[11:20:35] <vladikoff> but which VPS accepts bitcoin, that's the question
[11:20:43] <abjorn> lol
[11:20:55] <geekbuntu> i know they accept henway
[11:21:06] <abjorn> uuuhm hostgator accepts
[11:21:15] <paul_irish> you and hostgator..
[11:21:15] <abjorn> credit card, paypal, check...and cash, actually lol
[11:21:23] <paul_irish> i got food stamps
[11:21:27] <abjorn> rofl
[11:21:28] <paul_irish> can i have domain plz
[11:21:40] <juha___> abjorn: i've only used it in server. but i'm getting the hang of it, and only reason i dislike it is that it's not debian :P
[11:21:45] <abjorn> maybe if you came to the office and gave it to them paul lol
[11:21:49] <geekbuntu> make a deal with pinky out back - he'll give you fitty cent on the dolllar for foot stamps
[11:21:50] <paul_irish> ok
[11:21:52] <paul_irish> will do
[11:23:00] <geekbuntu> theres a checkbox at the bottom of the vps page - very small... if you don't check it saying you require the full POINT FIVE ghz - you only get 1GHZ
[11:23:03] <geekbuntu> wtf?
[11:23:06] <abjorn> geekbuntu: The $15 volume drive vps package is a pretty badass deal. I want to upgrade mine to it
[11:23:18] <geekbuntu> on volume drive?
[11:23:25] <geekbuntu> they have some incredible packages
[11:23:29] <geekbuntu> if that's who you mean
[11:23:33] <abjorn> yeah
[11:23:50] <abjorn> $15/mo for 4 GHZ CPU, 4 GB RAM, 150 GB HDD, and 4 TB transfer
[11:23:54] <geekbuntu> i have so much in so many languages hosted on vps's that i'm scared to combine them
[11:24:01] <abjorn> lol
[11:24:02] <geekbuntu> as i get comfortable i'm consolidating them to linode
[11:24:11] <geekbuntu> hopefully between no more than 2 beefed up vps accounts
[11:24:26] <geekbuntu> i do something weirdass and host it alone/solo for a while
[11:24:49] <geekbuntu> at least until the check clears
[11:24:50] <geekbuntu> :-D
[11:27:59] <djQuery> abjorn: does it accept bitcoin?
[11:28:36] <geekbuntu> it accepts henway
[11:29:01] <juha___> by having awesome contacts, i don't pay for my hosting anymore, but then again, i don't have any huge projects
[11:29:30] <abjorn> djQuery: lol uh i dont think so
[11:29:44] <geekbuntu> i juha___ , can i be a contact?
[11:29:51] <geekbuntu> hi*
[11:30:27] <juha___> geekbuntu: you want to offer me free hosting? nice
[11:30:38] <geekbuntu> juha___, i was going to help you utilize yours
[11:30:40] <geekbuntu> :-D
[11:30:47] <abjorn> I like how I can get a Reseller account from HostGator for practically free, but I can't actually resell hosting lol
[11:30:49] <geekbuntu> we could repurpose it
[11:30:58] <ryrych> hello
[11:31:18] <geekbuntu> *pin drops*
[11:31:27] <abjorn> sup
[11:31:45] <juha___> geekbuntu: well, i have some projects that need extra help, if you scratch my back, i can try to get you free/supercheap hosting in finland.
[11:32:00] <abjorn> finland hosting awww yeeaaah
[11:32:01] <geekbuntu> do i have to wear a mink glove?
[11:32:03] <geekbuntu> :-D
[11:32:12] <juha___> yes
[11:32:24] <geekbuntu> juha___, you rascal
[11:32:47] <geekbuntu> juha___, talk to me next time - if i have time, i'll do it
[11:33:05] <djQuery> first time in like 2 weeks that I have had less that 20 browser tabs open. down to 7
[11:33:20] <geekbuntu> i'm popping adderall like m&m's and i can't focus
[11:33:31] <tbranyen> geekbuntu: heart strain will do that
[11:33:49] <geekbuntu> i have had an erection longer than 4 hours though - wondering if i should dial 911
[11:34:02] <geekbuntu> :-P
[11:34:06] <abjorn> I don't think adderall is supposed to do that
[11:34:08] <juha___> you should not
[11:34:13] <geekbuntu> omg - wrong blue pills
[11:34:22] <geekbuntu> i cna't focus and i am ready for long night of love
[11:34:36] <abjorn> I think paul_irish can help you alleviate that
[11:34:57] <tbranyen> geekbuntu: bullshit, if you're popping adderall you aren't ready for any kind of love
[11:35:01] <tbranyen> except the disappointed kind
[11:35:28] <ryrych> is it #jquery or #erection? :D
[11:36:06] <abjorn> idk about you but whenever I'm in #jquery I have an #erection
[11:36:09] <abjorn> the two are very relevant
[11:36:26] <abjorn>  /join #erection
[11:37:15] <juha___> abjorn: that channel is empty :(
[11:37:25] <abjorn> lol but im in it right now
[11:37:39] <systemfault> The chan or your girlfriend^
[11:37:40] <systemfault> ?
[11:37:47] <abjorn> they're one in the same
[11:37:53] <fabio_> i want to display the loaded content into an div
[11:37:54] <fabio_> http://codepad.org/dugArXMx
[11:37:58] <ryrych> he and bot
[11:38:00] <fabio_> how to do it?
[11:38:24] <systemfault> fabio_: see jQuery.load
[11:38:27] <abjorn> i really should eat, i am starving
[11:38:29] <abjorn> but...so lazy
[11:38:30] <paul_irish> ? jQuery.load
[11:38:31] <bot-t1> paul_irish, .load() - Load data from the server and place the returned HTML into the matched element. http://api.jquery.com/load/
[11:38:31] <juha___> ?load @ fabio_
[11:38:32] <bot-t1> fabio_, .load(handler): Bind an event handler to the "load" JavaScript event. http://api.jquery.com/load-event/
[11:38:44] <juha___> i fail
[11:38:44] <fabio_> but like this i cant doo it?
[11:38:54] <systemfault> fabio_: Sure.. just more trouble.
[11:38:58] <paul_irish> way easier like that fabio
[11:39:23] <fabio_> yes but i want to make an assyncronous connection
[11:39:31] <RobW> hey guys.. i'm not getting any errors but for some reason when I do $("#id").find("li." + className).length, it's returning 0.. I know that the #id exists and that the li.asdf classes exist, so why is it returning 0?
[11:39:42] <fabio_> if the page change will change too there
[11:39:44] <systemfault> fabio_: .load is async..
[11:40:03] <fabio_> i mean sync
[11:40:05] <systemfault> fabio_: It's just yet another facade on .ajax
[11:40:28] <systemfault> fabio_: Then why do you write async: true in your snippet?
[11:40:43] <geekbuntu> tbranyen, it was a joke
[11:40:44] <systemfault> fabio_: And second... using sync is pretty much stupid.
[11:41:01] <fabio_> why
[11:41:10] <systemfault> fabio_: Because it blocks the browser.
[11:41:23] <fabio_> you mean freeze?
[11:41:26] <paul_irish> yes
[11:41:28] <systemfault> fabio_: Right.
[11:41:28] <paul_irish> freeeeeze
[11:41:38] <fabio_> oh god
[11:41:39] <fabio_> lol
[11:41:47] <fabio_> so
[11:41:50] <paul_irish> so
[11:41:54] <fabio_> what i can do is an refresh
[11:42:01] <fabio_> every x seconds
[11:42:12] <paul_irish> this is doing downhill.
[11:42:20] <paul_irish> s/d/g/
[11:42:22] <geekbuntu> it's going there too
[11:42:28] <paul_irish> going gownhill.
[11:42:30] <fabio_> i want to make an chat
[11:42:35] <geekbuntu> o.0
[11:42:50] <fabio_> so to do that i need to refresh the content
[11:42:53] <systemfault> fabio_: Then why do you return markup?
[11:43:11] <systemfault> fabio_: Return the data and build the markup from it.
[11:43:19] <geekbuntu> fabio_, i'm just a simple man, but why reinvent the wheel?
[11:43:38] <fabio_> could give me an example?
[11:43:39] <systemfault> geekbuntu: Because nobody learns if they don't.
[11:43:40] <geekbuntu> he calls himself dud?
[11:43:41] <fabio_> geekbuntu
[11:44:03] <geekbuntu> systemfault, oh - it's an exercise - got it
[11:44:12] <systemfault> geekbuntu: In his case, no way to know..
[11:44:39] <juha___> if going downhill is bad, going uphill is good?
[11:44:42] <systemfault> geekbuntu: I think he's another guy who thinks he can write an application in Javascript before learning the language
[11:44:50] <systemfault> juha___: More difficult for the legs.
[11:44:54] <geekbuntu> i have to earn money - so if somebody asks me for a chat - i do what i need to in order the meet the need as perfectly as possible as quickly as possible (use a plugin/adapt)
[11:45:11] <juha___> systemfault: also more strokes.
[11:45:14] <geekbuntu> systemfault, long road of heartache
[11:45:15] <systemfault> Haha
[11:46:48] <juha___> haha one of the demo from this evening: http://dl.dropbox.com/u/91363/demo/index.html
[11:46:56] <juha___> *spoiler alert* it contains unicorns
[11:48:17] <systemfault> Who doesn't like unicorns? :/
[11:48:29] <systemfault> Oh noes, double-meme :(
[11:48:42] <geekbuntu> they're good with steak sauce
[11:48:53] <systemfault> You're forgiven since it's HTML5 and not flash
[11:50:47] <karasrk> test
[11:51:24] <ryanneufeld> passed
[11:51:40] <ryrych> 404
[11:52:09] <karasrk> first time here
[11:52:11] <karasrk> xD
[11:52:16] <ryanneufeld> now your hooked
[11:52:38] <karasrk> should have found this place earlier xD
[11:53:46] <ryrych> interesting greeting ;)
[11:53:51] <ryrych> xD
[11:54:17] <ryrych> ↑ this reminds me sweet teenagers ;)
[11:54:49] <ryrych> but maybe I am a bit bored today :)
[11:55:32] <abjorn> I have yet to find a CouchDB library for NodeJS that I like...
[11:55:35] <abjorn> :<
[11:55:56] <paul_irish> hipster.
[11:56:06] <abjorn> am not D:
[11:56:10] <geekbuntu> abjorn, can you not use mongodb?
[11:56:25] <abjorn> geekbuntu: I'm using CouchDB for something
[11:56:40] <geekbuntu> abjorn, mongodb no like couch
[11:56:43] <ryrych> paul_irish: hipster? what does it mean :D
[11:56:53] <geekbuntu> a square i think
[11:57:01] <paul_irish> nooooo
[11:57:06] <geekbuntu> or hip from another decade?
[11:57:10] <ryanneufeld> ryrych: it means hippie
[11:57:14] <paul_irish> wat
[11:57:22] <abjorn> geekbuntu: I like MongoDB, but CouchDB works better for this. There is another project I'm going to be working on that I'm probably going to use MongoDB for, though.
[11:57:25] <ryanneufeld> yes, hipsters are modern hippies
[11:57:28] <paul_irish> WHAT
[11:57:36] <abjorn> that is not at all what a hipster is
[11:57:36] <paul_irish> hippies are modern hippies.
[11:57:39] <ryrych> I don't catch up modern english slang
[11:57:47] <geekbuntu> hipsters aren't modern hippies?
[11:57:51] <paul_irish> NOOOO
[11:57:54] <geekbuntu> paul_irish is confusing us
[11:57:56] <abjorn> A hipster is someone who goes against anything that is popular.
[11:57:58] <geekbuntu> someone make him stop
[11:57:59] <abjorn> Sort of
[11:58:07] <zulax>  $('#songnum'+x+').attr  -> how to get the variable workign
[11:58:09] <paul_irish> http://www.latfh.com/
[11:58:32] <systemfault> Example: "jQuery is too mainstream, I'll go with prototype!
[11:58:32] <geekbuntu> remove the second quote and plus sign
[11:58:35] <abjorn> They're the kind of people that only listen to obscure indie bands, and once that band gets popular they instantly hate them
[11:58:43] <ryrych> paul_irish: so who did you call a hipster? :D
[11:58:49] <closedbracket> Spoon anybody?
[11:58:50] <geekbuntu> he calls a lot of us hipster
[11:58:54] <geekbuntu> o.0
[11:58:57] <ryrych> haha
[11:58:57] <systemfault> Example: "Google Chrome is too mainstream, I'll go with w3m!"
[11:59:04] <geekbuntu> figured i was getting called old in a polite way
[11:59:05] <paul_irish> abjorn because 1) he's using couch. 2) he's using node 3) he's too good for all the libraries that combine the two
[11:59:06] <ryanneufeld> hipsters are the hippies of our day
[11:59:20] <ryanneufeld> hippies are the hippies of their day :p
[11:59:20] <paul_irish>  /kick ryanneufeld false
[11:59:25] <geekbuntu> paul_irish, but he admitted being open to using them if it called for it
[11:59:29] <geekbuntu> so he's a pirate
[11:59:33] <paul_irish> a PIRATE
[11:59:34] <paul_irish> waht
[11:59:39] <geekbuntu> pilages
[11:59:43] <geekbuntu> takes what he needs
[11:59:43] <abjorn> not sure how that makes me a pirate...
[11:59:46] <paul_irish> uhhhhh
[11:59:50] <geekbuntu> sounds better than hipster
[11:59:55] <abjorn> uuhhmm
[11:59:57] <abjorn> lol
[12:00:00] <abjorn> not a hipster tho >=o
[12:00:01] <geekbuntu> baddass vs interior designer
[12:00:02] <paul_irish> lets go back to when i called abjorn something and he understood what i meant and NO ONE ELSE DID
[12:00:09] <abjorn> rofl
[12:00:10] <juha___> hey mr. google, please add colorpicker to devtool <3
[12:00:16] <paul_irish> PATCHES WELCOME
[12:00:27] <abjorn> NO BOT-T WHY
[12:00:30] <paul_irish> :)
[12:00:37] <geekbuntu> this channel cracks me up sometimes :-D
[12:00:41] <RobW> anyone else keep getting this error: attempt to run compile-and-go script on a cleared scope [Break On This Error] b[0]&&b[0].ownerDocument||c);var h=[],..."px")}}),a.jQuery=a.$=f})(window);/*!
[12:00:46] <abjorn> oh thank god, bot-t is back
[12:00:49] <geekbuntu> all we need is imsky now
[12:00:51] <systemfault> juha___++
[12:00:53] <ryrych> I don’t know why I always think paul_irish is Irish :D (and don't take it personally) :D
[12:00:58] <geekbuntu> he is
[12:01:14] <geekbuntu> the lineage of the name is scotch-irish
[12:01:18] <ryanneufeld> I've heard paul_irish drinks like he is
[12:01:28] <geekbuntu> i've seen him on a video tut wasted
[12:01:38] <geekbuntu> i got dizzy watching him
[12:01:38] <RobW> ?abortion
[12:01:39] <bot-t> function abortion() { $(document).children().die(); }
[12:01:45] <RobW> and it still remains :)
[12:01:46] <systemfault> Anyone having an easter egg with a video of erasure on its website is weird :/
[12:01:47] <ryanneufeld> haha, I've seen him wasted IRL
[12:02:00] <abjorn> paul_irish: Using Node would make me more mainstream than hipster these days, wouldn't it?
[12:02:07] <ryrych> but who get an erection watching him? :D
[12:02:13] <geekbuntu> (abjorn, yes)
[12:02:18] <ryanneufeld> ryrych: TMI
[12:02:19] <abjorn> I mean, maybe not 6 months ago when I started playing around with it lol
[12:02:27] <systemfault> abjorn: Still hipster imho
[12:02:36] <abjorn> see
[12:02:37] <abjorn> im not
[12:02:37] <abjorn> a hispter
[12:02:41] <paul_irish> yeah.. "so i was using node and wrote a few npm modules but got bored so now i'm writing a package manager for haskell instead."
[12:02:47] <ryrych> ryanneufeld TMI?
[12:02:48] <abjorn> because once it gets mainstream ill still love it <3
[12:02:55] <abjorn> lol haskell? nah fuck that
[12:02:56] <djcoin> Hi all.
[12:03:01] <paul_irish> hi coins
[12:03:02] <ryrych> hi
[12:03:04] <abjorn> sup
[12:03:08] <geekbuntu> for a sec i thought it was bitcoin
[12:03:10] <djcoin> :)
[12:03:34] <ryrych> loong evening
[12:03:47] <paul_irish> systemfault: why you hate erasure
[12:03:52] <paul_irish> why you hate easter
[12:03:54] <RandalSchwartz> hey paul_irish
[12:03:58] <paul_irish> RandalSchwartz: ! whats up man
[12:04:36] <systemfault> paul_irish: The guy is weird... :/
[12:04:40] <djcoin> bitcoins, i cant imagine that really works
[12:04:44] <systemfault> paul_irish: I like easter eggs though
[12:04:47] <RandalSchwartz> $client wants me to upgrade from jq-1.4 and jq-ui-1.7.2 to the latest
[12:04:51] <RandalSchwartz> trying to figure out what might break
[12:05:07] <RandalSchwartz> is that easy to find on the docs?
[12:05:08] <systemfault> paul_irish: Also, Robot Unicorn Attach has traumatized me.
[12:05:09] <djcoin> btw, I had a question :) Do you know which libs (I guess JQuery is ok) should be good to make some simple animation: like making a popup slide/shake ?
[12:05:13] <systemfault> *Attack
[12:05:14] <ryanneufeld> ?tmi @ ryrych
[12:05:18] <bot-t> ryrych, Friday, 2011-05-27 - http://services.jquery.com/#jqueryui-dev_20110527.log.html
[12:05:33] <ryanneufeld> shit
[12:05:44] <ryanneufeld> ryrych: TMI== To much information
[12:05:57] <systemfault> AH :/
[12:05:58] <djcoin> And a second one ! Are they some animations (eg: css tricks or so) that are not cross-browser ? Disclaimer: I did not used much "animation" stuff in jquery
[12:05:59] <abjorn> cascarones > easter eggs
[12:06:06] <ryrych> ah, I see
[12:06:17] <gesman> Hello
[12:06:18] <systemfault> It's not "Too Many Interfaces"? That's what I see when I use java :/
[12:06:27] <paul_irish> RandalSchwartz: i dont know about the UI side of things, but things should be fine on the jq side. small changes.. and we had some breaking stuff but it was resolved in a minor release
[12:06:30] <ryrych> hello
[12:06:38] <djcoin> 'lloo
[12:06:54] <abjorn> lol systemfault
[12:06:59] <paul_irish> the UI blog has the changes listed between versions but i havent caught wind of anything significant
[12:07:09] <gesman> Q: What's a good solution to prevent "jerking" when updating element via: $("#my_div").html(more_html);  ?
[12:07:19] <M_ikeR> does anyone here know of a good way to bind an event just before a DOM element is blurred?
[12:07:23] <abjorn> I just see a bad language when I see Java, but that's just me, systemfault
[12:07:38] <RandalSchwartz> some bad encumbered language :)
[12:07:52] <RandalSchwartz> looks like Oracle is playing hardball with Google, for example
[12:07:55] <systemfault> abjorn: I see a language that has its evolution stalled to please some corporations
[12:07:56] <RandalSchwartz> oops - offtopic :)
[12:07:59] <M_ikeR> i hate oracle
[12:08:02] <ryrych> ok, but being serious: I've been writing in jQuery/UI for 2 yrs; do you think guys jQuery will be around in a few years?
[12:08:03] <M_ikeR> greedy bastards
[12:08:04] <abjorn> loolol
[12:08:14] <GoGoGarrett> I would say so
[12:08:18] <abjorn> ryrych: I see no reason why it wouldn't be.
[12:08:31] <djcoin> there greed only equals their stupidity :)
[12:08:34] <djcoin> their *
[12:08:37] <geekbuntu> according to douglas crockford yii will take over in 2012
[12:08:45] <geekbuntu> *yui
[12:08:46] <systemfault> yii?
[12:08:53] <abjorn> When a library has gotten to the point to where people don't even realize it's just a library for JavaScript, you can pretty well assume it's got staying power.
[12:09:08] <geekbuntu> hence = .net
[12:09:09] <abjorn> lol, love and respect for the crock, but that's not gonna happen
[12:09:09] <ryrych> of course, I am not writing in *jQuery* only but also in JS
[12:09:20] <systemfault> abjorn: What's yii?
[12:09:26] <wkmanire> Howdy folks.
[12:09:29] <geekbuntu> i think ppl forget jquery is a wrapper around a construct
[12:09:31] <paul_irish> geekbuntu: did he say that?
[12:09:33] <paul_irish> sup wkmanire
[12:09:36] <ryrych> abjorn: yeah, people are writing in jQuery, not js
[12:09:41] <djcoin> abjorn: Or you may assume your developers should learn javascript
[12:09:43] <djcoin> :b
[12:09:51] <M_ikeR> i want to see coffeescript get adopted by new versions of ecma
[12:09:51] <abjorn> djcoin: that too
[12:09:59] <M_ikeR> the syntax is beautiful'
[12:10:00] <geekbuntu> paul_irish, he said something close, but did not mention any flavors
[12:10:17] <paul_irish> http://miketaylr.com/mustdie/
[12:10:25] <abjorn> hey wkmanire
[12:10:28] <systemfault> M_ikeR: Would be an intelligent move... The harmony guys being dumb.
[12:10:31] <oxez> hello. http://pastebin.com/6yAiXzX2 => This works on the first click on a.ajax elements. If I close the dialog and click again, it will just follow the <a> href link, and get this error: $("#dialog").dialog is not a function. What am I doing wrong?
[12:10:35] <paul_irish> http://miketaylr.com/mustdie/?yui
[12:10:36] <wkmanire> Oh not a whole lot. Just popping in to see whats going on.
[12:10:49] <geekbuntu> paul_irish, in video 5 of his good parts seminars he said that html5 has gone amuck - needs to be scrapped and rewritten before it's fully adopted... im starting to think he's right - too many hands in the pot
[12:10:53] <abjorn>  paul rofl
[12:10:55] <abjorn> MUST DIE
[12:11:00] <paul_irish> geekbuntu: wat
[12:11:05] <geekbuntu> hi paul_irish
[12:11:12] <systemfault> http://miketaylr.com/mustdie/?jQuery :P
[12:11:13] <paul_irish> elaborate plz
[12:11:16] <systemfault> </troll>
[12:11:24] <geekbuntu> maybe i can find the link
[12:11:25] <paul_irish> yah i'm ready for this.
[12:11:26] <geekbuntu> o.0
[12:11:32] <paul_irish> no no no i am aware of HIS flawed perspective.
[12:11:40] <ryanneufeld> http://miketaylr.com/mustdie/?document.write()
[12:11:40] <M_ikeR> systemfault: what's harmony?
[12:11:41] <wkmanire> yui must die? what?
[12:11:41] <paul_irish> i'm asking for why you think that's a legit opinion
[12:11:43] <abjorn> scrapped and rewritten? not so much. changed a bit? probably
[12:11:49] <wkmanire> I've never even used YUI but I thought it had a decent reputation.
[12:12:03] <systemfault> M_ikeR: What is going to become perhaps ecmascript 6 or 7..
[12:12:04] <geekbuntu> paul_irish, oh - the html5 statement?
[12:12:05] <jedimind> https://toronto.bixi.com/ one of the nicest implemetnations of google maps ive seen in a while
[12:12:09] <abjorn> YUI is fairly well respected
[12:12:13] <abjorn> that site is a joke
[12:12:14] <RandalSchwartz> I used YUI for a while, switched to jq
[12:12:21] <abjorn> YUI is neato.
[12:12:32] <paul_irish> geekbuntu: yes. is there anything in particular you have issue with
[12:12:33] <abjorn> But I'd rather use jQuery or Dojo
[12:12:34] <emx> how do i append html code to an element?
[12:12:34] <djcoin> (re-posting my question:) Im kinda noobs with animation and want to do simple one (like shaking a popup), should I head for Jquery stuff (what then ? css() function ?) ? Second bonus overkill function: are they some "animation feature" that are not crossbrowser in JQ ?
[12:12:40] <systemfault> abjorn: You understand that it's a generator?
[12:12:46] <abjorn> yeah
[12:12:49] <paul_irish> $(htmlcode).appendTo('div.someelement') // emx
[12:12:51] <djcoin> s/function/question/
[12:12:54] <systemfault> http://miketaylr.com/mustdie/?abjorn
[12:13:03] <abjorn> http://miketaylr.com/mustdie/?PAUL%20IRISH didn't work
[12:13:10] <geekbuntu> paul_irish, personally - i've only had a couple of complaints so far - i find i have problems integrating plugins (specifically jq-ui) into html5 schema
[12:13:17] <paul_irish> djcoin: use .animate()   it works crossbrowser. you can do some shake stuff with it
[12:13:29] <geekbuntu> i found a couple of good boiler plates - they seem to work well for me :most of the time:
[12:13:36] <abjorn> http://miketaylr.com/mustdie/?wiggle wiggle will catch on i swear to god it will
[12:13:44] <paul_irish> all those html5 boiler plates out there are crap
[12:13:49] <geekbuntu> paul_irish, ironically, one of them is yours (the stripped down ones)
[12:13:51] <geekbuntu> huh?
[12:13:53] <wkmanire> abjorn: I was waiting for that
[12:13:56] <wkmanire> he he he
[12:13:57] <abjorn> lol
[12:13:57] <paul_irish> i am JK ing
[12:14:01] <abjorn> had to be done wkmanire
[12:14:06] * abjorn wiggles
[12:14:08] <geekbuntu> i will not stand here and listen to you call paul_irish's work craqp
[12:14:15] <geekbuntu> omg
[12:14:16] <wkmanire> Literally counting down. "uh, he said shake. 3...2....1.... "
[12:14:20] <abjorn> yeah paul_irish, how dare you
[12:14:28] <paul_irish> :)
[12:14:35] <geekbuntu> he needs to spend some bitcoin on a counselor
[12:14:52] <paul_irish> i did a talk last weekend where i uncovered THE REAL html5 boilerplate
[12:14:55] <geekbuntu> http://answers.oreilly.com/topic/1483-doug-crockford-discusses-javascript-html5-security-issues/
[12:15:02] <geekbuntu> that's new (to me - old in the calendar)
[12:15:07] <emx> paul_irish, thank you
[12:15:09] <geekbuntu> prolly resolved since then
[12:15:23] <abjorn> http://miketaylr.com/mustdie/?windows8 my thoughts exactly, crock
[12:15:26] <paul_irish> doug likes mashups.
[12:15:33] <djcoin> paul_irish: thanks a lot for your answer ! Do you know by any chance other libs that may fit too ? (like jsanimation, processing.js, etc. ?)
[12:15:35] <geekbuntu> i have this incredible urge to bow my head when crockford speaks
[12:15:59] <djcoin> The best should be a synthesis on all possibility offered for animation
[12:16:01] <paul_irish> djcoin: not for small animations.. jquery is great for that.. processing.js is good for visualizations
[12:16:04] <systemfault> Doug is a good guy but some of his points are just BS
[12:16:09] <abjorn> I have an incredible urge to intently listen to everything he has to say and then after words think "Hm, he needs to tone it down a bit"
[12:16:20] * wkmanire has an epiphany about the must die site.
[12:16:24] <djcoin> Ok, I will go for that at first then
[12:16:24] <paul_irish> orly
[12:16:26] <geekbuntu> abjorn, the good parts book is good...
[12:16:26] <djcoin> Thanks a lot
[12:16:28] <paul_irish> yup
[12:16:33] <abjorn> geekbuntu: well naturally
[12:16:39] <geekbuntu> but he adds a lot of his opinion in wherever it will fit
[12:16:41] <paul_irish> you guys have to see this commit he had recently...
[12:16:48] <geekbuntu> no
[12:16:49] <abjorn> http://miketaylr.com/mustdie/?mustdie
[12:16:50] <geekbuntu> wat?
[12:17:08] <ryrych> abjorn: oh, no, infinite loop :D
[12:17:20] <paul_irish> https://github.com/douglascrockford/JSLint/commit/a27d17cd46
[12:17:22] <geekbuntu> he didn't use var....o.0
[12:17:33] <M_ikeR> contenteditable makes me want to stab myself in the eyes
[12:17:38] <ryrych> pseudo code :D
[12:17:42] <paul_irish> he reversed the meaning of like 5 options
[12:17:50] <paul_irish> which clearly breaks all backwards compat
[12:17:51] <geekbuntu> he's getting old
[12:17:55] <geekbuntu> time to put him down i think
[12:17:58] <abjorn> well that's pretty annoying
[12:17:59] <wkmanire> So what happened with JSHint? I thought the community had pretty much adopted it over JSLint?
[12:18:08] <tbranyen> wkmanire: i still use it
[12:18:12] <paul_irish> wkmanire: i believe that is the case, yes.
[12:18:14] <abjorn> yeah im kinda tired of jslint
[12:18:20] <abjorn> I end up turning off so many options of jslint anyways
[12:18:22] <geekbuntu> json lint is ok
[12:18:24] <ryrych> what is JSHint?
[12:18:36] <paul_irish> anton (of jshint) watches the jslint repo intently to see if theres anything he shoudl pull over
[12:18:45] <wkmanire> ?jshint @ ryrych
[12:18:49] <paul_irish> ryrych: its a fork of jslint that doesnt suck
[12:18:50] <abjorn> ryrych: it's a fork of jslint that makes it less opinionated
[12:18:52] <systemfault> abjorn: I don't use it anymore.. too opinionated to my taste, moreover.. I hate the opt-out approach
[12:18:57] <wkmanire> bot-t: You're fired.
[12:19:06] <abjorn> bot-t logged off :<
[12:19:10] <abjorn> he's been mia a lot lately
[12:19:15] <abjorn> makes me sad
[12:19:38] <geekbuntu> he's starting to sound like martha stewart...(good parts, good things???)
[12:19:38] <ryrych> paul_irish: as far as I know, jQuery docs for writing plugins mention jslint :)
[12:19:58] <abjorn> jslint is still good if you turn off a bunch of options lol
[12:19:58] <ryrych> I have it printed
[12:20:07] <abjorn> and turn on some others
[12:20:22] <systemfault> geekbuntu: IMHO, even the good parts is not even needed :P
[12:20:46] <systemfault> geekbuntu: Everything that's good in that book is available as videos on yuitheatre
[12:21:00] <systemfault> *yuitheater
[12:21:06] <abjorn> http://miketaylr.com/mustdie/?coffescript oh no, crock, what have you done?!
[12:21:08] <wkmanire> Are the train track diagrams on there?
[12:21:10] <geekbuntu> systemfault, i 'think' (& even he says) to be careful because when libraries adopt the supplant and his other ground breaking methods that one should remember to remove it
[12:21:19] <paul_irish> ryrych: o rly
[12:21:25] <wkmanire> Those were pretty good I thought.
[12:21:42] <geekbuntu> systemfault, and i have not read ecma lately - maybe supplant is/will be there soon?
[12:21:42] <paul_irish> ryrych: where is it? ill fix
[12:22:03] <ryrych> paul_irish: rly, rly: ‘jQuery core passes JSLink with a few stipulations …’
[12:22:06] <paul_irish> k
[12:22:18] <djcoin> Put him down :) http://miketaylr.com/mustdie/?%E2%87%A2
[12:22:26] <systemfault> geekbuntu: Sorry, what are you talking about? :(
[12:22:36] <M_ikeR> lol, nice djcoin
[12:22:38] <geekbuntu> it doesn't matter
[12:22:40] <geekbuntu> :)
[12:22:49] <djcoin> :) of course im kidding
[12:23:23] <TheBigNorwegian> i have an ID that can be either an <input> or a <select> and I want to get the .text() of the field. For <input> I can use $("#id").text() and <select> i can use $("#id option[value='$(#id).val()']").text(), but is there a way I can get the text without knowing if the field is an <input> or <select>?
[12:23:34] <abjorn> paul_irish: You know what, maybe I am a hipster, cause I'm just gonna make my own CouchJS node module ;( one that can also work in the browser...yeah!
[12:23:39] <abjorn> COuchJS?
[12:23:40] <abjorn> CouchDB
[12:23:42] <systemfault> Am I the only one who thinks that the ecmascript guys are repeating the same mistake again with ECMAScript Harmony?
[12:23:46] <abjorn> it's been a long week...
[12:24:03] <RandalSchwartz> doesn't look like the 1.7.2 to 1.8 ui changes will affect me
[12:24:08] <RandalSchwartz> now for testing :)
[12:24:15] <juha___> offtopic: anyone here using mongodb with php?
[12:24:20] <systemfault> I mean... that it will ends up beside ECMAScript 4... in a garbage bin.
[12:24:35] <M_ikeR> systemfault: dont have any background on it..why do you think they are making a mistake?
[12:24:57] <abjorn> systemfault: Maybe so. I really like a lot of the things they're doing with it.
[12:24:59] <systemfault> M_ikeR: Modifies the language too much
[12:25:03] <abjorn> but
[12:25:06] <systemfault> M_ikeR: In a non-incremental manner
[12:25:15] <abjorn> some other things, like alternate function syntax...
[12:25:19] <abjorn> idk
[12:25:19] <paul_irish> abjorn: https://github.com/mikeal/pouchdb
[12:26:09] <abjorn> paul_irish: :o interesting
[12:26:11] <wkmanire> heh
[12:26:26] <wkmanire> Seems to me the JavascriptWeekly's primary purpose is to introduce new libraries.
[12:26:32] <abjorn> basically lol
[12:26:45] <systemfault> :)
[12:26:46] <wkmanire> And there are always 2 or 3 almost every week.
[12:26:52] <wkmanire> Its mind boggling.
[12:28:07] <wkmanire> It seems like before you make up your mind to write a new "anything large and modular" these days you should do a google search first. Then wait a week, then do another google search and then ask in the IRC, then finally, start your project.
[12:28:10] <abjorn> brb\
[12:30:12] * ryrych a few days ago came across yayquery and is going to watch it :)
[12:30:14] <M_ikeR> is anyone here really knowledgable with rangy?
[12:30:30] <M_ikeR> it seems like an awsome lib but the docs are hard to consume
[12:30:45] <abjorn> still waiting on the next yayquery :<
[12:30:45] <djcoin> http://miketaylr.com/mustdie/?%E2%98%AD
[12:30:47] <djcoin> rofl
[12:30:51] <djcoin> made my day
[12:30:57] <abjorn> loooll
[12:31:05] <M_ikeR> I've been using the selection save/restore rangy feature, but it makes the cursor disappear
[12:31:14] <ryrych> +100 :D
[12:31:27] <djcoin> ^_^
[12:31:47] <ryrych> but it is really sad
[12:31:54] <abjorn> djcoin: I tried z̶̮̤̓ͪ̽͑̑a̵̩̪̪̺̬ͬ̑l̡̪͎̱̤̪̀͛̈g̡̦͗͋̅ͫ̋͆o̪̥͐ͨ̚͢ but it broke it :<
[12:31:55] <M_ikeR> djcoin: how'd you do that, is it a unicode symbol?
[12:31:55] <ryrych> by the way
[12:32:02] <djcoin> M_ikeR: yup
[12:32:07] <M_ikeR> nice
[12:32:33] <abjorn> http://goo.gl/U3yIN ah here we go
[12:32:48] <djcoin> ouch !
[12:33:06] <M_ikeR> make it rain...weird characters
[12:33:17] <abjorn> http://www.eeemo.net/
[12:33:44] <ryrych> http://miketaylr.com/mustdie/?%E2%82%AC
[12:33:46] <M_ikeR> funny, that looks like my source code in most projects when its done
[12:34:01] <abjorn> http://goo.gl/wmAZx even better!
[12:34:14] <smik> Do we have a plugin which can show jpg slide show along with a video player which runs in a synchronized way?
[12:34:42] <ryrych> smik: do you mean a mediabox?
[12:34:48] <ryrych> kinda mediabox
[12:34:48] <djcoin> http://miketaylr.com/mustdie/?%E2%98%B9
[12:35:15] <smik> ryrych: I'll run a video lecture and I want that the slide should show up in parallel
[12:35:16] <ryrych> oh no, sad smiley :(
[12:35:52] <ryrych> smik: I see
[12:35:58] <abjorn> ?zalgo

[12:36:36] <smik> I was also looking forward for a WebDAV plugin through which I can access a WebDAV resource.
[12:36:57] <smik> I was looking at jDav but it doesn't offer authentication I guess
[12:37:08] <djcoin> You could do so controversial stuff, there are unicode character for homosexual mariage and disabled people !
[12:37:31] <djcoin> Wont use them cause my sense of humour / art may be too big for some
[12:37:36] <djcoin> :x
[12:37:45] <wkmanire> djcoin: I was trying to get Mr. Crockford to motorboat some ASCII boobs but it just doesn't want to work.
[12:37:59] <wkmanire> djcoin: http://miketaylr.com/mustdie/?Motorboat%20________(._Y_.)
[12:38:07] <wkmanire> maybe you can pick up where I left off on this noble task.
[12:38:07] <ryrych> djcoin: in some countries homophobia is punished :D
[12:38:15] <abjorn> loll
[12:38:30] <RandalSchwartz> Hmm.  some buttons stopped working once I went to 1.6.1
[12:38:34] <RandalSchwartz> that's not a good sign. :(
[12:38:54] <RandalSchwartz> now I have to figure out how to recreate his environment locally
[12:39:01] <wkmanire> RandalSchwartz: jQuery-UI buttons?
[12:39:13] <RandalSchwartz> I'm not sure. some other coder.
[12:39:15] <abjorn> http://imgur.com/gallery/u8BOr
[12:39:28] <djcoin> wkmanire: seems good :) but not sure, what does "motorboat" should mean here ? :)
[12:39:51] <wkmanire> djcoin: Sometimes when a man feels a certain way about a woman...
[12:39:58] <wkmanire> djcoin: And they want to share a special time together
[12:40:03] <djcoin> lol
[12:40:14] <wkmanire> djcoin: Well, one thing leads to another and you know...
[12:40:15] <djcoin> I guess, i just had to ask !
[12:40:35] <djcoin> What does virgin mean ?
[12:40:50] <djcoin> :)
[12:41:32] <abjorn> it's another word for you
[12:42:02] <wkmanire> oooooooh, that was mean.
[12:42:12] <paul_irish> heyyyyyy be nice
[12:42:28] <abjorn> lol
[12:42:33] <abjorn> it had to be done
[12:42:52] <abjorn> I can't resist setups like that :<
[12:43:03] <M_ikeR> I"m not sure what a virgin is I just remember driving by a star wars convention with my dad and hearing him yell it at a group of kids out the window
[12:43:26] <djcoin> lol :)
[12:44:04] * wkmanire has the rebel alliance symbol tatooed on his right shoulder.
[12:44:12] <RandalSchwartz> hmm.  safari is complaining "The first argument must be a beforeLoad event object."
[12:44:17] <RandalSchwartz> is that a jq error?
[12:45:14] <djcoin> Googling "unicode symbols for boobs" get me nowhere, yet: http://miketaylr.com/mustdie/?Motorboat%20_________%E2%98%89%E2%98%89
[12:45:25] <djcoin> wkmanire: ^
[12:45:32] <wkmanire> "A" for effort.
[12:45:33] <djcoin> Pitifull attempt
[12:45:49] <djcoin> :b
[12:46:02] <wkmanire> your tongue smiley is upside down.
[12:46:03] <wkmanire> :P
[12:46:59] <djcoin> Well it depends of your face I guess :)
[12:47:11] <RandalSchwartz> Yeah - I'd really like to know "first argument of *what*?" :)
[12:47:20] <RandalSchwartz> hmm. wasn't related to 1.4 to 1.6.1 change though
[12:47:27] <RandalSchwartz> old site does it too
[12:47:34] <wkmanire> RandalSchwartz: Me too, I don't recognize that error as being generated by jQuery, or caused by it.
[12:47:54] <wkmanire> RandalSchwartz: Can you post the section of your code that raises that exception in Safari?
[12:48:09] <M_ikeR> anyone out there starting any cool companies/projects?
[12:48:57] <djQuery> no good at regular expressions what would be the regular expresion to split on ", "    ?
[12:49:17] <RandalSchwartz> I can't find it
[12:49:27] <RandalSchwartz> oddly - safari doesn't give it a line number like everything else
[12:49:32] <djQuery> nevermind /,\s*/
[12:50:07] <wkmanire> djQuery: console.log("1,2,3,4,5,6,6".split(/,/g))
[12:50:59] <wkmanire> RandalSchwartz: That sucks. Start cutting out major features until the bug stops happening.
[12:51:03] <shesek> no need for the g flag on split
[12:51:03] <shesek> and you don't need a regex either, simply '1,2,3,4,5,6'.split(',')
[12:51:24] <M_ikeR> in fact, avoid regex if you can help it, it's slower
[12:51:58] <RandalSchwartz> yeah - clearly, there's been more than a few "designers" in here, and they've just thrown random tag soup at the beginning
[12:52:04] <djQuery> wkmanire: console.log("1,2,3,4,5,6,6".split(/,\s*/)   not trying to split on , but rather ", "
[12:52:09] <djQuery> ,space
[12:52:52] <djQuery> M_ikeR: ^^^ got a better way to do that?
[12:53:06] <djcoin> My latest attempt: http://miketaylr.com/mustdie/?%E2%98%9E%20%20________...%E2%99%BB
[12:53:06] <RandalSchwartz> so "foo,bar, bletch" would be only two elements?
[12:53:08] <djcoin> :)
[12:53:09] <M_ikeR> can you remove white space and split on that?
[12:53:42] <M_ikeR> either that or split on , and trim each token you get back
[12:54:10] <M_ikeR> or you can be lazy like me: http://phpjs.org/
[12:54:12] <RandalSchwartz> djQuery - why do you want ", " ?
[12:54:15] <djcoin> wkmanire: what grade ?
[12:54:18] <djcoin> :)
[12:54:19] <RandalSchwartz> that's an odd thing to split on
[12:54:28] <djcoin> which *
[12:54:57] <wkmanire> M_ikeR, djQuery: I would say, use a Regex when possible. Possible is a pretty loose term, but if you can avoid multiple string operations by using a single Regex it will simplify the code.
[12:55:18] <wkmanire> obviously if you have to split 10 thousand lines of text individually you have to consider performance.
[12:56:22] <wkmanire> We don't use jQuery selectors because they are the fastest way to get elements out of the DOM. :)
[12:56:26] <M_ikeR> It comes down to personal preference I suppose. personally I think regex is overkill when there are much faster native string functions for simple things like splitting and simple replacement
[12:56:50] <tbranyen> regex is really really useful in a lot of cases
[12:56:56] <M_ikeR> but for any sort of non trivial pattern matching, I'd def use regex
[12:56:58] <RandalSchwartz> Eeek.  What's a <cssscriptdict import>
[12:57:06] <RandalSchwartz> who put this crap in here?
[12:57:18] <M_ikeR> it's also great for validating alphanumeric *across locales*
[12:57:22] <wkmanire> RandalSchwartz: Looks like something that is supposed to be parsed server side.
[12:58:06] <djQuery> RandalSchwartz: autocomplete for an input that accepts more than 1
[12:58:25] <M_ikeR> a lot of people insist that you validate input, but good luck finding a validation function that handles alpha numeric in other languages
[12:58:28] <wkmanire> djcoin: He he, I already got bored of that site. Glad you're having fun.
[12:58:45] <M_ikeR> \/^[\p{L}\p{N}]{3,20}/u
[12:59:04] <djcoin> oh :|
[12:59:11] <djcoin> kk
[12:59:33] <M_ikeR> of course that wont work in any browser because none of them support PCRE unicode regex lol
[12:59:39] <M_ikeR> but good for php/ruby/perl/etc
[12:59:41] <RandalSchwartz> I'm also trying to figure out why safari doesn't believe this /head is the real /head
[13:00:13] <RandalSchwartz> can anyone see anything broken in http://insightcruises.com/ ? I'm not seeing why it's ending the /head early
[13:00:17] <Dev0n> hey, is there a way to make $.param to work with a value only based array ?
[13:00:37] <djQuery> RandalSchwartz: no errors in chrome 13
[13:00:53] <RandalSchwartz> weird.  maybe it's just safari then
[13:00:55] <closedbracket> \help
[13:01:40] <RandalSchwartz> can you figure out what line the body is actually beginning on
[13:01:54] <RandalSchwartz> or is it it really at <body ...> ?
[13:02:27] <djcoin> Last one, before I make something usefull :)
[13:02:29] <djcoin> http://miketaylr.com/mustdie/?Noone%20%20______%E2%9C%8C&%E2%9D%A4
[13:02:43] <wkmanire> RandalSchwartz: Was this site drawn with DreamWeaver?
[13:02:53] <djcoin> http://miketaylr.com/mustdie/?Noone%20%20______%E2%98%AE&%E2%9D%A4
[13:02:55] <djcoin> sry
[13:02:58] <RandalSchwartz> No... but parts of it might be frankensteinish
[13:02:58] <wkmanire> djcoin: lol
[13:03:08] <RandalSchwartz> like I said, lots of designers have had a hand in here
[13:03:22] <RandalSchwartz> Hmm.  Firebug also says no errors
[13:03:24] <djQuery> RandalSchwartz: that whole resizeable text is a pain
[13:03:25] <RandalSchwartz> so what is safari bitching about?
[13:04:07] <wkmanire> RandalSchwartz: Why do you open up a new page for every link in the main navigation?
[13:04:10] <wkmanire> that is really annoying.
[13:04:27] <RandalSchwartz> Not my choice. :)
[13:04:30] <djQuery> RandalSchwartz: yes it is ^^^^^^^^^^^
[13:04:48] <djQuery> and all the pages look different as well
[13:04:58] <RandalSchwartz> yeah - again, many hands in this pie
[13:05:11] <RandalSchwartz> My only task is to figure out why 1.6.1 breaks it for now
[13:05:20] <wkmanire> WYSIWYHYG - What You See Is What You Hope You Get.
[13:05:21] <wkmanire> :D
[13:06:01] <RandalSchwartz> ahh - might be the doctype
[13:06:05] <RandalSchwartz> xhtml strict
[13:06:09] <djQuery> Web site respondents. Fill out a form once — you're eligible to win FOREVER  and get spam for infinity
[13:06:14] <RandalSchwartz> who uses that now? :)
[13:06:19] <wkmanire> try <!DOCTYPE html>
[13:07:52] <M_ikeR> wkmanire: booyah! html5 doctype
[13:07:56] <RandalSchwartz> even changing to html 4.01 transitional didn't help safari's misparse
[13:07:58] <M_ikeR> xhtml can suck my balls
[13:08:18] <Dev0n> is there a public json encode function within jquery ?
[13:08:38] <M_ikeR> Devon: theres one built into newer browsers, but not jquery
[13:09:04] <Dev0n> ahh
[13:09:17] <M_ikeR> theres a good one here that is the defacto standard: http://www.json.org/js.html
[13:09:25] <Dev0n> cool, thx
[13:09:32] <M_ikeR> glad to help for once
[13:10:51] <juha___> html 3.2 is the one and only
[13:11:34] <miketaylr> that's awesome djcoin
[13:12:35] <djcoin> miketaylr: Thanks :) Nothing much original but It was pretty fun :)
[13:12:47] <miketaylr> ha, i lolled
[13:13:42] <M_ikeR> I cant lol any more, it was surgically removed :(
[13:14:11] <miketaylr> my consolences, M_ikeR
[13:14:15] <djcoin> Damn
[13:14:21] <miketaylr> condolences, even
[13:15:10] <djcoin> Amazing how such simple things that enables user input, (such as a simple page with a get parameter that accepts a few letters) can lead to creativity
[13:15:22] <djcoin> s/enables/accept/
[13:15:46] <miketaylr> this is what separates us from the primates
[13:15:51] <closedbracket> ?????????????????????????
[13:15:58] <closedbracket> my bad
[13:16:01] <miketaylr> haha
[13:16:11] <djQuery> why is this $.ui..keyCode.TAB ? shouldn't this be in jquery instead of jquery.ui?
[13:16:14] <miketaylr> would have been cooler if it was ]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]
[13:16:26] <djcoin> lol nonsense
[13:16:30] <closedbracket> trying to figure out this weechat nonsense
[13:16:46] <djcoin> or even: 8===========D~~
[13:16:53] <djQuery> M_ikeR: I thought the json encode was in jquery now?
[13:16:53] <djcoin> closedbracket: im on weechat
[13:17:33] <closedbracket> djcoin: I'm just getting started and I want to scroll, but on a mac the F keys are madness. So I guess I need to remap them. What do you use?
[13:17:37] <M_ikeR> djQuery: is it? The last time I tried calling JSON.stringify I was getting a not defined error
[13:18:05] <djcoin> miketaylr: omg just figure out that its name is closed bracket thus your joke. Dont push me out :)
[13:18:19] <miketaylr> :P
[13:18:43] <djcoin> closedbracket: scroll in the current buffer ?
[13:18:48] <closedbracket> djcoin: yes
[13:19:00] <djcoin> closedbracket: you can join the #weechat btw, people answer quick and good
[13:19:16] <closedbracket> miketaylr: actually, it's a bit misnamed as the nick derives from my hatred of }
[13:19:23] <djcoin> I use the "special arrow" dont know their name
[13:19:55] <miketaylr> :}
[13:20:06] <djcoin> you know the one closes to the "Home" and End keys, well i guess this conversation should move on weechat
[13:20:28] <closedbracket> djcoin: yeah, I'll go there. thanks man.
[13:20:34] <djcoin> + im being an idiot, with my inability specifying some key :b
[13:20:49] <djcoin> np
[13:22:06] <RandalSchwartz> OK - I've isolated a page which when shifting from 1.4 to 1.6.1 breaks with "Syntax error, unrecognized expression: [href=../itinerary_g/yk01_itinerary.html]"
[13:22:24] <RandalSchwartz> and safari has no hint of where that breaks
[13:22:27] <RandalSchwartz> lemme try firefox
[13:22:42] <djQuery> M_ikeR: I was thinking of http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.parseJSON/
[13:23:13] <RandalSchwartz> great - firefox just says the same thing... an "uncaught exception"
[13:23:15] <RandalSchwartz> and the same message
[13:23:19] <RandalSchwartz> no hint of what line threw it
[13:23:53] <M_ikeR> djQuery: cool! I didn't know this func even existed. Is there a reverse? (going from a json object back to string)
[13:23:59] <RandalSchwartz> did selectors change from 1.4 to 1.6.1?
[13:24:42] <djQuery> M_ikeR: doesnt look like it a search turned up some plugins but typicaly when there is a reverse of a jquery it will be listed in the doc
[13:25:00] <M_ikeR> ahh ok
[13:25:08] <djQuery> https://gist.github.com/754454
[13:25:13] <RandalSchwartz> oh - I think I know where the code might be
[13:25:30] <RandalSchwartz> would the use of .attr break in insightcruises.com/js/cgi-go.js ?
[13:26:23] <RandalSchwartz> I remember reading that .attr is now different somehow
[13:26:44] <abjorn> I like how another web host is following me on twitter, but @hostgator isn't
[13:26:44] <tbranyen> RandalSchwartz: attr and prop, attr is for dom node attributes prop is for object properties
[13:27:57] <RandalSchwartz> or maybe insightcruises.com/js/InSightCruises.js
[13:28:23] <RandalSchwartz> yeah - then .attr should still be right
[13:28:34] <RandalSchwartz> and yet i'm getting that error message for an "expression" that is broken
[13:28:43] <RandalSchwartz> but it doesn't have a filename/linenumber :(
[13:31:00] <RandalSchwartz> ok - commenting out insightcruises.com/js/InSightCruises.js removes the error
[13:31:03] <M_ikeR> RandalSchwartz: jquery 1.6 broke the shit out of my attr code :( I had to change from this $('#some_elem').attr('disabled', '');    to   $('#some_elem').removeAttr('disabled'):
[13:31:13] <djQuery> RandalSchwartz: commnet out each script till u get it?
[13:31:23] <RandalSchwartz> now what part of that might be using .attr wrong?
[13:32:13] <M_ikeR> RandalSchwartz: how are you using it
[13:32:22] <djQuery> M_ikeR: $('#someelm').prop('disabled', false);
[13:33:18] <M_ikeR> oh thats right they added prop for things like disabled, etc
[13:34:43] <djQuery> RandalSchwartz: M_ikeR: http://which-should-i-use.ossreleasefeed.com/
[13:35:34] <M_ikeR> djQuery: awesome, thats educational
[13:37:23] <M_ikeR> looks like I have some code to fix now
[13:37:49] <djQuery> M_ikeR: find and replace is ur friend
[13:38:00] <M_ikeR> yeah I just grepped and found all the uses
[13:38:45] <dancannon> Hi, Whats the best practice for javascript on click events? I have around 8 buttons that call different functions. Should I just use onclick="functionname()" or should I use jQuerys event handling?
[13:39:34] <djQuery> dancannon: $('#buttonid').click(function(){ do something here });
[13:39:38] <djcoin> dancannon: keep separate html markup for the structure of the document from its behaviour (javascript)
[13:40:36] <dancannon> Ok, does this not cause any issues with having 8 different click events?
[13:42:19] <M_ikeR> dancannon: no, though its likely with that many events tied to one button, you will have to be careful about one event being handled before another
[13:42:41] <M_ikeR> for example if event 3 needs to always be done before event 5, etc
[13:42:50] <dancannon> M_ikeR: No I have 8 events tied to 8 buttons, sorry I wasnt clear
[13:42:55] <djQuery> grrr think the _settimeout is gonna get broken in my multiple autocomplete
[13:42:56] <M_ikeR> ahhhh
[13:43:26] <M_ikeR> does html5 have field hints built in?
[13:43:44] <M_ikeR> like default text that will disappear after the field i clicked or emptied
[13:43:52] <dancannon> HTML5 has placeholders
[13:43:53] <djQuery> yes
[13:43:56] <dancannon> yes
[13:43:57] <M_ikeR> placeholders
[13:43:59] <M_ikeR> cool
[13:44:04] <M_ikeR> they are called 15 different things
[13:44:10] <M_ikeR> thanks
[13:44:12] <dancannon> placeholder="Field Hint"
[13:44:16] <M_ikeR> nice
[13:44:24] <djQuery> M_ikeR: and there are about 500 plugins to make it work in crappy browsers
[13:44:35] <djQuery> I mean work in IE
[13:44:36] <M_ikeR> just going in this channel i think my code quality for this project will improve significantly
[13:44:50] <M_ikeR> Im not concerned with old browsers
[13:44:52] <M_ikeR> only the new ones
[13:45:05] <M_ikeR> I'm building a product targeted at developers
[13:45:12] <M_ikeR> so I'm willing to leave legacy in the dust
[13:46:45] <djQuery> M_ikeR: there are simple enough shivs out there that after you get it done apply a shiv and see if it now works on older browsers whenu get done
[13:47:12] <djQuery> M_ikeR: I am starting everything with this now days anyway http://html5boilerplate.com/
[13:47:23] <M_ikeR> you mean like modernizr to detect if the feature is there, or do you mean actually implement the feature for you in the background?
[13:47:34] <djQuery> yes
[13:48:37] <M_ikeR>  I guess it's something to think about
[13:48:48] <M_ikeR> I worry it would be hard to retrofit this into a large project
[13:49:12] <paul_irish> all of h5bp? yes. very much
[13:49:30] <paul_irish> oh input placeholders?
[13:49:39] <paul_irish> should not be hard to retrofit at all/
[13:49:53] <paul_irish> ?g github mathias placeholder
[13:49:54] <bot-t> paul_irish, automatic loading by gpupo for mathiasbynens/Placeholder ... - GitHub - https://github.com/mathiasbynens/Placeholder-jQuery-Plugin/pull/6
[13:50:01] <paul_irish> good enough
[13:52:50] <djQuery> dang it the other day I had a link that shimed all the html5 form elements
[13:57:42] <djQuery> M_ikeR: ah here it is http://afarkas.github.com/webshim/demos/demos/webforms.html
[13:58:40] <M_ikeR> nice!
[14:00:26] <RandalSchwartz> is there any way in firebug or safari debugger to show a full backtrace and not just the exception?
[14:00:27] <M_ikeR> is .prop('disabled', false)    the same thing as   .removeProp('disabled')
[14:00:30] <RandalSchwartz> I want to know what's throwing this
[14:01:02] <djQuery> RandalSchwartz: think there is in chrome
[14:01:13] <RandalSchwartz> ahh.  did the syntax for .filter() change?
[14:01:34] <RandalSchwartz> I should be able to say .filter('[href=../itinerary_g/yk01_itinerary.html]') right?
[14:02:27] <djQuery> RandalSchwartz: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8SS-rUEZPg
[14:02:36] <Infinitas> t
[14:02:54] <djQuery> Infinitas: u
[14:03:25] <Infinitas> djQuery: :P
[14:04:01] <paul_irish> RandalSchwartz: you need quotes around the attribute value
[14:04:53] <djQuery> RandalSchwartz:  .filter('[href="../itinerary_g/yk01_itinerary.html"]') right
[14:04:59] <gym_jane> i am still stuck with this field value issue :(
[14:05:29] <RandalSchwartz> yeah
[14:05:37] <RandalSchwartz> I have that
[14:05:44] <RandalSchwartz> oh - around the value?
[14:05:46] <RandalSchwartz> did that change?
[14:05:57] <djQuery> yes
[14:06:22] * RandalSchwartz rushes off to change that
[14:11:50] <jrockjiggz> is there a way to see if any js is bind to an el?
[14:12:29] <RandalSchwartz> Yeah yeah - that fixed it
[14:12:31] <RandalSchwartz> yeay
[14:15:04] <ampzamp> can i pull text from a text file into a div? plugin? I'm using .load right now for pulling html page into div though just wanna fill a 1"x1" box with text and have some cool animation TO the actual text. possible?
[14:15:45] <RandalSchwartz> site went live with 1.4 to 1.6.1 now :)
[14:20:49] <M_ikeR> RandalSchwartz: congrats, man!
[14:20:58] <M_ikeR> way to fight software rot on the web
[14:21:24] <RandalSchwartz> well - there's still those broken tags, and a bunch of invalid html.
[14:21:33] <M_ikeR> go fix em ;)
[14:21:37] <RandalSchwartz> and I still need to see if jq-ui upgrade breaks anything.
[14:22:00] <M_ikeR> I'm still grepping my code for all the stuff djQuery pointed me at earlier
[14:22:32] <djQuery> for the most part 1.7 to 1.8 is ok but 1.9 is gonna have some pitfalls
[14:22:34] <tallisman> is there any way of including external javascript files in javascript? except document.write?
[14:23:06] <djQuery> tallisman: see ?.getscript
[14:23:07] <bot-t> tallisman, jQuery.getScript(url, [success]): Load a JavaScript file from the server using a GET HTTP request, then execute it. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getScript/
[14:23:23] <tallisman> thanks :D
[14:25:27] <tallisman> any clue how this is archieved without jquery :P? (I always like to know how things are done without libraries :P)
[14:25:55] <djQuery> ?source getscript

[14:32:37] <hye> i am using jsddm and nivo slider, for some reason on ie8 and earlier the menu goes behind the slider.
[14:32:37] <djQuery> M_ikeR: I think that is just where it backs up window.$ before it sets itself to window.$
[14:32:38] <hye> any ideas?
[14:32:52] <M_ikeR> oh
[14:32:59] <M_ikeR> I was just playing with the interface
[14:33:18] <M_ikeR> I"m asuming that shows the source for parts of the jquery lib
[14:33:22] <djQuery> bot-t.com has been down for a while
[14:33:46] <tallisman> yea, noticed that.. why actually?
[14:33:53] <tallisman> stopped developing it :P?
[14:33:53] <dtach> hi, i'm splitting up a string, now that its an array how can i do something with each of the entries, when the total amount of entries is dynamic? str[0] up to the max
[14:34:00] <djQuery> temp01 ^^^^^^^
[14:35:31] <djQuery> dtach: the way that you loop over any other array. or you can do $.each('1,2,3,4'.split(','), function(i, obj){  do something here });
[14:37:17] <dtach> djQuery: thanks :)
[14:41:08] <RandalSchwartz> is there any way to tell what "custom" means in a jquery-ui bundle?
[14:41:37] <RandalSchwartz> I think I just selected all
[14:41:41] <RandalSchwartz> I guess there's no harm in that :)
[14:41:48] <djQuery> RandalSchwartz: friendly file comparision tool to compare witha  stock one?
[14:42:36] <RandalSchwartz> I'm not sure how to make a stock one either
[14:43:06] <RandalSchwartz> ugh - should have written more notes when I rolled this out 2 years ago
[14:43:25] <djQuery> RandalSchwartz: http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jqueryui/1/themes/base/jquery-ui.css
[14:43:39] <djQuery> or just go to jquery ui and download it again
[14:43:52] <RandalSchwartz> I can get 1.7.2 still?
[14:44:18] <djQuery> RandalSchwartz: just replace the 1 with the version # u want
[14:44:24] <djQuery> http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jqueryui/1/themes/base/jquery-ui.css
[14:44:31] <RandalSchwartz> ahh - here's the files on my local disk
[14:44:36] <RandalSchwartz> let's see if I have any notes. :)
[14:44:59] <dtach> what would be the best way to then do something when the $.each is done (so reached it the max of the array)— would a var++ checked again .length be good enough?
[14:46:06] <djQuery> dtach: $.each('1,2,3,4'.split(','), function(i, obj){  do something here }); doSomethingElse();
[14:46:22] <RandalSchwartz> ahh - there's a URL in the css file to load exactly the same settings
[14:46:23] <RandalSchwartz> yeay
[14:46:24] <dtach> ah way better, thanks again
[14:47:15] <djQuery> hmmmm well that may not get you what you want if you only want it to fire if there was at least 1 thing done.
[14:47:17] <dtach> i was just afraid it would run the things i got after this or something
[14:47:34] <dtach> it should fire after it has processed all of the entries
[14:47:59] <djQuery> var dostuff = false $.each('1,2,3,4'.split(','), function(i, obj){  dostuff; do something here }); if(dostuff){ doSomethingElse();}
[14:48:38] <djQuery> dtach: rather      var dostuff = false $.each('1,2,3,4'.split(','), function(i, obj){  dostuff = true; do something here }); if(dostuff){ doSomethingElse();}
[14:48:56] <CIDIC> is there a way of keeping context inside a click event?
[14:49:52] <djQuery> cidic $('div').click(function(){    console.dir(this); this will be = to the div that was clicked   });
[14:50:27] <CIDIC> I understand that. I want it to be what it was outside of the $('div').click();
[14:51:48] <CIDIC> but I guess there is no good way to do it other than var that = this; before the click function

[14:55:38] <spirals> Is there a way to force a certain number of significant digits for axes ticks in jqplot? I'm having trouble getting tickOptions: {formatString: "%.3p"} to work.
[14:55:52] <CIDIC> I understand how 'this' works
[14:57:23] <fwaokda> how can i get my jquery code to execute befort my javascript code?
[15:04:01] <T-Gunn> $("MemberServiceIndustry").tick(function () should fire when i tick the check box, right?

[15:11:33] <jtannen1> not sure what I'm doing wrong here: http://paste.pound-python.org/show/8283/
[15:12:13] <RandalSchwartz> gah.  still trying to figure if my "custom" is the same (or at least an upgrade) to the other "custom" made by some other designer. :(
[15:12:13] <jtannen1> it's not working at all.. I also tried css("border","1")
[15:12:30] <M_ikeR> .css('border', '1px');
[15:12:35] <M_ikeR> try that
[15:12:48] <RandalSchwartz> this theming stuff still looks a bit magical to me
[15:13:17] <jtannen1> no, it remains border: 0 (as setup in a css file)
[15:13:21] <RandalSchwartz> if I just replace the main .js file, is the rest still likely to work, or did things get added that require a theme fix
[15:13:53] <M_ikeR> jtannen: try manipulating the style in firebug and set the border to 1 to make sure its not some css styling rule thats interfering
[15:15:46] <RandalSchwartz> anything I can read to help solve my query?
[15:16:09] <jtannen1> M_ikeR: I'm on chrome.. the chrome FireBug Lite can't seem to inspect my page
[15:16:44] <M_ikeR> jtannen1: chrome has a built in developer console that's pretty good
[15:16:52] <jtannen1> I can't change values in it
[15:16:56] <jtannen1> only un-set them
[15:17:24] <M_ikeR> I'm running chrome as we speak and I'm able to edit properties on the fly
[15:17:49] <M_ikeR> you have to double click
[15:17:56] <jtannen1> oh wow didn't know I could do that
[15:18:02] <M_ikeR> :)
[15:18:25] <jtannen1> I set the border to 1 and nothing went wrong
[15:18:53] <M_ikeR> 1px solid #f00
[15:19:59] <hye> anyone use nivo slider and have problems with their drop down menus going behind the slider?
[15:20:46] <hye> the z-index works fine in IE9 FF but anyting less than IE9. it screws up
[15:20:57] <jtannen1> I set it to that too, no problems..
[15:21:22] <jtannen1> this is the jquery I'm using: <script type="text/javascript" src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.6.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
[15:24:39] <M_ikeR> jtannen1: Do you have your event binding done in a document ready?
[15:25:04] <jtannen1> I don't think so, that might be the problem

[15:28:11] <djQuery> M_ikeR: hey I wrote that when I was jsut stating
[15:29:28] <djQuery> jtannen1: let paul irish school you in google chrome developer tools http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8SS-rUEZPg
[15:29:43] <djQuery> u can do anything that you can do in firebug
[15:30:12] <jtannen1> thanks
[15:30:21] <M_ikeR> djQuery: I dont understand what you mean
[15:30:22] <jtannen1> and M_ikeR it works now thank you
[15:30:29] <M_ikeR> Funhouse: i use boxy
[15:30:36] <M_ikeR> jtannen1: glad to help!

[15:32:07] <bot-t> djQuery, #7541 (getting [object Object] in my jaqueries ... - Bug Tracker - Opened 7 months ago http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/7541
[15:32:30] <Funhouse> M_ikeR, nice, I love it, does everything I need except one thing, if my page is 2000px high, and I am currently in the middle, it will not go the absolute positioning I specify
[15:33:01] <M_ikeR> Funhouse: me too. Every time I go to use it I forget the syntax though
[15:33:26] <M_ikeR> Funhouse: how are you calculating "middle"?
[15:33:31] <Funhouse> M_ikeR, ahh do you don't remember how?
[15:34:03] <Funhouse> I basically just want it to pop up in the middle of the screen no matter what, and it doesn't seem to position.
[15:35:19] <Funhouse> M_ikeR, http://pastebin.com/v5MgUhs2
[15:35:45] <M_ikeR> Funhouse: I always end up going here to find out how I want to invoke it: http://onehackoranother.com/projects/jquery/boxy/
[15:36:05] <M_ikeR> Funhouse: that's the problem, you're not taking the window height and width into account
[15:36:20] <Funhouse> Funhouse, I know, but even if I change the values it doesn't move.
[15:36:24] <Funhouse> M_ikeR, whoops
[15:36:44] <M_ikeR> Funhouse: take a look at this: http://www.queness.com/post/77/simple-jquery-modal-window-tutorial
[15:36:52] <M_ikeR> look at section 3
[15:37:33] <M_ikeR> there's some commented code in there taht you can lift to calculate the popup position while taking the browser window dimensions into account
[15:38:01] <Funhouse> M_ikeR very nice thank you. I will let you know after I've got it.
[15:38:08] <M_ikeR> cool, good luck!
[15:38:44] <djQuery> Funhouse: see ?ui.position
[15:38:44] <bot-t> Funhouse, Utility script for positioning any widget relative to the window, document, a particular element, or the cursor/mouse. Does not need ui.core.js or effects.core.js. http://jqueryui.com/demos/position/
[15:39:22] <djQuery> Funhouse: also see ?ui.dialog
[15:39:22] <bot-t> Funhouse, A dialog is a floating window that contains a title bar and a content area. The dialog window can be moved, resized and closed with the 'x' icon by default. http://jqueryui.com/demos/dialog/
[15:39:50] <Funhouse> Ah sweet very nice thank you djQuery
[15:40:24] <M_ikeR> Funhouse: it also looks like boxy might have a built-in function to handle this: http://onehackoranother.com/projects/jquery/boxy/  check out center(axis)
[15:43:31] <T-Gunn> $("<name of the check box>").tick(function () should fire when i tick the check box, right?
[15:44:59] <smik> Any jquery plugin for accessing webdav resource ?
[15:57:59] <Dev0n> is it possible to select by table cell value instead of looping through all cell values and comparing them ?
[15:59:28] <Dev0n> ahh .find
[16:01:36] <M_ikeR> Dev0n: try .children(selector)
[16:06:04] <Dev0n> M_ikeR, got it working fine with: var cell = $('tr', '#table').find('td:contains('+value+')');
[16:07:25] <M_ikeR> Dev0n: hope you don't have a lot of rows, that selector is going to do a lot of searching
[16:07:52] <Dev0n> hum, <10 rows, but is .children more efficient ?
[16:08:10] <M_ikeR> Devon: for < 10 rows I think you'll have no prob at all
[16:08:22] <M_ikeR> wasn't sure if you were going to run that on a like a 5k row table :)
[16:09:44] <hye> i wrapped all of my content in <div id="wrapper" style="display: none">  then I do the jquery .fadein on that div.  it fades in most objects, but not all, some images just show up without fading in, any suggestions?
[16:10:21] <dabear> ?p @ hye
[16:10:22] <bot-t> hye, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js or http://fixee.org/
[16:10:32] <Dev0n> heh, as know how, if it was 5k rows, I should use .children right M_ikeR  ?
[16:11:06] <dabear> Dev0n: you should never ever combine a value from the user, into a selector
[16:11:11] <hye> dabear http://paste.pocoo.org/show/414461/
[16:11:16] <M_ikeR> Dev0n: if it was 5k rows I'd say dont search by value
[16:11:24] <dabear> I assume the variable "value" there comes from some input the user does
[16:11:36] <Dev0n> it come from the db
[16:11:48] <Dev0n> which goes through all the sanitizations etc
[16:12:12] <dabear> you also sanitize it not to mess up the selector?
[16:12:30] <Dev0n> oooh never thought of that
[16:12:39] <Dev0n> the value is from a list of values though
[16:12:43] <Dev0n> not a direct user input
[16:12:48] <Dev0n> but I see what you mean now
[16:13:16] <Dev0n> is there a selectore escape fuction I should know of or is that my job XD ?
[16:13:21] <Dev0n> selector*
[16:13:44] <dabear> don't use any
[16:14:26] <dabear> but use .filter( function(){   return this.innerHTML.indexOf(value)+1;})
[16:15:07] <dabear> filter will ALWAYS be faster than a :contains selector
[16:17:06] <Dev0n> thx
[16:17:07] <rethus> i have this two arrays
[16:17:10] <rethus> http://pastebin.com/SHnjBPgU
[16:17:21] <macheleon> anyone have a recommendation for a lightweight lightbox plugin that does multiple levels? ie. yo dawg we put a a lightbox in your lightbox
[16:17:35] <rethus> how can i concat the array?
[16:17:45] <rethus> first array should be the key, second one the values
[16:18:36] <jtannen1> I can do ("td.dragHandle").mouseup(), but if I'm dragging the element, and my mouse leaves the element, and I mouseup, the mouseup function doesn't execute. Should I just set the function to (everything).mouseup(), and how would I do that?
[16:19:09] <jtannen1> er, should I just (everything).mouseup(function), not "set the function to blah"
[16:20:04] <dabear> rethus: in javascript, arrays always have numeric keys.
[16:20:29] <rethus> ah, thanks i forgot that
[16:20:57] <rethus> so i have to search in array 1 for my needed value... and then get the returned-key-value to array 2
[16:21:17] <rethus> no other way to do this?
[16:21:55] <dabear> you can have objects though
[16:22:19] <dabear> "hashmaps, associative arrays"
[16:22:51] <dabear> var foo = {bar: "baz", 1: 42, "2": 2}
[16:23:03] <dabear> foo.bar is now "baz"
[16:23:11] <dabear> foo[1] is 42
[16:26:47] <jtannen1> how would I get the last child of .children()?
[16:28:20] <dabear> ?last @ jtannen1
[16:28:21] <bot-t> jtannen1, .last(): Reduce the set of matched elements to the final one in the set. http://api.jquery.com/last/
[16:28:31] <dabear> obvious?^^
[16:28:40] <jtannen1> thanks.. new to JS in general
[16:29:01] <M_ikeR> dinner time, bbl. Nice meetin' all of ya! I dig my fellow jquery peeps
[16:31:13] <shesek> jtannen1, its not a good idea to start with jQuery right ahead. You should know how stuff works in the 'core' level first, otherwise you're pretty much treating jQuery as its own language with some voodoo magic that just works somehow magically
[16:31:16] <shesek> and that's bad
[16:33:03] <jtannen1> I know other languages (python is my strongest); so I know how to work with javascript as long as I know the formalities...
[16:34:26] <dabear> jtannen1: good. if you'd said php instead of python though, shesek's advice would still apply :p
[16:34:27] <rethus> dabear: how can i get my both arrays in such an object ?
[16:34:59] <shesek> dabear, why's that?
[16:35:02] <T-Gunn> does jquery have something similar to the popup window like in facebook when you send a new message?
[16:35:29] <dabear> rethus: don't know the best way to do that. a for loop over the first array and then pushing that into a new object with values from the second array  would work
[16:35:45] <shesek> T-Gunn, I
[16:35:58] <rethus> dabear: thanks. i'l have a look on it
[16:35:59] <shesek> T-Gunn, I'm not using Facebook myself, but I assume you should check jQuery UI's dialog
[16:36:36] <T-Gunn> ok, i did a quick google search and found somethign that will help me =D
[16:37:49] <shesek> T-Gunn, if its a 3rd party plugin that does that, I highly suggest you to check jQuery UI first
[16:38:17] <dabear> shesek: many more noobs in the php camp
[16:39:22] <T-Gunn> ok i will, thank you
[16:39:32] <shesek> dabear, :-(
[16:39:44] <shesek> but... I guess you are right
[16:39:54] <shesek> PHP does make it somewhat easier for 'noobs' to use it
[16:40:52] <shesek> But I still think knowing Python is no excuse to using jQuery without knowing Javascript
[16:40:57] <shesek> I've seen that ending badly too many times
[16:59:07] <thatryan> hey peoples
[16:59:48] <thatryan> I have a div near bottom of page, and a click elsewhere will toggle it to slide open, which just pushes the bottom of page lower, is there a way to have the page "slide down" with it as it opens?
[17:15:19] <dabear> thatryan: easiest would be to set a parent container to the new height of the child div
[17:18:52] <thatryan> how do you mean?
[17:23:28] <Jantire> How do I get the .toolbar to not cause the rest of the window to be shown - http://35d2.showoff.io user - sample_user@jantire.com pass - sample123
[17:23:36] <Jantire> It'll make more sense when you go to the page
[17:25:14] <Jantire> Anyone?
[17:25:47] <dabear> thatryan: if the div expanded is height 130, set the closest div parent to 130 in height before you do a slide down
[17:26:16] <dabear> Jantire: omg, passwords and stuff
[17:26:27] <dabear> neh, figure it out your self
[17:26:42] <thatryan> lol
[17:26:44] <dabear> i dont wanna mess with credentials
[17:26:46] <thatryan> also that link is broke
[17:29:23] <Jantire> it dies after 5 minutes
[17:46:29] <jtannen1> I have a <tbody> with three <tr>s as children, but $("tbody").children().size() keeps giving me 12
[17:46:34] <cirwin> jQuery.param({foo: null}) => "foo=null", how can I get it to not send parameters with null values?
[17:49:43] <Jantire> How do I get .toolbar to not show everything else when it is highlighted? http://h9n3.showoff.io (No Authenticatio nthis time)
[17:52:03] <thatryan> Jantire: could you explain more please?
[17:52:28] <thatryan> the toolbars on top and bottom i see are always there unless you are hovered on center.
[17:52:35] <Jantire> Try now
[17:52:43] <Jantire> er yeah
[17:52:45] <Jantire> That's what I mean
[17:53:01] <Jantire> The bold italic underline toolbar
[17:53:13] <Jantire> The user should be able to hover over that
[17:53:22] <Jantire> without the page going
[17:53:32] <Jantire> *without the page going back to the way it was
[17:53:58] <Jantire> http://1mfk.showoff.io
[17:54:06] <Jantire> (new link, showoff.io links expire after 5 minutes)

[17:57:37] <Jantire> If there was some gem that automatically turned a ruby link into a jsfiddle page that'd be awesome

[18:05:37] <emixam> hi, my question seems simple but in my case it doesn't work : i just want to write a text into a span tag. so i write $("span").text(variable); is this correct?
[18:08:39] <cirwin> that looks right
[18:08:43] <cirwin> so something else is wrong :p
[18:08:59] <emixam> ... of course ... always like that ^^
[18:09:19] <cirwin> does your span have a class-name you can use to access it instead?
[18:09:39] <emixam> i tried with a class and with an id.
[18:10:14] <cirwin> want to put your code into a pastebin?
[18:10:25] <emixam> hum... not sure xD
[18:10:54] <emixam> no, i'm gonna do it but i'm a little drunk so it asks me lot of effort, always prefer to ask if this is correct or no (began jquery today)
[18:12:05] <emixam> and now i'm trying to program a simple audio player using jplayer plugin. but, at this point i'm blocked because the "interface" disappear when i click on a track.
[18:12:59] <emixam> the fact is that i find that jquery is easy to use, but extremely annoying when not working.
[18:13:20] <emixam> doesn't give enough details.
[18:13:26] <cirwin> emixam: don't worry, after a few days you'll be able to work out why it's not working more quick;y
[18:13:44] <cirwin> things i often do are : console.log($('foo').length, $('foo').html())
[18:13:49] <cirwin> so that I can see what's wrong
[18:14:21] <emixam> o-O hummm, that's a nice method, console.log
[18:14:35] <emixam> means it will be more verbose in my console?
[18:16:15] <emixam> (first time i use firebug-like debugging console too ^^ - except at school but that was easier)
[18:18:24] <emixam> oh, it's fun, but not so verbose u_u
[18:23:16] <emixam> http://malade.mental.free.fr/randomedia/index_v2.php if you want to take a look. i turned off the play but it works (you can download the songs as well if you like them :p) the problem is, that my little upper-right red box disappears after i select a song (this box doesn't work yet, but why does it disappear??)
[18:34:08] <zouguo> emixam, the video is still there, but the inner text has been replaced. You can see it because it's width and height are all 0, so you can set some values to make it visible
[18:37:22] <emixam> zouguo: gonna try this.
[18:40:38] <emixam> hmmm, now it becomes a full black box when i click on a song.
[18:41:35] <emixam> the problem is jplayer. span is  OK.
[18:49:10] <bjhaid> hi, please I am a newbie to jquery, I am working on a rails project where I need to have two images load, when you hover on the first image produces the second image (this i have achieved with a method in rails) but I need the alternate image to be preloaded so once the user hovers on the original image the alternate image is available without an http request been sent
[18:50:29] <ryanneufeld> then set it as display:none in your CSS
[18:50:50] <ryanneufeld> and use a .hover() to set it display: block or display: inline-block
[18:52:29] <glen1> does anyone know how to animate something from 0% to 100% width then call another element to expand
[18:52:48] <ryanneufeld> the animations take a callback function
[18:52:54] <ryanneufeld> usually the last parameter
[18:53:01] <ryanneufeld> ?.animate @ glen1
[18:53:01] <bot-t> glen1, .animate(properties, [duration], [easing], [callback]): Perform a custom animation of a set of CSS properties. http://api.jquery.com/animate/
[18:53:36] <Tobsn> anyone an idea how i can turn a UTC timestamp into time passed in relation to the local browser time?
[18:54:27] <ktlr> there is too few widgets are supported by jquery ui
[18:56:16] <ryanneufeld> ktlr: They are very receptive to people wanting to help
[19:03:24] <ktlr> Somebody has already created widgets (extjs) , why not rewrite them, I think that is it is not easy to rewrite those components, however may be helpful
[19:04:00] <ryanneufeld> ktlr: go for it
[19:04:08] <ktlr> :)
[19:04:13] <ryanneufeld> jquery-ui isn't meant to be extjs
[19:04:24] <ryanneufeld> and honestly, if you've seen any of the stuff from extjs
[19:04:26] <ryanneufeld> it's huge
[19:04:37] <ryanneufeld> like in the MB of page load
[19:04:45] <ryanneufeld> and you pay for them
[19:05:00] <ryanneufeld> Plus, they're adding a few more
[19:05:07] <ryanneufeld> like a data table of some kind
[19:05:18] <ryanneufeld> I've seen demos, pretty cool stuff
[19:13:45] <emixam> hi, where do i put the << $("#button").click(function(){$("#jplay").jPLayer("play")}); >> and is it correct ? http://pastebin.com/GF6suFaD
[19:14:43] <ktlr> I didn't say that it will be an easy job or something else, and yes extjs is really very nice, the only problem is that it isn't free
[19:22:35] <fourcolors> hey i am using google chrome and would like to open a file_field with javascript but .click() doesn't work
[19:22:41] <fourcolors> is there a known method to do this?
[19:22:47] <cirwin> no
[19:22:54] <cirwin> it's for security
[19:23:16] <fourcolors> the reason im doing this is because I have an image that I want my user to be able to click on to upload a file
[19:23:29] <fourcolors> so when clicking the image, it opens the file_field
[19:23:53] <cirwin> you'd better be good with CSS then :)
[19:24:02] <cirwin> hvae to make the file upload field look like an image
[19:24:03] <fourcolors> so thats a css issue
[19:24:10] <cirwin> but I think they stop you from doing that too
[19:24:23] <fourcolors> thats dumb
[19:24:38] <cirwin> probably
[19:24:47] <fourcolors> http://imgur.com/ they seem to be doing it some how
[19:24:54] <fourcolors> so you can do it
[19:26:03] <cirwin> it's a styled form upload button
[19:26:40] <cirwin> actually that's quite a clever way to do it
[19:26:46] <cirwin> look at their page source
[19:27:38] <fourcolors> ok
[19:32:48] <sholmes> how do I create a new stylesheet in jQuery or the DOM?
[19:33:09] <sholmes> Not talking about editing an element's style, I'm talking about adding new rules to a stylesheet.
[19:33:38] <sholmes> not new rules to any stylesheet though, new rules to a newly created stylesheet.
[19:33:57] <sholmes> I've read online that there's a document.createStyleSheet property, but that's not working in chrome.
[19:34:42] <sholmes> Maybe jQuery already does this? Or, maybe you guys are knowledgeable enough to know how to do this in the DOM and in a cross-browser way?
[19:34:57] <cirwin> sholmes: there's a CSS-DOM api
[19:35:00] <cirwin> but it's not cross browser
[19:35:18] <cirwin> the easiest (and commonest afaik) way is to just create a new <style> and append it to the head
[19:38:52] <sholmes> cirwin: hmm, would I just do var s = document.createElement('style'); s.textContent = '.element { color: blue; }'; then append that to the head?
[19:39:04] <cirwin> yup
[19:39:13] <sholmes> Does that work cross-browser?
[19:40:50] <cirwin> yes
[19:41:19] <cirwin> function (text){var s=document.createElement('style');s.type='text/css';s.rel='stylesheet';if(s.styleSheet){s.styleSheet.cssText=text;}else{s.appendChild(document.createTextNode(text+''));}document.getElementsByTagName("head")[0].appendChild(s);return s.sheet||s;}
[19:41:22] <cirwin> wikipedia uses that
[19:43:15] <emixam> red wine very good to code jquery scripts.
[19:43:52] <emixam> and morning's beginning to come
[19:44:26] <sholmes> cirwin: I wonder why you need s.styleSheet.cssText, and not just s.textContent?
[19:44:38] <cirwin> not sure, I didn't write it :p
[19:45:17] <sholmes> seems like textContent is working fine on chrome. Maybe it's not as cross-browser, but I really only care about chrome. :P
[19:48:13] <miketaylr> textContent doesn't work in IE
[19:48:26] <miketaylr> but innerText does there
[19:50:35] <emixam> http://malade.mental.free.fr/randomedia/index_v2.php works or whut?!§~
[19:51:22] <emixam> little issues to correct but globally it seems to be well <3 thanks côtes du rhône!
[19:54:51] <miketaylr> you might want to remove that extra <!DOCTYPE html> in the <body>, emixam
[19:54:51] <miketaylr> :)
[20:00:37] <emixam> miketaylr > true =)
[20:04:35] <emixam> done. now audio tag encoding problems. shit.
[20:14:16] <innociv> What's the name of that plugin where you can have the background behind an element fade so that element comes in focus?  It's like modal, but no popup.
[20:14:17] <premapix> Does anyone know how to use live() to access nodes which were created after the initial DOM load? Our app needs to append to such nodes as soon as they are created.  What event should we bind to? Load?
[20:14:51] <innociv> bind to the callback that is inserting the elements
[20:15:39] <guy> how to call a function written in (function($) {}); from outside?
[20:15:45] <premapix> Thanks innociv -- do we have to get into the gallery code to do this or can we select the created node in some way?
[20:15:48] <cirwin> guy: you can't
[20:16:32] <innociv> In the gallery code
[20:17:02] <premapix> OK thanks very much we'll take a look
[20:22:48] <macheleon> anyone know of a lightbox plugin that does multiple levels? ie. a lightbox inside a lightbox?
[20:27:55] <cal2010> hey all, right now i run this line of code to convert all of my inputs with class='label' into combo boxes: $( "input.label" ).combobox();
[20:28:26] <cal2010> could anyone tell me how to just convert the ones within a div with id='someid'? thanks a lot
[20:28:41] <cal2010> i'm not used to jquery quite yet
[20:29:12] <cirwin> div#someid input.label
[20:29:13] <macheleon> cal2010: try $( "#someid input.label" ).combobox();
[20:29:14] <cirwin> just like CSS
[20:33:50] <cal2010> great! thanks macheleon & cirwin
[20:38:10] <innociv> macheleon, jQuery tools i think does
[20:44:00] <macheleon> thanks innociv, I'll look into that
[20:50:03] <Pinehead> How would i write a jquery to add css to a page that already exists without knowing what id's classes are available?
[20:50:11] <Pinehead> I'd like to add a floating item as a plugin
[20:57:35] <plov> hi, i have a bunch of thumbnails displayed, how would i be able to when a thumbnail is clicked to make that thumbnail take on a new id say #selected so i can stylize it with a border?
[21:00:52] <shesek> plov, you want to use a class, not id, and use element.addClass('active')
[21:01:23] <plov> how would i make the previous thumbnail that has been active unactive then?
[21:02:54] <shesek> plov, $('.thumbnail').click(funtion(){ $('.active).removeClass('active'); $(this).addClass('active'); });
[21:03:12] <plov> der! thanks
[21:24:47] <plov> i have another question, doing something like $('.thumbnails).click(function() { $('#full_image').fadeOut('slow', function() { $(this).attr('src',url); } ... then fadeIn, if someone spam clicks the thumbnails, it slowly fades everything they spammed
[21:25:15] <plov> how do i make it catch up? and not load like 50 different images if someone spams it and instead skips straight to the last one click if someone is spamming?
[21:25:44] <djQuery> plov: see .stop
[21:25:47] <djQuery> ?stop
[21:25:48] <bot-t> .stop([clearQueue], [jumpToEnd]): Stop the currently-running animation on the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/stop/
[21:25:54] <plov> ok thanks
[21:40:35] <abjorn> :o
[21:47:57] <macheleon> I can't believe I'm even thinking about paying for a lightbox
[21:48:19] <coldhead> you sick little monkey!
[21:48:24] <macheleon> I know :(
[21:48:54] <macheleon> last call: I need a lightbox plugin that can handle nested lightboxes with ajax
[21:49:14] <zmoazeni> Nested lightboxes?
[21:49:28] <zmoazeni> How would that even look, modal window inside modal window?
[21:49:34] <macheleon> yep
[21:49:50] <macheleon> I've used floatbox for it before and it worked great
[21:50:45] <macheleon> but alas, floatbox is not free .. or wasn't last time I checked
[21:50:48] <zmoazeni> I've never done modal-inside-modal before, but have you given http://jqueryui.com/demos/dialog a shot?
[21:51:36] <macheleon> yep and I have an example of a jqueryui modal within a modal, but don't you have to have the content already loaded in a hidden div?
[21:52:02] <nimbu> macheleon: have u actually used this modal within a model thing u speak of?
[21:52:07] <zmoazeni> Not necessarily, I think they even have a demo where they load the content via AJAX
[21:52:18] <nimbu> s/model/modal
[21:52:19] <macheleon> k zmoazeni I'll investigate that further
[21:52:28] <macheleon> nimbu: the floatbox one? yes
[21:52:54] <nimbu> macheleon: i would recommend u never do that in the interest of your users. One modal is confusing enough.
[21:53:13] <macheleon> from all the feedback we've gotten, users are loving it
[21:53:22] <nimbu> ?gl users
[21:53:40] <macheleon> I realise that it's not often done, and I do understand the guidelines of good design
[21:54:13] <zmoazeni> I'm with nimbu, modal-inside-modal sounds awkward. However if you check out the API docs, it's pretty straightfoward to fire up an HTML element as a dialog. You could even pull in the HTML by hand via jquery/ajax and then fire a call onSuccess
[21:55:56] <gf3> bad idea is bad
[21:56:03] <macheleon> while we're here, I don't -have- to do it this way, if you can suggest a better structure I'm all ears: say you have a client that deals with a bunch of organisations ... these orgs have parent companies, and they have main contact names and addresses
[21:56:42] <macheleon> so say the user has gotten a call from a prospective customer organisation and wants to enter their details quickly
[21:57:13] <macheleon> there are separate address book, organisation and parent org tables, and the forms populate from these
[21:57:58] <macheleon> so the user adds a new organisation, but when they get to contact name and parent organisation, they need to add those without leaving the form
[21:58:18] <macheleon> so one lightbox with a form and ajax should handle that easily
[21:58:23] <zmoazeni> You may have better luck with save-on-write fields. I don't know what the term is, but you click on text and it turns into editable text then they save it. If they have data they need to enter quickly and they don't want to go a full-form route that's an option. I don't have any jquery plugin links off the top of my head, but I'm sure googling will turn up something
[21:58:58] <coldhead> 90% if jQuery plugins are editable text plugins
[21:59:00] <coldhead> of*
[21:59:13] <zmoazeni> coldhead: heh right on
[21:59:59] <zmoazeni> As a user, I'm not a fan of modals. And if I'm going to encounter any, I rather only deal a few.
[22:00:00] <macheleon> I still need the ability to add a new contact and parent org within that form, or select existing ones
[22:00:22] <abjorn> coldhead mah nigga
[22:00:30] <macheleon> selecting existing is easy, just searchable dropdowns or similar
[22:01:11] <macheleon> but it'd be less db load if you only had to load the lists when the user needs them
[22:02:21] <iszak> oh I love refactoring a large application.
[22:06:05] <coldhead> macheleon: tabs within a modal? slightly more elegant?
[22:06:24] <macheleon> hmm
[22:06:54] <coldhead> hi abjorn
[22:06:59] <coldhead> i just read your blog post
[22:07:10] <abjorn> lol word
[22:07:12] <abjorn> it's not very interesting
[22:07:27] <coldhead> too late to tell me that now!
[22:07:32] <abjorn> hahaha
[22:07:45] <abjorn> I like to keep my blog updated, even if I don't have much to say
[22:07:52] <abjorn> otherwise I feel like it's just such a waste
[22:08:32] <coldhead> that's wise
[22:08:47] <coldhead> also when you are a ceo you can look back on your bright eyed innocence
[22:08:52] <abjorn> Plus it's good for appearances
[22:08:56] <abjorn> lol
[22:08:58] <abjorn> yeah
[22:08:58] <coldhead> and go "man i sure had fewer sexual harassmant suits then"
[22:09:05] <abjorn> roflmao
[22:09:16] <vladikoff> coldhead, ha
[22:09:23] <abjorn> does calling people fagets count as sexual harassment?
[22:09:30] <abjorn> cause if that's the case then I'm going to be having a looott
[22:11:06] <abjorn> I'm really bad about that word lol
[22:14:14] <coldhead> hopefully some faggots will beat the shit out of you for offending them
[22:14:29] <coldhead> and that will help you be a better person
[22:14:55] <macheleon> nothing like a good old fashioned beating to help you rethink things
[22:15:24] <abjorn> The ironic thing is that for most people I know "faggot" doesn't mean a derogatory term for homosexuals anymore. It's more or less saying "wow, what a loser" or "what a dick." But the gay people I know that do get mad at it...I end up thinking "Wow, what a faggot" for them getting so worked up over it lol
[22:15:39] <macheleon> haha
[22:16:02] <abjorn> I've only had a couple gay guys (literally, a couple) get mad at me over it, though
[22:16:10] <abjorn> every other gay person I've known has no problem with it
[22:16:48] <macheleon> same, some of my gay friends call themselves poofters and it's no biggie
[22:17:10] <abjorn> lol
[22:17:20] <macheleon> better to assimilate it as your own rather than fight it
[22:17:31] <abjorn> I'm waiting for the day gay people go "THAT'S OUR WORD. YOU CAN'T SAY IT"
[22:17:55] <abjorn> sup paul
[22:17:57] <macheleon> hehe yeah, like some coloured ppl have done with another word
[22:18:06] <abjorn> yeah that was what I was getting at lol
[22:18:29] <macheleon> ah see I'm banging my head on this structure and missing references
[22:18:34] <abjorn> ?
[22:18:39] <Circlefusion> Where do you the think the equation of faggot = shitty/loser/asshole/dick....came from? Do you not think it originated from people who felt negatively toward homosexuals? Do you not think that homosexuals experience being called that word today specifically because of their sexuality?
[22:18:53] <macheleon> ima make a chart of this and see if anyone wants to suggest a form structure
[22:19:13] <abjorn> Circlefusion: The point is that when people like me use it, unless in specific contexts, it has nothing to do with homosexuality.
[22:19:29] <coldhead> one good option is to not refer to other people by any word that has been used to oppress or marginalise sections of society, however well you mean it
[22:19:46] <abjorn> so basically make any and all conversation completely boring
[22:19:47] <macheleon> the problem is that some mean no harm, yet others do
[22:19:49] <abjorn> sounds rad
[22:19:55] <Circlefusion> Why use the term "faggot" then? If you simply mean to say "dick/loser/asshole" instead?
[22:19:58] <macheleon> *one problem
[22:20:00] <zmoazeni> abjorn: this best sums up my opinion about the work. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-55wC5dEnc&feature=player_embedded - from Louis CK's new show. Beware, this clip is pretty vulgar and super-NSFW
[22:20:04] <zmoazeni> *word
[22:20:10] <abjorn> lol yeah i love louis ck
[22:21:38] <paul_irish> abjorn: supppp
[22:22:01] <abjorn> zmoazeni: dick diamond lmfao
[22:23:27] <abjorn> nm paul_irish, wasting time before going to bed
[22:25:11] * coldhead np: the cure - young americans
[22:31:02] <abjorn> well fuck, im tired now
[22:31:07] <abjorn> night all
[22:31:10] <macheleon> so here's the structure of what I want to do:
[22:31:17] <macheleon> night abjorn
[22:31:20] <abjorn> sorry i couldn't say to help macheleon ;(
[22:31:31] <macheleon> nah that's fine abjorn, take care
[22:32:17] <macheleon> this isn't technically a jquery question on its own, but I'll be needing jquery to get it done .. http://www.agnosticality.com/client/strategic/Structure01.png
[22:32:17] <coldhead> you were useless anyway, abjorn
[22:32:27] <macheleon> haha now that he's not here to defend himself
[22:32:57] <coldhead> it would be great to have nimbu's input, macheleon, she's a UX high priest
[22:33:29] <coldhead> nimbu: ^^
[22:33:42] <macheleon> nimbu did help a while ago, saying I shouldn't use nested modals .. I'm cool with that if there's another option
[22:33:57] <paul_irish> nested modals is death
[22:34:03] <coldhead> hahah
[22:34:08] <macheleon> your tabs suggestion seems good but I'm not sure how to implement it
[22:34:23] <coldhead> ARE YOU BEGINNING TO SUSPECT NESTED MODALS ARE UNPOPULAR, MACHELEON
[22:34:23] <macheleon> so say user wants to add a new company
[22:34:28] <nimbu> i got it the first time coldhead but whats required again?
[22:34:33] <macheleon> hahah I'm getting an inkling
[22:35:05] <macheleon> in the new company form, if the company has a parent company, they'll need to add the parent and its contacts, as well as the company's contacts
[22:35:44] <coldhead> so you want to edit the attributes of entities which are arranged in parent-child hierarchies
[22:35:54] <macheleon> hey what a great way to word that.
[22:36:06] <coldhead> and you want to easily add a child entity from a parent entity's edit form
[22:36:27] <macheleon> more like add a parent entity from the child entity's form
[22:36:44] <macheleon> oh for the contacts, yes child, so going both ways
[22:37:42] <macheleon> hm one thing is missing ... they want the categories listed in the company form as well
[22:38:16] <macheleon> updated
[22:39:23] <macheleon> I'm pulling from all the right tables for display no problem, it's just being able to add / edit parents and children on the fly without page refresh
[22:41:13] <coldhead> i would do it with tabs
[22:41:29] <coldhead> there's probably a nicer pattern
[22:41:34] <macheleon> I think I'm starting to get my head around that idea
[22:41:35] <coldhead> but as a user tabs would make sense to me
[22:42:09] <coldhead> even if you nest tabs, it's still preferable to nesting modals
[22:42:28] <macheleon> yeah I'm over the nesting modals idea, I got the picture :D
[22:43:04] <coldhead> UX is hard
[22:43:14] <macheleon> I could just put the main form in the first tab, then one associated form in each subsequent tab
[22:43:32] <coldhead> right, that's how i was picturing it
[22:43:45] <macheleon> when each of the other forms is saved it ajaxes to the db, then when you return to the main tab, it ajaxes all data back out
[22:43:49] <coldhead> and a New Child control would visibly open a new blank tab
[22:43:57] <coldhead> and the parent is still accessible
[22:44:04] <coldhead> if i am still working on that
[22:44:54] <macheleon> I understand that using ajax with jquery is quite easy to learn
[22:45:13] <coldhead> you barely have to think about it
[22:45:16] <macheleon> that's one of the remaining areas of jquery that I didn't cover the other month
[22:46:25] <macheleon> I'm pretty sure I'll have to think about it :)
[22:46:36] <macheleon> I'm an allrounder and coding doesn't come naturally
[22:50:16] <macheleon> normally UX is quite easy and logical for me, just once in a while I fall over and thrash on the ground a bit
[22:56:05] <oxez> I have some code that needs to be run in an iframe, is it possible to call functions on the parent window from inside the iframe?
[22:57:05] <cirwin> oxez: yes, if they're on the same domain
[22:57:14] <cirwin> window.parent, or window.top
[22:58:00] <oxez> cirwin: yes they are -- awesome, thanks
[23:00:22] <coldhead> macheleon: i just mean jQuery's ajax stuff is nice and simple and mostly works in the ways you hope it would
[23:11:02] <coldhead> HERE'S THE TENDER COMING
[23:18:55] <gavin_huang> hi guys. I'd like to test if required attr has been set in an input in older browsers. however, $input.attr('required') returns undefined, whereas $input[0].hasAttribute('required'). So is it possible to test it in a jquery way?
[23:21:01] <coldhead> which jQuery version are you using, gavin_huang ?
[23:21:32] <gavin_huang> coldhead, it's 1.6.1
[23:22:03] <gavin_huang> *whereas $input[0].hasAttribute('required') returns true
[23:23:01] <coldhead> gavin_huang: http://jsfiddle.net/VrHHM/
[23:23:09] <coldhead> that works for me in chrome
[23:23:31] <coldhead> and in fx 3
[23:24:23] <coldhead> http://jsfiddle.net/VrHHM/1/ is more illustrative
[23:25:03] <innociv> Is there a way to blur elements, as in like a gausian blur, without canvas?
[23:25:21] <coldhead> maybe with IE filters, innociv
[23:25:32] <coldhead> but not across browsers that i know of
[23:26:20] <gavin_huang> coldhead, ah, it returns empty string. firebug reports it's undefined. strange. thank you very much. problem solved. :)
[23:26:23] <innociv> Is a shame.
[23:31:25] <coldhead> sorry innociv
[23:34:11] <oxez> cirwin: Doesn't seem to work. Do I just do something like window.parent.someFunction()?
[23:39:32] <oxez> cirwin: nvm.
[23:55:56] <Tobsn> someone still awake using jquery template?
[23:56:14] <Tobsn> if i use {{each}} the items end up at the end after the template not where i place them
[23:59:37] <coldhead> gnarf: you awakre buddy?
[23:59:42] <coldhead> awake*
