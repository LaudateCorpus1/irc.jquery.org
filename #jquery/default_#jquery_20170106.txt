[02:11:01] <biyectivo> hi, how can I get the text inside <a> </a> tags? I thought it was $(this).attr("text"), but that returns undefined.

[05:32:27] <pippuccio76> Hi , i want reset a input file on form , https://jsfiddle.net/a24ne5sf/ , why when i reset  reset i the entire form  ?
[05:39:02] <bdn> pippuccio76: what you want to happen?
[05:42:21] <pippuccio76> reset the row only without entire form

[06:36:47] <steveccc> is there a way you could add spans around lines of a paragraph - the spans would have to know where each line wrapped
[08:23:07] <printForever> hi!
[08:24:22] <printForever> I have a child (main menu) inside the parent (dark overlay). When I click on the parent I want to remove/hide all of it. But if I click on the child the jQuery is registering as if I clicked the parrent.
[08:24:28] <printForever> How to separate these two?
[08:25:47] <printForever> is there a way I can exclude triggering the parent
[08:33:13] <Arcarc> printForever: Paste the code here and someone will probably be able to help you: https://jsfiddle.net/

[10:17:36] <MACscr> are buttons not draggable?
[10:17:36] <MACscr> https://jsfiddle.net/mq3ycb0L/17/
[10:17:43] <MACscr> works fine as a div, but not as a button
[11:03:50] <MACscr> ok, i got them draggable https://jsfiddle.net/mq3ycb0L/18/
[11:04:18] <MACscr> but when i add resizable to them, they are then no longer draggable. lol
[11:06:09] <taplar> those two things can conflict since they both affect inline styling
[11:06:29] <MACscr> seems cancel:null should be needed on the resizable too, but doesnt seem to make a difference
[11:06:51] <MACscr> taplar they both seem to work on divs fine
[11:07:05] <taplar> *shrug* just know what i've seen in the past
[11:08:58] <MACscr> oops, i had a typo, but still broken, but at least doesnt throw an error anymore https://jsfiddle.net/mq3ycb0L/20/
[11:09:32] <MACscr> maybe i need to find another jquery plugin and simply the ui method doesnt work well for this
[11:17:33] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/mq3ycb0L/21/  cleaned it up a bit
[11:26:31] <MACscr> taplar im confused. you did it with a div. Im trying to resize/drag buttons and then eventually inputs.
[11:27:16] <taplar> i changed it to div so i could tell if i broke anything
[11:28:12] <MACscr> ah, so cleaned up ,but still not usable? =P
[11:28:33] <taplar> *shrug* why do you need to drag and resize buttons?
[11:29:36] <MACscr> im pretty much must making a small markup editor for buttons/inputs that overlay an image. This tool will just make it easier for me to create that markup instead of having to do all the absolute positioning and sizing by hand
[11:30:04] <taplar> UX stuff?
[11:31:45] <MACscr> yes, to improve time efficiency
[11:34:54] <taplar> have you tried any existing solutions?  like http://mockupbuilder.com/
[11:36:21] <MACscr> no. its commercial and im looking for something very specific that i can easily adapt to my needs
[11:36:45] <MACscr> being able to resize/drag a button shouldnt be that difficult
[11:37:44] <MACscr> maybe i need to put the elements in different modes. As in a resize mode and then a draggable mode
[11:37:47] <MACscr> so they dont conflict
[11:46:01] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/mq3ycb0L/22/
[11:46:30] <taplar> you may take a look at the resizable function to see if you can give it a starting width and height so the buttons aren't super small at the start
[11:52:10] <MACscr> taplar the problem there is that you created extra markup to accomplish it
[11:52:30] <taplar> why is that a problem?
[11:54:58] <MACscr> because its an editor and i wont want to change markup just to get it to work. hmm. i need to rethink this. its going to change markup no matter what
[11:55:58] <taplar> i thought you were making like a mockup tool.  not something that actually changed live code. ?
[13:24:51] <rashkov> I upgraded chrome recently and now when I go to my console and do something like $('body'), it prints an array that looks like [body] instead of printing out the dom element for body. Is this a recent change? I know my chrome version was old but not more than 6 months old. Finding this change to be pretty frustrating
[13:28:40] <taplar> what do you get if you do console.log(jQuery.fn.jquery) ?
[13:30:10] <rashkov> 3.1.1
[13:30:42] <alik> hello
[13:30:50] <taplar> huh, ok.  well i guess it is a chrome thing.  you can always do $('body').html() or prop('outerHTML')
[13:31:45] <shoky> $('body')[0]  ?
[13:31:47] <ngharo> jquery always returned a collection of elements for a selector ... ?
[13:31:59] <taplar> yes
[13:32:06] <ngharo> i dont recall chrome displaying it differently as of recently
[13:32:13] <taplar> it returns a jQuery object with an internal stack
[13:32:14] <shoky>  $ by default in chrome is  document.querySelector
[13:32:22] <shoky> unless jquery is included and overwrites it
[13:32:23] <alik> where can i get info about setting up jquery locally, and run test on each specific units
[13:32:43] <taplar> alik: test jquery or your own code?
[13:32:43] <alik> the purpose is to learn how to contribute
[13:32:53] <alik> test jquery repo
[13:33:16] <taplar> the website has a section on contributing, or you might hitup #jquery-dev to learn more
[13:33:24] <shoky> alik: here  https://github.com/jquery/jquery
[13:33:30] <rashkov> shoky: $('body')[0] does the trick, and chrome's default $ / document.querySelector gives exactly what I've come to expect from jquery, yeah
[13:33:44] <taplar> just use, document.body
[13:33:48] <taplar> no need for a selector
[13:34:08] <rashkov> well that was just an example, I'm usually not searching for the body tag but something much more specific
[13:34:16] <taplar> k
[13:34:55] <rashkov> usually I'll right click on it and do "reveal in elements panel". this new setup requires an extra click or two, just a bit frustrating but I suppose I'll get used to it
[13:35:07] <shoky> yeah i see what you mean
[13:35:43] <shoky> rashkov: actually you can now just left-click on  the `body` part
[13:35:57] <shoky> ah no, srory
[13:36:27] <alik> I actually forked it and cloned it locally and run "npm install" and "npm test" and everything works. What other repeating tasks I should know for continuos integration. Eg. how do I test the specific staff in test folder? how to test it on all browsers
[13:36:31] <shoky> well you can click on it once to expand , then click on the other `body` that appeared
[13:36:34] <rashkov> it does seem to work actually.. sometimes it expands the array first but then another click does the trick
[13:36:37] <rashkov> yeah
[13:36:47] <rashkov> it'll have to do
[13:36:57] <alik> that kind of info
[13:39:27] <rashkov> alik: "npm run test" might be what you're looking for
[14:41:29] <jackp10> hi everyone.. I managed to create a dynamic html element and appended to another element. The issue is that I need to clear the container in order to place the new content. 'appendTo' leave the original content there.
[14:41:59] <taplar> empty() will remove all the contents
[14:42:03] <jackp10> as I am loading a content that might take several seconds to load, I have a loading wheel and I want to remove it after the content is loaded
[14:43:36] <jackp10> right now i have $('<iframe>', {name: iframeIdentity, id: iframeIdentity, src: 'loadMyContent.html'}).appendTo('.content'). I tried to place .empty() before the appendTo, but it doesn't work
[14:43:43] <minikN> has anyone ever worked with this? https://github.com/VinceG/twitter-bootstrap-wizard
[14:44:10] <taplar> jackp10: you have to do empty on the content element, not the element you are appending to it
[14:44:31] <taplar> $('.content').empty().append( ... )
[14:47:41] <jackp10> taplar, the problem with that is that the loading wheel is embedded in the html and if I empty it as you suggested and then loading the content, the wheel disappear as soon as the modal opens and then the content loads after x seconds
[14:48:33] <taplar> oh
[14:48:52] <taplar> is the iframe to the same domain as the parent?
[14:49:03] <jackp10> yes
[14:49:31] <taplar> then what you can try to do is bind a load event handler to the iframe element, and inside it, hide the loading wheel
[14:51:35] <jackp10> yes that is a solution, although i was trying to tide up everything within that function for portability purposes, without relying on additional code written elsewhere. If I run out of options, that is indeed a solution
[14:52:02] <taplar> other than the load event, i'm not sure how you are going to know when the iframe has done loading
[14:52:41] <jackp10> it would have been great to have something like .appendTo('.container').empty('.loadingWheelWrapper');
[14:53:01] <taplar> but you said you want to remove it when the iframe loads
[14:53:05] <taplar> which is an async event
[14:53:35] <jackp10> correct.
[14:58:06] <quechon> hello people
[15:00:20] <taplar> bonjour
[15:03:41] <quechon> i have a ajax get call when a user request a home page retrieveing data when DOM is ready now at the same time i would like to create a ajax post so the user can post some more data in that page
[15:04:22] <quechon> how can i make the ajax post take over
[15:04:41] <taplar> you want to cancel the get and perform the post?
[15:05:46] <quechon> yes because when i do the post the get data still remains in the browser i would like tge get data to go away and let post handle everything from there
[15:06:37] <taplar> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/446594/abort-ajax-requests-using-jquery
[15:09:03] <Arcarc> So I've learned how to send Ajax data to a server
[15:09:23] <Arcarc> How do I become the server? I.e. how do I listen for Ajax data and act upon it
[15:09:42] <Arcarc> Google is incredibly unhelpful -- don't even know where to start
[15:09:42] <taplar> you don't.  the server handles it like any other request
[15:10:08] <Arcarc> I just bought a Raspberry Pi to act as a web server
[15:10:14] <Arcarc> I don't know how to handle it like any other request
[15:10:34] <taplar> oh, then you're going to have to put a server on it, if you don't want to write your own
[15:11:23] <quechon> taplar what framework do you use (server)
[15:11:51] <taplar> my hosting server is probably apache
[15:11:57] <Arcarc> I have Apache up and running, but I just want to run Javascript code based on what data I send to it
[15:11:58] <taplar> for work we use tomcat
[15:12:18] <taplar> Arcarc: then you might see if you can put a nodejs server on the pi
[15:12:30] <taplar> because otherwise, you don't make ajax request to other webpages
[15:13:24] <taplar> you say you have apache running on the pi?
[15:13:26] <Arcarc> Oh, if nodejs permits that, that would be right down my alley
[15:13:31] <Arcarc> taplar: Yeah
[15:14:01] <taplar> do you have php or anything on it?
[15:14:24] <Arcarc> Hmmm, I haven't manually installed PHP at least -- not sure what is installed already
[15:14:59] <Arcarc> Anyway, to outline the problem as succinctly as possible:
[15:15:06] <taplar> well if you got php on it you could definitely handle the requests with that.  otherwise you could try the nodejs option.  i'm not familiar with how big nodejs is or the confines of pi
[15:15:29] <quechon> how about flask??
[15:15:34] <Arcarc> I have a website where I can configure my Philips Hue lights in my home, but it only works on LAN
[15:15:45] <Arcarc> So I want the Raspberry Pi to act as an intermediary when I'm not at home
[15:16:03] <Arcarc> Sounds simple enough, so if there's a solution that isn't overly complicated, I'll take it
[15:17:07] <taplar> http://weworkweplay.com/play/raspberry-pi-nodejs/
[15:17:23] <taplar> from a quick google search
[15:17:31] <taplar> quechon: i'm not familiar with flask
[15:18:12] <taplar> http://flask.pocoo.org/ this?
[15:18:27] <Arcarc> taplar: Aye thanks, I'll definitely check out NodeJS and see if it's an apt solution!
[15:19:23] <quechon> flask is lightweight framework but it needs python so dont know if it would work in a PI
[15:19:53] <taplar> it most likely has a linux flavor on it
[15:20:45] <quechon> yea i love good for beginners
[17:14:17] <duch_kazatel> weeeeeeee
[17:34:14] <carpii> Migrating my site to https, and trying to flag up any rogue images which are still using http://.  Is there a way I can rewrite image urls prior to them being requested by browser?
[17:51:48] <ilhami> duch_kazatel, weee
[17:51:49] <ilhami> :D
[18:14:56] <samsamek> Hi all, is it possible to to use jquery UI for it’s functionality only, without using any of its styling?
[18:15:40] <samsamek> I’m specificaly interested in the sortable functionality (drag n drop sorting)
[18:21:57] <duch_kazatel> samsamek you can define your own CSS if you'd like.
[18:22:05] <duch_kazatel> you just omit the css files.
[18:23:06] <samsamek> I see.. But I’m just not sure about the scope of jquery, I thought it’s a barebone JS functionality framework
[18:23:27] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[18:23:35] <duch_kazatel> jquery and jquery ui are not the same thing.
[18:23:50] <duch_kazatel> jquery is just a DOM abstraction library.
[18:24:50] <samsamek> I’m aware of the idea behind jquery, I’m just not sure why jquery UI comes with a load of css styling and “themes”
[18:25:22] <duch_kazatel> because that's the job it's built to do.
[18:25:26] <samsamek> I just want to implement drag-n-drop sorting functionality, using jquery UI, but all the CSS and mentioning of ‘themes’ here and there kind of frightens me about style conflicts
[18:25:33] <duch_kazatel> kind of like with bootstrap.
[18:25:37] <samsamek> aah
[18:25:45] <duch_kazatel> you can simply not use the CSS and roll your own.
[18:25:53] <duch_kazatel> iirc the docs explain how to do exactly that.
[18:25:57] <samsamek> going to give it a try =]
[18:26:10] <duch_kazatel> are you already using something else?
[18:27:15] <samsamek> duch_kazatel: I tried this one, it was painfully buggy: https://github.com/RubaXa/Sortable
[18:27:31] <duch_kazatel> i mean are you using any other frameworks or libraries?
[18:27:40] <duch_kazatel> and what was so buggy with that sortable dealio.
[18:28:13] <samsamek> I’m using SilverStripe CMS, which has some jquery and concrete.js (aka entwine)
[18:28:32] <samsamek> rest is all custom stuff
[18:28:41] <samsamek> It’s all so messy, I should write my own
[18:29:04] <duch_kazatel> fair enough.
[18:29:33] <duch_kazatel> i was gonna say, if you've already got like bootstrap or something go with that.
[18:29:50] <duch_kazatel> you can also do a custom build of JQUI with just the components that you need.
[18:31:34] <samsamek> yeah I noticed that, first going to give this a try: https://bevacqua.github.io/dragula/
[18:31:36] <samsamek> looks promising :p
[18:32:28] <duch_kazatel> rad
[18:36:09] <carpii> samsamek: you are very unlikely to get css conflicts with jquery ui since it uses prefixes
[18:36:26] <carpii> but if youre ultra paranoid, then use jquery ui themeroller and roll your own theme with your own prefixes
[18:36:31] <duch_kazatel> that't not the only way things can conflict fwiw.
[18:36:39] <samsamek> prefixes?
[18:36:46] <samsamek> oh
[18:36:51] <samsamek> I see
[18:36:52] <carpii> no duch?
[18:37:07] <duch_kazatel> positioning and floats and things can break things unexpectedly, too.
[18:37:29] <duch_kazatel> interaction between things can also be conflicts.
[18:37:32] <duch_kazatel> etc
[18:37:32] <samsamek> Yes, I’m also worried about to what extend it’s styling my elements
[18:37:43] <carpii> you mean styles that are set at runtime by jquery UI ?
[18:37:53] <duch_kazatel> basically.
[18:37:57] <duch_kazatel> that stuff happens.
[18:38:19] <samsamek> Is it going to place arrows in my elements for sortable elements? Is it going to adjust sizes of stuff? float stuff around? position absolute
[18:38:24] <carpii> yeah fair enough. I was just addressing his concerns about the stylesheets specifically
[18:38:47] <duch_kazatel> samsamek it'll try to only impact the specific things you use.
[18:39:00] <duch_kazatel> like, jqui doesn't try to modify anything outside of the widgets you're using.
[18:39:44] <carpii> samsamek, i tried to integrate jquery UI but found it quite restrictive. Instead I opted for jqwidgets, so you could consider that too
[18:39:48] <carpii> although its by no means perfect
[18:39:56] <carpii> http://www.jqwidgets.com/
[18:40:49] <samsamek> whoah, those prices tho
[18:41:02] <duch_kazatel> heh
[18:41:40] <carpii> sam, ahh yeah I bought it. I didnt see it as being expensive for what it offered
[18:41:46] <carpii> but yeah, i forgot it wasnt free
[18:42:22] <samsamek> interesting to try out though
[18:42:32] <samsamek> so imagine I just need drag-n-drop sorting
[18:43:02] <samsamek> what would make jqwidgets than jquery ui better in your opinion?
[18:44:17] <duch_kazatel> things like jqwidgets/jqui are really meant to be used pretty extensively imo.
[18:44:21] <duch_kazatel> full buy-in and that.
[18:45:04] <samsamek> yeah, I could imagine that, with all that code sitting there
[18:57:52] <carpii> samsamek, I found jquery UI difficult to style visually even with its theme roller, but also in my case when a drop down list would extend beyond the bounds of the document, jQuery UI makes no attempt to display it 'above' like a native control does. It just shows the list and allows it to get clipped
[18:58:16] <carpii> nich requirements maybe, but for me its why I ended up using jqWidgets
[18:58:20] <carpii> niche
[19:01:59] <duch_kazatel> heh
[19:02:08] <duch_kazatel> ever submit a bug for that?
[19:02:40] <carpii> nop, it was just one example of why i didnt use jquery ui
[19:02:52] <carpii> i figured its so obvious i cant be the only person who found it, so it must be intentional :p
[19:02:52] <duch_kazatel> heh
[19:02:59] <carpii> also i couldnt be bothered heh
[19:03:00] <duch_kazatel> errr.
[19:03:01] <duch_kazatel> lol
[19:03:32] <duch_kazatel> that's part of the major difference - when using OSS for stuff part of the social contract is that you'll submit bugs as you find them.
[19:05:46] <carpii> yeah i agree, i normally do to be fair, but jquery ui was so way off the mark for what i needed
[19:06:06] <carpii> there comes a point where you just accept its not for you
[19:06:13] <duch_kazatel> heh
[19:21:38] <kevr> i'm using jquery.panelSnap, and it works great on my linux laptop, but on a macbook air in chrome for some reason it takes a few seconds for panelSnap's event to fire
[19:21:41] <kevr> does anybody know why?
[19:22:35] <duch_kazatel> we'd have to see it.
[19:32:34] <kevr> see what, the whole website?
[19:32:38] <kevr> or the related code
[19:37:17] <carpii> an example of whats not working for you
[19:37:23] <carpii> so we can reproduce it
[19:37:47] <duch_kazatel> basiocally.
[19:37:56] <duch_kazatel> a test case.  like on jsfiddle or something.
[19:48:51] <kevr> i'm not sure how to link jquery plugins on jsfiddle though
[19:48:53] <kevr> they dont seem to carry over from <script> tags
[19:48:59] <kevr> however, i think i've figured out why; i think on mac the scrolling just takes longer to settle than on my current computer so it takes longer to snap
[19:49:18] <duch_kazatel> the left-hand-side
[19:49:22] <duch_kazatel> "external resources"
[19:50:04] <duch_kazatel> and aaah.  yeah that smooth scrolling stuff can kill those handlers.
[19:53:02] <kevr> dammit.
[19:53:12] <kevr> is there a way to tell the browser to not scroll smoothly?
[19:53:31] <duch_kazatel> afaik not without the user changing settings.
[19:53:36] <duch_kazatel> that's a strange scroll hijack fwiw.
[19:53:43] <duch_kazatel> most do it when the scroll starts.
[19:53:44] <duch_kazatel> not ends.
[19:54:25] <duch_kazatel> though those kinds of plugins are generally something to avoid imo
[19:55:53] <kevr> i see.
[19:56:14] <kevr> basically
[19:56:37] <kevr> i have a website that has a bunch of full-view sections, with 100vh height, and i want it to be like flipping through sections of the webpage
[19:56:48] <kevr> so i used panelSnap for that, and it works great without smooth scrolling
[19:56:51] <kevr> would you suggest another method?
[19:57:04] <duch_kazatel> i'd suggest either not doing it at all or going with another plugin.
[19:57:12] <duch_kazatel> since it's not really meeting your needs :)
[19:57:15] <kevr> ic. alright, thank you
[21:44:03] <carpii> I need to rewrite all image urls using jquery (changing http:// or https:// to //). Whats the best approach to this?
