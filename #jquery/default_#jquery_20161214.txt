[03:58:36] <jkavalik> hello
[03:59:31] <jkavalik> might anyone suggest a way to turn jquery animation to gif (or just a list of frames)?
[04:45:55] <jquery148> Hi. how to close outside this div to close it ---> https://jsfiddle.net/3bmm8df4/
[04:47:07] <jquery148> function is working. But also want to close this div when clicking outside this div
[04:47:11] <ilhami> you gotta love jquery :p
[04:47:27] <ilhami> best DOM manipulation library ever.
[04:55:34] <jquery148> got it ---> https://jsfiddle.net/3bmm8df4/1/
[04:59:03] <Cork> jquery148: i would recommend doing https://jsfiddle.net/3bmm8df4/2/
[04:59:31] <Cork> it removes the need for e.stopPropagaion() that you should avoid like the plague
[05:30:32] <km4> you guys use parseInt or now onlu Number ?
[05:40:11] <ilhami> is it fine to use contextmenus?
[05:42:08] <stennowork> good day, in my css i have set height: 0; for an element. however, jquery $(element).css("height") returns the value including the padding-top. how can i get the intrinsic height of an element without padding or margin?
[05:42:23] <stennowork> box-sizing is border-box if that matters
[05:43:07] <TotallyNotKim> .height() ?
[05:43:43] <TotallyNotKim> oh wait
[05:43:47] <TotallyNotKim> that includes padding too
[05:43:55] <stennowork> height() reports -0.00012500000002546585 lol
[05:44:01] <TotallyNotKim> but well the paddings is part of the height
[05:44:15] <stennowork> if i set height: 0, i need a 0 somewhere
[05:45:13] <TotallyNotKim> mhmmm
[05:45:14] <TotallyNotKim> http://www.texelate.co.uk/blog/post/91-jquery-whats-the-difference-between-height-innerheight-and-outerheight/
[05:45:27] <TotallyNotKim> let me test real quick
[05:46:03] <stennowork> that height() value looks like floating point arithmetics fail
[05:47:11] <stennowork> i get 0 sometimes with height(), but also _almost_ 0
[05:47:20] <stennowork> maybe i should just floor the value and take that one
[05:47:30] <TotallyNotKim> no
[05:47:32] <TotallyNotKim> dont do that
[05:47:49] <TotallyNotKim> thats just asking for bugs
[05:47:53] <TotallyNotKim> give me a second
[05:48:25] <stennowork> i am pretty sure the height will either be a 200+px value or 0
[05:48:57] <TotallyNotKim> until you change something 2 years from know and dont remember
[05:49:49] <stennowork> i don't see another way to work around floating point arithmetic
[05:50:24] <TotallyNotKim> for god sake would you just wait a minute. I'm testing the different solutions RIGHT NOW
[05:50:36] <TotallyNotKim> i cant just write as fast as my hands let me
[05:50:40] <TotallyNotKim> can*
[06:01:54] <stennowork> ok
[06:30:16] <TotallyNotKim> sorry
[06:30:24] <TotallyNotKim> forgot to press enter >.<
[06:30:28] <TotallyNotKim> https://jsfiddle.net/zn1heaxv/
[06:30:44] <TotallyNotKim> that should give you a qucik overview
[06:31:20] <TotallyNotKim> if you get a float you used percentages or similar I would say
[06:32:57] <TotallyNotKim> with outerheight(true) https://jsfiddle.net/zn1heaxv/1/
[08:18:21] <dglambert> yo
[08:23:41] <TotallyNotKim> o7
[08:28:57] <snfgf> HEY
[08:29:35] <snfgf> $('div')[0].html(), should get the content of the first div on the page, right?
[08:34:28] <shoky> snfgf: no.  $('div').first().html()   or $('div').eq(0).html()
[08:34:44] <jkavalik> snfgf, is $('div')[0] jquery object? afaik not, so no html() defined on it
[08:34:47] <shoky> [0] would get you the raw dom element
[08:35:43] <snfgf> thanks
[08:35:52] <snfgf> how about $('div').get(0).html()?
[08:37:19] <jkavalik> $($('div')[0]).html() if you want it to be very ugly
[08:37:37] <jkavalik> first() sounds better than get(0) if you want the first one
[08:38:34] <AdamPDotty> you might mix up .first and :first though
[08:41:30] <shoky> .get(0) is same as [0]
[10:25:58] <ircplayer> hi guy
[10:26:21] <cjohnson> snfgf: .eq(0) is like .get(0) but it returns a jquery object instead of the raw dom element
[10:26:29] <ircplayer> I want to create a scrollable area with a size of three pictures
[10:26:32] <ircplayer> https://jsbin.com/bahotahexu/1/edit?html,css,js,output
[10:26:58] <ircplayer> I have done something like this just in order to show you what i want to do. But the problem is for the last item
[10:27:33] <ircplayer> when i slide out the space (here 100px) remain
[10:29:29] <ircplayer> https://jsbin.com/bahotahexu/edit?html,css,js,output
[10:29:59] <ircplayer> I know that I could use full jquery but at the start I only want to use css3 animation but I couldn't find a solution to anumate properlu
[10:31:26] <ircplayer> sorry I share bad version latest is this one : https://jsbin.com/bahotahexu/edit?html,css,js,output
[10:32:18] <ircplayer> The issue is for the last element.
[10:32:32] <ircplayer> I want to remove the free space
[10:33:49] <ircplayer> One solution could be to add a listener and when the animation is over apply display:none
[10:34:05] <ircplayer> But it's kinda dirty cause it will brutally slide
[10:41:28] <printForever> Guys... I'm looking for some help.
[10:42:04] <printForever> I have a variable with property
[10:42:14] <printForever> newNiceVar.coolProperty
[10:42:30] <printForever> How can I insert DIFFERENT variable in between those two?
[10:42:53] <printForever> so it would become newNiceVar.DIFFVAR.coolProperty
[10:42:56] <printForever> I tried with +
[10:43:00] <printForever> but it didn't work
[10:43:06] <shoky> properties are not variables
[10:43:13] <printForever> I know Shoky.
[10:43:16] <shoky> a property value can be an object
[10:43:20] <shoky> then you can have nested properties
[10:43:20] <printForever> OK
[10:43:26] <printForever> I have them nested...
[10:43:31] <printForever> But I'm getting it from a var.
[10:43:46] <shoky> the property name?
[10:43:49] <printForever> newNiceVar is a multi array
[10:44:04] <shoky> maybe you want to use []
[10:44:13] <printForever> the full command is newNiceVar.en.coolProperty
[10:44:22] <shoky> newNiceVar[language].coolProperty
[10:44:31] <printForever> I'm getting the EN part from $('html').attr('lang');
[10:45:04] <printForever> so I can use newNiceVar[$('html').attr('lang');].coolProperty?
[10:45:31] <shoky> var lang = $('html').attr('lang');   newNiceVar[lang].coolProperty
[10:45:47] <printForever> shoky, thank you
[10:45:51] <printForever> do I need to put the dot?
[10:45:57] <printForever> newNiceVar.[lang]?
[10:46:09] <shoky> you need to do what i said ;)
[10:46:12] <printForever> OK.
[10:46:15] <printForever> Stupid question.
[10:46:20] <printForever> Why DON'T I need the dot?
[10:46:29] <printForever> Because in my logic, which is flawed, I think I do.
[10:46:31] <shoky> there are 2 ways to access properties of an object
[10:46:33] <shoky> either with a dot
[10:46:35] <shoky> or with []
[10:46:57] <shoky> [] is more flexible (allows you to use a variable, and allows more characters than dot-access would allow)
[10:47:08] <printForever> THANK YOU SHOKY!
[10:47:12] <shoky> ;)
[10:47:12] <printForever> Now I truly get it.
[10:49:23] <ircplayer> someone ?
[10:49:31] <ircplayer> https://jsbin.com/bahotahexu/edit?html,css,js,output
[10:49:43] <ircplayer> To remove the empty space when I click on the last element.
[10:50:01] <ircplayer> I know the code is kinda dirty (mixin css, jquery js)
[10:50:14] <ircplayer> If someone just have an idea
[10:59:12] <MassDebates> ircplayer:  what is it that you're having trouble with?
[10:59:18] <Mo0O> hi there, I'm trying to overrite a jquery function method, with no luck, do you think it's possible? I've try this: https://jsfiddle.net/d1boLfc4/
[10:59:49] <ircplayer> MassDebates: https://jsbin.com/yeqavucori/edit?html,css,js,console,output
[11:00:13] <ircplayer> If you prefer full jquery but I want to animate like this version https://jsbin.com/bahotahexu/edit?html,css,js,output
[11:00:34] <MassDebates> The developer put in a usage script
[11:00:34] <ircplayer> MassDebates: When I click on the last element and slide out, free space remain I want to remove
[11:00:37] <MassDebates> Woops, wrong channel.
[11:00:55] <MassDebates> free space remain you want to remove?
[11:01:34] <ircplayer> When I slide out the last element
[11:01:58] <ircplayer> for the second version (with css) the space remains
[11:02:33] <MassDebates> If someone can help you communicate to me what is the problem, I'm sure i can help. THis looks like pretty basic stuff but I still have no idea what your goal is.
[11:03:25] <ircplayer> MassDebates I try to explain to you in a simple way
[11:03:37] <ircplayer> But you seems to doesn't understand what I want..
[11:03:49] <ircplayer> https://jsbin.com/bahotahexu/edit?html,css,js,output
[11:04:02] <ircplayer> if you go to this link, click on the last image
[11:04:17] <ircplayer> You got a problem when you click a second time to hide content
[11:04:18] <Mo0O> maybe you don't like jsfiddle :$
[11:04:21] <MassDebates> It expands.
[11:04:32] <MassDebates> Ah
[11:04:37] <MassDebates> I see now
[11:04:48] <MassDebates> First off, I fucking hate jsbin nowadays.
[11:04:51] <MassDebates> 2 secs.
[11:05:22] <Mo0O> thx
[11:05:26] <ircplayer> Ok
[11:05:43] <Mo0O> hope I've well explain my problem
[11:07:35] <MassDebates> Okay
[11:07:47] <MassDebates> ircplayer:  Couple things
[11:08:03] <MassDebates> 1) I would suggest you put in an internal wrapper to control the sizing of things. It may be useful for you later.
[11:08:54] <MassDebates> 2) Do you absolutely need a scrollable container like this? Modifying the contents with js in this manner of an overflowed element with scroll will make your life diffiuclt with CSS.
[11:09:03] <ircplayer> MassDebates: the code is quite dirty I made another one with full jquery
[11:09:09] <MassDebates> Show me
[11:09:21] <MassDebates> Because you'll need to reapply the styles.
[11:10:28] <MassDebates> And don't do an animation. use transitions. You're transitioning.
[11:10:39] <ircplayer> https://jsbin.com/yeqavucori/edit?html,css,js,console,output
[11:10:51] <ircplayer> I just display none and display block not animate
[11:11:05] <MassDebates> Yes, display can't be animated or transitioned normally.
[11:11:15] <ircplayer> i know It's quite simple I just want some advice to do in a clean way
[11:11:23] <MassDebates> Oh okay
[11:11:27] <MassDebates> Hmm, what I suggest is
[11:11:38] <MassDebates> You can do a couple things
[11:11:58] <MassDebates> your original plan would be complete if you forced the browser to repaint the scrollable div.
[11:12:03] <MassDebates> (The container with the scrollbars)
[11:12:31] <MassDebates> Here's what I'd do.
[11:12:52] <MassDebates> 1) Clean up your transitions first. Make them transitioned #CSS Styles. DOn't make them animations.
[11:12:57] <MassDebates> https://jsbin.com/bahotahexu/edit?html,css,js,output Start here.
[11:13:42] <MassDebates> After you get your slide-in and slideout transitions going well, (Remember, get rid of the damned animations! :P) Then I would take care of my issue with the scrollable container by doing a retroactive "display:none" style after the transition.
[11:13:46] <MassDebates> In other words: Fade THEN fix.
[11:13:57] <MassDebates> That's the easiest solution, but not the best.
[11:14:58] <MassDebates> The best solution (best referring to quality after you're done) would be more-closely managing the container and creating your own scrollbar, using jquery to move the internally wrapped content as you need it. Things will be able to expand and contract the way you want them to
[11:15:35] <MassDebates> The reaosn why that's the best decision is because right now you're sortof in this half-crack spot where you're half-leaning on the browser to take care of the container for you and you're half-leaning on jquery to drive some changes that you hope the browser will respond well to.
[11:16:01] <MassDebates> Such circumnstances will give you a nightmare for some browsers, like Internet Explorer and Windows phone browsers.
[11:16:22] <MassDebates> The quick solution will take care of these issues, but it won't be the cleanest effect you ever did see.
[11:16:57] <MassDebates> The best solution will be more involved and take significantly more time (dependent on your familiarity with jq) but will provide you clean effects that look professional and polished.
[11:17:02] <hongkongphooey> why do the Ajax Global Event Handlers have to be attached to the document? why can't i juse do $.ajaxError() for example, it has to be $(document).ajaxError()
[11:17:16] <MassDebates> Advise you determine the LFV of the completed effect, but before you do anything - FIX YOUR TRANSITIONS
[11:17:22] <MassDebates> After that, FIX YOUR JQUERY.
[11:17:38] <ircplayer> MassDebates I will go from the jquery version
[11:17:50] <MassDebates> targetDiv.setAttribute('class', isOpen ? 'slide-out' : 'slide-in'); THIS IS NOT HOW YOU APPLY A CLASS IN JQUERY>
[11:18:00] <ircplayer> I know
[11:18:01] <MassDebates> ircplayer:  You're not getting my point though.
[11:18:08] <ircplayer> MassDebates: https://jsbin.com/yeqavucori/edit?html,css,js,console,output
[11:18:13] <MassDebates> My point is that you need a hybrid version between the two.
[11:18:15] <ircplayer> from this one, not use nativ js
[11:18:20] <MassDebates> The order of effects should be as follows:
[11:18:26] <MassDebates> 1) User clicks Picker.
[11:18:30] <MassDebates> Picture*
[11:18:38] <MassDebates> 2) User sees content expand out
[11:18:51] <MassDebates> 3) User clicks picture again
[11:19:11] <MassDebates> 4) User sees content contract (but the container sitll has the extra space there, even though you're forcing it to scroll up int he container)
[11:19:25] <ircplayer> MassDebates: I don't want an hybrid version, I prefere use jquery only it's easy and clean
[11:19:29] <MassDebates> 5) User THEN ses the 'extra space' 'disappear' (this is where display:none occurs)
[11:19:45] <MassDebates> You do this with SOLELY jquery.
[11:20:10] <ircplayer> MassDebates: Yeah thx, it was my first thought to display none after that in order to clean
[11:20:13] <MassDebates> (Jquery driving css, really)
[11:20:23] <MassDebates> Yes, that is the easiest and fastest solution, as noted above twice.
[11:20:37] <MassDebates> .addClass and .removeClass are your friends.
[11:20:56] <MassDebates> You can totally do this with only .addClass and .removeClass
[11:21:02] <ircplayer> yep thx, I know that my code was quite dirty but it's before to go with jquery
[11:21:17] <ircplayer> Oh so with css
[11:21:41] <ircplayer> keep my animations and only apply class and after display none after the delay of the animation ?
[11:22:18] <Mo0O> any through about my https://jsfiddle.net/d1boLfc4/ issue? do you think it's possible to overrite that kind of method?
[11:23:22] <Mo0O> ircplayer: do transition -CSS- not animation -JS-, use JS to trigger CSS class change -so tho trigger transition
[11:23:33] <Mo0O> s/tho/to/
[11:23:45] <ircplayer> ok
[11:23:50] <ircplayer> thx
[11:23:53] <Mo0O> np
[11:24:38] <MassDebates> DONT KEEP YOUR ANIMATION
[11:24:42] <MassDebates> CHANGE TO TRANSITION
[11:24:45] <MassDebates> oh okay he said that
[11:24:51] <Mo0O> ^^
[11:24:54] <MassDebates> I wanted to catch his attention before he left.
[11:25:03] <Mo0O> ;)
[11:25:27] <MassDebates> Okay, you've got something?
[11:25:31] <MassDebates> 2 secs.
[11:25:39] <MassDebates> Goodness, wheres taplar and robmaxrees
[11:25:49] <MassDebates> I'm supposed to be the shitposting troll.
[11:25:54] <MassDebates> I'm not supposed to help people
[11:25:58] <Mo0O> lol
[11:26:38] <MassDebates> Mo0O:  Okay, so you're trying to change some css?
[11:26:59] <Mo0O> no to overrite a jquery function method
[11:27:15] <MassDebates> Oh
[11:27:20] <Mo0O> css class are here just to make it easy to explain
[11:27:39] <Mo0O> "baz" method could do anything
[11:28:07] <Mo0O> and be called anywhere in "bar" function
[11:28:29] <MassDebates> I see what you're saying
[11:28:38] <Mo0O> thx
[11:28:50] <Mo0O> I don't know if it's possible
[11:28:59] <MassDebates> 2 secs
[11:31:05] <taplar> i was in meetings
[11:31:21] <MassDebates> http://jsfiddle.net/2rZN7/154/
[11:31:27] <MassDebates> I think this may be of value for you to see.
[11:31:44] <MassDebates> Let's crack this down, shall we?
[11:31:53] <MassDebates> Now, keep in mind, this is simply a written function
[11:31:59] <MassDebates> Doing core is a bit different but carries the same concepts.
[11:32:03] <taplar> ln 4 is an unnecessary each
[11:32:14] <taplar> css() will do an each over the stack already
[11:32:40] <Mo0O> MassDebates: good try, I've seen this in a SO answer, but it doesn't fit the issue as you can see
[11:32:51] <MassDebates> I grabbed this from SO
[11:32:58] <Mo0O> I see ;)
[11:33:16] <MassDebates> I don't know enough about jquery to understand what you're asking, then.
[11:33:29] <Mo0O> but this overrite the whole function, and the call the original one
[11:33:55] <MassDebates> Did you say that?
[11:34:00] <MassDebates> I thought thats what you wanted.
[11:34:02] <Mo0O> I'm looking to overrite a function -method exactly- in a function
[11:34:08] <MassDebates> oh
[11:34:16] <MassDebates> Yeah, can be done. I can't help you though.
[11:34:19] <taplar> huh?
[11:34:33] <MassDebates> He wants to attribute parts of a function to another function via arg
[11:34:46] <Mo0O> taplar: something like that https://jsfiddle.net/d1boLfc4/
[11:35:06] <MassDebates> I'd help but, just because I know a car runs on gasoline doesn't mean I know why the gas explodes with electricity.
[11:35:15] <Mo0O> but my example just show the issue, it doesn't solve it
[11:35:39] <Mo0O> MassDebates: no problem
[11:35:56] <Mo0O> taplar: do you see the idea?
[11:37:05] <Mo0O> indeed using prototype doesn't works, I've try with $.extend too, with no luck indeed
[11:37:37] <Mo0O> I guess I'm trying to solve an unsolvable problem
[11:37:46] <Mo0O> what do you think about?
[11:37:54] <taplar> yeah, got to do something real quick.  i don't mess with prototypes much, but i'm not sure you can do it like that.
[11:38:18] <taplar> i'm more familiar with prototypes on functions when you do new function() instantiations
[11:39:18] <Mo0O> I see, and this is the main problem, which is we are dealing with a function, not an object
[11:39:38] <taplar> i'd have to ask why you don't just call the method instead of attaching it.
[11:40:26] <cjohnson> Mo0O: what are you trying to do?
[11:40:40] <Mo0O> this is just an example, I plan to overite a method in a jquery function
[11:40:52] <taplar> ok?
[11:41:09] <cjohnson> Mo0O: Ok, just do $.fn.whateverMethod = yourNewFunction
[11:41:13] <cjohnson> that will overwrite that other method
[11:42:01] <Mo0O> cjohnson: yes but the whole one
[11:42:05] <Mo0O> let me show you
[11:42:16] <Mo0O> here: https://github.com/Dogfalo/materialize/blob/1fdf905514966bad6b07a73a3b7a84fab91aaac0/js/chips.js
[11:42:39] <cjohnson> what part of this specifically am I looking at
[11:42:42] <Mo0O> there is the code of $.fn.material_chip
[11:42:50] <Mo0O> https://github.com/Dogfalo/materialize/blob/1fdf905514966bad6b07a73a3b7a84fab91aaac0/js/chips.js#L20 here exactly
[11:43:01] <cjohnson> ok and what about it?
[11:43:01] <MassDebates> Oh
[11:43:02] <MassDebates> Dude
[11:43:07] <MassDebates> I been through this
[11:43:15] <Mo0O> and I want to overrite this one : https://github.com/Dogfalo/materialize/blob/1fdf905514966bad6b07a73a3b7a84fab91aaac0/js/chips.js#L227-L237
[11:43:26] <Mo0O> which is inside the fist one
[11:43:33] <cjohnson> what do you mean overwrite it? you are writing it here
[11:43:39] <cjohnson> why do you need ot overwrite it if you'r the one writing it?
[11:44:12] <Mo0O> cjohnson: I'm not the one writing it
[11:44:26] <Mo0O> well, at least ATM
[11:44:42] <cjohnson> Ok. well the object it's writing to is `this`
[11:44:47] <cjohnson> so get a reference to whatever `this` is
[11:44:53] <cjohnson> and just overwrite the property that way
[11:44:55] <dni-> is think mo0O problem is
[11:44:57] <cjohnson> this sure smells of XY though
[11:45:00] <cjohnson> !xy
[11:45:10] <Mo0O> yeah
[11:45:14] <Mo0O> I guess too
[11:45:34] <Mo0O> but as you can see the function doesn't return this
[11:45:38] <Mo0O> "this"
[11:45:56] <Mo0O> so, I've got no reference to `this`
[11:46:48] <Mo0O> like in my example: https://jsfiddle.net/d1boLfc4/
[11:46:51] <taplar> technically there is no 'this' until that method executes
[11:47:13] <Mo0O> true
[11:47:14] <taplar> 'this' will be whatever you call material_chips on
[11:47:43] <Mo0O> ok, so it's the jquery binded DOM element
[11:47:52] <taplar> the jQuery object
[11:48:20] <Mo0O> yes, sorry for the vocabulary
[11:49:14] <taplar> so after you do var $x = $(blah); $x.material_chips();
[11:49:22] <Mo0O> taplar: cjohnson: you just rox ;-)
[11:49:22] <taplar> see if $x has that method you are wanting to overwrite
[11:49:33] <Mo0O> thanks a lot :)
[11:49:52] <dni-> :)
[11:50:08] <Mo0O> do know why I didn't figure it out sooner ^^
[11:53:39] <taplar> i've seen that mentioned a couple days now i think.  what is an XY?  is it like a q->p?
[11:54:47] <duch_kazatel> that was weird.
[11:55:13] <taplar> hmm?
[11:55:32] <robertmaxrees> got dc'd for some reason
[11:55:57] <taplar> i usually get a hicup at least once a day with this web irc
[11:56:55] <Mo0O> taplar: http://xyproblem.info/
[11:57:26] <robertmaxrees> ^
[11:57:33] <robertmaxrees> "The XY problem: You want to do X, but don't know how. You think you can solve it using Y, but don't know how to do that either. You ask about Y, which is a strange thing to want to do. Just ask about X. See also: http://xyproblem.info/"
[11:57:43] <robertmaxrees> the ##javascript channel's bot spits that out.
[11:57:47] <taplar> ah
[11:59:16] <taplar> lol the basis for the "this doesn't work"  "what are you trying to do?" conversation
[11:59:23] <robertmaxrees> exactly.
[12:00:01] <Mo0O> yeah
[12:00:01] <robertmaxrees> it's also partially why i'm skeptical when people say something "doesn't work"
[12:00:06] <robertmaxrees> without much context.
[12:00:22] <taplar> i just don't like the vague statement, ^_^
[12:00:23] <Mo0O> which doesn't make sense at all
[12:00:50] <robertmaxrees> right - it's vague because they have so much context that they assume we know more than we know.
[12:01:52] <taplar> women
[12:02:16] * taplar isn't sure if he's proud of that or not
[12:02:42] <taplar> anywho, any luck Mo0O?
[12:07:10] <taplar> i get the office space all to myself this evening, :D
[12:08:51] <robertmaxrees> oh?
[12:09:03] <taplar> yeah, team is going out for their yearly outing
[12:09:12] <robertmaxrees> not going with?
[12:09:40] <taplar> nah, i'm all about keeping work and personal separate.  and i spend all day with these peeps in a shared space.  no need to spend more time together
[12:09:56] <robertmaxrees> that's fair.
[12:10:54] <taplar> i used to go back when we were still in cubicle world
[12:13:52] <robertmaxrees> iiiinteresting
[12:13:55] <Mo0O> taplar: you asking me to tell you if I'm a woman or a man?
[12:14:03] <taplar> i'd never
[12:14:07] <Mo0O> thx
[12:14:15] <Mo0O> :)
[12:14:35] <taplar> i refer to everyone as dude
[12:14:37] <ajpiano> we used to have a bot that talkede about xyproblem
[12:14:50] <taplar> except for Uhkis who i thought was a chick for a while
[12:14:51] <Mo0O> taplar: good choice
[12:14:57] <Mo0O> ^^
[12:15:02] <MassDebates> Just wanted to say
[12:15:06] <robertmaxrees> yeah, b-ot .  wonder what happened to it.
[12:15:09] <MassDebates> Women.
[12:15:18] <MassDebates> That is all for now. toodles.
[12:15:29] <ajpiano> k that's weird but....
[12:15:31] <taplar> mofo stole my joke...
[12:15:59] <taplar> being a sexist i can tolerate, but thievery!!!
[12:16:06] <taplar> or plagurism...
[12:16:12] <taplar> which is thievery, whatever...
[12:16:14] <taplar> i need lunch
[12:16:18] <robertmaxrees> heh...
[12:17:27] <robertmaxrees> ajpiano i'm not sure who ran b-ot but i'd love to have it back.
[12:17:32] <robertmaxrees> it was broken for a while, iirc.
[12:17:59] <ajpiano> yeah i think it fell into a whole
[12:21:31] <ajpiano> hole*
[12:22:48] <snover> w-hole
[12:24:29] <taplar_food> i've thought about making a new one, but i've forgotten how i once did that with php
[12:25:59] <taplar_food> i remember being a kid and making some to admin rooms.  nothing more fun at that time than kicking people for being idiots and them not knowing to prompted it
[12:26:10] <taplar_food> to=who
[12:26:54] <taplar_food> sorry, not php.  perl
[12:58:22] <ircplayer> MassDebates: https://jsbin.com/yeqavucori/1/edit?html,css,js,output
[12:58:39] <ircplayer> MassDebates: why there is a space between the first and the second ?
[12:59:02] <ircplayer> MassDebates: sorry bade link https://jsbin.com/yeqavucori/edit?html,css,js,output
[12:59:16] <MassDebates> I don't see a space between the 1st and second.
[12:59:17] <MassDebates> Oh
[12:59:42] <decx> set img to block
[12:59:56] <decx> img is an inline element
[13:00:04] <ircplayer> MassDebates: https://jsbin.com/biromokujo/1/edit?html,css,js,output
[13:00:14] <ircplayer> I hope it is the good one
[13:00:15] <robertmaxrees> also: give those three elements a shared class and select that instead
[13:01:09] <taplar_food> i think that's the first time i've see the $ at the end
[13:01:20] <ircplayer> Sorry just in rxjs
[13:01:20] <robertmaxrees> heh
[13:01:23] <ircplayer> :D
[13:01:25] <ircplayer> I will change
[13:01:33] <decx> the buck stops here
[13:01:43] <taplar_food> lol
[13:01:48] <robertmaxrees> also: var idNb = parseInt(this.id.match(/\d+/)[0]);
[13:02:00] <robertmaxrees> use data attributes or something instead.
[13:02:25] <taplar_food> personally i'd also rename 'onClick' to be more descriptive as to what it actually does
[13:02:30] <robertmaxrees> ^
[13:02:41] <robertmaxrees> you already know it's running on click ;)
[13:02:49] <ircplayer> Guys pls ...
[13:02:50] <MassDebates> ircplayer:  -webkit-margin-before is a property often used in chrome.
[13:02:55] <robertmaxrees> heh.
[13:02:59] <robertmaxrees> we're giving you pointers :)
[13:03:05] <robertmaxrees> things to clean your stuff up.
[13:03:13] <ircplayer> god don't juge this dirty code just give the solution :D
[13:03:22] <ircplayer> It's not for prod
[13:03:26] <taplar_food> $('.images').on('hover', onClick)
[13:03:26] <ircplayer> :)
[13:03:28] <taplar_food> heh
[13:03:40] <robertmaxrees> just sayin' yo.
[13:03:42] <MassDebates> "Don't tell me that it's impossible to drive a car without tires on the wheels, just tell me how to drive it without tires"
[13:03:43] <robertmaxrees> nvd
[13:03:50] <taplar> did you just tell us to 'just give the solution'?
[13:03:52] <MassDebates> A bit of a stretch for my statement there, but really, it's the same problem.
[13:03:59] <taplar> your in the wrong room then man, ;)
[13:04:10] <ircplayer> Ok thx MassDebates
[13:04:19] <robertmaxrees> heh
[13:04:20] <MassDebates> ircplayer:  -webkit-margin-before.
[13:04:22] <decx> the space between 1 and 2 is because of the ul margin in the #content-1
[13:04:38] <decx> the space between the other images is because img is inline and that space is for descenders
[13:04:38] <MassDebates> I don't know much about ^
[13:04:51] <decx> like a g, y and so forth
[13:04:54] <MassDebates> I didn't exactly uh, look at it. just a guess, really.
[13:05:08] <MassDebates> decx sounds like he knows a lot about what's going on in your jsbin.
[13:05:10] <taplar> just like a doctor
[13:05:12] <MassDebates> You should ask him.
[13:05:14] <decx> i'm an expert
[13:05:16] <MassDebates> LOL taplar
[13:05:22] <MassDebates> I love you guys
[13:05:25] <taplar> doesn't even look at it, that's MD
[13:05:42] <MassDebates> ... so you're saying doctors put the MD in MassDebates ?
[13:05:57] <robertmaxrees> #welp
[13:05:57] <MassDebates> Shit, wait
[13:06:02] <MassDebates> Damnit
[13:06:02] <taplar> :)
[13:06:28] <MassDebates> My love is gone.
[13:06:34] <MassDebates> It has been replaced with a jaded hatred.
[13:06:49] <taplar> at least it's valueable
[13:06:49] <MassDebates> because taplar baited & checkmated
[13:06:56] <MassDebates> he says its valuable and he knows his shit
[13:07:02] <MassDebates> but why he says I don't know it
[13:07:05] <taplar> lol
[13:07:07] <MassDebates> 'eyyy sickass rap
[13:08:34] <MassDebates> ircnode0:  #content-1 ul { -webkit-margin-before: 0; } oughtta do the trick for ya
[13:08:37] <MassDebates> er
[13:08:46] <MassDebates> ircplayer:  66666
[13:08:51] <MassDebates> ircnode0:  ^^^^
[13:08:53] <MassDebates> OFMg n
[13:09:02] <robertmaxrees> wat
[13:09:11] <MassDebates> Don't even ask.
[13:09:19] <taplar> shrooms
[13:09:20] <MassDebates> I can't even begin to explain what happened here.
[13:09:28] <MassDebates> Just... so mad
[13:09:39] <robertmaxrees> ok
[13:09:54] <MassDebates> Somketimes its comedic but it really gets annoying
[13:10:08] <taplar> did i go too far?
[13:10:11] <MassDebates> No
[13:10:25] <MassDebates> I just wish I could do that shit they do in avatar, but with my keyboard
[13:10:55] <MassDebates> Y'know, with the whole plug-my-hair-tail-into-stuff shit
[13:12:29] <taplar> i dunno.  i'm sure there are associated diseases that result from that
[13:12:42] <MassDebates> Brain AIDS
[13:15:18] <taplar> ever see the burnt toast media review of avatar?
[13:15:35] <Uhkis> MSBlast would be narcolepsy :(
[13:15:58] <taplar> lol, where did that come from?
[13:16:24] <Uhkis> taplar: you remember msblast?
[13:16:30] <taplar> no
[13:16:57] <Uhkis> it was that virus/worm that made your windows xp shut down randomly on a timer
[13:17:02] <taplar> MS makes me think microsoft, and Blast makes me think Sonic, so i'm thoroughly confused
[13:17:06] <taplar> ah
[13:17:15] <taplar> lol
[13:17:20] <MassDebates> I had the worm
[13:17:27] <Uhkis> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blaster_(computer_worm)
[13:17:35] <Uhkis> MassDebates: who didnt :D
[13:17:46] <MassDebates> Back at the time though
[13:17:49] <MassDebates> I was letting toshiba have it
[13:17:55] <MassDebates> Man, those poor indian tech supports..
[13:18:32] <MassDebates> (poor as in unfortunate to deal with me, not poor like money)
[13:18:39] <taplar> i think it was back on xp, though maybe it was still 3.11 i remember my sister shared a file with me that had a fake virus on it.
[13:18:53] <MassDebates> "fake virus"
[13:19:01] <MassDebates> So it was really an anti-virus in disguise?
[13:19:02] <MassDebates> :P
[13:19:08] <taplar> you'd execute it, and a modal would open saying it was starting to erase your hard drive.  you'd move the mouse towards it to cancel it and it would kick your mouse away
[13:19:30] <MassDebates> scareware
[13:19:36] <taplar> then after it reached 100% your screen went black for like 30 seconds.  then it came back with something like "just kidding!  buy this antivirus software!"
[13:19:48] <taplar> i could have killed her
[13:20:38] <MassDebates> lmao
[13:21:02] <Uhkis> damn, that's evil
[13:21:19] <MassDebates> One time I was really pissed off at my dad
[13:21:48] <MassDebates> So I took a screenshot of his desktop, disabled the taskbar
[13:22:42] <MassDebates> Then I took that picture, added to a webpage and made it go fullscreen (i think I couldn't do it without stopping him from exiting it so I clipped out the borders of the window on all sides or something)
[13:23:03] <MassDebates> and I disabled clicking with some javascript i found at javascript.net or something
[13:23:20] <MassDebates> Right clicking*
[13:23:56] <MassDebates> javascriptkit i think
[13:28:13] <taplar> you know, we really doing have things like that anymore.  firmware, hardware, scareware, freeware.  not many new 'wares' being made anymore.  i'd argue that youtube is unproductiveware
[13:28:56] <taplar> faceboom, twitter, google+ <-- socialware!
[13:29:18] <taplar> maybe it was a 90s thing
[13:29:55] <taplar> get clothing from the gap <-- mallwear!
[13:30:01] <taplar> ok i'm done
[13:33:52] <robertmaxrees> cripes i'm exhausted.
[13:39:15] <Uhkis> by taplar's jokes?
[13:39:33] <taplar> ^_^ i'm potent
[13:39:47] <taplar> which if you say that really fast is the opposite
[13:39:52] <taplar> boom
[13:39:57] <robertmaxrees> #sicktight
[13:40:41] <taplar> right now i'm trying to setup awkwardCough for the gap joke over text
[13:46:34] <taplar> got em!
[13:46:41] <robertmaxrees> #boom
[13:55:14] <taplar> mmm, seriously someone needs to ask questions or else i'll feel the need to make more jokes
[13:57:18] <Uhkis> do you like movies about gladiators?
[13:57:28] <robertmaxrees> ever been in a turkish prison?
[13:57:34] <taplar> yes
[13:58:40] <taplar> though what do you mean by turkish prison?  you mean 'in turkey'?  ooooooh
[13:58:50] <robertmaxrees> heh
[13:58:51] <taplar> apologies to the turks
[13:59:05] <robertmaxrees> ever seen airplane?
[13:59:13] <taplar> not sure
[13:59:24] <robertmaxrees> you'd probably dig it.
[13:59:46] <taplar> only airplane movie i recall was one around the early 90s that had everyone getting sick on it
[13:59:55] <taplar> that there was some blow up autopilot doll thing
[14:00:00] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[14:00:02] <robertmaxrees> that's the one.
[14:00:06] <taplar> that's all i remember of it
[14:00:09] <robertmaxrees> and that was the early 80's
[14:00:14] <taplar> lol
[14:00:54] <robertmaxrees> the beginning is an almost shot for shot remake for zero hour iirc
[14:02:23] <robertmaxrees> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-BjU-e01zQ4 hgahahahahaha
[14:04:04] <taplar> lol
[14:04:10] <MassDebates> I'm back
[14:04:17] <MassDebates> Stupid connection things.
[14:04:33] <MassDebates> Anyways, I was left off at taplar needing questions to answer
[14:05:21] <MassDebates> taplar:  we should have a contest.
[14:05:40] <taplar> i haven't drank enough water yet
[14:05:51] <taplar> drunk?
[14:05:53] <taplar> fk
[14:05:56] <robertmaxrees> drank
[14:06:00] <taplar> yesssssss
[14:06:18] <MassDebates> robertmaxrees could give us a simple UI thing to do.I'll try to do it in pure css and html. you do it in 'pure jquery' beyond obvious practicals, no nilla js
[14:06:36] <MassDebates> Could be fun and a great learning engagement for others!
[14:06:56] <taplar> eh, my hands are completely full staring at my build pipeline and watching the pretty yellow, waiting for it to turn green
[14:07:05] <MassDebates> Oh cmon
[14:07:07] <MassDebates> Don't be lame.
[14:07:11] <taplar> if you don't stare at it it will go red
[14:07:32] <MassDebates> Lameeeeeeee
[14:07:37] <taplar> though my mom used to tell me the opposite
[14:08:00] <MassDebates> Would you just freaking participate?
[14:08:17] <MassDebates> Gosh, you're worse than a highschooler.
[14:08:29] <MassDebates> ... a shyschooler!
[14:10:54] <MassDebates> In all seriousness, I think it'd be a great activity. We all get to stretch our legs on something that will be invigorating enough to be out of the norm support cases, but without anything major to be a headache.
[14:11:11] <robertmaxrees> heh most of us are at work fwiw.
[14:11:19] <MassDebates> I'm at work too
[14:11:42] <robertmaxrees> and you have time to do a coding challenge
[14:11:44] <MassDebates> That's why something along the lines of a 5-minute challenge (less time than the avg support case on here, I wager) would be optimal!
[14:11:58] <MassDebates> Well, I mean, I'm making money right now
[14:12:05] <MassDebates> So yeah It's work
[14:12:07] <robertmaxrees> lol
[14:12:30] <robertmaxrees> this guy
[14:12:30] <MassDebates> OH MY GOD http://www.javascriptkit.com/ IS STILL AROUND
[14:12:35] <taplar> sure
[14:12:46] <MassDebates> Really?
[14:12:49] <taplar> comes up a few times when i google javascript stuff
[14:12:52] <MassDebates> oh boy oh boy ohboyohboyohboy
[14:13:00] <robertmaxrees> he said "sure" to the site.
[14:13:03] <MassDebates> omg
[14:13:04] <taplar> lol
[14:13:07] <robertmaxrees> lol
[14:13:09] <robertmaxrees> calm down, yo.
[14:13:20] <MassDebates> I got legit excited
[14:13:24] <robertmaxrees> i can tell.
[14:13:33] <taplar> you think to highly of me i thunk
[14:13:44] <MassDebates> lol
[14:13:53] <MassDebates> Maybe so, or maybe it's because nobody else will play with me :(
[14:14:02] <robertmaxrees> or both.
[14:14:19] <MassDebates> I just know both of you are far more qualified in jquery/javascript stuff than I am
[14:14:37] <robertmaxrees> we're probably just much better troubleshooters.
[14:14:45] <MassDebates> And I never get a chance to try to do things with pure CSS in _actual projects_
[14:15:02] <MassDebates> Because there's never any practical benefit to the client
[14:15:28] <taplar> i rewrote a part of my site to use mosly just css and plain js, if your interested in viewing
[14:15:54] <MassDebates> Sure
[14:16:08] <MassDebates> But it would mean the world to me if we can have a small activity like that.
[14:16:13] <MassDebates> I'll wait for my birthday.
[14:16:13] <taplar> https://github.com/taplar/taplar-hiddenworld
[14:16:31] <MassDebates> Why
[14:16:33] <MassDebates> my eyes hurt
[14:16:37] <taplar> hmm?
[14:16:57] <robertmaxrees> MassDebates sounds like you should search for coding challenged.
[14:16:58] <MassDebates> Sorry, that was for a PM
[14:17:00] <robertmaxrees> *challenges
[14:17:08] <MassDebates> Those are far too formal, and I actually like you guys
[14:17:13] <robertmaxrees> lol
[14:17:24] <MassDebates> Cmon, don't you want to foster passion for code?!
[14:17:28] <MassDebates> Isn't that why you're HERE!?
[14:17:28] <robertmaxrees> uh
[14:17:36] <robertmaxrees> "hey you should come up with an activity for me to do".
[14:17:44] <MassDebates> No no
[14:17:46] <robertmaxrees> "then look at it and critique it when i'm done".
[14:17:47] <MassDebates> I came up with the activity
[14:17:47] <robertmaxrees> heh
[14:17:53] <MassDebates> You just have to like
[14:17:55] <MassDebates> Say something like
[14:17:55] <robertmaxrees> you came up with a generic idea.
[14:18:04] <robertmaxrees> you want me to do a bunch of other stuff to fulfill on that ;)
[14:18:12] <MassDebates> Er
[14:18:16] <MassDebates> I think you got the wrong idea
[14:18:20] <robertmaxrees> lol
[14:18:22] <MassDebates> For example, Slideshow
[14:18:26] <MassDebates> You can say
[14:18:31] <MassDebates> "Make a slideshow, but....."
[14:18:38] <MassDebates> (And then this part is the fun part for you rob)
[14:18:44] <robertmaxrees> it's not fun for me...
[14:18:45] <robertmaxrees> heh
[14:18:52] <MassDebates> You don't know how to live man
[14:19:00] <MassDebates> People pay big bucks for this sort of experience
[14:19:02] <robertmaxrees> "hey you should give me a coding challenge" == "you should come up with something for me to do and then do a critique of my work when i'm done"
[14:19:11] <MassDebates> No I don't want a critique
[14:19:22] <robertmaxrees> lol
[14:19:24] <robertmaxrees> (shrug)
[14:19:25] <MassDebates> Maybe like a quick glance at mine and then one at taplar 's and then say
[14:19:29] <MassDebates> "Mass Wins"
[14:19:37] <MassDebates> You don't even have to look at it even. Just say I win
[14:19:45] <taplar> i don't really enjoy other people looking at mine
[14:19:54] <robertmaxrees> heh
[14:20:05] <robertmaxrees> i appreciate the gung-ho attitude.
[14:20:21] <robertmaxrees> i'd check out the tons of coding tutorials out in the wild tbh.
[14:20:47] <MassDebates> Ugh you're missing the point!
[14:20:53] <MassDebates> I want to pitt CSS against Jquery
[14:20:58] <MassDebates> in a battledome of code and UI
[14:21:00] <robertmaxrees> why?
[14:21:24] <MassDebates> This is like asking why mount a laser gun on a T-Rex head.
[14:21:32] <robertmaxrees> heh
[14:21:35] <robertmaxrees> sorry we're boring meng
[14:21:37] <MassDebates> You should be asking "Why not"
[14:22:18] <MassDebates> What if I pay you guys an hourly wage for 1hr
[14:22:26] <MassDebates> I'll give you each $50
[14:22:27] <robertmaxrees> lol
[14:22:31] <MassDebates> For 10 mins of your time
[14:22:34] <robertmaxrees> duder.
[14:22:36] <robertmaxrees> heh
[14:22:55] <MassDebates> I don't think you understand how into this idea I am
[14:23:19] <MassDebates> Think about what you can do with that. You can feed a billion ants with $50 (I think)
[14:23:41] <robertmaxrees> "i really like this idea, therefore you should do it"
[14:23:49] <taplar> if you don't like the idea of tutorials, and you want to challenge yourself, you could always troll stackoverflow.  trying to solve other peoples real world problems can be fun.
[14:24:07] <robertmaxrees> ^
[14:24:12] <MassDebates> I used to do that but it gets stale unless if I see something interesting.
[14:24:14] <robertmaxrees> tons of places to scratch that itch.
[14:24:18] <taplar> and they benefit too
[14:24:21] <robertmaxrees> welcome to webdev.
[14:24:23] <MassDebates> Last time was a paradox timer for a transition
[14:24:29] <robertmaxrees> it's boring until it isn't.
[14:24:37] <MassDebates> :(
[14:24:45] <taplar> s'why i have my website
[14:24:51] <taplar> which i've rewritten a ton of times
[14:24:53] <MassDebates> Oh right let me look at that
[14:24:54] <taplar> it's fun, :)
[14:25:00] <robertmaxrees> and why i give trainings at work sometimes.
[14:25:30] <MassDebates> Whut DDO planner?!
[14:25:34] <MassDebates> Nice
[14:25:48] <taplar> doesn't work, early beginning stages
[14:25:58] <taplar> and i'm lazy with that part, heh
[14:26:08] <MassDebates> No worries. Awesome stuff
[14:26:19] <MassDebates> But you guys really don't want to do that?
[14:26:27] <MassDebates> Even if I wait for my birthday? In April
[14:26:42] <MassDebates> I promise I'll shitpost 20% less if you do
[14:26:45] <robertmaxrees> lol
[14:26:47] <robertmaxrees> dude.
[14:26:48] <robertmaxrees> let it go.
[14:27:04] <MassDebates> okay. If you change your mind, don't hesitate to let me know.
[14:27:18] <robertmaxrees> you've made your interest ABUNDANTLY clear.
[14:27:40] <taplar> i'm still slightly unclear why you want to pit css against jquery
[14:27:50] <robertmaxrees> because why not?
[14:27:53] <taplar> cause, not really the same things
[14:28:01] <robertmaxrees> ^^^^
[14:28:55] <MassDebates> Because they both have strengths, weaknesses, and can usually accomplish what the other one can do easily with some workarounds.
[14:29:06] <taplar> sure
[14:29:19] <MassDebates> It stimulates the creativity of the mind, encourages more abstract thinking to problem solving in the future (hint hint: helps you figure otu people's problems on here)
[14:29:27] <taplar> but when you take that approach what you are really talking about is differences in development practices
[14:29:35] <taplar> some people favor css over js
[14:29:37] <taplar> some dont
[14:29:45] <MassDebates> Yeah I prefer CSS and I bet you prefer JS
[14:29:49] <taplar> nope
[14:29:56] <robertmaxrees> there's no preferring one over the other.
[14:30:03] <MassDebates> I know, there's a right tool for the job
[14:30:04] <robertmaxrees> there's "the right tool for each job"
[14:30:06] <robertmaxrees> exactly.
[14:30:12] <MassDebates> But I've banged in a few nails with a wrench before.
[14:30:20] <robertmaxrees> sure - we all have.
[14:30:32] <MassDebates> Did I say $50?
[14:30:39] <MassDebates> I shouldve said $75
[14:30:48] <MassDebates> For 15 minute competition. But I'll drop it
[14:30:54] <taplar> i mean i said i've rewritten my website a ton.  the last rewrite was actually removing alot of logic that was changes to use css logic instead
[14:30:56] <robertmaxrees> please.
[14:31:15] <MassDebates> Oh, serious question about #jquery for something I'm taking care of for someone
[14:31:21] <taplar> and actually i might go back and see if I can use ~ any
[14:31:25] <robertmaxrees> s'up?
[14:32:34] <MassDebates> https://www.pastery.net/kgskah/ is this bad?
[14:32:56] <MassDebates> I'm working from someone else's example but I wanted to make sure it's okay.
[14:32:57] <taplar> which part?
[14:33:08] <taplar> data() instead of attr() was the first thing i saw
[14:33:11] <MassDebates> Well, using the data-attr to identify the correct 'tab'
[14:33:23] <robertmaxrees> yeah, use .data()
[14:33:30] <robertmaxrees> also, mixing single and double quote.
[14:33:58] <taplar> and depending on your markup that whole bit could probably be done with css
[14:34:17] <robertmaxrees> i assume .tab_content is in a completely different container?
[14:34:23] <MassDebates> I did it in CSS for a demo and then I started to grab someone's example
[14:34:26] <robertmaxrees> also - don't prepend selectors with elements.
[14:34:48] <MassDebates> It wouldn't be proper to use the checkbox hack in production code, simply because of support and mobiles.
[14:35:06] <robertmaxrees> also also: $('.tabs li') - store this in a var somewhere before the handler.
[14:35:10] <taplar> what do you mean?
[14:35:12] <robertmaxrees> and save a copy of $(this) somewhere.
[14:35:42] <taplar> i've found the radio/checkbox approach works fine for mobile
[14:36:18] <taplar> it seems to even handle for the issue of panning
[14:36:27] <MassDebates> Im back, sorry
[14:36:30] <MassDebates> uh
[14:36:32] <MassDebates> Oh right
[14:36:56] <MassDebates> No, I've found that the interaction is haphazard from device to device
[14:37:12] <taplar> what device have you found it to be faulty on?
[14:37:17] <MassDebates> Samsung galaxy tablet
[14:37:21] <MassDebates> Sony Z3v
[14:37:29] <taplar> wonder if i can find an emulator for that
[14:37:33] <MassDebates> You can.
[14:37:45] <taplar> cause my website is moving towards that approach
[14:37:51] <robertmaxrees> i'm glad i don't have to worry about edge cases like that.
[14:38:37] <taplar> i wonder if samsung galaxy tablet differs much from the galaxy grand, which it works fine on
[14:38:46] <MassDebates> Hm, I wouldn't say it does.
[14:38:54] <MassDebates> 2 secs
[14:39:40] <MassDebates> Okay, so Here's what my concerns for support are.
[14:40:45] <MassDebates> :checked is generally detectable
[14:41:03] <MassDebates> I find that the native browser for the galaxy device can't handle the selector chain that follows it though
[14:41:24] <MassDebates> I also had a serious issue with transforms (which imo should be further ahead than :checked but I don't decide what their priorities are)
[14:41:26] <taplar> do you have one of those emulators or devices?
[14:41:45] <MassDebates> I have 4 devices of the same model of galaxy tablet
[14:41:58] <taplar> if you have time can you hit hiddenworld.taplar.com and see if it breaks?
[14:42:04] <MassDebates> Here, I can change part of the website to show you the problem. Nobody's looking at this page
[14:42:06] <MassDebates> oh uh
[14:42:09] <MassDebates> 2 secs
[14:42:12] <MassDebates> I'll go get them
[14:43:50] <MassDebates> back
[14:43:54] <MassDebates> okay, going there.
[14:43:58] <taplar> cool
[14:44:07] <MassDebates> using native browser.
[14:44:09] <MassDebates> (and)
[14:45:58] <MassDebates> okay
[14:45:59] <MassDebates> There
[14:47:11] <MassDebates> Visited
[14:47:20] <MassDebates> Looks pretty much the same as it would on a desktop
[14:47:44] <taplar> yeah, it just reduces the horizontal real estate
[14:47:57] <taplar> but the whole menu is driven off of the radio/checkbox label approach
[14:48:02] <MassDebates> Yeah
[14:48:07] <MassDebates> PRobably a label wrapped around the icon, no?
[14:48:25] <MassDebates> 2 secs
[14:48:26] <taplar> radio/checkbox before the content usually
[14:48:35] <taplar> label can be anywhere with the for=""
[14:48:50] <taplar> but the label for the menus is also repurposed for the overlay too
[14:49:04] <MassDebates> yeah
[14:49:34] <MassDebates> Here you'll want this information
[14:49:41] <MassDebates> MODEL: SM-P605V
[14:50:34] <taplar> k, and you're saying it breaks on that model?  with the native browser?
[14:51:11] <MassDebates> No it's working on this one
[14:51:23] <MassDebates> I'm diving into your selectors right now.
[14:52:01] <taplar> https://github.com/taplar/taplar-hiddenworld/blob/master/public/styles/core.less
[14:52:21] <MassDebates> I saw with source tab.
[14:52:23] <MassDebates> Hm
[14:52:31] <MassDebates> This isn't nearly as problematic as I remember.
[14:52:48] <taplar> i'm mainly using it for just show/hide so maybe you were also doing other stuff
[14:53:38] <MassDebates> I was animating the show/hide to show meaning to the bond between the tab ui and the content it brings
[14:53:52] <MassDebates> But I'm trying it now on codepen and it works
[14:54:17] <MassDebates> have these companies really started getting their shit together? Can I start using this?
[14:54:39] <MassDebates> I need to do some testing across a wide range of browsers if I can't find any concrete basis information
[14:54:44] <MassDebates> I don't mind doing that.
[14:54:47] <taplar> i mean, like i said, it seemed to work fine my pc, my phone, my friends blackberry and a blackberry emulator
[14:55:11] <taplar> and i didn't have to deal with panning so i was like, hell yeah
[14:55:51] <MassDebates> Transforms still don't work.
[14:55:56] <MassDebates> A separate origin has to be faked.
[14:56:03] <taplar> ah
[14:56:05] <MassDebates> That's okay though, I'll go with legit abs pos
[14:58:26] <MassDebates> Hm
[14:58:29] <MassDebates> it's native browser
[14:58:41] <MassDebates> Have you tested browsers besides chrome for your website, taplar ?
[14:59:09] <taplar> mainly chrome on the phone, and whatever comes with blackberry.  on my pc i think i ran it through ff.  definately not IE
[14:59:14] <taplar> i'm kinda flipping off IE, :D
[14:59:45] <taplar> though most of the js methods i used should be IE8+ available
[14:59:55] <taplar> iirc, that was my cut off point
[15:01:07] <taplar> yeah FF is fine, whatever this version is
[15:01:12] <MassDebates> yeah you're uh
[15:01:36] <MassDebates> Yeah your case is different than mine.
[15:01:47] <MassDebates> Okay, i learned from that, though!
[15:01:55] <MassDebates> People are really embracing checkboxes. That's awesome.
[15:02:03] <taplar> well, -i- am
[15:02:05] <taplar> lol
[15:02:17] <taplar> i dunno how well this approach fits in a large multi page project
[15:02:33] <MassDebates> Yeah our cases are different
[15:02:38] <MassDebates> but very pleasing to see
[15:03:15] <taplar> it was also a nice side effect that since i'm using checkboxes and radios, i didn't have to worry about binding on click or touch or whatever
[15:03:17] <taplar> just change, :)
[15:03:47] <MassDebates> brb, I'm gonna go give dan his tablet back now
[15:03:56] <taplar> k, tyvm for that btw
[15:05:49] <MassDebates> I tested nats for you
[15:05:56] <MassDebates> Your checkbox hack is certainly working!
[15:06:07] <MassDebates> On ALL devices which is actually surprising to me
[15:06:16] * taplar cheers
[15:06:19] <MassDebates> I think I need to 'update' myself on how browsers deal with stuff
[15:06:30] <MassDebates> (all tested devices, which isn't a ton, but I cover a decent range)
[15:07:00] <MassDebates> I'm not going to change the script for my tabs right now, though. I need to do some more thorough digging firstr.
[15:07:08] <taplar> sure
[15:07:54] <MassDebates> and after checking this stuff
[15:08:08] <MassDebates> it seems that caniuse doesn't reflect samsung's native andr browser on 2d transforms
[15:08:13] <MassDebates> (and its issues)
[15:08:18] <MassDebates> okay, NOW giving it back to danny brb
[15:08:24] <taplar> heh
[15:39:05] <MassDebates> i'm back
[15:39:21] <taplar> wb
[15:40:14] <MassDebates> thanks.
[15:40:23] <MassDebates> so, change .attr to .data?
[15:40:41] <taplar> yeah, typically you want to use data instead of attr for data attributes
[15:41:02] <MassDebates> okay, i'll check it out on the MDN to make sure I change it over correctly.
[15:41:07] <taplar> only case where you might want to use attr would be if you don't want it to do the type conversion
[15:41:28] <taplar> attr('data-me') -> data('me')
[15:41:31] <apricum> join #jquery
[15:41:38] <taplar> u here mate!
[15:41:41] <MassDebates> welcome to jquery apricum
[15:41:46] <apricum> oops
[15:41:48] <MassDebates> Would you like some tea and cookies?
[15:42:05] <apricum> ty
[15:45:12] <MassDebates> taplar:  why?
[15:45:17] <MassDebates> Why make this change?
[15:45:36] <taplar> because data() will cache the values which can provide performance gains
[15:45:46] <taplar> also if you set a value with data(), attr() will not reflect it
[15:45:55] <taplar> so there can be issues there if you intermix
[15:46:46] <MassDebates> so I'd change my attribute's name from data-tab="X" to tab="X"
[15:47:08] <taplar> your markup doesn't change.  just the key in the method, you don't include the data- part
[15:47:35] <taplar> data() knows you are targeting a data element so it will look for the data-prefix
[15:47:56] <taplar> so if you did data('data-tab') it would actually look for data-data-tab
[15:48:06] <MassDebates> right
[15:48:19] <MassDebates> hm, then why doesn't it work? I must have a typo somewhere
[15:48:41] <taplar> watcha got?
[15:48:53] <MassDebates> oh no it does work
[15:49:01] <MassDebates> It'd probably help if I click the tab .
[15:49:31] <MassDebates> I have one tab for the old version with .attr() and 1 tab for .data and I went to the wrong tab
[15:53:42] <MassDebates> http://codepen.io/MassDebates/pen/fbb9fd650918c1e843910b8d78ce2774?editors=1010 taplar
[15:54:08] <MassDebates> Now I get to style :)
[15:54:51] <MassDebates> Gonna make this cross-browser/cross-device
[15:55:00] <taplar> are you ever adding new $('ul.tabs li') ?
[15:55:21] <MassDebates> No I'm changing that completely. That's archaic from the old example.
[15:55:33] <MassDebates> But there will be dynamic content being added during the user session if that's hwat you're asking
[15:55:51] <taplar> i'm more referring to the amount of li in the ul.tabs, not so much their content
[15:56:15] <MassDebates> The li will be changing to divs, spans, and a elements
[15:56:23] <taplar> because if the number of li doesn't change, you could cache that and reuse it inside where you are removing the class
[15:56:47] <MassDebates> Oh I see what you're saying
[15:57:18] <MassDebates> There will be a relatively small amount of content here, and the transitions will be very HW friendly
[16:00:01] <MassDebates> Is there any gain I'm not seeing besides performance?
[16:00:16] <taplar> nah
[16:00:16] <MassDebates> I think any perf gains would be negligible since there's such a small amount of stuff
[16:00:26] <taplar> sure, just my ocd
[16:00:44] <taplar> but many small negligible perf gains can add up
[16:00:57] <MassDebates> If there's enough opportunity for such things!
[16:08:55] <taplar> yeah, broken build!
[16:10:22] <MassDebates> No I mean opportunity for me to actually do it
[16:10:39] <MassDebates> This is limited by my patience and how much they pay me. Time, I've got.
[16:10:52] <taplar> no, i have a broken build, lol
[16:14:49] <MassDebates> oh
[16:14:50] <MassDebates> lol
[16:20:24] <taplar> mofo sessions
[17:04:12] <cydnebkarill> hello
[17:04:16] <cydnebkarill> anybody here=?
[17:04:27] <taplar> yup
[17:04:50] <cydnebkarill> someone willing to give me the missing key to the ajax get function? :S
[17:05:11] <taplar> watcha got?
[17:07:01] <cydnebkarill> https://thepasteb.in/p/y8h6q0RvEVMuO
[17:07:32] <cydnebkarill> if i fire that there is a referenceError
[17:08:16] <taplar> what is 'data' and what is 'success'?
[17:08:27] <cydnebkarill> empty
[17:08:35] <cydnebkarill> i read in the documentation that they are optional?
[17:08:48] <taplar> optional would be not including them at all
[17:08:58] <cydnebkarill> i just figured out if i inpute the plain url into the browser it gives me the data back in html format
[17:09:11] <cydnebkarill> so i could leave them out
[17:09:27] <taplar> if you don't have anything in the data object and success is a dummy function that does nothing, don't include them
[17:10:24] <cydnebkarill> nice thank you =)
[17:11:16] <cydnebkarill> i'm always wondering why our teachers tend to forget such little infromations
[17:11:49] <taplar> it's probably the assumption that if you are making an ajax call then you are providing parameters, and probably want to do something with the response
[17:12:05] <taplar> but, *shrug*, the api would tell you the same thing too, ;)
[17:16:08] <taplar> by the nature of ajax being asynchronous, if you want to use the response you will have to either include a success callback or attach method to the ajax deferred with a then() or something else
[17:17:12] <taplar> if you're completely new to ajax with jQuery then the following reading can be helpful: http://learn.jquery.com/ajax/key-concepts/
[17:17:34] <cydnebkarill> yes i am completly new to ajax so thank you for the link ;)
[17:17:41] <cydnebkarill> i will right dig into it
[17:18:01] <taplar> awesome.  that site has a lot of information about jQuery in general if you want to keep it as a reference
[17:18:15] <taplar> as well as api.jquery.com having the actual api documentation for the methods
[17:18:21] <cydnebkarill> i already had a read at this page but i think im not familiar with the way the site trys to teach me yet
[17:18:56] <taplar> there is also try.jquery.com which is more tutorial based
[17:19:08] <cydnebkarill> you know i found the code there too and tried it in several ways, read trough SO and so on but i didn't get the result i was trying to get
[17:20:07] <taplar> just for the basics there are a couple ways for a successful ajax call
[17:20:28] <cydnebkarill> that's maybe something that confused me that much
[17:20:45] <cydnebkarill> you meantioned asynchronism bevore
[17:21:14] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/21qenyv7/
[17:21:33] <taplar> yeah, ajax by it's nature is asynchronous, which means it doesn't block code execution
[17:21:53] <taplar> the logic past the ajax logic will continue to execute while the ajax is processing, waiting on a response
[17:22:14] <taplar> which imposes a different mindset that you have to take on because traditional returns do not work with that paradigm
[17:23:06] <cydnebkarill> oh men
[17:23:10] <taplar> which in that fiddle i linked is why there is the success and then constructs
[17:23:23] <taplar> you're telling the ajax, i dunno when you will finish, but when you do, do this
[17:23:27] <cydnebkarill> is that like a catch
[17:23:36] <cydnebkarill> i catch if the db is ready to send me the object?
[17:23:42] <taplar> no, catching is still synchronous
[17:23:54] <taplar> if i understand what you are referring to
[17:23:58] <cydnebkarill> hehe
[17:24:14] <cydnebkarill> i mean with that code im sending a request and then the site goes on with wathever
[17:24:25] <taplar> yes
[17:24:32] <cydnebkarill> as son as the side receives the success message it will run some code?
[17:24:36] <taplar> and then when the request completes, it needs to know where to proceed to
[17:25:36] <cydnebkarill> i think we should replace our teacher with you ;)
[17:25:57] <cydnebkarill> wait there is another thing
[17:26:12] <cydnebkarill> you said if it have the api has no success function right?
[17:26:22] <cydnebkarill> how can i check weather it have or not
[17:26:52] <taplar> the two examples i have in that fiddle are two ways to provide the logic it should do on a successful request
[17:26:57] <cydnebkarill> in my opinion it should have one because we're just learning the very basics it's not even a major module
[17:27:02] <taplar> neither of those cover if there was an error in the request
[17:27:30] <cydnebkarill> oh that's not code for one request but two?
[17:27:41] <taplar> two examples of doing essentially the same thing
[17:29:11] <ElJefe> hi guys, I have a question
[17:29:25] <taplar> sup?
[17:29:46] <ElJefe> I am using bootstrap 3, and everytime and event is fired, it adds inline style='display:none'
[17:30:24] <ElJefe> example: tabs
[17:31:00] <taplar> sounds like some binding is catching the event and performing a hide()
[17:31:12] <taplar> or toggle()
[17:32:55] <ElJefe> could be a conflict wit mootools ?
[17:33:39] <taplar> not sure.  i'm not very familiar with the use of bootstrap, or any custom logic you may have on your site
[17:34:38] <taplar> cydnebkarill: yes the success method does not have to be an inline method.  you can give it a function name that is defined else where
[17:35:17] <ElJefe> no, all was working fine under bootstrap 2, I switched to bootstrap 3, and I get this with tooltips, tabs, dropdowns etc
[17:36:24] <Zzaichik> Hey - what's the best event to use for when a use clicks, or puts focus on a text input field? 'focus' right?
[17:36:31] <Zzaichik> a user*
[17:36:42] <taplar> focus works, sure
[17:36:50] <Zzaichik> which would be best
[17:36:58] <taplar> focus would work for if the user tabed to it as well
[17:37:30] <Zzaichik> oh nice! So whether they tab or click to the input, it will trigger that event?
[17:37:34] <taplar> yep
[17:37:48] <Zzaichik> okay - so I'm going to stick with .focus() then. Athankyouse
[17:38:04] <taplar> i'd suggest on('focus') instead
[17:38:16] <taplar> focus() as a binder is just a wrapper for on()
[17:38:20] <Zzaichik> nice - yeah that's how I was writing it, actually.
[17:38:33] <Zzaichik> on('focus', function() {....
[17:40:09] <cydnebkarill> @taplar so if im doing the success: function(data)... what is the difference to without success? because in the browser js console it shows me the same :S
[17:40:32] <taplar> without the success, the request gets the response, but then does nothing with it
[17:41:39] <taplar> so if the response is supossed to return something, and you want to do something with the response, then you need either the success callback or the then() use to provide a success callback
[17:41:41] <ElJefe> Zzaichik for tooltip is a hover, when the mouse is out, the link that has a tooltip gets hidden
[17:42:12] <cydnebkarill> https://thepasteb.in/p/lOhO0AZBOwWtB
[17:42:27] <cydnebkarill> so shouldn't this clear the whole text of the console? :S
[17:42:44] <ElJefe> taplar it's definitely mootools ... fixed
[17:42:54] <taplar> cydnebkarill: console.clear() iirc
[17:43:01] <Zzaichik> roger that, ElJefe I'm trying to capture input[type="text"] on focus to give its parents sibling a special treatment. :D
[17:43:33] <cydnebkarill> nice =)
[17:43:37] <taplar> brb
[17:44:05] <Zzaichik> I have some options to choose from , then the last option is an input field so the user can enter whatever they want.
[17:44:14] <Zzaichik> so radio buttons
[17:44:51] <Zzaichik> I want to caput the :checked attr if that custom val input on focus. Sounded like a good idea...
[17:44:56] <Zzaichik> capture*
[18:12:29] <physikoi> Hello #jquery, with respect to events, is it possible to delegate to grandchildren? That is -- `element.on(events,grandchildren, handler)`
[18:12:39] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[18:12:48] <robertmaxrees> you mean bubble "down"?
[18:12:54] <robertmaxrees> or just delegate in generate?
[18:13:02] <robertmaxrees> like, respond to events that happen on a descendent?>
[18:13:50] <physikoi> robertmaxrees: that last thing you said!
[18:14:03] <robertmaxrees> that's exactly the syntax then :)
[18:14:13] <robertmaxrees> $('parent').on('event', '
[18:14:28] <robertmaxrees> * $('parent').on('event', 'descendentSelector', function);
[18:15:15] <physikoi> robertmaxrees: ok, so if my 'descendendSelector' is , say, 'a', then listeners are applied to all 'a's -- no matter the depth?
[18:15:25] <robertmaxrees> sort of.
[18:15:48] <robertmaxrees> they're not applied directly to the <a> tags - the handler relies on the fact that the event propogates up through the DOM tree.
[18:16:07] <robertmaxrees> but yes, all descendent <a>s will trigger so long as nothing is stopping that propagation
[18:17:27] <physikoi> robertmaxrees: thank you for the clarification.
[18:17:37] <robertmaxrees> yep :) the api docs explain all of this, as well.
[18:18:25] <physikoi> robertmaxrees: the api docs are quite good!
[18:18:36] <physikoi> sometimes it helps to have it rephrased though
[18:18:39] <robertmaxrees> sure.
[18:18:44] <robertmaxrees> the learning center is great for that, too :)
[18:19:12] <physikoi> What's that? here? :D
[18:20:30] <robertmaxrees> learn.jquery.com
[18:20:34] <robertmaxrees> separate site :)
[18:20:38] <robertmaxrees> there's also try.jquery.com
[18:20:41] <robertmaxrees> lots of fantastic resources!
[18:21:03] <physikoi> robertmaxrees: brb, bookmarking
[18:21:07] <robertmaxrees> 'k
[18:30:09] <phelix> https://postimg.org/image/ragm7hqgp/ Anyone have any idea how to get the element from inside markers?? I have tried console.log(scope.markers) but its empty. But others like scope.map works. I see that its an array but tried scope['markers'] and that didn't seem to work either
[18:30:35] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[18:30:53] <robertmaxrees> JSON.stringify(scope) -> paste that into a fiddle.
[18:31:42] <phelix> TypeError: Converting circular structure to JSON
[18:31:48] <robertmaxrees> heh
[18:31:51] <robertmaxrees> that's tough.
[18:31:58] <robertmaxrees> how are you logging out that object?
[18:32:06] <robertmaxrees> just console.log(scope)?
[18:32:11] <phelix> console.log(scope)
[18:32:33] <phelix> I am using angularjs. However, this seemed like it would have been a basic jquery question
[18:32:40] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[18:32:42] <robertmaxrees> that's not jquery heh
[18:32:51] <robertmaxrees> also: "I see that its an array but tried scope['markers']" - that has nothing to do with arrays.
[18:33:04] <robertmaxrees> that just becomes scope.markers under the hood.
[18:33:14] <phelix> WEll the property markers is an array. Normally can grab array in that matter.
[18:33:19] <phelix> yes thats what I thought
[18:33:22] <robertmaxrees> right.
[18:33:37] <robertmaxrees> what happens when you do console.log(scope.markers)?
[18:33:40] <phelix> but neither returning anything.. However if i return scope.map it displays the elements from there just fine
[18:34:12] <phelix> I just get []
[18:34:22] <robertmaxrees> but if you map you're getting values?
[18:34:27] <phelix> yup
[18:34:56] <phelix> Thought it might have something to do how map is object and markers is array
[18:35:02] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[18:35:04] <robertmaxrees> arrays ARE objects.
[18:35:09] <robertmaxrees> just like functions.
[18:35:29] <phelix> hmm
[18:35:53] <robertmaxrees> i'd wonder if that .map() is angular's or something.
[18:36:04] <phelix> no its an object that I created
[18:36:08] <phelix> same with markers
[18:36:11] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[18:36:13] <robertmaxrees> uh...
[18:36:25] <robertmaxrees> you've lost me.
[18:36:26] <phelix> in my controller I created those objects inside the scope
[18:36:36] <phelix> trying to access this scope data from my directive.
[18:36:38] <robertmaxrees> "inside the scope" - you mean on the scope object?
[18:36:42] <phelix> yes
[18:36:45] <robertmaxrees> that'
[18:37:03] <robertmaxrees> "scope" is a funny word here - is that a name you chose or angular chose?
[18:37:20] <phelix> its an angular thing
[18:37:35] <robertmaxrees> no clue then - you should ask in the angular channel.
[18:37:40] <robertmaxrees> they likely define their own methods and tyhings.
[18:37:42] <phelix> ok thanks
[19:03:57] <supersupper> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/d1831df597b4285f4a31ed6ba66bd888
[19:04:06] <supersupper> is there anything wrong with how i'm doing thje .on ?
[19:04:26] <supersupper> that code works until the inputField is replaced after an ajax call
[19:05:04] <robertmaxrees> are #startingMRR, #endingMRR replaced at any point?
[19:06:00] <supersupper> robertmaxrees, I don't...think... I'm not 100% sure
[19:06:26] <robertmaxrees> if those or a parent of them gets replaced, that would do it.
[19:06:43] <supersupper> robertmaxrees, ah alright
[19:06:48] <supersupper> other than that it looks right?
[19:08:20] <robertmaxrees> (shrug) maybe?
[19:08:25] <robertmaxrees> should be fine.
[19:08:27] <robertmaxrees> nothing sticks out.
[22:42:14] <Darmani> Hi everyone! I can't seem to get my modal to work. Could someone take a look at my fiddle and tell me what I'm doing wrong?
