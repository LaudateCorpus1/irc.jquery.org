[00:11:03] <doug65536> motaka2: I do .get().tagName
[00:11:38] <doug65536> motaka2: .is() can probably do that too
[00:12:09] <doug65536> motaka2: .is('select')
[00:15:30] <doug65536> motaka2: http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/kdqkV/3/
[00:15:52] <doug65536> http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/kdqkV/4/
[00:20:45] <doug65536> motaka2: .is('select') works for me. are you sure there isn't a nearby bug that makes it look like it doesn't work?
[00:25:37] <doug65536> APane: that question will be closed as a duplicate
[00:25:50] <doug65536> APane: it is effectively a "how do I create a cookie" question
[00:27:22] <doug65536> APane: you have a server side database for logins right?
[00:27:47] <doug65536> APane: what language are you using on the server side?
[00:28:11] <grafi> [08:04:53] <APane> I've built the app in rails @ doug65536
[00:28:39] <doug65536> grafi: ty. just came back from afk :)
[00:28:48] <grafi> :)
[00:29:22] <grafi> the cookie part i already pointed out, apparently it doesnt work though
[00:29:48] <doug65536> doesn't work?
[00:29:57] <grafi> dont ask me
[00:29:58] <grafi> ^^
[00:30:02] <doug65536> lol
[00:30:10] <doug65536> Oh I see
[00:30:14] <grafi> [08:03:55] <APane> grafi, yup i've tried jquery cookie
[00:30:19] <grafi> [08:04:09] <APane> didn't work for me, then again i probably set it up wrong :/
[00:30:23] <grafi> [08:04:26] <APane> how do you set the cookie? this is what i did.
[00:30:23] <grafi> [08:04:29] <APane> $.cookie('guides', 'true')
[00:30:32] <grafi> seems like that should work?
[00:30:52] <doug65536> I'm going to refresh his page with debugger up :)
[00:30:59] <grafi> anyways, personally I would much prefer showing the guide on first login
[00:31:04] <doug65536> Uncaught TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'foundation'
[00:31:12] <grafi> as cookie get deleted, not everyone accepts them
[00:31:24] <doug65536> browser probably abandoms his script and most of it doesn't even execute
[00:31:40] <grafi> so saving the guide_shown status in the db will be much less annoying
[00:32:21] <chovy> i am sorting a jquery list of elements, and when I add that list back into the dom, i seem to loose my event handlers.
[00:32:52] <grafi> chovy use event delegation
[00:32:55] <doug65536> chovy: how are you sorting them?
[00:33:20] <chovy> grafi: $rows = $tbody.find('tr')
[00:33:23] <chovy> $rows.sort(fn);
[00:33:31] <chovy> $tbody.html($rows);
[00:33:40] <doug65536> chovy: that's why
[00:33:45] <chovy> why?
[00:33:50] <chovy> what am i doing wrong?
[00:33:59] <doug65536> you are putting them back in as strings right?
[00:34:18] <chovy> $rows is a list of jquery objects.
[00:34:29] <chovy> do those get converted to html strings?
[00:34:36] <chovy> when i use .html()
[00:34:38] <chovy> ?
[00:34:42] <doug65536> you should use .remove() on those nodes. sort that. then .append() them back in
[00:35:04] <doug65536> or .insertAfter or whatever
[00:35:18] <doug65536> I think that preserves handlers - I could be wrong though
[00:35:26] <doug65536> I have a fiddle that sorts that way....
[00:35:34] <chovy> so $tbody.find('tr').remove().append($rows); ?
[00:35:36] <doug65536> let me test my hypothesis
[00:35:47] <doug65536> try that ya
[00:35:50] <chovy> kk
[00:35:53] <doug65536> wait
[00:36:00] <doug65536> yes
[00:38:00] <chovy> doug65536: didn't seem to work.
[00:38:34] <chovy> i think when i remove them i loose the events
[00:38:35] <doug65536> yes you're right
[00:39:35] <doug65536> use .detach() instead of .remove()
[00:39:42] <doug65536> actually
[00:39:59] <doug65536> use .detach instead of .find()
[00:40:11] <doug65536> chovy: ^
[00:40:50] <doug65536> chovy: that definitely works: http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/9jRbR/39/
[00:42:46] <doug65536> chovy: http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/9jRbR/41/
[00:47:06] <doug65536> grafi: I guess I only get one chance :)
[00:47:24] <grafi> just like everyone else ^^
[00:49:25] <chovy> i don't think you need assing divs = divs.sort
[00:49:29] <chovy> it does it inplace
[00:50:40] <doug65536> chovy: yes but it returns it too. oh well
[00:51:25] <chovy> ok
[00:51:38] <doug65536> so in all that animating and modification of dom and deferral of multiple animations and complex sort you found that issue :D
[00:52:08] <doug65536> I think I did alright
[00:52:45] <grafi> me too
[00:52:46] <grafi> :D
[00:53:05] * grafi gives out golden noodles for everyone
[00:53:29] <grafi> Google goes dark for 2 minutes, kills 40% of world's net traffic. (theregister.co.uk)
[00:53:41] <grafi> ha! and i was there, trying to watch youtube videos oô
[00:54:22] <doug65536> grafi: they need more links on their landing page
[00:55:16] <doug65536> document.getElementsByTagName('a')
[00:55:16] <doug65536> NodeList[182]
[00:58:22] <doug65536> grafi: probably because average users use the google search field as their address bar and they are lost without google.com
[00:58:34] <grafi> i am too
[00:58:38] <grafi> youtube crashed
[00:58:54] <grafi> i tried to google the "isitdownforeveryoneorjustme.com"
[00:58:58] <grafi> google is down
[00:59:02] <grafi> i was in tears
[00:59:03] <grafi> :D
[01:00:21] <doug65536> wow google hates www.isitdownforeveryoneorjustme.com
[01:00:42] <doug65536> the only search result is at www.countryidea.com/www.isitdownforeveryoneorjustme.com‎
[01:01:16] <grafi> xD
[01:01:20] <doug65536> ah, I see why, it's a fake search page
[01:01:44] <doug65536> their domain must have been snatched by domain squatters
[01:01:53] <grafi> i really should be coding :/
[01:01:58] <grafi> tooooo lazy
[01:02:20] <doug65536> I hate that smoothscroll plugin
[01:02:36] <grafi> why?
[01:02:42] <doug65536> hey web devs: if I wanted that crap I would have it turned on in native code
[01:02:50] <doug65536> because I prefer instant scroll
[01:03:00] <grafi> hm
[01:03:08] <grafi> disable js! ^^
[01:03:12] <doug65536> lol
[01:03:42] <doug65536> instant scroll is easier to read
[01:03:54] <doug65536> even with 2ms monitor text quality doesn't become perfect until it stops
[01:04:41] <doug65536> I've been staring at monitors for decades - I have no trouble whatsoever reading instant-scrolled stuff
[01:04:55] <horsik> is that your worst worry, really?
[01:05:14] <grafi> the most annoying one probably ^^
[01:05:15] <doug65536> horsik: what browser doesn't have native code smooth scroll?
[01:05:52] <horsik> how about pages with width fixed to more than your resolution?
[01:05:56] <doug65536> that's why I have issue with it. it takes away my ability to have instant scroll
[01:06:14] <doug65536> more than 1920x1080?
[01:06:15] <horsik> doesn't that annoy you more?
[01:06:30] <grafi> hahaha
[01:06:50] <doug65536> horsik: on a phone browser, sure that would be bad
[01:07:32] <horsik> i have 12" subnotebook with 1024
[01:07:42] <horsik> and i'm fucking pissed
[01:07:42] <grafi> sucknotebook
[01:07:45] <doug65536> horsik: yes I can see that being a problem
[01:07:46] <grafi> xD
[01:08:04] <grafi> what website are we talking about?
[01:08:14] <horsik> most of them
[01:08:20] <grafi> surely not
[01:08:27] <horsik> youtube for example?
[01:08:53] <doug65536> except big sites, most sites don't really have the content for 1920 wide - and people usually don't like a wall of text either...
[01:09:00] <grafi> i have "splitscreen" most of the time meaning about 950px window widht
[01:09:07] <grafi> i can view youtube without problems
[01:09:21] <doug65536> youtube is semi-fixed-width
[01:09:23] <grafi> so why would that be an isseu for you?
[01:09:33] <doug65536> it maxes out the actual content area nowhere near full screen
[01:09:43] <grafi> sadly
[01:10:14] <doug65536> one fascinating thing about youtube is it isn't centered like a typical site
[01:10:18] <doug65536> it says mostly left
[01:10:33] <doug65536> stays*
[01:10:52] <doug65536> same with google search results
[01:11:15] <horsik> it's kind of cool because content begins where it should
[01:11:39] <doug65536> yes, it feels so natural that i only realized that a month ago or so
[01:13:29] <grafi> xD
[01:14:26] <becom33> http://jsfiddle.net/H6HTR/1/ when I try it with a function it doesnt work . I want the function to be called on load as well as when u select option in the dropdown
[01:14:53] <grafi> i think there should be another video size
[01:15:04] <grafi> between middle and fullscreen
[01:15:05] <grafi> https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/43313739/yt.JPG
[01:15:14] <grafi> like when you have the browser on fullscreen
[01:16:05] <grafi> becom33 $('#apps').change(app_select); without the ()
[01:16:27] <horsik> why is comments section so wide compared to related videos?
[01:17:10] <grafi> wide?
[01:17:12] <grafi> you mean small
[01:17:13] <grafi> :o
[01:17:34] <horsik> yup
[01:18:03] <grafi> just looks that way because the video is bigger
[01:18:12] <grafi> its actually the same width as always
[01:20:06] <doug65536> there is small, medium, fullscreen
[01:20:12] <grafi> yeah
[01:20:13] <horsik> are you trying to say that when you use small player you have huge plain space on the right? :D
[01:20:14] <doug65536> you want a new size between full and medium?
[01:20:25] <becom33> is there a better way to this http://jsfiddle.net/H6HTR/5/ or is this alright ?
[01:20:51] <grafi> with the small player the related videos start beside the video container horsik
[01:21:09] <grafi> like in the image i posted doug65536 https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/43313739/yt.JPG
[01:21:23] <grafi> i'd call it supersized-medium
[01:21:24] <grafi> :D
[01:21:45] <doug65536> grafi: I would click it :)
[01:21:47] <horsik> grafi: i know but what's after related column, more to the right
[01:21:57] <grafi> whitespace
[01:22:00] <horsik> LOL
[01:22:10] <horsik> are you serious?
[01:22:24] <grafi> 100%
[01:22:59] <doug65536> becom33: that looks good, but as shown it doesn't go anywhere but into an inaccessible variable. was that just because you minimized the code?
[01:23:08] <horsik> i guess it's time to buy a new laptop
[01:23:31] <doug65536> another weird thing is, you do that on .ready, yet you expected the $('#apps') selector to work
[01:23:41] <becom33> doug65536, yea there are more this is just a example of somthing igot stuck with :)
[01:23:50] <horsik> or start using desktop because web looks so different to me
[01:23:55] <doug65536> becom33: looks good though, sure
[01:24:21] <becom33> doublerebel, well the thing I want the function run when the page load also when the user select a value on dropdown
[01:24:25] <grafi> horsik macbook retina ^^
[01:24:34] <grafi> and use software to get the full resolution xD
[01:24:39] <grafi> more whitespace for you
[01:25:09] <horsik> grafi: i wouldn't buy apple just for retina screen
[01:25:22] <doug65536> becom33: to be clear, as shown, that code won't work if it is loaded in <head> because $('#apps') doesn't exist yet
[01:25:31] <grafi> if not for retina, for what then?
[01:25:58] <becom33> doug65536, no the scripts are in the bottom of the page before the footer
[01:26:07] <doug65536> becom33: ok
[01:26:12] <becom33> that way page executions work faster
[01:26:12] <horsik> for nothing, that's why i wouldn't buy it :P
[01:26:20] <enigma> i have this code which would set the footer height, it's working fine, but the resize function isn't working. http://pastie.org/8244564 what am i doing wrong?
[01:26:45] <grafi> horsik: ha!
[01:26:52] <doug65536> becom33: that's actually an old practice. today, in head, it can get started asynchronously loading scripts earlier
[01:26:52] <horsik> well _maybe_ for that fancy power adapter plug :D
[01:27:21] <grafi> i like the os
[01:27:22] <grafi> :(
[01:27:24] <doug65536> becom33: not that big of a deal though
[01:27:25] <becom33> i see
[01:27:49] <horsik> i'm pretty happy with my debian+awesome
[01:28:03] <grafi> awesome?
[01:28:39] <doug65536> awesome is a super-lightweight desktop right?
[01:28:46] <grafi> ah
[01:28:47] <grafi> cool
[01:28:56] <horsik> yes desktop enviro
[01:29:38] <horsik> it's lightweight but best thing is that can be scripted the way you like
[01:29:39] <doug65536> I use mate on 6-core core-i7 990x extreme gtx 580
[01:29:43] <doug65536> mate is pretty light too :)
[01:29:58] <doug65536> gtx580 sli if linux drivers didn't suck so bad
[01:30:01] <grafi> i think im too shallow to use linux
[01:30:09] <doug65536> but I still use 2nd 580 for gpu compute stuff
[01:30:15] <grafi> the browsers look terrible
[01:30:32] <doug65536> grafi: are you kidding? linux text rendering is gorgeous!
[01:30:44] <grafi> not talking about text rendering though
[01:31:30] <doug65536> chrome is chrome. what's the difference
[01:31:36] <horsik> well you have up-to-date bulids for every browser for linix
[01:32:05] <horsik> so i don't know what bothers you
[01:32:18] <grafi> im searching images
[01:32:19] <grafi> :p
[01:32:29] <grafi> its really just a tiny detail
[01:32:36] <grafi> but it bothers me to no end
[01:32:53] <doug65536> I do C++ dev work too. now I realize why linux people are so condescending to windows devs. builds are much faster in linux, and it is far easier to setup libraries and dependencies
[01:33:05] <grafi> http://www.chip.de/ii/1/0/9/6/0/4/2/6/ff4ubuntu_t1-472ddfc7cc42ea1c.JPG buttons >.<
[01:33:23] <grafi> yeah doug65536
[01:33:41] <grafi> and im sad that tiny little details are keeping me somehow from ditching windows <.<
[01:33:47] <grafi> my life could be so much easier
[01:33:49] <grafi> :P
[01:33:56] <horsik> grafi: _everything_ of that can be customized
[01:34:05] <horsik> literally everything
[01:34:11] <grafi> but i dont want to customize it
[01:34:17] <grafi> i want it to look good
[01:34:34] <horsik> download another gtk3 theme then and you're done
[01:34:43] <doug65536> grafi: if you want to try a linux build that feels good to a windows user, try linux mint, mate desktop
[01:34:55] <grafi> i think i did
[01:35:05] <grafi> i have a little box here for trying out distros
[01:35:14] <grafi> just none of them ever sticks
[01:35:37] <grafi> its useful though to have a linux box around
[01:35:48] <grafi> last week i tried converting markdown to pdf
[01:35:52] <doug65536> I used ubuntu 12.10 for a while and it was just too heavyweight, even though my machine is really fast. I prefer no bs and mate is exactly that. fast as hell
[01:35:57] <grafi> try installing that on windows
[01:35:58] <grafi> <.<
[01:36:38] <doug65536> yes there is far more spyware and crappyware for windows
[01:37:13] <doug65536> next next next next, uncheck 3 spyware things, next, finish
[01:37:13] <grafi> well there are also tools that should just work
[01:37:27] <grafi> apt-get gadgetto gogo
[01:37:37] <grafi> but on windows the installation is a real pain
[01:38:26] <grafi> took me longer to boot the system than to convert the markdown into pdf ^^
[01:38:43] <grafi> after 30minutes of failing on windows
[01:38:54] <doug65536> they have to put those checkboxes in. if they don't it gets reclassified as malware and virus software will kill it. the loophole is, if users left it checked, virus software shouldn't kill it
[01:39:11] <grafi> ^^
[01:39:18] <grafi> try updating java
[01:39:19] <grafi> oô
[01:39:29] <grafi> f* that shit
[01:41:37] <horsik> i can't use windows anymore
[01:41:55] <horsik> lack of virtual desktops kills me
[01:42:15] <grafi> :)
[01:42:24] <doug65536> grafi: when I resize adjacent windows, the edges will snap if I slow down when they are close. a tiny thing, but a very nice thing
[01:42:33] <grafi> thats the 12" screen talking horsik
[01:42:34] <grafi> :D
[01:43:30] <doug65536> grafi: how about being able to pull down the window menu and pick "always on top" for EVERY window
[01:43:43] <grafi> what oô
[01:43:48] <doug65536> grafi: not just ones where the dev put an always on top option in
[01:44:08] <doug65536> I can put youtube always on top and have a maximized ide behind it and work
[01:44:29] <grafi> and not see anything that going on below the youtube?
[01:44:29] <grafi> ^^
[01:44:35] <doug65536> yes
[01:44:44] <grafi> sounds useless
[01:44:45] <grafi> :P
[01:45:09] <doug65536> I've wanted to always-on-top any window since windows 3.1
[01:45:11] <horsik> if you have big screen and you're a multitasker why not
[01:46:00] <doug65536> I have dual 1920x1080 27" monitors and I still use it :)
[01:46:02] <horsik> personally i often can't focus on writing code while listening to music
[01:46:11] <grafi> hm
[01:46:20] <grafi> i would think you're doing it wrong doug65536
[01:46:21] <grafi> but ok
[01:46:22] <grafi> P:
[01:46:42] <grafi> horsik depends on the code really
[01:46:55] <grafi> i almost always have music/youtube running
[01:47:04] <grafi> to drown the silence ^^
[01:47:35] <grafi> i turn it off when i really have to concentrate on some logic or something
[01:49:39] <doug65536> grafi: did I mention that the 1 million input field fiddle finished loading?
[01:49:59] <doug65536> took chrome 20 hours on core I7 990x extreme
[01:50:30] <grafi> yeah i saw it
[01:50:35] <grafi> xD
[01:50:52] <grafi> now half that
[01:50:58] <grafi> and see how much better chrome does
[01:51:05] <doug65536> firefox would have done it in minutes
[01:51:13] <grafi> you think?
[01:51:23] <doug65536> yes firefox js execution blows chrome out of the water
[01:51:50] <grafi> wasnt that always the other way around?
[01:51:50] <doug65536> I should try it...
[01:51:59] <grafi> im really not up to date on that
[01:53:30] <grafi> anyways run your test and come back to me ^^
[01:54:25] <doug65536> ok, started at 4:54...
[01:54:31] <doug65536> I bet it'll be done in no time
[01:56:23] <doug65536> it's probably O(n^2)
[01:58:13] <doug65536> I wonder if jquery does anything stupid in .append()
[01:58:24] <grafi> hm why do youtube videos always comapre mba and mbp retina oô
[01:58:29] <grafi> kind of pointless
[01:58:43] <doug65536> using x = x.insertAfter would probably be as close to O(1) as you can get
[01:59:16] <grafi> you should also test that doug65536
[01:59:17] <grafi> ^^
[01:59:40] <doug65536> if firefox makes an ass of chrome shortly, I definitely will :D
[02:04:36] <doug65536> BAM
[02:04:39] <doug65536> firefox is done
[02:04:51] <doug65536> 5:04
[02:05:07] <doug65536> grafi: ^
[02:05:29] <enigma> i have this code which would set the footer height, it's working fine, but the resize function isn't working. http://pastie.org/8244564 what am i doing wrong?
[02:06:01] <doug65536> grafi: 20 hrs (chrome) vs 9 minutes (firefox)
[02:06:08] <grafi> crazy
[02:06:17] <grafi> never would have guessed that
[02:06:44] <doug65536> grafi: yes, but chrome does have amazing page load times and other things are amazing. firefox js blows it away though
[02:06:57] <grafi> i agree
[02:07:43] <grafi> as long as you dont use IE im happy ^^
[02:08:00] <grafi> and by "you" i mean any user visiting my sites
[02:08:00] <linda> How to drag a horizontal element and drop it in a sliding box
[02:10:28] <doug65536> enigma: what resize function?
[02:10:44] <doug65536> enigma: sorry I see
[02:10:52] <enigma> umm
[02:10:55] <enigma> ok
[02:11:14] <enigma> the document.ready is working
[02:11:19] <doug65536> enigma: jQuery("html") looks odd
[02:11:31] <doug65536> enigma: shouldn't that be jQuery(document) ?
[02:11:42] <enigma> i tried that, it didn't work
[02:11:50] <enigma> some here said it isnt an "element"
[02:12:04] <doug65536> window isn't an element either is it
[02:12:25] <enigma> hmm i did try document but it want working either way
[02:12:44] <doug65536> enigma: precisely what does "not working" mean
[02:12:50] <doug65536> you get resize callbacks right?
[02:13:24] <enigma> when i resize the window, the footer gap height isnt adjusting
[02:13:30] <enigma> it remains the same, only when i refresh its ok
[02:14:01] <doug65536> enigma: of course, because you always assign negative height
[02:14:08] <doug65536> is there a scrollbar?
[02:14:27] <enigma> no the height of the document is less than the height of window
[02:14:30] <enigma> that's what i am checking
[02:14:34] <enigma> and there is no negative height
[02:14:47] <doug65536> what is the css of the footer
[02:14:50] <clarkk> I am trying to create an effect similar to this, but where the panel does not displace the rest of the page's content.
[02:14:50] <clarkk> http://arungudelli.webuda.com/Slidepanel/sidepane.html (dismiss the advert)
[02:14:52] <doug65536> is it positioned?
[02:14:58] <enigma> no it isnt
[02:14:59] <enigma> static
[02:15:06] <enigma> default
[02:15:14] <doug65536> enigma: then height has no effect
[02:15:23] <enigma> i have made an if condition there, if html height is less than window height
[02:15:34] <clarkk> I have no idea what approach to even take. If I try to make the panel fixed, then the panel and button do not stay together in the animation
[02:15:40] <enigma> height has no effect ? but its working when document is loaded
[02:15:46] <clarkk> could someone give me some guidance please?
[02:15:49] <enigma> only in resize it isnt resizing
[02:16:31] <doug65536> enigma: put position: relative in the footer css. humor me
[02:16:47] <doug65536> enigma: so you can come back and tell me haha it didn't work
[02:16:58] <enigma> it's there already
[02:17:02] <enigma> oops
[02:17:07] <enigma> yes its there
[02:17:28] <doug65536> is it on a page I can look at online?
[02:17:44] <doug65536> PM me if you are wary
[02:17:48] <enigma> umm no
[02:17:52] <enigma> ok hold on i will upload it
[02:18:13] <enigma> the console isnt showing any error either
[02:18:33] <doug65536> enigma: I'm pretty good in debugger. let me give it a shot
[02:18:51] <enigma> http://buildpreview.net/_preview/ac/
[02:19:28] <patsToms> zeburn foundation have some goode module based code. Any resources how to write my code like that?
[02:19:28] <enigma> i don't have a "large" screen so using another tool to check it :(
[02:20:23] <patsToms> for example https://gist.github.com/patsToms/8827813dd6b992ce44e7
[02:23:12] <doug65536> enigma: well one apparent problem is the height of the footer is part of the height of the html
[02:23:36] <doug65536> enigma: shouldn't you get the .position().top of the footer and treat that as the end of the document?
[02:24:07] <grafi> clarkk http://jsfiddle.net/mstoppert/ZVWgw/ something like this maybe?
[02:24:13] <enigma> doug65536: omg good point
[02:24:38] <enigma> .position().top returns a value ?
[02:25:01] <doug65536> $('.footer-gap').position().top
[02:25:12] <doug65536> it is the position in pixels relative to the whole document
[02:25:35] <clarkk> grafi: wow that is cool - so simple! I will experiment with it. Thank you!!
[02:26:42] <grafi> clarkk good luck
[02:28:06] <enigma> i did it on footer..i think that worked...
[02:34:41] <clarkk> grafi: that is good, but it's not ideal. I'm afraid this is part of the problem that I am trying to solve. The toggle of the panel should be visible when the panel is closed. Having a second toggle button that remains static looks quite fudgy
[02:36:24] <grafi> yeah clarkk im experimenting with this now
[02:36:43] <clarkk> grafi: it's tricky, isn't it? ;)
[02:38:05] <clarkk> grafi: however, the previous solution was helpful. I like the use of the toggle class to allow two elements to act as a trigger
[02:38:25] <grafi> well its surely a start
[02:39:14] <clarkk> grafi: yes it is!
[02:44:10] <linda> Is it to drag a horizontal element and drop it in a vertical element?
[02:44:51] <doug65536> linda: what?
[02:47:52] <grafi> clarkk this could work too http://jsfiddle.net/mstoppert/ZVWgw/2/ no second toggle neccessary, needs some fine tuning though
[02:48:14] <grafi> and im afk
[02:56:57] <clarkk> grafi: what is the class "open" that you add. Does this contain any properties?
[03:33:40] <clarkk> grafi: would you mind letting me know when you are back?
[03:36:50] <t3_> hi
[03:37:16] <t3_> If someone has a minute to have a look at something I'd appreciate it
[03:37:25] <t3_> I've followed the example from http://stackoverflow.com/a/6581750/1304661 exactly
[03:37:46] <t3_> but when I click the browse button I don't get prompted to select a file
[03:38:37] <clarkk> t3_: which browsers have you used for testing?
[03:38:45] <t3_> I'm just using firefox right now
[03:38:53] <clarkk> is it the same in chrome?
[03:39:19] <t3_> I don't have access to chrome, I have safari though - i'll try that
[03:39:46] <clarkk> t3_: what do you mean by you don't have access to chrome?
[03:39:50] <t3_> nope - no joy there either
[03:39:57] <clarkk> t3_: just install it ;)
[03:40:06] <t3_> I don't have chrome installed - to be honest, this only needs to run in firefox
[03:40:20] <clarkk> still useful for testing tho
[03:40:34] <clarkk> t3_: http://portableapps.com/apps/internet/google_chrome_portable
[03:40:42] <clarkk> t3_: do you have the code live?
[03:40:45] <t3_> no
[03:40:49] <clarkk> on a public server?
[03:40:49] <t3_> it's on another computer
[03:40:55] <t3_> only on my local network
[03:41:00] <clarkk> ah ok
[03:41:10] <t3_> the bit in question is copied directly from the stackoverflow article anyway
[03:41:26] <t3_> I wonder if it has something do with the "class="display-none" "
[03:42:08] <t3_> by the way for a bit of context, i'm just trying to stylise a file browse button
[03:42:14] <t3_> I can't believe it's so damn complicated
[03:42:21] <clarkk> t3_: use firebug to disable that class
[03:42:53] <t3_> just manually disabling that class makes it work in safari
[03:42:55] <t3_> but not firefox
[03:43:04] <t3_> but anyway, i need the file browse thing to be disabled
[03:43:09] <t3_> sorry
[03:43:12] <t3_> disabled is a bad word
[03:43:15] <t3_> hidden
[03:43:21] <t3_> so I can have my own styled button instead
[03:44:31] <t3_> if you know of another jquery solution to this that could work i'm all ears, i've exhausted the css options I can think of
[03:44:56] <clarkk> I'm sorry, I'm pretty new to this
[03:45:04] <t3_> yeah, i'm new to jquery too
[03:50:36] <t3_> clarkk: is there a way to simulate double click in jquery?
[03:50:45] <t3_> like .click() obviously is single
[03:50:51] <t3_> but is there a doubleClick() equivalent?
[03:51:14] <clarkk> t3_: .dblclick()
[03:51:51] <t3_> I thought that was going to do it :(
[03:53:04] <t3_> $('#something') references something with 'something' as an ID right?
[03:53:19] <t3_> is there anything that can be used to reference something with a NAME of 'something'?
[03:54:47] <clarkk> t3_: what do you mean by name?
[03:55:01] <t3_> <input name="test" type="file" />
[03:55:13] <t3_> something that will hit up a control with a NAME of test
[03:55:39] <clarkk> t3_: I think it supports css-style selectors http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/selector.html
[03:56:10] <clarkk> t3_: http://api.jquery.com/attribute-equals-selector/
[04:01:23] <ivanov_jaroslaw> Hello! May you help me with fadeIn/fadeOut? In this slider http://heavenweb.ru/demo/hwslider/index.html I see something strange. If I clicked on arrow - animation was slow. But if I clicked on radionbutton, which matched with displayed picture (if there is a picture 2 - click on radiobutton 2) - animation was very slow. Why different?
[04:02:17] <ivanov_jaroslaw> so, I need animation like very slow) it is more beautiful)
[04:03:03] <ivanov_jaroslaw> fadeIn and fadeOut value is eq - 700. but there is different
[04:05:21] <ivanov_jaroslaw> do you understand me?)
[04:05:55] <ivanov_jaroslaw> i saw code, but i don't understand, why appears very slow animation
[04:12:08] <t3_> clarkk - seems to work okay on a newer version of firefox
[04:23:27] <clarkk> t3_: You mean you aren't using the latest version of FF? Ummm....why? :/
[04:29:06] <Phlow> http://jsfiddle.net/UxHpU/11/    <- Anyone have an idea how I can make the dropdown appear outside of the div?
[04:34:26] <t3_> clarkk... it's on another computer
[04:34:32] <t3_> hasn't been used for a while
[04:34:43] <t3_> do you know CSS?
[04:43:38] <clarkk> t3_: #protip: ensure your environment is up to scratch before you sit down to develop
[04:43:42] <clarkk> t3_: a bit
[04:44:28] <t3_> I was trying to find a way to only display that change if the user is using firefox and default to the normal behaviour if they are using another browser
[04:48:59] <clarkk> t3_: and you were using a legacy browser...because?
[05:05:56] <grafi> clarkk its just a toggle to check if the slider is open or not
[05:11:14] <spobat> hi
[05:11:32] <spobat> how can i stop the flimmering|blinking if i hover the text on the right hand side? http://jsfiddle.net/4ZRrb/
[05:12:01] <spobat> it's weird and i just want the image to show then, without any blinking. Yet I understand the cause, but have no appropriate solution.
[05:12:25] <spobat> oh, nevermind
[05:16:31] <jop008> I use this td {   text-align:center;
[05:16:32] <jop008> }
[05:16:42] <spobat> var $overlay = $('#magnify-image-overlay');
[05:16:42] <spobat>         $('#magnify-image-overlay, .image-message').hover
[05:16:44] <spobat> can i combine these?
[05:16:47] <jop008> but no center of text in column
[05:16:58] <spobat> jop008: live example?
[05:17:02] <spobat> also, this is css
[05:19:00] <ravenzz> is it safe to select the html element passing document.documentElement instead of the string 'html' ?
[05:19:16] <ravenzz> $(document.documentElement) vs $('html')
[05:20:59] <spobat> there is also $(document)
[05:21:13] <clarkk> grafi: ah, good point. Is there any way to keep the state of a variable in between clicks?
[05:21:34] <clarkk> grafi: so rather than using a class, you use a boolean variable
[05:21:43] <ravenzz> spobat I don't think it returns the html element
[05:21:58] <gry> Hi. Inside of html.find('a').attr('href', function(i, attr) {}), how do I access value of the class attribute of the a element?
[05:22:57] <jop008> when I put <td style='text-align:center'> in every td tag it worked but css must be shorter
[05:25:25] <jop008> I shoudl say with td {ext-algin="center" it must work also
[05:59:37] <Dumle29> Hey there. I'm really scratching my head on this one, and hoped to find a guru in here :P
[05:59:53] <Dumle29> I have a very very hard time triggering on a link on my site :/
[06:00:29] <Dumle29> hmm, seems i also cache at the momen >:( I hate that :P
[06:01:45] <Dumle29> If you want, the site is at: http://vtglan.dk
[06:01:57] <Dumle29> no derp, it's at http://vtglan.net
[06:03:19] <Dumle29> oh and I have my problem nice and descriped here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18271592/using-jquery-on-an-element-generated-by-ajax-triggered-by-a-link-in-an-iframe-i
[06:04:02] <grafi> clarkk the class is a boolean variable, but sure you could also toggle a "real" variable in your js
[06:04:59] <clarkk> grafi: I've tried it with a variable, but because you have to define it at the start of the jquery script, it keeps getting defined with the original value every time the script runs
[06:11:51] <grafi> clarkk http://jsfiddle.net/mstoppert/ZVWgw/7/ there you go
[06:12:36] <clarkk> grafi: ahh, so that's how you do it! Thanks!! :)

[07:16:39] <qqqq_z> Hi. I want to show part of my website on a projector, and part on the user's screen. Is it possible to synchronize two windows in the browser, so that I can accomplish this?
[07:21:55] <blib1> knock
[07:24:29] <duckgoose> blib1
[07:25:11] <blib1> Are there any newer libraries that one can consider to replace DOM manipulation  (smaller and better) than jquery?
[07:25:58] <grafi> why dont you ask a ruby channel if they can suggest you any php libraries xD
[07:26:31] <patsToms> seems like question about closure http://jsbin.com/aVAmAz/1/edit
[07:26:39] <blib1> js please :)
[07:26:56] <duckgoose> I think it's a matter of preference really
[07:27:06] <duckgoose> IMO jquery is the best one
[07:27:10] <clarkk> when chaining jquery methods, is it guaranteed that method is complete before the next one starts?
[07:27:12] <patsToms> so, how to change settings.speed at each? any ideas?
[07:27:54] <duckgoose> There's also Prototype, Ext, Dojo Toolkit, MooTools, Script.aculo.us
[07:28:12] <patsToms> blib1, check zapto
[07:28:25] <grafi> http://zeptojs.com/ zepto
[07:28:31] <patsToms> oh, sorry
[07:28:35] <grafi> ;)
[07:28:47] <patsToms> there is sqLite too
[07:29:01] <blib1> sqlite?
[07:29:05] <blib1> zepto looks good
[07:29:07] <patsToms> omg
[07:29:07] <grafi> as a js lib?
[07:29:09] <patsToms> sorry people
[07:29:10] <patsToms>  :D
[07:29:12] <patsToms> jqlite
[07:29:13] <clarkk> grafi: you know that code you gave me? Why did you use different ways of applying the css after the slideDown and slideUp methods, please?
[07:29:37] <grafi> because it looked wonky the other way
[07:29:45] <patsToms> I just need some rest :(
[07:30:11] <clarkk> grafi: why not use .end.css in the second, or use a function as a parameter to slideDown in the first?
[07:30:20] <grafi> the slideUp waits until the animation is done, then executes the css change as a callback
[07:30:32] <grafi> i had that at first
[07:30:43] <grafi> but the css was changed before the animation was done
[07:30:50] <grafi> so it didnt look good
[07:30:50] <clarkk> right
[07:31:01] <grafi> its certainly not perfect now
[07:31:20] <grafi> but its a lot better than with the normal chaining, i think
[07:33:28] <clarkk> yes it gives me a starting point. I appreciate it, grafi
[07:33:36] <grafi> no problem
[07:33:56] <grafi> i think if you find a way to reserve that space at the top the toggle takes up
[07:34:04] <grafi> it looks quite good
[07:34:37] <grafi> and the text wont jump up and down anymore
[07:35:00] <grafi> just finding a good way to do that could be hard :p
[07:37:18] <patsToms> so anyone about my problem?
[07:37:21] <patsToms> http://jsbin.com/aVAmAz/1/edit
[07:37:50] <patsToms> I want to change settings.speed into jQuery's each
[07:38:17] <patsToms> where this is not the object's this
[07:38:22] <chee> wtf internet
[07:43:14] <grafi> patsToms what?

[07:45:30] <patsToms> http://jsbin.com/uyEJeDu/2/edit
[07:46:01] <patsToms> how can even this work
[07:52:42] <grafi> why shouldnt it?
[07:53:22] <patsToms> because t is this, but how changing t changes real this?
[07:54:52] <geoffw8_> Hello all. I have an app, when you click "Follow" the follower count gets incremented. Whats the best practice way to do it, use a selector, i.e. #follower-count-store-123 or using find() from the button?
[07:57:01] <grafi> because t is this, this changes when t changes
[08:00:26] <duckgoose> it doesn't matter which you use
[08:00:43] <duckgoose> .find will look for the same thing
[08:02:26] <duckgoose> personally I'd do .find() so I don't have the clutter up html
[08:02:35] <duckgoose> with classes and ids and such
[08:03:50] <duckgoose> but if your element has a unique id/class then no point in doing .find
[08:05:47] <duckgoose> don't use a class though if you do it that way

[08:12:56] <clime> hey, guys I need some advice about selecting by data attr. I construct options into a select like this:         var option = $('<option></option>').attr('value', m).text(text).data('marker-id', marker.id);  The problem is that i can't search by data-marker-id. $('#id_main_destination option[data-marker-id=1]') returns empty list and it should return one of the options.
[08:14:16] <duckgoose> $("#id_main_destination option[data-marker-id='1']")
[08:14:32] <duckgoose> give that a go
[08:15:32] <clime> duckgoose: that does not work either. I just dicovered that it works if I set data attr like this: .attr('data-marker-id', marker.id); instead of data('marker-id', marker.id)
[08:17:35] <clime> With attr I can see the data attr in my element inspector. With data it does not appear. Only when I do $('#id_main_destination option').eq(1).data() I can see it has been set

[08:32:14] <gourav> see i want to make an ajax call
[08:32:15] <deviantp> sure, well the snippet of html there is a list of about 202 items, I need all the fields, even the last <td> with no class or ID.
[08:32:22] <gourav> store the value returned by the call
[08:32:26] <deviantp> duckgoose, the whole HTML is huuuuuuge
[08:32:34] <gourav> and then use that value to display a grid
[08:32:49] <gourav> but all i get in the variable is undefined
[08:34:28] <duckgoose> gourav do you define the variable outside of the ajax call?
[08:34:44] <deviantp> duckgoose, ok..I hacked the html apart a bit more, pasted in the missing start of table and it's working! grr *hits head*
[08:34:57] <duckgoose> if you define a variable inside the ajax call it's only going to be defined within that function
[08:35:35] <deviantp> duckgoose, but I'm still in the situation of not knowing the best way of trying to get the data out!
[08:36:24] <duckgoose> define a global variable and set it as the data when it comes in
[08:36:37] <duckgoose> or make a function and pass the data along to it when it comes in
[08:39:14] <duckgoose> deviantp http://pastebin.com/5yuCKuXL
[08:39:16] <deviantp> aaaawesome.. nailed it!! cheers duckgoose
[08:40:11] <deviantp> ( http://pastebin.com/5yuCKuXL )
[08:40:41] <deviantp> was that for someone else?
[08:41:12] <duckgoose> no, just an example of getting the data out ajaxing
[08:42:19] <duckgoose> if you were to do something like var the_data = data; inside the ajax call then it won't set the global variable as the data
[08:42:25] <aksu> http://pastebin.com/4xzhU1yz that works on firefox but chrome fails... What's Wrong?
[08:42:32] <deviantp> ahh.. sure not gourav he was asking about Ajax :)
[08:42:43] <deviantp> i fixed my problem like this http://jsfiddle.net/RxLm2/3/
[08:43:06] <duckgoose> woops :P
[08:43:11] <duckgoose> need some glasses I guess
[08:43:42] <duckgoose> deviantp I'd do it much the same
[08:44:34] <deviantp> ok, and just one last question (purely for best code practice) what would be the easiest way to get the values into variables based on the itemName ... I can play around and get it to work, but sometimes it helps to know the best practice from the offset!
[08:45:20] <deviantp> (psuedo code is acceptable) ;)
[08:48:01] <clarkk> grafi: you still here?
[08:51:32] <enigma> hello, what is the best way to go about with responsive js, there is a slider i have which i want it to output in a certain way in different screen sizes, i know it can be done by loading 2-3 sliders and then show the one which is needed to show through css, but that would load all the sliders, so i want something like if screen resoluton this then load this, keeping in mind the window resize
[08:51:32] <enigma> function also
[08:52:50] <deviantp> came up with this if anyone thats been following cares to comment http://jsfiddle.net/RxLm2/4/
[08:55:16] <duckgoose> are you trying to get the item name only
[08:57:36] <aksu> http://pastebin.com/4xzhU1yz that works on firefox but chrome fails... What's Wrong?
[08:57:50] <duckgoose> deviantp the code looks fine to me
[08:58:37] <deviantp> awesome, I couldn't find a way of skipping the var declaration though... like "if (index%4 = 0)" is that not possible?
[08:59:20] <deviantp> i had to declare it x = index%4 and use that in the If statement
[08:59:29] <duckgoose> if (index%4 == 0)  doesn't do it?
[09:00:35] <deviantp> ok yeah it does, must have had a typo :]
[09:01:03] <deviantp> thanks duckgoose, you've been really helpful
[09:05:48] <grafi> yes clarkk
[09:06:13] <clarkk> grafi: let me show you how far I've got. It's looking better
[09:07:30] <aksu> :/ this is annoying
[09:08:21] <scar> im creating a button at the top of my site on a fixed bar that says "Login". when clicked, i have a div appear to have a login form. whats the best way to get this to go away, outside of setting an on click on the active button?
[09:08:32] <scar> i would think if a user clicks anywhere outside of the div
[09:08:35] <scar> but how?
[09:09:21] <aksu> twitter bootstrap has solution for yyour problem
[09:11:19] <scar> ehh seems like a lot for what i want
[09:11:37] <scar> is it expensive to check for all mouseclicks and checking to see if the target, per se, is my selector?
[09:12:26] <clarkk> grafi: http://jsfiddle.net/ZVWgw/12/  omg, I just that second fixed the problem that was bugging me!
[09:13:19] <clarkk> grafi: there were two issues. One was that there was an 8px gap above the toggle-button. Also, the text of the button would jump slightly horizontally at the end of the slide
[09:13:42] <clarkk> grafi: I just fixed both by chance, by setting margin and padding on the body to zero

[09:16:25] <grafi> clarkk good job :p
[09:16:42] <clarkk> grafi: thanks mate! Could not have done it without you :)
[09:17:57] <grafi> probably not true :P
[09:18:01] <clarkk> haha
[09:18:12] <clarkk> thanks a grafi :)
[09:18:16] <clarkk> *thanks a lot
[09:19:55] <clarkk> grafi: question - what is static positioning for? MDN says it is the "normal behavior" but surely relative is the normal behavior?
[09:20:24] <clarkk> grafi: the reason I ask is because you chose to use that in your code
[09:26:07] <grafi> i think static is actually the normal behaviour
[09:26:14] <grafi> thats why i chose it anyways
[09:26:26] <grafi> because you have to get back from absolute somehow :P
[09:26:35] <grafi> relative should work fine though
[09:27:02] <grafi> but the static is just to get back to an element that is actually in the flow of the page
[09:27:12] <grafi> and not detached like the position: absolute is
[09:30:01] <clarkk> grafi: hmm, mdn states that The top, right, bottom, and left properties do not apply.   https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/position I thought that they always worked by default?
[09:30:12] <x26s> Using jQuery tabs for five sections opens flexible tab content window. Accordions for the sections has fixed content window height. How to correct this?
[09:30:19] <clarkk> grafi: (with static, I mean)
[09:30:27] <LoneSoldier728> hm wierd position how do I say if something wrap this around in a tags?
[09:30:47] <LoneSoldier728> in jade?
[09:31:51] <grafi> nope try setting left: 500px on a normal diff without a special position set
[09:31:56] <grafi> wont do a thing
[09:32:34] <LoneSoldier728> nvm got it

[09:33:34] <x26s> jQuery problem: Using jQuery tabs for multiple sections opens flexible tab content window. Accordions for the sections has fixed content window height, the height being that of the lenthiest section. How to correct this?
[09:37:39] <aksu> i dont know about that scar, i just give an example...
[09:39:37] <scar> i saw your example
[09:41:40] <clarkk> grafi: you are right of course. oops :(
[09:43:02] <grafi> i would hope so
[09:43:03] <grafi> :p
[10:08:54] <Whirl3d> if you have a list of elements that are all siblings and you only know the "active" one, can you still use .next() like this: $(".myclass.active").next() or is it $(".myclass").siblings().next();  ?
[10:11:54] <shoky> wat
[10:13:25] <Whirl3d> hey shoky! I'm currently getting the index of the "active" element, adding one, checking the length of the jqobject that contains all of the elements and ......I was hoping to skip all that mess with .next() or .prev() somehow
[10:15:23] <shoky> not such a mess..  var curIndex = (activeIndex + 1) % elems.length;
[10:16:16] <Whirl3d> I swear I have the hardest time remembering how to make the % work correctly. LOL Thanks. That's better.

[15:38:47] <hyperkign> Is anyone available?
[15:39:11] <UraniumSteel> I am, but all I have is questions - lol
[15:40:56] <UraniumSteel> one of which is on "activate" function for the Accordion widget - which is supposed to fire AFTER the accordion panel has been animated open -
[15:41:11] <UraniumSteel> but which seems to be firing before the animation is finished
[15:41:37] <hyperkign> UraniumSteel: lol, yeah
[15:41:57] <UraniumSteel> What's your question hyperkign?
[15:44:59] <hyperkign> I have variables embeded into my html but my external script doesn't seem to find it...Im getting an error that my var is not defined
[15:45:50] <UraniumSteel> Are you checking to make sure your document is loaded before your javascript fires?  Take a look at jQuery's $(document).ready() ?
[15:46:55] <hyperkign> yeah i have that. i do console.log(varname); from my external script, but i get varname is not defined
[15:48:22] <hyperkign> UraniumSteel: here is a fiddle http://jsfiddle.net/zsbQa/
[15:50:09] <hyperkign> http://jsfiddle.net/zsbQa/3/
[15:53:03] <UraniumSteel> Never used jsfiddle before interesting - but it's not reading the HTML javascript for me - let me copy to a local file
[16:02:02] <UraniumSteel> Okay, some questions - when is your external javascript functions firing?  right away?
[16:03:42] <hyperkign> yes it fires when page loads
[16:04:36] <UraniumSteel> Okay, then it looks like it is firing before your document is ready.   Your embedded js in the html file fires under your document.ready but your functions in your external files are firing before ?
[16:08:50] <hyperkign> the external js file runs before the embedded js
[16:26:35] <UraniumSteel> It can - it runs as soon as it's loaded into the browser.  and from my experience yes - the external.js file typically runs before embedded - you always have to take into account document.load
[16:28:31] <UraniumSteel> Anybody have knowledge of activate function (not 'active' but activate) on Jqueryui accordion?
[16:31:52] <UraniumSteel> hyperkign: you may want to take your "embedded" js and move it into your external file - same same
[16:32:20] <shoky> UraniumSteel: make a jsfiddle demo of your jqui problem
[16:36:53] <UraniumSteel> http://jsfiddle.net/XS4jG/2/
[16:37:27] <UraniumSteel> The problem is that on the "activate" function which is supposed to fire AFTER the accordion panel is finished seems to be firing before - as some of the items are not available yet or not there.
[16:38:05] <UraniumSteel> I need to remove some styling JQueryUI puts in for the accordion panel specifically overflow:auto
[16:41:14] <shoky> UraniumSteel: i have no idea what you're doing there especially with the styling (you're not even including jquery-ui css)
[16:41:28] <shoky> UraniumSteel: but the 'activate' callback is being called after the animation finishes
[16:42:38] <UraniumSteel> - in my activate function I have a line that removes "overflow" with $(uinewPanel).css("overflow","hidden");    But this does not seem to work - overflow is still set to auto from the accordion
[16:42:59] <UraniumSteel> I have the Jquery css linked in the real application - just not using it for this test
[16:43:51] <shoky> you have ui.newpanel instead of ui.newPanel
[16:45:39] <UraniumSteel> Thanks!         I'll just crawl over into the corner here and be quiet
[16:45:53] <shoky> ;p

[17:14:11] <ernston> hello
[17:16:25] <MarkyC> If I have a table with a link in one of the cells, how can I determine the id of the table in which the link was clicked? ie: <table id="1"><tr><td><a href="#"></a></td></tr></table> <table id="2"><tr><td><a href="#"></a></td></tr></table>. When I click the link, I want an alert saying "Table 1" or "Table 2".
[17:17:03] <gry> Hi. Inside of html.find('a').attr('href', function(i, attr) {}), how do I access value of the class attribute of the 'a' element? Thanks.
[17:17:04] <MarkyC> Or possibly: How can I get the id of a parent element of a link?
[17:19:01] <Es0teric> i am using unslider and i want to be able to "jump" to a slide... how would i go about doing that/
[17:19:11] <UraniumSteel> MarkyC: Use javascript - onclick event inside of link  <a href="#" onclick="myfunc();">My Link</a>  Then in myfunc use Jquery to get the parent and remove
[17:19:25] <MarkyC> gry: $("a").attr("class") returns the attribute
[17:19:57] <MarkyC> UraniumSteel: That's the part I'm uncertain about, how to I get the parent?
[17:20:11] <MarkyC> how /do/ I get the parent* sorry
[17:20:31] <gry> MarkyC: Literally "a", or do I replaec it with something? I would think passing an element to it could be more complex than that.
[17:20:37] <gry> replace*
[17:21:24] <UraniumSteel>  .parent() function in Jquery - inside of myfunc() use $(this).paren(); //I think
[17:21:39] <UraniumSteel> Sorry - $(this).parent();
[17:22:17] <MarkyC> gry: Depends what you want to do. My code gives you the classes for the /first/ link of your page
[17:22:23] <UraniumSteel> Jquery parent -> http://api.jquery.com/parent/‎
[17:22:29] <MarkyC> gry: if you want all links, use each()
[17:22:49] <gry> MarkyC: Well, I'm already looping over them, like I pasted earlier. Just trying to access the element from inside the {}s.
[17:23:54] <MarkyC> UraniumSteel: Ahh, so I can use a selector: $("a").parent("table").attr("id")
[17:24:56] <MarkyC> gry: Ahh, I see. Let me try to fiddle an example up. I'm learning too so this is good practice
[17:25:45] <gry> Probably a[4~[D thing I should have done, I think.
[17:28:02] <MarkyC> gry: http://jsfiddle.net/VwTsK/
[17:28:12] <MarkyC> gry: Using $(this) solves the problem
[17:28:43] <gry> Ok, thanks, I'll try.
[17:30:40] <gry> It works.
[17:39:31] <Krambiorix> hi, in every div i have a number like, 40000, 4000, 40001 , 1700, 1000, 100001 and i want to sort them but i want 100001 to be shown before 1000 and 40001 to be shown before 4000... How can i do that?
[17:42:55] <MarkyC> UraniumSteel: Could you give me a hand with my code, I'm getting undefined as as result: http://jsfiddle.net/UgXDb/1/
[17:44:50] <MarkyC> Krambiorix: it looks like str.length should be one of your sorting criteria
[17:45:06] <UraniumSteel> MarkyC: looking at it now
[17:45:48] <Krambiorix> MarkyC, yeah but the numbers should also make sense...
[17:46:20] <UraniumSteel> MarkyC: Use parents(); not parent().  Parent only goes up one level - parents (plural) travels until found or end of DOM
[17:46:50] <UraniumSteel> alert($(this).parents("table").attr("id"));
[17:47:40] <MarkyC> Krambiorix: This is more of an algorithmic problem then a jquery question. Does 40011 come before or after 40001?
[17:47:57] <Krambiorix> MarkyC, after
[17:48:13] <ernston> hello ,
[17:48:13] <moegreen> hey guys this might be a long shot but does anybody here have experience with sponsorflip that can help me?
[17:49:21] <MarkyC> Krambiorix: How about 4000? I think you want Bucket Sort, where the buckets are divided based on the first number in the string
[17:49:23] <UraniumSteel> Krambiorix: you have numeric sorting 1,2,3...10,11,12...110,111,112 and alpha/character sorting  1,10,11,110,111,2,20 (because 1 character is before 2 character so 100 comes before 20
[17:49:38] <gry> ernston: hi!
[17:49:54] <Krambiorix> MarkyC, any example of this?
[17:49:55] <MarkyC> UraniumSteel: Thanks again. That works
[17:50:03] <UraniumSteel> np
[17:50:15] <Krambiorix> UraniumSteel, i guess i'm not the first one with that problem....
[17:51:04] <MarkyC> Krambiorix: Unless UraniumSteel's method works for you. Bucket Sort is a common computer algorithm, Wikipedia might be a good start: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bucket_sort
[17:52:05] <UraniumSteel> Krambiorix: Nope, common Computer Science issue - sorting numerically vs by character - many sorting functions in programming languages allow you to specify which sorting "approach" you want..or it defaults based on data type.
[17:52:23] <UraniumSteel> if you have numeric data type then you get numeric sorting, and character sorting for string data type
[17:53:32] <UraniumSteel> Krambiorix: for your specific question -> do you want descending numeric?
[17:54:11] <Krambiorix> UraniumSteel, ascending
[17:54:51] <UraniumSteel> You also have to watch for blanks and/or nulls at end if using string data - this causes coding / sorting issues also.
[17:55:19] <Krambiorix> UraniumSteel, i don't have any idea how to start
[17:55:32] <UraniumSteel> but you wanted 40001 to be shown before 4000?  Can you give me a list of how they should appear?
[17:58:10] <UraniumSteel> Sorry, got disconnected
[17:58:35] <Krambiorix> 100017,10001,100,40001,4000, ...
[17:58:54] <Krambiorix> the "longer" the number the smaller in its series
[17:59:13] <ernston> hello, can anyone help with a form issue
[17:59:15] <ernston> http://jsfiddle.net/TnDha/51/
[17:59:52] <ernston> each input element works independently
[18:00:36] <ernston> wrong page sorry,
[18:00:54] <ernston> http://jsfiddle.net/TnDha/52/ <------ the search element does not work with the other elements
[18:03:09] <Whirl3d> what should it do?
[18:04:29] <ernston> is that to me Whirl3d ?
[18:04:30] <UraniumSteel> Krambiorix: but if same length then numeric sort?
[18:04:37] <Krambiorix> UraniumSteel, yes
[18:04:51] <Whirl3d> erston, yes, sorry
[18:05:12] <ernston> basically the 3 types of search all work
[18:05:22] <ernston> search input / slider  /  checkbox's
[18:05:27] <ernston> if you type in: abr
[18:05:34] <ernston> you get 2 results, which is correct
[18:05:58] <ernston> then if you click, Spacecake, the results should filter to 1
[18:06:11] <ernston> or if you move the slider to a number, it resets the list
[18:06:20] <ernston> am trying to get the 3 input types to work as one
[18:06:29] <ernston> i hope this makes sense
[18:07:25] <UraniumSteel> Krambiorix: you need to use javascript sort function on an array - put your values in an array for example: var points = ["40","100","1","5","25","10","4001","1001"];
[18:07:42] <Whirl3d> ernston in your change handler for the searchfield, you need to include the rating and services field options.
[18:07:45] <UraniumSteel> then use the sort function: points.sort(function(a,b){if (a.length == b.length) return a>b; else return a.length <b.length});
[18:08:10] <UraniumSteel> Which says if string length is the same sort numerically otherwise sort by length
[18:08:18] <ernston>  $('fieldset.search_services')  ?
[18:09:06] <Whirl3d> gimme just a minute
[18:09:53] <ernston> np am just fiddling to see what i can do
[18:17:08] <Whirl3d> ernston, the easiest way to do this is probably going to be to select only the visible menu options to filter each filter rule against.
[18:17:46] <Whirl3d> erston, so instead of using the entire list in each input field, only use the visible elements.
[18:17:52] <ernston> yeah
[18:18:00] <ernston> so if you type in: abr
[18:18:01] <ernston> you get 2
[18:18:04] <ernston> then from that 2
[18:18:12] <ernston> only 1 sells Spacecake
[18:18:16] <ernston> so it will result in 1
[18:18:23] <ernston> is that what your thinking?
[18:19:04] <ernston> at the moment enabling the spacecake checkbox shows ALL shops selling cake, ignoring the 'abr' search input , which is not good
[18:19:08] <Whirl3d> You are going to have a centralize your filter function
[18:19:25] <ernston> i have no idea what that means
[18:19:47] <Whirl3d> so when you change the input on any of them, it selects all of the fields that match the first. Then selects all of the result of the first search for the second, and so on.
[18:19:47] <ernston> am searching for examples as we speak
[18:20:03] <ernston> yeah that sounds right
[18:20:12] <ernston> but the Q is how
[18:20:14] <ernston> and how hard is it
[18:21:30] <Whirl3d> so each of your input elements (slider, whatever) has a handler that says, "$("#searchfield").on("change", updateList);   and $("#slider").change(updateList) .....all three ONLY call the updateList function
[18:22:08] <ernston> let me check this thanx
[18:22:48] <ernston> so create a updateList function ? ;s
[18:23:14] <Whirl3d> yes. And then always check all the fields to update.
[18:23:26] <ernston> oh god
[18:23:27] <Whirl3d> Is there a slidestop method on your slider
[18:23:52] <ernston> i dont think so
[18:24:03] <ernston> am not very good at this
[18:26:13] <Krambiorix> UraniumSteel, so i have to get all the "numbers" out of all my divs, store them in an array and then?
[18:26:45] <UraniumSteel> then use the javascript sort function on your array with that function code I provided
[18:27:05] <UraniumSteel> then once you have the values sorted then you have to go back and move the actual divs in your DOM
[18:28:33] <UraniumSteel> However you might find this really useful instead: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10186192/javascript-sort-of-html-elements
[18:28:48] <UraniumSteel> Depends on the structure of your HTML/DOM
[18:31:55] <UraniumSteel> Your comparison function should be the one I gave you earlier instead of the one in the example on that page, other than that if you have no other elements betweens your DIV's then you should be okay
[18:33:17] <ernston> no joy
[18:34:14] <doug65536> Krambiorix: sort stuff like this: http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/9jRbR/41/
[18:35:11] <ernston> still unsure how to solve this
[18:35:19] <p3lim> I want to modify the search pattern of the autocomplete input element from html5, here is a demo: http://jsfiddle.net/42nSd/
[18:35:38] <p3lim> I want it to suggest both "one" and "two" when I hit "o", basically match any character, not just the first one
[18:37:59] <Whirl3d> ernston, I am working on it. You'll have to clean it up, but I can get the structure laid out. Gimme a couple minutes
[18:39:06] <ernston> no rush at all
[18:39:10] <ernston> thanxfor the help
[18:39:21] <ernston> am making more errors
[18:40:09] <ernston> i best undo
[18:46:27] <doug65536> Krambiorix: I'll help you adapt it for your specific scenario if you like
[18:50:42] <doug65536> p3lim: I'm not aware of any events that you can catch for autocomplete.
[18:50:58] <doug65536> p3lim: I suppose you could dynamically modify the list child elements
[18:51:24] <p3lim> I can use onkeypress to catch it, but I don't know how I will parse it to the autocomplete to have it react to it
[18:52:27] <HardDisk_WP> Hey
[18:52:45] <HardDisk_WP> Can Idetermine the pixel height of the scroll-difference when a user turns mousewheel once?
[18:52:59] <p3lim> I know I can do it really hacky, but first I have to inspect the popup that appears, not easy :p
[18:53:11] <doug65536> p3lim: can you?
[18:53:28] <doug65536> I'd be surprised if it were possible
[18:53:44] <p3lim> I can access all the options in js, so I just parse through them
[18:53:56] <p3lim> But I need to know how to manipulate the autocomplete dropdown/popup
[18:54:35] <doug65536> I'm looking at the w3c specs right now and I see no API or events or any way to influence it other than enabling or disabling the autocomplete
[18:54:49] <p3lim> w3c sucks
[18:55:07] <doug65536> what? the standards body sucks?
[18:55:20] <doug65536> yeah the www consortium sucks :|
[18:56:04] <doug65536> you know, the official www standards documents
[18:56:23] <doug65536> not w3schools lol
[18:56:41] <p3lim> I meant w3schools
[18:56:48] <doug65536> ok :)
[18:59:29] <doug65536> p3lim: if you really want that much control over the autocomplete, my suggestion is doing it yourself
[18:59:58] <Whirl3d> ernston, this is really easy. But I have to fix it. I am not sure which elements are name what, but I am almost done
[19:00:02] <sifu_> how would i get the number of <th> inside a selected row http://jsfiddle.net/vyM93/1/
[19:00:05] <p3lim> Currently using jquery-ui's autocomplete method, but I want to test and see if I can replicate it with just html5
[19:01:36] <doug65536> p3lim: http://www.w3.org/Submission/web-forms2/#the-autocomplete
[19:02:03] <p3lim> Yeah I know of the autocomplete attribute
[19:02:12] <p3lim> I'm not talking about the attributes though
[19:02:45] <p3lim> I am using a predefined list, as shown in my fiddle
[19:03:05] <doug65536> p3lim: also see section 2.11
[19:03:14] <doug65536> p3lim: it seems very limited in html5
[19:03:24] <doug65536> sorry, 2.12
[19:04:22] <doug65536> p3lim: so doing it partially manually, by dynamically modifying the content of the datalist seems the only html5 way
[19:05:21] <ernston> sorry i was miles away
[19:05:38] <ernston> can i help some how?
[19:06:03] <ernston> the search input is searching text within
[19:06:20] <doug65536> sifu_: index()
[19:06:21] <ernston> the services/checkbox's and slider search for a class name
[19:06:36] <sifu_> doug65536 hmm will have a look thanks
[19:06:56] <doug65536> sifu_: probably something like container.children().index(the_thing)
[19:07:22] <doug65536> sifu_: or the_thing.parent().children().index(the_thing)
[19:07:36] <sifu_> hmm…that kinda confused me more ;p…just tang baby steps in jQuery…found out how with javscript
[19:07:39] <p3lim> doug65536: Yeah, just gotta get a look at how the autocomplete box works
[19:07:41] <sifu_> javascript*
[19:07:49] <p3lim> But every time it loses focus it disappears :p
[19:07:53] <doug65536> p3lim: where? firefox source code?
[19:07:54] <p3lim> So I can't inspect it properly
[19:08:05] <p3lim> Using chrome
[19:08:06] <doug65536> p3lim: it isn't a part of the dom
[19:08:16] <p3lim> What is it then?
[19:08:26] <doug65536> p3lim: browser
[19:08:26] <p3lim> Just rendered out of thin air? :p
[19:08:28] <sifu_> alert(document.getElementById('compareMPG').rows[0].cells.length)
[19:08:34] <sifu_> that works in JS
[19:08:50] <doug65536> p3lim: where is the code that draws elements?
[19:09:08] <p3lim> The autocomplete box?
[19:09:21] <p3lim> There is no code for it, html5 does it by itself
[19:09:31] <ernston> Whirl3d is there anything i need to explain ?
[19:09:32] <doug65536> p3lim: I would be impressed if you could capture a user picking something from autocomplete without polling with setTimeout
[19:09:36] <p3lim> The fiddle I linked is everything
[19:09:59] <p3lim> onselect or something would work fine for that
[19:10:11] <p3lim> If only I could see how the box works :/
[19:10:25] <doug65536> p3lim: I keep trying to tell you, it is a part of the browser
[19:10:39] <doug65536> p3lim: why don't you see how text is drawn while you're at it :D
[19:11:28] <doug65536> where is the code that drops down a <select>. it's nowhere. it is built into the browser
[19:12:07] <doug65536> p3lim: good lick
[19:12:10] <doug65536> luck*
[19:12:21] <tw2113> magical voodoohoodoo
[19:12:22] <p3lim> Yeah..
[19:13:27] <Whirl3d> GAWD jsfiddle sucks now.
[19:13:45] <doug65536> Whirl3d: why do you say that?
[19:13:46] <tw2113> jsbin is where it's at
[19:14:11] <Whirl3d> every two to five seconds, my entire browser locks up for a good 2 seconds
[19:14:12] <p3lim> Gotta keep using jquery-ui's autocomplete for now then
[19:14:17] <Whirl3d> makes typing anything impossible
[19:14:18] <ernston> you have no idea how much trouble i  have with jsfiddle
[19:14:24] <p3lim> Which reminds me, is it possible to force it to stay open?
[19:14:34] <ernston> i need help just getting what works offline to work in jsfiddle
[19:14:51] <doug65536> Whirl3d: text selection only has issues in firefox
[19:15:29] <doug65536> Whirl3d: but ya, that selection bug sucks
[19:15:44] <doug65536> Whirl3d: never happens in chrome though
[19:16:52] <doug65536> p3lim: you can turn it on, turn it off, and specify a list of things that it completes from. that's about it from the standards documents I looked through
[19:18:00] <doug65536> p3lim: 3/4 of the standards text goes on and on about legacy browser fallback
[19:18:57] <doug65536> ernston: show the fiddle?
[19:19:21] <ernston> Whirl3d is currently working on it
[19:19:26] <ernston> my last post was
[19:19:30] <ernston> http://jsfiddle.net/TnDha/52/
[19:19:37] <ernston> am not sure where Whirl3d is upto though
[19:19:40] <Krambiorix> doug65536, sorry i had a phone call
[19:19:50] <Krambiorix> it's pretty late now, i'll go to sleep and look at it tomorrow
[19:19:55] <ernston> you wont believe the issues ive had with google maps + jsfiddle
[19:19:58] <Krambiorix> doug65536, thanks a lot for your time/help
[19:20:04] <doug65536> Krambiorix: np
[19:20:12] <ernston> i feel a map is essential for a web app
[19:20:24] <ernston> for a shop finder tool
[19:20:41] <ernston> considering drawing a map in paintshop instead and using an image
[19:24:15] <p3lim> doug65536: $('#search').autocomplete('search') works well to show it atleast
[19:24:26] <Whirl3d> ernston, Here's the deal:   add a class to each listing element called ".rating"+n (where n  is a number 0-4)
[19:24:41] <doug65536> p3lim: yeah, keep using jquery, at least it is cross-browser and works on crappy browsers
[19:24:50] <Whirl3d> then add classes to the list items that match your service values  ".spacecake"
[19:25:08] <doug65536> p3lim: the html5 autocomplete is a joke in comparison
[19:25:15] <ernston> is this from  http://jsfiddle.net/TnDha/52/
[19:25:24] <p3lim> True, but I wanted to see if it was possible :)
[19:25:41] <ernston> am not sure if we are looking at the same version
[19:28:00] <Whirl3d> ernston, don't make any changes for just a second. Just listen
[19:28:25] <ernston> oky
[19:28:38] <ernston> am unsure what to touch so am being very cautious
[19:29:00] <ernston> already had to resort to backup file, completely messed my offline file
[19:35:32] <Whirl3d> ernston, here is where we need to start. Notice I commented out 3 sections...we'll fix those next
[19:35:43] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/TnDha/68/
[19:37:57] <ernston> oky let me checkl
[19:39:14] <ernston> am ready
[19:41:51] <Whirl3d> okay, now I created the updateList function and set the handlers up...http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/TnDha/69/
[19:42:47] <ernston> am looking at this and trying to follow what is going on
[19:43:05] <ernston> storing selectors in variables ?
[19:43:31] <Whirl3d> $("#rating_field") selects the element whose ID is rating_field
[19:43:49] <ernston> and on change of 3 of the selectors the updateList function is ran
[19:44:31] <Whirl3d> yes. Whenever any of your input elements change, update list
[19:45:01] <Whirl3d> next, we will go through all of the input elements and determine what to keep and what to lose
[19:45:14] <ernston> what line?
[19:50:57] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/TnDha/71/
[19:51:17] <Whirl3d> start at line 37
[19:51:23] <Whirl3d> I added comments for every line
[19:51:31] <ernston> jesus
[19:51:35] <ernston> you said this was easy
[19:51:50] <Whirl3d> the comments make it look big
[19:52:12] <ernston> i thought the comments where, what i had to add
[19:52:19] <ernston> began to scare me
[19:59:27] <Whirl3d> It keeps missing letters as I type. So Frustrating
[20:01:16] <ernston> is it the whole browser or just that window?
[20:01:30] <ernston> i find it easier edit in a code editor and paste to jsfiddle
[20:01:37] <ernston> well i dont find code easy
[20:04:13] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/TnDha/79/
[20:04:17] <Whirl3d> This is close
[20:04:31] <Gmac_> i have a plugin in wordpress says that curCss is undefined. its because I'm using the newest version of jquery
[20:04:37] <Whirl3d> make sure you hvae the developers console open so you can see the console.log
[20:04:46] <Gmac_> and the jquery ui file is old
[20:04:56] <Gmac_> can i just replace it or will it break more stuff
[20:06:15] <ernston> the ratings work
[20:06:16] <ernston> :D
[20:06:30] <ernston> i just realise there are radio button's not checkbox's
[20:06:37] <ernston> so that multiple can be selected
[20:06:42] <ernston> from services
[20:08:46] <Whirl3d> or deselected
[20:09:57] <ernston> sorry its late am slowing down
[20:10:15] <ernston> thanx for your help i really appreciate it
[20:10:30] <ernston> pass to the left \o
[20:16:04] <Whirl3d> tell me in english what the text field is for
[20:16:56] <ernston> #searchField ?
[20:17:29] <ernston> to filter the list of items
[20:17:48] <ernston> :s
[20:17:52] <ernston> this a trick?
[20:21:23] <ernston> eg: entering 'abr'  will show only shops that have that content, the title or the address, as it scans the <li> for text
[20:21:38] <diegoviola> hi
[20:21:50] <ernston> hey
[20:22:38] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/TnDha/89/
[20:23:08] <Whirl3d> ernston, Ithis has got to be close. I have to run for a bit. If it's not completely right, at least the logic is there for you
[20:23:21] <ernston> thanx
[20:23:26] <ernston> its after 4am here
[20:23:34] <ernston> i will save this and be back tomorrow :)
[20:23:39] <ernston> thanx so much for the help
[20:23:45] <Whirl3d> Check it out first. I think it's right
[20:23:58] <ernston> its close
[20:24:00] <Hi_Everyone> Hi!
[20:24:15] <ernston> i found some problems
[20:24:30] <ernston> sort it later
[20:24:35] <ernston> i must sleep too
[20:25:45] <diegoviola> any plugins for drag-and-drop uploads that you guys can recommend? i'm working on a "bulk uploader", my server side code is ruby, and i'm using the dropbox api for sending the files to dropbox, but i'm wondering how to do the client-side part
[20:26:16] <Hi_Everyone> hey, I'm really new to this programming thing and I'm making a game. I want users to be able to save but I don't have what it takes to save severside(too hard) so I was hoping I could save variables to a local file and open and read that local file when loading the game. Problem is, there are no tutorails for doing this with javascript or jquery. is it possible?
[20:29:57] <pixelpimp> look up localstorage
[20:31:35] <Hi_Everyone> thank you pixelpimp
[20:32:38] <p3lim> There we go, fixed the bugs and finished up the autocomplete box: http://paste.p3lim.net/
[20:33:35] <p3lim> And ofcourse I spoke too early
[21:31:47] <PhlowHome> Anyone know how I can make a div inside of a sortable not trigger dragging?
[21:57:12] <Expedion> Hi
[21:57:25] <Expedion> I got a little problem here on my side with using a slider in a tab...
[21:57:53] <Expedion> http://playgames.maximuspresents.com/windows-games/ the top slider is the way the slider should function, and beneath is my trying to put the slider in the tabs. (Arrows of the slider dissapear when the slider is placed in the tab)
[21:57:59] <Expedion> Any idea what could be causing the issue?
[21:58:11] <Expedion> Been breaking my head for days now on this issue :/
[22:01:10] <Snerf> your arrows are white.. that doesnt help
[22:08:23] <Expedion> Hey Snerf
[22:09:02] <Expedion> Doesn't matter.... black or white lol. Yeah I can change them for ya if you like but the thing should still slide if I'd press in that area.
[22:09:19] <Expedion> You could even do a mouse swipe for all I care :)
[22:09:38] <Snerf> what do you want it to do exactly?
[22:10:15] <Expedion> Wait let me just enable the arrow keys to be always displayed
[22:10:32] <Expedion> Basically that slider on top you see? That's the way the slider should be functioning in the tabs...
[22:10:42] <Snerf> you want the slider inside a tab?
[22:10:57] <Snerf> or the tabs to slide?
[22:11:04] <Expedion> Slider inside a tab :)
[22:11:12] <Expedion> Auto hiding of arrows has now been disabled...
[22:11:22] <Expedion> Take a look, try to slide, it creates an overlapping effect :/
[22:11:49] <Snerf> it just moves it a little to the left
[22:12:19] <Expedion> lol sec man
[22:12:21] <Expedion> let me share my screen
[22:12:27] <Snerf> or the right.. when I click on em
[22:12:47] <Expedion> https://join.me/770-405-682
[22:13:11] <Snerf> you have totally diferent sliders
[22:13:19] <Expedion> Jesus dude
[22:13:29] <Expedion> Just join that link i sent ya to see my screen
[22:13:34] <Hi_Everyone> change event doesn't fire if file has same name. is there anyway around that?
[22:13:48] <Snerf> ok.. if your gonna be a dick about me helping you out.. this is done
[22:14:06] <Expedion> No I'm not a dick, you should just join my screen instead because you're getting off track...
[22:14:19] <Expedion> I don't want to de-rail like any further or else we both might end up talking through eachother :D
[22:14:19] <Snerf> yes, you are.. lighten up.. I am asking you some questions
[22:14:27] <Expedion> It's the same slider...
[22:14:31] <Snerf> no its not
[22:14:37] <Expedion> Why not?
[22:14:38] <Snerf> totally different classes
[22:14:45] <Expedion> Totally different classes?
[22:14:48] <Expedion> What class do you think it is then
[22:15:02] <Expedion> That's funny that you think that, now I'm interested why you say that
[22:15:41] <Snerf> cuz its as clear as day, dude
[22:16:05] <Expedion> Which classes are you seeing as being different..
[22:16:06] <Expedion> Post em up
[22:16:17] <Snerf> nm.. just need to dig deeper
[22:16:25] <Expedion> Nah dude, it is the same class trust me
[22:16:50] <Snerf> ya, nm
[22:17:10] <Snerf> you know you have an error in your royalslider.min.js ?
[22:17:16] <Expedion> Nice, where?
[22:17:19] <Expedion> Didn't know that!
[22:17:37] <Snerf> what browser ya use?
[22:17:41] <Expedion> Chrome.
[22:17:48] <Snerf> look at the console
[22:17:52] <Expedion> Ok sec
[22:18:03] <Snerf> you mean you dont look at it normally?
[22:18:08] <Expedion> Yes I do...
[22:18:16] <Snerf> doesnt look like it :)
[22:18:23] <Snerf> or you would have seen the error
[22:18:23] <Expedion> I just don't look at the area you were looking at for errors
[22:18:36] <Snerf> you should
[22:18:46] <Snerf> save yourself some grief :)
[22:18:51] <Snerf> Uncaught TypeError: Object #<t> has no method 'x'
[22:19:08] <Expedion> Doesn't display any error here...
[22:19:37] <Expedion> YES
[22:19:38] <Expedion> I see it
[22:19:41] <Expedion> Hold on let me see :/
[22:20:15] <Expedion> You know I'm not really a programmer or anything like that, I'm just trying to make the best of what I can do and sort of develop my way through as I learn things.
[22:20:19] <Expedion> So don't be that harsh on me ;)
[22:20:41] <Snerf> lol.. then doint be a dick
[22:20:59] <Snerf> if you want to be pushy, prepare for ppl to walk away
[22:21:15] <Expedion> Nah, I just got irritated at the fact at how you couldnt see they are 2 different classes.
[22:21:24] <Expedion> But then again, I've been breaking my head now for DAYS over this issue... so it piles up
[22:21:33] <Expedion> They are the same class*
[22:21:37] <Expedion> See making mistakes already lol.
[22:21:56] <Expedion> Alright let me take a look at that javascript for a sec here
[22:21:57] <Snerf> ya, settle down a bit :) I just needed to dig deeper
[22:22:11] <Expedion> :)
[22:22:30] <Snerf> regardless... that error came up.. somewhere, not sure how :)
[22:23:22] <Expedion> I doubt this is the problem though...
[22:23:34] <Expedion> Because I even tried using other different sliders, in some what way it just messes up the sliders when I put them in a tab
[22:23:39] <Expedion> But I'll look into it
[22:23:41] <Snerf> well, no idea then
[22:23:56] <Snerf> maybe its just not meant to run inside a tab
[22:24:13] <Expedion> Myeah I don't know.... :(
[22:24:17] <Expedion> I really want it to run inside a tab though
[22:24:22] <Snerf> why ?
[22:24:23] <Expedion> Or something that i could use as an alternative...
[22:24:33] <Snerf> looks better the other way
[22:24:43] <Expedion> Because I don't want people to click on a button that says "next page" and constantly have the page refresh again
[22:24:47] <Expedion> It needs to be smooth...
[22:25:06] <Expedion> Lol, you're looking at the styling of the tab atm... which will be totally changed to fit the style of the site ;)
[22:25:08] <Snerf> its not refreshing
[22:25:16] <Snerf> the top slider works fine..
[22:25:27] <Expedion> Yeah but the purpose of the tab is to have different game  genres...
[22:25:33] <Snerf> ya, and?
[22:25:43] <Expedion> So I'd have. A genre for racing, shooter, for each tab
[22:25:52] <Expedion> So every tab is a genre.
[22:26:42] <Snerf> ya, I understand. I wouldnt do it like that. looks kind og "ugly" if ya know what I mean
[22:26:53] <Expedion> Nah, it won't...
[22:27:04] <Snerf> i'd made the 1st slider the genres.. and then when they select it, it shows a new slider the games for that genre
[22:27:05] <Expedion> It'll actually look really nice once i stylize the tab properly
[22:27:48] <Expedion> Hmmmm I get your idea, but that would kind of be a little tooo, well, I basically want people to be confronted with the games immediately without going through genres and all that..
[22:28:05] <Expedion> After all, the games they download, I get a lead for. So the purpose is to persuade them as much as possible.
[22:28:07] <Snerf> they have the click the tabs anyways
[22:28:38] <Snerf> do it the way ya want.. I just wouldnt.. i'd show genres 1st.. and then load the games
[22:28:39] <Expedion> Yeah but when they are on the page for windows games, they are already confronted with an open tab taht has bunch of games on em.
[22:29:08] <Expedion> And then they end up going to the genre window... and when they want a diferent genre, they click on back?
[22:29:10] <Expedion> lol
[22:29:15] <Snerf> ya
[22:29:23] <Snerf> or a home button at the top
[22:29:30] <Expedion> That'll look like a 60 year old designed it all
[22:29:41] <Expedion> No offense, but that's not conversion friendly at all
[22:29:41] <Snerf> your choice..
[22:29:47] <Snerf> I think it is
[22:29:55] <Snerf> I think thats the better way to do it
[22:29:55] <Expedion> Why would it be conversion friendly?
[22:30:15] <Snerf> most ppl on our site will only choose windows games, cuz thats all they see
[22:30:25] <Expedion> Hmmm Snerf, whats your site?
[22:30:26] <Snerf> most wont even go to different tabs
[22:30:32] <Snerf> my site?
[22:30:37] <Expedion> You say, on our site?
[22:30:47] <Snerf> i mean YOUR site.. typo :)
[22:30:50] <Expedion> oh haha.
[22:30:58] <Snerf> my kb sucks
[22:31:06] <Expedion> Nah they won't choose only Windows games mate. I'll target all sorts of people from mobile users to desktop users.
[22:31:07] <Snerf> kids play on it too much, has fgood in the keys. lol
[22:31:12] <Expedion> :D
[22:31:21] <Snerf> why so ?  why would they select different tabs
[22:31:32] <Expedion> For a different genre.
[22:31:33] <Snerf> when all they see is games already
[22:31:37] <Expedion> lol.
[22:31:44] <Snerf> you would be surprised how many wont
[22:32:01] <Snerf> they come to load a game.. see em.. and there ya go..
[22:32:02] <Expedion> People often times search for games in a certain genre mate... I don't want it to be 1 chaotic mess of all sorts of genres
[22:32:15] <Expedion> Google store does it, apple store does it.
[22:32:18] <Expedion> They do all of that for a reason.
[22:32:30] <Snerf> do you do a lot of analytics and such, see how ppl tranverse through websites?
[22:32:54] <Snerf> ya, and they KNOW that the ones on the 1st page is what is loaded most.. theya rent stupid
[22:33:19] <Expedion> Snerf....
[22:33:36] <Snerf> anyways.. no matter.. I dont know how to solve your problem, sorry
[22:33:44] <Expedion> The first tab they see will be "Popular" the other tabs will be: All, Action, Mmorpg and so on
[22:33:55] <Expedion> I dont think you understand the gaming niche that well lol
[22:33:55] <Expedion> :D
[22:33:58] <Expedion> But it's ok
[22:34:04] <Expedion> Yeah this sucks.... the issue is annoying as hell
[22:34:15] <Snerf> no need to throw out insults buddy
[22:34:22] <Expedion>  No body is throwing insults
[22:34:23] <Snerf> it has nothing to do with "gaming"
[22:34:32] <Expedion> What i said had nothing to do with insults...
[22:34:33] <Expedion> lol
[22:34:38] <Snerf> it hs to do with how ppl perceive what they see
[22:34:45] * Snerf is done
[22:34:50] <Expedion> And yes it has all to do with gaming.
[22:34:53] <Expedion> You think too black and white.
[22:35:26] <Snerf> w/ dude.. sorry I couldnt help you out with your problem
[22:35:40] <Expedion> Nah it's fine, thanks for the, effort
[22:36:09] <Snerf> and if you want to piss of programmers with your bad attitude, dont expect any, help
[22:37:35] <Expedion> Lol, I think it has more to do with how "you perceive" then what attitude i give you right now.
[22:38:14] <Expedion> But when a person gives feedback like: it just moves a little to the left and right....
[22:38:29] <Expedion> I just don't know man, I facepalmed myself 10x already over that
[23:12:09] <Whirl3d> what is the best way to detect if someone is dragging? I am trying to allow people to drag the screen like you would a touch device by clicking anywhere and dragging to scroll...any suggestions?
[23:24:51] <Whirl3d> why is it that when I store a function in the data attribute of a jquery object, when I retrieve it, it's not a function
[23:27:09] <Whirl3d> nvm lol
[23:27:17] <onenine90> is it possible to pass dat aback and forth from two windows on the same domain
[23:27:25] <onenine90> data
[23:27:55] <Whirl3d> don't think so. BUt maybe through cookies? Really not sure
[23:28:07] <onenine90> ok thx
