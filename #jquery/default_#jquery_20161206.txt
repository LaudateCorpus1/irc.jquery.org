[00:15:07] <GeekMonkey> solice it is not broken
[00:15:15] <GeekMonkey> it is loading the data differently
[00:15:25] <GeekMonkey> but doesn't have the collapse feature
[00:16:29] <solice> GeekMonkey fair enough i didn't download it or try to set it up was just from looking at the demo
[00:29:24] <ismithers> Is there an event triggered after document.ready? Like right after, like a document.lateReady or something.
[01:26:48] <Cork> ismithers: ready isn't an event it is a jquery callback, and no there isn't an after
[01:27:05] <Cork> ismithers: you could try using the onload event
[02:13:39] <anli> Is it only me or did google chrome change startup background color?
[03:27:36] <ismithers> Thanks Cork, yeah I mispoke when I said event. I was just looking for something that can trigger things directly after document ready is run. Think I have something workable though.
[03:38:19] <Cork> ismithers: simplest might be to provide you're own $.Callbacks() callback
[03:38:38] <Cork> and fire it your self and then you can run that in an ready callback
[03:38:43] <Cork> and do your things after
[03:40:03] <ismithers> Yar
[03:40:07] <ismithers> In the fullness of time :)
[03:41:29] <OnceMe> Hello, how can I make an animation that goes from center of underline and it goes equally to the left and right and ends that on hover? Here is my example: https://jsfiddle.net/ru35g3Lb/
[03:45:28] <Cork> OnceMe: give me a bit
[03:45:55] <OnceMe> I just cant think about spreading from center to the left and right
[03:46:05] <OnceMe> google forms have something similar for their input box
[03:49:43] <Cork> OnceMe: https://jsfiddle.net/ru35g3Lb/2/
[03:50:03] <OnceMe> you did it without jquery? :O
[03:50:10] <Cork> css3 transition
[03:50:39] <OnceMe> Google uses that too?
[03:50:50] <Cork> what?
[03:51:08] <Cork> what does google have to do with this?
[03:51:46] <Cork> anyway, you can do the animation with jquery animate too
[03:52:11] <Cork> the problem with that is: 1. it won't be as smooth, cause it isn't gpu accelerated
[03:52:58] <Cork> 2. it will be susceptible to dom delays, as it will have to modify it for each iteration
[03:53:32] <Cork> but ya, it would have better backwards compatibility; though i don't think it is a big deal, none compatible browsers would just get the purble line directly, without the animation
[03:57:18] <OnceMe> ah, ok thanks for input :)
[03:57:32] <Cork> np
[04:19:06] <jax> hello
[04:19:30] <jax> i'm trying to replace all numbers in a table (need to fake a table with random numbers). any easy way to do this?
[04:20:36] <jax> or is there an easy way to replace every digit with another digit?
[04:21:29] <Cork> jax: dom doesn't provide a way to do large amount of text modifications
[04:21:55] <Cork> and it is quite tricky to modify test without messing up other elements
[04:22:29] <jax> hm ok
[04:22:33] <jax> i think i will try something like this
[04:22:42] <Cork> if you don't have anything of "value" connected to the table (aka plugins or event handlers
[04:22:50] <Cork> the simplest solution is to serialize the table to html
[04:22:55] <jax> no its pretty plain. might be able to do something like: $('#table').html().replace(/[0-9]/g,"X"))
[04:23:07] <Cork> regex search and replace the text and replace the table with a new one from the new html source
[04:23:28] <Cork> jax: ya, except you have to do $('#table').html(result)
[04:23:47] <Cork> and note the table content will be replaced so any dom references used into it will be gone
[04:24:50] <jax> i just need it to fake a screenshot
[04:25:08] <jax> can't use the clients numbers ;)
[04:29:57] <jax> perfect, thanks
[04:30:08] <jax> $('#data-table').html($('#data-table').html().replace(/[0-9]/g,Math.floor(Math.random() * 9) + 1));
[04:30:20] <jax> any way to let that random flow in? of course it only uses the random number once...
[05:44:30] <`ULT> Hello, is there a better way to writing something like this?  $("#button-cart-multiple2").popover({title: "Header", content: "Text in popover body"}).popover('show');
[05:44:52] <`ULT> combining some bootstrap options with method
[05:49:45] <WhirledPress> given an href attribute of #test how do I select all <a> elements with href='#test' right now I get the entire url+#test as the href prop
[05:53:07] <WhirledPress> sorry, figured it out $("a[href$='#test']");
[05:53:21] <Cork> WhirledPress: you don't need $
[05:53:36] <Cork> jsut $("a[href='#test']"); will do
[05:54:03] <decx> get all anchors in your target container and filter
[06:01:51] <`ULT> Hi, I dont know exactely how I can combine options with a method (bootstrap)
[06:02:08] <`ULT> Is this the correct way?    $("#button-cart-multiple2").popover({title: "Header", content: "Text in popover body"}).popover('show');
[06:03:24] <WhirledPress> Cork, when I tried it without href$=   it wasn't matching.
[06:03:41] <Cork> WhirledPress: do you have urls in the href too?
[06:04:01] <WhirledPress> Not in the source, but somehow they get added
[06:04:06] <Cork> meaning href is href="someting/something#test"?
[06:04:11] <WhirledPress> nope
[06:04:18] <WhirledPress> just href="#test"
[06:04:31] <Cork> hmm then href="#test" should work just fine
[06:05:36] <Cork> WhirledPress: https://jsfiddle.net/37Lh13te/
[06:08:52] <WhirledPress> very odd. It wasn't working before. I guess I had a typo in my target string. Thanks for the help.
[06:13:27] <WhirledPress> if ( want to select the section header element whose position().top is closest to 0, would I use filter or map or is there a better way?
[06:29:15] <kryl> hi
[06:29:16] <kryl> hi, is there a way to verify with javascript a form and return true or false if all fields are valided ?
[06:39:32] <WhirledPress> kryl, there are lots of ways to do that, but that's a complicated question that would be best answered by Google, I'm afraid.
[06:40:24] <WhirledPress> There are lots of javascript validation libraries for forms, so it all depends on your needs
[06:41:04] <kryl> light & just return if the (html5 required options) are true or false
[06:41:11] <kryl> for all the form
[06:41:22] <kryl> I mean for one unique form
[06:42:02] <WhirledPress> if you wanted to setup a jsfiddle test case, I could check it out. But without the html source, I'm afraid it's not going to be easy to help
[06:44:18] <kryl> alert($('#cmd-divider')[0].checkValidity()); testing this one
[06:44:38] <kryl> I'll do the jsfiddle but it's not possible to just copy / paste the actual code
[06:52:27] <WhirledPress> checkValidity is not a default jquery method that I know of. Perhaps you are using a plugin?
[06:53:40] <kryl> it's working in built-in
[06:53:48] <kryl> but if you can have a look here : http://plnkr.co/edit/RifUli3hDIq6kQJI0Ujc?p=preview
[06:55:15] <kryl> the problem is about PP button, I want to validate before to launch his action. But here it's binded to the click function and I can't add logicals inside the button without breaking it actually. Maybe I'll have to create an other button do my validation and call the hided button after or as a trigger.
[06:55:21] <kryl> looks complicate ...
[06:56:28] <WhirledPress> looks like you might be able to use:  var istrue=$("form input:valid").length==$("form input").length;
[06:57:51] <WhirledPress> that would count the input fields with the valid pseudo-attribute selected and compare to all input fields. If they were the same count, it would be true.
[07:00:09] <WhirledPress> wait. Are you just trying to make sure the form is valid before enabling the submit button?
[07:00:33] <kryl> WhirledPress, here we are : http://plnkr.co/edit/hXsS1Xm82vQE9ZIuMJLm?p=preview
[07:00:45] <kryl> how to validate before to launch the pp popup
[07:03:27] <WhirledPress> disable the button first
[07:03:40] <WhirledPress> then on any input change, validate your form
[07:03:52] <WhirledPress> if the form is valid, enable the button. If not, keep it disabled
[07:04:11] <kryl> ok
[07:05:19] <kryl> creation of this button is dynamic, but I'll turn around
[07:05:37] <WhirledPress> when is the button created?
[07:09:47] <kryl> the functions are in checkout.js and it's called for async method in window.paypalCheckoutReady = function() { I think here it will populate the button inside a container look here I updated the code : http://plnkr.co/edit/hXsS1Xm82vQE9ZIuMJLm?p=preview
[07:17:59] <WhirledPress> so set your click handler to the container for the button that you pass the id to in the setup.
[07:18:18] <Cork> kryl: there are built in form validation in the browsers, you could look at using that
[07:18:40] <WhirledPress> Cork is the genius here--listen to him.
[07:19:01] <Cork> kryl: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Forms/Data_form_validation
[07:19:25] <Cork> if you want the minimal amount of dependencies
[07:19:32] <kryl> hum
[07:19:43] <Cork> jquery form validator is a fairly common choice too
[07:23:28] <hellyeah> jquery doÄ±esnt have any problem with canvas right?
[07:24:11] <Cork> hellyeah: why would it?
[07:24:39] <hellyeah> hmm i read jquery is not doing good with svg
[07:32:38] <kryl> WhirledPress, this one is working : http://plnkr.co/edit/wOEVdFO6FvKAdXfitIpd?p=preview
[07:34:32] <snfgf>   $('#my_list').append('<li>One</li>').append('<li>Two</li>');
[07:34:43] <snfgf> doesn't work^
[07:35:12] <snfgf> help
[07:36:45] <shoky> snfgf: works  https://jsfiddle.net/3cjs5hx7/14/
[07:37:00] <snfgf> creepy
[07:42:30] <hellyeah> what is "creepy"
[07:42:45] <hellyeah> hmm
[07:42:57] <hellyeah> why he didnt create element one by one and append it to body
[07:43:07] <hellyeah> like $('li');
[07:43:26] <hellyeah> likevar $li =  $('li');
[07:43:41] <hellyeah> $lik.appendTo('body');
[07:43:47] <hellyeah> hmm
[07:43:50] <shoky> because that does something different?
[07:44:25] <hellyeah> something different? or append it to #my_list
[07:44:57] <shoky> var $li = $('li');   that finds all <li> elements in the DOM
[07:45:04] <shoky> $li.appendTo('body')    that appends all those found <li>'s  to <body>
[07:45:16] <shoky> has nothing to do with what he's doing.
[07:45:33] <shoky> adding new <li>'s to an existing list
[07:46:41] <hellyeah> ops
[07:46:56] <hellyeah> var $li = $('<li>');
[07:47:07] <hellyeah> for creating li element
[07:47:18] <hellyeah> and append it to mylist sorry for typo i did above
[07:47:19] <shoky> if you want it to be in a variable, sure
[07:47:27] <shoky> what he did is fine too
[07:47:49] <hellyeah> yeah i know i just asked which one is better approach in your side
[07:47:55] <hellyeah> i am just learner
[07:48:24] <shoky> they are both fine.  if you want to have the <li> in a variable so you can do more things with it, then you'll want to have it as var $li ..
[07:48:24] <shoky> if not, then not.
[07:48:26] <shoky> neither is better
[07:49:32] <shoky> and you didn't ask that.. you asked "why didnt he do this...", hinting that there is something wrong with what he did :)
[07:50:07] <hellyeah> :D
[07:50:58] <hellyeah> actually i though assigning element that you create to a variable can be better approach (in the sense of reusability)
[07:51:17] <shoky> like i said, if you need it in a variable, put it in a variable.
[08:14:05] <KevinDF> Hi, I'm getting a new monitor shortly but don't have enough slots in my graphics card as my TV is connected with hdmi and other slots are full. I wonder if connecting the tv to my motherboard HDMI would be fine instead of purchasing a hdmi splitter, or would that cause lagg?
[08:14:15] <KevinDF> Pretty much only watching netflix on the tv
[08:15:57] <`ULT> Hi, I dont know exactely how I can combine options with a method (bootstrap)
[08:16:09] <`ULT> Is this the correct way?    $("#button-cart-multiple2").popover({title: "Header", content: "Text in popover body"}).popover('show');
[08:17:11] <MikeD_> `ULT: that's called "chaining"
[08:18:18] <MikeD_> KevinDF: get a streaming device (Roku/Fire Stick/Chromecast/etc) for the TV and use wifi
[08:21:16] <`ULT> yes MikeD_
[08:21:23] <`ULT> but is this the correct way to achieve this=
[08:21:25] <`ULT> * ?
[08:21:42] <`ULT> Or can I combine the options and method in 1
[08:22:10] <MikeD_> that will depend on how the popover() method is designed
[08:22:19] <`ULT> something like ({title: "Header", content: "Text in popover body"},'show')
[08:23:00] <`ULT> $().popover(options)
[08:23:04] <`ULT> this is the method
[08:23:18] <`ULT> Like .popover('show')
[08:24:26] <`ULT> http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#popovers
[08:25:30] <MikeD_> it looks to me like they are not to be combined into a single statement
[08:25:58] <`ULT> No indeed, I tried some but it won`t work. So we need chaining for this?
[08:26:50] <MikeD_> well, you can use chaining in that case... or use two steps
[08:27:25] <MikeD_> var foo = $("#foo"); foo.popover( options ); foo.popover('show');
[08:28:05] <MikeD_> if you already specified the options when you constructed the dom element, you would probably only need to have the show method called in an event handler
[09:00:39] <`ULT> thank you MikeD_
[09:15:05] <Tennis> does anyone have a favourite drag n drop file upload, i'm spoilt by choice https://blueimp.github.io/jQuery-File-Upload/ this seems like my best option to be able to manually submit the form
[09:17:14] <shoky> Tennis: i've recently used dropzonejs, served me pretty good. and much simpler to use than blueimp's (at least from what i remember in the past)
[09:20:33] <Tennis> thanks shoky, I think when I was looking at that one it seems to auto upload
[09:20:57] <Tennis> do you know if you can have it upload on form submit?
[09:21:46] <Tennis> If you set autoProcessQueue to false, then .processQueue() is never called implicitly. This means that you have to call it yourself when you want to upload all files currently queued.
[09:21:51] <Tennis> cool that sounds like what i need
[09:22:20] <shoky> Tennis: yeap
[09:22:30] <shoky> haven't used that option myself
[09:58:17] <aliencat> hello guys
[09:58:45] <aliencat> I have some odd problem in mobile with scrollposition on mobile
[09:59:06] <aliencat> https://plnkr.co/edit/JQCQphugY76IqdsiFlsq
[09:59:47] <aliencat> for some reason the "dropdown" gets displaced when scrolling to the bottom
[09:59:52] <aliencat> in mobile
[10:09:20] <snfgf> guys
[10:10:08] <snfgf> when i, $('#my_select').append('<option value="1">value</option>');
[10:10:22] <snfgf> the option does not appear in the Select box
[10:10:26] <snfgf> it appears in the dropdown
[10:10:34] <MassDebates> aliencat: What do you mean 'dropdown gets displaced when scrolling to bottom'??
[10:10:52] <snfgf> but it isn't selected
[10:10:59] <aliencat> If I on the phone scrolls to bottom
[10:11:00] <MassDebates> snfgf:  That's your first option, not your placeholder.
[10:11:07] <snfgf> oooh
[10:11:24] <MassDebates> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/select check this out.
[10:11:31] <aliencat> and then click on the table row
[10:11:38] <MassDebates> note the "selected" attribute for one of the options to make it the 'placeholder'.
[10:11:45] <MassDebates> aliencat:  yes?
[10:12:08] <aliencat> the "drowdown" box wont appear at where I touch screen
[10:12:11] <MassDebates> aliencat:  So far you've pieced together "if I'm on the phone and I scroll to bottom and then I click on the table row"
[10:12:30] <MassDebates> aliencat:  the "dropdown" box won't appear at where I touch screen
[10:12:37] <MassDebates> okay, I will check this now. 2 moments.
[10:13:08] <aliencat> It works fine on desktop but not on an actual mobile device
[10:15:10] <MassDebates> Works on my android phone.
[10:15:22] <MassDebates> I don't have any of my test devices booted atm so I can't speak for the others, but it works on a verizon phone
[10:15:27] <MassDebates> How is it displaced, exactly?
[10:15:45] <aliencat> You tried scrolled all way down
[10:15:48] <aliencat> ?
[10:16:16] <MassDebates> snfgf:  Stop spamming. I answered your question.
[10:16:17] <snfgf> MassDebates, there is no placeholder property
[10:16:24] <MassDebates> Ohp sorry
[10:16:33] <MassDebates> that wasn't for snfgf that was to someone PMing me
[10:16:46] * snfgf continues spamming
[10:17:03] <MassDebates> snfgf:  I was talking about the 'selected' attribute.
[10:17:19] <MassDebates> Again, sorry about the typo there :P
[10:17:20] <snfgf> I've tried setting that but it doesn't seem to work
[10:17:23] <aliencat> The "drowdown" become placed very much below the touch position
[10:17:40] <MassDebates> aliencat:  Have you tried viewing it on a non-web IDE?
[10:17:49] <MassDebates> snfgf:  Codepen?
[10:18:19] <snfgf> MassDebates, the 'selected' attribute should be in one of the <options>, right?
[10:18:36] <aliencat> I believe setting val() on #my_select will change the selected element
[10:18:57] <aliencat> non-web IDE how do you mean?
[10:19:19] <MassDebates> snfgf:  http://codepen.io/anon/pen/yVjyBQ
[10:19:47] <MassDebates> aliencat:  What device are you testing on? Have you tried clicking the fullscreen preview button that plunkr provides?
[10:20:07] <MassDebates> it's possible that some of the other things on the page are interfering with the location for your tap and what gets rendered where.
[10:23:35] <aliencat> Just running the chrome on android
[10:25:15] <aliencat> Ah nevermind it works now for whatever reason
[10:26:32] <MassDebates> lol
[10:26:35] <MassDebates> I'm glad your issue was resolve.d.
[10:29:45] <aliencat> probably some kind of interferance
[10:30:20] <aliencat> my slightly more complicated example wont work trhough
[10:30:43] <aliencat> but there are so much that could have gone wrong
[10:31:24] <aliencat> it involves twitter bootstrap and all possible stuff :/
[10:35:50] <snfgf> quick question
[10:35:51] <snfgf> http://pastebin.com/3fFVBNJ9
[10:35:58] <MassDebates> quick link or quick question?
[10:36:10] <snfgf> quick link to quick question
[10:36:21] <MassDebates> Ah, variables
[10:36:27] <MassDebates> So, let's check out this code.
[10:36:32] <MassDebates> var select = $('#MySelect').removeAttr('disabled');
[10:36:44] <MassDebates> Quick answer? No. For your purposes, they're the same.
[10:36:50] <snfgf> Hmm
[10:36:50] <MassDebates> But that's not true in ALL cases.
[10:37:03] <MassDebates> Sometimes it can have a very big difference with larger functions! more propensity for error, harder to debug, etc.
[10:37:29] <shoky> huh, those are equivalent
[10:37:30] <snfgf> I thought removeAttr might return a status instead of the JQuery object its operating on
[10:37:35] <snfgf> ty
[10:37:42] <shoky> but you should be using .prop('disabled', false)
[10:37:50] <snfgf> hmm
[10:38:05] <snfgf> is disabled not also an attribute?
[10:38:25] <shoky> it is, but attributes are generally just whatever is on the initial html
[10:38:30] <shoky> not runtime properties of elements
[10:39:16] <MassDebates> shoky:  I'm just referring to coding practices.
[10:39:19] <shoky> stuff might work even if you do it with attributes instead of properties, but thats just jquery or the browser "helping" you out
[10:39:29] <MassDebates> shoky:  that's why I said for his purposes, they're the same.
[10:39:40] <MassDebates> OH! Goodness, I started with "No, they're the same" sorry
[10:39:45] <shoky> MassDebates oks. i'd say the quick answer is yes then, not no :)\
[10:40:02] <MassDebates> Yeah, that sentence contradicts itself lmao
[10:40:09] <MassDebates> Talk about mixed signals!
[10:40:13] <shoky> heh
[10:40:57] <MassDebates> snfgf:  The point of the longer answer is that you want to isolate and separate where appropriate. Ending statements before you chain too long is a good way to give yourself places to log for debugging errors and checking out what's
[10:41:04] <MassDebates> actually going on at a part of the script.
[10:41:14] <MassDebates> Here's an example:
[10:45:26] <MassDebates> snfgf:  https://jsfiddle.net/p79wqgxm/
[10:45:40] <MassDebates> This is a simple script that I used on a recent project for a machinery biz
[10:46:33] <MassDebates> We saw evidence of a high level of conversion rate being the result of having a full-width map of their office locations to contact. It's because their customers (largely in a business where face-to-face contact with vendors is critical to efficient operation)
[10:46:44] <MassDebates> needed to see how 'available' the business was.
[10:47:12] <snfgf> hmm
[10:47:14] <snfgf> ty
[10:47:20] <MassDebates> Now, when debugging this thing, like for example, the extra 'm' on mmap_canvas: A seemingly human issue, no? Surely you've made a tyop before, right?
[10:47:22] <MassDebates> See, I just made one right there!
[10:47:31] <MassDebates> Now, also note the successive usage of variables, as well.
[10:48:22] <MassDebates> These are things to consider when working with a more involved script for the UI of the map. Since hte map was full width (not with these points but ones that are further apart) the screen real-estate needed to be taken advantage of, so a full-width map was needed to show all of their office locations (i took a few out)
[10:49:13] <MassDebates> Since it was a full-width map with a contact form below, it made it very unfriendly to the UX to scroll down on the page -  when the cursor hovered over the map, it simply was zooming in! Not a fun time.
[10:49:29] <mazert> hello, when i create an ajax post request to update an entry in a database. is there a response convention to return, or this is completly arbitrary ?
[10:50:10] <MassDebates> So the solution was to 'activate' the map with a click directly on the element. This allowed the map to be 'zoomed in' whenever clicked, until the mouse stopped hovering on the element, making for a nice, almost completely intuitive, interaction :)
[10:50:24] <shoky> mazert: a 200 response with no body is fine
[10:51:00] <MassDebates> snfgf:  This was all made possible by delegation, separation, isolation, etc... - I've had to throw on a few logs at places here before I found the mmap_canvas typo myself!
[10:51:09] <MassDebates> It's because we're all human.
[10:51:09] <MassDebates> Get the gist?
[10:53:02] <mazert> shoky: ok that is what i thinked about, i've seen lot of different answers on so, blogs.. . thanks you
[11:17:18] <dglambert> yo
[11:17:56] <dglambert> hey does anyone see any glaring flaws with this script to track scring percentages in 25% increments
[11:17:57] <dglambert> https://gist.github.com/dglambert/1b42cc83ea4e7c686987c1fd19cd3ab8
[11:24:23] <decx> you're not gonna win any beauty pageants with it, but it'll do
[11:25:07] <dglambert> if I was trying to win beauty pageants, what would your suggestions be?
[11:25:55] <decx> throttle events, send scrolly into a separate function with a switch
[11:27:11] <decx> also probably better to have milestone elements that you use to really gouge how far a user scrollen instead of using strict percentages of the whole page
[11:27:33] <decx> has scrolled
[11:27:41] <decx> not has scrollen ^^
[11:27:47] <snfgf> strange error
[11:27:48] <snfgf> var widthId = $('#width').find(':selected').val();
[11:28:26] <snfgf> findTypeError: "#width".find is not a function[Learn More]
[11:28:35] <snfgf> O_o
[11:28:49] <dglambert> throttle events?
[11:28:53] <decx> console.log($('#width'))
[11:29:06] <decx> scroll events are very frequent
[11:29:13] <snfgf> got it thanks
[11:29:17] <decx> so you can run into performance problems on mobile
[11:29:22] <dglambert> yes, yes
[11:29:32] <dglambert> is there a way to check less frequently you think?
[11:29:42] <decx> throttle or debounce
[11:29:49] <decx> depending on application
[11:29:55] <dglambert> are thos keywords or concepts?
[11:30:03] <decx> both
[11:30:26] <dglambert> I'm just using Jquery, no other applications relevant
[11:30:38] <decx> application as in what does the scroll event do
[11:30:56] <dglambert> got it, I am pluging it in to Google Analytics
[11:31:08] <dglambert> that why I only really want the 25% increments
[11:31:14] <dglambert> anything else would be excessive
[11:31:40] <decx> so you push events
[11:31:44] <decx> site x scrolled to y
[11:32:08] <dglambert> site?
[11:32:20] <dglambert> not sure what you mean
[11:32:41] <dglambert> yes I am pushing event data to google analytics
[11:33:14] <dglambert> it doesn't have to be uber accurate, because I am not doing and ux related actions with it, its just for logging
[11:33:24] <dglambert> any ux**
[11:39:21] <mazert> shoky: by using a 200 httpresponse, I'm using success and error conditions, but only error is used while the ajax request was executed without problems.
[11:43:39] <mazert> or i can replace both by statuscode 200 and 400
[11:49:52] <mazert> my bad : i should return null or {} depending of the dataType setting.
[11:55:54] <robertmaxrees> weeee

[13:45:01] * hlve awkward laugh
[13:53:58] <dougquaid> I need to submit a form which makes an API call, and the API call returns JSON data. How can I do that in jquery?
[13:54:33] <`ULT> Hello, I have a button, and when qty == 0 a bootstrap popover is showing up. This is working correct. What I need is that when I click outside the button, the popover disappears
[13:54:56] <`ULT> You can see what I mean in this jsfiddle: https://jsfiddle.net/VUZhL/2588/
[13:55:27] <`ULT> I guess this is not possible with the default function data-trigger="focus"
[13:56:05] <`ULT> I need to achieve this with some other javascript/ jquery?
[13:56:17] <robertmaxrees> dougquaid using ajax
[13:57:04] <robertmaxrees> `ULT so you just want to dismiss the popover always?
[13:57:13] <`ULT> yes indeed robertmaxrees
[13:57:43] <`ULT> this is a default function in bootstrap, but only when I click first on #quantitybox instead of the button
[13:59:19] <robertmaxrees> i feel like those data attrs are what you want.
[13:59:49] <robertmaxrees> http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#dismiss-on-next-click
[13:59:54] <robertmaxrees> just need to properly configure it.
[14:00:02] <robertmaxrees> dougquaid that make sense?
[14:00:23] <`ULT> Yes I did robertmaxrees, but I dont think this is working.
[14:00:44] <robertmaxrees> `ULT it's not in your case because you haven't properly setup your HTML ;)
[14:02:11] <`ULT> what do you think what is not correct?
[14:02:58] <robertmaxrees> well.
[14:03:04] <robertmaxrees> looking at the markup differences.
[14:03:31] <`ULT> I put the popover on a <p> instead of a <a>
[14:03:38] <robertmaxrees> the p works.
[14:03:40] <robertmaxrees> the a doesn.t
[14:03:50] <[0xAA]> dougquaid: look, there's a .getjson
[14:04:08] <robertmaxrees> `ULT and did you read the docs?
[14:04:13] <robertmaxrees> "Specific markup required for dismiss-on-next-click"
[14:04:15] <`ULT> yes
[14:04:35] <robertmaxrees> so do that and you're golden.
[14:04:49] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, you'll need another click handler on document.
[14:05:11] <`ULT> I think I need unfurtunately a click handler on document indeed.
[14:05:20] <robertmaxrees> "unfortunately" lol
[14:05:25] <`ULT> When I change the <p> in <a> same storey
[14:05:27] <`ULT> story
[14:05:32] <`ULT> or is that better?
[14:05:36] <`ULT> I`m a newb :)
[14:05:37] <robertmaxrees> is what better?
[14:05:52] <robertmaxrees> i'd change the markup to make it work.
[14:06:03] <`ULT> I was thinking build in functionality is better than another click handler
[14:06:08] <robertmaxrees> correct.
[14:06:19] <robertmaxrees> so fix your markup and stuff will work.
[14:06:57] <robertmaxrees> you did read ALL of the docs, right?
[14:07:00] <`ULT> But that means, I can`t call the popover on a P element right?
[14:07:08] <robertmaxrees> you included the popover init?
[14:07:14] <`ULT> only on <a> with specific markup
[14:12:00] <`ULT> I tried several things, but I dont think I can use popover in combination with a click button
[14:12:19] <`ULT> Only when I click directly on #quantitybox it is working correct
[14:13:08] <`ULT> https://jsfiddle.net/VUZhL/2589/
[14:15:07] <robertmaxrees> because you're not initializing the popovers correctly.
[14:15:12] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/VUZhL/2590/
[14:15:19] <robertmaxrees> $('#quantitybox').popover(); only inits one.
[14:19:13] <`ULT> 1 moment
[14:19:43] <robertmaxrees> per the BS docs.
[14:20:49] <`ULT> I understand what you have done, but I need only a popover on the <p>
[14:20:53] <`ULT> when clicking on <a>
[14:21:02] <`ULT> Now we have two popovers
[14:21:07] <robertmaxrees> okay.
[14:21:23] <robertmaxrees> so you want the <a> to trigger the popover on the <p>?
[14:21:29] <`ULT> yes that`s right.
[14:21:57] <robertmaxrees> then afaik, yes, you'll need the other event handler.
[14:22:34] <`ULT> Allright, thank you.
[14:22:46] <`ULT> Need to go now, wil try that in some hours.
[14:22:48] <`ULT> thanks for your help.
[14:22:50] <robertmaxrees> also fix your init and event bindings.
[14:22:52] <robertmaxrees> :)
[14:22:58] <`ULT> yes, will do that :)
[14:23:00] <robertmaxrees> ]err, event handlers
[14:23:58] <`ULT> what do you mean with fix your event handlers?
[14:24:05] <`ULT> which one?
[14:24:23] <robertmaxrees> var qty = "0"
[14:24:30] <robertmaxrees> then if (qty == 0) {
[14:24:51] <`ULT> what is wrong with that? :p
[14:24:58] <robertmaxrees> should always use === when doing comparisons unless it's to null.
[14:24:59] <`ULT> This is at this moment only for this example.
[14:25:02] <`ULT> oow oke
[14:25:10] <`ULT> thanks. that is good to know
[14:25:17] <robertmaxrees> should never allow coercion for comparisons.
[14:25:26] <robertmaxrees> also you can shortcut that into just if (!qty) instead.
[15:17:01] <JumpY> Is there any way to get a result back from an $.get command in Jquery? I open a .php script and give some data to it and now I want to see if the script ends with an return variable. (For debug only with a display alert) Is this possible?
[15:17:28] <taplar> what do you mean a result back?
[15:18:52] <JumpY> $.get('mail.php?x=x&y=y&z=z') for example. When the mail.php script is complete, it should send a "X,Y,Z" back, to the jquery script and this should alert the value on my display.
[15:19:27] <taplar> you get the results of an ajax request in one of the callbacks that async processes use
[15:20:04] <rubyonrailed> Does anyone know a client side spell check I could use?  I was going to try javascript Spellcheck, but it requires a different back end than what i'm currently using.
[15:20:28] <JumpY> My problem is that I want to send different emails from different php scripts. I use only one mail.php & want to use this for the different mails. I want to decide in the mail.php header if a variable is given or not and then change the layout with normal if clauses. That is what I want to test, if the mail.php detect the correct layout
[15:20:37] <JumpY> without sending 1000 Test emails from the server ^^
[15:21:17] <taplar> not sure what that has to do with how to handle the ajax response...
[15:21:49] <taplar> have you ever used ajax requests before?
[15:21:53] <JumpY> No
[15:22:00] <taplar> http://learn.jquery.com/ajax/key-concepts/
[15:25:07] <JumpY> And where I can see the response then? I use no console to see any logs?
[15:25:48] <taplar> you can use console log in one of the callbacks
[15:26:48] <JumpY> I will try something
[15:27:31] <robertmaxrees> weee
[15:27:42] <taplar> aloha
[15:27:58] <robertmaxrees> hola
[15:28:15] <JumpY> Ah, it works with a little workaround ;> Thanks
[15:28:26] <taplar> amen fatha
[15:30:46] <robertmaxrees> how's it going taplar?
[15:31:07] <taplar> asi asi.  trying to get my local functional test to run
[15:31:17] <robertmaxrees> joy
[15:32:21] <taplar> yeah, heh. i made a qa mad earlier when i changed on of our pipelines to point to a feature branch, ^_^
[15:32:21] <taplar> outlaw taplar
[16:08:41] <JumpY> @ taplar, thanks for your help, it worked
[16:08:50] <taplar> awesome
[17:03:38] <taplar> ajax, the bane of javascript programmers
[17:12:32] <ajpiano> and stubborn toilet stains
[17:12:42] <taplar> boom
[17:20:50] <Audlex> would anyone know why scrollTop: $('.someClass').offset().top would scroll to a different position on chrome and firefox?
[17:21:37] <Audlex> it is only off by about 30px or so
[17:22:12] <shoky> they don't necessarily have the same defaults for margins/padding/etc..
[17:23:21] <Audlex> good point. the site uses a reset but perhaps not perfectly
[18:02:43] <carpii> i have a floating div with some text. If the user tries to select this text, they can often end up selecting other (and unpredictable) parts of the DOM, due to the way browser selection works. Is there anyway I can prevent this, so selection is limited to the div they started selecting in?
[18:03:05] <robertmaxrees> some kind of click to copy lib maybe?
[18:03:23] <carpii> Ive got the copying nailed down, the problem is purely the selection
[18:03:39] <robertmaxrees> that's why click to copy is nice :) takes care of both.
[18:03:44] <carpii> you know how you select some text, and then it suddenly breaks out and selects elements elsewhere in the page
[18:03:59] <carpii> ah you mean a button
[18:04:10] <carpii> hmm, wouldnt really work in my case
[18:04:11] <robertmaxrees> or something similar, yeah.
[18:04:20] <robertmaxrees> can make all the text a link or somethin'.
[18:04:22] <robertmaxrees> just an idea.
[18:04:32] <carpii> its a chatroom and I want to allow them to select arbitrary sections of text (like irc for example)
[18:04:33] <robertmaxrees> no real way to limit selection area last i checked.
[18:04:48] <carpii> without selecting the button divs and all kinds of crap
[18:04:52] <carpii> damn, ok
[18:05:10] <robertmaxrees> you can bind click handers to random parts thiough.
[18:05:23] <carpii> how do you mean?
[18:05:58] <robertmaxrees> i've seen things where they pop up a small "click to copy" icon on mouseenter and then you click that to copy that text.
[18:06:03] <robertmaxrees> all kinds of options.
[18:06:40] <carpii> hm yeah, news sites mostly i think
[18:06:50] <carpii> problem is that still doesnt limit selection afaik
[18:07:09] <carpii> imagine you select text form irc, and then it also selects some icons on your desktop
[18:07:20] <carpii> thats the kinda problem im facing
[18:07:59] <carpii> only idea i have atm is to shove a hidden delimiter at the start and end of each chatroom line
[18:08:13] <carpii> and then when they select text, i discard anything which isnt surrounded by those delimiters
[18:08:20] <carpii> but seems clumsy :/
[23:13:51] <physikoi> Hello #jquery. Is there some shorthand for something like this:`if (x) { $ob.html(x);}`? Like, is there a way to reference x implicitly?
