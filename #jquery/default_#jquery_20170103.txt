[04:39:36] <sequel> hello
[04:43:14] <grumbero> hi
[04:46:29] <grumbero> i have lots of links (270) and i bind the click-event to them. according to $._data(myelement, 'events') the click-event is properly bound but if i click on some of the links the click-event isn't called. any idea why/how?
[05:02:14] <Uhkis> grumbero: not without the code
[06:53:03] <pippuccio76> Hi at all , sorry for english , i upload file with ajax and formdata , the script work but i must wait too many time to get the response. Can i get response at end of upload and allow user to see other page but run the script in background
[07:04:26] <pippuccio76> Hi at all , sorry for english , i upload file with ajax and formdata , the script work but i must wait too many time to get the response. Can i get response at end of upload and allow user to see other page but run the script in background
[07:09:06] <Woet> pippuccio76: could you repeat that please
[07:09:08] <Woet> i didnt quite get it
[07:11:44] <pippuccio76> ok i repeat : hi, :-D
[07:16:24] <dglambert> morning
[09:59:34] <`slikts> hey comrades
[09:59:39] <`slikts> what is best autocomplete plugin for j queries
[10:00:21] <__rob2> hello
[10:01:06] <__rob2> if I select some elements say $('.myclass img').each( function(item) {} )
[10:01:09] <__rob2> item is an int
[10:01:21] <__rob2> how am I meant to access the actual element ?
[10:01:22] <`slikts> you need a tutorial
[10:01:35] <`slikts> not irc
[10:18:05] <taplar> __rob2: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.each/  the first argument is the index
[10:34:23] <robsco> should it be possible to have a click even on some anchor tags, and when one is fired, the function removes the click event from them all, including itself?
[10:35:43] <robsco> if i set $('#dates a').click() on them to simply return false, does that actually add to the "list" of events?  ie, can you have multiple events on a single element?
[10:36:15] <taplar> yes you can have multiple events
[10:36:46] <taplar> to remove a specific event handler from an element, it needs to be named, or you need a reference to it, and then you use off() with it
[10:36:50] <robsco> right, what's a safe way to replace the original event?  i don't just want to turn it off, since then the browser goes to #, meaning top of the page
[10:37:32] <taplar> to replace would to be to take it off() and then put something else on it
[10:37:54] <taplar> or use a delegate binding and change the elements so that they no longer match the filter
[10:39:18] <robsco> how would i go about using off() to target the original event?  i've currently just got it set with an anon function, not dealt with references in js
[10:40:28] <taplar> $(element).off('event', eventHandler)
[10:40:41] <taplar> so if you originally did something like
[10:40:52] <taplar> $('.menu').on('click', toggleMenu)
[10:40:57] <taplar> then you'd use off to remove it
[10:41:25] <robsco> right, so just declare my function with a name, and use that, simple as?
[10:41:30] <taplar> yep
[10:41:37] <robsco> thanks, will give it all a whirl
[10:41:39] <taplar> you have to have a name if you want to remove a single handler
[10:41:47] <taplar> name/reference
[10:41:53] <robsco> ok
[11:43:56] <grumbero> hi, currently i am using 1.10.2 and i think i encountered a bug with ff. should i upgrade to 1.12.4 or 2.x/3.x?
[11:54:19] <taplar> what browser support are you required to have as far as IE goes?
[12:03:51] <grumbero> none, all users use firefox
[12:08:59] <taplar> then you should be safe upgrading to 2x, or try 3x and if that doesn't work try 2x
[12:09:35] <taplar> the difference between 1x and 2x is older IE support
[12:10:11] <taplar> 3x also doesn't have older IE support but it also had other changes to the library that are different from 2x
[12:18:43] <grumbero> https://jsfiddle.net/wye1q82m/ <-- i try to display the two links but it doesn't show up if i click on the text "show dialog". can you give me a hint why this fails?
[12:19:19] <grumbero> taplar: thanks
[12:20:11] <grumbero> as soon as i get this fiddle to work i try to show my real problem happening here
[12:20:24] <duch_kazatel> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/yke0v9e8/1/
[12:20:35] <duch_kazatel> newest jquery is weird with jqui
[12:20:38] <duch_kazatel> grumbero ^
[12:24:45] <grumbero> duch_kazatel: thanks, now it seems to work. in my local test the second add-link never works if i jump down by searching with ff and clicking on it. if i scroll down with the mouse it works just fine. but this only happens if the new link is not visible before jumping down there. locally i was able to verify with jquery 1.10.2 with ui 1.10.4 and the newest 1x-versions.
[12:25:12] <duch_kazatel> grumbero your fiddle was using jq 3.x
[12:25:14] <duch_kazatel> (shrug)
[12:25:31] <grumbero> oh, sorry, not really good with fiddle yet
[12:28:59] <grumbero> ok, i am able to reproduce it here: https://jsfiddle.net/yke0v9e8/2/  use firefox (here 50.1), click onto the link "show dialog", search for "text2" to jump down to the second link and click on "add". then it just jumps up. if you scroll down it properly shows the popup. can anybody of you verify this behaviour?
[12:29:37] <duch_kazatel> uh.
[12:29:38] <duch_kazatel> heh
[12:29:51] <duch_kazatel> you're including jquery twice in that fiddle fwiw.
[12:30:02] <duch_kazatel> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/yke0v9e8/4/
[12:30:03] <duch_kazatel> this doesn't.
[12:30:42] <grumbero> does jquery ui always include jquery? thought this was just an addon
[12:30:48] <duch_kazatel> errr.
[12:30:52] <duch_kazatel> it doesn't.
[12:30:57] <duch_kazatel> but click the javascript gear icon.
[12:31:08] <duch_kazatel> jquery ui requires jquery to run.
[12:31:25] <duch_kazatel> but it doesn't include it on its own.  but jsfiddle gives you a way to include both pretty easilyt.
[12:32:30] <grumbero> ok, right, i didn't find the "plain js" first
[12:33:45] <grumbero> https://jsfiddle.net/yke0v9e8/5/ <-- here i removed the normal jquery/jqueryui inclusion and did it explicitly with external ressources. here i can see the behaviour i described above. hope i didn't do any more of those beginner mistakes
[12:34:07] <duch_kazatel> you're not including any css that jqui needs.
[12:34:08] <duch_kazatel> but ok.
[12:34:21] <grumbero> yes, it wasn't necessary for this test
[12:34:37] <duch_kazatel> lol
[12:35:14] <duch_kazatel> so the issue is that the event handler for addlinks doesn't fire if you search for the modal body and jump that way.
[12:35:25] <grumbero> correct
[12:36:35] <grumbero> with ie11 it seems to work just fine, until now i was only able to reproduce it with ff
[12:37:42] <duch_kazatel> so did you try removing your jqui use and confirm that's not it?
[12:38:26] <duch_kazatel> because https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/yke0v9e8/6/ seems to work.
[12:38:30] <duch_kazatel> so what does that tell us?
[12:39:35] <grumbero> i need the modal dialog and as i'm not really good at js yet i relied for the dialog-function and styling onto jqui.
[12:39:51] <duch_kazatel> how does this issue happen when using the css then?
[12:40:16] <grumbero> it shows the same behaviour
[12:40:24] <duch_kazatel> i have a hard time believing that.
[12:40:46] <duch_kazatel> a modal body should fit into the window.
[12:40:49] <duch_kazatel> no scrolling neede.
[12:40:51] <duch_kazatel> *needed
[12:41:02] <grumbero> ok, yeah, but in the modal window i can scroll
[12:41:14] <duch_kazatel> that's a huge modal.
[12:41:15] <duch_kazatel> wowzer.
[12:41:15] <duch_kazatel> okay.
[12:43:01] <grumbero> so any idea how to dig into this or how to solve it?
[12:43:29] <duch_kazatel> sounds like it has something to do with the way the jqui css works in relation to the browser and recognizing event handlers and stuff.
[12:44:01] <duch_kazatel> i'll bet it has to do with element focus.
[12:45:22] <grumbero> i admit i don't have a clue how to proceed here
[12:45:56] <duch_kazatel> try binding listeners to element focus events and see what happens.
[12:49:54] <grumbero> if i bind onto the focus events it is triggered once when i open the modal and 15x when i click onto the second link
[12:50:18] <duch_kazatel> which element are you binding to?
[12:50:33] <grumbero> https://jsfiddle.net/yke0v9e8/7/
[12:50:42] <grumbero> onto addlinks
[12:50:48] <duch_kazatel> heh
[12:50:52] <duch_kazatel> also: why alerts()?
[12:50:57] <duch_kazatel> why not console.log()
[12:51:24] <grumbero> because in my first test i didn't rely onto anything any more :)
[12:52:09] <duch_kazatel> yeah this is all about elements not handling losing focus very well.
[12:52:10] <duch_kazatel> funky.
[12:52:11] <grumbero> https://jsfiddle.net/yke0v9e8/8/
[12:53:23] <duch_kazatel> (shrug) same thing.
[12:53:43] <grumbero> dammit :)
[12:55:15] <grumbero> am i too late or why is this channel currently so quiet? (hoping for some jquery-geeks having a look onto this problem once and solving it immediately) :D
[12:55:25] <duch_kazatel> errr.
[12:55:33] <duch_kazatel> it's around 10 in the morning PST.
[12:55:39] <duch_kazatel> and your issue is unusual.
[12:55:40] <duch_kazatel> but ok.
[12:55:45] <grumbero> hehe, ok
[12:55:55] <grumbero> will come back later again with it
[12:57:21] <grumbero> thanks for your help!
[13:08:49] <taplar> duch_kazatel, the man.... not quite geeky enough
[13:08:55] <duch_kazatel> apparently.
[13:11:59] <duch_kazatel> i don't know anything ;__
[13:12:17] <taplar> first step to enlightenment i hear
[13:30:07] <taplar> and unemployment
[13:33:22] <Trinity> whats the difference between global.$ and global.jQuery?
[13:33:30] <Trinity> is $ just an alias?
[13:33:33] <duch_kazatel> global.$ = global.jQuery
[13:33:35] <duch_kazatel> basically.
[13:33:45] <Trinity> but internally jQuery uses global.jQuery?
[13:33:53] <duch_kazatel> internally it's using jQuery.
[13:34:01] <Trinity> ah gotcha I guess that makes sense
[13:34:07] <Trinity> since other modules may use $
[13:34:12] <duch_kazatel> bingo
[13:34:12] <Trinity> thanks!
[13:42:49] <Trinity> duch_kazatel, it seems like jquery-ui only uses global.$ in it's implementation
[13:42:53] <Trinity> am I correct in that assumption?
[13:42:56] <duch_kazatel> dunno.
[13:42:59] <duch_kazatel> i haven't looked.
[13:43:03] <duch_kazatel> i wouldn't be surprised though.
[13:43:12] <Trinity> are they from the same vendor?
[13:43:25] <duch_kazatel> jquery ui and jquery are maintained by the JS foundation, yes
[13:43:28] <Trinity> seems strange that it would use global.$ instead
[13:43:34] <Trinity> if global.$ is an alias
[13:43:37] <duch_kazatel> that's actually pretty standard.
[13:46:09] <shoky> Trinity it doesn't use global.$ and if you're using browserify (as you are and forgot to mention here..) then it uses require('jquery')  no globals.
[13:46:18] <duch_kazatel> hahahaha
[13:46:25] <duch_kazatel> well there you go.
[13:46:56] <taplar> i figured it'd use an IIFE to pass jQuery in as $.  huh
[13:47:38] <shoky> it might, the question is where it got jQuery from ;p
[13:48:03] <Trinity> shoky, hmm but that would mean var $ = require("jquery"); require("jquery-ui") would work
[13:48:12] <Trinity> but my bundled js refuses to work
[13:48:44] <Trinity> window.$ = window.jQuery = require("jquery"); require("jquery-ui") is the only thing that works
[13:48:54] <shoky> Trinity: and that works, as i told you in the other channel.
[13:49:08] <shoky> Trinity: show your full code and package.json  if you want help troubleshooting
[13:49:47] <Trinity> well this is just confusing me more. I think I got it. Looking at the jquery-ui.js sourcecode it doesnt require jquery at all
[13:49:54] <shoky> also say what's not working when you say it's not working ;p
[13:49:57] <Trinity> it uses $ instead so it makes sense
[13:50:11] <Trinity> shoky, everythings working now. I'm just trying to figure out what happened :)
[13:50:14] <shoky> which jquery-ui.js are you looking at..?
[13:50:22] <Trinity> npm jquery-ui
[13:50:44] <Trinity> http://pastebin.com/s5zqCbwG
[13:58:19] <shoky> Trinity: sorry, you're right :) my bad
[13:59:02] <Trinity> cool! :) glad that got clarified on both ends
[13:59:12] <Trinity> now I can move on haha!
[13:59:12] <shoky> totally forgot about a little change i did to get it working like that. it was a while ago ;p
[13:59:28] <Trinity> thanks shoky :)
[13:59:31] <shoky> :)
[14:00:44] <shoky> Trinity but btw it doesnt use global.$  it uses the global 'jQuery'  (line 24 in your paste)
[14:04:01] <Trinity> shoky, ah you're right! thanks again :)
[14:09:04] <Trinity> shoky, I am a bit confused though. Assuming that factory is a function being passed how is that line even being called without module.exports?
[14:20:26] <taplar> which line?
[14:20:31] <shoky> Trinity: the factory function being passed is the function on line 26
[14:20:57] <shoky> Trinity: the expression starting in line 16 is an IIFE that is executed right away, being passed that factory function
[14:21:06] <Trinity> shoky, right but how does this file get called? the anonymous function started on line 16 is never executed
[14:21:09] <Trinity> oh is it?
[14:21:30] <shoky> yea
[14:21:42] <Trinity> shoky, but doesnt that function end at line 733?
[14:21:48] <Trinity> which is } ) );
[14:22:14] <Trinity> ahh
[14:22:22] <Trinity> I get it now :) thanks again shoky haha
[14:22:26] <shoky> ;)
[14:38:15] <grumbero> hi, in this fiddle ( https://jsfiddle.net/yke0v9e8/8/ ) clicking on "show dialog", then search for "text2" to jump down to the second link and click on it, the click-event isn't triggered. if i scroll down with the mouse and click on it, it works just fine. any idea/hint why this doesn't work?
[14:52:59] <python785> is there a speed difference in loading scripts via an external js file vs the internal <script> tag ?
[15:14:36] <taplar> you mean a linked script vs the script being in the page already?
[15:15:56] <taplar> linked script can be slower the first hit as it has to do another web request to get it, so all the network latency and such will be added.
[15:16:04] <taplar> after the first time, it can be faster as it can be cached
[15:19:02] <python785> but once it is cached (especially with a browser like chrome for win/lin) that has an extreme amount of caching. it probably wouldn't be a problem ? I can imagine that it might be a bit slower by 0.5ms it is just a bit more clean to separate the files
[15:19:34] <taplar> sure.  caching is da bomb
[15:21:15] <taplar> wow, freenode i guess doesn't like me talking about cdns
[15:23:33] <taplar> siriously
[15:36:54] <Twyrfher> How can I addClass in http://jsfiddle.net/LxqjLwdb/ without clicking? just using the selected value of the radio buttons. When the year is different than "actual" is has to take the class of the selected radio button.
[15:39:06] <taplar> you mean you want it to start off with a color?
[15:41:00] <taplar> btw, ln 21-25 shouldn't be there.  it has the potential to bind multiple times as it is inside another event handler
[15:43:45] <Twyrfher> ahhh, I did it
[15:43:45] <Twyrfher> $(".range-slider-wrapper").addClass($(".extra-controls input[type=radio]:checked").val());
[15:44:32] <taplar> cool.  still, make sure to look at how you are doing your bindings
[15:45:34] <Twyrfher> is a mess my code. Isn't working as I want
[15:45:46] <Twyrfher> http://jsfiddle.net/sohkg24b/
[15:46:19] <Twyrfher> My idea is to avoid the change of color when the year is "actual", how could I do it?
[15:46:41] <taplar> ln 22-26 is still an issue.  and you can chain your methods so you don't have duplicate lookups.
[15:46:43] <Twyrfher> only when is different than "actual" i need to set the colors
[15:46:50] <Twyrfher> :o
[16:13:44] <plamb_> can you select like this in jquery
[16:13:47] <plamb_> $(this:nth-child(3n+1))
[16:14:03] <taplar> $('selector', this)
[16:14:33] <taplar> or actually $(this).filter
[16:14:40] <plamb_> so $.each(function(){ $(':nth-child(3n+1)')
[16:14:43] <plamb_> err
[16:14:46] <plamb_> '', this
[16:15:04] <taplar> what exactly are you trying to select?
[16:15:36] <plamb_> "every 3rd element in the set of matched elements"
[16:16:07] <taplar> 'this' being the matched elements?
[16:16:13] <plamb_> yes
[16:16:17] <plamb_> as it iterates through
[16:16:18] <taplar> yah, use filter
[16:16:28] <plamb_> how would you use filter there
[16:16:39] <plamb_> on the index somehow
[16:16:43] <taplar> is this logic inside some jQuery.fn method?
[16:16:49] <shoky> nth-child doesn't care about the set of matched elements
[16:16:50] <plamb_> yes
[16:16:54] <plamb_> hang on
[16:16:57] <shoky> it cares about children and parents
[16:17:09] <plamb_> http://pastebin.com/12SK48Xs
[16:17:46] <taplar> this in that context is a single element
[16:17:52] <taplar> you are in an each
[16:18:03] <shoky> $().filter(function(i) { return i % 3 === 0 })
[16:18:10] <shoky> or whatever the equation should be there
[16:18:22] <plamb_> so i should run the each then run a separate filter
[16:18:31] <taplar> i>0 && i%3 === 0 ?
[16:19:00] <shoky> mm dont think so ;p
[16:19:04] <taplar> or i'm forgetting if i starts off as 0 or 1
[16:19:12] <shoky> as 0
[16:19:29] <taplar> i>0 && i%2 === 0
[16:19:33] <shoky> nah
[16:19:50] <taplar> 0 mod 2 is 0, :)
[16:19:52] <shoky> (i + 2) % 3 === 0    i guess
[16:20:02] <shoky> right, but so is 2 mod 2
[16:20:12] <taplar> which 2 would be the third element
[16:20:19] <shoky> and so is 4 mod 2 ..
[16:20:28] <taplar> eww
[16:20:40] <shoky> it's definitely gonna be % 3
[16:21:50] <plamb_> so it would be (i + 2) % 3 === 0 ?
[16:22:29] <taplar> do you want to exclude the very first element?
[16:22:39] <shoky> (i + 1) % 3 === 0
[16:22:57] <shoky> ^ that excludes the 3rd, 6th, and so on
[16:22:57] <taplar> yeah, that
[16:23:16] <plamb_> fixing that css means running an each, filter, each
[16:23:18] <plamb_> nasty
[16:23:35] <plamb_> bad grid is bad
[16:23:46] <plamb_> guess its better than a trip to the database
[16:25:09] <shoky> er, includes, not excludes
[16:32:24] <plamb_> will hasClass("show") return true if an elem has class="someclass show"
[16:32:37] <taplar> yep
[16:33:06] <taplar> though i would suggest you try to think it more in terms of dom elements, not the markup
[17:09:39] <plamb_> would this select every fourth element
[17:09:50] <plamb_> function(i){return (4*i)+4})
[17:10:58] <taplar> that'd return everything
[17:11:14] <taplar> a non zero number is always truthy
[17:11:32] <plamb_> oh im confusing css and jquery
[17:11:36] <plamb_> need to use modulo eh
[17:12:21] <Velveeta> yeah, you would want something like function (i) { return (i + 1) % 4 === 0; }
[17:18:31] <plamb_> how about
[17:18:47] <plamb_> filtering for every element (starting at index 1) that is plus 3 indices away
[17:18:56] <plamb_> so element 4, 7, 10, 13 etc
[17:21:07] <taplar> i - 3 % 3
[17:21:50] <plamb_> hmmm
[17:22:20] <taplar> each one of those elements has an index one less, so they are all multiples of 3
[17:23:31] <plamb_> so filter(function(i){return (i -3) % 3} ?
[17:24:22] <taplar> the equation has to return true for those that you want to include
[17:26:21] <plamb_> well that worked and im not sure why :)
[17:26:23] <plamb_> ty
[17:28:39] <shoky> i - 3 % 3    is same as  i % 3
[17:28:51] <shoky> mod be mod
[17:29:00] <taplar> i -3 removes 0
[17:29:21] <shoky> he wanted the first i though
[17:29:33] <taplar> idk
[17:29:51] <taplar> i thought he said the third ones after the first one
[17:30:30] <plamb_> 4th, 7th, 10th, 13th is what i wanted
[17:30:34] <shoky> adonno, i just saw <plamb_> filtering for every element (starting at index 1)
[17:30:47] <plamb_> like 3n+1 would do in css
[17:31:25] <taplar> that would get index 1 as well
[17:31:31] <shoky> anyway doing  i - 3  to get rid of the first is kinda meh ;p
[17:31:34] <shoky> be explicit
[17:32:02] <taplar> unless css starts at 1 and not zero
[17:32:51] <taplar> filter i % 3 and then slice(1), lol
[17:33:24] <plamb_> css does start at 1
[18:16:46] <quechon> guys i need a little help here
[18:16:55] <quechon> https://paste.pound-python.org/show/ahwV2OVN7ljq6nQm0CjA/
[18:17:47] <quechon> in that code when i try to post something the list of data that is supposed to be store in output says undefined
[18:18:19] <quechon> but when i hit refresh it shows back what i want
[18:18:49] <taplar> what is ln 25 doing?
[18:20:29] <quechon> saving all the copies from the loop
[18:20:42] <taplar> really?
[18:20:54] <taplar> how so?
[18:22:08] <quechon> because the way i was trying before wasnt working
[18:22:23] <taplar> that's not answering my question
[18:22:30] <quechon> im trying to find the way to avoid pasting html code in js script
[18:22:34] <taplar> you're assuming it's doing something.  i'm asking you why you think that
[18:22:51] <SzateX> Hi - i'm trying to implement into: https://kodziarze.tk/nope/in.html this: https://github.com/bqworks/slider-pro - but if you can see, on start the first slide have added unnescecary translate3d (after change slide and come back it works very nice). And i have no idea how to repair it
[18:23:24] <quechon> i really dont know why is doing it
[18:23:48] <taplar> what does $('#copy') do?
[18:28:11] <quechon> http://jsbin.com/puracaxude/edit?html,css,js,output
[18:28:31] <taplar> that's not an answer
[18:28:58] <taplar> you should be able to tell my in a few words what that operation does
[18:29:51] <quechon> im copying all the html code from inside copy
[18:30:04] <quechon> and adding it to output
[18:30:21] <taplar> cool
[18:30:33] <taplar> so what does any of that have to do with the data returned?
[18:32:10] <quechon> that when i use the post data to server the .done from post is supposed to call a get request function and display all the html stored in output but instead i get undefined
[18:32:30] <quechon> then when i refresh the page i get the output desired
[18:32:59] <taplar> i need to see a more complete example then
[18:33:38] <taplar> oh, wait, postPosts
[18:34:25] <taplar> yeah, i still don't see where you are using the data
[18:34:28] <taplar> from either call
[18:35:27] <quechon> in line 30 thats where is being used
[18:35:42] <quechon> in success post calls loadpost
[18:36:13] <quechon> and loadpost makes a get request to server
[18:36:13] <taplar> line 30 is setting the html that was on the page, duplicating it the number of posts you had
[18:36:29] <taplar> that done method is at no point taking the data and putting it on the page
[18:36:42] <taplar> it's just pulling the existing dom nodes
[18:37:01] <quechon> so that could be the issue
[18:37:03] <taplar> which, btw, is going to be creating invalid markup cause your going to have duplicate ids all over the place, from your jsbin example
[18:37:15] <taplar> lol
[18:37:26] <taplar> that's why i asked what you thought it was doing.  and you said exactly what it was doing
[18:39:19] <quechon> what do you suggest instead of duplicating ids
[18:39:26] <taplar> use classes instead
[18:39:31] <quechon> ok
[18:40:01] <taplar> anything that repeats can't be an id
[18:40:39] <taplar> the browser won't blow up on you, but it's invalid markup and your javascript will have all kinds of issues if you are trying to select by them
[18:41:13] <quechon> one more question what do you think is the best approached to copy that html code that i wanna copy duplicate it and at the same time change some of the content inside
[18:41:31] <taplar> i'd suggest using some sort of a templating engine
[18:41:50] <quechon> because as far as i can see once i store the data inside output i cannot edit whats inside
[18:42:20] <taplar> you can write your own if it's not a lot, otherwise you can use an existing one like moustachejs or handlebarsjs
[18:44:40] <quechon> i see
[18:45:13] <quechon> thanks alot i really appreciate your help really helpfull
[18:45:32] <taplar> good deal.  hope it helps
[18:45:45] <quechon> im gonna look into handlebarsjs to see how that works
[18:46:01] <taplar> i use that on my personal site.  luv it
[18:46:51] <quechon> ok thanks
[18:56:50] <Aljone> ehy guys somehing weird is going on.. i see file on my reasonese *.less but in my project there is none
[18:57:07] <duch_kazatel> bummer
[18:57:57] <duch_kazatel> Aljone is that file serving from your domain oooorrrr...
[18:58:16] <Aljone> yes my domain
[18:58:20] <duch_kazatel> ;'kay.
[18:58:27] <duch_kazatel> without seeing it none of us can really help ;)
[18:58:30] <duch_kazatel> fwiw.
[18:58:35] <taplar> what is 'reasonese'?
[18:58:43] <Aljone> localhost/app_clone/css/less/responsive-utilities.less
[18:58:46] <duch_kazatel> response i'm guessing
[18:58:50] <Aljone> the less folder is not ever exist
[18:58:52] <Aljone> nor the file
[18:59:06] <duch_kazatel> Aljone you getting a 400 for it?
[18:59:09] <Aljone> yes
[18:59:09] <duch_kazatel> or a 200 or something?
[18:59:24] <Aljone> 400The requested URL /app_clone/css/less/responsive-utilities.less was not found on this server.
[18:59:26] <duch_kazatel> lol then you'll never fine the file on your hard drive.
[18:59:34] <duch_kazatel> because it's... not there.
[18:59:43] <Aljone> i know its not there so how come its on my css effecting my html styles
[18:59:45] <duch_kazatel> your codebase is trying to serve tht up.
[18:59:51] <Aljone> i see it on my console
[18:59:53] <duch_kazatel> wait you said itwas a 400.
[19:00:06] <taplar> bad request
[19:00:09] <duch_kazatel> errr, 4xx - like is it a 404?
[19:00:10] <Aljone> i get not found
[19:00:22] <duch_kazatel> then it's not impacting your site styles.
[19:00:35] <Aljone> thats what wierd it is
[19:00:45] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[19:00:46] <Aljone> i see it on my console element .. when i choose the element
[19:00:46] <taplar> cleared your cache recently?
[19:01:11] <duch_kazatel> also: any plugins running?
[19:01:24] <Aljone> jquery ui
[19:01:26] <Aljone> bootstrap
[19:01:30] <duch_kazatel> i mean in your browser.
[19:01:32] <duch_kazatel> extensions.
[19:01:34] <Aljone> hmm
[19:01:39] <Aljone> im not sure let me see
[19:01:50] <taplar> what do you mean you see it on the element, btw?
[19:01:57] <Aljone> but even if there are it doesnt make sense its directying to my project folder
[19:02:19] <duch_kazatel> (shrug) could be a bad plugin trying to point to a resource using a bad URL.
[19:02:30] <duch_kazatel> otherwise, it's pretty hard to help without seeing it.
[19:03:16] <Aljone> but if that was the case how could it be that i see the css on the console
[19:03:29] <duch_kazatel> so what do you mean by that?
[19:03:34] <duch_kazatel> "i see the css on the console" - wut?
[19:04:00] <Aljone> when i open my dev tools
[19:04:03] <Aljone> choose the element
[19:04:09] <duch_kazatel> screenshot
[19:04:09] <Aljone> i see the css effecting on the right side
[19:04:11] <Aljone> ok
[19:04:13] <Aljone> wait
[19:04:20] <taplar> originating from the file that gets a 404
[19:04:29] <duch_kazatel> ^^^ this sounds like BS
[19:04:35] <taplar> i'd say clear cache
[19:05:53] <taplar> but, another question.  why are you importing less files?
[19:07:00] <duch_kazatel> something tells me he isn't meaning to?
[19:07:12] <Aljone> https://s24.postimg.org/mo9vxsw79/test.jpg
[19:07:21] <Aljone> LOOk at that on the right side
[19:07:54] <taplar> what happens if you click or ctrl+click that file in the RHS
[19:07:55] <Aljone> responsive-utilities.less < i can promise u that file is not exist
[19:08:21] <Aljone> nothing happened .. it open it on the dev tools but its empty
[19:08:36] <duch_kazatel> have you tried other browsers?
[19:08:44] <duch_kazatel> killed and reopened chrome?
[19:08:49] <duch_kazatel> restarted your machine?
[19:08:49] <duch_kazatel> etc
[19:08:56] <taplar> ctr+shift+del, remove all
[19:09:10] <Aljone> wait i restart browser
[19:09:14] <duch_kazatel> heh
[19:09:25] <duch_kazatel> try another browser fwiw.
[19:09:34] <Aljone> still the same
[19:09:44] <Aljone> im on chrome i dont want to change the browser
[19:09:46] <duch_kazatel> in another browser?
[19:09:48] <duch_kazatel> uh
[19:09:51] <taplar> lol
[19:09:56] <duch_kazatel> dude it's easy - just open another browser.
[19:10:02] <Aljone> i want to understand how something like that could ever happened
[19:10:07] <duch_kazatel> a glitch
[19:10:07] <Aljone> and how to fix it
[19:10:12] <duch_kazatel> i'm not saying you should use another browser permanently.
[19:10:16] <duch_kazatel> i'm giving you things to test with.
[19:10:19] <Aljone> ok wait
[19:10:22] <Aljone> Ill try IE
[19:10:24] <duch_kazatel> because your entire premise is, frankyl, insane.
[19:10:28] <duch_kazatel> :)
[19:11:05] <Aljone> i can get u teamviewer
[19:11:07] <Aljone> and u could see
[19:11:17] <taplar> is it the same in ie?
[19:11:17] <duch_kazatel> no thanks ;)
[19:11:21] <duch_kazatel> ^^
[19:12:38] <Aljone> i clearned all cache and browser history cookies and so...
[19:12:42] <Aljone> nothing its still there
[19:12:45] <duch_kazatel> and the other browser?
[19:12:48] <duch_kazatel> same thing?
[19:13:45] <Aljone> yes
[19:14:13] <taplar> shot in the dark.  you're not including 'responsive-utilities.less' twice are you?
[19:14:18] <duch_kazatel> heh
[19:14:23] <Aljone> there is a refrence for that file on bootstrap.css.map
[19:14:27] <Aljone> i deleted those files
[19:14:30] <taplar> dunno how that would affect the inspector if the first one had rules and the second one was 404
[19:14:38] <Aljone> im not including it at all
[19:14:57] <duch_kazatel> have you made changes to boostrap files?
[19:15:07] <duch_kazatel> and, if so, have you re-built bootstrap correctly?
[19:15:19] * taplar sneaks out the door
[19:15:21] <duch_kazatel> what happens if you swap to a plain BS install?
[19:15:33] <taplar> heh, bs install
[19:15:59] <Aljone> i removed those files where it  have refrence to but it still apear
[19:16:10] <duch_kazatel> so you killed the .map file?
[19:16:15] <duch_kazatel> and your server isn't caching anything?
[19:17:36] <Aljone> how do i clear cache complietly on CHROME
[19:17:48] <duch_kazatel> i thought you were getting the same issue on other browsers.
[19:17:53] <duch_kazatel> have you restarted your machine?
[19:18:07] <Aljone> its production server i cant restart it now
[19:18:09] <Aljone> ppl working on it
[19:18:13] <duch_kazatel> your computer.
[19:18:14] <duch_kazatel> not the server.
[19:18:15] <Aljone> yes
[19:18:22] <Aljone> my computer im testing on is a server
[19:18:29] <Aljone> but anyways
[19:18:35] <duch_kazatel> so you're hitting the server with a web browser on the same server?
[19:18:36] <Aljone> how do i clear the cach?
[19:18:58] <duch_kazatel> i mean...
[19:18:59] <duch_kazatel> https://www.google.com/search?q=chrome+clear+cache
