[11:56:35] <caliel> good morning
[11:57:00] <caliel> how can I achieve the goal of having $.each to wait for ajax form submission before going on? Thanks.
[12:32:04] <taplar> caliel the $.each should go in the ajax callback
[12:45:43] <paul_irish> jQuery represent
[12:47:20] <taplar> what though?
[12:48:57] <caliel> taplar: how?
[12:49:36] <taplar> You're doing something like $.ajax({..., success:function(){}}) or $.ajax().then(function(){});
[12:49:41] <taplar> the $.each would go in that callback
[12:49:52] <robertmaxrees> (prefer the .then() version btw)
[12:51:04] <caliel> taplar: i am doing this: if there are <div data-rel="crud-popup" data-action="edit" data-url="{{ path('asdfasdf') }}></div>, $.each( $.ajax());
[12:51:13] <taplar> can't do that
[12:51:30] <caliel> taplar: first ajax call opens a modal with a form within. second ajax is on('submit') to process the form. then go to next "div".
[12:51:45] <caliel> reopen modal (second div), process second form and so on.
[12:51:57] <robertmaxrees> that doesn't change any of what he's saying :)
[12:51:59] <taplar> ajax is asynchronous.  you should not try to force it into procedure logic
[12:52:06] <taplar> you need to work with the concepts
[12:52:46] <taplar> First ajax call would happen, which would bind the submit handler in it's success
[12:52:59] <caliel> ok so if first div exists do ajax1 (modal) and ajax2 (form processing) .then redo the stuff for .each other existing div-placeholders ?
[12:52:59] <taplar> then that submit handler would kick off ajax, which on success would go to the next div
[12:53:37] <caliel> ok it seems lots of nesting, but I will try your suggestion
[12:53:51] <robertmaxrees> if you use promises, there's basically no nesting :)
[12:53:58] <taplar> doesn't have to be nesting if you extract methods
[12:54:00] <caliel> robertmaxrees: I tried with promises, nothing.
[12:54:15] <robertmaxrees> lol
[12:54:28] <caliel> of course I did wrong :P
[12:54:39] <caliel> my fault
[12:56:18] <caliel> ok thank you really much I will try with taplar suggestion and then re-try with promises - let you know
[12:56:53] <shoky_> caliel++
[12:57:30] <taplar> who woak the shoky?
[12:57:44] <shoky_> it might've been paul_irish
[12:58:03] <paul_irish> probly.
[12:58:18] <caliel> ?
[12:58:34] <robertmaxrees> solid group of dudes here
[12:58:38] <taplar> shoky is like a house diety.  it's rare to see him active
[12:58:39] <shoky_> caliel: i was commending you
[12:58:45] <paul_irish> shh bby is ok.
[12:59:11] <robertmaxrees> eeeets okay
[12:59:54] <caliel> shoky_: :) ok
[12:59:57] <caliel> Thank you all for your time.
[13:00:01] <caliel> Good night #jquery (UGT)
[13:00:15] <taplar> lol
[13:01:11] <shoky_> is that a timezone? or some meme
[13:02:38] <taplar> i feel like robert and i had a discussion about this a few days ago
[13:03:14] <robertmaxrees> we did.
[13:03:31] <robertmaxrees> universal greeting time.
[13:03:34] <robertmaxrees> kinda like FST
[13:03:34] <taplar> lol, i completely mind wiped it
[13:04:04] <taplar> freenode standard time
[13:04:32] <robertmaxrees> yar
[13:04:33] <shoky_> some meme, then :D
[13:04:54] <taplar> it's a timely joke
[13:05:01] <shoky_> lulz
[13:05:33] <robertmaxrees> lel
[15:37:20] <bestdesign> hey all
[15:44:37] <bestdesign> / $(this).val($.trim($(this).val()));
[15:44:39] <bestdesign> / $(this).val().trim();
[15:44:44] <bestdesign> someone can explain what the difference?
[15:44:58] <bestdesign> i mean on is inside but what way need that?
[15:50:26] <taplar> The second one is not updating the value
[15:54:51] <bestdesign> taplar: thank you
[16:11:02] <taplar> bestdesign and actually in the first case it should really just be `$(this).val($(this).val().trim())`.  Don't really need the `$.trim()` in that case.
[16:12:14] <taplar> then again, i'm not clear on why $.trim() exists anyway
[16:13:25] <taplar> mmm, looks like older browser support, String.prototype didn't have trim on it
[16:15:01] <taplar> good times
[19:29:31] <Coolternet> hello everyone.. i have an object and i need to output it on a selectbox. how can i do it ?
[19:50:16] <pavonia> Coolternet: What's the problem exactly?
[19:51:26] <Coolternet> im trying to fulling a SELECT with ajax
[19:53:57] <pavonia> You need to be a bit more specific. What have you tried? What was the outcome? etc.
[20:17:28] <Coolternet> https://cl.ly/0c288170dd47
[22:19:39] <shoky_> Coolternet: `data` is not an array.  `data.id` is the array you want to iterate
[22:20:31] <Coolternet> yeah i know but it doesn't work
[22:20:40] <shoky_> it?
[22:21:28] <shoky_> in the code you've shown, you're trying to iterate `data`
