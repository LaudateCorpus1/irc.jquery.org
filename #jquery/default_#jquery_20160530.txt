[00:10:20] <m_yuuki> I hope this isn't an overly stupid question
[00:10:47] <m_yuuki> But I can't seem to find any way to get the result of an ajax request into a variable
[00:11:13] <m_yuuki> It always returns undefined or an empty string (when I use a variable)
[01:56:17] <Gel> Hi
[01:56:45] <Gel> just want to ask what jquery version is supported in IE Edge
[01:57:17] <Gel> hello?
[01:57:18] <Gel> :)
[01:57:19] <Cork> Gel: all of them should work
[01:57:32] <Gel> Hi Cork.
[01:57:36] <Cork> (also this is irc, don't expect answers the same minute...)
[01:57:43] <Gel> but datepicker is not working
[01:57:54] <Cork> ah, well that is jquery ui
[01:58:08] <Cork> it has a different compatibility chart
[01:58:26] <Gel> do you know the versions working in IE Edge?
[01:59:22] <Cork> (btw it is microsoft edge not ie edge, ie is the old browser)
[01:59:42] <Cork> can't see any compatibility charts for edge
[01:59:49] <Cork> though i don't see why it shouldn't work there
[01:59:56] <Cork> can you define not working?
[02:01:33] <Gel> what is happening when I click the datepicker it shows like a Windows 10 datepicker instead of the application datepicker. It is like Windows 10 replaces the original datepicker UI of the application
[02:01:42] <Cork> ah
[02:01:57] <Cork> that is cause you used an input type="date" or type="datetime"
[02:02:02] <Gel> when I select a date out of the Windows 10 datepicker the system is not reading the value
[02:02:11] <Cork> you have to abort the focus event if i remember correctly
[02:02:15] <Cork> (it isn't edge specific)
[02:03:32] <Uhkis> wow, that edge datepicker is horrible
[02:05:16] <Cork> Uhkis: screenshot?
[02:05:28] <Gel> but still can use the input type date?
[02:05:39] <Cork> sure
[02:05:52] <Uhkis> Cork: http://html5doctor.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/edge-datepicker.png
[02:06:07] <Cork> Gel: an alternative is to convert the input field to a type="text" when you bind datepicker
[02:06:46] <Cork> just make sure you don't do it for older ies (ie7 and older) as they will throw an exception when you change input type
[02:07:00] <Cork> Uhkis: ouch
[02:07:02] <Gel> @Cork yap! that is exactly the datepicker interface showing in the application
[02:07:35] <Cork> and you're suppose to drag the columns with the mouse?
[02:07:54] <Cork> yay for touch first...
[02:08:33] <Uhkis> Cork: used scroll, but yeah, took a long long time to input my dob, and then it reset after i clicked outside of it (not noticing the buttons on the bottom)
[02:08:50] <Cork> >_<
[02:08:54] <Cork> lovely
[02:09:05] <Uhkis> perfect ux :D
[02:09:09] <Gel> okay Cork. great info! We'll try that. But just a confirmation. There are no specific jquery and jquery ui versions for Microsoft edge?
[02:09:11] <Cork> as always microsoft excels at user interfaces
[02:09:32] <Cork> Gel: there shouldn't have to be
[02:09:41] <Cork> Gel: edge is suppose to be web compatible
[02:09:54] <Gel> okay.. :D
[02:10:02] <Cork> except for small bugs and jquery takes care of those mostly
[02:10:39] <Cork> what you see here is just there native ui conflicting with your js
[02:10:47] <Cork> so not really a jquery ui problem
[02:11:56] <Gel> oh I see so more of the js code?
[02:12:26] <Cork> Gel: more about preventing the default behavior if you want the js features
[02:13:06] <Cork> Gel: most of the time one only use the js replacement if the native feature is missing
[02:13:14] <Cork> but here i see why you don't want to do that :D
[02:15:33] <Gel> sorry can you explain further Cork what do you mean by native UI, feature?
[02:23:07] <Cork> Gel: the datepicker the browsers show
[02:23:10] <Cork> for example
[02:23:32] <Cork> another example is validation errors the browser shows if you use form validation
[02:29:34] <Gel> Cork: Thank you so much
[02:38:41] <JavaLover> imma ask this again
[02:39:19] <Guest_84757> Allah is doing
[02:39:33] <Guest_84757> sun is not doing Allah is doing
[02:39:40] <JavaLover> is it better to replace a resulting response from the server via $('#myelement').html(response); or, have the html code as an element & simply upon recieving the right response, change the elements visibility from hidden to block?
[02:39:42] <Guest_84757> moon is not doing Allah is doing
[02:40:06] <Guest_84757> stars are not doing Allah is doing
[02:41:45] <Guest_84757> planets are not doing Allah is doing
[02:42:00] <Cork> Guest_84757: stop spamming
[02:42:09] <Cork> JavaLover: depends on the size of the change
[02:42:17] <Guest_84757> galaxies are not doing Allah is doing
[02:42:25] <JavaLover> I mean it's basically a div that says like "email sent"
[02:42:45] * Cork pings Uhkis 
[02:43:01] <Uhkis> pong
[02:43:01] <JavaLover> sooo on one hand I have like "oh we did send email give back response" on the other I have "change text of hidden element & show it"
[02:43:08] <Cork> Uhkis: you have ops right?
[02:43:21] <Uhkis> Cork: nope
[02:43:24] <Cork> ah...
[02:43:50] <Cork> JavaLover: then i would just have the element hidden
[02:44:21] <Uhkis> iirc this allah thing ended up in allah doing our parents, which is pretty nasty
[02:45:15] <Guest_84757> oceans are not doing Allah is doing
[02:45:24] <JavaLover> hmm that's how I was thinking about it Cork but like..what if you don't have javascript?
[02:45:31] <JavaLover> well in that case the full page is loaded right..
[02:45:38] <JavaLover> ugh this is hard lol
[02:46:16] <JavaLover> Cork so you do think showing a hidden element that is in place is better than just replacing the .html() of an element based on the response?
[02:46:32] <Guest_84757> mountains are not doing Allah is doing
[02:46:41] <Cork> JavaLover: when it is that little text ya
[02:46:52] <JavaLover> what if it's like a big screen
[02:47:07] <JavaLover> what if one section is like "login" and the other is "forgot password"
[02:47:32] <Guest_84757> trees are not doing Allah is doing
[02:47:44] <Guest_84757> mom is not doing Allah is doing
[02:47:50] <Cork> sigh....
[02:47:57] <Guest_84757> dad is not doing Allah is doing
[02:47:58] <JavaLover> Cork focus on me lol
[02:48:05] <Cork> JavaLover: there isn't a rigid rule
[02:48:12] <Guest_84757> boss is not doing Allah is doing
[02:48:16] <JavaLover> Well is there a way to tell if it's efficient?
[02:48:22] <JavaLover> like memory/speed wise?
[02:48:28] <JavaLover> what would I even look for in testing it?
[02:48:55] <Cork> JavaLover: speed has very little to do with this
[02:49:13] <JavaLover> so changing the dom is basically the same as hiding/showing an element?
[02:49:15] <Cork> what matters here is manageability
[02:49:31] <JavaLover> like does the browser read the html each time & display?
[02:49:38] <Cork> no, but neither of them are frequent enough or large enough to make much of a difference
[02:49:53] <JavaLover> well what happens on a .show(); vs .html();?
[02:50:06] <Cork> JavaLover: if your populate a 500 line table or modify the dom 5 times a second it matters
[02:50:17] <Cork> for a single message on validation, no it doesn't
[02:50:22] <Cork> ever
[02:50:32] <JavaLover> hmmm
[02:50:40] <JavaLover> so will the browser like cache the table?
[02:50:44] <Cork> JavaLover: what matters there is that holding a huge amount of dom content slows down the browser
[02:50:55] <Cork> JavaLover: the "cache" is the dom
[02:50:57] <JavaLover> so it's actually worse then to have a bunch of stuff in the dom?
[02:51:04] <Cork> but the html stream parser is very fast
[02:51:05] <Cork> so...
[02:51:28] <JavaLover> so the browser does read the html & display it each time?
[02:51:34] <Cork> no it uses the dom
[02:51:50] <JavaLover> so I can see like maybe images are cached right?
[02:52:01] <Cork> images are cached as it isn't dom content
[02:52:15] <Cork> same with the html content (but that isn't what is used to render the page)
[02:52:23] <JavaLover> but if I did like <img style = 'display:hidden' src = "img">
[02:52:32] <Cork> again that doesn't matter
[02:52:38] <Cork> <img> isn't the image
[02:52:44] <Cork> that is the dom element referencing the image
[02:52:52] <JavaLover> i see
[02:53:03] <JavaLover> so it wouldn't matter if i did .show(); vs I never had the <img> to begin with?
[02:53:05] <Cork> also it is display: none
[02:53:09] <Cork> or visibility: hidden
[02:53:13] <Cork> not display: hidden
[02:53:13] <JavaLover> and I did .html('<img>');
[02:53:21] <JavaLover> oh right i'm sorry
[02:53:24] <JavaLover> forgot the css but yeah
[02:53:41] <Cork> it really no as the browsers do lazy rendering of images now days
[02:53:45] <JavaLover> but adding the img to the dom is the same as showing it when it's already in the dom?
[02:54:00] <Cork> so it won't render the image until the element is not in a display: none tree
[02:54:06] <JavaLover> oh
[02:54:14] <JavaLover> oh well in that case then yeah obviously it's choice
[02:54:16] <Cork> one difference is that the display: none will still download the image
[02:54:25] <JavaLover> oh wait
[02:54:28] <JavaLover> so maybe that is better then..
[02:54:29] <Cork> so the network latency will go earlier
[02:54:41] <Cork> but you can pre cache the image if that matters
[02:54:48] <Cork> so no it still doesn't matter
[02:54:51] <JavaLover> hmmm image pre caching
[02:55:05] <JavaLover> what if I have an element displayed
[02:55:12] <JavaLover> and I want to hide it but save it in case you press back on browser
[02:55:22] <Cork> so again, don't over engineer it
[02:55:40] <Cork> do what makes the code easiest to maintain, it is seriously what matters here
[02:55:42] <JavaLover> well my initial plan was to just keep the html();
[02:55:51] <JavaLover> and that's how it does currently work btw
[02:55:56] <JavaLover> which it's awesome but...
[02:56:05] <JavaLover> is there a better way to ensure the image stays downloaded?
[02:56:19] <Cork> you can't NEVER count on the image staying downloaded
[02:56:39] <Cork> if cache eviction forces the image out it can be removed while still showing if your unlucky
[02:57:08] <Cork> it depends on cache and memory pressure
[02:57:09] <JavaLover> but is it better to just readd the html(); or display:block;
[02:57:17] <Cork> ...
[02:57:26] <Cork> i've answered this four times now...
[02:57:32] <Cork> i won't answer it again....
[02:57:40] <JavaLover> Okay it's all choice
[02:57:55] <Uhkis> ajpiano: is it you or someone else who should be contacted about operator status on this channel? we could really use active ones for this europe morning shift :)
[02:58:04] <JavaLover> But one last thing since we're discussing it I know you don't want to but
[02:58:13] <Cork> Uhkis: agreed
[02:58:31] <Cork> though the staff in freenode is quick to help
[02:58:44] <JavaLover> if I were to store the image outside of the dom as a javascript variable or something...is that even possible? or is the only way to store it to keep the img in the dom?
[02:58:47] <Cork> (though it is a bit bad to shove the burden on them)
[02:58:59] <Uhkis> Cork: exactly
[02:59:14] <JavaLover> what I mean is for display
[02:59:16] <Uhkis> since this problem is easily fixable with some more ops
[02:59:22] <JavaLover> like if you remove <img> will it always have to re,render that?
[02:59:42] <Cork> JavaLover: if you want to store the content locally there are several options
[02:59:43] <Saint_Isidore> I have a radio buttons with 3 options and I need automatically select the option to be set based on a var I'm creating from $_SESSION['selection'] data
[02:59:50] <Saint_Isidore> my current code looks like this: http://paste.ofcode.org/35famLVkz9YzAV98pyCiKSm
[03:00:10] <JavaLover> So you can store the image then, such that if you put the <img> tag back it will just grab it from memory instead of network?
[03:00:16] <Cork> JavaLover: you could store the generated dom elements out of dom (only matters if you planning to have 10k+ of elements)
[03:00:18] <Saint_Isidore> any suggestions would be appreciated
[03:00:44] <Cork> JavaLover: or you could make a <script type="text/template"></script> and store the html in there and inject it when you want it
[03:00:59] <Cork> JavaLover: but again it really only matters when you hit a lot of elements
[03:01:15] <JavaLover> I see and that's the most thorough answer i've gotten
[03:01:41] <JavaLover> but if you have same image path & it already downloaded that image..will it not attempt to dl again if you do .html(<img src= "downloadedimagepath">);
[03:01:56] <Cork> Saint_Isidore: why not just set the checked="checked" server side?
[03:02:20] <JavaLover> actualLY i can check this hold up
[03:02:22] <Cork> JavaLover: only if the image has been evicted from the browsers cache
[03:02:33] <JavaLover> or you can answer it haha, thx nice
[03:02:36] <JavaLover> okay that does answer my question
[03:02:48] <Cork> the browser will re render the image
[03:02:57] <Saint_Isidore> Cork thats a great idea...can you give me an example of what that might look like
[03:03:03] <Cork> but it already does this if it has to free memory so not much to care too much about
[03:03:12] <JavaLover> yeah no it sounds legit
[03:03:16] <JavaLover> imma test one thing but I like these answers
[03:03:18] <Cork> Saint_Isidore: uh... it would depends on the server language
[03:03:24] <Saint_Isidore> php
[03:03:29] <Cork> => ##php
[03:03:47] <Cork> but basically just add checked="checked" to the input tag in the html
[03:03:54] <Cork> *done*
[03:04:01] <Saint_Isidore> oh ok, I think I can do that :)
[03:04:34] <Cork> Saint_Isidore: also note  $_SESSION['selection'] is not accessible from js
[03:04:47] <Cork> so you can't really solve that easily in js
[03:04:48] <JavaLover> beautiful!!
[03:05:21] <JavaLover> okay Cork successfully answered my question thank you so much
[03:05:21] <Saint_Isidore> oh I was thinking about setting the $_SESSION value to a variable and conditionally run some js
[03:05:31] <JavaLover> so now I can know doing a .html(); will only be a big deal if it's a lot of text.
[03:05:37] <Saint_Isidore> but honestly I wasn't sure how to approach this
[03:05:43] <JavaLover> which you said initially but you saying it & me understanding it are 2 different things.
[03:05:47] <Cork> Saint_Isidore: you can't set them in a variable unless you mean echo it into a script tag (yuck)
[03:06:09] <JavaLover> I just tested by changing the html myself & putting like 50 copies of an image & watching it render instantly :D
[03:06:12] <Cork> as what is sent from php to js is text not memory content
[03:06:55] <Saint_Isidore> Cork ok, thank you I'll try coming up with a server side solution...googling now
[03:07:09] <JavaLover> Saint_Isidore, word of advice. There is client side & server side. Client side is what the user see's server side is the page they're grabbing content from.
[03:07:19] <Cork> O_o lol
[03:07:31] <Cork> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-4FFYD8pufc

[03:07:42] <JavaLover> For security reasons, it's best to keep the data you need Server Side, and limit what the user can see Client Side.
[03:07:43] <Cork> msi is mad XD
[03:07:59] <Saint_Isidore> JavaLover thanks, yea I'm aware of that... the line just is a little blurred to me at times :)
[03:08:03] <JavaLover> Saint_Isidore, imagine if you will there is a door between the browser & the server, you want to keep that locked.
[03:08:11] <Cork> true, it is also better to try to do the rendering in one go
[03:08:23] <Cork> and not patch it with js unless it needs to dynamically change
[03:08:28] <JavaLover> Saint_Isidore, well now that we have established you have server side & client side lets discuss this okay.
[03:08:31] <Cork> (as it change after the page has loaded)
[03:08:42] <JavaLover> Saint_Isidore, so Javascript is a client side language. It doesn't have access to Server Side variables.
[03:09:07] <JavaLover> Saint_Isidore, so what happens is the Server Side (php) or whatever you have.  Will echo it's variables such that the client can read it.
[03:09:25] <Saint_Isidore> kk
[03:09:35] <JavaLover> Saint_Isidore, but you can't change a server side variable from the client. Javascript has no access to the PHP variables.
[03:09:49] <JavaLover> Saint_Isidore, and now we reached the part of the conversation wherer we talk about $_POST and $_GET
[03:10:04] <Saint_Isidore> I know them a little
[03:10:08] <JavaLover> Saint_Isidore, when you $_POST you're supposed to be saying "I want to give you this variable" that's the whole point.
[03:10:10] <Saint_Isidore> I mean I know the dif
[03:10:27] <JavaLover> Saint_Isidore, when you $_GET you're supposed to be saying "I want to get something from the server"
[03:10:52] <Saint_Isidore> oh..never thought of it that way
[03:10:55] <JavaLover> Saint_Isidore, they both are kidna meaningless but if you keep that in mind it's good for the excorcize
[03:11:02] <Saint_Isidore> kk
[03:11:09] <JavaLover> Saint_Isidore, the point being, for PHP to get a javascript variable, you have to use $_GET or $_POST
[03:11:38] <JavaLover> Saint_Isidore, security wise I recommend thinking about it like "ohhh $_GET can come from basically anyone requesting anything, I.E. an Image request is a GET
[03:11:53] <JavaLover> Saint_Isidore, whereas $_POST has to come from someone wanting to POST something to the server.
[03:12:09] <Uhkis> Cork: at least the keyboard isn't that apple style which is very popular nowadays :D
[03:12:12] <JavaLover> Saint_Isidore, of course there are no gaurantees but ideally that's how it should work.
[03:12:28] <Saint_Isidore> JavaLover thanks, totally makes sense
[03:12:34] <JavaLover> Saint_Isidore, now when you say $_SESSION[]  that was created such that the variables remain SERVER SIDE
[03:12:39] <Cork> Uhkis: no it is a freaking mekanical brown switch keyboard XD
[03:12:47] <Saint_Isidore> JavaLover right
[03:12:50] <JavaLover> Saint_Isidore, sessions are legit only supposed to be accessable by the server.
[03:12:58] <JavaLover> Saint_Isidore, so if you want $_SESSION information you have to echo it back.
[03:13:20] <JavaLover> Saint_Isidore, however you end up doing that...so let me show you even more lets pretend you have a page myownpage.php
[03:13:28] <Saint_Isidore> kk
[03:13:28] <Cork> (and 4 ssd raid 10 disks...)
[03:13:36] <JavaLover> Saint_Isidore, and inside you have <html><body><p>hello world</p></body></html>
[03:13:41] <Saint_Isidore> kk
[03:13:48] <JavaLover> Saint_Isidore, now you go there & you go "oh hello world nice"
[03:14:01] <JavaLover> Saint_Isidore, but really what just happened was, PHP treated all of that code, as an echo
[03:14:11] <JavaLover> Saint_Isidore, atleast that's what my friends in #php told me.
[03:14:20] <JavaLover> Saint_Isidore, so that's an example of how to get anything echo'd back.
[03:14:49] <JavaLover> Saint_Isidore, so what you could do is this to see a $_SESSION variable. <html><body><p><?php echo $_SESSION['myvar'];?></p></body></html>
[03:15:05] <JavaLover> and now you see that we combined the php with the html creating one giant echo that you can read client isde.
[03:15:06] <JavaLover> side*
[03:15:30] <Saint_Isidore> so basically grab the $_SEESION['value'] set a conditional and output the html needed to select the proper radio btn
[03:15:45] <JavaLover> I mean ideally but what's important is to understand the process
[03:15:49] <JavaLover> that's far more important than the code
[03:15:55] <JavaLover> so what is happening is you go "hey server sup I need something"
[03:16:09] <JavaLover> and then your server side goes "oh what's that..you need this page? k lets run that page & give you an output"
[03:16:21] <JavaLover> SOmetimes your output is actually nothing...or it can be something.
[03:16:35] <JavaLover> <?php //all of this is nothing unless you have echo or print?>
[03:16:59] <JavaLover> <?php //but as soon as you do like;  echo 'hello world'; <--- well that's output?>
[03:17:11] <Cork> i think the base of the line is you should learn the language you want to modify
[03:17:18] <JavaLover> Saint_Isidore, so you make a call to server, the server then gives you a response back.
[03:17:21] <Cork> not just google and copy paste something random
[03:17:22] <Saint_Isidore> The trick thing is I'm modifying someone elses code with this.. they had a choice in the script that is based on a click of a radio button, I need the choice to be based on a previous selection that was made earlier on
[03:17:51] <JavaLover> Saint_Isidore, right so you can post, or "submit" the choice the user made
[03:18:00] <JavaLover> Saint_Isidore, then you can store that in a session or in a database for later use
[03:18:01] <Saint_Isidore> correct
[03:18:10] <Cork> there are other options
[03:18:18] <Saint_Isidore>  Cork  ??
[03:18:19] <JavaLover> Cork I agree you can also store client side
[03:18:27] <Cork> Saint_Isidore: what is this options about?
[03:18:33] <JavaLover> I'm just establishing so he learns client side server side relationship because honestly
[03:18:37] <Cork> for how long do you want them to survive?
[03:18:39] <JavaLover> that to me is a tough lesson everyone should learn.
[03:18:46] <Cork> ex an url param might be just as good
[03:19:01] <Cork> (as it then can differ between browser tabs)
[03:19:06] <JavaLover> true you could attach it to the url param.
[03:19:11] <JavaLover> and then submit the whole thing when done.
[03:19:43] <JavaLover> But again Saint_Isidore what i'm saying is..if you want the server to ever know what happened you have to "post" it or "submit it" or put it in as a URL param.
[03:19:50] <Saint_Isidore> couple of issue the original selection is cross domain and gets processed by a third party application
[03:20:08] <JavaLover> Saint_Isidore, well those are things you have to workout..but I think you get the idea.
[03:20:12] <Cork> Saint_Isidore: how is that content loaded?
[03:20:42] <Saint_Isidore> so adding it to the url with a param like ?product=12 is not really an option...so I placed it in a $_SESSION
[03:20:57] <JavaLover> Saint_Isidore, it could technically be an option.
[03:21:07] <JavaLover> Saint_Isidore, but if you want to store it in a session, then sure it'll be in a session.
[03:21:29] <JavaLover> Saint_Isidore, your options are all based on your goal. Perhaps explain the goal & i'll tell you what I think is best option.
[03:21:34] <Cork> JavaLover: slow down a little bit and get the full picture before suggesting solutions
[03:21:46] <JavaLover> Cork hehe I don't normally do the helping part :D
[03:21:56] <JavaLover> Got a lot of Q's :D
[03:22:03] <Saint_Isidore> http://pasteboard.co/1iRmPOR7.png
[03:22:14] <Cork> we need to understand how the parts are integrated before saying how it is best solved
[03:22:25] <Cork> i first thought it was a simpler solution then it currently looks like
[03:22:51] <Cork> Saint_Isidore: that is the rendering what i need to know is how the parts are loaded
[03:22:57] <Cork> what is cross domain?
[03:23:05] <JavaLover> maybe i'm seeing this image wrong...
[03:23:09] <JavaLover> I just see a loadbar...
[03:23:10] <Saint_Isidore> so in that image you will see 3 radio buttons.. right now you can select any one radion button and its doing two things. 1. updating the pricing table with the selected information (price...etc)and and changing the form data so when the user hits submit the correct item is charged
[03:23:31] <Saint_Isidore> it go through infusionsot
[03:23:33] <JavaLover> opening in firefox 1 sec
[03:23:35] <Saint_Isidore> infusionsoft
[03:23:43] <Cork> k
[03:23:57] <Cork> and?
[03:23:59] <JavaLover> oh I think Cork has a better solution then.
[03:24:18] <Saint_Isidore> anyway, that form shoudl not show the 3 radio buttons, I need to change that somehow, but I need to option to be based on a previous page selection
[03:24:21] <Saint_Isidore> if that makes sense
[03:24:33] <Cork> ok
[03:24:41] <JavaLover> Saint_Isidore, based on what you describe, use client side variables to store the value of the form submit.
[03:24:56] <JavaLover> Saint_Isidore, and when the user is ready, submit all information to server.
[03:25:01] <Cork> JavaLover: slow down
[03:25:06] <Saint_Isidore> JavaLover ok I have stored the selection in $_SESSION[]
[03:25:08] <JavaLover> yeah I slow down :D
[03:25:09] <Cork> Saint_Isidore: the previous page, how is it loaded?
[03:25:24] <Cork> meaning is it partial page replacement
[03:25:26] <JavaLover> Cork imma let you take the helm on this because you're amazing. BUt I said what I needed to I think :D
[03:25:30] <Cork> or are you doing full page loads?
[03:25:49] <Saint_Isidore> yes its on a seperate url...but same domain
[03:25:54] <Cork> JavaLover: you might be able to take it, but we need to get the full picture first
[03:26:03] <Saint_Isidore> and yes full page load if I understand the question properly
[03:26:36] <Cork> Saint_Isidore: and the previous page is doing a form submit?
[03:26:58] <Saint_Isidore> yes to infusionsoft, it creates a contact record
[03:27:03] <Cork> ok
[03:27:12] <Saint_Isidore> and I can only pull contact information back to the next page
[03:27:15] <JavaLover> Saint_Isidore, I can tell you what you're working on is exactly what i'm doing but i'm doing a complex one.
[03:27:22] <Saint_Isidore> I can not add product selection params
[03:27:36] <Cork> Saint_Isidore: then this is what you need to do, server side as a response to the post/get call you need to reuse that value to set the radio options in this page as php renders it
[03:27:42] <Saint_Isidore> so I stored them in a $_SESSION
[03:27:52] <Cork> you don't need $_SESSION at all
[03:27:56] <JavaLover> Saint_Isidore, precisely what cork just said.
[03:28:10] <JavaLover> and Cork he will if he wants CSRF tokens :D
[03:28:21] <Saint_Isidore> but that original form submission is on infusiosoft servers not my own
[03:28:41] <JavaLover> Saint_Isidore, wait you submit to a server you don't have access to?
[03:28:48] <Cork> Saint_Isidore: so it redirects to your scripts?
[03:28:53] <Saint_Isidore> correct thats what I'm saying
[03:28:59] <Cork> ah
[03:29:00] <Saint_Isidore> yes correct
[03:29:03] <Cork> that complicates things
[03:29:04] <JavaLover> Saint_Isidore, well it's not a problem you get a response from them.
[03:29:15] <JavaLover> Saint_Isidore, whatever the response is will help you to determine what page to display.
[03:29:18] <Saint_Isidore> they process the contact record web form and re-directs them back to my server/site
[03:29:20] <JavaLover> Saint_Isidore, so what type of responses can you get?
[03:29:47] <JavaLover> Saint_Isidore, is there only one url that it redirects to?
[03:30:02] <Saint_Isidore> With infusionsoft I have an option to pass back contact record info...but that it..name, address that sort of thing
[03:30:23] <Saint_Isidore> yes, only one "thank you" url that you may set
[03:30:24] <JavaLover> Saint_Isidore, well figure out what information you can have passed & that should help you to determine what to display.
[03:30:45] <JavaLover> Saint_Isidore, the thank you url...is that upon the purchase going through?
[03:31:12] <Saint_Isidore> well, in this case it  the redirect after completing a web form
[03:31:23] <Cork> mattias@qzdev.serXG1yqWT
[03:31:39] <Cork> mattias@qzdev.serXG1yqWT
[03:31:49] <JavaLover> Saint_Isidore, so you're submitting a web form to someone else & then getting a response correct?
[03:31:58] <Cork> mattias@qzdev.serXG1yqWT
[03:32:05] <JavaLover> Cork why the spam?
[03:32:14] <Saint_Isidore> http://pasteboard.co/1iS2pvQN.png
[03:32:25] <Cork> gah... me typing in the wrong window >_<
[03:32:42] * Cork this is going to be lovely...
[03:32:45] <Saint_Isidore> yes that is correct, the image above is the first step that simply creates a contact record and then redirects them back to my site
[03:33:02] <JavaLover> and you want to tell the user about there purchase?
[03:33:13] <Saint_Isidore> but on that page I'm setting the $_SESSION['selected_product']
[03:33:22] <JavaLover> Wait but Saint
[03:33:28] <JavaLover> you want to tell the user about what they just purchased?
[03:33:50] <Saint_Isidore> JavaLover no they have not purchase yes
[03:33:51] <Saint_Isidore> yet
[03:33:59] <Saint_Isidore> they have only completed a contact form
[03:34:09] <JavaLover> it says "where do we ship your order..."
[03:34:35] <Saint_Isidore> yup its like marketers thing..they collect contact information in case of cart abandonment
[03:34:57] <JavaLover> okayyyy so you say "sure ship it here" then that goes through & you're redirected back to your landing page?
[03:35:04] <Saint_Isidore> yes!
[03:35:08] <Saint_Isidore> ;)
[03:35:13] <JavaLover> but it's always the same page?
[03:35:21] <Saint_Isidore> but they had allready selected what product they want to buy prior
[03:35:22] <JavaLover> and you're selling multiple products?
[03:35:28] <Saint_Isidore> 3 products only
[03:35:38] <JavaLover> but those products don't matter here right?
[03:35:46] <JavaLover> like this "where do we ship your order"
[03:35:49] <JavaLover> they don't care about the product
[03:35:53] <Saint_Isidore> well that is what I have in the session variable the product they want to buy
[03:36:03] <JavaLover> I know but this is important
[03:36:06] <Saint_Isidore> correct they already decided on a product to buy
[03:36:10] <JavaLover> so you're sending like "yeah ship here" but you don't send what to ship?
[03:36:50] <Saint_Isidore> step 1. give us your shipping address
[03:36:58] <Saint_Isidore> step 2, we create a contact record
[03:37:10] <Saint_Isidore> step 3 we redirect you to the checkout page
[03:37:17] <JavaLover> oh yeah then of course session it
[03:37:19] <Saint_Isidore> step 4. you purchase
[03:37:25] <JavaLover> so before step 1 even happens
[03:37:31] <Saint_Isidore> I screwed up ... step 0, you selected your product
[03:37:33] <JavaLover> when the user selects the product they want, submit that to server & session it.
[03:37:43] <Saint_Isidore> thats correct
[03:37:51] <Saint_Isidore> thats what I'm doing up till now
[03:37:59] <JavaLover> Then do all that upon redirecting show the product that is in the cart or $_SESSION['cart'];
[03:38:18] <JavaLover> so like user fills out and submits to other site
[03:38:37] <JavaLover> they redirect back to you & you go "oh hey sup guy..oh I see you have a $_SESSION['cart']; going on lemme show you that page now.
[03:38:45] <Saint_Isidore> right!
[03:38:51] <Saint_Isidore> thats what Im doing
[03:39:00] <JavaLover> well having any issues doing that now?
[03:39:04] <JavaLover> btw you don't have to submit to test..
[03:39:08] <JavaLover> you can but like what you can do is just
[03:39:18] <JavaLover> open the url that will be redirected from the contact form.
[03:39:35] <JavaLover> I would put something like $_SESSION['transacting'] = true;
[03:40:00] <Saint_Isidore> well the problem is like I showed in that first image...the form is designed to allow the user to select from radio buttons
[03:40:10] <JavaLover> if($_SESSION['transacting'] == true){ echo "you're in transaction show order stuff here" }else{ echo "show not transacting";}
[03:40:16] <JavaLover> again that's just psuedo but a basic idea
[03:40:23] <Saint_Isidore> I want to remove them, or hide them possible and set the selected item based on the session value
[03:40:49] <JavaLover> you can also just do if(isSet($_SESSION['cart'])){//well cart not empty echo "stuff in cart page";}
[03:41:16] <JavaLover> Saint_Isidore, yeah so quick example like
[03:41:25] <Saint_Isidore> ok yea that makes sense...
[03:41:25] <JavaLover> hold on gotta grab radio button
[03:41:56] <Saint_Isidore> lol
[03:42:01] <JavaLover> okay so this thing
[03:42:09] <JavaLover>  <input type="radio" name="gender" value="male" checked> Male<br>
[03:42:16] <JavaLover> so now to combine with php you can do one of 2 things like
[03:42:36] <JavaLover>  <input type="radio" name="gender" value="<?php echo $_SESSION['cart_product'];?>" checked> Male<br>
[03:43:10] <JavaLover> or you can do like echo ' <input type="radio" name="gender" value="' . $_SESSION['cart_product'] .'" checked>';
[03:43:17] <JavaLover> depending on how you populate your html.
[03:43:21] <Saint_Isidore> http://paste.ofcode.org/32u63UStUpJsig4PkPKpV62
[03:43:29] <Saint_Isidore> thats what my php looks like now
[03:43:32] <JavaLover> Me personally I populate it using a combination of html as a rendered template
[03:43:38] <JavaLover> Which I have a link to the best one I can show you here look
[03:43:46] <JavaLover> http://chadminick.com/articles/simple-php-template-engine.html#sthash.NQ4URc6L.WLGzPcpG.dpbs
[03:43:56] <JavaLover> that one imo is amazing..but it does require a bit of knowledge of how thigns work
[03:44:15] <JavaLover> also I think Bad_Advice_Cat recommend that to me so yeah
[03:44:17] <JavaLover> he's a god in #php
[03:44:40] <JavaLover> oh i'm looking at your php it's not bad
[03:44:56] <Saint_Isidore> I wish I could take the credit...I'm just modifying it
[03:45:06] <JavaLover> well no it's not amazing either lol
[03:45:08] <Saint_Isidore> yea BAC is a php beast
[03:45:08] <JavaLover> it's just not bad lol
[03:45:20] <Saint_Isidore> oh LOL
[03:45:38] <JavaLover> sooo currently you're setting the values based on $i
[03:45:48] <Saint_Isidore> any suggestions on modifying it so the value in the session data dictates the radio selected
[03:45:56] <JavaLover> yeah
[03:45:59] <JavaLover> what you just said
[03:46:03] <JavaLover> modify it all based on everything you just said
[03:46:17] <Saint_Isidore> it doesn't even need to be a radio, as I'm not going to be displaying them
[03:46:19] <JavaLover> soo basically, you have 2 options here
[03:46:32] <JavaLover> you can say "this is the one I did for if isSet($_SESSION['cart']);
[03:46:47] <JavaLover> and then you can go "else{//do the normal one}"
[03:47:02] <JavaLover> orrr you can populate the data completely based on the session always.
[03:47:14] <JavaLover> in which case if there isn't a session, no radio button ever shows up.
[03:47:41] <Saint_Isidore> hmm that might work...thinking
[03:47:45] <JavaLover> oh if you're not displaying just do input type = "hidden"
[03:48:01] <JavaLover> can I ask you something
[03:48:06] <JavaLover> if the user can't see it..and it's in a session
[03:48:10] <JavaLover> why are you even giving that to the form?
[03:48:18] <Saint_Isidore> so right now that code I showed you is just cycling through all the product that are set up and displaying them all...in this case 3
[03:48:35] <JavaLover> yeah but you want to display what's in the cart.
[03:48:40] <Saint_Isidore> right
[03:48:44] <JavaLover> so rewrite that to just display what's in the cart.
[03:49:08] <Saint_Isidore> ok, I'm gonna go mess about with it
[03:49:11] <JavaLover> <input type = "hidden" value = "<?php echo $_SESSION['cart_product'];?>
[03:49:18] <JavaLover> start simple btw
[03:49:25] <JavaLover> and build it up keep your old code but like
[03:49:29] <JavaLover> start with just echoing what's in the cart
[03:49:36] <JavaLover> then change that to like "okay echo this as an input"
[03:49:47] <JavaLover> "okay sweet, here loop through all of the cart items"
[03:50:03] <Saint_Isidore> JavaLover thank you so very much for your time and advice..! really appreaciate it!
[03:50:16] <JavaLover> for step 2: <input type = "hidden" value = "<?php echo $_SESSION['cart_item1'];?>
[03:50:21] <JavaLover> I think you can also store an array in a session
[03:50:29] <JavaLover> so that could help...Sessions can be complex.
[03:50:50] <JavaLover> Saint_Isidore, honestly it's no problem i'm working on a complex system that does everything you're doing
[03:51:03] <JavaLover> Saint_Isidore, I joined here to ask questions myself on the best way to render the response :D
[03:51:15] <Saint_Isidore> nice ;)   I'm obviously still learning...but I'm trying hard
[03:51:20] <JavaLover> nah you get there
[03:51:28] <JavaLover> as long as there is a will there is a way
[03:51:31] <Saint_Isidore> ;)
[03:51:32] <JavaLover> But I will say this, always keep it simple
[03:51:42] <JavaLover> it can be very challenging to look at someone elses code & go "ummm @#*()$"
[03:51:53] <JavaLover> but if you just isolate what you want and get a test going you can then integrate it.
[03:52:24] <JavaLover> most of the time when coding I have a simple page output of like "yup your product is " . $_SESSION['cart_item'];
[03:52:42] <JavaLover> and then from there I go "okay lets get that working with my html"
[03:52:43] <Saint_Isidore> yeah my head spins quite a bit still looking at code trying to make sense of it all. Every time I learn something, I get reminded how little I know
[03:53:06] <JavaLover> Saint_Isidore, no it's fine just take it slow, if you can get the right session response that's basically the same thing as html
[03:53:19] <JavaLover> Saint_Isidore, to then format that into html is simply echoing back the variable inside the html.
[03:54:04] <JavaLover> <input value = "<?php echo $_SESSION['cartitem'];?>">
[03:54:06] <JavaLover> like that see
[03:54:23] <JavaLover> be sure to notice when echoing it back, you're getting it as pure print
[03:54:31] <JavaLover> so you still need the "" around the php echo.
[03:54:35] <JavaLover> Does that make sense?
[03:54:48] <Saint_Isidore> oh yea
[03:54:50] <Saint_Isidore> ;)
[03:55:00] <JavaLover> see cuz if you had like <input value = <?php echo 'hi';?>/>
[03:55:12] <JavaLover> what that would translate to is <input value = hi />
[03:55:24] <JavaLover> do you see this? it's important you can see this.
[03:55:57] <JavaLover> I wonder if we can actually codepen this hold on
[03:56:39] <Saint_Isidore> oh that would be cool
[03:58:40] <JavaLover> https://codepad.remoteinterview.io/FloatingSimpleIncludeRival
[03:58:53] <JavaLover> go there for a sec
[03:59:02] <Saint_Isidore> there
[03:59:16] <JavaLover> okay i see you
[03:59:19] <JavaLover> we can chat on there
[05:34:04] <muley> <3
[05:36:27] <halabund> On this page <http://miromannino.github.io/Justified-Gallery/options-and-events/> if you search for ‘selector’, there’s this:
[05:36:28] <halabund> '> a, > div:not(.spinner)'
[05:36:35] <halabund> What does the trailing comma after ‘a’ mean?
[05:37:02] <Cork> halabund: the same it means in normal css selectors
[05:37:17] <halabund> Cork: Sorry, I’m completely new to this and I was unable to google up the asnwer ...
[05:37:24] <muley> they're 2 separate selectors.. the comma splits them
[05:37:51] <halabund> Ah, got it … thank you
[05:38:23] <halabund> I was confused about the grouping.
[05:38:49] <Cork> halabund: the difference from normal css is that this is meant to run as a partial selector
[05:39:08] <Cork> as > a, > .something isn't valid in normal css
[05:39:18] <Cork> but it is in ex. $(this).find()
[05:39:55] <halabund> Does it mean “an ‘a’ that is a child of something”, where ‘something’ is defined by library I’m trying to use?
[05:40:04] <halabund> OK
[05:40:07] <Cork> halabund: a direct child
[05:40:27] <Cork> meaning it matches <elm><a> but not <elm><div><a>
[05:41:25] <Cork> halabund: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/Guide/CSS/Getting_started/Selectors#Information_Selectors_based_on_relationships
[05:42:02] <Cork> (i recommend reading the entirety of that page)
[05:42:02] <halabund> Thank you!
[05:42:31] <Cork> you are going to have to use css selectors A LOT if you plan to use jquery
[05:42:37] <Cork> or do web development at all
[05:44:13] <halabund> so with X Y, Y is any child and with X > Y, it is a direct one
[05:44:50] <halabund> thanks, that page clears up many things
[05:44:55] <Cork> well it is a child matching the selector, but ya at any level
[05:56:23] <laxeot> does anyone know how to prevent jquery animations from pausing (or whatever they do) when the tab is blurred (unfocused)? my animation looks like this when the page loads: https://i.gyazo.com/7e4a72d231f9bd5f462c192ac3a0cfc1.gif but after i switch tabs and come back, it looks like this: https://i.gyazo.com/b3ac23dcf0640407697194f2a8505c62.gif
[05:57:07] <Cork> laxeot: don't combine animations with setTimeout/setInterval
[05:57:20] <Cork> laxeot: animateions should use a reference to when they where triggered
[05:57:43] <Cork> if you write your animation code correctly you wouldn't require the user to be able to fire an animation exactly every x ms
[05:57:58] <Cork> (it is really horribly bad for user experience, ex battery life)
[05:58:02] <laxeot> how else would i achieve infinite animation?
[05:58:13] <laxeot> or, is this a bad choice in general
[05:58:15] <Cork> you could use requestAnimationFrame
[05:58:22] <Cork> grab a start timestamp
[05:58:29] <Cork> check the timestamp you get in the callback
[05:58:37] <Cork> and calculate what step you should be at from that
[05:58:48] <laxeot> oh hmm, okay! i'll try that, thanks
[05:58:49] <Cork> then if you got a 2h between two animations it wouldn't matter
[05:58:59] <laxeot> riiiight, okay. thank you!
[06:01:24] <fn> any idea why line 14 doesn't work? http://pastie.org/10857848
[06:02:31] <Cork> fn: cause you convert a jquery object into an array of dom elements
[06:02:39] <Cork> and Array doens't have a .addClass
[06:02:53] <fn> oh
[06:02:59] <Cork> change this.slides = [].slice.call( this.handle.children() );
[06:03:04] <Cork> to this.slides = this.handle.children();
[06:03:07] <Cork> and you should be good
[06:03:17] <Cork> opps
[06:03:27] <Cork> and [this.current] to .eq(this.current)
[06:03:57] <fn> thanks!
[06:04:05] <fn> didn't recognize it
[06:04:19] <fn> try to re-write non jquery code to jquery for better usage :D
[06:21:44] <laxeot> Cork, this is my current idea to keep animations from pausing on blur, does this sound right?: each frame, the frame number is put into a variable. when the page is blurred, the animation probably continues or whatever. when the page is refocused, it jumps back to the frame of when it was blurred
[06:31:53] <DreamStiffler> Hi, im trying to set the maxWidth according to the containing div. How do this? Or  where do i set the function so i can replace the value of maxWidth? https://api.jqueryui.com/resizable/#option-maxWidth
[06:32:35] <DreamStiffler> In the link given, theres only way to insert the width manually. I would like insert something based on the container
[06:32:49] <DreamStiffler> Cork: U there my hero?
[06:34:00] <DreamStiffler> I tried putting a function im the resize option and get the containing divs size, but im not sure how to put it back to the maxWidth
[06:34:38] <DreamStiffler> *in the resize: option
[06:40:06] <laxeot> i've tried using requestAnimationFrame to handle animation looping instead of setInterval/setTimeout, but the animation falls out of sync really quickly. what am i doing wrong? https://jsfiddle.net/w3w695ck/2/
[06:48:15] <laxeot> my problem is that i have no idea how to use requestAnimationFrame to handle jQuery animations in place of setInterval.
[07:00:40] <DreamStiffler> https://jsfiddle.net/utmpLhed/
[07:04:42] <DreamStiffler> https://api.jqueryui.com/resizable/#method-option
[07:04:45] <DreamStiffler> help pls
[07:09:40] <Cork> laxeot: an alternative is to use the step callback from animate
[07:10:12] <Cork> laxeot: jquery uses requestAnimationFrame in the background
[07:10:23] <Cork> and that is why you get the problem you're seeing
[07:30:01] <ales> help someone please! http://pastie.org/10857918 help
[07:30:57] <taplar> what's wrong?
[07:37:49] <ales> taplar i get http://imgur.com/dfzGWEO
[07:38:18] <taplar> that doesn't help me identify the problem
[07:38:22] <taplar> and two things
[07:38:34] <taplar> you got php mixed with js, it's better if we can see the produced logic
[07:38:43] <taplar> and also this looks like underscore logic, not jquery logic
[07:39:15] <Cork> taplar: you have problem with you live php parser huh? :D
[07:39:36] <taplar> no, i just dunno what the heck it's producing, :/
[07:39:48] <Cork> ya true ^^'
[07:40:24] <taplar> hmm, there's not an underscore channel
[07:40:50] <Cork> underscore should be find as long as the rest is explained
[07:41:09] <Cork> all he does with it is shuffle
[07:41:28] <taplar> yeah, so ales, print out what your getting from that eco
[07:41:30] <taplar> *echo
[07:41:41] <ales> (mysqli_result)#3 (5) { ["current_field"]=> int(0) ["field_count"]=> int(1) ["lengths"]=> NULL ["num_rows"]=> int(1) ["type"]=> int(0) }
[07:41:41] <Uhkis> echo.. echo..
[07:41:44] <ales> i dump it..
[07:41:45] <ales> and this..?
[07:41:49] <ales> i dont expect this whats wrong?
[07:42:15] <taplar> that's the results of the json_encode?
[07:42:44] <Cork> ales: that is php
[07:42:49] <ales> i know cork......
[07:42:53] <Cork> ales: underscore runs in the browser
[07:42:56] <taplar> json_encode should return just a string
[07:43:00] <Cork> you can't dump in php and see what underscore does
[07:43:05] <ales> this is example..
[07:43:11] <ales> help me fix
[07:43:30] <Cork> ales: you need to provide a none php dependent example
[07:43:39] <Cork> ales: try and see if you can reproduce the problem in jsfiddle.net
[07:43:50] <Cork> then we have a starting point to help you
[07:43:57] <ales> its php error not js lol.
[07:44:06] <Cork> then you're asking in the wrong channel
[07:44:06] <taplar> so ##php
[07:44:10] <Cork> ya
[07:44:14] <ales> when i dump $result var i dont get expected data
[07:44:17] <ales> not allowed there..lol
[07:44:32] <Cork> ...
[07:44:38] <taplar> doesn't change the subject of this channel
[07:45:19] <taplar> fwiw though, i don't believe you can go straight from a mysql result to json_encode
[07:45:27] <taplar> you have to loop and put what you want in an array
[07:45:32] <Cork> you can
[07:45:34] <taplar> oh?
[07:45:44] <Cork> depending on what api you use in php
[07:45:49] <taplar> gotcha
[07:46:08] <Cork> there are apis that gives you assosiated arrays (i think that was the name in php)
[07:46:16] <taplar> yah
[07:46:20] <Cork> and those can be feeded straght to json_encode
[07:47:19] <taplar> http://php.net/manual/en/mysqli-stmt.get-result.php
[07:47:19] <ciss> hi, can jquery collections be modified directly (without having to reassign them after e.g. adding elements)?
[07:47:34] <Cork> ciss: no
[07:47:59] <Neuromancer> ales, just a guess, maybe u need to pass true to second arg of json_encode?
[07:48:01] <Cork> ciss: you do org_variable = org_variable.add(new_data)
[07:48:10] <Uhkis> hi ciss :D
[07:50:31] <ciss> Cork: yup, that's what i'm using. thought there might be another short to better deal with collections inside closures. nothing i couldn't work around though. thanks.
[07:50:36] <ciss> Uhkis: o/ :)
[07:51:08] <ciss> *be a shorter way to better ...
[07:51:19] <Cork> ciss: you could possibly do org_variable.push(element), but i'm not sure it is safe to do so
[07:51:33] <Cork> i know .pop isn't
[07:51:46] <taplar> too much sugar
[07:52:15] <ales> GUYS I FIXED IT
[07:52:23] <taplar> cool
[07:52:58] <ales> I HAD THIS $RESULT -> $STMT->GET_RESULT(); I REPLACED WITH $result = $stmt->get_result()->fetch_assoc();
[07:53:51] <ciss> Cork: that's some useful info, thanks :)
[07:54:17] <ciss> ales: now all that's left is to get capslock unstuck ;)
[08:52:06] <hellyeah> hey
[08:52:24] <AwkwardCough> hola
[08:52:37] <hellyeah> is there a way to understand days in the current month is fully selected or not?
[08:53:01] <hellyeah> is there something to check this in api or do i need to write custom logic?
[08:53:43] <hellyeah> hope my question is understandable.
[08:54:39] <arc_> are you asking if it's possible to test if the whole month is selected
[08:54:54] <hellyeah> yes
[08:55:15] <hellyeah> i have from and to in my original example i am selecting dates
[08:55:19] <arc_> i have no idea, but i just figured i would ask in case someone who does know appears
[08:55:32] <hellyeah> in the next datepicker i created, those range of date is disabled
[08:55:51] <hellyeah> if all dates are disabled i want to show next month automatically
[08:55:56] <hellyeah> this is my scenerio
[08:56:09] <hellyeah> arc_:  thanks for the help
[08:56:38] * hellyeah clarification
[08:57:28] <AwkwardCough> what determines a disabled date?
[08:57:59] <hellyeah> for example i have .from and .to
[08:58:20] <hellyeah> i choose 2 may from "from" and 10 may from "to"
[08:58:31] <hellyeah> that means 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10 are disabled
[08:58:44] <hellyeah> your date selection determines disabled date
[08:59:14] <hellyeah> let me show you my example
[08:59:25] <hellyeah> you dont need to read code just create datepickers with +
[08:59:39] <hellyeah> and select two dates https://jsfiddle.net/hellyeah/m03hfqqd/ code is long but forget about it
[09:00:12] <taplar> http://api.jqueryui.com/datepicker/#option-beforeShowDay
[09:01:28] <hellyeah> taplar:  i used beforeshowday for disabling dates can i use same thing for checking or dates are disabled?
[09:01:44] <hellyeah> hmm
[09:01:47] <taplar> huh?
[09:01:59] <taplar> a user can't select a disabled date
[09:02:08] <hellyeah> no no you got me wrong
[09:02:18] <hellyeah> for example may is 31 days right
[09:02:35] <hellyeah> and after user selection, all days are disabled
[09:02:51] <hellyeah> user chose 1 may and 31 may it disabled all days in the month
[09:03:08] <taplar> sure
[09:03:09] <hellyeah> when user create new datepicker i want to move calendar to next month in that case
[09:03:20] <hellyeah> or
[09:03:25] <taplar> so set the starting date to your end date +1 day
[09:03:51] <arc_> he wants to know if he has to write logic to test if the whole month is selected
[09:03:56] <hellyeah> actually i kinda did that
[09:04:02] <arc_> it looks like he does have to
[09:04:06] <hellyeah> but this can be the case also imagine we are in june
[09:04:15] <taplar> dunno why you'd have to calculate a whole month
[09:04:19] <hellyeah> user select june 20 and july 5
[09:04:32] <hellyeah> next calendar will show june 6
[09:04:44] <hellyeah> but there is still selectable day in june
[09:04:51] <taplar> sure
[09:04:56] <taplar> it's a range check
[09:05:12] <hellyeah> okey in that case i want to show june instead of july
[09:05:17] <taplar> is date between x and y?  disable it
[09:05:30] <hellyeah> but if all dates in june i want to show july
[09:05:35] <hellyeah> this is some kind of check
[09:05:43] <taplar> your making this sound harder than it is
[09:05:52] <hellyeah> as usual
[09:05:57] <hellyeah> :)
[09:06:03] <taplar> you got a starting date x, and and ending date y.  if a new date is inbetween x and y, it's disabled
[09:06:11] <taplar> next calender, start on y + 1 day
[09:06:20] <taplar> what's confusing about that?
[09:06:21] <hellyeah> yes it is already done
[09:06:36] <hellyeah> pls click one datepicker and select 31 may and 5 june
[09:06:48] <hellyeah> it will show june calendar to you
[09:06:58] <taplar> right...
[09:07:13] <hellyeah> okey but may 30 is still selectable and you can choose it
[09:07:23] <taplar> right...
[09:07:26] <hellyeah> so may should be shown instead of july
[09:07:30] <hellyeah> june*
[09:07:44] <taplar> i thought you said you wanted to default to the last day + 1 ?
[09:08:24] <hellyeah> hmm i just want to check all dates in current month are disabled
[09:08:28] <hellyeah> or not disabled
[09:08:52] <hellyeah> may be i need to clarify my mind
[09:09:06] <hellyeah> do i look confused?
[09:09:18] <taplar> what your saying, if i'm understanding you, is that if they select a date range and then create a new calendar
[09:09:31] <taplar> then you want that calendar to start with the preceeding month if it's not fully used up
[09:10:40] <hellyeah> yes
[09:11:02] <taplar> that seem a little strange.  wouldn't you typically go forward when planning date ranges?
[09:11:15] <hellyeah> hmm
[09:11:48] <hellyeah> user like to see all selectable dates in current month in case if there is dates they can select right
[09:12:04] <taplar> not necessarily
[09:12:07] <hellyeah> hmm
[09:12:20] <hellyeah> well it can be an option
[09:12:30] <taplar> if you give me june, and i choose june 20-31 and then create another calendar, i'm probably going to want to do something in a future date
[09:12:37] <taplar> otherwise I would have selected the earlier june dates first
[09:12:39] <hellyeah> in my current design the principle you described was applied
[09:12:59] <hellyeah> sure
[09:13:08] <hellyeah> this is the thing make sense
[09:13:24] <taplar> and if i did mess up and i want earlier dates, i can always arrow back
[09:13:24] <hellyeah> but still i am thinking about that seems a bug
[09:13:36] <hellyeah> taplar:  correct
[09:13:44] <taplar> so what's the problem?
[09:14:05] <hellyeah> can ii be honest?
[09:14:23] <hellyeah> my managet puts an obstacle about getting my frontend to testing phase
[09:14:25] <taplar> by asking that you make it suspect as to when your not
[09:14:28] <taplar> ;)
[09:14:39] <hellyeah> i dont want to give any reason to him
[09:14:55] <taplar> huh?
[09:15:15] <hellyeah> he wants something that is kinda weird
[09:15:52] <hellyeah> anyway
[09:16:31] <hellyeah> what i understand it this is not really logical
[09:16:42] <taplar> logical, sure
[09:16:48] <taplar> expected user interface, no
[09:17:07] <taplar> people typically go forward with dates
[09:17:19] <hellyeah> i am with this concern
[09:17:30] <taplar> unless someone else here with more ui/ux experience corrects me
[09:17:32] <hellyeah> but this is a big company people can do silly things
[09:17:43] <hellyeah> i gave an option to remove spesific range of dates too
[09:18:04] <hellyeah> when you create datespicker you will see pencil button
[09:18:10] <taplar> and you are stopping date ranges from overlapping, right?
[09:18:11] <hellyeah> you can remove spesific dates
[09:18:30] <hellyeah> yes
[09:18:33] <hellyeah> well
[09:18:44] <hellyeah> there is one condition i need to maintain
[09:19:08] <hellyeah> it is like if you select 15 june and 25 june then try to 12 june 27 june that is not gonna happen
[09:19:17] <hellyeah> overlapping will not be allowed
[09:19:22] <taplar> that's what i was asking, cool
[09:19:22] <hellyeah> if it is what you meant
[09:19:36] <hellyeah> i couldnt do this yet
[09:19:58] <hellyeah> there is only two things i need to do
[09:20:20] <hellyeah> but i have an idea for overlapping issue
[09:21:00] <hellyeah> i can get from and to dates and put them into array like json array
[09:21:10] <hellyeah> and check in the next level by looping this
[09:21:30] <hellyeah> like if start < dates and dates > end
[09:21:45] <hellyeah> tell it is not possible to select this date ranges
[09:22:01] <taplar> sure
[09:22:29] <taplar> start <= dates <= end
[09:23:19] <taplar> brb
[10:58:17] <jerit> my jquery ui datepicker isn't working well with MDL... http://codepen.io/loganyoungsoftware/pen/MeWLgm
[11:11:52] <jerit> my jquery ui datepicker isn't working well with MDL... http://codepen.io/loganyoungsoftware/pen/MeWLgm ... something is removing MDL's "is-dirty" class from the input which makes the label appear above the input and I'm not sure how to put it back
[11:14:20] <kilianv> Hi everyone, i have a situation where i have a contained draggable (1) inside a div (together with a bunch of other elements) and that div itself  is draggable via a handler (2). The drag events of #1 are also applied to #2. How can I prevent this from happening?
[11:16:16] <taplar> jerit: http://codepen.io/anon/pen/GqRzZK
[11:26:27] <jerit> taplar, thanks :)
[11:33:01] <D-rex> kilianv: create a fiddle of what you have
[11:33:37] <kilianv> @D-rex i'll try. It's quite an involved system that i encounter this in :/
[11:42:51] <kilianv> @D-rex here you go: https://jsfiddle.net/y45zm240/
[11:43:00] <kilianv> (it turned out to be simple)
[11:43:28] <kilianv> @D-rex if you open the console, you see that if you drag the thumb, "drag" on .outerdiv is also called.
[11:46:44] <D-rex> kilianv: https://jsfiddle.net/cercos/y45zm240/2/
[11:47:12] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/y45zm240/3/
[11:47:41] <taplar> yours is smaller, :)
[11:52:32] <kilianv> Thanks guys :) The code I have does have drag functions though (but bound later), but it definitely behaves differently. Thanks for the help though, i'll see what happens when i have drag functions right away :)
[12:09:35] <DreamStiffler> hi guys. Im trying to console log something...and it returned : [object HTMLCollection]
[12:09:41] <DreamStiffler> how do i view this?
[12:09:48] <robertmaxrees> what are you logging?
[12:10:08] <DreamStiffler> robertmaxrees: list of divs
[12:10:22] <robertmaxrees> what's the actual console.log() call, i mean.
[12:10:27] <robertmaxrees> are you trying to add a string or something to it?
[12:10:42] <DreamStiffler> robertmaxrees: i just want to see if im getting the right thing that i want
[12:10:49] <DreamStiffler> robertmaxrees: hod on
[12:10:55] <DreamStiffler> robertmaxrees: hold on
[12:12:54] <DreamStiffler> robertmaxrees: var xMan = document.getElementById(someId).getElementsByClassName("someClassName"); console.log(xMan);
[12:14:01] <DreamStiffler> i tried .html and .text doesnt work. Should i have a . before someClassName?
[12:14:08] <robertmaxrees> slow down :)
[12:14:16] <robertmaxrees> first off - you're using native JS :)
[12:14:33] <DreamStiffler> robertmaxrees: yes i mix and match coz i sucked
[12:14:40] <DreamStiffler> robertmaxrees: *suck
[12:14:57] <robertmaxrees> nah, you don't.  but that's a really important point :) seconf off - what def tools are you using?
[12:15:08] <robertmaxrees> because ff and chrome both show you the elements.
[12:15:29] <DreamStiffler> robertmaxrees: def tools? dev tools u mean? chrome sir
[12:15:34] <DreamStiffler> robertmaxrees: mam
[12:15:35] <robertmaxrees> yeah sorry.
[12:15:39] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[12:15:47] <robertmaxrees> either way, chrome shows you pretty clearly what's up.
[12:16:15] <robertmaxrees> see that little arrow next to "HTMLCollection[n]"?
[12:17:46] <DreamStiffler> robertmaxrees: what little arrow? im viewing this in f12 console. it returns : kakipi :[object HTMLCollection]
[12:17:53] <DreamStiffler> kakipi is a random marker for my logs
[12:17:59] <robertmaxrees> that's your problem.
[12:18:03] <robertmaxrees> drop that "market".
[12:18:06] <robertmaxrees> *marker
[12:18:21] <robertmaxrees> javascript is trying to coerce it into a string.  that's what's causing your problem.
[12:19:04] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/a1Lqt4n6/ notice how it works correctly here?
[12:19:13] <DreamStiffler> robertmaxrees: so instead of : console.log("kakipi :" + xMan); i should do console.log(xMan); ???
[12:19:17] <robertmaxrees> yes.
[12:19:26] <robertmaxrees> look at the fiddle i just sent and check out your console.
[12:19:29] <robertmaxrees> notice how it works?
[12:20:10] <DreamStiffler> robertmaxrees: ok hold on
[12:20:18] <DreamStiffler> robertmaxrees: lemme try in mine
[12:22:46] <DreamStiffler> robertmaxrees: great it returns the arrows. thanks but i have no idea what these are.
[12:22:53] <robertmaxrees> click the arrow.
[12:22:59] <robertmaxrees> it'll expand.
[12:23:06] <robertmaxrees> then you can hover over each entry.
[12:23:12] <robertmaxrees> should hightlight on the page.
[12:23:15] <robertmaxrees> you can explore from there.
[12:24:33] <DreamStiffler> robertmaxrees: thanks mate/maam
[12:24:45] <robertmaxrees> why do you keep referring to me that way?
[12:28:58] <taplar> maybe he thinks you could be a roberta
[12:29:04] <robertmaxrees> i guess?
[12:30:11] <sir_robertmaxree> no confusion
[12:30:17] <robertmaxrees> hahahaha
[12:30:20] <DjBonadoobie> lol
[12:30:21] <taplar> oh, chopped of an s
[12:31:02] <taplar> at least you don't get called 'mam' sometimes on the phone.  *me broods*
[12:31:17] <robertmaxrees> ouch.
[12:31:34] <taplar> hasn't happened in a while, but the other day when i was calling the util places, one did that, lol
[12:31:59] <taplar> then you lower your voice a bit and see how much they stick to their guns
[12:32:52] <taplar> i think some call centers have people who are like, "oh, this person is being polite.  must be a chick"
[12:33:23] <robertmaxrees> hahahahaha
[12:33:32] <robertmaxrees> pretty sure our reps aren't like that, but i wouldn't be surprised.
[12:46:19] <unisex_taplar> it's a trap!
[12:46:25] <taplar> yeah, i went there
[12:47:36] * taplar notes it was a memorial day when he was kicked from jquery for over sharing
[12:47:43] <robertmaxrees> hahahaha
[12:50:33] <Uhkis> what? :D
[12:51:00] <taplar> apparently Uhkis thinks i'm under sharing
[12:51:41] <Uhkis> no, im googling memorial day
[12:52:01] <taplar> oh, it's the us's holiday to celebrate veterans
[12:52:18] <robertmaxrees> that's veteran's day.
[12:52:25] <DjBonadoobie> >.>
[12:52:27] <taplar> don't ruin my dreams
[12:52:32] <taplar> hmm
[12:52:32] <robertmaxrees> memorial day is for those who made the ultimate sacrifice.
[12:53:15] <Uhkis> hmm, it's today?
[12:53:17] <taplar> ahh, phsss, i'm not gonna discriminate like that
[12:53:23] <robertmaxrees> memorial day is, yeah.
[12:53:30] <taplar> they get two days with me, :D
[12:53:44] <robertmaxrees> roughly corresponds with the signing of the treaty of versailles
[12:54:32] <robertmaxrees> also decoration day iirc.
[12:54:40] * taplar isn't well with the grammer and the history
[12:54:45] <decx> so you only get days off for military propaganda then
[12:54:51] <Uhkis> robertmaxrees: who should i talk to get more ops for the europes morning shift
[12:54:53] <robertmaxrees> decx not at all.
[12:55:04] <robertmaxrees> decx i don't even get today off.
[12:55:11] <taplar> <-- not me either
[12:55:14] <decx> oh?
[12:55:29] <robertmaxrees> decx federal holidays aren't mandated to be taken off by people in the US.
[12:55:39] <decx> protestant work ethic eh
[12:55:41] <decx> what a scam
[12:55:44] <robertmaxrees> lol
[12:55:58] <robertmaxrees> i honestly don't mind.  it's usually a day to catch up and take care of things I want to do .
[12:56:03] <taplar> when you work in retail, you work with the stores are open
[12:56:08] <robertmaxrees> ^
[12:56:08] <taplar> with = when
[12:56:30] <taplar> doesn't mean people are happy with it though, :)
[12:56:32] <robertmaxrees> plus (at least in CA) they can't give some of us the day off and not others.
[12:57:26] <AwkwardCough> i believe that is most states
[12:57:32] <robertmaxrees> wouldn't be surprised.
[12:57:38] <taplar> ^ is also having to work
[12:57:52] <robertmaxrees> since we have an in-house call center, we have some weird stuff about holidays and vacation and sick pay and stuff.
[12:57:52] <decx> holidays in germany: http://i.imgur.com/yYvgPJE.jpg blue: what's a holiday, yellow: we get christmas and easter off yo, red: jesus might have done SOMETHING better take the day off
[12:58:12] <robertmaxrees> hahahahahaha
[12:58:14] <taplar> well i say 'work', but he's doing a load testing tool.  so not really working, right awkward?
[12:58:34] <AwkwardCough> :[
[12:58:37] <robertmaxrees> a have a buddy that works for a british-owned company that gets all british holidays and lots of amercan holidays off.
[12:58:43] <taplar> i was really expecting to get an evil eye over that one
[12:58:55] <taplar> ohhh!  does he work for an airplane company?
[12:59:03] <robertmaxrees> nah
[12:59:09] <robertmaxrees> call analytics.
[12:59:26] <AwkwardCough> call analytics what?
[12:59:57] <robertmaxrees> that's what they do :)
[13:00:03] <taplar> my roommate works for some airplane manufacture that is based out of britian or some where.  they take a month off i think he was saying at some point
[13:00:51] <taplar> Dassault
[13:00:56] <Uhkis> out of what
[13:01:08] <robertmaxrees> britain
[13:01:20] <robertmaxrees> AwkwardCough https://www.iovox.com/ - this is the company.
[13:01:47] * taplar also doesn't do geography
[13:02:03] <AwkwardCough> ah, i was making a joke before
[13:02:17] <taplar> no, no you weren't
[13:02:23] <taplar> come on evil eye
[13:02:50] * AwkwardCough sighs
[13:03:23] <taplar> now i just feel like a douche
[13:04:29] <taplar> lol, i have a follow up, but i'm hesitant.
[13:04:39] <AwkwardCough> go for it
[13:04:47] <taplar> it's good to be clean
[13:05:11] * AwkwardCough 
[13:05:31] <taplar> i mean alpine fresh!
[13:06:00] * taplar wanders back to his git merge hell
[13:20:51] <shakil> hello
[13:20:59] <robertmaxrees> good morning.
[13:21:10] <shakil> good morning robertmaxrees
[13:21:28] <shakil> i'm displaying a music player in a tab
[13:22:00] <shakil> so when the music player tab is clicked. the player looks all disorted
[13:22:05] <shakil> but when i resize the window once
[13:22:08] <shakil> it all gets fixed
[13:22:38] <shakil> what can i do to 'refresh' the music player like window.resize event on mouselick?
[13:22:44] <shakil> mouseclick *
[13:22:44] <shakil> :D
[13:23:00] <robertmaxrees> i'd find out why it's getting distorted and fix that instead.
[13:24:23] <shakil> i'm guessing that the player gets its window width from its holding div. since it's a tabbed div. the holding div has very little width in its hidden mode. and when it's clicked and appear, the music player does not update the width until an event occurs
[13:24:52] <robertmaxrees> so then measure the width of the parent tabbed container and set it.
[13:25:11] <robertmaxrees> firing the window resize event is a little heavy-handed.
[13:26:07] <shakil> and when the page loads with that tab open. everything is fine. it happens only when the page loads with any other tab open and that music tab hidden
[13:26:21] <robertmaxrees> yeah, sounds like you need to fix the init.
[13:27:33] <shakil> any hint?
[13:27:57] <robertmaxrees> how do you set the width of the player?
[13:28:00] <robertmaxrees> or is that handled for you?
[13:28:34] <shakil> automatically handled
[13:28:41] <robertmaxrees> hrmmm.
[13:28:47] <robertmaxrees> what's the player?
[13:28:57] <robertmaxrees> maybe the documentation has something.
[13:29:12] <shakil> smartpodcastplayer
[13:29:31] <shakil> documentation didn't mention such cases :p
[13:29:35] <robertmaxrees> woah they charge for this:
[13:29:36] <robertmaxrees> ?
[13:30:15] <robertmaxrees> I'd report this as a bug to them, then,
[13:30:53] <shakil> yeah
[13:30:56] <shakil> monthly
[13:31:04] <shakil> $12/month
[13:31:07] <robertmaxrees> yeah, notify them.
[13:31:34] <taplar> A player as smart as your podcast
[13:31:36] <shakil> do you think I should try any other tab plugin?
[13:31:50] <robertmaxrees> i think the player has a bug that you need to report.
[13:34:12] <shakil> for now, is there any way to 'refresh' that div on a mouseclick?
[13:34:39] <shakil> anything equivalent to window resize
[13:34:42] <robertmaxrees> i'd use that tech support you're paying for.
[13:34:48] <robertmaxrees> and check that first.
[13:35:10] <shakil> okay. seeing if they have live chat support
[13:35:27] <robertmaxrees> or just email them or whatever options they give you.
[13:35:52] <robertmaxrees> i suggest that because any fixes I suggest could run counter to what they might have you do.
[13:35:56] <robertmaxrees> they might even have a solution for you already.
[14:17:30] <taplar> A mayor was having trouble with an increase of violence in his city.  He reached out to the governor to see if he had any advice on how to resolve the situation.
[14:17:43] <taplar> To which the governor replied, "Use the (police) force!"
[14:34:02] <Diplomat> Hey guys, can anyone help me out please. I'm trying to get all table cells besides the first cell of the row (I have multiple rows)
[14:34:04] <Diplomat> Any ideas?
[14:34:26] <robertmaxrees> show us your code.
[14:34:28] <Diplomat> Right now I have $('tr td:gt(0)'), but it applies only to the first row's first cell
[14:34:28] <robertmaxrees> in a jsfiddle.
[14:35:00] <mmmveggies> 'tr td:not(:first-of-type)'
[14:35:29] <robertmaxrees> or use .filter()
[14:38:37] <taplar> slice it
[14:38:51] <taplar> mmm, could be multiple rows, nvm
[14:38:52] <robertmaxrees> or that.
[14:39:13] <Diplomat> mmveggies: Woo
[14:39:16] <Diplomat> nto works
[14:39:22] <Diplomat> $('#editable td').not('.noedit')
[14:39:25] <Diplomat> Thank you!
[14:39:39] <robertmaxrees> that's why i ask for fiddles haha
[14:45:15] <lalalaaa> Hi! Is there a way to make this more readable? https://jsfiddle.net/mark909/x1ak4L7c/ -- drop tables perhaps? Or use some fancy JS lib?
[14:45:55] <taplar> i don't see any js...
[14:46:11] <DjBonadoobie> ^
[14:46:17] <mmmveggies> do you *have* to use a table? I don't know what any of that says but tables end up restricting you a lot
[14:49:37] <taplar> yeah, i dunno what this table says, but just looking at the varying columns that are filled out between each row, i get the feeling that it might be better to break them out into their own sections
[14:49:53] <lalalaaa> taplar: I meant if I were to use JS
[14:50:02] <lalalaaa> No, I don't really have to use a table
[14:50:05] <taplar> why use js when you have static content?
[14:50:18] <lalalaaa> sections ok
[14:50:34] <lalalaaa> taplar: true
[14:51:23] <taplar> or if you just have a bug in your shorts to do something fancy...
[14:51:44] <taplar> http://jqueryui.com/accordion/
[14:51:59] <lalalaaa> taplar: table covers all of norwegian history btw
[14:52:26] <taplar> me and history have an agreement.  it leaves me alone, i forget it exists
[14:52:34] <lalalaaa> taplar: haha
[14:52:41] <lalalaaa> nice one
[14:52:59] <taplar> but if you wanted you could do a vertical accordion per what you have now as a 'row'
[14:53:12] <taplar> would compact it a bit

[15:01:24] <taplar> same
[15:15:28] <glowdemon1> http://paste.ofcode.org/6ES7VtXjzimvYAdy8vntYF - Whats the best way to select 'spoiler-content' when the 'spoiler' button is clicked?
[15:16:07] <glowdemon1> $(this).closest('.jumbotron').find('.spoiler-content'); is what I have right now, but it doesn't feel right
[15:16:34] <robertmaxrees> are you trying to get the spoiler-content within the current .jumbotron?
[15:17:19] <robertmaxrees> glowdemon1
[15:17:26] <glowdemon1> Yes
[15:17:30] <robertmaxrees> then that's how you do it.
[15:17:53] <glowdemon1> Alrighty, thanks though
[15:18:09] <robertmaxrees> yeah.
[16:21:55] <krambiorix> hi guys, i have a textarea with text in it like <textarea>my awesome text</textarea> . I init tinymce on it but my text is gone... How can i do this?

[18:37:05] <dw1> *some things not others
[18:39:08] <Diplomat> Hey guys, does anyone know how to trigger a click on table cell? I have tried click and trigger methods, but they don't seem to work
[19:21:01] <martin290> hey everyone
[19:21:11] <martin290> can i get some help with something really silly i'm trying to do?
[19:21:30] <martin290> i have a very simple html page and i just want to set a value to an input textbox but i can't seem to do it
[19:22:29] <martin290> 1 sec ill paste my code
[19:24:50] <martin290> http://pastebin.com/0yP9rnr0
[19:26:52] <Diplomat> Change
[19:26:57] <Diplomat> }; to });
[19:28:35] <martin290> Diplomat: that was definitely one of the issues... i just change that, but it still isn't working :(
[19:29:54] <Diplomat> martin290: could be because of that "async" in your script tag
[19:29:58] <Diplomat> remove it and then it works
[19:30:39] <martin290> Diplomat: ah, you're 100% right!
[19:31:03] <Sal> hi
[19:31:16] <Diplomat> Basically that async will run as soon as it can, but your bottom code executes first
[19:31:29] <Sal> can someone help me make these sticky headers stick at top:100px instead of top: 0 ?   https://codepen.io/chrissp26/pen/gBrdo
[19:31:29] <martin290> Diplomat: ahhhh ok
[19:31:46] <martin290> Diplomat: thanks for your help!!
[19:31:51] <Diplomat> I'd put jquery's script tag to footer too if you don't want to block the browser, but it doesn't matter much usually
[19:31:52] <Diplomat> np
[19:32:40] <martin290> alright, i'll do that
[19:32:58] <Diplomat> Sal: add margin-top: 100px; to .followMeBar.fixed ?
[19:33:14] <Sal> no, i tied that
[19:33:22] <Diplomat> martin290: http://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_script_async.asp
[19:33:38] <Sal> the control on when to add the classes and when to remove them is based on that position
[19:34:43] <Sal> also, i tried to change $thisSticky.addClass("fixed").css('top', 0);
[19:34:55] <Sal> but its not getting the top, it only changes class
[19:34:57] <Sal> strange
[19:35:24] <martin290> Diplomat: when would be a time you'd use async? i thought it was used to help performance
[19:36:47] <Diplomat> I build stuff that doesn't need those few milliseconds :P so I can't help you with that. I have never used async.. no need for that
[19:37:18] <martin290> Diplomat: that answers my question, thanks
[19:37:24] <martin290> :)
[19:38:37] <Diplomat> jquery is well made so i wouldnt use it with jquery, but i'd use it with some really heavy instant activated scripts that could affect rendering or something.. but as I said, I haven't used it and I'm sure here are people who could explain it better and give better examples
[19:40:19] <_f_oo> If my site is example.com, and I do a $.get request to google.com, do google.com cookies in my browser automatically get sent with the request? (I don't care about example.com cookies, only existing google.com cookies)
[19:40:31] <martin290> well if you haven't had a reason to use it, more than likely, i'm not going to use it either
[19:41:21] <Diplomat> To be honest, I have never seen anyone using async with jquery too.. so I'd assume there's no need for it :)
[19:41:56] <martin290> :) if i want to tie a button to a click event, i do this, right: $("#search").click({
[19:41:56] <martin290>            alert("Hey there!");
[19:41:56] <martin290>         });
[19:42:10] <martin290> provided the id of the button is "search"
[19:42:49] <Diplomat> _f_oo: you cant do that
[19:42:52] <D-rex> sal change your .fixed class to have top:100px and change line 33 to if ($stickyPosition <= $window.scrollTop() + 100)
[19:43:01] <martin290> wait, nevermind, i forgot to add function() to the front of it
[19:43:27] <Sal> D-rex. i'm trying to do it using a variable
[19:43:59] <_f_oo> Diplomat, sorry what do you mean? I thought cookies were always sent with every HTTP request?
[19:44:16] <Sal> i'm taking top:0; out of the css, and i'm trying to add a css('top', '100px') after the addClass('fixed')
[19:44:21] <Sal> with no luck
[19:44:25] <Sal> and don't know why
[19:44:34] <Diplomat> _f_oo: that's because of the cross origin issue.. it wont allow you as long as it's not sending one specific header back, i think
[19:44:52] <Diplomat> http://zinoui.com/blog/cross-domain-ajax-request
[19:46:19] <_f_oo> Diplomat, thank you, useful link.
[19:46:48] <Sal> it's not applying styles on the element
[19:47:15] <Sal> strange, because a few lines below, there is the same thing but with class  "absolute" and that works
[19:47:50] <Sal> what i did was changing where you tols me to
[19:47:53] <Sal> $thisSticky.addClass("fixed").css('top', limit );
[19:48:17] <Sal> if ($stickyPosition <= $window.scrollTop() + limit) {
[19:48:29] <Sal> var limit = 100
[19:49:15] <Sal> damn, its all night that i'm on this
[19:57:54] <Sal> this is the version with the limit = 100
[19:57:56] <Sal> https://codepen.io/anon/pen/QEWRPa?editors=0010
[19:58:01] <Sal> can someon eplease help?
[19:58:52] <Sal> all i did was add var limit and 2 other use of it in the code where D-rex told me to
[20:14:52] <z1haze> is there an attr for 'checked' for checkboxes? or what is the easiest way to check if an element if checked or not on change()
[20:16:05] <Sal> z1haze, prop()
[20:16:45] <z1haze> so like if($(this).prop('checked')) { ... ?
[20:17:09] <Sal> yes
[20:19:12] <z1haze> not getting anything from that, let me make a fiddle
[20:20:52] <z1haze> agh it works in the fiddle, must be my manipulation of the checkbox
[20:23:44] <Sal> :) always happens to me too, damn fiddle
[20:23:49] <z1haze> ok so something really weird, its logging true/false on jsfiddle just fine, but on my site its not doing anything
[20:23:59] <z1haze> https://jsfiddle.net/qws0anq6/
[20:25:15] <z1haze> guess its just the console logging because alerting does work.. hmm
[20:26:06] <Sal> do you have other input[type="checkbox"] in your code?
[20:26:12] <Sal> try using the id
[20:27:19] <z1haze> yea
[20:27:37] <z1haze> its working just isnt logging the value
[20:28:14] <z1haze> super weird, its not logging anything i ask it to
[20:31:13] <martin290> hey guys, i've got a really dumb question
[20:31:50] <martin290> i'm getting back JSON (i think) from a php page and i want to display one property from it called Store_ID... is this syntax correct? result.Store_ID?
[21:51:05] <laxeot> i'm trying to make a "waving" animation for this text (https://jsfiddle.net/w3w695ck/4/) but as you can see, when you navigate away from the page, the animation gets weird. so, i was told to use "requestAnimationFrame" instead of "setTimeout," but when i do, the animation gets really out of sync (https://jsfiddle.net/w3w695ck/2/). what am i doing wrong?
[21:59:36] <martin290> hey everyone
[22:39:01] <Saint_Is_> Is it a bad idea to mix a php variable with jquery?
[22:45:38] <systemfault> Usually, yes.
[22:45:54] <systemfault> But it's difficult to tell more without a context.
[23:04:03] <Saint_Is_> systemfault  http://paste.ofcode.org/GPBpZxA3Zi6M3VLuWE4aBD I need to change the index variable with my php session value where it says if(index == 0){    if I can change the 0 to the value in my $_SESSION[] it will work is there a good way to do that
[23:04:45] <systemfault> Saint_Is_: The less "evil" way is using embedded json
[23:05:10] <Saint_Is_> I'm still relatively new, haven't done anything with json yet
[23:05:50] <systemfault> Basically, you'd print: <script src="application/json" id="my-data"><?php json_encode(array('productIndex' => theIndex));</script> using PHP
[23:06:22] <systemfault> Then with jQuery, you'd do: var myData = JSON.parse($('#my-data').html());
[23:06:45] <systemfault> Then you should be able to access the index by doing: myData.productIndex
[23:06:51] <Saint_Is_> oh my
[23:07:11] <Saint_Is_> did you just write the actual code I need?
[23:08:51] <systemfault> More or less
[23:09:11] <Saint_Is_> would I place the script tag and its code in the .js file
[23:09:31] <systemfault> No, the script tags is generated via PHP and should be in your HTML template.
[23:09:46] <Saint_Is_> gotcha ok and woudl it be in the head or footer section
[23:10:07] <Saint_Is_> the <script></script> part
[23:10:20] <systemfault> Saint_Is_: As long as it's before the code that uses it.
[23:11:04] <systemfault> And now that I looked at the PHP i wrote, I forgot a "echo"
[23:11:16] <Saint_Is_> gonna try it
[23:11:17] <Saint_Is_> :)
[23:11:19] <systemfault> <script src="application/json" id="my-data"><?php json_encode(array('productIndex' => theIndex));</script> should be <script src="application/json" id="my-data"><?php echo json_encode(array('productIndex' => theIndex));</script>
[23:11:19] <Saint_Is_> Thank you !
[23:11:24] <systemfault> You're welcome.
[23:11:43] <systemfault> And theIndex should be $theIndex
[23:11:52] <systemfault> Sorry... too much C++ these days for me...
[23:13:06] <Saint_Is_> ;)
[23:13:10] <Saint_Is_> doing it now
[23:14:03] <Saint_Is_> I slightly had to change the script section to:   	<script src="application/json" id="my-data"><?php echo json_encode(array('productIndex' => theIndex));?>> </script>
[23:15:41] <systemfault> Ah, yeah, sure
[23:15:48] <systemfault> Don't forget the $ on theIndex
[23:16:46] <Saint_Is_> oh thats right..1 sec
[23:18:38] <Saint_Is_> so this is what the script looks like: http://pasteboard.co/1k7JDzWx.png
[23:18:48] <Saint_Is_> does that look correct?
[23:20:43] <Saint_Is_> systemfault  http://paste.ofcode.org/pGgETvdL479GsgdjV6pjT4    and the updated jquery look like this
[23:21:07] <systemfault> Saint_Is_: Looks good.
[23:21:17] <Saint_Is_> but I'm getting this error in console: VM6223:1 Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token < in JSON at position 0
[23:22:09] <Saint_Is_> oh wait in the product array I need to pass the session value correct?
[23:22:32] <systemfault> Sorry?
[23:23:21] <Saint_Is_> The session variable... I need to pass it in somewhere...I think
[23:23:41] <systemfault> What session variable? :/
[23:24:13] <Saint_Is_> I have a $_SESSION['productSelection']; that I want to pass to that jquery script
[23:24:25] <systemfault> Yeah, you do that using the <script> thing
[23:24:30] <Saint_Is_> I'm sorry if I wasn't clear
[23:24:35] <Saint_Is_> oh ok, 1 sec
[23:24:59] <systemfault>  <script src="application/json" id="my-data"><?php echo json_encode(array('productIndex' => $_SESSION['productSelection']));?></script> like that?
[23:26:01] <Saint_Is_> oh ok, I'll try that
[23:28:26] <systemfault> Then look at the generated HTML.. see if the JSON looks fine
[23:29:14] <Saint_Is_> 1 sec getting some headers sent error
[23:29:29] <Saint_Is_> not relate to what you help me with of course
[23:33:16] <Saint_Is_> ok, got that sorted not back to the jquery stuff... I'm getting this error  http://localhost.dividemo/cart/application/json 404 (Not Found)
[23:36:31] <Saint_Is_> systemfault is it looking for a file?
[23:36:48] <systemfault> What are you doing :(]
[23:37:12] <systemfault> I asked you to add a HTML tag to your page
[23:37:23] <systemfault> Not sure how it transformed itself into a url
[23:38:20] <Saint_Is_> ummm, my page has html tags
[23:39:19] <Saint_Is_> and this is the script tag: <script src="application/json" id="my-data"><?php echo json_encode(array('productIndex' => $productSelection));?>> </script>
[23:41:43] <systemfault> Why 2 >> and the space
[23:42:33] <Saint_Is_> I thought that would be necessary to close the tag
[23:43:02] <Saint_Is_> ok I see my script is showing up outside the top html tag...1 sec
[23:46:27] <Saint_Is_> ok sorry about the noob problems I'm having...here the console output http://pasteboard.co/1k9xvwN0.png
[23:47:02] <Saint_Is_> systemfault I pulled out the extra >>

[23:50:22] <Saint_Is_> errors gone
[23:51:59] <systemfault> Sorry... :/
[23:52:23] <Saint_Is_> OMG! thank you thank this is working perfectly!!!!!!
[23:52:37] <Saint_Is_> systemfault is brilliant!
[23:53:38] <systemfault> So.. that's the less disgusting way to pass data from PHP to JS without AJAX
[23:53:49] <Saint_Is_> I wish I understood better what is happening but it definitely works LOL
[23:56:36] <Saint_Is_> I'm excited to learn more jquery, json and ajax!
