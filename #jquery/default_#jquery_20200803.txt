[05:01:28] <sdes> Sorry for my beginner question, but does anyone understand what this function does? $('#templates-container').append($(document.querySelector('link[rel="import"]').import).find("script")); does? Does it append all the scripts found in the imported document to templates-container?
[05:15:14] <Rotfuchs> Not sure what .import does, but querySelector only yields a single result
[05:17:37] <sdes> in this case import is an HTML import, a deprecated Chrome-only (well, a mostly Chrome) function to import HTML code easily
[05:19:30] <sdes> I posted a question in stackoverflow if you need more context https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63225556/substituting-html-imports-in-jquery
[05:21:41] <Rotfuchs> So the error indicated that there is no such <link> in the document
[05:21:47] <Rotfuchs> *indicates
[05:22:37] <Rotfuchs> Oh, that's the error for the <object> version ...
[05:23:37] <Rotfuchs> You could fetch the document using .get() or .ajax()
[05:31:50] <sdes> but is that what i want? you said queryselector yields a single result
[09:06:55] <snatcher> is there a way to get unique id of juqery object? $('<div></div>').uniqueId() ->uniqueId is not a function
[13:03:17] <robertmaxrees> snatcher why do you need that?>
[13:51:38] <snatcher> robertmaxrees: to compare lists of jquery objects
[13:51:50] <robertmaxrees> There are other ways to do that :)
