[06:55:45] <codecutter> Why is the 'theme' prop not working? theme css should be included when using cdn, apparently all of it is included https://jsfiddle.net/8347n9xr/
[06:55:50] <codecutter> https://atomiks.github.io/tippyjs/v5/getting-started/#cdn
[07:02:32] <dw1> that page doesnt say themes are included
[07:02:47] <dw1> and the Themes documentation section says "They need to be imported separately."
[07:03:18] <codecutter> https://unpkg.com/browse/tippy.js@5.2.1/themes/light-border.css
[07:03:34] <dw1> üëç
[07:03:41] <codecutter> click on link 'View the package contents on unpkg'
[07:07:16] <codecutter> also tried importing 'tippyjs/src/scss/themes/light.scss'  into app's 'main.scss'
[07:08:47] <dw1> if you look at the source https://unpkg.com/tippy.js@6.2.3/dist/tippy-bundle.umd.js
[07:08:50] <dw1> you see no themes
[07:09:22] <dw1> ctrl-f material
[07:09:23] <dw1> for example
[07:11:14] <dw1> see https://jsfiddle.net/xhg1q0dt/
[07:11:19] <dw1> i included a <link at the type
[07:11:21] <dw1> top*
[07:11:25] <dw1> and it works
[07:11:46] <dw1> ‚îó(-_-)‚îõ
[07:20:48] <codecutter> if i a set prop 'interactive:true' then hover between the tooltip and the target link seems to create multiple tooltip instances - you only see the rest are. behind it (when you inspect the dom)
[07:20:52] <codecutter> is this normal?
[07:21:16] <codecutter> only see the one*
[07:27:29] <codecutter> by hover i mean quickly moving from one to other without it closing, unless its a issue on my end, it appears to create multiple tooltips stacked on top of other
[07:34:08] <codecutter> i'm missing an extra step on my end
[07:34:22] <codecutter> let me get a another fiddle
[07:35:22] <codecutter> brb
[13:54:28] <WillPittenger> Are there samples for $().filter(elements) and $().filter(selection).  https://oscarotero.com/jquery/ leaves them out.
[14:12:44] <dw1> https://api.jquery.com/filter/
[15:26:04] <Translat-Embedde> hii where can download jquery_ui builder if i try download from this https://jqueryui.com/download/ i have error code 502
[15:27:49] <dw1> just wait and try again.. they'll probably fix their server
[15:28:07] <dw1> email them if you get impatient
[15:29:27] <dw1> it could just be intermittent if it's due to excessive traffic
[15:29:59] <Translat-Embedde> dw1: if i click download website make redirect to this website https://download.jqueryui.com/download and the error code 502 that bad gateway
[15:30:16] <dw1> bad gateway is usually from high traffic and temporary
[15:30:20] <dw1> yeah
[15:30:28] <dw1> or some maintenance
[15:30:34] <dw1> but if its permanent and they dont know about it.. could email them
[15:31:40] <dw1> or tweet or github or wherever you can
[15:31:42] <Translat-Embedde> bad gateway can be if change https to http or other yes it can be from high traffic or other
[20:59:54] <Jaseinatl> I have a footer bar on a page that when an element is clicked, I want to animate the footer height to show the relevant content. However, if the footer is already extended with a different link is clicked, I want to animate the content only leaving the footer expanded. --pretty easy, but...
[21:00:44] <Jaseinatl> if the footer is not expanded, I don't want to animate the content, just the footer. I want the content to immediate be active, not animated into active. Any suggestions? I will post a codepen.
