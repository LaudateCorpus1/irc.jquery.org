[00:00:20] <petoo> hi
[00:01:13] <teitoklein01> hello please help me
[00:01:30] <petoo> I've a jquery dialog which when closing gives " #<object> has no method dialog " error,
[00:01:48] <petoo> I didnt find any duplicate entries for jquery-min.js
[00:02:26] <petoo> Once the dialog box is closed it doesnt open again *
[00:02:59] <Cork> petoo: sounds like you've given a jquery object to a selector where a string was expected
[00:04:09] <teitoklein01> Hi! is it possible in jquery to auto-center a div for example when scrolling on screen
[00:04:22] <teitoklein01> or clicking somewhere
[00:04:39] <petoo> cork this is where the problem  occurs $("#editPost").dialog('open');
[00:06:44] <petoo> cork oh yes, there is one more line where I am supplying , $(this).dialog('close');
[00:10:39] <Cork> petoo: no its when its triggered, its most likely triggered when you define the dialog
[00:10:51] <Cork> dialog({ /* here */})
[00:11:10] <petoo> Cork: pastebin?
[00:12:33] <petoo> http://pastebin.com/BxsEs06L
[00:14:46] <Cork> petoo: hmm
[00:15:01] <Cork> petoo: does it happen if you comment out the open and close handlers?
[00:15:23] <Cork> (i don't see how that would be the problem, but...)
[00:17:58] <petoo> Cork: after commenting it out, I got no error , (though it wasn't showing my data as expected)
[00:18:23] <Cork> petoo: ya, wasn't meant as a fix
[00:18:33] <Cork> petoo: so the error happens in your handers
[00:18:34] <petoo> yes I understand
[00:18:39] <petoo> exactly
[00:18:43] <Cork> that was the test
[00:18:50] <Cork> so test them one at a time
[00:18:55] <petoo> ok
[00:19:04] <Cork> they look fine to me but...
[00:19:31] <Cork> petoo: one thing could be that this isn't the inner div, but the dialog class
[00:19:49] <Cork> or the wrapper div
[00:19:59] <Cork> and that would explain why things break
[00:20:36] <petoo> this time I made "open" visible again and I get error
[00:20:58] <Cork> petoo: even if you comment out the load line?
[00:22:22] <petoo> no, commenting out load doesnt give any errror
[00:22:58] <xp_prg> hi all I am new to timers, what is the best way to do this, do I need jquery?
[00:23:06] <xp_prg> I am using jquery right now
[00:24:13] <Cork> petoo: so try $(this.element).load instead of $(this).load
[00:24:29] <petoo> ok
[00:24:31] <Cork> xp_prg: do what?
[00:24:52] <xp_prg> how do I setup a timer?
[00:25:05] <Cork> ?mdc setTimeout
[00:25:18] <Cork> `mdc setTimeout
[00:25:24] * Cork hits the bots
[00:25:45] <Cork> xp_prg: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/DOM/window.setTimeout
[00:30:31] <petoo> Cork: the element?
[00:30:40] <Cork> hmm?
[00:31:03] <petoo> this.element , which element is this
[00:31:26] <Cork> i was hoping that it would be the content element in the dialog
[00:33:42] <Guddu> Is there a version of dropkick available that works with JQuery 1.9?
[00:34:09] <Cork> Guddu: try the jquery-migration plugin
[00:34:22] <Cork> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-migrate/
[00:35:40] <Guddu> Thanks Cork Just the inlcusion of the tool will make it work?
[00:36:08] <Cork> Guddu: until the original plugin has been updated it should help ya
[00:37:31] <Cork> petoo: hmm, just tested and no it looks like the old code is correct http://jsfiddle.net/E2Q8n/1/
[00:37:55] <Cork> petoo: have you checked so its not js in the fragment your loading?
[00:39:28] <petoo> the only thing I suspected so far, is that I am missing some js, or I am using outdated version
[00:39:50] <Cork> petoo: see if you can reproduce it in jsfiddle
[00:39:51] <petoo> I've very less experience using jquery
[00:39:57] <petoo> sure I'll try
[00:41:02] <Guddu> Thanks Cork
[00:44:42] <Guddu> Cork, I am using a local copy of JQuery.js....I am missing all the images though. Where can i get it from?
[00:45:09] <Cork> Guddu: jquery.js doens't depend on any images
[00:45:14] <Cork> jquery-ui does though
[00:45:19] <Guddu> Oh sorry. UI i meant
[00:45:36] <Cork> http://jqueryui.com/download/
[00:53:02] <Guddu> Cork, I download jquery-ui-1.10.1.custom.js but with that the images don't show up and I don't see any error message either in Chrome console as it was happening before.
[00:53:24] <Cork> Guddu: no, download the zip
[00:53:32] <Cork> Guddu: the images isn't in the js file
[00:53:40] <Cork> same with the css rules
[00:53:47] <Guddu> I downloaded the Zip and copied only js in my web app
[00:54:01] <Cork> you need the css files, the image folder and the js file
[00:54:44] <Guddu> Cork, I think i forgot to include CSS..sorry ...
[00:59:45] <Guddu> Cork, I included the CSS and i still see this issue. The dialog box does not have the image of close button for example.
[01:02:38] <Ortund> Cork, I've ported that weather stuff I've been working on to a plugin
[01:02:45] <Ortund> my first ever jquery plugin *beams*
[01:03:22] <vinex08> anyone knows how to make this http://jqueryfordesigners.com/coda-slider-effect/   auto?
[01:15:24] <aghouseh> anyone ever work with jquery ui on mobile?
[01:15:45] <Cork> sure
[01:16:04] <Cork> but ask your question instead of for ppl
[01:16:59] <aghouseh> oh, right sorry. having problems with the dialog coming up uncentered on mobile
[01:17:25] <aghouseh> http://paste.nuggetboard.com/image/2u0S2f1D3N3q
[01:18:14] <aghouseh> even if i try to manually run the center method via $('.ui-dialog').dialog('option', 'position', 'center'); it does nothing
[01:25:05] <Cork> agcolom: ah, never used dialogs on mobile, doesn't feel native to me
[01:25:15] <Cork> doens't feel valida at all actually
[01:25:22] <Cork> *aghouseh:
[01:25:44] <Cork> aghouseh: but i suspect it might be cause the zoom feature in mobiles
[01:25:46] <aghouseh> yeah i feel ya
[01:26:00] <aghouseh> well, ive got the zoom sticking to full width by default
[01:26:07] <aghouseh> i think it just doesnt detect the viewport properly or something
[01:26:29] <aghouseh> but i agree that it doesnt feel right on mobile
[01:26:32] <magixx256> im trying to load 2 images into two divs with a js function via jquery, for some reason whenever i try to load the 2nd image into the second div, that div loses all its styling, the first div loads fine and keeps its styling but the second does not
[01:26:33] <magixx256> $("#someshit").load(encodeURI(imgQueryString));
[01:26:38] <Cork> aghouseh: just check what window.<height/widht/so on> shows
[01:26:38] <djQuery> damn gotta find a new rss reader
[01:26:40] <aghouseh> just trying to bandaid this site until i can get a better solution
[01:26:44] <magixx256> is what the second and first look like
[01:26:48] <Cork> djQuery: ya, same here
[01:27:04] <djQuery> Cork, google reader?
[01:27:11] <Cork> yes
[01:28:02] <Cork> djQuery: i'm thinking of trying feedly
[01:28:17] <Cork> djQuery: they plan to implement the google reader api in an appengine instance :)
[01:29:00] <Cork> djQuery: http://blog.feedly.com/2013/03/14/google-reader/
[01:29:08] <AdamPDotty> magix: first of all, why not just set the image src and alt attributes?
[01:29:37] <djQuery> Cork, realy liked having all my widgets on my start page
[01:30:02] <Cork> djQuery: igoogle is depricated too
[01:30:10] <Cork> and all that
[01:30:15] <djQuery> hence the liked
[01:30:34] <Cork> djQuery: i only used google reader as a backend and a desktop client
[01:30:34] <magixx256> im calling a php page to get me code with an image and and a url to the next image
[01:30:49] <Cork> so i think i will be ok if i can find an application that can replace it
[01:31:14] <Cork> didn't like the tracking done by google with reader anyway, so...
[01:31:27] <djQuery> Cork, most the time the only app I have open is chrome lol
[01:31:31] <Cork> (there haven't really been an alternative for years though)
[01:31:40] <Cork> djQuery: ah heh
[01:31:43] <djQuery> pageflakes?
[01:32:07] <Cork> djQuery: have a check on the extension for chrome then, you might feel ok with it
[01:32:09] <djQuery> dang think they are gone too
[01:32:51] <Cork> i haven't really tested it yet, but don't really see an alternative yet
[01:44:56] <samirtah> hi jquery people
[01:48:25] <djQuery> yo
[01:49:22] <djQuery> wish they would open source the stuff thier not using anymore
[01:53:46] <djQuery> Cork, all thier plugin is a link to thier page
[01:54:20] <Cork> djQuery: ya, i'm labbing with it now
[01:54:43] <Cork> and they'r demanding a bit too much info from my account for my liking
[01:55:00] <Cork> djQuery: scroll to the top and you can login to google and it should ask to connect
[01:55:18] <Cork> but it feels like a no-go for me...
[01:55:21] <Cork> damn...
[01:56:45] <djQuery> search sucks
[01:57:32] <Cork> looks like this is going to suck how ever you turn it (though search sucked in google reader too)
[01:58:45] <djQuery> Cork, time to build an offline one that just loads jquery and a page and has the option to save to server for synching serveral desktops
[01:58:50] <djQuery> synching costs?
[01:59:19] <Cork> ya, i'm thinking of moving it inhouse too
[01:59:57] <Cork> what i have a hard time figuring out is how to make it available on the mobile...
[02:01:28] <djQuery> the trouble is with out a backend to have them marked as read if you look at it on your phone then they will be unread on desktop
[02:01:49] <Cork> djQuery: oh, no i meant to have it remote
[02:02:05] <Cork> ya, syncing if you actually pulled on the phone would suck
[02:03:09] <Cork> djQuery: hmm, http://tt-rss.org/
[02:03:10] <djQuery> ?g node.js newsreader
[02:03:10] <b-ot> djQuery: mborho/silozippr · GitHub → https://github.com/mborho/silozippr
[02:04:01] <Cork> i acutally prefer to keep the old news around
[02:04:15] <Cork> i use it for help articles quite often
[02:04:52] <djQuery> thats why feedly won't do for me its search sucked
[02:05:20] <Cork> it scares me if it was actually worse then greader...
[02:05:25] <Cork> wow...
[02:05:34] <usaaabb> hi dear
[02:05:40] <usaaabb> how are you ?
[02:06:02] <djQuery> they tried to make finding new feeds and searching current feeds into one ui
[02:06:10] <magixx256> how the heck do i get a div to center an image if there is only one of them or have two of them sidede by side if there are two
[02:06:31] <magixx256> this seems so simple
[02:06:48] <djQuery> magixx256, it is but thats a #css question
[02:07:07] <Cork> magixx256: some extra wrapping and margin:auto
[02:07:13] <Cork> but ya its a question for #css
[02:07:51] <davetarmac> hey djQuery - had a bash at that cycle({ after: ..., }); thing you recommended yesterday but couldn't get it sorted...
[02:08:26] <djQuery> davetarmac, sorry man was the first time I was looking at that one
[02:08:40] <djQuery> davetarmac, don't think what you are trying is too common
[02:10:00] <davetarmac> ah right - anyone else in here good with Cycle and making it cascade across multiple instances?
[02:14:23] <djQuery> after: function(){ var $this = $(this) nextCylce = $this.next(); if ($this.data('started') || !nextCylce.length; ){return;} $this.data('started', true);  var waitTime = nextCyle.data('waittime'); setTimeout(function(){ nextCyle.cycle()}, waitTime); }
[02:14:33] <djQuery> davetarmac, make sense?
[02:14:58] <Cork> djQuery: you missed a comma there
[02:15:05] <djQuery> Cork, lol
[02:15:13] <djQuery> missed lotsa stuff prob
[02:15:16] <Cork> :)
[02:15:22] <Cork> var $this = $(this) nextCylce = $this.next(); <--
[02:15:51] <AdamPDotty> leo cylce
[02:16:12] <Fuzai> Hi could someone take a look at this: http://dev.neurobots.net/test/botstats.html I'm trying to dynamically set the "tabs-1" div and it's not working for me
[02:16:30] <samirtah> why is object oriented is so good ? why to use a tank in order to kill a bird ?
[02:16:46] <djQuery> AdamPDotty, this aint no spelling bee when I am typing multilines code in single line input
[02:16:51] <Cork> Fuzai: $( "#tabs-1" ).html(room_description);
[02:16:59] <Fuzai> ohhhhhh
[02:17:01] <Fuzai> ty Cork
[02:17:08] <Cork> your actually overwriting the html function :)
[02:17:17] <Fuzai> heh
[02:17:27] <Cork> *you're
[02:17:48] <Fuzai> Sorry i'm really new to javascript & jQuery and it hasn't clicked yet at all
[02:17:53] <Cork> np
[02:18:05] <djQuery> Fuzai, see ?tryjq
[02:18:11] <Fuzai> ?tryjq
[02:18:13] <djQuery> dang lazy bot
[02:18:15] <Fuzai> hehe
[02:18:23] <Cork> djQuery: its not lazy, its not here :)
[02:18:25] <djQuery> http://try.jquery.com
[02:18:27] <runtyrobot> Mornin
[02:18:35] <Cork> `tryjq
[02:18:43] <Cork> but the other one is lazy...
[02:18:51] <Fuzai> wow hey that's cool looing
[02:18:55] <Fuzai> looking too
[02:18:58] <Fuzai> ty djQuery
[02:19:35] <djQuery> Fuzai, took me about 20 mins to finish it after skiping all the vids
[02:19:51] <Fuzai> do i need to watch the vids?
[02:19:56] <Fuzai> i don't have any speakers plugged in
[02:20:08] <djQuery> Fuzai, there are slides as well
[02:20:26] <Fuzai> So I should find some speakers?
[02:20:36] <Fuzai> it looks like he's talking to me
[02:20:38] <Fuzai> :(
[02:20:47] <djQuery> Fuzai, the slides have the same info
[02:21:18] <djQuery> when learning something new I like reading the transcript while listening to it at the same time
[02:21:28] <djQuery> makes it stick better
[02:21:31] <anew> if i have a div class... how can i tell what the span below it's width is?  <div class="like"><span "style=width"></span></div>
[02:22:03] <runtyrobot> children
[02:22:10] <Cork> anew: $(div).find('span').first().width()
[02:22:17] <djQuery> $('div.like').children('span').first().width()
[02:22:20] <djQuery> dang it
[02:22:29] <anew> find or children?
[02:22:39] <Cork> depends on how deep down the child is
[02:22:50] <anew> just one level
[02:22:52] <Cork> if its a direct decedent you can use children
[02:22:53] <djQuery> is it a baby or a grandbaby
[02:22:56] <runtyrobot> It starting to sound like he's in a well.. I'll go get lassy
[02:22:56] <anew> baby
[02:22:58] <Cork> if its more then use .find
[02:24:21] <anew> hmmm getting null
[02:24:35] <anew> if i view page source, this span is not there... it is created on page load
[02:24:37] <anew> could that effect it
[02:24:48] <runtyrobot> depends on when you're looking for it
[02:24:55] <Cork> anew: what you wrote wasn't valid, make sure you don't have it like that
[02:25:06] <Cork> style="width:<something>"
[02:25:12] <anew> console.log($('.fb').find('span').first().width());
[02:25:15] <anew> thisi s what i have
[02:25:26] <Cork> in the html, not the code
[02:25:44] <anew> right the code is a plugin, not written by me
[02:25:57] <Cork> uh
[02:26:16] <Cork> i think you mixed the terms up there
[02:26:26] <anew> in my consolelog ?
[02:26:42] <Cork> are you writing it in a plugin?
[02:26:53] <davetarmac> cheers djQuery - I'll give that a go
[02:26:59] <anew> no... i have a plugin where all i do is copy the <div> of the plug in and pasted it into my site
[02:27:01] <Cork> cause thats the only code we've been talking about
[02:27:07] <anew> on page load this div creates a span below it
[02:27:14] <Cork> anew: and what i said to check what the html
[02:27:16] <anew> the span below the div that is created i want to measure the wdth with jq
[02:27:18] <Cork> html != code
[02:27:30] <anew> the html is not mine
[02:27:32] <Cork> *was
[02:27:40] <Cork> ok, and is it valid?
[02:27:44] <anew> yes of course
[02:27:52] <Cork> so its not "style=width"?
[02:27:54] <runtyrobot> Anywho - does anyone know of a good jquery drag and drop html editor. Where you can create elements and drag them into place - or do I have to make it myself?
[02:27:57] <anew> no !
[02:28:18] <Cork> anew: ok, what display type is the span?
[02:28:22] <magixx256> jquery-ui
[02:28:24] <seutje> 10 minutes to determine if somebody made a typo on irc, this *is* a slow day
[02:28:36] <djQuery> lol
[02:28:36] <Cork> seutje: lol
[02:28:50] <anew> <span style="height: 61px; width: 450px;"></span>
[02:28:54] <anew> here is the span
[02:29:07] <Cork> anew: and is there any css that sets display on it?
[02:29:13] <Cork> else those values are ignored
[02:29:13] <anew> display: inline-block
[02:29:16] <Cork> ok
[02:29:31] <Cork> does $('.fb').find('span') match that element?
[02:29:36] <anew> let me check
[02:29:58] <Cork> djQuery: oh, btw .first() isn't needed, just remembered that :D
[02:30:22] <runtyrobot> 8h
[02:30:48] <Cork> runtyrobot: ckedit
[02:30:53] <Cork> ?g ckeditor

[02:40:48] <anew> and if you inspect element on the like button there is a span created right below that div with width and height
[02:40:52] <anew> i am trying to read these values
[02:40:53] <davetarmac> djQuery: sorry to keep bugging you, but that snippet didn't work :( http://jsfiddle.net/sHbPS/10/
[02:41:03] <anew> cork / djQuery
[02:41:26] <djQuery> davetarmac, you know that snippet was real rough off the top of my head kinda thing right?
[02:42:32] <seutje> anew: ur prolly querying the DOM at a time when the span isn't created yet
[02:42:46] <anew> i'm querying on document ready, when should i query it
[02:43:43] <anew> djQuery do you see my example
[02:44:06] <davetarmac> djQuery: oh right... :s
[02:44:14] <seutje> anew: on FB.Event.subscribe('xfbml.render', function(resp) { ... }); probably
[02:44:18] <anew> here it is right here .. when i console log it i see it in the innerhtml
[02:44:23] <anew> it's thre in the console log
[02:44:31] <seutje> anew: see http://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/javascript/FB.Event.subscribe/
[02:44:41] <seutje> anew: that's cause ur prolly logging a reference to the div wrapper
[02:44:45] <anew> no please off-topic
[02:44:49] <anew> i need to do it this way
[02:44:57] <djQuery> frignin jsfiddle freeze
[02:45:16] <seutje> anew: sry, what?
[02:45:26] <anew> seutje why are you sending me to this page
[02:45:41] <anew> i need to read the width of this span created by div
[02:45:47] <seutje> anew: it's documentation on the shit ur trying to use
[02:45:52] <seutje> divs don't create spans
[02:46:06] <anew> it exists in innerhtml i see it here
[02:46:10] <anew> in console
[02:46:14] <seutje> you logged a reference
[02:46:43] <anew> if it is not created iframe, then it is created on page i should be able to read it ?
[02:47:13] <seutje> anew: FB creates the span
[02:47:34] <seutje> anew: so you have to register to FB's "I CREATED SOMETHING" event to be able to query at the right time
[02:47:45] <vinex08> anyone knows how to make this http://jqueryfordesigners.com/coda-slider-effect/   auto?
[02:47:45] <seutje> either that or put up a derpy "is it ready yet?" time loop
[02:48:28] <anew> event.subscribe won't work, you need an api key
[02:48:47] <anew> so how can i see innerhtml if it is not created yet
[02:49:21] <djQuery> ?settimeout
[02:49:32] <djQuery> anew, wait for it to be created
[02:49:49] <anew> let me try settimtout
[02:51:08] <ryuhamayoshi> hi does somebody know a solution to get the .find() function working in IE?
[02:51:20] <anew> still not... with settimeout it is catching the iframe below the span, but not the actual span
[02:51:21] <ryuhamayoshi> I'm struggling with this problem for several days
[02:51:26] <Cork> ryuhamayoshi: .find works just fine in ie
[02:51:28] <anew> the span must be created on page load
[02:51:31] <seutje> anew: allow me to illustrate why you were seeing a span in the console: http://jsfiddle.net/eZErx/
[02:51:31] <Cork> ?p @ ryuhamayoshi
[02:51:38] <Cork> *sigh*
[02:51:58] <Cork> ryuhamayoshi: paste your problematic code in ex. jsfiddle
[02:52:06] <djQuery> frigin 5 am nit guys
[02:52:11] <anew> damnit
[02:52:13] <anew> daj
[02:52:13] <anew> ok
[02:52:15] <anew> goodnight
[02:52:16] <anew> thx
[02:52:19] <Cork> djQuery: sleep tight
[02:52:23] <ryuhamayoshi> ok so what's wrong ... : $(status.find('input[.box_status]:checkbox:checked')).each(function() {
[02:52:23] <ryuhamayoshi>         checks.push($(this).val());
[02:52:23] <ryuhamayoshi>       });
[02:52:32] <ryuhamayoshi> this works in chrome but not in IE
[02:52:35] <Cork> ryuhamayoshi: paste in in fiddle
[02:52:40] <Cork> don't dump it in the channel
[02:52:40] <anew> http://jsfiddle.net/RwAsH/ seutje please look here
[02:52:44] <anew> this finds the iframe
[02:52:46] <anew> but not the span
[02:53:11] <seutje> this throws a reference error for me
[02:53:32] <anew> erm well the html and everything isnt there, this is not a working demo
[02:53:39] <anew> please trust me it shows the iframe lol
[02:53:44] <djQuery> anew, you would never find it on my machine anyway it would be blocked
[02:53:51] <anew> right before the iframe there is <span>
[02:53:57] <anew> on your machine djQuery?
[02:53:59] <anew> what do u mean
[02:54:00] <Cork> anew: uh, is the iframe loaded from facebook?
[02:54:09] <Cork> ah
[02:54:10] <djQuery> block social buttons
[02:54:23] <Cork> anew: you need to include the html in the html section there
[02:54:28] <Cork> anew: and pick a framework
[02:54:28] <anew> cork yes, but right before the iframe there is a <span> which i can't get !
[02:54:34] <ryuhamayoshi> http://jsfiddle.net/RwAsH/1/
[02:54:39] <ryuhamayoshi> what's wrong ?
[02:55:01] <Cork> ryuhamayoshi: whats status ?
[02:55:14] <Cork> and your selector is broken
[02:55:26] <ryuhamayoshi> status is form id
[02:55:40] <Cork> so you need to include the code your referencing
[02:55:45] <ryuhamayoshi> and every checkbox has the class box_status
[02:55:46] <Cork> status and checks
[02:55:48] <djQuery> ryuhamayoshi, so yo uhave an attribute called .box_status or you have a class called that
[02:56:02] <ryuhamayoshi> box_status = checkboxes classes
[02:56:09] <djQuery> input.box_status
[02:56:10] <Cork> [] is for attributes
[02:56:24] <ryuhamayoshi> class attribute?
[02:56:28] <Cork> no
[02:56:44] <ryuhamayoshi> so it should be like : input.box_status:checkbox:checked
[02:56:47] <Cork> ryuhamayoshi: just include the missing parts and i can fix up the code
[02:56:59] <Cork> but right now its not complete enough to do that
[02:57:02] <anew> guys please, i am so close, when i do this console.log($('#fb-like1').find('span').html()); i am seeing the <iframe> below the span, not the span <div><span><iframe></iframe></span></div>
[02:57:07] <djQuery> ryuhamayoshi, yeah but thats gonna be slow
[02:57:30] <djQuery> ryuhamayoshi, do you have radios with the same class?
[02:57:41] <djQuery> if not you could get rid of the checkbox
[02:57:52] <ryuhamayoshi> http://jsfiddle.net/RwAsH/4/
[02:58:07] <anew> actually wait i think i can do what i want with the iframe here
[02:58:49] <anew> haha
[02:58:49] <anew> woot
[02:58:50] <anew> got it
[02:58:55] <anew> u guys kick ass
[02:59:04] <anew> doing the pope's work in here
[02:59:17] <Cork> ryuhamayoshi: http://jsfiddle.net/RwAsH/5/
[03:00:33] <ryuhamayoshi> ok thanks I'll try it ;-)
[03:00:39] <ryuhamayoshi> strange it worked in chrome...
[03:01:25] <ryuhamayoshi> now it still works in chrome and going to try it in IE :-)
[03:01:53] <Cork> that you actually got anything working out of chrome with that scares me a bit
[03:02:03] <ryuhamayoshi> lol
[03:02:39] <ryuhamayoshi> ok in IE it doesn't POST the array of checked checkboxes :s
[03:02:46] <Fuzai> Holy crap everyone, i think i'm understanding jquery finally!
[03:02:52] <anew> fuzai no u dont
[03:03:00] <Cork> its not an array of checkboxes
[03:03:08] <Fuzai> i know gimmie 10 mins and i'll forget it all again
[03:03:20] <seutje> anew: remove the .find('span') and u'll see the html for the span
[03:03:21] <ryuhamayoshi> checks.push() is not an array?
[03:03:35] <seutje> anew: ur just logging the "inside" of the span
[03:03:45] <Cork> ryuhamayoshi: var checks = [];
[03:04:02] <ryuhamayoshi> var checks = new Array; not good?
[03:04:23] <seutje> anew: also, fixed ur example: http://jsfiddle.net/RwAsH/3/ and made it less shitty: http://jsfiddle.net/RwAsH/6/
[03:04:29] <Cork> definitely not without the parentheses, but not sure how ie handles it
[03:04:29] <djQuery> ryuhamayoshi, no but new Array() is
[03:04:40] <seutje> derpy timer ftw
[03:05:41] <anew> seutje i see
[03:05:44] <anew> i did it without the loop tho
[03:05:52] <Cork> ryuhamayoshi: try http://jsfiddle.net/RwAsH/7/
[03:06:28] <ryuhamayoshi> allright sec... :)
[03:06:50] <seutje> anew: sweet, should prolly know though, that the width of the span will equal the data-width of the div, just saying...
[03:07:41] <ryuhamayoshi> Cork: works also for me, but still no success in IE posting the "array" of checks
[03:08:06] <Cork> ryuhamayoshi: what exactly isn't working there?
[03:08:17] <Cork> the code crashes?
[03:08:34] <djQuery> ryuhamayoshi, have you looked at serialize so that you dont have to loop through them
[03:08:55] <djQuery> heck dont even have to select the :checked serialize will take care of that
[03:08:58] <ryuhamayoshi> hmm ...
[03:09:08] <ryuhamayoshi> how does that work?
[03:09:10] <Cork> djQuery: serializeArray is only option as he modifies it
[03:09:17] <ryuhamayoshi> I'm rather new to jQuery
[03:09:23] <djQuery> ah
[03:09:28] <ryuhamayoshi> :)
[03:09:48] <Cork> ryuhamayoshi: http://api.jquery.com/serializeArray/
[03:10:38] <Cork> ryuhamayoshi: but we need to have more info of what fails, else its hard to locate the problem
[03:11:02] <ryuhamayoshi> Cork: Sec. I'm trying to get more info via PHP Post
[03:11:06] <anew> seutje width of the span will equal what ?
[03:11:14] <Cork> ryuhamayoshi: also, you should think about going in to the 21'th century, and have event listeners instead of event attributes
[03:11:18] <anew> i dont understand, so u mean there is an easier way or ...
[03:11:33] <seutje> anew: data-width of the div, that's how FB determines what width to give it
[03:15:11] <ryuhamayoshi> hmm ok in chrome I get a nice Array via printing the $_POST, in IE I get nothing from the checkboxes
[03:15:26] <ryuhamayoshi> So it normally works fine, but not in IE :s
[03:15:42] <Cork> and if you console.log(checks) after the map?
[03:15:50] <Cork> oh, ** its ie
[03:15:52] <Cork> um...
[03:15:56] <ryuhamayoshi> :p
[03:16:07] <Cork> alert(checks.length)
[03:16:20] <Fuzai> http://download.jqueryui.com/download i get a bad gateway when trying to download a theme from theme roller
[03:18:22] <ryuhamayoshi> in chrome = 2; IE = 0 ;-)
[03:18:32] <seutje> Fuzai: what theme was it? or was it customized?
[03:18:37] <ryuhamayoshi> length ..
[03:18:39] <Fuzai> Seems like all of them
[03:18:43] <Fuzai> but i was trying the darkness theme
[03:18:53] <seutje> http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jqueryui/1.7.2/themes/ui-darkness/jquery-ui.css
[03:19:10] <Fuzai> do i just add that as a script src?
[03:19:13] <ryuhamayoshi> I think it's the .find() function that is the problem
[03:19:30] <seutje> Fuzai: u wanted the theme, it's just css
[03:19:44] <seutje> actually, that's an outdated version, I'm afraid
[03:19:46] <Fuzai> ohh nm i see what you are saying now
[03:19:50] <Cork> ryuhamayoshi: alert(status.find('input.box_status:checked').length) ?
[03:20:16] <Cork> ryuhamayoshi: no i think its your selector that is, or scopes
[03:20:55] <Cork> ryuhamayoshi: if that last selector fails you need to run your page through w3c validator
[03:21:15] <ryuhamayoshi> Cork: same problem, chrome 2, IE 0
[03:21:22] <Cork> ryuhamayoshi: if that last selector fails you need to run your page through w3c validator <--
[03:21:28] <ryuhamayoshi> allright
[03:21:33] <ryuhamayoshi> I'll check that one ;-)
[03:21:45] <ryuhamayoshi> thanks for the help guys :)
[03:21:57] <seutje> Fuzai: ah, here we go http://jqueryui.com/resources/download/jquery-ui-themes-1.10.1.zip
[03:22:04] <Fuzai> ty :)
[03:22:05] <Cork> ryuhamayoshi: np
[03:22:15] <seutje> it's all default themes in a single package, but I'm sure u can lift the darkness theme out of there
[03:22:20] <Fuzai> ok
[03:29:01] <glosoli> are there Less files available for jQuiery ui ?
[03:29:14] <Cork> less files?
[03:29:44] <Cork> you mean if they've removed css files or similar?
[03:29:58] <glosoli> I mean if they provide LESS somewhere
[03:30:06] <Cork> no
[03:30:13] <glosoli> Ah that sucks ;/
[03:30:14] <Cork> not less or sass or scss
[03:30:30] <Cork> just pure css
[03:30:45] <Cork> glosoli: well css should work everywhere less doens't
[03:31:14] <glosoli> well less compiles to css, and gives flexibility for third party stuff like bootstrap, and would give the same for jquery ui.
[03:31:32] <glosoli> Now for small slider which I need only couple classes from 500 lines of css
[03:31:41] <glosoli> I must either be stupid and make custom, or use default and be even more stupid
[03:32:53] <Misan> hi there!
[03:33:44] <Fuzai> Hey seutje thanks for making me download the whole set of theme i would have never had guessed how easy it was to switch between them without doing it
[03:36:50] <seutje> glosoli: http://css2less.cc/
[03:38:18] <glosoli> seutje: that gives no flexibility as then it will not follow original UI styles
[03:38:44] <apeiros_> hi there. with query 1.9, I have two competing event handlers (via $(selector).on(event, liveSelector, cb)) - how can I define priority of those handlers?
[03:39:18] <apeiros_> one is on the tr of a dynamic table, the other on an input within such a tr
[03:39:19] <seutje> glosoli: not sure what that means, they are the original UI styles for the darkness theme
[03:39:45] <seutje> apeiros_: their order in _data('events')
[03:40:06] <seutje> their normal order is the order in which they were bound
[03:40:12] <seutje> but u can manipulate the array
[03:40:20] <seutje> or object, rather
[03:41:05] <apeiros_> seutje: hrm. ok. thanks for the hint. I'll see whether I can work out a nice generic solution from that.
[03:45:58] <seutje> apeiros_: here's an example reversing the click handlers array: http://jsfiddle.net/9fFW9/
[03:46:10] <seutje> causing the first to be run last
[03:46:46] <apeiros_> seutje: the problem is, I'd like them to be ordered by nesting level. such that bubbling/stopPropagation is in proper order…
[03:47:01] <BarisW> I pass some values to elements using the data attribute, like <li data-ingredients="tomato apple pear">, and I target them using a query selector like li:not[data-ingredients*="apple"]. However, this does not work if part of the word exist.
[03:47:08] <apeiros_> and that'd have to be evaluated at the moment the handler kicks in
[03:47:27] <BarisW> for instance, all li elements with the ingredient 'waterapple' are selected when 'apple' is searched for
[03:47:49] <BarisW> how can I overcome this? Is there a query selector to search for exact strings within a space-seperated list?
[03:48:59] <seutje> actually, there is
[03:49:03] <seutje> |= I think
[03:49:23] <seutje> ?attribute selector
[03:50:11] <seutje> no, ~= it seems
[03:50:46] <seutje> BarisW: http://jsfiddle.net/sKCWQ/1/
[03:50:56] <seutje> do note that's a rather brutal selector
[03:51:07] <BarisW> seutje: awesome thanks. ;)
[03:51:26] <seutje> BarisW: http://jsfiddle.net/sKCWQ/2/ should already be a bit less brutal
[03:51:50] <seutje> but still, it's kinda costly matching space-delimited list in a dom attr
[03:51:55] <BarisW> seutje: whats the difference?
[03:53:18] <BarisW> seutje: ah I see
[03:53:19] <seutje> actually, QSA understand :not(), doesn't it?
[03:53:25] <seutje> understands*
[03:53:30] <seutje> I should test this
[03:53:32] <BarisW> awesome, thanks. It works now
[03:53:37] <apeiros_> seutje: I think I'll create a new function, $.nestedOn, which does the same as $.on, but sorts the event handlers by the nesting of the selector
[03:53:41] <BarisW> Great too see you here too ;)
[03:53:42] <apeiros_> i.e., deeper nested handlers first
[03:53:53] <seutje> BarisW: :)
[03:53:57] <apeiros_> just how bubbling is supposed to work
[03:54:13] <seutje> apeiros_: bubling works on a single event, not a series of events
[03:54:17] <seutje> bubbling*
[03:54:32] <apeiros_> seutje: no, it does not work properly on a single event
[03:55:02] <apeiros_> I'll make an example
[03:55:05] <seutje> ok
[03:56:33] <seutje> apeiros_: here's mine: http://jsfiddle.net/sKCWQ/3/\
[03:56:36] <apeiros_> seutje: http://jsfiddle.net/vmQrQ/
[03:56:38] <seutje> without the \ ofc
[03:56:48] <apeiros_> with proper bubbling, the handler for baz would fire first
[03:57:04] <apeiros_> but since it's just related to order of definition, it isn't necessarily fired first
[03:57:36] <seutje> oh like that, well yeah of course, they're bound to foo, and ur binding 2 handlers
[03:57:40] <apeiros_> i.e., the handler on 'foo' would have to sort the selectors by deepest matching nesting level first
[03:57:50] <seutje> no, there's 2 handlers on there
[03:57:54] <seutje> they fire in succession
[03:57:59] <seutje> each checking their own target
[03:58:22] <apeiros_> you mean stopPropagation would not work even when executed in different order?
[03:58:30] <seutje> should bind a single one then
[03:58:35] <apeiros_> I can't
[03:58:56] <noregret> i want to select a (class='page' and id!='paging') is that possible
[03:58:58] <apeiros_> they handle different concerns and come from quite different places
[03:59:20] <apeiros_> got to go for lunch, friends are waiting. thanks for your time so far seutje!
[03:59:28] <seutje> enjoy!
[03:59:55] <seutje> noregret: $('.page').not('#paging') ?

[04:30:53] <noregret> anybody uses bootpag? paginatino for bootstrap
[04:31:19] <BennyJD> Hey. Need some help with this problem if anyone can
[04:31:19] <BennyJD> http://pastebin.com/VJD3bx33
[04:31:23] <BennyJD> Around like 28
[04:31:30] <BennyJD> It is not registering the keybind
[04:31:35] <xec> noregret: no, but i believe there is a separate bootstrap channel, might have more luck there
[04:32:15] <Cork> BennyJD: does the selector actually match the target?
[04:32:21] <Cork> chat.entry.length
[04:32:39] <BennyJD> What do you mean match the target?
[04:32:44] <xec> noregret: ##twitter-bootstrap
[04:32:45] <apeiros_> seutje: ok, I understood you correctly and I have indeed 2 problems. First problem is ordering the events by nesting depth, second problem is stopping handler execution after propagation was stopped.
[04:33:21] <Cork> BennyJD: chat.entry.length
[04:33:27] <apeiros_> seutje: 2nd problem illustrated using your example: http://jsfiddle.net/9fFW9/6/ - the aim is that upon clicking, the link's name changes to "click meH1", not "click meH1H2" as right now
[04:33:30] <BennyJD> What about it
[04:33:37] <xec> BennyJD: is it 0 ?
[04:33:41] <apeiros_> I'll try and see whether I can come up with a halfway decent plugin
[04:33:42] <BennyJD> No
[04:33:56] <Cork> BennyJD: what is .entry?
[04:34:06] <BennyJD> A <textarea>
[04:34:22] <Cork> donno then
[04:34:30] <Cork> BennyJD: can't guess anymore from dead code
[04:34:53] <Cork> BennyJD: try make a working example in jsfiddle
[04:34:58] <Cork> .p
[04:35:00] <BennyJD> Anything else you can do if you have more information/resources
[04:35:08] <Cork> yes
[04:35:11] <mmoore> can someone point me to a good tutorial of using jquery to make a secure ajax request to a REST api using basic authentication?
[04:35:15] <Cork> but it needs to be running code

[04:39:21] <BennyJD> http://jsfiddle.net/HYAtp/1/
[04:39:23] <davetarmac> this is rubbish - I'm STILL struggling with that cascading cycles :(
[04:39:34] <BennyJD> When I put something in the field and press enter, it does nothing
[04:39:41] <BennyJD> It used default as well
[04:39:58] <BennyJD> And that IF comment is to do with my system
[04:40:11] <davetarmac> I'm simplifying it so that when the animation ends, the enxt is triggered and so on...
[04:40:17] <xec> BennyJD: it's trying to call the throwMessage method (which is missing in the demo)
[04:40:27] <davetarmac> but it doesn't seem to want to play
[04:42:09] <BennyJD> Live demo at http://dev.serenity.net/forum
[04:42:15] <BennyJD> In the top Shoutbox section
[04:42:39] <xec> BennyJD: dead link
[04:42:56] <BennyJD> http://dev.serenitymc.net/forum
[04:43:19] <anew> if i have an <div> layered below another <div> how can i click the top div and register it as a cick on the bottom div ?
[04:44:16] <BennyJD> And for refrence, JS file
[04:44:17] <BennyJD> http://dev.serenitymc.net/forum/shoutbox/chat.js
[04:44:27] <xec> BennyJD: i don't see an entry textarea
[04:44:50] <ribot> hi
[04:44:54] <xec> do i need to log in perhaps?
[04:45:15] <BennyJD> xec: Try now
[04:45:34] <xec> i see it now :)
[04:45:42] <ribot> i'm trying to understand what the data parameter of $.get is, as it says "A plain object or string that is sent to the server with the request.", and in actuality it is a complete html document...why would this html document be sent as data?
[04:46:20] <xec> BennyJD: chat.entry.length is 0
[04:46:28] <xec> BennyJD: wrap it in a doc ready
[04:46:38] <BennyJD> Doc ready?
[04:47:04] <anew> any way to click the bottom layer div if i click the top ?
[04:47:20] <anew> the child won't register if i click the top div, can i just skip straight to the bottom layer ?
[04:47:37] <xec> BennyJD: you need to bind to the element after it exists in the DOM structure. have a read at http://learn.jquery.com/about-jquery/how-jquery-works/
[04:48:26] <BennyJD> Can you please explain how I do it for my situation?
[04:49:14] <xec> BennyJD: your selector is run before the textarea html is parsed. just put $(document).ready(function(){ /* your code here */ });
[04:49:18] <anew> how can the style of a span be 0 in ff but 21 in chrome?  when i view source they both have the same height but when i use .find they both are different
[04:49:43] <BennyJD> ALL my code inside that?
[04:50:08] <xec> BennyJD: at least your selectors.
[04:50:19] <xec> BennyJD: or you can move your script tag to the end of the body
[04:50:29] <anew> bennyjd did u even read how to use jq
[04:50:46] <BennyJD> xec: Ah ok thanks
[04:51:00] <anew> xec how can attributes be different in chrome and firefox
[04:51:09] <anew> in chrome i'm getting height attribute 21px, in ff 0px
[04:51:16] <anew> using .fine('span');
[04:51:20] <anew> .find
[04:51:47] <xec> anew: no idea. do you have a demo?
[04:52:00] <anew> moment
[04:52:05] <BennyJD> xec: Thanks a heap! Thats fixed it. Thats for all your help
[04:52:10] <BennyJD> Thanks*
[04:52:39] <xec> BennyJD: you're welcome :)
[04:52:49] <BennyJD> See you all later
[04:53:00] <anew> xec
[04:53:01] <anew> look here
[04:53:08] * xec stares at here
[04:53:16] <anew> lmao
[04:53:17] <anew> https://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/plugins/like/
[04:53:22] <anew> here, the like button
[04:53:29] <anew> you see it has a span tag right before the iframe ta
[04:53:44] <BarisW> seutje: ping
[04:53:45] <xec> the one at the very bottom of the page?
[04:53:55] <Ortund> can anyone explain to me why my bind isn't working? http://jsfiddle.net/JBTXV/1/
[04:53:56] <anew> step 1 get like button code
[04:53:57] <anew> that one
[04:54:00] <Ortund> it just does nothing
[04:54:04] <anew> it has a span tag with height/width attributes
[04:54:10] <anew> if i console.log in chrome, i can see the height
[04:54:17] <anew> if i console.log in firefox it says height 0
[04:54:35] <BarisW> seutje: is there a way to make the selector work like 'select all where data-foo contains exactly 'poo'?' in http://jsfiddle.net/sKCWQ/2/
[04:54:58] <BarisW> so that the first item returns lol and the second doesn't
[04:55:31] <xec> anew: i get the height in ff too
[04:55:40] <anew> what command ?
[04:55:49] <xec> anew: at least in the firebug layout tool
[04:55:59] <anew> please what command
[04:56:52] <xec> no command, i just inspect and look at the height under layout
[04:57:13] <anew> yeah right i get the height there also
[04:57:18] <anew> but if you do .find
[04:57:19] <xec> jQuery isn't included on the page so...
[04:57:21] <anew> you do not get the height
[04:57:22] <Ortund> even using $(selector).hover(hoverin, hoverout); isn't working :/
[04:57:38] <anew> if you are using this plugin on your own page and use .find() you cannot get the height in ff
[04:58:16] <xec> anew: url?
[04:58:34] <anew> will make a fiddle
[05:00:36] <anew> http://jsfiddle.net/RwAsH/6/
[05:00:38] <anew> weird here it works
[05:00:40] <anew> can you verify
[05:01:00] <anew> no wat i used .html() here
[05:01:28] <xec> anew: did you not include your code in the fiddle?
[05:01:35] <xec> it's not entirely apparent what's wrong
[05:01:56] <anew> this is all i'm trying to do , it's very easy
[05:02:01] <anew> the like button on the right
[05:02:04] <anew> i am trying to console.log($('#fb-like1').find('span'));
[05:02:12] <anew> and i am getting different heights in chrome and firefox
[05:02:12] <anew> that's it
[05:04:14] <xec> anew: http://jsfiddle.net/RwAsH/8/
[05:05:12] <xec> i get a value in both chrome and ff, admittedly different values though ;)
[05:05:39] <anew> odd yeah different values
[05:05:42] <anew> and in ie it doesnt even load
[05:05:49] <anew> ok let me see about that, thanks
[05:06:28] <xec> i get 24 in IE, 29 in ff and 80(!) in chrome xD
[05:06:53] <anew> ...
[05:06:58] <anew> i get totally different values
[05:06:59] <anew> why is that
[05:07:20] <xec> maybe you already pressed it, and get the comment field from fb underneath or something
[05:07:26] <anew> no
[05:07:43] <anew> did you already press it?
[05:07:47] <xec> nop
[05:07:48] <anew> minne is asking me
[05:07:52] <anew> so strange
[05:07:59] <anew> hmmm
[05:08:43] <ph88> does somebody know a good page about custom input elements? For example: a wheel to turn something up / down ...  really custom, not just another color
[05:12:14] <seutje> ?down jsfiddle.net
[05:13:11] <b-ot> seutje: It's just you. http://jsfiddle.net is up! (200 OK)
[05:13:54] <seutje> BarisW: just remove the tilde?
[05:14:05] <seutje> [data-foo="poo"]
[05:14:25] <BarisW> hmm, but that doesn't find it when data-foo="poo anotherpoo"
[05:14:33] <BarisW> right?
[05:14:49] <Mo9a7i> When i click an (i) element, it should make 1 ajax call, instead, it is doing 20 ajax calls, since there are 20 i elements in the page with the same class selector, can you please help me on this ? http://pastebin.com/cPekypR4
[05:15:11] <abbakym> Hi all. Please guide me if I'm wrong, but it looks to me that event delegation with "on" does not work correctly for "mouseenter" and "mouseleave" events. http://jsbin.com/axuluc/2/edit Mouseleave fires every time mouseenter happens on child elements.
[05:16:04] <Ortund> Can anyone see anything wrong with my bind or hover in/out events here? It doesn't seem to be doing anything
[05:16:51] <Mo9a7i> abbakym your div isn't closing
[05:17:30] <seutje> BarisW: nope
[05:17:41] <abbakym>  Mo9a7i true, fixed  http://jsbin.com/axuluc/4/, but the problem persists
[05:17:55] <seutje> BarisW: the example I made will match the first, but not the second
[05:19:14] <Cork> Ortund: your calling your functions, not passing them
[05:20:00] <BarisW> seutje: doesn't seem to work that way?
[05:20:05] <xec> abbakym: apparently attaching to window isn't a great idea. http://jsbin.com/axuluc/6/
[05:20:21] <Cork> Ortund: http://jsfiddle.net/JBTXV/4/
[05:20:32] <seutje> BarisW: u mean it also matches the second one for you?
[05:20:44] <BarisW> seutje: indeed, I only want it to match the first
[05:21:04] <BarisW> in dutch: when searching for appel, I don't want to find appelsap :)
[05:21:14] <BarisW> or sinaasappel, in my case
[05:21:35] <Ortund> Cork, oh right, I see now :) thank you
[05:22:11] <abbakym> xec: this breaks the whole thing. I need to track events for all elements, not only for "body". And attach to window so I catch all bubbled events.
[05:22:37] <xec> abbakym: isn't that what your original were doing?
[05:23:25] <xec> abbakym: what is the use case? maybe you want mouseover/out instead of enter/leave?
[05:23:30] <abbakym> xec: yep, but it fires mouseleave every time I move from an element to its child. And it breaks the whole idea of mouseenter/mouseleave
[05:23:50] <xec> abbakym: but you wanted to track for all elements?
[05:24:32] <abbakym> xec: I want to know when mouse is above an element or its children, and know when the mouse leaves the element. And I want it for all elements.
[05:24:52] <xec> abbakym: isn't that what you had with the original?
[05:25:24] <abbakym> xec: no, in the original mouseleave was triggered when I moved from element to its children
[05:25:28] <Ortund> Cork, oddly enough, still no effect :/
[05:25:38] <Ortund> I even copied your jquery there from the fiddle
[05:25:47] <Cork> Ortund: the fiddle works for me
[05:25:54] <Ortund> it worked for me too
[05:26:02] <Cork> Ortund: well then you're doing something else in your page :)
[05:26:17] <Ortund> yes, I suspect my html structure is wrong
[05:26:48] <SackyBoy> hi guys! i have created a simple google map position tool that looks up where the user are at the moment. everything works if i don't use the <!DOCTYPE HTML> tag. But without that tag it doesn't get validated in the w3c validator and the map doesn't show up at all
[05:26:51] <xec> abbakym: ok, have you tried binding to "*" instead?
[05:26:53] <anew> how can i print to console all span tags in a page ?
[05:27:03] <seutje> BarisW: that's odd, what browser are you on? my chromesies is only matching the first
[05:27:07] <noregret> can I use wildcard such "*_paging" in selectors?
[05:27:13] <Ortund> actually looks like some arb variable names on the functions
[05:27:19] <SackyBoy> does anyone knows how i can get this to work with the <!DOCTYPE HTML>-tag? what's wrong?
[05:27:22] <Ortund> hmmm nope
[05:27:44] <seutje> BarisW: http://i.imgur.com/scJHfxT.png
[05:27:49] <Cork> noregret: no
[05:27:58] <xec> abbakym: i updated http://jsbin.com/axuluc/6/edit
[05:28:19] <abbakym> xec: it works, but doesn't it cancel all benefits of event delegation?
[05:28:24] <anew> seutje are you there... that facebook is giving me different height values in ff and chrome
[05:28:26] <anew> in ff it's always 0
[05:28:32] <anew> how can i check all height spans in a page ?
[05:28:40] <Cork> SackyBoy: validate your html, sounds like your structure is broken (as it works in quirks mode)
[05:28:45] <noregret> Cork: i want something like $('.pagination').not('#*_paging').remove(); any way for that
[05:28:57] <Cork> noregret: use classes
[05:29:02] <BarisW> seutje: thanks, but I need it the other way around.
[05:29:17] <seutje> anew: $('span').map(function(){ return $(this).height(); }); ?
[05:29:18] <BarisW> I want it to select the first item, not the second
[05:29:26] <anew> let me try thanks
[05:29:38] <Cork> noregret: you can't do that, cause the browsers doesn't support that in a remotely fast way
[05:29:45] <seutje> BarisW: remove the .not
[05:29:55] <xec> abbakym: use it as a delegate then, http://jsbin.com/axuluc/8/edit
[05:29:57] <Cork> noregret: the way its intended to be solved is my grouping the elements with classes and then use that
[05:30:03] <ladislaw> I have a checkbox that I would like to set to an image, when clicked it alternate between different images to indicate if it is checked. what would be the best approach?
[05:30:07] <seutje> BarisW: http://jsfiddle.net/sKCWQ/4/
[05:30:26] <BarisW> yeah!
[05:30:42] <abbakym> xec: yup that works thanks a lot!
[05:31:00] <noregret> Cork: true, but i want each one invidually for other stuff, but i'll add classes for that as well, thanks
[05:31:10] <Cork> noregret: so use both
[05:31:15] <ladislaw> talk to me.
[05:31:26] <ecky--ptang-zoob> Hi, how come cursor:pointer does not work on a span element? I have a click handler on a span, but the mouse cursor doesn't show as a clickable hand :(
[05:32:14] <Cork> ladislaw: set the images as backgrounds on a label element and through css shift it based on the input state
[05:32:36] <ladislaw> Cork: jq not required?
[05:32:41] <Cork> nope
[05:32:46] <Cork> pure html+css
[05:33:11] <ladislaw> are you sure? folks in #css say there no solution
[05:33:26] <ladislaw> is no*
[05:33:59] <Cork> ladislaw: <input id="img" name="a" value="a"><label for="img">&nbsp;</label> label { background-image: url(); } #img:checked + label { background-image: url(); }
[05:34:24] <SackyBoy> Cork: Okay, thank you. i will try to investigate the html
[05:37:52] <noregret> is it super wrong to put an even handler within another one ? such as http://bpaste.net/show/45LC1U9wbvzfoXZgrZhY/ the problem i'm having is taht when the click event is called several times (on the 3rd time) the inner page even get executed, what am i doin wrong here
[05:38:15] <noregret> s/even/event/
[05:38:22] <Cork> normally yes
[05:38:55] <Cork> its normally better to have the event handler static, and then filter based of a value if it should be active
[05:39:47] <noregret> Cork: i was thinking of that, but couldn't figure out how to do it with my case, which is related to several paginations on teh same page
[05:40:21] <Cork> noregret: best is to have the code work with relation to its origin
[05:40:27] <anew> so strange, what would make an attribute change from loaded dom to console ?
[05:40:31] <Cork> that way you can share code between listeners
[05:40:51] <Cork> anew: what?
[05:41:09] <ladislaw> Cork: should I include a "type" attribute in that line?
[05:41:14] <noregret> Cork: i got confused, can you elaborate on that please
[05:41:21] <anew> cork if i right click an element i see height = 29... if i console.log(height) in console i get 0, i also get 0 if i html() the element
[05:41:27] <Cork> ladislaw: yes, i just made a mockup kinda thing
[05:41:30] <anew> but all otehr propreties are correct
[05:42:02] <Cork> noregret: ex if a button from a list is clicked, find the parent and use a class to find the target in the section, instead of using an uniq id
[05:42:13] <anew> what could be changing
[05:42:16] <Cork> noregret: if the coded does the same thing for all sections you don't have to duplicate it
[05:42:47] <Cork> anew: you're prob setting height to a inline element
[05:42:58] <anew> height is being set inline
[05:43:00] <Cork> those can't have hight
[05:43:04] <anew> hmmm
[05:43:08] <Cork> *height
[05:43:08] <anew> well it works in chrome
[05:43:17] <anew> if i do console.log(height) in chrome i see it
[05:43:18] <Cork> accorting to spec they can't
[05:43:20] <anew> in firefox i do not
[05:43:24] <noregret> Cork: got it, thanks, i'll see what i can do
[05:43:26] <anew> is there a difference in browsers ?
[05:43:45] <Cork> anew: its a difference between doing what the spec says and doing it wrong
[05:43:54] <anew> i dont understand
[05:43:56] <Cork> anew: an inline element can't have height; period
[05:44:11] <Cork> if any browser allows you to set it; its a bug in that browser
[05:44:33] <Cork> anew: note though inline-block != inline
[05:44:38] <anew> it's inline-block
[05:44:40] <anew> not inline
[05:44:48] <Cork> have you made sure it is?
[05:44:56] <anew> just looked
[05:45:01] <ladislaw> Cork: I will need to also hide the checkbox somehow, right?
[05:45:06] <Cork> anew: ok, is the element in the dom?
[05:45:10] <anew> yes
[05:45:31] <Cork> ladislaw: ya, ex by sliding the label over the checkbox
[05:45:32] <xec> anew: are you still talking about the facebook like button?
[05:45:53] <anew> yes
[05:46:00] <anew> doesnt make sense how it is in chrome but not ff
[05:46:18] <Cork> ladislaw: http://www.inserthtml.com/2012/06/custom-form-radio-checkbox/
[05:46:27] <anew> could css on my page be screwing with it xec
[05:46:46] <xec> anew: maybe, is it live somewhere?
[05:46:47] <anew> no cant be because the css is inside the tags
[05:46:54] <anew> that will overrid css in .css won't it
[05:47:06] <Cork> anew: the css file can still mess with it
[05:47:16] <Cork> depends if it uses !important or not
[05:47:20] <xec> anew: unless you have !important - or there is another property changing the behaviour
[05:47:30] <anew> ok that's what i need to check next
[05:47:31] <anew> let me see
[05:48:23] <xec> anew: impossible for us to tell unless you can show us
[05:48:58] <anew> but i still dont get how it shows height in html tab in firefox, but once i go to console height becomes 0
[05:49:09] <anew> will show if i dont see anything in the css
[05:49:34] <xec> anew: i saw you mentioned you were using .html() for something earlier? what *exactly* is the code you are using to check the height?
[05:49:43] <Cork> anew: try make a testcase, its really hard helping without seeing what happens
[05:49:54] <anew> console.log($('#fb-like').find('span').height());
[05:50:17] <xec> anew: and you're sure it's an ID and not a class (like the demo earlier)?
[05:50:29] <anew> yep
[05:50:31] <xec> and the ID is unique, etc?
[05:50:40] <anew> i swear it must be a browswr thing... it works in chrome
[05:55:12] <s3d_matt> afternoon all
[05:55:41] <anew> am i correct that jquery cannot read iframe elements in a page
[05:55:50] <Cork> it can
[05:55:55] <anew> o rly
[05:55:59] <Cork> but the browser won't let uou read cross domains
[05:56:04] <anew> shit so i'm going crazy over nothing then
[05:56:07] <anew> mmm
[05:56:07] <anew> shit
[05:56:09] <Cork> you will get a security warning
[05:56:16] <Cork> (and be blocked)
[05:56:17] <anew> so if the iframe points to another domain i cannot with jq read the divs
[05:56:24] <Cork> nope
[05:56:28] <anew> grrr
[05:56:36] <s3d_matt> I'm struggling to loop through a domain, as the keys are no 0,1,2,3,4 etc…. Anyone help me - also anyone know how to alert a array - i tried the .join, which might mean my array is also wrong :(
[05:56:37] <s3d_matt> http://pastebin.com/42PCSm0n
[05:57:16] <Cork> s3d_matt: loop through a domain?
[05:57:30] <s3d_matt> opps lol, sorry array
[05:57:35] <s3d_matt> god, i can't even type tday
[05:57:42] <Cork> you want to join it?
[05:57:45] <Cork> or..?
[05:58:07] <Cork> pricesArray[this.id] = finalPriceValue; <-- this is not supported on an array
[05:58:17] <s3d_matt> in short, its for open cart, there are lots of drop downs, of options which effect the end price
[05:58:25] <s3d_matt> I want to add up all these to update the final price
[05:58:31] <s3d_matt> http://perscanvas.dns-systems.net/index.php?route=product/product&product_id=54
[05:58:35] <anew> ok another hypothetical lol... if the iframe is inside a smaller div, and the iframe overflows out of the div, can i detect if the iframe is overflowing or not
[05:59:07] <Cork> anew: you can get the height of the iframe element wrapper yes
[05:59:17] <Cork> but you can't know the size of the content of the iframe
[05:59:28] <s3d_matt> so i was going to store each 'uplift' value in a array element using the ID (or any other identifier) and then add up all the array elements
[05:59:34] <anew> so if the wrapper gets bigger or smaller i can see that
[05:59:41] <s3d_matt> when the user changes a select
[05:59:41] <seutje> unless it's same-origin, right
[05:59:47] <anew> well shit i think that's what i was doing, but in ff it shows 0
[05:59:51] <anew> in chrome it shows 61
[05:59:56] <anew> *shoot
[06:00:01] <Cork> seutje: yes
[06:00:04] <s3d_matt> Cork any ideas?
[06:00:06] * anew is out of ideas
[06:00:10] <SackyBoy> please, can someone look at this code to see why i get the html working without <!doctye html> tag, and when i use the <!doctype html> i dont get it validated in the w3c validator? jsfiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/LpXTH/
[06:00:13] <s3d_matt> anew - me too!!
[06:00:17] <anew> lol
[06:00:20] <Cork> s3d_matt: i'm trying to parse your code to your description :)
[06:00:35] <s3d_matt> Cork - thank, sorry my descriptive skills are rather - well useless
[06:00:39] <Cork> SackyBoy: have you validated the html??
[06:00:49] <seutje> SackyBoy: u have unclosed elements
[06:00:59] <Cork> SackyBoy: like i said before, if it works in quirks mode its most likely invalid
[06:01:05] <SackyBoy> cork: yeah, i have check all the elements, and everything seems okay... =/
[06:01:18] <seutje> SackyBoy: reason it does validate without the DTD is because it validates it against a very loose document type iirc
[06:01:22] <kaleb> Is it ok to ask questions about jquery mobile here?
[06:02:38] <SackyBoy> okay, i see... hmm i have tried to search and investigate the html but, as i said... everything seem to be correct XD
[06:03:50] <Cork> SackyBoy: ya, the html looks fine
[06:03:58] <Cork> SackyBoy: so what isn't working?
[06:05:36] <SackyBoy> cork: when i run it without the doctype html, a text that says "your position have been found" and a google map show up with the users position. and if i use the doctype, only the text shows up but no map... :(
[06:05:42] <Cork> s3d_matt: like i said before pricesArray[this.id] = finalPriceValue; isn't allowed for arrays
[06:05:46] <anew> last idea.. if i have <div style="height:15px"><iframe></iframe></div> if the iframe overflows out of the div (iframe height is 30 px) can i detect this ?
[06:05:51] <kaleb> I have a server which produces web content that downloads to an IOS app, now, I use jquery mobile for the stuff, but the former designer made the content go into different html files that are all loaded locally from the web view in the iPad. Now, my question is this, is it possible to get the data-transitions working when the links within index.html are in different files? I.E not build with the page attribute
[06:05:56] <Cork> s3d_matt: and i suspect thats one of the sources of your problems
[06:06:05] <s3d_matt> Cork - I don't know how else to approach it
[06:06:09] <Cork> s3d_matt: replace it with pricesArray.push(finalPriceValue);
[06:06:26] <s3d_matt> that wouldn't work if they updated the price
[06:06:33] <s3d_matt> as it needs to update the var for that
[06:06:35] <Cork> then use an object instead
[06:06:42] <Cork> var prices = {};
[06:06:47] <seutje> SackyBoy: it actually does validate o.O
[06:06:54] <Cork> prices[this.id] = finalPrice;
[06:06:59] <s3d_matt> awesome
[06:07:10] <s3d_matt> and then foreach($prices as $price) { ...
[06:07:11] <s3d_matt> ?
[06:07:17] <anew> cork last idea.. if i have <div style="height:15px"><iframe></iframe></div> if the iframe overflows out of the div (iframe height is 30 px) can i detect this ?
[06:07:20] <Cork> s3d_matt: and use $.each(prices, function(key, value) {});
[06:07:26] <SackyBoy> seutje: what do you mean? does it validate with the doctype?
[06:07:28] <s3d_matt> Cork thank ill try now
[06:07:47] <Cork> anew: no
[06:08:06] <anew> dead
[06:08:06] <Cork> well you can check if the size of the content of the div is heigher
[06:08:19] <Cork> but... ah
[06:08:19] <anew> you mean check the iframe
[06:08:26] <anew> yeah doesnt do it
[06:08:28] <Cork> you could just as well check the size of the iframe wrapper
[06:08:34] <SackyBoy> seutje: it validates with the doctype, but the map doesnt work, and if i skip using the doctype it works fine... but it doesn't validates -buhu-
[06:08:53] <anew> yeah that's the problem, checking iframe wrapper works in safari/chrome does not work in firefox/internet explorer
[06:09:13] <Cork> SackyBoy: do you get any errors in the console?
[06:09:53] <Cork> anew: the size of iframes from cross domains is tricky to handle, cause of all the security models in play
[06:10:08] <Cork> anew: normally the best thing to do is to just adapt to it
[06:10:17] <anew> yeah i got it in two brosers... maybe it is a security hole in chrome and safari then
[06:10:30] <SackyBoy> cork: if you are talking about the w3c validator, i only gets 2 warnings with the doctype.
[06:10:37] <SackyBoy> cork: do you mean another console?
[06:10:46] <Cork> SackyBoy: the browsers console
[06:10:48] <seutje> u should be able to get the dimensions of the iframe element, just not its contents
[06:10:50] <obert> only?
[06:11:05] <anew> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5021303/firefox-not-giving-right-height-within-iframe
[06:11:10] <anew> hah i actually found it's a bug in firefox
[06:11:13] <anew> well done
[06:11:16] <Cork> within ya
[06:11:20] <Cork> your not within
[06:11:29] <seutje> http://jsfiddle.net/ULQyT/ works in FF for me
[06:11:29] <obert> anew: well known bug?:p
[06:11:41] <SackyBoy> cork: lol, how do i view the browsers console? haha :)
[06:11:52] <Cork> SackyBoy: what browser?
[06:11:54] <s3d_matt> Cork - that is mostly working, however the overallTotal isn't working - new paste bin of just that bit… http://pastebin.com/Z6zv5RLF
[06:12:05] <SackyBoy> cork: safari
[06:12:27] <Cork> s3d_matt: are you sure you get numbers when you add them?
[06:12:37] <Cork> s3d_matt: i suspect you need to parse them with parseFloat()
[06:12:44] <anew> well 2 out of 4 browsers aint bad lol
[06:13:02] <anew> ok last question then i will leave you all alone lol.... can i do a click() for inside an iframe ?
[06:13:13] <Cork> SackyBoy: ugg... i'm really bad with safari, if i remember correctly you need to enable the development mode to see the menu option
[06:13:25] <Cork> SackyBoy: i think its an option in preferences
[06:13:35] <s3d_matt> Cork tried: overallTotal = overallTotal + parseFloat(value);
[06:13:45] <s3d_matt> but nadda
[06:13:52] <Cork> s3d_matt: what do you get?
[06:14:02] <SackyBoy> cork: okay, do you know how i can do it in firefox?
[06:14:06] <Cork> SackyBoy: https://developer.apple.com/library/safari/documentation/AppleApplications/Conceptual/Safari_Developer_Guide/2SafariDeveloperTools/SafariDeveloperTools.html
[06:14:21] <Cork> SackyBoy: ctrl+shift+k
[06:14:25] <seutje> yeah, it's pretty well hidden on the safaries
[06:14:38] <[E]sc> i'm trying to bind a function after an ajax success that's previously been loaded, however, when i bind it, the function gets fired in successively greater increments each time, when it's only supposed to be clicked once...is there a way around this?  http://pastebin.com/3GuW7qhW
[06:15:13] <seutje> [E]sc: ur click handler is binding a click handler?
[06:15:36] <anew> ok looks like u cant use click inside cross domain iframes
[06:15:50] <anew> well that wraps up this installment of i want to kill myself
[06:15:56] <anew> tune in tomorrow where it happens all over again
[06:16:12] <seutje> anew: u can't access the document, so obviously u can't attach or trigger events on it
[06:16:34] <anew> right, i was hoping with some zindex underneath
[06:16:39] <anew> somehow you can see if the mouse clicked that
[06:16:40] <Cork> anew: anything thats in a domtree loaded from cross domain, is off limit for you
[06:16:51] <anew> what if i overlay something underneat/above it
[06:16:53] <Cork> and events doesn't bubble from iframes
[06:17:16] <Cork> anew: you can put it ontop, but you can't have it do anything in the iframe if you do
[06:17:32] <seutje> [E]sc: ur essentially doing this: $('.wrapper').on('click', '.commentButton', function() { $('.wrapper').on('click', '.commentButton', function() { /* slidetoggle shizzle */ }); });
[06:17:32] <anew> so if i put something on top of an iframe, and click it, the iframe won't recognize it
[06:17:48] <Cork> nope
[06:17:54] <SackyBoy> cork: i got the following errors: ReferenceError: position is not defined @
[06:17:57] <Cork> cause you will grab the click, so it won't ever get to the iframe
[06:18:02] <anew> k
[06:18:11] <SackyBoy> cork: and Error when interpreting the value of the "background". Ignored declaration. @
[06:18:12] <Cork> SackyBoy: from what file?
[06:18:21] <[E]sc> seutje, i was trying to add a the toggle function i previously written to the ajax success without having to rewrite that same code again..
[06:18:26] <Cork> SackyBoy: those sounds like css warnings
[06:18:33] <SackyBoy> drom the "main" file, the one that im trying to validated
[06:18:39] <anew> ie is just a total clusterfuck
[06:18:41] <SackyBoy> from
[06:18:45] <Cork> SackyBoy: well the last one, but not the first one
[06:19:02] <Cork> SackyBoy: so your js crashes there
[06:19:05] <[E]sc> seutje, Ahh...so i'm binding a click to a click...is there another way to do what i want without having to write the same code twice?
[06:19:17] <SackyBoy> cork: okay, why? lol :)
[06:19:35] <Cork> SackyBoy: donno what line it is...
[06:20:15] <SackyBoy> cork: can i check that up in some way?
[06:20:18] <seutje> [E]sc: well, if '.wrapper' doesn't change, but ur just changing the content, u don't need to rebind
[06:20:24] <s3d_matt> Cork that worked thanks, the only issue is getting the the text for the right option/select  this.id gives me the id of the parent DIV (of the select) how do I get the text of the select bottom (which is a child of this.id)  In my head it should be this.select.text() - but doesn't work
[06:20:30] <Cork> SackyBoy: open the file and look on the line number given in the console
[06:20:45] <seutje> [E]sc: like... this should do http://pastebin.com/VLSPG79p
[06:21:01] <s3d_matt> Cork currently it does this (as original code assumes only one select:  var newPriceValue = $('.option :selected').text();
[06:21:10] <seutje> [E]sc: cause the event handler is actually bound to '.wrapper', which doesn't change :)
[06:21:23] <Cork> s3d_matt: how to get the right what??
[06:21:44] <Cork> s3d_matt: the key in the each loop is the id, if thats what you mean
[06:21:53] <s3d_matt> selected option of the select which triggered the onChange
[06:22:08] <s3d_matt> ^ Cork
[06:22:10] <Cork> $(this).val()
[06:22:17] <[E]sc> seutje, thanks.  i'll give that a try.  but what if the wrapper does change? because I am trying to append a new set of DOMs to it?
[06:22:59] <seutje> [E]sc: by change, I mean the element itself, its content doesn't matter
[06:23:42] <SackyBoy> cork: the console doesnt say what line, but it seems to be in the .js file though
[06:23:46] <seutje> [E]sc: but if it does change, set the selector higher up the DOM tree
[06:23:48] <s3d_matt> Cork - i need the child e.g. $(this.select).val() <--- which is wrong
[06:23:54] <seutje> just don't go past body :P
[06:24:03] <Cork> s3d_matt: no just $(this).val()
[06:24:08] <s3d_matt> Cork $(this).val() is returning the val of the div
[06:24:16] <Cork> if the div??
[06:24:38] <seutje> $(this).find('input, select, textarea').val()? :D
[06:25:28] <[E]sc> seutje, worked like a charm.  Thanks so much!
[06:25:41] <seutje> ^^
[06:33:20] <apeiros_> seutje: btw., it seems jquery actually does the right thing with regards to my problem. seems something else goes wrong…
[06:34:25] <Nemurenai> Grrr
[06:35:00] <Nemurenai> I have defined a $(window).resize(function(){alert("bleh")});, but for some reason it doesn't get triggered
[06:35:06] <apeiros_> seutje: http://jsfiddle.net/DSPsT/ - order of the two click events does not matter. clicking on #c will always prevent #b's handler from running
[06:35:11] <apeiros_> (which is what I wanted)
[06:35:15] <Nemurenai> I can see that the code gets loaded, and that some event in jQuery gets fired when I resize
[06:35:18] <Nemurenai> any ideas_
[06:35:19] <Nemurenai> ?
[06:40:08] <hazamonzo> Hey folks. Better way to do this simple function? http://pastebin.com/sZXMkLNg
[06:40:25] <hazamonzo> Just looking to go through an array of objects and create a new array of objects with a certain property
[06:44:03] <shesek> hazamonzo, shouldn't that be validComponents.push(obj) ?
[06:44:03] <justpie> Hey all, is it possible to override a function but still run the previous function? ie : http://jsfiddle.net/Gk2eR/
[06:44:31] <hazamonzo> shesek: probably better practise
[06:44:37] <hazamonzo> shesek: How does the rest look?
[06:44:51] <seutje> apeiros_: yeah, cause return false; works like e.preventDefault *AND* e.stopPropagation
[06:44:51] <shesek> hazamonzo, your current code would set validComponents to the last valid component, not to all of them
[06:44:55] <shesek> is that what you want?
[06:45:16] <seutje> apeiros_: u can also prevent other handlers on the same element to run by calling e.stopImmediatePropagation
[06:45:32] <shesek> if you do need an array of all the valid components, and not just the last one, you can do dbComponentsArr.filter(function(o) { return obj.type == "cccPieChart"; }) instead
[06:45:43] <hazamonzo> shesek: No no you're right. I want to create an array of objects that have a obj.type == "blah"
[06:45:44] <pachet> justpie: there are several ways to do it, but im not sure what exactly you mean by override
[06:45:48] <shesek> or with jQuery's $.filter if you want to be ES4-compatible
[06:45:53] <pachet> typically you just store a reference to the original function
[06:45:55] <shesek> ES3, that is
[06:45:58] <pachet> and call it from within the overriding function
[06:46:01] <hazamonzo> shesek: Yes! Thats even better!
[06:46:08] <hazamonzo> I was looking at $.find()
[06:46:11] <hazamonzo> didn't look right
[06:46:13] <apeiros_> seutje: ah, that last bit is interesting
[06:46:17] <hazamonzo> Filter is what i want :)
[06:46:23] <apeiros_> (immediatePropagation)
[06:47:05] <seutje> apeiros_: like $('.foo').on('click', function(e) { e.stopImmediatePropagation(); }).on('click', function() { /* I won't be called */ });
[06:47:30] <seutje> absolutely no practical use in that example, but I hope it helps illustrate the point
[06:47:49] <shesek> hazamonzo, ah, sorry
[06:47:57] <shesek> its called $.grep() in jQuery
[06:48:02] <justpie> pachet : Im not sure how to describe it. I would like to add code to the init function (in my example : supercool) without modifying the plugin itself
[06:48:02] <apeiros_> seutje: yeah, I think I understood its purpose
[06:48:26] <hazamonzo> shesek: Ahh right. i thought i had seen filter before
[06:48:42] <shesek> I haven't used jQuery's utilities (in favor of native ES5 functionality and underscore) in a while now :)
[06:49:01] <shesek> jQuery doesn't have $.filter, but it does have $.fn.filter which is used to filter DOM elements by a selector
[06:49:13] <shesek> i.e. on $(...).filter(...)
[06:49:19] <hazamonzo> right right
[06:49:56] <apeiros_> seutje: ok, my problem was that the handler crashed, and the other handler changed the site so I never saw the error :)
[06:52:12] <jacta> how can I hit all the titles -> http://jsfiddle.net/T3SxG/
[06:52:59] <Ortund> Cork, I'm confused... Here's the rendered html, styles, and jquery regarding the mouseover events... http://jsfiddle.net/a3fRM/ ... it works on the fiddle, but not on my page
[06:54:33] <seutje> apeiros_: oh yeah, love those
[06:54:38] <jacta> can anyone help? o_O
[06:54:40] <Ortund> oh no... it doesn't work in the fiddle... the jhbw div is supposed to be hidden by default
[06:57:07] <illmat> jacta: give them a class?
[06:57:20] <jacta> illmat, without a class, aint possible?
[06:57:58] <illmat> check if text contains title*
[06:58:26] <jacta> illmat, its not always containing title .\
[06:58:33] <jacta> but its the first level, if you understand
[06:58:40] <illmat> yeah just thought that ^^
[06:59:31] <illmat> $("ul > li")
[06:59:54] <illmat> ah stupid me, still wrong ^^
[07:01:16] <jacta> illmat, yes :\
[07:02:15] <Ortund> lol illmat, speaking of still wrong... I'm trying to make this display another div when you hover over the icons that appear after you hover over the bar at page load http://jsfiddle.net/a3fRM/1/
[07:02:36] <Ortund> the first hover's been working for some time, but the hover on the icon just won't display the div
[07:06:33] <jacta> Anyone? :(
[07:06:43] <jacta> thanks for trying to help illmat, didnt know it was that hard
[07:11:41] <jacta> illmat, it was possible to add class, canu help now? http://jsfiddle.net/T3SxG/3/
[07:13:19] <illmat> jacta: what do you wanna do with the titles?

[07:16:57] <s3d_matt> any ideas?
[07:17:49] <shesek> s3d_matt, .val() for the selected <option>'s value
[07:17:58] <shesek> .find('option:selected').text() for its contents
[07:18:03] <s3d_matt> that trurn the value no?
[07:18:17] <s3d_matt> ahh
[07:18:29] <s3d_matt> can you loop though all of them within a certain div
[07:18:49] <s3d_matt> e..g find all selected items indeside <div class='inhere'>

[07:21:29] <bytephilia> responsive slider?
[07:21:57] <ryuhamayoshi> I'm trying to find() checkboxes that are checked in $this (=form post)
[07:22:08] <ryuhamayoshi> but it can't find any checkboxes
[07:22:10] <ryuhamayoshi> in IE
[07:22:38] <s3d_matt> shesek so something like: $('.inhere option:selected').each(function() {   // code }
[07:22:39] <Ortund> ryuhamayoshi wouldn't looping through the checkboxes also work?
[07:22:51] <ryuhamayoshi> nope
[07:23:00] <ryuhamayoshi> it doesn't detect the checkboxes in the form
[07:23:11] <ryuhamayoshi> and that's only the case in IE
[07:23:20] <zrzerenato> i have a login page, thats poups-up a dialog box (jalert), there is how i set time for this? example, if the user and pass correct it stay 2 sec. else dialogbox stands until user click tryagain
[07:24:36] <geiregjo> Does anyone know what kind of events are triggered when you trigger an alert in a window?
[07:24:38] <zrzerenato> my question was clear? sorry iam a beginner
[07:24:49] <Ortund> ryuhamayoshi this wouldn't work? -> $(form input[type=checkbox]").each(function() { if ($(this).checked()) { // do something if it's checked } else { // do something else } });
[07:25:16] <geiregjo> I have a bug that is fixed by putting an alert in the code. It's not a bug related to resource loading because I tried to delay the behaviour that invokes the bug.
[07:25:39] <geiregjo> It allways works If a put an alert in there so I figured it might be some focus issue.
[07:26:24] <ryuhamayoshi> let's see :)
[07:26:55] <geiregjo> So i'm trying to figure out what kind of actions are executed when you trigger an alert.
[07:27:30] <Ortund> ryuhamayoshi I missed the first " in the selector just FYI
[07:27:51] <Ortund> also, not sure if .checked is a valid method call for checkboxes
[07:27:57] <pachet> gieregjo: i doubt its an issue with an event
[07:28:01] <pachet> sounds just like a typical race case
[07:29:20] <geiregjo> Can you explain what you mean?
[07:29:59] <ryuhamayoshi> not working
[07:30:06] <ryuhamayoshi> Ortund
[07:31:11] <Ortund> ryuhamayoshi well, it was just a guess on my part...
[07:32:09] <sahbeewah> ryuhamayoshi, given $this is the form: $this.find('input:checked')
[07:32:41] <geiregjo> pachet, can you explain what you mean to me
[07:34:01] <AusME> I'm considering upgrading the JQuery and JQueryUI version in an app I work on which is quite large (>100 links). I'm afraid of what changes might occur, and what glitches might be introduced. Does anyone know of any automated testing software which could ease my pain in this process?
[07:34:05] <pachet> geiregjo: typically when people say 'i fixed it by putting in an alert', they have a concurrency issue
[07:34:29] <pachet> where you see it a lot is people saying, hey, my object doesnt have the correct prop values
[07:34:33] <pachet> but if i put in an alert, it does!
[07:34:46] <geiregjo> ic
[07:34:48] <geiregjo> k
[07:34:52] <geiregjo> it's an Ipad issue
[07:34:52] <pachet> meaning that at that state in your application's control flow, it does, and they're just unaware of what's causing that object to be updated later
[07:35:06] <pachet> i'd need to see some code to be more help
[07:36:09] <geiregjo> I think I understand what you mean. I can't share alot of code with you.
[07:36:17] <mfranz> Quick question as I am sure I am doing something very simple wrong, but the googling hasn't helped, I am doing an ajax call to php page and return data, that all works but when the data is returned it is suppose to redirect to different div to load a new "page" data-role which it does but it shows the home page just before the redirect for about 1/2 a second, I have tried async: false but that
[07:36:17] <mfranz> seems to break the data return, is there something simple I have forgotten
[07:36:49] <geiregjo> I'm only having the issue on safari touch browsers. They have an issue with sharing a websocket connection over multiple tabs/windows.
[07:37:21] <sacho> mfranz, clarify what you mean "it is supposed to redirect to a different div"
[07:38:01] <mfranz> so I have the $.ajax stuff, then on success I have this: $.mobile.changePage("#add_mrn_page"); which works
[07:38:14] <mfranz> but there is a div in the index.html called id=home
[07:38:21] <mfranz> which it shows first before the redirect
[07:38:27] <mfranz> it is like it is refreshing the home div
[07:38:29] <mfranz> then redirecting
[07:38:33] * sacho shrugs
[07:38:33] <b-ot> sacho: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[07:38:39] <mfranz> I'd like to avoid the redirect
[07:38:42] <sacho> I don't know what jquery mobile does.
[07:38:43] <mfranz> err
[07:38:44] <mfranz> the refrest
[07:39:02] <mfranz> for form submit should I be using
[07:39:16] <mfranz> .ajaxForm
[07:40:06] <mfranz> I have tried a return false after the ajax call but then the redirect fails
[07:45:13] <_|Nix|_> mfranz: Have you tried to preventDefault on pagebeforechange?
[07:45:47] <mfranz> No.  I'll try that now
[07:46:00] <_|Nix|_> mfranz: preventDefault on the pagebeforechange that is automatic, and allow the pagebeforechange on your redirect to go through.
[07:49:48] <ladislaw> I forget the name of the widget that you can slide from option to option
[07:49:53] <ladislaw> verically
[07:50:07] <mikehenriquez> hello guys, i have a problem with .prev() and .next(), they won't returns me the attr('name') of the previous or next element in my list, any idea?
[07:53:23] <Jabberwock> Hi guys :)
[07:53:44] <Jabberwock> Does anyone know of a work-around for jQuery Mobile input[type=range] and jQuery Validation?
[07:54:07] <Jabberwock> The validation plugin always invalidates the range input as long as there is a min and max attribute…which defeats the purpose of having one
[07:54:18] <Jabberwock> (and brb, sorry)
[07:55:59] <Croves> Hello guys, I'm having a litle problem with Flotcharts. The background and labels are generated, but the pie chart won't. My code is: http://pastebin.com/U6fMgHWK
[07:56:11] <p3lim> Anyone know if there is a channel for SWFObject?
[07:56:24] <Jabberwock> People still use Flash!?
[07:56:51] <p3lim> As in, I'm hacking around with the youtube flash player, so I have some questions :)
[07:57:34] <Jabberwock> p3lim: /msg alis list *swf*
[07:57:57] <p3lim> What/who is alis?
[07:58:55] <Jabberwock> alis is a freenode service bot
[08:02:41] <Croves> DAmn, I wasn't loading the pie lib
[08:02:51] <Croves> Sorry guys =(
[08:03:42] <juboba> has somebody used ajaxForm before?
[08:04:04] <juboba> http://www.malsup.com/jquery/form/
[08:16:20] <tdignan> yes
[08:16:52] <tdignan> it's pretty easy to use. all you really actually need to do is call ajaxForm() and implement a success callback..
[08:17:30] <Jabberwock> No one else having issues with jQuery Validation and input[type=range] ?
[08:17:36] <Jabberwock> I've gotta get this working
[08:18:18] <grafi> ,
[08:18:42] <Jabberwock> grafi: THAT DOESN'T HELP ME!
[08:18:45] <Jabberwock> you rascal.
[08:19:37] <Jabberwock> Also jQuery Mobile makes the range input look weird
[08:19:41] <grafi> your are probably having troubles because type=range isnt supported by all browsers? at least i think ...
[08:19:53] <Jabberwock> The counter is on top of the gutter, and so is the slider
[08:20:12] <Jabberwock> It is in Safari/IOS
[08:20:14] <Jabberwock> And Chrome
[08:20:17] <Jabberwock> (at least)
[08:20:30] <Jabberwock> The jQuery Validation plugin always says it's invalid
[08:22:26] <Jabberwock> Interesting.. JQM converts it to input[type=number]
[08:22:37] <mikehenriquez> guys any of you can give me light creating an index for a <li>
[08:22:38] <mikehenriquez> ??
[08:23:03] <Jabberwock> $('<li/>').appendTo(someElement);
[08:23:16] <Jabberwock> wait I misunderstood the Q
[08:23:29] <mikehenriquez> this is what i have
[08:23:29] <mikehenriquez> http://hsinteractivo.com/visa/
[08:23:30] <Jabberwock> Can you rephrase that?
[08:23:40] <mikehenriquez> i need to get the currentIndex of the li
[08:23:57] <mikehenriquez> in order to change the class to the next() or prev() element
[08:24:10] <Jabberwock> oh… http://api.jquery.com/index/
[08:24:56] <mfranz> so I think I have a more consise question:
[08:24:57] <mfranz> I have 3 div's <div id="a"> <div id="b"> <div id="c"> in one html doc.  After ajax submit on success i have $.mobile.changepage("c");  however on change it quickly shows div a and b before landing on c
[08:25:09] <sacho> mikehenriquez, list items don't have a "current index"
[08:25:28] <mfranz> all of the internet examples don't involve form submits and I think that is what is causing the issue
[08:25:33] <Jabberwock> ? fouc
[08:25:35] <mikehenriquez> sacho: but there's a way or a hack that i can do to store the current image?
[08:25:39] <Jabberwock> ?? fouc
[08:25:42] <Jabberwock> What's the bot syntax
[08:25:49] <sacho> mikehenriquez, if you want to *select* a specific list item(in order to go to the previous or next element via next() or prev()), then that's a different story.
[08:25:56] <sacho> mikehenriquez, I don't really know what you mean.
[08:26:01] <mikehenriquez> http://hsinteractivo.com/visa/
[08:26:07] <Jabberwock> mfranz: You're experiencing FOUC (Flash of Unstyled Content) ?
[08:26:14] <mikehenriquez> i need to change the class to the next or previous image
[08:26:38] <mfranz> YES
[08:26:41] <mikehenriquez> i already can change the class to the prev or next <li>, but i need to continue with that pattern
[08:26:53] <mikehenriquez> changing the class to the next or previous image in the rotator
[08:26:54] <mfranz> well actually it is also styled but it is the WRONG div
[08:27:06] <mfranz> that loads briefly then is transitioned to the correct div
[08:27:20] <Jabberwock> mfranz: Out of blatant curiosity - what if you do location.href='#c'; instead of using the $.mobile way?
[08:27:36] <Jabberwock> I haven't experienced what you're describing personalluy
[08:27:39] <Jabberwock> personally
[08:28:23] <mfranz> trying now
[08:28:32] <Jabberwock> Or $.mobile.changePage($("#c"), "slide", true, true);
[08:31:09] <mfranz> actually it is unstyled
[08:31:22] <mfranz> and the location.href('#c') didn't work either
[08:34:31] <Jabberwock> Perhaps ask in irc://irc.freenode.net:6667/#jquery-mobile 
[08:34:54] <Jabberwock> N/m paul_irish is the only guy there.

[08:35:49] <Jabberwock> Poor guy.. has to work at Google.
[08:35:55] <Jabberwock> Oh. The topic says they moved support to this channel
[08:36:12] <grafi> [16:35:45] <Jabberwock> Poor guy.. has to work at Google. << yeah must be horrible oô
[08:36:36] <Jabberwock> I know! I mean you have enclosed meditation machines, slides from one floor to another...
[08:36:41] <Jabberwock> Must be tough.

[08:40:08] <grafi> Walt Disney Parks & Resorts Online brings the magic online. Want to work for us? Your future is just a mouse click away.
[08:40:17] <grafi> thats a nice slogan

[08:40:54] <Jabberwock> It really is a great place to work.
[08:41:01] <Jabberwock> Been there most of the past 5 years
[08:41:08] <Jabberwock> Except a brief layoff as a contractor when I went to EA
[08:41:19] <Jabberwock> I have no idea why my range input looks like this with JQM: https://dl.dropbox.com/u/21973043/Screen%20Shot%202013-03-14%20at%2011.40.06%20AM.png
[08:42:03] <ravenz> custom padding?
[08:42:12] <ravenz> ?demo @ Jabberwock
[08:42:12] <b-ot> Jabberwock: Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[08:43:05] <grafi> Jabberwock: now animate the ball so it jumps up and down on the line :D
[08:43:15] <Jabberwock> That'd be cool
[08:43:29] <grafi> totally
[08:44:10] <tomasm-> hi, I'm having a problem calling jquery.post() inside a loop, where I need to pass a few variables to the response function (which gets its own html, not json), and I'm guessing because of async issues, the variables it has at the time is perhaps the wrong values. since jquery.post is being called inside a loop where the vars are set. not sure how to ensure vars are passed or not
[08:44:31] <Rainb> Where can one discuss about the methods of jQuery.
[08:45:14] <ravenz> Rainb here is fine I guess
[08:45:29] <Jabberwock> ravenz: no custom padding. The only CSS I have is the JQM css, and normalize.css from HTML5BP which does nothing if I remove it
[08:45:37] <Jabberwock> Working on the fiddle.
[08:45:57] <ravenz> tomasm- do you have a link?
[08:46:08] <derik> how i automatically "click" an item when the page loads ?
[08:46:10] <ravenz> Jabberwock link?
[08:46:19] <tomasm-> ravenz, no, not really....
[08:46:22] <ravenz> ?trigger @ derik
[08:46:22] <b-ot> derik: broadcasting an event out
[08:46:48] <ravenz> tomasm- can you create a testcase?
[08:49:14] <tomasm-> ravenz, http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1552941/how-does-a-function-in-a-loop-which-returns-another-function-work
[08:49:33] <Jabberwock> ravenz: https://github.com/b146432/MDVBS/tree/gh-pages/MIU/behan_michael_project2/Gold is the code
[08:49:57] <tomasm-> that is basically my issue, and I found a solution there.... to wrap everything in a "closure" that passes a variable through... kinda like (function($) { })(jQuery)
[08:51:01] <ravenz> tomasm- seems to be a different question
[08:51:07] <Woet> is it possible to have a fading background-image?
[08:51:10] <fuchstronaut> using slideUp() causes the sliding element to lose all css styling before the animation starts
[08:51:20] <ravenz> I'll be back to you with an explaination in few seconds tough
[08:51:21] <fuchstronaut> is this a common problem or am i doing it wrong?
[08:51:27] <ravenz> a link actually :P
[08:53:04] <Rainb> Gotcha
[08:53:07] <Rainb> Thanks
[08:53:50] <ravenz> tomasm- http://youtu.be/ya4UHuXNygM?t=1h6m14s you may want to read about closures in general (or watch the whole video)
[08:55:02] <ravenz> Jabberwock I can have a look at it later at home, I have to go now sorry
[08:55:13] <Jabberwock> No worries. I appreciate your help
[08:56:10] <p3lim> Anyone with some experience with the youtube player API that might tell me why this is not working? http://pastebin.com/zwQLYebd
[08:56:21] <p3lim> Basically the event never fires
[08:56:27] <mikehenriquez> hey guys, can i get the index of a <li> by find('img').attr('name)???
[08:56:46] <hazamonzo> hmm, not sure whats wrong with the commented out logic.. http://pastebin.com/nwvpj865 i thought i could pass over an array to check if the value exists instead of a statif list in the condition. Thoughts?
[08:57:20] <Jabberwock> mikehenriquez: http://wddbs.com/jshero/ ?
[08:57:41] <mikehenriquez> Jabberwock are u in fullsail?

[08:59:57] <mikehenriquez> awesome
[09:00:14] <mikehenriquez> send me your contact
[09:00:19] <Jabberwock> Yeah digging this one. The previous ones were kind of annoying because it's all stuff I've been doing for a living
[09:00:33] <Jabberwock> What's your linked in page if you have one?
[09:00:44] <Jabberwock> http://www.linkedin.com/in/michaelbehan
[09:00:47] <mikehenriquez> i work at the biggest newspaper in Puerto Rico and they always looking for android or iOS developers
[09:00:54] <Jabberwock> Nice!
[09:00:58] <norm> is there a good on-step way to replace all the elements in a list with a fresh list? or should i just empty the list and append the new elements
[09:01:18] <Ice_Black> http://arshaw.com/fullcalendar does not allow to see full year calenders - do you know any other addon that is similar but full year with all the month on a page
[09:01:57] <Jabberwock> norm: Really depends on the context of what you're looking to achieve
[09:03:01] <norm> Jabberwock: i have list of elements that belong in a particular container. i can replace them if they already exist or append them if absent. or i could clear out all the existing elements and just append the new list
[09:03:22] <norm> neither seems particularly clean
[09:03:27] <Jabberwock> I think the later will be the most straight forward
[09:03:34] <norm> yeah
[09:08:19] <djQuery> norm have you thought about using a framework such as knockout.js
[09:08:57] <norm> djQuery: i've looked at a handful (ember / knockout / etc)
[09:09:22] <norm> djQuery: my fear is that it binds me to exactly how it requires things to be done
[09:10:09] <norm> djQuery: and i'll have some business case for something outside of the library's capabilities
[09:10:50] <norm> i'm using backbone.js at the moment, i like that it's so lightweight and flexible
[09:11:31] <djQuery> wish I could find tuts comparable to knockouts for backbone
[09:12:16] <norm> i've been very happy with backbone
[09:12:19] <sacho> norm, what you generally do is diff->remove->add
[09:12:31] <norm> the hardest part about learning backbone is realizing that there's just not that much to it
[09:12:44] <sacho> so there's no trivial "one-step" way
[09:13:00] <sacho> except what you said(replacing the list with a new one)
[09:13:06] <norm> sacho: yeah, just replacing the whole list works for now. if i need to optimize later, i can :)
[09:15:23] <Anticom> how do i select/unselect an input[type=checkbox] ?
[09:16:45] <norm> Anticom: .attr("checked", true/false)
[09:16:54] <Anticom> cheers
[09:17:15] <Anticom> argh
[09:17:24] <Anticom> i meant [type=radio] ._.
[09:17:26] <Anticom> sry
[09:17:49] <norm> .attr("selected") on the desired option tag
[09:18:03] <norm> you're just manipulating html attributes
[09:19:29] <Anticom> just wondering why it doesn't show up in fb
[09:33:08] <Anticom> $.work('done', true);
[09:33:10] <Anticom> window.close;
[09:33:11] <Anticom> :D
[09:33:12] <Anticom> bb
[09:38:32] <Jabberwock> I was using an older JQM CSS with 1.3.0
[09:38:43] <Jabberwock> Now I'm using the 1.3.0 CSS and all the icons have disappeared :/
[09:41:26] <dogarrhea> is there nothing that allows me to see which event handlers are attached to a particular element? say i want to see if a text type event is attached to a text area
[09:41:35] <Jabberwock> n/m
[09:41:49] <grafi> Jabberwock: PANIC!
[09:41:51] <grafi> :D
[09:41:58] <NoiseEee> dogarrhea: chrome can give you some idea in its inspector if you highlight the element
[09:42:30] <Jabberwock> Negative good buddy!
[09:43:02] <dcherman> dogarrhea: is this just for debugging purposes?
[09:43:19] <dogarrhea> NoiseEee: it doesn't really give that much helpful info though. i don't know where the function that handles the event actually is from that info heh
[09:43:26] <dogarrhea> yes dcherman
[09:43:37] <dogarrhea> i think a textarea is being resized when the user types something
[09:43:41] <dcherman> dogarrhea: $._data( elem, "events" )
[09:43:52] <dcherman> that's an unsupported interface though, don't use it for code beyond debugging.
[09:45:10] <vacho> is it possible to make a function that makes an ajax call and returns the result of the ajax call?
[09:45:11] <dogarrhea> $._data( "txtInput_input", "events" ) TypeError: Object function bound(var_args) { return func.apply(thisObject, args.concat(slice(arguments))); } has no method '_data'
[09:45:29] <dogarrhea> doh
[09:45:53] <dogarrhea> i keep forgetting. we aren't allowed to use any javascript libraries because we are 3rd party advertising and if we do, we risk overwriting our client's own libraries
[09:48:32] <NoiseEee> dogarrhea: and the problem you're trying to solve is...
[09:48:38] <vacho> ajpiano :)
[09:48:44] <vacho> ajpiano the guru
[09:48:51] <dogarrhea> noiseeee, finding out what the event handlers are for a particular element
[09:49:00] <NoiseEee> dogarrhea: for what purpose.
[09:49:07] <NoiseEee> dogarrhea: what is that letting you solve?
[09:49:31] <dogarrhea> to determine if the computed width of the element is being explicitly modified in javascript or not because ie8 does weird stuff
[09:49:46] <dogarrhea> whenever i type something into a textarea, it's computed width changes
[09:49:56] <dogarrhea> only on IE8
[09:50:16] <dogarrhea> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKNFCMZf6xY&feature=youtu.be
[09:51:47] <dogarrhea> sorry about the low quality.  you'll see the inspected element's width change in the video. that's all i wanted to show
[09:53:42] <porton> There is a list of items, wtith
[09:55:09] <porton> There is a list of items, with each items is associated several data fields. When the title of an item is clicked opens a "miniform" (editor of the fields associated with the item). When user clicks submit, all items with their data are submitted. What is the best way to implement this?
[09:55:18] <NoiseEee> well dogarrhea afaik there is no way to identify listeners on elements, sadly.
[09:55:32] <dogarrhea> bleh
[09:55:38] <vacho> is it possible to make a function that makes an ajax call and returns the result of the ajax call? sorry for repeating :)
[09:55:59] <porton> vacho: Essentially no, because AJAX is asynchronous
[09:56:15] <dogarrhea> is it possible that computed width of a textarea changes without any javascript whatsoever?
[09:56:30] <dogarrhea> just from a user interacting with it (it's not resizeable)
[09:56:36] <vacho> porton: yes, that's the problem I am having .... so how do I get around this?
[09:56:49] <porton> vacho: Write a callback handler
[09:58:45] <justpie> Hey all, Would anyone happen to know why jquery toggle only works after the second click?
[09:59:09] <vacho> lead me in the right direction sire'
[09:59:18] <porton> ... If that were a real form, I would have form.reset() to cancel changes in "miniform", but it isn't, I should store it programmatically. What is the shortest code to do this?
[09:59:41] <porton> vacho: see documentation of $.post()
[10:00:37] <dblosevn> Hey guys, quick question, I have a fancybox using the iframe method that loads content cross domain, it is my understanding that the frame is not able to access the parent window, but this is not true in my case. Jquery is loaded in the parent as well as the iframe, within the iframe jquery-mobile is loaded to when trying to close a jQm dialog it chages window.top.href and navigates back, how
[10:00:37] <dblosevn> can i prevent that behavior and allow the dialog to close
[10:01:01] <justpie> Heres my code : http://jsfiddle.net/R6hEA/ Jquery toggle not working on first click. Any ideas?
[10:01:23] <porton> Does .serialize() work for elements outside of any form?
[10:01:45] <dblosevn> .serialize is a method for forms
[10:02:12] <dblosevn> serializeArray works on other objects
[10:02:25] <dblosevn> ?jquery.seralizeArray @ porton
[10:02:25] <porton> dblosevn: Will it work if I create a <form> without any attributes (or maybe just 'id' attr)?
[10:02:28] <bot-t> dblosevn, Couldn't find "jquery.seralizeArray" in jQuery Docs.
[10:03:07] <dblosevn> ya i usually just add a form tag <form method="post" action="#"> so it meets w3c requirements
[10:03:22] <dblosevn> keeping in mind you cant nest form tags
[10:04:24] <porton> dblosevn: Wrong: "Note that serializeArray() only works on form elements, using this method on another element will not work"
[10:06:49] <porton> Is there a "de-serialize" method which fills values of form controls from a given single value?
[10:10:45] <vacho> can someone help me write a function that makes an ajax call and returns the result of the ajax call? I know this is generally not possible but I am sure there's a way?
[10:12:16] <systemfault> Only by doing evil things..
[10:12:29] <vacho> systemfault: as long as I am not hurting anyone?
[10:12:52] <systemfault> You could… if your server lags, you could freeze your client's browser.
[10:13:26] <systemfault> Look for the async config option of $.ajax
[10:14:12] <systemfault> If you set it to false, you can do a synchonous HTTP call… unfortunately, since JS is single-threaded, it could freeze your user's browser for a moment.
[10:14:30] <theotherguy> hi guys
[10:14:41] <theotherguy> what's the best way to pass in this in here? http://pastie.org/pastes/6495375/text
[10:14:44] <theotherguy> from outside
[10:15:46] <vacho> systemfault: I don't know if I am OK with a browser freezing for a sec.
[10:15:50] <systemfault> theotherguy: With JS, you can access variables from the outer scope without browser
[10:16:00] <vacho> systemfault: im gonna go back to DOJO, tired of jQuery
[10:16:28] <systemfault> vacho: No problem… DOJO is still bound by the rules of the browser though..
[10:16:45] <vacho> systemfault: hehe, just joking..never used dojo..is it even good?
[10:17:12] <systemfault> vacho: Never used it, I only used YUI3/Mootools/jQuery
[10:17:18] <systemfault> (And pure DOM… of course)
[10:17:52] <snover> yes, but it is not a dom helper library, so if that is all you need, don’t use it
[10:18:01] <vacho> worth looking into YUI3 and Mootools?
[10:18:11] <theotherguy> systemfault: inside $.getJSON 's callback this is referring to jQuery object, but I want to reference to some other this
[10:18:14] <snover> no
[10:18:51] <systemfault> vacho: Depends… I think they're nicer than jQuery but their communities isn't that great, so is the amount of available plugins.
[10:19:50] <systemfault> (I sooo love the YUI3 guys, they're all great guys and the devs themselves answer the questions)
[10:20:21] <vacho> systemfault: ok cool, thanks for the info.
[10:22:15] <porton> What is the best way to "decode" an URI string like "a=1&b=2" -> {a:1, b:2}?

[10:29:32] <terinjokes> if a UI Widget extends another UI widget, do the options of both get merged?
[10:29:43] <terinjokes> or do I need to manually merge myself?

[10:30:53] <xiphiasx_> whenever i click on anything on the listview when starting a new order
[10:31:01] <ladislaw> any tutorials on radio button toggle switch?
[10:31:17] <xiphiasx_> it'll work, until you switch to "cold" or "hot", and play with it there
[10:31:38] <systemfault> ladislaw: What do you mean? Toggle switching is the whole point of radio buttons
[10:32:29] <ladislaw> I mean with effect like http://freebiesdesign.com/5-jquery-toggle-switch-plugins/#.UUH-iRxKLsw
[10:32:42] <ladislaw> but with a neutral option in the middle

[10:59:13] <scalex000> terinjokes yes
[10:59:23] <terinjokes> smart1: is it not at http://jqueryui.com/themeroller/ ?
[11:00:01] <smart1> <terinjokes>:no, the tool was just the tool itself,not with the preview ...
[11:01:51] <scalex000> terinjokes, im doing almost the same example from the jquery ui website
[11:02:15] <Nancy2012>  is it not possible to pass 2 different div ids on .click event
[11:02:35] <Nancy2012> I m passing múltiple id on my jquery función but it wouldnt work  $('#hastabtn, #chastabtn').click(function() { $('#hasta').datepicker('show');});
[11:02:38] <Nancy2012> like this..
[11:03:09] <dcherman> Nancy2012: that's valid.
[11:03:41] <Nancy2012> so it ll work

[11:08:28] <mikehenriquez_> i try prev() but if I'm at the position 0 of my index, i can't go to the last one
[11:10:46] <NoiseEee> mikehenriquez: "go back in the index of the li" means what
[11:11:41] <mikehenriquez> NoiseEee: if i start my <li> at position 0, i want to go the the last item in the list

[11:17:56] <BaNzounet> Hey, Is it possible to do something like $('#foo*'); where * can be anynumber?
[11:18:27] <mikehenriquez> NoiseEee: can i use get() with dynamic values?
[11:18:39] <NoiseEee> BaNzounet: no, and it speaks of you using IDs incorrectly where perhaps classes or data- attributes would fit better
[11:18:50] <NoiseEee> mikehenriquez: you can use it to get any item in a collection, yes
[11:19:11] <mikehenriquez> can i pm you for a second?
[11:19:28] <mikehenriquez> or you prefer here?
[11:19:58] <zfly9> ^^ for my question above http://jsfiddle.net/6rhRd/
[11:20:22] <NoiseEee> BaNzounet: you could do something like $('[id^="foo"]') but again, it speaks of an underlying semantic issue
[11:20:32] <NoiseEee> mikehenriquez: here so others can help while i'm doing my paid work
[11:20:55] <mikehenriquez> NoiseEee: ok no problem thanks anyways :D
[11:21:55] <vacho> how can I get the ID of this element? [object HTMLTableRowElement]
[11:23:06] <NoiseEee> vacho: how did you get the element?
[11:23:33] <zfly9> anyone?
[11:23:38] <systemfault> vacho: .id
[11:24:07] <vacho> NoiseEee: I get it in a plugin function
[11:24:08] <systemfault> vacho: Or you could jQuery-ify it and use .attr('id') or even .prop('id')
[11:24:30] <kamo> if I want to disable Double CLick on all buttons on a page, what would be the best way to do this?

[11:28:41] <fonko> it should iterate through newBg[0], newBg[1], newBg[]
[11:29:06] <fonko> it should iterate through newBg[0], newBg[1], newBg[2]... and when is going to be 3 i set it to 0 again.... still isn't working propperly

[11:33:35] <defaultro> hey guys, what do you use for tracking your site and visitors?
[11:34:05] <anew> i use piwik
[11:34:15] <anew> but if it gets super big i dont htink piwik can do it
[11:34:20] <defaultro> oh ok
[11:34:41] <anew> super big = like 40k visitors a day
[11:34:53] <anew> other than that it's much better than google analytics imo
[11:34:55] <defaultro> our application is big. We are using webtrekk and mgmt would like to use another one
[11:35:04] <defaultro> ok
[11:35:19] <anew> how many visitors a day u getting ?
[11:35:39] <defaultro> i'll have to check
[11:36:07] <defaultro> maybe 2000-3000 a day
[11:36:39] <defaultro> i heard from the other team, they are using omniture. Not sure how good it is
[11:37:11] <defaultro> I also remember, I saw webtrekk codes on 101 files
[11:38:03] <defaultro> can piwik work on php and javascript?
[11:38:47] <Guddu> Dear friends...I am trying to change the body background image when the content of a select box changes to a particular value. To this effect, i wrote this piece of code at http://dpaste.com/1022990/  but somehow the background image does not change dynamically. Please guide.
[11:38:47] <defaultro> looks like with Piwik, I can install it on our webserver
[11:39:00] <zfly9> $('.cssSelector > .childSelector') <-- is that ok or do I have it worng?
[11:39:12] <zfly9> do the quotes go around each?
[11:41:16] <docmur> I'm trying to get this code: http://jsfiddle.net/tZ4w6/  to listen to the enter key so I don't need a submit on the form, it's not working.  Can anyone see what I'm doing wrong?
[11:50:59] <NoiseEee> docmur: nothing matches '#postForm input'
[11:52:44] <NoiseEee> http://jsfiddle.net/tZ4w6/1/ @ docmur   also basic validation stuff like closing brackets.
[11:52:50] <zfly9> $('.cssSelector > .childSelector') <-- is that ok or do I have it worng?
[11:55:04] <Guddu> I added a background image to a div and using chrome inspector I can see that the background-image property is set. The image however does not show up. What could be the reaon? This is what my element looks like  <div id="logo_container" style="background-image: url(http://127.0.0.1:8999/static_mimansa_apps//images/logo/Logo_P.png);"></div>
[11:56:57] <Guddu> Is it because the DIV is empty?
[11:57:18] <grafi> could be

[11:57:30] <scalex000> how to remove the close button from dialog,  show not align im using lightness css
[11:57:36] <GoGoGarrett> I've never experienced any thing similar to this, any ideas?
[11:58:15] <Guddu> grafi, Is there a way to have the DIV size itself based on the image size?
[11:58:52] <grafi> not if its a background-image i dont think
[12:01:52] <Guddu> grafi, shall i use IMG then?
[12:02:30] <grafi> depends on what you want to achieve i guess
[12:02:54] <zfly9> Hey guys I have this http://jsfiddle.net/6rhRd/1/ and it's adding the class like I want but not removing it as I would like.. I think I need to make the css selector specific to the active item.. any help??
[12:03:02] <grafi> there must be a reason why you chose background-image?
[12:03:22] <Guddu> grafi, I want the image to be shown in its original form. With a empty div, the image doe snot show at all
[12:04:19] <grafi> well if you just want to show the image, why not use img from the start?
[12:07:22] <grafi> zfly9 you are adding the active class to every div within .slideshow
[12:07:34] <grafi> thats probably not what you want
[12:08:49] <dcherman> GoGoGarrett: what issue is that causing for you?  that's a property that jquery is setting on nodes as needed, however IE treats properties as attributes.
[12:09:15] <zfly9> right, how can I change that
[12:09:20] <zfly9> trying to learn as I go
[12:10:04] <NoiseEee> Guddu: learn css.
[12:10:40] <Guddu> NoiseEee, Thanks I am on it. Just figured out that empty DIV cannot show background image. I used IMG tag and things look good....I love JQuery
[12:11:55] <grafi> directly unrelated
[12:15:26] <zfly9> grafi?
[12:16:41] <clone1018> Hey there, I'm looking for a jQuery image overlay plugin, think overlaying stickers on an image, anyone know of one?
[12:17:56] <GoGoGarrett> dcherman: it's not adding classes correctly.  I'm trying to do $(this).addClas('active') where this would be the LI
[12:17:59] <GoGoGarrett> and.. no classes are added
[12:18:30] <grafi> zfly9 http://api.jquery.com/eq/ http://api.jquery.com/next/ maybe ... you would have to check when to start from the beginning i guess
[12:18:39] <Gho5t> then "this" isn't what you think it is
[12:19:36] <hlve> it's really quiet in here today
[12:19:40] <zfly9> grafi, that can't be the best solution..
[12:19:40] <NoiseEee> GoGoGarrett: what Gho5t just said
[12:20:03] <grafi> dont really know, it could be a working solution though :p
[12:20:35] <grafi> i would think ideally a slider plugin would bring somekind of active marker with it
[12:20:43] <GoGoGarrett> It works in every browser
[12:20:44] <GoGoGarrett> except ie8
[12:20:52] <unstable> https://github.com/JohnTheodore/faceplace/blob/master/user_page.php and https://github.com/JohnTheodore/faceplace/blob/master/comment-submission.php .. I am trying to get ajax to work (for the first time).. just to learn/play, this isn't anything production. When I submit a comment though, it sends me to the action comment-submission.php .. why doesn't it just add the div #result to the existing page?
[12:21:04] <hlve> GoGoGarrett, what's your code look like?
[12:21:07] <unstable> I don't know what the ircd.conf char limit is.. if that got cut off someone let me know.
[12:21:29] <GoGoGarrett> https://gist.github.com/gogogarrett/9d858c63cc11bda94383
[12:21:31] <dcherman> GoGoGarrett: does it fail in IE9 in IE8 mode?  don't have IE8 installed directly.  i'm pretty doubtful though.  unit tests would be failing pretty hard in the 1.* branch if added classes was broken.
[12:21:39] <GoGoGarrett> missing the $
[12:21:40] <GoGoGarrett> but i updated
[12:22:17] <terinjokes> dcherman: we've seen .siblings fail with classes, but don't have a good test case yes…
[12:22:34] <GoGoGarrett> I've tried
[12:22:38] <GoGoGarrett> .parent().children('li')
[12:22:38] <GoGoGarrett> as well
[12:23:20] <hlve> siblings doesn't work in IE8
[12:23:22] <hlve> hm
[12:23:42] <hlve> wait. it should.
[12:26:07] <Gho5t> siblings works in ie 8
[12:26:29] <Gho5t> GoGoGarrett: this isn't all of the code. please provide a demo in http://jsfiddle.net
[12:27:40] <Gho5t> also you should use .toggleClass()
[12:28:21] <Gho5t> nvm
[12:28:25] <Gho5t> no you shouldn't
[12:28:54] <Gho5t> but you should either cache $(this) or use the chaining
[12:30:15] <docmur> thanks :-)
[12:32:32] <zfly9> when using a child selector and this, how do you do it? ('this > div') ?
[12:32:54] <NoiseEee> zfly9: this.find('div')
[12:33:17] <zfly9> thanks
[12:33:26] <Gho5t> this.children('div')
[12:34:23] <NoiseEee> one of those, depending on what you're really searching for,
[12:36:30] <zfly9> $this.find('div') ?
[12:36:46] <zfly9> or do I wrap the entire thing in brakets
[12:36:52] <zfly9> and put the $ outside
[12:37:15] <culh> ask Mr. Manuel
[12:38:09] <NoiseEee> zfly9: well if your "this" isn't yet a jquery object, $(this).find('div)
[12:38:33] <zrab> does anyone know how to iterate through an array in a carousel manner
[12:38:44] <zrab> starting from any given index
[12:42:49] <slash_nick> Any reason why this would be crashing firefox?  https://gist.github.com/anonymous/7f4ebfe291d856e475b2
[12:44:23] <zrab> to re-iterate my question
[12:44:40] <zrab> I need to iterate through an entire array starting from an arbitrary index
[12:47:18] <BillCriswell> zrab: a.slice(234)
[12:47:42] <zrab> but that will remove elements
[12:48:06] <zrab> BillCriswell: that wil remove elements
[12:48:06] <jrajav> zrab: var i; for (i = index; i < array.length; ++i) { doStuff(array[i]); } for (i = 0; i < index; ++i) { doStuff(array[i]); }
[12:48:27] <BillCriswell> zrab: It doesn't touch the original array.
[12:48:40] <BillCriswell> What jrajav said will work just as well.
[12:48:47] <jrajav> Better, even.
[12:49:03] <zrab> no i want to start from an arbitrary index and have it loop back around to that index
[12:49:07] <jrajav> Yup.
[12:49:09] <zrab> for example
[12:49:19] <zrab> [0 1 2 3 4]
[12:49:20] <jrajav> Do you understand the basics of for loops?
[12:49:22] <zrab> yes
[12:49:31] <jrajav> So what do each of the ones I just pasted do?
[12:49:54] <jrajav> Assuming you have 'array' as your array and 'index' the index you wish to start at.
[12:50:03] <slash_nick> is there a shift operation to shift [0 1 2 3 4] to [1 2 3 4 0] ?... so shift(arbitrary_index).eachiness
[12:50:19] <zrab> i understand the first for loop but not the second
[12:50:41] <BillCriswell> zrab: It just starts from zern and works up to the random index.
[12:50:43] <jrajav> slash_nick: arr.push(arr.shift())
[12:50:56] <slash_nick> wouldn't that achieve what he's after?
[12:51:12] <jrajav> slash_nick: Uh, probably, but it would be more complicated and horribly inefficient
[12:51:55] <slash_nick> jrajav: can understand inefficient... don't know the api well enough to know how it'd read
[12:51:55] <zrab> i don't understand the second loop
[12:52:10] <zrab> so i see the first loop will start from a given index
[12:52:11] <jrajav> zrab: It starts from the beginning of the array and continues up to 'index'
[12:52:15] <BillCriswell> zrab: I just explained it. First one counts up from random index, the second one counts from zero to random index.
[12:52:26] <zrab> oh gotcha
[12:52:39] <zrab> is the best implementation?
[12:52:43] <zrab> *that
[12:52:58] <jrajav> zrab: Probably. It's the most straightforward and also the fastest.
[12:53:06] <zrab> k
[12:53:08] <zrab> thx guys
[12:53:20] <jrajav> You might be able to rework other parts of your application such that you don't need to do this "carousel" iteration
[12:53:41] <zrab> im working with an existing codebase
[12:55:23] <zrab> thx BillCriswell jrajav
[12:57:13] <BillCriswell> No problem.
[13:01:23] <zfly9> Anyone a genius out there? I want the text on the slide to have this effect http://soworldwide.org/, but this is what I have http://jsfiddle.net/6rhRd/4/
[13:02:04] <BillCriswell> zrab: Is cleaner I think.. but more expensive: var carousel = [].concat( array.slice(6), array.slice(0, 7));
[13:02:17] <BillCriswell> Oh, he's gone.
[13:03:17] <mg9831> I'm building a plugin - how can I destroy the instance of the plugin from within the plugin? (said plugin enough times)
[13:05:56] <BillCriswell> jrajav: What would you call a function that "carousels" an array like that?
[13:06:07] <BillCriswell> shiftRight?
[13:07:33] <BillCriswell> No that doesn't make sense... Hmm
[13:08:20] <slash_nick> BillCriswell: eachFrom ?
[13:09:03] <BillCriswell> That works for me haha.
[13:09:43] <pishposh> hey party people! what happens if i include two different versions of query?
[13:10:15] <slash_nick> someone will kidnap your family until you remove one or the other
[13:10:23] <BillCriswell> pishposh: You just made your webpage twice as awesome obviously.
[13:10:37] <pishposh> slash_nick: what if i don't really like my family anyway?
[13:10:47] <slash_nick> pishposh: they will bring them back
[13:11:17] <pishposh> seriously now
[13:11:30] <BillCriswell> slash_nick: Kill them, wait till you're celebrating, then bring them back with twins.
[13:12:00] <pishposh> slash_nick: there's no winning this one
[13:12:15] <BillCriswell> pishposh: I won't think jQuery will include itself twice.
[13:12:24] <BillCriswell> If it's already defined it'll be like 'nope'.
[13:12:33] <BillCriswell> I've heard it say "nope" before.
[13:12:45] <pishposh> y'all crack me up
[13:13:09] <BillCriswell> well we are hilarious.
[13:13:29] <BillCriswell> pishposh: Seriously though. It'll just used whatever was included "first" I believe.
[13:13:54] <pishposh> i see i see
[13:14:53] <pishposh> is any of this:
[13:15:04] <pishposh> $('#forename_submit').'click', function() {
[13:15:05] <pishposh> 	var name = $('#new_forename').val();
[13:15:06] <pishposh> 	if ($.trim(name) !== "") {
[13:15:08] <pishposh> 		$.post('new_user2.php', {name: name}, function(data) {
[13:15:09] <pishposh> 			alert(data);
[13:15:11] <pishposh> 		});
[13:15:12] <pishposh> 	}
[13:15:13] <pishposh> });
[13:15:14] <pishposh> woops
[13:15:37] <pishposh> is any of that bad for 1.6 jquery?
[13:15:55] <systemfault> Beside the flood, looks good
[13:16:17] <pishposh> systemfault: yeah i wasn't expecting that, my mistake
[13:16:18] <xckpd7> question: can you use parts of jQuery mobile on an already built mobile site? I have no idea how they are pulling off fixed toolbars cross browser
[13:16:59] <xckpd7> and I just want to use that part on an already built mobile site that isn't using a framework (I believe). So either use jQuery mobile, or perhaps pull out that specific functionality and use it for myself
[13:17:29] <BillCriswell> xckpd7: position: fixed; should handle the fixed toolbars if I'm understanding right.
[13:17:51] <BillCriswell> It's pretty well supported nowadays.
[13:17:54] <xckpd7> BillCriswell: not cross browser it won't. and it's also broken in the newest iOS on initial scroll
[13:18:50] <BillCriswell> Hmm..
[13:19:00] <xckpd7> put it like this: jQuery isn't using JUST position fixed, because their solution doesn't break on iOS devices... mine works, but it breaks on initial scroll sometimes
[13:19:18] <xckpd7> it's a known bug, I'll give a link if you don't believe me or don't have the equipment to test
[13:19:33] <zergion> what would be a better way to solve this? http://jsbin.com/axahey/1/edit am trying to change colour of 'p' while the div is visible
[13:20:00] <zergion> this above doesnt work at all btw
[13:20:11] <xckpd7> BillCriswell: https://github.com/Simbul/baker/issues/504
[13:20:12] <zergion> atleast not to set the color back to #000
[13:20:13] <b-ot> xckpd7: Issue #504 by webperformance (5mon 1w ago): Fixed elements don't stay in position
[13:20:49] <zfly9> Anyone a genius out there? I want the text on the slide to have this effect http://soworldwide.org/, but this is what I have http://jsfiddle.net/6rhRd/4/
[13:22:20] <BillCriswell> I just loaded up something with a fixed footer and I can't replicate it xckpd7.
[13:22:46] <xckpd7> BillCriswell: keep reloading the page, and quickly try to scroll without letting go
[13:24:03] <xckpd7> BillCriswell: I could give you video but that's really more hassle than it's worth. I'm 100% sure you could replicate it. It only happens on initial load. http://jsfiddle.net/zuA7D/19/show/
[13:25:02] <BillCriswell> xckpd7: I think I figured it out.
[13:25:09] <zoned> gem 'coffee-script', 'git' => 'https://github.com/jashkenas/coffee-script.git'                anyone see anything wrong with that? because i get Could not find gem 'coffee-script (>= 0) ruby' in https://github.com/jashkenas/coffee-script.git (at master). Source does not contain any versions of 'coffee-script (>= 0) ruby'
[13:25:40] <BillCriswell> xckpd7: I'm looking at this example: The footer fixed is fine, the header seems to have some kind of timeout before it works: http://bradfrostweb.com/demo/fixed/index.html
[13:26:46] <BillCriswell> It's like it waits for the chrome to go away ( think it's like 5 seconds if you're scrolled down the page a bit ) before the fixed header "works"
[13:27:30] <xckpd7> hmm the fixed footer works too...if you actually look at what happens in the iPad, something weird happens with the footer too before it's positioned
[13:28:12] <xckpd7> nope... I got it to break too
[13:29:11] <BillCriswell> I can't get anything to mess up on my iPad mini. I think it's just that weird delay for auto hiding the chrome if you're not at the top of the page.
[13:29:12] <xckpd7> well, not exactly. this works better than the other solution. If you touch it too fast after the page loads, the same problem I'm having with my example happens too
[13:29:14] <BillCriswell> That's a pain in the butt.
[13:29:48] <xckpd7> BillCriswell: I have an iPad retina, an original iPad, and an iPad Mini, and I can reproduce it on ALL of them
[13:30:12] <xckpd7> the link you've given me works better given (even though there is a flash of content changing)
[13:30:18] <zoned> does anyone know how i can lock in my coffeescript to version 1.40 as described here? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15119504/mercury-syntaxerror-cannot-return-a-value-from-a-constructor
[13:30:48] <zoned> i've tried … gem 'coffee-script', '~> 1.40',      gem 'coffee-script-source', '~> 1.40' … i'm lost
[13:31:47] <BillCriswell> xckpd7: Pain in the ass.
[13:32:39] <xckpd7> BillCriswell: in any case.... in regards to my origina question... can you use parts of jQuery Mobile without using all of it?
[13:32:49] * hlve slaps BillCriswell around a bit with a large trout
[13:33:09] <xckpd7> or extract whatever jQuery is doing to get that to work? jQuery's version of fixed header / footer is the best I've seen upon many hours of research
[13:33:40] <zoned> oh i just realized i was in #jquery not rubyonrails….. sorry
[13:33:43] <BillCriswell> xckpd7: http://jquerymobile.com/download-builder/ might get you what you want?
[13:33:59] <BillCriswell> I'm not familiar with it that much.
[13:34:49] <xckpd7> BillCriswell: ok I might as well dive in... always been interested in jQuery Mobile.
[13:34:52] <xckpd7> thanks
[13:35:09] <BillCriswell> I hear good things. I haven't needed it for a project quite yet sadly.
[13:39:10] <vacho> <table id="2002419"></table>
[13:39:17] <vacho> how would I with jQuery add some data to that table??
[13:39:54] <vacho> I tried $("#2002419").html('<tr><td>dfhdfhdfhfhdhf</td></tr>'); but it replaces the entire table instead of adding it to the table.
[13:40:14] <systemfault> vacho: Well… that's what it does..
[13:40:29] <systemfault> You might want .append
[13:44:39] <bluesm> Is jquery make something for ECMASCRIPT 5?
[13:45:07] <bluesm> I mean to use all goodies from ES5 but with compatibility ?
[13:45:28] <zergion> the slideUp function is pretty jerky if you have content in a div aint it?
[13:48:25] <zfly9> Anyone a genius out there? I want the text on the slide to have this effect http://soworldwide.org/, but this is what I have http://jsfiddle.net/6rhRd/4/ (or if not recommend a different slider where I can have the look of the soworldwide.org)
[13:52:32] <Sefyroth_> Hello. Quick question. I am trying to use $(document).on("blah", ".some-class", function () {}); to add some elements in my dom. I want it to be called when new elements are inserted in the DOM.
[13:52:58] <systemfault> Sefyroth_: Forget about that… there's no way to do that portably.
[13:53:12] <systemfault> Find another way to solve your problem.
[13:53:43] <systemfault> Sefyroth_: Not sure why you would need to call that function more than once though..
[13:53:48] <Sefyroth_> systemfault, do you have info as to why?
[13:53:59] <BillCriswell> Sefyroth_: You'd have to like.. constantly poll a container and see if the height changes or something.
[13:54:18] <systemfault> Sefyroth_:  Because the whole point of using that syntax of .on is to not have to rebind it all the time.
[13:54:44] <systemfault> Sefyroth_: With the syntax you're using, you can add/remove elements and the listener will always work on them
[13:55:24] <BillCriswell> zfly9: http://johnpolacek.github.com/scrolldeck.js/decks/parallax/ might be of interest to you? Think this is what you're doing for kinda.
[13:55:43] <Sefyroth_> systemfault, Problem is I want to add elements when they are added. I'll look into some other hook I can use to do this. I think durandal has a bunch I can use.
[13:56:16] <zfly9> BillCriswell I think that's a bit overkill for my knowledge
[13:56:33] <alainus> hi .. i'm working on a jquery.parallax page, but it only works vertically for some reason. here's the code: http://paste.ubuntu.com/5614781. any tips?
[13:56:55] <BillCriswell> zfly9: Looking for this minimal thing I had before...
[13:57:09] <magixx> im trying to implement a way so that users history on my website is tracked and on the main page they can see recent/most visited items, any preexisiting solutions?
[13:57:45] <zfly9> BillCriswell, is there a way I can do it with what I have, but just to get rid of that delay?
[13:57:53] <zfly9> that other side is exactly what I want
[13:58:54] <BillCriswell> I was totally misunderstanding what you wanted lol.
[14:04:22] <zfly9> BillCriswell, sorry should I re-explain?
[14:04:56] <zfly9> I didn't realize their site had parralax scrolling, I am only interested in the slider and the text beying delayed a bit

[14:06:41] <naeluh_> I dont understand why it would work in the fiddle but not in the page
[14:07:08] <naeluh_> I am not sure what would be causing the error Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'defaultView' of null

[14:16:47] <naeluh_> thing

[14:18:15] <Guddu> amph1bius, Thanks...Yes...Key 2 has keycode 50. Thanks makes sense now.

[14:33:50] <unstable> https://github.com/JohnTheodore/faceplace/blob/master/user_page.php and https://github.com/JohnTheodore/faceplace/blob/master/comment-submission.php .. I am trying to get ajax to work (for the first time).. just to learn/play, this isn't anything production. When I submit a comment though, it sends me to the action comment-submission.php .. why doesn't it just add the div #result to the existing page?

[14:37:03] <Danielc1234> Hi all, very new to jquery. I have a situation where our ecommerce cart uses a certain version of jquery and we have a slider box that seems to use an older version. The slider box looks very easy js, is there a way to update the sliderbox code and make it work with the newer version?
[14:41:29] <terinjokes> Danielc1234: is the slider box packaging it's own version of jQuery?
[14:44:59] <Danielc1234> terinjokes no it is not.
[14:45:26] <naeluh_> Its weird that it works in the fiddle but not in the page with the other code ?
[14:45:41] <terinjokes> Danielc1234: then wouldn't it be using your page's version of jQuery?
[14:45:59] <Danielc1234> terinjokes I tried this, <script type="text/javascript"> jQuery.noConflict(); </script>
[14:46:12] <Danielc1234> that is what I thought, but it doesnt seem to work
[14:46:23] <Unode> Hi everyone
[14:46:53] <Danielc1234> and if I use this version, <script type="text/javascript" src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1/jquery.min.js"></script> then my drop down menu does not work
[14:47:05] <Unode> To whom or where should I report a problem with the Download Builder jqueryui.com/download/ ?
[14:47:37] <Danielc1234> terinjokes can I PM you so I can send you a link?
[14:47:42] <Unode> I'm currently getting a "An unexpected error seems to have occurred. Why not try refreshing your page? Or you can contact us if the problem persists."
[15:05:48] <terinjokes> does anyone have a link for the old API documentation?
[15:07:38] <pulpfiction> is it possible to watch when elements with a defined class are created? for instance, every x mins i create an element and append it to a list. if i don't want to do a $('.myclass').each() everytime after the element is appended, is it possible to do something like $('.myclass').on('created', function(){})?
[15:09:49] <wassup> :>
[15:09:51] <wassup> hiya
[15:10:04] <pachet> pulpfiction: not without black magic
[15:10:09] <pachet> they're called dom mutation events
[15:10:12] <pachet> they're ugly as sin
[15:11:27] <guhcampos> can someone explain to a total noob in JS/Jquery (proficient in low level langs only) why the hell this code: http://dpaste.org/zc11D/ gives me a unexpected token 'o' on the third line?
[15:12:06] <say2joe> can't you just publish/trigger a custom event when creating the new element? (and have an event listener for said event)
[15:13:03] <pulpfiction> pachet: hehe i guess i should better stay away from that
[15:13:25] <say2joe> guhcampos: probably because JSON.parse(data) isn't getting valid string data for a json object
[15:14:27] <guhcampos> say2joe: well the data received was returned from python's json.dumps() so I expected it to be correct =|
[15:17:03] <say2joe> expectations are seldom met in communication btw client and server :)
[15:17:23] <say2joe> I'd set a breakpoint and inspect the data
[15:22:52] <mhn23> hey #jQuery. uh i'm looking to get my bg image to be background-attachment: fixed; in mobile browsers. site: http://mhdev.square7.ch/mh
[15:26:04] <guhcampos> say2joe: I'm not sure what's going on. Inspecting the data with chrome inspector shows what it looks like a perfect simple json =(
[15:26:25] <say2joe> hmmm.
[15:26:48] <say2joe> can you copy / paste a the data in the previous snippet?
[15:26:55] <guhcampos> It's actually quite simple
[15:27:44] <say2joe> you know, a glaring "mistake" is using the same variable name in two different scopes
[15:27:50] <guhcampos> say2joe: http://dpaste.org/dcXuz/
[15:28:09] <say2joe> it may not be the problem, but you may want to use different variable names (data)
[15:28:22] <guhcampos> say2joe: you say the 'data' var? Well this is very probably a bad idea. I'm kind of copying and pasting from some tuts
[15:28:35] <say2joe> send_report_to_email(data) — i would change that variable name to something else.
[15:28:36] <HorizonXP> hey guys, i'm having trouble with window.opener
[15:28:45] <HorizonXP> basically, i'm following what this solution suggests: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3951768/window-open-and-pass-parameters-by-post-method-problem
[15:28:54] <HorizonXP> and using jQuery to do the actual form submit
[15:29:25] <HorizonXP> works fine, but after all my server-side callbacks, the javascript that gets rendered into the popup window seems to have a blank window.opener
[15:29:43] <HorizonXP> does this way of posting data kill the reference to window.opener?
[15:29:47] <guhcampos> say2joe: I took of that variable at all, I don't really need it (bad copy and paste, I know)
[15:30:07] <say2joe> guhcampos: http://dpaste.org/dcXuz/ doesn't show the response… just the http header
[15:30:29] <guhcampos> say2joe: oops, sorry that's the headers, the data itself is simply: {"msg": "test"}

[15:38:14] <chipnt> djQuery, this field change function will have to change other values of same inline fields, marked by that number. Would be great if I can extract that id for futher use in the function
[15:39:09] <djQuery> chipnt, you could use standard javascript  replace to get rid of the common info and leave just the name
[15:39:11] <chipnt> anyways it looks like I'll have to strip the ids later I think I know how to do it
[15:39:34] <djQuery> or if there are allways the same number of - you could use split
[15:39:50] <chipnt> ok, anyways thanks for the hint, I'll do a global match and inside that function yes, I can use split or regex to match
[15:40:10] <say2joe> guhcampos: JSON.parse expects a string. if its already an object, you don't need to parse it… just do data.msg
[15:40:11] <djQuery> var num = this.id.split('-')[2]
[15:40:19] <Danielc1234> I'm using the latest version of jquery loading in your <head> section and then having some code work with a sliderbox that loads when you reach the bottom of the page, for some reason the sliderbox will not work unless I load the jquery right before the application. What am I doing wrong?
[15:40:24] <chipnt> ohh thx!
[15:40:32] <chipnt> djQuery++
[15:40:44] <djQuery> laters
[15:41:15] <guhcampos> say2joe: whoa let me try
[15:41:18] <Danielc1234> this is the application http://tympanus.net/codrops/2010/04/13/end-of-page-slide-out-box/
[15:41:47] <guhcampos> say2joe: that's it. Simple as it is
[15:41:54] <say2joe> :)
[15:42:18] <Danielc1234> but then if I try to load the jquery before the actual sliderbox, my top menu stops working.
[15:42:26] <invisib> Can anyone point me to a jQuery slider plugin that will carousel thumbs into a larger area? Kinda like this: http://i.imgur.com/RX0obwj.jpg
[15:42:30] <guhcampos> sweeet
[15:48:20] <velts_> has anyone ever had an issue where after an ajax call you set $targetDiv.html('Done'); and it just take FOREVER to execute that line on iOS?
[15:48:43] <velts_> everything gets into my success function ok, and all the rest of the code is running fine
[15:49:04] <velts_> but on iOS it seems to take forever to execute that one line
[15:50:29] <invisib> bump :[
[15:52:22] <say2joe> velts_ I recently read about some issues surrounding html manipulation (updating innerHTML property) at time in iOS. you may want to do some stackoverflow searches.
[15:52:33] <say2joe> i believe there are some "workarounds"
[15:53:19] <velts_> have been search for hours :(
[15:53:31] <velts_> will keep on it
[15:54:14] <systemfault> velts_: Are you sure it's the .html() call that is slow and not the ajax request itself?
[15:54:54] <say2joe> this might help? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4586022/is-there-a-bug-with-using-innerhtml-inside-a-uiwebview-within-a-native-iphone-ap
[15:55:14] <say2joe> its more directed at the native app but, may still apply.
[16:00:21] <invisib> Anyone know of a slider that does this? http://i.imgur.com/RX0obwj.jpg
[16:00:33] <invisib> Or can point me in the right direction of how to implement this myself?
[16:01:00] <boytoy_> invisib: huuuuuuuuuuuuuuuh?
[16:02:49] <invisib> Like, have one big feature active slide, and the other 2 are just thumbnails. After 3-4 seconds, all the slides slide around into new positions in a circular manner.
[16:03:23] <invisib> The small thumbnail on the left becomes a big featured slide, and the old big feature slide becomes a small thumbnail on the right, the old thumbnail on the right slides to the left.
[16:03:51] <invisib> It seems like there are 5000000000 jquery sliders, so I figured this might be one of them and you guys would know "the good one".
[16:04:07] <invisib> But the more I look for this particular feature, the less I think anyone has made it
[16:04:30] <invisib> So if no one knows of a slider like that, then maybe someone could give me some ideas on how to construct this thing from scratch
[16:05:04] <invisib> I'm trying to hack something together with jQuery Cycle right now, but it keeps display:none'ing my thumbnails if they're not active.
[16:05:26] <invisib> If I could get past that, I would be fine I think (just apply different styles to the active slide class)
[16:12:54] <scalex000> hello which editor do you use to show a code
[16:13:19] <invisib> what?
[16:13:24] <invisib> jsfiddle?
[16:18:20] <say2joe> invisib: I could only find 5000000 sliders.
[16:20:49] <invisib> I know, it sucks
[16:20:57] <say2joe> lol
[16:20:59] <invisib> So many sliders that do the exact same thing
[16:21:13] <invisib> "Oh mine's unique because it has this stupid animation!"
[16:21:25] <invisib> FFS slide your content differently
[16:21:31] <invisib> argh. :*(
[16:22:06] <say2joe> the worse part is… jquery includes slide animation already :)
[16:23:31] <say2joe> or, are you looking for a "form element" type of slider? a slider that accepts user interaction?
[16:24:36] <say2joe> here's a good idea: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5419469/github-slider-jquery-plugin
[16:27:29] <invisib> Aha! http://www.malsup.com/jquery/cycle2/demo/carousel.php
[16:28:33] <invisib> I bet I can slide using Cycle carousel, then just style the active class.
[16:29:13] <invisib> Nah I'm not trying to do anything as fancy as what you're thinking, I'm just a stupid newb trying to make a few slides roll around the screen
[16:29:20] <invisib> And style up the "active" one
[16:29:23] <pythonsnake> hi
[16:29:38] <pythonsnake> anyone know how http://imgur.com/gallery/7ulZGSB hide/show those little down arrows
[16:30:13] <pythonsnake> div class="caption-toolbar combobox edit-button" title=""
[16:31:36] <invisib> Hm, apparently there is a Cycle2 http://www.malsup.com/jquery/cycle2/
[16:32:30] <coldhead> fresh new cycle
[16:32:49] <invisib> pythonsnake: Just css
[16:33:01] <invisib> by default those down arrows are hidden
[16:33:26] <pythonsnake> invisib: code please
[16:33:28] <invisib> when you hover over the big element containing them it does.....           .containing_element:hover .down_arrows { display: block; }
[16:33:36] <sayd> is there a way to skip a qunit test?
[16:33:49] <invisib> not sure about selectors exactly, but I'm sure it's doing :hover and then the down arrow selector then display block
[16:34:23] <pythonsnake> lemme try
[16:35:38] <invisib> coldhead: Cycle2 = turns script configuration into data-attr config. Now we can clutter our markup! Yay!
[16:36:45] <sayd> no way to skip test except commenting the whole thing out. whaaay
[16:37:25] <pythonsnake> thanks invisib
[16:37:34] <invisib> np python
[16:38:01] <invisib> pythonsnake: you can use that same technique to make dropdowns and mega menus easily
[16:38:14] <invisib> http://pressedweb.com/css/easy-peasy-fully-custom-mega-menus/
[16:39:08] <pythonsnake> thanks
[16:39:10] <pythonsnake> good night
[16:40:43] <coldhead> good chat
[16:44:41] <shoky> unghh
[17:10:44] <yooyo> Hi can anyone tell me what CMS The Iconic is built on http://www.theiconic.com.au?
[17:10:53] <invisib> Yeah nm, Cycle2 sucks balls
[17:11:17] <invisib> yooyo try "BuiltWith" plugin for chrome
[17:11:28] <invisib> Prolly wont tell you, but worth a shot
[17:12:49] <yooyo> ok thxmate
[17:15:38] <RobOakes> Is there a way that I can attach a reference to a custom JavaScript object to a jQuery ajaxRequest?
[17:16:12] <shoky> RobOakes: what do you mean?
[17:16:20] <RobOakes> I'm trying to use an Model-View-Controller type pattern in my app, and would basically like to attach an instance of my model.
[17:16:42] <RobOakes> So that when the request finishes and the results are sent back, I can assign them to property values in that instance of the model.
[17:18:18] <shoky> var myCustomObject = {...};  $.ajax('/url').done(function(data) {  myCustomObject.whatever = data.whatever  })
[17:20:05] <RobOakes> Thanks. I'll give that a shot.
[17:21:24] <Guddu> RobOakes, I am using the JQuery complete attibute to indicate the function that will be called when my view returns back the response after the Ajax call is complete
[17:28:07] <coldhead> promises
[17:45:32] <xiphiasx_> hi
[18:04:22] <Tsd_> hi all
[18:04:26] <Guddu> I have this code $("#submit_button").click(validate_load);
[18:04:26] <Guddu> Is there a way to pass a value/parameter to the validate_load method?
[18:04:26] <RandalSchwartz> create a closure
[18:04:26] <RandalSchwartz> .click(sub { validate_load(35) })
[18:04:52] <Tsd_> i have some problem with a nested list
[18:05:04] <Tsd_> i generate it dynamically
[18:05:15] <Tsd_> and trigger create the whole content
[18:05:16] <say2joe> .click(function(){ validate_load(val); });
[18:05:31] <Tsd_> but unfortunatelly it doesn't look fine
[18:05:33] <RandalSchwartz> oops.  was thinking perl
[18:05:35] * RandalSchwartz grins
[18:05:40] <RandalSchwartz> yeah, what say2joe said
[18:05:41] <say2joe> :)
[18:05:48] <Tsd_> have anybody some experience with JQM nested lists?
[18:05:50] <naeluh_> ahhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!'
[18:06:21] <naeluh_> amph1bius: thanks for your help !
[18:07:10] <Inspiral> I have a number of divs with the id #collapse. These divs wrap a div called episode-wrapperX where x is an incremental number.  How can I adapt my jquery to show only the correctly clicked div ? - http://pastebin.com/DR9p8nt6
[18:07:18] <Tsd_> when i do listview("create") or refresh i get "cannot call methods on listview prior to initialization; attempted to call method 'refresh' "
[18:08:28] <RandalSchwartz> Inspiral - you can't have "a number of divs with the id #collapse"
[18:08:30] <RandalSchwartz> not allowed
[18:08:36] <RandalSchwartz> only one DOM element with a given ID
[18:08:46] <RandalSchwartz> so please rephrase your question in legal HTML
[18:09:10] <Inspiral> I have a number of divs and I will rename their ID to be #collapseX
[18:09:18] <Inspiral> bit better?
[18:09:30] <RandalSchwartz> sure - but within that is likely your solution
[18:09:38] <RandalSchwartz> so please implement that, and see if it solves your problem
[18:11:06] <Guddu> Thanks say2joe Trying that now
[18:11:31] <Inspiral> So, i implemented that and now it doesnt work as the function is looking for #collapse and not #collapseX, how can I wildcard this but keep it specific to just that set ?
[18:12:03] <say2joe> Inspiral — just a thought but maybe you want to use an id (c123) with a class (.collapse)
[18:12:47] <say2joe> can you do a paste bin with the html?
[18:12:59] <RandalSchwartz> even better, a jsfiddle
[18:13:03] <say2joe> unfortunately, what you're saying isn't very clear.
[18:13:05] <RandalSchwartz> jsfiddle while rome burned
[18:13:09] <say2joe> yeah… i prefer fiddle too
[18:13:12] <coldhead> hahahah
[18:14:08] <Inspiral> <div id="collapse1" class="collapse"><div id="episode1">some text</div></div>
[18:14:14] <Inspiral> <div id="collapse2" class="collapse"><div id="episode2">some text</div></div>
[18:14:20] <Inspiral> that help make it clearer ?
[18:14:35] <Inspiral> add a 'click me' before the start of the second div.
[18:14:38] <RandalSchwartz> I think you're over-id'ing, but whatever :)
[18:15:06] <Inspiral> im happy to clean it up once it works :)
[18:15:31] <Inspiral> basically i think i just want to know how to add a wildcard to the jquery part,
[18:15:40] <say2joe> just use classes… not ids then
[18:15:44] <RandalSchwartz> yeah
[18:15:52] <say2joe> i mean for your event binding anyway
[18:15:56] <RandalSchwartz> $('.collapse'). ....
[18:16:08] <say2joe> exactly :)
[18:16:52] <Inspiral> that is fine, but how does it know which child div to show ?
[18:17:07] <RandalSchwartz> well  "this" will be each parent
[18:17:17] <RandalSchwartz> so you can fetch the child in the event handler
[18:17:32] <Inspiral> ok, let me mess about with it
[18:17:34] <RandalSchwartz> bind it at event trigger time, or at closure time
[18:18:41] <say2joe> Inspiral — the important thing to remember is that when you do an id lookup, you'll only ever get one element back (if jQuery's workin' right anyway)
[18:18:54] <RandalSchwartz> $('.collapse').each(function () { var $this = $(this); var $divs = $this.children(); $this.on('click', function () { ... use $this and $divs as closure vars }))
[18:18:59] <Inspiral> understood there, ill keep to classes for stuff like that
[18:19:03] <sheilablackrose> hi guys im doing  var table = ele.closest('table');  how can i check if the table is visible or has rows? i tris $(table).is(':visible');
[18:19:38] <RandalSchwartz> missing some close brackets but you can sort that out
[18:20:50] <say2joe> sheila: you don't need the extra constructor call. table.is(":visible"); should work fine.
[18:21:02] <say2joe> closest() returns a jquery object
[18:21:16] <sheilablackrose> ic
[18:21:19] <sheilablackrose> let me try that
[18:21:33] <say2joe> but i wouldn't think that would result in an error.
[18:21:43] <RandalSchwartz> that's why I name all my jq object vars with $____
[18:21:50] <sheilablackrose> from table can i get the table id?
[18:21:53] <RandalSchwartz> then I know what I can call jq methods on :)
[18:22:00] <RandalSchwartz> $table.id
[18:22:11] <RandalSchwartz> or $table.attr('id') too, I think
[18:22:21] <say2joe> if (table.find("tr").length) /* it has rows */
[18:22:23] <sheilablackrose> thanks
[18:22:38] <sheilablackrose> awesome
[18:22:54] <say2joe> Randal: I do the same (use $table)
[18:23:30] <say2joe> i do often intermingle "raw" DOM elements with jQuery wrapped elements so I kind of have to or I'd go insane.
[18:23:52] <RandalSchwartz> yeah
[18:24:00] <RandalSchwartz> I learned that from some of the docs, I think
[18:26:17] <mfranz> I am attempting to work with forms and ajax calls to backend php, however I have found that calling ajax then redirecting to location.href("#newdiv") causes the page to refrest is there a way to prevent the refresh during new div call after onSuccess?
[18:28:14] <say2joe> location.hash = "newdiv"
[18:28:26] <say2joe> should work.
[18:29:19] <mfranz> And that will cause the page not to refresh since when it refreshes I get flashes of unstyled content before it properly loads the div I want since it isn't the first div on the page
[18:37:51] <Guddu> IN JQuery, if i have var args = { type:"POST"} and if i want to add a new item to args what is the syntax? I have tried args.url="load"; and args['url']='load'; but those two seem to be wrong.
[18:38:51] <say2joe> that should be fine.
[18:38:55] <say2joe> either one
[18:49:20] <beakman> any recommendations for a datetime picker?  both in one.
[18:50:22] <beakman> google and/or my search terms is/are failing me
[18:52:24] <anew_> anyone using require.js here ?
[18:56:23] <say2joe> yes
[18:56:40] <anew_> say2joe is integrating it with jq and plugins as simple as putting them in your main.js file
[18:56:42] <anew_> or am i missing something
[18:56:53] <anew_> https://github.com/jrburke/require-jquery/blob/master/jquery-require-sample/webapp/scripts/main.js
[18:56:54] <anew_> look here
[18:57:01] <Inspiral> thanks for the advice guys i got it working - http://pastebin.com/vzqScfi4 now i need to make it hide them again...
[18:57:05] <anew_> say i am using 15 plugins (exaggeration)... do i put them all in this file ?
[18:58:12] <anew_> also why is there $(function() in this file?
[18:58:28] <anew_> isnt just writing $('body').alpha().beta(); inside function($) enough ?
[18:59:14] <Snerf> how can I exclude something like this: .. $('.type1').draggable, but I dont want to use any type1 objects that also have a class of type2
[19:04:25] <anew_> please jesus
[19:10:08] <jrajav> andern_: $(function() { }); is a rather confusing alternative to writing $(document).ready(function() { });
[19:10:23] <jrajav> andern_: Ooops, mistab
[19:10:37] <jrajav> And now anew_ will spend the rest of his life in painful ignorance.
[19:10:52] <Inspiral> So, I have it working fine on click where it slidesdown, but nothing appears to trigger for the slideup part - any suggestions?
[19:10:53] <Inspiral> http://pastebin.com/Fu7Ds6Hd
[19:16:08] <nocturne7> is it a bad practice in jquery to execute code to create event handlers(with on) outside  $(function() {..})?
[19:16:53] <Tsd_> hi @ all
[19:17:02] <Tsd_> i build a little jsfiddle
[19:17:04] <Tsd_> http://jsfiddle.net/Sebtra/6EF2A/1/
[19:17:23] <Tsd_> does anybody know why my list isn't renderd correctly
[19:19:15] <b1lly> supsup
[19:19:22] <Tsd_> ??
[19:20:44] <shoky> Tsd_:  add $page.trigger('create')  at the end
[19:22:27] <Tsd_> hmmm are u sure that's the correct way
[19:22:42] <Tsd_> i tried it but it didn't renderd correctly
[19:22:52] <Tsd_> this is just a part of a bigger project
[19:23:09] <Tsd_> Phonegap + JMVC  +jqm
[19:23:15] <shoky> that's what your html turns into
[19:23:17] <Tsd_> i did several triggers
[19:23:29] <Tsd_> trigger create at both levels of list
[19:23:41] <shoky> even if you dont do the trigger, but just paste the outputted html in the source html
[19:23:47] <shoky> thats how its rendered
[19:23:58] <Tsd_> hmmm ok
[19:24:01] <shoky> see: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/6EF2A/2/
[19:24:27] <Tsd_> i have to check this
[19:24:29] <Tsd_> thx
[19:25:03] <Tsd_> just one more question
[19:25:21] <Tsd_> i do listview.create in my project
[19:25:29] <Tsd_> it looks ok but i get annot call methods on listview prior to initialization; attempted to call method 'create'
[19:25:32] <Tsd_> at the console
[19:25:41] <Tsd_> what's the problem?
[19:25:56] <Tsd_> how can i init the listview?
[19:26:29] <shoky> with .trigger('create')  i think
[19:26:41] <shoky> that calls .listview(...) for you
[19:26:46] <shoky> i think..
[19:27:14] <shoky> ( manually you'd need to call .listview() or .listview(options) )
[19:27:37] <Tsd_> no
[19:27:57] <Tsd_> when i do trigger('create') the list isn't renderd as nested list
[19:28:24] <Tsd_> the parent and all child items are put in one list item
[19:29:33] <shoky> you have two <ul>s under the same <li>
[19:30:11] <shoky> look: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/6EF2A/3/
[19:33:39] <shoky> your algorithm for building the list is wrong
[19:33:43] <Tsd_> hmm when i copy my html into jsfiddle it works fine
[19:33:49] <shoky> you're adding a new <ul> for each child-item
[19:33:51] <shoky> that's wrong
[19:34:11] <Tsd_> but when i do the dynamical injection in my project it doesn't work
[19:35:17] <shoky> because you're adding too many <ul>s into the same <li>
[19:35:25] <shoky> fix that and it'll render fine
[19:36:05] <Tsd_> http://jsfiddle.net/Sebtra/6EF2A/4/
[19:36:12] <Tsd_> that's my projekt html
[19:36:25] <Tsd_> is jsfiddle it looks nearly good
[19:36:43] <shoky> that doesnt have more than one <ul> per <li>
[19:36:46] <shoky> so its fine.
[19:37:13] <Tsd_> jep but in my project it isn't renderd well
[19:39:43] <Tsd_> http://img7.imageshack.us/img7/1768/jqmnestedlisterror.jpg
[19:40:34] <da-beginner> hi all.. how do i chain .slideUp() with .removeClass('selected') so that it will slide up first before it removes the class?
[19:40:55] <systemfault> da-beginner, you use the callback
[19:40:57] <da-beginner> but i cant just chain it with . because i am looking at different elements
[19:41:56] <systemfault> foo.slideUp('slow', function() { $(this).removeClass('selected'); });
[19:42:13] <Tsd_> hmmm @shoky do you have any idea
[19:42:14] <Tsd_> ?
[19:43:59] <shoky> Tsd_:  http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/6EF2A/5/
[19:44:58] <BrandonE> http://slexy.org/view/s21GQBg4hA - this works for 4 out of 5 iframes on my PHP generated page...each time I generate it, it's the same slot that has a problem. This is an example of one that doesn't work: http://slexy.org/view/s207zNGppL
[19:45:08] <Tsd_> thanks a lot shoky
[19:45:14] <Tsd_> i will try this
[19:45:20] <Tsd_> i will let u know if it works
[19:45:35] <shoky> np
[19:46:20] <Inspiral> http://jsfiddle.net/MDANC/ < could somebody let me know why the click to slideUp does not work ?
[19:52:06] <systemfault> Inspiral: Because that specific syntax of .on only works if the elements had the class at the point where that .on was executed.
[19:52:19] <systemfault> Inspiral: Since there was none... then nothing happens.
[19:56:37] <Inspiral> ok i figured something like that was happening but wasnt sure, what do i need to change it to to correct it?
[19:57:09] <Inspiral> instead of 'on' i use...?
[19:58:52] <systemfault> Ooops, you're not using .on but .click... (does the same thing though as the first form of .on though..)
[19:59:09] <systemfault> You would use the second form of .on:  $(document).on('click', '.collapsed', function() {
[19:59:42] <systemfault> Instead of the first one... which is $('.collapsed').on('click', function() {
[19:59:44] <jonathancutrell> Hello folks. I'm having some very strange behavior in a form listener.
[19:59:47] <jonathancutrell> http://codepen.io/jcutrell/pen/EoAhr
[20:00:04] <jonathancutrell> Specifically, pressing enter is triggering a click on the button#next element.
[20:00:18] <jonathancutrell> I can't seem to track down the cause of this. Using jQuery Validate.
[20:01:38] <jonathancutrell> The target of the click itself is the button.
[20:02:17] <jonathancutrell> I'm wondering if maybe I were to change that element to a non-button element, if that would be more suited to the situation, but the button element is the correct logical choice.
[20:02:26] <jonathancutrell> sweet plugin release today, timmywil
[20:02:49] <timmywil> thanks man :)
[20:03:11] <jonathancutrell> Also, nice Raphael tiger.
[20:03:14] <jonathancutrell> :)
[20:03:42] <timmywil> ha, I always liked that tiger
[20:04:07] <jonathancutrell> Me too. Stephen showed it to me back in the day when he was using Raphael to do upside down reflections.
[20:04:32] <jonathancutrell> (I know - not a helpful comment for the chat.)
[20:06:53] <jonathancutrell> Indeed - it looks like a click event is logged on the button element, but not on an anchor tag, all things equal.
[20:08:18] <BrandonE> http://slexy.org/view/s21GQBg4hA - this works for 4 out of 5 iframes on my PHP generated page...each time I generate it, it's the same slot that has a problem. This is an example of one that doesn't work: http://slexy.org/view/s207zNGppL
[20:30:44] <sheilablackrose> hi if i have a string say ####_####_###  and i would only like to get the first part before the _
[20:30:46] <sheilablackrose> how can i do that
[20:30:47] <sheilablackrose> ?
[20:31:24] <b1lly> theres a few ways
[20:31:59] <b1lly> you can turn it into an array
[20:32:01] <b1lly> and grab the first index
[20:32:22] <b1lly> var foo = "my_long_string_thing";
[20:32:55] <b1lly> foo.split("_")[0];    // returns my
[20:33:13] <sheilablackrose> ic is that the best approch?
[20:33:18] <b1lly> sure
[20:33:19] <sheilablackrose> i wont need the rest of it
[20:33:27] <sheilablackrose> just the first part before the underscore
[20:33:33] <grafi> just for shits and giggles how many others can you think of b1lly?
[20:33:44] <b1lly> substring
[20:33:52] <grafi> true
[20:34:07] <grafi> some cool regex that nobody can read
[20:34:13] <grafi> anything else?
[20:34:24] <sheilablackrose> thanks billy
[20:34:49] <b1lly> hmm
[20:35:06] <b1lly> nope not really
[20:35:11] <grafi> cool
[20:35:12] <b1lly> that's all I can think of
[20:35:12] <grafi> :P
[20:44:06] <b1lly> grafi
[20:44:22] <grafi> yup
[20:45:50] <b1lly> I just though of another way
[20:46:06] <b1lly> .slice()
[20:47:41] <grafi> true
[20:47:47] <b1lly> WINZ
[20:48:07] <grafi> :D
[20:48:28] <b1lly> man javascript is the tits
[20:48:56] <coldhead> >: |
[20:49:09] <grafi> well i can always loop over the string
[20:49:15] <grafi> in several ways!
[20:49:16] <grafi> :D
[20:49:54] <GoSox> what even handler should I use for the clicking of a radio button?
[20:50:01] <GoSox> .click() , .change() ? something else
[20:50:39] <coldhead> i like click
[20:50:58] <coldhead> but if you want to detect changes made by the keyboard you want change or focus
[20:51:17] <GoSox> does change only fire if you click on a radio button that was not already selected?
[20:51:31] <GoSox> i assume click() will fire even if you click on an already selected radio button?
[20:53:34] <LocalPCGuy> change
[20:54:30] * shoky throws a dime at LocalPCGuy
[20:55:25] <coldhead> hahahahah
[20:55:32] <coldhead> it's funny because poor people
[20:55:43] <coldhead> seriously though, give me $$
[20:55:43] <grafi> badumm-tzz

[20:56:16] <grafi> entertaingony?
[20:56:23] <coldhead> tragedy is when i cut my finger, comedy is when you fall into an open sewer and die
[20:56:29] <guzzlefry> Is there any way around the whole a:visited being disabled?
[20:56:47] <tw2113> add text underline
[20:56:56] <tw2113> eh, maybe
[20:56:57] <guzzlefry> ah
[20:57:03] <guzzlefry> I wouldn't think it'd be that simple.
[20:57:15] <tw2113> i offer no guarantee
[20:57:17] <guzzlefry> is disabled due to security issues :P
[20:57:22] <tw2113> i do know it was a security thing
[20:58:42] <guzzlefry> guess I could bug the mozilla guys and see if a plugin could get around that
[20:59:32] <GoSox> I'm making instant-active radio buttons. As soon as you click, i make an http request that calls a php, that changes a setting in my mysql table
[20:59:44] <GoSox> problem is, i feel like i've made it TOO easy to change site settings
[21:00:08] <coldhead> guzzlefry: if you really care you could use localstorage to keep a list of which links were visited
[21:03:36] <guzzlefry> coldhead: I'll look into that, thanks.
[21:03:59] <tw2113> personally, not dealing with visited link states is less to worry about
[21:06:14] <coldhead> staying safely in bed all day with a gun and the phone disconnected is less to worry about
[21:06:17] <coldhead> if it comes to that
[21:11:03] <RonWhoCares> I posted my question with 2 scripts at:   http://pastebin.com/CYbTKkgP
[21:12:48] <b1lly> wtb longer variable names
[21:14:34] <b1lly> man some people are so fiesty
[21:15:01] <Guddu> Dear friends...In my JQuery ajax call, i have my complete parameter specified as complete: process_results . . . . I want to pass parameters also to this function process_results...How can i do that? At the moment the method has the folllowing definition header function process_results(res,status)
[21:17:10] <b1lly> wow people downstairs I want to murder
[21:17:14] <b1lly> blasting their music
[21:17:30] <coldhead> what are they listening to?
[21:17:47] <b1lly> not sure I need to take my headphones off
[21:18:05] <coldhead> RonWhoCares: at a guess, is TINY maybe overwriting $? can you try $ === jQuery in the console to see if it's still there?
[21:19:16] <quantumplation> Heya!
[21:19:35] <coldhead> welcome to #jQUery, quantumplation
[21:19:37] <Guddu> b1lly, Could you help me?
[21:20:33] <quantumplation> So, I've been working on a social reader app for a while, and with the announcement that google reader is shutting down, we wanted to implement the capability to seamlessly import their feeds.  The user can do this by exporting the list, then importing, but that's a bit of a barrier to entry: If possible, i'd like a single click button.
[21:20:58] <quantumplation> I found the URL I can hit to get the list of feeds, http://www.google.com/reader/api/0/subscription/list?output=json
[21:21:26] <RonWhoCares> coldhead: I don't understand what you want me to do
[21:21:36] <quantumplation> this relies on authentication though, and I don't want the user sending his google password to us, so I'm trying to hit it from the clientside, and that's where jquery comes in.
[21:21:59] <quantumplation> when I request using ajax, I get an error because i'm making a cross site request, as expected.
[21:22:27] <quantumplation> But when I request with jsonp, the reader API doesn't support jsonp.
[21:23:05] <quantumplation> I can see the data being returned when I look at the raw response, but then jquery immediately tries to parse it as script code.  The data has made it to the client, and it's really frustrating to not be able to coerce jquery to handing me that data.
[21:23:32] <scar> how can i have 2 elements animate at the same time ? i want something to slide up and the bg to fade in at the same time, stopping at same time--
[21:23:42] <scar> just run .animate in 2 lines?
[21:24:01] <quantumplation> Everywhere i look seems to suggest that you have to bounce it off a backend server proxy, but by doing that we lose out on the client side authentication.
[21:24:40] <Guddu> Thanks found the answer at http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6448058/passing-additional-parameters-to-ajax-complete-callback-function
[21:24:51] <Guddu> JQuery is so much fun
[21:24:55] <Guddu> :-)
[21:25:18] <quantumplation> Anyone have suggestions?
[21:26:46] <coldhead> RonWhoCares: after the second script add this code: alert( $ === jQuery );
[21:26:52] <coldhead> you could add it before too
[21:26:59] <coldhead> if it says "true" then i have no idea
[21:27:07] <coldhead> if it says "false" then... shame on TINY
[21:29:44] <RonWhoCares> It says true :/
[21:29:57] <Zak> quantumplation: what you're trying to do is basically break the cross site protection
[21:30:24] <Zak> that's why JSONP needs to be supported by the provider
[21:30:50] <quantumplation> If so, it's already broken.  The data is somehow being returned by the server, but jquery is unable to parse it because it's expecting a script.
[21:32:18] <quantumplation> In the chrome console: http://i.imgur.com/u6DJUcX.png and when clicking on that, http://i.imgur.com/LJkqLFm.png
[21:32:51] <Zak> no, it's working as expected
[21:33:03] <Zak> the browser is requesting the information, but it's not accessible via Javascript
[21:33:18] <Zak> because you're trying to run a script which isn't valid
[21:33:29] <quantumplation> ah, ok. =/ It's so frustrating to be so close, yet so far XD
[21:34:03] <coldhead> RonWhoCares: does it still bork if you swap the order of the scripts?
[21:34:13] <coldhead> add tiny first, ajax later?
[21:34:27] <coldhead> quantumplation: that's what my mother was saying last night
[21:35:14] <scar> any reason i .animate({background:#ff0000;}, 500, function() {}); doesnt change the bg color? i even tried to use .css('background', '#ff0000');
[21:36:31] <Eviltwin> Well that syntax for the animation is horribly wrong
[21:36:55] <erisco> I need to popup a box programmatically (triggered via javascript) (say a quote balloon or something) positioned near an arbitrary dom element. Know any plugins?
[21:36:56] <Eviltwin> Have you tried .css('backgroundColor', '#ff0000')?
[21:37:16] <RonWhoCares> coldhead: Still has the error after loading Tiny Editor first
[21:37:45] <erisco> preferably something that looked like   $("myelement").popup("some text")  or close to
[21:39:08] <scar> Eviltwin, what about animating it>?
[21:39:12] <scar> animating***
[21:39:15] <coldhead> RonWhoCares: what is the error?
[21:39:45] <RonWhoCares> coldhead: I am not getting an error.  JQuery simply quits responds
[21:43:07] <nocturne7> when I switch between jquery UI tabs, my event handlers get disabled even though I am delegating events to document using on()
[21:43:11] <nocturne7> this is a single page app
[21:43:46] <coldhead> RonWhoCares: maybe the inputs your AJAX is getting its val()s from are being replaced by tiny editor instances
[21:43:58] <coldhead> in which case you need to use some TINY editor function to retrieve the values
[21:43:58] <nocturne7> is there some option that I am supposed to feed to this UI tab plugin ?
[21:44:01] <coldhead> instead of val()
[21:45:33] <RonWhoCares> Is there a way I could ALERT in the Tiny Editor script to confirm this is what is happening?
[21:47:35] <coldhead> RonWhoCares: i would try simply loading the page and running this code in the console
[21:47:46] <coldhead> console.log( $("#update_existing_distribution_channel_reference") )
[21:47:48] <scar> if im using .on('hover'), how can i do on "unhover"... lol. .hover() with 2 handlers does not work for me. ive had better luck with say, .on('click') rather than .click()- any ideas?
[21:47:57] <coldhead> you should see an element in the console, not []
[21:48:39] <coldhead> scar: .on('mouseenter', ...), .on('mouseout', ...)
[21:49:10] <scar> hm ty
[21:51:12] <scar> coldhead, http://pastebin.com/ve5j7Te2 - not workin :\
[21:52:07] <scar> however, on 'hover' of that same code does
[21:52:27] <GoSox> this is the first time I can think of, that I'm actually using an alert( ) as a real part of a page, and NOT just for debugging
[21:52:40] <coldhead> why don't i just drop everything and recreate this on jsfiddle for you >: |
[21:53:09] <LocalPCGuy> GoSox you should checkout jAlert
[21:53:11] <GoSox> coldhead: if you're looking to do work for people, I still have much to do on my site
[21:53:24] <scar> coldhead, nah don;t do that ;)
[21:53:29] <scar> i figured it was something dumb i was doin
[21:53:45] <coldhead> >: |
[21:53:46] <GoSox> LocalPCGuy: this is for a failed http request on the admin page. the error message will be rare and don't need to be fancy
[21:53:58] <coldhead> sorry that was a typo
[21:53:59] <coldhead> i meant
[21:54:01] <coldhead> >>>>: |
[21:55:30] <scar> coldhead, ok how bout this. for some reason it woks now, but it spasams... weird
[21:55:31] <scar> oh well
[21:55:34] <scar> ill tinker. ty
[21:55:55] <coldhead> good chat
[21:57:54] <coldhead> 4pm, 1st commit of the day >: |
[21:58:09] <Guddu> Dear friends...I have 2 lines of code. The first line shows a dialogBox and the second line just redirects to a default URL. Is it possible to have the second line execute only when the user has accepted the OK button on the dialog box? Please guide. The two lines are at http://dpaste.com/1023442/
[21:59:29] <guzzlefry> Guddu: What is showDialog?
[22:00:34] <Guddu> guzzlefry, The definition of showDialog is at http://dpaste.com/1023447/
[22:01:12] <guzzlefry> Guddu: I'd guess put the second line after line 10 in that function.
[22:01:38] <b1lly> coldlovely
[22:01:47] <b1lly> coldhead: what time zone are you 4pm?
[22:02:02] <guzzlefry> Guddu: inside the braces with $(this).dialog("close");
[22:03:49] <coldhead> b1lly: australian eastern
[22:04:03] <Guddu> guzzlefry, I don't want to redirect to that default URL always. So i wanted it to be independent of the modalPopup
[22:04:48] <Guddu> guzzlefry, Another option could be to add an extra parameter to function showDialog(text_message). . . . make it function showDialog(text_message, redirect) and if redirect is true then execute that code.
[22:04:49] <guzzlefry> oh
[22:04:52] <Guddu> What do you recommmend?
[22:05:07] <guzzlefry> handle the click event for that button?
[22:05:37] <GoSox> what is the default timeout for a $.post request?
[22:07:08] <guzzlefry> GoSox: Just a guess here, but I think it might be dependent on the browser's settings.
[22:22:47] <GoSox> i just used .ajax() instead
[22:22:50] <GoSox> 1.5 seconds
[22:22:53] <GoSox> plenty of time
[22:24:23] <coldhead> great work
[22:26:21] <GoSox> if i want to 'save' data when it's entered into an input, what's the best event(s) to fire on, I'm thinking a .focusout() and a keypress that checks for a return. Thoughts?
[22:26:31] <GoSox> *a text input
[22:28:35] <silv3r_m00n> hi there
[22:29:03] <silv3r_m00n> I am filling some content in a div, fetched from ajax, now I want to animate the height of the div to grow from 0 to the height required by the content, how can this be done ?
[22:37:30] <Guddu> Could someone please help me with this issue? The jfiddle is at http://jsfiddle.net/tV5e3/ . . . Basically the modal dialog box is retaining the title from the first call for some reason. Appreciate your help.
[22:39:20] <Guddu> guzzlefry, Could you help me?
[22:40:07] <tw2113> whatever everyone does, don't ask for help from THAT guy *points* He doesn't know anything
[22:40:46] <GoSox> hah
[22:41:07] <tw2113> who did i point to? hmm good question
[22:41:12] <Cork> Guddu: set the title in the dialog call
[22:41:29] <coldhead> it felt like you were pointing at me
[22:41:37] <tw2113> not worth the energy
[22:41:38] <tw2113> ;)
[22:41:40] <coldhead> scratchy throat, quarter after three
[22:42:07] <GoSox> to me, it felt like you were pointing to the guy that someone asked help from IMMEDIATELY before you said what you said :D
[22:42:28] <Guddu> Cork, Inside the dialog call? I did not get the idea. Could you please elaborate a little for me.
[22:42:29] <tw2113> nope
[22:42:35] <tw2113> my point wasn't dictated on speaking
[22:42:49] <coldhead> you were pointing at someone in the channel
[22:42:54] <coldhead> admit it
[22:43:04] <Cork> Guddu: http://api.jqueryui.com/dialog/#option-title
[22:43:59] <guzzlefry> tw2113: sound advice :P
[22:45:36] <GoSox> you can bind events to classes just like you can do IDs right?
[22:45:56] <Cork> GoSox: you never bind to a class or an id
[22:46:08] <Cork> you bind to an element, anything that can produce a list of elements can be used
[22:47:50] <Guddu> Cork, Thanks a lot . . . That helped my case :-)
[22:53:35] <coldhead> FURTHERMORE, CARTHAGE MUST BE DESTROYED
[22:54:20] <systemfault> It's already being destroyed...
[22:54:36] <systemfault> By retarded islamists.
[22:55:05] <coldhead> oh well then
[22:55:12] <coldhead> case closed
[22:55:17] <systemfault> :P
[22:55:39] <tw2113> now, onto Westeros
[22:59:14] <coldhead> ugh, cannot ungoogle
[23:00:08] <coldhead> http://imgur.com/jo5nfuh
[23:15:55] <djQuery> anyone looked at tern? looks like a pretty good js ide
[23:16:31] <djQuery> clow nite?
[23:16:36] <djQuery> lol slow nite
[23:17:45] <systemfault> djQuery: I don't care about tern, I want the sublime text plugin :P
[23:17:56] <systemfault> *tern IDE
[23:19:31] <djQuery> thinkhe is building plugin for it
[23:21:14] <GoSox> so clearly i can't animate a slideDown() on a table. if i put that table in a div, will it animate? or does the table just destroy everything?
[23:23:45] <Cork> GoSox: just set the div to overflow: hidden
[23:24:16] <GoSox> ummm
[23:24:17] <systemfault> djQuery: Yeah :)
[23:24:36] <GoSox> Cork: so are you saying yes it will animate if i wrap it in a div?
[23:24:55] <Cork> GoSox: the table won't animate, but the div will crop it at the end
[23:25:10] <Cork> GoSox: not sure what problem you have with the table though
[23:25:25] <djQuery> GoSox, y cant you? http://jsfiddle.net/djquery/dr6Cx/
[23:25:39] <GoSox> it is initially hidden, i'm trying to slideDown() to reveal it, in an animated fashion
[23:25:56] <coldhead> animating table elements is hard, but stuff inside or around tables will work
[23:25:57] <Cork> GoSox: show the table by default, and hide it with .hide() when the page loads
[23:25:57] <GoSox> but it appears instantly. i know tables and animations don't always get along
[23:26:01] <djQuery> k I see it just do show basicaly not slidedown
[23:26:27] <GoSox> Cork: what difference will that make?
[23:26:32] <Cork> GoSox: ya, cause jquery doens't know what its display type should be
[23:26:41] <Cork> GoSox: .hide() stores the original display type
[23:26:47] <GoSox> hmm
[23:27:29] <djQuery> coldhead, no worky http://jsfiddle.net/djquery/dr6Cx/1/
[23:27:55] <GoSox> yeah still doesn't animate
[23:28:03] <GoSox> just instantly appears full size
[23:28:09] <djQuery> lol you can tell the animation is still running even though the table is fully shown by the fact that the button wont react
[23:28:22] <Cork> GoSox: try make a jsfiddle of your problem
[23:29:00] <GoSox> Cork: djQuery's is good enough: http://jsfiddle.net/dr6Cx/2/
[23:30:03] <djQuery> GoSox, change it back to slidetoggle to better display how the animation is still running
[23:30:08] <GoSox> wrapping it in a DIV works perfectly
[23:30:11] <GoSox> http://jsfiddle.net/dr6Cx/4/
[23:30:39] <coldhead> <coldhead> animating table elements is hard
[23:30:43] <coldhead> that's what i said
[23:30:48] <coldhead> you have to animate something containing the table
[23:30:55] <coldhead> NOT the table or the trs or tds
[23:31:14] <djQuery> coldhead, what about animating cols?
[23:31:14] <Cork> GoSox: http://jsfiddle.net/dr6Cx/5/
[23:31:28] <Cork> ah :)
[23:31:48] <coldhead> no animating cols hurts too
[23:31:49] <GoSox> Cork: what does overflow: hidden do? it works just fine without that?
[23:32:01] <coldhead> animating anything tabley burns
[23:32:08] <Cork> GoSox: ya, cause jquery adds it by default while it does the animation
[23:32:10] <coldhead> but stuff inside or outside the table elements is fine
[23:32:18] <GoSox> ok
[23:32:22] <GoSox> well whatever, problem is solved
[23:32:24] <GoSox> thanks
[23:32:31] <coldhead> GREAT JOB EVERYONE, LET'S ALL TAKE FIVE
[23:32:37] <Cork> GoSox: http://jsfiddle.net/dr6Cx/7/
[23:32:38] <GoSox> NO REST
[23:32:39] <GoSox> KEEP GOING
[23:32:55] <Cork> thats what hidden does
[23:33:35] <coldhead> oh god i'm freaking out
[23:33:45] <rmill> coldhead: The walls are bleeding.
[23:33:55] <rmill> make it stahp.
[23:33:57] <coldhead> YES EXACTLY
[23:34:17] <djQuery> smoke em if ya got em
[23:34:20] <GoSox> yay my actual page works perfectly
[23:36:07] <coldhead> HOORAY FOR EVERYTHING
[23:37:14] <GoSox> so this is on my website settings page, for admins only. i realized that it was SO easy to change major site settings, that I better hide the "form" and show a little warning that you have to click through, before you start hitting tab and changing the whole site
[23:40:40] <djQuery> GoSox, WARNING Idiots that don't back up thier shieat not allowed past this point
[23:41:09] <GoSox> actually the warning is mostly for me, years from now when i don't remember how i built this stuff, and i just need to use it
[23:41:20] <GoSox> and for my girlfriend, that i made an admin to help me debug things
[23:41:48] <GoSox> but still, if i ever sell my site for a quadrillion dollars, the new owners will like the feature too
[23:42:08] <GoSox> also, working with radio buttons is weird
[23:42:40] <djQuery> use an on\off slider button
[23:42:59] <GoSox> is that a real thing? or do you mean make one?
[23:43:43] <djQuery> ?fancyswitch
[23:43:50] <djQuery> lazy bot
[23:44:00] <djQuery> GoSox, http://papermashup.com/jquery-fancy-switch/
[23:44:45] <GoSox> yeah this is for the admin page, no need to get that fancy
[23:45:07] <GoSox> although, a popup menu might be better than a radio button, for simplified coding and for making it not SO easy to turn major site features on and off
[23:47:49] <GoSox> Yeah I like that a lot better
[23:48:00] <GoSox> man, the one time I thought I'd get to use radio buttons… nope
[23:53:43] <GoSox> oh yeah this is great
[23:58:21] <GoSox> if a text field is selected and you close the window, is the .focusout() event called before the page goes away?
