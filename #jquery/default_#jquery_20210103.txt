[20:40:40] <JohnnyL> any of you familiar with js's fancytree?
[20:41:39] <robertmaxrees> maybe, maybe not.  might be able to help either way.  is it a jquery plugin or something?
[20:44:44] <robertmaxrees> JohnnyL
[20:45:35] <JohnnyL> yes
[20:45:58] <JohnnyL> at the moment I'm trying to locate which less/css files it is using.
[20:46:48] <robertmaxrees> oh?  whyfor?
[20:47:26] <JohnnyL> because I'm a newb.
[20:47:41] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[20:47:48] <robertmaxrees> are you trying to edit them or something?
[20:48:59] <JohnnyL> yes ma'am.
[20:49:17] <JohnnyL> jk!
[20:49:18] <robertmaxrees> don't do that.  add your own css file and override styles there as needed.
[20:49:36] <robertmaxrees> editing plugin files directly is always a Bad Ideaâ„¢
[20:49:36] <JohnnyL> that's a good idea.
[20:50:20] <JohnnyL> it's weird how it's using files is some other directory. because i am restarting the service and deleteing the css files.
[20:50:33] <robertmaxrees> how is that weird?
[20:51:35] <JohnnyL> how is it not?
[20:51:47] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[20:51:51] <robertmaxrees> can you be more specific?
[20:52:06] <robertmaxrees> do you mean the css files are getting re-generated?
[20:52:12] <JohnnyL> yes I can. I am trying to locate which css files are being used.
[20:52:20] <JohnnyL> nope, not that I know of.
[20:52:45] <robertmaxrees> why do you need to know that though?
[20:54:01] <JohnnyL> so I can mod them.
[20:54:12] <robertmaxrees> don't do that though.
[20:54:21] <robertmaxrees> add your own css file and override styles from there.
[20:54:46] <JohnnyL> ok
[20:55:21] <JohnnyL> the thing is, i don't know which ones to over ride there are MANY css props and I'm trying to determine which ones are what.
[20:55:41] <robertmaxrees> use your dev tools to figure out what to override?
[20:55:52] <JohnnyL> yes
[20:55:59] <robertmaxrees> cool
[20:56:03] <robertmaxrees> g2g
[20:56:38] <robertmaxrees> also: https://github.com/mar10/fancytree/wiki check the docs.
[20:56:53] <JohnnyL> OH
[20:56:58] <JohnnyL> I HAVE TO COLLECT STATIC in django.
[20:57:21] <robertmaxrees> there's info about how to make a custom theme on that page.
[21:00:10] <JohnnyL> theres a number of things I need to do when I use apache.
[21:00:16] <robertmaxrees> k...
