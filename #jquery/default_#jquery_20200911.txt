[07:03:51] <AmodKulkarni> Hello All
[07:04:07] <AmodKulkarni> A query from my end for the community
[07:04:40] <AmodKulkarni> Do we have any release plans for jQuery versions where we mention when older version will expire ?
[08:20:49] <AmodKulkarni> Hello All
[09:04:23] <Cork> AmodKulkarni: there isn't really any expiration on old versions
[09:05:17] <Cork> there is the major version numbers v1, v2 and v3 and i don't think any of them will get removed
[09:05:19] <Cork> (and no the bigger major numbers doesn't replace the smaller numbers it is different compatibility they provides)
[14:42:17] <fearless> hello
[14:44:49] <fearless> his is semantic-ui
[14:45:06] <fearless> How do I pass the parameter fullTextSearch: true -> $('.select-building').dropdown({fullTextSearch: true,...
[14:45:14] <fearless> o this one? -> $( ".select-building" ).on( "change", function(val) {
[14:45:39] <fearless> basically I'm converting a .onChange to .on
[14:45:59] <fearless> the the .onChange has a parameter fullTextSearch: true
[14:46:12] <fearless> how do I pass this in the new .on method jquery?
[15:53:06] <Justice> Hi, I'm having troubles what $obj.each(i,el) => { .. }.bind(this) does
[15:53:21] <Justice> the part i'm interested in is the .bind(this)
[15:54:06] <Justice> I think this is depricated but cannot understand what it really does

[20:40:43] <baruna> hello, https://jsfiddle.net/thbk708s/ < any idea why the last on change event doesn't work?
[20:41:44] <robertmaxrees> baruna you're dynamically adding that element.
[20:41:59] <robertmaxrees> you need to use a delegated event listener instead.
[20:43:03] <baruna> robertmaxrees: ah thanks :)
