[01:45:41] <Neo4> interesting code? var jq = $.noConflict();
[01:47:35] <Woet> no?
[01:48:10] <Woet> very normal way of using noConflict?
[01:49:59] <Neo4> why? what is sense?
[01:50:12] <Woet> why dont you read the docs?
[01:50:14] <Woet> https://api.jquery.com/jquery.noconflict/
[01:50:31] <Neo4> I've read and didn't understand
[01:50:53] <Neo4> I had read and didn't understand*
[01:51:51] <Neo4> Woet: if we add two jquery libs for example  a and b version what jquery will use and when?
[01:53:00] <Neo4> include a;
[01:53:00] <Neo4> inlude b;
[01:53:00] <Neo4> $.noConflict();
[01:53:00] <Neo4> $('selector').text(''); // what version will be used?
[01:53:11] <Neo4> Woet: any suggestions? :)
[01:53:19] <Woet> Neo4: try it and see.
[01:53:33] <Woet> Neo4: noConflict isn't made for running multiple jQuery versions.
[01:53:54] <Woet> Neo4: but try actually reading the link I gave you, it specifically tells you what would happen when you use multiple versions.
[01:54:14] <Neo4> I'll try
[01:54:26] <Neo4> Woet: it's you from php channel?
[01:54:52] <Neo4> Woet: your nick name is known, seems I saw you before )))
[01:55:08] <Neo4> Woet: you are from php, I guessed :)
[01:59:44] <Neo4> Woet: well, examples of apply?
[01:59:52] <Woet> Neo4: already linked you
[02:01:07] <Neo4> Woet: you linked and didn't say how it use, you would have said it uses when two libs use the same symbol '$' and it will lead to conflict
[02:02:06] <Neo4> other words we can't use jquery inside libs that uses $ symbol, it will linked to their own libs not jQuery, that's why we do this outside variables
[02:02:12] <Neo4> Woet: yes?
[02:02:37] <Neo4> Woet: in my case we have angularjs code and it uses $ too
[02:02:43] <Woet> Neo4: it quite clearly tells you how to use it, theres several examples.
[02:03:08] <Neo4> Woet: this is more understandable https://www.w3schools.com/jquery/jquery_noconflict.asp
[02:03:37] <Woet> Neo4: if less explanation with less examples from a non-official source thats known to be wrong is more understandable to you, sure.
[02:04:23] <Neo4> Woet: the less words the easier understand
[02:04:30] <Woet> Neo4: if you say so.
[02:04:46] <Neo4> Woet: do you know angularjs? It is good thing
[02:05:43] <Neo4> Woet: applies for single page applicasions
[02:07:14] <Neo4> w3 school is good resource for learning technology, there so many informations :)
[02:49:15] <Neo4> who does know tools where we put source code and in output we should get UML diagram of how this code works?
[02:49:56] <Neo4> it can be save time when you break down code
[05:08:22] <adium123123> Hey. On a ajax request, is the timeout option for the establishment of the connection or for the reply as well ?
[05:09:00] <adium123123> For example, I have a server that is there and I am able to connect to, but I want a fail-safe mechanism in case he doesn't reply back, after the connection is establish
[05:09:03] <adium123123> ed
[05:11:14] <Cork> adium123123: have you checked http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/ ?
[05:11:59] <adium123123> Yes, but I seem to not understand if the timeout is for the initial connection, or the reply as well
[05:13:00] <Cork> adium123123: as the page states it is from when you call $.ajax until it aborts the call cause it takes too long
[05:13:32] <Cork> it is NOT a network stack timeout
[05:14:00] <Cork> adium123123: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/ajax.js#L687
[05:23:53] <adium123123> Cork: thank you
[08:24:49] <dimi1947> is there anyway I can set with jquery the placeholder of an input?
[08:25:00] <Woet> yes, there is.
[08:25:06] <Cork> just set the attribute?
[11:03:33] <lerha22> How can I slow down the scroll speed of the webpage? Like this website http://entree.ge/
[11:31:56] <SylvanCyborg> lerha22: it generally is part of 'parallax' style, so there are some libraries to help with that
[11:32:16] <SylvanCyborg> lerha22:  like this one https://github.com/cubiq/iscroll
[12:18:35] <lerha22> SylvanCyborg: No native way of doing it?
[12:40:34] <lerha22> How can I slow down the scroll speed of the webpage? Like this website http://entree.ge/
[13:14:56] <SylvanCyborg> lerha22: there must be a native way yes, if you look at iscroll source you can see what they do
[13:15:27] <SylvanCyborg> lerha22: basically capture the mousewheel and prevent the default scroll, replacing it with a lesser amount of scroll
[13:42:47] <lerha22> SylvanCyborg: Have you ever used Iscroll? It's giving me an error
[13:43:28] <SylvanCyborg> i used it a few times, what does the error say?
[13:56:41] <lerha22> jQuery(...).iScroll is not a function
[13:57:15] <lerha22> Sorry, it's this > ReferenceError: IScroll is not defined
[13:57:34] <lerha22> Used the minimal code from here > https://github.com/cubiq/iscroll
[13:59:22] <robertmaxrees> make sure your code is after where you load IScroll.
[13:59:27] <robertmaxrees> and that IScroll is actually loading.
[14:00:13] <lerha22> Yes
[14:00:19] <lerha22> It is after that, I checked that already
[14:00:45] <robertmaxrees> any console errors?
[14:00:57] <lerha22> OH wait.. I didn't move the code of iscroll :/
[14:00:57] <robertmaxrees> what happens if you go to your console and type in IScroll ?
[14:01:00] <robertmaxrees> hah
[14:01:03] <robertmaxrees> there you go :)
[14:01:13] <lerha22> And I was trying to figure out and google around like what the..
[14:05:26] <lerha22> robertmaxrees The code runs now but the scroll speed is still the same. Is there any setting I have to do in iScroll?
[14:06:52] <robertmaxrees> i'd have to see your page in action.
[14:07:03] <robertmaxrees> make sure you're targeting the right elements and stuff.
[14:11:39] <lerha22> Here > https://tinyurl.com/y8f6bv3d
[14:12:25] <lerha22> I tried using mouseWheel: true and scrollbars: true but then it stopped scrolling
[14:16:44] <lerha22> robertmaxrees The container really needs to be position: absolute?
[14:17:05] <robertmaxrees> per their docs, apparently.
[14:17:44] <robertmaxrees> "Add position:relative or absolute to the scroll container (the wrapper). That alone usually solves most of the problems with wrongly calculated wrapper dimensions."
[14:18:27] <lerha22> Hm the container does have position:relative though
[14:19:11] <robertmaxrees> i'm assuming you haven't tried an isolated test case, yeah?
[14:19:34] <lerha22> I'll try it now
[14:20:38] <robertmaxrees> i also can't see where you're initializing iscroll on that page.
[14:22:45] <lerha22> https://jsfiddle.net/g3pmhno0/2/
[14:23:05] <lerha22> It's dollycakes-scripts.js file, the last js file
[14:23:08] <lerha22> in
[14:23:24] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[14:23:26] <robertmaxrees> so
[14:23:32] <robertmaxrees> that fiddle won't work for 2 reasons.
[14:23:33] <lerha22> Only this demo does what I am trying to achieve < http://lab.cubiq.org/iscroll5/demos/horizontal/
[14:23:53] <robertmaxrees> 1: there's no call to "load" and 2: the https link for iscroll breaks.
[14:25:28] <lerha22> https://jsfiddle.net/g3pmhno0/6/
[14:27:32] <robertmaxrees> same issue with the include.
[14:28:03] <robertmaxrees> use https://rawgit.com/cubiq/iscroll/master/build/iscroll.js instead
[14:28:50] <lerha22> Thanks, will try it
[14:28:58] <robertmaxrees> that fixes it for me.
[14:31:51] <lerha22> Ok it scrolls, but not as slow as that demo
[14:31:58] <lerha22> http://lab.cubiq.org/iscroll5/demos/horizontal/
[14:34:00] <lerha22> lol
[14:42:44] <lerha22> jeez no way to slow down the scroll speed? lol
[14:45:17] <SylvanCyborg> lerha22: speedRatioX
[14:45:25] <SylvanCyborg> or actually speedRatioY
[14:45:44] <SylvanCyborg> lerha22: http://iscrolljs.com/#configuring
[14:46:48] <lerha22> SylvanCyborg Isn't that just an indicator?
[14:47:03] <lerha22> http://iscrolljs.com/#indicators
[14:49:16] <SylvanCyborg> options.deceleration ?
[14:49:27] <SylvanCyborg> Default: 0.0006
[14:50:08] <SylvanCyborg> ooooo options.mouseWheelSpeed
[14:50:11] <SylvanCyborg> thats the one
[14:51:37] <lerha22> Will that work for trackpads in MAC as well?
[14:53:47] <SylvanCyborg> no idea
[16:19:25] <taplar> 6pm can't come fast enough
[16:23:36] <grapheti> taplar, I know that.
[16:23:56] <grapheti> I have my daughter's birthday party tonight.
[16:24:15] <taplar> YAAAAAaaaaaaaaah?
[16:24:42] <taplar> is that a + or -?
[16:28:02] <grapheti> I would hope it's a +.
[16:28:09] <taplar> yay!
[16:28:18] <grapheti> You gotta be messed up to not like your kid.
[16:28:36] <taplar> Well, I'd assume you could like your kid, but think a birthday party is a pita
[16:28:52] <grapheti> Ye, worth it tho.
[16:29:48] <grapheti> It's what you're willing to struggle for to see them smiles. :D
[16:50:34] <Kotorez> Can somebody please run this jsfiddle on microsoft Edge and tell me why it behaves differently from chrome? https://jsfiddle.net/wtono33s/12/
[16:51:02] <robertmaxrees> do i need top do something after it laods?
[16:51:54] <Kotorez> Just pick an option and press up/down
[16:52:04] <robertmaxrees> and nothing happens?
[16:52:42] <Kotorez> in chrome it works fine but in Edge the previous options get selected too. When mouse hovers over the option list, the selection of previous ones disappears.
[16:53:37] <robertmaxrees> interesting.
[16:54:10] <Kotorez> are you seein that too or is it just my computer?
[16:54:27] <robertmaxrees> i'm seeing it now.
[16:55:17] <Kotorez> this does not happen in IE11 and I dont think my JS does anything special.
[16:55:34] <robertmaxrees> any reason you're using inline event binding?
[16:55:49] <robertmaxrees> shouldn't make a difference but it's one thing I'm noticing.
[17:01:28] <robertmaxrees> so a coupla thoughts - it looks like you're not actually rearranging the dom, but instead shifting text and values around.
[17:01:31] <taplar> i feel like this would be much simpler if the element was just moved.
[17:01:37] <robertmaxrees> ^
[17:01:40] <taplar> lol
[17:01:42] <robertmaxrees> should fix the issue, as well.
[17:03:35] <taplar> really a ##javascript question though
[17:03:55] <robertmaxrees> fair point.
[17:04:15] <Kotorez> those guys are talking about monands and its hard to fit a legit javascript questions in that conversation :)
[17:04:28] <robertmaxrees> nah.
[17:04:31] <robertmaxrees> you just drop your question.
[17:04:35] <robertmaxrees> if they can answer, they will :)
[17:05:44] <taplar> https://stackoverflow.com/a/1363724/1586174
[17:20:42] <grapheti> drop it like it's hawt
[18:18:30] <taplar> i like ta move it, move it
