[05:46:07] <trickjumper[m]> modal ??
[05:57:51] <trickjumper[m]> yes thank you it's a modal !
[12:51:44] <gman> hey there :)
[12:56:37] <gman> Im a little new to js in general, been playing around with the jquery-ui, atm im trying to get the ui-menu to close after a menu item is clicked
[12:56:56] <gman> i tired to force a click using $(document).click();
[12:57:58] <gman> i did this after the this.element.trigger( "focus", [ true ] );
[12:58:14] <gman> and also
[12:58:16] <gman> 		// Clicks outside of a menu collapse any open menus		this._on( this.document, {			click: function( event ) {				if ( this._closeOnDocumentClick( event ) ) {					this.collapseAll( event );				}				// Reset the mouseHandled flag				this.mouseHandled = false;			}		} );
[12:58:53] <gman> sorry guys, lemme put it in jsfiddle.net
[13:10:29] <ghere> i created a fiddle if anyone wants to check it out :)
[13:10:33] <ghere> https://jsfiddle.net/#&togetherjs=OySFh8yTGA
[13:15:24] <ghere> https://jsfiddle.net/hc06byv8/2/
[13:20:53] <ghere> sorry, https://jsfiddle.net/17cder9v/
[13:29:13] <robertmaxrees> ghere not seeing jquery or jquery ui loaded anywhere?
[13:29:56] <robertmaxrees> ghere you can see it added here: https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/fv9gn3om/
[13:30:22] <robertmaxrees> secondly - is 'widgetsMenu' a plugin of some kind?
[13:32:26] <ghere> i simply copied and pasted the jquery-ui.js into the js of the fiddle & added some comments on top
[13:32:37] <robertmaxrees> ah, so that's now how you use jsfiddle :)
[13:33:39] <robertmaxrees> instead of load using the resources inputs on the left or js options menu the https://i.imgur.com/eQGvfZz.png
[13:33:41] <ghere> sorry dude, im completely new to js, have experience with some other languages. willing to learn if there is a better way to do it :)
[13:33:48] <robertmaxrees> *or the js options menu
[13:34:20] <robertmaxrees> and then just enough js, html, and css to replicate the issue.
[13:34:26] <ghere> damn, that is much better!
[13:34:33] <ghere> thanks :)
[13:51:30] <ghere> cool, came up with this :) https://jsfiddle.net/rtodc2wy/
[13:51:58] <robertmaxrees> so how do i replicate?
[13:52:25] <robertmaxrees> wait a sec back waaaay up - <link rel="stylesheet" href="assets/css/bootstrap.min.css">
[13:52:34] <robertmaxrees> are you using bootstrap and jquery ui next to each other here?
[13:53:09] <ghere> yeah kinda, im guessing this is bad
[13:53:40] <ghere> im just playing around a bit here, trying to get more familiar with things
[13:53:45] <robertmaxrees> :) they both do the same thing and have their own solutions for common problems.  mixing and matching is a great way to give yourself big headaches.
[13:55:03] <ghere> lol, someone should do them a merger :p
[13:55:09] <ghere> i had no idea 0.o
[13:55:30] <robertmaxrees> "do them a merger"?
[13:55:36] <robertmaxrees> oh you mean combine them?
[13:56:13] <ghere> yeah, remember i really dont know much about anything here, im a fish out of water
[13:57:32] <ghere> stupid question here, when should you use one and the other?
[13:58:00] <robertmaxrees> ah - yeah, you want competing solutions since choice is a good thing AND because they'll approach different problems in different ways, leading to one being better suited for certain situations than others.
[13:58:33] <robertmaxrees> that's not a stupid question at all, though not the answer you'll expect: between jqui and bootstrap, always pick bootstrack.
[13:59:14] <robertmaxrees> *bootstrap.  jqui is currently all but dead.  it's not really being actively developed and is relatively antiquated.
[14:00:49] <ghere> looks like ive been looking into a dead language then, im checking out some bootstrap docs
[14:01:00] <robertmaxrees> *framework
[14:01:12] <ghere> *framework :)
[14:02:01] <ghere> so you're saying now-a-days, its better to just use bootstrap by itself yeah? :)
[14:02:22] <ghere> with just a slim version of jquery
[14:02:59] <robertmaxrees> jquery isn't a dep for bootstrap these days, and you never wanted to use both JQUI and bootstrap together :)
[14:04:20] <ghere> you know ive learnt a BIG lesson here thanks to you :)
[14:04:31] <robertmaxrees> :)
[14:04:52] <ghere> i always want to do things the right way and it looks like i was going to shoot myself in the foot
[14:07:41] <ghere> im just going to keep practicing over here, are there any good websites / books you might recommend? :)
[14:08:02] <ghere> *to learn
[14:09:15] <robertmaxrees> there's a ##bootstrap available for that framework.
[14:09:35] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, MDN and Stack Overflow are great resources.  do you have programming experience in another language?
[14:10:03] <ghere> yeah with spring & android
[14:10:21] <ghere> i know nothing really about js & css
[14:10:35] <ghere> the dumbest person you'll find :p
[14:10:48] <robertmaxrees> i mean, i've worked with them for years and still don't know anything ;)
[14:12:39] <ghere> at least you know how to not copy and paste the entire jquery into jsfiddle lol
[14:12:49] <robertmaxrees> lol
[16:09:48] <mivan0v> can anyone help me find out why `util.walker` thinks `obj` is null? https://bpa.st/XKZA
[16:11:08] <robertmaxrees> mivan0v doesn't look like you're using jquery for that part.
[16:11:28] <robertmaxrees> much more likely to get help if you pare this down to just the specific code in question and replicate the bug itself.
[16:38:23] <shoky> mivan0v: a nested null would also cause that error. e.g. if one of the properties of the 'ttz' object has a null value
[16:39:14] <mivan0v> shoky: hmmm
[16:46:51] <mivan0v> shoky: any other cases that would make it null?
[16:47:22] <mivan0v> shoky: robertmaxrees i figured out the error occurs on line 11
[16:48:45] <mivan0v> shoky: you're a fuckin genius
[16:48:48] <mivan0v> found the error
[16:56:40] <shoky> ;)
[17:30:17] <Destramic> i need to find a element via :readonly, but i cant see its a thing
[17:35:04] <shoky> Destramic: [readonly] should work
[17:38:05] <shoky> Destramic: o actually :read-only too
[17:39:49] <Destramic> what the!
[17:40:04] <Destramic> i been googling and havent seen a reference to it
[17:40:17] <Destramic> i'll do some testing, thank you shoky
[17:42:04] <Destramic> https://jsfiddle.net/destramic/1tsxyejb/   beautiful
[17:46:17] <shoky> Destramic it's a css selector, not jquery. so its not in jquery docs
[17:55:08] <Destramic> shoky thank you for the information, you saved me some effort :)
[20:21:12] <zacwalls> So I am working on a medical consent form and I am trying to make it so that a patient can select their doctor in a select tag. On the form, the patient has to select their doctor several times. I'm trying to make something that'll update each select field to the option selected given one is changed. Right now, it works if you only do it once. Once you try to switch back, nothing happens. How can I
[20:21:14] <zacwalls> make it so you can switch either way? https://jsbin.com/viqazexohi/edit?html,js,console,output
[20:42:43] <robertmaxrees> zacwalls for starters, $('.dr_select').val('Maristany') is setting the value of all of them to Maristany, then $('.dr_select').val('Roberts') sets them all to Roberts - you want to check the value in those ifs, not set them.
[20:43:21] <robertmaxrees> zacwalls also: do you just care about the first dropdown?  or if any of them are changed you want to set the value?
[20:43:57] <shoky> $('.dr_select').val(this.value);    ;p
[20:44:07] <zacwalls> robertmaxrees: If any are changed ideally. Wait so my if statement conditional is actually setting the value there?
[20:44:26] <robertmaxrees> zacwalls yeah.  .val('foo') is setting the value.
[20:44:41] <robertmaxrees> check out what shoky just suggested for the "smart" way to do it.
[20:44:55] <zacwalls> Ooh ok
[20:45:15] <robertmaxrees> $(this).val('Roberts'); - you're using it the same way here :)
[20:45:52] <robertmaxrees> rules don't change based on if you're using $(this) or not.
[20:46:30] <zacwalls> I think I'm lost. So those if statements aren't checking the correct thing, but are in fact setting the values of the selects?
[20:47:03] <shoky> yes
[20:47:19] <zacwalls> Oh ok. Hmm.
[20:47:20] <robertmaxrees> yeah.  right now your code is checking if $('.dr_select').val('Maristany') is truthy (which is is), then setting all of those .dr_selects again to Maristany, then it does the same thing all over again for Roberts.
[20:47:39] <robertmaxrees> so you're basically setting every dropdwon twice haha
[20:47:45] <robertmaxrees> actually 4 times.
[20:48:01] <zacwalls> Thats rough
[20:50:29] <zacwalls> robertmaxrees shoky thanks so much y'all!
