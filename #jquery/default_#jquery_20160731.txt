[02:09:37] <hamdjan__> i'd like to use a jquery slider to send a get request to my haystack view/form. i think i can't just use jquery's    $.get('/my/page', {val1: val1, val2: val2 }    because then the http response will be only available in my jquery code and not use my template to create the haystack page? so i'd have to complicatetly do what my template does with jquery? if that's correct, then i should maybe create hidden input fields when the slider is changed
[02:09:37] <hamdjan__> and then click $myForm.submit() from jquery?
[03:45:39] <CuriousMind> I need help. How do I use the .toggle() method so when you click a button it .show() and .hide() a div on the page with text?
[05:00:31] <JosefDe> Hi guys
[05:00:52] <JosefDe> I'm using this little suggest-tool: http://jsfiddle.net/7wYHX/106/
[05:01:16] <JosefDe> Now I want to avoid that during typing of the user tens of http-requests are sent.
[05:01:55] <JosefDe> So if the user is typing "2005" it shouldn't send 10-20 requests and make everything slow
[05:02:12] <JosefDe> Is there any code-snippet anyone has for this case?
[05:07:49] <JosefDe> I don't know how to integrate it best to that existing solution
[05:08:02] <JosefDe> I want it to be fast, but I don't have that much experience with this
[05:16:08] <systemfault> JosefDe: Usually, a "debounce" function is used for that
[05:18:58] <JosefDe> systemfault: Hi buddy. Do you have a good example for me?
[05:19:32] <systemfault> JosefDe: If you want a debounce function, you could take a look at the one from lodash
[05:22:16] <naftilos76> Hi everyone. supposing that i have a div with id='master' that contains a button div with id='button' previously setup with method .on("mouseup", function(){}) . If i do $("#master").html(""); will that erase all mouse event listeners previously set up for div with id='button' ?
[05:28:26] <systemfault> naftilos76: yes.
[05:28:49] <naftilos76> systemfault, thanks, just confirming
[05:29:33] <JosefDe> systemfault: lodash sounds good. Isn't there anything in backbone or underscore for that?
[05:30:09] <systemfault> JosefDe: lodash is basically an improved, drop-in replacement for underscore.
[05:30:16] <systemfault> So yes.. underscore probably has it.
[05:30:30] <systemfault> Nobody should be using underscore at this point IMHO
[05:37:47] <JosefDe> systemfault: Ok. I asked because I have to use underscore. Don't underscore and lodash collidate if I include them both?
[05:38:20] <systemfault> You usually pick one or the other, since you're already using underscore, just use the underscore version.
[05:45:40] <jop008> I have this <h3 id="h3" data-action="list" class="ui-collapsible-heading ui-collapsible-heading-collapsed">
[05:46:23] <jop008> when I do oel = $("h3"); I have a hit but when I do ]
[05:46:24] <jop008> oel = $("h3l[data-action='list']");
[05:46:26] <jop008> no hit
[05:46:56] <jop008> I want to select h3 with data attribute data-acion =" list"
[06:09:47] <adisha> hi I am getting err "Response for preflight has invalid HTTP status code 403" when I try to send headers with jquery ajax request
[06:10:16] <adisha> code for 	$.ajaxSetup({     headers: { 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' : '*',     	"Authorization": authToken } 	});

[06:33:19] <quantomworks> Hi! I'm experienced in html/css/javascript/php/tons of other things, but new as f*** to jquery. Where do I go to learn this new magic and all the spells that come with it? Specifically jScrollPane
[06:48:59] <JosefDe> Phuu..
[06:49:30] <JosefDe> Can anyone tell me why Underscore's debounce makes my input into the textfield very slow?
[06:50:13] <JosefDe> Hm.. No. It doesn't make it slow.. But I don't see any effect of debounce
[06:53:27] <JosefDe> Guys. Can anyone help me?
[06:53:34] <JosefDe> Debounce is not the correct thing I'm looking for
[06:54:04] <JosefDe> It only delays execution but doesn't change the amount of executions
[06:57:48] <MarkTheMark> could anyone help me with my login system? i want to load a logout button once the user is securely logged in. http://192.241.153.25:8000
[06:58:41] <JosefDe> I think "throttle" is the correct thing
[07:01:29] <JosefDe> I dont get it..
[07:45:15] <JosefDe> Can anyone tell me why underscore's throttle doesn't work with VisualSearch.js?
[09:52:52] <jop008> I have this $("#m_prefix").change(function () { but change not fired

[12:01:18] <z1haze> what is the purpose of bower!?
[12:02:01] <z1haze> isnt npm literally the same thing? and bower is installed via npm.. makes no sense
[12:08:48] <shoky> good question ;)
[12:24:00] <helpNeeded> Response to preflight request doesn't pass access control check: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource. Origin 'null' is therefore not allowed access. The response had HTTP status code 403.
[12:24:10] <helpNeeded> I am stuck due to this err
[12:24:19] <helpNeeded> Please someone help
[12:34:06] <arup_r> I am trying to create an HTML using Jquery() method. I have 2 <span> s inside a button, but I am able to add 1, and no idea about how to add the second one. mostly don't know the syntax. Any help? https://jsfiddle.net/4szkmbk0/

[13:48:52] <urbanendeavour> Is there anything wrong with this?
[13:49:09] <urbanendeavour> $(this.id).mouseover(function(){
[13:49:13] <urbanendeavour> $(this.id).hide();
[13:49:16] <urbanendeavour> });
[13:59:51] <the_voice_> I came across this today
[13:59:53] <the_voice_> (function(document, window, $) {
[14:00:02] <the_voice_> Is there an advantage to using that over document.ready?
[14:01:03] <the_voice_> It ends like this obviously })(document, window, jQuery);
[14:18:53] <sillyslux> the_voice_, there is no document.ready and what you came across has nothing to do with $(document).ready or document.readyState
[14:19:26] <sillyslux> in case you use this: https://learn.jquery.com/using-jquery-core/avoid-conflicts-other-libraries/
[14:19:52] <sillyslux> you can't use jQuery with `$()` in your code
[14:21:22] <sillyslux> but you can if you wrap your code in (function($){/*here $ points to jQuery*/})(jQuery)
[14:24:39] <sillyslux> the_voice_, found a link explaining it https://toddmotto.com/what-function-window-document-undefined-iife-really-means/#arguments
[14:25:08] <the_voice_> thanks
[14:47:34] <Welcome> Trying to use .html() replacing the content of a div but struggling and getting weird results. http://pastebin.com/ZGhFr5E1
[16:43:03] <speedio> im trying to do the following http get request to an odata rest api.. http://pastebin.com/t1qVCKDQ , but i get an error 'because its MIME type ('application/json') is not executable' , anyone know why?
[17:03:57] <shoky> speedio: JSONP requires the server to specifically support JSONP. it's a hack that uses a <script> element instead of ajax
[17:04:53] <shoky> speedio: also that access-control header you're putting is a header that servers respond with, not clients sent with the request like you're doing...
[17:05:06] <shoky> (read about CORS for details on that)
[17:20:23] <speedio> shoky: ive read about cors , but for some reason the backend im trying to work agains (microsoft dynamics nav) isnt supporting cors :/.. but jsonp should work
[17:21:08] <speedio> shoky: ok so i shouldnt set the header at all then>
[17:21:10] <speedio> ?
[18:09:48] <shoky> speedio: no you shouldn't set that header on the browser side. and JSONP needs special support from the server - your error message means that the response from server was regular JSON, not wrapped in a JSONP response. so that url at least doesn't do jsonp
[18:12:53] <mydog2> hey guys.. new to jquery.. not a front side guy.. not trying to be one.. but i'm looking to create a quick test of an ajax drop menu/list.. that hooks to a db. user selects from a list of items in the 1st select.. the ajax hits the db returns the list that allows the user to select from the next list.. so i'm talking about a series of "scrollable" lists, populated by the prior selection..
[18:13:17] <mydog2> anyone know of an app or chunk of code that does something similar i can take a look at?
[18:13:35] <mydog2> been searching off the net.. github/etc..
[18:13:44] <mydog2> thought i'd ask here as well..
[18:13:45] <mydog2> thanks
[19:12:55] <quantomworks> is there some sort of tutorial on how to use this for a beginner jquery user? All im trying to do is alter the color of the scroll bar and move one of them to the right instead of the left http://jscrollpane.kelvinluck.com/
[23:10:19] <JosefDe> Hi guys. I'm trying to do a JSONP-request to http://myexternalserver.com out of http://myserver.com. No request is sent. Instead firefox says "https://www.google.de/?gws_rd=ssl#q=blocked+loading+mixed+active+content". How can I fix this?
[23:38:43] <JosefDe> Hi guys
[23:39:04] <JosefDe> I'm using JSONP and getting the error that "callback" is not defined
