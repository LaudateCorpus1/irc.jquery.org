[00:39:03] <LSshock> Hi everyone, i'm trying to filter out plain tekst bbcode and so far its going alright but my each() part stops after the first. Wondering if anyone can tell me why http://jsfiddle.net/ideaprison/evtns/55/ thanks!
[00:58:11] <sw33tlull4by> hi there!I have a problem with ajax.  the following functions are used to retrieve information, amogst those informations is a url for a picture, putting in a static url shows the picture, putting in the string from the ajaxrequest, yields nothing, but an empty spot, entering the url in a browser shows the picture, so what is going wrong here?
[00:58:26] <sw33tlull4by> http://nopaste.info/6bbbf3e355.html  <- the code
[00:59:06] <LSshock> for future use jsfiddle.net makes it much easier for people to tinker till it works
[00:59:27] <sw33tlull4by> will do
[01:05:22] <sw33tlull4by> and here is the repost for on jsfiddle http://jsfiddle.net/T5PfT/
[01:05:39] <sw33tlull4by> doesn't even show alerts though
[01:06:03] <sw33tlull4by> oh and I should say I am using jquerymobile as well
[01:10:06] <CodesStuff1> sw33tlull4by: Query_zip_city is not defined
[01:10:42] <sw33tlull4by> OK, then I am using jsfiddle wrong
[01:11:06] <sw33tlull4by> because when I run it it shows alerts and data but not the images
[01:11:08] <LSshock> select jquery on the side, dropdown
[01:11:11] <CodesStuff1> you're grabbing their GeoIP info with xmlhttpreq right?
[01:11:32] <CodesStuff1> wait nvm
[01:11:36] <CodesStuff1> i ust woke up
[01:11:36] <CodesStuff1> lol
[01:11:43] <sw33tlull4by> I use the androind simulator in connection with phonegap, not their geoip but I request data from a drupalserver yes
[01:12:40] <CodesStuff1> Have you considered just using MaxMind's free GeoIP services?
[01:13:17] <sw33tlull4by> no, not an option since I need the picture to be displayed
[01:16:05] <sw33tlull4by> i assume  an encodingproblem, with the url but seem unable to fix it
[01:16:21] <CodesStuff1> Well, one reason it won't work is because you're using .ajax() on jsfiddle
[01:16:35] <CodesStuff1> to a URL that doesn't exist
[01:16:46] <CodesStuff1> and for some reason it's not picking on Query_zip_city()
[01:17:01] <sw33tlull4by> url taken out on purpose
[01:17:06] <CodesStuff1> yeah
[01:19:17] <CodesStuff1> can you give me an example content of your test.php result?
[01:20:19] <sw33tlull4by> yeah hold on
[01:23:44] <CodesStuff1> just mention my name when you have it in a pastebin or something
[01:23:51] <CodesStuff1> I just need the json structure :P
[01:25:07] <sw33tlull4by> CodesStuff1 http://nopaste.info/229473a05b.html
[01:25:22] <sw33tlull4by> crap forgot an url
[01:25:25] <CodesStuff1> kk
[01:25:27] <CodesStuff1> oh
[01:25:28] <CodesStuff1> lol
[01:25:35] <CodesStuff1> just json_encode() an array :P
[01:26:06] <sw33tlull4by> I have no controle over the output, that is module in drupal doing it for me
[01:26:29] <CodesStuff1> Drupal ~_~
[01:26:48] <sw33tlull4by> it actually is a nice system, if you have enough time on your hands
[01:27:00] <CodesStuff1> the key is just "url" right?
[01:27:16] <sw33tlull4by> url and some parameters yes
[01:27:18] <sw33tlull4by> the selection works
[01:27:20] <sw33tlull4by> BUT
[01:27:42] <sw33tlull4by> parsesing the logo-url into the src-attribute of an imagetag does not work, the image stays empty
[01:28:05] <sw33tlull4by> doing it on the fly with a static image, works, so it really can't be my code
[01:28:11] <sw33tlull4by> or at least my
[01:28:14] <sw33tlull4by> going about things
[01:28:16] <CodesStuff1> well, normally the slashes on the URL's need to be escaped
[01:28:21] <CodesStuff1> but let me try messing with it
[01:28:24] <CodesStuff1> one minute :P
[01:28:28] <sw33tlull4by> thx
[01:28:58] <ravenzz> do you have a live demo of it?
[01:29:47] <sw33tlull4by> ravenzz live demo of what?
[01:30:09] <ravenzz> of whatever you are trying to do
[01:30:37] <ravenzz> the whole website or a testcase
[01:30:39] <ravenzz> ?testcase

[01:30:47] <ravenzz> faggbot
[01:30:51] <ravenzz> ?demo
[01:30:52] <bot-t> Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[01:31:03] <CodesStuff1> theres some sort of problem with your each loop lol
[01:31:24] <sw33tlull4by> I just want to query some information, which works, and I want to display the image the url is refering to and it does not work with the urls I get from the server
[01:31:26] <CodesStuff1> it just nearly crashed my browser and caused a "script running slowly" message w/ jquery.min.js
[01:32:31] <ravenzz> sw33tlull4by what is the source data, json?
[01:32:35] <sw33tlull4by> yes
[01:33:07] <ravenzz> can you at least paste it somewhere?
[01:33:43] <sw33tlull4by> http://nopaste.info/a9f75687d9.html
[01:33:47] <ravenzz> also what is your js?
[01:34:26] <ravenzz> ok dude
[01:34:29] <sw33tlull4by> jquery 1.7.2 jquery-modbile 1.1.1 cordova 2.0.0, I have say I do not belive this to be a phonegap problem
[01:34:31] <ravenzz> the logo is empty
[01:34:32] <ravenzz> :|
[01:34:48] <sw33tlull4by> that is why I am here ;)
[01:34:53] <ravenzz> ..
[01:34:58] <ravenzz> this is not a js problem
[01:35:13] <sw33tlull4by> ok then where can i find the problem?
[01:35:19] <ravenzz> do you get these data from an ajax request?
[01:35:24] <sw33tlull4by> yes
[01:35:27] <CodesStuff1> he's getting it from localhost
[01:35:54] <ravenzz> ok so you should take a look at the page's source you request
[01:36:32] <sw33tlull4by> the page generating the json or the page serving me the picture?
[01:36:38] <sw33tlull4by> ->the picture itself
[01:36:43] <sw33tlull4by> header and such?
[01:36:46] <ravenzz> generating the json
[01:36:56] <ravenzz> you don't have the url there :p
[01:37:17] <sw33tlull4by> it is a module in drupal generating the output for me
[01:37:25] <sw33tlull4by> so not much code there to see
[01:37:55] <ravenzz> ok it is not finding the logo url
[01:38:01] <ravenzz> so something is wrong
[01:38:09] <ravenzz> but, again, this is not a js question
[01:38:24] <ravenzz> ask on #drupal #web or #php
[01:38:25] <sw33tlull4by> the logourl is found, i can print it out it shows
[01:38:55] <sw33tlull4by> but parseing it into the src-attribute of the image tage, yields an empty image
[01:39:01] <ravenzz> man there is no logo's url in the json you sent me
[01:39:17] <ravenzz> sw33tlull4by show me the code!
[01:39:19] <ravenzz> or gtfo :D
[01:39:31] <ravenzz> we are not talking about ice creams
[01:39:42] <CodesStuff1> lol
[01:39:44] <ravenzz> i cannot help you without having a look at the code
[01:39:44] <sw33tlull4by> I pm you
[01:39:57] <CodesStuff1> are the json attributes static?
[01:40:03] <sw33tlull4by> no
[01:40:05] <CodesStuff1> eg "spezialitu00e4t"
[01:40:19] <CodesStuff1> okay
[01:40:24] <CodesStuff1> will there be any nested objects?
[01:40:25] <sw33tlull4by> oh that you mean
[01:40:33] <CodesStuff1> like, will the names be the same?
[01:40:33] <sw33tlull4by> yes they are static but the data is not late here
[01:41:49] <CodesStuff1> btw, have you considered using tmpl for this?
[01:42:07] <CodesStuff1> it looks a lot nicer than doing .html() + elements + fucking + everywhere
[01:43:25] <sw33tlull4by> the outputfield as no set structure it will depend on the amount of elements and the query taken place
[01:47:33] <CodesStuff1> I really hate you for using a " " space in postal code
[01:47:55] <sahbeewah> does the actual image tag get inserted into the dom?
[01:48:02] <sw33tlull4by> yes
[01:48:19] <sahbeewah> but there's no image?
[01:49:34] <sw33tlull4by> i create it as I go, i use $('#id').html($('#id').html()+'<img src="'.data.logo.'">');, i know append will work as well, but during this stage I like to do it as verbose as possible
[01:50:08] <CodesStuff1> well
[01:50:16] <CodesStuff1> you dont really even NEED the 2nd function
[01:50:52] <sw33tlull4by> yes I do, I will use this functionality somewhere else as well
[01:51:14] <sahbeewah> given it's a cross domain call, there may be security measures on the server to prevent leeching of images by hosts
[01:51:20] <sahbeewah> that's why the url works if you put it in the browser
[01:51:26] <CodesStuff1> ^^
[01:51:43] <sw33tlull4by> sahbeewah, I doubt it, i know the server
[01:52:49] <CodesStuff1> http://collabedit.com/cgd6d
[01:52:52] <CodesStuff1> There.
[01:53:13] <shadykhan> CodesStuff1, eats poop
[01:53:20] <CodesStuff1> That's testing on my localhost. "test.php" has the json you sent me, and the Cotnent-Type in the header of application/json

[01:55:12] <Mastermnd> Hi guys
[01:55:35] <CodesStuff1> hi.
[01:55:57] <Mastermnd> just joined to let you know all the jqueryUI theme links return a 404 since a few days ago. example: http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jqueryui/1.8.22/themes/base/jquery-ui.css
[01:56:11] <ravenzz> CodesStuff1 old :D
[01:56:31] <CodesStuff1> Yeah. It's not smart to use a third party for assets.
[01:56:44] <CodesStuff1> ALWAYS HOST IT ON YOUR MACHINE, OR PUT IT ON A CDN!1!1
[01:56:52] <sw33tlull4by> thank you both for your solutions I am trying the right know
[01:56:55] <Mastermnd> i know, but i want to download them
[01:57:16] <CodesStuff1> no sw33y
[01:57:54] <ravenzz> CodesStuff1 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nwd4zQrfM2A
[01:58:21] <Mastermnd> otherwise i have to download the full jqueryUI package many times and then just extract the themes
[01:58:24] <Mastermnd> would be a pain
[02:01:59] <Mastermnd> oh well, i guess i'll open a ticket
[02:02:01] <Mastermnd> meh

[02:14:26] <sw33tlull4by> thanks for your help, sort of doesn't work (think it is the emulator or something in my develenvironment) but I got some inspirations on how to tackle this thing in a different way. plus I am outta time right now, once again racenzz and CodesStuff1, thank you for your help
[02:14:45] <CodesStuff1> no problem sw33tlull4by - good luck!
[02:15:20] <sw33tlull4by> thank you
[02:15:34] <fatmandown> yees?
[02:15:45] <CodesStuff1> your site is straight out of 1997 xD
[02:16:10] <CodesStuff1> anyways, toss it up in a jsfiddle
[02:16:20] <fatmandown> yeah, i'm a retro kinda guy. i'll throw it up there nowish
[02:20:21] <souske> is there any good reliable jquery chart?
[02:20:38] <ruby_on_tails> jquery chart ?
[02:20:45] <ruby_on_tails> highcharts if html5 would do
[02:21:41] <souske> I would gadly use html5, but you know the drill. users using old browsers.
[02:21:53] <souske> gladly*
[02:21:55] <CodesStuff1> svg?
[02:22:20] <ruby_on_tails> html5 works in old browsers i guess, they have the support
[02:22:21] <ruby_on_tails> check it out
[02:22:50] <souske> oh I didn't know, will do. thanks.
[02:23:08] <ruby_on_tails> i meant highcharts works in old browser*

[03:13:21] <joaojeronimo> I'm trying to make an XHR with CORS, my server is ready for it and I attempted to do it well without jquery's .ajax, but now I can't do it.. Is there any configuration I need to add so it can do the preflight OPTIONS request ?
[03:14:08] <joaojeronimo> also, do GET and HEAD requests also need a preflight OPTIONS, or is it only POST, PUT and DELETE ?
[03:26:14] <timini> How can I covert a string of html into DOM ?
[03:27:33] <joaojeronimo> timini: I think you should first create the element and then fill it with $(element).html("<strong>stuff</strong>")
[03:28:03] <joaojeronimo> timini, and then finally attach that element to the DOM.
[03:29:01] <joaojeronimo> timini, if you do all the manipulations to the element before attaching it to the DOM you'll save reflows (the browser having to render the document everytime you change the element)

[04:02:49] <Maffelu> After dropping a draggable in a droppable I get a delay before I can drag something again, is this normal?
[04:08:10] <CodesStuff1> Maffelu: say what you just said out loud 10 times fast
[04:08:16] <CodesStuff1> its impossible
[04:09:53] <Maffelu> Right. So I'm dragging this div and then dropping it. After that there is a (more or less) 2-3 second delay before I can drag something again. Better?
[04:10:44] <CodesStuff1> xD
[04:10:52] <CodesStuff1> is there a timer?
[04:11:02] <CodesStuff1> or maybe a var isnt being cleared
[04:13:52] <Maffelu> hm?
[04:14:49] <CodesStuff1> do you have a var that checks to see if something is being dragged
[04:14:57] <CodesStuff1> and maybe it's not clearing?
[04:15:59] <Maffelu> CodesStuff1, well, no. I just listen to the drop event, nothing weird.
[04:16:52] <CodesStuff1> Odd. Got a link/fiddle?
[04:17:34] <CodesStuff1> Also, google gave me this http://www.webdeveloperjuice.com/2010/01/07/drag-and-drop-performance-in-jquery-is-slow-here-is-the-fix/
[04:19:04] <Maffelu> CodesStuff1, yea I read that but I don't think that's it. It's not slow, as much as I try to click on my draggables there is no response until after at least 3-4 clicks
[04:19:19] <Maffelu> I don't have a link though, it's a facebook application I'm trying to make with jquery
[04:20:26] <CodesStuff1> Hmm. Well, you can't link me to the Canvas page?
[04:20:43] <CodesStuff1> So long as it doesn't require authentication I'll take a peek. I don't own a FB account
[04:22:19] <Maffelu> it requires authentication :/
[04:22:52] <Maffelu> well, the weird thing is actually that I had the same problem using the new .on() method to bind a click event to the same divs
[04:23:06] <Maffelu> also took a couple of clicks after an initial click to click on it again
[04:26:24] <CodesStuff1> hmm
[04:26:31] <CodesStuff1> maybe it's facebook's connect js?
[04:26:41] <CodesStuff1> some kind of like, conflict
[04:51:32] <jianmeng> is there anyone used css 'zoom' to zoom in a absolute position div?
[04:53:09] <jianmeng> I do not know how a child element change in order to keep zoom effect.
[04:55:06] <jianmeng> It seem the dimension of  absolute positioned  div do not change after I set its parent div zoom value.
[04:56:46] <jianmeng> is there need a javascript calculated size&postion change in order to make child element work properly?
[05:03:32] <muay-guy> Hi, how do I change all links that are currently linking to "mydomain.com/search/site/whateverquery" to "mydomain.com/search/content/whateverquery"?

[05:06:45] <minttus> iPhone haha
[05:07:13] <minttus> Wazza i meant
[05:09:06] <minttus> Everyone dead ?
[05:09:22] <alexandermcgill> Hello
[05:10:54] <minttus> Finally :)
[05:11:46] <Maffelu> muay-guy, use notepad++ and replace-all?
[05:12:20] <alexandermcgill> I'm new to jquery, can someone help me make a small tool that takes bits of text from multiple <input> tags and spits them out into a bit of html that people can paste into a wordpress post
[05:12:21] <muay-guy> Maffelu: they show up dynamically
[05:12:26] <muay-guy> I want to do it with jquery
[05:12:51] <Maffelu> do they all share some common identifier? Like class or something?
[05:13:53] <muay-guy> Maffelu: they have either class "facetapi-inactive" or "facetapi-active"
[05:13:58] <alexandermcgill> They're wrapped in a div with id of "options"
[05:15:21] <Maffelu> well, whenever you generate these links just run $('.facetapi.inactive, .facetapi-active').text().replace('site', 'content);
[05:20:40] <sahbeewah> why is it generating links to search queries?
[05:22:17] <muay-guy> Maffelu: strange, it's not working for whatever reason
[05:22:50] <Maffelu> whatever reason is probably what's breaking it. Are you running a console log on it?
[05:23:07] <muay-guy> OH,… I know what it could be… I think it's just a typo: site instead of sites
[05:26:26] <sahbeewah> it's not working because it's wrong
[05:27:09] <muay-guy> sahbeewah: what do you mean?
[05:29:28] <sahbeewah> are the "links" you're talking about anchor tags?
[05:30:40] <muay-guy> sahbeewah: yeah
[05:32:30] <sahbeewah> $('.facetapi.inactive, .facetapi-active').each(function(element) { $(this).attr('href', $(this).attr('href').replace('/site/', '/content/')); });​​​​​​​​​​​​​
[05:34:20] <Maffelu> right
[05:34:53] <muay-guy> sahbeewah: yeap… that did the trick
[05:35:26] <muay-guy> thanks guys
[05:35:54] <solidus-river> is there an event that an dom element sets off when its fully loaded?
[05:39:17] <Maffelu> solidus-river, .ready()?
[05:40:19] <solidus-river> i'm trying to bind a handler to be called whenever a dom element enters the page that matches a certain filter
[05:40:48] <johnkpaul> solidus-river: there are the dommutation apis, but they are slow and not in every browser
[05:40:59] <johnkpaul> if you don't care about IE - http://code.google.com/p/mutation-summary/
[05:41:10] <LSshock> Hi everyone, i'm trying to filter out plain tekst bbcode and so far its going alright but my each() part stops after the first. Wondering if anyone can tell me why http://jsfiddle.net/ideaprison/evtns/55/ thanks!
[05:41:22] <johnkpaul> but I'd actually recommend attempting to change how you accomplish your end goal, do you not have control over when elements are added to the dom?
[05:41:37] <johnkpaul> also solidus-river, in the worst case, look into jquery live query
[05:41:43] <johnkpaul> ?g livequery jquery @ solidus-river
[05:41:44] <bot-t> solidus-river, Plugins/livequery - jQuery JavaScript Library - http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/livequery
[05:44:58] <solidus-river> wow, live query hasn't been touched in 2 years
[05:45:05] <solidus-river> is there a better solution or is it just somethign that works
[05:45:28] <BinaryKitten> solidus-river it's not needed anymore
[05:45:41] <solidus-river> whats the replacement for it?
[05:46:12] <BinaryKitten> well there is none that binds when an element enters a apge
[05:46:13] <BinaryKitten> page
[05:46:15] <BinaryKitten> but
[05:46:31] <BinaryKitten> you can bind to the parent with an element filter to create delegation
[05:46:58] <solidus-river> and that can be done when somethign enters the page? not to an event on something?
[05:47:00] <BinaryKitten> eg $('parentSelector').on('event', 'matchingselector', fn(){})
[05:47:05] <solidus-river> so i should look into .delegate
[05:47:14] <solidus-river> BinaryKitten: right, i want to do it on entry not an event
[05:47:34] <BinaryKitten> solidus-river what are you wanting to do to the item "when it enters" ?
[05:47:54] <sahbeewah> LSshock: http://jsfiddle.net/evtns/57/ ?
[05:48:47] <LSshock> sahbeewah: ?
[05:49:03] <solidus-river> BinaryKitten: i have ajax callbacks, i would like to call an initialization function for a javascript graph using d3 in sucha  way that when a dom element enters the page with the matching class a function gets called that takes it and initializes d3 inside
[05:49:15] <sahbeewah> LSshock: is that the effect you were trying to achieve?
[05:49:48] <LSshock> im not sure what you did besides removing part of it
[05:50:47] <BinaryKitten> that's not really easy to muster. how are you injecting the new html?
[05:51:22] <solidus-river> BinaryKitten: ajax
[05:51:29] <LSshock> it is suppose to use each [wiki] to build the div, though this is only half of it, but it should become empty which visually tells you that it has run the each() code on both [wiki]
[05:51:47] <BinaryKitten> solidus-river that's not how, that's the tool
[05:52:02] <solidus-river> oh, right, i guess i could just set it up as a callback or at the end of the injection function
[05:52:14] <BinaryKitten> are you using .ajax  .get .post .load a.n.other method
[05:52:46] <solidus-river> .get, but i get what your getting at, i could use .success to run a function that initializes it
[05:52:47] <b-ot> solidus-river, definitely being used as one ;)
[05:52:52] <LSshock> sahbeewah: so it needs to run the each() code on both, but its only doing it once
[05:52:58] <LSshock> and cant seem to figure out why
[05:53:18] <sahbeewah> You're running "each" on the body
[05:53:21] <sahbeewah> there's only one body
[05:53:26] <BinaryKitten> solidus-river if ($(yourhtml).find('selector').length > 0) { runfn(); }
[05:53:44] <LSshock> hmpf
[05:54:33] <LSshock> but in my other one for youtube embed http://jsfiddle.net/ideaprison/ULzK7/ it works
[05:55:54] <LSshock> maybe im blind and i messed the two up
[05:55:56] <sahbeewah> yeah that's not doing what you think it's doing
[05:56:11] <LSshock> oh?
[05:56:23] <sahbeewah> it just happened to get the result you wanted
[05:56:28] <BinaryKitten> http://jsfiddle.net/evtns/58/ <-- update to the wikicode
[05:56:29] <LSshock> that would explain it
[05:57:25] <BinaryKitten> no point wrapping this twice
[05:57:35] <BinaryKitten> especially as .html takes a function
[05:57:55] <LSshock> later it would use each post content
[05:58:51] <BinaryKitten> that's still the same code
[05:59:13] <BinaryKitten> $('.post_content').wikicode(); would still work with v58
[05:59:21] <LSshock> yeah but where can i put the code to get the text of the [wiki]
[05:59:25] <LSshock> i know its a miracle i got this far
[06:00:11] <BinaryKitten> LSshock how do you mean?
[06:00:20] <BinaryKitten> (brb need quick dash)
[06:00:39] <LSshock> sorry im talking about my original code here http://jsfiddle.net/ideaprison/evtns/55/
[06:00:40] <LSshock> sure thing
[06:01:46] * BinaryKitten looks
[06:02:43] <circlicious> i need a proper plugin to help me bind events to keybindings like a function call to ctrl+s, any suggestions?
[06:03:03] <BinaryKitten> ah you want all the text between the [wiki][/wiki]
[06:03:11] <LSshock> yes
[06:03:22] <BinaryKitten> circlicious i have one
[06:03:25] <LSshock> so i can get hte info and build the info block where it originally was
[06:03:27] <BinaryKitten> it mostly works
[06:03:52] <circlicious> i tried john resig's hotkeys, but that seems crap
[06:03:58] <LSshock> my full code is longer of course, and works on the first only just like that fiddle
[06:04:23] <BinaryKitten> circlicious: http://binarykitten.com/js/259-jquery-keyz-plugin.html
[06:04:30] <BinaryKitten> as i said, not perfect
[06:04:45] <BinaryKitten> missing a few bits and pieces i wanted to add but does the basics
[06:05:59] <BinaryKitten> circlicious what you would do is bind to the S key
[06:06:04] <circlicious> BinaryKitten: does it work with ctrl+s, shift+ctrl+s ? i mean can i bind to those?
[06:06:10] <BinaryKitten> then if (!ctl) { return; }
[06:06:25] <circlicious> i see
[06:06:29] <BinaryKitten> it's been a couple of years since i looked at that code
[06:06:37] <circlicious> years, lol :D
[06:06:41] <BinaryKitten> sorry, been really really busy
[06:07:01] <BinaryKitten> but i'm tempted to relook at it later this evening now :D
[06:07:10] <BinaryKitten> see what i can do and bring it upto date
[06:07:57] <BinaryKitten> LSshock: ok
[06:08:07] <LSshock> yes
[06:08:27] <BinaryKitten> so, we got it updating the html properly
[06:08:40] <BinaryKitten> now what do you need to happen to each wikisearch?
[06:08:48] <LSshock> a lot
[06:08:54] <LSshock> want to see my full code for this?
[06:09:09] <LSshock> gives a better idea
[06:09:14] <BinaryKitten> ok
[06:09:35] * BinaryKitten is working on http://jsfiddle.net/ideaprison/evtns/55/
[06:09:54] <LSshock> well this is just teh code, but this code came form a fiddle that did work
[06:10:09] <LSshock> i cant remember what number i had a working one sorry but this should help http://jsfiddle.net/evtns/
[06:10:37] <LSshock> basically get the keywords, and i had a check to see if there was a hash tag which indicates a section in the article
[06:11:03] <LSshock> then base of that would be for the url to get the right wiki page
[06:11:16] <LSshock> if there was a hash than that would be used to find the right section using nextuntil
[06:11:24] <LSshock> since the wiki page does not wrap anything into clear divs
[06:13:01] <LSshock> sorry i cant find the one where it worked with the first [wiki] im so stupid, gosh, well here is the older one where you have to click the link
[06:13:07] <LSshock> but it shows how i was trying to do this http://jsfiddle.net/ideaprison/evtns/38/
[06:14:07] <BinaryKitten> LSshock gotcha
[06:14:08] <BinaryKitten> :)
[06:14:12] <LSshock> phew!
[06:15:49] <bnb_dev> Hello All!
[06:16:56] <bnb_dev> is there any best jquery plugins, That hide/show more text  like Facebook ?
[06:17:05] <bnb_dev> or whatever
[06:18:27] <bnb_dev> and also respect the new line and white spaces
[06:19:33] <LSshock> im not even sure how facebook does that (like i never encountered text that needed expanding)
[06:20:01] <LSshock> do you mean the load more posts type of thing? or really a text block
[06:20:10] <BinaryKitten> LSshock are these in some sort of tooltip?
[06:20:29] <BinaryKitten> i mean the datawiki for each wikisearch?
[06:20:53] <LSshock> no this is for a forum where we cant edit the php
[06:21:08] <BinaryKitten> ?
[06:21:13] <LSshock> so it sees the fake bbcode tag and puts the info there
[06:21:21] <BinaryKitten> oh
[06:21:28] <LSshock> did you see the "working" one
[06:21:38] <LSshock> where you have to click the text
[06:21:48] <BinaryKitten> so it replaces the content of [wiki][/wiki] with the load?
[06:21:52] <LSshock> yes
[06:22:00] <LSshock> so the info gets to be on the exact same spot
[06:22:00] <BinaryKitten> now i got you
[06:35:59] <LSshock> sorry BinaryKitten something went wrong here
[06:36:16] <LSshock> i'm fully operational again now
[06:39:42] <BinaryKitten> LSshock http://jsfiddle.net/evtns/60/
[06:40:58] <LSshock> .wikisearch {border:1px solid salmon; height:200px; overflow:scroll;}
[06:41:02] <LSshock> looks good
[06:41:06] <BinaryKitten> LSshock that loads all of the entries
[06:41:06] <LSshock> thanks already
[06:41:13] <LSshock> merci
[06:41:23] <BinaryKitten> ne pas de problem
[06:41:26] <LSshock> how do you think my way of loading a section looks like
[06:41:41] <LSshock> its the only way i could come up with
[06:41:49] <BinaryKitten> the loading...?
[06:42:08] <LSshock> no the nextuntil part
[06:42:17] <BinaryKitten> nextuntil?
[06:42:53] <LSshock> http://jsfiddle.net/ideaprison/evtns/38/ $('.result').append($('#' + $hash).parent().nextUntil($('#' + $next).parent()).html());
[06:43:21] <LSshock> its in the load part
[06:43:41] <BinaryKitten> which lines?
[06:43:56] <skyzo> hey all
[06:44:14] <BinaryKitten> LSshock ah i see
[06:44:20] <BinaryKitten> i don't particularly like it..
[06:44:34] <BinaryKitten> i'm not a fan of loading content and stripping it like that
[06:44:42] <BinaryKitten> do that on your php script
[06:45:06] <BinaryKitten> also add some caching to your php script
[06:45:15] <BinaryKitten> so multiple requests don't have to wait as long
[06:45:53] <LSshock> that might be better yes
[06:46:05] <BinaryKitten> easier too
[06:46:13] <circlicious> anyone used hotkeys?
[06:46:19] <BinaryKitten> if something changes you don't have to refigure it out
[06:46:26] <circlicious> or
[06:46:47] <BinaryKitten> circlicious can't you read how i implemented the binding and try and follow suit?
[06:46:53] <circlicious> when the focus is in an iframe, document.onkeydown on the parent's document wont trigger on some key type, is there some way to fix that?
[06:47:07] <BinaryKitten> ah no
[06:47:17] <BinaryKitten> i frame issues
[06:47:34] <LSshock> BinaryKitten you are right, php is not my field so i will for now use this but get my friend to write up some proper code for the php
[06:47:44] <LSshock> thanks for your help, you're great
[06:47:45] <BinaryKitten> circlicious you're not in the parent document
[06:47:54] <LSshock> hope you have a great weekend
[06:47:55] <BinaryKitten> so the parent document can't receive that event
[06:47:59] <BinaryKitten> np LSshock
[06:48:01] <BinaryKitten> you too
[06:48:06] <LSshock> thanks :)
[06:48:22] <BinaryKitten> bonne chance! et bon apres midi
[06:48:27] <circlicious> BinaryKitten: someone said this plugin fxes it - https://github.com/Pomax/KeyTrap.js/blob/master/keytrap.js - i read the code but cant see how
[06:48:43] <circlicious> unfortunately it doesnt seems to be easy to implement so i cant test the plkugin :/
[06:48:46] <circlicious> let me try actually
[06:48:56] <BinaryKitten> circlicious yes that would
[06:49:01] <BinaryKitten> but not cross document
[06:49:05] <BinaryKitten> only in that document
[06:49:23] <BinaryKitten> you can't here events in an iframe
[06:52:21] <spanglesontoast> anyone know what I'm doing wrong here http://pastebin.com/hXdMdY3W seems to untick boxes when they are checked :S
[07:03:21] <sahbeewah> what is that meant to do?
[07:05:13] <spanglesontoast> mean't to pause the refresh if any of the checkboxes are checked
[07:06:15] <circlicious> BinaryKitten: if you can make an awesome plugin that can properly support ctrl+s, ctrl+shift+s and maybe even accept events on document from child iframes , would be cool :P
[07:06:27] <circlicious> i mena improve upon what you have, for now i will manage with hotkeys :/
[07:06:39] <circlicious> it doesnt seems to support shift+ctrl+s , 3 of them, meh :/
[07:06:53] <BinaryKitten> circlicious sorry can't be done
[07:07:05] <BinaryKitten> mainly as you can't hook events from iframe
[07:07:09] <BinaryKitten> they are not children
[07:07:21] <BinaryKitten> they are their own document/window environment
[07:07:39] <circlicious> hotkeys doesnt even work with binding to ctrl+n :|
[07:07:48] <circlicious> opens new tab in chrome
[07:07:59] <sahbeewah> spanglesontoast: what does the >* do? i've never seen that
[07:08:11] <spanglesontoast> no idea i'm no pro at javascript unfort
[07:09:14] <BinaryKitten> sahbeewah All direct children
[07:09:58] * BinaryKitten disappears off
[07:10:13] <sahbeewah> all direct children of what?
[07:10:15] <sahbeewah> the url?
[07:10:55] <sahbeewah> anyway i don't think you can pause a refresh
[07:11:08] <sahbeewah> apart from using the onbeforeunload handler
[07:12:21] <spanglesontoast> sahbeewah: well it just doesn't invoke that action if they checkbox is checked... I thought
[07:13:02] <circlicious> does mac have the alt key?
[07:14:25] <sahbeewah> what action are you trying to prevent?
[07:14:32] <sahbeewah> is #refresh a button which refreshes the page?
[07:15:33] <spanglesontoast> nope it's the <div> to rfresh
[07:16:30] <spanglesontoast> *refresh
[07:17:30] <LSshock> Might be a weird question but does this count down to 20days 17hrs 42min xsecs for you all too? >> http://jsfiddle.net/ideaprison/N2ZuK/
[07:17:57] <LSshock> i should be more specific im trying to duplicate this count down www.guildwars2.com
[07:18:06] <LSshock> mine is 2 hours off for my timezone
[07:18:12] <Salvager__> what does this do? $('#of_form :input[name][name!="security"][name!="of_reset"]').serialize();
[07:18:15] <LSshock> so the fiddle is 2hours behind on the main site
[07:18:19] <spanglesontoast> LSshock: 1 hr off
[07:18:25] <LSshock> UK?
[07:18:31] <Salvager__> i know what serialize do but dont understand the form selection syntax
[07:18:46] <LSshock> spanglesontoast: is it the same as on www.guildwars2.com for you
[07:19:04] <sahbeewah> spanglesontoast: I can't see how you're trying to achieve that, but once you get that to valid jquery, ":checked" not "checked:" it's going to be sending off ajax requests at 30msec intervals
[07:19:08] <spanglesontoast> LSshock: nope
[07:19:14] <sahbeewah> endlessly
[07:19:57] <LSshock> then i should ask if anyone has a clue what im doing wrong | http://jsfiddle.net/ideaprison/N2ZuK/ | anyone know whats going wrong with my countdown? thanks
[07:20:33] <spanglesontoast> LSshock: detect the client's timezone first and adjust to match
[07:21:04] <LSshock> do you mean the −8?
[07:21:14] <LSshock> thats for the pacific timezone its counting down to
[07:21:30] <sahbeewah> Salvager__: it's finding inputs that are descendants of #of_form which have a name attribute, that aren't equal to "security" or "of_reset" and serializing them
[07:22:12] <Salvager__> allright thanks
[07:31:08] <LSshock> what about now http://jsfiddle.net/ideaprison/N2ZuK/ VS www.guildwars2.com (talking about the countdown)
[07:37:16] <saml> hey, <input id="submit" type="submit">  $('#submit').click(function()..  how can I get <form>  from $this) ?
[07:38:05] <LSshock> i think the main website is not counting off the same day as i am or something else is off
[07:38:25] <NodeX> saml .. $(this).parents('form')
[07:38:58] <saml> NodeX, thanks.  is it better to do  $('#form').submit(..  instead of $('#submit').click ?
[07:39:24] <NodeX> depends if you want to trap the submit or not
[07:39:53] <saml> yah i want to trap. i'll use .submit
[07:40:03] <NodeX> I use submit()
[08:01:04] <Rafa> Hello peoples
[09:10:20] <Gorkyman> hum, how do I return response data from getScript() callback function ?
[09:12:14] <AnonymousPrime> Gorkyman response data = the script content that was retrieved from url?
[11:23:15] <rburton-> Anyone available for a small side project?
[11:23:28] <rburton-> e.g., 1 days worth of work
[11:25:02] <BinaryKitten> rburton- what's the budget?
[11:25:13] <BinaryKitten> and rburton- what's the deadline
[11:27:16] <rburton-> BinaryKitten: A private message? I'll describe the project and you can tell me what it would cost?
[11:27:26] <BinaryKitten> ok
[11:28:21] <Parhs> hello guys ,  i have implemented a custom gallery... i have description textarea under each image
[11:28:40] <Parhs> i want it to update description via ajax like facebook..
[11:29:02] <Parhs> i noticed that it does it when you loose focus from textarea.. which event should i hook for this ?
[11:29:25] <Parhs> even if you click at another link
[12:03:05] <fdv> Hi guys and gals, I've been looking for an ajax file upload plugin or tool, multi-file-upload is optional for me. I've seen several, and found a listing of a couple of years ago, but I was wondering if anybody had any recommendations?
[12:06:25] <BinaryKitten> jquerify
[12:06:29] <sonotos> fdv: http://blueimp.github.com/jQuery-File-Upload/
[12:06:33] <BinaryKitten> but most won't use ajax
[12:06:43] <BinaryKitten> since it gets messy
[12:13:25] <sonotos> why messy?
[12:13:55] <fdv> BinaryKitten: I'm sorry, I can't seem to find any upload plugin with that name, seems the most known jquerify-named app is a bookmarklet
[12:14:05] <fdv> sonotos: that seems very nice indeed
[12:14:20] <fdv> I was also curious about the messy part
[12:14:23] <sonotos> fdv: supports even drag & drop
[12:14:43] <BinaryKitten> fdv .. sorry http://www.uploadify.com/
[12:14:54] <sonotos> hm depends on the implementation
[12:15:15] <fdv> I can see the mix of flash, silverlight, iframes and html5 as being "messy", but I'm not sure if that's what you mean
[12:15:23] <sonotos> like magic...
[12:15:50] <fdv> BinaryKitten: ah, I've already looked at that. it seems nice, indeed.
[12:16:20] <fdv> sonotos, BinaryKitten: thanks a lot
[12:16:31] <BinaryKitten> by messy i mean that file uploads generally need to work with browser postback
[12:16:35] <sonotos> have phun
[12:16:44] <BinaryKitten> most browsers don't allow access to the file input data
[12:16:52] <BinaryKitten> especially not the actual file on the system
[12:17:01] <BinaryKitten> it becomes a headache
[12:17:07] <sonotos> for a good reason
[12:17:12] <BinaryKitten> yep
[12:17:14] <fdv> you mean regarding metadata?
[12:17:23] <BinaryKitten> regarding actual data
[12:17:27] <sonotos> i would have more headache if they would do
[12:17:35] <BinaryKitten> sonotos agreed
[12:17:36] <Parhs> fdv plupload is good
[12:20:05] <fdv> Parhs: yeah, I looked at that one, too. also seemingly a nice alternative. thanks.
[12:21:46] <Parhs> i have used it for a custom image selecting thing
[12:22:03] <Parhs> if you want to see it in action tell me
[12:22:19] <fdv> license is a potential issue with plupload and uploadify, though
[12:22:32] <fdv> by all means, they're not expensive
[12:22:52] <fdv> but blueimp's is MIT
[12:23:01] <Parhs> plupload doesnt charge for html5
[12:23:07] <fdv> no, I saw that
[12:23:38] <fdv> no, sorry, I didn't see that
[12:23:42] <fdv> I mixed up
[12:24:05] <fdv> Parhs: afaics, it's GPLv2
[12:24:23] <sonotos> hm http://www.plupload.com looks very interesting
[12:24:24] <Parhs> yep , i am not sure if this means that you can use it
[12:25:05] <fdv> then you need to release the rest of the code under >= GPLv2 as well, I guess
[12:25:30] <Parhs> http://parhs.no-ip.org/admin/staticpage/FE_homepage/edit     admin | adminpass
[12:26:01] <sonotos> well 120$ for oem is not that much
[12:26:01] <BinaryKitten> use is ok
[12:26:28] <sonotos> cheaper than to build it myself or pay somebody
[12:26:30] <fdv> BinaryKitten: sorry, I'm still a bit unclear. are you saying the upload mechanism works differently with ajax? afaics, you still POST the request containing multipart data?
[12:26:31] <BinaryKitten> if you include it in anything that is not private usage that has to get released under GPLv2
[12:26:58] <BinaryKitten> fdv, you can but accessing the files for upload is the issue
[12:27:39] <sonotos> seems like you just can upload files and not complete forms
[12:28:14] <fdv> BinaryKitten: which can be done using flash or html5, right?
[12:28:54] <Parhs> it adds hidden for files
[12:29:03] <Parhs> you should do something for orphans though..
[12:29:06] <BinaryKitten> flash yes. Html5 i'm unsure about .. not sure how it does it
[12:29:13] <fdv> me neither
[12:29:19] <fdv> or you can use an ifram
[12:29:21] <fdv> +e
[12:29:32] <fdv> but then you don't really use ajax, I guess
[12:29:39] * BinaryKitten likes iframe target
[12:30:02] <fdv> mhm.
[12:31:36] <sonotos> fdv: there are more ways than the xhttprequest for implementing ajax
[12:32:27] <sonotos> you can read the content from an iframe or append new <script tags to the head
[12:33:20] <fdv> I'll have to admit I'm a bit unclear what the precise definition of ajax is
[12:33:50] <fdv> Parhs: I really liked that implementation. the image grid, is that a stock plupload thing?
[12:34:19] <fdv> Parhs: they currently have an image title, can you add custom fields?
[12:34:33] <fdv> it seems very similar to what I need to build
[13:06:55] <digs> So, I am confused and can't do what I want. if($(this).find('input').each.val() == '') { // do something } -- The way I read this, is that if each input value in this div is empty, do something.
[13:07:08] <digs> What am I am missing syntax wise to make that happen?
[13:07:32] <digs> I just want to know if every input value within a given div is empty.
[13:14:23] <BinaryKitten> digs
[13:14:55] <johnkpaul> digs: .each is a function, that function has no property called val
[13:15:39] <johnkpaul> I think you want $(this).find('input').filter(function(i,el){return el.value ==""}).length == 0
[13:16:01] <BinaryKitten> if($(this).find('input').filter(function(){return this.value.length =0; }).length > 0) { /** do something */ }
[13:16:40] <BinaryKitten> ah yes johnkpaul  should have been el in param not this
[13:17:05] <johnkpaul> BinaryKitten: this would have worked as well
[13:17:22] <BinaryKitten> also i think that it would have needed a bit more
[13:17:34] <johnkpaul> I just like being explicit :)
[13:18:04] <BinaryKitten> return this.value.length==0 && this.getAttribute('type').toLowerCase() !== 'submit';
[13:18:35] * BinaryKitten returns to nomming her pizza
[13:22:22] <myrman> Hello, I would like to purchase one jQuery please
[13:23:48] <BinaryKitten> ok myrman that will be 1 thousand millicents. oh there's a discount of 1 cent today.
[13:24:20] <myrman> I only have this binary currency, is that okay?
[13:24:36] <BinaryKitten> hmm 0
[13:29:28] <digs> johnkpaul, thanks... let me try that... my irc client wasn't scrolling so I didn't see your answer until now.
[13:32:25] <digs> I don't know... that is not working either. It seems to always be true and hence always doing something. Here is a variation I was working on:
[13:32:52] <digs> $(this + ":input").each(function(){  if(!$(this).val())  empty = false; });
[13:33:00] <digs> but that doesn't work either.
[13:33:12] <shoky> digs:  this + ":input" doesnt make much sense
[13:33:23] <shoky> unless you're iterating through an array of selectors or something
[13:33:27] <digs> Really, I just need a flag to know if all inputs are empty, then bail out of the function if they are.
[13:33:58] <digs> shoky, sorry, I am just been on google for like 45 minutes trying anything that resembles what I want to do.
[13:34:21] <digs> I was modeling it off this: http://stackoverflow.com/a/6781531/1066659
[13:34:35] <digs> but abonded the .map because it was not working.
[13:34:36] <myrman> Thank you BinaryKitten, when can I expect a jQuery? And does it come with JavaScript?
[13:34:37] <shoky> digs jkp had the right idea,
[13:35:01] <digs> okay... well that works... but it works no matter if there are any inputs filled in or not.
[13:35:03] <shoky> you want: $(this).find('input').filter(function(){return this.value ==""}).length == 0
[13:35:13] * digs trys
[13:35:52] <shoky> that is:   if ($(this).find('input').filter(function(){return this.value ==""}).length == 0) { // do something }
[13:37:55] <shoky> wait
[13:37:58] <shoky> .find('input') ?
[13:38:06] <shoky> that looks for <input> tags
[13:38:07] <shoky> :P
[13:38:30] <shoky> so you were on the right track with ':input'
[13:38:43] <shoky> if ($(this).find(':input').filter(function(){return this.value ==""}).length == 0) { // do something }
[13:38:58] <shoky> digs ^
[13:39:06] * digs looks
[13:41:33] <digs> http://dev.fdanconia.com/los/upload/webform -- Click on one address block.. then click on another. - You notice it does all sorts of stuff. I want to know if all those fields in an address block are empty by setting a flag. (Then I can bail out on the rest of the stuff.)
[13:42:21] <digs> Right now, if I implement any of these solutions, it _always_ sets the flag to true (true meaning that all fields are empty and don't do the other stuff)
[13:42:59] <shoky> what is 'this' ?
[13:43:10] <shoky> your original 'this' ?
[13:43:28] <digs> I mean, I could check each one manually... with 13 lines of code. but i want to loop through. 'this' = $('div.address').each
[13:43:40] <digs> the parent div container of each address block.
[13:44:34] <digs> Actually. I just reailzed... this function is for ALL addresses :/
[13:44:43] <digs> because of the .each.
[13:44:47] <shoky> hm?
[13:45:10] <digs> one sec.
[13:47:05] <digs> http://jsfiddle.net/yWasZ/ -- there is the JS.
[13:48:05] <digs> and line 5 is where I want to see if all the fields in the focused div are empty. Because I don't want to process the div or validate all the fields if the address is completely empty.
[13:48:41] <shoky> why do you do:  var empty = false;  if (!empty) { ... }
[13:49:07] <digs> Ideally...
[13:49:11] <shoky> dude
[13:49:14] <shoky> ideally?
[13:49:18] <shoky> ideally what
[13:49:31] <digs> I want to set empty = true; - check each field for being empty -- if(!empty) continue.
[13:49:37] <shoky> that is the same as saying:  if (true) { ... }
[13:49:43] <digs> I know.
[13:49:48] <shoky> but you're only setting that INSIDE the if block :\
[13:49:50] <digs> For now I set it like that so the code works.
[13:49:57] <shoky> er you're not
[13:50:02] <digs> You are confused.
[13:50:03] <shoky> nvm
[13:50:04] <digs> Let me update.
[13:50:12] <shoky> why wouldn't i be :)
[13:50:16] <shoky> var empty = false;  if (!empty) { ... }
[13:50:17] <shoky> makes no sense
[13:50:27] <digs> http://jsfiddle.net/yWasZ/1/
[13:50:30] <digs> there.
[13:50:43] <shoky> now it makes even less sense......
[13:50:52] <digs> what?
[13:51:00] <shoky> now it's the same as  if (false) { ... }
[13:51:07] <digs> are you reading the comments?
[13:51:20] <shoky> code is what gets turn
[13:51:22] <digs> the comments is where I need help.
[13:51:23] <shoky> gets run*
[13:51:27] <digs> I knowl.
[13:51:38] <digs> I am saying the comments is where I am putting your code and it is not working.
[13:51:51] <digs> The comment is where I need code to check to see if each input field is empty.
[13:51:54] <shoky> ok
[13:52:01] <shoky> the comments don't say that ;P
[13:52:05] <digs> sorry.
[13:52:10] <digs> I wasn't clear enough.
[13:52:18] <shoky> i thought they were talking about what goes on inside the if block
[13:52:30] <digs> ohhhh I can see how you would think that. Sorry.
[13:53:04] <shoky> well, it's time to debug and run stuff in your console
[13:53:52] <shoky> for example: jQuery('.address').eq(0).find(':input').filter(function() {return this.value == ""})
[13:54:19] <shoky> shows you all inputs in the first .address block whose value is empty
[13:54:32] <digs> Okay.
[13:54:51] <shoky> and if you change that == to !=
[13:54:57] <shoky> you get all inputs whose value is not empty
[13:55:32] <shoky> hm
[13:55:42] <shoky> so that line seems to work ok
[13:55:45] <shoky> er
[13:56:44] <shoky> var empty = $(this).find(':input').filter(function(){return this.value ==""}).length == 0;
[13:56:49] <shoky> that should work i think
[13:58:14] <shoky> wtf i thought before there were no <input> tags. i must be drunk or smth
[13:58:49] <shoky> oops dude.
[13:59:15] <shoky>  var empty = $(this).find(':input').filter(function(){return this.value != ""}).length == 0;
[13:59:18] <shoky> digs ^ ;)
[13:59:37] <digs> Let me try that.
[14:01:39] <shoky> but i think you're only running that code on page load, no?
[14:02:22] <shoky> don't get what you're doing
[14:02:29] <digs> Yeah, that is what I just noticed with the console. I need to attach it to someting.
[14:02:37] <shoky> on page load they will always be empty..
[14:02:40] <digs> Yeah.
[14:02:49] <shoky> you want to put that if INSIDE the blur handler
[14:02:52] <digs> I need to attach that to the timer or blur.
[14:02:54] <shoky> or something of that sort
[14:02:57] <digs> cool.
[14:03:00] <digs> Thanks shoky
[14:03:08] <shoky> np
[14:03:35] <shoky> keep a reference to the parent address block outside of the blur handler
[14:04:13] <shoky> so you wont have to do something like $(this).closest('div.address').find(....
[14:04:23] <shoky> for each input
[14:07:31] <digs> sweet... _finally_ thanks for the help shoky
[14:07:41] <digs> I am writing a bit over my head here.
[14:07:48] <fdv> Parhs: still here?
[14:09:04] <shoky> np digs, looks good
[14:10:46] <digs> thanks.

[14:17:43] <fatmandown> if I call .tabs() on just the content I want tabbed, can I bind a click function to external images to select the tabs?
[14:18:13] <shoky> fatmandown: yeeah
[14:18:43] <shoky> fatmandown: use the 'select' method
[14:21:32] <HorizonXP> i'm using getJSON to get JSON data from my server, and subsequently plotting it using flot
[14:21:53] <HorizonXP> how can I do a getJSON on 3 different URLs and pass them all to the plotting callback?
[14:21:58] <HorizonXP> can I chain them?
[14:23:32] <shoky> HorizonXP:  var req1 = $.getJSON('url1'), req2 = $.getJSON('url2'), req3 = $.getJSON('url3')]; $.when(req1,req2,req3).then(function(data1, data2, data3) { ..... });
[14:26:13] <shoky> oops without that ]
[14:29:57] <fatmandown> shoky, do I have to use list items?
[14:30:04] <HorizonXP> shoky: i'll try that, thanks1
[14:30:05] <fatmandown> for the tab navigation, I mean.
[14:30:48] <Sssnake> Hi everybody
[14:31:13] <Sssnake> I have a problem with a validation script and can't figure out why it won't work.
[14:31:17] <Sssnake> Anyone can help?
[14:40:59] <shoky> fatmandown: your html markup for the tabs should be just like the docs/examples say
[15:01:00] <Sssnake> I've got a form that I need to validate with a custom "method" not present in the basic jquery.validationEngine.js.
[15:01:09] <Sssnake> I tried to add it to the other-validations.js, but it won't work. I'm calling it with the function <input type="text" class="validate[required,custom[cfitaly]]" name="emailfatt" />
[15:01:19] <Sssnake> http://pastebin.com/qR2fxkJV
[15:01:27] <Sssnake> Where am I wrong?
[15:34:46] <Parhs> hello guys
[15:34:49] <Parhs> i have a strange problem
[15:35:06] <Parhs> $.each(data[0].media, function(i,media){  this sorts the list , i want it to keep original sort
[15:35:31] <shoky> data[0].media is an array?
[15:35:40] <shoky> or a map?
[15:36:23] <shoky> anyway $.each doesn't sory anything
[15:36:26] <shoky> sort
[15:36:38] <Parhs> i dont know whats going wrong there
[15:36:45] <Parhs> it is a map
[15:36:49] <Parhs> {key:val}
[15:36:54] <shoky> then there _is_ no sort order
[15:37:01] <shoky> maps aren't sorted
[15:37:41] <Parhs> http://pastebin.com/1cqp6JSe
[15:37:49] <Parhs> this is the response
[15:37:50] <Parhs> i get
[15:38:25] <Parhs> although 138 is first and then is 137
[15:38:34] <Parhs> .each shows 137 first:S
[15:38:42] <shoky> like i said, maps have no sort ordwer
[15:38:43] <shoky> order
[15:38:51] <Parhs> $.each(data[0].media, function(i,media){
[15:38:52] <Parhs>                                 fileList.append(
[15:38:58] <Parhs> so where is the problem ?
[15:39:09] <shoky> your expectations
[15:40:15] <Parhs> what do you mean ?
[15:40:25] <shoky> you're expecting it to be sorted. that is the problem
[15:40:39] <Parhs> i expect them to be in order server sent them
[15:40:51] <shoky> the server sends back a string
[15:40:56] <shoky> which you then parse as json
[15:40:59] <shoky> into a javascript map
[15:41:03] <shoky> which has no order
[15:41:19] <shoky> if you want to maintain order,
[15:41:34] <shoky> make your server send back an array, not a map
[15:41:58] <ravster> Hello everyone
[15:42:27] <shoky> Parhs:  e.g.  "media": [ {"id":138, "metadata":...}, {"id":137, "metadata":....}, ... ]
[15:43:02] <shoky> or, you can transform the map into an array client-side
[15:43:26] <shoky> well but then you lose the original order, so nevermind
[15:43:34] <ravster> Is there a way to ensure that an ajax .load() passes the data as an object by a GET request? The reference says that it will use POST if the data is in the form of an object.
[15:44:15] <Parhs> i got confused, i didnt expect that  behavior..
[15:44:17] <shoky> ravster: for full control use $.ajax
[15:44:24] <ravster> or should I just use a $.get() to make sure?
[15:44:37] <shoky> that'd work too
[15:44:52] <ravster> shoky: okay. I'll do that. Thanks.
[16:16:46] <HAPPYFUNBRO> is there a simple way to clone an element + it's children?
[16:28:00] <prefixed> Anyone in here have any ideas how I would get a "navbar player" to update it's progress bar with that of the progress of a single player ont he same page? JPLAYER http://www.jplayer.org/2.0.0/developer-guide/
[16:46:01] <bindi> http://pastebin.com/2xukCFSN I have this, how can I get the div's id (julkaisu_179) by clicking on the link?     $("a.click_comments").click(function(e) {e.preventDefault();LataaKommentit($(this).closest("div.julkaisu").attr("id"));});
[16:46:05] <bindi> doesn't work
[16:46:27] <bindi> says undefined.. works if I have <div> and then <a> right after that
[16:47:35] <shoky> bindi uhmm why do you have <tr><td> in a div?
[16:47:45] <bindi> shoky: just showing dataz
[16:47:50] <bindi> not important
[16:48:02] <shoky> that's not how html tables work but ok
[16:48:08] <bindi> i have a <table> before that
[16:48:12] <shoky> doesn't matter
[16:48:19] <bindi> how don't they work?
[16:48:23] <bindi> data shows up fine
[16:48:37] <shoky> cause you're lucky ;p
[16:49:06] <shoky> they work like <table><tr><td></td></tr>...</table>
[16:49:17] <shoky> with optional <tbody> around the rows
[16:49:32] <shoky> no divs under the table
[16:49:40] <shoky> only inside a cell, maybe
[16:50:26] <shoky> anyway $(this).closest("div.julkaisu")  is fine , so either that bad markup is causing the problem or you have another issue
[16:50:34] <bindi> yeah
[16:50:35] <bindi> it was that
[16:50:37] <bindi> had to move the table down :p
[16:50:40] <shoky> ;p
[17:06:44] <xenaxon> is there any online or offline tool to automatically optimize jquery/JS code
[17:11:11] <Haprog> xenaxon: Most javascript minifiers/compressors do optimizations. For example YUI Compressor, Closure Compiler etc.
[17:11:34] <Haprog> there are plenty
[17:11:45] <Haprog> both online and offline
[17:11:47] <xenaxon> I have my own custom jquery code written by me
[17:11:48] <xenaxon> it's not a plugin
[17:11:50] <xenaxon> just for a page
[17:12:13] <xenaxon> and I'm just a beginner, unfortunately a more advanced programmer said my code is "atrocious"
[17:12:37] <xenaxon> :)) and I was trying to optimize my code somehow. even manual, if I could find out how
[17:16:41] <xenaxon> Haprog: YUI Compressor gives me errors
[17:17:36] <sahbeewah> a compressor won't fix badly written code
[17:18:28] <sahbeewah> you're better investing some time to make it better

[17:35:24] <Parhs> any idea why getJson doesnt call the function when data is received ?
[17:35:27] <Parhs> in opera only
[17:35:28] <Parhs> ?
[17:46:51] <ravster> How do I see the element at the end of an array? I'm thinking of using a stack, but I'd like to also be able to peek at the element instead of popping it off.
[17:47:20] <ravster> or do i just use the .length function on the array?
[17:50:23] <Parhs> any idea why
[17:50:28] <Parhs> getJson
[17:50:32] <Parhs> doesnt work in opera/
[18:11:56] <imsky> so quiet in here
[18:12:06] <RandyW> Boo!

[18:28:39] <sk8ball> can anyone point me toward a good jquery plugin that does transitions from one link to an anchor (or other DOM element)
[18:29:20] <sk8ball> basically a smooth slide either vertically or possibly horizontal - hopefully it would hae multiple transition effects
[18:29:33] <sk8ball> i know there is a couple good ones out there
[18:29:41] <sk8ball> i just cant remember their names
[18:30:13] <sk8ball> parhs, why are you using opera?
[18:52:55] <prefixed> what is the best way to find all elements of a specific class on a page?
[18:59:16] <prefixed> does jquery have a method that will do an action every X milliseconds?
[18:59:58] <shoky> prefixed: setInterval/setTimeout
[19:01:02] <sk8ball> anybody ??? good pluginfor transitions between link and a target/anchor on the same page?
[19:03:25] <imsky> what
[19:05:40] <prefixed> $(document).find('a.jp-play') will find *all* a.jp-play elements on a page, right?
[19:05:44] <prefixed> shoky thanks
[19:05:58] <shoky> prefixed: just use $('a.jp-play')
[19:06:13] <shoky> but.. yes
[19:06:21] <prefixed> shoky I have this:
[19:06:22] <prefixed> $(document).find('a.jp-play').click(function() {
[19:06:31] <shoky> why not $('a.jp-play') ?
[19:06:42] <prefixed> would $('a.jp-play)... be functionally exact?
[19:06:53] <shoky> pretty much
[19:07:01] <prefixed> how would it be different?
[19:07:49] <shoky> it would find the same elements, would give you same result

[20:04:28] <KrizOne> hi guys, im trying to get the .val() of an input field that has been created after the page was loaded, any idea how i go about this?
[20:13:12] <sahbeewah> it doesn't matter when it was created, just use a selector to grab it $(selector).val()
[21:02:12] <Amanda1919> hi, any idea for nice modern industrial design website, i need some inspirations
[21:23:50] <dareign85> $("#d").children()[0].remove();
[21:24:04] <dareign85> why is this saying "Uncaught TypeError: Object #<HTMLTableElement> has no method 'remove' "
[21:24:21] <dareign85> how do i delete a table?
[21:31:12] <systemfault> jQuery works by wrapping DOM nodes within a jQuery object, when  do you [0], it unwraps the node
[21:31:43] <systemfault> And you get a pure DOM node.. You can avoid the wrapping by using .eq(0) instead of [0]
[21:31:49] <prefixed> This should change the text inside of the relevant DOM element to "HELLO", correct? $(navWrapper).find('navbar-player-play-time').val('Hello');
[21:31:57] <systemfault> s/wrapping/unwrapping
[21:32:21] <systemfault> prefixed: No, .val() only works for form elements
[21:32:39] <prefixed> systemfault then how do you change the text within a div?
[21:32:43] <systemfault> In your specific case, use .html("Hello");
[21:33:32] <Kriz1> hi guys, im trying to get the .val of a newly created form element but  it just returns an empty value, ive checked my name of the selector and they are the same :S does .val have any issues getting the value or newly created form elements?
[21:34:55] <systemfault> No,  there's no distinction between "normal" and newly created elements
[21:35:07] <Kriz1> ah ok then
[21:36:20] <Kriz1> any idea what could be wrong? :S
[21:38:07] <Kriz1> var linkTitle = $('#edit_title').val();
[21:38:10] <Kriz1> is that syntax ok?
[21:38:21] <systemfault> No
[21:38:27] <Kriz1> oh :S
[21:38:37] <systemfault> Wait..
[21:38:58] <systemfault> Is #edit_title a form element?
[21:39:09] <Kriz1> yep
[21:39:19] <systemfault> It should work then..
[21:39:33] <Kriz1> yeah thats what i thought XD
[21:39:46] <systemfault> If, of course, you have an element with a id of edit_title in the body

[22:18:30] <snuggs> I'm seeing this (alt 7) character in front of your name
[22:18:36] <snuggs> not anymore though
[22:18:38] <snuggs> i was
[22:18:45] <systemfault> snuggs: That was a /me
[22:18:50] * systemfault dances
[22:18:57] <systemfault> They're actions
[22:19:06] <snuggs> this is new to me!
[22:19:20] <snuggs> been a while
[22:19:47] <snuggs> so its like irc version of fb open graph
[22:19:53] <snuggs> gotcha
[22:20:47] <snuggs> do you guys use js.node?
[22:21:18] <snuggs> and if so does it handle everything php does?
[22:21:30] <systemfault> node.js? Only as a build tool for my backbone projects.
[22:21:47] <snuggs> I'm exploring it now
[22:22:06] <systemfault> snuggs: node.js is… different, you have an application scope, but yeah, in practice, you can do the same as with PHP
[22:22:11] <snuggs> i would love for my front-end dev to talk to my server better than hacks
[22:22:50] <systemfault> snuggs: Make nice RESTful services^
[22:22:59] <systemfault> -^
[22:23:03] <snuggs> sounds ridiculous but the main reason is that I deal a lot with Facebook and their api and constantly run into issues passing between php and js
[22:23:54] <snuggs> because their php api doesn't allow flexibility and options their js api does
[22:24:11] <snuggs> systemfault: you do?
[22:24:20] <systemfault> Yeah.. for work
[22:24:33] <snuggs> where do you work?
[22:24:45] <systemfault> It's a bit personal to be honest..
[22:24:58] <snuggs> oh gotcha. a porn site
[22:25:03] <snuggs> hahah jking
[22:25:09] <snuggs> unless....
[22:25:34] <systemfault> Haha
[22:25:45] <systemfault> I'd be richer if I worked on that
[22:25:54] <snuggs> depends which
[22:26:03] <snuggs> you could be a poor bastard too
[22:26:33] <snuggs> do you freelance?
[22:26:57] <systemfault> I did in the past… but I'm way too busy at the moment
[22:27:06] <snuggs> i hear ya
[22:28:39] <coldhead> porn site clients are very unpleasant
[22:28:39] <b-ot> coldhead, you have one new message, say “read” to me when you wish to read it.
[22:28:46] <coldhead> oh thanks b-ot
[22:31:04] <snuggs> systemfault I'm looking for freelancers for web-apps so if you know anyone
[22:31:17] <systemfault> Ok :P
[22:31:22] <systemfault> You also have too much work? :P
[22:31:34] <snuggs> you don't even know...
[22:32:35] <coldhead> snuggs: if you have a link with the details you can paste here from time to time you might get some results
[22:32:39] <snuggs> I started at a advertising agency now I'm heading the digital division, i own my own company, and i have everyone one and their brother berathing down my neck for something so yeah i'm a bit stacked myself
[22:32:41] <coldhead> i believe there's also #freelance
[22:33:11] <snuggs> coldhead: thanks
[22:33:22] <snuggs> its been a really long time since I've been on irc.
[22:33:47] <coldhead> lots of peeps in here looking for a little something
[22:33:52] <snuggs> Last time I was on here I was using filter downloads
[22:34:39] <snuggs> are their even still list downloads on irc?
[22:34:48] <snuggs> its like it not even necessary these days
[22:36:38] <coldhead> that's probably not a common occurence on freenode
[22:55:38] <krz> $.post('ajax/test.html', function(data) { is data a json object?
[22:56:12] <coldhead> depends what the server returns!
[22:56:26] <coldhead> probably not JSOn in this case, more likely a string of HTML
[22:57:03] <krz> ah
[22:57:06] <krz> actually its json
[22:57:20] <krz> so lets say i wanted to add to this json object, how do i go about that?
[22:57:38] <krz> pseudo code: data << {'foo' : 'bar'}
[22:58:14] <coldhead> if you can verify that the returned text validates with jsonlint.com, jQuery should convert it for you
[22:58:40] <krz> i know, but i want to add to the json object
[22:58:45] <coldhead> and if that works then data.foo = 'bar';
[22:59:18] <krz> but thats assuming foo exists
[22:59:24] <krz> what if foo does not exist
[22:59:28] <coldhead> like hell it is
[22:59:44] <krz> what?
[22:59:52] <coldhead> ?eval data = {}; data.foo = 'aids; data
[22:59:55] <bot-t> coldhead: SyntaxError: unterminated string literal
[22:59:59] <coldhead> oops
[23:00:12] <coldhead> ?eval data = {}; data.foo = 'aid'; data
[23:00:13] <bot-t> coldhead: {"foo": "aid"}
[23:00:18] <coldhead> sorry about that bot-t
[23:00:28] <coldhead> see krz, you can just add whatever you need
[23:00:42] <coldhead> javascript is like "oh man, no problemo! i'll just fang that key in there for you"
[23:01:26] <krz> ?eval data = {'foo':'bar'}; data.bar = 'bar'; data
[23:01:27] <bot-t> krz: {"foo": "bar", "bar": "bar"}
[23:01:43] <coldhead> :D
[23:01:49] <coldhead> great work everyone, take 5
[23:02:00] <krz> high five :-D
[23:11:29] <abjorn> :o
[23:34:12] <Xtrivity> Hey guys -- I am using the toggle function to expand a menu. What would be the best approach to track whether the menu is expanded or colapsed so that if a user reloads it will have that last settings. I was thinking of a database or sessions call but seems rather overkill i'm thinking
[23:41:38] <coldhead> Xtrivity: a cookie, or some form of HTML5 local storage
[23:41:59] <coldhead> that's the kind of thing cookies are designed for
[23:42:01] <coldhead> site preferences
