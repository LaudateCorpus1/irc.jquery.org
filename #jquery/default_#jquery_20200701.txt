[06:33:31] <Tam90> How to set iframe width and height
[07:30:44] <Cork> Tam90: depends on what you want to do
[16:28:02] <kwhat4> is it possible to do something like $('#myTable tr').css() and modify all selected elemnts?
[16:28:26] <robertmaxrees> yeah, that's how CSS works :)
[16:28:33] <robertmaxrees> most jquery methods do that, in fact.
[16:28:53] <kwhat4> hmm thats what i thought but its been a very long time, let me dig around some more
[16:29:03] <robertmaxrees> something not working as expected?
[16:29:27] <kwhat4> yah, i have the above but only the first one gets updated
[16:29:37] <robertmaxrees> first TR?
[16:29:46] <kwhat4> yup
[16:29:54] <robertmaxrees> are you dynamically adding the other trs?
[16:30:05] <kwhat4> ahh yah
[16:30:08] <robertmaxrees> that's why.
[16:30:21] <robertmaxrees> .css() only applies to elements that exist when you run it.
[16:30:40] <robertmaxrees> i'd use plain ol' css for what you're trying to do instead.
[16:31:03] <kwhat4> yah, I seem to remember that now.  What do you mean plane old css?  I just need to display: table-row
[16:31:24] <robertmaxrees> like, use normal CSS, instead of applying it via jquery.
[16:31:56] <kwhat4> ah i need to update it...
[16:32:04] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[16:32:10] <kwhat4> display none > table-row
[16:32:19] <robertmaxrees> yeah, you can do that with CSS just fine.
[16:32:24] <robertmaxrees> part of the whole "cascade" :)
[16:32:57] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/rjf6vy9c/
[16:33:46] <kwhat4> Im still not following how I can do that when a js function.
[16:33:57] <robertmaxrees> why does it need to be with JS?
[16:34:07] <robertmaxrees> ooooh, like you need to change it on the fly.
[16:34:11] <kwhat4> its processing some ui junk on click
[16:34:14] <robertmaxrees> then use lasses :)
[16:34:19] <robertmaxrees> *classes
[16:35:21] <robertmaxrees> sec.
[16:36:05] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/rjf6vy9c/2/
[16:38:06] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/rjf6vy9c/5/ which lets you do this.
[16:38:56] <kwhat4> ah i see, so classes can be toggled
[16:39:50] <robertmaxrees> yep.  and if you use css to target "through" a class, you can do stuff like this, which is much better than trying to apply styles using .css() on a piecemeal basis
[16:42:22] <robertparkerx> there is a element that I must set to aria-atomic=true. I tried $('.ui-helper-hidden-accessible').attr("aria-atomic", "true"); but no luck. I think the element is created dynamic. How could I approach it?
[16:42:33] <robertparkerx> I don't want to edit 1.9.2 ui and plugins
[16:43:03] <robertmaxrees> robertparkerx "i think the element is created dynamic" - get confirmation on that.
[16:43:08] <robertmaxrees> if it is, then we need to know how.
[16:43:59] <robertparkerx> I've been looking and I can't find it. It's coming from a plugin. I've narrowed it down to that but I still cannot find any of the class names or attributes in the code for the plugin.
[16:44:16] <robertmaxrees> what plugin?
[16:44:30] <robertparkerx> A WordPress plugin - search autocomplete
[16:44:49] <robertmaxrees> Hrm.
[16:44:55] <robertmaxrees> and it doesn't expose an API?
[16:45:02] <robertparkerx> no
[16:45:08] <robertmaxrees> bummer
[16:45:35] <robertmaxrees> if it's firing via ajax, you could try to come up with some kind of hook to the global ajax events potentially, though there's a good chance that won't work.
[16:45:41] <robertmaxrees> could also resort to DOMSubtreeModified.
[17:13:00] <robertparkerx> robertmaxrees my problem was the jquery ui and jquery ui autocomplete loaded with WordPress
[17:13:23] <robertparkerx> I had to dequeue scripts and queue the custom 1.9.2
[17:13:44] <robertmaxrees> "custom 1.9.2"??
[17:16:34] <robertparkerx> just had widget, autocomplete menu and some other options packaged
[17:16:41] <robertparkerx> I guess hat is considered custom
[17:17:10] <robertmaxrees> oh, so not a custom jquery build, just a bundled one.
[17:17:32] <robertmaxrees> rather, not like you edited the jquery source or anything haha.
[17:18:59] <kwhat4> eh this sucks
[17:19:07] <robertmaxrees> ?
[17:20:11] <kwhat4> I suddenly remember why I quit anything frontend when it comes to the web.  I cannot use your initial solution.
[17:20:27] <robertmaxrees> why not?
[17:22:01] <kwhat4> because its not suitable for my use case.  I have a tbody with lets say 100 tr, say 0-9 are #page_1 and 10-19 are #page_2 and and want to turn on #page_n via js.
[17:22:30] <robertmaxrees> ah, so you're trying to paginate them.
[17:23:06] <robertmaxrees> depending on the featureset you need, something like datatables might make more sense here.
[17:23:08] <kwhat4> basically, some junk front end pagination for this lagacy thing.  I can probably just store the data somewhere and render what i want each time.
[17:23:18] <robertmaxrees> or do that :)
[17:23:54] <robertmaxrees> an easier idea - a series of tables and flip through those, instead of one large one where you're trying to calculate each set of TRs.
[17:24:08] <kwhat4> hmm, not terrible idea.
[17:25:07] <kwhat4> im just going with the datastore, html/css are too autistic to get anything useful done.
[17:25:14] <robertmaxrees> or you can use multiple <tbody> elements.
[17:25:16] <robertmaxrees> hey woah
[17:25:21] <robertmaxrees> not an OK thing to say.
[17:25:42] <kwhat4> can you have more than 1 tbody?
[17:25:46] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[17:25:54] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/tbody#Usage_notes
[17:26:01] <robertmaxrees> "You may use more than one <tbody> per table as long as they are all consecutive."
[17:26:10] <robertmaxrees> there are some special considerations, but you totally can :)
[18:50:44] <robertparkerx> I can't seem to set style attribute by $('.wp-embedded-content').attr('style', 'height: 590px; width: 600px;');
[18:50:58] <robertmaxrees> use .css() instead
[18:58:56] <robertmaxrees> robertparkerx
[22:03:13] <gnstaxo> who knows a plugin to sort tables by fields?
[22:03:34] <robertmaxrees> google search shows a ton of options :)
[22:11:57] <gnstaxo> are you making fun of me?
[22:12:16] <robertmaxrees> Nope!  Not at all.  Just giving a suggestion.
[22:12:31] <gnstaxo> jk
[23:56:52] <rootboy_> test
[23:56:57] <robertmaxrees> tset
[23:57:02] <rootboy_> It works!
[23:57:47] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[23:58:02] <rootboy_> Hello guys, It's been a long time since I've been around here (d2k here). Today I would like to ask you for some help on a pretty tricky question: Looping HTML-5 audio seamlessly
[23:59:37] <robertmaxrees> Hrm
