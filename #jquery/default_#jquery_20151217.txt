[00:07:21] <Cork> claytonzaugg: sure
[00:07:38] <Cork> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/sort
[00:08:06] <Cork> claytonzaugg: note there are a lot of functions that are just plain javascript functions
[00:08:07] <claytonzaugg> thank you
[00:08:22] <Cork> jquery is mainly for accessing and modifying the dom
[00:08:33] <claytonzaugg> I'm trying to sort a JSON file but I'd like to sort by first_name though
[00:08:45] <Cork> claytonzaugg: you would have to parse the json first
[00:09:01] <Cork> if the server sends the content with the correct content-type it should happen automatically
[00:09:10] <Cork> and you would get an array/object instead
[00:09:46] <claytonzaugg> It's the "results" data of the .done() part of the AJAX request
[00:10:13] <claytonzaugg> I console logged results and it's an array of objects, which is fine, I just need to find and sort them all by first_name
[00:10:54] <Cork> claytonzaugg: so you have something like [{first_name:''},{}] ?
[00:11:17] <claytonzaugg> correct, amongst other things, but yes, first_name is in there
[00:12:50] <Cork> claytonzaugg: var response = data.sort(function(a,b) { if(a.first_name < b.first_name) { return 0 } else if(a.first_name > b.first_name) { return 1 } return 0; })
[00:12:58] <Cork> the basics of it is that
[00:13:15] <Cork> i never remember if a is less then b should be 1 or -1 :/
[00:13:18] <claytonzaugg> Okay great! Thank you Cork
[00:13:36] <Cork> if the array gets reverted switch 1 and -1
[00:14:23] <Vivekananda> hey everyone. if I have a function like this :  var x = function(){ } ; and I run x like : x(); Now I want to give x a callback function y ie x(y); how do I do this ?
[00:14:52] <Cork> Vivekananda: callbacks are just normal arguments
[00:15:41] <Vivekananda> Cork, in that case how do I define the var x to have an argument. I am a little unsure of the syntax hence asking
[00:15:56] <Cork> var x = function(callback) {};
[00:16:19] <Vivekananda> ok . Do I use the word 'callback' there or 'y' ?
[00:16:37] <Cork> you could call i y if you prefer
[00:16:50] <Cork> one letter variables is normally a bad idea though
[00:17:47] <Vivekananda> nope you didn't understand. ASSUMING my callback function is called 'y' what are the alphabets in need to type inside the function() as its arguments ?
[00:18:24] <Cork> no, your misunderstanding
[00:18:51] <Vivekananda> and that is ... ?
[00:19:00] <Cork> var x = function(callback) { callback(); }; x(function() {alert('hello'); });
[00:19:25] <Cork> callback functions is just a term for sending a function as reference
[00:19:35] <Cork> the functions aren't special in any way
[00:19:42] <Cork> or how you get access to them
[00:22:13] * Vivekananda thought Cork would make it simpler but :( 
[00:22:32] <Cork> Vivekananda: it doesn't get simpler that that >_>
[00:23:22] <Cork> Vivekananda: if it is a specific situation you have problem with, share the code and ask the specific question :)
[00:23:31] <Cork> hard to give a specific answer to a generic question
[00:23:32] <Vivekananda> Cork I didn't quite understand your second statement above esp why is there a 'function()' inside the x()? earlier it was simply x();
[00:23:51] <Cork> Vivekananda: that is just an inline function
[00:23:56] <Cork> you can split that up into
[00:24:12] <Vivekananda> so complicated then ? ( as compared to a simple x();) right ?
[00:24:23] <Cork> var x = function(callback) { callback(); }, y = function() { alert('hello'); }; x(y);
[00:24:33] <Vivekananda> yeah thanks . That works
[00:24:44] <Cork> Vivekananda: those two examples are the same
[00:24:57] <Cork> only difference is that one creates a local variable name y first
[00:25:09] <Vivekananda> got it. This second example you gave is what I was looking for
[00:25:18] <Cork> not sure why though
[00:25:31] <Cork> it just results in more code and longer living function
[00:25:31] <Vivekananda> Cork, another question
[00:26:00] <Vivekananda> how can I make sure that y is executed after everything inside x completes and page is loaded and ready ?
[00:26:05] <claytonzaugg> Cork, thank you so much! It worked :D
[00:26:17] <Cork> Vivekananda: by when you execute it
[00:26:29] <Cork> Vivekananda: again, callbacks is just normal code, nothing special/magical
[00:26:50] <Cork> claytonzaugg: nice
[00:27:09] <Vivekananda> Cork, hmm perhaps it doesn't solve my problem then. Let me ask the original question then
[00:27:59] <Vivekananda> my page has sections of code each needing their own .js file to work. so a small function called loadscript loads the correct file for the immediately following code. Now I am trying to make an ajax call to update all such code block elements. How do I do this ? Is there a way I can identify if all 'loadscripts' have run ? here is the loadscript function --  https://gist.github.com/vvikramjhu/ac0cf3f7530cb85caf94
[00:28:41] <Cork> Vivekananda: uh... sounds like you have structured your code badly
[00:28:59] <Cork> cause ya, that will be a pain to deal with
[00:29:20] <Cork> Vivekananda: you would have to chain everything inside $.loadScript(url).done(function() {})
[00:29:38] <Cork> and everything that depends on that script loaded there has to be inside the .done callback
[00:30:03] <Cork> Vivekananda: instead you should prob have put your code in functions instead of directly in the resources
[00:30:10] <Cork> so you could execute them again and again
[00:30:25] <Vivekananda> Cork, Actually not my code. It is a dashboard app I bought with lazy load built in. Demo here --  http://b6b668c0.ngrok.io/dashboard/SmartAdmin/DEVELOPER/AJAX_version/#ajax/dashboard.html
[00:31:34] <Vivekananda> so basically there is a pagesetup() function , a pagefunction() ( which takes care of page specific items) and a pagedestroy function()
[00:31:56] <Cork> so call them instead of reloading the resource
[00:33:57] <Vivekananda> Cork, so pagesetup() is just initially called. The imp function is pagefunction(). It has sections of code each preceded by its own loadscript(/xyz.js); now I tried calling my function inside pagefunction at the very end but it doesn't execute coz loadscript takes time and somehow asynchronous. so I have to figure out a way to call my own function after I am 100pc sure that pagefunction has finished ( with all loadscripts)
[00:49:36] <Vivekananda> Cork, any tips ?
[00:50:26] <Cork> Vivekananda: ya, you would have to wait for ALL the .done to fire for the loadScript calls
[00:51:26] <Cork> the base problem is that the pagesetup should have provided a callback for when the initialization is complete
[00:51:59] <Cork> Vivekananda: an alternative is to just statically load the scripts and just not call the pagesetup
[00:52:04] <Cork> prob the solution i would have used
[00:52:15] <Vivekananda> Cork, that isn't how the page is working at the moment. there are a couple of nested loadscriipts. All of them being called at different places but inside the pagefunction(). so I have to find a way that all loadscripts complete ie the pagefunction() itself completes and then call my ajax
[00:52:37] <Cork> Vivekananda: ya, but like i said there is no "when eveerything is loaded"
[00:52:43] <Vivekananda> hmm
[00:52:45] <Cork> the script have to actively check each request
[00:52:54] <Cork> and from your description this one doesn't
[00:53:02] <Cork> so ya...
[00:53:53] <Vivekananda> thought the pagefunction() function with the 'loadscript()' is good coz it doesn't delay the page loads. Also what you are asking for probably will have to change the whole code of the page. I am trying to avoid that and leverage the code in the interest of future upgrades of the dashboard from the publishers
[00:54:06] <Cork> Vivekananda: there are other ways you can do that
[00:54:14] <Cork> if you put them at the very end of the body
[00:54:19] <Cork> they won't block the page load
[00:54:24] <Cork> but still block the js execution
[00:54:48] <Cork> but this script is trying to be too fancy and ya...
[00:54:50] <Vivekananda> Cork, but both your solutions involve changing the whole page code structure ( and code )
[00:54:54] <Vivekananda> hmm
[00:55:29] <Cork> i have a big distaste for script blobs that is meant to load there dependencies by it self
[00:55:36] <Cork> they are always pains to extend
[00:56:10] <Vivekananda> Cork, the only alternative I have right now is to load multiple ajax functions ( each somewhat of a duplicate) but called from different parts of the page
[00:56:17] <Vivekananda> I was trying to avoid this but .. :(
[00:56:31] <Cork> Vivekananda: no, calling from a different part of the page won't help
[00:56:46] <Vivekananda> Calling what ?
[00:56:53] <Vivekananda> the ajax ?
[00:56:54] <Cork> you would put an arbitarray timeout and hope the loading has finished before it is called
[00:57:02] <Cork> would==could
[00:57:11] <Cork> but that is racy and a horrible idea
[00:57:35] <Cork> your only real option is to patch the loader to provide a callback for when the scripts has been loaded
[00:57:56] <Cork> if you still want it to load the dependencies internally
[00:58:03] <Cork> (i personally would rip that out so fast)
[00:59:59] <Vivekananda> Cork, no because if I call the ajax function like this then it works ( tested it ) --- https://jsfiddle.net/vvikramjhu/9c519axq/
[01:00:18] <Vivekananda> the only problem is that I will have to do this for each bunch of code that has a loadscript for it
[01:00:39] <Cork> Vivekananda: that is the callback i talked about before...
[01:00:50] <Cork> but not that means the loading will take a long time
[01:00:50] <Vivekananda> and so there will be multiple ajax calls.
[01:00:54] <Cork> *note
[01:00:59] <Vivekananda> hmmm
[01:01:13] <Cork> cause each resource won't be requested before the previous one have been fetched, parsed and executed
[01:01:35] <Cork> so you do an ~10x increasing in load time
[01:01:56] <Vivekananda> Cork, but why ? Each loadscript happens independently and each bunch of code can be delayed by its own loadscript but why will other parts of page stall ?
[01:02:00] <Cork> and that increase is relative to your ping time
[01:02:08] <Cork> Vivekananda: no
[01:02:12] <Cork> what happens is:
[01:02:28] <Cork> loadscript .cust.min.js
[01:02:35] <Cork> wait for the content to get back
[01:02:40] <Cork> parse the content
[01:02:43] <Cork> execute the content
[01:02:47] <Cork> fire done callback
[01:02:52] <Cork> loadscript resize.min.js
[01:02:58] <Cork> wait for content to come back
[01:02:59] <Cork> and so on
[01:03:17] <Cork> instead of request cust.min, resize.min time.min tooltip.min
[01:03:25] <Cork> parse content
[01:03:33] <Cork> execute each script in order
[01:03:48] <Cork> you get a MUCH bigger network time spent here
[01:03:53] <Vivekananda> Cork, but that is not happening. I understand what you are saying. I tried to do that but currently ( take a quick look at code if you want) but the line "hello world" is printed after the like "how are you doing" in here ---  https://jsfiddle.net/vvikramjhu/9c519axq/1/
[01:04:00] <Cork> Vivekananda: it is
[01:04:12] <Cork> you most likley sit close enough to the server not to notice the effect
[01:04:37] <Cork> but add say 100ms delay to the network traffic and it will be very noticeable
[01:04:38] <Vivekananda> Cork, ready my experiment results
[01:04:48] <Vivekananda> s/ready/read/
[01:04:57] <Cork> Vivekananda: i don't need to
[01:05:03] <Cork> it has to work that way
[01:05:10] <Vivekananda> umm but it doesn't
[01:05:15] <Cork> there are no other way to do it with the syntax you've used
[01:05:21] <Cork> like i said, it has to
[01:05:44] <Vivekananda> ok then let me put two console outputs and you can explain my results
[01:13:50] <Vivekananda> Cork, if you look aat console output on this page http://b6b668c0.ngrok.io/dashboard/SmartAdmin/DEVELOPER/AJAX_version/#ajax/dashboard.html   . you will see that code from 1510 is running AFTER 1834  (  https://gist.github.com/vvikramjhu/1d24dc4b3292be3604be )
[01:14:13] <Vivekananda> should have run before if code was getting stalled
[01:40:26] <Vivekananda> Cork, ^^
[01:45:29] <raz_> i have page1.php ; inside a div i am refreshing page2.php which represents a table created by php ; how can i access page2.php table selectors from page1.php
[01:47:17] <raz_> in other words, lets say in page2.php i have <table id="mytable"> ; from page1.php $("#mytable") doesnt seem to work
[01:50:04] <Uhkis> raz_: not enough info to answer
[01:52:06] <arc_> raz_ it sounds like your problem is that the element you are trying to select did not exist on page load. if that's the case, that means you should use a delegated event handler to select it
[01:52:33] <arc_> sorry, that made no sense at all. my brain is fried
[01:52:53] <arc_> i should stop trying to answer questions at 2am
[01:53:13] <arc_> but yeah, it depends on when you are selecting it
[01:53:43] <arc_> and when the element is created
[01:54:49] <raz_> page1.php: <div id="tableLocation"> </div> <script> $('#tableLocation').load('page2.php'); </script> <script> $("#myTable").on("click", function() { do something; }</script>
[01:55:18] <raz_> page2.php: <table id="myTable"></table>
[01:55:21] <raz_> does that make sense ?
[01:56:21] <Uhkis> yes
[01:56:35] <raz_> ok well apparently it doesnt work :P
[01:56:49] <Uhkis> you need $('#tableLocation').on('click' '#myTable', function() { .. });
[01:57:39] <raz_> hmm i will try thanks
[01:57:56] <arc_> lol. i guess my answer was accidentally right
[02:16:23] <raz_> its not working :(
[02:20:06] <raz_> http://pastebin.com/NM1qGB9g
[02:31:43] <arc_> raz_ you are missing a comma
[02:31:46] <arc_> on line 18
[02:32:16] <arc_> unfortunately i guess that same mistake was made in the example you were following
[02:32:28] <arc_> it's .on('click', '#myTable', etc
[02:35:29] <raz_> aah i was looking funny at that thanks
[02:37:02] <raz_> but thats not it
[02:37:04] <raz_> lol
[02:38:39] <arc_> well, what does your console say
[02:42:51] <raz_> Unexpected string at that .on('click' line .. and also GET http://ajax.aspnetcdn.com/ajax/jQuery/jquery.min.map 404 (Not Found)
[02:43:29] <raz_> im gona do a search on google brb
[02:46:49] <raz_> ooh nevermind!
[02:47:25] <raz_> you were right ! i uploaded the wrong file it works thank you!
[02:47:46] <raz_> javascript is badass :)
[02:54:03] <arc_> you're welcome
[03:21:13] <stivo_> hello there, what am i doing wrong that the 2nd selector isnt working as "expected"? http://jsbin.com/gilehocifa/1/edit?html,js,output
[03:27:38] <Kartagis> stivo_: you can't .append() to document.body.innerHTML
[03:27:49] <Kartagis> you append to the body
[03:32:57] <stivo_> Kartagis: sorry wrong paste, http://jsbin.com/xolejebako/1/edit?html,js,output
[04:04:37] <PokerGod> the X you see in search fields, is that default now or something?
[04:04:43] <PokerGod> to cancel the input
[04:07:56] <arc_> i am 99% sure it is not, unless you are talking about mobile
[04:08:16] <arc_> i mean.. all you have to do to test it is go to jsfiddle and create an input field
[04:08:30] <PokerGod> i see it in this fiddle; http://jsfiddle.net/marciosouzajunior/71yukww8/2/
[04:08:46] <PokerGod> i wondered how it came about, as i'm using data tables as well and mine doesn't do that
[04:08:47] <arc_> i don't. what browser
[04:08:56] <arc_> oh wait yeah it appears when i input something
[04:09:13] <arc_> yeah i'm guessing that has to do with datatables
[04:09:36] <arc_> it does not appear on a regular input
[04:17:01] <Kartagis> I'm guessing that's elem::after {content:"X";}
[04:17:13] <Kartagis> arc_, PokerGod ^
[04:17:56] <PokerGod> oh nice, will google that

[06:56:27] <Cork> eynix: create a struct?
[06:56:35] <Cork> what exactly do you mean?
[06:56:48] <Cork> you mean so you can chain functions?
[06:56:52] <Cork> or?
[06:57:06] <SrinivasGowda> can someone help me with select2 jquery validation
[06:57:06] <eynix> Cork: let's say, i'm creating new div containing images, I do it one by one
[06:57:17] <SrinivasGowda> its ignoring jquey validation]
[06:57:18] <eynix> Cork: I want to store my items in a struct
[06:57:36] <Cork> eynix: wrong language, there are no structs in js
[06:57:49] <eynix> -struct + object, don't play on words :(

[07:15:33] <eynix> another question: I try to do an image gallery. I have a clear feature that remove every images. But when I do so, the scrollbar  position isn't  recompute right away and this cause problems with the loading of new images. I workaround the problem by forcing the image loading regardless of the scrollbar position, but isn't it a better way to do ?
[07:16:22] <eynix> like forcing the scrollbar update or something
[07:16:24] <Cork> eynix: the browser is frozen while the javascript runs
[07:16:33] <Cork> that is prob what your seeing
[07:17:18] <Poluxor> Cork can u help me, please?
[07:17:39] <Cork> Poluxor: don't have an answer
[07:17:50] <Cork> and i'm tight on time so can't dig it up either
[07:27:23] <FilipNortic> how is it with return false in event handlers does it still stop all bubbeling?

[09:30:12] <Cork> ndury: test is an id not an element tag
[09:34:25] <jmdrawneek> Anyone use a javascript code sniffer?
[09:35:42] <Cork> jmdrawneek: to sniff what?
[09:39:14] <jmdrawneek> Cork: For coding standards or general information
[09:39:27] <Cork> huh?
[09:39:34] <Cork> to sniff standards??
[09:39:39] <jmdrawneek> Cork: I've got a great one for php and just wondered if there's anything for javascript
[09:39:49] <jmdrawneek> Cork: Sniff my code
[09:39:57] <Cork> sniff for what??
[09:40:04] <Cork> are you asking for a validator?
[09:40:30] <Cork>  http://www.jslint.com/ ?
[09:40:32] <jmdrawneek> Code sniffer are more than that. Your code can be valid but terrible.
[09:40:35] <Cork> is this what your asking for?
[09:40:42] <Cork> ya, that isn't a sniffer...
[09:40:48] <Cork> that's a validator/linter
[09:41:36] <Cork> http://jshint.com/ is an alternative
[09:42:21] <Cork> jmdrawneek: sniffer is to trying to identify something based on its content
[09:42:28] <ndury> Why am I not getting unique value's on the variables? https://jsfiddle.net/rr9s5cy4/
[09:42:38] <Cork> like sniffing a character stream to see if it is html or not
[09:42:39] <ndury> I'm new to web developement so cut me some slack pls, the # made me feel stupid enough.
[09:43:12] <jmdrawneek> Cork: So it checks for improvements and if functions etc are used incorrectly or more efficient alternatives are available
[09:45:37] <jmdrawneek> Cork: Must be terminology used for various things. This is what I use for php https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer
[09:45:43] <Cork> jmdrawneek: those two checks for code best practises
[09:46:05] <Cork> jmdrawneek: google have a javascript compiler that looks for dead code (not just patterns)
[09:46:27] <Cork> jmdrawneek: https://developers.google.com/closure/compiler/docs/compilation_levels?hl=en
[09:46:45] <jmdrawneek> Cork: Oh that sounds good.
[09:46:46] <Cork> jmdrawneek: about the php page, that is one really horribly bad named project
[09:51:00] <eynix> Cork: nice tools ! I wonder if it comes as lib you can includes in your code
[09:51:28] <Cork> eynix: if you include it in the code it would mean each visitor would have to download and execute it
[09:51:34] <Cork> so no, that would be a horrible idea
[09:51:51] <eynix> I mean while developping, not in production
[09:51:53] <jmdrawneek> Cork: Hmm that's a complier so not really what I'm looking for. Thanks though
[09:52:26] <Cork> jmdrawneek: if you want something to analyze the code and look for inefficiency it has to understand the code
[09:52:29] <Cork> meaning a compiler
[09:53:26] <eynix> !!
[09:53:30] <Cork> you can't find inefficient code in a dynamic language through static analyzes
[09:53:40] <jmdrawneek> Cork: Hmm I wonder if phpStorm has a plugin that runs that
[09:54:19] <eynix> var params = { 'foo': 'bar'}; params.foo <-- is this valid ?
[09:54:27] <Cork> yes
[09:54:33] <eynix> :O
[09:54:56] <Cork> it isn't just valid, it is common
[09:55:28] <eynix> I started js a week ago, I did params['foo'] the all time
[09:55:49] <Cork> eynix: params['foo'] is the same thing as params.foo
[09:55:58] <eynix> my code is gonna look a lot prettier :D
[09:56:01] <Cork> though var key = 'foo'; params.key isn't
[09:56:06] <Cork> while params[key] is
[09:56:28] <eynix> okay, good to know
[09:56:52] <Cork> also space and comma and dot and so on isn't allowed in the key if you want to access it through .
[09:57:15] <Cork> var params = { 'foo-baz': 'bar'}; params.foo-baz invalid
[09:57:27] <Cork> var params = { 'foo-baz': 'bar'}; params['foo-baz'] valid
[09:57:30] <eynix> but it is handled ? I mean
[09:57:34] <eynix> ok you alreaady respond
[09:57:35] <eynix> thanks
[09:58:42] <eynix> I was ready to start looking for a code review, but those website did some of the work
[09:58:53] <eynix> really nice
[10:06:44] <rfr> Can anyone give me an idea as to what I might be doing wrong here http://pastebin.com/UdsJ4zFA My conditionals work but the js call that are supposed to open the modals do not work. That is the modals never get upened. Thanks
[10:09:05] <eynix> "Unexpected 'for'."
[10:09:19] <eynix> wtf
[10:09:55] <rfr> eynix: Are you talking to me?
[10:10:15] <eynix> rfr: sorry no, I'm talking alone
[10:32:00] <jmdrawneek> When targeting an element that doesn't have a something unique to use as a selector, what is the best way to target it? ie jQuery('#id fieldset').length; or jQuery('#id).find(fieldset').length; or ?
[10:33:21] <jmdrawneek> Ugh ignore that first sporadic 'a'
[10:33:30] <hellyeah> can you check line 62-67 i built json string. But is there an easy way for doing this? https://jsfiddle.net/qLokkyfx/36/
[10:37:22] <eynix> jmdrawneek: this is the exact same thing to me
[10:38:38] <eynix> jmdrawneek: you can see it with console.log($('.foo .bar')) and console.log($('.foo').find('.bar)), the result is exactly the same
[10:38:59] <jmdrawneek> eynix: Performance difference?
[10:39:34] <eynix> jmdrawneek: I'm new to js/jquery but since the result is the same, I guess the $('') syntax use the find() func
[10:39:45] <eynix> so the same performance
[10:39:52] <eynix> you might test it though
[10:42:13] <jmdrawneek> eynix: Coding standards I've been looking at also states it's inefficient to use groups of selectors
[10:43:38] <eynix> jmdrawneek: if you want to be sure, you could like do a loop for a big number of times for each syntax and mesure the time
[10:43:58] <eynix> for with* a big number of iteration
[10:44:46] <rfr_> rfr:  OtherAmt = document.getElementById('OtherAmount'); if (OtherAmt.value.length !== 0) { //do something } This statement evaluates to true even if input tag is empty. Anyone know how I can make it only evaluate to true if there is value?
[10:49:58] <eynix> jmdrawneek: if you find a final answer to your question, i'm interrested btw
[10:59:53] <C0nundrum> Anyone know what i'm doing wrong here ? https://jsfiddle.net/dragonpiper/6kb8ky46/6/
[11:13:29] <BillCriswell> C0nundrum: Right channel?
[11:40:07] <rfr_> Hi, When I do OtherAmt = document.getElementById("OtherAmount");  alert(OtherAmt); The alert says [objectHTMLInputElement] instead of giving the value of the numberic input tag. Can anyone help?
[11:40:45] <eddief> thats what its supposed to do
[11:41:07] <eddief> try alert(OtherAmt.value)
[11:41:41] <MajorTennis> Hey I have a click event but the user wants to be able to hit the enter key when the li is highlighted
[11:41:55] <taplar> lol
[11:42:00] <MajorTennis> is there something i could replace "click" with to make it work
[11:42:09] <MajorTennis> or would i have to detect a certain keypress or ?
[11:42:37] <taplar> you'd need keypress/down/up, something.  and then be able to detect that they were over the li
[11:43:36] <taplar> maybe check if the li has focus, but i'm not sure non-inputs get focus
[11:43:54] <MajorTennis> its a li autogenerated from the jquery-ui autocomplete
[11:44:07] <MajorTennis> i think it might have focus because it highlights on hove
[11:44:09] <MajorTennis> r
[11:44:32] <taplar> oh, sure, you can do that.  autocomplete should already handle for enter pressing
[11:46:26] <MajorTennis> jquery always got my back
[11:46:35] <MajorTennis> and you taplar gg taplar
[11:47:45] <taplar> http://api.jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#event-select
[11:48:03] <taplar> that should fire i believe if they click one of the suggestions for arrow down and hit enter
[11:48:31] <rfr_> eddief: Thanks for the help. So I understand, to get the value of a var one must do var.value ?
[11:48:48] <taplar> rfr_:from a dom input node
[11:49:03] <taplar> .value will get you the value=""
[11:49:05] <eddief> otheramt is an object, value is a property of it....
[11:50:28] <rfr_> what if I say x = 3. Do I need to do if (x.value > 2) { // do something } ?
[11:50:34] <taplar> no
[11:50:41] <taplar> x is a simple variable in that case
[11:51:29] <taplar> a dom element is an object with properties relating to it, ranging from possibly the value, to width and height, to it's parent element and so on and so forth
[11:51:51] <rfr_> Confused as to why OtherAmt does not become a simple variable when I assign it with: OtherAmt = document.getElementById("OtherAmount");?
[11:52:05] <taplar> because getElementById returns a dom element
[11:52:09] <taplar> not a simple value
[11:52:32] <taplar> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/getElementById
[11:52:53] <rfr_> If I do OtherAmt = document.getElementById("OtherAmount"); OA = OtherAmt.value; Is OA now a simple variable?
[11:53:01] <taplar> yep
[11:53:12] <taplar> because value is not an object
[11:53:25] <rfr_> Okay, thanks. One more question. What does DOM stand for?
[11:53:32] <taplar> Document Object Model
[11:54:19] <rfr_> Ahh... Thank all you very much for the help.
[12:22:10] <oompahlumpa> Hey guys, I am having a problem with my jquery was wondering if someone could help me out
[12:22:25] <robertmaxrees> if you have a question, just ask.
[12:22:30] <robertmaxrees> if somebody can help, they will.
[12:22:46] <oompahlumpa> Ok so I have this code and it works find if you click and toggle through the different options
[12:22:56] <oompahlumpa> but if you double click it doesnt remove the class like it should
[12:22:59] <oompahlumpa> $('.top10_video').fadeOut(500, function() { 		var htm = '<iframe width="1110" height="625" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/' + whichVideo + '?wmode=transparent&rel=0&theme=dark&color=white&autoplay=1&showinfo=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>' 		$('.top10_video').html(htm); 		$('.top10_Title').html(noonerTitles[whichNumber]); 		$('.top10_Desc').html(noonerDesc[whichNumber]); 		$(".top10_video").fitVids(); 		/*$('html,body'
[12:23:05] <robertmaxrees> woah.
[12:23:08] <robertmaxrees> don't paste code in the channel.
[12:23:14] <robertmaxrees> make a fiddle or use bpaste or something like that instead.
[12:23:15] <oompahlumpa> OMG im sorry
[12:23:23] <oompahlumpa> im so sorry robert
[12:23:27] <oompahlumpa> let me fiddle
[12:23:29] <robertmaxrees> it's fine duder.
[12:23:30] <robertmaxrees> :)
[12:23:50] <oompahlumpa> https://jsfiddle.net/tfh2us4k/
[12:24:22] <robertmaxrees> so what's this about double-clicking?
[12:24:23] <oompahlumpa> See anything in there that would make it that when you double click it wouldn't remove the class active?
[12:24:32] <robertmaxrees> and why are you binding event listenwers inside that fadeout?
[12:24:49] <oompahlumpa> I am basically have  a bunch of links and when I click one it adds class and removes it from other
[12:25:06] <robertmaxrees> $(".top10_videolist .active").click(function(event){ shouldn't be in here.
[12:25:11] <robertmaxrees> that should be outside of this.
[12:25:18] <robertmaxrees> also, any console errors?
[12:27:38] <oompahlumpa> no console errors
[12:27:41] <oompahlumpa> checked that first
[12:27:55] <robertmaxrees> can you show me a broken example then?
[12:29:14] <oompahlumpa> I wish I could.. but it's on a private server in which you can only see locally :-\
[12:29:20] <robertmaxrees> an example.
[12:29:25] <robertmaxrees> like, make a functioning fiddle.
[12:29:35] <oompahlumpa> ok let me see what I can do
[12:29:56] <robertmaxrees> and take that click event binding out of there btw.
[12:30:48] <MajorTennis> thanks again taplar the autocomplete documentation you linked got me over the final hurdle all working nicely
[12:31:34] <MajorTennis> peace out \o[
[12:40:27] <surial> I have something like: <div><span class="foo"></span></div> <div><span class="foo"></div>. I have a jquery var which points at the first span. How do I find the second one? It's not .next(), as the next one is in a different div. I want the next element with class .foo, 'in order of DOM elements', if that makes sense.
[12:40:44] <surial> Is there such a thing or do I have to look for it, if that fails, go up a level, go back down levels, yadayada?
[12:40:53] <robertmaxrees> DOM traversal.
[12:40:58] <robertmaxrees> need to go up, next, and down.
[12:41:09] <surial> oof.
[12:41:14] <surial> because I might have to go up, up, up.
[12:41:26] <robertmaxrees> sounds liek you need to modify your markup/bindings then.
[12:41:32] <surial> nono.
[12:41:43] <surial> This model makes perfect sense.
[12:41:49] <robertmaxrees> lol 'kay.
[12:42:07] <surial> I have some facts about the exact structure but it sounds like a bad idea to now encode into the js that things break if I introduce a slight changel ater.
[12:42:28] <surial> It's a few tables with tabular data, split into sections; I want to navigate from row to row, even across tables, if you press the down key (think gmail).
[12:42:45] <taplar> cool
[12:42:49] <robertmaxrees> right, sounds like maybe you're doing things a little awkwardly.
[12:43:01] <surial> I can go hunt for the next section and then .find(".markableRow:first") in that one but some sort of .nextRegardlessOfLevels() if it had existed, would have been nicer.
[12:43:10] <surial> robertmaxrees: well, if there is a less awkward way to do it, I'm all ears.
[12:43:26] <robertmaxrees> surial make a basic fiddle and show me the idea of what you're doing :)
[12:44:03] <surial> one sec.
[12:44:15] <robertmaxrees> sounds like you're applying classes to the wrong things :)
[12:44:44] <surial> Hmm, I'd have to anonmize a lot, it's patient data.
[12:44:54] <surial> robertmaxrees: what makes you draw that conclusion?
[12:44:56] <robertmaxrees> HIPPA, sure.  but i don't want the actualy page.
[12:44:59] <robertmaxrees> *actual
[12:45:04] <robertmaxrees> i want an example.
[12:45:09] <surial> I understand, but showing you the intricacies of this is complicated.
[12:45:11] <robertmaxrees> and i certainly don't want your data.
[12:45:12] <surial> I gave you one.
[12:45:20] <surial> I have something like: <div><span class="foo"></span></div> <div><span class="foo"></div>. I have a jquery var which points at the first span. How do I find the second one? It's not .next(), as the next one is in a different div. I want the next element with class .foo, 'in order of DOM elements', if that makes sense. <-- just this really.
[12:45:45] <surial> Maybe one of them is something like <div><div><span class="foo"></span></div><span class="foo"></span></div><span class="foo"></span><div><span class="foo"></span></div>.
[12:45:49] <surial> It's not quite that weird but lets say it is.
[12:45:53] <surial> I just want to hop from foo to foo to foo.
[12:46:06] <robertmaxrees> ... okay i'll play the copy paste game for you.
[12:46:52] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/y6r8mzw8/
[12:46:59] <robertmaxrees> so it looks like you have a list of things?
[12:47:02] <surial> I can of course do $(".foo").each or whatnot, but let's say that a user uses the mouse to click one of these, how do I now travel the cursor there. Ooh, is that a thing I can do? Given "LIST", a jquery element with 100 elements in it, and "TARGET", a jquery element with 1 element in it, can I fetch whatever element immediately follows "TARGET" in "LIST"?
[12:48:00] <robertmaxrees> slow down.
[12:48:00] <robertmaxrees> given the fiddle i just sent, what are you trying toa ccomplish?
[12:48:40] <surial> highlighting the span.foo elements across the entire page, hopping to the next or previous span.foo on keydowns.
[12:48:55] <surial> also, for the 'active' (highlighted) span.foo to move to whatever you click with the mouse, and then keydowns will navgiate from there.
[12:49:22] <robertmaxrees> okay, so ignoring the mouse thing (because that's the easiest), there's a semi-simple way to get your first one.
[12:49:24] <surial> Does that make sense?
[12:49:35] <robertmaxrees> when you apply the active class, are you applying it to the span?
[12:49:41] <surial> yes.
[12:49:43] <taplar> seems like a menu thing jqueryui would already have a widget for
[12:49:47] <robertmaxrees> that's half of your issue.
[12:49:51] <surial> taplar: it's not.
[12:50:11] <robertmaxrees> you should be appling that class to the parent elements of those spans.
[12:50:18] <robertmaxrees> then use CSS to do whatever styling you want.
[12:50:30] <surial> taplar: think gmail's normal main page. you can keyboard nav your way around the mail. Now imagine gmail lists multiple email boxes on one page, in their own little containers on that page, and you want down on the last mail on mailacct1 to move the 'cursor' to the first one of mailacct2.
[12:50:40] <surial> robertmaxrees: .. but one div can have multiple spans.
[12:50:45] <robertmaxrees> that's fine.
[12:50:55] <surial> I can introduce an arbitrary meaningless parent if you like. Not sure how that helps, but if it does, not a problem.
[12:51:04] <robertmaxrees> unless you're saying that you can highlight each individual span.
[12:51:35] <surial> the normal flow is: <div class="mailaccount">5 such 'spans' that can be highlighted one at a time... </div><div class="anotehrAcct">more spans here</div>, but I'd be happier if it still works even if, say, anotherAcct has a fieldset around it or who knows what.
[12:51:41] <surial> robertmaxrees: you can highlight each individual span, yes.
[12:51:53] <robertmaxrees> okay.  that's really relevant.  so your example was incomplete.
[12:52:08] <surial> (It's also not a span, but a table row or div or something else not display: inline, but that's as far as jquery nav goes irrelevant).
[12:52:18] <robertmaxrees> the element is irrelevant.
[12:52:27] <surial> yeah, I see how trying to explain the underlying UI notion means that <span> was a poor choice here. Moving on.
[12:52:47] <robertmaxrees> span wasn't a poor choice - an incomplete example for the markup was ;)
[12:52:53] <robertmaxrees> that's why i was asking for an example earlier.
[12:53:21] <surial> https://jsfiddle.net/y6r8mzw8/1/
[12:53:45] <surial> I just added some spans. The aim is for spans to be highlightable, and the highlight travels on keydown (up or down), but it also travels if you click on a 'foo'.
[12:54:52] <surial> If I can (A) given for exmaple $("span.foo:first"), how can I traverse to the next span.foo in the document regardless of nesting, _OR_ (B) Given for example $("span.foo") and $("span.foo:first"), how can I navigate to the element in the first jquerysel object that follows whatever the second jquerysel object points at, preferably in O(1) time, I'm good.
[12:55:30] <surial> My hacky crap solution is to give each span.foo an id="foo_1", "foo_2", etc, then on click simply extract that number, and go with that.
[12:55:37] <robertmaxrees> lol using big o notation is totally irrelevant.
[12:55:48] <robertmaxrees> and don't use IDs like that - just use indices.
[12:55:49] <surial> robertmaxrees: of course it is.
[12:55:51] <cdwSymfony> So got a teaser for you.  I am trying to insert an HR tag ahead of a a block of code.  the hr tag is specified like this $('<hr/>') But the content in the append is being wrapped in the HR.  Is there a better way to do this?
[12:55:53] <surial> There are about 2000 elements on this page.
[12:56:06] <cdwSymfony> *code = html.
[12:56:08] <surial> If the keyboard down nav requires scanning from the top through all 2000, well, on various versions of IE you're gonna notice, I'm pretty sure.
[12:56:17] <robertmaxrees> surial that should have almost no bearing on performance of this particular handler.
[12:56:22] <taplar> cdwSymfony:try insertBefore()
[12:56:23] <surial> okay, well, I guess I can do that too.
[12:56:24] <robertmaxrees> and i never said you need to scan everything.
[12:56:28] <surial> Feels even ickier than the foo_2 solution.
[12:56:39] <robertmaxrees> you're really not interested in listening ;)
[12:56:40] <robertmaxrees> good luck.
[12:56:43] <surial> it's what I meant (avoiding loops on every keydown), when I said 'preferably O(1)'.
[12:56:47] <surial> robertmaxrees: WTF?
[12:56:56] <taplar> append() and prepend() insert into the element.  insertBefore() and insertAfter() put the element in the relevant position outside the element
[12:57:10] <cdwSymfony> @taplar would that be $('<hr/>').insertBefore($content)?
[12:57:22] <taplar> that would put the hr immediately before that content element
[12:57:25] <surial> robertmaxrees: Which thing you said did I not answer / listen to?
[12:57:28] <surial> robertmaxrees: I have no idea why you said that.
[12:57:49] <surial> robertmaxrees: 'just use indices'. Swell. I'd love to. How?
[12:57:50] <robertmaxrees> surial you're just getting way ahead of yourself and working through it.  not a big deal duder :)  good luck.
[12:58:18] <surial> robertmaxrees: given that $("span.foo") gives me a jquerysel with 500 elements in it. Given: I click on some specific span.foo in there. How do I determine the index in my jquerysel object?
[12:58:20] <surial> just loop it?
[12:58:32] <robertmaxrees> no need to loop.
[12:58:32] <surial> or is there some sort of $("span.foo").findIndexOf($(evt.target));?
[12:58:34] <robertmaxrees> there's a .index()
[12:58:41] <surial> that'll do nicely then.
[12:58:42] <surial> Thanks!
[12:59:03] <robertmaxrees> which is the index relevant to the current set of siblings.
[12:59:24] <robertmaxrees> if that element happens to be last, then you'll traverse up and down the tree to get to the next span.
[12:59:31] <huck5> Hey. I have a page with a section setup like this https://jsfiddle.net/9vk6L8ff/5/ . Is there a way to select the <span> element, based on its adjacency to the <a id="addObTrig"> ?
[12:59:46] <robertmaxrees> no need for eveng target with the keyboard naviagtion.
[13:00:13] <taplar> huck5:try $('#addObTrig').prev()
[13:00:20] <huck5> thanks taplar
[13:00:21] <robertmaxrees> huck5 can you wrap a parent element around these?
[13:00:42] <cdwSymfony> taplar: Here is the code, I think I am missing something just can't put my finger on what it is. http://pastie.org/private/hpshvjjyvlyrapftakapyq
[13:02:17] <taplar> cdwSymfony:got a fiddle showing the issue?
[13:02:54] <huck5> robertmaxrees, unfortunately not. I can not change the way the page is laid-out, only work with what is there.
[13:03:10] <robertmaxrees> huck5 bummer.
[13:03:18] <huck5> I can target the <span> by it's `data-i18n` attribute. I was just hoping for a way to do it based on it's adjacency to the anchor tag. Not a big deal :).
[13:03:57] <robertmaxrees> eh, i only ask because being able to use .closest() and .find() can make things like this much less fragile.
[14:04:49] <TheJeff> hey #jquery
[14:04:58] <TheJeff> noob, not a programmer, just need a quick tip
[14:05:11] <robertmaxrees> kay
[14:05:13] <TheJeff> whatever tool is easiest (i dont have a development environment but can install things)
[14:05:24] <TheJeff> and did google. a lot.
[14:05:31] <robertmaxrees> "whatever tool is easier" for...?
[14:05:39] <TheJeff> looking to find like... keys associated with a value in a json
[14:05:49] <TheJeff> so i've got these massive jsons, thousands of lines
[14:06:01] <TheJeff> and i need to find the nested keys for certain values
[14:06:12] <TheJeff> (to refer to with chef tbh)
[14:06:23] <robertmaxrees> can you make a basic example of what you've got?
[14:06:31] <TheJeff> sure
[14:06:32] <robertmaxrees> not the whole thing, just a basic example?
[14:07:20] <robertmaxrees> pop it into https://jsfiddle.net/ and we can help you out.
[14:07:51] <TheJeff> http://pastebin.com/bHNgG1Q4
[14:08:02] <TheJeff> so - in my case, say I know 'blueberry'
[14:08:12] <TheJeff> and I want to find the keys.leading.to.that.value
[14:08:18] <robertmaxrees> why?
[14:08:40] <TheJeff> because it's a chef node (this is a devops thing) and I know the hostname and need to refer to it in a ruby script
[14:08:53] <TheJeff> another arbitrary example, but that's the deal
[14:09:34] <TheJeff> and it comes up a lot, and i'm just loading things into textmate and looking for tab lineups
[14:09:44] <TheJeff> and its horrible because its a huge huge huge file that we need to refer too often
[14:11:20] <TheJeff> robertmaxrees: lil help?
[14:11:21] <robertmaxrees> i'm not familiar with any pre-built tools that will give you that.
[14:11:26] <TheJeff> gah
[14:11:31] <TheJeff> ok prebuilt aside
[14:11:35] <robertmaxrees> since that's kind of a backwards thing to want to do :)
[14:11:40] <TheJeff> yeah i know
[14:11:46] <robertmaxrees> ##javascript might have some ideas?  otherwise, http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8790607/javascript-json-get-path-to-given-subnode
[14:11:53] <TheJeff> ok hold on maybe another approach
[14:12:02] <TheJeff> ok so say I open it and find the key that refers to the value
[14:12:09] <TheJeff> is there a quick way to find out all the keys its nested in?
[14:12:46] <robertmaxrees> still kind of backwards - similar problem as before.  you have to enumerate through all keys recursively and manually build the path.
[14:13:22] <TheJeff> yeah thats waht i've been doing but going crosseyed and i thought surely a robot can do this for me
[14:13:29] <TheJeff> its come up often enough to need another way
[14:13:42] <robertmaxrees> something is probably out there but it might be hard to find.
[14:13:54] <TheJeff> ok
[14:13:58] <TheJeff> another question then
[14:14:16] <TheJeff> i was using jqplay (it has a .search.field.that.was.helping.me.check)
[14:14:31] <TheJeff> the value I'm looking for is part of an array
[14:15:55] <robertmaxrees> okay?
[14:17:44] <TheJeff> http://pastebin.com/ZZ2bB5Wb
[14:17:48] <TheJeff> this is a snippet of waht i'm after
[14:17:54] <TheJeff> i need pool_size
[14:18:03] <robertmaxrees> right.
[14:18:15] <robertmaxrees> so you'll need to recursively walk the tree and manually construct your path.
[14:18:25] <adl> Has anyone encountered the "'this' is not a Javascript object message", I get it when going through debug, even though I haven't made any references to jquery other than include the .js file.
[14:18:36] <TheJeff> i was using jqplay and it threw a (seemingly jquery error) when i input .key1.key2.components
[14:18:39] <robertmaxrees> adl huh?
[14:19:03] <TheJeff> robertmaxrees: jq: error (at <stdin>:565): Cannot index array with string "components"
[14:19:12] <deadevilboy> hi ppl
[14:19:27] <TheJeff> robertmaxrees: how can i refer to that??
[14:19:35] <robertmaxrees> TheJeff http://pastebin.com/ZZ2bB5Wb isn't valid json fwiw.
[14:19:55] <TheJeff> robertmaxrees: alright well syntax of that terrible example aside
[14:20:11] <TheJeff> is there a way I can refer to that .using.searches.like.this
[14:20:20] <robertmaxrees> you don't start with a period.
[14:20:33] <TheJeff> ah jqplay requires that
[14:20:37] <TheJeff> i really don't use json much.
[14:20:40] <robertmaxrees> wat
[14:20:49] <TheJeff>  /shrug
[14:21:10] <robertmaxrees> and jq is a json processor - nothing to do with jquery fwiw.
[14:21:20] <TheJeff> :|
[14:21:28] <TheJeff> then I suck a lot for asking that here.
[14:21:34] <TheJeff> and my apologies.
[14:21:39] <robertmaxrees> ;) either way, you need to access it by index.
[14:21:44] <robertmaxrees> or filter to get what you want.,
[14:21:45] <deadevilboy> robertmaxrees: hi there ;) thks for ystday
[14:22:29] <adl> robertmaxress... what's not clear in my question?
[14:22:46] <taplar> adl: what your trying to do
[14:22:48] <robertmaxrees> "Has anyone encountered the "'this' is not a Javascript object message", I get it when going through debug, even though I haven't made any references to jquery other than include the .js file." adl you need to provide context.
[14:22:53] <robertmaxrees> show us the error happening.
[14:23:20] <robertmaxrees> TheJeff i'd trawl their docs, but the path to what you want is .key1.key2.components[1].pool_size
[14:26:58] <adl> it's happening when running in developer tool on IE 11.. I'll see if I can get a log.
[14:27:04] <robertmaxrees> uh
[14:27:07] <robertmaxrees> when doing what?
[14:29:27] <phelix> I have a function called urlParams. so to get the data from it I just use urlParams() but the item that is returned needs to be different. So I really need urlParams().theparameter but theparameter will always be different. Can I set  the item after the period as a variable?
[14:29:30] <phelix> i am not sure that makes any sense at all
[14:30:20] <adl> All that the html file has in it, other than the normal html tags ( html, head, title, body ), is the script tag to include the js file.
[14:30:22] <adl> 		<script type="text/javascript" src="../jquery/js/jquery-1.11.3.js" ></script>
[14:30:36] <adl> and display the word "test"
[14:30:57] <taplar> phelix:'set the item'  what's the item?
[14:31:40] <phelix>  https://jsfiddle.net/vkatpztg/
[14:31:42] <phelix> this might make more sense
[14:31:44] <taplar> var something = urlParams();  something.theparameter = "i can be changed"; ?
[14:32:27] <phelix> yes
[14:32:34] <taplar> sure
[14:32:42] <phelix> .theparameter needs to be different and generated from an ID in the dom
[14:32:45] <taplar> if you can access it you can change it, for the most part
[14:33:02] <phelix> it returns undefined if I try to use a variable for taht
[14:33:34] <taplar> for your example?
[14:33:49] <phelix> yes
[14:34:00] <taplar> console.log() the parameter and see what it is
[14:34:18] <phelix> if i try ar lv = urlParams().urlParamUsed its undefined.
[14:34:26] <taplar> ok, so it doesn't exist
[14:35:19] <taplar> console.log() your xdecode(match[1]) 's to see what your putting on the object
[14:35:50] <taplar> pretty much, just console log stuff to make sure what you expect to be happening is indeed happening, :)
[14:36:34] <phelix> https://jsfiddle.net/vkatpztg/1/
[14:36:38] <phelix> maybe that makes more sense.
[14:37:05] <phelix> I am getting the right response. Just doesn't work when I turn that item after the . into a variable
[14:37:43] <taplar> right, so urlParamUsed is not a property on the returned object
[14:37:57] <taplar> wait
[14:38:05] <taplar> are you trying to use 'urlParamUsed' as a variable?
[14:38:05] <phelix> yes it is
[14:38:10] <phelix> yes
[14:38:19] <taplar> how your using it it is a literal
[14:38:25] <taplar> object[variable] instead
[14:38:29] <phelix> basically to get the right property from the object urlParams
[14:38:57] <taplar> urlParams()[urlParamUsed]
[14:39:22] <taplar> object dot notation is literal.  it doesn't substitute variable values
[14:39:31] <phelix> I have tried that. Doesn't work
[14:39:58] <phelix> I cant even use urlParams()[actualyPropertyName] returns undefined
[14:40:12] <taplar> urlParamUsed = "qrp_ingredientAmount_ING_PROTEIN";
[14:40:25] <phelix> yes that is what it equals
[14:40:33] <taplar> no, i'm saying
[14:40:41] <taplar> x.y == x[y]
[14:40:50] <phelix> Object {qrp_ingredientAmount_ING_PROTEIN: "14-47", ep: "103035 107539"}
[14:40:58] <taplar> and in your snipplet your not "" your key
[14:41:01] <phelix> that is what I get if i just console.log(urlParams());
[14:41:05] <taplar> right
[14:41:41] <taplar> but line 20 your doing: urlParamUsed = qrp_ingredientAmount_ING_PROTEIN
[14:42:02] <taplar> that is trying to set the variable urlParamUsed to the value of the variable qrp_ingredientAmount_ING_PROTEIN, which does not exist
[14:42:04] <phelix> I understand what you mean. But I can do console.log(urlParams()[urlParamUsed]); but is undefined
[14:43:09] <phelix> even if i just try console.log(urlParams()[qrp_ingredientAmount_ING_PROTEIN] it is undefined
[14:43:17] <taplar> your not listening
[14:44:25] <prestorium> hi. I'm using <button> and formaction. How can I get form.action on submit()? Neither this.action nor $(this).action works.
[14:44:48] <prestorium> <form> has no action, so this.action is yielding an empty string
[14:45:23] <phelix> console.log(urlParams()[urlParamUsed]) is same as urlParams().qrp_ingredientAmount_ING_PROTEIN is what your saying right?
[14:45:31] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/0nq2L37z/
[14:46:05] <phelix> k let me check that out one sec. thanks btw
[14:48:14] <taplar> prestorium:what are you binding the submit handler too?
[14:50:53] <phelix> taplar: https://jsfiddle.net/vkatpztg/2/
[14:51:12] <phelix> that shows exactly what code I am using and what each console.log returns...
[14:51:20] <phelix> according to what you showed me it should work
[14:52:21] <taplar> urlParams[urlParamUsed]
[14:52:36] <taplar> i don't see urlParams defined as a variable, only as a function
[14:52:42] <taplar> did you mean: urlParams()[urlParamUsed]
[14:52:43] <taplar> ?
[14:55:29] <stan_man_can_> I'm using the jQuery Validate plugin and getting "Uncaught TypeError: Cammot read property 'nodeName' of undefined" because of this block https://paste.fedoraproject.org/302390/03820891/
[14:56:05] <stan_man_can_> http://jqueryvalidation.org/ for clarification
[14:56:34] <prestorium> taplar, https://jsfiddle.net/tjee6fum/
[14:58:16] <FilipNortic> stan_man_can_: your rules isn't vaild json
[14:58:38] <FilipNortic> and you don't have all your { } closed
[14:59:13] <taplar> prestorium: you may have to bind on the buttons themselves
[14:59:51] <taplar> i'm not seeing that value reflected on the event
[15:00:07] <prestorium> taplar, but it's working without JS
[15:00:20] <stan_man_can_> FilipNortic: Which one isn't closed...?
[15:00:29] <stan_man_can_> FilipNortic: And this is an example from their dogs: $( "#myinput" ).rules( "add", {minlength: 2});
[15:00:52] <taplar> prestorium:it may be, but i don't see anything that changes on the form in regards to which submit was clicked.
[15:01:30] <FilipNortic> the one after 'add',
[15:02:29] <prestorium> taplar, not on this sample, yeah...
[15:03:12] <stan_man_can_> FilipNortic: It's closed on line 4??
[15:05:59] <taplar> prestorium:so what you might do is add a simple click handler on the submits which just puts the formaction on the form as a data-* field.  and then in your existing submit handler you could access that data element
[15:10:04] <prestorium> taplar, ok. thanks
[15:12:42] <FilipNortic> stan_man_can_: right i just assumed there were a .validate around sry for that
[15:17:10] <FilipNortic> stan_man_can_: try consloe.log($('yourselector').rules());
[15:17:47] <stan_man_can_> FilipNortic: Object {required: true}
[15:25:56] <stan_man_can_> any ideads?
[15:25:58] <stan_man_can_> ideas*
[15:33:04] <FilipNortic> stan_man_can_: is yout input in a from which you're calling .validate() on
[15:33:41] <stan_man_can_> FilipNortic: Yeah
[15:35:00] <stan_man_can_> FilipNortic: $("[id$=theForm]").validate();
[15:38:11] <robertmaxrees> yuck
[15:38:17] <robertmaxrees> $("[id$=theForm]") no no no.
[15:39:41] <FilipNortic> robertmaxrees: that did look wierd to me too... but didn't dare to say anthing
[15:39:49] <robertmaxrees> use a class at that point.
[15:41:08] <FilipNortic> hmm yeah the plugin might not like multiple ids if that what you got
[15:41:22] <robertmaxrees> you can't reuse an id anyway.
[15:42:36] <FilipNortic> not really no but there are people that try their hardest to make that work
[15:42:48] <robertmaxrees> and it's still invalid.  so don't do it.
[15:42:56] <robertmaxrees> it never actually words.
[15:42:58] <robertmaxrees> *works
[15:46:11] <bojanlazic> http://vnjs.net/www/project/freewall/example/image-layout.html how could i make this when clicked to open image ?
[15:46:37] <robertmaxrees> bojanlazicyou huh?
[15:46:38] <stan_man_can_> It selects fine
[15:46:44] <robertmaxrees> woops wrong person haha
[15:46:53] <robertmaxrees> bojanlazic what do you mean?
[15:47:03] <stan_man_can_> It's within salesforce, I can't add a custom class, I can't even set the ID, it auto generates it, i can control part of the id though which is whats appended at the end
[15:47:20] <stan_man_can_> hence the id$=theForm, i know the id will END in "theForm" but that's all I can control
[15:47:44] <robertmaxrees> stan_man_can_ then find a way to store all of those elements in an object and .filter() for what you want instead.
[15:47:46] <stan_man_can_> robertmaxrees:  FilipNortic: https://api.jquery.com/attribute-ends-with-selector/
[15:47:55] <stan_man_can_> robertmaxrees: there's only ONE theForm on the page anyways
[15:48:09] <robertmaxrees> stan_man_can_ i'm well aware of WHAT that selector does.
[15:48:11] <robertmaxrees> but it's very slow.
[15:48:33] <robertmaxrees> like, i usually tell people to know prematurely optimize, but that's a classic example of something you can work on ahead of time.
[15:49:41] <robertmaxrees> err, to NOT prematurely optimize.
[15:50:47] <FilipNortic> stan_man_can_: I know what the selector does to but I've seen to many people try to use it (or something like it) to get around id clashes
[15:51:12] <FilipNortic> and if there is only one from you can use $('form')
[15:51:17] <bojanlazic> robertmaxrees: I want to use freewall plugin, but I also want to open image when clicked, how is that doable?
[15:51:44] <robertmaxrees> bojanlazic define "open image when clicked" - you mean take to you another window with just that image?
[15:52:11] <bojanlazic> Yea exactly I would make it as BS3 modal ?
[15:52:25] <robertmaxrees> oh so you want to use a modal for it?
[15:52:34] <bojanlazic> no no
[15:52:38] <bojanlazic> that's just my guess
[15:52:43] <bojanlazic> Not sure how to use it :D
[15:52:47] <robertmaxrees> i'm not clear on what you want.
[15:53:32] <bojanlazic> I want to stay in that window just to get bigger image open over my freewall
[15:53:34] <FilipNortic> stan_man_can_: more to the point no i don't have anymore guess if you can reproduce it in a fiddle I'll take a look at it
[15:53:41] <robertmaxrees> then yes, you want a modal bojanlazic
[15:53:51] <FilipNortic> s/guess/guesses
[15:54:11] <bojanlazic> robertmaxrees:  Thanks very much sir
[16:06:03] <jangoh2> robert
[16:07:37] <robertmaxrees> me?
[16:08:27] <jangoh2> yes
[16:08:42] <jangoh2> $('input[name=term][value="' + $.cookie(value.name) + '"]').prop('checked', true);   why this one doesnt work
[16:08:57] * robertmaxrees looks in his crystal ball
[16:09:02] <robertmaxrees> i have no idea dude.
[16:11:39] <FilipNortic> jangoh2: put in some console.log statments and look what your varibles return
[16:11:43] <robertmaxrees> lol why do people assume i know what their code looks like?
[16:11:59] <robertmaxrees> http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide1 read this guide.
[16:12:03] <robertmaxrees> it will make your life a lot easier.
[16:12:19] <FilipNortic> yeH
[16:13:29] <jangoh2> i guess this one doesnt work  if ($('input[name="'+ elementname + '"]').is('input[type=radio]')) {
[16:13:48] <jangoh2> but this work  if ($('input[name="'+ elementname + '"]').is('input[type=text]')) {
[16:14:46] <jangoh2> FilipNortic http://dpaste.com/248AKX3
[16:14:54] <robertmaxrees> jangoh2 make a jsfiddle instead.
[16:15:03] <robertmaxrees> you pasted that link yesterday - that's not helpful.
[16:15:06] <jangoh2> seems like i cant get the radio type
[16:15:08] <robertmaxrees> abstract out the cookie and make a fiddle.
[16:20:33] <FilipNortic> a tripple nested each is not happy code
[16:23:34] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[16:26:06] <rfr> I take it's better to download jquery than to use a CDN. Is that mostly correct?
[16:26:36] <robertmaxrees> really broad question.
[16:26:39] <robertmaxrees> depends on your metric.
[16:27:30] <robertmaxrees> generally, saving it and then concating and minimizing everything is what you want.
[16:58:23] <BillCriswell> guys
[17:02:59] <taplar> what about the girls?
[17:03:53] <BillCriswell> taplar: It's just an inside joke.
[17:04:12] <BillCriswell> When I helped in here a lot people always busted in saying "guys" then asking really off the wall questions.
[17:04:23] <BillCriswell> and I wanted to mess with robertmaxrees haha
[17:04:34] <taplar> still happens
[17:04:42] <robertmaxrees> guys
[17:04:45] <robertmaxrees> pls i ned halp
[17:04:50] <robertmaxrees> n e body here
[17:04:53] <robertmaxrees> BillCriswell u help?
[17:04:58] <taplar> and the 'hello' followed by nothing
[17:05:03] <robertmaxrees> the old days.
[17:05:13] <robertmaxrees> or the "anybody here?"
[17:05:31] <BillCriswell> The classic rope in!
[17:08:23] <sillyslux> haha robert needs help, first time i read *that
[17:08:33] <arc_> if that happened a lot before, i'm pretty surprised it stopped
[17:08:41] <robertmaxrees> it's slowed down.
[17:08:46] <arc_> i wonder why
[17:08:53] <Robdgreat> People *hate* just asking their effing question
[17:08:56] <robertmaxrees> we've been gettign a lot of people expecting us to just fix their problems lately.
[17:08:56] <sillyslux> !ask
[17:09:06] <arc_> yeah, that's true
[17:09:16] <Robdgreat> they want people to commit to helping without first knowing whether they can
[17:09:24] <taplar> well, it might be a thing were people don't want to be rude
[17:09:30] <Robdgreat> that's bs
[17:09:34] <Robdgreat> this is a support channel
[17:09:36] <taplar> you just show up and ask a question.  vs saying hey first
[17:09:40] <Robdgreat> its PURPOSE is for you to ask your question
[17:09:47] <robertmaxrees> Robdgreat a LOT of people don't understand IRC etiquette.
[17:09:47] <taplar> i'm not disagreeing
[17:09:56] <robertmaxrees> like not PMing people without checking, how to get help, etc.
[17:09:58] <sillyslux> there is one?
[17:10:01] <Robdgreat> it's not a social club. we do chat and have a good time, but foremost it's a place to get help
[17:10:13] <sillyslux> ah pm is bad
[17:10:27] <robertmaxrees> Lots of people ask if they can ask questions.
[17:10:29] <sillyslux> but what's your prob robertmaxrees?
[17:10:39] <sillyslux> like you did :)
[17:10:41] <Robdgreat> sillyslux: he was illustrating others' methods
[17:10:47] <Robdgreat> he wasn't asking for help
[17:10:49] <robertmaxrees> sillyslux i was having a chuckle.
[17:10:59] <sillyslux> grrr, got me
[17:11:03] <Robdgreat> the "n e body" and "u" should have been a tip
[17:11:03] <_Tariq> Do anyone here have experience with JQuery Validation Plugin?
[17:11:08] <sillyslux> came in few mins ago
[17:11:08] <arc_> he is the one who helps
[17:11:10] <robertmaxrees> hahaha
[17:11:16] <robertmaxrees> _Tariq yes, lots of people do.
[17:11:22] <_Tariq> Ah, cool
[17:11:48] <arc_> it seems like .ask should be sent to people in a pm when they join
[17:11:50] <sillyslux> so do i always have to say hello and goodbye?
[17:11:58] <arc_> no :p
[17:12:02] <robertmaxrees> sillyslux we're talking you shouldn't do that.
[17:12:03] <robertmaxrees> no need.
[17:12:09] <_Tariq> I am trying to use the plugin and all I'm really able to do is to stop the submission process and display an alert
[17:12:11] <robertmaxrees> unless you realyl want to.
[17:12:15] <_Tariq> But I can't actually do validations when I press the button
[17:12:20] <sillyslux> that's what i'd expect
[17:12:21] <_Tariq> so it always display the 'alert'
[17:12:31] <sillyslux> in that manner
[17:12:41] <robertmaxrees> _Tariq so what's your question?
[17:12:59] <_Tariq> How do I actually do validations properly using the JQuery Validation Plugin?
[17:13:06] <_Tariq> I'm going to throw my code into a gist
[17:13:13] <robertmaxrees> *jQuery, and make a functioning fiddle instead :D
[17:13:38] <_Tariq> got it
[17:13:46] <_Tariq> Sorry, I just got used to JCrop
[17:13:50] <_Tariq> with its weird capitalization rules
[17:13:51] <robertmaxrees> it's cool.
[17:14:33] <arc_> i would say you solving your own problem is the best possible outcome ;)
[17:15:01] <robertmaxrees> arc_ hahaha, in this case it's one of those "I have a fix, i know what the *right* fix is, but i'm looking for the middle ground"
[17:15:28] <FilipNortic> yeah, lots if people doesn't even google first
[17:16:28] <robertmaxrees> FilipNortic or don't read documentation they're linked.
[17:17:33] <arc_> dude .. that's so many words. can't you just show me how to do it? aka write my code for me?
[17:18:15] <robertmaxrees> or they claim they read it when really they just scrolled to the first example on the page and copy/pasted it.
[17:18:20] <arc_> lol : (
[17:18:26] <taplar> my favorite one really is the whole, here try this....
[17:18:31] <taplar> but it's due tomorrow!!!
[17:18:40] <robertmaxrees> hahaha
[17:18:51] <_Tariq> https://jsfiddle.net/#&togetherjs=NTUUeivq6f
[17:18:54] <taplar> just.... just show me and i'll learn it later!
[17:19:09] <robertmaxrees> _Tariq erm.
[17:19:18] <_Tariq> Huh
[17:19:20] <_Tariq> Yeah er
[17:19:28] <_Tariq> I didn't see the chat
[17:19:29] <robertmaxrees> it needs to function.
[17:19:35] <_Tariq> Wait, what?
[17:19:37] <_Tariq> What do you mean?
[17:19:52] <robertmaxrees> you need to atually load in jquery and jquery validate.
[17:20:26] <_Tariq> That's what the external resources are for
[17:20:35] <robertmaxrees> i'm not seeing anything in there..
[17:20:45] <arc_> but they're relative urls
[17:20:59] <arc_> get rid of that stuff and load it through the jsfiddle settings
[17:21:08] <_Tariq> Got it
[17:21:13] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/Lwqe0157/ this has your markup fixed and jquery added - load validate via the external resources on the left-hand side, hit "update" and share out the new link :)
[17:21:45] <arc_> btw did jsfiddle always have that tidy button?
[17:21:55] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[17:22:11] <arc_> never noticed it before. it's quite useful with people's ridiculous messes
[17:22:16] <taplar> is $().ready valid?
[17:22:29] <_Tariq> I'm trying to look at robertmaxrees' markup, and I am confused
[17:22:30] <robertmaxrees> taplar yep - it works.
[17:22:33] <_Tariq> where is jquery added?
[17:22:33] <taplar> k
[17:22:41] <arc_> _Tariq there is a button at the top right of each quadrant
[17:22:43] <robertmaxrees> _Tariq you don't use body tags or html tags for fiddles.
[17:22:53] <_Tariq> Ah
[17:22:56] <_Tariq> Now I see it
[17:22:56] <arc_> the javascript one allows you to set jquery version and add other external resources
[17:22:58] <robertmaxrees> just the basic snippet of html.
[17:23:50] <_Tariq> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/Lwqe0157/
[17:23:58] <robertmaxrees> hit "update" and share out the new link.
[17:24:05] <_Tariq> ah
[17:24:13] <robertmaxrees> :)
[17:25:00] <_Tariq> Clicking on the submit button leads to the form being submitted instead of any actual alert
[17:25:15] <robertmaxrees> console errors?
[17:25:21] <_Tariq> Oh right
[17:25:28] <_Tariq> I need to include the jquery validation plugin
[17:25:29] <asidjazz> robertmaxrees is the hero #jquery deserves, but not the one it nees right now, so we'll keep asking, because he can url it, because hes not our hero, hes a silent guardian, a watchful ircer, a dark javscripter
[17:25:41] <robertmaxrees> hahahahaha
[17:25:44] <robertmaxrees> something like that.
[17:25:57] <_Tariq> https://jsfiddle.net/Lwqe0157/4/
[17:26:03] <taplar> dark javascripter.....
[17:26:26] <robertmaxrees> _Tariq cool, so you're asking for what kind of help?
[17:26:31] <arc_> i get an alert when i click
[17:26:39] <_Tariq> I need validations
[17:26:57] <_Tariq> I need the JQuery Validator to display a message when I click the button
[17:26:58] <robertmaxrees> is this as far as you got?
[17:27:00] <_Tariq> Yes.
[17:27:07] <_Tariq> And I looked at the tutorial
[17:27:09] <_Tariq> and I'm confused.
[17:27:44] <_Tariq> Because this code matches the tutorial
[17:27:53] <_Tariq> and all I can do is click on a button and see "submitted"
[17:27:57] <_Tariq> no matter how invalid the data is
[17:28:44] <robertmaxrees> which tutorial?
[17:29:35] <_Tariq> Er...
[17:29:47] <_Tariq> The tutorial where I looked at JQuery Validator code
[17:29:50] <_Tariq> and determine what it is doing
[17:29:58] <robertmaxrees> right, which one?
[17:30:16] <_Tariq> view-source:http://jqueryvalidation.org/files/demo/milk/
[17:30:19] <_Tariq> Glorious jutorial
[17:30:37] <_Tariq> *tutorial
[17:30:49] <robertmaxrees> you see where your code differs, right?
[17:30:55] <_Tariq> Er...no.
[17:31:00] <_Tariq> I mean, I don't have mockajax
[17:31:03] <robertmaxrees> errorPlacement?
[17:31:21] <_Tariq> Er...
[17:31:22] <robertmaxrees> messages?  etc.
[17:31:28] <_Tariq> I have messages, right?
[17:31:47] <robertmaxrees> what about errorPlacement?
[17:31:58] <_Tariq> I don't have that, let me place it in there
[17:32:31] <arc_> this isn't really a tutorial, it's just an example. i wonder if there is something that actually has a step by step explanation of what the code is doing
[17:32:40] <arc_> i mean there's documentation but that's not quite the same
[17:32:41] <robertmaxrees> yeah, you're missing a ton of stuff fwiw.
[17:33:39] <_Tariq> arc_: Yeah, usually examples are enough for me to tell me what to do
[17:33:44] <_Tariq> But this doesn't seem enough
[17:34:12] <_Tariq> and I have to avoid a lot of stuff because I don't need a fakeajax, username suggestions, etc.
[17:34:25] <_Tariq> And I'd like to learn how the thing works instead of needlessly copying and pasting code
[17:35:35] <arc_> well, reading the relevant parts of the documentation is probably what you want to do then
[17:36:07] <taplar> yeah, start basic.  and then figure out what you want to do next, and check the docs on how to do that, and repeat
[17:36:44] <_Tariq> Yeah
[17:36:52] <_Tariq> I'm also going to google to see if there are any tutorials
[17:37:07] <taplar> lol, you hate docs, don't cha
[17:37:14] <_Tariq> what, no
[17:37:16] <_Tariq> I love docs.
[17:37:19] <_Tariq> Docs are essential
[17:37:26] <_Tariq> I just consider tutorials to be part of documentation
[17:39:22] <taplar> most of the jqueryvalidate doc pages appear to have code snipplets showing an example of the option that's being described
[17:46:43] <_Tariq> The code snippets aren't really helping
[17:49:52] <_Tariq> As soon as I click submit, the alert is raised
[17:49:56] <taplar> yeah i thought so
[17:49:56] <_Tariq> instead of validations
[17:49:58] <taplar> ok, one thing
[17:50:08] <taplar> jqueryvalidate rules go against element names, not ids
[17:50:17] <taplar> so doing a rule for username won't work
[17:50:21] <taplar> as you named it user[name]
[17:50:35] <_Tariq> ...wow.
[17:50:42] <_Tariq> That explains a lot
[17:50:52] <_Tariq> so what are the ids for then?
[17:51:07] <taplar> as far as jqueryvalidate is concerned?  dunno
[17:51:58] <taplar> but traditionally submitted forms submit their inputs as name=value with the name being the name="" field, so it makes sense that the form validation would want to use those
[17:52:42] <_Tariq> I got a validation
[17:52:47] <_Tariq> but now this is going to get odd fast
[17:52:54] <_Tariq> since I don't know if jquery would accept user[name]
[17:53:08] <robertmaxrees> why would you use that as the name anyway?
[17:53:46] <_Tariq> Because Ruby-land has a convention of using brackets in the name
[17:54:01] <_Tariq> to refer to the fact that the user resource has the name attribute, etc.
[17:54:01] <robertmaxrees> but you already have context O.o
[17:54:13] <robertmaxrees> that's weird.
[17:54:14] <_Tariq> Er, can you explain?
[17:54:37] <robertmaxrees> the form should be submitting to an end point that accepts user data.
[17:55:25] <robertmaxrees> so anything coming across could safely be assumed to be user data.
[17:55:38] <_Tariq> I don't remember why that convention exist
[17:55:41] <_Tariq> so maybe I need to research it
[17:55:47] <_Tariq> anyway, JQuery can accept weird names
[17:56:03] <_Tariq> ' "user[name]": { required: true } '
[17:56:08] <taplar> i know other language will do it with dot notation, and when it's submitted it auto compiles them into their related domain objects
[17:56:18] <taplar> probably something like that in ruby
[17:56:36] <robertmaxrees> _Tariq the jquery validate docs cover taht topic.
[17:56:44] <_Tariq> Ruby can handle name='username'
[17:56:53] <_Tariq> I just don't want to violate conventions
[17:56:57] <robertmaxrees> http://jqueryvalidation.org/reference/#link-fields-with-complex-names-%28brackets-dots%29
[17:57:00] <_Tariq> though I may need to study them to know why that's there
[17:57:13] <_Tariq> robertmaxrees: Ah, got it
[17:57:23] <_Tariq> so I do need to read docs a lot more carefully
[17:57:26] <taplar> :)
[17:57:28] <robertmaxrees> :)
[17:57:31] <_Tariq> than just doing shotgunning debugging
[17:57:31] <_Tariq> Oops
[17:57:45] <taplar> you did say you wanted to -understand- it
[17:58:09] <_Tariq> True
[17:58:20] <_Tariq> Do you think I did understand it?
[17:58:37] <taplar> apparently not, :)
[17:58:43] <_Tariq> Ah well.
[17:58:49] <_Tariq> Moving forward then
[17:58:59] <_Tariq> Thanks for your help!
[17:59:04] <_Tariq> I really appreciate it.
[18:03:32] <taplar> man, three more days of on call.  can't be over fast enough, lol.  later peeps.
[18:27:00] <jangoh2> finally fixed them http://dpaste.com/134QX2M
[18:27:42] <jangoh2> someone might need it to save form data :D
[18:27:58] <robertmaxrees> you're not saving form data in cookies are you?
[18:28:32] <jangoh2> yes in cookies
[18:28:39] <robertmaxrees> uh
[18:28:39] <robertmaxrees> why?
[18:28:48] <jangoh2> $.cookie  works with cookie plugin
[18:29:26] <robertmaxrees> why are you storing form data in cookies?
[18:29:42] <jangoh2> just to play with this for now
[18:29:49] <robertmaxrees> erm
[18:29:59] <robertmaxrees> cookies are a bad idea for this >.>
[18:30:02] <jangoh2> whats the better storage localstorage?
[18:30:13] <robertmaxrees> not doing it clientside.  otherwise, localstorage.
[18:30:52] <FilipNortic> or sessionstorage
[18:31:00] <robertmaxrees> depending on what he's doing.
[18:31:10] <robertmaxrees> i'm going to guess this is some kind of persistent deal
[18:31:52] <jangoh2> aright i am checking them thanx :)
[18:32:15] <robertmaxrees> but really, do it serverside.
[18:35:01] <FilipNortic> yeah it fine to play with it and see what happends but you always have less controll of what is going on clientside and there is quite a few things that can go wrong if you store to much in prod.
[18:35:37] <FilipNortic> to much being more than you absoutly need
[18:36:30] <jangoh2> actually i dont need to control them by php
[18:36:38] <robertmaxrees> you should.
[18:37:11] <jangoh2> will destroy them on submit
[18:38:54] <FilipNortic> yeah but then there is always the option of them never submiting. And you think that is exactly what you want storage for but...
[18:39:35] <FilipNortic> it may pop up in strange ways later
[18:43:26] <jangoh2> hehe might be
[20:10:32] <jeffreylevesque> I'm using reactjs: how can i `require / include` another js file (the compile jsx file) in a js file?
[20:10:46] <robertmaxrees> wrong channel to ask in ;)
[20:22:02] <jeffreylevesque> can jquery require / include another js file?
[20:28:38] <shoky_> jeffreylevesque it can add a <script> element to the DOM,  or it can download a js file via ajax and eval() its contents
[20:28:56] <shoky_> neither is something you should really be wanting to do
[20:30:06] <shoky_> use a tool like browserify/babel
[21:01:35] <hassoon> i was told that using evenet handlers in seperate js files is better than using things like onclick="function_name(argument)" within the tags
[21:01:40] <hassoon> but why's that ? :o
[23:01:05] <shibly> https://bpaste.net/show/e56589e9d4af , how can i get the value of hidden input element?
[23:16:49] <shibly> https://jsfiddle.net/ay7rwz23/ , how can i get the value of hidden input ?
