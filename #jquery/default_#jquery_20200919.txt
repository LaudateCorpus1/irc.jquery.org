[01:22:21] <jak2000> hi all
[01:22:27] <jak2000> any online html validator?
[17:53:52] <anonymou_> Hello
[17:54:06] <robertmaxrees> good afternoon
[17:55:16] <anonymou_> i need change select element but need a load event
[17:55:45] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[17:55:54] <anonymou_> because this element after change, load another query
[17:56:49] <robertmaxrees> not sure i'm following :)
[17:57:48] <robertmaxrees> anonymou_ are you asking how to change an element after it loads into the page via ajax?
[17:59:31] <anonymou_> yes
[17:59:48] <anonymou_> i'm use this: $("#checkout_country").val("United States").trigger('change');
[18:00:12] <robertmaxrees> anonymou_ you'll want to modify the code that's doing the ajax call instead
[18:00:22] <anonymou_> change #checkout_country selected, but not load another event
[18:01:04] <robertmaxrees> anonymou_ i think i'm still confused haha - can you share your code in a jsfiddle?
[18:04:27] <anonymou_> open This link: https://tinyurl.com/yxkxcbdg.
[18:04:27] <anonymou_> ,please change country field to "United State", this time you see state field.
[18:04:41] <robertmaxrees> lol
[18:05:00] <robertmaxrees> ok.
[18:05:02] <robertmaxrees> then what?
[18:05:16] <anonymou_> i need change select box to united state with jquery and run state parameters
[18:05:44] <robertmaxrees> okay.  did you write the original code for the dropdown?
[18:06:08] <anonymou_> Unfortunately no
[18:06:25] <robertmaxrees> is it a plugin or something?
[18:06:33] <anonymou_> I need this change so I don't have to write from scratch
[18:07:08] <anonymou_> another code
[18:07:19] <robertmaxrees> please be more specific.
[18:07:55] <robertmaxrees> could you share the code for that dropdown interaction somewhere?
[18:08:00] <anonymou_> I copied this code from another site
[18:08:30] <robertmaxrees> that's fine.  i still need to see it.
[18:08:37] <anonymou_> Because it is complicated, I am looking for an easier solution
[18:08:40] <robertmaxrees> ...
[18:08:49] <robertmaxrees> lol you're not really giving me much to work with here :)
[18:09:31] <robertmaxrees> part of the problem is you might not be able to use jquery to do this at all depending on how the original handler was written.
[18:09:33] <anonymou_> Is it possible to change the country to activate the state automatically?
[18:09:52] <robertmaxrees> i have no way of knowing without seeing the code powering the current interaction.
[18:09:59] <robertmaxrees> which is why i keep asking to see that code.
[18:19:57] <robertmaxrees> lol welp.
[18:22:43] <robertmaxrees> anonymou_ btw that country dropdown doesn't fire an ajax request.
[18:23:16] <anonymou_> My problem was solved
[18:23:28] <robertmaxrees> how did you solve it?
[18:24:27] <anonymou_> You are very interested in reading the codes, please understand by reading
[18:24:36] <anonymou_> have good day
[18:24:42] <robertmaxrees> lmao
[18:24:48] <robertmaxrees> cool bro :)
