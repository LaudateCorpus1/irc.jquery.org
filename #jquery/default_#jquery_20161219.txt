[00:04:22] <solice> how about this https://jsfiddle.net/1vf1ug49/5/
[00:05:05] <solice> does that work for you Darmani
[00:06:37] <Darmani> Perfectly. Wow
[00:07:21] <Darmani> I have to display custom error messages for each group though so I figured out it's probably best to not have all the logic in one function.
[00:07:34] <Darmani> I think it would be better to have different functions for each group.
[00:09:00] <solice> not sure it is perfect
[00:09:39] <Darmani> solice: I'm trying to run this in the console but I only get back defined...
[00:09:39] <Darmani> var len =  $('.checkbox-group.required').length;
[00:09:42] <Darmani> Why is that?
[00:09:44] <solice> you can select multiple on on row and the logic breaks
[00:09:45] <Darmani> undefined*
[00:24:13] <solice> Darmani i think this is a little better https://jsfiddle.net/1vf1ug49/6/
[00:26:16] <Darmani> solice: yeah that way is better. The other way you could check all the boxes in one row and it would pass =p
[00:27:13] <solice> exactly
[00:28:08] <solice> ultimately the each() should be in a function and you would receive back a true or false to see if it is passed
[00:28:44] <Darmani> Probably right.
[00:37:13] <solice> Darmani much happier with this https://jsfiddle.net/1vf1ug49/7/
[00:38:10] <solice> its best to extrapolate the logic/processing into a function
[00:38:32] <Darmani> checking
[00:40:34] <Darmani> *clap clap*
[00:40:36] <Darmani> solice: Bravo.
[00:40:39] <Darmani> I like it.
[02:48:48] <Epoch`_> I've been building an app with jQuery mobile, but am a bit stuck how I could send an "auth" token in every request header (forms, page loads, etc). Is there an easy way to do this with the current architecture?
[03:00:48] <Cork> Epoch`_: basic auth doesn't work very well with browsers as there is no way to logout
[03:02:30] <Epoch`_> Cork, I'm not sure I'll be using "basic auth" as it is now, but a setting my own custom header on each request: foo-token
[03:02:50] <Cork> ya, that isn't basic auth
[03:02:57] <Cork> it's just sending a header
[03:03:02] <Cork> and ya, that works
[03:03:13] <Epoch`_> so, I asked... How do I set custom headers for every jQuery Mobile requst? :)
[03:03:29] <Cork> have a look at $.ajaxSetup
[03:06:30] <Epoch`_> Cork++  I wish I had arms long enough to reach out and give you a high five. It looks like that'll cut it
[03:06:47] <Epoch`_> There's a "header" option
[03:13:35] <Epoch`_> See, now it's easy.... When the user logs in, I can store that token in the localstorage, and send it every request encrypted (HTTPS) in the headers to authorize every request if needed. I'll renew it periodically with a new token.
[03:45:22] <Epoch`_> another question I'm stuck on is getting the event callback from jQuery mobile forms.  Some are ajax, some are not. Most POST to a hidden iframe.  I could either detect that iframe content changed, or capture the form complete event.
[03:45:41] <Epoch`_> My preference would be to capture the iframe change, but a simple .ready() listener doesn't seem to cut it.
[04:08:58] <Epoch`_> OK, hacked something that kind of works: http://pastebin.com/xzMCPJe1
[04:09:27] <prase_nick> Epoch`_ HI
[04:14:26] <Epoch`_> random
[04:23:04] <Epoch`_> Cork, of course.... $.ajaxSetup isn't working for me. Clearly the easy solution is never in my favor =(  (jQuery mobile is not sending the header on any request)
[04:23:46] <Cork> ya, jqm is doing a lot of special moching around
[04:23:59] <Cork> can't help you much there though (i don't use jqm)
[04:26:22] <Epoch`_> and to add more worse for misery, "header" is a term for some UI element in jqm, so I can't readily google about request headers =P
[04:26:46] <funkt> Hi there I am trying to target each parent li and use the text and add this to the first sub li which has been appended any ideas? https://jsfiddle.net/nuccgaa3/8/
[04:28:46] <Cork> funkt: you can't really do that
[04:28:53] <funkt> https://jsfiddle.net/0r7nyge0/ cleaner version
[04:29:00] <funkt> Oh really? why not?
[04:29:05] <Cork> funkt: cause the li will contain all the text from the ul child and that's li children
[04:29:11] <funkt> I know
[04:29:12] <Cork> funkt: add a span around the text you want
[04:29:24] <funkt> do you think I would need an each loop?
[04:29:34] <Cork> yes, but you need more elements in the html
[04:29:41] <funkt> Can you see what I am trying to illustrate?
[04:29:56] <funkt> How do you mean ? a surrounding div perhaps?
[04:31:06] <Cork> funkt: https://jsfiddle.net/nuccgaa3/10/
[04:31:20] <Cork> opps missed removing the x declaration
[04:31:26] <funkt> haha!!!
[04:31:29] <Cork> funkt: https://jsfiddle.net/nuccgaa3/11/
[04:31:34] <funkt> Thank you!!!!
[04:31:57] <funkt> I do so appreciate that!
[04:32:02] <Cork> also note that i used $('<li>').text() to generate the new element
[04:32:16] <funkt> I see!
[04:32:25] <Cork> try to avoid using '' + '' as that is exposed to xss attacks
[04:32:29] <funkt> So i needed just a span huh to target?
[04:32:37] <Cork> well .html or $() values
[04:32:50] <Cork> funkt: not to target, but to separate the text from the ul
[04:32:57] <funkt> I see!!
[04:33:06] <funkt> otherwise it is confused!
[04:33:14] <Cork> no, not confused
[04:33:25] <funkt> do you think that would be the only way to do it!
[04:33:30] <Cork> but the ul is part of the li, so .text() on the li will contain what is in the ul too
[04:33:39] <funkt> I get it!
[04:33:51] <Cork> lots of exclamation marks...
[04:34:17] <funkt> Sorry I have been after this for so long
[04:38:09] <funkt> Cork what is an xss attack?
[04:46:11] <funkt> Cheers Cork
[05:46:25] <SaraDR> Hi, I'm using a simple on click slideToggle. Is there a way to prevent subsequential clicks from being queued up, so it starts flipping back and fourth multiple times?
[05:48:38] <AdamPDotty> Use a simple one click slideToggle!
[05:49:50] <SaraDR> The one()? I still want it togglable, just not to queue up the clicks, while the sliding is happening.
[05:50:20] <SaraDR> e.g. if there was a predicate I could check if it's currently sliding or not.
[05:51:48] <AdamPDotty> You can try something like on click slided=false and at the end of the handler slided=true, plus at the begin if (slided) return;
[05:52:05] <AdamPDotty> kind of a lock
[05:53:50] <SaraDR> The function argument is called upon finishing right?
[05:55:53] <AdamPDotty> you mean click function on mouseup?
[05:56:54] <SaraDR> No, but it was. I'll try adding a lock and setting it on click and again when finished, might have some issues regarding multible states from various buttons. Thinking about just only allowing one slide at the time globally.
[05:57:08] <SaraDR> Thanks for the suggestion AdamPDotty.
[06:04:43] <ilhami> Hi!
[06:05:04] <ilhami> What should I use for drag and drop like when you want to order something?
[06:05:08] <ilhami> jQuery UI? or anything else?
[06:26:07] <hellyeah> ilhami:
[06:26:17] <hellyeah> jquery ui has droppable, draggable plugin
[06:37:56] <ilhami> but I think html5 also comes with drag and drop?
[06:37:58] <ilhami> am  I wrong?
[08:23:57] <Cork> ilhami: yes, html/dom has d&d support
[08:24:08] <Cork> ilhami: a side note, html5 is marketing speak, it isn't a standard
[08:24:27] <Cork> the standard is "html living standard" or just "html"
[08:24:48] <Cork> they dropped the version number as there won't ever be another version
[08:26:46] <ilhami> :p but how well does the native drag and drop work?
[08:27:08] <Cork> it works fine, it still requires js though
[08:27:23] <Cork> as you need to react to the event triggering for it to work
[08:28:19] <ilhami> and it is supported by all browsers? :)
[08:28:39] <ilhami> it's not.
[08:28:41] <ilhami> http://caniuse.com/#feat=dragndrop
[08:28:49] <Cork> basically ya, as the feature is a standardization of the old ie solution
[08:29:04] <ilhami> doesn't work on phones.
[08:29:16] <Cork> well... ya?
[08:29:32] <Cork> how can you drag when drag moves the page?
[08:30:01] <ilhami> lol
[08:30:30] <ilhami> true that.
[08:30:43] <Cork> you might be able to get it working there by some hackering, donno haven't tried
[08:31:15] <ilhami> I need to go rest for a bit. Thanks for your answers Cork.
[09:19:38] <guardian> hello
[09:19:40] <guardian> <input type="text" class="test"/>
[09:19:42] <guardian> oops
[09:19:44] <guardian> is there something special to receive the keyup event when pressing ESC on <input type="text" class="test"/>
[09:19:46] <guardian> all I get is the blur event
[09:20:04] <guardian> http://jsfiddle.net/5wa49eyp/
[09:20:06] <Cork> most likely no
[09:20:16] <Cork> some events are special and you can't do much about them
[09:21:02] <guardian> you're saying it's not possible to receive it?
[09:21:42] <Cork> depends on the browser
[09:22:02] <Cork> esc works on the test page for me though
[09:22:30] <guardian> on the jsfiddle i pasted?
[09:22:37] <Cork> yes
[09:22:38] <guardian> in chrome, I'm getting only the blur event
[09:22:41] <guardian> chrome for mac
[09:22:48] <Cork> might be a mac thing then
[09:22:57] <Cork> works in both chrome and firefox here
[09:23:21] <guardian> so you get keyup.27 then blur?
[09:23:27] <Cork> no blur
[09:23:58] <guardian> interesting
[09:24:02] <Cork> but ya, i get keydown.27 / keyup.27
[09:24:04] <guardian> on firefox I don't get blur()
[09:24:09] <guardian> dammit
[09:24:51] <guardian> alright found the culprit
[09:24:58] <guardian> the vimium extension...
[09:25:02] <Cork> ah
[09:25:11] <guardian> thanks for caring, was helpful :)

[11:21:29] <ExoUNX> greetings
[11:21:44] <ExoUNX> trying to identify where the problem lies
[11:21:57] <ExoUNX> think it might be with our outdated jQuery version
[11:22:42] <ExoUNX> iOS 9 seems to have broken our page where the top portion doesn't show, and iOS 10 further breaks this preventing people from seeing important information
[11:23:04] <ExoUNX> I was curious if there's a site to view incompatibilities with iOS or something similar
[11:26:27] <ExoUNX> I'm currently on jQuery v1.10.2
[11:29:35] <Qiller> Friends, how can i get div class html content before clicked item? like: <div class="test">how one</div> <div class="click">click one</div> <div class="test">how two</div> <div class="click">click two</div>
[11:30:16] <Qiller> get .test content before .click trigger.
[11:32:17] <shoky_> Qiller: usually you want $(this).closest('.someParent').find('.test')   but if you need exactly what you said, then:  $(this).prevAll('.test').first()
[11:33:13] <Qiller> shoky_: ty

[11:51:19] <ilhami> Hey. Is it fine to use DataTables for all kind of tabular data? :)
[11:51:34] <duch_kazatel> i'd hit up a freelance channel instea
[11:52:04] <duch_kazatel> ilhami use it for whatever you want.  not sure what the question means.
[11:52:27] <ilhami> I am just wondering when the limit is for usage of tables. :P
[11:52:33] <duch_kazatel> tabular data.
[12:03:44] <hackal> Any idea when I try to make POST request using ajax I see error in network tab but instead of POST I see OPTIONS
[12:04:33] <duch_kazatel> doing a cross-domain request?
[12:05:21] <duch_kazatel> hackal
[12:06:18] <hackal> hmm that is weird, I am sure my api has cors allowed
[12:14:27] <ilhami> Maybe, maybe not. :P
[12:14:40] <duch_kazatel> ?
[12:16:45] <Qiller> shoky_: working fine, thank you!
[12:21:19] <duch_kazatel> weeeee
[12:25:42] <ilhami> weeeee
[13:42:13] <ilhami> jQuery!!! you kill me.
[13:42:18] <duch_kazatel> ?
[13:45:24] <ilhami> duch_kazatel, it takes so many lines of jQuery to do just a couple of things. :D
[13:45:38] <ilhami> already have 265 lines of jQuery lol
[13:45:44] <duch_kazatel> *javascript.
[13:45:50] <duch_kazatel> and that means you're likely doing something wrong.
[13:46:16] <ilhami> no! I am not.
[13:46:20] <duch_kazatel> lol
[13:46:23] <ilhami> :D
[13:46:23] <duch_kazatel> oh ok.
[13:46:30] <ilhami> I just have a lot of code. Hehe
[13:46:38] <duch_kazatel> that's not the fault of the library fwiw.
[13:46:46] <ilhami> but maybe a framework like vue.js would have done wonders
[13:46:53] <duch_kazatel> ^
[13:46:54] <ilhami> with model binding.
[13:47:00] <duch_kazatel> or react.
[13:47:06] <duch_kazatel> with the flux pattern
[13:47:09] <ilhami> yeah
[13:47:22] <ilhami> I am using pure jQuery lol.
[13:47:23] <duch_kazatel> misapplication of tools is a problem.
[13:47:45] <ilhami> jQuery is awesome for pure DOM manipulation.
[13:48:04] <duch_kazatel> that's all you should be doing with it.
[13:49:59] <ilhami> I am using it for ajax as well.
[13:50:27] <duch_kazatel> yep.
[13:51:25] <duch_kazatel> still DOM technically.
[13:51:53] <ilhami> :-))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))

[15:16:53] <duch_kazatel> this guy
[15:49:45] <pippuccio76> hi sorry for english is there a way to serialize with file ?
[15:52:17] <duch_kazatel> not really?
[15:52:31] <duch_kazatel> like, you could serialize and then inject the file after the fact using formdata
[16:09:52] <duch_kazatel> #neat
[16:14:13] <taplar> #whatstwitter
[16:17:29] <pippuccio76> Can u get me an example with this code :
[16:17:31] <pippuccio76> https://jsfiddle.net/rc9x0jqt/
[16:17:37] <duch_kazatel> lol
[16:17:42] <duch_kazatel> nope.
[16:17:47] <duch_kazatel> you can show us what you've tried.
[16:18:19] <duch_kazatel> also: fix your js
[16:18:44] <duch_kazatel> https://jsfiddle.net/onsv51yh/2/
[16:21:44] <pippuccio76> https://jsfiddle.net/onsv51yh/3/
[16:21:55] <duch_kazatel> right.
[16:21:59] <pippuccio76> but file are not sending
[16:22:25] <duch_kazatel> erm
[16:22:29] <taplar> outer most selector is wrong
[16:22:36] <duch_kazatel> ^
[16:22:41] <duch_kazatel> also, just use formData here.
[16:22:44] <duch_kazatel> if you wnat to send a file.
[16:23:12] <pippuccio76> is cross browser?
[16:23:27] <duch_kazatel> erm
[16:23:45] <duch_kazatel> if you care about that, then you can't really ajax files like this in the first place.
[16:25:21] <pippuccio76> formdata instead serialize?
[16:25:36] <duch_kazatel> if you care about cross-browser, you can't use ajax.
[16:25:42] <duch_kazatel> not sure how else to phrase that.
[16:25:53] <duch_kazatel> old Ie doesn't handle ajaxing files.
[16:26:15] <pippuccio76> ie 8?
[16:26:53] <duch_kazatel> yep.
[16:27:08] <pippuccio76> https://jsfiddle.net/onsv51yh/4/ is ok ?
[16:27:13] <duch_kazatel> no.
[16:27:16] <duch_kazatel> again
[16:27:26] <duch_kazatel> you can not use ajax to send files in old ie.
[16:27:55] <pippuccio76> ok but the code its ok?
[16:28:06] <duch_kazatel> #myform doesn't select anything.
[16:28:24] <pippuccio76> with serialize select all variables
[16:28:29] <duch_kazatel> ...
[16:28:33] <taplar> lol
[16:28:39] <duch_kazatel>  $("#myform") doesn't work.
[16:28:43] <duch_kazatel> there's no #myform
[16:28:50] <taplar> and the outer selector is still broken
[16:29:13] <duch_kazatel> also: $("#myform").formData(); - formData() doesn't work like thjat.
[16:29:28] <pippuccio76> its true :https://jsfiddle.net/onsv51yh/5/
[16:29:37] <duch_kazatel> ...
[16:29:46] <duch_kazatel> great - you still can't use formdata that way.
[16:29:51] <duch_kazatel> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FormData/FormData
[16:29:56] <duch_kazatel> it's not a jquery method.
[16:30:06] <duch_kazatel> you need to manually add stuff to the object.
[16:31:57] <pippuccio76> i must append every field?
[16:34:01] <duch_kazatel> correct.
[16:34:05] <pippuccio76> i have a form with 10 line , every line have 1 file and 5 select , can i use serialize plus formdata?
[16:34:20] <duch_kazatel> i wouldn't use serialize here.
[16:35:14] <pippuccio76> i must append 55 field?
[16:35:35] <duch_kazatel> yes.
[16:35:46] <pippuccio76> :(
[16:41:26] <bjsnider> if i'm targeting a span id using a var, is it 'span#' + var ?
[16:41:49] <duch_kazatel> yeah, but don't prepend with 'span'
[16:42:12] <bjsnider> why?
[16:42:15] <acidjazz> right, an id should be unique therefor not needing to specify the element type
[16:42:17] <duch_kazatel> faster.
[16:42:28] <duch_kazatel> IDs are unique, so you don't need the tag type.
[16:42:41] <duch_kazatel> tag type shouldn't matter much to your JS.
[16:43:46] <pippuccio76> Sorry another answer , is there a way to show only a progess bar sending several file with post , is there an example ?
[16:43:59] <bjsnider> there's an input with the same id next to it
[16:44:13] <duch_kazatel> bjsnider that's not valid.
[16:44:51] <bjsnider> i can use another attribute, how do i capture name?
[16:44:51] <duch_kazatel> pippuccio76 yep - lots of examples out there.  search around :)
[16:45:05] <duch_kazatel> bjsnider don't select on names.
[16:45:09] <duch_kazatel> use unique IDs.
[16:45:35] <duch_kazatel> or semantic classes.
[16:45:40] <bjsnider> well, i have to match the input to the span somehow
[16:45:42] <duch_kazatel> or select a parent and then .find() what you want.
[16:45:49] <duch_kazatel> aren't they next to each other?>
[16:45:56] <duch_kazatel> and what's their relationship?
[16:46:49] <bjsnider> the input reveals a button inside the span
[16:46:58] <bjsnider> by removing css that hides it
[16:47:25] <duch_kazatel> i'd have to see it, but tbh some semantic markup is all you need there.
[16:48:24] <duch_kazatel> if you really think you need something to tie them together, you could use data attributes.
[16:48:49] <duch_kazatel> though i'd go with a more widget-y kind of idae.
[16:49:40] <bjsnider> i can use id on the input and toss the same value into a class on the span. it's all scripted anyway, so i can organize it however i want
[16:49:52] <duch_kazatel> that's not really a good idea either.
[16:50:04] <duch_kazatel> because now you're conflating the point of IDs and Classes.
[16:50:11] <bjsnider> so if it was a class i'd do 'span.' + var ?
[16:50:15] <duch_kazatel> lol
[16:50:19] <duch_kazatel> sure.
[16:50:26] <duch_kazatel> but i'd rethink that strategy, too (shrug)
[17:03:29] <bjsnider> if i do it that way it removes hide from all buttons instead of just the one i clicked
[17:04:00] <duch_kazatel> right, which is why you better organize your js.
[17:04:01] <duch_kazatel> :)
[17:04:05] <duch_kazatel> and make it relative.
[17:04:14] <duch_kazatel> since they share a container, that should be super easy.
[17:08:52] <duch_kazatel> (shrug) welp
[17:14:06] <bjsnider> why is fiddle allowing me to select  more than one radio button?
[17:14:15] <bjsnider> this isn't type="checkbox"
[17:14:16] <duch_kazatel> what do you mean?
[17:14:42] <duch_kazatel> using $() ?
[17:16:01] <duch_kazatel> bjoe2k4
[17:16:03] <duch_kazatel> errr.
[17:16:04] <duch_kazatel> bjsnider
[17:16:27] <bjsnider> yeah
[17:16:33] <duch_kazatel> that's valid.
[17:16:37] <duch_kazatel> you can select multiple radios.
[17:16:59] <duch_kazatel> even if they have the same name.
[17:21:02] <bjsnider> because of $()?
[17:21:17] <duch_kazatel> newp.
[17:21:34] <bjsnider> why did you ask about that?
[17:21:50] <duch_kazatel> i was trying to get clarification about what was going on.
[17:22:15] <duch_kazatel> "why is fiddle allowing me to select  more than one radio button?" is ambiguous - how are you selecting elements?  it is something in jsfiddle or something else?
[17:22:16] <duch_kazatel> etc.
[17:24:24] <bjsnider> it's working as expected in the example
[17:24:31] <duch_kazatel> hrm?
[17:24:36] <duch_kazatel> what example?
[17:26:10] <bjsnider> https://api.jquery.com/checked-selector/
[17:26:34] <duch_kazatel> mind sharing the fiddle?
[17:29:58] <duch_kazatel> <duch_kazatel> what example?
[17:29:58] <duch_kazatel> [2016:12:19:14:26:1
[17:30:00] <duch_kazatel> woops.
[17:30:09] <duch_kazatel> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[17:30:44] <bjsnider> let me simplify the stupid thing first
[17:33:45] <bjsnider> https://jsfiddle.net/L8cx3ssh/
[17:34:05] <duch_kazatel> right.
[17:34:12] <duch_kazatel> notice how you're repeating the name?
[17:35:05] <bjsnider> the name of the button?
[17:35:14] <duch_kazatel> the name of the radios.
[17:35:37] <duch_kazatel> also: you want the change event.
[17:35:38] <duch_kazatel> one sec.
[17:35:53] <bjsnider> the names of the radios are different, a/b/c in this case
[17:36:09] <duch_kazatel> then you'll get more than one when nabbing the value.
[17:36:16] <duch_kazatel> the name is how they get grouped.
[17:39:06] <duch_kazatel> https://jsfiddle.net/L8cx3ssh/1/
[17:39:11] <duch_kazatel> this does what I think you're looking for.
[17:39:33] <bjsnider> duch_kazatel: thanks
[17:39:45] <duch_kazatel> which is what i was trying to tell you earlier.
[17:39:56] <duch_kazatel> see why i suggested that now?
[17:45:19] <bjsnider> i'll study it in a few minutes, currently eating
[17:45:29] <duch_kazatel> lol.  kay.
[17:50:23] <kof> Hai! anyone worked with similar 360 view like this https://sketchfab.com/models/2d79bf50a7c0463ab025e116326d5136
[17:50:55] <duch_kazatel> looks like webgl.
[17:51:02] <duch_kazatel> can't say i have.
[17:56:45] <taplar> today has been weirdly slow, yet its flown by
[18:02:49] <duch_kazatel> ^ that.
