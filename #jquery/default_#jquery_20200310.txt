[04:48:02] <nickNolte> hello, can anyone tell me why jquery is behaving the way it does here: https://jsfiddle.net/ampuhyLn/
[04:48:15] <nickNolte> selected jquery version is 3.3.1
[04:52:58] <Woet> nickNolte: behaving what way? giving you the values you requested?
[04:53:29] <Woet> nickNolte: what are you trying to do? what is the actual use-case?
[04:53:37] <nickNolte> Woet: i get output test and test2, although one is innerHTML and the other value
[04:53:48] <Woet> nickNolte: the value of select without a value is the text.
[04:54:08] <Woet> nickNolte: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/option
[04:54:14] <Woet> 'The content of this attribute represents the value to be submitted with the form, should this option be selected. If this attribute is omitted, the value is taken from the text content of the option element."
[04:54:32] <nickNolte> Woet: any method that returns undefined/null/empty string on option that has no value set?
[04:55:06] <Woet> nickNolte: https://api.jquery.com/attr/
[04:55:27] <nickNolte> Woet: ok thanks

[12:13:51] <laravelnewbzor> I'm trying to add an anchor to the location and redirect the user to it after triggering a submitHandler .. it works until i add an anchor to the location... i'm using $(window).attr('location', location); .. any suggestions?
[18:41:24] <Sal> hi, can someone suggest me a nice effect to apply to a span that contains a number and that jq changes every minute? the change is too fast and I'm afraid the user will miss it. That's why I would like to apply an animation on every change
[18:41:47] <robertmaxrees> check out ##design
[18:41:52] <Sal> I was trying slipeUp and SlideDown, but for some reason they're not working like i tought
[18:42:11] <Sal> its a jq animation i'm asking for
[18:42:25] <robertmaxrees> you're asing for design help :) alternatively, if you have code you'd like help with, share it in a jsfiddle and we can go form there.
[18:42:27] <robertmaxrees> *from
[18:43:04] <Sal> ok, never mind. I tried
[18:43:06] <Sal> bye
[18:43:09] <robertmaxrees> wat
[18:43:26] <robertmaxrees> welp
[18:51:58] <jak2000> hi all i have a div, with an Html Table) the user interact with it.... change select option, capture on input text, and so on... i save entire div html to database... but when extract the html, the values changed on the html, same as, select option, input texts, not saved, why? how to do this effect?
[18:52:17] <robertmaxrees> well
[18:52:57] <robertmaxrees> 2 things: 1 - if you're using .html(), you're not going to get the updated values. 2 - don't save the html itself to your db in the first place, save the name/value pairs as JSON instead.
[18:54:03] <jak2000> robertmaxrees yes i know html is big data, but by moment need save... and yes: 1 - if you're using .html(), you're not going to get the updated values    <--- hw to get? wich need call inplace of: .html()  ?
[18:54:15] <robertmaxrees> see my second point.
[18:54:26] <robertmaxrees> it's a PITA to save the "updated" html.
[18:58:09] <robertmaxrees> not to say it's not possible, but it's kind of a strange thing to do, hence why it's difficult :)
[19:05:20] <jak2000> ok, follow second advice
[19:05:21] <jak2000> thanks
[19:06:39] <robertmaxrees> :) there are some built-in methods that'll make that pretty easy.
[19:09:36] <jak2000> tell me, please my table contain 100 rows with 20 columns, have inputs selects checkboxes....
[19:10:02] <robertmaxrees> serialize or serializeArray
[19:10:53] <robertmaxrees> if everything is wrapped in a big form, it's even easier.
[19:11:32] <robertmaxrees> rather - serializeArray will give ytou the array you want.  serialize turns it into a url-friendly format.
[19:12:16] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/f9rdocxu/4/ for instance
[19:13:33] <jak2000> k, check thanks robertmaxrees!
[19:53:42] <jak2000> robertparkerx: https://jsfiddle.net/Lcjqp9av/   not display anything
[19:53:48] <jak2000> no console text too
