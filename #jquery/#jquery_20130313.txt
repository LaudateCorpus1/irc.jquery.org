[00:00:31] <Ortund> Max-P initially I'd thought of doing all the work in php before outputting it to the page. I thought I'd explode the whole code block into an array in the php and work on each line individually... but that didn't work... said the array didn't have an that it should have - as I understood it anyway
[00:01:43] <Max-P> What part doesn't work exactly?
[00:02:06] <Max-P> I see the provided CSS doesn't match neither the source or the expected output
[00:02:13] <Max-P> maybe that's the problem?
[00:02:47] <Ortund> you mean the css is wrong or the expected output is wrong to match the css?
[00:03:44] <Ortund> Credit where it's due... Cork contributed more to this yesterday than I did, but I do understand the concept being used here
[00:04:16] <Ortund> shit... just spotted, the css uses #weather-feed and the div is class="weather-feed"
[00:04:47] <Ortund> well there it is
[00:09:19] <Ortund> Can't believe I sat staring at this all night and it was just that... FML
[00:09:31] <Max-P> Ortund, Yes, that's exactly what I was pointing :P Those happens
[00:10:04] <guzzlefry> Does Firebug have a list of IDs and classes for that stuff?
[00:10:33] <Max-P> guzzlefry, what stuff?
[00:10:39] <guzzlefry> err
[00:10:59] <guzzlefry> Is there some features in Firebug that displays a list of classes/IDs on a given page?
[00:12:28] <Max-P> I know Chromium and latest versions of Firefox can show you directly what styles are being applied to which element, so you can see what rules are not applied so it's easier to troubleshoot
[00:12:49] <Max-P> But a complete list of it, I don't think so
[00:13:17] <macbleser_> Hey guys, I'm back for another fun question
[00:13:25] <guzzlefry> I'd prefer a list.  I tend to transpose letters in class names, or capitalize it in one part and not the other. :P
[00:13:29] <Max-P> Oooooh, it's macbleser_ again!
[00:13:50] <macbleser_> lol
[00:14:44] <Max-P> guzzlefry, yeah, I see. I do that all the time. I usually just inspect the element with the wrong styles, check where it was supposed to be applied or not, and end up seeing "Ok, so the browser doesn't apply the rule. *check the rule in the .css* problem found (or *check the CSS on the element, problem found)
[00:15:14] <Max-P> macbleser_, Go ahead with your question, I'll be pleased to answer again ;)
[00:15:28] <macbleser_> Thank you sir
[00:15:53] <macbleser_> So this is regarding the function being executed on scroll
[00:16:38] <Max-P> guzzlefry, The problem is, I dont see how such a list could be efficiently made, because of the differenc cases and naming things, both names would get so far from each-other in the list.
[00:16:56] <Max-P> macbleser_, Yup, what's wrong with it this time?
[00:17:14] <macbleser_> This may not be the right channel to ask this question, but have you ever dealt with how iOS safari handles on scroll events?
[00:17:41] <macbleser_> what sucks is that it fires after the window stops scrolling
[00:18:21] <Max-P> macbleser_, I think that's somehow normal, because iOS optimises the scroll so it's rock solid 60 FPS scrolling
[00:18:31] <Max-P> fireing JS events would make it stutter as hell
[00:18:57] <Max-P> In fact, the whole renderer and JS engine are both completely paused as long as it's scrolling.
[00:20:02] <macbleser_> Yeah true. Well basically the design spec is to make the fixed position at the top of the window once scrolled past a certain height.
[00:20:27] <Max-P> There's an HTML5 property that does the same, maybe that could help
[00:20:28] <macbleser_> Got it working perfectly on regular browsers thanks to your help earlier.
[00:20:40] <macbleser_> Oh really?
[00:21:06] <Max-P> macbleser_, http://updates.html5rocks.com/2012/08/Stick-your-landings-position-sticky-lands-in-WebKit
[00:22:06] <macbleser_> You just blew my mind
[00:23:27] <Max-P> macbleser_, I'm not sure if iOS does support it thought, it looks like it requires webkit, and a fairly recent version of it.
[00:23:34] <macbleser_> position: sticky sounds so sexual.
[00:24:17] <macbleser_> I just tested that page on iOS simulator 6.1 and it supported it
[00:24:38] <Max-P> better than nothing
[00:24:54] <Max-P> I think you can check the support in JS, and fallback to JS when the browser doesn't support it
[00:25:15] <guzzlefry> gah, can't get this JQuery UI Slider thing to move my tabs about. -_-
[00:25:48] <macbleser_> Yeah. I was also looking into the touchmove events you can hook into on iOS as a possible fallback
[00:28:47] <macbleser_> Will have to dig into that stuff tomorrow. Nap time now before the 9-5..
[00:29:00] <macbleser_> Thanks for your help guys. Take care.
[00:33:47] <bluesm> Is creating variable instead of calling two times  my_input.val()  make sense ?
[00:34:10] <tw2113> yes
[00:34:19] <tw2113> at least with selectors
[00:34:31] <tw2113> and if you know it'll be the same both times
[00:37:40] <bluesm>   tw2113:  What do you mean by "with selectors" ?
[00:37:53] <tw2113> $('#mydiv')
[00:38:08] <tw2113> assign the resulting object to a variable instead of calling that multiple times
[00:38:09] <bluesm> tw2113: How could be different ?
[00:38:22] <tw2113> much like your my_input.va()
[00:38:27] <tw2113> val*
[00:38:35] <Max-P> bluesm, QUerying a selector is much slower than just using a variable
[00:38:39] <tw2113> with my_input being a variable you stored the object in
[00:39:10] <tw2113> it's a low-level form of caching
[00:39:15] <tw2113> for the duration of your script
[00:39:17] <bluesm> Max-P: I know. But the question is.   If I have selector in variable already.
[00:39:38] <Max-P> Because jQuery have to pass the selector to Sizzle, which in turn might call document.getElementById or .querySelector, which will have the browser parse the CSS rule and traverse the whole DOM to find the requested element
[00:39:45] <tw2113> if it's already in a variable once, just re-use that
[00:39:52] <bluesm> Max-P: If really "get variable from object" is slower than "get variable from actual scope".
[00:40:06] <tw2113> ah
[00:40:20] <Max-P> do you mean, $(my_selector).val() or something?
[00:40:23] <tw2113> i sort of get what you're asking
[00:40:42] <Max-P> .val() is still slower, because it involves a function call
[00:40:45] <tw2113> input.val() vs $('#input').val()
[00:41:18] <Max-P> and .val() does some tests and computations depending if it's a textarea, standard input, and others
[00:42:21] <cheshair> Hi! I need to store two variables of mine in a json string and send them to a page as post data (AJAX). Here's a snippet: http://dpaste.com/1021426/ Any tips?
[00:43:11] <bluesm> Max-P: Ok. I get it. Thank you very much
[00:43:32] <Max-P> cheshair, Does the server need to receive JSON or regular post data?
[00:43:47] <Cork> ?.serialize @ cheshair
[00:43:48] <bot-t> cheshair, .serialize(): Encode a set of form elements as a string for submission. http://api.jquery.com/serialize/
[00:44:01] <Ortund> Max-P just noticed that regex to replace "\n" with "<br />" doesn't seem to work now...
[00:44:05] <cheshair> Max-P: i guess regular post data indeed
[00:44:25] <Cork> cheshair: data: $('#selector-0, #selector-1').serialize(),
[00:44:25] <cheshair> Max-P: i just used json but i was wrong
[00:44:33] <Cork> cheshair: or simply data: $('form').serialize(),
[00:44:36] <Ortund> src.html().match(/<\/b>([^<]*)<a/)[1].trim().replace("\n", "<br />");       <- this should replace all "\n" characters with "<br />" between the </b> and <a> tag
[00:44:45] <cheshair> Max-P Cork: thank you very very much!!
[00:45:03] <Max-P> cheshair, Just pass data: {var0: my_var0, var1: my_var1}. jQuery does it by itself directly if you pass an object
[00:45:14] <Ortund> strangely, it works the first time, but not for subsequent occurrances
[00:45:29] <Max-P> Just for reference, if you really end up needing json, theres JSON.stringify() too, that spits out JSON that can be posted directly.
[00:45:40] <Cork> Ortund: are you sure you still have the line breaks in the html?
[00:45:55] <cheshair> Max-P: super! thanks again
[00:45:57] <Max-P> I use that personally, because it allows me to keep the full data structure on the server-side, with numbers being ints, floats being floats, objects being objects
[00:46:06] <Cork> cheshair: btw you can't have - in a variable name
[00:46:30] <Ortund> Cork, my guess is the 5 day forecast doesn't use line breaks... looks like it uses spaces
[00:46:53] <Max-P> Ortund, If it only replaces one, you might need to add the multi flag in the regex
[00:46:53] <Ortund> so this is far as I've got with that -> .match(/[0-9] [a-zA-Z]{3} /)[1].trim().replace(" ", "<br />");
[00:47:01] <Cork> Ortund: so your example wasn't accurate to the real thing...
[00:47:29] <Ortund> Cork, it was when I was just using the feed from yahoo weather that gave a 2 day forecast
[00:47:37] <Cork> ah
[00:47:38] <Ortund> which is what I started with yesterday
[00:47:53] <Cork> do you have the raw html somewhere?
[00:48:26] <cheshair> Cork: ah i see. anyway that was just a snippet i made up purging all my local details. nice to know, i won't use dashes in the real snippet
[00:49:25] <Cork> cheshair: ya, i figured that from the code, just thought it was good to pointout so you don't make that mistake again
[00:49:46] <Ortund> Cork, I just logged it to console and I found something painful... it does have the <br /> characters between the lines for each day's forecast, but I'm removing them all at the start :/
[00:50:07] <Cork> Orphis: ya, was affraid of that
[00:50:26] <Cork> Ortund: was thinking of removing that part from your code
[00:50:32] <Cork> should prob have done that >_>
[00:50:43] <Ortund> it breaks the regex tho
[00:50:46] <Cork> Ortund: could you make a new testcase?
[00:50:47] <Ortund> to remove that
[00:50:56] <Cork> ya, the regex would have to be modified
[00:54:36] <Ortund> Cork, new test case (this is the latest code) -> http://jsfiddle.net/qaLk3/
[00:56:00] <Max-P> Well, goodnight everyone
[00:57:01] <Ortund> cya Max-P
[00:57:18] <Ortund> Cork, I wish I could understand exactly what the regex is doing...
[00:58:03] <Cork> Ortund: uh, you wrote most of them...
[01:00:07] <Ortund> result += src.html().match(/<\/b>([^<]*)<b>/)[1].trim();           <<< I didn't write that...
[01:00:37] <Ortund> but unless I'm mistaken that's matching everything between </b> and <b> except <
[01:00:54] <Trisox> Cork: 0/
[01:10:32] <Cork> Ortund: http://jsfiddle.net/qaLk3/1/
[01:10:42] <Cork> you will have to give up on not using the labels for targeting though
[01:11:22] <Cork> and honestly, you shouldn't have removed them last time either, the regex becomes very fragile without it
[01:12:04] <Cork> whats left is to remove the railing two <br>'s in the matches
[01:12:42] <nocturne7> datatables plugin is horrible
[01:12:47] <nocturne7> it's a nightmare
[01:14:13] <Ortund> Cork, by labels, do you mean like the "weather conditions" and "forecast" text?
[01:14:20] <Cork> yes
[01:25:20] <granden_> Hi, I'm using bigVideo.JS that uses video.js in the background. And I noticed video.js got an api event that is, loadstart. How would I add an event listener for that?
[01:25:42] <k_sze[work]> How do I tell what jQuery event handler has been assigned to a form input element
[01:26:19] <k_sze[work]> e.g. if somewhere in my scripts, I have $('#username').focus(function(){this.select()})
[01:26:37] <k_sze[work]> How do I tell afterwards that the #username input box has that event handler?
[01:28:54] <Ortund> Cork, what is it about those regex that breaks them when the <br> tags are there?
[01:29:20] <Cork> Obvious: the old broke cause it searches until it found a <
[01:29:34] <Cork> [^<]* means match anything until you find a <
[01:30:54] <granden_> " $(window).on('play', function(){
[01:30:54] <granden_> 			       $('#loader').hide();
[01:30:56] <granden_> woops
[01:30:57] <granden_> sorry
[01:31:59] <Ortund> Cork, made allowance for the <br> -> lookie <\/b><br>([^<]*)<b>
[01:32:23] <Ortund> that'll ignore the 2 trailing <br> tags before the next <b> too
[01:32:58] <Cork> Ortund: that just allos a br after the <\/br>
[01:33:03] <Cork> *<\/b>
[01:33:09] <Cork> not sure how that will help
[01:33:30] <Cork> and the selector is still fragile
[01:33:46] <Cork> if they do the slightest change on there end you page will generate junk
[01:33:55] <Cork> instead of just not generating the data
[01:34:38] <Ortund> this better? -> Current Conditions:<\/b><br>([^<]*)<b>
[01:34:59] <air_> why do you use regexp to begin with?
[01:35:10] <Cork> air_: no element to select
[01:35:20] <Cork> Ortund: ya, it is
[01:35:25] <Ortund> air_: http://jsfiddle.net/qaLk3/1/
[01:35:45] <air_> ah, ok. I'll have a peek.
[01:36:10] <Ortund> okay so Cork, I can leave that regex as is there, and technically should be able to modify the forecast one to match everything including the <br> tags... in theory
[01:36:41] <Ortund> Just to preserve the <br>s so I don't end up with 5 days worth of forecasts all on 1 line
[01:36:43] <Cork> Ortund: ya, but i think it would be better to have stronger selectors
[01:36:45] <Cork> but its up to you
[01:37:09] <Ortund> how would I make the selectors stronger than "Current Conditions:<\/b><br>([^<]*)<b>"?
[01:37:11] <Cork> Ortund: you could split it on <br> afterwards if you like
[01:37:29] <Cork> and then read the br for those matches you want
[01:38:01] <Cork> Ortund: by stronger i mean to write it in a way where an extra br in there won't break your code
[01:38:45] <Cork> and that was what i did before, but its up to you how much you want to keep updating it to make sure it works
[01:39:24] <Cork> Ortund: just to be a bit clearer, specific = make sure it only match one area you want
[01:39:46] <Cork> stronger = make sure it doesn't break on changes you can foresee
[01:40:47] <Ortund> that's what you did before? you mean the latest fiddle that I linked to air_ ?
[01:41:03] <Cork> yes
[01:41:18] <Cork> it will match anything between CurrentConditions: and <b>
[01:41:45] <Cork> and with how the page is constructed, that should always be true until they reorder things
[01:41:46] <air_> in this case, I'd rather rely on the texts than on the amount of <b>'s and <br>'s.
[01:41:50] <Cork> and even then it should work
[01:42:07] <Cork> ah, good point
[01:42:18] <air_> If "current condition" and "forecast" are always static, you'd find the rest of the information without trouble.
[01:42:24] <Cork> it should be Forcast: not <b>
[01:42:26] <air_> and if they are not there, you should bailout.
[01:42:53] <Ortund> actually sounds like a better idea there air_
[01:42:53] <Cork> the tricky part is to find the end of Forcast
[01:43:04] <Cork> but the domain name should be safe enough
[01:43:32] <Ortund> not so tricky actually Cork, since the end of Forecast is the end of the code
[01:43:38] <air_> Cork: split text into array on <br>, match against the known names for days.
[01:43:44] <Ortund> so there's nothing to look at in the div after that
[01:43:52] <Cork> Ortund: make sure you don't include the <b> in the match though
[01:44:05] <maskio> anyone can help me with jqgrid?
[01:44:21] <Cork> Ortund: no you want to stop the match at the forcast link
[01:44:23] <Ortund> Cork, so Current Conditions:<\/b>((.|[\r\n])*)<b> becomes Current Conditions:((.|[\r\n])*) ?
[01:44:30] <Cork> Ortund: at least thats what the code does
[01:44:38] <Cork> Ortund: no
[01:44:54] <Cork> Current Conditions:<\/b>((.|[\r\n])*)<b>Forcast
[01:45:09] <Cork> or possibly Current Conditions:<\/b>((.|[\r\n])*)<b>Forcast:
[01:45:17] <xybrek> is there a plugin for jquery to render json data into product list (grid box style)
[01:45:23] <Ortund> ah almost had it
[01:45:43] <Cork> Ortund: simply just add Forcast: at the end of the old selector
[01:45:57] <Cork> s/selector/regex/
[01:49:36] <Ortund> Cork, as far as finding the end of Forecast goes... I was thinking of selecing on <br><a ... there's no other occurance of it anywhere else and I don't think that's likely to change
[01:50:41] <Ortund> although probably best to end it on the start of the url there
[01:51:53] <Ortund> then again, this is the most work I've ever done with regex so still thinking about it like a noob probably
[01:55:30] <Nebros> good morning, i have there a little question... ^^ is ajax an addon of jquery?
[01:55:50] <Cork> no
[01:55:55] <Nebros> or is it similar based but not of jquery?
[01:56:29] <Nebros> what is it?
[01:56:49] <Cork> ajax is a central core feature in jquery
[01:56:58] <Cork> if you mean $.ajax that is
[01:57:19] <Cork> if you mean the term ajax no, then its just a term for "dynamically changing the page with javascript"
[01:58:23] <Nebros> i mean $.ajax
[01:59:47] <Nebros> it is a part of jquery if i understood you right?
[02:00:14] <Cork> yes, its not a separate lib you can split out
[02:00:30] <Nebros> ok, thank you for this answer. :)
[02:10:19] <alex88> hi guys, http://pastie.org/private/h9q34znrcgllipvmv1icq I've this code which is triggered from some buttons.click() since the parameters change for each button, the problem is that when I click a button per time it works, when I click them one right after the other an ajax call is cancelled browser side
[02:10:42] <alex88> what could be wrong?
[02:17:45] <mrHat> ok, so i have a navigation tree build with an unordered list (<ul><li>) i want on a certain node to display a path with all parents of that node such as a breadcrumb for example: <ul><li>ROOT<ul><li>LEAF (ROOT>LEAF)</li></ul></li></ul>
[02:20:16] <Mento> Hey guys, i'm trying to add paging to a table. it basically works the way i want it, but its not dynamic. I need to handle more columns, any suggestions? http://jsfiddle.net/ZKvzz/1/
[02:26:23] <seutje> Mento: http://jsfiddle.net/ZKvzz/2/
[02:26:47] <seutje> should prolly make it into something u can instance though
[02:32:02] <Mento> seutje - thanks, makes sense
[02:57:47] <Draeli> If I remember, jQuery add an internal index for each element of DOM, do you remember the name of this index in the jQuery source ?
[02:59:14] <Cork> Draeli: internal index?
[02:59:23] <Cork> you mean the attribute?
[02:59:58] <maskio> hi! can anyone help me with jqgrid?
[03:00:13] <Cork> ?.expando @ Draeli
[03:00:25] <bot-t1> Cork, Couldn't find ".expando" in jQuery Docs.
[03:00:40] <Cork> bot-t1: you didn't look hard enough, look again!
[03:00:41] <bot-t1> Cork, Very doubtful.
[03:00:51] <Draeli> Cork: not the id attribute, an index (or if you prefer a number) who is internal to jquery box
[03:01:23] <Cork> Draeli: i meant the jquery[random number]= attribute
[03:01:38] <Cork> that jquery uses to identify elements
[03:01:51] <Cork> with its $.expando++ variable
[03:04:29] <Cork> ?ask @ maskio

[03:09:35] <Draeli> Cork: yes it look like what I search but in this case I think I can't use. I was thinking to detect if DOM change by looking this number and if is increment then I know DOM is change. In this case, maybe have you an idea to do this ?
[03:10:28] <Cork> Draeli: what browsers do you need to support?
[03:10:55] <Draeli> Cork: I was thinking too to overload method who can add element to trigger a new event "add" but I don't know how do to this correctly
[03:11:03] <Draeli> Cork: all browsers
[03:11:31] <Cork> Draeli: then ya i would use a wrapper function and just have it use .html()
[03:11:39] <Cork> and when its done call a callback or similar
[03:14:21] <Draeli> Cork: I was thinking too about this approch but in my case, I want support other plugin without modification, then if a third plugin add some element, I want my plugin (or other part of code) can have an information "Hey boy, your DOM change :)"
[03:16:23] <Cork> (function($) { var html = $.fn.html; $.fn.html = function() { var result = html.apply(this, arguments); /* call calbacks */; return result; }; })(jQuery);
[03:16:27] <Cork> Draeli: ^
[03:16:58] <Cork> as long as no plugin saves there own reference to $.fn.html that should work
[03:17:13] <sirAntonio> hi guys got a little problem here
[03:17:36] <DarsVaeda> in one function I have a ajax request with the answer I populate the dom in another function I need an .on('click',...) on populated elements, but elements are not there when I call .on() how is such a case handled now .live is deprecated?
[03:17:46] <sirAntonio> im trying to write a function to handle the submiting of forms with a specific class
[03:18:01] <sirAntonio> so far havent accomplished anything
[03:18:11] <Cork> DarsVaeda: use delegate or on's delegate syntax
[03:18:31] <Cork> DarsVaeda: thats why live has been deprecated, theres been a much better way to do the same thing for a long time
[03:18:49] <DarsVaeda> okay thanks I'll read up

[03:19:09] <Draeli> Cork: yes, I like your idea of code, but in this case, if I continu in your idea, I must too do this for append and other who are not using html() (I not remember totally the source of jquery but if I remember a little, there is 4 way to load new element in jquery). Do you confirm ?
[03:19:46] <sirAntonio> if i  use $('form.classname').submit() it doesnt work .. is there something im doing wrong
[03:19:48] <Cork> Draeli: html, remove(), prepend, append, empty(), ...
[03:20:07] <Cork> sirAntonio: does the element exist when you run that line?
[03:20:21] <sirAntonio> yes
[03:20:37] <Cork> and you're trying to trigger the submit?
[03:20:41] <sirAntonio> but i have several forms
[03:21:05] <Cork> and you're trying to trigger the submit? <--
[03:21:29] <sirAntonio> nope .. i want to handle the submit via ajax
[03:21:33] <cods> Is there a shorter way to write: $(".foo").map(function(){return $(this).data("bar");}) ? (to get an array of the "bar" data of all the element retrieved by $(".foo"))
[03:21:54] <Cork> sirAntonio: so $('form.classname').submit(function() {  });
[03:22:08] <sirAntonio> yes
[03:22:22] <Cork> cods: that won't give you an array of data
[03:22:34] <Cork> codelahoma: $().map will give you a jquery wrapped selection
[03:22:54] <Draeli> Cork: I have too a last approch who can work in all case (native too) but look like really heavy, the idea is to calculate the length of $('html').html() (or innerHTML in case of native) and too avoid false positive, to add md5 signature but I think if it can work, may be there is a less fat way to do this. What you think about this idea ?
[03:23:17] <Cork> cods: you want $.map($('.foo'), function(elm) { return $(elm).data('bar'); })
[03:23:27] <Cork> cods: and no thats the shortest you can get
[03:23:36] <sirAntonio> it then tries just submits the data normaly even though im currently preventing the default action
[03:24:21] <Cork> Draeli: honestly?, it sounds horrible
[03:24:56] <Draeli> Cork: for me too it sounds horrible ^^
[03:25:33] <Cork> Draeli: there is a way to do it really well in modern browsers (chrome and firefox), but the problem is how to solve it in the other
[03:25:47] <Cork> ?mdc mutationobserver @ Draeli
[03:25:53] <bot-t1> Draeli, MutationObserver - Document Object Model (DOM) | MDN - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/MutationObserver
[03:26:04] <Cork> but as its not cross browser, its normally not really a solution
[03:26:12] <Draeli> Cork: two days I do search to do this by jquery or in native and I see only this for native and in case of jquery i'm not totally convinced by overload method
[03:26:22] <Draeli> Cork: I was looking about mutation too
[03:27:16] <Draeli> Cork: but in this case, if I saw way to support in all browsers, my problem is this method is suppose to work only in new attribute and not new dom element
[03:27:32] <Cork> when ie supports it it will be really nice, cause (opera has thrown in the towel)
[03:27:40] <Draeli> Cork: (or I miss the way to do this directly)
[03:27:55] <Cork> Draeli: ya, i agree, and i fully agree that its not a solution
[03:27:56] <djQuery> ?newcontent@draeli
[03:27:57] <bot-t1> draeli, jQuery.newContent is a plugin that helps maintain a set of callbacks for elements as they are added. Bind a callback with $( selector ).newContent( function ) and execute the bound callbacks by calling .newContent() on any new content you are adding to the DOM - https://gist.github.com/1003630
[03:27:59] <Draeli> Cork: If i remember, ie support by .change method
[03:28:08] <djQuery> did I not send that to you the other day?
[03:28:49] <cods> Cork: thanks!
[03:28:57] <Cork> djQuery: didn't that depend on the user calling it?
[03:29:05] <Draeli> djQuery: yes you send me this yesterday but it's not exactly what I search (saw my answer yesterday or my conversation here with Cork)
[03:29:10] <Cork> to notify the other that it did ad new content?
[03:29:22] <djQuery> Cork, only the user knowing what is being added
[03:29:37] <Cork> djQuery: thats the problem here
[03:29:44] <Cork> thats third party code
[03:31:05] <Draeli> finally I suppose i'm going to apply the overload solution of Cork or my really heavy solution but in this two case, for me look like not a true solution (at less it's solution^^).
[03:31:44] <Cork> Draeli: i would stay away from the serialize solution, it would fast be a performance nightmare
[03:33:00] <Draeli> Cork:  "a performance nightmare" I think the same but only by intellectual curiosity, I'm going to do a benchmark about this, may be by miracle it's not so heavy ^^
[03:33:00] <Cork> Draeli: btw, why do you need to know if a plugin has changed the page?
[03:33:25] <Draeli> Cork: in the idea yes it's the idea
[03:33:39] <Cork> Draeli: the nightmare is that you can't really benchmark it, cause as the page change it will change from nothing to A LOT
[03:33:55] <Cork> Draeli: WHY? ;)
[03:34:22] <Cork> there might be other ways to handle it where you don't have to actively look for it
[03:35:35] <sirAntonio> i think i have it
[03:36:07] <Draeli> Cork: the idea is, I want my colleagues to there own plugin or piece of code directly and a common listener is disponible in document to call all dependancy
[03:36:28] <sirAntonio> ok if the division and form i am linking to is loaded asyncronously
[03:36:51] <sirAntonio> then this means that jq may not bind to that selector right
[03:37:07] <Cork> Draeli: sounds like newContent is the best way honesty
[03:37:19] <Cork> Draeli: cause then you really do have control of what does the changes
[03:38:26] <Cork> Draeli: if you made a plugin that for some reason need to keep track of something on the site it was loaded on (not your site) then it MIGHT have made sense
[03:38:29] <Draeli> Cork: I was thinking but in really not for all (at least for plugin my colleagues don't create)
[03:38:43] <Cork> but if its all for code developed in house, not really
[03:39:13] <Cork> Draeli: its almost always doable
[03:39:50] <Cork> especially of the one that includes the plugin tends to checking when the plugin changes the dom and just adds listeners for when that happens
[03:40:54] <Draeli> Cork: at least in your overload, I think I'm in the good way, the only "problem" it's on not native method but in this case I see only heavy solution (but I suppose a geniouse is with and idea ^^)
[03:41:00] <sirAntonio> is there a way to know get the form i'm submiting currently ? i have an array of forms
[03:41:13] <sirAntonio> with the same class
[03:41:59] <Cork> sirAntonio: try rephrase that question, it doesn't parse
[03:42:47] <Cork> you want to know what form did the submit event your currently handling?
[03:45:13] <Bheam> yo
[03:45:28] <Bheam> i'm having a problem that $() runs before images are loaded, what can i do?
[03:46:06] <Cork> $(document).on('load', function() {}) instead of $(function() {}) or $(document).ready(function() {})
[03:46:09] <ravenzz> load?
[03:47:10] <cheshair> Hi! I need to send some data via AJAX to a page of mine. What's the difference between myvar.serialize() and $.toJSON(myvar) ?
[03:47:46] <Cork> cheshair: the first will give you a string of the values of the fields
[03:48:01] <Cork> cheshair: the sendon will give you a string of stringified html objects
[03:48:08] <Cork> *the second
[03:48:56] <sirAntonio> ok Cork: i have an like 3 forms with the same class and im using a  $('form.classgiven').submit() to handle the forms when submitted ..what id like is that when this is sumbitted id like to disable that form is there a way to do that ?
[03:49:25] <Cork> cheshair: key1=val&key2=val2 vs ["[object HTMLInput]","[object HTMLInput]","[object HTMLInput]","[object HTMLInput]"]
[03:49:45] <cheshair> Cork: thanks! that's really a complete explanation!!!
[03:49:54] <Cork> sirAntonio: $(this)
[03:50:05] <Hasoth> is anyone familiar with http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/camera-slideshow ? I'm trying to change font type for something inside post when current slider will appear... but I don't know If it's possible to do that from "html effects place"
[03:50:07] <Cork> or if you want the pure dom element just this
[03:50:21] <sirAntonio> this can work ..leme try  that
[03:53:37] <sirAntonio> haha .. i'm a toast hehe had forgotten to comment on a block
[03:54:02] <sirAntonio> thanks Cork:
[03:54:09] <Cork> np
[03:58:26] <fgro> hi is there an irc channel for backbone.js?
[04:01:23] <Draeli> fgro: you look /list ?
[04:03:10] <johnkpaul> fgro: yes, #documentcloud
[04:03:18] <johnkpaul> that's the backbone channel
[04:10:01] <deepy> I'm trying to figure out what's going wrong, can I somehow console.log() in my callback function for the AJAX request?
[04:10:13] <deepy> I've tried console.log() but it doesn't log anything to console :p
[04:12:44] <DraeliYvesAstier> deepy: do you try to console in "complete" method ? (http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/)
[04:13:35] <deepy> complete doesn't have the arguments passed to my callback. no?
[04:21:15] <djQuery> wth?   why does the on click on fire twice? http://jsfiddle.net/djquery/kAUpv/
[04:21:50] <djQuery> check then uncheck then check again the checkbox in the header and you will see what I am talking about
[04:23:19] <Cork> djQuery: uh... its prop('checked', true) not 'checked'
[04:23:32] <Cork> and its checked, false) not removeProp
[04:23:34] <djQuery> Cork, have tried it both ways
[04:23:41] <Cork> its attr that does it that way
[04:23:58] <bahamas> hi. I'm using the jqueryui tabs functionality. I have two tabs and even though the second one is set as active, the first one is displayed for a moment when the page loads. how can I have the right tab displayed from the start?
[04:24:06] <Cork> djQuery: didn't mean it causes the dubble click event
[04:24:20] <Cork> just that its not meant to be used like that
[04:25:52] <Cork> djQuery: works fine here http://jsfiddle.net/kAUpv/1/
[04:30:05] <bahamas> so, anyone have any idea?
[04:46:09] <bahamas> can I somehow change the dom before it's displayed?
[04:47:51] <dmpython> Hola, ¿alguien habla español?
[04:48:05] <dmpython> Tengo problemas con ajax y unicode
[04:51:17] <DraeliYvesAstier> dmpython: puedo ayudar te
[04:53:26] <DraeliYvesAstier> dmpython: (pero voy a comer en ningun momento lo que podria tener la respuesta despues^^)
[04:54:11] <dmpython> DraeliYvesAstier, gracias
[04:54:20] <dmpython> tengo una consulta que devuelve un json
[04:54:36] <dmpython> y no funciona cuando el json incorpora caracteres extendidos
[04:54:51] <dmpython> "ñ"  por ejemplo
[04:55:55] <dmpython> estoy peleando con autocomplete
[04:56:16] <dmpython> uso $.ajax ¿debería usar getJSON?
[04:56:27] <DraeliYvesAstier> dmpython: ¿Estás seguro de que el envío y recepción de archivos están registradas con la codificación utf8 sin bom?
[04:57:21] <dmpython> ¿sin boom?
[04:57:52] <joelbirch> dmpython: ¿asegúrese de que sirven de todo, como UTF-8?
[04:58:23] <DraeliYvesAstier> dmpython: Además, debe ser que el "script" que está enviando la respuesta con un 'header' que especifica utf8
[04:59:49] <dmpython> DraeliYvesAstier, un momento debe haber otra cosa, porque probé otra cosa que también tiene unicode y me lo mostró bien
[05:00:07] <dmpython> tal vez halla algo en el json que lo haga inválido
[05:00:24] <dmpython> DraeliYvesAstier, Gracias por ahora, puedes ir a comer tranquilo :)
[05:01:07] <deepy> Can anyone explain to me why this is happening?
[05:01:10] <deepy> http://jsbin.com/ijolef/2/
[05:01:23] <deepy> it's one line of code in a for loop
[05:02:05] <deepy> why does the end result have <option></option> between every option?
[05:02:22] <joelbirch> deepy: can we see the for loop?
[05:02:43] <deepy> Did you hide the javascript tab?
[05:02:59] <joelbirch> deepy: Ah, fail. ta.
[05:03:48] <joelbirch> deepy: use $.each(arr, function…)
[05:04:11] <deepy> fair point, but why is this happening?
[05:04:20] <joelbirch> "for…in" will include prototype properties that arrays have
[05:04:27] <deepy> Oh.
[05:07:08] <deepy> joelbirch: I'm seeing the humour http://jsbin.com/ijolef/4/
[05:07:14] <Cork> deepy: or you can use for(var i = 0, length = arr.length; i<length;i++) {} or arr.hasOwnProperty
[05:07:41] <deepy> Cork: I did that previously, I had the exact same results
[05:07:54] <Cork> it shouldn't
[05:08:09] <Cork> length doesn't include prototype
[05:08:21] <joelbirch> deepy: I don't suppose you could use an object instead of an array, could you? Probably not, I know.
[05:09:02] <deepy> Cork: http://jsbin.com/ijolef/5/edit
[05:09:09] <joelbirch> deepy: .hasOwnProperty really should solve it :/
[05:09:24] <Cork> so should length
[05:09:29] <Cork> ah
[05:09:47] <Cork> deepy: s/<option>/<\/option>/
[05:09:58] <Cork> that should solve the problem :)
[05:10:02] <deepy> Ah!
[05:10:18] <deepy> I had gone insane over this
[05:10:24] <Cork> lol
[05:10:37] <Cork> i would go with the for(var i=0, length solution
[05:10:46] <Cork> that way you don't have to create the extra scope
[05:10:53] <joelbirch> oh yeah, closing tags, doh
[05:11:02] <Cork> (normally a minor thing, but anyway)
[05:11:22] <deepy> Good thing the browser was helpful and added the </option>
[05:11:45] <Cork> well thats html for you
[05:11:58] <Cork> deepy: you could always use xhtml :)
[05:12:14] <Cork> doesn't work in ie9 though >_>
[05:12:55] <deepy> xhtml?
[05:13:05] <Cork> its as strict as xml
[05:13:07] <deepy> I thought they /fixed/ that with IE9
[05:13:25] <Cork> only partially
[05:13:36] <Cork> ie9 can handle the content-type
[05:13:39] <deepy> It accepts it if you serve it as HTML instead of using the proper mime-type?
[05:13:41] <Cork> but it doesn't handle it correct
[05:13:45] <deepy> oh
[05:14:08] <Cork> ya, with another mimetype it works fine
[05:14:17] <Cork> as then its just html anyway
[05:15:14] <bahamas> I'll try again. anyone have any idea how I can have the right tab display by default with jqueryui? right now, it displays a tab for a fraction of a second and then switches to the tab marked as active
[05:20:29] <Cork> bahamas: how are you switching it there how?
[05:21:04] <Cork> *there now
[05:23:26] <Clex> bahamas: set your HTML properly instead of running JavaScript to initialize things.
[05:24:43] <keirlav87> is it possible to set a stacking order to draggable elements?
[05:25:00] <sirAntonio> need some lil help
[05:25:02] <keirlav87> of course there is - the stack option :p
[05:26:21] <Clex> ?ask @ sirAntonio
[05:26:21] <b-ot> sirAntonio: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[05:26:22] <bot-t> sirAntonio, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[05:27:49] <keirlav87> actually the stack option always brings the currently dragged element to the front - is there a way to set a priority so that this is not always the case?
[05:27:57] <sirAntonio> sorry bout that can someone help me figure out whats wrong with this http://jsbin.com/areqov/1
[05:28:48] <sirAntonio> on the the when i try executing that i get some wierd response
[05:29:02] <sirAntonio> which looks like a code snippet
[05:29:14] <sirAntonio> brb with the paste
[05:30:28] <sirAntonio> actually it gives this function (){return b.param(this.serializeArray())}
[05:36:48] <sirAntonio> found the problem ..thanks .. instead of using serialize() i used serialize ..lol
[05:37:56] <roel_> jQuery UI 1.10 has removed the zIndex and stack option of the dialog. How can I force the jQuery UI dialog on top of everything else? Because at this point jQuery UI only looks at it's own elements! Anybody got an idea?
[05:38:51] <keirlav87> have you manually applied a high z-index css property to the element/
[05:41:37] <Tak0r|Work> someone know's how i can disable the modify prevention of a datepicker with preloaded values?
[05:44:21] <brajesh> hi
[05:44:26] <bahamas> Cork: I'm just setting 'active' to the index of the tab that I want to be active
[05:44:46] <brajesh> i have two jquery ui dialog on one page
[05:44:57] <anew> does anyone know a good jquery facebook content locker ?
[05:45:00] <anew> that is free ...
[05:45:03] <anew> all the ones i find are paid
[05:45:28] <brajesh> but when second gets opened . after closing it does not reinitilize itself
[05:46:01] <bahamas> Clex: that would mean messing with the HTML that jqueryui is using. is that the right thing to do?
[05:47:29] <brajesh> another time the popup is opened there's an javascript error "object has no method dialog"
[05:49:19] <Cork> bahamas: $().tabs({ active: 1 }) you mean?
[05:49:28] <bahamas> Cork: correct
[05:49:43] <Cork> that kinda sucks...
[05:49:59] <bahamas> Cork: why's that?
[05:50:15] <Cork> bahamas: i would expect active to set that tab as active before it renders it
[05:50:46] <bahamas> and better yet, what's the better solution?
[05:50:47] <Cork> bahamas: there most likely are a way around it, but i don't know it
[05:51:12] <Cork> but if you can reproduce that in a clean small testcase, i would call that a bug
[05:51:24] <bahamas> Cork: hm, let me see
[05:54:01] <roel_> yes keirlav87 but then the modal isn't moved to one z-index below the highest z-index
[05:54:51] <roel_> and when you have more than one dialog than you won't be able to know what modal is linked with the dialog that you want to move to the top!
[06:00:32] <bahamas> Cork: basically this is it, but this doesn't display the issue http://jsfiddle.net/DTGJs/. the difference is that I'm using a script tag inside the body (I don't know if it's relevant or not).
[06:02:33] <theFisher86> Hello all, I'
[06:03:51] <theFisher86> I'm brand new to jQuery... trying to make a splash page that fades in a background div and basically rotates through the hue one time... similar to the CSS animation hue-rotate: 360deg;  Not quite sure how to go about that though...
[06:04:07] <theFisher86> I've got my div fading in, just don't know how to get it to change the hue of the background image
[06:04:16] <theFisher86> see dev.aevuswatches.com/splash
[06:07:38] <Kottizen> Hi everyone. Let's say I have five <img>s, all with the same class. I have bound something to its click event, so that I can do something when a user clicks on an image, that has that specific class. Now, if I via ajax add another image, that's not clickable, presumably because I haven't bound it to the click function. How can I "update" the binding so that it catches all newly created <img>s with the same class as well, and not only those that 
[06:08:06] <djQuery> ?on@kottizen
[06:08:07] <bot-t> kottizen, .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements, including delegation and live binding. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[06:08:24] <boytoy_> anybody know of a slider a la http://jsbin.com/ucasoz/2/edit where i can style the line on each side of the dot individually?
[06:08:25] <Kottizen> djQuery: Lovely, thank you!
[06:09:30] <benjick> Hi. I'm using a plugin (ddSlick) that inserts <input type="hidden"> based on a what i choose in a list. I can see the inputs in the DOM but when I click on the submit button I can't see the values in $_POST (php). Do I have to do something before I submit the form?
[06:10:15] <djQuery> benjick, well its putting it in the dom but is it adding it to the form?
[06:10:39] <benjick> How do you mean? the inputs appear inside the <form>
[06:11:07] <benjick> http://dev.abstracta.se/timeline/bootstrap/admin/ if you want to see it
[06:12:51] <benjick> djQuery: And if you click submit the _POST is outputed
[06:14:30] <djQuery> benjick, have you tried looking at the dev tools to see what is submitted
[06:15:43] <benjick> Oh, I never used something like that, do I need to download anything? I'm using chrome
[06:16:17] <bahamas> benjick: your input doesn't have an id or name
[06:16:23] <bahamas> input field I mean
[06:16:23] <dorgan> is there a way to negate :empty?
[06:16:57] <bahamas> benjick: you can use chrome inspector for the stuff that djQuery suggested. right click > Inspect Element
[06:17:37] <benjick> oh, i see
[06:17:40] <benjick> damn, i'm stupid
[06:17:45] <benjick> thank you bahamas and djQuery
[06:18:35] <bahamas> you're welcome
[06:18:56] <benjick> It's like HTML 101 and i missed it
[06:21:59] <djQuery> benjick, it is adding the inputs but it is not giving them a name hence they are not included in the submit
[06:37:25] <noregret> is still target="_blank" used for anchors? or is there a better way for that ?
[06:39:16] <djQuery> noregret, to get them to open in a new window? not realy
[06:39:25] <noregret> djQuery: yeah
[06:39:33] <noregret> ok then
[06:40:40] <djQuery> dorgan, :not(:empty)
[06:40:57] <djQuery> dorgan, most likely slow as heck
[06:41:04] <pachet> ^
[06:45:08] <anew> is uploading an image with ajax, as simple as just getting the val() of the input field ?
[06:45:46] <pachet> nope
[06:46:27] <anew> damn this looks ... complicated
[06:46:31] <anew> so if i am using a form to upload data
[06:46:34] <anew> and an image is part of that form
[06:46:38] <anew> is there a simpler alternative i can do
[06:46:59] <pachet> simpler than what? uploading the image via ajax?
[06:47:03] <pachet> sure, just submit the form :[
[06:47:13] <anew> argh
[06:47:28] <anew> so then i'd have to tear apart all my ajax wouldnt i
[06:48:22] <pachet> no idea, i havent seen your code
[06:48:26] <pachet> that sounds a bit extreme
[06:49:31] <anew> i guess my question is...
[06:49:45] <anew> can i keep the ajax i have to submit the data... and submit the image another (easier) way
[06:49:46] <djQuery> ?ajaxform
[06:49:46] <bot-t> ajaxForm plugin - Full AJAX form support, including file upload capabilities. The primary methods for managing your form are ajaxForm and ajaxSubmit. - http://jquery.malsup.com/form/#download
[06:50:00] <seutje> noregret: I've used stuff like $('body').on('click', 'a[href^="http"]', function(e) { e.preventDefault(); window.open(e.target.href); }); in the past
[06:50:24] <seutje> noregret: catches all links that start with "http" and opens them in a new window
[06:55:46] <fulld> for debugging, can I see a list of actions attached to a button onClick or a form onSubmit?
[06:57:56] <seutje> fulld: for jQuery events, use $el._data('events')
[06:58:13] <seutje> fulld: for arbitrary events, use Chrome devtools
[06:58:25] <seutje> or @see ?g visualevent
[06:58:27] <bot-t> seutje, Allan Jardine | Reflections | Visual Event - http://www.sprymedia.co.uk/article/Visual+Event
[07:00:16] <fulld> very nice, thank you
[07:11:18] <myosotis> can I serialize html inputs that are not contained in a <form> ?
[07:12:57] <djQuery> myosotis, are they contained in anyting?
[07:13:12] <djQuery> myosotis, see ?serialize
[07:13:13] <bot-t> myosotis, .serialize(): Encode a set of form elements as a string for submission. http://api.jquery.com/serialize/
[07:13:48] <myosotis> yes, I should have read more. I can select all children of the container, and jquery will serialize the correct elements for me, thanks for the response
[07:14:13] <myosotis> jquery('.something *').serialize() appears to work like I want.
[07:14:32] <djQuery> myosotis, The .serialize() method can act on a jQuery object that has selected individual form elements, such as <input>, <textarea>, and <select>. However, it is typically easier to select the <form> tag itself for serialization
[07:15:27] <myosotis> yeah, I made it to api.jquery.org after I asked that q. The docs.jquery.com version of serialize is slightly less useful
[07:15:30] <Bheam> $(document).on('load', function() {}) doesn't do anything for me?
[07:16:01] <djQuery> Bheam, how about just $(document).load
[07:18:19] <noregret> I have a var with html content, how can I use selectors and change some stuff ? I tried with http://pastebin.com/3z7vuVeX but the result avlink is an object, how can I convert it to a string ?
[07:21:21] <fairuz> getJSON is just wrapper around ajax. Is this correct?
[07:21:51] <NoiseEee> http://jsfiddle.net/G39ar/ @ noregret
[07:22:08] <rmill> fairuz: Yep.
[07:22:27] <fairuz> rmill: ok sweet ty
[07:22:48] <rmill> fairuz: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getJSON/#entry-longdesc
[07:23:07] <rmill> Shows the .ajax equivalent.
[07:24:31] <noregret> NoiseEee: i got a bit confused, what is wrong in my way ?
[07:25:16] <fairuz> Ah didn;t see that when I look at the page earlier :)
[07:25:26] <noregret> NoiseEee: nevermind, figured it out
[07:26:05] <davetarmac> hey guys - anyone in here today used MetroJs? I'm having some trouble with the animationComplete attribute function and seeting up a delay in there
[07:26:40] <NoiseEee> noregret: beauty
[07:28:01] <davetarmac> I've tried jQuery(this).delay(10000) and window.setTimeout(function() { /* nothing here */ }, 10000); and they didn't seem to work
[07:29:04] <davetarmac> althgough no errors showed up in the Chrome console
[07:29:28] <davetarmac> this is what I have so far: http://jsfiddle.net/sHbPS/5/

[07:31:31] <der_On> hi. I'm currently writing frontend unit tests for a drawing application and need to trigger mouse click and drag events on certain screen positions. is that possible somehow?
[07:33:44] <dcherman> der_On: you can certainly use .trigger( "click" ) and so on.  if you need actual events from real browser interaction, you're going to have to use something like selenium.
[07:34:05] <der_On> just found it in the docs. I can to trigger( eventObject)
[07:34:11] <der_On> and create the event before
[07:34:15] <der_On> that's what I need
[07:34:59] <Tomashe> hey guys im trying to create a jquery script that makes a loop every few seconds so i use setInterval to make that BUT i want that when im hover that element the script wont make the loop
[07:35:02] <Tomashe> how do i do it ?
[07:35:14] <Tomashe> so it will just freeze untill im removing my mouse
[07:35:59] <pachet> ?g clearInterval
[07:36:00] <b-ot> pachet: window.clearInterval - Document Object Model (DOM) | MDN → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/window.clearInterval
[07:36:05] <pachet> Tomashe^
[07:36:11] <bot-t> pachet, window.clearInterval - Document Object Model (DOM) | MDN - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/window.clearInterval
[07:36:20] <pachet> bot-t you lose
[07:36:45] <Tomashe> ok so clearInterval and then when over to trigger it again
[07:36:47] <Tomashe> Nice!
[07:37:01] <Tomashe> and what if i use mroe then 1 Interval
[07:37:02] <Tomashe> ?
[07:37:07] <Tomashe> and i want to clear just one
[07:38:09] <Anticom> hi guys
[07:38:10] <Anticom> in this example here: http://jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#custom-data
[07:38:10] <Anticom> why is the focus callback needed and what does it do?
[07:38:11] <Anticom> i know, i could simply try it myself but i want to understand the deeper meaning
[07:38:34] <xenaxon> how to vertically align a div
[07:39:40] <xenaxon> How to vertically align 2 divs inside another div
[07:40:00] <xenaxon> I have PREVIOUS and NEXT buttons and need to vertically align them
[07:40:06] <xenaxon> one to the left and the other to the right
[07:40:21] <NoiseEee> xenaxon: #css
[07:40:43] <Anticom> wtf
[07:40:52] <Anticom> i can't "?p @ someone" :O
[07:42:12] <Anticom> xec u there, grand master of jq? :P
[07:45:15] <seutje> xenaxon: display: table-cell; vertical-align: middle;
[07:46:04] <pachet> Anticom: its needed so that when you mouse over one of the suggested items, the value in the actual textbox is updated
[07:47:52] <chilversc_> there needs to be some nicer way to make widget libraries work properly with templating libraries
[07:48:30] <Anticom> chilversc_ no one is keeping you from implementing one :P
[07:48:42] <Anticom> pachet ok so when i want to store some other data, that should not be displayed using html5-data, that doesn't go into focus callback but into the select callback (?)
[07:49:30] <seutje> Anticom: that implementation seems to be because it's using the label rather than the value
[07:49:38] <seutje> Anticom: by default it would copy over the value
[07:49:53] <seutje> the return false is probably to counter said behavior
[07:50:18] <Anticom> seutje ok, cheers
[07:50:23] <Anticom> i'll give it a shot
[07:50:34] <Anticom> just wondering, where Cork and xec are.... :D
[07:50:39] <seutje> u can see it updates the hidden field with the value
[07:50:51] <Anticom> what hidden field?
[07:50:59] <Anticom> didn't take a look @ the markup yet
[07:51:12] <Anticom> and i didn't work with jq-ui for like aeons it feels
[07:51:14] <seutje> <input type="hidden" id="project-id">
[07:51:31] <seutje> $( "#project-id" ).val( ui.item.value ); <- this in the select handler
[07:51:33] <Anticom> nah
[07:51:47] <Anticom> i'm gonna $('#project').data('myKey', 'myVal'); ;)
[07:51:53] <Anticom> this looks cleaner to mee
[07:51:55] <Anticom> me*
[07:52:01] <Anticom> and the DOM footprint is smaller
[07:52:18] <seutje> doesn't rly matter, xcept that data- shizzle isn't posted
[07:52:35] <seutje> like, if it's for a form, I'd stick to using regular values
[07:52:39] <Anticom> since i've got a custom closure for source, that doesn't matter ;)
[07:52:53] <seutje> cause then if for some reason the form gets a normal submit triggered, it'll still just work
[07:53:14] <Anticom> my application depends on js in every way
[07:53:24] <Anticom> so there's no need to assume js isn't enabled
[07:53:28] <Anticom> :)
[08:01:53] <noregret> NoiseEee: I just figured that wha i want is the whole html string.. and not the attrib =)
[08:02:18] <majalu> Hello, I''m yet to find a solution to this, any help would be appreciated… http://pastebin.com/mE2t824u
[08:04:00] <majalu> All my 'a' are different colors, so trying to store 'a' color as a var?
[08:08:47] <BillCriswell> majalu: Are you trying to hover and get a random color and revert back to the original color?
[08:09:52] <majalu> BillCriswell: Yes, but random colour from array.
[08:10:50] <BillCriswell> majalu: Hmmm.. trying to think of a good way to do it.
[08:11:21] <noregret> I have a var with html content, how can I use selectors and change some stuff ? I tried with http://pastebin.com/3z7vuVeX but the result avlink is an object, how can I convert it to a string ?
[08:11:56] <Anticom> is there any key event, that fires, before a value of an input[type=text] actually is changed? e.g. i got "foo" in my input field and now i'm pressing the letter "t" now i want to get "foo" as well as "foot"
[08:11:57] <BillCriswell> majalu: .data() comes to mind to store the original color, but I feel like there should be a cleaner way.
[08:12:21] <majalu> Different links are different colours, so I'd like to set $(this).css('color'); as the var somehow?
[08:13:12] <majalu> $('a').css('color'); returns the first 'a' color :(
[08:13:18] <BillCriswell> You could make it a global but I feel like there's better ways.
[08:14:37] <Anticom> majalu if i got it right about what u want to do... just set the color via .css('color', [randomColor]) on 'hover' and and remove it again on 'blurr' using .css('color', '');
[08:15:05] <MathiasaurusRex> you could create a class that has the random color in it and then $('#class').addClass('color'); on hover
[08:15:34] <majalu> Thanks all for your input… http://pastebin.com/mE2t824u
[08:15:45] <Anticom> majalu why aren't u using jsfiddle?
[08:15:54] <majalu> The above works fine, apart from storing the 'a' that is hovered color
[08:15:58] <seutje> majalu: replace "original" with ""
[08:16:06] <seutje> forget about storing it
[08:16:19] <Anticom> true words :)
[08:16:24] <seutje> ur overriding it with an inline style, just remove said inline style and it'll fall back to whatever is in the css
[08:16:40] <Anticom> browser will restore its original state by itself, when there's no css attribute attatched to the element
[08:17:12] <Anticom> seutje thought, .css() was just a wrapper arround inline-style attribute? :O
[08:17:21] <Anticom> or is it doing anything more than that?
[08:17:39] <seutje> it replaces if the prop is already present
[08:17:55] <BillCriswell> seutje: You saying .removeAttr('style') ?
[08:17:56] <Anticom> sure does
[08:17:58] <noregret> http://jsfiddle.net/3NLyq/ I want a string, not an object, any ideas ?
[08:18:03] <Anticom> BillCriswell bad idea
[08:18:14] <Anticom> as i said use .css('color', '');
[08:19:02] <BillCriswell> Hm.
[08:19:16] <majalu> seutje: Genius
[08:19:27] <majalu> Works lovelu
[08:19:30] <majalu> lovely*
[08:19:54] <BillCriswell> Anticom: Did not expect it to work like that.
[08:19:55] <Anticom> noregret http://jsfiddle.net/3NLyq/1/
[08:20:00] <Anticom> simple, aye ;)
[08:20:13] <Anticom> BillCriswell it's all in the docs :D
[08:20:33] <seutje> BillCriswell: nah, that would remove *all* inline styles
[08:20:36] <seutje> majalu: http://jsfiddle.net/mzXs7/
[08:20:41] <Anticom> noregret i suppose, you wanted the href attribute as a string
[08:20:41] <noregret> Anticom: i don't want the href, i want the whole html string, inclding the anchor and its attribs
[08:20:44] <BillCriswell> seutje: Haha I got it now.
[08:21:05] <Anticom> ah okay
[08:21:18] <BillCriswell> I just thought .css('color', '') would restore to like.. browser defaults. Thought about that completely the wrong way. Good thing I don't use that part of it often.
[08:21:50] <majalu> seutje: I'll use your code, looks a lot neater.
[08:22:00] <majalu> Thanks all for your help.
[08:22:41] <fuchstronaut> Any idea how to make JQuery UI's drop placeholder the element that is beeing sorted ?
[08:23:16] <Anticom> noregret there's an attribute called outerHTML in the native DOM
[08:23:17] <Anticom> http://jsfiddle.net/3NLyq/2/
[08:23:21] <Anticom> utilize that one
[08:24:01] <Anticom> fuchstronaut lol why would u do that?
[08:24:32] <Anticom> but in generall i guess a container can both be .draggable AND .droppable
[08:24:41] <Anticom> although i'm not that much into jq-ui
[08:24:49] <fuchstronaut> http://tool-man.org/ToolManDHTML/sorting.html like in this Example (aplha, bravo, charlie)
[08:24:50] <Anticom> noregret is that, what u wanted?
[08:25:59] <noregret> Anticom: yep, taht's it
[08:26:03] <Anticom> fuchstronaut can't drag anything on that page
[08:26:09] <Anticom> noregret never forgett about plain-js ;)
[08:26:17] <BillCriswell> Anticom: I'll be dammed. That actual code was right in the docs lol
[08:26:18] <noregret> i actually remember solving this issue using only jquery, but can't remember how
[08:26:22] <noregret> Anticom: ^
[08:26:29] <Anticom> BillCriswell what code?
[08:26:38] <BillCriswell> .css('color', '')
[08:27:14] <Anticom> BillCriswell well, setting an attribute to an empty string using the .css method basically removes it
[08:27:38] <Anticom> that works for every style attribute... and since it's removed from the element, its properties then fall back to the browsers default
[08:27:52] <Anticom> this is very useful for destructors in custom ui-plugins :)
[08:28:30] <BillCriswell> Anticom: Understand that now.
[08:28:41] <Anticom> cheers
[08:29:03] <Wolfed-> is it possible to pass variables as array keys?
[08:29:21] <Wolfed-> or object keys, not quiet sure what those are :P
[08:29:31] <BillCriswell> foo[someVar] = 'poop'
[08:30:31] <Anticom> pass what from where to where Wolfed- ?
[08:30:43] <Wolfed-> Lemme recheck this, I think I was doing a wrong approach
[08:30:43] <Wolfed-> :P
[08:31:17] <Anticom> Wolfed- be sure about what u actually want to do before trying to implement something super-awesome-and-wonderful you actually don't need ;)
[08:31:53] <BillCriswell> var person = {}, someProperty = 'name'; person[someProperty] = 'Bill'
[08:32:29] <Dirkos> http://jsfiddle.net/e97Nx/ > Why isn't this the element on which the function is called?
[08:32:56] <Wolfed-> Yeah I was. Got it right now, Thanks though :)
[08:37:07] <Dirkos> http://jsfiddle.net/e97Nx/ > Why isn't this the element on which the function is called?
[08:38:45] <djQuery> Dirkos, becuase setinterval is attached to the window
[08:39:10] <djQuery> Dirkos, pas the elm as a param
[08:39:41] <Dirkos> hmm isnt there a way todo this without passing as param?
[08:41:31] <anew> so i'm testing this ajax image upload... the problem is server side i'm doing some image manipulation so i cant tell if it's failing there or on upload
[08:41:40] <anew> where can i cut it off to see if the file is being put on server ?
[08:41:51] <anew> i am returning the filepath during success
[08:41:56] <anew> and i see that c:/fakepath/image.img
[08:42:02] <NoiseEee> anew: start by debugging the backend?
[08:42:05] <anew> if that means anything, does that mean it uploaded to server ?
[08:42:20] <anew> yeah but how can i debug backend, where can i test it
[08:42:22] <NoiseEee> "where can i cut it off to see if the file is being put on server" = debug your back-end stuff
[08:42:28] <anew> i thought i should start with clientside
[08:42:41] <NoiseEee> well you need to know if the backend is doign what you expect it to?
[08:42:56] <NoiseEee> so adjust your .php or whatever script is doing stuff with the image
[08:43:05] <anew> yes, but after this? otherwise i have to build a whole new input?
[08:44:03] <NoiseEee> "c:/fakepath/image.img" is what the browser reports as the value of an <input type='file'>.  browsers won't let you know the path of the file the person has selected to upload.
[08:44:26] <NoiseEee> anew: so, whats your issue
[08:44:26] <anew> noiseeee if i see that in sucess data, does that mean the file made it ?
[08:44:39] <NoiseEee> anew: i give up?  how does your app work?
[08:44:48] <anew> i var_dump($_FILE) server side and see that
[08:44:55] <anew> well give me a second will fiddle it then
[08:44:59] <NoiseEee> anew: don't fiddle
[08:45:07] <NoiseEee> go on the backside and examine $_FILES
[08:45:32] <anew> do you know the folder that is saved in ? on apache ?
[08:46:53] <NoiseEee> anew: you should probably learn ##php.
[08:47:08] <anew> :/
[08:47:21] <pachet> its just the php temp directory
[08:47:33] <pachet> configurable in your ini
[08:47:37] <pachet> but yeah, ##php
[08:53:44] <elijah> Is it possible to inject a callback function into a slideUp() that already has been loaded?
[08:54:13] <elijah> Drupal has a file that I cannot alter but I want to have a function fire after it executes slideUp() on a fieldset.
[08:54:27] <elijah> It works great editing the file in chrome dev tools...
[08:54:53] <elijah> A hook_alter is what I am looking for
[08:55:02] <Che-Anarc> From within #&ui-state=dialog of a child page I: <a href"../parent/view"> but I still get the end fragment & even though there are no dialogs on that page I get the previous dialog - I'm using jQm & ajax is off on all links.
[09:05:20] <BrandonE> I am trying to make it so that when you click any <a> element with '.bjqs-transition' as a class, all of the elements with the class '.youtube' have their src's set to ''. http://slexy.org/view/s2oAhPAgHV - It seems like the $('.bjqs-transition').click event isn't being triggered. What might be the issue?
[09:09:44] <_Archer_> @BrandonE What version of jQuery are you using?
[09:13:49] <djQuery> BrandonE, there is no point in your each
[09:14:03] <NoiseEee> BrandonE: $('#commonContainerID').on('click','a.bjqs-transition',function(e) { //console.log('clicked!!'); });
[09:14:40] <BrandonE> djQuery: There's going to be a reason for it in a minute
[09:16:22] <BrandonE> NoiseEee: Why can't I do this directly on .bjqs-transition if that's on all of the <a>s that will be clicked?
[09:17:07] <NoiseEee> BrandonE: you could, but then you'd be setting X number of handlers
[09:17:12] <NoiseEee> BrandonE: as opposed to one.
[09:17:55] <BrandonE> NoiseEee: Why is this necessary to accomplish this? I can't use click() directly on a class?
[09:18:07] <NoiseEee> BrandonE: $('#commonContainerID').on('click','a.bjqs-transition',function(e) { $('a.youtube').prop('href','slexy.org/etc'); });
[09:18:33] <NoiseEee> BrandonE: don't use click, its a gross shortcut.  use 'on', and why not manage memory more efficiently?
[09:18:56] <BrandonE> I don't understand the difference really
[09:19:13] <NoiseEee> BrandonE: $('a.something').on('click')  <--- setting a handler on all a.somethings
[09:19:26] <NoiseEee> BrandonE: vs setting one handling, and using event delegation
[09:22:35] <BrandonE> sounds good, thanks
[09:25:05] <_Archer_> BrandomE - do the links all exist when you add the event handler?  (Are they dynamic?  Is the event handler assigned during document.ready?)
[09:25:12] <_Archer_> BrandonE - do the links all exist when you add the event handler?  (Are they dynamic?  Is the event handler assigned during document.ready?)
[09:25:49] <BrandonE> _Archer_: Perhaps not. I'm using someone else's library who's probably also generating these links on document ready
[09:27:16] <NoiseEee> BrandonE: all the more reason for using event delegation :)
[09:28:01] <BrandonE> NoiseEee: Are you saying that it's also bad to use .click even for id's instead of classes?
[09:28:59] <pachet> it just reduces the amount of control you have over the handler
[09:29:02] <pachet> harder to scale
[09:29:10] <pachet> compared to $('#foo').on('click.somenamespace', fn)
[09:29:33] <pachet> then you can unbind that fn specifically via the namespace eg .off('click.somenamespace')
[09:30:00] <pachet> as opposed to just using .off('click') and potentially catching other innocent handlers in the crossfier
[09:30:04] <pachet> s/fier/fire
[09:30:20] <NoiseEee> BrandonE: yes,  el.<someAction> is terrible imo.   .on() for everything.
[09:30:29] <_Archer_> BrandonE - open the page, open the console and paste this into it... $('.bjqs-transition').on("click", function() { $('.youtube').attr('src', ''); });
[09:30:39] <_Archer_> BrandonE - then click one of the links and see if it works
[09:30:52] <NoiseEee> BrandonE: also the example i gave you of event-delegation takes care of the 'issue' of adding elements dynamically and having them behave the same way as pre-existing ones
[09:31:04] <BrandonE> I've already determined that .on works for this
[09:31:16] <_Archer_> NoiseEee - it depends which version of jQuery - he may be using an older version of compatibility with other plugins and libraries
[09:31:53] <_Archer_> *for* compatibility

[09:33:09] <tomasm-> hi, i have a problem with the theme roller for jquery ui... when I roll my own custom theme, the jquery-ui-XXX.css file is MISSING the positioning and z-index stuff , so modals/dialogs are on the bottom... I've compared it against a standard theme css file, and it's missing stuff.... specifically 'ui-front' is totally omitted, and only the color stuff is mentioned for ui-widget-overlay (instead of positioning too)
[09:34:23] <tomasm-> the 'roll your own theme' seems b0rk3n
[09:34:23] <_Archer_> NoiseEee - heh very true mate

[09:37:37] <DarsVaeda> hi I have a table with several rows, I add a sortable to that table, but I want to exclude rows with a specific class, is this possible?
[09:38:10] <DarsVaeda> so only rows without that class can be sorted
[09:38:27] <anew> ok if i var_dump($_FILES); to function(success) of an ajax call - and that is empty, does that mean the file is not there ?
[09:38:35] <slash_nick> unfamiliar with sortable...hm
[09:39:23] <slash_nick> no idea DarsVaeda
[09:39:26] <djQuery> DarsVaeda, I thought one of the examples had a disbabled example
[09:40:06] <tomasm-> DarsVaeda, you probably are better off using tbody around some of the rows, and then assign a class to the selector, 'item: '> tbody.whatever' or something
[09:40:10] <djQuery> DarsVaeda, yeppers http://jqueryui.com/sortable/#items
[09:40:16] <DarsVaeda> dj:your right...I have to go home didn't saw that
[09:40:22] <DarsVaeda> thanks :)
[09:41:34] <_Archer_> DarsVaeda http://goo.gl/yHHRn
[09:41:35] <davetarmac> I've got this - what I'm trying to achieve (using Cycle) is in the CSS section: http://jsfiddle.net/sHbPS/9/
[09:42:51] <DarsVaeda> thanks _Archer_
[09:43:58] <djQuery> davetarmac, sounds like you need to check to see if cycle has a callback for each of the cycles
[09:48:23] <zfly9> Anyone know how I can use addClass to put a class "current-slide" on the displayed slide on this http://malsup.com/jquery/cycle/lite/
[09:49:18] <anew> ok if i var_dump($_FILES); to function(success) of an ajax call - and that is empty, does that mean the file is not there ?
[09:49:51] <davetarmac> djQuery - any idea how to do this?
[09:50:24] <systemfault> anew: Unless you use XHR2 or an iframe hack, you cannot send files with AJAX
[09:50:38] <anew> systemfault how are these jq plugins doing it ?
[09:51:21] <systemfault> The way I just told you… most plugins do it with XHR2 with a iframe hack fallback
[09:52:00] <anew> ok so they use that method, will see if i can use one of those.  but can i send form data with that? all the ones i see are only file uploads
[09:52:29] <systemfault> Usually, yes.. those plugins allow sending additional form data with the file.
[09:52:55] <anew> hmm ok thx
[09:54:06] <anew> systemfault one other question
[09:54:07] <anew> http://www.phpletter.com/Demo/AjaxFileUpload-Demo/
[09:54:14] <anew> can i make this 'upload' button a 'submit' button ?
[09:54:15] <_Archer_> zflt9 - it's always the first image, so $("#containerID img:first")
[09:54:19] <pachet> ?g mdn formdata @ anew
[09:54:20] <b-ot> anew: How to recover lost form data in your Web browser - Tech and Gadgets → http://tech.ca.msn.com/how-to/storyviewer.aspx?cp-documentid=256248712
[09:54:21] <bot-t> anew, FormData - Document Object Model (DOM) | MDN - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/XMLHttpRequest/FormData
[09:54:37] <pachet> anew: er, ignore b-ot, bot-t's got the right one
[09:54:44] <anew> what so lost
[09:54:47] <pachet> basically create a new FormData object, append whatever you want to that
[09:54:55] <pachet> and then submit it or .send() via xhr2
[09:55:08] <anew> pachet here https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/XMLHttpRequest/FormData
[09:55:09] <anew> ?
[09:55:16] <pachet> yup
[09:55:47] <systemfault> Too bad XHR2 is not available on widely used browsers..
[09:55:56] <systemfault> *some widely"
[09:56:03] <_Archer_> zfly9 - it's always the first image, so $("#containerID img:first") in jQuery, or #containerID img:first-child in css
[09:56:03] <anew> internet explorer ?
[09:56:26] <systemfault> anew: Heh..
[09:56:53] <anew> man this is a nigthmare, there must be some prepackaged solution
[09:56:54] <_Archer_> anew - please don't swear.  This is a public chatroom :p
[09:57:02] <anew> lol
[09:58:14] <zfly9> _Archer_ I don't follow...
[09:58:32] <anew> so guys... can i do two ajax upload simultaneously with one button click ?
[09:58:54] <anew> like onsubmit="formUpload(); fileUpload();"
[09:59:12] <anew> i guess worth a try
[10:00:02] <pachet> you can, but you really shouldnt use inline handlers
[10:00:19] <_Archer_> zfly9 - I guess you want to add a class to the displayed image so you can add styling to it.  Just use _#containerID img:first-child_ in css instead as the displayed image is always the first one in the container
[10:00:25] <anew> ok, well what about in the success callback of another ajax call
[10:00:30] <anew> can i put two of those in there pachet
[10:00:55] <pachet> er, sure :[
[10:02:04] <anew> is that wrong ?
[10:02:13] <anew> one second let me show u
[10:02:26] <anew> http://jsfiddle.net/xu8Mg/2/
[10:02:31] <anew> for example on the bottom is my ajax call
[10:02:42] <anew> inside the second success, i already have the form submitting (which works)
[10:03:09] <anew> but i would also like to put this plugin i found http://www.phpletter.com/Demo/AjaxFileUpload-Demo/
[10:03:11] <anew> to upload the file
[10:03:31] <anew> can i just put $.ajaxFileUpload inside the success of the sedone one?
[10:03:38] <anew> i just dont want to start working on it if it's incorrect
[10:05:14] <djQuery> davetarmac, you migth want to look at the documentation for it onPrevNextEvent
[10:10:02] <davetarmac> cheers djQuery - I'll take a look at that tonight
[10:13:25] <amh345> afternoon everyone.  im having a noob issue populating some divs via .load http://jsfiddle.net/dEKXV/     error is Uncaught TypeError: Illegal invocation
[10:14:07] <amh345> what is the correct way to populate divs with data via .load?
[10:14:58] <_Archer_> amh345 - $("#divID").load("somepage.html")
[10:15:30] <amh345> _Archer_:  i got that part working.  but im also trying to set some html in the function.
[10:15:54] <amh345> the function is getting the values. but i just cant get them to update the file from .load
[10:16:00] <_Archer_> amh345 what are you trying to do?
[10:16:26] <_Archer_> amh345 - what do you mean, "update the file"?
[10:16:27] <amh345> _Archer_: i've got a zip code checker deal.   so i want to display the results of the zip code query.
[10:16:53] <_Archer_> amh345 - how do you run the zip code query?
[10:17:01] <amh345> in my function i have the data from the zip code check.  i want to load the results html and put the data in the function in the divs withinth the loaded html
[10:17:41] <amh345> i run it server side. return results via json.    but the details of the zipcode result aside. i cant even get static content to update the div
[10:18:37] <enerel1> guys how can i update AMOUNT part? http://jsfiddle.net/txvCN/
[10:19:54] <enerel1> anyone
[10:20:32] <amh345> _Archer_: for example. i can set #zipdetails .html with the var hihi in this example. http://jsfiddle.net/dEKXV/1/    there's no json or anything involved.  just static values
[10:20:39] <amh345> cant* set, i mean
[10:21:35] <enerel1> http://jsfiddle.net/txvCN/ why $ part is not updating?
[10:22:37] <nostriluu> hi #jquery. i've got this : var $html = $(output); and i want to do this: var res = $html.find('body').replaceWith(processed).find('html').html(); but $html is an object rather than html text. i'm running jquery under nodejs, if it matters. thanks for any help.
[10:23:22] <nostriluu> (but $html becomes an object rather than the text i want)
[10:25:02] <enerel1> http://jsfiddle.net/txvCN/ why $ amount input is not updating? any clue?
[10:26:28] <_Archer_> amh345 - on the page in question, open the console and enter this - $("body").load("assets/display_zip.html");
[10:26:38] <_Archer_> It should work or show an error
[10:26:56] <enerel1> Archer help
[10:27:01] <amh345> _Archer_: all that works fine.
[10:27:05] <amh345> it updated my body
[10:28:08] <anew> http://mathandprogramming.blogspot.com.es/2010/12/uploading-file-with-jquery.html
[10:28:12] <anew> i'm looking at this example
[10:28:17] <_Archer_> amh345 - then that's the code you need then, or am I misunderstanding something?  What you were doing with the callback and "hihi" was wrong.  It's just a straight call that populates a selected element with loaded data
[10:28:19] <anew> and he has action="text.cgi"
[10:28:27] <anew> but where is the js controlling the form? i dont get it ?
[10:28:35] <anew> if on submit u just go to a server file ...
[10:28:38] <anew> what is the jq doing
[10:29:11] <Ortund> So I'm moving my weather feed jquery to a plugin, but as it requires values to be passed to it from the server, I need to use options... do I pass them as JSON format ( key : value ) or what?
[10:29:12] <amh345> _Archer_: what im trying to do is update the div in the loaded file with the value of var hihi
[10:30:27] <Ortund> Current my code .::. var defaults = { mainImage : "";  } is telling me "Unexpected token :"
[10:30:38] <systemfault> Sure
[10:30:43] <Ortund> it should be , and not ; right?
[10:30:55] <systemfault> There's no ; before the }
[10:31:07] <_Archer_> amh345 - try this $("body").load("assets/display_zip.html", { $("#zipdetails").html("hi") });
[10:31:10] <systemfault> var defaults = { mainImage : "";  } // BAD var defaults = { mainImage : "" };
[10:31:22] <systemfault> / GOOD
[10:31:25] <enerel1> http://jsfiddle.net/txvCN/ why $ amount input is not updating? any clue?
[10:32:10] <Ortund> hehe systemfault it's my first ever plugin
[10:32:21] <Ortund> feel like I'm wandering around in the dark here
[10:32:53] <enerel1> anyone answer my question
[10:33:41] <amh345> _Archer_: hmm. that throws an error Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token (
[10:33:44] <amh345> but i cant see where
[10:34:31] <anew> ok ... so if on a success callback from ajax, if i wanted to execute a php file, how would i do that
[10:34:49] <enerel1> does anyone explain what is wrong here $( "#amount" ).val( 0.01 *amnt );
[10:36:28] <enerel1> anyone explain what is wrong here $( "#amount" ).val( 0.01 *amnt );
[10:37:02] <Ortund> http://pastebin.com/Qntbiq7a ... I'm getting errors to do with how everything's closed off at the end of the code, but removing the characters that Chrome complains about is just breaking it more
[10:37:23] <anew> how on success callback can i submit <form id="myForm">
[10:37:57] <enerel1> what is UI channel name?
[10:38:01] <_Archer_> ahm345 - sorry, my mistake - $("body").load("assets/display_zip.html", function () { $("#zipdetails").html("hi"); });
[10:38:12] <hlve> Soooo question. How would I take the div below the radio list, and move it under #radio1 using jQuery? http://jsfiddle.net/JZRvW/1/
[10:38:12] <hlve> The reason I ask is because the actual code I'm using is a ASP radio button list. I can't just place HTML in between the code.
[10:38:14] <enerel1> what is UI channel name?
[10:38:14] <_Archer_> It's been a long day :p
[10:38:19] <hlve>  Is there any way to use something like insertAfter?   Or would I need to use insertAfter and create the div element using that?
[10:38:31] <enerel1> what is UI channel name?
[10:38:39] <_Archer_> hlve - you can use .before and .after to move things
[10:39:58] <hlve> _Archer_, isn't before / after the same thing as insertbefore/insertafter?
[10:40:02] <enerel1> what is UI channel name?
[10:40:03] <enerel1> what is UI channel name?
[10:40:03] <enerel1> what is UI channel name?
[10:40:04] <enerel1> what is UI channel name?
[10:40:05] <enerel1> what is UI channel name?
[10:40:12] <anew> wtf
[10:40:15] <hlve> enerel1, stop fucking spamming
[10:40:22] <NoiseEee> enerel1: man, you're only 15 times away from getting the answer
[10:40:45] <hlve> lol
[10:40:48] <enerel1> lol i thought you guys not reading my posts
[10:40:56] <hlve> so you spam it?
[10:41:09] <hlve> that makes sense. *_*
[10:41:26] <enerel1> do not just sit and count what i type. try to help guys
[10:41:36] <hlve> enerel1, not when you ask like that. no.
[10:42:30] <enerel1> so i have this script
[10:42:32] <enerel1> http://jsfiddle.net/txvCN/
[10:42:47] <enerel1> input field does not update
[10:43:17] <enerel1> everyone is ignoring
[10:43:20] <enerel1> awesome
[10:43:29] <enerel1> thank you guys
[10:43:40] <pachet> good lord
[10:43:41] <enerel1> peace
[10:43:57] <hlve> do you have physiological issues dude?
[10:43:59] <_Archer_> enerel1 - bye :)
[10:43:59] <hlve> holy hell.
[10:44:20] <Ortund> can anyone look over my plugin code and help me figure out where I've gone wrong? I think I'm getting confused with the structure of it
[10:44:45] <hlve> _Archer_, after, and before do the same thing as insertbefore, insertafter right?
[10:44:57] <hlve> if so, how would I use .after to move an element, not create one?
[10:45:01] <_Archer_> hlve - before and insertBefore are the same, yes (just different syntax).  I use before and after to move elements around.  It doesn't duplicate - it moves - and no duplication is required.
[10:45:33] <enerel1> http://jsfiddle.net/txvCN/
[10:45:53] <_Archer_> hlve - if you had <div id="div1"></div><div id="div2"></div> you could do $("#div2").before("#div1") and it would move div2 before div1
[10:46:29] <enerel1> _Archer_: i have very weird error can you see my above link
[10:46:32] <hlve> $("#DivMove").after("#Radio1");  ... just inserted the text "#Radio1" after #DivMove lol
[10:47:19] <hlve> enerel1, didn't your parents ever teach you to wait your turn?
[10:47:20] <hlve> lol
[10:47:32] <enerel1> aight
[10:47:46] <hlve> like, you clearly see him helping me, and you're like "OMG GUYZ WHY YOU IGNORIN ME!!1".
[10:47:53] <hlve> relax. they'll get to you when they get to you.
[10:48:03] <enerel1> mine is so easy
[10:48:10] <enerel1> for them
[10:48:22] <hlve> I hope nobody even helps you dude. You're beyond rude.
[10:48:35] <enerel1> no i am too nice
[10:48:37] <Ortund> lol here I am asking for someone to look over my plugin's code and I didn't even paste a link -> http://pastebin.com/3kdtf0uP
[10:49:02] <enerel1> Ortund: relax no one will answer anyway
[10:49:08] <Eureka> @h1ve try this http://jsfiddle.net/yoboubdir/x4s92/
[10:49:11] <_Archer_> hlve - sorry - $("#div1").after($("#div2"));
[10:49:26] <_Archer_> I normally use variables for elements so I got the syntax wrong
[10:49:27] <hlve> _Archer_, thanks :)
[10:49:29] <_Archer_> enerel1
[10:49:31] <hlve> No worries.
[10:49:32] <_Archer_> enerel1 http://jsfiddle.net/txvCN/1/
[10:49:42] <hlve> Appreciate the help
[10:49:48] <_Archer_> hlve no worries :)
[10:50:17] <enerel1> _Archer_: i love you
[10:50:21] <Ortund> enerel1, nobody here gets paid to answer questions. It's all done in their spare time and it's their prerogative to answer or not. I can assure you, whining about not getting an answer will get you nowhere
[10:50:46] <enerel1> _Archer_: you are awesome
[10:51:00] <_Archer_> enerel1 don't tell my boyfriend - he'll go mad! >:X
[10:51:08] <Ortund> just try to be respectful and you'll get the help you need
[10:52:18] <enerel1> fuck that was so easy
[10:52:39] <Ortund> heh sometimes it just takes another pair of eyes
[10:52:39] <enerel1> i should put that in the loop
[10:52:56] <enerel1> thanks guys
[10:53:00] <enerel1> see you later
[10:53:10] <nostriluu> ok i'm not being rude, just asking again. i've got this : var $html = $(output); and i want to do this: var res = $html.find('body').replaceWith(processed).find('html').html(); but $html is an object rather than the html text i want. i seem to be able to retreive anything 'below' <html> (like <head>) but not html itself.
[10:53:40] <hlve> _Archer_, appreciate it. I'm testing it now
[10:55:17] <Aamir> nostriluu: your question is not clear
[10:55:36] <enerel1> i think he is trying to copy whole HTML
[10:55:47] <Aamir> why? :|
[10:56:02] <enerel1> yes why
[11:03:29] <anew> on success from an ajax request, if i return true, does that submit the form i pressed the button on ?
[11:04:55] <enerel1> anew: yes i think so
[11:05:09] <enerel1> do prevent default
[11:05:17] <anew> enerell do i have to return true, or will it just automatically do it
[11:05:54] <nostriluu> why, because i am using jquery in a nodejs module that is processing the html
[11:07:31] <enerel1> anew: $("#post").data("valid", true).submit();
[11:08:01] <anew> that's great thanks

[11:20:16] <porton> There are N <input type=text> fields which are outside <form> tag. What is the best way to submit values of these N fields when the <form> is submitted?
[11:20:19] <b-ot> porton: No output.
[11:20:35] <porton> b-ot: What?
[11:20:36] <b-ot> porton: my sources say no.
[11:20:38] <NoiseEee> porton: gross.
[11:20:54] <Ortund> So can anyone check out my code here? I keep getting Unexpected token errors, but removing them breaks the code even more http://pastebin.com/3kdtf0uP
[11:21:04] <porton> Should I create N hidden fields, or submit all N in one using JSON?
[11:21:10] <NoiseEee> porton: the best way is to move your <form> !
[11:21:34] <NoiseEee> porton: whatever works for you.  there is no 'best way' since the best practice was left behind :)
[11:21:48] <Ortund> seems that the closing brackets are wrong... or I'm missing some concept or other
[11:22:04] <porton> NoiseEee: I need to have a <input type=file> outside this form (to be inside an other form). This drives the need to have these N text fields also outside
[11:22:31] <porton> ... HTML is silly, but that's the way I do
[11:23:06] <NoiseEee> porton: so just do whatever makes sense for you on the backend :)

[11:54:40] <djQuery> but because I am using .on   I cant just e.stopPropagation
[11:55:13] <bil`> djQuery: look at the 'this' object in your handler function
[11:56:44] <bil`> the element of the click event will be assigned to 'this'
[11:57:08] <kojul> djQuery: listen to bil` or play with e.currentTarget, e.target, e.relatedTarget, and e.delegateTarget to figure out which one you want.
[11:57:26] <pachet> e.target will be the element that the event originated on
[11:58:14] <bil`> don't forget to pass e/event into your handler function if you do it that way

[12:02:40] <djQuery> bil`, if(e.originalEvent.srcElement.nodeName ==="A"){ return; }
[12:04:07] <bil`> djQuery: what are you trying to do in the larger scheme of things. it sound alike you're trying to do your own stop propagation ?
[12:04:08] <pachet> :[
[12:07:50] <CJKay> Hey all, is there a way of doing $("[style*='XXX']") that works in IE8 and earlier?
[12:08:11] <pachet> :[
[12:09:05] <NoiseEee> CJKay: that should work?
[12:10:32] <CJKay> It should, but [using IE's developer tools] when it hits that line the length is 0
[12:10:58] <NoiseEee> and you're certain you have elements with an inline style that includes 'XXX' ?
[12:11:06] <CJKay> Yes
[12:11:15] <CJKay> IE9 has length1
[12:11:27] <CJKay> Also works with Firefox and Chrome
[12:12:27] <NoiseEee> wow does jsfiddle not work at all with ie8?
[12:12:30] <mg983> I want to bind event/action into hooks at various events on my site. For example on page load, on an ajax call, when a user scrolls past X element, when a logged in user has an ajax refresh, when a logged in user loads page with the ID 123… is my best bet to just hook a method/function into each event … e.g. $(window).scroll(function(){ get_event({type:'scroll', user:201, page_id: 123}) });  and   $(document).ready(function(){ get_event({type:'load', user:
[12:12:42] <NoiseEee> i just booted into my VM and fiddle blows
[12:13:25] <CJKay_> ****
[12:13:36] <CJKay_> Back
[12:14:01] <mikehenriquez> guys any of you can help me with a variable issue here?? http://hsinteractivo.com/visa/
[12:14:11] <djQuery> NoiseEee, dunno don't have ie to test with here
[12:14:32] <mikehenriquez> when i click the right controller, console log returns the wrong attr name
[12:14:40] <mikehenriquez> left works fine
[12:15:19] <djQuery> mikehenriquez, right works for me
[12:15:40] <mikehenriquez> djQuery: it works but i cannot apply the correct class
[12:15:46] <luckyruby> I'm trying to add a click event on a button where it toggles a hidden div. Is there a way to detect inside the click event whether the hidden div is being shown or hidden?
[12:15:55] <mikehenriquez> because of the currentSlide variable
[12:16:32] <luckyruby> nm, figured it out
[12:16:44] <luckyruby> .is(":hidden")
[12:16:46] <mikehenriquez> if you can check your console you'll see that output returns the wrong attr
[12:17:16] <NoiseEee> CJKay_: yeah drag :P
[12:17:25] <NoiseEee> CJKay_: maybe use classes instead :)
[12:17:51] <CJKay_> Can't use classes, has to be inline styles heh. I'm checking for calc() inside style=""
[12:18:01] <hip2p> I have a span inside of a div. When I right click on the span, $(this).attr('id') gives me the id of the div. How do I make it so it gives me the id of the span? I tried setting the span's z-index to 1000, but that didn't work.
[12:18:06] <djQuery> mikehenriquez, what the heck is this ? 		$('#gallery ul img').each(function (){$('#gallery ul img').addClass('desaturate');});
[12:18:09] <luckyruby> what's the easiest way in jquery to uncheck something? .attr('checked', false) or is there a better way?
[12:19:08] <CJKay_> Wow it doesn't work in Chrome either :S
[12:19:11] <mikehenriquez> djQuery: this put the desaturate class to each img inside the li
[12:19:13] <mikehenriquez> why?
[12:19:15] <mikehenriquez> is wront?
[12:19:17] <mikehenriquez> wrong?
[12:19:38] <djQuery> luckyruby, think its prop('checked', false)  or in case of using attr use removeAttr('checked');
[12:19:59] <pachet> its .prop
[12:20:14] <pachet> .attr will actually update the DOM property
[12:20:14] <djQuery> mikehenriquez, inside the each your are just doing the same selector again
[12:20:24] <pachet> one of those cases where the api hands you a bone
[12:20:37] <mikehenriquez> hmm
[12:20:42] <mikehenriquez> instead of this
[12:20:50] <mikehenriquez> ;) let me fix that
[12:20:53] <djQuery> mikehenriquez,  the each is unneccessary  just do $('#gallery ul img').addClass('desaturate');
[12:21:05] <luckyruby> djQuery, pachet thanks
[12:21:05] <mikehenriquez> ok
[12:21:43] <CJKay_> $("[style*='calc(']") fails on pre-IE9 and Chrome
[12:22:17] <djQuery> mikehenriquez, always if you are doing an each it needs to be something different for each one or you didn't need the each
[12:22:32] <mikehenriquez> got it, and fix it
[12:22:38] <mikehenriquez> thanks for that :)
[12:23:15] <Joel> http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Validation - am I missing where it lists valid rules? I see email, and required, curious what other validate-rs are built in?
[12:23:35] <mikehenriquez> djQuery: what i don't know is why the right controller returns me the wrong attr
[12:24:15] <elijah> (noob) I am trying to have a siaf run on a page load, then I want to call that same siaf on a $(window).resize(). How would I pass this function into resize(). I have this but I cannot get it to work. http://paste.ubuntu.com/5611629/
[12:25:12] <djQuery> mikehenriquez, still reading it myself
[12:25:52] <djQuery> mikehenriquez, shouldn't that be currentslide -1 or soemthing
[12:26:01] <Joel> elijah: um, I'm no pro at JS but that looks all wrong to me.
[12:26:15] <Joel> elijah: either name your function, and pass the name in, or pass an anonymous function, like: http://api.jquery.com/resize/
[12:26:21] <otters> my VPS exploded
[12:26:26] <otters> did anybody solve my problem while I was gone
[12:26:40] <elijah> Joel: It works with another anon function but I was hoping to not have to have the function listed twice.
[12:26:45] <djQuery> otters, yes but he left
[12:26:52] <pachet> he hightailed it
[12:26:53] <Joel> elijah: so don't, so do what I first said.
[12:26:57] <pachet> laughing 'i have the answer'
[12:27:08] <elijah> joel: K, I tried that but will try again.
[12:27:08] <otters> rats
[12:27:15] <otters> okay we'll give this another shot
[12:27:18] <otters> http://jsfiddle.net/gyUGT/ click on "Toggle" twice quickly
[12:27:20] <otters> I can't figure out why the pink div is just stopping instead of sliding back down
[12:28:01] <mikehenriquez> djQuery: +1 didn't work
[12:28:22] <mikehenriquez> reading what? the js file?
[12:28:29] <hip2p> $(this).closest('div').attr('id') works fine. How would I do this if I set x = $(this).attr('id') and then tried $(x).closest('div').attr('id')?
[12:28:31] <djQuery> mikehenriquez, well its not gonna because the names are like i4 or what not
[12:29:01] <djQuery> mikehenriquez, so 'i4' +1 = 'i41'
[12:29:09] <mikehenriquez> exactly
[12:29:22] <Joel> elijah: not rocket science: http://pastebin.com/0ZxxwP2A
[12:29:33] <mikehenriquez> you suggest me to change names to numeric values?
[12:29:47] <NoiseEee> hip2p: $('#'+x)
[12:30:31] <hip2p> NoiseEee *sigh* of course... thank you
[12:30:43] <NoiseEee> np
[12:31:02] <mikehenriquez> djQuery: also i don't understand why the left controller works as i need
[12:31:02] <djQuery> mikehenriquez, or do some substrings and what not
[12:31:05] <mikehenriquez> its almost the same code
[12:31:34] <elijah> joel: This should work right? http://paste.ubuntu.com/5611651/
[12:31:48] <blh42> hi, i have a hard time getting .ajax.fail to work at all. ive tried both using the error setting and also having jqXHR.fail(). can someone help me pls? http://pastebin.com/xRLD3WUa
[12:31:50] <myosotis> there is some way to add event handlers to future elements. I think it was a function called live() ?
[12:31:51] <Joel> elijah: try it?
[12:32:01] <jackjackw> can anybody tell me why mousewheel.js does not work correctly on firefox/nightly on windows? :(
[12:32:05] <mikehenriquez> myosotis: yes
[12:32:08] <elijah> Joel: sorry, I did but it isn't working on resize
[12:32:14] <elijah> it fires on load
[12:32:14] <myosotis> is it still called live?
[12:32:19] <Joel> elijah: and when you resize?
[12:32:21] <djQuery> myosotis, see ?on
[12:32:22] <bot-t> myosotis, .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements, including delegation and live binding. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[12:32:24] <Joel> elijah: no console.log? no error?
[12:32:34] <elijah> joel: yeah, no console.log
[12:32:35] <djQuery> myosotis, live is dead
[12:32:36] <elijah> no error
[12:33:01] <myosotis> thanks djQuery! I thought I remembered it dying, but searching for "live" ended up being futile as you might imagine
[12:33:10] <elijah> joel: the last example at http://api.jquery.com/resize/ works fine on resize
[12:33:22] <Joel> elijah: url?
[12:33:34] <elijah> Basically, if I put the entire anon function in for resize() it works fine
[12:33:38] <elijah> It is on my local right now
[12:34:27] <djQuery> myosotis, http://api.jquery.com/live/    is fortunately updated stating that its dead err rather depreciated
[12:34:59] <Joel> elijah: 1: get it not local 2: try ditching parans 3: call function from anon-function (last resort)
[12:35:04] <Joel> params*
[12:35:19] <Joel> well, are you calling function with params?
[12:35:23] <Joel> also ditch the parenthesis.
[12:35:29] <Joel> elijah: http://learn.jquery.com/about-jquery/how-jquery-works/
[12:35:36] <Joel> "callbacks and functions"
[12:35:48] <illmat> otters: why don't you use just .slideToggle()?
[12:36:23] <otters> illmat: because i, like most people using jquery, solve my problem by calling random methods on DOM elements and hoping it works
[12:36:54] <otters> but yeah that fi
[12:36:57] <otters> fixed it
[12:37:29] <Joel> elijah: this works w/o issue: http://pastebin.com/9kaDmeQM
[12:38:01] <Joel> elijah: yeah, ditch parens, as per the the learn jquery link
[12:39:17] <elijah> Joel: AHhhhaaahahah, thanks!!!
[12:39:46] <Joel> elijah: did you notice how I broke it down into a fucking solveable problem?
[12:40:02] <Joel> elijah: if you learn nothing but, learn how to reproduce in a small easy piece of code.
[12:40:22] <Joel> be a pro at asking questions, you can suck at the rest :)
[12:40:45] <elijah> joel: thx again!
[12:40:49] <otiuk> if i do a $('.classname').attr('class','hide') that should set the class name to "hide" on all elements with class attr including "classname" right?
[12:41:22] <danheberden> nope - otiuk see @addClass
[12:41:25] <danheberden> oops
[12:41:29] <danheberden> ?AddClass
[12:41:29] <bot-t> .addClass(className): Adds the specified class(es) to each of the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/addClass/
[12:41:54] <danheberden> otiuk: if you *were* to manually set the class, it would be .prop('classname', 'hide')
[12:42:01] <danheberden> *className
[12:42:06] <danheberden> sorry, i'm typing awful today
[12:42:23] <Wolf_22> I'm using a FOR loop to loop through links in a DIV. How would I reassign the text and href values to each link from inside the FOR loop? I'm trying $(this).find('div a')[i] = <the new value> but it's not working. I also tried things like $(this).find('div a')[i].text('<new text>'), but this didn't work either...
[12:42:46] <otiuk> but doing $('.classname').whatever should effect all elements with class "classname" ya?
[12:43:34] <danheberden> otiuk: you are correct
[12:43:49] <danheberden> just changing the class attr of an element doesn't really do anything
[12:43:58] <zoned> Wolf_22: find returns an array
[12:43:59] <djQuery> mikehenriquez, lets start from here http://jsfiddle.net/djquery/tE3FR/
[12:44:07] <danheberden> you have to change the className property, either manually or using addClass, removeClass, toggleClass
[12:44:40] <Wolf_22> zoned: Thanks.
[12:46:22] <mikehenriquez> djQuery: awesome, im here
[12:46:51] <mikehenriquez> im in
[12:49:05] <aberrant> hi all
[12:50:18] <aberrant> I have a silly problem: I have two date/time input fields, and I'm doing a $(".datetime").datepicker() - but the issue is that when I manipulate the widget, it changes only the first input. Is there a better way of doing this?
[12:50:50] <aberrant> do I need to do a forEach?
[12:53:18] <mg983> I want to bind event/action into hooks at various events on my site. For example on page load, on an ajax call, when a user scrolls past X element, when a logged in user has an ajax refresh, when a logged in user loads page with the ID 123… is my best bet to just hook a method/function into each event … e.g. $(window).scroll(function(){ get_event({type:'scroll', user:201, page_id: 123}) });  and   $(document).ready(function(){ get_event({type:'load', use
[12:54:23] <otiuk> danheberden, is there any reason why calling to .prop('class','hide') (class is called hide) wouldn't work if called more than once?
[12:57:10] <otiuk> danheberden, just ended up using .hide() and show() way more efficient than setting classes haha
[12:59:11] <chovy> i'm using .on('click', function(){ bar(foo, bar) });
[12:59:18] <chovy> how do i remove that with .off() ?
[12:59:31] <chovy> since its anonymous
[13:00:58] <pachet> chovy: use namespaceing
[13:01:06] <pachet> er, s/namespaceing/namespacing
[13:01:23] <pachet> .on('click.foo', function(){}).off('click.foo')
[13:07:55] <clone1018> Does anyone know of a plugin that'll allow me to overlay rotate, resize and moveable stickers over an image?
[13:08:26] <Malgorath> Hello, I'm using jquery to filter a table from an textbox as the person types: $('input#search').quicksearch('table tbody tr'); but I'd also like to update the number of rows found in a <span id="count"></span> is this possible?
[13:09:52] <onerope>  develop a mobile app for Target, $75,000 1st place, $10,000 to 2nd through 8th place http://www.fastcolabs.com/3006487/accelerator/colabs-and-target-75000-retail-accelerator-starts-here
[13:10:21] <Malgorath> like I found var rowCount = $('#mytable >tbody >tr').length; but where would I add this so it was updated..
[13:20:48] <jokke> hey if i call find on an object $(identifier).find('.findme') and then call hover() on that, how can i reference the found dom element inside the hover params?
[13:21:19] <jokke> or is it just this?
[13:21:47] <systemfault> jokke: Just "this"
[13:22:06] <jokke> oh ok
[13:22:09] <jokke> thanks
[13:22:10] <systemfault> jokke: You could need to jQuery-ify it
[13:22:23] <systemfault> Because "this" is a DOM Node
[13:22:37] <jokke> yup
[13:22:43] <jokke> as in $(this)
[13:23:59] <jokke> hm.. doesn't work
[13:24:16] <jokke> here's what i'm trying to do
[13:24:18] <systemfault> jokke: Do you have a live testcase or somethingÉ
[13:24:19] <jokke> $('.menu').find('li').hover(function() {$(this).find('.dropdown').slideDown();}, function() {$(this).find('.dropdown').stop().slideUp();});
[13:24:45] <jokke> i can make one
[13:24:48] <systemfault> Looks food to me.
[13:24:54] <pachet> mm, food
[13:24:59] <systemfault> Yeah, haha
[13:25:10] <systemfault> Just ate a sandwich.. it shows
[13:25:22] <Wolf_22> Would this snippet give me the number of links inside a div?: $('div a').length
[13:25:24] <Wolf_22> If so, the API page seems to be misleading. The api.jquery.com/length page says in the description, "The number of elements in the jQuery object." Taking my code above into account, the object in this case is actually the div, yes?
[13:25:59] <AusME> Newbie question: So, $() can accept any arguments?
[13:25:59] <pachet> Wolf_22: no
[13:26:10] <pachet> Wolf_22: the object is the collection of a's
[13:26:14] <systemfault> AusME: Define.. "any"?
[13:26:22] <pachet> like an array with helper methods
[13:26:54] <Wolf_22> pachet: Ah. That makes sense. I guess when I read that description, I wasn't being abstract enough to get their explanation.
[13:26:58] <pachet> Wolf_22: moreover that'll give you the number of anchors that exist in any div
[13:27:12] <AusME> $(function()
[13:27:12] <AusME> shows that $() can accept type functions without any idea what the function is. Hence my jump to, any (meaning anything with any quantity).
[13:27:15] <pachet> so <div><a /></div><div><a /></div> -> 2
[13:27:39] <Wolf_22> pachet: So if I'm trying to get the number of anchors in 1 particular div, I either have to reference it directly by something like class or else loop through all the divs, etc.?
[13:27:39] <pachet> AusME: i mean
[13:27:52] <pachet> im sure you can get it to throw an error somehow
[13:27:57] <pachet> but $ does a LOT of ducktyping
[13:27:59] <pachet> in various places
[13:28:05] <pachet> to determine what it is you're trying to do
[13:28:10] <shoelessone> Anybody have any experience trouble shooting issues involving libraries/plugins that you've inlcuded not being accessible?
[13:28:12] <pachet> fuzzy logic is king here
[13:28:20] <pachet> well,
[13:28:22] <pachet> sort of
[13:28:24] <shoelessone> Basically I think what might be happening is jquery is being included twice or something
[13:28:53] <pachet> Wolf_22: jquery allows you to specify what div you want by index
[13:28:55] <shoelessone> So a library that I've included in my JS is not accessible
[13:29:01] <AusME> Thank you, pachet.
[13:29:09] <pachet> say you want the 3rd div on the page, $('div:eq(2) a')
[13:29:48] <Wolf_22> pachet: I've never seen "eq()" before... Nice. Thanks.
[13:30:53] <jtm> Can someone explain to me why doing: var $container = elem.parent().find(".parsley-container").clone(); then $container.removeAttr('id');  would NOT remove the attribute?
[13:31:10] <systemfault> jtm: $container is emptyÉ
[13:31:11] <systemfault> ?
[13:31:14] <jtm> Nope
[13:31:35] <systemfault> Because it should work.. :/
[13:31:45] <jtm> I do: alert($container.html()); afterwards (or console.log) and it still has both the id and class
[13:32:16] <Malgorath> http://pastie.org/6477150 <-- Error is at bottom.. can anyone help?
[13:32:31] <jtm> maybe I just need to wrap it with <ul></ul> and ignore the ul I am trying to remove from... I guess
[13:33:43] <jokke> systemfault: here's the live testcase: http://jsfiddle.net/ageZ3/
[13:34:49] <systemfault> Works here..
[13:35:06] <jokke> oh.. wait a sec
[13:35:07] <systemfault> http://jsfiddle.net/ageZ3/1/
[13:35:15] <systemfault> (I simply included jQuery)
[13:35:23] <jokke> right you are
[13:36:43] <Malgorath> systemfault: could you look at http://pastie.org/6477150 and maybe suggest what I'm doing wrong? I'm using the quicksearch jquery addon if you used that, if there is a better way to filter out my tables I'd be open to that also
[13:37:14] <shoelessone> anybody know how to tell an plugin to extend a no conflict version of jQuery?
[13:37:26] <systemfault> Malgorath: I never used that plugin, sorry… what version of jQuery do you use?
[13:37:26] <shoelessone> I have a situation (I think) where there are a bunch of different jquery versions being loaded
[13:37:39] <systemfault> Malgorath: Because there has been breaking changes in 1.9
[13:37:41] <shoelessone> and I think what's happenening is the plugin I need isn't accessible via jQuery or $
[13:37:47] <vraja> Hi, I'm trying to implement this code found here: http://papermashup.com/jquery-show-hide-plugin but the "hideText won't show. Can anyone help?

[13:38:45] <systemfault> Malgorath: Be sure that your plugin is compatible.
[13:38:52] <Malgorath> ah I see
[13:39:15] <vraja> manually using the code or downloading the plugin produces the same result...

[13:43:41] <vraja> NoiseEee: but you said it won't add it to page source?
[13:43:51] <Malgorath> would it be wiser to make my own function and do $("td").filter(function() { return $(this).text().indexOf("something") !== -1;}).parent().hide(); ?
[13:44:02] <NoiseEee> vraja: is jquery loaded?  $('h1').hasClass('new') gives you what in console?
[13:44:11] <NoiseEee> vraja: no, not to page source, but to firebugs view i think it does.
[13:45:03] <vraja> NoiseEee: I've got a query slider working on the same page, so jquery seems to be working
[13:45:21] <NoiseEee> vraja: either reproduce it not working in jsfiddle or we have to assume its working :)
[13:45:39] <vraja> NoiseEee: I don't know what jsfiddle is
[13:45:42] <vraja> XD
[13:46:02] <NoiseEee> vraja: http://jsfiddle.net/
[13:46:42] <vraja> NoiseEee: Running the command in console adds the class, but why won't it run on regular page load?
[13:47:32] <NoiseEee> vraja: probably because a) the element doesn't exist yet at page load (ie: your <script>s are in <head> and you're doing things before the DOM is ready)  or b) jQuery hasn't loaded yet "on page load"
[13:47:55] <vraja> NoiseEee: oh hmm, yes this script is in <head> can I put it in body?
[13:48:15] <NoiseEee> vraja: <script></script> should be before </body>
[13:49:07] <vraja> NoiseEee: between <head> and <body> ?
[13:50:28] <NoiseEee> vraja: no, at the bottom of your document before </body>
[13:50:43] <Guddu> The problem is being shown in this line
[13:50:44] <Guddu> var warehouse_input_node = $('<input id='warehouse_input_node'>').attr('type','hidden').val(data.warehouse);
[13:50:57] <vraja> NoiseEee: Oh I see, thanks
[13:51:03] <systemfault> Guddu: Of course it won't work...
[13:51:17] <systemfault> Guddu: escape your inner single quotes
[13:51:18] <Guddu> systemfault, Double quote issue?
[13:51:22] <NoiseEee> vraja: i mean, you can put it in <head> but its not best-practices and you'd have to use http://api.jquery.com/ready/
[13:51:31] <Guddu> systemfault, Thanks. . .
[13:51:49] <otiuk> is there any way to remove a class from any element in an object file if it exists?
[13:51:58] <NoiseEee> an object file?
[13:52:05] <systemfault> Guddu: To avoid that specific issue, I use single quotes for strings and I use double quotes inside them
[13:52:27] <Guddu> Thanks systemfault I will keep that in mind. I wil use double quotes inside.
[13:52:36] <otiuk> NoiseEee, sorry meant html file
[13:52:56] <NoiseEee> otiuk: no you only get to work on the current file/document.
[13:53:07] <NoiseEee> otiuk: or one in an iframe that respects SOP
[13:53:58] <otiuk> i have a list of navigation options.. and i want to remove the class that highlights the option from the old LI element
[13:54:15] <otiuk> i have it adding the select class to the clicked no problem
[13:54:24] <otiuk> but i want to remove it from what was selected
[13:55:11] <NoiseEee> otiuk:  $(specificUL).find('li').removeClass('highlight');  $(yourLI).addClass('highlight');
[13:55:19] <vraja> NoiseEee: Putting <script>$("h1").addClass("new");</script> before my </body> causes the site to load blank
[13:56:15] <NoiseEee> vraja: yeah thats not the issue, re-examine your code.
[13:57:44] <vraja> argh
[13:57:49] <vraja> :P
[13:57:50] <vraja> okay
[13:58:05] <otiuk> NoiseEee, nice.. another off chute question.. if the ul doesn't have an id, but it's the parent of both the LI that was clicked and the one that has the current highlight class .. is there a way to using .parent to specify the ul?
[13:58:25] <NoiseEee> otiuk: $(clickedLI).closest('ul')
[13:59:51] <vraja> goodness I didn't know this could be so troublesome
[13:59:58] <vraja> I think I just failed a job interview deadline XD
[13:59:59] <otiuk> so if the action that activates all of this is an anchor.. can you do $('.n_opt').closest('ul').find('li').removeClass('highlight'); ?
[14:00:06] <otiuk> NoiseEee, ^
[14:00:20] <NoiseEee> otiuk: sure, try it
[14:00:22] <otiuk> or is that just nonsense or stupid
[14:00:32] <NoiseEee> otiuk: its what chaining is all about
[14:00:52] <NoiseEee> otiuk: just make sure that if you write long chained things like that, that its easy to read/understand whats going on.
[14:01:18] <Guddu> Dear friends...I am using JQuery to generate dynamic table. My jquery code is at http://dpaste.com/1022093/ . . . for some reason, the resulting table HTML (shown at http://dpaste.com/1022094/ ) is wrong.  The <th></th> tags have nothing inside them despite that my code has <td> inside. Please guide.
[14:01:29] <otiuk> hah ok just reminds me of learning german.. how they just link words upon words hah
[14:02:24] <NoiseEee> Guddu: don't forget your <thead>
[14:02:38] <Guddu> Thanks NoiseEee Checking
[14:03:08] <otiuk> hah that's so sweet.. thanks much NoiseEee - i really appreciate it
[14:03:40] <NoiseEee> Guddu: also i'd think about doing table_structure.append('justTheHTMLStrings,notAJqueryObject')
[14:03:52] <NoiseEee> np otiuk good luck
[14:06:11] <Guddu> NoiseEee, u mean instead of  table_header.appendTo(table_structure); i should use table_structure.append(table_header.html()); ?
[14:06:41] <NoiseEee> table_structure.append('<tr><th><td>Cartones</td><td>Picktickets</td><td>Cartones en Salida</td><td>Picktickets en Salida</td></th></tr>')
[14:07:26] <Guddu> Oh ok
[14:07:48] <Guddu> NoiseEee, U mean no need to create a interim Jquery object.
[14:08:21] <vraja> NoiseEee: I have a plugin js file and there's the $(document).ready(function(){ in the HTML. How do I include both in JS fiddle? it just says I don't need it
[14:08:31] <NoiseEee> Guddu: correct
[14:09:15] <Guddu> Thanks for the tip noisee
[14:13:09] <zfly9> Hey guys, trying to put a class on the active slide in http://malsup.com/jquery/cycle/lite/, is it possible?
[14:15:37] <vraja> NoiseEee: can you give any tips to load on page load or after DOM is ready? basically to get the add class to fire
[14:19:19] <NoiseEee> vraja: just add $(function() { //addclass stuff here });
[14:19:47] <zfly9> anyone?
[14:20:50] <Guddu> Dear friends...I built the contents of a form dynamically using JQuery....For some reason, when the form is posted, there is no post data received on server side. Please guide. This is how the generated form looks like when i inspect in Chrome browser. http://dpaste.com/1022111/
[14:22:31] <CrossBrowser> hey guys
[14:23:02] <vraja> NoiseEee: Sorry to keep bothering you. I'm a bit fuzzy on the format you just posted. I have $(function("h1") {//.addClass ("new")}); but I can't image that's right.
[14:23:12] <vraja> imagine*
[14:23:28] <NoiseEee> vraja: $(function() { $('h1').addClass('new'); });
[14:23:42] <vraja> oh I see, thank you
[14:24:04] <vraja> NoiseEee: this would go directly in the HTML, not a plugin file?
[14:24:18] <NoiseEee> vraja: correct.
[14:24:42] <vraja> woot
[14:24:43] <vraja> it works
[14:24:51] <vraja> :D
[14:24:53] <vraja> you're the man
[14:26:40] <NoiseEee> vraja: do you understand why that works?
[14:26:47] <vraja> NoiseEee: no..
[14:27:03] <vraja> maybe because document.ready or whatever loads things before its ready?
[14:27:31] <w1pko> hello, anybody got lightbox2 working with jquery 1.9.1?
[14:28:37] <NoiseEee> vraja: $(function() {} );  is the equivalent of saying "when the dom has loaded, do the stuff inside the function".  your earlier problem was a result of you trying to change the class of a DOM element before it existed.   *everything* should be wrapped in there to ensure stuff works properly.
[14:28:44] <NoiseEee> s/everything/applicable stuff/
[14:31:36] <Guddu> NoiseEee, Could you please help me understand this problem?
[14:31:41] <Guddu> I built the contents of a form dynamically using JQuery....For some reason, when the form is posted, there is no post data received on server side. Please guide. This is how the generated form looks like when i inspect in Chrome browser. http://dpaste.com/1022111/
[14:31:50] <vraja> NoiseEee: than you for the explanation and time
[14:31:54] <vraja> thank*
[14:32:33] <NoiseEee> vraja: no prob.  Guddu, can't see anything wrong with that offhand.
[14:32:43] <NoiseEee> http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide1 @ guddu
[14:32:48] <NoiseEee> im off home.  bye folks.
[14:32:56] <Guddu> Thanks NoiseEee
[14:40:42] <naeluh> hi everyone !!!
[14:48:26] <DyeA> If I write a listener handler to event.preventDefault() and then I return true out of the handler what will happen? Will the default event fire or will I overwrite it or?
[14:48:51] <jaagr> yo
[14:50:11] <naeluh> anyone ever use zoomooz plugin?
[14:50:42] <vraja> NoiseEee: do you have any time to help me with  a query button issue?
[15:01:56] <aberrant> can someone help me with .post?
[15:02:47] <aberrant> I'm basically just trying to turn an anchor into a submit with some fixed data (it's a state-changer so I don't want to use GET).
[15:03:30] <aberrant> and this is what I'm calling, but it doesn't seem to do what I want:
[15:03:31] <aberrant> $.post("{% url 'delete_rule' %}", {index: $(this).attr('id')});
[15:03:57] <aberrant> the stuff in the {% %} is template expansion - it replaces it with a fixed URL.
[15:07:17] <zfly9> anyone?
[15:07:23] <Voting> $(".keypress").keyup(function (key) { alert(key.which) });   <- I'm trying to figure out how to capture key presses when the focus is NOT on a text field or other input widget. I want to allow the user to move from application item to another application item and run my application from the keyboard as much as possible... How do I allow for that?
[15:07:29] <zfly9> Hey guys, trying to put a class on the active slide in http://malsup.com/jquery/cycle/lite/, is it possible?
[15:08:30] <slash_nick> Voting: bind the keyup event to window... unbind it when focus is given to an input/select/textarea type element... rebind it when blur ?
[15:09:29] <Voting> slash_nick: How do I bind the even to the window?
[15:10:10] <slash_nick> Voting: $(window).bind("keyup", function(){});
[15:10:33] <Voting> slash_nick: I'll try that! Tx!!!
[15:10:54] <slash_nick> Also $(window).unbind("keyup") when you want to stop listening
[15:11:20] <Voting> slash_nick: tx!
[15:28:31] <jaagr> sup?
[15:31:49] <shoelessone> anybody able to recommend a plugin for jquery that will help me create a fixed scroll position navigation?
[15:32:00] <shoelessone> i.e. as you scroll down the page the nav changes to reflect your position
[15:40:46] <Guddu> Is the themeroller site down?
[15:46:33] <gordian> hey guys, how can i make this animation loop through each index of newItems[] ?
[15:46:34] <gordian> http://jsfiddle.net/jEzpy/
[15:48:01] <vraja> Can anyone please help me turn this button into an image with the same functionality? http://jsfiddle.net/robinparduez/rAxAf/
[15:53:20] <zfly9> Hey guys, trying to put a class on the active slide in http://malsup.com/jquery/cycle/lite/, is it possible?
[15:54:09] <aaronmcadam> zfly9: the full version has a full callback suite, try that
[15:59:25] <zfly9> aaronmcadam, how do I use that?
[15:59:34] <scotdb1> I've got rows from a database coming back into a datatable.   First column is the key of the row (ID).   I want to offer three actions and currently have three columns containing these.  (actions are "Edit", "Approve", "Decline").   What I'd like is when I hover over the ID I get a little vertical menu offering these options.   Thoughts ?
[16:00:15] <aaronmcadam> zfly9: just like any other callback, when initialising the plugin, set the callback key value to a function...
[16:00:45] <zfly9> aaroncadam damn, very new to this.. was hoping to use addCss or something that I'm familiar with
[16:01:11] <aaronmcadam> zfly9: callbacks are what you want. easy to implement
[16:01:42] <aaronmcadam> there's plenty of examples on the plugin's site
[16:03:03] <gordian> zfly9: there are other lite jquery slideshows that already have an active class if you can't be bothered to learn
[16:03:20] <jokke> hey, i'm trying to set .click() functions in a for loop. The function depends on the running variable i. Problem is, the function "updates" with every change of i so at the end of the loop all click() functions are the same. Do you know what i mean?
[16:04:31] <aaronmcadam> hah yeah
[16:04:38] <aaronmcadam> easy trap to fall into. you're doing it wrong
[16:04:46] <systemfault> jokke: http://www.mennovanslooten.nl/blog/post/62
[16:04:49] <aaronmcadam> you want to be using $.fn.on
[16:05:04] <aaronmcadam> and it's a better pattern to add a data attribute to the element
[16:05:20] <aaronmcadam> and then use the callback function to retrieve that variable with $.data
[16:05:57] <aaronmcadam> yucky
[16:07:48] <scotdb1> I guess what I'm trying to achieve is similar to the Gmail functionality when you hover over a contact at the left hand side of the screen (but much simpler)
[16:17:09] <djshotglass> possible to send a quick ajax when a user closes a window?
[16:17:38] <systemfault> I only got it with sync ajax
[16:17:45] <coldhead> gross
[16:17:57] <martisj> gmorning all
[16:18:32] <systemfault> coldhead: That's how onbeforeunload works… you need to block it or else the page changes..
[16:18:42] <djshotglass> systemfault was that directed at me?
[16:18:48] <systemfault> djshotglass: Yeah
[16:18:56] <coldhead> onbeforeunload is EVIL
[16:18:58] <aaairc> i want to create an website that helps bar and club owners create custom youtube playlists to play in their respective venues. does anyone know if its actually legal for bar and club owners to play youtube videos in their establishments?
[16:19:02] <systemfault> coldhead: Totally agree...
[16:19:18] <coldhead> lol aaairc
[16:19:30] <djshotglass> so i do async: false?
[16:19:44] <systemfault> djshotglass: That's how I did it in the past...
[16:19:53] <aaairc> coldhead: laughing because i asked the question here? i figured so many people are in this room someone might know the answer.
[16:20:27] <djshotglass> what event did you use
[16:20:51] <systemfault> djshotglass: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/window.onbeforeunload
[16:21:48] <djshotglass> hmm
[16:22:01] <systemfault> I guess it would be $(window).on('beforeunload', function() {}); with jQuery… didn't try it.
[16:22:37] <djshotglass> cheers
[16:23:41] <Jackjackw> guys any of you able to tell me why jQuery.scrollwheel.js doesnt work in the latest firefox/nightly.... but works just fine in chrome?
[16:26:11] <tw2113> got a demo link i could try with it Jackjackw ?
[16:26:16] <tw2113> i can fire up nightly quick
[16:36:24] <tw2113> Jackjackw, i don't see scrollwheel.js loaded
[16:36:42] <tw2113> just jQuery.js and jQuery.mousewheel.js
[16:39:53] <arl> I have a quick question about when to call .on() in relation to the start of an .animate(), as in this example: http://jsfiddle.net/jU6LQ/8/
[16:40:04] <vraja> I could really use some help turning a query slider link/text into an image. Could anyone help? I've been trying for hours with no success.
[16:40:46] <arl> Basically, I'm trying to have multiple 'balls' come at the screen with an alert as to how long since the ball appeared (animation started)
[16:40:58] <tw2113> wrap an image tag in the link vraja
[16:41:57] <shoky> vraja: what's the issue
[16:44:19] <vraja> shaky, tw2113, I was trying it a few different ways. Using the code here for example: http://papermashup.com/jquery-show-hide-plugin
[16:45:14] <vraja> tw2113: if I have <a class="show_hide" href="#" rel="#slidingDiv">View</a> where would the image go
[16:45:25] <tw2113> in place of "view"
[16:45:54] <vraja> the problem is I have to do this with css sprites, so 2 images in one
[16:46:10] <tw2113> then css backgrounds
[16:46:21] <vraja> in the jquery?
[16:46:25] <tw2113> in the css
[16:46:29] <vraja> okay
[16:47:08] <tw2113> use the class and/or rel values for selectors
[16:47:14] <tw2113> or if you can add more, use whatever
[16:48:19] <vraja> hmm
[16:48:30] <vraja> what if I wanted to have text + the image?
[16:48:37] <vraja> because the text changes on open/close
[16:48:48] <tw2113> then you'd have to adjust padding on the link
[16:48:57] <tw2113> that way you could move the text around and away from being over the image
[16:49:11] <vraja> well I want the text in the middle of the image
[16:49:34] <tw2113> then position the image at 50% horizontally and however much vertically
[16:49:51] <tw2113> i guarantee it's possible, you may just have to tinker with css properties
[16:50:46] <vraja> If I've inserted the image in the jquery/html area though, how I can use css positioning on it?
[16:50:56] <gordian> hey guys, can anyone help me figure out why the new LIs that come in at the bottom of the list all show as 'undefined'? http://jsfiddle.net/jEzpy/5/
[16:50:56] <vraja> means, offsets
[16:50:59] <vraja> like -200px etc
[16:51:16] <tw2113> the same way you would in a different selector?
[16:51:29] <tw2113> and with plain css
[16:52:12] <vraja> hem, I guess maybe I'm over thinking it
[16:52:17] <gordian> i just want the new LIs to be newItems[]
[16:53:07] <gordian> not even a bloody console error for some guidance
[16:53:35] <vraja> hrm
[16:53:44] <shoky> gordian: first of all,  you need < newItems.length  not <=
[16:53:54] <vraja> I guess I'm confused because I can't set a hover state with an image offset because the image is directly inserted into the jquery
[16:53:59] <vraja> and it won't show via css
[16:54:12] <shoky> gordian: but more importantly, by the time the setTimeout callback is called, the loop is already finished, so i will be at the end
[16:54:54] <gordian> shoky: i see
[16:55:02] <shoky> gordian: you need to give a local function scope to the loop body, using $.each is a simple way to do it:  http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/jEzpy/6/
[16:55:14] <tw2113> vraja, no it'd be directly inserted into the dom element
[16:55:39] <tw2113> and you have a hover state for the <a> tag
[16:55:48] <tw2113> that you can move the background position on
[16:56:14] <gordian> shoky: the reason i used <= is becase ultimately it needs to be on a continuous loop
[16:56:28] <gordian> so was going to say if (i == length) i = 0
[16:57:04] <vraja> background-position doesn't seem to do anything on this
[16:57:13] <tw2113> then you're doing something wrong
[16:57:56] <vraja> no doubt
[16:57:59] <vraja> I just don't know what
[16:58:18] <tw2113> and unless you provide a fiddle, i couldn't tell ya
[16:58:28] <tw2113> or some sort of example
[16:58:45] <vraja> okay
[16:59:56] <vraja> here
[16:59:58] <vraja> I'm using this: http://jsfiddle.net/robinparduez/rAxAf/
[17:00:17] <vraja> minus the button css because I want an image
[17:00:26] <vraja> but putting a background image on button does nothing in css
[17:01:11] <gordian> vraja: how are you adding the background-image?
[17:01:18] <vraja> css
[17:01:20] <tw2113> what button
[17:01:37] <gordian> tw2113: it's not actually a button, it's a .button
[17:01:47] <tw2113> ah, i see where it is
[17:01:50] <tw2113> in the js panel
[17:02:03] <vraja> ah well technically #example1 but it has a class of button
[17:02:22] <vraja> so doing .button on that shows in firebug as valid  and finding the image, but nothing shows on my page
[17:02:43] <vraja> like firebug says <a id="open-press1" class="button" href="#">
[17:02:51] <vraja> (I changed example1 to press1)
[17:03:03] <tw2113> http://jsfiddle.net/rAxAf/879/
[17:03:29] <vraja> weirdness, it didn't work for me
[17:03:31] <vraja> will try again
[17:03:56] <tw2113> probably didn't have the right css
[17:04:20] <vraja> well firebug said I did XD
[17:04:28] <tw2113> you think it id
[17:04:30] <tw2113> did*
[17:04:40] <shoky> gordian:  you'll find it simpler with a function that you keep scheduling the next run of , instead of doing many setTimeout's in advance
[17:05:01] <gordian> it sounds much easier
[17:05:10] <shoky> gordian:  e.g. more like  http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/jEzpy/7/
[17:05:17] <tw2113> such a dilemma...what do i eat tonight
[17:06:19] <coldhead> pepperoni hot pockets
[17:06:24] <coldhead> to honour the new pope
[17:06:28] <gordian> damn, thanks shoky
[17:06:46] <gordian> that's exactly what i needed
[17:07:01] <shoky> yey
[17:07:04] <gordian> i've been making this damn animation all day and that is the finishing touch!
[17:07:07] <tw2113> oh yeah that pope stuff was today or something
[17:08:06] <tw2113> regardless, i need to get out of the house for at least a few minutes
[17:08:43] <coldhead> we'll try to carry on without you
[17:09:00] <tw2113> don't make the job so easy now
[17:09:05] <vraja> tw2113: thanks a lot
[17:09:16] <vraja> this is working, my image is just oddly positioning so its not showing

[17:29:43] <vraja> tw3113: still here?
[17:29:57] <vraja> I've got it working, but can't get a hover/active state going :P
[17:30:02] <vraja> otherwise I'm golden
[17:30:14] <vraja> the link is just a # because its a slider to reveal more content
[17:35:11] <vraja> okay, got the close thing to do an image switch, but still no hover
[17:43:30] <coldhead> and the orphists' plight / stimulated no one

[18:14:34] <gordian> shoky: you still here?
[18:15:03] <gordian> i've never seen the mod operator used like that and it's blowing my mind
[18:16:14] <gordian> also didn't know that when the divisor > dividend then == divisor
[18:23:47] <gordian> anyone know why this only animates once instead of continuously? http://jsfiddle.net/jEzpy/8/
[18:25:58] <anew> hey guys, is there anyway to save a user click with jquery... but then how would you know that specific user did the click? ip address ?
[18:32:42] <Guddu> gordian, Does this line seem ok to you?
[18:32:43] <Guddu> nextPush( (i + 1) % theArray.length );
[18:34:46] <Guddu> Change it to nextPush( (i + 1) % theArray.length,theArray ); for repeated animation over theArray items
[18:34:56] <Guddu> gordian, ^
[18:35:09] <gordian> ahhhhaaaha
[18:35:12] <gordian> derp!
[18:35:15] <gordian> thanks Guddu
[18:35:40] <anew> can you save session data with jquery ?
[18:35:45] <anew> like ip/browser all that stuff
[18:35:46] <Guddu> No worries gordian . . . Today is my first day with JQuery....I am still learning. There are quite a few helpful folks here.
[18:36:03] <gordian> oh i know it
[18:36:16] <gordian> i've been working on this damn script all day and sometimes you just need an outisde pair of eyes
[18:36:25] <gordian> extremeley helpful mate, thanks so much
[18:36:26] <Guddu> :-)
[18:36:37] <Guddu> No worries mate....Cheers...Until later

[18:59:36] <blackxored> Question
[18:59:54] <blackxored> Does a contenteditable=false anchor tag inside a contenteditable div triggers keydown or keyup?
[19:00:16] <anew> so guys... can i detect with jquery if an element is present on page ?
[19:00:36] <blackxored> anew: $(selector).length? ;)
[19:01:01] <anew> hmmm
[19:01:23] <anew> can u detect if a source has been loaded that was not loaded before? a css source ?
[19:02:22] <blackxored> anew: a source
[19:02:25] <blackxored> ??
[19:02:44] <anew> i'm trying to detect if there is a change in css on this page, wait let me get the exact css
[19:02:46] <blackxored> guys, does anybody know about the editable question, does it trigger keydown (i'm interested in deletion)
[19:08:01] <anew> ok
[19:08:08] <anew> blackxored
[19:08:16] <anew> can i detect when the height of a span changes that does not have an id
[19:09:19] <coldhead> anew: http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-resize-plugin/
[19:09:37] <blackxored> anew: I was going to suggest a plugin for position/resizing
[19:10:08] <anew> cool let me bookmark this i'm dead
[19:10:09] <ShawnRisk> I want to know why the video player below the slideshow on this page: ecosanity.org is not displaying correctly?  This was working just recently but now broken.  All I see in the console is this error: TypeError: video.thumbnails is undefined on this line var imgurl = video.thumbnails[0].url; in youtubebvideo.js (line 43).  Any ideas?
[19:19:17] <sethetter> Is there a way to get jquery to interpret an HTML string as just a string, instead of auto closing the element for me?
[19:19:43] <tw2113> sethetter, i think that's your browser doing that
[19:20:45] <sethetter> Ah damn. That makes sense.
[19:21:32] <sethetter> I'm trying to build a paginator by grabbing a certain amount of items that I'm paginating and then wrapping them in a .page div. Any suggestions?
[19:22:32] <tw2113> ?wrap
[19:22:39] <tw2113> bah, bot
[19:22:42] <tw2113> http://api.jquery.com/wrap/
[19:22:45] <ShawnRisk> tw2113: hi
[19:23:17] <tw2113> yo
[19:24:01] <ShawnRisk> tw2113: did you see my issue?
[19:24:25] <sethetter> tw2113: That just wraps each element individually doesn't it?
[19:24:40] <tw2113> you don't have a thumbnails method on your video var
[19:25:08] <tw2113> sethetter, i imagine use it once and pass in 1 thing, it would be wrapped once
[19:26:08] <ShawnRisk> tw2113: how do I get a thumbanails method on my video var?
[19:26:28] <tw2113> i dunno what's assigning the video far
[19:26:35] <tw2113> it'd be something defined in there
[19:28:48] <ShawnRisk> tw2113: right, I am not sure either, give me a sec to figure this out need to switch computers.
[19:31:43] <ap> I'm having a hard time figuring out the asynchronous nature of setTimeout ... because of the callbacks, shouldn't this execute in order, despite the timeouts? http://jsfiddle.net/jU6LQ/16/
[19:33:20] <coldhead> ap: setTimeout(callback(),timeToWait);
[19:33:26] <coldhead> should be setTimeout(callback,timeToWait);
[19:33:40] <coldhead> you are calling callback immediately and using whatever it returns as the argument to setTimeout
[19:33:52] <coldhead> you usually just want to pass a reference to the function, not call it immediately
[19:34:04] <coldhead> subtle but important distinction
[19:34:13] <coldhead> like a woman's love
[19:34:41] <ShawnRisk> back
[19:34:55] <zarac> .. to life..
[19:34:59] <zarac> back to reality..
[19:35:03] <zarac> *na na*
[19:36:14] <ShawnRisk> tw2113: did you look at the code?
[19:36:19] <coldhead> remember how there's that album called "eaten back to life"?
[19:36:21] <coldhead> best name ever
[19:36:34] <coldhead> also how it unconsciously evokes the rites of osiris
[19:36:36] <zarac> no i don't  : )
[19:36:43] <zarac> lol
[19:36:46] <zarac> scary
[19:37:42] <ShawnRisk> I thought the function createThumbnail which has video as one of the variables is defined on line 61, thumbnail: createThumbnail  is that right?
[19:38:29] <magixx256> i'm trying to select a jqueryui tab by clicking a link with a href=# and an onclick which calls a function, after i do stuff in the script i added $('#tabs').tabs('select', '3'); , however this is not switching me tabs
[19:39:22] <ap> coldhead: I really appreciate it
[19:39:43] <tw2113> ShawnRisk, where's createThumbnail defined?
[19:43:11] <naeluh> rock n roll
[19:44:22] <magixx256> $( ".selector" ).tabs({ active: 1 }); did not do anything
[19:45:20] <magixx256> neither did $( ".selector" ).tabs( "option", "active", 1 );
[19:45:59] <ShawnRisk> sorry my computer crashed
[19:46:06] <zarac> Is there a max traversal limit on foo.parent('.class')? It's not finding an element that is clearly there. If i log foo and manually follow the *.parentElement(s) attribute i find it.
[19:46:16] <ShawnRisk> tw2113: createThumbnail is defined here: function createThumbnail(jqe, video, options)
[19:47:15] <tw2113> hmm, dunno
[19:47:52] <ShawnRisk> tw2113: would you be able to look at the code?
[19:47:59] <tw2113> i can't see
[19:48:03] <magixx256> ok, i needed to have $( "#TABID" ).tabs( "option", "active", 3 ); for it to work
[19:48:09] <heshanh> hey guys, with the UI autocomplete when i set a remote datasource it sends the search term as 'term=aaa', is there way to change the name of the var 'term'
[19:48:11] <ShawnRisk> tw2113: what?
[19:48:30] <tw2113> :D
[19:48:43] <ShawnRisk> confusing me
[19:48:43] <tw2113> i could, but i can't guarantee having any idea
[19:48:53] <tw2113> it's a few joys of life i get
[19:48:57] <ShawnRisk> tw2113: no worries.
[19:49:29] <heshanh> nvm found it :D
[19:53:37] <zarac> GrrRRrr. I've been stuck with this bug for an hour now. I need a second set of eyes. Go to http://zarac.se:3000 > Press a "Seasons" button > Press a "not seen" button. > See console for strangeness. ( relevant code : http://zarac.se:3000/js/index.js row 81 ).
[19:53:50] <zarac> This should be trivial.
[19:54:03] <ShawnRisk> tw2113: let me know when you are done
[19:55:11] <tw2113> ?
[19:55:32] <ShawnRisk> tw2113: looking at the code
[19:55:38] <tw2113> what code
[19:55:56] <zarac> tw2113: My code. ; )
[19:56:12] <zarac> the on_episode_toggle_seen function : )
[19:56:18] <zarac> I'll give you an e-hi5.
[19:57:07] <tw2113> 404 Not Found - http://zarac.se:3000/show/null/episode/S01E01/toggleseen"
[19:57:33] <ShawnRisk> tw2113: this code: http://ecosanity.org/sites/all/themes/ecoSanity/js/youtubevideo.js I thought you were you were looking at line 44, 45, and 61?
[19:57:41] <tw2113> i never had a link to it
[19:57:50] <larzen> folks.. how does one deal with .on('mousewheel' <-- this doesnt seem to work... i have a div and the mousewheel event doesnt work
[19:58:14] <ShawnRisk> tw2113: oops, line 42, 43 and 61.  I thought you did, sorry.
[19:59:49] <tw2113> and what line is it saying the error occurs?
[20:00:17] <ShawnRisk> tw2113: line 43, var imgurl = video.thumbnails[0].url;
[20:00:22] <zarac> tw2113: Yes, that's the issue. That null should be the ID of the show. That's what i'm trying to retrieve from within the event handler with $(this).parent('.show.item'). But it's not finding it.
[20:01:08] <zarac> tw2113: *hi5* for taking a look : )
[20:03:40] <tw2113> dunno
[20:04:27] <ShawnRisk> nuts
[20:10:50] <micronix> I'm getting a weird behavior with jquery ui draggable. I have about 15 draggable divs and after moving them around, they are not draggable anymore. This doesn't happen in chrome. Anyone have an idea of how to go about figuring out what's going on?
[20:13:13] <defaultro> hey folks, in my $.ajax, I made the url to non existing domain name so it would fail. I also added error: function() .....  However, looks like it's not going inside error. I see in Firebug that the url in Net tab turns color red
[20:14:24] <zarac> Bah... I didn't read the documentation well enough (it is a bit ambigious). Should've used parent_s_().
[20:21:41] <defaultro> hmmm, I noticed that when $.ajax fails to connect, it halts the operation
[20:22:12] <systemfault> halts?
[20:22:15] <defaultro> yeah
[20:22:18] <systemfault> It should simply fail.
[20:22:21] <defaultro> here is what I am trying to do
[20:22:29] <defaultro> maybe you can give some suggestions
[20:23:07] <defaultro> i'm pulling a hash code from a server. It returns some hex value. Now, let's assume the webserver is down, I want the variable to default to string 'newest'
[20:24:04] <defaultro> I'm using ajax and on my error: function() {} I added hashcode = 'newest';
[20:24:24] <systemfault> Ok, and?
[20:24:40] <systemfault> I cannot see the issue so far
[20:24:43] <defaultro> but when I stepped over it, it actually works but after it's set hashcode to newest, javascript doesn't continue anymore
[20:24:56] <defaultro> it exits out
[20:25:07] <systemfault> It's ajax… you decide how it continues
[20:25:09] <defaultro> i have a console.log(hashcode) outside but it skips it
[20:25:16] <systemfault> Can I see the code?
[20:25:17] <defaultro> ph
[20:25:19] <defaultro> oh
[20:25:23] <defaultro> one sec, I'll make it available
[20:27:15] <defaultro> here it is
[20:27:33] <defaultro> http://pastie.org/6484595
[20:29:19] <systemfault> defaultro: It should print "undefined"
[20:29:34] <systemfault> Because ajax is asynchronous
[20:29:38] <defaultro> it's not printing anything
[20:30:11] <defaultro> and I still want the application to run since the value of hashcode will be set to newest
[20:30:36] <systemfault> defaultro: $.ajax is non-blocking so console.log(hashcode) should print undefined.. then a bit after, the error handler should trigger
[20:31:09] <systemfault> asynchronicity can be a pain to understand at the beginning
[20:31:10] <defaultro> wait, the undefined that you are saying is the console.log(hashcode)?
[20:31:17] <defaultro> yes, I got it
[20:31:36] <defaultro> if (hashcode == undefined) { hashcode == 'newest')
[20:31:39] <defaultro> }
[20:32:43] <systemfault> The execution is: 7 -> 9 ->  27 (waits for ajax to error) 19 -> 20 -> 21 -> 22
[20:33:18] <defaultro> it worked!
[20:33:19] <defaultro> :)
[20:33:26] <systemfault> Wonderful :)
[20:33:35] <defaultro> glad you reminded me of asynchronous
[20:33:49] <systemfault> You're welcome
[20:33:53] <defaultro> :)
[20:34:21] <defaultro> what if the server is alive and it took him 15 seconds to respond, what will happen?
[20:34:52] <defaultro> what's the ideal code for that? I don't want users to wait
[20:35:12] <defaultro> I like it to only wait for 3 seconds
[20:35:27] <defaultro> or maybe upto 5 seconds then default to 'newest
[20:35:36] <defaultro> how would ajax be coded?
[20:56:38] <Snerf> I amusing .draggable with helper:'clone' but when I drop, I use $(this).append($(ui.helper).clone())  , but the item is no longer draggable
[21:05:48] <defaultro> hey guys, i need your input. I think doing an ajax call to another server might affect performance since the js page where I have the ajax is always being retrieved. What would be an ideal way so that our code doesn't have to call an external server just for the hashcode?
[21:06:23] <defaultro> in php, we have a function called file. However, js is client side
[21:13:24] <techy> any channel to state computer problems? does anyone know ?
[21:23:17] <Guddu> Dear friends...is there a way to find out the root of this error in IE8? IE shows a error on left hand bottom and attached is the image with the details. http://imgur.com/UC4qtuH
[21:23:30] <Guddu> Appreciate your help on this.
[21:27:40] <Snerf> Guddu, load a NON min version of jquery, a lot easier to see the line error then
[21:27:53] <Guddu> Thanks Snerf I am on it.
[21:28:10] <Guddu> Snerf, This error is seen only in IE8. And not on Chrome or Firefox
[21:29:06] <Snerf> fine, but you need to narrow down what is erroring 1st :)
[21:29:22] <coldhead> hot Snerf && Guddu action
[21:29:23] * coldhead faps
[21:29:24] <Guddu> Sure. Downloading the non-min version now.
[21:34:14] <Guddu> Hi coldhead , details of error are as follows
[21:34:15] <Guddu> Message: This command is not supported. Line: 2358 , Char: 5 Code: 0
[21:35:46] <b1lly> nomnom
[21:35:58] <Snerf> Guddu, do what is on line 2358 of the js fle?
[21:36:15] <Guddu> Snerf, Yes...in my code I am doing this
[21:36:16] <Guddu> 			var warehouse_input_node = $('<input name="warehouse" id="id_warehouse">').attr('type','hidden').val(data.warehouse);
[21:36:48] <Snerf> Guddu, thats 2358 of the jquery file, I mean
[21:36:50] <Guddu> Line 2358 of that jquery file is setting of element attribute . . . . .elem.setAttribute( name, value + "" );
[21:37:18] <Guddu> Snerf, is setting of elemnt attribute that way not supported in JQUery for IE?
[21:38:01] <systemfault> IE doesn't like when you change the type attribute on form elements..
[21:38:07] <systemfault> It's known
[21:38:47] <Guddu> systemfault, Is there a alternate way of doing this?
[21:38:57] <systemfault> Guddu: Just add the type in the markup?
[21:39:15] <systemfault> The way you did with the id… and the name..
[21:40:30] <systemfault> IE doesn't like when you "change" the type of a input
[21:40:45] <systemfault> What you were doing was changing from type="text" to type="hidden"
[21:40:48] <Guddu> systemfault, Thanks this problem solved
[21:40:53] <systemfault> You're welcome :)
[21:40:54] <Guddu> :-)
[21:41:10] <b1lly> Guddu: you can always just .hide()
[21:41:29] <b1lly> or .css('display', 'none');
[21:41:48] <Guddu> Thanks b1lly Also serves my purpose
[21:42:04] <b1lly> instead of hidden
[21:44:46] <magixx256> how do I get something to float to the left or right in tabs? if i float it anyhwere it gets placed outside the tab
[21:46:05] <coldhead> a good fix is not to float things :)
[21:46:38] <magixx256> im trying to get two divs be beside eachother
[21:46:48] <magixx256> on left and right side
[21:46:55] <coldhead> display:inline ?
[21:47:17] <paulvd> why isnt float good?
[21:47:21] <coldhead> if you really must use float, try floating their containers
[21:47:33] <coldhead> because float messes with the layout of parents and grandparents
[21:47:38] <magixx256> external
[21:47:39] <coldhead> and you have to use clearfixes and so on
[21:47:41] <coldhead> it's a nightmare
[21:47:55] <paulvd> clearfixes handle it
[21:48:11] <paulvd> or overflow
[21:48:24] <coldhead> or avoid floats altogether
[21:48:32] <coldhead> EXCEPT when you want text to flow around an image
[21:48:52] <coldhead> that's the only float instance where i won't NECESSARILY break your fingers
[21:50:24] <guzzlefry> how do you do column layouts without floating?
[21:51:59] <coldhead> http://www.quirksmode.org/css/columns/
[21:52:28] <coldhead> basically the trick is to pretend that the latest opera is the only browser
[21:56:11] <paulvd> coldhead: its better to follow the css standards than to use "tricks" which can affect the design in the future heh
[21:56:11] <heshanh> Hey guys, im trying to format the autocomplete UI result set, how do i manually feed in html to the autocomplete? this is what ive got so far http://jsfiddle.net/n3wzg/
[21:56:35] <paulvd> 95% use floats
[21:57:20] <heshanh> im in the process of moving code from prototype to jQ and trying to use the same output from php and make it fit the autocomplete result
[21:59:04] <Guddu> Another issue in IE...I am adding a Text (<a> element) dynamically...Code is at http://dpaste.com/1022367/ . . lines 11,12 and 53,54 is where i add the a element...On Chrome it works fine...In IE the <a> element is missing. . . Upon inspecting the DOM, in IE i see this ( http://imgur.com/p2gOtOA,kArJPrQ ) while in Chrome  i see this ( http://imgur.com/XIjyLGZ )
[22:00:35] <coldhead> paulvd: 95% of my CSS problems are caused by other people (over)using floats
[22:00:49] <guzzlefry> floats make me...light-headed. :P
[22:01:07] <coldhead> so floaty
[22:02:17] <b1lly> Guddu: what is data.warehouse
[22:03:02] <Guddu> b1lly, That's a value that I am getting back from the server. It is a string. . . has a value of 012
[22:03:22] <b1lly> are you trying to make the string the link ?
[22:04:38] <b1lly> explain what your trying to do because
[22:04:42] <Guddu> b1lly, Yes....if i use <h1> instead of <a>, the issue still persist
[22:04:42] <b1lly> this is not pretty
[22:04:57] <coldhead> <3
[22:05:05] <b1lly> does <a id="warehouse_value_node"> exist?
[22:05:39] <Guddu> b1lly, I have one form where the user inputs the value. I do a ajax submit of the form and i refresh the form with the value entered by user and below i display the results obtained from server based on that input.
[22:05:58] <Guddu> For subsequent resubmit of that form as step 2 in the process.
[22:06:20] <b1lly> does that link exist in the page
[22:06:28] <Guddu> b1lly, That node exists in Chrome but in IE i see it as empty...Image is in http://imgur.com/p2gOtOA,kArJPrQ
[22:06:28] <b1lly> or are you trying to append it dynamically
[22:07:08] <Guddu> b1lly, Append dynamically...as on line 11,12 of http://dpaste.com/1022367/
[22:07:20] <b1lly> your pointing me to 11,12 but 11,12 is terribly written
[22:07:32] <b1lly> your trying to append it to where in the document
[22:08:30] <Guddu> b1lly, Trying to append it after the label with for attribute = id_warehouse
[22:08:42] <Guddu> And that's line 12
[22:09:39] <b1lly> $('#id_warehouse').after('<a id="warehouse_value_node">' + data.warehouse + '</a>');
[22:10:59] <Guddu> b1lly, Thanks trying that now
[22:18:18] <guzzlefry> Does Firefox offer some kind of strict mode for Javascript? That checks for undeclared variables and such?
[22:18:56] <Guddu> b1lly, Thanks. . . problem solved. Could you please tell me what was wrong about my previous code? Is that code not supported on IE?
[22:19:23] <b1lly> i'm suprised it even worked anywhere...
[22:19:49] <Guddu> b1lly, :-)
[22:20:38] <b1lly> thats a lie actually
[22:22:23] <b1lly> yeah, no clue how it worked anywhere
[22:22:42] <b1lly> its completely wrong
[22:25:16] <Guddu> b1lly, But what is wrong about it? So that I don't repeat that again
[22:28:48] <b1lly> http://api.jquery.com/html/#html2
[22:33:32] <Guddu> Thanks b1lly Helped me a lot
[22:33:35] <Guddu> Here is my new definition
[22:33:36] <Guddu> http://dpaste.com/1022375/
[22:34:39] <b1lly> great success
[22:35:04] <defaultro> hey guys, what's the best uglifier?
[22:35:47] <coldhead> defaultro: a mirror
[22:35:55] <defaultro> searching
[22:36:21] <coldhead> that was a cruel joke, defaultro
[22:36:26] <coldhead> what is wrong with UglifyJS?
[22:36:33] <vladikoff> UglifyJS2
[22:36:34] <defaultro> i know you were joking :)
[22:36:41] <defaultro> i haven't used any yet
[22:36:43] <coldhead> it wasn't even my joke
[22:36:50] <coldhead> some of the big kids put me up to it
[22:36:59] * coldhead glares at ryanneufeld admiringly
[22:37:00] <defaultro> so uglifyjs
[22:37:22] <coldhead> it's a popular choice, defaultro !
[22:37:24] <defaultro> and we can uglify offline right
[22:37:37] * ryanneufeld blushes at coldhead
[22:37:45] <coldhead> you'd have to ask someone like jdalton or matjas about which has the very fewest bytes
[22:37:53] <coldhead> because those guys care
[22:38:01] <ryanneufeld> uglifyjs and closure are pretty close
[22:38:02] <coldhead> i'm like "hey this is smaller than it was, case closed"
[22:38:02] <defaultro> k
[22:38:15] <ryanneufeld> I use closure in production
[22:38:32] <ryanneufeld> but I think uglify does other things too. like mangling names and stuff
[22:38:33] <b1lly> closure is very aggresive
[22:39:27] <defaultro> in what context billy?
[22:39:56] <ryanneufeld> b1lly: so is uglify, and it depends on your settings
[22:40:11] <ryanneufeld> closure can remove code that would never get executed
[22:40:15] <ryanneufeld> but it's risky
[22:54:45] <coldhead> <333
[23:13:47] <resting> erm…is the api site down? http://api.jquery.com/siblings/
[23:14:06] <coldhead> up for me bro
[23:58:17] <teitoklein01> i have a jquery.lightbox_me in my website . i set the showOverlay to false to remove the black background color and make it draggable. But when I drag it to some place scroll the screen to someplace it comes back to the center
[23:58:28] <teitoklein01> how am i going to do to prevent the auto-centering of the div?
