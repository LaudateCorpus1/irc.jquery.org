[06:49:39] <mcfdez87> Hello. I'm trying to center a div horizontally and vertically inside another div with jquery, but I not get result. ANy suggestion please? http://jsfiddle.net/or4dg4ag/
[08:24:35] <Sal> is there a way to know the offset of an element relative to one of its parents?
[10:03:01] <momomo> What is the best way to apply css using javascript nowadays ? e.css('color:red; position:absolute .... ') doesnt work ... is there a way to apply a bunch of things without having to make repeated calls ?
[10:05:16] <shoky> momomo:  .css({color: 'red', position: 'absolute'})
[10:05:40] <shoky> http://api.jquery.com/css/#css-properties
[10:06:16] <momomo> shoky, not good when you want to copy and paste from css.. however, it didn't help my problem with IScroll anyways ..
[10:06:48] <shoky> why would you copy and paste from css.. just leave it in the css and add a class
[10:07:16] <shoky> no idea what IScroll is
[10:08:22] <shoky> anyway if you really wanted to set its inline css.. you could just set its' style attribute with .attr
[10:08:25] <momomo> something to improve scrolling on mobile devices .. but is not able to calculate the height from my css, so I tried adding it to the css
[10:08:42] <momomo> *to the element
[10:09:54] <momomo> yes, that's a good idea
[10:10:04] <momomo> but that didn't help :(
[10:13:10] <momomo> actually it did, i was doing something crazy :p

[10:25:29] <mrbubbles> hello! i’m using $.ajax to grab some JSON data from a server. The JSON is valid and has a root element of chart, and when I do console.log(data.chart) I see the contents of that element. However, when I return data.chart for some reason it’s returning the root element too :( It worked when I used $.getJSON (but I need to use $.ajax to set auth headers) so I’m guessing that the JSON isn’t being correctly parsed,
[10:25:29] <mrbubbles> using parseJSON and that doesn’t seem to make a differnce
[10:25:37] <mrbubbles> Does anyone have any other ideas? Thanks :)
[10:43:18] <SirLagz> anyone know if jQuery Datatables can have text appended to the little sorting arrow on each column?
[10:45:55] <Horacsio> is it possible to tell jquery to disable an init command from a specific file?
[11:02:25] <shoky> mrbubbles  $.getJSON is just $.ajax({dataType: 'json', ...})
[11:02:55] <mrbubbles> Thanks shoky - I think the problem was that I was using the success callback rather than using a .then() promise. Working now though, thanks anyway.
[11:03:18] <shoky> yea, returning from the success callback doesn't do anything ;p
[11:04:04] <Kartagis> who can help me with http://drupal.stackexchange.com/questions/177808/multiple-checkboxes-in-an-ajax-calls ?
[11:11:35] <robhol> Kartagis: you should really code in English
[11:12:50] <Kartagis> robhol: there is nothing I can do about field names
[11:12:52] <robhol> also, I think you need [] for the name
[11:13:00] <Kartagis> unless you mean markup
[11:13:03] <robhol> name="kategodsagorfdjngdsrg[]"
[11:13:08] <robhol> nah, the api fields I guess
[11:13:13] <Kartagis> aye
[11:17:15] <Kartagis> robhol: nah, didn't work :S
[11:27:57] <abishek1> I am implementing the keyboard events using the arrows. I use $(document).bind('keydown'). how do I not invoke those events when the focus is on the required elements and not on others. for example when my focus is on a textbox, i want the arrow keys to work for the textbox and not the others.
[11:34:00] <Sal> hi, i'm using a class for an event trigger. for eample, i have many buttons that all do the same thing, so on all of them i just put a class 'actChangeColor' and then put a listener to that class
[11:34:22] <Sal> is this the right way to do it, or should i use a data or a rule?
[11:34:32] <Sal> role
[11:39:22] <durwasa> Without hitting the submit button if I want to get the contents of <input type='text'> to a different text box how can I do it ? can anyone please help ?
[11:39:59] <durwasa> tried $('id').val but not working
[11:40:14] <durwasa> .val() ; *
[11:41:40] <Sal> durwasa on the change event, targetText.val(sourceText.val())
[11:43:25] <durwasa> Sal, thankyou :) :)
[11:45:51] <abishek1> I am implementing the keyboard events using the arrows. I use $(document).bind('keydown'). how do I not invoke those events when the focus is on the required elements and not on others. for example when my focus is on a textbox, i want the arrow keys to work for the textbox and not the others.
[11:48:50] <durwasa> abishek1, I am very new to jQuery like its a week but I can think about a naive solution .. shall I ?
[11:50:14] <abishek1> sure
[11:50:51] <abishek1> this is what I have for now http://jsbin.com/duderuxoqi/edit?html,js,output
[11:50:51] <durwasa> other than text box for every other field disable keyup
[11:52:01] <durwasa> abishek1, its the least elegant solution like a brute force :P bt I couldn't think of a better solution ...
[11:52:50] <Sal> abishek1, use $(document).on('keydown', element, function)
[11:53:31] <Sal> that sets the event only for an element
[11:53:56] <abishek1> Sal, I tried that, when my focus is on a textbox and I use the arrow keys, the event is triggered for the element I mentioned on the event
[11:53:57] <Sal> but if you want all but one, then you need to check the event target
[11:54:46] <Sal> let me look at your jsbin
[11:55:15] <Sal> there's nothing in that bin
[11:56:20] <abishek1> Sal, here is the scenario, I am working on a canvas and they have a lot of design elements, when I select an element I want to be able to move around the element using the arrow keys, but there is a corresponding text box element. so if I focus the  mouse on the text area and use the cursor, the design element also moves
[11:57:33] <Sal> the desin element should have a fixed/movable state
[11:57:43] <Sal> like all drawing programs
[11:57:59] <Sal> when you click on an element, it gets 8 handlers around its area
[11:58:10] <Sal> and gets a movable state set
[11:58:33] <Sal> in the event handler, only element with movable state is moved
[11:58:50] <Sal> if none, event returns
[11:59:39] <Sal> or, you can play with focus
[11:59:54] <Sal> only element with focus can react on cursor keys
[12:00:29] <Sal> and that, at the same time, is a variable set global
[12:01:14] <Sal> have lo leave
[12:01:16] <Sal> ciao
[12:18:52] <codecutter> what have i missed? TypeError: env.target.children[0].id.subString is not a function
[12:19:34] <codecutter> var focusId = e.target.children[0].id.subString(0,6);
[12:26:41] <codecutter> anyone?
[13:01:52] * sergiu slaps Alina-malina around a bit with a large fishbot
[13:02:56] <sergiu> #jquery /join
[14:04:48] <codecutter> can you apply 'closest' on a class?
[14:06:52] <tocka> codecutter why dont you try it? :o
[14:32:02] <johnkeates> I have a rather strange undefined error all of a sudden, I have no clue how to debug it
[14:33:03] <johnkeates> anyone able to help me sort it out? It's on a live site and the engineer responsible for maintenance is gone for the weekend... I can rollback in a few hours, but until then, I'd love to find the cause if a sudden jquery-ui error
[14:37:18] <RabSimpson> hi folks, what's the best way to adjust the background position of an element on the x-axis?
[14:38:04] <BillCriswell> RabSimpson: background-position-x
[14:38:26] <RabSimpson> billcriswell: from what i've found, that isn't well supported
[14:39:14] <BillCriswell> Oh, then just background-position: Npx 0;
[14:44:00] <johnkeates> how do i find out why e.widget is undefined
[14:44:32] <arup_r> Jquery function to add a text inside <p> ?
[14:44:49] <arup_r> I am using html().. is it correct method for the purpose of mine ?
[14:45:18] <rcyr> For text, the correct method is .text('text')
[14:45:27] <rcyr> For html, it's .html('the html')
[14:46:32] <arup_r> yes, u r right
[14:52:46] <johnkeates> Anyone using blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload?

[16:13:24] <arup_r> I want to uncheck all the checkboxes which are checked? What is clean way to do it? $("#assets tbody tr td.select-checkbox input:checked")

[16:23:47] <arup_r> shoky_: thannks
[16:24:02] <arup_r> I am trying to click on a link using $("#share-cancel").trigger('click');
[16:24:08] <arup_r> but nothing is happening
[16:24:16] <arup_r> I tried from browser console also
[16:24:22] <arup_r> still no click happened
[16:25:00] <shoky_> why are you triggering a click
[16:25:03] <shoky_> just call a function
[16:25:23] <arup_r> How?
[16:25:30] <shoky_> function_name();
[16:25:33] <arup_r> doing http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5811122/how-to-trigger-a-click-on-a-link-using-jquery
[16:25:37] <shoky_> why?
[16:25:49] <arup_r> no idea, I googled and got it..
[16:26:02] <arup_r> barin is not working but too much work yet to finsh
[16:26:12] <shoky_> ok.. just call a function ;)
[16:26:24] <derstrom> Whatever the click event on #share-cancel does, have that logic in a separate function.
[16:26:24] <arup_r> shoky_: I don't get why my code didn't work
[16:26:38] <arup_r> ok
[16:26:39] <derstrom> Check the JavaScript section of your browser's dev tools. See if an error is listed.
[16:26:45] <arup_r> no error
[16:26:47] <shoky_> arup_r: if you want us to take a look, make a jsfiddle showing the problem
[16:26:57] <shoky_> or link to your site
[16:27:05] <arup_r> It is very complex, page is being rendered.
[16:27:13] <shoky_> that's not relevant to us :)
[16:27:18] <arup_r> so JSfiddle is not enough, but only I can show you the dom
[16:27:27] <shoky_> we need to see the problem
[16:37:26] <arup_r> not able to do.
[16:38:57] <arup_r> If i click manual on the cancel button it is working. If I do using Jquery nothing is happening..
[16:40:51] <shoky_> what does the button do
[16:43:59] <robhol> any good libraries for conversion between time zones?
[16:48:27] <arup_r> shoky_:  it is a link, if I click it does a request to a controller action
[16:48:36] <arup_r> and load the page
[16:49:20] <arup_r> now, I am subimitting a form using Ajax, and on sucsess trying to do the click using Jquery
[16:50:12] <shoky_> the link just opens a url?  you can change the url with window.location.replace(..)
[16:51:55] <arup_r> shoky_: here is small html http://codepen.io/aruprakshit/pen/jbaGav
[16:52:07] <arup_r> see the cancel.
[16:52:57] <shoky_> window.location.replace('/shares/cancel')  will open that url
[16:53:38] <arup_r> How to do page reload?
[16:54:07] <shoky_> reload?  window.location.reload()
[16:54:21] <shoky_> that doesn't change the url tho..
[16:55:01] <arup_r> ok not need.. just load will work, I will clear it from backend
[16:55:03] <arup_r> let me try
[16:57:26] <arup_r> shoky_: \o/
[17:23:03] <RonRichie> someone could help me with this please? https://jsfiddle.net/y7LmmLbr/1/
[17:24:17] <derekZero_> If I'm using jquery and jquery UI do I have to include both of those head tags that src them or does one suffice?

[17:31:01] <ThePendulum> .on('error.dt') doesn't seem to do anything
[17:38:46] <SaKiKnin> hello
[17:39:14] <SaKiKnin> I am new in JQUERY
[17:39:53] <SaKiKnin> I ma suing GET method and it sends me [object HTMLInputElement]
[17:39:59] <SaKiKnin> in data
[17:40:58] <shoky_> SaKiKnin: show your code. it seems you are sending the input element object instead of its' value
[17:41:25] <SaKiKnin> wait, i will past it
[17:41:52] <shoky_> (not in the channel please)
[17:45:08] <derekZero_> Where can I find the html tag that srcs jquery ui?
[17:46:43] <SaKiKnin> shoky_: http://paste.ubuntu.com/12832071/
[17:46:46] <SaKiKnin> here it is
[17:52:52] <derekZero_> SaKiknin: Is that head tag srcing jquery UI, or is that the standard src for jquery?
[17:55:46] <SaKiKnin> derekZero_: standard src
[17:57:03] <shoky_> SaKiKnin:  $.ajax({..., success: postToPage});
[17:57:46] <shoky_> SaKiKnin:  or  $.ajax({...}).done(postToPage);
[17:58:06] <SaKiKnin> shoky_: nothing come up then
[17:58:23] <SaKiKnin> wait
[17:58:48] <shoky_> check your console for errors.  add an error handler to the $.ajax
[17:59:21] <shoky_> SaKiKnin: also don't use  jquery-latest.js
[17:59:30] <derekZero_> If I want a series of elements to slide and fade in onto a page when it loads, is it better to make each their own $(document).ready(function... or group them all under one?
[18:00:15] <shoky_> there's no reason really to ever have more than one document.ready handler
[18:01:03] <derekZero_> k
[18:17:48] <SaKiKnin> shoky_: it doesn't works again
[18:17:56] <SaKiKnin> which version should I use
[19:11:36] <SaKiKnin> shoky_: works
[19:11:46] <SaKiKnin> datatype: text
[19:12:00] <SaKiKnin> and version 1.7.2
