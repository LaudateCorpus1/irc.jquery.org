[01:04:59] <Jasein> in $.fn.something=function() { var jq=this; var elem=jq[0]; }    elem should be the html element shouldn't it?
[01:18:48] <robertmaxrees> i wouldn't use [0] in that case
[01:20:47] <robertmaxrees> Jasein are you trying to make a plugin?

[06:46:13] <mydog2> morn... new to query.. trying to test how to "removeClass" to get a class removed. I've been testing on a test/public site but can't figure out the issue..
[06:47:01] <mydog2> i can seem to verify the class exists..
[06:47:22] <mydog2> this works.. as it returns the multi class --- var aa=$('div.page-sidebar-wrapper.noprint').find('.start.active').attr('class');
[06:47:31] <mydog2> returns -- start active
[06:47:47] <mydog2> I'm trying to remove the "active" class.
[06:48:33] <mydog2> I would have thought..  aa=$('div.page-sidebar-wrapper.noprint').find('.start.active').removeClass('.active');
[06:48:44] <mydog2> should have worked.. it didn't
[06:49:17] <mydog2> neither did --- aa=$('div.page-sidebar-wrapper.noprint').find('.start.active').removeAttr('active');
[06:50:27] <mydog2> i verified the multi class def is in the html.. I verified that I can edit the html in the browser debug/inspector.. the class is there..
[06:50:43] <mydog2> any thoughts as to what I might be missing..
[06:51:47] <mydog2> given the site is user/login.. it's a test site.. i can give user/login to any/all..
[06:52:02] <mydog2> i'm pretty sure this is trivial but i'm not seeing it
[06:56:41] <thykka> mydog2, when passing a classname to removeClass, you should omit the .
[06:57:03] <thykka> i.e. removeClass('active')
[06:58:10] <thykka> can you verify that the .find returns all the results you're expecting?
[07:30:29] <mydog2> hi thykka -- the find works -- i did a test find prior to the testing with the removeClass..
[07:33:01] <thykka> mydog2, do you have multiple elements that match .start.active, or only one?
[07:36:21] <thykka> mydog2, There doesn't seem to be anything inherently wrong with that line
[07:36:24] <thykka>  https://jsfiddle.net/s8Ljptc1/
[07:38:34] <mydog2> ok.. this seems to work..  aa=$('div.page-sidebar-wrapper.noprint').find('.start.active').removeClass('active');
[07:38:42] <mydog2> may have been a typo
[13:35:18] <z1haze> anyone who uses https://jqueryvalidation.org/ I am having trouble with removing a 'custom' rule.. it just doesnt remove it when calling the remove method
[13:35:29] <z1haze> any built in method it will remove, but the custom ones fail to remove
[13:45:03] <robertmaxrees> z1haze if you share out an example of your code someone may know what the issue is :)
[13:45:33] <z1haze> i figured it out :)
[13:45:51] <robertmaxrees> awesome - what was it?
[13:47:32] <z1haze> when you add validation methods you specify a class that says whether or not that rule is active, and i guess if that class has any other handlers attached to it, it wont remove it
[13:47:56] <z1haze> or if it has been used anywhere else. i dunno i didnt really dig into it after i attempted to change the class used for the rule and it worked
[14:32:58] <bigDaddy01> hello?
[18:09:45] <z1haze> i have $creditCardInput.on('input', handleCreditCardInput); so this function doesnt take any arguments.. i want to call this function in the context of another callback change event.. is that possible or do i have to update the function to accept an argument?
[18:10:04] <robertmaxrees> .bind()
[18:10:13] <robertmaxrees> :)
[18:10:29] <z1haze> https://bpaste.net/show/ca13fade4fa8 cool, so it would just be handleCreditCardInput.bind(this)?
[18:10:44] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[18:10:50] <z1haze> awesome. first time using bind :D
[18:11:11] <robertmaxrees> :) native js has a .bind(), a .call(), and an .apply() that are useful for passing around context.
[18:11:56] <z1haze> yeah, believe it or not ive never used any of those
[18:12:03] <robertmaxrees> not surprising actually.
[18:12:04] <z1haze> and ive been doing this a while now :) heh
[18:12:14] <robertmaxrees> i know plenty of engineers that never touch it.
[18:12:26] <z1haze> does it make us less good?
[18:12:30] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[18:12:34] <z1haze> good deal
[18:12:37] <robertmaxrees> just means you have experience doing it differently.
[18:12:45] <z1haze> i like that
[18:12:45] <robertmaxrees> also: ot'
[18:13:06] <robertmaxrees> *it's hard to know about some of this stuff if you never read the entire language spec or all of MDN or if nobody ever told you.
[18:13:15] <robertmaxrees> woops
[18:14:00] <z1haze> so this bind. do i call my method like a function or is it myfunc.bind(this)?
[18:14:13] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_objects/Function/bind
[18:14:14] <robertmaxrees> :)
[18:14:18] <robertmaxrees> myfunc.bind(this)
[18:14:31] <z1haze> ok yeah
[18:14:38] <z1haze> i actually do remember use bind im some cases
[18:14:44] <z1haze> been a while
[18:36:10] <z1haze> robertmaxrees, so this bind thing isnt working. i am calling it like mentioned earlier handleCreditCardInput.bind(this);
[18:36:18] <z1haze> when debugging and stepping into that function it just steps over it
[18:36:19] <robertmaxrees> show me more in context?
[18:36:40] <z1haze> https://bpaste.net/show/c18502ce81ba
[18:37:07] <robertmaxrees> 2 things
[18:37:13] <robertmaxrees> 1: is handleCreditCardInput an arrow function?
[18:37:27] <z1haze> it isnt. i learned that lesson yesterday
[18:37:39] <z1haze> it works on my input listener
[18:37:41] <robertmaxrees> oh.
[18:37:42] <robertmaxrees> also:
[18:37:47] <robertmaxrees> you want .call() there.
[18:37:49] <robertmaxrees> not .bind()
[18:37:57] <z1haze> ah
[18:37:57] <robertmaxrees> bind returns a new function object with that set context.
[18:38:03] <z1haze> .call(this)?
[18:38:09] <robertmaxrees> .call() will call that function with that set context.
[18:38:10] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[18:38:38] <z1haze> cool that did it. thank you
[18:39:02] <robertmaxrees> yar
[18:39:18] <robertmaxrees> also: you could
[18:39:30] <robertmaxrees> *could instead pass the event object around, instead of setting context.
[18:39:45] <z1haze> yeah
[18:40:19] <robertmaxrees> which is technically a little more pure, but it depends on the prevalent style in the file.
[18:41:01] <z1haze> I tend to most use arrow functions, but i dunno i guess i just like $(this)
[18:41:16] <robertmaxrees> why for?
[18:41:44] <z1haze> well i think mostly because you dont have to worry about e.target vs e.currentTarget
[18:42:09] <robertmaxrees> imo you should worry about that :)
[18:42:11] <robertmaxrees> but fair enough.
[18:42:41] <z1haze> i have examples where a link has a click handler on it, but the text in the link is surrounde with a <u> or something like that
[18:42:41] <robertmaxrees> or you move that concern up to the calling function and just worry that the arg being passed is the element you want.
[18:42:48] <z1haze> then i get the <u> in the event and not the <a>
[22:54:54] <bigDaddee00> hello?
[23:13:46] <pavonia> Hello
