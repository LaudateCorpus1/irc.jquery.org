[00:15:32] <johhny> is there any good jquery treeView control I can use ?
[00:15:40] <johhny> need to create a windows-explorer style layout
[00:16:35] <samarjeet> johny, try https://github.com/samarjeet27/TreeViewJS
[00:16:41] <samarjeet> I recently wrote that
[00:17:00] <samarjeet> see the demo : http://samarjeet27.github.io/TreeViewJS
[00:18:32] <abailarri> Hello. I have two divs that when I click hover I add a class to this div with clikc() fuction. I posible to disable click in this div when It have a concret class?
[00:19:51] <lolmaus> abailarri: within your click callback, check the item for the class and return false if it has the class.
[00:20:35] <lolmaus> Hey samarjeet, i've checked out your demo and there are a lot of unwanted scrollbars. Are you aware of them?
[00:21:55] <prohobo> you can just css that stuff out
[00:24:31] <abailarri> lolmaus, http://jsfiddle.net/4zw2m4hg/3/
[00:27:48] <stangeland> anybody knows a tool i can use to test json webservices? A tool where i can basically enter a server ip, a service name, and key/value pairs and look at the return value ?
[00:28:56] <Erwat> stangeland: cant you just do that with simple requests?
[00:29:14] <stangeland> Erwat, from where?
[00:29:35] <Erwat> oh, good point
[00:34:28] <nathanbz> hi, I'm getting this error in ie8 TypeError: Object doesn't support property or method 'attachEvent'
[00:34:50] <nathanbz> I'm just trying to call $.get('/counter.php')
[00:35:02] <nathanbz> using jquery 1.11
[00:49:07] <lolmaus> abailarri: your code activates all buttons at once.
[00:49:17] <abailarri> lolmaus, I solved it :)
[01:08:18] <Mement> Any tip on how I can make this smaller? http://jsfiddle.net/xpaanzko/
[01:11:44] <Uhkis> lose the margin? :D
[01:15:14] <Cork> Mement: use a class
[01:16:07] <Cork> Mement: also don't you have a class to identify the items?
[01:16:27] <Cork> selecting multiple elements is best done with a class
[01:16:29] <Mement> Cork: It already has a class 'image-selector', but I only want the margins on this particular form and not all forms that has an image-selector in it.
[01:17:30] <Cork> Mement:
[01:17:30] <Cork> <Cork> Mement: use a class
[01:17:32] <Cork> opps
[01:17:35] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/xpaanzko/1/
[01:18:47] <Mement> Cork: Ah that looks good! That way I can only add the class in the specific div and not on all 'image-selector' classes.
[01:46:26] <prohobo> hey
[01:46:42] <prohobo> is there a way to make safe password fields using html5 + js?
[01:46:58] <prohobo> i have a password input that hides the password on the screen but not in the html source
[01:47:07] <prohobo> which kind of defeats the purpose of the password input
[01:47:30] <Cork> prohobo: don't input the old password
[01:47:54] <Cork> the input field is meant to be used for inputting a password not hiding it
[01:48:16] <Cork> so just send stars in the value field or something like that
[01:48:41] <prohobo> hmm
[01:48:44] <prohobo> okay ty
[01:49:34] <Uhkis> that first approach was like if ($('#pass').val() == 1234) window.location = secret.html :D
[01:50:06] <prohobo> well i mean
[01:50:28] <prohobo> whatever -_-
[02:23:02] <ThoMe> hiho

[03:25:34] <LucaS05> hi. i'm using the select 2 plugin, i've included it but i got "Uncaught TypeError: undefined is not a function" when i try to initialize a select with the select2 function
[04:18:15] * Omar- wipes channel's floor
[04:35:44] <compact> hi. I've got this: http://jsfiddle.net/w29gxmj8/2/ <-- how can i make it multiple the totalwieght result by 333?
[04:36:41] <maxvi> I do alert on onclick but it run twice on the page (( also I use jQuery how can I know why this happen?
[04:37:30] <sheepasdfghi> hi everbody
[04:39:20] <compact> ah got it
[04:39:46] <sheepasdfghi> hi guys, would say that creating a sticky footer with js/jquery is over-engineering ? thanks
[04:44:15] <Cork> sheepasdfghi: i would say it would be a bad choice today
[04:44:22] <Cork> just use position: fixed;
[04:44:39] <Cork> it is much more permanent and less buggy
[04:44:47] <sheepasdfghi> Cork: thanks. can you link to an example?
[04:44:49] <Cork> except in some mobile browsers
[04:45:12] <Uhkis> just remember to add some padding to your content wrapper
[04:45:20] <Cork> sheepasdfghi: not much to link css: footer { position: fixed; left: 0; right: 0; bottom: 0; }
[04:45:21] <Cork> done
[04:47:07] <sheepasdfghi> mhh
[04:49:44] <sheepasdfghi> should i use the html5 footer tag?
[04:49:50] <sheepasdfghi> pros and  cons of that?
[04:50:11] <Uhkis> what is this, #html ?
[04:50:31] <sheepasdfghi> ooops. yes. thanks. sorry.
[04:50:43] <Cork> sheepasdfghi: <footer> is safe enough to use
[04:50:50] <Cork> sheepasdfghi: as html is still html
[04:51:06] <Cork> if you need ie8 support you need a tiny bit of js specifically for it
[04:51:24] <Cork> sheepasdfghi: also i just used the tag name as a psudo holder
[04:51:28] <Cork> you can use any element you want
[04:52:01] <Cork> sheepasdfghi: also "html5" is marketing not a standard
[04:52:21] <Cork> if you want to talk about a specific tag talk about the tag not marketing
[04:52:37] <sheepasdfghi> i see.
[04:52:57] <Cork> for example h264 is html5 css3 animations is html5, javascript games is html5
[04:53:05] <Cork> 3d animations is html5
[04:53:13] <Cork> none of those is html
[04:54:21] <Uhkis> javascript games made in html5 apis is html5
[04:54:22] <Cork> random user can keep calling everything html5, but in a technical question keep it correct
[04:54:24] <Uhkis> fixed!
[04:54:47] <Cork> Uhkis: the problem is "html5 api" was largely invented in < 2003
[04:55:07] <Cork> so the numbering makes no sense
[04:55:18] <Uhkis> well that is just silly
[04:55:38] <Cork> basically before whatwg the html spec was... junk
[04:55:52] <Cork> and xhtml was the next big thing w3c pushed for
[04:56:12] <prohobo> we should make "html360"
[04:56:13] <Cork> then whatwg starting working on a standard that built on what browser actually did
[04:56:32] <Cork> instead of disattached random thinktank opinions
[04:56:46] <Cork> the workname was "html5"
[04:57:00] <Cork> then apple took it and rand with it as marketing for "we are cool"
[04:57:10] <Cork> and completely removed the meaning of the standard
[04:57:23] <Cork> so they removed the number and called it "html living standard"
[04:57:32] <Cork> and let marking play with "html5"
[04:57:40] <Cork> and today html5 means absolutely nothing
[04:57:47] <Cork> or as much as "web2.1"
[04:58:13] <Uhkis> "2.0" was so long ago that i'd call this moment 3.0
[04:58:45] <Cork> Uhkis: the interesting part is that the standard is adding new things constantly
[04:58:55] <Cork> so what was html5 isn't html5 anymore :)
[04:59:16] <Cork> i suspect <image> and the fetch api is include too now days
[04:59:17] <Uhkis> well we have these slow browser devs keeping it "html5" ;)
[05:15:12] <compact> http://pastebin.com/y7iyHdLx <---- any idea how i can get this to actin, so even if there is 2 "product_code" inputs
[05:16:04] <compact> I've tried $(':input.product_code').autocomplete({
[05:36:43] <MikeD_> is it better to assign a single handler with a switch() in the body for various control types or assign several handlers specific to each type?
[05:37:46] <tty> hi. i have a navigation bar on top with 10 <li> options. i have set overflow-y: hidden. how can i can put “ . . . “ at the end of the options when one or more <li>s are hidden?
[05:40:08] <tty> i have tried “if (menu.innerWidth()<1000){ … } but doesnt update on window resize
[05:41:09] <MikeD_> tty: that hack will be so fragile it's almost not worth building it (imo)
[05:41:45] <tty> MikeD_: how should i approach this?
[05:42:41] <MikeD_> do you have a public url to look at?
[05:44:27] <tty> no :/
[05:44:30] <tty> w8
[05:45:51] <bbclover> when you make an ajax calls what happens? You get a promise and then your code hangs around?
[05:47:03] <tty> MikeD_: this is part of the html http://pastebin.com/Xcxthddp and this is part of the css http://pastebin.com/vX7HKDpm
[05:47:21] <sacho_> bbclover, $.ajax() and related functions return a promise. At some point after(guaranteedly after your current function finishes executing), the promise will be resolved and any handlers you attached via .then/done/fail etc will be called
[05:48:05] <sacho_> bbclover, kind of how a setTimeout() works.
[05:48:39] <bbclover> oh so a promise is part of an ajax call?
[05:48:50] <bbclover> promises are a part of the javascript standard or something?
[05:49:57] <sacho_> no
[05:50:08] <sacho_> promises are a concept - jquery implements it
[05:50:45] <sacho_> there's also a standard implementation of promises in es6
[05:51:07] <compact> sacho_, any die how i can use autocomplete for multiple fields with the same id/name
[05:52:37] <compact> idea*
[05:57:37] <bbclover> well what about regular ajax calls in pure javascript like xmlhttprequest
[05:57:55] <bbclover> do they not get some object that doesn't have much associated with it until the call is completel
[06:02:15] <Cork> bbclover: in native js you create an xhr object
[06:02:28] <Cork> and you then attach the handlers for when the data comes back
[06:02:37] <Cork> much simlarly to how $.ajax works
[06:03:03] <bbclover> yeah, but there's no promise associated?
[06:03:28] <Cork> not really no
[06:03:30] <bbclover> i thought jquery ajax on declaration returns a promise, then when the request is done, whatever your call returns
[06:03:35] <Cork> it is more similar to how event works
[06:04:50] <Cork> var xhr = xmlHTTPRequest(); xhr.addEventListener('load', function(data) {}); ... xhr.send('POST');
[06:05:18] <Cork> opps
[06:05:31] <Cork> its xhr.open('POST', data); xhr.send();
[06:07:54] <sacho_> bbclover, you could write a wrapper around xhr that returns a promise(that's what jquery does)
[06:08:34] <ThePendulum> hmm, I have an element with overflow-y that I'd like to scroll down automatically. I got a full page scroll to work, but the same trick doesn't work for this element it seems
[06:09:18] <ThePendulum> $('#chatbox').scrollTop($('#chatbox').scrollHeight); is what I got atm
[06:09:40] <ThePendulum> http://memody.com:3000/chat.html
[06:11:34] <BillCriswell> .TheI think you want .scrollHeight(), not just .scrollHeight
[06:11:48] <ThePendulum> hmmm
[06:11:51] <Cork> no
[06:11:53] <BillCriswell> Wait, that's a property.
[06:11:58] <Cork> you want prop('scrollHeight')
[06:12:00] <ThePendulum> I didn't change anything about that since I replaced it from the body,html to the div
[06:12:03] <BillCriswell> I think you want .prop('scrollHeight') or [0].scrollHeight
[06:12:09] <Cork> yup
[06:12:23] <ThePendulum> ah I did have [0] before in there
[06:12:42] <Cork> ThePendulum: .prop does the same thing and is cleaner
[06:12:48] <ThePendulum> but apparently the whole is undefined
[06:12:58] <BillCriswell> Try adding the height of of chatbox as well.
[06:13:03] <BillCriswell> the whole?
[06:13:07] <ThePendulum> so $('#chatbox').scrollTop($('#chatbox').prop('scrollHeight'));
[06:13:17] <Cork> that should work
[06:13:36] <ThePendulum> it doesn't :(
[06:13:48] <ThePendulum> ah wait
[06:13:53] * ThePendulum is an idiot first class
[06:13:59] * ThePendulum and not id
[06:14:01] <ThePendulum> <div class="chatbox">
[06:14:20] <ThePendulum> welp, still doesn't work
[06:15:33] <ThePendulum> "Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'scrollHeight' of undefined"
[06:15:34] <ThePendulum> peculiar
[06:15:37] <Cork> ThePendulum: http://jsfiddle.net/df8jo7uz/
[06:16:01] <Cork> ThePendulum: did you change the selector in both the selections?
[06:16:07] <Cork> (btw store it in a variable instead)
[06:16:40] <ThePendulum> why would I do that? seems a bit verbose for just this occurance
[06:16:48] <ThePendulum> $('#chatbox').scrollTop($('#chatbox').prop('scrollHeight'));
[06:16:51] <ThePendulum> this is literally what I have
[06:17:04] <ThePendulum> <div class="chatbox" id="chatbox">
[06:17:18] <ThePendulum> perhaps I should try to scroll the ul for change
[06:17:24] <ThePendulum> not sure if that's any better, doubt it
[06:18:30] <BillCriswell> Does #chatbox have the overflow scroll on it?
[06:18:40] <ThePendulum> it does, the scrollbar shows up
[06:18:45] <ThePendulum> you can scroll manually
[06:18:52] <Cork> ThePendulum: this is also an option http://jsfiddle.net/df8jo7uz/1/
[06:19:06] <BillCriswell> http://jsbin.com/tataco/1/edit?css,js,output is my quick test and it works.
[06:19:09] <Cork> if you have multiple elements in the scroll view that is
[06:19:22] <Cork> BillCriswell: made one 4 minutes ago :)
[06:19:45] <ThePendulum> It worked when I set it to body
[06:19:59] <ThePendulum> I'd be damned that this is something simple again
[06:20:21] <Cork> lol the last example breaks jsfiddle XD
[06:20:21] <BillCriswell> Cork: I wanted to try it with the content changing haha
[06:20:45] <ThePendulum> I just noticed #chatbox doesn't take overflow-y, it's irresponsive to it
[06:20:56] <BillCriswell> "doesn't take" ?
[06:21:05] <ThePendulum> hmmm
[06:21:09] <lauwe> Hi guys. I'm running into a strange problem where a selector using a var doesn't want to play ball
[06:21:21] <Cork> ?code @ lauwe
[06:21:21] <b-ot> lauwe: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[06:21:28] <lauwe> https://jsfiddle.net/qdPAe/518/
[06:21:44] <lauwe> bit of a silly example..
[06:21:45] <ThePendulum> aaaand now it works
[06:21:58] <Cork> you have dots in you class names...
[06:22:04] <ThePendulum> ?
[06:22:05] <lauwe> yup :)
[06:22:13] <lauwe> and I'm escaping them
[06:22:15] <BillCriswell> Whyyyyy
[06:22:21] <ThePendulum> I had .chatbox and .messages properties weaved through eachother in the CSS
[06:22:24] <ThePendulum> wait what
[06:22:28] <ThePendulum> you're adding dots and then escape them?
[06:22:41] <lauwe> no, I'm escaping them
[06:22:59] <lauwe> so my 'manually escaped' version works
[06:23:08] <lauwe> but the str.replace version doesn't
[06:23:15] <Cork> lauwe: https://jsfiddle.net/qdPAe/519/
[06:23:25] <Cork> you over escaped the dot :)
[06:23:45] <Cork> \\ is for the parser not the selector
[06:23:54] <ThePendulum> hmmm
[06:24:00] <ThePendulum> I wish I could hide the scrollbar until it's necessary
[06:24:12] <lauwe> hah lol
[06:24:12] <Cork> ThePendulum: overflow-y: auto; ?
[06:24:21] <lauwe> that seems to be it indeed
[06:24:36] <ThePendulum> Cork: that tends to make the wrong choices for some reason
[06:24:38] <ThePendulum> let me try it again
[06:24:41] <BillCriswell> lauwe: Why are you doing this?
[06:24:54] <ThePendulum> oh, works better now
[06:25:11] <compact> http://jsfiddle.net/compact72/w29gxmj8/3/ <-- any idea how i can get the autocomplete for "product_code" to work in the new rows?
[06:25:12] <Cork> BillCriswell: cause he's a masochist?
[06:25:22] <Cork> why else would you have dots in your classes
[06:25:27] <BillCriswell> The only conclusion I can arrive at.
[06:25:37] <lauwe> BillCriswell: trying to locate something on a page which was generated from python-code
[06:26:04] <lauwe> the dot comes from some python class having a member
[06:27:05] <lauwe> could change the python/generated part now that I think of it
[06:27:06] <Cork> reminds me of this lovely example i wrote last year http://jsfiddle.net/w3qRm/2/
[06:27:32] <BillCriswell> lauwe: At a... person
[06:27:40] <lauwe> so I guess Cork was right, masochism
[06:27:46] <Cork> XD
[06:28:15] <BillCriswell> Cork: I'd pick a fight with someone if that showed up in some code I had to work on.
[06:28:33] <Cork> BillCriswell: lol me too
[06:28:54] <lauwe> that would have me fighting with myself
[06:28:56] <Cork> that example came up after a talk about... having spaces in ids i think
[06:29:01] <BillCriswell> Cork: How many browsers did you test that in?
[06:29:03] <BillCriswell> lauwe: Haha
[06:29:09] <Cork> BillCriswell: it is 100% supported
[06:29:15] <Cork> even lynx support it
[06:29:15] <BillCriswell> Damn.
[06:29:18] <MikeD_> i remember that conversation
[06:29:42] <lauwe> masochist and schizophrenic :D
[06:29:44] <BillCriswell> I deal with some pretty crazy html but never anything like that.
[06:29:48] <Cork> ya, my first reaction was "no way is that supported"
[06:29:52] <MikeD_> i recall that my response then (and now) was "omFg"
[06:30:05] <Cork> when i was told the nope, i wrote this to test how absurd this really was
[06:30:16] <Cork> ya, me too
[06:30:31] <Cork> that selector in the css is completely unreadable
[06:31:59] <ThePendulum> I should really add a join throttle
[06:32:03] <Cork> if i got this sent to be from a colleege i would question his continued employment
[06:32:19] <Cork> *to me from a
[06:33:32] <ThePendulum> I really need to clean up my CSS some time soon
[06:33:42] <Cork> lol don't we all?
[06:33:45] <ThePendulum> basically everything I created more than a week ago
[06:33:55] <ThePendulum> and I always will
[06:34:02] <ThePendulum> nothing is correct for more than a week with NodeJS I get the idea
[06:34:05] <Cork> its soo easy to get old unneeded things laying around in there as the project evolves
[06:34:12] <ThePendulum> yeah
[06:34:23] <Cork> scss makes it much easier to manage
[06:34:32] <Cork> but still hard to catch it all
[06:34:45] <dodzho> Any js editor which has editsource mode and does not filter embeded javascript? (I'm talking about contenteditable/iframe cms editor)
[06:34:46] <ThePendulum> ul li ul li .select:hover {} later fixed to .user li:hover {} both still exist idk
[06:35:07] <ThePendulum> some terrible positioning habits too
[06:35:12] <ThePendulum> no idea how else to do it though
[06:35:30] <ThePendulum> so slap an absolute on it and it'll stick
[06:36:10] <compact> http://jsfiddle.net/compact72/w29gxmj8/3/ <-- any idea how i can get the autocomplete for "product_code" to work in the new rows?
[06:36:45] <Cork> compact: you would have to reran it on every element as you add them
[06:36:55] <Cork> actually
[06:37:03] <BillCriswell> compact: lazy init!
[06:37:11] <Cork> you could try clone(true)
[06:37:16] <Cork> that MIGHT work
[06:38:00] <Cork> as a deep clone copies over the data from the old element
[06:38:17] <Cork> and might be enough to get autocomplete to work
[06:38:30] <BillCriswell> compact: I'd catch the respponse from that ajax call, then on focus of a product code input inside that table I'd set up auto completele.
[06:38:54] <Cork> BillCriswell: he clones the data on click
[06:38:58] <Cork> it isn't ajax based
[06:39:08] <Cork> (line 3)
[06:39:30] <BillCriswell> Oh.
[06:39:47] <BillCriswell> line 22 threw me off...
[06:40:26] <BillCriswell> but I still think $('table').on('focusin', '.product-code', function () { $(this).autocomplete(); }); could work wel here.
[06:40:48] <Cork> no cause you would initalize the autocomplete on every focus
[06:40:53] <Cork> instead of just when it is cloned
[06:40:54] <BillCriswell> one*
[06:41:14] <BillCriswell> not on my bad!
[06:42:26] <Cork> would have been nice if autocomplete could take a selector for the target like tooltip does
[06:42:31] <compact> so rerun on every elemtn
[06:42:35] <Cork> yes
[06:42:36] <compact> element*
[06:42:54] <Cork> compact: but try the clone(true) first
[06:42:56] <Cork> it might work
[06:43:07] <compact> in the autocomplete settings?
[06:43:19] <Cork> clone
[06:43:30] <Cork> ?api clone
[06:43:30] <b-ot> Cork: .clone(): Create a deep copy of the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/clone/
[06:43:39] <Cork> ( [withDataAndEvents ] ) <--
[06:44:20] <Cork> specially the withData part might get it working without rerunning it for every element
[06:44:26] <Cork> or it might break down completely
[06:44:52] <compact> hm, I've tried clone(true)
[06:44:59] <Cork> and no go?
[06:45:02] <compact> however, the autocomplete just uses the first input
[06:45:07] <compact> not the cloned one
[06:45:09] <Cork> ok, then there is only one option
[06:45:18] <Cork> you have to rerun it on every element
[06:45:40] <Cork> so after you've cloned the row select the element that should have the autocomplete
[06:45:50] <Cork> and run it on it again before attaching it to the page
[06:45:53] <compact> what function? sorry, just new to jQuery
[06:46:18] <Cork> function?
[06:46:33] <Cork> nut sure what you're talking about
[06:47:12] <compact> sorry, doing some google
[06:47:13] <Cork> compact: in line 4 you would have to add a $newTr.find('input[name...]').autocomplete(options)
[06:47:31] <Cork> before attaching the new elements to the page
[06:47:38] <Cork> its the only way to do it
[06:48:55] <compact> hm great, got it working
[06:49:00] <compact> now just need to make it get the row
[06:49:05] <compact> for when it grabs the result
[06:49:38] <Cork> compact: ya, you prob don't want to use ids like you do in the fiddle
[06:50:14] <compact> use names instead?
[06:50:36] <Cork> use elements in relation to the autocompleted field
[06:50:53] <Cork> $(this).closest('tr').find('input-field-class-or-name')
[06:52:38] <compact> so $(this).closest('tr').find('input-field-class-or-name') <--- you talking about instead of using ids etc?
[06:52:45] <Cork> yes
[06:53:21] <Cork> if you base it on elements on the same row as the autocomplete you don't have to have separate code for each row
[06:53:32] <Cork> or do wanky selector concating
[06:55:12] <compact> so something like: $(this).closest('tr').find('product_code').autocomplete({
[06:55:22] <Cork> no
[06:55:49] <compact> or when I'm setting the var?
[06:55:56] <compact> value*-
[06:56:10] <Cork> compact: after line 4 (in the fiddle)
[06:56:41] <Cork> you need $newTr.find('input[name="product_code"]').autocomplete(same_options_as_on_line_23);
[06:57:19] <Cork> the selection code -(line 29-35) on the other hand should base what it does on the element it runs from
[06:58:37] <Cork> though i might be reading too much into the code
[06:59:06] <Cork> what i mean is ex. $('#weight').val() => $(this).closest('tr').find('.freight-weight').val()
[06:59:22] <Cork> but that is a bit of assumption on what the code does from my part
[07:00:26] <compact> your assumptions are perfect :P
[07:02:40] <compact> your a legend, thanks heaps
[07:03:22] <BillCriswell> compact: http://jsbin.com/xaxowo/1/edit?js,output here is what I was thinking, sorry had a quick meeting.
[07:12:04] <compact> thanks heaps BillCriswell, playing around with it too
[07:12:07] <compact> thanks for your help guys
[07:12:07] <compact> night
[07:12:11] <BillCriswell> Later.
[07:14:54] <tnu0> Let's say I want to call an ajay get like http://localhost/something?artist=foo&track=bar  … Shouldn't this work? https://gist.github.com/Einenlum/d26a5b5b134916683fef
[07:15:10] <tnu0> ajax*
[07:15:23] <tnu0> It gives me http://localhost/something?artist=foo
[07:15:56] <BillCriswell> compact: http://jsbin.com/xaxowo/2/edit?js,output new and improved.
[07:17:01] <tnu0> Ok, my fault
[07:17:07] <tnu0> nextTrack['track'] was empty :)
[07:17:34] <negev> hi, this has been driving me crazy for over 2 hours now. i'm loading a colorbox modal which contains a form, and some kendo.ui widgets from telerik.com. all works fine. but when i post the form for validation, the response is the same form (as html) containing the same inputs etc, but when inserted into the dom the javascript to instantiate the widgets doesn't fire
[07:17:46] <negev> weirdly it works fine in another part of the application that appears to be doing exactly the same thing
[07:18:14] <negev> i've verified that the ajax response contains the javascript, but when i inspect the dom after the html is inserted the js is gone
[07:22:28] <sacho_> .html() doesn't execute script tags
[07:48:42] <Omar-> arschmitz page changes without transition when page is scrolled past 1000px?
[07:49:19] <arschmitz> thats correct
[07:49:21] <aboudreault> If I have multiple elements in my selector (2). What's the difference between $.each( $('.datepicker input'), function(key, el) { $(el).datetimepicker(dp_options) }); AND $('.datepicker input').datetimepicker(dp_options)
[07:49:27] <aboudreault> shoudln't they be the same?
[07:50:51] <Omar-> arschmitz so you usually $(window).scrollTop() or $("body").scrollTop() ?
[07:51:16] <arschmitz> its actual defualtHomeScroll which is more complicated then that
[07:51:26] <Omar-> I couldn;t find it in https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/31cc90ddc8c051cb01db46e270478c12be9685bb/js/transitions/transition.js#L158
[07:52:15] <Omar-> arschmitz I know, it's difficult to track down transition sequence
[07:53:40] <arschmitz> its not part of that
[07:54:02] <Omar-> hmmm I thought it was. I couldn't find it in the code :D
[07:59:27] <BillCriswell> aboudreault: Sounds about right.
[08:00:13] <aboudreault> BillCriswell, I was getting bad behavior with 2 inputs when doing this. using the .each solution seems to work. no sense to me though
[08:01:12] <BillCriswell> aboudreault: Sounds weird.
[08:07:57] <zadruga> I'm using jquery to style a file upload button. My code is in my functions.php file on my Wordpress site. It is throwing this error: Parse error: syntax error, unexpected '$', expecting '&' or variable (T_VARIABLE) Can someone help me find the problem? http://pastebin.com/bKSv7BEP
[08:09:05] <bbclover> in the jquery ajax success: function (response) parameter, we can call resposne anything, right? and if it the response happens to be an array, we can just start iterating over it?
[08:09:14] <bbclover> a json array
[08:11:14] <Omar-> bbclover yes success: function (data) { var array = data; more functions }
[08:11:34] <bbclover> oh so you should store data somewhere, you shouldn't simply start using it?
[08:12:06] <Omar-> no, it's just an example
[08:12:46] <Omar-> success: function (data) { $.each( data, function (index, value) { console.log(value) }); }
[08:13:41] <bbclover> k
[08:14:08] <Azrael_-> hi
[08:14:10] <Azrael_-> i'm attaching some events on a div (ondragover/ondragenter/ondragleave/ondrop) but they don't seem to fire, any ideas/hints why?
[08:16:28] <bbclover> how do you pronounce JSON? Jay-sun? like Jason in America?
[08:17:44] <Omar-> bbclover yup jay-sun
[08:17:56] <Omar-> Azrael_- can you create a fiddle, or paste your cde
[08:17:56] <bbclover> good
[08:18:03] <bbclover> According to Douglas Crockford who introduced JSON, it's pronounced like the name Jason (JAY-sun). I imagine anyone who pronounces it JAY-sawn also pronounces Bon Iver as Bon-Evair, or Browserify as Brow-sara-fy. - some guy lol
[08:31:34] <Velveeta> but... bon iver *is* pronounced bon-evair...
[08:32:54] <robertmaxrees> "bon" in the french sense - think "bone evair"
[08:33:04] <Omar-> Bon Iver (bohn-ee-vair)
[08:33:26] <Velveeta> ahhh gotcha, i thought it was the "evair" part he was pointing to with that pronunciation :D
[08:33:30] <robertmaxrees> most americans get that wrong because we're speshul
[08:33:42] <Velveeta> i know i'm special, my mommy even said so!
[08:33:58] <robertmaxrees> how's everybody this morning?
[08:34:32] <Velveeta> i'm doing great... we get a 4-day weekend for president's day, and i still had pto to burn before it reset, so i made it a 6-day weekend :D
[08:34:32] <Omar-> good and yours robertmaxrees
[08:34:48] <robertmaxrees> Velveeta niiiiiice
[08:34:55] <robertmaxrees> Omar- not too bad.  sleepy.
[08:35:07] <Velveeta> although i've found out that i'm absolutely terrible at sleeping in anymore... both yesterday and today, i thought i was sleeping in all badass, and when i finally decided to look at my watch, it was like 9am
[08:35:39] <robertmaxrees> hahahahahaha
[08:36:40] <Velveeta> trying to decide whether i should just drink the day away or what
[08:37:22] <robertmaxrees> if you can get away with it, the answer is "of course"
[08:37:45] <Velveeta> although i'm supposed to take a crack at some home improvement shi'ite today too... our toilet, after being wobbly for years, finally broke one of the bolts in the flange, and the wife wanted a new toilet anyway, so we got one yesterday, and get to try to swap them out today
[08:38:01] <robertmaxrees> shoulda gone with my company for it ;)
[08:38:04] <Velveeta> from what i understand (thanks youtube) it doesn't *appear* to be too difficult
[08:38:12] <Velveeta> oh yeah :D
[08:39:54] <robertmaxrees> we have a few videos on doing toilet installs.
[08:40:37] <robertmaxrees> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJb1e0mORhw boom
[09:08:58] <_97Whiskey> Is it possible to do like $('li:gt(2)').remove().('li:last-child').addclass(...) ?
[09:09:10] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[09:09:17] <Omar-> you removed them
[09:09:35] <robertmaxrees> that code doesn't make sense - that's two separate operations.
[09:09:38] <Velveeta> plus, you're not chaining an actual function there
[09:09:42] <Velveeta> yeah, that
[09:09:57] <_97Whiskey> Yeah, was trying to add a class to the last one after removing if some did get removed.
[09:10:02] <Velveeta> now, you could probably do .detach().find('li:last-child').addClass()
[09:10:03] <_97Whiskey> And do it as a one liner :)
[09:10:06] <robertmaxrees> $('li:last-child').addclass(...) - jus tmake this a new line.
[09:10:07] <Omar-> .('li:last-child').addclass(...) will throw an error
[09:10:12] <robertmaxrees> one liners are overrated.
[09:11:07] <_97Whiskey> Well I didn't want to throw it into an if, I'm not 100% what it will do if it doesn't remove anything and then trys to add the class that's already there.
[09:11:23] <robertmaxrees> nothing.
[09:11:27] <robertmaxrees> becuase addClass() checks for you.
[09:11:47] <Omar-> +1 addClass doesn't add the same class twice
[09:11:48] <_97Whiskey> Ahh nice nice, thank you.
[09:13:02] <Velveeta> so i saw some interesting jsperfs the other day that made me rethink some of my jquery code writing
[09:13:12] <Velveeta> i think they were in last week's jsweekly
[09:13:43] <Velveeta> https://medium.com/the-javascript-collection/lets-write-fast-javascript-2b03c5575d9e
[09:15:01] <robertmaxrees> hah.
[09:15:04] <Velveeta> here's their perf test for .val() (although in all fairness, they should have also cached the jquery-constructed object to isolate .val() and not add in the time from the constructor): http://jsperf.com/jquery-vanilla-val
[09:15:08] <kokut> Hello, I need to add a color to a list group element when a user clicks on a radio, any tips?
[09:15:30] <Velveeta> kokut: we can give you some tips if you show us a jsfiddle example first
[09:15:33] <kokut> i need it to clear the previous color and add the color to the element
[09:15:44] <kokut> because it's multiple choice
[09:16:06] <robertmaxrees> Velveeta i'd love to see real-world examples of this since most engines do JIT with might make some of this irrelevant in the real world.
[09:16:39] <Velveeta> well the jsperf test should give you some real world examples in your browser flavor of choice
[09:16:47] <robertmaxrees> not in context though.
[09:16:51] <robertmaxrees> which is what i care about.
[09:16:51] <Velveeta> that's true
[09:17:15] <robertmaxrees> but yeah, a lot of these are pretty sensiblle.
[09:17:44] <Velveeta> the thing that caught my eye was just how drastic of a difference there was in timings.. in chrome just now, i show 8491 operations for the jquery .val() call vs 1559020 operations for just using .value
[09:18:00] <Velveeta> so between a 1500-2000x difference
[09:18:00] <robertmaxrees> i wonder what all .val() does for each browser versus .value
[09:18:16] <Velveeta> and like i said, that also includes the jquery constructor time
[09:20:32] <Freetekton> http://i.imgur.com/XtqC4eI.gifv
[09:20:43] <robertmaxrees> not ok.
[09:20:47] <robertmaxrees> msg chanserv op #jquery
[09:20:51] <robertmaxrees> woops haha
[09:20:59] <Velveeta> yeah wtf
[09:22:08] <Velveeta> here's a version of that same jsperf with a precached jquery object and a precached raw dom reference: http://jsperf.com/jquery-vanilla-val/9 ... on my chrome, i show 11,878 for jquery, vs 5,207,342 for non, just for the .val() vs .value references
[09:22:43] <Velveeta> so a 438x difference.. man my math was way off up above :D
[09:23:17] <Velveeta> that should have been 183x up above, not 1500-2000, i was off by a whole order of magnitude
[09:25:15] <bbclover> can I not an ajax call in the success of another ajax call?
[09:25:20] <bbclover> do an ajax call*
[09:25:24] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[09:25:33] <robertmaxrees> $.ajax().done($.ajax());
[09:25:40] <bbclover> I can or can't?
[09:25:43] <Velveeta> you can
[09:25:44] <robertmaxrees> you can.
[09:26:56] <Velveeta> we have a component that's essentially a wrapper for $.ajax with built in handlebars support for processing templates from ajax response data, and bundle in a queue component we wrote to be able to process requests async or sync, depending on the way you set that queue option
[09:27:52] <Velveeta> most of the time everything's done async, but we had some server perf issues in the past where we'd peg the resources by sending 30+ requests for varying data metrics that it had to compute on the fly, so on those pages, we set it to process the requests synchronously
[09:28:18] <Velveeta> finally, the back end people got their act together and sped up and cached some of those computations so we could go back to async rendering
[09:28:48] <robertmaxrees> bbclover does that make sense?
[09:29:23] <Omar-> Velveeta nice link for JS tips. I cant understand #6
[09:29:25] <Velveeta> well actually the way that's written will kick both off at the same time, you'd want to wrap that 2nd one in a function wrapper to delay its invokation
[09:29:49] <bbclover> robertmaxrees: I think so. I'm getting an Invalid argument. error
[09:29:55] <Velveeta> omar-: notsureifmakingjokebecauseinjquerychannel.jpg
[09:29:55] <Omar-> in fact, I dont know how to code (function (data) {}(stuff, here);
[09:30:19] <robertmaxrees> bbclover you have you do .done(function($.ajax()));
[09:30:25] <Velveeta> there we go
[09:30:39] <robertmaxrees> .done() takes a function as an argument,'
[09:31:07] <Omar-> sorry #5
[09:31:14] <Velveeta> i'm kind of glad #6 is in that article too.. for too long, jquery has been the sledgehammer of front end dev
[09:31:21] <Velveeta> ahhhh gotcha
[09:31:41] <Velveeta> i'll throw together a gist to demonstrate
[09:31:43] <bbclover> I'm actually not using those wrapper functions are they called? I'm just doing $.ajax({ url: , \\etc });
[09:31:57] <bbclover> so that one is in the success: function() of another
[09:32:04] <robertmaxrees> bbclover you have to use an anonymous function there.
[09:32:09] <Lencl> my button doesn't work until I zoom in. is it because i'm supposed to use jquery .on touchstar? instead of regular onclick?
[09:32:22] <bbclover> how so?
[09:32:42] <Omar-> thanks Velveeta :)
[09:32:42] <robertmaxrees> bbclover http://fixee.org/paste/bqrknmq/
[09:32:55] <robertmaxrees> Lencl no way to know without seeing youir code
[09:33:49] <Lencl> sorry question was... my button doesn't work until I zoom in. is it because i'm supposed to use jquery .on touchstar? instead of regular onclick?
[09:33:53] <bbclover> but if my ajax call was in the success: function(response) { } of another? success: function(response) { function() { $.ajax() } }?
[09:34:02] <robertmaxrees> Lencl we can't know without seeing your code.
[09:34:20] <Velveeta> omar-: here you go: https://gist.github.com/Velveeta/f791f8a18ebff264a3ef
[09:34:24] <robertmaxrees> bbclover use .done() instead.  if you can't do that refactor, you have to next those functions.
[09:35:12] <bbclover> the issue here is the first ajax call is using yui haha...
[09:35:29] <robertmaxrees> http://fixee.org/paste/bqrknmq/#url=kmykeax
[09:35:34] <robertmaxrees> you just keep nesting them.
[09:35:51] <Velveeta> oh, well then whatever facility yui uses to let you know it's completed a request, drop your jquery $.ajax call into *that* success handler
[09:36:01] <robertmaxrees> ^ this
[09:36:10] <bbclover> right, that's what I did, but I got invalid arguments. in my network tab of IE I don't even see that the request to the url was being made
[09:36:17] <Omar-> Velveeta thank you! what about IIFE (function() {})(what, goes, here);
[09:36:22] <robertmaxrees> right, becuase the requesy was never make.
[09:36:31] <robertmaxrees> bbclover share your code.
[09:36:33] <Velveeta> omar-: no problem, and one sec and i'll show you an example there too
[09:36:37] <Omar-> what, goes, here: is also data passed within the functuin?
[09:36:50] <Omar-> function*
[09:37:03] <robertmaxrees> http://benalman.com/news/2010/11/immediately-invoked-function-expression/ Omar-
[09:37:11] <Lencl> robbyoconnor: http://pastebin.com/NpG7EWCA
[09:37:17] <robertmaxrees> bad autocomplete.
[09:37:26] <robertmaxrees> Lencl that's not the right way to do event bindings.
[09:37:31] <robertmaxrees> use .on() for everything instea.d
[09:37:46] <Lencl> why? what are the disadvantages?
[09:37:57] <robertmaxrees> inline handlers couple your markup to your javascript.
[09:38:12] <robertmaxrees> what happens when you refactor your js?  you now have 15 different places to update code instead of one
[09:38:13] <bbclover> http://pastebin.com/iU3axBqA
[09:38:24] <robertmaxrees> just like why your CSS should be in a stylesheet.
[09:38:36] <Lencl> ah I see
[09:39:00] <Velveeta> omar-: ok, just refresh that same gist, i updated it
[09:39:01] <bbclover> so I don't even my code ever going into the success, it just errors every time and tells me Invalid argument
[09:39:14] <Lencl> robbyoconnor: when i'm using mobile.. it won't work unless I zoom in
[09:39:21] <robertmaxrees> Lencl bad autocomplete again.
[09:39:26] <robertmaxrees> you're pinging the wrong person :)
[09:39:30] <Velveeta> and bbclover, just to expand on something robert showed you with nesting those ajax calls, i'm gonna update a little of his code
[09:39:51] <robertmaxrees> Lencl http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/Lxe862nq/1/
[09:39:52] <robertmaxrees> do this instead.
[09:39:59] <bbclover> ok
[09:40:01] <robertmaxrees> see if doing it this way fixes your problems.
[09:40:03] <Omar-> robertmaxrees yea, I need to re-read that article
[09:40:24] <Omar-> Velveeta thanks a lot, I really appreciate your effort. You made it clear :)
[09:40:29] <Omar-> muchas gracias
[09:40:40] <Velveeta> omar-: no problemo :)
[09:40:42] <robertmaxrees> bbclover yeah, you just keep nesting $.ajax() into those success: references.
[09:40:50] <robertmaxrees> Velveeta is gettin' you an example apparently.
[09:41:04] <Velveeta> i'm just gonna demo it in a promise chain
[09:41:13] <Omar-> Velveeta lol, you remind me of "nanny plum"
[09:41:21] <Omar-> "no problemo"
[09:41:24] <Velveeta> i'm not sure who that is :D
[09:41:25] <robertmaxrees> Velveeta that's smart.  promises++
[09:41:33] <Omar-> ?g nanny plum
[09:41:34] <b-ot> Omar-: Ben and Holly Nanny Plum and the wise old elf swap jobs - YouTube → http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnpUMABTeeY
[09:41:57] <Lencl> robertmaxrees: preventDefault prevents the page from doing anything else correct?
[09:42:14] <Lencl> robertmaxrees: is this click event something you recommend for all jquery clicks?
[09:42:37] <robertmaxrees> Lencl e.preventDefault(); prevents the default action, so for links it doesn't go to the new page.
[09:42:46] <robertmaxrees> and yes, i suggest using .on() for event bindings.
[09:43:24] <Omar-> http://benalman.com/news/2010/11/immediately-invoked-function-expression/ this article's level is beyond mine
[09:43:25] <Omar-> :/
[09:43:28] <Velveeta> here's an alternate method bbclover: http://fixee.org/paste/bqrknmq/#url=ryf36fv
[09:43:38] <robertmaxrees> Omar- we can help you make sense of it :)
[09:43:42] <Velveeta> that way you avoid that sideways christmas tree if you nest too deeply
[09:43:49] <robertmaxrees> yessss.
[09:44:18] <Velveeta> oops, type in req3 (re3), but whatever, you get the idea :D
[09:44:37] <Omar-> robertmaxrees thanks! I'll try to concentrate :D
[09:45:25] <robertmaxrees> Omar- the long and short is that (function() {}()) is a magical device that gives you a one-time-use, throwaway scope.
[09:45:35] <Lencl> robertmaxrees, what is the e parameter that is passed called? is it the event handler?
[09:45:49] <robertmaxrees> that's the event object.
[09:46:14] <Lencl> how would I pass my own parameters to that?
[09:46:16] <Omar-> robertmaxrees great! what does "scope" mean in JS? lol
[09:46:21] <robertmaxrees> Lencl don't.
[09:46:33] <robertmaxrees> you can, but that usually winds up being code smell.
[09:46:37] <robertmaxrees> brb
[09:46:39] <Omar-> (function(){})( scope ); right?
[09:46:59] <Lencl> ah so you can recommend getting everything using .val() from inputs I'm guessing?
[09:47:01] <Lencl> ok np
[09:47:11] <Velveeta> omar-: scope is what the 'this' keyword refers to within a function
[09:47:14] * Omar- reading more about IIFE
[09:47:29] <Velveeta> in the case of invoking a function like obj.method(), 'this' refers to obj
[09:47:34] <shoky> function() { ...scope... }
[09:47:43] <Velveeta> in the case of just invoking something like foo(), 'this' refers to the window
[09:47:49] <robertmaxrees> Lencl you have a reference to the "current element" with the this object - $(this) would be the jquery-fied version.
[09:47:51] <shoky> think you're confusing scope with context, Velveeta
[09:48:01] <Velveeta> oh you're right, my bad
[09:48:02] <bbclover> Velveeta: but if the request isn't showing up in my network tab does that mean my url is wrong? or is my response bad?
[09:48:14] <robertmaxrees> bbclover do you have any console errors?
[09:48:28] <robertmaxrees> Lencl you could to 'this.value' or '$(this).val()' for input values.
[09:48:30] <Velveeta> i'm so used to referring to 'changing the scope of a function' via call or apply, i got those 2 terms munged in my head :D
[09:48:47] <robertmaxrees> i assume you wnat the text in an <a> tag though, yeah?  that'd be $(this).text()
[09:48:50] <bbclover> Invalid argument., that's it. I have a breakpoint on the ajax call, when I step into it, it goes straight to Error: function()
[09:48:51] <shoky> ;]
[09:49:07] <robertmaxrees> bbclover that's the issue - the ajax won't work if your js is busted.
[09:49:08] <Velveeta> so yeah, shoky's version is more correct, 'scope' refers to everything within a function wrapper, since javascript doesn't have true block-level scoping like C or PHP or Java
[09:49:15] * Omar- scratches his head
[09:49:18] <robertmaxrees> lol
[09:49:33] <robertmaxrees> confusing the poor dude.  let me show you an example.
[09:49:35] <bbclover> but idk where it's busted
[09:49:39] <Omar-> lol
[09:49:41] <Lencl> robbyoconnor: but how about when it's multiple params? what's the best way?
[09:49:44] <robertmaxrees> bbclover it should show you a line.
[09:49:47] <Velveeta> so in some languages, you can do this: if (true) { var foo = 1; } and outside of that if statement, foo doesn't exist, it's scoped to that if block
[09:49:51] <robertmaxrees> Lencl you keep using the wrong username for me.
[09:49:57] <bbclover> it's not
[09:50:02] <robertmaxrees> Lencl don't pass params to event handlers if you can avoid it.
[09:50:07] <robertmaxrees> and 9/10 you can.
[09:50:14] <Velveeta> in javascript, the scope is function-level, so if you do if (true) { var foo = 1 } foo is actually available to the entire function
[09:50:15] <Lencl> lol sorry robertmaxrees
[09:50:29] <Lencl> what's wrong with too many params?
[09:50:38] <Lencl> I do that a lot
[09:50:41] <Velveeta> if you want to truly isolate some variables from the rest of the body of a function, you can use an IIFE to create a one-time throw away scope to contain them in
[09:50:45] <robertmaxrees> the event handler should be self contained.
[09:50:51] <Velveeta> i'll make another gist to demonstrate
[09:51:02] <robertmaxrees> brb
[09:51:04] <Omar-> Velveeta in case foo is within a (function() {})(); right?
[09:51:12] <Omar-> tyt robertmaxrees
[09:51:25] <Omar-> Velveeta sorry :/ and thanks again :)
[09:51:44] <Lencl> robertmaxrees: for example, if I have a form that has 10 fields to edit... and user changes all those fields (using ajax to update database), don't I have to pass all those as params?
[09:53:08] <Omar-> Lencl you can collect all values in an array and pass them to server
[09:54:32] <robertmaxrees> Lencl you collect them in the event handler.
[09:54:32] <Lencl> Omar-: using ajax right?
[09:54:48] <robertmaxrees> actually, the "right" way is to cache references to all of those and then run .val() against them to get what you want.
[09:55:10] <Forbidd3n> Anyone that can help with storing dropzone files and submitting with my form? I followed this tutorial (https://github.com/enyo/dropzone/wiki/Combine-normal-form-with-Dropzone) and I am getting an error on this line. (this.element.querySelector("button[type=submit]").addEventListener("click",) -- error: TypeError: this.element.querySelector(...) is null
[09:55:34] <robertmaxrees> Forbidd3n need to see your code in a fiddle.
[09:56:49] <Omar-> Lencl yes ajax
[09:58:05] <Velveeta> ok omar-: here's an example of 3 different styles: https://gist.github.com/Velveeta/5614111ecdeabcf10d40
[09:58:52] <Lencl> robertmaxrees: what exactly is caching references? is it referring to cache selectors? like this one: https://eamann.com/tech/selector-caching-jquery/
[09:59:11] <robertmaxrees> var $someInput = $('#someInput');
[09:59:52] <Lencl> ah I see
[09:59:55] <Forbidd3n> robertmaxrees: here is my form and dropzone code - http://jsfiddle.net/qczm4g8c/
[10:00:35] <Lencl> apprectiate the help thank you
[10:00:41] <robertmaxrees> can you include the dropzome plugin pls? use the external resources on the left.
[10:01:48] <Forbidd3n> I can't seem to find a cdn to include it
[10:01:54] <robertmaxrees> linky
[10:02:00] <robertmaxrees> is there a git repo?
[10:02:19] <Forbidd3n> https://github.com/enyo/dropzone
[10:02:34] <Omar-> Velveeta case #2 is interesting.
[10:02:39] <robertmaxrees> you can use https://rawgit.com/ Forbidd3n
[10:02:53] <Velveeta> omar-: yeah, hoisting throws a lot of people off when they first find out about that concept
[10:03:00] <robertmaxrees> ew
[10:03:21] <Velveeta> basically, the compiler makes 2 passes through the code, 1 to find all declarations and hoist them to the top of the function block, and the 2nd actually processes everything
[10:03:54] <robertmaxrees> Forbidd3n http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/qczm4g8c/1/ like this. and i'm getting an error for no url provided.
[10:03:59] <Velveeta> so in the case of #2, there's an implied "var bar;" at the top of that function, which defines it, but leaves it with no value, so it overrides the outer declaration
[10:04:33] <Velveeta> so it then initializes it with the value 5 inside of that if statement, but if that statement doesn't come through as true, it still has the value 'undefined', which is what gets output at the bottom
[10:05:14] <Forbidd3n> robertmaxrees: I forgot the top line - http://jsfiddle.net/qczm4g8c/2/
[10:05:31] <robertmaxrees> still getting that error.
[10:06:51] <Omar-> Velveeta case #3 is fantastic http://jsfiddle.net/Palestinian/ww639tzd/
[10:07:29] <Omar-> now, in case #2 if i declare bar: var bar = 1; instead of bar = 1; is it the same?
[10:07:52] <Velveeta> yep, that's the only real way to do encapsulation in javascript is to use functions to hide whatever's intended to stay private
[10:07:52] <Omar-> when declaring a variable with or without "var" does it make any difference?
[10:08:01] <robertmaxrees> yes.
[10:08:04] <robertmaxrees> a huge one.
[10:08:04] <Velveeta> yep
[10:08:14] <robertmaxrees> omitting var pushes it to the global scope.
[10:08:23] <Velveeta> if you don't use var, any variable, no matter how deeply nested, is automatically global
[10:08:37] <robertmaxrees> it's *technically* an error, but the js engine thinks you forgot it and just makes it global.
[10:08:52] <Omar-> so "var" == global variable
[10:08:56] <robertmaxrees> no.
[10:08:58] <Velveeta> and if i'm reading your other question correctly, you're asking if you declared and initialized it in the same statement, how would hoisting work?
[10:08:58] <Omar-> yeah?
[10:08:58] <robertmaxrees> opposite.
[10:09:01] <robertmaxrees> no var is global.
[10:09:04] <Velveeta> no, var !== global
[10:09:04] <robertmaxrees> and wrong.
[10:09:13] * Omar- facepalms
[10:09:16] <robertmaxrees> because it's technically an error.
[10:09:18] <Velveeta> always var
[10:09:45] <Omar-> Velveeta re my question, yes the inital var
[10:09:55] <Velveeta> in fact, in the few rare cases where i *do* want something to be a global reference, usually only when i'm writing tests for something, i explicitly assign it to the window object to denote that it's intentional
[10:10:01] <robertmaxrees> ^
[10:10:05] <Velveeta> so instead of just: foo = 5; i say window.foo = 5
[10:10:05] <robertmaxrees> window.someThing
[10:10:17] <robertmaxrees> that clues in other folks and makes your linter happy.
[10:10:25] <robertmaxrees> linting is the shiz.
[10:10:26] <Forbidd3n> robertmaxrees: try this url - http://jsfiddle.net/qczm4g8c/4/
[10:10:36] <robertmaxrees> baller.
[10:10:37] <Forbidd3n> you have to put the line prior to on load
[10:10:39] <Velveeta> so, if you define and initialize a variable in the same step, hoisting still breaks it up into 2 steps, the declaration, and the initialization
[10:10:56] <Velveeta> the compiler only hoists the declaration
[10:11:00] <Omar-> sorry.. window.foo = 1 equals to foo = 1? or var foo = 1?
[10:11:06] <Omar-> or neither
[10:11:06] <robertmaxrees> the first of those two.
[10:11:07] <Omar-> lol
[10:11:14] <robertmaxrees> foo = 1;
[10:11:26] <robertmaxrees> if you never use var for foo, it's global.
[10:11:41] <Velveeta> so if you say: var foo = 5; on line 5 of your function, hoisting only lifts the: var foo; bit to the top, and still waits to initialize it to 5 on that line where you originally wrote it
[10:11:50] <Omar-> I've always thought var is global
[10:11:54] <robertmaxrees> Omar- nope.
[10:11:58] <robertmaxrees> var is scoped.
[10:11:59] <robertmaxrees> and correct.
[10:12:06] <robertmaxrees> Forbidd3n so how do I replicate from here?
[10:12:07] <Omar-> let me play around and some tests before I bug you haha
[10:12:15] <Velveeta> sounds good
[10:12:22] <Forbidd3n> not sure it isn't giving the same error - one sec
[10:12:24] <Omar-> last question? :D
[10:12:35] <Velveeta> omar-: ask as many as you like, that's why we're here :)
[10:12:36] <Omar-> nevermind
[10:12:57] <Omar-> I need to read JS 101 for dummies first
[10:12:58] <Omar-> lol
[10:13:12] <Velveeta> in general, it's best practice to always declare your variables at the top of a function block for clarity, because that's how the compiler is going to interpret the code anyway
[10:13:35] <robertmaxrees> AND it clues other devs into knowing what's in that scope.
[10:13:38] <Velveeta> you may hold off on initializing them until they hit some condition to trigger getting their value set, but you should at least declare them at the top of the block
[10:13:42] <Velveeta> right
[10:14:00] <robertmaxrees> even better with cases like ifs and fors since they don't create new scopes.
[10:14:19] <Velveeta> so don't feel like you're wasting memory by declaring them up front and not using them until later, if ever, because some might not ever be used depending on program flow... because if the compiler will declare them for you even if you don't
[10:15:06] <robertmaxrees> you also end up setting up the contract that the var will exist.  if it's going to be an array later, doing something like var myArray = []; myArray.forEach(someFunc); is nice because you're not playing guessing games.
[10:15:13] <robertmaxrees> you're fulfilling the contract of the object.
[10:15:51] <robertmaxrees> it's why i lol when people are like "hay how do i check the type of an object?" it's like... don't.  just make sure it's always that.
[10:16:06] <Omar-> Velveeta robertmaxrees http://jsfiddle.net/Palestinian/8tc0vfje/ in this messy code, what does "Omar" do? what is it meant to do?
[10:16:44] <Velveeta> it's meant to supply the value of bar to that IIFE
[10:17:23] <Omar-> Velveeta so instead of Omar it should be "bar"?
[10:17:25] <Velveeta> another typical best practice is that you should reuse variable names in lower scopes, because it makes it less easy to interpret which level of scope that variable is referencing
[10:17:29] <Velveeta> right
[10:17:36] <Velveeta> you would pass bar where you're passing Omar
[10:17:50] <Velveeta> and probably receive it in that IIFE *as* Omar so you're not reusing the same name of bar
[10:17:59] <Velveeta> and then just make references to Omar inside that function
[10:18:41] <Velveeta> technically, this is all legal: window.bar = 1; function foo () { var bar = 2; (function (bar) { bar = 3; }(bar)); }
[10:19:12] <Velveeta> and all of those would have their own different identities in the code, but another developer reading that would have a pain in the ass time trying to figure out which bar was which
[10:19:21] <Omar-> Velveeta so I can pass the same var in IIFE function(bar) and (bar); at the end
[10:19:31] <Omar-> http://jsfiddle.net/Palestinian/8tc0vfje/1/ both values undefined
[10:19:39] <Velveeta> you can, yes, but it leads to your code being more difficult to understand
[10:20:15] <Velveeta> so the reason they're both undefined there is that the foo you're receiving in function hello isn't being passed in as a parameter, you're calling hello() with no arguments
[10:20:24] <Velveeta> so the local variable foo is now undefined
[10:20:33] <Omar-> ohh true
[10:21:27] <Omar-> makes sense now
[10:22:01] <robertmaxrees> scope in js is one of those things where it seems really strange on the surface, but once you get over that initial hump, it's easy to grok.
[10:22:10] <Velveeta> yepyep
[10:22:18] * Velveeta puts on his "I grok Spock" tshirt.
[10:24:11] <Omar-> http://jsfiddle.net/Palestinian/8tc0vfje/2/ "outside foo" returns foo's value within IIFE
[10:24:55] <Omar-> so foo from within IIFE has become a global variable, right?
[10:24:58] <robertmaxrees> no.
[10:25:08] <robertmaxrees> you're editing the parent "foo" within the IIFE>
[10:25:41] <robertmaxrees> it's the same variable throughout - it's bound to the highest scope (function) it was declared in.
[10:26:26] <jayjo> If I get 'unexpected token u' on an ajax call and the line is in <!DOCTYPE html> does that mean I'm getting html back when I shouldn't be?
[10:26:48] <robertmaxrees> jayjo yep.  do you have datatype:json set?
[10:26:50] <robertmaxrees> Omar- http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/89k1qx0c/
[10:26:54] <Omar-> robertmaxrees if I declare it inside hello() and before IIFE function, it would return origibal value?
[10:27:14] <jayjo> robertmaxrees: yea I do. I have dataType:"json"
[10:27:18] <jayjo> will the quotes interfere?
[10:27:25] <robertmaxrees> jayjo that's not what you want.
[10:27:32] <robertmaxrees> dataType is what you're expecting back from the server.
[10:27:34] <robertmaxrees> delete that line.
[10:27:55] <jayjo> robertmaxrees: but I should be getting json back
[10:28:04] <jayjo> instead it's saying html is being returned?
[10:28:04] <robertmaxrees> jayjo then your server is returning the wrong thing.
[10:28:07] <robertmaxrees> yes.
[10:28:14] <jayjo> OK thanks, let me take a minute more to look into it
[10:28:19] <Omar-> robertmaxrees oh, I understand now
[10:28:43] <Omar-> thanks robertmaxrees and Velveeta. I appreciate your time :)
[10:28:52] <Omar-> I gtg now, have a nice weekend!
[10:28:56] <robertmaxrees> enjoy mano!
[10:28:58] <Omar-> talk to you later
[10:29:11] <Omar-> robertmaxrees thanks you too :)
[10:29:16] <Omar-> adios!!
[11:00:33] <jayjo> Is it bad design to use multiple separate ajax calls to keep your code modular, because it means multiple requests to your server?
[11:01:11] <jayjo> Eg, should one ajax ever trigger another ajax call, or should that all be handled in the first call
[11:01:24] <snover> yes, but more importantly your design is bad and you are abstracting at the wrong level if that is the case
[11:03:19] <jayjo> So it's better to have a bit longer on a response than to chain them. That makes sense, but I wanted to make sure.
[11:04:40] <sacho_> jayjo, it's quite common to have multiple ajax calls
[11:05:05] <sacho_> especially on dashboard or other such portal pages
[11:05:51] <robertmaxrees> as long as you’re being smart about your UI/UX with them, you’re fine.
[11:13:56] <gr3yh47> hello. I'm trying to set the value of a text field and i'm running into some variable scoping issues. how can i get data from the getJSON callback up one scope level? https://dpaste.de/CSz7
[11:14:18] <robertmaxrees> you don’t.
[11:14:23] <robertmaxrees> because those are async calls.
[11:15:00] <gr3yh47> well i have data from 2 different json objects that i need to combine
[11:15:05] <gr3yh47> so how do i do that
[11:15:09] <robertmaxrees> use promises :) i’ll show you.
[11:15:16] <gr3yh47> from 2 different json urls
[11:15:17] <gr3yh47> ok
[11:15:30] <robertmaxrees> you’ve got the scope right, fwiw, but the ajax calls aren’t finishing before you’re trying to set that value.
[11:17:45] <robertmaxrees> http://fixee.org/paste/8rjuci3/ like this.
[11:18:09] <gr3yh47> woah
[11:18:11] <gr3yh47> cool
[11:18:16] <robertmaxrees> deferreds.
[11:18:28] <gr3yh47> built into jquery too. i didn't know that.
[11:18:45] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[11:18:49] <gr3yh47> although i don't really know any jqueryat all heh
[11:19:03] <robertmaxrees> not currently compliant with the spec, but the next major version should be.
[11:19:06] <gr3yh47> just hacking enough into my django app for some dynamic forms
[11:19:28] <gr3yh47> looks like i'm using 1.11.1
[11:19:32] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[11:19:52] <robertmaxrees> when they bump everything to version 3 (the next major release), promises should be spec compliant last i checked.
[11:22:17] <Guest67048> hi
[11:22:43] <robertmaxrees> hello
[11:22:50] <gr3yh47> should still work here though right
[11:22:56] <robertmaxrees> gr3yh47 yep.
[11:23:01] <gr3yh47> thanks a ton
[11:23:05] <gr3yh47> fiddling a bit
[11:23:09] <robertmaxrees> fsho - did that fix your issue?
[11:25:57] <gr3yh47> i'm running into an issue where one of the data.fields is undefined
[11:26:05] <gr3yh47> maybe an issue with my JSON url
[11:26:18] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[11:26:20] <gr3yh47> working on it and will know for sure after that
[11:26:38] <gr3yh47> bJsonData.fields is undefined
[11:26:45] <gr3yh47> fixed some variable names
[11:26:57] <robertmaxrees> console.log(bJsonData); and see if that’s the right structure.
[11:26:59] <robertmaxrees> i may have munged that.
[11:27:04] <gr3yh47> nah
[11:27:07] <gr3yh47> the other one works
[11:27:16] <robertmaxrees> alright.
[11:27:18] <gr3yh47> i think it isn't getting the JSON data at all
[11:27:24] <robertmaxrees> weird.
[11:27:34] <gr3yh47> something wrong with my logic in the part of the app that handles giving that JSON
[11:27:36] <robertmaxrees> check the network tab to make sure.
[11:29:13] <gr3yh47> hrm
[11:29:16] <gr3yh47> it's correct
[11:29:19] <gr3yh47> getting the object
[11:29:40] <gr3yh47> i'm actually logging the thing to console
[11:29:57] <gr3yh47> and its coming up as an object with fields
[11:29:58] <robertmaxrees> hrm...
[11:30:14] <gr3yh47> http://fixee.org/paste/8rjuci3/#url=sj1vh10
[11:30:20] <gr3yh47> logging it in the same scope too
[11:31:13] <gr3yh47> it's lying to me
[11:31:18] <gr3yh47> it's telling me it's undefined
[11:31:26] <gr3yh47> and then immediately logging it to console
[11:31:27] <robertmaxrees> any other console errors?
[11:31:31] <gr3yh47> where i can see that it's defined
[11:31:32] <gr3yh47> nope
[11:31:57] <robertmaxrees> hrmm...
[11:32:11] <choosegoose> what is textStatus argument of the 'success' function for $.ajax?
[11:32:35] <Velveeta> 'success'
[11:32:50] <Velveeta> i'm pretty sure that's all that ever comes through in the success handler
[11:32:57] <choosegoose> ah
[11:32:58] <gr3yh47> robertmaxrees: oddly, the error comes before the logging
[11:33:19] <gr3yh47> robertmaxrees: even though the logging comes before the use of the dJsonData var
[11:33:30] <gr3yh47> erm
[11:33:38] <gr3yh47> error comes first in the console output
[11:33:42] <Velveeta> you can use that textStatus a little more usefully in something like the complete handler, where it fires for either success or error, and you can inspect it to see which one occurred
[11:33:44] <gr3yh47> logging comes first in the code
[11:34:19] <robertmaxrees> what line is it pointing to?
[11:34:37] <gr3yh47> TypeError: dJsonData.fields is undefined
[11:34:45] <gr3yh47> no line givin and clicking does nothing
[11:35:00] <Velveeta> gr3yh47: are you doing this in chrome?
[11:35:03] <robertmaxrees> oh getJson doesn’t return a promise wtf.
[11:35:06] <gr3yh47> but the only place where 'dJson.fields' is used is at the end of the where call
[11:35:10] <gr3yh47> *when call
[11:35:12] <Velveeta> it doesn't? wtf indeed
[11:35:16] <gr3yh47> hah
[11:35:26] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/jquery.getjson/
[11:35:36] <robertmaxrees> woah wait hrmm..
[11:35:39] <gr3yh47> i just want a synchronus json getter
[11:35:44] <robertmaxrees> no, you don’t.
[11:35:47] <robertmaxrees> that’;ll lock the browser.
[11:35:48] <gr3yh47> so i can return a value
[11:35:52] <gr3yh47> and go on about my day
[11:36:00] <robertmaxrees> that’ll cause the browser to freeze.
[11:36:23] <gr3yh47> only for a microsecond
[11:36:27] <robertmaxrees> doens’t matter.
[11:36:35] <gr3yh47> i know i know :P
[11:36:38] <robertmaxrees> and it returns a jqXHR, which itself is a promise, so that’s not an issue.
[11:36:41] <Velveeta> you know what slexaxton says about blocking scripts?
[11:36:54] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[11:36:56] <gr3yh47> i'll be back on monday i have to punch the clock for the day
[11:37:08] <Velveeta> he says screw that facebook group: https://alexsexton.com/blog/2015/02/the-15-commandments-of-front-end-performance/
[11:37:08] <gr3yh47> thanks for the help so far
[11:37:18] <robertmaxrees> oh yeah i remember that,
[11:37:31] <Velveeta> :D
[11:37:35] <robertmaxrees> dammit linda
[11:37:37] <gr3yh47> if you come up with something magically msg me or it will be gone by the time i'm back
[11:37:39] <gr3yh47> and thanks again
[11:37:47] <Velveeta> linda linda linda, listen
[11:38:48] <choosegoose> say I have a button in a modal such that it closes that modal on click. In .on('click', function(){...}), is it best to find the overall modal using 'this', or reference the modal directly by id, or class?
[11:39:05] <robertmaxrees> use the “this” reference.
[11:39:14] <robertmaxrees> because you already have it.
[11:39:29] <robertmaxrees> also: you could then support multiple modals on the page.
[11:39:54] <robertmaxrees> also also - you can avoid a DOM operation by not having to re-find where you want to be.  $(this).closest(‘.modal’); and call it a dat.
[11:42:55] <choosegoose> thanks
[11:44:46] <choosegoose> hm; I have a modal where the content is loaded via AJAX, and I want to run javascript (for example, to setup the "close" button) on that resulting DOM; how would I best reference that javascript? The javascript would be useful in other modals (and, say, regular pages)
[11:45:23] <robertmaxrees> use a delegated listener then.
[11:45:57] <robertmaxrees> instead of running your js over and over.
[11:46:43] <choosegoose> I guess .on('click', ...) should apply to newly loaded modal content then... it doesn't seem to be but I'll test more
[11:47:09] <robertmaxrees> nope...
[11:47:20] <robertmaxrees> $(parent).on(‘click’, ‘child’, function() {});
[11:47:32] <choosegoose> oh
[11:47:35] <robertmaxrees> read http://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events
[11:47:37] <robertmaxrees> and with that, lunch
[11:47:38] <robertmaxrees> brb
[11:48:01] <choosegoose> thanks
[11:51:04] <Velveeta> choosegoose: your name is making my brain smoke, because it keeps wanting to read it as choocegooce or choozgooz
[11:51:51] <choosegoose> Velveeta, http://advetime.ru/uploads/2013/07/tumblr_mdeq2kta371qcrkq2o1_5001.jpg
[11:52:10] <Velveeta> why, that goose is made of spaghetti!
[11:52:31] <choosegoose> to non-lunchers: would using document as the selector for delegated events be ok or inefficient? in my situation it's a simple on('click')
[11:55:15] <Velveeta> it would be ok, but if you have a lower container element in the document that's always going to contain these items, it would be better placed there
[11:58:08] <choosegoose> thanks
[12:00:51] <choosegoose> in the context of managing the DOM, is it better to wrap form tags as widely as possible, as tightly as possible, or is it a matter of needs/style?
[12:03:30] <bbclover> yeah, I just can't figure this out... why would my $.ajax() class go straight from there to error: function() ? It doesn't even look the request is being attempted
[12:22:20] <cryptoloot> hi, I have working code that pulls single market data from cryptsy api and Im hoping someone can help me modify with array and loop to pull and display from multiple markets code here: http://jsfiddle.net/cryptojohn/44odn82h/
[12:26:37] <t4nk236> How could I get the html source code for the following url: https://plusone.google.com/_/+1/fastbutton?url=http://www.google.com/ via jquery? a simple $.get(url, function(data) {} );  is not possible (cross domain origin)
[12:28:00] <t4nk236> I tried jsonp as well ( http://pastebin.com/UhDMMVkv  ) but I get the following error in my firefox webconsole: SyntaxError: expected expression, got '<'
[12:28:11] <asahi> can someone tell me where the documentation is on the $.ajax() response?
[12:30:00] <choosegoose> asahi, http://api.jquery.com/jquery.ajax/ ?
[12:30:35] <asahi> choosegoose: thank you
[12:42:41] <cryptoloot> if someone can provide working code for my above question I can offer .1 BTC as payment
[12:43:45] <robertmaxrees> not a good place for that, cryptoloot
[12:44:06] <robertmaxrees> we can help you do it though :)
[12:44:08] <cryptoloot> really need some help
[12:44:30] <robertmaxrees> what part are you stuck on
[12:44:30] <robertmaxrees> ?
[12:44:36] <cryptoloot> not my original code and my knowledge is elementary
[12:44:50] <robertmaxrees> if you need to hire someone, check out a freelance channel.
[12:45:35] <cryptoloot> i was hoping someone could review the code and tell me how to add an array & loop to output multiple markets
[12:46:33] <robertmaxrees> we’ll help you write that out, sure :)_
[12:46:42] <cryptoloot> awesome
[12:46:43] <robertmaxrees> which var is the one you need to swap out?
[12:48:18] <cryptoloot> line 45 "market".
[12:48:35] <robertmaxrees> okay - so do you have the array of markets you’d ike to use instead?
[12:49:24] <robertmaxrees> t4nk236 you can’t.
[12:49:32] <robertmaxrees> if cross-domain is an issue, you won’t be able to use javascript.
[12:49:37] <robertmaxrees> at least, not client-side.
[12:50:00] <cryptoloot> the problem is when I use the all market data url http://pubapi.cryptsy.com/api.php?method=marketdatav2 the json is nested
[12:50:18] <choosegoose> I have a data-foo attribute that must always be a URL; does it still make sense to use .data("foo")?
[12:50:30] <robertmaxrees> choosegoose yes
[12:50:39] <robertmaxrees> any time you’re interacting the data attributes, use .data()
[12:50:46] <choosegoose> thanks
[12:50:48] <t4nk236> robertmaxrees: thanks. i run into cross domain issues from time to time and still can't wrap my head around it, because if I paste the url in browser I get a response. I'll use php & curl then
[12:51:02] <robertmaxrees> t4nk236 right - because you’re not going across domains.
[12:52:02] <robertmaxrees> cryptoloot i’m not sure what nesting has to do with here.
[12:52:21] <robertmaxrees> it looks like you want to hit this first api, then call a series of other apis?
[12:53:02] <t4nk236> robertmaxrees: I don't get the difference between pasting the url in my browser address bar (OK) and making a request with the exact same url a few inches below in my webconsole (NOT OK) :) but I'll read up on it
[12:53:19] <robertmaxrees> t4nk236 your console isn’t going to be from the same url.
[12:53:27] <robertmaxrees> it needs to be the same port, protocol, and domain.
[12:54:03] <robertmaxrees> so you can do http://example.com -> http://example.com, but http://sub.example.com -> http://example.com won’t work without special setup on your server.
[12:54:11] <cryptoloot> there are 2 way to pull from the api. single markets one at a time or all data at once. When pulled single market at a time the json is easier to pull from, when multiple markets url is used the cant seem to output results
[12:54:35] <robertmaxrees> cryptoloot because that main API call is too much data for a browser to realistically handle at once.
[12:54:47] <robertmaxrees> you’re calling these through yahoo... do they not have public apis available?
[12:56:29] <cryptoloot> TBH i dont know why the yahoo was added. Cryptsy has public api https://www.cryptsy.com/pages/publicapi
[12:57:04] <robertmaxrees> probably to circumvent CORS.
[13:07:01] <bbclover> if I'm passing an arary with an ajax call, can I simple do data: { paramtername: arrayname }, ?
[13:07:13] <bbclover> simply*
[13:07:39] <robertmaxrees> maybe?
[13:07:48] <bbclover> cause on my server side it's saying it can't find a variable named parametername
[13:07:58] <robertmaxrees> quotes around it.
[13:08:01] <robertmaxrees> doubles.
[13:08:36] <bbclover> what
[13:08:49] <robertmaxrees> {”paramtername”: arrayname}
[13:09:00] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, paste up your code.
[13:09:23] <bbclover> oh I have to put it in quotes?
[13:09:25] <bbclover> is that just cause it's an array?
[13:09:36] <d[^_^]b> http://jsfiddle.net/L2qurc2g/ <= i've got this trying to show a list of notifications gathered via simple API script
[13:09:37] <robertmaxrees> huh? no.
[13:09:44] <bbclover> cause here it's not in quotes: http://learn.jquery.com/ajax/jquery-ajax-methods/
[13:09:57] <robertmaxrees> where are you getting the error?
[13:10:06] <d[^_^]b> it works alright (could be much better) but so far when i clic the 'close' button for the notification it will submit all of the delnotification commands at once
[13:10:08] <bbclover> it's a 500 internal server error
[13:10:27] <robertmaxrees> bbclover shouldn’t matter to the client site.  server side might be different.
[13:10:30] <bbclover> I set a breakpoint in my java code and that's where the problem is
[13:10:49] <robertmaxrees> d[^_^]b which line are you having issues with in particular?
[13:11:35] <robertmaxrees> bbclover dunno then - the js isn’t broken, sounds like the java isn’t deserializing.
[13:11:46] <d[^_^]b> http://jsfiddle.net/L2qurc2g/1/ updated the code
[13:11:56] <bbclover> yeah
[13:11:57] <d[^_^]b> robertmaxrees: line 78
[13:12:14] <bbclover> do you like java robertmaxrees
[13:12:17] <bbclover> or C#
[13:12:27] <robertmaxrees> bbclover i’ve done a bit of both.
[13:12:29] <d[^_^]b> when i click the 'close' button it seems to do more than one delnotification even though there's only one notification being removed
[13:13:06] <robertmaxrees> d[^_^]b “seems to” worries me - why do you think that?
[13:13:12] <d[^_^]b> i see a bunch of requests to the webserver but only expect to see one - the requests are all of the IDs of notifications, and it loops
[13:13:22] <zeroquake> Hello , i have like around 1000 card ui elements in DOM , what is better way to show/hide them based on matching search string
[13:13:36] <robertmaxrees> d[^_^]b because that click event handler should only handle the clicked one.
[13:13:37] <zeroquake> right now , am using css display property on each card
[13:13:44] <d[^_^]b> sorry i meant, definitely does. i haven't written the delnotification yet but i do see it being called a lot
[13:14:05] <robertmaxrees> d[^_^]b without seeing a functioning version, this looks like it should work fine.
[13:14:59] <d[^_^]b> i think the issue is how it has multiple notifications and they all reference a single class for the close button
[13:15:11] <robertmaxrees> that is irrelevant when closing them.
[13:15:17] <d[^_^]b> hm
[13:15:33] <robertmaxrees> unless you’re running this plugoin multiple times per page.
[13:16:04] <d[^_^]b> i am
[13:16:10] <robertmaxrees> then that’s the issue.
[13:16:25] <d[^_^]b> so line 76 should become sticky-close' + uniqID
[13:16:29] <robertmaxrees> $('.sticky-close').click(function() {}) “stacks” for every time the plugin is run.
[13:16:40] <robertmaxrees> you could get a reference to the current element through $(this) fwiw
[13:17:07] <robertmaxrees> check out the plugin patterns and see the smarter way to do this.
[13:17:15] <robertmaxrees> because you shouldn’t be referencing elements like that.
[13:17:19] <d[^_^]b> there's not a whole lot of documentation for this
[13:17:30] <robertmaxrees> for making plugins?
[13:17:32] <d[^_^]b> i'm not used to jquery - i am a 'web 1.0' guy but trying to learn
[13:17:41] <robertmaxrees> http://learn.jquery.com/plugins/
[13:17:50] <robertmaxrees> there’s an entire section of the learning center dedicated to everything about them :0
[13:18:00] <cryptoloot> robertmaxrees: are you still looking at my code or do you have additional questions?
[13:18:09] <robertmaxrees> cryptoloot i’m not writing it for you.
[13:18:13] <jmverges> hi there
[13:18:17] <robertmaxrees> this is not the right place to have somebody do that.
[13:18:21] <d[^_^]b> well no, i mean, overall i'm pretty happy with this plugin and how it works but i would like to know what the correct way to do this without accidentally stacking is
[13:18:27] <jmverges> can I ask about jquery-ui here?
[13:18:29] <arthurvr> hi jmverges!
[13:18:34] <arthurvr> jmverges: for sure!
[13:18:43] <jmverges> hi arthurvr
[13:18:45] <robertmaxrees> d[^_^]b yeah - check out the learning center section on plugins :) it’ll show you.
[13:19:13] <jmverges> ok, so I have a web page, that has an iframe. Into that iframe is loaded jQuery ui
[13:19:21] <jmverges> so, I'm using dataTables
[13:19:31] <BillCriswell> dataTables, fun
[13:19:33] <jmverges> and a plugin that uses sortable
[13:19:51] <robertmaxrees> iframes, jqui, and datatables all at once.  this is going to be awesome :)
[13:20:09] <jmverges> If I open the html of the iframe in other page
[13:20:11] <jmverges> all works fine
[13:20:16] <arthurvr> robertmaxrees: lol =)
[13:20:36] <robertmaxrees> arthurvr :D
[13:20:38] <jmverges> however, sortable is not working when I try to sort
[13:20:44] <jmverges> in the iframe
[13:20:49] <BillCriswell> jmverges: You're trying to sort a table?
[13:20:58] <jmverges> I don't know if I explain me well
[13:21:02] <jmverges> rows of a table
[13:21:08] <jmverges> that is working perfectly
[13:21:14] <jmverges> in a standalone page
[13:21:18] <BillCriswell> Yeah, you essential want <tr>s to be sortable with jQuery UI?
[13:21:26] <jmverges> yes
[13:21:28] <jmverges> that is done
[13:21:30] <BillCriswell> jmverges: Really? Awesome. I'd have assumed that wouldn't go well.
[13:21:57] <jmverges> the thing is that is not working when I navigate in a iframe
[13:22:35] <d[^_^]b> well i 'solved' my issue just by changing how the IDs are created
[13:22:54] <robertmaxrees> d[^_^]b you shoudld check out how to not rely on that instead, but awesome!
[13:22:55] <d[^_^]b> i wish i knew a better way but it's hard to just navigate huge documents on complex things like jquery :)
[13:23:21] <d[^_^]b> i tried, i've been on this for a long time and i'd rather just move on if i can find something that works
[13:23:22] <robertmaxrees> not at all.
[13:23:27] <robertmaxrees> err, okay.
[13:23:29] <jmverges> so... no one?
[13:23:55] <d[^_^]b> well you seem to know but won't help me figure out where to look, so the world is a little less well off because one more idiot continues to write bad code :)
[13:23:58] <robertmaxrees> “it works” always gets me into trouble.
[13:24:01] <robertmaxrees> i did show you...
[13:24:07] <cryptoloot> robertmaxrees: then im toast as I didn't write the example i provided. Coding is greek to me.
[13:24:21] <cryptoloot> thats why i offer payment
[13:24:24] <BillCriswell> jmverges: Too much we don't know.
[13:24:41] <d[^_^]b> the main manual page to jquery plugin howto is not 'where to look', that's like me telling you, here's the table of contents on neurochemistry, now go figure out how to create an antidepressant
[13:24:49] <robertmaxrees> cryptoloot this is a support channel, not a freelancing channel - there are freelancing channels out there, though.
[13:24:52] <BillCriswell> You can't debug it being able to see it and mess around with it, we can't see it or anything.
[13:25:23] <robertmaxrees> d[^_^]b the links that read “how to create a basic plugin” and “advanced plugin concepts” would seem like good candidates :)
[13:26:02] <robertmaxrees> i don’t know what your familiarity is with jquery and plugins, so it’s hard for me to say “you need to read about enumerating over everything you’ve selected insteD” or whatever, y’know?
[13:26:20] <jmverges> see you later
[13:26:20] <d[^_^]b> i don't have time to read a whole section that might not even help me understand based on my lack of javascript context. the issue goes both ways. i would need some key words about what to even look for there.
[13:26:32] <robertmaxrees> d[^_^]b err...
[13:26:49] <BillCriswell> lol ok
[13:26:52] <robertmaxrees> welp./
[13:27:05] <robertmaxrees> http://learn.jquery.com/plugins/basic-plugin-creation/#using-the-each-method
[13:27:08] <robertmaxrees> there you go i guess.
[13:27:57] <d[^_^]b> but wouldn't that crawl through all notifications? i only need to reference one specific object
[13:28:33] <robertmaxrees> you need to refactor all of your code so you enumerate through all the modals and initialize each one individually.
[13:29:25] <d[^_^]b> i cant though, i'm working within a larger framework, honestly i'll probably have to take a class on javascript before we rewrite it for the next version, because the person who helped me with this created a lot of bad habits.
[13:29:41] <d[^_^]b> it doesn't seem to kill anything though and, "It Works as Expected (TM)"
[13:30:09] <robertmaxrees> ‘kay
[13:30:12] <d[^_^]b> thanks for the help, i won't hold you liable when people sue me :)
[13:35:16] <daynaskully> {Q} I have a list of things that have a save button. I want to create a single cookie that stores 1 or many id's in it. I'm stuck after saving the first id. I dont' know what i should be doing to add a 2nd id and serialize it in jquery only
[13:35:44] <robertmaxrees> store a comma separated list of IDs.
[13:36:09] <robertmaxrees> then you can .split() and .join() things to go back and forth.
[13:36:47] <daynaskully> k cool, i'll give it a whirl
[13:36:52] <daynaskully> thx
[13:36:54] <robertmaxrees> fsho
[13:42:06] <msafi> Can I turn off a jQuery event like this http://jsfiddle.net/dfpc9top/ ?
[13:42:28] <msafi> Like saving the results of .on() to a variable and then calling .off() on that variable?
[13:42:40] <robertmaxrees> no.
[13:42:56] <robertmaxrees> you need to save a reference to the function instead.
[13:43:28] <msafi> robertmaxrees: save a reference to the function?
[13:44:27] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/dfpc9top/1/
[13:45:15] <robertmaxrees> alternatively, don’t unbind, just check to see if you should run the handler instead.
[13:46:03] <msafi> robertmaxrees: I register hundreds of these, so I want to be as efficient as I can.
[13:46:14] <robertmaxrees> woah.
[13:46:16] <robertmaxrees> don’t do that.
[13:46:23] <robertmaxrees> do a single delegated listener instead.
[13:46:45] <cryptoloot> robert you know the freelance irc channel?
[13:46:48] <msafi> robertmaxrees: delegated listener?
[13:47:07] <robertmaxrees> cryptoloot try ##freelance
[13:47:21] <robertmaxrees> msafi $(parent).on(‘click’, ‘child’, function() {});
[13:47:32] <robertmaxrees> where parent is an element that exists on pageload.
[13:47:38] <robertmaxrees> and child is the element you care about.
[13:48:45] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/bgtjdq11/
[13:49:09] <pilgrimish> looking for some help with tallying the total width of all images and their wrappers and updating both when the browser is resized… it’s already working in safari/ff, but chrome doesn’t play nice with “auto” widths…
[13:50:03] <msafi> robertmaxrees: here's my case. I'm building an image lazy loader. so, $(window).on('scroll', function() { /* check if image is approaching view port and load it if so and when it is loaded, we don't need this listener any more, so turn it off…and the page has hundreds of images. */ })
[13:50:27] <robertmaxrees> so it’s not click events, but the scroll event?
[13:50:42] <msafi> robertmaxrees: yes, click only there to make my example easier
[13:50:52] <robertmaxrees> how many scroll event listeners do you have bound?
[13:50:54] <pilgrimish> csslance
[13:50:59] <pilgrimish> shit
[13:51:02] <msafi> robertmaxrees: 400-800
[13:51:07] <robertmaxrees> msafi that’s your problem.
[13:51:09] <robertmaxrees> only bind one.
[13:51:33] <msafi> robertmaxrees: each image registers its own window.scroll
[13:51:46] <robertmaxrees> it shouldn’t.
[13:51:49] <robertmaxrees> you should only have one.
[13:52:47] <msafi> robertmaxrees: I can't think of how that would work
[13:52:59] <robertmaxrees> can you share an example of the current code?
[13:53:26] <robertmaxrees> it sounds like, on scroll, you need to check if the “approaching” image(s) are/have been loaded and load them if not.
[13:53:27] <msafi> robertmaxrees: it's angular directive (like web component of sort…)
[13:53:55] <msafi> robertmaxrees: http://jsfiddle.net/ux402ej0/
[13:53:58] <robertmaxrees> because your issue here is the hundreds of scroll event liusteners.
[13:55:43] <msafi> robertmaxrees: what's wrong with registering hundreds listeners if they're cleaned up properly?
[13:55:59] <robertmaxrees> because you have to dispatch to hundreds of listeners for your logic.
[13:56:36] <robertmaxrees> you could very easily consolodate all that logic into a single listener instead.
[13:57:34] <msafi> I don't see how, I have to select all images on every scroll?
[13:57:48] <robertmaxrees> you have an object up front with everything in it instead.
[13:57:55] <robertmaxrees> single selector, then you do your calculations from ther.e
[13:58:35] <robertmaxrees> the scroll event is especially nasty because it fires so many times.
[13:58:53] <msafi> robertmaxrees: I debounce the handler.
[13:59:06] <robertmaxrees> the listeners are still there.
[13:59:11] <robertmaxrees> you’re still running functions :)
[13:59:19] <msafi> robertmaxrees: yeah
[13:59:37] <msafi> robertmaxrees: I still don't see how to do it once and still handle every image individually.
[14:00:09] <ilhami> $(".list-group").append('<li class="list-group-item">' + $('#url').val(); + '</li>');
[14:00:13] <ilhami> you see anything wrong with this line?
[14:01:01] <robertmaxrees> msafi i described it earlier - let me see if I can’t give you a quick example.
[14:05:01] <robertmaxrees> http://fixee.org/paste/juxtz7r/
[14:05:06] <robertmaxrees> grossly oversimplified
[14:05:44] <msafi> Okay, let me see if I can understand it
[14:05:56] <robertmaxrees> you could make this more efficient via debouncing, and add in logic for loading before it hits the bottom of the viewport.
[14:06:00] <robertmaxrees> but the basic idea should be pretty simple.
[14:06:59] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, i’d consider using a plugin instead.
[14:07:25] <robertmaxrees> http://www.appelsiini.net/projects/lazyload like this one.
[14:10:40] <msafi> I see what you're doing, robertmaxrees. For some reason, I feel that it should be easier for the browser to handle several hundred scroll events with simple calculations inside them rather than one scroll event with a giant loop inside it
[14:10:56] <msafi> That's my amateur hunch only though
[14:11:19] <msafi> Anyway
[14:11:43] <msafi> I don't have a problem with performance on my page right now (not that I have even profiled it, but I'm gonna ship it like this and wait for someone to complain, anyway)
[14:12:05] <msafi> The feel of the page on my computer is ok.
[14:12:36] <msafi> Thanks a lot for your help, robertmaxrees
[14:23:27] <Velveeta> msafi, i can give you a partial explanation of why that's lighter on the browser load
[14:24:16] <msafi> Velveeta: sure
[14:26:01] <Velveeta> actually i just scrolled back to try to skim the full context of the conversation... so your question was why 1 event binding that loops over a list of elements and does a calculation is more performant than having each element register a scroll event listener and do that same calculation right?
[14:26:27] <robertmaxrees> and adding/removing those listeners vs just leaving the one.
[14:26:58] <msafi> Velveeta: yes
[14:27:37] <Velveeta> well part of it is that you're not just firing for all of those elements on a single scroll operation... if you scroll 100px on screen, you're firing all of those scroll events for each of those elements for every scroll event received throughout those 100px worth of scrolling
[14:28:10] <Velveeta> i'm not sure if it fires every pixel or every few, but it's definitely a large multiple of those event callbacks having to be fired vs a single one on the window
[14:28:34] <Velveeta> you could take that a step further for optimization and debounce that single scroll event so that it only fires once every so many milliseconds
[14:28:46] <Velveeta> because each of those offet fetches also causes a repaint operation i believe
[14:29:34] <Velveeta> so if you debounced that event by say, 10ms, it would only fire when scrolling had stopped for 10ms at a time, which is less than the blink of an eye to the user, but helps reduce browser load tons by not firing every iteration in between
[14:31:44] <msafi> Okay, I'll take what you both are telling me on faith
[14:32:05] <msafi> Because still, it wouldn't make sense to me how it works internally since that's very advanced stuff...
[14:32:11] <Velveeta> gotcha
[14:33:04] <Velveeta> well, internally, it's very easy for it to iterate over a list of elements just check a single property of each, vs creating a new call stack frame and any other functional overhead involved with executing 1 event handler and then exiting and doing another all over again
[14:33:50] <msafi> Velveeta: hmmm, I see
[14:37:42] <Peiniger> trying to find the closest div that contains a specific attribute. the following doesnt seem to work. Am i doing something worng? .closest('div[data-hovid]');
[14:38:00] <robertmaxrees> define “closest”
[14:38:16] <Peiniger> about 8 parents up
[14:38:17] <robertmaxrees> .closest() finds the first ancestor (including the current element) that meets that criteria.
[14:38:27] <robertmaxrees> also, how was that data attribute set?
[14:38:53] <Peiniger> I see where I went wrong
[14:38:59] <robertmaxrees> oh, awesome.
[14:39:01] <Peiniger> thanks for the quick response
[14:39:33] <robertmaxrees> fsho.
[14:39:36] <robertmaxrees> what was the problem?
[14:40:44] <Peiniger> pebcak
[14:40:53] <robertmaxrees> hah.  well done then :)
[14:43:39] <Velveeta> lol
[14:44:33] <Velveeta> "also, how was that data attribute set?" -- excellent question, a lot of people don't realize it those selectors don't work for data properties set through the .data() method vs .attr()
[14:44:46] <robertmaxrees> yep.  that’s a common one.
[14:46:04] <cryptoloot>  /join #freelance
[14:49:28] <cj> moo
[14:49:41] <cj> can someone recommend a good date/time selection plugin?
[14:50:19] <Velveeta> moment.js
[14:50:25] <Velveeta> wait, selection as in form inputs?
[14:50:45] <cj> human interface widgets
[14:51:20] <Velveeta> gotcha
[14:51:41] <Cork> cj: just google jquery timepicker
[14:51:43] <Velveeta> not sure there, we roll our own at my company for date selection, have nothing for time, and outside of our own, i've only ever used jquery ui's datepicker
[14:51:53] <Cork> you should find 10+ ones
[14:52:03] <Velveeta> hey cork, long time no see
[14:52:21] <cj> Cork: I prefer humans on IRC telling me what they've had success with rather than google telling me about all of the error reports
[14:52:27] <Cork> ya, been a while
[14:52:37] <robertmaxrees> coooork!
[14:52:48] <Velveeta> you know what we need? a yelp.com for things like jquery plugins and npm modules
[14:52:53] <Cork> cj: there are comparison sites and a lot more about it
[14:53:03] <Cork> you should easily be able to find all the info you need
[14:53:39] <Cork> time pickers is a common wish
[14:54:04] <cj> cork: the info I need is human interaction.  I like hearing what other users have to say about it :-)
[14:54:12] <cj> Velveeta: I'll take a look at moment.js
[14:54:17] <Velveeta> you should also make sure that when you're creating date and time picking components, you test for native support for them, because when it comes to ios, android, and certain browsers, there are native versions that users may already be used to
[14:54:25] <Velveeta> moment isn't a date or time picker, btw
[14:54:43] <Velveeta> it's a date/time utility library, it's awesome for date and time math, but it doesn't give any UI components to work with
[14:55:09] <Velveeta> you can do things like: var foo = moment().startOf('month').add('years', 1);
[14:55:22] <Cork> Velveeta: you mean new Date() isn't enough for you? *gasp* :D
[14:55:34] <robertmaxrees> hahahahahaha
[14:55:42] <Velveeta> not the way js's date constructor is set up :D i love my moment abstraction ;)
[14:55:54] <Cork> ya, date sucks
[14:56:25] <Velveeta> but yeah, if users are on an interface system that already implements its own method for date/time selection, to provide a custom one can be jarring to their normal experience
[14:56:41] <Velveeta> you can use modernizr to test for support for date/time input formats, and polyfill where they don't exist
[14:57:30] <Cork> not sure you can actually sniff for date support
[14:57:45] <Cork> as some browsers actually parse the date type but still have no ui
[14:58:14] <Velveeta> ahhh gotcha, so it would check for support for the input type, which might have valid date validation, but no popup component for selection...?
[14:59:27] <Cork> Velveeta: dom support is normally done by setting a value and checking if that value stuck
[15:00:00] <Cork> ex. var tester = document.createElement('input'); tester.type= 'date'; return tester.type === 'date'
[15:00:03] <Velveeta> in some cases, it's also check by specific properties that are available as part of a custom input type, like .selected or whatever
[15:00:16] <Cork> ya
[15:00:23] <Velveeta> right, if a browser doesn't recognize type date, it should return type text, right?
[15:00:45] <Cork> but that it supports date doesn't mean it has a ui for it
[15:00:57] <Velveeta> right, that's what i was clarifying up above when you said that
[15:01:20] <Cork> ah, ya sorry missed part of that line
[15:01:23] <Velveeta> if it says it supports type date, it may just mean it has proper validation for date values, but not necessarily that it has some kind of pop up ui component for selection
[15:01:33] <Cork> yup
[15:01:56] <Velveeta> yeah i guess that's more important for mobile platforms anyway, since both android and ios do typically have their own components for those things
[15:02:22] <Velveeta> so having a (e.g.) jquery datepicker in place of the (e.g.) android datepicker would be non-intuitive to some android users
[15:02:28] <Cork> well if you can't know if they have it how would you implement the fallback? :D
[15:02:35] <Velveeta> i mean it *should* still be intuitive, but not part of their normal interfaces
[15:02:51] <Velveeta> i don't know, a combination of checks for mobile platform + support?
[15:03:06] <Velveeta> although i despise user agent sniffing for mobile detection
[15:03:16] <Cork> hmm actually let me check this
[15:03:33] <Velveeta> i guess i just haven't previvously considered the case where input types like date/time are supported without an associated ui component
[15:04:16] <Velveeta> we've been talking about adding code to our own date picker to only add its own component where the native functionality was missing, but now you raise an excellent point about partial support
[15:04:35] <Velveeta> or really, not *partial* support, but support without an expected ui component associated with it
[15:04:49] <wiggl3> In jQuery Mobile -- how come I can't open #mypopup after switching to a new page? http://jsfiddle.net/wiggl3/5fLszwh1/2/
[15:05:31] <Cork> yup
[15:05:38] <Cork> date is not reliable
[15:05:50] <Cork> input.type = "date" i mean
[15:05:59] <Velveeta> gotcha
[15:06:10] <Velveeta> in that case, i'll just mentally delete that part of our future roadmap ;)
[15:06:13] <Cork> in practice it might be though
[15:06:41] <Cork> as i think all desktop browsers that don't have an ui has date support disabled by default
[15:07:13] <Cork> and all mobile once support the native ui (since a long time)
[15:08:50] <Velveeta> wiggl3: your event binding seems to be correct, adding a console.log statement in that callback fires each time i change pages
[15:09:02] <Velveeta> it's gotta be something with the guts of that callback
[15:11:02] <Velveeta> oh, i found it
[15:11:12] <Velveeta> you need to pass 'open' to that popup() method
[15:11:23] <Velveeta> http://jsfiddle.net/5fLszwh1/3/
[15:12:03] <wiggl3> Velveeta: thank you!
[15:12:10] <Velveeta> your other problem is that you're duplicating that id, so on page 2, you won't see that popup, because the first #mypopup is in the page 1 section
[15:12:11] <wiggl3> i realize the popup should probably be outside of the pages
[15:12:22] <wiggl3> that's what enhancewithin is for apparently
[15:12:26] <Velveeta> and that's what'll be tried for popping up, and then not show because you're on page 2 and it's on page 1
[15:12:27] <wiggl3> Velveeta: yep
[15:12:32] <wiggl3> most right indeed
[15:12:35] <Velveeta> :)
[15:18:31] <asahi> the value of $(this).val() seems to have changed from the data option to success option in my $.ajax() call. I'm wondering what might cause this
[15:18:53] <robertmaxrees> what is $(this) ?
[15:19:20] <asahi> $("#foo")
[15:19:34] <robertmaxrees> and i assume that’s an input?
[15:19:44] <asahi> yes, it's an input
[15:20:01] <robertmaxrees> then something is changing the value.
[15:20:20] <robertmaxrees> check for calls to .val(), as well as .value
[15:21:28] <asahi> the only place where $(this) is referenced is in the data option, where I have data: { text: $(this)val() }
[15:21:37] * Velveeta grabs asahi by the neck.
[15:21:46] * Velveeta pours asahi into a glass.
[15:21:49] <robertmaxrees> asahi that’s not the only place that element can be referenced, though.
[15:22:34] <asahi> robertmaxrees: not sure what you mean...
[15:22:39] <Velveeta> asahi: can you post that function to a jsfiddle or pastebin or something?
[15:22:41] <robertmaxrees> something else can do $(‘#foo’).val()
[15:23:51] <asahi> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/ad92fa2f860ef3b58d74
[15:24:18] <Velveeta> is #listing_location an input?
[15:24:27] <asahi> yes
[15:24:33] <robertmaxrees> also, your this might not be what you’re expecting inside that ajax call.
[15:24:56] <Velveeta> right, inside the success function, 'this' should actually be the window object
[15:24:59] <Velveeta> i think
[15:25:14] <robertmaxrees> do var $this = $(this); before the ajax cann, then use $this.val() within instea.d
[15:25:16] <Velveeta> if you want it to maintain its scope, you need to $.proxy() that function, or .bind() it
[15:25:23] <robertmaxrees> or do those.
[15:25:28] <Velveeta> or yeah, what robert said
[15:25:51] <Velveeta> scope chain traversal is probably less expensive than the jquery constructor
[15:26:31] <robertmaxrees> i usually opt to do the .bind(), but without knowing what browsers they need to support...
[15:27:05] <asahi> I see. I didn't realize $(this) could change depending on the option that you're in
[15:27:23] <robertmaxrees> asahi the ‘this’ object changes depending on the function and some other things.
[15:27:38] <Velveeta> asahi: right, as you descend into other callbacks and function calls, you lose your current 'this' scope, unless you pass it along explicitly
[15:27:55] <Velveeta> damnit, i'm doing it again @shoky
[15:27:59] <Velveeta> not 'scope', context
[15:28:12] <asahi> gotcha. Thank you!
[15:41:12] <pilgrimish> looking for some help with tallying the total width of all images and their wrappers and updating both when the browser is resized… it’s already working in safari/ff, but chrome doesn’t play nice with “auto” widths… http://www.beaconnected.com/ng_site/?page_id=136
[15:42:23] <jayjo> Will server error codes always log in the console? Is there a way to hide them or should you never do that?
[15:42:32] <jayjo> From AJAX post or Get
[15:43:55] <robertmaxrees> Jayflux for external users, don’t log errors other than to say something bad happened.
[15:44:08] <robertmaxrees> woops, jayjo rather
[15:44:11] <Jayflux> :P
[15:46:20] <jayjo> robertmaxrees: I can't find how to supress it, then. I have a json response with a code of 400 if the form did not validate. Should I not send back a code and only use my own strings to figure it out?
[15:47:12] <robertmaxrees> oh you mean like 500 vs 400 and so on?  that’s fine - can’t really suppress those anyway.
[15:47:40] <jayjo> robertmaxrees: OK, and since they're all async calls, it's ok to let those stack up however many times they happen (it's single page)
[15:47:59] <robertmaxrees> that depends.  are they calls to the same resource?
[15:48:17] <rcyr> Why do some devs think that people open their JS console? :/
[15:48:32] <robertmaxrees> because we do :)
[15:49:04] <robertmaxrees> and it totally depends on why you care.
[15:49:48] <jayjo> I guess that is why I care. Seeing 10 errors makes me feel insecure. But I suppose it's correct that people don't open that
[15:49:59] <robertmaxrees> wait, errors, or 400’s?
[15:50:05] <jayjo> 400, 401
[15:50:13] <robertmaxrees> is that what you mean to respond with from your server?
[15:50:23] <jayjo> Yes
[15:50:32] <jayjo> Alright, this discussion has cleared it up for me
[15:50:32] <robertmaxrees> because that’s fine.  you just don’t want to reveal, say, status messages from your DB server.
[15:50:33] <robertmaxrees> that’s bad.
[15:50:39] <jayjo> Right
[15:50:47] <jayjo> It's just my own status codes that I sent back
[15:50:53] <robertmaxrees> word
[15:50:57] <NBhosting> sorry bit offtopic, what is this hacker trying todo  https://dpaste.de/K7fW  he send a image on reply on of of my websites ur accounts
[15:51:08] <NBhosting> ur=user
[15:51:17] <robertmaxrees> NBhosting i suggested that you run that through a particular site to gain some more info.
[15:52:00] <NBhosting> yeah i tried to open it from 1 of my test vm on a secure network, but it seems to be down, was wondering what the encoding part does
[15:52:17] <robertmaxrees> that site isn’t down.
[15:52:55] <robertmaxrees> it gives you this: https://dpaste.de/30jA#L
[15:53:22] <robertmaxrees> looks like it’s trying to inject dealply ads.
[15:54:35] <NBhosting> is that even possible trough mail?
[15:54:39] <NBhosting> from ail to web
[15:54:43] <NBhosting> mail to web
[15:54:51] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[15:54:57] <robertmaxrees> context would be helpful here.
[15:55:02] <NBhosting> he send this after creating a user account
[15:55:08] <NBhosting> as reply on the user accoount email
[15:55:14] <NBhosting> as a hidden image
[15:55:42] <NBhosting> my forms a crsf protected so it must be manual
[15:56:23] <NBhosting> what worries me is that the user ip is a dutch ip, my country
[15:57:34] <robertmaxrees> it’s probably automated.
[15:57:38] <robertmaxrees> i wouldn’t worry too much.
[15:57:53] <NBhosting> k then i need to protect my registration form with chapta
[15:58:04] <robertmaxrees> or use the google recaptcha setup
[15:58:16] <NBhosting> ill check that one
[15:58:44] <NBhosting> i reported the user do at his host, if its not a zombie PP
[15:59:07] <robertmaxrees> it’s probably just an automated setup.
[15:59:10] <robertmaxrees> really wouldn’t worry too much.
[15:59:13] <NBhosting> yeah looks like it
[15:59:35] <NBhosting> but intressting to check it out a bit, might learn something there :D
[16:01:09] <robertmaxrees> i guess.
[16:12:37] <goddard> how can i get the first item in an array of objects for example myArrayofObjectList[0] returns [ and the value of the variable is [{"blah", "blah2"}, {"blah another", "blah"}]
[16:14:57] <rcyr> goddard: Unless you have an array of arrays, your way should work.
[16:15:10] <Robdgreat> unless the variable is actually just a string
[16:15:16] <Robdgreat> and not an array
[16:16:51] <Kirito> Can you get the actual requested selector from jQuery? i.e. have $('img#foo') return "img#foo", there's prop("tagName"), but that just returns "IMG"
[16:16:56] <goddard> what if it is just a string?
[16:17:08] <goddard> jsonParse?
[17:36:19] <bbtech> How can I take this array, convert it to html and add it to a different location in the page?
[17:36:21] <bbtech> j$('select.ssField:first option:not(:selected)')
[17:36:21] <bbtech> [<option value="123">Customer Email</option>, <option value="456">Comment</option>]
[17:37:06] <bbtech> I tried adding .html() to the end but it just gives me the first element in the array
[17:37:31] <bbtech> I tried .join() on the end but it is undefined
[17:37:37] <rcyr> bbtech: Why do you want to convert it to html?
[17:37:47] <rcyr> bbtech: Just clone the nodes and put them somewhere else.
[17:37:57] <rcyr> http://api.jquery.com/clone/
[17:38:26] <bbtech> rcyr, ok, so: j$('select.ssField:first option:not(:selected)').clone()
[17:38:45] <bbtech> rcyr, but how do I add the cloned item to another html element?
[17:38:46] <rcyr> var nodes =  j$('select.ssField:first option:not(:selected)').clone();    someOtherNode.append(nodes);
[17:38:57] <rcyr> Like this ^^
[17:39:07] <bbtech> I also want to clear out someOtherNode
[17:39:10] <bbtech> I was using html() fro that
[17:39:21] <bbtech> someOtherNode.empty().append(nodes) ?
[17:39:59] <rcyr> Ah, if you want to "move" nodes, then use .detach() instead of .clone()
[17:40:21] <rcyr> I know it's not obvious, but stop thinking in terms of "HTML", you're working with nodes
[17:40:38] <bbtech> rcyr, I want to copy not move
[17:40:52] <rcyr> Ah, but you want to remove other options?
[17:41:09] <bbtech> yes
[17:41:09] <rcyr> Ahh nevermind
[17:41:20] <rcyr> Then what you said should work
[17:41:29] <bbtech> rcyr, awesome! Thank You!
[17:47:04] <robertWorkBeer> weee
[17:58:41] <bencc> does jquery uses jsonp automatically for old browser when trying to use CORS?
[17:58:47] <robertWorkBeer> nope
[17:58:58] <robertWorkBeer> not everything supports JSONP
[17:59:15] <bencc> you mean not every server?
[17:59:23] <robertWorkBeer> Application, yeah
[17:59:33] <robertWorkBeer> it’s not the server but the server-side code.
[18:00:01] <bencc> does the server need to return a string? callback("{test: 1}") or a json object?
[18:00:29] <robertWorkBeer> it needs to return a javascript object wrapped in a function call.
[18:00:43] <robertWorkBeer> the function call is usually defined by the URL.
[18:01:14] <robertWorkBeer> rip
[18:01:16] <robertWorkBeer> woops
[18:01:20] <robertWorkBeer> http://json-p.org/ this
[18:02:04] <bencc> so callback({test: 1}) instead of callback("{test: 1}")
[18:02:12] <robertWorkBeer> yes
[18:04:05] <bencc> I saw this is used somewhere
[18:04:09] <bencc> callback && callback({test: 1})
[18:04:18] <robertWorkBeer> okay?
[18:04:20] <bencc> to prevent an error when "callback" is not defined
[18:04:28] <robertWorkBeer> it should be.
[18:04:33] <robertWorkBeer> otherwise the developer isn’t thinking.
[18:04:48] <bencc> ok
[18:05:28] <boblet2> http://jsbin.com/qafoworiqo/1/edit?html,js,console - how can I return the index of a checked radio?
[18:05:35] <boblet2> keeps throwing -1 :/
[18:07:42] <robertWorkBeer> sec
[18:07:55] <robertWorkBeer> oh, heh you’re going to have some headaches here :)
[18:09:28] <robertWorkBeer> http://jsbin.com/vigifexupi/2/edit
[18:09:59] <robertWorkBeer> boblet2 .index() gets the index of the element at that level.  the inputs are all nested under the labels, so you have to go up a level to the label to get the index.
[18:10:23] <boblet2> oh
[18:10:59] <boblet2> thanks
[18:12:16] <robertWorkBeer> fsho.
[18:17:14] <andrew9183> http://jsperf.com/test-js-vs-jq
[18:17:15] <andrew9183> hehe
[18:19:19] <rcyr> andrew9183: Well, the first one doesn't seem to do the same thing as the second test...
[18:20:56] <andrew9183> ?
[18:25:02] <andrew9183> rcyr: what’s different?
[18:25:30] <rakm> if i use $.post to make a request and the request returns a file, how do I handle that response if I want to download the file?
[18:25:30] <rcyr> Why do you use .closest?
[18:27:29] <andrew9183> wasn’t my implementation
[18:27:43] <andrew9183> but it won’t work without it
[18:27:53] <andrew9183> because the input’s aren’t siblings
[19:44:59] <RonWhoCares> Is there a jquery UI feature that does the "standard select" https://harvesthq.github.io/chosen/
[19:55:29] <Velveeta_> yay! in drunk and playing poker at a bar and on irc on my phone!
[19:55:43] <Velveeta_> I'm*
[19:56:21] <Velveeta_> who needs halp!
[19:59:14] <RonWhoCares> Is there a jquery UI feature that does the "standard select" https://harvesthq.github.io/chosen/
[20:20:11] <Poison[BLX]> I'm running into something confusing with JQuery 1.11.2, I'm using $.ajax() to load a script, and then using .done() to run a couple things after. The issue I have is that the script that's being loaded doesn't appear to execute until about 2-300ms after the callback in done() is executed. Does $.ajax({dataType: 'script'}) not wait until after the script's done loading?
[20:26:46] <Velveeta_> it *should* load the script, process/execute it, and *then* execute the callback(s)
[20:28:13] <Poison[BLX]> Ah, I think I found my issue. I was apparently missing actually stashing the promise from the .ajax call there, and so .when() was just returning immediately, as it should.
[20:29:27] <Velveeta_> ahhhh ok, for a minute i thought my while world was going to come crashing down from disorder ;)
[20:29:39] <Velveeta_> whole*
[20:30:02] <Velveeta_> it's always nice when things work out the way they're supposed to
[20:30:30] <Poison[BLX]> that was kinda the feeling I was having when it looked all wrong :) ... prolific (ab)use of console.log saved the day, though.
[20:33:50] <Velveeta_> (y)
[20:34:44] <Guest85541> please suggest good free jquery treegrid
[20:35:09] <Velveeta_> what's a treegrid?
[20:35:25] <Guest85541> grid with tree structure
[20:35:34] <Guest85541> than can expand and collapse
[20:36:14] <Velveeta_> I've never heard of such a thing.... I've seen trees and grids, but never the twain have met...
[20:36:40] <Velveeta_> ahhh ok
[20:37:04] <Velveeta_> no, i don't have a suggestion for that
[20:37:06] <Guest85541> <Velveeta_> can u suggest anything?
[20:37:14] <Guest85541> <Velveeta_> k
[20:37:53] <Guest85541> please suggest good free jquery treegrid
[20:40:29] <sammich> I've used jqGrid's treegrid
[20:40:55] <jumpman> got any ideas why a click event might be firing on a parent but not its descendants?
[20:41:10] <sammich> jumpman: depends on how you've bound the listener
[20:42:09] <jumpman> $('#tags i').click(function (event) {
[20:42:50] <jumpman> i'd even settle for $('#tags span')
[20:43:34] <jumpman> does it make a difference that i've added these with .append?
[20:43:58] <jumpman> i have a codepen if you could take a look? http://codepen.io/easymac/pen/MYOGNd?editors=001
[20:44:00] <jumpman> line 178
[20:44:16] <jumpman> the element in question is the X box inside of the tags that you add
[20:44:32] <jumpman> by pressing the tag button and either clicking the +, pressing enter, pressing , , or pressing TAB
[20:44:37] <Velveeta_> if you added them with spend after you bound the click handler, that would be a problem
[20:44:53] <jumpman> shoot :l
[20:44:58] <jumpman> someone needs to make a jquery that's reactive
[20:45:08] <Velveeta_> you'd need to set it up as a delegated event listener
[20:45:24] <jumpman> can i just rebind the listener every time i add a tag
[20:45:46] <jumpman> wait
[20:45:48] <jumpman> delegate is better :D
[20:45:55] <Velveeta_> you can, but it's inefficient
[20:46:01] <Velveeta_> right
[20:46:21] <jumpman> it sounded like it was going to work from the outside of the class i'm building :p
[20:47:03] <Velveeta_> :)
[20:52:12] <jumpman> brilliant solution
[20:52:15] <jumpman> thanks very much Velveeta_
[20:52:27] <Velveeta_> no problem v:)
[20:57:51] <Guest85541> please suggest good free jquery treegrid
[20:58:05] <robertmaxrees> Trees and Grids are distinct.
[20:58:41] <Guest85541> i need grid that can expand and collapse
[20:58:54] <robertmaxrees> Have an example?
[20:59:21] <Guest85541> yes. Easy ui Tree Grid .
[20:59:43] <Velveeta_> robair: thank you
[20:59:54] <robertmaxrees> awhuaaaa?
[21:00:00] <Velveeta_> yeah you
[21:00:15] <Velveeta_> I'm at a bad playing poker and drunk
[21:00:36] <robertmaxrees> Guest85541 woah.  this is like a combo of a spreadsheet and filelist.
[21:00:37] <Velveeta_> bar*
[21:00:42] <robertmaxrees> that’s kind of uniuqe.
[21:00:58] <robertmaxrees> Velveeta niiice.  i’m hanging out in my backyard with a beer and a stogie.
[21:01:08] <Velveeta_> and just got pocket 4's, not the greatest, but i just flopped trips
[21:01:15] <robertmaxrees> nice
[21:01:18] <Guest85541> but there are plugins like that
[21:01:30] <robertmaxrees> Guest85541 have you found anything yet?
[21:01:40] <Guest85541> but each one have different problems
[21:01:55] <Velveeta_> damnit they folded
[21:02:10] <Guest85541> Easy UI getting error when i tried to load 100 rows with 8 columns
[21:02:18] <robertmaxrees> whats the error?
[21:02:28] <Guest85541> too much recursion
[21:02:37] <Guest85541> in jquery
[21:02:40] <robertmaxrees> hrmm..
[21:02:44] <robertmaxrees> can you fiddle it up?
[21:02:58] <Guest85541> k
[21:04:26] <robertmaxrees> Velveeta I never was good at any card games.
[21:05:00] <robertmaxrees> except blackjack
[21:05:11] <Velveeta_> me either, but quitters never win
[21:05:15] <Guest85541> let  me try to fidde it
[21:05:21] <robertmaxrees> hahaha
[21:05:22] <Velveeta_> and most if the time, players don't either
[21:05:56] <robertmaxrees> Guest85541 Because that error sounds like something else is going on
[21:06:19] <Guest85541> yes
[21:06:35] <tohuw> I thought a function wrapped in the blur() event would mean when focus is lost from a field, but nothing happens. If I want a field to change class when it is de-focused, how do I accomplish this? The field is not focused on load.
[21:06:36] <Guest85541> <robertmaxrees> how can i solve that
[21:06:53] <Guest85541> <robertmaxrees> upto 95 rows it is not giving any error
[21:06:57] <robertmaxrees> hrmm...
[21:07:09] <robertmaxrees> any pagination options?
[21:07:19] <robertmaxrees> !paste @ tohuw
[21:07:19] <b-ot> tohuw: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[21:07:52] <Guest85541> but i cant apply pagination in this. i need this in one page
[21:08:11] <robertmaxrees> Guest85541 sounds like you’ll need to find an alternative then i guess?
[21:08:21] <Guest85541> yes
[21:08:31] <Guest85541> or i need to solve this
[21:08:33] <Guest85541> error
[21:08:35] <robertmaxrees> hard to say without seeing the error, either way.
[21:09:28] <Guest85541> too much recursion  ...nction(a){if(a.nodeName){var b=c.noData[a.nodeName.toLowerCase()];if(b)return!(b...
[21:09:44] <Guest85541> this error comes in firebug
[21:09:46] <robertmaxrees> I mean in an example - like on the page on in a fiddle.
[21:09:58] <Guest85541> let me try.
[21:10:26] <Velveeta_> to much excursion is something else
[21:10:32] <tohuw> robertmaxrees: http://jsfiddle.net/pLkqLb23/
[21:11:26] <robertmaxrees> tohuw http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/pLkqLb23/1/ works fine.
[21:11:39] <robertmaxrees> also, when selecting things via ID, use just the ID, not the ID and Class.
[21:11:59] <robertmaxrees> since you can only have on ID on the page, there’s no point in doing anything else :)
[21:12:09] <tohuw> robertmaxrees: apologies, I just noticed that. Sorry. Also, I have to use ID.class, because this same ID appears on another page without that class
[21:12:17] <tohuw> and the script is loaded on each page
[21:12:19] <robertmaxrees> O.o
[21:12:25] <robertmaxrees> is that ID on an input?
[21:12:31] <tohuw> Yes
[21:12:41] <robertmaxrees> i’d rethink the way that’s built personally.
[21:12:42] <robertmaxrees> but OK.
[21:13:07] <tohuw> I have limited control without forking something upstream, but I think I can make it better than it is. Thank you for your input - much appreciated
[21:13:15] <robertmaxrees> sure
[21:14:14] <Velveeta_> also, Robert, go have fun, Jesus, it's Friday
[21:14:24] <Velveeta_> it's Friday right?
[21:14:35] <robertmaxrees> I am having fun hahaha
[21:14:37] <Velveeta_> to much fun, Velveeta
[21:15:10] <Poison[BLX]> I only sometimes answer to the name Jesus, but it's Saturday where I'm sitting.
[21:15:19] <robertmaxrees> boom
[21:15:31] <Velveeta_> damnit Jesus
[21:15:42] <Velveeta_> stop time time traveling to the future
[22:48:15] <jumpman> I'm extending the jQuery.fn object
[23:55:59] <nezZario> So is there really no way to dynamically load a result of a http request into my page from a cross-domain?
