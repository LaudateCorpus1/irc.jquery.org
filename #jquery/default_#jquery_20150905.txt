[00:51:24] <hd1> so hd1_done() is a function... how do I access the data.page in it?

[08:15:31] <krambal> sorry'
[08:15:33] <krambal> http://pastebin.com/33BwgpNb
[08:15:35] <krambal> i meant to past the pastbin
[08:15:53] <krambal> sorry about that everyone
[08:17:07] <krambal> rcyr i am trying to get the jquery to reload the included file
[08:18:19] <SirLagz> krambal: so you want that button to run the refresh function?
[08:18:30] <krambal> yes
[08:18:48] <SirLagz> krambal: how much javascript do you know?
[08:18:54] <krambal> very little
[08:19:42] <krambal> my console says refresh() is not a function
[08:20:04] <SirLagz> krambal: what are you trying to do? are you trying to learn javascript?
[08:20:23] <krambal> yes while developing a game for my daughter
[08:20:27] <guessx> $("#words").load("inc/display_words.php #words")
[08:20:45] <krambal> she just started kinder and i want her to be able to play this game for site words
[08:20:59] <SirLagz> krambal: right
[08:21:36] <krambal> what is SirLagz
[08:21:53] <SirLagz> krambal: just saying 'right'. as in 'ok then'
[08:21:58] <krambal> ah
[08:22:30] <decx> turn left at the next intersection. right. no left
[08:22:34] <krambal> ok so why is my console saying refrsh is not a function
[08:23:25] <guessx> unwrap it from the jQuery selector
[08:23:39] <SirLagz> krambal: because you didn't define the function. it needs to be outside the $()
[08:25:57] <krambal> um so function refresh () { then the jquery ?
[08:26:07] <SirLagz> krambal: yes
[08:28:31] <krambal> ok i did that and now its not sending anything to the console
[08:37:38] <krambal> how do i share a jsfiddle with you guys
[08:38:05] <krambal> https://jsfiddle.net/#&togetherjs=Ru2sPK62D6
[08:38:51] <derstrom> PHP won't work on jsfiddle.net
[08:39:02] <krambal> right i know
[08:39:17] <krambal> all i am trying to do is get it to reload the php part
[08:39:48] <derstrom> And nothing happens?
[08:40:02] <krambal> correct
[08:41:20] <derstrom> I'd suggest removing the $(function() { ... } and have the .click handler inside the refresh() function directly.
[08:44:20] <krambal> ok now i am getting a response in the console
[08:44:21] <krambal> jquery-latest.min.js:4 GET http://localhost/word_ap/inc/display_words.php 500 (Internal Server Error)
[08:45:00] <krambal> by working with your suggestion derstrom
[08:45:03] <derstrom> That's coming directly from your PHP script.
[08:45:26] <derstrom> Since your JavaScript is returning its output
[08:45:43] <krambal> so my phpscript is working initially
[08:45:50] <derstrom> your javascript is now working fine, yes
[08:45:59] <derstrom> You'll need to check the error logs on the server (if you can) to see what the cause of the 500 error is.
[08:46:10] <krambal> ya i can
[08:46:17] <derstrom> OK check that :)
[08:47:08] <krambal> is it because it is trying to run the function again ?
[08:47:10] <krambal>  PHP Fatal error:  Call to a member function query() on a non-object in C:\\Bitnami\\wampstack-5.5.28-0\\apache2\\htdocs\\word_ap\\inc\\display_words.php on line 14, referer: http://localhost/word_ap/ap.php
[08:47:44] <krambal> the php works when the page is loaded
[08:48:08] <krambal> because its in an include(inc/dispaly_word.php);
[08:48:20] <derstrom> The problem suggests $conn is not instantiated.
[08:51:44] <krambal> so woudl that mean i need to reinclude the connection file ?
[08:54:15] <fas3r> hello
[08:54:50] <fas3r> it's not possible to do : $(".element").hasClass("specific-class").on("click", function() { ... } ); ?
[08:54:54] <derstrom> krambal: got disconnected. So what I mean by not instantiated is i.e. $conn = new PDO(...)
[08:55:22] <feodoran> if I create a button with jquery, why does it not run the function associated to the buttons id? http://jsfiddle.net/0vgaqkqw/2/
[08:55:22] <krambal> hmmm
[08:55:39] <derstrom> That's the only possible reason why the query() method wouldn't exist on $conn.
[08:55:51] <derstrom> but this is a PHP issue now :)
[08:57:23] <fas3r> feodoran: if I'm not mistaken it 's because the event doesnot exist when the button is create dynamically.
[08:58:00] <feodoran> fas3r: is there a way to fix this?
[08:58:19] <derstrom> you could do $('body').on('click', '.dynamically-added', function() { .. })
[08:58:44] <guessx> change it to live instead of click will work
[08:58:55] <fas3r> feodoran: you have to add a callback on the new button.
[09:00:11] <fas3r> guessx: you talk about my problem ?
[09:01:20] <fas3r> derstrom: right ...
[09:01:54] <guessx> fas3r: yep, but it doesnt seem to work
[09:02:07] <fas3r> guessx: nop :)
[09:02:52] <krambal> ya its clearing the div but it is not reloading the file i think
[09:03:16] <fas3r> I think it's because the selector is already on a class. However, I just tried to add the selector of the specific class in the "on" ( like : . on('click', 'spec-class', function(){...}); ) but the result is the same.
[09:03:55] <krambal> i am getting no php errors but not loading the file in now
[09:04:23] <fas3r> krambal: ajax ?
[09:05:01] <krambal> ya
[09:05:57] <fas3r> krambal: PDO ? did you create a custom class for the connection ?
[09:06:20] <guessx> fas3r: .live was taken away on ver 1.7
[09:06:27] <feodoran> fas3r: what exactly do you mean by adding a callback? onClick=somefunction() ?
[09:06:34] <krambal> yes
[09:06:35] <fas3r> guessx: yes it was replace by "on"
[09:06:52] <fas3r> krambal: how do you initialize the connection to the DB ? in a constructor ?
[09:07:12] <krambal> $data = $conn->query('SELECT word FROM word ORDER BY RAND('.mt_rand(1,1000000000).') LIMIT 4');
[09:07:22] <fas3r> before that.
[09:08:00] <krambal> http://pastebin.com/jqxpY2ed
[09:08:03] <fas3r> does $conn is the PDO object ?
[09:08:05] <fas3r> ok I look
[09:08:27] <krambal> let me pastbin it all
[09:08:38] <fas3r> ok.
[09:08:45] <krambal> http://pastebin.com/p4dtu6Kp
[09:10:51] <derstrom> perhaps the PDO connection is being closed after the first closing ?> tag? I could be totally wrong on that though.
[09:11:09] <fas3r> do you use jquery ?
[09:11:28] <derstrom> Althoguh, krambal, this is a PHP issue now, so you will get a better answer at ##php
[09:12:46] <guessx> fas3r: $(document).on("click", "#alert", function() { - that works
[09:12:57] <derstrom> Krambal: What I would suggest you do though is put the PDO connection code just above the line where you're using query().
[09:14:00] <krambal> ya i am using jquery fas3r
[09:14:25] <fas3r> krambal: POST method, with json as datatype ?
[09:15:00] <krambal> not really sure what that means
[09:15:40] <fas3r> krambal: how do you submit your form or what ever you send to php with AJAX jquery
[09:16:21] <krambal> i dont really want to send anything to my php i just want to reload the php file so it will grab new words
[09:18:04] <krambal> i am basicly just trying to reload the page so it grabs new words but i dont want it to reload the entire page so i can store correct and wrong answers in a variable then after 10 or so questions it updates it to the user table to track how many they got right and wrong
[09:18:09] <derstrom> krambal is using GET method, not sending any additional data
[09:20:10] <fas3r> guessx: do you know why it's working when the selector is on document ?
[09:24:12] <guessx> fas3r: not sure sorry
[09:24:41] <fas3r> :)
[09:27:11] <efral3> how do I make dynamically name objects? why isnt this correct, what am i missing?
[09:27:14] <feodoran> still does not work: http://jsfiddle.net/0vgaqkqw/3/
[09:33:51] <decx> inline events can only access the global scope
[09:37:46] <feodoran> and I solve this how?
[09:39:46] <rindolf> efral3: where?
[09:39:57] <rindolf> efral3: are you speaking about varvarname?
[09:40:14] <guessx> feodoran, id just assign it an id instead of using onclick
[09:40:58] <feodoran> guessx: that's what I tried before
[09:41:29] <feodoran> http://jsfiddle.net/0vgaqkqw/2/
[09:44:22] <guessx> https://jsfiddle.net/0vgaqkqw/3/
[09:45:55] <guessx> sorry http://jsfiddle.net/u12w4dLw/
[09:48:11] <feodoran> thx
[09:57:40] <krambal> ok so i decided to attack this a different way
[09:58:16] <krambal> load 10 problems with 9 of them hidden then after the correct answer is selected hide that div and show the next one
[09:59:01] <krambal> do you think that will work ?

[14:24:53] <Lightsword> I have a site with a 2 Factor Authentication system but I want to hide the 2FA field on my login page unless the account actually has 2FA enabled, 2FA status can be checked by posting check2fa=username to my login page and it will respond with true or false, I want the check2fa request to be sent when the user moves their cursor off of the username form box after typing their username, how would I go about doing this?
[15:00:57] <Kartagis> Lightsword: and click somewhere else?
[15:01:13] <Kartagis> hence, lose focus
[15:01:19] <Lightsword> Kartagis, so focusout?
[15:01:24] <Kartagis> blur
[15:02:37] <Lightsword> Kartagis, whats the difference, between that and focusout?
[15:02:58] <Kartagis> I don't know what focusout does
[15:03:39] <Kartagis> I think you can use focusout as an html tag attribute
[15:03:44] <Kartagis> or property
[15:04:00] <Kartagis> I can never remember which is which
[15:04:03] <Lightsword> yeah, seemed that worked for that part, I’m trying to get the post working now
[15:08:37] <rcyr> focusout is a blur that bubbles
[15:08:46] <rcyr> focusin is a focus that bubbles
[15:21:41] <krambal> how do you run an external function in the document.ready function?
[15:21:49] <krambal> i just need to load it inside there to start the chain
[15:24:32] <krambal> http://pastebin.com/WPLA5V0Q
[15:54:40] <asidjazz> $(document).ready(function() { in here } );
[15:54:54] <asidjazz> krambal: you need to learn css transitions
[15:55:36] <krambal> what do you mean by that asidjazz
[15:55:45] <asidjazz> you shouldnt be fadeing via JS
[15:55:59] <asidjazz> tiny example
[15:56:08] <asidjazz> take a div, make it <div class="krambal off"></div>
[15:56:31] <asidjazz> .krambal { transition: opacity 1s linear; }
[15:56:40] <asidjazz> .off { opacity: 0; }, .on { opacity: 1; }
[15:56:51] <asidjazz> use JS to swap the classes on and off
[15:57:10] <asidjazz> using CSS transitions lets teh GPU control the animation, smoother, nicer, the future.
[15:57:25] <asidjazz> you want a delay?
[15:57:34] <asidjazz> transition: opacity 1s linear 4s;
[15:57:35] <krambal> ya and i need it to chain to the next div
[15:58:03] <asidjazz> so you increase the delay for each div in CSS
[15:58:15] <asidjazz> transition: opacity 1s linear 1s; transition: opacity 1s linear 2s;
[15:58:42] <asidjazz> then all your JS has to do is $('.classofalldivs').removeClass('off').addClass('on');
[16:01:54] <krambal> asidjazz, this is the first step after i get them displaying i have to get them to play a sound while they are displaying
[16:02:05] <krambal> then i need them to display randomly in the box
[16:02:16] <krambal> and i need it to run the 10 words 3 times
[16:31:49] <Lightsword> how do I get jquery to post regular form data?
[16:32:51] <rcyr> That's what it does by default when using $.post or even $.ajax
[16:47:17] <Lightsword> rcyr, any idea why I would be getting a 302 redirect every time I try and post? https://gist.github.com/jameshilliard/1642053d2759b1b95371#file-login-php-L54
[16:48:08] <rcyr> AFAIK, XML just follows redirects
[16:48:17] <rcyr> Err
[16:48:18] <rcyr> XHR
[16:48:24] <rcyr> Sorry for having written XML
[16:48:57] <Lightsword> rcyr, why would it be redirecting?
[16:49:20] <Lightsword> https://gist.github.com/jameshilliard/1642053d2759b1b95371#file-login-php-L9 is the response
[16:49:23] <rcyr> I have no idea, redirects are done server-side
[16:49:40] <Lightsword> rcyr, I have no idea why that would generate a 302
[16:49:47] <Lightsword> its just an echo
[16:49:51] <rcyr> Where do you specify the URL?
[16:50:05] <Lightsword> rcyr https://gist.github.com/jameshilliard/1642053d2759b1b95371#file-login-php-L51
[16:50:11] <rcyr> actionurl seems unused

[16:50:59] <rcyr> lol
[16:51:00] <rcyr> haha
[16:51:33] <Lightsword> rcyr, yeah, removing it didn’t change anything though, Im using static test-data right now
[16:52:11] <rcyr> $.post needs a URL
[16:52:17] <rcyr> You need to provide one.
[16:52:35] <Lightsword> rcyr, doesn’t var form = e.this ; do that?
[16:52:40] <rcyr> No
[16:52:51] <rcyr> It doesn't even make sense.
[16:53:28] <Lightsword> rcry, well its actually posting to the right place
[16:53:41] <Lightsword> var form = "/index.php?p=login"; doesn’t seem to change anything though
[16:54:11] <Lightsword> it works ok when I copy the curl from the debugger
[16:54:17] <Lightsword> but I can’t figure out where the 302 is coming from
[17:41:39] <asidjazz> Lightsword: are oyu one-handed
[17:42:17] <Lightsword> no…..
[17:50:35] <Insentience> which is preferred: $.parseXML(xml) or simply using $(xml)

[21:27:36] <tash> window.open() is what I thought I should try, but it's opening in a new tab in FF and IE.  But, I don't know if that is because my browser settings or if I'm just not using the right thing.

[23:11:44] <viju> Hi, is there a way to synchronize two ore more AJAX-es  such that one executes after the completion of the other?
[23:12:14] <whirledpress> deferreds?
[23:12:43] <viju> I am not sure what that means.
[23:14:25] <viju> The output from one ajax maybe needed for the 2nd ajax (but not necessarily).
[23:15:09] <whirledpress> I haven't done Ajax in jquery for a while, but I figured you could wrap the ajax call in a function that you called when a deferred promise is resolved.
[23:15:30] <whirledpress> I think AJax has deferreds built in, but I would need to look it up.
[23:15:42] <viju> I'd like to know.
[23:16:25] <viju> I am reading https://api.jquery.com/jquery.deferred/
[23:16:33] <whirledpress> http://www.htmlgoodies.com/beyond/javascript/making-promises-with-jquery-deferred.html
[23:16:47] <viju> Ah okay.
[23:16:54] <whirledpress> they give ajax examples.
[23:17:43] <claytonzaugg> is there a best practices for scanning all the images in a folder, getting their paths, and returning those paths into an array for access to each url to the image?
[23:18:25] <whirledpress> You may want to use php for part of that.
[23:19:18] <claytonzaugg> even if it's a meteor app?
[23:19:34] <whirledpress> Don't know if js/jquery has the ability to scan a directory. Have no idea what a meteor app is.
[23:21:13] <claytonzaugg> Thanks whirledpress, was hoping someone may know, but you're right, it'll be a js question specifically.  Off to that channel!
[23:21:29] <whirledpress> to do what you are asking, in the past I have written a short script in php that runs scandir and filters results for images and echoes the urls to the images in json format. Then I used ajax to get the urls
[23:21:55] <Saturn812> ewww php
[23:21:56] <claytonzaugg> Okay thanks, I'll look into that if I can't find a solution within meteor or js.
[23:22:41] <pyCasso> can a variable be defined for an ajax response?
[23:22:41] <whirledpress> I stepped in it, sorry. Thought I wiped my shoes off before coming to this channel.
[23:22:55] <pyCasso> can a GLOBAL variable be defined for an ajax response?
[23:23:20] <whirledpress> you can assign a global variable in your ajax success handler.
[23:26:58] <whirledpress> checkout this link, pyCasso, it has some good info about ajax
