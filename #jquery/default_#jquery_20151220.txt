[06:37:57] <jj15> Is there a match() method on jQuery objects? $(html).match(...) for example? Or would I have to use $(html).html().match()?
[06:45:46] <jj15> nvm solved.
[07:51:03] <Kartagis> can I prevent a scroll up given pageYOffset or whether a particular div has been appended?
[12:21:35] <gforce> hi all ! my name is arunav. I saw this organization's name in the GSoC accepted organizations list and I was interested in contributing to it after going through the work it's doing. I'd be glad if you could tell me how I could start contributing as a student. Thank you :)
[12:22:14] <Cthulhux> check the todo and do!
[12:38:38] <Glaisher> How do I get the html of an <a> element? $('<a/>').html() seems to give only the text.
[12:43:22] <phyrexia> hello all.
[12:43:27] <phyrexia> What am I doing wrong here?
[12:43:36] <phyrexia> https://bpaste.net/show/68c0c87f9a67
[12:43:43] <phyrexia> The dictionaries show fine in the console
[12:43:48] <phyrexia> Yet I can't receive them in my view.
[12:44:00] <phyrexia> I'm not sure if it's django related because http://stackoverflow.com/questions/29454861/how-to-send-dictionary-back-to-django-view
[15:09:50] <lindii_> any idea how can i match this json errors with each form input https://jsfiddle.net/DTcHh/15418/
[15:12:38] <dsc_> in a <form> I have 2 inputboxes, if _none_ of them have input, it should display that "required=true" validation popup box
[15:12:51] <dsc_> but if one of them has input, it may pass. How could I achieve this?
[15:13:10] <dsc_> (partly a bootstrap question)
[17:57:18] <printForever> https://jsfiddle.net/pz8d9ktn/
[17:57:35] <printForever> can anyone debug this?
[17:57:45] <printForever> the value is not returned after click
[18:01:37] <printForever> Cork?
[18:06:35] <printForever> is everyone's keyboard frozen?
[18:07:09] <printForever> its 11 lines of jQuery code, and 5 that actually do something
[18:08:47] <arc_> idk if i'll ever get used to the audacity some people have when asking for help
[18:09:18] <rcyr> arc_: Remember, we're paid to do it... so it's just normal.
[18:09:54] <printForever> idk if I'll ever get used to the silent treatment here on the forum, if you took the time to log in to the channel I don't see what's the problem with replying with 1 line of text
[18:10:02] <printForever> *form = channel
[18:10:30] <arc_> if no one idled on irc, you would be the only person in here when you were asking for help
[18:10:47] <arc_> as far as this code goes, i'm not sure why you're doing this. it seems like you just want placeholder text
[18:10:52] <printForever> also, remember that one "friendly community ready to help"
[18:10:53] <arc_> which you can achieve by using the placeholder attribute
[18:11:01] <printForever> not really friendly or ready to help
[18:11:03] <arc_> on your input field
[18:11:17] <printForever> an I asked the question 24h ago, and wiatied for a long time, and no one replied
[18:11:40] <printForever> you can't style placeholder correctly
[18:11:42] <arc_> i tried to look at it, but you expired the pastebin so your code was no longer visible
[18:11:57] <printForever> its the same thing, I've posted a fiddle
[18:12:57] <arc_> your input field doesn't have a title
[18:13:16] <printForever> it's storing the value into the title when you click
[18:13:42] <arc_> i don't see where it's doing that
[18:14:33] <printForever> on focus it removes the value
[18:14:46] <arc_> yeah, i can see that
[18:15:35] <printForever> on blur, if val is empty it takes value from the attr title
[18:16:49] <arc_> yes, that would reset the placeholder text to the default if there were a title attribute in your input field, but there isn't
[18:17:07] <arc_> https://jsfiddle.net/pz8d9ktn/1/
[18:17:21] <printForever> https://jsfiddle.net/pz8d9ktn/2/
[18:17:42] <arc_> yes, you could also do that
[18:18:25] <lindii_> any idea how can i match this json errors with each form input https://jsfiddle.net/DTcHh/15418/
[18:55:17] <azy> i'm trying to getjson an external website. i can't because of cross-site protections somewhere. halp
[18:55:33] <azy> im not sure if it's an apache issue or a firefox one
[18:59:50] <rcyr> You can't load data from another domain unless 1) it supports CORS or 2) JSONP
[19:01:19] <azy> i'm trying to load json, specifically this: https://steamcommunity.com/id/2Brainz/inventory/json/730/2
[19:06:20] <rcyr> Might be impossible to do from the browser :(
[19:06:32] <azy> :'(
[19:07:11] <rcyr> azy: You might have to use PHP or your favorite server-side language
[19:07:51] <azy> yeah i already have been, it'd just be way nicer with javascript
[19:11:46] <jj15> cd casperjs
[19:12:07] <jj15> oops wrong window. Damn i3 and the mouse switching windows.
[19:50:13] <surial> $.each(elem.attr("class").split(/\s+/), function() { <-- this crashes in IE11.
[19:50:37] <surial> Any idea why / how do I scan each class for a given element?
[19:52:07] <surial> nevermind, found the actual culprit: string.startsWith doesn't exist on IE11.
[19:52:09] <surial> It's.. not part of spec?
[19:52:17] <surial> what should I do instead? .indexOf(needle) != -1?
[19:52:21] <surial> er, == 0?
[20:19:03] <arc_> surial it seems like you pretty much know what you're doing so i don't think i have anything to contribute to your question, but i am curious why you need to do that
[20:19:15] <surial> .startsWith?
[20:19:18] <surial> For a million reasons.
[20:19:32] <arc_> scanning each class for a given element
[20:19:55] <surial> there's a name_FOO class in there, where FOO is an id, I need that.
[20:20:15] <arc_> i see
[20:20:24] <arc_> is this for a userscript or something
[20:21:19] <surial> no, my own app.
[20:21:58] <surial> I could also transfer this data via a self-invented attribute but this sounds icky to me (not that this is much nicer, but, still), and in this case shoving an display:none span in there with a class whiose contents are the dat ais also inconvenient.
[20:34:23] <arc_> surial i think others would recommend that if you are trying to store some data in an element, you should use .data()
[20:34:34] <surial> no, the server has to send this.
[20:34:36] <surial> with the page.
[20:34:45] <shoky> then data-* attributes
[20:34:48] <shoky> and read them with .data()
[20:35:08] <arc_> right
[20:35:11] <shoky> and you can still select them in css if you really want to
[20:35:57] <shoky> er nevermind my last comment, i misread
[21:01:22] <lindii_> is there any other better way to do this https://jsfiddle.net/DTcHh/15422/
[21:03:48] <lichenx1> Hello
[21:06:29] <lichenx1> Does anyone know if it's possible to get the json array name printed out?

[23:06:46] <rawburt> I see how I can use .text() to change the text in an element, but how can I add HTML to it?
[23:07:05] <rawburt> might need help finding this kind of information more than anything.
[23:07:16] <rawburt> totally new to jQuery.
[23:07:39] <arc_> .append() / .appendTo() / .prepend() / .prependTo()
[23:08:16] <rawburt> well, that seems simple..
[23:08:23] <rawburt> !arc_++
[23:09:09] <rawburt> thank you arc, I will check those out now
[23:14:47] <iateadonut> i'm trying to find prevAll() AND the children() of prevAll(), wherever the first 'input' is.
[23:15:21] <iateadonut> so prevAll('input') works sometimes, but in other cases it would be a children('input') of prevAll() instead
[23:17:12] <iateadonut> so the input i'm looking for is sometimes prevAll().children('input') and at other times prevAll('input')
[23:25:03] <iateadonut> (i did ... if prevAll('input').length ... )
