[00:00:18] <Cork> hellier: best option is to have an object you store the properties on instead
[00:00:26] <Cork> varinit =
[00:00:28] <Cork> opps
[00:00:50] <Cork> var init = 'foo', v = {}; v[init] = new SOME();
[00:01:09] <Cork> v.foo.whatEver()
[00:01:32] <hellier> hmmph, suppose thats better
[00:01:41] <hellier> ty
[00:09:54] <Dreamstiffler> hi can anyone help me to shorten this? Im new to jquery
[00:09:55] <Dreamstiffler> http://pastebin.com/bAccUZNd
[00:10:32] <Cork> Dreamstiffler: give the elements a class and use that
[00:11:19] <Cork> or you could wrap the child elements in an element and do it that way
[00:11:34] <Cork> Dreamstiffler: http://jsfiddle.net/vfqgr1s0/ provide the relevant html
[00:11:42] <Dreamstiffler> Cork: Let me try that. Im new to drupal too. I do not have access to the direct html. The form is built by Drupal UI. Give me few minutes to test it out
[00:20:06] <jnz> hi
[00:20:18] <jnz> i am seeing an unusual result from using .each
[00:20:31] <jnz> i have 4 elements, and it's looping through 5
[00:20:39] <jnz> it's pulling 5 out of somewher
[00:20:44] <Kartagis> jnz: jsfiddle?
[00:21:07] <jnz> umm
[00:21:20] <Cork> jnz: you're selector most likely matches more elements then you expect
[00:21:31] <Cork> but ya a jsfiddle is needed
[00:21:38] <jnz> i tried using unique() as well
[00:21:47] <jnz> but still tried to do something on an element twice
[00:22:06] <Cork> a jsfiddle is needed <--
[00:22:27] <Cork> show the code instead of talking about what it is suppose to do
[00:23:12] <Erwat> Cork: the code is supposed to render a raytraced rich 3d world with real time weather effects and simulated physics
[00:23:18] <Erwat> so far i'm at console.log("hello");
[00:23:22] <Uhkis> :D
[00:23:24] <Erwat> can you fix pls?
[00:23:26] <Cork> :)
[00:28:00] <Erwat> i really dislike chrome ui
[00:28:21] <Cork> chrome ui or chromes ui?
[00:28:25] <Erwat> the omnibar how it works is terrible; tabs bunching together infinitely small is terrible
[00:28:27] <Erwat> chrome's ui
[00:28:48] <Erwat> settings are terrible
[00:28:49] <Cork> i definitely agree with the omnibar thing
[00:29:01] <Erwat> the dev tools are nice though
[00:29:07] <Erwat> like that ui is pretty okay
[00:29:27] <jnz> it's hard to replicate in jfiddle
[00:29:28] <Erwat> but the omnibar randomly suggests me shit
[00:29:47] <Cork> jnz: paste the code at least
[00:29:48] <Erwat> when i type imgur.com and press enter it opens something i have bookmarked on imgur
[00:29:53] <Cork> me might be able to spot it from there
[00:30:08] <Cork> Erwat: lol lovely
[00:30:15] <Erwat> stuff like that is absolutely horrendous
[00:30:25] <Uhkis> imgur, ctrl+enter
[00:30:30] <Erwat> also the fact taht tabs bunch together and you can't tell what is what if you ahve too many of them open
[00:30:31] <Uhkis> firefox <3
[00:30:47] <Erwat> firefox is a lot nicer in that aspect but it's also slower and crashes fully
[00:31:03] <Cork> if you have a lot of tabs firefox beats chrome hands down
[00:31:03] <Uhkis> it's slower now?
[00:31:04] <Erwat> and i cant move the refresh button where i want to move it to
[00:31:07] <ddv> how can I get the first child in this situation? $('some element').closest('tr') children(':first-child') seems too long
[00:31:14] <Erwat> Uhkis: now? it's been for a long ass time
[00:31:32] <Erwat> chrome rendered 3d stuff fine smoothly firefox was chugging along freezing every second or so
[00:31:34] <Uhkis> Erwat: last time i checked, ff was way faster than chrome
[00:31:35] <Cork> Erwat: that statement isn't universally true
[00:31:41] <Erwat> yeah it isn't
[00:31:48] <Erwat> it's just true in the cases where you actually want it to be faster
[00:31:58] <Erwat> or well, where i want it to be faster
[00:32:02] <Cork> no i mean it depends on the use case, and the browser and so on
[00:32:20] <Erwat> but there are only two browsers out there anyway
[00:32:23] <Cork> browsers are quite complext today and you get quite big differences from user to user
[00:32:24] <Erwat> firefox and chrome
[00:32:34] <Dreamstiffler> Cork: I tried copying it but its too many. The shortener worked. Im not sure if its perfect. But it worked. But I have one problem. Let me explain what i want to do.
[00:32:36] <Cork> that works anywhere ya
[00:32:49] <Erwat> it was a joke at how ie is terrible
[00:32:57] <Cork> ddv: first child or first element of the match?
[00:33:11] <Erwat> IE has autocorrect turned on by default ON desktop - it is autocorrect of the region and date you have selected in windows
[00:33:24] <Erwat> not the display language, the language of the date and currency
[00:33:25] <Cork> Dreamstiffler: provide the asked for info in the fiddle i shared with you
[00:33:33] <Erwat> so for me it started autocorrecting english words into estonian
[00:33:34] <Dreamstiffler> Cork: I have a drop down. Each selection of these drop down displays a different set of checkboxes. Which the last checkbox will be the 'Other' box. So if this box is checked, a textbox will  appear. This part I have done succesfully
[00:33:37] <Cork> Dreamstiffler: provide the asked for info in the fiddle i shared with you
[00:34:04] <Erwat> and that was on by default
[00:34:05] <ddv> Cork: the tr contains as a first element a input, I want the input element
[00:34:26] <Dreamstiffler> Cork: 2nd part is, when i select other options from the drop down, the checkbox will be unchecked and the textbox for other will be hidden (.hide). Which i have done this just now.
[00:35:09] <Cork> ddv: so $('some element') matches an element somewhere in the tr?
[00:35:22] <Cork> and you want the input from the first td?
[00:35:37] <Dreamstiffler> Cork: 3 part is that, lets say i return back to the first selection on the checkbox, and wants to click the 'Others' button again, the first click will tick the box...but wouldnt display the text box. I have to uncheck and check again to display the textbox. So whats the deal here
[00:35:49] <Cork> Dreamstiffler: please stop writing a novel in the channel
[00:36:03] <ddv> Cork: I have a anchor element within a td, above the td I have a tr, so I do something like $(this).closest('tr) and then I want the input in the tr
[00:36:20] <Cork> ok
[00:36:30] <Dreamstiffler> Cork: ok let me try again...i didnt read your msg earlier
[00:36:33] <Cork> $(this).closest('tr').find('input:eq(0)')
[00:36:43] <ddv> Cork: ah ok, thanks
[00:43:49] <Dreamstiffler> Cork: I cant copy from drupal its too long. Problem is part of the original jquery is by drupal itself. I am just doing a tweak to it, I have just one last minor issue. Which is when i select back a previous dropdown selection, when i check the 'Others' checkbox, the text box wont appear. I have to uncheck and check it again for it to appear.
[00:44:03] <Cork> Dreamstiffler: i dind't ask for all of it
[00:44:14] <Cork> but the part of the html relevant to the js is needed
[00:44:30] <Cork> the structure it has depends on how you can simplify the code
[00:44:36] <Dreamstiffler> Cork: correct but i dont have the jquery thats used by drupal or unsure how to get it
[00:44:42] <Dreamstiffler> Cork: ok ok lemme try again
[00:45:22] <Cork> Dreamstiffler: just grab the section of html from the browser
[00:45:54] <Dreamstiffler> Cork: I did...its very messy. im trying to make it work. but it didnt.
[00:46:20] <Cork> Dreamstiffler: so paste the messy html, we can't really help you without it
[00:46:25] <Dreamstiffler> Cork: the one i created before i realized u gave me a jsfiddle link. http://jsfiddle.net/bucwok8j/
[00:46:34] <Cork> you forgot to hit save
[00:46:39] <Cork> *update
[00:47:43] <Dreamstiffler> im telling u this doesnt work tho
[00:47:44] <Dreamstiffler> http://jsfiddle.net/bucwok8j/1/
[00:48:11] <Dreamstiffler> the checkbox is supposed to be there for each dropdown selection
[00:48:31] <Dreamstiffler> Cork: But thats the script i didnt have. Which is within drupal.
[00:48:52] <Dreamstiffler> Cork: so i cant quite replicate my problem here.
[00:54:44] <Cork> Dreamstiffler: http://jsfiddle.net/bucwok8j/3/
[00:54:50] <Cork> something like that?
[00:56:32] <Dreamstiffler> Cork: im not sure im gna apply it to my drupal and see. As i said the link i gave earlier couldnt replicate my issue. Just seein my luck if your fix fixd my issue
[00:56:55] <Dreamstiffler> Cork: hold on loadins slow
[00:57:09] <Cork> Dreamstiffler: note i changed the html structure
[00:57:36] <Uhkis> Cork: Drupal's gonna say no to that
[00:57:44] <Cork> Uhkis: not really
[00:57:55] <Cork> adding a wrapper element around a section isn't too hard
[00:58:09] <Cork> depending on where this section is generated though
[00:58:32] <Cork> but he managed to add classes to the elements so i don't think it will be a big problem
[00:58:39] <Dreamstiffler> Cork: Nope not quite it. Actually this fix, doesnt hide the textbox. Let me try to simplify my code if i can. Pls stay.
[00:59:04] <Cork> Dreamstiffler: the code looks for the <div class="wrapper"> i added
[00:59:17] <Cork> if you don't replicate that part you won't have a working change
[01:00:00] <Dreamstiffler> Cork: i saw. althogh not sure what .first is. Let me try replicate the issue. To also see if its a drupal issue or what. Its quite hard to explain. But pretty simple thing.
[01:00:21] <Cork> Dreamstiffler: .nextAll() returns all siblings after the element matching the selector
[01:00:31] <Dreamstiffler> Cork: i just need the checkbox to be reset. Its not reset at the moment. Just unchecked.
[01:00:40] <Cork> that is so it doesn't break just case something (ex a br) is inserted inbetween
[01:00:51] <Cork> but as you only want the closest after you need to use .first()
[01:01:11] <Dreamstiffler> Cork: Ok hold on master. Im trying. To get you best example.
[01:01:14] <Cork> Dreamstiffler: uh, then you haven't replicated the structure
[01:01:17] <Cork> cause it does in the fiddle
[01:01:53] * Cork loves blind flying...
[01:02:23] <Uhkis> Dreamstiffler: is this a custom module FAPI code or form created via ui?
[01:03:20] <Dreamstiffler> Uhkis: no idea what FAPI is. but yes the form and part jquery for the form is created by drupal. Hold on dont pressure a noob. i might break
[01:04:53] <andrew9183> FAPI sounds funny
[01:05:23] <Uhkis> andrew9183: yeah, depends on where you cut it
[01:07:29] <Erwat> hey is there some magic number considered to be under which you would want to have your request amount on load?
[01:08:36] <andrew9183> seriously Erwat
[01:08:48] <andrew9183> you asked in other channel and received response, what else do you wan t?
[01:08:48] <jnz> figured it out
[01:08:49] <jnz> ^^
[01:09:09] <Erwat> andrew9183: but i didn't, i got "well it depends" and "you should do X", but not an actual number
[01:09:22] <andrew9183> theres no magic number dude
[01:10:20] <Uhkis> except 42
[01:11:38] <adam-c> hello :)
[01:12:04] <Omar-> hi adam-c
[01:12:58] <Erwat> there more than likely is, it's just not talked about as much
[01:13:19] <Erwat> kinda like drawcalls
[01:22:11] <Dreamstiffler> Cork: Uhkis : FInally i got it working. But it doesnt replicate my issue. Possibly drupal using diff code. Just have a look at http://jsfiddle.net/bucwok8j/12/ this is exactly what i want to do.
[01:23:48] <Dreamstiffler> Cork: Uhkis : My issue in drupal is, Lets say I selected A and checked the box. Then i select B..the textbox will dissapear and the checkbox will be unticked right? This here no problem. The problem rise when i Select back A, and check the box, the text box doesnt appear. Untill I uncheck and Check back
[01:24:24] <Dreamstiffler> drupal why u kill me
[01:29:52] <Uhkis> Dreamstiffler: are you using jquery_update module?
[01:30:37] <Dreamstiffler> Uhkis: yes 1.7. It doesnt allow me to go higher due to some modules wont work
[01:30:56] <Dreamstiffler> Uhkis: for the theme im using tho
[01:31:13] <Uhkis> just making sure since your fiddle was using 1.7
[01:36:10] <Dreamstiffler> Uhkis: it is sir. My solution now is to try disable the fx done by drupal on the form. and create it myself.
[01:36:53] <MEGAGHZ> Morning
[01:37:10] <Dreamstiffler> btw guys new question, whats the syntax to choose $("[id^=first]") and $("[id$=last]") ...i want to choose everything that has the same start and last class names
[01:37:27] <Uhkis> Dreamstiffler: you're not gonna have fun solving the submit part after you've done that
[01:38:37] <Dreamstiffler> Uhkis: what do you mean sir, Noob here. Cant make what youre saying
[01:39:12] <Dreamstiffler> Uhkis: nonetheless how do i do this
[01:39:56] <Uhkis> Dreamstiffler: if the extra textbox is common for all the choices, how are you going to separate it when submitting the form
[01:40:55] <Dreamstiffler> Uhkis: no theyre not the same sir. thats for ease of sampling
[01:41:17] <Dreamstiffler> so how do i select both wildcard at start and end?
[01:42:20] <Uhkis> $("[id^=first], $("[id$=last]")")
[01:43:02] <Cork> don't use regex matches for ids
[01:43:28] <Dreamstiffler> thanks sir
[01:43:45] <Dreamstiffler> Cork: why not?
[01:44:06] <Cork> cause that is what classes are for
[01:44:28] <Cork> and you aren't using the id as an id, that is an attribute selector and much sloer
[01:44:31] <Cork> *slower
[01:45:11] <Cork> so 1. bad codeing with better options, and 2. slower then the reader might realize
[01:47:12] <Dreamstiffler> Cork:  well that sucks
[01:49:19] <Dreamstiffler> Cork: thats pretty crappy coz i have at 20 checkboxes for 1 dropdown list. And for 7 lists all of them uses the same classname. And I only 1 to select 1 of each checkboxes in each dropdown list. Im gna go nuts by the end of the day. Thanks anyway
[01:49:39] <Dreamstiffler> *need 1
[01:50:30] <Cork> Dreamstiffler: so select them based on the location of the dropdown
[01:50:52] <Dreamstiffler> Cork: like? I dont get you
[01:51:40] <Cork> Dreamstiffler: for example if you have <select></select> <input type="checkbox" class="a"><input type="checkbox" class="a"><input type="checkbox" class="a"> <select>
[01:52:09] <Cork> you could do $(this).nextUntil('select').filter('.a')
[01:52:09] <Dreamstiffler> Cork: ok and?
[01:52:18] <Cork> where this is the first select element
[01:53:52] <Dreamstiffler> Cork: does that mean it will select all checkboxes within that selection only? not the whole page?
[01:54:17] <Cork> Dreamstiffler: it .nextUntil selects all elements until the next select element
[01:54:18] <Dreamstiffler> Cork: or any other selection?
[01:54:28] <Cork> and then the .filter filters out the ones matching the class
[01:54:33] <Dreamstiffler> Cork: ok cool let me try that
[01:54:46] <Cork> Dreamstiffler: but not it only works if all of them are siblings
[01:55:00] <Cork> you would have to change the selector if there is another structure
[01:55:10] <Cork> its still possible, but the structure matters
[01:55:14] <Dreamstiffler> Cork: Ok let me try to see if i understood that right
[01:57:21] <Dreamstiffler> Cork: I dont need all the siblings, i just need the one with -oth- in the name or id. Or the other option is to select the last of the siblings.
[01:58:09] <Cork> Dreamstiffler: didn't you say you had a class?
[01:58:17] <Dreamstiffler> Cork:  but then again ok let me try
[01:58:27] <Cork> Dreamstiffler: you need to use nextUntil and filter
[01:58:36] <Cork> as you can't filter and do the until in the same call
[02:01:36] <Dreamstiffler> Cork: as i mentioned earlier they all use the same class. For checkboxes. Throughout the page/form. The differentiation is on the id. Hence i wanted to select by using regex.
[02:02:47] <Dreamstiffler> Cork:  brb. i just need to see if switching off drupals fx is a good idea
[02:16:53] <Dreamstiffler> Hmmmmmmmmmmm so many obstacles for such simple thing. Maybe i need a different approach. Im reverting back to my original plan. I dont understand why when i untick using script, the textbox doesnt auto dissappear. Anyone can help me on this?
[02:17:01] <Dreamstiffler> In drupal of course
[02:18:44] <badasafish> Hi Folks, I'm rolling out a new jQuery nav for the mobile version of our site but on some pages it will not work.  Working page: http://www.doble.co.uk/home-page-with-mobile-nav.php, broken page: http://www.doble.co.uk/new-honda-motorcycles/super-sports/2015-CBR1000RR-Fireblade-SP-with-mobile-nav.php.  Any ideas on why it's not working?
[02:18:45] <Dreamstiffler> What im trying to say is, if i untick the checkbox using mouse click, the textbox will toggle nicely. appear and dissappear. but when i click it via script thats executed via the drop down, the tick box selects and unselect, but it doesnt have any affect on the textbox.
[02:19:33] <Dreamstiffler> Why do i need to add the action for the textbox. shouldnt it be automated?
[02:30:51] <badasafish> Hi Folks, I'm rolling out a new jQuery nav for the mobile version of our site but on some pages it will not work.

[02:33:45] <t4nk018> Hi
[02:33:57] <Omar-> hi
[02:34:01] <t4nk018> Need technical help on
[02:34:10] <t4nk018> DialogExtend
[02:34:12] <Omar-> ?ask @ t4nk018
[02:34:12] <b-ot> t4nk018: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[02:34:24] <t4nk018> okay
[02:35:00] <t4nk018> I want to code something on the click of minimize widget of the jequery dialog
[02:35:13] <t4nk018> But don't know how to achiev this programatically
[02:35:23] <t4nk018> anyone please
[02:35:56] <Omar-> can you provide a fiddle t4nk018?
[02:36:26] <Omar-> badasafish are you using jQuery-Mobile?
[02:36:48] <badasafish> Omar - Nope
[02:37:20] <t4nk018> May I know how to create that
[02:37:29] <t4nk018> @Omar
[02:37:44] <Uhkis> ?demo @ t4nk018
[02:37:44] <b-ot> t4nk018: Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[02:38:23] <Omar-> badasafish what's not working in the navigation?
[02:39:17] <badasafish> Omar- On the working page the navigation is shown and works fine whilst on the non working page the navigation doesn't appear at all and there is reference to some jQuery errors
[02:39:59] <badasafish> Omar- please note this is the mobile version of the site, so you will need to shrink it down in Chrome for example to see how the menu should be working correctly
[02:41:04] <Omar-> badasafish you mean the panel doesn't appear?
[02:41:51] <badasafish> Omar- nothing to do with the mobile nav appears or works.  There should be a grey bar across the top of the page with the menu icon, which when clicked slides the menu across
[02:42:18] <Omar-> badasafish this is what I meant, there's no panel in the broken page
[02:42:30] <badasafish> Omar- exactly!
[02:43:02] <Omar-> badasafish you have 2 errors
[02:43:41] <Omar->  Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'blocker' of undefined - VM393:20
[02:43:41] <Omar-> jquery-1.7.2.min.js:4 GET http://www.doble.co.uk/%27%27 404 (Not Found)
[02:44:03] <badasafish> Omar- it's the first one that is the issue, but i have no idea what is causing it or what the resolution is
[02:45:01] <Omar-> you're loading <script src="/Scripts/modernizr-2.6.1.min.js"></script> twice
[02:46:36] <Omar-> you're using an old version of jquery <script type="text/javascript" src="http://www.doble-shop.co.uk/shop/js/infortis/jquery/jquery-1.7.2.min.js"></script>
[02:47:15] <badasafish> yes, this is imposed from the magento install that we are running
[02:47:41] <badasafish> the question is why is the mobile nav working on one page but not the other, which should be using all the same jquery files
[02:49:09] <Omar-> badasafish i've checked both pages, the only difference I could spot is that modernizr-2.6.1.min.js is loaded twice in the borken page
[02:49:39] <Omar-> the error is emitted by mmenu js library
[02:55:21] <badasafish> Omar- since the menu works fine on one page I'm sure the mmenu library is fine, I'm just struggling to figure out what is breaking it on the other page
[02:56:13] <Omar-> badasafish i'm going through both pages' source, they are identical unless i'm unable to spot any difference
[03:01:59] <badasafish> Omar- but there must be something different right? or the menu would work OK
[03:03:22] <Omar-> badasafish of course. are you sure you aren't using any exta js code in broken page?
[03:03:43] <Omar-> there are lots of code, it's difficult to spot the differences
[03:07:26] <badasafish> Omar- yeah, I'm looking through and trying to find any relevant discrepancies but struggling
[03:11:20] <Omar-> badasafish mmenu is opting an error, start with mmenu code
[03:11:21] <badasafish> Omar- The broken page had some addthis scripts on, I've removed those for the time being and menu appears at the top now but it doesn't work on click
[03:16:37] <Omar-> badasafish in line 2485 you have code that controlling click any [href]
[03:16:42] <Omar-> of any [href]
[03:16:50] <Omar->  $j('a[href*=#]:not([href=#])').click(function() {
[03:17:03] <Omar-> this maybe causing it
[03:17:20] <Omar-> try :not([href=#mobile_menu])
[03:18:03] <Omar-> the script there is meant to scroll to target div within same page
[03:18:22] <Omar-> you have to exclude href=#mobile_menu
[03:18:55] <badasafish> Omar- Yes that's it!
[03:18:58] <Omar-> badasafish $j('a[href*=#]:not([href=#mobile_menu])').click(function() {
[03:20:04] <morfin> hello did anybody use jqWidgets?
[03:20:40] <badasafish> Omar- Thank you so much for your help Omar, now I just need to figure out how to get the addthis code included without breaking everything else
[03:23:43] <Omar-> badasafish you're welcome :)
[03:25:30] <Erwat> wait in chrome Math.pow(0,0) returns 1?
[03:26:00] <badasafish> Omar- adding async="async" to the calling of the addthis script has got that functioning :)
[03:26:59] <Omar-> badasafish well done :)
[03:27:22] <badasafish> Omar- thanks again, that was very kind of you to take the time to help me
[03:28:02] <Omar-> badasafish it's a pleasure :)
[03:29:06] <Omar-> Erwat https://www.math.hmc.edu/funfacts/ffiles/10005.3-5.shtml
[03:29:57] <Omar-> http://www.math.utah.edu/~pa/math/0to0.html
[03:30:18] <Omar-> chrome is correct ;)
[03:32:03] <Erwat> Omar-: http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=0%5E0 is it?
[03:32:32] <morfin> any number with pow 0 gives 1
[03:34:22] <Erwat> well, power is defined as n^m = n * n * ... * n m times
[03:34:45] <Erwat> 0^0 would be 0 * 0 but exactly 0 times (so nothing is there)
[03:43:15] <slax0r> hi, any way to not include hidden inputs in serialize?
[03:43:38] <slax0r> I don't mean input type hidden, but inputs that are not visible due to parent display setting
[03:49:58] <delboy1978uk> cant get a simple bootstrap popover working on an <a> tag?, what schoolboy error am i making? http://jsbin.com/jeqohawoyi/2/edit?html,js,output
[03:53:12] <delboy1978uk> just noticed jquery line in head twice, removed, but still not happening http://jsbin.com/jeqohawoyi/2/edit?html,js,output
[03:58:45] <Uhkis> hmm, is there any downside of getting data via POST?
[03:59:36] <delboy1978uk> no?
[04:00:54] <bacobart> well i suppose if you want your data to be available to everyone via the browser its easier to use get
[04:02:19] <delboy1978uk> so the upside is post is more secure than get in that vars arent in the url
[04:02:43] <Uhkis> yeah, i'm gonna stick with post
[04:02:45] <delboy1978uk> the downside is post is more secure than get in that vars arent in the url
[04:02:49] <delboy1978uk> lol
[04:02:58] <delboy1978uk> yeah you should
[04:18:37] <_lazarevsky> hello all
[04:18:49] <_lazarevsky> I have an input field to which I apply bootstrap's datepicker
[04:19:12] <_lazarevsky> whenever the input is clicked on I show the datepicker
[04:19:29] <_lazarevsky> however, in some scenarios I don't wanna show the datepicker so I disable the input
[04:19:37] <_lazarevsky> this works super in firefox however in chrome
[04:19:47] <_lazarevsky> even though the input is disabled, the click event is still registered
[04:19:52] <_lazarevsky> any ideas?
[04:20:10] <_lazarevsky> I wouldn't wanna hard code logic in my code to handle this odd behaviour in chrome
[04:20:15] <_lazarevsky> is there another way of doing this?
[04:20:17] <_lazarevsky> thanks so much!
[04:21:09] <mbrzuzy> What do you think about adding logic to your event handler that checks if the input is disable?
[04:22:15] <mbrzuzy> var attr = $(this).attr('disabled'); if (typeof attr !== typeof undefined && attr !== false)
[04:22:25] <Cork> no
[04:22:31] <Cork> mbrzuzy: don't use attr for states
[04:22:36] <Cork> prop('disabled')
[04:22:55] <mbrzuzy> I didn't know that :)
[04:23:03] <Cork> also you don't need the typeof check
[04:23:15] <Cork> just if($(this).prop('disabled')) {}
[04:25:43] <Omar-> _lazarevsky you can add pointer-event: none;
[04:26:06] <Omar-> input[type="text"]:disabled { pointer-events: none; } this will neglect any mouse/touch event

[04:49:19] <lintguy> I'm building a webbapp that has an API for writing files, so i wan't to minify and concatenate JS files in the browser before uploading them to the API as a file. But i can't find any minifier that can do it in JS. Anyone know one?
[04:49:53] <bl4ckdu5t> I am in a node which is now my $(this) . To add a sibling 'div', do I need to go to its parent and append (like I always do) or can I just append it after the present element
[04:51:01] <Cork> bl4ckdu5t: you mean you want to insert something after/before an element?
[04:51:11] <bl4ckdu5t> never mind. I just found http://api.jquery.com/after/
[04:51:39] <bl4ckdu5t> Yes. I used to go back to the parent till now
[04:52:06] <Cork> ya, that is what you do in the native dom
[04:52:15] <Cork> or rather with the dom function
[04:52:17] <Cork> +s
[04:52:49] <bl4ckdu5t> you mean without jquery
[04:52:53] <Cork> ya
[04:53:06] <Cork> .after/.before does this internally
[04:53:22] <bl4ckdu5t> ok great
[05:04:05] <mrbubbles> hi guys, I’m building a plugin which generates an email newsletter from a series of articles. At the moment I’ve got it so that when you drag/drop an article onto a hotspot the javascript inserts a nested table, so the newsletter gradually builds up that way. However, I was thinking that - as the newsletter can be represented by a json object quite easily - then maybe there are libraries out there which a) allow the manipulation of a json object by
[05:04:06] <mrbubbles> drag/drop (to make building the newsletter easier) b) can generate templated code from a json object (to generate the newsletter from the json). I’ve found https://github.com/leonidas/transparency for the latter, but am still not sure about the first bit… can anyone suggest anything?
[05:18:34] <jeffreylevesque> i need to parse content of url - and would like to do it on the client side as much as possible while avoiding the 'cors' problem
[05:18:38] <jeffreylevesque> is it possible
[05:18:46] <jeffreylevesque> or, do i have to do it via serverside?
[05:22:39] <Cork> jeffreylevesque: content of url?
[05:22:44] <Cork> what do you mean by that?
[05:22:50] <jeffreylevesque> external webpage
[05:23:04] <Cork> so you want to fetch a webpage and then grab something from it?
[05:23:43] <jeffreylevesque> yea, fetch the from external webpage, and return it to jquery variable on the clientside
[05:23:55] <Cork> then you hit cors, as this is explicitly what cors is there for
[05:24:29] <Cork> and only three solutions around this is either to 1. config the server to respond with the needed cors headers
[05:24:43] <Cork> 2. give the server a jsonp api so you can fetch it that way
[05:25:01] <Cork> or 3. proxy the request over your server so js doesn't have to do cross domain
[05:25:06] <jeffreylevesque> what if i get the content of an external webpage using nodejs, and return it my clientside jquery?
[05:25:27] <Cork> client side doesn't care how you get it server side
[05:25:55] <Cork> client side blocks this cause else you can fetch page data as the user (thing your perference page in facebook for example)
[05:26:15] <Cork> and do nasty things like grab your real address, change your password or so on
[05:27:11] <jeffreylevesque> how do i make a clientside js make an http request to a serverside js (maybe nodejs)?
[05:27:29] <Cork> jeffreylevesque: client side doesn't care what language the server uses
[05:27:41] <Cork> all it cares about is an url and what type of request is expected
[05:27:53] <Cork> the rest is up to the server
[05:36:44] <jeffreylevesque> Cork, if i define a serverside script (using phantomjs), can i call it from clientside js?
[05:37:22] <jeffreylevesque> using ajax, and set the url to the serverside js?
[05:37:50] <Cork> jeffreylevesque: you would have to have a server proxying the request
[05:38:18] <Cork> you might be able to do it with the built in server for phantomjs
[05:38:28] <Cork> but this is offtopic for this channel
[05:38:41] <jeffreylevesque> do you know where i can get help with that?
[05:38:54] <jeffreylevesque> is phantomjs too heavy for scraping content?
[05:39:23] <Cork> jeffreylevesque: to begin with i don't see why you need phantomjs
[05:39:41] <Cork> all it sounds like you want is to get the html
[05:39:42] <jeffreylevesque> i am trying to avoid php, or python
[05:39:45] <jeffreylevesque> yea
[05:39:57] <Cork> so all you need is a server to fetch that content
[05:40:05] <Cork> you don't need to render it server side
[05:40:23] <jeffreylevesque> what's your suggested approach to fetch content
[05:40:39] <Cork> like i said, depends on what server language you want to use
[05:49:14] <Erwat> load time of 1 minute on mobile
[05:49:30] <Erwat> 3g throttling that is
[05:51:40] <MikeD_> 1 minute?!?
[05:52:46] <baako> hi guys I want to get all the text in a div with class of #opID this is what i have done http://kopy.io/9QWVT but it only alert 1 of them
[05:53:23] <MikeD_> #opID is not a class
[05:53:37] <baako> sorry MikeD_ ID field
[05:53:53] <abailarri> Hello. I have an ajax function to send a file to the server. If I send the file works well, but if I want to pass more data it not works. Anyone can help me please? http://jsfiddle.net/98h7onLt/
[05:53:56] <MikeD_> well # is the css notation for "the ONE with the unique id"
[05:54:34] <baako> MikeD_: i have changed it to .opID now
[05:54:42] <baako> so it aint an id anymore but a class
[05:55:03] <baako> looks like that did the job MikeD_ thanks
[05:58:22] <baako> how do i compare the value from var uniqueID with var id //compare value from var uniqueID with var id
[05:58:49] <Cork> baako: if(uniqueID == id) ?
[05:59:13] <Cork> knowing what the variable names contain would help
[05:59:32] <baako> Cork: Cork it will contain only numbers
[05:59:44] <baako> like 1, 2,3 100, 387, 356
[05:59:47] <Cork> ok then what do you mean compare?
[06:00:39] <baako> Cork: i want to check that the value which is getting retrieve by $.get is not the same as the one that $('.opID').each(function() {
[06:00:41] <baako> found
[06:00:56] <Cork> huh?
[06:01:05] <Cork> baako: create a fiddle with the problem
[06:01:07] <baako> Cork: the logic
[06:01:10] <Cork> your question makes no sense
[06:01:11] <baako> is
[06:01:27] <MikeD_> baako: jsfiddle.net
[06:02:20] <baako> to only display the record which $('.opID').each(function() { http://kopy.io/vIpqQ hasn't found
[06:02:38] <baako> i cant created jsfiddle with $.get
[06:02:52] <baako> unless u have a url which only have json records
[06:03:26] <MikeD_> i don't think the problem is in $.get - i'm not sure your html and jquery are 'right'
[06:04:12] <MikeD_> make a simplified example with 2-3 LI that simulates the html you're working with... and a simplified javascript function to find/process them
[06:04:27] <MikeD_> s/LI/DIV  whatever
[06:05:48] <baako> MikeD_: i dont understand what u mean
[06:10:35] <baako> MikeD_: http://kopy.io/vIpqQ the $.each get data by querying the url. i then store the id in uniqueID
[06:12:03] <baako> now what i want to do is check that the id in var tableid  is not the same as the one which is in var uniqueID
[06:17:21] <baako> http://jsfiddle.net/46Lw54ck/
[06:24:24] <MikeD_> baako: trying to read that to figure out what you are actually trying to do is hurting my brain
[06:27:01] <baako> MikeD_: we take it step by step you know what this is trying to do?http://kopy.io/he9pY
[06:27:22] <baako> MikeD_: sorry for hurting you. not intentional
[06:28:14] <baako> what does it get the data and loop it and display.
[06:29:05] <BillCriswell> lol
[06:29:09] <Cork> baako: you should store the id as a data-id="" instead of an extra element
[06:29:33] <Cork> or simply juse use the button elements value
[06:29:47] <baako> Cork: u r right.
[06:29:48] <Cork> baako: also there is no element "<ad>" so you shoudl fix that
[06:29:50] <baako> will do that
[06:30:22] <BillCriswell> baako: You don't have to do data[index], you can pass a second parameter to $.each's callback.
[06:30:33] <Cork> and guessing i think you want to grab the id on click on the button
[06:30:40] <Cork> and then you just have to do this.value
[06:30:52] <Cork> so i don't see a point to line 23 - 28
[06:30:54] <baako> Cork: No.
[06:30:57] <BillCriswell> $.each(data, function (index, el) { el.value }); instead of data[index].value
[06:31:04] <MikeD_> Cork is obviously further into his coffee infusion today than I am
[06:31:22] <Cork> MikeD_: i don't trink coffee so nope :)
[06:31:34] <BillCriswell> Cork: Glad I'm not the only one!
[06:31:54] <Cork> baako: so what are you trying to do with the id there?
[06:32:24] <Trisox> Cork: !!!!!!!!!
[06:32:26] <Trisox> :D
[06:32:53] <baako> Cork: tht $.get runs every 5 seconds which means that i get duplicate data over and over again.
[06:32:57] <baako> i dont want that
[06:33:07] <Cork> ah
[06:33:24] <baako> so what i think i need to do is compare unique
[06:33:24] <baako> ids when you get the new
[06:33:24] <baako> set of data
[06:33:25] <Cork> baako: simplest solution is to wrap these elements with a <div data-id="">
[06:33:52] <Cork> then you would just have to do $('div[data-id=""]').replaceWith()
[06:33:56] <Cork> if it exist
[06:34:27] <Cork> though that said, you prob want to construct a full html blob and append that in one go instead of prepending in a loop
[06:34:28] <baako> am getting confused too much people havign correcting so i will reply abit slow. sorry about this
[06:34:34] <lintguy> Cork: You who knows all, everything a bit more.. does there exist a way to minify JS in the browser without dependencies?
[06:34:40] <Cork> cause modifying the dom in a loop is EXTREAMLY expensive
[06:35:04] <Cork> lintguy: basically all minification is regex so sure you can
[06:35:15] <Cork> i don't know of a ready written js lib
[06:35:16] <baako> BillCriswell: in response to "$.each(data, function (index, el) { el.value }); instead of data[index].value"
[06:35:21] <Cork> but it should definitely be possible
[06:35:30] <lintguy> Cork: I was afraid you would say that :)
[06:35:43] <baako> so instead of data[index].value i will do el.value?
[06:35:46] <Cork> lintguy: look for a nodejs lib
[06:36:00] <Cork> it should be possible to either use straight off or with fairly slight modifications
[06:36:02] <lintguy> Cork: I found that, uglifyjs
[06:36:19] <BillCriswell> lintguy: Oh you said in the browser lol.
[06:36:32] <lintguy> Cork: I'll try and dissect it and see what it can do without node.js
[06:36:53] <Cork> lintguy: i don't think it depends on node.js for anything more then the module loading
[06:36:56] <lintguy> Cork: Unfortunately i don't know much about node.js so it would be a trial and error thing
[06:37:13] <Cork> lintguy: it is fairly straight forward
[06:37:37] <Cork> baako: data[index].id becomes this.id
[06:37:49] <lintguy> Cork: Great, i'll try, thanks again you are the best!
[06:37:57] <Cork> data[index].table_no becomes this.table_no and so on
[06:38:03] <Cork> lintguy: np
[06:38:51] <lintguy> Cork: While i have you on the thread, where do you stand on using Angularjs to build an app? Should i skip it and use reactjs instead?
[06:39:29] <Cork> lintguy: eh, i'm not a fan of that; but it might just be legacy thinking
[06:39:53] <Cork> i usually don't use a language outside its realm
[06:40:01] <Cork> and js is client side web for me
[06:40:11] <lintguy> Cork: I don't think it's only you http://ihateangular.com/
[06:40:12] <Cork> (and mongodb)
[06:40:13] <baako> Cork: i didnt need to include el.value
[06:40:40] <lintguy> Cork: Maybe you are so oldschool that you prefer writing vanilla JS?
[06:40:49] <Cork> lintguy: yes :)
[06:40:58] <baako> Cork: what did you mean by "simplest solution is to wrap these elements with a <div data-id="">"
[06:41:13] <Cork> baako: the new elements you generate
[06:41:23] <Cork> wrap all of it in a div with the data-id attribute
[06:41:31] <Cork> then you can just replace that div with the new content
[06:41:39] <lintguy> Cork: But doesn't it require you to know all the kinks and whatnots with JS?
[06:41:57] <baako> Cork: i do not get where you are coming from.
[06:41:57] <Cork> lintguy: there isn't THAT many whatnots
[06:42:11] <lintguy> Cork: Hm, perhaps not anymore now that IE is out of the picture...
[06:42:33] <Cork> lintguy: i've been coding js since ~96
[06:42:44] <Cork> so ya, tell me about it :D
[06:42:50] <lintguy> Cork: Hehe
[06:43:13] <lintguy> 96, back at the netscape days?
[06:43:21] <Cork> ya
[06:43:26] <decx> did it say dhtml expert on your businesscard at some point?
[06:43:27] <lintguy> Impressive
[06:43:28] <Cork> i started pre ie4
[06:43:32] <rbw> hello. I have multiple input fields with the same name in a table in a form (dynamically created), which is serialized into json on submit. name attr looks like: "property[][key]", and turns into "property: [{key: value}, {key: value}]". I need to access these elements before serializing. Is there some unique identifier generated in jquery objects?
[06:43:40] <Cork> decx: nope i wasn't old enough for that
[06:43:45] <baako> Cork: please can you explain abit more
[06:44:11] <Cork> baako: uh, wrap the new elements in a div so you have a wrapping element
[06:44:15] <lintguy> Cork: I guess you know more languages than JS then?
[06:44:25] <Cork> when the same set comes again just replace the old div so you don't get duplicates
[06:44:54] <baako> Cork: comfused still i thought i am wrapping it
[06:45:16] <baako> http://kopy.io/K7lqw
[06:45:16] <lintguy> Sorry, I'll stop with the OT babble :)
[06:45:17] <Cork> lintguy: basic, pascal, c++, asm, vb (ug), php, asp, rails, python, golang, lisp, rust
[06:45:22] <Cork> i've skipped a few
[06:45:32] <Cork> i'm far from fluent in many of them now days though
[06:45:53] <MikeD_> asp?
[06:45:58] <Cork> pre .net
[06:46:12] <lintguy> Cork: Hm, i have a bridge between SOAP, REST and XML API's that's written in PHP. I'm thinking of rewriting it in GoLang, would that be a good idea?
[06:46:15] <MikeD_> isn't that just VB with 3 intrinsic objects?
[06:46:18] <Cork> before the x was added to aspx
[06:46:25] <lintguy> Or just a waste of time
[06:46:26] <Cork> its iis scripting
[06:46:37] <Cork> microsofts php equiv
[06:46:51] <lintguy> asp was SLOOOOOW
[06:47:01] <Cork> lintguy: exactly
[06:47:02] <MikeD_> yup, very familiar with that - though I used jscript instead of vbscript
[06:47:12] <lintguy> That's mostly why PHP gained ground and that you didn't have to have a windows license
[06:47:16] <Cork> lintguy: if speed is among the most important, then definitely
[06:47:22] <baako> Cork: please http://kopy.io/JGiba
[06:47:26] <Cork> though note go is hard to host
[06:47:33] <Cork> so you will need a vps or a dedicated machine
[06:47:37] <baako> what do i need to wrap they Cork ?
[06:47:52] <Cork> baako: i've answered that question twice
[06:47:57] <lintguy> Cork: Um, not really, PHP can handle hundreds of threads in a HHVM
[06:48:07] <baako> Cork: but i do not understand it
[06:48:28] <lintguy> Cork: My thought was that Golang would be easier and more reliable, but maybe i'm mistaken
[06:48:30] <Cork> lintguy: can php push ~100 000 records of json generation of data in nano seconds?
[06:48:40] <Cork> i think not :)
[06:48:43] <lintguy> Cork: No, but i don't think i will need that ;)
[06:48:59] <lintguy> I'm trying to balance need with cost
[06:49:03] <Cork> lintguy: that's what i said, if speed is important you should definitely look at go
[06:49:26] <Cork> if portability is more important and the speed isn't that important php is a very good option
[06:49:29] <lintguy> Cork: The only thing that makes me not consider Golang is the lack of SOAP libraries
[06:49:46] <Cork> lintguy: i'm not a fan of soap
[06:49:48] <lintguy> But then SOAP is dying
[06:49:55] <lintguy> Neither am i
[06:49:57] <lintguy> it's terrible
[06:50:05] <Cork> my experience is those api's is almost always broken
[06:50:28] <Cork> i've always had to write error/bug management wrappers around soap anyway
[06:50:35] <lintguy> I have recently written a connection towards MS NAVCloud 2013 and can certainly confirm that
[06:51:25] <Cork> rest apis is nicer
[06:51:35] <lintguy> I spent 2000$ on a team to create a connection and simple soap to json conversion, but after 3 weeks they didn't even manage to create the connection, so i had to write it myself
[06:51:48] <Cork> as the format is very strict of what you are allowed to do, so the implementation becomes quite simple
[06:51:56] <Cork> so they normally have much less bugs
[06:52:06] <lintguy> plus it's a smaller standard
[06:52:13] <lintguy> without MS kinks and magic
[06:52:16] <Cork> kinda what i said ya :)
[06:52:28] <lintguy> indeed :)
[06:52:38] <lintguy> Well, i'll stop OT'ing this channel ;)
[06:54:24] <MikeD_> :)
[06:55:15] <baako> Hi guys. this function http://kopy.io/Kxb5j which runs every 5 seconds. The issue is that it keeps displaying the same data over and over again. What I want to do is check if the data it is retrieving is not already on the page and if it is do not display it.
[06:56:07] <MikeD_> baako: how do you propose to do that?
[06:56:09] <jeroenem> whats the best way to check if an element exists on a page? Using $('element').length == 0; ?
[06:56:25] <baako> MikeD_: no clear that is why i am asking :)
[06:56:32] <lintguy> jeroenem: That's the fastest way i know of at least.
[06:57:01] <lintguy> jeroenem: just keep in mind that it iterates elements backwards, so be specific with that elements you check for, or you will notice performance issues
[06:57:37] <lintguy> jeroenem: If the element has an ID, then use vanilla JS selector instead of jquery for fastest speed
[06:58:29] <jeroenem> lintguy: thanks, i will look into it
[06:58:41] <lintguy> jeroenem: and use === instead of == or =
[06:58:53] <jeroenem> whats the 3x = for?
[07:00:09] <baako> how do you wrap an element in a div?
[07:00:14] <lintguy> jeroenem: the strictest comparison, it's harder to run into type conversion issues
[07:00:18] <lintguy> jeroenem: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Comparison_Operators
[07:00:48] <jeroenem> lintguy:  oh okay, thanks for the heads up!
[07:00:57] <lintguy> jeroenem: Np
[07:03:48] <baako> Cork: is this what you meant?
[07:03:48] <baako> $('#Awaiting').wrapAll('<div data-id="'+ this.id +'">');
[07:03:52] <lintguy> Cork: do you blog about your coding adventures?
[07:05:33] <Cork> lintguy: nope
[07:05:55] <lintguy> Ok
[07:07:30] <baako> Cork: is that what you might please by " wrap these elements with a <div data-id="">"
[07:10:05] <BillCriswell> baako: put what you're working on inside <div data-id="">...</div>
[07:11:55] <lintguy> Cork: I actually found a project that do the minification in the browser :) https://github.com/Skalman/UglifyJS-online
[07:13:43] <R13ose> If I have a link that you click like example.com/#help which makes a div display: block; How do I make this appear div appear if you go to the link and not click anything?
[07:13:51] <BillCriswell> You'd have to run that every time though lintguy.
[07:14:16] <BillCriswell> You'd go to a page like https://skalman.github.io/UglifyJS-online/ and put your code. It would be a nightmare kind of.
[07:14:33] <baako> BillCriswell: when you say "what i am working on" do you mean what is getting diplay on the page or what $.get is retrieved?
[07:14:38] <lintguy> BillCriswell: I'm going to use it programmatically of course, not using their gui ;)
[07:15:08] <Cork> R13ose: check location.hash on page start
[07:15:24] <BillCriswell> baako: The element you're working on.
[07:15:30] <lintguy> BillCriswell: Since i'm building a kitchensink for semantic-ui for configuring and customising less variables, i need it to work without external dependencies. Thus why this minifier is useful.
[07:15:39] <baako> http://jsfiddle.net/9rot3roe/ BillCriswell look at the "Results" thats what var decision = accept + tableNo + denied; from http://kopy.io/Kxb5j displays
[07:17:51] <baako> BillCriswell: i dont really get what you mean "The element you're working on." jquery isnt my strong suit like php so i dont understand some of the terminologies
[07:17:57] <R13ose> Cork: example?
[07:18:09] <BillCriswell> baako: I think I came in late.
[07:18:37] <baako> BillCriswell: you want me to explain what i do trying to do?
[07:18:47] <BillCriswell> baako: I'm not sure it would help.
[07:18:57] <baako> BillCriswell:  this function http://kopy.io/Kxb5j which runs every 5 seconds. The issue is that it keeps displaying the same data over and over again. What I want to do is check if the data it is retrieving is not already on the page and if it is do not display it.
[07:19:35] <baako> BillCriswell: Cork said "wrap these elements with a <div data-id="">" so i did this var check = $('#Awaiting').wrapAll('<div data-id="'+ this.id +'">');
[07:19:48] <ashka> hey, I have this code http://jsfiddle.net/5ucamuu3/ . the first button works fine but obviously when it is clicked, the other button that is created doesn't work. Can I somehow "refresh" the selector so that it selects the generated button as well ?
[07:19:52] <BillCriswell> baako: Does the data have a date associated with it or something? You should only request the new data.
[07:20:29] <baako> BillCriswell: no. in my php page i am only selecting what i need
[07:20:46] <BillCriswell> If you're only selecting what you need how are there duplicates?
[07:21:32] <baako> because the user needs to do something to stop selecting the same records
[07:21:37] <baako> thats what the buttons is for
[07:22:57] <BillCriswell> What uniquely identifies these items?
[07:23:08] <baako> so if it retrieves over 100 records at once before new records get inserted to the database i want to only display what is not already on the page and when the user clicks on yes or no button i have any ajax which updated the records
[07:23:21] <baako> BillCriswell: this.id;
[07:23:31] <baako> is the unique id for each records
[07:23:35] <vulpes-> Goodday, say I have a variable that holds a number that is the number of images i wish to place on the page. Say '4' and that current number is the image src beginning with '1.jpg' I want to place those and end with the total '4.jpg' How'd I got about doing that.
[07:24:17] <BillCriswell> baako: Ok, so create an array called ids, then as you loop through check to see if it's in that array, if it's not, add it and write the output.
[07:27:11] <baako> BillCriswell: so wait i create an array and store this.id and then loop over it? do i need to store this.table_no as well?
[07:27:36] <BillCriswell> baako: However much you need to identify something is unique.
[07:27:39] <baako> why i am asking is because the records retrieved by $.get is in a json format
[07:28:18] <baako> this is an example BillCriswell [{"id":25,"table_no":30},{"id":26,"table_no":100},{"id":28,"table_no":23},{"id":29,"table_no":23}]
[07:29:45] <baako> so why do i need to store it in an array?
[07:29:57] <BillCriswell> To make sure you're not outputting it again.
[07:30:25] <baako> cant i just check this.id?
[07:30:35] <baako> because the id is unique
[07:31:02] <baako> "id":25 is unique
[07:31:08] <BillCriswell> That's exactly what I said
[07:31:19] <BillCriswell> baako: http://jsbin.com/punuxa/1/edit?html,js,output should hopefully help.
[07:31:44] <BillCriswell> Notice how first and second each have id: 10 in there but 10 out gets output once.
[07:31:53] <Trisox> any one a tip how to combine $routeProvider and requirejs loading ?
[07:32:25] <BillCriswell> Trisox: #angular might be a better spot to ask that?
[07:32:34] <baako> BillCriswell: oh i see. just a few minutes let me try it and see
[07:32:56] <Trisox> BillCriswell: sorry i thought i wass in that channel :D
[07:33:10] <BillCriswell> Trisox: Happens all the time haha.
[07:33:16] <Trisox> :D
[07:33:29] <Trisox> i'm in jquery more for fun that asking questions realy
[07:34:35] <BillCriswell> Trisox: I hear ya.
[07:37:58] <phpcoder> hello
[07:38:17] <phpcoder> why this    $("input[type='checkbox'][id^='id']:checked").length    does not work?
[07:38:31] <phpcoder> Uncaught Error: Syntax error, unrecognized expression: input[type='checkbox' id^='id']
[07:39:35] <MikeD_> because you discovered a misfeature of parsing complicated strings?
[07:40:13] <BillCriswell> phpcoder: The code you pasted does not match that error.
[07:41:45] <baako> BillCriswell: so get the json formation and convert it into a jquery array?
[07:42:27] <baako> then create another array which stores new records?
[07:43:20] <BillCriswell> There's no jquery array.
[07:43:57] <BillCriswell> but yeah, just keep a record of ids in an array and check for it in there before you write anything.
[07:46:40] <baako> BillCriswell i dont really get it because when this http://kopy.io/Kxb5j runs i will need to store its in 2 arrays which means they will still be the same
[07:47:14] <baako> should I get the id from the function and then check with the value in var tableid = $('<div class="opID hide table_id"></div>').html(this.id);
[07:47:23] <BillCriswell> baako: You set var ids = []; outside of waiting list.
[07:47:28] <baako> because that div stores the id anyways?
[07:47:36] <BillCriswell> outside of waitingList()
[07:49:05] <baako> okay and then?
[07:49:23] <BillCriswell> You combine what I showed you earlier.
[07:50:36] <baako> BillCriswell: so the ids? should be the list of ids that is already on the page? or the ids in $.each?
[07:51:10] <BillCriswell> The ids that are on the page will be in ids since you need a place to check to see if it exists.
[07:52:28] <baako> BillCriswell: so i needs to get the ids on the page to populate the ids array?
[07:52:40] <BillCriswell> No no no.
[07:53:02] <baako> so how will i get the ids in the <div class="opID hide table_id"></div>
[07:53:12] <phpcoder> BillCriswell, yeah i know my worng
[07:54:08] <BillCriswell> baako: You don't need to.
[07:54:26] <BillCriswell> baako: http://pastie.org/pastes/9847722/text I tried commenting this up. Let me know if it's clear to you, but this code should work as is.
[07:54:29] <Trisox> its almost 1700 so good by and thnx for all the fish!!  ;)
[07:54:51] <BillCriswell> Shit make that === -1, not === 0 in the if I added.
[07:55:12] <BillCriswell> http://pastie.org/pastes/9847725/text there we go, that one.
[07:57:04] <bulldog> Hey guys! I want to create a square div, which holds many images
[07:57:12] <BillCriswell> Shit, missed a closing ). Here you go: http://pastie.org/pastes/9847728/text
[07:57:26] <BillCriswell> bulldog: On a website? You maniac.
[07:57:36] <bulldog> and I want to show only one image, using fadein/fadeout, depending on what other element is hovered
[07:57:52] <BillCriswell> Ah, so usability is the focus.
[07:58:30] <bulldog> i guess, my main concern is that having the image change instantly every time you move the mouse could give someone a seizure
[07:58:47] <BillCriswell> bulldog: Right right.
[07:58:49] <baako> BillCriswell: oh i see now thanks will test it late. My daughter is awake gonna play with here for a bit
[07:59:02] <BillCriswell> Ok baako, enjoy!
[07:59:32] <bulldog> but I can't figure out a way to smoothly fade in things, as the thing I want to fade in/out might change in the middle of the animation
[07:59:41] <BillCriswell> bulldog: So you want some elements outside of this square to show/hide elements in the square.
[07:59:48] <BillCriswell> bulldog: css animations would make that nice.
[08:01:58] <bulldog> BillCriswell: that sounds reasonable, let me try it out. Ive been trying to do it with jquery all along
[08:02:07] <BillCriswell> bulldog: http://jsbin.com/cahuqe/1/edit?html,css,output something like that?
[08:04:21] <bulldog> BillCriswell: that looks good, but sorry, I guess I didnt explain myself. All the images are on top of each other in my case.
[08:04:36] <BillCriswell> Ok
[08:04:54] <BillCriswell> So something outside of them controls their display?
[08:06:40] <yuung> hey, i'm having a very frustrating problem:  i'm trying to upload images using $.ajax and FormData.  however, it seems like the ajax call is parsing FormData and not the files themselves.  code: http://jsfiddle.net/70xL48hL/
[08:06:52] <bulldog> BillCriswell: correct
[08:07:08] <baako> BillCriswell: much love. Thanks for your help and time. Stay bless
[08:07:16] <BillCriswell> baako: No problem.
[08:07:44] <Cork> bulldog: are you sure v is a file object?
[08:08:03] <Cork> also cache: false is pointless for post calls
[08:08:19] <bulldog> Cork: ?
[08:08:32] <Cork> bulldog: cache: false is explicitly for get calls
[08:08:40] <Cork> it appends a _=<timestamp> to the url
[08:08:51] <Cork> the option isn't needed for anything else
[08:09:08] <Cork> as post is never cached you don't need it there
[08:09:18] <bulldog> Cork: that is for yuung :)
[08:09:33] <Cork> anyway the v variable comment is the only thing i can think of
[08:09:49] <Cork> the rest look close enough to what i use
[08:10:00] <yuung> Cork, yes - i'll post the console.log output in a sec
[08:10:14] <Cork> ah, .. sorry for the nic mixup...
[08:10:22] <BillCriswell> bulldog: http://jsbin.com/cahuqe/4/edit?css,js,output I'd do something like this.
[08:10:23] <yuung> np - bulldog ty !
[08:10:44] <Cork> yuung: also note dataType sets the accept http REQUEST header
[08:10:47] <BillCriswell> Might need to switch mouseout with mouseleave...
[08:10:53] <Cork> it doesn't get jquery to handle any response as json
[08:10:53] <BillCriswell> but that shoudl get you close.
[08:11:13] <Cork> yuung: so unless the php scripts sets the response content-type correctly data.error will be problematic
[08:12:28] <yuung> Cork, here's the output for the k, v args: http://jsfiddle.net/70xL48hL/1/
[08:12:42] <bulldog> BillCriswell: this is great!
[08:13:01] <yuung> Cork, I'll look into the response content type
[08:13:07] <BillCriswell> glad it's useful!
[08:13:20] <Cork> yuung: i would guess at k isn't valid
[08:13:39] <yuung> okay, so the response content-type is text/html; charset=utf-8
[08:13:41] <Cork> 0=value doesn't sounds like a good param key
[08:13:50] <bulldog> BillCriswell: I'll try to get it to work on my thing :D
[08:13:53] <Cork> yuung: so php send html not json back
[08:14:03] <BillCriswell> bulldog: Yeah, any issues might need to replace mouseout with mouseleave
[08:14:15] <yuung> Cork, i'm guessing i'll have to go server side to fix that?
[08:14:20] <BillCriswell> I forget the difference between the two currently and too lazy to look it up.
[08:14:26] <Cork> ?g php header
[08:14:28] <b-ot> Cork: PHP: header - Manual → http://php.net/manual/en/function.header.php
[08:14:37] <Cork> you want application/json
[08:14:53] <BillCriswell> I almost just fell over my desk just standing here.
[08:14:59] <BillCriswell> What the hell is wrong with me
[08:15:22] <Cork> BillCriswell: mouseout means leaving the element (to child or parent)
[08:15:41] <BillCriswell> Ahh, got it.
[08:15:46] <Cork> BillCriswell: while mouseleave is leave the element only to parent
[08:15:51] <BillCriswell> So yeah, use mouseleave bulldog.
[08:15:54] <Cork> actually mouseout is the only event that exist
[08:16:02] <BillCriswell> Hm?
[08:16:06] <Cork> mouseleave is a jquery fake event
[08:16:13] <bulldog> BillCriswell: kk :D
[08:16:17] <Cork> where it does the check if the target is a child for you
[08:16:23] <BillCriswell> Oh nice.
[08:16:29] <BillCriswell> Well, my statement stands haha.
[08:16:37] <yuung> Cork, so I set header('Content-Type: application/json'); I still get same error
[08:16:49] <Cork> yuung: what is the exact error?
[08:16:51] <yuung> Cork, when you say 'k' isn't valid, i'm guessing i should use a string?
[08:17:02] <yuung>  Error uploading images: parsererror
[08:17:02] <yuung> create:203 SyntaxError: Unexpected end of input {stack: (...), message: "Unexpected end of input"}
[08:17:03] <Cork> yuung: 'file' + k should work
[08:17:05] <Cork> for example
[08:17:41] <Cork> yuung: is that from the server?
[08:17:49] <Cork> or in js?
[08:18:23] <yuung> Cork, js - it's the error from the $.ajax.  however i changed the key to 'file'+k, and it *looks* like there's some progress;however i still get an error:
[08:18:42] <yuung> Error uploading images: parsererror.  SyntaxError: Unexpected end of input {stack: (...), message: "Unexpected end of input"}
[08:19:00] <Cork> weird
[08:20:15] <Cork> ya, the rest matches what i do, though i use straight <input type="file"> for the files
[08:20:22] <Cork> but it should be the same thing
[08:20:33] <Cork> can't say why it doesn't work for you
[08:22:19] <yuung> Cork, i''m going to try a plugin based on the same code, thanks though
[08:23:30] <Cork> yuung: http://pastebin.com/nXx0yqCB
[08:23:39] <Cork> that is a straight copy of what i do
[08:24:02] <Cork> the self.data('file') is just taken from an input.files[0] on change
[08:24:09] <Cork> so very close to what you do
[08:25:14] <yuung> Cork weird
[08:25:29] <yuung> Cork *shrug*, hopefully this plugin will work
[08:26:59] <tw2113> anyone know of a QA'd function or snippet that would recreate MD5 style consistent uniqueness in js/jquery?
[08:27:43] <Cork> uh, is that a round about way to ask for a hashing function written in js?
[08:27:54] <tw2113> no purposely
[08:28:06] <tw2113> i just need something that'd be consistent based on string passed in
[08:28:34] <tw2113> it's not security dependent, though knowing it's trustworthy is a plus
[08:28:49] <baako> BillCriswell: i added  decision.slideDown(); before ids.push(id);
[08:28:53] <tw2113> will be used to create unique values for some tracking IDs
[08:29:06] <Cork> so yes then :)
[08:29:08] <baako> but it loops over the same records
[08:29:18] <Cork> most hashes isn't secure hashes
[08:29:21] <smurf_> http://dev.actec.de/index.php?article_id=55&deeplink=57 why does this deeklink work on windows and not on osx? wtf
[08:29:53] <Cork> smurf_: define "work"
[08:30:33] <smurf_> hm lemme check
[08:31:47] <smurf_> Cork: it should pop up a fancybox
[08:32:16] <Cork> and by osx you mean safari?
[08:32:21] <Cork> or any browser on osx?
[08:32:24] <BillCriswell> baako: It doesn't loop over the same one. It would be impossible.
[08:32:26] <smurf_> no all browsers on ox
[08:32:27] <smurf_> osx
[08:32:31] <smurf_> safari and ff
[08:32:47] <Cork> O_o'
[08:32:49] <smurf_> weird
[08:32:52] <smurf_> i know
[08:32:59] <Cork> i would look for a useragent sniffer somewhere
[08:33:12] <BillCriswell> Well, it doesn't add the same one, that would be impossible since we're checking for  it in the ids array.
[08:33:53] <smurf_> Cork: ok crzy i am sittin on this system by macincloud.com
[08:33:56] <baako> BillCriswell: kinda had the feeling
[08:34:29] <smurf_> Cork: maybe they do some weird stuff with the clients
[08:34:45] <smurf_> Cork: do you own a osx ?
[08:35:24] <tw2113> anyways, know of any offhand Cork ? or should I keep searching around on my own?
[08:39:06] <ziyadb> Gentlemen, quick easy question.
[08:39:46] <ziyadb> http://jsfiddle.net/6wYzw/822/ <- the second pair of checkboxes "University" and "Countryside" isn't working http://jsfiddle.net/6wYzw/822/
[08:42:05] <ziyadb> Cleaned it up: http://jsfiddle.net/6wYzw/824/
[08:48:06] <bulldog> BillCriswell: Hey. Would you mind looking at my exact code? I can't get it to work :/
[08:48:49] <BillCriswell> bulldog: Should be able to.
[08:51:17] <ziyadb> BillCriswell: and mine too! :( http://jsfiddle.net/6wYzw/824/
[08:52:25] <rochadt> quit
[08:53:00] <BillCriswell> ziyadb: What's your goal?
[08:53:44] <ziyadb> BillCriswell: I want the Kaplan Room to get hidden if any of the lower 2 checkboxes are checked.
[08:54:15] <yuung> Cork, finally, it works, and strangely enough i used raw XmlHttpRequest.  thanks again for your help though
[08:54:15] <ziyadb> The first two checkboxes already work (they hide Kaplan bath) and only display Kaplan Room if any (or both) of them are checked.
[08:54:25] <ziyadb> I'm just wondering why the lower two don't.
[08:55:06] <lstude> Morning all. I'm trying to clone an email form and having a hard time figuring out how to grab a token I need for the form to work properly. Tried to lay it out in a fiddle here: http://jsfiddle.net/21gr9ukL/2/
[08:55:44] <BillCriswell> ziyadb: So you have three tags selected, do you want them to show any of the things with at least one of those tags or things with all checked tags?
[08:56:03] <ziyadb> BillCriswell: things with all checked tags.
[08:56:15] <robertmaxrees> lstude you want .prop() when working with forms, instead of .attr().
[08:57:08] <lstude> robertmaxrees ok. why is that?
[08:57:14] <robertmaxrees> lstude when you say "clone", do you mean you want to copy the input of a form value, btw?
[08:57:46] <lstude> robertmaxrees sorry, no. i mean clone an existing email form on the page so i can insert another one elsewhere
[08:58:31] <robertmaxrees> lstude .clone() takes up to two optional args - withDataAndEvents and deepWithDataAndEvents
[08:58:35] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/clone/
[08:58:59] <BillCriswell> ziyadb: You should not be using the same id more than once.
[08:59:03] <robertmaxrees> and this shows why you generally want .prop() instead of .attr(), especially with forms -> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/1ckeh195/
[08:59:52] <lstude> robertmaxrees basically i need to somehow get line 5 (clone it from the existing footerBox on the page) and append it to the $insertedHtml I'm building
[09:00:01] <BillCriswell> ziyadb: Also, you're using a regex where an array would be much easier to manage.
[09:00:23] <lstude> oh i see RE: prop
[09:00:52] <ziyadb> BillCriswell: fancy, changing the id to class worked.
[09:00:52] <robertmaxrees> okay - which part are you stuck on, then?  you mentioned a particular token, but it sounds like you're having a harder time simply cloning things.
[09:01:22] <BillCriswell> ziyadb: I'd recommend using an array instead of a regex as well.
[09:02:53] <ziyadb> BillCriswell: noted, sir.
[09:02:54] <ziyadb> Thank you.
[09:03:10] <lstude> robertmaxrees i'm stuck on how to clone the token + take that cloned token and append to my new form
[09:03:17] <BillCriswell> ziyadb: No problem.
[09:04:43] <robertmaxrees> lstude aaaah - you don't want to clone anything :) you want to do something like $('.signup [name="crvs"]').val()
[09:04:46] <lstude> robertmaxrees i originally tried .clone('input[name="crvs"], input[value="tokenValue]')); on line 31 but apparently that isn't a workable solution
[09:04:47] <robertmaxrees> that'll grab the value for you.
[09:05:20] <lstude> robertmaxrees got it. then i can just append that to my $insertedHtml somewhere?
[09:05:54] <robertmaxrees> lstude yep.  otherwise you need to do something like  $('.signup [name="crvs"]').clone(true);
[09:06:01] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/clone/ explains the syntax pretty well.
[09:06:54] <yuung> is there a way i can set an event handler on DOM elements that may not exist at the time of binding, but will exist later?
[09:07:15] <robertmaxrees> yuung sort of - use the delegated syntax of .on()
[09:07:45] <robertmaxrees> yuung this explains why -> http://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events
[09:08:06] <yuung> robertmaxrees, thanks, i'll look into it
[09:08:24] <yuung> may i ask why you say 'sort of'?
[09:08:38] <robertmaxrees> because you aren't binding to the elements directly in that case.
[09:09:06] <robertmaxrees> you're creating an event handler that listens for events that bubble up from children that match a given selector.
[09:09:40] <yuung> ah, i see
[09:09:44] <yuung> mkay, ty!
[09:10:01] <lstude> robertmaxrees think i got it, though there may be a way to dry it up further but lines 18 and 23 are added based on your feedback: http://jsfiddle.net/21gr9ukL/3/
[09:11:43] <morfin> $("element").on("click","tr",function(event){...});
[09:12:15] <robertmaxrees> lstude i'm confused about the lines.
[09:12:21] <robertmaxrees> which ones are you talking about?
[09:12:23] <morfin> i remember that if i add new tr elements it still works)
[09:12:32] <robertmaxrees> ah i see it now, lstude.
[09:12:40] <robertmaxrees> lstude that should work.
[09:12:56] <robertmaxrees> morfin yeah, if you set that on a table or other ancestor.
[09:12:56] <yuung> so if i wanted to use on()'s delegate syntax, would i use something like: $('input[type=file]').on('change', 'input[type=file]', function(event){})?
[09:13:08] <robertmaxrees> yuung no.
[09:13:21] <robertmaxrees> the first object needs to be an ancestor that exists at the time of binding.
[09:13:35] <robertmaxrees> generally that's the element you're appending things to.
[09:13:36] <yuung> ahh
[09:13:45] <yuung> okay, i see
[09:14:00] <robertmaxrees> the docs explain it in good detail :)
[09:14:06] <yuung> so the first input[type=file] could be replaced with say, $('form').  gotcha
[09:14:11] <robertmaxrees> sure
[09:14:15] <robertmaxrees> if the form exists on pageload.
[09:14:22] <yuung> robertmaxrees, yeah - was just a bit confused.  thanks again!
[09:14:24] <morfin> and also no excessive binding required
[09:15:18] <morfin> how do you think what's better: filter out tr's using selector or using callback?
[09:15:25] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[09:15:29] <robertmaxrees> what do you mean?
[09:15:39] <morfin> as example i want some tr's to be non-clickable
[09:16:13] <robertmaxrees> bind a delegated listener that checks to see if the element that the event originated from matches certain criteria.
[09:16:39] <morfin> so you suggest check in listener
[09:16:43] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[09:32:06] <OwlFace> can someone help me with this function?  what am i doing wrong
[09:32:09] <OwlFace> http://pastebin.com/26Ndum8W
[09:32:42] <OwlFace> the second function is incorrect it does not show the correct data
[09:32:56] <robertmaxrees> wihtout seeing an example, it's almost impossible for us to know.
[09:33:33] <OwlFace> a more detailed example?
[09:33:59] <robertmaxrees> a functioning jsfiddle, for instance.  the ajax part apparently works, so you could abstract that part out.
[09:34:51] <OwlFace> oh okay, i was thinking my error was a basic syntax good up or something that could be caught from the example i posted
[09:34:57] <OwlFace> goof up*
[09:35:23] <robertmaxrees> i assume your actual code closes that function, right?
[09:35:51] <OwlFace> im not sure
[09:35:54] <OwlFace> you mean with a bracket?
[09:35:57] <Blinky_> Hi all, could someone have a look at this and tell me why it is not running the function to reload the page.  I am getting a success return from the AJAX. - http://pastie.org/9847917
[09:36:11] <robertmaxrees> OwlFace yes - http://fixee.org/paste/8dw7unj/ like this.
[09:37:04] <robertmaxrees> Blinky_ so you're getting the console log?
[09:37:08] <OwlFace> no because when i do that nothing loads at all
[09:37:13] <OwlFace> when i add that bracket
[09:37:31] <robertmaxrees> OwlFace then something else is broken, because what you shared was invalid code.
[09:37:36] <OwlFace> none of the images load on screen
[09:37:52] <Blinky_> no the console log doesnt show, but the network section of the browser diag is showing a return with the data in an array and success after it.
[09:37:53] <OwlFace> the first function loads the correct data
[09:38:01] <robertmaxrees> OwlFace fiddle it, then.
[09:38:16] <OwlFace> so i assumed by looking at the two functions side by side, it could be determined what is wrong with the second function
[09:38:18] <OwlFace> okay
[09:38:20] <Blinky_> I have also check using - http://nightline.co.uk/php/procedures.php?branch=DF_Manchester - and it is showing success
[09:38:46] <robertmaxrees> Blinky_ put a console.log before that if statement and see if that runs.
[09:39:01] <robertmaxrees> if not, ditch the dataType option.
[09:39:29] <Blinky_> robertmaxrees: no nothing in the console
[09:39:43] <robertmaxrees> Blinky_ yeah, remove the dataType: 'json',  line
[09:41:09] <Blinky_> robertmaxrees: still not working but I now have - Uncaught ReferenceError: success is not defined
[09:42:11] <checkit> Hey guys... I'm wondering what the selector would look like when accessing a field by name and the fields names follow a specific naming convention: <input name="Primary[HomePhone]" />
[09:42:20] <Blinky_> robertmaxrees: My bad, console.log the wrong thing
[09:42:35] <checkit> I tried $('input[Primary[HomePhone]]) but that obviously didn't work.
[09:42:39] <checkit> My fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/d726dfy5/
[09:42:49] <robertmaxrees> checkit you need to escape the [] in that value.
[09:42:59] <Blinky_> robertmaxrees: I have the console.log(data) showing the data being pulled from the database base but still not reloading
[09:43:07] <robertmaxrees> [name="Primary\\[HomePhone\\] iirc
[09:43:23] <robertmaxrees> Blinky_ share an updated paste.
[09:44:18] <checkit> robertmaxrees: I figured that would be the case... What is the escape character?
[09:44:26] <robertmaxrees> checkit i just showed you >.>
[09:44:27] <robertmaxrees> \\
[09:44:50] <checkit> Oh. Missed that. Thank you.
[09:45:21] <Blinky_> robertmaxrees: http://pastie.org/9847939
[09:46:50] <checkit> robertmaxrees: Do I escape the <inpu or the jQuery selector?
[09:47:24] <Blinky_> robertmaxrees: Right I am now getting just the success in the console log.  I believe the rest was a var_dump.  However, it still will not reload the page.
[09:48:27] <robertmaxrees> Blinky_ i assume your most recent paste shows the data that gets dumped to the JS console aqt the bottom?
[09:48:55] <Blinky_> yeah just remove all the array information. I only get the success now
[09:48:59] <robertmaxrees> checkit you escape the [ and ] inside the thinger.
[09:49:06] <paulvd> hello, i am trying to get an accordion to work inside isotope filter, its working fine, however the isotope is resizing in the opposite direction when i click on the isotope http://tinyurl.com/nfn8met ?
[09:49:08] <robertmaxrees> Blinky_ something isn't adding up here.
[09:49:39] <aarobc> How do you debug things bound with $(document).on()? An event is firing somewhere where it shouldn't be, and I can't track down what it is
[09:49:48] <Blinky_> robertmaxrees: I have had the script running before but this one is just not playing nice
[09:50:04] <robertmaxrees> the only reason the reload wouldn't happen here is because your returned data isn't 'success'
[09:50:15] <checkit> robertmaxrees: Right but I'm escaping that in the <input field or on the jQuery selector?
[09:50:24] <robertmaxrees> checkit in the selector.
[09:51:17] <robertmaxrees> if you can change the input, i'd go ahead and change that instead so you don't need to go through this rigamorale in the first place :)
[09:52:23] <checkit> robertmaxrees: There are TONS. Otherwise I'd switch to ID's... I'm trying to escape but I must not be doing it correctly: http://jsfiddle.net/d726dfy5/1/
[09:52:50] <robertmaxrees>  [name="Primary\\[HomePhone\\]
[09:53:31] <checkit> So I need to escape the <input field name? <input name="Primary\\[HomePhone\\]" />
[09:53:38] <robertmaxrees> no.
[09:53:54] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/d726dfy5/2/
[09:53:56] <robertmaxrees> like this.
[09:54:18] <checkit> robertmaxrees: OH!
[09:57:19] <checkit> robertmaxrees: That doesn't seem to be working either...
[09:57:29] <robertmaxrees> i know ;)
[09:57:42] <robertmaxrees> look at your name attribute values in the JS.
[09:58:07] <robertmaxrees> i assume you didn't mean name="Primary[HomePage]"
[09:58:42] <Rubin> how might I get, for example, the 4th <tr> of a table? is there a jquery shortcut for such things?
[09:58:48] <robertmaxrees> .eq()
[09:58:55] <robertmaxrees> $('table tr').eq(3)
[09:59:17] <Rubin> thanks
[10:01:18] <baako> hi guys i have a blinking function http://jsfiddle.net/8cbwe1hs/6/
[10:01:32] <baako> but the issue with it is that after a while it starts lagging
[10:01:46] <baako> then continues to blink. why is that?
[10:03:39] <robertmaxrees> what gives with the init and then the setinterval after?
[10:04:08] <robertmaxrees> just run  var blinking =  $('.spaceMe').blink();
[10:04:25] <robertmaxrees> or, even better, just $('.spaceMe').blink(); if you're not using that return anywher.e
[10:07:01] <Blinky_> robertmaxrees: Any other ideas mate?
[10:08:29] <robertmaxrees> Blinky_ console log out the returned data outsode of the if statement.
[10:08:36] <robertmaxrees> share that in a paste.
[10:08:58] <Blinky_> robertmaxrees: The only console output is the word success
[10:09:17] <robertmaxrees> if the console log inside the conditional doesn't fire, that's your only issue.
[10:09:37] <robertmaxrees> unless there's something else funky going on.
[10:10:27] <baako> robertmaxrees: the issue with that is the results in that fiddle is generate every 5 secons
[10:10:29] <baako> seconds
[10:10:37] <baako> so if i do $('.spaceMe').blink(); before it is generated
[10:10:47] <baako> it wouldnt blink after it has been generated
[10:11:01] <robertmaxrees> baako lol okay, then what's your new issue?
[10:12:43] <baako> robertmaxrees: see on the "results" in the fiddle. http://kopy.io/9hiQ6 generated it
[10:13:08] <baako> the function that generate it fires every 5 seconds setInterval(waitingList, 5000);
[10:13:15] <baako> and what i wanna do is blink it
[10:13:24] <robertmaxrees> you need to reconsider what you've built, then.
[10:13:34] <robertmaxrees> becuase that setInterval is waiting 5 seconds before firing the function.
[10:13:39] <robertmaxrees> and you're wrestling timers.
[10:14:24] <baako> robertmaxrees: yes it does wait and it keeps fireing every 5 seconds and getting new results
[10:14:35] <baako> if php has retrieve them
[10:14:47] <robertmaxrees> you shouldn't need to re-init anything.
[10:15:14] <robertmaxrees> feed a parent selector that looks for all child .spaceMe's and go from there.
[10:16:07] <baako> robertmaxrees: thanks just gonna forget about it
[10:16:13] <robertmaxrees> kay
[10:16:21] <baako> jquery just do my head in alot of the times
[10:16:31] <robertmaxrees> this is more of a raw js issue
[10:17:39] <baako> am sure it can be done.
[10:18:15] <baako> thinks i like "feed parent selector" and all child dont make much sense to me.
[10:18:28] <robertmaxrees> well, why are you trying to re-init?
[10:19:27] <baako> robertmaxrees: am just trying keep blinking a class until the new action is done
[10:19:39] <robertmaxrees> and then what?
[10:21:13] <baako> keep listening for more of .spaceME
[10:21:40] <robertmaxrees> right - so set up your plugin so it runs a .find() for the elements you care about.
[10:22:08] <robertmaxrees> so something like $('.someParentDiv').blinky({child: '.spaceMe'});
[10:22:20] <robertmaxrees> then run a .find() off of the parent element to find all of those children.
[10:23:18] <arup_r> Can we make select list values as an anchor link?
[10:23:35] <robertmaxrees> arup_r come again?
[10:23:39] <arup_r> I tried but -- https://gist.github.com/aruprakshit/c3f4e74e144abd87b77b
[10:23:47] <arup_r> Yes sure
[10:24:18] <arup_r> values of a dropdown list I am looking if I can make as link
[10:24:25] <robertmaxrees> ah - data: { surname : $( this ).val() }, isn't what you think it is.
[10:24:27] <arup_r> But mine is not working..
[10:24:51] <arup_r> No.. you didn't get me it seems :)
[10:25:07] <arup_r> With Ajax I am adding one select list dynamically
[10:25:11] <robertmaxrees> http://fixee.org/paste/ggvu92q/
[10:26:22] <arup_r> and I am trying to make the dropdown values as anchored..  but values are coming.. but they are not links.. only plain text values
[10:26:42] <robertmaxrees> right.
[10:26:45] <robertmaxrees> that's not valid html.
[10:26:48] <baako> robertmaxrees: like  http://kopy.io/ko2Sn
[10:27:07] <arup_r> why?
[10:27:13] <arup_r> I am not getting you
[10:27:19] <robertmaxrees> arup_r because you can't have anything more than text as a child of an option.
[10:27:31] <robertmaxrees> baako no - your plugin code would need to be updated.
[10:28:12] <arup_r> Oh..
[10:28:16] <arup_r> Is it?
[10:28:34] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/option
[10:28:42] <robertmaxrees> see the "permitted content" section?
[10:29:04] <arup_r> lemme read
[10:29:21] <arup_r> I am new to frontend.. My hard time started :(
[10:29:33] <baako> robertmaxrees: the links is for me?
[10:29:40] <robertmaxrees> no, that was for arup_r
[10:36:00] <Rubin> if i have a dom element in a var, how can i match its sub-elements (similar to $() for the document, but just on the children)
[10:36:08] <Rubin> is there a foo.jQuery() or something?
[10:36:09] <robertmaxrees> .find()
[10:36:11] <Rubin> ahh
[10:36:13] <Rubin> tx
[10:36:51] <arup_r1> Can https://gist.github.com/aruprakshit/c3f4e74e144abd87b77b this be written in well manner..? I took help of too many variable it seems :p
[10:37:05] <robertmaxrees> arup_r1 i showed you your first problem.
[10:37:18] <arup_r1> I removed..
[10:37:26] <arup_r1> Now it is an updated Gist
[10:37:31] <robertmaxrees> it wasn't a removal - $(this) isn't what you think it is.
[10:37:36] <robertmaxrees> take a look at the fixee i sent.
[10:38:16] <arup_r1> ok
[10:38:27] <arup_r1> but it is working..:( Let me check your link
[10:38:58] <robertmaxrees> the ajax request is running?
[10:39:42] <arup_r1> Yes,,,
[10:39:52] <robertmaxrees> weird.  surprising.
[10:40:12] <arup_r1> I only had a problem with anchor.. But that is cleared now from your Mozilla link
[10:40:28] <robertmaxrees> so you just want cleanup advice to make the code clearer?
[10:40:33] <arup_r1> Yes.. $(this) worked there.. But not inside .done() hook
[10:40:45] <arup_r1> I used $(this) inside the.done()
[10:41:06] <robertmaxrees> right, because your 'this' object would be a different object.
[10:41:08] <arup_r1> it didn't work.. so.. I took basic school technique
[10:41:27] <arup_r1> Yes
[10:41:36] <arup_r1> refactoring if possible..
[10:42:03] <baako> http://kopy.io/QM1tU
[10:42:09] <baako> robertmaxrees: http://kopy.io/QM1tU
[10:42:16] <arup_r1> Because I write it to meet my need.. and it meets what I wanted... but code looks ugly
[10:42:20] <robertmaxrees> baako no.
[10:42:31] <robertmaxrees> you'll need to edit the widget code itself.
[10:43:16] <robertmaxrees> arup lemme show you a few things.
[10:43:45] <arup_r1> one moment
[10:43:48] <arup_r1> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2000656/using-href-links-inside-option-tag
[10:43:52] <baako> robertmaxrees: yes you said that but where should add this? before serInterval(function() {
[10:44:02] <arup_r1> robertmaxrees: What I was trying to get..
[10:44:02] <robertmaxrees> arup_r1 don't use it that way.
[10:44:08] <arup_r1> ok :(
[10:44:12] <arup_r1> Why ?
[10:44:14] <robertmaxrees> baako inside the widget code.  not sure what you're not understanding about that.
[10:44:25] <robertmaxrees> arup_r1 inline event handlers are bad.  let me fix up what you have now first.
[10:44:31] <arup_r1> sure
[10:44:40] <arup_r1> please fix in the Gist itself
[10:44:45] <robertmaxrees> uh, why?
[10:44:45] <arup_r1> robertmaxrees: ^^
[10:44:57] <arup_r1> because Gist are trustworthy :p
[10:45:04] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[10:45:07] <robertmaxrees> so are fixees
[10:45:07] <arup_r1> lol

[10:49:09] <robertmaxrees> baako this isn't what i meant at all.
[10:49:39] <robertmaxrees> baako do you have much experience with jquery and plugins?
[10:50:01] <baako> robertmaxrees: nope
[10:50:08] <arup_r1>  $namesDiv is global variable?
[10:50:28] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[10:50:30] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[10:50:33] <robertmaxrees> that's scoped to that function.
[10:50:34] <baako> am php, python, java debeloper when i use jquery its just for basic things
[10:50:40] <robertmaxrees> *javascript.
[10:50:44] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[10:50:48] <arup_r1> any link I want to read it...
[10:51:00] <arup_r1> In Ruby, it is called global var :p
[10:51:15] <robertmaxrees> arup_r1 in javascript, prepending with the var keyword scopes it to the function.
[10:51:25] <robertmaxrees> without that, it's "global" and technically invalid.
[10:52:06] <baako> robertmaxrees: just explains to me what i need to do please and i will follow it
[10:52:14] <robertmaxrees> i did.
[10:52:25] <robertmaxrees> e var keyword scopes it to the function.
[10:52:25] <robertmaxrees> [2015:01:21:10:51:25] <robertmaxrees> without that, it's "global" and technically
[10:52:26] <robertmaxrees> woops.

[10:52:32] <robertmaxrees> really trivial stuff.
[10:55:07] <baako> robertmaxrees: you said "so something like $('.someParentDiv').blinky({child: '.spaceMe'}); then run a .find() off of the parent element to find all of those children"
[10:55:15] <robertmaxrees> baako yep.
[10:55:17] <baako> am doing that
[10:55:20] <robertmaxrees> nope.

[10:56:04] <robertmaxrees> arup_r1 which "$ stuff"?
[10:56:09] <arup_r1> I don't know the term so I'm not able to google it :)
[10:56:17] <robertmaxrees> which part?
[10:56:25] <night-ow_> If I'm using the jquery-validate plugin, how do i disable dynamic error messages?

[10:56:58] <arup_r1> it seems
[10:57:30] <arup_r1> you miised one var it seems
[10:57:42] <arup_r1> $selectList = $('<select id="select-list1">');
[10:57:48] <robertmaxrees> see the comma before it?
[10:58:09] <robertmaxrees> you can declare multiple vars in one statement in js by doing var foo = 'something, bar = 'something else';
[10:58:21] <robertmaxrees> *foo = 'something', bar = 'something else';
[10:58:41] <arup_r1> ok
[10:58:47] <arup_r1> but code is not working
[10:58:55] <robertmaxrees> share an exmaple of the data from the server then
[11:00:48] <arup_r1> updated https://gist.github.com/aruprakshit/c3f4e74e144abd87b77b
[11:01:03] <robertmaxrees> from the browser please.
[11:01:05] <robertmaxrees> not rails.
[11:01:41] <baako> robertmaxrees: so i needed to do return this.find(options.child).each(function() {
[11:01:59] <robertmaxrees> baako that's one way, yeah, though that'll break if you don't supply that option.
[11:02:27] <arup_r1> how from browser?
[11:02:29] <robertmaxrees> arup_r1 if you put console.log(JSON.stringify(data)); as the first thing in that .done() callback, it'll print out what we need.
[11:02:37] <robertmaxrees> then just open your console and copy it.
[11:02:41] <arup_r1> ok
[11:02:42] <arup_r1> got it
[11:04:47] <samssh> So does jQuery lint inline <script> code in files that are $(...).load()ed? I found the script would not even start to run if a line is invalid.
[11:04:53] <arup_r1> https://gist.github.com/aruprakshit/c3f4e74e144abd87b77b
[11:05:25] <robertmaxrees> samssh http://api.jquery.com/load/#script-execution
[11:07:13] <arup_r1> I gave, robertmaxrees:
[11:07:20] <robertmaxrees> araujo i see it.  one sec yo.
[11:07:22] <robertmaxrees> at work ;)
[11:07:27] <samssh> That just tell me that it won't load scripts if you use a selector with .load()
[11:07:34] <baako> still dont work :{
[11:07:44] <robertmaxrees> baako my example did work.  dunno what yo tell you.
[11:08:44] <robertmaxrees> arup_r1 http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/3sjo0ypt/ works fine.
[11:08:54] <robertmaxrees> has to add the final append to the document, but it works otherwise.
[11:09:05] <baako> robertmaxrees: your example works great but remember what i said before .spaceME is not in the page. It is only they when http://kopy.io/pOcaJ is ran
[11:09:13] <baako>  setInterval(waitingList, 5000);
[11:09:29] <robertmaxrees> baako the entire point of the change i made is so you don't need to re-run that init.
[11:09:46] <robertmaxrees> you select the parent that you're appending to and find them all instead, thereby not needing to initialize again.
[11:09:57] <robertmaxrees> that way it doesn't matter when they were added.
[11:10:19] <robertmaxrees> samssh it doens't lint them, but it treats them like any other js.  bad code will break things.
[11:10:36] <samssh> hmmm
[11:11:45] <baako> robertmaxrees: okay i got an error blinking =  $('#Awaiting').blink({child: '.spaceMe'}); // default is 500ms blink interval.
[11:11:56] <baako> uncaught TypeError
[11:12:08] <baako> undefined is not a function
[11:12:17] <baako> should the blinking be in variable?
[11:12:22] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[11:12:30] <robertmaxrees> you need to define the widget before you can use it.
[11:12:49] <BillCriswell> baako: Are you just trying to make an element blink?
[11:13:17] <robertmaxrees> BillCriswell this is what we have now: http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/8cbwe1hs/9/
[11:13:17] <baako> hi BillCriswell yes
[11:13:41] <robertmaxrees> though actually that should be ng timeout: 272 seconds)
[11:13:41] <robertmaxrees> [2015:01:21:11:12:08] <baako> undefined is not a function
[11:13:47] <robertmaxrees> wtf -> http://jsfiddle.net/8cbwe1hs/10/ this
[11:13:50] <baako> BillCriswell: remember that html get generated when that awaitingList function get trigger
[11:14:07] <BillCriswell> Are css animations out of the question?
[11:14:21] <robertmaxrees> i didn't even thing about css animations.
[11:14:22] <baako> robertmaxrees: what you mean wtf?
[11:14:24] <robertmaxrees> *think
[11:14:24] <arup_r1> I addded       $("#client_surname").append($namesDiv) ... not working yet
[11:14:28] <robertmaxrees> baako my bad paste.
[11:14:29] <BillCriswell> robertmaxrees: lol
[11:14:44] <robertmaxrees> arup_r1 the code works.  "not working" is rarely, if ever, helpful.
[11:14:58] <arup_r1> dropdown is not coming
[11:14:59] <t4nk530> Hello there - ive got a small question regarding AJAX POST/Request. When it's triggered it makes the page lagg for a lil while till it's finished. How to make it that it wont lagg at all and just work in the "background"?
[11:15:05] <arup_r1> but data I can see in the console
[11:15:30] <BillCriswell> baako: http://jsbin.com/qewil/1/edit?html,css,output ?
[11:15:32] <robertmaxrees> arup_r1 then you're doing something wrong...
[11:15:42] <robertmaxrees> arup_r1 the example works.  make sure your selectors are good.
[11:15:43] <robertmaxrees> etc
[11:16:33] <arup_r1> No.. see the updated code - https://gist.github.com/aruprakshit/c3f4e74e144abd87b77b
[11:16:38] <t4nk530> Anyone know how to run AJAX request purely on background without any "lagg" when the function is trigged?
[11:16:39] <arup_r1> comment sectiob
[11:17:05] <robertmaxrees> t4nk530 it should be default.  are you setting async: false or doing something else intensive?
[11:17:26] <baako> BillCriswell: thanks
[11:17:34] <baako> robertmaxrees: thank you too stay bless
[11:18:14] <robertmaxrees> arup_r1 that should function just fine.   is the $('#client_surname') an element on the page?
[11:18:22] <robertmaxrees> oh, that's why.
[11:18:23] <t4nk530> robertmaxrees: I have async: false tbh, is that bad ?
[11:18:27] <robertmaxrees> t4nk530 yes
[11:18:30] <robertmaxrees> disable that.
[11:18:38] <robertmaxrees> err, - delete that line, rather.
[11:18:46] <arup_r1> Yes it is present in the page
[11:18:47] <t4nk530> ohh.. okay.. thanks.. that was stupid of me
[11:18:56] <robertmaxrees> arup_r1 wait, is $('#client_surname') an input?
[11:19:03] <arup_r1> yes
[11:19:10] <robertmaxrees> you cannot append a dropdown to an input.
[11:19:13] <robertmaxrees> that's why.
[11:19:20] <arup_r1> ok
[11:19:23] <baako> BillCriswell: last question for today. how do i get a vaule of a button especially if they are so many buttons with the same class name
[11:19:35] <arup_r1> what's the rescue?
[11:19:48] <BillCriswell> $('.button').on('click', function () { console.log($(this).val()); });
[11:19:55] <robertmaxrees> arup_r1 insert the dropdown somewhere else.
[11:19:56] <arup_r1> back to my old school code ? :(
[11:20:02] <robertmaxrees> arup_r1 you can do .inserAfter() instead.
[11:20:12] <robertmaxrees> *insertAfter();
[11:20:15] <gf3> does jquery work with ember or do i have to use angular?
[11:20:17] <arup_r1> No.. why not .after() don't work
[11:20:18] <robertmaxrees> or .after()
[11:20:19] <Getty> i have to go out.... to the reality..... i am scared
[11:20:23] <arup_r1> humm
[11:20:26] <robertmaxrees> arup_r1 you can use either.
[11:20:44] <arup_r1> I know.. I read morning.. they tilda difference between them
[11:20:45] <robertmaxrees> just different syntax for them :)
[11:21:12] <robertmaxrees> gf3 you can use jquery and ember together.
[11:21:18] <gf3> good
[11:21:47] <arup_r1> working
[11:22:04] <arup_r1> now.. can you guide me about the anchor one?
[11:22:20] <robertmaxrees> arup_r1 sure.  one sec.
[11:23:04] <arup_r1> thank you.. Should I give you my updated code?
[11:23:08] <robertmaxrees> nope :)
[11:23:13] <robertmaxrees> i'm going to use my last example.
[11:23:18] <robertmaxrees> pretty trivial concept.
[11:23:45] <arup_r1> ok..
[11:24:00] <arup_r1> Please give some source link.. so that I can read it..
[11:24:04] <robertmaxrees> i will.
[11:24:08] <robertmaxrees> slow down mano.
[11:24:10] <arup_r1> thank you
[11:24:12] <robertmaxrees> i have a dayjob, too ;)
[11:24:32] <arup_r1> sorry
[11:24:35] <arup_r1> :(
[11:25:13] <robertmaxrees> alright, so - http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/3sjo0ypt/1/
[11:25:33] <robertmaxrees> see the new bit down at the bottom?
[11:25:40] <robertmaxrees> starting with $('#target').on('change', 'select', function() { ?
[11:26:04] <arup_r1> ok
[11:26:29] <robertmaxrees> you'd put your logic in there to build the link, and then do window.location.href = whateverTheLinkIs
[11:27:14] <baako> BillCriswell: can you do something like $('button name="thisname"')
[11:27:29] <robertmaxrees> $('button[name="thisname"]')
[11:27:33] <BillCriswell> baako: Yeah, use an attribute selector.
[11:27:34] <arup_r1> didn't get you
[11:27:41] <BillCriswell> Oh, as robertmaxrees showed.
[11:28:09] <robertmaxrees> arup_r1 http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/3sjo0ypt/1/
[11:28:31] <robertmaxrees> that fiddle won't work correctly because google doesn't allow you to load the site in that iframe, but you should get the ide.a
[11:29:49] <baako> BillCriswell: i think i have an issue.
[11:29:56] <arup_r1> it seems you didn't get me
[11:30:22] <arup_r1> I want if anyone select a value from the dynamic dropwdown.. then it should open in a new tab
[11:30:35] <baako> damn more headache. you see the buttons are generated by that $.get
[11:31:06] <robertmaxrees> arup_r1 you can ask the browser to do a new window - whether or not that's a new tab or actual window is up to the browser.
[11:31:08] <robertmaxrees> but that's easy.
[11:31:21] <baako> does that mean i cant get the value? i try it on my application and i couldn't but when i did on jsfiddle i could
[11:31:27] <arup_r1> makes sense
[11:31:37] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/3sjo0ypt/2/
[11:31:47] <robertmaxrees> window.open(newUrl)
[11:31:49] <arup_r1> but the code I didn't understand,,, could you chage my code
[11:31:57] <robertmaxrees> what don't you understand about it?
[11:32:13] <robertmaxrees> it's just those 4 new lines.
[11:32:31] <BillCriswell> baako: You'd need to use event delegation.
[11:32:43] <robertmaxrees> i don't know what your HTML looks like, so I don't know what the selector would look like necessarily, arup_r1
[11:32:48] <arup_r1> why are you selecting div ? $('#target').on('change', 'select', function()
[11:32:52] <BillCriswell> baako: $(document).on('click', 'button[name="thisname"]', function () { });
[11:33:04] <robertmaxrees> arup_r1 that's an event listener. check out the docs for .on()
[11:33:31] <arup_r1> I know
[11:33:57] <arup_r1> But why not taking the select list's id?
[11:33:57] <robertmaxrees> $('#target') is just for the example - you'd set that to whatever container your select is getting added to.
[11:34:04] <robertmaxrees> you could use the ID instead if you wanted.
[11:34:22] <robertmaxrees> $('#target').on('change', '#anySelectorHere', function() {});
[11:35:20] <arup_r1> as per my code... I should use then select-list1as ID
[11:35:31] <robertmaxrees> i'm not looking at your code tbh ;)
[11:35:38] <robertmaxrees> but sure.
[11:35:41] <arup_r1> look look
[11:36:53] <robertmaxrees> but you get the ide.a
[11:36:59] <arup_r1> no
[11:37:04] <arup_r1> confused
[11:37:11] <arup_r1> between selectors
[11:37:23] <robertmaxrees> $(parent).on('event', 'child', function() {});
[11:37:41] <arup_r1> ohh
[11:37:43] <robertmaxrees> you can use whatever you want for parent as long as it's a static element that exists on pageload.
[11:37:46] <arup_r1> let me try
[11:37:57] <arup_r1> got it..
[11:38:09] <arup_r1> My tubelight is now on
[11:38:37] <robertmaxrees> that's why i suggested reading the docs for .on() ;)
[11:40:01] <robertmaxrees> bbiab lunch
[11:45:53] <Scriptonaut> anyone have experience with this: http://www.briangrinstead.com/files/bindWithDelay/
[11:46:00] <Scriptonaut> I don't think it's behaving like a normal bind
[11:46:48] <Scriptonaut> if I ahve: $(document).on('input', '.quick-search', function() { console.log($(this)) });, what should $(this) refer to?
[11:46:58] <Scriptonaut> I thought it would refer to the .quick-search that fired the event
[11:47:09] <Scriptonaut> but when I use this bindWithDelay, $(this) is an array
[11:49:35] <fkt_> hi i'm very new to jquery and js, i'm trying to simply open a csv file and manipulate it..but before that, i'd simply just like to be able to write it's contents to my browser.  this is my sample scripts section, but it's not working.  can someone point me in correct direction?  http://pastebin.com/G23uFu8V
[11:50:09] <fkt_> typo in there, sample contents of z.csv *
[11:50:23] <fkt_> i get no errors and nothing written to screen
[11:51:27] <arup_r1> no if I change the drop down value it is not opening..
[11:53:02] <reyley> fkt: im no jquery expert, but the first line looks wrong
[11:53:36] <reyley> replace it with a document.ready(function)
[11:53:45] <reyley> and put the get function within the inner one
[11:54:50] <reyley> another thing you could do is change the absolute path to a relative path
[11:56:29] <decx> na that's all good, check in your network tab if the request is successful
[11:57:26] <reyley> guess i was no help then
[11:57:44] <reyley> good thing im a honey badger
[11:59:51] <vulpes-> Goodday, say I have a variable that holds a number that is the number of images i wish to place on the page. Say '4' and that current number is the image src beginning with '1.jpg' I want to place those and end with the total '4.jpg' How'd I got about doing that.
[12:00:40] <decx> make a loop
[12:00:55] <arup_r1> how would I check if `data` is empty or not here - https://gist.github.com/aruprakshit/c3f4e74e144abd87b77b#file-ajax-js-L19
[12:01:54] <vulpes-> decx: Ah right, got it, thanks :]
[12:04:27] <decx> huh.. that was easy
[12:05:56] <arup_r1> what?
[12:06:01] <arup_r1> decx: ^^
[12:13:43] <baako> quick on in ajax when you do data: some:something
[12:13:57] <baako> what is the first perimeter?
[12:15:01] <reyley> ?
[12:15:21] <reyley> you just enter each parameter in no specific order
[12:15:42] <fkt_> reyley: ok, i've made progress.  i can now print data :)
[12:16:06] <fkt_> question though..it's a huge string.  how can i replace every \n with a ,   trying this data.replace("\n",",");
[12:16:12] <fkt_> but it only replaces the first instance ot it
[12:16:16] <fkt_> s/ot/of
[12:17:16] <reyley> fkt_: you have to add a global flag to the replace
[12:17:28] <reyley> so instead of "\n"
[12:17:29] <reyley> you do
[12:17:31] <fkt_> data.replace("\n"g,",");
[12:17:32] <fkt_> ?
[12:17:38] <decx> /\n/g
[12:17:47] <reyley> yea
[12:17:50] <fkt_> trying that, didn't work, let me try again to make sure i didn't fat finger it
[12:17:54] <reyley> dont add any quotes
[12:18:01] <fkt_> ok i'll try that again
[12:18:28] <cjohnson> baako: it's a key
[12:19:40] <reyley> baako: var message = $("#messageBox").val().trim().replace(/\n/g, '<br/>');
[12:19:49] <reyley> look how i did it
[12:20:19] <baako> reyley i think you might it got fkt_
[12:20:40] <reyley> oh shit
[12:20:42] <reyley> right
[12:20:57] <reyley> fkt_: var message = $("#messageBox").val().trim().replace(/\n/g, '<br/>');
[12:21:45] <MrTopless> Hey any google api wizards?
[12:22:00] <MrTopless> I mena google maps api
[12:22:20] <fkt_> well hmm it won't replace even the first \n now   data.replace(/\n/g,",");
[12:22:31] <fkt_> i'm assuming they're
[12:22:41] <fkt_> i'm assuming they're \n , since non-global version hits the first one
[12:22:51] <cjohnson> MrTopless: don't ask to ask, just ask. also, is your question related to #jquery?
[12:24:00] <reyley> fkt_: that's strange, because i tried your replace and it works for me
[12:24:15] <reyley> did you make any other changes besides that line?
[12:24:34] <fkt_> let me show you on pastebin what i'm doing now, with sample output and input.  it has to be something super simply ;)
[12:24:39] <fkt_> i'm just so new to this
[12:24:41] <MrTopless> Well in script there is $.each, but nothing else. Everything else is google maps objects. My problem is that google js3 api is not initing. At least it seem so. Patterns are not loaded withing container div on which object is inited.
[12:25:54] <fkt_> reyley: btw, thanks for the help :)
[12:25:56] <fkt_> http://pastebin.com/i2rAEvCp
[12:26:26] <MrTopless> Using this one: http://wrightshq.com/playground/placing-multiple-markers-on-a-google-map-using-api-3/
[12:26:37] <MrTopless> not working at all, it detects the element
[12:26:37] <fkt_> so if i use data.replace("\n",",");     it will catch the first \n, and replace it.  so i don't know why /\n/g won't work honestly
[12:26:50] <MrTopless> but it seems object is not initing params on that element
[12:27:29] <reyley> fkt_: maybe, and this is a big maybe you have to set the replaced value to a new variable
[12:27:38] <reyley> try condensing the two lines into this
[12:27:50] <reyley> document.write(data.replace(/\n/g,","));
[12:28:23] <fkt_> yeah i see what are saying, but it don't answer in my head why the non-global version worked.  though, let me try
[12:28:35] <fkt_> because that version of data did get updated
[12:29:20] <fkt_> hey that worked
[12:29:27] <fkt_> very confused now
[12:29:51] <fkt_> immutable string i'd assume, but why was i able to change it previously
[12:30:05] <fkt_> or maybe i wasn't and i the replace was printing data?
[12:30:13] <reyley> fkt_: i didnt know data was immutable
[12:30:15] <reyley> but ok
[12:31:03] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[12:31:23] <robertmaxrees> data on nodes?
[12:31:38] <reyley> data response from a get request in jquery
[12:31:54] <robertmaxrees> depending on what the response is, it can be mutable.
[12:32:18] <robertmaxrees> lots of things in js don't modify things in-place anyway.
[12:32:20] <fkt_> can i get the type with something like data.typeof or something like that?
[12:32:21] <davidpardy> i have a form - when that form is submitted, the page reloads. i would like to display a success msg (ie, ‘content successfully updated’) after the page loads. But using document.ready doesnt really make sense as it has to happen on the submission/click. Whats the best way to do this?
[12:32:46] <robertmaxrees> davidpardy why are you showing that before the page reloads?
[12:33:02] <robertmaxrees> catch that the form was successfully submitted server-side and display the success message from there.
[12:33:04] <davidpardy> showing what? im not showing anything before the page loads
[12:33:29] <robertmaxrees> "...using document.ready doesnt really make sense as it has to happen on the submission/click. Whats the best way to do this?
[12:33:44] <robertmaxrees> you want to show the message on submit/sclick?
[12:34:08] <fkt_> reyley: typeof data returns string :)
[12:34:15] <davidpardy> sorry, poor wording. i would like to show the message after the page loads > the click has to occur for the page to reload
[12:34:26] <robertmaxrees> davidpardy do that on your server-side then.
[12:34:31] <robertmaxrees> that way you know that the form was submitted.
[12:34:35] <davidpardy> 1) click submit button > 2) page reloads > 3) show that form was submitted
[12:38:09] <cjohnson> page loads run entirely independent of each other, it's not up to the browser to maintain anyk ind of state between submitting a form and the page that the form redirects you to
[12:38:13] <cjohnson> even if it's the same page
[12:38:54] <robertmaxrees> you could use a cookie, but honestly the server should detect the form submit and handle things that way.
[12:39:43] <davidpardy> ok, thank you both for your input
[12:51:54] <Sansay> does anyone know if there is a way in jquery if someone clicks the link in side this div: http://pastebin.com/ttgiZXYT but only if the div has beside it the text "Check this out:" it activates?
[12:52:46] <robertmaxrees> Sansay you can test if the parent container has the text "check this out: " in it.
[12:52:52] <robertmaxrees> that'd be a bit easier.
[12:53:10] <Sansay> it might not have a parent container
[12:53:17] <Sansay> id love to do that though haha
[12:53:21] <cjohnson> all things have a parent container
[12:53:27] <cjohnson> except maybe document
[12:53:55] <robertmaxrees> Sansay i'd find another way to do this then.
[12:54:31] <robertmaxrees> there are some ways to munge what you want, but none of them are really ideal.
[12:54:34] <decx> whereever you add the "check this out:" text is the right place to add another class to the parent
[12:54:51] <decx> probably serverside
[12:54:57] <robertmaxrees> ^ or add a data attribute or something else to the anchor tag instead.
[12:56:32] <Sansay> i cant do that at all, if i could do that i could just add a class to the elements i want to fire off on lol
[12:56:45] <Sansay> its complicated but this is the way it must be done
[12:58:10] <robertmaxrees> Sansay is "check this out: " always going to precede it?
[12:58:14] <decx> well you can always parent.text().indexOf('check this out:') > -1
[12:58:34] <Sansay> yes it will
[12:58:35] <robertmaxrees> decx that doesn't guarantee the the link you clicked is the one they want.
[12:58:52] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/xozhgbbf/ hrmmm...
[12:59:06] <Sansay> decx thats what im thinking right now, but trying to see if i can get the position of the "this" so its not just searching the parent div completely
[12:59:23] <Sansay> but rather onyl check the position directly beside it
[13:00:02] <harty83> not sure if anyone can give me some insight or not as I'm not sure if it's a jquery issue or not.  But, using a data-prototype attr to create new elements.
[13:00:24] <harty83> doing a replace via regex and it works great the first time
[13:01:09] <harty83> add it back via $('#elid').data('prototype', prototype); but then the regex fails from then on.  From what I can tell with source, it should match.  Could it be an encoding issue?
[13:01:21] <robertmaxrees> harty83 we'd have to see it in action.
[13:01:35] <robertmaxrees> are you getting the value with .data(), as well?
[13:01:42] <harty83> yes
[13:01:49] <robertmaxrees> hrm.
[13:11:40] <Sansay> anyone know how to get the full html text from a this object? i cant find the documentation on it, i know this.innerHtml gets the inner html but i want the full html block for it
[13:12:00] <cjohnson> you can do $(this) btw
[13:12:10] <cjohnson> but this.textContent for straight JS
[13:12:25] <cjohnson> IE9+
[13:12:34] <robertmaxrees> $(this).html() is the jquery way
[13:12:46] <robertmaxrees> unless you want JUST the text.
[13:12:55] <cjohnson> ooh I think he wants outerHtml or whatever it is?
[13:13:06] <robertmaxrees> i guess?
[13:13:24] <harty83> does jquery auto decode entities when using .data()?
[13:17:33] <choosegoose> for the datepicker UI widget, how would I set which month I'm viewing?
[13:18:45] <robertmaxrees> defaultDate is one way.
[13:18:57] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jqueryui.com/datepicker/#option-defaultDate
[13:20:08] <choosegoose> I don't want to highlight any dates
[13:20:12] <choosegoose> I just want to change the viewed month
[13:24:00] <choosegoose> $('.ui-datepicker-next').click it is
[13:26:17] <harty83> robertmaxrees, I put together a jsfiddle at http://jsfiddle.net/LLL07x0w/1/
[13:26:30] <harty83> dumbed it down so it's not so much data
[13:26:34] <harty83> so I'm getting the options via ajax
[13:26:43] <robertmaxrees> woah.
[13:26:44] <harty83> and need to update the data-prototype with the new options
[13:26:46] <robertmaxrees> uh...
[13:27:00] <robertmaxrees> you're using a regex to update html.
[13:28:06] <harty83> trying :-) trying to make it work with symfony form prototype feature
[13:28:07] <harty83> http://symfony.com/doc/current/cookbook/form/form_collections.html#allowing-new-tags-with-the-prototype
[13:28:14] <harty83> and make it dynamic
[13:28:17] <robertmaxrees> that's a bad ide.a
[13:28:33] <robertmaxrees> http://stackoverflow.com/a/1732454/923919
[13:28:42] <robertmaxrees> regex and html don't mix.
[13:29:03] <robertmaxrees> so let's back up and talk about the core problem - can you show what you're starting with and what you need to do with it?
[13:29:26] <harty83> ha; you'd have to learn symfony PHP framework and symfony forms for that :-)
[13:29:55] <harty83> let me see what I can do and if I can get away from the whole prototype thing
[13:30:02] <harty83> maybe I can work around symfony
[13:30:17] <robertmaxrees> err, that doesn't make sense then.  you're asking a javascript/jquery problem - the issue should be relatively simple to work around if that's the case.
[13:30:44] <harty83> but all the html and JS is generated through symfony's form component which gets tricky
[13:31:16] <harty83> sorry; not JS but the data attributes
[13:31:30] <robertmaxrees> which you're manipulating via JS :)
[13:31:59] <harty83> trying to :-) so to get around the JS issue, sounds like I have to change the way I'm letting symfony handle the html.
[13:32:13] <robertmaxrees> i have no idea lol - i'm not even sure what your question is in the first place.
[13:32:35] <harty83> ha; my question was if I could get the regex to work a second time
[13:32:35] <choosegoose> when I set .datepicker('option', 'beforeShowDay', function ... ), it seems to cause the calendar to jump back to the month of the highlighted date. Is there any way to prevent this?
[13:32:49] <robertmaxrees> harty83 ostensibly, yes.
[13:32:56] <harty83> but if regex and html isn't going to play nice together, doesn't sound like that is going to be an option
[13:32:56] <robertmaxrees> but using regex on HTML is a bad idea to begin with.
[13:33:15] <robertmaxrees> it's "an option" if you treat the html at a string, but that's not really a clean optionb.  what is the regex trying to do?
[13:33:38] <harty83> simply replace the <select> options of the data-prototype string
[13:33:56] <robertmaxrees> convert into DOM nodes and use DOM methods instead.
[13:34:10] <robertmaxrees> or a jquery object and jquery methdos.,
[13:34:14] <robertmaxrees> *methods
[13:36:49] <Samian> Hi
[13:36:52] <harty83> so maybe...take original prototype and convert to DOM and store in hidden div.  Each subsequent update to the options, would then check for the dom, replace the options, and use it instead of the prototype.
[13:37:04] <robertmaxrees> harty83 in a fragment woul dbe better.
[13:37:07] <Samian> What content management system do you think this site is using? http://cs.boisestate.edu/~ckenning/teaching.php
[13:37:52] <harty83> gotcha
[13:38:00] <harty83> will give it a shot; thanks!
[13:38:42] <robertmaxrees> you can do var $myRandomThing = $(.'someDiv').data('myMarkup');  $myRandomThing.find('.aChild').text('blah'); or whatever.
[13:49:53] <harty83> robertmaxrees, many many thanks! so I just added stored the options in a variable after I did the ajax fetch.  Then in the function that creates the new element from the prototype, check for updated options and then udpate the dom accordingy. Much easier!
[13:50:32] <robertmaxrees> boom
[13:52:15] <dunpeal> OK, this is strange: according to this http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21158641/jstree-differentiate-between-left-middle-mouse-click
[13:52:27] <dunpeal> there should be event.which that tells me which button was click
[13:52:30] <dunpeal> clicked*
[13:52:42] <dunpeal> yet my event object has no .which attribute?
[13:52:57] <robertmaxrees> .which tells you how it was clicked.
[13:53:01] <robertmaxrees> did you .trigger() the event?
[13:53:51] <dunpeal> robertmaxrees: nope, I bound it exactly like in the SO post, then clicked the node.
[13:54:10] <dunpeal> the event handler triggers, but alert(which.event) prints "undefined".
[13:54:17] <robertmaxrees> event.which
[13:54:20] <dunpeal> event.which
[13:54:26] <dunpeal> sorry, typoe here, not in my code :)
[13:54:50] <dunpeal>   }).bind('select_node.jstree', function(event, data) { alert(event.which); });
[13:55:05] <robertmaxrees> what version of jquery?
[13:55:06] <dunpeal> the alert box comes up, but says "undefined"
[13:55:17] <robertmaxrees> because http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/2rxaz5ca/ works
[13:56:50] <dunpeal> robertmaxrees: v2.1.1
[13:56:59] <robertmaxrees> use .on(), not .bind()
[13:57:01] <dunpeal> and your paste works for me too
[13:57:41] <dunpeal> changed per your suggestion, still the same issue :(
[13:58:16] <robertmaxrees> can you share more info?
[13:58:21] <robertmaxrees> wait.
[13:58:29] <robertmaxrees> the event is select_node.jstree ?
[13:58:39] <dunpeal> yup, just like in the post.
[13:59:16] <robertmaxrees> that seems... wrong to me.
[13:59:24] <robertmaxrees> i'd have to see a more fleshed out example, though.
[14:03:18] <dunpeal> robertmaxrees: yeah, I'm not sure what's going on.
[14:03:44] <robertmaxrees> dunpeal console.log(event);
[14:03:51] <robertmaxrees> poke around and see if it looks weird.
[14:05:15] <dunpeal> Object { type: "select_node", timeStamp: 1421877873966, jQuery21107374014669452681: true, isTrigger: 2, namespace: "jstree", namespace_re: /(^|\.)jstree(\.|$)/, result: undefined, target: <div#request_list.jstree.jstree-1.jstree-default>, delegateTarget: <div#request_list.jstree.jstree-1.jstree-default>, currentTarget: <div#request_list.jstree.jstree-1.jstree-default>, 2 more… } select:65
[14:05:57] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[14:05:58] <robertmaxrees> lol
[14:06:12] <robertmaxrees> that doesn't show the prop on there, though there are 2 props it's not showing.
[14:06:33] <dunpeal> there aren't, this is expanded
[14:06:40] <dunpeal> but anyway, yeah, it does seem absent.
[14:06:53] <robertmaxrees> at the end of what you pasted, it says "2 more..."
[14:07:01] <robertmaxrees> it's not showing you everything, but that's fine.
[14:07:18] <dunpeal> that "2 more" is wrong
[14:07:22] <dunpeal> anyway, I found the event object
[14:07:23] <robertmaxrees> lol ok.
[14:07:24] <dunpeal> it's data.event.which
[14:07:33] <robertmaxrees> weird.
[14:07:34] <dunpeal> where data is the second argument of the callback.
[14:07:36] <dunpeal> yea.
[14:07:48] <robertmaxrees> sounds like it's getting synthetically triggered in that case.
[14:09:33] <dunpeal> can you explain?  I don't know what "synthetically triggered" means.
[14:09:43] <dunpeal> in fact I'm not sure what's happening here in general.
[14:09:44] <robertmaxrees> something did .trigger() for it.
[14:10:08] <robertmaxrees> and isn't including the original click event data in the event object.
[14:10:55] <dunpeal> robertmaxrees: right, the first argument is supposed to be the click event
[14:10:58] <dunpeal> but apparently isn't
[14:11:10] <robertmaxrees> just the event object.
[14:11:15] <robertmaxrees> you're not binding to a click event.
[14:11:34] <dunpeal> robertmaxrees: right, but the second argument has an event attribute which does
[14:11:43] <robertmaxrees> which is why i think the plugin isn't shuffling around event info correctly.
[14:13:35] <dunpeal> you're probably right.
[14:14:01] <robertmaxrees> or they changed things.  it happens.
[14:21:05] <dunpeal> robertmaxrees: yup, thanks
[14:21:52] <reyley> robertmaxrees: you told me not to use inline events. whats the particular reason against them?
[14:28:35] <robertmaxrees> reyley they mix your markup with logic.
[14:28:40] <robertmaxrees> which isn't a good thing.
[14:28:51] <robertmaxrees> you want to loosely couple those two things together.
[14:31:49] <robertmaxrees> it's also far less maintainable.
[14:37:12] <reyley> robertmaxrees: oh alright
[14:39:34] <rtownsend> http://pastebin.com/uZCmnn7c hoping to get some direction here... first time doing this. I appear to be getting data back, but it throws an error anyway... here is what I see when I go in to the console and click on the error... http://pastebin.com/zx1aMrsW
[14:40:11] <robertmaxrees> what's the error you're getting?
[14:40:32] <robertmaxrees> in the alert, i mean.
[14:41:11] <rtownsend>  Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token :
[14:41:15] <rtownsend> oh sorry 1 sec
[14:42:10] <rtownsend> robertmaxrees: jQuery1112015577171929180622_1421880103887 was not called
[14:42:46] <robertmaxrees> yeah, okay - 2 things. 1, remove the data = $.parseJSON(data); line.
[14:43:03] <robertmaxrees> 2, you don't need &callback=mycallback in your URL>
[14:43:22] <rtownsend> ok, thanks.. 1 sec :)
[14:44:16] <rtownsend> same error after those two changes... but yeah, trim the fat to find the issue hahaha
[14:44:38] <rtownsend> I just don't understand what all that stuff is getting tacked on the end of my call
[14:44:54] <robertmaxrees> you're tyring to use JSONP - you familiar with the concept?
[14:45:29] <rtownsend> vaguely :) was trying to do REST cross-domain
[14:45:33] <rtownsend> read that JSONP was the answer
[14:45:44] <robertmaxrees> does the other server allow JSONP and/or CORS?
[14:45:56] <rtownsend> I had the admin take the necessary steps to enable JSONP
[14:46:00] <rtownsend> whether he did it correctly or not..
[14:46:15] <robertmaxrees> yeah.. he didn'
[14:46:15] <rtownsend> but in that 2nd pastebin, I get a statuscode 200, so I figured it must have been enabled correctly
[14:46:19] <robertmaxrees> didn't
[14:46:36] <robertmaxrees> it should wrap all of that in a function call.
[14:49:04] <rtownsend> hm, not sure what you mean
[14:49:06] <rtownsend> all of what?
[14:49:14] <rtownsend> in an anonymous function call?
[14:51:11] <robertmaxrees> here's the rundown: so you know how you have that &callback=mycallback in your url?
[14:51:22] <robertmaxrees> the server needs to then spit out the JSON, but wrap it in mycallback()
[14:51:28] <robertmaxrees> or whatever you named that param.
[14:52:46] <robertmaxrees> so you're literally passing all of that data to the function call.
[14:55:08] <rtownsend> oh I thought I was supposed to remove the callback from the url, should I put it in the ajax parameters?
[14:55:24] <robertmaxrees> when you're using jquery, you just set the dataType to jsonp
[14:55:34] <robertmaxrees> it then adds the callback param and does the rest.
[14:58:54] <rtownsend> okay so I don't need to add a callback myself
[14:58:58] <rtownsend> how do I get at the data then?
[14:59:03] <rtownsend> I thought that was the purpose of the callback
[14:59:09] <robertmaxrees> the .done() of the ajax call.
[14:59:40] <rtownsend> ah, so the code a pasted has an anonymous function called "success"
[14:59:42] <rtownsend> not the same I guess?
[15:00:25] <robertmaxrees> same-ish
[15:01:00] <rtownsend> I feel like it should be hitting the success function since I see a 200 code in the results
[15:01:23] <robertmaxrees> invalid data can cause problems.
[15:01:45] <rtownsend> new paste since I changed a few things: http://pastebin.com/LKAWNwqk
[15:03:41] <robertmaxrees> still getting an error with that?
[15:03:56] <rtownsend> indeed
[15:04:04] <robertmaxrees> then the data getting returned is invalid.
[15:04:13] <robertmaxrees> remove 		dataType: "jsonp",
[15:04:57] <rtownsend> looks like you are correct sir... XMLHttpRequest cannot load https://bpmdev01:9443/rest/bpm/wle/v1/user/rtownsend?accept=application/x-javascript&includeTaskExperts=true&todo=jsonp&_=1421881469410. No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource. Origin 'null' is therefore not allowed access. The response had HTTP status code 401.
[15:07:18] <rtownsend> well wait
[15:07:27] <rtownsend> of course it throws 401 when I remove JSONP... I'm on a different domain
[15:07:33] <rtownsend> that makes sense
[15:08:15] <robertmaxrees> :)
[15:08:21] <robertmaxrees> so fix the data to be valid with JSONp
[15:09:20] <rtownsend> how can I control what comes back from the server though?
[15:09:29] <robertmaxrees> your server guy
[15:10:24] <rtownsend> hm okay. Thanks for the help man, appreciate your time
[15:17:06] <reyley> http://pastebin.com/wKTd0NpV
[15:17:34] <reyley> the line where i add values to an array doesnt seem to work
[15:26:42] <tapion>  is there a difference in asynchronous behavior between using .done/.fail and the success/error callbacks for ajax requests? To be more specific, When I use .done and I get my model back from the server i am having async issues with accessing attributes of the model but when I use success/error it seems to be fine, specifically when I do model.get inside my callback using .done it gives me that cryptic undefined is not a function cra
[15:26:58] <robertmaxrees> .done() and .fail() use deferreds.
[15:27:07] <robertmaxrees> but shouldn't functionally different
[15:28:04] <reyley> what is the correct way of adding more things to an associative array
[15:28:07] <tapion> any idea what would cause an issue like mine then?
[15:28:16] <robertmaxrees> reyley there are no associative arrays iun js.
[15:28:21] <robertmaxrees> just objects with properties :)
[15:28:43] <reyley> can you check my pastebin and see where i went wrong
[15:28:51] <robertmaxrees> 1 sec.
[15:28:55] <reyley> http://pastebin.com/wKTd0NpV
[15:28:56] <reyley> alright
[15:30:05] <robertmaxrees> params[$(this).prop('name')] = value;
[15:30:07] <robertmaxrees> that's what you want.
[15:31:16] <robertmaxrees> tapion have some code to share?
[15:31:55] <tapion> I'm mixing marionette with jQuery here, all I do is get a JSON object back, when I do model.get('propname') in my .done callback it says that undefined isn't a function but when I set a breakpoint right before the get call model seems to be defined, yes robertmaxrees http://pastebin.com/6FAnRF4r
[15:32:00] <tapion> incomplete but you get the idea
[15:33:11] <robertmaxrees> tapion in this case, the issue is .get(), not model
[15:33:22] <robertmaxrees> model exists but has no get method.
[15:33:23] <tapion> Can you elaborate?
[15:33:43] <tapion> but I can see it in the object lol
[15:33:51] <robertmaxrees> then something isn't making sense.
[15:34:06] <tapion> one sec gonna upload
[15:35:38] <Duvdevan> jquery is full of bugs
[15:36:08] <robertmaxrees> lols
[15:36:20] <tapion> robertmaxrees gonna PM you with a screenshot
[15:36:49] <robertmaxrees> nooo pms
[15:36:58] <tapion> oh lol
[15:36:59] <cjohnson> hah
[15:38:11] <tapion> so here http://puu.sh/eQtdx/7638336a37.png you can see theres an exception thrown
[15:39:28] <tapion> but as you see here http://puu.sh/eQtrP/de4936edd8.png
[15:39:37] <tapion> there is a get method on the object at the time of exception lol
[15:41:21] <tapion> but somehow switching this to error: success: callbacks makes it work perfectly lol
[15:41:35] <robertmaxrees> you're probably chaining to the wrong object.
[15:43:18] <tapion> Can you elaborate a bit? Not sure how thats even possible if I use the direct response from the server that's json, im chaining to the .save call which is simply an ajax call
[15:43:32] <robertmaxrees> is .save() returning a deferred object?
[15:43:36] <robertmaxrees> and the correct one, at that?
[15:46:02] <tapion> oh shit you might have just corrected a huge issue in my understanding of .save
[15:46:26] <robertmaxrees> :)
[15:47:02] <tapion> yeap it returns a promise
[15:47:04] <tapion> im dumb
[15:48:24] <reyley> robertmaxrees: i made the changes, but fiddler shows that the only params passed were the original ones
[15:48:27] <reyley> http://pastebin.com/bAiUH0Pe
[15:58:20] <robertmaxrees> reyley i'd have to see the markup in a fiddle.
[15:59:17] <skinux> Could someone help me do this right? target = $('ol li:4-child');
[15:59:18] <reyley> alright
[15:59:43] <robertmaxrees> skinux $('ol li').eq(4)
[15:59:50] <skinux> I'm trying to do CodeAcademy's tutorial for jQuery.
[16:01:27] <skinux> Here is what CodeAcademy says to do: using :nth-child() or :last-child
[16:01:36] <robertmaxrees> then use :nth-child(4)
[16:01:40] <kevireilly> skinux: just to clarify that CSS selector, `nth-child` is used like `element:nth-child(4)`
[16:03:04] <skinux> target = $('ol li:nth-child(4)'); is not working either
[16:03:48] <robertmaxrees> what are you expecting?
[16:05:35] <robertmaxrees> because http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/g3ucz4rL/
[16:08:00] <reyley> http://jsfiddle.net/ny2ompa0/1/
[16:08:44] <reyley> if you have fiddler, you can see the params sent are only type
[16:10:43] <robertmaxrees> this fiddle doesn't work.
[16:11:07] <reyley> what
[16:11:09] <reyley> hold on
[16:11:21] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/ny2ompa0/2/
[16:11:50] <robertmaxrees> no reason to use a switch where you were.
[16:14:19] <reyley> fiddler still shows only the type param in the POST request
[16:14:47] <reyley> hmmm it might be stackoverflow time
[16:14:53] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[16:15:19] <robertmaxrees> did you swap to what i just gave you?
[16:15:27] <reyley> i did
[16:15:51] <reyley> i uncommented the post since thats the part i could check to see if it worked
[16:16:14] <reyley> oh you added a console log
[16:16:21] <robertmaxrees> yeah, to check the params object.
[16:16:27] <robertmaxrees> take a look at it.
[16:17:02] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/ny2ompa0/3/ btw
[16:17:23] <reyley> oh
[16:17:40] <reyley> console tells me the added params had undefined values
[16:17:52] <robertmaxrees> right.
[16:17:52] <reyley> thats probably why they didnt get passed
[16:17:55] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[16:18:58] <skinux> I don't know what I'm expecting. I'm trying to do what CodeAcademy tutorial is telling me to do. It's not seeing what it wants to see.
[16:19:08] <robertmaxrees> if ($(this).prop('tagName') === 'input') { isn't what you think it is.
[16:19:13] <reyley> the reason i was using a switch was because i thought for a moment a radio button had a different tag name
[16:19:13] <robertmaxrees> that'll always be false.
[16:19:40] <reyley> and if i wanted to add that as an option, i would have to get its value in a different way
[16:19:57] <reyley> skinux: can you show
[16:19:59] <robertmaxrees> check this out: http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/ny2ompa0/4/
[16:20:47] <skinux> This is what I'm doing. target = $('ol li:nth-child(4)'); and here is the hint it gives: You may also modify things indirectly by using :nth-child() or :last-child
[16:21:00] <reyley> robertmaxrees: they're capitalized
[16:21:02] <reyley> ohhhhhh
[16:21:06] <robertmaxrees> reyley ;)
[16:21:38] <robertmaxrees> skinux what is is asking you to do?
[16:21:41] <robertmaxrees> like, what's the actual question?
[16:22:16] <skinux> To set 'target' equal to the forth LI of an OL which is inside an LI of a UL
[16:23:01] <robertmaxrees> maybe they want you to target it through the ul li ol li:nth-child(4)
[16:25:39] <skinux> I tried that
[16:26:24] <reyley> is it a specific li in the ul?
[17:08:50] <reyley> how would i pass a server side generated variable to a js function in a file
[17:09:38] <robertmaxrees> the gist is you write out a script tag where you set a js var to that output.
[17:10:16] <kevireilly> reyley: likely want to request it via AJAX or if you've got power over the template, you could inline the variable as part of template generation
[17:10:21] <reyley> robertmaxrees: alright thanks
[17:10:38] <robertmaxrees> reyley if you want it after pageload, you'll want to expose an API endpoint for it.
[17:11:31] <reyley> the uid variable in question is prepared by the controller before page load
[17:12:28] <robertmaxrees> there you go then.
[17:23:01] <baako> robertmaxrees dont know if this is possible but stop trigger the waitingList function every 5 mins without my broswer network keep all the logs http://kopy.io/XUwbv
[17:23:33] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[17:24:08] <robertmaxrees> oh, you want to cancel the setInterval()?
[17:24:39] <robertmaxrees> var waitingListRefresh = setInterval(waitingList, 50000); clearInterval(waitingListRefresh);
[17:24:45] <baako> robertmaxrees: i dont know but i still want whatever in the waitingList function to do what it does every 5 seconds
[17:25:10] <robertmaxrees> you just said you want to stip triggering it.
[17:25:16] <robertmaxrees> and thgen you said you want ot kepe triggering it.
[17:25:45] <baako> robertmaxrees: i want to trigger it every 5 secons
[17:25:56] <baako> but in my inspect element "NETWORK"
[17:26:15] <baako> the amount of request logged into it from this one function is mind blowing
[17:26:20] <robertmaxrees> right.
[17:26:29] <robertmaxrees> because you're making an ajax request every 5 seconds.
[17:27:12] <baako> robertmaxrees: yep
[17:27:24] <robertmaxrees> you can't prevent the logging from happening.
[17:27:50] <baako> robertmaxrees: but it is bad for it to have too much on the log
[17:27:57] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[17:27:58] <robertmaxrees> no it's not.
[17:28:13] <baako> okay
[17:28:41] <robertmaxrees> now doing an ajax request every 5 seconds, regardless of whether or not the prior one was successful is a little dangerous.
[17:36:46] <reyley> is it possible to tell somehow if an input has been modified
[17:36:54] <reyley> or must i set a listener
[17:37:02] <robertmaxrees> you have to set a listener.
[17:37:09] <reyley> ok
[17:37:18] <adamellsworth> I can't seem to udpate a certain data attribute using the general syntax: var x = 'test'; $('.message').data('action', test);
[17:37:20] <robertmaxrees> alternatively, you can store the state on pageload and then check later to see if it's the same.
[17:37:34] <robertmaxrees> adamellsworth and you're tyring to modify data-action ?
[17:37:47] <adamellsworth> yeah, give it a new value
[17:37:52] <robertmaxrees> that should work fine, then.
[17:37:56] <robertmaxrees> any console errors or anything?
[17:38:10] <adamellsworth> nope, I'll see if i can't reproduce it in jsbin
[17:40:21] <robertmaxrees> adamellsworth let's clarify - how are you verifying the value has been updated?
[17:40:52] <adamellsworth> via the inspector in the elements pane
[17:41:31] <rangergord_> is there a site that'll let me upload unpopular javascript libraries to, so I can use them as external resources in jsfiddle?
[17:41:51] <adamellsworth> and the getter give's back the same value too
[17:42:24] <robertmaxrees> adamellsworth that's why.
[17:42:36] <robertmaxrees> the inspector doesn't reflect .data()
[17:42:50] <robertmaxrees> rangergord_ are they available on github?
[17:42:53] <robertmaxrees> if so, you can use rawgit
[17:43:01] <robertmaxrees> https://rawgit.com/
[17:43:25] <rangergord_> thanks!
[17:43:37] <reyley> you can also upload them to a server and include them as an external file
[17:43:40] <reyley> but ok
[17:43:44] <rangergord_> i dont have a server!
[17:43:59] <reyley> oh no
[17:44:18] <adamellsworth> what do you mean doesn't reflect .data()?
[17:44:21] <rangergord_> I should though...VPS seem so cheap. But I'd be worried about having to maintain security...like I dont want to have to worry abotu someone hacking it and using it for illegal activities then I get in trouble
[17:44:34] <robertmaxrees> adamellsworth .data() edits a cached copy of that element's data attributes.
[17:44:40] <adamellsworth> oh
[17:44:42] <robertmaxrees> .data() edits this cached version,m instead of the markup.
[17:44:42] <adamellsworth> hmm
[17:44:46] <robertmaxrees> which is smart.
[17:44:51] <robertmaxrees> do not change to using .attr() or .prop()
[17:45:39] <robertmaxrees> verify the changes by using .data() again
[17:46:12] <adamellsworth> so $('.messages').attr('data-active', 'test')?
[17:46:30] <robertmaxrees> i JUST said to not do that ;)
[17:46:45] <robertmaxrees> console.log($('.messages').data('test'));
[17:54:21] <adamellsworth> but data('test') will always be undefined. so how do I get/set the non-cached version? or should I only deal with the cached version?
[17:55:15] <Tagor> Can someone tell me how I can pass an array of values in $.post instead of setting individual vars?   $.post( "test.php", { name: "John", time: "2pm" } );
[17:55:49] <robertmaxrees> adamellsworth only with the cached
[17:56:12] <robertmaxrees> Tagor what do you mean?
[17:57:14] <adamellsworth> use $.ajax with type post and then: data: JSON.stringify({ people: [{name: "jon", time: "2pm"}]}
[17:58:00] <robertmaxrees> shouldn't need to stringify up front.
[17:58:13] <Tagor> robertmaxrees: I have an array with post values: var postValues = new Array(); postValues['name'] = 'john'; postValues['time'] = 'test';  that I want to post
[17:58:22] <systemfault> fml...
[17:58:46] <systemfault> Tagor: In JS, arrays are for numeric indexes only.
[17:58:49] <robertmaxrees> Tagor that's not valid.
[17:58:57] <robertmaxrees> you're making an array and then setting regular proprties on it.
[17:59:06] <rangergord_> does the order of scripts in a page? i'm getting an assertion because a lib requires jquery ui, but i added jquery ui as an external resource and it still does it. Could it be because the lib is listed before jquery ui in the resource list?
[17:59:17] <robertmaxrees> and don't use new Array(); , just do an array literal.
[17:59:27] <systemfault> The PHP syndrome.
[17:59:31] <rangergord_> i dont see a awy to reorder them
[17:59:33] <systemfault> Where everything is an array.
[17:59:43] <rangergord_> sup systemfault
[17:59:53] <systemfault> rangergord_: Order matter for scripts.
[18:00:18] <Tagor> systemfault / robertmaxrees: hmmm, how can I put this '{ name: "John", time: "2pm" }' in a var or something? Because the values are conditional. I want something like this: var postValues = { name: "John", time: "2pm" }; $.post( "test.php", postValues );
[18:00:18] <rangergord_> man that sentence I wrote was terrible. I'm talking about jsfiddle here, since I didn't mention it.
[18:00:49] <rangergord_> i'll remove them and readd them in the righto rder i geuss
[18:01:02] <systemfault> *matters
[18:01:20] <systemfault> Tagor: var obj = {}; obj.name = 'John'; obj.time = '2pm';
[18:01:42] <Tagor> systemfault: thanks, that is what I need
[18:12:18] <baako> hi guys i have this ajax http://kopy.io/AMUp4 but i dont understand why it display my website again in the div instead of the return message
[18:48:19] <FatBoyXPC> How would I go about troubleshooting why my eventReceive is not firing on my fullcalendar?
[18:48:34] <FatBoyXPC> This is specifically for dropping an external event onto the calendar
[18:59:48] <jeffreylevesque> if i have a program that scrapes the content from another site.  Is it preferred for me to analyze the data in python, or to send it via ajax to javascript, and analyze it in js?
[19:00:45] <Primero> how set the fontsize of input text with css, what is the name of font of the box
[19:00:52] <BillCriswell> jeffreylevesque: What are you doing with the data after you analyze it?
[19:01:13] <BillCriswell> Primero: inspect the element and look at the font family.
[19:01:45] <rangergord_> Has anyone here used a library called Fancytree? I'd like my table to use a different icon for the nodes in this example:   http://jsfiddle.net/uv3bL07x/3/   , depending on whether Type is Text or Image. Their doc at http://wwwendt.de/tech/fancytree/demo/index.html#sample-theming.html proposes various approaches for custom icons, but I couldn't get any of them to work. :/
[19:02:02] <jeffreylevesque> BillCriswell: well, the user supplies a url that contains a json structure.  this url is sent to python, where the content is parsed from the external webpage.
[19:02:23] <jeffreylevesque> Specifically, i am given an external webpage containing data on earthquakes
[19:02:30] <rangergord_> and of course only like 2 people on this planet have ever used this library
[19:02:38] <rangergord_> as evidenced by google search results :P
[19:02:41] <jeffreylevesque> i'm going to parse the data for earthquakes within 100mi of my area
[19:02:49] <jeffreylevesque> and determine the highest magnitude
[19:02:56] <jeffreylevesque> within the last x days
[19:03:07] <FatBoyXPC> I'm using FullCalendar, and setting up an external events to be drag then dropped onto the calendar. The eventReceive I have setup isn't firing. Any ideas on how to troubleshoot this?  I'm using this inside a meteor project, if that matters.
[19:03:42] <BillCriswell> jeffreylevesque: Ok.
[19:03:51] <reyley> rangergord_: https://github.com/mar10/fancytree/issues/204
[19:04:03] <reyley> it was solved with attribute manipulation
[19:04:12] <BillCriswell> That seems like something you'd want to do on the server side and organize in a fashion so it's easier to query later.
[19:04:23] <reyley> try to find the docs hes mentioning in that github issue
[19:05:20] <jeffreylevesque> BillCriswell: that's what i'm leaning towards now.  For a large load, is it faster for it to be clientside, or ok on serverside?
[19:06:08] <BillCriswell> jeffreylevesque: I wouldn't want to send large loads directly to the client.
[19:06:14] <reyley> jeffreylevesque: it depends, but generally a server is more powerful
[19:06:41] <jeffreylevesque> BillCriswell: like have each client perform the logic vs the server doing the logic for each client
[19:07:00] <BillCriswell> jeffreylevesque: I agree with what reyley said.
[19:07:43] <BillCriswell> You never know how powerful the client is, that's why I try to make sure it's not doing any more work than it has to.
[19:07:55] <jeffreylevesque> BillCriswell, reyley: thank you
[19:56:30] <arup_r> I am trying to make a select list value as a link on selection.. But it is not happening-- Any idea where I am wrong? https://gist.github.com/aruprakshit/7511cffc7fe192a08193
[20:27:03] <monstordh> I guess I don't know how to do a proper comparison. Can someone help me here? Here's my very simple query: http://jsfiddle.net/monstordh/Lf5134m2/
[20:28:54] <monstordh> In case you don't want to take the time to click, here is the basic query: if ($("article").class() == "wrapper") {}
[20:29:22] <monstordh> How do I see if the class name of an element matches my criteria?
[20:31:58] <monstordh> I was first trying it this way: if ($("article.wrapper") {}
[20:32:34] <monstordh> Actually that works :)
[20:32:47] <monstordh> Now to what I'm ultimately trying to do. I need to negate it
[20:33:02] <monstordh> If the article class is NOT "wrapper"…
[20:33:05] <monstordh> suggestions?
[20:37:23] <Uhkis> ?api hasclass @ monstordh
[20:37:37] <monstordh> :) that sounds promising :)
[20:37:48] <Uhkis> oh, bot is dead
[20:37:53] <Uhkis> RIP
[20:38:35] <Uhkis> monstordh: http://jsfiddle.net/Lf5134m2/1/ anyways
[20:38:39] <monstordh> hm… how would I negate that?
[20:39:00] <Uhkis> !$(...
[20:39:27] <monstordh> Yay!
[20:39:31] <monstordh> thank you!!!
[20:41:19] <Uhkis> monstordh: np
[20:43:43] <monstordh> grrrrr… I can get it to work with jsfiddle, but not my project. must be doing something wrong
[20:53:19] <baako> hi guys how hide this div e.g. http://jsfiddle.net/mos62t6d/
[20:53:43] <baako> updated http://jsfiddle.net/mos62t6d/1/
[20:54:08] <baako> when the button is clicked i only want to hide the div that is related to the button
[20:56:18] <shoky> baako: http://jsfiddle.net/mos62t6d/2/
[21:00:11] <baako> shoky thank you very much
[21:51:03] <gtristan> if I want to catch all mouseover events for the page, how would I do it ?
[21:51:19] <gtristan> with $(window).on ('mouseover', function () { }); ?
[21:51:28] <gtristan> or $(document).on () ?
[21:51:46] <gtristan> or perhaps $('body').on() ?
[22:12:36] <gtristan> is it possible to receive mousemove on 'body' ?
[22:12:56] <gtristan> and will it be triggered during drag operations ?
[22:16:13] <Uhkis> hover event on the whole page sounds like a huge performance killer
[22:16:29] <gtristan> Uhkis, of course it would be if it's not done responsibly
[22:16:33] <Uhkis> tichels is a pm spammer
[22:16:58] <gtristan> But I'm seeing that I can't seem to get the mousemove/mouseover events during a drag
[22:17:14] <gtristan> pretty annoying :-S
[22:18:27] <gtristan> maybe I can handle *dragover* on the page
[22:18:32] <gtristan> ah that might work
[23:13:54] <Cork> gtristan: you normally bind the event handler on document
[23:13:58] <Cork> not body
[23:14:12] <gtristan> Cork, ah thanks
