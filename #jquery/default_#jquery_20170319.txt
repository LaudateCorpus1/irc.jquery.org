[00:49:58] <aro> is it possible to connect two lists using sortable, but have an item from list two be dragged to list 1 multiple times?
[03:56:26] <lenswipee> hi, is there a future for jquery?

[05:43:18] <uskerine> hi, I would like to make a "submit" type button behave like a "button" type
[05:43:56] <uskerine> is that possible? reason is that I am using bootstrap validator which handles the enable/disable submit button automatically, but then my submit is via AJAX
[05:50:11] <uskerine> How do I prevent a submit button to launch the GET with the parameters from form fields?
[06:27:19] <firas> guys I have a page with several divs that have multiple IDs, One can navigate through scrolling or through clicking on the navbar which has the page#id which will take you to that div but the scroll or the movement to that div in instantuous meaning it happens so damn fast, I want to slow it down or animate it so that one could know that it's moving .. any ideas ? thanks in advance
[13:06:11] <Alturic> Hey guys, I have a json object, with 1, 2 and 3 as the keys. I have a return of 1 through a function. So realistically I'm looking to see if 1 exists as a key in the array. $.inArray(1, array) is returning -1 though?
[13:07:20] <Alturic> I mean, I might not need to "simply" see if a key exists in the JSON, I need to see if the key exists and then grab a key's value inside that primary key.
[13:08:48] <shoky> Alturic: obj[key]  gets you the value at that key
[13:09:34] <Alturic> ... friggin' doh!
[13:09:36] <shoky> Alturic: arrays and objects are not the same thing, btw..
[13:10:20] <shoky> and you don't need jquery for handling either of them :P
[13:11:34] <Alturic> So, a JSON (wno't say array or object yet :P) isn't an array of objects?
[13:11:48] <shoky> JSON is something completely separate..
[13:11:56] <shoky> you have a JS object, not a JSON object
[13:12:15] <Alturic> So even though on the PHP side I json_encode it, and it's JSON valid... it's not JSON?
[13:12:18] <shoky> JSON is a textual format for representing data, e.g. when sending it over the network
[13:12:35] <shoky> the text that your server is responding with IS json
[13:12:43] <shoky> the object that you parse that JSON into, is NOT json :P
[13:12:50] <Meteohr> Hey guys, I have a very simple question: I have two wrapper divs (same class) and in each wrapper there are fields with the same class. I want to get the index >inside< each wrapper for the elements with this class. I made a codepen for this: http://codepen.io/anon/pen/xqpMEL
[13:14:30] <Meteohr> So if you click on each div, you can see that jquery is indexing the divs like this: 0,1,2,3
[13:14:38] <Meteohr> I'd like it to be 0,1 and 0,1
[13:14:49] <shoky> Alturic:  and in JS (and also in JSON) you can have objects, and arrays,  and arrays of objects, sure.  but an array is still different than an object.. arrays have ordered numbered keys and a .length property. objects have arbitrary unordered string keys
[13:16:38] <Alturic> shoky: I see, so then I DO have an array of object. I have the main JSON array(?), with 3 keys and then each key has key:values that are strictly strings?
[13:17:02] <Alturic> Let me do it this way and just show you, so then I can get my terminology right. :P
[13:17:34] <Alturic> shoky: https://hastebin.com/mufasikuna.scala
[13:17:54] <shoky> Meteohr: parent.children('.field').index(this)
[13:18:34] <Meteohr> $(this).parent.children('.field).index(this) ?
[13:19:12] <shoky> Alturic: there are no arrays there. you have an object with 3 keys (that happen to be numbers), whose values are objects
[13:19:26] <Meteohr> shoky: wow, it seems to work, thank you so much !
[13:19:35] <shoky> np
[13:19:48] <Alturic> shoky: Interesting.
[13:20:23] <Alturic> shoky: Now here's the problem I was originally trying to solve when I got into this. So I'm trying to use the (it's a select, and the value is the key id's) selected value to then pull the "direct_cost" value associated with that key. Now, it does "work", but since my default option is blank, it obviously throws an error that it can't find that "cost" since there is no "" key until you actually
[13:20:23] <Alturic> select.
[13:20:25] <shoky> Alturic: arrays are with [].  objects are with {}
[13:20:38] <Alturic> shoky: Aha!
[13:20:42] <Alturic> Now that makes sense to me.
[13:23:36] <shoky> Alturic you can generally check if a key has a truthy value with:  if (obj[key]) ..   or if some falsy values like 0 matter, then  if (obj[key] != null)  ,  and there are other ways if you also care about nulls/undefined but you probably don't
[13:23:46] <Alturic> Oh, and the reason I don't believe I can "wait" until there's an actual value selected from the drop-down, is because there's a prior field that when that's changed it runs the calculation function since it's a multiplier value. So when(ever) that prior value is changed it runs the calculation function, so like I said on the very first "prior value" change it throws an error that it can't pull
[13:23:46] <Alturic> a direct_cost since the default value is '' which of course doesn't exist in the object.
[13:24:23] <shoky> you can also just check if the current value is '' or whatever..?
[13:31:42] <Alturic> shoky: Yea, I just wrapped the return in an if statement. One last question if I may, I used to use notepad++ and recently switched to PhpStorm (with ESLint plugin) and when I run the inspector it says I have tons of duplicate selectors, which I do. If you wanted to follow best-practice/standards(?) do you typically do var selector = $('#bidSectionThreeInputDebrisDisposalCubicYards') and then
[13:31:42] <Alturic> always call that selector variable?
[13:31:58] <Alturic> I do like how it would cut down on debugging, knowing where that ONE single selector is set, but yea.
[13:45:28] <Azrael_-> hi
[13:50:38] <Azrael_-> i try to substitute marquee and was successful with jquery.marquee. but now i need to integrate it into an existing environment which uses mootools. i realized mootools and jquery don't properly coexist. can you give me a suggestion how to get a marquee effect working with existing mootols?
[14:12:55] <Caspan_> I have a line of code that will add a class 'selected if you click on the TD
[14:12:58] <Caspan_> works great
[14:13:37] <Caspan_> i want to also get the data-id field and find any other TD with the same Data-id field and add the selected class to them as well
[14:14:07] <Caspan_> basically i have two TDs beside each other one holds a name the other holds the value when i click one i want both to be clicked
[14:14:25] <Caspan_> any ideas
[14:16:42] <Caspan_> $($(this).data('id')).addClass('selected') ??
[14:17:09] <Caspan_> get the current data-id of the element i clicked on
[14:17:23] <Caspan_> then add the selected class to all of them
[14:18:21] <Caspan_> sorry
[14:18:21] <Caspan_> $($(this).data('id')).data('id').addClass('selected');
[14:18:56] <Caspan_> im all messed up lol
[14:23:20] <Caspan_> $('[data-id="3766"]').addClass('selected')  so that works in my console
[14:23:36] <Caspan_> but i cant get that to workin my code
[14:27:49] <Caspan_> $('[data-id="$(this).data('id')"]').addClass('selected') ; i cannot get the select in th center to resolve to my ID though
[14:35:03] <pavonia> Something like $('[data-id=' + $(this).data('id') + ']').addClass('selected');
[14:35:40] <shoky> Alturic: yes ;)
[14:50:58] <Caspan_> ahhh the +
[14:53:11] <Caspan_> pavonia: Thanks worked perfect
[15:17:50] <robsco> I need some style help, my code is quickly getting convoluted.  I use Bootstrap modals/overlays for a lot of my site, logging in, etc.  my code is getting a bit messy, on-click show modal, maybe with an ajax call before-hand, then more on-click events, with more ajax calls, etc.  is there a good resource or advice for keeping my code sane?
[18:21:49] <uskerine> Hi, I would like to allow user click on this and catch the event in jquery to do my stuff. Any tips?   <span class="ir" id="decrease_product"><i class="icon fa fa-sort-desc"></i></span>

[20:04:10] <MathNeverEnds> hey im trying to update a blank image on my client with a source received from server
[20:04:11] <MathNeverEnds> function(data) { }
[20:04:23] <MathNeverEnds> $('#image').attr('src', imagesource);
[20:04:30] <MathNeverEnds> not the first line
[20:04:36] <MathNeverEnds> but attr is not resolved
[20:27:24] <MathNeverEnds> $.post("login",{brand: brand, line: line, shade: shade, number: number}, function(data) {
[20:27:24] <MathNeverEnds>                     var imagesource = data;
[20:27:24] <MathNeverEnds>                     $('#image').src=imagesource;
[20:27:24] <MathNeverEnds>                     document.getElementById("image").src=imagesource;
[20:27:24] <MathNeverEnds>                 } );
[20:27:31] <MathNeverEnds> anyone know why that might now work?
[20:27:44] <MathNeverEnds> ive got 2 different ways to update src
[20:27:48] <MathNeverEnds> neither are working
