[00:35:26] <solace> alright, what on earth is happening when I try to load a script from another site and it can use the jquery stuff that wordpress provides, but then I use the same script hosted on my own site and it says $ is not a function and I have to load jquery again but that breaks the rest of the site
[00:36:00] <solace> the script in particular is the coinwidget script and I'm trying to switch to fully functioning HTTPS with Let's Encrypt, it's working so far but I can't have anything embedded from other sites, that includes coinwidget
[00:36:57] <solace> I tried doing some thing to defer the script until jquery is loaded, but that still gave me a $ is not a function error
[00:45:57] <n00bdev> if im trying to to do a http get on a specfic route like /industries/:industry_id, am i better off using $.ajax()?
[02:52:34] <techie28> hii..
[02:53:36] <techie28> can onbeforeunload pop up be overridden anyhow?
[03:09:15] <estodiMania> Goodmorning
[03:09:54] <estodiMania> I need to retrieve data from the database with JQuery, Ajax call. Everything works fine but when a object is empty it gives me a error. How can i fix this?
[03:11:31] <techie28> why not use object.keys?
[03:12:16] <techie28> estodiMania: what is the error?
[03:20:16] <estodiMania> aah i fixed it already, my own stupid mistake :) sorry!
[04:04:45] <noregret> is there a jquery form validation plugin somewhere?
[04:05:00] <noregret> a recommended one, ie
[04:47:33] <worknick> hi
[04:48:30] <worknick> how can i only change the action of form onclick without performing that action? when i do this.('action',link) it actually tries to visit "link". thats not what i want. i only want to change it. so when user click on it it will go to newly changed action url.
[04:48:36] <worknick> form action that is.
[05:12:22] <estodiMania> Prevent default?
[05:13:00] <estodiMania> @wornick
[05:18:30] <warden23> Hello is it possible to use jquery to validate a form to an additional radio group for every character this added to an input?
[05:19:01] <warden23> So basically I have an input that has numbers, every time I added a number a radio group / input is added where I can select an additional option.
[05:19:24] <warden23> So if I had 01 then being two characters/digits then I would have two input boxes that are revealed?
[05:22:41] <warden23> Anyone? :)
[05:24:20] <warden23> This is possible in jquery at least let me know that please..
[05:25:06] <Uhkis> it is possible
[05:26:06] <warden23> So jquery would be where I search or javascript?
[05:26:22] <warden23> Any direction at all would be awesome
[05:26:33] <Uhkis> listen to input, check if last value is more than new value, add/remove inputs depending on it
[05:27:11] <warden23> ok ill try and work with that knowledge
[05:27:15] <warden23> thanks
[05:27:48] <Uhkis> probably wont be longer than 10 lines either
[05:30:30] <warden23> oh okay
[05:32:41] <warden23> http://jsfiddle.net/scds974a/5/ this is what im working with
[05:33:23] <warden23> Trying to make it so only the first lot of skeleton parts are shown and as I add a value another radio lot is revealed
[05:33:36] <warden23> Is that the right mentality or is there a better way?
[05:35:07] <warden23> sorry meant this version: http://jsfiddle.net/scds974a/6/
[06:28:15] <warden23> Uhkis: http://jsfiddle.net/scds974a/8/ I'm getting there.. do you know how I add a > 1 length to that code? doesn't seem to be working..
[06:28:39] <warden23> I put it under the else, but that doesnt work..
[06:29:58] <warden23> I can just copy and paste it to 2 statements but I want to do a cleaner version.
[06:40:19] <warden23> Yay worked it out http://jsfiddle.net/scds974a/9/ but you did help put me on the right path thank you Uhkis
[06:40:22] <warden23> :)
[06:45:28] <Uhkis> warden23: well that's completely different of what i thought it would be
[06:47:30] <warden23> lol
[06:47:43] <warden23> So there is a better way? or just a different way?
[06:48:29] <shoky_> warden23: uhm in line 4  you have if (("#mcnumber").length > 1)      missing a $  and .val() ;p
[06:48:37] <shoky_> you're just checking the length of that string :P
[06:48:46] <jop008> Hi maybe wrong forum I have php page generating json in chrome I got headers to big
[06:48:49] <jop008> using ajax
[06:49:09] <jop008> in firefox the size of the headers is measured as 163kb
[06:49:23] <jop008> so under the maximum of 256kb
[06:49:28] <jop008> wat to do?
[06:49:32] <shoky_> warden23: also even if you had that right, that else condition would never be true. because if it's > 1 then it's also > 0, meaning the first if condition would be true if length > 1 and you would never enter the "else". you want to switch the order maybe
[06:50:05] <Uhkis> warden23: thought you were actually adding and removing, not showing and hiding
[06:50:34] <warden23> Uhkis: I wanted to add and remove but I couldn't find how to do it so I had to find another way
[06:50:58] <warden23> shoky_ yeah true, I mean with that if I backspace the 3 still remain visible
[06:51:10] <warden23> But wish they would be hidden/removed again
[06:51:45] <shoky_> well then you can hide them
[06:52:18] <warden23> http://jsfiddle.net/scds974a/10/ like that?
[06:52:46] <warden23> I would insert the hide() in the else { } correct?
[06:53:13] <shoky_> warden23: you switched the order which is good, but you're still checking the length of the string "#mcnumber" in line 4 ;p
[06:53:35] <shoky_> warden23: why ask instead of try ?
[06:54:31] <warden23> http://jsfiddle.net/scds974a/11/
[06:54:32] <shoky_> anyways the last else would only be entered if the length is not > 0, i.e. if the input is empty
[06:54:38] <warden23> I did try and it failed lol
[06:54:56] <shoky_> well, you need to sit and think about the logic...
[06:55:47] <shoky_> btw no reason to use $("#mcnumber") in line 4  and not just $(this) ..
[06:56:02] <shoky_> and another btw you can just use this.value instead of $(this).val()
[06:57:31] <shoky_> also don't use [id=...]  juse use #...
[06:59:22] <warden23> Ok let me try all that one sec
[07:00:19] <Uhkis> warden23: https://jsfiddle.net/hexpwfo6/ something like that
[07:01:01] <Uhkis> var names are kinda wonky but still, it works as you first described afaik :p
[07:02:35] <warden23> that's awesome thanks Uhkis will keep that and finish this way and implement whatever fits the end product best, you and shoky_ are awesome!
[07:05:03] <warden23> shoky_ do you know why this doesn't work? http://jsfiddle.net/scds974a/12/ ever since i added the third else if
[07:05:51] <shoky_> warden23 you have a syntax error. check your console
[07:05:59] <warden23> ah ye sjust saw my extra }
[07:06:26] <warden23> but if I enter 3 numbers and then backspace and remove them all and add 1 number
[07:06:35] <warden23> it still shows the second number div
[07:06:48] <shoky_> then your logic is wrong
[07:07:51] <shoky_> go through it , pretend you're the computer going through the code, checking those conditions..  (or use a step debugger so you don't have to pretend)
[07:07:58] <warden23> else if (this.value.length == 0) { doesn't that mean that logic would tell me that if the value is zero or 1 then it hides the other divs?
[07:08:34] <shoky_> that only checks if the input is empty, and it only checks it if that else is reached, i.e. if the previous conditions were false
[07:08:40] <shoky_> that's what "else" means
[07:08:43] <shoky_> only if the previous were false.
[07:09:26] <shoky_> if (a) { .. } else if (b) { ... } else if (c) { .. }
[07:09:33] <shoky_> only one of those ... will ever run
[07:09:46] <warden23> ok one sec
[07:10:14] <shoky_> your 3rd and 4th conditions are the same btw... < 1 and == 0
[07:10:20] <shoky_> both mean "input is empty"
[07:13:55] <warden23> if(this.value.length > 1) { that means 1 or above correct or up to 1?
[07:16:11] <shoky_> warden23  > 1  means bigger than 1
[07:16:20] <shoky_> >= 1  means 1 or bigger
[07:17:26] <rogger_h> Anyone spanish here?
[07:17:41] <shoky_> warden23  btw you should use keyup event instead of keypress maybe, to make sure that the .value you're reading is the value after the character was added to the input, not before
[07:18:45] <shoky_> should make stuff make more sense ;p
[07:23:59] <warden23> shoky_ http://jsfiddle.net/scds974a/14/ almost have it
[07:24:23] <warden23> So if it has 1 character I dont' see the other two divs
[07:25:39] <warden23> Except for some reason if I enter 1 number it's showing 2 divs and not 1
[07:26:02] <warden23> I thought what I have now makes logical sense but I'm wrong
[07:27:45] <warden23> even tried changing the <= on line 4
[07:28:30] <warden23> shoky_ : yay may have it http://jsfiddle.net/scds974a/15/
[07:30:06] <warden23> Yup I do thanks so much for your patience shoky_ your a legend!
[08:13:57] <Miles8of9> $.fn.myFunc = function (method) {  <--- could you please explain me why there is "method" here instead of opts, callback?
[08:17:18] <shoky_> Miles8of9: you can call the argument whatever you want. it depends on what the purpose is.. maybe whoever wrote that wanted users to be able to call .myFunc('stop')  or .myFunc('show')  for example, passing the "method" name to run
[08:17:51] <shoky_> Miles8of9: for example all jquery-ui widgets use that convention for calling the widget's "methods"
[08:18:23] <shoky_> and e.g. you'd call it "opts" if passing in options. and "callback" if passing in a callback
[08:19:10] <Miles8of9> ah ok thanks

[10:09:04] <Mark____> could anyone take alook at this and tell me why isn’t working on my webpage? is it because this jquery plugin is built using lower jquery version? http://www.jqueryscript.net/demo/Creating-Chrome-style-Tabs-with-jQuery-jQuery-UI-Chrome-Tabs/

[11:28:50] <worknick> how to correctly removeclass and add class on span of a specific div? i am doing this $('#'+frid+' span').removeclass("btn-primary"); and getting error

[12:01:14] <gp> I am trying to create a dynamic first page for a jqm site so that the landing page is always refreshed upon navigating back to it but I cannot seem to change the url used to determine if the first page is the requested page.  Can anyone help me with that?
[12:02:25] <gp> Here is a paste of a simple snippet I am trign to use http://dpaste.com/3AGE9GB I change the url before initializing but isFirstPageUrl still returns true for the original loaded url
[12:03:41] <gp> I looked at the isFirstPageUrl method and I noticed that it doesn't take the page data-url attr into account =/
[12:05:33] <Duvdevan> can anyone send me an invite in #php?
[12:11:11] <Uhkis> Duvdevan: you want ##php
[12:11:26] <Duvdevan> thanks
[12:11:37] <gp> Well I just had a simple idea that seems to have fixed my issue.  Is there anything to worry about if the "first page" is a dynamically created page that should never be shown again and I do $.mobile.path.isFirstPageUrl = function(){return false};
[12:12:28] <gp> Well I guess I could compare it against the data-url attr but same thing really
[12:13:46] <gp> Also, there isn't a more specific jquery mobile channel is there?  I haven't been able to find anywhere that is a users group for jqm\
[12:49:06] <aditya> hello, this side aditya. I am a novice. I basically need help about how to start contributing to projects on jquery. I have good knowledge about the required programming language. I would be greatfull if anyone can help :)
[13:49:46] <shoky_> http://contribute.jquery.org/
[13:53:19] <adavia> any idea how to build a pattern to match this http://regexr.com/3cpu8
[13:58:08] <jak2000> j j programming
[14:01:48] <shoky_> to match what?
[14:05:37] <adavia> i am trying something like http://regexr.com/3cpuk
[14:06:25] <arc_> we can't know what you're trying to pull out of there unless you tell us
[14:07:43] <adavia> arc_: anything in the brackets
[14:10:43] <shoky_> adavia if you want ^ or $ to work for multiple lines you need the 'm' flag
[14:11:30] <shoky_> anyways  /\[([^\[]+)\]/ should get anything inside the brackets
[14:12:48] <shoky_> http://regexr.com/3cpun  or maybe you wanted this  http://regexr.com/3cpuq
[14:13:37] <shoky_> oops that  ^\[  in the middle should be  ^\]
[14:13:50] <shoky_> so,  /\[([^\]]+)\]/
[14:13:55] <adavia> shoky_: in the last example i would just need to match attachments_attributes
[14:14:08] <adavia> plus 0 and file
[14:14:21] <adavia> guess that would be a mess
[14:16:12] <agustrong> Ok
[14:18:57] <shoky_> adavia /\[([^\]]+)\]/g  will get you those 3 groups
[14:19:58] <shoky_> adavia https://jsfiddle.net/antishok/mrpL666u/
[14:28:26] <adavia> shoky_: that works fine.. my doubt is if i have user[start_date(1i)] then wouldnt be better if i have something that matches the regex /user\[start_date\(?/ so that i can match strings with "start_date" or "start_date(1i)""
[14:30:27] <shoky_> adavia no idea what you mean
[14:33:02] <adavia> like what if i would like to match something like start_date(1i) or start_date inside the brackets
[14:34:36] <shoky_> still donno what you mean. it's something inside the brackets, like before. what's the difference here
[14:36:11] <adavia> its a pain to handle json errors form errors in rails
[14:36:24] <adavia> shoky_: nm that worked fine
[14:36:31] <adavia> thanks
[16:03:50] <noregret> how can I confirm browsing away from a page with filled form fields?
[16:10:55] <glowdemon1> Hey, don't know how to put this. But I've got one wrapper div, with several child divs, I click the 5th element but my script needs to know the number I clicked. Is there such function for that?
[16:21:19] <shoky_> glowdemon1: .index()
[16:24:28] <glowdemon1> Thanks shoky_
[16:25:06] <b4b> jquery rocks
[16:40:18] <Mark____> could anyone tell me why this plugin doesn’t function on my website? http://www.jqueryscript.net/demo/Creating-Chrome-style-Tabs-with-jQuery-jQuery-UI-Chrome-Tabs/
[16:43:27] <rogger_h> any spanish here?
[16:47:32] <itsio> hello, i am trying to learn basic webpage dev, i am stuck on this one thing, its related to Jquery, i must have gone blind from staring at the screen for so long because i cant find the simple problem, please can someone take a look at this code and tell me why 5 cent wont add to total? http://codepen.io/anon/pen/WrmNON?editors=1010
[17:01:15] <Bjerre> Hey guys. Any idea on how to get rid of the console error and display the source properly in an iframe? The error says: Refused to display 'theurl' in a frame because it set 'X-Frame-Options' to 'SAMEORIGIN'. Here is a jsfiddle: https://jsfiddle.net/Bjerre/qj8g2tLg/1/
[17:02:30] <snover> Bjerre: you can’t do what you are trying to do.
[17:02:41] <Bjerre> are you 100% sure snover?
[17:02:47] <snover> yes.
[17:02:48] <Bjerre> and if so, what is the reason for it?
[17:02:51] <snover> security.
[17:03:22] <Bjerre> I found a way to trick chrome to make it working but that needs extensions for it
[17:05:24] <Bjerre> so snover, how should I explain to my boss what the reason is? Just security that can't be bypassed or what?
[17:06:20] <snover> the site has a security policy set up to prevent clickjacking attacks, which means it cannot be embedded into another page, because that would open the site to clickjacking attacks.
[17:06:37] <Bjerre> ok thanks mate
[17:33:11] <snufft> hi guys
[17:34:05] <Mark____> could anyone tell me why this jquery plugin won’t work on my website? those tabs supposed to be draggable but it’s not working. what did i miss? http://lifeto.cafe24.com/xe/today
[17:34:37] <snufft> I've got a link that I need to attach an event to, but it looks like there's a preventDefault or something going on that's stopping my attachment. I can target its parent fine, but targeting the link itself results in nothing happening. can anyone tell me how I'd go about debugging this? I've tried using click(), mouseup() and mousedown()
[17:58:23] <Miles8of9> (function ($) {
[17:58:25] <Miles8of9>     $(this).on('keydown', function (e) {  <-- how can i make the event fire only on specific fields? at moment fires everytime everywhere
[18:02:57] <TuomasL> Miles8of9 instead of this have e.g. "input[type='text']" ?
[18:03:51] <Miles8of9> i need reusable code...  so i wrote a function
[18:04:45] <Miles8of9> i need it to fire only on fields i choose
[18:04:55] <TuomasL> ah, I see
[18:05:11] <TuomasL> so you want to feed the function whatever each case needs
[18:06:01] <Miles8of9> can i put the $(this).on inside the $.fn.?
[18:07:25] <Miles8of9> appears to be the correct way
[18:10:57] <Miles8of9> what's the difference between $(this) and this  ?
[18:42:03] <sonda> has anybody used CHAP timeline library/

[20:07:47] <shoky_> jak2000 they have an example. listen for shown.bs.tab  on the <a> elements
[20:20:12] <Mark____> could anyone take a look at this page and why the TAB functions are not working? http://lifeto.cafe24.com/xe/today
[20:30:39] <aaa> Hello
[20:53:32] <SteenJobs> hey guys, i’m using the isotope plugin and having trouble understanding the nature of the layout - there are options to set column sizing, but isn’t the whole objective to layout individual objects in a grid when they’re all sized differently?
[21:04:15] <SteenJobs> basically i’m trying to create a layout with images of different sizes
[22:14:03] <lonequid> I'm having some scope issues with a variable: https://jsfiddle.net/4ogoqcc4/ orderItems is defined outside of any function so it should be available globally, but the changes made to it inside the .each() are not reflected in the parent function
[22:45:36] <Mark____> i know im asking the same question,but can anyone tellme why the tab dragging and closing fuctions are not working on this page? http://lifeto.cafe24.com/xe/today
