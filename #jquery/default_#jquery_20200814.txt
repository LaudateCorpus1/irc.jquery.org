[00:32:19] <baruna> hi, sorry if this is a stupid question. I use $(this).closest('tr').remove() to remove the last table row dynamically. how I can remove two last table rows this way?
[05:35:49] <anli> Is tampermonkey built into chrome nowadays?
[11:30:10] <admin123> is there any good article on how to structure rich UIs? like I'm just toggling display: none for a complex form flow and I feel like its growing too complex
[14:56:49] <karaixx> hi. Can I load the html source of a remote web page?
[14:57:03] <robertmaxrees> karaixx yes and no.
[14:57:20] <karaixx> something like this: $( "#" ).load( "www.google.com", function() { }}
[14:57:36] <robertmaxrees> depends on the remote page.
[14:57:45] <robertmaxrees> make of them don't allow you to do that.
[14:57:51] <robertmaxrees> *many of them, rather.
[14:59:24] <robertmaxrees> karaixx why would you want to load the entirety of another web page like that?
[15:00:23] <karaixx> I am doing a greasemonkey script that relies on the information of another web page (something like pastebin) to add elements to a web page
[15:01:12] <robertmaxrees> hrm
[15:01:49] <robertmaxrees> yeah, depending on the remote resource, you might be blocked from doing that entirely.
[15:02:39] <karaixx> I see, in that case there are no alternatives right?
[15:02:52] <robertmaxrees> you cannot work around CORS without some kind of server-side proxy.
[15:03:16] <karaixx> that's too much of a mission for my use case
[15:03:40] <robertmaxrees> do you own/run this remote service?
[15:05:57] <robertmaxrees> because if so, you can set properly set CORS to allow that kind of behavior.
[15:06:05] <karaixx> no, te remote service is pastebin
[15:06:25] <karaixx> is a service similar to pastebin where you can write stuff
[15:06:49] <robertmaxrees> why would you want to fetch random markup from a service like that and inject it into a page?
[15:06:57] <karaixx> googledocs provides a rest api, but had problems while accessing it
[15:06:58] <robertmaxrees> sounds like a security vulnerability waiting to happen.
[15:07:39] <karaixx> To enrich the primary web site
[15:08:07] <robertmaxrees> yeah - sounds like a security vulnerability waiting to happen.  why not just put the markup you want inside the script itself?
[15:08:19] <karaixx> imagine my website is imdb and for each movie I want to add a text next to it indicating if it is on a list or not
[15:08:50] <karaixx> but the script will be shared among different people
[15:08:59] <karaixx> and that "pastebin" will be our collaborative list
[15:09:05] <robertmaxrees> so really you want to be able to serve a JSON or CSV file or something.
[15:09:16] <robertmaxrees> doesn't need to be HTML :)
[15:09:26] <karaixx> right!
[15:10:00] <karaixx> Will I be able to load a csv from a remote location?
[15:10:22] <robertmaxrees> any remote resources need to allow CORS.
[15:10:28] <robertmaxrees> regardless of file type.
[15:11:00] <karaixx> I see
[15:14:54] <inthl> assuming I set up an $.ajaxPrefilter ..now I want to look at the headers of the requests, which works fine with xhr.done, as this is being called once the request is completed
[15:15:14] <robertmaxrees> ok
[15:15:34] <inthl> but assuming that the request leads to a 302 redirect, and finally to a 200 - then I am seeing the headers of the 200 answer only, where all the 302 headers are not being reported
[15:15:59] <inthl> is there a way to trigger some callback function for both cases, so that I can read the headers while/before 302 was issued?
[15:16:38] <inthl> as .done() is being called only once the 200 request finished. xhr.progress() or something doesn't exist afaik
[15:16:56] <robertmaxrees> fwiw you want to use .then() instead of .done() these days.
[15:16:59] <robertmaxrees> but also: https://api.jquery.com/jquery.ajax/
[15:17:12] <robertmaxrees> check out the statusCode property :)
[15:18:45] <robertmaxrees> inthl
[15:19:04] <inthl> hm, interesting. thanks for the hint. but how would one put this into the ajaxprefilter?
[15:20:07] <robertmaxrees> dunno if you can.
[15:20:14] <robertmaxrees> since the prefilter is run once for the request.
[15:20:42] <robertmaxrees> (i'd also caution against no using prefilter for stuff like this :) )_
[15:20:52] <robertmaxrees> *against using prefilter, rather.
[15:22:13] <inthl> well my idea was to have this at one place, instead of writing callbacks in every ajax request for this, as my scenario has several use cases (apps, websites, interfaces, .. all with the same code) - and now I just wanted to report the headers, ajaxprefilter seems like a universal place for this
[15:23:10] <robertmaxrees> yeah, not really the right tool.   there are a ton of other ways you can manage ajax requests with defaults without using prefilter.
[15:23:16] <inthl> I was just wondering because the headers pre-200 are being dismissed, since .done does not care about 302 entirely
[15:23:26] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[15:23:30] <robertmaxrees> that's not what's happening :)
[15:23:47] <robertmaxrees> the .then() (and .done()) are getting called when the request finishes.
[15:24:18] <inthl> yes, but say one header has the same name, then its value will be the one from 200, I had no idea what it was before 302 was issued
[15:24:19] <robertmaxrees> so it's not necesssarily that it "doesn't care", it's that you can't call .then() (or .done()) more than once.
[15:24:47] <robertmaxrees> what header information would you need from the redirect?
[15:25:40] <inthl> something custom I am passing with headers, nothing common :>
[15:25:51] <robertmaxrees> sounds kind of strange.
[15:26:40] <inthl> welp okay, however, thanks for the help - luckily I can solve my issue with a workaround, I was just wondering whether this was possible at all in the prefilter. since you mentioned other tools, it may very well be possible that I have not heard about these, so what would that be?
[15:27:13] <robertmaxrees> statusCode
[15:27:38] <robertmaxrees> which is one of the props of the config object you give to $.ajax()
[15:27:45] <inthl> well this is again per-ajax-request instead of one common place for *any* ajax requests, isn't it?
[15:27:47] <inthl> yay
[15:27:53] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[15:27:59] <robertmaxrees> you can create a factory to generate it.
[15:28:14] <inthl> that's actually a good idea.
[15:28:28] <robertmaxrees> or create a "common" object that you can clone and then modify for specific requests.
[15:28:44] <inthl> thanks for the input, wouldn't have thought about that :>
[15:29:12] <robertmaxrees> sure.
[17:37:00] <baruna> hi, I'm learning jquery/experimenting.. https://jsfiddle.net/6bzpwy0r/1/ how come the first button is working but the second isn't? why $(this) doesn't work here? any idea?
[17:37:45] <robertmaxrees> well, for starters, don't use onclick :)
[17:38:00] <baruna> robertmaxrees: why not?
[17:38:16] <robertmaxrees> binding event listeners in html is weird.  use js to do it instead.
[17:39:50] <baruna> robertmaxrees: would that work dynamically as well? If I dynamically add a row with a button to add another button?
[17:40:05] <robertmaxrees> yes, you'd just use a delegated event listener instead.
[17:40:28] <robertmaxrees> https://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/ and https://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events tell you everything you need to know about that subject :)
[17:40:36] <baruna> robertmaxrees: tnx
[17:40:52] <robertmaxrees> sure.  feel free to ping the channel if you get stuck :)
[18:01:08] <baruna> robertmaxrees: however I have the same issue even when using event listeners - https://jsfiddle.net/6bzpwy0r/3/
[18:01:27] <robertmaxrees> because you're not using them correctly :)
[18:01:50] <baruna> well apparently
[18:03:08] <robertmaxrees> 2 things: 1 - when using 'this' in an event handler, don't wrap an anonymous function around it first.  just do $(document).on('click', '#second', AddRowAfterThis);
[18:03:19] <robertmaxrees> 2: i think you're confused about what .next() does :)
[18:04:11] <robertmaxrees> baruna
[18:04:51] <robertmaxrees> and actually, that first one works because you have a bug in your code :)
[18:05:34] <baruna> robertmaxrees: when I used  $(document).on('click','#first', AddRowAfterId("#first") ); the row was added just after document ready
[18:05:44] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[18:05:53] <robertmaxrees> oh, that's not how you do that.
[18:06:16] <robertmaxrees> when you pass in an argument, you'd wrap it, but that's a strange thing to do.
[18:06:35] <robertmaxrees> hence why I was specific about the case when you want to use 'this' :)
[18:06:45] <robertmaxrees> also: you're repeating id="first" - you can only use an ID once per page.
[18:08:17] <robertmaxrees> baruna so let's back up - what are you trying to accomplish with this?
[18:08:44] <baruna> robertmaxrees: well I want to add a row after clicking the button
[18:09:15] <baruna> and later add a row with a button to click a row as well
[18:10:08] <robertmaxrees> 1 sec and i'll show you what to do :)
[18:10:24] <baruna> when you told me not to user anonymous function didn't you mean to use  $(document).on('click','#first', AddRowAfterId("#first row") ); ?
[18:10:32] <kof> robertmaxrees hai
[18:10:34] <robertmaxrees> no, i did not. :) 1 sec.
[18:11:06] <kof> https://sorrynosympathy.com/ here menu link not working on some mobile but on the demo  https://vice.qantumthemes.xyz/dhrk/   works
[18:11:21] <kof> cant see any error on console
[18:15:07] <robertmaxrees> back
[18:15:12] <baruna> kof: I'm not wondering it's not working on some mobiles since my browser on laptop nearly crashed on the website
[18:15:16] <robertmaxrees> kof please ask trhe channel, not me specifically.
[18:15:21] <robertmaxrees> kof and make an isolated test case
[18:15:22] <robertmaxrees> baruna
[18:15:43] <baruna> kof: the page probably uses too many resources
[18:16:06] <robertmaxrees> so baruna - you can't pass args in when using $(document).on('click', '#second', AddRowAfterThis); - notice how there are no parens.
[18:16:24] <robertmaxrees> so let's get this one example working before we tackle that other one.
[18:16:30] <robertmaxrees> baruna do you understand what .next() does?
[18:16:41] <robertmaxrees> (ie explain to me what you think it does :) )
[18:17:03] <baruna> robertmaxrees: it should get the next sibling, something like this
[18:17:23] <robertmaxrees> yes.  so if 'this' is the button, what 'sibling' would it have to go to?
[18:17:53] <baruna> robertmaxrees: ah I thought 'this' is the 'td' tag it's in
[18:18:25] <robertmaxrees> why would it be the td if you're selecting the button? :)
[18:18:52] <baruna> so in this case 'td' is parent and 'tr' is parent of parent?
[18:19:06] <robertmaxrees> yes, but there's an easier way to select the tr :)
[18:19:29] <robertmaxrees> $(this).closest('tr') - closest starts at the current element and then goes through all ancestors until it finds the element that matches.
[18:20:06] <baruna> robertmaxrees: cool!
[18:22:13] <baruna> robertmaxrees: I have it working, thank you!
[18:22:19] <robertmaxrees> sure!
[18:22:58] <robertmaxrees> kof also: that menu button works.
[18:23:02] <robertmaxrees> soooo...
[18:23:42] <kof> robertmaxrees which device is that?
[18:23:52] <robertmaxrees> chrome in mobile emulation mode.
[18:24:04] <robertmaxrees> if it's not working for you for a particular device, be more specific.
[18:24:07] <kof> I have checked it too works
[18:24:21] <robertmaxrees> ..
[18:24:25] <robertmaxrees> you just said it didn't work.
[18:24:28] <robertmaxrees> so which is it?
[18:24:45] <kof> My client said some devices doesnt work galaxy note 9, whatever the newest iphone is, iphone se, and some other new android
[18:26:35] <robertmaxrees> so wait - you got a bug report you couldn't replicate, and your first instinct was to come in here and ask why it's broken?
[18:26:58] <robertmaxrees> so you don't even know if it's a jquery issue in the first place.
[18:27:53] <kof> yes
[18:28:12] <robertmaxrees> this is a jquery support channel.  not a general-purpose dev support playground :/
[18:29:05] <kof> I thought its any jQuery click event issue
[18:29:06] <robertmaxrees> like, occasional off-topic stuff is whatever, but you're basically asking people to do free work for you :/
[18:29:19] <robertmaxrees> what evidence do you have to support that idea?
[18:29:32] <robertmaxrees> have you considered reaching out to whoever made the theme and asking for support from them?
[18:30:12] <kof> No both are same theme
[18:30:25] <BlackSalmon> https://dpaste.org/hJLi Why it's duplicating what's inside #rep-pos-form?
[18:30:40] <robertmaxrees> kof who made the theme?
[18:31:07] <robertmaxrees> BlackSalmon because that's what you're selecting?
[18:31:20] <kof> quantumthemes
[18:31:21] <BlackSalmon> How can i just overwrite or something?
[18:31:42] <kof> https://qantumthemes.com/
[18:31:43] <robertmaxrees> BlackSalmon empty it first.
[18:31:47] <robertmaxrees> kof so reach out to them.
[18:32:24] <BlackSalmon> robertmaxrees: it duplicates anyway
[18:32:31] <robertmaxrees> BlackSalmon show me.
[18:32:38] <robertmaxrees> BlackSalmon the actual code you're using.
[18:32:48] <BlackSalmon> `$("#rep-pos-form").empty().load(document.URL + " #rep-pos-form > *");`
[18:33:49] <robertmaxrees> try doing that as two lines.
[18:34:08] <robertmaxrees> $("#rep-pos-form").empty(); then $("#rep-pos-form").load(document.URL + " #rep-pos-form > *");
[18:34:20] <robertmaxrees> tho tbh that's a really weird way to do that in the first place :)
[18:34:35] <robertmaxrees> incuring a ton of overhead for just a single div.
[18:35:07] <BlackSalmon> what you mean by overhead
[18:35:29] <BlackSalmon> w8, just bad translation
[18:35:33] <BlackSalmon> my bad
[18:36:24] <robertmaxrees> just make an api endpoint that has the data in JSON and re-render that instead.
[18:38:40] <BlackSalmon> i made that div in which #rep-pos-form is nested is "reloaded" and it works
[18:38:52] <robertmaxrees> :/
[18:39:08] <BlackSalmon> Looks sketchy but works :/
[18:39:23] <robertmaxrees> i'd start on your V2 now and do it the right way :)
[18:39:33] <robertmaxrees> should be super straightforward, to boot.
[18:40:14] <BlackSalmon> Not really have willingness to play with js
[18:40:20] <robertmaxrees> lol
[18:40:29] <BlackSalmon> I need that only for some ajax reloads
[18:40:42] <robertmaxrees> good luck with those later bug reports lol
[18:40:46] <BlackSalmon> :D
[18:41:19] <robertmaxrees> how many elements are you doing this with?>
[18:41:28] <BlackSalmon> `$(".plus_and_counting").empty().load(document.URL + " .plus_and_counting > *");`
[18:41:45] <robertmaxrees> >.>
[18:41:46] <BlackSalmon> you mean doing with ajax or this
[18:41:53] <robertmaxrees> that's using ajax.
[18:42:05] <robertmaxrees> .load() is just a wrapper for $.ajax().
[18:42:26] <robertmaxrees> so any ajax call that's loading the document.url agaon.
[18:42:29] <robertmaxrees> *again
[18:43:48] <BlackSalmon> only that specific ajax call
[18:44:20] <robertmaxrees> thought the other example had a differenct selector?
[18:44:32] <BlackSalmon> https://dpaste.org/paso
[18:44:37] <robertmaxrees> either way - just be prepared for the server load since each refresh will be for the entire page, not just that data.
[18:45:50] <BlackSalmon> location.href is any different than document.URL?
[18:46:27] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Location/href
[18:46:30] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/URL
[18:46:35] <robertmaxrees> you read and tell me :)
[18:47:56] <BlackSalmon> I can update location.href but not document.URL
[18:47:59] <BlackSalmon> ye?
[18:48:04] <robertmaxrees> lol
[18:48:15] <BlackSalmon> That's what i read xD
[18:48:25] <robertmaxrees> what are you actually trying to accomplish?
[18:48:50] <BlackSalmon> i have backend in django that is adding
[18:49:13] <robertmaxrees> asking generic questions like "what's different between these two things?" is rarely helpful.  saying "i would like to accomplish x task, i think I should use y to do it.  is there a better way?"
[18:49:21] <robertmaxrees> that latter example is MUCH better.
[18:49:38] <BlackSalmon> ..adding/removing class inside submit button inside #rep-pos-form and i need to refresh this div
[18:49:56] <robertmaxrees> I thought you said it was all working correctly?
[18:50:15] <BlackSalmon> i thought tho it's doubled too
[18:50:33] <robertmaxrees> :shrug: without seeing the bug in action it's really had to troubleshoot.
[18:50:59] <BlackSalmon> it's maybe some issue with my backend that causes this
[18:51:09] <BlackSalmon> may be(
[18:51:10] <BlackSalmon> *
[18:51:24] <robertmaxrees> or your js is doing something unusual.
[18:51:39] <robertmaxrees> big part of why doing things this way is a bad idea :)
[18:53:30] <robertmaxrees> and actually, if you're using django, it should be pretty straightforward to just expose the data you need.  client-side rendering for most of this would be pretty easy, too.
[18:53:59] <robertmaxrees> since you're doing this inside an ajax call already, you can just make it part of the server response.  ezpz.
[18:54:17] <BlackSalmon> that's why i am not really into playing with js, if i mess something in django i just know that i need to look there. But if i am doing something in both at the same time i'm not sure what let me down
[18:54:34] <robertmaxrees> pretty easy to figure it out honestly.
[18:54:47] <robertmaxrees> let django pump out data, let js handle rending that into the page.
[18:55:03] <robertmaxrees> if the data is wrong, it's django.  if it's rendered wrong, it's the js :)
[18:59:03] <BlackSalmon> k
[19:49:57] <baruna> let's say I have several tr classes. How can I find the closest tr class? $(this).closest ('tr .class') doesnt work, not ever $(this).closest ('tr_class_name')...
[19:50:11] <baruna> any idea?
[19:52:00] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[19:52:18] <robertmaxrees> 'tr .class' is going to look for al element with .class under <tr>
[19:52:32] <robertmaxrees> baruna also, deifne "closest".
[19:57:28] <baruna> robertmaxrees: I'm sorry, I just got tangled somehow
[19:57:56] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[19:59:26] <baruna> I want to find the last tr .class and append something behind it
[19:59:37] <robertmaxrees> "behind"?
[19:59:40] <robertmaxrees> you mean "after"?
[20:00:08] <baruna> $(this).last('tr .class').after(text)
[20:00:18] <robertmaxrees> so again
[20:00:19] <baruna> but this doesn't work
[20:00:28] <robertmaxrees> 'tr .class' is going to look for al element with .class under <tr>
[20:00:36] <robertmaxrees> you want tr.class or just .class
[20:01:09] <baruna> I want the last 'tr .class'
[20:01:28] <robertmaxrees> ...
[20:01:35] <robertmaxrees> make a fiddle.
[20:01:52] <baruna> hm wait a minute
[20:01:53] <robertmaxrees> because you keep repeating yourself and i'm confused.
[20:08:15] <baruna> robertmaxrees: https://jsfiddle.net/ojxma36g/ let's say now I want to add a row after the last green row
[20:08:32] <baruna> upon clicking the button
[20:08:58] <robertmaxrees> huh?  that code doesn't make any sense.  what's 'id' in that function?
[20:09:54] <robertmaxrees> or is that what you're trying to replace?
[20:10:03] <baruna> that's a leftover from the last fiddle. https://jsfiddle.net/ojxma36g/1/ better
[20:10:17] <baruna> I would expect something like this $("tr .green").last().after
[20:10:21] <robertmaxrees> ...
[20:10:44] <robertmaxrees> so like I said earlier, 'tr .green' is trying to select elements with the class 'green' within <tr>
[20:10:53] <robertmaxrees> tr.green is what you want instead.
[20:10:55] <robertmaxrees> no space.
[20:11:29] <baruna> ah.. what a stupid error :) tnx
[20:11:41] <robertmaxrees> generally, however, you want to avoid prepending tagnames onto selectors like that.
[20:12:13] <baruna> robertmaxrees: what do you mean?
[20:12:18] <robertmaxrees> just use .green
[20:12:21] <robertmaxrees> instead of tr.green
[20:12:55] <baruna> ah that works too.
[21:52:21] <robertparkerx> How can I .append a response to a container but have it slide down. I can show a example on my staging. http://staging.exactprecisions.com/blog/ the blog 'load more'. The response will .append but I'm at the same location of the button. The button doesn't slide down when it is added for instance.
[21:55:29] <robertmaxrees> robertparkerx not sure i follow.  what's the specific bug?
[21:55:39] <robertmaxrees> and how do I replicate it?
[21:55:58] <robertparkerx> press 'load more' on the staging. You should see what I mean.
[21:56:04] <robertparkerx> I'm not good at explaining :(
[21:56:10] <robertmaxrees> and then it loads the articles.
[21:56:14] <robertmaxrees> what should happen instead?
[21:56:38] <robertparkerx> like I be at the same position but the loaded articles push down and the button too
[21:56:56] <robertparkerx> I'm just using .append right now
[21:56:56] <robertmaxrees> can you paste the code you're using somewhere?
[21:56:59] <robertparkerx> yes
[21:57:26] <robertparkerx> robertmaxrees https://url.hashdev.org/22
[21:58:09] <robertmaxrees> ooooh, you're asking how to do that effect.
[21:58:21] <robertparkerx> I thought it would do it by default
[21:58:21] <robertmaxrees> not saying it isn't working coirrectly or whatever
[21:58:24] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[21:58:28] <robertmaxrees> append just appends things.
[21:58:36] <robertmaxrees> doesn't do anything special.
[21:59:09] <robertparkerx> I probably should have made a fiddle
[21:59:33] <robertmaxrees> :) either way, you'll have to load the content in and then animate it manually.
[21:59:56] <robertparkerx> how can I keep my position?
[22:00:07] <robertmaxrees> not sure i follow.
[22:00:13] <robertparkerx> well I mean the position I'm at when I first click
[22:00:16] <robertmaxrees> what does position have to do with anything?
[22:00:37] <robertparkerx> I feel like I'm moved down with the append
[22:00:45] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[22:00:48] <robertmaxrees> not happening here.
[22:01:04] <robertmaxrees> i click the button and the content gets expanded, but the viewport's in the same spot.
[22:01:10] <robertparkerx> yes
[22:01:13] <robertparkerx> that's what I mean
[22:01:15] <robertmaxrees> >.>
[22:01:22] <robertmaxrees> so then what position are you talking about?
[22:02:14] <robertparkerx> I just want to append to load the articles and I be at the same position I was when I first clicked but the articles and button list down (or pushed down)
[22:02:28] <robertmaxrees> yeah, you can do that.
[22:02:39] <robertmaxrees> a few different ways.
[22:03:01] <robertmaxrees> load the content into a div with 0 height, then animate the height to whatever it needs to be.
[22:03:03] <robertmaxrees> that's one way.
[22:07:30] <robertparkerx> can I save the position I'm at when I first click or its position from the top and the animate it back up ? or is that stupid?
[22:07:50] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[22:07:52] <robertmaxrees> lol
[22:07:54] <robertparkerx> haha
[22:07:59] <robertmaxrees> i'm really confused about why you keep asking about position.
[22:08:22] <robertmaxrees> like, you just animate the vertical height.  are you afraid the viewport will move with it?
[22:08:24] <robertparkerx> is it page scroll position?
[22:08:50] <robertmaxrees> are you trying to modify where the user is scrolled to?
[22:09:13] <robertparkerx> not modify but save it on click event and then when it is append go back to that position
[22:09:21] <robertparkerx> or is that stupid
[22:09:23] <robertmaxrees> why?
[22:09:32] <robertmaxrees> the browser viewport won't move unless you make it.
[22:09:39] <robertmaxrees> so where are you taking the user "back to"?
[22:09:51] <robertparkerx> the last article before load more for instance
[22:10:09] <robertparkerx> well before load more was clicked
[22:10:19] <robertmaxrees> so like, user clicks "load more" or w/e, then you do a slidedown animation and that shows the new content, right?
[22:10:37] <robertparkerx> Well that's what I wanted originally yeah
[22:10:46] <robertmaxrees> right, so where does position come into play?
[22:10:57] <robertparkerx> I thought it did
[22:10:57] <robertmaxrees> the viewport stays in place.  nothing moves.
[22:11:26] <robertmaxrees> are you wondering if you should scroll the browser down for the user?
[22:12:20] <robertparkerx> no I really don't want to go to the bottom
[22:12:34] <robertmaxrees> so confused lol.
[22:12:36] <robertparkerx> I'm staying at the bottom now without anything
[22:12:44] <robertparkerx> I'm sorry robertmaxrees
[22:12:58] <robertmaxrees> when i click "load more", the page doesn't move.
[22:13:02] <robertmaxrees> the new content appears.
[22:13:31] <robertmaxrees> are you afraid adding the animation will cause the browser to scroll?
[22:13:38] <robertparkerx> yes
[22:13:42] <robertmaxrees> it will not.
[22:13:50] <robertmaxrees> the browser will only scroll if you make it.
[22:14:29] <robertmaxrees> just animating that element will not cause it to scroll.
[22:14:34] <robertmaxrees> so you don't need to worry about that.
[22:15:01] <robertparkerx> Let me try
[22:20:03] <robertparkerx> I did it!
[22:20:08] <robertparkerx> Not animate but I did it
[22:20:14] <robertmaxrees> ??
[22:20:19] <robertparkerx> robertmaxrees http://staging.exactprecisions.com/blog/
[22:20:27] <robertparkerx> this is what I meant
[22:20:33] <robertmaxrees> it's doing the same thing?
[22:20:37] <robertparkerx> no
[22:20:43] <robertmaxrees> what's different??
[22:20:44] <robertparkerx> it's not in the same position
[22:20:48] <robertparkerx> haha
[22:20:59] <robertmaxrees> it's literally behaving the exact same way for me.
[22:21:05] <robertparkerx> I saved the scrollTop()
[22:21:13] <robertparkerx> ctrl+f5
[22:21:21] <robertmaxrees> i tried a new browser window even.
[22:21:25] <robertmaxrees> *different browser.
[22:21:41] <robertmaxrees> i press the button, the viewport stays in the same place, new content loads.
[22:21:48] <robertmaxrees> same exact thing as before.
[22:21:53] <robertparkerx> yes but it pushed down now
[22:22:03] <robertmaxrees> pushed what down?
[22:22:16] <robertparkerx> the articles load downwards
[22:22:25] <robertmaxrees> it was doing that before for me.
[22:22:32] <robertparkerx> It wasn't for me
[22:23:37] <robertmaxrees> O.o
[22:23:41] <robertparkerx> haha
[22:24:05] <robertparkerx> I'm going to try animate now because I think it will look better and modern
[22:24:13] <robertmaxrees> mind sharing the new code?
[22:24:17] <robertparkerx> yes
[22:24:41] <robertparkerx> https://url.hashdev.org/23
[22:25:21] <robertmaxrees> then you have something else going on.
[22:25:29] <robertmaxrees> your code shouldn't cause the page to scroll.
[22:25:58] <robertparkerx> hmm
[22:27:45] <robertmaxrees> you said the viewport was automatically moving when you appended the new content?
[22:28:13] <robertparkerx> the articles were loaded but I was still at the button position
[22:28:35] <robertparkerx> I can comment it out and show the difference maybe
[22:28:44] <robertparkerx> I have to compile
[22:28:53] <robertmaxrees> so the viewport scrolled when you clicked the button?
[22:28:57] <robertparkerx> no
[22:29:10] <robertmaxrees> haha
[22:29:35] <robertparkerx> haha
[22:29:46] <robertparkerx> I'm sorry
[22:30:02] <robertmaxrees> i'm just really unclear about the issue.  i press the button, content loads, nothing scrolled or moved or whatever.
[22:30:18] <robertmaxrees> just new content came in.  then I see this change and it's the same functionality.
[22:30:30] <robertmaxrees> which is browser default behavior,.
[22:30:30] <robertparkerx> it shouldn't be though
[22:30:36] <robertparkerx> it pushes the content down now for me
[22:31:33] <robertmaxrees> :/ dunno what you mean by "push" or "content" in this case haha
[22:31:40] <robertmaxrees> but alrighty :) whatever works.
[22:37:00] <robertmaxrees> so wait - https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/j6sgth3f/
[22:37:30] <robertmaxrees> does this not work correctly for you?
[22:37:42] <robertparkerx> no but at one time I thought it did!!!!
[22:38:00] <robertparkerx> wait
[22:38:06] <robertparkerx> scroll all the way down and click it
[22:38:13] <robertmaxrees> yeah.
[22:38:14] <robertparkerx> click it until the button is at the bottom
[22:38:17] <robertmaxrees> yeah.
[22:38:19] <robertparkerx> it stays in that position
[22:38:39] <robertmaxrees> what stays in what position?
[22:38:50] <robertmaxrees> i click the button, new content comes in, button gets pushed down./
[22:39:02] <robertparkerx> the button will stay in that position if you scroll down
[22:39:07] <robertparkerx> and click it again
[22:39:09] <robertmaxrees> scroll again, rinse, repeat.
[22:39:18] <robertparkerx> doesn't do it for me
[22:39:35] <robertmaxrees> so confused lol
[22:39:50] <robertparkerx> https://i.hashdev.org/20200814_213952_ROBERTPARKERX.jpg
[22:40:10] <robertparkerx> if I click it again the button is in the same position, it doesn't get pushed down anymore
[22:40:20] <robertparkerx> the new content is loaded above
[22:40:26] <robertmaxrees> what browser are you in?
[22:40:30] <robertparkerx> Chrome
[22:40:42] <robertparkerx> The one before the latest, I haven't upgraded yet
[22:40:49] <robertmaxrees> oooooooooooooooooooooooohhhhhhhhh
[22:42:31] <robertmaxrees> that's terrible functionality holy cripes.
[22:42:59] <robertmaxrees> fwiw - it's doing the exact same thing, but it's auto-scrolling you.
[22:43:32] <robertparkerx> I swear it was working how you had it for me at first without anything extra
[22:44:03] <robertparkerx> It stopped
[22:44:03] <robertmaxrees> it may be that chrome somehow "registered" that it should use that behavior.
[22:44:30] <robertmaxrees> the "technically" correct fix for that is https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/j6sgth3f/7/
[22:44:39] <robertmaxrees> overflow-anchor: none; on whatever the scrolling element is.
[22:45:02] <robertparkerx> okay this works
[22:45:20] <robertmaxrees> chrome's gotta get their act together yeesh.
