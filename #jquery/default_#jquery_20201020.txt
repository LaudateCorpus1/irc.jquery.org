[07:25:07] <Alex35> thanx
[12:18:03] <dimi1947> can not() work with arrays?
[12:18:46] <dimi1947> or it works inly with elements?
[12:28:23] <Northwoods> How do i animate an image before load of html ( more like a pre-loader ) thing
[12:30:58] <robertmaxrees> dimi1947 https://api.jquery.com/not/ ;)
[12:31:24] <robertmaxrees> Northwoods you mean like a loading spinmner kinmd of thing?
[12:31:29] <robertmaxrees> *spinner
[12:32:24] <dimi1947> thanks...that is the obvious answer...I am just extremely tired and the obvious did not cross my mind
[12:32:27] <dimi1947> sorry
[12:32:34] <robertmaxrees> :) all good.
[12:33:38] <Northwoods> robertmaxrees, yes
[12:34:03] <Northwoods> instead of spinner it will be a image with fade in affect
[12:34:04] <robertmaxrees> Northwoods there are a few ways, though those are kind of... counterproductive.
[12:34:14] <robertmaxrees> "fade in effect"?
[12:34:24] <robertmaxrees> you mean like a low-res version and then the full res version?
[12:34:28] <Northwoods> no
[12:34:31] <robertmaxrees> hrm.
[12:34:37] <Northwoods> forget about effect
[12:34:49] <Northwoods> just simple showing of an image before loading of rest of page
[12:34:58] <robertmaxrees> that's not really a good idea fwiw.
[12:36:56] <robertmaxrees> you'd basically render a div with a centered image over the entire pager.
[12:36:58] <robertmaxrees> *page
[12:37:11] <robertmaxrees> then on $(window).on('load', function() {}); you hide it.
[12:37:20] <robertmaxrees> but that won't catch ALL assets, just the ones directly linked in the document.
[12:38:32] <Northwoods> interestingly there isn't a css solution for this on stackoverflow
[12:38:50] <robertmaxrees> well yeah.  CSS isn't aware of when things load.
[12:39:54] <robertmaxrees> most folks avoid those kinds of UIs anyway.
[12:50:06] <robertparkerx> https://url.hashdev.org/3e I was trying to hide a bubble once 150px away from bottom. It was working or so I thought but it does nothing now. the selectors are right.
[12:51:40] <robertmaxrees> how did you validate the selectors?
[12:52:00] <robertparkerx> Well I mean the variables
[12:52:06] <robertparkerx> I'm not sure about the conditions
[12:52:17] <robertmaxrees> also: is the page's markup valid?  certain mistakes can cause doc ready to fire early.
[12:52:29] <robertparkerx> probably not
[12:52:35] <robertmaxrees> so then validate all that :)
[13:01:48] <robertparkerx> I figured out what it was
[13:01:56] <robertmaxrees> what was it?
[13:01:57] <robertparkerx> I should have used + 200 instead of - 200
[13:02:01] <robertmaxrees> :)
[13:02:21] <robertmaxrees> also: "cache" $(window) before the scroll handler and then use the stored version.
[13:02:58] <robertparkerx> how do I do that
[13:03:06] <robertmaxrees> var $window = $(window);
[13:03:13] <robertmaxrees> then use $window in the scoll handler.
[13:03:44] <robertparkerx> ty
[13:04:31] <robertmaxrees> if you wind up doing anything more intensive than that, you'll want to look into debouncing or throttling that handler, as well, since scroll events are one of the rare occasions where logic can fire many times a second and slow things down.
[13:07:34] <robertparkerx> I have to read about what that means
[13:07:36] <robertparkerx> :)
[13:07:54] <robertparkerx> the caching worked great
[13:08:10] <robertmaxrees> "debounce" means "don't run the handler until after the event has stopped".  "throttle" means "fire the handler less often"
[13:08:24] <robertparkerx> ok
[13:16:40] <robertparkerx> debounce sounds confusing. when would you need to do it? can you give a small example?
[13:17:18] <robertmaxrees> it's particularly useful on resize or scroll - just sort of depends on what the handler is doing.
[15:06:06] <linux_daemon> hello everyone, does anyone know what player does this page use to play the videos? https://www.peugeot.co.uk/210-years/
[15:07:19] <robertmaxrees> should be pretty easy to inspect source and poke around.
[15:08:04] <linux_daemon> just found js-video-player tags and thats it
[15:08:26] <robertmaxrees> it's in an iframe
[15:08:27] <robertmaxrees> https://210ans-peugeot.fr/
[15:08:37] <robertmaxrees> ^ so you'll want to dig around on this :)
[15:09:38] <linux_daemon> where do you see the iframe? there is only 1 iframe, i am talking about the videos bellow it
[15:09:54] <robertmaxrees> can you please be more specific with which videos you're talking about then?
[15:10:23] <robertmaxrees> do you mean ones like https://i.imgur.com/WbrXhvc.png ?
[15:10:29] <linux_daemon> for example, the video bellow, at the Armand PEUGEOT section
[15:10:38] <linux_daemon> yep
[15:11:47] <robertmaxrees> so one strategy is to find a class or data attribute that looks weird and plug that into google and see what comes up.  i noticed one called plyr__video-wrapper - take a look at that one.
[15:12:58] <linux_daemon> this comes up when it is called: https://plyr.io/
[15:13:08] <linux_daemon> i mean, when you search for it
[15:13:42] <linux_daemon> yeah, thats the one
[15:14:34] <linux_daemon> now just to find the real sources of the videos, that would be great
[15:14:46] <linux_daemon> all i see is cdn links
[15:18:27] <robertmaxrees> sorry about that.
[15:21:30] <robertmaxrees> linux_daemon whatcha mean "the real sources of the videos"?  can you be clearer about what you're trying to accomplish?
[15:28:45] <linux_daemon> the videos are read from cdn, if you inspect the div
[15:29:00] <robertmaxrees> lol i know how video hosting works :)
[15:29:24] <robertmaxrees> are you trying to video out who the host is?
[15:30:22] <linux_daemon> if by that, you mean: do you want to download the videos, then yes
[15:30:23] <robertmaxrees> *figure out, rather
[15:30:29] <robertmaxrees> aaaah.
[15:31:35] <robertmaxrees> so you'll see a <video> tag - beneath that you'll find two "source" tags, one for H.264 HLS and the other for H.264 mp4
[15:31:45] <robertmaxrees> so pick one, go to the URL, and save it.
[15:33:32] <robertmaxrees> if you're looking for more assistance on this, I might try a channel on html or general web stuff.
[15:34:10] <linux_daemon> this is great insight, thanx robertmaxrees :)
[15:35:27] <robertmaxrees> sure.
