[00:02:37] <edoop> :)
[00:02:49] <duch_kazatel> edoop that.., doesn't make any sense.
[00:03:27] <edoop> why ?
[00:03:28] <duch_kazatel> the_last http://jsfiddle.net/YcxHs/
[00:03:43] <duch_kazatel> edoop the sentence itself is poorly stuctured.
[00:03:48] <edoop> group  hasn't mine
[00:04:11] <duch_kazatel> edoop you mean that you want to get all the posts of a group that isn't yours?
[00:04:48] <edoop> yes  but it is public

[00:05:05] <edoop> i can show  the post without subscription
[00:05:07] <duch_kazatel> there you go.
[00:05:21] <the_last> duch_kazatel: hmmm, my codes too complicated to make a simple thing out of :( but obviously it works given your example, soooo
[00:05:27] <the_last> i must be doing something wrong haha
[00:05:34] <edoop> :)
[00:05:36] <duch_kazatel> edoop search google with what I just gave you.
[00:05:45] <edoop> you using a trigger to get google
[00:05:46] <edoop> :)
[00:06:19] <duch_kazatel> edoop a bot ;)  the bot's history doesn't have the right context.  go to google yourself and read.  shouldn't be too hard.
[00:06:25] <edoop> duch ok thank you , i will try
[00:06:27] <edoop> :)
[00:06:40] <duch_kazatel> the_last .parents() only applies to ancestors.  make sure your document is valid, too.
[00:06:50] <edoop> i have another ask relation you '#thetarget').parents('.comment')  jsfiddle example
[00:07:01] <duch_kazatel> edoop that was meant for the_last
[00:07:23] <edoop> yes but i was curious  and i open the link
[00:07:34] <duch_kazatel> okay, what's the question?
[00:08:41] <the_last> duch_kazatel: figured it out :) i was using siblings instead of find
[00:08:42] <edoop> having experience  in actionscript i have   frequently used  _parent and _self to get the path level  of an object linked
[00:08:45] <the_last> and i think it was looking in the wrong place
[00:08:48] <the_last> duch_kazatel: thanks for your help
[00:08:58] <duch_kazatel> the_last there you go :)
[00:09:14] <duch_kazatel> edoop actionscript and javascript are similar, but not the same.
[00:09:27] <edoop> the hierarchy
[00:09:29] <duch_kazatel> edoop and actionscript and jquery are very different.
[00:09:51] <duch_kazatel> do not confuse them.
[00:10:00] <duch_kazatel> and with that, i go.  laptop is about to shut off.
[00:10:03] <duch_kazatel> enjoy folks.
[00:10:27] <edoop> I was to think if he meant more or less this or if there were possibility to nest in that way objects in an internship
[00:11:04] <edoop> .parents('.comment')
[00:11:21] <edoop> (#thetarget').parents('.comment')
[00:22:45] <LoneStar99> why would line 24 not work in the following code -> http://pastebin.com/KWigYJuK
[00:23:02] <LoneStar99> does the click lose focus?
[01:09:28] <makingsite> is reveal.js javascript or jquery?
[01:17:34] <_rgn> makingsite: how about checking the project page or reading the source?
[01:18:49] <makingsite> _rgn im new i dont really know how to read it yet
[01:19:26] <_rgn> hmm. why do you want to know if it uses jquery?
[01:21:48] <makingsite> trying to understand what does what
[01:22:23] <makingsite> if it uses jquery, then i learn jquery, like that pretty much
[01:22:48] <makingsite> _rgn
[01:23:28] <_rgn> you need to understand javascript in any case
[01:24:37] <makingsite> well basically how do i use reveal.js -- do i need to konw js to use it? or...?
[01:32:02] <_rgn> most likely it would be useful
[02:26:31] <Dirkos> How can i get the index from a list of input fields: name="myfield[12][value]"

[03:53:39] <gnu_d> hi, what can cause borders on an img element located in a listview, using JQM ? I tried looking all the css classes, and I wasn't able to locate the issue, this happens on WebKit base browsers only.
[03:53:53] <gnu_d> based
[04:13:19] <Taggnostr2> is there something like Python's zip() function in jquery?
[04:14:22] <Taggnostr2> it should do something like: zip(['a', 'b', 'c'], [1, 2, 3]) == [['a', 1] , ['b', 2], ['c', 3]]
[05:18:54] <mayerbci> does anybody know why when using the back button radio buttons do not retain their value? also when using safari to test when using any back button the page draws fine but then the page load time keeps going till about a minute

[07:30:56] <StephenS> dwarder ha?
[07:31:03] <dwarder> StephenS: ?

[07:33:03] <Happzz> $('form#newMemo div.form-group').each().addClass('has-success');
[07:33:06] <Happzz> why is this wrong?
[07:33:14] <Happzz> (the each part is wrong for some reason)
[07:34:24] <Uhkis> ?api each
[07:34:24] <b-ot> Uhkis: .each(): Iterate over a jQuery object, executing a function for each matched element.  http://api.jquery.com/each/
[07:35:47] <Happzz> well im missing something, looks like im not after each() at all
[07:35:54] <Happzz> $('form#newMemo div.form-group').addClass('has-success').find("span.glyphicon").first().addClass("glyphicon-ok");
[07:35:57] <Happzz> this is the whole line
[07:36:07] <Happzz> page has N div.form-group matches
[07:36:17] <Happzz> each has a span.glyphicon in it
[07:36:40] <Happzz> the first addclass() is processed fine for all divs, but the second addclass doesn't.
[07:39:18] <Uhkis> put it on 2 lines?
[07:41:44] <z3l> Hello
[07:42:31] <z3l> http://pastebin.com/4nw6m1p9 I have something like this. How can I add onclick event to each img inside .slide ?
[07:42:52] <z3l> I dont ask about the code, just a method to look for in the manual.
[07:43:39] <Uhkis> z3l: meybe each? :D
[07:44:19] <LoneStar99> z3l: $(document).on('click', '.os-container', function(){ ... });
[07:44:28] <z3l> Thank you guys.
[07:44:54] <LoneStar99> z3l: $(this).closest('.os-container').children('.os-v').text();
[07:45:31] <z3l> LoneStar99: I would have a lot of classes, called slide.
[07:45:41] <LoneStar99> z3l: try something like this -> http://jsfiddle.net/EVwM7/1/
[07:45:43] <z3l> Will closest get the actual parent?
[07:46:02] <Uhkis> parent() is for getting parents
[07:46:42] <z3l> mhm, let me try that. Thank's.
[07:46:52] <LoneStar99> z3l: it will get children
[07:47:30] <LoneStar99> but that code above should take you in the right direction
[07:54:54] <z3l> LoneStar99: Works like a charm, thank you.
[07:55:05] <z3l> $(this).closest('.slide').children('.main_photo').attr('src', $(this).attr('src').replace('_thumb', ''));
[07:55:14] <z3l> and I can swap images :)
[07:58:02] <LoneStar99> z3l:  awesome am working on the same code but alittle different application
[08:04:31] <z3l> LoneStar99: Mhm, there is something wrong with this.
[08:30:06] <Guest4525> Hello, I got a problem when using jquery datepicker and beforeShowDay. I do get the error "TypeError: beforeShowDay.apply is not a function" in line 1721 of jquery.ui.datepicker.js.
[08:30:59] <Guest4525> The line of code looks like that: daySettings = (beforeShowDay ? beforeShowDay.apply((inst.input ? inst.input[0] : null), [printDate]) : [true, ""]);
[08:33:32] <rioch> In a click event, can I refer to the element where the click was triggered (in my case an <a> element)?
[09:01:18] <Guest4525> Nobody got an idea about it?
[09:04:29] <ecky--ptang-zoob> 6b
[09:05:11] <beancurd> yep.
[09:07:09] <Guest4525> I do initialize the code like that: https://gist.github.com/Cruiser13/01de9db8a7c755e81795
[09:16:51] <Guest4525> Output is $('#appointment-date').datepicker($.extend({}, $.datepicker.regional['de'], {"dateFormat":"dd.mm.yy","beforeShowDay":"\"available()\"","minDate":1,"maxDate":5}));
[10:08:56] <rindolf> Hi all.
[10:26:05] <dwarder> hmmm is it ok that click event doesn't work with #canvas html5
[10:30:56] <decx> that isnt a problem
[10:31:10] <decx> or rather, your problem must be somewhere else
[10:43:56] <ophi491> Does publishing a chrome extension grant everyone the right to edit/distribute it
[10:46:16] <rindolf> ophi491: how is this related to jQuery?
[10:58:26] <ophi491> nvm
[11:09:13] <DeltaHeavy> Anybody want to critisize the way I do simple AJAX requests? Wondering if I can improve how I do it. Just using jQ's $.ajax() and uses the only PHP in the whole site to add an email to a MailChimp list - https://www.refheap.com/85343
[11:41:55] <Tomashe> Hey guys
[11:42:10] <Tomashe> really need some help here , i want to use this camanJS http://camanjs.com/guides/
[11:42:33] <rindolf> Tomashe: hi.
[11:42:34] <Tomashe> looks like it has presets that written in .coffee, anyone knows how the hell do i load them into my project to use them with js ?
[11:42:43] <Tomashe> hi rindolf
[11:42:44] <rindolf> Tomashe: CoffeeScript.
[11:42:52] <Tomashe> yes but how do i run them
[11:42:56] <rindolf> Tomashe: you need to compile them into JS.
[11:43:00] <Tomashe> how ?
[11:43:26] <rindolf> Tomashe: CoffeeScript has a compiler written in itself which is compiled into JS and you can run it using node.js.
[11:44:19] <Tomashe> yes but i have index.html file with include js scripts
[11:44:30] <Tomashe> how do i load the coffee code , i really dont get it
[11:45:04] <BillCris_> Tomashe: http://coffeescript.org/
[11:46:20] <Tomashe> hmm
[11:46:23] <BillCris_> Wait... why do you need coffee?
[11:46:28] <BillCris_> coffeescript *
[11:47:00] <Tomashe> i dont need it
[11:47:05] <rindolf> Tomashe: they probably give you compiled JavaScript files too.
[11:47:18] <Tomashe> there is some presets that writen in coffe. i want to use them in my website but i dont know how to read that coffee shit
[11:47:27] <Tomashe> no there is no compiled one
[11:47:38] <BillCris_> Did you download the zip?
[11:47:42] <Tomashe> yes
[11:47:58] <BillCris_> It's in dist/
[11:48:27] <Tomashe> i dont see the compiled filters there
[11:48:39] <Tomashe> where do u see it ?
[11:49:00] <DeltaHeavy> Anybody want to critisize the way I do simple AJAX requests? Wondering if I can improve how I do it. Just using jQ's $.ajax() and uses the only PHP in the whole site to add an email to a MailChimp list - https://www.refheap.com/85343
[11:49:12] <Tomashe> BillCris_ ?
[11:49:46] <BillCris_> Tomashe: What do you mean compiled filters? The whole thing is there in dist/caman.full.min.js
[11:50:04] <Tomashe> let me ee
[11:50:26] <Tomashe> IM A FUCKING RETART
[11:50:29] <Tomashe> RETARD
[11:51:36] <BillCris_> DeltaHeavy: Does  data: { email: $('#form-newsletter input[type="text"]') } work? Think you'e missing a .val() there.
[11:51:54] <BillCriswell> DeltaHeavy: Everything else seems fine to me.
[11:53:10] <DeltaHeavy> BillCriswell: You'd be right there. Lemme fix that up. Anyway any critisism at all? I kinda feel like there might be a better way to do this.
[11:55:22] <BillCriswell> DeltaHeavy: Nothing really ajax wise jumps out at me. There's a few little things I might change about how you grab certain data but that's about it.
[11:56:05] <DeltaHeavy> BillCriswell: You think I should have id's on the inputs or something?
[11:56:49] <BillCriswell> DeltaHeavy: No. Not that. What is the action attribute on the form that the submit listener is on?

[11:57:58] <edoop> sorry
[11:58:00] <edoop> BillCriswell sorry i have attached
[11:58:02] <edoop> my cut url.
[11:58:08] <edoop> Sorry Deltaheavy i had the copy of url
[11:58:23] <DeltaHeavy> edoop: Hm?
[11:58:34] <edoop> i wanted to ask if muse.adobe.com has maked by jquery
[11:58:47] <BillCriswell> I was going to suggest doing like var $form = $(this); $form.attr('action') for the url of the ajax options and $form.serializeArray() for the data option and so on.
[11:58:55] <BillCriswell> Butt as i said small things haha
[11:58:55] <edoop> i mean level interaction
[11:59:10] <BillCriswell> edoop: I think you might be a bit confused on where you are? lol
[12:00:11] <edoop> No problem bill
[12:00:17] <edoop> I m not confused
[12:00:31] <edoop> i want just your opinion
[12:00:45] <edoop> not was a technical question about jquery
[12:02:13] <BillCriswell> Okie doke.
[12:02:24] <shoky> what's your opinion, BillCriswell?
[12:02:40] <shoky> i want it too.
[12:03:09] <BillCriswell> I think it should be about 42.
[12:03:37] <shoky> sounds reasonable
[12:10:09] <sevenearths> jquery.js & jquery-mobile.min.js & jquery-mobile.min.css = 606kb. Do all of these files get cached on a mobile devices?
[12:10:18] <ophi491> is there a way to do a cors get request to a site that doesnt have cors enabled using an iframe?
[12:13:37] <BillCriswell> sevenearths: I don't see why not.
[12:14:14] <sevenearths> BillCriswell: just wondering because together they are quite large for 3/4G
[12:16:47] <BillCriswell> Yeah, it's a bit much but it's not that terrible. You can customize the downloads though.
[12:17:46] <BillCriswell> http requests are more troublesome than file size based on what I read.
[12:18:13] <BillCriswell> So if you could get all your scripts into one big js file and all your CSS into one big CSS file.
[12:20:17] <Tomashe> Bill , how can i use a keyword text as object like var key = $(this).text(); 	Caman("#cd", function () {	  this.preset_key('30%'); . which ofc isnt working , but hows the way to make it work?
[12:20:31] <Tomashe> this.key('30%');
[12:21:26] <BillCriswell> Tomashe: this[key]('30%'); should do it.
[12:21:55] <Tomashe> let me see
[12:23:49] <Tomashe> thanks mate
[12:25:36] <BillCriswell> No problem.
[12:43:49] <BillCriswell> Wasn't crazy abotu the first two episodes of Silicon Valley, but the third is awesome so far.
[12:57:05] * jphase agrees with BillCriswell
[13:22:37] <puchacz> hi, in gmail every subject occupies one row
[13:22:45] <puchacz> no line breaks, if it is too long, it is truncated
[13:22:49] <puchacz> how is it done please?
[13:25:02] <decx> css white-space: nowrap
[13:30:54] <puchacz> decx: and - sorry for very newbie question - truncating at say bootstrap's gutter number 8?
[13:32:44] <puchacz> I can think of z-index div covering the tail of the text
[13:33:08] <decx> no
[13:33:57] <__joshua__> puchacz: yeah, thats not the way to go about it
[13:34:48] <__joshua__> you can text-overflow:ellipsis; to stop overflow
[13:35:47] <puchacz> decx, __joushua__: thanks
[13:36:29] <sevenearths> BillCriswell: cool. I'm going to be using a CDN anyway. I was just wondering if +600kb is a bit much for an initial page load
[13:37:15] <decx> one benefit of popular cdns is that people have the big libs already cached
[13:38:08] <BillCriswell> "Thank you, Florida"
[13:39:10] <decx> "Things americans said in 2000 alex"
[13:39:35] <BillCriswell> Watching Silicon Valley, definitely getting better as it progresses.
[13:39:53] <decx> yet another long arc series?
[13:41:26] <BillCriswell> Haha I guess.
[13:48:05] <saddas> hello
[13:48:29] <saddas> Hello, I'm trying to make an ajax request. Collect data from a form using .serialzie(). The problem is that the parameters are passed only 1 time, if I double click, the request is passed emptiness. Tell me, what do I do http://laravel.io/bin/EGBj9
[13:49:49] <saddas> any body?
[13:49:54] <saddas> #javascript
[13:56:15] <BillCriswell> saddas: Are you removing the form or osomething as well?
[13:57:40] <saddas> BillCriswell yes,I'm trying to retrieve the values of all the selected radio button, and send them to ajax
[13:59:15] <BillCriswell> saddas: Right. It looks like you are doing that.
[14:00:16] <saddas> BillCriswell The problem is that if I click on the same button 2 times or more transmissible empty values. And even if I look to the network tab, then everything is going all right, but as soon as I click again, empty properties
[14:00:25] <saddas> and console.log
[14:00:53] <saddas> and this simple http://laravel.io/bin
[14:01:29] <saddas> if you press the same button twice, then everything goes wrong
[14:02:28] <BillCriswell> saddas: What is sended param?
[14:03:13] <saddas> BillCriswell This blocks that contain radio button
[14:06:29] <BillCriswell> Ok, so as you click radio buttons it resends the request over and over again?
[14:06:38] <BillCriswell> and when you do it too quick the data doesn't send?
[14:06:52] <dcope> hey all, is there anything in jquery built in to determine a typing delay in a text field?
[14:07:11] <dcope> i basically want to run some logic after a user types in a text field and waits 1s (similar to autocomplete)
[14:07:23] <BillCriswell> dcope: It sounds like you want a debounce.
[14:07:57] <BillCriswell> dcope: http://benalman.com/code/projects/jquery-throttle-debounce/examples/debounce/ should help.
[14:08:13] <saddas> BillCriswell yes
[14:08:19] <dcope> BillCriswell: awesome, i will check this out. thanks! :)
[14:08:25] <BillCriswell> No problem.
[14:08:45] <saddas> I need it because a person can choose a different option
[14:10:02] <BillCriswell> saddas: Can you set up a demo of this issue? It's not making sense to me.
[14:12:26] <BillCriswell> Not sure why sending another request would cause it to send empty data.
[14:49:20] <uberjar> Hi.  I have a for loop that is calling .append() on a div to insert content that came down from an ajax request.  below the loop I have another method that is applying styles to the objects that were appeneded
[14:49:41] <uberjar> the problem is that sometimes the styles are not being applied to all items in slow browsers
[14:49:41] <__joshua__> hmmmm.  what kind of styles?
[14:49:54] <__joshua__> thats very very odd uberjar
[14:50:05] <__joshua__> can we see some of the code
[14:50:46] <uberjar> well I'm using absolute positioning and using .css() to apply the styles that set the height, width, top, etc
[14:50:55] <__joshua__> right, makes sense
[14:50:55] <uberjar> I'll prepare a fiddle in a minute
[14:51:14] <uberjar> I have a fix, I'm using setTimeout with 100millisecond delay
[14:51:23] <uberjar> to apply the styles
[14:51:32] <uberjar> and the problem seems fixed, but yea I shoudln't ahve to do that
[14:51:37] <uberjar> fiddle in a few.. brb
[14:52:15] <BillCriswell> uberjar: I've experienced that. Instead of that someone told me to do like $el.offset().left to refresh the position of things.
[14:54:02] <uberjar> BillCriswell: thanks! that's a great suggestion I'll try that
[14:54:11] <__joshua__> hes right, calling root.offset().left;  will force a reflow
[14:54:22] <__joshua__> or something similar
[14:54:33] <BillCriswell> That drove me nuts one night.
[14:55:20] <__joshua__> i would have guess that hitting height at such would force a reflow, buts its been ages since ive checked the rules
[15:03:17] <uberjar> no time for a fiddle I've gotta run.  your suggestion got the job done.  the css I was setting was left, top, and width not height, so maybe thats why it didnt' force a reflow
[15:03:22] <uberjar> thanks again guys
[15:04:27] <BillCriswell> Word.
[15:12:32] <decx> nobody said: don't append in a loop?
[15:12:37] <decx> cmon guys :(
[15:16:26] <BillCriswell> decx: The other issue jumped out at me and I kind of missed that part haha.
[15:17:18] <decx> now there's a timeout somewhere out there applying styles. you monster
[15:18:05] <BillCriswell> Haha I talked him off of that
[15:18:18] <BillCriswell> Just getting the elements offset fixed his situation.
[15:52:32] <sl33k_>  Could someone ELI5 what line 36 37 in JS does here http://jsfiddle.net/ArtBIT/kneDX/ ?
[15:54:09] <BillCriswell> sl33k_: If someone is drawing on the canvas don't do anything.
[15:58:20] <BillCriswell> sl33k_: If canvas is NOT drawing, sorry about that.
[15:58:32] <BillCriswell> Forgot the most important word in the explanation.
[16:18:46] <s5fs> always.. I mean never.. crap, how does it go?
[16:23:41] <motaka2> Can anyone please tell me why I cant submit .inputWithHidingVal When I hit enter when the focus is on .inputWithHidingVal ?
[16:33:52] <sl33k_>  thanks BillCriswell
[16:33:57] <BillCriswell> sl33k_: No problem.
[16:36:23] <BillCriswell> motaka2: Have a demo?
[16:36:47] <motaka2> sorry Can anyone please tell me why I cant submit .inputWithHidingVal When I hit enter when the focus is on .inputWithHidingVal ? noondreams.com
[16:36:56] <motaka2> BillCriswell: noondreams.com
[16:37:28] <BillCriswell> I have no idea where to even look here.
[16:41:20] <motaka2> BillCriswell: it is the first edit box on top right
[16:41:45] <dcope> is there a jquery plugin that mimics object-fit css3 property for backwards compatability?
[16:41:56] <dcope> i can't seem to find one searching for "object-fit jquery" but perhaps there is one under another name
[16:43:34] <shoky> motaka2: because there's no submit button. putting display:none on it is like having no submit button
[16:44:51] <shoky> motaka2: you need to hide it another way like position:absolute; visibility: hidden;
[16:44:53] <motaka2> shoky: So why does it work in firefox and also how can I hide submit button but yet submit the form when hiting enter key ? the js code to capture enter key is in Core.js
[16:45:15] <shoky> motaka2: because chrome and firefox behave differentlty
[16:45:22] <motaka2> shoky: Why not just visibility:hidden ?
[16:46:33] <shoky> motaka2: because it'll still take up space in the block it's in
[16:48:11] <motaka2> yes you are right
[16:50:17] <motaka2> shoky: thx
[17:01:27] <frank_o> Hi, for these parallaxed images inside this rectangle that expand on hover: http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/V728z/embedded/result/ -- how does one prevent the parallaxed area from "shooting out of view" once the rectangle is hovered?
[17:03:18] <__joshua__> well the xtransform is massive on hover.  just reset it?
[17:03:46] <frank_o> __joshua__: Sorry xtransform?
[17:05:13] <__joshua__> the x component of the translate3d.  are you using a library for this?
[17:05:43] <frank_o> __joshua__: Yep. I should have mentioned. https://github.com/wagerfield/parallax
[17:05:58] <frank_o> Coolest parallax plug ever :)
[17:06:38] <tw2113> shoky, i think i did a bad thing :D
[17:07:12] <__joshua__> frank_o: add a limit-x?
[17:09:43] <frank_o> __joshua__: well i dont really want to limit the x, i want it to flow freely. its just that the whole expansion thing throws it off balance, and then i have to use my mouse to navigate it back into place. maybe i should use some sorta jquery centering plugin to center the .wrapper after expansion?
[17:10:30] <frank_o> or somehow make .wrapper stay in its place while expanding
[17:10:41] <frank_o> sorry not .wrapper, i mean .main
[17:11:17] <__joshua__> just try it.  works for me
[17:11:40] <frank_o> __joshua__: what did you limit it to?
[17:11:51] <__joshua__> 200
[17:12:36] <__joshua__> also, maybe reinitialize it on resize
[17:13:09] <frank_o> hmm yeah maybe i should
[17:13:20] <frank_o> 200 almost did the trick, but sorta messes up movement on the x axis
[17:13:51] <__joshua__> yeah, its not quite right
[17:14:32] <frank_o> damn close though
[17:19:41] <frank_o> __joshua__: tried reloading both packery (which places the images next to each other) and parallax but.. :( http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/V728z/4/
[17:25:55] <bhldev_> evening guys
[17:26:18] <bhldev_> so for $.ajaxPrefilter, it would apply to all types of ajax requests even non-jquery ones right?
[17:27:10] <bhldev_> I would like to achieve the following: intercept all ajax requests no matter the framework, then cancel the request and respond with a mock object.
[17:32:44] <__joshua__> $.ajaxPrefilter almost certainly only does $.ajax calls
[17:32:48] <__joshua__> but im guessing
[17:33:08] <__joshua__> this http://stackoverflow.com/questions/629671/how-can-i-intercept-xmlhttprequests-from-a-greasemonkey-script
[17:33:14] <bhldev_> okay better question what mocking library do you guys use
[17:33:52] <__joshua__> so you need to replace XMLHttpRequest
[17:33:55] <bhldev_> hrm joshua okay I will mess around with the xmlhttprequest prototype
[17:39:28] <zquad> why does $('select').children(':selected') return an array of 2 objects?
[17:44:37] <__joshua__> what are the two objs?
[17:45:07] <__joshua__> are there 2 selects on your page?
[17:46:13] <zquad> http://jsfiddle.net/YaLAa/2/  <-- why does that javascript return an array of two objects?
[17:52:55] <__joshua__> zquad: I only get 1?
[17:52:56] <zquad> __joshua__ the two objects are a duplicate of each other
[17:52:56] <whitby> zquad: what is `:selected`?
[17:52:56] <__joshua__> $('select.phones').children(':selected').length === 1
[17:52:56] <zquad> $('select.selectAllDevices').find('option:selected').length === 2
[17:52:56] <__joshua__> whitby: its a pseudo selector for the selected option
[17:52:57] <whitby> Thanks, yes. Just checked the API.
[17:52:57] <zquad> __joshua__: [ <option value=â€‹"390283df-c3f2-5137-beac-e8c46cb5a0a4" selected=â€‹"selected">â€‹Jenny's Phoneâ€‹</option>â€‹ ,  <option value=â€‹"390283df-c3f2-5137-beac-e8c46cb5a0a4" selected=â€‹"selected">â€‹Jenny's Phone</option>â€‹ ]
[17:52:57] <__joshua__> zquad: that doesn't match your fiddle.
[17:53:19] <zquad> should I just use .eq(0) for the hell of it?
[17:53:28] <__joshua__> no, something else is screwy
[17:53:56] <__joshua__> are you really sure you don't have 2 selects
[17:54:17] <zquad> ooooooh
[17:54:28] <zquad> let me check
[17:57:17] <zquad> __joshua__ you were right lol. I created the element from a template which is hidden on the page, I needed to use a more specific selector
[17:59:51] <ophi491> do you make asynchronous functions finish executing first with promises? or do I have to specify a callback function?
[18:00:10] <__joshua__> yeah, is almost never a good idea to use a global selector.  I typically use this.$('blah').  or $('blah', this.$el);
[18:00:41] <__joshua__> ophi491: confuse here.  jquery ajax calls are jquery promises.
[18:00:56] <__joshua__> $.get(url).done(done_handler).fail(fail_handler);
[18:02:16] <whitby> ophi491: Promises don't "wait" for async functions to finish first
[18:02:21] <__joshua__> or maybe $.get(url1).then(function(){ return $.get(url2); });
[18:03:05] <whitby> It's just another way of specifying a "callback" that'll run on either success for fail
[18:03:06] <ophi491> im using the chrome.storage api and am trying to make one function that uses it finish executing first, and then call the second function that uses it
[18:03:07] <__joshua__> jquery resolution IS however syncrhonous.  I think this was a mistake
[18:03:49] <whitby> What's using promises, the Chrome storage API or something else?
[18:03:53] <__joshua__> right, so you need to promisify the api call.
[18:04:17] <ophi491> oh okay, i dont have any promises yet im just trying to figure out where they go
[18:05:14] <__joshua__> function APISomething(){ var deferred = $.Deferred();  async_all(function callback(){ deferred.resolve(); });  return deferred.promise(); });
[18:05:31] <__joshua__> now you can APISomething().then(APISomething):
[18:06:34] <ophi491> okay awesome thanks ill try that
[18:07:06] <ophi491> if im making multiple async calls does each following call have to be in the callback of the previous?
[18:09:49] <__joshua__> no, thats one of the many reasons to use promises
[18:37:14] <querying_j> hello
[18:37:23] <querying_j> I have a conceptual question
[18:37:33] <querying_j> I have a table, each record has a checkbox and a "name"
[18:38:04] <querying_j> I want the user to be able to select a series of records by clicking the checkbox, hit an edit button, and a modal appears with textboxes so they can edit the names of each selected record
[18:38:08] <querying_j> how do-able is this?
[18:39:55] <__joshua__> well.....
[18:40:48] <mdpatrick> Hey guys, I'm using $.post, and it keeps trigering the fail callback even though I can see right in chrome the ajax call got a 200 success
[18:40:57] <mdpatrick> Any idea whats going on with that?
[18:41:02] <__joshua__> on edit click, $('.my_edit').on('click',   get the checkboxes info names = $(table).find('input:checked').map(function(){ return $(this).attr('name')' }).toArray();
[18:41:43] <__joshua__> show a model. $('<div/>').modal({ show: function(){  append all the crap into the modal });
[18:42:02] <__joshua__> pdpatrick: it might be the handler is failing
[18:42:06] <__joshua__> mdpatrick:
[18:42:37] <mdpatrick> __joshua__: the done handler?
[18:42:51] <__joshua__> what is in your done handler?
[18:46:06] <mdpatrick> __joshua__: I see a 200 success ajax request in my network panel and yet onlyfail is trigerred, no done: http://jsfiddle.net/GF7Q3/
[18:46:56] <__joshua__> well, you should have var json = JSON.parse(data); rather than var json = JSON.parse(data.responseText);
[18:47:48] <mdpatrick> console.log(done) isn't even trigered
[18:48:01] <mdpatrick> console.log('done')
[18:48:35] <__joshua__> other problems: it might have content type 'text/json', but not be valid json
[18:50:46] <querying_j> what do I do with this joshua? $(table).find('input:checked').map(function(){ return $(this).attr('name')' }).toArray();
[18:51:00] <querying_j> how do I convert that array into a series of rows in the modal?
[18:52:40] <__joshua__> you will need to render them.  for example: var wrapper = $('<ul/>');  names.forEach(function(name){ wrapper.append($('<li/>').text(name')); });
[18:53:28] <mdpatrick> __joshua__: Ahhhhh! You were right, sorta! Wrong HTTP header -- correct json
[19:07:38] <SirLagz> Why would a $.getJSON() request not be running the success function ?
[19:07:47] <SirLagz> the json is valid as far as I can tell
[19:08:00] <SirLagz> I checked the json with an online validater
[19:09:20] <__joshua__> same origin issues maybe
[19:09:42] <SirLagz> url is a simple relative path
[19:10:38] <__joshua__> do a $.get(url).done(function(data){ console.log(data); var read = JSON.parse(data);  and see what error you get
[19:10:39] <BillCriswell> SirLagz: Are the right response headers set?
[19:11:53] <__joshua__> content type should probably be application/json, or text/json
[19:11:58] <SirLagz> BillCriswell: I don't see why they wouldn't be...but I'll check
[19:12:31] <SirLagz> actually I think I know what I did wrong =/
[19:12:54] <BillCriswell> Ruh-roh
[19:13:08] <SirLagz> bah. Forgot to comment out some debugging stuff in the page that spits out json lol
[19:13:11] <SirLagz> derp
[19:13:38] <SirLagz> thanks guys
[19:14:32] <BillCriswell> No problem.
[20:41:14] <Starcraftmazter> hi
[20:41:24] <Starcraftmazter> is it possible to check if a selector is the same as another selector?
[20:41:29] <Starcraftmazter> ie. if both select the same dom element?
[20:54:35] <hypknight> Anyone have an issue with the latest jQuery and lazylinepainter? I get this: TypeError: b.svgData[h] is undefined
[21:16:40] <Fernandos> hi
[21:17:36] <SirLagz> Fernandos: hi
[21:17:51] <Fernandos> what's a nice way to ask the user only once to click on a specific link (for a 360Â° tour in this case)
[21:18:09] <SirLagz> "please only click once" ?
[21:18:19] <Fernandos> SirLagz: hahahahahha :D
[21:18:46] <Fernandos> Speaking about a popup/modal dialog or similar
[21:20:15] <SirLagz> Fernandos: I'd just script it to ignore any subsequent clicks
[21:22:11] <Fernandos> SirLagz: I could use cookies, to do that, it's not the problem. But I'm looking for a kind of unobstrusive way to inform the user about the 360Â° tour.. there are many lightbox scripts and similar, just not sure what would be less annoying
[21:22:45] <SirLagz> oohhhhh i get what you're trying tod o nwo
[21:22:46] <SirLagz> do nwo*
[21:22:49] <SirLagz> do. now.*
[21:22:55] <Fernandos> showing a sliding dialog in the bottom-right corner is sneaky for example
[21:23:16] <SirLagz> drop down a bar at the top of the page, similar to the IE information bar
[21:23:29] <Fernandos> blocking the whole view with a giant popup with just a message like: hey we have a cool 360Â° tour and whatnot is also annoying
[21:24:01] <Fernandos> SirLagz: hmm... that could be an option..
[21:24:13] <Fernandos> SirLagz: and you wouldn't find that annoying personally?
[21:24:22] <SirLagz> Fernandos: nope
[21:24:29] <SirLagz> Fernandos: it's not that intrusive
[21:24:35] <SirLagz> i find pop up boxes much more intrusive
[21:24:46] <Fernandos> me neither. It would be annoying if it's there all the time, but only once is acceptable
[21:24:56] <SirLagz> yep. and have the standard 'x' to close the bar
[21:25:06] <Fernandos> right
[21:26:05] <Fernandos> Do you btw. know a jquery library that shows such info-bars?
[21:26:17] <SirLagz> Fernandos: no sorry
[21:26:45] <Fernandos> I'm sure that I can use it for other stuff later too, like job offers and for outdated browsers
[22:01:42] <querying_j> test
[22:03:55] <__joshua__> test passed
