[12:45:49] <igcewieling> Hmmm...I just got a call from our sales department.   They are apparently not scared enough of me. 8-|
[12:47:34] <robertmaxrees> ?
[12:48:56] <igcewieling> Sales should always be slightly hesitant to bother engineering with stupid questions.
[12:49:15] <robertmaxrees> no they shouldn't.
[12:49:45] <robertmaxrees> if sales is asking "stupid" questions, they aren't being educated nearly well enough by the technology department.
[12:49:48] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[12:55:24] <igcewieling> Sales should be asking stupid questions of the techs in the office.
[12:55:48] <robertmaxrees> lol
[12:56:59] <igcewieling> In this specific case, it was not an especially stupid question and they were on the road and, most importantly, they were calling to checking something before telling the customer.
[12:57:20] <igcewieling> Usually they just make shit up and expect me to "just make it work"
[12:59:08] <robertmaxrees> sounds like a toxic environment.  reminds me why i don't work for an agency.
[13:01:43] <igcewieling> *shrug* I live in Florida, everyone else is in Staten Island NY so I don't have to deal with in-person stuff.
[13:01:58] <robertmaxrees> my entire org is remote right now so same ;)
[13:05:07] <igcewieling> Well, some of the office is working from home these days.
[13:06:56] <robertmaxrees> :|
[13:07:01] <robertmaxrees> why not everybody?
[13:07:20] <igcewieling> I'm not in management :)
[13:07:26] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[13:07:32] <robertmaxrees> oh, so management is in office?
[13:48:04] <snatcher> is there a way to modify jquery composite object?
[13:48:23] <robertmaxrees> snatcher what do you mean?
[13:49:50] <snatcher> robertmaxrees: add some jquery objects to existent jquery object
[13:50:21] <robertmaxrees> https://api.jquery.com/add/
[13:51:06] <robertmaxrees> never heard it referred to as a "composite object" hah
[13:51:16] <snatcher> robertmaxrees: it creates new not modify existent one
[13:51:34] <robertmaxrees> snatcher yeah - that's about as good as it gets.  $foo = $foo.add($bar);
[13:52:13] <snatcher> robertmaxrees: cannot reassign because jquery object passed to some callback
[13:52:26] <robertmaxrees> not sure i follow.  i'd have to see the code.
[13:55:33] <snatcher> robertmaxrees: jquery $object passed to some pre-processor in some class method if pre-processor defined, need to preprocess $object, is it possible or not?
[13:55:48] <robertmaxrees> i'd have to see the code.
[13:56:14] <robertmaxrees> not sure waht you mean by "pre-processor" in this context, for instance.
[13:56:38] <snatcher> there is so much code, is really big effort to prepare code before sharing
[13:57:05] <robertmaxrees> don't need all of it, just an example indicative of what you're doing.
[13:59:46] <snatcher> https://stackoverflow.com/a/3954532 related answer, but merge is different and not sure even if valid (merge() doc doesn't(? mention jquery objects as arguments)
[14:00:16] <robertmaxrees> merge isn't what you want.
[14:00:19] <snatcher> by different i mean it doesn't eliminate duplicate and doesn't preserve order as add()
[14:00:20] <robertmaxrees> that deals with arrays.
[14:01:27] <snatcher> so is there a way to modify existent jquery object?
[14:01:35] <robertmaxrees> you can kludge it to sort of get you there, but it's not really the right tool for the job.
[14:01:38] <robertmaxrees> lol
[14:01:44] <robertmaxrees> i've already answered that question :)
[14:02:34] <snatcher> add() from answer creates new $object, not modifying existent one
[14:02:38] <robertmaxrees> correct.
[14:02:43] <robertmaxrees> that's the only option you have.
[14:03:00] <robertmaxrees> there's no "modify in place" option, nor would you want one.
[14:03:23] <robertmaxrees> i might re-think your strategy to not rely on modifying an array in-place.
[14:03:31] <robertmaxrees> *array/jquery object/whatever
[14:04:06] <snatcher> so there is no way, is there any reason to not provide way to modify array-like $objects?
[14:04:36] <robertmaxrees> in general, you don't want to modify objects.  you should be generating new ones instead.
[14:34:45] <snatcher> what's the simplest way to filter detached elements?
[14:36:42] <robertmaxrees> $foo.closest(document.documentElemennt).length
[14:37:34] <robertmaxrees> *documentElement, but you get the idea.
[14:41:23] <snatcher> so it should be .filter(()=>$(this).closest(document.documentElement).length) right?
[14:41:43] <robertmaxrees> since you're using an arrow function there, 'this' will not refer back to the element.
[14:41:55] <robertmaxrees> if you want to use 'this', then you need a reglar function
[14:42:06] <robertmaxrees> ffs *regular.  can't type today.
[14:42:43] <snatcher> hen .filter((_, e)=>$(e).closest(document.documentElement).length) ?
[14:43:00] <snatcher> *then
[14:43:04] <robertmaxrees> :shrug: sure.  did you try?
[14:45:45] * robertmaxrees whistles the jeopardy think music
[14:52:00] <snatcher> any ideas why .filter((_, e)=>{document.contains(e);}) doesn't work? >Failed to execute 'contains' on 'Node': parameter 1 is not of type 'Node'
[14:52:18] <robertmaxrees> make a fiddle :shrug:
[14:58:52] <robertmaxrees> i say that because out of context, i can't see any issues (though you need to omit the curlies or that won't do what you want either(
[18:49:05] <snatcher> why .is(':disabled') true for detached elements?
[18:50:13] <robertmaxrees> you mean inputs?
[18:50:25] <snatcher> yes
[18:51:04] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/gdpf43ku/
[18:51:09] <robertmaxrees> :shrug:
[18:51:11] <robertmaxrees> false there.
[18:51:34] <robertmaxrees> creating isolated test cases is a great way to validate things like that.
[18:54:24] <robertmaxrees> maybe something is disabing the inputs before you check them?
[19:01:28] <snatcher> seems so
[19:11:12] <destramic> im tryinng to create a form in a function, but the html result back isnt the whole form https://pastebin.com/vG1jbhME  result and code here....why isnt all the html in the result please?
[19:12:17] <robertmaxrees> destramic can you create a JSfiddle of you trying to use it?
[19:12:55] <destramic> yes i can, one second
[19:13:02] <robertmaxrees> oh nvm
[19:13:04] <robertmaxrees> i see the issue.
[19:13:15] <robertmaxrees> first off - .html() grabs the contents of the element.
[19:13:29] <robertmaxrees> second off - you need to have a single wrapping element around the entire fragment.
[19:13:59] <robertmaxrees> you can't have a bunch of sibling elements like that when passing to $()
[19:15:19] <destramic> ok thank you, so what is my best solution here please?
[19:15:25] <destramic> here is the jsfiddle incase https://jsfiddle.net/destramic/ozgrn43p/1/
[19:16:33] <robertmaxrees> ... make sure there's a single root element wrapping everything.
[19:16:39] <robertmaxrees> also: why use .html() here?
[19:17:13] <robertmaxrees> you're taking a big string, passing it to $(), and then... converting it back to a big string?
[19:17:17] <destramic> i want to create a html object so i can apply plugins to certain inputs etc
[19:17:48] <destramic> html obect then apply to body
[19:18:00] <destramic> string html together by appending?
[19:18:06] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[19:18:40] <robertmaxrees> why are you using .html() then??
[19:19:10] <destramic> good point
[19:19:36] <destramic> cause i can use $html.appendTo($('body'));
[19:19:49] <destramic> thank you
[19:19:49] <robertmaxrees> lol
[19:19:51] <robertmaxrees> no.
[19:20:01] <destramic> =/
[19:20:04] <robertmaxrees> err, sorry - $html being $(html)?
[19:20:10] <destramic> yes
[19:20:11] <robertmaxrees> and with the corrected markup?
[19:20:27] <destramic> whats the best way to correct the markup please?
[19:20:33] <destramic> append to it?
[19:20:50] <robertmaxrees> i explained it earlier - need to have a single wrapping element.
[19:21:02] <robertmaxrees> could be a wrapping div or something.
[19:23:26] <destramic> ummm sorry im struggling, do you have a example please?
[19:23:44] <robertmaxrees> what are you struggling with?
[19:23:54] <robertmaxrees> if you don't understand what I mean, just say so :)
[19:24:39] <destramic> need to have a single wrapping element.could be a wrapping div or something.
[19:24:42] <destramic> this part
[19:24:46] <robertmaxrees> yeah - what about it?
[19:24:51] <robertmaxrees> the whole thing?
[19:25:40] <destramic> yeah, i could var $html = $('<input etc etc>'); $('<more>').appendto($html);    ?
[19:25:57] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[19:26:04] <destramic> see im stuggling
[19:26:05] <robertmaxrees> because your html object will have the same issues.
[19:26:12] <destramic> ummm
[19:26:20] <destramic> then im truely lost
[19:26:44] <robertmaxrees> in the strings you've got - start with a <div> before everything else and end with a </div> after everything else.
[19:26:51] <robertmaxrees> there's your single, wrapping elements.
[19:26:55] <robertmaxrees> *element
[19:27:41] <destramic> ahhh ok so i just need a container
[19:27:48] <destramic> a <div>
[19:28:01] <robertmaxrees> or whatever element is most appropriate, yes.
[19:28:09] <robertmaxrees> a single element that wraps everything else.
[19:28:12] <destramic> brilliant, i'll give it a go
[19:28:56] <destramic> https://jsfiddle.net/destramic/7s2zuqrc/
[19:28:59] <destramic> thank you
[19:29:08] <destramic> :)  that was easy, but hard lol
[19:29:10] <robertmaxrees> fwiw i'd look into a templating engine.
[19:29:23] <robertmaxrees> otherwise you're going to run into more and more issues doing it this way.
[19:30:56] <destramic> robertmaxrees i'll have a read up about using a template engine when i get into bed, thank you for your time and effort, greatly appreciated
