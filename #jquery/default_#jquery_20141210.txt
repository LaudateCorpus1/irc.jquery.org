[00:00:02] <Cork> then loop them again and reset the old values
[00:00:20] <Cork> though this might result in data loss and interface janks for the user
[00:00:49] <jotterbot> Cork: hmm
[00:01:51] <jotterbot> perhaps before re-rendering I could get a list of currently "old-rendered" template data and instead of doing like $(container).html(template), something like skipping existing and appending the rest/new
[00:02:36] <jotterbot> gah, it's such a hack way of doing it.
[00:03:02] <Cork> jotterbot: what you could do is have the form in a div
[00:04:08] <Cork> and then do var newcontent = $(template); newcontent.find('#form').after($('#form')).remove(); $('target').html(newcontent)
[00:05:22] <Cork> jotterbot: the important part is to keep the old dom elements around so they never get destroyed
[00:05:39] <jotterbot> Cork: thanks mate. I'll have a tinker, thanks for that :)
[00:06:53] <jotterbot> gtg thanks for your help
[00:37:58] <DRSK> Any smooth way of having jQuery on click to "reset" a CSS3 animation to fire again?
[00:38:12] <DRSK> Can't really figure it out, I've removedClass and addedClass but yeah no
[00:41:37] <DevAntoine> hi
[00:41:39] <DevAntoine> hi Cork
[00:42:17] <DevAntoine> is $('.foo', '.bar') the same as $('.bar').find('.foo'); or one is better/faster than the other?
[00:45:05] <Cork> DevAntoine: no, i don't think the first is valid at all
[00:45:41] <DevAntoine> Cork: yes it is, it's the one I use everyday
[00:45:43] <Cork> $('select', ) == dom_or_jquery.find('select')
[00:45:47] <Cork> opps
[00:45:52] <Cork> $('select', dom_or_jquery) == dom_or_jquery.find('select')
[00:46:05] <Cork> i'm quite sure giving a string as the second option isn't valid
[00:46:31] <DevAntoine> Cork: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery/
[00:46:34] <DevAntoine> "context"
[00:46:41] <Cork> "Type: Element or jQuery"
[00:46:53] <DevAntoine> yeah, just saw
[00:46:56] <Cork> so *see above*
[00:47:03] <DevAntoine> so now I'm wondering why my selectors are working oO
[00:47:28] <DevAntoine> maybe they just default to the classic jQuery selector
[00:48:31] <Cork> DevAntoine: might be they drop the second argument
[00:48:38] <Cork> donno right now, digging through the code
[00:49:13] <DevAntoine> but the doc states it uses the find() method internaly, so, considering the find can take a string, isn't it the same?
[00:50:20] <Cork> ah
[00:50:21] <Cork> return this.constructor( context ).find( selector );
[00:50:34] <Cork> so ya, it works, but not sure if it is intentional
[00:51:05] <Cork> DevAntoine: well what i expected it to do (and it does) is context.find()
[00:51:35] <Cork> but it has a "i don't know what this is so just try to construct a jquery object"
[00:51:42] <DevAntoine> Cork: this.constructor == jQuery()?
[00:51:45] <Cork> yes
[00:52:17] <Cork> but this is a bit of a hidden feature, and you should prob avoid relying on it
[00:52:42] <DevAntoine> Cork: yes, I guess I should just use find instead
[00:52:43] <Cork> so i would recommend doing $().find() in this case
[00:52:50] <DevAntoine> I'm wondering what the devs are thinking about this use
[00:53:04] <DevAntoine> I like it, less typing than .find :D
[00:53:31] <Cork> but much more obscure
[00:53:46] <Cork> and i normally prioritize readability over typing
[00:54:09] <Cork> (as typing basically never is even a factor in development time)
[00:55:46] <Xatenev> www.10fastfingers.com , typing speed > 9000 :p
[00:58:24] <slax0r> 49WPM with a broken hand
[00:58:27] <slax0r> not too shabby :)
[00:59:02] <Xatenev> hehe
[00:59:07] <Xatenev> 172WPM, with no broken hand
[00:59:09] <Xatenev> ^_^
[00:59:58] <slax0r> nice :)
[01:01:49] <latemus> can i just place normal javascript in between the $(document).ready(function() { an } ?
[01:02:03] <Cork> latemus: yes
[01:02:13] <latemus> Cork: thanks
[01:02:15] <Cork> latemus: .ready is just a wrapped event handler
[01:02:28] <Cork> with some magic for backwards compatibility
[01:02:45] <latemus> cool, i thought so. it seems like i read that you could in a document on the jquery website a few days ago
[01:03:04] <Cork> latemus: you can use normal js anywhere in jquery
[01:03:12] <Cork> jquery is just plain js with helper functions
[01:03:16] <Cork> it isn't a different language
[01:03:55] <latemus> Cork: Perfect. Yeah the day i realized that a lot of what i was doing in jquery was just using object literals was a revelation
[01:03:59] <latemus> lol
[01:04:08] <Cork> :)
[01:04:17] <latemus> it's so handy! i love it
[01:20:22] <handel_mcbrie> does anyone know why $.when returns a promise?
[01:20:32] <handel_mcbrie> despite the docs stating it returns a deffered
[01:20:39] <handel_mcbrie> which would make sense
[01:20:49] <handel_mcbrie> $.when(new jQuery.Deferred()).notify == undefined
[01:21:39] <Cork> handel_mcbrie: no $.when doesn't return a Promise
[01:22:01] <Cork> cause that would mean it would only work in browsers that support Promise
[01:22:40] <Cork> handel_mcbrie: and you wouldn't be able to use $.when().done() if it did
[01:22:51] <handel_mcbrie> Cork: what are you talking about?
[01:22:58] <handel_mcbrie> do you even know how promises work?
[01:23:06] <Cork> uh, ya?
[01:23:14] <handel_mcbrie> 1. jQuery's promises are supported in all browsers jquery supports
[01:23:29] <handel_mcbrie> 2. Promise objects have a subset of the methods in a Deffered object
[01:23:52] <handel_mcbrie> so all promise objects have a .done method
[01:23:55] <Cork> handel_mcbrie: promise uses catch and then
[01:24:01] <Cork> not .done and .fail
[01:24:14] <Cork> so if it did you would have to sniff what was returned by $.when
[01:24:23] <Cork> to know if you should use .then or .done
[01:25:09] <handel_mcbrie> Cork: https://api.jquery.com/category/deferred-object/
[01:26:24] <handel_mcbrie> promises lack methods that change state (resolve reject, notify)
[01:27:31] <Cork> handel_mcbrie: your poblem doesn't really make sence
[01:27:38] <Cork> what is it you're trying to do?
[01:27:50] <Cork> yes $.when doesn't return so you can handle the deferred object
[01:28:00] <Cork> you never do with deferred objects
[01:51:08] <latemus> http://pastebin.com/vz6agY3C I can't tell why my .replaceWith is failing, any insight?
[01:51:56] <Cork> latemus: console.log($( "#narnia" ).length) == 1 ?
[01:52:11] <Cork> (inserted at line 10)
[01:52:23] <mooncup> lol @ narnia
[01:52:29] <latemus> lol
[01:52:31] <mooncup> the lion, the witch and the jquery
[01:54:40] <latemus> Cork: sorry man, I'm such a nood at debugging js; how did you use console.log, or more to the point.. what does that error mean? that the length of my div #narnia is 1? is that the length of the content of the div?
[01:54:48] <latemus> s/nood/noob
[01:55:01] <Cork> latemus: ctrl+j or ctrl+k (depending on browser)
[01:55:04] <Uhkis> unfinished regex!
[01:55:14] <latemus> s/nood/noob/
[01:55:15] <latemus> lol
[01:55:24] <latemus> hahaha
[01:55:31] <Cork> you need a regex to fix the broken regex :)
[01:55:36] <Uhkis> :-)
[01:56:37] <Uhkis> using regex to fix broken regex sounds... horrific
[01:56:46] <Cork> XD
[01:57:01] <latemus> :%s/s\/nood\/noob/s\/nood\/noob\//
[01:57:08] <Cork> s/noob$/noob\//
[01:57:10] <Cork> easy enough
[01:57:20] <latemus> hehe
[01:57:33] <Uhkis> i like that vim part there ;-)
[01:57:38] <Cork> :)
[01:57:43] <latemus> :D
[01:57:59] <Cork> just wish someone could fix the broken regex engine in vim...
[01:58:13] <latemus> hah
[01:58:17] <Uhkis> ps. s/$/\//
[01:58:33] <Cork> Uhkis: but that would add / to every previous line!
[01:58:56] <Cork> well the last one (no g)
[01:59:11] <latemus> neith ^j nor ^k did anything in firefox, whats the context i use that in? within firebug? f12 opens the dom inspector..
[01:59:34] <latemus> i see what you guys did there
[01:59:43] <Cork> latemus: wops i never really think about what i press :x
[01:59:48] <Cork> its ctrl+shift+k
[02:00:00] <Cork> sorry about that
[02:00:18] <Cork> my fingers does the remembering ^^'
[02:01:10] <latemus> lol i can relate. np at all. don't i need to tell jquery to log errors buy putting a line in the js file or something
[02:01:34] <latemus> in what contect do i use that 'console.log()'
[02:01:41] <Uhkis> how's vims regex engine broken?
[02:02:46] <latemus> i know it's supposed to be much more extensive than even extended regex, according to its creater
[02:03:14] <latemus> perhaps Cork was commenting on how much it differs from standard and extended regex?
[02:03:21] <latemus> that was my assumption
[02:03:51] <Cork> latemus: my biggest brain fuck is that to create a group you have to write \(\)
[02:04:10] <Cork> something that is 100% reverse of how normal engines does it
[02:04:24] <latemus> oh. yeah its very ugly no doubt
[02:04:35] <suspicious_ee> Cork: :h magic
[02:04:37] <suspicious_ee> :)
[02:05:06] <Cork> suspicious_ee: well it just means i normally don't use regex in vim
[02:05:11] <latemus> but all regex is ugly man
[02:05:22] <Uhkis> !
[02:05:26] <Uhkis> regex is beautiful! :D
[02:05:26] <Cork> just cause i don't want to fuck up every other engine code i write just cause vim is broken
[02:05:32] <latemus> lol
[02:05:49] <Cork> regex is nice as long as you use it for what it is meant for
[02:06:04] <Uhkis> sed needs those escaped groups also
[02:06:07] <Cork> it only gets ugly when you write things in it it shouldn't be used for
[02:06:30] <latemus> i use awk a lot more than regex inside vim
[02:06:59] <latemus> speaking of writing things in the wrong language lol
[02:08:10] <latemus> so i'm trying to replace a div which is just an empty container, is that why I'm seeing .length = 1 ?
[02:08:31] <latemus> why is it complaining about length
[02:08:45] <Cork> latemus: if it is 1 everything is as it should be
[02:09:06] <Cork> latemus: what might be the problem is that you have invalid ids
[02:09:20] <Cork> (more then one element with the same id)
[02:09:47] <latemus> Okay. I'll look throught it, thanks Cork
[02:09:52] <Cork> latemus: if that is the case console.log($('[id="narnia"]').length) > 1
[02:10:03] <latemus> ohh
[02:10:04] <Cork> length should ever only be 1
[02:10:12] <Cork> in that line
[02:10:37] <latemus> ok. when you initially mentioned length, were you asking me what the console had output?
[02:10:45] <Cork> yes
[02:11:04] <latemus> K. i see. I don't have it logging to console yet
[02:11:12] <latemus> But once I do, I'll check that :)
[02:11:51] <Cork> latemus: though you most likely want to do .html instead of .replaceWith
[02:12:09] <Cork> as then if you use replace you will lose the container and can't do this again
[02:12:30] <latemus> Ok. I saw that done in the docs examples for .val() and i failed. i'll give it another try
[02:55:53] <Kingsy> ok why, if I have a toggle function... at the start of the "open" toggle I have jquery set to hide all toggle elements, then display the one clicked.. if you click another item it does it correctly.. it hides the previously opened and opens the new item which was clicked.. however if I click back on the previous item (which is now closed) it thinks I am trying to close it and executes the "close" toggle function.. why is this?
[02:56:06] <Kingsy> goes toggle not detect its display state ?
[03:01:23] <Cork> Kingsy: the toggle function has been deprecated and removed
[03:01:35] <Cork> Kingsy: or are you talking about the toggle that run show/hide?
[03:01:42] <Kingsy> yeah
[03:01:58] <Kingsy> but its ok.. I will just remove the close toggle and do it all on click.
[03:02:01] <Cork> so you're running code in the callback function?
[03:02:16] <Kingsy> probably easier to use click I guess
[03:03:26] <Kingsy> yeah thats alot easier
[03:03:33] <Kingsy> Cork: sorry.. but thanks anyway
[03:12:08] <jnhghy> I'm trying get get a .click function to triger for a tr that gets created dynamic but I fail at it :(. the tr has a class (filteredRows) and I tried with under function () { $(".filteredRows").click(function(){ alert(321);}); } and also under domchanged: $("body").bind("DOMSubtreeModified", function() { $(".filteredRows").click(function(){ alert(123);}); } but I keep not getting the alert, if I add the function in the console it triggers on click any idea w
[03:12:08] <jnhghy> hat  I should do?
[03:14:32] <Cork> ?g api.jquery delegate
[03:14:34] <b-ot> Cork: .delegate() | jQuery API Documentation → http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[03:14:39] <Cork> jnhghy: read that ^
[03:14:54] <jnhghy> Cork: thanks
[03:24:12] <jnhghy> Cork: thanks for the link, it doesn't run with on neither but I guess the issue is coming from somewhere else because the keyup trigger works but click doesn't, thanks for the link thow :)
[03:24:53] <Cork> jnhghy: the point of the link is you shouldn't bind an event handler on the element as you add it
[03:25:03] <Cork> you should delegate the event handler to a static parent
[03:25:30] <jnhghy> yap, got it, I'm doing it on the body tag ... :)
[03:26:00] <Cork> wait so a delegated event handler doesn't catch it either?
[03:26:13] <Cork> that makes little sense
[03:26:30] <Cork> jnhghy: also if you bind on body you can just as well use document
[03:26:37] <jnhghy> :)
[03:57:04] <jnhghy> I have an input field that opens a model with filtered data I want the model to be opened with insert key (that works just fine) where I have trouble is at forcing the user to use insert to get values from the model and not let him add text to the input (or to remove text from the input) any clue, link, info how this can be done?
[03:58:13] <Cork> jnhghy: just bind a keydown event on the input field and if it isn't an insert block it
[03:58:31] <Cork> alternatively you could set the field to readonly
[03:59:08] <jnhghy> if keydown is blocked for all keys, will the keyup trigger insert? I can't do it readonly it won't allow triggering for insert :)
[03:59:27] <jnhghy> insert = key  code 13 for keyup :)
[04:00:15] <jnhghy> yes, its working
[04:00:16] <jnhghy> :D
[04:00:20] <jnhghy> thanks again!
[04:00:42] <Cork> jnhghy: http://jsfiddle.net/ee6r1fdb/
[04:00:45] <Cork> works fine here
[04:01:33] <Cork> note key only works in "modern" browsers so you might want to use keyCode
[04:01:45] <Cork> depending on what support level you need
[04:01:51] <jnhghy> Cork: it's not working for me (I'm on chrome) I get false even if I press Insert but it worked without making the input readonly :)
[04:02:03] <jnhghy> oh, got it:)
[04:02:55] <Cork> ouch that kinda hurts
[04:03:03] <Cork> i actually expected chrome to support it
[04:05:21] <Cork> jnhghy: also insert should be 45 not 13
[04:05:24] <Cork> 13 is enter
[04:05:57] <jnhghy> yeah ... I'm bidding more keys and got them wrong in here but they work in the code :) thanks for the heads up anyway, you rock!
[04:07:58] <Cork> wow haven't looked at the compatibility list for .key
[04:07:59] <Cork> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/KeyboardEvent.key#Browser_compatibility
[04:08:15] <Cork> firefox and ie... that's a first O_o
[04:33:06] <anli> Is it possible to have qtip setting its positioning depending on document width?
[04:33:20] <anli> I want it to grow to the left when there is no room to the right
[04:47:50] <jrp> how can i catch when text is changed in an input, without the neecd to click out of it?
[04:49:16] <anli> Use keyup
[04:56:10] <jrp> oh thanks
[04:57:17] <Cork> or keydown if you want every keypress
[04:59:05] <Kingsy> can we emulate slideDown but with display:block on an inline element ?
[05:00:44] <Cork> Kingsy: emulate?
[05:00:49] <Cork> it should work just fine
[05:00:50] <Junior> hello
[05:00:53] <Kingsy> acheive the same animation effect
[05:01:02] <Kingsy> Cork: it does but it displays the element as inline
[05:01:10] <Kingsy> I need to animate it as if it were a block
[05:01:16] <Cork> Kingsy: meaning you set display: none in the css
[05:01:18] <Cork> don't
[05:02:04] <Kingsy> so the answer really is to put it inside a block an animate that.
[05:02:10] <Cork> no
[05:03:08] <Cork> Kingsy: http://jsfiddle.net/k8L99m1o/
[05:04:02] <Cork> just don't set display: none; in the css
[05:04:14] <Kingsy> ah ok
[05:04:21] <Cork> as jquery has no way of knowing that you want inline-block if you do
[05:04:28] <Cork> so it will default to "native"
[05:04:37] <Cork> and that happens to be inline for your element
[05:04:41] <Junior> I have an issue related to getJSON : i am getting some data from sql datatabase using php. Because it was very slow i have added script execution time to check where is the problem. So if i go to: localost/my_script.php i get: ==========> Script finished in: 0.336 seconds . If i run $.getJSON(localost/my_script.php, ..... it take minim 8 seocond. Any lead on that ( i do not iterate over the result or something else)
[05:04:48] <Cork> jikes
[05:04:59] <Kingsy> that makes sense.. but doesnt this mean that as the page loads the element will be visible for a short time then hide?
[05:05:00] <Cork> Junior: please split that up into question and backstory
[05:05:19] <Cork> Kingsy: no, just make sure to run .hide() on .ready
[05:05:26] <Kingsy> cool
[05:05:27] <Kingsy> will do
[05:05:52] <Junior> Cork to split it up... .getJson behaves more then poorly and can't figure out why (slow response). Any leads?
[05:06:15] <Cork> how big is the json response?
[05:06:35] <Cork> also how long does the server script take to generate the response?
[05:06:51] <Cork> those are you're most likely reasons
[05:06:55] <Cork> and most likely the later
[05:07:00] <Junior> will look now at size
[05:07:14] <Junior> the php script if i run directly : Script finished in: 0.336 seconds
[05:07:52] <Cork> Junior: and you're sure that is not hitting the browsers cache?
[05:08:04] <Junior> 41.2 KB -> 8.56 seconds
[05:08:38] <Cork> Junior: and you're sure that is not hitting the browsers cache? <--
[05:08:39] <Junior> Cork, yes , sure
[05:09:07] <Junior> will add now pragma no cache
[05:09:17] <Cork> hmm
[05:09:25] <Junior> it's not mysql query's fault as that was my initial assumption
[05:09:33] <Junior> one of the queries is run in 0.042 seconds
[05:09:33] <Cork>  41 kb of json shouldn't be a problem
[05:09:48] <Junior> Cork, exactly.. it shouldn't be
[05:09:50] <Cork> i often send hunderds of kb of json
[05:09:58] <Junior> i've "played" with 20MB of json
[05:10:30] <Cork> Junior: i would add some timestamp code to the php script and make sure that really is < 1 that you talk about
[05:10:39] <Cork> cause that REALLY is the most likely cause
[05:10:53] <Junior> Cork, that is what i already have done
[05:10:58] <Junior>  ==========> Script finished in: 0.336 seconds
[05:11:02] <Junior> this is from php
[05:11:19] <Cork> profile the page and check what happens then
[05:11:38] <Cork> Junior: btw are you sure it is the getjson call and not the processing of the response?
[05:12:02] <Cork> like a loop that adds dom elements and cases a ton of reflows or something like that
[05:12:39] <Junior> one second
[05:13:20] <Junior> 200 OK
[05:13:20] <Junior> 		511ms
[05:13:55] <Junior> this is the response from the same script if i output the content/loading time (so the string is no longer json)
[05:14:10] <Cork> that doesn't answer my question though
[05:14:23] <Junior> what question?
[05:14:28] <Junior> i'm not parsing the resulting json
[05:15:00] <Cork> so it is just a dead end getJSON call that doesn't do anything with the response?
[05:15:35] <Junior> var urll = "http://localhost/api2/pos/return_itemsofmenufull.php?locationid=....&format=json"; $.getJSON(urll, {format: "json"});
[05:15:44] <Junior> i've put it on a single line
[05:15:54] <Junior> this takes 7.8 seconds
[05:16:20] <Junior> for sure it's not a pc problem. am using a dual-xeon with 16GM ram
[05:16:27] <Junior> 16GB, sorry
[05:16:37] <Cork> you a test url for this?
[05:16:48] <Junior> haven't understood
[05:16:52] <Cork> cause this can't be answered with the lack of info
[05:16:58] <Cork> then you're on your own
[05:17:30] <Cork> all i can say is you're most likely missing where the time is consumed
[05:18:50] <Junior> let me try something else
[05:18:53] <anli> When I was looking at qtip2:s reference manual on http://craigsworks.com/projects/qtip/docs/reference/ , I see that there is a setting called "screen", but I cannot find any occurences of that word in the js file for qtip2...
[05:20:39] <Junior> i will separate now the request (meaning creating a new file)
[05:25:26] <Junior> I've done the following: created a new file named a.php . you can see the contents and the result in the http://pastebin.com/3mLTZVmQ
[05:25:36] <Junior> any ideea would be more then wonderful
[05:26:13] <Cork> a a dead pastebin is not going to help anyone
[05:26:31] <Cork> only way anyone is going to be able to help you is with a live example of the problem
[05:26:51] <Junior> dead?
[05:27:02] <Cork> as in not live yes
[05:27:18] <Junior> i am looking now at it
[05:27:32] <Cork> uh, good for you
[05:27:39] <Cork> it isn't going to help anyone else debug it though
[05:27:52] <Junior> ahhh
[05:27:53] <sacho_> Junior, put it up somewhere that runs your code. Make a live example.
[05:27:59] <sacho_> e.g. on jsfiddle, jsbin..
[05:28:10] <Junior> understoood.//... thought it's not displaying
[05:28:25] <Junior> sacho_ can't put in fiddle as i have mysql connection to retrieve data
[05:28:55] <Junior> not even a single ideea?
[05:29:00] <Junior> any ideea...
[05:29:07] <Cork> Junior: except as the problem is in a network call you most likely can't use jsfiddle
[05:29:22] <sacho_> Junior, well, mock the response.
[05:29:56] <Junior> nice..
[05:30:07] <Junior> is there other method to use to get json?
[05:30:17] <Junior> maybe is something wrong with my json?
[05:30:25] <Junior> and it takes alot of time to parse it?
[05:31:28] <Cork> Junior: if you get the data in the other end (after the 8 seconds) then no nothing wrong with the json
[05:31:34] <Cork> json doesn't do error correction
[05:32:28] <Junior> ok.. so if i go directly to the url i have < 1 second. you are saying that it's a communication issue between js and php so 7-8 seconds are lost...
[05:33:58] <Cork> Junior: i'm saying it most likely is, so excluding the server code and network connection has a very high likelyhood of not showing the problem
[05:34:34] <Junior> Cork the bad news is that i run locally both apache and mysql, so can't be a connection issue
[05:34:37] <Cork> Junior: but sure you could use the jsfiddles /echo/json service to try
[05:34:46] <Cork> Junior: it still can
[05:36:27] <Junior> i doubt it, but you know what you know
[05:47:30] <Eels> Hey there! I copied a script from a website, but I'd like to know how it works exactly before I use it. Would anybody mind explaining http://pastie.org/private/odvvitlpza2zrnatrjhtpq to me step-by-step, please?
[05:48:09] <Cork> Eels: start by reading through it and ask questions as you hit things you don't understand
[05:48:33] <Eels> This bit, for example: a[href*=#]:not([href=#])
[05:48:44] <Cork> css selector
[05:49:09] <Cork> an a tag with href including # but isn't only #
[05:49:43] <Cork> (should have had some quotes in there
[05:59:15] <ker2x> friendly greetings \o/
[06:01:48] <ker2x> i have a design problem. i'm develloping this http://ker2x.github.io/pbff/ the text (one the second page once you selected a checklist) was too small, so i used "2em;", now the text is big enougn on desktop and tablet, but it's too large on phone and instead of writing "Ignition selector" it write "Ignition Sele...". I know i'm obviously doing something wrong with "2em" but i don't know what to do. (it's jquerymobile stuff)
[06:02:48] <ker2x> i should remove this 2em thingy, imho. but how to make the text "big enough" on non-phone device ?
[06:09:43] <ker2x> mmm, could be in the meta actually
[06:11:40] <ker2x> or not
[06:11:53] <Koopz> hmm... weird... $.post().done(function(data){}); data = actual data
[06:12:13] <Cork> Koopz: you can't get data out of the callback function
[06:12:15] <Koopz> $.post().fail(function(data){}); data = not the data
[06:12:57] <Koopz> what do you mean?
[06:13:10] <Cork> also fail returns different arguments then .done does
[06:13:20] <Laban> You need to define a avariable outside of the scope and set it to data.
[06:13:29] <Cork> Koopz: done and fail is async, the code afterwards will run before it
[06:13:49] <Cork> or the data = might just be "explaining" the problem
[06:13:53] <Koopz> BS
[06:13:58] <Koopz> done works fine
[06:14:02] <Koopz> it always did
[06:14:07] <BillCriswell> lol
[06:14:07] <Koopz> at least for me
[06:14:15] <BillCriswell> Koopz: You've been very lucky then.
[06:14:23] <Cork> Koopz: so you do $.post().done(function(data) {}); and you can access "data" here?
[06:14:32] <Koopz> yes
[06:14:36] <Cork> O_o'
[06:14:45] <Cork> that makes absolutely no sense
[06:14:52] <Cork> data is local to the callback function
[06:14:59] <Cork> you can't access it outside it
[06:16:15] <Koopz> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.post/
[06:16:20] <Koopz> 2 examples
[06:16:27] <Koopz> the second one is just like mine
[06:16:27] <Laban> What if data is defined outside? Will it still be a local variable?
[06:16:32] <Cork> yes
[06:16:43] <Cork> it will be a local copy completely separate from the outer variable
[06:16:56] <Kingsy> if I use scrollTop in animate, that doesnt seem to scroll DOWN to an element, only UP, am I correct in assuming that?
[06:17:01] <Kingsy> just from a quick test.
[06:17:33] <BillCriswell> Kingsy: It will scroll anyway you tell it to.
[06:17:46] <BillCriswell> Well, up or down.
[06:17:55] <BillCriswell> Depending on the current scrollTop
[06:18:44] <Koopz> Cork the second example is exactly what i do, isn't it?
[06:18:59] <Koopz> wait i mean..
[06:19:09] <Cork> Koopz: http://jsfiddle.net/p07ekdpq/
[06:19:19] <Koopz> the snippet over "Deprecation notice"
[06:19:25] <Cork> "ReferenceError: data is not defined show:26"
[06:20:25] <Kingsy> BillCriswell: see this is the challenge. I have a $(this).slideDown(); and $(this).slideUp(); and that is on multiple items.. when you click one the other contracts. So the item which you click moves up or down depending on the other menus. I need to have the window follow the clicked item
[06:20:39] <Cork> except i failed at writing the correct url http://jsfiddle.net/p07ekdpq/3/
[06:20:42] <Kingsy> using this animate doesnt seem to be working.. I am assumgin its async or something
[06:21:52] <BillCriswell> Kingsy: slideUp has a completely callback, do your animate() call in there.
[06:21:59] <BillCriswell> has a complete*
[06:22:03] <Koopz> what the...
[06:22:14] <Kingsy> ah ha
[06:22:44] <Kingsy> BillCriswell: is it possible to do it at the same time as the slide?
[06:22:49] <Kingsy> just curious
[06:23:29] <BillCriswell> Kingsy: I'd think it would be extremely difficult to get it to happen smoothy. Unless you like.. know the height of the thing you're collapsing and recalculate the offset.
[06:24:31] <Koopz> Cork, say... does your console has the content of data even though "data is not defined"?
[06:24:55] <Cork> Koopz: of course it doesn't as it doesn't exist
[06:25:07] <Koopz> do you want me to take a screenshot?
[06:25:09] <Cork> if you mean why it is logged it is from the callback console.log
[06:25:20] <Cork> *if you mean why it is logged, it is from the callback console.log
[06:25:27] <Cork> "this works"
[06:25:39] <Koopz> "this works" "<p>Text echoed back to request</p><script type='text/javascript'>$('target').highlight();</script>"
[06:25:43] <Cork> exactly
[06:25:56] <Koopz> so... data was defined
[06:26:02] <Cork> inside the callback yes
[06:26:04] <Cork> not outside it
[06:26:10] <Cork> console.log('this will crash', data); <--
[06:26:12] <zoig> can anyone propose me nice example of jQuery in action in a form of some github resource or something similar?
[06:27:00] <Koopz> why does data exist outside of $.post()?
[06:27:03] <Cork> Koopz: if you prefer http://jsfiddle.net/p07ekdpq/5/
[06:27:09] <Cork> it doesn't
[06:27:29] <Cork> you claimed it did
[06:28:35] <Koopz> Cork, http://jsfiddle.net/p07ekdpq/7/
[06:29:35] <Koopz> why is there a "hue" after the data now?
[06:29:58] <Koopz> thought the data has been logged by console.log(data)
[06:30:18] <Koopz> but it has been logged inside the done-function
[06:32:39] <Koopz> we also do see that the done-function waits for the request to complete since it's callback is getting called after "the following will cause an exception"
[06:34:50] <Koopz> Cork, you said done would be async...
[06:38:07] <mbrzuzy> Koopz, it's because $.post has a return value
[06:38:12] <mbrzuzy> http://api.jquery.com/jquery.post/
[06:38:37] <Koopz> I knew that this would work
[06:39:30] <Koopz> He didn't want to believe me that the data from $.post() wasn't available in $.post().done(function(data){});^^
[06:39:37] <Koopz> was*
[06:40:00] <mbrzuzy> Well he might have misunderstood what you were saying.  You were talking about data existing outside of $.post
[06:40:12] <mbrzuzy> which isn't technically correct with what is going on with .done()
[06:40:23] <BillCriswell> zoig: jQuery in action doing what?
[06:40:50] <Koopz> but... .done() is outside of $.post() isn't it?
[06:41:53] <Koopz> and actually... i just wanted to know how to get the data in .fail() but i got it now^^
[06:41:59] <mbrzuzy> It's essentially part of the same object
[06:42:09] <mbrzuzy> since the request is actually passed back
[06:46:45] <Kingsy> BillCriswell: hmm I am still having an issue where it is animating to where the element used to be before the animation. even when I am using the function in a callback
[06:46:51] <Kingsy> does that sound normal?
[06:46:59] <Kingsy> it is scrolling.. just to the wrong place.
[06:54:03] <cjohnson> are you waiting until the animation is complete before doing the scrolling?
[06:58:13] <DevAntoine> I'm trying to structure my code well. It's a SPA, with one 500+L JS file, alternating between event handler and js functions. I'm already having a hard time to maintain my own code, I don't even imagine when someone else will have to edit it. What can I do to have a more maintanable and readable code?
[06:59:47] <cjohnson> separate the different pieces
[06:59:51] <cjohnson> hard to say without knowing your code
[07:00:02] <cjohnson> but there are probably logical differences between some sections of code vs others
[07:00:17] <cjohnson> find them and group them together, abstract things you do multiple times into helper functions
[07:00:39] <cjohnson> try to separate application logic from the code required to make your behaviors work how you want them to work
[07:01:21] <BillCriswell> Kingsy: http://jsbin.com/maguruyevo/1/edit?html,css,js,output something like this?
[07:02:06] <DevAntoine> cjohnson: that's what I'm already doing. Almost no code in the event handler, code reusability through functions
[07:02:16] <cjohnson> then you're on your way
[07:02:33] <cjohnson> also separate the different sections
[07:02:53] <DevAntoine> inside the file I'm manipulating the dom, capturing lot of events to change some form's fields state, I do some calculation depending on some form's fields state, etc
[07:02:53] <cjohnson> things that deal with the user's login vs things that deal with the menu bar vs things that deal with backend polling, or whatever you may have
[07:04:02] <DevAntoine> considering I have lot of duplicated selectors inside multiple functions, should I cache all the selectors in variables at the top of my file?
[07:04:35] <DevAntoine> let me rephrase: should my functions share the same jQuery object or each function cache the jQuery object?
[07:04:36] <cjohnson> depends
[07:05:06] <cjohnson> generally if the logic is funcA does something with a collection, then passes it to funcB to do something else with that collection, it would make sense not to re-select the collection
[07:05:21] <cjohnson> if the collection doesn't change with the state of your page, then you could pre-cache it at the top of the object
[07:05:45] <cjohnson> but obviously there will be times where you can't cache the selector since the collection will change as the page changes
[07:05:55] <effortDee_> i've created a dialog pop up and am after showing it within a date time frame, any direction i should go with this? jquery date?
[07:06:11] <DevAntoine> cjohnson: if func A and func B do 2 different things, they're not calling each other but use the same selector, what should I do?
[07:06:38] <cjohnson> depends if the selector may change bewteen the two functions (and any other functions)
[07:06:58] <DevAntoine> cjohnson: well, if the selector changes it's not the same right?
[07:07:02] <cjohnson> not selector, but the things it selects
[07:07:14] <cjohnson> say $('#widgets .widget') selects all widgets
[07:07:17] <cjohnson> and then you add another widget
[07:07:21] <cjohnson> obviously you wouldn't want to cache that
[07:07:39] <DevAntoine> cjohnson: the jQuery object won't update but itself?
[07:07:47] <cjohnson> nope
[07:08:09] <cjohnson> that would be a major performance issue
[07:08:31] <DevAntoine> ok, so I'll just cache my jQuery object by function and not for all my file
[07:08:40] <cjohnson> sounds good yeah
[07:08:53] <cjohnson> cache it for the duration of time that you're dealing with it in a single block
[07:08:55] <cjohnson> then toss aside
[07:09:21] <DevAntoine> yep
[07:09:35] <DevAntoine> about my file architecture, I just put all my functions and event handlers one after the other?
[07:11:18] <DevAntoine> I may put all the event handler in a function that I'll call the top of the file
[07:24:50] <Kingsy> BillCriswell: absolutely perfect! my animation statement was wrong
[07:24:52] <Kingsy> thanks man!!
[07:25:01] <BillCriswell> No problem.
[07:28:04] <DevAntoine> do you think I can refactor this: http://pastebin.com/BcgCnqDn
[07:28:13] <DevAntoine> it's almost the same code but I'm struggling
[07:35:39] <cjohnson> you could abstract that into a third function that takes the differing pieces as options... but I think it's fine
[07:35:44] <cjohnson> unless you find yourself doing this a third time
[07:35:47] <cjohnson> it's already fairly dry
[07:36:11] <cjohnson> don't try to optimize or refactor too much
[07:36:23] <cjohnson> the last 10% takes 90% of the time and is rarely worth the effort
[07:38:45] <AcidRain2012> if i dynamically add input to a form, when that form fires, will those inputs be captured and serializable?
[07:39:31] <sacho_> "when that form fires"?
[07:39:43] <DevAntoine> cjohnson: ok, thanks
[07:40:38] <AcidRain2012> to fire: v. the process of a jquery script recognizing an event. see 'inspect element'
[07:40:45] <DevAntoine> cjohnson: I wanted to refactored all the shit with angularjs, which makes much more sense considering my SPA has lot of complex states and validation rules, but I can't because "we don't mix the old with the new, no one will be able to maintain angular code, etc"
[07:41:20] <DevAntoine> so I take time to make it the more readable/maintanable as possible knowing there'll be lot of evolution to the initial specs soon
[07:41:29] <cjohnson> AcidRain2012: $form.serialize() will return data from all elements that exist inside the form at the time you call .serialize
[07:41:43] <AcidRain2012> thanks
[07:42:00] <BillCriswell> .serializeArray() is another useful one. I prefer that since it's easier to alter if I need to.
[07:42:32] <cjohnson> DevAntoine: you can go too far though, and may be shooting yourself in the foot. what if things take another direction and now your refactoring is actually making it harder to implement the new changes? etc
[07:42:44] <cjohnson> that's why it's best to not prematurely refactor and optimize until you actually need to
[07:42:58] <cjohnson> BillCriswell: can you pass that to $.ajax directly?
[07:43:02] <cjohnson> will it convert for you?
[07:43:10] <BillCriswell> cjohnson: Yes.
[07:43:13] <cjohnson> neat
[07:43:28] <BillCriswell> Agreed.
[07:43:33] <BillCriswell> cjohnson: Also nice with a console.table()
[07:44:23] <cjohnson> what's that do?
[07:44:30] <cjohnson> doesn't seem to do anything diff than log here
[07:44:54] <cjohnson> oooh needs an object
[07:44:55] <cjohnson> that's neat
[07:45:14] <BillCriswell> cjohnson: console.table( [ ['name', 'age', 'sex' ], ['Bill', 29, 'M'] ] );
[07:45:21] <BillCriswell> YEah. I dig it.
[07:45:49] <BillCriswell> Works better with an object but 2 deep array would work.
[07:45:59] <BillCriswell> and you can limit the columns with the second argument.
[07:46:14] <AcidRain2012> nice age
[07:46:37] <BillCriswell> Yeah... it's actually WAY closer to 30 but I'm holding on s long as I can to 29.
[07:46:59] <AcidRain2012> lol. 10 yrs from now u use same example ;p
[07:47:18] <BillCriswell> Haha I Will
[07:47:57] <zoig> BillCriswell : jQuery in action of  using HTML and CSS3 for creating nice looking animated website
[07:48:29] <DevAntoine> you're right cjohnson
[07:49:05] <BillCriswell> zoig: You're being really vague.
[07:57:10] <DevAntoine> cjohnson: considering the link I posted where I asked if it was possible to refactor, should I move all the event handler's logic in a separate function or keep it inside the closure?
[07:57:35] <cjohnson> it seemed good enough how it was that I wouldn't do anything with it really
[07:58:40] <Egoist_> Hello
[07:59:07] <Egoist_> could someone help me with cross-domain request and jsonp?
[08:00:44] <cjohnson> you would have to ask your question first
[08:00:48] <cjohnson> how else can we know? ;)
[08:40:01] <MikeD_> is there any reason to use one over the other between:  myobj.on(e1,..); myobj.on(e2,..);  vs myobk.on(e1,..).on(e2,..);  ?
[08:40:57] <shoky> nope
[08:41:27] <MikeD_> perhaps I worded that question poorly :)
[08:41:54] <shoky> seems fine to me ;)
[08:43:07] <shoky> i can elaborate on my answer though.. nope, there is no reason to use one over the other
[08:44:50] <gtristan> for purely stylistic reasons I would prefer the former, and I'm sure that for other stylistic reason, others might prefer the latter :)
[08:45:46] <MikeD_> thanks, that's what I meant... which is why I should have asked a better question in the first place
[08:46:40] <MikeD_> I imagine it would be easier to block comment around an single .on() call... but if that means the object reference was off the screen from the function code, it might be less readable
[08:46:55] <MikeD_> (agreeing with gtristan)
[08:48:40] <gtristan> I rarely prefer the chaining stuff, but for a random example: http://api.jquery.com/jquery.ajax/
[08:49:03] <gtristan> near the bottom where there is a handler for done, fail and always
[08:49:18] <gtristan> the . is always on a new line, and that is a case I find rather readable
[08:49:23] <gtristan> and clear
[08:51:11] <MikeD_> yes.  I've been writing .on(event, delegation {newline, tab, etc} ,function() );
[08:52:39] * gtristan nods
[08:53:08] <gtristan> I go nuts when reading some JS code honestly, I'm probably not a great reference, I prefer verbosity
[08:53:50] <BillCriswell> I really don't know how I decide to do what where... but I do switch up haha
[08:54:12] <BillCriswell> Which is a definite negative thing in my opinion.
[08:54:32] <gtristan> yeah, a common style is better than no style
[08:54:50] <MikeD_> do you refactor other people's code when you have to work on it?
[08:55:13] <gtristan> I do
[08:55:24] <MikeD_> when I find code that doesn't use indentation properly/consistently, my opinion of the author goes WAY down.
[08:56:04] <gtristan> but on the other hand, I'm flexible enough when working with a style I don't particularly favor, so long as it's consistent
[08:57:47] <gtristan> nesting of functions is something that annoys me greatly though, enough for me to rip it apart and declare 3 or 4 functions with actual comprehensive names, when I read something like callSomething (function () { .... callAnotherThing (function () { ...
[08:58:35] <s5fs> like function declarations inside of other function declarations?
[08:58:39] <gtristan> sometimes is brief enough, but when there is a lot of code, and you can tell the author was just too lazy to give a function a name, *that* drives me up the wall
[08:58:52] <MikeD_> http://jquery-howto.blogspot.com/2013/02/jquery-test-check-if-checkbox-checked.html  should I assume this author is untrustworthy for having written '#checkbox' a dozen times?
[08:59:10] <diamonds> can you do $el.on(...).then(...)
[08:59:12] <diamonds> ?
[08:59:56] <MikeD_> nm, now that i look again i see that it does list the html
[09:00:35] <MikeD_> though "caveats & problems"  is still confusing
[09:00:57] <gtristan> thats examples though, not production code
[09:02:26] <cjohnson> diamonds: what do you mean
[09:04:11] <diamonds> cjohnson, does jquery event return a promise
[09:04:15] <diamonds> like so I can chain
[09:04:27] <diamonds> I'm still grokking promises so forgive me if I'm confused here
[09:04:55] <cjohnson> different concepts
[09:05:10] <cjohnson> the .on is a little but like a promise .then already
[09:05:23] <cjohnson> what are you wanting to do in the .then ?
[09:05:31] <cjohnson> you would just put that inside the event listener
[09:06:18] <diamonds> cjohnson, yeah that's what I ended up doing, ty
[09:18:05] <latemus> i have put this line in my code console.log( jqXHR.responseJSON ); and the console is giving me this error: 'TypeError: jqXHR is undefined'
[09:18:40] <latemus> with what should i prefix jqXHR.responseJSON inside of console.log
[09:18:58] <robertmaxrees> can you share the context?
[09:18:58] <Bogdaniel> hello everyone. is this line of code valid http://pastebin.com/VkMVrC8f ? because it doesn't show anything .. and i'm wondering what is the problem because on console I don't have any errors.
[09:19:01] <robertmaxrees> latemus i can't know unless i see the context of the code.
[09:19:09] <robertmaxrees> sounds like you're calling a property on an argument that doesn't exist.
[09:20:12] <robertmaxrees> Bogdaniel is that selector valid?
[09:20:16] <robertmaxrees> and what is detailArray?
[09:20:35] <Bogdaniel> detail array contains some data from an array with html all around it. :D
[09:20:57] <robertmaxrees> Bogdaniel so it's valid html?
[09:20:58] <robertmaxrees> not an array?
[09:21:00] <guy> does jquery (or does anyone know of 3rd party plugin) provide functionality to extract data using selector? hypothetical e.g. '#ulCinemaList a[href^="/cinemas/"] [href]' I would like to return array of href attribute values
[09:21:01] <Bogdaniel> valid html
[09:21:04] <Bogdaniel> just a sec
[09:21:12] <Bogdaniel> i'll post you the entire code
[09:21:34] <Bogdaniel> http://pastebin.com/25Zi7ffh
[09:21:55] <Bogdaniel> it was working just fine but I added a second carousel on the pag e( with a different id) and now it just seems.. to be broken
[09:21:55] <robertmaxrees> guy you'd use something like http://api.jquery.com/map/
[09:22:16] <guy> robertmaxrees: yeah, I get that. I meant writing a query, as opposed to using something like a map later on
[09:22:49] <robertmaxrees> guy you mean a selector?  nothing in JQ i'm aware of, though you could chain that trivially.
[09:22:58] <blackkbot> yeah #carousel-example-generic > .carousel-inner is legiit
[09:23:20] <robertmaxrees> Bogdaniel sounds like something else is wrong then.
[09:23:26] <robertmaxrees> if adding a second carouself magically broke it.
[09:23:39] <Bogdaniel> ... i'm using bootstrap :D
[09:23:52] <robertmaxrees> Bogdaniel that doesn't really help me very much =/
[09:23:57] <Bogdaniel> akward thing.
[09:24:08] <Bogdaniel> everything tells me that it should work just fine
[09:24:09] <Bogdaniel> :))
[09:24:57] <latemus> robertmaxrees: http://pastebin.com/wKrnnrmp here's the .js file. I need to find out why the variables on lines 9-13 aren't getting assigned. This page here ==> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/ said that the results of a an .ajax sent with dataType of JSON should be accessible vie jqXHR.responseJSON, so i'm trying to inspect that object
[09:25:27] <robertmaxrees> woah.
[09:25:32] <robertmaxrees> first off   $(function getPrices() {
[09:25:40] <robertmaxrees> that's a little unusual.
[09:25:57] <robertmaxrees> second off - all those variables you're creating are scoped to that function
[09:26:08] <robertmaxrees> you can't access them outside of there.
[09:26:34] <robertmaxrees> third off - the code below that ajax call is trying to run before the ajax call completes.  you need to put all of that within the success callback.
[09:26:50] <latemus> robertmaxrees: i see about scope. the function was based on what i read here http://openenergymonitor.org/emon/node/107
[09:27:00] <latemus> probably outdated
[09:27:19] <latemus> also, i took the vars outside the function, obviously i shouldnt have
[09:27:20] <robertmaxrees> latemus it's that you're naming a doc ready like that.
[09:27:38] <robertmaxrees> $(function() {}) is the same as $(document).ready(function() {});
[09:27:45] <AcidRain2012> lol@errors
[09:29:21] <latemus> lol @ my noob-self
[09:29:28] <robertmaxrees> latemus http://fixee.org/paste/d9akynl/ this is closer to what you want.
[09:29:39] <latemus> robertmaxrees: thanks so much
[09:30:11] <latemus> robertmaxrees: oh hell yes, you fixeed it!
[09:30:20] <robertmaxrees> scope.
[09:30:21] <latemus> robertmaxrees: you are magical.
[09:30:35] <latemus> i totally see what i did that made it outa scope there
[09:31:07] <robertmaxrees> so the jqxhr thing - what did you see that confused you?
[09:33:58] <latemus> robertmaxrees:  when i couldnt see my JSON results in the data[] array i read the .ajax docs and got a little paranoid i was using the wrong array name, and i thought the docs were saying i had to access the JSON results via jqXHR.resultJSON or some shit
[09:34:33] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[09:34:51] <robertmaxrees> might have been referencing the jqXHR object that gets passed as an argument to your callback maybe.
[09:35:07] <Prometheian> Is there an event for when I re-open a tab from history? (control+shift+t, etc) I need to do an action if my webpage is restored.
[09:35:48] <robertmaxrees> i'd be surprised if there was.
[09:37:12] <blackkbot> you can setup a cookie...
[09:37:21] <Stummi> is there a selector expression for finding an child recursively? (an shortcut for $("#foo").find(".bar") )
[09:37:27] <robertmaxrees> blackkbot how would you use that?
[09:37:31] <Prometheian> But on page restore, no javascript is fired.
[09:37:36] <Prometheian> So no way to check cookie.
[09:37:38] <BillCriswell> What's the difference if they enter the page normally vs reopening a closed tab?
[09:37:40] <robertmaxrees> Stummi $('#foo .bar') is similar.
[09:37:42] <blackkbot> really?
[09:37:57] <robertmaxrees> there's also $('.bar', '#foo');
[09:38:03] <Prometheian> Throw an alert into a test doc, on doc ready.
[09:38:06] <Prometheian> open it
[09:38:09] <Prometheian> close, restore tab
[09:38:11] <Prometheian> fires once
[09:39:31] <blackkbot> oh yeah thats because if the page crashes and you restore it the code won't crash again
[09:39:31] <BillCriswell> Prometheian: I can't replicate that.
[09:39:32] <blackkbot> makes sense
[09:40:05] <robertmaxrees> something tells me each browser is a little different on that one.
[09:40:05] <blackkbot> get stuck in an endless loop and then open up chromes task manager and kill the frame thats the highest cpu and then go back a page
[09:40:47] <BillCriswell> http://crswll.com/alert.html
[09:41:05] <robertmaxrees> try a valid document.
[09:41:23] <robertmaxrees> with caching.
[09:41:55] <BillCriswell> ugh
[09:42:14] <robertmaxrees> i'll bet that breaks it.
[09:42:17] <Prometheian> Throw into $(function() {})
[09:42:36] <BillCriswell> Why would the script not run when the page loads?
[09:42:37] <blackkbot> what
[09:42:50] <BillCriswell> http://crswll.com/alert.html valid now.
[09:42:53] <blackkbot> it worked for me i closed and restored with chrome and it popped up twice
[09:43:44] <robertmaxrees> hrm.
[09:44:09] <blackkbot> i went to it from history from the back button and from closing the tab and ctrl shift t  all worked
[09:44:21] <BillCriswell> I don't understand how it wouldn't work lol
[09:44:25] <robertmaxrees> from history makes sense because you're opening it as a new page.
[09:44:34] <robertmaxrees> Prometheian what browser is broken?
[09:45:19] <Prometheian> Testing in chrome
[09:46:16] <Prometheian> Gonna turn off cacheing.
[09:55:39] <hlvwrk> ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
[10:05:37] <GreekFreak> hi all
[10:06:13] <GreekFreak> How do I add a method to a tooltip post initialisation?
[10:08:02] <Zzaichik> Care to elaborate? I want to say .on() but I'm not entirely sure yet.
[10:10:23] <GreekFreak> Zzaichik, creating a paste for you so you can see the code
[10:11:35] <Zzaichik> GreekFreak: ok thanks
[10:14:51] <GreekFreak> Zzaichik, here you go
[10:14:52] <GreekFreak> https://gist.github.com/tscholiadis/7d39cae5d9079e2545ff
[10:16:05] <GreekFreak> I stop the Tooltip from closing so that the user can scroll down. I then want the Tooltip to close when the user moves his mouse away from the Tooltip
[10:24:40] <Zzaichik> So you're removing the default action on mouseleave to keep it open, am I understanding that correctly? And then you want to be able to reinstate the default behavior after they hover over the tooltip so it closes?
[10:26:40] <GreekFreak> Zzaichik, almost. I am removing the default behaviour so that it can stay open. I then want to close it when I hover out the tooltip
[10:26:57] <GreekFreak> I found my mistake. This works (if you want) https://gist.github.com/tscholiadis/7d39cae5d9079e2545ff
[10:27:24] <GreekFreak> What I was doing wrong was that I was closing the Tooltip's tooltip (which did not exist).
[10:27:44] <Zzaichik> Nice
[10:27:48] <GreekFreak> I had to keep a reference of the element for which I was displaying a tooltip and then close it.
[10:28:21] <Zzaichik> Yeah you were losing the element. Good catch, I hadn't noticed that yet either. :)
[10:28:22] <GreekFreak> Zzaichik, obvious and stupid mistake but I think I hadn't wrapped my head around the problem lol
[10:28:39] <GreekFreak> Thanks for trying
[10:28:43] <Zzaichik> It's always something stupid isn't it? haha The ones that you can't figure out.
[10:28:55] <Zzaichik> yeah np
[10:28:55] <cjohnson> if it's still in memory it could just restore state of the whole thing right
[10:29:06] <cjohnson> oops scrolled up
[10:29:07] <Zzaichik> ^^ yeah
[10:29:25] <BillCriswell> Man, vh unit is awesome when it works.
[10:44:07] <GreekFreak> Indeed. Was battling with that for a couple of hours lol
[10:44:51] <cjohnson> anybody who uses jquery validate know how I can dump which fields are causing $form.valid() to be false?
[11:26:06] <Gay-champion> anyone here is a programmer unity 3d? 8à'8
[11:27:19] <robertmaxrees> Gay-champion you probably won't have much luck.

[11:43:23] <fenris_kcf> hy. is it possible to dynamically load an svg into an arbitrary element (which is a subnode of the svg-root) with jquery-svg's load-function?
[11:43:59] <fenris_kcf> (the normal behaviour is to load the content to the svg-root-node)
[11:47:01] <EchoBravo> Hi there! I am using jQuery UI for a .selectable() list - Is it possible to disable the control click so that only select clicks and drags are left?
[11:48:32] <blackkbot> what is a select click?
[11:49:06] <EchoBravo> Sorry, single clicks :)
[11:49:17] <blackkbot> double click and drag?
[11:49:39] <blackkbot> or a long hold?
[11:49:58] <EchoBravo> I want to disable the control click where you can select things that are an element or more apart from eachother
[11:51:51] <shoky> EchoBravo:  $('#selectableContainer').on('mousedown', function(e) { e.ctrlKey = e.metaKey = false; }).selectable();
[11:53:02] <EchoBravo> THANKS shoky ! <3
[11:53:49] <slacko253281> love is in the air
[11:53:50] <adamellsworth> how can you trigger third-party libs (bootstrap datepicker) via jquery?
[11:54:11] <adamellsworth> trigger('click') doesn't work
[11:54:42] <blackkbot> element.click()
[11:54:56] <blackkbot> unless jquery reassigns that
[11:55:41] <adamellsworth> that's not working either
[11:56:08] <shoky> use the library's API
[11:56:34] <shoky> https://bootstrap-datepicker.readthedocs.org/en/release/methods.html
[11:56:57] <adamellsworth> oh duh, thanks
[12:09:31] <adamellsworth> Has anyone ever had issues where inputs lose their events after POSTing data?
[12:11:39] <adamellsworth> Do I have to redraw the elements and attach new handlers after every ajax post?
[12:12:33] <StephenS> Hello, on key up, I use this: http://pastebin.com/QWdd1WA8 now thats not efficient, since for every key typed, it will call script and db overall, I need sometime between each chars, how to accomplish that for this live search?
[12:14:01] <adamellsworth> StephenS: is it viable for you to grab all the data before hand and store it in JSON and search against that object instead of calling the db every keyup event?
[12:14:34] <StephenS> not for now, I'm not caching anything atm and I dont want to
[12:14:48] <StephenS> I just want to pull up str8 from db, I have some typeaheads which is enough for me
[12:15:24] <StephenS> I just want a bit of relax between every chars, so lets say user types 200ms/char.. I need that time span.
[12:20:40] <MikeD_> StephenS: 'debounce' ?
[12:21:13] <StephenS> ?
[12:21:24] <MikeD_> ex: http://davidwalsh.name/javascript-debounce-function
[12:23:15] <StephenS> so how would you implement that with my code MikeD_ ?
[12:28:20] <cjohnson> wrap the event listener with debounce(
[12:28:32] <cjohnson> just like the example on the page.
[12:28:56] <cjohnson> but you'll have to move your JS into JS and out of HTML
[12:29:09] <cjohnson> or you could wrap it in an iife. but the former is a much better idea
[12:30:23] <StephenS> var myEfficientFn = debounce(function() {
[12:30:23] <StephenS> 	// All the taxing stuff you do
[12:30:23] <StephenS> }, 250);
[12:30:50] <StephenS> can I just add debounce(function showResult(str) { ... } /
[12:37:15] <StephenS> cjohnson example?
[12:39:38] <cjohnson> StephenS: for what?
[12:39:48] <cjohnson> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget.addEventListener
[12:40:33] <cjohnson> theNode.addEventListener('keyup', function() { /* the code you have in your onkeyup="" */ });
[12:40:45] <cjohnson> and then wrapped with debounce
[12:40:59] <cjohnson> theNode.addEventListener('keyup', debounce(function() { /* the code you have in your onkeyup="" */ }, 50));
[12:41:17] <robertmaxrees> you could also use .on() from jquery if you're so inclined.
[12:45:02] <WigglesMcMuffin> Is there a builtin way to create the 'flags' for querystrings (i.e. foo.bar?myflag&do%20thing) I know that you can use $.param for dictionaries, but I didn't see anything for a simple list, or singular value
[12:47:20] <robertmaxrees> "flags"?
[12:47:44] <StephenS> $("#searchmeup").on('keyup', debounce(function() { if (this.value.length >= 1) { showResult(this.value); }else {  $('#livesearch').hide(); } }, 50));
[12:47:48] <StephenS> Kinda not work, why?
[12:47:57] <SNAFUdowser> Hey guys... I'm working with Cycle 2 on my slider.  I'm trying to remove some elements from the slider, and then add them back to the slider afterwards.  I've been at this for a few hours and I'm still getting bugs.  What would you suggest the best way to do this is?  I've got access to an .add and remove function from Cycle2 but I so far have not been able to do this without breaking it.
[12:48:44] <BillCriswell> WigglesMcMuffin: Would it be so bad if you did like ?myflag=1&do%20thing=1 ? I'd just use reduce to get me back an object.
[12:49:30] <StephenS> nvm it works now
[12:49:43] <adamellsworth> why would inputs be losing their events?
[12:49:49] <StephenS> so whats preferred time in ms for live search query box?
[12:49:51] <StephenS> is 200ms fine?
[12:49:55] <BillCriswell> SNAFUdowser: It looks like just add and remove should work. Have a demo of it causing issues?
[12:50:09] <robertmaxrees> adamellsworth are they getting replaced?
[12:50:38] <adamellsworth> no, they're just disappearing and i never call off(), unbind(), or any other such methods
[12:50:58] <robertmaxrees> something is breaking the reference.
[12:51:11] <BillCriswell> SNAFUdowser: Are you doing $('#slider').cycle('add', '<img src="new-slide-jawn.jpg">'); ?
[12:51:24] <robertmaxrees> or something is binding later, which may be doing a .prevendDefault() or something similar.
[12:51:48] <diamonds> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/598ed050f6931922214aeaea8a1dc867e0cc6fb7/src/ajax.js#L511-L514
[12:51:50] <diamonds> c'mon
[12:52:04] <diamonds> #readability
[12:52:15] <diamonds> trying to figure out what setting "crossdomain" does
[12:52:58] <robertmaxrees> diamonds go let the jquery-dev channel know :)
[12:53:06] <diamonds> ah ok
[12:53:15] <robertmaxrees> if it's such a big problem, that is ;)
[12:53:35] <SNAFUdowser> BillCriswell: It's a slightly complex program so it's hard to do a simple demo, but I'll post the JS behind it and I can link to the full site.  And well actually I haven't gotten to the adding part yet.  I am still getting bugs on the remove.
[12:53:43] <robertmaxrees> diamonds are you asking what it does, or are you complaining about the code formatting?
[12:54:48] <BillCriswell> SNAFUdowser: a basic demo on jsfiddle.net should help with the issue.
[12:57:18] <SNAFUdowser> BillCriswell:  OK I'll try making one.  How close to the real thing should it be?  The actual thing that I'm working on is actually 3 sliders which when some options on the first two are selected, the 3rd one removes and adds elements.  Should I just make a basic thing with an "add" and "remove" button?
[12:57:45] <SNAFUdowser> removes or adds elements *
[12:58:00] <BillCriswell> SNAFUdowser: http://jsfiddle.net/rvq5rc0t/ this is what I have so far.
[12:59:00] <Snerf> SNAFUdowser, paste your problem code as well
[12:59:39] <BillCriswell> Which doesn't seem to be working lol
[13:00:26] <SNAFUdowser> Snerf: OK I should fix it up a bit.   And BillCriswell, lol I'll try continuing that example after I've fixed up my code and posted it I guess.  (I'll do it in a diff order if requested)
[13:00:54] <SNAFUdowser> (thanks in advance having hope feels good >.<)
[13:00:59] <Snerf> I have used jcycle2 a great deal, I prefer the html5/class methods for initializing
[13:02:13] <BillCriswell> I thnk the remove method is just busted.
[13:04:13] <BillCriswell> It stops the slideshow completely when you remove a slide.
[13:05:38] <WigglesMcMuffin> BillCriswell: I just ended up using $.map(flags, encodeURI).join('&') to create them
[13:05:49] <BillCriswell> WigglesMcMuffin: Word.
[13:06:07] <BillCriswell> Snerf: Does seem to work through the data- way.
[13:07:36] <BillCriswell> damn, 347 open tickets
[13:09:25] <robertmaxrees> for your whole company?
[13:10:13] <BillCriswell> robertmaxrees: No, issue queue for cycle2
[13:10:53] <robertmaxrees> ah
[13:10:55] <robertmaxrees> sounds about right.
[13:11:21] <Snerf> BillCriswell, yes, it should, I havent had issues with it using it that way at all
[13:12:22] <Snerf> i think the issue is, you cant remove items until the slideshow has initialized, the console should say
[13:13:56] <diamonds> robertmaxrees, well complaining about the code formatting because I can't easily parse what it does :p
[13:14:05] <BillCriswell> Snerf: Even if I put in a timeout or try to run it when a button is clicked there still an issue.
[13:15:03] <Snerf> BillCriswell, check your console, jcycle is great for showing stuff/errors
[13:15:14] <BillCriswell> It just says "cycle-slide-removed"
[13:15:27] <BillCriswell> then stops the slideshow, no pause or nothin.
[13:16:06] <robertmaxrees> diamonds then tell them that in jquery-dev, because otherwise it looks like you're asking what crossdomain = true is used for.
[13:16:11] <Snerf> well, he still hasnt pasted anything.. lol.. Im not gonna worry about it
[13:16:34] <BillCriswell> Wait... wtf
[13:17:17] <BillCriswell> Snerf: http://jsfiddle.net/rvq5rc0t/2/ so weird
[13:18:03] <BillCriswell> Snerf: Seems to work sometimes, seems to break sometimes. No rhyme or reason.
[13:18:16] <Snerf> probably an init issue
[13:18:59] <diamonds> robertmaxrees, mmm thanks
[13:19:07] <BillCriswell> Wonder if cycle1 has the same issue.
[13:19:17] <BillCriswell> I used that all the time in the past.
[13:22:17] <Snerf> ive never had an issue with jcycle2, and I have added/removed slides before
[13:22:35] <Snerf> just been a while :)
[13:22:41] <BillCriswell> jcycle?
[13:22:46] <BillCriswell> or cycle?
[13:22:54] <Snerf> jcycle2
[13:23:03] <BillCriswell> that's a new one to me haha
[13:23:15] <BillCriswell> Where is the J coming from?
[13:24:17] <Snerf> sorry, I have called it jcycle for so long..
[13:24:22] <Snerf> my bad ;)
[13:24:28] <Snerf> it is cycle2
[13:24:55] <BillCriswell> Oh ok haah
[13:26:25] <cannap> any know how i can append thing direct to the div i created with  var newRow =  $(templateDiv).append('<div class="row">value</div>')
[13:26:25] <cannap>  
[13:26:29] <cannap> ah wait new idea :D
[13:28:26] <BillCriswell> Ok.
[13:28:36] <SNAFUdowser> Hey guys!  I'm sorry!
[13:28:45] <cjohnson> something like this?  $foo.append $('<div class="row">').append('value') ) ?
[13:28:51] <cjohnson> append( *
[13:29:54] <SNAFUdowser> It took me a long long time to fix my code and make it something that won't just confuse people.  Maybe I shouldn't have spent so much time commenting but I feel it will help.  I was keeping up with what you BillCriswell and Snerf were doing and sorry I'll post the stuff now.  Thanks again.
[13:34:08] <SNAFUdowser> Hey guys so here is the site: http://loverock.nextmp.net/lrny/dyor.html and here is my JS: http://pastebin.com/dfbexSMb  I actually (while commenting) fixed one of my issues.  I now just have a weird issue with when the slider moves to the left.  Gosh I'm sorry this is so complex... So you can see the issue when you move the HEAD/PRONG over to the right 2 times and then start moving the 3rd slider.
[13:36:05] <SNAFUdowser> The first 2 sliders are changing the 3rd slider.  Inside my code, the bug almost certainly is within the "hideBands" method.  Ugh idk how to really get help this is too complex of a system just let me know what I can do.. idk.
[13:36:33] <SNAFUdowser> Like let me know if there is anything I can do better in presenting this.*
[13:37:55] <krooyh> i dont get that bug
[13:38:48] <Snerf> SNAFUdowser, when you use "goto" , no need to go +1, because that previous index is removed
[13:39:42] <Snerf> if you read your console, you would see that (goto: skipping, already on slide 1)
[13:41:22] <SNAFUdowser> Snerf: Ah your right... but now that I'm using goto index it's actually acting more unexpectedly.  I guess my index is off... ah I need to update the index on the elements... ah I see at least one flaw in my logic now
[13:41:40] <SNAFUdowser> (in addition to the one you pointed out)
[13:41:56] <Snerf> ;)
[13:43:21] <SNAFUdowser> Snerf: is there a way to get the current index of an element in cycle2?
[13:44:07] <SNAFUdowser> Because basically... well what I was doing was completely silly and obviously  incorrect when it comes to how the index was working.
[13:44:25] <Snerf> data("cycle.opts").currSlide
[13:44:40] <Snerf> sorry, thats a .data // but you get the idea
[13:45:49] <SNAFUdowser> Snerf: So it would be $(element).data("cycle.opts").currSlide ?
[13:46:28] <Snerf> $('.slideshow.band').data(...
[13:48:05] <SNAFUdowser> Ah but is there a way to get the index of an element within the slider?  Basically I want to delete a few of the elements of the slider but I'm not totally sure the best way to get their index.
[13:50:49] <Snerf> should be a way, check their docs
[13:51:11] <Snerf> .getSlideIndex() I think it is
[13:59:42] <SNAFUdowser> Snerf: Excuses the caps... YESSSS... Working perfectly thank you so much!  I mean now I have to get the add part working but really it shouldn't be hard.  Wow yay I'm going to buy some skittles in celebration.  Not sure why when I delete all the things it doesn't automatically goto the right spot... but I'm sure that's an easy fix.  Thanks and I may be back.
[14:01:09] <Snerf> :)
[14:04:09] <Uhkis> "but I'm sure that's an easy fix." the last words before a loooong night lol
[14:04:42] <BillCriswell> Had a meeting... good to see that worked out.
[14:05:14] <Snerf> a lot of things are easy, when you have a 2nd pair of eyes look at it sometiems
[14:06:09] <relipse> Why doesn't $myobj.data('foobar'); pull in the data-foobar="gus" ?
[14:06:40] <SNAFUdowser> Haha you're right... I've been working on this damn thing for the past 4 days (and long nights) and I still haven't studied for any of my finals... oy so hopefully with the wonderful help of you guys I can finish tonight so I can be a responsible student.  Thanks again you guys.
[14:06:42] <cjohnson> relipse: it does if the element was loaded with data-foobar="gus"
[14:07:01] <relipse> just in normal html
[14:07:02] <cjohnson> relipse: but if you for instance change the data-foobar attr by using .prop or .attr, .data won't retroactively read it
[14:07:26] <cjohnson> then $obj.data('foobar') should definitely read gus
[14:07:51] <Snerf> cjohnson, paste code or show your site please
[14:07:58] <cjohnson> Snerf: wat
[14:08:02] <cjohnson> relipse: http://jsfiddle.net/3r76gw5j/
[14:09:19] <hlvwrk> uhhhhhhhh
[14:10:27] <Snerf> cjohnson, yes, fancy, it works , but not on your site, correct?
[14:10:31] <relipse> is this valid: data-product-id="4556"
[14:10:40] <Snerf> yes
[14:10:43] <relipse> thanks for the help
[14:11:18] <Uhkis> Snerf: you keep hilighting the wrong person
[14:11:36] <Snerf> Uhkis, apparently :)
[14:13:00] <benighted> hey all, trying to get a div to hide/show based on selection, but by using the name as selector it is causing problems with trying to output to email. any suggestions?  http://jsbin.com/jasageduwi/1/edit
[14:13:20] <Snerf> relipse, not working on your site, I take it? have a link ?
[14:13:31] <relipse> sorry only on dev machine
[14:13:49] <Snerf> ok, nm then
[14:14:34] <relipse> what version of jqueyr started allowing data()
[14:14:40] <relipse> i keep getting undefiend
[14:14:43] <fl0w> I want to select all elements with class ‘.x-0’, com-ca: $(‘.x-0’) and toggleClass on all. How can I achieve this? The return I get aren’t jQuery objects as I can see?
[14:14:54] <Snerf> relipse, which version are you using?
[14:15:04] <relipse> how do I find out?
[14:15:06] <Uhkis> ?api data @ relipse
[14:15:07] <b-ot> relipse: .data(): Store arbitrary data associated with the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/data/
[14:15:16] <Snerf> look at your include file :)
[14:15:27] <relipse> yeah i think its my jquery is too old
[14:15:37] <relipse> thanks for the help
[14:15:45] <Uhkis> As of jQuery 1.4.3
[14:16:18] <fl0w> Hm, nvm. I’m just bad. $(‘.x-0’).toggleClass(‘my-class’); actually traversed the list :)
[14:16:31] <fl0w> That’s for over-thinking it I guess :/
[14:20:03] <relipse> i have an input type = text and i was wondering how to pulse it green for about 1 second
[14:21:32] <robertmaxrees> "pulse it green
[14:21:41] <robertmaxrees> like, a green border?
[14:23:31] <cjohnson> Snerf: ????
[14:23:54] <Snerf> cjohnson, ignore me :)
[14:24:06] <Snerf> i was sendign to the wrong person
[14:24:08] <cjohnson> ah
[14:27:31] <Otineb> hey everyone
[14:29:02] <Otineb> is there a way to extract the numeric value from an input attribute? e.g. <input onkeyup=“foo(this,28)” />. I would need “28” to return
[14:29:21] <latemus> i want to check if a variab le is set, and if not then set it to 0. is this the right way: if(!newCpuPrice) var newCpuPrice = 0;
[14:29:22] <Otineb> note I have zero control over that html. I can only use JS to interact with it.
[14:31:56] <Otineb> @latemus I think if(!newCpuPrice) returns  true/false
[14:32:20] <latemus> so i can do if(!newCpuPrice) || var newCpuPrice = 0;
[14:32:21] <Otineb> can you fiddle it?
[14:32:28] <cannap> any know how i can prevent append to remove my element?
[14:32:30] <robertmaxrees> latemus var newCpuPrice = newCpuPrice || 0;
[14:32:41] <robertmaxrees> don't use an if for this.
[14:32:41] <cannap>  $('#builder-grid').append(this); but this will removed in the html dom
[14:32:52] <latemus> robertmaxrees: ahhh ok
[14:33:00] <latemus> robertmaxrees: thanks again
[14:33:09] <Otineb> robertmaxrees is the man
[14:33:23] <latemus> Otineb: I've noticed :)
[14:33:31] <Otineb> all hail robertmaxrees
[14:33:35] <Otineb> lol
[14:33:37] <robertmaxrees> no hail D:
[14:33:45] <latemus> lol
[14:33:49] <Otineb> well we’re certainly not going to heil you
[14:34:04] <latemus> heh
[14:34:45] <phelix> If I have a php script that takes probably about an hour or so for it to run.. But just want ajax to send a command to the site to execute the script so that it can just run in the background. I don't need any return data from it.. Is that possible? Or will ajax leave the connection open the whole time until the script finishes running?
[14:34:53] <Otineb> robertmaxrees: is there a way to pull the “28” from this input html? <input onkeyup=“foo(this,28)” />
[14:35:06] <robertmaxrees> Otineb O.o
[14:35:14] <robertmaxrees> don't use event bindings like that.
[14:35:22] <Otineb> robertmaxrees: per usualy, I have no control over that html
[14:35:26] <Otineb> usual*
[14:35:33] <robertmaxrees> but if you don't have a choice, .prop('onkeyup');
[14:35:38] <robertmaxrees> that'll get you the text.
[14:35:53] <robertmaxrees> then regex
[14:35:53] <phelix> or would that be a php question?
[14:36:26] <robertmaxrees> phelix you can have your php return something that says that it kicked the job off - i'd ask in there on how to do that.
[14:37:09] <phelix> ok, so that won't have anything to do with the ajax. I can do it all with php... just have ajax basically ping the url and posts the data it needs to it and have php close it and then run in the bg?
[14:37:28] <phelix> makes sense. thanks
[14:38:28] <Otineb> robertmaxrees: so store the regex as a variable then use .match(regex-variable)?
[14:38:47] <Otineb> do i need to do anything to stringify the output? it appears to return a full function
[14:38:48] <robertmaxrees> Otineb or use a .replace();
[14:38:58] <Otineb> let me try that
[14:39:01] <robertmaxrees> Otineb that's... a little odd.
[14:40:09] <Otineb> i know right
[14:40:33] <Otineb> my life is generally a nightmare when I write JS for this system we have here
[14:41:17] <Otineb> all im trying to do is get the maxLength of an input field. Of course they dont just add maxLength to teh input. Instead they bind a validation function that passes in the maxLength defined
[14:41:49] <Otineb> now I need that value for a larger script and boy-oh-boy what a mess
[14:42:03] <Otineb> end rant
[14:42:54] <modcure> Trying to figure out how to download a dynamically created txt file retrieved from the backed via ajax call... without sbmitting a form..  any idea?
[14:43:16] <robertmaxrees> modcure that's a simple .get() call.
[14:43:21] <madprops> hi, I have an html string like "<iframe id=3> blah </iframe>" how can I turn it into a jquery object to extract the id?
[14:43:38] <robertmaxrees> madprops $('<iframe id=3> blah </iframe>').prop('id');
[14:44:12] <madprops> thanks, btw is attr deprecated?
[14:44:18] <StephenS> is it possible to not change current focus on input field, when checkbox is fired?
[14:44:36] <robertmaxrees> madprops they both work, but a little differently.
[14:44:40] <robertmaxrees> .prop() is often what you want.
[14:44:51] <modcure> robertmaxrees, how to force download of txt file ?
[14:45:18] <pilgrimish> Cork: didn’t quite get it
[14:45:22] <robertmaxrees> modcure http://stackoverflow.com/a/3749395/923919
[14:46:22] <StephenS> is it possible to not change current focus on input field, when checkbox is fired?
[14:46:23] <sammych1> [0].id ;)
[14:46:34] <robertmaxrees> StephenS you don't need to ask twice >.>
[14:46:45] <robertmaxrees> it might be.
[14:46:57] <robertmaxrees> you could trigger focus on the input again.
[14:47:03] <StephenS> indeed
[14:47:05] <StephenS> ill do that
[14:50:30] <Otineb> robertmaxrees: cant seem to get it to parse out the numbers. any ideas? I think it’s not liking the function output. http://jsfiddle.net/bsegovia/j5v3kxhw/1/
[14:51:12] <robertmaxrees> try .attr() in this case.
[14:51:14] <robertmaxrees> iiinteresting.
[14:51:15] <Otineb> k
[14:52:52] <Otineb> so i can get it if I run it through that regex twice
[14:52:53] <Otineb> http://jsfiddle.net/bsegovia/j5v3kxhw/3/
[14:53:18] <robertmaxrees> use consople.log() btw
[14:53:23] <Otineb> ok
[14:53:39] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/j5v3kxhw/4/
[14:53:42] <robertmaxrees> works fine one time.
[14:54:25] <Otineb> oh
[14:54:27] <Otineb> wth
[14:54:53] <Otineb> i swear it was returning the center of the function.
[14:54:54] <Otineb> sweet
[14:54:56] <Otineb> thanks man
[14:57:50] <StephenS> for some reason, input field, (textarea) does not focus, robertmaxrees
[14:58:51] <robertmaxrees> StephenS did you try searching google? :)
[14:59:05] <StephenS> nvm I solved it :))
[14:59:19] <StephenS> you know whats funny, when I ask question second time, I usually solve the problem in next 5 seconds
[14:59:29] <StephenS> and that happens to me so often, like in last 2 months for sure.
[14:59:40] <robertmaxrees> rubber duck debugging.
[15:01:06] <StephenS> My main JS file have 3200 lines of code, none optimized, is that too much? :(
[15:01:12] <robertmaxrees> O.o
[15:02:14] <robertmaxrees> modularize that
[15:02:30] <blackkbot> 3200 with jquery is wayy too much
[15:02:36] <blackkbot> you shouldn't need that much
[15:02:39] <robertmaxrees> eeeh...
[15:02:41] <blackkbot> how big is your page
[15:02:55] <robertmaxrees> really depends on what you're doing.
[15:02:55] <blackkbot> like thats got to be a ton of content to go with it
[15:03:30] <robertmaxrees> that's usually a symptom of a pretty featured system but no structure to the application.
[15:03:33] <ohaibbq> 3200 lines isn't a crazy amount of js, its a crazy amount of code to be in a source file tho
[15:03:45] <robertmaxrees> ^ this
[15:04:09] <StephenS> well I use a lot of libs in that file too
[15:04:10] <blackkbot> i can't really think of anything that couldn't be refactored to be way less but then again its 3200 LINES of code which i believe includes function () \n{\n....\n};
[15:04:22] <StephenS> such as typeahead twitters lib, tipsy lib, image lib etc etc
[15:04:39] <blackkbot> yeah what is your page
[15:04:49] <StephenS> a complex one :D
[15:05:50] <blackkbot> is it like 10 pages in 1 where you load a ton of ajax?
[15:06:11] <StephenS> no
[15:06:30] <robertmaxrees> blackkbot my company has some compiled files that reach into the 2500sloc range.
[15:06:37] <StephenS> on every page I load one main ajax script, but thats not anything big
[15:06:58] <robertmaxrees> it's all the extra logic and features taht people want.
[15:07:01] <robertmaxrees> everywhere.
[15:07:14] <ohaibbq> 3200 really isnt a problem, esp if its including dependencies
[15:07:31] <ohaibbq> the deps should likely be in separate files tho
[15:08:19] <robertmaxrees> depends on how you're structuring things.
[15:08:23] <blackkbot> well yeah if its all the extra stuff included.. but he made it seem like it was <script>code</script>
[15:08:36] <ohaibbq> he said it had libs in it
[15:08:43] <robertmaxrees> *using libs in it.
[15:08:49] <ohaibbq> maybe im misreading, sorry :)
[15:09:18] <robertmaxrees> his "main js file" has 3200 loc.,
[15:09:27] <robertmaxrees> and he uses a bunch of other libs/plugins in there.
[15:10:05] <blackkbot> ive done 3d rendering on a 2d canvas with less code...
[15:10:13] <robertmaxrees> so?
[15:10:22] <blackkbot> x100
[15:10:23] <robertmaxrees> apples to oranges.
[15:10:36] <robertmaxrees> sometimes what you're doing has a simple solution.
[15:10:42] <robertmaxrees> sometimes what you're doing is inherently complex.
[15:10:43] <blackkbot> this is true
[15:10:57] <blackkbot> but the person who makes it complex is you
[15:11:01] <robertmaxrees> not at all.
[15:11:05] <robertmaxrees> sometimes it's a matter of circumstance.
[15:11:29] <robertmaxrees> you could go back and simplify it, sure, but deadlines and scope are important.
[15:11:33] <blackkbot> i feel like its alll repetative tasks
[15:11:40] <blackkbot> and yeah deadlines i could see getting in the way
[15:11:49] <robertmaxrees> it's not always that way.
[15:14:39] <blackkbot> yeah i remember trying to calculate a hotel pricing page that had certain days that were 20 bucks less or something and a bunch of other rules... but i hurried through it and made it so that nobody else would want to work on it
[15:15:02] <blackkbot> ok sounds legit but id still like to see the page
[15:15:06] <robertmaxrees> lol
[15:16:17] <introspectr3> can i not abstract id's like https://dpaste.de/aw6J ?
[15:17:21] <introspectr3> i had a bunch of resetThisForm() defined, i wanted to try https://dpaste.de/aw6J but now it doens't work
[15:17:26] <blackkbot> no you can but you might need to put $("#"+name+"-form")
[15:17:33] <introspectr3> oh duh
[15:17:34] <introspectr3> ty
[15:18:08] <introspectr3> works! thanks again blackkbot
[15:18:15] <blackkbot> np
[15:21:42] <blackkbot> does jquery have a demethodizing function built into $(/*here*/) if it is passed a function?
[15:27:02] <robertmaxrees> clarify?
[15:29:07] <blackkbot> Function.bind.bind(Function.call)(Element.prototype.getAttribute)($('*[id]')[0],"id")
[15:29:16] <blackkbot> but works with arrays
[15:29:22] <robertmaxrees> what does that accomplish?
[15:29:28] <robertmaxrees> (hadn't heard of demethodizing before)
[15:29:58] <blackkbot> http://tech.pro/blog/2097/clever-way-to-demethodize-native-js-methods
[15:30:14] <blackkbot> it calls the function on the element using the element as the this
[15:31:04] <robertmaxrees> ah, so instead of test.split(",");, you have split(test,",");
[15:31:11] <blackkbot> yes
[15:31:15] <blackkbot> uncurrying
[15:31:17] <blackkbot> or something
[15:31:39] <robertmaxrees> not that i'm aware of, but that doesn't make it impossible.
[15:31:59] <blackkbot> it actually feels a lot like jquery
[15:33:15] <robertmaxrees> i guess i don't see how that's helpful in jQuery
[15:33:17] <blackkbot> because i basically reversed jquery's order of $(element/s).action to action($(element/s))
[15:33:27] <blackkbot> someone asked for it earlier
[15:33:39] <robertmaxrees> ah.  i kind of prefer chaining, depending.
[15:34:21] <blackkbot> its just defining your functions and then calling your elements on the functions rather than calling your functions based on your elements
[15:34:40] <robertmaxrees> aye - I see what the idea is.
[15:34:55] <robertmaxrees> i just don't see that as very useful in jQuery personally.
[15:35:06] <blackkbot> i don't either i was just wondering if it wasn't already in jquery
[15:35:27] <blackkbot> theres so much....
[15:35:58] <robertmaxrees> ah, nope.
[15:37:12] <blackkbot> meh i just like to program myself into knots when ive got nothing better to do
[15:56:09] <parsnip> i think there are unbalanced parentheses in the jquery file
[15:56:20] <robertmaxrees> okay.
[15:56:37] <parsnip> at http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.6.4.js
[15:56:51] <robertmaxrees> parsnip that's a very old version of jquery.
[15:56:52] <parsnip> my code folding breaks
[15:57:05] <parsnip> oh. it's in my project unfortunately
[15:57:11] <Snerf> its probably our own code breaking it
[15:57:15] <parsnip> at least the minified versioin
[15:57:19] <Snerf> your own
[15:57:21] <robertmaxrees> we're on 1.11 now.
[15:57:30] <robertmaxrees> parsnip what problem are you actually having?
[15:57:30] <parsnip> it is Emacs hs-minor-mode
[15:57:43] <parsnip> It reports unbalanced parentheses
[15:57:50] <robertmaxrees> lol
[15:57:55] <parsnip> i am tracking down the location
[15:58:03] <robertmaxrees> nobody is going to fix that.
[15:58:12] <parsnip> okay
[15:58:14] <robertmaxrees> that's not a supported version of jQuery any more.
[15:58:20] <parsnip> got it
[15:58:26] <parsnip> will edit my version
[15:58:31] <robertmaxrees> just update to a new one.
[15:58:34] <parsnip> *my copy
[15:58:43] <robertmaxrees> and ignore vendor files when checking formatting.,
[15:58:45] <parsnip> i can't take that liberty at the moment
[15:58:48] <robertmaxrees> why not?>
[15:58:59] <parsnip> it's not "my" project
[15:59:16] <robertmaxrees> put a different way - why should a vendor's code formatting be held to somebody else's standards?
[15:59:19] <parsnip> but perhaps i should suggest they update
[15:59:31] <robertmaxrees> and ignore vendor files in their format checks :)
[15:59:51] <parsnip> i'm not sure i understand, "vendor file", i'm new here
[16:00:06] <robertmaxrees> libraries/frameworks/plugins/etc.
[16:00:11] <robertmaxrees> things not written internally.
[16:00:28] <parsnip> code formatting?
[16:01:03] <robertmaxrees> right.
[16:01:32] <robertmaxrees> something tells me the code does not actually have a bug as a result of mismatched parens, but that your code format checking tool is having a hard time properly parsing something.
[16:01:50] <parsnip> i will try to check
[16:02:13] <robertmaxrees> that's kind of irrelevant to my point though - why would jquery need to match your standards and not their own?
[16:03:17] <parsnip> my standards? parentheses?
[16:03:44] <robertmaxrees> lol
[16:03:47] <robertmaxrees> where are you confused?
[16:03:53] <parsnip> i don't understand
[16:04:18] <parsnip> isn't matching parentheses generally everyone's standards?
[16:04:57] <Robdgreat> so the code is causing an error in your browser?
[16:05:05] <robertmaxrees> you think jquery core would actually have that major of a bug
[16:06:18] <parsnip> it is unminified, so maybe that is why it doesn't matter. people don't "use" unminified?
[16:06:25] <madprops> anybody know if it's possible to append a youtube iframe somewhere else without the video stopping??
[16:06:36] <Robdgreat> parsnip: sure they do
[16:06:37] <parsnip> Robdgreat: i never said that
[16:06:49] <Robdgreat> I wasn't accusing you of saying it. I was asking a question
[16:07:04] <parsnip> i said an Emacs package reports unbalanced parentheses
[16:07:08] <Robdgreat> yes.
[16:07:20] <Robdgreat> which suggests the issue is with the Emacs package
[16:07:40] <parsnip> perhaps
[16:07:41] <Robdgreat> as legitimate unbalanced parentheses would cause a parse error
[16:08:40] <AcidRain2012> jquery appears to escape malformed vectors when in a variable
[16:09:56] <AcidRain2012> this, i did not know
[16:10:23] <AcidRain2012> was worried about xss with a full jquery website, but jquery seems to handle it quite nicely
[16:10:36] <parsnip> i can do a simple character search, and i'm pretty sure there's some missing curly brackets, so i don't think it's the Emacs package
[16:10:42] <AcidRain2012> either that, or chrome is actually preventing it. but i tested in FF as well. still passes
[16:11:02] <parsnip> If I jump "up" from last closing curly bracket, I am still inside another
[16:11:21] <AcidRain2012> parsnip, this is true
[16:11:42] <AcidRain2012> jumping up from a closing } would put u inside { } :P
[16:12:19] <parsnip> the /last/ closing AcidRain2012
[16:12:59] <AcidRain2012> not sure why that would matter. i know of 0 cases where a } would not be preceded with a {
[16:13:05] <AcidRain2012> thus putting u inside { }
[16:13:31] <checkit> Hey guys... I'm having some issues getting this script to work. Essentially, I have a modal popup form. Each entry is appended to a table in the UI and the data is saved to a hidden field in the form of an array. As new entries are added I need to update tha array. I keep running into issues though. Any help would be appreciated:
[16:13:31] <checkit> http://jsbin.com/rebayibahi/1/edit?js,console,output
[16:13:39] <parsnip> i step to the left of that, and i'm still inside another opening
[16:13:44] <parsnip> like { { }
[16:14:28] <AcidRain2012> why do you have 2 {{ and 1 } ?
[16:14:42] <robertmaxrees> parsnip can you share where you think it's broken?
[16:15:14] <AcidRain2012> checkit, shouldnt it be array.push(var)
[16:15:18] <parsnip> i didn't say it's broken, i said i believe there are unbalanced parentheses
[16:15:24] <robertmaxrees> lol
[16:15:30] <robertmaxrees> can you show where you think that might be the case?
[16:15:33] <parsnip> http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.6.4.js
[16:15:38] <robertmaxrees> that's not helpful.
[16:15:40] <robertmaxrees> where in that file?
[16:15:42] <m1chael> i'd like to implement a modern jquery image pop up with forward/back buttons, and some kind of form... like facebook/instagram do when you click on a picture... any suggestions on nice scripts?
[16:16:12] <parsnip> go to the last closing bracket. use your favorite tool to jump outside of this bracket. you are still in an opening bracket, that was never closed
[16:16:15] <checkit> robertmaxrees: That's what I have in there.
[16:16:51] <AcidRain2012> m1chael, that script should be fairly ez to make. though i wouldnt use a popup window. i would use a css with border shadows that make it appear to be a popup centered in the screen
[16:16:56] <robertmaxrees> sounds like a formatting quirk, checkit
[16:17:02] <parsnip> backward-up-list is built in to Emacs, find the bug
[16:17:13] <robertmaxrees> lol i don't use emacs sooo
[16:17:19] <parsnip> that's your problem
[16:17:23] <robertmaxrees> woah
[16:17:28] <parsnip> i'm kidding
[16:17:35] <AcidRain2012> lol
[16:17:58] <checkit> robertmaxrees: Is there a better way to go about what I explained?
[16:17:58] <AcidRain2012> checkit, then u know, animate the next image depending on if u click left or right
[16:18:05] <AcidRain2012> i may code that real quick. sounds fun =D
[16:18:15] <parsnip> jeez, y'all hate me now, i'm going to leave with only my integrity intact
[16:18:18] <robertmaxrees> nah.
[16:18:20] <robertmaxrees> no hate.
[16:18:29] <parsnip> viva la emacs
[16:18:48] <robertmaxrees> you're just making an interesting claim about a very out-of-date version of jquery.
[16:18:56] <robertmaxrees> so i'm not sure what you're expecting.
[16:19:13] <checkit> robertmaxrees: ?
[16:19:30] <parsnip> nothing, come to find out. now i understand that it is out of date.
[16:19:32] <robertmaxrees> checkit huh?
[16:19:43] <robertmaxrees> checkit i haven't looked at your issue yet...
[16:19:57] <robertmaxrees> parsnip alright
[16:19:57] <parsnip> and that i had better produce a perl script next time to support my claim
[16:20:02] <checkit> My bad. I thought you were talking to me robertmaxrees
[16:20:22] <parsnip> thanks all, till next time
[16:20:34] <robertmaxrees> parsnip the file gets concated from a bunch of smaller files - i'll guess there are some formatting quirks tripping up however that thing is verifying syntax.
[16:23:46] <parsnip> even backward-up-list? i'm skeptical
[16:24:10] <parsnip> quirks? you mean unbalanced parentheses?
[16:24:45] <robertmaxrees> lol
[16:24:49] <robertmaxrees> you're really stuck on this.
[16:25:18] <parsnip> me? you're the one stuck on claiming there are not unbalanced parentheses
[16:25:23] <parsnip> 1 2 3 ...
[16:25:25] <parsnip> let's drop it
[16:25:27] <robertmaxrees> then there would be a parse error on the file...
[16:25:31] <robertmaxrees> that's my entire point.
[16:25:38] <parsnip> can you parse it?
[16:26:15] <parsnip> and do you know if a parse will fail on unbalanced parentheses?
[16:26:26] <cjohnson> yes.
[16:26:49] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/z752cyeb/ parses and runs fine.
[16:27:15] <SNAFUdowser> Is there a way to get the element by index in cycle2?
[16:28:39] <parsnip> okay, then you are starting to convince me that i should shut up until i can provide better proof. and that it is not important, so i will get to that when i need to or if i learn perl.
[16:29:27] <robertmaxrees> i'm not trying to be a jerk - if that's the impression you got, i apologize
[16:29:33] <parsnip> s/are starting to convince/have convinced/
[16:29:54] <parsnip> no no, i just thought i was right, so i sounded like that
[16:30:36] <robertmaxrees> if you ever think you've found a bug in jquery, feel free to submit a ticket via github and/or head over to #jquery-dev and talk to them.
[16:30:46] <blackkbot> console.log($.fn.each(function(){$(this)($('*'))})); hey it is almost backwards
[16:31:12] <parsnip> by the way, i have many questions about jquery, so i will definitely be back. none of them are solidifying yet.
[16:31:19] <robertmaxrees> :)
[16:31:20] <robertmaxrees> it's all good.
[16:33:03] <cjohnson> blackkbot you are evil
[16:33:08] <cjohnson> stop this madness
[16:33:33] <blackkbot> evil good? :)
[17:07:19] <parsnip> does this sound generally right? i mean, is the following typical?
[17:07:28] <parsnip> load order is:
[17:08:07] <parsnip> require.min.js; main.js; app.js; require.min.js
[17:08:26] <parsnip> oops, last should by jquery.min.js
[17:08:27] <robertmaxrees> why not use require to load everything?
[17:08:34] <robertmaxrees> that's what its for.
[17:09:18] <parsnip> Sorry, i'm just looking at Network tab of dev tool.
[17:09:40] <robertmaxrees> jquery should probably load before main and app.
[17:09:46] <robertmaxrees> if they rely on it.
[17:10:10] <parsnip> even according to Network tab? I may be misinterpreting.
[17:10:35] <robertmaxrees> are you having bugs or something?
[17:10:42] <parsnip> In other words, jquery should be the most independent of the three?
[17:10:50] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[17:10:54] <parsnip> no, just trying to "read" the source
[17:10:56] <robertmaxrees> jquery should load before the other two.
[17:10:59] <jotterbot> is there an easy way to calculate a 2 pass percentage bar? where pass 1 is from 0-50% and pass 2 is from 50%-100%. Both passes are outputting from 0-100 percent though. ?
[17:11:01] <robertmaxrees> because they likely rely onb it.
[17:11:13] <parsnip> okay, thank you, i will watch out for that
[17:11:25] <robertmaxrees> parsnip but you shouldn't need to worry about it.
[17:11:33] <robertmaxrees> require should be handling all of that for you.
[17:12:18] <robertmaxrees> ie - don't worry about the network tab unless you have a reason to.
[17:12:21] <parsnip> okay, yeah it's slowly sinking in what to pay attention to and what to "ignore"
[17:12:48] <parsnip> well, i use the network tab to eliminate which files i should dig through
[17:13:09] <robertmaxrees> learning where and how things are loaded?
[17:13:12] <parsnip> if the action has happenned, and Network hasn't loaded a file, i can ignore that ons
[17:13:49] <robertmaxrees> interesting way to look at it.
[17:14:04] <parsnip> haha, i'm very adhoc right now
[17:14:28] <parsnip> i can't afford to understand entire codebase at the moment
[17:14:56] <parsnip> jquery was a red herring, now i know it is a blackbox and roughly what it is for
[17:15:29] <parsnip> that's why i was chasing unminified, when really, i should have been googling, "what is jquery.js" etc
[17:16:09] <robertmaxrees> are you trying to fix somethin?
[17:16:12] <robertmaxrees> *something?
[17:16:40] <parsnip> i'm trying to mimic something with an external call
[17:16:59] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[17:17:06] <parsnip> so i have to narrow down the essence of that action to abstract it away from the webpage
[17:17:10] <robertmaxrees> what are you trying to mimic?
[17:17:20] <parsnip> the action of a restart button
[17:17:41] <parsnip> how that restart button is built
[17:17:52] <parsnip> it's calling the database, etc
[17:17:58] <robertmaxrees> from front to bad?
[17:17:59] <robertmaxrees> *back
[17:18:06] <parsnip> front to back?
[17:18:11] <robertmaxrees> from the frontend to the backend?
[17:18:23] <parsnip> client to server?
[17:18:27] <robertmaxrees> correct
[17:18:47] <parsnip> oh yeah, back and forth til i find everything we need
[17:19:11] <parsnip> i am an amateur detective for the week
[17:19:20] <robertmaxrees> depending, I might start looking for event bindings for that button.
[17:19:26] <robertmaxrees> or, if it's in a form, bindings on the form.
[17:19:47] <parsnip> oh, the onclick=...
[17:19:58] <robertmaxrees> or code using addEventListener.
[17:19:59] <robertmaxrees> or .on()
[17:20:07] <robertmaxrees> or any number of other jquery methods.
[17:20:13] <parsnip> yes, i have the function, i expect some of that will be easy
[17:20:35] <parsnip> but when the page loads, it builds the rows and buttons with data
[17:21:17] <robertmaxrees> without seeing it, it'd hard to offer advice, but you sound like you know where to start roughly.
[17:21:45] <parsnip> and i see some js files that have 'select .... *'
[17:21:59] <robertmaxrees> wut
[17:22:02] <robertmaxrees> like, sql statements?
[17:22:08] <parsnip> Thank you. Yes, I just keep trying to put together little facts.
[17:22:09] <morenoh150> how can I load jquery into a random site I'm browsing?
[17:22:16] <robertmaxrees> morenoh150 a plugin.
[17:22:27] <morenoh150> robertmaxrees: such as?
[17:22:31] <robertmaxrees> what browser?
[17:22:40] <morenoh150> ah so extensions?
[17:22:49] <morenoh150> I also found this bookmarklet http://www.learningjquery.com/2009/04/better-stronger-safer-jquerify-bookmarklet/
[17:22:50] <parsnip> Yes, sql is somewhere is in there. i don't think that would be hard to write, but i need to connect the dots of the current processs
[17:23:00] <robertmaxrees> morenoh150 samediff.  what are you trying to do with it, morenoh150?
[17:23:25] <robertmaxrees> parsnip you shouldn't have sql in your javascript files unless those files are used by the server with something like node.js
[17:23:32] <morenoh150> robertmaxrees: just want something I can direct students to
[17:23:39] <robertmaxrees> morenoh150 okay
[17:24:11] <morenoh150> jquery-injector any good?
[17:24:15] <robertmaxrees> no clue.
[17:25:39] <morenoh150> jquery-injector is pretty good
[17:25:44] <robertmaxrees> i don't use chrome and don't usually need to inject jquery into sites.
[17:26:17] <robertmaxrees> so i wouldn't really know
[17:26:45] <morenoh150> I think letting a student be able to go to random sites and modify the dom is an amazing learning opportunity
[17:26:52] <parsnip> robertmaxrees: it may have been in a php file, it all starts to blur together sometimes.
[17:26:59] <robertmaxrees> it could be, though that's not really teaching very much imo, morenoh150
[17:27:13] <robertmaxrees> parsnip i'd start writing things down with pen and paper
[17:27:59] <parsnip> agreed
[18:50:38] <modcure> Trying to figure out how to download a dynamically created txt file retrieved from the backed via ajax call... without sbmitting a form..  any idea?
[19:33:28] <cjohnson> I want to retrieve the element that is visually highest on a page from a jquery collection. I'm using something like: $collection.sort(function(a, b) { a = $(a).offset().top, b = $(b).offset().top; ... comparison ...})[0]
[19:33:47] <cjohnson> anybody have any suggestions for how I might cache .offset().top calls?
[19:35:54] <cjohnson> or am I over thinking it
[19:57:41] <chameleonrising> hello, I am a new member
[19:59:49] <Snerf> ola!
[20:58:01] <AcidRain2012> how can i get the next child element to a clicked elements text whos class is 'title'
[20:58:03] <AcidRain2012> $(this).child('section .title"]').text();
[20:58:52] <cjohnson> find
[20:59:14] <cjohnson> $(this).find('.title') will find the first matching child of this whose class is title
[20:59:23] <cjohnson> will find all matching children*
[20:59:29] <cjohnson> so then .get(0) to get the first one of that
[20:59:35] <cjohnson> or first
[20:59:54] <cjohnson> $(this).find('.title').first() for instance
[21:09:44] <AcidRain2012> i just cant get it to work :/
[21:10:15] <cjohnson> what can't you get to work
[21:10:21] <cjohnson> try to reduce your use case to a jsfiddle
[21:11:08] <cjohnson> even if it's as simple as putting an example HTML structure and just explaining in plain english what you want
[21:12:11] <AcidRain2012> k hang on
[21:13:02] <cjohnson> here's how I understood what you wanted http://jsfiddle.net/qtg87kax/1/
[21:16:33] <AcidRain2012> http://jsfiddle.net/fkLydshq/ i tried my best, cant get the jquery on there to fire
[21:18:22] <cjohnson> you have a syntax error
[21:18:28] <cjohnson> on line 6
[21:18:39] <cjohnson> you forgot to close the parens for your delegate call
[21:20:17] <cjohnson> you also need to e.preventDefault(); or return false; to stop the links from trying to load
[21:20:37] <cjohnson> any reason you're using .delegate instead of .on?
[21:20:38] <AcidRain2012> ok fixed. http://jsfiddle.net/fkLydshq/2/
[21:21:12] <AcidRain2012> well, all the jquery is much more complex. about 100 lines so far, i just took out the parts in question
[21:21:21] <cjohnson> sure but just in general
[21:21:32] <cjohnson> if you have no reason not to, I would use .on
[21:21:36] <cjohnson> .delegate is deprecated
[21:21:44] <AcidRain2012> oh rly?
[21:21:47] <AcidRain2012> :)
[21:21:54] <cjohnson> behavior is the same, just swap the first 2 args
[21:21:59] <cjohnson> .on('click', 'a', function...
[21:22:21] <AcidRain2012> alright cool. i just updated that in my server script
[21:22:30] <AcidRain2012> but do u see what im saying? u get a blank popup
[21:22:34] <AcidRain2012> where updatetitle should be
[21:22:35] <cjohnson> sweet. now the last issue is just that your selector logic is wrong
[21:22:59] <cjohnson> so this really depends. assuming your markup is always like what you have in this example...
[21:23:43] <AcidRain2012> well that is a concern, it may not always be like that. however i know that a section class="title" will not occur again
[21:23:51] <AcidRain2012> i mean it will, but not to mess this up
[21:24:20] <cjohnson> well it's hard to say. we would have to know how the code varies
[21:24:24] <cjohnson> http://jsfiddle.net/fkLydshq/5/
[21:25:02] <cjohnson> the approach here is to find a parent that both the link and the .title share
[21:25:05] <AcidRain2012> actually im sry, i just confused myself. the posted example is how it will occur always, repeating the whole content
[21:25:10] <cjohnson> but one which doesn't contain any other .titles
[21:25:21] <cjohnson> in this case, section.header
[21:25:36] <cjohnson> so we select the parent section.header via $(this).closest('section.header')
[21:25:43] <cjohnson> then find the .title inside it with .find('.title')
[21:25:50] <AcidRain2012> let me check this
[21:26:08] <AcidRain2012> excellent, exactlly what im looking for
[21:26:57] <cjohnson> great
[21:27:32] <AcidRain2012> explains alot now. i was trying children and contents() :P
[21:27:59] <cjohnson> the .children in your first attempt was redundant
[21:28:21] <cjohnson> $(this).find('.foo') finds children of this with class=foo
[21:29:05] <cjohnson> this refers to the link
[21:29:13] <cjohnson> so obviously there were no titles inside the link
[21:42:33] <AcidRain2012> cjohnson, best thing i can tell u is this: http://acidshower.com:81/inventory/      user: helpme pass: 11111   -> admin -> edit updates
[21:44:32] <AcidRain2012> not sure what is going on. same layout
[21:45:06] <AcidRain2012> perhaps this whole idea im trying to do just isnt going to work
[21:47:56] <AcidRain2012> nah. that was stupid thought. the event is firing. so. still something im missing
[21:49:20] <AcidRain2012> i may see. all of this content is generated by php. the links are delgated. but not the section header
[21:53:43] <cjohnson> don't see that code
[21:54:29] <cjohnson> it's pretty terrible that you load the interior of the page via ajax btw
[21:54:39] <cjohnson> breaks all links / SEO and stops bookmarking or sharing links
[21:54:57] <cjohnson> at least should be manipulating the history or using #hash URLs
[21:56:07] <cjohnson> if I right click Edit Updates and "copy link" and paste that link into my browser I get a 404, etc
[21:56:15] <LuciusSir> I got a neat one for you
[21:56:51] <LuciusSir> so I call .hover from inside a function(controlname) ,   it works on one of the elements the listener is applied to, but only that one
[21:57:07] <LuciusSir> does that seem like bug or could there be something else ?
[21:57:34] <cjohnson> need more details LuciusSir
[21:59:29] <LuciusSir> http://pastebin.com/QqcLD1Cu
[22:00:29] <LuciusSir> cjohnson:  there it is :)
[22:01:56] <AcidRain2012> cjohnson, i believe you are right
[22:03:50] <LuciusSir> what did he say ?
[22:03:53] <LuciusSir> :P
[22:08:32] <LuciusSir> cjohnson:  weird, it always seems that the last button in the div is the one that gets it, I tried it with buttons in another div and the same symptom, the .hover does not take to any of the previous buttons, only the last one in the div
[22:08:52] <cjohnson> I don't see HoverIn defined?
[22:09:02] <cjohnson> or HoverOut? and I'm not sure what you expect that the syntax of .hover() is?
[22:09:14] <cjohnson> I don't think you're using it right
[22:09:25] <LuciusSir> oh crap
[22:09:27] <LuciusSir> one sec
[22:09:43] <cjohnson> $foo.hover(func) binds func as an event listener for the hover event on $foo
[22:09:48] <cjohnson> it doesn't trigger anything
[22:10:24] <LuciusSir> http://pastebin.com/QZ98YYUy
[22:10:30] <LuciusSir> sorry i forgot to add them to the pastebin
[22:10:46] <LuciusSir> cjohnson: there you go :)
[22:12:00] <cjohnson> well alright
[22:12:29] <LuciusSir> yeah...  its confusing as to why it doesn't work.
[22:12:38] <LuciusSir> if you add links to two different divs
[22:12:47] <cjohnson> I still don't even know what the issue is yet
[22:12:51] <cjohnson> can you make a usable fiddle?
[22:12:58] <cjohnson> hard to guess at what you mean is going on
[22:13:01] <LuciusSir> sure
[22:17:13] <cjohnson> why do you have $('#' + control) and $('#cont' + control)
[22:17:16] <cjohnson> is that intentional?
[22:18:19] <LuciusSir> yes
[22:18:24] <LuciusSir> one is the control you name
[22:18:29] <LuciusSir> the other is the new wrapping div
[22:18:47] <cjohnson> k. just guessing at possible problems
[22:19:22] <LuciusSir> ermm does jfiddle use .ready or .load ?
[22:19:36] <LuciusSir> or do i have to put a script tag in the html ?
[22:22:23] <cjohnson> read the labels on the 4 panels ;)
[22:22:34] <cjohnson> it puts the JS in the <head> by default I believe
[22:22:52] <cjohnson> oh nope onLoad -- see the dropdown on the top left
[22:22:59] <cjohnson> (you can also load jquery with the dropdown above it)
[22:23:05] <LuciusSir> cjohnson:  http://jsfiddle.net/avb6qo33/
[22:23:22] <LuciusSir> there it is, you'll see th exact problem when you hover over each button
[22:24:43] <LuciusSir> cjohnson:  for whatever reason the .hover listener is not showing up on all the divs
[22:25:21] <cjohnson> what is all this stuff you're doing in the middle of MakeButton
[22:25:42] <cjohnson> can you break it down in simple english what you're trying to accomplish?
[22:26:00] <cjohnson> like "wrap the given <a> tag in a <div> that changes border color on hover"
[22:26:50] <LuciusSir> cjohnson:  wrap the <a> tag in a div, style the div, add a dropshadow to the div, add a hover event handler to highlight the div
[22:29:21] <cjohnson> what is this lastelement stuff meant to be fore?
[22:30:04] <LuciusSir> cjohnson: to determine where to insert the new div
[22:32:29] <SNAFUdowser> Hey, anyone familiar with cycle2 and can help me figure out why when I remove an element from my slider it behaves so strangely?  Snerf, I found some issues with the code and still haven't figured it out.   This is the site that has the sliders: http://loverock.nextmp.net/lrny/dyor.html and here is the JS behind it: http://pastebin.com/0LiwiyaK
[22:32:35] <SNAFUdowser> You can see the error if you go to the site, increment the 3rd slider (from the top) once, and then increment the 2nd slider twice.  It is deleting the first element of the band slider if you move it over once, and it is also make it not slide correctly. Any help will be appreciated more than you know.
[22:33:24] <LuciusSir> SNAFUdowser:  you ought to look at the on e we're looking at
[22:34:15] <dheerajchand> Hello, all, first-timer. Can someone here recommend a jQuery tutorial for someone who’s fairly fluent in Python and server-side JavaScript? I’ve worked with some data visualisation JS libraries like D3, HighCharts, Leaflet and Open Layers, too.
[22:34:17] <SNAFUdowser> LuciusSir: The on e?  Sorry don't know what you mean.
[22:34:24] <LuciusSir> SNAFUdowser:  http://jsfiddle.net/avb6qo33/
[22:34:36] <cjohnson> he's looking for his own help LuciusSir ;)
[22:34:46] <LuciusSir> SNAFUdowser:  I think its a bug in jquery
[22:34:53] <LuciusSir> cjohnson:  ^
[22:35:00] <cjohnson> your code is a mess LuciusSir so I'm rewriting what I think you want
[22:35:02] <cjohnson> just a sec
[22:35:13] <LuciusSir> cjohnson:  is not :(
[22:37:16] <cjohnson> haha it really is
[22:37:48] <LuciusSir> cjohnson:  nuh uh.. anyway, I changed the hove event to mouseout and mouseover seperately, same problem only the last div created in the parnet div gets the listener
[22:37:59] <cjohnson> I don't think the .hover is your issue
[22:38:05] <cjohnson> it's the really convoluted way you're doing it
[22:38:16] <cjohnson> you could basically replace most of that function with something like this:
[22:38:20] <cjohnson>     button = button.replaceWith(container);
[22:38:25] <cjohnson>     container.append(button);
[22:38:42] <cjohnson> where container = $('<div id="cont-' + id + '">')
[22:38:53] <LuciusSir> cjohnson:  seriously dude, in google chrome inspect each element, the mouseover, mouseout events only take on the last child of the parent div
[22:39:06] <LuciusSir> and ok i will try that real quick, but if its not the problem :P I told you so LOL
[22:39:08] <cjohnson> it's your binding that is the issue
[22:40:01] <LuciusSir> cjohnson:  fyi, i used annoymous event handlers too,  it really shouldn't make any difference though
[22:40:45] <cjohnson> again, that's not the issue
[22:40:47] <cjohnson> it's the code above it
[22:40:47] <LuciusSir> cjohnson:  the end result after doing my convoluted stuff is that there exists a new dom element right where i want it, i apply a hover event to it and for some reason its not taking on the last child in each parent div...
[22:40:53] <cjohnson> the .hover line seems fine
[22:40:54] <LuciusSir> show me
[22:41:00] <cjohnson> http://jsfiddle.net/sg931d7w/
[22:41:48] <cjohnson> hah, jquery already has a .wrap method even
[22:41:50] <LuciusSir> cjohnson:  add display:inline to the divs
[22:41:57] <cjohnson> do it yourself
[22:41:59] <LuciusSir> cjohnson:  i didn't know sorry lol
[22:42:12] <cjohnson> I'm just demonstrating how your code should work basically
[22:42:38] <LuciusSir> cjohnson:  yeah the weird thing is though.... lemme check something
[22:42:58] <cjohnson> here we go using jquery.wrap:     button.wrap(container);
[22:43:04] <cjohnson> http://jsfiddle.net/sg931d7w/2/
[22:43:05] <cjohnson> rather
[22:43:30] <LuciusSir> weird "this." kept throwing undefined for me
[22:43:50] <cjohnson> then you were using it wrong or in the wrong place ;)
[22:45:22] <LuciusSir> weird...
[22:45:29] <LuciusSir> so if i define an outside function like i did
[22:45:36] <LuciusSir> would this effectively be the same ?
[22:45:40] <LuciusSir> also what does prop do ?
[22:45:52] <cjohnson> changes properties of a jquery node
[22:45:56] <LuciusSir> ohhh its the same as attr
[22:46:02] <LuciusSir> i like attr better :P
[22:46:08] <cjohnson> no, it's not the same
[22:46:15] <cjohnson> it updates the properties, not the HTML attributes
[22:46:32] <LuciusSir> doesn't that end up being the same thing ?
[22:46:34] <cjohnson> you should almost always be using prop unless you have a specific reason to be setting the attributes
[22:46:48] <cjohnson> it can, sometimes. but in no way guaranteed
[22:47:04] <cjohnson> "if I define an outside function like I did" meaning what now?
[22:47:04] <LuciusSir> but i'm using attribute names though right ?
[22:47:10] <cjohnson> yes same names
[22:47:16] <LuciusSir> function HoverIn()
[22:47:19] <LuciusSir> for example
[22:47:21] <cjohnson> ohh yeah
[22:47:26] <cjohnson> container.hover(HoverIn, HoverOut) would work
[22:47:44] <LuciusSir> and the 'this' keyword inside it would reference the container ?
[22:47:48] <cjohnson> like I said, your .hover bit was fine ;)
[22:47:58] <cjohnson> yes, though I think event.target like you have will work the same
[22:48:15] <LuciusSir> cool
[22:48:21] <LuciusSir> well i thank you very much me friend :)
[22:48:25] <cjohnson> no prob
[22:48:56] <LuciusSir> i shall now be going to bed :)
[22:49:14] <cjohnson> goodnight
[22:53:20] <SNAFUdowser> cjohnson: You don't happen to know anything about cycle2?  Lol although I think I'm starting to figure out what my issue might be... I've been hitting my head against a brick wall for days which I think has degraded my critical thinking.
[22:54:01] <cjohnson> nope not a bit
[22:54:51] <cjohnson> dheerajchand: learn.jquery.com seems to be recommended in here often
[22:54:52] <SNAFUdowser> lol darn
[22:59:33] <dheerajchand> Thanks!
[23:04:31] <thegrid> im seeing .instance, can anyne tell me abut this?
[23:05:19] <thegrid> has anyone ever done jquery.sheet ?
[23:25:43] <parsnip> why is this ajax file not visible from dev tools?
[23:27:22] <cjohnson> wat
[23:31:43] <parsnip> there is an ajax file reference in the source code, and it exists on the server, but it doesn't show up in resources
[23:32:00] <parsnip> like, my_ajax.php
[23:32:31] <cjohnson> "file reference in the source code" how?
[23:32:40] <cjohnson> paste some code
[23:33:14] <cjohnson> ajax requests should show up in the network tab. you may have a filter enabled btw
[23:33:28] <cjohnson> make sure you select the type of request you're looking for. or all.
[23:34:09] <parsnip> var AJAX_SCRIPT = '/my_ajax.php';
[23:34:36] <parsnip> and my_ajax.php shows up in Network, so it is part of the process.
[23:34:51] <parsnip> *Netword tab of chrome dev tools
[23:34:57] <parsnip> *Network
[23:35:11] <ul71m0> Hi guys, i have this navigation menu, and i want to clone parent link to be first option on its children list. something like this http://jsfiddle.net/w5v9p477/ but i still dont know how to wrap it to <li></li> and put it on top
[23:35:22] <parsnip> But it doesn't show in Sources TAB
[23:35:59] <parsnip> sorry, not sure why i asked on #jquery
[23:36:15] <cjohnson> ul71m0: http://api.jquery.com/wrap/ you can use .wrap('<li>') to wrap a node in an <li>
[23:37:02] <cjohnson> it will return the original element though, so if you want to keep a reference to the li you'll want to create it on another line
[23:37:40] <ul71m0> cjohnson: i did it here http://jsfiddle.net/w5v9p477/1/ but i want to put it on top of the list
[23:38:05] <cjohnson> var li = $('<li>'); /* event handlers or css or whatever */ $node.wrap(li); $ul.prepend(li);
[23:40:10] <ul71m0> cjohnson: not sure that i got it, but let me try it in fiddle
[23:40:28] <cjohnson> cool, let me know
[23:46:41] <ul71m0> cjohnson: almost done, i just need to limit it only to next children http://jsfiddle.net/w5v9p477/3/
[23:46:51] <ul71m0> i tried with .next and .closest but no luck
[23:49:07] <cjohnson> you could do .closest('li').first('.children')
[23:49:09] <cjohnson> from the link
[23:49:28] <cjohnson> I think that's what you mean?
[23:52:28] <ul71m0> hmm got it working on some dirty way http://jsfiddle.net/w5v9p477/4/ im sure it can be nicer but this works ;)
[23:52:42] <cjohnson> oh also you want to do the wrap before prepending I believe
