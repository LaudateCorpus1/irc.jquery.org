[00:04:56] <Damiano> guys
[00:05:00] <Damiano> i have jQuery(".lista_anno a").on("click", function(event){ ... }
[00:05:22] <Damiano> and <table><tr><td class="lista_anno"><a href=""></a></td></tr></table>
[00:05:32] <Damiano> how is this possible that i do not intercept the link ?
[00:07:21] <diverdude> Eviltwin: ImBcmDth: hmmm yeah ok i see. I made the same situation here: http://jsfiddle.net/eK6Pg/6/ just very simplified. The reason i bind the handlers every time is because i need access to that id. How can i then do that without rebinding the handlers?
[00:08:29] <Juanlajara> did you e.preventDefault() on the a? have you tried $('td.lista_anno>a') ?
[00:11:12] <Damiano> Juanlajara, wait i test the second
[00:11:13] <diverdude> Eviltwin: this shows it even more clearly: http://jsfiddle.net/eK6Pg/8/
[00:13:31] <Damiano> Juanlajara, nothing....it does not work
[00:13:40] <Damiano> <a href="#">
[00:13:43] <Damiano> maybe the --> # ?
[00:14:06] <Damiano> i load the table with AJAX
[00:14:14] <timkofu> hi guys
[00:14:26] <timkofu> anyone familiar with gmap3?
[00:15:47] <Juanlajara> why don't you try a class with the a element, i.e.: <a class='item' href="#"></a> ?
[00:15:57] <mindis|wurk> Damiano jquery basics: you can't use dynamically changed content like that. you need to do something like $(tablesstaticparent).on('click', 'a', function(event) { event.preventDefault(); });
[00:16:11] <jonkersjoe> hi is there a plugin that will allow a user to generate css styles much like http://www.cssportal.com/css-style-editor/ ?
[00:16:29] <Juanlajara> but assuming that you can't i will
[00:16:36] <Juanlajara> try to jsfiddle
[00:16:48] <Juanlajara> yep try to rebind listeners when loading new content
[00:17:21] <Damiano> Juanlajara, sure i tried "lista_anno" in the a elements
[00:17:37] <Damiano> mindis|wurk, i need something like live() but it is deprecated on 1.7
[00:18:38] <mindis|wurk> Damiano on() pretty much replaces live() but the way you use it is slightly different as i demonstrated above
[00:18:39] <Juanlajara> well the fastest solution could be bind the listeners on the success event of the ajax loading
[00:18:52] <Whirl3d_> jonkersjoe, that rocks
[00:19:21] <Damiano> mindis|wurk, i try
[00:19:30] <Damiano> mindis|wurk, but what do you mean with tablestaticparent?
[00:19:32] <Damiano> can i write
[00:19:40] <Damiano> 'table' there because it is a <table> ?
[00:19:52] <mindis|wurk> it's the closest static parent for the table
[00:20:41] <jonkersjoe> Whirl3d_:  yeah it does, i tried to look at qrone.org to see if I can purchase the code and couldn't find them
[00:21:25] <Damiano> mindis|wurk, does not work
[00:21:32] <mindis|wurk> you're doing it wrong
[00:21:36] <mindis|wurk> basics basics
[00:21:44] <FJ1> can somebody say if this https://github.com/isocra/TableDnD/issues/10Â is an jquery or a plugin problem?
[00:21:44] <socialhapy> â˜… Issue #10 on TableDnD (FlashJunior; 12m, 51s ago): Problem with jQuery 1.8 (pre version)
[00:22:29] <Damiano> mindis|wurk,  take a look at the code i get from ajax: https://gist.github.com/2964377
[00:22:58] <mindis|wurk> yep, a normal table
[00:23:04] <Damiano> mindis|wurk, and this is the jquery https://gist.github.com/2964378
[00:23:10] <Damiano> stop...what is wrong?? :-(
[00:23:23] <mindis|wurk> you're assigning it to the table, not its static parent
[00:24:01] <Damiano> mindis|wurk, so? 'body' ?
[00:24:15] <mindis|wurk> well, uh, if that's the closest one
[00:24:27] <Damiano> ok
[00:24:53] <Damiano> mindis|wurk, but to understand it wel... with STATIC do you mean an element NOT loaded from AJAX (in a second time) right?
[00:25:20] <mindis|wurk> yes. an element that is present on document load and that doesn't get replaced or removed
[00:25:33] <mindis|wurk> in another words, it's static
[00:25:40] <mindis|wurk> whereas your table is dynamic
[00:26:33] <Damiano> ooook
[00:26:36] <Damiano> works :D
[00:26:37] <Damiano> eheheh
[00:26:47] <Damiano> now i have to get the title of the link
[00:26:57] <Damiano> with ''this'' i can get it easly
[00:27:09] <mindis|wurk> yep. $(this).attr('title')
[00:27:40] <jonkersjoe> ok found them and they have a CPL license which is good
[00:28:36] <Damiano> mindis|wurk, i think it is the same with .text()
[00:28:38] <Damiano> no?
[00:29:18] <mindis|wurk> title is a named html attribute, text returns the text content of the element
[00:33:09] <Damiano> okù
[00:35:06] <granden> string comparission in jquery is it normal, ==?
[00:35:21] <granden> variable == "string"
[00:35:52] <mindis|wurk> yes, it's plain javascript and has nothing to do with jquery :)
[00:36:58] <granden> I more thought if jquery had any strcmp function like php
[00:37:13] <coldhead> you probably want php.js
[00:37:24] <coldhead> http://phpjs.org/
[00:37:24] <granden> What no? Why?
[00:37:52] <granden> I'm fine using regular js.
[00:38:10] <granden> oh, it gots a lot of functions.
[00:38:24] <granden> Thanks for the tips, that will probably save me a lot of time in the future!
[00:38:47] <coldhead> good luck granden
[00:41:04] <coldhead> WHY IS OUR BABY SO BAD AT JENGA
[00:41:31] <Whirl3d_> baby spanx!
[00:42:09] <granden> coldhead: Thanks!
[00:50:04] <coldhead> It is amusing to view the unparalleled embarrassment of a harassed pedlar while gauging the symmetry of a peeled pear under a cemetery wall.
[00:51:50] <timkofu> anyone familiar with gmap3?
[00:51:51] <Whirl3d_> I was just saying that to shoky the other day...
[00:52:10] <timkofu> I need to create a cluster that's *exactly* like this one http://google-maps-utility-library-v3.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/markerclusterer/examples/simple_example.html
[00:59:58] <Whirl3d_> timkofu, have you looked at the source?
[01:00:33] <timkofu> I have to do that?
[01:00:43] <Whirl3d_> lolol
[01:00:48] <timkofu> heh
[01:01:02] <timkofu> I was hopind the plugin is complete
[01:01:36] <timkofu> I can always use markerClusterer, but was hoping to keep everything jQuery
[01:02:06] <juha_> ..
[01:03:06] <Nece228> hello
[01:03:10] <Nece228> i have very long selector
[01:03:16] <Nece228> how to seperate it with lines
[01:03:21] <Nece228> to make it more readable
[01:04:00] <Whirl3d_> lol
[01:04:06] <Whirl3d_> what is your selector?
[01:04:20] <Whirl3d_> chances are it doesn't need to be that long
[01:05:24] <Nece228> believe me its long
[01:05:37] <Nece228> $('<tr id="'+ val.product_id +'"><td><input type="text" id="productname" name="productname['+ val.product_id +','+ val.order_id +']" value="' + val.name + '"></input></td><td><input id="productprice" class="numberinput" name="productprice" type="text" value="' + val.price + '"></input></td><td><input type="text" id="productquantity" class="numberinput" value="'+ val.quantity +'"></input></td><td><input type="text" id="productsum" value="'+ val.
[01:05:39] <Nece228> quantity * val.price +'" disabled></input></td><td><button id="deletebutton" value="'+ val.product_id +'">Delete Entry</button></td></tr>').appendTo('table')
[01:05:44] <Nece228> sorry for flooding
[01:05:50] <Nece228> but its that long
[01:06:02] <Whirl3d_> that is not a valid selector
[01:06:07] <Whirl3d_> you shouldn't be using that
[01:06:19] <mindis|wurk> indeed, that's just rubbish
[01:06:32] <Nece228> so i should put all the text in variable and later do $(var)?
[01:06:32] <Whirl3d_> what are  you trying to select?
[01:06:48] <Whirl3d_> no! what are you trying to select?
[01:07:36] <Nece228> im basically outputting the loop
[01:07:48] <Whirl3d_> wait, you aren't trying to select anything...you are creating an html element that you want to append to something....
[01:07:52] <Nece228> i select the text and append it
[01:08:05] <Nece228> yeah
[01:08:13] <Whirl3d_> that's different
[01:08:33] <Whirl3d_> you would do var selectionHTML=.......
[01:08:36] <Nece228> im craeting html element
[01:09:01] <Whirl3d_> that's different than selecting an element
[01:09:26] <Whirl3d_> but none the less, you put the html string in a varialbe
[01:09:58] <Whirl3d_> then create the element by wrapping jQuery around it like $(htmlVariable);
[01:10:23] <Nece228>  <Nece228> so i should put all the text in variable and later do $(var)?
[01:10:29] <Whirl3d_> I apologize, I thought your were trying to select an element in the dom that was buried deep in atable. LOL
[01:10:42] <Nece228> well its my poor coding skills
[01:10:54] <Whirl3d_> Naw, it's just semantics, really.
[01:10:58] <Nece228> i guess nobody creates html elements in selectors
[01:11:16] <Whirl3d_> If so, I've never heard it referred to that way...
[01:11:26] <Whirl3d_> but you had the right idea, regardless.
[01:11:50] <Whirl3d_> put your html in a variable and wrap it in jquery like $(htmlVariable);
[01:11:52] <Nece228> ok, thanks for help
[01:12:08] <Nece228> thats what i just did
[01:12:32] <Whirl3d_> sure. And you can also append text to the variable to make it look nicer in your code if you need.
[01:12:59] <Whirl3d_> var htmlVa="bunchh of code"; (newlin) htmlVa+="nextlineofcode"
[01:13:16] <Whirl3d_> it's just a basic sstring at that point
[01:14:18] <Nece228> so thats the only way to break lines?
[01:14:47] <Whirl3d_> you are talking about in your code editor, right?
[01:15:21] <Nece228> i guess
[01:15:23] <Whirl3d_> just keep in mind it's html text
[01:15:42] <Nece228> i need to scroll horizontally really long
[01:15:51] <Nece228> or if i do word wrap it gets messy
[01:15:55] <Whirl3d_> so if you put a return between two elements like </p>    return <p> then it doesnt' matter
[01:16:11] <Whirl3d_> just like in regular html...
[01:16:52] <Whirl3d_> but you might get screwy results if you broke lines in the middle of paragraphs,....i'm not sure...maybe not.
[01:16:56] <Whirl3d_> ?tias
[01:16:57] <bot-t> Try It And See
[01:17:12] <Nece228> well thanks ill see
[01:23:27] <Hippie_> $('p.temp') faster than $('p').hasClass('temp') ?
[01:23:43] <Whirl3d_> yes
[01:23:52] <Whirl3d_> and they have two different results
[01:23:58] <Whirl3d_> one is boolean, one jquery
[01:24:28] <Whirl3d_> $("p.temp") returns a jquery object whereas $("p").hasClass("temp") returns true/false;
[01:24:48] <Hippie_> ahh okay didn't think of that :p
[01:34:34] <pneftali> hi guys - is jquery plugin copy to clipboard works ?
[01:37:33] <Cork> pneftali: copy to clipboard can be done ok, if its through the user pressing ctrl+c
[01:37:42] <Cork> but you can't really induce it from js
[01:38:55] <pneftali> jquery abandoned the idea eh ?
[01:39:42] <xec> pneftali: jquery is a javascript library, and as such it is obviously limited to what js can do
[01:40:06] <pneftali> :c do u guys use zclip as an alternative ?
[01:41:05] <xec> never heard of zclip before, but it appears to use flash
[01:41:09] <pneftali> for ajax generated content it seems not working properly, i need to click the copy button a couple more times before it actually copy the text
[01:41:13] <pneftali> yeah it uses flash and js
[01:41:13] <xec> so an alternive is flash, yes
[01:41:48] <Xotix> hi
[01:42:52] <xec> alternative*
[01:43:41] <rethus> why this simple script not show my class of the encapsulating yspan> element? http://jsfiddle.net/hkqXr/1/
[01:43:55] <rethus> click on right image
[01:43:57] <Xotix> i'm having a draggable connected to a dropable/sortable. If my element has e.g. a margin 40px: and i drop it, it always moves to the border of the droppable placeholder and ignores its margin. ->  http://screencast.com/t/JYP1oUzws the element moves to the left, ignoring it's margin. why?
[01:45:16] <xec> rethus: there is no encapsulating span
[01:45:45] <rethus> ?
[01:45:52] <rethus> <span class="filter_39">
[01:45:56] <rethus> for example
[01:45:56] <xec> rethus: only the left image has one
[01:46:14] <rethus> aaarrrgghhhh
[01:46:18] <rethus> thanks xec
[01:46:21] <mindis|wurk> Xotix probably has something to do with absolute/relative and the inline css values draggable assigns to the element
[01:46:25] <rethus> time for a coffe
[01:46:44] <xec> ^^
[01:47:08] <Xotix> mindis|wurk:  hm ok thanks
[01:47:10] <Whirl3d_> can you pass data with .proxy?
[01:47:18] <Whirl3d_> or should I just use .apply
[01:47:26] <mindis|wurk> the sheer hackyness of js/css comes to the front with draggable/resizable etc.
[01:47:44] <Whirl3d_> or maybe I shouldjust call the method directly for a change. LOL nvm
[01:52:07] <greek> Hi how do I check if my checkbox is checked? I have it's selector set up and everything
[01:52:15] <greek> Basically I want true / false if possible?
[01:52:33] <Cork> greek:  prop('checked')
[01:53:10] <Cork> and if you want to change it prop('checked', true/false)
[01:53:11] <greek> Cork: would using prop() be the preferred way to check if something is disabled too? For example I'm currently using .attr("disabled", true) on another element
[01:53:20] <Cork> yes
[01:53:29] <greek> Great, thanks Corey
[01:53:32] <greek> Cork even
[01:53:36] <Cork> attr is the wrong function if your using jquery 1.5+
[01:54:01] <Cork> attr checks the attribute while prop works on the property (live)
[01:54:31] <Cork> basically $()[0].checked => $().prop('checked')
[01:55:03] <greek> Cork works nicely thanks
[01:55:11] <Whirl3d_> it's not a problem to assign data to an element's data object by $(elem).data("config.index",num); is it?
[01:55:20] <Cork> nope
[01:55:26] <Cork> it won't be added to the dom element though
[01:55:39] <Cork> but it will be stored
[01:55:58] <Whirl3d_> I have a feeling that a pregnant statement....tel me more...
[01:56:04] <Whirl3d_> ty, btw
[01:56:26] <Cork> pregnent??
[01:56:40] <nFFF> Guys when you have the same image, loaded multiply on the page, the subsequent images carry little to no overhead right?
[01:56:42] <Whirl3d_> like you had something more to say, but were holding off for me to ask....
[01:56:46] <Cork> ah
[01:56:47] <nFFF> Theyre just loaded from cache
[01:56:53] <Whirl3d_> kind of teasing with it...
[01:56:55] <Whirl3d_> lol
[01:56:57] <Cork> .attr adds attributs to the dom element
[01:57:10] <Cork> .data reads it if it doens't have it in its internal cache
[01:57:19] <Cork> but it never sets it on the element
[01:57:38] <Whirl3d_> thank you thank you thank you for the easy to understand explanation.
[01:57:40] <Cork> so .attr('data-something', 1) .data('something') works
[01:57:49] <Whirl3d_> I was struggling with that earlier.
[01:57:55] <nFFF> Cork, I have 3 product images small loaded on the page, when a user clicks it, it loads it full screen into a sort of photo viewer like facebook, but full screen.
[01:57:55] <Cork> but .data('something', 1) .attr('data-something') doesn't
[01:58:13] <mindis|wurk> i've taken a habit of doing every data-related thing through attr just so that they never get mixed up
[01:58:24] <nFFF> For the best response time, Im cloning the images on page load, settign them positon absolute, left 0 top 0 etc, and display to none
[01:58:38] <Whirl3d_> but does that take time?
[01:58:49] <nFFF> and then when a user clicks a small image, Im just doing display:block on corresponding large image
[01:58:58] <nFFF> is this the best way in your opinion?
[01:59:07] <Cork> not really
[01:59:14] <Whirl3d_> in other words, is it more performant at times to not use the .attr method. And it is attr, not prop, right?
[01:59:33] <Cork> if you don't show the image you won't gain anything more then prefetching the source image
[01:59:43] <Cork> decoding happens on draw in modern browsers
[01:59:48] <nFFF> Cork, hows the best? Ive tried various ways
[02:00:11] <nFFF> I had an empty img div in the photo viewer,a nd just changed the src property on click
[02:00:11] <Cork> a simple prefetch script should work fine
[02:00:14] <nFFF> but there was a delay
[02:00:32] <nFFF> ill fiddle
[02:00:35] <nFFF> one moment
[02:01:02] <Cork> for(images) { var prefetch = new Image(); prefetch.src = url; }
[02:01:22] <nFFF> The images are already loaded on the page
[02:01:34] <nFFF> Im talking about fastest response for small -> to large
[02:01:44] <Cork> thats the rendering part
[02:02:03] <Cork> and when browsers show the second image they will render it again
[02:02:12] <Cork> unless they still have an old rendering in memory
[02:02:22] <mindis|wurk> is there a safe way to remove something from a selection set during .each()?
[02:02:24] <Cork> opera is especially restrictive on this
[02:02:27] <nFFF> If it is set to opacity:0;
[02:02:30] <nFFF> is it rendered?
[02:02:35] <nFFF> but hidden?
[02:02:40] <Cork> mindis|wurk: from a selection?
[02:02:48] <Cork> no
[02:02:49] <mindis|wurk> yes, not from dom
[02:03:00] <Cork> mindis|wurk: not sure what you mean
[02:03:02] <vl1234> GA
[02:03:24] <vl1234> ho to append div in table in dynamically
[02:03:30] <vl1234> how to append div in table in dynamically
[02:03:45] <Cork> vl1234: just select the td and append it
[02:03:45] <Whirl3d_> mindis|wurk,, what abaout collection.not(elem)
[02:04:37] <vl1234> ya like that only am did........table = table + "<tr><td><div id="sample">created div</div></td></tr>" ;
[02:04:58] <mindis|wurk> Cork something like var divs = $('div'); and divs.each( function() { } and i want to remove one or more of the divs from var divs selection during the .each()
[02:04:58] <Cork> you mean table is a string?
[02:05:16] <vl1234> ya
[02:05:25] <Cork> mindis|wurk: thats a bad idea, that will offset the loop
[02:05:27] <vl1234> its any thing wrong in that'
[02:05:38] <Cork> mindis|wurk: better store the elements you want to remove and do it when your done
[02:05:38] <mindis|wurk> Cork arr, thought as much
[02:06:02] <mindis|wurk> alright, it was mostly for optimizing purposes in this case
[02:06:22] <Cork> mindis|wurk:  var filter = $([]); divs.each(function() {  ... filter = filter.add(this); }); divs= divs.not(filter);
[02:06:57] <Cork> hmm on second thought
[02:07:16] <Cork> mindis|wurk: var filter = []; divs.each(function() {  ... filter.push(this); }); divs = divs.not(filter);
[02:07:20] <Cork> should work just as well
[02:09:55] <nFFF> Cork, any way to optimize this: http://jsfiddle.net/nAdsy/
[02:10:42] <nFFF> If on page load, I loaded the image into #large-photo, and would the repsonse be noticably faster?
[02:11:40] <Cork> ah, your resizing the image in html
[02:11:48] <Cork> though you used two different images
[02:12:16] <Cork> nFFF: if anything you could delegate the click action instead of binding it on each element
[02:12:24] <Cork> other then that, don't think so
[02:12:50] <Cork> $(this).clone() might be an option
[02:13:08] <Cork> as that would reuse the image data you already have decoded
[02:13:47] <nFFF> Yea tried that
[02:13:52] <nFFF> Im thinking this might be fastest:
[02:13:52] <nFFF> http://jsfiddle.net/nAdsy/1/
[02:14:02] <nFFF> It seems slightly more responsive to my eyes, but could be placebo
[02:14:24] <Whirl3d_> the first one seem a lot faster to me, btw
[02:14:48] <Whirl3d_> just double checked and yeah, probably a full second faster
[02:14:52] <nFFF> So pre-clone the images, to the a hidden photo-viewer, and on click change display:block
[02:15:01] <nFFF> rather then on click clone and display:block
[02:15:32] <nFFF> Thats wierd Whirl3d_
[02:15:38] <Cork> nFFF: thats not the cloning i was talking about
[02:15:50] <nFFF> Youd think, pre-loading the img into the element, and only changing visibility on click
[02:15:56] <Cork> one sec
[02:16:00] <nFFF> Cork, Yea, Ive tried the cloning as well
[02:16:02] <Whirl3d_> I just did it about 4 times in a row and only once was it questionable...the other times, it was really obvious...
[02:16:04] <nFFF> I have like 4 different ways
[02:16:30] <Whirl3d_> jsfiddle couldn't affect it could it?
[02:16:45] <Whirl3d_> how would you time this? qUnit (never used it)
[02:17:55] <Whirl3d_> you could show/hide it a 10 times in a row to determine which was technically fastest, maybe...
[02:17:56] <nFFF> http://jsfiddle.net/nAdsy/2/
[02:18:01] <nFFF> this is the clone way
[02:18:16] <Whirl3d_> much bigger than the page, btw
[02:18:25] <Whirl3d_> and off to the rightI only see the shoulder
[02:18:40] <nFFF> Yea this is jsut afiddle example
[02:18:42] <nFFF> not the real page
[02:18:58] <Cork> nFFF: http://jsfiddle.net/nAdsy/3/
[02:19:31] <Cork> that has the likelihood of reusing the old image data
[02:19:34] <Whirl3d_> I would ease it in. Nobody wants a sudden jarring image to take up their screen
[02:19:40] <nFFF> Yea theres a delay there for me
[02:19:50] <nFFF> <nFFF> http://jsfiddle.net/nAdsy/2/ this actually is most responsive for me
[02:19:56] <nFFF> using .clone()
[02:20:18] <Cork> nFFF: did you try the /3/ ?
[02:20:23] <nFFF> Yep
[02:20:29] <Cork> and it was slower?
[02:20:29] <nFFF> I get a delay on Chrome
[02:20:47] <Cork> intressting
[02:20:51] <Cork> its instant here
[02:21:03] <nFFF> Actually the more I click it, faster it gets
[02:21:23] <nFFF> Did you try /2/
[02:21:24] <Cork> ya, cause if will have the rendered data in memory cache
[02:21:27] <Cork> ya
[02:21:38] <nFFF> That seems fastest for me
[02:21:47] <nFFF> be interesting to see if it could be timed
[02:21:53] <Cork> it does the same thing as 3, except it will add more and more images to the page
[02:22:21] <Cork> you append the image to the viewer, but you never replace/remove it
[02:22:36] <Cork> and my apply the css rules
[02:22:43] <Cork> *mine
[02:26:39] <nFFF> http://jsfiddle.net/nAdsy/5/
[02:26:48] <nFFF> This feels nice, or you think more animation?
[02:40:04] <Whirl3d_> why can't you just leave two copies of the image. One huge and one small. Then the click handler just makes the huge one toggle display
[02:40:25] <bl1nk7> hi all
[02:41:20] <Whirl3d_> nFFF, and that way you could really just toggle the active class and apply css animations for smoother animation
[02:41:51] <bl1nk7> i'm trying to do a multiple replace with a variable name as search string; var search = '[COLOR_1]'; var string = '[COLOR_1] [COLOR_2] [COLOR_1]'; string.replace(search, 'replaced'); only works for the first occurrence of the search string; any ideas? thanks
[02:42:32] <nFFF> Whirl3d_, thats what /1/ does
[02:42:48] <Whirl3d_> result=source.replace(/search/ig, "");?
[02:43:22] <Whirl3d_> nFFF, that changes the src attr
[02:44:00] <Whirl3d_> I mean duplicate the <ul> in the small thing, change the css to display:none, the images to pos:fixed and then toggle display by adding a class
[02:47:21] <bl1nk7> Whirl3d_:  thanks, that works; but somehow [search] does not work
[02:47:48] <Whirl3d_> might need to escape the []
[02:48:06] <Cork> Whirl3d_: you can't use a variable in a regex expression
[02:48:43] <bl1nk7> Cork: any solution for that?
[02:48:50] <bl1nk7> Whirl3d_: how can they be escaped?
[02:50:30] <Cork> ?eval var search = '[COLOR_1]'; var string = '[COLOR_1] [COLOR_2] [COLOR_1]'; string.replace(RegExp(search.replace(/[-\[\]\/\{\}\(\)\*\+\?\.\\\^\$\|]/g, "\\$&"), 'g'), '<replaced>');
[02:50:31] <caniuse> Cork: '<replaced> [COLOR_2] <replaced>'
[02:50:49] <diverdude> what is the difference between .prototype and fn.extend?
[02:51:00] <Whirl3d_> lol no way
[02:51:33] <Cork> ?eval RegExp.escape = function(str) { return str.replace(/[-\[\]\/\{\}\(\)\*\+\?\.\\\^\$\|]/g, "\\$&"), 'g'); };  var search = '[COLOR_1]'; var string = '[COLOR_1] [COLOR_2] [COLOR_1]'; string.replace(RegExp(RefExp.escape(search), '<replaced>');
[02:51:33] <caniuse> Cork: 'SyntaxError: Unexpected token )'
[02:51:58] <Cork> ?eval RegExp.escape = function(str) { return str.replace(/[-\[\]\/\{\}\(\)\*\+\?\.\\\^\$\|]/g, "\\$&"), 'g'); };  var search = '[COLOR_1]'; var string = '[COLOR_1] [COLOR_2] [COLOR_1]'; string.replace(RegExp(RefExp.escape(search)), '<replaced>');
[02:51:58] <caniuse> Cork: 'SyntaxError: Unexpected token )'
[02:52:01] <Cork> grrr
[02:52:06] <Cork> ?eval RegExp.escape = function(str) { return str.replace(/[-\[\]\/\{\}\(\)\*\+\?\.\\\^\$\|]/g, "\\$&"), 'g'); };  var search = '[COLOR_1]'; var string = '[COLOR_1] [COLOR_2] [COLOR_1]'; string.replace(RegExp(RegExp.escape(search)), '<replaced>');

[02:52:37] <Cork> -_-'
[02:52:43] <Cork> so many typos >_<
[02:52:47] <bl1nk7> thanks Cork!
[02:52:53] <Cork> diverdude: none
[02:52:54] <bl1nk7> what's wrong with the first one by the way?
[02:53:07] <diverdude> Cork: why do we have both then?
[02:53:15] <Cork> diverdude: fn is used to be able to compress the variable better
[02:53:31] <diverdude> Cork: compres variable?
[02:53:32] <Cork> diverdude: cause unless you actually use fn as prototype it doesn't exist
[02:53:48] <Cork> prototype is the javascript default
[02:53:51] <Whirl3d_> var search = '[COLOR_1]'; var string = '[COLOR_1] [COLOR_2] [COLOR_1]'; var result=$.map(string.split(" "), function (i, term) {return term==search?term:null});
[02:54:38] <diverdude> Cork: fn is some wrapper ?
[02:54:45] <Cork> diverdude: yes
[02:55:11] <diverdude> Cork: defined by jquery?
[02:55:22] <Cork> diverdude: jQuery.fn = jQuery.prototype = {
[02:55:27] <Cork> right again
[02:55:44] <Cork> ^ thats from the jquery source file btw
[02:55:54] <diverdude> Cork: hmm ok...so one should always use fn if using jquery
[02:56:12] <Cork> and on other objects it normally doesn't exist
[02:57:12] <diverdude> fn is preferrable?
[02:57:16] <diverdude> in most cases
[02:57:26] <Cork> its compresses better
[02:57:41] <Cork> as prototype is a default defined bariable
[02:57:51] <Cork> compressors normally don't compress it
[02:58:11] <diverdude> Cork: what do you actually mean when you say it compresses better?
[02:58:17] <Cork> but ya, thats basically the only difference
[02:58:46] <Cork> diverdude: try minify var my_var = undefined;
[02:59:07] <pneftali> how do you stop a plugin from binding a click event ?
[02:59:14] <Cork> and then try minifying (function(undefined){ var my_var = undefined })(undefined)
[02:59:31] <Cork> pneftali: you can't really
[02:59:39] <diverdude> Cork: hehehe i dont even know how to minify :D
[02:59:43] <Cork> unless you overide the on/bind/live handler
[03:01:04] <Cork> diverdude:
[03:01:06] <Cork> http://jscompress.com/
[03:02:00] <Cork> diverdude: run this through it:
[03:02:00] <Cork> (function(){ var my_var = undefined; })(); (function(undefined){ var my_var = undefined; })(undefined)
[03:03:02] <diverdude> Corey: yes
[03:03:15] <diverdude> Cork: ^
[03:03:15] <Cork> diverdude: additionally it makes the code shorter $.fn.my_func = vs. $.prototype.my_func =
[03:03:24] <Cork> diverdude: check the output
[03:03:35] <Cork> the value before the = in the two functions
[03:03:37] <Webuser153> hi, can someone help with a problem with json. i have a small java server app which will send json if you call the address out, when accessing it with a browser, i get the output, but when trying to access it with ajax, i am unable
[03:04:09] <diverdude> ahh
[03:04:10] <Cork> Webuser153: same domain as the website with the javascript?
[03:04:16] <Webuser153> nope
[03:04:26] <Cork> ?g crossdomain ajax
[03:04:30] <bot-t> Cork, Cross-domain Ajax with Cross-Origin Resource Sharing | NCZOnline - http://www.nczonline.net/blog/2010/05/25/cross-domain-ajax-with-cross-origin-resource-sharing/
[03:04:42] <Cork> hmm, bah bad link
[03:04:51] <Cork> Webuser153: browsers block cross domain ajax calls
[03:05:03] <Webuser153> yeah, that i found out
[03:05:07] <Cork> Webuser153: your stuck with blocking older browsers
[03:05:11] <Cork> or using jsonp instead
[03:05:45] <pneftali> hmmm... how about I have a div created after via ajax. can I apply delegate('#newDiv', load, myfunction) to it ? i tried it but it didn't work.
[03:06:10] <Cork> delegate load?
[03:06:13] <pneftali> with 'load'
[03:06:18] <Cork> ah
[03:06:20] <Cork> no
[03:06:34] <Cork> adding things through js doens't trigger load
[03:06:44] <Cork> only page reload does
[03:07:03] <pneftali> ic made sense, thanks
[03:08:01] <pneftali> Cork: what events i can use that triggers after .append/.html is called ?
[03:08:11] <Cork> there is none
[03:08:15] <Cork> at least not cross browsers
[03:08:31] <Cork> use the callbacks
[03:09:53] <pneftali> but callbacks can't be used here as I have elements created after ajax that triggers future events as well. so need delegate/bind to that
[03:10:37] <Cork> you can build a wrapper function that trigger callback solutions
[03:10:50] <Cork> or trigger custom events for you
[03:12:19] <diverdude> Cork: so if i were to extend the twitter bootstrap modal box so that it would be draggable i would use fn.extend right?
[03:12:48] <Cork> never used bootstrap, so can't say
[03:13:09] <Cork> but it was on validator right?
[03:13:41] <pneftali> Cork: the major problem is this plugin i'm using, zclip, already binds click event to an element. so if i do something like delegate('click'..., $(x).xclip()), i have to click it twice to make it work
[03:14:00] <diverdude> Cork: if bootstrap was on validator?
[03:14:08] <Cork> diverdude: sorry, donno where i got that from >_>
[03:14:13] <Cork> XD
[03:14:56] <diverdude> Cork: what is validator haha :D
[03:15:05] <Cork> diverdude: https://github.com/twitter/bootstrap/blob/857b8fb8be81178d14f59c126c1381b09aff7c0f/js/bootstrap-modal.js
[03:15:20] <Cork> diverdude: forget it i mixed it up with a plugin i helped a guy with this morning
[03:15:28] <arkascha> I got a very strange problem with a small web app I implemented: it uses the jquery ui datepicker and all is fine, except:
[03:15:31] <Cork> donno what my brain went on there
[03:15:35] <arkascha> in one single dialog the datepicker does open and works when clicked, however the associated text input field does not change its date, as if being unrelated...
[03:15:37] <arkascha> In other dialogs the same datepicker works like charm and I cannot find any differences...
[03:15:45] <arkascha> Does that ring a bell for someone ?
[03:15:48] <diverdude> Cork: yeah thats the one
[03:16:04] <Cork> so .fn.modal = function (option) {
[03:16:21] <Cork> $.fn.modal would be the function to overwrite
[03:16:26] <diverdude> Cork: problem is that i cannot decide where it should be placed, nor can i drag it
[03:16:48] <Cork> you mean your extension?
[03:17:31] <diverdude> Cork: in the twitter bootstrap modal
[03:18:04] <Cork> diverdude: put it in its own file extending the default object
[03:20:11] <diverdude> Cork: default object?
[03:20:24] <Whirl3d_> nFFF, what about this: lol. My code is a mess, but the idea is sound: http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/fqXvT/14/
[03:20:28] <Cork> the original object if you prefer
[03:21:15] <diverdude> Corey: ahh ok you mean create a js file where i use fn.extend to extend to original twitter bootstrap modal object?
[03:21:38] <Cork> or simply $.fn.modal
[03:21:48] <Cork> your only overwriting a single function after all
[03:29:05] <johnline> looking for a jquery tabs script that fades in and out the content, but instead of hiding them, offsets them off the page
[03:35:23] <nFFF> Whirl3d_, :) I don't see any difference performance wise, and the code is a mess :D
[03:35:39] <RishiKul> hi, I'm looking for a kind of js which is used by these guys https://www.do.com/
[03:38:38] <Whirl3d_> nFFF, you could clean the code up to about 3 lines
[03:39:16] <Whirl3d_> I was just trying to check if it made any difference not appending or prepending or changing sources...just removing a class
[03:41:22] <Whirl3d_> and, fyi, my code allows you to reuse it with any collection of images you want. By binding the on handler to the parent div, it's not bound to the individual images. So any pair of images would work so long as the bigguns were in the same order as the lillun
[03:42:02] <Whirl3d_> 8)
[03:42:24] <Whirl3d_> but I am not the brightest bulb in the pack. I was just checkin it out LOL
[03:42:59] <johnline> fyi i am not a bulb
[03:43:28] <Whirl3d_> ceci n'est pas une pipe...right?
[03:45:38] <poppiez> any idea why IE7 won't submit a form when clicking the submit button but submits perfectly fine when hitting enter?
[03:45:45] <pneftali> \m/

[03:49:10] <shoky> mornin
[03:49:25] <shoky> poppiez: my guess would be that its bcz its a button and not an input

[04:17:37] <johnline> i now need to modify this so it doesnt fully hide the content, but moves it off the page :\
[04:17:55] <shoky> Webuser153 you just need to output the specified callback name , parentheses, and the json object

[04:32:31] <pachet> function *foo* ( ) { -->.
[04:32:54] <pachet> if its a function expression ( var foo = function ( ) {--> ) then its optional whether to name it or not
[04:33:12] <pachet> i still recommend doing it ( var foo = function foo ( ) { --> ) because it makes debugging easier
[04:33:16] <pachet> Xotix^
[04:34:57] <Whirl3d_> johnline, http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/2b3fH/11/  similar to your color changing bg
[04:35:07] <Xotix> function() is a statement right? At least i've read it somewhere. the example works if i put it into () but why? also, the following () will "execute" that function. -> http://jsfiddle.net/usA2U/2/
[04:35:39] <Cork> Xotix: no its an expression without a reseaver
[04:35:56] <Cork> Xotix: a statement must have a name for the function
[04:36:07] <Cork> or you have to execute the function
[04:36:07] <pachet> Xotix: what Cork said
[04:36:15] <Cork> (function() {})()
[04:36:17] <pachet> placing something within parentheses is usually an implicit expression
[04:36:19] <Cork> !function() {}()
[04:36:24] <Cork> and so on is ok too
[04:36:32] <Xotix> Cork ah yeah of c ourse sry about that.

[04:39:04] <johnline> it seems a little jerky

[04:39:38] <Whirl3d_> johnline, I don't see it move
[04:40:14] <johnline> the movement is not meant to be seen, i just have some js galleries to go in these tabs, that seen to hate being hidden
[04:40:22] <johnline> *seem
[04:40:42] <Whirl3d_> I see.
[04:41:06] <Whirl3d_> maybe fade out the top one and fade in the bottom one using the same formula i used
[04:41:53] <johnline> that does make for a nicer effect
[04:55:18] <Whirl3d_> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/K6LaP/16/

[04:57:53] <shoky> effect
[04:58:38] <Whirl3d_> smooth fade between content panels that can't be hidden, just positioned off stage
[04:59:05] <shoky> why cant be hidden
[04:59:19] <Whirl3d_> messes up the content inside for some reason.
[04:59:27] <Whirl3d_> probably googleMaps or something. LOL
[04:59:52] <shoky> lol. even with just opacity:0 ??
[05:00:07] <Whirl3d_> opacity is fine, its display:none that's a problem
[05:00:22] <shoky> so why not just opacity:0 ;S
[05:00:31] <shoky> i mean, why the need to position off stage
[05:00:33] <Whirl3d_> and opacity:0 with the wrong zIndex messes up click handlers
[05:00:49] <Whirl3d_> Well, it's not my project, first of all. LOL Ask Johnline...
[05:00:49] <shoky> righ
[05:00:53] <shoky> ok ;)
[05:00:56] <Whirl3d_> lol
[05:01:19] <Whirl3d_> I just do something similar with the color bg and thought it would make his smoother (which it does...)

[05:03:40] <Whirl3d_> see. that's what I wanted my pubsub for. It polls the "current" image and either calculates a color match or uses the "preferred" color set in the elments data-config attribute
[05:04:20] <Whirl3d_> and then it it becomes super easy to turn off as well.
[05:04:57] <Nece228> can i use soemthing like
[05:04:59] <Nece228> .find('#productprice', '#newproductprice').val()
[05:05:26] <Aamir> Nece228:  u can use  .find('#productprice, #newproductprice')
[05:05:38] <Aamir> but .val() is to get value of specific input
[05:06:00] <Nece228> so what should i do?
[05:06:04] <Nece228> i need value
[05:06:28] <Aamir> take value for these two one by one?
[05:07:23] <Nece228> .find('#productprice'.val(), #newproductprice'.val())?
[05:07:29] <Aamir> yes
[05:07:37] <Nece228> ah thanks for informing
[05:07:39] <Aamir> oh no
[05:07:59] <pi3r> i guys
[05:08:03] <pi3r> *hi
[05:08:17] <codeAssassin> hi pi3r
[05:08:34] <Aamir> var val1 =  selector.find('#productprice').val();   var val1 =  selector.find('#newproductprice').val();
[05:08:36] <pi3r> codeAssassin: Hello :D
[05:08:43] <Aamir> val2 = *
[05:09:01] <pi3r> i'm wondering, is it possible to get a li "index" in a ul
[05:09:22] <pi3r> link, the li clicked is the third or second etc ...
[05:09:23] <Aamir> index @pi3r
[05:09:53] <Nece228> well it didnt work
[05:10:00] <Nece228> thanks ill try your one

[05:10:55] <Aamir> pi3r:  http://jsfiddle.net/aamir/FNKhB/
[05:11:12] <pi3r> Aamir: ty, trying now
[05:11:53] <codeAssassin> http://jsfiddle.net/nJ8L9/
[05:12:04] <codeAssassin> damn you fast Aamir
[05:12:07] <codeAssassin> lol
[05:12:16] <diverdude> how do i make twitter bootstrap modal always pop up in the center of the screen?
[05:12:25] <pi3r> codeAssassin: indeed he is
[05:12:52] <codeAssassin> at least you get the gist
[05:16:31] <Whirl3d_> I keep running into the same pattern and I can't help but feel like I am missing something: I keep having the "hideContent","showContent" methods applied to various scopes. Should'nt there be an easy way to abstract that enough to be able to use the same Next, Prev, First, Last, Show, Hide methods?
[05:20:34] <hayrikk> hi
[05:20:41] <bjhaid> Hi please can anyone point me to a menu plugin that has support for sub-menus
[05:21:52] <johnline> hmm shoky, thinking about just hiding with opacity
[05:22:10] <johnline> but doesnt opacity:0; keep things 'in the flow'?
[05:22:23] <Whirl3d_> johnline did you see the fiddle I posted last?
[05:22:25] <codeAssassin> diverdude: try something like this http://jsfiddle.net/y4vKS/1/ (needs a little bit of tweaking i suppose)
[05:22:27] <Whirl3d_> It's super smooth
[05:22:47] <johnline> i saw it is smooth
[05:23:02] <johnline> i am trying to understand the part where the fades are crossing eachother
[05:23:39] <Whirl3d_> I put the new content on top of the old content and then as one fades out, it calls the "step" function at each change...
[05:23:39] <codeAssassin> bjhaid: superfish http://users.tpg.com.au/j_birch/plugins/superfish/#getting-started
[05:24:11] <Whirl3d_> then in the step function, it changes the opacity of the one below it...so as one gets to 90% the other is at 10% and so
[05:24:15] <johnline> step is a sort of interlacing?
[05:24:32] <Whirl3d_> step is the timer function for animate
[05:24:39] <Whirl3d_> timer is not the best word
[05:25:16] <Whirl3d_> Every time the jquery modifies the animate properties, the step function is called. That's thousands of times in a normal animation sequence
[05:26:10] <Whirl3d_> by adding a callback function the "step", it allows you to have one element's animation properties affect another's properties dynamically without having to animate them both.
[05:27:07] <Whirl3d_> so I worked with opactiy, but you could just as easily make one slide off into the sunset while animating the color of another...
[05:28:07] <Whirl3d_> or lots of times, you'll want to fadein/fadeout an element while it's contents are doing something else (like sliding in)...
[05:28:27] <bjhaid> codeAssassin: thanks
[05:28:54] <Whirl3d_> rather than running two animations, just run the one and use the step callback to handle the other...I know there are values passed to the step callback, but I forgot to look them up.
[05:28:55] <codeAssassin> bjhaid: np
[05:36:24] <diverdude> codeAssassin: hmmm that seems to have no effect :(
[05:36:48] <codeAssassin> diverdude: i imagine you can't make a fiddle?
[05:37:09] <diverdude> codeAssassin: not really....hmm or maybe i can...moment i will try
[05:37:12] <codeAssassin> diverdude: maybe it overwrites the left and top OR its position isn't set to absolute
[05:41:44] <diverdude> codeAssassin: hmmm i made one here, but its hard to see in the small window http://jsfiddle.net/eK6Pg/23/
[05:42:33] <fRAiLtY-> Can anyone help here, this code doesn't correctly select the column but does select the row: http://dev4.printpartnerships.com/flyer-printing (fiddle of the same code working here: http://jsfiddle.net/exzpb/46/
[05:43:40] <codeAssassin> diverdude: you set it to left: 50% and top: 50%
[05:44:32] <diverdude> codeAssassin: set what?
[05:44:41] <codeAssassin> in bootstrap.css
[05:45:11] <diverdude> codeAssassin: i was hoping to avoid correcting the source
[05:46:59] <codeAssassin> diverdude: http://jsfiddle.net/eK6Pg/25/
[05:47:53] <diverdude> codeAssassin: i see...do you know why the small modal is not visible?
[05:48:45] <codeAssassin> diverdude: the mailmodal?
[05:49:06] <diverdude> codeAssassin:  remMailModal
[05:49:22] <codeAssassin> diverdude: its under there
[05:50:24] <codeAssassin> diverdude: actually no its replaced
[05:50:34] <diverdude> codeAssassin: but i set high z-index to avoid that
[05:51:42] <diverdude> codeAssassin: hmmm replaced? But im setting show on both of them
[05:52:17] <fRAiLtY-> If I have a div with 4 selects in, can I select them child objects via the parent without specifically knowing/using the ID? for example if I have a div called "holder" and a table inside, I can select the table by doing #holder table
[05:52:36] <fRAiLtY-> How can I get the selects, like #holder select[1] or something?
[05:52:49] <codeAssassin> diverdude: moment, need to work out a possible bug
[05:54:32] <diverdude> codeAssassin: ok
[05:55:16] <QueueQueue> @frailty  $('#holder > select')
[05:55:25] <diverdude> codeAssassin: in the fiddle?
[05:55:35] <fRAiLtY-> QueueQueue:  Yes but I have 4 selects, and I only want to "read" the first one
[05:55:49] <fRAiLtY-> like in php if it's an array you'd do object[0] to get the first item etc
[05:56:22] <QueueQueue> you can use .first()
[05:56:37] <QueueQueue> $('#holder').first()
[05:57:51] <QueueQueue> Or to ensure you're getting the select (incase you add other elements within the #holder div  you can use $('.test > select:first')
[05:58:08] <QueueQueue> where .test is #holder of course xD
[06:00:42] <canijaster> saludos
[06:04:34] <codeAssa_> diverdude: nah in a paid project lol
[06:06:05] <diverdude> codeAssa_: ahh hehe :)
[06:06:09] <diverdude> codeAssa_: did you fix it?
[06:06:21] <fRAiLtY-> QueueQueue:  And can you get the second or subsequent select by saying select:second ?
[06:06:28] <codeAssa_> diverdude: doing a presentation now, sorry man
[06:08:18] <diverdude> codeAssa_: :(
[06:10:05] <QueueQueue> @FrAiLtY-   No, use nth-child    $('#holder > select:nth-child(2)')
[06:10:25] <QueueQueue> You can use that for grabbing the first element as well, just less clean looking if you know you're going to always want the first.
[06:10:52] <QueueQueue> However nth-child is nice in that you can dynamically pass a counter for cases where you're doing something a little more complex
[06:11:16] <xec> are there other elements but selects in this #holder?
[06:11:33] <xec> a sample of the html would be useful
[06:13:20] <fRAiLtY-> xec:  http://dev4.printpartnerships.com/flyer-printing There will be a couple of check boxes etc, but atm I'm just after grabbing the selects, except the id's are dynamic and  I want to use something else
[06:13:25] <fRAiLtY-> It's the 4 selects
[06:13:39] <fRAiLtY-> The div isn't called holder either, just an example :D
[06:15:00] <xec> oh, in that case i'd probably use .eq() -- something like $("#product-options-wrapper").find("select").eq(1) -- if you wanted the second select?
[06:19:04] <QueueQueue> @xec Is there an efficiency gain or other advantage i'm not thinking about in using eq over nth-child?
[06:21:09] <xec> QueueQueue: only slight i'd think, but yes. Although; the reason i asked was because "select:nth-child(2)" would match the second child, and only if it is a select
[06:21:43] <xec> if you see what i mean. so if there are other elements as siblings it wouldn't work as intended
[06:22:12] <nicesukhi> how to find multiple div(s) position whoes class name is same?
[06:22:49] <xec> QueueQueue: if you wanted the second select you probably what nth-of-type instead
[06:23:20] <QueueQueue> @xec oh you're right. For some reason I thought select:nth-child(2) would select the 2nd instance of a select element regardless of previous elements... Not the case.
[06:23:51] <QueueQueue> Intuitively based on that syntax, that's what it would imply... But I suppose not. xD
[06:25:05] <xec> but, i'm not sure jquery selectors support nth-of-type, never tried it
[06:27:39] <diverdude> Hello, is there any way i can ensure that modals are always centered? Like here: http://jsfiddle.net/eK6Pg/32/ the small modal is in the top left corner of the big modal. How can i center that?
[06:28:30] <Damiano_> guys what is the function to get the email for the blog ?
[06:30:29] <QueueQueue> Yeah, honestly I don't run into many cases where I need to grab elements in that manner
[06:31:47] <FJ1> i need help with a jQuery Plugin. has somebody time for me?
[06:33:27] <diverdude> any1?
[06:33:56] <Zhy> FJ1 just ask, if there's someone who can help you and is willing to do so he will let you know
[06:34:05] <Zhy> diverdude does the modal you want to centerh ave fixed dimensions?
[06:34:22] <diverdude> Zhy: no
[06:34:27] <FJ1> can somebody say if this https://github.com/isocra/TableDnD/issues/10Â is an jquery or a plugin Problem?
[06:34:28] <socialhapy> â˜… Issue #10 on TableDnD (FlashJunior; 6h, 25m ago): Problem with jQuery 1.8 (pre version)
[06:34:29] <Zhy> Ahhh that's ... unfortunate =D
[06:35:14] <Zhy> i'd give it a fixed width, class with absolute positioning and left: 50%; margin-left: -halfwidth
[06:35:14] <diverdude> Zhy: why
[06:35:25] <Zhy> uhm and do the same for height where I'd calculate the height
[06:36:09] <Zhy> diverdude afaik the most basic way to cenetr something would be when you have the correc dimensions and then apply a class with: position: absolute; left: 50%; margin-left: -halfwidthpx;
[06:37:33] <diverdude> Zhy: ahh ok...what do you mean with fixed dimensions?
[06:37:43] <diverdude> Zhy: that they cannot change?
[06:37:51] <Zhy> width: something; height: something;
[06:37:52] <Zhy> yupp
[06:38:19] <QueueQueue> You could dynamically get those dimensions and calculate the margin pretty easily
[06:38:28] <Zhy> or if the content of the modal is dynamic and can become very large, then I'd at least set the width and calculate the height
[06:38:42] <Zhy> QueueQueue seconded, as I said ^^
[06:39:44] <diverdude> QueueQueue: how would you do that in this fiddle? http://jsfiddle.net/eK6Pg/32/
[06:40:00] <shoky> FJ1: it works fine http://jsfiddle.net/K7wWb/
[06:46:12] <diverdude> QueueQueue: ?
[06:47:04] <nh2> how is .trigger('change') implemented? What native method does it call?
[06:48:11] <danzik17> nh2: you can read the src on github - https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/event.js#L210
[06:49:31] <FJ1> @shoky where can i see that you use the preversion of jquery 1.8?
[06:50:44] <ianmassey> .j #r/cigars
[06:51:02] <nh2> danzik17: yes, but there is a lot of conditional branching going on and it hasn't become clear to me yet which way 'change' goes. As for other events, probably https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/event.js#L346 is called, but elem['change'] doesn't exist in contrast to e.g. elem['focus']
[06:51:18] <shoky> FJ1: http://jsfiddle.net/K7wWb/1/
[06:51:30] <shoky> nh2: it doesn't call any native method..
[06:51:41] <shoky> nh2: it calls the registered event handlers
[06:52:00] <Timo89> diverdude http://jsfiddle.net/qMEAC/9/
[06:52:24] <shoky> er sry nvm.
[06:52:55] <DeltaHeavy> I have an event that will not fire, but an alert that prooves the class exists. It's spitting out 0 errors or warnings and I have no idea what could be causing this. I would make a JSFiddle normally but this HTML is created with JS created HTML with information from an AJAX request. Anybody know what could cause this? http://pastebin.com/4WRA2iJC
[06:53:00] <Timo89> you can of course do the same for width what I did for height
[06:53:12] <Amicasa> poor Nicki minaj :( i hope its not true :( http://www.globalscandal.com/317
[06:53:23] <fuchstronaut> kann ich bind an (click-) event with a name to an object, so if i bind it again, it will be overwritten?
[06:53:35] <shoky> nh2: using a debugger you can see in one minute which branches are used..
[06:54:28] <shoky> debugger; el.trigger('change')
[06:54:50] <fuchstronaut> can I bind an (click-) event with a name to an object, so if i bind it again, it will be overwritten?
[06:54:52] <nh2> shoky: That is true, but debuggers don't give useful hints as you just did
[06:55:18] <ranza> i have a bunch of elements with data-age="28" and so on. I would like to filter those elements against multiple values. So i have an array like [10,11,12,13,14,15]. I do a for loop on the array and then filter the elements against $(this).data('age') === array[i] = true : false
[06:55:59] <ranza> It seems like its only running the filter once for some reason. Have any of you had that experience?
[06:56:18] <FJ1> @shoky strange.. thx for your help.. i need to finde the problem.
[06:59:01] <shoky> nh2: also the comment in the src spells it out:  // Call a native DOM method on the target with the same name name as the event.
[06:59:30] <shoky> (if it exists)
[07:01:12] <ranza> http://jsfiddle.net/C4tLj/ this is what im trying to do. Is there any other way around?
[07:01:49] <shoky> fuchstronaut:  you can't overwrite it, but you can namespace the events for easily unbinding and then rebinding. e.g.  $('#el').on('click.mystuff', ...);   ...    $('#el').off('.mystuff').on('click.mystuff', ...);
[07:02:03] <fuchstronaut> thanks
[07:02:15] <fuchstronaut> thought there might be a way to just have one binding per name
[07:02:44] <shoky> nope it's a list of handlers per event type
[07:04:29] <shoky> ranza: its problematic to use the loop index 'i' inside of a callback
[07:05:54] <shoky> ranza: unless you have a function scope , so use each:  http://jsfiddle.net/C4tLj/3/
[07:05:59] <ranza> shoky: ive tried to change it to something else, and even define it http://jsfiddle.net/C4tLj/2/
[07:06:19] <shoky> mm
[07:06:27] <ranza> shoky: but even yours doesnt work :)
[07:06:35] <ranza> it doesnt filter the elements as it should
[07:06:44] <shoky> yea i didnt fix it yet ;)
[07:06:59] <shoky> uhh
[07:07:03] <shoky> lemme rewrite it ;p
[07:07:09] <ranza> thanks man :)
[07:08:19] <shoky> er
[07:08:27] <shoky> including jquery might be useful :P
[07:09:04] <ranza> shoky: oh, it should be there. At least it is on mine :)
[07:11:26] <NodeX> ok it's definately troll-oclock.
[07:11:28] <NodeX> PHP rocks
[07:11:31] <NodeX> true story
[07:13:00] <shoky> ranza http://jsfiddle.net/C4tLj/6/
[07:13:05] <QueueQueue> I haven't done any php stuff for a couple years now xD
[07:13:13] <QueueQueue> Been all .NET, obj-c and Java.
[07:13:20] <shoky> ranza or http://jsfiddle.net/C4tLj/7/  if you wanted the inverse filter
[07:13:49] <ranza> shoky: oooh clever using indexOf
[07:14:00] <shoky> 'in' would work too
[07:15:12] <octatone> how can I test that an object is a $.promise() or $.deferred() ?
[07:15:24] <shoky> ranza: but don't use 'in'
[07:16:27] <NodeX> PHP is definately the best language of them all
[07:16:35] <shoky> octatone: $.isFunction( obj['promise'] )  ?
[07:17:30] <_trev> octatone, if ( $.isFunction(obj.promise) && $.isFunction(obj.resolve) )
[07:18:02] <_trev> octatone, basic feature detection
[07:18:03] <shoky> that wouldn't work for promises tho
[07:18:24] <octatone> that's not really helpful as that's not telling me if it was constructed by jequery
[07:18:29] <octatone> just that a function named that exists
[07:18:36] <johnline> Whirl3d_ where i have got to
[07:18:37] <johnline> http://jsfiddle.net/K6LaP/20/
[07:20:06] <mzarella> what's the recommended method for letting the user know that information is being retrieved
[07:20:19] <ranza> shoky: awesome sir, it works! Thanks. Great catch on the indexOf
[07:20:20] <mzarella> i wonder how the loading widgets work
[07:20:56] <shoky> octatone: that's the best you'll get.. you can check for some more functions if you want ;)
[07:21:56] <_trev> lol
[07:22:44] <shoky> the code for deferred is really really short and simple.. some private variables are $.Callbacks but thats it
[07:24:02] <ajpiano> octatone: even $.Deferred itself just has to check that the thing that it's been given has a .promise property and that it's a function https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/deferred.js#L97
[07:24:34] <_trev> octatone, I would imply duck typing
[07:24:49] <natas77> hi guys
[07:24:52] <nFFF> Gus offsetY doesn't start at 0
[07:24:53] <_trev> If it has methods of deferred, it is a deferred.
[07:25:00] <nFFF> anyway to get window offset?
[07:25:03] * shoky quacks
[07:25:06] <nFFF> so top of page == 0
[07:25:10] <octatone> It's too bad you can't check it's an instanceof
[07:25:17] <shoky> no it's not
[07:25:18] <natas77> how can i add a table element wie jquery pressing a button?
[07:25:33] <_trev> natas77, window.pageYoffset?
[07:25:44] <natas77> like addNewElement() and it adds e new table
[07:25:51] <natas77> window page
[07:26:05] <natas77> ther is a page allready
[07:26:06] <diverdude> Timo89: hey, i tried your example and it seems to be working for height, but not width for some reason. Do you have any idea if im doing something wrong? http://jsfiddle.net/eK6Pg/47/

[07:36:10] <shoky> peeer: then why are you showing 'body'? you never hid it.
[07:37:09] <johnline> display:block; on the item contained inside the li sunbeam
[07:37:10] <peeer> shoky I did?
[07:37:23] <peeer> $("body > :not(.control)").hide();
[07:37:26] <peeer> doesnt this hide body=?
[07:37:40] <peeer> everything but control element
[07:37:54] <shoky> peeer: you did $('body').show()
[07:38:08] <shoky> peeer: and you had other problems.. anyway,  http://jsfiddle.net/jXBQ8/4/
[07:38:23] <shoky> no it doesn't hide body
[07:38:48] <shoky> $("body > :not(.control)").hide();    hides direct descendants of body that dont have 'control' class
[07:38:57] <nFFF> shoky, window.event.offsetY when my cursor is at the top of the webpage, I get the co-ords: 170
[07:39:00] <nFFF> I need it to be 0
[07:39:04] <nFFF> any ideas why this is happening?
[07:39:31] <peeer> shoky okay, but the only difference between yours and mine is that you added :not(.control) to the 2nd toggle
[07:39:48] <shoky> peeer no that's not the only difference... take a closer look
[07:40:04] <nFFF> Well I know why it's happening, it's due to the browsers top address/toolbar
[07:40:08] <nFFF> But I need to negate this
[07:40:14] <peeer> aah shoky
[07:40:15] <peeer> Isee
[07:41:15] <peeer> but shoky, how do I change the content of #close_all?
[07:41:32] <peeer> you see what am trying to achieve in the code
[07:41:47] <peeer> I can change the content of .control but not without messing with the style
[07:42:42] <sunbeam> how can I have the submenu items of a li (the ul) be the full width of the text? without having to set the width?
[07:42:45] <sunbeam> Can this only be done with js?
[07:43:17] <shoky> nFFF donno what you mean:  http://jsfiddle.net/QVyqK/
[07:43:56] <johnline> sunbeam: display:block; on the item contained inside the li
[07:44:06] <Timo89> diverdude I think it's gotta do with the way you're doing the css stuff (the outcommented lines at the bottom), those are just numbers, but left: needs something like em, px or % in conjunction with the number
[07:44:22] <shoky> peeer: in my last fiddle it doesnt mess with the style..
[07:45:35] <diverdude> Timo89: but why does it work for height and not width then?
[07:46:42] <tdskate> what's the quickest way to do this: `array.push(array.shift());` 5 times ?
[07:46:58] <nFFF> shoky, yea my bad it ws the wya the image was loading
[07:47:34] <EyePulp> tdskate:  for loop?
[07:47:55] <_trev> var i = 0; while ( var obj = array.shift() || i < 5 ) { array.push ( obj ); }
[07:48:01] <tdskate> EyePulp: was hoping for a oneliner
[07:48:25] <EyePulp> no reason you can't one line the for loopâ€¦ =)
[07:48:44] <shoky> _trev you forgot i++
[07:49:15] <shoky> easier to i=5; while (i--) ..
[07:49:36] <Timo89> diverdude I'm a bit confused, working from the original fiddle you provided : http://jsfiddle.net/eK6Pg/47/ do I need to uncomment anything? As far as I can see the bigger modal window is not aligned in the vertical center
[07:49:44] <_trev> Array.prototype.push.apply( arr1, arr2.splice( 0, 4 ) ); ?
[07:50:17] <_trev> err 5
[07:50:19] <_trev> not 4
[07:50:42] <_trev> 1 liner :P
[07:50:55] <diverdude> Timo89: here use this fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/eK6Pg/76/
[07:51:00] <shoky> 6 byte gzipped
[07:51:22] <diverdude> Timo89: as you can see i have tried to add some pixels manually which makes a difference
[07:52:16] <diverdude> Timo89: i still dont understand why 'margin-left': (parseInt(remMailModal.outerWidth()))/2 *(-1) does not center it though
[07:52:27] <sunbeam> johnline: i already use that
[07:52:31] <stevec-1> is it possible to use the css n notification ie 4n for every 4th item
[07:53:00] <doublerc> Can someone help me implement a plugin within an existing .js file? I have my gallery here (grid-gallery.js) : http://pastebin.com/Hi9yAUk5 and I was told I could insert  cloudzoom by inserting this plugin at the top: http://pastebin.com/rXprHvsk and inserting the plugin's "initialization code" at line 396 of http://pastebin.com/Hi9yAUk5
[07:53:40] <peeer> Is it possible to run a function while another one is running? If I want to slide the content while fadeIn is currently in effect, how do I do?
[07:53:50] <Timo89> diverdude but it does and you don't even need the 'px' for it. you have "+30" which messes with the centering, remove that and it's centered
[07:54:25] <diverdude> Timo89: yeah like this:  http://jsfiddle.net/eK6Pg/81/    but that is not centered
[07:54:25] <Timo89> if you want it to be in the center of the bigger modal you'd have to center both or put the smaller one into the bigger one
[07:55:11] <Timo89> It's centered to it's parent - the body
[07:55:14] <Timo89> :)
[07:55:52] <fRAiLtY-> xec:  ?
[07:56:47] <diverdude> Timo89: but if one box is wider than the other, in order for both boxes to be centered according to body they must have different offset...else they are not centered
[07:57:26] <fRAiLtY-> QueueQueue: ?
[07:58:10] <Whirl3d_> I dont' get it. I have a div that has the "hidden" class assigned to it and the hdden class clearly says "display:none" and yet is says user-agent style sheet says if is opacity:1 not hidden..
[07:58:22] <QueueQueue> fRAiLtY-  ?
[07:58:51] <diverdude> Timo89: if box 1 is 5 cm and box 2 is 10 cm and masscenter of the 2 boxes are to be in the exact middle of the page they have to be shifted
[07:59:04] <fRAiLtY-> QueueQueue:  That line with eq() in it that xec typed for me up there when we were chatting, can you find it as my client doesn't hold that much info and I went afk just after then :
[07:59:05] <fRAiLtY-> :x
[07:59:05] <shoky> peeer: animations happen "in the background", asynchronously. you dont need to do anything special to run other code while animation is running
[07:59:24] <fRAiLtY-> When we were talking about selecting the first or second selects in a div
[08:00:18] <shoky> Whirl3d_ some code must've touched the div's css
[08:00:36] <faraway> hi, i know it's not a query question, but does someone here know a site like http://ajaxload.info/  where i can get loading animations as png sprites ?
[08:00:37] <Whirl3d_> hmmm
[08:00:43] <shoky> Whirl3d_ or there is an overriding style
[08:01:03] <QueueQueue> $('#myParent').find('select').eq(0)
[08:01:05] <Whirl3d_> thks. I'll check to see if I did it somwhere in my script...
[08:01:47] <QueueQueue> @fRAiLtY- where 0 is the index of the element you want
[08:03:45] <fRAiLtY-> ty QueueQueue
[08:03:56] <njam> Hi! I'm trying to override the internal "click" event handler - so far I have: $.event.special.click = {delegateType:"click", bindType:"click", handle: function(event) {...}} which works.
[08:03:59] <shoky> doublerc i recently cleaned up that cloudzoom plugin making it easier to use.. want it?
[08:04:30] <njam> Is it possible to call the original handler from within handle()?
[08:05:37] <doublerc> shoky, that would be great
[08:05:49] <diverdude> Timo89: or did i misunderstand something?
[08:05:57] <peeer> shoky yes, I managed with animate now. However, when I reset it with toggle(I use the body). The height is abit confusing, how can I set it to max? Since its body
[08:05:58] <shoky> doublerc: http://antishok.xtreemhost.com/cloudzoom/
[08:06:37] <Timo89> Hang on a sec diverdude, maybe my explanation was  too complicated. I'm making up an easy fiddle to show you what I mean. I'm not familiar with that bootstrap stuff of your fiddle .D
[08:06:39] <Timo89> :D
[08:06:42] <shoky> doublerc: i commented out the part where it automatically checks for elements with the cloud-zoom class and applies the zoom to them. i dont like automatic shit like that
[08:07:59] <nFFF> I have an image, with parent container overflow:hidden, any way to detect how much is overflown?
[08:08:25] <doublerc> how does it apply the zoom?
[08:08:46] <doublerc> shoky - how does it apply the zoom if it doesn't automatically do it
[08:08:50] <Whirl3d_> nFFF, can't youjust take the size of the image and subtract the size of the container?
[08:09:18] <faraway> njam: when i did some event fixing i think i used jQuery.event.fixHooks probably this will work better for you (but i don't know if fixHooks was or is still a valid way)
[08:09:21] <shoky> doublerc:  $('#zoomElement').cloudZoom( options )
[08:09:42] <shoky> doublerc: just like any other jquery plugin
[08:09:57] <shoky> doublerc: just look at the source... see how i use it there
[08:10:05] <doublerc> okay
[08:10:10] <fRAiLtY-> In the table.find rows at the bottom how can I "factor in" the jQuery('#matrix-container').find('select').eq(0) instead of using #attribute127/8
[08:10:12] <fRAiLtY-> http://jsfiddle.net/exzpb/53/
[08:10:27] <shoky> doublerc: if you want it to automatically do it, just uncomment the 3 lines at the end of:  http://antishok.xtreemhost.com/cloudzoom/cloud-zoom.1.0.2.mod.js
[08:10:51] <shoky> doublerc: but it no longer looks at the 'rel' attribute so better do it the way i said before
[08:11:16] <nFFF> Whirl3d_, yea should be more specific, need to know how much of the top fo the image is voerflown
[08:12:05] <doublerc> shoky - can you look at helping me implement cloud-zoom into this .js file: http://pastebin.com/Hi9yAUk5
[08:12:35] <shoky> doublerc: no.. that is too messy and too much.
[08:12:36] <Whirl3d_> take the offset of both and subtract their top values
[08:12:48] <doublerc> shoky - np, thanks
[08:13:14] <shoky> ;]
[08:13:35] <Timo89> diverdude I put a fixed width on the blue div in this one, I don't know why it's set wrong in that case (the console.log says 320 but oh well .. ) anyway: http://jsfiddle.net/qMEAC/31/ both are centered
[08:14:00] <Timo89> (and I know repetitive code, I just wanted to make it quick ^^ )
[08:14:23] <nFFF> Whirl3d_, thanks forgot all about offset()!
[08:15:11] <diverdude> Timo89: yes...those are centered...i agree
[08:15:37] <diverdude> Timo89: there must be something weird with twitter bootstrap modal box
[08:16:00] <Whirl3d_> oooo, the new google hangouts api...
[08:16:53] <njam> faraway: ah thanks! that looks more appropriate!
[08:17:17] <bartmax> is there a jquery function to change a select to it's defaultValue?
[08:17:30] <bartmax> without using form reset
[08:18:25] <diverdude> Timo89: but do you also agree that this is centered: http://jsfiddle.net/qMEAC/31/ and this is not: http://jsfiddle.net/eK6Pg/81/ ?
[08:18:45] <Timo89> Yes of course
[08:18:48] <Eviltwin> bartmax: The only good way I can think of is a form reset
[08:18:59] <bartmax> Eviltwin: input have a defaultValue attr
[08:19:11] <Timo89> If I set the margin as css class it gets centered though:
[08:19:42] <Timo89> http://jsfiddle.net/eK6Pg/93/
[08:19:52] <Timo89> only works if you know the width though
[08:20:01] <Eviltwin> elem.val(elem.attr("defaultValue"))?
[08:20:02] <bartmax> Eviltwin: this worked: $('.child').each(function () { var $this = $(this); $this.val(this.defaultValue); $this.hide(); }); dunno if there's a better approach
[08:21:42] <Timo89> diverdude
[08:21:56] <Timo89> I know what the problem is ;D
[08:22:08] <diverdude> Timo89: aha?
[08:22:11] <Timo89> http://jsfiddle.net/eK6Pg/97/
[08:23:06] <diverdude> Timo89: hmm that looks nice
[08:23:06] <Timo89> maybe you treid to do this 'margin-left': ((parseInt(mailmodal.outerWidth()))/2  for mailmodal too
[08:23:12] <Timo89> but the width was not set
[08:23:24] <diverdude> aahh
[08:23:27] <Timo89> because you set it in the same css() function call where you wuold have done the margin-left
[08:23:42] <diverdude> and then it does not take effect?
[08:23:43] <Timo89> so you either have to set the width beforehand via css class or you call 'margin-left': ((parseInt(mailmodal.outerWidth()))/2  after all that stuff
[08:23:52] <diverdude> ahh okay
[08:24:00] <diverdude> brilliant
[08:24:03] <diverdude> thanks a lot
[08:24:16] <diverdude> that was helpful
[08:26:05] <Timo89> :) you're welcome
[08:26:27] <Timo89> I should have noticed it right away but oh well ... ^^
[08:29:53] <nFFF> Guys, how to make this scroll on mousemove much more smooth: http://jsfiddle.net/nAdsy/38/
[08:29:55] <nFFF> shoky ^^
[08:30:26] <nFFF> Ive seen over site with similair functionality, and the top: position will be -100.209138293801283021 i.e. lots of decimal places
[08:30:31] <nFFF> which makes it much more smoother
[08:30:45] <astropirate> nFFF, make it faster
[08:30:50] <astropirate> it will seem smoother
[08:32:54] <nFFF> thats not the answer
[08:33:06] <nFFF> or the solution to my needs
[08:33:19] <nFFF> it needs to be slower and smoother
[08:35:55] <astropirate> you can ask for your money back <_<
[08:38:10] <rethus> what did this means: div[class~="filterRows"]
[08:38:25] <rethus> it means equals the sting anywhere in the value?
[08:38:54] <Whirl3d_> nFFF, if you use clipping it will help.
[08:39:14] <dust--> hi, using jquery's .animate() to grow the width of a div when hovered, how can i resize the contained canvas dynamically as it grows so the visible growth of the div is continuous?
[08:39:35] <nFFF> Whirl3d_, clipping?
[08:40:36] <rethus> what did this mean ~= ?
[08:40:47] <rethus> div[class~="filterRows"]
[08:40:51] <gellis11> I have two radio buttons in a form, and when one is selected it hides a certain form field and shows another using jQuery slideUp and slideDown functions. The problem is I have validations in the class and while it's hidden on the page the validation is still active so I can't submit the form. Is there any way to totally remove the form fields using jQuery and then bring them back when the
[08:40:51] <gellis11> other radio button is selected?
[08:40:52] <NodeX> tilde equals
[08:40:58] <gellis11> Or to remove the validations from the class and then reinsert them if the field is shown?
[08:42:03] <NodeX> rethus : it's for contains
[08:42:12] <NodeX> http://api.jquery.com/attribute-contains-word-selector/ <---
[08:42:44] <shoky> nFFF what are you doing with the mouse position there..
[08:42:47] <mzarella> is this how you do a sliding information window? https://gist.github.com/2966534
[08:43:49] <shoky> nFFF: :D:D http://jsfiddle.net/nAdsy/39/
[08:44:12] <bartmax> question: i have an addListener to a function, later i want to 'rewirte' the function but the listener doesn't change. is there a way so the listener fires the function as it is when called and not when the listener is added ?
[08:45:53] <shoky> bartmax: what's an addListener to a function
[08:46:25] <johnkpaul> bartmax: you can't do that directly, addListener/jquery's on stores references to the functions
[08:46:51] <johnkpaul> if you really need that behavior, you'll need to pass a handler that just delegates to something else, and that something else, you can change
[08:47:08] <bartmax> how to delegate to something else ?
[08:47:12] <bartmax> ? delegate
[08:47:19] <johnkpaul> $().click(function(){window.whatever.myChangingFunc()});
[08:47:41] <johnkpaul> so if you want to change it, you change what window.whatever.myChangingFunc does
[08:48:03] <johnkpaul> it seems like there should be a better way to accomplish what you're trying to do, but that is the most straightforward way
[08:48:15] <bartmax> johnkpaul: ty. ill try that
[08:49:14] <Whirl3d_> YOu could also have the handler call an anonymous function that does $(target).trigger("something") and rebind something to something different and the source of the event won't know...I think
[08:50:31] <johnkpaul> Whirl3d_: yeah, that works too, you'd have to $(target).off().on('something', handler) to make sure both aren't being called
[08:50:50] <bartmax> mm... that sounds good too.
[08:56:01] <Danwe_WMDE> Is there a way to run a function which will return a function which I will assign to an objects property via its prototype, and within that generated function "this" refers to the object? Important: I want to do this when no instance of the prototype exists yet, so I can't use call/apply because there is no 'this' there yet. Could of course wrap it in another function but I'd rather not.
[08:56:39] <Whirl3d_> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/ZCfEB/1/
[08:57:10] <nFFF> shoky thanks perfect
[08:57:12] <Whirl3d_> bartmax...that shows how you can bind one event to trigger another...then change the triggered method
[08:57:45] <nFFF> shoky, except when you move your mouse u
[08:57:50] <nFFF> mosue up* it keeps going down
[08:59:59] <X-Raimo> hello, does any one use jquery localization ?
[09:00:37] <X-Raimo> i can't load two files (json)
[09:00:54] <X-Raimo> one replaces another
[09:00:55] <mythril> is there a way to ensure that a given event handler is always the last one in the handler list to be fired, even when it is the first handler attached?
[09:02:20] <Danwe_WMDE> argh, too easy, solved
[09:02:26] <Whirl3d_> you ould overwite the $.Callbacks() .add method to reverse the order to to grab the target one off it's list  and always put it at the bottom
[09:02:57] <rethus> ich mÃ¶chte fÃ¼r jeden DIV innerhalb des divs mit der id editFilterGui eine ID als attribut setzen: http://jsfiddle.net/zbUDy/
[09:03:02] <rethus> wie gehe ich dass am besten an?
[09:03:02] <mzarella> is this how you do a sliding information window? https://gist.github.com/2966534 i'm attempting to reimplement what this guy did: http://thisisleon.co.uk/2009/10/14/jquery-ajax-loading-widget/
[09:03:09] <johnkpaul> mythril: It's ugly, but I've used _.defer/setTImeout(func,0) to handle things like that
[09:03:24] <rethus> kann ich Ihm irgendwie sagen, dass er mir jeden div auf erster ebene unter editFilterGUI geben soll?
[09:03:27] <Whirl3d_> or you could wrap the callbacks object in a callbacks object that had one registerd handler...the one in question
[09:03:28] <johnkpaul> ideally, you'd be restructuring your code to remove the expectation of order
[09:04:46] <Whirl3d_> but a custodian method that fires after everybody else sounds good.. Theres a significant different between expectation of order and expectation of after
[09:05:05] <Whirl3d_> otherwise we wouldn't have callbacks in the firstplace
[09:05:30] <johnkpaul> that's true, I see what you mean
[09:05:32] <Whirl3d_> if you expect to go second to last, you're out of line. LOL
[09:05:46] <Whirl3d_> so you could wrap your deferred using when
[09:05:48] <mzarella> the #loading_display element displays "fetching information", it doesn't slide, it just displays the text with surrounding box
[09:05:53] <Whirl3d_> then it fires after the others
[09:05:57] <mzarella> it doesn't hide either, any ideas why?
[09:06:13] <Whirl3d_> mythril, that's the answer
[09:06:17] <Whirl3d_> us .when
[09:09:59] <mythril> Whirl3d_: thanks, that would probably do the trick, but that doesn't work for me, I'm stuck with a limited subset of jQuery that precludes use of deferreds (Has to be compatible with Zepto.js)
[09:10:35] <Whirl3d_> then you will have to write your own
[09:12:07] <Whirl3d_> you should be able to use the source code for jquery.deferreds to write your own version of a deferred object and manage the order by pushing the handelrs to the top of the stack, rathter tthan the bottom for your custom implementation.
[09:12:53] <gellis11> What would you guys recommend is the best simple form validation library?
[09:14:53] <nFFF> shoky ? :P
[09:16:36] <X-Raimo> I did $("[rel*=loc]").localize("main",skip).localize("test",skip); JQuery didn't work at both elements. While here author says it's possible: https://github.com/coderifous/jquery-localize
[09:21:40] <shoky> nFFF?
[09:22:05] <nFFF> shoky, except when you move your mouse up
[09:22:17] <shoky> nFFF what's the desired effect?
[09:22:20] <nFFF> shoky, whenever you move the mouse it keeps moving down
[09:22:25] <nFFF> up*
[09:22:28] <shoky> yes ..
[09:22:34] <nFFF> when you move the mouse donw, the image should go down
[09:22:39] <nFFF> and the opposite when move mouse up
[09:22:42] <shoky> ok
[09:26:01] <shoky> nFFF smth like this? http://jsfiddle.net/nAdsy/40/
[09:26:15] <niftylettuce> any tag plugin you guys recommend? http://xoxco.com/projects/code/tagsinput/ vs. http://webspirited.com/tagit/ vs. http://textextjs.com/ ?
[09:30:53] <X-Raimo> is this selector $("[rel*=loc\[test]"); - correct ?
[09:31:12] <shoky> X-Raimo: does it work
[09:31:25] <X-Raimo> negative
[09:31:29] <shoky> then prolly not..
[09:32:14] <shoky> you're looking for  "loc[test" inside 'rel' attribute?
[09:32:23] <NoiseEee> X-Raimo: $("[rel*='loc\[test]'");
[09:32:24] <X-Raimo> yes
[09:32:55] <shoky> no
[09:33:08] <shoky> $("[rel*='loc\test']")
[09:33:16] <shoky> forgot the [
[09:33:19] <shoky> $("[rel*='loc\[test']")
[09:33:32] <NoiseEee> indeed
[09:33:38] <shoky> i think your original one was fine too though
[09:33:43] <shoky> without the ''
[09:34:39] <shoky> ah no.
[09:34:47] <nFFF> shoky, like this: http://store.zegna.com/item/store/ermenegildozegna/tskay/261E71D9/cod10/41271231GK
[09:34:50] <X-Raimo> shoky: it works
[09:34:53] <X-Raimo> thanx
[09:34:55] <nFFF> click on an image and see how it works with the mouse
[09:35:05] <nFFF> My head is hurting trying to get it perfect for last 40 minutes
[09:35:21] <shoky> nFFF oh..
[09:35:28] <diverdude> are the alert messages in twitter bootstrap supposed to pop up?
[09:41:01] <shoky> nFFF this is a bit more like it.. http://jsfiddle.net/nAdsy/41/
[09:44:50] <shoky> nFFF: http://jsfiddle.net/nAdsy/42/   need to find the best value for originTop tho
[09:45:22] <X-Raimo> I have an error: XMLHttpRequest cannot load http://static.sfw.su/sfw/navbar/navbar-ru.json. Origin http://sfw.su is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Origin.
[09:46:04] <nFFF> nice placeholder images :D
[09:46:19] <shoky> jsfiddle docs link to it ;p
[09:46:24] <X-Raimo> Can it be fixed using jquery?
[09:47:00] <shoky> X-Raimo: it can be 'fixed' using JSONP or CORS
[09:47:45] <shoky> X-Raimo: or loading from the same domain ;p
[09:48:34] <X-Raimo> shoky: this json should be for several domains
[09:49:43] <nFFF> shoky, how to get it so doesn't overmove the image?
[09:52:49] <shoky> nFFF: http://jsfiddle.net/nAdsy/43/
[09:53:27] <X-Raimo> i did <?php header('Access-Control-Allow-Origin: http://sfw.su/'); ?>  Still error
[09:54:40] <nFFF> shoky, thanks a lot solved my problem
[09:55:41] <shoky> nFFF: the way i did it, it depends on where the original click was.. but i suppose it'd be better to make it depend on where the mouse is relative to the window
[09:56:10] <shoky> otherwise you wont get to scroll the whole image
[09:57:31] <gnarf> X-Raimo: can you use JSONP ?
[09:58:44] <X-Raimo> gnarf: not sure
[09:59:03] <X-Raimo> I try to find out what's JSONP
[09:59:14] <gnarf> X-Raimo: JSONP is way easier to use than trying to get cross origin across browsers
[09:59:17] <gnarf> ?g JSONP
[09:59:19] <bot-t1> gnarf, JSONP - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSONP
[09:59:53] <gnarf> ?g jquery ajax jsonp php

[10:00:21] <X-Raimo> thanx. I go to wiki
[10:06:02] <RealityBall> hello lets say I have a class called .numbers and I have a variable  var numbers = $(".numbers) but I want to only select the first element of class numbers can I do that by typing numbers[0]?
[10:06:42] <gnarf> RealityBall: $(".numbers").first() works
[10:06:46] <gnarf> ?first
[10:06:47] <bot-t1> .first(): Reduce the set of matched elements to the first in the set. http://api.jquery.com/first/
[10:06:48] <gnarf> ?eq
[10:06:48] <bot-t1> .eq(index): Reduce the set of matched elements to the one at the specified index. http://api.jquery.com/eq/
[10:06:49] <ravenzz> you can
[10:06:54] <gnarf> .eq( 1 )
[10:06:57] <gnarf> is really nice
[10:07:03] <gnarf> er rather .eq( 0 )
[10:07:10] <ravenzz> gnarf are them faster than :first?
[10:07:17] <gnarf> ravenzz: yes - by miles
[10:07:40] <RealityBall> hmmmm so I can use eq to select any element within that class?
[10:07:41] <gnarf> ravenzz: :first as a selector can't be processed by qSA
[10:07:44] <RealityBall> cool guys thanks
[10:07:46] <gnarf> RealityBall: also
[10:07:57] <gnarf> RealityBall: the jQuery selection result is actually an array
[10:08:02] <gnarf> so [0] is the actual DOMElement
[10:08:04] <gnarf> of the first match
[10:08:15] <gnarf> or rather "array-like"
[10:08:25] <gnarf> it has .length and [0] ... [length-1]
[10:08:43] <gnarf> ?first selector
[10:08:44] <bot-t1> gnarf, :first Selector - http://api.jquery.com/first-selector/
[10:08:52] <RealityBall> yeah but when I do numbers[0].mouseover(function(){ it doesn't work but yeah I know how to do first
[10:08:54] <ravenzz> i see
[10:08:57] <gnarf> "Because :first is a jQuery extension and not part of the CSS specification, queries using :first cannot take advantage of the performance boost provided by the native DOM querySelectorAll() method. To achieve the best performance when using :first to select elements, first select the elements using a pure CSS selector, then use .filter(":first")."
[10:09:08] <gnarf> although .eq(0) is faster than .filter()
[10:09:21] <ravenzz> RealityBall because you get the DOMElement, not a jquery object
[10:09:23] <gnarf> $(selection[0]) is probably the fastest
[10:09:38] <gnarf> but like
[10:09:40] <RealityBall> oh alright
[10:09:44] <gnarf> .eq(0) does the same thing
[10:09:47] <RealityBall> that makes sense thanks ravens
[10:09:48] <gnarf> and looks cleaner
[10:10:04] <RealityBall> thanks again
[10:10:15] * gnarf hugs bot-t1
[10:10:16] * bot-t1 hugs gnarf back
[10:10:40] <gnarf> bbiab
[10:12:27] <ravenzz> gnarf is first() an "alias" of eq(0) then?
[10:13:00] <ravenzz> yep
[10:13:01] <ravenzz> it is
[10:14:17] <jeeky> I typically just use eq() though
[10:14:27] <jeeky> in case you wanted to know haha
[10:33:15] <jeeky> sdfd
[10:33:26] <poppiez> any way to detect a swipe on the windows phone? no touch support :(
[10:38:58] <jcDesigns> hello, i'm using jquery to load into content from an external file, and then using getScript to load in another js file. It is inconsistent though on loading the js file. Is there a better way to do this?
[10:41:02] <jcDesigns> no takers?
[10:42:16] <knapper_tech> when a select element contains only one option, how to detect "change"
[10:43:51] <jcDesigns> anybody help me with that?
[10:44:13] <NoiseEee> knapper_tech: what could it possibly change *to* ?
[10:44:52] <jcDesigns> nothing maybe?
[10:45:05] <NoiseEee> jcDesigns: "it is incosistent" means what?
[10:45:14] <jcDesigns> sometimes it doesn't load
[10:45:16] <NoiseEee> jcDesigns: post sample code somewhere and maybe someone will chime in
[10:45:18] <jcDesigns> 50/50
[10:45:28] <NoiseEee> jcDesigns: yeah, well chance isn't really a part of computer programming
[10:45:29] <NoiseEee> :P
[10:45:54] <Theowning> NoiseEee says everything I'm going to say before I do
[10:45:59] <Theowning> it's odd
[10:46:03] <xsamurai> using form validate is it possible to turn validation on and off on click event, i rather not loop through all the fields and delete each one at a time
[10:50:08] <jcDesigns> http://jsfiddle.net/Cwwbp/
[10:51:32] <NoiseEee> jcDesigns: if you want to ensure "js/videos.js" is loaded after "centers.js", use callback
[10:52:02] <jcDesigns> alright, but more worried about centers.js
[10:52:09] <NoiseEee> what about it jcDesigns
[10:52:11] <jcDesigns> i will do that though
[10:52:15] <NoiseEee> its always going to load.
[10:52:23] <NoiseEee> look at firebug etc

[11:23:27] <RohanBhangui> lol
[11:23:36] <RohanBhangui> good to see that this channel is diplomatic
[11:23:41] <_trev> Ha :P
[11:25:01] <RohanBhangui> what is ember app anyways?
[11:25:14] <RohanBhangui> or are you gonna tell me to get out as well
[11:25:51] <NoiseEee> RohanBhangui: http://emberjs.com/
[11:27:43] <_trev> Ember is a js MVC framework
[11:27:51] <_trev> The library is ~8k in size!
[11:30:22] <RohanBhangui> wow
[11:30:35] <RohanBhangui> thx for answering and not kicking me out
[11:30:37] <RohanBhangui> lol
[11:30:38] <RohanBhangui> :P
[11:31:25] <gnarf> one of the jQuery Foundation board members is a contributor to ember
[11:31:35] <gnarf> its a pretty cool thing
[11:34:52] <xemdetia> Is the optional [duration] attribute in jQuery UI's addClass() part of the jquery ui you get from google? I've been trying to duplicate the example on the site but it just doesn't seem to do anything at all.
[11:35:23] <gnarf> xemdetia: it is in jQuery UI Effects Core
[11:35:52] <gnarf> xemdetia: which you can use on its own, but should be included in the jQuery UI bundle served by google
[11:36:09] <gnarf> xemdetia: see ?demo
[11:36:13] <gnarf> damn
[11:36:15] <gnarf> no bot
[11:37:02] <xemdetia> gnarf: I am basically cutting and pasting the demo presented on the site and changing it to point to the google CDN'd ones
[11:37:35] <xemdetia> It applies the class successfully, but there is just no transition.
[11:37:48] <gnarf> xemdetia: what version of UI?
[11:37:54] <gnarf> 1.8.18 has a bug
[11:37:58] <gnarf> fixed in 1.8.19
[11:38:02] <xemdetia> 1.8.3
[11:38:09] <gnarf> its prolly there
[11:38:18] <gnarf> try adding another class to it first
[11:38:25] <gnarf> like if there are no classes, its buggy
[11:38:53] <xemdetia> Oh I'm sorry. It does look like it's 1.8.18 on the google site.
[11:40:08] <gnarf> xemdetia: http://jsfiddle.net/TBNDR/
[11:40:38] <gnarf> try with http://code.jquery.com/ui/1.8.21/jquery-ui.min.js xemdetia
[11:41:09] <xemdetia> gnarf: Alright I'll give it a shot. Thanks.
[11:41:11] <gnarf> xemdetia: same fiddle - only with fixed bug: http://jsfiddle.net/TBNDR/1/
[11:41:27] <gnarf> xemdetia: google CDN takes forever to update our releases
[11:41:50] <gnarf> we are already on .21 and google still only has .18
[11:42:09] <mzarella> join #r.javascript
[11:42:12] <NoiseEee> also f google cdn
[11:42:39] <xemdetia> thanks again gnarf
[11:42:51] <gnarf> xemdetia: no prob, i can't believe that bug snuck in ;)
[11:42:57] <gnarf> its totally my fault too
[11:43:04] <xemdetia> Uh oh, the worst sort of bugs
[11:49:28] <Seanmcn> Hi guys, if I want to store a value in a div does it have to be in the div content area for jQuery to "get" it or could i possibly add it into a div tag?

[11:50:37] <gnarf> see http://api.jquery.com/data

[12:26:30] <megalomix> hello guys i have $('#mydiv').append('HTML CODE').fadeIn(999)
[12:26:33] <megalomix> but it does not work
[12:26:44] <megalomix> i mean that i see the html directly withouyt the fadein effect
[12:27:13] <Brodingo> is #mydiv set to display none or opacity 0? or visibility invisible?
[12:27:38] <Brodingo> hidden rather
[12:27:43] <jedimind> $('#mydic').fadeOut('fast', function() { $(this).append('HTML CODE').fadeIn(999) });
[12:27:44] <jedimind> try that
[12:27:48] <jedimind> mydiv of course
[12:27:49] <jedimind> not dic
[12:28:13] <megalomix> Brodingo, no
[12:28:20] <megalomix> it does not exists
[12:28:25] <megalomix> i append it a new code
[12:28:30] <megalomix> it is not hidden
[12:28:38] <megalomix> i create it using append()
[12:28:53] <Brodingo> well use your css to hide it initially
[12:29:11] <megalomix> ok
[12:29:12] <NoiseEee> megalomix: understand your code fades in #mydiv, not your new content
[12:29:39] <megalomix> i need to fade the code i pass in the appen function
[12:29:43] <megalomix> *append()
[12:29:52] <NoiseEee> megalomix: what jedimind said
[12:30:35] <megalomix> i can't but the div has a FORM inside
[12:30:38] <megalomix> i can fadeout it
[12:30:57] <megalomix> i think i have to create it and set it (css) display:none
[12:31:20] <megalomix> and then fadein
[12:31:21] <megalomix> no?
[12:31:28] <megalomix> like Brodingo said
[12:32:10] <Brodingo> well your stylesheet can already have a rule for it
[12:32:55] <megalomix> Brodingo, i used display:none;
[12:33:00] <megalomix> now i try to fadein
[12:34:24] <megalomix> Brodingo, it seems does not work
[12:34:37] <Brodingo> post your code friend
[12:34:47] <nFFF> anyway on jsfiddle to show result in own seperate window?
[12:34:49] <Brodingo> use jsfiddle.net
[12:35:08] <Brodingo> nFFF add /show to the url
[12:35:23] <nFFF> danke
[12:45:52] <LekeFly> How can i click ratio buttons that are hidden with jquery? this one eg: <input type="radio" checked="checked" id="sarp_period_type_id-1" value="-1" name="aw_sarp_subscription_type" class="radio">
[12:47:25] <Kogsworth> I've never tried, but you could maybe change the checked attribute?
[12:47:40] <tippenein> any recommendations for a simple but slick color picker?
[12:47:47] <tippenein> google overwhelms
[12:48:27] <Kogsworth> tippenein: first google search http://www.eyecon.ro/colorpicker/ looks cool^_^
[12:49:15] <Brodingo> yeah i believe they use that on css3please
[12:49:24] <tippenein> I saw that one
[12:50:38] <Kogsworth> what was wrong with it?
[12:52:13] <fedya> if anyone is familiar with the validator plugin, i need some help http://pastebin.com/TivHemCz i can't figure out how to get the method used for validation to return true on success
[12:53:39] <fedya> i was stuck on this yesterday and couldn't get it to return anything because of the callback, here is the TDverify class: http://pastebin.com/XcmK39iH
[12:54:26] <tippenein> It'll work for now, but I only need it to have the left part of that widget and update the square that it spawns from with the new color
[12:55:04] <ezio> how do i stop my ajax loader from loading every time it displays
[12:55:25] <nFFF> shoky alert me when hurrr
[12:56:34] <Brodingo> ezio either a smoke bomb or just stab it really
[12:56:56] <Kogsworth> Ezio style, hehe
[12:57:03] <ezio> i'll make one of the new assassins do it
[12:57:29] <ezio> i'll just use one of my assassin signals
[12:57:43] <fedya> any ideas on another way to have this function return true or false?
[12:59:48] <Jannertje> hi guys! is it possible to load a page via ajax, so that it shows the output whenever it's ready? As opposed to sending it when the script is done running
[13:00:33] <Jannertje> whoopsy -- any answer yet perhaps?
[13:00:33] <ezio> Jannertje, you want to perform a long operation
[13:00:37] <Jannertje> true
[13:00:41] <LekeFly> How can i click ratio buttons that are hidden with other ratio buttons.. this one eg: <input type="radio" checked="checked" id="sarp_period_type_id-1" value="-1" name="aw_sarp_subscription_type" class="radio">
[13:00:42] <ezio> what i do
[13:00:51] <ezio> Jannertje, i pass it off to another thread
[13:00:58] <ezio> and return true that it started
[13:01:01] <ezio> and poll the server
[13:01:04] <ezio> ever 1s
[13:01:14] <ezio> and look for a finished: true
[13:01:27] <LekeFly> Or a button for that matter
[13:01:43] <Jannertje> hmm.. i think somebody isn't understanding the other one
[13:01:46] <Jannertje> let me rephrase
[13:02:01] <Jannertje> i want to make a faux `live log' of a php script which might take hours to finish
[13:02:28] <Jannertje> so the user can track exactly how far the script is
[13:02:39] <NoiseEee> Jannertje: you'd have to use something like socket.io and node.js
[13:02:49] <Jannertje> ;o
[13:03:07] <NoiseEee> Jannertje: php tells socket.io server "i am at step 1",  socket.io tells that to the websocket/listener on the document
[13:03:13] <ezio> Jannertje, have the script update a db or a file with the current locaiton in the script
[13:03:14] <Jannertje> i was under the impression this was more or less standard procedure
[13:03:23] <Jannertje> ah.. database might work yeah
[13:03:24] <ezio> use ajax to get it ever 1 s
[13:03:25] <NoiseEee> Jannertje: no, you get an xhr response when things are done/finito
[13:03:37] <Jannertje> right
[13:03:45] <NoiseEee> either way its really up to your PHP script to break it up into bits, because PHP does things all or none.
[13:03:46] <ezio> Jannertje, you don't need a db, just create a file,
[13:03:56] <ezio> unless you have a db setup already
[13:04:07] <Dr-Bombay> mostly none
[13:04:09] <Jannertje> but i can't really tail the file can i? :D
[13:04:23] <Jannertje> ah well
[13:04:25] <NoiseEee> Jannertje: only through polling/subsequent xhr calls
[13:04:26] <ezio> Jannertje, no need to, just overwrite
[13:04:30] <nFFF> NoiseEee any idea why this doesnt move the image smoothly?
[13:04:30] <nFFF> http://jsfiddle.net/nAdsy/46/
[13:04:54] <Jannertje> @ ezio, good call. this gives me true logging, something i've been wanting anyway
[13:05:28] <ezio> glad to help
[13:08:44] <cmw72> I need to return various pieces of data from a single AJAX request.  Those data elements will then be deposited into existing form elements.  Should I be using JSON  for this?  Or is there a better way to encapsulate my data, and subsequently retrieve the individual data elements?
[13:08:54] <LekeFly> How can i click ratio buttons that are hidden with other buttons.. this one eg: <input type="radio" checked="checked" id="sarp_period_type_id-1" value="-1" name="aw_sarp_subscription_type" class="radio"> like i want that checked clicking on a a element eg..
[13:12:12] <cmw72> LekeFly: $('#my_checkbox').attr( 'checked', true ); should work
[13:12:54] <silverwind> You should use .prop on recent version of jQuery.
[13:16:13] <LekeFly> cmw72: Thanks i will look into that : )

[13:29:26] <shoky> christo_m are you referring to body anywhere..
[13:33:45] <christo_m> shoky: no i dont believe so
[13:39:55] <christo_m> shoky: i just grepped for body in the scripts, no instances
[13:47:49] <shoky> it doesn't tell you where the error is coming from?

[13:59:00] <mzarella> any hints?
[14:00:11] <NoiseEee> mzarella: is '#b_button' a button or input/submit in a form?
[14:04:33] <cohitre> mzarella: you want to prevent the default behavior of the click
[14:04:51] <cohitre> mzarella: http://api.jquery.com/event.preventDefault/
[14:05:56] <rethus> i use dialog, to show an "email-adress input field", which is placed inside of my form-elment.
[14:06:26] <rethus> if i do form submit(), the mailadresses are not sen... only if i don't declare the dif as dialoge
[14:06:47] <rethus> how can i get a modal.window, and add the formular which is inside to the form on the page?
[14:26:06] <rethus> i have a span after a checkbox. how can activate the checkbox, if i onclick on the span?
[14:26:47] <cohitre> rethus: make the span a label and set the for attribute to be the id of the checkbox
[14:26:59] <shoky> rethus: you add a click handler with .click() and you change the checkbox state with .prop('checked', true) (or false)
[14:27:17] <shoky> er yea or make it a label ;D

[14:28:51] <rethus> this is my code.
[14:29:34] <rethus> you mean instead of span class="list_mail", i should use <label class="list_mail for vid[]"> ?
[14:30:42] <cohitre> give your checkbox an id="my-cool-checkbox" and then use <label for="my-cool-checkbox">

[14:50:31] <shoky> RohanBhangui did you try?
[14:50:32] <RohanBhangui> ami suppose to put header class for all 3 or 4 "upper levels"

[14:53:36] <Andrey_V> Hi! Is there a way to partly stop event propagation on the element (i.e. one mouseup will propagate, but not another)? For example: stopping propagation for mouseup event only of certain namespace (just for example, I`m aware of that namespaces does not affect event propagation)...
[14:54:48] <Jon47> you can handle events on the 'mouseup:namespace' event
[14:57:06] <Andrey_V> When I`m binding one mouseup on the element 'A', and stop it propagation, and then I`m binding mouseup for child 'B' - is there a way to make a child 'B' mouseup event to propagate through parent 'A'?
[14:57:20] <mixandgo> hi, is there a way to perform a click on a link and have it follow thru ?
[14:57:27] <Seanmcn> Hi guys, I'm using $.post() to partially update a page.. This works, but then it seems to stop all jQuery working. I think this is due to me using document.ready and the page not actually reloading.. Any ideas?
[14:58:09] <RohanBhangui> shoky
[14:58:14] <RohanBhangui> nvm
[15:01:48] <Andrey_V> It sounds stupid though... If element stops propagation through it, how can any event of stopped type pass ? Definetly there is no way to do it...
[15:02:46] <vacho> how can I get next weeks date range? I want to get this coming Mondays and coming Sundays date?
[15:03:50] <garann> Seanmcn: what kinds of things stop working?
[15:06:18] <LekeFly> Any obvious errors with this code: http://jsfiddle.net/qWbrk/ works on jsfiddle but not at my project..
[15:06:40] <Es0teric> when i click a submit button, i have input fields go red if they are empty... but when i fill them in, and i click the submit button again, they still act empty
[15:08:24] <lionrouge> hi
[15:08:55] <lionrouge> tell me please what's wrong with this: alert( $(this).parent().parent().find(".prodname").text() );
[15:09:05] <lionrouge> shows an empty alert
[15:09:16] <shoky> so?
[15:09:30] <lionrouge> double ,parent() is dirty but it's just for testing
[15:09:40] <shoky> you are doing many things in that one line
[15:09:42] <shoky> break it down
[15:09:44] <lionrouge> i know
[15:09:48] <shoky> figure out which part is not working
[15:10:32] <lionrouge> could you tell me how .parent and .children work with <tr> and <td>?
[15:10:36] <RohanBhangui> what is the differnece between
[15:10:38] <RohanBhangui> $("ul#categories li").hide();
[15:10:40] <RohanBhangui> and
[15:10:42] <RohanBhangui> $("ul#categories>li").hide();
[15:10:44] <lionrouge> are they considered as DOM levels?
[15:11:12] <RohanBhangui> sry for droping a bunch iof code
[15:11:52] <Es0teric> why does this -> http://pastie.org/4128878 work when the fields are empty when clicked once.. but when the fields are filled out, it still passes "invalid" as true?
[15:11:58] <garann> RohanBhangui: the second is looking for a direct child
[15:12:10] <RohanBhangui> okay
[15:12:34] <RohanBhangui> where as the former is looking for all children regardless of direct or indirect
[15:12:41] <garann> yep
[15:12:53] <garann> *all li children
[15:14:23] <Es0teric> can someone help me out real quick?
[15:14:24] <Es0teric> o.O
[15:14:42] <garann> Es0teric: looks like you never reset invalid to false w/in the submit handler
[15:15:13] <mzarella> noisee left
[15:15:14] <jscheel> hey guys, qq - can I have multiple resolves on one deferred? So, only resolve after two async ops have finished?
[15:15:20] <Es0teric> garann you mean after the if(invalid === true) ?
[15:15:24] <mzarella> #b_button is an input/submit button, yes
[15:15:28] <LekeFly> How can i troubleshoot my jquery? console doesnt give me any warnings etc
[15:15:36] <jscheel> or is that just two separate deferreds that should be chained?
[15:15:42] <mzarella> cohitre: that's what i put in recently, but it didn't affect the behaviror
[15:15:45] <mzarella> behavior
[15:15:56] <teewuane> LekeFly: put alert('a'); on different lines in your script. see how far it gets
[15:15:56] <shoky> Es0teric: you never set invalid back to false...
[15:16:03] <ajpiano> jscheel:  $.when( $.ajax(), $.ajax() )
[15:16:32] <ajpiano> jscheel:  $.when( $.ajax(), $.ajax() ).then( fn )
[15:16:39] <jscheel> ajpiano: I'm actually calling a separate function that returns a new deferred promise
[15:16:41] <teewuane> LekeFly: if you are including jquery on your page, and you are getting an error, the error is most likely in your code
[15:16:46] <shoky> pipe time!
[15:17:00] <LekeFly> teewuane: im getting no error tho as far as i can see :p
[15:17:15] <jscheel> ajpiano: just didn't know if I absolutely had to do two separate promises
[15:17:15] <teewuane> what browser are you using?
[15:17:19] <jscheel> ajpiano: thanks!
[15:17:21] <teewuane> LekeFly: ^
[15:17:29] <Es0teric> shoky where would i set it back to false though? because on line 13, that if statement, i did a else setting invalid to false but it still submits the form
[15:17:34] <LekeFly> teewuane: Safari/firefox/chrome
[15:17:59] <shoky> Es0teric: set it to false at the beginning of your click handler..
[15:18:26] <teewuane> LekeFly: from chrome... View > Developer > Javascript Console
[15:18:41] <teewuane> LekeFly: then refresh your page
[15:19:11] <Es0teric> shoky i did that, but when i fill out the fields, it doesnt submit
[15:19:50] <LekeFly> teewuane: i know.. but nothing
[15:19:58] <shoky> Es0teric does it ever submit?
[15:20:28] <shoky> anyway Es0teric all i see in that code is a click handler. i dont see any form submission
[15:20:29] <teewuane> what exactly is not working? what is your experience level with javascript? :)
[15:20:56] <Es0teric> shoky, its form submission but its 'click' not 'submit'
[15:21:08] <LekeFly> teewuane: i could pm the link but i dont want it logged here.. and im a noob:) got it working on jsfiddle but on my site 0 errors..
[15:21:10] <shoky> Es0teric: 'click' is not submit, obviously
[15:21:20] <Es0teric> shoky, obviously not
[15:21:33] <shoky> which is why i say i see no form submission.
[15:21:49] <lionrouge> i want to have a popup window with some html (including form elements). What is the best way to organize it? iframe?
[15:22:47] <shoky> Es0teric: if you're still having trouble, jsfiddle your issue
[15:23:16] <shoky> lionrouge: why not a div?
[15:23:41] <teewuane> LekeFly: the link to your site or the link to jsfiddle?
[15:23:42] <LekeFly> teewuane: heres the jsfiddle at least http://jsfiddle.net/qWbrk/
[15:23:46] <lionrouge> shoky, you mean an invisible div which toggles when i press a button?
[15:23:57] <shoky> lionrouge: pretty much, yeah
[15:23:58] <LekeFly> teewuane: What i would pm would be the link to my site yeah
[15:24:03] <LekeFly> If you have a min :)
[15:24:17] <lionrouge> shoky, thanks i think it's the best way
[15:24:25] <shoky> ;]
[15:24:50] <shoky> lionrouge if you want to load the divs content with ajax check out .load()
[15:25:20] <lionrouge> it's pretty static ))
[15:25:37] <shoky> static div it is then
[15:25:39] <lionrouge> just one varying caption
[15:27:19] <LekeFly> jQuery is loading fine..
[15:27:28] <LekeFly> Strange:/
[15:31:26] <teewuane> LekeFly: that's fine, just pm it. also, you are using the .prop() method, i think i'd normally use .attr() but yeah, send it
[15:44:48] <JuanDaugherty> there's no separate channel for ui?
[15:45:09] <coldhead> not anymore
[15:45:17] <coldhead> your UI problems are #jQuery's problems
[15:45:28] <Hopsy|2> coldhead!!

[15:47:18] <JuanDaugherty> I'm looking for a package which when a page is accessed brings up a modal dialog (.e.g for a login) with the page disabled/grayed in the background
[15:48:15] <JuanDaugherty> of course can build from parts, but hoping to find something close already as it's a pretty common use case
[15:50:15] <Es0teric> i still dont understand how this -> http://pastie.org/4129004 sets invalid as true even after the form is submitted with text in the input fields
[15:52:01] <shoky> Es0teric: did you read what :empty does
[15:52:42] <Es0teric> shoky, it selects all elements that have children?
[15:52:48] <Es0teric> including text
[15:53:02] <shoky> that dont have children, yes
[15:53:13] <JuanDaugherty> there's no contributed widget/effect repo?
[15:53:19] <Es0teric> but shoky, even if i do $(req[i]).val().length === 0
[15:53:23] <Es0teric> it still does the sae
[15:53:27] <Es0teric> *same
[15:53:32] <Es0teric> as .is(':empty')
[15:53:45] <shoky> Es0teric as i've told you before, jsfiddle your issue
[15:54:27] <Zesta> I have a problem with a Jquery slider captions
[15:54:35] <Zesta> the captions work on one site
[15:54:39] <Zesta> and do not on the other
[15:54:43] <Zesta> same code
[15:54:56] <Zesta> work here: http://ise-test.aidemdigital.org.uk/
[15:54:57] <Jon47> Es0teric: it actually does the same thing, or it just produces the same results in your example?
[15:55:08] <Zesta> dont work here:  http://www.i-se.co.uk/
[15:55:11] <shoky> Zesta: why not mention the plugin name that you're having the issue with..
[15:55:20] <Es0teric> Jon47 well produces the same results
[15:55:26] <Zesta> nivoSlider
[15:55:34] <shoky> goodie
[15:56:03] <Zesta> shoky .. any help will be highly appreciated :)
[15:57:00] <Jon47> Es0teric: those two pieces of code might evaluate the same for a given example but they do not do the same thing, figure out what they both do and use the right one for your use case
[15:57:32] <Es0teric> Jon47, i am just going to use what i have on jsfiddle then we'll see
[15:57:59] <JuanDaugherty> hmm, there doesn't appear to be a "gray"/"disable" effect
[15:58:04] <Jon47> one of them determines if the matched element has no children (including text nodes) and the other determines if the .value property is exactly 0 characters long, i hope you can understand the differences there..
[15:58:51] <JuanDaugherty> i guess you have to construct a color animation

[16:09:06] <yi_> I need access to both the button and the jquery ui widget
[16:21:24] <shoky> Es0teric: you have input.msg_box instead of textarea.msg_box

[16:21:38] <Es0teric> whoops... lol
[16:21:45] <Zesta> ?
[16:22:05] <Es0teric> thats not really a required field though, shoky
[16:22:27] <shoky> then you shouldn't put it in the required fields array.. ?
[16:22:52] <Es0teric> shoky, i'll fix that later... thats not really my main problem
[16:23:20] <shoky> oK
[16:23:57] <Es0teric> shoky, but from what you see there, what is making it return true no matter how many times i submit and text is in the input fields?
[16:24:11] <Es0teric> making invalid return true *
[16:24:14] <shoky> its not returning true if the required fields aren't empty..
[16:24:22] <shoky> i mean, false
[16:24:43] <shoky> donno what yer asking
[16:24:52] <shoky> seems to work fine
[16:28:57] <Es0teric> shoky, it doesnt submit the form even after i put text in the input fields
[16:29:49] <shoky> it does for me

[17:20:40] <RohanBhangui> how do i hide all items except on that i click
[17:21:41] <tw2113> children only?
[17:21:58] <tw2113> like clike stuff1 stuff2 stuff3 or stuff4 and all the kids of just that one are shown?
[17:22:20] <saintvinasse> hello, I have the weirdest bug ever with jquery UI
[17:22:22] <mzarella> again, i can't figure out why when you click this button the page is refreshed: https://gist.github.com/2969453
[17:22:47] <saintvinasse> spent half the day on it, wouldn't mind an external look if anyone have 10 min for me
[17:23:13] <mzarella> i asked and went away for a little while looking for some documentation and i found the event.preventDefault() call but it hasn't prevented the webpage from refreshing
[17:23:40] <tw2113> pass in the event part
[17:23:49] <tw2113> $("#b_button").click(function(event) {
[17:23:57] <saintvinasse> http://pjdd.org/sur-les-campus/universites/?var_mode=recalcul on this page, when I activate the #tabs call the page is loaded twice as you can see
[17:26:05] <mzarella> tw2113: yeah, i did that
[17:26:11] <mzarella> i forgot to type that in, sorry
[17:26:18] <mzarella> but it didn't help unfortunately
[17:26:24] <RohanBhangui> @tw2113: say only stuff1 stuff2 stuff3 and stuff4 are open
[17:26:36] <RohanBhangui> and i clcik stuff 1
[17:26:49] <RohanBhangui> how can i toggle all the rest of the stuffs
[17:26:54] <RohanBhangui> toggle off
[17:27:15] <RohanBhangui> and keep stuff 1 active and make visible stuff1.1 stuff1.2 stuff 1.3 and stuff 1.4
[17:27:34] <tw2113> i'd probably try and get show()/hide() attached to a click hanlder
[17:27:37] <tw2113> handler*
[17:28:06] <tw2113> or toggle a css class that hides them
[17:30:51] <RohanBhangui> and if i had a .animate instead of the toggle
[17:31:20] <tw2113> maybe this can help RohanBhangui https://gist.github.com/2969498
[17:31:37] <tw2113> speaking of mzarella
[17:31:43] <tw2113> maybe try passing in "e" and not "event"
[17:32:00] <tw2113> i'm not sure if "e" is specifically done that way or if it's any variable
[17:38:19] <shoky> TtTttttTtt
[17:47:04] <Whirl3d_> If I create a deferred object and apply a done handler to it like: $defr.done(function(data) { doSomething(data))      then as long as I state defr.resolve(somedata)   the somedata will get passed to my handler correct?
[17:47:24] <shoky> yap
[17:47:33] <Whirl3d_> tyvm
[17:47:44] <shoky> yw yw
[17:49:51] <danheberden> Whirl3d_: even if you attach done after resolution
[17:49:59] <danheberden> IT DOES ALL MAGIC
[17:50:41] <Whirl3d_> so how do I determine when it's important to have defined a function before implementing. it. In other words, I find myself in a circle where I need to call the "configureObject" method has a handler for the initOjbect method, but if there's a problem in side my configuration, I want to re-run the initObject method...which creates a circular reference...
[17:51:35] <shoky> i find myself in a circle trying to understand your q :P
[17:51:42] <danheberden> haha ditt
[17:51:44] <danheberden> *ditto
[17:52:37] <Whirl3d_> Simple:   initObject.() { do stuff.then(configureObject)}    function configureObject() {do stuff; err? then initObject()}
[17:54:33] <shoky> function initObject() { doStuff().then( configureObject ) };   function configureObject() { doOtherStuff(); if (error) initObject(); }
[17:54:37] <Whirl3d_> I am trying to say that I don't understand when the browser is going to required that a named function be defined before I use the reference to it. Sometimes it doesn't mind because it reads all the functions first then resolves the resferences (or at least it seams that way) But sometimes, it wants to compain
[17:54:41] <shoky> (just rewrote what you wrote)
[17:55:29] <Whirl3d_> yeah. I was just spitting it out, your's is beautiful (as always). When will that work and when will it fail?
[17:55:30] <shoky> if you're calling initObject() a second time , i imagine doStuff() is returning a NEW promise
[17:56:04] <Whirl3d_> sorry. then is not the method then....grr. let me do a fiddle real quick
[17:56:12] <Whirl3d_> thanks for the help, btw
[17:56:13] <shoky> oh
[18:06:13] <Whirl3d_> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/Vz5CE/2/
[18:07:20] <Whirl3d_> so you can see there are two functions. initObject and configureBall...each reference the other. This time it works fine. But sometimes it doesn't and I don't know how to accurately predict when it wont work though I kind of understand why...
[18:08:52] <shoky> umm first of all your comment there //but configureBall hasn't been defined yet...
[18:09:00] <shoky> is not true , in 2 senses
[18:09:25] <Whirl3d_> ...listening...
[18:10:40] <shoky> one is that function definitions are "hoisted" to the "top" of the current context, so that references to them are valid even if they appear above them
[18:11:16] <Whirl3d_> Cool. That's how I lassumed it always works.
[18:11:18] <shoky> so that if i write,
[18:11:37] <shoky> var a = fn;  function fn() { console.log('fn!') }   a();
[18:11:47] <shoky> it'll run the fn function and you'll get no complaints
[18:12:12] <shoky> 2nd, that line where you wrote the comment is inside a function,
[18:12:18] <shoky> so it is only evaluated when that function is called
[18:12:35] <shoky> by which time, the configureObject function is "already defined" anyway regardless of hoisting
[18:12:59] <shoky> so even if you wrote   bla()  inside configureObject , you'd only get an error when you actually call the function
[18:13:07] <shoky> not when loading the page
[18:13:21] <Whirl3d_> both make total sense.  Now what is going on when I get that error that "there is no"configureObject" method   or "configureObject " is undefined?
[18:14:21] <shoky> hmm when do you actually get that error?
[18:15:31] <Whirl3d_> Well, it'll com up here in a minute when I post my gallery project usually. So lemme get a working example and i'll post back..
[18:15:47] <shoky> aight
[18:16:23] <Whirl3d_> I figure if nothing else this is like reverse voodoo...you know how you take your car in the shop and it works fine...maybe my code will work fine now...LOL
[18:16:37] <shoky> lol :D
[18:18:22] <chad_c> does anyone know of a good tutorial for basic navigation?  I'm trying to add history support (history.js) and most of the questions I see on stackoverflow ask that www.myhomepage.com/link1 links work.  And mine don't.  So ::head scratch::
[18:18:41] <chad_c> www.homepage.com/#link1 works just fine
[18:19:02] <chad_c> am I missing some sort of listener function to detect /link navigation vs /#link ?
[18:25:25] <Whirl3d_> one more quick question about deferreds. If I have a function that could possibly resolve a deferred in two places at two different times is it a problem if the resolve method gets called a second time? Or do I have to check if the thing is resolved before rsolving it every time?
[18:26:18] <shoky> Whirl3d_ the 2nd resolve is ignored
[18:26:31] <Whirl3d_> perfect.
[18:28:12] <shoky> deferreds are ;D
[18:39:57] <chad_c> or maybe I should use url rewrite?
[18:41:30] <coldhead> i think you want to do that in the client, rather than the server, chad_c
[18:41:38] <coldhead> the server won't see the #bit
[18:41:58] <chad_c> I don't know why I can't figure out this most basic navigation coldhead
[18:42:14] <chad_c> coldhead: I'm just trying to support direct linking to the anchor tag
[18:42:44] <chad_c> www.mydomain.com/#content1 should actually do the same thing as clicking on the menu link that loads the #content1 html file into my div
[18:43:33] <bigredradio> How can I add a new Option to a select that has NO options? http://jsfiddle.net/P4Cbw/
[18:44:11] <Whirl3d_> wil      deferred.then( (doSomeFunction(someValue),(doSomeFunction(otherValue))   work or do I have to write out:   deferred.then (function () {doSomething....     ?
[18:44:12] <bigredradio> From the code, "options" is always undefined.
[18:44:21] <DinoDvornik> is there a channel for Twitter's Bootstrap?
[18:44:34] <coldhead> i don't really understand your struggle, chad_c
[18:44:48] <coldhead> there are a bunch of libs to support that kind of navigation
[18:45:02] <chad_c> coldhead: it IS a struggle, that's for sure.  Perhaps this helps: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11149126/jquery-site-navigation
[18:45:10] <coldhead> http://www.using-jquery.com/2011/01/ajax-navigation-window-location-hash/
[18:45:28] <Whirl3d_> I meant does wrapping parantheses around a named function call with params  roughly equal wrappling an anonymous function declaration around the named function?
[18:45:50] <Whirl3d_> hehe words are cool
[18:48:29] <bigredradio> Actually, this is what I have tried. http://jsfiddle.net/P4Cbw/1/
[18:49:19] <shoky> Whirl3d_
[18:49:29] <shoky> deferred.then( (doSomeFunction(someValue),(doSomeFunction(otherValue))
[18:49:56] <shoky> dono what you're doing there with the parens
[18:50:08] <shoky> you're also missing one ;P
[18:50:23] <shoky> 2
[18:51:02] <RohanBhangui> gonna hit the hay in 5
[18:51:04] <RohanBhangui> quick question
[18:51:06] <shoky> Whirl3d_ wrapping parens around smth doesn't do anything to that smth
[18:51:06] <RohanBhangui> http://jsfiddle.net/rohanbhangui/Lf9SF/9/
[18:51:31] <RohanBhangui> is there anyway by whihc i can take the a.click function and generalize it so that all i hav eto do
[18:51:41] <RohanBhangui> is function(somehting)
[18:51:52] <RohanBhangui> where something is any target i put
[18:52:01] <shoky> what?
[18:52:12] <RohanBhangui> okay let me explain from beginning
[18:52:14] <chad_c> coldhead: basically when I navigate to www.mydomain.com/#navlink1 directly in my browser, it doesn't work unless I also REFRESH.  Not sure why that is.  That's using window.location.hash.
[18:52:23] <RohanBhangui> http://jsfiddle.net/rohanbhangui/Lf9SF/9/
[18:52:33] <coldhead> can we see the code, chad_c?
[18:52:34] <RohanBhangui> i need to make it so that the a.click
[18:52:46] <RohanBhangui> the function that is using a.clcik as the target
[18:52:49] <RohanBhangui> can be continuously
[18:52:51] <RohanBhangui> used
[18:52:56] <shoky> dude
[18:52:59] <RohanBhangui> is there a way of writing that as a seperate function
[18:53:05] <shoky> open notepad or whatever
[18:53:06] <RohanBhangui> something i can continue to use thorugh out the code
[18:53:11] <coldhead> chad_c: you might want some kind of hashchange watcher like http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-bbq-plugin/
[18:53:16] <RohanBhangui> what shoky?
[18:53:21] <shoky> write some complete sentences, with punctuation, that make sense
[18:53:28] <RohanBhangui> okay
[18:53:31] <RohanBhangui> hold
[18:53:32] <shoky> k
[18:54:14] <shoky> "the function that is using a.click as the target" ... ?!?1
[18:55:44] <RohanBhangui> http://jsfiddle.net/rohanbhangui/Lf9SF/9/
[18:55:46] <RohanBhangui> item a.click is using a function that is activated when clicked
[18:55:47] <RohanBhangui> that is what i call a specific function in this case
[18:55:49] <RohanBhangui> how can i generalize that function
[18:55:51] <RohanBhangui> such that i can go something like this (sudo code):
[18:55:52] <RohanBhangui> function(something)
[18:55:54] <RohanBhangui> where function is the .clcik function (which executes other code)
[18:55:55] <RohanBhangui> and something is the target (eg. a.click)
[18:56:15] <RohanBhangui> making sense
[18:56:59] <RohanBhangui> quick question shoky what time (israel time) are you gonna be up until for tom?
[18:57:08] <RohanBhangui> cause i might ask for the solutio nthen
[18:57:12] <RohanBhangui> i gotta go to sleep
[18:57:15] <RohanBhangui> really tired
[18:57:30] <RohanBhangui> or you can email me the answer and the jsfiddle,link to my email
[18:57:34] <RohanBhangui> ill pm that to you

[19:01:10] <RohanBhangui> thx

[19:01:17] <RohanBhangui> cya
[19:01:19] <shoky> np
[19:02:33] <chad_c> coldhead: so how do most sites do navigation without a db backend?  This site is not complex enough to justify a db.
[19:03:13] <chad_c> coldhead: I just don't want to reload an entire page and reset JS just to load a content pane.
[19:05:44] <coldhead> chad_c: the "best" way is to do a router with something like BBQ
[19:05:52] <coldhead> so it will watch the #hash
[19:05:59] <coldhead> and take  some action when it changes
[19:06:06] <chad_c> coldhead: gotcha.  I guess I'll start down that path
[19:06:20] <coldhead> so then all your HTML needs is like <a href="#something">lol</a>
[19:06:20] <chad_c> coldhead: thanks for your advice!
[19:06:29] <coldhead> and that changes the hash to #something
[19:06:42] <coldhead> and your router will do whatever it's supposed to do when that hash is present
[19:06:44] <chad_c> coldhead: yeah I got that already, so I would *think* it would be easy to implement a watcher
[19:07:02] <coldhead> chad_c: best to use something like BBQ if you care about old browsers
[19:07:12] <coldhead> better yet: don't care about them :P
[19:07:13] <chad_c> coldhead: old browsers just won't die
[19:07:19] <coldhead> good luck chad_c!
[19:07:26] <chad_c> thanks coldhead
[19:08:56] <coldhead> bye, RohanBhangui
[19:09:02] <coldhead> i will never forget you
[19:12:58] <shoky> die browsers die!
[19:13:06] <Ukto> is it possible to specify multiple classes on a .submit?  $('.classOne').submit(function(zeeepo) {  where the same code will trigger for class item of classOne OR clasTwo ?
[19:13:27] <shoky> Ukto it's possible to specify multiple selectors in one selector, with commas
[19:13:32] <shoky> $('.classOne, .classTwo')
[19:13:40] <Ukto> aha, thanks :)
[19:14:25] * shoky wonders if zeeepo means 'event' in some language
[19:15:56] <Ukto> hehe was random name used to pass to zeeepo.preventDefault();
[19:18:08] <shoky> lawl
[19:18:11] <mzarella> .done(function(data){alert(data)})
[19:18:23] <mzarella> .done(function(data){alert(data.title)})
[19:18:27] <mzarella> the second one doesn't work
[19:18:44] <shoky> mzarella then your data doesn't have a title property
[19:19:15] <shoky> also "doesn't work" is the worst thing you can say in a support channel
[19:19:35] <shoky> also stop using alerts
[19:20:19] <mzarella> shoky: it does though
[19:20:30] <mzarella> {"title":"a title"} is returned
[19:20:44] <shoky> how do you know? because alert says so?
[19:20:53] <mzarella> because console.log
[19:20:55] <shoky> maybe its just a string containing that text
[19:21:03] <jonkersjoe> hi can someone please help me with jquery tabs ? I tried to use it and it didn't work. So I re-did the example that's on jqueryui.com and that doesn't work either. http://jsfiddle.net/vuyHu/ here's an example where I've copied the source verbatim (I'm guessing) and its not working either
[19:21:09] <mzarella> console.log(data) is running, not alert, just figured it's the same functionality
[19:21:17] <mzarella> and was quicker to type
[19:21:23] <shoky> no, dont use alerts
[19:21:27] <shoky> for anything
[19:22:26] <shoky> jonkersjoe: jsfiddle doesnt automatically include the jqueryui css. http://jsfiddle.net/vuyHu/1/
[19:23:06] <jonkersjoe> shoky: ahh right the css was missing.
[19:24:05] <mzarella> {"title":"some text", "description":"some more text"}
[19:24:36] <jonkersjoe> shoky: thanks
[19:26:36] <shoky> ?js  function done(data) { console.log(data.title) };  done( {"title":"some text", "description":"some more text"} );
[19:26:39] <shoky> ?eval  function done(data) { console.log(data.title) };  done( {"title":"some text", "description":"some more text"} );
[19:26:39] <caniuse> shoky: null
[19:26:50] <shoky> ?eval  function done(data) { return data.title };  done( {"title":"some text", "description":"some more text"} );
[19:26:50] <caniuse> shoky: 'some text'
[19:27:04] <shoky> @ mzarella
[19:28:34] <mzarella> here's my code: https://gist.github.com/2969855
[19:29:01] <mzarella> firefox is just putting "undefined" in the #b_title text field
[19:31:32] <mzarella> why would data.title be a problem if the returned object is as i mentioned
[19:31:37] <mzarella> {"title":"some text", "description":"some more text"}
[19:31:59] <mzarella> it works fine in chrome
[19:32:43] <mzarella> line 16 and 17 were put in specifically for firefox because those at least put "undefined" in the form text fields
[19:33:01] <mzarella> with the jquery calls, the text fields are just left blank
[19:35:45] <bartmax> mzarella: try console.log data
[19:35:51] <bartmax> mzarella: try console.log (data)
[19:36:13] <shoky> he's doing that
[19:37:27] <shoky> mzarella the code looks fine to me
[19:38:06] <shoky> what does firefox tell you when you console.log(data) ?
[19:38:23] <shoky> also why didnt you mention that its only a firefox issue before :\
[19:53:38] <Whirl3d_> I wish there was a setting to turn of the jquery feature that retuns an empty set if the selector fails. So often I find that if jQuery would return undefined, things would be so much easier. I'd even venture to guess that there are more cases where receiving and undefineed error is more benefitial than being able to chain my methods.
[19:53:39] <Whirl3d_> Especially if you consider how many chaned methods are you gonna want to execute on an empty set?
[19:54:30] <coldhead> chained*
[19:57:58] <shoky> Whirl3d_ but i like doing $(...).find('bla').css(...)  or $(...).parent('.container').whatever()  :(
[19:58:12] <Whirl3d_> Sure, on an empty set?
[19:58:27] <shoky> yes, sure, the beauty is i dont have to care if its empty or not
[20:00:02] <Whirl3d_> I am not saying that chaining should go away, just that my experience is such that if the chain breaks because of an empty set. it's broken (and I don't know about it)
[20:00:21] <Whirl3d_> whereas if the chain breaks because an undefined is returned, I know about it
[20:00:38] <shoky> yep both have valid usecases
[20:00:54] <Whirl3d_> That's why a setting to turn it on/off would be nice
[20:01:04] <Whirl3d_> I once wrote a $$ method that did what I wanted
[20:01:13] <Whirl3d_> but I was never sure how to implement it fully
[20:01:31] <saintvinasse> does anyone knows why jquery ui loads me the page twice instead of juste loading a #tabs ?
[20:01:48] <saintvinasse> http://pjdd.org/sur-les-campus/universites/?var_mode=calcul
[20:01:54] <Whirl3d_> I mean it worked for selection criteria, but I didn't know if other methods used $() internallly or how to make them use $$ if they did?
[20:02:45] <shoky> yea i guess that'd get tricky
[20:03:28] <shoky> im beat. g'night
[20:03:43] <Whirl3d_> Sleep well. I'll see ya in the morning.
[20:03:56] <Whirl3d_> thanks as always for your help and advice
[20:04:47] <Whirl3d_> saintvinasse, you might want to scale your bg image rather than tile it.
[20:04:59] <Whirl3d_> I didn't get the double loading thing either
[20:05:20] <saintvinasse> you'll get it. I just did an error
[20:05:43] <Whirl3d_> unless you are referring the the FUOC...Flash of Unformatted Content issue.
[20:05:55] <saintvinasse> Whirl3d_: thanks for the tips with the bg image
[20:06:05] <Whirl3d_> I see what you mean now...
[20:06:17] <Whirl3d_> I thought they were two different menus LOL
[20:06:23] <saintvinasse> member:Whirl3d_: :P
[20:07:35] <Whirl3d_> it looks like you have 2 js errors and 3 CSS errors.
[20:08:35] <saintvinasse> yes I think i actually found one thing that could mess everything
[20:09:11] <saintvinasse> my CMS is injecting an URL in the LI href="" where I put the #tabs-1
[20:10:11] <Whirl3d_> you are adding an href attribute toyour list items? I didn't know that was legit.
[20:13:06] <saintvinasse> http://jqueryui.com/demos/tabs/
[20:13:10] <saintvinasse> that's how they do it
[20:13:21] <saintvinasse> but ok, I have the problem nailed now
[20:13:40] <Whirl3d_> they add the href to the anchor elements
[20:13:46] <Whirl3d_> not the li elements.
[20:14:04] <Whirl3d_> but if you have it solved and it works, right on.
[20:14:08] <saintvinasse> Well. I'm not adding anything to the li element
[20:14:15] <saintvinasse> sorry bout that
[20:14:19] <saintvinasse> mislead you
[20:14:23] <saintvinasse> in my previous message
[20:14:30] <Whirl3d_> np
[21:00:18] <draginx> Is there a way to get tr rows > 0 and < tr rows.length ?
[21:00:41] <bigredradio> I found a weird behavior between jQuery 1.5.2 and later. Check this out: http://jsfiddle.net/KwHBa/4/
[21:00:49] <bigredradio> Anyone explain what is happening?
[21:01:08] <bigredradio> Works (like I expect) in 1.5.2, but newer does not.
[21:01:48] <Eviltwin> What's "expected"
[21:02:13] <bigredradio> in 1.5.2, the attr('options') is defined.
[21:02:23] <Eviltwin> Do you know what an attribute is?
[21:02:29] <Eviltwin> In HTML?
[21:03:04] <bigredradio> Eviltwin: Guess I don't. Pls enlighten me
[21:03:12] <tw2113> the options attribute would be the id="a"
[21:03:28] <Eviltwin> <input type="text" value="Empty">
[21:03:34] <Eviltwin> That tag has the attributes type and value
[21:03:40] <Eviltwin> Set to "text" and "Empty" respectively
[21:03:48] <tw2113> <option> = tag
[21:03:53] <Eviltwin> That's what attributes are
[21:03:56] <bigredradio> Eviltwin: K. I know that much.
[21:04:08] <Eviltwin> .attr was originally designed to get attributes
[21:04:13] <draginx> actually an index of > 0 but < tr.length-1 ?
[21:04:19] <Eviltwin> But along the way they made it do a lot of other crap
[21:04:35] <Eviltwin> So more recently, they cleaned up jQuery
[21:04:45] <Eviltwin> Made .attr actually read/write attributes
[21:05:01] <Eviltwin> <select>s don't have an option attribute
[21:05:12] <Eviltwin> They have <option> tags as children
[21:05:14] <cohitre> draginx: http://api.jquery.com/slice/
[21:05:21] <draginx> i literally just saw that
[21:05:22] <draginx> thanks :)
[21:05:25] <bigredradio> Eviltwin: Makes sense. I can't remember where I came across this way of getting "options"
[21:05:32] <Eviltwin> Well it's not a good approach
[21:05:50] <Eviltwin> Do this instead: http://jsfiddle.net/KwHBa/5/
[21:05:58] <bigredradio> Eviltwin: Agreed.
[21:10:06] <bigredradio> Eviltwin: Thanks'
[21:16:22] <ndimatteo> this might be a dumb question, I'm using infinite scroll to add new elements to a page, these elements have links that are going to be hooked with fancybox, when I apply fancybox to the new elements with a callback function, it reinitializes the elements that were already there, which causes stuff to break. How do I initialize a function to only apply to the new elements added to the page?
[21:18:23] <yaazkal> Hello, I'm having ours trying to solve this: I have a some divs with ajax content. I'm making an .on("click") to make some things when there is a click inside some of the elements loaded. It works with one element but not with other. If I change click for "mousemove" it works on the element that click was not... is too complex? need to see the code?
[21:24:53] <Eviltwin> ?cik @ yaazkal
[21:24:54] <bot-t> yaazkal, Code is King. We don't always understand your explanation of the problem but we all speak code here. Try to make a live (working) demo of your problem at jsfiddle.net
[21:38:42] <ruby_on_tails> why cant i set backgroundPosition using jquery with pixel values ? it works fine for % values
[21:38:47] <yaazkal> Eviltwin, ok... Don't know if I'm clear in the description (check the site) and in the demo. http://alasdemariposa.com/test/e/
[21:39:40] <ruby_on_tails> aah sorry, it has to be negative for px values
[21:39:41] <raj> Eviltwin, regarding that script that you had modified yesterday, how can I ensure the user isn't cheating the time?
[21:40:01] <raj> i can $.post when the card is revealed
[21:40:58] <raj> but the user can change the id of the card or something
[21:41:05] <raj> or post whatever they want
[21:41:07] <raj> no?
[21:41:11] <raj> how can I secure this
[21:41:51] <Eviltwin> The only way to truly secure it
[21:42:07] <Eviltwin> Is to do a $.get or $.post that actually gets the questions for them
[21:42:20] <Eviltwin> And then they $.post back
[21:42:25] <Eviltwin> When they're done
[21:42:33] <Eviltwin> And you track the difference in time server-side
[21:42:36] <raj> so it would have to be a single card being viewed at a single time?
[21:42:57] <raj> like when the click to reveal, they are really posting?
[21:43:07] <Eviltwin> I meant for the set of questions
[21:43:11] <raj> and I return and render the card
[21:43:16] <Eviltwin> I don't think there's a good way to have per-card timing
[21:43:24] <raj> set of questions?
[21:43:43] <Eviltwin> You had a series of questions, right?
[21:45:50] <jquerynoob> I'm looking for help in my jquery code
[21:45:53] <jquerynoob> I'm terribly new at it
[21:46:15] <raj> series of cards
[21:46:16] <tw2113> i figured you were an expert by your irc nick
[21:46:18] <raj> Eviltwin, ^^
[21:46:37] <jquerynoob> I was justifying my nick
[21:46:39] <Eviltwin> jquerynoob: Did you see ?learn
[21:46:42] <bot-t> jquerynoob, First learn JavaScript (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/learn/javascript) then learn jQuery (http://jqfundamentals.com/)
[21:46:49] <jquerynoob> ?learn
[21:46:50] <bot-t> First learn JavaScript (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/learn/javascript) then learn jQuery (http://jqfundamentals.com/)
[21:47:06] <jquerynoob> I guess this is a javascript question
[21:47:13] <jquerynoob> I'm trying to make a bouncing balls system
[21:47:21] <iateadonut> that's what everyone wants
[21:47:25] <jquerynoob> say I have a function in my Ball class
[21:47:28] <raj> Eviltwin, so you're saying to $.post anytime a card is turned over?
[21:47:39] <raj> and then display the card
[21:47:44] <jquerynoob> can I do something like Ball.prototype.collision(ball1,ball2)
[21:47:47] <raj> i'm just afraid of lag
[21:47:59] <Eviltwin> raj: Basically they need to not be able to see the question before the timer starts
[21:48:00] <jquerynoob> then I can store the co-ordinates of ball1, and ball2, and apply my appropriate hit-test
[21:48:24] <Eviltwin> Which you'll need to do server side
[21:48:33] <Eviltwin> They can make any manipulations they want client side
[21:49:04] <jquerynoob> ?
[21:49:13] <raj> Eviltwin, what do you think the lag will be like?
[21:49:15] <raj> noticeable?
[21:49:25] <Eviltwin> Depends on their network connection and the speed of your server
[21:49:47] <jquerynoob> ?
[21:49:47] <Eviltwin> For an example of it working quickly
[21:50:02] <Eviltwin> Basically any time a dialog opens on Facebook
[21:50:09] <Eviltwin> That was caused by a response from AJAX
[21:50:20] <Eviltwin> click -> server -> dialog
[21:50:44] * coldhead takes notes
[21:51:42] <jquerynoob> I thought this place was newbie friendly :(
[21:52:00] <Eviltwin> jquerynoob: You need to learn to be patient
[21:52:17] <coldhead> its very newb friendly, jquerynoob
[21:52:26] <Eviltwin> I was continuing answering a question raj had from before you got here
[21:52:27] <coldhead> this is my first day and everyone's been excellent so far
[21:52:30] <jquerynoob> Alright
[21:52:36] <coldhead> but your question is more #javascript than #jQuery
[21:52:58] <jquerynoob> Well, i'll just wait on what you guys have to say before I get there
[21:53:04] <jquerynoob> Take your time EvilTwin
[21:53:35] <raj> so Eviltwin, you're saying it's not so bad
[21:53:43] <coldhead> have you tried googling for bouncing ball javascript?
[21:53:48] <coldhead> there are a lot of tutes
[21:53:52] <raj> so originally, when I render the page, just render with the card's db pk?
[21:54:49] <jquerynoob> @coldhead, I already have, I already have code where my balls are bouncing, I need to implement collision detection now.
[21:55:02] <o]> hehehe
[21:55:13] <o]> search for collisiond detection algorithms on google
[21:55:19] <o]> there are plenty of them
[21:55:23] <jquerynoob> @coldhead, I already figured the bit for the algorithm too
[21:55:43] <Eviltwin> jquerynoob: So what part don't you hav?
[21:55:45] <coldhead> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/345838/ball-to-ball-collision-detection-and-handling
[21:55:45] <Eviltwin> have*
[21:55:47] <raj> Eviltwin, or else, how will I know which card to render?
[21:55:50] <jquerynoob> I'm just going to use the 2r<less than distance between centers
[21:55:55] <jquerynoob> return true
[21:56:06] <jquerynoob> how do I pass two balls to a function?
[21:56:26] <jquerynoob> Ball.prototype.collision(ball1,ball2)
[21:56:37] <jquerynoob> this doesn't seem right
[21:57:29] <coldhead> ball1.collision(ball2) ?
[21:58:06] <tw2113> don't lie coldhead, you've been here since 11:59pm yesterday
[21:58:09] <tw2113> this is your 2nd day
[21:58:15] <jquerynoob> I don't understand how this works
[21:58:25] <jquerynoob> that's what I'm here to understand
[21:58:42] <Bankzilla> tw2113 lololololol
[21:59:02] <Bankzilla> jquerynoob, this is more based towards javascript though
[21:59:27] <Bankzilla> why are you trying to build a ball collision demo in javascript anyways?
[21:59:31] <coldhead> as someone suggest earlier :P
[21:59:37] <jquerynoob> alright, I'd just head to the javascript
[21:59:42] <tw2113> jQuery is javascript, javascript isn't jQuery
[22:00:03] <coldhead> also maybe #javascript-ball-physics
[22:00:10] <jquerynoob> Alright
[22:00:16] <coldhead> those guys are obsessed with balls
[22:00:18] <jquerynoob> No physics needed
[22:00:24] <tw2113> mmm balls
[22:00:30] <jquerynoob> but I'd just read the javascript tutorials anyway
[22:00:32] <jquerynoob> Thanks guys
[22:00:39] <Bankzilla> jquerynoob: i haven't read over this but this might work http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4230029/jquery-javascript-collision-detection
[22:02:00] <Eviltwin> jquerynoob: I'd suggest doing something like this: http://jsfiddle.net/5Y7gJ/
[22:02:28] <Eviltwin> Err
[22:02:35] <Eviltwin> WIthout the typo
[22:03:40] <yaazkal> Eviltwin, this is a previus version (the click event was working) and I can fade in/out between "slides" without problem. If you click you will see that the circle changes its color: http://alasdemariposa.com/test/w/
[22:04:02] <Eviltwin> http://jsfiddle.net/5Y7gJ/1/
[22:04:05] <Bankzilla> lol Eviltwin: that's trying to crash my browser
[22:04:31] <jquerynoob> wow, I'm going to take some time wrapping this around my heaed
[22:04:35] <jquerynoob> but these seem like good leads
[22:05:19] <raj> Eviltwin, also, do you think it's worth it to make sure people don't cheat?
[22:05:23] <raj> like is it that common?
[22:05:39] <jquerynoob> also, I don't think I'm going to use a jquery function to do this
[22:06:18] <jquerynoob> Eviltwin, the link you gave me
[22:06:25] <jquerynoob> I don't see the collision logic in it
[22:07:00] <thomas-`> Hi. How can i get the main html element on my page?
[22:07:19] <thomas-`> is $("html").get(0) reliable?
[22:09:03] * tw2113 says: try it and see
[22:09:28] <tw2113> $('html').html(); may work
[22:11:26] <Eviltwin> raj: Depends on how much you care about the ones who do
[22:11:31] <Eviltwin> jquerynoob: There's a lovely comment
[22:11:36] <Eviltwin> You said you had a strategy already
[22:11:41] <Eviltwin> Presumably that applies to the collision betwen two balls
[22:11:46] <yaazkal> Well, it's midnight. I'm going to sleep and come back tomorrow with my issue if someone can help me :) thanks
[22:11:51] <jquerynoob> Yes I did
[22:11:59] <yaazkal> Bye bye and thanks
[22:12:10] <jquerynoob> but I needed to know how the values of the positions of the two balls are passed
[22:12:16] <Eviltwin> tw2113: $('html').get(0) and $('html').html() do two very different things
[22:12:18] <jquerynoob> to the function that will determine if they collide or not
[22:12:36] <Eviltwin> jquerynoob: ball[i].x, ball[i].y, ball[h].x, ball[h].y
[22:12:43] <Eviltwin> Welcome to JavaScript
[22:13:06] <jquerynoob> hmm
[22:14:34] <tw2113> var h = $('html').get(0); got me <html lang="en-us">
[22:16:16] <thomas-`> tw2113, $("html").get(0) didnt work for me however $("html") does
[22:16:24] <thomas-`> but my argument is what if theres iframes on the page
[22:16:38] <tw2113> the one i did up gets you everything inside the <html> tag but not those tags themselves
[22:18:32] <Eviltwin> jquerynoob: The strategy I showed you is a pretty generic framework for newtonian physics
[22:18:40] <Eviltwin> Things have a position and a velocity
[22:18:50] <Eviltwin> And as time goes on, that position moves in the direction of the velocity
[22:19:02] <Eviltwin> How the velocity changes is up to your collision mechanism
[22:19:27] <Eviltwin> While there's a lot more code as well, this is built on top of that same framework: http://jsfiddle.net/XpJE4/show/
[22:19:34] <coldhead> i go to make myself ONE english muffin and Eviltwin starts dropping the n-bomb
[22:19:55] <jquerynoob> haha
[22:20:30] <jquerynoob> this is massively cool
[22:20:41] <mrittman> okay I am a noob
[22:20:48] <mrittman> anyone know why this simple animation isn't working?
[22:20:49] <mrittman> http://pastebin.com/QrafVVPK
[22:21:02] <Eviltwin> Those use more of a small-scale inverse-square repulsion
[22:21:11] <Eviltwin> Rather than a rigid body collision
[22:21:50] <mrittman> http://pastebin.com/eCfmw1cG
[22:22:18] <tw2113> fiddles would be better mrittman
[22:22:36] <Eviltwin> mrittman: http://jsfiddle.net/yTJ6w/
[22:22:51] <mrittman> thx
[22:23:29] <mrittman> so its obviously working
[22:23:34] <mrittman> but why not on my page...
[22:24:01] <Eviltwin> mrittman: Try adding $(function() { ... }) around it
[22:24:05] <Eviltwin> And see what happens
[22:24:27] <Eviltwin> Like this: http://jsfiddle.net/yTJ6w/1/
[22:25:52] <mrittman> that worked, thanks man :)

[22:27:45] <tw2113> i'd animate it back to full opacity on mouseout
[22:27:52] <coldhead> PINKING OUT THE DAY / DREAMING OUT THE CRAZY WAY
[22:28:12] <mrittman> yeah how do I do a mouseout?
[22:29:26] <tw2113> i would poke through coldhead's itunes library but i'd fear seeing celine dion and the bieber

[22:31:18] <coldhead> never for a moment could i forget her
[22:31:23] <mrittman> tw2113, how would I make it return on mouseout?

[22:35:16] <coldhead> he's admissible
[22:35:40] <coldhead> prrrog
[22:36:20] <Rax_> hello all
[22:36:43] <coldhead> hey Raxxy
[22:36:52] <Rax_> anyone online that knows query :)
[22:36:57] <Rax_> hello cold
[22:37:05] <tw2113> rex manning is here?!?!?
[22:37:14] <Rax_> Im wondering if their is a code that does something i like in flash ^^
[22:37:28] <coldhead> very likely, Rax_
[22:37:37] <coldhead> it's a golden age for retiring flash
[22:37:38] <Rax_> who should i ask ^^
[22:37:47] <coldhead> ask the channel
[22:37:55] <Rax_> -0 coding knowledge :P
[22:37:56] <coldhead> we're just talking about drummers anyway
[22:38:02] <Rax_> http://mstep.org/cosmax.swf
[22:38:11] <Rax_> thats the effect i <3 i found on the net
[22:38:18] <Rax_> but would rather have it as a code
[22:38:31] <Rax_> tried googling navigation and menu but no luck
[22:38:50] <coldhead> you could do this in CSS3 with transitions
[22:38:57] <raj> Eviltwin, how can I make sure the div is the correct height with the content, if the content isn't there until the $.post?
[22:39:24] <Rax_> besides the mouse over, glow effect its interactive which i relaly dig
[22:39:29] <coldhead> Rax_: check out this for starts http://greweb.fr/demo/css3/transition/navbar/
[22:39:48] <coldhead> you want the same kind of animations but on round things and with box-shadow for the glow
[22:39:51] <coldhead> totes do-able
[22:40:23] <Rax_> well i can live without the glow, the interactive mouse location is the plus
[22:40:32] <Rax_> <--gfx guy ^^
[22:40:59] <coldhead> if you're going to do it yourself you'll need to learn some basic CSS3 and transitions
[22:41:10] <coldhead> but its nothing taxing
[22:41:12] <tw2113> transitions and animations
[22:41:18] <coldhead> gypsies could do it
[22:41:25] <Rax_> once i see basic scripts i have coders who i do gfx for that might be able to help
[22:41:33] <Rax_> i just need the raw codes to add together
[22:41:35] <mrittman> http://www.phillipsfloors.com/
[22:41:51] <mrittman> if you hover over the logo, a menu slides out
[22:41:58] <coldhead> view the source here, Rax_ http://greweb.fr/demo/css3/transition/navbar/
[22:42:01] <Rax_> im a moment person, idea poped into my head. want to get as much done as i can before the next one pops up
[22:42:15] <mrittman> but when you try to click one, it goes back in
[22:42:43] <Rax_> i get the mouseover+ trans+ exp. but i can find anything for being interactive based on mouse
[22:42:46] <Rax_> only 3d spheres
[22:43:32] <mrittman> anyone know how I can fix this?
[22:43:45] <coldhead> ooh i see, it follows the mouse
[22:43:53] <coldhead> that's probably gonna take some JS
[22:43:58] <coldhead> as well as the CSS
[22:44:07] <Rax_> hence im here :P

[22:44:28] <Rax_> http://tympanus.net/Tutorials/BubbleNavigation/

[22:44:39] <jquerynoob> http://jsbin.com/imofat/89/edit#javascript,live
[22:44:44] <jquerynoob> this isn't working
[22:44:44] <Rax_> or interactive
[22:44:48] <jquerynoob> can someone tell me what's wrong with it?
[22:45:01] <mrittman> poopy
[22:45:12] <jquerynoob> http://jsbin.com/imofat/92/
[22:45:29] <jquerynoob> it's the same bouncing ball problem where I'm trying to implement collision detection
[22:47:49] <coldhead> Rax_: http://www.suburban-glory.com/blog?page=114
[22:47:57] <coldhead> just google for css3 glow
[22:48:02] <coldhead> lots of coverage
[22:48:23] <Rax_> you know any premade things close to it by any chance :) ?
[22:48:36] <Whirl3d> jquerynoob, are you even using jquery?
[22:48:44] <jquerynoob> Nope

[23:08:10] <jonkersjoe> hey guys, is there a method that you use to convert multi-line of text to a single line of text ?  I'm trying to get a bunch of html tags into a variable, and i've pre-designed the elements in another file.
[23:08:12] <jonkersjoe> ?
[23:09:32] <systemfault> I use vim :P So it's easy
[23:11:18] <jonkersjoe> i;m using komodo on a mac
[23:11:34] <tw2113> i know sublime text has a command to put all on one line
[23:11:47] <martinciscap2> im using sublime text 2
[23:11:48] <jonkersjoe> I'm currently copying and pasting into a chrome address line and copying again
[23:12:21] <jonkersjoe> not sure how much the address bar can handle
[23:12:26] <martinciscap2> but i dont know how to do that sorry :S
[23:12:44] <jonkersjoe> ok thanks, whats sublime text ?
[23:13:11] <systemfault> Probably the best "normal" text editor you can getâ€¦
[23:13:13] <martinciscap2> an editor
[23:13:18] <Rax_> well im off thanks again night all
[23:13:26] <systemfault> not normal being "vim and emacs"
[23:13:27] <martinciscap2> night rax_
[23:13:41] * tw2113 suggests to download http://www.sublimetext.com/ for all your text editor needs
[23:14:01] <systemfault> It's not free.. so some people might not like it :P
[23:14:15] <tw2113> it's worth it though
[23:14:21] <systemfault> (I don't personally mind paying for a good tool.. my time is worth a lot more than 50$)
[23:14:44] <jonkersjoe> ahh right, I'm just downlonading it
[23:15:29] <jonkersjoe> I've purchased komodo thinking that it is the only good editor for mac, I'll give this a shot
[23:15:31] <systemfault> tw2113: You use version 2?
[23:15:45] <systemfault> jonkersjoe: komodo editor is free :/
[23:15:55] <tw2113> sublime text 2 beta build: 2181
[23:15:55] <systemfault> komodo IDE isn't.
[23:16:20] <systemfault> Isn't textmate still the cool OSX editor?
[23:16:35] <jonkersjoe> systemfault: There's a free version and a paid version
[23:17:00] <LoneStar99> hola amigos y amigas
[23:17:07] <systemfault> I never tried sublime text because I didn't know it's available on OSX
[23:17:40] <martinciscap2> i think sublime started for OSX xD
[23:17:45] <bokgroll> Hi. Any idea where I can get some nice jquery windows? I mean proper windows you can maximize, minimize, restore, resize, move, close, tile and cascade, etc.
[23:18:00] <martinciscap2> jqueryUI
[23:18:05] <bokgroll> couldn't find any
[23:18:15] <tw2113> all the cool stuff works on OSX
[23:18:21] <martinciscap2> bokgroll do you try jqueryUI?
[23:18:24] <tw2113> linux and windows are lucky if they get a build
[23:18:33] <martinciscap2> im using windows hehe
[23:18:38] <tw2113> and i linux
[23:18:46] <jonkersjoe> tw2113:  not really, there's a tonne of stuff for windows
[23:18:59] <martinciscap2> i use to have a mac but haha beer in my keyboard and u know what xD
[23:19:00] <tw2113> i said cool stuff
[23:19:05] <martinciscap2> so i gifted to my bro
[23:19:07] <tw2113> not "stuff"
[23:19:35] <logiclord> I am trying to get a zip file using jquery.ajax and it works fine in Firefox/Chrome but in Internet explorer 10 I get just starting 10-20 bytes of zip file http://pastebin.com/LF19PV8D .. any idea why ?
[23:19:54] <martinciscap2> cause is IE! x_X
[23:19:55] <jonkersjoe> ok, not really. There are tonne of "cool" stuff on windows that's not on macâ€¦ it gets frustrating
[23:20:14] <systemfault> Like?
[23:20:43] <martinciscap2> like the clip in word! :O
[23:20:47] <martinciscap2> xD
[23:20:48] <ProLoser|Mac> hallo
[23:20:49] <systemfault> Ah, right!
[23:20:53] <ProLoser|Mac> wrap() isn't working for me
[23:20:56] <ProLoser|Mac> :(
[23:21:56] <jonkersjoe> I don't think I can name them, however, there's been times when I've looked for tools where its written for windows. but I'm using a mac, and have to make do with what ever is there, even if I don't like it
[23:22:46] <martinciscap2> jonkersjoe why don you try making a virtual windows?
[23:23:13] <LoneStar99> why does the following code work fine as is. but if the input boxes are on a div from a ajax request page, the jquery behaviors do not work...  http://jsfiddle.net/hwdy/rpWmT/1/
[23:23:17] <martinciscap2> or a virtual linux with wine and then walla! the best OS xD
[23:23:50] <jonkersjoe> martinciscap2: Yeah I have had to do that, I have vmware on this mac if i need something urgently. however, not really a big fan of running vmware on a macbook pro with tonne of things open.
[23:23:51] <systemfault> Or use OSX...
[23:25:02] <martinciscap2> yeah i understand..
[23:25:16] <martinciscap2> LoneStar99
[23:25:22] <martinciscap2> you have to try with live
[23:25:31] <systemfault> live is dead
[23:25:39] <systemfault> .on is the new drug
[23:25:41] <martinciscap2> why? :S
[23:25:46] <LoneStar99> martinciscap2:  live?
[23:26:00] <martinciscap2> yeah but systemfault say that .on is better
[23:26:15] <martinciscap2> i dont know how to work with on so...systemfault could you explain us?
[23:26:29] <LoneStar99> yeah .on ...
[23:26:41] <systemfault> You can use .on in two ways
[23:26:50] <systemfault> the first way is like .bind
[23:27:13] <systemfault> $(selector).on('click', function(){ dowathever(); });
[23:27:59] <systemfault> To use .on like live, you would do: $(document).on('click', selector, function() { dowhatever(); });
[23:28:12] <martinciscap2> Lonestar99 ... using .live ... http://jsfiddle.net/rpWmT/3/
[23:28:23] <Trisox> $("#selector").on('click', selector, function() { dowhatever(); }); also
[23:28:43] <Trisox> but thats delegating right
[23:28:48] <martinciscap2> but...
[23:29:01] <martinciscap2> .on has better performance than .live or what?
[23:29:02] <martinciscap2> :S
[23:29:02] <Trisox> ass
[23:29:05] <Trisox> :D
[23:29:12] <systemfault> martinciscap2: Same thingâ€¦ .live calls .on IIRC
[23:29:27] <sacho> martinciscap2, live et al are all deprecated. on simply has all their functionality.
[23:29:29] <LoneStar99> martinciscap2: let me try your "live" on my code..brb
[23:29:30] <systemfault> martinciscap2: It's just that eventuallyâ€¦ they'll deprecate .bind .live and .delegate
[23:29:36] <Trisox> deprecated indeed
[23:29:46] <sacho> well yeah, they're not marked as deprecated yet, but functionally.
[23:30:15] <martinciscap2> ok thanx then i need to move some of my code to .on
[23:30:18] <LoneStar99> systemfault: so would "$("input").on('keyup',function(event) { ... }); br right?
[23:30:20] <systemfault> So.. why not make your code future proof ;)
[23:30:33] <systemfault> LoneStar99: No, that's regular binding
[23:30:43] <Trisox> :D
[23:31:40] <LoneStar99>  $("input").on('keyup', selector, function(){ .. }); ??
[23:31:46] <systemfault> http://jsfiddle.net/rpWmT/4/ martinciscap2's code with .on
[23:31:47] <Trisox> i also like the live bind stuff beter but hey change of somethings you have to folow ;) like water folow's the path down a river :p
[23:32:07] <sacho> "live bind stuff"?
[23:32:09] <systemfault> $(document).on('keyup', 'input', function(){});
[23:32:13] <sacho> you can do it with on just as well..
[23:32:16] <Trisox> yes
[23:32:45] <sacho> there's a reason the syntax has evolved this way. The other ways tend to have inefficient steps in them.
[23:33:40] <LoneStar99> systemfault: ok let me try that
[23:34:34] <systemfault> LoneStar99: For best resultsâ€¦ instead of "document", use the common parent node of the elements
[23:34:49] <Zhy> concerning live and on: If I have multiple binds like $(sel1).live(function() {}) $(sel2).live(function(){})
[23:35:08] <Zhy> ah imagine a 'click' before the function in my above sentence^^
[23:35:26] <Zhy> with on would that be $(document).on('click', $(sel1), function(){}) ?
[23:36:19] <systemfault> Zhy: I don't know if that worksâ€¦ I never used anything but selectors for the second argument.
[23:36:45] <Zhy> like what for example? Now I'm confused as to what selectors are :O
[23:37:00] <systemfault> Zhy: A string containing a CSS selector
[23:37:03] <LoneStar99> systemfault: ok your code worked,  will work on the "parent node' fix
[23:37:07] <systemfault> ".foo"
[23:37:12] <Zhy> ahhh
[23:37:49] <Zhy> ok thanks, that's what I meant with $(sel1) ^^ good to know it'd just be sel1  (lik '#bla' ,'.anything'
[23:38:14] <Zhy> But that would be the way to substitute live binds, right ?
[23:38:20] <systemfault> Yes
[23:39:10] <Zhy> okay thanks :)
[23:39:19] <LoneStar99> systemfault thanks 4 your help
[23:39:30] <systemfault> You're welcome :)
[23:42:39] <LoneStar99> sytemfault $(".rts-nts-tbx").on('keyup', 'input', function(event){  }); ??
[23:42:53] <systemfault> Yeah
[23:43:02] <LoneStar99> ok thanks
[23:43:21] <systemfault> If .rts-nts-tbx is a common ancestor
[23:45:12] <martinciscap2> Lonestar99 why youre wrapping each input in a div?
[23:46:32] <sa2304> Hi everybody, is it possible to stop blur event or return focus after blur? http://jsfiddle.net/NTbPB/4/
[23:47:43] <sacho> put a timeout between the handler and firing the focus event
[23:47:56] <martinciscap2> i found that the .live is slower than .on
[23:48:33] <sa2304> thanks, so it's really impossible without a timeout?
[23:49:31] <sacho> Well, I don't want to say impossible - I don't even know why you need a timeout
[23:49:33] <sacho> http://jsfiddle.net/NTbPB/5/
[23:49:53] <sacho> Gotta reread the specs on this issue. :|
[23:51:23] <sa2304> thanks I thought "return false" or event.preventDefault() should work )
[23:51:41] <Zhy> Hmm after trying to save data via ajax I want to grab all input error messages and put them in a div above the inputs. Firebug even shows that the elements are there, but they're not visible on the page and in firebug they're greyed out
[23:51:46] <Zhy> anyone an idea why that might be ?
[23:52:01] <martinciscap2> sancho you make an uneditable jsfiddle xD
[23:53:26] <LoneStar99> martinciscap2: yes why?
[23:54:09] <LoneStar99> martinciscap2:  yes wrapping inputs in divs...
[23:54:55] <martinciscap2> Lonestar99 haha forget it im just getting sleep xD
[23:55:21] <martinciscap2> sa2304 i understand that you need this---> http://jsfiddle.net/NTbPB/8/
[23:55:40] <LoneStar99> martinciscap2:  yeah, original code needs alot of styling so inputs are in divs
[23:56:11] <martinciscap2> Lonestar99 ok i understand :D... hey your code its working now?
[23:56:54] <sa2304> martinciscap2: yes, but it does not work for me )
[23:57:06] <LoneStar99> yeah, just need to see why using $(".foo") instead of $(document) is not working
[23:57:44] <LoneStar99> but have interview in morning so, need to stop coding for the night
[23:58:04] <systemfault> Hmm, sublime text 2 is very nice
[23:58:21] <martinciscap2> yeah your right lonestar99
[23:58:26] <ravenzz> how good it is for big projects?
[23:58:28] <martinciscap2> i told you systemfault hehe
[23:58:45] <martinciscap2> its really cool when you install the package controller
[23:58:49] <systemfault> Its JS indentation support is perfect
[23:59:03] <martinciscap2> try installing jquery support :D
[23:59:13] <martinciscap2> and the JS minimizer ;)
[23:59:31] <martinciscap2> well i gotta go... need to sleep
[23:59:39] <systemfault> Later
