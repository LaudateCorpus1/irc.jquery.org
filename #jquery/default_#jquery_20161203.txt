[06:54:45] <randomnoob> Hello guys I need your help. I am totally noob about this. Look at this code http://jsfiddle.net/X9tgY/1464/ . I have right click context menu. I want when clicked on menu item it took id="1" tag in it.
[15:41:50] <hongkongphooey> why does ajax throw an error instead of just returning empty results, it makes things more difficult look at this simple example: http://pastebin.com/gXiXx7Az , what if result2 is 400() half the time, what's an elegant way to write a conditional ajax call that isn't needlessly complex?
[15:42:13] <systemfault> Well
[15:42:31] <systemfault> Do they need to be done one after the other or both can be done at the same time√â
[15:42:32] <systemfault> ?
[15:44:52] <hongkongphooey> systemfault: same time i guess, doesn't matter
[15:45:18] <systemfault> What do you want to do when you get a 400?
[15:46:37] <hongkongphooey> systemfault: just proceed with the rest of the code, but the error stops everything
[15:48:38] <systemfault> hongkongphooey: What version of jQuery?
[15:48:54] <hongkongphooey> systemfault: the latest version
[15:48:59] <systemfault> 3.x?
[15:49:08] <hongkongphooey> systemfault: yes
[15:49:26] <systemfault> hongkongphooey: I would try something like http://pastebin.com/rW851Uyt
[15:50:00] <hongkongphooey> i cant use promises for this
[15:50:04] <systemfault> lol
[15:50:09] <systemfault> Artificial requirement?
[15:53:24] <hongkongphooey> systemfault: no i tried ot use bluebird with chrome extensions and it wouldn't work so i'm just doing everythnig with callbacks
[15:55:04] <systemfault> Then use $.ajax directly, it gives you a way to specify a error and a complete callback
[15:56:48] <hongkongphooey> systemfault: yeah i thought i could avoid that somehow, thanks a lot for the help
[15:57:09] <systemfault> $.get is really just a facade on top of $.ajax to make it easier to do
[15:57:11] <systemfault> *use
[15:57:16] <shoky> systemfault's paste doesn't use any bluebird promises..
[16:05:26] <hongkongphooey> shoky: idk i remember trying to use promises with chrome extensions and it's just problem after problem so i avoided them, it's simple enough of a project that they arent necessary
[16:05:50] <hongkongphooey> systemfault: see with this i have to put the rest of the code in a function and put it in two places right (success and error handlers) http://pastebin.com/yfBh8aJA
[16:06:46] <systemfault> Like I said.. if you don't care about the result, there's a 'complete' callback IIRC
[16:07:52] <hongkongphooey> systemfault: oh, let me try tht
[16:24:23] <hongkongphooey> systemfault: nice, that fixed everything, thanks!
[17:33:44] <tobj> hello, anyone familiar with plupload?
[18:12:57] <Hubbah> Hi quick question. By following these instructions ( http://stackoverflow.com/a/9762801 ) doesnt that mean that i have to submit the form ? Or will the $.post update in real time?
[18:27:54] <shoky> Hubbah: they are using the 'change' event of the input field to trigger the ajax. no form is submitted
[18:30:28] <Hubbah> Ah thanks shoky !
[19:01:24] <Poppa> yo, how would one go about using the same datatable for multiple data src's depending on conditions ?
[20:02:07] <Hubbah> What jquery function would i use if i'd like to check if a specific string has appeared by random in my content?
