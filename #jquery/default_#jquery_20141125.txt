[00:02:45] <Cork> norc: untested, but it should work http://jsfiddle.net/7jdeemeo/8/
[00:03:11] <Cork> except for typo...
[00:03:20] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/7jdeemeo/9/
[00:08:05] <norc> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/7jdeemeo/10/  fixed the classes, and made it a test case. Does not work tho.
[00:09:53] <Cork> ugg, ya i'm stupid...
[00:10:49] <Cork> one min let me fix this
[00:16:40] <Cork> norc: http://jsfiddle.net/7jdeemeo/11/
[00:16:56] <Cork> you need to make sure you change all the class refereces when you do :)
[00:17:03] <Cork> and don't mix td and th
[00:17:10] <Cork> the selector gets cranky ^^'
[00:17:55] <norc> Cork: Yeah. What is that selector on td.toggleColumn in the beginning?
[00:18:23] <Cork> it grabs all toggle columns and toggles them
[00:18:37] <Cork> then grabs the first in the list and grabs its new state (visible/hidden)
[00:18:45] <Cork> the each loop then loops all table headers
[00:18:50] <Cork> and set them to that state
[00:18:55] <norc> Which makes it a global flag then?
[00:19:05] <Cork> global for all tables yes
[00:19:31] <Cork> i took it that is what you wanted
[00:19:45] <Cork> all it saves is the state, not what column it is
[00:20:27] <Cork> might be better to split line 2 into two
[00:20:35] <Cork> so it syncs all tables if they get out of sync
[00:21:04] <Cork> norc:
[00:21:04] <Cork> <Cork> so it syncs all tables if they get out of sync
[00:21:06] <Cork> opps
[00:21:11] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/7jdeemeo/12/
[00:21:33] <Cork> opps wrong
[00:21:42] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/7jdeemeo/13/
[00:22:15] <norc> Cork: Ohh, this makes perfect sense now.
[00:30:33] <norc> Cork: Okay this looks quite amazing. Ill have to do some work to adapt it to my exact needs, but I think I have ag reat start here. Thanks a bunch.
[00:31:26] <Cork> norc: yw
[01:04:27] <Solcero> is it possible to use .replaceWith 2 times in the same function - the first one replace the div - the second one dont work
[01:04:51] <Cork> Solcero: no as you remove the element the first time
[01:05:00] <Cork> so what you replace the second time isn't in the dom
[01:05:08] <Cork> Solcero: what are you trying to do?
[01:05:32] <Solcero> i want to show a message something like start - stop
[01:05:47] <Cork> Solcero: so set it in the element instead of replacing it
[01:07:11] <Solcero> ok thx
[02:14:00] <DaniG2k> hello all
[02:14:16] <DaniG2k> can someone please help me debug a tiny issue which I think is jQuery related?
[02:14:26] <DaniG2k> can't seem to figure out the cause
[02:15:13] <DaniG2k> I'm using stickUp.js (http://lirancohen.github.io/stickUp/ ) on my website
[02:15:43] <DaniG2k> and when I click the links on the bar with Firefox, it over-scrolls on some links
[02:21:23] <jikuja> DaniG2k: works for me. Which links does that?
[02:21:55] <DaniG2k> jikuja: if you go to my website: http://danielepestilli.com
[02:22:05] <DaniG2k> using firefox
[02:22:24] <DaniG2k> make your page like half width (enough so that the menu collapses into two rows
[02:22:34] <DaniG2k> if you click Home and then click Technical Skills
[02:22:41] <DaniG2k> it scrolls over the title text
[02:22:58] <DaniG2k> this doesn't happen if the page is full width
[02:23:38] <DaniG2k> it's only happening when the top nav bar doubles up
[02:26:40] <jikuja> DaniG2k: you need to update div#content's margin-top if navbar is bigger
[02:30:10] <DaniG2k> jikuja: you mean container?
[02:30:24] <jikuja> DaniG2k: in your site it's div#wrapper if I'm reading correctly
[02:31:01] <lilsammy> How can I select the previous element (h2 tag no ID no class) by the next element which has an ID
[02:31:19] <DaniG2k> yeah div#wrapper
[02:31:57] <jikuja> DaniG2k: if you follow that div in inspector you see how it changes its top-padding. 60px is for one row navbar
[02:33:17] <DaniG2k> jikuja: yea the spHeight class is the one adding padding
[02:33:52] <jikuja> just don't ask how to fix that:P
[02:34:20] <DaniG2k> jikuja: I had already set this to 0px for smaller devices (iPhone 4, 5, 6)
[02:34:24] <DaniG2k> so it works on those
[02:35:10] <DaniG2k> and it gets updated with if (vartop < varscroll + topMargin) { $('.wrapper').addClass('spHeight');
[02:35:16] <DaniG2k> if (varscroll + topMargin < vartop) { $('.wrapper').removeClass('spHeight');
[02:35:24] <DaniG2k> which I added to stickUp.js
[02:35:43] <DaniG2k> jikuja: as you can see here: https://gist.github.com/DaniG2k/6078582cf2f49c1950a4
[02:39:13] <jikuja> DaniG2k: you could check size of the ul.nav when setting spHeight
[02:40:50] <DaniG2k> jikuja: yeah
[02:40:55] <DaniG2k> jikuja:that's probably it
[02:41:31] <krz> i have the following url string "/auth/twitter?use_authorize=true&origin=dashboard-add-profile&foobar=true" how do i change the the params value of foobar to false?
[02:41:49] <krz> ie "/auth/twitter?use_authorize=true&origin=dashboard-add-profile&foobar=false"
[02:42:03] <krz> whats the best way to  go about this?
[02:49:07] <krz> anyone?
[02:49:39] <Erwat> krz: depends on what you want to do overall
[02:50:10] <Erwat> the *easiest* in this case would be to find the value of "foobar=" and change the result of it
[02:50:23] <Erwat> using regex or similar
[02:50:48] <krz> Erwat: how with regex?
[02:50:53] <Erwat> if you want to do it *right* you should go through the values after "?"
[02:51:19] <Erwat> krz: sorry i suck at regex
[02:52:39] <shcrl2224> Since backbone uses jquery internally: I have a backbone view, howver, the html markup it refers to ($el and its children), is added to the DOM after pageload. How do I observe events on such elements in my view? I bascially want jquery's .on() delegate function for Backbone. Thanks!
[02:55:50] <garethdaine> Guys, any of you using Redactor?
[03:02:31] <xec> ?ask @ garethdaine
[03:02:31] <b-ot> garethdaine: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[03:02:45] <garethdaine> That was a question
[03:03:13] <xec> it's a question looking for topic experts. what are you trying to do?
[03:04:06] <garethdaine> Find topic experts…
[03:04:11] <garethdaine> Only kidding
[03:04:25] <xec> garethdaine: maybe someone is using redactor, maybe not. noone will be able to help without a proper question
[03:05:26] <garethdaine> OK, so I’ve just upgraded Redactor to version 10.0.5 and everything is almost working except for the fact that when I add the plugins: [‘table’] option, it breaks
[03:06:36] <garethdaine> Just worked it out
[03:06:46] <garethdaine> They’ve now split the plugins from the main JS file
[03:06:48] <garethdaine> Doh!
[03:14:31] <heythere> hey there
[03:15:19] <heythere> anyone can help me out with this? http://jsfiddle.net/ad0xo5ya/ can't seem to make it work on jsfiddle for some reason.. althoug the external resources are there... well my problem is that it returns the id when I select something but I want it to return a string with the item.name actually instead of the id. Thanks
[03:16:28] <Uhkis> Error: Option 'data' is not allowed for Select2 when attached to a <select> element.
[03:17:16] <heythere> http://jsfiddle.net/ad0xo5ya/1/
[03:17:24] <heythere> ye fixed it here you can see a working example
[03:18:10] <Cork> heythere: use $(this).find(':selected')
[03:18:12] <Cork> opps
[03:18:16] <Cork> heythere: use $(this).find(':selected').text()
[03:19:15] <Cork> except select2 breaks that
[03:19:45] <heythere> ye <:
[03:20:49] <heythere> http://jsfiddle.net/ad0xo5ya/2/ ive updated it to this but it returns null?
[03:21:46] <Uhkis> http://jsfiddle.net/ad0xo5ya/3/
[03:21:52] <Uhkis> very hacky but works :D
[03:24:05] <heythere> hmm Uhkis how can I pass that back to #Number?
[03:25:02] <Cork> less hacky http://jsfiddle.net/ad0xo5ya/4/
[03:25:46] <heythere> cheers thanks a lot Cork and Uhkis
[03:25:46] <heythere> :)
[03:25:47] <Uhkis> Cork: you actually opened select2 docs?
[03:25:55] <Cork> Uhkis: nope
[03:26:05] <Cork> just did console.log($(this).data())
[03:26:10] <Cork> and poked around
[03:27:01] <Cork> it does include padding that select2 adds though
[03:27:07] <Cork> but a simple trim should fix that
[03:27:57] <Cork> you can access the original results from there too
[03:28:06] <Cork> and a few other quite nifty things
[03:29:13] <heythere> thanks :) ill try it now on the webcrap am trying to develop xD
[03:29:30] <Cork> heythere: though you might want to have a look in there docks
[03:29:41] <Cork> they might have an official solution to do this
[03:29:47] <Cork> like a function or something
[03:30:01] <heythere> well I had and their documentation is quite weird... it includes a lot of things I couldnt figure out how to do it... had like 2-3 hours look before I decided to come here for the easy answer tbh
[03:30:04] <Uhkis> ok now i found it
[03:30:07] <heythere> cause thats the only way to learn
[03:30:26] <Uhkis> Cork: thanks for the debugging lesson
[03:30:32] <Cork> heh
[03:30:43] <Cork> this isn't debugging though :)
[03:30:44] <Cork> more hacking
[03:31:02] <Cork> greasemonkey makes you look into things like this :)
[03:31:07] <shcrl2224> hi guys, which jquery based ui widget library you have good experience with?
[03:31:07] <Uhkis> still priceless information!
[03:31:17] <shcrl2224> that you would recommend it to others.thanks
[03:31:35] <Cork> shcrl2224: i would go with jquery ui every time
[03:31:49] <Cork> form what i've experienced this far it is the most flexible one
[03:31:57] <Cork> it doesn't give you very much out of the box
[03:32:12] <Cork> but you never end up against a brick wall "here but no further"
[03:32:19] <Cork> and that's a BIG win for me
[03:32:33] <shcrl2224> it should also be usuable in a closed source project.
[03:32:40] <shcrl2224> as far as the licensing goes.
[03:33:48] <Cork> shcrl2224: ui uses the same license as jquery
[03:33:53] <Cork> so that shouldn't be a problem
[03:34:00] <Cork> (developed by the same team after all)
[03:35:03] <shcrl2224> i see
[03:35:07] <shcrl2224> are you from Cork Cork? lol
[03:35:12] <Cork> no
[03:35:34] <shcrl2224> i'm probably not the first to ask that.
[03:35:45] <Cork> this is an old nick based on a swedish comedy song :)
[03:35:54] <Cork> ya, you're not
[03:36:14] <Cork> i've gotten some quite weird questions over the years
[03:36:20] <shcrl2224> such as? lol
[03:36:48] <Cork> such as politic questions
[03:36:54] <Cork> where the asker just assumed
[03:37:13] <Cork> and i don't remember them all
[03:38:34] <shcrl2224>  i see
[03:38:45] <shcrl2224> is there any jquery competitor?
[03:38:50] <shcrl2224> i've never thought about that
[03:38:53] <shcrl2224> hence the question
[03:39:08] <Cork> sure
[03:39:43] <Cork> zepto.js for example
[03:40:22] <Cork> and then there is completely different frameworks like prototype, extjs or yui
[03:40:31] <Cork> (and many many more)
[03:43:06] <shcrl2224> after taking a glance at zepto
[03:43:14] <shcrl2224> being lightweight is their argument
[03:43:17] <shcrl2224> as it seems
[03:48:48] <shcrl2224> Cork, do you happen to have experience with JAX-RS?
[03:49:18] <Cork> heard of it
[03:49:30] <Cork> but i'm not mush of a java guy so not used it
[03:49:46] <Cork> (use java for android, but stay away from it as much as i can for everything else)
[03:57:36] * CssNoob good evening y'all
[03:57:52] <shcrl2224> hi CssNoob
[03:59:22] <Ritzton> Hello
[04:00:20] <Ritzton> Would you need jquery lib for mooving a object from one div to another with an animation ? (kind of that http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9153147/is-it-possible-to-move-the-text-from-an-element-to-another-using-jquery-animatio)
[04:00:50] <Cork> Ritzton: are you asking if it can be done without jquery or?
[04:01:31] <Ritzton> no I am asking if there is a lib for what I want to do, recoding the wheel is useless
[04:02:17] <Cork> well, you can animate a movement of an element
[04:02:30] <Cork> you would just have to figure our where the new location would be
[04:02:41] <Cork> then animate there and then change the dom position
[04:03:01] <Cork> (placeholders is most likely the simplest solution to do this)
[04:04:30] <Ritzton> yeah Cork I know, but you have to take in consideration mobile and tablet view for mobile etc... I was just wondering if there is a lib with a function which would take 3 parameters : "the object I want to moove", "the target div", "the type of animation"
[04:04:54] <Cork> Ritzton: might be; google is your friend
[04:05:51] <Ritzton> I already tried google that's why I am asking here :-)
[04:21:26] <baako> hi guys. i have some delete button. name as delete1 delete2 delete3 those button are create via php loop for each of my records. let say i click on delete1 how do i get that value?
[04:22:09] <Cork> baako: best solution is to store a data-index="<num>" on each button
[04:22:16] <Cork> then you don't have to parse random content
[04:23:27] <baako> Cork: what do you mean?
[04:23:44] <Cork> <button data-index="2">Delete 3</button>
[04:23:53] <Cork> except the same number -_-'
[04:28:55] <baako> Cork: if i have data-index="2", data-index="3", data-index="4",
[04:29:21] <Cork> uh you mean on the same element?
[04:30:06] <baako> thats what you mean right? have data-index with different number?
[04:30:26] <Cork> you said you have one button for each record
[04:30:36] <baako> yes
[04:30:37] <Cork> add the attribute to that button
[04:31:13] <Cork> $(parent).on('click', 'button', function() { $(this).data('index') });
[04:31:13] <baako> and how will i know which button has been clicked?
[04:31:34] <Cork> i love to answer questions before they are asked :D
[04:34:02] <baako> Cork: lol echo '<td><button name="delete' .escape($alluser->id) . '" value="' .escape($alluser->id) . '" data-index=".escape($alluser->id) .">>Delete</button></td>';
[04:34:14] <t4nk576> I have a UL with three LI. When I drop an element onto drop place  it creates a new LI node. This new LI node needs to allow other similar elements to be dropped on it but it isn't recognized as droppable. How do I update the DOM or the jQuery object to know that the new nodes are droppable?  I've looked at .bind(), .live(), and a few other API pages but I can't seem to get it to work no matter what I try.  Thanks
[04:34:26] <Cork> baako: is this button meant to submit a form?
[04:35:17] <baako> cork it is a delete button
[04:35:29] <Cork> doesn't answer the question
[04:35:31] <baako> i want to do it using jquery
[04:35:44] <baako> it aint in a form Cork
[04:35:51] <baako> so its not a submit button
[04:35:54] <Cork> then why are you setting a name field?
[04:36:42] <Cork> the name attribute only has meaning for form elements inside a form
[04:36:57] <baako> okay Cork cheers
[04:37:33] <Cork> baako: also i would prob set the id on the tr instead of the delete button
[04:37:49] <Cork> then you are free to reference it a bit easier if you ever need it for something beside the delete button
[04:38:22] <Cork> (and you can easily enough reach it from the button)
[04:38:26] <baako> Cork: i am gonna have a delete and edit
[04:38:38] <Cork> and edit is going to need the id too right?
[04:38:46] <baako> yea
[04:38:50] <Cork> there you go :)
[04:38:57] <Cork> so put it on the tr instead
[04:39:13] <Cork> $(this).closest('tr').data('index') (or id if you prefer)
[04:40:21] <baako> Cork: so <td data-index="'.escape($alluser->id) .'" value="'.escape($alluser->id) .'"><button> </button>
[04:40:28] <Cork> tr not td
[04:40:48] <Cork> unless you have more then one database row per table row
[04:41:23] <baako> Cork: they are over 10 records getting display
[04:42:13] <Cork> baako: ok this is what i meant as the end result: <tr data-index="5"><td></td>...<td><button></button><button></button></td></tr>
[04:42:41] <Cork> that assumes you don't build the table horizontally instead of vertically though
[04:43:20] <Cork> or *rather horizontally and not*
[04:43:51] <baako> Cork: its just a normal html table
[04:44:01] <Cork> baako: uh, ya?
[04:44:25] <Cork> baako: it is normally a good idea to put the data where it belongs instead of where you need it right now
[04:44:40] <Cork> it normally means you don't have to search to find where it is if you need it again
[04:44:53] <Cork> or forces you to repeat the same data all over the place
[04:45:13] <baako> Cork: so i shouldnt put it in tr?
[04:45:17] <Cork> so if each row of the table matches a row in the database, that is where you should put it
[04:45:29] <baako> Cork: yes
[04:45:49] <Cork> don't have enough info to say you should, but if what i've asked is true
[04:45:55] <Cork> it is the most logical place to put it
[04:45:59] <baako> Cork: http://pastebin.com/fA1qb7JL
[04:46:24] <Cork> ok, then ya you can't in on tr
[04:46:37] <Cork> makes for the easiest place to find it
[04:46:45] <Cork> (also you don't need it as value on button)
[04:46:56] <Cork> as again it isn't a form element
[04:47:08] <Cork> give the button a class though
[04:47:21] <Cork> so you can know what type of button it is (ex delete, or edit)
[04:47:46] <Cork> baako: btw you have tbody inside the each loop
[04:47:54] <Cork> you most likely want to move that outside :)
[04:49:26] <baako> cork so i added a class called deleteuser
[04:49:42] <baako> i have more the data-index back into the button
[04:49:57] <Cork> uh what?
[04:50:28] <baako> Cork: http://pastebin.com/JJAkBrWe
[04:50:42] <Cork> $('table').on('click', '.deleteuser', function() { removeUser($(this).closest('tr').data('index')); })
[04:50:57] <Cork> that is how you give the button life if you did what i suggested
[04:51:15] <Cork> and $('table').on('click', '.edituser', function() { editUser($(this).closest('tr').data('index')); }) for edit
[04:51:32] <Rlhplr> hello
[04:51:47] <Cork> "removeUser" and "editUser" is just placeholders for the code to actually do something with the index
[04:52:40] <baako> Cork: what is "removeUser"?
[04:52:54] <Cork> ... read the line i just typed
[04:53:12] <baako> Cork: again u did it
[04:56:22] <baako> Cork: on firebug it says removeUser is not defined
[04:56:33] <Cork> ya... cause it is placeholder
[04:56:37] <baako> when i click on tthe delete button
[04:56:52] <Cork> meaning psudo code, that you need to replace with what ever you want to do with the id
[04:57:26] <baako> cork i need to get whatever value it is getting passed
[04:57:41] <Cork> uh what?
[04:58:37] <baako> Cork: i need to get is in data-index so i can then do an ajax request to a php page to delete
[04:58:54] <Cork> well you have the id
[04:59:03] <Cork> you have to make the ajax call you're self
[04:59:51] <baako> Cork: so in the ajax "data" i will pass ign removeUser
[05:00:04] <Cork> no
[05:00:11] <Cork> you pass in the index
[05:00:32] <Cork> baako: the argument i passed to removeUser is the index you want
[05:00:37] <Cork> that is what the code meant to show
[05:06:42] <baako> Cork: it is will data am abit confused now sorry. so if i say data:index:index will get the value in data-index?
[05:06:54] <Rlhplr> http://jsfiddle.net/pgh7wre9/
[05:06:59] <Rlhplr> http://www.jtable.org/ApiReference/Actions#act-listAction
[05:07:43] <Cork> not sure what you mean
[05:07:50] <Rlhplr> Someone know how is possible to set the jtStartIndex  vars
[05:07:53] <Cork> but yes if you want to pass the index as "index" over the ajax call
[05:08:22] <Cork> sure set data: { index: $(this).closet('tr').data('index') }
[05:08:37] <Cork> or what ever else you want to do with it
[05:10:34] <baako> Cork: http://pastebin.com/7Y41vmmT
[05:10:51] <Cork> ...
[05:10:57] <rabbitear> hi Cork
[05:10:57] <Cork> no that won't work
[05:11:15] <Cork> baako: you know the basics of jquery right?
[05:11:22] <Cork> or js for that matter
[05:11:28] <baako> Cork: yes
[05:11:46] <Cork> then you should understand what the code i gave you do
[05:11:52] <Cork> and what you should replace
[05:12:00] <rabbitear> yeah, evenually people start speaking piglatin
[05:18:58] <ducklobster> is it possible to use the jQuery selector on an existing jQuery object?
[05:19:30] <ducklobster> such as https://gist.github.com/anonymous/d3c1c6e9d82a229214de
[05:20:03] <_rgn> ducklobster: it's called find()
[05:20:27] <ducklobster> so the selector is used for dealing directly with the DOM only
[05:20:37] <ducklobster> $()
[05:21:10] <_rgn> correct
[05:21:29] <_rgn> well, by selector you mean the $ function
[05:21:44] <_rgn> technically a selector is a string
[05:21:55] <_rgn> like 'tr#current'
[05:22:09] <Cork> ducklobster: just do current.find('#name')
[05:22:12] <Cork> not $
[05:22:19] <ducklobster> great, thanks guys
[05:22:24] <Cork> though that said, as what your looking for is an id
[05:22:34] <Cork> there is no need using anything other then  $() there
[05:22:48] <Cork> (the id has to be page globally unique anyway)
[05:23:09] <Cork> ducklobster: also don't prefix ids with element names
[05:23:18] <Cork> you are slowing down the selector for no good reason
[05:23:21] <ducklobster> Cork: right, as they should be unique
[05:23:26] <ducklobster> what about if I have something like
[05:23:34] <ducklobster> var el = $(myTemplate);
[05:23:43] <ducklobster> el.appendTo("#someid");
[05:23:54] <ducklobster> would it be proper to use the .find() there?
[05:24:03] <Cork> en the el; sure
[05:24:13] <Cork> then it would make perfect sense
[05:24:20] <Cork> as you can't target those elements without it
[05:24:26] <Cork> (as it isn't inside the document)
[05:24:55] <Cork> ducklobster: for clarity $('selector') is a shorthand for $(document).find('selector')
[05:25:08] <ducklobster> ahh I see
[05:26:03] <ducklobster> awesome, thanks for the help!
[05:29:52] <JustMozzy> hey everyone. is it possible to get an elements selector?
[05:30:51] <xec> JustMozzy: a lot of different selectors could match an element, so, what exactly do you mean?
[05:31:43] <xec> you can get the tagName of a DOM node?
[05:33:21] <JustMozzy> xec: hmm... actually you are right. I have to build a selector from the current element then. found something nice http://davecardwell.co.uk/javascript/jquery/plugins/jquery-getpath/jquery-getpath.js
[05:33:57] <Cork> JustMozzy: those libs basically always creates way over complex selectors (and they can't really do anything else)
[05:34:56] <xec> multiple elements can have the same path too
[05:35:08] <xec> JustMozzy: what do you want it for?
[05:35:14] <Cork> well not if it uses :nth-child and the like
[05:35:25] <Cork> and they normally do
[05:36:13] <xec> Cork: well it doesn't look like it, the source for that one is pretty short - it seems to account for ID and Class but thats about it
[05:36:26] <Cork> ah
[05:36:31] <xec> the rest is just chaining >'s
[05:36:35] <Cork> ya, then it won't work for generic elements
[05:36:51] <JustMozzy> xec: I am trying to find elements that have their color property with important! and build a specific selector so I can override it
[05:36:58] <JustMozzy> just playing around in other words
[05:37:16] <xec> playing around is the best way to learn :)
[05:37:17] <Cork> JustMozzy: you can't ever override !important
[05:37:21] <Cork> ever
[05:37:32] <JustMozzy> Cork: Yes you can
[05:37:34] <Cork> well except you define an important value before them
[05:37:37] <xec> sure you can, put !important on an inline style :D
[05:37:46] <Cork> inline doesn't support !important
[05:37:53] <JustMozzy> All you need is a selector with higher precedence
[05:37:59] <Cork> no
[05:38:04] <JustMozzy> yes
[05:38:07] <Cork> the order of definition has a change
[05:38:21] <Cork> but how specific the selector is doesn't matter
[05:38:28] <Cork> or at least it shouldn't according to specs
[05:38:32] <xec> two rules with !important takes specificity into account
[05:38:45] <xec> as if neither had
[05:38:57] <Cork> you sure?
[05:38:59] <JustMozzy> http://jsfiddle.net/mem5zv33/2/
[05:38:59] <xec> (but of course ignoring all matching ones without)
[05:39:02] <xec> pretty sure
[05:39:14] <JustMozzy> The fiddle shows it is true :)
[05:40:06] <xec> also
[05:40:10] <xec> inline styles ftw http://jsfiddle.net/mem5zv33/3/
[05:40:11] <JustMozzy> http://css-tricks.com/specifics-on-css-specificity/
[05:40:17] <xec> good luck overriding that one :D
[05:40:34] <JustMozzy> xec: inline is mean.
[05:40:53] <Cork> "Author and user style sheets may contain !important declarations, with user !important declarations overriding author !important declarations."
[05:41:00] <Cork> the specs says the complete oposite
[05:41:23] <Cork> where order of the rule loading is what matters
[05:41:28] <Cork> not how specific they are
[05:41:55] <Cork> http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css-cascade/#importance
[05:41:59] <xec> user declarations = rules set in browser options?
[05:42:12] <Cork> user agent == browser
[05:42:21] <Cork> user == user overiding the browser
[05:42:27] <Cork> author == page
[05:42:35] <xec> so how does a user override the browser
[05:42:48] <Cork> if the browser sets !important; you can't
[05:42:58] <Cork> the property is locked by the browser
[05:43:17] <xec> in any case, in this case (the demo) all rules are author declaration
[05:43:22] <xec> s
[05:43:27] <Cork> well tecnically you can with an extension inject a rule before the ua stylesheet and there by win
[05:43:28] <xec> lol
[05:43:36] <Cork> at least in firefox
[05:43:39] <xec> in any case in this case, slightly confusing
[05:43:45] <Cork> i don't think you have power enough to do that in chrome
[05:45:07] <JustMozzy> another question I could not find a solution to (yet). can I read with jquery if a css property is marked as important?
[05:45:17] <xec> "user style sheet" in that spec text translates to custom style sheet set in the browser by a user, right?
[05:45:22] <Cork> JustMozzy: no
[05:45:30] <Cork> xec: yes
[05:45:43] <Cork> JustMozzy: you would have to traverse the stylesheets
[05:45:54] <JustMozzy> Cork: oki, thanks :)
[05:46:00] <Cork> JustMozzy: jquery normally just work with inline style and computed style
[05:46:10] <Cork> and none of those has a hierarchy
[05:46:15] <Cork> only active value
[05:46:52] <Cork> JustMozzy: there is a plugin for jquery that does this though
[05:47:24] <Cork> or you could use document.styleSheetSets manually
[05:48:07] <Cork> https://github.com/Spreadsheets/jQuery.sheet
[06:08:05] <Jker> someone here is a programmer ?
[06:10:15] <Tairesh> lol

[06:33:20] <viktorlund> Hi I'm a kind of stuck here and I was hoping someone could point me in the right direction
[06:33:24] <viktorlund> http://screencast.com/t/ECHvfG4UBqn
[06:33:44] <viktorlund> How is it possible that this function get's fired if the event isn't namespaced?
[06:34:02] <viktorlund> It's being fired by a normal click event coming seemingly to me from a place where it should not fire.
[06:34:26] <BillCriswell> ghost clicks.
[06:34:38] <BillCriswell> paranormal interactivity
[06:34:55] <viktorlund> hehehe
[06:35:16] <bbclover> hey guys, just wanting to try something in the console... I went to set the height property of this div to match the bottom of this other dom element. both have unique id's. How would I do this in the console to see if it works?
[06:35:28] <bbclover> liek match the height of the other div I guess
[06:35:33] <viktorlund> I just can't understand from the docs that this should even be possible.
[06:35:40] <bbclover> well not quite. Just the bottom where it is
[06:35:59] <BillCriswell> bbclover: $('#a').height($('#b').height()); ?
[06:36:35] <bbclover> do I not have to use scrolltop or something?
[06:37:00] <BillCriswell> bbclover: I might not be understanding you fully.
[06:37:17] <BillCriswell> Oh the elemenets don't have the same top starting point?
[06:37:21] <bbclover> yeah
[06:37:26] <BillCriswell> Ah,..
[06:37:27] <cjohnson> bbclover: use whatever value it is that you want to set the other element to
[06:37:58] <BillCriswell> bbclover: You can use $('#a').offset().top to get that.
[06:38:25] <bbclover> so $('#a').height(that);?
[06:38:44] <cjohnson> #somethingotherthana
[06:38:46] <BillCriswell> You'd have to add the height as well.
[06:38:53] <cjohnson> but yes... that is how you set the height in jquery
[06:38:59] <BillCriswell> if b has height.
[06:39:42] <xec> viktorlund: any click on the element will trigger the event, regardless of namespace, if that's what you mean http://jsfiddle.net/2yvnjnge/1/
[06:40:55] <BillCriswell> bbclover: http://jsbin.com/pivegatari/1/edit?html,css,js,output like this?
[06:41:01] <viktorlund> xec: okay, so namespacing is only so that I can use them with .off ?
[06:41:24] <BillCriswell> Er, http://jsbin.com/pivegatari/2/edit?css,js,output
[06:41:35] <cjohnson> or you could use an if check to only run code on that namespace viktorlund
[06:41:42] <cjohnson> or you could .trigger() only the namedspaced event
[06:41:44] <cjohnson> lots of uses
[06:43:29] <viktorlund> okay, it's used inside of a library so I cannot really change there.
[06:43:38] <viktorlund> Thanks a lot though, I couldn't figure that out with the docs.
[06:44:18] <viktorlund> I understood that any namespace would trigger if i had click.x.y , just didn't realize that click would trigger all.
[06:45:39] <cjohnson> it's like css
[06:45:43] <cjohnson> if it matches one, it fires
[06:45:51] <cjohnson> click.x or click.y would fire that event
[06:45:59] <cjohnson> you're right the docs are rather short
[06:46:06] <cjohnson> http://api.jquery.com/event.namespace/ particularly could use some help
[06:46:12] <cjohnson> the .on() page has a little more info
[07:17:17] <th3fallen> Stupid question for you guys what is this saying 				storage.setItem(cacheKey + 'cachettl', +new Date() + 1000 * 60 * hourstl);
[07:17:25] <th3fallen> Specifically the +new Date
[07:17:37] <th3fallen> Never seena plus before a new keyword
[07:17:53] <cjohnson> + forces it to be a number
[07:18:07] <cjohnson> which with a Date object I think returns .getTime()
[07:18:08] <th3fallen> Ah, well thats neat thanks cjohnson
[07:18:18] <th3fallen> What about the + 1000 * 60
[07:18:26] <cjohnson> well that's adding 1000 * 60 ;)
[07:18:26] <th3fallen> Is that just converting hourstl to hours? Orr?
[07:18:52] <cjohnson> yeah I think the Date returns a timestamp in microseconds
[07:19:07] <cjohnson> so 1000 * 60 * hourstl  is adding however many hours in hourstl to the value
[07:19:22] <cjohnson> 1000 microseconds times 60 minutes times however many hours
[07:19:36] <th3fallen> So if i wanted hourstl to be minutes i would remove the * 60?
[07:19:42] <cjohnson> exactly
[07:19:47] <th3fallen> And rename the var obviously
[07:19:50] <cjohnson> ;)
[07:20:06] <th3fallen> Gotcha, thanks for the quick anwsers to my stupid questions
[07:20:21] <cjohnson> not so stupid, I've seen worse
[07:20:32] <th3fallen> Heh, fair enough
[07:29:14] <kakashiAL> hey guys, I am using the datepicker of jquery UI, it is build in
[07:29:31] <kakashiAL> does jquery or jquery UI has a build in time picker?
[07:29:56] <deepy> http://jqueryui.com/datepicker/
[07:30:00] <deepy> jquery ui has a date picker
[07:30:12] <kakashiAL> I am talking about a time picker :)
[07:30:18] <kakashiAL> hours, minutes :)
[07:32:10] <deepy> oh, right
[07:32:26] <deepy> http://plugins.jquery.com/tag/timepicker/
[07:32:27] <deepy> :-)
[07:32:45] <kakashiAL> so there is nothing buildin?
[07:38:43] <bbclover> if I do $('html, body').css('overflow', ''); will this set the overflow property to default for both html and body??
[07:42:23] <bbclover> seems I have to set overflow to 'visible' readily
[07:42:46] <bbclover> readily, verily, truly
[07:45:37] <Erwat> hey is ||| valid in the name of a variable in html?
[07:45:48] <Erwat> as in a
[07:46:09] <Oka> Erwat: What?
[07:46:13] <Erwat> <div data-event|asd="blah"
[07:46:13] <dokma> I'm using clone to clone a form modify it, stringify it and POST. Since jQuery clone does not clone selected properties because it's too expensive my idea is to clone and then swap but I don't know how to swap the nodes?
[07:46:40] <dokma> so I do frm = $('#id').clone(true, true);
[07:47:01] <dokma> and now the frm contains the form with bad select values
[07:47:06] <Erwat> Oka: would something like that be valid tot ype because i noticed that netbeans' coloring stopped working after that
[07:47:22] <dokma> how do I swap frm and $('#id') ???
[07:49:25] <shoky> dokma: why not get an array with $('#id').serializeArray()  and modify that form, and POST it
[07:49:32] <shoky> modify that array, i mean
[07:49:45] <dokma> I need the HTML cause it ends up in an e-mail
[07:50:02] <shoky> what html
[07:50:07] <dokma> form HTML
[07:50:18] <dokma> in the end I use .val(JSON.stringify(estimate.html()));
[07:50:35] <dokma> and that HTML ends up in an e-mail to the client
[07:50:51] <shoky> ok, what does clone have to do with this?
[07:51:04] <baako> guys i try to passing in the value in data-index from my table(which is generated using records from my database. http://jsfiddle.net/pfc863ho/
[07:51:12] <baako> but i am not getting get value :(
[07:51:14] <dokma> I clone the form, modify it, stringify it and POST
[07:51:30] <dokma> but since :selected is not cloned it ends up wrong
[07:51:43] <dokma> so I either need to copy the :selected manually
[07:51:50] <dokma> or just swap the clone and the original
[07:52:07] <shoky> how would swapping help with the selected stuff?
[07:52:17] <dokma> well the original is correct
[07:52:37] <shoky> and then you swap it with something incorrect..?
[07:52:39] <dokma> so I would swap so that the displayed stuff does not get modified and submit the original
[07:52:59] <dokma> the incorrect stuff looks the same as the correct stuff
[07:53:11] <shoky> but it has incorrect stuff...
[07:53:34] <dokma> it's not important because it just sits for a second on the screen while the POST goes through
[07:53:46] <shoky> if it's not important, why do the swap at all?
[07:54:02] <dokma> because if the incorrect stuff goes into the POST then the e-mail is incorrect
[07:54:15] <shoky> and how would the swap make it not go into the post ?
[07:54:20] <dokma> I can live with incorrect stuff being in the DOM for a second
[07:54:41] <dokma> because if I swap the clone with the original then the original goes into the POST and the original is correct
[07:54:48] <shoky> wat
[07:55:13] <shoky> then i have no idea what you mean by swap
[07:55:15] <dokma> well like this: original == CORRECT, swap == LACKS CORRECT :selected
[07:55:23] <dokma> if original goes into POST all fine
[07:55:29] <dokma> right now I have this:
[07:55:37] <dokma> #1 clone original
[07:55:43] <dokma> #2 modify clone
[07:55:47] <dokma> #3 post clone
[07:55:52] <dokma> I want:
[07:55:57] <dokma> #1 clone original
[07:56:20] <dokma> #2 swap clone and original so that clone is only on the screen while the POST goes through
[07:56:27] <dokma> #3 modify original and POST it
[07:56:38] <baako> please can someone help http://jsfiddle.net/pfc863ho/2/
[07:56:55] <dokma> but it's way to much explanation anyway
[07:57:01] <baako> why isn't the value working
[07:57:04] <shoky> dokma: then why clone it at all.. if you're gonna post the original?
[07:57:32] <dokma> shoky, because I modify the form and if it's visible it would look like something strange is happening
[07:57:58] <dokma> so how do I swap a node in a variable and a visible node?
[08:00:26] <shoky> there's .replaceWith
[08:00:48] <shoky> not really a swap
[08:02:13] <shoky> but anyway you can post it via ajax and not have anything in the DOM change at all
[08:02:15] <dokma> shoky, I'm trying that right now
[08:02:41] <dokma> shoky, that's what I'm doing but the clone method gives me the incorrect copy
[08:02:46] <dokma> thus the swap
[08:02:50] <shoky> don't use clone
[08:03:09] <dokma> is there something that copies the :selected as well?
[08:03:13] <shoky> use .serializeArray and .html() and modify the array
[08:03:15] <shoky> no
[08:03:39] <shoky> .serializeArray copies the selected, yes. but .html doesn't
[08:04:25] <dokma> serializeArray does nothing for me here
[08:04:30] <dokma> I need the full HTML
[08:06:35] <cjohnson> outerHTML
[08:06:40] <cjohnson> ?
[08:06:51] <baako> fuck all of you
[08:07:04] <BillCriswell> lol
[08:07:15] <shoky> dokma: "selected" is a runtime property in the live DOM, not an html attribute
[08:07:23] <baako> sorry that was my dog
[08:08:17] <cjohnson> I see the problem with your code baako
[08:09:19] <baako> cjohnson: what is it please
[08:09:29] <cjohnson> your face
[08:10:24] <baako> cjohnson: i see
[08:14:00] <dokma> shoky, I know, but I'm using it in the transformations so it ends up in the HTML
[08:14:07] <dokma> "ends up"
[08:14:43] <treeprogram> I am using code that looks like this to submit a form to both a PHP file and Google spreadsheets:  http://pastebin.com/aainZbP3  The problem is that the submit to the PHP file is inconsistent. Sometimes it won't create a database entry (the PHP file enters the form data to a database) even while the data is added to the Google Spreadsheet. Is this because of the Javascript? If so, is there better jQuery code I can use to get the 
[08:15:09] <Absolute0> $('input[name*=date_picked_up_on_medicare]') gives me two elements but $('input[name*=date_picked_up_on_medicare][value!=""]') gives me none.
[08:15:14] <Absolute0> Does value!="" work?
[08:15:19] <cjohnson> it should
[08:16:22] <Absolute0> .filter(function(i, e) { return e.value; }); works however
[08:17:42] <abailarri> Hello. I need to change a sql row of my database when a user logouts of my web. Works well. I launch an ajax function when I click on Exit button. But when the browser is closed, how is possible triger some function?
[08:18:37] <cjohnson> Absolute0: try the first selector and console.log the value. also try .value.length maybe. could be a hidden char?
[08:19:16] <Absolute0> empty list
[08:20:18] <cjohnson> I thought you said it gave you 2 elements?
[08:20:46] <cjohnson> onbeforeunload abailarri
[08:20:56] <cjohnson> however the request isn't guaranteed to complete
[08:20:58] <lilsammy> Anyone know how to pass 2 values  by time per day to a highchart?
[08:21:06] <Absolute0> $('input[name*=date_picked_up_on_medicare]').length
[08:21:08] <Absolute0> 2
[08:21:17] <Absolute0> $('input[name*=date_picked_up_on_medicare][value!=""]').length
[08:21:18] <Absolute0> 0
[08:21:26] <cjohnson> Navigator.sendBeacon is used to send small snippets of data to a server before the page unloads...but it's only just been added to firefox developer version
[08:21:37] <cjohnson> Absolute0: right. so check the values of those elements
[08:21:45] <cjohnson> log the values, log their lengths
[08:21:57] <cjohnson> I would bet there are hidden characters or the value is soemthing other than what you expect
[08:21:58] <Absolute0> value="" is blank
[08:22:05] <Absolute0> but the in memory values are set by the user...
[08:22:24] <cjohnson> ok then value isn't blank
[08:22:32] <Absolute0> it is in the html
[08:22:36] <Absolute0> but not in the updated html
[08:22:37] <cjohnson> but not in the DOM
[08:22:42] <cjohnson> which is where the selector is looking
[08:22:45] <Absolute0> oh..
[08:23:05] <cjohnson> if you add a class to an element and then do $('.class') it will pick up that element, etc

[08:29:26] <cjohnson> _overflow_: in the code where you call the .show(), console.log(jQuery.ui);
[08:29:35] <cjohnson> and see what it prints to your console
[08:29:45] <cjohnson> abailarri: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/navigator.sendBeacon
[08:30:08] <cjohnson> looks like the very latest chrome supports it too, cool. still, you can't rely on this yet
[08:30:26] <cjohnson> there's no other options for sending ajax requests when the page is unloading that work reliably abailarri
[08:30:29] <DevAntoine> hi
[08:31:02] <abailarri> cjohnson, and how do another pages? For example when I close the browser close the session
[08:31:12] <DevAntoine> I've got lot of input states/values which depend on other (multiple) inputs/selects values. How can I do that?
[08:31:35] <cjohnson> abailarri: hrm? what is your question?
[08:31:48] <cjohnson> DevAntoine: "depend on" meaning what
[08:32:04] <abailarri> cjohnson, simplye I want to change a status from 1 to 0 (in the DB) when the browser is closed
[08:32:39] <mbrzuzy> DevAntoine, maybe http://knockoutjs.com/ can be a good solution for you.  But it depends on how complex your functionality is
[08:32:41] <cjohnson> abailarri: there is no reliable way to do that yet
[08:32:51] <cjohnson> you would have to find another solution
[08:33:03] <cjohnson> ie timeouts
[08:33:04] <DevAntoine> cjohnson: if field A & B have a value, then field c's value is calculated with these two values. If select's option 'foo' is selected and 'bar' is selected too from another select, then disable field Z, etc.
[08:33:18] <_overflow_> cjohnson:  Object { version="1.9.2", keyCode={...}, ie=false, more...}
[08:33:28] <cjohnson> DevAntoine: you would probably have to hand-craft this logic
[08:33:48] <cjohnson> _overflow_: how do you know it's not using the jquery ui show?
[08:34:04] <treeprogram> $1 in bitcoin to anyone who can give me a suggestion on this: I am using code that looks like this to submit a form to both a PHP file and Google spreadsheets:  http://pastebin.com/aainZbP3  The problem is that the submit to the PHP file is inconsistent. Sometimes it won't create a database entry (the PHP file enters the form data to a database) even while the data is added to the Google Spreadsheet, meaning the PHP file is not b
[08:34:04] <DevAntoine> mbrzuzy: what's killing me is that I've already a lot of jQuery code. It's more than 300 lines of almost unmaintable code :/
[08:34:04] <abailarri> cjohnson, and existe a way to detect if there are activity in the page and If there is not, trigger some event?
[08:34:17] <treeprogram> Is this because of the Javascript? If so, is there better jQuery code I can use to get the same effect more reliably?
[08:34:19] <_overflow_> cjohnson: because if a use parameters from jquery.ui API the show doesn't work
[08:34:22] <cjohnson> DevAntoine: I would use data attributes to specify the relationships to make it flexible
[08:34:50] <DevAntoine> cjohnson: I'm not sure to see how it works (I know what data attributes are though)
[08:34:53] <mbrzuzy> DevAntoine do you want to keep what you have already?
[08:34:58] <cjohnson> you can't submit the same form to two places treeprogram
[08:34:59] <cjohnson> use ajax
[08:35:20] <cjohnson> abailarri: just use a timeout
[08:35:31] <mbrzuzy> There other similar javascript librarys like knockout.js that in a sense give you reactive functionality to your front-end
[08:35:35] <cjohnson> abailarri: every time the user performs an action, save their "last active" time in the DB
[08:35:43] <mbrzuzy> React.js might be another
[08:35:43] <cjohnson> and then 60 seconds after their last active time, time them out
[08:35:57] <cjohnson> I don't really think that is what he needs mbrzuzy
[08:36:02] <abailarri> yes I do this cjohnson
[08:36:04] <abailarri> thanks
[08:36:05] <mbrzuzy> maybe i'm misunderstanding
[08:36:06] <treeprogram> cjohnson, could you elaborate? First of all, it is successfully submitting to two places on most form submits. Second, are you saying ajax would let me submit the form to two places, or would ajax allow for an alternate path to submitting the form data?
[08:36:24] <cjohnson> if it's working, it's accidental
[08:36:31] <cjohnson> a form once submitted will load the new page
[08:36:36] <cjohnson> don't rely on that
[08:36:44] <cjohnson> you would just make 2 ajax requests with POST method
[08:36:49] <treeprogram> cjohnson: do you have a bitcoin address I can send the $1 in BTC to?
[08:37:07] <cjohnson> treeprogram: I'm fine, thanks though :)
[08:37:23] <_overflow_> cjohnson: example .show('scale') should work for jqueryUI.show() function  but not for jquery.show()
[08:37:23] <DevAntoine> mbrzuzy: well, I've used angular for 6 months, but at first I thought it was faster to do it in pure jQuery, considering I only have one page
[08:37:36] <cjohnson> take a look at $form.serialize() though treeprogram to be able to read all the form's data into an array for use with ajax requests
[08:38:02] <mbrzuzy> ah damn, and you ended up with 300 lines?
[08:38:16] <Omar-> jquery widget factory question
[08:38:30] <Omar-> I have made a custom event using widget factory
[08:38:49] <Omar-> when I attach the event to document, it doesn't seem to work
[08:39:08] <Omar-> this._trigger("bottomreached", event, { target: this.element });
[08:39:26] <Omar-> $(document).on("bottomreached", function(e) { /* code */ });
[08:40:15] <DevAntoine> mbrzuzy: yep. As clean as I can do, but I already now it'll be a mess to maintain
[08:40:22] <Omar-> http://jsbin.com/pomeze/1/edit?html,output
[08:40:39] <Omar-> the event should trigger when page's bottom is reached
[08:41:04] <DevAntoine> but I know now I should use something like angular, but I'm fearing it's already too late and it'll double my dev time
[08:41:13] <gurke_> hi@all :)
[08:42:53] <mbrzuzy> DevAntoine, if you arleady know a bit of angular then it might be worth the extra dev time needed to port your existing code over
[08:45:11] <DevAntoine> mbrzuzy: thing is, I have no models, my code is only interacting with the UI
[08:45:36] <mbrzuzy> There should be frameworks that handle that kind of stuff
[08:45:43] <mbrzuzy> knockout might be one actually
[08:47:29] <DevAntoine> mbrzuzy: ok, thanks for the clues
[08:52:57] <treeprogram> cjohnson: I'm reluctant to rebuild the submit functions, because it took me a long time get the current submit method working as is. Before I jump into this task, do you have any idea why the dual submit currently works 80% of the time? Why would it work in the majority of cases, but not all? Is it browser-specific do you think?
[08:53:19] <cjohnson> it's just absolutely not the intended behavior of forms
[08:53:22] <cjohnson> if it works, it's by accident
[08:56:37] <treeprogram> cjohnson: ok, so then it's probably just some browsers that it works accidentally with, because every time I test it with my Chrome it works, but it will occasionally fail for my users. I guess I could grab their browser and record that information too, to verify whether that's the problem, but it's probably better for me to just rebuild it, since it will continue being a problem
[08:58:02] <cjohnson> yeah, just fix it. use 2 ajax submits
[08:58:07] <cjohnson> it should be fairly trivial
[09:04:16] <shoky> Omar-: i see you got it working? or do you still need help
[09:15:34] <Omar-> hi shoky sorry I was AFK
[09:16:29] <Omar-> shoky yes got it working, I forgot to add widgetname before "page" before custom event "bottomreach".
[09:26:38] <JaredCE> i have an ajax call that returns html, how do i query that html for an element?
[09:26:48] <cjohnson> $(theHtml).find('element')
[09:27:04] <robertmaxrees> .done(function(data){ $(data).find('.someClass'); });
[09:27:47] <JaredCE> ahhh
[09:28:49] <Omar-> which is faster $(data).find(".class") or $(".class", data) ?
[09:28:56] <robertmaxrees> they're the same.
[09:29:01] <robertmaxrees> the second one maps to the first.
[09:29:44] <Omar-> robertmaxrees what does "maps" mean?
[09:30:06] <robertmaxrees> i mean that $('.class', data); calls $(data).find(".class"); under the hood.
[09:30:15] <Omar-> oh ok
[09:30:27] <Omar-> so .find is faster I assume
[09:30:34] <robertmaxrees> not in any meaninfgul way.
[09:30:46] <robertmaxrees> the performance difference is more than negligible.
[09:31:21] <Omar-> I know that .hasClass is faster than .is
[09:31:35] <sacho> stop microoptimizing.
[09:31:42] <robertmaxrees> ^
[09:32:01] <Omar-> i once tested it on jspref
[09:32:18] <hexsprite> trying to implement parent selector with jquery.  I want to select .row elements that have a td.active child.  Should apply a class to these .row elements when the td becomes .active
[09:32:26] <hexsprite> How can I do that with jquery?
[09:32:47] <robertmaxrees> hexsprite check out contains
[09:33:29] <robertmaxrees> Omar- there's a performance difference between the two, sure, but 9 times out of 10, you're not going to notice it.
[09:33:55] <robertmaxrees> hexsprite there's http://api.jquery.com/jquery.contains/ and http://api.jquery.com/contains-selector/ - pick your poiston :)
[09:33:59] <robertmaxrees> *poison
[09:35:16] <Omar-> robertmaxrees true, but it matters when it comes to mobile development. pls correct me if I'm wrong
[09:35:55] <robertmaxrees> i'd wager that the difference is still minimal enough to not really be meaningful.
[09:36:18] <Omar-> robertmaxrees noted, thanks ;)
[09:37:25] <robertmaxrees> the 3rd comment down on this answer sums up my feelings about coding to microoptimizations: http://stackoverflow.com/a/1789952/923919
[09:39:29] <Omar-> robertmaxrees lol
[09:39:33] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[09:39:33] <hexsprite> robertmaxrees: thanks.  looks like :has() works better in this case for me... eg.  .row:has(td.active)
[09:40:03] <robertmaxrees> hexsprite there's also a .has()
[09:40:16] <Omar-> sacho I just understood what microoptimizing means
[09:40:17] <Omar-> ;)
[09:47:34] <javascript840> can anyone help with how to load a CSV file into this library? http://almende.github.io/chap-links-library/js/graph/doc/#Loading
[10:58:02] <jeffmjack> Could somebody tell me if something about this switch looks fishy?  It keeps returning the first case, even when it shouldn't. http://jsfiddle.net/k2eL96L6/
[10:58:25] <Fishy> jeffmjack: i can confirm it does look fishy... i would know
[10:58:32] <robertmaxrees> hahahahaha
[10:58:50] <robertmaxrees> jeffmjack could you flesh out the markup and stuff a bit?
[10:58:59] <jeffmjack> Fishy: LOL
[10:59:06] <jeffmjack> ok robertmaxrees
[11:01:42] <bbclover> Hey guys, if ($('#userGuideDialog_mask').height() > pos && pos > $('#viewerTable').height()) do I need parenthesis around each condition?
[11:02:06] <robertmaxrees> you shouldn't need them, but it'd be a lot easier to read.
[11:02:32] <bbclover> ok
[11:05:47] <jeffmjack> dammit now the example works :(
[11:05:55] <deepy> That sounds like a terrible issue
[11:12:05] <Oka> jeff, you still need help with the switch?
[11:12:13] <Oka> jeffmjack *
[11:16:07] <jeffmjack> Oka: yes although it seems to be working in the example
[11:17:39] <jeffmjack> for some reason very similar code keeps returning the first case, even when the score is not in that range
[11:19:09] <Oka> jeffmjack: Needs to be like `case (11<=score && score<20):`
[11:21:01] <jeffmjack> Oka: thanks but it seems that the formatting (11<=score<20) also work
[11:21:02] <jeffmjack> s
[11:21:25] <jeffmjack> I think I just figured it out, it was a problem with scope and passing variables
[11:21:27] <Oka> 11<=score<20 computes 11<= to a boolean, and then compares that against 20
[11:22:15] <buzzedword> hey guys. i feel like im missing something really simple here, but i have a form with a bunch of hidden inputs i'm generating on the server as an array
[11:22:20] <Oka> 11<=6<20 will compute to true
[11:22:47] <buzzedword> when i $.fn.serializeArray, i'm getting the form field as its "object[key]" instead of as an array.
[11:23:14] <jeffmjack> Oka: oh no kidding?? crazy... thanks for the heads up
[11:23:41] <buzzedword> does that sounds correct to anyone, or is this actually not behaving how i want it to be?
[11:24:11] <cjohnson> buzzedword: for example?
[11:24:13] <robertmaxrees> buzzedword that doesn't sound right to me
[11:24:56] <buzzedword> robertmaxrees: right? an input with the name of "model[key]" should break down to name: "model", value: { key:.... }?
[11:25:16] <robertmaxrees> buzzedword right - http://api.jquery.com/serializearray/
[11:25:17] <bbclover> should I always use .on for events? Is it noticeably faster? Is $(window).on('resize', d(p)); correct syntax if I want to call some function d and pass object p?
[11:25:33] <robertmaxrees> bbclover .on() is sort of the preferred method for all event binding.
[11:25:41] <robertmaxrees> that's not how you'd pass extra data to the event handler, though.
[11:25:51] <cjohnson> no... that's not right I don't believe. it uses the name as the key, even if your name contains square braces
[11:26:09] <bbclover> robertmaxrees was that to me?
[11:26:17] <bbclover> I just want to acll this function that takes a parameter on resize
[11:26:19] <robertmaxrees> bbclover yes.
[11:26:27] <cjohnson> your definition currently calls d at the time of binding
[11:26:30] <robertmaxrees> that's not how you pass extra args.
[11:26:39] <bbclover> it's not an extra arg
[11:26:44] <bbclover> it's just a function d with this parameter p
[11:26:53] <robertmaxrees> yes it is ;)
[11:27:05] <cjohnson> if d returns the function you want to be fired when the resize event fires, then what you have is right
[11:27:07] <robertmaxrees> $(window).on('resize', d(p)); will reun d(p) and use whatever that returns as the event handler.
[11:27:52] <buzzedword> robertmaxrees: take a look at this: https://gist.github.com/buzzedword/928e2efad955548185fe
[11:28:02] <buzzedword> dont worry about the parsed.js, thats serverside things
[11:28:14] <bbclover> oh yes
[11:28:18] <bbclover> my d(p) returns something
[11:28:23] <buzzedword> but that's the format of my HTML-- it doesn't break down into the nested object
[11:28:26] <bbclover> there is a return in there
[11:28:30] <robertmaxrees> bbclover does that return the function you want to use as the handler?
[11:28:32] <cjohnson> buzzedword: what your backend does with the names is up to the backend but in the frontend a name="a[][][][]" is still just a flat value http://jsfiddle.net/7xdp308h/
[11:28:43] <cjohnson> bbclover: does it return a function?
[11:29:23] <buzzedword> cjwelborn: THANK you. okay, so i'm chasing a red herring
[11:29:35] <bbclover> yeah
[11:29:47] <robertmaxrees> buzzedword for a more "complete" example: http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/75dk721r/
[11:30:17] <buzzedword> robertmaxrees: yeah, that's what i've been seeing. was unsure if that was expected or not after serializing
[11:30:37] <robertmaxrees> buzzedword yeah, it's an array of objects, each with "name" and "value" props
[11:30:44] <robertmaxrees> bbclover if that're returning the function you want to use as the handler, then your syntax is correc.t
[11:31:06] <buzzedword> okay, so then with that being said, is there a good way to break that down into an object? otherwise i'm writing a parser for it
[11:31:30] <buzzedword> my end goal is to send up all my form data as json, so i need to group that field
[11:31:33] <cjohnson> does your backend not do that? you'll probably have to write a quick parser if you need it in the frontend
[11:31:43] <cjohnson> should be fairly simple though
[11:31:51] <robertmaxrees> buzzedword you'll want to do that in your backend OR write your own serializer.
[11:31:57] <buzzedword> cjohnson: interestingly, express 4 is making that incredibly difficult
[11:32:26] <cjohnson> if you intend it to go as JSON you'll probably be better off serializing in the frontend I imagine
[11:32:47] <buzzedword> yeah-- because express only understands nested objects as json
[11:32:50] <buzzedword> so >_M
[11:33:11] <buzzedword> idk what that is, but it expresses my frustration pretty well right now lol
[11:33:12] <buzzedword> thank you guys
[11:33:16] <robertmaxrees> buzzedword i wouldn't do the serializeArray() just to transform the data a second time, but that's just me.
[11:33:58] <buzzedword> robertmaxrees: yeah, i'm not going to. i'm abandoning the urlencode transform and just sending it all up as json
[11:34:03] <robertmaxrees> good call.
[11:34:23] <buzzedword> so i need to parse on the frontend, because ...forget trying on the back. the middleware is broken black magic
[11:34:40] <robertmaxrees> just be careful how far you take that.
[11:34:48] <cjohnson> I always thought the way the urlencoded variables worked was messy anyway
[11:34:51] <cjohnson> its just ancient magic
[11:35:19] <buzzedword> robertmaxrees: no worries. this much i've done before. i prefer working with straight JSON anyway
[11:35:28] <buzzedword> its just the damn grouping thats annoying
[11:35:50] <buzzedword> thank you all
[12:20:45] <mikehaas763> Is .closest() the function I want to use if my current this context is a form element and I want to get the nested [type="submit"] button?
[12:20:57] <robertmaxrees> .closest() goes to parent elements.
[12:21:03] <robertmaxrees> you want .find() to go the other direction
[12:22:14] <Guest58067> what is the equi of javascript's 'document.querySelector('#main')'? I thought $('#main') would work. But it doesn't allow me to access properties of the #main element
[12:22:34] <robertmaxrees> what properties?
[12:22:40] <robertmaxrees> what, exactly, are you trying to do?
[12:26:58] <Guest58067> robertmaxrees: #main is a polymer-element. with javascript, i can do 'document.querySelector('#main').App.username. Where App is a js object with a username field
[12:27:35] <mikehaas763> .find() got me closer. Any idea why .first() like so: $(this).find('[type="submit"]').first() does not actually change was is selected? I still get an object with a property of '0' but I would expect the object assigned to the property of '0'
[12:27:58] <robertmaxrees> jquery wraps the dom elements, so you can't simply access like you would using jquery.  you need to .get(0) to get the underlying DOM node.
[12:28:45] <robertmaxrees> mikehaas763 huh?
[12:28:47] <robertmaxrees> losing me there.
[12:30:49] <robertmaxrees> mikehaas763 .first() reduces the set down to the first element in the list.
[12:31:01] <Guest58067> robertmaxrees: so i knew that jquery wraps elements. but i didn't know about get. thanks
[12:31:19] <mikehaas763> once minute I'm trying a couple things to make sure it's actually a problem I'm having lol
[12:31:34] <robertmaxrees> Guest58067 okay
[12:39:02] <mikehaas763> robertmaxrees, ah I see. I jquery must use getter properties or something else magical because when I was observing the value of that selector in my chrome debugger the actual element was assigned to a property with the name '0'. However, I see when I just try to access it directly I still get the element without needing to specify [0]
[12:39:08] <mikehaas763> Sorry if I've lost ya there lol
[12:39:43] <robertmaxrees> mikehaas763 something tells me you're convoluting stuff.
[12:39:49] <robertmaxrees> but whatever works haha
[12:40:30] <mikehaas763> robertmaxrees, doubtful. This is all I'm doing: var $submitButton = $(this).find('[type="submit"]').first();
[12:40:57] <robertmaxrees> the bit about "a property with the name '0'" is what makes me thing that.
[12:41:00] <robertmaxrees> *think that
[12:41:14] <mikehaas763> However, in the debugger when I set a breakpoint and look at the value of $submitButton, it shows an object with a property '0' that has the actual button dom element assigned to it
[12:41:21] <robertmaxrees> right.
[12:41:30] <robertmaxrees> because the jquery object is array-like.
[12:41:45] <robertmaxrees> so the element at "index 0" is the first one in the set.
[12:45:10] <mikehaas763> robertmaxrees, right. Ok so I guess I was just expecting that .first() would automatically give me the element in the array like object at 'index 0'. But like you said it actually just reduces the set down to the first element. I still have to access it at the 'index 0'
[12:45:35] <robertmaxrees> mikehaas763 right - any time youi'
[12:46:18] <robertmaxrees> *you're returning a jquery object, that's the issue.
[12:48:08] <robertmaxrees> you should check out .get() btw.
[12:48:24] <robertmaxrees> if you did .get(0) instead of .first(), you'd get the underlying dom node instead.
[12:55:20] <BillCriswell> mikehaas763: Seems like you want .eq(0) instead of .get(0).
[12:57:06] <mikehaas763> So I see what was going on now. I knew jquery wrapped native dom elements I just didn't know exactly how it was doing it... now I know

[13:15:12] <Rhlplrn> http://jsfiddle.net/zqsrqt0c/
[13:15:24] <Rhlplrn> some idea why the paging doesn't works
[13:15:26] <Rhlplrn> ?
[13:17:21] <Woet> Rhlplrn: you should start by actually loading the libraries you are using
[13:17:27] <Woet> jQuery itself for starters.
[13:18:20] <Rhlplrn> Woet : I don't understand what you say
[13:18:41] <Rhlplrn> start the jtable() function before all?
[13:18:47] <Laban> Hello!
[13:18:51] <Woet> Rhlplrn: no.
[13:19:00] <Woet> Rhlplrn: on jsfiddle, load the libraries you are using on the left.
[13:19:11] <Rhlplrn> ok
[13:19:30] <Rhlplrn> but anyway Im working with php, the data is bringing there
[13:19:43] <Rhlplrn> how can I to do works?
[13:19:57] <Woet> Rhlplrn: .. what?
[13:20:15] <Rhlplrn> the data is getting from php
[13:20:20] <Laban> In my response XML after using $.post, I want to loop over an XML tag. When searching around, everyone seems to use find(), but this find my tag all over the place. How can I just get it to match tags in the root?
[13:20:32] <Woet> Rhlplrn: so?
[13:20:48] <Woet> Laban: is there a reason you are using XML instead of JSON?
[13:21:00] <Rhlplrn> have you worked before with this plugin?
[13:21:13] <Woet> Rhlplrn: why is it relevant?
[13:21:14] <Rhlplrn> Ido all what say in the web page of autor but nothing
[13:21:22] <Laban> Woet: I don't want to change the code that generates the resultset.
[13:21:27] <Laban> Not now at least.
[13:21:31] <Rhlplrn> nothing, just by to know
[13:21:47] <Woet> Rhlplrn: again, load the libraries you are using on jsfiddle please.
[13:21:53] <Rhlplrn> ok
[13:25:15] <Laban> Woet: *sigh* xml->json was dead simple.... why didn't I think of that? :)
[13:25:32] <Woet> Laban: JSON is better in so many ways.
[13:25:48] <Laban> Yepp
[13:25:51] <Rhlplrn> http://jsfiddle.net/zqsrqt0c/1/
[13:25:52] <Rhlplrn> this
[13:26:40] <Woet> Rhlplrn: just "jquery.jtable.js" isn't gonna work, since jsfiddle does not host it. enter an external link there.
[13:26:53] <Woet> Rhlplrn: also, "SyntaxError: Unexpected token '}'. Expected ')' to end a argument list."
[13:46:56] <Rhlplrn> Woet : continue there?
[13:49:39] <Woet> Rhlplrn: .....?
[13:50:25] <z1haze> can anyone help me with isotope.js?
[13:52:05] <Woet> z1haze: if you ask an actual question, maybe
[13:52:58] <Rhlplrn> Now I see what happen is the paging toolbar is good because divide the total, the issue is with the visualization because show all
[13:52:59] <z1haze> Well, my tiles are loading in on top of each other sometimes, and the only fix I've found for is to run a resort after all of the isotope img has loaded
[13:53:57] <z1haze> http://hendricksweb.com/#portfolio
[13:55:51] <z1haze> what I would like to do is actually use the masonry layout from isotope, but this was included in this theme and I dont necessarily know how to do that
[13:55:59] <z1haze> but if i could ust fix the loading in issue that would be good enoug
[14:15:30] <z1haze> will anyone please help me figure out why my isotope items are loading in on top of each other?
[14:54:36] <Bogdaniel> hello can someone help me a little with a form and some ajax data ?
[14:54:58] <Bogdaniel> i'm trying to send some data and uploaded files using jquery
[14:58:50] <cjohnson> don't ask to ask just ask
[15:00:08] <Bogdaniel> I have this drag and drop upload file using ajax but I would like to send with the images a product id, which I have no idea how to do it because I already sending the data with the uploaded images
[16:08:28] <spookah> http://pastebin.com/7XLLDhGf <- SyntaxError: invalid property id -> 37832_52974pi_37832_52974 - is a field name as a number invalid?
[16:11:20] <robertmaxrees> spookah property names that start with numbers are a no-no unless it's an array.
[16:11:26] <robertmaxrees> or you wrap them in quotes.
[16:13:03] <spookah> robertmaxrees: single or double quotes?
[16:13:10] <robertmaxrees> depends.
[16:13:19] <robertmaxrees> singles will work fine in JS, doubles for JSON.
[16:14:23] <sammych> templating: I'm building HTML from user input. If I use <div> + userInput + </div>
[16:14:25] <sammych> oops
[16:14:38] <sammych> then that'll break if <> are used
[16:14:57] <sammych> I could change it to .text() to insert the values into the tags
[16:15:08] <sammych> but that kinda breaks the simplicity of templating
[16:15:35] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[16:15:45] <sammych> I'm using the Resig microtemplating
[16:16:30] <spookah> robertmaxrees: perfect, thank you!
[16:17:42] <sammych> $('#result').html('<div>' + '<blah> ' + '</div>'); // #result will be blank
[16:18:42] <robertmaxrees> $('#result').html('<div>' + blah + '</div>');, if blah is the user input
[16:18:59] <sammych> where blah === '<blah>'
[16:19:05] <robertmaxrees> that's not valid.
[16:19:11] <robertmaxrees> and that's just a tag.
[16:19:25] <sammych> duh. But the user types that into the form
[16:19:32] <robertmaxrees> ah i see what you're getting at.
[16:19:44] <sammych> do I escape it, because I don't want to use .text()
[16:19:52] <robertmaxrees> yes, you should escape it.
[16:19:55] <robertmaxrees> otherwise use text.
[16:20:02] <sammych> struggling to find the right google terms
[16:20:12] <sammych> blah.replace(/>/g, '&gt;').replace(/</g, '&lt;')
[16:20:20] <sammych> as super rudimentary
[16:20:44] <robertmaxrees> check out encodeURI() and encodeURIComponent()
[16:20:56] <sammych> wrong encoding (already tried)
[16:21:03] <robertmaxrees> kay
[16:21:11] <sammych> space = %20
[16:21:29] <robertmaxrees> you're validating this input server-side, right?
[16:21:57] <sammych> lets just ignore XSS issues for now
[16:22:04] <robertmaxrees> LMAO
[16:32:28] <sammych> Feature request: input sanitisation
[16:32:39] <sammych> hello, caja
[17:03:49] <tejas-manohar> hey with jquery how do i grab "patelbros.com" from http://www.yelp.com/biz/patel-brothers-nashville
[17:04:21] <tejas-manohar> "patelbros.com" is the url under the phone # which is under get directions under address and map
[17:04:43] <tejas-manohar> http://i.imgur.com/442ly4B.png
[17:04:55] <robertmaxrees> you mean while you're on that page?
[17:05:40] <Oka> O.o
[17:06:18] <robertmaxrees> $('.biz-website').find('a').text(); would work.
[17:08:33] <tejas-manohar> robertmaxrees: yeah
[17:08:49] <tejas-manohar> oh i didnt see .biz-website
[17:08:50] <tejas-manohar> ohhh
[17:16:02] <robertmaxrees> >.>
[17:33:53] <yazdmich> why is it that .trigger('mouseenter') only fires when i move my mouse inside the element? https://gist.github.com/yazdmich/a83e3f9f39baea115f0a#file-tooltip-js-L40
[17:34:19] <yazdmich> (the element in question is a thumbnail)
[18:16:51] <phoenixz> So I have this template, and  for some reason, some menu no longers open on a mouse click.. I thought I could find the problem by searching for #elementid, or .elementclass click events, but none were found.. Any idea how I could figure out what ought to cause the menu to show up when I click on a specific element?
[18:22:22] <Oka> phoenixz: Make a test case
[18:24:11] <phoenixz> Oka: Well, I've encountered this situation before, stripped the entire thign to the bares, and was left with just one large undocumented minified js library.. Turned out that one had bugs and wasn't functioning right.. I don't want to spend another 3 hours stripping it down to the bares just to find out the theme is shitty.. Is there a way I could actually find out  what event / code / css causes the menu to display when I click the mouse there?
[18:25:47] <phoenixz> I've checked in google chrome, I can find no event listeners for the elements I could click on, so then what?
[18:37:30] <BillCriswell> phoenixz: Any errors?
[18:38:22] <phoenixz> BillCriswell: None whatsoever.. If I had an error I would have a lead, but the problem is I have nothing.. So I suppose an events listener is missing or something.. I looked at the template, hey it worked! alright, what events are being listened to? none.. :'(
[18:38:50] <BillCriswell> phoenixz: How are you attaching your listeners?
[18:40:18] <phoenixz> BillCriswell: Thats part of the problem, its not mine.. This is some pre built template, and I've had this problem before with another one.. All I'd like to know is, how can I figure out where to look for the code that takes care of all this
[18:42:22] <BillCriswell> phoenixz: Look for a selector that matches something like the menu items.
[18:43:16] <phoenixz> BillCriswell: I think I finally narrowed it down to bootstrap.js with [data-toggle="dropdown"]
[19:08:17] <ducklobster> What is the proper way to tag a created element with some unique id?
[19:08:25] <ducklobster> I know that the actual id="" shouldn't be used
[19:08:41] <ducklobster> but would you append a bogus class to the element with some id info?
[19:41:44] <BillCriswell> ducklobster: All elements kind of technically have their own unique id already. I might not be understanding what you're asking though.
[20:29:38] <kinesis> is there a javascript/jquery event for when someone presses Ctrl + or - and changes the zoom? Masonry.js seems to freak out.
[20:39:34] <Xamper> Is there a way to allow the ripple emulator to run html files from your local file system?
[22:21:24] <_Avita> hello
[22:26:00] <washeul> hi every i am searching a function similar to jquery append function which will insert element at the same position but not at the end.
[22:27:02] <sacho> .before()
[22:27:44] <washeul> is this before fintion will create element one top of one another
[22:27:46] <sacho> http://api.jquery.com/category/manipulation/dom-insertion-inside/ http://api.jquery.com/category/manipulation/dom-insertion-outside/
[22:27:58] <sacho> the documentation is right there
[22:28:08] <kostodo> Is it possible to ‘disable’ a certain option in a select list?
[22:28:18] <kostodo> or worst case remove it completely
[22:28:53] <sacho> sure, set the disabled property
[22:28:59] <sacho> https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/API/HTMLOptionElement
[22:29:04] <kostodo> But that would disable the whole select box
[22:29:12] <kostodo> I want to disable just one of the items in the select list
[22:29:57] <sacho> no, it wouldn't
[22:30:10] <sacho> setting the disabled property on an option element wouldn't disable the select.
[22:35:18] <kostodo> Oh
[22:41:25] <washeul> let me enplane my question , i am creating a textbox dynamically and using append() to insert it in a div ,but the position is taking 1 after another , i want the text oxes position one top of another at the same position
[22:42:57] <washeul> what jquery function should i use to do that
[22:46:17] <kostodo> sacho: so how do you set that in jquery?
[22:47:26] <sacho> select the option element and use .prop() to set a property
[22:51:53] <kostodo> sacho: but how do I identify the exact option I want to disable?
[22:51:56] <kostodo> by its key?
[22:52:11] * sacho shrugs
[22:52:15] <sacho> by something you could identify it with
[22:52:22] <kostodo> all I got are keys
[22:52:42] <kostodo> How would I say, disable select list item with key = xyz
[22:53:45] <sacho> select the option with that key
[22:53:55] <kostodo> Yeah
[22:54:08] * sacho points at the many jquery selection functions available..
[22:54:22] <sacho> you could use an attribute selector, or you could select all the options and filter to the one you want, etc
[22:55:30] <kostodo> Got it mate thanks
[22:56:00] <Ayub> I have a query regarding jquery-form plugin uploading multipart data
[22:59:18] <Ayub> I am using http://malsup.com/jquery/form/#options-object plugin to upload file..response is being downloaded and none of the callback methods are invoked
[23:05:27] <Ayub> any clue on this pastebin ?
[23:05:28] <Ayub> http://pastebin.com/Q9i7SnyW
[23:22:08] <Cork> Ayub: and no errors/exceptions in the browser console?
[23:22:29] <Ayub> Cork: no exceptions
[23:22:49] <Cork> and the site is running from localhost?
[23:23:00] <Cork> (meaning not cross domain posting)
[23:23:07] <Ayub> Cork: yes, the response from server is being downloaded
[23:23:40] <Ayub> Cork: no its a cross domain, I mean the server I am invoking is also running locally on a different port
[23:24:01] <Cork> Ayub: that is cross domain
[23:24:13] <Cork> Ayub: different ports is considered cross domain
[23:24:16] <Ayub> Cork: yes you are right
[23:24:32] <Ayub> Cork: I meant its a cross domain request
[23:24:49] <Cork> is the post target supporting option requests?
[23:25:02] <Cork> (and configured to send cors headers with asked)
[23:25:17] <Ayub> Cork: how do I check that ?
[23:25:24] <Cork> the browser console
[23:25:31] <Cork> check for the option request
[23:25:40] <Ayub> ok..let me see it
[23:25:42] <Cork> and see if it gets the cors headers
[23:25:49] <Cork> ?mdn cors
[23:25:50] <b-ot> Cork: CORs - Mozilla Developer Network → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Access_control_CORS
[23:26:08] <Cork> Ayub: if not then you have why it doesn't work
[23:26:30] <Cork> Ayub: also note ie < 11 doesn't support cors
[23:27:00] <Ayub> Cork: ok..I am using IE 9
[23:27:07] <Cork> then you can't go this route
[23:27:21] <Cork> you would have to run both sites on the same port
[23:27:34] <Cork> you could do it by putting a proxy infront (like nginx)
[23:27:44] <Cork> and have the different servers in different paths behind the proxy
[23:27:54] <Ayub> also in the source page I have set the cors header <META HTTP-EQUIV="Access-Control-Allow-Origin" CONTENT="*">
[23:27:57] <Cork> but cross domain posts is impossible
[23:28:05] <Cork> Ayub: you can't set cors with meta
[23:28:12] <Ayub> ok..
[23:28:25] <Cork> for one, and it is the target server that needs it
[23:28:27] <Cork> not your site
[23:28:36] <Cork> meaning not the one where the html was loaded from
[23:28:44] <Ayub> Cork:ok..
[23:28:45] <Cork> and that is why meta can't be used
[23:29:54] <Ayub> Cork: the client application will be running on for example: http://myserver1/MyApp and the target is http://MyServer2/Service
[23:30:27] <Ayub> Cork: How can I make the file upload thing working ?
[23:30:53] <Cork> Ayub: if you need ie<11 you need to make myserver1 proxy the post server site to MyServer2
[23:31:05] <Cork> you can't do it from client side
[23:31:13] <Ayub> ok..
[23:31:16] <Cork> alternatively you can load the form from MyServer2
[23:31:46] <Ayub> Cork: ah ok..We have apache infront of MyServer2..
[23:31:53] <Cork> but you can't post from myserver1 to MyServer2, it just isn't an option
[23:32:54] <Ayub> Cork: ok..what config should I do on apache to make the file upload working if I load the form from MyServer1 ?
[23:33:26] <Cork> Ayub: MyServer1 or MyServer2?
[23:33:47] <Ayub> Cork:from MyServer1
[23:33:50] <Cork> Ayub: if you must post from myserver1 to myserver2 you can't support ie < 11
[23:34:11] <Cork> if you must support ie9 you MUST post from myserver2 to myserver2
[23:34:24] <Ayub> Cork: ok..
[23:34:40] <Ayub> Cork: how about the apache as proxy infront of myserver2 ?
[23:34:48] <Cork> apache isn't a proxy
[23:35:25] <Cork> Ayub: and you would have to setup a reverse proxy infront of both sites
[23:35:42] <Ayub> Cork: ok
[23:35:47] <Cork> so you make http://myserver3/myserver1 posts to http://myserver3/myserver2
[23:35:49] <Cork> for example
[23:36:04] <Cork> cause then it isn't cross domain
[23:36:06] <Ayub> ok
[23:36:31] <Cork> and the simplest solution for solving that (that i know and use) is with nginx
[23:36:49] <Ayub> Cork: ok..
[23:37:11] <Ayub> thak you for an indepth analysis..I would not have figured it out..
[23:37:30] <Cork> Ayub: correction
[23:37:43] <Ayub> Cork: just curious..why does my post requests succeed ?
[23:37:44] <Cork> there is apparently a module for apache that let it work as a reverse proxy
[23:38:15] <Cork> Ayub: you would have to have disabled cors in the browser for that to happen
[23:38:26] <Cork> and as far as i know only chrome support that
[23:38:37] <Ayub> Cork: ok
[23:38:50] <Cork> about the proxy module, never used it, but you could try it if you want
[23:39:03] <Cork> https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/mod_proxy.html
[23:39:15] <Ayub> Cork:ok..I have heard of it
[23:39:40] <Ayub> Cork: even though the request is cross domain..they suceed in invoking the server and getting back the response
[23:39:59] <Cork> Ayub: that shouldn't happen
[23:40:13] <Cork> ie < 11 would just block it
[23:40:38] <Cork> and cors complient browser would send an option request to the server and then block the post
[23:40:50] <Ayub> Cork:I have Ie 9 and its submitting the request and getting back the response
[23:41:20] <Ayub> Cork:response is being downloaded and it does not invoke any call back methods
[23:41:25] <Cork> all i can say is that a stock browser wouldn't support it
[23:41:52] <Ayub> ok
[23:42:09] <Cork> as this would be a security bug if they did
[23:42:32] <Ayub> Cork:security bug on the server application ?
[23:42:37] <Cork> in the browser
[23:42:43] <Ayub> ok
[23:42:49] <Cork> random sites has to be blocked from doing cross domain posts
[23:43:00] <Cork> or rather cross domain ajax posts
[23:43:06] <Ayub> Cork:Chrome is blocking but not IE9
[23:43:41] <Cork> Ayub: you might be using iframe posts in ie9
[23:43:45] <Cork> and then you could do the post
[23:43:54] <Cork> but the response would be cross domain so couldn't be accessed
[23:43:54] <Ayub> Cork: ok..thats the reason..
[23:44:23] <Ayub> Cork: the plugin I am using, creates and iframe and then posts the requests..however its not invoking the call back methods
[23:44:37] <Cork> not completely sure if cross domain form straight (none ajax) is blocked in ie9
[23:44:58] <Ayub> http://malsup.com/jquery/form/#file-upload
[23:45:02] <Cork> Ayub: yes cause it would be blocked from accessing the response cause of cors
[23:45:30] <Ayub> Cork: thats the plugin I am using for doing file upload with ajax
[23:47:25] <Cork> ya.. wow...
[23:47:39] <Cork> so you can do a post through iframes to trigger the server scripts
[23:47:45] <Cork> you just can't access the results
[23:47:57] <Cork> thought they would block that too...
[23:48:13] <Ayub> Cork: you are right..just can't access the results
[23:48:25] <Cork> ya, that is an absolute minimum
[23:48:37] <Ayub> ok..
[23:49:00] <Cork> else random sites could do a post to facebook, and get a login session
[23:49:06] <Cork> and remote doing what ever they like as you
[23:49:08] <Cork> (as an example)
[23:49:15] <Cork> so cors is important
[23:49:17] <Ayub> Cork: ok..
[23:50:06] <Ayub> Cork: thank you for educating me on this issue!!
[23:50:24] <Ayub> really valuable information!!
