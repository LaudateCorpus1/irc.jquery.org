[00:02:34] <dimi1947> the JS is wrong...it does not apply the class
[00:04:59] <Palmer11> addClass()
[00:05:30] <DietDrK> http://pastebin.com/YMUYjCc3 I'm trying to make it so the button gets all of the values in the form which are sibblings to the button which calls the function
[00:06:24] <DietDrK> right now it returns nothing to console
[00:07:56] <Palmer11> why would you stringify when you already created a local var?
[00:08:23] <Palmer11> it also seems like you are working backworks. Was this not working before?
[00:08:30] <DietDrK> right now it doesn't stringify anything since nothing is captured.
[00:08:41] <DietDrK> before it worked for exactly 1 form
[00:08:45] <DietDrK> Now I'm trying to expand it a bit.
[00:09:10] <Palmer11> well keep at it
[00:09:20] <Palmer11> I am sure you will discover the problem
[00:09:28] <DietDrK> I know what the problem is
[00:09:37] <DietDrK> It's not capturing anything, I'm not sure why it's not
[00:09:46] <DietDrK> it seems the button should have siblings, and they should be serializable into an array
[00:09:54] <DietDrK> and each of those elements in the array should be able to be mapped
[00:10:59] <Uhkis> how about not using inline js and using a click handler instead?
[00:11:37] <DietDrK> I was hoping to understand it
[00:13:05] <DietDrK> for <div> <input> <input> <button> </div> are the inputs not siblings() to the button?
[00:16:34] <Palmer11> button would be a sibling of input
[00:16:39] <Palmer11> div is the parent
[00:16:52] <Palmer11> or input is a sibling of button
[00:17:08] <Palmer11> you don‚Äôt fuck your parent or child do you?
[00:17:24] <Uhkis> well that escalated quickly
[00:17:54] <Palmer11> gotta give an example that would be remembered
[00:18:04] <Palmer11> how can you forget that
[00:18:15] <Uhkis> so you'd fuck your siblings ? ;D
[00:18:59] <DietDrK> that really didn't answer any questions
[00:19:12] <Palmer11> depends on which state you live in
[00:19:51] <Palmer11> lol, you have me there. I gotta rethink my entire process
[00:20:15] <socialblogsite> does anyone know a parallax plugin that does NOT expect the element‚Äôs setup defined as class names? I want to keep the html simple and setup the parallaxing elements in JS.
[00:20:52] <Uhkis> what's complex about class names..?
[00:21:58] <Palmer11> nothing
[00:22:20] <socialblogsite> Uhkis: I meant ‚ÄúI want the HTML code ‚Äúlean‚Äù.
[00:22:41] <socialblogsite> a bootstrap page is 10x times or more bigger than a custom css page. I want to keep it that way.
[00:23:19] <Uhkis> bootstrap?
[00:23:32] <Uhkis> adding classes to your html does not require bootstrap.
[00:23:37] <socialblogsite> twitter‚Äôs system to build pages
[00:23:44] <socialblogsite> it was an example
[00:24:15] <Uhkis> a few extra characters doesn't make it bootstrap-big
[00:24:20] <Palmer11> you don‚Äôt need an entire bootstrap file
[00:24:54] <socialblogsite> parallax scripts (at least popular ones) expect you to add classes to elements to know how and when to animate them. the end result is an html page full of classes (like bootstrap system builds layouts)
[00:25:22] <socialblogsite> uhkis: again, bootstrap was an example. Can we forget about it?
[00:26:25] <Uhkis> i just don't get why the hate on classes
[00:26:35] <socialblogsite> if you don‚Äôt know a parallax plugin that does NOT read classes and I can configure through JS, I‚Äôd appreciate you don‚Äôt put in doubt my needs and just say ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know any‚Äù :)
[00:27:08] <socialblogsite> I like lean html.
[00:28:57] <socialblogsite> defining ‚Äústacked-down stand-out green underlined round-edges animating-out‚Äù is a good way for a non-developer to use existing libraries, but makes the html code 10 times bigger than id=‚Äúbox1‚Äù.
[00:30:23] <Kartagis> Uhkis: maybe he failed his classes so that's why he hates classes?
[00:30:41] <socialblogsite> i prefer to use ‚Äúbox1‚Äù and load everything in the stylesheet and JS linked files which will be read ONCE, while the html pages, which are read hundreds of times an hour, to be lean.
[00:30:47] <Uhkis> socialblogsite: ah, you want lean html and messy js, ok ;-)
[00:30:58] <socialblogsite> messy?
[00:31:40] <socialblogsite> why would the js be messy?
[00:32:17] <socialblogsite> making a parallax plugin to read the classes makes it LONGER and more complicated tha just acepting an array
[00:32:33] <socialblogsite> anyway‚Ä¶
[00:32:56] <socialblogsite> has anyone tried parallax plugins?
[00:35:47] <Uhkis> parallax.js allows $(selector).parallax
[00:36:19] <dimi1947> cork/palmer...are you still there...I have made progress and I would like to ask one thing
[00:36:21] <Uhkis> http://pixelcog.github.io/parallax.js/ this one
[00:36:34] <Palmer11> uh
[00:36:55] <Palmer11> just ask, someone will always answer
[00:37:56] <dimi1947> is there a way with css to place an image icon inside a div(with a class)...background-image is not suited for that
[00:39:45] <DietDrK> if I'm just using a form now, how can I do it without a page redirect?
[00:40:34] <DietDrK> give all elements in the form a certain class and then use jquery selector to get all those name/valueS?
[00:41:19] <narik> can i change the input name using jquery?
[00:41:51] <Uhkis> narik: .attr('name', 'newname')
[00:42:09] <narik> Uhkis: Thanks :)
[00:42:09] <DietDrK> class is the right job for this, right?
[00:42:13] <DietDrK> as opposed to ID
[00:42:18] <narik> Will try now
[00:43:07] <Uhkis> DietDrK: TIL: it depends on who you ask :D
[00:43:25] <DietDrK> Seems like all of my questions are that way
[00:43:26] <Uhkis> DietDrK: but yeah, class sounds like the proper thing in this case
[00:43:51] <DietDrK> Seems like I just followed someone to stop doing AJAJ, but ends up I have to go back and do AJAJ again
[00:47:43] <stanford_drone> Does anyone know C/C++, Computer Vision/Image Processing, Machine Learning, AI, linux systems programming, or electronics? I'm looking for a programmer to join my Startup. We're going to China (manufacturing is there) from July to November. We're a team of 4. We're building a flying computer. A drone that you can play games with and install apps on.
[00:47:56] <Palmer11> ok, now you are just spamming
[00:48:06] <Palmer11> and clearly in the wrong channel
[00:48:43] <DietDrK> with a mediocre idea. #startups
[00:51:15] <narik> Uhkis: jQuery('#id').attr('name','newname')
[00:51:24] <narik> I tried it. But it didn't work
[00:51:34] <narik> didn't change the name of that input field
[00:53:29] <Uhkis> narik: http://jsfiddle.net/61o4cvv7/ yes it does
[01:11:08] <decx> change prop not attr
[01:12:43] <Cork> doesn't really matter for name
[01:12:55] <Cork> but ya, there isn't a reason to use attr there
[01:13:13] <decx> true, it's more of a general pointer i guess ^^
[01:13:24] <Cork> ya
[01:13:31] <decx> 11th commandment: stop using attr for everything
[01:13:44] <decx> too bad the 3rd stone broke
[01:13:58] <Cork> 12th commandment: only use attr if prop breaks the call
[01:14:02] <Cork> :P
[01:14:40] <Cork> that is a few cases though
[01:14:51] <Cork> prop('data-anything') won't work
[01:15:00] <Cork> prop('href') might not be what you want
[01:15:12] <decx> not?
[01:15:27] <decx> this.href seems proppy enough
[01:15:35] <Cork> no
[01:15:36] <Cork> depends
[01:15:51] <Cork> heh i thought you've seen me rant about that by now :)
[01:16:02] <Cork> <a href="#target">
[01:16:25] <Cork> this.href == "https://www.example.com/path/to/page#target"
[01:16:35] <decx> ah right
[01:16:35] <Cork> $(this).attr('href') == "#target"
[01:16:41] <decx> sometimes you dont want that
[01:17:07] <Cork> $($(this).attr('href')).focus()
[01:17:10] <Cork> for example :)
[01:17:21] <Cork> or scrollTo
[01:17:58] <decx> well good thing there's this.hash then ^^
[01:18:30] <Cork> heh true
[01:18:56] <decx> i tihnk i only use attr when is use attr in css
[01:19:03] <decx> i use*
[01:19:10] <decx> for content
[01:19:32] <Cork> heh
[01:19:37] <decx> still cant be used with calc tho
[01:19:41] * Cork checks if he uses attr in his tree
[01:19:42] <decx> bummer
[01:20:34] <Uhkis> name is a property?
[01:20:39] <Cork> its both
[01:21:02] <Cork> Uhkis: all attributes becomes a property too
[01:21:12] <Cork> but not all properties is a direct match to the attribute
[01:21:16] <Cork> .checked for example
[01:21:22] <Cork> .selected
[01:21:34] <decx> or everything in svg
[01:21:44] <Uhkis> i've been under the illusion that only booleans are properties
[01:21:57] <Cork> no, that isn't correct
[01:22:22] <Cork> <elm something="hello"> this.something == "hello"
[01:22:35] <decx> look at a this object in your dev tools
[01:22:41] <Cork> this.somethingthatdoesnotexist == ""
[01:23:05] <Cork> or was that null... >_<
[01:23:46] <Cork> its interesting when you haven't touched things for ages
[01:24:02] <decx> that's what my gran said too
[01:24:33] <Cork> O_o'
[01:24:53] <Cork> not sure i want to know what she was talking about...
[01:24:57] <decx> hey... silverplatter
[01:25:10] <decx> you cant give a setup like this
[01:25:12] <decx> ^^
[01:27:07] <Uhkis> :D
[02:14:36] <arup_r> Suppose I want to insert the contents inside the <div> tags, after clearing all its previous contents... What's the method there?? append() is not what I am looking for...
[02:15:02] <Cork> arup_r: .html(newContent)
[02:15:10] <arup_r> ok
[02:16:09] <arup_r> Cork: thanks
[02:16:15] <Cork> np
[02:16:46] <Cork> arup_r: btw, newContent doens't have to be html
[02:16:54] <Cork> it works with dom elements and jquery objects too
[02:17:03] <arup_r> ok..
[02:17:12] <arup_r> Cork: it is working as per my need
[02:17:23] <arup_r> I didn't know the method name..

[03:12:21] <Cork> if i'm here and free to answer i most likely will
[03:12:24] <Cork> else someone else will
[03:12:51] <dimi1947> I have placed an image icon inside a div...on....hover using  the background image property
[03:13:13] <dimi1947> nonethless I CANNOT adjust its position with CSS only
[03:13:44] <Cork> dimi1947: sure you can
[03:13:49] <Cork> background-position
[03:14:20] <Cork> (and padding)
[03:14:48] <dimi1947> oh...sorry...I have not used for a while CSS and I have forgottern some things
[03:15:18] <dimi1947> with the properties you mention can I adjust its position with px precision?
[03:16:03] <Cork> background-position
[03:16:16] <Cork> background-position: 0px 0px is top left
[03:16:22] <dimi1947> give me some nmutes to work on it...thanks
[03:16:42] <decx> oh i didnt know i was in #css
[03:16:45] <Cork> actially should have done

[03:16:53] <b-ot> Cork: background-position - CSS | MDN - Mozilla Developer Network ‚Üí https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background-position
[03:17:14] <Cork> decx: ya, but as ppl tend to use js WAY to much in here it leaks in here a lot ^^
[03:18:03] <anotheryou> May I ask for library/plugin suggestions here? I need a slideshow with true crossfades. Here an illustration of the problem: https://camo.githubusercontent.com/c150bec580fbf698478e89bd4a89f8056578c990/68747470733a2f2f662e636c6f75642e6769746875622e636f6d2f6173736574732f3636323837342f3433353930382f38383736373533342d623031332d313165322d383234652d3036666339386463303139382e706e67
[03:18:12] <decx> i don't mind the more involved problems but background position seems a bit primordial ^^
[03:19:05] <decx> what a weird requirement
[03:21:06] <decx> so it's always 2 elements with that offset?
[03:21:28] <decx> or is the offset just to show the layers
[03:24:10] <anotheryou> decx, you're speaking to me? the offset is just for the illustration. try to "fake-crossfade" two bright images on white. they will dip to grey in the middle.
[03:24:27] <decx> and it's always two or unlimited?
[03:24:34] <anotheryou> unlimited
[03:24:44] <decx> lol. two unlimited, you just got 90'd
[03:25:01] <Uhkis> :-D
[03:25:02] <anotheryou> the thing is, that the plugin needs to only fade in and shift the z-position. most are too lazy and just fade out one, while fading in the other
[03:25:32] <anotheryou> what :) ?
[03:25:36] <MarceColl> why could two same versions of jquery in different webpages on the same browser report different support for transition ($.support.transition)?
[03:25:52] <dimi1947> ok...cork here is the question...I have position the icon sueccesfully....and now I need to attach a click handler to it...is it possible....take in mind the fact that the icon is placed with a class and it is not contained in a a separate HTML element
[03:26:18] <decx> $.support is deprecated
[03:26:26] <Cork> dimi1947: no, you can't have event handling on somethign that isn't an element
[03:26:42] <MarceColl> decx, it's from bootstrap cdn, can't really change dthat
[03:26:59] <Cork> MarceColl: you would have to check the transition sniffer
[03:27:17] <dimi1947> I was afraid for that...what now....use jquey and disregard the css
[03:27:35] <Cork> dimi1947: you can't really do it with js either
[03:27:52] <anotheryou> decx, what my problem is: slow fades on images where there is a logo always an the same place. With a true crossfade you would not see tho logo fade out and in, it would look like an overlay. I could use a PNG, but than responsiveness (max-width of the whole banner) becomes a problem...
[03:27:54] <Cork> dimi1947: you seam to have assumed you can only do this with css if you don't need extra elements
[03:28:03] <Cork> dimi1947: just have the img tag there but hidden in normal cases
[03:28:14] <dimi1947> I understand....
[03:28:32] <dimi1947> Ok....I will try to do it
[03:28:35] <anotheryou> decx, and actually true crossfades are always prettier...
[03:29:35] <decx> well now you have to animate 2 instead of one
[03:29:47] <decx> so rewriting an existing script might be too involved
[03:30:50] <anotheryou> decx, the opposite is true. I need to animate just one :) the top image needs to fade in, the bottom must stay until it's completely covered
[03:31:06] <decx> but that's what every slideshow does and not what your image showed
[03:31:21] <anotheryou> decx, I shall prove you wrong...
[03:31:53] <decx> your images shows that you want the background to show
[03:32:03] <decx> ie the fading images meet at 50% in the middle
[03:32:26] <anotheryou> no. "current" and "correct" it says
[03:32:31] <anotheryou> I don't want "current" :)
[03:32:59] <decx> then why do you have a problem finding one?
[03:33:19] <anotheryou> decx, thy all do it showing the background allllll
[03:33:20] <decx> i've never seen the "current" way
[03:33:36] <anotheryou> decx, you just didn't mind the slight flash of white in a bright image
[03:33:53] <anotheryou> give me any script and I show you the mistake
[03:34:31] <decx> http://www.idangero.us/swiper/demos/16-effect-fade.html
[03:34:38] <decx> most starred slider on git
[03:36:19] <anotheryou> decx, completely broke when resizing my browser window, but you are right, they do it correctly :)
[03:37:16] <decx> flexslider does its fade animation like that too if you want the most popular jquery slider (by stars on git)
[03:38:14] <anotheryou> decx, this does not: http://slidesjs.com/examples/basic-fade/ and this http://snook.ca/technical/fade/fade.html# and this http://snook.ca/technical/fade/fade.html#
[03:38:22] <anotheryou> thank you :)
[03:39:30] <decx> that is a weird way to fade indeed
[03:40:32] <anotheryou> whops, the last link was ment to be bx-slider. whatever..
[03:40:38] <Cork> decx: what's so weird with that?
[03:40:49] <decx> like i want to see the background
[03:40:52] <decx> cmon
[03:41:16] <Cork> looks like a fairly simple crossfade to me
[03:41:19] <decx> the background can stay in the back, thank you very much
[03:45:44] <anotheryou> decx, flexslider bleeds the background too
[03:47:07] <decx> huh it does?
[03:47:12] <anotheryou> jup...
[03:47:20] <decx> now that you mention it i probably never used fade ^^
[03:47:46] <anotheryou> xD
[03:48:16] <Cork> well the white show through is kinda a must unless you put the second element infron/behind
[03:48:21] <Cork> and just fade one of them
[03:48:32] <Cork> (a fade i personally prefer)
[03:48:48] <decx> that's what i did when i tried to build one from hand because it's much easier to just have one element do stuff
[03:49:16] <Cork> it isn't THAT hard to do a true crossfade either
[03:49:36] <decx> well it's not hard, but it's more work
[03:49:44] <Cork> a tiny bit
[03:49:51] <decx> when's transition for image data coming again?
[03:50:14] <anotheryou> Cork, jup. no need some z-level trickery from last to first slide
[03:50:17] <Cork> css image crosstransition
[03:50:19] <decx> or was it in chrome already
[03:50:35] <Cork> anotheryou: not trickery
[03:50:46] <Cork> just a wrapper and an "old" image holder
[03:51:02] <Cork> <div class="wrapper"><img class="old"><img class="new"></div>
[03:51:13] <Cork> then you set the old image to the old image
[03:51:16] <anotheryou> Ah and than swap whats inside... makes sense
[03:51:20] <Cork> set the first one to opacity 0
[03:51:23] <anotheryou> jop
[03:51:25] <MarceColl> Cork, i cannot find the transition sniffer in the source code, does it come from another place?
[03:51:26] <anotheryou> I understand
[03:51:27] <Cork> and change the image and animate to opacity 1
[03:51:50] <Cork> MarceColl: just check form support.transition =
[03:52:00] <Cork> or possibly transition: (
[03:52:21] <Cork> anotheryou, decx: i've done that animation several times so... :)
[03:52:23] <Cork> know it well
[03:53:06] <MarceColl> Cork, checked for that, the search returns nothing, I'm a bit puzzled
[03:53:31] <Cork> MarceColl: you have a link to the page?
[03:53:38] <anotheryou> Cork, I once programmed it for 3 images for superdupersmooth transitions :)
[03:54:08] <anotheryou> Cork, but it was flash, back in the days (I'm glad it's over)
[03:54:14] <Cork> ya, the different causeless/slideshow plugins basically all suck
[03:54:21] <Cork> so i normally don't use them
[03:54:29] <Cork> anotheryou: ah...
[03:54:39] <Cork> well ya, css3 can do 99% of it now days
[03:54:51] <Cork> (you need to change the image and trigger the animation from js)
[03:55:17] <anotheryou> Cork, I needed it for Video and tweak the transition curve and so on https://vimeo.com/120573217
[03:56:50] <anotheryou> Cork, and than i wanted to have fades verry verry slow and you could see the jumps in the greyscale when fading black to white... but I was to lazy to implement dithering...
[03:56:55] <MarceColl> Cork, can't, it's on the company VPN, we're using the same jquery version (1.10.1) on both sites, and in the same browser it returns different support
[03:57:17] <Cork> MarceColl: ya, that description doesn't help at all
[03:57:27] <Cork> you need to check what is sniffing the transition
[03:57:32] <MarceColl> Cork, I know, I'm sorry
[03:57:33] <Cork> and what is tripping it up
[03:57:43] <Cork> so without the code i can't help
[03:58:05] <Cork> and no .transition isn't bundled with jquery as far as i know
[03:58:10] <Cork> i at least have my own
[03:59:01] <Cork> https://pastebin.mozilla.org/8834402
[03:59:32] <MarceColl> hmmm, then I don't understand why the other site is reporting transition, I'll keep investigating, thanks
[03:59:32] <MarceColl> will check that out, thanks
[04:21:34] <dimi1947> I have one question cork...is it better adding the img tag dynamically or hardcoding it...or you think it does not matter
[04:21:55] <Cork> dimi1947: depends how common it is going to be that you need it
[04:22:08] <Cork> constantly adding and removing elements is normally not a good thing
[04:23:45] <kk_drop> is it possible to block video by adding click or other event to parent element? http://jsfiddle.net/wjLL9f6z/
[04:24:08] <dimi1947> I understand..
[04:24:17] <Cork> kk_drop: no, events don't bubble cross documents
[04:24:43] <Cork> dimi1947: if it is going to be rare that you need the img, then have it in js
[04:24:54] <Cork> kk_drop: if it is going to be fairly common, leave it static
[04:24:55] <dimi1947> and why is it a bad thing to constantly add/remove elements....it is a question I have for a long time now in my mind
[04:25:18] <Cork> dimi1947: for two reasons
[04:25:28] <dimi1947> I am all ears
[04:25:31] <Cork> it causes more reflows then just changing a class
[04:25:41] <Cork> and it produces more garbage
[04:25:45] <Cork> so you might get gc hangs
[04:26:00] <dimi1947> gc hangs? what is that?
[04:26:08] <dimi1947> garbage collection?
[04:26:10] <Cork> Garbage Collection
[04:26:12] <Cork> yes
[04:26:33] <dimi1947> that is a big issue...I will search it my own
[04:27:07] <Cork> no it isn't a big issue...
[04:30:30] <dimi1947> OK I have create the img tag with display="none"...I assume the nex step is mouseenter  in the div where it is contained and make it show with a callback
[04:30:43] <Cork> uh no you don't
[04:30:56] <Cork> you just control that in the css
[04:31:05] <Cork> right where you show it if the selector matches
[04:32:09] <dimi1947> you mean I will use :hover again of css
[04:32:12] <dimi1947> ?
[04:32:34] <Cork> dimi1947: you need to learn the basics of css styling
[04:32:45] <Cork> and ya => #css
[04:33:38] <dimi1947> let me try some thing I will come back again later...
[04:35:33] <MerryBerry> Hi. How do I chain multiple jQuery.when? I know that you can do $.when(getX(),getY()).done(function() { getB(); }).done(function() { getC();})
[04:36:14] <Cork> MerryBerry: what exactly are you trying to do?
[04:37:36] <MerryBerry> but what about when you need to do wait for a bunch of deferreds instead of just 'getB()'
[04:37:57] <Cork> MerryBerry: again what exactly are you trying to do?
[04:38:11] <MerryBerry> I'm basically trying to do            $.when(getX(),getY()).when(function() { getB(), getB2(),getB3(),getB4() }).done(function() { getC();})
[04:38:23] <Cork> no that is how you're trying to implement it
[04:38:25] <MerryBerry> to be more precise
[04:38:28] <Cork> what are you trying to do
[04:38:35] <MerryBerry> I've got the following code           jQuery.when(getUser(settings), getPage()).then(function(user,page) { doStuff(user,page); }
[04:38:53] <MerryBerry> And I need to wrap that in             jquery.when(getSettings())
[04:39:25] <MerryBerry> so step1) get settings , step2) getUser, getPage, step3) doStuff with user and page
[04:39:58] <MerryBerry> I could of course do
[04:41:11] <MerryBerry> a WHEN followed by multiple DONE (one DONE for getUser and one for getPage)
[04:41:51] <MerryBerry> but I'm just wondering if there's any way that you don't have to do multiple DONEs
[04:42:09] <MerryBerry> I basically wanna call getPage and getUser inside a WHEN
[04:42:23] <MerryBerry> but from what I've seen you can't chanin WHENs
[04:42:35] <Uhkis> why not chain THENs
[04:43:43] <MerryBerry> that would be the same issue - I'd have to use one THEN for every deferred I wanna wait for
[04:43:45] <MerryBerry> right?
[04:44:11] <MerryBerry> So I can't replace my        when(getUser(settings), getPage())               with a then
[04:44:21] <kokut> Hello, anyone knows how to calculate an absolute positioned div height on resize?
[04:46:16] <SuperTyp> kokut: div resize or window resize?
[04:46:36] <kokut> SuperTyp: window
[04:47:13] <kokut> so im gonna trigger the calc on load then on resize
[04:47:18] <Cork> kokut: if you by calculate mean get it just use outerHeight()
[04:47:26] <kokut> i dont feel like making 300 different rules for every device
[04:48:24] <kokut> mmh loooks like it works :) ty cork
[04:51:50] <SuperTyp> Cork: I was setting up a jsfillde...
[04:51:55] <SuperTyp> :(
[04:57:42] <Uhkis> SuperTyp: be quick or be out-supported :D
[04:58:23] <SuperTyp> :D
[05:11:04] <dimi1947> cork I tried adding to the img element a class:hover with display: visible...but it does not work...it seems that the HTML attribute takes precedence
[05:11:29] <Cork> dimi1947: ya, like i said you should set it in the css...
[05:12:35] <dimi1947> I am setting it in the css......checked:hover{
[05:12:35] <dimi1947>     display:visible;
[05:12:35] <dimi1947>     }
[05:12:44] <Cork> ...
[05:12:44] <decx> there is no display: visible
[05:12:49] <Cork> there is no display: visible...
[05:13:00] <dimi1947> oh....what foolish of me
[05:13:17] <Cork> also like i said if you set display: none on the element css can't override that
[05:13:22] <Cork> so DO NOT SET IT ON THE ELEMENT...
[05:13:53] <dimi1947> ok
[05:14:08] <socialblogsite> is there anything wrong with this call? A console.log inside this $topnav.scroll( function(){   does absolutely nothing o_O ($topnav is my element, and it exists)
[05:14:28] <Mandevil> socialblogsite: Maybe it just never gets executed?
[05:15:31] <socialblogsite> Mandevil: THIS was my way to know ‚Äúit‚Äôs not executing‚Äù onScroll. (I asume you already confirmed there‚Äôs no syntax error there)
[05:15:59] <randomguy1> got a working example we could peruse?
[05:16:31] <decx> what a neat word "peruse"
[05:17:05] <socialblogsite> randomguy1: first, no, because it doesn‚Äôt work. second, it‚Äôs local only.
[05:17:21] <randomguy1> i like to mix it up, :D
[05:17:23] <socialblogsite> can jquery‚Äôs scroll() be re-defined by other scripts?
[05:17:29] <decx> doesnt mean you cant make a testcase
[05:18:03] <Mandevil> socialblogsite: OK, I misunderstood.
[05:18:08] <socialblogsite> im creating one. I just wanted to start with the syntax confirmation
[05:18:32] <decx> should do
[05:18:35] <Mandevil> Is there any good way to detect that an element became visible (due to viewport change)?
[05:18:57] <decx> element offsetY is smaller than scrollY+window height
[05:19:13] <Mandevil> decx: Yeah, but somehow I'd like to receive an event...
[05:19:30] <decx> no
[05:19:37] <decx> i guess you could write one but that's inane
[05:19:52] <Mandevil> There's jquery.appear plugin that does it.
[05:19:55] <Mandevil> But badly.
[05:19:56] <decx> map your offsets into an array and loop through that on scroll/resize
[05:20:06] <Mandevil> Hm.
[05:20:26] <Mandevil> Let's see if it can be done.
[05:20:27] <decx> or if you dont enjoy performance loop through yorur elements
[05:20:38] <decx> and get their offsetY on every scroll/resize
[05:21:08] <Mandevil> I guess the browser itself has to know.
[05:21:19] <dimi1947> cork thaks for your patience...just wanted to say that
[05:21:20] <Mandevil> So it's just not exposed to user.
[05:23:41] <socialblogsite> test case: http://jsfiddle.net/av5v3n7L/   IT HAS to be the syntax o_O
[05:23:49] <socialblogsite> the console logs nothing.
[05:24:58] <socialblogsite> not even with the console.log before the if http://jsfiddle.net/av5v3n7L/1/
[05:26:11] <MerryBerry> tried doing a promise chain using WHEN > THEN > WHEN       but it seems like I can't pass variables to that last WHEN function
[05:26:16] <decx> sure it does
[05:26:26] <decx> socialblogsite: http://jsfiddle.net/av5v3n7L/2/
[05:26:46] <MerryBerry>   $.when(getA()).then(function(a) { $.when( doSomething(a) ) })              <-------------a will be "undefined"
[05:27:58] <Cork> MerryBerry: please stop pasting so much code in the channel
[05:28:14] <MerryBerry> ^ It has a value when you break before that final WHEN. but only "undefined" is passed to doSomething()
[05:28:30] <randomguy1> You tried doing something like this MerryBerry? http://jsfiddle.net/e7dp08wt/
[05:28:50] <socialblogsite> docx: thanks. it seems I misundersood the usage of scroll(). I should have attached scroll to window, not the element.
[05:29:06] <decx> there you go
[05:29:33] <MerryBerry> Cork: alright
[05:30:04] <MerryBerry> randomguy1: Exactly! Thanks. For some reason I couldn't seem to get the variables passed correctly to the WHEN when I tried to do the same thing
[05:32:04] <socialblogsite> decx: You just answered to another guy what I was asking yesterday :) Did you remember my question from yesterday? (mapping the offsets in an array to reduce pinging the DOM with positioning questions
[05:32:59] <decx> no i was playing witcher 3 all day
[05:33:22] <decx> but yeah, mapping into an array and compare to that is much nicer
[05:34:35] <decx> these rapid fire events like scroll and resize can get out of hand fast if you go through too many elements
[05:37:54] <arc_> okay i've been banging my head against this for long enough
[05:38:12] <randomguy1_> hurts the noggin
[05:38:22] <arc_> there is an "scroll to top" element that is only supposed to appear on mobile
[05:38:42] <arc_> i was messing with the logo div trying to get it to appear larger, but doing so messed up the whole mobile layout so i just went back to normal
[05:38:57] <arc_> but now that scroll to top element is appearing on the desktop site, in the wrong position
[05:39:00] <arc_> http://porath.org/w/mcc5/aboutus.html
[05:39:07] <arc_> if you scroll past y 200, it will appear
[05:39:13] <MerryBerry> randomguy: well, actually, to be precises - it's like this http://jsfiddle.net/e7dp08wt/2/
[05:39:22] <arc_> i cannot figure out why it is. it's supposed to only appear below a certain width, which this is not
[05:39:35] <MerryBerry> randomguy1: well, actually, to be precises - it's like this http://jsfiddle.net/e7dp08wt/2/
[05:39:39] <decx> that's the biggest totop element i've ever seen
[05:39:42] <MerryBerry> and I'm having a weird issue
[05:39:52] <arc_> well, it's not supposed to be there at all :p
[05:39:58] <MerryBerry> seems like the settings object can't be passed to the inner WHEN function
[05:40:11] <decx> well do a mobile check
[05:40:43] <arc_> i'm sure it already is. this is a theme i bought, and it was working before i started messing with the logo css
[05:40:44] <randomguy1> MerryBerry: what about this? http://jsfiddle.net/e7dp08wt/3/
[05:40:50] <MerryBerry> does anyone have a good fiddle with some dummy-promises-functions I could test on?
[05:42:53] <pauled> Hi, is possible to call a function from console in jsfiddle
[05:43:49] <pauled> by function I mean a group of command
[05:44:11] <randomguy1> pauled: I typically create a dummy button that I can click to execute whatever I want on demand in a jsfiddle
[05:44:25] <randomguy1> but probably possible from console
[05:44:32] <pauled> ah thanks
[05:44:37] <pauled> smart
[05:45:39] <randomguy1> some say smart, others say lazy, :D
[05:46:10] <pauled> yeah it's compatible :)
[05:50:26] <leporello> Hi. There is a question. May be more JS than jQuery itself, but anyway.
[05:50:58] <randomguy1> leporello: go for it
[05:51:14] <dimi1947> cork I use css('display','none') to hide the element....
[05:51:21] <leporello> I wrote jquery plugin which operates on data-attribute of element, which i take by el.data('myAttr). It's an array of arrays.
[05:51:34] <randomguy1> dimi1947: that puts it directly on the element
[05:51:34] <Cork> sigh... fine
[05:51:58] <Cork> dimi1947: i don't have strentgh to keep running in this wheel
[05:51:59] <leporello> Then I do some black magic with it, it's complex algebra, even don't want to know what exactly.
[05:52:04] <Cork> use js and ignore css
[05:52:27] <dimi1947> what that phrase you wrote mean>
[05:52:48] <leporello> And every plugin launch my data are changing. They don't change in element, but if i do console.log they change
[05:52:53] <Cork> dimi1947: that use js as your stylesheet i give up
[05:53:20] <Cork> i've spent WAY more time then i have to spend on getting you to do it right
[05:53:24] <Cork> so use a hack solution
[05:53:27] <MerryBerry> randomguy1: hmm creating a local var didn't help either. I thought it would do the trick, but nope. seems like I can't pass anything from the context inside the THEN
[05:53:45] <dimi1947> ok then
[05:53:52] <randomguy1> MerryBerry: weird. you may have to resort to a more global variables then, :s
[05:54:11] <randomguy1> MerryBerry: maybe a localStorage variable
[05:54:20] <leporello> http://pastebin.com/aBAekt0w - here is example
[05:54:48] <MerryBerry> randomguy1: yep, that has to work
[05:55:17] <leporello> Seems like $.data() get's not value, but reference to that data
[05:55:30] <leporello> which can be changed if data is an array for example
[05:56:09] <leporello> but they still data-my-attr="[ something constant ]" in chrome dom view
[05:57:00] <randomguy1> leporello: I believe it is a true statement that the page html does not always reflect the state of the element in the dom.  More so how it was on load.
[05:57:19] <randomguy1> leporello: So what you see in the html, may differ from say $(selector).prop('something')
[05:59:00] <leporello> randomguy1, so I need to do a copy of my attribute?
[05:59:07] <leporello> because I can overwrite it?
[05:59:44] <randomguy1> leporello: No, what I'm suggesting is if your concerned because you see a disconnect between the html you see and the values you get in execution that you shouldn't be concerned about that.
[06:00:10] <randomguy1> leporello: apart from any issues you may be having, of course
[06:02:09] <arc_> oh my god are you fucking kidding me
[06:02:22] <arc_> well, i figured out why it was doing that
[06:02:39] <randomguy1> arc_: 1, problem: 0
[06:02:40] <arc_> the css that came with the theme had a typo
[06:02:47] <arc_> html, hmtl a{
[06:02:57] <arc_> i fixed that, and didn't notice any changes, so i figured it was fine
[06:03:19] <arc_> only hours later did i notice the scroll to top thing
[06:03:39] <arc_> so i didn't think about it
[06:04:07] <arc_> i only discovered it by comparing the changed file to a copy of the original
[06:05:02] <leporello> does $.extend([], something) do copy of something?
[06:05:26] <randomguy1> leporello: I believe it is a merge of sorts
[06:06:12] <randomguy1> a jq guru may corrext me
[06:08:45] <pauled> How to call jsfiddle to re-run the page ?
[06:09:30] <arc_> just click run again
[06:10:22] <pauled> I have a button with function that delete my customs localstorage items and for easy debuging, I want that function re-run the page
[06:14:31] <randomguy1> pauled: the run button may have an id on it?  see if you can get a selector for it that you can .click()
[06:14:57] <pauled> ah yes :))
[06:15:03] <pauled> thanks :))
[06:15:22] <pauled> hmm
[06:15:41] <leporello> randomguy1, i do copy of my data atribute and it still change with every function run
[06:15:47] <pauled> I don't think I can target a outside html element
[06:15:48] <leporello> WHY?
[06:16:10] <randomguy1> pauled: maybe not
[06:16:34] <r08o> Hello. This is a noob question, but I can't seem to select the search button in the standard bootstrap navbar, using jquery. How do I do this? Have tried giving it an id="searchButton" and then $.("searchButton") but it doesn't work.
[06:16:51] <randomguy1> leporello: got a fiddle of it?
[06:17:07] <leporello> r08o, $('#id'), not $('id')
[06:17:48] <r08o> leporello, sorry. "#id" was what I meant and is what I am doing
[06:17:49] <leporello> randomguy1, it's hard to cut, better link to project :)
[06:18:16] <randomguy1> was $.( a typo?
[06:19:25] <Eduard_Munteanu> How do I make blueimp's jQuery File Upload start uploads on the press of a button, rather than upon selection of files?
[06:20:26] <Eduard_Munteanu> I tried setting autoUpload to false, but I don't know how to trigger upload.
[06:20:34] <Mandevil> Why can't I update the same jQuery object twice to the same parent element? It only gets inserted once.
[06:20:40] <Mandevil> Is there a check for duplicity or something?
[06:21:58] <r08o> leporello, this is the fiddle https://jsfiddle.net/zatcd5c8/
[06:25:20] <randomguy1> mmm, breakfast burrito devoured.  Mandevil: 'update' how?
[06:27:19] <randomguy1> r08o: I'm getting an error in the console when I try to search on that jsfiddle. "Blocked loading mixed active content "http://api.flickr.com/services/feeds/phot..."
[06:27:49] <randomguy1> r08o: do you get that on the actual site, or is that only showing on jsfiddle?
[06:28:42] <r08o> randomguy1, only in jsfiddle. Not getting anything on actual site.
[06:29:11] <r08o> randomguy1, If I make the search field outside the navbar it works as it should
[06:29:48] <r08o> with the same ID's. Which is why I think I am selecting it "wrong".
[06:30:14] <pauled> randomguy1: trying $( "iframe" ).parent().click("#run");
[06:31:36] <randomguy1> r08o: in the case that it's not working, if you put a console.log() right at the start of the click handler, do you see that execute?
[06:32:08] <ashopin> Good morning. I need a bit of help with jquery and timing. I'm using jquery.validate to validate a form. I'd like to add a modal that only shows when the form is valid but my code doesn't return the accurate valid true/false value. It always see the form as valid even when it's not. I believe it's because it fires before the jquery.validate has a chance to do it's thing. How can I delay my code?
[06:32:12] <randomguy1> pauled: others may correct me, but I'm not sure that a child document in an iframe can access parent elements
[06:32:22] <pauled> oh wait there is no ifram if I change to the domain http://fiddle.jshell.net/
[06:33:24] <pauled> argg I am wrong there is iframe
[06:33:25] <randomguy1> ashopin: got a fiddle example?
[06:33:27] <leporello> r08o, http://plnkr.co/edit/Ym8xMF5aTswaDIJd211O?p=preview
[06:35:16] <ashopin> randomguy1: sorry, it's part of a cms so it's tough to separate
[06:35:39] <r08o> randomguy1, leporello No, nothing is logged to the console.
[06:36:29] <ashopin> randomguy1: this is my code. http://pastebin.com/3w2it30z when I console.log form.valid(), it always shows true so I can't use that as the condition
[06:37:43] <leporello> r08o, are, sure
[06:38:09] <leporello> you should put all that click code to $(document).ready(function(){ ... });
[06:38:17] <randomguy1> ashopin: I'm a validate noob, but in examples I've seen in the past they provided rules to the validate to know when something is invalid or valid.  I don't see that here.  Are you doing that else where?
[06:38:20] <leporello> or just $(function(){...});
[06:39:07] <r08o> leporello, it shows in the console very quickly. and then dissapears.
[06:40:03] <ashopin> randomguy1: I'm trying to piggy back on the jquery.validate module that I want to time my code with
[06:40:09] <randomguy1> r08o: dissapears?  is the page reloading?
[06:40:58] <randomguy1> r08o: hah, that element is a submit button
[06:41:12] <r08o> randomguy1, aha.
[06:41:45] <randomguy1> r08o: um, try changing it to a regular input type="button" and then when everthing is good do a $('form').submit().  See if that works
[06:42:53] <r08o> randomguy1, haha. that did the trick. Jesus Christ I feel stupid :P
[06:43:09] <randomguy1> ^_^ all been there
[06:43:11] <r08o> Only took me 2 hours :)
[06:43:26] <r08o> Thanks a lot though!
[06:46:21] <randomguy1> ashopin: not sure.  one point of concern I do see though with your snipplet is your binding the click event inside the handler to, it looks like, the same elements.  If that outer event happens multiple times, you'll have multiple bindings ot your inputs with the same handler.  might want to rethink that
[06:46:49] <ashopin> randomguy1: I figured it out I think. I'm checking 'form' but htis is a multipage form so it wasn't looking at the page I was on.
[06:47:00] <ashopin> Thanks for your help! randomguy1++
[06:47:59] <randomguy1> ashopin: good deal.  however, do please review the inner binding thing too, :)
[06:48:56] <ashopin> randomguy1: I reverted it so it's not including that binding. I was grasping at straws last night. Now, I just use good ol' document.ready
[06:49:28] <randomguy1> ashopin: to get the relevant form are you trying $(this).closest('form') ?
[06:50:10] <ashopin> randomguy1: No, I have a specific ID I'm actually using. I was overlooking the basics trying to figure out htis issue. I added a setTimeout to my function to see if it was the firing order that was the problem and it wasn't.
[06:51:47] <randomguy1> Hah, we had that the other day.  Had a binding that was happening on a ton of elements on page load, which was causing a 2min response time increase.  Changed it to bind on focus, but then since it was binding last, the order changed, and things dorked up >_<
[06:52:10] <ashopin> randomguy1: the more I learn the more of hte basics I neglect and it always comes back to bite me.
[06:53:55] <Mandevil> So I finally figured out lazy loading for a gallery... and it doesn't work in Chrome.
[06:55:03] <Mandevil> But it works in IE ....
[06:55:11] <Mandevil> What gives?
[06:55:34] <ashopin> Must be backwards day
[06:56:07] <Mandevil> As if I were using advanced features...
[06:56:36] <Mandevil> Tell me what in this doesn't work with Chrome: https://voyager.lupomesky.cz/fotky/tracy/trgallery.js
[06:57:22] <SuperTyp> ffs...http://pastie.org/10202204 to submit my second form (upload line 39) I need to double press the submit button...this is because of the ev.preventDefault() but how can I solve this?
[06:57:29] <SuperTyp> http://pastie.org/10202204
[06:58:25] <SuperTyp> I need to delegate the event binding to parent so the event is binded to the form, but the validator comes with its own submitHandler...
[06:58:44] <SuperTyp> because form comes with ajax
[06:58:55] <Mandevil> Hm, reloaded and it works...
[06:58:57] <Mandevil> Sigh.
[06:59:45] <SuperTyp> please anybody I am working on that for hours
[07:04:18] <Eduard_Munteanu> How do I make blueimp's jQuery File Upload start uploads on the press of a button, rather than upon selection of files?
[07:04:30] <Eduard_Munteanu> I tried setting autoUpload to false, but I don't know how to trigger upload.
[07:14:32] <randomguy1> SuperTyp: I think your issue is in your submitHandler.  Your binding to your #upload in there.  So until it fires once, that button will not have that handler.  Second time it will.
[07:14:55] <randomguy1> SuperTyp: If you want it to happen the first time, you'll have to pull that out elsewhere
[07:15:34] <randomguy1> sorry for delay, had standup and some official work work :D
[07:21:22] <vivekananda> hi everyone
[07:21:38] <vivekananda> managed to solve most of my problems yesterday but stuck with some
[07:23:29] <randomguy1> vivekananda: your suspense is killing us, ;)  just ask
[07:24:12] <vivekananda> lol okay. Gimme a sec I have to write a skeleton code first to ask a proper question
[07:24:33] <randomguy1> vivekananda: i like you already
[07:28:32] <vivekananda> randomguy1, you wont in a min :)
[07:29:37] <vivekananda> so here is my code --- http://pastie.org/10202244   . Now this code is working for me. There are glitches though. Eg if I switch tabs after .keyup() but before ajax finishes I see that gif rotation doesn't end.
[07:30:28] <SuperTyp> randomguy1: pull out what ? the submitHandler?
[07:30:47] <honestemu> Any of you have experience using the tablesorter module?https://www.npmjs.com/package/tablesorter
[07:31:03] <randomguy1> SuperTyp: Your binding on '#upload'
[07:31:34] <SuperTyp> how?
[07:31:51] <SuperTyp> sorry I really tried thousand things I am just exaused somehow
[07:32:03] <Mandevil> honestemu: I think that's the one I use.
[07:32:14] <randomguy1> SuperTyp: gonna pull it over to a jsfiddle so I can edit
[07:32:45] <SuperTyp> I even tried to set up a full jsfiddle but I failed using the ajax api there :>
[07:34:01] <randomguy1> SuperTyp: what you have is http://jsfiddle.net/ytf7svLv/ , by pulling it out you'd have something like http://jsfiddle.net/ytf7svLv/1/
[07:34:35] <honestemu> Mandevil: Have you had any luck getting the up/down buttons to display? I can't seem to get it to work. I am attempting to use the green theme from here: http://tablesorter.com/docs/
[07:34:48] <Mandevil> honestemu: Works fine for me.
[07:35:07] <randomguy1> vivekananda: Not sure, but it looking like you trying to bind a keyup event to a function.... ?
[07:35:13] <honestemu> Mandevil: Alrighty. I'll give it another look.
[07:35:27] <Mandevil> honestemu: I have implemented that something like 6-10 months ago...
[07:35:41] <Mandevil> honestemu: So if there are new bugs... I don't know.
[07:36:09] <Mandevil> honestemu: Here's one page I use it for: https://voyager.lupomesky.cz/nh/devnull/2014/ascended.html
[07:36:27] <vivekananda> randomguy1, yeah . the keyup works fine for most cases. The problem is that during specific cases eg moving a different tab and then coming back the animation gets triggered but never ends  ie the ajax call doesn't go through
[07:36:32] <vivekananda> is this expected ?
[07:36:47] <Mandevil> honestemu: Note that I use custome sorter...
[07:36:56] <vivekananda> I assumed that if keyup works then that means the other parts of the function would also work
[07:39:25] <vivekananda> or atleast be called
[07:40:36] <SuperTyp> randomguy1: same behaviour :(
[07:40:38] <randomguy1> that's interesting.  didn't realize you could bind an event to a function.  thought it had to be a selector element
[07:40:41] <SuperTyp> need to click submit button twice
[07:41:28] <SuperTyp> I have to leave now, cya later thanks randomguy1 for your help
[07:41:29] <vivekananda> randomguy1, if you care to look I can show you exactly what is happening.
[07:41:55] <hk3380> how can i have a `hover()` method apply to non-existant elements that will exist later on?
[07:42:01] <teza19> Hi, I'm trying to use the 'val' variable outside the current function, but it's coming up as 'undefined'. How can I parse it through? http://jsfiddle.net/49y6ps5h/
[07:42:50] <Mandevil> teza19: Iz the request succeeding?
[07:42:54] <Mandevil> teza19: Is it valid JSON?
[07:43:05] <Mandevil> teza19: Check in the dev tools of your browser (or Firebug).
[07:43:11] <teza19> Mandevil: 100%. If I run a console.log(val); within the function, it works fine
[07:43:59] <randomguy1> hk3380: your interested in a mouseover event.  for future elements you could bind on a parent element with a delegate so future elements would work too (ex. $(parent).on('mouseover', 'childSelector', function(){ ... });
[07:44:33] <Mandevil> teza19: Tried using 'var val;' before the $.get?
[07:44:49] <andrew-l> Mandevil: exactly what i was going to suggest
[07:45:21] <randomguy1> teza19: http://api.jquery.com/jquery.getjson/  consider using a .done() handler
[07:45:54] <Mandevil> Hate how jsfiddle blocks ctrl+t (new tab)
[07:46:42] <teza19> Mandevil and all: http://jsfiddle.net/49y6ps5h/1/
[07:46:48] <teza19> a little context and surrounding code
[07:47:10] <Mandevil> Is 'data' defined?
[07:47:13] <randomguy1> teza19: actually, your kinda already doing that.  essentially, you need to call the function you want to operate on inside the val from within your existing logic, to ensure the ajax request has finished and the value is available
[07:47:13] <Mandevil> In the function?
[07:47:25] <Mandevil> Oh, I see.
[07:47:27] <CreativeWolf> Heya all :)
[07:47:34] <CreativeWolf> I'm using Cordova and jQuery Mobile and the date picker works fine on Browser, on my Phone but not on a Tablet, any pointers please?
[07:47:56] <Mandevil> teza19: Strange, this should work.
[07:47:59] <vivekananda> randomguy1, yeah. it works fine for the most part . if you want the actual function here it is -- https://gist.github.com/vvikramjhu/559a19ef3f658e0af4ae
[07:48:28] <teza19> Mandevil: it's confusing me too!
[07:48:54] <randomguy1> vivekananda: aaaaah, makes more sense , :D
[07:49:17] <Mandevil> teza19: Oh, now I understand it.
[07:49:17] <vivekananda> randomguy1, I put up the skeleton to highlight important parts
[07:49:24] <Mandevil> teza19: It's typical mistake :)
[07:50:05] <teza19> Mandevil: has it got to do with the variable being local to the function?
[07:50:05] <Mandevil> teza19: The function() is called asynchronously... you are checking the val outside before the $.get completes!
[07:50:25] <Mandevil> teza19: You can't write like this.
[07:50:51] <teza19> Mandevil: so, how do I fix i?
[07:50:57] <Mandevil> teza19: So normally you would write anything that depends on data inside the function.
[07:51:23] <randomguy1> vivekananda: so you said something about it works, unless you decide to move another 'tab' during the other tabs move?
[07:51:30] <teza19> Mandevil: I tried putting the point.update(val); in the function, but that didn't work
[07:51:41] <Mandevil> What's point.update()?
[07:52:25] <teza19> Mandevil: it's a gauge chart that I'm using to update stats
[07:52:58] <Mandevil> teza19: And "doesn't work" means what? Nothing happens? Error is raised?
[07:53:15] <teza19> Mandevil: fair call, sorry. No errors, it just does not update at all
[07:53:57] <Mandevil> teza19: It should work. If it doesn't, you should try to trace if the point.update is called.
[07:54:07] <Mandevil> teza19: Maybe use debugger and "step into"
[07:54:21] <Mandevil> teza19: Know how to use debugger?
[07:54:21] <andrew-l> teza19: have you seen this? http://stackoverflow.com/a/10785423/1383110
[07:54:27] <teza19> Mandevil: it works if add add 'val = 3;' outside the function
[07:54:58] <Mandevil> teza19: That's not very helpful.
[07:55:24] <Mandevil> teza19: If the call from inside the function fail, you need to find out why.
[07:55:44] <teza19> Mandevil: I'm fairly new to JQuery, so I'm not sure how to debug it efficiently
[07:55:56] <CreativeWolf> Can someone help with the datepicker thats not working on tablet but works on phone please?
[07:56:41] <Mandevil> teza19: Put breakpoint into the function() body (on the first line of it).
[07:56:49] <Mandevil> teza19: Then step line by line.
[07:57:02] <Mandevil> teza19: When you are on the point.update(), try to use Step In.
[07:57:11] <Mandevil> teza19: That should bring you into that function.
[07:57:24] <randomguy1> teza19: if there is an error something should show up in your browser console.  you could also add some console.log() for 'point' to make sure it is defined at the time you try to use it.  and maybe even in the update function to make sure your going inside it
[07:58:52] <teza19> randomguy1: point is definitely defined. There's nothing in the console window
[07:59:42] <dimi1947> I have used hover() to make an img show and hide when the cursor enters a div....how I can remove this handler though when a checkbox is ticked
[08:00:27] <teza19> http://jsfiddle.net/49y6ps5h/2/ some more context
[08:01:39] <Mandevil> teza19: Do you have jQuery enable in jsfiddle?
[08:01:47] <Mandevil> teza19: In the Frameworks&Extensions?
[08:01:52] <vivekananda> randomguy1, I meant that it works as long as I am on the same page. It doesn't if I move a different tab and then move back to this webpage tab
[08:01:59] <Mandevil> teza19: It comes to me as disabled in the fiddle.
[08:02:22] <teza19> Mandevil: yeah it's disabled. I'm just using JSFiddle as a pastebin. The code won't run there
[08:02:28] <Mandevil> Ah.
[08:02:35] <teza19> Mandevil: let me make some changes to make it work there
[08:02:52] <randomguy1> vivekananda: 'move' being having multiple tabs open and clicking to another one?  or actually navigating away from the page in the tab and then returning?
[08:03:15] <vivekananda> yeah move means focus out of the current tab and focus in to another
[08:03:31] <teza19> Mandevil: I think it may take me too much time to get all the code over. I can't understand why it's not working!
[08:03:41] <vivekananda> randomguy1, or even focus out of explorer to the desktop and coming back
[08:05:34] <Mandevil> teza19: Learn to use debugger.
[08:05:42] <Mandevil> teza19: You will need that.
[08:06:44] <randomguy1> vivekananda: curious.  try this.  put a console.log in your keyup logic and in the part before you ajax.  see if the keyup one fires and the ajax one does not when you do that focus change.
[08:07:58] <vivekananda> randomguy1, did one better. I put breaks and ran the page ( chrome devtools). I find that the lines 98-105 execute then nothing ( https://gist.github.com/vvikramjhu/559a19ef3f658e0af4ae )
[08:08:20] <vivekananda> randomguy1, if I stay on the page then everything works fine
[08:08:27] <vivekananda> :). go figure !!
[08:09:43] <randomguy1> vivekananda: alright so, now, try breaking it apart.  Store the object your binding the keyup to to a variable, then bind the keyup to that variable.  then console.log the variable to see exactly which element(s) that function is returning for you to bind on
[08:10:17] <leporello> new problem
[08:10:32] <randomguy1> vivekananda: or i guess in the keyup you could log $(this) and that would tell ya too
[08:10:40] <leporello> why could img.clientWidth be 0 even in $(window).load&
[08:10:41] <leporello> ?
[08:12:17] <leporello> oh, i know
[08:12:21] <leporello> because it's hidden :)
[08:14:12] <vivekananda> randomguy1, doing log $(this) will that me what object keyup() is connected to. But that would be fine coz the keyup starts and finishes fine. ie, 105 executes fine but the problem is line 10 is not reached at all during tab cycle !!. It reaches during constant tab focus
[08:15:16] <randomguy1> vivekananda: right, what I'm wondering is if some how it is getting bound to something that would cause it to trigger when you do the focus change, other than on the classes you are trying to bind on
[08:16:17] <randomguy1> vivekananda: but the focus change your doing with mouse events, not the keyboard i assume, which doesn't make sense eitehr
[08:17:35] <vivekananda> randomguy1, lemme show you the issue directly as well. gimme a min
[08:24:16] <vivekananda> randomguy1, someone suggested that I shouldn't start the gif animation until I am acutally starting the ajax ie sending the rquest. so I did that
[08:25:12] <randomguy1> vivekananda: heh, could work too
[08:28:50] <robertmaxrees> gooood morning #jquery
[08:28:54] <robertmaxrees> and happy friday!
[08:29:54] <randomguy1> sweet max is here.  someone who knows stuff, :D
[08:30:02] <robertmaxrees> offff
[08:30:06] <robertmaxrees> *pffff bullshit.
[08:30:09] <randomguy1> lol
[08:30:12] <robertmaxrees> i am simply the best rubber duck in the world.
[08:31:08] <randomguy1> best or most vocal?
[08:32:24] <vivekananda> hi robertmaxrees
[08:32:30] <vivekananda> I am back with the same thing
[08:32:41] <vivekananda> I thought I had solved it but apparently new problems arose
[08:33:28] <robertmaxrees> okay lol
[08:35:49] <randomguy1> vivekananda: did you update your a.js file?
[08:36:01] <vivekananda> ?
[08:36:06] <vivekananda> update meaning ?
[08:36:13] <randomguy1> you made changes to that version, yes?
[08:36:51] <vivekananda> randomguy1, yeah I am making changes directly to the source file so it is automatically getting updated
[08:37:21] <robertmaxrees> vivekananda so have you made any isolated test cases like we talked about yesterday?
[08:37:38] <vivekananda> randomguy1, here is a link in case you wanted to have a look. https://568d7baa.ngrok.com/test2/safeview/www/ . I think I solved the issue. now the current issue is that if I move away from the page and come back then the dropdown disappears
[08:38:02] <randomguy1> there's the money link
[08:38:40] <robertmaxrees> i'm about to put a moratorium on links like that.
[08:38:51] <vivekananda> robertmaxrees, sadly I couldn't coz I didn't know what part to isolate. If I knew that I can as easily debug or solve the issue itself
[08:38:51] <randomguy1> where's the dropdown?
[08:39:04] <robertmaxrees> vivekananda what's the specific issue you're having?
[08:39:06] <robertmaxrees> start there.
[08:39:16] <delboy1978uk> any text field? that one??
[08:39:18] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, I'm going to start telling people to not help you.
[08:39:58] <vivekananda> the specific issue is that the code execution stops after a particular line on page change. I don't understand why. It works fine on remaining on the same page
[08:40:26] <delboy1978uk> vivekananda: This site makes use of a SHA-1 Certificate; it's recommended you use certificates with signature algorithms that use hash functions stronger than SHA-1.
[08:40:34] <robertmaxrees> i doubt all code execution stops
[08:40:43] <delboy1978uk> fyi
[08:41:00] <randomguy1> right, but you said the dropdown disappears.  which one?
[08:42:06] <vivekananda> robertmaxrees, I am not trying to get someone to do a job for me or help me with something they would rather not. Also, for the present issue I mostly have it resolved. There are just pieces glitching and I am not sure if it is my system of a version of js or what that is causing irratic behaviour. As to you wanting or not wanting to help me is fine but I guess you should let others choose if they wish to or not unless
[08:42:09] <delboy1978uk> yeah where is this elusive <select >?
[08:42:11] <vivekananda> this is not a democracy. If I am neglecting part of the honor code here or rules then lemme know first
[08:43:02] <vivekananda> randomguy1, if you type in mic and wait you see a dropdown. If you then move to a different page and then come back the dropdown disappears
[08:43:11] <vivekananda> does that not hoppen with you ?
[08:43:31] <randomguy1> i'm uncertain where i should type.  mic?  you mean user login?
[08:43:47] <vivekananda> no scroll down and type in the search
[08:43:51] <randomguy1> k
[08:44:46] <delboy1978uk> seems to work fine here
[08:45:18] <delboy1978uk> i then clicked alerts afterwards, then clicked home and tried again. no fault found?
[08:45:18] <randomguy1> hmm, without navigating away if i search for 'testing', i cannot click the x to make it go away, nor the dropdown to the left does nothing
[08:48:28] <randomguy1> k, so i got it to do it
[08:49:03] <randomguy1> i'd imagine whatever that makes the dropdown show has a blur event that makes it go away.  the blur would trigger when you change tabs
[08:50:04] <randomguy1> so whatever you have bound to your change event, you might want to also trigger on focus
[08:50:30] <Lencl> $(element).css('background')... returns true or false if there's a background style in the element?
[08:50:52] <randomguy1> Lencl: returns the value of background on the element, if it is set
[08:51:05] <Lencl> ah okay
[09:18:44] <testerbit> When I request a modal to be opened it closes automatically in firefox. What can be done to stop this? http://pastebin.com/LnBpBEHY
[09:20:26] <robertmaxrees> run stopPropagation() against the event opject.
[09:20:30] <robertmaxrees> *object
[09:20:49] <robertmaxrees> http://fixee.org/paste/shjwbfb/ like this.
[09:22:10] <testerbit> robertmaxrees: add a variable to the anonymous function?
[09:22:26] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[09:22:40] <robertmaxrees> $(".btn-verify-request").click(function(e) {}); just names the argument that's getting passed by .click() so you can use it.
[09:22:42] <testerbit> instead of function(), you made it function(e)
[09:23:06] <testerbit> robertmaxrees: would this.stopPropagation(); work as well?
[09:23:16] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[09:23:27] <robertmaxrees> because 'this' would be the dom element, not the event object.
[09:23:38] <testerbit> ok
[09:24:03] <robertmaxrees> you need to name the event object itself.
[09:24:11] <robertmaxrees> that's what my example does.
[09:31:52] <mcfdez87> Hello. I'm trying to replace a html with onclick function but I not get results. Any suggestion please? http://jsfiddle.net/vmmf5o3L/
[09:32:02] <robertmaxrees> don't use onclick=
[09:32:55] <testerbit> robertmaxrees: e.stopPropagation did not work
[09:33:14] <robertmaxrees> e.stopPropagation();
[09:33:17] <robertmaxrees> you need the ()
[09:33:27] <testerbit> Yes, I included it
[09:33:49] <robertmaxrees> try e.stopImmediatePropagation();
[09:33:54] <robertmaxrees> if that doesn't work, make a fiddle.
[09:34:38] <testerbit> what is the difference between stopImmediate?
[09:35:14] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/event.stopimmediatepropagation/
[09:36:25] <sillyslux> <robertmaxrees> don't use onclick=
[09:36:35] <sillyslux> but.. addEventListener instead?
[09:36:42] <robertmaxrees> if you have jquery, use .on()
[09:36:44] <robertmaxrees> sillyslux
[09:36:53] <sillyslux> ok
[09:37:06] <sillyslux> w/o it would be addEventListener, right?
[09:37:15] <sillyslux> w/p jquery
[09:37:32] <robertmaxrees> without jquery, correct.
[09:37:41] <sillyslux> thx :)
[09:41:34] <robertmaxrees> mcfdez87 you want something more like http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/vmmf5o3L/2/
[09:41:55] <robertmaxrees> however,m that doesn't work because .html() replaces the html() contents of the tag, which doesn't work with images.
[09:42:22] <robertmaxrees> so you want this: http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/vmmf5o3L/3/
[09:42:36] <mcfdez87> thanks robertmaxrees
[09:45:16] <Tennis>  hey has anyone experience 2 users with the same internet explorer version
[09:45:16] <Tennis> <Tennis> 1 has garbled elements
[09:45:16] <Tennis> <Tennis> the other is perfectly functional
[09:45:16] <Tennis> <Tennis> ?
[09:45:19] <vivekananda> what architecture or codebase do I use to retrieve , create visual dropdown and show it quickly. Currently my jquery is straighforward but takes a long time ( 5 -seconds + ) retrieving and appending + showing . ( database as 60k entries)
[09:45:43] <Tennis> also it might be jquery/javascript related so nobody beat me with a stick please
[09:47:15] <snover> Tennis: what does ‚Äúgarbled‚Äù mean
[09:47:26] <snover> just based on that word it sounds like there is a video driver problem
[09:51:05] <robertmaxrees> vivekananda that's better suited to #web or a channel about your particular backend language.
[09:51:30] <vivekananda> hmm okay
[09:51:49] <robertmaxrees> if you hit the url diorectly, does it still take 5 seconds?
[09:51:55] <robertmaxrees> or only when you call it with ajax?
[09:54:22] <vivekananda> I didn't understand the question completely but from what I understand. ajax --call--> x.php ( get data and do stuff) --return data--> frontend ( change color + append data to ul  as <li> elements) then show it
[09:54:48] <robertmaxrees> vivekananda right.  so you're calling a URL with ajax.
[09:55:04] <robertmaxrees> you should try taking that URL and hitting it directly with a browser or other tool.
[09:56:34] <vivekananda> oo okay
[09:56:42] <vivekananda> will try that and get back
[09:58:15] <Tennis> snover, like muddled up , jumbled, jargon ... skewed ugly broken
[09:58:43] <robertmaxrees> Tennis it's hard for us to understand what you mean when you say that.  can you provide screenshots or anything?
[09:58:55] <Tennis> I could do
[09:59:17] <Tennis> and I'm very grateful for the offer to take a look. my manager has since left
[09:59:26] <Tennis> so i will pick it up on tuesday :)
[09:59:33] <Tennis> enjoy your long weekend guiz
[09:59:43] <robertmaxrees> i don't get a long weekend :(
[09:59:51] <decx> what you dont have pfingsten
[09:59:54] <randomguy1> i'm taking a vaca
[09:59:56] <decx> savages
[10:00:07] <robertmaxrees> decx++
[10:00:14] <robertmaxrees> because we're all from the US here rite?
[10:01:02] <adv_> i'm looking for a plugin that does a smooth animation to swap two rectangular areas. anyone has seen something like this?
[10:01:42] <robertmaxrees> could you define "swap"?
[10:02:49] <decx> i forgot what the lib was called that animated between elements
[10:07:11] <adv_> robertmaxrees: one take the place of the other
[10:07:24] <robertmaxrees> lol right - what part of that is animated?
[10:07:31] <robertmaxrees> they just slide?
[10:08:17] <adv_> well what i want optimally is something like the skype effect. that you click on the thumbnail of the peer and it switches to full size
[10:09:16] <Uhkis> skype effect?
[10:09:35] <robertmaxrees> yeah - click a picture and it "maximises" with an animation.
[10:10:37] <Uhkis> so we're talking about basic height width animation?
[10:10:49] <robertmaxrees> basically, yeah.
[10:11:23] <robertmaxrees> there is a plugin that did EXACTLY that but I can't remember what it was now.
[10:11:38] <adv_> robertmaxrees: ah...:(
[10:12:45] <Uhkis> http://jsfiddle.net/r9nsbyj7/ like this? :D
[10:14:07] <adv_> Uhkis: lol yeah but somewhat more polished
[10:18:43] <vivekananda> wow.js has interesting things . not sure if maximizing is there but it does other stuff
[10:19:19] <robertmaxrees> that's for scrolling i though.
[10:19:21] <robertmaxrees> *thought
[10:19:41] <vivekananda> yeah but can set timers and stuff in there
[10:19:51] <vivekananda> might be useful.
[10:22:42] <cordovafan8> Hi, I have a general question. If i'm using vanilla jquery and doing an ajax request in my document.ready, why might the class styles be ignored in any .html() I build from the ajax data?
[10:23:06] <robertmaxrees> they aren't.
[10:23:11] <robertmaxrees> unless you don't have the CSS included.
[10:24:03] <cordovafan8> so basically if I do: ' content = '<div class="blah">' + data['item'] + '</div>'; $('#divname').html(content);' the class 'blah' should be applied?
[10:24:13] <robertmaxrees> yes.
[10:24:28] <cordovafan8> that's what I thought
[10:24:33] <testerbit> robertmaxrees: e.stopPropagation does work, however it blocks the functionality of another modal closing, is there a way to wait until the other modal closed to open the other?
[10:24:50] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[10:27:25] <cordovafan8> robertmaxrees: ok you are going to laugh... I accidentally had closing tags leftover (<div class="blah"></div> + content + </div>) .... so obviously it wasn't styling
[10:29:23] <robertmaxrees> hah.  there you go :)
[10:41:31] <testerbit> Why is the verify_request_success_modal not opening (or being closed quickly) in firefox? http://pastebin.com/Nc8guvuD
[10:42:32] <hover> Can someone help me figure out why this doesn't work?
[10:42:41] <hover> https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/bZXFB7iJ
[11:10:00] <randomguy1> hover: what is not working?
[11:10:23] <hover> randomguy1: It won't apply the attribute to the link
[11:11:00] <randomguy1> hover: http://jsfiddle.net/nejxgj75/  inspecting the link, the id appears to be there
[11:14:05] <hover> randomguy1: Safari wasn't refreshing properly for some reason. Do you know how I can add data attributes?
[11:14:28] <randomguy1> $(selector).data('key', 'value')
[11:17:28] <hover> randomguy1: what am I doing wrong here? http://jsfiddle.net/nejxgj75/1/
[11:19:16] <randomguy1> hover: i'm not entirely sure you can do multiple at one time. one sec
[11:22:41] <hover> randomguy1: thanks
[11:26:14] <randomguy1> hover: http://jsfiddle.net/nejxgj75/3/
[11:28:01] <hover> randomguy1: thanks let me try this out
[11:31:18] <hover> randomguy1 just messaged you
[11:31:32] <randomguy1> yup
[11:41:53] <randomguy1> still there testerbit?
[11:42:17] <testerbit> randomguy1 yes
[11:42:25] <mcfdez87> Anyone can help me with this code? I get an error that $ is not defined and I don't understand why http://jsfiddle.net/sttt24e9/1/
[11:42:38] <mcfdez87> I call this code after to call jquery
[11:42:46] <randomguy1> did you try putting a console log before the checkedValues.length to see what the length is?
[11:43:19] <testerbit> no I just added this: $('#verify_request_success_modal').on('click', '.btn', function(){
[11:43:21] <testerbit> works now
[11:43:31] <randomguy1> mcfdez87: is fancybox a plugin?
[11:43:31] <testerbit> before    if(activeBanks.length){
[11:43:43] <randomguy1> testerbit: ah, cool
[11:44:01] <mcfdez87> randomguy1, yes, I call it in the html, after jquery and before the code
[11:44:59] <randomguy1> mcfdez87: could you attach a reference to it on the jsfiddle so it's not undefined?
[11:45:15] <randomguy1> mcfdez87: under "external resources"
[11:45:32] <Woet> mcfdez87: "$ is not defined" does not show up on your jsfiddle.
[11:50:24] <mcfdez87> randomguy1, Woet http://jsfiddle.net/sttt24e9/4/
[11:50:31] <mcfdez87> this is exactly what I have
[11:50:47] <Woet> mcfdez87: still no "$ is not defined"
[11:51:16] <mcfdez87> Woet, shows $() fancybox error
[11:51:17] <Woet> mcfdez87: why don't you load the JS in the same way as on your website?
[11:51:26] <Woet> mcfdez87: yes, that's not the error you said you were getting.
[11:52:18] <Woet> mcfdez87: and before that it also shows another error, you might want to fix that first.
[11:52:18] <mcfdez87> In my web, If I quit the fancybox references, the error goes to the next function,  goes to $.scrolline
[11:54:47] <mcfdez87> Woet, I deleted fancybox reference and the resouce that shows the first error and now yes I get the first said error http://jsfiddle.net/sttt24e9/7/
[11:56:23] <Woet> mcfdez87: okay, now look at the line that's causing the error
[11:56:50] <Woet> a few lines above it you're redefining $
[11:57:08] <Woet> and assigning jQuery to $mcj for some reason
[12:03:58] <mcfdez87> Woet, yes, I deleted these lines and works
[12:04:10] <Woet> mcfdez87: so why did you add them in the first place?
[12:04:43] <mcfdez87> I don't know what mens  these lines, I a collaborative code, I need to ask to other developers
[12:05:02] <randomguy1> good times
[12:05:34] <randomguy1> things like that, it's helpful to have in a self documenting function, ;)
[12:30:10] <ZeuZ> Got a dumb question but here goes anyways: http://codepad.org/OMGLGQS5 ---> why doesn-t the scope of the first "datos" variable reaches the always() function?
[12:31:52] <randomguy1> you don't get the alert?
[12:32:32] <ZeuZ> I do get the alert, but I had previously an alert after that, near the fadeouts, and datos seems to be blank
[12:33:03] <randomguy1> ajax calls are asynchronous.  by the time it gets to the bottom html(datos) the ajax call is not finished
[12:33:18] <randomguy1> you'll want to move that into you always probably
[12:33:33] <ZeuZ> ah, Ok thanks
[12:33:59] <randomguy1> then you don't need your global var :)
[12:44:20] <gtristan> I have a hand full of specific nodes, and I need to walk them in a treeish order
[12:44:50] <gtristan> from the root node to children, not direct children but .closest() matches
[12:45:13] <gtristan> probably some way to do this in jquery elegantly
[12:45:57] <gtristan> as opposed to maintaining a JS object tree by hand, every time an object is added/removed from that pool
[12:46:48] <gtristan> $([ array of nodes]).fancy().chain().each(function (child) { voila ! });
[12:48:05] <randomguy1> are these structured like dom elements?
[12:49:06] <gtristan> well, the important part is that there is a DOM element for each item in the pool (they are in fact drop zones for drag and drop)
[12:49:29] <gtristan> drop zones can be active or not, when they are, depending on the drag data, then need to be traversed
[12:49:56] <gtristan> so they're in a pool, this pool I could make a fancy JS tree and update the tree every time
[12:50:15] <gtristan> but the only important thing is, when I handle an event, I want to handle parents first
[12:50:31] <gtristan> and not handle nodes that are children if the pointer is outside the parent + margin
[12:50:57] <gtristan> so something like a nested .each ()
[12:51:02] <gtristan> I guess
[12:51:55] <gtristan> using something like .closest() to ensure one-level-depth iteration for each child .each() invocation
[12:52:15] <randomguy1> you can use a finder of ('> something') to only search one level deep
[12:52:25] <gtristan> toplevel needs to ensure that it only traverses nodes which are not inside any of the others
[12:52:43] <gtristan> yeah but thats not a level in my terms ;-)
[12:53:06] <gtristan> there can be as many as you like between an active parent drop zone and an active child drop zone
[12:53:13] <gtristan> they are just nodes in an Array
[12:54:03] <randomguy1> define 'node'.  raw js element?
[12:54:20] <gtristan> so for each node, a child is in context, and we want to iterate over all the closest children in the same array of the given child
[12:54:44] <gtristan> randomguy1, no, a JS Array of HTMLElement nodes
[12:54:55] <randomguy1> there we go! :D
[12:55:46] <gtristan> there, that will reduce the amount of times per mouse event I calculate the mouse position relative to some element by like 100 times :)
[12:57:41] <randomguy1> ok, so you want to know a child's siblings?
[13:02:02] <randomguy1> and i'm out for the weekend!  whoo hoo!  happy holiday everyone, if your american.  and gtristan: may not be useful for you but https://api.jquery.com/siblings/ If not, sorry, :(  others in room may offer more help
[13:02:28] <decx> i cant even visualize what's going on
[13:02:54] <decx> why resort to traversing if you already do the right thing and build the tree yourself if you want to increase performance
[13:04:29] <gtristan> decx, nah I didnt build the tree myself ;-)
[13:04:57] <decx> what's this for anyway
[13:05:12] <decx> sounds like an inventory system
[13:05:21] <gtristan> I currently have an Array of the active drop zones, and was pondering whether to build the tree or if I could get away with a quick and dirty query
[13:05:41] <decx> you dont want to query if you do stuff on mousemove
[13:05:56] <gtristan> good point, I'll just build the tree then
[13:06:20] <gtristan> however I thought maybe using .closest() to check the ancestry would be pretty quick
[13:06:31] <gtristan> (can always tell if one node is a child of the other)
[13:07:08] <gtristan> would potentially reduce some 50 lines of code to like, 3 or 4 ;-)
[13:07:27] <decx> cant tell without some meat on that theoretic convolution i made up from reading all your lines
[13:10:53] <gtristan> heh
[13:11:24] <gtristan> decx, in any case, I think we can both agree that building the tree manually is the optimal choice
[13:12:15] <gtristan> in the time I could spend analyzing just how much I lose by calculating that, I could just be writing it so...
[13:38:42] <Stalkr_> Can jQuery Ajax read binary files, such as images? Can't find anything
[13:39:02] <Woet> what are you trying to achieve?
[13:40:35] <Stalkr_> Woet: I have an array of images, I'll need to send a GET for each, receive some blob/arraybuffer, throw it into a zip and save it
[13:41:19] <Woet> does http://stuk.github.io/jszip/ help?
[13:41:42] <Stalkr_> Woet: Yes, I'm using that with FileSaver.js
[13:41:44] <Woet> or do you actually have to manipulate the images?
[13:41:52] <Stalkr_> but my problem is the GET request
[14:42:32] <testerbit> I have check boxes inside a modal window, what is a simple way to store the state of the checkboxes so when the page is revised the state is saved?
[14:42:50] <robertmaxrees> ajax them to your backend for ultimate longevity.
[14:42:54] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, localstorage.
[14:45:16] <testerbit> robertmaxrees: do you have a simple example of local storage?
[14:45:47] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Storage_API/Using_the_Web_Storage_API
[14:45:58] <robertmaxrees> has examples.
[14:48:50] <testerbit> thanks
[15:10:35] <gtristan> to check if one HTMLElement node is somewhere within another, I do: isChild = ($(node).closest (ancestor) >= 1);
[15:10:43] <gtristan> is that not correct ? ^^^^^
[15:10:46] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[15:11:05] <gtristan> oh, what am I missing ?
[15:11:06] <robertmaxrees> .length
[15:11:31] <gtristan> closest (ancestor).length >= 1 ?
[15:11:34] <robertmaxrees> $(node).closest(ancestor).lenght === 1
[15:11:34] * gtristan palmface
[15:11:50] <gtristan> === 1 even better yeah
[15:12:18] <shoky> there's also
[15:12:22] <shoky> `api $.contains
[15:12:22] <b-ot> shoky: No matches.
[15:12:26] <shoky> `api jQuery.contains
[15:12:27] <b-ot> shoky: jQuery.contains(): Check to see if a DOM element is within another DOM element. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.contains/
[15:19:43] <robertmaxrees> that flips the whole thing around, but yeah
[17:21:24] <teza19> Is there a way to set a JSON asynchronous query to false?
[17:40:45] <robertmaxrees> JSONP?
[17:40:50] <robertmaxrees> or just any JSON?
[17:52:43] <monk3y> Got an Ajax/JSON return-handling issue.  Here's a PasteBin, which is clumsy, 'cause it's the text of the Chrome console, then the JS attempting to access it.  http://pastebin.com/m5NEAgEx
[17:54:56] <monk3y> From Googling, could it just need a good JSON.parse()?
[18:06:01] <shoky> monk3y: how about some code, and a non clumsy log?
[18:07:18] <decx> i was thinking "how can a log be clumsy?" but it succeeds in being just that
[18:08:44] <shoky> who's gonna take it upon themselves to make a log-unclumsifier service
[18:13:48] <monk3y> shoky: heh I'm usually a stickler for specifics, but in this case I was hoping the Chrome console output and the JS line to access it might have shown a simple oversight.  I'm guessing not.
[18:15:08] <monk3y> Sorry gents.  There's a few layers contributing to this code (jQuery, DataTable, another 3rd party 'Datatable', etc), so showing all layers would take some time.
[18:59:19] <_1_james> hey
[19:31:54] <daviorocha> hi, I have an iframe pointing to my own domain but $('#iframe').resize() is not firing, anyone know why? the $('#iframe').load() works and resizes the iframe, when an ajax call is made it not resizes, but if I call the function  from console it works.
