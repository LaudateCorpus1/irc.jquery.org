[08:27:38] <diverdude> hi, I need help doing a CSS task( I can pay if need be). I have the following setup: https://jsfiddle.net/79o8f5px/5/   This works ok, but my problem here is that the surrounding frame under 2) is not square. It should always be square and the 2 frames should always have same size regardless of windowsize(responsive design). Also, if i change the number of the grid cells either horizontally or vertically it should always remain square. Its the boxes
[08:27:38] <diverdude> inside the frame which needs to change aspect ratio when the number of boxes in either direction changes. Is there anyone who can implement this for me? (I will of course pay you for your work - just give me estimated price first)
[08:42:46] <undefined_bob> this is the jquery channel
[13:00:10] <z1haze> what would a selector be inside a change event for a checkbox, where i want to find a 'hidden' input by the same name as $(this) in the form
[13:00:25] <z1haze> can you apply multiple [] filters like that?
[13:00:46] <robertmaxrees> you can, but i'd favor using a .filter instead.
[13:00:57] <z1haze> $form.find('[type=hidden][name='+$(this).attr('name')]') ?
[13:01:06] <robertmaxrees> that's one way, but I would avoid doing that.
[13:01:13] <z1haze> how would the filter look
[13:01:56] <z1haze> like return $(this).attr('name') === 'something' && $(this).attr('type') === 'hidden' type deal?
[13:02:00] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[13:02:05] <robertmaxrees> exactly that
[13:02:17] <z1haze> may I ask why youd think this is better over the alternative
[13:02:45] <robertmaxrees> people constantly try to cram way too much into the selector, which isn't really very performant or readable.
[13:03:02] <z1haze> ah ok
[13:03:46] <z1haze> yeah, definitely less readable the other way i can see that
[13:03:51] <robertmaxrees> :)
[14:08:30] <diverdude> I need help w. the following task(https://i.ibb.co/RTHPycy/Screen-Shot-2019-04-30-at-20-04-38.png)  I can pay for it. Please PM me
[14:13:46] <robertmaxrees> wrong place to ask for that diverdude
[14:14:07] <diverdude> robertmaxrees: ok - no web developers in here?
[14:14:17] <robertmaxrees> it's a support channel for jquery.
[14:14:23] <robertmaxrees> not a channel for finding freelance devs.
[16:15:55] <z1haze> diverdude, if you pay someone to do your homework, how are you going to learn it
[16:16:06] <robertmaxrees> lol
[16:16:37] <diverdude> *sigh*
[16:16:44] <robertmaxrees> moving on
[16:16:44] <diverdude> its not homework
[16:16:58] <z1haze> how much you payin
[16:17:09] <robertmaxrees> z1haze okay okay - drop the subject and move on.
[16:17:10] <robertmaxrees> thank
[16:17:12] <robertmaxrees> *thanks
[16:17:13] <z1haze> hahaha
[16:17:21] <z1haze> cmon man, its dead in here today
[16:17:29] <robertmaxrees> don't care :)
[16:17:33] <z1haze> just trying to lighten it up
[16:17:42] <robertmaxrees> Lshrug:
[16:44:32] <Jasein> why does jquery return the value for "font-size" in pixels including the units. i.e. rather than 28.47 it returns 28.47px   What other values are returned like this in jquery?
[16:45:01] <robertmaxrees> some css ones are Jasein
[16:45:13] <Jasein> Where might I find which ones?
[16:45:19] <robertmaxrees> https://api.jquery.com/ :)
[16:45:43] <Jasein> right. thanks.
