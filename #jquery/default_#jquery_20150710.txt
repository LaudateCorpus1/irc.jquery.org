[00:03:05] <hellyeah> i guess i couldnt tell what problem is
[00:03:12] <hellyeah> function works only once
[00:05:45] <hellyeah> is it because of document.on
[00:05:46] <hellyeah> ?
[00:05:51] <Crucials> nope
[00:07:50] <hellyeah> did you understand what i try to tell?
[00:07:58] <hellyeah> my english is not really good
[00:08:37] <Crucials> i understand but the issue with this example is that there are several bad practices which make it very difficult
[00:09:08] <Crucials> for example, you are trying to choose a row based on if its orange
[00:09:24] <Crucials> but then you are changing it from orange and still want to differentiate it in the same way
[00:09:37] <Crucials> ideally you would have a better way to refer to it, such as a class called "orange" maybe
[00:10:59] <Crucials> and you also wouldnt want to use inline styling at all, because that overrides all the changes you are trying to do in your css
[00:11:04] <hellyeah> actually when user click the checkbox it will see some animations and when it is uncheck it returns to orange
[00:11:23] <hellyeah> Crucials:  html codde is automatically generated by asp.net
[00:11:31] <hellyeah> i dont have any interferences.
[00:15:52] <Crucials> well i hate to hackfix like this but
[00:15:59] <Crucials> this will probably serve you better
[00:16:00] <Crucials> http://jsfiddle.net/o80o56yu/31/
[00:16:18] <Crucials> if finds everything that is orange and gives it the class "orange" at the start
[00:16:23] <Crucials> and also removes any inline styling
[00:16:35] <Crucials> and then simply toggles a class called "darken" on change
[00:16:39] <hellyeah> i cant remove inline styling unfortunately
[00:16:46] <Crucials> so the coloring is handled by css
[00:16:52] <hellyeah> becase it is automatically generated
[00:17:03] <hellyeah> asp.net has gridview
[00:17:09] <Crucials> well this removes it using script
[00:17:11] <hellyeah> you cannot use html tag directly
[00:17:29] <hellyeah> removing from script is okey i guess
[00:17:34] <hellyeah> that what i try to do
[00:18:46] <Crucials> this way you are adding darken to all the rows, you could also just check if the row has the class orange before adding that if you only need that
[00:20:05] <hellyeah> thats nice
[00:20:54] <hellyeah> you meantion here .orange.darken darks belongs to orange class or darken is child of orange
[00:21:20] <Crucials> if there is no space between them, then it means it has both classes "orange" and "darken"
[00:54:02] <Kartagis> http://jsfiddle.net/kartagis/hv3vzkf6/2/ <--- why isn't this toggling? or do I need to fadeIn then fadeOut?
[00:54:20] <Kartagis> bioogir is a spammer
[00:55:00] <hellyeah> you  should report to stuff in #freenode
[00:56:06] <Kartagis> staff*
[00:56:32] <Crucials> Kartagis is it meant to just fade away after 2 seconds?
[00:56:44] <hellyeah> staf right
[00:57:12] <Kartagis> Crucials: fadein then fadeout
[00:58:20] <Crucials> im not sure thats how fadetoggle works
[00:59:09] <Kartagis> http://api.jquery.com/fadeToggle/ <--- click on first button at the bottom
[00:59:17] <Kartagis> Crucials: ^
[00:59:38] <Crucials> right
[00:59:44] <Crucials> so it either fades in or fades out
[00:59:50] <Crucials> depending on if its visible or not
[01:00:09] <Kartagis> aye
[01:01:11] <Crucials> so, its doing that
[01:01:15] <Crucials> right now, no?
[01:01:42] <Kartagis> is it?
[01:01:54] <Crucials> well, its fading out after 2 seconds
[01:01:58] <Crucials> because its visible to begin with
[01:02:11] <Kartagis> but it's not fading in
[01:03:12] <Crucials> right because thats not how fade toggle works :P
[01:03:29] <Crucials> what exactly do you expect should happen? fade in - wait 2 seconds - fade out?
[01:04:00] <Kartagis> aye
[01:04:11] <Kartagis> the button does exactly that
[01:04:34] <Crucials> no it doesnt
[01:04:45] <Crucials> that button in the jquery api page just fades out
[01:04:50] <Crucials> and then fades back in if you click it again
[01:05:39] <Kartagis> then in this case, I have to fadeIn then fadeOut
[01:08:02] <Crucials> probably something like this http://jsfiddle.net/hv3vzkf6/3/
[01:10:11] <anom> if ( $(this).find('.overlay').hasClass('hide') ) - how would I do this so instead of hasClass, it's has NOT class?
[01:11:03] <Cork> if ( !$(this).find('.overlay').hasClass('hide') )
[01:14:29] <anom> https://jsbin.com/zejunovizu/edit?html,css,js,output i need to the first two .test div's to match.
[01:17:22] <anom> * I want to add the .noscroll class to the first two .test divs.
[01:17:57] <Cork> anom: your data is incomplete (most likely cause your using jsbin, don't)
[01:18:17] <Cork> use jsfiddle or another site that let you manually save the changes
[01:18:30] <Crucials> wow did that thing just reversed my attempt
[01:19:55] <Cork> Crucials: is jsbin it's built to lose changes
[01:20:05] <Cork> and why i never touch them
[01:20:08] <Crucials> upsetting
[01:20:19] <anom> https://jsfiddle.net/nk1n3x1t/
[01:20:37] <anom> I like jsbin because i haven't got to hit run on every update
[01:20:42] <anom> only reason I use it
[01:21:57] <Cork> anom: https://jsfiddle.net/nk1n3x1t/1/
[01:22:31] <Kartagis> anom: just hit ctrl+enter dude, it isn't that hard
[01:22:57] <Crucials> or ctrl+S and have to close the save popup
[01:22:58] <Crucials> repeatedly
[01:24:01] <Kartagis> Crucials: your jquery and mine were identical and I wondered why mine wasn't fading in, until I realised you added a display:none
[01:24:03] <Kartagis> heh
[01:24:13] <Crucials> ah yeah, sorry
[01:24:27] <Crucials> well if you swapped them both to fadeToggle
[01:24:43] <Crucials> then you would be able to see what it does :P
[01:25:58] <Kartagis> fadeToggle should be able too fadeIn, then fadeOut, IMHO
[01:26:08] <Kartagis> able to*
[01:29:28] <Crucials> Cork how about $('.test:lt(2)').addClass
[01:30:13] <Cork> Crucials: except that won't actually do what he asked for
[01:30:31] <anom> Thanks cork
[01:30:34] <Cork> it will statically add the class, it won't base it on what is in the dom
[01:30:59] <Crucials> i must have missed the problem, i thought it was just the first two "test" classes
[01:31:41] <Cork> Crucials: the point was to check for the test with a child that has .overlay but doesn't have .hide
[01:31:53] <Cork> and set noscroll on those
[01:32:28] <Crucials> right, didnt see that at all
[02:08:32] <lintguy> Hallo
[02:10:10] <lintguy> I'm running an each on img elements and if i do console.log($(this)) i get a list of properties, i can see the url on currentSrc and on src but if i do console.log($(this).prop('src') i get nothing. It's the same with console.log($(this).prop('currentSrc'). I've never had this issue before and it's quite a large app, anyone have any clue as to why this can occur?
[02:11:45] <lintguy> Cork: Maybe you are here and can shed some light on this?
[02:22:30] <Crucials> lintguy can you recreate it in a fiddle? seems to work fine for me
[02:23:09] <lintguy> Crucials: I can't unfortunately, it's a large app
[02:23:24] <lintguy> It's probably a cornercase of sorts
[02:23:53] <Crucials> try this.src?
[02:23:53] <lintguy> I'm using it in a slider named swiper
[02:24:03] <Crucials> or $(this)[].src
[02:24:07] <Crucials> [0]
[02:25:05] <ganeshaditya1> Hey I am making this hobby project and I am using 5 ~ 6 jquery libraries, widgets etc., and a couple of css files for these things. I was wondering if there is a way I could factor out all these imports? If I ever rename a JS file or a CSS file I would have to change the import statements in allll my files which would be tedious!
[02:25:09] <lintguy> Crucials: None of them worked
[02:26:21] <Crucials> sure the image element's src is set in the html?
[02:27:00] <Cork> lintguy: could you reproduce it in a jsfiddle?
[02:27:25] <Cork> it might be a widget class you're looking at and not a simple jquery object
[02:27:26] <lintguy> Crucials: Yes, it's in the dom
[02:27:42] <lintguy> Cork: That's what i'm suspecting
[02:28:03] <lintguy> What i'm tying to do is add unique urls to the images in the slider after it has initiated
[02:28:29] <Cork> reproduce it in a fiddle and it would make it much simpler to help you
[02:28:41] <lintguy> Cork: Ok, i'll try that
[02:28:43] <lintguy> Thanks
[02:31:30] <lintguy> Hm, that's odd
[02:31:54] <lintguy> If i destroy the slider, then initiate it again and then in the console run .each on the images - it works fine.
[02:32:25] <lintguy> So it must be related to the scope of the function where i have the .each
[02:35:55] <lintguy> Hm, nope, didn't matter if i ran it in the global scope even
[02:37:00] <javalover> hey guys i'm making a mobile website wanted to hear some thoughts
[02:37:29] <javalover> basically I have an "open map app" button...was curious should I give the user the option to open the map in browser or just automatically open it using the map app on the phone?
[02:38:16] <Tennis> map app in the phone sounds better IMO as a users perspective
[02:38:41] <javalover> so like you click it & it just opens the map app?
[02:38:44] <Tennis> browser applet within the body of the page might be to small on some devices
[02:38:45] <Tennis> yeah
[02:38:48] <javalover> or should I have a popup going "this will open map app is that okay?"
[02:39:04] <Uhkis> user preference of course
[02:39:16] <Tennis> yeah that too sounds useful
[02:39:24] <javalover> So popup good?
[02:39:39] <Tennis> just incase theyre conserving battery or have location off
[02:39:48] <Tennis> yeah I think so
[02:40:00] <javalover> I feel like a popup should be there
[02:40:20] <javalover> but I don't know if the popup should say "open in Map App" "open in browser" "cancel"
[02:40:23] <Uhkis> popup comes from the OS anyways
[02:40:30] <javalover> no on my phone it just opens...
[02:40:36] <lintguy> Cork & Crucials it was a scope issue, the swiper instance was in it's own so when i changed to that it worked fine. Thanks for the help!!
[02:41:00] <Uhkis> javalover: because you've selected "always open in app" at some point
[02:41:07] <javalover> maybe...
[02:41:15] <javalover> but i checked on a simulator & it just opened
[02:41:19] <Uhkis> also, way off topic for this channel
[02:41:25] <javalover> not really this is jquery
[02:41:30] <javalover> if anyone knows development it's you guys
[02:41:40] <Uhkis> ..
[02:41:52] <javalover> it's a development question & the feedback i've gotten so far is helpful
[02:42:14] <Uhkis> this channel is for jquery and related, not UX
[02:42:33] <javalover> where should I go to ask a UX question then?
[02:43:32] <Uhkis> dunno, maybe there's #ux
[02:44:11] <javalover> lol whatever I already got good answers
[02:44:16] <javalover> imma go with a popup with choices
[03:17:11] <tuskkk___> how do we show a waiting spinner while nested ajax calls are in progress
[03:17:31] <tuskkk___> the before send of second ajax call isnt getting triggered...
[03:27:23] <Crucials> tuskkk___ you can probably just set the spinner when you call the ajax in the first place
[03:27:32] <Crucials> and remove the spinner when you get the completed callback
[03:30:44] <tuskkk___> Crucials: am already doing that! beforeSend: Loading.show(), complete: Loading.hide(), and also have loading show in the inner ajax call
[03:31:05] <Cork> tuskkk___: no you're missing his point
[03:31:26] <Cork> Loading.show(); $.ajax().done(function() { Loading.hide() })
[03:31:38] <Crucials> yeah that
[03:37:55] <tuskkk___> Still cant figure it out, here is what I have, http://jsfiddle.net/2pjgohp2/
[03:40:10] <Crucials> tuskkk___ take the Loading.show(); outside the ajax altogether - call it before you call the ajax
[03:40:26] <Cork> tuskkk___: http://jsfiddle.net/2pjgohp2/1/
[03:40:45] <Cork> also you don't need to have it in each callback, complete is always called
[03:41:21] <Cork> also note disabled only has an effect on the submit button of the form, not the form it self
[03:41:43] <Cork> and finally  $("step3") is broken
[03:42:12] <Crucials> you probably dont want to Loading.hide() within the first ajax call, because you are following that with another one
[03:42:18] <Crucials> so probably have that in the second one only
[03:42:41] <tuskkk___> ok, noted, let me try this one now!
[03:52:51] <tuskkk___> nope, still no spinner :(
[04:17:08] <Kartagis> what's wrong with http://jsfiddle.net/kartagis/y2xfc2gg/ ?

[05:06:05] <dimi1947> when is better method to use for emptying a tag from it's HTML content....empty() or html('')
[05:06:31] <dimi1947> what is better method I mean?
[05:08:07] <Cork> dimi1947: they both run the same function
[05:08:26] <Cork> empty is better for readability
[05:08:32] <Cork> but other then that, doesn't matter
[05:09:56] <Cork> ah, not anymore i see
[05:10:04] <Cork> well they do the same thing, but not the same code
[05:10:10] <dimi1947> thanks again for your advice
[05:20:04] <notchris> morning
[05:24:40] <dan_j> Hi. I'm making a simple jquery page which allows a user to log in and perform some actions. If they refresh the page, I want to bring them back to the same place that they were at. This will involve hiding some DIVs and revealing the DIV they were using.
[05:24:50] <dan_j> How is this best accomplished?
[05:25:15] <Cork> dan_j: there is several ways
[05:25:23] <dan_j> Setting and reading the URL putting the current DIV name in the querystring?
[05:25:36] <Cork> you could store the data in the url, or you could push it and store it on server side
[05:25:41] <Cork> or you could store it locally
[05:26:00] <Cork> the last solution would break if they switched computer
[05:26:20] <dan_j> Then use javascript to hide/show the relevant items?
[05:26:43] <Cork> depends on the picked solution
[05:26:54] <dan_j> Locally is fine.
[05:27:04] <Cork> then ya
[05:27:22] <dan_j> It's a static html files, with jquery and ajax
[05:27:25] <Cork> though note if you plan to store more then very few values you shouldn't use localstorage
[05:27:45] <Cork> indexedDB is a better choice in those cases
[05:27:48] <dan_j> I basically just want to ensure they dont have to re-login if they refresh
[05:28:03] <Cork> relogin to what?
[05:28:10] <Cork> if it is static html...
[05:28:42] <Cork> cause you shouldn't store user credentials in the storage databases
[05:30:47] <nodist> dan_j what kind of server are you using and are you using php,python etc?
[05:35:27] <dan_j> Windows. Supports ASP. ASP.net and maybe PHP but I'm not a PHP guy.
[05:35:39] <hellyeah> asp.net sucks
[05:36:16] <nodist> I don't know anything about asp, but I wold assume it has sessions similar to php?
[05:37:22] <nodist> and as far as I know windows iis7 has php support, but i has to be enabled
[05:45:09] <dan_j> Yes, it supports sessions and can store details on the server side in a session. I'm just thinking from a jquery point of view, the page will load with the homepage showing, and once Ready is executed it will read the current state, and take the user back to where they were. It's not really that smooth.
[05:46:40] <dan_j> I'm using CSS to hide the other screens until they log in. If I want them to be taken back to the screen they were on, I will have to either manipulate the CSS that they receive, or jquery will need to do it (but can it be done before the user sees anything)?
[05:47:23] <dan_j> MODERATORS: bioogir is spamming the channel with private messages and a random URL.
[05:47:47] <Cork> dan_j: sure it can
[05:47:59] <Cork> if the server knows about it it can modify what is rendered
[05:50:22] <dan_j> Ok. Thanks for your help. I think i've got it now.
[05:58:33] <tomoyuki28jp> When I install jquery via bower, uglify fails in jquery/src/intro.js. Any idea how can I fix it?
[06:02:42] <tomoyuki28jp> Anybody?
[06:23:33] <fn> hello guys
[06:24:02] <fn> got multiple json object with same value and want to use that as key for grouping inside - any ideas?
[06:24:59] <Cork> fn: json object, or an object?
[06:25:04] <Cork> (meaning an object or a string)
[06:25:45] <Cork> fn: if it is an object you could use Object.values(obj)
[06:25:56] <Cork> if it is a json object you would have to parse it first
[06:26:26] <fn> http://pastie.org/10284433
[06:26:41] <Cork> that doesn't say
[06:26:50] <fn> all I have is this :D
[06:26:53] <Cork> it could be json or it could be javascript
[06:27:09] <Cork> where you use it and how you get it defines that
[06:27:09] <fn> currently it's saved as data.json
[06:27:19] <Cork> and fetched through ajax?
[06:27:23] <fn> yes
[06:27:32] <Cork> is the server sending the correct content type?
[06:27:38] <Cork> (application/json)
[06:27:38] <fn> yes
[06:27:44] <Cork> ok
[06:27:58] <fn> and all I want is grouping by "type"
[06:28:01] <Cork> and you want to group them by type?
[06:28:03] <Cork> heh ok
[06:28:07] <fn> hehe yes
[06:29:37] <fn> what I want to get is apple->devicename->price/other attr.
[06:29:41] <Cork> what do you want in the grouped result?
[06:29:53] <Cork> ah
[06:33:37] <Cork> fn: http://jsfiddle.net/qxqon5sg/
[06:35:11] <fn> thanks
[06:41:32] <fn> Cork: can I use jquery getjson for this?
[06:41:48] <Cork> fn: sure, or $.ajax
[06:41:51] <Cork> or $.get
[06:42:02] <Cork> doesn't really matter as long as the server is configured correctly
[06:42:33] <javalover> Tennis!!
[06:42:44] <javalover> Tennis idk if you're still in here but I finally got done coding my menu and it is PERFECTTT
[06:43:00] <javalover> I just wanted to say thank you for your input, as it inspired me to go through with it, and i'm super thrilled with the results!!
[06:43:13] <fn> Cork: hm it's localhost currently.
[06:43:24] <fn> how do I access to "Price" now? O.o
[06:43:30] <javalover> Tennis: Thank You For Feedback much appreciated :D you're probably sleeping lol
[06:44:03] <javalover> fn: are you enjoying coding ?
[06:44:03] <Cork> fn: groupedData.Apple["long string"].price
[06:44:28] <fn> thx
[06:44:45] <javalover> idk man something about when you get something done right leaves you with this feeling of euphoria so I really hope both Cork & fn and anyone else coding is having a great day :D
[06:44:59] <fn> haha
[06:45:23] <javalover> i think it's just been bugging me like all week
[06:45:31] <javalover> so to finally get it done it's like awwww peace finally
[06:45:46] <fn> Cork: maybe there is an issue :/
[06:45:57] <javalover> what's the problem fn?
[06:46:01] <javalover> maybe I can help
[06:46:26] <fn> console.log(groupedData.Apple["Apple iPhone 4 8GB"].price);
[06:46:32] <fn> should output 449, right?
[06:46:41] <javalover> not necessarily
[06:46:49] <javalover> can you log the object itself?
[06:46:58] <javalover> and click through the objects properties to see what is showing up?
[06:47:11] <Cork> fn: ya, it doesn't work, not sure what happened
[06:47:13] <Cork> give me a min
[06:47:26] <javalover> oh is this a duo project?
[06:47:35] <fn> nope ^^
[06:47:38] <fn> he's helping meh
[06:47:41] <fn> -h
[06:47:45] <javalover> are you jsoning it up?
[06:48:02] <fn> http://jsfiddle.net/qxqon5sg/
[06:48:08] <fn> thats waht he made
[06:48:39] <javalover> but that's not even json yet well i mean
[06:48:43] <javalover> it's a test version of json
[06:48:58] <fn> but it should work with it?
[06:49:13] <javalover> idk what the || {} part means
[06:49:22] <javalover> but uhhh
[06:49:29] <Uhkis> "or empty object"
[06:49:33] <javalover> i also don't get this
[06:49:42] <javalover> groupedData[this.type][this.device]
[06:49:54] <javalover> but maybe sort methods exist
[06:50:42] <javalover> idk it looks normal though
[06:50:49] <javalover> just some weird stuff in it that i'm not understanding
[06:50:53] <javalover> are you like trying to sort the json data?
[06:51:27] <fn> nope
[06:51:32] <fn> i try to grouping
[06:51:34] <javalover> what's the goal then?
[06:52:56] <Cork> fn: http://jsfiddle.net/qxqon5sg/1/
[06:53:25] <Cork> appears $.grep only works on arrays :/
[06:53:48] <javalover> ohhhhhhhhhhh
[06:53:49] <javalover> haha
[06:54:26] <javalover> Cork why this part?
[06:54:32] <javalover>     groupedData[this.type][this.device] = info
[06:54:36] <javalover> what's that all about?
[06:54:46] <Cork> uh.. try removing it
[06:54:55] <javalover> no but like what's that for?
[06:54:56] <javalover> lol
[06:55:02] <fn> thanks a lot
[06:56:34] <javalover> meh guess it works i've just never seen that before
[06:57:54] <javalover> ohhh wait
[06:58:06] <javalover> are you sorting the 3 into type[array];
[06:58:18] <Uhkis> it's a basic multidimensional array
[06:58:22] <javalover> i seee
[06:58:24] <javalover> sooo this
[06:58:25] <Cork> no it isn't
[06:58:35] <Cork> it is a multi dimentional object
[06:58:47] <Cork> or a nested object as it is normally called
[06:58:53] <javalover>     groupedData[this.type][this.device] = info   means like groupedData.Apple["device value here"] = price.
[06:59:02] <javalover> sure whatever I get it
[06:59:03] <Cork> not exactly
[06:59:06] <javalover> a bit confusing but I get it
[06:59:12] <javalover> wait
[06:59:14] <javalover> sorry
[06:59:16] <Cork> info is the filtered object created wit hthe each a bit up
[06:59:27] <Cork> wit==with
[06:59:32] <javalover> groupedData.Apple["device value here"] = Array containing price
[06:59:38] <Cork> no
[06:59:40] <Cork> there is no arrays
[06:59:47] <javalover> well it's an object right?
[06:59:48] <javalover> sooo
[06:59:52] <javalover> Object containing price
[06:59:58] <Cork> correct
[07:00:01] <javalover> ic ic
[07:00:03] <javalover> that's ok i get it
[07:00:04] <Cork> and anything else except type and device
[07:00:06] <javalover> i was like "why the double?"
[07:00:34] <javalover> that's kinda crazy that you can assign like groupedData[this.type]  and it comes out groupedData.Apple
[07:00:53] <Cork> [] is just another way to express the dot notation
[07:00:54] <javalover> thx for explaining Cork I was fascinated by the Code :D
[07:01:00] <Cork> and you can't use variables with dot
[07:01:14] <javalover> ic
[07:01:20] <Cork> obj["key"] === obj.key
[07:01:22] <javalover> can you do this in like python?
[07:01:31] <Cork> O_o
[07:01:38] <mooncup> also object['key']
[07:01:39] <javalover> or is this just for javascript?
[07:01:39] <Cork> are you trolling?
[07:01:43] <javalover> not trolling at all
[07:01:50] <javalover> i've never assigned variables this way i'm cruious
[07:02:06] <mooncup> bioogir just sent me a cam site in a pm if there any ops around

[07:03:25] <shoky> ;p
[07:03:26] <mooncup> was just giving a headsup
[07:03:36] <decx> but +R :(
[07:03:52] <mooncup> I'm a social person by nature
[07:03:58] <mooncup> I don't wanna prevent new friends from messaging me
[07:04:23] <javalover> ok now that i've reread this I realize why you asked if I was trolling Corki
[07:05:15] <javalover> the this, was what was throwing me off but I now realize it's this because it's in a .each function.  The .each is iterating over an object  thus this.type applies.
[07:05:23] <javalover> If it was an array that wouldn't work, I see now.
[07:06:19] <javalover> javascript always confuses me because {} and [] are just so similar it's hard to tell an object from an array.
[07:06:48] <nodist> wat
[07:06:52] <javalover> especially since i think data is an Array contatining 2 objects.
[07:06:59] <javalover> containing*
[07:07:28] <javalover> don't worry about it nodist i've caused enough trouble imma go back to watching twitch lol

[09:15:40] <Arcarc> I have never experienced anything so frustrating
[09:16:31] <Arcarc> I can't find anything about the "function foo(a, b) { }" keyword
[09:16:38] <robertmaxrees> what do you mean?
[09:16:41] <robertmaxrees> that's a function.
[09:17:07] <Arcarc> Indeed, try searching "jquery function" or just "function" on any jQuery help site though :|
[09:17:15] <robertmaxrees> that's not a jquery thing.
[09:17:18] <robertmaxrees> that's a javascript thing.
[09:17:22] <robertmaxrees> what are you trying to figure out?
[09:17:26] <Arcarc> Oh lol... stupid me.
[09:17:37] <robertmaxrees> fwiw - jquery isn't a language.  it's a library :)
[09:18:03] <Arcarc> Anyway, I want to know how I can alter a variable from inside a function so that is altered outside the function
[09:18:09] <Arcarc> Poorly phrased, but you probably understand me
[09:18:13] <robertmaxrees> maybe?
[09:18:20] <robertmaxrees> that's not a very good idea though.
[09:18:54] <Arcarc> I could paste the function
[09:19:02] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/ :)
[09:20:49] <Arcarc> robertmaxrees: http://jsfiddle.net/7wvoarnL/
[09:21:27] <Arcarc> It would be convenient if I could just receive updated hoverStartDate/hoverEndDate variables from calling the function
[09:24:57] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[09:25:20] <robertmaxrees> okay, so it looks like you're confused about some JS basics :)
[09:25:42] <Arcarc> That's why I'm asking if there's something like that, like there is in almost every other language :O
[09:25:54] <robertmaxrees> there is, but you're confused about how it works.
[09:26:10] <robertmaxrees> modifying global vars is usually frowned upoen.
[09:26:12] <robertmaxrees> *upon
[09:26:14] <Arcarc> (For the record, I wasn't expecting that piece of code to do that)
[09:26:20] <robertmaxrees> so - http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/69e3y7rL/
[09:26:30] <robertmaxrees> if you wanted to modify global vars, this is how you do that.
[09:26:55] <robertmaxrees> the issue is that you passed them in as parameters to the function.
[09:27:05] <Arcarc> I want that code to be reusable for other variables though, not just hoverBlabla
[09:27:05] <robertmaxrees> when you do that, the function basically "copies" the values and modifies them local to that scope.
[09:27:14] <robertmaxrees> ^ you can't do that.
[09:27:21] <Arcarc> :@
[09:27:24] <robertmaxrees> you could return the values out of the function, instead, which is what you really want.
[09:27:42] <Arcarc> Is it possible to return two values at once?
[09:27:47] <Arcarc> If so, that's what I want
[09:27:51] <robertmaxrees> as an object, sure.
[09:28:30] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/v1v0uqap/
[09:28:47] <robertmaxrees> you can't return multiple variables.
[09:28:58] <robertmaxrees> it you need to pass values around, call and return from functions explicitly.
[09:30:34] <robertmaxrees> also: .on() is favored over .live() these days.
[09:31:09] <Arcarc> Alright!
[09:31:21] <robertmaxrees> check out the delegated syntax for it.
[09:32:49] <Arcarc> Actually, I'm still not sure how one would write a hypothetical function like function calculateFooAndBar() {}
[09:33:03] <Arcarc> Does one return an object that contains foo and bar?
[09:33:19] <robertmaxrees> you could return an object that contains those properties, sure.
[09:33:30] <robertmaxrees> you could also have a calculateFoo() and a calculateBar()
[09:34:05] <Arcarc> Hmm aight, I understand. Slightly disappointing, but I see :)
[09:34:09] <Arcarc> Thanks for the help
[09:34:29] <robertmaxrees> you'll actually find it easier and better in the long run :)
[09:34:49] <robertmaxrees> global, mutable data is gross.
[09:35:29] <Arcarc> Yeah, the global part is nothing I advocate -- just laziness here
[09:36:12] <Arcarc> But having to either have multiple functions or parse an object isn't exactly as effective as it can optimally be
[09:36:19] <Arcarc> But I'm sure it will become second nature
[09:36:32] <robertmaxrees> i think it's terribly effective personally - you're being explicit.
[09:37:31] <Arcarc> Gotcha
[09:37:57] <sebbers> do you really Arcarc
[09:38:03] <robertmaxrees> lol
[09:38:09] <sebbers> :p
[09:38:54] <Arcarc> Well, depends
[09:39:12] <Arcarc> It sounds like syntactic salt, that makes things clearer, but is slower/harder to type
[09:39:19] <robertmaxrees> i don't think it's any harder.
[09:39:42] <sebbers> ya i agree with robertmaxrees
[09:39:43] <Arcarc> In C++, it would literally mean adding a *
[09:39:45] <robertmaxrees> and the small overhead of having to type a few extra characters now is well work the clarity i'll get later.
[09:40:30] <Arcarc> Anyway, dinnertime, talk to y'all later
[09:41:17] <sebbers> cheers
[10:14:52] <Forbidd3n> Anyone here use or have used flot and know why labels do not show up on the chart if they are below 1%

[10:33:41] <monk3y> Heh k.
[10:34:08] <monk3y> Forbidd3n: aiight, dang.  I see it didn't mention values but thought the other plugin they recommend might have patched it.
[11:28:21] <sweet2k4> quick question: "does $.('element').chnage" add an eventslisterner that triggers on chnage?
[11:28:29] <sweet2k4> chnae
[11:28:39] <robertmaxrees> $('element').change() you mean?
[11:29:11] <robertmaxrees> and yes.
[11:30:08] <sweet2k4> robertmaxrees: yes, exactly. so i can call a function in that.chnage()?
[11:30:14] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[11:30:26] <sweet2k4> $('element').change(doSometthing())
[11:30:33] <robertmaxrees> .change(theFunction)
[11:30:36] <robertmaxrees> no parens after
[11:30:39] <sweet2k4> why?
[11:30:46] <robertmaxrees> because you want to pass the object.
[11:30:57] <robertmaxrees> .change(functionName()); will run the function immediately and bind the return to the change event.
[11:30:59] <robertmaxrees> not what you want.
[11:31:20] <sweet2k4> hmm ok
[11:31:33] <sweet2k4> i need to investigate this further
[11:31:39] <sweet2k4> what is the object in this case?
[11:31:47] <robertmaxrees> the function.
[11:31:55] <sweet2k4> and i want to pass it where?
[11:31:57] <robertmaxrees> in js, everything is an object.
[11:32:02] <robertmaxrees> to the change method.
[11:32:04] <robertmaxrees> one sec.
[11:33:03] <sweet2k4> is it correct to say that: you create an referense to the function
[11:33:26] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/d1x6c2a1/
[11:33:29] <sweet2k4> bound and triggerd by the change event
[11:33:33] <robertmaxrees> open your console and hitth that link.
[11:33:51] <robertmaxrees> see how you get "bar called" immediately on pageload, but not when you click the link?
[11:33:59] <robertmaxrees> but you get "foo called" only when you click the link?
[11:35:50] <sweet2k4> it didnt run in the firefox console. il try chrome
[11:35:57] <robertmaxrees> i'm in firefox...
[11:37:46] <sweet2k4> okey now it works, and why does bar get logged
[11:37:53] <sweet2k4> without clikcing the link
[11:37:55] <robertmaxrees> because it gets run immediately.
[11:38:00] <sweet2k4> becous of the ()
[11:38:02] <sweet2k4> ?
[11:38:02] <robertmaxrees> yes
[11:38:22] <robertmaxrees> $('a').on('click', bar()); runs bar when it gets evaluated.
[11:38:30] <robertmaxrees> you instead just want to tell .on() what object it should run.
[11:38:53] <sweet2k4> okey, i get it now.
[11:39:00] <sweet2k4> thanks for the help
[11:39:03] <robertmaxrees> definitely.
[11:42:23] <sweet2k4> robertmaxrees: but, if i would like to pass the value to the function, how is that done without ()?
[11:42:38] <robertmaxrees> you don't.
[11:42:59] <robertmaxrees> passing values to event handlers couples your logic too tightly.
[11:43:09] <robertmaxrees> could you show an example of what you're trying to do?
[11:44:20] <[non]> so i am creating mini slider
[11:44:24] <[non]> and i have this scrollright function
[11:44:24] <[non]> http://pastebin.com/UXEbRbXi
[11:44:28] <sweet2k4> ok. well. I have an input field. i want to pass the value to a function to processes it.
[11:44:28] <[non]> but i want to do this dynamically
[11:44:35] <robertmaxrees> sweet2k4 can you make a fiddle?
[11:44:40] <[non]> i mean when you press right it has to scroll 100 + 100 + 100 + 100..
[11:44:41] <robertmaxrees> [non] could you make a fiddle, too?
[11:44:42] <[non]> how can i do this?
[11:44:50] <sweet2k4> ok il try
[11:44:56] <robertmaxrees> [non] you mean you want to add 100 to the current scrollLeft?
[11:45:02] <[non]> yeah
[11:45:06] <robertmaxrees> get the current scrollLeft
[11:45:08] <[non]> currentElement
[11:45:09] <robertmaxrees> then add 100 to it.
[11:45:10] <[non]> yeah
[11:45:19] <[non]> scrollLeft.offset().left ?
[11:45:28] <[non]> sorry. currentElement.offset().left?
[11:45:34] <robertmaxrees> https://api.jquery.com/scrollleft/
[11:45:37] <robertmaxrees> .scrollLeft()
[11:46:07] <sweet2k4> robertmaxrees: i get it now, i dont need to send the value, i can store it in a varible when the function runs
[11:46:17] <robertmaxrees> sweet2k4 don't store it in a global variable.
[11:46:21] <robertmaxrees> that's not a good idea.
[11:46:48] <sweet2k4> like var value = ('element').value()
[11:47:14] <robertmaxrees> what are you then doing with it?
[11:47:29] <sweet2k4> im going to get a value from an input field and then proccses it
[11:47:35] <sweet2k4> in a function
[11:47:39] <robertmaxrees> so pass it to other functions?
[11:47:46] <robertmaxrees> just pass it explicitly via an argument.
[11:48:05] <sweet2k4> il make a fiddle, one sec
[11:51:28] <sweet2k4> robertmaxrees: http://jsfiddle.net/d1x6c2a1/2/

[11:58:21] <sweet2k4> robertmaxrees: thanks again, now everything works
[12:04:49] <notchris> robertmaxrees: TY
[12:05:03] <notchris> robertmaxrees: I’m replacing a number select on an old system
[12:05:11] <notchris> robertmaxrees: That has numbers in a TD
[12:05:25] <notchris> robertmaxrees: The old script would grab the inner html of the td to get the number
[12:05:46] <notchris> robertmaxrees: but I’ve replaced the td with a number input, however, the script is trying to get the inner html of the number input
[12:06:00] <notchris> Can I set the inner html of a number input to the current value of the number input
[12:06:05] <notchris> So that the script will still function
[12:06:07] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[12:06:23] <robertmaxrees> that last sentence makes no sense.
[12:06:27] <notchris> robertmaxrees: I realize that
[12:06:39] <notchris> robertmaxrees: Basically, theres a script that lets people select how many tickets they want
[12:06:53] <robertmaxrees> hold up.
[12:06:54] <notchris> robertmaxrees: the script grabs the inner html of a TD, that has the current number of tickets you want
[12:07:04] <robertmaxrees> make a single sentence of the problem.
[12:08:59] <notchris> There is a script that lets people select how many tickets they want. There are two buttons that I do not need that update a number within a TD. The “total amount” just gets the inner html of that TD to update the total. I have replaced the TD and the buttons that update the number of tickets with an actually number input. However, the script is still looking to grab the inner html of the element, which is now a number input. Is there a way to m
[12:09:00] <notchris> it so that the inner html of the number input reflects the value of the number input so that the script will still work?”
[12:09:13] <robertmaxrees> err, that cut off.
[12:09:20] <robertmaxrees> i feel like you're overcomplicating something.
[12:09:49] <notchris> robertmaxrees: https://tickets.ctsciencecenter.org/public/auto_choose_ga.asp?area=1&interface=20
[12:09:52] <robertmaxrees> setting the innerhtml of an input doesn't really make sense.
[12:10:02] <robertmaxrees> can you make a fiddle?
[12:10:12] <notchris> I cant make a fiddle to replicate it correctly
[12:10:13] <robertmaxrees> and that link is blank for me.
[12:10:24] <notchris> Really?
[12:10:26] <robertmaxrees> yes.
[12:10:39] <robertmaxrees> it sounds like you need to change the other script to read the value of the input, instead of the innerhtml.
[12:10:43] <notchris> Try this sorry: https://tickets.ctsciencecenter.org/public/default.asp?interface=20
[12:10:47] <notchris> I cant change the script
[12:10:55] <notchris> The example is on “General Admission"
[12:11:04] <robertmaxrees> then you need to modify things back, because setting the innerhtml of the input doesn't really make sense.
[12:11:20] <notchris> I realize, if you get to where the example is it may be clearer
[12:11:31] <robertmaxrees> i'd really rather not traipse around the entire page.
[12:11:32] <robertmaxrees> sorry.
[12:11:40] <notchris> Ok
[12:16:06] <Ice_Strike> Why this won't work
[12:16:07] <Ice_Strike> $(".btnUpdateStatus[value='on hold']").addClass(cssClass);
[12:16:18] <Ice_Strike> .btnUpdateStatus is a <button>
[12:16:20] * robertmaxrees looks into his crystal ball
[12:16:26] <robertmaxrees> i have no idea.
[12:17:45] <Ice_Strike> Hmmm
[12:20:03] <graphettion> Ice_Strike: There shouldn't be a space in value='on hold'
[12:20:22] <robertmaxrees> that.. doesn't seem right nto me.
[12:20:40] <Ice_Strike> Huh?
[12:21:11] <robertmaxrees> graphettion http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/b0kfgtuh/
[12:21:53] <graphettion> Ah, I'm used to attributes that don't.
[12:22:05] <Ice_Strike> Hmmm
[12:22:14] <robertmaxrees> value can have basically anything in it.
[12:22:15] <graphettion> My mistake.
[12:22:53] <graphettion> Ice_Strike: Is cssClass a variable string?
[12:24:56] <Ice_Strike> Yes
[12:25:01] <Ice_Strike> Thanks
[12:25:08] <Ice_Strike> var cssClass = (value == "complete") ? 'btn-success' : 'btn-warning';
[12:25:11] <Ice_Strike> :)
[12:25:17] <robertmaxrees> make that a ===
[12:25:38] <Ice_Strike> Sure
[12:25:40] <Ice_Strike> $(".btnUpdateSessionStatus[data-section-type=" +  section + "]").removeClass("btn-success btn-warning");
[12:25:44] <Ice_Strike> That work great too.
[12:25:58] <Ice_Strike> I was using $(".btnUpdateSessionStatus").each(function() { } before to match it.
[12:26:40] <Ice_Strike> instead of: $(".btnUpdateSessionStatus").each(function() { if ($(this).data("section-type") == section) { 	$(this).removeClass("btn-success btn-warning"); } 	})
[12:26:58] <robertmaxrees> it's so hard to read code on one line like that haha
[12:27:25] <Ice_Strike> True
[12:27:29] <Ice_Strike> Is there other way?
[12:27:34] <robertmaxrees> jsfiddle
[12:33:23] <Ice_Strike> robertmaxrees http://jsfiddle.net/Ld649dhv/1/
[12:33:55] <robertmaxrees> okay - so what are you trying to do here?
[12:34:18] <robertmaxrees> because this code works
[12:34:49] <Ice_Strike> I mean which is better
[12:34:58] <Ice_Strike> or alternative better way
[12:35:20] <robertmaxrees> is it at all possible to not use data attributes here?
[12:35:54] <Ice_Strike> Oh I do need it there
[12:36:51] <robertmaxrees> one sec.
[12:36:58] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/Ld649dhv/2/
[12:37:02] <robertmaxrees> i tend to prefer .filter()
[12:37:11] <robertmaxrees> data attributes really aren't meant for selecting.
[12:37:33] <Ice_Strike> Yep.
[12:37:46] <robertmaxrees> so grab all the elements and filter them instead.  call it a day.
[12:43:12] <fission6_> i am using select2, how do i avoid the dropdown flickering from the original/default state to the select2 state/ui?
[12:45:06] <Ice_Strike> robertmaxrees http://pastebin.com/Awf19Qjk
[12:45:13] <Ice_Strike> What do you think of this code? It work well.
[12:47:13] <robertmaxrees> could use some cleanup, and i would ditch $(".btnUpdateSessionStatus[data-section-type=" + section + "]").removeClass("btn-success btn-warning"); in favor of the new filtering method.
[12:49:14] <robertmaxrees> https://bpaste.net/show/db8c58557709 - i'd also use deferreds.
[12:51:35] <fission6_> is there a way to avoid the flicker caused when select2 renders?
[12:51:43] <robertmaxrees> fission6_ not really.
[12:51:52] <robertmaxrees> not without some janky hacks.
[12:52:17] <fission6_> ok
[12:53:56] <aqisnotliquid> Does anyone have any recommendations for a practical implementation of sessionStorage with AJAX?
[12:55:02] <rubyonrailed> When I am putting numbers over 1 million through this.  https://gist.github.com/anonymous/a20363d15c13764150de  it wont add the entire number. So 1,250,675 will get added as 1,250. What is happening here?
[12:55:10] <robertmaxrees> i don't understand what those two things have to do with each other, aqisnotliquid :)
[12:55:24] <robertmaxrees> rubyonrailed huh?
[12:55:31] <robertmaxrees> could you show us an example?
[12:56:08] <rubyonrailed> yeah one second
[12:56:43] <aqisnotliquid> robertmaxrees: I have a function that does an ajax call to get a JSON object to convert into a dropdown. This function can be called multiple times per page load and each session might have 3-5 page loads. I'd like to make the call for that information only once, then use the cached version every time after
[12:57:13] <robertmaxrees> aqisnotliquid ajax calls are cached just like any other.
[12:57:36] <Ice_Strike> robertmaxrees Thats great
[12:57:37] <Ice_Strike> thanks!
[12:57:38] <robertmaxrees> make sure your server responds with all the correct headers.
[12:58:37] <Ice_Strike> robertmaxrees  With your code, this dont seem to work removeClass('btn-success btn-warning')
[12:58:56] <robertmaxrees> if i had a fiddle i could poke.
[12:58:59] <robertmaxrees> but the basic idea is thjere.
[12:59:03] <Ice_Strike> Yep
[12:59:52] <rubyonrailed> robertmaxrees: https://jsfiddle.net/zffeooke/
[13:00:41] <Ice_Strike> robertmaxrees Ah I know why its not working. There is two buttons. It wont remove other class from other button
[13:00:45] <Ice_Strike> but it has return.
[13:00:53] <robertmaxrees> Ice_Strike huh?
[13:01:03] <robertmaxrees> rubyonrailed easy - amount = parseFloat(amount.replace(',', ''));
[13:01:12] <robertmaxrees> rubyonrailed that's replacing the first comma.  not any others.
[13:01:31] <robertmaxrees> rubyonrailed https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/zffeooke/1/
[13:02:59] <rubyonrailed> robertmaxrees: Thanks!
[13:04:54] <supsup> why does giving a input of type submit name="submit" cause jquery's .submit() method to fail?  I see in the docs it says:  "Forms and their child elements should not use input names or ids that conflict with properties of a form, such as submit, length, or method. Name conflicts can cause confusing failures."  what is improper about name="submit" tho?
[13:05:21] <robertmaxrees> name="submit"?
[13:05:25] <supsup> yeah
[13:05:25] <robertmaxrees> why would you name it "submit"?
[13:05:36] <supsup> i did not backend code is ;-0
[13:05:46] <robertmaxrees> that's confusing.
[13:05:50] <supsup> i already changed the code but I was just curious
[13:05:52] <robertmaxrees> and doesn't really make any sense.
[13:05:55] <Caelum> are there any plans to add a selector syntax for properties
[13:05:56] <Etriaph> Hi folks.  I used $.getJSON to fetch a collection from my app and have assigned the returned value to a variable.  When I spit out that variable using console.log I can see a property 'responseJSON'; when I debug that property using console.log it comes out as undefined.  Am I missing something?
[13:06:06] <robertmaxrees> Caelum what do you mean?
[13:06:14] <rcyr> supsup: Because of an old DOM feature where you could select elements by their name by doing formNode['thename']
[13:06:14] <robertmaxrees> Caelum you mean select on other attributes?
[13:06:30] <Caelum> robertmaxrees: to select things that are properties and not attributes
[13:06:33] <robertmaxrees> Etriaph can you show some code?
[13:06:33] <supsup> ahh ok rcyr
[13:06:35] <rcyr> supsup: Guess what happens when you have an element with a name 'submit', it's overwrites the function
[13:06:43] <Caelum> robertmaxrees: like if I want to do img[complete=false] // except that doesn't work
[13:06:44] <robertmaxrees> Caelum can you give an example of what you mean?
[13:06:49] <supsup> ooo
[13:06:50] <Etriaph> robertmaxrees: I can show you coffeescript, are you good with that?
[13:06:55] <robertmaxrees> Etriaph nope.
[13:07:07] <supsup> yah i mean i figured out the problem I was just wondering why more than that blurb thanks!
[13:07:10] <Etriaph> robertmaxrees: OK, lemme convert it, hold a moment
[13:07:25] <robertmaxrees> Caelum you can use .filter(), but i don't imagine them ever implementing what you're looking for.
[13:07:44] <Caelum> robertmaxrees: yup that's what I'm doing
[13:08:06] <Caelum> robertmaxrees: it seems like it would not be a big deal, just use some other bracket and check properties instead of attributes....
[13:08:08] <Etriaph> robertmaxrees: https://gist.github.com/bewitchingme/331718cae54ddfd488b4
[13:08:18] <robertmaxrees> Caelum that looks outside of scope of what sizzle does IMO.
[13:08:26] <robertmaxrees> Caelum feel free to take it to the devs though.
[13:08:57] <Etriaph> robertmaxrees: Line 35 and beyond
[13:09:00] <rcyr> supsup: http://jsfiddle.net/j9b2gz97/ :)
[13:09:02] <Etriaph> The rest is context
[13:09:42] <robertmaxrees> Etriaph Gallery.gallery_items = function(slide_show_url) {} isn't doing what you think it is.
[13:09:56] <Etriaph> robertmaxrees: OK, can you correct me?
[13:10:01] <robertmaxrees> that returns immediately, not with the results of the call.
[13:10:40] <Etriaph> robertmaxrees: So how does items have the property with an evaluated object?
[13:10:59] <robertmaxrees> i have no idea what hackery is going on there, but use .done()
[13:11:11] <Etriaph> After $.getJSON?
[13:11:12] <robertmaxrees> items.done(function(data) { console.log(data) });
[13:11:29] <supsup> rcyr surprised I’ve never run into this before ;-0 i guess i never thought to use names with those values.
[13:11:44] <Etriaph> robertmaxrees: Ah, OK.  I'll just specify a callback with $.getJSON then, probably best.
[13:11:49] <robertmaxrees> or that.
[13:12:05] <Etriaph> robertmaxrees: Thanks for being a second eye :D
[13:12:09] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[13:14:27] <rcyr> supsup: It happened to me a fear years ago... spent an enormous amount of time finding the "bug"
[13:14:34] <rcyr> *a few years
[13:16:55] <supsup> rcyr: why does the form still work if you click the submit button tho (non-js), guessing that does not use the form['submit'] method like jquery but uses something else
[13:17:15] <rcyr> Yup, it's just that
[13:17:25] <supsup> i see what you mean by it's a function property
[13:17:38] <supsup> and by setting it to an input you make it into a string property
[13:17:48] <rcyr> A node property
[13:17:53] <supsup> yeah DOM
[13:17:56] <supsup> always forget
[13:18:04] <supsup> ~~ ok thanks that's cool to know
[13:19:57] <morfin> wait a second hmm
[13:20:31] <morfin> is not second parameter a "context" so if i do $("a",{...}) it would try to find it in there?
[13:21:18] <rcyr> No...
[13:21:26] <rcyr> morfin: A context is a "starting node"
[13:21:52] <rcyr> $(selector, context) is the same as context.find(selector)
[13:21:59] <morfin> yes i know
[13:22:20] <morfin> i remember one guy was asking why he can't create an element
[13:22:51] <morfin> seems like he had to do $("<a>",{...})
[13:25:00] <rcyr> When you create elements, you don't need the second parameter.
[13:25:23] <morfin> second parameter allows you set attributes
[14:19:48] <cek> how do i created nested set of elements/
[14:19:55] <cek>         (($('<div>', class: 'row', id: "panel_cont_#{uuidsel}").
[14:19:55] <cek>           append($('<div>', class: 'small-12 columns transaction_details_container'))).
[14:19:55] <cek>           append($('<div>', {class: 'remote_call error'}).html(error_msg))).
[14:19:55] <cek>           insertAfter($selected_row)
[14:19:58] <cek> doesn't work properly.
[14:20:09] <cek> i need div inside div inside div etc
[14:22:32] <cek> var pdiv = $( "p" );
[14:22:32] <cek> pdiv.add( "div" ); // WRONG, pdiv will not change
[14:22:45] <cek> nice docs........ why the hell don't they explain what is the CORRECT method of that?
[14:23:47] <cek> "To place it on the page, we could add one of the insertion methods to the chain."
[14:23:50] <cek> how?!!!!!!!
[14:25:02] <cek> Also, why the heck would you name method "append()" and it's clearly an "insert()"
[14:25:16] <cek> *if it's clearly
[14:25:18] <shoky> it's an append because it inserts at the end
[14:25:25] <shoky> whereas prepend inserts at the beginning
[14:25:38] <shoky> insert() is too generic a name
[14:25:42] <cek> thats overly confusing, it should've been named insert_last()
[14:25:56] <ngharo> 0_o
[14:25:59] <cek> append is when you append to something, not insert
[14:26:04] <shoky> it's based on the plain DOM api probably.. .appendChild etc
[14:26:08] <cek> append is much like add
[14:26:25] <cek> well, append a child sounds more like it
[14:26:35] <cek> we want to append a child , that is, insert.
[14:26:36] <ngharo> add() only manipulates the chained jquery object
[14:26:39] <ngharo> iirc
[14:26:46] <ngharo> so, it's not like append
[14:26:53] <cek> they're all chained. What is a chained obj?
[14:27:05] <cek> $().func( return this ) -- chained
[14:27:11] <shoky> pdiv = pdiv.add("div")  would change pdiv
[14:27:26] <cek> shoky: see above
[14:27:31] <ngharo> someObj.add('selector') -- adds watever 'selector' to someObj collection
[14:27:32] <cek>  // WRONG, pdiv will not change
[14:27:53] <shoky> cek: i added  pdiv =   in front
[14:28:39] <cek> not clear what append() returns
[14:28:46] <cek> does it return newly added child?
[14:28:53] <cek> does it return original element?
[14:28:58] <ngharo> try it and find out
[14:29:03] <cek> does it return somethign else? What kind of crappy docs are that
[14:29:59] <cek> I'm not here for trying. I want to get the work done quick and get the fuck out of here. I have life outside.
[14:30:27] <ngharo> then i'm not here for helping if you're not here for trying :)
[14:33:37] <cek> returns original element
[14:37:45] <cool_boy> how do I select div with  class="entry total" http://jsfiddle.net/gqrmr3rv/ ?
[14:38:22] <cool_boy> $('.entry .total') $('.entry') $('.total') giving me null
[14:39:24] <ngharo> http://jsfiddle.net/gqrmr3rv/2/
[15:42:55] <nikio_> why is this not working?
[15:42:57] <nikio_> $('<dt> bobo </dt><dd> oko </dd>').appendTo(".output");
[15:43:04] <nikio_> '<dt> bobo </dt><dd> oko </dd>' is not a valid selector.
[15:43:17] <nikio_> but it works if i run the page
[15:43:24] <nikio_> just not n the console
[16:06:49] <hagabaka> is there a "multiselect" plugin like select2 or chosen, which always displays the choices instead of showing them in a popup/drop down? select2 has the option but it's really buggy
[16:45:50] <bryanbailes> Is there a way to iterate through the widgets that are attached to a particular element?
[16:46:22] <bryanbailes> ex: $("widgetdiv")[].each()
[16:47:44] <rcyr> What are widgets?
[16:49:07] <bryanbailes> JQuery-UI widget framework
[16:49:19] <bryanbailes> widget factory*
[16:50:35] <bryanbailes> So, I attach the widgets like $("widgetdiv").dialog(); $("widgetdiv").progressbar(); and I want to iterate through $("#widgetdiv") and see what widgets are attached.
[16:52:11] <bryanbailes> nevermind, figured it out using data() :)
[17:57:52] <acidjazz> whats the deal w/ JS style for names like, bob, Bob, and BOB
[20:01:10] <jiashenC> how can I include jQuery UI on website and make loading speed quick
[20:03:19] <Palmer11> ……. you should prob read up on the docs
[20:03:34] <Palmer11> as for speed, that could very depending on your site performance output
[20:05:37] <jiashenC> I used to use google CDN but it is not stable in China, which reduces loading speed.
[20:06:15] <jiashenC> Other good ways to include jQuery UI?
[20:23:33] <mdev> ji rent a fast VPS in california from lowendtalk.com and lowendbox.com(both same thing one is forums other is their main)
[20:23:39] <mdev> for a few dollars a month and put jquery on it
[20:23:54] <mdev> or maybe can find online cdn that does it via google
[20:24:15] <mdev> but is better to rent so you know it'll stay there, and cali is closest US state to China
[20:35:39] <SirLagz> mdev: do you want a VPS or just a website?
[20:38:09] <SirLagz> mdev: oh wait, misread lol.
[20:38:28] <SirLagz> never mind me...
