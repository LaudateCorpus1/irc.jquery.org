[00:00:12] <|pez|> Cause as all good girls that go out to dance, I put on way to little clothes to go outside in this cold autumny-time
[00:00:38] <mazzachre> Good girls != too little clothes...
[00:01:11] <coldhead> thanks abjorn
[00:01:21] <|pez|> Nothing wrong with the clothes themselves, I didn't look skimpy or anything. Just... too cold for this season.
[00:02:10] * coldhead hands out blankets for warmth and modesty
[00:02:11] <mazzachre> Ah, got it
[00:02:36] <abjorn> psssh
[00:02:45] <abjorn> more is less
[00:02:52] <|pez|> I'm awesome being me, so I don't need to dress skimpy.
[00:03:09] <abjorn> just like less is more
[00:03:26] <abjorn> BECAUSE THIS IS UNIX DAMNIT
[00:03:33] <|pez|> RAWR!
[00:03:51] <coldhead> let's all just agree that standards of decency are at best a vexed issue, and that anyone who bothers covering any of their naked human shame deserves congratulations
[00:04:32] <abjorn> especially coldhead, because no one wants to see that
[00:04:33] <mazzachre> Well, I was asked to go semi nude to the hawaii party this weekend, but I chose modesty... I even had a shirt on :p
[00:05:58] <coldhead> see some people would call that racist against hawaiians but i wouldn't. i'd just sit under the stairs quietly weeping for humanity
[00:06:12] <abjorn> just like every other day
[00:06:13] <coldhead> because that's how i roll
[00:07:08] <mazzachre> Well, humanity needs a lot of weeping, son't think it will fix anything though, so better go party :)
[00:07:18] <|pez|> I felt decent, because I had some semi-woolen ( but nice looking )... stockings? on under my short shorts XD
[00:09:43] <mazzachre> Hmm... I wore a suit and a colorful shirt... take that hawaians :D
[00:10:01] <mazzachre> Not very south pacific I know, but it was 12C outside...
[00:10:21] <|pez|> I'm pretty sure we were close to 0C on saturday night.
[00:10:49] <mazzachre> 0c is when when water freeze up...
[00:11:03] <mazzachre> 0.01c is when water can be in all 3 phases...
[00:11:06] <|pez|> Yeaaah?
[00:12:10] <blackspotwiggins> mazzachre, there are more than 10 phases for water :)
[00:13:00] <mazzachre> ...
[00:13:14] <blackspotwiggins> dot-dot-dot
[00:13:25] <mazzachre> ellipsis
[00:14:09] <AdamPDotty> leave my dots alone!
[00:16:50] <coldhead> ‚Ä¶
[00:17:11] <blackspotwiggins> damn you and your unicode cleverness
[00:17:18] * AdamPDotty slaps coldhead around a bit with a large trout
[00:17:29] <AdamPDotty> h√§h?
[00:17:56] <coldhead> i stole that from snover
[00:18:06] <coldhead> he is a tragic for the unicode ellipsis
[00:18:10] <coldhead> i don't care for it myself
[00:25:46] <mazzachre> is class selection faster than attribute selection?!
[00:26:07] <coldhead> yes
[00:26:20] <coldhead> attribute selection sucks
[00:26:48] <coldhead> it selects every element in the dom then goes and makes a coffee and slowly filters through the elements while catching up on facebook and pinterest
[00:28:21] <mazzachre> ok, that sounds fun :) So, doing something like <input class="mydateselectorclassfilterthingie"> and $('.myclassselectorclassfilterthingie').datepicker(config) is the best way?
[00:30:09] <mazzachre> or $('input.mydateselectorclassfilterthingie') ?
[00:30:33] <blackspotwiggins> depending on your markup, the difference might by  nonexistant
[00:31:25] <mazzachre> Hmm... it is a mess of code, handled by a websphere portlet manager system... All in all very ugly code
[00:31:47] <mazzachre> I am trying to fix up on it, make it both more readable and run faster
[00:32:56] <Cork> mazzachre: $('input.mydateselectorclassfilterthingie') is slower then $('.myclassselectorclassfilterthingie')
[00:33:11] <Cork> you want as little extra selectors on the left of your fast selectors as possible
[00:33:22] <mazzachre> oh, ok
[00:33:34] <mazzachre> i didn't know that...
[00:33:51] <Cork> so unless you actually use the class on other elements, don't add the input field
[00:34:21] <Cork> though for classes you can have it on multiple places so you might need to
[00:34:37] <Cork> but its good to have that rule in mind
[00:35:29] <galymzhan> wow. So $('.error') is faster than $('div.error') ?
[00:35:37] <Cork> yes
[00:35:59] <mazzachre> Yes, I will keep that in mind... I am trying to convince my superiors that classes are OK for stuff that does not involve css
[00:36:06] <coldhead> it's probably still faster to do $('.class').filter('tag') than $('tag.class')
[00:36:15] <coldhead> if i were a younger woman i would make a jsperf test to prove it
[00:36:39] <galymzhan> ok. and will $('.error', '#some-container') be faster than plain class selector?
[00:36:48] <Cork> uh...
[00:37:08] <Cork> no you don't want to use a combined selector if you don't have to
[00:37:10] <mazzachre> #id would still be faster, afaik?
[00:37:13] <Cork> yes
[00:37:23] <star_prone> hi
[00:37:37] <Cork> galymzhan: when you select on a class sizzle more or less does a single document.getElementsByClass('error')
[00:37:38] <coldhead> ah starsy, hello
[00:37:53] <star_prone> i have an array like this: ["1", "2", "3"]
[00:38:07] <star_prone> and I try to send it via an ajax request
[00:38:36] <star_prone> but before sending it I strfingify it
[00:38:44] <Cork> uh... why?
[00:38:53] <star_prone> to send it as a json string
[00:39:02] <Cork> ok
[00:39:23] <Cork> and you put it in an object before you send it to ajax?
[00:39:55] <Cork> $.ajax(..., data: { key: JSON.stringify(arr) } ...); ?
[00:40:08] <star_prone> no
[00:40:15] <star_prone> I do something like this:
[00:40:25] <star_prone> var jsonIntervals = JSON.stringify(intervals_selected);
[00:40:45] <star_prone> and then $.ajax(..., data jsonIntervals,...)
[00:40:50] <Cork> that won't work
[00:40:55] <star_prone> :)
[00:41:04] <Cork> you will send a text blob as params to the server
[00:41:09] <Cork> and it won't be able to parse it
[00:41:10] <star_prone> so I should do like in your example
[00:41:17] <Cork> you need a key for you text
[00:41:33] <mazzachre> Or don't do the stringify yourself... $.ajax will do it for you AFAIK
[00:41:35] <Cork> servers expect key=value&key=value
[00:41:49] <Cork> no you can't send a plain array either
[00:41:55] <Cork> for the same reason
[00:42:11] <star_prone> so what should I do?
[00:42:16] <Cork> $.ajax(..., data: { key: JSON.stringify(arr) } ...) <--
[00:42:19] <mazzachre> No, you would do $.ajax({data: "mykey": array});
[00:42:25] <Cork> or just $.ajax(..., data: { key: arr } ...)
[00:42:28] <mazzachre> or that
[00:42:58] <Cork> the second solution will send each value as its own param key=value
[00:43:05] <Cork> so the query string will be MUCH longer
[00:43:28] <Cork> key[]=1&key[]=2&key[]=3...
[00:44:02] <Cork> compared to key=%5B1%2C2%2C3%5D
[00:44:14] <mazzachre> ya
[00:44:26] <mazzachre> depends on where you want to parse it in backend
[00:45:11] <star_prone> with my array, intervals = ["1", "2", "3"]
[00:45:26] <star_prone> this doesn't work $.ajax(..., data: { key: JSON.stringify(arr) } ...)
[00:45:46] <star_prone> I thing I will have to do the key=> value pairs
[00:45:47] <Cork> ?doens't work
[00:45:50] <bot-t> Cork, #3135 (Documentacion page doens't work) ñ jQuery Core - Bug ... - Opened 4 years ago http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/3135
[00:45:53] <Cork> lol
[00:46:06] <Cork> star_prone: doesn't work doesn't mean anything
[00:46:08] <mazzachre> star_prone: What backend are you using? PHP
[00:46:11] <mazzachre> `?
[00:46:16] <star_prone> PHP
[00:46:26] <star_prone> I do not receive any parameters
[00:46:29] <star_prone> nothing
[00:46:29] <Cork> star_prone: remember that most server languages doesn't parse json as params by default
[00:46:39] <star_prone> I know
[00:46:47] <Cork> star_prone: did you replace the arr variable with your own name?
[00:46:49] <star_prone> but I do not receive the json string
[00:46:52] <star_prone> to parse it
[00:46:56] <star_prone> :)
[00:47:01] <star_prone> yes, I did
[00:47:26] <star_prone> does jquery automatically sends the keys of the array?
[00:47:29] <star_prone> I mean
[00:47:47] <star_prone> if I do something like: var jsonIntervals = JSON.stringify(intervals_selected);
[00:47:47] <mazzachre> star_prone: read on your request in the console first then... see what client sends
[00:49:00] <star_prone> jsonIntervals will have the following values: ["1", "2", "3"]
[00:49:27] <star_prone> basically the same values, only that this time they are printed with a different colour in the console
[00:50:14] <star_prone> mazzachre: in the console, I can see under form data: intervals: 1
[00:50:17] <star_prone> intervals: 2
[00:50:20] <star_prone> and so on
[00:51:03] <Cork> star_prone: http://jsfiddle.net/qgFFA/1/
[00:51:32] <Cork> star_prone: that posts the array to / and something like that is what you need to do
[00:54:03] <star_prone> Cork: thank you
[00:54:08] <star_prone> I do the same thing
[00:54:15] <star_prone> and I get the same results
[00:54:34] <star_prone> which means that I'm doing something wrong in PHP
[00:54:46] <star_prone> since there I can't see the data sent
[00:56:26] <coldhead> Meanwhile: Committed revision 172560.
[00:56:26] <mazzachre> Is javascript code in headers run as soon as available? And will it generally be run before the dom is ready and other javascript is run?!
[00:57:20] <coldhead> yes and "it depends"
[00:57:42] * AdamPDotty depends
[00:58:56] <coldhead> it's like a song from Toy Story
[01:02:53] <mazzachre> What does it depend on? I have this issue where I have to set some global config objects that can be used inside some pages... I was planning on doing something like $('body').data('myconfigobject', myConfigObject); in my header included file then I can use it elsewhere under initializetion
[01:03:00] <mazzachre> initialization even
[01:06:51] <Cork> mazzachre: javascripts in the header blocks page rendering until they'r fetched
[01:07:29] <Cork> mazzachre: so if you put your js in the head you should ALWAYS wrap them in ready if you want to touch the dom
[01:07:54] <coldhead> because you might not have a document to operate on otherwise
[01:08:25] * Cork nods
[01:08:29] <AdamPDotty> no body in head
[01:08:56] <coldhead> like a <redacted for decency>
[01:09:23] <AdamPDotty> touched for the very first time?
[01:13:20] <sh0ne> How can I get text inside a tag (but only the first sentence) http://jsfiddle.net/fg8mC/ ?
[01:13:41] <sh0ne> I need just 'Hello, there' and not the '=>'
[01:14:03] <sh0ne> I used .text() but it returned both.
[01:15:29] <Cork> sh0ne: http://jsfiddle.net/fg8mC/1/
[01:16:21] <coldhead> http://jsfiddle.net/fg8mC/2/
[01:16:29] * coldhead shakes Cork's hand warmly
[01:16:55] <Cork> sh0ne: the cleanser way is to have a separate wrapper that only contains the text
[01:17:06] <Cork> and thats really how you should do it
[01:18:20] <coldhead> the cleanest way is alert('Hello there!')
[01:18:23] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/fg8mC/3/
[01:18:27] <coldhead> and leave the DOM out of it altogether
[01:18:29] <xec> http://jsfiddle.net/fg8mC/4/
[01:19:41] <coldhead> http://jsfiddle.net/fg8mC/5/
[01:20:34] <xec> lol, that's definitely the winner right there
[01:20:42] <sh0ne> Cork, coldhead, xec: thank you very much, people :)
[01:21:16] <mazzachre> Cork: OK... but they would be run first anyway?
[01:21:35] <Cork> mazzachre: what would run first?
[01:22:03] <mazzachre> So I can do what I need? Add global objects to document or body to fetch for some element enhancements
[01:22:21] <Cork> sure
[01:22:52] <DukeDrake> hi
[01:23:01] <mazzachre> It is stuff like language files and such... Global stuff for everything
[01:23:48] <DukeDrake> I got a problem if my data field contains numbers with leading 0's ... $('#mydatafield').data('phone') will erase the leading zero
[01:23:53] <DukeDrake> how can I fix this?
[01:25:08] <Cork> DukeDrake: that prob comes from data converting the value to Number
[01:25:32] <xec> .attr('data-phone') =
[01:25:34] <Cork> simplest would prob be to just to a dot infront or something
[01:25:36] <xec> ?*
[01:25:37] <Cork> or that ya :)
[01:25:56] <DukeDrake> Cork: a dot?
[01:26:12] <xec> assuming you were fetching html5 data-* attribute of course
[01:26:14] <Cork> ?eval Number('0001')
[01:26:17] <bot-t> Cork: 1
[01:26:19] <DukeDrake> Cork: the number displays as "89" instead of "089"  (... Germany)
[01:26:28] <Cork> DukeDrake: thats what happens
[01:26:51] <DukeDrake> Cork: exactly. I don't want that
[01:27:07] <Cork> DukeDrake: then use attr, or add a string character infront
[01:27:16] <Cork> data will try to convert
[01:27:27] <Cork> ex you can wrapp it in json
[01:27:48] <AdamPDotty> dot day today
[01:28:15] <xec> did you know that "today" backwards is "yadot"?
[01:28:17] <xec> :P
[01:29:01] <xec> DukeDrake: in case you didn't get what i meant: http://jsfiddle.net/vwwCt/
[01:29:17] <DukeDrake> attr dosn't work either :/
[01:29:24] <Dragoon> Mornin' everyone
[01:29:37] <xec> DukeDrake: can you show a live demo of it failing
[01:29:40] <Cork> DukeDrake: if attr doesn't work then your doing something that convert it
[01:29:59] * AdamPDotty scrambles his name to Pt. Mad Today
[01:30:14] <Dragoon> Could anyone direct me in how I can create a blocks transition like on: http://www.indg.com/
[01:30:34] <Dragoon> Can't seem to find the right tuts for it
[01:32:35] <ProLoser|Mac> anyone here use bootstrap plugins?
[01:32:43] <DukeDrake> maybe I set them wrong ... %)
[01:33:50] <DukeDrake> hmmm .. I set them via .attr('data-...') -.-
[01:34:24] <davidgilmour> hello guys.. i need a hand.. i'm getting some html content through ajax and the using html() on a div to put it into there.. however, the code i'm retrieving has javascript code in there, which the browser is parsing once I use the html() function.. is anyway work around?
[01:34:49] <ProLoser|Mac> davidgilmour: remove it?
[01:34:56] <ProLoser|Mac> crazy, i know
[01:35:05] <coldhead> surely pink floyd can afford to pay someone else to do their web site
[01:35:59] <xec> DukeDrake: what is the number var before you set it?
[01:36:26] <davidgilmour> any chance i can make the browser not parse the code?
[01:36:48] <ProLoser|Mac> if only davidgilmour payed attention...
[01:37:03] <DukeDrake> but thanx anyway .. now I have hint to work on
[01:37:17] <davidgilmour> i did
[01:37:25] <davidgilmour> removing the code is not an option
[01:37:50] <davidgilmour> so i would have to use regexp to filter out the code.. but i thought maybe there is an easier option
[01:38:16] <DukeDrake> hmmmm http://jsfiddle.net/vwwCt/1/ ... ??
[01:39:08] <xec> DukeDrake: yes, setting a string via .data() is different from setting a data-* attribute on the element.
[01:39:17] <DukeDrake> ok
[01:39:28] <DukeDrake> I set them via .attr
[01:39:32] <xec> DukeDrake: as is setting a number http://jsfiddle.net/vwwCt/2/
[01:40:53] <alket> hi, how to append <script> in a div element ?
[01:41:08] <xec> ?append
[01:41:09] <bot-t> .append(content, [content]): Insert content, specified by the parameter, to the end of each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/append/
[01:42:28] <davidgilmour> guess ill try with innerhtml
[01:42:56] <DukeDrake> ok
[01:43:05] <DukeDrake> the error is with php, I guess
[01:49:59] <DarsVaeda> hi, I put a simple "$('checkbox').change($('div').toggle())" which works BUT firefox saved the state of the checkbox, so if I reload and the box is checked the function is inverted
[01:50:04] <DarsVaeda> how to I go around that?
[01:52:33] <blackspotwiggins> DarsVaeda, $('div').toggle(this.checked)
[01:52:55] <blackspotwiggins> might be flipped, not sure if it shows or hides on true
[01:53:16] <DarsVaeda> nah works that way
[01:53:29] <DarsVaeda> that was one easy one, thanks :)
[02:04:13] <hackeron> I'm trying to get the closest div with class "livebox" to a selected option, I'm trying this $('select option:selected')[0].closest(".livebox") - but it's saying no method 'closest' - any ideas?
[02:05:27] <izual> Hi, is there any way to identify buffering in html5 videos with jquery?
[02:06:54] <boulet101010> hackeron: remove the [0]
[02:08:14] <houman> Hi, How can I search for an id within my given selector please?
[02:08:42] <boulet101010> $(selector) is the jQuery object, $(selector)[0] is the first dom element of the jQuery object
[02:09:10] <houman> e.g. this is my selector $newElement
[02:09:12] <houman> And I want to check a checkbox in that selector only $('#myId').prop('checked', true);
[02:09:58] <hackeron> boulet101010: ah, so if I want the dom element of the closest selector then I need $('select option:selected').closest(".livebox")[0]
[02:10:22] <boulet101010> true :)
[02:12:40] <blackspotwiggins> houman, ids are unique, you dont need to scope them
[02:12:41] <houman> boulet101010: Could I then do it like this? $(selector '#myId').prop('checked', true);
[02:13:04] <houman> well, I am cloning them at that point
[02:13:10] <houman> hence they are not unique yet
[02:13:27] <houman> until I change the name a bit later with .find()
[02:13:40] <blackspotwiggins> make them unique
[02:13:44] <blackspotwiggins> when cloning
[02:13:54] <blackspotwiggins> duplicate ids lead to undefined results
[02:14:04] <coder7of9> how do i trigger the onclick property of a radio box - without causing the element to become selected
[02:14:10] <coder7of9> please
[02:14:13] <houman> ok, newElement.find(':input').each(function() { .. }  in there I do change the id's to be unique
[02:14:45] <houman> But thats async, so I was hoping to set the checkbox to be true before making the id unique
[02:15:12] <boulet101010> houman: wasn't answering to you sorry.
[02:19:26] <jhsto> sup guys, does anyone know if i make a ajax post to a site, which responds lets say with cookies and a page redirection, is there a way me to hook up the client to that redirection?
[02:20:02] <riku> well you can return the url of the redirection
[02:20:03] <jhsto> so, if the post succeeds, take the client to that page?
[02:20:04] <riku> and then
[02:20:10] <riku> window.location = URL
[02:20:42] <jhsto> but lets say that if the page adds cookies and stuff, will the client get those cookies as well?
[02:20:46] <blackspotwiggins> jhsto, why the hell dont you just use normal http then?
[02:21:22] <jhsto> well, its bit complicated, since i should not expose the url of the POST page to the client
[02:22:06] <jhsto> i can make the call on the server-side, so no trace is left, but i should then take the client to the success page - with the cookies and all
[02:22:12] <blackspotwiggins> lol wat
[02:22:16] <jhsto> yea
[02:22:22] <blackspotwiggins> you think you cant see what url gets used in ajax?
[02:23:04] <jhsto> well, i did not find a trace when trying to sniff the http traffic when the ajax was called on my serverside
[02:23:23] <boulet101010> lol
[02:23:40] <blackspotwiggins> holy shit
[02:23:43] <blackspotwiggins> you are a wizard
[02:23:46] <boulet101010> w00t w00t
[02:24:25] <jhsto> i confirmed this now, did not find anything
[02:24:30] <jhsto> or at least i think so
[02:24:34] <jhsto> lol
[02:25:12] <boulet101010> do you use firebug or something like that?
[02:25:45] <firedfox> with chrome web inspector or firebug, i'm sure you can see it
[02:25:48] <boulet101010> in firebug you got a "net" tab where you can watch every http request between the site and the outside
[02:26:02] <boulet101010> even in opera dragonfly or in IE debugger
[02:26:33] <jhsto> im using google chrome developer debugger and firebug with jquery debugger, and no trace at all
[02:27:15] <jhsto> for your interest, im developing a bruteforce free login system as my sunday coding hobby
[02:27:43] <jhsto> but no, i could not even catch a single js call on firebug
[02:27:50] <boulet101010> o_O
[02:27:54] <firedfox> it's weird. something must be wrong.
[02:27:57] <boulet101010> try to "alert" as the ajax callback
[02:28:15] <blackspotwiggins> jhsto, maybe your ajax is broken
[02:28:26] <jhsto> no, im getting the response as i should be
[02:28:36] <blackspotwiggins> or do you srsly propose that the bits magically appear on the server without leaving the browser?
[02:28:41] <jhsto> i can call if the post was successful or not
[02:29:07] <jhsto> no, im not proposing anything lol
[02:29:22] <jhsto> i just want the client to follow that ajax call
[02:29:52] <blackspotwiggins> the thing is, what you are trying to do is replicate default browser behaviour
[02:30:04] <boulet101010> jhsto: and no JS error?
[02:30:11] <blackspotwiggins> and the reason you are saying that you cant use default browser behaviour is somewhat unbelievable
[02:30:12] <jhsto> no, js errors
[02:30:21] <jhsto> i mean, no js errors
[02:30:36] <jhsto> are you sure you noticed it when i said that the call is made server-side?
[02:31:57] <blackspotwiggins> .. what?
[02:32:01] <blackspotwiggins> serverside ajax?
[02:32:12] <jhsto> yea
[02:32:46] <Melsom> http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/fMhWK/5/ - Based on this code, how can I make it close all other viewInfo's when a new one is opened? regardless of movieRowContainer.
[02:33:26] <boulet101010> so, you use something like node.js to do this?
[02:33:32] <jhsto> exactly
[02:33:37] <jhsto> sorry for confusion
[02:33:46] <boulet101010> ok u__u
[02:33:53] <boulet101010> shame on us.
[02:36:13] <AdamPDotty> melsom: a number is not a valid id
[02:36:32] <jhsto> anyhow, if i make an ajax call on the client-side, will the client follow the post?
[02:36:46] <Melsom> AdamPDotty: hm, seems to be working inside the same movieRowContainer.
[02:39:04] <boulet101010> never tried to do this jhsto
[02:39:23] <firedfox> i'm not sure how you made the ajax call. if you do it with http.request(), you can get all cookies set by remote server and the url for redirection in the response header.
[02:40:12] <firedfox> then you can return a 302 response to the browser, make the direction and set all those cookies in the response header
[02:40:14] <blackspotwiggins> jhsto, why would you ask this in #jquery instead of whatever channel node.js uses?
[02:40:53] <jhsto> because im working with jquery actually, and besides the framework it has nothing to do with node
[02:41:24] <jhsto> i thought that asking to follow an ajax call of jquery would be more appropriated to ask in here
[02:42:19] <jhsto> ok, looks like i can at least get the html data of the page logged to my console
[02:43:10] <jhsto> i was just wondering, that in case the response includes cookies for instance, is it possible to parse the cookies from the response?
[02:43:28] <jhsto> ie. show the full response with headers and all
[02:43:56] <seutje> ?getAllResponseHeaders
[02:43:59] <bot-t> seutje, #8837 (jqXHR.getAllResponseHeaders() returns only 'Content-Type ... - Opened 18 months ago http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/8837
[02:44:48] <seutje> jhsto: you should be able to grab the response headers by calling that method on the jqXHR object
[02:45:02] <jhsto> as a callback?
[02:45:29] <jhsto> oh, now i see
[02:45:35] <jhsto> thanks seutje
[02:45:36] <boulet101010> $("#font-section option [value='optvalue']"); is this correct? beginning to rage...
[02:46:15] <seutje> boulet101010: I'm assuming you're trying to target <option value="optvalue"> ?
[02:46:39] <seutje> try $("#font-selection option[value='optvalue']")
[02:47:02] <seutje> your query was trying to grab a child of <option> that had that value

[02:47:46] <mazzachre> Is there a good way of transferring JSON objects from backend to frontend? Currently I use some data-xxx attributes and in my inititalization I transfer them with $(this).data('mydataarg', $.parseJSON($(this).attr('mydataarg')));
[02:49:11] <seutje> mazzachre: data attributes are fine for this, but when things get a bit large, I prefer to store them in my app's global namespace settings object and use the data attribute to reference it
[02:49:46] <seutje> oh wait, why aren't you using data-mydataarg="..." to begin with?
[02:51:06] <mazzachre> I am... <div data-mydataarg="{whatever: 'whatever'}"> and in my code I do $(this).data('mydataarg', $.parseJSON($(this).attr('data-mydataarg'))); for the div...

[02:54:28] <AdamPDotty> Melsom
[02:57:56] <jhsto> seutje, any idea could it be possible to make the client follow my ajax call, than by getting the full response header and parsing stuff from that? I'm currently making the ajax calls on my server-side on nodejs, but I can surely switch the calls to client-side. I just want to know that if I make an ajax post call on the client-side, will the client follow it, or will the post just be made on the background?
[02:58:25] <jhsto> I know this sounds extremely stupid without the right context, but please try to get something from it.
[02:59:21] <Cork> mazzachre: encode your data correctly and it should work just fine
[02:59:26] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/uumYm/
[02:59:42] <seutje> jhsto: sry, no clue what that means
[02:59:46] <Cork> mazzachre: but you need to put valid escaped json in the attribute
[03:00:37] <Cork> mazzachre: what you had before is valid javascript objects, but not valid json
[03:01:42] <Cork> jhsto: i have a vague guess at what your asking
[03:01:57] <jhsto> cork, lol hit me
[03:01:58] <Cork> jhsto: and no you can't get the browser to switch from ajax to a full page reload from server side
[03:02:17] <Cork> you need to make a new connection from the client
[03:02:27] <jhsto> i see
[03:02:34] <jhsto> but will it follow the post?
[03:02:35] <Cork> either to a link tag that the user clicks or window.location = <new location>
[03:02:43] <Cork> it follows redirects yes
[03:03:33] <jhsto> well, lets suppose im making that call on the client side, but during the post the client gets cookies added  and a redirection to /hello. Will the client ultimately get to the /hello with the cookies?
[03:04:03] <Cork> jhsto: that sentence doesn't make sense
[03:04:25] <jhsto> cork, thank you, i think im better of trying it out by myself
[03:04:39] <Cork> jhsto: the server can't ever call the client
[03:04:42] <jhsto> im horrible at trying to explain this stuff
[03:04:53] <Cork> the client connects to the server, and the server responds
[03:04:53] <jhsto> im hooked up to websockets
[03:04:57] <Cork> never the other way around
[03:05:02] <Cork> ah
[03:05:11] <Cork> well thats still true
[03:05:18] <jhsto> oh okay
[03:05:22] <Cork> you just have a permanent connection you can push data over :)
[03:05:38] <Cork> if the connection dies, only the client can reconnect
[03:10:17] <firedfox> jhsto, is your logic similar to this?
[03:10:18] <firedfox> client posts data to your server -> your server posts data to 3rd party server -> 3rd party server returns cookie and url -> your server returns them to client -> client sets cookie and redirects
[03:10:43] <jhsto> ya
[03:11:09] <jhsto> idk how you managed to work that out, but yes
[03:12:35] <firedfox> it can be done with node.js
[03:13:13] <paulmillar> Is there any reason why some JS would work in everything but IE8 and down?
[03:13:15] <firedfox> with http.request() and response.headers
[03:13:36] <firedfox> you can check the node.js api documents
[03:14:30] <firedfox> paulmillar, it accesses window.localStorage?
[03:14:36] <jhsto> although, the scenario is bit different: client post data to my server -> my server looks up some values set on the post, which it will then parse and send to the actual login page from where the client came from. then, it will route the client to the right place according to the results gotten from the ajax call
[03:15:55] <jhsto> so in other words, a page just sends data to my server instead of their own - set in the form action url
[03:15:56] <paulmillar> I don't think so no, one moment
[03:16:51] <paulmillar> Nope. This is the code: http://snipt.org/vPQ1

[03:44:48] <ozette> css gradients are used like a background, but can I define how far it stretches with jquery somehow?  for example, from 0% to 80% of the div it's in?
[03:45:07] <ozette> instead of 0% to 100%
[03:49:14] <dogmatic69> anyone know of a jquery plugin that does something similar to this http://supportdetails.com/
[03:49:45] <dogmatic69> minus the pdf / email stuff. just the checking bits.
[03:59:43] <aga> Why does $('#search-commercial-basic').children('.new-ad').html() return iframe with id and src, but when I do $('#search-commercial-basic').children('.new-ad').attr('src') it return undefined??
[04:00:39] <firedfox> dogmatic69, i don't know any plugin that does it. we can do it ourselves.
[04:01:28] <firedfox> maybe the flash version detection is a little bit complicated. others all quite simple.
[04:02:30] <dogmatic69> ye, I can do it. Would just be simple if its done already
[04:03:35] <clocKwize> hey guys, I have a <button><i class="icon-ok"></i></button> I'm doing $parent.on "click", "button", function () {} -- but if I click the actual icon, the click event isn't raised.. why not? shouldn't it bubble?
[04:04:36] <AdamPDotty> whats $parent?
[04:05:26] <clocKwize> the parent element of the button.. It works if I click the actual outer edge of the button, just not the icon inside it
[04:06:26] <AdamPDotty> I believe, not every element is clickable
[04:06:44] <AdamPDotty> and <i> is not even a current element

[04:17:24] <clocKwize> seutje, 1 sec
[04:18:05] <clocKwize> strange
[04:19:18] <seutje> clocKwize: here it is with using a bg image like you did: http://jsfiddle.net/EwEN3/1/
[04:19:40] <clocKwize> seutje, I've just added this: http://jsfiddle.net/EwEN3/2/ which causes my behaviour.... I have no code to do that as far as I can tell though
[04:20:16] <seutje> clocKwize: why are u using return false?
[04:20:23] <seutje> ?Return false
[04:20:24] <bot-t> 'return false' or call event.preventDefault() to prevent the browser's default action (such as navigation on a link) in an event callback. Example: $("#link").click(function(e){ e.preventDefault(); /* code here */ }) or $("#link").click(function(){ /* code here */; return false }); preventDefault() should be used in most cases.
[04:20:54] <clocKwize> habit I guess heh
[04:21:02] <seutje> return false does both e.preventDefault() as e.stopImmediatePropagation() (and some other shit iirc)
[04:21:28] <seutje> ergo, it prevent the event from bubbling up
[04:21:30] <clocKwize> oh, I think I just saw some code using e.preventDefault() return false many moons ago and just do that as I know it stops it..
[04:21:43] <clocKwize> I know, I was just using that as an example to show the behaviour I'm experiencing
[04:21:45] <seutje> but u don't want to stop it o.O
[04:21:54] <seutje> I'm confused
[04:22:04] <clocKwize> hehe sorry.
[04:22:06] <seutje> you have a problem because you deliberately created one? o.O
[04:22:11] <clocKwize> no
[04:22:28] <clocKwize> the click handler for the <i> I added to the fiddle is not in my own code
[04:22:46] <clocKwize> I just added that to show you what I'm experiencing
[04:23:05] <seutje> well that's obviously not what's causing it, if you don't have it in your code
[04:23:30] <clocKwize> I know, but the symptoms are the same. E.g. clicking BUTTONBUTTON raises no event, but clicking the edge of the button works
[04:24:10] <seutje> then see if there's an event handler on the inner element that is preventing bubbling
[04:26:09] <clocKwize> nothing that I can find
[04:26:34] <clocKwize> is there any way to see handlers attached to an event/

[04:31:31] <baheer> does any body can help me please?
[04:32:14] <Cork> baheer: first you shouldn't hijack the name attribute use data-id or something
[04:32:34] <Cork> secondly if you don't want to provide a valud url fallback don't use a tags

[04:40:32] <seutje> ChocoCooky: runs it when the DOM is ready
[04:40:37] <ChocoCooky> ahh
[04:40:47] <ChocoCooky> so it's not messing with the object at all
[04:40:50] <seutje> ChocoCooky: it's essentially $(document).ready(function() { ... });
[04:40:56] <clocKwize> seutje, I tried that - it just says: "0 events were found attached to 0 nodes. 0 events were attached to elements not currently in the document."

[04:41:11] <seutje> clocKwize: not sure if visualevent still works nowadays
[04:41:30] <clocKwize> seutje, thats the conclusion I came to :) Aslo , .data("events") returns null
[04:41:59] <seutje> clocKwize: might be a regular onclick attribute

[04:43:33] <clocKwize> well, both return undefined anyway..
[04:43:47] <Cork> how is the event listener bound?
[04:44:23] <clocKwize> Cork, I've no idea.. I'm just trying to find why an event isn't bubbling up from an <i/> inside a <button> (clicking the <i /> doesn't raise the buttons click event)

[06:33:23] <mowol> Hi. I want to do a form submit but i dont actually have a form. The reason i dont have a form is because the data i need to POST are stored in javascript. How can i then do a submit where i manually set the POST variables? :)
[06:34:31] <nFFF> ?post @ mowol
[06:34:32] <bot-t> mowol, jQuery.post(url, [data], [success], [dataType]): Load data from the server using a HTTP POST request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.post/
[06:34:52] <mowol> nFFF: i've looked at the, but i actually need to do the redirect with the POST data still intact
[06:35:12] <mowol> Ofcourse i could fill hidden fields onSubmit of a form, but that seems like a overcomplicated way of doing it
[06:35:42] <Shilon> on the active tab the masonry.jquery works fine, I change tab and the others are all bugged
[06:36:03] <MoneY_> hello. im tring to use jQuery.post(url, data) to send data to script. my data looks like that: [{a:'test',b:'test2'},{a:'test3',b:'test4'}] why cant i use that as data argument? and how can i transfor that?
[06:36:33] <Shilon> anyway I can make the masonry script reload on tab reload?
[06:37:15] <nFFF> MoneY_, not sure you can use an array for data
[06:37:31] <jeffsmykil> Im getting some atomxml data back from an ajax call and inside of it is a field called summary, with html tags
[06:37:32] <nFFF> think it needs to be an object
[06:37:40] <jeffsmykil> i want to scrape some of the data from those html tags
[06:37:43] <jeffsmykil> best way?
[06:37:57] <MoneY_> nFFF how to transform it to an obj?
[06:38:17] <nFFF> Well you are using an array of objects
[06:38:28] <nFFF> should be opposite, perhaps, an object containing an array
[06:38:57] <MoneY_> nFFF but js array does not support assisiation, right?
[06:39:11] <MoneY_> association
[06:42:31] <RickSchmitty> anyone know of a way to do a small validation on textarea which contains html markup -- basically just want to validate that they provided opening/closing tags w/o any missing quotes <div id="me>test</bold> = bad pie
[06:42:49] <termite> jeffsmykil: var html =  $("<div></div>").html(htmlfromxml);  Then use jquery ton html var
[06:43:21] <jeffsmykil> termite: yeah messy any way I do it ;)
[06:43:30] <jeffsmykil> anyone have a favorite xpath tool?
[06:43:38] <Cork> RickSchmitty: the browser doens't really contain any validating tools
[06:43:49] <Cork> RickSchmitty: you can auto correct the html, but thats about it
[06:44:03] <dannNiel> Hi. I've implement lazyload in my website. It works, but i've one problem. The first images are in the view, but lazyload doesn't show them
[06:44:06] <dannNiel> http://voodoo-club.mediasyndikat.com/fotos.html
[06:44:21] <RickSchmitty> thought so, thx cork
[06:44:22] <dannNiel> Does anybody know why this problem appears?
[06:46:47] <Cork> RickSchmitty: http://jsfiddle.net/AkXzT/
[06:46:57] <Cork> you could validate that the string length is the same i guess
[06:49:08] <termite> dannNiel: which problem?
[06:49:09] <Cork> dannNiel: you could try firing a scroll event on document
[06:49:27] <Cork> dannNiel: $(window).trigger('scroll')
[06:49:34] <Cork> not sure if that would fix it, but it might
[06:49:52] <dannNiel> i have to scroll, otherwise the first row doesn't show up. i've a 1440*960 resolution on my MB Pro
[06:50:07] <MoneY_> can i transform obj to urlencoded post params?
[06:50:47] <RickSchmitty> thx cork, nice way to convert - client was just looking for a way to alert someone they entered it wrong vs having it be autocorrected, but perhaps this will do, thx again
[06:50:56] <oliver3> Ah awesome, thanks Cork & termite. :-)
[06:51:01] <dubphil> Hello, I Try to make a scrolling div (in fact a fixed position div) to stop being fixed when it reach the footer of the page, but the div is directly at the bottom, although nothing in the css explain this behavior (in firebug) can you help me please ? here is the url of the site : http://bibouille.net/?category/LeMag
[06:51:28] <Cork> dannNiel: yup $(document).on('load', function() { $(window).trigger('scroll') }); would work
[06:51:50] <dannNiel> Cork: after the lazyload() call=
[06:51:53] <dannNiel> ?
[06:52:07] <Cork> yes
[06:52:18] <Cork> if you do it after the call you don't need the load event listner
[06:53:46] <dannNiel> Cork: I've added it to JS, but it doesn't work
[06:54:08] <nFFF> MoneY_, yes
[06:54:12] <nFFF> theres a native method
[06:54:17] <nFFF> urlencode()
[06:54:22] <nFFF> ?mdn urlencode
[06:54:38] <Cork> dannNiel: can't really tell what the code is doing as its minimized
[06:54:49] <nFFF> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/encodeURIComponent
[06:55:09] <Cork> dannNiel: but you need to run $(window).trigger('scroll'); after you've bound the lazyload, and after the page has loaded
[06:55:27] <termite> dubphil: #sidebar is to big
[06:55:43] <termite> it's shifting to the next line
[06:56:01] <dannNiel> Cork: I added the trigger but nothing happens
[06:56:20] <Cork> dannNiel: can't help you more then that
[06:56:23] <bot-t> nFFF, Couldn't find "mdn urlencode" in jQuery Docs.
[06:56:34] <dannNiel> Cork: here is the source: https://raw.github.com/tuupola/jquery_lazyload/master/jquery.lazyload.js
[06:56:50] <dannNiel> Cork: the layload demo works, only on my page the plugin doesn't load the already visible images
[06:56:56] <Cork> dannNiel: thats the plugin
[06:57:16] <termite> dubphil: there are a number of html and css issue also (but that could be you are playing around with it)
[06:58:31] <Cork> dannNiel: hmm the plugin already triggers a scroll event, so that shouldn't be needed
[06:58:42] <Cork> dannNiel: so its something with how/when your loading it
[06:59:20] <dannNiel> Cork: it works great if i scroll 1px; maybe i should scroll the page 1px on load
[06:59:35] <Cork> yes cause that generates a scroll event
[06:59:52] <Cork> so does $(window).trigger('scroll');
[07:00:10] <Cork> so your missing the event the plugin is built to generate for some reason
[07:00:29] <dubphil> termite: you mean too wide ?
[07:01:07] <dannNiel> Cork: strange
[07:01:25] <termite> dubphil: the width and margin are wider then the container so it's dropping down.  I changed the values ad it starts at the top
[07:02:11] <dannNiel> Cork: I've added $('html, body').animate({scrollTop: '1px'});, now it works
[07:02:24] <Cork> uh...
[07:02:25] <dannNiel> not the best solution but enough to get the script work
[07:02:39] <Cork> dannNiel:  $(window).trigger('scroll'); is all you need
[07:02:41] <Cork> it works
[07:03:00] <dannNiel> i have already added $(window).trigger('scroll'); it does not work
[07:03:01] <Cork> but as you won't show the code we can't help you
[07:04:12] <starpile> Can anyone help me to grok multiple simultaneous downloads... As I understand it, the idea is to queue the file hrefs as src attributes on an iframe, but what "triggers" the download.... I don't really understand the exact mechanism here...
[07:04:15] <dubphil> termite : you are right, in fact I don't need margin-left at all
[07:04:48] <dannNiel> Cork: Thats the script compressor of CMS
[07:04:48] <Cork> starpile: you limit the number of connections per user server side
[07:05:04] <Cork> starpile: so you only let the user x downloads at a time
[07:05:14] <Cork> the rest is queued
[07:05:29] <dannNiel> Cork: http://pastebin.com/b5CLwhfc
[07:07:54] <starpile> Cork: how is the download triggered?
[07:08:04] <dubphil> termite : so now it appears well at the top but unfortunately the javascript doesn't work
[07:08:16] <Cork> starpile: triggered?
[07:08:37] <Cork> starpile: by you creating an iframe and pointing it to the download file
[07:09:28] <termite> dubphil: why don't you just change sidebar to position:fixed  seems easier then to onscroll
[07:10:15] <Cork> starpile: hmm looks like your already in the load event and thats why the code doesn't work
[07:10:24] <termite> If I am understanding what you are trying to do correctly
[07:10:42] <Cork> starpile: try setTimeout(function() { $(window).trigger('scroll'); }, 0);
[07:10:50] <Cork> opps wrong nick
[07:11:07] <Cork> dannNiel: the last two lines was for you
[07:12:19] <MoneY_> is $.post asynchron or synchron?
[07:12:20] <dannNiel> Cork: thank you, works great
[07:12:30] <Cork> MoneY_: async
[07:12:46] <Cork> MoneY_: everything that uses events or touch the network is async
[07:12:49] <MoneY_> is there an obtion to toggle?
[07:13:05] <NoiseEee> MoneY_: no, you learn how to use callbacks or promises
[07:13:07] <Cork> MoneY_: you don't want it async
[07:13:32] <Cork> MoneY_: if you make it async, the page will hang until the server responds or until the connection times out
[07:13:39] <_ikke_> Cork: You mean sync
[07:13:47] <Cork> _ikke_: no i mean async
[07:14:00] <_ikke_> Cork: Makes no sense
[07:14:01] <Cork> sync means the following line won't execute until the pref is done
[07:14:09] <_ikke_> yes
[07:14:10] <Cork> *prev
[07:14:15] <MoneY_> Cork, $.ajax understands async:false. i love async request, but: i want to run about 2k posts in a few seconds. i guess my browser will run out of memory due to run it parallel...
[07:14:32] <_ikke_> Cork: so async requests don't make the browser hang, sync requests do
[07:14:58] <Cork> _ikke_: ah lol i wrote wrong in that line, true
[07:15:00] <SparK_BR> MoneY_ memory will be consumed on the server
[07:15:08] <Cork> i missed that completely :)
[07:15:25] <ajpiano> if you do 2000 simultaneous requests, your browser will freeze whether or not you do async: true or false
[07:15:31] <Cork> and ya, two post of 2kb is nothing for the browser
[07:15:42] <Cork> the server will most likely block it though
[07:15:51] <dubphil> termite it was what I did, but if the window is not widely open, the sidebar is overlapping the footer : look I have put the old code
[07:16:32] <Cork> MoneY_: what you prob want to do is dacy-chain the post calls
[07:16:51] <Cork> MoneY_: so that you only ever do one or two at a time
[07:17:10] <fRAiLtY-> I'm quite new to jQuery, and whilst what I've got is working fine, I can't help but think it can be lighter-weight or better written. Can anyone provide some tips or do some "trimming" here? http://jsfiddle.net/7a3K3/
[07:17:25] <MoneY_> yea o_O cant damage my database by 2k request of creating products depences on >10 tables and download/edit pictures of 3 of a product
[07:17:41] <MoneY_> i need to run it one after another...
[07:18:09] <termite> dubphil: set a min_width on the container
[07:19:38] <Cork> MoneY_: http://jsfiddle.net/NrZ5Z/
[07:19:43] <Cork> something like that
[07:20:05] <Cork> that even lets you make a progressbar that you can animate while its working
[07:20:20] <MoneY_> pretty nice, thanks :D
[07:20:22] <Cork> ugg its i < data
[07:20:33] <Cork> warning thats psudo code :)
[07:20:39] <Cork> but you should get the idea
[07:21:16] <NoiseEee> MoneY_: again, 2000 requests reeks of a terrible approach to whatever you're doing, and you should rethink your approach
[07:21:33] <Cork> true
[07:21:49] <Cork> your prob sending more overhead then data doing it that way
[07:22:49] <MoneY_> well, thats why ive tried at first. but i cant send a array of objects via $.post
[07:22:59] <Cork> sure you can
[07:23:07] <Cork> theres multiple ways to do so
[07:23:16] <MoneY_> and i cant assign and object 0 or 1 key
[07:23:20] <MoneY_> how to?
[07:23:40] <Cork> $.post('url', { arr: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9] });
[07:24:24] <Cork> that makes it into a query array though so that will be quite long
[07:24:25] <allX> hi, i extended the jquery.ui tabs using widgetfatory, but binding events does not work anymore when using a type.
[07:24:29] <termite> MoneY_: are you trying to automate data entry or do some automated test?
[07:24:32] <Cork> alternatively you can json encode it
[07:24:53] <allX> so this does not work : $( ".selector" ).bind( "tabsselect", function(event, ui) {   ... });
[07:25:24] <allX> but this does work : $( ".selector" ).tabs({    select: function(event, ui) { ... } });
[07:28:10] <termite> allX: you set a break point and you know the anonymous function is being called?
[07:28:28] <termite> or isn't
[07:28:46] <MoneY_> Cork, ive got [{a:1},{a:2}]. is there a method to use: ['a=1','a=2'] instance of ?
[07:29:18] <Cork> MoneY_: no
[07:29:46] <MoneY_> or: ['{a;1}','{a:2}'] ?
[07:29:54] <MoneY_> or: ['{a:1}','{a:2}'] ?
[07:29:56] <nFFF> You can use objec twithin an object
[07:30:08] <nFFF> { { } { } }
[07:30:24] <Cork> ?eval JSON.stringify([{a:1},{a:2}])
[07:30:25] <MoneY_> can i push new items to an object?
[07:30:27] <bot-t> Cork: "[{\"a\":1},{\"a\":2}]"
[07:30:30] <Cork> you can get that
[07:30:45] <Cork> ?eval $.params({ list: JSON.stringify([{a:1},{a:2}]) })
[07:30:45] <bot-t> Cork: TypeError: $.params is not a function
[07:30:49] <Cork> ?eval $.param({ list: JSON.stringify([{a:1},{a:2}]) })
[07:30:50] <bot-t> Cork: "list=%5B%7B%22a%22%3A1%7D%2C%7B%22a%22%3A2%7D%5D"
[07:31:16] <nFFF> ?eval var x = { a : { 1 : 1, 2 : 2} }; a.1
[07:31:17] <bot-t> nFFF: SyntaxError: missing ; before statement
[07:31:21] <Cork> MoneY_: not push, but you can add
[07:31:23] <Shilon> can anyone help me?
[07:31:33] <Cork> ?ask @ Shilon
[07:31:33] <bot-t> Shilon, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[07:31:47] <Shilon> I did already lol
[07:32:02] <Cork> for for the like last 3 screens here
[07:32:26] <Shilon> I'm using masonry query + a tab script
[07:32:35] <Cork> ah that was you
[07:32:39] <Shilon> yes
[07:32:43] <Shilon> the active tab
[07:32:44] <Cork> did you check what termite asked?
[07:32:46] <Shilon> works fine
[07:32:57] <Shilon> but when I change tabs
[07:33:01] <Cork> uh... no
[07:33:03] <Shilon> the masonry doesn't work
[07:33:14] <Shilon> I'm not that good with jquery
[07:33:30] <Shilon> so I don't know if its possible to reload masonry script when reloading tabs
[07:33:40] <Shilon> or it's there a better way to do that
[07:33:47] <Cork> ok, never used masonry so donno
[07:33:53] <Shilon> hum...
[07:34:27] <Cork> Shilon: if the script is written poorly, your out of luck
[07:34:46] <Shilon> is it better for me to upload the files
[07:34:49] <Cork> if it provides a way to trigger it (like it REALLY should have) it should be in its docs
[07:34:50] <Shilon> and show them to you?
[07:35:02] <Cork> you could give it a try
[07:35:03] <Cork> ?p
[07:35:04] <MoneY_> Cork thanks. $.param works nice. i just json decode it on backend :-)
[07:35:04] <bot-t> Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[07:35:19] <Cork> MoneY_: no need, jquery ajax does that by default
[07:35:33] <Cork> MoneY_: what i showed you was to show what ajax sends
[07:35:42] <Cork> ?eval $.param({ list: JSON.stringify([{a:1},{a:2}]) })
[07:35:42] <bot-t> Cork: "list=%5B%7B%22a%22%3A1%7D%2C%7B%22a%22%3A2%7D%5D"
[07:35:58] <Cork> is what $.post('url', { list: JSON.stringify([{a:1},{a:2}]) })
[07:36:02] <Cork> sends to the server
[07:36:18] <MoneY_> alright. thanks
[07:37:11] <allX> @termite yes everything is working, i tested it with a basic setup, specifically i extended jquery tabs and i wanted to use rotate
[07:37:31] <allX> for testing i removed all my code except the _create function
[07:37:48] <allX> which does nothing except this._tabify(true)
[07:38:58] <allX> when i init the tabs, they are working even rotate once but then they stop, i figured out the bug has to to with this call in the rotate funtion: this.element.bind( "tabsshow", rotate );
[07:39:33] <allX> so i guess i have to pass the type somehow to my extended tabs
[07:40:14] <Shilon> done
[07:40:23] <Shilon> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/Qzmrz/
[07:40:40] <DukeDrake> marf
[07:40:54] <Shilon> subscription tab works good
[07:41:27] <Shilon> the first pots of trending tab has another on on top
[07:47:01] <dubphil> termite: what do you min the "container" ? is it the #sidebar or the #contenu ? and what should play a min_width, do you mean min_height ?
[07:48:22] <dubphil> anyone can help to make the sidebar not overlap my footer ? http://bibouille.net/?category/LeMag
[07:50:39] <Shilon> dubphil: float left on left side, float right on sidebar container then inside that you put your fixed div
[07:50:50] <Shilon> your right div has no float..
[07:52:10] <dubphil> Shilon: ho yes you are right
[07:52:22] <ntry> Hey, i am trying to get the offset of the body tag. Any ideas how to do that?
[07:52:40] <SparK_BR> $("body").offset()?
[07:52:50] <ntry> sadly not working
[07:53:11] <ntry> Note: jQuery does not support getting the offset coordinates of hidden elements or accounting for borders, margins, or padding set on the body element.
[07:53:15] <starsinmypockets> Ug... getting this error Uncaught TypeError: Object [object DOMWindow] has no method 'createDocumentFragment'  http://dpaste.org/gadpC/
[07:53:52] <SparK_BR> ntry, body offset is always 0 0
[07:54:06] <Shilon> I'm trying to change the tabs and continue with masonry script active in all tabs http://jsfiddle.net/Qzmrz/
[07:54:17] <ntry> xkcd.com uses a special (ugly) way to center the page by positioning the body ‚Ä¶ so its not 0 0
[07:55:18] <SparK_BR> ntry, try $("#hack").parent().offset();
[07:55:53] <SparK_BR> just like we did with Flash's Stage camera._parent._x and camera._parent._y
[08:02:25] <Shilon> I'm trying to change the tabs and continue with masonry script active in all tabs http://jsfiddle.net/Qzmrz/
[08:04:44] <ntry> SparK_BR: also not working. xkcd's body has a position left with 50% and a negative margin-left with the half width
[08:05:10] <ntry> but offset only returns the value of the negative margin-left
[08:09:07] <mib_mib> hi guys, i'm creating a google chrome extension that uses jquery to search for words on the current page. I need to search through a wordbank of like 5000 words to see if any of them are on the page, but i'm worried about speed - what is the best way to do this? build a complex regex?
[08:12:00] <zafu> hi, how do I listen for an ESC key event?
[08:12:02] <[fields]> can a jqxhr send a file?
[08:13:32] <_ikke_> [fields]: No
[08:14:09] <[fields]> _ikke_: is there any alternative for an "elegant", "handled" upload?
[08:14:17] <_ikke_> [fields]: flash or java
[08:15:02] <[fields]> _ikke_:  i'm focusing on a phonegap app
[08:15:05] <[fields]> zafu: http://api.jquery.com/keypress/
[08:15:21] <zafu> thanks
[08:15:26] <[fields]> zafu:  ESC character is char code 27, I think
[08:15:48] <firedfox> [fields], consider html5 file upload
[08:15:49] <zafu> oki
[08:16:22] <M3kH> Hi to all!
[08:16:56] <M3kH> I have one problem with jquery in IE8
[08:18:07] <M3kH> I print a list on php both in ie8 I show <li jQuery17208491613134009582="1">
[08:18:21] <M3kH> something have idea why?
[08:19:01] <_ikke_> M3kH: Maybe if you show some code
[08:19:25] <jeffsmykil> Anyone worked with Atom in the past?
[08:19:55] <M3kH> this is the acton is binding there $("#avaiable-user li").bind("click", function() {
[08:19:56] <M3kH> 			email = $(this).find(".email").html();
[08:19:57] <M3kH> 			$("#search-user").val(email);
[08:19:58] <M3kH> 			$(".user-assign .clear").show();
[08:19:59] <M3kH> 			$(".user-assign .approve").show();
[08:20:00] <M3kH> 		});
[08:20:51] <zafu> for an input type=submit should I use click()?
[08:21:27] <M3kH> submit();
[08:21:32] <firedfox> mib_mib, make all your 5000 words attributes of some object, such as var words = { 'word0':1, 'word1':1, ... }; use a loop to do that. then search is quite easy.
[08:22:03] <M3kH> _ikke_: do u have idea?
[08:22:26] <termite> ?demo
[08:22:27] <bot-t> Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[08:25:07] <starsinmypockets> Maybe someone can help with this: http://dpaste.org/NLP2d/
[08:25:41] <starsinmypockets> The hrefs are right in console.log however, I get Object [object DOMWindow] has no method 'createDocumentFragment' error
[08:26:01] <starsinmypockets> Am I missing something here?
[08:28:32] <starsinmypockets> I guess my question is - trying to use iframes to trigger multiple downloads - but how do I insert the iframes into the DOM such that the browser starts the downloads?
[08:28:52] <termite> $('a.multi-download-item').each(function (i,v ) {
[08:28:52] <termite> 		console.log($(v).attr('href'));
[08:30:17] <M3kH> I put the problem here
[08:30:18] <M3kH> http://jsbin.com/edajek/2/
[08:30:46] <M3kH> with ie8 append to li <li jQuery17208491613134009582="1">
[08:30:50] <M3kH> why?
[08:31:35] <_ikke_> M3kH: Where do you get that?
[08:32:49] <M3kH> _ikke_:  I don't understand sorry, wath you mind with "that"?
[08:33:19] <_ikke_> append to li <li jQuery17208491613134009582="1">
[08:34:17] <M3kH> when you open the page of example I send with IE8 you see the problem
[08:34:57] <termite> M3kH: are you trying to do this? $("li[jQuery17208491613134009582='1']").append(something)
[08:35:18] <termite> I am taking a shot in the dark I don't understand your problem
[08:35:54] <M3kH> this is my code http://jsbin.com/edajek/2/edit
[08:36:00] <starsinmypockets> termite - that works to output the hrefs, but how do I force the browser download?
[08:36:50] <M3kH> when I open the page with IE8 the query change my list and add the tag jQuery17....
[08:39:09] <termite> are you trying to download files or json?
[08:39:55] <M3kH> I have just this render list but I found the problem was in the .find() function for IE8
[08:41:32] <termite> starsinmypockets: you can use window.open or an iframe
[08:42:07] <termite> starsinmypockets: you can do it via ajax but you need to make some changes to you server code
[08:42:07] <mib_mib> firedfox: i agree its easy, but its fairly slow no?
[08:48:04] <firedfox> check this: https://gist.github.com/3776635
[08:49:00] <firedfox> searching 100000 words on my old 2010 macbook costs about 250ms
[08:52:24] <firedfox> it just costs about 10ms when run in jsfiddle. wow. nice server
[08:53:28] <_ikke_> jsfiddle runs in your browser :-/
[08:55:45] <firedfox> really?
[08:56:02] <Gho5t> lol
[08:56:16] <firedfox> so what's the difference between running in jsfiddle and in chrome developer console?
[08:56:32] <[knight01]> hi
[08:56:37] <firedfox> great performance difference
[08:56:38] <[knight01]> http://jsfiddle.net/8fMZx/2/
[08:56:48] <[knight01]> looking for help in why that doesn't work in jsfiddle
[08:56:52] <[knight01]> works as intended in ffox
[08:56:56] <[knight01]> breaks in chrome
[08:57:06] <[knight01]> supposed to highlight editable text as you click on it
[08:57:15] <[knight01]> after hitting enter, it removes the content editable switch
[08:57:49] <_ikke_> firedfox: It might be that the developer console isn't as optimized as much
[09:00:09] <firedfox> _ikke_, sounds reasonable. thanks!
[09:00:11] <firedfox> so no need to worry about the performance problem any more
[09:01:32] <[knight01]> wait it works now what did i do lol
[09:04:27] <peterschmidler> Hi. I have a resize function that trigger an animation. Since the resize function is triggered several time the animation is processed several times, too. How can I fire the animation only once at the end of the resize?
[09:04:50] <kwerle> Is there a way to $.load or $.get a selection from a page without loading all the IMG resources listed on that page?
[09:05:47] <pachet> peterschmidler: just have each resize clear and reset a timeout that then does your animation
[09:07:34] <pachet> var timer = null; $(window).on('resize.foo', function ( ) { clearTimeout(timer); timer = setTimeout(do_animation, 200);}); function do_animation ( ) {  /* animate your stuff */ }
[09:07:38] <pachet> peterschmidler^
[09:09:32] <peterschmidler> pachet: Thx.
[09:10:39] <pachet> kwerle: with $.load, no, but with $.get, yes. you can fetch the markup as text, strip out all the image tags, and then insert it into the dom
[09:10:42] <Shilon> I'm trying to change the tabs and continue with masonry script active in all tabs http://jsfiddle.net/Qzmrz/
[09:11:01] <pachet> or you can do smart things like replacing the img src with some preloaded asset, and storing the src for that tag in a data- attribute for later
[09:11:32] <kwerle> it's not that I want to strip 'em.  Hmm.  Adding more JS to deal with it‚Ä¶  It's a thought.
[09:11:55] <kwerle> Thanks for the ideas, anyway.
[09:26:13] <thomasgriffin> Let's say I've got 10 items in my object that I want to loop over - how would I go about looping over the first two, then the last two, and then everything inbetween starting from the third item?
[09:26:40] <Gho5t> just loop over them and check the index
[09:26:52] <Gho5t> or access them using the index in the firs tplace
[09:30:10] <thomasgriffin> guess it could be that easy
[09:30:20] <NoiseEee> thomasgriffin: for what its worth, if you're talking a real JS object, there is no 'order' that you should depend on.
[09:30:34] <NoiseEee> thomasgriffin: if order is important, use an array of objects or another means.
[09:31:17] <thomasgriffin> NoiseEee it's not necessarily important, but it prevents possible UX issues
[09:31:41] <NoiseEee> well the fact that you are suggesting an order makes me think its important, i just wanted to give you a head up.
[09:32:12] <thomasgriffin> it's for a gallery of images that you can rotate through - I want to preload the first two, then the last two so that should a user decide to start to move to the end first, they won't be alarmed when no image is yet present
[09:33:00] <NoiseEee> i'd use an array to hold the images, and http://api.jquery.com/eq/ or http://api.jquery.com/index/ to get where you want quickly
[09:33:37] <termite> thomasgriffin:  just bind to the onload  of the image
[09:34:15] <thomasgriffin> termite you can't do that properly with preloading because of how browsers cache images
[09:35:30] <termite> thomasgriffin: I have done it in the past with no problem.  Just create an array of image names and load them in one at a time
[09:35:54] <thomasgriffin> here is my code: http://pastebin.com/3xE3yvpz
[09:36:02] <thomasgriffin> this is inside the window.load event
[09:36:15] <thomasgriffin> slider is the slider object
[09:36:55] <boaz> if you're having trouble with your jqueries try listening to this, it'll really get you going!: http://soundcloud.com/griz
[09:37:55] <thomasgriffin> NoiseEee here is my code: http://pastebin.com/3xE3yvpz
[09:39:10] <NoiseEee> thomasgriffin: i've never worked with slider, but i presume my_images already is an array of objects?
[09:39:57] <NoiseEee> thomasgriffin: if so, get the length, and use http://api.jquery.com/index/ to get the last two items
[09:40:20] <pachet> ?eval var pokemon = { pikachu : 'raichu', squirtle : 'wartortle', bulbasaur : 'ivysaur', charmander : 'charmeleon', eevee : 'vaporeon', weedle : 'kakuna' }, names = Object.keys(pokemon); ([]).concat(names.splice(0,2), names.splice(-2,2), names) @ thomasgriffin
[09:40:25] <bot-t> thomasgriffin: TypeError: Object.keys is not a function
[09:40:48] <pachet> well then :[
[09:44:13] <thomasgriffin> NoiseEee this is what the console looks like: http://pastebin.com/gaf2SGmD
[09:44:21] <thomasgriffin> just one object with items inside of it
[09:44:32] <NoiseEee> thats an array of images.
[09:45:00] <NoiseEee> so just use array-based methods to get the first-two/last-two and go to town
[09:45:56] <thomasgriffin> which is faster - get, eq or index?
[09:46:13] <mowol> why doesnt this work: <span class="heading" onclick="$(function() { $(this).next(".expand").toggle(1); $(".filterprice").slideToggle(500); });"> ? :)
[09:46:24] <NoiseEee> you don't need to worry about it thomasgriffin really
[09:46:36] <NoiseEee> choose the syntax you like best / results in less code written,
[09:46:45] <thomasgriffin> I prefer eq
[09:47:14] <pifantastic> mowol: probably because you have nested double quotes
[09:47:44] <pifantastic> so the *actual* markup you have is <span class="heading" onclick="$(function() { $(this).next(">
[09:48:05] <mowol> pifantastic: which should be?
[09:48:18] <pifantastic> mowol: you shouldn't have any javascript in your HTML
[09:48:18] <pachet> mowol: why are you using inline event attributes with jquery?
[09:48:26] <pachet> ^
[09:48:29] <pifantastic> mowol: put that shit in it's own script
[09:48:50] <mowol> Then i need some function to be able to pass along which class it should use the slideToggle on, because it changes for every span
[09:49:14] <pifantastic> mowol: data-filter="price"
[09:49:37] <pachet> ?g html5 data attributes @ mowol
[09:49:39] <bot-t> mowol, John Resig - HTML 5 data- Attributes - http://ejohn.org/blog/html-5-data-attributes/
[09:49:50] <Dirkos> I have a problem with wrapInner, somehow i causes all my http requests to run twice?
[09:49:55] <thomasgriffin> NoiseEee then what is going to be the best way to handle the attribute checks with each individual one? I'm not sure I follow how this is going to be better than looping and checking the index that way
[09:50:05] <wrapids> http://dpaste.org/81qRb/ is there some blatant issue with this that I'm missing? succses and failure are both doing nothing, complete is working however. (ignore the break; please) My test.php is simply echo "blah";
[09:50:08] <pachet> eh, not the link i would've pulled, but i guess resig in #jquery is fitting
[09:50:18] <Dirkos> I doing just basic stuff with it though: http://jsfiddle.net/B4wyZ/
[09:51:12] <thomasgriffin> NoiseEee it would seem just as efficient to check $i, e.g. if ( (0 || 1) == $i || (my_images.length || my_images.length - 1 ) == $i )
[09:51:21] <thomasgriffin> NoiseEee would that work well too?
[09:53:38] <mowol> pachet: pifantastic http://jsfiddle.net/RnNfr/
[09:53:44] <NoiseEee> thomasgriffin: tias?  i'm not following to closely.
[09:53:46] <NoiseEee> soo.
[09:53:48] <NoiseEee> er too.
[09:56:03] <thomasgriffin> does this do what I need, or am I understanding wrongly how array traversing works? http://pastebin.com/CqgDANiU
[09:57:02] <thomasgriffin> wouldn't that target the first and last two images first before preloading the rest of them?
[09:57:55] <pifantastic> mowol: just a sec
[09:57:56] <pachet> mowol: http://jsfiddle.net/YrDYz/
[09:58:37] <pachet> my advice, and this is just echoing pifantastic, is to keep javascript the hell out of your markup
[10:00:37] <pifantastic> mowol: pachet beat me to it.
[10:00:52] <pifantastic> but that
[10:00:56] <aboudreault> I'm wondering if there is any things already done for multiple pages complex forms in jquery-mobile?
[10:00:58] <pifantastic> is the better way to solve it
[10:02:13] <AwesomeGarethMan> very quick question - is there a "proper" way to do blocking AJAX calls?
[10:02:33] <pachet> i'd argue that blocking ajax calls are improper by definition
[10:02:45] <pachet> for one, they're no longer A-synchronous-JAX
[10:02:50] <wrapids> http://dpaste.org/81qRb/ is there some blatant issue with this that I'm missing? succses and failure are both doing nothing, complete is working however. (ignore the break; please) My test.php is simply echo "blah";
[10:02:51] <pachet> SJAX maybe
[10:02:53] <AwesomeGarethMan> i just want to grab the results of a GET call to a webservice that returns JSON and do stuff with it without adding callbacks and restructuring stuff and i'm in kind of a rush to get the whole thing working
[10:03:11] <AwesomeGarethMan> so is there some sort of official blocking call in jQuery or do i need to hack up a wrapper?
[10:03:45] <AwesomeGarethMan> pachet: do you know?
[10:04:39] <pachet> AwesomeGarethMan: yeah, just specify the 'async' property on the object literal you pass in to $.ajax
[10:04:57] <pachet> $.ajax({url:'foo', success : function(){}, async : false})
[10:05:12] <pachet> success will fire before execution continues
[10:05:16] <AwesomeGarethMan> will that return the data to the calling function?
[10:05:27] <pachet> no, you still have to handle your login in 'success'
[10:05:34] <pachet> er s/login/logic
[10:05:41] <AwesomeGarethMan> ah
[10:05:51] <AwesomeGarethMan> so i need to hack up a wrapper then
[10:06:05] <AwesomeGarethMan> ok, thanks
[10:06:06] <pachet> i mean, can't you just do something like
[10:06:11] <AwesomeGarethMan> hmm?
[10:06:42] <pachet> var result; $.ajax({url: 'foo', async : false, success : function ( data ) { result = data; }); return result;
[10:06:58] <AwesomeGarethMan> that's just what i was thinking
[10:07:00] <pachet> not very much that you have to wrap, really
[10:07:02] <pachet> ah gotcha
[10:07:54] <pachet> and i understand being under deadline, but the javascript skykittens have a muffin set aside for you whenever you're able to refactor it to not be synchronous :]
[10:08:00] <wrapids> With $.ajax({url:'test', success:function(data){}, failure: function(){}}); isn't one of either success or failure gaurenteed to execute?
[10:09:07] <AwesomeGarethMan> pachet: a muffin?
[10:09:09] <AwesomeGarethMan> for me?
[10:09:57] <pachet> a muffin of self-satisfaction for knowing you're not locking the browser
[10:10:24] <AwesomeGarethMan> ah, now that could be an issue
[10:10:28] <AwesomeGarethMan> locking up the browser UI
[10:14:52] <at[o]m> lu
[10:23:30] <mowol> pachet: thanks, sorry for the late respons, but dinner was ready ;) And this will also work in older browsers with the html 5 involved?
[10:26:46] <pachet> mowol: yeah, that's the reason they chose that convention for data-attributes
[10:27:33] <wrapids> Is the call $.ajax( {url: 'test.php', success: function(data){}}); not correct for getting an echo from a php scrpt?
[10:27:56] <mowol> pachet: i'll take your word for it. Clean solution. Thanks a lot
[10:28:17] <mib_mib> hi guys, need some help - i am loading a google chrome extension the normal way, but qtip.js (http://craigsworks.com/projects/qtip2/demos/ ) is not loading into the page properly - however, when i include it directly on the page it works - can someone help?
[10:28:58] <mib_mib> i.e. if i load it locally through the manifest.js it doesn't seem to then find jQuery.fn.qtip
[10:38:54] <catcher> I'm trying to take the height of an element that contains images without pre-defined heights.  Safari is doing the calculation before the images take up space - how can I get around this?
[10:40:18] <mowol> there should really be some kind of standard with regards to sorting product in a webshop
[10:47:04] <pachet> catcher: wait for the images to load
[10:47:13] <pachet> ?.load
[10:47:14] <bot-t> .load(handler): Bind an event handler to the "load" JavaScript event. http://api.jquery.com/load-event/
[10:48:31] <catcher> pachet, there's a non-fixed amount of images in this element - can I use .load() on a generic selector that will grab them all and keep pumping up the total height?
[10:49:55] <pachet> catcher: em, i'd just see $(window).load
[10:50:05] <pachet> which is a glorified alias for native window.onload
[10:50:13] <pachet> which will wait for images to finish loading before firing
[10:50:21] <catcher> killer, thanks pachet
[10:51:47] <dogmatic69> I am building some charts getting data via ajax. its returned as json similar to {[date, amount, cost, something], [date, amount, cost, something], ....}
[10:52:30] <dogmatic69> I have a button to switch between showing amount, cost, something. What is a good way to store the entire object from json to switch on the fly?
[10:53:05] <dogmatic69> eg: I first render using "date, amount". User can switch to cost wich re draws the chart using "date, cost"
[10:53:53] <dogmatic69> Each chart can show one or more sets of data and there can be thousands of points in each set.
[10:54:11] <dogmatic69> Trying to store it local to avoid having to re ajax the data in all the time
[10:58:46] <mowol> Can i with this http://jsfiddle.net/5aPg7/ somehow get the amount of products visible?
[11:01:04] <hariom> It is not jquery per say problem. But I think js fans can help. I have declared a variable at the top of my js i.e. above the $(document).ready(). It was working as global variable. But after a form submit (non ajax), I see that it is no more a global variable. This JS is accessible through out the site as its part of the base template
[11:04:43] <mowol> figured it out: http://jsfiddle.net/5aPg7/144/
[11:08:11] <MistuhKurtz> hariom, variables do not persist from page load to page load
[11:08:31] <MistuhKurtz> you need to use javascript to POST data to the server if you want that
[11:09:21] <wachpwnski> can anyone explain a javascript function for me?
[11:11:13] <hariom> MistuhKurtz: I am submitting a form that is a post request. After this post request response, I don't find that variable has the value I set it to before the form submit
[11:11:17] <wachpwnski> https://gist.github.com/26c03f4d5d2f0dee9637 I don't get what that is doing exactly.
[11:11:44] <MistuhKurtz> hariom, because it's non-AJAX
[11:16:51] <dogmatic69> ajpiano: you about today?
[11:20:25] <Gho5t> you bout it bout
[11:26:12] <hariom> MistuhKurtz: But as the post response comes, page will refresh and $(document).ready will be called again, so it should automatically fill the variables again by firing the first ajax again
[11:26:49] <MistuhKurtz> I can't say what's going on without taking a look
[11:26:59] <MistuhKurtz> try logging the var at various points hariom
[11:30:01] <hemanth_> which is best way to say : jquery when element is visible....do....
[11:37:40] <MistuhKurtz> hemanth_, there's a :visible selector
[11:38:01] <MistuhKurtz> you can also use $(el).is(':visible');
[11:38:27] <hemanth_> MistuhKurtz, but that wont wait till visible, right?
[11:38:44] <MistuhKurtz> I don't follow.
[11:38:51] <MistuhKurtz> oh
[11:39:00] <MistuhKurtz> you're going to need to execute that code in a function that's bound to an event
[11:39:16] <hemanth_> MistuhKurtz, try this http://bookurevent.com/ click on signup today
[11:39:50] <hemanth_> again on click of Get started, nothing happens
[11:40:15] <MistuhKurtz> so, bind an event to the get started button?
[11:40:24] <MistuhKurtz> You don't have a <form> tag
[11:40:27] <hemanth_> MistuhKurtz, yes have done that
[11:40:44] <MistuhKurtz> hemanth_, if you want to isolate your problem on a jsfiddle then i can help
[11:40:49] <MistuhKurtz> I don't have time otherwise, sry
[11:41:08] <hemanth_> MistuhKurtz, hang on, no form tag btw
[11:41:26] <MistuhKurtz> You need the <form> tag
[11:41:56] <hemanth_> MistuhKurtz, http://jsfiddle.net/nkKdg/ is what i have done, why?
[11:43:31] <hemanth_> MistuhKurtz, same with the from tag
[11:43:54] <eziob> anyone know how i can move an element to another element and still keep all the events and such?
[11:47:37] <eziob> i farted
[11:47:38] <eziob> sorry
[11:49:34] <MistuhKurtz> eziob, there's an argument you can pass to clone() iirc
[11:49:46] <MistuhKurtz> to keep all the events bound
[11:49:48] <eziob> my hero
[11:50:19] <MistuhKurtz> hemanth_, you need to add the HTML markup and any needed CSS
[11:50:23] <MistuhKurtz> to get the demo fully running
[11:50:25] <hemanth_> MistuhKurtz, http://bookurevent.com/ no form needed
[11:50:44] <MistuhKurtz> hemanth_, you need a <form> tag
[11:50:44] <hemanth_> MistuhKurtz, fixed, it's working :)
[11:50:48] <hemanth_> why?
[11:51:07] <MistuhKurtz> because it's malformed otherwise
[11:52:12] <mib_mib> has anyone made a google chrome extension before? I can't get this javascript to load properly as a content script (i'm loading it the regular way in my manifest.json) https://github.com/Craga89/qTip2/tree/master/dist
[11:52:31] <hemanth_> MistuhKurtz, while doing an ajax request you mean?
[11:53:36] <hemanth_> MistuhKurtz, AFK for a while, thanks will check on malformed stuff
[11:56:38] <NoiseEee> ?mlu
[11:56:38] <bot-t> much like urself

[12:14:20] <sypris> jaequery: http://pastebin.com/Tiw7ed0J  it loads the first time on the toggle.  After that I can't close the toggle.  I don't think I understand the order of operations well enough here
[12:16:23] <jaequery_> whats .popover
[12:16:24] <louism2_> Hey everyone, I am having issues with a "mouseover" event only firing the first time the event is triggered and then not firing on subsequent mouseovers

[12:17:21] <eziob> nerds unite
[12:17:27] <eziob> i have a question
[12:17:35] <eziob> which needs the collective minds of nerds
[12:17:44] <eziob> damnit j_wright_
[12:17:47] <eziob> bout to stap you
[12:17:52] <eziob> k nerds
[12:17:55] <eziob> what is the name
[12:17:57] <eziob> of the chick
[12:18:01] <eziob> who runs the animus
[12:18:51] <louism2_> sypris: what is popover?
[12:18:59] <sypris> it's from twitter-bootstrap
[12:19:42] <louism2_> sypris: what does it do?
[12:20:03] <sypris> creates a tooltip style window
[12:21:32] <louism2_> how are you closing it?
[12:21:45] <louism2_> or attempting to close it?
[12:22:00] <sypris> I assumed the ('toggle') was closing it
[12:22:09] <mmealling> nevermind... I definitely AM an idiot....
[12:31:25] <louism2_> sypris: without know anything about the bootstrap methods I would assume that toggle is failing
[12:31:25] <louism2_> try explicity opening and closing it rather than using toggle
[12:31:26] <TimRiker> jeditable shows the raw html but allows <> to be entered. If they are in the return string on post, html is interpreted and NOT escaped. Thus return should NOT have <>, but on next edit &lt;&gt; will be seen in edit and NOT the original <> that was entered. Is this expected behaviour?
[12:31:26] <sypris> how would I differentiate each click?
[12:31:26] <TimRiker> I would think that html would be decoded before edit (so it looks like what was displayed) and then encoded after post/get so that the user actually sees what was sent instead of allowing the browser to render it.
[12:31:26] <TimRiker> there is a loadurl call in jeditable to get field contents before edit from a url. I'd like to see a loadfunction that just does an html render.
[12:31:26] <louism2_> you could also try binding a click element to that tooltip window
[12:31:26] <louism2_> sorry click event
[12:31:26] <TimRiker> is there another in-place edit interface that I should be using instead of jeditable? preferably one that handles <> in the edit box.
[12:31:27] <mowol> how do i find all objects that has an id of #slider-range-XXXX where XXXX is different for every object?
[12:31:27] <RabSimpson> nobody?
[12:32:33] <atula> RabSimpson, ?
[12:33:11] <TimRiker> mowol, http://api.jquery.com/attribute-starts-with-selector/
[12:33:12] <RabSimpson> atula ever set up a custom modal dialogue using fancybox? i'm a noob with this stuff and i'm not sure where to start. i've got the fancybox js loaded using the fancybox for wordpress plugin.
[12:34:10] <atula> RabSimpson, that's a pretty tough question to ask people. It's like‚Ä¶ I don't know what to do, help. That's not going to cut it.  If you have specific question, you can always ask.  Asking someone to give you a tutorial in a short time is a bit tough.
[12:34:14] <RabSimpson> atula i've added the alternative part from section 6 here: http://fancybox.net/blog but nothing is happening when i load the page.
[12:34:36] <mowol> TimRiker:  perfect: http://jsfiddle.net/d46VN/ thanks
[12:34:42] <atula> RabSimpson, is there error‚Ä¶ what's not working?
[12:34:45] <RabSimpson> atula my questions tend to involve a bit of extra explanation so it can take a while to type it all
[12:35:01] <RabSimpson> atula it's just not doing anything, not seeing any errors
[12:35:17] <atula> RabSimpson, is there a page we can look at?
[12:35:35] <RabSimpson> gimme a sec, i'll duplicate it because it's behind a login
[12:35:41] <TimRiker> mowol, $("[id^=slider-range-]")  should do ya
[12:35:55] <mowol> TimRiker:  thanks :)
[12:36:11] <TimRiker> np
[12:36:31] <mowol> TimRiker: can i somehow make a single exception to this selector though? If the entire id is something special
[12:37:46] <ecky--ptang-zoob> I'm trying to configure the jquery ui themeroller, but when I change the values, it doesn't update anything on the right... what could be the problem?
[12:38:28] <RabSimpson> atula here we go: http://www.bbnglasgow.com/fancybox-modal.htm
[12:38:36] <TimRiker> mowol, something like this might work: div[id^="slider-"][id!="slider-1a"]
[12:38:56] <atula> RabSimpson, there are two errors right off the bat
[12:39:05] <atula> what browser are you using to develop?
[12:39:18] <atula> are you using console/firebug or anything of that sort?
[12:40:34] <RabSimpson> i've just started on this issue so i've been trying it out with safari, still getting my feet wet with fancybox
[12:46:07] <pnoexz> hey, im using $('a').bind('click',function(){foo()}).. how can i pass to foo() the element that was clicked?
[12:46:07] <goddard> I'm trying to have a value i my text box if it is empty
[12:46:07] <goddard> i thought this would work but it isn't
[12:46:07] <goddard> onblur="if(this.value==''){this.value='First Name';}"
[12:46:08] <RabSimpson> atula i'll fire it up in firefox so i can see what you're seeing, i've got firebug
[12:46:08] <pnoexz> goddard: use the placeholder attribute instead
[12:46:08] <ecky--ptang-zoob> I changed all the pink colors here: http://jqueryui.com/themeroller/ - to orange... but it still shows as pink :(
[12:46:09] <goddard> pnoexz: not familar with that
[12:46:10] <pnoexz> goddard: now its a good time to look it up, it is html5 though
[12:46:10] <goddard> oh
[12:46:10] <RabSimpson> atula interesting, there doesn't appear to be a reason for those errors (although there definitely is)
[12:46:11] <RabSimpson> atula the part with a.fancybox is generated by the plugin itself
[12:46:11] <goddard> pnoexz: nice that works perfect
[12:46:11] <pnoexz> goddard: but to answer your question, val() is the function that returns the value of a field, i believe theres no attribute called value
[12:46:11] <atula> RabSimpson, what is the shutter bit?
[12:46:11] <goddard> pnoexz: i need to learn more html5 stuff i guess
[12:46:11] <pnoexz> so if (this.val() == '') { this.val('First name') }
[12:46:11] <TimRiker> try adding <> to one of the fields here. Note the popup that an edit added. http://www.appelsiini.net/projects/jeditable/default.html
[12:46:11] <RabSimpson> atula that's another lightbox type thing that nextgen gallery loads in by default
[12:46:12] <RabSimpson> atula i'm not sure if it's possible to remove it
[12:46:12] <RabSimpson> just a sec
[12:46:17] <gx> anyone have any experience with jquery-ui address autocomplete via google maps?
[12:46:55] <gx> for some reason it works fine as long as it's outside any kind of div, but within any of my forms (where it needs to work) the autocomplete isnt working
[12:47:03] <TelFiRE> anyone have experience with jquery backstretch? Any considerations for a responsive layout in which the image I want to fetch is different for each media query?
[12:47:22] <RabSimpson> atula got it out
[12:47:52] <mowol> TimRiker: http://jsfiddle.net/asXtW/ i get a Uncaught TypeError: Cannot set property '0' of null error. Any ideas?
[12:48:38] <mowol> TimRiker: sorry, spelling error in the special case there. Now i get faults with the actual slider :D
[12:50:17] <TimRiker> mowol, now you're over my head. I would think that the $this would relate to the $this you can doing the call from and not to each discovered id. But I'm not sure on that.
[12:50:32] <mowol> TimRiker:  yeah that is the fault ;)
[12:52:26] <mowol> TimRiker: any ideas on how to fix it? :)
[12:52:48] <atula> RabSimpson, there must be something wrong with your syntax. it doesn't make sense to throw off that error. perhaps one of the config is wrong/unexpect
[12:52:51] <TimRiker> not offhand, nope.
[12:54:09] <mowol> ok thanks for your help TimRiker
[12:54:55] <RabSimpson> atula weird. the place where it's reporting the error was copied directly from the fancybox site
[12:54:57] <TimRiker> good luck
[12:55:14] <atula> RabSimpson, start without the config. just go with default/vanilla
[12:55:41] <RabSimpson> atula the part in the braces?
[12:55:51] <atula> yeah
[12:57:28] <RabSimpson> atula the whole script on line 117 i've commented out and it's now throwing errors for the earlier part
[12:57:42] <RabSimpson> atula either the plugin isn't working or it's fighting with something
[12:57:47] <RabSimpson> just a sec
[12:59:27] <madprops> how can I remove all objects attached to a div?
[12:59:45] <Gho5t> $('#foo').remove('div>')
[13:03:19] <pnoexz> hey, im using $('a').bind('click',function(){foo()}).. how can i pass to foo() the element that was clicked?
[13:03:40] <RabSimpson> atula there appears to be a problem with the plugin's own js
[13:03:45] <NoiseEee> pnoexz: new code should be using .on and not .bind
[13:03:52] <RabSimpson> TypeError: t is undefined - http://www.bbnglasgow.com/wp/wp-content/plugins/fancybox-for-wordpress/fancybox/jquery.fancybox.js?ver=1.3.4 - Line 18
[13:04:11] <NoiseEee> pnoexz: but it's the missing argument in function() above
[13:04:19] <NoiseEee> pnoexz: http://api.jquery.com/bind/
[13:04:38] <pnoexz> NoiseEee: i had forgotten about bind being deprecated
[13:05:08] <telna> 'this' always refers to the element in an onclick method
[13:05:43] <NoiseEee> telna: not if you're using delegation, for example
[13:06:23] <pnoexz> oooh, i know what the problem is
[13:06:33] <pnoexz> im using ajax as well
[13:06:54] <pnoexz> so i need on to pass the value to the ajax success call, so i can pass it to foo()
[13:07:05] <pnoexz> i think
[13:13:36] <macmarti_> I am creating a widget where a snippet of code can be placed in a page that will then load content into the div. I'm dynamically checking for the existence of jQuery and if it's not there I load it. It then loads bootstrap. But for some reason an error is thrown in bootstrap when it calls jquery. Bootstrap requires that jQuery is loaded first, and that's what I'm doing so I'm not sure why it fails. If I explicitely add the
[13:13:36] <macmarti_>  tag to include jquery in test.html the dynamic bootstrap load doesn't complain. Any idea what it fails in the first case? https://gist.github.com/3778047
[13:17:27] <jaequery> i got a ft gig 120k+, in LA but remote okay too, pm me if interested
[13:18:06] <macmarti_> ft?
[13:18:26] <jaequery> yes
[13:20:20] <mowol> TimRiker: in case you are interested, this did it: $('[id^="slider-range"]').each(function(){ $(this).slider('values', 0, ($(this).slider('option', 'min'))) });
[13:28:59] <Cameron_> i select a <a> element
[13:29:05] <Cameron_> and next to it is a <br>
[13:29:11] <Cameron_> how do i fine the br?
[13:29:15] <Cameron_> *find the next br
[13:29:48] <NoiseEee> next you say?  http://api.jquery.com/next/
[13:30:25] <timwis> Hey guys, I'm using trying to do a CORS $.ajax() on IE8. I included jquery.xdomain.js and it works sometimes, other times it doesn't appear to be sending the request (looking in Fiddler)
[13:30:33] <timwis> Anyone heard of that?
[13:30:50] <Cameron_> oh thanks NoiseEee
[13:31:25] <TelFiRE> There seem to be a fair number of jQuery pls out there that will let you stretch an image to the page width. However I can't see a way to specify different source images depending on the media query. is there an accepted solution for that?
[13:32:14] <ajpiano> TelFiRE: it's a kind of an evolving space
[13:32:15] <ajpiano> http://css-tricks.com/which-responsive-images-solution-should-you-use/
[13:32:42] <ajpiano> http://www.w3.org/community/respimg/
[13:38:42] <timwis> I'm using trying to do a CORS $.ajax() on IE8. I included jquery.xdomain.js and it works sometimes, other times it doesn't appear to be sending the request (looking in Fiddler). Anyone heard of that?
[13:38:51] <Gho5t> TelFiRE: you could simply toggle images based on the media query
[13:39:39] <TelFiRE> Gho5t: I don't see what you mean toggle them? The jQuery itself puts the image there so it's not like I have elements in the markup at least not until after the jquery runs
[13:39:53] <TelFiRE> and I want the jquery in the first place to pick the right image
[13:48:55] <Gho5t> ah sorry
[13:49:05] <Gho5t> i thought you were just asking for a way to make responsive images
[13:49:18] <mkf> Hi there. I'm searching for a jQuery based scrollbar replacement that doesn't need extra markup. I tried slimScroll, nanoscroller and jScrollPane.
[13:49:18] <Gho5t> but be able to specify the source based on the page with
[13:49:43] <mkf> Btw. I need it for horizontal scrolling. Vertical is not necessary.
[13:49:55] <mkf> And I need mousewheel support.
[13:51:20] <TimRiker> would be nice imho if jeditable had an rawhtml parameter which defaulted to false. when true edited text would be rendered first, then html escaped when saved. this would prohibit including <a> etc. by default.
[13:52:18] <TimRiker> er when false (default) text is rendered, edited, escaped. and when true it's left raw with all the XSS that implies.
[13:53:36] <Gho5t> TelFiRE: honestly I don't know why  you would need  a JS plugin to make something 100% width. Never used one.
[13:53:54] <TelFiRE> Gho5t: because browsers don't support background-size
[13:54:11] <Gho5t> not all yes
[13:54:30] <Gho5t> and who said you needed it to be a bg image
[13:54:37] <Gho5t> actually i'm lost again
[13:54:45] <Gho5t> why do you need background-size
[13:55:08] <TelFiRE> because that's the css property you would use to make it stretch to the page and maintain its aspect ratio
[13:56:03] <TelFiRE> without which css will not scale or adjust the size of the background whatsoever, it will simply clip it
[13:56:20] <TelFiRE> let alone if you're scaling UP, that's a whole nother issue
[13:59:43] <chovy> how come $(".error").removeClass('.error'); doesn't work?
[14:00:28] <chovy> nm
[14:00:39] <chovy> removeClass('error');
[14:03:00] <ryanneufeld> http://www.wimp.com/thewee/
[14:07:07] <firstclassfunc_> how do I perform a non-ajax post with jquery?
[14:08:47] <ryanneufeld> firstclassfunc_: you can call submit() on your form
[14:09:34] <[fields]> ryanneufeld: can a form set to .hide() be .submit() ?
[14:09:35] <firstclassfunc_> it's not really a form.. I just want to submit an array of strings
[14:09:51] <ryanneufeld> [fields]: ?tias
[14:10:02] <ryanneufeld> ?tias @ [fields]
[14:10:03] <bot-t> [fields], Try It And See
[14:10:21] <ryanneufeld> firstclassfunc_: why do you not want ajax?
[14:10:41] <ryanneufeld> firstclassfunc_: are you wanting the page to refresh?
[14:11:15] <ryanneufeld> firstclassfunc_: The only way that I know of is to build a form, and submit it.  You should be able to build a form out of dom fragments and submit it.
[14:11:16] <[fields]> firstclassfunc_: page refresh == submit , remain on page == jqxhr
[14:12:11] <firstclassfunc_> [fields]: yes, I know
[14:13:04] <firstclassfunc_> for an example, I have page1.html and page2.html. each page has its own javascript, I want to load (all of) page 2 after I'm done on page1.
[14:13:30] <ryanneufeld> and you want it to post some data from page 1?
[14:13:46] <ryanneufeld> that would be a simple form
[14:13:53] <firstclassfunc_> yes, either with a form post or with an ajax post
[14:14:09] <ryanneufeld> an ajax post wouldn't reload the page
[14:14:10] <firstclassfunc_> if it's an ajax post, then I want page2 to replace page1, including the scripts. is that easy?
[14:14:29] <ryanneufeld> yeah, but if that's the case a plain old fasioned post is better
[14:14:44] <ryanneufeld> does page2 depend on the data from page1 to function?
[14:14:53] <firstclassfunc_> nope, they're completely separate
[14:14:57] <[fields]> i agree.  page1.html > processing.php > page2.html
[14:15:28] <firstclassfunc_> say I didn't want a traditional post. what are the steps?
[14:15:48] <ryanneufeld> firstclassfunc_: then you can use ajax, and on successful complete you can redirect by changing the window.location
[14:16:15] <[fields]> do a jqxhr, on success - change the way your page looks by manipulating the DOM
[14:16:23] <noahbalboa> I'm trying to catch the 'backstrech.show' event in my code (https://github.com/srobbin/jquery-backstretch#events), but can't figure out how. chaining .bind to the initiation isn't working...
[14:16:52] <[fields]> yes, redirect to page 2 after success of jqxhr is likely most light-weight solution
[14:17:34] <firstclassfunc_> ryanneufeld: alrighty, thanks
[14:18:07] <ryanneufeld> firstclassfunc_: np I suppose
[14:18:44] <ryanneufeld> ?demo @ noahbalboa
[14:18:45] <bot-t> noahbalboa, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[14:21:16] <deshymers1> so I have a button that uses a peice of js to include a iframe in a document. I have 0 control over that js. what I need to do is run some jquery when that iframe is added to the page, is there a way I can attach an event when the iframe is loaded, or put a click event on that button and trigger the default behaviour?
[14:21:21] <jaequery> where can i find the best javascript developers for hire?
[14:23:02] <ryanneufeld> deshymers1: there is a native js method to watch the DOM, but it's very expensive computationally.  What you can do is bind an additional handler to the button, and have that code check for the iframe afterwards.
[14:23:24] <ryanneufeld> jaequery: gainfully employed would be my guess.
[14:23:24] <macmartine> Any idea why this form is submitted with GET instead of POST? Note that it's submitted via the ajax call when a link is clicked https://gist.github.com/3778448
[14:24:05] <deshymers1> ryanneufeld: thats what I figured, so how do I trigger the default action in my event handler?
[14:24:05] <ryanneufeld> macmartine: can you post the JS generated by coffee script?
[14:24:29] <deshymers1> ryanneufeld: you see my message before the netsplit?
[14:24:32] <macmartine> ryanneufeld: Ah! It works if I remove the dataType
[14:25:03] <ryanneufeld> deshymers1: you don't have to, as long as you don't return false, or do an event.stopPropigation()
[14:25:07] <ryanneufeld> macmartine: there you go
[14:25:26] <Induane> I need to use the .each() on elements that have been dynamically added to a page in order to create a selector.  Since the elements were dynamically added they aren't at the dom level. Normally I'd use .on() but that seems only for events and I need to just do collecting as there is no click event triggering this.
[14:25:40] <Induane> Is it possible to get element values from these elements?
[14:26:03] <deshymers1> ryanneufeld: right, but my jquery event handler will fire before the other one
[14:26:26] <ryanneufeld> deshymers1: are you sure?
[14:27:25] <ryanneufeld> Induane: each should work on what ever the jquery collection is. Regardless of when it was added. Now if you built the collection before calling .each() then you've got a race condition
[14:28:26] <deshymers1> ryanneufeld: yes because if it didnt then return false; wouldnt do anything
[14:29:42] <ryanneufeld> deshymers1: I'm not really sure what to suggest
[14:29:57] <deshymers1> hehe ya me either, thats why I came here :P
[14:31:09] <ryanneufeld> is the button code triggered with an onlick?
[14:31:37] <ryanneufeld> like <button onclick="someFunction()">
[14:32:06] <deshymers1> some 3rd party jquery I believe
[14:32:25] <ryanneufeld> hmm
[14:32:38] <deshymers1> let me do some testing, I think I've got a hack that may work
[14:33:00] <Induane> ryanneufeld: well the bit is a collection of both elements that were on the page when it was loaded as well as some dynamically added via user input
[14:33:00] <Induane> all have the same class
[14:33:01] <Induane> however .each skipps the dynamically added ones and only collects the ones that existed at page load time
[14:33:48] <ryanneufeld> ?paste @ Induane
[14:33:48] <bot-t> Induane, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[14:37:12] <Induane> one sec
[14:37:25] <Induane> sorry, got snagged by a sup

[15:12:25] <MXBrandon> Can anyone recommend any good plugins for jquery for making divs resizeable? I want to have something that looks similar to HTML frames, but with DIV
[15:12:54] <ryanneufeld> MXBrandon: checkout jqueryui
[15:13:01] <ryanneufeld> MXBrandon: and the resizable plugin
[15:13:23] <MXBrandon> This plugin has what I am looking for, but it is not very customizeable.  It is designed with their layout in mind and I can't customize or add divs.   http://layout.jquery-dev.net/demos/simple.html
[15:14:27] <MXBrandon> ryanneufeld> Yeah, I saw that, but its not exactly what I am looking for
[15:14:48] <MXBrandon> The URL I posted above is exactly what I want, but they only allow pre-named DIV's and positions for them
[15:15:13] <ryanneufeld> MXBrandon: oh, you want panels
[15:16:23] <MXBrandon> ryanneufeld> Yes
[15:16:42] <ryanneufeld> MXBrandon: they're using jquery ui
[15:16:54] <ryanneufeld> view-source:http://layout.jquery-dev.net/demos/simple.html
[15:17:03] <ryanneufeld> line 69
[15:18:36] <MXBrandon> ryanneufeld:  Correct.  I know it is using jquery UI and if needed I can develop it from the ground up.  But it seems like something that someone would have already done, so I was looking for a plugin similar to theirs, but more customizable
[15:19:48] <ryanneufeld> MXBrandon: Ah, I see, the resizable pretty easy to use, sorry I don't know of a pre-built plugin for this.
[15:20:35] <MXBrandon> OK, I'll just start from scratch then
[15:21:23] <MXBrandon> I've been using jquery for a long time, I am just doing a quick and dirty project for a friend and don;t want to tie up a bunch of time into it.  I was hoping for something out of the box that I could find :)
[15:21:54] <ryanneufeld> Yeah, there might be something out there for you. I just don't personally know of any
[15:30:07] <djsounds02> if I have a h1 that goes onto 2 lines can jQuery detect that second line?
[15:41:35] <arielserafini> djsounds02: maybe you can test for height?
[15:41:56] <jarr0dsz> i have this strange issue a div content replace sometimes work and sometimes not, what could interfear with it?
[15:42:28] <arielserafini> ?demo @ jarr0dsz
[15:42:29] <bot-t> jarr0dsz, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[15:42:30] <djsounds02> arielserafini: well I want to have text align left on the first line  and text align right on the second line..
[15:43:01] <jarr0dsz> cannot demo its part of complex code and runs in realtime, just wondered what could interfear with a ajax load some other part of the page loaded at the same time?
[15:43:02] <arielserafini> djsounds02: I don't think you can do that easily
[15:43:34] <arielserafini> djsounds02: can't you add a span inside the h1 or something?
[15:43:38] <ryanneufeld> djsounds02: how are you making it two lines
[15:43:39] <ryanneufeld> ?
[15:44:38] <ryanneufeld> djsounds02: if you're using a <br> then, no, there is no easy way to get the text in the second line. What you could do is wrap each line in a span, and then get the second span, that would be easy enough
[15:45:08] <arielserafini> ryanneufeld: high five
[15:45:23] <ryanneufeld> ?hi5 @ arielserafini
[15:45:24] <bot-t> arielserafini, ‚ã∞‚Åµ‚ã±
[15:45:31] <arielserafini> haha
[15:46:16] <jarr0dsz> arielserafini: something like this is used to reload http://pastie.org/4794000
[15:46:28] <jarr0dsz> now the strange thing if i have that alert it it does seem to reload portions of dives but without not
[15:46:50] <raj> a jquery.cookie is only good in the browser tab it was sent to, yes?
[15:47:17] <jarr0dsz> raj: think so its browser based but wont work untill your reload the other tabs
[15:47:30] <jarr0dsz> if each tab is on same domain/ app
[15:47:37] <MXBrandon> raj: It will work on the entire domain, but you would have to reload the other page before it would detect it
[15:47:57] <chovy> does $.ajax({ complete: fn }) need to become done: fn: in 1.8?
[15:48:20] <chovy> Deprecation Notice: The jqXHR.success(), jqXHR.error(), and jqXHR.complete() callbacks will be deprecated in jQuery 1.8. To prepare your code for their eventual removal, use jqXHR.done(), jqXHR.fail(), and jqXHR.always() instead.
[15:48:21] <jarr0dsz> this is just crayz, why does my divs reload when i place an alert in my function and not without? hows that even possible
[15:48:43] <ajpiano> chovy: no
[15:48:59] <min|dvir|us> Hi. Is there documentation for instantiating an element like $('<el>', {prop: val})?
[15:49:04] <djsounds02> ryanneufeld: do you mean manually wrap the lines or would jquery do that for me?
[15:49:10] <mfoxdogg|work> morning all
[15:49:11] <ajpiano> chovy: the aliases of .done to .success, etc, are only going away on the returned jqxhr
[15:49:11] <arielserafini> jarr0dsz: if all you're doing is change the container's html, have you tried using $("#container_game").load() ?
[15:49:12] <ryanneufeld> djsounds02: you'd have to do it
[15:49:17] <jarr0dsz> ah never mind, my bad it doesent work at all ;s
[15:49:27] <ajpiano> the success: fn is never going away
[15:49:29] <chovy> ajpiano: what about $.post().complete()
[15:49:33] <chovy> will that still work?
[15:49:48] <djsounds02> ryanneufeld: Thats not really an option..
[15:50:16] <min|dvir|us> Anyone?
[15:50:25] <arielserafini> djsounds02: if you have to do it with js it's going to be a bit of work, i'm afraid
[15:50:36] <arielserafini> if it even works at all
[15:50:44] <tw2113> you mean js can't do everything?
[15:50:44] <arielserafini> :/
[15:50:58] <tw2113> the cracker jack box lied to me
[15:51:37] <arielserafini> djsounds02: something like checking text length against the width
[15:51:44] <archemike_> i need some help guys, i want to have a button(or a div that looks like a button) that when onclick changes the color(class with a backgorund color) of another div to a different class(different color)
[15:51:52] <archemike_> any suggestions?
[15:51:55] <archemike_> on implementation
[15:51:57] <min|dvir|us> Is there a way to instantiate an element like $('<el>', {prop: val}), defining the element's class= attribute?
[15:52:42] <tw2113> $('.button').click(function() { $('.someotherclass').toggleClass('newclass'); });
[15:54:03] <archemike_> i'm unsure what you mean
[15:54:16] <tw2113> read and think that through
[15:54:23] <arielserafini> min|dvir|us: isn't that the same as $('<el>').addClass() ?
[15:54:28] <raj> jarr0dsz, MXBrandon, how does reloading the other tabs work?
[15:54:30] <min|dvir|us> arielserafini: yes.
[15:54:40] <min|dvir|us> I'd like to avoid the function call, though.
[15:54:44] <archemike_> tw2113:  thanks,  button is an html 5 tag right?  i can add class to that like a div right?
[15:54:50] <arielserafini> min|dvir|us: gotcha
[15:55:02] <djsounds02> arielserafini: check text length against the width but surely if you could check the first line youd be able to apply something to only the first line?
[15:55:02] <tw2113> my example used the class of button
[15:55:22] <min|dvir|us> archemike_: you can add a class to any element.
[15:55:34] <archemike_> tw2113: thanks i'll play with this for a bit should work
[15:55:38] <min|dvir|us> There are attributes that all elements have, like id and class.
[15:55:57] <tw2113> even <html>
[15:56:05] <min|dvir|us> Furthermore, button was around since at least HTML4.
[15:56:11] <min|dvir|us> This is easy stuff to look up on MDN.
[15:56:14] <arielserafini> djsounds02: if you somehow detect text is breaking into two lines, you can replace the html for the h1 element and insert spans to define each line
[15:56:47] <arielserafini> probably not the best way to do it, but it's what's occurring to me right now
[15:57:12] <min|dvir|us> Google "mdn button". First link shows it was defined in 4.01 and 5.
[15:57:27] <tw2113> these days, i pretty much figure everyone doesn't know about these resources like the jquery docs or MDN, and would not be a bad idea to point them there
[15:57:47] <tw2113> assume nothing
[15:58:23] <min|dvir|us> I tell people about MDN and they say "I like w3schools".
[15:58:29] <archemike_> MDV is amazing
[15:58:31] <tw2113> and then you facepalm?
[15:58:31] <archemike_> MDN
[15:58:53] <min|dvir|us> tw2113: I resist the urge to punch them as I direct them to w3fools.
[15:59:08] <tw2113> MDN loves contributors, btw
[15:59:13] <min|dvir|us> And then they still don't listen.
[15:59:26] <min|dvir|us> Gotta make 'em feel stupid or something.
[15:59:31] * tw2113 knows some of the MDN people in person
[15:59:50] <Abbas|> is there a way to make jQuery not break when try to validation form fields named like 'my-first-field' i.e. with dashes
[15:59:53] <min|dvir|us> Yeah, I was at a Mozilla hackathon.
[15:59:59] <min|dvir|us> I met some of the guys.
[16:01:21] <arielserafini> min|dvir|us: so, the only reference to that {} thing you mentioned
[16:01:21] <min|dvir|us> (What's your story, tw2113?)
[16:01:25] <arielserafini> that i found
[16:01:31] <arielserafini> is http://api.jquery.com/jQuery/
[16:01:48] <arielserafini> I had no idea you could do that
[16:02:12] <min|dvir|us> OK, perfect.
[16:02:12] <tw2113> got invited to an in-person MDN hackathon over a long weekend
[16:02:21] <chovy> why did they change .complete() to .always()?
[16:02:22] <tw2113> Mozilla paid everything
[16:02:34] <min|dvir|us> tw2113: that's what's up.
[16:02:43] <min|dvir|us> arielserafini: perfect, just what I was looking for, thanks.
[16:02:48] <arielserafini> I only went to a MDN localization sprint
[16:02:49] <tw2113> flight, hotel, food :D
[16:02:49] <arielserafini> :/
[16:02:50] <min|dvir|us> I forgot you can wrap dict props in ''.
[16:03:12] <arielserafini> ah, right, class
[16:03:40] <arielserafini> min|dvir|us: I wonder about the performance benefits, though
[16:03:49] <arielserafini> if any , that is
[16:03:54] <CSSNoob> I'm trying to recreate the main box function of this website homepage  http://urbanrethink.com/    ---   Do you guys have any recommendations for a complete Jquery noob?
[16:05:08] <archemike_> CSSNoob:  I don't like the pink text wrap on the jquery box lol no offense
[16:07:11] <arielserafini> CSSNoob: http://jqueryui.com/demos/tabs/
[16:07:12] <CSSNoob> None taken, I'm supposed to be our company's designer, although my design input doesn't get heard much
[16:08:40] <arielserafini> pink text wrap?
[16:08:46] <arielserafini> where?
[16:09:16] <CSSNoob> I think he means the white text on red gradient that slides out
[16:17:04] <djsounds02> arielserafini: still here?
[16:22:38] <archemike_> heres my pastebin for changing classes of a button to change color help greatly appreciated for what i'm doing wrong
[16:22:39] <archemike_> http://pastebin.com/ZGN27iwZ
[16:23:37] <arielserafini> djsounds02: i'm here
[16:27:50] <Xgc> archemike_: Where's the element with class='pagecolor1' ?
[16:28:34] <archemike_> further down  <div id="main-container" style="min-height: 237px;"> 		<div id="my_portfolio" class="page corners pagecolor1"> 	<!--<div id="portfoliograbdiv"> 	Move me for convenience :) 	</div> -->     <div id="tabs">     <ul> 		<li><a href="#tab-1" class="btn-blue">Education</a></li> 		<li><a href="#tab-2" class="btn-blue">Employment</a></li> 		<li><a href="#tab-3" class="btn-blue">Skillsets</a></li> 		<li><a href="#tab-4" class="
[16:29:37] <Xgc> archemike_: Are you sure you have the right class name?
[16:31:39] <archemike_> i'm testing
[16:31:52] <archemike_> xgc: i'm sure they're named right it's something else
[16:32:58] <arielserafini> djsounds02: are YOU there?
[16:33:07] <Xgc> archemike_: Check that the selector is finding a match.
[16:36:57] <tw2113> archemike_, return true
[16:37:57] <arielserafini> djsounds02: :(
[16:39:19] <listerine> does anyone already had problems mixing animations with synchronous ajax requests? it seems that animations functions such as hide (without delay) is being executed asynchronously and once the synchronous ajax request happens subsequently it is executed before the animation
[16:41:09] <3JTAADPFM> >synchronous ajax request
[16:41:15] <3JTAADPFM> that's a bit of a contradiction listerine
[16:41:44] <termite> listerine: can you you create a fiddle
[16:41:54] <raj> can $.cookie() not accept an object?
[16:42:58] <MistuhKurtz> listerine, you probably just need to use callbacks properly. if you can create a fiddle as termite asked it would help us debug it for you.
[16:42:59] <arielserafini> what do the docs say?
[16:45:51] <termite> . As of jQuery 1.8, the use of async: false with jqXHR ($.Deferred) is deprecated; you must use the complete/success/error callbacks.
[16:49:25] <listerine> MistuhKurtz, I'm developing a library that will paginate in a very specific manner for a lot of pages .. so I'm developing a class that has the pagination algorithms and interacts with a parameterized repository (that talks with my backend)
[16:50:04] <listerine> if I pass a function of my class to the repository I have a problem with the context (the classical 'this' problem)
[16:50:05] <MistuhKurtz> ah
[16:50:11] <listerine> so
[16:51:04] <listerine> I decided to have synchronous calls to keep the logic inside my own library and just call methods of the repository to obtain data synchronously Ö without passing callbacks
[16:51:24] <MistuhKurtz> listerine, set another var = this; and use that var in the function that introduces a new scope
[16:51:26] <listerine> I already fixed it by creating a closure that captures the context of my class
[16:51:29] <danzik17> listerine: sync ajax calls aren't very user friendly.
[16:52:03] <MistuhKurtz> hm
[16:52:11] <MistuhKurtz> hard to think what could be wrong without a look at the code
[16:52:37] <termite> listerine: just use a closure that way you can keep scope
[16:52:42] <listerine> MistuhKurtz, yeah yeah .. I kind did that .. but I didn't liked the resulting code .. so I was wondering why the problem with synchronous ajax requests and animation functions
[16:53:01] <listerine> listerine> I already fixed it by creating a closure that captures the context of my class
[16:53:05] <listerine> termite,
[16:53:12] <listerine> :)
[16:53:20] <MistuhKurtz> Sorry I don't understand what a 'synchronous' asynchronous javascript and xml request is :P
[16:54:21] <listerine> MistuhKurtz, http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/ look the "async" section
[16:55:10] <MistuhKurtz> interesting
[16:55:16] <MistuhKurtz> didn't realize that was possible
[16:55:55] <MistuhKurtz> but I'm inclined to think you should maybe try doing it async...however I really have no idea what's going on in your code
[16:58:16] <min|dvir|us> Who's doing synchronous AJAX?
[16:58:34] <min|dvir|us> That's next to impossible unless you're doing it intentionally.
[16:59:43] <termite> min|dvir|us: hahha no need to rehash the debate
[17:00:01] <termite> he no longer is doing it
[17:25:31] <And_> hide() function works even hiding the css class of an element?
[17:36:22] <beasty> morning guys
[17:38:01] <And_> hide() function works even hiding the css class of an element?
[17:38:33] <arielserafini> And_: what do you mean?
[17:38:49] <MistuhKurtz> And_, hide() sets an inline style to display:none;
[17:38:57] <MistuhKurtz> over-riding any other CSS rules targeting that element.
[17:39:16] <And_> so u mean i should try $('#response').css("display", "none");
[17:41:37] <MistuhKurtz> And_, is hide() not working for you?
[17:41:48] <MistuhKurtz> $("#response").hide(); should work just fine.
[17:41:58] <And_> MistuhKurtz:  didnt work
[17:42:49] <MistuhKurtz> And_, set up a jsfiddle and I'll try
[17:42:55] <MistuhKurtz> fixing it for you
[17:42:56] <And_> ok
[17:44:51] <And_> MistuhKurtz:  actually im just trying something simple like this http://pastie.org/4794464
[17:45:15] <And_> whenever i load a form via href i want the div to hide
[17:45:37] <MistuhKurtz> and_ isolate it on jsfiddle and I'll be happy to fix it for you
[18:13:11] <haizum> ok this is driving me nuts... firefox is giving me this error: JSON.parse: bad control character in string literal
[18:13:11] <haizum> Line 17 it has to do with the facebook like button code, and it's only happening every 2nd page refresh. doesn't  happen in chrome.
[18:25:38] <haizum> is there really nobody around?
[18:25:38] <haizum> hmm
[18:26:40] <danheberden> haizum: sounds like you have a control character in your json
[18:26:56] <danheberden> is this json being returned directly by facebook?
[18:28:08] <b1lly> haizum: sup
[18:31:06] <haizum> danheberden: that code is straight from facebook
[18:31:48] <danheberden> bummer
[18:32:17] <danheberden> you could google the regex to match control character ranges
[18:32:29] <danheberden> and clean them out of the json before parsing it
[18:35:10] <haizum> danheberden: huh?
[18:35:22] <haizum> danheberden: i'm just trying to add a damn like button on my page. it shouldn't be this complicated.
[18:35:41] <danheberden> haizum: you're right, you should ask facebook why they have invalid json coming to you from their api
[18:36:35] <haizum> exactly
[18:36:49] <haizum> but why then does it work in chrome
[18:36:54] <haizum> and why does it only happen every 2nd page load
[18:36:56] <haizum> makes no sense
[18:37:51] <danheberden> perhaps the data you're sending to them to start with has bad characters in it?
[18:37:58] <danheberden> and they are responding with the same bad characters?
[18:38:05] <danheberden> and firefox might be more picky than chrome
[18:38:21] <danheberden> they have known to be slightly different on some things some times
[18:39:22] <goddard> how can i transfer multiple post input forms values in an ajax post?
[18:40:29] <blindMoe> combine the values and then serialize them?
[18:40:38] <blindMoe> I have never had to do that but that is where I would think to start
[18:42:09] <danheberden> goddard, either get them manually and put them into the data object or use serialize or see ?serializeObject
[18:42:10] <bot-t> goddard, Whereas jQuery‚Äôs built-in .serializeArray() method serializes a form into an array, .serializeObject() serializes a form into an (arguably more useful) object. http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-misc-plugins/#serializeobject
[18:42:20] <danheberden> or https://github.com/danheberden/serializeObject
[18:42:47] <danheberden> then $.ajax({ url: 'yourUrl', data: thatObjectOfYourFormValues, type: 'POST' })
[19:06:54] <coldhead> your own's the sweetest thing inside of you
[19:17:38] <goddard> thanks

[20:55:39] <harbhub> i'm having a weird issue
[20:55:52] <harbhub> $('input').focus

[20:56:10] <harbhub> and that generated input
[20:56:15] <harbhub> doesnt listen!
[20:56:19] <harbhub> why could that be?
[20:56:28] <harbhub> the new input listens to my static css
[20:56:37] <harbhub> but wont listen to the focus event.. in the doc ready

[21:45:13] <amccloud> How do I get an elements offset relative to it's container and not the document?
[21:45:21] <amccloud> For example this should be 0 http://jsfiddle.net/DfRLv/
[21:46:36] <Cork> ?.position @ amccloud
[21:46:37] <bot-t> amccloud, .position(): Get the current coordinates of the first element in the set of matched elements, relative to the offset parent. http://api.jquery.com/position/
[21:46:52] <amccloud> oh lets try!
[21:46:58] <Cork> offset is always to the window
[21:47:04] <Cork> ?.offset
[21:47:04] <bot-t> .offset(): Get the current coordinates of the first element in the set of matched elements, relative to the document. http://api.jquery.com/offset/
[21:47:18] <Cork> or ya rather the document
[21:48:34] <amccloud> Cork: I just tried position and i'm also getting 50. http://jsfiddle.net/DfRLv/1/
[21:51:06] <Cork> amccloud: http://jsfiddle.net/DfRLv/2/
[21:51:30] <Cork> amccloud: you have to make the container an offset parent
[21:51:43] <Cork> (position other then static)
[21:53:17] <amccloud> sweet thanks!
[22:01:52] <snowfox_ben> Trying to sort out this. I want to rotate an image, which I am currently rotating with css3. This is currently hover activated. The issue is, I have text placed above the rotating image, and it is super easy to lose hover focus. I think I can improve this experience with some jQuery.
[22:02:23] <snowfox_ben> Should I on hover of text, somehow force the image (that has now lost focus) rotate?
[22:06:18] <bahodir> monstordh, sorry i didn't see your messages. I figured it out. thanks
[22:13:34] <Cork> snowfox_ben: use mouseenter / mouseleave
[22:13:46] <Cork> that way all child elements will not trigger the event
[22:14:03] <Cork> its a jquery faked event though, so you can't use it in your css
[22:14:35] <snowfox_ben> Cork, that is fine. I need it to work cross-browser, so using css3 only is not going to cut it
[22:14:58] <snowfox_ben> thanks for the suggestion, I will see what I can cook up
[22:18:57] <DoctorMonocular> I have a jquery issue in my rails project. I created a dom element dynamically that meets the selection criteria for an event I defined. I used .on('change, ‚Ä¶) so that the event would fire for any new elements, but the events don't fire as expected. What's the right way to make an event "live"?
[22:25:37] <agaba> Hello all
[22:26:06] <agaba> Is there a way to wait for the contents of iframe to load and then fetch a portion of the content into a variable?
[22:27:39] <Ravindran> DoctorMonocular: use event delegation here
[22:28:14] <Ravindran> DoctorMonocular: You can attach event to the parent container and filter by the child selectors so the event will be handled for future elements as well
[22:28:35] <DoctorMonocular> working on that right now, I'll report back 8)
[22:28:55] <hariom> I am using latest jquery and jquery-ui. My page works great in IE9, FF and Chrome but it doesn't work on IE8. HOw to figure out which part if creating problem?
[22:29:17] <Ravindran> DoctorMonocular: http://api.jquery.com/delegate/ you can check this doc on how to use .on to achieve delegate functionality
[22:29:22] <hariom> I am using .on(), dialog, autocomplete and cookies
[22:29:28] <DoctorMonocular> got it, it's working now. yay!
[22:29:29] <DoctorMonocular> thanks a lot
[22:29:54] <DoctorMonocular> hariom, what does the debugger say?
[22:30:59] <hariom> DoctorMonocular: It doesn't support indexOf
[22:31:12] <DoctorMonocular> what doesn't?
[22:31:21] <Cork> snowfox_ben: you can't rotate images without css3
[22:31:31] <hariom> DoctorMonocular: Object doesn't support property or method 'indexOf'
[22:31:41] <Cork> snowfox_ben: you would have to have rotated versions of the image and download them from the server
[22:31:55] <snowfox_ben> Cork, sorry, that is not what I meant
[22:32:04] <Cork> ok?
[22:32:49] <snowfox_ben> Of course I would be using CSS3. But on top of that I will be using MS Filters, etc
[22:33:22] <Cork> msfilter can only do 90deg rotations though, but that might be good enough for you
[22:33:35] <Ravindran> agaba: You can listen on 'load'event on iframe. However, the iframe shd be in same domain, if you need to extract content from it
[22:34:10] <agaba> Ravindran: I have used the load event, but it still returns null
[22:34:15] <Cork> snowfox_ben: but you just need to have a feature detection and use filter or transition depending on whats supported
[22:34:36] <snowfox_ben> Right. i will :)
[22:34:54] <Ravindran> hariom: you can use IE developer tools and see which object you are receiving this error
[22:35:18] <hariom> Ravindrn: Already did. Object doesn't support property or method 'indexOf'
[22:35:27] <Cork> snowfox_ben: just want to correct the can't rorate without css3, you can use canvas, but its limitation is about the same as css3 so....
[22:35:45] <Cork> (in what versions it works in)
[22:36:01] <Ravindran> agaba: is the load event triggered properly? Does the iframe also loading page from same domain
[22:37:02] <Ravindran> hariom: There might be some option to 'break on exception' or something like that. You can use that to see which object doesn't support this method
[22:37:58] <hariom> Ravindra: I guess I found the ans on StackOverflow. Somebody else also had problem with indexOf and jquery provides inArray function for replacement.
[22:40:38] <Ravindran> hariom: great.
[22:42:11] <agaba> Lets approach this a different way. How do I get the contents of iframe if I get the iframe like so: var iframe = $('#banner-iframe');
[22:42:59] <Cork> agaba: is the iframe content from the same domain?
[22:43:09] <agaba> Cork: yes
[22:44:03] <Cork> $().contents()
[22:47:44] <kostodo> : Is there any js library which I can use to standardise CSS3 support across different browsers?
[22:50:55] <Cork> kostodo: simplest solution is to use a preprocessor
[22:51:13] <kostodo> Cork: not sure I'm following
[22:51:13] <Cork> kostodo: its a bad idea to have css depend on js
[22:51:20] <MrTrick> Is there some reason that IE(9) is dropping a bunch of the response headers out of the xhr?
[22:51:29] <Ravindran> agaba: you need to get the iframe's contentWindow/contentDocument correctly. Hope this thread wil help. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2947082/whats-the-most-concise-cross-browser-way-to-access-an-iframe-elements-window
[22:51:40] <Cork> kostodo: a pre processor that generates all the different types of prefix and so on
[22:51:41] <amccloud> Anyway I can better optimize this? http://jsfiddle.net/6CRJZ/
[22:51:54] <Cork> kostodo: so what the server sends to the client is just a plain css file
[22:51:59] <Ravindran> agaba: once you get the iframe doc, you can use it as context in jquery selector to get element inside iframe
[22:52:06] <kostodo> Cork: gotch
[22:52:16] <MrTrick> In Firefox and Chrome I see 6 headers: Date, X-Powered-By, Connection, Content-Length, Server, Content-Type
[22:52:18] <amccloud> As the number of rows goes up things get a bit out of control...
[22:52:19] <agaba> Ravindran: thanks, will try that
[22:52:38] <MrTrick> In IE9, I only get 3: X-Powered-By, Content-Length, Content-Type.
[22:59:59] <amccloud> here is a slow test case. http://jsfiddle.net/6CRJZ/1/
[23:00:50] <amccloud> I know the $rows.each is killing my performance I just can't think of a way to handle that with variable row height...
[23:06:36] * MrTrick stabs IE unnoticed caching behaviour
[23:09:38] <coldhead> no no, ios6 does it too now
[23:09:42] <coldhead> it's "cool"
[23:09:48] <coldhead> cache or be cached
[23:10:45] <GoSox> i'm trying to apply a class to a table row by using $(this).parent().parent().addClass("class"); but it's not working
[23:11:07] <GoSox> the layout is a somple <tr><td><a> where the a is what's being clicked on
[23:11:31] <Cork> GoSox: $(this).closest('tr').addClass('class')
[23:12:01] <GoSox> nope
[23:12:03] <GoSox> doesn't work
[23:12:09] <GoSox> everything else this function does, work
[23:12:12] <Cork> then this isn't a child of the tr
[23:12:14] <GoSox> and there are no errors
[23:12:32] <Cork> check your html so its valid
[23:12:43] <Cork> ?g w3c validate
[23:12:44] <bot-t> Cork, The W3C Markup Validation Service - http://validator.w3.org/
[23:15:39] <GoSox> it can't check my document, probably because it's too big
[23:15:56] <GoSox> but regardless, it's very simple html and it looks valid to me eye
[23:15:58] <Cork> GoSox: you can if you point it to an url
[23:17:10] <Cork> GoSox: anyway theres two options either the this variable isn't referring to the a tag, or your html is invalid
[23:18:43] <GoSox> well i'm pretty confident the my code is valid, so let me share more of my actual code
[23:20:06] <GoSox> wow pastebin is slowwwww tonight
[23:20:30] <GoSox> wow still waiting
[23:20:46] <GoSox> that was insane. anyway, line 12 is where nothing happens
[23:20:47] <Cork> its prob cause your pasting a lost of data
[23:20:47] <GoSox> http://pastebin.com/5gZZpzk8
[23:20:51] <GoSox> i'm not
[23:21:07] <Cork> uh
[23:21:08] <GoSox> is my $(this) not the $(this) i think it is maybe?
[23:21:14] <Cork> ya this will point to window there
[23:21:26] <GoSox> huh?
[23:21:28] <Cork> you need to store this before you cann .get
[23:21:37] <Cork> var $self = $(this);
[23:21:43] <GoSox> ah
[23:21:45] <GoSox> ok ill try that
[23:21:49] <Cork> $.get( ..., function() { $self }
[23:22:20] <Cork> cann==call
[23:22:51] <GoSox> yup that did it
[23:22:52] <GoSox> thanks!
[23:25:57] <GoSox> does an attribute have to already exist before i can set it with .attr( )?
[23:26:37] <arielserafini> GoSox: no
[23:30:38] <GoSox> great
[23:31:05] <GoSox> i just spent about 4 hours making a jquery/php system to geocode about 840 addresses and enter them into my site's database
[23:31:28] <GoSox> i'm hoping spending 4 hours making this system was the quick way
[23:31:30] <GoSox> :D
[23:48:25] <GoSox>  that would be cool for lists of local restaurants, showing realtime arrows pointing towards the restaurant :)
[23:48:32] <GoSox> pretty fancy for a webapp
[23:49:15] <noregret> I have a list of those A/B dates http://pastie.org/4795959 i want to put them in a structure, where i should compare all B's and find out the more current date then get its associate A date, how can i do that in js ?
[23:49:27] <agaba> What does this line do? $('#banner-iframe-1').load( function() { ‚Ä¶ }
[23:50:44] <Cork> agaba: binds an event listner
[23:50:48] <Cork> listener even
[23:51:02] <agaba> Cork: Does it wait for the element to load completely?
[23:51:14] <Cork> ?.load
[23:51:14] <bot-t> .load(handler): Bind an event handler to the "load" JavaScript event. http://api.jquery.com/load-event/
[23:53:41] <agaba> this is really frustrating‚Ä¶ I cannot get the contents of an iframe to be copied to another place at the time needed by running js script, because the src of the iframe is not loaded yet
[23:55:48] <karn> does anyone know the color theme used in the top screenshot? http://blogs.adobe.com/typblography/2012/09/source-code-pro.html
[23:58:58] <arielserafini> karn: looks like solarized
[23:59:06] <arielserafini> not sure though
