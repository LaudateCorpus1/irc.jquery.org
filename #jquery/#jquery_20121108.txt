[00:01:17] <chovy> how do i get a copy of $('<div />');
[00:01:33] <chovy> i need to insert it with .replaceWith in multiple places
[00:03:20] <gnarf> ?replaceWith
[00:03:21] <bot-t> .replaceWith(newContent): Replace each element in the set of matched elements with the provided new content. http://api.jquery.com/replaceWith/
[00:03:48] <gnarf> chovy: if you pass a string, it will clone
[00:04:16] <gnarf> chovy: if you pass a jQuery() there is only one ,so the first is replaced, but others aren't
[00:04:34] <gnarf> chovy: you can do both if you .replaceWith(function() { return $htm.clone(); })
[00:04:56] <gnarf> chovy: of all the uses tho, plain string is your best bet there IMO
[00:05:43] <chovy> i need to hide it first, that is the only reason i'm convert the string, so I can do $htm.hide()
[00:05:56] <chovy> then it gets replaceWith and fades in
[00:05:59] <gnarf> chovy: style='display: none'
[00:06:12] <chovy> i can't do that. i don't have control over the markup
[00:06:22] <gnarf> fair
[00:06:28] <chovy> it is given to me by api
[00:06:29] <gnarf> use the function then
[00:07:12] <gnarf> chovy: actually
[00:07:30] <gnarf> chovy: can you get a demo fiddle?
[00:07:41] <gnarf> er nvm
[00:07:46] <gnarf> found the link
[00:07:47] <chovy> didn't i paste one?
[00:07:53] <chovy> how come this doesn't replace both .foo elements? http://jsfiddle.net/chovy/mWJfj/
[00:08:56] <chovy> still doesn' twork with method
[00:11:43] <chovy> actually, that works. but it won't fade in
[00:11:56] <chovy> $followers.replaceWith(function(){
[00:11:56] <chovy>               return $htm.clone();
[00:11:56] <chovy>             }).fadeIn();
[00:12:18] <chovy> i guess i have to fade in $followers.fadeIn() after the replace with, not chaining it
[00:12:42] <gnarf> chovy: http://jsfiddle.net/chovy/mWJfj/
[00:13:28] <ravenzz> is there a way to avoid the datapicker to be shown on focus?

[00:13:50] <chovy> gnarf: did you change something?
[00:13:53] <ravenzz> I don't want the button neither
[00:13:59] <gnarf> chovy: fiddle being slow
[00:14:02] <gnarf> didn't copy the save
[00:14:56] <chovy> i think $followers is redefined so I can no longer chain after .replaceWith, I tried $followers.fadeIn() and that didn't work either.
[00:15:10] <chovy> its in the dom, its just hidden
[00:15:13] <gnarf> so it still references the old dom
[00:15:25] <gnarf> there isn't a $followers in my example either
[00:15:30] <gnarf> chovy: http://jsfiddle.net/gnarf/mWJfj/2/
[00:15:39] <gnarf> .map might make more sense
[00:15:41] <chovy> $foos == $folowers
[00:15:53] <gnarf> k
[00:16:13] <gnarf> chovy: how about this
[00:16:51] <chovy> #2?
[00:17:52] <gnarf> #2 seems okay
[00:18:20] <chovy> fildder is slow
[00:18:47] <gnarf> agree
[00:19:29] <gnarf> chovy: i mean, none of the syntaxes are very clean for that
[00:19:42] <chovy> i think i have a shorter way, just wondering if it works
[00:20:07] <gnarf> actually

[03:08:54] <Hermiene> I'm using click() for handling the user clicking on a bunch of items, like this: $('.clickClass').click(function() { ... }); Now, each element also has an id, so that different things can happen depending on which item the user clicks.
[03:09:10] <Hermiene> How do I fetch back exactly which element the user clicks?
[03:10:12] <Hermiene> I went $('.clickClass').click(function(e) { console.log(e); }); and checked out the object in Firebug, and figured out that I COULD simply wander into the e object and fetch it, but maybe there's a better way?
[03:11:17] <Hermiene> (I toyed around with $('#clickId').click(function() { ... }); for each of the ids, but I'm running into problems that way, and figured I'd better rewrite the code, and I think this way is better.)

I have a library i use which attaches a change event via elem.on('change', 'input, select', changeFn); and then i my own code, i attach change event to elem with elem.change(fn); and now changeFn is not called as if me adding a second event handler removes the first one. How come that be? As far as i know, jquery allows for multiple handler on one event via qeueing and it has always worked before. Any ideas?

[04:46:30] <Qdest> So I've made this little thingy http://jsfiddle.net/9kH3X/ <-- so far I've managed it to merely work. The issue I'm having is that it's not "spammable", if you hover the 3 boxes quickly, e.g. from left to right, some of them get "stuck". I've tried fiddeling with .stop(true) etc, but I need some assistance sorting it. I believe it comes down to how I animate etc. Any tips?
[04:47:11] <AdamPDotty> my colleague had that and took a deeper look into the fired events. I do not know, what he took then, is there a fetch-event?
[04:47:33] <dblosevn> think theres a load event
[04:48:49] <dawkirst> AdamPDotty if windows don't load, what does? what can I listen for?
[04:49:04] <AdamPDotty> I am not sure about the event
[04:49:11] <AdamPDotty> a page gets loaded
[04:49:32] <AdamPDotty> so pageLoad, pageShow, pageFetch something like that
[04:50:30] <AdamPDotty> pageinit
[04:50:37] <dblosevn> AdamPDotty: dawkirst: pagebeforeload, pageload, pageloadfailed, pagebeforechange, pagechangefailed theres plenty of event to bind too
[04:50:51] <dawkirst> thanks dblosevn
[04:51:26] <dblosevn> pageinit is the cloest to domready youll get though
[04:51:37] <dblosevn> *closest
[05:00:08] <dawkirst> AdamPDotty could you point me to an example where pageLoad is used?
[05:12:55] <hamurgerl> dawkirst: read the first yellow box: http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/api/events.html
[05:14:40] <dawkirst2> hamurgerl it works, now I just need to understand it conceptually
[05:15:32] <dawkirst2> hamurgerl as I don't fully understand what that code does
[05:15:48] <rgr> how could I select all elements that have a "name" atribute?
[05:16:37] <NodeX> http://api.jquery.com/attribute-equals-selector/
[05:16:56] <NodeX> http://api.jquery.com/attribute-contains-selector/
[05:17:54] <Qdest> rgr $('[name]') perhaps?
[05:24:43] <slikts> what's going on with the plugins.jquery.com site, when will it start working?
[05:27:50] <Hermiene> I'm having problems with a .click() function, and I have no idea why it doesn't work
[05:28:00] <NodeX> !fiddle
[05:28:14] <NodeX> pastebin/fiddle your code
[05:28:51] <Hermiene> I have a function which runs when the user clicks something, and it paints up (using .append()) a bunch of stuff, including a <div> with a class="foo"
[05:29:23] <Hermiene> Now, another thingy outside that, $('.foo').click() { ... }, is the thing that doesn't work.
[05:29:36] <Hermiene> NodeX: Too much code
[05:30:09] <Hermiene> I mean, it simply should work, unless it's got something to do with the fact that the <div> element is getting added via .append()
[05:33:57] <faraway> Hermiene: my guess .. you do $(".foo").click()   before the div with the class "foo" is added to dom
[05:34:17] <Lost123> dblosevn: you there?
[05:34:22] <Hermiene> faraway: I thought about that, and moved the $('.foo').click() { ... } below the code which adds the <div> to the DOM, but still no luck
[05:35:09] <Hermiene> So to explain a little more, I have a checkbox which, when clicked, calls a function, paintEditBox(), and it's inside that function that the <div> gets made
[05:36:30] <faraway> Hermiene: well without knowing your code, your explanations don't help much ... what does a console.log($('.foo').length); prints to console ?
[05:38:58] <Lost123> i want to set a value in a field when autocomplete returns nothing, this works perfectly in http://jsbin.com/onahir/5/edit but here http://preview.tinyurl.com/bmnwm5q if you type subway and go to next page and check text field it doesnt.
[05:39:10] <Hermiene> faraway: 1 if paster after the .append(), 0 if before
[05:39:12] <Hermiene> As expected
[05:39:13] <code_ph0y_> hey guys!
[05:39:24] <Hermiene> It increments for each checkbox checked, as expected
[05:39:30] <code_ph0y_> how do you trigger an accordion tab?
[05:40:55] <kborchers> Hermiene: without seeing your code it's hard to tell but you probably need to look into event delegation. also, see ?on
[05:40:55] <bot-t> Hermiene, .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements, including delegation and live binding. http://api.jquery.com/on/

[05:43:47] <dblosevn> Lost123: sup
[05:44:31] <Lost123> dblosevn: http://preview.tinyurl.com/bmnwm5q check here please, the text field doesn't get populated, type in subway and go to next page. On next page check the box on top
[05:46:39] <AL13N_work> i execute a do while loop and the first line in the loop gets executed and the 2nd one doesn't (according to firebug): http://pastebin.com/as4Qw67e
[05:46:54] <AL13N_work> can anyone help me and take a look? it seems simple enough
[05:46:58] <dblosevn> Lost123: where is the text field it supossed to write too?
[05:48:07] <Lost123> are you on second page now, the one with map?
[05:48:36] <dblosevn> ya
[05:49:13] <Lost123> the field on top orange bar which says search another franchise or subway if u typed in subway on the page earlier
[05:50:22] <seutje> AL13N_work: what's this suppose to do, cause I'm pretty sure there's a better way of doing this
[05:50:35] <dblosevn> Lost123:  $( "#return_value" ).show(); after $( "#return_value" ).val( "1");
[05:51:03] <Siver> Is there a way to limit ajax requests (which are done inside a plugin) until the previous was completed? No matter what I try (disable async requests, time-outs), I keep having issues with it in firefox. In chrome, it waits nicely until my previous request has completed running, but it doesn't in firefox

[06:00:03] <piecyk> hi, quick question was is the best approach for javascript(jquery) with a tag href in html?
[06:01:29] <Aero`> Hi guys :) !
[06:01:41] <Aero`> Got a little javascript problem on a condition
[06:01:48] <Aero`> anyone could help :) ?
[06:02:26] <Cheffheid> shoot
[06:02:51] <Aero`> I'm developping a contact form, and as a catchpa I want the user to make "4+3=" for instance
[06:02:59] <Aero`> and then my form is sent via $.ajax
[06:03:05] <sylock> hello guys. I have a problem related to the async property of the javascript and I can't figure out a way to solve it : I have a function called when a form is submitted. This function call some each functions related to current dom and for each make a getJSON. Then I want to push all these JSON results into one array and pass the entire array to another function. here is the pastebin : http://pastebin.com/CBQGRxiK
[06:03:07] <Aero`> so I made a condition :
[06:03:25] <Aero`> var verif = $("#verif").val();
[06:03:25] <Aero`> 		if(verif == 7){  send ajax } else {error}
[06:03:47] <Aero`> but it just doesn't work, it gets on the "else" side every time
[06:03:50] <jugstah_> quick question... how does one do a OR on the selectors?
[06:04:01] <Aero`> ||
[06:04:10] <sylock> my problem is that the call the that another function (line 56 - 57 on the pastebin) is done before all the getjson are done.
[06:04:30] <jugstah_> Aero, like this? if ($('#SpotlightSlides .Slides > div:nth-child(4)') ||
[06:04:31] <jugstah_> ??
[06:05:54] <Aero`> I think I've seen that somewhere but to be honest I don't have any idea.. || is generic for OR in javascript, I assume it would work but I don't have a damn idea
[06:06:10] <jugstah_> well, I'll go give it a shot then :-)
[06:06:11] <jugstah_> brb
[06:06:35] <AL13N_work> can anyone help met with this do while loop? http://pastebin.com/bAC3ygA1
[06:07:18] <AL13N_work> the first line inside the do {} while gets executed, but the 2nd line isn't, according to firebug and firebug doesn't show any errors
[06:11:47] <seutje> AL13N_work: like this? http://jsbin.com/omewuz/1
[06:12:11] <seutje> when clicking on "me", the 2 around it should turn red, skipping any "not me"s
[06:18:15] <AL13N_work> seutje: just now, i was thinking, that i might use the :has() selector
[06:18:32] <AL13N_work> seutje: but yes something like thsi
[06:18:59] <seutje> mind tose sizzle specific selectors\
[06:19:02] <seutje> those*
[06:19:12] <AL13N_work> wdym?
[06:19:42] <seutje> they can be a bit brutal on the performance

[06:19:54] <Somatt_wrk> jquery 1.8.2 seems to be returning a wrongful value for outerWidth() in IE8 when using box-sizing:border-box. Any clue about that ?
[06:20:39] <seutje> AL13N_work: added some comments to my example
[06:21:56] <AL13N_work> seutje: so, closest() is like a more performant .parents(:first) ?
[06:22:26] <seutje> AL13N_work: should be, but you could jsperf it
[06:22:33] <greek> Hi fellas. We're calling a PHP script via a $.ajax call, which is in turn taking a while to execute before it returns a response. What are our options - by way of jQuery - for informing the user to "please wait" - perhaps with a spinning wheel or modal greyed out screen or something? Thanks
[06:24:10] <Somatt_wrk> nevermind my previous question, a real ie8 doesn't have this issue, only compatibility mode in ie9
[06:24:45] <pachet> greek: see jquery ui dialog coupled with progressbar
[06:24:46] <AL13N_work> seutje: and !$(bla).length == ($(bla).size() == 0) ? but hopefully more performant too?
[06:25:07] <seutje> wtf does that even mean?
[06:25:31] <seutje> not a big fan of doing loose checks with type coercion
[06:25:34] <pachet> $some_collection.length === 0
[06:25:37] <pachet> ^ your best bet
[06:26:08] <AL13N_work> well, i've been using the .size() jquery function since ages, didn't know there was a .length propery that could be used
[06:26:14] <seutje> why not ($foo.length === 0) === TRUE?
[06:26:30] <seutje> or lets add more redundancy :D
[06:26:57] <seutje> why not ((!($foo.length === 0) === TRUE) === FALSE)?
[06:27:01] <pachet> if ( 1 === + ( $foo.length === 0 ) )
[06:27:02] <seutje> confused yet?
[06:27:06] <AL13N_work> seutje: i just meant that .length property returns the same as the .size() function?
[06:27:11] <seutje> yeah
[06:27:46] <seutje> $.fn.size = function () { return this.length; } is pretty much what size() is
[06:27:58] <seutje> never understood why that's in there
[06:28:04] <Hermiene> Is there something horribly wrong with this? http://pastebin.com/3zcnTagF
[06:28:34] <Hermiene> Ah, disregarding the single quotation not being escaped. >.<
[06:29:00] <jugstah_> aero, thanks for the || feedback, that worked.
[06:29:49] <seutje> ?on @ Hermiene
[06:29:50] <bot-t> Hermiene, .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements, including delegation and live binding. http://api.jquery.com/on/

[06:30:03] <jugstah_> be back later
[06:30:24] <seutje> Hermiene: change body to the lowest level element that doesn't change for better perf
[06:31:00] <khaan> hi guys. Sorry for being a total n00b. Question: how can i make something like "when hovering on link change all other divs which are NOT in a class?". To explain: you have two buttons and three divs. I want that on hover the opacity of the ones NOT highlighted fades to .5. Any hint / help is welcome. thanks in advance :)
[06:31:40] <Hermiene> seutje: I'll look into the on() way of doing things, but what's wrong with my code? Shouldn't that work...?
[06:31:57] <seutje> Hermiene: nope, there's no #bar at the moment that code is evaluated
[06:32:16] <seutje> so that click is being run on an empty collection
[06:32:26] <Hermiene> seutje: But isn't the code run when the user clicks the element?
[06:32:36] <seutje> nope
[06:32:46] <Hermiene> So why would the on() thingy work?
[06:33:07] <seutje> coz it binds it to the body and on click checks if the clicked element matches the #bar selector
[06:33:09] <juha_> khaan: something like $("div").hover(function() { $("div").not($(this)).css("opacity":0.5); });
[06:33:29] <seutje> juha_: u can drop the $() around this
[06:34:04] <juha_> seutje: good point
[06:34:13] <Hermiene> seutje: Ok, so would you say it's worth it to rewrite my code to use the on() way of doing event handling?
[06:34:39] <seutje> Hermiene: yesh, as the docs say, it is the preferred way of handling pretty much all events
[06:34:48] <Hermiene> Right-o
[06:35:11] <pachet> and might as well get in the habit of namespacing specific events!
[06:35:17] <grafi> internally its .on anyways ;)
[06:35:22] <pachet> $('.foo').on('click.something', function(){})_
[06:35:40] <pachet> s/})_/})
[06:36:21] <seutje> pachet: good point, I still don't always do it :x
[06:39:16] <Hermiene> seutje: So using your example, shouldn't I also be using $('body').on('click', '#foo', function() { ... }); ?
[06:41:30] <seutje> Hermiene: sure
[06:41:31] <Hermiene> Also, how does one decide when to (or whether to) omit the [selector] parameter?
[06:41:53] <seutje> if there's no real scope you can determine
[06:41:56] <Hermiene> Is it always a useful thing to go $('body') ?
[06:41:57] <khaan> _juha: awesome, thank you :)
[06:42:01] <pachet> it depends on whether elements matching that selector will be added to the dom after the event is actually bound
[06:42:19] <pachet> in the case you posted, delegation using body is less performant as long as the element with that id persists in the dom
[06:42:20] <Hermiene> Right
[06:42:26] <seutje> like if u would want to bind to the body, it'd be silly to do $('body').on('click', 'body', ...
[06:42:55] <seutje> yeah, that's why I said u should bring it down to the lowest common element u know won't change
[06:43:25] <Hermiene> pachet: Ok, so since the id is changed based on user input (which obviously doesn't happen at the document creation time), one HAS to go $('body').on('click', '#bar' ...), or...?
[06:43:54] <pachet> $('#' + some_specified_id).on('click.somenamespace', function(){ --> });
[06:44:19] <pachet> unless i'm misunderstanding you
[06:44:31] <pachet> which is always possible this early in the morning
[06:44:38] <Hermiene> Heh
[06:45:11] <Hermiene> Well, my problem started because I have a bunch of checkboxes. When the user clicks one, he gets an edit box thingy with an option to edit a polygon
[06:45:36] <seutje> Hermiene: another difference is that when using on() on the body with a selector, the handler won't fire if that selector doesn't match when it's clicked, whereas using $('#bar').click will always fire on the element that had that idea when it was bound, if u then change it to foo, it'll still fire
[06:45:41] <Hermiene> Clicking that (generated) button changes the class of the <button>, and the value attribute to say "Finish editing"
[06:46:01] <juha_> khaan: did it work?
[06:46:34] <Hermiene> And then I have another .click() which was supposed to pick up on the changed value of the <button>'s class, which didn't work
[06:46:54] <khaan> still working
[06:56:50] <AL13N_work> seutje: it seems that .prev("hd:has(span.form-edit)") doesn't really work as i would think it does
[06:57:27] <AL13N_work> seutje: i changed that example to test it, but if you click next to a notme, then it clearly fails
[06:59:27] <AL13N_work> seutje: maybe NextAll(:first) will have the desired effect
[06:59:31] <AL13N_work> not sure about performance though
[07:03:43] <computer2000> please help: ive been killing myself with this problem for 2 days now - im pulling in images with an $.ajax request, which works fine. but in a separate script, i need to alter these images, but only if and as soon as they have been loaded, not earlier ... the problem is that when I refresh the browser with command-r the ajax fires first and then the script, but when i reload the page by clicking on the correspondin

[07:07:03] <progzer> I'm generating some markup in a string and then using the append function to add it to an element. After that I'm trying to get the bounds of the viewport. The trace shows as though the page were blank (or all the content fit within the viewport).

[07:08:11] <pachet> computer2000: my guess is that they're actually just standard GET reqs, initiated by the browser
[07:08:41] <progzer> So is there another event I need to wait for? I'm tracing in the ready event as well. Is there a 'scrolled to last known location' type event?

[07:51:02] <dommer> lo
[07:51:22] <dommer> Got a quick question re support if anyone can help...
[07:51:39] <dommer> Am I right in thinknig that only the latest version of jquery is supported?
[07:51:56] <dommer> meaning that if i have issues on an older version, I will be told to upgrade to the latest version?
[07:52:13] <NoiseEee> it depends how old
[07:52:23] <dommer> 1.5.2 (March 31 2011)
[07:52:29] <dommer> or 1.4.2 (Feb 19 2010)
[07:52:34] <NoiseEee> thats pretty old, whats your issue
[07:53:07] <dommer> my issue is with a supplier who are saying that because we have updated their code to use a newer version of jquery they want to charge us loads of money to fix their bug. Nothing to do with jwuery
[07:53:21] <dommer> I just need an argument to tell them why we upgraded! :-D
[07:54:05] <dommer> But if i can say that only the current version is supported, so we have to upgrade, then it would help my case.
[07:55:50] <NoiseEee> well obviously upgrading addresses past bugs, improves performance, etc etc
[07:56:12] <dommer> exactly, that's what I thought. W ewere having an issue with something new not working
[07:56:47] <dommer> also, they had actually shipped the main page with jQueryTools which had jquery 1.4.2 embedded in it, so even though it looked like 1.5.2 they were in fact using 1.4.2
[07:56:54] <NoiseEee> well my uneducated guess would be that an (old) plugin that relies on the (old) jquery is probably out of date
[07:57:05] <NoiseEee> good luck with that :)
[07:57:08] <dommer> I agree. Thanks!
[07:57:09] <dommer> LOL!
[07:57:29] <dommer> It's deffo out of date. I upgraded it and they got upset.
[07:57:48] <dommer> I'd rather just fix the issue myself, but it's never that simple in the corporate world... :-$
[07:59:32] <danmichel> Is there a way for me to set the bottom margin of #post_media only on pages that have no text underneath it, like this one? http://varmag.com/jamie-vandyke-by-ted-emmons/
[08:05:49] <Francis47> Hello - can someone tell me why i cant get this closebutton working? http://jsfiddle.net/73M4U/
[08:13:19] <NoiseEee> Francis47:  $(this).parents('.ProductView')  not   $(this).parents(.ProductView)
[08:17:25] <Francis47> NoiseEee: Thanks man :)
[08:17:36] <grifx> Hello everone
[08:17:41] <grifx> I've got a problem
[08:18:13] <UtsClayton> most people do when they come here  :)
[08:18:41] <grifx> UtsClayton: :)
[08:18:47] <grifx> I've got the error : cannot call methods on slider prior to initialization; attempted to call method 'option'
[08:18:56] <grifx> I'm using jquery UI
[08:19:33] <dommer> Thanks for your help NoiseEee. Laters... :-)
[08:19:59] <grifx> But I initialize my sliders before to trying to set values
[08:21:26] <Marnix_IxD> If there is anyone with good knowledge of .post() or other AJAX calls around? Would you mind taking a look at http://forum.jquery.com/topic/how-do-i-generate-post-return-values-in-php? and help me understand?
[08:23:10] <systemfault> Marnix_IxD: I could help with ajax... but wordpress isn't really my thing
[08:23:26] <Marnix_IxD> just the ajax part will do ;)
[08:24:08] <systemfault> So, you would like to return values from PHP to the client?
[08:24:21] <Marnix_IxD> yeah that's what im going for
[08:24:59] <systemfault> So with PHP, you create an array() of everything you need to send then you echo the result of json_encode(theArray);
[08:25:28] <Marnix_IxD> ok? an echo statement is what becomes the return value?
[08:25:45] <systemfault> Marnix_IxD: JSON is just a string
[08:26:00] <systemfault> json_encode will create a string that contains all the info that was in the array
[08:26:08] <Marnix_IxD> ahhhh
[08:26:10] <systemfault> Then you just... echo it
[08:26:23] <Marnix_IxD> do I have to define a header for the echo?
[08:26:28] <Marnix_IxD> to state that its json?
[08:26:37] <systemfault> I was going to mention it, yes it would be appropriate
[08:27:14] <systemfault> header("Content-Type: application/json", true, 200); IIRC (It's been a while since I used this function)
[08:27:48] <Marnix_IxD> what does the true, 200 do?
[08:28:15] <systemfault> IIRC, true means (replace the current Content-Type if there's one)
[08:28:28] <systemfault> And 200 is the HTTP status code, 200 means "OK"
[08:28:39] <Marnix_IxD> ahhhh wonderful :D
[08:28:56] <edwin101> hi everyone, I'm new to Jquery ajax and i am unable to grasp the problem I'm having. Maybe someone here can guide me?
[08:29:01] <systemfault> If there's a problem.. you could use a code somewhere in the 4 hundreds
[08:29:01] <khaan> hey guys, i'm trying to use masonry with wordpress using this tutorial but it's not working. Is there any kind soul that can help me? http://www.wplover.com/1818/tutorial-using-jquery-masonry-with-wordpress/
[08:29:36] <systemfault> Marnix_IxD: A code in the 4xx or 500x would trigger the .fail handler on the client side ajax
[08:30:01] <fission6> edwin101: can you post some code in a pastebin or maybe jsfiddle to show your issue
[08:30:43] <khaan> ok, solved
[08:30:50] <khaan> thanks anyway guys :)
[08:31:03] <Marnix_IxD> @systemfault so when I put function(responseText, textStatus, jqXHR){} as the function that should be ran, should I do anything with the textStatus , jqXHR?
[08:31:39] <mg983> I am trying to find the first div with the class of item that does not have the class "dropped-from" -- what am I doing wrong?http://jsfiddle.net/6rZFZ/
[08:31:47] <Marnix_IxD> that is the function that is being ran when there is a successful ajax .post()
[08:32:05] <systemfault> Marnix_IxD: The good way nowadays is with the promises system.
[08:34:05] <systemfault> Marnix_IxD: var myPost = $.post(url, data, 'json'); myPost.done(function(whatIReceivedFromTheServer) { doSomethingWith(whatIReceivedFromTheServer); }); myPost.fail(function() { alert("shit"); });
[08:36:48] <kristofers> I'm trying to change some css whenever a value of an input changes the problem is it only notice the value changed whenever you click somewhere else
[08:36:56] <kristofers> i'm using .change
[08:40:02] <NoiseEee> kristofers: thats because the change event doesn't fire until the element loses focus
[08:44:11] <ezio> anyone know why $(context).on('click', '.ms-optgroup-container', function() { is not working but $(context).find('.ms-optgroup-label').on('click', function() { is
[08:44:56] <kristofers> NoiseEee: yep i needed to use keyup
[08:47:13] <sethetter> mg983: http://jsfiddle.net/6rZFZ/2/
[08:47:34] <sethetter> mg983: There was something wrong with returning from inside the each loop
[08:48:27] <mg983> sethetter: check out http://jsfiddle.net/6rZFZ/3/ it is still returning item-3, but it should be returning item-2
[08:49:27] <mg983> sethetter: i just need to check if its set and if it isn't set it … i think
[08:50:13] <mg983> sethetter: yeah http://jsfiddle.net/6rZFZ/4/
[08:50:17] <mg983> works
[08:51:56] <bil`> Can anyone help with a 'this' scoping problem I'm having inside an $.each() method? https://gist.github.com/f78097d3d9d3cadefd3e
[08:52:33] <sethetter> mg983: Awesome :)
[08:52:42] <mg983> Thanks !:)
[08:53:21] <systemfault> bil`: var that = this; just after declaring cityState... then use that instead of this inside the .each
[08:53:45] <bil`> er i keep forgetting that
[08:54:20] <bil`> I've never used $.proxy.. would that also work in this case or is that for event handlers?
[08:54:35] <systemfault> bil`: I never tried using .proxy with .each
[08:55:25] <systemfault> I wish $.each wouldn't exists....
[08:55:30] <systemfault> $.each also.
[08:55:33] <systemfault> Err $.map
[08:55:55] <bil`> what just use a for loop?
[08:56:04] <ajpiano> .....
[08:56:08] <systemfault> bil`: I use .each
[08:56:13] <sethetter> systemfault: ?!
[08:56:18] <ajpiano> systemfault: $.proxy works for any time you need to manipulate scope, including $.each etc
[08:56:51] <systemfault> ajpiano: Good to know, I wasn't sure because jQuery is already messing with "this"
[09:00:11] <systemfault> My problem with $.each and $.map is that they don't work like their JS equivalent... that's it.
[09:00:36] <ajpiano> and they predate their JS equivalent
[09:01:02] <ajpiano> it isn't hard to keep track of the different signatures in your head and if it is, your code breaks immediately and it's trivial to fix
[09:01:14] <systemfault> ajpiano: I think that jQuery shouldn't have added non-DOM utilities :(
[09:01:35] <ajpiano> mmkay
[09:02:48] <nitrix> Me and javascript... tsk tsk.... I do var t = $('.looks-hero-unit .product').map(function() {    return $(this).attr('sku');
[09:02:57] <nitrix> });
[09:03:02] <logikos_> if i'm loading an external javascript file in the body of my document then later want to execute a function from the file, will the $(document).ready( ) wait till the external js file is loaded to execute?
[09:03:04] <ajpiano> systemfault: when you say "added" you mean "had in version 1.0 right"
[09:03:09] <nitrix> How would I post that using $.POST ?
[09:03:23] <systemfault> ajpiano: I guess :P
[09:03:41] <nitrix> So far, tried serialize() and serializeArray(). Plain variable, and inside {} as well.
[09:03:44] <nitrix> :(
[09:04:04] <systemfault> nitrix: serialize* are for form input elements
[09:04:26] <nitrix> Is there anything else I could use to transform t into something $.POST would like ?
[09:04:27] <systemfault> nitrix: If you don't use them, you'll need to do your own object
[09:05:14] <nitrix> Blerh. Just tell me how, I'm sure you hav a paypal don't you ?
[09:06:37] <nitrix> console.debug() shows ["3125-705Z002", "3121-102A007", "3121-103A003"]  ..... so I must be only a few steps away to send it using $.POST
[09:06:52] <nitrix> I just hate the object/array system in Javascript.
[09:07:58] <MrFox> anyone in here ever used mapstraction, openlayers or openstreetmap? i'm just starting and could use a few words of advice.
[09:08:10] <ajpiano> nitrix: $(...).map(fn) returns a jQuery object, not an array
[09:08:14] <evilgeenius> Is there a way I can show an alert box if the user attempts to leave the page without clicking on the submit button?
[09:08:14] <ajpiano> it's a bit counterintuitive
[09:08:30] <ajpiano> nitrix: you need to do $("foo").map(fn).get().  that will give you the array
[09:08:55] <ajpiano> to send it over a post you have to stringify it using JSON.stringify or you can simply do array.join()
[09:08:55] <nitrix> ajpiano: I tried that. Hold on, i'll give you the output...
[09:09:15] <ajpiano> $.post(url, {data: JSON.stringify( $(".foo").map(fn).get() )});
[09:10:39] <nitrix> ajpiano: .get() writes 3125-705Z002,3121-102A007,3121-103A003 so I guess it's a string.....
[09:10:47] <nitrix> Okay i'll try 12:07:52
[09:12:50] <ajpiano> there are better ways to find out the type of a variable than guessing :p
[09:13:36] <nitrix> ajpiano: Works perfectly. I get a JSON array at the end-point. I promise I'll have a look later to understand all this. For the moment being, you saved me.
[09:13:40] <nitrix> ajpiano: You got paypal ?
[09:14:04] <ajpiano> nitrix: i do, but i'd rather you give to the jquery foundation than me :)
[09:14:08] <ajpiano> http://jquery.org/donate/
[09:14:54] <nitrix> ajpiano: you decide what you do with it after.
[09:15:01] <ajpiano> ok
[09:21:00] <zcreative> How can i build a twitter with jquery?
[09:21:08] <snover> u trollin bro
[09:21:18] <sethetter> zcreative: That's quite a question you've got there
[09:21:34] <bung> zcreative: you need the hash php bootzend framework cake
[09:21:48] <zcreative> bung: thanks. i'll google it
[09:22:10] <bung> with the stack-ui facespace plugin
[09:22:47] <bung> and the coffeeOOCSS eclipse studio fiddlebin is pretty popular right now
[09:23:05] <bung> if you need an editor :)
[09:23:33] <zcreative> no but foreal, anybody know of any twitter bootstrap jquery plugins?
[09:23:52] <bung> bootstrap comes with plugins
[09:23:58] <zcreative> right, but not a date picker
[09:24:02] <zcreative> etc...
[09:24:06] <bung> jquery ui ?
[09:24:37] <zcreative> i guess, but it doesnt look like twitter bootstrap
[09:24:47] <bung> so work your CSS magic
[09:24:48] <ajpiano> all of the twitter bootstrap plugins are... jquery plugins
[09:24:53] <bung> there are lots of jquery ui themes
[09:24:59] <ajpiano> https://github.com/twitter/bootstrap/tree/master/js
[09:25:06] <bung> there is a theme customizer you could make it look pretty close
[09:25:12] <ajpiano> if you want to create your own plugin, use those as an example and leverage the bootstrap classes
[09:25:48] <zcreative> i just did a quick google and found this. http://addyosmani.github.com/jquery-ui-bootstrap/
[09:26:19] <bung> damn google and its giving you answers easily
[09:26:29] <sethetter> zcreative: Google-first :)
[09:26:29] <bung> i hate how you could just google things like that
[09:26:47] <sethetter> bung: yeah, it's way too helpful..
[09:26:52] <bung> xD
[09:26:53] <zcreative> google is getting pretty smart
[09:27:02] <zcreative> http://lmgtfy.com i love this site
[09:27:08] <bung> i think i need a timeout, my scarcasm levels are too high
[09:27:09] <bung> bbiab
[09:28:23] <ajpiano> good call bung
[10:03:52] <computer2000> anyone can help me: when i use the conditional comments at the top of index.html from html5 boilderplate (to include classes for ie versions) i fall into quirks mode on IE8 ... whys that?
[10:14:01] <mtbf> Hi, could someone please invite me to #php?
[10:15:42] <systemfault> You don't need an invite, just register your nick to nickserv.
[10:16:33] <mtbf> systemfault: oh, ok, I though I was already identified, thnx.
[10:19:10] <K3|Chris> anyone spotted a tutorial/ready script for doing an "apple style" thumbnail hover effect? say I got 4 pictures, first one shows by default, and if you hover the left 1/4 of it, hover the 1/4 to the right and you get picture 2, etc
[10:19:44] <K3|Chris> next past the center 3, on the far right, 4
[10:23:46] <Dave_Stein> scott_gonzalez: Bug or a feature for UI 2.0 -> I see you added appendTo params on line 79. If I appendTo without a helper and preventDefault beforedragstart, it will still move the element where appendTo specified. Is that correct? Need answer to fix bug that makes element disappear off DOM
[10:37:18] <nagle5000> hi #jquery :). I am using .attr() to set add title attributes, and I'm finding it's working in Chrome but not Firefox. Does anyone have ideas about how to figure out what's happening there?
[10:40:39] <sethetter> nagle5000: try using .prop instead of .attr
[10:41:16] <alcuadrado> has anyone used the new jqueryui's tooltip? is it a good replacement for tipsy?
[10:41:57] <nagle5000> alcuadrado: i'm using jquery-ui's tooltips right now! but i haven't used tipsy
[10:42:30] <alcuadrado> I can't figure out how to use it on elements that don't have a title attr
[10:42:30] <Unlearn> for now qTip 2.0 really works
[10:43:23] <Emn1ty> what is the go-to jquery slider?
[10:43:25] <nagle5000> alcuadrado: that's what I'm playing with too right now -- there is a content option
[10:43:26] <Danny_B|backup> hi. what is the best way to turn one tag to another? say i have several <span class="tooption"> so i would like something like (pseudocode) $("select").appendeach( $("span.tooption").convertto("option") );
[10:44:35] <nagle5000> emn1ty: jquery-ui has a slider. i don't know if it's the best one though.
[10:45:20] <sethetter> Danny_B|backup: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2206892/jquery-convert-dom-element-to-different-type
[10:45:36] <alcuadrado> nagle5000, I think it doesn't work like that :(
[10:47:01] <nagle5000> alcuadrado: what do you mean? (as i'm just figuring out tooltip right now i'd love any clarification! :)
[10:48:00] <alcuadrado> it's intention is to replace the native tooltip of the browser
[10:48:06] <alcuadrado> not a generic tooltip
[10:48:16] <alcuadrado> so it only works with elements with title attr
[10:48:39] <alcuadrado> and I'm not willing to ad title attributes to anything, as I'm not sure how cross-browser that is
[10:49:25] <nagle5000> alcuadrado: I see. So there is http://api.jqueryui.com/tooltip/#option-content -- have you looked at that?
[10:52:05] <nagle5000> sethetter: i tried .prop but got the same problem with .attr (it only changed the title in chrome.) thanks though!
[10:52:28] <shoky> nagle5000: you want to change the tooltip?
[10:52:52] <nagle5000> shoky: yeah! ideally in a way that doesn't require adding a title tag in the html to every element
[10:53:47] <shoky> nagle5000: well you just pointed at the content option.. and there's also the 'items' option to put the tooltips on elements other than those with title attribute
[10:55:39] <alcuadrado> shoky, thanks! that also helps me :D
[10:58:51] <nagle5000> shoky: right! but i have yet to get it to work in Firefox and Chrome. (I can get those to work in chrome.)
[11:02:04] <pingu2> hi
[11:02:30] <MistuhKurtz> hey ping
[11:02:44] <pingu2> oh, hi MistuhKurtz
[11:03:20] <pingu2> im looking for someone good with plugins.  i have this jsfiddle http://jsfiddle.net/CTxVH/1/
[11:05:03] <pingu2> id like to find a way to pass "points", ideally something like easing cubicBezier(bezierControl(0.295, -0.260, 0.950, 0.185))
[11:05:59] <pingu2> any help appreciated or thoughts on the value in something like that as a plugin
[11:10:28] <shoky> nagle5000: to get what to work?
[11:10:55] <nagle5000> shoky: to get a tooltip whose content is set by the content options.
[11:11:21] <nagle5000> shaky; which somehow is only working for me in chrome -- i wasn't sure how to figure that out!
[11:11:25] <nagle5000> er shoky :)
[11:11:40] <shoky> here's some examples.. http://jsfiddle.net/FgGvE/3/
[11:13:04] <shoky> i just decided to use .data('tooltip')  to store the tooltip.. you can do it any way you want though
[11:15:33] <nagle5000> shoky: this is neat, thank you!

[11:59:57] <YammYcoding> but i wanted it to hide all other links but the clicked
[12:00:04] <YammYcoding> how could i change that to do so?
[12:00:57] <johnny22> i've seen this behaviour before..but can't remember how to fix
[12:01:20] <johnny22> my jquery ui tabs (current version ) are loading the document fragment as an ajax request
[12:01:56] <johnny22> i thought i remembered that being a common issue .. but now can't remember why
[12:07:38] <givemore> can someone please tell me why the form submit handler is not working on this page: http://www.givemore.com/test-jank/
[12:08:05] <givemore> if I remove the jquery validate code the php processes the form perfectly...
[12:08:48] <givemore> it is almost as if the jquery validate plugin does not hit the php processing code
[12:08:50] <louism2__> Hey everyone, I am trying to see if the color of an element is black and I am doing it like so: 	if($(this).next().css("color").toString() == 'rgb(0,0,0)') .  It seems like having the rgb value as a string is not working for the comparison.  Any have any other ideas on how I could do the comparison?
[12:08:54] <givemore> any ideas?
[12:10:05] <shoky> YammYcoding: http://jsfiddle.net/amTXd/2/
[12:10:59] <dblosevn> Hey :-)
[12:11:03] <dblosevn> http://jsbin.com/uyutel/3/edit
[12:11:16] <shoky> YammYcoding: sorry, http://jsfiddle.net/amTXd/3/
[12:11:17] <givemore> @louism2 how about "($(this).next().css("color") == 'black'"
[12:11:24] <dblosevn> Anybody got a quick and dirty to make the second slider go from left to right?
[12:11:29] <louism2__> givemore: that doesn't work either
[12:12:59] <givemore> $(this).next().css("background-color") == 'black';
[12:13:17] <givemore> the color property only works with text
[12:13:24] <EHLOVader> louism2__: have you tried looking at what the CSS value returns? I am thinking it may be spacing in the string 'rgb(0, 0, 0)'
[12:13:48] <tipdbmp> How can I prevent the default action of an anchor <a>, i.e go to another page when clicked but still make it change it's color to as if it really was visited?
[12:13:49] <louism2__> ehllvader: ill give that a shot
[12:14:30] <tipdbmp> And actually make the browser remember that this link was visited.
[12:14:35] <scott_gonzalez> Dave_Stein: Sounds like a bug. It shouldn't move until after that event. #jqueryui-dev is a better place to ask questions like that.
[12:15:08] <YammYcoding> shoky leme see :)
[12:15:51] <AnonymousPrime> jQuery color has getters for colors that wil format consistently for testing: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-color
[12:16:33] <YammYcoding> shoky i can't see your link
[12:16:51] <AnonymousPrime> louism2__ check the getters/setters section and string methods below it
[12:17:23] <YammYcoding> shoky dont you need a user after the .net/ ?
[12:18:13] <givemore> anyone have any ideas what my submit handler issue may be?
[12:18:41] <juboba> how can I select arrays of inputs? i.e. <input type="text" name="input[1]" /><input type="text" name="input[2]" /><input type="text" name="input[3]" />?
[12:19:07] <juboba> $('[name="input"]') does not work
[12:19:37] <louism2__> ehlovader: that worked
[12:19:43] <louism2__> ehlovader: thanks everyone for the help
[12:19:58] <YammYcoding> shoky?
[12:21:34] <shoky> YammYcoding: no you dont need a user..
[12:22:48] <AnonymousPrime> givemore yr talking about the form under the video?
[12:23:03] <givemore> yes
[12:23:31] <AnonymousPrime> looks like it's working to me...i put in valid info and it sends the data to the server
[12:23:32] <givemore> if i allow php to process the form it works correctly
[12:24:09] <givemore> right, it looks like it serialized it fine, but it is not connecting with the php to send out the form information
[12:25:57] <AnonymousPrime> the response from yr post submit contains the html of the page you are currently on
[12:26:04] <AnonymousPrime> i don't think it's catching that it's a post action
[12:26:17] <EHLOVader> anyone here know of a good jquery based plugin to allow spreadsheet like data entry with paste from excel?
[12:26:46] <givemore> how can i check for that anonymousPrime?
[12:27:26] <AnonymousPrime> in your php code you need to detect if the request is a post, and if so, do your work on the data posted
[12:27:49] <EHLOVader> actually givemore I am also seeing it post and the page comes back... but without a form this time
[12:28:16] <givemore> so you think it is the same issue vader?
[12:28:45] <EHLOVader> well I see it post to the server http://i.imgur.com/ISEcT.png
[12:29:15] <EHLOVader> I don't get any affirmative response, but page reloads without the form http://i.imgur.com/u5GYT.png
[12:29:28] <givemore> I am checking if the submit button was clicked with "if(isset($_POST['fullVideoEvalSubmit']))"
[12:29:30] <EHLOVader> related to lemonstand do you have the flash message on the page, or are you returning or using the flash message?
[12:30:17] <givemore> does that now detect if the request is a post?
[12:30:29] <EHLOVader> some button values aren't sent that way, you should probably just check to see if the request method is post
[12:30:33] <EHLOVader>  if($_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD'] == 'POST')
[12:30:34] <givemore> vader, no I am not using flash message
[12:31:21] <YammYcoding> shoky i click the link you gave, but it errors
[12:32:01] <YammYcoding> shoky oh no, it worked now. let me see =D
[12:32:53] <YammYcoding> shoky wow this is perfect! thanks!
[12:33:15] <givemore> ohh snap!
[12:33:18] <relipse> hey guys can you test out my new website (i used jquery and yui) http://cworklog.com
[12:33:25] <givemore> looks like the checking for post may have worked!!
[12:34:04] <YammYcoding> shoky what is that notation?
[12:34:14] <givemore> should I also still check to see if the submit button is set?
[12:34:22] <shoky> YammYcoding: what notation?
[12:34:31] <YammYcoding> this is a single line of code?  $(this).next('div').slideToggle("fast") .siblings('div').slideUp("fast");
[12:34:42] <shoky> yes, it's called chaining
[12:34:48] <YammYcoding> how it works?
[12:35:00] <YammYcoding> its the same as $(this).siblings.. ?
[12:35:11] <dblosevn> ok... got the slide direction figured out, but anybody got a solution for me for this? http://jsbin.com/uyutel/3/edit
[12:35:34] <dblosevn> you can see the slide busting out of the container while its sliding on the bottom box
[12:35:52] <EHLOVader> givemore:  are you using different buttons for the one form?
[12:35:59] <EHLOVader> or having mutliple forms post to that single backend page?
[12:36:15] <givemore> multiple forms will be on the same page yes
[12:36:16] <Kevin-_-> Hello, I'm doing a drag n drop list, and I have a function that inserts into a database, but I return back a value when it doesn't meet the conditions.  I'm trying to remove that element form the list when that happens, but I can't get it to work correctly.
[12:36:21] <Kevin-_-> Here's what I'm trying to do: $( "<li name='" + semester_year +"'></li>" ).remove(ui.draggable.text());
[12:36:43] <shoky> YammYcoding: it's the same as:  var nextDiv = $(this).next('div'); nextDiv.slideToggle('fast'); var siblings = nextDiv.sibilings('div'); siblings.slideUp('fast');
[12:37:32] <Kevin-_-> Was wondering if someone could help me get that working?
[12:38:17] <shoky> Kevin-_-:  $( "<li name='" + semester_year +"'></li>" )  creates a new <li> element
[12:38:25] <Kevin-_-> ah ok
[12:38:53] <Kevin-_-> What should I do with that then, just $(semester_year).remove(element) then?
[12:39:20] <shoky> ?remove @ Kevin-_-
[12:39:21] <bot-t> Kevin-_-, .remove([selector]): Remove the set of matched elements from the DOM. http://api.jquery.com/remove/
[12:39:36] <Kevin-_-> ok thanks
[12:39:45] <shoky> Kevin-_-: http://docs.jquery.com/Tutorials:Getting_Started_with_jQuery
[12:40:36] <EHLOVader> then givemore if you are using the javascript to submit the form you may have to embed or inject the button's value into the form serialization
[12:40:48] <EHLOVader> not sure if the jquery library counts the button that was pressed in that manner
[12:41:18] <EHLOVader> but most libraries do offer a way to "inject" json data into the serialised form, as though they were inputs
[12:44:20] <givemore> I have used almost the exact same code a few times before, and it has worked checking for a set submit button ...
[12:45:04] <EHLOVader> almost is only good in horseshoes and hand grenades
[12:45:08] <EHLOVader> or something like that
[12:45:10] <YammYcoding> shoky thank you@
[12:45:19] <darrennnn> hi #jquery, popping in for a personal recommendation -- i am looking to achieve the effect where one scrolls down the page and when they pass a certain element, that element all of a sudden becomes stuck in the window as you continue to scroll. if you scroll back up it returns to its original position.
[12:45:20] <darrennnn> thoughts?

[12:50:32] <givemore> thank you EHLOVader and AnonymousePrime!
[12:50:47] <darrennnn> gnarf: looking. seems quite full featured. offhand, can you think of any others?
[12:50:57] <darrennnn> this pin functionality is what i am looking for in scrollorama
[12:51:01] <gnarf> darrennnn: nope http://johnpolacek.github.com/superscrollorama/ too
[12:51:33] <gnarf> darrennnn: its the only one i've seen, and I haven't even tried using it
[12:51:44] <gnarf> just looked solid on cursory review of the api and code
[12:52:49] <gnarf> had a catchy name too :)
[12:55:20] <darrennnn> haha true.
[12:55:24] <darrennnn> very catchy indeed.

[12:57:59] <timwis> Hey guys, I have a jQuery Mobile app and I'm trying to fetch content to display on the front page, immediately when the app is loaded (preferably before document.ready). How do I line this up with page loads so the loading indicator will show and i can do a .trigger("create") on the fetched markup, but only if the page has already been initialised?
[12:58:52] <scriabin> jquery ui lets me create widgets which are opinioonated and standardized and that's nice.  Is there some sort of framework for building an app soup to nuts which uses these widgets?  I'm thinking of something like active_admin for rails but not just for the admin interface, but for the whole app.  So developers don't have to pick colors and gradients and icons and crap - they'll just be picked for you and you can customize if you w
[12:59:45] <ryanneufeld> timwis: read the events portion of the docs
[13:00:28] <timwis> ryanneufeld: I have, quite extensively. It doesn't appear to answer a question like this
[13:04:15] <vro> how can i add a click listener to an element i just inserted?
[13:04:43] <pifantastic> vro: how are you inserting it?
[13:04:46] <timwis> vro: http://api.jquery.com/live/
[13:04:56] <vro> append
[13:04:58] <pifantastic> vro: an element does not have to be in the DOM for you to register events
[13:05:15] <pifantastic> also
[13:05:18] <pifantastic> ?on @ vro
[13:05:18] <bot-t> vro, .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements, including delegation and live binding. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[13:05:26] <shoky> TelFiRE: what do you mean, "legit"?
[13:05:41] <TelFiRE> like not hacky/unlikely to break other stuff
[13:05:58] <shoky> i don't see anything wrong with it.. duno
[13:06:01] <TelFiRE> and not a resource hog that will cause old browsers to choke
[13:06:48] <shoky> well.. it'll hog as much as that css change hogs ;p
[13:08:34] <pingu2> hi.  does anyone know how i might pass an extra variable to an easing function like this here jsfiddle? http://jsfiddle.net/CTxVH/2/ ?
[13:10:06] <pingu2> see how i have easing: 'cubicBezier'?  id like to pass it values like (0.190, 1.000, 0.680, 0.285), but...  im not sure it's possible
[13:10:17] <sphera> While not specifically a jquery question, is anyone familiar with the rickshaw graphing library? I have a question on SO that's gone untouched, and I think it is just some subtle error that I'm missing.
[13:10:26] <sphera> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13285416/rickshaw-only-plots-one-point-instead-of-series
[13:10:33] <johnny22> so what reason could there be for jquery tabs to use load via ajax when clicking a tab when the href is a document fragment and not a page
[13:10:55] <sphera> tl;dr Rickshaw is only plotting one point, much to my chagrin
[13:11:22] <timwis> Hey guys, I have a jQuery Mobile app and I'm trying to fetch content to display on the front page, immediately when the app is loaded (preferably before document.ready). How do I line this up with page loads so the loading indicator will show and i can do a .trigger("create") on the fetched markup, but only if the page has already been initialised?
[13:14:13] <vro> alright well if I'm appending li's into a ul should I be adding an event listener to each li as I add it or creating one listener for all li's, sorry if thats a dumb question
[13:15:22] <NoiseEee> vro: a single listener on the <ul>
[13:15:46] <NoiseEee> $('#myUL').on('whatever','li',function() { })
[13:16:23] <dblosevn> How can I keep these 2 sliders in sync with each other, http://jsbin.com/uyutel/6 after a while they get way out of sync

[13:17:48] <dblosevn> never mind somebody changed the images so it doesnt work at all now lol
[13:20:29] <fission6> anyone use sulime text 2, curious how you format your js

[13:24:30] <timwis> Hey guys, I have a jQuery Mobile app and I'm trying to fetch content to display on the front page, immediately when the app is loaded (preferably before document.ready). How do I line this up with page loads so the loading indicator will show and i can do a .trigger("create") on the fetched markup, but only if the page has already been initialised?
[13:24:50] <shoky> pingu2: prolly not what you meant but maybe it's closer.. http://jsfiddle.net/CTxVH/5/
[13:26:33] <pingu2> shoky: thanks. it kind of defeats the object a bit doing it like that
[13:27:33] <shoky> what object
[13:28:30] <pingu2> the idea was to be able to pass css3-style cubic-bezier points (bit like this) http://matthewlein.com/ceaser/
[13:31:26] <shoky> isn't that what you're doing?
[13:33:00] <pingu2> shoky: i think it'd break down if you wanted more than one .animate.  perhaps if there were two different easing styles needed
[13:33:31] <shoky> and isn't that what i was doing?
[13:33:46] <goddard> i have a button and i change the text when clicked
[13:33:58] <goddard> but when i do that it looses the look of the jquery ui button
[13:34:03] <pingu2> yes but..
[13:35:56] <shoky> goddard: how are you changing the text
[13:36:07] <pingu2> shoky ^ ok, no 'but'.  it's a nice technique, but it's still not really plugin material, if you get me
[13:36:52] <shoky> pingu2: like i said, i only took the next step ;p
[13:37:05] <shoky> well i didnt say that but i meant it with "maybe its closer" ;p
[13:37:21] <shoky> er donno why i bothered with that .bind
[13:38:08] <shoky> simpler http://jsfiddle.net/CTxVH/6/
[13:38:50] <pingu2> shoky: i think im done with it for now.  feel free to make it your own if you have the bug
[13:40:00] <pingu2> i actually um...
[13:41:26] <pingu2> the point initially was to replicate css3 easing on a non-cssable property like window scroll http://jsfiddle.net/vjR98/4/
[13:42:46] <pingu2> i found some bezier functions on a site, had a play around minimising things, thought it might be easy to make a plugin.  but that wasnt really my project and i need to stop.  appreciate the effort though : )
[13:44:13] <goddard> shoky: i am using $(this).text('blah')
[14:02:27] <ss> Is this channel a good place to ask a JavaScript-related (not jQuery specific) question (I'm not going to ask anything about JavaScript/jQuery right now but I'm probably going to do so in the future)?
[14:03:09] <rgr> yes
[14:05:01] <ss> I guess that most of the people here are also in ##javascript and vice versa.
[14:05:05] <TelFiRE> How do I make it so I bind colorbox to all elements with a certain class that appear on the page? Regardless of whether they are there at load?
[14:06:00] <TelFiRE> ss: best to ask raw js questions there and jquery questions here, but there's obviously some overlap. I don't mind answering questions that aren't technically jQuery, but it pisses some off more than others
[14:06:29] <TelFiRE> although let's be real here. I'm usually asking questions, not answering them
[14:09:33] <ss> TelFiRE, thanks, I'll keep that in mind and I'll try to not piss "some of the others" off. :)

[14:32:02] <MaxMeents> wow, how the hell does that work??
[14:32:50] <shoky> i goes from 0 to 7  because you have 8 .objImgAct elements
[14:33:06] <shoky> another way: http://jsfiddle.net/mKQKv/5/
[14:34:09] <MaxMeents> I will mess with that until I understand =) thank you
[14:35:27] <shoky> probably better: http://jsfiddle.net/mKQKv/6/
[14:35:49] <MaxMeents> ah, that I understand!
[14:36:07] <shoky> or: http://jsfiddle.net/mKQKv/7/
[14:36:14] <MaxMeents> its been a good 8 or 9 months since I wrote anything, just now getting back into it
[14:36:51] <shoky> the i % 4  works because it makes it cycle: 0,1,2,3,0,1,2,3

[14:41:08] <oojacoboo> if I have an html string, how I can remove a node from the string and all child nodes
[14:41:34] <oojacoboo> string = $(string).find("#selector").remove(); ?
[14:48:10] <systemfault> oojacoboo: Looks good but that won't return what you want
[14:48:16] <oojacoboo> syborg:
[14:48:21] <oojacoboo> systemfault: yea, I'm seeing that
[14:48:28] <oojacoboo> I think I need .prop("outerHTML")
[14:48:37] <oojacoboo> or something along those lines to pull it back to a string
[14:48:48] <systemfault> Why would you need a string though?
[14:49:05] <oojacoboo> I'm parsing a template, I do a lot of replace()
[14:49:24] <systemfault> Ah ok
[14:49:28] <oojacoboo> I'd think that'd be a lot faster than keeping an object around
[14:49:36] <oojacoboo> plus I don't want to rewrite all this logic
[14:50:17] <systemfault> jQuery doesn't have outerHTML afaik so you'll probably need to hack it (Or use the native one if you don't care about older browsers)
[14:50:34] <oojacoboo> systemfault: what do you mean?
[14:51:17] <oojacoboo> I'm seeing examples of something like… var html = $('<div>').append($('#top').clone()).remove().html();
[14:51:21] <oojacoboo> but wow that looks nasty
[14:52:07] <oojacoboo> .clone() being the trick there
[14:52:08] <b-ot> oojacoboo, 1 object in it (only a f.e.), and i want to do y if there are serveral objects in it
[14:52:28] <oojacoboo> b-ot: sorry, I don't understand what you're saying
[14:52:29] <b-ot> oojacoboo, no YOU'RE saying
[14:52:44] <systemfault> oojacoboo: It's pretty much what you need to do
[14:52:48] <oojacoboo> b-ot: I dont' understand your English
[14:52:59] <oojacoboo> systemfault: *sigh*
[14:53:08] <systemfault> oojacoboo: You won't need to clone though
[14:53:14] <oojacoboo> mm
[14:53:25] <systemfault> The clone is done to not affect the existing nodes
[14:53:37] <systemfault> In your case, you don't care about those, I think
[14:53:44] <oojacoboo> systemfault: I tried .html() that didn't work
[14:53:56] <systemfault> .html() will return the innerHTML
[14:54:12] <oojacoboo> yea...
[14:54:20] <oojacoboo> .outerHTML ?
[14:54:23] <pingu2> oojacoboo: make a jsfiddle?
[14:54:24] <systemfault> Since you want the innerHTML, the hack is to create a dummy element, put all the nodes in it then get the innerHTML (.html())
[14:54:40] <systemfault> Err... you want the outerHTML
[14:54:44] <oojacoboo> yea
[14:56:15] <systemfault> var nodes = $(string); nodes.find("#selector").remove(); ? $('<div></div>').append(nodes).html(); (Something like that)
[14:57:30] <oojacoboo> systemfault: but I'm left with an object, I want to have a string of the html assigned back to the var
[14:57:52] <oojacoboo> can I not chain those methods as well, why all the var assignment?
[14:59:12] <niels__> When using .on click instead of .live the ajax only works once, second time it submits the actual form. can't figure out why.. anyone? http://pastebin.com/6kphZdEm
[14:59:26] <oojacoboo> niels__: you're refreshing the DOM then
[14:59:37] <oojacoboo> live will keep an open listener for the matching element
[14:59:44] <oojacoboo> click expects that element to be in the DOM on load
[15:00:07] <systemfault> oojacoboo: I think you can with .end() but I never use it as I consider any usage of it as being an abuse of chaining
[15:00:13] <niels__> oojacoboo: okay, but.. i thought i *shouldn't* ever use .live in 1.7+
[15:00:25] <TelFiRE> Any significant performance impact between find() and children()?
[15:00:28] <oojacoboo> niels__: use .on()
[15:00:31] <oojacoboo> it's all the same
[15:00:48] <niels__> oojacoboo: did you see my pastebin code? can't get it to work with .on
[15:01:29] <oojacoboo> niels__: on('submit', 'element', function(event)
[15:01:45] <oojacoboo> submit is an event
[15:01:53] <oojacoboo> you don't need an element in your case either
[15:02:04] <oojacoboo> so… .on('submit', function(event)
[15:02:25] <goddard> i have a button and i change the text when clicked but when i do that it looses the look of the jquery ui button
[15:02:28] <goddard> i am using $(this).text('blah')
[15:02:34] <javalover> hi everyone
[15:02:47] <niels__> oojacoboo: just tested, same result. works the first time, not the second time. then it fires the form.
[15:02:56] <oojacoboo> goddard: does the button have children elements?
[15:03:09] <oojacoboo> if so, you need to find the element within the button that has the text
[15:03:17] <goddard> no
[15:03:22] <oojacoboo> niels__: you're gonna need a live exmaple then
[15:03:27] <shoky> goddard: try $(this).button('option', 'label', 'blah');
[15:03:54] <goddard> i am using the split button
[15:03:55] <goddard> http://jqueryui.com/button/#splitbutton
[15:05:47] <goddard> PERFECT!!!
[15:05:49] <goddard> THANK YOU
[15:08:54] <shoky> TelFiRE: of course.. find() is recursive, children() is not
[15:09:23] <oojacoboo> systemfault: http://jsfiddle.net/cr3vQ/1/
[15:10:02] <oojacoboo> I get undefined with all other attempts
[15:10:24] <oojacoboo> I guess I could start a whole bunch of var assignment, but I'd really like to keep this clean, I have enough going on already
[15:10:56] <oojacoboo> obv that's getting the innerHTML, outerHTML returns undefined as well
[15:12:04] <systemfault> oojacoboo http://jsfiddle.net/cr3vQ/2/
[15:12:56] <oojacoboo> systemfault: this fixes the testcase, but won't work for me
[15:13:09] <oojacoboo> that's just an example, you kinda cheated :P
[15:13:26] <systemfault> Ah!
[15:13:31] <systemfault> Right, it won't work
[15:14:12] <systemfault> oojacoboo http://jsfiddle.net/cr3vQ/3
[15:14:16] <systemfault> That should do it
[15:14:21] <oojacoboo> systemfault: http://jsfiddle.net/cr3vQ/4/
[15:14:59] <systemfault> Yours still doesn't work
[15:15:02] <systemfault> Mine is good :P
[15:15:13] <oojacoboo> systemfault: you're assumes I have the ability to append
[15:15:21] <oojacoboo> I have a var that's been manipulated prior
[15:15:53] <systemfault> You have no choice if you need to support older browsers
[15:16:11] <oojacoboo> older as in?
[15:16:17] <oojacoboo> where is the flaw in the support there?
[15:16:32] <systemfault> oojacoboo http://jsfiddle.net/cr3vQ/5/ that version is with outerHTML
[15:16:42] <oojacoboo> I can't take an html string, convert to a jquery object, manipulate as needed and return to string?
[15:16:47] <systemfault> oojacoboo: I think it's old firefox that wasn't supporting it
[15:17:02] <oojacoboo> systemfault: that doesn't work in chrome
[15:17:16] <oojacoboo> I tried that a while ago
[15:17:17] <systemfault> I just tested it in chrome..
[15:17:23] <systemfault> That's my dev browser
[15:17:25] <oojacoboo> so did I, no go Chrome Canary
[15:17:46] <oojacoboo> wait
[15:17:49] <oojacoboo> you're just logging
[15:18:00] <shoky> what better way to see what's going on?
[15:18:00] <oojacoboo> yep, that works
[15:18:04] <systemfault> http://jsfiddle.net/cr3vQ/6/
[15:18:13] <oojacoboo> right
[15:18:14] <oojacoboo> thanks
[15:18:18] <systemfault> You're welcome
[15:20:13] <oojacoboo> you'd think there'd be a cleaner way of using jquery's dom manipulation tools for strings
[15:20:31] <oojacoboo> I guess it'd be easier to just leave it as a jquery object
[15:20:44] <systemfault> I don't think so... in fact, it's dirtier to play with strings
[15:21:21] <oojacoboo> yea, I'd agree
[15:21:27] <systemfault> My wife too :/
[15:21:30] <oojacoboo> lol
[15:21:42] <oojacoboo> it's probably faster though ;)
[15:21:51] <systemfault> Nah
[15:21:57] <systemfault> Well... you're somehow right
[15:22:07] <systemfault> innerHTML and company are faster on older browsers
[15:22:22] <systemfault> On recent ones, pure DOM calls are faster
[15:22:38] <oojacoboo> surely string manipulation is faster than running a bunch of methods on an object
[15:22:43] <oojacoboo> less overhead too
[15:23:24] <systemfault> I thought that too..
[15:23:48] <oojacoboo> systemfault: that's incorrect?
[15:24:50] <systemfault> oojacoboo: In all the benchmarks I've seen, on recent browser.. a ton of DOM calls is faster than a single innerHTML
[15:25:06] <oojacoboo> wow
[15:25:10] <systemfault> There are tons of example en jsperf
[15:25:12] <systemfault> http://jsperf.com/innerhtml-vs-createelement/9
[15:25:54] <systemfault> http://jsperf.com/dom-vs-innerhtml/26
[15:26:01] <sunbeam> I've got $("nav#side-navigation > ul > li") - I want to check whether this so the first ul > li of that nav has children (ul li). if it has not I want to assign a class to it.. how i best do this?
[15:26:01] <TelFiRE> I have "body" as a cached selector of my body tag. Is this the most efficient way to select these asides with the class details? body.find('#rx_featured aside.details')
[15:26:17] <systemfault> Have fun http://jsperf.com/search?q=innerHTML :P
[15:26:20] <oojacoboo> interesting systemfault
[15:32:39] <joules> hi, I'm new to jquery (and js libs and frameworks) I need to replace some onclick attributes, what about dialogs? are the built in confirm/alert/prompt, still callable within jquery?
[15:33:08] <vro> what should I be looking at using to animate a li item sliding to a new position in a ul?
[15:33:25] <codechewing> joules: yes, use the alert() function
[15:34:07] <joules> cool thanks.
[15:35:12] <joules> codechewing: i see you can replace them with jqueryUI dialogs, but seems rather heavy.
[15:36:10] <codechewing> joules: yeah - could be worth doing though. standard alert boxes are real old school now.
[15:37:22] <joules> might sound stupid but I'd prefer to create my own, UI's.
[15:37:29] <joules> using jquery.
[15:37:34] <Jon47> standard alert boxes look really nice on mobile devices though
[15:37:53] <Jon47> actually they look decent in modern browsers too
[15:38:04] <oojacoboo> browsers should integrate a really cool alert() interface
[15:38:05] <Jon47> i like how in safari they zoom in like a desktop widget
[15:38:51] <Jon47> and they are totally blocking, which i imagine has its uses..
[15:40:21] <joules> Jon47: why would it be more "totally blocking" than total screen fixed container?
[15:40:47] <joules> entire.
[15:41:19] <someprimetime> i think he means blocking as in js execution halts?
[15:41:21] <shoky> it blocks the javascript thread
[15:41:41] <joules> oh yes sorry.
[15:42:11] <someprimetime> anyone here read eloquent javascript?
[15:42:21] <coldhead> i have
[15:42:29] <someprimetime> skimming through it now.. it worth it?
[15:42:32] <coldhead> the terrarium is fun
[15:42:39] <someprimetime> i've read the good parts and js patterns by stoyan
[15:43:11] <someprimetime> is the terrarium a project of some sort you make within the book?
[15:43:13] <coldhead> hmm, if you've already read those you might not need to bother
[15:43:19] <coldhead> yes it is
[15:43:56] <coldhead> i would recommend it if you're still not sure how you want to organise your code
[15:44:00] <someprimetime> i always find i understand stuff better the more i expose myself to it, so i may just read it.. it looks pretty short i could probably read it on BART on my way to work
[15:44:01] <coldhead> files and functions and so on
[15:44:13] <qom2> hm, trying to get this: http://jsfiddle.net/qSU3Z/2/ to work in jquery 1.7.1, any ideas? works perfectly 1.8.2, but I'm not in position to update..
[15:44:13] <someprimetime> coldhead: actually that's something i'd like to know how to do better
[15:44:17] <coldhead> yes, if you know the basics you'll zip through it
[15:44:21] <someprimetime> nice
[15:46:29] <coldhead> qom2: http://jsfiddle.net/qSU3Z/4/
[15:46:38] <coldhead> fixed it in the course of making it more readable
[15:46:44] <coldhead> (or i hope so)
[15:47:28] <sunbeam> I've got $("nav#side-navigation > ul > li") - I want to check whether this so the first ul > li of that nav has children (ul li). if it has not I want to assign a class to it.. how i best do this?
[15:47:46] <qom2> yeah, much better, but I realized it's not right, it should make those without .cmspo-state red
[15:47:52] <qom2> not the other way around
[15:48:07] <coldhead> so lose the not()
[15:48:53] <qom2> but that doesn't seem logical, or?
[15:49:06] <coldhead> i don't know man, it's a complex selector
[15:49:59] <coldhead> qom2: http://jsfiddle.net/qSU3Z/6/ ?
[15:50:11] <coldhead> sunbeam: can you put your code on jsfiddle?
[15:50:16] <qom2> yes, that's right
[15:50:21] <qom2> thanks alot coldhead
[15:50:26] <qom2> was going crazy there
[15:50:30] <someprimetime> sunbeam: do something like if (!$(#side-navigation > ul > li').length > 0)) { $('#side-navigation > ul').addClass('class'); }
[15:50:40] <coldhead> don't try to chain so much together, qom2, it makes it harder to debug
[15:51:06] <someprimetime> take out the not in there actually
[15:51:11] <qom2> yeah, I'm still learning so it's pretty much a trial and error process
[15:51:21] <someprimetime> if ($(#side-navigation > ul > li').length > 0))
[15:51:22] <qom2> but it didn't look pretty, that's for sure
[15:52:00] <coldhead> how rude, someprimetime
[16:04:58] <ejo> How do I get from the event thrown by a contextmenu <menuitem> that has been clicked, to the DOM element that the mouse pointer was in/on when the contextmenu was invoked?  Do I have to actually save a reference to the latter at the time of the contextmenu event and use that?  Or is there something more direct i can do at the time the <menuitem> is clicked?
[16:09:24] <ejo> hmm, some stackoverflow Qs came up for this, will probably get me there
[16:10:00] <coldhead> ejo: e.target does not suffice?
[16:10:09] <coldhead> wanna put your code up on jsfiddle?
[16:11:45] <sunbeam> how can i check if the current <a> clicked contains another ul li menu?
[16:12:03] <gabrieluk> hey there, I would like to know if in order to know how to work with ajax(), I need to learn also seer side programming. just a superficial knowledge is enough?
[16:12:16] <gabrieluk> serer*
[16:12:20] <gabrieluk> server**
[16:14:26] <systemfault> You would need basic server-side programming to create HTTP services
[16:15:25] <ejo> coldhead: e.target points to the menuitem that was clicked.  turns out that document.activeElement refers to the element upon which the contextmenu was activated and that's exactly what I needed.
[16:15:55] <sunbeam> coldhead: any idea maybe
[16:16:19] <gabrieluk> systemfault, i'm able to have a node.js server running. nothing fancy, just an express app, setting the routes, etc
[16:16:44] <coldhead> sunbeam: if ($(this).find('ul li').length > 0) { /* yup */ }
[16:17:09] <coldhead> gabrieluk: so the amount you need to know depends on how much more complicated it gets. databases and so on
[16:18:03] <MindSpark> hi, can someone help me out with a page?
[16:18:08] <gabrieluk> coldhead, I see... I have not much exp with db. I'm playing with mongoose right now, it seems easy.
[16:18:09] <MindSpark> http://176.34.22.164/thrillseeker/about/
[16:18:27] <MindSpark> I am getting an error TypeError: 'undefined' is not a function (evaluating '$('#tabs').tabs()')
[16:18:37] <MindSpark> however jquery and jquery-ui are both included and loaded
[16:18:45] <sunbeam> coldhead: thanks
[16:19:20] <coldhead> MindSpark: which line of the HTML are you seeing UI being included?
[16:19:22] <coldhead> i don't see it
[16:20:25] <MindSpark> coldhead: oh, right, it loads when I am logged in. One moment, I will need to include it manually now
[16:21:35] <sphera> Anyone familiar with rickshaw? While I'm using all this stuff based on jq/d3/etc, should I be asking in a different room? I have an SO question here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13285416/rickshaw-only-plots-one-point-instead-of-series
[16:23:44] <bubu> yay coldhead is here!
[16:24:50] <coldhead> i am always with you, bubu. in your heart
[16:24:54] <coldhead> like a woman's love
[16:25:25] <bubu> so that means youre going to stab it at some point down the road?
[16:25:49] <gabrieluk> sphera, rickshaw is a lib that is in my list of development. unfortunately I haven't used, but I'm willing to do it. perhaps if you cannot get a quick answer, i could help you to think what is wrong and in the mean time get a bit familar with it. i'm good with vanilla js.
[16:28:25] <sphera> gabrieluk: Yeah, I'm in the same boat.
[16:29:32] <sphera> gabrieluk: The disturbing thing is that while `data: points` does not work properly (plots one point), `data: [ points[0], points[1] ]` plots two points
[16:29:45] <gabrieluk> maybe we make #rickshaw ?
[16:29:50] <sphera> and i'm double checking that points is indeed an array of the type expected (otherwise, it wouldn't plot at all)
[16:30:22] <sphera> gabrieluk: I don't quite think that's necessary. :)
[16:31:14] * sphera is leaning toward it being a problem with an underlying library somewhere, but no exceptions are thrown, so very hard to debug
[16:35:26] <Swimming_Bird> I'm setting data-id and it's a mongo objectid. The problem is sometimes the objectid can be all numbers but it's too big for a standard int and turns it into an exponential. any way to make sure the parser treats it as a string?
[16:40:24] <coldhead> Swimming_Bird: prefix it with something like _
[16:40:27] <coldhead> and remove it later
[16:40:33] <Swimming_Bird> ah good idea
[16:46:39] <coachz> hi all
[16:49:14] <Guest51994> can someone help  me with http://jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#custom-data
[16:49:21] <coachz> i have a project with 4 columns and using jQuery UI sortable that lets us drag divs around  Is there any way to make is to some of my divs can span more than one column and move the other divs out of the way ?
[16:50:04] <coachz> here is an example  http://jqueryui.com/sortable/#display-grid
[16:50:24] <coachz> i would like to be able to change the class of some to span multiple columns and push the other elements out of the way
[16:51:21] <coachz> is that even possible ?
[16:53:05] <coldhead> i doubt it coachz
[16:53:09] <coldhead> sorry
[16:53:43] <coachz> so i would probably have to write the code from scratch and be a CSS guru to do it ?
[16:56:34] <basso_> HI, i have a bullet style navigation. It's one long horizontal page divided in sections. When bullets are pressed, you scroll to a certain number of pixels on the page. I got this to work with scrollLeft. What I want to have now, is when the page is scrolled to a certain width, is make the appropriate bullet active (image flip). Any hints or help is appreciated. Thanks.
[16:56:58] <TelFiRE> Is calling animate() with a transition time of 0ms any different performance-wise from calling css() ?
[16:57:02] <MindSpark> coldhead: now it's loading, but still the same error
[16:58:09] <coldhead> coachz: yes. or check out masonry maybe
[16:58:20] <coachz> what is masonry ?
[16:58:49] <coldhead> TelFiRE: yes, it executes different codepaths even if it looks the same. also somethings that work with css() won't work with animate()
[16:58:57] <tw2113> coachz, http://masonry.desandro.com/
[16:58:58] <coldhead> coachz: google it, it's a layout plugin
[16:59:04] <coachz> thanks gentlemen !!
[16:59:10] <coachz> jQuery for the win !
[16:59:10] <TelFiRE> coldhead: understandable, but is it a performance conern?
[16:59:13] <TelFiRE> concern*
[16:59:25] <coldhead> i would never be concerned with it
[16:59:38] <coldhead> but your mileage may vary!
[16:59:43] <TelFiRE> Basically I've got elements that should animate if mobile mode is false, so I was thinking of just setting my animation timings to a variable that I set to 0 if in mobile mode
[17:00:51] <coldhead> MindSpark: you are including a version of jQuery UI which was built without tabs()
[17:00:59] <coldhead> damn custom builds! >: |
[17:01:23] <coldhead> ?$.fx.off
[17:01:24] <bot-t> coldhead, jQuery.fx.off - Globally disable all animations. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.fx.off/
[17:01:31] <coldhead> TelFiRE: ^
[17:01:47] <MindSpark> coldhead:  :( that's the CMS. Is there a way I can add it as a plugin?
[17:02:24] <coldhead> MindSpark: just hotlink from microsoft http://www.asp.net/ajaxlibrary/cdn.ashx#jQuery_UI_Releases_on_the_CDN_1
[17:02:33] <coldhead> get a full version and it should work
[17:02:52] <coachz> Any idea if Masonry supports drag and drop ?
[17:03:29] <coldhead> i don't think it does but i don't think it would be impossible to add
[17:03:49] <coachz> thanks coldhead
[17:04:12] <MindSpark> I guess I'll just find a random plugin, don't want to mess with the cms code
[17:04:28] <coldhead> ?nopm @ Guest51994
[17:04:29] <bot-t> Guest51994, Please keep all questions and code in the channel so everyone has a chance to help and benefit. Only privately message someone if he/she specifically requests it, e.g. for cyber.
[17:05:02] <coldhead> MindSpark: there is an old version of jQuery tabs before it got absorbed into UI
[17:05:07] <coldhead> you could try that one
[17:05:17] <Guest51994> can someone help  me with http://jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#custom-data
[17:05:18] <motox> If I have a div that is a fixed width, and it is dynamically populated with data from ajax (1 line of text for name), is it possible to scale the font size so it will downsize to fit on one line instead of wrapping to the next line?
[17:05:32] <MindSpark> coldhead: yea, that's what I am going to do, thanks!
[17:05:41] <coldhead> i don't know much about autocomplete/#custom-data , Guest51994
[17:05:49] <coldhead> do you have some code we can look at?
[17:05:59] <coldhead> instead of just a link to the documentation we already helped write?
[17:06:13] <coldhead> motox: not easily
[17:06:51] <Guest51994> coldhead yeah but i changed most of it does it matter if i changed it
[17:06:54] <coldhead> you (generally) have to mess with the font-size in a div off screen (margin-left:-99999em} and see what size font you need to have the width "jump" to a single height
[17:06:54] <madprops> how can i check if  string is of the format 'word on word' where word cane be any word?
[17:07:28] <coldhead> ?eval 'word on word'.match(/\w+ on \w+/)
[17:07:32] <bot-t> coldhead: ["word on word"]
[17:07:40] <coldhead> ?eval 'word non word'.match(/\w+ on \w+/)
[17:07:41] <bot-t> coldhead: null
[17:07:53] <coldhead> Guest51994: we'll see what we can do
[17:09:07] <motox> coldhead>  OK, damn.  I was thinking I could set the white-space to nowrap, then grab the width of the scrollable content, the scale it accordingly
[17:09:23] <motox> it might work, but thats kind of messy
[17:09:24] <coldhead> that is probably harder
[17:09:53] <coldhead> but similar gross idea
[17:10:30] <madprops> thanks coldhead
[17:10:35] <motox> ok
[17:11:11] <motox> 90% of the time I can get away with a nice bold font that is easy to read.  But sometimes it wraps on long names and messes the display all up.  Not sure what the best solution is
[17:12:18] <coldhead> don't let people have dynamic text
[17:12:27] <coldhead> just always use the same text with a known length
[17:13:13] <motox> coldhead> Its loading live event data to populate real time results for races.  Its people's names
[17:13:37] <coldhead> give them all the same name
[17:13:41] <coldhead> Mr American
[17:13:44] <coldhead> or Mrs American
[17:13:50] <motox> lol
[17:13:57] <motox> Person ID#2
[17:14:06] <hugo_moss> how can i prefetch font-face files?
[17:14:11] <coldhead> the best solution really is text-overflow: ellipsis
[17:14:18] <motox> I could just show their ID numbers and let users cross reference it to a entry list :)
[17:14:20] <coldhead> and title="full text here"
[17:15:25] <motox> coldhead: Yeah, I was thinking of that possibility
[17:15:48] <coldhead> if you can swing it with the clients that's a winner
[17:16:14] <hugo_moss> anyone able to recommend some jquery books from their collection?
[17:17:33] <coldhead> hugo_moss: http://jqfundamentals.com/
[17:23:26] <slick-> any idea why I keep getting a 'flashmovie' is a null or does not exist error in i.e. 10...
[17:24:00] <b0x> flash not installed?
[17:24:59] <slick-> wow
[17:25:06] <slick-> you just saved me like 10  hours of debugging
[17:25:08] <slick-> thank you kind sir
[17:25:54] <b0x> lol
[17:26:06] <b0x> np
[17:27:27] <hugo_moss> any in depth books coldhead?
[17:27:40] <hugo_moss> anybody here read jquery: from novice to ninja
[17:27:48] <hugo_moss> anyone recommend that book?
[17:30:35] <coldhead> i read that hugo_moss
[17:30:37] <coldhead> it's good
[17:30:44] <coldhead> old version of jquery though
[17:30:51] <coldhead> but the basics still hold
[17:31:17] <coldhead> there aren't many really deep books on jQuery because it's not that deep a tool
[17:31:26] <coldhead> the deep stuff is in pure JS
[17:31:33] <coldhead> eloquent JS, JS the good parts
[17:31:43] <coldhead> et hoc genus omne
[17:37:11] <motox> coldhead>  What are your thoughts on this?  Too messy?    http://jsfiddle.net/qHbtV/
[17:37:52] <hugo_moss> coldhead, is there any books that like go through the things you actually want to do jquery, like coming across wanting to prefetch images and font-face files, things you actually want to do to develop a good site
[17:38:35] <hugo_moss> i mean everything i look for answers for i find on stackoverflow.com
[17:38:58] <motox> hugo_moss>  This is good if you are getting started with jquery:  http://jqfundamentals.com/
[17:39:17] <coldhead> that's real nice motox
[17:40:42] <coldhead> hugo_moss: probably the best way to get a feel for different techniques is to choose a framework like backbone.js and see what they're doing in terms of techniques
[17:40:53] <coldhead> then try a different framework and see if you learn anything new
[17:41:00] <motox> coldhead> Thanks for the ideas :)
[17:41:03] <coldhead> most of the state of the art is moving too quickly for books
[17:41:28] <hugo_moss> ok
[17:41:48] <hugo_moss> so like if i wanted to find out how i can prefetch font-face files, where would you look for that besides google?
[17:42:01] <hugo_moss> i have javascript the definitive guide and it goes over preloading images
[17:42:05] <hugo_moss> but nothing else
[17:42:07] <coldhead> in that as in so many other matters i would be looking at the blog of one Mr Paul Irish
[17:42:15] <hugo_moss> yea
[17:42:20] <hugo_moss> he has a solution for it
[17:42:31] <coldhead> i'd do whatever he says
[17:42:34] <hugo_moss> ok
[17:42:53] <coldhead> Drink the Kool-Aid Mr Irish? Why certainly, Mr Irish!
[17:43:00] <hugo_moss> hehehe
[17:43:14] <hugo_moss> how long you been using jquery coldhead?
[17:43:36] <coldhead> spiritually speaking, it's my first day
[17:43:45] <coldhead> but historically it's been 5 years i guess
[17:44:20] <hugo_moss> how long were you using javascript before jquery
[17:44:29] <coldhead> 0 days
[17:44:34] <hugo_moss> cool
[17:44:36] <coldhead> i hated js until jquery made it easier
[17:44:41] <hugo_moss> yea
[17:44:53] <coldhead> i only bothered with js once jQuery made it stop hurting
[17:44:54] <hugo_moss> you program in other languages?
[17:45:00] <coldhead> yes i do
[17:45:03] <hugo_moss> which
[17:45:20] <coldhead> ruby, php, perl, lisp, python, c
[17:45:27] <hugo_moss> i find javascript and jquery more fun than c++
[17:45:33] <hugo_moss> and java
[17:45:34] <coldhead> me too
[17:45:45] <coldhead> c++ is just a necessary evil now
[17:46:05] <hugo_moss> yea
[17:46:51] <hugo_moss> you design too?
[17:47:28] <hugo_moss> graphic design
[17:48:46] <coldhead> god no, hugo_moss
[17:48:51] <coldhead> i can't design to save my life
[17:49:31] <hugo_moss> everything just takes practice i guess
[17:49:40] <coldhead> practice and interest
[17:49:40] <hugo_moss> depending on what you spend most of your time with
[17:49:45] <hugo_moss> true that
[17:49:54] <hugo_moss> definitely interest
[17:50:01] <Newyorkish> thats true
[17:50:07] <Newyorkish> sorry to jump in
[17:50:26] <Newyorkish> i design and code, it just takes dedication
[17:50:58] <Newyorkish> copying other people's shit until you develop your own style, just like coding i an way
[17:51:00] <hugo_moss> do what you love
[17:52:04] <madprops> is there some kind of startswith for strings in jquery?
[17:52:46] <coldhead> ?eval 'aids'.charAt(0)
[17:52:47] <bot-t> coldhead: "a"
[17:52:50] <coldhead> like that madprops ?
[17:53:06] <Newyorkish> http://api.jquery.com/attribute-starts-with-selector/ ?
[17:53:34] <sgharms> If I'm subclassing a jQuery UI widget, is there a way to access the parent's event handlers that were defined in the _on({}) call?
[17:56:09] <madprops> coldhead, nvm i forgot substring existed
[17:56:37] <coldhead> string manipulation in JS is the worst thing in the whole world
[17:57:45] <bubu> its probably better than C
[17:58:47] <hugo_moss> www.google.com
[17:59:39] <coldhead> at least C gives you access to the actual implementation
[17:59:46] <coldhead> so you can do pointer arithmetic
[17:59:49] <coldhead> if that's your thing
[18:00:05] <bubu> its not pretty
[18:00:14] <coldhead> JS is like "here's how to do a few things awkwardly, and very half-assed regular expressions. good luck!
[18:00:53] <oojacoboo> lol
[18:20:55] <madprops> there should be a split method like pythons
[18:31:49] <syntax> http://jsfiddle.net/g9E46/1/ what i am doing wrong?
[18:32:52] <shoky> syntax: various things
[18:33:08] <shoky> syntax: there's no element with class 'article-61'
[18:33:21] <shoky> syntax: you can't do .attr('href').click ..
[18:34:05] <syntax> how can i trigger this href
[18:34:34] <shoky> huh?
[18:35:05] <syntax> i aint want to fire the href itself
[18:35:54] <syntax> it should work like this: http://jsfiddle.net/fqR7H/
[18:36:21] <syntax> but without the class-name in the a tag
[18:37:30] <shoky> but without that class you're referencing a non-existent element..?
[18:37:54] <shoky> maybe you want this i donno.. http://jsfiddle.net/g9E46/3/
[18:38:17] <syntax> can i use next child?
[18:38:39] <shoky> ask a full question, you're impossible to understand
[18:39:16] <shoky> ?next
[18:39:17] <bot-t> .next([selector]): Get the immediately following sibling of each element in the set of matched elements. If a selector is provided, it retrieves the next sibling only if it matches that selector. http://api.jquery.com/next/
[18:41:57] <max1> hello, question about qunit.........trying to test 1 module with ?module=test_module, but it just runs all the modules. any suggestions on how i can fix this?

[18:43:20] <shoky> syntax: i gave you a link- http://jsfiddle.net/g9E46/3/
[18:43:20] <syntax> it works..
[18:43:44] <syntax> ye this too

[18:50:06] <madprops> i stand corrected
[18:53:07] <kam187-rMBP> hmm is it possible to insert into the middle of a list view?
[18:53:17] <kam187-rMBP> i only see append (and prepend)

[18:54:55] <kam187-rMBP> ooh awesome :)
[19:14:33] <Belrick> Hi was wondering if someone could answer a question for me?
[19:15:45] <Newyorkish> what do you need
[19:15:54] <Belrick> Cheers
[19:16:31] <Belrick> $('#main_container_fill').children().fadeOut('fast', function() { .. } works well for me but it calls this function once for each child element. How can i alter my code to call the function within it just once?
[19:17:12] <shoky> Belrick: $('#main_container_fill').children().fadeOut('fast').promise().done(function() { .. });    will do it, i think
[19:17:21] <Belrick> :O
[19:17:26] <Belrick> wow thankyou!
[19:17:29] <Belrick> testing...
[19:18:10] <Newyorkish> good one
[19:18:45] <Belrick> yes that worked a treat thankyou very much!
[19:21:28] <gcpeters> anyone know how to trigger draggable? I am using it on ipad and I want dragging to start on taphold
[19:24:21] <Belrick> im no expert gcpeters but on page finishing loading you just assign .draggable to an element
[19:25:30] <gcpeters> and then call draggable('start'), I'll give that a try, thanks
[19:26:12] <Belrick> not sure about this start business lol
[19:26:54] <Belrick> i use draggable heavily for a web based game i made where users can drag and drop items into character slots. jquery really made it work well however there were pitfalls across the browsers
[19:31:01] <gcpeters> yea, I bet, (start didn't work, I thought it was an option) I am able to map the touch events, but you have to tap and move, I want the dragged item to sho up on just tap and hold
[19:31:34] <gcpeters> maybe if I can trigger mousemove or something
[19:35:57] <Belrick> not sure what you mean.  $('.makeMeDraggable').draggable({        ...(options in here)...} ); will cause the onmousedown element to move with the mouse till mouse button is released which can then call an assigned droppable event/function
[19:37:51] <gcpeters> yeah, we have dragable working on desktops, but jquery ui draggable doesn't seem to work with touch events out of the box, but I found a plugin called touchpunch that maps touch events to the mouse events for most jquery UI widgets
[19:37:59] <chare> you can get a small free instance from heroku, are there similar things from amazon, google, rackspace, linode, etc.?
[19:38:32] <gcpeters> but on an ipad, you have to tap then move your finger for dragging to start
[19:39:02] <gcpeters> we're using a dragHelper, so it's a diferent element, I would like that element to appear on tap and hold, right now it only appears on tap and move
[19:39:03] <Belrick> ahh good to know! was planning on porting my web app to ipads etc. seems to be where the market is heading
[19:39:43] <Belrick> so youre saying helper: 'clone', only triggers when the mouse is moved initially?
[19:39:53] <gcpeters> yeah
[19:40:08] <Belrick> all i can say sorry is bugger.
[19:41:14] <barryhjames> I'm a little lost.  http://jsfiddle.net/yHx9e/  When someone clicks the link, it should create another set of form fields to add a phone number to.  Any ideas?
[19:41:14] <gcpeters> yea, the designer wants it, may not be able to deliver it, I may try using native drag/drop and see if I can do it with that
[19:45:09] <shoky> barryhjames: http://jsfiddle.net/yHx9e/7/
[19:46:47] <barryhjames> shoky: Awesome!  Thanks so much!
[19:49:33] <kam187-rMBP> hm how do i iterate every element with id '#le'
[19:49:42] <kam187-rMBP> $("#le").each( just seems to find the first one
[19:51:12] <shoky> kam187-rMBP: id's should be unique
[19:51:19] <shoky> kam187-rMBP: use a class instead
[19:51:19] <kam187-rMBP> ah
[19:51:23] <kam187-rMBP> ok
[20:23:56] <coldhead> ghosty head, oh ghosty head
[21:21:58] <garbagecollectio> how do i access nested object literals from outside the parent object literal?
[21:22:41] <coldhead> foo.bar.aids ?
[21:27:15] <awc737> how do I pass data from .done(function(data) {... to it's callback?
[21:27:34] <awc737> http://paste.laravel.com/alH
[21:27:40] <awc737> you will see on line 4 where I try to alert(data)
[21:27:42] <Cork> its callback you mean in $.ajax({}) ?
[21:27:53] <awc737> yeah
[21:28:24] <Cork> ah, no you mean resolveWith?
[21:28:27] <Cork> ?.resolveWith
[21:28:29] <bot-t> deferred.resolveWith(context, [args]): Resolve a Deferred object and call any doneCallbacks with the given context and args. http://api.jquery.com/deferred.resolveWith/
[21:28:56] <awc737> actually resolve(data) seemed to do it
[21:29:18] <awc737> response.resolve(data);... and in the call: getAllOrders().done(function(data) {
[21:29:34] <coldhead> great job everyone, let's take five
[21:30:02] <awc737> ok i'm going to grab a snack then
[21:30:31] <awc737> what is resolveWith even for if resolve(data) works
[21:31:03] <EoN> how do i select (and remove) this item? <li data-list-item-id="22">
[21:31:27] <Cork> $('li[data-list-item-id="22"]').remove()
[21:31:46] <Cork> prefereably $parent.find('li[data-list-item-id="22"]').remove();
[21:31:49] <Cork> if you can do that
[21:32:04] <EoN> thanks Cork.  so if the variable was dynamic at the time of selection, could i do: $('li[data-list-item-id="'.data.id.'"]').remove(); ?
[21:32:15] <Cork> yes
[21:32:19] <EoN> awesome. tyvm
[21:32:25] <Cork> but see the comment above
[21:32:33] <EoN> got ya.  yeah i will defo use the parent
[21:32:52] <Cork> that selector is quite slow, so you want to limit its search range as much as possible (with a fast selector)
[21:33:15] <EoN> makes sense
[21:35:29] <mouses> if i'm creating a contact page for a personal site and i use social network icons 50x50px, for facebook and youtube and twitter etc, is it best practice to use <img src="foo"> or CSS (background-url) ?
[21:36:56] <coldhead> mouses: http://css-tricks.com/css-image-replacement/
[21:37:02] <coldhead> those are "best" practice
[21:38:13] <mouses> thanks
[21:39:39] <EoN> hmm this is weird. im using jquerymobile, and in the return function of $.post, it doenst seem to be able to recognise attributes via $('#myul')
[21:47:52] <awc737> I have a json multidim array where each item has a value for it's id key
[21:48:52] <awc737> like {"632542":{"foo":"bar", etc...
[21:49:03] <awc737> how can I get that first value? otherwise i can do item.foo
[21:49:04] <oojacoboo> and
[21:49:09] <awc737> but I just want to get item's value
[21:49:32] <awc737> item just prints [object Object]
[21:49:33] <dblosevn> bad juju to make json keys all numeric
[21:50:25] <awc737> why?
[21:50:32] <awc737> thats the unique key
[21:50:44] <oojacoboo> awc737: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4652663/get-key-name-from-json-object
[21:50:45] <awc737> that is like the orderNumber
[21:50:48] <oojacoboo> did you google?
[21:50:54] <dblosevn> because a variable cannot start with a number
[21:51:14] <awc737> it's not really a variable
[21:51:19] <awc737> a variable VALUE can start with a number
[21:51:20] <oojacoboo> I would certainly revise the object though
[21:51:33] <awc737> how else should I best identify it's uniqueness?
[21:51:35] <oojacoboo> it's not a number anyway it's a string
[21:51:37] <dblosevn> {id: 632542, item: {foo: 'bar'
[21:51:37] <awc737> it's like user id
[21:51:44] <awc737> oh
[21:51:44] <oojacoboo> or an int rather
[21:52:04] <dblosevn> thats not a value
[21:52:07] <dblosevn> thats a key
[21:52:13] <oojacoboo> ?
[21:52:14] <awc737> oh really
[21:52:19] <dblosevn> yes
[21:52:29] <dblosevn> obj.12345 will not work
[21:52:32] <awc737> this was working...
[21:52:32] <awc737> 	jQuery.each(jQuery.parseJSON(orders), function(i) {
[21:52:32] <awc737> 		alert(i);
[21:52:37] <awc737> it was alerting those values
[21:52:49] <awc737> and then I could do order.name, etc
[21:52:57] <dblosevn> yes it will parse the object no it is not good practice and no you wont be able to access the member
[21:53:00] <oojacoboo> prob b/c it's a string
[21:53:02] <oojacoboo> not an int
[21:53:17] <dblosevn> unless you each the object
[21:53:28] <awc737> ok then if I do it like this {id: 632542, item: {foo: 'bar'
[21:53:35] <awc737> how can I say grab object where ID =
[21:53:37] <awc737> that number
[21:53:39] <dblosevn> that would be best practive
[21:53:42] <dblosevn> obj.id
[21:53:53] <awc737> your forgetting the where
[21:53:54] <dblosevn> obj.item.foo
[21:54:26] <dblosevn> if (obj.id == 632542)
[21:54:34] <awc737> yeah but without doing a loop
[21:54:43] <awc737> because before I could just do obj[123].name
[21:55:07] <dblosevn> {} is not an array
[21:55:19] <dblosevn> its an object extremely surpised that worked at all
[21:55:37] <awc737> i want it to be an  object its json
[21:55:43] <awc737> i thought json was all objects
[21:55:55] <dblosevn> everything in js is an object
[21:56:02] <dblosevn> an array is just an array object
[21:56:32] <dblosevn> but obj[index].key is how you would access a member of an array
[21:57:41] <awc737> ok well I'm just going to take your word it's better practice
[21:57:47] <relipse>  hey, i created a website for tracking time and billing clients, would anyone mind trying it out for me?
[21:57:52] <awc737> so I need to modify my php building array
[21:58:00] <awc737> $orders["$orderNumber"] = array(	'status' => (string)$status,
[21:59:17] <awc737> dblosevn, it should look like this now?
[21:59:23] <awc737> $orders["id"] => $orderNumber, 'items' => array('status' => (string)$status,
[21:59:56] <awc737> that just breaks :(
[22:00:13] <dblosevn> your still doing the same thing
[22:00:18] <dblosevn> that works in php
[22:00:34] <dblosevn> as $orders is an array of arrays
[22:00:45] <awc737> i need to make it properly in PHP though
[22:00:54] <awc737> or I need to make it how your saying, not sure how
[22:01:02] <dblosevn> no you need to make it output a valid json object
[22:01:10] <awc737> http://paste.laravel.com/alO
[22:01:48] <awc737> dblosevn, yes your right
[22:01:49] <awc737> http://paste.laravel.com/alP
[22:01:58] <awc737> you can fork that... I need to make it ourput a valid json object
[22:02:24] <dblosevn> awc737: http://paste.laravel.com/alQ
[22:03:13] <dblosevn> will output a josn array of objects
[22:03:19] <dblosevn> *json
[22:03:37] <awc737> hmm
[22:04:09] <grafi> or a blank page ^^
[22:04:37] <awc737> should it be starting with [{"orderNumber":"632542",
[22:04:38] <dblosevn> will look something like [{"id": 232323, "status": 'pending'...}]
[22:04:39] <awc737> [
[22:05:11] <dblosevn> im lost on what you mean by where
[22:05:15] <awc737> ok but then how do I alert status of object with id 232323, without looping
[22:06:02] <dblosevn> on your ajax response you would loop the array and inject your elements into the dom
[22:06:17] <awc737> yeah but I'm curious
[22:06:20] <dblosevn> at that point you an query the dom for whatever you want
[22:09:22] <awc737> this no longer works then
[22:09:30] <awc737> jQuery.each(jQuery.parseJSON(orders), function() { alert(orders.orderNumber)
[22:15:16] <dblosevn> http://paste.laravel.com/amd
[22:15:34] <dblosevn> awc737:
[22:16:04] <awc737> dblosevn, doesn't jquery have some nifty each functions specifically for json?
[22:16:29] <dblosevn> ya but why go through the overhead of each when you have an array
[22:17:12] <dblosevn> sorry typo http://paste.laravel.com/ame
[22:17:31] <tcberner> Good morning. I have a $.ajax request that works in opera, firefox and chrome. But it only works in IE9 if I put it into IE9/Quirks via Developer Tools -- how is this possible? I see now warnnings in the ie9 console
[22:18:00] <dblosevn> probally an orphaned , somewhere
[22:18:17] <dblosevn> most real browsers just ignore them
[22:18:27] <Cork> is that allowed in quirks mode??
[22:18:30] <dblosevn> ie however does not
[22:18:48] <Cork> don't think ie ever allows trailing commas
[22:18:50] <dblosevn> until ie9 that is
[22:18:59] <dblosevn> ya ie9 it started working
[22:19:13] <Cork> then read the question again
[22:19:39] <Cork> tcberner: can you reproduce it in jsfiddle?
[22:20:15] <dblosevn> i have a script that is still broken in ie<9 i cant find the , to save my life
[22:20:17] <dblosevn> lol
[22:20:47] <dblosevn> nobody that uses it use ie though so it hasnt been at the top of my list
[22:22:23] <dblosevn> theres like 30k lines of js and it doesnt error anywhere near it
[22:24:21] <Cork> dblosevn: run it through jslent
[22:24:39] <dblosevn> possibly
[22:25:15] <Cork> sorry jshint
[22:25:23] <Cork> never remember the name of that site -_-'
[22:27:27] <dblosevn> Cork: too many errors stopped @ 0%
[22:28:01] <Cork> dblosevn: you can disable checks in jshint
[22:28:04] <dblosevn> stupid shit too not even real errors mainly because ext and jquery are not there
[22:28:11] <Cork> thats why its interesting
[22:28:15] <Cork> ?g jshint
[22:28:18] <bot-t> Cork, JSHint, A JavaScript Code Quality Tool - http://www.jshint.com/
[22:28:33] <Cork> (compared to jslint)
[22:28:34] <dblosevn> ill check it out i was using lint on my local box
[22:31:01] <dblosevn> Too many errors. (34% scanned).
[22:31:10] <dblosevn> and i turned everything off
[22:31:14] <dblosevn> pretty much
[22:32:24] <tcberner> Cork: Found the error. Was not direclty jquery related. I noticed, that the json of the ajax-request reaches the app "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Search?go=Go&search=\"name\",\"=\",\"T\"" -- but IE had '\" = \"' note the spaces
[22:33:29] <Cork> heh
[22:33:31] <tcberner> so as a fix, I can just do a more clever compare than my predecessors
[22:33:43] <tcberner> but still weird, that IE returns spaces around this one value
[22:34:05] <Cork> ie is weird in most cases when it comes to codeing for it
[22:34:25] <tcberner> yeah -- I fought vor 3 days with it :P
[22:34:27] <dblosevn> i agree, i give up again
[22:34:27] <Cork> why do you think developers have to spend to much times getting it to work in it?
[22:34:52] <dblosevn> i turned everything off and jslint still errors out at 34%
[22:34:53] <Cork> i normally say 20% developing a site for all browsers
[22:35:03] <Cork> 80%  getting it to work as it should in ie browsers :/
[22:35:13] <tcberner> i use jqPlot and jqDatepicker and this filter with had problems
[22:35:25] <tcberner> 2 of them work in ie9 standard, well now hopefully all 3 ^^
[22:35:27] <Cork> luckely the place i work at now days mostly just says "screw ie" :)
[22:35:40] <tcberner> here everyone uses IE0
[22:35:43] <tcberner> IE9
[22:36:09] <tcberner> so it's kind of important that it works there :P
[22:36:13] <Cork> ya ie<9 is getting quite a small problem
[22:36:31] <tcberner> yea, at least I know that only IE9 ist around
[22:36:37] <dblosevn> imma try minying it
[22:36:46] <dblosevn> then beautifying it
[22:37:25] <dblosevn> or it will just lock up the program lmao
[22:39:08] <Cork> dblosevn: btw you're sure trailing commas is accepted in ie9?
[22:39:15] <Cork> i was quite sure it wasn't
[22:39:51] <tcberner> afaik my jqPlots didn't work because I had one
[22:40:00] <Cork> LOL
[22:40:01] <Cork> dblosevn: http://trailingcomma.com/
[22:40:02] <Cork> :D
[22:40:08] <Cork> just what you need ^^
[22:40:20] <dblosevn> this app works in ie9, dont work in less then 9 and it used to
[22:40:45] <dblosevn> Danger, Will Robinson!Commas found! Check below.
[22:43:21] <Cork> heh interesting
[22:43:33] <Cork> dblosevn: just test and ya, clearly ie9 handles it
[22:43:38] <Cork> very, VERY nice!
[22:43:57] <dblosevn> Yeay
[22:44:06] <dblosevn> *yay or something even
[22:44:08] <Cork> *in ie
[22:44:25] <dblosevn> only screwed up once
[22:44:42] <dblosevn> extensions: this.extensions.getValue(),\n}
[22:45:01] <Cork> search and you shall find :)
[22:45:16] <dblosevn> already commited to the repo and deployed
[22:45:57] <dblosevn> that site is definitely going in my toolbelt
[22:46:17] <dblosevn> i get thoughs all the time when working with ext
[22:46:51] <dblosevn> usually a bitch to nail down where there at being the whole ui is built with json
[22:47:05] <Cork> ya
[22:47:33] <Cork> what drives me nuts is there java hierarchy structure
[22:47:39] <Cork> so DAMN hard to extend it
[22:47:49] <dblosevn> and boy jslint sure doesnt like that shit
[22:48:00] <Cork> just doing the simplest things that goes outside there model the slightest breaks everything
[22:48:17] <dblosevn> ya usually theres always a way to stay in the model though
[22:48:24] <Cork> well not breaks but takes ages to do
[22:48:47] <dblosevn> and i use sencha archtect so it already extends all the base classes for you
[22:48:57] <Cork> dblosevn: i meant handing data from one type of object to another object they haven't though anyone wanting to do
[22:49:07] <Cork> styling the grid in a way they didn't think of
[22:49:08] <Cork> and so on
[22:49:11] <dblosevn> there new ide is bad ass
[22:49:27] <dblosevn> use meta on the renderers
[22:49:32] <Cork> ya, as long as you don't have to touch the code ;P
[22:49:36] <dblosevn> like 3 lines of code
[22:49:41] <Cork> the designer is nice
[22:50:05] <dblosevn> ya its a bitch to not touch the code though
[22:50:22] <dblosevn> usually before im done with a project i cant use the designer anymore
[22:50:34] <Cork> i would have loved to have that ui designer for jquery through :D
[22:50:43] <Cork> that would have been sweet
[22:50:57] <dblosevn> they are damn sure proud of it, its like 300bux lmao
[22:51:08] <Cork> (give the designer the ui designer, and you just have to connect it together :D )
[22:51:10] <dblosevn> made one of my clients buy it for me :-D
[22:51:44] <dblosevn> the new one support sencha touch
[22:51:51] <Cork> ya, i know
[22:52:06] <dblosevn> i prefer jqm over touch though
[22:52:10] <Cork> i find sencha touch utterly useless though
[22:52:20] <Cork> i find jqm quite useless too though
[22:52:23] <dblosevn> ^^
[22:52:37] <dblosevn> its nice for quick mobile projects
[22:52:39] <Cork> its so simple to make the same thing with pure jquery
[22:52:47] <dblosevn> nothing that needs any real ui though
[22:52:51] <Cork> so why go the long way around :)
[22:53:13] <dblosevn> i did a couple phonegap/jqm apps
[22:53:49] <dblosevn> real simple ui, threw the apps together in less then a day
[22:54:11] <dblosevn> i think phonegap will be the wave of the future after it gains a little more popularity
[22:54:29] <oojacoboo> dblosevn: wanna do me an app?
[22:54:38] <dblosevn> use what we already know... js,html5,css to built crossplatform cross device apps
[22:54:47] <dblosevn> *build
[22:54:59] <dblosevn> oojacoboo: how deep are your pockets
[22:55:08] <oojacoboo> unfortunately not very :(
[22:55:18] <Cork> dblosevn: from what i've heard of it, it can be really slow quite fast
[22:55:36] <dblosevn> dont overcomplicate your apps and its fine
[22:55:43] <awc737> how can I check the number of objects in JSON?
[22:55:47] <dblosevn> definitely some room for imrpovement
[22:55:54] <awc737> i'm trying to do if data.legnth > 0
[22:55:55] <dblosevn> but ios accepted it finally
[22:56:02] <dblosevn> so its definitely getting better
[22:56:04] <awc737> but even if my json is an empty array, the count is > 0
[22:56:15] <oojacoboo> awc737: length
[22:56:19] <Cork> awc737: json doens't explay if that's possible
[22:56:36] <Cork> awc737: cause json is just a format, not a type
[22:56:38] <awc737> doesn't explay?
[22:56:40] <dblosevn> awc737: use the code i showed you
[22:56:51] <awc737> no because length still spits something
[22:56:55] <Cork> awc737: if your outer element is an array .length works, if its an object it doens't
[22:56:55] <awc737> like 'Array', so it's 5
[22:56:58] <dblosevn> that for loop wont loop anything if its an empty array
[22:57:13] <dblosevn> and the response i showed you
[22:57:51] <Cork> awc737: ah, you mean you have the unparsed json string?
[22:58:00] <awc737> i'm trying to do it here: }).done(function( data ) {	if ( data.length > 0 ) {
[22:58:01] <Cork> like '[]' `
[22:58:04] <Cork> *?
[22:58:06] <awc737> yupj
[22:58:07] <dblosevn> oojacoboo: what you lookin for
[22:58:12] <awc737> it is right no [], so =
[22:58:12] <awc737> 2
[22:58:15] <Cork> awc737: you get it through ajax?
[22:58:19] <awc737> right now* []
[22:58:21] <awc737> php
[22:58:25] <awc737> oops yeah ajax
[22:58:27] <oojacoboo> dblosevn: we need an app for our SaaS co
[22:58:37] <dblosevn> i shoued him an example that already gave him the json parsed
[22:58:45] <Cork> awc737: set the content-type to application/json
[22:58:50] <Cork> awc737: and it should work just ine
[22:58:52] <Cork> *fine
[22:58:58] <dblosevn> showed even wow
[22:59:21] <awc737> ?
[22:59:47] <Cork> do <?php header('content-type', 'application/json'); ?>
[22:59:56] <Cork> before you send your json back
[23:00:05] <awc737> header('Content-Type: application/json'); yeah that worked
[23:00:18] <awc737> i meant what is showed even wow
[23:00:22] <Cork> jquery listens for that and converts the string to an object
[23:00:51] <dblosevn>  i shoued him ... showed even wow
[23:01:02] <awc737> dblosevn, yes you did... I'm using that
[23:01:11] <awc737> but now I'm emptying the array to pretend the webservice returned nothing
[23:01:13] <dblosevn> my keyboard is being uncoroperative
[23:02:41] <awc737> hm actually this header is being wierd
[23:02:44] <awc737> now the data is not returning
[23:02:50] <Cork> O_o
[23:03:05] <Cork> awc737: are you using json_encode?
[23:03:17] <awc737> yes
[23:03:29] <Cork> and data is empty??
[23:03:32] <awc737> wait it is returning just seems to behave different
[23:03:52] <Cork> yes, its a javascript parsed object now
[23:03:59] <Cork> not a string
[23:04:36] <awc737> hm nvm
[23:04:44] <awc737> seems I just no longer needed jQuery.parseJSON(orders)
[23:04:50] <Cork> yup
[23:04:56] <Cork> its already parsed
[23:05:30] <awc737> although data.length doesnt really work
[23:05:48] <Cork> awc737: could you generate a structure string for the json?
[23:05:52] <Cork> (without the real data)
[23:06:02] <awc737> what do you mean
[23:06:23] <VectorX> is there a function to alert an object as a string ?
[23:06:24] <Cork> the json you return, but with the sensitive values removed
[23:06:39] <Cork> VectorX: console.log ;)
[23:06:46] <awc737> sensitive values?
[23:06:49] <awc737> you want me to show you
[23:07:05] <Cork> yes, its easier to tell if data.length would work
[23:07:08] <awc737> http://pastie.org/5349786
[23:07:39] <VectorX> Cork ty
[23:07:39] <Cork> ok that won't work with .length
[23:07:44] <Cork> you have an object, not an array
[23:08:04] <Cork> (an array can't specify the position in the array)
[23:08:18] <awc737> :(
[23:08:20] <Cork> you have to options restructure your data
[23:08:29] <Cork> or you would have to loop the object and count the keys
[23:08:29] <awc737> i think I want to go back to not using header then... ?
[23:08:31] <awc737> confused
[23:08:49] <awc737> restructure my data? and keep the JSON header?
[23:09:00] <Cork> var keys = 0; data.each(function() { keys++; });
[23:09:39] <Cork> awc737: [ {"id":"632542", "poNumber":"19543189"...},{}]
[23:09:52] <awc737> Cork, that's how it was before I put header...
[23:10:00] <Cork> instead of {"632542":{}}
[23:10:10] <Cork> awc737: no
[23:10:14] <awc737> oh
[23:10:18] <Cork> that data can't match an array
[23:10:57] <Cork> you can't specify the position for the value in an array
[23:11:00] <VectorX> http://jsfiddle.net/D63Ex/ with this example, it doesnt work or give an error with { name: "John", time: "2pm" }   but if i remove it the script works, why is that ?
[23:11:06] <Cork> arrays is always synchronous
[23:11:18] <Cork> (with the first value at 0)
[23:11:28] <awc737> ok it's working perfect now
[23:12:09] <awc737> thank you Cork and dblosevn
[23:12:35] <Cork> VectorX: you prob have the same as awc737 just had :)
[23:12:48] <Cork> VectorX: your server doens't send json content-type
[23:13:11] <Eshu_> HI Guys
[23:13:17] <Cork> VectorX: ah, no wayt
[23:13:20] <Cork> *wait
[23:13:27] <VectorX> Cork its working with json, just stops with i add the data part for the function
[23:13:32] <Cork> VectorX: what is the error you get?
[23:13:40] <VectorX> there is no error
[23:13:46] <Cork> VectorX: ya i missed what you meant with the object :)
[23:14:04] <VectorX> let me try adding an error to .post and see if anything shows up
[23:14:09] <Cork> VectorX: your sure the server responds with those params?
[23:14:51] <VectorX> well they are just params, the script doesnt requier any, im testing
[23:15:03] <VectorX> from the help page
[23:15:32] <Trisox> morning all
[23:17:12] <VectorX> Cork hmm looks like there is an error in .error, whats the var to see it ?
[23:17:59] <Cork> responseText if i remember correctly
[23:18:12] <Trisox> mornig Cork
[23:18:17] <Cork> o/
[23:18:27] <Trisox> \o/
[23:18:32] <Trisox> o//
[23:18:49] <Cork> VectorX: error(jqXHR, textStatus, errorThrown)
[23:22:57] <VectorX> Cork is this wrong http://jsfiddle.net/D63Ex/3/
[23:23:19] <Cork> yes
[23:23:25] <VectorX> sweet
[23:25:07] <Cork> ?
[23:25:19] <Cork> how is it sweet that what you wrote is wrong? :D

[23:25:55] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/D63Ex/4/
[23:26:26] <Cork> ugg wait you're using post, not sure if it returns a jqxhr object
[23:26:51] * Cork nods
[23:26:53] <Cork> it does
[23:31:43] <VectorX> no dice yet, guess ill have to play with it a bit
[23:31:58] <varnie> Hi

[23:41:13] <DeltaHeavy> How can I submit a form I just printed out as an AJAX response?
