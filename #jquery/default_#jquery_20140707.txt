[00:25:40] <JustMozzy> hey everyone. does anyone have a link to a jqeury ui gmap documentation? the one on google code is missing a lot of pages (like addMarker options)
[00:29:13] <Cork> JustMozzy: you would most likely have to either dig in the js file, or contact the plugin developer
[00:29:30] <Cork> that project has nothing to do with jquery except that it depends on it
[00:29:32] <rajsekhar> Hi, I am new to jquery and I have created a code to detect duplicate row. I can able to detect the row but I cant avoid while prepending the row. My query is listed in the given url : http://pastebin.com/7bA6ZQAN
[00:29:48] <rajsekhar> I am getting an alert as
[00:30:02] <rajsekhar> "duplicate row found"
[00:30:13] <Cork> rajsekhar: you need to wait for the document to load
[00:30:15] <rajsekhar> but not able to insert after that
[00:30:23] <Cork> ?g api.jquery.com ready
[00:30:25] <b-ot> Cork: .ready() | jQuery API Documentation → http://api.jquery.com/ready/
[00:31:12] <Cork> rajsekhar: also separate your js from your html
[00:31:20] <Cork> don't use event attributes
[00:31:59] <Cork> rajsekhar: and finally, make a demo in jsfiddle.net
[00:32:12] <rajsekhar> ok Cork you mean I have to use .ready() function
[00:32:40] <Cork> rajsekhar: well as you depend on event attributes
[00:32:51] <Cork> it doesn't really matter the way you have written it
[00:33:02] <Cork> but if you move to event listeners, yes you will
[00:33:13] <Cork> as the script runs before the body has loaded
[00:33:27] <Cork> so you won't be able to attach anything from there
[00:35:49] <rajsekhar> ok thanks Cork
[00:45:40] <ggdevelop> Hi, I have a scroll image and I want it to scroll how can i do so?
[00:46:17] <Cork> scroll image??
[00:46:27] <Cork> what's a scroll image?
[00:48:43] <ggdevelop> Cork:an image of scroller
[00:49:04] <Cork> ggdevelop: uh, you mean a scrollbar replacement?
[00:50:11] <ggdevelop> cork: yes
[00:50:44] <Cork> ggdevelop: then you have to check if the plugin has a function you can call to change the scroll position
[00:50:52] <Cork> if it doesn't; you most likely can't
[00:51:02] <Cork> (this is why you should normally don't use those)
[00:51:09] <Cork> *not use
[00:53:59] <naquad> is there any sample or detailer description of ajax error? i need to tell is it network error, server error or something happened with 3rd party resource
[01:00:11] <marcules> Good Morning
[01:00:24] <Cork> naquad: bind the .fail() handler
[01:00:38] <naquad> http://www.unseenrevolution.com/jquery-ajax-error-handling-function/ found that
[01:00:42] <Cork> the second argument is a description from the brwoser
[01:00:42] <naquad> i understand which handler to use
[01:00:48] <naquad> just jquery doesn't make it easy
[01:01:01] <Cork> naquad: what part of that isn't easy?
[01:01:23] <Cork> $.ajax().fail(function(xhr, status) { console.log(status); });
[01:01:36] <naquad> Cork, i need to check all 3 variables to figure out what has happened? instead of some one error with bunch of constants
[01:02:03] <Cork> naquad: there is basically only one situation where ajax it self is causing the error
[01:02:09] <Cork> and that is parsing errors
[01:02:13] <Cork> everything else is network errors
[01:02:20] <Cork> and jquery knows quite little about those
[01:02:30] <Cork> especially if it is errors by the server
[01:02:36] <Cork> when the server can send what ever it wants
[01:22:58] <rajsekhar> hi Cork here is the link http://jsfiddle.net/Py82x/3/
[01:23:58] <Cork> rajsekhar: something is wrong from line 44+
[01:24:43] <rajsekhar> yes but I cant solve :(
[01:25:21] <Cork> rajsekhar: $(this).children('#example').children('#content') => $('#content')
[01:25:28] <Cork> no need for the complicated relation
[01:25:33] <Cork> and id is page unique
[01:25:36] <Cork> *an
[01:25:43] <rajsekhar> ok
[01:26:01] <Cork> though that might be another problem
[01:26:04] <Cork> you might have invalid html
[01:26:22] <Cork> rajsekhar: if you can get multiple elements with the "same id"
[01:26:26] <Cork> you should use a class instead
[01:28:41] <Cork> ugg this code is a mess...
[01:30:23] <Cork> rajsekhar: ok, this takes too much time to clean up
[01:30:37] <Cork> rajsekhar: the html you have in the string in line 44 and line 45 is really broken
[01:30:46] <Cork> fix that up to be what it should be and post a new link
[01:32:28] <Cork> like ex 'style="text - align: left;"' => 'style="text-align: left;"'
[01:32:59] <Cork> looks like you have similar problems with classes and a long list of other attributes
[01:56:54] <BaNzounet> Hey, is it faster to do something like $('.foo').html(bar).parent().parent().find('#foo-form').hide(); than $('.foo').html(bar); $('#foo-form').hide(); ? And should I only use the second one for readability/"cleanliness"? what do you think guys =) ?
[02:02:05] <Cork> BaNzounet: no, it is slower
[02:02:26] <Cork> ids is unique, and the browser keeps those in a reference hash
[02:02:42] <Cork> so it can grab those extremely fast
[02:03:04] <Cork> BaNzounet: that said though, the the speed difference here is close to none existent
[02:03:31] <Cork> as it is the difference between talking a few dom nodes before checking the hash table
[02:03:36] <Cork> and just checking the hash table
[02:21:17] <BaNzounet> Cork: Okay, thanks man ! :)
[02:21:44] <Cork> BaNzounet: np :)
[02:43:46] <rajsekhar> hi Cork
[02:44:06] <rajsekhar> Its working in my localhost
[02:44:18] <rajsekhar> but I cant resolve the error
[02:44:39] <Cork> rajsekhar: take the html generated and sent to the server
[02:44:57] <Cork> it shouldn't look like what you sent, as it doesn't parse
[02:45:03] <rajsekhar> oh
[03:24:32] <Bogdaniel> good day everyone, i have a problem with this http://pastebin.com/07mV5QvC when i get the details from database and try to add the picture it shows more than once can someone help me out :D?
[03:26:09] <shout> Bogdaniel: your "appendTo".. there's the problem
[03:26:40] <shout> you append to all matches of $(".product-image")
[03:26:48] <shout> you have to be more specific
[03:28:04] <Cork> shout: it could be ok actually
[03:28:12] <Cork> hard to say without seeing the dom structure
[03:29:23] <Bogdaniel> Cork i'll paste the html part
[03:29:30] <Cork> actually on reading the question again
[03:29:37] <Cork> what you want is to change that line
[03:30:02] <Cork> Bogdaniel: $('.product-image').append('<img src="/public/uploads/productPictures/thumbnails/'+ data.ProductPicture + '" />');
[03:30:08] <Cork> should do what you want
[03:30:15] <Bogdaniel> Cork http://pastebin.com/3WE6fbbv
[03:30:43] <Cork> what you did was create a img element and then append it to a list of product-name elements
[03:30:54] <Cork> but as you only have one it will only be added to one of them
[03:31:06] <Cork> if you instead use $().append() you will append the string <img>
[03:31:13] <shout> Bogdaniel: for (var key in data) will look once for every key
[03:31:15] <Cork> so it will generate a dom element for each match
[03:31:23] <shout> {foo: 1, bar: 2} => would loop one for "foo", one for "bar"
[03:31:45] <shout> just remove the for loop and you're probably good to go
[03:31:53] <Cork> ya, and you should use $.each not for ( in )
[03:32:01] <Cork> or use data.hasOwnProperty(key)
[03:32:06] <Bogdaniel> Cork i see
[03:32:16] <Bogdaniel> Cork gimme few minutes to make the changes and see what happens
[03:32:39] <Bogdaniel> Cork i'm not a pro in javascript / jquery learning the ways of dark arts :D
[03:34:24] <Cork> js> var obj = { a: 1 }, keys = ""; Object.prototype.b = 2; for(var key in obj) { keys += " " + key }; print(keys)
[03:34:29] <b-ot> Cork:  a b
[03:34:55] <Cork> ^ cause of that, never ever use for( in ) without hasOwnProperty
[03:35:14] <Cork> $.each does that for you, so that is why you prob want to use that
[03:35:44] <Cork> and for reference
[03:35:46] <Bogdaniel> using $.each() i didn't quite understand how can i get the value based on key
[03:36:18] <Cork> js> var obj = [1,2,3,4] }, keys = ""; Array.prototype.BUUU = null; for(var key in obj) { keys += " " + key }; print(keys)
[03:36:23] <b-ot> Cork: No output.
[03:36:42] <Cork> Bogdaniel: $.each(data, function(key, value) {})
[03:36:56] <Cork> hmm
[03:37:02] <Cork> just noticed, you never use key
[03:37:13] <Cork> are you sure you actually need that one?
[03:37:26] <Bogdaniel> http://pastebin.com/u9iejNiT
[03:37:43] <Cork> Bogdaniel: remove line 19 and 14
[03:37:47] <Cork> uh
[03:37:51] <Cork> line 10 and 14
[03:38:32] <Bogdaniel> that means the entire each
[03:38:35] <Cork> yes
[03:38:42] <Cork> you never use the key loop
[03:38:47] <Cork> so i don't see why you need to have it
[03:39:05] <Bogdaniel> maybe i wrote the code the wrong way :D
[03:39:13] <Cork> it most likely will only create a lot of duplicate things for you
[03:39:20] <Bogdaniel> then .. how can i access the data that comes from the php script /
[03:39:37] <Cork> Bogdaniel: what is the structure of the data from the server?
[03:39:42] <Cork> an array of objects?
[03:40:38] <Bogdaniel> in console it says it's an object
[03:41:02] <Cork> Bogdaniel: console.log(JSON.stringify(data));
[03:42:19] <Bogdaniel> http://pastebin.com/vaTCjjrS
[03:43:02] <palington> hey. i made a situation which is similary to my problem there : http://codepen.io/anon/pen/jsBiD -- what i have is 5 images, and i want to test on each if the TITLE attribute has a specific value (to set different hover images); i don't have much ideas so any help appreciated
[03:44:14] <Cork> Bogdaniel: ok, so you get one response back, so no need for the loop
[03:44:34] <Cork> Bogdaniel: also async: true, is the default, you don't need that line
[03:45:52] <alexxio> hi
[03:46:26] <alexxio> if i change url to the function $.getJSON(url,callback) , does this function retrieves the new url?
[03:47:17] <Cork> alexxio: uh... what else would it fetch?
[03:47:28] <alexxio> it's not working on my side
[03:47:45] <alexxio> i call getJson but i want to change the url
[03:47:58] <alexxio> to use with an http get
[03:47:59] <Cork> palington: you need to do the test in the hover event
[03:48:02] <Cork> not on page load
[03:48:32] <Cork> alexxio: have you even tried?
[03:49:00] <Bogdaniel> Cork i see i thought it's required the async
[03:49:02] <alexxio> i pastebin to be more clear
[03:50:21] <Bogdaniel> Cork so now if i have the data the way i have
[03:50:33] <Bogdaniel> i can access it by data.key ?
[03:51:42] <alexxio> i have this script: http://chopapp.com/#ehpiqgst
[03:52:16] <alexxio> with an onchange on a select i call the changeMonthData(this);
[03:52:52] <alexxio> this ritrieves the first time the url, but if i change the select option, it's not retrieved the new url
[03:53:18] <alexxio> and i don't understand where should i put the new option selected
[04:00:34] <Cork> alexxio: i don't see any event handlers so ya, that is expected
[04:00:58] <alexxio> can you please give me some hint?
[04:01:25] <alexxio> cork: the event handler is <select onchange="changeMonthData(this);">   (out of the script provided)
[04:01:47] <FarLight> how do you see the html in this sandbox?
[04:01:51] <Cork> alexxio: 1. don't use event attributes, use event handlers
[04:02:03] <Cork> 2. changeMonthData doesn't do any ajax call
[04:02:27] <Cork> FarLight: what sandbox?
[04:02:43] <alexxio> cork: can you help me write an ajax call to attach to monthsdata?
[04:02:50] <FarLight> oh I just assumed the chopapp thing he linked to was a sandbox like jsfiddle
[04:03:15] <Cork> FarLight: it looks like a quite bad pastebin wannabe
[04:03:20] <Cork> doesn't look like it let you run anything
[04:03:21] <alexxio> no pastebin was on heavy load an i used it as alternative
[04:03:30] <FarLight> ah ok
[04:03:40] <Cork> alexxio: i suggest using jsbin or jsfiddle instead
[04:03:50] <Cork> much easier to collaborate with
[04:03:51] <alexxio> ok
[04:05:30] <FarLight> is the ajax call you want to make to the file data/data.php?
[04:05:54] <Cork> FarLight: at the top you have a static $.getJSON call
[04:06:08] <Cork> he wants it to be dynamic based on the select change
[04:06:24] <alexxio> http://jsfiddle.net/X7DU9/
[04:06:29] <FarLight> Ah yeah, I figured thats the one he meant, just making sure
[04:09:36] <Cork> alexxio: something like this http://jsfiddle.net/X7DU9/1/
[04:10:33] <Cork> a little cleaner version http://jsfiddle.net/X7DU9/2/
[04:32:23] <trizz> hi
[04:34:09] <FarLight> hello
[04:36:27] <Kamuela> javascript has seem to become a much more general purpose language
[04:36:45] <Kamuela> jquery definitely seems like the javascript of the browser front-end environment
[04:37:03] <Kamuela> wouldn't even call it a library so much anymore, it's a domain specific fork
[04:37:46] <FarLight> Okay
[04:38:01] <FarLight> Hello Kamuela
[04:38:21] <Kamuela> yo
[04:43:45] <Cork> Kamuela: well jquery is (and always has been) mainly about modifying dom elements
[04:44:10] <Cork> so it isn't even frontend, it is more specific then that
[04:44:59] <Kamuela> Cork: right
[04:48:23] <sacho> most of the features jquery currently has are either better served by smaller, specific libraries or in modern browsers.
[04:48:40] <sacho> *or are in*
[04:48:51] <FarLight> but jquery is ubiquitous
[04:49:08] <Kamuela> sacho, so you're saying, that u h8
[04:49:20] <sacho> huh?
[04:50:33] <Cork> sacho: the reason jquery was created is getting removed as a problem
[04:50:40] <Cork> but i still think jquery has a place
[04:50:57] <Cork> though i would like to see some of the more scary features of it removed
[04:51:34] <FarLight> Cork: Do you mean browser fragmentation or difficulty of selecting dom elements?
[04:51:34] <sacho> mhm
[04:51:44] <sacho> both
[04:51:47] <Cork> FarLight: jscript imcompatibility
[04:52:06] <Cork> the problem is shifting to webkit incompatibility instead though
[04:52:32] <sacho> welcome to the days of IE4/5
[04:52:39] <Cork> ya
[04:52:51] <Cork> well ie4 was actually nice back when it came
[04:53:04] <Cork> ie5.5 was when the world has woken up and moved on
[04:53:09] <sacho> so are webkit browsers :)
[04:53:27] <Cork> sacho: no, cause the webkit problems is bugs, not intended
[04:53:39] <Cork> ie4 and 5 was intentionally incompatible
[05:01:26] <alexxio> cork: what about inserting an ajax call in there?
[05:01:45] <Cork> alexxio: what do you mean?
[05:02:03] <alexxio> http://jsfiddle.net/X7DU9/5/
[05:02:48] <Cork> alexxio: i gave you an answer for that ~1h ago
[05:03:12] <alexxio> ops, sorry, maybe i missed it,
[05:03:23] <FarLight> XD you guys
[05:03:45] <alexxio> ah ok, you put a fetchnewdata
[05:11:45] <alexxio> cork: you're intuition is almost working, but i get this error: Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'BTS_AG0028W' of undefined : this seems because it didn't not download the json data.php
[05:12:45] <Cork> alexxio: it is most likely cause e isn't sent to the changeMonthData function
[05:13:56] <alexxio> can you help me deal with it?
[05:15:43] <Cork> alexxio: something like http://jsfiddle.net/X7DU9/7/ ?
[05:16:02] <Cork> i'm driving blind here so... :D
[05:16:56] <alexxio> same error
[05:17:05] <alexxio> and data.php not retrieved
[05:17:17] <alexxio> (i'm watching it by developer tools)
[05:17:19] <FarLight> can you check data.php independently ?
[05:17:37] <alexxio> data.php is correct
[05:18:04] <alexxio> i can also substute it with a static json
[05:18:21] <FarLight> is the alert(data) firing?
[05:18:23] <alexxio> actually it is not retrieved by the gtejson function
[05:18:27] <alexxio> *getjson
[05:18:49] <FarLight> Does your debugging tool tell you if there are any 404's?
[05:19:21] <Cork> alexxio: the updated function fetches for ?bps=<value from select>
[05:19:31] <Cork> might that be the source of your problems?
[05:19:41] <alexxio> nope, it is not retrieven at all
[05:20:05] <alexxio> otherwise i would see it in the list of files at pageload
[05:20:11] <alexxio> and after changed the select
[05:20:41] <FarLight> are you sure the reference data/data.php is correct?
[05:20:50] <alexxio> at the page load, it should automatically ask for data.php
[05:20:57] <alexxio> yes farlight,
[05:20:58] <FarLight> No
[05:21:04] <darkfrog> I've been reading the tutorials about creating jQuery plugins and still have yet to see how to implement a function call within a plugin.  So if I have $(...).myPlugin('doSomething'); how do I support calling the doSomething function?
[05:21:21] <FarLight> it will only call for it when fetchNewData is called
[05:22:13] <alexxio> farlight: you mean changeMonthData
[05:22:33] <alexxio> the select asks for changeMonthData, then the big function will be called
[05:22:52] <FarLight> fetchNewData calls changeMonthData
[05:23:07] <FarLight> Oh and fetchNewData is called at the end of the anonymous function so it should get called right away
[05:23:42] <FarLight> Can you put an alert or a log at the beginning of the fetchNewData function to see if it is called?
[05:24:24] <alexxio> ok
[05:25:03] <alexxio> it's not called
[05:25:29] <alexxio> i putted a alert('ciao'); just after the  function fetchNewData() {
[05:26:20] <FarLight> You are passing a jquery reference to the element with the id month to fetchNewData
[05:26:35] <FarLight> But fetchNewData doesn't take any parameters
[05:27:09] <FarLight> You then assign bts to $(this) and try to call val() on it
[05:27:48] <FarLight> but 'this' isn't referring to an element here
[05:29:48] <alexxio> farlight: what do you siggest?
[05:29:53] <alexxio> *suggest
[05:30:27] <FarLight> To be honest I dont know what this code is supposed to do and I cant test it, but I think maybe you want to add a parameter to the line that defines fetchNewData
[05:30:30] <FarLight> e.g.
[05:30:50] <FarLight> function fetchNewData($monthElement) {
[05:31:37] <FarLight> hello?
[05:31:42] <alexxio> farlight: when i change the select, i want the JSON object be refreshed with the new url=data.php?bts=NEWBTS
[05:32:27] <FarLight> alexxio:
[05:32:29] <FarLight> ah okl
[05:32:39] <FarLight> At the moment it wont do that
[05:32:47] <FarLight> But best to get it working first
[05:32:49] <FarLight> http://jsfiddle.net/X7DU9/10/
[05:33:44] <FarLight> If that works then you just need to call fetchNewData everytime the element is updated
[05:34:31] <alexxio> farlight: what is $monthElement for?
[05:34:40] <alexxio> why there is a $ ??
[05:35:08] <FarLight> In your code you were calling
[05:35:09] <FarLight> fetchNewData($('#month'));
[05:35:09] <alexxio> i mean, how will it be created?
[05:35:15] <FarLight> at the end of the anonymous function
[05:36:05] <FarLight> you were passing a jQuery object to fetchNewData
[05:36:15] <FarLight> But fetchNewData itself wasn't defined to accept any variables
[05:36:22] <FarLight> so I added one called $monthElement
[05:36:33] <FarLight> The dollar sign doesn't mean anything functionally, you can omit it if you want
[05:36:49] <FarLight> but some jQuery developers include it to denote a variable that holds a reference to a jquery object
[05:36:58] <alexxio> ok
[05:37:08] <alexxio> this happens: i put some alert
[05:37:17] <alexxio> the anon function is called
[05:38:34] <alexxio> the anon function is called only at the page load, i get the alert of the anon function put just after the <script>$(function ()  declaration, but when i change the option on the select, that is not called
[05:39:04] <FarLight> yes
[05:39:04] <alexxio> then i put : $.getJSON('data/data.php', { bts: $(this).val() }, function (data) {                 alert('ciao2');
[05:39:10] <alexxio> but ciao2 is never arisen
[05:39:41] <Cork> opps
[05:39:49] <Cork> fetchNewData($('#month')); was meant to be fetchNewData($('#month').val());
[05:40:32] <FarLight> lol ok then you need to change the parameter in fetchNewData too
[05:40:39] <Cork> hmm
[05:40:47] <Cork> wait i need to read the original fiddle again
[05:40:55] <FarLight> Yeah this thing is getting a bit twisted
[05:40:58] <Cork> ahhh
[05:41:09] <Cork> no sorry it was fetchNewData.call($('#month').val())
[05:41:15] <Cork> ...
[05:41:20] <Cork> * fetchNewData.call($('#month'))
[05:41:41] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/X7DU9/11/
[05:41:42] <FarLight> Ah
[05:41:58] <FarLight> Then you just need to somehow call fetchNewData in the update event of #month
[05:42:13] <Cork> it does
[05:42:16] <Cork> line 108
[05:42:42] <FarLight> Ah it does
[05:43:29] <alexxio> ok
[05:43:29] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/X7DU9/12/
[05:43:38] <Cork> just noticed the function is global
[05:44:03] <alexxio> now it loads the data.php on the first page load, but after the select changed not
[05:44:15] <alexxio> with the new url
[05:44:18] <Cork> alexxio: any console errors?
[05:44:28] <alexxio> Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'temperature' of undefined
[05:44:42] <alexxio> because it loads the old json that has not the bts name in it
[05:44:58] <Cork> ok, lets clean up that mess a bit
[05:45:01] <alexxio> ok
[05:49:28] <Cork> alexxio: http://jsfiddle.net/X7DU9/14/
[05:49:40] <Cork> check what gets logged in the console with that
[05:50:07] <Cork> opps left a variable that isn't needed
[05:50:18] <alexxio> wait
[05:50:22] <alexxio> you miss the select on change
[05:50:32] <alexxio> onchange="changeMonthData(this);"
[05:50:37] <Cork> nope http://jsfiddle.net/X7DU9/15/
[05:50:51] <Cork> alexxio: that is moved into the js code
[05:51:00] <Cork> if you check the html section it has an id now
[05:55:31] <alexxio> we're quite there
[05:55:39] <alexxio> i see the page is loaded, the new url is requested
[05:55:55] <alexxio> but i get Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'undefined' of undefined
[05:56:09] <Cork> O_o
[05:56:16] <FarLight> does it tell you a line number?
[05:56:22] <alexxio> 101
[05:56:43] <Cork> alexxio: and it references to what line in the fiddle?
[05:57:36] <alexxio> var monthText = e ? e.options[e.selectedIndex].value : 'BTS_BA0001W',
[05:57:45] <Cork> that isn't used anymore
[05:58:10] <alexxio> oh yes, right, just seen that
[05:58:17] <FarLight> Make sure you copy the entire code from the jsfiddle
[05:58:18] <Cork> btw just noticed an uneeded $() http://jsfiddle.net/X7DU9/16/
[05:58:35] <Cork> doens't affect any functionality, just purity
[06:00:39] <alexxio> if i switch to your code, something is wrong because the page is not loaded fully but i dont get errors
[06:01:37] <alexxio> now i made some modification
[06:02:40] <alexxio> use this
[06:02:40] <alexxio> http://jsfiddle.net/X7DU9/18/
[06:02:52] <davetarmac> Not sure if this is the place to ask, but I will anyway. I've put jPanelMenu on a site I'm developing in the hope of using Bootstrap Collapse.js to make an accordion inide the panel but the panel works, however the accordion doesn't. I think it's to do with instantiation but I'm not sure as accoridng to the markup the jPanelMenu is rendered in code on page load
[06:03:20] <Cork> alexxio: uh, your quite way behind...
[06:03:33] <davetarmac> you can see what I'm talking about here http://thor.proxy.webpos.co.uk/ (to call the menu, there are three lines peeking from behind the logo - I'll fix this shortly!)
[06:03:43] <Cork> this is like back at v7-10
[06:04:37] <Cork> ah... jquery 1.6...
[06:04:41] <harsh343> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24597620/how-to-use-jquery-slider-with-multiple-images
[06:04:50] <Cork> alexxio: your on 1.6 on the site too?
[06:05:07] <Cork> that would explain why quite a few things wouldn't work
[06:05:13] <alexxio> script src="js/jquery-1.11.1.min.js"></script>
[06:05:18] <Cork> so no
[06:05:28] * Cork changes the framework version in the fiddle
[06:06:31] <Cork> alexxio: is BTS_BA0001W meant to be an option in the dropdown?
[06:07:31] <alexxio> cork:yes
[06:08:05] <alexxio> i load the select option, that will return a new json
[06:08:18] <alexxio> with the new datadata
[06:08:25] <Cork> alexxio: http://jsfiddle.net/X7DU9/20/
[06:08:29] <Cork> that should work then
[06:09:05] <Cork> if it doesn't
[06:09:07] <alexxio> wait, of course in the version i'm trying i have the right options
[06:09:32] <FarLight> davetarmac: Can you point to where you instantiate the accordion and panel?
[06:09:43] <Cork> if that doesn't work there isn't much more i can do without a working example
[06:10:33] <Cork> blind driving can only take you so far, and we're heading for the ditch
[06:11:48] <davetarmac> FarLight: the accordion should instantiate automatically since I'm using data-attributes
[06:12:13] <JenniferB2> hi folks... how can i modify the style of a css class?
[06:12:28] <Cork> JenniferB2: you normally don't
[06:12:28] <JenniferB2> note, I want to take an exisiting class, and modify its properties
[06:12:40] <JenniferB2> Cork, but i want too!
[06:12:52] <davetarmac> FarLight: the jPanelMenu is started in http://thor.proxy.webpos.co.uk/skin/frontend/gravdept/acumen/js/jquery.run.js
[06:13:00] <Cork> JenniferB2: it is STRONGLY discouraged
[06:13:10] <JenniferB2> why?
[06:13:13] <FarLight> When you say css class
[06:13:16] <Cork> JenniferB2: cause it is very bad for performance
[06:13:18] <davetarmac> FarLight: that jquery.run.js is called on ln2331 of the home apge
[06:13:22] <FarLight> what do you mean
[06:13:41] <Cork> JenniferB2: what you do is create a new css class and just set that on the element you want to override things for
[06:13:43] <Cork> or a parent
[06:13:49] <JenniferB2> hmm ... but I want to change the width depending on screen size for certain elements
[06:13:57] <Cork> you don't live modify stylesheats
[06:14:08] <Cork> JenniferB2: then use @media
[06:14:11] <FarLight> Cork: That depends
[06:14:12] <Cork> no need for js
[06:14:25] <FarLight> @media is the best solution here though
[06:14:26] <b-ot> FarLight: memorised “media”.
[06:14:35] <Cork> lol
[06:14:54] <FarLight> ha? What does it mean I memorized media?
[06:15:00] <Cork> ?media
[06:15:00] <b-ot> Cork: the best solution here though
[06:15:02] <Cork> :)
[06:15:13] <FarLight> lol
[06:16:21] <FarLight> Sorry davetarmac I dont have the skill to debug this without being able to run my changes, but are you making sure the functionality of the accordions are being added after the panel is created?
[06:16:39] <FarLight> If you try to attach events to elements that don't yet exist nothing will happen
[06:17:43] <FarLight> Maybe make sure the accordion file is the last one you include
[06:20:50] <davetarmac> FarLight: that would mean putting bootstrap.js as the last js file to be loaded...
[06:21:00] <davetarmac> shouldn't hurt too much - I'll give it a bash
[06:21:37] <FarLight> davetarmac: Cool but take what I say with a grain of salt, I really have no idea, sorry :P
[06:21:48] <davetarmac> FarLight: yeah, that didn't work :)
[06:21:51] <davetarmac> no worries
[06:22:16] <davetarmac> be easier if I were getting some errors
[06:22:59] <FarLight> yeah its weird, cause when you click the group items, they get the collapsed class added and removed as needed
[06:24:36] <FarLight> so at least one part of the js is working
[06:26:26] <davetarmac> it's just being a d**k :p
[06:26:55] <FarLight> lol
[06:35:15] <alexxio> cork: i'm producing a working script
[06:35:22] <alexxio> :) will send you pm
[06:36:14] <thaifood> Hi, Anyone know a way to set my button as default when you hit enter AFTER typing in search criteria ? http://fpaste.org/115989/14047400/
[06:45:28] <FarLight> thaifood: You mean when they type their search query, the button gets focus?
[06:45:35] <FarLight> Or the button's event fires?
[06:49:19] <thaifood> The input has autofocus and so they can start typing immediately,  when they hit enter though I want the button to fire
[06:49:40] <FarLight> Does that not happen automatically if you put the whole thing in a form?
[06:49:46] <FarLight> And make the button a submit element?
[06:50:58] <FarLight> are you binding an event to the button, or just forwarding to a url?
[06:54:43] <alexxio> cork: did you see the js sample on the real machine?
[06:59:39] <d0de> I'm trying to use an array of 5000 strings in some code and I'm getting a "maximum call stack size exceeded" error on page load in jsfiddle. What should I do?
[07:00:23] <thaifood> i guess i just need to put them both in a form  http://fpaste.org/115996/40474160/
[07:00:46] <FarLight> thaifood: Did it work?
[07:00:56] <thaifood> building form now
[07:02:31] <FarLight> d0de: Are you sure you don't have a loop that doesn't finish in your code?
[07:03:25] <FarLight> Or some kind of recursive function that never reaches an end?
[07:03:26] <thaifood> that works, thank so much
[07:04:08] <FarLight> thaifood: Great, but is it necessary to bind a click event? Why can't you use the native form functionality of the browser?
[07:04:14] <d0de> FarLight, will double check
[07:04:18] <FarLight> Not that it matters if it works :P
[07:06:05] <youknowmyname> I have a simple question: how does uglify work? Does it run, and write uglified code straight into the target directory, or does it create a temporary file and then replace target with the prepared file when task is over?
[07:06:21] <thaifood> click no longeer needed
[07:06:27] <thaifood> thanks again FarLight  !
[07:06:36] <FarLight> thaifood: Great :D
[07:06:48] <FarLight> thaifood: Handy if people disable js
[07:06:51] <thaifood> it's nice building something that is intuitive
[07:07:06] <thaifood> i care not about people who disable js :-)
[07:07:31] <FarLight> haha
[07:07:40] <d0de> oh lord
[07:08:29] <d0de> I just got back from a 1 week vacation. Not only did I use "|" instead of "," as an array separator, I didn't catch it after staring at it for 10 minutes
[07:09:12] <thaifood> d0de: you're not really back yet :-)
[07:09:23] <FarLight> :P
[07:09:52] <d0de> how on earth did I do that? That's like spintax or something
[07:10:10] <AusME> Apparently I lack the vocabulary to talk to Google and so I'd like some help on what words I should use. Unload has a special meaning within Jquery, but essentially, I'd like to unload the existing version of Jquery. What word should I use instead of Unload?
[07:12:05] <FarLight> AusME: Sorry bout what do you mean unload the existing version of jquery?
[07:12:07] <FarLight> haha
[07:12:19] <NoiseEee> AusME: you don't get to 'unload' a loaded script
[07:12:24] <AusME> O.
[07:12:31] <NoiseEee> AusME: what problem are you trying to solve
[07:12:59] <FarLight> Did you try reading the file backwards XD ?
[07:13:41] <AusME> I want to introduce some nice UI elements within my application and I have an existing version of JQuery which is used in different places. I can't easily upgrade the existing version and loading two versions would be difficult since the nice UI elements are used to the $() instead of whatever I'd alias a new version to. So, I thought I'd unload the existing version, then load the nice UI elements.
[07:14:26] <FarLight> Even if that were possible I would recommend against doing it.
[07:14:37] <AusME> What would you recommend?
[07:14:54] <FarLight> Actually doesn't jquery give you the option of specifying what variable it uses?
[07:15:35] <FarLight> Oh but you said the elements still use the dollar sign
[07:15:59] <FarLight> I don't have a solution for you AusME I'm sorry :(
[07:16:38] <AusME> Ah well. Thanks for the attempt. :)
[07:18:35] <davetarmac> Anyone using slidebars.js?
[07:21:51] <thaifood> FarLight:  enter works on the form but click doesn't so i guess i need a listener to submit the form too
[07:22:47] <FarLight> click doesn't work on the form?
[07:22:59] <thaifood> right
[07:23:04] <FarLight> like when they click the submit button it doesn't submit? or you aren't showing the submit button
[07:23:57] <AusME> I wonder what would happen if I do a simple find and replace in the nice UI elements for $ and replaced it with $$ then aliased the new version of JQuery to $$.
[07:23:58] <thaifood> i had the type set to text, change to submit and it works
[07:24:00] <thaifood> yay
[07:24:35] <FarLight> thaifood: Ah nice  :D
[07:24:48] <FarLight> AusME: good idea
[07:27:43] <NoiseEee> AusME: http://api.jquery.com/jquery.noconflict/
[07:34:07] <AusME> oh...
[07:34:10] <AusME> I see.
[07:34:14] <AusME> NoiseEee: Thank you.
[07:34:31] <AusME> Incidentally, where does your nick come from? the Eee sounds like something from WingCommander but NoiseEee?
[07:34:50] <NoiseEee> just made up really. i like noise rock music
[07:35:11] <host-x> hi all
[07:35:33] <host-x> i need button print in datatable plugin
[07:35:40] <host-x> someone help me ?
[07:40:27] <tandroid> What's the best way to determine if a jquery method is valid in the version of jquery you're using?
[07:40:52] <tandroid> I find navigating the documentation to be a bit confusing in that regard.
[07:42:06] <AusME> NoiseEee: Just to make sure I understand. If I noconclifct the existing version of Jquery like this var j = jQuery.noConflict(); then after I'm done doing whatever I do with the new version of JQuery then I can do this? var $ = j.noConflict(); ?
[07:42:56] <paulvd> hey guys, anyone knows of a lightbox plugin which opens like this or similar to this http://www.skyhighnetworks.com/ ( click on the big play button (
[07:44:21] <NoiseEee> AusME: no... see the example/result "Completely move jQuery to a new namespace in another object."
[07:45:15] <NoiseEee> AusME: either that or the one after it, depends on what you need i guess
[07:49:59] <Archer_xda> tandroid - look up typeof - it will do exactly what you need
[07:50:56] <Archer_xda> tandroid - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/typeof
[07:59:42] <youknowmyname> Hello! I have a simple question: how does uglify work? Does it run, and write uglified code straight into the target directory, or does it create a temporary file and then replace target with the prepared file when task is over?
[08:00:14] <Archer_xda> youknowmyname - what happened when you tried it?
[08:00:38] <d0de> as a toy for generating code names, does this look ok? http://jsfiddle.net/SwWZ9/8/
[08:05:25] <decx> you have a long dict
[08:06:52] <BillCriswell> Fucking IE.
[08:08:05] <BillCriswell> I'm fading in an element with jQuery and inside that element I'm trying to do a transition with a delay. IE10 just ignores the transition completely.
[08:14:58] <decx> you're always animating something
[08:15:28] <decx> did you add -ms- prefix like a good boy?
[08:16:15] <BillCriswell> decx: Yes.
[08:16:42] <BillCriswell> IE ignores a css transition when jQuery is fading in the parent element.
[08:17:01] <BillCriswell> As soon as I take it out of a parent that's being faded it works fine.
[08:17:11] <BillCriswell> Just annoying that I have to move around HTML to get it to behave.
[08:18:01] <Archer_xda> BillCriswell - would using .animate() help?
[08:18:25] <BillCriswell> Archer_xda: I don't believe so.
[08:19:00] <Archer_xda> I tend to use that over transitions purely for x-browser issues, but if it won't help then I'll just shut up :)
[08:19:43] <BillCriswell> Haha I'm always willing to listen.
[08:20:02] <BillCriswell> This is luckily for a kiosk so I don't need to worry about cross browser issues TOO much.
[08:20:08] <decx> animate(), crossbrowser ready for the price of only 600 repaints per second
[08:20:31] <Archer_xda> For animations that normally take 500ms :p
[08:20:47] <abishek> is there a way to find out if a color hex is dark or light using jquery?
[08:21:03] <BillCriswell> I should have used ALL css animations instead of mixing in the jQuery stuff. Not sure what I was thinking but it's a bit late to switch it up now.
[08:21:38] <BillCriswell> I could definitely take some of the blame, but Chrome had no problem with it.
[08:22:48] <decx> abishek not in jquery, but there are several ways for this, either evaluating the hex or converting to hsl
[08:29:51] <harsh343> can any one correct this slider for me
[08:29:53] <harsh343> http://jsfiddle.net/Harsh343/Tfy8h/1/
[08:33:50] <d0de> harsh343, what's the problem with it?
[08:34:15] <harsh343> it shows 6-7-8 on last
[08:34:22] <harsh343> when i right click
[08:34:54] <harsh343> i need 1-2-3 then 4-5-6 then 7-8-9 and same reverse order on left click
[08:35:51] <tandroid> Archer_xda: I wasn't very clear, I know how to find which ones are undefined, but I find it frustrating to figure out what to use instead.
[08:36:48] <tandroid> For instance, if .css() isn't supported, is there something else that accomplishes the same thing in older versions? If so, how would I figure this out?
[08:39:09] <decx> when would css not be supported?
[08:40:15] <tandroid> It wouldn't, bad example.
[08:40:23] <duch_kazatel> what's going on now?
[08:40:25] <decx> navigator.userAgent.match(/Mosaic/i) ^^
[08:49:14] <oste> anyone know of an rdfa editor?
[08:49:32] <oste> for live editing
[08:49:49] <duch_kazatel> http://rdfa.info/tools/
[08:49:53] <duch_kazatel> the first link ;)
[08:50:56] <decx> https://www.google.com/webmasters/markup-helper/
[08:51:50] <BillCriswell> harsh343: Do you plan on making this responsive or anything like that? This can become a pretty big task depending on what you're trying to support with it.
[08:56:48] <duch_kazatel> dead in here today.
[08:57:15] <harsh343> <BillCriswell>   I  do not want to become responsive
[09:00:00] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: The 4th kicked everyones ass.
[09:00:06] <BillCriswell> I went too America.
[09:00:09] <duch_kazatel> apparently - how was yours?
[09:00:11] <duch_kazatel> hahahahaha
[09:00:41] <BillCriswell> It was pretty awesome. Yours?
[09:01:09] <duch_kazatel> it was good - went down to my dad's boat and anchored out overnight.  watched the fireworks display that Baron Hilton puts on each year.
[09:01:11] <duch_kazatel> lots of fun.
[09:01:28] <BillCriswell> Sounds awesome.
[09:01:35] <duch_kazatel> what'd you do?
[09:02:48] <BillCriswell> Drink, swim and BBQ till about 4am at my friend's house.
[09:02:57] <duch_kazatel> very nice.
[09:03:13] <BillCriswell> Yes. Founders All Day IPA literally all day.
[09:03:23] <duch_kazatel> sounds tasy
[09:03:28] <duch_kazatel> *tasty
[09:04:05] <BillCriswell> Yeah it was great.
[09:04:45] <BillCriswell> harsh343: Are there a variable number of images that can go into this? Are the sizes adjustable?
[09:05:32] <BillCriswell> Doing it again next weekend since it was a good turn out. About 50 people showed up.
[09:06:32] <duch_kazatel> sounds awesome.  we're doing a big shindig this upcoming saturday - 20-30 people.  not 50 though - thats sounds huge.
[09:07:34] <BillCriswell> We normally invite out like 100 people (facebook event) and only 15 or so show up.. so I guess everyone was just in the mood haha.
[09:15:07] <decx> i had some poultry on friday
[09:15:11] <decx> bald eagle steak
[09:15:59] <sdubois__> working on removing live from my code. would $('tbody>tr>td', this.dom.table).live( 'mouseover mouseout', function (e) become $(document).on('mouseover mouseout', 'tbody>tr>td, this.dom.table',  function (e)
[09:16:35] <duch_kazatel> sdubois__ no.
[09:17:09] <duch_kazatel> $('tbody>tr>td', this.dom.table) is the same as $(this.dom.table).find('tbody>tr>td')
[09:17:43] <duch_kazatel> if possible, do something like $(this.dom.table).on('mouseover mouseout', 'tbody>tr>td',  function (e)
[09:17:58] <sdubois__> ok, thats what i thought
[09:17:59] <sdubois__> thanks
[09:18:08] <inDux> Has anyone worked with twitter bootstrap's .collapse-down inside of an isotope-item?
[09:18:16] <duch_kazatel> !ask @ inDux
[09:18:16] <b-ot> inDux: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[09:19:18] <inDux> Is there a workaround to make bootstrap's .collapse down work with magic isotope-items? When I resize the page they play nice but they won't otherwise
[09:19:18] <BillCriswell> decx: Is that like an anti-american meal?
[09:20:18] <decx> no that's freedom steak with freedom fries sidedish
[09:20:50] <BillCriswell> Did you really eat eagle? Because now I am curious.
[09:20:53] <decx> i devour freedom and shit comes out a day later, what could be more american
[09:21:05] <decx> no i think that's illegal
[09:21:10] <jParkton> it is
[09:21:14] <jParkton> but humerous
[09:21:33] <BillCriswell> Illegal, legal, what's the difference.

[09:22:19] <duch_kazatel> almost as merican as asking a frenchmen "can you speak german?" and when they say no you say "you're welcome."
[09:22:29] <BillCriswell> Carpe Diem, YOLO for intelligent people.
[09:22:56] <BillCriswell> Seize the fish.
[09:27:45] <decx> which is a blatant misrepresenation of the actual quote BillCriswell
[09:28:15] <decx> it is carpe diem because we must make a better tomorrow today
[09:28:25] <decx> not because tomorrow we might be dead anyway
[09:29:27] <duch_kazatel> exactly - YOLO for intelligent people ;)
[09:29:52] <duch_kazatel> "improve the world around me" vs "welp i might die hurr durr"
[09:30:00] <decx> i guess, good point ^^
[09:32:36] <decx> "helped an old man pass the street, yolo"
[09:34:23] <BillCriswell> "pass the street"?
[09:34:35] <duch_kazatel> probably meant "cross"
[09:34:37] <BillCriswell> Never heard it said like that.
[09:34:47] <decx> no i actually meant pass the stone
[09:34:54] <decx> yolo indeed!
[09:34:55] <BillCriswell> What a saint.
[09:35:01] <duch_kazatel> you haven't lived until you've heard somebody say "close the light"
[09:35:13] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: Haha. My grandmother says that.
[09:36:21] <monk12> hey all, just curious... I have some html/js text being returned in JSON so it looks like {"question_text": "Text before <script>google_analytics_code();//some comment\nMy();</script> Text After"} ...
[09:36:21] <duch_kazatel> batty.  i had a lot of coworkers who spoke urdu and similar languages - apparently that's the literal translation for "turn off the light".
[09:36:37] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: That's interesting. Never had any idea.
[09:36:46] <monk12> in jquery 1.7.1 seems to not like the comment in the string....as if its commenting out the outer JSON string
[09:37:12] <monk12> and therefore bringing back invalid JSON. im not really sure about this, jsut wanted confirmation you cant have comments within a JSON string.
[09:37:30] <duch_kazatel> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/244777/can-i-comment-a-json-file
[09:37:37] <duch_kazatel> monk12 you can't put comments in JSON.
[09:38:02] <monk12> darn, yep i saw that link already. was hoping a way to get passed it if the html being returned is freeform and our users can insert some simple JS.
[09:38:28] <monk12> one comment on that one or another one said they may have a way to get passed or escape it. not sure if newer jquery allows.
[09:38:30] <duch_kazatel> nope.  keep in mind, JSON isn't javascript, so it has some slightly different rules.
[09:38:45] <duch_kazatel> monk12 this isn't a jquery thing, it's a javascript thing.
[09:40:26] <monk12> duch_kazatel: just saying, some libs may allow comments or certain kind of comments based on this response there "Depends on your json library, Json.net supports javascript style comments /* commment */"
[09:40:44] <Cork> monk12: no, they can't
[09:40:54] <Cork> the spec for json doens't include comments
[09:40:59] <duch_kazatel> exactly.
[09:41:21] <Cork> monk12: you can send an object in javascript if you like though
[09:41:40] <Cork> then you won't have those limitations (or security)
[09:42:17] <jParkton> you 'can' include comments in a json but its hacky
[09:42:19] <jParkton> and gross
[09:42:21] <monk12> The spec doesn't but can't some libs (their JSON parser at least) can right? 2 comments seem to imply that. wasn't sure if jquery just does a simple eval or something.
[09:42:33] <Cork> jParkton: no you can't, not if you want to send valid json
[09:42:35] <jParkton> its a hack
[09:42:43] <jParkton> the json spec does not allow comments
[09:42:49] <Cork> if by hack you mean not sending json; sure
[09:43:34] <duch_kazatel> http://timelessrepo.com/json-isnt-a-javascript-subset - this should be required reading imo.
[09:43:47] <monk12> like i'm assuming server-side in java (via Jackson) there is a setting to allow comments based on this comment: http://stackoverflow.com/a/21613658/201156
[09:44:13] <monk12> or maybe that's only setting comments, but nothing can read them? not sure. thought I'd ask what that comment meant.
[09:44:43] <duch_kazatel> monk12 again, the JSON spec doesn't allow comments.  some frameworks and libraries might have options to change that, but once you do that, you're no longer deaing with JSON.
[09:45:00] <jParkton> oh because when using json validator and it does validate the hacky comments you are still correct?
[09:45:04] <jParkton> ass hat
[09:45:31] <Cork> monk12: except you wouldn't be using json
[09:45:32] <duch_kazatel> as a result, you might run into weird corner cases when trying to communicate between two different domains, like your frontend and backend.
[09:45:35] <jParkton> monk12: there are a few blogs showing how to do it, but since the json spec doesnt support it best not to waste your time with it
[09:45:38] <Cork> monk12: you would be sending javascript
[09:45:51] <Cork> as you can't fit what you want to do into the json standard
[09:46:07] <Cork> meaning text string with comments can't ever be json
[09:46:46] <Cork> monk12: you can do what you want as soon as you remove the requirement for it to be json
[09:47:40] <Cork> and the reason for using json instead of some random proprietary format, is built in cross language support
[09:47:49] <Cork> and you only get that if you follow the spec
[09:48:18] <duch_kazatel> Cork++
[09:50:14] <Cork> monk12: to give an existing example, msxml isn't xml
[09:50:34] <Cork> it is an extended backwards (but not forward) compatible standard
[09:50:57] <Cork> and it is looked on as one of the worst things microsoft has produced
[09:51:16] <Cork> as it breaks the standard, without giving any good reason to
[09:52:23] <monk12> K. I'll try and remove the comments in our system (its an non-ajax web app and we moving it towards ajax)... so I can update all text in the system via sql update... or escape it ina  certain way and unescape it if the JS comments are needed in the text for our reference
[09:53:20] <Cork> monk12: an alternative could be to just parse the code server side, and then encode it to json
[09:53:22] <Cork> and send that
[09:53:29] <monk12> things like Double-Click/conversions javascript marketing inserts .... or custom JS that does somethings on certain questions in our questionnaires that I commented on are the issues.

[10:12:14] <cannap> hi any know this site with starting with u.. or h.. dont know there has only the best jquery plugins :D
[10:12:17] <cannap> forgot the name
[10:13:22] <cannap> Found http://www.unheap.com/
[10:13:23] <cannap> ;D
[10:18:27] <blakespot> greetings
[10:21:09] <duch_kazatel> hello
[10:46:40] <duch_kazatel> in case you missed it: http://w3c.github.io/elements-of-html/
[10:47:22] <BillCriswell> There was so online game about how many css properties and html elements you can name in a minute... I did embarrassingly well.
[11:02:31] <Voyage> If I know Angular or backbone. how fast can I learn Ember? to which it is most similar to?
[11:04:32] <elisa87> http://jsfiddle.net/6R9dP/ any idea how to fix this so that when I use it in my phone and flip it (landscape mode) it can be shown the whole image rather than just the whole image? I don't want to scroll down
[11:05:07] <duch_kazatel> "it can be shown the whole image rather than just the whole image?"
[11:05:08] <duch_kazatel> lol
[11:10:35] <pcfreak30> if I have a select box as a base reference, how can I best get the last sibling?
[11:11:20] <duch_kazatel> .siblings().last()
[11:12:35] <johngrogg> If I published a jquery plugin using the github jQuery Plugins webhook, why would two pages get created for it on plugins.jquery.com?
[11:12:58] <johngrogg> both pointing to the same github repo even
[11:13:13] <pcfreak30> duch_kazatel: $(this).parent().find('select').size() - 1 vs $(this).siblings().index()
[11:13:21] <pcfreak30> which is a better method?
[11:13:33] <duch_kazatel> wat
[11:13:51] <duch_kazatel> depends on what you're doing since those aren't identical, but I'd go with the latter.
[11:13:54] <pcfreak30> I have a select and trying to see if its the last element in its div
[11:14:05] <pcfreak30> on a change event
[11:14:08] <Voyage> what If I want to make a CRM and want to delegate most or all the MVC to client? what to use.? ember, angular, backbone?
[11:15:27] <duch_kazatel> Voyage depends on which appeals to you the most.
[11:15:50] <pcfreak30> duch_kazatel: they give the same result, 1st is the count from parent children of selects minus one for index, other is the last siblings index
[11:16:08] <duch_kazatel> pcfreak30 sure, but they're not identical in how they operate.
[11:16:13] <duch_kazatel> i'd still go with the latter.
[11:16:17] <Voyage> duch_kazatel,  each has a use case
[11:16:19] <pcfreak30> duch_kazatel: THats why I am asking
[11:16:20] <pcfreak30> :P
[11:17:03] <duch_kazatel> pcfreak30 if you want to check if it's last, i'd look at using is()
[11:17:29] <Techdeck> hey guys, I have many divs inside a container div that has overflow-y: scroll. I'm trying to run a $(".oneOfThoseDivs").position().top on one of the divs inside, and it seems to change when I scroll the container. Is there a way to get a div's position from the top regardless of the scrollTop? (I tried position and offset())
[11:17:36] <pcfreak30> duch_kazatel:  what is the css selector?
[11:18:38] <duch_kazatel> $(this).is('last-child') iirc.
[11:19:04] <pcfreak30> no :?
[11:19:08] <Techdeck> anyone?
[11:19:15] <duch_kazatel> err, :last-child
[11:19:24] <pcfreak30> Techdeck: Need a jsfiddle
[11:23:47] <BillCriswell> Techdeck: I can't replicate that.
[11:24:15] <BillCriswell> Techdeck: offset() works for me.
[11:26:56] <BillCriswell> Techdeck: http://jsbin.com/rovup/1/edit?html,css,js,output might help
[11:29:37] <ecky--ptang-zoob> Anyone using live reload with gulp?
[11:30:11] <Evil_Work> So what do I have to do to get .serialize() to work in IE9?
[11:30:11] <BillCriswell> ecky--ptang-zoob: I have.
[11:30:39] <ecky--ptang-zoob> Any idea what this means? connect deprecated connect(middleware): use app.use(middleware) instead
[11:30:43] <BillCriswell> Evil_Work: As far as I know it works. Have a demo of it not working?
[11:31:11] <ecky--ptang-zoob> I did exactly as described here: https://github.com/AveVlad/gulp-connect - why is this error appearing?
[11:31:20] <Evil_Work> Not as such.  It works as is in Chrome and FF, but it only returns one key-value pair in IE9.
[11:31:41] <duch_kazatel> Evil_Work usually means you have a \n somewhere it shouldn't be or something funky.
[11:33:31] <BillCriswell> ecky--ptang-zoob: Never used connect. I've only used livereload with it.
[11:33:54] <ecky--ptang-zoob> ic
[11:37:43] <str8uplinux> trying to append next to the closest span with class of "rate" but i'm not sure what i'm doing wrong... http://jsfiddle.net/KEBAB/
[11:37:53] <str8uplinux> text** not next
[11:39:09] <Techdeck> BillCriswell, thanks, let me look at your example
[11:39:17] <duch_kazatel> str8uplinux you want .siblings()
[11:39:22] <duch_kazatel> .closest() traverses up.
[11:39:41] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/KEBAB/1/
[11:40:12] <ecky--ptang-zoob> BillCriswell I'm using livereload now and gulp says main.css was reloaded when I alter a sass file, but the browser does not change anything
[11:40:57] <ecky--ptang-zoob> oh nvm, extension was disabled
[11:41:00] <str8uplinux> duch_kazatel: ahhh thanks!
[11:41:05] <BillCriswell> ecky--ptang-zoob: Haha nice.
[11:41:15] <BillCriswell> Yeah, that icon isn't very obvious if it's connected or not.
[11:41:31] <ecky--ptang-zoob> noaXess, it's the same in both states!
[11:41:37] <ecky--ptang-zoob> no*
[11:41:38] <Techdeck> BillCriswell, do you see my changes to your jsbin?
[11:41:55] <BillCriswell> ecky--ptang-zoob: Haha when it's on the little black dot is filled in.
[11:42:03] <Techdeck> BillCriswell, to reproduce my issue, I just added a height:200px to .items and overflow:scroll;
[11:42:08] <ecky--ptang-zoob> lol
[11:42:15] <ecky--ptang-zoob> didn't even see that
[11:42:28] <Techdeck> I also added: setTimeout(function() {   alert($(".item:eq(2)").position().top) }, 4000)
[11:42:40] <Techdeck> hit run js, then scroll it down and wait - you'll see the issue
[11:42:50] <Techdeck> it says the position().top of item 2 is below 0
[11:43:18] <BillCriswell> ecky--ptang-zoob: Yeah, why they didn't make it like... green or something is beyond me.
[11:43:24] <Evil_Work> duch_kazatel: Would having an empty string for a value in a select do it?
[11:43:47] <duch_kazatel> EvilPenguin do what now?
[11:43:54] <duch_kazatel> err, Evil_Work
[11:43:57] <duch_kazatel> bad autocomplete
[11:44:22] <Evil_Work> Well I have three options in a select menu, and one of them is a "Choose One" with an empty string for a form value
[11:44:22] <Techdeck> BillCriswell, sorry it took me so long to respond, I was in a meeting
[11:44:58] <duch_kazatel> Evil_Work i have no idea what you're talking about... do what?
[11:45:02] <BillCriswell> Techdeck: Hmmm
[11:45:26] <Evil_Work> <select name="foo"><option value="">Choose One</option></select>
[11:45:28] <Techdeck> BillCriswell, I could fix this if I had used the scrollTop of the container, problem is, I'm getting different outputs on different browsers
[11:45:35] <Evil_Work> duch_kazatel: ^^
[11:45:47] <duch_kazatel> Evil_Work you're not making any sense.  start over.
[11:46:01] <duch_kazatel> Evil_Work "Would having an empty string for a value in a select do it?" <- do what?
[11:46:03] <ecky--ptang-zoob> why didn't i use livereload 5 years ago?
[11:46:09] <Techdeck> I'm actually building a TV app, and their browser is not very standardized, in their browser, position() works as expected
[11:46:14] <Evil_Work> duch_kazatel: Make .serialize() not work in IE9
[11:46:40] <duch_kazatel> oh that.  it shouldn't matter, but I'd try taking it out.
[11:46:52] <Evil_Work> I did.  No change.
[11:47:01] <Evil_Work> So I guess I answered my own question.
[11:47:05] <duch_kazatel> please create a fiddle then :)
[11:47:34] * Techdeck headdesks
[11:48:33] <BillCriswell> Techdeck: Looks like .offsetTop stores what you need?
[11:48:40] <dacia> hi
[11:48:45] <BillCriswell> Techdeck: http://jsbin.com/rovup/2/edit?js,output
[11:49:11] <dacia> is ben alman online?
[11:49:32] <duch_kazatel> dacia looks like they might be - what's up?
[11:49:38] <Techdeck> BillCriswell: yes!! thank you!
[11:49:48] <BillCriswell> Techdeck: Sweeeet.
[11:49:48] <Techdeck> let me try it on the other browser
[11:49:51] <dacia> i have a question
[11:49:58] <duch_kazatel> dacia just ask it then :)
[11:49:59] <ecky--ptang-zoob> BillCriswell I have this watch task: http://pastebin.com/jNvAjx2n - but it hangs on starting watch when running gulp ... without the 4th watch it works, is there anything wrong with it?
[11:50:28] <Techdeck> BillCriswell, works like a charm, thanks again!
[11:50:35] <BillCriswell> Techdeck: No problem!
[11:51:06] <BillCriswell> ecky--ptang-zoob: You probably want to watch the css directory and not the sass directory.
[11:51:23] <dacia> i was using the php proxy of ben alman, but it doesnt work at all
[11:51:57] <duch_kazatel> daciac you'll likely have more help in a channel dedicated to php in that case.
[11:52:06] <Evil_Work> the hell.. if you can't do a document.write in a jsfiddle how the heck are you supposed to see the result?
[11:52:11] <ecky--ptang-zoob> no...
[11:52:32] <dacia> sorry, but im new
[11:52:34] <duch_kazatel> Evil_Work you shouldn't be using document.write anyway.  console.log() is a good option.
[11:52:34] <BillCriswell> Evil_Work: console.log()
[11:52:40] <duch_kazatel> or .append()
[11:52:42] <Evil_Work> :P
[11:52:46] <dacia> i dont know what you are usually talking about
[11:53:05] <ecky--ptang-zoob> "livereload is connecting" - is it connected or not??
[11:53:15] <duch_kazatel> dacia you're in a channel dedicated to jquery, not php.
[11:53:22] <BillCriswell> ecky--ptang-zoob: It says "connecting" so no.
[11:53:23] <dacia> what
[11:53:29] <dacia> wtf
[11:53:33] <dacia> that was wrong
[11:53:34] <dacia> sorry
[11:53:37] <dacia> :(
[11:53:37] <ecky--ptang-zoob> grrr it worked and now it's ruined
[11:53:42] <duch_kazatel> dacia it's fine.
[11:53:59] <dacia> but i dont like jquery
[11:54:02] <dacia> i dont use it
[11:54:07] <dacia> i rather use pure js
[11:54:13] <duch_kazatel> dacia then why did you join this channel?
[11:54:22] <dacia> i dont know
[11:54:33] <ecky--ptang-zoob> why would you rather use pure js? you're making your life harder than it needs to be
[11:54:40] <duch_kazatel> lol if you want help on your question, try to join #php instead.
[11:55:13] <dacia> jquery is unnecessary overhead
[11:55:32] <BillCriswell> ecky--ptang-zoob: http://pastie.org/pastes/9364968/text is basically what I use.
[11:55:36] <duch_kazatel> you've got a lot of people here who would disagree with you there.
[11:56:00] <BillCriswell> ecky--ptang-zoob: You should be looking at the destination files, not the source, since the reload may happen before the file you're writing to is ready.
[11:56:07] <ecky--ptang-zoob> but you're not monitoring php or html files then?
[11:56:30] <BillCriswell> ecky--ptang-zoob: Add those to the array in the last watch
[11:56:52] <ecky--ptang-zoob> ok
[11:57:13] <BillCriswell> ecky--ptang-zoob: I'm still working on my flow for this. I really like the idea of a /src and /build directory so I can just watch /build/**/* and do the reload
[11:57:23] <BillCriswell> but I'm still learning it myself.
[11:57:26] <ecky--ptang-zoob> what does **/* mean?
[11:57:55] <BillCriswell> It's like any child file in any child directory
[11:58:01] <BillCriswell> I'm probably workding that horribly.
[12:00:05] <BillCriswell> Basically /foo/**/* would be notified of any change inside of /foo/
[12:07:31] <ecky--ptang-zoob> BillCriswell: can you also do js live reloads?
[12:08:40] <BillCriswell> Yeah, same way you do css.
[12:08:50] <ecky--ptang-zoob> can you paste yours?
[12:09:09] <BillCriswell> gulp.watch(['js/**/*', 'css/**/*']).on('change', function(){ ... });
[12:09:54] <ecky--ptang-zoob> cool cool
[12:10:40] <Vivekananda> hey jquery and everyone
[12:10:50] <Vivekananda> I have a general web dev question. should I ask ?
[12:10:58] <ecky--ptang-zoob> go
[12:11:46] <ecky--ptang-zoob> BillCriswell: won't that refresh the browser?
[12:12:48] <BillCriswell> ecky--ptang-zoob: That's what's happeninig with livereload. It reloads the browser when a file changes.
[12:13:04] <BillCriswell> with CSS it would inject
[12:13:09] <BillCriswell> but with JS it would have to reload.
[12:13:09] <ecky--ptang-zoob> yeah but with css it reloads without reloading the whole page
[12:13:16] <ecky--ptang-zoob> oh
[12:13:25] <ecky--ptang-zoob> it's not possible with js to inject?
[12:14:38] <BillCriswell> ecky--ptang-zoob: Not that I'm aware of.
[12:16:22] <BillCriswell> ecky--ptang-zoob: It looks like there's a "applyJSLive" option for livereload.
[12:16:36] <ecky--ptang-zoob> wow
[12:16:40] <BillCriswell> I can't imagine that going too smoothly. I'm a pessimist though.
[12:17:00] <ecky--ptang-zoob> npm install better-livereload
[12:17:01] <ecky--ptang-zoob> :D
[12:17:05] <ecky--ptang-zoob> *skeptical
[12:17:41] <BillCriswell> Regular livereload has that option too.
[12:19:46] <BillCriswell> CSS I trust reloading in the background, JS definitely not.
[12:37:03] <Snacks> I'm trying to retrieve a value from one column of a table, and duplicate it in another column. But, the header row is getting messed up. Take a look at the following code. See how the header row has an extra column at the end? Any help would be appreciated: http://jsfiddle.net/4c724/1/
[12:38:09] <d0de> how do I convert IPv4 decimal to dot-decimal format?
[12:39:12] <duch_kazatel> d0de huh?
[12:39:37] <Snacks> nevermind, I found my problem
[12:39:48] <duch_kazatel> Snacks what was it?  was just about to look.
[12:40:12] <Snacks> duch_kazatel: the problem is the first row has all TH's, except the last one
[12:40:18] <duch_kazatel> ah, hah
[12:40:38] <Snacks> duch_kazatel: I can't change the code that generates that HTML though. Any ideas on how to solve that?
[12:41:22] <duch_kazatel> Why can't you change it?
[12:41:34] <Snacks> duch_kazatel: I guess I could just do an insert. It's always going to be in the 3rd position
[12:41:35] <d0de> duch_kazatel, nm. figured it out while I was considering how to pose the clarification!
[12:42:01] <duch_kazatel> okay
[12:42:17] <duch_kazatel> Snacks you should really have the output fixed, either way.
[12:43:03] <Snacks> duch_kazatel: I can't. It's delivered, baseline code. It takes an act of congress to get it changed
[12:43:27] <duch_kazatel> Snacks bummer - i'd protest that one big time.
[12:43:32] <duch_kazatel> since it's invalid.
[12:43:51] <Snacks> Oh I have. This companies HTML code is archaic, and full of bugs, but I have to work arpound it
[12:44:22] <duch_kazatel> so glad i can take the time to fix things and to stuff the right way at my company.
[12:45:07] <Snacks> duch_kazatel: When I write the code, it's solid. This is just one of those situations where I can't correct the HTML code. How would I just insert a new TH in column 3?
[12:46:24] <duch_kazatel> $(this).find('th').eq(2)
[12:46:37] <Snacks> duch_kazatel: sorry, actually, it will always be column 2
[12:46:44] <duch_kazatel> ...
[12:46:49] <duch_kazatel> then change the eq
[12:47:44] <duch_kazatel> if you want to insert something into column 2, you can do $(this).find('th').eq(0).after()
[12:47:47] <Snacks> duch_kazatel: well, you can see in my code, I do just that. Look for index 0. But that's causing a problem because of the TD in the header row
[12:48:50] <duch_kazatel> you're going to have to mungle your logic.
[12:48:53] <duch_kazatel> *munge
[12:49:07] <Snacks> yep
[12:49:20] <Snacks> or do something like "where the row number > 0"
[12:49:32] <duch_kazatel> or fix it ahead of time.
[12:49:51] <duch_kazatel> i'd check to see if the current tr has any child th tags and, if so, treat that as a header row.
[12:49:52] <Snacks> but I cant
[12:50:01] <Snacks> hmmm
[12:50:09] <duch_kazatel> and you could "fix" it using js.
[12:50:19] <duch_kazatel> but that's going to require similar logic.
[12:50:25] <Snacks> yeah
[12:50:51] <Snacks> can you help me with the code that says "if this row contains a TH, then ignore it"?
[12:51:12] <duch_kazatel> check out .has()
[12:51:15] <Snacks> k
[12:51:40] <duch_kazatel> you could also check the .length() on the object returned by .children() or .find()
[12:51:42] <BillCriswell> Probably .not() here.
[12:51:59] <BillCriswell> .... maybe.
[12:53:28] <duch_kazatel> this guy
[12:53:47] <dhardison> is there a nifty way to check if an object has a property set like var data = {} if ( data && data.options && data.options.something )
[12:54:07] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: Doesn't work haha
[12:54:11] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell hahaha
[12:54:28] <soresuperstan> if I want to filter returned data from a sql query.. and set it up as "organize by" do I have to create <label> for each returned item and have the data in there.. or is there a different method to filter?
[12:54:47] <duch_kazatel> dhardison define "nifty"
[12:54:51] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: $('tr').not('> th') I thought that would work for some reason.
[12:54:55] <dhardison> fast and short
[12:55:10] <dhardison> duch_kazatel: without typing out some long line of checks..
[12:55:13] <duch_kazatel> dhardison can't have both in this case - you should opt for readable and fast.
[12:55:26] <duch_kazatel> you could do try/catches everywhere instead, but that's hacky and gross.
[12:55:29] <Es0teric> whats the best way to clean up html from a string
[12:55:30] <Es0teric> ?
[12:55:47] <duch_kazatel> Es0teric "clean up"?
[12:55:55] <Es0teric> duch_kazatel: yeah like strip html
[12:55:55] <decx> tds and ths can be mixed in a tr btw, totally valid
[12:56:05] <duch_kazatel> decx sure, but not for their use case.
[12:56:07] <dhardison> duch_kazatel: yeah i don't want to do that, i'll just make a long check.  i didn't know if i overlooked some helper function somewhere
[12:56:19] <duch_kazatel> Es0teric could put that into a fragment and nab the .text() out of it.
[12:56:45] <BillCriswell> $('tr').filter(function () { return $(this).find('th').length === 0; }).addClass('foo');
[12:57:12] <Snacks> duch_kazatel: This is what I came up with. Seems to work, but it's ugly having to call it twice. Look ok? Or can I do it in a single step?
[12:57:13] <Snacks> http://jsfiddle.net/4c724/3/
[12:58:24] <duch_kazatel> Snacks first off, cache selectors: var $myThing = $("table[summary*='list of students registered']").find('tr');
[12:58:38] <duch_kazatel> then run stuff off of $myThing instead.
[12:58:45] <Snacks> k
[12:58:53] <mephx> hey guys. when body's overflow-y is set to scroll, and some other element's overflow-y is set to scroll, when scrolling inside the element is there a way to prevent scrolling the body when start/end scroll of overflown element has been reached? thanks!
[13:00:03] <decx> Snacks http://jsfiddle.net/decx/4c724/4/
[13:00:24] <Snacks> duch_kazatel: Updated: http://jsfiddle.net/4c724/4/
[13:00:33] <Snacks> decx: Thanks. I did similar, but with caching
[13:00:36] <Snacks> see link
[13:00:52] <decx> your's is overly complex
[13:00:54] <decx> yours
[13:00:54] <duch_kazatel> decx's gets you even closer.
[13:01:05] <Snacks> ah, I see that
[13:01:09] <Snacks> ty ty
[13:01:17] <duch_kazatel> his derives context much more sanely.
[13:02:46] <Snacks> ty both. I've got it place, and it's working great.
[13:10:29] <decx> Snacks i guess http://jsfiddle.net/decx/4c724/6/ would make the most sense for maintenance
[13:12:08] <decx> what's with that word maintenance?
[13:12:24] <decx> it isn't 'to mainten' is it
[13:12:53] <BillCriswell> decx: Are you even speaking American right now dude.
[13:13:13] <decx> eh, mon. i speak colourful
[13:13:54] <BillCriswell> There's like a booklet of tags on this tshirt I bought. It's out of control.
[13:14:14] <Snacks> decx: agreed, but I think the first solution is more human readable. They don't hire the 'swooftest' coders around here.
[13:14:33] <decx> less repetition is always good
[13:24:20] <NoiseEee> unless you're in a drone band
[13:27:32] <decx> hah!
[13:41:04] <PantsOfChocolate> anyone here well versed in the google maps api stuff?
[13:42:38] <jParkton> lol
[13:43:40] <PantsOfChocolate> i take your lol as yes i invented it
[13:44:27] <jParkton> nein
[13:46:15] <duch_kazatel> PantsOfChocolate you could always just ask your question and we can try to help.
[13:46:20] <jParkton> I think being well versed in any api can many anything
[13:46:32] <jParkton> mean anything rathere
[14:00:38] <noregret> if, in a <script> tag, there is !function(x){...}(JQuery); - how can I run this function?
[14:00:40] <sweet2k4> guys, i have problem with the fade in function when changing src of an image. i get the the replacement to work but the fadein function dosnt work. dont worry about the hockup becous its auto generated by webdesign software http://codeshare.io/nrUPK
[14:01:39] <duch_kazatel> noregret it runs for you automatically.
[14:01:57] <duch_kazatel> you can't re-run it, if that's what you're asking.
[14:02:19] <blakespot> !spoke decx
[14:03:38] <decx> 35mins 45secs
[14:03:47] <blakespot> :-)
[14:04:26] <decx> watup
[14:04:52] <blakespot> I've been sick sick in bed since our grid talk basicaly -- trying to tweak out the behavior - had a question for you
[14:05:50] <decx> oh that
[14:06:03] <decx> i noticed a bug when i looked over it later that day
[14:06:27] <decx> width for the elements was mixed up
[14:06:52] <decx> i think i based that fiddle, mom
[14:07:10] <decx> right http://jsfiddle.net/decx/fy9mZ/
[14:08:10] <blakespot> hm
[14:12:05] <blakespot> decx: ahh. checking
[14:12:07] <blakespot> nice
[14:12:55] <blakespot> and for non square shapes the rect.left would get the w val and the rect.top would get the h val of the draggable div
[14:13:04] <blakespot> vs 150
[14:14:04] <decx> yeah the two 150s are the dimension of the draggable
[14:14:22] <decx> you can get that beforehand and put it in there as a var
[14:15:37] <blakespot> boom
[14:15:39] <blakespot> that works
[14:15:57] <blakespot> before the draggable shape was not triggering just where it shoul;d
[14:16:10] <blakespot> as if the div were offset from visible
[14:16:14] <blakespot> as far as what triggered
[14:16:17] <blakespot> this works perfectly
[14:17:14] <decx> yeah because i messed up the target width, so it checked as if the draggable had the dimension of a grid element
[14:17:23] <decx> we just didnt notice in the fiddle because they were the same size
[14:19:32] <blakespot> thanks so much for finding, fixing
[14:19:37] <blakespot> I was messing with this for some time
[14:28:09] <blakespot> Is it possible to get jQuery to pixellate an image
[14:28:25] <blakespot> on rollover, etc.
[14:28:30] <blakespot> drag etc
[14:28:53] <jParkton> yes
[14:31:18] <sweet2k4> is there something wrong with this line of code. the replacement works but not the fadein function : $2pack.attr('src', 'images/2-packvit.png').fadeIn();
[14:32:46] <decx> it probably works but you don't notice because the image is being loaded
[14:34:46] <sweet2k4> decx: but the change is made instantly when i click
[14:35:41] <blakespot> decx: I grabbed a plugin for jQ called pixelate
[14:35:48] <blakespot> Here's the syntax: $('img').pixelate();
[14:36:19] <blakespot> I could alter '$(this).addClass('yea') ...
[14:36:40] <blakespot> to run that func - I have an img inside the div your code is acting on
[14:36:41] <HowardwLo> hi guys, need some help figuring out how to have the image scroll up at any point rather than at a fixed point of the text http://jsfiddle.net/ZgX3a/17/
[14:37:03] <blakespot> would that be $(this.img).pixelate(); ?
[14:37:23] <blakespot> Still wet behind ears on jquery struct for parent / child
[14:37:37] <HowardwLo> i got it working on the way down, it position fixed’s itself correctly, but when scrolling up, it currently needs to hit a certain point to scroll the image. I wnat it to scroll the image anytime i scroll up.
[14:38:49] <HowardwLo> would it be best if i went off of the scrool bar?
[14:38:52] <HowardwLo> scroll*
[14:39:17] <HowardwLo> I’m thinking I need to check how the scroll bar is moving or something...
[14:40:42] <HowardwLo> really lost on how to proceed. can anyone offer some advice?
[14:43:49] <HowardwLo> free cookies?
[14:44:08] <duch_kazatel> HowardwLo what are you trying to do exactly?
[14:44:20] <jParkton> I am not understanding
[14:44:28] <HowardwLo> duch_kazatel: i want the images that are bigger than the screen to stay on the screen
[14:44:45] <HowardwLo> http://jsfiddle.net/ZgX3a/17/ works fine when scrolling down
[14:45:05] <HowardwLo> but when i scroll up from the bottom of the document, i have to reach the top to scroll the image back up
[14:45:15] <duch_kazatel> ah, but you want the images to scroll back up when you start scrolling up.
[14:45:22] <HowardwLo> yes!
[14:46:03] <duch_kazatel> first off, cache your selectors OUTSIDE of that scroll binding.
[14:46:03] <jParkton> ie all the images in the div to match the height of the content
[14:46:45] <duch_kazatel> jParkton ignore that part - scroll down, works as expected.  start scrolling up - he wants the images to scroll up at the same time, instead of stay where they are until he hits a certain point.
[14:47:04] <HowardwLo> you’re like a poet
[14:47:16] <jParkton> but for that to happen those images need to be equal to the height of the content?
[14:47:31] <jParkton> so bottom of bottom image === bottom of content?
[14:47:44] <jParkton> and top == content.top
[14:48:34] <decx> blakespot that pixelate.js has built in hover reveal, you don't need that
[14:49:03] <HowardwLo> duch_kazatel: when you say selectors, you mean #image_section and #text_section? I’m pretty new with jQuery so forgive my lack of vocab :D
[14:49:27] <duch_kazatel> yes. those are selectors.  basically, your code reruns a bunch of stuff it doesn't need to.
[14:49:43] <duch_kazatel> var $imageSection = $('#image_section');
[14:50:14] <duch_kazatel> do that before your .on('scroll' stuff, then use $imageSection whenever you're looking to use #image_section.
[14:50:26] <Es0teric> has anyone here used bourbon from boubon.io?
[14:50:53] <HowardwLo> duch_kazatel: http://jsfiddle.net/ZgX3a/19/ righto!
[14:52:16] <blakespot> decx: Hmm, was hoping for a quick and dirty pixellating effect vs. current opacity change
[14:53:01] <blakespot> is there a basic pixellation featuer in jQ?
[14:53:42] <HowardwLo> duch_kazatel: so i was thinking, maybe i need to compare the scroll bar movement to the height of my image or something
[14:54:08] <HowardwLo> duch_kazatel: but i think that is…more complicated than it needs to be
[14:55:01] <duch_kazatel> i don't get what height has to do with any of thigs.
[14:55:02] <duch_kazatel> *this
[14:55:09] <duch_kazatel> you want scrollbar velocity.
[14:56:34] <duch_kazatel> or direction - http://stackoverflow.com/a/4326907/923919
[14:56:37] <HowardwLo> so, which direction and how far the scroll bar is moving
[14:57:13] <HowardwLo> how does that translate into how the image should move?
[14:57:15] <decx> blakespot it's never going to be quick because you always have to generate canvases for every image
[14:57:23] <decx> would be faster to do the whole thing in one canvas
[14:57:33] <duch_kazatel> HowardwLo you have different logic to run when scrolling up vs. down.
[14:58:39] <blakespot> hmm
[14:58:56] <blakespot> Other thought is to overlay two images, one pixellated, in the same space and change opacity
[14:59:11] <blakespot> Just FWIW, FYI sending you the QA site in DM now
[14:59:16] <HowardwLo> duch_kazatel: im a bit lost as to what the logic should be
[14:59:32] <duch_kazatel> HowardwLo when scrolling down: one set of if checks.
[14:59:40] <duch_kazatel> when scrolling up, another set of if checks.
[14:59:51] <decx> blakespot that would be the easiest approach
[15:00:00] <blakespot> yea - was orig plan
[15:00:39] <HowardwLo> duch_kazatel: if its not about the height, what does the if check for?
[15:01:04] <duch_kazatel> well, not the height of the images.
[15:01:12] <duch_kazatel> that's an initial check, but you're not resizing things.
[15:01:37] <decx> blakespot for posterity http://jsfiddle.net/decx/fy9mZ/6/
[15:02:23] <decx> i butchered pixelate.js for it but whatever ^^
[15:03:03] <decx> it's always going to be, create canvas, get image src, resize to small, resize to big with imagesmoothingenabled false, append canvas after img
[15:03:16] <decx> and then the rest with css
[15:03:40] <blakespot> ah nice
[15:03:59] <duch_kazatel> that's a novel way to blur an image.
[15:04:09] <HowardwLo> duch_kazatel: im not understanding. I followed an example on stackoverflow to get the height jsfiddle i showed oyu earlier
[15:04:14] <blakespot> very nice
[15:04:26] <HowardwLo> i guess im having trouble visualizing what is suppose to be happening
[15:04:28] <duch_kazatel> HowardwLo you're getting caught up on an irrelevant detail..
[15:04:43] <decx> well bluring would be easier thanks to webkits blur and svg filters ^^
[15:05:50] <duch_kazatel> HowardwLo ignore the size thing for a second.
[15:05:50] <duch_kazatel> think about how your logic falls apart when you're scrolling up.
[15:06:07] <HowardwLo> duch_kazatel: right, it requires the hieght of the image to be less than windowposition
[15:06:28] <blakespot> is imgWidth/Height the orig size of the cat image?
[15:06:32] <blakespot> 200
[15:06:52] <decx> yeah i ripped all the options out
[15:06:58] <decx> you can pass dimen as an argument
[15:07:19] <duch_kazatel> HowardwLo right - now how does that fall apart when scrolling up?
[15:07:58] <HowardwLo> duch_kazatel: i need to reach a certain height
[15:08:09] <duch_kazatel> HowardwLo vertical offset.
[15:10:44] <HowardwLo> duch_kazatel: so if im scrolling down, and its fixed top, i need to remove that until the image hits the bottom
[15:11:11] <HowardwLo> and if im scrolling up, it needs to remove fixed until it hits the top and applies fixedtop
[15:11:27] <blakespot> decx: Thanks again -
[15:11:33] <HowardwLo> i think...
[15:11:38] <blakespot> Last Q - is there a courseness setting in here?
[15:11:44] <blakespot> degree of pixellization
[15:11:45] <blakespot> etc.
[15:14:21] <HowardwLo> duch_kazatel: a hint to what goes into the if check when scrolling down?
[15:14:46] <duch_kazatel> HowardwLo you all ready have the scrolling down logic.
[15:14:50] <duch_kazatel> you need the scrolling up part.
[15:15:24] <duch_kazatel> i'd show you but i'm lazy and busy
[15:15:51] <HowardwLo> ack hmmm
[15:16:50] <duch_kazatel> also - I wouldn't check the heights of things still - i'd look at the vertical offset of things instead.
[15:16:56] <duch_kazatel> the top and bottoms of them.
[15:20:58] <HowardwLo> duch_kazatel: bottom vertical offset is just vertical offset + height right?
[15:21:13] <duch_kazatel> the bottom of an element you mean, and sure.
[15:21:37] <HowardwLo> is that what you meant by bottom of things?
[15:22:03] <duch_kazatel> yes. - i'm trying to get you to frame the problem differently in your head.
[15:23:11] <w00tb3ast> Quick question: I have a div with a bunch of div tiles in them, is it possible to create a simple "masonry" style layout using only floats?
[15:23:30] <duch_kazatel> w00tb3ast not without masonry
[15:23:50] <bongjovi> w00tb3ast, no, there are css methods but they're pretty hacky
[15:23:55] <bongjovi> wouldn't recommend
[15:23:59] <bongjovi> using columns
[15:24:08] <decx> blakespot http://jsfiddle.net/decx/fy9mZ/7/
[15:24:13] <duch_kazatel> you can do https://jira.impdir.com/browse/IDS-11650
[15:24:15] <duch_kazatel> woops.
[15:24:19] <duch_kazatel> https://github.com/dmdez/simple-masonry
[15:25:50] <w00tb3ast> I am just floating elements which are already 50% wide either left or right based off their outer height but occasionally when an element is taller than one either side of it the wrong float is being applied
[15:26:01] <HowardwLo> duch_kazatel: im stuck trying to figure out how to not use height
[15:26:15] <w00tb3ast> I guess I need to figure out which is the tallest and float it one way then everything else the other
[15:26:17] <HowardwLo> dont i need to know how tall the image is?
[15:26:20] <duch_kazatel> HowardwLo you DO use height you get the offset of the buttom of things.
[15:26:52] <duch_kazatel> w00tb3ast just use the github repo i linked.
[15:27:01] <w00tb3ast> Yeah I will give it a go
[15:27:28] <duch_kazatel> HowardwLo thing about it in terms of action -> test
[15:27:39] <duch_kazatel> what do you test when scrolling down vs. what do you test when scrolling up.
[15:27:55] <duch_kazatel> protip: the answer is found by stepping through it.
[15:28:40] <bongjovi> w00tb3ast, out of interest, howcome you can't use masonry?
[15:28:53] <w00tb3ast> it's being VERY buggy
[15:29:06] <w00tb3ast> and all my elements are the same width I have no complex layout
[15:29:23] <w00tb3ast> literally just 2 columns of the same  elastic width where each tile is a different height
[15:30:06] <bongjovi> hmm, what kind of problems are you having? I haven't used the repo duch_kazatel linked to but if that doesn't work I might be able to help with masonry
[15:30:29] <fonsA2> Hi. I'm trying to get .hide() to work inside a modal (simplemodal) but it doesn't hide it for some reason. The hide fires outside the modal though. See here for the example outside the modal: http://jsfiddle.net/RKTU7/
[15:30:40] <fonsA2> Any clue why that might be?
[15:30:56] <w00tb3ast> initial load the elements overlap, window resizing corrects that but sometimes after the window is resized they overlap again or sit in the overflow of their parent container
[15:31:11] <duch_kazatel> you could display: block; each element, enumerate through each to see which one goes over your specified height, then grab that and the rest of siblings that come after and put those into the other column.
[15:31:59] <duch_kazatel> fonsA2 are you just trying to hide the form?
[15:32:06] <HowardwLo> duch_kazatel: http://jsfiddle.net/ZgX3a/20/
[15:32:18] <fonsA2> Yes inside a function but it's not firing when inside a modal.
[15:32:20] <HowardwLo> duch_kazatel: the only thing is, it snaps now
[15:32:23] <fonsA2> outside it works.
[15:32:30] <duch_kazatel> fonsA2 first of all, you want the submit event of the form.
[15:33:17] <fonsA2> Yes. I have the hide function firing off on successful submit.
[15:33:27] <fonsA2> I did an alert and it pops
[15:33:29] <fonsA2> but doesnt hide
[15:33:29] <bongjovi> w00tb3ast, sounds strange, is there anything particularly unusual about your layout?
[15:33:33] <bongjovi> Are the items images?
[15:33:40] <bongjovi> Maybe need to use imagesLoaded?
[15:34:07] <w00tb3ast> images and text, imagesloaded doesn't matter either, when the browser is just being resized the images have all already loaded
[15:35:07] <duch_kazatel> fonsA2 jsfiddle.net/RKTU7/1/
[15:35:09] <duch_kazatel> works here.
[15:35:37] <fonsA2> @duch. Yes outside the modal it works
[15:35:42] <fonsA2> which that example is.
[15:35:51] <bongjovi> w00tb3ast, true, that sounds really strange
[15:35:54] <fonsA2> but when inside a modal it doesnt work
[15:36:01] <w00tb3ast> bongjovi it is haha
[15:36:16] <duch_kazatel> fonsA2 something tells me the modal plugin creates the HTML or otherwise clones it.
[15:36:24] <duch_kazatel> one sec.
[15:36:27] <w00tb3ast> anyway it should be possible to achieve a similar layout and not have to deal with clearing issues if elements are floated to the opposite sides
[15:37:09] <fonsA2> @duch - Yes. I'm guessing it's targeting the hidden div which the modal is displaying.
[15:37:13] <duch_kazatel> try something like this, fonsA2 http://jsfiddle.net/RKTU7/2/
[15:37:19] <fonsA2> instead of the modal.
[15:37:37] <duch_kazatel> non - it's trying to bind to something that doesn't yet exist.
[15:39:21] <fonsA2> @duch - Here is a copy of the function being used on the site: http://jsfiddle.net/9LL46/
[15:39:57] <duch_kazatel> fonsA2 btw drop the @ and use my full handle.  most peoples IRC clients will notify them when their name is mentioned.
[15:40:11] <fonsA2> Oh sorry.
[15:40:15] <duch_kazatel> did you try the thing I just posted?
[15:40:22] <duch_kazatel> the delegated binding?
[15:40:23] <fonsA2> Giving it a shot right now.
[15:40:25] <fonsA2> one sec
[15:40:57] <duch_kazatel> what's with the setTimeout() ?
[15:41:12] <fonsA2> Just to create a loading effect.
[15:41:15] <duch_kazatel> are you trying to hide/close stuff after the post has finishes?
[15:41:59] <fonsA2> No. It's just to create an illusion that something is loading.
[15:42:04] <HowardwLo> duch_kazatel: should i be setting a new offset everytime i scroll up?
[15:42:41] <duch_kazatel> HowardwLo you'll need the new offset of the window.  might need the offset of that image thinger, too, in relation
[15:43:00] <duch_kazatel> fonsA2 that... doesn't make any sense, but okay.
[15:43:34] <voronika> fonsA2: what happens when you set the class or id  of your modal in $( "#signup-form" ).hide(... rather than the #signup-form id?
[15:45:01] <HowardwLo> duch_kazatel: yup im fully lost now :D
[15:45:58] <duch_kazatel> var offsetofimagebottom = offsetofimagetop + $('#image_section').height(); :(
[15:46:13] <duch_kazatel> return types yo
[15:46:14] <fonsA2> duch the delegated binding code didn't work.
[15:46:30] <HowardwLo> what?
[15:46:39] <duch_kazatel> fonsA2 then i'd need to see it with the modal code in action.
[15:46:42] <duch_kazatel> HowardwLo one sec.
[15:48:01] <fonsA2> @duch: http://development.jobjogger.com/
[15:48:09] <fonsA2> form portion should hide upon successful submission
[15:48:15] <fonsA2> whoops
[15:48:19] <fonsA2> sorry about using at
[15:48:21] <fonsA2> it's a habit
[15:48:35] <duch_kazatel> IRC isn't twitter ;)
[15:48:45] <duch_kazatel> can you set up the modal on the fiddle instead?
[15:49:01] <fonsA2> Sure. Give me one sec.
[15:50:00] <HowardwLo> http://jsfiddle.net/ZgX3a/22/    i need to set a new offset right? no?
[15:50:28] <duch_kazatel> HowardwLo i told you'm i'm lazy, but one sec and i'll show you what I mean.
[15:50:49] <HowardwLo> duch_kazatel: oh, thanks man. sorry :)
[15:52:26] <fonsA2> Does "$(document).ready(function ()" work on jfiddle?
[15:55:00] <duch_kazatel> HowardwLo first off, http://jsfiddle.net/ZgX3a/23/ this is what i meant with my caching remark hearlier.
[15:55:01] <duch_kazatel> *hearlier
[15:55:09] <duch_kazatel> fff you know what i meant :)
[15:56:19] <HowardwLo> duch_kazatel: right ok
[15:56:24] <fonsA2> Here you go duch: http://jsfiddle.net/9LL46/
[15:57:48] <duch_kazatel> HowardwLo http://jsfiddle.net/ZgX3a/24/
[15:57:50] <duch_kazatel> start here.
[15:58:03] <duch_kazatel> fonsA2 that's... not what I was looking for.
[15:58:19] <fonsA2> what were you looking for?
[15:58:26] <duch_kazatel> a functioning example with the modal.
[15:58:53] <HowardwLo> duch_kazatel: wait so, was my other code incorrect?
[15:59:04] <HowardwLo> http://jsfiddle.net/ZgX3a/22/
[15:59:12] <HowardwLo> erm
[15:59:14] <duch_kazatel> i give up.
[15:59:22] <duch_kazatel> i'm not going to do it for you.
[15:59:29] <duch_kazatel> i'm trying to point you in a direction duder.
[16:01:18] <fonsA2> Me or Howard...or both?
[16:01:19] <fonsA2> haha
[16:01:24] <duch_kazatel> howard
[16:01:55] <HowardwLo> i was trying to follow it, and in 22 i thought i got pretty close, but you said my caching was poor and reverted back to the old code i had
[16:02:06] <HowardwLo> im just asking if what i did for 22 was wrong
[16:02:43] <duch_kazatel> obviously it is because it doesn't work ;)
[16:02:58] <duch_kazatel> you're convoluting concepts in your head.
[16:05:12] <duch_kazatel> if you don't mind my asking, where did you get the design idea for this?
[16:05:19] <duch_kazatel> it seems strange to me.
[16:05:57] <HowardwLo> i dont know, i just thought it would make more sense if i wanted to see the top of the image
[16:06:05] <HowardwLo> on a long wall of text, i wouldnt have to scroll all the way up
[16:06:43] <HowardwLo> its a quality of life thing i guess, but im drawing a blank
[16:06:55] <duch_kazatel> i'd separate things out a little further then,.'
[16:08:26] <duch_kazatel> either way, you don't actually want to use position: fixed on any of this.  you need to manually set the top/bottom in relation ot the viewport.  but the design idea is really strange, so I'd reconsider what you're doing in the first place
[16:08:32] <duch_kazatel> but maybe somebody else has a better idea.
[16:10:18] <fonsA2> duch. here you go: http://development.jobjogger.com/modal.html
[16:10:27] <fonsA2> modal script found in custom.js
[16:11:19] <fonsA2> and the simplemodal script is actually embeded in a pop script "PopBannerLoader.js". I know...it's not my site or idea
[16:11:21] <duch_kazatel> i'm not going to copy/paste for you to jsfiddle......
[16:11:39] <fonsA2> okay. ill transfer it
[16:11:40] <fonsA2> one sec
[16:12:04] <HowardwLo> thanks for your help duch
[16:16:30] <duch_kazatel> this adjector thing is weird.
[16:16:47] <duch_kazatel> something tells me that's where part of your problem lies fonsA2
[16:18:31] <fonsA2> Yes. I've figured that out long time ago but my client insists on using it.
[16:18:45] <fonsA2> I actually had bootstrap modal in place but had to drop it because of that script
[16:19:16] <FarLight> Can you get rid of your client?
[16:20:31] <fonsA2> FarLight...mmmm...no
[16:20:34] <fonsA2> ha
[16:22:08] <fonsA2> Duch. Tried to get it to work in JFiddle but can't seem to get it working. All External Resources are included. http://jsfiddle.net/GALLt/1/
[16:22:17] <duch_kazatel> duch_kazatel, you mean ;)
[16:22:40] <duch_kazatel> and that adjector thing sounds like a big part of the problem.
[16:22:42] <duch_kazatel> no idea mang.
[16:22:42] <fonsA2> Sure...Master Duch Kazatel.
[16:22:47] <duch_kazatel> not about "
[16:22:48] <fonsA2> ha
[16:23:03] <duch_kazatel> *master, dude, reread the whole client notification thing i said earlier.
[16:23:35] <patricka_> does anyone have a favorite replacement for the Jquery ui range slider... its the only part of jquery ui i am still using... http://jqueryui.com/slider/#range
[16:23:37] <fonsA2> I thought you said drop the "at"
[16:23:53] <fonsA2> It
[16:24:04] <duch_kazatel> "fonsA2 btw drop the @ and use my full handle.  most peoples IRC clients will notify them when their name is mentioned."
[16:24:23] <duch_kazatel> patricka_ I've used http://refreshless.com/nouislider/ a few times.
[16:24:48] <fonsA2> It's all good. It would have been nice to get the hide form to work but its functional. thanks for the help
[16:24:58] <duch_kazatel> sorry duder.
[16:25:38] <patricka_> duch_kazatel: thanks happen to know of a vanilla js one?
[16:26:44] <duch_kazatel> patricka_ nope.
[16:30:22] <duch_kazatel> patricka_ are you abating jquery out of your codebase, too?
[16:30:44] <patricka_> duch_kazatel: yeah looking into options
[16:31:06] <duch_kazatel> http://andreruffert.github.io/rangeslider.js/
[16:31:11] <duch_kazatel> could start here.
[16:31:17] <duch_kazatel> why are you getting rid of jquery?
[16:35:37] <patricka_> duch_kazatel: browser support needs are pretty minimal on some projects now looking to see if i can just reduce the complexity and codebase
[16:37:21] <duch_kazatel> patricka_ i'd
[16:37:28] <duch_kazatel> *i'd still kepe jquery around, but that's me.
[16:37:44] <FarLight> so says the dude hanging out in #jquery lol
[16:37:58] <duch_kazatel> it's great for a lot of things.
[16:38:41] <FarLight> Can it bring you true happiness?
[16:38:48] <chriys> sup guys
[16:38:56] <duch_kazatel> nah, but it makes my life a helluva lot easier.
[16:39:11] <duch_kazatel> https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/324283889/potato-salad :(
[16:39:16] <FarLight> hello chriys
[16:39:33] <chriys> does someone knows how to apply this filter on the background image? http://www.lequipe.fr/Football/Coupe-du-monde/Mundial-Memories/
[16:39:43] <chriys> how you doing FarLight ?
[16:39:52] <FarLight> duch_kazatel: haha thats amazing
[16:40:19] <Xliff> duch_kazatel: WTF?
[16:40:26] <Xliff> $16k for POTATO SALAD?
[16:40:45] <FarLight> Not bad chriys
[16:40:59] <jphase> hehe, this is kinda neat:  http://codepen.io/noahblon/pen/CsxfH
[16:40:59] <duch_kazatel> chriys looka gain - that's not a filter on an image.
[16:42:06] <chriys> what I'm actually wondering is how they did apply the kind of grid on the image
[16:42:11] * Xliff has been spending the last few days learning Angular.js
[16:42:38] <duch_kazatel> chriys maybe i'm misunderstanding - which filter are you talking about?
[16:44:05] <FarLight> http://www.lequipe.fr/Football/Coupe-du-monde/Mundial-Memories/css/images/home-pattern.png
[16:44:27] <chriys> duch_kazatel: On the background image there's grid but this grid is applied by the website the source image doesn't contain the grid
[16:44:38] <decx> it's 2 backgrounds
[16:44:55] <FarLight> <div class="exploit" data-src="images/matchs/1986/highlight/86_maroc_portugal.jpg" style="background-image: url(http://www.lequipe.fr/Football/Coupe-du-monde/Mundial-Memories/css/images/home-pattern.png), url(http://www.lequipe.fr/Football/Coupe-du-monde/Mundial-Memories/images/matchs/1986/highlight/86_maroc_portugal.jpg);">
[16:47:11] <chriys> decx FarLight  I'm talking about the grid how they did to apply the grid on the images. because there's no grid from the images sources
[16:47:23] <duch_kazatel> css probably.
[16:47:43] <decx> it's 2 backgrounds
[16:47:51] <FarLight> I just pasted the div in question to you chriys
[16:48:00] <FarLight> there is a grid in the image sources
[16:48:11] <FarLight> http://www.lequipe.fr/Football/Coupe-du-monde/Mundial-Memories/css/images/home-pattern.png
[16:48:32] <decx> background: url(pattern.png) repeat, url(bigimage.jpg) no-repeat center center
[16:48:49] <FarLight> exactly
[16:50:09] <chriys> Ok I see let me check if I can dowload the image cause I the don't see it
[16:50:55] <FarLight> its very small, its tiled chriys
[16:51:28] <chriys> you're absolutely right
[16:52:33] <FarLight> as usual
[16:52:39] * FarLight slinks back in chair smugly 
[16:52:46] <duch_kazatel> nothing new going on in here today
[17:07:25] <il_> why do $(el).click(myfunc); and $(el).click(function(){myfunc();}); behave differently?
[17:10:22] <sacho> because the way myfunc is invoked is different.
[17:11:45] <sacho> jquery will call the callback with `this` bound to the element - in the second case, your callback is the anonymous function, which just straight up calls myfunc() - this binds `this` to `window`.
[17:12:06] <sacho> see /msg ecmabot this
[17:13:19] <duch_kazatel> we don't have an ecmabot here.
[17:13:33] <sacho> I'm aware
[17:13:55] <FarLight> But are you self aware?
[17:38:19] <pragma-> FarLight: Can you prove that you are?
[17:38:45] * FarLight proves that he is.
[17:39:09] <FarLight> Philosophy isn't all that tricky pragma-
[17:44:27] <pragma-> I think therefore I am.  But I don't know if you are.
[17:44:54] * pragma- pokes at FarLight with a stick.
[17:45:28] <pragma-> You are probably just a figment of my imagination.
[17:46:06] <FarLight> Yes, you're probably right.
[17:46:11] <FarLight> But what a figment!
[17:46:25] <pragma-> Well, you don't have boobs.
[17:46:45] <FarLight> Not yet
[17:47:08] <pragma-> Have some more pudding.
[17:49:06] <FarLight> By summer I'
[17:49:12] <FarLight> ll be ready for a bathing suit
[17:49:34] <PantsOfChocolate> kinda late for that
[17:49:54] <FarLight> Not down unda'
[17:51:51] <Horacsio> Hi I have to restore a sql but the db differs in two things: dbname and username do you think I will have problems regarding these diferences?
[17:52:07] <FarLight> well you came to the right place
[17:52:16] <pragma-> "restore a sql"
[17:52:25] * pragma- goes back to lurking.
[17:52:40] <FarLight> lol
[17:52:48] <duch_kazatel> Horacsio do what now.
[17:53:02] <duch_kazatel> might want to go to a channel about that DB.
[17:53:49] <FarLight> $("#database").restoreSQL({ignoreCredentials: true});
[17:53:53] <duch_kazatel> lol
[17:55:21] <Shaggy_> the powaz of jquery expand far beyond the client :)
[18:19:59] <Yahkob> anyway to add a pseudoclass to a css class on an event?
[18:20:00] <Yahkob> http://jsbin.com/sebafoci/1/edit
[18:20:47] <Yahkob> In this case can I toggle the active pseudo class on the element?
[18:22:18] <chriys_> FarLight thx for your help
[18:25:10] <FarLight> no problem friend
[18:28:35] <DesignerX> ##seo
[18:31:59] <Yahkob> Anyone know if thats possible?
[18:32:39] <FarLight> If what's possible?
[18:34:46] <Yahkob> Toggling a pseudoclass on a selected class FarLight
[18:34:51] <Yahkob> http://jsbin.com/sebafoci/1/edit
[18:35:07] <Yahkob> without a click I'm not sure how they set active
[18:36:07] <FarLight> Ooh, why would you want to do that?
[18:38:19] <BillCriswell> Yahkob: Not sure if you can trigger the :active pseudo class but if you could just add an .active class you can do this: http://jsbin.com/sebafoci/2/edit?html,js,output
[18:38:27] <FarLight> I don't think you can, and even if you could It isn't semantic to modify pseudo classes
[18:38:54] <Yahkob> heh yeah
[18:39:06] <Yahkob> I just don't want to have two of the exact same classes I guess
[18:39:11] <Yahkob> but there is no way around it
[18:39:26] <Yahkob> Its a piano and clicking it sets active so i have that :active pseudo
[18:39:36] <Yahkob> but Im just going to copy it and make a keydown active class :\
[18:40:05] <BillCriswell> Word.
[18:42:58] <HowardwLo> http://jsfiddle.net/ZgX3a/25/ I’m trying to have the image scroll up right when i start scrolling up on the text. How do you achieve a smooth transition from fixed —> not fixed position without jumping?
[18:46:45] <FarLight> HowardwLo: You mean if you are say, halfway down the text, and you start scrolling up, you want the images to scroll up?
[18:47:12] <HowardwLo> FarLight: yes, right as i start scrolling up instead of having it scroll up when it hits a certain point as it is now
[18:48:58] <HowardwLo> im trying to figure out how to transition from a fixed position to a non fixed position without spazzing out and in the least glitchy way possible
[18:51:54] <FarLight> in your code, the condition "if (windowposition > lastScrollTop) {"
[18:51:57] <FarLight> is met no matter what
[18:51:59] <benlieb> most modern frameworks like to include as much app JS in one file as possible. This requires some kind of "check" for which page needs to activate what JS. Does jQ support a structure like this or should I roll my own?
[18:52:14] <benlieb> Currently I'm doing $(document).ready(function(){ if $(body).hasClass('lessons search') { ... } });
[18:52:25] <benlieb> the body tag has classes for controller and action
[18:52:34] <benlieb> is this a hack and is there a better way?
[18:54:02] <FarLight> HowardwLo: You are setting lastScrollTop = windowPosition;
[18:54:15] <FarLight> but windowPosition isn't defined
[18:54:26] <HowardwLo> FarLight: ohhhh
[18:54:57] <HowardwLo> right, oops
[18:56:01] <HowardwLo> ctrl z’d too far
[18:56:15] <FarLight> thats cool was just confusing me
[18:56:51] <HowardwLo> but right, on the upscroll part, im guessing the image needs to unfix itself, then change offset based on how its being scrolled
[18:57:21] <FarLight> yeah that would suit it
[18:58:19] <FarLight> But I guess if I were doing it, I would prefer to just make it always fixed.
[18:58:36] <FarLight> Then change the top value relative to how far the user had scrolled each time
[18:58:57] <FarLight> with the boundary values being the top and bottom of the imagesection
[19:00:19] <HowardwLo> is that hacky?
[19:09:28] <FarLight> I'm sorry HowardwLo  I need to go before I coould get a good jsfiddle working
[19:09:56] <FarLight> but maybe you're right it might be hacky, your version at least avoids the need to update the image sections top value every time it scrolls
[19:10:00] <HowardwLo> FarLight: oh no problem, do you mind showing me what you have?
[19:10:04] <FarLight> sure
[19:11:01] <FarLight> http://jsfiddle.net/ZgX3a/26/
[19:11:38] <FarLight> You could then just check if the newTop value is < 0 or greater than the height of the window and height of the image section
[19:11:42] <FarLight> but again I dont know if thats the best solutin
[19:11:45] <FarLight> sorry dude
[19:18:21] <HowardwLo> FarLight: np! thanks for helping
