[00:00:03] <coldhead> pilgo: it definitely works, you must be doing something wrong
[00:00:07] <coldhead> ?p @ pilgo
[00:00:07] <bot-t> pilgo, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js or http://fixee.org/
[00:04:19] <coldhead> darius_w: http://jsfiddle.net/He6fa/
[00:04:44] <pilgo> coldhead: Here's the code: http://jsfiddle.net/B38JC/1/  if you click "vote up" it'll run the ajax then if you click "vote down" it won't do an ajax request
[00:04:49] <pilgo> and vice-versa
[00:06:50] <coldhead> pilgo: does this work? http://jsfiddle.net/B38JC/2/
[00:07:16] <pilgo> coldhead: No, same behaviour
[00:09:11] <darius_w> coldhead: thank you very mutch
[00:12:59] <DanAKAHollywood> Has anyone here ever working with ckeditor + jquery adapter?
[00:13:05] <DanAKAHollywood> worked with*
[00:14:09] <Edler> yeah
[00:14:12] <Edler> what's up with that ?
[00:14:36] <etcetera_> what would be a quick and easy hack for a simple utility app you'd like to see on Mac?
[00:22:25] <darius_w> how can i call function that i am in? for recursion for example.. ?
[00:23:23] <jomofcw> Hello =)
[00:23:52] <jomofcw> darius_w you can't do it if your function is an anonyme one
[00:23:56] <jomofcw> anonymous
[00:24:02] <jomofcw> according me ^^
[00:25:25] <darius_w> now i do it like: this.myMethod(); but i would like to skip name as i call the function i am in..
[00:26:17] <coldhead> pilgo: i would do it more like this http://jsfiddle.net/B38JC/7/
[00:26:34] <coldhead> but i can't test that because the AJAX isn't working on jsfiddle
[00:27:08] <Hierofant> <embed> won't validate hmmm
[00:27:11] <coldhead> oh and i accidentally nuked the bit where you set var  id; //oops
[00:27:24] <Floss> darius_w, just call myMethod(); from within the method making sure you have a loop exit/switch
[00:29:12] <Floss> darius_w see;http://javascript.about.com/library/blrecursive.htm
[00:31:50] <Hierofant> damn I cannot figure this out
[00:32:10] <Hierofant> I've commented everything and the comments behave like the script is being run
[00:32:28] <Hierofant> but it's doing th ewrong thing
[00:34:31] <cirwin> Why: jQuery('<div>').html('<a href="#"><a href="#"></a></a>').html() === '<a href="#"></a><a href="#"></a>'
[00:34:35] <cirwin> ?
[00:37:02] <xec> cirwin: because .html() returns innerHTML, of the object returned
[00:37:50] <xec> cirwin:  jQuery('<div>').html() == ""
[00:38:01] <cirwin> it changes the ordering of my <a> tags
[00:38:20] <cirwin> from <a><a></a></a> to <a></a><a></a>
[00:38:25] <xec> oh, didnt notice that
[00:38:26] <xec> well
[00:38:32] <xec> you cant nest anchors
[00:38:52] <cirwin> works elsewhere for me :p
[00:39:01] <cirwin> is it the browser doing that then/
[00:39:08] <xec> its not legal html, my guess is jQuery is being nice
[00:46:04] <Hierofant> weird.
[00:46:07] <Hierofant> well I fixed it.
[00:48:20] <ZeuZ> I've got a button wich is linked to click with .live() because it's obtained from a AJAX request. However, if I later make another AJAX request, and go back to the one that brings the button, it is not linked to the click event anymore.. Why's that? For seeing what I mean: http://190.16.98.253/index_nuevo.php
[00:48:53] <ZeuZ> Login works, you can test it with test:test, however if you change clicking on the bottom to anything else (like "contactarme") it stops working
[00:49:32] <ZeuZ> let me rephrase that, if login fails (wrong username/password) and I hit the go back button, then it stops working
[00:50:03] <ZeuZ> Or the other condition as well hehe
[00:51:45] <ZeuZ> Any ideas?
[00:53:11] <Lunders> morning guys, im just having a bit of a problem with using a few plugin's here :( wot im trying to do is when u Submit the form it validated itself, popup's asking for staff id then submit the form .... but for some reason if I use form.submit, it loops into itsself http://jsfiddle.net/CRCRN/
[00:55:20] <Alexer> Hierofant, see? indenting always helps! ;)
[00:55:30] <Hierofant> Alexer hehehe
[00:55:38] <Hierofant> well in my case it wasn't indenting, but yes

[01:13:17] <creage> I have old-school menu, which has view- and disabled- validator, which were called on each menu render
[01:13:50] <creage> now I'm switching for office-like ribbon, where all of menus get displayed once and forever, so there would not be any re-renderings
[01:14:06] <creage> how do I implement old validators so they are compatible with ribbon?

[01:30:58] <SargoDarya_> Hey guys, I have a problem when trying to use jQuery UI tabs with an AJAX call. It seems to strip out my javascript from the AJAX page so it won't render correctly. Any hints to fix this?
[01:31:56] <Lunders> anyone able to help me?
[01:34:03] <SargoDarya_> What's your prob lunders?
[01:37:48] <zangetsu> hello
[01:39:11] <coldhead> bot-t: tell pilgo seriously you are so welcome, i can't even begin to tell you
[01:39:12] <bot-t> coldhead, Okay.
[01:39:18] <simenbrekken> I'm trying to post application/json via $.ajax, but my data payload keeps getting encoded as form-data, any clues on how I can prevent this?
[01:41:28] <Lunders> SargoDarya_: the code above... when you click "submit" it should either prompt you to enter your Staff ID or tell you that you have not filled in the form correctly
[01:41:36] <_ramo> is this: jQuery(function() {  similar to jQuery(document).ready or .load ?
[01:41:52] <Lunders> if you have entered it fine and entered your staff ID and clicked Save.. the form should then submit
[01:41:59] <coldhead> yes _ramo but ues the second form, the .ready()
[01:42:10] <coldhead> it's more readable
[01:42:25] <_ramo> coldhead: but there should be a difference between .load and .ready
[01:42:27] <SargoDarya_> Lunders, I just joined after you posted it possibly
[01:42:34] <SargoDarya_> so pastebin link please ;)
[01:42:45] <coldhead> there is a difference, the thing you have is equivalent to ready()
[01:43:03] <Lunders> SargoDarya_ morning guys, im just having a bit of a problem with using a few plugin's here :( wot im trying to do is when u Submit the form it validated itself, popup's asking for staff id then submit the form .... but for some reason if I use form.submit, it loops into itsself http://jsfiddle.net/CRCRN/
[01:43:15] <_ramo> coldhead: thank you
[01:43:33] <coldhead> ?p @ simenbrekken
[01:43:33] <bot-t> simenbrekken, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js or http://fixee.org/
[01:43:40] <coldhead> show us what you got already?
[01:44:54] <simenbrekken> coldhead: I think I misunderstood the dataType parameter, it's obviously for the return data but it seems I have to serialize my payload manually
[01:45:11] <Lundy> SargoDarya_: what u think?
[01:45:23] <SargoDarya_> Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token }
[01:45:31] <simenbrekken> coldhead: don't know if this is the way to do it: http://paste.pocoo.org/show/397548/
[01:45:32] <coldhead> simenbrekken: you know about serialize() right?
[01:45:34] <Saiko> im using jscrollpane, how can I have the scroll bar have only a height of 10px but still move all the way up and down the scrollbar?
[01:45:38] <simenbrekken> coldhead: I don't, will check
[01:45:45] <coldhead> ?serialize
[01:45:45] <bot-t> .serialize(): Encode a set of form elements as a string for submission. http://api.jquery.com/serialize/
[01:45:51] <simenbrekken> coldhead: I don't want form-data encoding
[01:46:10] <coldhead> you want to send JSON?
[01:46:12] <simenbrekken> Yeah
[01:46:26] <simenbrekken> coldhead: I don't see the point of sending data=<json> rather than just sending the JSON as the body of the request
[01:46:42] <simenbrekken> This works now btw, was just wondering if there was a "better" way
[01:47:01] <Lundy> SargoDarya_: http://lundy.me.uk/GFA/add_customer.php?t=67466109ab53a17a111103b0551dc01a&s=1
[01:47:04] <toxz> i have events on radio buttons. i dont want the action to be fired, if the radio is allready selected... any ideas?
[01:47:10] <coldhead> simenbrekken: i guess the point is that that's how most of the web does it :\
[01:47:26] <toxz> because in the click action this.val() is always "on"
[01:47:34] <simenbrekken> coldhead: maybe because 9/10 people don't have a clue what actually happens in an HTTP request
[01:47:49] <coldhead> i am one of those 9
[01:48:10] <coldhead> most jQuery is gonna look like http://paste.pocoo.org/show/397551/
[01:48:30] <coldhead> and if it doesn't i would suddenly have many questions about exactly what was going on on the server side
[01:48:49] <coldhead> and i might need a little drinkie-poohs
[01:48:53] <coldhead> speaking of which!
[01:49:08] <beevi7> guys, i need help with a native xmlhttprequest
[01:49:17] <beevi7> i have to 98% identical files
[01:49:30] <coldhead> beevi7: does your question have anything to do with jQiery?
[01:49:31] <SargoDarya_> Lundy, not really a clue whats happening :/
[01:49:33] <coldhead> jQUery*
[01:49:55] <beevi7> yes. i'm looking for a way to solve my problem using jquery ;)
[01:50:02] <coldhead> proceed :)
[01:50:06] <Lundy> SargoDarya_: ??
[01:50:23] <dragoonis> \o/ coldhead
[01:50:34] <beevi7> i'm currently using xhr.open("POST", path, true);
[01:50:35] <SargoDarya_> I mean, what exactly is your problem on that site?
[01:50:48] <seutje> I broketh my npm :(
[01:51:05] <beevi7> now I was trying to use $.ajax({url: path, type: "POST"});
[01:51:08] <coldhead> MAYBE SOMEONE IN -OT COULD HELP YOU SEUTJE
[01:51:17] <Dr4g> beevi7: $.post() is an option for you, which is an alias function around $.ajax
[01:51:24] <Dr4g> ?$.post @ beevi7
[01:51:25] <bot-t> beevi7, jQuery.post() - Load data from the server using a HTTP POST request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.post/
[01:51:26] <beevi7> but in both cases my firebug->network tells me "OPTIONS save.php"
[01:51:31] <beevi7> not "POST save.php"
[01:51:35] <seutje> coldhead: -OT ISN'T FOR SUPPORT
[01:51:42] <dgouldin> I'm just digging into jQuery's deferred stuff, why does $.when need full Deferred objects? Couldn't it do what it needs with Promise objects?
[01:51:44] <beevi7> any idea why my browser is using "OPTIONS" instead of "POST"?!
[01:52:00] <coldhead> IT CAN BE, YOU'RE NOT THE BOSS OF IT
[01:52:10] <Dr4g> beevi7: no, as we don't have your code - try $.post()
[01:52:51] <beevi7> http://manuel-bieh.de/storage/sites/html5.manuelbieh.com/templates/js/examples/fileapi.js
[01:53:08] <seutje> coldhead: THIS IS TRUE
[01:53:15] <beevi7> ah damnit!

[01:55:12] <Lundy> SargoDarya_: the problem is ... when you enter the customers details and click Submit, it should popup and ask for your Staff ID... after you enter your staff ID and click save it should submit the form to the next page.. but it does not
[01:56:32] <SargoDarya_> Lundy: Are you saving that StaffId somewhere in a global variable?
[01:57:16] <dgouldin> hmm ok just tested it, $.when *does* work with Promise objects, it's just not documented that way: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.when/
[01:57:47] <Lundy> SargoDarya_: setting it into a Hidden field

[02:10:21] <_ramo> how can i bind an event to a link which is inside a <div class="current-title" ?
[02:10:26] <dgouldin> hobs coldhead: docs revisions, wording is a little awkward, could possibly be improved, but the idea is there: http://dpaste.com/hold/548206/
[02:10:35] <_ramo> jQuery('.current-title a') ?
[02:10:39] <coldhead> thanks so much
[02:11:06] <coldhead> this is fine, dgouldin, good work
[02:11:06] <dgouldin> np, just happy it works! :P
[02:14:57] <_ramo> coldhead: do you have a hint?
[02:15:24] <_ramo> childselector?
[02:15:34] <newman|2> Hi. I'm trying to attach scroll event(at the bottom of script.js) to the div with the large table in it at http://bit.ly/lQhmPJ . The div has width and height, and overflow:scroll, but it seems the event never triggers. Have tested in bothg chromium and firefox.
[02:15:37] <coldhead> what you have should work fine
[02:16:05] <dytrivedi> $('.current-title a').click(function(){ blablabla });
[02:16:15] <coldhead> jQuery('.current-title > a') for immediate children only
[02:16:27] <seutje> wai no add zhe element?
[02:16:35] <_ramo> thank you

[02:22:01] <SpecialEmily> coldhead, I wonder what could be said for MEN.EXE >_>
[02:22:46] <coldhead> supposedly MEN.EXE has more terse documentation
[02:22:48] <coldhead> SUPPOSEDLY
[02:23:19] <SpecialEmily> but it keeps sending resource requests for "sex.so"
[02:23:45] <coldhead> hahaha
[02:23:56] <coldhead> and WOMEN.EXE are spinlocked waiting for /dev/flowers
[02:24:03] <coldhead> so offensive
[02:24:19] <SpecialEmily> :P
[02:24:43] <SpecialEmily> yea, its totally offensive. you mix .EXE with linux /dev notation :P
[02:24:56] * SpecialEmily gains 10 dork points
[02:25:59] <coldhead> K1ng: would you please change your nick to King` and ask bot-t of he has any messages for you?
[02:26:03] <coldhead> if he has*
[02:26:10] <seutje> funny, women.EXE with /dev/flowers, somehow wine springs to mind :(
[02:26:20] <coldhead> SpecialEmily: YOU BROUGHT .so INTO THIS
[02:26:29] <coldhead> hahahahha seutje  <3
[02:27:08] <k1ng`> coldhead, how do i ask the bot?
[02:27:09] <bot-t> (8 mins 18 secs ago) <coldhead> tell K1ng` ACTUALLY IF YOU TRY TALKING TO WOMEN YOU WILL SEE THEY ARE SELF DOCUMENTING. TRY A LESS OFFENSIVE QUIT MESSAGE
[02:27:16] <SpecialEmily> coldhead, hah, I guess you're right :p
[02:27:20] <seutje> u just did

[02:28:21] <Jakey> coldhead ur femine
[02:28:25] <_ramo> can i detect with jquery if a video is embedded into a page?
[02:28:25] <Jakey> :D
[02:28:39] <_ramo> a flash player or something?
[02:28:49] <coldhead> k1ng: you can laugh at it quietly to yourself, you don't need to make women uncomfortable
[02:28:52] <Shapeshifter> I'm sorry, can someone please help me out getting back up to speed with this, I'm having a blackout. I have a dom branch like this <div class="a"><div class="b"></div><div class="b"></div></div><div class="a"><div class="b"></div></div> there are many divs of class "a" and each of them contains a number of divs of class "b". Now, how would I find out which is the largest number of "b" divs contained by any div "a"?
[02:28:55] <jigal_> i have in an object an link within a li. How can i get the span which is on the same level as the a within the li?
[02:29:22] <coldhead> i find ann frank jokes funny but i don't go telling them here
[02:29:34] <coldhead> the holocaust was no laughing matter ann frankly i won't stand for it
[02:29:47] <SpecialEmily> ./facepalm
[02:29:57] <seutje> k1ng: I bet Adolf found his final solution thing a bit funny as well
[02:30:03] <Alexer> and here i thought this was a jquery channel :D
[02:30:03] <Shapeshifter> Or more specifically, $(".a") will give me all the a divs, but then what? I don't think .each works because I cannot save the number I counted outside
[02:30:50] <seutje> coldhead: wow, why u gotta be all up in my head thinking my thoughts and shit?
[02:30:52] <Shapeshifter> and $(".a .b") gives me the total number, not the number I want.
[02:30:59] <_ramo> how can i check, if a selector exists?
[02:31:11] <dytrivedi> .length, _ramo
[02:31:18] <_ramo> thank you
[02:31:40] <coldhead> you love it, seutje. PS: i miss you
[02:31:58] <dytrivedi> I miss you too, seutje
[02:32:19] <Lundy> good morning guys, what im trying to do is, when you click submit it validates the form and pops up a model for you to enter your staff ID... after you click OK it should submit the form to the next page but everything I have been trying has just been resubmitting the form http://jsfiddle.net/mYCJT/

[02:36:30] <coldhead> Lundy: i can't really follow what you're doing here. you should be able to use validate to show a message/add some css when a field is invalid and submit when all is well
[02:36:37] <coldhead> with much less code, and much less debugging
[02:36:44] <Shapeshifter> dytrivedi: thank you. My problem is that if I do $(".a > .b") I will get ALL children by ALL .a elements. How can I get the children of each .a element individually?
[02:36:47] <Lundy> cold: http://lundy.me.uk/GFA/add_customer.php?t=67466109ab53a17a111103b0551dc01a&s=1
[02:36:53] <Lundy> fill out the form and hit submit
[02:36:59] <_ramo> can i check if a text exists in this form: <p><i>Abstract , i mean within a <p> tag with exactly this literals?
[02:37:34] <seutje> Shapeshifter: hmz odd, that snippet works on a page though
[02:37:40] <Lundy> after you enter your staff id... and click ok, it should submit the form to "add_customer_step2.php" but it doesnt
[02:38:15] <coldhead> get fab abs?
[02:38:19] <coldhead> what ARE you working on?
[02:38:26] <dytrivedi> ?each @ Shapeshifter
[02:38:27] <bot-t> Shapeshifter, .each(function): Iterate over a jQuery object, executing a function for each matched element. http://api.jquery.com/each/
[02:38:55] <Lundy> coldhead: just a customer database for a company
[02:39:33] <Lundy> keep a record off what customers and wot packages they hav
[02:41:12] <coldhead> Lundy: my first reaction would be to try form.submit() in place of return true for mysubmitfunc -- but again, this seems a very convoluted way to do things
[02:41:39] <coldhead> in my mind the validator should do the submitting, not the prompt() :\
[02:42:04] <seutje> but then u'd be able to validate the staff ID, can't have that!
[02:42:27] <coldhead> oh right
[02:42:39] <Lundy> coldhead: well wot way would be best? ... wot im looking to do is "enter customer details, click submit, popup enter staff id... go to next page"
[02:42:48] <Jakey> Shapeshifter $(".a").children()
[02:42:49] <crystalblue666> www.xxxlivecam.info
[02:43:08] <Lundy> coldhead: adding form.submit just loops it then to keep entering staff id
[02:43:22] <Jakey> fuck spamers crystabll
[02:43:54] <coldhead> the super simplest way, Lundy , would be to have a submit handler that a) validates the form, b) gets the staff ID and c) submits the form
[02:44:02] <coldhead> i mean that just makes sense
[02:44:06] <coldhead> i have a headache and i understand it
[02:44:10] <newman|2> Isn't 'var totals = $('#btmright tr.totalrow td')' allowed? When I evaluate the expression I get a lot of elements, but totals is empty in the debugger.
[02:44:54] <coldhead> that's very allowed but perhaps it is a scoping thing, newman|2?
[02:45:03] <Lundy> bit like coldhead... on click #submit_id - validate - prompt staff id ... submit form
[02:45:20] <dytrivedi> helllllooooooo newman|2
[02:45:42] <coldhead> ?eval var x = 'lol'; function mamma () {var x = 'aids'}; mamma(); x;
[02:45:43] <bot-t> coldhead: "lol"
[02:45:50] <newman|2> coldhead: Hmm..
[02:46:12] <newman|2> dytrivedi: helllllooooo there!
[02:46:40] <coldhead> Lundy: the i appreciate that they're similar but in my way the submit handler is the boss of everything, in your way the form delegates to validate who delegates to prompt...
[02:46:45] <dytrivedi> ?eval var x = 'lol'; function aids() {x = 'mamma'; } aids(); x;
[02:46:46] <bot-t> dytrivedi: "mamma"
[02:46:50] <coldhead> but if your way makes more sense to you, good luck
[02:47:03] <coldhead> I SALUTE YOU
[02:47:50] <coldhead> "the only thing i ever take from you will be my leave"
[02:48:28] <dytrivedi> hah
[02:53:14] <Shapeshifter> Jakey: thanks, that's what I needed
[02:54:06] <beasty> Shapeshifter: you played 'prototype' ?
[02:54:19] <Shapeshifter> beasty: nope, unrelated
[02:54:39] <beasty> Shapeshifter: ok just asking

[03:16:17] <dytrivedi> hmm you do sound like an Indian, rohan1790
[03:16:34] <rohan1790> indeed
[03:16:38] <dytrivedi> Indians are racists

[03:17:29] <rohan1790> ok. then what?
[03:17:41] <Alexer> rohan1790, nothing, you just loop around?
[03:17:52] <rohan1790> I stopped. :D
[03:18:09] <Alexer> i think my infinite loop -detector may be broken :(
[03:18:36] <rohan1790> or you are just struck with the law of averages!
[03:19:21] <Alexer> ARE YOU SAYING I'M AVERAGE, HUH?!??1+1+
[03:19:23] <Alexer> >:)
[03:20:21] <dytrivedi> hahahah
[03:20:29] <dytrivedi> rohan1790: well I am an Indian, to start with
[03:20:35] <rohan1790> no, I am saying your infinite loop detector is based on a finite inspection :P
[03:20:48] <rohan1790> dytrivedi, I know trivedi is an Indian surname.
[03:20:53] <dytrivedi> :P
[03:20:56] <dytrivedi> there you go
[03:21:28] <rohan1790> so you think you're a racist? strange submission.
[03:21:30] <rohan1790> :D
[03:21:30] <Fratyr> Hey guys. I have this slider: http://jsfiddle.net/u6cN4/1/ which opens a div on mouseover on a "button", and closes div when the mouse left the div. It works 2-3 cycles, and then another try to hover It just hides everything or blinks... can anyone take a look at the code please?
[03:21:38] <dytrivedi> meeeeetingggggg
[03:21:47] <dytrivedi> rohan1790: no I don't think I am racist
[03:21:50] <dytrivedi> I am racist
[03:22:10] <rohan1790> ok.
[03:22:15] <dytrivedi> and god help you if you're from south India
[03:22:28] <dytrivedi> thankfully, though, Rohan is not a south Indian name
[03:22:35] <dytrivedi> so you're spared

[03:24:55] <rohan1790> Fratyr - I see nothing there
[03:25:03] <Fratyr> m?
[03:25:36] <Fratyr> how come
[03:26:03] <rohan1790> dunno. I clicked on run
[03:26:05] <rohan1790> empty window
[03:26:14] <Fratyr> duh
[03:27:00] <Fratyr> cuz I have some problems in the code?:) that's why I'm asking
[03:27:56] <rohan1790> you said it works for 2-3 cycles
[03:33:57] <sector119> Hello. I append some dom elements to the document, those elements has some class="foobar", but that css class does nothing... why?
[03:37:21] <silverd> hey guys, I am looking to get the count of table heads, but i want to exclude those that just have &nbsp in them, what's the best way to go about filtering so I can do add it onto $('#table th').length ??
[03:38:09] <timing> create your own filter();
[03:38:11] <Fratyr> rohan1790: take this: http://jsfiddle.net/u6cN4/3/
[03:38:30] <jigal_> hello http://jsfiddle.net/r9VDA/15/ . I want that by onLoad the text image 1, which is in a hidden span next to the image appears in the description div.
[03:38:41] <timing> silverd: $('#table th').filter(function(){ /* check for content here and return false or true based on criteria */  });
[03:39:07] <timing> silverd: then you can get the length of that result
[03:41:22] <silverd> timing, that's great, i'll have a play around now, thanks for the quick response :)
[03:43:20] <KingDosser> Whats the best jQuery AutoSuggest?
[03:46:06] <jonee> try jquery-ui autocomplete KingDosser
[03:46:21] <KingDosser> Will do jonee. Cheers
[03:47:37] <jonee> KingDosser, this one http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/
[03:47:47] <KingDosser> Yeah Im on it :)
[03:48:05] <kranZ> i have an issue with jQuery().load , loading results of a script into a div, the script is always running when clicked just the content doesnt exchange everytime
[03:48:26] <jonee> There is an autocomplete plugin for jquery so beware that is different and it might confuse you KingDosser
[03:49:38] <KingDosser> Okay cheers
[03:50:10] <L4suicide> anyone know a method of waiting until a gif animation has run before loading a site? Using a timer is very browser dependant :(
[03:50:35] <newman|2> I don't get it. I have a div with id, width, height and overflow set. Content is way larger than the div, though widths and heights aren't set explicitly or anything. I attach .scroll() to the div id, but still scroll event refuses to trigger! Did I miss anything obvious here??
[03:51:12] <rohan1790> overflow:scroll . does it work?
[03:51:50] <jonee> L4suicide, I think you can preload the image in plain javascript
[03:52:41] <seutje> jigal_: gotta traverse to the span -> http://jsfiddle.net/seutje/r9VDA/16/
[03:52:57] <newman|2> rohan1790: Was that for me? Yes, it's set to scroll. But nope, it doesn't work. http://bit.ly/lQhmPJ if you want to look, div with table, bottom right.
[03:54:01] <rohan1790> newman: which division you're talking about?
[03:54:42] <KingDosser> What I'm trying to do is have a drop down that searches from mysql database (using php) and autosuggests values from the database there will be a title and description for each entry.
[03:55:53] <Alexer> djQuery, i just found the thing that i was originally looking for yesterday
[03:55:53] <Alexer> < Alexer> is there any way to poke jQuery plugin internals? for example, the ui.autocomplete plugin has "this.menu = ..." inside "_create", can i get to it somehow?
[03:56:03] <newman|2> rohan1790: The div/box with a lot of numbers, to the right/bottomish, middleish :-]
[03:56:14] <newman|2> The big one that is
[03:56:30] <Alexer> $('#myautocomplete').data('autocomplete').menu
[03:56:32] <newman|2> rohan1790: #btmright
[03:56:53] <rohan1790> a scroll appears on my window. what is the desired look?
[03:58:23] <newman|2> rohan1790: Yes, that's ok. But at the very bottom of script.js I attach a handler to the .scroll() event for that div. It just shows a simple popup. But as it is now it never triggers :(
[03:58:26] <krz> $('#comments').find('ul').find('a[data-remote][href$=/comments/9]').parents('li') is returning 4 li's. how do i return only the parent li?
[03:58:45] <spyzer> hello everyone, I wish to create an effect where a box kind of thing pops-up and the rest of the page in the visible background is completely disabled. Using jquery fadeout visually things have been disabled BUT user interaction like a:hover etc it still present how do i disable those?? please tell
[03:59:17] <krz> spyzer: have a look at colorbox
[04:00:04] <spyzer> krz: is there no simple way to do it through jquery itself?
[04:00:51] <krz> spyzer: yea, i would z-index a div that has a transparent bg
[04:01:02] <krz> so that the div is in the top most level
[04:01:17] <krz> that will disable all the elements below it
[04:01:21] <spyzer> okay and that div covers the entire background
[04:01:27] <krz> yea
[04:01:36] <spyzer> okay thanks krz :)
[04:02:14] <jigal_> seutje: thnx
[04:02:16] <jigal_> it works
[04:03:11] <krz> anyone?
[04:04:10] <seutje> ?closest @ krz
[04:04:17] <seutje> ?bot
[04:04:19] <seutje> :(
[04:04:39] <seutje> krz: http://api.jquery.com/closest/
[04:04:56] <krz> actually, my regex may be wrong
[04:05:19] <krz> $('#comments').find('ul a[data-remote][href$=/comments/9]') returns [a /songs/w...ments/10, a /songs/w...mments/9, a /songs/w...mments/8, a /songs/w...mments/3]
[04:05:26] <krz> thats strange. why is it doing that?
[04:06:32] <seutje> krz: what regex?
[04:07:20] <krz> seutje: [href$=/comments/9] shouldnt return only a /songs/w...mments/9 ?
[04:07:37] <krz> why is it returning all?
[04:08:07] <seutje> not sure if it's all to happy about slashes
[04:10:03] <sector119> I have some css class at table element, which apply changes to table rows, and when I append row to that table, those changes aren't applied! why?
[04:10:21] <krz> seutje: how can i make this work?
[04:10:46] <seutje> krz: I get an "unrecognized expression error" when using slashes in there
[04:11:00] <seutje> xcept if I quote them
[04:11:14] <seutje> $('a[href$="foo/bar/foo"]')
[04:12:08] <krz> nice
[04:12:09] <krz> that works
[04:12:50] <krz> thanks seutje
[04:15:53] <seutje> why did an ever invent RTL languages? q.q
[04:18:37] <spyzer> krz: i did that thing it worked, but when i am trying to reset things that is make the background interactable again, it ain;t working. I checked through firebug, I changed the z-index of upper div to a lower value and background to higher and yet things are uncahged??
[04:20:38] <spyzer> krz : i am also playing with opacity btw
[04:22:01] <spyzer> Okay it worked out sorry
[04:22:09] <eliasson> How can I replace (addClass) a old class with a new class?
[04:22:09] <eliasson> t ex
[04:22:16] <eliasson> <div class="limbino red">
[04:22:25] <eliasson> $('div').addClass('green');
[04:22:31] <eliasson> green should then override red.
[04:22:33] <eliasson> Possible?
[04:22:48] <eliasson> Or do I need to use removeClass('red') before? :|
[04:22:58] <seutje> toggleClass('red green')
[04:23:14] <eliasson> seutje: What if I do not know which class that is being used?
[04:23:28] <seutje> if u want to make sure ur removing, use remove
[04:23:52] <eliasson> The problem is that I've got around 10 classes.
[04:24:02] <eliasson> E.g
[04:24:15] <eliasson> .removeClass('red green blue orange ...').addClass(
[04:24:26] <eliasson> Isn't it possible to "override"?
[04:24:40] <seutje> .attr('class', 'boom all gone')
[04:24:59] <eliasson> div.limbino.input.red { background: url('../img/layout/form_red.png') top left no-repeat; }
[04:25:02] <eliasson> div.limbino.input.green { background: url('../img/layout/form_green.png') top left no-repeat; }
[04:25:12] <eliasson> I would like green to override red if applied
[04:26:42] <seutje> eliasson: jQuery.fn.replaceClass = function(toReplace,replaceWith){ return $(this).each(function(){ return $(this).removeClass(toReplace).addClass(replaceWith); }); };
[04:27:04] <seutje> then u cal just $('.foo').replaceClass('foo', 'bar')
[04:27:19] <seutje> oh wow, wait
[04:27:27] <Alexer> is there a method in jQuery for html-escaping data? like .text(), but one that returns the escaped value instead of replacing the contents of an element?
[04:27:28] <seutje> I maketh a booboo
[04:27:41] <eliasson> seutje: This is what I've got now:
[04:27:53] <eliasson> <div class="limbino input white" id="email">
[04:28:05] <eliasson> And I have to do:
[04:28:06] <eliasson> <a href="#" onclick="$('#email').removeClass('white red green').addClass('red');">red</a><br />
[04:28:25] <eliasson> I would like red to override the "white"'s background-attibute then applied.
[04:28:27] <nerdfunk> hey there
[04:28:33] <eliasson> Rather than removing all known colors.
[04:29:18] <seutje> use this instead: jQuery.fn.replaceClass = function(toReplace,replaceWith){ return this.each(function(){ return $(this).removeClass(toReplace).addClass(replaceWith); }); };
[04:29:25] <nerdfunk> Having trouble accessing this api using getJSON -> 'http://min.us/api/GetItems/mvjf2eq?callback=?',
[04:29:39] <nerdfunk> can someone else give it a shot before i give a bug report to them
[04:29:58] <Alexer> i could just make one myself, but i'd be really surprised if jQuery didn't already have one.. i just can't find it, searching for "escape" only returns ".text()" >.>'
[04:30:09] <seutje> eliasson: maybe u need a .magicallyKnowWtfItIsIwantAndThenJustDoItForMe() method
[04:30:26] <xec> seutje: i want that too
[04:30:43] <eliasson> seutje: Well. I was rather hoping that it's possible to override css-elements :)
[04:30:45] <xec> i could replace all my scripts with that one line
[04:30:58] <eliasson> but thanks for the help-
[04:31:01] <seutje> what's a css-element?
[04:31:08] <seutje> <css></css> ? o.O
[04:31:14] <eliasson> sorry, attibute.
[04:31:20] <eliasson> attribute*
[04:31:23] <seutje> oh a style attribute
[04:31:50] <seutje> u mean like .css('background-color', '')?
[04:33:41] <nerdfunk> does this work for anyone ? $.getJSON('http://min.us/api/GetItems/mvjf2eq?callback=?', function(data) {console.log(data);})
[04:34:07] <nerdfunk> seems to return JSON but i get this error: Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token :
[04:34:25] <seutje> where's yo callback, dawg?
[04:37:21] <nerdfunk> callback=? you mean ?

[04:58:33] <Whirl3d> No one has a suggestion for format/container/transport of a full-screen 10 second video that serves as an intro to a website? (I know it sux, but the customer wants it)
[04:58:45] <anli_> Can I pass parameters to a <script src="foo.js"></script> beside using foo.js?a=4&b=6 ?
[05:01:42] <Alexer> Whirl3d, well, you're asking about video formats/containers/transports on a jquery channel, go figure?
[05:02:11] <Whirl3d> Alexer, I am leading up to the jquery part, go figure that first...
[05:02:44] <MatthiasVance> Whirl3d: Your argument is invalid. :)
[05:02:51] <Whirl3d> I need to be able to, using jQuery, not flash, show the movie without controls taking up the full browser window
[05:03:50] <Alexer> Whirl3d, that's better (but i still don't know the answer)
[05:04:24] <Whirl3d> If I could do it in Flash, it would be no problem. But in jQuery, I can only find plugins that want to embed the video as a player...not just a streaming (or simulated streaming) video source
[05:06:38] <MatthiasVance> Whirl3d: I think you still have to pick a format / container / transport first.
[05:07:00] <Whirl3d> Matthias Vance, hence the original question
[05:07:35] <MatthiasVance> Yeah, but this is still the wrong channel.
[05:09:29] <Whirl3d> I've been logged into this channel for the last two weeks and it is more likely that I will find a generous/experienced soul in this channel to provide advice or direction (even off topic) than any other channel. Though I hear what you are saying, it is worth asking...specially when it's not really busy.

[05:16:10] <Diverdude> I am using jquery (jrating) which makes an ajax call. On the server i do: echo json_encode($aResponse); aResponse is an array that has an entry called message. How do i display this message in an alert box?
[05:17:57] <seutje> Diverdude: alert(aResponse.message) ? o.O
[05:19:04] <Diverdude> onSuccess : function(){alert('Success : your rate has been saved :)');}  well....is aResponse avaiable in this alert box?
[05:21:15] <Diverdude> seutje, no it does not
[05:24:29] <Diverdude> seutje, it does not show the alert box
[05:25:09] <Diverdude> seutje, if i do alert(aResponse.message); nothing happens, but if i do alert("aResponse.message"); the alert box shows
[05:29:20] <fish_> hi
[05:29:24] <seutje> Diverdude: forreal?
[05:29:35] <seutje> try adding the argument to ur anonymous function
[05:29:58] <seutje> or if ur dead set on not doing that, alert(arguments[0].message) or some shit
[05:30:26] <fish_> i'm playing around with this nice templating plugin an wonder how read a element from a hash in a each function block
[05:30:49] <Diverdude> seutje, i can see in firebug that there is something called message:
[05:30:50] <Diverdude> {"error":false,"message":"Your rate has been successfuly recorded. Thanks for your rate :)1","server":"<strong>Success answer :<\/strong> Success : Your rate has been recorded. Thanks for your rate :)<br \/><strong>Rate received :<\/strong> 4<br \/><strong>ID to update :<\/strong> 1"}
[05:30:57] <fish_> i've got {{each foo}} ${$bar[foo]} ... but that doesn't work
[05:31:04] <Diverdude> but i cannot get it out in the alert box
[05:32:33] <seutje> Diverdude: well, whatever the shit is u logged, use the message property on that
[05:32:36] <Diverdude> this is what i do: onSuccess : function(data){alert(data.message);}
[05:32:42] <fish_> ah looks like the doc i was looking at was too old..
[05:32:55] <seutje> that should do it
[05:33:05] <Diverdude> seutje, but nothing happens
[05:33:29] <seutje> Diverdude: maybe something asploded window.alert
[05:33:37] <Diverdude> seutje, However if i do  onSuccess : function(data){alert("data.message");}   the alert box appears
[05:34:06] <seutje> funky
[05:34:35] <seutje> try logging instead of alerting so execution doesn't get all fucked
[05:35:56] <Diverdude> seutje, console.write(); ?
[05:36:16] <seutje> log
[05:37:14] <Diverdude> seutje, this shoud be ok right : onSuccess : function(data){Console.log("data.message");} ?
[05:37:32] <seutje> lowercase c
[05:38:24] <Diverdude> seutje, ack. its the same problem
[05:38:36] <seutje> don't quote data.message
[05:38:50] <seutje> u should rly look at some JS basics
[05:38:58] <Diverdude> seutje, if i quoute it something is written. If i dont nothing is written
[05:39:21] <seutje> fine, then quote it
[05:39:21] <Diverdude> seutje, no i know when to quoute and not. I am using it to test
[05:39:35] <Diverdude> seutje, hehe you dont understand the problem i think
[05:39:44] <seutje> I don't even wanna understand anymore tbh
[05:39:56] <nlogax> hahaha
[05:40:02] <Diverdude> seutje, please dont...seems to be a bit to advanced for you
[05:40:30] <seutje> obviously, alerting a string is way over my head
[05:40:43] <Diverdude> obviously yes
[05:41:15] <Alexer> ._.'
[05:45:13] <Diverdude> this is lame
[05:46:52] <seutje> ur telling me!
[05:46:52] <Diverdude> on the documentation they also do not show it: http://www.myjqueryplugins.com/jRating/demo
[05:47:59] <Diverdude> seutje, yes
[05:48:42] <Diverdude> seutje, i dont get why it has to be so freakin difficult...its just a lame message to be printed. how hard can it be
[05:50:53] <seutje> Diverdude: I like how u kept me in the illusion that this was a regular ajax call
[05:51:23] <seutje> little did I know, you were using a lil plugin that DOESN'T GIVE ME ANY ARGUMENTS IN MY SUCCESS HANDLER
[05:52:31] <Diverdude> seutje, hahaha is it really because it does not send anything in the success handler....how lame is it that they then post a response message in their php example
[05:52:42] <Diverdude> omg
[05:52:56] <Diverdude> seutje, but ok...yes you didnt know that. sorry, my bad
[05:53:11] <seutje> u rly like the word "lame", don't u?
[05:53:23] <timing> SuperLeem
[05:53:38] <Diverdude> seutje, i kinda thought that was the reason....but i figured...i cannot be., That would be to stuid
[05:53:41] <Diverdude> stupid
[05:53:42] <seutje> leemgrond!
[05:54:06] <Diverdude> lame lame lame plugin
[05:54:29] <Diverdude> hilarious
[05:54:44] <Diverdude> ridiculous
[05:57:13] <Alexer> hilaridiculous?
[05:57:33] <seutje> Diverdude: open up the plugin, edit line 160 and slide in the arguments
[05:58:06] <seutje> then send the author an e-mail or something since this doesn't seem to have a repo
[05:58:17] <seutje> and please, tell him example is with an "A"
[06:01:15] <Diverdude> seutje, hah yes
[06:01:21] <Diverdude> exemple :D
[06:01:38] <Diverdude> i should just make my own plugin instead of this crap
[06:01:43] <seutje> u might also wanna add the arguments for the error handler
[06:02:00] <Diverdude> seutje, indeed
[06:02:10] <seutje> yea, maybe u should, this thing seems to contain debugger data
[06:02:45] <Diverdude> i kinda hoped i found something usefull...alas this seems to never be the case
[06:04:32] <Diverdude> if you want something done properly you have to do it yourself :(
[06:12:16] <Over|taf> hi all !
[06:12:58] <Over|taf> question about jquery ui / draggable : is there an option to prevent overlap of 2 divs ?
[06:14:15] <seutje> isn't css and the regular document flow responsible for that?
[06:17:22] <Over|taf> how am i supposed to prevent 2 draggables overlapping via css ? oO
[06:18:54] <seutje> oh, u don't mean after dropping?
[06:19:02] <Over|taf> nea :)
[06:19:12] <Over|taf> i just want my 2 divs cannot overlap on screen :)

[06:22:42] <TehCodr> is there a different chatroom for jQuery where I can ask questions, or is it all this?
[06:28:59] <iszak> TehCodr, this is it! don't worry, we don't bite.
[06:29:35] <dhlfrs> is this it?
[06:29:38] <seutje> iszak: speak for urself
[06:29:51] <TehCodr> lol
[06:29:56] <iszak> seutje, you bite? :3
[06:30:09] <seutje> can't promise I won't
[06:30:24] <iszak> you need a muzzle.
[06:30:27] <xec> I'm feeling a bit hungry too
[06:30:39] <TehCodr> I'll learn the basics of jQuery before I start asking you for... nevermind
[06:30:55] <Diverdude> well that was easy to fix
[06:31:24] <iszak> TehCodr, chances are if you ask a question that can be solved by searching through the documentation someone will simply provide you a link.
[06:31:36] <xec> TehCodr: hehe, if you wanted to ask something, go ahead and ask rather than asking if you can ask :)
[06:31:51] <TehCodr> xD
[06:32:06] <TehCodr> why is jquery whitespace-free?
[06:32:17] <TehCodr> I learn by learning the functions
[06:32:28] <DarsVaeda> hi, I have a table with rows where one <td> contains a checkbox the <tbody id="contentProjects"> to select all the checkboxes I do: $("#contentProjects :input").serialize() - right?
[06:32:51] <iszak> TehCodr, ypu
[06:33:15] <iszak> TehCodr, you're viewing the compressed version, they remove whitespace and minimize code to reduce the bytes needed to be sent over http
[06:33:19] <iszak> ?source @ TehCodr
[06:33:20] <bot-t> TehCodr, jQuery 1.5 - http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.5/jquery.js
[06:33:25] <iszak> there's the uncompressed version
[06:35:36] <TehCodr> ty
[06:35:46] <xec> DarsVaeda: i believe you need to call .serialize() on the form element, not tbody (or input)
[06:37:45] <xec> DarsVaeda: but to select checkboxes you might want to sett .attr('checked', true) ?
[06:38:26] <mdsdss> hi just a quick question, is there a limit to the number of events you can bind to elements on a page. For example if I have a 1000 elements can I have 1000 events (i.e click events per element) ?
[06:38:31] <DarsVaeda> if I select "var select = $("#contentProjects").filter(":input")" and then do a for i in select, I get a bunch of jquery crap but not what I want to select...
[06:38:49] <DarsVaeda> I to get the ids of all selected checkboxes actually
[06:38:53] <DarsVaeda> +need
[06:38:58] <iszak> mdsdss, I would assume that limit would be set up by the javascript engine which would be based on the browser.
[06:39:03] <mdsdss> DarsVaeda have you tried each ?
[06:39:35] <iszak> mdsdss, but keeping events to a minimum is ideal, what you may want to look into is event delegation
[06:39:41] <mdsdss> iszak : do you know what the limits would be ?
[06:39:48] <gsnedders> mdsdss: There's no practical limit
[06:39:52] <iszak> mdsdss, I honestly would have no idea.
[06:40:12] <seutje> DarsVaeda: something like var myArr = []; $('input:checkbox:checked').each(function() { if (this.id) { myArr.push(id); } })?
[06:40:18] <iszak> mdsdss, I would probably try and keep events < 100 and use event delegation to do so if there are lots of events.
[06:40:24] <mdsdss> gsnedders : thanks
[06:41:16] <mdsdss> iszak: thanks i'll give it  ashot, I've been reading up on event delegation
[06:41:52] <dts1> I understand that jScrollPane is one of the most common ways to customize scroll bars in jQ. But when i try out the example in Chrome and scroll using the scroll wheel (eg. Up, down) in an area that scrolls in both directions the pane also scrolls to the right while i'm scrolling up and down. Does anyone know why this is http://jscrollpane.kelvinluck.com/basic.html
[06:42:27] <superfrogger79> hey guys sorry to jump in, but can anyone reccomend a good starting place for someone with good php css and html skills to learn jquery? thanks
[06:43:21] <DarsVaeda> seutje yours is almost working :)
[06:43:23] <ablomen> superfrogger79, the documentation and the tutorials section in the docs
[06:43:34] <DarsVaeda> but it is $(":input:checkbox:checked")
[06:43:37] <DarsVaeda> thanks!
[06:43:59] <superfrogger79> thanks, i had checked out the documentation at a glance, but wondered if anyone had any good experiences elsewhere?
[06:44:03] <ablomen> superfrogger79, though if you don't know any javascript start with that
[06:44:29] <ablomen> jQuery is just a library, so it's better (imho) to first learn the actual language
[06:44:37] <superfrogger79> ablomen: ok i shall start with that, thanks for the advice :)
[06:44:50] <systemfault> superfrogger79: google for "eloquent javascript"
[06:44:55] <systemfault> superfrogger79: Free and good.
[06:45:00] <dxgriffiths> ugh
[06:45:46] <superfrogger79> ablomen: just googled it, looks perfect, thanks for the help
[06:46:04] <superfrogger79> sorry my bad, that was at system fault
[06:47:29] <TC_> http://87.102.89.203/autotags/ - type in for instance... J it brings up Java, click it and it's suppose to insert it into the textbox. Only, it's not doing so. I've tried an alert and it's not spitting it out. Therefor it isn't hitting the click function. The line for that is here: $(options.tagArea).delegate("a", "click", function() {
[06:47:32] <TC_> youc an see it if you view source
[06:47:49] <TC_> the a's are generated dynamically also in the jQuery...
[06:47:58] <TC_> which is why I've used delegate...
[06:48:18] <TC_> got to be somethin really simple >.<
[06:48:54] <TC_> options.tagArea has a value of #tagArea
[06:49:54] <TC_> even when I give it a default <a> to begin wiht, it's not doing so.
[06:52:28] <TC_> anyone know what i've done wrong
[06:53:37] <xec> what is options.tagArea?
[06:53:55] <TC_> [14:48] <TC_> options.tagArea has a value of #tagArea
[06:54:01] <TC_> <span id="tagArea">
[06:54:11] <xec> right, l2read
[06:54:13] <TC_> this works, as the links actually get placed into it.
[06:55:21] <TC_> l2read... me or you? You asked what it is, I said it has a value of #tagArea which the span has...
[06:55:32] <xec> me :)
[06:55:35] <TC_> ahhh lol
[06:56:29] <TC_> So any idea on the problem? :(
[06:56:38] <xec> looking
[06:57:24] <xec> firebug is bugging a bit, whining about "script tag should have type attribute set to "text/javascript"
[06:57:46] <TC_> Ok i'll put that in
[06:58:00] <seutje> DarsVaeda: heh, rly? that's ur comment?
[06:58:11] <TC_> it's in now.
[06:58:22] <seutje> good thing all checkboxes aren't of element type input, right? :/
[06:58:37] <seutje> DarsVaeda: should prolly point out u made ur selector less performant
[06:59:23] <xec> TC_: im inexperienced with delegates, but maybe you need to attach it after document is ready
[06:59:36] <DarsVaeda> I should use .filter(":input") before, right?
[06:59:37] <beepbeep_> hey all, when using .each(), is there any way to retrieve the current element that you are looping over?
[06:59:42] <beepbeep_> $(this) ?
[06:59:47] <systemfault> beepbeep_: Yes
[06:59:51] <beepbeep_> ty
[06:59:56] <systemfault> beepbeep_: Or the second argument to the callback
[07:00:02] <systemfault> beepbeep_: The first being the index
[07:00:09] <TC_> You mean.. $(function() { $.autotags({ ... }) }); ?
[07:00:42] <TC_> that works :)
[07:00:55] <xec> awesome
[07:01:03] <xec> im getting better and better at wild guesses
[07:01:07] <xec> xD
[07:01:48] <TC_> :P
[07:02:03] <seutje> DarsVaeda: why?
[07:02:18] <seutje> ?eval $('<div><textarea></textarea><input type="checkbox" /><input type="checkbox" checked /><input type="radio" checked /></div>').find('input:checkbox:checked').length
[07:02:19] <bot-t> seutje: TypeError: div is undefined
[07:02:22] <seutje> FUCK U
[07:02:30] <DarsVaeda> because of your comment and because the docu says so
[07:02:52] <xec> lol
[07:02:55] <seutje> DarsVaeda: u said u had to use :input instead of input
[07:03:04] <DarsVaeda> yeah
[07:03:09] <seutje> :input also matches <textarea>
[07:03:17] <seutje> but checkboxes are always <input>
[07:03:24] <seutje> so why the fuck would u want to match textareas?
[07:03:34] <DarsVaeda> I do not want
[07:03:45] <DarsVaeda> but without the ":" it did not work :)
[07:03:57] <seutje> what the?
[07:04:08] <pif> hi, 1.6.1 disables beauty tips, any workaround ?
[07:04:09] <DarsVaeda> don't ask me why I have zero degree knowledge of jquery :P
[07:04:18] <seutje> I don't believe u
[07:04:37] <hobs> thanks dgouldin
[07:04:57] <DarsVaeda> seutje: http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41YsKJjReDL.jpg? :D
[07:05:06] <DarsVaeda> http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41YsKJjReDL.jpg i mean
[07:06:02] <sgentle> so I have a question about traversal... I'm trying to do something dependent on the ancestry of each element in a selector
[07:06:49] <sgentle> as an example, if I had a bunch of elements like <div data-concat="foo"> <div data-concat="bar"></div></div> I would want to get "foobar" out
[07:07:03] <seutje> DarsVaeda: works fine here http://jsfiddle.net/5ACXQ/
[07:08:10] <sgentle> the two ways I can think of for doing that are manually traversing the DOM, or doing .parents on each element
[07:09:17] <sgentle> the second sounds like it would have awful performance, the first... well, I can't think of a way to do that other than by calling .children repeatedly
[07:09:47] <sgentle> so I'm pretty open to an idea that doesn't suck :D
[07:12:43] <DarsVaeda> seutje: I can't get it to run in both versions in jsfiddle...I don't know, whatever...let's put it to the x-files
[07:13:13] <TC_> Gah. how do I use console.writeline
[07:13:18] <TC_> it says Console is not defined >.<
[07:13:31] <seutje> r u blaming a crummy 90s fox show?
[07:14:04] <DarsVaeda> most likely
[07:14:04] <TC_> oh, console.log
[07:14:09] <seutje> paste less images, more coads
[07:14:15] <dxgriffiths> TC_: console isn't necessarily defined... it's there by default in Safari/Chrome, but Firefox requires the Firebug extension.
[07:14:20] <DarsVaeda> no probably myself, bet I made some stupid mistake
[07:18:38] <TC_> Here, http://jsfiddle.net/nWU6M/2/ the spaces are creating elements in the array, I try remove them with my for loop ... but it's still producing them. To see that happening, open up your console... and you shall see "hello--"
[07:18:45] <TC_> i'm joining with -
[07:18:52] <TC_> so it's thinking there is I think two extra elements
[07:18:57] <Diverdude> how do i in a jquery callback function do something like $(this).parentNode().findClass('.myclass').unhide(); ?
[07:19:03] <Diverdude> is that possible?
[07:20:01] <TC_> basically I want to strip all spaces but I do need to split them so I have an array of words.
[07:20:11] <dxgriffiths> Diverdude: Sure, but just use parent().children or parent().contents (depending on what you want)
[07:20:59] <Diverdude> dxgriffiths, okay, and is there a search function that searches a node for subnodes of a specific class?
[07:22:38] <dxgriffiths> Diverdude: do you want just the immediate children, or a deep search?
[07:23:14] <Diverdude> dxgriffiths, deep search since it has to go 2 levels down
[07:23:23] <TC_> even tried this: http://jsfiddle.net/nWU6M/5/ but it's stil producing 2 extra elements >.
[07:23:42] <Diverdude> basically it should go this->1 level up->2 levels down
[07:24:14] <dxgriffiths> Diverdude: ok try parent().find('.myclass')
[07:24:19] <dxgriffiths> See what you get.
[07:24:38] * TC_ waves ... my turn <3
[07:24:39] <Diverdude> i have <div><span>text</span><span><img/></span><div>jquery node</div></div>
[07:25:11] <dxgriffiths> TC_: still waiting on acknowledgement of the last answer!
[07:25:30] <TC_> last answer?
[07:26:14] <Diverdude> dxgriffiths, hmm yes ok...only thing is that it seems i cannot do console.log($(this).parent())), and if i do console.log($(this))) it says [undefined, undefined, undefined, undefined]
[07:26:44] <TC_> If by the last answer, you mean from what xec said with the document ready - I've done that, thats fine. it's just these whitespaces.
[07:27:02] <dxgriffiths> Diverdude: what does it say if you just console.log(this)?
[07:27:55] <Diverdude> dxgriffiths, then it prints an object
[07:28:14] <dxgriffiths> Diverdude: the reason I ask is that if this is not an HTML element then $(this) won't be very useful.
[07:28:42] <dxgriffiths> TC_: I was answering your question about the console.
[07:28:44] <Diverdude> dxgriffiths, yes ok...it is not an HTML object. it is an jquery object i think
[07:29:04] <TC_> oh yeah, it's console.log, and i understand it won't work if there is no console. I have a console.
[07:29:13] <Diverdude> dxgriffiths, so i can do this.parent().find() instead?
[07:29:14] <TC_> hence why I'm seeing these values "hello--" and "3"
[07:29:46] <TC_> and I said after I asked why it won't work "oh... console.log" or something similar :P
[07:30:09] <Diverdude> dxgriffiths, hmm this.parent() also does not seem to work
[07:30:20] <dxgriffiths> Diverdude: you can only use jQuery methods like parent() if `this` is a jQuery object.
[07:31:05] <dxgriffiths> Diverdude: can you post to jsfiddle or gisthub?
[07:31:31] <dxgriffiths> TC_: looking...
[07:31:35] <Diverdude> dxgriffiths, the output of console.log(this) ?
[07:31:38] <TC_> thank you
[07:32:29] <dxgriffiths> Diverdude: a snip of your code, preferably, so we can see what this is likely to be.
[07:34:05] <dxgriffiths> TC_: I have an answer for you.
[07:34:10] <TC_> Yay
[07:34:26] <Diverdude> dxgriffiths, http://jsfiddle.net/rU8Nt/
[07:34:28] <dxgriffiths> Take another look at this line: var string = bits[key].replace(" ", "");
[07:35:01] <ShawnRisk> how do I delay the first slide everytime it comes around in a slideshow?  I have tried delay and timeout with no luck.  I am using the jQuery Cycle Plugin.
[07:35:10] <dxgriffiths> TC_: the replace method is assigning a *new* string to your variable, not modifying bits[key].
[07:35:32] <Diverdude> dxgriffiths, so as you see, it is in the OnSuccess function
[07:35:50] <dxgriffiths> TC_: that's why your array seems the same, it's not being altered.
[07:35:53] <TC_> I understand, but that's also why I had: if (string == '')
[07:36:07] <mateo_> Hello, i have some performance issues by using +1000 cells droppable (jquery-ui) in a table. I tried to make the whole table droppable but the over callback event target is alway the table itself. Have you any tips or ideas to get the real target in the over callback ?
[07:36:49] <TC_> but I've changed it to: bits[key] = bits[key].replace(" ", "");
[07:36:52] <TC_> that doesn't do anything
[07:36:58] <TC_> infact, it has more elements :/
[07:36:59] <xec> TC_: what if you replace multiple spaces with a single space before you split? something like: var string = "hello    ".replace(/ +/g, " ");
[07:37:18] <TC_> hm
[07:37:29] <TC_> let me try that
[07:38:15] <felo> Is that possible to compare a javascript with a php va riable?
[07:38:36] <foertel> hey ... is actual jQuery UI working with 1.6.1. even it is shipped with 1.5.1?
[07:38:45] <felo> dxgriffiths:Is that possible to compare a javascript with a php va riable?
[07:38:53] <Diverdude> dxgriffiths, ?
[07:38:57] <TC_> little bit better xec, but that one does still have 1 more extra element. http://jsfiddle.net/nWU6M/7/
[07:39:52] <TC_> here dxgriffiths: http://jsfiddle.net/nWU6M/10/ modifying the array, but still no difference.
[07:39:55] <felo> what are you doing TC_?
[07:40:06] <Diverdude> dxgriffiths, and if it is a jquery object, then how can i get the html object it is contained in?
[07:40:15] <TC_> I want to split via " " (space) but I don't want multiples.
[07:40:28] <TC_> "hello           word" should be "hello word" then split or something..
[07:40:30] <TC_> either before or after
[07:40:51] <felo> you want a space in between hello and word
[07:40:54] <xec> TC_: i forked your 5th version: http://jsfiddle.net/gW6gD/
[07:40:57] <dxgriffiths> Diverdude: Ok the problem here is that `this` is not an HTML element. Is it .basic that you want to target?
[07:41:20] <TC_> sweet.
[07:41:37] <ShawnRisk> :D
[07:42:11] <Diverdude> dxgriffiths, no i want to target .editbtn
[07:42:36] <felo> TC_: it is not priting the results to see the output
[07:42:50] <TC_> or this xec: http://jsfiddle.net/gW6gD/1/  So looks like I needed both. :) thanks guys.
[07:42:53] <TC_> felo, it would of been in the console
[07:43:09] <felo> ok
[07:43:27] <felo> ok yes the console has the value
[07:43:28] <felo> then
[07:44:23] <Diverdude> dxgriffiths, how can i do that?
[07:44:38] <dxgriffiths> Diverdude: will there be more than one?
[07:44:43] <Diverdude> dxgriffiths, yes
[07:44:50] <Diverdude> dxgriffiths, this is why i want to use this
[07:45:18] <Diverdude> dxgriffiths, i only want to unhide the .eitbtn for the current group
[07:45:22] <Diverdude> so to say
[07:45:23] <koskoz> hi
[07:46:10] <koskoz> I'm cloning an html block which is set to display: none and I'd like to make this block visible, but it seems that I can't chain "show()" to "clone()": $('.group').not(':visible').clone().show()
[07:46:12] <koskoz> any idea?
[07:46:18] <seutje> dxgriffiths: beware, it's very advanced, I was told
[07:46:44] <dxgriffiths> seutje: what was :) ?
[07:46:59] <systemfault> What is very advanced?
[07:47:01] <seutje> Diverdude's thingy
[07:47:08] <dxgriffiths> Diverdude: gimme 5.
[07:47:11] <Diverdude> is my thing advanced?
[07:47:12] <seutje> koskoz: append it to something?
[07:47:18] <seutje> Diverdude: that's what u said
[07:47:30] <Diverdude> seutje, i never said it was advanced
[07:47:31] <koskoz> seutje: $('.content').prepend($('.group').not(':visible').clone().show())
[07:48:08] <Diverdude> dxgriffiths, okay :) thx
[07:48:13] <seutje> Diverdude | seutje, please dont...seems to be a bit to advanced for you
[07:48:22] * xec is dizzy from looking at parens
[07:48:25] <seutje> koskoz: hmz
[07:48:27] <Diverdude> seutje, well that does not mean its advanced ;)
[07:48:41] <Diverdude> seutje, i dont know your level
[07:49:25] <TC_> how would I get the focussed input?
[07:49:28] <systemfault> Don't want to be mean but I don't think that anything related to jQuery can be advanced.. You're limited by what the DOM can do.
[07:49:31] <Diverdude> seutje, for some people its probably very easy
[07:49:31] <TC_> for instance I have multiple textfields. I need to select the one.
[07:49:45] <TC_> so if I select one, it's focussed... how do I grab the value of the focussed one?
[07:49:47] <Diverdude> seutje, for me it is advanced as well
[07:49:47] <TC_> if you understand me
[07:49:57] <xec> TC_: http://api.jquery.com/focus-selector/  ?
[07:50:02] <Diverdude> seutje, so dont be sad :)
[07:50:02] <seutje> holy ass quit triggering my highlighter with worthless crap
[07:50:29] <TC_> is(":focus") is what i'm after i think...
[07:50:52] <ShawnRisk> hmz?
[07:51:14] <seutje> koskoz: works fine here -> http://jsfiddle.net/seutje/EVSRQ/
[07:51:27] <TC_> can uyou break out of an $.each ?
[07:51:57] <seutje> "We can break the $.each() loop at a particular iteration by making the callback function return false"
[07:51:59] <seutje> docs 101
[07:52:04] <ShawnRisk> I am curious to know why my question got ignored is it just that I have no code?
[07:52:10] <Diverdude> dxgriffiths, any luck?
[07:52:38] <koskoz> seutje: it's because of the "show" which reset my element to its initial display, but since its initial display is set to "none" it couldn't work. I've used "css('display', 'block')" instead and its working fine
[07:53:00] <seutje> koskoz: see, this is why u paste a working testcase
[07:53:02] <felo> how can comepare one id found in a java variable to a php variable?
[07:53:05] <dxgriffiths> Diverdude: just trying to figure out how to get a reference back to the element.
[07:53:15] <xec> ShawnRisk: what did you ask?
[07:53:27] <ShawnRisk> how do I delay the first slide everytime it comes around in a slideshow?  I have tried delay and timeout with no luck.  I am using the jQuery Cycle Plugin.
[07:53:32] <seutje> please don't tell me he's still on that onSuccess callback shit, missing an argument?
[07:53:40] <koskoz> is it possible to know when the value of an input type=number is changed? Is there an event for that?
[07:54:14] <Diverdude> dxgriffiths, ahh yes ok. thats alsow where i got stuck
[07:54:17] <seutje> u mean like... the change event?
[07:54:17] <ShawnRisk> xec: ^
[07:54:58] <seutje> ShawnRisk: http://jquery.malsup.com/cycle/timeout.html
[07:55:02] <felo> ShanRisk: do you have an example ?
[07:55:17] <ShawnRisk> one sec
[07:55:19] <koskoz> seutje: changed is not only for the select?
[07:55:30] <koskoz> -d
[07:55:33] <seutje> what on earth would make u thing that? o.O
[07:55:37] <seutje> textfields never change?
[07:55:49] <seutje> ?mdc change
[07:55:53] <koskoz> I don't know why I was sure it was only for select
[07:56:01] <bot-t> seutje, XPCOM changes in Gecko 2.0 - MDC Docs - https://developer.mozilla.org/en/XPCOM/XPCOM_changes_in_Gecko_2.0
[07:56:01] <koskoz> that's why I asked here
[07:56:13] <seutje> ?mdc onchange
[07:56:13] <bot-t> seutje, element.onchange - MDC Docs - The onchange property sets and returns the onChange event handler code for the current element. https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/element.onchange
[07:56:16] <ShawnRisk> seutje: that is good, but I need this just for the first slide.
[07:56:45] <ShawnRisk> felo: yes
[07:56:47] <seutje> ShawnRisk: u get everything u need to determine what slide ur on and what slide ur going to
[07:57:02] <pilgo_> I have something strange happening. I have a class selector that for some reason doesn't work for elements that I add the class to using .addClass. Anyone want to take a stab at this?
[07:57:20] <gigo1980> hi all
[07:57:46] <dxgriffiths> Diverdude: what I'd try is to use (".basic").each(function() { var el = this; $(this).jRating..., might not be the best solution but it'd work.
[07:57:49] <gigo1980> what event should i have to insert into live, if an element is added to my dom
[07:58:01] <ShawnRisk> seutje: let me try
[07:58:10] <seutje> ShawnRisk: as if I could stop u
[07:58:21] <gigo1980> so i will jQuery('input').live('ready', function(){});
[07:58:37] <seutje> I'ma go before I start tearing my hair out
[07:58:42] <ShawnRisk> :P
[07:58:45] <Diverdude> dxgriffiths, hmm how would that give me to the current .editbtn?
[07:59:01] <Diverdude> dxgriffiths, "get me to"
[08:00:57] <dxgriffiths> Diverdude: if the button image is always the last child of .basic's previous sibling, you could get a reference to it by traversing backwards.
[08:02:32] <Diverdude> dxgriffiths, but there are many .basic on the page
[08:02:49] <Diverdude> dxgriffiths, how do i know which one is the current?
[08:03:07] <TC_> http://87.102.89.203/autotags/ when you type in, the console says... elem.ownerDocument is undefined
[08:03:09] <dxgriffiths> Right, but if you call .each then `this` will be each individual .basic
[08:03:10] <TC_> view source for js
[08:03:35] <Diverdude> dxgriffiths, but i should only switch a single one and not all of them
[08:04:15] <Diverdude> dxgriffiths, if i do as you suggested i will be traversing all the .basic's
[08:04:20] <Diverdude> i think
[08:04:28] <Diverdude> dxgriffiths, that was not my intention
[08:05:12] <Diverdude> dxgriffiths, i want to, based on the callback function (which is an ajax callback) select only the corresponding editbtn
[08:05:45] <dxgriffiths> Diverdude: what you do is $(".basic").each(function() { var myEditBtn = $(this).previous().last(); $(this).jRating({ onSuccess: function() { $(myEditBtn).show()
[08:06:52] <dxgriffiths> That's a sketch btw... don't use that exactly :)
[08:08:40] <TC_> oh i know why
[08:09:10] <foertel> keep getting "Uncaught RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded" with jQuery.event.remove with acutal jQueryUI and jQuery :(
[08:09:20] <TC_> nope.
[08:09:32] <TC_> for starters it had no parent, but i added that in but still not working
[08:11:12] <felo> how can I convert the value of a php variable into a javascript variable value?
[08:11:56] <ShawnRisk> I am not sure how to output the slideshow timeout to 10000 for the first slideshow and made the rest 2500?  Here: http://jquery.malsup.com/cycle/timeout.html
[08:12:09] <felo> How can I pass the value of a php variable into a javascript variable?
[08:12:37] <TC_> var JSVar = <?= $phpVar; ?>
[08:12:56] <felo> Thanks TC
[08:14:05] <felo> Does variables withing a javascript function dies out of the functions?
[08:14:53] <systemfault> If they've been declared with "var" (Like it should be) then yes.
[08:15:36] <foertel> no idea about the recursion in jQuery.event.remove in jquerui datepicker?
[08:15:39] <felo> Does variables within a javascript function dies out of the functions? for instance function(){ var inside =  $('#replyCommId') } then calling inside out of that function
[08:15:53] <lulzmachine> yo. how can I remove() a selector, but keep the contents of it? (i wand the form elements there, but the <form>-tag gone)
[08:15:55] <felo> systemfault: yes like that
[08:16:01] <felo> so I will have to redeclare the variable again?
[08:16:18] <TC_> ok, nevermind tht. getting closer.
[08:16:36] <felo> that's what is all about TC_
[08:16:47] <TC_> $($.inputFocused).parent().children(options.tagArea).delegate("a", "click", function() { this isn't doing it's thing. http://87.102.89.203/autotags/
[08:17:03] <ahandy> is there any way i could stop a plugin from working, such as one that zooms on images automatically or w/e? something like animate's .stop()
[08:17:07] <TC_> i've ot it so it's displayin tags to the related ... section but you can't click 'em
[08:17:07] <rgerrard> lookup local variables
[08:17:26] <felo> in jquery rgerrard?>
[08:17:45] <rgerrard> in general
[08:17:56] <rgerrard> local and global variables are not jquery specific
[08:18:26] <felo> ok
[08:18:39] <cerzi> hi all, i'm new to jquery and ajax in general, and am having trouble working out how to extract attributes from a json object returned from a $.post() call. i've got as far as json.results, but how can I extract specific named attributes from this?
[08:19:13] <cerzi> like, is there some way of simply reading attributes like json.results.name, or whatever?
[08:20:26] <anli_> You just use the . operator, yes
[08:20:37] <rgerrard> try json.results[0].name
[08:20:41] <anli_> I assume you pass the argument "json" after the function reference
[08:20:52] <anli_> Else, jquery will not interpret the result as json
[08:21:08] <cerzi> yeah, I'm using function(jason) {
[08:21:10] <cerzi> one sec, I'll try that
[08:21:13] <ahandy> is there any way i could stop a function completely? like destroy it (basically like animate's stop() just for functions) please help!
[08:21:15] <anli_> yeah, do that
[08:21:29] <anli_> ahandy: javascript is not multi threaded
[08:21:36] <ahandy> anli_: what do you mean?
[08:21:38] <anli_> Meaning that you cannot interrupt a function
[08:21:43] <anli_> There is nothing to interrupt
[08:21:57] <cerzi> Yeah when I use: json.results[0].average -> I get: Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property '0' of undefined
[08:21:59] <ahandy> anli_: i meant like if i started a plugin, such as zoomy(), and i want to stop it, how is that possible?
[08:22:02] <anli_> Are you talking about terminating a script?
[08:22:06] <anli_> hm
[08:22:31] <anli_> cerzi: try json[0]
[08:22:36] <ahandy> anli_: yes! how do i do that?
[08:22:48] <anli_> ahandy: you can always throw an exception that is not caught
[08:23:04] <ahandy> would that give an error?
[08:23:16] <anli_> In the error console, it will show up yes
[08:23:27] <cerzi> anli_: that throws "Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'results' of undefined".. hmmm
[08:23:37] <anli_> It also unwinds the current stack, but it may also be caught
[08:23:43] <ahandy> anli_: is there no other way to terminate a script?
[08:23:50] <anli_> cerzi: did you try json[0]?
[08:24:13] <anli_> ahandy: I do not have all information to really tell, its a jquery plugin, I assume
[08:24:34] <cerzi> anli_: on its own, theres no exception but the text printed to the page is: [object Object]
[08:24:43] <cerzi> similar to doing json.results
[08:24:45] <ahandy> anli_: yes, it's a plugin that enables zoom on an image, however i want to it to start when i click on a button, and stop when i click on another
[08:24:56] <anli_> ah, then json is an array
[08:25:05] <anli_> try to alert json.length
[08:25:28] <anli_> Hm, you can always put another image above the previous one
[08:25:35] <anli_> Then its not as easy to interact with it
[08:25:39] <ShawnRisk> seems no one can help me :(
[08:25:43] <TC_> hm
[08:25:48] <TC_> ok the problem is..
[08:26:01] <TC_> lets say I had <div><span><more tags here></span></div>
[08:26:05] <TC_> the amount of tags MAY depend.
[08:26:19] <ahandy> anli_: that doesnt work with what im doing :s you sure there's no way to terminate a script?
[08:26:28] <TC_> so it would be a use edit in order to do.. parent().parent().parent().parent() how ever many times it's needed
[08:26:30] <TC_> I'm not keen on that idea
[08:26:33] <TC_> anything simply i can do?
[08:26:49] <anli_> hm, maybe its not the easiest way to solve the problem, maybe you can just let the effects of the script running be zip
[08:26:55] <anli_> nothing
[08:27:09] <anli_> TC_: closest is what I use there
[08:27:11] <ahandy> anli_: not sure i understand :/
[08:27:17] <TC_> hm
[08:27:17] <anli_> TC_: foo.closest('.foobar');
[08:27:23] <TC_> ah
[08:27:24] <TC_> hm
[08:27:25] <cerzi> anli_: json.length -> "undefined" /confused
[08:27:25] <anli_> Then I use the class foobar on some outer element
[08:28:00] <anli_> cerzi: hm, maybe json is not an array after all, use firebug and put the keyword debugger; first in the event handler
[08:28:04] <TC_> would that go outside of the ... parents?
[08:28:14] <TC_> I mean.. if I had <div><span></span></div> ... twice
[08:28:19] <TC_> i dont' want the second divs to get the first?
[08:28:20] <anli_> TC_: It will search along the parent chain
[08:28:25] <TC_> ah ok
[08:28:59] <anli_> TC_: Its not very easy to understand what you are trying to do
[08:31:53] <TC_> Look at this anli_ http://87.102.89.203/autotags/ when you type something in and click a tag, it gets the parental div in order to spit it into the textbox. The code of that is simple, it's just.. <div id="tags1"><span class="tagArea"></span></div>
[08:32:03] <TC_> but someone, may come alon and want a list.. in order to make it look fancy
[08:32:09] <TC_> which means I would need more parents.
[08:32:12] <TC_> I tried a closest but it would work
[08:32:25] <anli_> you can probably do this without ids
[08:33:52] <TC_> most likely.
[08:33:56] <TC_> but how can I do with the id's I have lol
[08:34:19] <anli_> $('a').click(function(event){ var a =$(event).target; a.closest('div').find('input').val(a.text()); return false;});
[08:34:22] <anli_> I am not sure about it
[08:34:42] <anli_> Did not test run
[08:35:07] <ShawnRisk> any ideas on my question?
[08:35:15] <TC_> I'll try closest div
[08:35:17] <TC_> yeah
[08:35:21] <TC_> you have that lol
[08:35:57] <TC_> Ok, this works: if($(this).closest("div").attr("id") == $($.inputFocused).parent().attr("id"))
[08:36:00] <TC_> let me see if I can narrow it down.
[08:37:26] <TC_> boom
[08:37:29] <TC_> i think i got it
[08:38:01] <TC_> hahaha, yes thanks!
[08:38:48] <anli_> TC_: Aha, nice!
[08:38:55] <scar2> so on http://lucero.apt24.net , I have the datepicker installed textbook-- but i get errors saying Cannot call method 'datepicker' of null ....
[08:38:58] <ShawnRisk> I am not sure how to output the slideshow timeout to 10000 for the first slideshow and made the rest 2500?  Here: http://jquery.malsup.com/cycle/timeout.html
[08:39:17] <anli_> TC_: Using id:s are not nice :)
[08:39:29] <anli_> TC_: I try to stay away from that
[08:39:31] <TC_> wasn't originally for me anyway.
[08:39:35] <anli_> Aha
[08:39:36] <TC_> but yeah I probably don't need the id's..
[08:39:43] <TC_> but if someone had ... children divs...
[08:39:48] <TC_> it would cause an issue so I stuck in id's
[08:39:49] <anli_> of course not, but nice that you solved the problem
[08:40:19] <TC_> instead of the closest('div') it's more... closest('div#someid')
[08:40:28] <TC_> so all other children divs don't get effected by it
[08:42:20] <anli_> TC_: but then you can give the outmost div a class
[08:42:34] <anli_> <div class="outer"></div>, then you can use .closest('.outer')
[08:42:36] <scar2> does anyone know why id be getting 'uncaught typeerror:cannot call method 'datepicker' of null
[08:42:43] <scar2> i have all the filesi ncldues
[08:43:02] <anli_> Cant you call in on a div instead?
[08:43:17] <anli_> Or an input box
[08:44:38] <scar2> anli_ me?
[08:45:41] <anli_> yes
[08:46:00] <anli_> var div = $('#the_div_of_your_choice'); div.datepicker();
[08:50:10] <foertel> does datepicker work for all of you
[08:50:31] <foertel> can't believe i'm the only one with max call stack exceed at jQuery.event.remove
[08:50:44] <ahandy> how can i terminate a javascript script
[08:50:45] <foertel> just doing $('#startTimepicker').datepicker();
[08:50:51] <ahandy> like php's die()
[08:51:28] <scar2> fortel i cant get datepicker to work
[08:51:34] <scar2> using the same code that works on other pages
[08:51:34] <foertel> click, everything looks good, choose a date, date popup disappears, jqueryui starts to run into recursion with jQuery.event.remove
[08:52:03] <ShawnRisk> :(
[08:52:11] <scar2> anli_: so i need to make the DIV the id not hte input box?
[08:53:09] <foertel> div if you wanna use inline
[08:53:17] <foertel> input if you wanna use onClick popup
[08:54:01] <scar2> foertel: http://lucero.apt24.net -- giving me an error i dont understand.. the code works the same on another site
[08:54:20] <scar2> but that what im doing. and i dont understand the inline or onClick in this situation, as im not using either.
[08:54:32] <foertel> this is exactly my problem ;)
[08:54:33] <foertel> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6143579/memory-leak-using-jquery-ui-datepicker
[08:55:12] <scar2> ya thats not mine :P
[08:55:17] <scar2> this is so frustrating
[08:55:50] <ahandy> how can i terminate a script in js or jquery
[08:56:26] <foertel> ahandy: you do not want to do that
[08:56:32] <foertel> scar2: your selector is just wrong
[08:56:47] <scar2> foertel how so??
[08:56:51] <ahandy> foertel: i want to end a plugin from working :s how do i achieve that
[08:57:08] <foertel> ahandy: you do not want ;)
[08:57:18] <foertel> js is event based ... you do not want to terminate things
[08:57:31] <foertel> just do $('div#pluign').remove()
[08:57:33] <ahandy> foertel: then how am i supposed to make a plugin stop working when i click on a button?
[08:58:08] <foertel> scar2: don't knwo ;) just do $('input.datepicker').datepicker(); if your input field has class "datepicker"
[08:58:14] <ngharo> ?p @ ahandy
[08:58:14] <bot-t> ahandy, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js or http://fixee.org/
[08:59:06] <scar2> foertel: if the selector was wrong, then why would the same code work on a different page? what would cause this?
[08:59:36] <foertel> that the selector is not wrong on another page
[08:59:46] <foertel> because your inputs have other classes or ids or something
[08:59:50] <scar2> its an input with an id=""
[08:59:51] <scar2> hm
[08:59:58] <scar2> i took out the class as well
[09:00:02] <foertel> propably the id is used twice
[09:01:02] <scar2> its not though lol

[09:01:07] <felo> foertel: when I pass a php variable into javascript it throws off the rest of the code.
[09:01:21] <foertel> you do not want to do that :D
[09:01:21] <ahandy> foertel: basically it's an image, and then whenever someone click a START button, i start a plugin that zooms on the image onhover, now i want it to stop the plugin whenever soemeone click son another button, any idea?
[09:01:58] <felo> yes how can jam the pass the value of the php into java without having that
[09:02:11] <ahandy> foertel: then how am i supposed to stop it?
[09:02:29] <foertel> ahandy: is this you plugin
[09:02:35] <ngharo> ahandy: you unbind the event handlers
[09:02:36] <foertel> as you implemented start() just implement stop()
[09:02:52] <mofle> Where did all the Django podcasts go? Anyone know if there is still any active ones?
[09:02:57] <foertel> just look for what is happening when you start the plugin and then revertt
[09:03:15] <ShawnRisk> spam
[09:03:16] <ahandy> foertel: mind looking at the code and guiding me through it as it isnt my plugin?
[09:03:22] <foertel> yes ;)
[09:03:30] <foertel> it not my plugin either
[09:03:32] <ShawnRisk> seems no one can help me :(
[09:04:00] <foertel> okey ... heading of for HHjs ;)
[09:04:36] <scar2> something has to be clashing it and i cant figure out what
[09:05:12] <ngharo> ShawnRisk: setTimeout at 10s to start the cycle that has interval of 2s
[09:06:00] <ShawnRisk> ngharo: I just want the first slideshow to be 10s and the next to 2.5s
[09:06:31] <ngharo> yep, i think that should work
[09:06:53] <ngharo> ShawnRisk: setTimeout(function() { $('banana').cycle({speed: 2500}) }, 10000);
[09:07:12] <ShawnRisk> ngharo: I know that but did you look at the link?
[09:07:29] <ngharo> yes
[09:07:59] <scar2> Does anyone know why my datepicker wont work on a specific page? It says Cannot call method 'datepicker' of null
[09:08:04] <ngharo> using that calc function would work fine too
[09:08:14] <glen1> why does IE exist, my jquery code works for every browser except it :(
[09:08:16] <ngharo> if opts.currSlide === 1; return 10000
[09:09:12] <ngharo> scar2: your selector is incorrect
[09:09:29] <scar2> ngharo: but my selector is correct. the ID is unique
[09:09:41] <ngharo> or the content doesnt exist before you're trying to select it
[09:10:15] <ngharo> scar2: paste the same selector at the console, see if it returns the correct element or not
[09:10:27] <ShawnRisk> ngharo: how do I make the rest 2500?  As my speed is 10 at the moment
[09:10:54] <ngharo> if you're using that calctimeout function
[09:11:01] <ngharo> if opts.currSlide === 1; return 10000 ; else return 2500;
[09:11:13] <ngharo> somethin like that
[09:11:14] <scar2> how more specific can i get?? it stil says null but i mean, i have the $( "#datepicker_unique1" ).datepicker(); and theres only 1 ID with that name
[09:11:41] <ngharo> scar2: can you please take my suggestion.  try running $( "#datepicker_unique1" ) at the console
[09:12:23] <scar2> ngharo i did
[09:12:41] <scar2> i said it showed null
[09:13:13] <ngharo> ok then your selector is wrong

[09:17:53] <binarious> Hi. Is there a way to set css3 properties?
[09:17:55] <ngharo> all kinda relevant
[09:17:57] <glen1> ngharo, thanks, i found $.get that posts data
[09:18:11] <binarious> Like .css('-moz-transform') ?
[09:18:11] <ngharo> word
[09:18:23] <ngharo> binarious: yep that should work
[09:18:23] <scar2> ngharo: jsfiddle.net/qMjv9
[09:18:42] <Heshanh> hey guys, why is it that when i do $(".client_act_delete").click(function(){} on a checkbox to see if its being clicked or not it triggers it twice
[09:18:43] <scar2> the code works separately but i included teh whole body b/c something is clashing, andi t makes no sense to me
[09:19:07] <binarious> oh yes it does. thanks ngharo
[09:19:30] <scar2> ngharo a better one is http://lucero.apt24.net
[09:20:25] <Heshanh> anyone?
[09:20:29] <ShawnRisk> one sec
[09:21:07] <ShawnRisk> Heshanh: what about the id or class of the checkbox
[09:21:45] <Heshanh> id="" class is client_act_delete
[09:22:27] <Heshanh> im doing $(".client_act_delete").click(function(){ alter("a"); }). and it alerts twice
[09:22:42] <glen1> ngharo, so is it good practise to use window.location for when padding variables through index.php?foo=bar, Im using this for a delete button
[09:22:43] <felo> ngharo: in here I want to compare  button 101 id with the comment id 101 in a if statement to display form content. Should set the variables inside java or compare it with the POST values sent by the form?
[09:23:06] <felo> http://jsfiddle.net/xysxD/52/
[09:24:23] <ngharo> scar2: you're including two versions of jquery on that page
[09:24:49] <scar2> ngharo i can remove it, but the code works on a separate .html file with all the extra website gone from it
[09:25:34] <ngharo> ya remove it
[09:26:09] <binarious> what was the new javascript method for animations? the besser window.setInterval?
[09:26:33] <ngharo> you're setting onready functions via 1.5.1, then loading 1.4.4 which probably removes them
[09:27:28] <ngharo> glen1: messing with window.location isnt necessary if you're doing ajax

[09:29:10] <anli__> Ah, I know, I change the url to img.png?2 when I have edited the image
[09:30:01] <abjorn> hellloo
[09:30:18] <ngharo> scar2: i just realized you have prototype.js loaded in that page too.  It's overwriting $

[09:34:20] <shomon> is there a way to get a window to open in a tab?
[09:34:26] <ngharo> i dunno, you'd have to try it
[09:34:38] <binarious> seems not to work :(
[09:34:46] <notuo> Hello. I am a newbie hoping for help here. I have an issue with an animation. (I have 2 samples to show) The idea is to center some text within a container (gray in the example) which is animated. One example shows this but the size of the text is not computed, so is not centered properly. The other is centered fine but the animation is not well performed. (mainly is because of hidden the text): http://216.59.5.83/~talento/t1.html  a
[09:35:00] <ngharo> shomon: no, that's up to the browser to decide.  Most browsers do pop new windows in tabs by default tho?
[09:35:55] <ngharo> notuo: 404
[09:36:25] <notuo> hold a sec. I check
[09:37:42] <notuo> ngharo try again please.
[09:43:07] <ngharo> so in this example, the text isnt centering right?
[09:43:53] <notuo> ngharo, t1 the text is not centered but the animation is OK, t2, the text is centered but the animation is not fine
[09:44:07] <Heshanh> anyone know why is it when i do .click(function() on a chck box it trigger it twice?
[09:44:17] <notuo> ngharo the text should be vertically centered
[09:45:06] <scar2> how would i force the calendar to appear below the input box only?
[09:46:26] <ngharo> notuo: have you tried setting the centertext position:relative, and margin-top: 50%
[09:46:42] <ngharo> seems like you can accomplish this via css
[09:46:50] <steampunkey> hey. shouldn't a class added via addClass take precedence over the old ones? I have input[type=text].class defined, and then i have .new_class. I want to add the latter to an input type=text element to replace a styling from the former, but it fails.
[09:47:20] <notuo> ngharo Let me try that.
[09:47:47] <ngharo> notuo: else you may be getting bitten by height vs innerheight vs outerheight
[09:47:51] <ngharo> see http://jsfiddle.net/ngharo/Ag7wj/2/
[09:50:18] <notuo> ngharo. worked fine
[09:50:21] <k1ng> anyone here who is using WHMCS?
[09:50:52] <crankharder> I guess sortable() doesn't work on a table?
[09:51:19] <scar2> like make the datepicker calendar be on top always?
[09:51:22] <steampunkey> nvm, i'm using style now
[10:01:15] <notuo> ngharo. worked fine. Thank you very much.
[10:01:36] <ngharo> kewl
[10:13:18] <Acorn> Would the correct way to replace the contents of an element with other elements be to do: $('#container').html('').append(newcontent) ?
[10:13:28] <Diverdude> is it possible to get an array of all event handlers attached to a jquery object?
[10:15:05] <Acorn> or maybe .empty()?
[10:16:25] <ParadoxG> how do you dynamically declare a json identifier which is attached to a function?
[10:17:16] <ParadoxG> this does not work: {"click #block"+id: function()  {alert("Clicked!")}
[10:17:24] <ngharo> Diverdude: $('foo').data('events') iirc

[10:18:40] <Acorn> ngharo: with .html() you content would have to be a string though
[10:20:54] <ngharo> what is newcontent? a jq object?
[10:22:37] <crankharder> the draggable docs say taht an item being dragged gets the class 'ui-draggable-dragging' -- however, when using the sortable widget(which uses draggable) i dont see that class getting applied
[10:22:49] <crankharder> is it another class for sortable?  nothing in the docs on sortable about this
[10:26:32] <Diverdude> in my $(document).ready(function()) function i do $('.basic').jRating({..}) to create a jquery object for each node on the page which implements the .basic-class. Is it possible to remove this jquery object somehow and create a new one?

[10:48:46] <ngharo> codemagician: I cannot but I would suggest logging data to the console vs alert
[10:49:11] <amh345> i checked out jquerytools.. but i think that's a bit overkill

[10:49:56] <ngharo> then watch firebug/inspector console
[10:50:15] <amh345> ngharo: i saw that one. but it uses the typical browser scroller.  im looking for something that will allow me to customize the actual scrollbar.

[10:58:26] <codemagician> ngharo, i just spotted it as you wrote it
[10:58:41] <codemagician> ngharo, been staring at it for too long
[10:58:47] <ngharo> hehe
[10:59:45] <Pet^Aw> hi, it is possible to pass the value "width" of a ui-progressbar with the return value of a $post() call ??
[11:01:07] <codemagician> how to I get my event to write my result into a hidden value within my HTML form please
[11:01:07] <ngharo> you can get the value via $('#element').progressbar('value')
[11:01:08] <codemagician> ?
[11:01:14] <ngharo> then do anything you want with it
[11:01:45] <ngharo> codemagician: hidden input..
[11:02:21] <ngharo> ?val @ codemagician

[11:02:28] <THC4k> hey, im using a html5 video element and opera says i can do `var video = document.getElementsByTagName('video')[0]; video.play();`. Can i do the same when i create the video element in jquery?
[11:02:31] <Pet^Aw> ngharo, hi... i need to set the value after a $post() call
[11:03:27] <ngharo> Pet^Aw: so call $('#element').progressbar('value', SOMEVALUE); in the post callback
[11:03:57] <ngharo> THC4k: it'd look like var = $('video').get(0); video.play() in jquery
[11:04:14] <ngharo> or $('video')[0]
[11:04:26] <codemagician> ngharo, that's the getting the value, but how about setting it from jquery into the current HTML page?
[11:04:57] <ngharo> val is both a getter and a setter
[11:04:58] <ngharo> read the docs
[11:05:18] <THC4k> I do `newvid = $('<video ...>'); newvid.appendTo('somebox'); newvid.play();` but it says `newvid.play is not a function`
[11:05:50] <ngharo> that's because you need to call play() on the DOM node
[11:05:54] <ngharo> what you have there is a jquery object
[11:05:58] <ngharo> ?get @ THC4k
[11:05:58] <bot-t> THC4k, .get([index]): Retrieve the DOM elements matched by the jQuery object. http://api.jquery.com/get/
[11:06:02] <Pet^Aw> ngharo, ok, and if i want to set the value directly in the: jQuery(".progressbar-1 .ui-progressbar-value").animate({width : AFTER-POST-CALL}, 2000);  ?? it is possible ??
[11:06:33] <ngharo> Pet^Aw: i believe progressbar does the animating for you
[11:06:35] <THC4k> ngharo: ah great that's what i was looking for, thanks
[11:06:42] <ngharo> read the docs and look at the 'methods' tab
[11:07:02] <Pet^Aw> ngharo, ok
[11:07:24] <ngharo> Pet^Aw: you just set the value and progressbar does the rest afaik

[11:36:16] <Xaevo> e.g. www.google.com resolves to 74.125.79.147
[11:36:20] <no-gooder> Xaevo, you mean like 123.123.123.123 - www.google.com ?
[11:36:27] <no-gooder> ok:)
[11:36:29] <teknoid> Xaevo: why do you need client-side detection... use php?
[11:36:57] <Xaevo> so you enter www.google.com, press a button and then the value of the textbox changes to 74.125.79.147
[11:37:04] <Xaevo> teknoid: i don't want to refresh
[11:37:08] <no-gooder> ok, what is the problem ?
[11:37:16] <no-gooder> use ajax
[11:37:30] <no-gooder> if the problem is refreshing
[11:37:40] <Xaevo> jQuery can do what i want rite?
[11:37:44] <ngharo> ?post @ Xaevo
[11:37:44] <bot-t> Xaevo, jQuery.post(url, [data], [success], [dataType]): Load data from the server using a HTTP POST request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.post/
[11:37:45] <teknoid> Xaevo: imo, it's safer to determine IP on server side.
[11:38:01] <no-gooder> Xaevo, yes it can
[11:38:08] <teknoid> .. and pass it to the client... as others posted
[11:38:22] <Xaevo> teknoid: don't wanna reload...
[11:38:31] <teknoid> Xaevo: ajax dude ;)
[11:38:44] <Xaevo> so...jQuery != AJAX?
[11:39:18] <no-gooder> Xaevo,  jquery supports ajax.
[11:39:24] <Xaevo> ah..
[11:39:27] <no-gooder> post /  get
[11:39:29] <Xaevo> so, what's jQuery then?
[11:39:36] <teknoid> Xaevo: no... jQuery === ( 'simplified JS access' || 'ajax' || 'effects' || 'widgets');
[11:39:39] <no-gooder> javascript library
[11:40:50] <geestring> I have a fairly simple time table like this: http://pastebin.com/8Eqk8ZPV   What would be the best way of putting events on the timetable? How would I have a 7:00am to 10:30am event go down multiple rows?
[11:41:53] <gnarf> geestring: rowspan?
[11:42:17] <gnarf> geestring: things are going to get a little confusing though, I'll tell you that much
[11:42:56] <teknoid> geestring: what exactly do you mean by "events"?
[11:43:13] <geestring> well if there's an event i want it to de displayed...
[11:43:25] <geestring> basically a rectangle going down a column
[11:43:35] <geestring> and text within the rectangle
[11:43:49] <geestring> but right now they are all separate cells.
[11:43:59] <geestring> that's why im not sure how to approach this
[11:44:25] <teknoid> geestring: figure out on the server what falls into the right set of rows... and assign a class.
[11:44:29] <teknoid> the rest is css
[11:45:12] <ngharo> imo i would convert the data to ical and pass it to a calendar
[11:45:53] <geestring> yes i know I can do that... but use rowspan?
[11:47:42] <teknoid> geestring: why rowspan? ... class="event-0700-1030"... what else would you need?
[11:49:08] <geestring> ok if i append text to that class what will happen? will it treat that chunk of cells as one container?
[11:50:24] <geestring> let's say i applied a border to that class, wouldnt it just create borders around each cell?
[11:51:34] <kamarad> hello
[11:51:36] <teknoid> geestring: that's really a css question. and will depend on the browser.
[11:52:29] <kamarad> i have a question that is asked everywhere but seems to be have no answer : how can i modify in place a xml document  ?
[11:53:28] <teknoid> kamarad: that question warrants a book of answers... and follow-up questions, that's why it's not answered anywhere in one sentence ;)
[11:55:18] <kamarad> teknoid: thx for your answer, I can be more specific : i have a received a xml from google spreadsheet api and would like to modify it before send it as a PUT request. My problem is that i don't know how to modify any node (only read them)
[11:56:08] <geestring> i've never seen any browser treat a chunk of cells with the same class as if it were a rowspan
[11:56:10] <teknoid> kamarad: i'm sure there are some libraries that deal with xml... why with jQuery?
[11:56:29] <ngharo> kamarad: you can append(), text(), etc on XML docs
[11:56:37] <ngharo> same as you would any other HTML doc
[11:57:04] <kamarad> ngharo: it does not seem to modify anything on the xml
[11:57:16] <teknoid> geestring: .some-class {border 1px solid red;} ? doesn't work
[11:57:27] <teknoid> *minus the syntax issue
[11:58:34] <geestring> yes. That's what im trying to figure out. I guess rowspan would be too messy to do dynamically
[11:59:00] <teknoid> geestring: rowspan reminds me of 1996. it was a fun year ;)
[11:59:52] <ngharo> geestring: its going to be messy no matter which way you do it.  What if you have two events during the same timespan? what about four?
[12:00:00] <ngharo> quite an undertaking imo
[12:00:46] <ngharo> i've used projects like phpiCalendar to render out my events for me
[12:01:22] <geestring> each column will be a room
[12:01:38] <geestring> one column can't have overlapping events
[12:02:24] <ngharo> so just use rowspan then like gnarf suggested
[12:03:01] <gnarf> http://events.jquery.org/2011/sf-bay-area/schedule/ --- rowspans...
[12:03:49] <geestring> yea i want something like that
[12:05:49] <DoctorDarren> Hey, does anybody know, with jCarousel, can you go directly to a specified item, or can you only go next/previous to get there?
[12:07:09] <ngharo> yes you can
[12:07:16] <ngharo> there is a demo showing this
[12:07:54] <Fogin[Work]> any one here good with Jquery and coldfusion Custom tages
[12:08:04] <DoctorDarren> ngharo: Thanks I'll have a look thru them
[12:08:46] <DoctorDarren> got it! :D
[12:09:21] <dtach> BinaryKitten: Hi, are you there? remember me?
[12:10:18] <TC_> http://87.102.89.203/autotags/ view the source, when I comment out the he comment line (see near the bottom) ... none of it will work
[12:10:19] <TC_> :(
[12:10:54] <TC_> wonderin why
[12:10:55] <TC_> ?
[12:12:44] <dtach> for one your jquery.js isnt loading
[12:13:13] <dtach> use https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.6.1/jquery.min.js for example
[12:13:53] <TC_> it actually does load... the first textbox, if you typed in l
[12:13:56] <TC_> it comes up with languages etc
[12:14:15] <TC_> so not sure what you're lookin at :/
[12:15:27] <dtach> :p oh not here
[12:15:33] <dtach> might be my conn
[12:16:05] <TC_> probably.
[12:16:16] <TC_> Considering I'd certainly notice if it was loaded or not
[12:16:16] <TC_> :P
[12:16:31] <dtach> haah no doubt
[12:16:44] <TC_> but you should be looking around : $("#tags1").autoTags({
[12:16:50] <TC_> autoTags is something I made.
[12:16:57] <TC_> therei s $("#tags2").autoTags({ too
[12:17:02] <TC_> different id's and classes so they didn't conflict.
[12:17:04] <TC_> or whateve
[12:18:06] <impi> mmm im not sure how to ask this, but if i have data on my page, (a form) and I want it to apear insde a div, yet the data cant be inside this div because the div is inside another form, how will i "bring that data into this div?"
[12:19:40] <impi> if i can show you www.micket.me - just add a product to cart, and click checkout, on checkout youll get a jquery tools overlay, just click on allready have an account tab...and then on the "Already registered? Click here to login." link, how will i get the resulting popups data into the original overlay?
[12:20:10] <TC_> any other ideas dtach
[12:20:53] <ngharo> TC_: can you uncomment tags2 or whatever to make it fail
[12:21:01] <TC_> ok
[12:21:10] <TC_> done
[12:21:14] <TC_> no errors though thats the thing
[12:21:26] <TC_> lol ok thats new
[12:21:28] <TC_> the first won't done work
[12:21:31] <TC_> the second one does
[12:21:35] <teknoid> impi: no overlay for me
[12:22:05] <impi> teknoid, uhm, you should get an over lay if your not singed in,
[12:22:20] <impi> did you add a product to cart? and then clicked on the green checkout button?
[12:22:32] <teknoid> impi: added item, clicked checkout... no overlay
[12:22:43] <impi> IE?
[12:23:21] <teknoid> impi: ff ... ok i see now... i was on cart page... had to click "show my cart"... (a little  confusing, since i am looking at the cart)
[12:23:23] <impi> sorry mate, i deved it to give an overlay, so this is strange to me, and i wasnt planning on taking up your time too much, so i must apologise,
[12:23:23] <TC_> would be wise to specify the browser and the version ;)
[12:23:39] <impi> sorry bro, didnt mean to hassle you
[12:24:01] <impi> but you see the popup, i want that data inside of my overlay on the second tab
[12:24:28] <teknoid> impi: the modal can put data via ajax. i hope your cart is server-side
[12:24:35] <impi> yes it is
[12:24:40] <impi> magento
[12:24:49] <TC_> any ideas why the first one isn't working, ngharo
[12:24:55] <teknoid> impi: configure your dialog to pull data from the server.
[12:25:15] <impi> okay let me check it out, thank you, im using jquery tools so i should find it,
[12:25:26] <teknoid> impi: definitely available
[12:26:13] <impi> sometimes a fresh pair of eyes makes the world of difference, im still deving the site so it's not done yet
[12:26:14] <ngharo> TC_: for (key in bits) -> for (var key in bits)
[12:26:17] <Fogin[Work]> http://pastebin.com/RcgCqY6P how do i stop it from submiting to the window and keep it in the Dialog div , coldfusion/jquery-ui
[12:26:18] <ngharo> try that
[12:26:26] <teknoid> impi: p.s. having to require login is a huge conversion rate killer... just food for thought.
[12:26:51] <TC_> Nope :(
[12:27:10] <d4rklit3> hi
[12:27:11] <impi> teknoid, thanks man, see here is the goal. i did allow guest checkout, but i want to take advantage of FB social so i kinda wanna force the guy to click that FB button
[12:27:20] <d4rklit3> is there any way using ajax/jquery to remove a query from the address bar
[12:27:30] <impi> what i do is RSVP the buyer for the event too via fb graph api
[12:27:30] <TC_> ah there is two bits
[12:27:48] <TC_> nope
[12:27:51] <TC_> doesn't work still
[12:27:52] <impi> well i can allow guest checkout also...but just kinda obscure it
[12:28:08] <impi> thanks for your advice though
[12:28:13] <TC_> it looks as if it's not creating two object things
[12:28:17] <TC_> but instad overwriting the first?
[12:28:19] <TC_> could i be right
[12:28:28] <teknoid> impi: i got you. depends on how you build your bottom line... (was going to say, if conversion is something you care about make it less obvious, but still possible for guests to checkout)
[12:28:50] <impi> thanks hey, much appreicate your input
[12:29:40] <ngharo> TC_: im not the best person to ask about plugins, but you're using quite a few globals
[12:29:44] <ngharo> i'd try to avoid those
[12:29:48] <TC_> you mean the ..
[12:29:51] <TC_> $.variable ?
[12:30:56] <ngharo> yeah
[12:31:31] <TC_> ok should of sorted htem out. now.
[12:31:35] <TC_> it's var variable now
[12:31:47] <TC_> but still not working
[12:33:04] <TC_> Anyone else? http://87.102.89.203/autotags/ the second plugin of autotags works, but not the first. The code for the plugin init thing is near the bottom fo the source.
[12:33:57] <TC_> oh
[12:33:57] <TC_> got it
[12:34:02] <TC_> it was one of those globals ngharo
[12:34:15] <TC_> i had missed a function ^_^
[12:35:30] <ngharo> ahh cool
[12:35:38] <dtach> indeed =D works fine here
[12:35:51] <ngharo> yeah i was debugging and inputFocused kept coming back as null for tag1
[12:46:07] <TC_> Hey lettuce, where is cabbage?
[12:47:45] <ZeuZ> How can I set a <textarea> to be allways at the bottom?
[12:47:50] <crankharder> how do I say that a value isn't blank?
[12:47:55] <crankharder> val() != '' ?
[12:48:00] <TC_> ya
[12:48:04] <TC_> or whatever variable contains your value
[12:48:36] <TC_> What do you mean ZeuZ?
[12:48:39] <TC_> the scrollbar?
[12:48:57] <ZeuZ> TC_, yes, have it allways be at the bottom
[12:49:06] <TC_> ?scrollHeight
[12:49:08] <bot-t> TC_, IE 7 scroll height sometimes broken | jQuery Plugins - I have a page on which the IE 7 behavior exhibits broken scrolling. This exhibits as the pulldown being longer than the window; at the very least it doesn't respect the scrollheight parameter. It w... http://plugins.jquery.com/content/ie-7-scroll-height-sometimes-broken
[12:49:09] <TC_> does it work..
[12:49:11] <TC_> awww
[12:49:38] <Jayflux> who broke jsfiddle then
[12:50:18] <d4rklit3> dumb question:  padding in css does control if there is whiet space around the document

[12:50:34] <TC_> ?scrollTop
[12:50:35] <bot-t> .scrollTop(): Get the current vertical position of the scroll bar for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/scrollTop/
[12:50:39] <TC_> there we go :)
[12:50:44] <TC_> you can use that, ZeuZ
[12:50:47] <ZeuZ> is there a scrollBottom()? :)
[12:50:57] <TC_> scrollTop handles it
[12:51:02] <TC_> don't be fulled, it doesn't actually go to the top
[12:51:16] <TC_> $("#div").scrollTop($("#div").prop('scrollHeight'));
[12:51:19] <TC_> something similar to that
[12:51:31] <TC_> it won't be bounded to the bottom
[12:51:44] <TC_> you would need to recall it... maybe on a keyup event.
[12:51:56] <TC_> so it gets the new value and scrolls to the bottom
[12:52:22] <geestring> is there a function that automatically converts the Date object time to am/pm?
[12:53:20] <ngharo> doubtful
[12:53:25] <ngharo> you have to calc it
[12:53:27] <ngharo> +/-12hrs
[12:54:11] <geestring> ah ok thanks
[12:55:04] <ZeuZ> TC_, I've bounded it to a setInterval, however setting the prop after new text is added causes the value of the <textarea> to be set to ''? why's that?
[12:55:26] <TC_> I'm not sure at all
[12:56:22] <ZeuZ> suppose then I'd like to use .scrollTop(), to signal the bottom should I use .scrollTop(0);?
[12:56:46] <ngharo> 0 is top
[12:56:56] <TC_> I was just about to say something like that.
[12:56:57] <ngharo> use 9999 or some large value
[12:57:02] <TC_> lol
[12:57:06] <TC_> i suppose that would work
[13:07:43] <gigamonkey> I do $('body').keypress(<somefunction>) and it works the way I expect (somefunction is called each time I hit a key) in Chrome. But in firefox I get no events. Am I missing something?
[13:31:40] <stefancrs> is there a way to get a callback on if _anything_ in a form changes?
[13:32:23] <stefancrs> oh
[13:32:24] <stefancrs> heh
[13:32:26] <stefancrs> nevermind
[13:34:41] <dtach> when using jquery UI's autocomplete with my array of post titles it doesnt seem to work how i expect it to, when i for example type A, i get all posts, when i type All— i get a post title that has Falls in it. How can i set it up so it only takes the firstl etter of the post
[13:35:01] <dtach> so A = A post about cars / a post about stuff
[13:35:06] <dtach> :P hard to give an example
[13:35:23] <dtach> the array's contents isnt alphabetical, is that a problem? anything i can do
[13:35:35] <pifantastic> dtach: http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/#option-minLength
[13:35:53] <pifantastic> Set that to 0
[13:36:11] <dtach> ok let me try that thanks
[13:36:17] <tehOPEologist> can someone help me figure out why my navbar dropdown isn't fading out when your mouse leaves the div?  http://www.xecorporation.net/vision360
[13:37:42] <pilgo> I have issues with this code: http://jsfiddle.net/Pgw4J/ . Once "vote down" is clicked, "vote up" should changed the class to "vote_up" and then do an ajax request when clicked. However that's not happening. Any clues?
[13:37:42] <bot-t> (11 hours 50 mins ago) <coldhead> tell pilgo seriously you are so welcome, i can't even begin to tell you
[13:37:53] <stefancrs> tehOPEologist: I take it you don't want your site to work well on touch screen devices? :)
[13:38:11] <pilgo> bot-t: I missed something....
[13:38:12] <tehOPEologist> how would you suggest i code it then?
[13:38:12] <bot-t> pilgo, Pines Notify | jQuery Plugins - Pines Notify is a Growl like notification plugin. http://plugins.jquery.com/project/pnotify
[13:38:14] <pifantastic> pilgo: you're mouseout looks weird
[13:38:50] <tehOPEologist> stefancrs: how would you suggest i code it then?
[13:38:54] <pilgo> pifantastic: Not sure what you mean.
[13:39:10] <stefancrs> tehOPEologist: if you want it to work well on touch screen devices? skip stuff that uses hovering (like mouse position instead of clicks), and don't use a fixed width design
[13:39:18] <dtach> pifantastic: sadly that didnt fix it, the array is not alphabetical would that matter?
[13:39:26] <pifantastic> $('#explore_dropdown').delay(500),
[13:39:40] <pifantastic> pilgo: I think you want to chain there, but instead you have a comma
[13:39:43] <tehOPEologist> well, that's how the designer wants it, so i'm just coding what he wants..
[13:39:55] <pifantastic> oh shit
[13:39:59] <pifantastic> im getting crowsswird again
[13:40:00] <stefancrs> tehOPEologist: asked him if he wants the site to suck on a mobile phone? :)
[13:40:03] <tehOPEologist> how do you suggest i get it to fade out though?  what am i missing?
[13:40:07] <pifantastic> pilgo: that was meant for tehOPEologist
[13:40:18] <tehOPEologist> well, that's his mistake, and he
[13:40:23] <tehOPEologist> *he'll bite the bullet
[13:40:23] <pilgo> pifantastic: pheww. ok
[13:40:30] <pifantastic> tehOPEologist: $('#explore_dropdown').delay(500),
[13:40:31] <tehOPEologist> i'm on a time schedule since he got this to me yesterday
[13:40:40] <pifantastic> Dont you want to chain your function calls there?
[13:40:57] <tehOPEologist> i just want to get one working first, then i guess i'll chain the others after?
[13:41:31] <pilgo> Anyone know how I can get the log of this room?
[13:41:52] <pifantastic> tehOPEologist: Im saying, "$('#explore_dropdown').fadeOut(500);" will *never* execute
[13:42:09] <tehOPEologist> oh, because it's false?
[13:42:12] <pifantastic> it is inside an anonymous function that never executes
[13:42:14] <tehOPEologist> and i start it saying it's false?
[13:42:18] <tehOPEologist> o
[13:42:48] <pifantastic> read that code carefully
[13:42:54] <pifantastic> I dont think it does what you think it does
[13:43:29] <tehOPEologist> it waits half a second, then does the if function?
[13:43:31] <tehOPEologist> O_o;;
[13:43:37] <tehOPEologist> that's how i wanted it to work, anyways..
[13:44:24] <pifantastic> tehOPEologist: it waits a half second.  That's it! because you have a COMMA between the delay and that anonymous function
[13:44:31] <tehOPEologist> OH
[13:44:40] <pilgo> coldhead: Ok, I think I missed something huge from you :(
[13:44:40] <tehOPEologist> can i chain it with another period?
[13:44:55] <tehOPEologist> so i'd delay(500).function() { blahblahblah
[13:44:55] <tehOPEologist> ?
[13:45:08] <pifantastic> no
[13:45:14] <tehOPEologist> aw.
[13:45:15] <tehOPEologist> :(
[13:45:15] <pifantastic> delay(500, function() {
[13:45:20] <pifantastic> you're close
[13:45:23] <tehOPEologist> hm, ok
[13:45:27] <tehOPEologist> one sec, thank you!
[13:45:31] <tehOPEologist> gonna see if i can go from there

[13:49:55] <bot-t> (21 hours 50 mins ago) <abjorn> tell imsky hi
[13:50:04] <abjorn> :D
[13:50:08] <imsky> lololol
[13:50:11] <imsky> soup abjorn
[13:50:13] <stefancrs> hm
[13:50:20] <abjorn> nm, finishing up some changes to a clients website
[13:50:28] <imsky> how handy
[13:50:36] <abjorn> I know, right?
[13:50:43] <stefancrs> I hook up a $('.classname').change(alert('yo!')); within a form
[13:50:44] <imsky> right
[13:50:45] <stefancrs> and have selects that have that class
[13:50:57] <pifantastic> tehOPEologist: I dont think your logic here is right
[13:50:57] <imsky> lololol
[13:50:58] <stefancrs> but nothing happens when I change the selectors
[13:51:07] <imsky> what are .classname, stefancrs ?
[13:51:10] <imsky> are they
[13:51:11] <imsky> inputs
[13:51:11] <imsky> dis
[13:51:13] <imsky> divs*
[13:51:14] <imsky> labels
[13:51:16] <stefancrs> imsky: inputs
[13:51:17] <imsky> <crap>?
[13:51:22] <stefancrs> or, no
[13:51:24] <stefancrs> selects
[13:51:27] <imsky> 0_o
[13:51:28] <pifantastic> tehOPEologist: If I mouseout of #topnav_explore, it's going to hide the explore nav even if my mouse is OVER the explore nav
[13:51:42] <ngharo> stefancrs: wrap your alert in an anonymous function
[13:51:52] <DEac-> "$('.classname').change(alert('yo!'));"? this can't be right.
[13:52:04] <systemfault> Indeed.
[13:52:07] <stefancrs> ngharo: it used to be a function, didn't make a difference
[13:52:30] <ngharo> $('.classname').change(function() { alert('changed'); })
[13:52:40] <imsky> stefancrs: http://jsfiddle.net/dSEBa/
[13:53:04] <stefancrs> hm
[13:53:05] <stefancrs> wtf
[13:53:18] <stefancrs> I put it in an anonymous and that works
[13:53:25] <stefancrs> previously I called a member function, and that didnt' work
[13:53:30] <stefancrs> so I probably did something else wrong
[13:53:48] <imsky> yes
[13:53:58] <stefancrs> it all works nwo
[13:53:59] <stefancrs> now
[13:54:03] <tehOPEologist> oh, pifantastic i think i know what you're saying
[13:54:05] <stefancrs> I wonder what I changed
[13:54:06] <stefancrs>  :)
[13:54:06] <ngharo> stefancrs: because the way you had it before, alert gets called and the return value of that gets passed as the change handler
[13:54:08] <tehOPEologist> i wrote this at 3am last night
[13:54:15] <tehOPEologist> i'm starting to see how tired i really was rofl
[13:54:17] <imsky> abjorn: what's your client project?
[13:54:21] <stefancrs> ngharo: yeah, I get that, but before that, I had a function in there
[13:54:32] <abjorn> imsky: http://inplainenglish.biz/
[13:54:35] <stefancrs> ngharo: as in this.function
[13:54:35] <abjorn> just finished up
[13:54:42] <imsky> did you design
[13:54:43] <tehOPEologist> cuz i'm saying that when i mouseout of the button on the nav, to fade the dropdown
[13:54:45] <imsky> or do jquery
[13:54:57] <abjorn> I did everything except the design
[13:55:00] <abjorn> no javascript, actually
[13:55:08] <imsky> well that's good, cause the design is jank lolol
[13:55:21] <abjorn> *shrug* it's alright
[13:55:28] <stefancrs> I want more responsive design :(
[13:55:38] <imsky> it's actually really good for the first half of the page
[13:55:41] <stefancrs> and I'd like to do sites with responsive design
[13:55:44] <imsky> and then it's just a typographical nightmare
[13:55:55] <dtach> i fix my array with sort(), how can i make it so that the autocomplete checks the first letters of all the entries, not search through the entire thing?
[13:56:06] <stefancrs> http://mediaqueri.es/popular/ <- I cry
[13:56:27] <imsky> stefancrs: lrn2mediaquery?
[13:56:29] <imsky> or something
[13:56:33] <stefancrs> haha
[13:56:39] <abjorn> imsky: actually yeah that's something I need to fix it. I got lazy in that part and didn't match it to the psd design well enough
[13:56:48] <imsky> abjorn: yeah, white text on orange?
[13:56:49] <imsky> lolol
[13:56:55] <imsky> TOTALLY LEGIBLE
[13:57:06] <abjorn> I think I'm going to do what I did on the other pages: black on white lol
[13:57:08] <stefancrs> imsky: http://www.designmadeingermany.de/magazin/5/ <- I love that one, both from a responsive point of view, but also what the background does when you scroll the page etc. clean shit.
[13:57:10] <imsky> wooo
[13:58:03] <imsky> stefancrs: while fixed backgrounds are pretty rad, ehhh
[13:58:24] <stefancrs> imsky: it's that it's not one fixed background and how it works in conjunction with the content
[13:58:28] <imsky> woo unmodified clipart
[13:58:29] <imsky> woo
[13:58:43] <ngharo> imsky is not pleased
[13:58:49] <imsky> i am feeling underwhelmed
[13:59:01] <stefancrs> it's a fricking awesome design :)
[13:59:14] <imsky> yes, it is technically and from a layout perspective impressive
[13:59:22] <imsky> too bad it's mostly words and unmodified clipart
[13:59:40] <stefancrs> unless I have seen the clipart before, that does not matter
[13:59:47] <imsky> 0_o
[13:59:52] <stefancrs> it's the composition, I don't care who made the kittehs
[13:59:55] <imsky> you have a strange standard for artistic creativity lol
[14:00:06] <stefancrs> how so?
[14:00:14] <stefancrs> someone made the kittehs, they're quite nice
[14:00:26] <imsky> hmm
[14:00:37] <imsky> i'm inclined to talk about utkin or kral
[14:00:43] <stefancrs> does it matter who made them? does it have to be the same guy that does the entire site? :)
[14:00:59] <imsky> do we have to get paid for our work?
[14:01:00] <imsky> lololol
[14:01:08] <imsky> let's just remix everything!
[14:01:19] <stefancrs> if you do it well...
[14:01:20] <stefancrs> :)
[14:01:49] <imsky> the front page actually looks better
[14:01:52] <imsky> http://www.designmadeingermany.de/
[14:03:46] <abjorn> imsky: ah there we go, now it looks better I think :D
[14:04:00] <imsky> abjorn: bro i loves ya, but no
[14:04:05] <abjorn> IT'S BETTER
[14:04:10] <abjorn> it's legible
[14:04:12] <imsky> lol
[14:04:17] <imsky> if the client doesn't complain
[14:04:18] <imsky> sure
[14:04:20] <abjorn> I'm not a designer
[14:04:22] <abjorn> so fuck it
[14:04:27] <imsky> ya fuck it
[14:04:29] <imsky> we'll do it live
[14:04:34] <stefancrs> what did the psd look like? :)
[14:04:57] <imsky> abjorn: why are you doing layout anyway, if you're not a designer
[14:05:06] <stefancrs> put some placekitten.com on it
[14:05:07] <imsky> sounds like.....<scope><creep></creep></scope>
[14:05:56] <abjorn> imsky: I did this site like over a year ago, but he needed some changes to it, and some stuff needed to be removed, and some of the stuff in the design just didn't make sense any more
[14:06:14] <imsky> oh for sho
[14:06:52] <ravenzz> this is nice http://squaredeye.com/
[14:07:12] <abjorn> see I wish I could do that kind of stuff haha
[14:07:13] <ravenzz> replace the whale with a kitten and you are done
[14:07:15] <ravenzz> lol
[14:07:18] <imsky> lol
[14:07:19] <abjorn> design: the bane of my existence
[14:07:30] <abjorn> MY FATAL WEAKNESS
[14:07:35] <imsky> it's ok
[14:07:38] <abjorn> it's like kryptonite for me
[14:07:41] <imsky> there's like a 1000 of them in austin
[14:07:56] <abjorn> correction, there's 1000 people in austin who think they are designers
[14:08:00] <abjorn> like 100 actual designers
[14:08:08] <imsky> harsh bro
[14:08:12] <abjorn> lol
[14:08:24] <abjorn> well, every hipster and artist thinks he can be a designer
[14:08:29] <stefancrs> ravenzz: on a big screen, yeah
[14:08:32] <abjorn> hipster/artist, it's a fine line
[14:08:42] <imsky> i think the line's pretty thick
[14:08:51] <imsky> no?
[14:09:02] <abjorn> nope
[14:09:04] <stefancrs> most hipsters I know are not artists...
[14:09:10] <stefancrs> as in know OF
[14:09:19] <abjorn> go to an art school and you'll be like "wow everyone here is either a hipster or a lesbian"
[14:09:23] <imsky> yeah i don't think there's a fine line between the two at all
[14:09:31] <imsky> one engages in artistry as a pastime, a costume
[14:09:35] <imsky> the other does it basically for life
[14:09:42] <abjorn> oh no it doesn't work the other way around, not every hipster is an artist or anything
[14:09:50] <abjorn> but a lot of artists are hipsters
[14:09:58] <stefancrs> abjorn: that does not mean all hipsters goes to art school
[14:10:03] <imsky> hmmm
[14:10:04] <imsky> correction
[14:10:06] <imsky> yes it does
[14:10:07] <abjorn> I didn't say they did
[14:10:18] <imsky> BFAs and MFAs are disproportionately hip lol
[14:10:22] <abjorn> lol
[14:10:32] * imsky lives in a liberal college town
[14:10:34] * imsky knows
[14:10:34] <stefancrs> abjorn: of there's a fine line, it has to go both ways
[14:10:49] <abjorn> WHATEVR you get what I mean
[14:10:51] <abjorn> whatever, even
[14:10:54] <imsky> wateva watvea
[14:10:57] <imsky> i do wat ai want
[14:11:04] <imsky> my biggest pet peeve of all time
[14:11:09] <imsky> @import url("core.css");
[14:11:15] <imsky> god damn whoever keeps doing that
[14:11:40] <abjorn> lol
[14:11:47] <abjorn> I never end up using @import lul
[14:11:57] <imsky> it's worse than <link> afaik
[14:12:02] <imsky> and yet i see it used all over
[14:12:12] <abjorn> I've never seen a need for it
[14:12:41] <abjorn> of course, I generally end up having everything in one or two css files anyways
[14:12:51] <imsky> yeah same here'
[14:13:22] <imsky> http://inplainenglish.biz/css/default.css
[14:13:25] <imsky> this is regrettable though
[14:13:56] <abjorn> hush
[14:14:06] <imsky> http://inplainenglish.biz/css/secondary.css
[14:14:12] <imsky> why this exists, i don't know
[14:14:31] <abjorn> why not
[14:14:40] <imsky> lol but why
[14:18:08] <kojiro> @import could be very worthwhile. It's just not, because other parts of CSS that would make it useful (like context nesting) aren't in place
[14:18:12] <kojiro> http://www.wait-till-i.com/2005/12/06/what-i-want-from-css3-nested-declaration-blocks/ for example
[14:18:30] <imsky> it's not worthwhile when you're viewing source
[14:19:01] <imsky> gotta whip out the firebug to actually get anything done
[14:19:07] <kojiro> that's usually true, though
[14:19:15] <kojiro> especially with generated code
[14:19:31] <kojiro> or "compressed" code, like so many people do with css and js
[14:19:57] <kojiro> there're a couple of add-ons besides firebug that will give you a pretty-printed view or attempt to de-obfuscate stuff
[14:20:23] <kojiro> But that doesn't have much to do with @import
[14:21:38] <imsky> oh shit
[14:21:43] <imsky> happy memorial day everyone
[14:21:45] <imsky> aw yeeeah
[14:21:54] <abjorn> lol you just realized that?
[14:21:58] <kojiro> heh
[14:22:06] <imsky> i realized i didn't tell anyone on irc
[14:22:13] <imsky> MissionCritical: accomplished
[14:22:16] <imsky> what the hell
[14:22:43] <imsky> mission:accomplished
[14:22:48] <imsky> good job, pchat autonickcomplete
[14:23:12] <d4rklit3> i dont think i understand how this fancybox thing works
[14:23:25] <imsky> did you pay tribute to the million who died in service of this country, d4rklit3 ?
[14:23:30] <imsky> millions* even
[14:23:45] <imsky> once you do
[14:23:46] <d4rklit3> which country
[14:23:50] <imsky> this country
[14:23:53] <imsky> the only country
[14:24:15] <imsky> with a memorial day on may 30th
[14:24:16] <ravenzz> China? lol
[14:24:37] <d4rklit3> im trying to do some javascript here
[14:24:43] <imsky> pay tribute dammit
[14:24:48] * d4rklit3 pays tribute
[14:24:51] <d4rklit3> there
[14:24:52] <imsky> it's because of brave men and women that you can do javascript
[14:24:53] <abjorn> the many men who died for javascript
[14:24:57] <d4rklit3> lol
[14:25:03] <abjorn> not women tho
[14:25:03] <d4rklit3> i hope it was worth it
[14:25:04] <abjorn> never women
[14:25:15] <imsky> you can't $(document).ready your way out of national security
[14:25:22] <imsky> that shit needs sacrifice
[14:25:42] <abjorn> jaboscriiipt
[14:25:47] <imsky> jabo 4ever
[14:25:48] <imsky> which reminds me
[14:25:52] <imsky> duke nukem forever is coming
[14:26:03] <imsky> a perfect memorial day pre-order present
[14:26:05] <d4rklit3> how the hell do i use this fucking thing
[14:26:05] <imsky> if ever there was one
[14:26:17] <imsky> d4rklit3: you sound angry
[14:26:21] <imsky> are you perchance a terrist?
[14:26:38] <ravenzz> mhahu
[14:26:44] <abjorn> that special edition coming with an NVIDIA card
[14:26:51] <d4rklit3> i dunno half a page of instructions doesn't help anyone
[14:26:57] <ravenzz> i don't speak english but i love to read you
[14:26:59] <imsky> god, dn4 is gonna be a great summer present
[14:27:00] <ravenzz> lol
[14:27:18] <abjorn> that sounds like an awkward proposition
[14:27:21] <abjorn> "I love to read you"
[14:27:26] <imsky> i read to love you
[14:27:57] <imsky> wikipedia says there should be a barbecue to celebrate this memorial day
[14:28:05] <imsky> i am not partaking in a 'cue right now
[14:28:09] <imsky> perhaps i should
[14:28:51] <abjorn> I don't think I've ever celebrated memorial day
[14:28:59] <imsky> pay tribute!
[14:29:49] <imsky> oh dammit and i missed the indy 500
[14:29:54] <imsky> which was yesterday
[14:30:00] <imsky> what the hell is going on
[14:30:05] <imsky> no 'cue, no race
[14:30:15] <stefancrs> hm, .submit() on a form does not behave like a normal client-side submit?
[14:30:25] <imsky> stefancrs: it totally does
[14:30:28] <stefancrs> wtf
[14:30:30] <imsky> foreigners should also pay tribute
[14:30:35] <imsky> to memorial day stuff
[14:31:00] <stefancrs> I get a whole bunch of stuff happening I don't expect to happen :)(
[14:31:17] <imsky> stefancrs: yeah, just like europe in the 1940s
[14:31:51] <noel_g> any ideas what would cause a toggle to be called multiple times on a single event.  e.g. this http://pastie.org/1995110  first time get 1, second get 2,1 third get 1,2,1
[14:32:00] <stefancrs> the form gets posted, and I see the proper response in firebug to that request, but that's not what gets displayed. the page just reloads
[14:32:25] <stefancrs> and that ends up being wrong, because the action url shows different stuff on a reload and on a post
[14:32:39] <Jester831> any suggestions for improving http://pastebin.com/5nTPnUQG
[14:32:50] <ravenzz> ?p @ stefancrs
[14:32:51] <bot-t> stefancrs, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js or http://fixee.org/
[14:33:12] <stefancrs> ravenzz: it's a somewhat... complex situation
[14:34:07] <stefancrs> ravenzz: actual javascript: http://pastie.org/1995131
[14:35:46] <stefancrs> heh, how do I get the html? it's injected using ajax... :)
[14:38:23] <stefancrs> ah well, ravenzz, i have a form like so: http://pastie.org/1995150
[14:38:37] <d4rklit3> im trying to figure out how to make fancybox do something after it submits a form
[14:39:52] <geestring> I can't think right now.... i've been trying to figure out how many half hours there are between two variables, which will have the start and end times like so, 1100 and 1430
[14:40:36] <ravenzz> stefancrs did you debug result ?
[14:40:55] <stefancrs> ravenzz: not sure how, I mean, I see what happens http request wise
[14:41:06] <stefancrs> ravenzz: but not sure how to understand WHY that happens
[14:42:55] <ravenzz> why don't add some breakpoints to the error, complete and success callback?
[14:43:38] <ravenzz> http://fixingthesejquery.com
[14:44:06] <d4rklit3> anyone familiar with fancybox
[14:44:35] <stefancrs> ravenzz: ah, running in a debugger?
[14:44:40] <stefancrs> never done that with js
[14:45:44] <stefancrs> ah well, seems to be the way forward. will have a looksie tomorrow
[14:45:53] <stefancrs> getting too late to actually learn new tools
[14:46:22] <stefancrs> aha, in firebug
[14:46:23] <stefancrs> cool
[14:46:25] <stefancrs> :)
[14:46:35] <Jester831> screw firebug, go chrome web dev tools
[14:46:36] <sear> o_O
[14:46:46] <stefancrs> Jester831: hate the net inspector in chrome
[14:47:04] <sear> I really enjoy the Web Inspector in Safari.
[14:47:13] <Jester831> the script debugging and network viewer are amazing
[14:47:20] <ravenzz> I prefer the chrome ones
[14:47:28] <sear> Meh.  To each their own.
[14:47:29] <Jester831> the safari one and chromes are both similar no?
[14:47:30] <ravenzz> sear that's the same of chroem
[14:47:40] <sear> Yes, the Safari and Chrome ones are the same
[14:47:47] <ravenzz> chrome, even
[14:47:52] <sear> It's the standard Webkit debugger if I'm not mistaken
[14:48:20] <sear> Well... dev tools.  Debugger is too specific
[14:49:05] <Jester831> ah yea, though chrome has more dev extensions
[14:49:15] <sear> Fair enough.
[14:49:42] <sear> I can't say I DISLIKE any set of dev tools save for IE's.
[14:49:45] <sear> If you can call it that.
[14:50:12] <Jester831> eh, I only like the webkit dev tools
[14:50:13] <d4rklit3> what is the best way to have a lightbox popup with a form on it, when that form is submitted it returns some json encoded data, and depending on that data i want things to happen asynchronously on the page
[14:50:26] <stefancrs> hm
[14:50:33] <stefancrs> it seems the submit values wheren't posted
[14:50:39] <lucian> webkit's dev tools have some issues with changing the entire DOM from under it. very apparent with jquery mobile
[14:50:49] <lucian> but yeah, they're all good
[14:50:56] <Jester831> use jquery.ajax and add a successful callback
[14:51:13] <d4rklit3> Jester831: i want to use a lightbox tho
[14:51:23] <stefancrs> ah well, it works now
[14:51:24] <Jester831> so?
[14:51:25] <stefancrs> time to sleep
[14:51:25] <Lampoon> so are you
[14:51:26] <sear> d4rklit3: Breaking that problem down into several parts will get you everywhere.
[14:51:26] <stefancrs> thanks all
[14:51:28] <ravenzz> d4rklit3 it's easy to write a simple lightbox
[14:51:35] <ravenzz> in css/html
[14:51:42] <d4rklit3> im just using previously made on
[14:51:43] <d4rklit3> e.g fancybox
[14:51:49] <d4rklit3> it has an ajax feature
[14:51:53] <d4rklit3> im just not sure how its used
[14:52:02] <ravenzz> then read the fancybox Doc
[14:52:05] <sear> ^^
[14:52:05] <d4rklit3> i am
[14:52:06] <Jester831> I wouldn't use their ajax
[14:52:15] <d4rklit3> ajax 	{ } 	Ajax options
[14:52:16] <d4rklit3> thanks
[14:52:16] <sear> We are no match for real documentation.
[14:52:17] <d4rklit3> helpful
[14:52:18] <ravenzz> i can't know any callback
[14:52:31] <ravenzz> or functions:P
[14:52:38] <d4rklit3> im guessing those ajax options are from jquery
[14:52:47] <Jester831> so, http://pastebin.com/5nTPnUQG anyone?
[14:53:18] <sear> Are you having an issue with that code, Jester831?
[14:53:20] <Jester831> I'm assuming there *must* be a better (none-templating)* way to do that
[14:53:21] <enoj> is there a way I can check if an element already has a certain function event handler bound?
[14:53:28] <Jester831> yea sear, it doesn't work in IE
[14:53:39] <sear> D:
[14:54:09] <sear> I'll pick at it, but I'm no expert at this yet.  :P
[14:54:36] <Jester831> it's distinctly possible that the issue is not from that snippet of code, though i'll have to test
[14:54:38] <RandalSchwartz> I was looking for what changed in 1.5 and 1.6, and went to the obvious http://docs.jquery.com/History_of_jQuery
[14:54:48] <RandalSchwartz> and that hasn't been updated since last year. :(
[14:54:54] <sear> Yeah, this looks like pretty sound code to me Jester831.
[14:54:56] <Jester831> nonetheless, there's probably some ways to improve said snippet
[14:55:15] <sear> I'm sure there is some way, but it looks nice and solid to me.
[14:55:31] <Jester831> there's no way to do ob buffering or anything?
[14:55:53] <sear> Sorry, not familiar with ob buffering.
[14:55:57] <sear> <-- new or something.
[14:56:04] <Jester831> i don't even know if js has ob buffering lol
[14:56:38] <reedyseth> can I generate images from a DOM with JQuery ??
[14:57:27] <Jester831> you can load images, and do canvasing
[14:57:59] <teknoid> reedyseth: i think client-side image generation is asking for trouble (for the next few years, at least) ;)
[14:58:22] <reedyseth> Jester831: but if a have some design with my DOM export it to an image
[14:58:56] <sear> reedyseth: Not quite sure what you're asking here... =/
[14:59:08] <Jester831> I second that
[14:59:13] <Jester831> and demand a sammich
[14:59:22] <sear> I just had a fantastic dinner.
[14:59:24] <sear> :D
[15:00:10] <Jester831> nice
[15:00:10] <reedyseth> I mean that if i can export some part of my page, div or dom to an image
[15:00:30] <Jester831> well, you can print pdf from the dom
[15:01:07] <reedyseth> Jester831: yes, something like that but intead a pdf an image? have you ever heard if it's possible?
[15:01:21] <jedimind> http://www.windowscanada.ca/verticalslider.html
[15:01:24] <jedimind> so not what i was looking for :(
[15:01:39] <d4rklit3> :( i dont understand how to do this
[15:01:57] <d4rklit3> there is one page of docs for this entire library
[15:02:00] <d4rklit3> that tells you nothing
[15:02:14] <Jester831> printdomtree
[15:04:16] <d4rklit3> h8 js
[15:05:27] <sear> Perhaps you should direct that 'h8' towards learning the language, d4rklit3.
[15:07:02] <d4rklit3> its not the language
[15:07:04] <jedimind> anyone played iwth jquery and css3 tweening to get some decent perspective demos going ?
[15:07:05] <d4rklit3> im having trouble w/
[15:07:21] <d4rklit3> there is no documentation
[15:07:27] <d4rklit3> that is proper
[15:07:40] <d4rklit3> its like "hi, we do some ajax stuff... and we documented it by saying so"
[15:07:49] <sear> Oh.  That's kinda dumb.
[15:08:06] <d4rklit3> have you been to fancybox site
[15:08:12] <sear> Nope.
[15:08:12] <d4rklit3> 1.5 pages of docs
[15:08:22] <d4rklit3> no more than a sentance for anything
[15:09:19] <d4rklit3> ok let me ask this
[15:09:35] <cerzi> hi all, im looking to create some kind of system that shows an empty picture frame, and when clicked brings up a popup with a bunch of image thumbnails to choose from, and after selecting one of them the popup closes and the selected image is now sitting in the previously empty frame.. anyone know of a plugin that does this or similar?
[15:09:52] <d4rklit3> if i load something in an iframe (say a form) do i have access to its classes via jquery?
[15:10:36] <jedimind> where's paul when you need him
[15:10:55] <kojiro> ireland?
[15:10:56] * kojiro ducks
[15:12:32] <kojiro> d4rklit3: regardless of the iframe situation, it obeys the same origin policy
[15:13:17] <jedimind> irish paul
[15:14:26] <d4rklit3> all i want to do.. is open a form that sends post and receives json, when it receives json it should read it  and depending on what that response is it does something to to the DOM
[15:15:16] <jedimind> d4rklit3, so whats the problem ?
[15:15:35] <d4rklit3> making that work w/ fancybox
[15:15:39] <d4rklit3> i have no idea
[15:16:48] <abjorn> dododo
[15:17:11] <d4rklit3> like making fancybox handle a callback
[15:17:20] <abjorn> aw why did imsky leave
[15:19:10] <gnarf> .seen imsky
[15:19:10] <hsbot> imsky was seen 2 minutes and 46 seconds ago, quitting with the message: Quit: Leaving
[15:19:54] <m1chael> does anyone know about parsing json? i'm having some trouble
[15:24:11] <d4rklit3> how do i bind a callback to a to something that is loaded via an iframe
[15:24:25] <d4rklit3> i don't even know what to ask
[15:26:12] <abjorn> gnarf: yeah I know, he left right before I said that
[15:32:24] <coldhead> pilgo: did you sort your problem?
[15:32:54] <pilgo> coldhead: Oh, thanks so much for your help. Just trying out your method: http://jsfiddle.net/Pgw4J/
[15:33:38] <coldhead> pilgo: i accidentally removed the code that assigns var id = ... so you need to get that back
[15:33:56] <pilgo> coldhead: Yeah, just discovered that :)
[15:34:32] <abjorn> way to go coldhead GAWD
[15:39:29] <pilgo> coldhead: if ($(this).is('up')) Doesn't evaluate to true although the <a> has an "up" class.
[15:40:50] <pilgo> coldhead: Oh, I think it's just missing a "."
[15:44:36] <m1chael> im trying to parse JSON.. http://dpaste.com/548393/ # my problem is between line 14 and 22 .. i know that i'm not parsing/looping through the data properly.. does anyone know how to do this properly?
[15:45:54] <coldhead> well debugged, pilgo
[15:51:46] <Mfapz> hi, when i use $(this).parent().text('<img src="/images/loading.gif">');
[15:51:55] <Mfapz> it does change it, but it literally shows up '<img src="/images/loading.gif">'
[15:52:16] <Mfapz> i.e. '&lt;img src="/images/loading.gif"&gt;'
[15:52:20] <Mfapz> any idea why?
[15:52:27] <gkatsev> because you're using .text
[15:52:37] <gkatsev> use .html, as was said in #css
[15:52:39] <gkatsev> :)
[15:53:46] <Mfapz> didnt notice. thanks.
[16:00:48] <pilgo> I'm a little confused about what variables are accessible in an ajax call back function
[16:01:03] <jedimind> all of them!
[16:01:47] <d4rklit3> how do i get the value from $(":input");
[16:02:15] <pilgo> jedimind: At line 26, I can access "id" but not "full_id" http://dpaste.com/548394/
[16:02:21] <btipling> is this also the channel for jquery ui?
[16:04:21] <d4rklit3> what is this?  $(":input");
[16:04:28] <d4rklit3> how do i pull out the values from that
[16:04:44] <btipling> :is a psuedo element
[16:04:54] <btipling> input is not a psuedo element
[16:05:06] <btipling> er psuedo selector
[16:05:19] <pilgo> coldhead: Can you shine some light on the above? I'm just trying to fix the vote updating part.
[16:05:47] <glen1> not jquery related but is it possible to check out the traffic of a site if you dont own it?
[16:07:06] <d4rklit3> i understand  that if i use the selecter ":input"   it gives me an object (?) full of the inputs? however it makes no mention as to how to get the values of them, clearly doing a for each doesn't help so im at a loss..
[16:11:56] <coldhead> full_id should be accessible at line 26, pilgo
[16:12:17] <coldhead> its enclosed by the function surrounding it
[16:12:25] <pilgo> coldhead: Hmm.. that's odd because I'm debugging at that line and the console prints "undefined."
[16:12:47] <coldhead> console.log it to make sure it has a value at creation?
[16:13:13] <coldhead> undefined =/= does not exist
[16:13:35] <coldhead> brb coffee fetching
[16:13:54] <pilgo> k
[16:14:29] <d4rklit3> is it possible to select an input element by its name?
[16:14:58] <jedimind> input[name=something]
[16:18:46] <pilgo> coldhead: Yeah, console.log does show it but the debugger for some reason wasn't!
[16:19:40] <pilgo> coldhead: Anyway, it's almost fully working! I just have to deal with a case of when neither are "voted" and I should be good to go. Thanks so much for helping out
[16:20:52] <crankharder> so, if I use a jquery element inside of setTimeout, that element is out of scope/undefined by the time the function executes -- is there a way to re-query the same element inside of setTimeout?
[16:21:01] <rachelbot> hi
[16:21:18] <rachelbot> how do I dynamically load an image and fade it in when it's loaded
[16:24:24] <Funhouse>  What is the correct way method for redirect the parent frame in IE7?
[16:27:24] <felo> coldhead: I need to compare comment id variable with the  commentid data attribute passed inside the slideToggle function http://jsfiddle.net/xysxD/52/
[16:28:02] <felo> was wondering if I should do it inside the javascript code or bring it to the server
[16:33:58] <jedimind> hey anyone wanna build me a vertical carousel with perspective tweening ?
[16:33:59] <serard> hello
[16:34:57] <nardev> hello i want to make sidebar widget so that others can copy/baste it to their website and get content from my page in their sidebar. do you guys have any example about making it?
[16:35:28] <nardev> biggest obstacle for me is how to make it available so that they only copy part of javascript code
[16:35:38] <serard> someone got bugs on jquery ui 1.8.13 with draggable, about ui.item giving the helper instead of the original element ?
[16:36:08] <Draconisle> Good Evening
[16:36:52] <Draconisle> Does anyone know where I can freely download a "Powered by jQuery" image so I can put it on my site?
[16:37:15] <pilgo> I want to test this: do children have "abc" class?
[16:37:38] <pilgo> Or does any child have "abc" class?
[16:40:52] <coldhead> good work, pilgo, happy to have helped. mostly i wanted you to have less code so i'd have less to help you debug in future :)
[16:41:17] <pilgo> coldhead: Haha, yeah, that's always a good idea :)
[16:42:43] <Floss> trying to set a delay in a detached function, any ideas?
[16:43:06] <Floss> $(document).delay(1000) doesnt render anything
[16:43:44] <enoj> I want to use slideDown() as a <div> gets gets updated from an ajax icon to a bunch of text - how can I make that work? because if I do .text() first, then it will jump down and then up again when slideDown runs
[16:46:23] <jedimind> enoj, make the div display: none; by default
[16:46:36] <Floss> nice
[16:46:38] <jedimind> or on page load slideUp() that div even if its empty
[16:46:50] <jedimind> so that without js, it's not hidden (if there's actual content in there on page load)
[16:48:20] <enoj> div is never empty. on initial load it has data - then on a click it is replaced with an <img> for a loading ajax icon, and then it gets filled with data again when the ajax returns
[16:48:40] <enoj> it is a "Show more x"-kinda thing
[16:49:06] <jedimind> i guess the question is do you need it to be functional without js?
[16:49:17] <enoj> no
[16:49:21] <jedimind> if so, use slideup, if you dont care, then just display: none;
[16:50:03] <Draconisle> jedimind:  so it wont display until the ajax is triggered?
[16:50:40] <jedimind> it wont display until he does a slideDown
[16:50:48] <Draconisle> nice
[16:51:24] <Floss> *delay problem sovled:$("#abstract").delay(3000).queue(function(){ //embedded execution
[16:51:55] <bot-t> Floss, .delay() is best for delaying between queued jQuery effects and such, and is not a replacement for JavaScript's native setTimeout function, which may be more appropriate for certain use cases. (from api.jquery.com/delay/ )
[16:55:06] <Floss> thanks bot-t
[16:55:07] <bot-t> Floss, I'm a bot you know..
[16:55:16] <Floss> yes and no
[16:55:30] <Floss> but mostly no
[16:55:38] <Floss> id?
[16:57:30] <geestring> which function would I use to get the text of a variable after "-"
[16:58:03] <geestring> so i want to parse var c = "sdfsdfsdf - room one";
[17:00:02] <ajpiano> geestring use split
[17:00:25] <ajpiano> ?eval var c = "sdfjakdjfkl - bkjalbmlk";  c.split(" - ")[1];
[17:00:26] <bot-t> ajpiano: "bkjalbmlk"
[17:00:35] <Floss> you could use charAt, substr and length to extract a string from end of a line
[17:00:38] <GoGoGarrett> Hello
[17:01:03] <Floss> there is also indexOf and lastIndexOf
[17:01:34] <Floss> oh charAt only returns the char
[17:01:41] <Floss> <- out of practice
[17:02:11] <geestring> cool thanks
[17:02:47] <Floss> need further demonstrating just ask.
[17:09:52] <Draconisle> yeah I would use javascript instead of jQuery for text parsing
[17:11:05] <Draconisle> you can probably use the split function if you know that you are working with standardized text
[17:13:05] <Draconisle> for example:  if you always know that there is a " - " separating a username and a department name ("John Smith - Finance")
[17:15:08] <d4rklit3> what is the best way to take json data and turn it into an array
[17:18:49] <ryanseddon> wouldn't the json data be an array already, otherwise use $.each or a for in loop to go over an object
[17:20:10] <d4rklit3> well its a json array
[17:20:25] <d4rklit3> do js arrays allow for associate arrays
[17:20:40] <ryanseddon> you mean array[1][2]?
[17:21:02] <d4rklit3> the json is being pulled in as such   [ {}, {}, {}, {}]
[17:21:13] <ryanseddon> thats just an array
[17:21:13] <d4rklit3> so thats data
[17:21:28] <ryanseddon> you would access it like data[0].obj etc
[17:21:32] <d4rklit3> ok
[17:21:36] <d4rklit3> but .each wou;dn't work
[17:21:55] <ryanseddon> each passes both the index and the key as arguments
[17:22:25] <d4rklit3> yeah i don't need the key
[17:22:32] <d4rklit3> i need to just use an iterating foor loop
[17:22:33] <Draconisle> does getJSON and use a function for $.each work?
[17:22:34] <d4rklit3> for
[17:22:59] <ajpiano> d4rklit3: are you trying something and it isn't working right?
[17:23:06] <ajpiano> do you have some code?
[17:23:18] <d4rklit3> just curious
[17:23:28] <ajpiano> otherwise, as Draconisle said, you just be fine with just using $.getJSON and then using $.each or a for loop over the array of objects
[17:23:43] <d4rklit3> im using $.get
[17:23:43] <Draconisle> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getJSON/
[17:23:51] <d4rklit3> with "json" as type
[17:23:56] <ajpiano> same thing then
[17:23:59] <d4rklit3> yep
[17:24:11] <Draconisle> there are examples on the .getJSON section
[17:24:26] <Draconisle> pretty good example actually
[17:25:08] <d4rklit3> i think i got it
[17:25:16] <d4rklit3> im having a hard time just rendering shit in html
[17:25:27] <d4rklit3> i've long forgotten this stufff
[17:26:15] <d4rklit3> here is a dumb question.. how do i "trace" stuff out to the console
[17:26:16] <d4rklit3> in js
[17:26:26] <Draconisle> use $.getJSON and in the function, use $.each with concentrating on the columns/attributes you want to be in the array
[17:26:54] <ryanseddon> console.log/warn/error/info
[17:28:07] <d4rklit3> ok, i would like to dynamically make css
[17:28:14] <d4rklit3> like i want to create a grid of images
[17:28:56] <d4rklit3> or something to that extent so i want to just create these elements and then give them x,y position relative to the div they are nested in
[17:29:05] <pilgo> Is it possible to have a function run when anything inside an iframe is clicked?
[17:29:15] <pilgo> Sure it can be a security breach, but it'd be useful :)
[17:29:32] <ryanseddon> pilgo: postMessage may help you there
[17:30:58] <ryanseddon> d4rklit3: you can assign inline styles to an element using css({prop:val})
[17:31:09] <d4rklit3> ok cool
[17:31:19] <d4rklit3> and is there a proper way to make an element
[17:31:26] <d4rklit3> or just make it as a string
[17:31:51] <pilgo> ryanseddon: Not quite what i need but thanks. I have no access to iframe at all.
[17:32:10] <ryanseddon> $("<div/>",{attributes:value})
[17:32:39] <d4rklit3> huh?
[17:32:42] <d4rklit3> oo
[17:32:48] <d4rklit3> then i can make an onclick for that yes?
[17:33:04] <Draconisle> d4rklit3:  however you want to handle the events is up to you
[17:33:05] <ryanseddon> hold on I'll do a quick jsafiddle rather than spam the channel
[17:33:24] <d4rklit3> Draconisle: ?
[17:33:52] <Draconisle> d4rklit3:  you asked if you could use onclick...then yes...the jQuery equivalent is .click
[17:33:56] <d4rklit3> yeah
[17:34:19] <Draconisle> I would create the css in the css file
[17:34:33] <Draconisle> then if you want, you can apply to a div in advance and just add the images
[17:34:49] <Draconisle> the css would handle the display and the jquery would handle the event handling
[17:34:50] <d4rklit3> hrm so lets say i want to make a <span/> and put some text in it
[17:35:17] <d4rklit3> var item = $("<span/>", {'id':'category'}); item.text("blah"); item.click(func...
[17:36:01] <ryanseddon> d4rklit3: http://jsfiddle.net/ryanseddon/Apz89/
[17:37:12] <d4rklit3> ryanseddon: what about css
[17:37:15] <d4rklit3> thats seperate yes?
[17:37:53] <ryanseddon> no just do css as a property
[17:37:58] <d4rklit3> o ok
[17:38:15] <d4rklit3> for css props, do i need to add quotes to the key's?
[17:38:24] <ryanseddon> http://jsfiddle.net/ryanseddon/Apz89/1/ <-- any jQuery method can be used
[17:38:28] <ryanseddon> almost any
[17:38:38] <Draconisle> quotes for the whole attribute list i think
[17:39:16] <d4rklit3> 'position' : 'relative'
[17:39:17] <d4rklit3> ?
[17:39:18] <Draconisle> if the css is standard, you can just say .addclass and add the appropriate css from your css file
[17:39:30] <d4rklit3> well if im doing it all shorthand
[17:39:40] <ryanseddon> yeah classes are always better than doing inline styles for elements
[17:40:35] <d4rklit3> hold on
[17:40:44] <Draconisle> sample
[17:40:45] <Draconisle> .css({'background-color' : 'yellow', 'font-weight' : 'bolder'});
[17:40:53] <d4rklit3> yeah
[17:41:01] <d4rklit3> addClass requries a premade class yes?
[17:41:04] <Draconisle> yes
[17:41:14] <Draconisle> but it saves on the coding on the page
[17:41:28] <Draconisle> because you would be dynamically adding a class, not the whole css list
[17:41:29] <d4rklit3> so i can inject a premade class but want to modify the top/left values
[17:41:34] <Draconisle> yes
[17:41:41] <d4rklit3> so i would addclass
[17:41:49] <d4rklit3> thats in my css file then .css() to modify
[17:41:56] <Draconisle> yes
[17:41:58] <Draconisle> correct
[17:41:59] <d4rklit3> gotcha
[17:42:22] <Draconisle> you can also use the css file as a base, and add things that are context specific
[17:42:31] <Draconisle> in the .css
[17:42:40] <Draconisle> in the $.css that is
[17:44:18] <d4rklit3> ok here is something i just don't understand
[17:44:19] <d4rklit3> about css
[17:44:22] <d4rklit3> wtf is relative for
[17:44:44] <Draconisle> relative is relative to the elements on the page
[17:45:02] <Draconisle> absolute ignores all elements and positions absolutely on the dom itself
[17:45:10] <d4rklit3> i want to work in an environment where if there is a div and then i nest elements inside it.. if their position is relative they are all relative to the parents
[17:45:27] <d4rklit3> so like the TL of the parent is 0,0
[17:45:30] <d4rklit3> for all the elements
[17:46:28] <Draconisle> it would benefit having examples
[17:46:28] <Draconisle> http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_positioning.asp
[17:48:12] <Draconisle> just an FYI, the inherit value of the position attribute is rarely used, at least by me
[17:48:29] <Draconisle> relative and absolute are usually what are used
[17:50:15] <Draconisle> another good example would probably be css menus
[17:50:26] <Draconisle> they leverage alot of the relative value
[17:50:57] <d4rklit3> when i add that on click
[17:51:02] <d4rklit3> how come it can't see data[i].name
[17:51:26] <Draconisle> you can have a function inside the .click
[17:51:31] <d4rklit3> i do
[17:51:35] <d4rklit3> im doing it in inline
[17:51:40] <d4rklit3> like you had pasted it
[17:51:51] <Draconisle> whatever you put in the array must also be put in the html
[17:52:26] <Draconisle> you can use the $.html to add your array to the page
[17:52:32] <d4rklit3> i can add it
[17:52:37] <d4rklit3> but like the array data
[17:52:40] <d4rklit3> i can't get
[17:53:07] <d4rklit3> http://pastie.org/1995758
[17:53:22] <d4rklit3> like im not sure what to pass that function
[17:53:30] <d4rklit3> im trying something that works in flash
[17:53:46] <Draconisle> try this one
[17:53:47] <Draconisle> http://api.jquery.com/html/
[17:54:16] <nofxx1> Which template engine will be in jquery core in future ? I'm kinda lost ..something like $('li', attr:.....
[17:55:02] <d4rklit3> i dont have issues with rendering it
[17:55:05] <d4rklit3> its that alert
[17:55:08] <d4rklit3> in the onclick
[17:55:34] <coldhead> ajpiano: lay down the official line on the jQuery template engine?
[17:55:40] <coldhead> i assume it has changed again again again
[17:56:52] <Draconisle> i cant understand the code
[17:57:04] <Draconisle> i think you need to break it down
[17:58:13] <d4rklit3> so click: function (event) etc etc
[17:58:20] <d4rklit3> that function
[17:58:25] <d4rklit3> i need it to know what im clicking on
[17:58:46] <coldhead> d4rklit3: this/$(this)
[17:59:28] <Draconisle> $('#spanid').click()
[17:59:45] <d4rklit3> alert("clicked on "+ $(this).data[i]);
[17:59:45] <d4rklit3> 			 	
[17:59:45] <d4rklit3> ?
[17:59:50] <Draconisle> or use the $(this).click() as coldhead said
[18:00:04] <d4rklit3> ok
[18:00:10] <coldhead> ?alert
[18:00:10] <bot-t> Forget alert—use console.log() in Firebug (or your browser’s built in Developer Tools) and welcome to convenience! http://getfirebug.com
[18:00:18] <d4rklit3> yeah yeah
[18:00:22] <Draconisle> inside the click, use the getJSON and appendTo stuff
[18:01:39] <Draconisle> just an FYI, I would use the span id just to make sure the click only runs for the ones you want
[18:02:00] <Draconisle> $(this) is too general
[18:02:41] <d4rklit3> its already json
[18:03:05] <d4rklit3> like this:
[18:03:06] <d4rklit3> http://pastie.org/1995758
[18:03:16] <d4rklit3> the click thing i know isn't going to work
[18:04:21] <d4rklit3> i just want data[i] to be available for the click handler
[18:04:39] <d4rklit3> its going to need to run a method to load specific video clips from a category in that array
[18:04:53] <d4rklit3> so it needs that id
[18:04:56] <d4rklit3> "i"
[18:05:44] <d4rklit3> this is where js is falling short for me. this is like 4 lines of code in as3
[18:06:57] <Draconisle> question about your code
[18:07:00] <d4rklit3> sure
[18:07:09] <ajpiano> d4rklit3: you should use $.each
[18:07:10] <Draconisle> the data you are returning is the json data?
[18:07:15] <d4rklit3> yes
[18:07:22] <ajpiano> then you'll have a safe reference to the data in the click handler
[18:07:31] <ajpiano> which you should be binding using jquery's .click(function() { })
[18:07:33] <d4rklit3> using $.get(args..s, 'json')
[18:07:36] <ajpiano> not $(this).click= function() {})
[18:08:04] <d4rklit3> .click = function(event)
[18:08:08] <d4rklit3> i need the event don't I?
[18:08:24] <Draconisle> yes
[18:08:28] <Draconisle> your code is confusing
[18:08:34] <ajpiano> d4rklit3, that's not how it works
[18:08:34] <ajpiano> it's
[18:08:43] <Draconisle> yes
[18:08:43] <ajpiano> $(this).click(function(event) { });
[18:08:47] <Draconisle> aj is right
[18:09:02] <d4rklit3> all i want to do is make an element dynamically
[18:09:06] <d4rklit3> and have it run a method onclick
[18:09:38] <ajpiano> d4rklit3, you should so totally look at the examples on http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getJSON/
[18:09:53] <Draconisle> correct
[18:09:59] <Draconisle> but you syntax is incorrect
[18:10:03] <Draconisle> your*
[18:10:14] <Draconisle> the properties you are passing are also incorrect
[18:10:35] * d4rklit3 misses actionscript 3
[18:10:45] * d4rklit3 misses objects :(
[18:10:50] <Draconisle> the examples on the api section will guide your through the proper syntax
[18:10:56] <Draconisle> you*
[18:10:58] <d4rklit3> i dont even know wtf im doing
[18:11:05] <Draconisle> haha
[18:11:15] <d4rklit3> i want to create a dynamic element
[18:11:18] <d4rklit3> where is that in the docs
[18:11:29] <Draconisle> basics is what you need first
[18:11:33] <Draconisle> then comes dynamic
[18:11:56] <ajpiano> http://pastie.org/1995822
[18:12:07] <ajpiano> Draconisle, you pass a string of html to $( )
[18:12:28] <ajpiano> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery
[18:12:37] <Draconisle> yes
[18:12:38] <ajpiano> the second signature
[18:12:44] <ajpiano> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery#jQuery2
[18:12:47] <Draconisle> or he can do the appendto also
[18:12:59] <d4rklit3> im sorry?   var thing = data[i],                       item = ..
[18:13:02] <d4rklit3> is that all one statement
[18:13:15] <d4rklit3> thing = data[i], item =?
[18:13:47] <ajpiano> d4rklit3, yes
[18:13:57] <ajpiano> you can chain multiple local variable delcarations with a single var statement
[18:13:59] <d4rklit3> so this.. is proper syntax for javascript?
[18:14:02] <ajpiano> and comma delimited variable names
[18:14:30] <d4rklit3> wow
[18:14:41] <d4rklit3> that seems nightmarish
[18:14:53] <ajpiano> no it's awesome
[18:15:46] <d4rklit3> i have friends who were flash devs
[18:15:51] <d4rklit3> who moved from as3 to this
[18:15:51] <ajpiano> http://wonko.com/post/try-to-use-one-var-statement-per-scope-in-javascript
[18:15:52] <coldhead> if that is nightmarish too you, good luck with everything else in the world ever
[18:15:57] <d4rklit3> and renounced flash completely
[18:16:01] <Heshanh> anyone know why is it when i do .click(function() on a chck box it trigger it twice?
[18:16:21] <coldhead> wonko.com isn't the boss of me!
[18:17:02] <d4rklit3> i wonder if as3 lets u do that
[18:17:03] <d4rklit3> i never tried
[18:17:05] <Draconisle> Heshanh:  are you using .click that could be applied to more than one selector?
[18:17:31] <Draconisle> *scratch that*
[18:18:01] <Heshanh> im calling it on a class
[18:18:38] <Heshanh> $(".client_act_delete").click(function(){ console.log("dada"); })
[18:18:56] <Heshanh> .client_act_delete is applied to 2 checkboxes
[18:21:24] <d4rklit3> ajpiano: so your method you posted just defaults that thing is always data[10]
[18:21:34] <d4rklit3> so no matter what i click
[18:21:37] <d4rklit3> thing is the same
[18:21:42] <d4rklit3> regardless of the value of i
[18:24:07] <ajpiano> oh right
[18:24:11] <ajpiano> this is why you should use each
[18:24:23] <ajpiano> ?forloopscope @ d4rklit3
[18:24:23] <bot-t> d4rklit3, http://forum.jquery.com/topic/binding-event-to-element-dynamically#14737000000958061
[18:25:19] <Draconisle> each is surprisingly easy to use
[18:25:49] <d4rklit3> .each was the answer
[18:25:52] <d4rklit3> yeah
[18:25:59] <d4rklit3> aack
[18:26:05] <d4rklit3> if it wasn't for apple
[18:26:12] <d4rklit3> everyone would be wanting flash everything
[18:26:25] <Draconisle> flash doesnt run on everything
[18:26:33] <Draconisle> hence the reason for HTML5
[18:26:34] <d4rklit3> and i would feel secure at my job indefinetly
[18:26:39] <d4rklit3> which nothing runs
[18:26:43] <d4rklit3> until 2020
[18:26:57] <d4rklit3> heh flash is going a whole other direction now anyways
[18:27:03] <d4rklit3> when html5 is standard
[18:27:05] <d4rklit3> flash will flash
[18:27:27] <d4rklit3> w/e
[18:27:30] <d4rklit3> php > js/as3
[18:27:39] <d4rklit3> and then .net.. i can't wait for that
[18:27:44] <d4rklit3> to learn * that is
[18:27:45] <d4rklit3> anyways
[18:27:46] <d4rklit3> im done
[18:27:50] <d4rklit3> thanks for everything fellas
[18:28:01] <Draconisle> props to aj
[18:28:09] <d4rklit3> ajpiano++
[18:28:13] <d4rklit3> Draconisle++
[18:28:22] <ajpiano> haha \o/
[18:28:26] <Draconisle> I google with the best of 'em
[18:28:31] <geestring> Can I target a column of td if the top TD has an id? In other words, can I say fill in all the td where the first td in the column has an id
[18:30:07] <Draconisle> adios folks
[18:30:11] <Draconisle> thanks ajpiano
[18:30:21] <Draconisle> learned a bunch today
[18:30:27] <Draconisle> *brain burp*

[19:15:25] <AfroTurf> sorry for the noob question
[19:20:47] <geestring> Ok I know I can get to the next Td by using next();
[19:21:06] <geestring> but what if I wanted to select the other tds?
[19:21:13] <geestring> not just the one next to it?
[19:21:20] <geestring> maybe 3 tds next to it

[20:07:27] <Floss> does jquery provide a workaround for the discrepancy in different browsers having the event.target's id needing to be referenced from event.target.parentNode.id?
[20:08:08] <ralphholzmann> Floss: what problem are you trying to navigate?
[20:08:29] <Floss> I am directly parsing the id of an element to a function
[20:08:45] <Floss> in certain versions of chrome it works, whilst others and IE 9 doesnt work
[20:09:08] <Floss> the id is being reference from a click function by using target.id, and alt target.parentNode.id
[20:09:21] <ralphholzmann> perhaps you could try
[20:09:33] <ralphholzmann> $( event.target.parentNode ).attr("id");
[20:09:49] <ralphholzmann> if jQuery does anything to fix some xbrowser discrepancy -- this would be how to do it
[20:09:51] <Floss> but in some browsers it is dereferenced back to target
[20:10:07] <ralphholzmann> okay, so try
[20:10:16] <ralphholzmann> $( event.target ).parent().attr("id");
[20:10:18] <Floss> so where i was using target.parentnode.id some actually have the Value in target.id
[20:10:20] <Floss> very weird
[20:10:33] <Floss> i will use a null verifier
[20:10:38] <Floss> thanks for your time :)
[20:10:40] <ralphholzmann> wat
[20:10:42] <ralphholzmann> okay
[20:10:43] <Floss> sanity check !
[20:10:45] <Floss> hehe
[20:10:46] <ralphholzmann> np, gl
[20:10:49] <Floss> ty
[20:14:15] <geestring> is it possible to find the current "Eq" value of the selector?
[20:14:45] <geestring> I basically want something like next() but next()+1, next()+2 etc..
[20:16:14] <RyanE> If 2 selectors return the same nodes in the debugger, is there any reason one works (click event handler attached), and the other wouldn't?  Here are the 2:
[20:16:17] <RyanE> $("#C4ListNav dt").not(".NoSelect").live({
[20:16:18] <RyanE> $("#C4ListNav dt.Selectable").live({
[20:17:53] <Floss> wow im so out of touch
[20:17:58] <Floss> function(event) {var target = (event.target.id.length > 0) ? event.target.id : event.target.parentNode.id; alert(target);ChangeFolder(target);
[20:18:07] <Floss> that took 5mins
[20:21:55] <geestring> can you use a next on top of a next like next().next() ?
[20:26:59] <djQuery> geestring: unless the original item was the last and then the 2nd next might be operating on a null
[20:31:49] <KingDosser> How can I add a delay to a function to avoid it flooding?
[20:33:10] <ryanseddon> you need a debounce method which is not built in.
[20:34:19] <ryanseddon> benalman has you covered though as always http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-throttle-debounce-plugin/
[20:34:21] <Anitox> gogo debounce!
[20:36:01] <justinTNT> _.debounce(function, wait)
[20:36:07] <KingDosser> How can I add a delay to a function to avoid it flooding?
[20:36:42] <Anitox> set a boolean so you know if it's actively running
[20:36:49] <Anitox> then check the boolean before executing
[20:36:57] <KingDosser> good thinking cheers
[21:06:28] <execution> this code triggers each one of the selectors. how would i narrow it so that it only tiggers the click handle for the one that WAS in focus? --> http://pastebin.com/cR35txdQ
[21:09:25] <Floss> is .post cross site sterile for any particular reason?
[21:10:45] <Floss> execution: your query is a bit beyong me buddy
[21:10:49] <Floss> :/
[21:11:56] <execution> ignore the keycode part
[21:12:05] <execution> just want to figure out how to target the one that was in focus
[21:12:26] <Floss> relatedId?
[21:12:28] <execution> right now my code applies to all of the elements... even if one was in focus
[21:12:28] <Floss> i dunno
[21:13:58] <Floss> does it make use of the selectable UI framework?
[21:14:13] <execution> no, sir
[21:14:24] <Floss> cool, i'll keep reading
[21:14:57] <Floss> http://api.jquery.com/focus-selector/
[21:15:04] <Floss> is that relevant?
[21:15:13] <Floss> thats my last assert...
[21:15:30] <Floss> oh you have tried that
[21:18:50] <anthony_dev> hi. I want to use datepicker from jquery ui, but I'm will it replace original jquery? (both uses same $ alias.) and to use datepicker I need core.js right?
[21:19:22] <execution> :)
[21:19:23] <Anitox> it doesnt replace it
[21:19:55] <Anitox> you can use the datepicker with jquery and still use all the jquery stuff
[21:20:24] <Floss> i cant find any datepicker in the core.js
[21:21:30] <Anitox> widgets -> datepicker
[21:21:43] <Anitox> http://jqueryui.com/download
[21:22:54] <Floss> that works in conjuction with the core.js
[21:23:14] <Floss> the UI Jquery framework uses the Jquery framework
[21:23:36] <Floss> i hope that helps
[21:28:04] <m0dmd> yoohoo!
[21:28:06] <m0dmd> sup everyone@
[21:28:32] <Floss> personally haven't opened my beer yet
[21:28:46] <m0dmd> open that ish!
[21:28:54] <Floss> but you go ahead
[21:38:41] <Electissimi> hey
[21:38:54] <KingDosser> How can I use like a wait timer
[21:39:04] <KingDosser> So something happens then wait 2 seconds.. then update
[21:39:30] <Electissimi> I have a quick question about a plugin "Fancybox" and ajax calls
[21:39:57] <Electissimi> Kingdosser like a delay?
[21:40:01] <KingDosser> Yes
[21:40:06] <Electissimi> .delay()
[21:41:18] <geestring> im using :contains to check for times however it is making a match when it looks for 2:00pm and finds it in 12:00pm.
[21:41:28] <geestring> is there another way of getting around this?
[21:42:17] <Electissimi> you're looking for 2:00 and it finds 12:00 too?
[21:42:38] <KingDosser> http://pastie.org/private/3ko9r5rmcbl90xwfzgmx2w This isnt working
[21:44:23] <KingDosser> Electissimi
[21:44:26] <Electissimi> hold on king
[21:44:30] <KingDosser> Cheers
[21:47:16] <khurram> hi all
[21:47:40] <Electissimi> try this king
[21:47:41] <Electissimi> http://pastebin.com/2we7Rc5N
[21:47:44] <khurram> i have form comming through ajax call in to one of my divs how can i grab its submit button and submit the form using ajax ?
[21:48:21] <Electissimi> use DOM khurram
[21:48:41] <khurram> i want to do it using jquery on submitevent
[21:49:33] <Electissimi> hmm that's almost the same issue i'm having then
[21:49:56] <CVertex> hi guys
[21:50:07] <khurram> howdy
[21:50:18] <Electissimi> I'm trying to load a lightbox through an ajax call
[21:50:20] <CVertex> does jQuery have it's own XHR object that's cross browser compat?
[21:50:34] <Electissimi> but because the elements load after the document loads it doesn't recognize the element
[21:50:40] <geestring> so yea, using :contains 2:00pm selects the td with 12:00pm
[21:51:05] <Electissimi> geestring that's because 12:00 contains the string "2:00"
[21:51:25] <Electissimi> is there a syntax for :begins?
[21:51:31] <Electissimi> or begins with?
[21:52:05] <geestring> i dont know. Im trying to figure out a way to do an exact match?
[21:52:24] <CVertex> ah, it's on the ajax page
[21:52:31] <KingDosser> No luck Electissimi
[21:59:32] <Electissimi> geestring
[21:59:40] <Electissimi> use :econtains
[22:02:02] <khurram> i have form comming through ajax call in to one of my divs how can i grab its submit button and submit the form using ajax ?
[22:02:25] <Etherael> is there a simple bind for mouseleave click (ie, mouse exits current item and clicks someplace else?)
[22:03:22] <Electissimi> could assign an element to toggle?
[22:05:04] <KingDosser> Can someone tell me why this isnt working please http://pastebin.com/2we7Rc5N
[22:05:40] <kamiweb> hello
[22:06:11] <khurram> when i serialize the form i can not see the file_dialog box ?
[22:06:46] <khurram> i am only getting the form text field and i am missing the value of  input type file when i serialize the form data ?
[22:07:34] <khurram> can i do the ajax for  a form with enctype = multipart/fom data
[22:08:04] <kamiweb> have u tried that?
[22:08:18] <coldhead> you can't ajax file inputs
[22:08:21] <coldhead> i'm sorry
[22:08:38] <ngharo> KingDosser: delay only works on animations
[22:08:48] <KingDosser> dam
[22:08:55] <KingDosser> how should i do it then>
[22:09:03] <ryanseddon> not with jQuery built in ajax method, you can in some browser using xhr2.upload

[22:09:28] <khurram> ajpiano: ?
[22:09:55] <Electissimi> what about this?> I load an element with id="inline" through ajax, the index file has the fancy box configuration but it doesn't run
[22:09:56] <coldhead> khurram: ?
[22:10:09] <Electissimi> is that because the element loads after the document?
[22:10:19] <ryanseddon> yeah
[22:10:22] <Electissimi> if so how would i go about fixing that?
[22:10:26] <khurram> i have a input type file in my form when i serialize the data i dont see the file filed value in it ?
[22:10:31] <ryanseddon> you'll need to reapply fancybox to any new elements
[22:10:41] <khurram> coldhead: i have a input type file in my form when i serialize the data i dont see the file filed value in it ?
[22:10:42] <coldhead> see my earlier reply, khurram
[22:10:44] <Electissimi> using DOM i presume?
[22:10:47] <coldhead> pay attention man!
[22:10:54] <khurram> aaaah
[22:10:56] <khurram> i c
[22:11:09] <coldhead> :)
[22:11:22] <Electissimi> ryanseddon: how would i reapply it?
[22:11:26] <khurram> thanks :)
[22:12:00] <ngharo> Electissimi: right after you insert it via ajax or whatever
[22:12:00] <ryanseddon> Electissimi: if you're loading it through ajax then do it on the success callback and apply it to the element once it's inserted
[22:12:47] <khurram> coldhead: what i change the async to false ?
[22:13:38] <coldhead> still can't be done, khurram

[22:18:28] <Electissimi> I didn't use $.ajax
[22:18:35] <Electissimi> how would i get the onsuccess?
[22:18:35] <ryanseddon> Electissimi: $.post is a shorthand for $.ajax
[22:18:50] <Electissimi> ah ok stupid me :)
[22:19:04] <ryanseddon> the last argument is a callnack that gets run onsuccess so you're already doing it
[22:19:08] <ryanseddon> callback?
[22:19:24] <ryanseddon> that ? should of been a *
[22:20:53] <ryanseddon> Electissimi: after the insert of the data rerun the fancybox method
[22:21:24] <Electissimi> ryanseddon: should i make the fancybox method a function?
[22:21:47] <ryanseddon> $("element").fancybox()
[22:22:06] <ryanseddon> like how you initialised it on page load

[22:27:32] <da-beginner> hi, is it possible to aggregate two events together?
[22:27:41] <JEET> do I have to create a php script? actually I am new to jquery do not aware of all apis and functions
[22:27:53] <da-beginner> i have a keypress on a dropdown AND a click on a button which basically does the same thing
[22:28:18] <da-beginner> do i need to declare two, or can i integrate it to a single statement?
[22:29:01] <ryanseddon> da-beginner: $("element").bind("keypress click",function(){})
[22:29:15] <ryanseddon> you can then check the event.type to which event it is
[22:29:55] <da-beginner> ryanseddon: can i also do $("element","item).bind("keypress click", function(){}) ?
[22:30:18] <da-beginner> what's the right syntax for it?
[22:30:35] <ryanseddon> are you trying to bind events to multiple elements?
[22:32:08] <da-beginner> i want to bind multiple elements with different events to a single function
[22:32:34] <da-beginner> just a keypress on a dropdown, and a click on a button

[22:45:23] <tbranyen> actually just over a week
[22:45:24] <pilgo> tbranyen: wow!
[22:45:34] <tbranyen> up 347 days
[22:45:39] <pilgo> network uptime or just computer uptime?
[22:45:44] <tbranyen> computer
[22:45:59] <tbranyen> i think it hiccuped once or twice in the past year
[22:46:17] <pilgo> tbranyen: How bad? How long were things down for?
[22:46:43] <tbranyen> probably less than an hour
[22:46:47] <tbranyen> it was insignifcant for me
[22:48:46] <KingDosser> Can I please get help with this: http://pastie.org/private/zkvfqgrfo6sziltveqybq I am getting the error: missing ; before statement
[22:49:00] <KingDosser> dont worry
[22:49:21] <tbranyen> be happy
[22:49:36] <tbranyen> uh KingDosser
[22:49:40] <khurram> i found the jquery.form plugin which handles the fileuploads as well
[22:49:47] <tbranyen> $.post('...', function() {
[22:49:56] <tbranyen> also wtf
[22:50:21] <khurram> now can any please tell me where should i put the javascript code for the form to submit in the original form or in the file where the is fetched using ajax call ?
[22:51:57] <tbranyen> KingDosser: also line 8
[22:52:01] <tbranyen> has an s or something at the end
[22:52:04] <tbranyen> looks like an s
[22:52:30] <KingDosser> We fixed it d/w :)
[22:52:34] <KingDosser> Cheers though tbranyen
[22:53:01] <tbranyen> KingDosser: also why are you using completely arbitrary setTimeouts with a post?
[22:53:11] <khurram> now can any please tell me where should i put the javascript code for the form to submit in the original form or in the file where the is fetched using ajax call ?
[22:53:18] <tbranyen> what if it takes an hour to upload?
[22:53:23] <tbranyen> and not 3 seconds
[22:54:05] <tbranyen> KingDosser: you really should be using the post callback
[22:54:09] <tbranyen> to display when someone is complete
[22:57:23] <KingDosser> Its not an upload. Its just calling a script which will do its own thing.
[23:01:34] <hash_> somebody  knows how  can i load a new html page before a form validation if the validation turns right?
[23:03:57] <khurram> coldhead: where should i put the line $('#newForm').ajaxForm(function());  in fhe file where the form is or the file where this forms come into div after ajax ?
[23:05:52] <khurram> coldhead: ?
[23:07:23] <coldhead> khurram: ? khurram: ? khurram: ? khurram: ? khurram: ? khurram: ?
[23:07:35] <coldhead> have some fucking patience, man
[23:07:45] <khurram> sorry Champ today i have no luck with me
[23:07:57] <khurram> im sorry
[23:08:22] <coldhead> it shouldn't matter where you have that line
[23:08:34] <coldhead> you probably want it where your other form stuff is
[23:08:39] <khurram> then why its acting as a dead
[23:09:04] <khurram> nothing happening when i click on submit
[23:09:11] <coldhead> you need it to be inside a $(document).ready() to make sure the element is on the page
[23:09:20] <coldhead> when the JS runs
[23:09:36] <khurram> the element comes from an ajax call
[23:09:41] <coldhead> you can also try to run that line from the console once the page is loaded to see if it works then
[23:09:56] <coldhead> ah then you probably need to run that line in the ajax success callback
[23:10:03] <khurram> in document.ready that element  of form is not there it comes from an ajax call
[23:10:06] <coldhead> so it will be run after the element is added
[23:10:14] <khurram> yes
[23:10:21] <khurram> you are always great
[23:10:29] <khurram> thanks love
[23:10:33] <coldhead> i am sorry i cursed, khurram
[23:10:45] <coldhead> but you only need to mention my nick once to get my attention
[23:10:53] <coldhead> more times is annoying
[23:11:06] <khurram> never mind :)
[23:11:21] <Justin_> I'm having a problem with jscrollpane where when I specify the max-height, the scroll bar still appears even before the max height has been reached
[23:12:32] <Justin_> is there any way to fix this?
[23:13:37] <Justin_> hellloooo
[23:13:55] <coldhead> i am not familiar with jscrollpane, babe
[23:14:01] <coldhead> do you have a link to your demo?
[23:14:46] <Justin_> coldhead: I don't :/
[23:15:29] <coldhead> can you get something up on jsfiddle?
[23:15:41] <coldhead> otherwise we have to imagine the problem
[23:15:45] <coldhead> and in my mind it works fine :)
[23:19:37] <khurram> coldhead: its working like a charm even the file is getting uploaded this plugin is AWESOMELY INTELLIgent
[23:19:39] <coldhead> a heart is not a plaything, a heart is not a toy, but if you want yours broken, just give it to a boy
[23:19:52] <coldhead> oh good job, khurram
[23:20:05] <coldhead> you should write a blog post explaining your success or something
[23:21:05] <khurram> :)
[23:21:27] <khurram> then on the blog post every one will comment that all what coldhead told him ;)
[23:22:10] <coldhead> aw i'm just like the feather in dumbo, you think you need me but you don't
