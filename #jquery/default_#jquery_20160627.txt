[04:01:11] <dranve> hello guys, just a quick tip please, i want to preserve integer in <div data-something="11"></div>  and to be able to access it later on in the code, i have seen some issues with .data() and .attr()  setting and getting the value.. however, what ever i do, which ever combination, it keeps the values as when page was loaded... please help
[05:15:27] <LeGorilla> hey guys, what does is mean when browser shows alert 0
[05:15:40] <LeGorilla> I get this when I run an ajax request
[05:16:13] <LeGorilla> I actually get multiple one, and I have to close them off
[05:16:29] <systemfault> Well.. you have alerts in your code probably.
[05:16:36] <systemfault> JQuery doesn't alert
[05:17:20] <LeGorilla> no I don't have any alerts
[05:17:43] <systemfault> Then explain.
[05:18:18] <systemfault> I guess que c'est ça qui arrive quand tu fais du JS à 5 heure du matin.
[05:18:38] <LeGorilla> :) possible
[05:19:43] <LeGorilla> how can I explain this, I have an on change function
[05:20:12] <LeGorilla> that returns a bunch of info and populate a list of select fields
[05:20:32] <LeGorilla> and each time a select is populated it runs the same function and so on
[05:21:02] <LeGorilla> but for some values, I got multiple alert(0)
[05:22:18] <systemfault> Hmm.
[05:22:30] <systemfault> Is there any way you could use a pastebin to show us the relevant codeÉ
[05:22:32] <systemfault> ?
[05:23:10] <LeGorilla> hmmm wait, this only happened on the remote server
[05:23:15] <LeGorilla> not the localhost
[07:35:18] <_mariacheline> Hi, i'm clearly doing something wrong here the icons just dont respond right, can somebody help?
[07:35:20] <_mariacheline> http://codepen.io/mariacheline/pen/vKgozQ?editors=0100
[07:48:04] <Cork> _mariacheline: the icons isn't visible so how do you expect click to fire on them?
[07:48:56] <_mariacheline> Cork, icons are visible on my pc
[07:49:39] <Cork> by what?
[07:49:48] <Cork> the css has     .fa-bars { display: none; }
[08:20:48] <_mariacheline> Thanks Cork, made it :)
[09:37:53] <Myz> Hello,
[09:39:24] <Myz> I'm new in jquery and i would like to do a simple thing. I would like on image click: 1. block Ui with a var time, once it done show a div below image and swap the image. is it possible ?
[09:42:03] <arc_> from codeacademy's jquery module: "Learn how to make your websites interactive and create animations by using jQuery."
[09:42:49] <arc_> seems misleading regarding the purpose of jquery
[09:43:23] <Myz> ok thank I will check :)
[09:43:33] <arc_> i'm sorry, that wasn't an answer to your question
[09:44:09] <Myz> ah ok xD
[09:45:14] <jose3_> what do you guys thing of this function I have built? How can I make it less offensive?  https://gist.github.com/toymechqm/1b95345ce4f2c7a3e42a20d3063bf5d5
[09:54:22] <Cork> jose3_: why not use .serializeArray() ?
[09:54:46] <jose3_> you mean for those really long variables I have?
[09:55:03] <Cork> no, i mean to replace all that manual serialization you do
[09:55:21] <Cork> (line 4-61)
[09:57:00] <jose3_> Cork: Great thanks Ill look into that!
[10:29:59] <km4> guy how can I edit css attr in my div ? have <div class="col-md-10 no xyz foo baa" id="qwe"></div> and I need target only col-md-10 ?
[10:30:20] <km4> click and change col-md-10 > col-md-12 ?
[10:30:29] <Cork> you can't edit a class with .css
[10:30:43] <Cork> ah, you need to replace a class?
[10:31:02] <Cork> .removeClass('col-md-10').addClass('col-md-12')
[10:31:39] <km4> ye replace/changes
[10:32:04] <km4> in less I take class*="col-md" :P
[10:32:15] <Cork> you shouldn't ever use class*=
[10:32:17] <Cork> ever
[10:32:31] <Cork> if you need to it means you have structured your classes wrong
[10:32:56] <km4> how can I toggle this class ?
[10:33:03] <Cork> i already told you
[10:33:11] <km4> ah ok
[10:42:58] <jquery387> Hi, is there any way in datatable.js to export to excel throught excelHtml5 a date so it will become into excel's date object and not a string of date?
[10:44:14] <jquery387> !help
[10:45:26] <jquery387> Hi, is there any way in datatable.js to export to excel throught excelHtml5 a date so it will become into excel's date object and not a string of date?
[11:04:11] <jquery387> Hi, is there any way in datatable.js to export to excel throught excelHtml5 a date so it will become into excel's date object and not a string of date?
[11:39:52] <jose3_> Cork:
[11:40:35] <jose3_> Cork:  Thanks for the serialize bit, that helped, i didn't realize I cand use it that way
[11:50:23] * jose3_ is there a more efficient/better way to write this? https://gist.github.com/toymechqm/85d97606278e84bfa78d0aaba18eaca8
[11:52:54] <robertmaxrees> any reason you're not using .on()?
[11:52:58] <robertmaxrees> or does mousetrap have some kind of funky api?
[11:54:46] <jose3_> robertmaxrees: well- I want a combined key combination this seemed like a simple solution. what are you suggesting?
[11:54:46] <robertmaxrees> so .on() is preferred over .bind these days, and you could combine those first three handlers into one if you can use it.
[11:55:01] <jose3_> mousetrap makes me use bind
[11:55:05] <robertmaxrees> okay.
[11:55:08] <robertmaxrees> that's why i asked.
[11:55:17] <jose3_> well i just tested it
[11:55:21] <robertmaxrees> ...
[11:55:22] <robertmaxrees> lol
[11:55:42] <robertmaxrees> oh, it can take an array.
[11:55:49] <robertmaxrees> you could combine those first three into one anyway.
[11:57:30] <jose3_> robertmaxrees:  in what way?
[11:58:07] <robertmaxrees> if I'm reading the docs correctly, Mousetrap.bind(['shift+left', 'shift+right'], function(e) {
[11:58:08] <robertmaxrees> etc
[12:04:51] <_eddy> hi guys has anyone used this jquery library before
[12:04:51] <_eddy> https://github.com/luis-kaufmann-silva/jquery-p2r
[12:07:45] <robertmaxrees> looks like some folks have.
[12:08:16] <_eddy> what do you mean robertmaxrees
[12:08:31] <robertmaxrees> the repo has some stars and followers.
[12:09:44] <robertmaxrees> did you have a question about it?
[12:13:24] <_eddy> robertmaxrees, i think i can figure it out
[12:13:28] <robertmaxrees> cool :)
[12:16:52] <_eddy> maybe not robertmaxrees
[12:17:00] <robertmaxrees> what's up?
[12:17:04] <_eddy> http://codepen.io/luiskaufmannsilva/pen/cIxqe am trying to get it to work on mobile
[12:17:13] <_eddy> if you have chrome just change it to mobile view
[12:17:22] <_eddy> and try pulling it
[12:17:33] <_eddy> seem to work on a browser
[12:18:39] <robertmaxrees> okay?
[12:18:42] <robertmaxrees> what's the problem?
[12:19:16] <_eddy> http://codepen.io/luiskaufmannsilva/full/cIxqe/
[12:19:21] <_eddy> its not pulling
[12:19:23] <robertmaxrees> that works fine for me.
[12:19:31] <_eddy> on mobile?
[12:19:37] <_eddy> or mobile view
[12:19:40] <_eddy> ?
[12:19:46] <robertmaxrees> mobile view works fine.
[12:19:57] <robertmaxrees> are you saying it doesn't work on a mobile defice?
[12:20:03] <_eddy> interesting doesnt doesnt for me
[12:20:16] <robertmaxrees> you have to drag on the area with text.
[12:20:22] <robertmaxrees> also make sure you reload after starting emulation.
[12:20:45] <_eddy> thanks
[12:20:51] <robertmaxrees> that fix it?
[12:21:18] <_eddy> yep needed to refresh
[12:21:22] <robertmaxrees> ah.
[12:21:23] <robertmaxrees> yeah.
[12:21:42] <robertmaxrees> emulation mode doesn't properly fix everything.  gotta have the browser redo the request and init everything correctly.
[12:22:55] <_eddy> thanks just want to refresh the page
[12:23:10] <_eddy> after the percentage gets to 200
[12:38:34] <_eddy> robertmaxrees, this plugin is causing another issue. maybe you might be able to suggest something
[12:38:54] <_eddy> basically the select is on the html body
[12:38:59] <robertmaxrees> feel free to just ask the channel :) if somebody can help, they will :)
[12:39:47] <_eddy> and i have a pop up form. this pull to refresh plugin stops me from update the input and select field in the pop form
[12:40:07] <_eddy> any suggestion
[12:41:21] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[12:45:04] <_eddy> go pulling but it has some issues
[12:46:05] <robertmaxrees> right, what're the issues?  something about an input?
[12:56:37] <_eddy> will look into it might be a css issue
[13:16:10] <geri> hi, why i get the following error for this code? $.alert('This is jQuery MsgBox alert.'); error: Uncaught TypeError: $.alert is not a function
[13:16:20] <robertmaxrees> because $.alert() isn't a thing.
[13:16:42] <robertmaxrees> if you included a plugin that should make that work, make sure you include it before your code.
[13:17:02] <geri> http://raw.githack.com/composite/jQuery.MsgBox/master/jquery.msgbox.min.js ?
[13:17:16] <robertmaxrees> if you included a plugin that should make that work, make sure you include it before your code.
[13:47:03] <tables> anyone know any infinite scroll implementation that just keeps loading pages?
[13:47:06] <tables> a simple one
[13:47:10] <robertmaxrees> there are lots out there.
[13:47:17] <robertmaxrees> the basic gist is pretty simply though
[13:48:15] <robertmaxrees> though I generally caution people to avoid infinite scroll setups in a lot of cases
[14:29:24] <ndstudio> anyone have experience with canvas and jquery plugin callbacks?
[14:30:22] <robertmaxrees> jquery and canvas don't play particularly well together.  that being said, could you be a little more specific?
[14:30:32] <ndstudio> sure,
[14:30:40] <ndstudio> like for example. i have a loop
[14:30:44] <ndstudio> in the plugin
[14:30:54] <ndstudio> and I'd like for the user using a callback
[14:31:08] <ndstudio> to add their own interaction
[14:31:31] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[14:31:54] <ndstudio> like if the user wanted to add something to the canvas
[14:32:28] <robertmaxrees> so you're enumerating over canvas objects and you want the user to be able to edit the canvast through the callback?
[14:32:34] <robertmaxrees> *canvas
[14:32:36] <ndstudio> my issue is that. once the canvas has been created within the plugin, then how does the user add more interaction to the canvas during its lifespan
[14:32:47] <ndstudio> yes
[14:32:50] <robertmaxrees> so my first big piece of advice is to not use jquery for this.
[14:33:24] <ndstudio> how come?
[14:33:35] <robertmaxrees> becuase jquery an canvas don't get along with one another.
[14:34:31] <ndstudio> understood, but is there a way to actually get this to work?
[14:35:07] <robertmaxrees> sure.  depends on how you want to design your API, but plenty of plugins do that.
[14:36:53] <ndstudio> I just want to have basic entry points like, add, get, remove, size,
[14:36:54] <robertmaxrees> jquery ui has a factory for creating stateful plugins, or if you don't want to include all of JQUI just for that ability you could find a place to store data in the page yourself.
[14:37:01] <ndstudio> its going to be a particle system
[14:37:12] <robertmaxrees> yeah, depends on how you design your API.
[14:37:47] <robertmaxrees> you'll have to store that data in an object somewhere.
[14:40:56] <ndstudio> so like, is it possible to add a click() from within a callback
[14:41:12] <robertmaxrees> sure.  that's an awkward api design though.
[14:41:38] <robertmaxrees> though you're doing canvas with jquery so something tells me you've accepted that hahaha.
[14:51:04] <Manaus> hi guys, I need to find out if a textarea contains an email address [done] and in case, put that address in a variable [how]?
[14:56:09] <tables> what is a good infinite scrolling implementation that i can use that loads pages?
[15:07:51] <ndstudio> understood, robertmaxrees
[15:08:00] <ndstudio> so the question becomes how… lol
[15:15:59] <z1haze_work> when using jquery ui dialog, im trying to embed a youtube video using the open: event handler, but nothing seems to be happening. Do I not have access to the elements in the dialog in this method?
[15:33:35] <_August_> anyone here familiar with highcharts? im trying to render my chart but im having no luck getting the chart to show. https://jsfiddle.net/naavq4pj/4/
[15:36:39] <shoky> _August_: have you checked your console for errors?
[15:37:17] <_August_> yeah, nothing comes up
[15:37:41] <shoky> _August_: in the jsfiddle? i'm seeing Uncaught ReferenceError: $ is not defined
[15:38:05] <shoky> z1haze_work: you do have access to it
[15:39:14] <_August_> i think its missing the jquery library on jsfiddle
[15:39:26] <_August_> but on my site when i test it, no errors come up
[15:39:33] <shoky> we can only see the jsfiddle, not your site
[15:43:20] <shoky> _August_: try logging your data that you're passing to Highcharts.Chart
[15:43:26] <shoky> see if it looks right
[15:43:45] <shoky> _August_: did it for you here  https://jsfiddle.net/naavq4pj/5/
[15:45:10] <_August_> yeah but the chart itself isnt howing
[15:45:28] <shoky> _August_: yeah, because your options are wrong. do what i said
[15:46:47] <z1haze_work> when you close a jquery dialog, does it actually delete itself or just go hidden?
[15:46:57] <shoky> just hidden
[15:47:21] <z1haze_work> Im having an issue here: http://dev04-web-kendo.demandware.net/on/demandware.store/Sites-MJB-Site/default/Search-ShowContent?fdid=videos where im trying to change videos in the dialog, but for some reason only the first time you open a dialog it works, after that it goes blank?
[15:47:43] <z1haze_work> Any thoughts?
[15:52:28] <shoky> _August_: here's one way.. https://jsfiddle.net/naavq4pj/6/
[15:54:36] <_August_> shoky, everything looks good
[15:54:56] <_August_> ohh you did it O_o
[15:55:02] <shoky> _August_: in the previous fiddle?  the series looks good?
[15:55:21] <_August_> i dont get it, why wasnt it showing?
[15:55:29] <shoky> because the series data was all wrong..
[15:55:36] <Ales> should i use js for this? there is database where u type data and it returns true or false (api). I want to read data from file and type data in this area every 1 min and search then do action depending if api returns true or false
[15:56:21] <_August_> in what way? it still looks the same
[15:56:44] <shoky> _August_: did you look in the console at the logged data?  and the series property in there?
[15:57:10] <shoky> it was:  ["Breakdown", true, {...}]
[15:57:17] <shoky> does that look good to you?
[15:58:33] <_August_> i dont have that in my json
[15:58:34] <shoky> now it's:  [{name: "Breakdown", data: [...]}]   as it should be
[15:58:41] <_August_> not even on the previous ones
[15:58:44] <shoky> i said look in the console, not look at your json
[15:59:20] <shoky> i'm logging the actual data that's passed to highcharts
[15:59:38] <_August_> ohh ok
[15:59:40] <_August_> i see it now
[15:59:49] <_August_> my mistake
[16:00:04] <_August_> thank you, i appreciate it
[16:00:21] <shoky> sure
[16:34:01] <ndstudio> was able to get jquery plugin callbacks to interface with the canvas context :)
[16:34:04] <ndstudio> happy day
[16:34:26] <robertmaxrees> heh
[16:34:28] <robertmaxrees> awesome.
[16:34:32] <robertmaxrees> figure it out?
[16:34:41] <ndstudio> yeah for the most part
[16:34:56] <robertmaxrees> wound up just storing a reference in an object somewhere?  or what.
[16:36:04] <ndstudio> yeah basically
[16:36:04] <robertmaxrees> figured.
[16:36:04] <ndstudio> I was having issues with my objects and scope
[16:36:04] <robertmaxrees> ah
[16:36:04] <ndstudio> i ended up just accessing the main options object from the plugin and using that to call the callback function from with the plugin
[16:36:30] <robertmaxrees> glad you figured it out.
[16:36:54] <ndstudio> so i can now execute user defined options within the callback for events like click and hover etc...
[16:37:26] <robertmaxrees> just be careful since jquery vs canvas blah blah blah
[16:37:31] <ndstudio> you were right, its not very intuitive…
[16:37:32] <ndstudio> yeah
[16:37:34] <ndstudio> totally
[16:37:36] <robertmaxrees> exactly.
[16:37:41] <robertmaxrees> jquery is for DOM.
[16:37:43] <robertmaxrees> canvas is not DOM.
[16:37:47] <robertmaxrees> hence the jank.
[16:37:48] <ndstudio> right
[16:37:54] <robertmaxrees> and with that, brb
[16:38:04] <ndstudio> aight
[16:41:46] <robertmaxrees> back
[16:44:50] <z1haze_work> I need help, Im using google iframe api to load videos in a jquery ui dialog panel, but I dont know why it only works for the first dialog open, after that its a empty div, please have a look: http://dev04-web-kendo.demandware.net/on/demandware.store/Sites-MJB-Site/default/Search-ShowContent?fdid=videos
[16:45:39] <Ales> how do i find api of website if they dont release it to public
[16:45:52] <robertmaxrees> Ales that's... a weird question.
[16:45:54] <z1haze_work> lol
[16:46:01] <robertmaxrees> Ales they may not have a public one for you to use.
[16:46:06] <Ales> there is
[16:46:10] <robertmaxrees> lol
[16:46:13] <robertmaxrees> and what site is it?
[16:46:17] <Ales> my friend uses it but he aint telling me because of 'competition'
[16:46:22] <robertmaxrees> what's the site?
[16:46:38] <z1haze_work> Robert can you peak into my issue?
[16:46:38] <Ales> im doing inspect element on chrome and networking ..
[16:46:42] <robertmaxrees> he may have reverse engineered it.
[16:46:49] <robertmaxrees> reading source and stuff.
[16:46:58] <Ales> no he said he copy, if you're not 99% retarded you'll find it
[16:47:19] <robertmaxrees> Ales then copy it?
[16:47:22] <z1haze_work> Ales, again what site is this?
[16:47:24] <robertmaxrees> z1haze_work i'm poking at it.  links to files controlling this?
[16:47:25] <Ales> where..?
[16:47:37] <z1haze_work> i will make a paste
[16:47:38] <robertmaxrees> Ales i'd guess the source for the site.
[16:47:50] <robertmaxrees> watch network requests grep through js files.
[16:47:52] <robertmaxrees> easy stuff.
[16:47:52] <Ales> what should i do.. robertmaxrees  z1haze_work
[16:47:59] <Ales> there is many
[16:48:05] <robertmaxrees> then start workin'.
[16:48:08] <z1haze_work> robertmaxrees: my export module: http://dpaste.com/3DGTC5J
[16:48:33] <z1haze_work> and on open: on jquery dialog i execute initPlayer() and on doc ready i execute init()
[16:48:54] <z1haze_work> err excuse me, on doc ready i run init() then on dialog open i run setup() which calls the initPlayer
[16:48:58] <robertmaxrees> z1haze_work i'd maybe check to see if the elements are getting clobbered or something.
[16:49:22] <z1haze_work> well as you can see when you reopen the dialog the contents of #player are back to a normal div again
[16:49:43] <robertmaxrees> also i get the feeling that you're not using this correctly for multiple videos but i could be wrong.
[16:49:44] <z1haze_work> i think I need to new up a new player
[16:49:50] <robertmaxrees> window.onYouTubePlayerAPIReady = function () { this feels wrong.
[16:50:04] <z1haze_work> you have to call that method on the window object
[16:50:08] <z1haze_work> and since im inside a function
[16:50:19] <robertmaxrees> you have access to the window upbject
[16:50:28] <robertmaxrees> oh you mean the videoID and shit.
[16:50:30] <robertmaxrees> hrnm.
[16:50:37] <robertmaxrees> something here feels off but i'm not sure waht.
[16:50:38] <z1haze_work> no just the onYouTubeAPIReady
[16:50:39] <robertmaxrees> *what
[16:50:53] <z1haze_work> if you dont use window, when your inside another function you get undefined function or something
[16:50:55] <z1haze_work> i found it on SO
[16:50:59] <robertmaxrees> right i know.
[16:51:03] <robertmaxrees> that's not what i was pointing out.
[16:51:06] <z1haze_work> ah ok
[16:51:33] <z1haze_work> basically, serverside refreshed view for the dialog
[16:51:38] <z1haze_work> each modal open
[16:51:43] <z1haze_work> because it changes the id, etc
[16:52:03] <robertmaxrees> i get the feeling your issue is with the youtube api and not jqui but i have no idea.
[16:52:04] <z1haze_work> before i was just loading an iframe from from the template
[16:52:18] <z1haze_work> I think my issue lies with me not newing up a new player instance
[16:52:30] <z1haze_work> because it only seems to run once because of onYouttubePlayerAPIReady
[16:52:35] <robertmaxrees> right.
[16:52:38] <z1haze_work> but i just noticed that talkign to you
[16:52:42] <z1haze_work> ill see if i can rework it thanks
[16:52:56] <Ales> ...
[16:53:23] <z1haze_work> this client wants some real confusing shit, they want to be able to seek the video with buttons on their site, and auto change products on the right side of the screen for the 'in this step'
[16:53:37] <z1haze_work> how im going to do that, i dont know but im gettin closer
[16:54:16] <z1haze_work> Ales: generally you dont pm people without asking
[16:54:17] <robertmaxrees> Ales what are you trying to accomplish?
[16:54:29] <Ales> z1haze_work, its not jquery question buddy. help me out
[16:54:38] <robertmaxrees> then you're in the wrong place :)
[16:54:39] <robertmaxrees> enjoy.
[16:54:59] <Ales> where shud i ask
[16:55:00] <Ales> ?
[16:55:27] <robertmaxrees> i dunno but you just said it's not a jquery question sooo.
[16:55:56] <Ales> robertmaxrees, he said it is not in .js, where it could be then?
[16:56:07] <robertmaxrees> where is WHAT?!  WHAT API. WHAT IS IT DOING.
[16:56:08] <Ales> z1haze_work,
[16:56:13] <robertmaxrees> you haven't answered any of those questions.
[16:56:26] <robertmaxrees> you keep repeating the same thing over and over expecting us to know wtf you're talking about.
[16:56:47] <robertmaxrees> https://secure.runescape.com/m=account-creation/g=oldscape/create_account?trialactive=true
[16:56:47] <Ales> like api gives response if name/email exists
[16:56:56] <robertmaxrees> it's a form.
[16:56:58] <robertmaxrees> easy stuff.
[16:57:38] <z1haze_work> Hmm, on robertmaxrees so according to youtube https://developers.google.com/youtube/iframe_api_reference#Getting_Started in order to load a player you call this onYouTubeIframeAPIReady function .. but what happens when i am refreshing the contents of this dialog, so its giong back to just <div id="player"></div> BUT the api has already been loaded
[16:57:39] <z1haze_work> so this method wont trigger again..
[16:57:58] <robertmaxrees> z1haze_work yeah that sounds about right.
[16:57:58] <z1haze_work> i need to check if the api is already loaded, and if it is, create a new video instance
[16:58:07] <hmmwhatsthisdo|W> If I define a deferred object and then use $.when() to initialize a callback for when the deferred object completes, will it be a problem if the deferred object has already completed when the callback is registered?
[16:58:22] <z1haze_work> not sure how i will do a double check on this though
[16:58:34] <robertmaxrees> hmmwhatsthisdo|W nope - since promises only resolve once you're fine.  that's part of what makes them nice.
[16:58:36] <hmmwhatsthisdo|W> or will jQuery still execute the callback as expected?
[16:58:40] <hmmwhatsthisdo|W> fabulous
[16:59:07] <hmmwhatsthisdo|W> ...trying to make something that depends on 3 or 4 different things happening and getting them all to synchronize using the page's event API is a fucking nightmare
[16:59:16] <hmmwhatsthisdo|W> s/the page/this site
[16:59:21] <z1haze_work> I guess i should probably rework how the backend updates the dom.. i could probably just use a data-attr on the page load and not worry about a freakin server call
[17:00:19] <robertmaxrees> hmmwhatsthisdo|W yeah, exactly a use case for promises.
[17:01:53] <z1haze_work> ah i see whats happening
[17:02:47] <z1haze_work> this website is kind weird in the sense that it shares the same main codebase with 3 other websites (same owners, different brands) but it looks like someone has overwritten the default close() function for jquery ui dialog that runs a destroy method on it and remove
[17:03:06] <robertmaxrees> z1haze_work we do something very similar to that here.
[17:03:14] <robertmaxrees> the multiple sites out of one codebase i mean.
[17:03:20] <z1haze_work> how can i find out the default behavior (code) for close()
[17:03:34] <z1haze_work> i can put the default behavior back in and we have a variable i can check for the site id to only run for this site
[17:03:36] <robertmaxrees> why not get rid of the override?
[17:03:45] <z1haze_work> because the other 2 sites use it this way
[17:03:52] <robertmaxrees> or only init the override for the sites that need it?
[17:04:15] <z1haze_work> im not sure exactly how it works
[17:04:20] <z1haze_work> but we have an entire dialog.js file
[17:04:24] <z1haze_work> with all of the methods
[17:04:29] <z1haze_work> create, submit, close, open, etc
[17:04:32] <robertmaxrees> is that from a plugin maybe?
[17:04:42] <z1haze_work> its the jquery ui dialog yea
[17:04:48] <z1haze_work> but im thinking they are overwriting default behaviors
[17:04:48] <robertmaxrees> it's the default one you mean?
[17:04:56] <robertmaxrees> then find out where they're doing that?
[17:07:27] <z1haze_work> hmm
[17:07:33] <z1haze_work> i figured it would just do it by default
[17:09:00] <z1haze_work> this codebase is such a cluster fk though
[17:09:06] <robertmaxrees> haha
[17:09:28] <z1haze_work> how can i look what the default behavior for close() is?
[17:09:38] <robertmaxrees> by looking at the source for jqui.
[17:09:41] <robertmaxrees> but you don't wnat to copy it.
[17:09:50] <z1haze_work> no?
[17:09:53] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[17:09:56] <z1haze_work> why is that
[17:09:59] <robertmaxrees> you want to find out where it's being overridden.
[17:10:34] <z1haze_work> in dialog.js we create our own var dialog object
[17:11:13] <z1haze_work> i dunno man its so bad here have a look lol http://dpaste.com/1ASCHE3
[17:11:38] <z1haze_work> dialog is defined at line 41 though
[17:12:10] <robertmaxrees> this isn't terrible/.  it's not great, but serviceable.
[17:12:47] <z1haze_work> i get yelled at anytime i try to fix formatting to imrpove existing stuff, they bitch about having to look at changesets to see whats changed
[17:13:00] <robertmaxrees> yep.  some places are like that.
[17:13:10] <robertmaxrees> either way, sounds like you want to conditionally init the close method.
[17:13:44] <robertmaxrees> ah but this defines its own custom dialog object anyway.
[17:13:52] <robertmaxrees> sooo how is this overriding $.fn.dialog
[17:14:05] <z1haze_work> yea the whole thing is instantiated with like dialog.create
[17:14:13] <z1haze_work> using this object
[17:14:30] <z1haze_work> i just want to find the default behavior throw it in here in an if condition
[17:14:31] <z1haze_work> and move on
[17:14:33] <robertmaxrees> wait what does any of this have to do with your problem?  you're trying to reinit the youtube stuff.
[17:14:43] <robertmaxrees> and this isn't the default jqui dialog so the default close method may not work.
[17:14:47] <z1haze_work> well im thinking back
[17:14:57] <z1haze_work> i have no point to have to refresh the modal view
[17:15:02] <z1haze_work> i dont need to hit the server at all
[17:15:15] <robertmaxrees> none of that has anything to do with my question :)
[17:15:23] <z1haze_work> lol yea it does here me out
[17:15:37] <z1haze_work> currently, when you click to open the model, it hits the server, the server returns the view the view is passed into the dialog
[17:15:47] <z1haze_work> which we are losing anythin ginside of my <player> div
[17:16:03] <z1haze_work> the only thing its doing (for this site) is just updating hte video id and the title, etc
[17:16:19] <z1haze_work> no i take that back all its going is updating the video id
[17:16:21] <robertmaxrees> still not addressing anything about my question ;) you need to fix the init for the youtube api.
[17:16:28] <robertmaxrees> that's all.
[17:16:40] <z1haze_work> yea but if i dont hit hte server and refresh my dialog container, i wont have to fix init
[17:16:47] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[17:16:49] <robertmaxrees> yeah you will.
[17:16:58] <robertmaxrees> you'll have to touch the init code in some way.
[17:17:08] <z1haze_work> it will remain existant and i can just use player.loadVideoById(videoId);
[17:17:33] <z1haze_work> i will use the same player the whole time
[17:17:38] <z1haze_work> and just cange its contents
[17:18:40] <z1haze_work> the crap of it is, these other sites were build before i started, and this page is build entirely different on the site im on, so i dont want to use their ways of doing things, they dont even fit the needs
[17:19:41] <robertmaxrees> heh.
[17:19:44] <robertmaxrees> fair enough.
[17:20:15] <z1haze_work> http://dpaste.com/2N0SWWD
[17:20:35] <z1haze_work> dunno if thats it
[17:22:00] <z1haze_work> OOo i think i found it http://dpaste.com/0RW69AZ
[17:25:53] <z1haze_work> hate to say it, but f it. guess ill just adapt to it
[18:08:30] <z1haze_work> Anyone know how it would be possible to trigger an event based on certain times in a youtube video thats iframed?
[18:10:02] <robertmaxrees> not seeing anything in their api docs.
[18:10:20] <robertmaxrees> you'd have to check periodically yourself manually.
[18:25:19] <z1haze_work> well robertmaxrees im stuck at the point with wanting to automatically fire an event
[18:25:27] <z1haze_work> clicking a button i can trigger an event
[18:25:30] <robertmaxrees> right.
[18:25:35] <robertmaxrees> there's no event for "hit this time"
[18:25:43] <z1haze_work> the goal is to shop a product in a sidebar with whatever 'step' of the video they are showing
[18:25:52] <z1haze_work> show*
[18:26:07] <z1haze_work> like if they are doing lipstick, they want to show this lipstick live in the sidebar so peple can buy it
[18:26:19] <robertmaxrees> right.  as far as I know, youtube doesn't do that.
[18:26:41] <z1haze_work> http://www.dior.com/beauty/en_us/th/dior_makeup_how_to.html#expand/dior-addict-lipstick-by-hanneli
[18:26:55] <arc_> i'm surprised they don't have that honestly, since they allow you to add annotations and they obviously play ads based on the time in the video
[18:28:09] <robertmaxrees> z1haze_work then look at the source that modifies those.
[18:28:20] <z1haze_work> its obfuscated lol
[18:28:28] <robertmaxrees> the deobfuscate it?
[18:28:49] <z1haze_work> i dont even know how
[18:29:11] <robertmaxrees> your browser has a build-is deobfuscator to at least get you part of the way there.
[18:29:14] <arc_> can you deobfuscate it? i know you can unminify
[18:29:22] <robertmaxrees> *unminify.
[18:29:28] <robertmaxrees> which should be just enouhgh in this case.
[18:29:42] <arc_> it's a button that looks like {}
[18:30:04] <arc_> next to the line/column display
[18:30:17] <arc_> (in chrome)
[18:30:24] <robertmaxrees> similar place in ff.
[18:32:38] <robertmaxrees> yeah, there's some handlebars funk in here and then there's some js that renders stuff for you.
[18:34:43] <robertmaxrees> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10175367/youtube-api-event-on-a-specified-time some good info here.
[18:45:08] <z1haze_work> talk to you all tomorrow, calling ita night
[19:51:33] <newbsie> Is this <input type="email" maxlength="200" name="email" class="email same" placeholder="Your email">, jquery validation? I can't find any documentation alluding to this, but I have no other explanation....
[21:22:12] <Anubis-86_> Hi!, looking for testers for an advanced-easy hosting provider that I've just launched
[22:11:33] <homm_berger> hey gang, does anyone know how i'd target the image URL in here? http://pastebin.com/raw/kPJw9Zf6
[22:11:39] <homm_berger> having a bit of trouble as i'm a newbie
[22:12:12] <homm_berger> inside that  " [swatch url=www.image.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Imagetograb.jpg] "
[22:19:39] <GeekMonkey> I am adding an a tag to the nav via .insert() the href is working but it is supposed to open a magnific popup it has the proper class... but I believe that since I am adding it via jquery it is not working
[22:19:43] <GeekMonkey> any help?
[22:30:21] <average> so can I return a $.Deferred()  just because I need to continue the chain ?
[23:41:50] <homm_berger> so geekmonkey suggested a method earlier of targeting a url but i can't for the life of me get it to work. this is what i have so far               var fabric_source = $("div[class='owl-carousel center'] img").attr("src");              and this is the HTML with the URL i'm targeting
[23:41:59] <homm_berger> http://pastebin.com/raw/kPJw9Zf6
[23:42:12] <homm_berger> it keeps returning undefined, i'm not sure how to tell what is and isn't reading
[23:42:17] <homm_berger> when i use that selection as CSS it seems to target appropriately so i'm not quite sure
[23:52:28] <al_nz1> I watched this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZXj9ojFFk8 where he went to the site jqueryui.com and it had CDNs at the bottom of the page in the video. They are no longer on the website now. How do you get the CDNs?
[23:52:54] <al_nz1> (the website is shown at about ~1:30)
[23:53:23] <jak2013> i want close a tab after 15 seconds, how to do it? window.opener='self';   window.close();   how to use setTimeOut?
