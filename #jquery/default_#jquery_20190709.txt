[10:03:13] <gypsymauro> hi
[10:04:03] <gypsymauro> i dunno if it is the correct place where to ask, but I think I've some problems betwwen jquery and bootstrap, I'm trying to use some examples of bootstrap but not everything is working where can I find help ?
[10:05:34] <Cork> gypsymauro: i would prob recommend asking in ##bootstrap
[10:06:01] <Cork> you might find bootstrap users in here from time to time but i can't really help you
[10:08:49] <taplar> can you share your examples at least?
[10:10:06] <gypsymauro> uh
[10:10:20] <gypsymauro> with double #
[10:10:20] <gypsymauro> :D
[10:10:32] <gypsymauro> for this reason I wansn't able to find it
[10:17:50] <Cork> gypsymauro: unofficial channels use ## on freenode
[15:14:53] <Crystal> Hello - is anyone here familiar with the mobile css?
[15:15:00] <robertmaxrees> "the mobile css"??
[15:15:17] <Crystal> Jquery.mobile.structure
[15:15:29] <robertmaxrees> ah, jquery mobile's css.  what's your question? :)
[15:16:40] <Crystal> I have a script that changes the value of the select on a drop down menu based on the value of another - something in the mobile css is breaking in and I'm trying to pinpoint it
[15:17:05] <robertmaxrees> what do your dev tools tell you? :)
[15:17:17] <Crystal> if I'm understanding correctly the regular select is replaced by a "selectmenu"
[15:18:07] <Crystal> If I don't change the opacity on the .ui-select to 0, thereby hiding it, my script works but of course my drop down has no styling then
[15:18:24] <robertmaxrees> without seeing what you're doing, it's incredibly difficult to help.
[15:38:36] <Crystal> Alright, got it all uploaded. If you look at http://alexiselixirs.com/test/test4.php you can see the select script working as desired. In that I have removed the opacity:0 from .ui-select so that the original dropdown is being used
[15:39:27] <Crystal> If you look at http://alexiselxirs.com/test/test3.php you can see the stock css - which has the desired styling but breaks my script
[15:39:47] <Crystal> And the undefined variable error is unrelated this particular problem
[15:40:32] <Crystal> Sorry, http://alexiselixirs.com/test/test3.php
[15:41:21] <robertmaxrees> so how do i replicate your issue?
[15:41:33] <robertmaxrees> al, click the plus
[15:41:36] <robertmaxrees> *ah
[15:42:04] <Crystal> It needs to be seen on desktop because the @media is still broken on both
[15:42:12] <robertmaxrees> i'm looking at it on desktop :)
[15:42:26] <Crystal> Ok :)
[15:43:00] <robertmaxrees> so where's your code that's not working as you intended?
[15:43:34] <robertmaxrees> trying to make sure i fully understand the problem.
[15:43:37] <Crystal> If you look in the page source it's the last script tag before body ends
[15:43:51] <robertmaxrees> the change handler?
[15:43:55] <Crystal> yes
[15:44:01] <robertmaxrees> what does that have to do with the CSS?
[15:44:18] <Crystal> Well if you look at both examples you can see :p
[15:44:36] <robertmaxrees> that's not helpful - i'm looking at both examples.
[15:44:52] <Crystal> Okay well test4 works as intended
[15:44:58] <Crystal> It changes all the values
[15:45:12] <robertmaxrees> ah - so the "set all to" doesn't work in http://alexiselixirs.com/test/test3.php
[15:45:16] <robertmaxrees> this isn't a css issue.
[15:45:23] <robertmaxrees> you're just not using jqm correctly :)
[15:45:28] <Crystal> Yeah, it's something in the css
[15:45:32] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[15:45:38] <Crystal> Because it works for test4 but not test3
[15:45:48] <robertmaxrees> because you're not targeting the selects correctly.
[15:45:58] <Crystal> And the only thing changed between the two is one single thing
[15:46:09] <robertmaxrees> right - you're hiding the dynamically generated select.  one sec.
[15:46:17] <Crystal> Yes, thanks :)
[15:48:31] <robertmaxrees> https://api.jquerymobile.com/1.4/selectmenu/#method-option
[15:48:42] <robertmaxrees> scroll down to the option( optionName, value ) example.
[15:48:44] <robertmaxrees> that's what you want to use.
[15:48:47] <robertmaxrees> not .val()
[15:49:58] <robertmaxrees> alternatively, you use .val('whatever').refresh()
[15:50:17] <robertmaxrees> err, .val('whatever').selectmenu('refresh')
[15:52:16] <robertmaxrees> Crystal https://bpaste.net/show/TOXU like this.
[15:52:19] <robertmaxrees> sorry - out of it today :)
[15:59:51] <Crystal> #hero
[15:59:55] <Crystal> thank you very much
[16:00:05] <robertmaxrees> like I said, not CSS ;)
[16:00:09] <robertmaxrees> but you're welcome
[16:00:15] <Crystal> I see that now!
[16:35:00] <taplar> It's now crystal clear
[16:49:06] <Es0teric> i get this Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'preventDefault' of undefined  what could be the problem?
[16:49:16] <robertmaxrees> lmao
[16:49:22] <Es0teric> its not in a $(document).ready()
[16:49:23] <robertmaxrees> care to show us the code that's erroring?
[16:49:36] <taplar> <thisThingIsUndefined>.preventDefault()
[16:49:40] <robertmaxrees> ^
[16:49:51] <robertmaxrees> something tells me you didn't pass e or event to a handler.
[16:50:15] <robertmaxrees> brb
[16:51:05] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees https://kopy.io/0pn5c
[16:52:02] <robertmaxrees> what datepicker lib are you using?
[16:52:15] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees https://materializecss.com/pickers.html
[16:52:59] <robertmaxrees> just becuase it offers an onClose handler doesn't mean it passses anything to it.
[16:53:14] <Es0teric> so then how do i get preventDefault() to work then?
[16:53:29] <robertmaxrees> 2 things
[16:53:39] <robertmaxrees> 1. do console.log(event) right before your event.preventDefault() < what does this give you?  probably undfined.
[16:53:46] <robertmaxrees> 2. this isn't a jquery issue :)
[16:54:01] <Es0teric> correct
[16:54:05] <Es0teric> =_=
[16:55:48] <robertmaxrees> :)
[16:56:44] <Es0teric> great
[16:56:56] <Es0teric> so you dont want to help me now because its not a jquery issue?
[16:56:58] <robertmaxrees> Es0teric  you realize preventDefault() isnt a jquery thing, right?
[16:57:12] <robertmaxrees> it's O.T. for the channel my dude :)
