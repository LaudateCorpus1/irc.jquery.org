[10:30:15] <codecutter> 	its not static text where i can wrap it with a p tag as i type along. I'm pulling this data from the server
[10:43:23] <Nyle> Hello
[10:43:38] <Nyle> var chargebackamount = $('input[name=chargebackamount'+line_num+']').val().replace(/[^\d\.\-]/g, ''); in console, or in script, provides undefined
[10:43:52] <Nyle> but, $('input[name=chargebackamount'+line_num+']').val() produces the correct input value
[10:44:02] <Nyle> What am I missing to understand?

[12:33:59] <RahulAN> Hello all
[12:35:31] <RahulAN> I am trying to validate geocoding in JqueryValidation , but it always returns false.
[12:35:32] <RahulAN> https://gist.github.com/citrix123/edb7aee21e401e48f6207378913e07efhttps://gist.github.com/citrix123/edb7aee21e401e48f6207378913e07ef
[12:35:37] <RahulAN> This is my validation function.
[12:36:03] <RahulAN> At first it returns false and then returns true back
[12:37:14] <robertmaxrees> 404
[12:37:20] <robertmaxrees> but do a fiddle instead.
[12:39:12] <RahulAN> https://gist.github.com/citrix123/edb7aee21e401e48f6207378913e07ef
[12:39:18] <RahulAN> do this don't work ?
[12:39:29] <robertmaxrees> that works.  the other one didn't - looks like a bad paste the first time.
[12:39:43] <RahulAN> Ohh yes, Sorry for that :-)
[12:42:06] <robertmaxrees> soooo mind making a fiddle? :)
[12:42:24] <RahulAN> Hmm Ok !
[13:01:05] <RahulAN> robertmaxrees  I tried to create fiddle
[13:01:06] <RahulAN> https://jsfiddle.net/tn5kobq1/7/
[13:01:11] <RahulAN> But looks like some google map error
[13:04:37] <robertmaxrees> the url included a callback=
[13:04:45] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/n2Lfx3wm/ this working better?
[13:20:36] <robertmaxrees> also: why are you initializing in the callback?  that's going to fire a whole bunch.  init once before that handler and then call it from there.
[14:17:20] <audioburn> When creating dynamic html, is it better to clone an existing element or use $('</div>, {}) ?
[14:17:33] <robertmaxrees> depends.
[14:17:56] <robertmaxrees> i'd probably use a templating engine istead.
[14:18:00] <robertmaxrees> *instead
[15:07:19] <robertmaxrees> welp
[15:53:10] <royalty> what are your opinions on naming event evt or e in jquery functions
[15:53:19] <robertmaxrees> go with 'e'
[15:53:42] <royalty> haha, is that just more standard among the jquery community?
[15:53:43] <robertmaxrees> it's widely-known and accepted.
[15:53:46] <royalty> i see
[15:53:53] <robertmaxrees> frontend devs in general.
[15:53:58] <robertmaxrees> even in javascript land.
[15:54:19] <robertmaxrees> one of the few times a single letter name is perfectly fine.

[22:44:48] <alturic> Hello. Anyone familiar with Google Maps? I'm trying to dynamically change polygon opacity and while I can get it to work, I have to wrap the .fillOpacity, .fillColor and .setMap(map) calls in a setTimeout and I'm trying to figure out "why".
[22:45:26] <robertmaxrees> more likely to get help in ##javascript :)
[22:45:27] <alturic> While it's not working code in the context of actually seeing what it's doing, here is both the working and non-working variant of how I have to do it: https://jsfiddle.net/d0hqmraz/ - So yes, I have a setTimeout with a millisecond and it works, without that, it doesn't though...
