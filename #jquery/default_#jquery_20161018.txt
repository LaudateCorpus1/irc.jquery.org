[00:12:13] <hare> http://hastebin.com/raw/vekeduriva << the goal here is to change the background of an <img> element when the input element, both contained in a mw-ck-iconoption container, is selected. However, because this is too vague, it ends up changing the background of *all* the img options, not just the selected one.
[00:12:57] <nggs> what is the difference between the free version of eloquent javscript on the site and the paid book?
[00:14:31] <arc_> hare ok, so you need to use $(this) which in this context refers to the item that was hovered over, and traverse the tree to the element you want to change relative to $(this)
[00:15:01] <arc_> which i can't help you with unless i can see the html
[00:15:06] <hare> so, $( this ).parent.img or something?
[00:16:30] <arc_> if it's in a parent element, closest() is probably what i would use. closest() searches parent elements for elements matching a selector that you pass to closest()
[00:16:39] <hare> here is a representative example http://hastebin.com/raw/azilevixug
[00:16:44] <hare> of the html
[00:16:58] <hare> so, $( this ).closest( 'img' ) ?
[00:17:36] <arc_> well, what is being hovered
[00:17:56] <arc_> oh it's focus not hover. sorry
[00:18:28] <arc_> you can use siblings() here because img is a sibling
[00:19:14] <arc_> of the input
[00:19:52] <hare> $( this ).siblings( 'img' ) ?
[00:20:11] <arc_> yes
[00:21:32] <hare> so that works, but the issue I now have is that when I select a different input, the original one i selected keeps its background. i take it i need to instead do a focusin and focusout?
[00:21:56] <arc_> yes
[00:22:51] <arc_> actually hm. i guess firefox does not support focusin and focusout yet. so you need to use focus and blur
[00:23:21] <hare> blur being the canonical opposite of focus?
[00:23:29] <arc_> yes
[00:24:14] <hare> doesn't seem to work... http://hastebin.com/raw/niqurulese
[00:26:02] <arc_> idk, seems to work https://jsfiddle.net/qnnqymL7/
[00:27:10] <hare> what about for radio buttons?
[00:28:07] <arc_> still works
[00:30:20] <arc_> when you say it doesn't work, what do you mean
[00:30:23] <arc_> what is happening
[00:31:29] <hare> i select option a and the background changes accordingly; i then select option b and the background changes, but option a also keeps its background;
[00:33:29] <hare> what should happen is that only the selected item has a background; the others should not have a background
[00:33:38] <arc_> right
[00:33:45] <arc_> well, i just copied your code and it worked the way it's supposed to
[00:33:52] <arc_> so maybe there is a syntax error outside of the code you pasted
[00:33:56] <arc_> or something, idk
[00:34:12] <hare> i'll keep looking at it. in the meantime, focus/blur is what i want to use for indicating that a radio button is selected?
[00:34:47] <arc_> focus and blur are the events for when an element gains and loses focus. like when you are tabbing through elements on a page. that includes anchors and other stuff
[00:34:58] <arc_> but yes, it works for radio buttons
[00:35:01] <arc_> and other input elements
[00:36:51] <hare> obviously it sucks when something that works for you doesn't work for someone else, but i appreciate your help all the same
[00:46:39] <hare> arc_: here is the entire script if it helps. for context, this uses a framework called "oojs" which generates dialog windows and form widgets and things of that nature, but I don't think that's going to make a difference here. http://hastebin.com/opijevepoc.js
[01:15:02] <hare> arc_: figured it out by using a completely different strategy altogether. but thank you!
[01:35:09] <carpii> if i use jquery to .append() a valid HTML fragment, but in IE11's dom inspector, it shows something different, what could cause that? Basically the DOM is only adding the parent <div> and none of the child divs contained in the fragment
[01:35:20] <carpii> works fine in all other browsers
[01:36:15] <arc_> have you verified the html
[01:36:29] <arc_> ie is more stringent with syntax or other markup errors
[01:36:32] <m1st> hello, how to fix this script "$('#auto_load').load('index.jsp');"? it produces the following warning in chrome "Synchronous XMLHttpRequest on the main thread is deprecated because of its detrimental effects to the end user's experience." and do not work in  Internet Explorer
[01:37:46] <carpii> do you see the same problem when converting it to use $.get() ?
[01:39:10] <carpii> what is causing it to be synchronous anyway?
[01:39:43] <carpii> arc_, yes i wrapped an html container around it and verified it as valid with W3C
[01:40:08] <carpii> I also console.log the fragment in IE11 and its being generated properly
[01:40:34] <carpii> and then I manually set the parent divs contents to the same content, via IE console and it accepts it
[01:40:47] <carpii> but inserting the entire fragment in one go IE11 just adds container
[01:41:19] <arc_> sounds pretty weird, and like something for someone who knows more than me :)
[01:41:27] <carpii> me too :(
[01:41:34] <carpii> driving me crazy tho
[01:46:27] <m1st> carpii, the same problem with get
[01:46:29] <m1st> $.get( "index.jsp", function( data ) {
[01:46:29] <m1st>             $( "#auto_load" ).html( data );
[01:46:29] <m1st>         });
[01:47:34] <carpii> which jquery version and browser?
[01:48:12] <carpii> is there anything which could be setting async: false in your $.ajax calls?
[01:48:19] <carpii> or $.get, $.load etc
[01:48:30] <m1st> jquery.version = 3.1.0
[01:48:51] <m1st> chrome = 53
[01:49:15] <m1st> I am using it like this:     setTimeout(function () {
[01:49:15] <m1st>         $('#auto_load').load('index.jsp');
[01:49:15] <m1st>     }, 1000);
[01:49:31] <m1st> to refresh the div
[01:50:13] <carpii> you see the same problem when its not in a setTimeout?
[01:51:36] <m1st> yes
[01:51:52] <m1st> the problem within "$('#auto_load').load('index.jsp');"
[01:53:10] <carpii> dont know if this is related... the top nswer claims it was fixed in jquery 3.x
[01:53:11] <carpii> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/28322636/synchronous-xmlhttprequest-warning-and-script
[02:24:49] <m1st> can somebody help me?
[02:31:08] <Uhkis> m1st: use full path to the file
[02:32:41] <Uhkis> m1st: and search your code for async false, that's something you're not supposed to do
[02:37:10] <m1st> no any async false in my own code
[02:37:58] <m1st> with full path to the file I got: "jquery.js:9536 XMLHttpRequest cannot load file:///<path>index.jsp. Cross origin requests are only supported for protocol schemes: http, data, chrome, chrome-extension, https, chrome-extension-resource."
[02:39:02] <Uhkis> you're not supposed to use file://
[02:39:59] <m1st> I do not
[02:40:18] <m1st> my case: "jQuery('#auto_load').load('F:\\PROJECTS\\log-monitor\\src\\main\\webapp\\index.jsp');"
[02:41:04] <carpii> thats a file url
[02:41:23] <carpii> how does that even work for a jsp ?
[02:41:29] <Uhkis> it doesnt
[02:43:18] <carpii> heh
[02:43:34] <m1st> the same problem with html
[02:43:36] <m1st>         jQuery('#auto_load').load('index.html');
[02:44:13] <carpii> are you loading your page from disk?
[02:44:17] <Uhkis> 1) the sync problem comes from non-async ajax 2) protocol problem comes from file:// uris
[02:44:42] <m1st> carpii, yes
[02:44:59] <carpii> use a web server
[02:45:29] <carpii> even if its a local one

[03:59:32] <Lylie> quite new to this so apologies in advance
[04:00:40] <Cork> Lylie: i would strongly recommend not using event attributes

[06:09:34] <BulleTime> hey
[06:09:50] <BulleTime> anyone knows its possible to animate css scale with jquery?
[06:12:21] <sigdk> var request = $.ajax({ ...  request.success(function(data) {   ...   data is a JSON and data.devices is an array. Do I need to "decode" it somehow?  I get "undefined" when calling console.log(data.devices);
[06:32:48] <Uhkis> sigdk: where are you calling that?
[06:33:02] <mYDX> hello guys can anybody tell me how can i loop trough this array to remove double quotes from flugstunden? https://i.stack.imgur.com/bKG6w.png
[06:34:19] <mYDX> im trying to convert this value into number see few solutions with .map but dont realy now how it should be work
[06:36:51] <sigdk> Uhkis, hmm... in my js file
[06:37:23] <sigdk> Uhkis, I fetch a JSON from the backend containing an array... seems that I can dump the whole object but not only the array
[06:37:43] <Uhkis> sigdk: so not in your webserver config file, good!
[06:39:06] <sigdk> Uhkis, why would I have code in a config file?
[06:39:21] <sigdk> any idea what's wrong with my response object?
[06:39:53] <Uhkis> sigdk: i was kidding :) anyways that call should be in your success function, otherwise it will always be undefined
[06:40:16] <BulleTime> hi
[06:40:28] <BulleTime> looking for a way to make a 3d menu kinda like this:
[06:40:28] <BulleTime> https://desandro.github.io/3dtransforms/docs/carousel.html
[06:40:28] <sigdk> Uhkis, it is
[06:40:39] <BulleTime> but then vertical instead of horizontal..
[06:40:57] <Uhkis> sigdk: make a jsfiddle
[06:53:38] <sigdk> Uhkis, hard to mock backend but this should help: https://jsfiddle.net/dfwyfqm9/
[06:55:10] <Uhkis> sigdk: use http://doc.jsfiddle.net/use/echo.html#json or paste the json in the fiddle in some var
[06:57:12] <sigdk> Uhkis, thank you
[06:58:42] <momomo> what is the best approach to fire of a websocket.send request .. and then handle the response? how do you best tie a response to the orignal request?
[06:58:45] <momomo> any patterns?
[07:46:29] <shoky> sigdk: if your backend is not returning a proper json content-type header, then you need to tell jquery that it's json  with  dataType: 'json'
[07:46:58] <shoky> then you won't need to parse it yourself.  but it's best to have the backend return proper headers, then jquery auto detects it
[07:49:25] <shoky> sigdk: oh just saw your comment on top.. should be application/json..
[08:01:13] <Kadigan_KSB> Hey. I have a question: is it possible to replace an already loaded jQuery with a newer version w/o having to rewrite the code on top for noConflict?
[08:02:25] <Kadigan_KSB> The website I'm writing content for uses v1.6.1, and I'd like to use some new stuff that relies on 1.7 (like featherlight) and later. Unfortunately, as an editor, I don't have access to template editing, hence can't exclude the 1.6.1 from loading.
[08:06:46] <shoky> it's usually not a good idea to have more than one jquery included, especially if using any plugins,  things may and do go wrong quickly, unless only using really basic jquery stuff
[08:07:26] <Kadigan_KSB> Yeah, I figured -- hence the question. It would obviously need to be a hand-off or in-place upgrade, since everything previously defined would be lost at transition w/o it.
[08:17:19] <sigdk> shoky, I think the bug was at the backend... headers weren't set correctly
[08:17:21] <sigdk> thanks
[08:33:28] <hhee> guys,
[08:34:19] <hhee> need simple popup form. with feedback, any good tutorial for this?
[08:43:42] <Mikie> Hey, I am having a really weird issue. Everytime my handler for document ready is executes, it reloads the page
[08:43:44] <Mikie> https://gist.github.com/prejrdev/059cd903c5653f7250dc2f8fc3f9398d
[08:53:42] <Mikie> Ouch
[08:53:58] <Mikie> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement/click
[08:54:57] <Mikie> Not sure if this is an issue, but native DOM has a function on element objects called click that simulates a click
[08:55:38] <rndUser_> .
[09:45:06] <Firecatcher> hello, guys. can you help me with one thing? I want to get `this` of each elem in such construction: returnOptionsObject = function(){console.log(this)}; $(elem).editable(returnOptionsObject());
[09:46:13] <Firecatcher> need to pass `this` to function returnOptionsObjec?
[09:47:23] <Hanness_> hi I ma facing this bug: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4994 I am using jquery 1.12 also you can try it out here: http://jsfiddle.net/ActionJackson/aEzzx/1/
[09:47:46] <Hanness_> it does not work for me in the jsfiddle window but when I put it to simple html page I can reproduce. Any chance to fix that and how?
[09:58:06] <tikok> hello. Need help on event delegation. I'm using a mutation observer to watch when a new node is added to DOM. It works fine the first time but when I add a class to one of the childnode, it is detected as a new node. Hence same listener is suscribed multiple time to the same element. Any idea on how to avoid this drawback ?
[10:03:03] <shoky> that has nothing to do with event delegation or jquery. jquery doesn't do mutation observers
[10:11:09] <tikok> shoky, ok it is not event delegation but mutation observers is what I used to mirror the mechanism of event delegation
[10:28:44] <Bilz> Hi. I'm completely new to jQuery/ajax and just need it to perform a function. I'm essentially using ajax to call a php function after the click of a button (which I've done successfully using this post: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20738329/how-to-call-a-php-function-on-the-click-of-a-button (2nd answer, 42 votes)) and it works well. But actually I want to repeatedly call the php function when the button is down, rather than just
[10:28:44] <Bilz>  on click. Any suggestions on what to look at?
[10:31:55] <sigdk> Bilz, I'm not experienced either but this might help: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14445375/trigger-click-and-hold-event
[10:32:08] <sigdk> I guess you need to listen to a different kind of event
[10:33:39] <tikok> I'm using $(this) in a particular listener. How can look a close parent? When it's a child you can use find()/closest(). But how can I go up in the tree ?
[10:34:05] <Bilz> thanks sigdk . ill take a look. i also found something else that might be the solution on stackoverflow: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4961072/jquery-continuous-mousedown
[10:34:43] <tikok> There is the possibility of calling .parent() multitple times but I don't think it is the best way to do it.
[10:44:12] <Alturic> Hey guys, can anyone point me in the right direction to convert entities? I'm trying to set a var zipcode = data['zipcode_name'] and ' is being displayed as entities, &#039; I have it converting the entities by doing $('<div/>').html(data['zipcode_name']).text(); but that just seems odd using a "fake" <div> element?
[10:54:49] <MikeD_> Alturic: in all the craziness that people implement, that one isn't too offensive
[11:56:54] <BulleTime> hi
[11:57:04] <BulleTime> busy split shit
[11:57:09] <BulleTime> anyone around?
[11:57:15] <BulleTime> simple question:
[11:57:16] <BulleTime> http://codepen.io/BulleTTime/pen/WGarwQ
[11:57:16] <robertmaxrees> about 540 people
[11:57:27] <BulleTime> how to hide the text with css?
[11:57:43] <robertmaxrees> lol
[11:57:58] <robertmaxrees> you can't.
[11:58:39] <robertmaxrees> well, sort of.  whgat exactly are you trying to accomplish?
[11:58:45] <robertmaxrees> does the text need to just not be visible?
[12:02:25] <robertmaxrees> #welp
[12:09:25] <BulleTime> robertmaxrees yes
[12:09:54] <BulleTime> its html from a wordpress plugin printed by php so i cant edit the plugin
[12:09:55] <BulleTime> but
[12:10:11] <BulleTime> yes i want to remove the text, not the flag (image)
[12:14:08] <robertmaxrees> yeah that's kind of a pain.  use .contents() to find that text node and kill it.
[12:14:24] <robertmaxrees> or find the specific elements you care about and overwrite the original.
[12:14:30] <altab> hi, is there a way to detect if the geolocalisation preference for a website on a browser is set on "On demand" or "Always" in jQuery?
[12:15:25] <shoky> in jquery? no.  in js?  maybe, though i doubt it
[12:33:56] <httperr418> is it possible to set a timeout and error fallback within a .load()?
[12:36:27] <robertmaxrees> sure.  .load() iirc exposes a promise.
[12:36:53] <robertmaxrees> oh maybe not.
[12:37:21] <httperr418> oh well, I guess I'll have to find another way
[12:37:23] <robertmaxrees> i'd just use .ajax() at that point.
[12:37:30] <httperr418> k thanks :)
[12:37:35] <robertmaxrees> since that's all .load() is actually doing anyway.
[12:37:55] <httperr418> home time now, will have to work on it tomorrow
[12:38:00] <robertmaxrees> 'kay
[12:39:17] <gambl0re> hi robert
[12:40:57] <robertmaxrees> good morning
[12:41:35] <TWG_> robertmaxrees: I wish it was still morning here.  Need about 4 more hours in my work day.
[12:41:48] <robertmaxrees> heh.
[12:41:57] <robertmaxrees> i need about one more in in each of my days lately.
[12:42:40] <TWG_> I know the feeling.  People just seem to walk into my office for a quick fix on something and then end up in a tangent for at least an hour.  Kills the mojo for the day.
[12:42:41] <robertmaxrees> *one more day, that is.
[12:43:06] <robertmaxrees> for me it's all my personal life stuff that's a problem.
[12:44:47] <TWG_> That always sucks.
[12:45:48] <gambl0re> im getting 'extend' is undefiend
[12:45:54] <gambl0re> what does that mean... var HelloWorld = Marionette.LayoutView.extend({  //
[12:46:14] <robertmaxrees> that means there's no extend method available on LayoutView
[12:46:20] <robertmaxrees> exactly what it says.
[12:47:18] <gambl0re> i followed steps 2.1 - 2.4 exact https://marionette.gitbooks.io/marionette-guides/content/en/getting_started/tutorial/firstview.html
[12:47:26] <robertmaxrees> okay/
[12:47:32] <robertmaxrees> this isn't a marionette channel.
[12:47:52] <robertmaxrees> but a quick idea would be to make sure you're actually loading marionette in the first place.
[12:48:07] <robertmaxrees> check your network panel and make sure you aren't getting 404s.
[12:48:53] <gambl0re> bundle.js is being loaded
[12:49:03] <gambl0re> do you have experience with webpack? its a little advanced topic
[12:49:15] <robertmaxrees> lol
[12:49:22] <gambl0re> what?
[12:49:22] <robertmaxrees> i have some, but again - you're in the wrong channel.
[12:49:32] <gambl0re> ok no problem..
[13:10:48] <physikoi> Hi #jquery, is there such thing as an event listener for removal?
[13:11:47] <physikoi> I ask because I'm trying to attach an event to an element that already has a click event handler, which removes said element.
[13:13:41] <robertmaxrees> whyfor?
[13:13:51] <robertmaxrees> like - why do you want a listener for when an element was removed?
[13:28:03] <physikoi> robertmaxrees: sorry, didn't get a bell notice.
[13:28:36] <physikoi> I'm trying to exit fullscreen and I'd like the same element that removes stuff to also exit fullscreen
[13:29:58] <robertmaxrees> why not edit the event handler for removal?
[13:30:07] <robertmaxrees> alternatively, add another event handler.
[13:30:13] <Hannes__> is there a options like for header ui-bt-right for buttons not in header? I just want to align one button on the right side
[13:30:21] <physikoi> robertmaxrees: said event handler is part of a plugin
[13:31:10] <robertmaxrees> which plugin?
[13:32:22] <physikoi> robertmaxrees: rejas/imagelightbox
[13:32:30] <physikoi> On github.
[13:32:55] <robertmaxrees> onEnd
[13:33:01] <robertmaxrees> has a callback for that.
[13:33:01] <physikoi> robertmaxrees: my click seems to go "unheard"
[13:33:40] <robertmaxrees> physikoi right - it has a callback for exactly what you want.
[13:33:56] <robertmaxrees> give a callback to the onEnd option
[14:12:24] <robertmaxrees> welp

[14:44:46] <developer818> ok @robertmaxrees
[14:45:23] <robertmaxrees> also: two other things - should be $(document) with no quotes, and why not use jquery's .on() for event binding
[14:46:18] <robertmaxrees> also: that for loop isn't doing anything for you here.
[14:48:07] <developer818> ok I’ve updated the link @robertmaxrees

[14:49:02] <robertmaxrees> Alturic you could look into decodeURIcomponent
[14:49:24] <robertmaxrees> developer818 erm...
[14:49:29] <robertmaxrees> i don't need all of that.  one sec.
[14:50:03] <developer818> ok
[14:50:22] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/bh526L9a/3/
[14:50:25] <robertmaxrees> here.
[14:50:33] <robertmaxrees> but fwiw - that for loop is totally unnecessary.
[14:50:35] <shoky> Alturic: you could use .html() on the actual element you're adding that text to and it should work.. but the real issue here is having htmlentities in your (non-html) data to begin with
[14:51:15] <shoky> (using .html() is not secure if the data is user-provided)
[14:51:18] <taplar> robertmaxrees: three jquery includes, a record!
[14:51:22] <robertmaxrees> i know!
[14:51:39] <robertmaxrees> developer818 https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/bh526L9a/5/ you were also including jquery three separate times :)
[14:51:43] <robertmaxrees> but this works.
[14:52:29] <developer818> Ok
[14:52:48] <Alturic> shoky, What if I'm not really adding it to any element, in the case of console.log, unless that's considered an element in it's own.
[14:53:12] <shoky> Alturic: console.log doesn't know html, so it will print the characters as-is, which is expected
[14:53:28] <shoky> those characters are in your string, so they're logged ;p
[14:53:33] <developer818> @robertmaxrees So the problem is its not outputting the correct multiples
[14:53:57] <taplar> index vs offset issue, :)
[14:54:05] <robertmaxrees> ^^^
[14:54:09] <robertmaxrees> arrays are 0-index.
[14:54:54] <developer818> right
[14:55:11] <robertmaxrees> so then use a var that's index + 1 for your conditionals instead.
[14:55:24] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/bh526L9a/7/
[14:56:39] <developer818> hmmm I see
[14:56:40] <taplar> what is a 'fizzbuzz' challenge?
[14:57:11] <robertmaxrees> for every multiple of 3, print fizz.  for every muiltiple of 5, print buzz.  for every mulktiple of both, print fizzbuzz
[14:57:24] <taplar> this is a 'thing' ?
[14:57:28] <robertmaxrees> very much so.
[14:57:30] <shoky> yep
[14:57:32] <taplar> hmm
[14:57:37] <robertmaxrees> entire sites dedicated to various solutions for it.
[14:57:59] <developer818> Thank you robertmaxrees
[14:58:13] <developer818> I’ll keep this in mind
[14:58:36] <robertmaxrees> did you see why the for was totally unnecessary?
[15:00:03] <taplar> you could get rid of the first if if you did appends
[15:00:15] <taplar> fwict
[15:00:47] <robertmaxrees> ^
[15:01:12] <ldlework> If I have a bunch of modifications to do, say I'm doing them in an .each(), is there a way I can do each modification "asynchronously"?
[15:01:20] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[15:01:26] <robertmaxrees> gotta wait on the dom.
[15:01:27] <ldlework> That is, not lock up the browser while all the modifications are taking place?
[15:01:35] <robertmaxrees> ah.
[15:01:37] <ldlework> That's what I mean, can I schedule the work?
[15:01:40] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[15:01:45] <ldlework> that's surprising
[15:01:56] <robertmaxrees> not really - that's the DOM.  however, you can speed it up easily.
[15:02:09] <robertmaxrees> there a parent element for all the ones you're working on?
[15:02:12] <developer818> Yes, originally I didnt have a for, but as I was looking online I started seeing for’s so I implemented it
[15:02:37] <robertmaxrees> developer818 fwiw you weren't using the for at all.  it was just extra work for no reason ;)
[15:02:49] <developer818> Gotcha
[15:03:44] <robertmaxrees> ldlework the idea is you do something like var $theParent = $('.someParentElement').detach();, then you do all work work against that object, then .append() it back where it was.
[15:03:59] <ldlework> robertmaxrees: and that avoids the overhead?
[15:04:06] <robertmaxrees> that way you have a single insertion and the browser only has to do its redraw/repaint for every change.
[15:04:12] <robertmaxrees> there's just a single, big change instead.
[15:04:23] <robertmaxrees> or you can .clone() it and .replace() instead.
[15:04:39] <ldlework> I guess I can try that...

[15:14:17] <al_nz1> morning all
[15:15:14] <robertmaxrees> good morning.
[15:15:42] <al_nz1> hiya Robdgreat
[15:15:46] <robertmaxrees> lol
[15:15:48] <al_nz1> hiya robertmaxrees
[15:16:08] <al_nz1> did you say the other day ur in nocal?
[15:16:23] <robertmaxrees> probably.
[15:18:31] <robertmaxrees> why do you ask?
[15:19:58] <al_nz1> robertmaxrees: well if nocal stands for North California I was in California recently
[15:20:02] <al_nz1> had a great time there
[15:20:17] <robertmaxrees> where in california?
[15:20:25] <robertmaxrees> 'cause it's like 3 diufferent states.
[15:20:28] <al_nz1> didnt probably get to North California, but I dont really know what you call N california? (SF?)
[15:20:34] <al_nz1> Mainly LA and SD
[15:20:39] <robertmaxrees> yeah that was socal.
[15:20:52] <robertmaxrees> sf calls itself norcal but that's about 4 or 5 hours south of where i am.
[15:21:04] <al_nz1> I had thought about PCH to SF, but the kids wouldnt have enjoyed that :(
[15:21:06] <al_nz1> next time
[15:21:19] <al_nz1> we got may grey
[15:22:35] <robertmaxrees> "may grey"?
[15:23:02] <al_nz1> may grey? or whatever they call it
[15:23:03] <al_nz1> grey days
[15:23:14] <AwkwardCough> jean grey's less cool sister
[15:23:20] <robertmaxrees> we just call that "weather" lol
[15:28:42] <al_nz1> robertmaxrees: r u a front end guy or full stack?
[15:29:02] <robertmaxrees> neither?
[15:29:14] <robertmaxrees> i'm mostly frontend but i work quite extensively in our node codebase.
[15:31:57] <al_nz1> right
[15:32:09] <al_nz1> so much to learn
[15:40:11] <al_nz1> one other bit of weirdness going on my form, since i added the "add stat" button which involved changing the id in the decendant of panel-body from id=container to id=statscontainer now the date pickers dont work (I also hide the row initally)
[15:40:18] <al_nz1> http://ec2-54-252-139-87.ap-southeast-2.compute.amazonaws.com/
[15:43:18] <robertmaxrees> lol
[15:44:16] <patrickk> ??
[15:46:57] <patrickk> al_nz1: they have the same "id"
[15:47:24] <patrickk> you have to increment them as well
[15:51:00] <al_nz1> one has id clearancedate0 one has id apprehension date0?
[15:52:14] <patrickk> check clearance date ids of them
[15:52:18] <patrickk> both have clearance0
[15:57:12] <al_nz1> patrickk: where are you seeing them both having clearance0?
[15:58:24] <patrickk> al_nz1: which browser are you using
[15:58:45] <patrickk> I just refreshed your page and there is another set of errors there now
[15:59:04] <al_nz1> i am in chrome atm
[15:59:05] <patrickk> both related to Google Maps
[15:59:16] <al_nz1> yeah, I am not worried about that one atm
[15:59:38] <patrickk> al_nz1: after the page has loaded, right click and click on inspect element, and then open the "Console" tab, that should show you the errors
[15:59:51] <patrickk> right click within the page on an empty space
[16:01:01] <al_nz1> yes I see the maps errors,
[16:01:08] <al_nz1> but I dnt see any nonmaps errors
[16:02:25] <al_nz1> maybe a breakpoint in the script for the datepicker would shed somelight
[16:04:08] <al_nz1> ok, so it never hits the javascript
[16:26:23] <al_nz1> so if one has multiple fields, like birth1, birth2, birth3 - is there a way to have one peice of code that will fire for any of them?
[16:26:54] <patrickk> al_nz1: use a class on them as well, and then fire the js on that class instead of the ID
[16:27:05] <patrickk> classes can be same, IDs cannot be same
[16:27:18] <al_nz1> patrickk: right, then use this?
[16:31:43] <robertmaxrees> al_nz1 you'd do well to run through something like a tutorial to familiarize yourself with some jquery basics.
[16:33:16] <al_nz1> ok.
[16:33:22] <al_nz1> fair call
[16:33:52] <robertmaxrees> you've been asking a lot of the same questions and having a lot of the same issues.
[16:33:57] <robertmaxrees> which is why i say that.
[16:34:29] <al_nz1> true. but also to be fair, that I have got as far as I have with a somewhat complicated form is amazing
[16:34:55] <robertmaxrees> heh, i'm not denying your achievement, but it'd sure be easier for you if you had the basics down :)
[16:35:29] <patrickk> al_nz1: try to fix the error one by one
[16:35:34] <patrickk> errors* even
[16:35:57] <robertmaxrees> also being able to break the problem down into its component parts and making test cases is a great skill.
[16:36:38] <al_nz1> yes, and thats where knowing the debug tools is invaluable
[16:36:48] <al_nz1> because you can find your own answers :)
[16:36:53] <robertmaxrees> errr, sort of.
[16:37:00] <robertmaxrees> related but different skillset.
[17:17:40] <al_nz1> is there a way in a statement like : var $newPerson = $('#person_template').clone(true).prop("input", "dob"+num); to see what prop is matching in the console or similar?
[17:18:05] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[17:18:40] <al_nz1> $newPerson is a block of html. I want to see which input prop is matching
[17:18:44] <al_nz1> it should be the first one
[17:18:49] <robertmaxrees> .prop() will look at the clone of #person_template.
[17:18:52] <robertmaxrees> which would be invalid.
[17:19:01] <robertmaxrees> and you'll need find the input first.
[17:19:08] <robertmaxrees> and then you'd do .filter()
[17:19:25] <robertmaxrees> though there's no "input" property.
[17:20:13] <al_nz1> why would clone of person template be invalid?
[17:20:21] <robertmaxrees> duplicate IDs.
[17:21:05] <al_nz1> robertmaxrees: no - I have a few lines of code to get the next number for a new index.
[17:21:17] <al_nz1> ie next row
[17:21:20] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[17:21:36] <robertmaxrees> $('#person_template').clone(true) will cause you to have two delements in the dom with the same ID.
[17:22:11] <al_nz1> http://pastebin.com/yamYJkjZ
[17:22:39] <robertmaxrees> $('#person_template').clone(true)
[17:23:30] <robertmaxrees> you can't do that.  it might "work" but it's technicalyl invalid.  and .prop("input", "dob"+num); sets the property "input" to whatever you pass as the second arg.
[17:23:41] <robertmaxrees> you need to find('input').filter(function() {});
[17:23:45] <robertmaxrees> and check in that function.
[17:27:20] <al_nz1> right so its more like prop('id', 'dob'+num)
[17:27:29] <robertmaxrees> ....
[17:27:30] <robertmaxrees> no.
[17:27:33] <robertmaxrees> not at all like that.
[17:27:50] <al_nz1> that would set the first id=dob3
[17:27:50] <robertmaxrees> .prop('id', 'dob' + num) will set the ID of that element.
[17:28:04] <robertmaxrees> and it would set the target element to that.
[17:28:16] <al_nz1> isnt that what I wrote?
[17:28:40] <robertmaxrees> before you said you were looking for the first input in that element.
[17:28:42] <robertmaxrees> is that not the case>?
[17:29:36] <al_nz1> what I just wrote set the first id in my clone to id=dob3
[17:30:04] <robertmaxrees> you're still going to have an instance where the initial element will have the same ID.
[17:30:05] <robertmaxrees> but okay.
[17:30:06] <robertmaxrees> :)
[17:30:08] <al_nz1> Now I will work on using filter to set the id inside the correct input
[17:30:32] <robertmaxrees> fwiw if you're going to set the ID on that parent then you don't really need one on the input.
[17:42:39] <al_nz1> will I have a duplicate ID at the end of doc ready? My understanding is the formloads with person0 and person 1 present and shown. Person2 is present and hidden until addPerson() runs, at which point person2 is cloned and the cloned person incremented, person2 is unhidden, then the cloned & incremented person is appened (but still hidden)
[17:42:51] <al_nz1> If i understand that logic correctly there is no dups?
[17:42:55] <al_nz1> (brb)
[17:43:06] <robertmaxrees> ...
[17:43:08] <robertmaxrees> lol
[17:43:33] <robertmaxrees> by virtue of having clones the element with an id, you have a duplicate.
[17:43:40] <robertmaxrees> (shrug) i don't know how else to phrase that.
[18:02:42] <al_nz1> robertmaxrees: but the clone adds +num
[18:05:30] <al_nz1> hmmm, i see what u mean
[18:30:32] <al_nz1> why does var newPerson = $('#person_template').prop('id', 'dob' + num) change the original and the clone?
[18:30:52] <shoky> al_nz1: that's not a clone
[18:31:13] <al_nz1> yeah sorry, var newPerson = $('#person_template').clone(true).prop('id', 'dob' + num)
[18:33:14] <shoky> al_nz1: mm that doesn't change the original
[18:35:16] <shoky> but don't use such id's anyway, don't put numbers in your ids
[18:35:36] <al_nz1> so http://pastebin.com/SsCjT5gj
[18:35:38] <shoky> use a class + data-attrs instead
[18:35:59] <shoky> you're setting the prop on the original, not the clone
[18:36:00] <al_nz1> should add unique id's
[18:36:03] <shoky> you're not doing anything with the clone
[18:36:10] <shoky> no, don't use id's for this
[18:36:41] <al_nz1> shoky: ok I get dont use id's for this purpose....but just in terms of the code I posted
[18:36:52] <shoky> yes, see what i just said
[18:37:15] <shoky> that's not the same as  <al_nz1> yeah sorry, var newPerson = $('#person_template').clone(true).prop('id', 'dob' + num)
[18:37:32] <al_nz1> I tried both
[18:37:40] <shoky> var newPerson = $('#person_template').clone(true).prop('id', 'dob' + num)
[18:37:42] <shoky> ^ that works.
[18:38:14] <shoky> if you do  newPerson = $('#person_template')   then newPerson will be the original, not the clone
[18:39:12] <al_nz1> ok
[18:53:14] <JonelethIrenicus> I am removing a class and it is a .button() but after removing the class the same button function is executed even after removing the class.  What is the proper way to remove the class and disable the button to have it execute a different button?
[19:37:46] <al_nz1> can anyone see why the DOB picker on the second tab after you have added a person doesnt work? http://ec2-54-252-139-87.ap-southeast-2.compute.amazonaws.com/
[20:17:16] <shoky> al_nz1 works for me
[20:37:34] <al_nz1> shoky: ya - I fixed it :-)

[23:53:05] <ancestral> I really do not want to write something from scratch, and I am wary of tutorials that do the same. I just want something that’s done and that works
[23:53:26] <kmodo> ancestral before the user uploads?
[23:53:36] <ancestral> No, after
[23:53:49] <ancestral> Presume it’s been loaded and I know where the image is located
[23:54:14] <kmodo> well with javascript it'd be weird to do it that way, you'd have to load it and then save it again
[23:56:02] <ancestral> kmodo: I’m running PHP, I have people upload or link to images, so that’s not an issue.
[23:56:27] <kmodo> right well my reason for asking was whether you'd want to process the image on the server, or on the user's pc
[23:56:41] <kmodo> via javascript or via php (imagemagik)
[23:56:53] <ancestral> Technically I don’t need to process it, just need the X Y width and height the user wants
[23:57:04] <ancestral> I’m already resizing it with PHP
[23:57:08] <kmodo> ahh and pass that to php?
[23:57:09] <kmodo> cool
[23:57:12] <kmodo> let me find the one i used to use
[23:58:01] <kmodo> https://fengyuanchen.github.io/cropperjs/
[23:58:04] <kmodo> seems powerful enough
[23:59:19] <ancestral> I think I’ve seen this before, but didn’t integrate it
[23:59:24] <ancestral> I’ll give it a shot, thanks
