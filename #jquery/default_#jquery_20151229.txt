[00:00:29] <Greener> I want to use jquery in a userscript. Is there any reason I shouldn't paste the whole thing in? It looks very small when minified. If I instead have the script get it from googleapis.com, will users' browsers have to download it every time?
[01:32:42] <wa5ted> yo
[02:12:07] <DrRush> What kind of console error would jquery throw at me if I tried to use a function that no longer exists?
[02:14:41] <c0ma> function not defined?
[02:14:54] <c0ma> probably
[02:15:02] <c0ma> function_name is not defined
[02:15:04] <c0ma> or something like that

[05:49:30] <sasha> Hey guys, I'm trying to do $("label[for=three] # title span").text(title);
[05:49:59] <sasha> when I do it without the #title part, the text gets replaced, however it replaces the text in all of the spans
[05:50:51] <sasha> (there isn't a space between # and title -> it's #title but I didn't copy it)
[05:50:56] <sasha> any ideas where I'm going wrong?
[05:54:35] <Xatenev> sasha: what is not working now?, that replaces all spans inside an element wit hthe id title

[05:55:58] <Xatenev> ah
[05:56:03] <Xatenev> for='three'

[06:30:04] <rahj> Hii all
[06:30:11] <rahj> I am trying to validate my form
[06:30:44] <rahj> I want that if the certain dropdown is selected don't validate Email
[06:30:49] <rahj> How can i do this?
[06:32:29] <hellyeah> if you can do jsfiddle
[06:32:36] <hellyeah> people can answer you faster
[06:32:48] <rahj> Yes i am trying that
[06:32:57] <rahj> but i am not getting desired output there..
[06:33:14] <rahj> hellyeah, https://jsfiddle.net/x783xL1t/
[06:33:57] <rahj> this is my fiddle but how to include the bootstrap file?
[06:34:27] <hellyeah> external file did you see that part?
[06:35:07] <hellyeah> i am sure someone will answer you
[06:35:50] <hellyeah> Cork: he is not here nowadays
[06:35:52] <hellyeah> interesting
[06:36:42] <rahj> hellyeah, Sorry i didn't understood what you mean
[06:37:12] <hellyeah> there is externel resources
[06:37:21] <hellyeah> you can add bootstrap files there
[06:37:27] <rahj> bootstrap.js, formValidation.js, jquery.min.js, bootstrap.min.js, bootstrap.css
[06:37:31] <rahj> these are my files
[06:37:55] <hellyeah> okey click external resouces
[06:38:00] <hellyeah> you will see input box
[06:38:03] <rahj> Yes i clicked
[06:38:07] <rahj> yes,\
[06:38:08] <hellyeah> copy and paste address then click +
[06:38:17] <hellyeah> it will add file
[06:38:37] <rahj> I don;t have address of this one, they are on my machine
[06:39:43] <hellyeah> well
[06:39:54] <hellyeah> you should find the url for that files
[06:39:56] <hellyeah> or
[06:40:03] <hellyeah> hmm
[06:40:14] <hellyeah> you see javascript panel right
[06:40:28] <hellyeah> i assum e formvalidation.js is your own script
[06:41:03] <rahj> Yes
[06:41:09] <rahj> i had downloaded it
[06:42:01] <hellyeah> you can copy and paste to js panel
[06:42:16] <hellyeah> bootstrap.js you can add from external resources
[06:42:22] <hellyeah> basically you have two option
[06:50:30] <rahj> That is so hard to do
[06:50:42] <rahj> but i guess this is also pretty self explainatry
[06:56:20] <Uhkis> rahj: you can just use jquery 2.1.0 from the js menu and click to enable bootstrap
[07:21:03] <rahj> Uhkis, I did it
[07:21:14] <rahj> but stil the validations are not working
[07:34:57] <hellyeah> hey anyone around?
[07:35:43] <hellyeah> when you drop button onto another button div is created but there is space in left side. Is there any mistake i did or is it normal behaivour http://jsfiddle.net/j2eco7u9/70/
[08:25:23] <ifohancroft> Hello, everyone. Can you recommend me a method of validating if a form field's value is either a valid IP address or a valid domain name? Possibly without regex?
[09:42:24] <ExtraSteve> Is there any reason to use click() vs a delegator function/on()?
[09:42:40] <ExtraSteve> I mean, I know that delegators are nice for when elements are added or removed from the DOM
[09:42:55] <ExtraSteve> But is there a reason to use that kind of setup when things AREN'T being added/removed from the DOM?
[09:43:02] <taplar> if there's only a single element that is predefined, on('click') is fine
[09:43:41] <ExtraSteve> hm
[09:44:04] <taplar> or in the case that you have some bubbling that you want to prevent
[09:44:10] <taplar> a delegate wouldn't help you there
[09:45:05] <ExtraSteve> makes sense
[09:45:14] <Uhkis> i can't think of any reason to use click() instead of on() ;)
[09:46:12] <taplar> i could play devils advocate, >:)
[09:47:53] <matyus> ExtraSteve you want to use el.on('click', '.button', fn(){}) when there's a large number of .button elements that you're binding to
[09:48:42] <ExtraSteve> matyus: but is there any reeason not to use it if you just have one button?
[09:48:52] <taplar> nah
[09:49:07] <ExtraSteve> fair enough
[09:49:12] <taplar> unless the bubbling thing as previous
[09:49:42] <ExtraSteve> Right
[09:50:53] <taplar> just make sure to bind as low as possi ble
[09:52:53] <ExtraSteve> Thanks :)
[09:59:07] <jeffreylevesque> what kind of tool do you guys use to  mockup designs?
[09:59:08] <multi_io> the jQuery.ajax() "global" parameter should support a 3rd option in addition to true als false, which would trigger the global handlers only if the caller didn't provide an error function.
[09:59:12] <multi_io> right?
[09:59:17] <multi_io> or am I missing something?
[09:59:26] <taplar> jeffreylevesque:ux design?
[09:59:38] <Xatenev> jeffreylevesque: paint
[09:59:41] <Xatenev> jeffreylevesque: kappa
[09:59:50] <jeffreylevesque> is photoshop still a standard for designing?
[09:59:58] <Xatenev> yes
[10:00:16] <Xatenev> jeffreylevesque: together with stuff like adobie illustrator
[10:00:19] <Xatenev> adobe*
[10:00:22] <taplar> jeffreylevesque: https://balsamiq.com/
[10:00:25] <multi_io> jeffreylevesque: Gliffy
[10:00:49] <multi_io> (there's also a confluence wiki plugin for that, if you/your organisation uses that)
[10:02:23] <jeffreylevesque> is there something like https://www.gliffy.com/ but open source that you guys use?
[10:03:09] <ifohancroft> Is anyone here familiar with the 'jQuery Validation Plugin' I have a question to which I couldn't find the answer on the plugin's website? Is it possible to give rules to a form field so the field is validated against one of those not all?
[10:03:20] <multi_io> it's probably not ideal for pixel-precise layouting, only for hammering out the general UI flow, e.g. which pages you wanna have
[10:03:31] <ifohancroft> I mean I want to validate that my field has either a valid ip or a valid domain name (or url) inside but not both
[10:04:18] <taplar> ifohancroft:that would be some sort of regex i would assume
[10:04:58] <ifohancroft> well i am already using this plugin for form validation and i don't think i can (easily) make it use another method of validation if one of its validation methods fails
[10:05:24] <taplar> rules can take functions that do their validation.  they just need to return true or false
[10:05:44] <taplar> your using this guy right? http://jqueryvalidation.org/
[10:05:56] <ifohancroft> yes
[10:05:59] <taplar> yep
[10:06:04] <ifohancroft> and i have added a method that validates ip
[10:06:07] <ifohancroft> it is working
[10:06:09] <ifohancroft> my problem is
[10:06:22] <ifohancroft> how do i make it, if the value in the field is not ip
[10:06:27] <ifohancroft> how to make it check if it's a domain/url
[10:06:38] <taplar> test if it is an ip.  if false, test if it is a domain/url
[10:06:52] <ifohancroft> well that is what i tried doing
[10:07:01] <ifohancroft> i've put the code for url validation in the
[10:07:07] <taplar> got a fiddle.  what have you tried?
[10:07:21] <ifohancroft> yeah let me make one
[10:08:47] <ifohancroft> May I try to just explain here? It will require quite the editting to make a good fiddle that akes sense outside of the website i am working on
[10:09:11] <taplar> i'm just interested in your validation rule setup
[10:09:20] <ifohancroft> ok, well, here it is sort of:
[10:09:40] <ifohancroft> rules: {
[10:09:40] <ifohancroft>                 query: {
[10:09:40] <ifohancroft>                     required: true,
[10:09:40] <ifohancroft>                     ipvalidation: true
[10:09:40] <ifohancroft>                 }
[10:09:40] <ifohancroft>             }
[10:09:49] <ifohancroft> this is for the ip address validation
[10:10:01] <taplar> please don't paste code in the room.  make a fiddle pls
[10:10:29] <ifohancroft> oh sry, sure i will
[10:11:27] <taplar> and take a look at this guy
[10:11:28] <taplar> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/241145/jquery-validate-plugin-how-to-create-a-simple-custom-rule
[10:11:32] <ifohancroft> https://jsfiddle.net/dnLynq1d/
[10:13:05] <ExtraSteve> Yeah, I think you need a custom rule - one that'll check for ip then for domain
[10:13:13] <ExtraSteve> I don't think you can do it with their simple config
[10:13:20] <taplar> following that SO link pattern you may can add a method like IpOrUrl and inside that function call the two other methods for the valiation
[10:13:35] <ifohancroft> to be honest I have no idea how to do that.
[10:13:41] <ifohancroft> i am very new to this plugin
[10:14:09] <ExtraSteve> ifohancroft: check out the link that taplar posted
[10:14:51] <matyus> ExtraSteve: sorry, delayed response. I guess it's not going to hurt anything if you use delegation for one element. but you wouldn't use delegation (like the exmaple I showed) for one .button because what you have to do is actually bind to the parent element
[10:15:49] <ifohancroft> In general this helps, but in my particular case it raises a thousand questions
[10:16:08] <taplar> cool, :)  means you get to learn new things
[10:16:45] <ifohancroft> For example here is what the method I am using for ip validation uses: return /^[\d.]+$/.test(value); should I not return the result and save it in a variable and do the same but with a different regex for domain and check if either of those variables is true then just return true or false depends on the result?
[10:17:18] <taplar> up to you.  it could possibly be done in a single regex
[10:17:26] <taplar> might be more readable to separate them though
[10:17:44] <ifohancroft> would you be able to recommend me a good regex for a domain?
[10:17:53] <hellyeah> hey
[10:18:02] <taplar> not personally
[10:18:14] <ifohancroft> if i am doing it custom i might as well test for a domain instead of settling up for a url test :D
[10:19:08] <hellyeah> let us think about we create two divs by ddropping a into b and c into d. I want to add a into div that contains c and d how can i do that? Any tips http://jsfiddle.net/j2eco7u9/70/
[10:19:31] <hellyeah> ifohancroft: there is ##regex channel or with one # i am not sure
[10:20:21] <hellyeah> also http://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/8-regular-expressions-you-should-know--net-6149 , http://stackoverflow.com/questions/161738/what-is-the-best-regular-expression-to-check-if-a-string-is-a-valid-url , http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2490310/regular-expression-for-checking-website-url
[10:20:47] <ExtraSteve> ifohancroft: are you trying to validate that a domain EXISTS? Or just that it is a domain?
[10:21:02] <ExtraSteve> Those are two very different things
[10:21:15] <hellyeah> my question is understandable?
[10:27:06] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/xyqh2j84/ just playing around with the idea
[10:30:09] <taplar> hellyeah:why can you not drop into the existing ul?
[10:32:24] <hellyeah> hmm
[10:33:05] <hellyeah> sometimes i can drop sometimes not
[10:33:08] <hellyeah> i dont understand
[10:33:33] <taplar> how do you drop something into something else?
[10:33:59] <hellyeah> like
[10:34:12] <hellyeah> i click the button hold it and drag and drop onto another area
[10:34:21] <taplar> is that happening?
[10:34:30] <hellyeah> sometimes
[10:34:36] <hellyeah> but not everytime
[10:34:38] <taplar> so what should you verify?
[10:34:40] <hellyeah> i dont understand that
[10:35:10] <hellyeah> hmm when i drag and drop into anothear area i should check it works or not
[10:35:30] <taplar> your assuming you ARE dropping into another area
[10:35:42] <hellyeah> yes
[10:35:46] <taplar> are you?
[10:36:01] <hellyeah> by dropping button onto another button in different area
[10:36:05] <taplar> are you?
[10:36:12] <Tomatosoup1> hello, https://jsfiddle.net/Tomatosoup/k8v2b01s/13/ could any one tell me what is wrong with that code ?
[10:36:15] <hellyeah> yes
[10:36:21] <taplar> if you were it would be working
[10:36:27] <taplar> verify your assumptions
[10:36:31] <hellyeah> it would work
[10:36:35] <hellyeah> it worked
[10:36:39] <hellyeah> but sometimes not
[10:36:50] <taplar> so verify the sometimes that don't work
[10:37:12] <taplar> Tomatosoup1:what's the issue?
[10:37:25] <taplar> i can read code.  i can't read intention, :)
[10:37:44] <Tomatosoup1> i want to add class to the navbar on scroll
[10:37:48] <hellyeah> taplar:
[10:37:58] <hellyeah> i will show you at home with screenshot
[10:38:02] <Tomatosoup1> now it just change the bg color so i can see the change
[10:38:15] <hellyeah> anyway have a good day for now
[10:38:45] <taplar> Tomatosoup1:you don't have jquery included in your fiddle
[10:39:31] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/k8v2b01s/14/
[10:40:59] <Tomatosoup1> oh, thanks
[11:12:24] <ifohancroft> sry, I am back
[11:12:30] <ifohancroft> and ExtraSteve just that it is a domain
[11:47:50] <ifohancroft> Thank you guys. It worked. I edited the method I was using to validate an IP address (it just checked the passed value with a regex and returned true if it is ip and false if it's not. I added a second check again with regex to check if it's domain and only then if one of those is what it should be I returned true
[11:48:21] <taplar> :)
[11:49:55] <ifohancroft> Thank you very much for our help becaue I did learn new things today and I am happy that I did get to but without your help I wouldn't have been able to learn those new things and get the job done. Now I can end my work day that was supposed to be 5 hours but became almost 8 hours :D
[11:51:05] <taplar> hey, don't say that.  might have taken you longer, but i'm sure you'd have found something
[11:51:16] <taplar> and you learn more the more you struggle, :)
[11:51:26] <ifohancroft> That is what I mean. If it wasn't for your help it might have been longer
[11:52:24] <ifohancroft> and I guess even if it's a simple thing you need to do at work because someone else didn't finish his job, actually putting some thought into why are you fixing the problem the way you are is better and faster than just trying to find a quick fix without caring why it works
[11:53:07] <taplar> indeed.  quick fixes are a fast way to get spagetti code
[11:53:25] <robertmaxrees> only do a quick fix if the correct fix is quick ;)
[11:53:34] <robertmaxrees> or there really is a mitigating factor, like "the site is down"
[11:53:52] <ifohancroft> good point taplar and robbyoconnor
[11:53:59] <ifohancroft> robertmaxrees *
[11:54:00] <ifohancroft> sry
[11:54:03] <robertmaxrees> :) no biggie.
[11:54:18] <ifohancroft> well, I do love spaghetti and code taplar but yeah I don't love them together :D
[11:54:36] <taplar> even if you did, your co-workers would not
[11:55:18] <taplar> and nothing hurts more than getting to the point where you don't want to touch a code base because "who knows what will break"
[11:56:28] <afidegnum> hello, please can you offer a snippet of editable table? I have a 2 field Json data from remote url, and i want to load the data, Edit, Delete or add new one, all i m reading is still confusing,
[11:56:41] <robertmaxrees> afidegnum show us what you've tried.
[11:56:59] <robertmaxrees> afidegnum we'll help you get the job done, but we won't just hand you the code :)
[11:57:39] <ifohancroft> taplar: I guess I can try less awful version of spaghetti and code together: making js/html/css combo that will generate picture of spaghetti or write code on the table using spaghetti as letters :D
[11:57:53] <taplar> lol
[11:58:34] <taplar> ohhh even better, since i'm looking into it right now.  make a new font that looks like spagetti, :)
[11:59:06] <afidegnum> robertmaxrees: actually i have this, http://paste.ubuntu.com/14257927/    but i want to convert the what was initially there to a remote data load.   here is the original source, code of this app.    https://github.com/baig/jquerymobile-editablelistview/blob/master/demo/index.html
[12:00:22] <afidegnum> the json data is in a form of {  "name": [    "Electricity", "Water"]}
[12:00:27] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[12:00:32] <robertmaxrees> do you have a standalone example to work with?
[12:00:42] <afidegnum> yes, i have a stand alone data
[12:00:48] <robertmaxrees> i mean like a jsfiddle.
[12:00:54] <afidegnum> no
[12:00:59] <robertmaxrees> mind making one?
[12:01:02] <afidegnum> i have been workin gon my local pc
[12:01:17] <robertmaxrees> sure - but a test case would help us help you :)
[12:02:04] <afidegnum> what i needed is to change the actual array into a remote call
[12:11:10] <robertmaxrees> sorry had a meeting.
[14:36:36] <hellyeah> hey there
[14:37:48] <robertmaxrees> hello
[14:39:48] <hellyeah> hmm what i dont understand is when you drop button onto another one why i see space in the left side. Is there something wrong i did. Can you take a look http://jsfiddle.net/j2eco7u9/69/
[14:40:21] <robertmaxrees> what am i doing?
[14:44:17] <hellyeah> just drop a button onto another one
[14:44:34] <robertmaxrees> okay - so what's happening that shouldn't be?
[14:44:46] <hellyeah> hmm
[14:44:53] <hellyeah> there is a space in the div
[14:44:58] <hellyeah> you see that
[14:44:59] <robertmaxrees> there's no div.
[14:45:17] <robertmaxrees> you're creating a new UL as a direct child of another ul - you can't do that.
[14:46:27] <hellyeah> droppable div is not a div dont get it?
[14:46:51] <hellyeah> <ul><ul> did you mean this?
[14:47:22] <robertmaxrees> right, there is no "droppablediv" in that fiddle.
[14:48:27] <hellyeah> this pink area is not droppable div?
[14:48:28] <robertmaxrees> var div2 = $('<ul>'); - this is why you're confused.
[14:48:30] <robertmaxrees> that's not a div.
[14:48:32] <robertmaxrees> that's a ul.
[14:48:42] <hellyeah> oh
[14:48:46] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/j2eco7u9/71/
[14:48:47] <hellyeah> yeah right
[14:48:50] <robertmaxrees> this is all your code is doing.
[14:49:02] <robertmaxrees> what are you trying to accomplish?
[14:49:14] <hellyeah> but i add droppable div to the buttondiv
[14:49:23] <hellyeah> <div><ul><li>..
[14:49:31] <taplar> this still the same problem from earlier?
[14:50:06] <robertmaxrees> hellyeah you aren't doing that right now.
[14:50:09] <hellyeah> no different one
[14:50:24] <robertmaxrees> hellyeah you've been working on this same basic problem for a while.  have you considered backing up and starting over?
[14:51:02] <hellyeah> actually i am into different problem
[14:51:15] <robertmaxrees> lol what are you trying to build?
[14:51:37] <hellyeah> grouping button
[14:51:46] <robertmaxrees> "grouping button"?
[14:51:49] <taplar> what's your new problem?
[14:52:04] <hellyeah> taplar: btw the problem is not a problem that i meantioned earlier
[14:52:18] <taplar> did you figure out your earlier problem?
[14:52:32] <hellyeah> every scenerio works good here http://jsfiddle.net/j2eco7u9/69/
[14:52:47] <hellyeah> i can drag button in one area into another without problem
[14:53:24] <taplar> no, you still have your original issue
[14:53:40] <robertmaxrees> lol
[14:53:46] <robertmaxrees> woops, wrong window.
[14:53:49] <arc_> geez
[14:54:14] <taplar> grouping two buttons works.  dragging a third down to join that group does not work
[14:54:20] <taplar> which is what you were asking about earlier
[14:54:59] <taplar> and i told you to verify your assumption that you are indeed 'dropping' in that instance
[14:55:12] <robertmaxrees> taplar++
[14:55:20] <hellyeah> taplar:  i will show you screenshots
[14:55:25] <taplar> i don't need one
[14:55:27] <taplar> i know what the issue is
[14:55:30] <taplar> you need to find it
[14:55:53] <hellyeah> but it works let me show you
[14:56:01] <robertmaxrees> hellyeah screenshots do us no good.
[14:56:11] <hellyeah> okey i respect that
[14:56:21] <hellyeah> but i can put all buttons onto same div
[14:56:26] <taplar> hellyeah:drag two together
[14:56:31] <wa5ted> yo
[14:56:31] <taplar> then drag a third to join them
[14:56:43] <taplar> inspect the source and see if all three li's are grouped
[14:56:55] <taplar> you'll find only two are
[14:57:38] <hellyeah> i.e. inspector sucks
[14:57:47] <taplar> gotta learn to love it
[14:57:54] <taplar> it's your bread and butter
[14:57:58] <FilipNor1ic> then don't use ie?
[14:58:29] <robertmaxrees> hellyeah IE11, Edge, Chrome, and FF all have pretty good inspectorsd.
[14:58:35] <robertmaxrees> *inspectors
[14:59:16] <FilipNor1ic> I don't like the IE11 one it's alright but I don't enjoy using it
[14:59:52] <robertmaxrees> i think it's pretty close to being on par.  there are even a few features that make it a little nicer than chrome and ff's
[15:01:07] <FilipNor1ic> hellyeah: which IE are u using?
[15:01:26] <hellyeah> 11
[15:01:35] <robertmaxrees> that's actually a pretty good inspector.
[15:01:47] <hellyeah> hmm i got some errors
[15:01:58] <robertmaxrees> like what?
[15:02:51] <hellyeah> exception in window.load
[15:02:56] <RedPointyHat> o/ hi guys. working on a simple(ish) GM script
[15:03:09] <RedPointyHat> trying to see if there's a way i can search for a specific span title
[15:03:14] <hellyeah> anyway i installed google chrome
[15:03:16] <RedPointyHat> within a page
[15:03:24] <robertmaxrees> RedPointyHat "a specific span title"?
[15:03:27] <robertmaxrees> meaning...
[15:03:39] <RedPointyHat> ie: <span title="3 file(s)">Filelist</span>
[15:03:55] <RedPointyHat> i want to see if i have an element on my page with the title "3 file(s)"
[15:04:07] <robertmaxrees> why not use a class instead?
[15:04:22] <RedPointyHat> <RedPointyHat> o/ hi guys. working on a simple(ish) GM script
[15:04:27] <RedPointyHat> I'm not making the website
[15:04:31] <robertmaxrees> i don't know what "GM" means.
[15:04:36] <RedPointyHat> GreaseMonkey
[15:04:38] <taplar> what if you have 4 files?
[15:04:44] <RedPointyHat> taplar, then I want to do nothing.
[15:04:48] <robertmaxrees> ah - that would've been salient info ;)
[15:04:55] <RedPointyHat> Sorry robertmaxrees :P
[15:05:00] <robertmaxrees> and you want an attribute selector or use .filteR()
[15:05:04] <robertmaxrees> * filter()
[15:05:59] <RedPointyHat> Not really familiar with how to do that; I've read the docs but not exactly sure how they apply here
[15:06:12] <robertmaxrees> what docs have you read?
[15:06:22] <robertmaxrees> or what have you tried?  show us where you're getting stuck :)
[15:06:23] <hellyeah> taplar:  everything looks fine
[15:06:33] <RedPointyHat> http://api.jquery.com/filter/
[15:06:36] <hellyeah> there is seperate li
[15:06:37] <taplar> then we're looking at different fiddles
[15:06:48] <robertmaxrees> redbrick okay - so how did you use it?  what did you try?
[15:06:52] <RedPointyHat> but this is my first ever GM script / attempt at doing anything with jQuery so
[15:06:55] <robertmaxrees> err, RedPointyHat
[15:07:00] <robertmaxrees> okay, so let's step through it.
[15:07:23] <hellyeah> i wish i have a chance top copy dom to somewhere
[15:07:38] <robertmaxrees> RedPointyHat https://jsfiddle.net/f1pwwpgh/ is an example of the beginning of a test case.
[15:08:33] <robertmaxrees> in that javascript box, you can try things and just click "run" and see if they work - so what do you think you'd do?
[15:09:05] <hellyeah> taplar:  http://dpaste.com/0M8HSV4
[15:09:11] <RedPointyHat> K so lemme paste the structure of the website in there (at least, the relevant portion, 1 sec)
[15:09:16] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[15:09:17] <RedPointyHat> And I'll show you the code I've tried
[15:09:20] <robertmaxrees> RedPointyHat no need.
[15:09:27] <robertmaxrees> you already have a span in there with some text.
[15:09:36] <robertmaxrees> and a title attribute - so don't worry about the page for nopw.
[15:10:08] <RedPointyHat> right but i don't have the encapsulating object? or do i not need it?
[15:10:23] <robertmaxrees> RedPointyHat this is a standalone test case.
[15:10:31] <hellyeah> i guess i pissed taplar :o
[15:10:51] <robertmaxrees> all you're trying to do is see if there's a span with an attribute on a page.
[15:11:04] <RedPointyHat> true
[15:11:12] <robertmaxrees> so solve that problem - break things down :)
[15:11:27] <taplar> what's an easy place to upload an image?
[15:11:32] <hellyeah> ah
[15:11:33] <robertmaxrees> imgur
[15:11:36] <hellyeah> ic the error
[15:11:36] <taplar> k
[15:11:42] <RedPointyHat> $("span").filter("foo") ?
[15:11:50] <hellyeah> okey i am sorry abobut thid
[15:12:01] <robertmaxrees> RedPointyHat did you read the docs for .filter()?
[15:12:02] <taplar> what's the problem?
[15:12:14] <robertmaxrees> RedPointyHat and you'll probably need to read the docs for attribute selectors.
[15:12:15] <hellyeah> robertmaxrees: was right
[15:12:24] <robertmaxrees> hellyeah could you tell my wife that?
[15:12:25] <hellyeah> there is two ul
[15:12:26] <robertmaxrees> :)
[15:12:31] <taplar> no...
[15:12:39] <hellyeah> but there is two uls
[15:12:54] <hellyeah> ul ul li li li /ul /ul
[15:13:04] <hellyeah> if you chekc my dpaste link
[15:13:08] <RedPointyHat> I tried ... evidently I'm not understanding :/
[15:13:21] <robertmaxrees> RedPointyHat so what's an attribute selector? :)
[15:13:25] <robertmaxrees> let's tackle that.
[15:14:04] <RedPointyHat> Haven't read that docs, though they seem very complicated for my current level of knowledge LOL
[15:14:11] <robertmaxrees> https://api.jquery.com/attribute-equals-selector/
[15:14:16] <robertmaxrees> this is complicated?
[15:14:28] <RedPointyHat> For me? Yes. LOL
[15:14:32] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[15:14:34] <NoiseEee> how were your holidays robertmaxrees
[15:14:36] <RedPointyHat> I'm pretty computer illiterate
[15:14:36] <RedPointyHat> hehe
[15:14:39] <robertmaxrees> NoiseEee terrible.
[15:14:41] <robertmaxrees> yours?
[15:14:53] <NoiseEee> robertmaxrees: better than yours! sorry to hear!
[15:14:54] <robertmaxrees> RedPointyHat they even give you a working example.
[15:15:32] <robertmaxrees> RedPointyHat jQuery( "[attribute='value']" ) - any time you see "jQuery" in a code example, it's the same as $, so this is actually $("[attribute='value']")
[15:15:36] <taplar> hellyeah: http://i.imgur.com/NqTb4Oj.png
[15:15:42] <robertmaxrees> NoiseEee eh, it's been a pretty terrible year.
[15:15:53] <robertmaxrees> but thanks
[15:16:00] <hellyeah> taplar:  404
[15:16:25] <taplar> http://imgur.com/NqTb4Oj
[15:16:27] <RedPointyHat> Ahhhhhhhh gotcha
[15:16:28] <taplar> ?
[15:16:31] <RedPointyHat> so I need something like
[15:16:33] <robertmaxrees> RedPointyHat et the idea now?
[15:16:37] <RedPointyHat> $("span").filter("span[title='foo']").css( "background-color", "red" ) (just to change the background to red)
[15:16:53] <RedPointyHat> so; how could I replace that .css( ___ ) to be like my own function?
[15:16:53] <NoiseEee> robertmaxrees: well cheers for 2016
[15:17:02] <robertmaxrees> RedPointyHat no need for  $("span").filter("span[title='foo']") - you can just do  $("span[title='foo']")
[15:17:21] <hellyeah> it is okey now
[15:17:22] <robertmaxrees> RedPointyHat so you want to know if anything matches that selector?
[15:18:10] <hellyeah> taplar: " i just saw nothing
[15:18:18] <taplar> you see the pic?
[15:18:27] <hellyeah> no jus x symbol
[15:18:30] <taplar> :(
[15:18:37] <hellyeah> dunno why
[15:19:00] <hellyeah> hmm
[15:19:01] <RedPointyHat> So, would that just be if( $("span[title='foo']")) {
[15:19:04] <RedPointyHat> do stuff }
[15:19:09] <robertmaxrees> RedPointyHat nope.
[15:19:15] <RedPointyHat> Gah.
[15:19:17] <robertmaxrees> that'll give you a jquery object back, which is truthy.
[15:19:19] <robertmaxrees> welcome to js.
[15:19:51] <hellyeah> if you put ! in front of $ it means false
[15:19:54] <hellyeah> right
[15:19:57] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[15:19:59] <robertmaxrees> not helpful here.
[15:20:04] <hellyeah> sorry
[15:20:05] <robertmaxrees> and that's a negation operator.
[15:20:10] <robertmaxrees> it negates any check.
[15:20:27] <robertmaxrees> there are 6 falsy values - false, 0, '' (empty string), null, undefined, and NaN (numeric not a number)
[15:20:38] <hellyeah> taplar:  you can try tiny pics
[15:20:41] <robertmaxrees> everything else is true - you can use .length to get back the number of things you matched, though.
[15:20:53] <taplar> started to but they're doing popups so fk them
[15:21:20] <hellyeah> image shack
[15:21:23] <hellyeah> :p
[15:21:31] <taplar> http://postimg.org/image/m9lusyeyj/
[15:22:39] <hellyeah> you know what
[15:22:45] <hellyeah> this problem didnt occur in i.çe.
[15:22:48] <hellyeah> i.e.
[15:22:56] <hellyeah> but i got this problem in chrome
[15:22:59] <robertmaxrees> hellyeah it does, but ie is trying to fix it for you.
[15:23:06] <robertmaxrees> the issue is with your code.
[15:23:07] <hellyeah> it seems firefox has same problem
[15:23:19] <hellyeah> ic
[15:23:42] <hellyeah> taplar:  ic the problem can you give me some hints how to fix that?
[15:23:50] <taplar> already did
[15:23:57] <taplar> verify that your drop is indeed happening
[15:24:13] <taplar> if it's not, figure out why
[15:24:20] <RedPointyHat>     if($(this).filter("span[title='3 file(s)']")){
[15:24:20] <RedPointyHat>       hasThreeFiles = true;
[15:24:20] <RedPointyHat>     }
[15:24:20] <taplar> *hint: it's not
[15:24:26] <RedPointyHat> that seems to be wroking for me ... but it probably sin't
[15:25:30] <robertmaxrees> hey RedPointyHat please don't multiline paste in the channel.
[15:25:36] <robertmaxrees> and what is $(this)?
[15:26:04] <robertmaxrees> also, if($(this).filter("span[title='3 file(s)']")){ will always return true.
[15:26:05] <RedPointyHat> Sorry about that. And it's the object I'm in (doing this in an .each( function () {
[15:26:15] <robertmaxrees> so that's actually not a good check.
[15:26:27] <robertmaxrees> so you're doing a $('span').each() ?
[15:26:45] <RedPointyHat> No; let's not worry about that part for now
[15:26:50] <robertmaxrees> RedPointyHat err..
[15:26:55] <robertmaxrees> that's actually relevant.
[15:26:56] <RedPointyHat> I just wanna see how to do that check
[15:27:07] <robertmaxrees> right, that's relevant because it fundamentally changes how we do the check.
[15:27:16] <hellyeah> taplar:  is it about it has two ul
[15:27:21] <hellyeah> hmm
[15:27:30] <RedPointyHat> I have an item ID; for each item ID, I'm searching the filelist
[15:27:32] <RedPointyHat> it's not a span
[15:27:52] <robertmaxrees> 2 things - 1 an id can only happen once per page.
[15:27:53] <RedPointyHat> $this is the table representing the object with a given ID
[15:28:01] <robertmaxrees> 2 that's the same basic premise i was asking.
[15:28:05] <RedPointyHat> ID might be a bad example
[15:28:07] <robertmaxrees> the selector being different notwithstanding.
[15:28:09] <RedPointyHat> I mean, bad description
[15:28:15] <robertmaxrees> you probably mean class.
[15:28:45] <robertmaxrees> "i want so see if any spans have a particular attribute with a particular value" is distinct from "i need to know if the current element has a particular attribute with a particular value"
[15:29:23] <RedPointyHat> Ah. I guess I'm shooting for the latter
[15:29:34] <robertmaxrees> why are you using .each() though?
[15:29:39] <hellyeah> taplar:  what about this http://jsfiddle.net/j2eco7u9/72/
[15:29:53] <robertmaxrees> RedPointyHat your code above makes me a little nervous :)
[15:30:22] <taplar> does it work?
[15:30:42] <RedPointyHat> I'm adding buttons for each item, and then adding an extra button if 3 file(s) is in that current item's span
[15:31:09] <robertmaxrees> RedPointyHat ah, okay, then you're fine.  the missing var statement had me worried.
[15:31:13] <robertmaxrees> you want .prop() in this case.
[15:32:10] <RedPointyHat> instead of the filter?
[15:32:21] <robertmaxrees> it's a little more complicated than that.
[15:32:35] <robertmaxrees> but yeah, you won't use filter in this case.
[15:32:45] <hellyeah> taplar:  nicely
[15:32:52] <robertmaxrees> RedPointyHat https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/wzpLLsjn/1/
[15:33:09] <hellyeah> but you are the exper can you take a look?
[15:33:19] <RedPointyHat> btw robertmaxrees really appreciate you teaching me as opposed to just solving this for me
[15:33:26] <RedPointyHat> i'm sure it would've taken you two seconds
[15:33:33] <taplar> if i wasn't here, how would you know if it worked?
[15:33:47] <robertmaxrees> RedPointyHat that's the entire point of this channel :) thank you for being a willing learner :D
[15:35:40] <RedPointyHat> :). OK so this iterates through the spans, but that's not exactly the structure i have
[15:35:40] <hellyeah> taplar:  i dont get it what you mean http://jsfiddle.net/j2eco7u9/72/
[15:36:12] <taplar> your asking me if it worked
[15:36:14] <robertmaxrees> RedPointyHat $('span') could be any jquery collection.
[15:36:19] <taplar> you should be able to answer that for yourself
[15:36:38] <robertmaxrees> RedPointyHat notice how nothing inside of that .each() callback is concerned at all with what kind of element it is?
[15:36:50] <hellyeah> yea it worked
[15:36:50] <RedPointyHat> but isBar checks $this
[15:36:59] <RedPointyHat> in this case, it's all span objects right?
[15:37:08] <robertmaxrees> RedPointyHat what are you getting at?
[15:37:12] <RedPointyHat> but how do I make sure I get all of the spans within that other objects?
[15:37:21] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[15:37:25] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[15:37:29] <RedPointyHat> isBar = $this.prop('title') === 'bar';
[15:37:29] <robertmaxrees> now you've lost me.
[15:37:32] <RedPointyHat> that works because $this is a span
[15:37:33] <RedPointyHat> right?
[15:37:36] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[15:37:53] <robertmaxrees> $this could be any element.
[15:38:17] <robertmaxrees> or do you want to know if ANY element has title="foo"?
[15:38:28] <taplar> heh, back to the previous question
[15:38:41] <robertmaxrees> yeah... i guess i'm lost.
[15:39:01] <hellyeah> taplar:  pervious question?
[15:39:10] <taplar> that was directed at robert
[15:39:11] <RedPointyHat> sorry robertmaxrees I'm probably overthinking this ... lemme check if that works for me
[15:39:49] <RedPointyHat> I guess, yeah, if I could check if ANY element has title="foo" that wouldn't be a problem
[15:39:56] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[15:40:07] <taplar> could is possible.  should is the question
[15:40:08] <robertmaxrees> so in that example i shared above, they should ALL have a red outline?
[15:40:12] <RedPointyHat> hasThreeFiles = $(this).prop('title') === "3 file(s)" >> doesn't work for me
[15:40:13] <RedPointyHat> oh, no
[15:40:20] <RedPointyHat> only bar should have a red outline
[15:40:21] <RedPointyHat> but like
[15:40:23] <RedPointyHat> one sec
[15:40:26] <RedPointyHat> lemme mess with this for a second
[15:40:28] <RedPointyHat> and i'll update ya
[15:40:55] <robertmaxrees> something tells me the element is a parent or child.
[15:41:28] <arc_> it'd be really good to be able to see the html ...
[15:41:36] <taplar> such a dreamer
[15:41:37] <robertmaxrees> yeah, i'm thinking that's relevant at this point.
[15:41:55] <robertmaxrees> nah, i was pointing out earlier that the basic question and test case didn't need all of the html.
[15:41:58] <robertmaxrees> that's my bad ;)
[15:42:11] <RedPointyHat> it does all seeem pretty basic
[15:42:15] <RedPointyHat> i'm probably just being a dingus
[15:42:15] <RedPointyHat> lol
[15:42:56] <arc_> selecting can be a bit confusing
[15:43:02] <hellyeah> time to bad
[15:43:06] <hellyeah> good night
[15:43:14] <taplar> l8r
[15:43:34] <hellyeah> what is that?
[15:43:45] <taplar> ===later
[15:43:50] <robertmaxrees> "leighter"
[15:44:49] <hellyeah> aha
[15:44:53] <hellyeah> thats good one
[15:44:58] <hellyeah> anyway
[15:45:02] <hellyeah> i ate my yoghurt
[15:45:08] <hellyeah> now i am gonna sleep
[15:45:09] <djiboutiii> Hello, is this a good room to ask very newbish questions?
[15:45:14] <taplar> always
[15:45:19] <robertmaxrees> yep!
[15:45:20] <djiboutiii> Awesome.
[15:45:42] <taplar> easy questions make me feel intellagent
[15:47:50] <djiboutiii> I'm a true beginner. Looking at a jQuery grid. I'm trying to get an array of all selected items in a grid. I can get an individual row id, but I can't get an array of them. Can someone recommend where I can read up on this? Currently doing this: selected = grid.jqGrid('getGridParam', 'selrow');
[15:48:19] <robertmaxrees> can you make a jsfiddle of the problem?
[15:48:21] <djiboutiii> Which provides me with the last selected row, but I've got 3 selected and would like them all
[15:48:30] <djiboutiii> Sure - I'll work that up. Back in a few.
[15:48:36] <robertmaxrees> awesome! :D
[15:48:42] <djiboutiii> Thanks :)
[15:48:47] <taplar> not the beginner question i was expecting
[15:48:59] <robertmaxrees> seriously.
[15:49:24] <djiboutiii> Well believe me, once I get talking, you'll see I know nothing
[15:50:13] <taplar> do you have the site for the docs?
[15:50:16] <robertmaxrees> yay lunch. be back in a bit.
[15:50:21] <arc_> it already seems like you have more code sense than a lot of people who show up here ..
[15:50:36] * RedPointyHat raises his hand
[15:50:40] * RedPointyHat will probably give up
[15:51:02] <arc_> it doesn't seem like your problem is that hard, what happened to your html
[15:52:44] <RedPointyHat> there's quite a bit of personal info, and i'm too stupid to be confident that i've filtered it all out lol
[15:53:16] <arc_> ;/
[15:54:26] <RedPointyHat> lemme see
[15:59:10] <RedPointyHat> alright i guess this is fine
[15:59:17] <RedPointyHat> https://jsfiddle.net/c9fa2kmq/ (sorry, no idea why formatting is so ugly)
[15:59:32] <RedPointyHat> basically, i have a bunch of movies (that's what the $(this) is
[15:59:37] <RedPointyHat> that i'm iterating through)
[16:00:07] <RedPointyHat> and for each movie where the Filelist has 3 file(s) as the title of that linkbox span, I want to do something
[16:00:28] <manjaro-kde5-> I'm trying to include a jquery accordion into my squarespace website. I got it to work, but I want the content to have the same font style as my website. The jquery accordion that I added imposses its own font style. Here is the exact accordion and code that I added to my site. https://jqueryui.com/accordion/#no-auto-height
[16:01:24] <taplar> RedPointyHat:is there only that one item that has a title like that?
[16:01:32] <RedPointyHat> No
[16:01:44] <RedPointyHat> Let me expand
[16:02:03] <taplar> so there are multiple 'linkbox' elements?
[16:02:05] <RedPointyHat> 2 seconds
[16:02:35] <djiboutiii> Ah, sorry to have wasted any time. In figuring out how to lay this out in jsfiddle, I found my solution :) Instread of jqGrid('getGridParam', 'selrow'); I am getting the array now with jqGrid('getGridParam', 'selarrrow'); Thanks for the offer of help anyway. I'll be staying around with more questions for sure.
[16:02:51] <taplar> cool
[16:03:30] <RedPointyHat> https://jsfiddle.net/c9fa2kmq/
[16:03:33] <RedPointyHat> it looks more like this
[16:03:43] <RedPointyHat> there can be up to 10 movies on a page, the difference will be based on id
[16:03:48] <RedPointyHat> (75926, 12345)
[16:04:01] <RedPointyHat> so i iterate through all of the bas-cmovie-list__info__action's to do a certain task
[16:04:18] <arc_> you didn't update it
[16:04:27] <RedPointyHat> oops
[16:04:28] <RedPointyHat> lol
[16:04:29] <RedPointyHat> sorry
[16:04:31] <RedPointyHat> i just hit run
[16:04:43] <RedPointyHat> ^_^ (yes, i am a complete beginner, in case it wasn't clear from the other 100 dumb things i've done :P)
[16:04:51] <arc_> it's not a big deal
[16:05:22] <taplar> ok
[16:05:39] <taplar> so there are multiple outer spans with linkbox's in them, of which may have a span with your title in it
[16:06:30] <RedPointyHat> yes. for every one of those outer spans that has this inner span with my title, i want to turn the filelist red (for example)
[16:06:35] <RedPointyHat> or ... whatever
[16:06:48] <taplar> the span?
[16:07:04] <arc_> do any other elements exist with the same title
[16:07:32] <RedPointyHat> taplar, i just want to be able eto capture that as an event tbh
[16:07:52] <arc_> let's not get into any jargon yet
[16:07:53] <RedPointyHat> and then i can write the function (actually, i have stolen the function from a friend, it sends a post event)
[16:07:58] <taplar> just making sure i know what your wanting to turn red bordered
[16:08:17] <RedPointyHat> arc_, no
[16:08:18] <robertmaxrees> "post event" isn't a thing fwiw.
[16:09:02] <RedPointyHat> if it says 1 file(s) somewhere within that linkbox within that basic-movie-list__info__action , then i want to set hasOneFile to true
[16:09:18] <RedPointyHat> and 3 file(s) then hasThreeFiles to true
[16:09:21] <arc_> then you should be able to just do $("[title='3 file(s)']") to select all of those spans. now, whether the span is the thing you actually want to act on or not is another question
[16:09:46] <arc_> from this html, i don't really see what you want to turn red or do whatever else to
[16:09:52] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/c9fa2kmq/3/
[16:10:21] <RedPointyHat> arc_, I want to set a variable called HasOneFile or HasThreeFiles to true
[16:10:50] <arc_> that doesn't really make sense, because you are trying to act on multiple elements
[16:10:51] <NoiseEee> RedPointyHat: fwiw, if you control the markup, you can make your jquery searching wayyyy easier
[16:11:07] <NoiseEee> RedPointyHat: you could class items as 'onefile' or 'threefiles' and search by class
[16:11:14] <taplar> or use a data element
[16:11:16] <robertmaxrees> NoiseEee he's making a greasemonkey script.
[16:11:18] <arc_> it sounds like he's trying to make a userscript so
[16:11:23] <NoiseEee> ahhh ok
[16:12:27] <robertmaxrees> RedPointyHat mind providing a more complete fiddle? i take it you could have mutliple .basic-movie-list__info__action on the page, right?
[16:14:07] <arc_> if you could fill the data you're removing with dummy data instead of just deleting it, that would make it easier to understand what is going on
[16:15:54] <danemacmillan> Does anyone know of a simple method or library for checking the existence of nested object properties? For example,
[16:15:57] <danemacmillan> deepHas(object.property.nestedProperty), without having to pass the object, and then a string path.
[16:16:16] <RedPointyHat> What is missing from what I shared?
[16:16:30] <arc_> i don't know. it seems like there should be a list of something
[16:16:32] <robertmaxrees> RedPointyHat do you have multiple .basic-movie-list__info__action on the same page?
[16:16:37] <RedPointyHat> yes
[16:16:46] <RedPointyHat> I do in that fiddle too, don't I?
[16:16:53] <RedPointyHat> that's why I have my
[16:16:54] <taplar> yeah, did you see my edit?
[16:17:11] <robertmaxrees> oh, now i see it.
[16:17:25] <RedPointyHat> taplar, yes, but that's not really what I need either I don't think
[16:17:38] <RedPointyHat> brvsudr ...
[16:17:41] <RedPointyHat> jeez obob
[16:17:42] <RedPointyHat> because ...
[16:17:46] <robertmaxrees> one sec.
[16:17:49] <RedPointyHat> i need to do stuff to the buttons, it's not just a filter
[16:17:57] <taplar> i intentionally left stuff out
[16:19:04] <arc_> right. so we need to know what you actually need to do, not the way you have decided you should go about doing what you need to do
[16:19:19] <robertmaxrees> he already explained that.
[16:19:32] <arc_> i may have missed it
[16:19:43] <arc_> it's a long conversation
[16:19:46] <robertmaxrees> he's adding something to each .basic-movie-list__info__action and doing something when there's a child span with one or another particular title.
[16:19:48] <robertmaxrees> i see the issue.  sec.
[16:21:34] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/c9fa2kmq/6/
[16:22:56] <RedPointyHat> robertmaxrees, I owe ya one. I think from here I can finalize everything
[16:23:11] <robertmaxrees> is that what you were getting ad?
[16:23:12] <robertmaxrees> *at
[16:23:15] <robertmaxrees> that's fragile.
[16:23:17] <RedPointyHat> yes, pretty much.
[16:23:33] <RedPointyHat> can I ask why you use the var $this syntax? And also a comma instead of ; in line 2?
[16:23:49] <robertmaxrees> i'd probably use a .find('span').filter(function() { return $(this).text() === 'Filelist'; });
[16:24:06] <robertmaxrees> the var $this stores $(this) - $() is kind of expensive, so you generate it once and reuse as necessary.
[16:24:12] <robertmaxrees> and the comma combines var declarations.
[16:24:21] <robertmaxrees> if I used a semicolon, $fileList would be a global var, which is bad.
[16:25:39] <arc_> guess i've got something to try to learn about javascript ...
[16:25:49] <robertmaxrees> and that is?
[16:26:33] <arc_> well, i was going to read about how scope works and what $ before a variable name means
[16:26:41] <robertmaxrees> $ just means it's a jquery object.
[16:26:45] <robertmaxrees> it's a convention, nothing more.
[16:26:45] <taplar> $ before a variable is just semantics
[16:26:51] <arc_> ah, ok
[16:27:01] <robertmaxrees> scope in js is simple - go up until you hit a function.
[16:27:09] <robertmaxrees> there's your scope.
[16:27:13] <arc_> heh
[16:27:20] <arc_> so how would fileList have been a global
[16:27:29] <robertmaxrees> omitting the var declaration
[16:27:44] <robertmaxrees> doing var foo = 'string'; bar = 'somethingelse'; would make bar global.
[16:27:52] <robertmaxrees> you need a var statement before it or use commas.
[16:28:09] <arc_> all right. that was less required learning than it seemed like it was going to be
[16:28:14] <robertmaxrees> :)
[16:28:33] <robertmaxrees> scope is pretty simple, but people like to conflate it.
[16:28:46] <arc_> with what
[16:28:48] <RedPointyHat> thanks robertmaxrees arc_ taplar and everyone else :) really appreciate it guys
[16:29:09] <robertmaxrees> arc_ with other scoping rules.  it's all centered around functions.
[16:29:15] <arc_> i see
[20:56:01] <pickandmix> Hi guys, does anyone know how I can build a feature like this? http://postimg.org/image/sl4c7fqtt/
[20:56:03] <pickandmix> The + signs will expand the column, while the X signs will close the column.
[20:56:21] <robertmaxrees> that's pretty simple.
[20:56:23] <robertmaxrees> where are you stuck?
[20:57:25] <pickandmix> robertmaxrees, I'm not sure how I should start
[20:57:33] <pickandmix> Or even the term to google for
[20:57:39] <pickandmix> Could you give some guidance?
[20:57:51] <robertmaxrees> okay, so it sounds like you haven't even covered the basics.
[20:57:58] <pickandmix> Basics?
[20:58:02] <robertmaxrees> of jquery.
[20:58:07] <pickandmix> Perhaps you could let me know the terms to google for?
[20:58:13] <pickandmix> Hmm... Such as?
[20:58:16] <robertmaxrees> http://learn.jquery.com/ is a really good guide.
[20:58:36] <robertmaxrees> are you familiar with selectors?
[20:58:40] <pickandmix> Yes
[20:59:14] <robertmaxrees> then i'd skip to "events"
[20:59:24] <robertmaxrees> http://learn.jquery.com/events/
[20:59:28] <pickandmix> I believe I do know some jQuery. I'm just not too sure how I can build this.
[20:59:35] <pickandmix> Okay I'll take a look, sec.
[21:05:30] <robertmaxrees> and for the record, you really should ask in one channel at a time.
[21:05:50] <robertmaxrees> if you don't like the answer you're getting in one, provide feedback ;)
[21:13:13] <coldhead> burrrn
[21:15:38] <drej> he's gonna need some ice for that burn
