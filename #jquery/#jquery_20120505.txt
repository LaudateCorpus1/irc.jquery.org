[00:28:30] <mykii> hello
[00:28:37] <mykii> on http://jqueryui.com/download
[00:28:42] <mykii> links to themes doesn't work
[00:28:51] <mykii> such as : http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jqueryui/1.8.20/themes/base/jquery-ui.css
[00:30:51] <_zoggy_> right
[00:30:55] <_zoggy_> page got moved to google developers
[00:31:05] <Validatorian> Anyone know of a jQuery plugin that allows an element to slide up/down a page when scrolling, while constraining it to a container? I'm almost positive I've seen one before, but can't seem to find anything on google :-/
[00:31:31] <_zoggy_> https://developers.google.com/speed/libraries/devguide
[00:31:38] <_zoggy_> only up to 1.8.18 though
[00:49:54] <becom33> http://jsfiddle.net/7Yn36/ Im adding to a simple grid problem im having is i want to delete a raw after adding how can I do that
[00:52:55] * becom33 anyone ?
[00:53:17] <mykii> _zoggy_, thanks, so the problem comes from google ?
[01:05:40] * becom33 anyyone ?
[01:15:02] <becom33> in my script I have (1..3).each loop . well the problem is until the loop is done if I do a "print" to print the count . it won't print until the loop is complete . but if I do a puts it print on each round .
[01:17:19] <becom33> damn it wrong channel
[01:36:48] <Nece228> hello
[01:37:27] <Nece228> http://jsfiddle.net/hby9Y/
[01:37:43] <Nece228> can anyone tell me why nothing happens when i click on 'button'?
[01:38:13] <Nece228> im sure that something with that items.push is the problem, because if i declare a button in index.html it works fine
[01:38:31] <Nece228> but it doesnt work when i declare it inside the items.push
[01:39:28] <skylamer`> add jquery as library
[01:39:55] <Nece228> how to?
[01:40:23] <skylamer`> and u have no html
[01:40:27] <Nece228> i have
[01:40:30] <Nece228> lemme update
[01:40:50] <Whirl3d> nece28, you build your items and then  don't do anything with it
[01:41:04] <Nece228> http://jsfiddle.net/hby9Y/5/
[01:41:22] <Whirl3d> so you get an array of string values that look like html, butdo nothing with it.
[01:41:56] <Nece228> well it actually outputs json data in a table just fine
[01:42:06] <skylamer`> u have to put the correct urls
[01:42:32] <Nece228> the button has assigned correct id from mysql
[01:42:42] <Whirl3d> how does it do that? I mean, I'll take your word for it, but I can't see how it ever appends your content to the dom
[01:43:11] <Whirl3d> sorry, didn't tidy up the code
[01:44:11] <Nece228>  items.push('<tr><th>Title</th><th>Date</th></tr><tr><td>' + val.name + '</td><td>' + val.date + '</td><td><button id="'+ val.id +'">Delete Entry</button></td></tr>')
[01:44:21] <Nece228> notice <button id="'+ val.id +'">Delete Entry</button>
[01:45:01] <Nece228> that button shows up fine, but when i click on it the alert event doesnt happen, altough in html code when i click on meh button it works
[01:45:19] <skylamer`> ohhh
[01:45:27] <skylamer`> ure asking why the 'hanlder' isnt binded to dynamic data?
[01:45:52] <skylamer`> try with 'on'
[01:46:20] <Nece228> what do you mean by on?
[01:46:27] <Nece228> yeah its not binding
[01:46:30] <Whirl3d> or even put a 1 second timeout in betwen appending the table and assigning the button handler
[01:46:43] <javalover> how can I make it so when I scroll my mouse it scrolls the content inside a div?
[01:47:03] <Whirl3d> ?.mousewheel @ javalover
[01:47:10] <Whirl3d> drats.
[01:47:23] <Whirl3d> there's a mousewheel plugin for that, havalover
[01:47:26] <Whirl3d> javalover, sorry
[01:48:03] <javalover> ok so that's the best way theN?
[01:48:09] <javalover> i'm asking cuz i'd like it to apply to a phone as well
[01:48:15] <Whirl3d> to use the mousewheel plugin
[01:48:18] <javalover> case they invent a new way to scroll in the future
[01:48:36] <javalover> i'd like it to apply strictly to scrolling not just to mousewheel detection
[01:48:52] <Whirl3d> then what did you mean by when you scroll your mouse
[01:49:21] <javalover> well that's one way of scrolling i don't have enough vocabulary to describe it
[01:49:25] <Nece228> $('button').on("click", function() {alert("hah")}); still doesnt work
[01:49:26] <javalover> but i mean precisely that i'm probably going to override mousewheel
[01:49:38] <Whirl3d> if  you are asking how to bind the scroll event, you can use the shortcut syntax: $("el").scroll(handler)
[01:49:40] <javalover> i was just hoping maybe there was something just for the scroll call the mouse makes
[01:49:58] <javalover> and that will change it?
[01:50:12] <javalover> like if I scroll down using the windows arrow it'll do my action?
[01:50:19] <javalover> by windows arrow i mean on the scroller
[01:50:25] <javalover> the up & down or scroll bar on the side
[01:50:27] <Whirl3d> if you have a scrolling div selected, yes
[01:50:36] <javalover> wow lets try
[01:50:44] <javalover> does it have to be "el"?
[01:50:45] <Whirl3d> or touchscreen or anything that scrolls the page content
[01:50:52] <javalover> or is that where i put my div?
[01:50:58] <Whirl3d> our div
[01:51:01] <javalover> kk
[01:51:10] <Whirl3d> my y key has something under it. LOL
[01:51:18] <Nece228> anyone?
[01:51:58] <Whirl3d> Nece228, try this: $("table").on("click","button", function (e) {
[01:53:11] <Nece228> still doesnt work
[01:53:33] <Whirl3d> but you see the table?
[01:53:53] <Nece228> yeah i see
[01:54:03] <Whirl3d> then do this: $("table").on("click", function (e) {console. log(e);})
[01:54:03] <Nece228> but i saw it before too
[01:54:11] <javalover> lol i applied it to window scroll & it crashed the browser lol
[01:54:31] <Whirl3d> then look through the event and figure out what is happening when you click on a button.
[01:54:45] <Whirl3d> javalover, I don't think the window is a scrollable html element.
[01:55:07] <Nece228> the funny thing is
[01:55:11] <Whirl3d> you might want to do like we discussed and stick with a div or even perhaps "body"
[01:55:17] <Nece228> that when i look at html source i dont see table in here
[01:55:26] <Nece228> but when i inspect elements i see it
[01:55:42] <Whirl3d> that's because it'sadded later
[01:55:44] <javalover> i tried on the div & it didn't work
[01:55:56] <javalover> i want it to be that I scroll and it scrolls content in div
[01:56:01] <javalover> well i'm gonna make it so it's on hover
[01:56:06] <javalover> but..
[01:56:17] <javalover> idk i just want to ovverride the scroll function for the window
[01:56:24] <Whirl3d> javalover, paste your code in a fiddle and I'll look at it
[01:56:36] <Whirl3d> the window doesn't scroll
[01:56:42] <Nece228> well your last line also doesnt work
[01:56:54] <Whirl3d> what doesn't work?
[01:57:03] <Nece228> $("table").on("click", function (e) {console. log(e);})
[01:57:14] <Whirl3d> Are you doing that after you append the table to the dom?
[01:57:26] <Nece228> yeah
[01:57:38] <Whirl3d> if so, put this line between the two:  var t=setTimeout($.noop(), 1000);
[01:57:42] <Whirl3d> then try it again
[01:57:57] <Nece228> http://jsfiddle.net/hby9Y/8/
[01:59:39] <Whirl3d> Nece228, what is script.js?
[02:00:09] <Nece228> that file
[02:00:22] <Nece228> which i pasted in jsfiddle
[02:01:40] <Whirl3d> first of all, the html panel should just contain those things in your body...notthe header, not the html declaration.
[02:02:03] <Whirl3d> not jquery or jqueryui, not even any third party plugins. the body content only
[02:02:21] <Whirl3d> if you need 3rd party plugins and such, you use the ADD RESOURCES button to the left
[02:02:35] <Whirl3d> add them individually (but not the one your are testing)
[02:02:47] <Whirl3d> the one you are testing goes in the javascript panel (like you have it)
[02:04:30] <Whirl3d> I have found that it works okay sometimes to add the <base href='mydomain.com'> to the html to set the baseref and therefore use my local relative urls. Doesn't always work but its worth a try
[02:06:50] <Whirl3d> Plus , you should probably use .map instead of .each
[02:07:02] <Nece228> hm
[02:07:30] <javalover> well this sucks
[02:07:36] <javalover> when setting up a jsfiddle the div thing worked...
[02:08:15] <Whirl3d> and since you need the button elements to be elements and not just html, create them with javascript. Build your table first, append it to the dom and then use a loop to append the button elements that you create using Document.createElement()
[02:08:46] <Whirl3d> yep. Sounds like a css thing
[02:10:21] <javalover> http://jsfiddle.net/gZTKJ/13/
[02:10:23] <javalover> ok whirle I have an idea
[02:10:32] <javalover> you see how if you hover the div it scrolls inside the div
[02:10:40] <javalover> i want to do that...but not while on hover, while i'm on the outside of the div
[02:11:19] <Whirl3d> you mean using your mousewheel?
[02:11:29] <javalover> yes or any form of scrolling for that matter
[02:11:44] <javalover> so if i scrol the window, it should scroll the div...course that one does sound like it wouldn't work
[02:11:55] <Whirl3d> the WINDOW DOESN"T SCROLL
[02:12:11] <javalover> k well you get the basic idea
[02:12:20] <javalover> i'd like to focus the div for scrolling permanantely
[02:12:27] <javalover> noooooooooooo
[02:23:28] <javalover> how can I focus a div so that when the user scrolls it scrolls the content in the div not the window
[02:28:49] <ravenzz> you need to have a fixed height and overflow-y:scroll to the div
[02:28:53] <ravenzz> javalover
[02:30:39] <javalover> hi
[02:31:03] <javalover> i want it to be that if i scroll outside of the div, it still scrolls the div
[02:31:54] <javalover> basically on click, all scrolling should go to that div no matter where my mouse is
[02:32:21] <ravenzz> on click what?
[02:32:23] <ravenzz> :)
[02:32:31] <javalover> say i click the div
[02:32:43] <javalover> then now i move my mouse outside the div & I try to scroll
[02:32:46] <javalover> it should scroll that div
[02:33:05] <ravenzz> ok
[02:33:09] <javalover> or right when I load the site if I try scrolling, it scrolls that div
[02:35:33] <javalover> is there a way to do this?
[02:38:06] <ravenzz> javalover maybe jQuery mousewheel could help you
[02:38:17] <Nece228> i still cant figure this
[02:38:49] <Nece228> cant find a way to bind a handler to dynamic data
[02:40:25] <javalover> maybe
[02:41:38] <nights> hi
[02:41:50] <nights> im using jquery UI and wondering if theres a way to switch to eager loading of tabs
[02:41:53] <nights> for googlebot etc
[02:44:42] <pjammer> Looking to make jquery UI work with multiple input fields. these fields get dynamically added when a user hits the 'Add another field' button.  The new field pops up but without autocomplete working on it.
[02:45:38] <pjammer> This answer looks like it should work, but isn't being applied to the new fields. http://stackoverflow.com/a/9145194/156561
[02:45:49] <pjammer> any help would kick arse.
[02:48:16] <pjammer> oh i may have found something.
[02:56:10] <pjammer> nope
[03:37:47] <Nece228> interesting enough
[03:37:55] <Nece228> with dynamic html
[03:38:03] <Nece228> $('button').live('click', function()
[03:38:07] <Nece228> works just fine fine
[03:38:19] <Nece228> but $('button').on('click', function() doesnt work
[03:38:28] <Nece228> altough live is no longer recommended
[03:38:37] <Nece228> why is that so? i have jquery 1.7.2
[03:42:32] <dr0id> $(document).on('click', 'button', function() {});
[03:42:46] <dr0id> replace document with your parent selector
[03:43:52] <Nece228> ah thanks
[03:44:03] <Nece228> i need to always specify the parent selector
[03:44:20] <dr0id> $('button').on('click'... is like $('button').click(.. or $('button').bind('click'..
[04:00:40] <nights> cant get the jquery combobox to run
[04:00:44] <nights> anyone been successful with this=¨
[04:07:05] <pjammer> is there a way to tell jquery to apply itself after a dynamic field is added to a page?  i don't know how to ask this in a language you'd prefer.
[04:27:53] <Nece228> $.post('delete.php', {value: val.id},
[04:28:13] <Nece228> i need to find a way that the button i press value wouldnt be need to declared
[04:29:28] <Nece228> the value should be equal to the button which i press value=
[04:30:11] <Nece228> for instance html button value is equal to foo, then how to declare that with $.post?
[04:30:41] <devinceartas> Play around with console.log( this)  to find where the value is?
[04:31:14] <skylamer`> this.attr(id)
[04:31:21] <skylamer`> or if the button is 'val'
[04:31:26] <skylamer`> val.attr(id)
[04:35:03] <Nece228> you mean like this: $.post('delete.php', {value: this.attr(id)}, function(data) {
[04:35:18] <Nece228> console shows me that the id is not defined
[04:35:29] <Nece228> altought thats the button
[04:35:30] <Nece228> <button id="deletebutton" name="value" value="2">Delete Entry</button>
[04:36:11] <Nece228> btw the button is dynamic
[04:36:15] <Nece228> perhaps thats why?
[04:36:38] <skylamer`> no u dont refer on this like this
[04:37:03] <skylamer`> first make a var butt = the element of the button here ( $('#deletebutton') )
[04:37:26] <skylamer`> then in the post of your go with butt.val()
[04:41:34] <Nece228> hmm
[04:41:40] <Nece228> i dont understand
[04:42:08] <Nece228> http://paste.opensuse.org/5198274
[04:42:51] <Nece228> im doing something wrong here right?
[04:43:22] <Nece228> #deletebutton has "value" which i need to extract
[04:53:04] <skylamer`> can u paste it somewhereelse?
[04:53:34] <Nece228> ah i fixed it
[04:53:45] <Nece228> $.post('delete.php', {value: $(this).attr('value')}, function(data) {
[04:53:49] <Nece228> this is what i had to do
[04:53:54] <skylamer`> grats
[04:54:03] <skylamer`> u can do it with 'val()' also :)
[04:54:18] <Nece228> thanks, ill keep that in mind
[04:56:50] <unclemantis> while using autocomplete is there way to force a match?
[05:11:01] <xec> unclemantis: what do you mean by "force a match"?
[05:19:09] <pjammer> .live thanks. *drops mic*
[05:30:42] <bobbytek2> Is there an autocomplete that can handle hundreds of thousands of entries?
[05:31:19] <iamntz> bobbytek2: probably you should combine with some server-side thing
[05:31:37] <bobbytek2> iamntz, already doing server side filtering
[05:32:17] <bobbytek2> this is an autocomplete for our system's usernames
[05:32:19] <iamntz> and you still have hundreds of thousants?
[05:32:27] <bobbytek2> names can be as short as 2 chars
[05:32:47] <bobbytek2> we have about 300k users
[05:33:09] <a2bc> i try to use the .dialog() of jQuery UI. Everytime i open the dialog, the page gets ~5000px of height added. Does someone know why?
[05:33:09] <bobbytek2> sometimes a single letter can return tens of thousands
[05:33:18] <iamntz> then probably you may want to return only 2 chars names when users enters 2chars
[05:33:27] <bobbytek2> iamntz, right
[05:33:43] <bobbytek2> I need to double check we don't have 1 char names, lol :)
[05:34:02] <bobbytek2> iamntz, ever use the "chosen" plugin?
[05:34:07] <iamntz> i mean do even more filtering on sql query, not only a LIKE %foo% or so :)
[05:34:12] <iamntz> never heard of it :)
[05:34:13] <bobbytek2> That's what I'm currently trying to get it working with
[05:34:18] <bobbytek2> It's pretty slick
[05:34:26] <iamntz> ahong, saw it
[05:35:52] <iamntz> chosen does remote query as well?
[05:37:16] <bobbytek2> iamntz, no, I have to hack it a bit
[05:37:35] <bobbytek2> I was just going to use event delegation to grab the keyup event
[05:37:43] <iamntz> oksushi, so i would filter results in 2 parts
[05:37:53] <iamntz> omg, my keyboard is sick! :)
[05:37:59] <iamntz> without sushi :D
[05:38:00] <bobbytek2> which I got working, but it crawls when 20k results are returned
[05:38:05] <iamntz> http://blog.meltingice.net/programming/bootstrapping-chosen-ajax-autocomplete/
[05:38:17] <bobbytek2> saw that article
[05:38:22] <bobbytek2> thx
[05:38:28] <iamntz> i guess you don't have too many 2 letter names, no?
[05:38:32] <unclemantis> while using autocomplete is there way to force a match?
[05:39:14] <bobbytek2> iamntz, no, 377
[05:39:19] <bobbytek2> and one 1 letter name
[05:39:25] <bobbytek2> 'x' :)
[05:39:52] <iamntz> most likely you really don't need autocomplete for less than 3 letters :)
[05:40:08] <iamntz> i mean cmon, nobody is THAT lazy and don't want to type 2-3 letter :P
[05:40:21] <bobbytek2> iamntz, what if you want to ensure that they actually type something correct?
[05:40:26] <bobbytek2> that is the main purpose
[05:40:48] <bobbytek2> that's why I like chosen, it forces you to have a correct value
[05:40:55] <iamntz> oksushi, then do a split query, if you have less than 3 chars, return only 3chars users
[05:41:02] <bobbytek2> you can't have the control in an  invalid state
[05:41:05] <iamntz> if you have more, well... return more :)
[05:41:30] <bobbytek2> right, okay might do that :)
[05:41:38] <bobbytek2> thanks for the advice
[05:41:53] <bobbytek2> but who is oksushi ? :)
[05:42:31] <iamntz> i mean the other way would be to do the filtering on client side, but i guess you want to avoid this :)
[05:42:41] <bobbytek2> I tried that initially
[05:42:43] <bobbytek2> no dice
[05:42:44] <iamntz> oksushi is my stupid keyboard :)
[05:42:57] <sh0ne> Is there a way to clone a html tag (i.e. select tag) with different id each time?
[05:42:58] <iamntz> and my silly fingers :))
[05:43:01] <bobbytek2> way too many elements
[05:43:23] <iamntz> sh0ne, $('select').clone().attr('id', newID)
[05:45:40] <sh0ne> iamntz: yes, I did that, but I cannot enter newID manually because its part of the request and the number of select tags being cloned may vary..
[05:46:25] <iamntz> then do a loop: $('select').clone().each( function( i ){ this.id = newID+ i; })
[05:48:13] <sh0ne> iamntz: thank you, I was wondering it that possible somehow, but failed to realize myself..I'am a newbie with jQuery, thank you, A'll try right away
[05:49:40] <unclemantis> while using autocomplete is there way to force a match?
[05:53:57] <iamntz> unclemantis, ajax autocomplete or array?
[05:56:40] <unclemantis> ajax
[05:57:49] <iamntz> then you have to filter results on server side, maybe a more strict sql query?
[05:59:14] <Famic> I am setting myImage.css('top',value) in a .each function. console log right after that shows it got applied. console log right after the .each() says it's at 0. Any idea ?
[06:20:37] <javalover> hi i've been at this for hours now
[06:20:47] <javalover> I have a js plugin known as lionbars
[06:20:59] <javalover> this plugin creates it's own variables which it uses to scroll itself
[06:21:17] <javalover> now i've gotten the content to scroll but the problem is a certain variable that is asigned I cannot figure out how to change
[06:21:34] <javalover> my question is this, how do you change a javascript variable that is associated with a div
[06:21:57] <javalover> i'm just confused as to how variables work in javascript & the scope of things
[06:22:13] <javalover> is there a way to list all variables associated with a certain element?
[06:32:46] <sweb1> i need prototype for create jquery plugin ? where is latest documentation ?
[06:33:45] <iamntz> sweb1, you don't need prototype (or any other lib) check this out: http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Authoring

Origin http://sermonbob.be is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Origin., i looked it up but don't seem to find an descent solution, anyone who can help
[07:21:26] <hobs> are you accessing that from another site
[07:28:27] <BobSermon> hii, i'm having an issue with XMLHttpRequest cannot load http://www.sermonbob.be/contact/sendMail. Origin http://sermonbob.be is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Origin. trying to send a mail trough a form
[07:41:20] <hobs> yep
[07:41:33] <c0defr3ak> hello ppl
[07:41:45] <hobs> are you trying to run the javascript on another domain
[07:43:14] <hobs> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same_origin_policy
[07:54:41] <Industrial> Can I do this prettier? +$('#home').css('padding-top').split('px')[0];
[07:56:02] <ajpiano> parseInt( $("#home").css("padding-top"), 10 );
[07:56:39] <varnie> hello.
[07:56:49] <Industrial> but .css returns "32px", not a number
[07:57:19] <varnie> I have "$.browser is undefined" and apart from that I figured out that jQuery('div') works but $('div') does not. what are my mistakes?
[07:58:24] <Ret12> Industrial: http://dochub.io/#javascript/parseint
[08:02:07] <sevenaces> Small help people.
[08:02:26] <sevenaces> so, I'm trying to create a plugin for jQuery, and I'm using the outerHeight property
[08:02:42] <sevenaces> but it's giving me different values on refresh
[08:02:52] <sevenaces> Shuttling between two values. randomly
[08:02:56] <sevenaces> Any leads?
[08:03:22] <BobSermon> I do $data['respond'] = array('name' => $name, 'email' => $email, 'message' => $message); echo $_GET['callback'] . '('.json_encode($data).')'; and still when i alert the data in $data he puts every value on false, how does it come?
[08:06:23] <iamntz> sevenaces: if you have an image in that element, that may be the cause. you can either specify height on images (best practice, btw) or add an `onload` event for each image and automatically recompute the height of the element after each image is loaded
[08:06:36] <sevenaces> Nops. No image. Currently blank
[08:07:02] <Industrial> Ret12: I see.
[08:07:20] <sevenaces> iamntz: the layout is like <section><article><p>content</p></article>...{6 more similar articles}... </section>
[08:07:42] <varnie> if some lib overrides $ function how can I use it for calling juery?
[08:07:46] <iamntz> what browser? section/articles have floats, absolute positions etc?
[08:07:58] <iamntz> can you post it on jsfiddle/gist?
[08:08:34] <sevenaces> one moment
[08:10:20] <sevenaces> iamntz: http://jsfiddle.net/NZApC/
[08:12:33] <iamntz> sevenaces: btw, instead of doing that nth-child you could do an each loop
[08:12:40] <iamntz> let's see the problem tho
[08:12:48] <ShaunBaker> varnie — you will need to place jQuery in noconflict.
[08:12:53] <sevenaces> I earlier thought that was the problem, so removed that :)
[08:12:54] <ShaunBaker> see here http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.noConflict/
[08:13:38] <varnie> ShaunBaker, just before I load another lib?
[08:15:34] <iamntz> sevenaces: that sounds silly, but did you tried to move css inclusion file before js ?
[08:16:01] <ShaunBaker> if you read that page it provides the instruction for use. for example you can do something like this $jq = $.noConflict();
[08:16:01] <ShaunBaker> then use $jq instead of $
[08:16:15] <sevenaces> iamntz: let me try
[08:16:47] <sevenaces> iamntz: And now I feel stupid.
[08:16:58] <iamntz> works?
[08:17:06] <sevenaces> iamtz: Yea. :D
[08:17:10] <iamntz> good :)
[08:17:14] <sevenaces> not quite sure why this happened though
[08:17:17] <sevenaces> any clue?
[08:17:23] <iamntz> css should be included first
[08:17:28] <iamntz> js last (in footer, preferably)
[08:17:34] <varnie> I have included two scripts: jquery and someScript. then, after that I include some third script which has weird function "function $(name){return document.getElementById(name);}. and now when page loads and I enter "$('div') it will return null;
[08:17:47] <iamntz> is something related to script blocking and stuff like that
[08:18:14] <sevenaces> iamntz: Ah. That makes sense. Although, if I run it only on document.ready, shouldn't that not create problems?
[08:18:40] <iamntz> if you are old enough in this area, you probably remember the unstyled flash that old browser did on page load :)
[08:18:56] <iamntz> sevenaces: well... browers are weird creatures :)
[08:19:06] <sevenaces> hahaha/
[08:19:11] <sevenaces> thanks a tonne :D
[08:19:29] <sevenaces> I am scared of testing this in IE once it's done
[08:19:52] <iamntz> sevenaces: you know that IE need a shim for html5 elements, right?
[08:20:08] <sevenaces> yea :)
[08:20:13] <sevenaces> That's there in the project
[08:20:18] <sevenaces> this is just a library I'm making
[08:20:24] <sevenaces> *plugin
[08:20:55] <iamntz> sevenaces: also, be aware that html5 elements that are injected into dom wont be recognized by ie, you also need a trick there too
[08:21:01] <iamntz> but i guess you already knew that
[08:21:15] <sevenaces> no. I do not know what
[08:21:18] <sevenaces> What's that now?
[08:21:56] <iamntz> let me find, w8
[08:22:04] <varnie> can I prevent usage of "$" for jquery code?
[08:22:25] <varnie> err.. preserve
[08:22:46] <iamntz> varnie: jQuery(function( $ ){ /* do your $ code */ })
[08:23:28] <varnie> some of libs override $ function.
[08:23:47] <varnie> and after that old libs which use $ function don't work
[08:23:55] <iamntz> varnie: read about scopes & closures please. if you do that way, no lib will be able to override that
[08:25:04] <iamntz> sevenaces: it seems that what you need was innerShiv, which was merged into html5shiv: http://code.google.com/p/html5shiv/
[08:25:11] <iamntz> so if you use this, you should be ok
[08:26:22] <sevenaces> iamntz: Ah. This. I had that in my project included. No clue what it did, till now :P
[08:27:49] <incog> man i am gay
[08:27:51] <incog> confirmed
[08:27:52] <incog> gay for dick

[08:41:25] <szikael> the point is how to define name of div in var and than how to use it
[08:44:35] <szikael> any one ? I think its quite easy issue.
[08:45:51] <xec> szikael: lose the quotes, it's already a string

[08:47:44] <szikael> 	 var hight = $(element).height();
[08:47:50] <szikael> fule code
[08:49:25] <xec> szikael: does it work if you use that string as a selector?
[08:51:24] <xec> szikael: http://jsfiddle.net/r6nFZ/
[08:53:39] <szikael> ok guys you were right , i ware right but i made mistake few line after that one ;P sorry for bodering you
[08:55:18] <xec> no worries
[09:04:15] <sevenaces> I know I'm slow, but trying to make my first jQuery plugin, and it's feels exciting :D
[09:15:18] <xec> sevenaces: cool, what are you making?
[09:16:01] <sevenaces> Making a plugin, which would bing the background image of a div, and scroll it a little differently according to browser heights
[09:16:06] <sevenaces> xec ^
[09:17:06] <xec> ah, like a parallax effect?
[09:17:53] <sevenaces> xec: Sort of parallax, but a little different.
[09:19:48] <tomasm-> anyone familiar enough with the ajaxForm plugin? I'm trying to see whether the 'success' handler is fired after the form is complete. I'm uploading a file and need to (manually) refresh an image (outside of the target) after upload. I'm hoping 'success' is at the right time
[09:19:53] <xec> sevenaces: feel free to show off your work when you got something to show :)
[09:20:13] <sevenaces> I will :)
[09:20:55] <sevenaces> There is a conference happening, here in India on Handling Big Data. Called FifthElephant. I have to make the website. Hoping it's done soon. Will show. :)
[09:46:33] <DartmanX> does anyone know if there is a good JSP taglib encapsulating jquery besides the JSF-specific ones like Primefaces? I'm trying to escape the hell of JSF.
[10:29:56] <SeaOrifice> i want to move the li which is clicked to the first in the ul and the first to its position.. how do i do that ??? : This is the code i was trying but its not working out : http://pastebin.com/35cUzBgQ . Plz help
[10:38:04] <chuwiey> Hi all, i'm trying to overlay a div above a flash object. I don't have control over the page which I'm trying to overlay because my div is created via javascript once my user clicks the bookmarklet. I'm setting wmode to opaque dynamically, but that doesn't seem to make a difference. any ideas?
[10:41:54] <ravenzz> if you don't have any control over the flash object (you cannot set its wmode property to transparent) there is no way to do that
[10:54:57] <chuwiey> ravenzz: i can add wmode dynamically...
[10:59:38] <aaronmcadam> testing
[11:02:03] <dawin> hi folks

[11:37:57] <taybin_> what is up with api.jquery.com? :'(
[11:38:31] <taybin_> is there a backup site?
[11:47:43] <szikael> Is there a way to know number of divs / blocks inside parent div ?
[11:48:26] <MoTiOnXml> szikael: yes - count them ;)
[11:48:32] <szikael> ha ha :)
[11:48:48] <szikael> other solutions ?
[11:48:59] <MoTiOnXml> no, count them
[11:49:23] <MoTiOnXml> there are plenty of ways in jQuery to do that
[11:51:17] <szikael> i am new with this but :  var count = $('#parent div').length sonething like it ?

[13:02:25] <Whirl3d> Good afternoon
[13:02:27] <dawin> hmm
[13:02:30] <dawin> can you use
[13:02:51] <dawin> $('#imageTarget').load and attr on the same Dom Element?
[13:03:04] <dawin> i mean
[13:03:28] <dawin> swap the normal image with a preloader then when the attr(src) is loaded swap it
[13:03:46] <Whirl3d> yes
[13:03:57] <grantg> hey
[13:04:00] <dawin> without creating a pseudo dom element?
[13:04:13] <Whirl3d> but there are things to consider when loading images/preloading images
[13:04:17] <Whirl3d> grantg, hey
[13:04:18] <Acrack> yo Whirl3d
[13:04:31] <Whirl3d> Acrack, what's up?
[13:04:36] <Whirl3d> you get some sleep?
[13:04:43] <joeyinbox> hi folks :)
[13:04:57] <Whirl3d> hello joeyinbox
[13:05:00] <dawin> whirl what do you mean? :)
[13:05:03] <Acrack> i tried your code
[13:05:05] <dawin> what to consider for example?
[13:05:11] <joeyinbox> do someone know what happened to the api pages? It looks down
[13:05:16] <Acrack> i didn't manage to make it work xD
[13:05:25] <grantg> hey Whirl3d
[13:05:36] <Acrack> Whirl3d: is it good to do it like this ?
[13:05:45] <cobexer> joeyinbox: just wanted to say the same =/
[13:05:45] <Whirl3d> when preloading images in IE, for example, if the image already exists in the browser cache, it won't fire the load success handler...you never know that it has loaded
[13:06:00] <Acrack> if the guy have 100 games
[13:06:13] <dawin> ow
[13:06:30] <dawin> each ie?
[13:06:48] <Whirl3d> Acrack, sure. you load 100 games into the sliderHolder (which is bigger than the window) and slide the slider back and forth exposing only the images you want
[13:07:19] <Acrack> is it good for perfs ?
[13:08:15] <Acrack> cause .hide() looks better
[13:08:17] <Whirl3d> dawin, there's an easy work around for it. I almost always use this simple code: var Image=new Image(); var img=$(Image); img.load(loadHandlerfunc).attr("src",url); if (Image.complete) img.trigger("load");
[13:08:25] <Acrack> did you see my first code ?
[13:09:04] <Whirl3d> Acrack. your first code that didn't work
[13:09:25] <Acrack> it work but only for one ^^
[13:09:39] <Whirl3d> well then you are set!
[13:09:57] <Acrack> i dunno how to put more than 1 game
[13:09:59] <Acrack> xD
[13:10:37] <dawin>  thanks buddy
[13:10:41] <Whirl3d> I am afraid that if you aren't interested in doing it the way that I showed you (which is the only way I have ever seen it done correctly), than you are gonna have to find someone else that will help.
[13:11:20] <Whirl3d> No bad feelings, just that I am not gonna be able to help you the way you want. Sorry.
[13:11:31] <Acrack> no problem ^^
[13:11:38] <Acrack> you already done a lot :p thanks
[13:13:26] <Whirl3d> dawin, here is something else to consider...by loading the image the way that I just showed you, you never append it to the dom until it's ready. In fact, you don't even have to append it to the dom (which is the time-costly part of the process other than loading)...you can just swap the src attr in your load success function
[13:14:56] <Whirl3d> so you loadSuccessFunc would look like loadHandlerFunc=function () {$("#targetImage").attr("src",url); and voila it's loaded into the same image holder that your preloader image was using.
[13:16:29] <Whirl3d> joeyinbox, they are dilligently working on improving the api, forums (sort of) and plugins. It may be a little spotty, but they are doing their best. Give it a couple of minutes and try it again.
[13:17:34] <Whirl3d> Acrack, are the "games" just img elements?
[13:17:39] <dawin> hmm Image is not a constructor for mozilla
[13:17:49] <evansykes> does anyone know why api.jquery.com is not loading?
[13:18:05] <Whirl3d> try new image() or new Image()
[13:18:29] <dawin> image is not defined
[13:19:03] <Whirl3d> did you try both capitalizations?
[13:19:13] <dawin> got it
[13:19:18] <systemfault> dawin: Don't use those old crap constructor...
[13:19:25] <dawin> Image = new Image() was the problem
[13:19:27] <systemfault> dawin: document.createElement is universal
[13:19:46] <dawin> x.x
[13:19:54] <Whirl3d> systemfault, you rock. dawin, do whatever systemfault says.
[13:20:08] <dawin> :S
[13:20:09] <systemfault> var image = document.createElement('img'); var div = document.createElement('div'); … etc
[13:20:19] <dawin> i see
[13:20:22] <dawin> thanks
[13:20:37] <systemfault> Why don't you use jQuery though?
[13:20:57] <dawin> i use jq
[13:21:04] <Whirl3d> I told him how I did preloading images. It was part of a bigger discussion
[13:21:09] <systemfault> Ahhh
[13:21:27] <dawin> whirl posted that as a workaround for ie's problem with .load handler
[13:21:39] <dawin> thanks you guys
[13:21:43] <dawin> this irc is really really
[13:21:45] <dawin> helpfull!
[13:21:50] <systemfault> Yeah.. IE doesn't fire .load sometimes :(
[13:22:01] <Whirl3d> I have had problems getting the load handler to work correctly with var img=$("<img/>",.....
[13:22:11] <Whirl3d> nvm, you just said it
[13:22:15] <systemfault> Whirl3d: You set the src after, right?
[13:22:24] <Whirl3d> after the load handler, sure
[13:22:29] <dawin> to bad i cant even test it at ie xD
[13:22:36] <systemfault> Whirl3d: Weird :/
[13:22:57] <systemfault> Anyway, Whirl3d's workaround works :)
[13:23:40] <evansykes> Anyone else having access problems to api.jquery.com?
[13:23:45] <Whirl3d> but I use javascript to create the dom element, then assign the load handler  in jquery and then after assigning the src, I check to see if the dom element is loaded, not the jquery object..if it is, I fire the jquery load method manually
[13:24:14] <Whirl3d> hey are dilligently working on improving the api, forums (sort of) and plugins. It may be a little spotty, but they are doing their best. Give it a couple of minutes and try it again.
[13:24:15] <systemfault> evansykes: Yeah, it's dead.
[13:24:25] <evansykes> Ok. Just making sure.
[13:24:40] <Whirl3d> bot-t is on a bender again...
[13:24:45] <systemfault> evansykes: http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:http://api.jquery.com/ :/ (it sucks… but heh...)
[13:25:48] <evansykes> systemfault: Thanks that works for the meantime.
[13:33:01] <someprimetime> yo Whirl3d
[13:33:11] <someprimetime> can i get your feedback on a slideshow i'm trying to write?
[13:33:24] <biberao> any good jquery book?
[13:35:57] <evansykes> biberao: I am using the jQuery Novice to Ninja book. Check out sitepoint.com I think they just released a new version.
[13:36:09] <biberao> ya 2nd version
[13:36:16] <dawin> humm
[13:36:17] <biberao> what about javascript book?
[13:36:37] <dawin> Whirl3d do i miss something here? http://jsbin.com/ajopuw/ maybe you can check this please
[13:37:15] <evansykes> biberao: Not sure. Just beginning to learn jQuery.
[13:37:28] <biberao> you dont know javascript?
[13:37:51] <Whirl3d> sorry, gimme a sec to catchup. I was reading about the supermoon
[13:38:05] <Whirl3d> someprimetime, gladly.
[13:38:16] <dawin> sry to bother you :)

[13:38:58] <someprimetime> Whirl3d: it's still kind of in its infancy but i was wondering if you had any tips for general construction.. http://jsfiddle.net/someprimetime/4NzfC/37/ click on all of the tabs (but not the first one)
[13:39:23] <biberao> here its 21:39
[13:39:26] <someprimetime> forget the data-slider-panel i'm getting rid of that
[13:39:33] <Whirl3d> dawin, you should checkout jsfiddle. It's a great sandbox that is really easier to help with.
[13:39:58] <dawin> kay i know that one too
[13:40:08] <dawin> this has realtime preview so i use this normaly
[13:40:12] <dawin> but np i can setup this there too
[13:40:48] <Whirl3d> dawin, you wan to setup your scripts in the head element of your document.
[13:41:08] <biberao> 'damn i missed the full moon :|
[13:41:16] <biberao> it was 2 hours ago :||
[13:41:49] <rodd> what's up with the moon/
[13:42:04] <Whirl3d> dawin, you have image=document.....but then you wrap jquery around Image (caps issues)
[13:42:23] <luxpaparazzi> hello, is it possible accessing $this from an outer-function: $(this).click(function () {
[13:42:23] <luxpaparazzi>   jQuery.get(ajaxpath, function(data) {

[13:42:36] <gf3> ?p@ luxpaparazzi
[13:42:37] <dawin> err just saw it x.x
[13:42:38] <Whirl3d> Still, it's gotta look huge for a while. The biggest it's been since 1912
[13:42:39] <bot-t> luxpaparazzi, .text() - Get the combined text contents of each element in the set of matched elements, including their descendants. http://api.jquery.com/text/
[13:42:44] <gf3> ?paste @ luxpaparazzi
[13:42:44] <bot-t> luxpaparazzi, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[13:42:55] <rodd> it's still day here, gonna watch out and leave my camera ready then
[13:42:55] <biberao> who advises me a javascript book?
[13:43:28] <dawin> thx again Whirl3d
[13:43:52] <Whirl3d> sure. are you trying to load multiple images?
[13:44:11] * biberao cries
[13:44:12] <xec> biberao: http://eloquentjavascript.net/
[13:44:20] <biberao> oki thx
[13:44:28] <biberao> brb
[13:44:29] <dawin> the array consists but i load 1 per time
[13:44:57] <dawin> and this is a big array so i dont like to preload them all
[13:45:09] <dawin> maybe i will make a preload currentindex +1
[13:45:23] <dawin> or 2-3
[13:45:31] <Whirl3d> dawin, cache your url
[13:45:59] <dawin> well the server runs pagespeed mod enabled on apache if you mean this?
[13:46:18] <Whirl3d> rather than use the Images[currentIndex].images_url, you could put  var url=images[currne.....
[13:46:18] <xec> luxpaparazzi: if i understand you correctly, you want to access $(this) from a callback? if so just cache it, var $this = $(this); in the outer function and use $this in the inner one
[13:46:38] <Whirl3d> and then in both your loadHanderfunc, just refer to url and attr(src, url)
[13:46:52] <dawin> i see
[13:47:13] <Whirl3d> it saves a little time not having to relookup the value from the object and makes sure that you haven't incremented int he index somewhere so you end up with the wrong url
[13:47:19] <luxpaparazzi> xec thanks have to try that ...
[13:47:47] <biberao> back
[13:47:58] <Whirl3d> that was a quick read
[13:48:08] <xec> i was about to say :)
[13:48:41] <Whirl3d> someprimetime, I'm sorry I got sidetracked with the moon and all. Looking now.
[13:48:49] <someprimetime> hah no worries brb in a few
[13:50:01] <luxpaparazzi> gf3, how do i get posted code from http://jsfiddle.net/ to irc?
[13:50:24] <gf3> luxpaparazzi: You copy the URL, then you paste the URL in here
[13:51:24] <luxpaparazzi> xec, it actually works, thx ...
[13:51:51] <luxpaparazzi> gf3, i did not see the "save" button, thx ^ ^
[13:55:51] <Mekzholan> Hi, is there a way to change the value in a CSS class, i.e. not the DOM elements but the class definition in the stylesheet itself?
[13:56:39] <systemfault> What is "the value"?
[13:57:04] <xec> some rule, i assume?
[13:57:23] <systemfault> That's the problem…. we shouldn't have to assume.
[13:58:12] <Mekzholan> yes, it's one of the values, e.g. "width"
[13:58:33] <Mekzholan> so please replace "the" with "a"
[13:58:35] <xec> well, i find the question relatively clear, he wants to change a style definition from a stylesheet rather than on the element
[13:58:58] <Mekzholan> xec: yup, that's what I wand to do :)
[13:59:14] <Mekzholan> Firefox et al are allowing me to do that...
[13:59:17] <systemfault> Mekzholan: It's somewhat possible but is usually a PITA because the way changes depending on the browser.
[13:59:46] <systemfault> Mekzholan: Could you tell me why you want to do that?
[14:00:05] <Mekzholan> systemfault: ok, did I understand that correctly: it's not possible in a portable way?
[14:00:16] <ShaunBaker> what would be the need to change something in the css but not the dom els
[14:00:25] <systemfault> Mekzholan: Yeah… not without some sort of plugins that normalize the differences.
[14:00:34] <Mekzholan> well, I'm using that class in lots of places and don't want to clutter the DOM
[14:01:17] <xec> Mekzholan: why don't you just change class names and create additional css declarations?
[14:01:26] <brentmulligan> is it just me or has api.jquery.com been down the last few hours?
[14:02:02] <ShaunBaker> yep its down for me, jqapi.com is an alternative
[14:02:12] <Mekzholan> systemfault: it would be fine for me if jQ would handle the differences. But if it can't by default probably I'll try something differently. I thought it's easy and I didn't find the obvious
[14:02:21] <brentmulligan> cool, thanks.
[14:03:11] <Mekzholan> xec: I'm changeing the width. So in this case I'd need lots of dummy class definitions...
[14:03:45] <xec> Mekzholan: you mean animating?
[14:03:45] <systemfault> Mekzholan: Why don't you change the width inline then? (I disconnected, I probably missed something)
[14:04:10] <ShaunBaker> Mekzholan: to affect one element or multiple?
[14:05:23] <Mekzholan> xec: not an animation, but it's a long living page where it might hapen a few times over it's live
[14:06:25] <xec> like systemfault says, why don't you want to do it on the element itself?
[14:06:34] <Mekzholan> systemfault: I have many elements using this class and all should be changes. Inline style would work in this case (i.e. I'm not using the cascading effect) but it would clutter the DOM
[14:06:47] <Mekzholan> ShaunBaker: multiple
[14:07:37] <systemfault> Mekzholan: If you really don't want to modify all elements, perhaps you could do it by hacking a "<style>" tag … but I never tried it.
[14:08:11] <xec> i don't see a good reason to "avoid cluttering the DOM" to be honest, unless you are animating a lot of elements simultaneously
[14:08:33] <Mekzholan> systemfault: good idea! I think that should work!
[14:08:36] <systemfault> xec: Same for me… but he might have thousands of elements.. I don't know
[14:08:52] <xec> the DOM isn't something the user sees, and it's not the same as cluttering the html
[14:09:29] <ShaunBaker> either, set a new class in css with the new width and add this class, or just use .css. either makes sense
[14:10:50] <systemfault> Mekzholan: seems to work for me, I just did a small test
[14:11:08] <systemfault> var style = $('<style />'); $('head').append(style); style.html('img { height: 500px !important; }'); :P
[14:11:21] <Mekzholan> My "page" consists out of a whole tree of pages that are dynamically shown and scrolled to - and each subpage consists out of widgets that are themself nested divs. All of that has to run smooth on mobile devices as well...
[14:11:31] <xec> systemfault: can you access that definition later on?
[14:11:49] <Mekzholan> so I prefer to keep it as simple as possible for the browser
[14:12:00] <xec> or would you just overwrite the style element
[14:12:05] <systemfault> xec: I guess you could attach an id to it so you can refer to it on demand
[14:12:18] <systemfault> Then just .html() it
[14:12:21] <xec> yeah
[14:12:25] <xec> that would work
[14:12:48] <systemfault> You could keep a state in some javascript object then create a function: toStylesheet :P
[14:13:00] <systemfault> Anyway… it seems hackish to me :P
[14:13:33] <systemfault> But that would  probably be a efficient way to do some things
[14:14:12] <nicolasp> Not sure if I am in the right channel for help guys from #jquery-dev pointed me over here, but my Nivo Slider isn't functioning properly anymore, not quite sure why it just stopped.  http://www.notsofastfoodtruck.com/test any help would be greatly appreciated.
[14:17:06] <systemfault> xec: Haha, look at that hack
[14:17:08] <systemfault> var style = $('<style />'); $('head').append(style); var height = 0; setTimeout(function test() { style.html('img { height: ' + height + 'px !important; }'); ++height; if (height < 100) {setTimeout(test, 1);} }, 1);
[14:17:48] <systemfault> It "animates" the height of all the images on the page from 0 to 100 without doing anything to individual images
[14:17:53] <unpaidbi1l> anyone know when api.jquery.com is coming back up? is there a mirror anywhere?
[14:18:10] <shoky> nicolasp: you're using jquery before including it
[14:18:20] <ShaunBaker> jqapi.com has documentation
[14:18:26] <shoky> nicolasp: check your console error logs
[14:18:28] <unpaidbi1l> thanks
[14:18:52] <xec> systemfault: hehe nice
[14:19:11] <xec> systemfault: +10 street creds
[14:23:01] <nicolasp> shoky: so this theme template page is calling the slider before even loading the script
[14:24:36] <shoky> nicolasp: perhaps
[14:28:14] <Freemind> shoky, hi
[14:28:39] <nicolasp> well that didn't work :(
[14:37:48] <shoky> :(
[14:43:49] <knowtheory> dunno if i'm the first to drop by but… anyone else notice the api.jquery.com outage?
[14:44:22] <knowtheory> ah. yes, checking the twitter feed, lots of @jquery comments about it.
[14:44:47] <knowtheory> who does one bother about such matters?
[15:03:13] <_studio> hi, i'm wanting to submit a post form from inside a colorbox (content from another page) and then close the colorbox. i have a click function on the submit button of the form, so i'm doing $(this).parents('form').submit(); but that redirects to a blank page,is hte only way to do this with .get / .post?
[15:09:33] <shoky> knowtheory: appropriate people have been bothered
[15:09:46] <knowtheory> shoky: thanks :)
[15:13:12] <mikeric> how would i get all children of a certain element, but still include that certain element in the results?
[15:14:19] <mikeric> for example $('*', '#context') get's all the child elements, but the #context element is not included in those results.
[15:15:40] <acconrad> Quick question: if I start my file with "(function($) {
[15:15:40] <acconrad>   $(function() {
[15:15:45] <acconrad> is that redundant?
[15:16:10] <systemfault> mikalv: $('#context *, #context') ?
[15:16:42] <systemfault> acconrad: No, they do different things
[15:17:03] <systemfault> acconrad: The first one is an application of the classic "module pattern"
[15:17:27] <systemfault> acconrad: The second one, is a shorthand for $(document).ready(function() {});
[15:18:28] <acconrad> systemfault: okay great, I just wanted to make sure I was implementing this correctly, thanks!
[15:35:01] <rodd> is api server down?
[15:36:19] <xec> apparently
[15:36:23] <xec> try jqapi.com
[15:36:52] <xec> rodd ^
[15:37:07] <rodd> thanks xec
[15:51:42] <_studio> when will api be back up?
[15:55:10] <helpmeguys> hello all
[15:55:28] <helpmeguys> anyone know of an alternative to .click?
[15:55:43] <helpmeguys> i want a function to loop on load
[15:56:09] <systemfault> helpmeguys: More info please?
[15:56:25] <helpmeguys> $('.box').click(function() {     $('.box').each(function() {         if ($(this).offset().left < 0) {             $(this).css("left", "150%");         } else if ($(this).offset().left > $('#container').width()) {             $(this).animate({                 left: '50%',             }, 500 );         } else {             $(this).animate({                 left: '-150%',             }, 500 );         }     }); });​
[15:56:27] <helpmeguys> eh that doesn't work
[15:56:32] <xec> ?p
[15:56:32] <helpmeguys> http://jsfiddle.net/jtbowden/ykbgT/light/
[15:56:32] <bot-t> Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[15:56:48] <helpmeguys> i want this to occur onload
[15:56:52] <helpmeguys> and onhover i want it to pause
[15:57:11] <systemfault> helpmeguys: $(function() {  all your code here }); should be enough
[15:57:15] <helpmeguys> i want to replace .click with a command that makes it occur except when the mouse in hovered over
[15:59:43] <helpmeguys> that doesn't give me any result
[16:01:54] <Parhs> omg that sucks... http://www.newsit.gr/default.php?pname=Article&art_id=137886&catid=3 (irrilevant )
[16:03:02] <Parhs> helpmeguys what do you want exactly?
[16:03:24] <Parhs> you can stop it onhover
[16:03:46] <helpmeguys> I want the divs to slide on and off screen onload
[16:03:51] <helpmeguys> and pause onhover
[16:07:07] <Parhs> hm .stop() maybe ?
[16:07:56] <Parhs> also this hurts performance ,what are you trying to do ?
[16:10:50] <xec> helpmeguys: there are about a thousand slider plugins out there, surely there's something decent out there that lets you pause it on hover
[16:11:25] <helpmeguys> just want to slide some images on and off screen
[16:11:27] <helpmeguys> and pause on hover
[16:13:46] <Bhavic> Hey guys, you can put javascript into any part of the document right? Ie it doesnt have to be in just the head?
[16:14:07] <xec> correct
[16:14:25] <Bhavic> Great thanks
[16:15:03] <xec> for best performance you might want to put them all at the end of your <body>
[16:15:26] <Bhavic> Ah sweet
[16:18:15] <Whirl3d> helpmeguys, is it important that the element pause sliding at the time that you hover, or just that it prohibits the sliing off of the image if you are hovering?
[16:18:57] <helpmeguys> just that it prohibits the next image from sliding in until mouseout
[16:19:18] <Whirl3d> do you want any delay between the two events?
[16:19:20] <helpmeguys> it's also that i find a way to replace .click function with something that causes the loop to initiate onpageload
[16:19:27] <helpmeguys> no
[16:20:43] <Whirl3d> helpmeguys, here's the deal: you need to write some code and post it to jsfiddle and we can advise you from there. There is no way for us to divine all of the special circumstances that are required for your script.
[16:21:23] <xec> he actually did http://jsfiddle.net/jtbowden/ykbgT/light/
[16:21:27] <helpmeguys> whirl3d:http://jsfiddle.net/ykbgT/1892/
[16:21:44] <Whirl3d> xec, if you are on it, than it must be difficult
[16:21:47] <xec> i made this http://jsfiddle.net/ykbgT/1893/
[16:22:03] <xec> i call it "sliderlol"
[16:22:10] <xec> i find the name descriptive
[16:23:07] <Whirl3d> fully. That's why I asked about the delay. The way you did it(with the short delay) works best, imho
[16:23:38] <helpmeguys> thanks all
[16:23:56] <Whirl3d> helpmeguys, gimme just a minute and Ill work one up for ya too.
[16:24:12] <helpmeguys> whirld3d ok
[16:24:28] <xec> it's a lot more fun if you decrease the timer http://jsfiddle.net/ykbgT/1894/
[16:24:52] <xec> makes the codes logic really shine :D
[16:25:30] <Whirl3d> helpmeguys....walk me through the very first step....you have a div with an image element (unloaded) off screen and you want to load the image, slide it in and start loading another image. When the other image is loaded, swap the two and load another image, correct?
[16:26:16] <Whirl3d> of course, stopping the swapping if hovered.
[16:26:17] <helpmeguys> on load first image slides in, after delay, next image slides in as original image slides off screen, this process is continued infinately except onhover at which point animation pauses
[16:26:23] <helpmeguys> yes
[16:28:02] <Whirl3d> any reason we are using jquery 1.4/4?
[16:28:11] <xec> oldskool!
[16:28:48] <xec> my guess (seeing the number of updates on this fiddle) it's not actually helpmeguys' script
[16:29:11] <xec> some tutorial or popular forum answer somewhere, perhaps?
[16:31:32] <christo_m> hello, im trying to use Andy Matthews' Autocomplete plugin http://www.andymatthews.net/code/autocomplete/
[16:31:37] <christo_m> However id like to override the "?term=" to be "?q=" .. i googled around and found fixes like this: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3133510/how-to-change-jquery-autocomplete-plugin-default-querystring-key-term-to-that
[16:31:42] <christo_m> These solutions of dealing with the server myself ended up giving me really malformed urls
[16:32:13] <christo_m> source: function(request, response) {
[16:32:13] <christo_m>     $.getJSON("url", { foo: request.term }, response);
[16:32:13] <christo_m>   }
[16:32:17] <christo_m> woops, sry
[16:33:44] <xec> christo_m: that snippet you posted seems to be where the "term" comes from, can't you just change it from request.term to request.q ?
[16:34:31] <christo_m> xec: thats supposed to be the fix lol.
[16:34:39] <christo_m> foo being the replacement
[16:35:11] <xec> right
[16:35:25] <christo_m> by default jquery ui's autocomplete uses ?term.. however if im interfacing with a DB externally.. and they use something else (like the more popular ?q) im stuck.
[16:35:46] <christo_m> anyway, the GET req's that fix gives me look weird, like %20's and stuff
[16:36:46] <xec> %20 is a space in a url
[16:36:57] <christo_m> yes i know
[16:37:08] <xec> so if you do a get with a querystring that shouldn't be weird
[16:38:31] <christo_m> xec:  http://localhost/recipe/function%20(request,%20response)%20%7B%20%20%20%20$.getJSON(%22url%22,%20%7Bfoo:%20request.term%7D,%20response);%7D?term=aa
[16:38:34] <christo_m> even when it looks like that?
[16:38:37] <christo_m> because thats definitely wrong
[16:38:44] <xec> lol
[16:39:07] <xec> i agree, thats definetely wrong :)
[16:39:19] <christo_m> and to top it off it still put ?term at the end..
[16:39:47] <xec> but the andy matthews autocomplete is not the same as jquery ui autocomplete?
[16:39:58] <christo_m> right, its an adaptation for jquery mobile.
[16:40:10] <christo_m> i guess i could try the standard ui plugin.
[16:40:33] <xec> christo_m: what did you change and what did it look like before
[16:41:19] <christo_m> xec: i didnt touch the plugin. all i did was change the source: attribute
[16:41:42] <christo_m> heres what it looks like regularly, with source assuming some action that'll render me results
[16:41:46] <christo_m> sec
[16:41:49] <xec> christo_m: looking at the source for the andy thing now, and it looks to me like you can just change $.get(settings.source, { term: text },..... to $.get(settings.source, { q: text },
[16:42:18] <christo_m> http://localhost/recipe/url?term=a
[16:42:20] <christo_m> hmm
[16:42:52] <xec> "term" is a hardcoded value so you can't change it through settings - unless i'm missing something
[16:43:03] <christo_m> xec: you're right
[16:43:06] <christo_m> changing that fixed it
[16:43:08] <christo_m> thanks dude
[16:43:35] <xec> yw :)
[16:43:38] <christo_m> i need to hack the source more.. its just i had a .min version of it and thats obviously a pain to read, but i should take the time in the future to actually look at the code XD
[16:44:24] <xec> yeah, i find it a great way to learn too, if it's quality code of course
[16:46:22] <imsky> derp
[16:47:01] <christo_m> xec: my god.. http://www.recipepuppy.com/ing.php?q=onion ... im getting the red X in firebug
[16:47:10] <christo_m> but if i hit it in my browser i get the results..
[16:47:58] <Bhavic> Hey, if im doing a ajax(), and result is data, can i get a specific section? Ie something between <h2></h2>
[16:48:18] <Bhavic> but
[16:48:20] <Bhavic> oops*
[16:48:51] <systemfault> use .load instead
[16:50:47] <christo_m> http://www.recipepuppy.com/about/api/ .. even tried using /api/?q=
[16:51:08] <christo_m> i get results when i hit the urls, the jsons staring at me, but when i make the request with autocomplete its failing in firebug
[16:52:02] <xec> doesn't look like json to me
[16:52:50] <xec> is the script at the same domain as the site you're quering
[16:52:56] <xec> is that a word?
[16:53:49] <christo_m> no its not..
[16:53:51] <christo_m> thats why eh
[16:54:02] <muhoo> is there a way to have sub-tabs in jquery ui tabs?
[16:54:40] <christo_m> xec: http://www.recipepuppy.com/api/?q=omelet thats not json to you?
[16:54:44] <xec> christo_m: yeah, you can't make ajax calls cross domain just like that
[16:55:16] <xec> christo_m: yes, that it does, but http://www.recipepuppy.com/ing.php?q=onion did not :P
[16:55:37] <christo_m> xec: so what do i do now.
[16:55:40] <christo_m> hahah
[16:55:50] <christo_m> do i have to manually fetch them from an action or something. then call it
[16:56:44] <xec> christo_m: depends on what's supported by the external site - jsonp is made for this sort of thing
[16:57:13] <xec> christo_m: or you can make your webserver do the http request for you
[16:58:21] <Guest68938> hey guys, i'm trying to select a specific option by its content (<select><option value='1'>CONTENT</option></select>). how do i do that?

[16:59:37] <xec> http://jqapi.com/#p=contains-selector
[17:00:48] <Guest68938> xec: and if i'm looking for exact content, and not that contains it?
[17:01:37] <xec> Guest68938: you could .filter() with a function that compares the .text() i guess
[17:01:47] <Whirl3d> okay, I just did a full faceplant on my keyboard, LOL Maybe day 3 isn't the best day to try to write code)
[17:02:05] <xec> lol Whirl3d, what did you do? :D
[17:02:35] <Whirl3d> leaned forward until my face smacked into my keyboard, startling me awake.
[17:03:13] <xec> ahhh, haha, i thought you did it on purpose in response to some sort of "duh" moment
[17:03:31] <Whirl3d> err, I mean, yeah yeah what xec said...
[17:03:42] <xec> maybe time to get some sleep? :D
[17:03:46] <xec> or coffee
[17:04:15] <a2bc> i use two .dialog() functions for a class-click event. On the first click, the correct dialog is shown. If i click a second time for the other dialog, both dialogs appear. Does anyone know why?
[17:04:59] <shoky> ?paste @ a2bc
[17:04:59] <bot-t> a2bc, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[17:08:35] <a2bc> ahhh found the fault at the time i pasted it. Thanks ^^
[17:21:48] <dawin> hiho
[17:22:14] <dawin> does $('a#toggleNav') selector makes it better then just $('#toggleNav')?
[17:22:48] <lorph_> is /wc
[17:23:07] <dawin> since its a id i guess doesnt make any speed improvement
[17:27:30] <systemfault> dawin: No, it's just slower.
[17:27:43] <systemfault> And less flexible.
[17:31:01] <christo_m> xec: you still there?
[17:31:32] <christo_m> xec: http://pastebin.com/2jeSjLVu  , this is the part im at.. i can successfully get the json data
[17:31:39] <christo_m> but putting the two parts together is proving troublesome
[17:32:25] <dawin> systemfault: thx fault yeah i guess only in a class selector this would make sense no?
[17:32:31] <christo_m> xec: i dont want to hardcode the $.ajax url.. i need to get it from the autocomplete somehow
[17:32:44] <systemfault> dawin: Yeah, it would definitely make more sense :)
[17:33:21] <christo_m> hm i think i got it
[17:35:28] <systemfault> christo_m: If you take a look at the documentation, you can see that source can take a callback.
[17:36:28] <christo_m> systemfault: like writing it like  source: function (request, response) {,, then with the $.ajax in there
[17:36:38] <christo_m> except that results in the malformed urls from earlier
[17:36:39] <systemfault> Yes :D
[17:36:42] <systemfault> Hmm
[17:36:59] <Lyfesaver> hey guys, as I am a JSnewbie.. i have a very newb question. Using a MVC app i have a large model. a for each loop will/can spawn 200+ results. my question is, altho i am sure it is bad practice, is it harmful for each spawned div to have its own js script to handle dialogs? in other words can a website load "too many" tiny jscripts?
[17:37:00] <systemfault> Then you're doing something wrong, it's probably just a small thing :(
[17:38:07] <systemfault> Lyfesaver: Depends… if you have a "group" of similar items, you can often use event delegation, that way, you only have a single event handler for X elements
[17:38:28] <Lyfesaver> ya i hear, i am just not that good =) lol
[17:38:58] <systemfault> If you can, use event delegation or else, it might be very slow on old IE
[17:39:31] <Lyfesaver> kk thanks for the tip =)
[17:39:45] <christo_m> systemfault: http://pastebin.com/5Bw33JNe
[17:39:58] <christo_m> http://localhost/recipe/function%20(request,%20response)%20%7B%20%20%20%20$.ajax(%7Burl:%20%22http://www.recipepuppy.com/api%22,%20dataType:%20%22jsonp%22,%20success:%20function%20()%20%7Bconsole.log(%22success%22);%7D%7D);%7D?q=aa
[17:40:02] <christo_m> results in errors like that.
[17:40:06] <christo_m> i mean GET requests like that.
[17:41:07] <systemfault> christo_m: wtf :/
[17:41:29] <dawin> lets say i create for my images a preloader like that var preImage = document.createElement('img');, does this not stay in the browser "memory","dom",whatever, do i need to kill,remove this?
[17:42:14] <systemfault> dawin: Let the GC do its job :P If the node is not referenced anywhere, it will be collected
[17:42:15] <dawin> it doesnt show up in the html tree of firebug but still
[17:42:47] <dawin> i see so i let the browser do the job ok :D
[17:42:51] <systemfault> dawin: If you want to be sure it's collect, you could assign null to preImage but it shouldn't be necessary
[17:43:07] <christo_m> systemfault: haha what
[17:43:56] <dawin> thx again systemfault :)
[17:43:58] <systemfault> christo_m: You have a weird problem :( You're sure you are using the jquery-ui version?
[17:44:06] <systemfault> dawin: You're welcome.
[17:44:14] <Whirl3d> christo_m isn't that just url_encoded?
[17:44:50] <christo_m> Whirl3d: i dont think so.. my console.log is in there
[17:45:10] <systemfault> Whirl3d: Looks like his autocomplete doesn't understand the callback and simply toString it
[17:45:16] <christo_m> systemfault: its http://www.andymatthews.net/code/autocomplete/
[17:45:26] <christo_m> which is based on autocomplete ui, but its for jquery mobile
[17:45:38] <Whirl3d>  http://localhost/recipe/function (request, response) {    $.ajax({url: "http://www.recipepuppy.com/api", dataType: "jsonp", success: function () {console.log("success");}});}?q=aa
[17:46:02] <Whirl3d> that's the decoded version of your previous post
[17:46:10] <christo_m> right
[17:46:19] <christo_m> and i suspect its what systemfault said
[17:46:34] <christo_m> its literally dumping that as the url then appending the query to it.
[17:46:36] <systemfault> christo_m: It doesn't seem to be jquery-ui autocomplete compatible.
[17:46:50] <christo_m> jquery mobile? or the plugin this guy wrote
[17:46:59] <christo_m> because he has examples on his site.. of course they all assume you arent doing cross domain stuff.
[17:47:24] <systemfault> Heh :(
[17:47:38] <systemfault> That's a bad plugin it seems.
[17:48:12] <systemfault> The problem is that you probably don't want jquery-ui in your project if you use jquery-mobile.
[17:48:35] <systemfault> (Because jquery-ui is a big, monolithic pile of….. <beep>
[17:59:21] <christo_m> systemfault: lol great, now i get Jquery with a bunch of numbers is not defined
[17:59:45] <systemfault> o_)
[17:59:50] <systemfault> o_O
[17:59:58] <christo_m> http://www.recipepuppy.com/api/?callback=jQuery16409170185502293303_1336265945205&_=1336265946905
[18:00:01] <christo_m> does something like this now
[18:00:12] <christo_m> im literlaly copying the code from the jquery ui site, and modifying the url.
[18:00:34] <systemfault> christo_m: But you're not using jquery ui...
[18:00:44] <christo_m> i am now.
[18:00:45] <systemfault> But some kind of autocomplete written by some dude.
[18:00:47] <systemfault> Ahhh
[18:00:48] <christo_m> lol.
[18:00:58] <christo_m> his autocomplete built on top of this or something
[18:02:10] <oojacoboo> if I have a function that I want to execute when the parent function is called, how can I make it auto exectute?
[18:02:10] <christo_m> lol, this poor bastard had the same problem as me
[18:02:12] <christo_m> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10149863/jquery-mobile-autocomplete-using-jsonp
[18:02:19] <oojacoboo> would I just call the function, or is there a better method?
[18:02:48] <Mac_Weber> how to get jCarousel to open in a specific item? I got it working, but when the item is out of the range of preloaded items it keeps loading forever. How to do it?
[18:07:01] <systemfault> christo_m: It seems to work.
[18:07:18] <systemfault> christo_m: What is the problem?
[18:07:30] <CanadaMark> Hi room.
[18:07:42] <systemfault> christo_m: That url is good http://www.recipepuppy.com/api/?callback=jQuery16409170185502293303_1336265945205&_=1336265946905
[18:08:09] <systemfault> christo_m: I guess that because you haven't specified a callback, jquery created one,
[18:08:16] <CanadaMark> Does anyone know the channel or place I can go where I could possibly hire some ondemand jquery dev skills?
[18:08:44] <CanadaMark> Besides the place like fiveer which blocks trading contact info
[18:09:50] <rcsolismx> Hi. I get a very strange error while using jQueryUI Autocomplete widget, anyone has experience with this widget ?
[18:10:00] <oojacoboo> api down :(
[18:10:04] <someprimetime> rcsolismx: just ask the question someone surely has
[18:10:22] <systemfault> oojacoboo: http://jqapi.com/ :/
[18:10:44] <oojacoboo> I like the other one :P
[18:12:01] <christo_m> systemfault: it doesnt return anything
[18:12:23] <systemfault> christo_m: Try to open that url in the browser.
[18:12:28] <rcsolismx> Sorry, Well I use the example code  for custom data and display but the results has inserted in all <ul> of the page
[18:12:29] <christo_m> http://pastebin.com/a0XRYTX3
[18:12:55] <christo_m> systemfault: right, i get the json.
[18:12:59] <christo_m> my queries lost.
[18:13:11] <systemfault> christo_m: How are you supposed to query that API?
[18:13:40] <christo_m> like this: http://www.recipepuppy.com/api/?q=something
[18:13:41] <christo_m> however
[18:14:37] <christo_m> actually nvm ,i dontk now, waters boiling
[18:14:52] <christo_m> systemfault: i have no clue why its telling me somethings not defined, the callbacks right there.
[18:16:03] <systemfault> christo_m: Show me your code again
[18:17:27] <systemfault> christo_m: Try to remove the q: request.term and replace the url with: "http://www.recipepuppy.com/api/?callback=jqueryCallback&q=" request.term
[18:17:34] <christo_m> systemfault: http://pastebin.com/y51wPDfd
[18:17:54] <systemfault> christo_m: Try what I just wrote
[18:18:24] <christo_m> systemfault: i removed the q..
[18:18:31] <christo_m> ah
[18:18:32] <christo_m> one sec
[18:19:06] <christo_m> systemfault: im assuming you mean + request.term?
[18:19:10] <christo_m> systemfault: same problem
[18:20:03] <systemfault> christo_m: 2 seconds.
[18:21:23] <systemfault> christo_m: I'll be back in 5 minutes… would be nice if you could write an example on jsfiddle :(
[18:21:32] <christo_m> systemfault: sure
[18:21:35] <christo_m> ill try, never used it before
[18:21:36] <systemfault> christo_m: That way, we could help each other
[18:22:23] <rcsolismx> The code I use for show the autocomplete widget is here http://pastebin.com/PAi97uT9 it works fine the unique problem here is that the same results shown into the autocomplete dropdown list was appended into all the other lists of the page (top menu, side menu, submenu and so on) anyone has deal with something similar ?
[18:24:34] <christo_m> systemfault: http://jsfiddle.net/DTyMF/ , did the best i could
[18:24:43] <christo_m> dont think itll be of much help
[18:29:58] <systemfault> Hey
[18:30:06] <christo_m> hey
[18:30:10] <shoky> halu
[18:31:00] <systemfault> christo_m: Give me 5 minutes
[18:31:19] <christo_m> systemfault: thats 10 minutes now!!
[18:31:22] <christo_m> :P
[18:31:25] <systemfault> :(
[18:35:39] <rcsolismx> :(
[18:35:48] <christo_m> its depressing in here
[18:35:49] <christo_m> cut it out
[18:35:52] <Bhavic> Hey guys, if i have datepicker({ maxDate: "+1w" });, How do i add in a minDate
[18:36:04] <Bhavic> with a comma inside the {} ?
[18:36:35] <christo_m> lol..
[18:36:35] <christo_m> yes
[18:36:49] <Bhavic> thanks
[18:37:55] <shoky> ?js hi5('shoky','christo_m')
[18:37:59] <bot-t> shoky: "shoky _o/\o_ christo_m"
[18:38:25] <systemfault> christo_m: I'm close :/
[18:38:45] <christo_m> haha
[18:43:46] <systemfault> christo_m: I don't understand.. it does the call.. but the api is doing something really weird.
[18:44:47] <christo_m> ikr
[18:46:03] <christo_m> systemfault: im not sure what i should be doing
[18:46:09] <christo_m> looking for a new plugin? or trying to figure this out.
[18:46:27] <systemfault> christo_m: Hmm, two seconds, I'll send you a link of what I'm playing with
[18:49:04] <systemfault> christo_m: http://jsfiddle.net/DTyMF/1/
[18:51:10] <christo_m> systemfault: so it doesnt even get to the done
[18:51:12] <christo_m> it doesnt even call it
[18:51:24] <christo_m> systemfault: what are you using to debug?
[18:51:30] <christo_m> just firebug?
[18:51:33] <systemfault> christo_m: Nope, but if you enable the login in the console, you see some weird error
[18:51:37] <systemfault> No, the chrome dev tools
[18:51:44] <systemfault> With xhr logging enabled
[18:52:33] <species> hey
[18:53:09] <species> im sending an ajax request to get a json file (foo.json) and in my success method, I do alert(data) but it tells me the object already has type json. Why is this? at what point is the file being parsed into an object?
[18:53:59] <species> erm
[18:54:18] <species> i mean in the alert, it says [object Object]
[18:54:33] <christo_m> systemfault: im getting uncaught syntax error about a colon in the json array
[18:55:07] <christo_m> systemfault: apparently www.recipepuppy.com is part of the scripts?
[18:55:09] <systemfault> species: That's the whole idea… what is the purpose or json if it's not to create an object from it?
[18:55:10] <shoky> species: if you're using json datatype then jquery does the parsing for you
[18:55:11] <christo_m> under resources
[18:55:24] <systemfault> christo_m: Yeah...
[18:55:52] <species> also
[18:55:55] <species> jquery site is down
[18:56:00] <shoky> yes
[18:56:06] <christo_m> systemfault: uhh, am i missing something here
[18:56:08] <shoky> google cache isnt
[18:56:09] <christo_m> the hells gonig on
[18:56:12] <species> dunno
[18:56:13] <species> http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[18:56:20] <species> oops, wrong link
[18:56:31] <systemfault> christo_m: It's okay, I got it...
[18:56:45] <systemfault> christo_m: Give me 2-3 minutes to format it.
[18:57:04] <species> ffs chrome
[18:58:24] <species> is there a more direct way of dealing with json data than an ajax request?
[18:58:40] <shoky> whatcha mean
[18:59:21] <shoky> you can use text datatype and do whatever you want with the text
[19:00:23] <species> im not actually setting a datatype
[19:00:29] <species> maybe thats the problem?
[19:00:54] <species> yeah, i want text, because im not going to parse it right away, im going to hash it and do a security check first
[19:00:59] <shoky> the default is to let jquery guess, and it'll guess json
[19:01:05] <species> ahh
[19:03:17] <systemfault> christo_m: http://jsfiddle.net/DTyMF/5/
[19:04:02] <systemfault> christo_m: Just play with the label/value… but it should be that.
[19:05:17] <christo_m> systemfault: dudeee thanks
[19:05:23] <systemfault> :)
[19:05:34] <christo_m> you had to manually concatenate that it was json callback
[19:05:35] <christo_m> in the url
[19:05:55] <systemfault> christo_m: I know.. It's weird that I had to do that..
[19:06:06] <nanotechnoloG> wow that's sweet
[19:06:08] <systemfault> christo_m: But I had errors with the default callback
[19:06:57] <christo_m> systemfault: thank you though, i really appreciate it
[19:07:05] <christo_m> i think ive spent 2 hours or so on this autocomplete bs
[19:07:11] <systemfault> christo_m: :P
[19:07:13] <nanotechnoloG> oh man
[19:07:36] <nanotechnoloG> been fighting w/ populating a dropdown w/ a json response
[19:07:43] <systemfault> :P
[19:16:03] <species> i cant find a list of values acceptable in an ajax query object data type
[19:16:11] <species> i just want text back
[19:16:14] <species> no parsing
[19:17:24] <species> oops, found it
[19:24:43] <Wilornel> Guys, why isnt this working? http://jsfiddle.net/L6Vb9/
[19:24:52] <Wilornel> I mean the console.log gives something like:
[19:25:01] <Wilornel> function ( value ) { 		return jQuery.access( this, function( value ) { 			return value === undefined ? 				jQuery.text( this ) :
[19:30:21] <Ret12> Wilornel: You missed the "()" in what should be "$(this).text()"
[19:31:07] <Wilornel> Oh
[19:31:10] <Wilornel> thanks
[19:37:27] <Lyfesaver> how do i tell a function call that the name is varible
[19:37:36] <Lyfesaver> for instance starting it off with
[19:37:38] <Lyfesaver> $( infoId ).dialog({
[19:37:49] <Lyfesaver> where infoId is a varible
[19:37:59] <Lyfesaver> cuz what i have there does not work
[19:38:02] <Lyfesaver> lol
[19:39:44] <Lyfesaver> nvm got it

[19:47:44] <Hexasquid> Many thanks
[19:50:24] <pl0sh> Hey guys, I have an issue, I am using a $.post() call to set a value in the backend's database, however, if I do a $.post() call in the firebug's console it actually modifies the value, so, I would like to avoid the user to manually set the value using firebug's console.. is there anyway to temporary encrypt/encode the value?
[19:51:06] <gf3> pl0sh: Welcome to the client-side
[19:51:27] <pl0sh> gf3: Thanks, any idea?
[19:51:28] <gf3> pl0sh: All your limits and validations should be imposed server-side
[19:51:38] <systemfault> How many sides there are ? :(
[19:51:46] <systemfault> Light.. Dark.. Server… Client… ?
[19:52:03] <pl0sh> yeah, the problem is that the calculation is done at the client-side
[19:52:56] <gf3> pl0sh: Does it really matter, or are you over engineering it?
[19:53:11] <pl0sh> we're currently developing the version 2 of the client-side app, however, I need to temporarily fix it as is..
[19:53:39] <pl0sh> gf3: yes, it matters, because the app is a game where the users get benefits by acumulating points
[19:54:07] <pl0sh> so, someone with little knowledge of js/jquery could use firebug to manually set him a high value
[19:56:54] <gf3> pl0sh: I don't think you can truly prevent it, only make it inconvenient
[19:57:36] <pl0sh> well, what I know is that the points never are more than 3 digits, as a last resort, I plan to validate if value is greater than 100
[19:57:37] <pl0sh> lol
[19:58:19] <gf3> I guess you could do some basic hashing, but again, it's only an inconvenience
[19:58:40] <Hexasquid> Errr does the client tell the server what the current score is, or does it tell the server when a new point is scored?
[19:59:16] <Hexasquid> Interesting problem
[19:59:24] <pl0sh> Hexasquid: the client sends the actual score
[20:00:05] <Hexasquid> Right so what if it just told the server 'hey add one hundred points' and the server replied 'yeak ok now they have 350 points'
[20:00:38] <gf3> Hexasquid: Same issue, non?
[20:00:46] <Hexasquid> Hmm I gues then the problem shift to stopping the user from doing that first one
[20:00:48] <pl0sh> well, I though it that way too, but if the user manually sends a high value it is the same issue
[20:01:18] <josemtzm> I'm newbie
[20:01:28] <josemtzm> What the hwck is jQuery??

[20:03:09] <systemfault> gf3: That would be gayQueery
[20:03:12] <pl0sh> a place to get laid with sexy girls, but you need to speak in code..
[20:03:31] <pl0sh> the more encoded is your talking the sexier girl you get :)
[20:03:36] <gf3> systemfault, Hexasquid: Same thing, non?

[20:04:11] <systemfault> Boobs, not moobs.
[20:04:13] <systemfault> :/
[20:04:22] <pl0sh> so, solution is to redo the game, right? :d
[20:04:29] <gf3> pl0sh: No
[20:04:44] <systemfault> josemtzm: Is that a serious question?
[20:04:46] <gf3> pl0sh: Just kinda unavoidable on the client-side
[20:05:04] <pl0sh> gf3: I tried to validate something as the referer at the server-side
[20:05:19] <pl0sh> user-agent, and some other stuff
[20:05:23] <pl0sh> but no luck
[20:05:31] <raj> why is api.jquery.com down?
[20:05:35] <Hexasquid> Well it would be that same browser right?
[20:05:43] <pl0sh> exactly.
[20:05:49] <systemfault> raj: jresig took too much beer :/
[20:05:50] <gf3> pl0sh: You could do some basic hashing
[20:05:59] <Hexasquid> http://dochub.io/#jquery
[20:06:17] <pl0sh> gf3:  that's what I though actually
[20:06:41] <pl0sh> hmm guys I gotta go
[20:07:04] <pl0sh> I'll come back tomorrow whether with a solution or still bugging you with questions lol
[20:07:08] <pl0sh> thanks btw..
[20:07:44] <josemtzm> yes my question is very seroius systemfault
[20:07:51] <josemtzm> serious*
[20:08:18] <systemfault> josemtzm: Ok… Do you know what javascript is? :/
[20:08:30] <josemtzm> I'm new to IRC too
[20:08:49] <josemtzm> yes i know javascript
[20:10:00] <systemfault> josemtzm: Ok, so jQuery is just a library with functions that makes it easier to manipulate the content of your webpages… It also has workarounds to correct browser idiosyncracies.
[20:10:20] <systemfault> *asies
[20:12:12] <PhonicUK> hey everyone
[20:12:14] <josemtzm> Ok, I get it. It's free??? Where can I find it??? It works with .NET???
[20:12:23] <PhonicUK> anyone about who has been following my IDE project?
[20:12:43] <PhonicUK> I've just posted a new video of its development: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4mhmeCLoFU&feature=youtu.be
[20:15:17] <PhonicUK> for anyone who isn't aware of it yet, its a web-based IDE for building web apps heavily built around jquery and jquery-ui
[20:15:27] <PhonicUK> combined with a framework to glue everything together neatly
[20:15:56] <oojacoboo> how do you .load() over an entire element where you don't have a direct descendent?
[20:16:10] <oojacoboo> do I need to load() to a var and use html() ?
[20:16:21] <Hexasquid> You can find it at http://jquery.com/
[20:17:15] <raj> is .parents() the correct method to use if I want to get to the parent of an element with the class .myclass ? There's only 1
[20:17:26] <raj> there's only 1 parent with that class
[20:17:36] <s25g5d4> is api.jquery.com down?
[20:17:41] <raj> s25g5d4, yes
[20:17:47] <raj> use google's cached copy
[20:17:50] <josemtzm> Thanks for the link, I'll google it for more info and I'll come back with punctual questions
[20:18:37] <devOlsen> this link work for anyone else? http://api.­jquery.­com/­animate/­
[20:18:38] <oojacoboo> raj use closest
[20:18:41] <raj> i remember coming across something other than .parents()
[20:19:04] <s25g5d4> what's wrong with that site?
[20:19:15] <raj> oojacoboo, cool, is that faster or something?
[20:19:15] <devOlsen> I'm not able to pull it up right now.
[20:19:18] <oojacoboo> s25g5d4: it's down duh
[20:19:40] <oojacoboo> raj: unless you're looking for the direct parent of that element, not sure about speed
[20:19:40] <devOlsen> oh noes, the animate api is down, the world is going to end! lol
[20:19:48] <s25g5d4> i know. does any one know why?
[20:20:08] <oojacoboo> raj: you have .parent() as well
[20:20:32] <raj> it's a few divs up
[20:20:53] <raj> just wondering why you suggested closest over parents
[20:21:17] <oojacoboo> for taht reason
[20:21:35] <oojacoboo> closest will go up the dom until it find the parent you want
[20:24:32] <christo_m> systemfault: you still there?
[20:24:44] <christo_m> any thing else i can use besidse decodeURI to get rid of that %20 crap
[20:28:03] <raj> how can i append something after the selector?
[20:28:14] <raj> .append is appending it within
[20:29:00] <raj> .after?
[20:34:56] <oojacoboo> after should work no?
[20:40:02] <raj> oojacoboo, yep, that works just fine :)
[20:40:42] <raj> if I addClass('myclass') to an element multiple times, will that element actually have that class multiple times?
[20:41:17] <oojacoboo> it shouldn't, no
[20:42:06] <oojacoboo> raj: you could always use hasClass() though to check ;)
[20:43:56] <raj> true, just didn't know if I needed to :)
[20:44:01] <christo_m> what the hell, i have a request.term.. my search terms
[20:44:16] <christo_m> i do unescape(), decodeURI, nothing gets rid of the %20, i cant even regexp them with replace
[20:44:24] <christo_m> i can replace the commas, but not the spaces..
[20:44:47] <oojacoboo> christo_m: serialize()
[20:47:02] <christo_m> oojacoboo: url: "http://www.recipepuppy.com/api/?i=" + $(request.term).serialize(),  ??
[20:47:10] <christo_m> i cant even see the GET requests in firebug
[20:47:12] <christo_m> pissin me off
[20:47:47] <oojacoboo> chris_n: what's request.term?
[20:48:25] <coldhead> christo_m: did you try right clicking on the console and enabling 'log xhr requests'?
[20:48:48] <oojacoboo> why not just something like $.post($('form#my-form').serialize(), function() {});
[20:49:10] <oojacoboo> sorry, url is first param
[20:49:12] <oojacoboo> post url
[20:49:28] <christo_m> coldhead: yes
[20:49:34] <christo_m> post url?
[20:50:01] <oojacoboo> do you need GET?
[20:50:27] <christo_m> actually im almost certain serialize isnt what i want..
[20:50:40] <oojacoboo> wtf are you trying to do ;)
[20:50:46] <systemfault> christo_m: What do you want to do?
[20:51:21] <christo_m> systemfault: just strip out the %20s
[20:51:29] <systemfault> strip them from what?
[20:51:33] <christo_m> "NetworkError: 500 Internal Server Error - http://www.recipepuppy.com/api/?i=cheese%2C%20carrots%2C%20pepper%2C%20&callback=query&_=1336276265209"
[20:51:36] <christo_m> from request.term
[20:51:42] <christo_m> i tried using unescape and decodeURI
[20:51:44] <oojacoboo> chris_n: back up
[20:51:48] <oojacoboo> what are you trying to do?
[20:51:54] <oojacoboo> christo_m:
[20:51:55] <christo_m> ..strip the %20s!
[20:51:58] <oojacoboo> no
[20:52:07] <devinceartas> But if you are using it to compose a URL, you wanturl encoding, right?
[20:52:15] <christo_m> well, replace them with +
[20:52:21] <oojacoboo> chris_n: what's the ultimate goal?
[20:52:25] <devinceartas> Why
[20:52:33] <oojacoboo> christo_m: **
[20:52:42] <systemfault> christo_m: The %20 are not the problem…
[20:52:53] <systemfault> christo_m: It's those %2C
[20:53:14] <oojacoboo> it sounds like to me he's trying to solve an issue that doesn't need solving
[20:53:28] <christo_m> systemfault: no.
[20:53:30] <christo_m> "NetworkError: 500 Internal Server Error - http://www.recipepuppy.com/api/?i=cheese,%20carrots,%20peppers%20&callback=query&_=1336276397243"
[20:53:33] <christo_m> ?i=che...6397243
[20:53:34] <bot-t> christo_m, Couldn't find "i=che...6397243" in jQuery Docs.
[20:53:54] <christo_m> i did a search on the actual site, the put %2C, and use + for spaces.
[20:54:01] <christo_m> so im trying to adhere to that format
[20:54:20] <oojacoboo> christo_m: you're really hard headed
[20:54:39] <devinceartas> %20 is the same as +
[20:55:15] <christo_m> well then, dunno where the 500 internal error is coming from
[20:55:54] <devinceartas> Somewhere else
[20:56:28] <devinceartas> Try simpler query -- does it work with just "cheese"
[20:56:56] <devinceartas> i=cheese
[20:57:05] <PhonicUK> it works with cheese and cheese,%20carrots
[20:57:19] <PhonicUK> doesn't work with cheese, peppers
[20:57:39] <PhonicUK> and I get a 404 as a result, so I assume that means there are no recipies with cheese and peppers in
[20:57:47] <oojacoboo> PhonicUK: are you related to the company Phonic?
[20:57:57] <PhonicUK> nop
[20:58:07] <systemfault> PhonicUK: It should return an empty result set, not a 404
[20:58:08] <oojacoboo> good
[20:58:17] <PhonicUK> systemfault, indeed - but that's what its doing
[20:58:22] <mvastola> many apologies, as i'm sure i'm the gazillion-and-one-th person to ask, but what's the deal with http://api.jquery.com/?
[20:58:33] <oojacoboo> it's down
[20:58:36] <PhonicUK> it's dead, jim
[20:58:37] <devinceartas> 404 is a legit REST response
[20:58:51] <mvastola> :-(. is it coming back?
[20:59:05] <systemfault> devinceartas: That's not a restful api… that some shitty RPC
[21:00:52] <devinceartas> Heh, I was being overly optimistic perhaps
[21:01:17] <Lyfesaver> do razor and javascript not play well together?
[21:01:23] <systemfault> There aren't much RESTful API in this world… it's more an ideal thatn anything else it seems :(
[21:02:01] <devinceartas> More and more -- I've seen companies converting, building rest
[21:02:28] <devinceartas> Salesforce, Contactology, of course twitter
[21:02:46] <systemfault> They never get their APIs to the level 3 of the RMM
[21:02:55] <systemfault> It's always 2 at most...
[21:03:04] <systemfault> But level 3 is required for an API to be called REST.
[21:03:22] <devinceartas> Companies who don't provide good Apis deserve to be out-competed
[21:03:42] <systemfault> I totally agree
[21:13:00] <christo_m> http://www.recipepuppy.com/api/?i=onions,peppers,carrots
[21:13:12] <christo_m> http://www.recipepuppy.com/?i=onions%2Cpeppers%2Ccarrots&q=
[21:13:21] <christo_m> how the hell is this possible..
[21:14:25] <devinceartas> It's translating and showing how it interpreting the request
[21:14:40] <devinceartas> You can't change how it does that,
[21:14:59] <devinceartas> Only what you send
[21:16:47] <christo_m> devinceartas: my astonishment was moreso to the fact that one returns results and the other 404's
[21:16:52] <christo_m> but i guess i dont have control over that either
[21:17:28] <devinceartas> If it is at all restful, 404 makes complete sense
[21:18:47] <christo_m> you know what, fuck it im gonna use http://punchfork.com/api
[21:18:50] <christo_m> should have done more research
[21:19:16] <devinceartas> :-)
[21:20:14] <systemfault> What a shit APi...
[21:20:25] <systemfault> Sometimes it gives 404s… others, an empty resultset.
[21:21:13] <christo_m> tell me about it.
[21:21:39] <javalover> is there a way to make a div that has an invisible background such that anything that goes behind the div is now hidden?
[21:22:28] <oojacoboo> javalover: background-color: transparent; /*dug*/
[21:22:47] <oojacoboo> :/ /*duh*/
[21:23:24] <devinceartas> Doesn't sound transparent to me if it hides things
[21:23:38] <oojacoboo> lol, background-color..............
[21:23:40] <systemfault> Yeah.. that's a weird question
[21:24:27] <javalover> well i want the stuff scrolling, to scroll behind the divs content
[21:24:37] <javalover> but i don't want a background on the div....
[21:24:57] <oojacoboo> just put something over this div then?
[21:25:10] <javalover> basically i want clipping
[21:25:14] <javalover> i'd like to clip everything around the div
[21:25:39] <javalover> ie if i have [ stuff]  words
[21:25:44] <javalover> and then say i scroll words
[21:25:56] <javalover> it should go [ stuff] ords
[21:25:59] <oojacoboo> javalover: maybe use an image overlay?
[21:26:02] <javalover> and then w [ stuff ] ords
[21:26:04] <christo_m> lol.
[21:26:04] <javalover> like that
[21:26:22] <christo_m> $('div#stuff').annoyify()
[21:26:24] <oojacoboo> or use 4 divs over it with a background color absolute positioned on the top, right, bottom, left
[21:27:44] <oojacoboo> javalover: better yet, set overflow: visible on a child div with parent set to overflow: hidden
[21:27:55] <javalover> that sounds like the answer
[21:28:00] <oojacoboo> making the child div slightly smaller
[21:28:04] <javalover> how do you do that?
[21:28:11] <oojacoboo> #css
[21:28:19] <javalover> no like the order of things
[21:28:29] <oojacoboo> ?
[21:28:34] <javalover> ok so ur saying put the div inside it
[21:28:43] <oojacoboo> yes
[21:28:50] <javalover> hmmm ok so
[21:29:05] <javalover> <div id  = "parent"><div id = "child">
[21:29:15] <javalover> and the parent has overflow hidden?
[21:29:21] <oojacoboo> javalover: make a fiddle
[21:29:27] <javalover> sure 1 sec
[21:32:48] <javalover> http://jsfiddle.net/cvQBd/2/
[21:32:57] <javalover> see how the content isn't being clipped
[21:33:08] <oojacoboo> no
[21:33:11] <javalover> or is it not supposed to be inside?
[21:33:29] <javalover> you can update it correct?
[21:33:52] <oojacoboo> sec
[21:34:50] <javalover> lemme know cuz i don't want to change it if ur changing it
[21:36:01] <oojacoboo> http://jsfiddle.net/cvQBd/3/
[21:36:07] <oojacoboo> ok, so, now, what's the goal here?
[21:36:18] <oojacoboo> P.S. don't hand someone a fiddle in that shape ;)
[21:36:42] <javalover> haha i'm a fiddle noob
[21:36:50] <javalover> the goal is to hide the child underneath the parent
[21:36:53] <javalover> without using a background
[21:36:54] <oojacoboo> apparently you're a coding noob too ;)
[21:37:00] <javalover> sure
[21:37:17] <oojacoboo> hide it how?
[21:37:26] <javalover> make it so it does not display
[21:37:44] <javalover> so like any area that is underneath the parent
[21:37:47] <oojacoboo> http://jsfiddle.net/cvQBd/4/
[21:37:48] <oojacoboo> done
[21:37:49] <javalover> is not visible on screen
[21:38:04] <javalover> lol no
[21:38:12] <javalover> like i should still see half of it
[21:38:12] <oojacoboo> explain yourself better
[21:38:15] <javalover> or all of it if it's outside it
[21:38:17] <javalover> lol
[21:38:32] <oojacoboo> formulate a well stated paragraph, then paste it here
[21:38:39] <javalover> it should cause clipping in any area that the child is behind the parent div
[21:38:40] <oojacoboo> or add a comment in that fiddle code
[21:38:58] <oojacoboo> that's not making any sense
[21:39:09] <javalover> ok, Div A should always be ontop of div B & Div B should appear to be hidden underneath DIV A
[21:39:10] <Whirl3d> I think he is asking about masking
[21:39:15] <javalover> there we go
[21:39:15] <javalover> masking!
[21:39:21] <javalover> how can I mask a div?
[21:39:22] <oojacoboo> I'm getting that, but not sure how
[21:39:28] <oojacoboo> in what fashion
[21:39:48] <oojacoboo> you want to show the portion where the child is visible?
[21:39:51] <oojacoboo> or the parent?
[21:40:00] <javalover> I want the parent to always be visible above the child
[21:40:17] <oojacoboo> with the child text showing behind it?
[21:40:21] <javalover> but if there is invisible space so like [                         ]
[21:40:28] <javalover> all of that should be above the child
[21:40:34] <oojacoboo> ...
[21:40:37] <javalover> it should not ever be like [ child stuff]
[21:40:46] <oojacoboo> dude, you're not making sense
[21:40:49] <javalover> only [            ] stuff
[21:41:02] <Whirl3d> you obviously hae seen something similar done on another site. Can you show us a link?
[21:41:02] <javalover> idk how else to put this
[21:41:05] <oojacoboo> I'm losing interest
[21:41:09] <javalover> no i have not
[21:41:34] <javalover> ok you see how in windows or lynux or whatever you have a window
[21:41:36] <oojacoboo> please use content related to the fiddle with direct references
[21:41:40] <javalover> and everything underneath the window cannot be seen
[21:41:43] <Whirl3d> well, I'm not sure if you have been drinking or if you double up on your meds, but you'rereally not cooherent
[21:41:46] <oojacoboo> yes
[21:41:55] <javalover> i'd like that but i want it without a background
[21:41:56] <oojacoboo> lol
[21:42:08] <oojacoboo> ok
[21:42:25] <coldhead> $('*').hide() ?
[21:42:33] <oojacoboo> http://jsfiddle.net/cvQBd/6/
[21:42:35] <oojacoboo> like that?
[21:43:03] <javalover> no
[21:43:09] <javalover> and based on that imma repeat this
[21:43:12] <oojacoboo> that's like windows
[21:43:15] <oojacoboo> just like what you said
[21:43:32] <javalover> Ok so lets pretend this is the content       ABC  [    ]  123
[21:43:42] <oojacoboo> WTF is [     ]
[21:43:47] <javalover> that is the empty div
[21:43:50] <oojacoboo> LOL
[21:43:52] <javalover> now watch
[21:44:00] <javalover> if i put 123 to the left
[21:44:07] <javalover> it should go like this ABC [    ] 2 3
[21:44:13] <adamSs> hey folks! any idea why the dilog doesn't work?  http://jsfiddle.net/adamsilzell/SSkVs/1/
[21:44:18] <javalover> and then more    ABC [   ] 3
[21:44:22] <javalover> now i fi move back to the right
[21:44:30] <javalover> ABC [   ] 2 3
[21:44:33] <oojacoboo> how are you moving left to right?
[21:44:34] <javalover> ABC [    ]  1 2 3
[21:44:49] <oojacoboo> and you want these side by side?
[21:44:56] <javalover> well 123 can be in a div with left: -15 px;
[21:44:57] <oojacoboo> and we're talking about text?
[21:45:09] <javalover> i'm saying anything that goes underneath the div without a background
[21:45:11] <javalover> should be invisible
[21:45:22] <oojacoboo> why without a background?
[21:45:27] <oojacoboo> why not with a background?
[21:45:36] <javalover> because I also want to see stuff behind the div still
[21:45:39] <Whirl3d> adamSs you are getting an error in the console.
[21:45:40] <oojacoboo> like what?
[21:45:54] <javalover> like the rest of the page
[21:46:07] <oojacoboo> like a background image?
[21:46:13] <javalover> eventually yes
[21:46:17] <javalover> but there are layers
[21:46:17] <oojacoboo> will this part scroll ?
[21:46:31] <javalover> yes
[21:47:39] <javalover> i think i have an answer
[21:47:56] <javalover> if I set overflow hidden to the div i'm moving
[21:48:24] <javalover> hmm
[21:48:56] <javalover> idk
[21:49:27] <javalover> imma look up div mask
[21:49:51] <oojacoboo> http://jsfiddle.net/cvQBd/8/
[21:49:57] <oojacoboo> so, like this kinda?
[21:50:30] <oojacoboo> http://jsfiddle.net/cvQBd/9/
[21:51:12] <oojacoboo> how is the stuff from the left or the right going to "move" ?
[21:52:12] <javalover> good jacob
[21:52:18] <javalover> now put anything from the right or left in the middle
[21:52:20] <javalover> and have it not display
[21:52:23] <javalover> and that works
[21:52:37] <oojacoboo> how does it get to the middle?
[21:52:39] <oojacoboo> that's the question
[21:52:43] <javalover> good question
[21:52:45] <javalover> idk
[21:52:51] <oojacoboo> ...
[21:52:55] <javalover> guess the world will never know
[21:53:00] <oojacoboo> wtf is this
[21:53:20] <oojacoboo> you're not explaining this very well
[21:53:27] <Whirl3d> draggable and sortable?
[21:53:35] <oojacoboo> he doesn't know what that means
[21:53:46] <javalover> ur right jacob
[21:53:49] <javalover> i have no idea what i'm talking about
[21:54:01] <javalover> i should just give up
[21:54:09] <oojacoboo> http://jsfiddle.net/cvQBd/12/
[21:54:11] <javalover> so worthless ohhhhhhhhhhh why me
[21:54:14] <oojacoboo> well, there is the latest bit
[21:54:17] <javalover> USELESS USELESS USELESS
[21:54:25] * javalover bangs head on table for an hour
[21:55:44] <oojacoboo> my guess is you'll want another div inside left and right and will just use left: -15px;
[21:55:49] <oojacoboo> that'll work for you
[21:56:07] <oojacoboo> but I have no idea what your goal is, so whatever, I've lost interest now, g/l
[21:56:12] <javalover> http://jsfiddle.net/cvQBd/16/
[21:56:20] <javalover> you see how I moved the div into the middle one
[21:56:23] <javalover> and I can still see it
[21:56:24] <javalover> that's bad
[21:56:30] <javalover> it's whatever
[21:56:37] <javalover> trolled hardcore
[21:56:55] <javalover> imma restate my original question just to show you how much of a troll you are
[21:57:07] <javalover> is there a way to make a div that has an invisible background such that anything that goes behind the div is now hidden?
[21:57:31] <Whirl3d> javalover go ask #CSS since you have NO JQUERY at all it's all CSS questions. Off Topic
[21:57:34] <javalover> how we get from what I just said, to what you just did is baffling, and you say I can't code trololol
[21:58:32] <Whirl3d> javalover. is there any way to make a clear glass window so that when someone walks behind it, you can't see them?
[21:58:51] <oojacoboo> javalover: http://jsfiddle.net/cvQBd/18/
[21:58:53] <oojacoboo> done
[21:59:28] <oojacoboo> wait, sorry
[21:59:46] <oojacoboo> http://jsfiddle.net/cvQBd/20/
[22:00:13] <Whirl3d> javalover, you are going to have to make the middle div duplicate the background and make it solid
[22:00:28] <oojacoboo> Whirl3d: not true
[22:00:40] <oojacoboo> see the fiddle ;)
[22:00:44] <Whirl3d> either that or your are going to have to manage the state of everyelement (hiding it when they overlaw the middle div and showing it when they don't
[22:00:57] <oojacoboo> not true
[22:01:14] <javalover> i hear what you're saying based on real life whirl3d
[22:01:14] <Whirl3d> now animate that to the left window
[22:01:22] <javalover> but i'm asking a coding question, in code we have more ways to do things
[22:01:43] <oojacoboo> you need the left or the right to show all the way to the other?
[22:01:56] <Whirl3d> that's the problem
[22:02:02] <Whirl3d> otherwise it's just overflow hidden
[22:02:04] <oojacoboo> aka, the content from the left could show in the right?
[22:02:07] <Whirl3d> on the two side lements
[22:02:15] <oojacoboo> Whirl3d: I don' know that to be the case
[22:02:25] <oojacoboo> he hasn't stated
[22:02:55] <javalover> in fact we do have that
[22:03:01] <javalover> it's called a 2 way mirror
[22:03:08] <oojacoboo> ?
[22:03:15] <Whirl3d> like I said, you could duplicate the background
[22:03:25] <javalover> the thought crossed my mind
[22:03:33] <Whirl3d> or you could do overflow hidden
[22:03:48] <javalover> overflow hidden does work the problem is i'm moving the div itself with another div
[22:04:20] <javalover> so i'm not scrolling the content in the div, i'm moving the div
[22:04:36] <javalover> and when I move it, it goes behind this other div & i'd like it to be invisible
[22:04:52] <shoky> huha
[22:05:07] <Whirl3d> javalover, listen: you understand what it means with overflow hidden, right
[22:05:18] <javalover> not exactly I slightly do
[22:05:21] <javalover> but not exactly
[22:05:31] <javalover> lemme just try that one sec
[22:05:35] <Whirl3d> anything outside of the box just disappears
[22:05:46] <Whirl3d> so if it's next to a box, it'll look like it went behind it
[22:06:26] <Whirl3d> and if the box that is next to has a transparent background (like you say you want) it will look like your content went behind the invisible element.
[22:06:58] <shoky> Whirl3d how's the animation script plugin going
[22:07:45] <javalover> as i suspected
[22:07:57] <Whirl3d> bah. I haven't had the chance to even look at it. I have been trying to get this simplest of websites out and it's just not coming together the way I want.
[22:08:05] <shoky> ;(
[22:08:13] <javalover> ok so the problem is this
[22:08:15] <Whirl3d> But, hey: thanks for asking. I really appreciate it.
[22:08:17] <javalover> i have 2 seperate divs
[22:08:23] <javalover> so overflow hidden won't work
[22:08:26] <shoky> what, i wanna try it out
[22:08:45] <oojacoboo> lol
[22:08:55] <oojacoboo> javalover: you don't listen
[22:09:07] <oojacoboo> how old are you, btw?
[22:09:12] <javalover> 5
[22:09:44] <javalover> my birthday was in january
[22:09:44] <oojacoboo> well, don't listen, don't explain well… usually means young
[22:09:47] <javalover> january 22nd
[22:10:02] <oojacoboo> or in the wrong industry
[22:10:04] <javalover> i'm only 5 years old
[22:10:33] <javalover> well 5 and a quarter
[22:11:03] <javalover> do you like baseball cards? I have a cal ripken jr rookie card my grandfather gave me, wanna see it?
[22:11:41] <greggies> nice, ok
[22:12:04] <javalover> the problem with people like jacob, is that they are full of themselves & think they know everything & aren't willing to even listen to the simplest question
[22:12:28] <javalover> and when presented with even the slightest problem they always respond with "why? why would you do that, ur dumb"
[22:12:38] <shoky> javalover i'm listening, what's the prob?
[22:12:47] <javalover> lets face it, I have an issue i'd like to hide stuff behind my div...seems like it's fucking impossible
[22:13:05] <javalover> apparently in order to hide stuff I have to have a background...but I don't want a background so tuff? that's the answer tuff?
[22:13:17] <oojacoboo> pretty much
[22:13:20] <Whirl3d> javalover, if anyone has the patience to help you, shoky does. If he tells you that your are full of shit, you can trust that he is not being a snob
[22:13:20] <javalover> no no make me a jsfiddle is the answer
[22:13:28] <shoky> ;D
[22:13:33] <javalover> go make a js fiddle "really he made one, k lets mess with him"
[22:13:48] <javalover> ok Shoky
[22:14:03] <javalover> I have a div with text inside it the problem is i have another div i am going to put behind this div
[22:14:09] <oojacoboo> http://jsfiddle.net/cvQBd/20/  use that shoky b/c he can't explain it
[22:14:17] <javalover> when I do that...I end up with this really annoying problem where the text overlays the other divs content
[22:14:29] <javalover> so what i'd like to do is make an invisible boundary box on my div that anything going behind it is now hidden
[22:14:50] <javalover> is this possible?
[22:15:51] <shoky> trying to understand 1st sentence.. you have a div 'textDiv' . you have another div that you put BEHIND 'textDiv'? what do you mean by behind.
[22:16:04] <javalover> well not in front
[22:16:06] <javalover> but BEHIND
[22:16:19] <javalover> ya know behind
[22:16:33] <shoky> behind so that 'textDiv' is in front of it, so this other div is hidden ?
[22:16:38] <javalover> here div a z-index:2  div b z-index:0
[22:16:40] <javalover> hows that?
[22:16:44] <shoky> great.
[22:17:15] <shoky> <javalover> so what i'd like to do is make an invisible boundary box on my div that anything going behind it is now hidden
[22:17:19] <shoky> 'my div' = ?
[22:17:57] <javalover> <div id = "foreground"> </div>  <div id = "background"></div>
[22:18:37] <javalover> such that if i put foreground at top:0 left:0  and then i put background in the same spot, you can only see foreground
[22:18:40] <shoky> anything going behind it is now hidden <-- hidden by what?
[22:18:53] <oojacoboo> shoky: it can't be done without replicating the background image or some fancy coding to move content around between two divs
[22:19:06] <oojacoboo> this is such a waste of time
[22:19:10] <javalover> i don't understand they have this thing called clipping
[22:19:14] <javalover> you can do this on an image
[22:19:19] <oojacoboo> it's not a thing javalover
[22:19:27] <oojacoboo> it's a term
[22:19:42] <javalover> first of all jacob why are you even responding, here you are with ur negativity
[22:19:46] <javalover> whereas shoky was trying to help
[22:19:46] <oojacoboo> you can do it in an image editor, not in html/css
[22:19:53] <oojacoboo> shoky can't help
[22:20:00] <javalover> wtf why can I do this in an image editor but not in html?
[22:20:00] <oojacoboo> and you're wasting his time and anyone elses
[22:20:13] <oojacoboo> ...
[22:20:25] <shoky> javalover: the only thing that can hide the background div is either the pixels of the text itself, or the pixels of textDiv's background
[22:20:35] <shoky> agreed?
[22:20:40] <javalover> sort of
[22:20:47] <javalover> I mean I agree with the idea of it
[22:20:54] <shoky> what dont you agree with
[22:20:58] <javalover> so is there a way I could make a function instead?
[22:21:02] <shoky> huh
[22:21:03] <shoky> ?
[22:21:08] <javalover> perhaps I could add clipping to the 2nd div
[22:21:11] <oojacoboo> shoky: give up man
[22:21:16] <shoky> never !
[22:21:17] <javalover> everytime it enters the area of the foreground div
[22:21:22] <shoky> well only when i fall asleep cuz im sleepy
[22:21:49] <oojacoboo> shoky: we've already gone over all this
[22:21:56] <javalover> is this possible? can I add clipping to a div?
[22:21:56] <shoky> javalover: anything hiding the background div would have to be a pixel of a certain color. agreed?
[22:21:59] <shoky> javalover: anything hiding the background div would have to be a pixel of a certain color. agreed?
[22:22:00] <shoky> javalover: anything hiding the background div would have to be a pixel of a certain color. agreed?
[22:22:03] <Whirl3d> oojacoboo, I say around 1;30 EST (9 minutes from now) Wanna bet?
[22:22:09] <oojacoboo> hah
[22:22:19] <javalover> no
[22:22:19] <javalover> not agreed
[22:22:21] <javalover> because of this
[22:22:50] <javalover> http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/tryit.asp?filename=trycss_clip
[22:23:00] <shoky> i wont open that link
[22:23:06] <shoky> see www.w3fools.com
[22:23:07] <javalover> ok well then cuz of clipping
[22:23:29] <javalover> clip:rect(0px,60px,200px,0px);
[22:23:37] <javalover> can't I use this to hide anything inside that area?
[22:23:41] <oojacoboo> css3 not well supported
[22:23:51] <javalover> or outside wrather...
[22:23:53] <javalover> hmmmmmmmm
[22:24:31] <Whirl3d> you apply cliprect (like a mask) to an element
[22:24:39] <Whirl3d> and it shows only the clipped area
[22:25:03] <Whirl3d> but that' doesnt' affect things in front of or behind it.
[22:25:07] <Whirl3d> just the clipped element
[22:25:39] <javalover> umm
[22:26:52] <javalover> so how hard would it be to take like a screen shot of the page
[22:26:57] <javalover> and use that as the background on the div?
[22:27:20] <Whirl3d> easy in php with a graphics library, I don't know about javascript.
[22:28:01] <Whirl3d> I wish I knew the effect you were looking for, because there is probably a much easier way to do what you want, but you haven't really explained what you want in a way that I can undestand yet.
[22:28:27] <javalover> this is best way as far as I can see
[22:28:57] <javalover> [234 my content 234]    <-- what it looks like when they are combined ewww bad
[22:29:00] <greggies> that seems like an over-elaborate solution
[22:29:20] <javalover> [ my content ] 34    234  <-- much better
[22:29:27] <javalover> and as we move anything behind it
[22:29:40] <javalover> [ my content ] 234
[22:29:41] <javalover> and eventually
[22:29:42] <Whirl3d> what is it?
[22:29:46] <javalover> 234 [ my content ] 234
[22:29:51] <javalover> just try to look at it
[22:29:59] <javalover> you see how nothing is seen behind my content
[22:30:06] <javalover> but what i have right now is the original
[22:30:16] <javalover> so everything goes behind & is seen
[22:30:48] <javalover> overflow:hidden does this
[22:30:56] <javalover> but the problem is that's only for stuff inside that div
[22:30:57] <Whirl3d> javalover, I am going to repeat what you just said in a different context and mayb you'll understand why this is so weird:
[22:31:11] <shoky> i think i understand what he wants
[22:31:23] <shoky> i'll try to fiddle smth to maybe make it clearer
[22:31:38] <javalover> ty shoky I appreciate you taking the time
[22:31:53] <Whirl3d> so I have three divs with content in them like this  [diva[divb][divc] now notice how there's nothing behind it.
[22:32:16] <Whirl3d> So I want to move these behind it wihtout it showing
[22:32:22] <Whirl3d> are you confused yet?
[22:32:25] <javalover> no
[22:32:27] <javalover> keep talking
[22:32:41] <Whirl3d> Funny because I haven't defined
[22:32:42] <Whirl3d> these
[22:32:44] <Whirl3d> it
[22:32:47] <Whirl3d> these items
[22:32:54] <Whirl3d> so how can you know
[22:32:55] <javalover> you don't need to I can see them
[22:32:58] <Whirl3d> you can't
[22:33:06] <javalover> yes i can you have div a div b & div c
[22:33:10] <Whirl3d> I haven't even thought of them yet
[22:33:52] <javalover> fine
[22:33:59] <Whirl3d> I want to move these behind it...what is these? what is it?
[22:34:28] <javalover> <div id = "a">  <p> My stuff </p>  </div>   <div id = "b" > <p> background k </p> </div>
[22:34:30] <javalover> that's my code
[22:34:45] <javalover> when it appears on the screen as per using style = "left:200px" etc psuedo
[22:35:00] <javalover> it will show up like this   [ My Stuff] background k
[22:35:19] <javalover> upon moving div b  I want it to appear like this   [ My Stuff ] ckground k
[22:35:23] <Whirl3d> so javalover, why won't you make a fiddle demonstrating what you want? Why do you refuse to do that?
[22:35:32] <javalover> ba  [  My Stuff ] ground k
[22:35:47] <javalover> or back [ My Stuff ] ground K
[22:36:02] <javalover> because a fiddle won't help
[22:36:09] <javalover> it will only demonstrate failure
[22:36:14] <javalover> and i already did that & got trolled
[22:36:30] <Whirl3d> a fiddle that demonstrates failure IS A GREAT WAY TO START
[22:36:37] <javalover> fine one sec
[22:36:38] <Whirl3d> that's what it's for
[22:36:56] <javalover> http://jsfiddle.net/cvQBd/3/
[22:37:01] <javalover> oh look from my browser
[22:37:11] <Whirl3d> then I look at what youa re trying to do, and figure out where to help you. It's not that we are tring to spend all night fighting with you over this. We are really trying to help
[22:37:11] <javalover> notice how they are overlaying each other & it looks terrible
[22:37:23] <javalover> I believe you are
[22:37:26] <javalover> and so is stoky
[22:37:28] <javalover> but jacob
[22:37:31] <javalover> jacob straight trolled me
[22:37:54] <Whirl3d> javalover, there is NO JQUERY in your fiddle. Don't you think this is a question for #CSS
[22:38:17] <javalover> it may or may not be a question for #CSS
[22:38:20] <Whirl3d> if you are having problems with your CSS, why don't you ask the css people?
[22:38:41] <Whirl3d> It is certainly not a jquery issue. You haven't even written an y jquery that we could help with
[22:39:09] <shoky> mm maybe something like this ;S http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/cvQBd/24/
[22:39:28] <shoky> its not the desired effect but same behaviour i guess
[22:40:07] <Whirl3d> if I am understanding him correclty it's the polar opposite of that
[22:40:27] <Whirl3d> I'll show you a way to cludge it together
[22:40:56] <javalover> he's right
[22:41:01] <javalover> it is the exact opossite of that
[22:41:06] <javalover> wait no wait
[22:41:08] <javalover> i think he's wrong
[22:41:13] <javalover> i think shoky is right
[22:41:23] <javalover> YES SHOKY!
[22:41:25] <javalover> can we do that?
[22:41:30] <shoky> uh
[22:41:36] <shoky> either with clipping ;p
[22:41:49] <javalover> yeah like can we do that at all?
[22:42:06] <r3za> hi , i guys , i have a table with 100% width , now i want to hide a column in jquery , i wrote this : $("#tree").hide("drop", { direction: "left" }, 1000); but i didnt work well
[22:42:16] <shoky> or... dynamically cutting up and stitching up the white container div whenever the text div is positioned/resized
[22:42:17] <r3za> what should i do ?
[22:42:26] <shoky> like.. tesselating it ;D
[22:42:27] <shoky> or smth
[22:42:35] <javalover> haha well atleast you understand me
[22:43:05] <javalover> hold up wheres jacob?
[22:43:19] <javalover> http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/cvQBd/24/  OH JACOB!!! READ THAT!
[22:43:21] <oojacoboo> ha
[22:43:29] <javalover> see shoky understands me
[22:43:34] <javalover> cuz shoky is not a noob
[22:43:45] <oojacoboo> javalover: is the text in both divs at the same time?
[22:43:46] <javalover> UR THE NOOB lol ok i'm done thx for reading that
[22:43:50] <oojacoboo> I have a solution
[22:43:52] <javalover> not trying to troll just very upset
[22:43:59] <shoky> you could make a jquery plugin to do the cutting up if you want ;p tho doesnt seem too useful
[22:44:49] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/cvQBd/28/
[22:44:50] <javalover> wow i thought for sure there would be like a simple command for this
[22:45:02] <oojacoboo> javalover: http://jsfiddle.net/P4D76/8/
[22:45:11] <oojacoboo> you'd just swap the styles as the text moves
[22:45:36] <javalover> can't you just use his cat example?
[22:45:37] <javalover> and fix it
[22:45:39] <javalover> i like the cat
[22:45:42] <oojacoboo> no
[22:45:46] <oojacoboo> b/c it's way different
[22:45:47] <javalover> no of course not
[22:45:56] <javalover> no lets not fix his fiddle or anything
[22:45:58] <javalover> lets just make our own
[22:49:05] <javalover> shoky: I wonder if we could just clip the white rectangle as it's around the text
[22:51:41] <oojacoboo> http://jsfiddle.net/cvQBd/43/
[22:51:45] <oojacoboo> solution #2
[22:52:38] <shoky> nice
[22:52:47] <oojacoboo> http://jsfiddle.net/cvQBd/47/
[22:52:50] <oojacoboo> done
[22:53:33] <jrockjiggz> how can i only bind to the first child in each EL.  $('.optionalBox legend:first'); works only for the first <div class="optionalBox"><legend>
[22:53:56] <oojacoboo> jrockjiggz: legend:first-child
[22:54:46] <jrockjiggz> oojacoboo: awesome thanks
[22:54:51] <shoky> javalover: donno. as Whirl3d said it's a css issue
[22:55:39] <shoky> if you want full control use a canvas
[22:56:51] <javalover> jacob ur a troll
[22:57:12] <javalover> first of all although that could work
[22:57:19] <javalover> how am I supposed to gain the image in real time?
[22:57:21] <oojacoboo> fuck you
[22:57:23] <javalover> and second of all ur a troll
[22:57:43] <oojacoboo> rarely do I mean that, but really… FUCK YOU
[22:57:59] <shoky> the assumption was that the image (or whatever is in the 'background') would be one of the layers painted on the canvas
[22:58:23] <javalover> what shocks me is that
[22:58:28] <javalover> we have this thing called overflow:hidden
[22:58:36] <javalover> which works amazingly well I wish I could just use that to achieve this
[22:59:30] <Whirl3d> javalover, you are out of line. Seriously. Jacob's first solution an hour ago used overflow hidden to get what you wanted and you are gonna call him out for being a troll. If I were an admin, I'd have kicked you a long time ago.
[23:00:00] <javalover> that was not a solution
[23:00:31] <javalover> and he proceeded to tell me I had no idea what I was talking about
[23:00:44] <javalover> and or that it could not be done
[23:00:46] <Whirl3d> it showed how you could position elements inside a neighboring div with overlow hidden to make it look like it was being obscured by the empty div
[23:00:47] <javalover> which is trolling
[23:01:24] <Whirl3d> I would gladly ask any admin to review this session and make a decision about who was trolling and who needed to be kicked.
[23:01:39] <javalover> and that would be trolling
[23:02:02] <javalover> it's okay it sounds like this is impossible
[23:02:07] <Whirl3d> no, that would be the joy of ignoring
[23:02:21] * shoky farts
[23:02:25] <javalover> lolol
[23:02:37] <Whirl3d> Do I smell roses?
[23:02:43] <shoky> and peaches
[23:03:03] <javalover> damn seemed like this was achievable i guess not
[23:04:54] <shoky> you could jsu twork with oojacoboo's suggestion here http://jsfiddle.net/cvQBd/43/
[23:05:11] <shoky> setting the background of the textDiv to same background you have on the page
[23:05:47] <shoky> but yea that wont work if there are just elements there
[23:06:02] <shoky> also,
[23:06:04] <shoky> gnight
[23:06:11] <Whirl3d> night.
