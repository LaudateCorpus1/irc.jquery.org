[19:31:15] * robertmaxrees looks into his crystal ball
[19:31:23] <robertmaxrees> weird, i can't see your markup... ;)
[19:31:24] <Northwoods> :))
[19:31:28] <robertmaxrees> jsfiddle pls
[19:31:32] <Northwoods> ;)
[19:32:09] <Northwoods> i just need to get text of p element  of the closest td
[19:32:20] <Northwoods> robertmaxrees, i dont' want to do fiddle for that
[19:32:22] <robertmaxrees> *sigh*
[19:32:50] <robertmaxrees> so you're just loking for the p tag inside .contact_name?
[19:32:55] <Northwoods> right
[19:33:14] <robertmaxrees> '.contact_name p' ...
[19:33:35] <Northwoods> *sigh* , i am nuts , thanks
[19:34:01] <robertmaxrees> in the future, making a fiddle helps avoid the need for clarification.  i don't ask just because.
[19:34:21] <robertmaxrees> i ask because otherwise i'm relying on descriptions that may or may not accurately describe the root problem.
[19:41:21] <Northwoods> robertmaxrees, right
[19:41:26] <Northwoods> Thanks again man
