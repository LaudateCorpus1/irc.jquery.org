[00:07:19] <robertparkerx> Uncaught TypeError: Cannot use 'in' operator to search for 'length' in [{"user_id":"1","user_name":"admin"},{"user_id":"6","user_name":"employee1"}]
[00:08:13] <robertparkerx> jQuery.each(obj.users, function(index,element) { alert(index + ": " + element); });
[00:12:21] <robertparkerx> Can someone help me understand what this means
[00:12:28] <robertparkerx> I thought, http://api.jquery.com/jquery.each/
[00:13:53] <robertparkerx> oh
[00:13:54] <robertparkerx> :s
[00:15:55] <robertparkerx> parseJSON
[00:21:12] <gambl0re> whats up all
[00:21:59] <gambl0re> if use 'this' inside an event handler, what is the value of 'this
[00:22:48] <gambl0re> only people with advanced js knowledge will know the answer
[00:23:03] <Justin53> gambl0re: it should be the element object
[00:23:42] <gambl0re> <button> element?
[00:23:47] <Justin53> the element that the event is bound to, i think
[00:24:12] <gambl0re> http://jsbin.com/decudukobu/edit?html,js,console,output
[00:25:47] <Justin53> oh i thought you meant a jquery event handler
[00:26:16] <gambl0re> should be the same thing..
[00:26:16] <Justin53> in the case of that jsbin it's just "window"
[00:26:42] <Justin53> i'm pretty sure only jquery event handlers set "this" to the element
[00:27:06] <Justin53> if you instead log "this === window" it logs "true" in that jsbin
[00:27:29] <gambl0re> if i did $(button).on('click', function(){ console.log(this)} => 'this' would point to button?
[00:29:14] <Justin53> yes
[00:30:00] <gambl0re> but why?
[00:30:48] <systemfault> gambl0re: Don't be stupid, why would it be the same with jQuery as with the DOM?
[00:31:06] <systemfault> jQuery uses the "this" in their event handler to refer to the targeted element.
[00:31:12] <systemfault> With DOM, it's not like that.
[00:31:26] <gambl0re> no need for insults, just asking.
[00:31:41] <systemfault> On two different channels... for two days? :(
[00:32:40] <gambl0re> cause im wathcing this video and he's trying to explain 'this' with an event handler and he keeps saying 'this' points to some "mysterious" context...wtf
[00:32:51] <gambl0re> anyways
[00:50:38] <alexwaters> i am doing a loop of  ajax calls and then calling two function on each success. the first function creates a DOM element using data from the ajax response. the second function attaches a child element to the first function's element. the ajax calls occur, and the first function's elements are created in the dom incrementally, but the second function's append doesn't happen until all of the calls have been completed. does anyone know how I could
[00:52:12] <systemfault> Is it possible to see the relevant code?
[00:52:24] <systemfault> Also, your message got cut.
[00:53:18] <robertparkerx> ya your message cutoff
[00:53:19] <alexwaters> systemfault: ok let me just post it up sorry. one min
[00:53:36] <robertparkerx> ended at "does anyone know how I could"
[00:56:22] <alexwaters> http://paste.ofcode.org/xzfgPzsBBYqUYewPNxMdkM lines 60 and 61 are the issue
[00:56:48] <alexwaters> it creates all the sliders, but it waits for the page to completely load before attaching the global-score elements
[00:57:14] <alexwaters> from earlier: "does anyone know how I could have the second function's append happen right after the first?"
[00:58:11] <alexwaters> but the console.log shows the gscores as each element is created (so i don't understand why it is waiting to apply the css)
[00:59:30] <alexwaters> please forgive me for the ugly code, I am a javascript noob
[01:13:16] <robertparkerx> is it possible to iterate through a hidden input json encoded value that is a multidimensional array and remove the array that matches a keys value?
[01:40:01] <alexwaters> systemfault: any chance you know why it's rendering the second function after all of the ajax calls have completed and not incrementally like the first function?
[01:40:16] <systemfault> alexwaters: Looking
[01:41:19] <systemfault> holy shit, are you really firing 150 ajax calls at the same time :D?
[01:41:38] <robertparkerx> lol
[01:45:33] <systemfault> Wow, and your slider does multiple ajax call.. for each of the 150 calls.
[01:45:57] <systemfault> I'm scared.
[01:54:10] <robertparkerx> I tried to set a session variable from an object through an ajax post and the objects value is json_encoded (coming from PDO) but i keep getting null
[01:54:14] <jak2000> is correct: http://jsfiddle.net/8Ltaou9j/4/   add a <br>?
[01:54:59] <alexwaters> systemfault: lol
[01:55:39] <systemfault> alexwaters: I don't know what to do with that to be honest :(
[01:55:51] <robertparkerx> jak2000 i looks like it is working?
[01:56:07] <jak2000> yes
[01:56:13] <jak2000> but is correct add a br?
[01:56:18] <jak2000> or exist other way?
[01:56:28] <alexwaters> systemfault: i do so many calls because I want to lazy load each of the items instead of the user having to wait for all of them at once
[01:56:32] <systemfault> alexwaters: You're doing 150 requests at the beginning, then when any of them finishes, you initialize the slider a few times (It's in the .each).. which does another ajax call
[01:56:53] <robertparkerx> jak2000, there are more than one way to skin a cat?
[01:56:59] <jak2000> :)
[01:57:01] <robertparkerx> :p
[01:57:07] <alexwaters> systemfault: the second call only triggers when the slider is moved
[01:57:16] <jak2000> robertparkerx wch programming language do you know in the server side?
[01:57:22] <robertparkerx> php
[01:57:25] <alexwaters> systemfault: basically, when the user moves a slider it triggers a call.
[01:57:51] <systemfault> alexwaters: Aren't you calling make_slider everytime a ajax call finishes?
[01:58:00] <systemfault> Like 60
[01:58:01] <systemfault> *Line
[01:58:31] <alexwaters> systemfault: ah yes, but that is just a js library i import in the beginning. bootstrap-slider
[01:58:50] <alexwaters> systemfault: it just dresses up the sliders, it doesn't make another ajax call
[01:58:57] <systemfault> Right.
[02:00:25] <robertparkerx> $guideRow = $guide_query->fetch(PDO::FETCH_ASSOC); $_SESSION["addto_users"] = json_decode($guideRow->users);  return null but the jquery from the success data I parse from $data = $guideRow; json_encode($data); var obj = json.PARSE(data); obj.users returns [{"user_id":"1","user_name":"admin"},{"user_id":"6","user_name":"employee1"}]
[02:00:31] <robertparkerx> I don't understand
[02:01:19] <robertparkerx> or I should say is null when I attempt to save the post data that is loaded
[02:01:35] <robertparkerx> because the tables row is null
[02:01:56] <robertparkerx> i thought i could set a session variable from jquery through ajax post?

[02:15:00] <jak2000> how to send to a php file and redraw it?
[02:15:14] <jak2000> i am interested in this String: var dataURL = canvas.toDataURL();
[02:18:02] <robertparkerx> I fixed my issue :D
[02:18:08] <robertparkerx> one second let me check jak
[02:19:09] <robertparkerx> jquery.("button").click(function() {
[02:19:12] <robertparkerx> crap wait
[02:21:56] <robertparkerx> why are you wanting to use php?
[02:22:08] <jak2000> my scenario
[02:22:19] <jak2000> i have a canvfas on  my webpage as you see
[02:22:20] <robertparkerx> isnt it being drawn via javascxrpt
[02:22:23] <robertparkerx> javascript
[02:22:35] <jak2000> *canvas
[02:22:38] <robertparkerx> okay
[02:22:47] <jak2000> then with ajax i display a pdf (i use javajspservlet)
[02:23:07] <jak2000> and then in this pdf and or in a email i want redraw the canvas....
[02:23:10] <jak2000> is the final job
[02:23:13] <jak2000> how do it?
[02:23:46] <jak2000> decx say me use canvas.toDataURL();  and create a new img on the emailll and assign the .toDataUrl
[02:23:52] <jak2000> but by moment not luck
[02:23:52] <robertparkerx> is this image/canvas passed to the pdf ?

[06:07:04] <kyshtynbai> Hi guys! I get a JSON codded array from server. I'd like to print each key=>value pair in a new <div>. How do I properly implement this function? In other words I'd like to create that number of divs as there're key-value pairs in the JSON responce
[06:27:15] <Xatenev> $.each(array, function(key,val) { $('#container').append('<div>'+key+val+'</div>'});
[06:27:27] <Xatenev> the braces in the end arent correct tho
[09:10:30] <jomofcw> Hello !
[09:11:22] <jomofcw> Is it normal that when I do $element2.append($element1.contents()); I lose all the handler placed on the children of $element1 ?
[09:14:05] <decx> dont append contents then
[09:14:05] <taplar> direct bindings on the children?
[09:14:40] <decx> just append the element itself
[09:17:37] <decx> if you check out the source of contents() it's pretty obvious
[09:17:51] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/chaxdLjz/  seems to work
[09:18:54] <decx> wierd
[09:19:06] <taplar> i'm guessing maybe he's doing some delegates
[09:20:57] <decx> man these delegates only make problems
[09:21:10] <decx> said bernie
[09:21:13] <taplar> :)
[09:24:04] <jomofcw> taplar thanks for your example. Yea my debug just show me that the handler is there, but doesn't work as expected. That's AJAX refresh of content, and work with history.js. I just have to find why the handler doesn't work as expected when refresh. Thanks for your help.
[09:27:46] <jomofcw> Fixed ! My handler was writed to use the original contexte not the new one of the clone.
[09:43:51] <jquery469> on the second page of this website, I need to check if there's for a specific "livello", if there's an "half freeday". It means that, moreover a full free day, I need another one with 12h consecutives of rest
[09:43:52] <jquery469> http://181.224.135.163/~tommasom/node/add/rapporto-di-lavoro
[09:44:53] <jquery469> so I thought to use a function like this one: http://kopy.io/oV4ZW
[09:45:28] <jquery469> to check if, for each day, I have two inputs "empty"
[09:46:29] <jquery469> for each day I need to save the value of the 4 input in an array, and then check in there are 2 empty strings in it
[09:47:37] <jquery469> my problem is with my function, "a" is saving only the first input for each day, how can I save all the four inputs?
[09:50:45] <taplar> you could just count the number of inputs that are empty
[09:51:31] <taplar> ...filter(function(){ return this.value.trim() == ''; }).length === 2
[09:53:09] <jquery469> the filter added after?
[09:53:32] <taplar> off of the find for the inputs off of the day
[11:20:49] <mephx> hey guys, while using jquery get on a service that either replies 200 or 400, when success function is called, json response is stored directly in data object, when fail promise method is called, the data is in data.responseJSON. the response is built the exact same way server-side. is this supposed to be happening? why does this happen?
[11:29:25] <taplar> it looks like it is
[11:29:47] <taplar> if you look at the the parameters passed into those different callbacks, the first argument is different
[11:30:00] <MikeD_> is there a way to make a jquery collection from an arbitrary group of objects that i already have references to?
[11:30:03] <taplar> success gets an "Anything' data, while error gets a jqXhr
[11:30:30] <taplar> MikeD_: you can use add() to include a dom element into an existing stack
[11:30:41] <MikeD_> thanks
[11:52:19] <daslicht> i am trying to reset a from like this :  $('#myform')[0].reset();
[11:52:33] <daslicht> why do I get : TypeError: $(...)[0].reset is not a function
[11:52:34] <daslicht> ?
[11:52:56] <taplar> is reset an Element method?
[11:53:12] <blakespot> greetings
[11:53:28] <daslicht> taplar: shouldnt it of a form ?
[11:53:40] <daslicht> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16452699/how-to-reset-a-form-using-jquery-with-reset-method
[11:53:50] <daslicht> at least it is suggested here
[11:54:20] <daslicht> http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_form_reset.asp
[11:54:35] <blakespot> I have a listing of data, each item in its own div with a common class on each div and a unique attribute that is: data-category="1001" (for example)
[11:54:45] <daslicht> I tried it here with vanilla js but that even fails : http://jsbin.com/vedofeg/edit?html,css,console,output
[11:54:49] <blakespot> <div class="classname" data-category="1002"> etc.
[11:55:04] <blakespot> How can I "grab" a div by the data-category attribute?
[11:55:13] <blakespot> Say I want div with data-category = 1004
[11:55:19] <blakespot> can I do this, as I could w/ ID?
[11:55:23] <taplar> grab your divs and filter by the data element
[11:55:44] <blakespot> loop over with 'each' and evaluate the data-category attrib?
[11:55:52] <taplar> filter()
[11:56:57] <blakespot> reading re: filter()
[12:01:14] <taplar> daslicht: https://jsfiddle.net/8gfL058m/
[12:01:40] <daslicht> what ius teh differende to mine ?
[12:01:54] <taplar> not sure
[12:02:23] <daslicht> http://jsbin.com/vexesa/edit?html,css,console,output
[12:02:36] <daslicht> I also have it running like this, but I like to know whey the other example fails :D
[12:04:19] <decx> how weird
[12:09:12] <blakespot> $(".classname").filter(function() { $(this).attr("data-category") === "1004"; }) .css("border","2px red solid");
[12:09:16] <blakespot> taplar: That sort of thing?
[12:09:42] <taplar> yep, but use data('category')
[12:09:47] <decx> filter returns stuff
[12:10:06] <taplar> yeah, you need return.  it expects a boolean return
[12:10:15] <decx> does this thing do this? -> INTO THE PILE
[12:10:30] <taplar> hmm?
[12:10:54] <decx> also attr('data-category') yikes
[12:11:13] <decx> unless you display stuff with css content: attr() there's no reason to ever rely on attr for data
[12:11:35] <blakespot> taplar: This existing code has the div like this: <div class="xxx" data-group="yyy" data-category="zzz">
[12:11:43] <blakespot> so data('category') then
[12:11:48] <taplar> yes
[12:11:59] <blakespot> I did not realize data[...] was a defined format
[12:12:09] <blakespot> I thought data- was arbitrary - did not know that about jQ
[12:12:15] <decx> it's magical in jquery
[12:12:18] <taplar> ^
[12:12:22] <decx> because you can attach anything and not just strings
[12:12:26] <blakespot> (assumed something like my-category="ccc" would fly)
[12:12:30] <decx> need a reference, into the data pile!
[12:12:37] <decx> need a function, into the pile
[12:12:42] <taplar> uh, think there is some confustion
[12:12:46] <taplar> confusion
[12:12:50] <taplar> almost did the t again, lol
[12:13:07] <decx> this isnt xml you cant just create new attributes willy nilly
[12:13:10] <taplar> attr() goes against the dom element attributes, so it would need to match the key itself
[12:13:21] <taplar> but data() takes care of the data- prefix for you
[12:13:42] <taplar> it's expected so it removes that boiler plating for you
[12:13:46] <blakespot> yes I understand -- I was unaware of data() being a thing.
[12:13:48] <blakespot> Thanks.
[12:13:56] <taplar> hokay
[12:16:05] <daslicht> taplar: funny when I move the rest button out of teh form it is working
[12:16:55] <taplar> i closed the window.  what kind of button was it again?
[12:17:06] <taplar> i wonder if your getting a submit
[12:18:39] <decx> pretty sure it's just some weird thing all of us are overlooking
[12:19:06] <taplar> originally i thought it might have been a null thing, but the form existed, :/
[12:19:25] <decx> yeah i logged and even did like .style.display = 'none' instead of .reset() which worked on click
[12:19:39] <taplar> and get by id shouldn't return an array
[12:21:36] <jquery173> taplar_lunch: have a nice lunch!
[12:25:34] <daslicht> https://jsfiddle.net/4sjcd080/
[12:25:43] <daslicht> funky stuff
[12:25:46] <taplar_lunch> grr, long food lines
[12:26:13] <daslicht> form reset only works if the invoking button is outside teh form or has no id assigned
[12:26:59] <taplar> wth
[12:29:08] <daslicht> :D
[12:29:26] <decx> well i dont get it
[12:29:31] <daslicht> ?
[12:29:39] <decx> how about just <input type="reset" value="reset">
[12:29:48] <decx> it's like official i think
[12:29:52] <daslicht> still broken
[12:29:57] <decx> without js
[12:30:02] <daslicht> ok let me create fiddle
[12:30:05] <daslicht> ...
[12:30:10] <daslicht> its about js here
[12:30:12] <daslicht> not normal
[12:30:23] <jquery173> still problem of today
[12:30:28] <jquery173> http://181.224.135.163/~tommasom/node/add/rapporto-di-lavoro
[12:30:28] <daslicht> i bet it is wormking with input reset
[12:30:56] <daslicht> but what if i dont wanht to get my pare refreshed on reset ...
[12:31:01] <taplar> wth would an id change that...
[12:31:08] <daslicht> dont ask me
[12:31:12] <daslicht> just my inspection
[12:31:14] <jquery173> why this one: http://kopy.io/NgDRS gives me only the first input?
[12:31:19] <daslicht> try it : https://jsfiddle.net/4sjcd080/
[12:32:00] <taplar> jquery173: are there multiple inputs?  val() is off of a single element.  it's not geared to return an array iirc
[12:32:04] <daslicht> unless you remove the id or move the button (or input) outof the form it wornt work
[12:32:12] <decx> ah
[12:32:18] <decx> now it's beginning to make sense
[12:32:22] <decx> because of how forms work
[12:32:33] <decx> an element with an id would create a form property called reset
[12:32:35] <daslicht> ok , please emlighten me :)
[12:32:36] <decx> overriding the function
[12:33:04] <taplar> lol
[12:33:07] <decx> https://jsfiddle.net/decx/4sjcd080/1/
[12:33:13] <taplar> wow, so it was just a perfect storm
[12:33:16] <decx> yep
[12:33:20] <jquery173> taplar: ok, as I return all the for input? because the expression you gave me today only match the first input
[12:33:20] <taplar> i gave it an id of 'clear' and it worked
[12:33:34] <daslicht> https://jsfiddle.net/4sjcd080/ no reset ?
[12:33:57] <decx> look at the form in a dom viewer
[12:33:58] <daslicht> https://jsfiddle.net/4sjcd080/1
[12:34:14] <decx> it'll create properties for inputs with ids
[12:35:32] <daslicht> dom viewer?
[12:35:37] <daslicht> is that possible in chome ?
[12:35:47] <decx> yeah
[12:35:53] <decx> but it's small and malnourished
[12:36:07] <decx> https://jsfiddle.net/decx/4sjcd080/1/
[12:36:11] <decx> makes it obvious tho
[12:36:36] <taplar> jquery173: https://jsfiddle.net/1yuv2hx6/
[12:36:39] <taplar> try that
[12:36:57] <taplar> i thought earlier though you were wanting to see if 2 were blank
[12:37:04] <jquery173> I was thinking something similar, I will try!
[12:37:05] <daslicht> decx: ahh ok freset points to teh button
[12:37:13] <jquery173> ok no prob!
[12:37:35] <decx> never realized that inputs with ids get their own property on the form object
[12:37:35] <daslicht> decx: lol , memo to my self  , never use generic names ...
[12:37:37] <decx> seems dangerous ^^
[12:37:58] <daslicht> thank you decx
[12:37:59] <daslicht> !
[12:38:03] <decx> np we all learned
[12:38:14] <decx> and beat ##javascript too
[12:38:17] <decx> today was a good day
[12:38:22] <daslicht> so to recal ... do not use 'reset' as a id :)
[12:38:49] <daslicht> there was even no reaction in teh js channel to my question :)
[12:39:51] <jquery173> this I like more!
[12:40:28] <blakespot> taplar: Could you peek at this? Can you help me understand why this is not working?
[12:40:31] <blakespot> http://codepen.io/blakespot/pen/KzXKKJ
[12:40:33] <blakespot> Simplified case.
[12:40:36] <blakespot> tnx
[12:42:12] <taplar> so your wanting to preselect the matching element?
[12:42:27] <blakespot> Exactly
[12:42:43] <decx> do that on the serverside
[12:42:49] <blakespot> Taking an existing large system and using it in a new capacity, needing to preselect
[12:43:17] <taplar> yeah initial thought would be to do it on server side with the html attribute
[12:43:48] <taplar> does codepen auto run when you change stuff?
[12:44:17] <decx> oh
[12:44:19] <decx> now i see
[12:44:32] <decx> yeah jquery already outputs as a number
[12:44:34] <blakespot> The developers of this system are using JS preselects in other areas all over the place. It does seem the wrong way to go, but I cannot rewrite the system I inherted right now.
[12:44:36] <decx> i think
[12:44:42] <decx> so === string wont do
[12:44:57] <decx> just remove the quotes around the number in the filter
[12:44:57] <blakespot> Difference is they are preselecting whole swaths of same-class options using .each
[12:45:14] <taplar> yeah, that was it
[12:45:23] <blakespot> where I am trying only to preselect a few items within a large pool of similarly-classed items
[12:45:27] <taplar> and use prop("checked", true) instead of triggering the click
[12:45:45] <decx> right
[12:45:47] <decx> both those things
[12:45:49] <blakespot> I simplified the case
[12:45:53] <blakespot> they are nto actually checkboxes
[12:45:59] <taplar> ?
[12:46:13] <taplar> oh, well, so then just remove the ""
[12:46:23] <taplar> and do what evs your heart desires, :)
[12:46:24] <blakespot> the system uses divs that look like large pretty checkboxes that change with images of X and squares - and they have event triggers hanging off the divs looking for a "click"
[12:46:42] <taplar> ah, some bootstrap thing?
[12:46:42] <blakespot> It's a crazy thing really
[12:46:45] <blakespot> yea
[12:46:48] <daslicht> :D
[12:47:04] <blakespot> 40px square "checkboxes" because STYLE
[12:47:07] <blakespot> ...
[12:47:36] <blakespot> Thank you taplar
[12:47:42] <blakespot> It's working
[12:47:52] <taplar> hey, that was decx
[12:47:52] <blakespot> We are abandoning this whole thing in 6 months so
[12:47:59] <blakespot> oh -- decx -- thanks!

[12:49:50] <jquery173> this one sorry
[12:50:05] <jquery173> now I have as return value, true or false
[12:50:48] <jquery173> I have to check when in a quadruplet, there are "" twicw
[12:51:20] <jquery173> I mean, twice true
[12:51:37] <decx> that does nothing
[12:52:08] <decx> what's the point here
[12:52:14] <decx> so oyu have timefields
[12:52:15] <daslicht> he missed importing jquery
[12:52:25] <decx> divs or something with inputs in them
[12:52:34] <decx> what are you doing with only those inputs

[12:53:30] <jquery173> choose first level CCNL - A   CONVIVENTE
[12:53:37] <decx> it'll help you more than us
[12:53:41] <jquery173> in a fiddle? really hard!
[12:54:00] <decx> that's the point of getting better at reducing problems to their core

[12:54:17] <jquery173> not really, follow my instructions

[12:54:29] <daslicht> *cough*
[12:54:29] <taplar> i thought i suggested this yesterday
[12:54:59] <decx> oh you already have the insight here
[12:55:11] <decx> *slowly walks backwards out of the room*
[12:55:20] <taplar> each day has 4 inputs.  he wanted to do something if 2 were blank
[12:55:23] <jquery173> taplar: yesterday we didn't arrive at the check
[12:55:40] <taplar> the if you mean?
[12:55:50] <jquery173> deck: I'm boring taplar from yesterday
[12:56:03] <jquery173> exactly, the if
[12:56:07] <taplar> heh, nah. i was just uncertain how we regressed
[12:56:19] <decx> some canvas fun https://jsfiddle.net/decx/4fdz5j6a/
[12:56:35] <taplar> so you get what it's doing?
[12:57:22] <jquery173> I suppose 99% yes
[12:57:26] <jquery173> just testing
[12:58:25] <taplar> and probably would be better if it was > 1 instead of === 2
[12:58:27] <taplar> i would assume
[12:58:52] <taplar> unless your ac is that specific
[13:00:54] <z1haze> I am trying to load the select2 plugin with require in browserify but im getting select2 is not a function.. Why is it such a pain in the ass load anything jquery related with require
[13:02:20] <jquery173> taplar: it's ok, thank you very much. But, question, why with "map" in the place of "filter", even if the variable is the same, it doesn't work?
[13:04:05] <decx> map and filter are different things
[13:05:01] <jquery173> ok, but the resulting variable blankFieldCount https://jsfiddle.net/1yuv2hx6/3/ is "4" both cases at the end in my project
[13:06:42] <z1haze> can anyone help me get select2 loaded with browserify/require? I dont understand why its telling me select2 is undefined
[13:08:10] <jquery173> decx: sorry, I checked, it was only coincidence of values
[13:08:24] <jquery173> thanks a lot guys and have a nice night!
[14:36:08] <goddard> hey anyone used http://fullcalendar.io/
[14:36:19] <goddard> i was curious what a good way to get the date span from this calender would be
[14:36:28] <goddard> like the first listed date to the last list date?
[14:38:21] <taplar> http://fullcalendar.io/docs/views/View_Object/ ?
[14:42:51] <goddard> taplar: the only problem is i need that data before page load
[14:43:03] <goddard> taplar: so i can use it in my server side code
[14:43:28] <goddard> at least for the first loading
[14:43:45] <goddard> after the month change i can use ajax
[14:44:46] <taplar> uh, kinda confused then. your wanting to use something in server side code, but this is a front end thing
[14:47:15] <z1haze> i am using require to include select2 into my website, but when i try to use it im getting select2 is undefined. I constantly run into issues when using require/browserify with jquery and jquery plugins, can anyone please help me troubleshoot this one
[14:47:18] <goddard> taplar: im confused as well
[14:47:28] <goddard> taplar: quite the problem for me
[14:48:58] <z1haze> how can I check if the plugin is even loading?
[14:50:03] <taplar> try in your console: $.fn.select2
[14:53:27] <taplar> goddard: you might could determine the range programatically.  the calendar appears to show 6 full weeks.  so taking the current month, you can figure out what day the 1st is on and include the previous days until sunday.  And same for the last day of the month, include days until you reach 42 days
[14:54:00] <z1haze> taplar, its undefined.. could you maybe help me figure out whats up with it?
[14:54:32] <taplar> i don't really have any knowledge of the require stuff
[14:54:37] <z1haze> it was working at some point because i checked my live site and its working, but im not sure which commit/change broke it, my live site is quite a bit behind so i cant just roll it back
[14:54:42] <z1haze> oh you dont use require?
[14:54:48] <taplar> nope
[14:54:55] <z1haze> how do you include all of your js?
[14:54:58] <goddard> taplar: that is what i was thinking as well
[14:55:08] <taplar> we include all our scripts
[14:55:13] <z1haze> holy crap
[14:55:21] <z1haze> that could be.. a lot of http requests
[14:55:36] <taplar> well technically it's one script.  our framework merges them
[14:55:58] <z1haze> yea i kinda have that option too but i wanted to use require, stupid me i guess
[14:56:02] <z1haze> you mean, you just concat them all into a file
[14:56:23] <taplar> grails has what it's called an 'asset pipeline' that it uses to build a single js file
[14:56:56] <taplar> you tell it what requires what and it includes them in the order needed in a single file
[14:58:11] <taplar> and even if there were a few files, they'll be cached after the first time, :)
[14:58:41] <robertmaxrees> also: unless you're doinga build step, require still makes a request for each file iirc.
[14:58:59] <z1haze> i build it
[14:59:08] <robertmaxrees> aight
[14:59:21] <robertmaxrees> yeah, require with jquery and plugisn is a beast.
[14:59:25] <z1haze> still it gives me so many headaches, require hates jquery
[14:59:26] <z1haze> yea
[14:59:43] <robertmaxrees> actually jquery can expose a module just fine - it's the plugins that are a problem.
[14:59:49] <z1haze> i have gotten it working with about 10 jquery plugins over a period
[15:00:02] <z1haze> yea the latest jquery is not the problem
[15:00:12] <z1haze> its the plugin as you said, BUT im using select2 and its pretty well maintained
[15:00:26] <z1haze> and i HAD it working, just not sure when/where i broke it
[15:00:29] <robertmaxrees> maintenance has nothing to do with it fwiw.
[15:00:39] <robertmaxrees> it's whether or not it's compatibile with how require does its thing.
[15:00:43] <robertmaxrees> i'd make sure everything validates.
[15:00:45] <taplar> do you use a revisioning repo?  start back tracking
[15:01:04] <z1haze> yea im on a repo, but im kinda lazy, its just me on this project so i dont commit very often
[15:01:27] <robertmaxrees> should be easy to save your current set and compare against the last good one then.
[15:01:46] <z1haze> well i have a 'live' working one
[15:01:57] <robertmaxrees> right, but you should have a known last good commit.
[15:02:02] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, start comparing :)
[15:02:17] <z1haze> yea but ive changed so much i dont wanna revert back
[15:02:25] <robertmaxrees> are you using git?
[15:02:32] <taplar> you can stash your changes
[15:02:35] <robertmaxrees> ^
[15:02:38] <taplar> and/or put them on a different branch
[15:02:41] <robertmaxrees> or create a new branch and ...
[15:02:41] <robertmaxrees> that
[15:06:33] <taplar> but yeah, seriously, commit often.  you don't have to push, but commit is your friend
[15:07:38] <z1haze> yea
[15:07:47] <z1haze> but anyway, can you help me figure out why its not loading?
[15:08:34] <robertmaxrees> i might ask in a require channel?
[15:10:11] <taplar> someone should put some lyrics about git to the tune of "closing time"
[15:10:24] <robertmaxrees> hahahahaha
[15:11:58] <taplar> I doooon't knoooooow.....wheeeeeeeere....i fked this up. (x3) Time toooooo reeeeeeeeeessssseeeeettttt!
[15:12:16] <z1haze> i did ask in browserify this morning
[15:12:29] <z1haze> only crickets
[15:12:39] <shoky> you definitely won't get any help without actually showing the problem/code
[15:13:26] <z1haze> Thats just it, theres not really any code to show..
[15:13:41] <z1haze> require('select2'); ... $('.class').select2()
[15:14:20] <robertmaxrees> you might need to use one of those shims.
[15:17:52] <z1haze> robertmaxrees, i found this earlier: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/30754700/use-select2-version-4-0-with-npm-and-browserify but i didnt understand his solution
[15:18:18] <robertmaxrees> "
[15:18:19] <robertmaxrees> In my package.json I had listed jQuery as a dependancy, however I wa also loading in the bower version of jQuery via the browser: {"jquery: "./bower_components/.../jquery.js"} key.
[15:18:28] <robertmaxrees> make sure you're not loading jquery twice.
[15:18:54] <shoky> z1haze: it's working fine for me
[15:19:08] <z1haze> well thatsw good news, might I see how you set it up?
[15:19:12] <z1haze> I dont know how  id be requyiring it twice
[15:19:22] <robertmaxrees> that page explains how ;)
[15:19:44] <z1haze> I have just var $ = require('jquery'); in my file, then in "browser": { "jquery": "./node_modules/jquery/dist/jquery.min.js",
[15:20:13] <z1haze> and in "browserify-shim": { "jquery": "$"
[15:20:25] <robertmaxrees> are you using bower?
[15:20:31] <z1haze> no, browserify
[15:20:37] <robertmaxrees> (shrug) who knows then,'
[15:20:44] <robertmaxrees> that's what i'd check though.
[15:20:58] <shoky> z1haze:   code.js:  var $ = require('jquery');  require('select2');   $('select').select();
[15:21:06] <shoky> z1haze:  npm install --save jquery select2
[15:21:16] <shoky> z1haze:  browserify code.js > bundle.js
[15:21:38] <z1haze> .select() ?
[15:21:49] <shoky> $('select').select2();
[15:21:52] <shoky> sry
[15:22:04] <z1haze> so you did just the normal setup then, nothing tricky?
[15:22:15] <shoky> why would i do anything tricky? :)
[15:22:15] <z1haze> nothing in browser, or shim?
[15:22:24] <shoky> nope
[15:22:26] <z1haze> because jquery doesnt ever work in browserify/require
[15:22:31] <shoky> sure does
[15:22:32] <z1haze> at leaswt most plugins that is
[15:22:41] <z1haze> jquery is fine, i know but the plugins (most) arent
[15:22:43] <shoky> that's something else
[15:22:50] <shoky> most plugins suck ;p
[15:22:55] <z1haze> well if you're saying select2 is working, its clearly not something else
[15:23:20] <shoky> well only thing that's missing is the css really
[15:23:21] <taplar> "most plugins suck" - shoky 2016
[15:23:38] <shoky> and i guess i can find that under node_modules/select2
[15:23:40] <z1haze> well thats assumed
[15:23:46] <z1haze> you have to include the css haha
[15:23:52] <shoky> yea
[15:24:06] <z1haze> anyway, i cant get it to even load so thats better than mine
[15:24:08] <Velveeta> that's one of the truest gems ever spoken
[15:24:35] <shoky> ;D
[15:25:22] <taplar> it was a thursday when shoky displayed his hatred for the Glade company...
[15:25:53] <z1haze> ok cool
[15:26:10] <z1haze> i commented everything else out except jquery and select2 and its working, so i just have a problem somewhere in here
[15:27:17] <z1haze> i need to learn angular or vue
[15:27:25] <robertmaxrees> nah.
[15:27:27] <robertmaxrees> learn react
[15:28:04] <Velveeta> yes!
[15:28:07] <z1haze> vuejs is the new buzz though
[15:28:13] <shoky> no it's not
[15:28:16] <robertmaxrees> ^ :)
[15:28:18] <shoky> vue is old ;p
[15:28:52] <z1haze> what?
[15:28:52] <z1haze> its new
[15:28:54] <shoky> riot is newer i think, kind of a minimal react ;p
[15:28:59] <robertmaxrees> riot'
[15:29:00] <z1haze> its version 1.x
[15:29:01] <Velveeta> i was told to mock up an entirely new design for our site just using standard html/css, and some minor js, so the designers could get a feel for it before we decided on whatever framework we were gonna use to implement it
[15:29:03] <robertmaxrees> *riot's oooold
[15:29:06] <robertmaxrees> older than react iirc
[15:29:10] <shoky> really?
[15:29:22] <Velveeta> but screw that, it's just as much effort to write the thing in react components and build in real behavior for them to play with
[15:29:50] <robertmaxrees> 2.0 was inspired by react.
[15:29:51] <Velveeta> and if they decide not to go with react in the end, we still have the componentized markup and associated css to migrate to whatever is selected
[15:29:52] <z1haze> you guys dislike angular though?
[15:29:59] <shoky> oh well i mean 2.0 then, yeah
[15:30:08] <robertmaxrees> it's too java-y for my taste.
[15:30:14] <shoky> z1haze: i hate it
[15:30:20] <Velveeta> that's one way of putting it
[15:30:45] <z1haze> hate is a pretty strong opionio
[15:30:53] <z1haze> why do you hate it
[15:30:53] <Velveeta> i also like working with node webservers, and most of the stuff angular builds in to be used entirely on the client, can be shared between the client and server in an express/react setup
[15:31:06] <shoky> so many reasons, i dont wanna even start :S
[15:31:16] <z1haze> ah
[15:31:28] <robertmaxrees> it's trying to make JS something it isn't.
[15:31:31] <z1haze> well ive played a little with vue and its a lot cleaner than angular
[15:31:35] <shoky> but one of the main things is it's a framework
[15:31:41] <shoky> and frameworks suck ;p
[15:31:50] <Velveeta> i like angular's prescriptive DI, but that's about it
[15:32:12] <shoky> yuck :D
[15:32:13] <z1haze> http://vuejs.org/guide/comparison.html pretty cool read
[15:32:18] <z1haze> it might be biased but still
[15:32:38] <z1haze> all of the frameworks you've mentioned on compared here
[15:33:35] <shoky> this is just what the vue developer has to say though..
[15:33:59] <z1haze> thats why i said could be biased
[15:34:10] <z1haze> but facts are still going to be facts, im not talking about his opinions
[15:34:29] <Velveeta> i saw an article a while back that said canjs was the best thing to use because it was the oldest, based on the fact that it came from javascriptmvc, but it also neglected to take any other comparison's roots into account
[15:35:05] <shoky> z1haze:  writing  "Better Performance"  is not a fact ;p
[15:35:18] <z1haze> haha i know
[15:35:25] <z1haze> geez, filter the opinions
[15:35:30] <shoky> okok
[15:36:29] <robertmaxrees> also: this ignores one big point - vue and react (and others) try to solve the problem in different ways.
[15:36:38] <z1haze> i first saw vue probably 6 months ago watching those laracasts videos, but since then it has picked up a ton
[15:36:40] <robertmaxrees> i mean, angular is pretty gross imo, but if it works for you, great.
[15:40:47] <robertmaxrees> aaaah everything is happening
[15:49:28] <taplar> ?
[15:49:57] <robertmaxrees> tomorrow we're rolling everything out.
[15:50:00] <taplar> you could read that as being ecstatic or defeated
[15:50:00] <robertmaxrees> lots of loose ends.
[15:50:10] <taplar> ;)
[15:50:32] <robertmaxrees> sassafrass
[15:50:39] <taplar> sweet, i'll definately have to check it out.  you got me curioso
[15:50:58] <robertmaxrees> all new color scheme and stuff.  and we're doing more in the next few months.
[15:54:41] <vsync_> I have a bunch of <button class="x" value="y"> elements on a page, with different values assigned to them. I have set up jquery so pressing one pops up a dialog, but in the script I need to find a way to fetch the value of the button _that was pressed_
[15:54:54] <robertmaxrees> $(this).val()
[15:55:03] <taplar> or this.value
[15:55:08] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[15:55:11] <taplar> err, it's a button...
[15:55:21] <taplar> guess that's valid
[15:56:31] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/00cfjat4/
[15:56:33] <robertmaxrees> yeah, that works.
[15:57:29] <z1haze> so it seems that there's a conflict somehow between tooltipster, and select2
[15:58:00] <z1haze> if I dont put a browser path for jquery and dont use a shim, select2 works fine, but tooltipster breaks, and visa versa if i use a browser path and shim
[15:59:36] <vsync_> robertmaxrees, taplar, thanks!
[16:00:07] <z1haze> makes no sense
[16:00:39] <z1haze> this works for tooltipster, but breaks the select2 plugin http://dpaste.com/216Z13R
[16:02:28] <z1haze> and this breaks tooltipster i get jquery undefined but select 2 then works... http://dpaste.com/2REAYJJ ideas?
[16:02:42] <vsync_> robertmaxrees: though, here's the code: https://jsfiddle.net/2subLyym/ . So on click I grab the value, but inside the dialog declaration I cannot access the id variable
[16:02:59] <vsync_> no wait...
[16:04:18] <vsync_> I guess I'll have to declare the dialog inside the click trigger, or something?
[16:05:34] <taplar> or move the id variable out into the namespace
[16:06:27] <taplar> mmm, or better
[16:06:41] <vsync_> yes?
[16:07:01] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/2subLyym/1/
[16:07:12] <taplar> something like that
[16:07:13] <z1haze> shoky, can you get select2 and tooltipster to work with browserify?
[16:07:57] <taplar> you wouldn't need the outer var id, i did that mid change
[16:09:31] <vsync_> targetId?
[16:10:04] <taplar> yep, or whatever name you want to give it.  you stick it on the dialog as a data element it can later reference
[16:14:17] <vsync_> Ah, taplar thanks a lot!
[16:22:45] <z1haze> finally, got it working
[16:22:50] <z1haze> not idea why its working but oh well
[16:40:13] <ShaunR> would there be a better way to do this? http://pastebin.com/nX3s3T3M
[16:40:52] <ShaunR> it works, however firebug gives me the following "too much recursion"
[16:44:07] <taplar> i'd put a class on whatever $(this).parent().parent().parent() is
[16:44:36] <taplar> and personally on the labels as well
[16:44:38] <ShaunR> there is, however multiple elements have that class
[17:49:52] <taplar> too much fun in here.  later
[17:49:57] <robertmaxrees> D:
[17:50:02] <taplar> much luck tomorrow rob

[18:00:19] <harry1_> why isn't the data-catnum updated when a selection is made form the drop-down: https://jsfiddle.net/mprx71ca/1/
[18:00:44] <robertmaxrees> it is.
[18:00:48] <robertmaxrees> the attribute in the html isn't.
[18:01:25] <harry1_> can i set the attribute in the html?
[18:01:29] <robertmaxrees> why?
[18:01:45] <robertmaxrees> .data() purposefully doesn't touch the attribute.
[18:01:53] <robertmaxrees> if you want to verify the value, use a console log and .data()
[18:02:02] <harry1_> because i need a var to be set for the next selectino that will be made
[18:02:12] <robertmaxrees> so then read from the .data()
[18:05:29] <harry1_> in my working example I have two drop-down selections, when the first is selected the second drop down is filtered accordingly
[18:05:53] <harry1_> when the second selection is made I need to know the first selection made AND the second
[18:06:13] <robertmaxrees> okay?  i don't understand what that has to do with the attribute updating.
[18:06:44] <harry1_> so surely I need to pass the result of the first selection back to the selections
[18:06:55] <harry1_> storing it as data-catnum
[18:07:01] <harry1_> or bad approach?
[18:07:05] <robertmaxrees> err, that's fine.
[18:07:08] <robertmaxrees> just read it back out.
[18:08:23] <harry1_> that's what I tohught I was doing with $("#StockSuffix").data("catnum","52");
[18:08:30] <robertmaxrees> that sets it, yeah.,
[18:08:51] <harry1_> i don't see the value being updated
[18:10:02] <robertmaxrees> you read it back out with .data()
[18:10:21] <robertmaxrees> .data() caches the value elsewhere.
[18:11:08] <shoky> z1haze still need me to try it?
[18:11:56] <robertmaxrees> harry1_ https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/mprx71ca/2/
[18:21:02] <harry1_> robertmaxrees: thanks I think I had it working, I was using inspect elements but couldn't see the value changing
[18:21:11] <robertmaxrees> right.
[18:21:14] <harry1_> i think you eluded to this in the beginning :0
[18:21:16] <harry1_> )
[18:21:17] <robertmaxrees> because the value doesn't change on the elements :)
[18:21:30] <harry1_> yeah so i see, thought it did
[18:21:36] <robertmaxrees> :) nah.  that's slow.
[18:21:37] <harry1_> is that always the case?
[18:21:40] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[18:21:44] <harry1_> k
[18:21:59] <robertmaxrees> .data() caches on the first interaction because otherwise it's slow.
[18:44:13] <harry1_> is there a quick and easy way to serialize $(this).val() and data-vars on a select
[19:53:25] <nexace> I have an <img> in an <iframe> that is larger than the iframe which causes the horizontal and vertical scrollbars to appear (which is good). how can I make the image able to be dragged and/or zoomed onClick?
[19:53:29] <nexace> zoomed moreso with the mousewheel
[20:05:56] <neanderslob> Just want to check before I re-invent the wheel: does jquery natively support the formatting numbers as currency?
[20:06:31] <blackrose13> hi guys can someone help me with an array problem. http://pastebin.com/x2frNDe8
[20:07:21] <robertmaxrees> neanderslob nope.
[20:07:37] <robertmaxrees> blackrose13 where's the array?
[20:07:48] <neanderslob> robertmaxrees: cool; thanks
[20:08:00] <robertmaxrees> blackrose13 alternatively, can you just make a fiddle of your problem?
[20:08:00] <blackrose13> its allElements
[20:08:27] <blackrose13> all though i think it probably a bad way of doing it? basically im tryng to get all the combination of classes n then get only that element
[20:08:41] <blackrose13> fiddle
[20:08:42] <robertmaxrees> "basically im tryng to get all the combination of classes n then get only that element"
[20:08:44] <blackrose13> ok got it
[20:08:47] <robertmaxrees> that's what i'm lost on.
[20:09:06] <blackrose13> let me do a fiddle
[20:09:12] <robertmaxrees> awesome.
[20:40:43] <blackrose13> hi can someone helop me with this https://jsfiddle.net/xff8LuLk/1/
[20:50:44] <z1haze> shoky, if you dont mind.
[21:04:01] <blackrose13> https://jsfiddle.net/xff8LuLk/2/ how do i get only the duplicate values
[21:10:20] <shoky> z1haze: tooltipster doesn't export an npm module, it needs a global jQuery :|
[21:10:43] <z1haze> right, so how do i make them all work
[21:10:59] <z1haze> i read up on exposing jquery to make it global, which makes the tooltip work
[21:11:04] <z1haze> but then select2 doesnt work
[21:14:05] <shoky> z1haze:  var $ = require('jquery'); require('select2'); window.jQuery = $; require('tooltipster');  $().select2();  $().tooltipster();
[21:14:09] <shoky> works for me
[21:14:40] <z1haze> hmm
[21:14:49] <z1haze> ill give that a shot.. again nothing in your package.json?
[21:16:10] <z1haze> when do you have to set variables for the things you require, and when dont you?
[21:17:33] <z1haze> previously i had window.jQuery = window.$ = require('jquery'); which seemed to work but it is hacky, right?
[21:18:48] <shoky> that sets window.$ which is unnecessary (and maybe causes your problems no idea), and it doesn't set a local $ variabe
[21:18:56] <shoky> so i prefer mine ;p
[21:19:02] <shoky> and nothing in my package.json
[21:20:28] <z1haze> ok thank you
[21:21:06] <shoky> i can't promise that adding more and more plugins will continue to work :P
[21:21:25] <shoky> unless they all properly export a module
[21:28:48] <z1haze> yea i know
[21:28:52] <z1haze> ive been fighting this battle
[21:29:09] <z1haze> when you require in your modules, etc do you tend to require them all at the time, or require them where you call them?
[21:29:15] <z1haze> or hwere you 'use' them
[21:29:55] <shoky> not sure what you mean
[21:30:10] <shoky> i require them in the files that need them
[21:30:43] <z1haze> for now, in my app.js file i have all my requires at the top of the file.. then do all my calls in the file somewhere.. im asking do you do that or do you include one at a time, write the js to use it, then require the next one ,etc
[21:31:04] <shoky> requires at the top
[21:36:31] <blackrose13> there a problem getting the duplicate items, is there a better way of doing it? https://jsfiddle.net/xff8LuLk/6/
[21:44:30] <Chris____> is ben here?
