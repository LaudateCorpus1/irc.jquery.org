[00:48:07] <sonu_nk> hi. i am adding css !important using $("#frmb-0-stage-wrap").css("cssText", "border-radius:"+$(this).val()+"px !important"); but it is removing my pre defined inline style.
[00:48:30] <sonu_nk> Is there any way to keep pre defined style and add this !important ?
[00:51:34] <sonu_nk> i did this $("#frmb-0-stage-wrap").css("cssText", $("#frmb-0-stage-wrap").attr("style")+" border-radius:"+$(this).val()+"px !important");
[00:51:39] <sonu_nk> and it seems working..
[00:51:44] <sonu_nk> is i am doing right ?
[02:03:38] <Cork> Sonderblade: !important has no effect in style attributes, so you can't use it with jquery
[02:04:27] <Cork> Sonderblade: also if you need to use !important it normally mean you have structured your css wrong
[05:01:32] <R13ose> Hi
[05:05:07] <rominronin> hello. my brief is to add 2 simple animations to a complete 4-pager site. I'm reluctant to add any bulky libraries unnecessarily, yet I seem to remember that standard jquery animations utilise the position attribute, and so produce lower fps animations. Is this still correct? Should I just use css3 animations, or should I just submit to the ease of an animation library? Feedback is welcomed and appreciated
[05:06:12] <rominronin> i say 2 simple animations, there is a cityscape that comprises 11 svgs that ideally should be individually animated.
[05:24:57] <fieldmapper`> Hi there, I would like to add tooltip to all img in my html file showing the src. What's the easiest to do?
[05:43:01] <R13ose> How do I wi
[05:44:15] <R13ose> What do I use instead of window.addeventlistener?
[06:04:05] <IamTrying> Does anyone know this mystery? I gave up finally it was a worst nightmare of constant 6 month and finally project was dead/kicked out. 1) in a call center environment $.post $.get was used using setTimeout(function() {} , 3000); 2) from time to time call center execute some other additional $.post or $.get submission 3) now the problem was point 2 could not submit some attempts to the cloud
[06:04:40] <IamTrying> i could not find that issue with Chromium, Google chrome and finally i was kicked out. Still wondering what was that cause that point 2 jQuery let me down?
[06:05:07] <IamTrying> does jQuery fail to submit $.post or $.get when there is some other $.post or $.get instances were happening?
[06:07:31] <IamTrying> or was it Gooogle chrome / Chromium who refuse tooo many $.post, $.get submissions?
[06:18:25] <IamTrying> http://paste.ubuntu.com/24124219/ - for example here line 17 fails to submit the request to the server out of 100 maybe 95 times success but 5 attempts never received to the server?
[06:49:45] <Cork> IamTrying: browsers has limitations on how many connections are allowed to the same domain at the same time (to prevent ddos)
[06:50:20] <Cork> so ya, you normally want to limit the connection to around 5-10 connections at a time, never more
[07:56:18] <helvetet> When using data-function="functionName()" can you trigger it without using eval or without having to put the whole function there?
[08:00:00] <helvetet> might aswell use eval
[08:15:48] <IamTrying> Cork: Guru that explain everything why it was not working. Was it in recent browsers version or since begin?
[08:16:22] <Cork> IamTrying: since for ever, they are slowly loosening the limits through
[08:16:43] <Cork> from the beginning it was 2 connections per domain, around 2010 it was raised to 9
[08:16:55] <Cork> and i think they have raised it one more time since (or more)
[08:17:04] <Cork> also it might differ a bit between browsers
[08:17:26] <Cork> helvetet: yes you can, just remove the ()
[08:17:35] <Cork> and use the function as a lookup for the function
[08:17:55] <Cork> ex. myMethods[$(this).data('functionname')(args);
[08:17:58] <Cork> opps
[08:18:03] <Cork> ex. myMethods[$(this).data('functionname')](args);
[08:18:25] <IamTrying> Guru Cork, can you see if this make sense 1 connection i had for permanent crawl, 2nd connection i had when call center person submits somthing, 3rd connection is WebRTC audio/video sockets. So i was actually crossing the socket limitation you think? which caused that rejection often.
[08:18:54] <helvetet> Cork:  yeah i ended up doing that instead
[08:19:05] <Cork> IamTrying: if you only ever use those three at the same time no that should be fine
[08:19:09] <helvetet> thanks anyways!
[08:19:31] <IamTrying> Cork: when that happend i noticed it shows in Google chrome something like "Staled" or so
[08:19:40] <Cork> helvetet: sidenote, if you ever want to enable csp on the site you will have to avoid eval
[08:19:54] <helvetet> ah okay
[08:20:16] <Cork> while the methods[] is fine
[08:20:39] <helvetet> i just didnt want to move all the functions to the array because lazy
[08:20:41] <helvetet> but i did it anwyays
[08:20:42] <Cork> IamTrying: donno, can't say i've ever seen that one
[08:21:00] <Cork> helvetet: uh, i hope you used an object and not an array
[08:21:03] <Cork> cause else... ugg
[08:21:07] <helvetet> i used a object
[08:21:11] <Cork> good
[08:21:31] <Cork> method[38576512](random, args) :D
[08:21:38] <helvetet> haha yeah
[08:21:42] <Cork> yay for debugging that
[08:22:03] <IamTrying> Guru Cork you are great. let me share you,  then you might know exact illness of that issue. i twas horrible/terrible even my senior enterprise network team gave up. which you just now solved lol
[08:22:58] <IamTrying> cant find that english word its called "Staled or so" In google chrome network tab console searching...
[08:23:22] <Cork> halted?
[08:23:25] <Cork> aborted?
[08:23:33] <IamTrying> https://i.stack.imgur.com/qFDtX.png - guru here is the Google chrome word shows when it happend Cork
[08:23:45] <Cork> IamTrying: also please drop the guru...
[08:24:07] <Cork> IamTrying: that prob just means it is delayed
[08:24:29] <Cork> it should be called when there are open connections over for the browser
[08:24:45] <Cork> they connections shouldn't vanish as long as the timeout isn't very short
[08:24:46] <IamTrying> Cork: if that is true, then why server never ever received that packet? ( i was 500% sure when i missed that packet i saw STalled in google chrome)
[08:25:19] <Cork> what should happen when is when you fire more connections then the browser allow it will throttle the connections
[08:25:20] <helvetet> proxy?
[08:25:27] <Cork> but the connection should still go through
[08:26:44] <Cork> ah, interesting
[08:26:55] <Cork> chrome has a max of 6 connections
[08:27:12] <IamTrying> http://i.imgur.com/ylqp3FN.png - Cork this is the CORRECT image of my last failure when i was debugging.
[08:27:25] <Cork> IamTrying: btw remember that loading images and videos and html and so on is counted in that limit
[08:27:52] <Cork> failure?
[08:27:57] <Cork> that one didn't stall at all
[08:28:12] <Cork> if you still had the problem then the stalling isn't the problem
[08:28:20] <IamTrying> Cork: YES - when you see that screenshot that is the moment i never receive anything to the server
[08:28:39] <Cork> then the information isn't related to stalling
[08:28:46] <Cork> uh... problem i meant
[08:28:47] <IamTrying> Cork: i have that problem still. And i am trying to fight back with them in the ring.
[08:29:19] <Cork> i would say try to reproduce it with curl or something like that
[08:29:34] <Cork> reduce the thickness of the stack your trying to debug
[08:29:41] <Cork> make sure the problem is browser related at all
[08:29:54] <IamTrying> Cork: how can i prove its not jQuery but its there shitty network maybe? Cork, there network engineers sit with me side by side and proved me wrong by showing curl and network ping works
[08:30:05] <Cork> IamTrying: i just answered that
[08:30:36] <Cork> wireshark might be another good choice
[08:30:48] <MikeD_> ping typically uses packets of only 32 bytes, you see problems with full packets
[08:30:56] <Cork> if you can log the request going from your computer, but never reach the server you have quite a lot of proof
[08:31:43] <IamTrying> Cork: I have done the tcpdump and wireshark with there network admin onsite. They proved me and failed me like knocked out. Google chrome never / ever sended out that bytes/bit at all over the network
[08:31:44] <MikeD_> I saw that back in the day with a mismatch in the network frame sizes on either ends of the WAN
[08:32:01] <IamTrying> so i was like knocked out is it jQuery or Chrome cause they dont find any bit/bytes on the network Cork
[08:32:33] <MikeD_> oh, nm.. no data is a different issue
[08:32:35] <Cork> IamTrying: in that case it sounds like it might be time to look harder at the js
[08:32:57] <Cork> IamTrying: for the connections that give no data you should get an error in the fail handler
[08:33:10] <Cork> connections very rarely goes away without notifying you at all
[08:33:26] <Cork> (though it does happen, but then you normally get a hung connection)
[08:34:08] <IamTrying> Cork: believe me. it was horrible one. i could not find who was the culprit. but at-least i have the prove that google chrome keep telling me that "Stalled"
[08:34:19] <IamTrying> Cork:  which means either the JS or something in the Browser.
[08:34:27] <IamTrying> cause network specialist could not see a single bit/bytes passing
[08:34:32] <IamTrying> when that Stalled state occured.
[08:36:17] <Cork> IamTrying: don't stare so much at the other parties
[08:36:32] <Cork> start by making sure you grab all the error states you can in the code you have
[08:36:38] <Cork> and start working down from there
[08:36:53] <Cork> don't assume it is the network or browser cause something isn't working
[08:39:08] <IamTrying> Cork: back to the drawing board. the application is using a permanent crawling to get some status via $.get, while having WebRTC call connected means lot of sockets already being used by the browser core. now while being in the call Agent clicks a button to write report , that submission never received or sometimes received. When never received Google chrome clearly state "Stalled" status. Means 1) Google chrom
[08:39:08] <IamTrying> e is angry cause too many sockets were used? 2) jQuery unknown bug? that not allowing more $.get or $.post traffic for some reason...
[08:39:54] <Cork> IamTrying: don't blame everything other then your own code...
[08:40:03] <IamTrying> Right.
[08:40:03] <Cork> start by debugging your own code
[08:40:25] <IamTrying> I cant simulate that issue in my local network. only that happens in there customer onsite network Cork
[09:01:08] <nandha> Hi
[09:50:27] <R13ose> Hi
[09:53:37] <R13ose> How do I make sure this code is using for when an audio html5 player is clicked?  Code: http://pastebin.com/FTCdr84W
[10:05:15] <Cork> hmm does play events bubble...
[10:06:10] <Cork> R13ose: you might have to bind the event on the audio element not the window element
[10:06:16] <Cork> cause i don't think it bubbles there
[10:06:25] <Cork> you might be able to bind it on document
[10:10:31] <R13ose> Cork: right but line 2 is my problem as I don't understand if that is correct
[10:15:18] <R13ose> Cork: what do you think?
[10:21:52] <OnceMe> if I access dom element via id, can I somehow cast it to the object it was?
[10:29:26] <R13ose> Here is updated code: http://pastebin.com/yAEfrh3m
[11:06:13] <Deusdeorum> can a $(document).on('click', 'body *', function() { be triggered through an email lol?
[11:07:27] <taplar> you mean an email that has html in it?
[11:08:23] <Deusdeorum> very weird, using a survey system which sends out specific links, on the first page in that survey system there's a "$(document).on('click', 'body *', function() {}" script
[11:09:00] <shoky_> it'll be triggered by clicks, not emails :)
[11:09:10] <Deusdeorum> so weird lol
[11:09:28] <Deusdeorum> can company have some kind of spam filter that check links?
[11:09:47] <shoky_> spam filter is not something you do in the browser ;p
[11:10:11] <shoky_> one would hope
[11:10:39] <Deusdeorum> weird, all links is marked as incomplete, they get marked as incomplete first when someone enter the survey and is incomplete until they submit a full answer.
[11:11:20] <shoky_> we have no idea what you're talking about. no such thing, generally, as an "incomplete" link
[11:11:44] <Deusdeorum> nah very weird and specific question.
[11:11:55] <shoky_> vague, mostly
[11:12:27] <Deusdeorum> but just to clear things out. "$(document).on('click', 'body *', function() {" will get triggered if and only if someone click on the body right?
[11:12:44] <shoky_> if someone clicks on an element inside body, yes
[11:13:07] <shoky_> assuming no other event handler stops the event propagation in the middle
[11:28:26] <R13ose> Should I ask my question again?
[11:28:56] <taplar> go for it
[11:32:05] <R13ose> I am trying to make an audio tag stops if another one starts, my code is not doing anything at the moment.  Here is updated code: http://pastebin.com/TPZgQAn2
[11:33:07] <taplar> tag names are lowercase iirc
[11:33:26] <taplar> quick console log will let you know
[11:33:55] <shoky_> nah uppercase
[11:34:10] <shoky_> what's `addEventListener` tho?
[11:34:14] <taplar> woah
[11:36:08] <R13ose> Is the first line correct?
[11:36:33] <shoky_> not sure <audio> elements have 'click' events..
[11:36:54] <R13ose> https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_document_addeventlistener.asp
[11:37:07] <shoky_> R13ose: you're not calling addEventListener on any element..
[11:37:14] <shoky_> there is no global `addEventListener`
[11:37:33] <shoky_> but.. put console logs in your code to see if it's even running
[11:37:45] <shoky_> don't think you can catch click events on audio like that..
[11:38:32] <taplar> true, why not bind to play on the top level?
[11:38:57] <R13ose> shoky_: should I do console.log() and put something in there, but what?
[11:39:04] <R13ose> taplar: how?
[11:39:07] <shoky_> R13ose: console.log('hi')  works
[11:39:34] <taplar> same as you are with click, but it would be play instead.
[11:40:14] <R13ose> Trying both
[11:40:33] <taplar> though that's most likely not enough for a full case, as a user could also pause or stop the audio themselves.  or it could play out and sto
[11:40:34] <taplar> *p
[11:40:44] <taplar> surely there is a way to check audio state?
[11:41:23] <R13ose> yep surely
[11:41:52] <taplar> ?
[11:43:28] <R13ose> Nothing is happening.
[11:44:43] <R13ose> What else should I do?
[11:46:34] <taplar> where did you put the console.log?  and make sure you don't have any console errors
[11:47:46] <R13ose> taplar: after the first line.  No console errors.
[11:48:17] <taplar> and did you try changing the first like to bind on play instead?
[11:48:22] <taplar> like/line
[11:48:54] <R13ose> Change the word click to play?
[11:48:59] <taplar> yes
[11:49:22] <taplar> $(selector).bind(event, eventHandler)
[11:50:39] <R13ose> I did that and nothing happened.  I am not sure the selector is correct
[11:50:59] <taplar> console.log($(selector).length); on the first line and see what that prints out
[11:58:05] <R13ose> taplar: nothing
[11:59:12] <taplar> nothing printed or you got 0 ?
[12:00:07] <R13ose> One sec trying again
[12:00:50] <taplar> also for reference: http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide1
[12:04:20] <R13ose> taplar: nothing shows up
[12:05:24] <taplar> that would seem to say then that either the script is not running or you have your javascript logging disabled
[12:10:10] <R13ose> Right
[12:15:36] <R13ose> Now I get ReferenceError: $ is not defined
[12:16:03] <taplar> you have to include jquery before any script that depends upon it
[12:18:10] <taplar> also take a look at that website i linked.  it has good pointers for starting to debug javascript
[12:18:30] <R13ose> Yep saw
[12:18:35] <hlve> So, if I wanted this function to check if event.origin includes any subdomains of domains listed in the okOrigins array, how would I modify this? http://pastebin.com/AjmfsWpD
[12:19:24] <hlve> currently, it's only allowing the domain, no subdomains
[12:19:42] <taplar> sub.domain or domain/sub?
[12:19:46] <hlve> sub.domain
[12:20:02] <hlve> indexof should've caught that, no?
[12:20:13] <taplar> might be 0
[12:20:50] <taplar> really what your after is an endsWith, with at least 2 characters before it, the first being a .
[12:22:24] <taplar> some regex might be the approach to take.  not sure an endsWith exists natively
[12:24:31] <hlve> I'm surprised there wouldn't be a catchall method that I could check from event.origin..
[12:39:20] <MikeD_> isn't "endsWith" the $ anchor?
[12:39:56] <MikeD_> sorry, i saw "regex" and "endsWith" ... didn't go back for more context
[12:40:21] <hlve> Still stuck <,<
[12:41:17] <MikeD_> i can't get to pastebin, but I'll take a look if you repaste somewhere that's not proxyblocked
[12:41:28] <hlve> So, if I wanted this function to check if event.origin includes any subdomains of domains listed in the okOrigins array, how would I modify this? http://pastebin.com/AjmfsWpD
[12:41:31] <hlve> Ah
[12:41:33] <hlve> One sec.
[12:41:41] <hlve> where else can I post it?
[12:41:44] <Juinn> hey guys anyone about please?
[12:41:47] <MikeD_> jsfiddle?
[12:41:58] <Juinn> i need help with promise
[12:42:07] <hlve> https://jsfiddle.net/4gb9zhsm/ @MikeD_
[12:42:23] <MikeD_> !ask @ Juinn
[12:42:40] <hlve> that isn't catching subdomains, just the domain... which causes issues with CORS <_<
[12:43:12] <MikeD_> can you chop the subdomain parts before you test?
[12:43:58] <MikeD_> though you're likely to have similar problems with the CORS part next, right?
[12:44:23] <hlve> no. if I add test.domaina.com to the OkDomains, it's fine
[12:44:59] <MikeD_> myevilhosting.yourdomain.com might be a thing that got delegated.. if you say it's ok because yourdomain.com is "ok" then I can do bad stuff?
[12:45:06] <Juinn> mike i made a editable table plugin...which has save and delete custom callbacks....line 83 is the save function of the plugin and where the deferred is initiated...then line 333 (the custom callback) is where im trying to get the promise to work
[12:45:08] <MikeD_> or am I overengineering?
[12:45:18] <Juinn> MikeD_: https://jsfiddle.net/evtxmg1L/
[12:45:25] <Juinn> please read above ^^
[12:45:28] <Juinn> thank you
[12:46:06] <hlve> MikeD_, basically, yes.  I'm using a postmessage for a parent iframe under the same domain, but from a different subdomain.
[12:46:51] <MikeD_> hlve: then you could remove the subdomain before you check pretty easily, right?
[12:47:02] <hlve> yep
[12:47:36] <hlve> Ah I see what you're saying
[12:47:50] <hlve> though, how would I do that with an array of URLs?
[12:48:23] <MikeD_> the only value you want to strip is the one you're testing
[12:50:30] <MikeD_> https://jsfiddle.net/4gb9zhsm/1/
[12:50:42] <MikeD_> whatever way you want to 'removeSubdomain'
[12:51:22] <Juinn> MikeD_: it seems i needed to put deferred.resolve(); on success
[12:51:57] <hlve> MikeD_, missing the function for removeSubdomain, no?
[12:52:25] <hlve> ahh I see what you meant ;p
[12:52:51] <Juinn> deferred.resolve();   will trigger   deferred.done(function(){});    now do i trigger deferred fail ?
[12:53:40] <taplar> resolve -> success, reject -> fail
[12:55:34] <MikeD_> hlve: yeah, i didn't want to write an embarrassingly convoluted string manipulation to confuse the point
[12:55:44] <hlve> i got it, I think. I'll let you know :P
[12:55:47] <hlve> Thanks for the help
[12:57:23] <R13ose> taplar: this loads the file but I need to figure out the rest of the code
[12:57:35] <JoyceM> If I want to change my iframes src through jquery, would this be the correct way to go about it?     $(iframe).attr("src", iframe.data("src"));
[12:58:33] <MikeD_> not sure why you'd have a data property of 'src'
[12:58:48] <dglambert> yo
[12:59:24] <JoyceM> Is it not considered a dataproperty?
[12:59:46] <MikeD_> if you didn't specifically set it, then it's not there
[13:00:07] <JoyceM> my iframe is set as "<iframe src=""> </iframe>
[13:00:29] <MikeD_> caveat:  data-foo attributes are automagically convered to .data() elements, but certainly won't have "src" from the src attribute
[13:01:25] <MikeD_> but that's the only part of the statement that i'd ask about
[13:02:01] <JoyceM> Would something like this work better?  $(iframe).attr("src", "url");
[13:02:10] <MikeD_> have you tried using a hardcoded value as the second parameter to proof of concept the change works?
[13:02:50] <JoyceM> Well it wasn't working on the first one so I wasn't sure if it was a syntax thing, but it wasn't throwing any errors
[13:02:51] <MikeD_> $(iframe).attr("src", "http://jsfiddle.net");
[13:03:03] <JoyceM> MikeD: Awesome, thanks for your help!
[13:03:17] <MikeD_> that's just a test to see if the attribute assignment works
[13:03:34] <MikeD_> then you can replace the hardcoded string with a variable
[13:04:29] <JoyceM> Oh, yeah I tested it like that, it still just shows "<iframe src></iframe>" in my html, so I don't think that worked
[13:06:18] <MikeD_> try replacing .attr() with .prop()
[13:06:46] <JoyceM> I just alerted my iframe var, and am getting object Object back, so I think it has something to do with that
[13:07:01] <MikeD_> as a general rule, I only use .attr() on things before they're attached to the DOM, then use .prop()
[13:08:06] <JoyceM> Yeah, my iframe var is:   var iframe = $(h + "iframe");  So i think that is messing something up
[13:08:22] <R13ose> taplar: still around?
[13:08:31] <taplar> yup, eating some lunch
[13:11:10] <R13ose> taplar: well when you have time, my code now says $_currentlyPlaying is not defined
[13:12:22] <taplar> where are you defining it?
[13:13:42] <R13ose> taplar: I am not but thought this was part of html5 audio
[13:14:06] <JoyceM> MikeD: so what would be causing my statement   console.log(iframe); to return [object Object] ?
[13:14:37] <hlve> MikeD_, why am I hitting this exception? https://jsfiddle.net/4gb9zhsm/4/
[13:14:41] <hlve> >:
[13:14:58] <taplar> ? you thought an html5 object would create javascript variables?
[13:15:40] <JoyceM> taplar: I can't create a variable based on an iframe?
[13:16:34] <taplar> sure, but the element itself doesn't -do- that.  you have to code it
[13:16:34] <taplar> but my statement was to R13ose, not you
[13:17:13] <JoyceM> Ah, oops my mistake! But yeah, I think I have it coded in correctly
[13:17:45] <hlve> nvm got it
[13:17:52] <taplar> JoyceM: what do you get if you log iframe.html() ?
[13:18:07] <R13ose> taplar: I was using window. before in a lot of places and was working but removed them as that was causing the code to work all the time.
[13:18:53] <taplar> R13ose: you probably have a scope issue then
[13:20:09] <R13ose> taplar: if I put window. back in, you think with the new code this will work?  Do you want to see the current code with window. in it?
[13:20:32] <JoyceM> So, this is what I'm working with: https://jsfiddle.net/vxvcba76/  Using 'h' I want to return the href of the a tag that is clicked, and then target in iframe in a div with an id of that same href
[13:21:27] <taplar> personally i'd avoid putting variables on window as that makes them entirely global
[13:21:27] <taplar> you just need to scope them at a level that they are accessable by any nested logic that needs them
[13:22:57] <taplar> JoyceM: what is h?
[13:23:39] <R13ose> Oh no left
[13:27:42] <MikeD_> hlve: https://jsfiddle.net/4gb9zhsm/5/
[13:27:47] <taplar> sorry, got dc'ed
[13:27:56] <R13ose> taplar: new code: http://pastebin.com/QZMvN6yu
[13:28:08] <JoyceM> taplar: h is the 'href' of the a tag that is being clicked, for instance <a href="#btn2">
[13:28:27] <hlve> MikeD_, ahhh. Thank you!
[13:28:28] <taplar> ok, and #btn2iframe is a valid selector?
[13:28:40] <R13ose> taplar: maybe I need to use document instead of window
[13:28:43] <MikeD_> is that regex clear to you?
[13:28:48] <JoyceM> nope, I need #btn2 iframe
[13:29:00] <taplar> so i think you are missing a space, no?
[13:29:09] <JoyceM> Yep, makes sense!
[13:29:55] <taplar> ok, R13ose, you are going to have an issue with the logic because you are binding a play handler inside another handler
[13:30:02] <taplar> you don't want to do this.  you should only bind once
[13:30:40] <hlve> yes. that's better than what I had. I was hiccuping somewhere.
[13:30:53] <taplar> also you're kinda mixing how you do bindings.  your doing one with jquery and another with vanilla
[13:31:11] <R13ose> taplar: vanilla?
[13:31:24] <taplar> normal javascript
[13:31:26] <hlve> R13ose, vanilla = pure js. non-jquery
[13:31:33] <JoyceM> taplar: Works great! Thank you :)
[13:31:43] <taplar> JoyceM: cool
[13:32:18] <R13ose> Well, I want to use jquery all the way
[13:32:45] <MikeD_> hlve:  idk what I was thinking, use this instead:    var testdomain = (event.origin).match(/[^\.]*\.[^.]*$/)[0];
[13:33:10] <MikeD_> not a dot*, a dot, not a dot*, end of string
[13:33:37] <hlve> i wish regex less complex :P
[13:33:43] <hlve> I wish I knew regex better.*
[13:34:10] <MikeD_> even those who know regex better with they knew regex better
[13:34:21] <MikeD_> s/with/wish
[13:34:31] <R13ose> taplar: how do I do that?
[13:34:36] <taplar> one sec
[13:34:41] <MikeD_> (you see what I did there?) :P
[13:36:07] <hlve> It's saying that the property of 0 is null.
[13:36:17] <hlve> not on the fiddle, but in live code.
[13:37:21] <MikeD_> if you don't have a match, it won't have an array element 0
[13:38:13] <MikeD_> that's the bad part about assuming array position zero is 'the thing I want' - you have to guard against the array not existing
[13:39:01] <taplar> R13ose: https://jsfiddle.net/rfk3md36/  see what you think of that
[13:41:37] <MikeD_> hlve: here's a hacky way to go: var testdomain = ((event.origin).match(/[^\.]*\.[^.]*$/) || [])[0];
[13:42:03] <hlve> why is that considered hacky?
[13:42:11] <R13ose> taplar: the first if statement has nothing in the first part, why?
[13:42:12] <MikeD_> i imagine your real code could more readably do the same checks
[13:42:24] <taplar> cause i'm not writing the whole solution for you, :P
[13:44:14] <MikeD_> i updated again: https://jsfiddle.net/4gb9zhsm/6/
[13:44:48] <R13ose> taplar: I get that.  I will try and see where I get
[13:46:04] <MikeD_> fwiw - if you're going to run stuff repeatedly with console.log() put console.clear() at the start of your test - i always forget that's an option
[13:46:23] <MikeD_> ... been hitting the trashcan/clear button manually like a moron
[13:48:47] <Alturic> Hey guys, I have 6 different input elements, one of them being disabled by default. I'm looking to remove the disabled attr when the other 5 all have a .val() associated with them. I'll admit I'm new to jQuery but I'm unsure if the proper approach would be to write a checkStatus function that fires anytime one of the 5 .keyup's occur and inside of the checkStatus it's basically a if statement
[13:48:47] <Alturic> checking if each of the 5 inputs have values or if not?
[13:50:04] <MikeD_> if your selector includes ":checked" you can simply use the .count
[13:50:15] <MikeD_> er  length
[13:50:23] <Alturic> 3 are selects, 2 are inputs.
[13:51:50] <MikeD_> then you're probably doing it manually :)
[13:51:56] <Alturic> So, again I'm new, go easy on me... the selects I currently do something like  if ($('#selectOne').val() <= '0') { //doSomething }
[13:52:26] <taplar> the value of your selects are numbers?
[13:53:05] <Alturic> So inside of the "checkStatus" function, I'd essentially do if ( ($('#selectOne').val() <= '0') && ($('#selectTwo').val() <= '0') ) { //removeAttr('disabled') }
[13:53:19] <Alturic> I'm just unsure if that's proper/smart/logical or not. :-/
[13:53:28] <Alturic> taplar, yes all numbers.
[13:53:51] <Alturic> Even the inputs only accept numbers.
[13:53:55] <taplar> what's the no selection number?
[13:54:04] <Alturic> blank
[13:54:34] <Alturic> <option value=""></option>
[13:54:44] <taplar> in that case, select all the inputs that should be set, filter on those that do not have a trimmed string length, and remove the disabled prop if there are 0 of them
[13:55:32] <taplar> http://api.jquery.com/filter/#filter-function
[14:10:10] <Darmani> Hi everyone! How do I get the data out of a serialized string?
[14:10:10] <Darmani> https://gist.github.com/mfifth/8af1465fb8abdcbad2f6573f38ac91b4
[14:10:25] <Darmani> I need to create a link with some serialized data but I'm not exactly sure how to access it.
[14:16:25] <taplar> why not $('#weekly-pitch-count').find() what you need?
[14:16:27] <Alturic> taplar: This   $( "#containerDivFiveInputs" ).find(".form-control").filter(function() { return this.value } )   looks like it returns any of the 5 elements that have values filles out for them. I'm questioning myself about it, since you made mention of "trimmed string length" however.
[14:17:03] <taplar> Alturic: yeah you can this.value.trim().length === 0 to get the ones without a value
[14:19:53] <Alturic> Alright, so yea I added what you just used and it's returning the ones that don't have values so far, so good. So, I would put this entire line as a single condition if statement which would remove the disabled property on that 6th element?
[14:20:10] <taplar> if the .length > 0
[14:20:17] <Alturic> Right.
[14:20:48] <Alturic> And then I would put that if statement then into a checkStatus function that fires on any of the 5 elements .change or .keyup depending on if they are selects or inputs?
[14:20:57] <taplar> yep
[14:21:01] <Alturic> Interesting.
[14:21:23] <taplar> you should probably do 'keyup change'
[14:21:27] <Alturic> So, while I love learning, just to be clear, the real thing this did was remove redundancy of a massive single if statement, correct?
[14:21:36] <taplar> users could paste into an input with just their mouse
[14:21:49] <taplar> pretty much.  it does the looping for you
[14:21:54] <Alturic> Oh, I figured inputs were only .keyup (I mean I know there's keydown, but yea), and then selects would only ever be .change.
[14:22:05] <taplar> nah, inputs have a few events
[14:22:35] <taplar> 'change' happens on any input when the value changes (by the user) and then the input loses focus
[14:23:02] <Alturic> Well, I meant from a "select only changes", you dont "keyup on a select". More-so real-world logic versus jQuery logic.
[14:23:15] <taplar> you could have a key up on a select too
[14:23:20] <taplar> think of hitting up and down arrows
[14:23:56] <Alturic> Oh man, that's a change. Grr, guess the docs would explain that. I suppose what "real-world" would be in terms of "fire this when a value is 'set'" would be something with focus.
[14:24:13] <Alturic> That's when I ultimately what to fire the select anyway, when a value is actually... selected.
[14:25:12] <Alturic> Well, thank you so much for your help, I'll look into those more than thinking they mean what the actual definition of the word means. :P
[14:25:20] <taplar> :)
[14:32:33] <MikeD_> regarding framework features:  "if a little dog from Kansas can expose the magic, it probably wasn't really magic"
[14:32:51] <taplar> lol, what?
[14:34:49] <MikeD_> we have a custom framework that really isn't much more than a wrapper (with no real documentation) around jquery, so when there are problems with how it works the end result is "what does jquery do?"
[14:35:20] <MikeD_> and the first part is just a reference to Dorthy's "little dog" pulling the back the curtain on the Wizard of Oz
[14:36:24] <taplar> heh
[16:26:05] <SpecialTech> https://jsfiddle.net/angqqom1/ - is there a reason why the keyup is not finding the element? I'm trying to do some UI validation, the actual validation is done server side. In all reality, it's just checking to see if the selects are selected, and then display a button.
[16:27:17] <tsukasadt> Is it possible to use var ele = $('<span></span>').css({ ... }) as a template to add multiple elements with a dynamic .html(), or do I have to declare it everywhere it's used? I ask because the same element is being added to all instances of a class with dynamic content, except the final instance with uses a different .html() value.
[16:27:58] <MikeD_> SpecialTech: are you using a key?
[16:28:07] <taplar> tsukasadt: you can use an element as a template, but at some point you will want to clone it before applying differences
[16:28:23] <tsukasadt> taplar, How would I clone it?
[16:28:36] <taplar> $thing.clone()
[16:28:44] <tsukasadt> ty
[16:29:36] <taplar> SpecialTech: are you using your arrow keys to make the keyup happen?
[16:29:43] <taplar> cause a mouse does not trigger 'keyup'
[16:30:11] <tsukasadt> taplar, That worked perfectly! All I had to do was add the .clone() to my .each() and worked. tyvm :D
[16:30:21] <taplar> sure
[16:30:26] <MikeD_> not sure you really mean this either: https://jsfiddle.net/angqqom1/2/
[16:32:05] <MikeD_> it's closer though
[16:32:32] <SpecialTech> taplar: no - so I'm assuming it's "click" then? or
[16:33:01] <MikeD_> probably shouldn't be using == and relying on the typecasting to compare a numeric negative one with the string value of dash one
[16:33:22] <taplar> go with change, like MikeD_ showed
[16:33:28] <taplar> though i'd use on('change', ...)
[16:33:38] <MikeD_> arguably, "selectOptions" is a misleading variable name for a string value too
[16:33:47] <MikeD_> taplar: me too
[16:34:33] <MikeD_> also, don't stop on the options via the .text() assignment
[16:35:00] <SpecialTech> MikeD_ sorry didn't see your reply, checking now
[16:35:54] <MikeD_> they way this works right now, if you specify a value on ANY required field it'll show the button
[16:36:21] <MikeD_> and it doesn't hide the button if you reset the select to blank (but it does destroy all the options in the select if you rechoose blank)
[16:37:21] <SpecialTech> MikeD_ if I wanted to open it up to match all select, would I change $(this) to just find all options values instead?
[16:38:00] <taplar> personally i'd preselect the elements into a variable, and on each change, filter them to see if any do not have a value
[16:38:11] <taplar> if they all have a value, show the button, else hide it
[16:39:30] <MikeD_> are you looking to make a generic solution for "all .required fields have a value" ?
[16:41:34] <MikeD_> ex: you might have a "model year" field that's NOT a select... how do you accomodate that
[16:41:50] <MikeD_> much easier if you have specifically 2-3 fields and you know them by name
[16:42:39] <MikeD_> yeah, over-engineered general purpose scripts are awesome... but yagni is a good reason not to roll your own.
[16:43:24] <SpecialTech> its all selects currently, so I won't have issues with inputs
[16:43:55] <SpecialTech> and yea just general solution to check if all required have a selection
[16:44:31] <MikeD_> I'm out of here for today, so ask me again tomorrow to break whatever you come up with  :)
[17:37:10] <saul> Hello i'm having trouble using a library called datatables, i'm trying to initialize it with simple examples from the site .. has anyone used it befor ?
[17:52:54] <SpecialTech> saul ive worked with it before
[18:23:13] <saul> SpecialTech: i figured it out! i had an extra <script> loading jquery at the bottom of my HTML
[18:23:21] <saul> once i got rid of that it displayed my example
[18:23:32] <SpecialTech> ah ok :p cool
[18:23:51] <saul> now i'm having trouble w something else but im not sure if it's a jquery thing really :p
[18:23:59] <saul> actuall not jquery, more client-side javascript i think
[18:24:26] <saul> i know i have a piece of data in the request body coming back from my node server, but i cant access it from javascript
[18:25:54] <Juinn> guys how can i stop function from working again for like the next 1 minute?... https://jsfiddle.net/s79mj1jf/   ....and then allow to work again if click keydown on input
[18:43:48] <SpecialTech> Juinn, setInvertal on keydown mouseover so it only happens every 1min, then use off keydown event to mouseout.
[18:57:41] <Juinn> SpecialTech: thank you

[19:52:59] <JoeCreates> its been a while since I did any js, but I'm having some trouble illustrated here: https://jsfiddle.net/97x3sdg8/6/
[19:54:04] <SlimmyJimmy> I got a JSON file of data that represents JSON objects but it does not have 1)the start/end array brackets for all the objects or 2)any commas separating the objects themselves, so it's just the objects. How can I fix this fast?
[19:59:07] <SlimmyJimmy> HI

[20:12:59] <WhirledPress> by whom?
[20:58:56] * WhirledPress watches a tumbleweed roll by...
[21:10:21] <questionsarefood> hi guys. I have an interesting problem: I am trying to be one of the first people to know if a curtain globally important event happened. It is supposed to happen in the upcoming days. I decided I want to use js to help me go through the reuters feed and look for predetermined keywords and then have it alert me in some way. I am looking for 2 things. first is how to easily search the json object I receive, second is making a 
[21:10:50] <questionsarefood>  (maybe I will have it interface with other api's so a non specific search in the json response would be best)
[21:48:15] <Alturic> Hey guys, I'm following the "code organization" concepts at (https://learn.jquery.com/code-organization/concepts/) instead of putting everything inside document.ready and I've gotten what I'm looking for based off "The Module Pattern", what I'm curious of, instead of my old way where I just did if (variableName > 2) { //code }, how would I use feature.sayPrivateThing(); in that type of if
[21:48:16] <Alturic> statement?
[21:49:42] <Alturic> https://jsfiddle.net/xt0b2dqh/ - Is what I'm got, which I'm sure isn't exactly correct, but calling laborTierRate.selectedRate(); returns what I'm expecting to see based of the <select>'s value.
[21:52:30] <WhirledPress> add the html part to the fiddle so it makes more sense..
[21:55:46] <Alturic> Interesting, you can just do: if (laborTierRate.selectedRate() > 2) { //code }
[21:56:19] <WhirledPress> https://jsfiddle.net/xt0b2dqh/1/
[21:56:19] <Alturic> I guess I was so archaic I was used to just using variables in if statements, and not functions.
[21:56:43] <WhirledPress> it's not necessarily archaic if it's practical.
[21:56:47] <WhirledPress> and readable
[21:57:09] <Alturic> Well, I guess I meant "simple", as a derogatory meaning about myself learning jQuery. ha
[21:58:17] <Alturic> Wait, did your 3 lines replace my 18?
[21:58:20] <Alturic> o.O
[21:58:41] <WhirledPress> Not sure that they do the same thing, but it looks like it at least
[21:59:12] <Alturic> It's returning the correct values in the console.
[22:01:02] <Alturic> Could I bother you for ONE more thing? :-/
[22:01:12] <Alturic> Explaining what the heck that val line is doing? Ha.
[22:01:46] <Alturic> Ahh short-hand it looks like?
[22:02:03] <WhirledPress> I just took the .val of your field and parsefloated it
[22:02:13] <WhirledPress> like you did twice
[22:03:03] <Alturic> Right, I mean the return. So it's picking the inputs value, I got that. Then the return is doing the actual if, short-hand. If val is less than or equal to 0, it's 0, else take the val and divide by 100.
[22:03:09] <Alturic> Interesting.
[22:03:20] <WhirledPress> then the return says, if val<=0 return 0, otherwise return val/100
[22:03:43] <Alturic> Right, super skookum.
[22:03:48] <WhirledPress> return question?true:false;
[22:04:01] <Alturic> Well, wow. Just wow, thank you so much,.
[22:04:09] <WhirledPress> np
[22:35:04] <Alturic> WhirledPress Can you help with one last thing, that short-hand syntax, how would I check isNaN? So my existing if statements were all: if (isNaN(parseFloat($('#bidSectionOneInputManHoursWideDeckMowing').val()))) { var val = ... } else { var val = ... }. Me being the simpleton would wrap that var val=parseFloat line you made in those pesky if statements completely destroying the beauty of those
[22:35:04] <Alturic> 4 lines you gave me. https://jsfiddle.net/8kL0xe4u/
[22:36:37] <Alturic> Everything *should* be a number, but if they happen to type in a letter, I get NaN everywhere that used that variable/function, so I over-write the NaN with 0.
[22:55:48] <Alturic> I think I got it. return ( (isNaN(val)) || (val <= 0) ? 0 : val);
[23:38:55] <acidjazz> why does $('.listing').on('click', '.cancel', this.cancelHandler); give me "Uncaught TypeError: Cannot create property 'guid' on string '.cancel'"
