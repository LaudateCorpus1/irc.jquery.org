[01:52:15] <dimi1947> I have a div element with display:flex and I want to make that display:none...I tried that with the attr() method but it has no effect...what can I do?
[02:29:14] <Cork> dimi1947: .hide()
[02:34:01] <dimi1947> Cork:despite hide() does the job I cannot use it for other reasons...
[02:35:27] <dimi1947> Cork:I must target these hidden divs later...
[02:37:29] <dimi1947> a class was a good way to do that but a class applying display:none has no effect...the original style prevails
[02:38:22] <dimi1947> Cork:remember this:https://jsfiddle.net/fiddlehunt/dk08Lp69/
[04:50:34] <anli_> Is there some plugin that can tell me if there on a webpage is a lot of elements? I want those marked visually...
[04:52:21] <Cork> anli_: if there is a lot of elements?
[04:52:33] <Cork> $('*').length > 10000 or what?
[04:53:23] <anli_> Hard do say, but it would be nice with a slider where I can set the threshold, if a component has a larger amount of children than the threshold, I want it red
[04:53:52] <anli_> We have some performance issues and want to check out if the browser has problems
[04:55:09] <Cork> anli_: you don't want that in the production framework
[04:55:18] <Cork> you want it as a testsuite or something like that
[04:55:32] <anli_> That is true
[04:55:37] <anli_> Still, we want to do it
[04:55:56] <Cork> ya, but you won't find a plugin for it
[04:56:04] <Cork> definitely not one with a slider
[04:56:44] <anli_> I am fine with injecting a script on a webpage
[05:00:47] <anli_> heatmap.js was neat
[05:51:46] <Kartagis> how can I get div.class > span > strong > text > text?

[08:37:28] <DukeDrake> hi
[08:42:37] <DukeDrake> There was some update on the policy of how to handle .show() ... ? I used to clone an element, set it to show(), then add it to the DOM. Now it only works if I first add it to DOM, the show() it
[08:49:21] <Cork> DukeDrake: hmm, shouldn't matter
[08:51:07] <Cork> DukeDrake: works just fine https://jsfiddle.net/u0qzhzkj/
[08:53:33] <anli_> It seems that I can get a scripting error without the developer tools console not reporting it, I tried to console.log out an undefined variable and the execution silently stopped...
[08:58:13] <DukeDrake> Cork: thanx ... works in chrome, doens't work in Firefox?? o.O
[08:58:38] <DukeDrake> (hang on, might be noscript)
[08:58:55] <DukeDrake> yupp, was noscript
[08:59:36] <Cork> works fine here in both firefox and chrome
[09:01:05] <DukeDrake> hah, but I could reproduce my error \o/
[09:02:12] <DukeDrake> https://jsfiddle.net/u0qzhzkj/1/
[09:02:44] <DukeDrake> doesn't work. But if you put clone.find('.myspan').show(); as the last line, it works....
[09:03:10] <Cork> DukeDrake: ya, setting display: none and then "fixing" that with .show() was depricated in 3 if i remember correctly
[09:03:17] <Cork> use .hide()
[09:04:09] <DukeDrake> Cork: ah .... ok .... but that makes it harder to write non obtrusive code?
[09:04:34] <Cork> the oposite actaully
[09:04:38] <Cork> *actually
[09:05:05] <Cork> if it is meant to be shown by js, it should most of the time be visible by default and hidden by js
[09:05:06] <DukeDrake> the display:none element shouldn't show up, if the user doesn't have Javascript
[09:05:24] <Cork> just toggle the class then
[09:05:37] <DukeDrake> heh xD
[09:05:47] <Cork> removeClass('myclashttps://jsfiddle.net/u0qzhzkj/2/
[09:05:49] <Cork> opps
[09:05:49] <Cork> https://jsfiddle.net/u0qzhzkj/2/
[09:06:36] <Cork> Duikb00t_: the problem is in older version of jquery .show had to be smart to try to figure out what the old state was of the element
[09:06:45] <Cork> that has been depricated
[09:06:59] <Cork> and it is much cleaner to just use removeClass/toggleClass
[09:07:10] <Cork> cause then you can control what happens in the normal css rules
[09:23:42] <poboy> there are multiple cityzip classes.  I just want this to affect the closest.  thoughts?  https://kopy.io/Fs9XV
[09:29:56] <Cork> poboy: dom doesn't have closest
[09:30:26] <Cork> if you have a shared parent, or if it is a sibling or something like that you can base it on that info
[09:45:31] <poboy> I just don't understand. this code works perfectly on the file where that class only exists once.  but on the file where it exists 3 times it's changing the html to "" no matter what
[09:46:33] <Cork> poboy: ya, cause you're working with everything on the page, not with things related to the current element
[09:48:20] <poboy> I hate being ignorant.  :(
[09:50:01] <localh0st> poboy: fiddle complete code
[09:51:16] <localh0st> poboy: you are executing .change() on each $('.cityZip') element
[09:52:40] <Cork> that isn't the problem
[09:52:58] <Cork> he does $('.cityZip').val().length inside the change event
[09:53:10] <localh0st> ah
[09:53:23] <Cork> that the change event is bound on each element is sub optimal, but not a problem
[09:53:41] <poboy> and I can't do .closest.$('.' + zipgroup + 'zipcitylabel').html("");?
[09:53:56] <Cork> no, cause the elements aren't a parent
[09:54:07] <poboy> arggggg
[09:54:07] <Cork> like i said, dom don't have a concept of "closest"
[09:54:17] <Cork> it is either a parent, a child a sibling or a child of a sibling
[09:54:20] <Cork> nothing else
[13:44:24] <poboy> crossposted but here's my question -
[13:44:24] <poboy> https://jsfiddle.net/jpfzzbm6/ I'm trying to follow this tutorial https://cmatskas.com/importing-csv-files-using-jquery-and-html5/  but I'm unable to open csv files.  Any thoughts?
[13:49:08] <robertmaxrees> your fiddle has a syntax error poboy
[13:50:02] <robertmaxrees> should work otherwise.
[13:54:20] <poboy> robertmaxrees I don't see it.  Will you tell me what it is?
[13:57:16] <poboy> I need to pull in that jquery csv library it seems
[13:57:41] <robertmaxrees> and fix your syntax error.
[13:58:44] <poboy> where??
[13:59:05] <robertmaxrees> open your console duder.

[14:05:38] <jak2000> hi firends:  with help of all ppl , specially taplar, robertmaxrees cork and others i do the cloned div with all controls.... now i want if i clone a Div.... and want delete how to do? here my fiddle: https://jsfiddle.net/jamiguel77/h8eya88m/
[14:06:06] <robertmaxrees> "and want delete" as in...?
[14:06:11] <jak2000> a row....
[14:06:13] <robertmaxrees> ah
[14:06:14] <jak2000> wait
[14:06:17] <robertmaxrees> what have you tried?
[14:06:31] <robertmaxrees> ah, so first things first.
[14:06:56] <robertmaxrees> $('.clbtnDeleteMe').click(function() { will only bind to the ones that exist on pageload.
[14:06:59] <robertmaxrees> you want a delegated event handler.

[14:07:18] <robertmaxrees> http://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/
[14:07:25] <robertmaxrees> ^ these two links cover it.
[14:07:44] <poboy> doh!  thanks robertmaxrees
[14:08:19] <robertmaxrees> yep :)

[16:04:50] <dlam> is there a way to do the opposite of event.stopImmediatePropagation()?   im trying to do some stuff first before  it bubbles up etc.
[16:05:09] <dlam> (maybe it's with .trigger()  ?)
[16:05:22] <robertmaxrees> why not just abstract the function you want to later call and call it directly?
[16:10:40] <dlam> oh oh i get what you mean,  i think i cant do that because im doing some convulted  angularjs thing :D
[16:11:07] <dlam> it like uses some "jquery lite" thing
[16:18:55] <robertmaxrees> so then my next question: why does the order of the handlers firing matter?
[16:37:21] <renic> exit
[17:51:33] <guideX> I have this weird error happening in jquery.js:9705 GET http://site.com/undefined 404 (Not Found)

[17:52:35] <taplar> look in your network tab for that url
[17:52:49] <taplar> if it is an xhr request, then that's an ajax request not finding something
[17:53:08] <taplar> otherwise, it'd be something like jquery loading some script that is then trying to pull that file

[18:14:08] <taplar> and gals
[18:14:23] <taplar> nerds can dream
[18:14:25] <randymarsh9> any idea how i would overwrite a table's HTML with HTML i have stored somewhere?
[18:14:27] <randymarsh9> lol
[18:14:43] <randymarsh9> lets not get our hopes up
[18:15:00] <taplar> the table contents, or the table itself?
[18:15:10] <randymarsh9> table itself
[18:15:20] <taplar> you can do a replaceWith() on the table, iirc
[18:15:36] <randymarsh9> ok let me try
[18:15:47] <taplar> http://api.jquery.com/replaceWith/
[18:19:07] <randymarsh9> cool i think that works exactly how i needed it to
[18:19:11] <randymarsh9> ty!
[18:23:59] <randymarsh9> i wish i learned about jquery years ago
[18:24:01] <randymarsh9> so cool
[18:28:16] <V7> Hey all ;)
[18:28:23] <V7> Could you help me with this
[18:28:37] <V7> I.e. we have "var tables = $('.dataTable').DataTable( );"
[18:28:56] <V7> So how to do sometihng like tables.each( ); ?
[18:29:13] <V7> Btw .DataTable( ) returns Api
[18:29:24] <taplar> and you want to each over the table elements?
[18:30:30] * taplar pokes V
[18:32:16] <V7> Yeah
[18:32:24] <V7> Btw it returns https://i.imgur.com/Gr4yW3u.png
[18:32:32] <taplar> i'd probably just stick it in a variable before that, and then use that variable for the each
[18:33:00] <V7> I wan't this because of this: var table = tables.table('#result_table_0');
[18:33:25] <V7> So ( "#result_table_0" ) should be a table from each cycle
[18:33:35] <taplar> so you don't want to loop over the tables.  you want to loop over the elements that datatables made?
[18:33:44] <V7> Yes
[18:33:50] <taplar> ah.  no clue
[18:34:03] <V7> The main reson is to get id of them
[18:34:18] <V7> To do var table = tables.table('#result_table_0'); for each table
[18:35:24] <taplar> https://www.datatables.net/reference/api/
[18:37:43] <V7> oh dataTable
[18:37:53] <V7> Thank you taplar
[18:44:40] <V7> What's better or what's the main difference of $.each (jQuery.each) and other cycle like *.forEach ?
[18:45:10] <taplar> forEach is the native method for Arrays
[18:45:15] <V7> native ?
[18:45:21] <taplar> javascript implementation
[18:45:27] <V7> Oh
[18:45:36] <V7> So each is pure jquery ?
[18:45:44] <V7> foreach is from js ?
[18:45:52] <taplar> i don't want to say pure
[18:45:58] <taplar> jQuery is a javascript library
[18:46:04] <V7> Ok then "pure"
[18:46:13] <taplar> each() is just a method written to do what forEach does, provided forEach does not exist
[18:46:24] <V7> But why then ?
[18:46:32] <taplar> because not all browser implement forEach
[18:46:42] <taplar> or they all didn't
[18:46:52] <taplar> jQuery fills in gaps for consistency
[18:46:53] <V7> You mean not all implement js ?
[18:46:59] <taplar> no
[18:47:07] <taplar> there are different versions of javascript
[18:47:08] <V7> So forEach is not js ?
[18:47:22] <taplar> and not all browsers implement all the methods of javascript in each version
[18:47:34] <taplar> forEach -is- javascript
[18:48:00] <V7> https://codepen.io/calvinanderson/pen/JWOExG
[18:48:06] <V7> Like this  ?
[18:48:07] <taplar> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/forEach
[18:48:24] <taplar> if you look towards the bottom there is a table showing what browser and their version started supporting forEach
[18:48:31] <taplar> before that version, the browser did not now what forEach was
[18:48:37] <taplar> *know
[18:48:57] <taplar> so for instance, IE 8 doesn't know what forEach is
[18:49:03] <V7> Wow IE8 didn't
[18:49:14] <V7> Oh you first wrote this ))
[18:49:38] <V7> So which one would you use for array cycle ( array goes from selector )
[18:49:43] <V7> ?
[18:49:55] <taplar> if you have a jquery object, just use each() off of it
[18:50:18] <V7> So like $.each( array, ... ?
[18:50:47] <V7> Is it clear to write $. at the beginning ?
[18:50:58] <taplar> $.each( array, ... )  or jqueryObject.each(...)
[18:50:59] <V7> It look like somehing cutted
[18:51:02] <taplar> they are different methods
[18:51:17] <taplar> $.each() and $().each() are different methods
[18:51:36] <V7> Hmm
[18:51:38] <V7> Roger
[18:51:42] <V7> Thank you very much taplar
[18:51:46] <taplar> sure
[18:52:29] <V7> You're very great you did you know that ?
[18:52:43] <taplar> nah
[18:52:47] <V7> yup
[18:52:54] <taplar> i just repeat the same stuff over and over, :P
[18:53:18] <V7> Sometimes this's very great method to do something ood really
[18:53:22] <V7> good *

[20:29:51] <jak2000> or drinking?
[20:29:59] <robertmaxrees> lol
[20:30:03] <robertmaxrees> over 400 people here dude.

[20:30:15] <jak2000> want a beer? :)
[20:30:24] <robertmaxrees> what's up?
[20:30:52] <jak2000> solved my problem: https://jsfiddle.net/b7q5tdsw/5/
[20:31:01] <jak2000> for  delte a row (with event delegation)...
[20:31:23] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[20:31:36] <robertmaxrees> so for $(document).on("change", ".clselect1", function() {
[20:31:44] <robertmaxrees> you wanna bind lower than document if at all possible.
[20:32:36] <jak2000> https://jsfiddle.net/jamiguel77/wdoqaeyw/  my more actual fiddle
[20:32:57] <robertmaxrees> same thing.
[20:32:59] <jak2000> but in production code not work..... because i use bootstrap and use div and div...
[20:33:13] <jak2000> understand your advice..
[20:33:20] <jak2000> robertmaxrees what is: $(this).closest('div[id^="Meal"]').remove();   ?
[20:33:32] <robertmaxrees> >.>
[20:33:36] <robertmaxrees> what do you think it is?
[20:33:55] <jak2000> the id of div is: <div id="Meal_00">      i think div[id^="Meal"]   is like....
[20:34:30] <robertmaxrees> it's "id starts with"
[20:34:33] <robertmaxrees> but I got a question for you.
[20:34:42] <robertmaxrees> what's with the ID naming convention? xid_00 xid_01 select_00 button_00
[20:34:44] <jak2000> shoot
[20:35:02] <jak2000> because cloning the input controls
[20:35:17] <robertmaxrees> but why use IDs at all?
[20:35:43] <jak2000> :) i take an example and start from it...
[20:35:43] <robertmaxrees> the parent div already has a unique ID. does every form control also need a unique ID?
[20:35:44] <jak2000> :(
[20:35:54] <jak2000> no...
[20:36:00] <robertmaxrees> heh
[20:36:02] <jak2000> ok i understand and fix..
[20:36:05] <jak2000> but
[20:36:07] <robertmaxrees> :)
[20:36:18] <jak2000> but in production code not work..... because i use bootstrap and use div and div...
[20:36:33] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[20:36:37] <jak2000> see my code:
[20:36:42] <robertmaxrees> "and use div and div"?
[20:37:14] <jak2000> https://jsfiddle.net/jamiguel77/qx2g4q5x/
[20:37:33] <jak2000> see the first line with class: 'clclonedInput'
[20:37:44] <robertmaxrees> that's not actual HTML fwiw.
[20:37:49] <robertmaxrees> but what's the confusion?>
[20:37:56] <robertmaxrees> you'll have toi change your selectors to work with that.
[20:37:59] <jak2000>  $(document).on('click', '.clbtnEliminaRenglon', function () {  $(this).closest('div[id^="clclonedInput"]').remove();   });
[20:38:28] <jak2000> whis not wor on the fiddle i think because exist more and more div.
[20:38:30] <robertmaxrees> with what you know now, you should be able to =figure that part out.
[20:39:06] <jak2000> i think:
[20:39:08] <robertmaxrees> again
[20:39:21] <robertmaxrees> that id^= is "id starts with.
[20:39:33] <robertmaxrees> you're trying to get the div whose ID starts with clclonedInput
[20:39:46] <robertmaxrees> do you see anything what an ID that starts with that?
[20:40:05] <jak2000> i see
[20:40:17] <jak2000> testing
[20:40:25] <robertmaxrees> this is why IDs are bad for this kind of thing.
[20:40:26] <robertmaxrees> use classes instead.
[20:40:43] <jak2000> :)
[20:40:58] <jak2000> ok, what is the best way?
[20:41:02] <robertmaxrees> ...
[20:41:08] <robertmaxrees> literally just said heh
[20:41:15] <jak2000> $(this).closest('dic.clonedInput').remove();
[20:41:15] <jak2000> ?
[20:41:18] <jak2000> sorry
[20:41:24] <jak2000> $(this).closest('div.clonedInput').remove();
[20:41:27] <jak2000> ?
[20:41:34] <robertmaxrees> don't prepend tagnames onto selectors.
[20:41:35] <robertmaxrees> but yeah
[20:42:22] <jak2000> ok
[20:42:53] <robertmaxrees> gotta dash.  if you've got more questions, just ask the channel.  no need to ping me ;)
[22:21:12] <Kasalop> Hi there
[22:25:30] <Kasalop> I'm trying to include jquery later to a side which already uses an old version of jquery. The scenario is like this: page opens, loads and uses an old version of jquery. Now my script executes and I want to use a newer version of jquery. I cannot replace the jquery of the page because the page wont work anymore. In reason of a continuating usage of jquery of the page it is not possible to load the new version and use noConflict to re
[22:27:50] <Kasalop> I tried the following: Create a blob with a min html document which loads jquery and jquery ui, insert this document as an iframe into the side. when it's loaded pick the reference out of the iframe with noConflict (doesn't matter. Could also be a normal copy) and assign it to a varible in the context of the parent window.
[22:28:03] <snover> Kasalop: this is why module loaders are a thing. use a module loader.
[22:29:27] <Kasalop> Works fine! Page's not stopping and I can use both jquery versions at the same time. But the window / document reference inside the new jquery instance is wrong and so I got some issues with drag and drop and such things.
[22:30:51] <Kasalop> Hi snover. Which one do you prefer? while reading the jquery code I couldn't figure out how this could help me. But perhaps I oversaw the point.
[22:35:23] <snover> the point is that they don’t pollute the global scope so you can’t have conflicting jQuery objects.
[22:38:44] <Kasalop> I thought so. But I wasn't aware that will work with jquery because it needs "a" window / document. So if I use a module loader, lets say requirejs, the new version I will load will never loaded inside the gobal space (not for a milisecond) but has access to the window and document of the page so I can use it like always?
[22:49:31] <Kasalop> @snover I took a look at requirejs and the code says: if it's inside a browser: load the script by create a script tag and insert it inside the head element. So it's not a solution for my problem or am I missing something?
[22:50:00] <snover> you’re missing something.
[23:01:40] <Kasalop> @snover so please feel free to point me to right direction. I cite from the official requirejs website: "jQuery registers itself as the global variables "$" and "jQuery", even when it detects AMD/RequireJS". So how can I achieve my described target without loading the new version inside the global context? If I trust the requirejs website... there is no way.
[23:14:04] <Kasalop> Too late for now. Thanks anyway snover. I will read a little bit and come back tomorrow or the day after. bye bye and thanks
