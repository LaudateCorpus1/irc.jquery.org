[00:00:28] <robertparkerx> I don't understand
[00:00:48] <robertparkerx> ah
[00:00:52] <robertparkerx> I think I might
[00:01:12] <robertparkerx> how could I target each?
[00:01:12] <robertmaxrees> the event can be a string of space separated event names.
[00:01:21] <robertmaxrees> what do you mean?
[00:01:29] <robertparkerx> say just for mouseenter
[00:01:38] <robertparkerx> inside of the func
[00:01:55] <robertmaxrees> they're all doing the exact same thing, though your click is one px off.
[00:02:32] <robertparkerx> you're right
[00:03:16] <robertmaxrees> either way - are you sure this isn't a css problem or some other issue?  if the handlers are firing, are you seeing things happen in the element inspector?  if so, maybe your css isn't building properly.
[00:03:55] <robertparkerx> robertmaxrees https://url.hashdev.org/4v
[00:04:44] <robertparkerx> or maybe else if
[00:04:53] <robertmaxrees> i would go else if, but sure
[00:18:34] <robertparkerx> I don't know why but that fixed everything
[00:25:49] <robertmaxrees> interesting.
[00:51:27] <robertparkerx> I think it's my new plugin, unused css
[00:51:38] <robertparkerx> it doesn't create the rule for .flip class
[00:51:52] <robertmaxrees> :) so a build issue
[00:55:11] <robertparkerx> yea I have to exclude this page
[00:55:31] <robertparkerx> I guess I could have inline css just for this page
[01:01:01] <robertparkerx> excluding worked
[01:03:20] <robertmaxrees> bam
[09:35:17] <irthewinner> guys, what could be the reason why Magnific Popup (jquery related plugin) is not working? it's not displaying any error, here's my code:
[09:35:19] <irthewinner> https://jsfiddle.net/5uLz4qon/
[09:36:10] <irthewinner> when i click on image it just shows me the image on new screen, the plugin is not working , but no errors
[09:37:12] <robertparkerx> are you sure it's loaded? Are you sure you're initializing it?
[09:39:54] <irthewinner> hmm
[09:40:12] <irthewinner> i put these in the header: (my main.js is on the footer of body)
[09:40:27] <irthewinner> <link rel="stylesheet" href="/magnific-popup/dist/magnific-popup.css">
[09:40:34] <irthewinner> <script src="/magnific-popup/dist/jquery.magnific-popup.min.js"></script>
[09:40:58] <irthewinner> the path is from node_modules
[09:41:02] <irthewinner> but no errors
[09:45:11] <irthewinner> plugin from this https://dimsemenov.com/plugins/magnific-popup
