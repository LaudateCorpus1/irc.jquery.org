[01:12:59] <errorous> how can I remove dynamically added element?
[01:13:12] <robertmaxrees> select it and use .remove()
[01:13:28] <errorous> robertmaxrees nope, not working for dynamically added elements
[01:13:39] <Cork> O_o
[01:13:47] <robertmaxrees> gonna be a real bummer when i prove you wrong on that.
[01:14:08] <Cork> errorous: are they added by a mutationobserver?
[01:14:12] <robertmaxrees> lemme guess - you do something live var $foo = $('.foo');
[01:14:12] <Cork> else no you can remove them...
[01:14:19] <robertmaxrees> then later $foo.remove();
[01:14:53] <errorous> robertmaxrees not sure how it's added, nvd3 charts adds svg to my div
[01:14:56] <errorous> I want to remove it
[01:16:39] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/cvnku67e/
[01:16:47] <robertmaxrees> so
[01:17:15] <robertmaxrees> your issue is jquery + svg is a funky one.
[01:17:41] <robertmaxrees> https://stackoverflow.com/a/6794343/923919 this is a good overview
[01:17:54] <Cork> more like svg 1.1 is a funky one :)
[01:18:00] <robertmaxrees> hahahaha
[01:18:04] <Cork> hopefully 2.0 will make things better
[01:18:51] <robertmaxrees> yeah, def.  still tho - jquery is a DOM abstraction lib.  getting out of its wheelhouse just gives you headaches.
[01:18:55] <robertmaxrees> errorous make sense?
[01:19:29] <errorous> robertmaxrees does this stand only for jquery? can I do it in vanilla js?
[01:19:47] <robertmaxrees> did you look at what i linked?
[01:19:49] <robertmaxrees> :)
[01:20:09] <errorous> yes, but didn't quite understand
[01:20:24] <Cork> errorous: btw do you want to remove something like a path or the full svg element?
[01:20:39] <Cork> cause removing the svg element shoudn't have the svg sub document problems
[01:20:45] <robertmaxrees> ^
[01:20:54] <errorous> cork, I want to clear everything within certain div
[01:21:05] <robertmaxrees> errorous so you want to remove the entirety of the SVG element?
[01:21:15] <errorous> robertmaxrees yes
[01:21:31] <errorous> I want that <svg> gone
[01:21:34] <robertmaxrees> you could just select the parent div and do .html('');
[01:21:45] <Cork> * .empty()
[01:21:51] <errorous> empty doesn't work
[01:21:55] <robertmaxrees> ^ this would be even better.
[01:21:55] <errorous> let me try html
[01:21:56] <robertmaxrees> show us.
[01:21:58] <robertmaxrees> no stop
[01:22:07] <robertmaxrees> show us what you're doing, because empty() should work fine.
[01:22:08] <Cork> are you sure your selecting the correct element?
[01:22:11] <robertmaxrees> ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
[01:22:16] <errorous> Cork tes
[01:22:23] <errorous> yes
[01:22:26] <robertmaxrees> how do you know?
[01:22:44] <errorous> ...
[01:22:56] <robertmaxrees> it's a legit question :)
[01:23:32] <robertmaxrees> like, maybe you're selecting on an ID but aren't aware that ID is repeated on the page, which is causing your issue.
[01:24:33] <Cork> ^ that is a lot more common then you might think btw >_>
[01:24:42] <robertmaxrees> :)
[01:25:14] <errorous> Yeah, it's not that. It looks like it's something about this charts library
[01:25:30] <robertmaxrees> how are you selecting the element?
[01:25:43] <Cork> errorous: only other thing that might cause it would be mutationobserver recreating the element when you remove it
[01:25:43] <errorous> robertmaxrees $('#myChart')
[01:26:08] <errorous> Cork actually it looks like this charts lib is adding 3 svgs :)
[01:26:14] <Cork> console.log($('[id="myChart"]').length)
[01:26:16] <robertmaxrees> console.log($('[id="myChart"]').length)
[01:26:19] <robertmaxrees> hahahahahaha
[01:26:21] <Cork> :)
[01:26:26] <errorous> and I thought it's not removing the old ones
[01:26:27] <errorous> :)
[01:26:46] <robertmaxrees> ^ give that line a shot.
[01:26:48] <errorous> not always three, but when I change something 3 times
[01:26:58] <errorous> robertmaxrees, yeah, it's three
[01:27:02] <robertmaxrees> that's your issue.
[01:27:13] <Cork> ya, your removing another element then your looking at
[01:27:15] <robertmaxrees> id selectors only ever return the first instance.
[01:27:34] <Cork> you should prob replace the id with a class
[01:27:47] <Cork> and make sure your selecting the instance you care about
[01:27:52] <errorous> but I like my IDs :)
[01:27:58] <Cork> then make then unique
[01:28:07] <robertmaxrees> ^ IDs can only exist once per page.
[01:28:18] <robertmaxrees> using an ID more than once is invalid per the HTML spec.
[01:28:19] <errorous> <div class="id-foobar">
[01:28:19] <Cork> in javascript, css don't care
[01:28:37] <errorous> I don't have multiple same IDs
[01:28:41] <robertmaxrees> ...
[01:28:44] <robertmaxrees> you do.
[01:28:45] <errorous> not that much of an idiot
[01:28:54] <errorous> no I FUCKING don't
[01:29:02] <Cork> errorous: if console.log($('[id="myChart"]').length) gives you 3 you do...
[01:29:02] <robertmaxrees> you just said console.log($('[id="myChart"]').length) gives you three.
[01:29:08] <errorous> I hate when people know when they don't know
[01:29:15] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[01:29:28] <robertmaxrees> no need to be defensive.  stuff like this happens all the time.
[01:29:42] <errorous> man, don't even wanna asnwer
[01:29:49] <Cork> <_<'
[01:29:55] <robertmaxrees> k
[01:30:38] <errorous> btw, when you said $('#myChart').length, I actually meant $('#myChart svg').length
[01:30:46] <errorous> and I did try that, and it was three
[01:30:52] <robertmaxrees> except neither of us suggested that.
[01:30:59] <errorous> yeah, that was my bad
[01:31:17] <robertmaxrees> $('[id="myChart"]').length != $('#myChart').length
[01:31:21] <robertmaxrees> two very different things.
[01:31:49] <robertmaxrees> $('#myChart').empty(); would work find if you didn't have multiple elements with that ID.
[01:31:57] <robertmaxrees> or if jquery was properly loaded, etc.
[01:36:02] <pavonia> robertmaxrees: How are they different?
[01:36:25] <Cork> pavonia: one selects by id (only one) the other selects by attributes (no limit)
[01:36:30] <robertmaxrees> ^
[01:36:41] <Cork> also one is as fast as it can be, and the other is the second slowest selector you can make
[01:37:23] <pavonia> Which one is the slowest?
[01:37:31] <robertmaxrees> [id="foo"]
[01:37:55] <pavonia> That's the same as above
[01:38:01] <robertmaxrees> ?
[01:38:06] <robertmaxrees> that's the attribute selector.
[01:38:24] <pavonia> Yeah, Cork said it's the second slowest of all
[01:38:44] <robertmaxrees> oh, misread your question.
[01:39:13] <robertmaxrees> either way, for demonstration re: .length: https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/cjoe09k3/
[01:41:47] <Cork> pavonia: :contains()
[01:42:21] <pavonia> Ah
[01:42:36] <Cork> as it serializes the entire sub dom and then searches through the text
[01:43:07] <robertmaxrees> hah
[01:43:08] <Cork> i cry a little every time i see some fairly new ppl use it here
[01:43:33] <robertmaxrees> lots of better ways to do something similar.
[01:43:38] <Cork> ya
[01:43:41] <Cork> a class for example
[01:43:59] <Cork> ppl should use WAY more classes!
[01:44:07] <robertmaxrees> agreed
[01:44:24] <Uhkis> oh the class struggle
[01:45:23] <Cork> the worst of them all is <button>Order</button> $('button:contains(Order)')
[01:45:38] <Cork> congrats you've just made your page untranslatable
[09:34:17] <mikunos> hi guys is there a way to select a select object with a partial name? https://jsfiddle.net/f3opyntg/
[09:34:51] <mikunos> I'd like to select the textarea closest to the select with the name "quicktext"
[09:37:19] <mikunos> $('select[name="quicktext"]').find("textarea:first");
[09:37:27] <mikunos> this is the idea
[09:38:33] <mikunos> have you a clue?!
[09:40:54] <Cork> you can try *=
[09:41:11] <Cork> thought it will also match reply[quicktexting]
[09:42:03] <Cork> mikunos: but what about $('select + textarea')
[09:42:04] <mikunos> ok
[09:42:20] <mikunos> let me test
[09:42:22] <Cork> that will give you the textarea elements that are directly after a select element
[09:43:11] <Cork> mikunos: though that said, might be worth giving that textarea an id or class
[09:43:26] <Cork> would make the code more stable
[09:43:34] <mikunos> unfortunatelly I cannot do it
[09:44:26] <Cork> mikunos: and why can't you select on the full field name?
[09:44:46] <mikunos> because I have to use the same js for two forms
[09:45:01] <Cork> ...
[09:45:13] <mikunos> ant the object is located in two different side of the form
[09:45:16] <Cork> then have the group name set as a value on the form or something
[09:45:49] <Cork> as in <form data-group-name="reply">
[09:46:02] <Cork> and just grab it out for the selection
[09:46:36] <Cork> you really should make the html work for you instead of wrangling the js around the dom structure
[09:46:41] <Cork> it never becomes stable if you do
[09:49:36] <taplar> mikunos you should be able to use the `*=` attribute selector
[09:50:36] <mikunos> taplar how?
[09:50:40] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/y5gkxhe0/
[09:51:11] <taplar> https://api.jquery.com/attribute-contains-selector/
[09:51:30] <mikunos> thanks but I have to select the textarea and not the select
[09:52:22] <taplar> the same logic can be applied to the textarea
[09:53:45] <mikunos> https://jsfiddle.net/ygntc69L/
[09:53:56] <mikunos> it gets both textarea
[09:54:02] <mikunos> .first() ?
[09:54:17] <taplar> why not change the substring you're looking for?
[09:54:54] <mikunos> I cannot change it
[09:55:29] <undefined_bob> maybe you just need to try harder changing it?
[09:55:34] <taplar> i think you're misunderstanding me.  One has the name "reply[message]" and the other has the name "general[message]"
[09:55:49] <taplar> and you are looking for the substring of message, which is shared
[09:55:49] <mikunos> right
[09:55:58] <taplar> so, change it to look for a non-shared substring
[09:56:19] <mikunos> I cannot do it
[09:56:36] <taplar> why not?  you just changed your selector from the non-working version to the version you currently have
[10:00:51] <mikunos> https://jsfiddle.net/ygntc69L/4/
[10:00:54] <mikunos> solved
[10:00:55] <mikunos> thanks
[10:06:24] <taplar> (y)  whatever works for you
