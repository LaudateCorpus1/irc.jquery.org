[02:59:25] <mad_moses> Cork: Hi, on which event should I ask this? $(windows).on('scroll', function) {?
[03:00:01] <Cork> uh, what?
[03:00:18] <Cork> are you asking if that is the event you should use?
[03:00:49] <mad_moses> Cork: excuse my bad English. Yes
[03:01:14] <Cork> yes you want to catch scroll on the window object if you want to test the scroll position
[03:01:34] <Cork> note though that the scroll event is async so it has a bit of a lag to the actual scrolling
[03:01:50] <Cork> so don't expect perfect match for the numbers
[03:04:18] <mad_moses> Cork: Okay thank you
[06:33:56] <dwordo> hello
[07:16:29] <mad_moses> Cork: how do you load your css files? => $(document.head).append($('<script>', { src: url })); Do you just replace <script> with <style> ?
[07:35:15] <Cork> mad_moses: you REALLY shouldn't dynamically load css files
[07:35:33] <Cork> when you inject a css file you force the browser to rerender every element in the page
[07:35:40] <Cork> better is to include it statically
[07:36:38] <mad_moses> Cork: okay, so there is no "good" way to load css files lazy?
[07:37:03] <Cork> no, cause it means everything in the page will have to be rerendered for every load
[07:37:23] <Cork> as there is no way for the browser to know what elements are affected by a new stylesheet
[07:37:41] <Uhkis> the performance gain from lazyloading css is non-existant too
[07:37:53] <Cork> well its the oposite
[07:38:06] <Cork> you will lose performance
[07:38:54] <mad_moses> Okay thank you!
[07:39:08] <Uhkis> on the render part yes, but even in network?
[07:39:51] <Cork> depends on if you only care about initial traffic or not
[15:07:59] <Flyste> This is kind of a shot in the dark, but maybe someone has some idea.
[15:09:28] <Flyste> I am going a html validator and there is a <!-- inside of another <!--, but when I remove the extra <!-- a script that adds a css class in the html stops working
[15:12:32] <Hoppelhase> You cannot nest comments in HTML, as far as I know. So the first --> will end both comments
[15:13:29] <Flyste> It wont orphan the first the first?
[15:13:40] <Flyste> Like <!-- <!-- something -->
[15:13:57] <Flyste> Wouldn't it just end the second <!-- and the first would jsut be invalid?
[15:14:06] <Flyste> Or the second <!-- becomes invalid
[15:15:08] <Flyste> I wonder if jquery could handle it differently than the html processor
[15:16:29] <Hoppelhase> Not sure, what you are asking, but anything after then first --> will be normal HTML text
[15:16:43] <Hoppelhase> I don't think jQuery is related here in any way
[15:17:11] <Hoppelhase> or at least I see no relation
[15:17:37] <Flyste> Let me try a few tests with it.
[15:49:24] <noob_noob> is there a way to use jquery to preserve the url from an anchor tag into a modal
[16:12:45] <nothinghere> How would I get a button to post json to server on click?
[22:34:56] <jeremyxwing> Hey all! I wanna build a simple typing test (personal use). Something that expects me to type "quick brown fox" and then throws up an alert or something if I mess up. I've gotten as far as textarea  with an on change function, but I'm not sure how to trigger something when it strays from a specific phase. I want it to be to the letter.
[22:35:13] <jeremyxwing> I'm not looking for an exact example, just to be pointed in the right direction. Thanks!
