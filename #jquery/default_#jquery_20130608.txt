[00:25:20] <lenswipee> why does second alert not work?
[00:25:50] <lenswipee> trying to reset data value to empty
[00:26:00] <GoSox> i think you set it wrong
[00:26:05] <GoSox> .val('value');
[00:26:08] <GoSox> instead of .val()
[00:26:16] <GoSox> i think .val() is only for getting, not setting
[00:26:21] <GoSox> but double check because i'm not 100% on this
[00:26:39] <lenswipee> so i suppose theres a syntax error and so the second alert doesnt fire
[00:26:40] <lenswipee> ok
[00:26:52] <GoSox> wait no, you set the value in the attr() call actually
[00:27:20] <GoSox> .attr('data','');
[00:27:27] <lenswipee> ok try again
[00:27:39] <GoSox> send new link
[00:27:51] <lenswipee> bingo
[00:27:54] <lenswipee> it works

[00:29:22] <TelFiRE> Is it terrible practice to use jQuery to change classes (such as 'league-d' and 'division-a') to HTML5 custom data attributes (data-league="d" data-division="a")? I know it would be better to be in source but how much worse is this
[00:29:23] <tw2113> that's close enough to bitcoin
[00:29:50] <tw2113> so you're changing the attributes and not the attribute values TelFiRE ?
[00:30:23] <GoSox> TelFiRE: worse in what context? i mean classes are for styling generally, and data attributes are not, so it should be pretty clear which is better to use in a given situation?
[00:30:47] <TelFiRE> As in I start with just <li class="league-d division-a">blah</li> and I want to use jQuery to make it <li data-league="d" data-division="a">blah</li>
[00:30:58] <tw2113> why not just add both
[00:31:02] <tw2113> at the same time
[00:31:06] <tw2113> why do you need to change them?
[00:31:14] <GoSox> yeah this doesn't make sense, need more info
[00:31:36] <TelFiRE> Because as far as I can find, Drupal's Views doesn't let you do custom data attributes without implementing a custom module
[00:31:53] <TelFiRE> so basically I don't control the markup but I can add any classes I need
[00:32:00] <GoSox> i don't know what any of that means, i write my own code from scratch, like a man.
[00:32:39] <TelFiRE> Cool story bro
[00:32:46] <tw2113> i'm still confused why you're trying to change the class attribute to data-* attributes
[00:33:35] <TelFiRE> I'm using views to expose the data and a jquery plugin called mixitup which uses data attributes to create animated filters
[00:33:40] <GoSox> your question is about best practices. You can easily take values of a class, and add them as data values. As far as best practices, you're making a hack work around someone else's system, so you're already not in a "best" situation
[00:34:12] <TelFiRE> It's obviously better to start with the right markup
[00:34:35] <TelFiRE> my question is more along the lines of, what are the detriments of doing it this way as oppose to spending several hours extra
[00:34:54] <GoSox> i can't help you with that, for the previously mentioned reason.
[00:50:47] <lenswipee> trying to use a data structure where i can store an id and a value
[00:51:33] <lenswipee> i know javascript arrays won't allow me to do that as it is number index
[00:53:21] <tw2113> nested array
[00:53:46] <lenswipee> ?
[00:53:59] <tw2113> http://freewebdesigntutorials.com/javaScriptTutorials/jsArrayObject/multiDimensionalArrays.htm
[00:55:01] <lenswipee> yeah not a good idea
[00:56:20] <lenswipee> can't reference value without using numbers
[00:56:34] <lenswipee> that's not good for me

[00:58:31] <fikst> lenswipee, why don't you use an object
[00:58:38] <lenswipee> yeh, now i'm thinking how to write json enoded strings
[00:58:50] <lenswipee> so i can pass them to php server and json decode them
[01:00:07] <lenswipee> fikst: can i json_encode this array object?
[01:00:24] <tw2113> try it and see
[01:01:00] <AlmtyBob> that stackoverflow link has a basic dictionary object for you
[01:01:04] <lenswipee> don't even know what this object is and if there is a json encode function for it
[01:01:49] <tw2113> http://www.elated.com/articles/json-basics/
[01:02:10] <fikst> JSON.stringify() ?
[01:02:26] <lenswipee> is that a json string -> var a = {"a":"wohoo", 2:"hello2", "d":"hello"};
[01:03:55] <tw2113> i think the 2 would need quotes
[01:04:44] <tw2113> http://jsonlint.com/
[01:05:26] <lenswipee> i think numbers dont need quotes...
[01:06:10] <tw2113> that link cried invalid without the quotes
[01:06:35] <lenswipee> yeh i just got a cry
[01:06:55] <tw2113> you can convert back to int on the server
[01:07:26] <lenswipee> does jQuery have an array object>?
[01:12:44] <motaka2> hello in this url I want when someone clicks on an <a> element, the collapsing nested menu on right opens and then load the content of the target <a> in ajax on #main, but it seems somthing stops it to load it in ajax, something like stop propegate or so ... What should I do ?

[01:13:31] <funhouse> Can anyone recommend a good scrollbar plugin, I just want to be able to make it thinner.
[01:21:36] <GoSox> So I'm making a system where my users can write a review. I'm preprocessing the text they enter. I'm checking each of these:
[01:22:19] <GoSox> Review length (not too short or too long), case (not all uppercase or lowercase), check for long words, check for special/funny characters, check for swears.
[01:22:40] <GoSox> Anything else I can do to clean up the input?
[01:26:19] <lenswipee> hi, does on.('submit', function(){}); work for button with type submit?
[01:26:40] <GoSox> its not for buttons at all, it's for forms
[01:26:48] <GoSox> use a click or mouse down for a button

[01:32:05] <gry> I try $('#mytable tr:last').after('<tr>'+line+'</tr><tr>...</tr>'); but the newly added row appears to be empty, or it doesn't get created...
[01:32:48] <GoSox> line has to be in a <td> inside a <tr>

[01:40:03] <funhouse> http://manos.malihu.gr/jquery-custom-content-scroller/
[01:41:09] <GoSox> is there a javascript function for getting a sum of all values of an array? on an array that i specifically stored only numbers in?
[01:41:56] <Matthias|PC> I'm not sure of this is a JS or jQuery question, but why is there a zIndex (as a substitute for z-index) in jQuery?
[01:52:59] <AlmtyBob> GoSox: nope, iterate and use a total variable
[01:55:46] <GoSox> If I'm using jquery to submit a form ajax-ically, then I don't need "name" attributes on my input elements at all, do i?
[01:56:43] <AlmtyBob> depending on your form it might be nice to have them anyway for autocomplete features
[01:56:55] <AlmtyBob> especially if the form will be used multiple times by a given user
[01:57:00] <GoSox> definitely don't need or want auto complete for this form
[01:58:16] <GoSox> well that saves a few bytes
[02:12:05] <hxm> someone experiencied with nicEdit and jquery?

[02:24:08] <GoSox> anyone know how to make a regexp that will check for any character that is NOT one of a specific set I specify

[02:53:54] <Daniel1809> I know it is a big thing... Let's begin in a small way: How to update the email address from the input field in the main document to the email address form in the iFrame form
[02:54:18] <jmmy> Daniel1809, maybe you need nodejs or php
[02:54:46] <Daniel1809> No.... Unfortunately I have to work only with jQuery/javascript and without any third party plugins etc. :S
[02:55:26] <jmmy> Daniel1809, I don't think you can with out some server script.  But they working on some new stuff to work with variables between sites
[02:55:34] <GoSox> if i just want to delete text from inside a div, should i use .empty() or should I just do .html('');
[02:56:01] <jmmy> GoSox, both will work. Probably empty() is better as a guess
[02:58:16] <Daniel1809> I have the information that this could work: jQuery's .contents() method to access the DOM of the document in the iframe... and window.parent.document is a JavaScript expression that specifies the document object of the page that contains the iframe. Written inside the selector, that expression provides the context in which jQuery looks for the div element with the ID my_output:
[02:58:25] <Daniel1809> but I have sadly no idea, where to start :(
[03:00:23] <jmmy> Daniel1809, iframe's suck, I wouldn't bother if I were you
[03:01:10] <Daniel1809> yeah, it sucks... but I can't help it... I have to do my task like this :/
[03:01:28] <jmmy> why?
[03:02:14] <Daniel1809> it is a practical from the university.
[03:02:26] <Daniel1809> they are giving the requirements
[03:02:41] <Daniel1809> but we all are stuck here.... and the teacher is not cooperative
[03:02:42] <jmmy> wierd, they insisting you learn to work with iframe?
[03:02:53] <Daniel1809> it seems so
[03:03:32] <jmmy> I've never touched it personnaly.  I heard it sucks, and I know it sucks, so I never touched it.  But yeah, I see it in use, even by google and yahoo, and big genius company's so I guess you better learn it
[03:03:58] <Daniel1809> hmm... a pity that you can't help
[03:04:52] <jmmy> I 'm just beginner jquery, probably later in the day you will find more help.  It is really early so most people are sleep or busy at work. My quess is evenings are best.
[03:05:19] <Daniel1809> it is 12:05pm here lol
[03:05:25] <diverdude> jmmy, depends on your location on earth ;)
[03:05:32] <GoSox> you guys are on earth?
[03:05:37] <GoSox> eeep wrong channel
[03:05:53] <jmmy> it is 6am.  I'd guess, most people here are in my time zone
[03:06:01] <GoSox> i am
[03:06:04] <GoSox> i ought to go to bed
[03:06:08] <GoSox> but i'm making progress
[03:06:13] <diverdude> Daniel1809, dont use iframes
[03:06:29] <Daniel1809> diverdude... I can show you the task.... it says that I have to do so
[03:06:36] <diverdude> jmmy, you guess wrong then
[03:06:50] <diverdude> Daniel1809, is this homework?
[03:06:56] <GoSox> iframes are a unique element that is valid HTML5, if you are using it for it's unique properties, then that's the best/only way to go
[03:06:56] <jmmy> diverdude, oh, most people in California timezone?
[03:06:57] <Daniel1809> kind of
[03:07:21] <diverdude> Daniel1809, you should read your book then
[03:07:31] <Daniel1809> there is no book, that's the point))
[03:07:43] <Daniel1809> it is more like a "self-study"
[03:07:43] <diverdude> how can you teach with no book
[03:07:44] <jmmy> You can't do animate({ margin-left: '500px'}, ?
[03:07:47] <jmmy> It doesn't work
[03:08:04] <diverdude> Daniel1809, ok...anyway...its not worth studying iframes. its a waste of time
[03:08:23] <diverdude> Daniel1809, iframes are a thing of the past used for various hacks
[03:08:35] <GoSox> iframes are not dead
[03:08:39] <GoSox> and not a hack
[03:08:43] <Daniel1809> okay, how am I supposed to say this to my teacher then? :D
[03:08:54] <diverdude> Daniel1809, yes
[03:09:01] <diverdude> GoSox, yes
[03:09:07] <GoSox> diverdude, no
[03:09:11] <diverdude> yes
[03:10:30] <GoSox> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/HTML5/HTML5_element_list
[03:11:21] <diverdude> GoSox, so?
[03:11:26] <jmmy> You gotto put margin-left in quotes for the .animate() function
[03:11:39] <GoSox> iframe is a valid html5 element
[03:11:58] <diverdude> GoSox, that does not mean it should be used
[03:13:01] <GoSox> ok well why don't you tell the kid that is trying to learn web stuff, that you are just ranting your opinion all over the channel, and that he shouldn't listen to you if he wants to: 1) pass his class and 2) actually learn stuff
[03:15:30] <jmmy> c'mon guys
[03:15:37] <jmmy> You need Jesus
[03:15:38] <jmmy> lol
[03:15:46] <GoSox> that is LITERALLY the last thing I need.
[03:16:02] <jmmy> last but not least?
[03:16:10] <GoSox> last and least
[03:16:22] <jmmy> how about a rant about it?
[03:16:38] <GoSox> if that's what you seek, I may know a guy . . .
[03:17:23] <jmmy> Just kidding.  I am in the jquery mood.  But if we wish to discuss theology, I can spare a few mins, but we'll have to make a separate channel to meet.
[03:17:53] <GoSox> … my answer hasn't changed from 3 minutes ago.
[03:18:23] <jmmy> Did you try twitter bootstrap?
[03:19:11] <jmmy> I am surprised there isn't a responsive framework from jquery.  Jquery itself only has the two site approach as far as I know.
[03:20:16] <jan_n> well, there's a difference between design and funcionality. IMHO it's good that jquery focuses more on functionality and compatibility and leaves design (almost) out of it.
[03:21:01] <jmmy> jan_n, not sure what you mean.  But making two sites isn't bad.  At least you can maximize in each.  When you support both, both suffer.
[03:21:28] <jmmy> When you support both at same time, both are limited
[03:21:57] <jmmy> responsive is best for the designer, not for the web users
[03:22:14] <jmmy> the designer or the web master
[03:22:33] <jan_n> well these days it's also good for marketing to use the buzzword "responsive" ;)
[03:23:12] <jan_n> but yes, I agree to those thoughts. responsive is just as good as the designer's ability to handle it.
[03:23:24] <jmmy> its not exactly so.  The responsive design way is most popular and promoted by the industry leaders
[03:23:28] <gry> (resent) I have a string in a variable named 'line', and a table with id 'mytable'. What do I use to add a new row to the table, which contains only one cell, which contains the variable?
[03:23:55] <jmmy> Its good though.  I like responsive and only offer responsive to my customers
[03:24:42] <jmmy> gry, you can use one of the selectors for child elements to find the last row, and then append the new row to it
[03:24:58] <jan_n> gry: $("#mytable").append("<tr><td>line</td></tr>");
[03:25:31] <jmmy> jan_n, won't that append after the table is closed </table>?
[03:25:59] <jmmy> no eh, it will append within the table of course
[03:26:01] <jan_n> jmmy: nope, http://api.jquery.com/append/
[03:26:40] <jmmy> jan_n, hehe, I haven't worked in ages, I forget so much so quickly
[03:26:57] <jmmy> I get work in spurts.  Mostly drought
[03:27:03] <jan_n> :)
[03:27:48] <jmmy> I am studying .animate() for fun.  Mostly I do jquery for fun.
[03:28:23] <jmmy> I am stuck on the now option.  It is a numeric value of the property being animated at each step, huh?
[03:28:24] <jan_n> I rarely do javascript myself, I just review the code of my colleges / subcontractors.
[03:28:48] <jmmy> jan_n, can I be a subcontractor for you too do you think?  Maybe an easy project to start?
[03:29:32] <jan_n> :) we've teamed up with a company that provides most of our javascripts these days, so not really looking for more at the moment.
[03:30:11] <jmmy> I will undercut them and so double your profit margin. :)
[03:30:41] <jan_n> :)
[03:31:58] <jmmy> You know what I find a lot.  Programmers start project and get a lot done, but in the end, their project is broken, and they want to hire someone for a couple of hours to fix it.  Crazy people eh?
[03:32:48] <jan_n> well, fix it for them and gain som good money.
[03:33:45] <jan_n> Sounds like they need better project planning and/or people that actually have experience.
[03:33:58] <jmmy> find their mistake is just as easy as doing the whole project for them.  They wanna play around and produce a broken design, and then pay you just a fews hours of work for a working design.
[03:34:45] <jmmy> If they can't do it, then hire someone else but pay them then
[03:34:53] <GoSox> that happens to me in my mac repair business. people get a small problem, and keep pushing buttons until they have a big problem. it works out better for the consultant when it's that kind of stuff though, and not web dev
[03:35:09] <jan_n> Well, if you don't get paid properly, you're doing it wrong.
[03:35:14] <GoSox> i learned my lesson long ago, only do web dev for myself, not for anyone else
[03:35:14] <motaka3> can anyone answer my question ?
[03:35:56] <jan_n> There's no point in accepting a project where the pay does not cover the work it takes to fix it.
[03:36:08] <jan_n> If you promise them to fix something in 2 hours and it takes 20, then you are the issue.
[03:36:44] <jmmy> What I mean is, someone play around with say Zend framework, and get a bunch of files built.  But its broken.  And they think they did all the work, and you just came around for a couple hours and fixed it.  So they should collect for 40 hours, and I should collect for just 2hrs.  Thats not fair right? But it doesn't matter cause I rejected the offer.
[03:37:08] <jan_n> jmmy: my point is that you don't care about what they did.
[03:37:21] <jan_n> jmmy: you need to give them an offer where you consider what it would take for you to fix their mess.
[03:37:30] <jmmy> jan_n, yeah true
[03:37:31] <GoSox> jmmy: its fair if you can do it in 2. charge what it takes
[03:37:47] <jan_n> jmmy: and if that offer doesn't cover your costs, then you just fix it anyway if you promised them a fixed price.
[03:38:15] <GoSox> for mac consulting, i charge $80/hr no matter what the issue is and what it will take to fix. One time, I set up this old guy's new Mac, and then I put is ikea desk together for him
[03:38:31] <jan_n> jmmy: or if you can make an estimate, tell them you can only do it on hour basis and setup some checkpoints at specific hours to avoid breaking their budget.
[03:39:36] <jmmy> I always try to raise the price after I make the deal cause I don't get enough customers.  But I keep the original deal, I just try to offer more items. Some people are nice, but some people go crazy.
[03:40:13] <GoSox> why don't you guys just make your own websites, that you can put your own ads on and make your own money
[03:40:17] <GoSox> and not have to deal with clients at all
[03:40:40] <jan_n> jmmy: I wouldn't do that. rather keep what you promised, and make sure you did specifications that avoid you from implementing anything they add after you signed the deal.
[03:40:58] <jan_n> jmmy: anything they ask for that doesn't fit, tell them you will be happy to give htem an offer for it.
[03:42:34] <jmmy> no like, I offer a basic site.  then I offer a contact for extra price, or a search bar for extra price.  And people usually say no, cause they don't want to spend more.  But some people say yes, but include in the price. So they want it but don't want to pay for it.  And once you mention it, they can't go without it.  lol
[03:44:55] <jan_n> GoSox: well, I don't have any issues so I'm all good. :)
[03:45:51] <GoSox> i should go to bed
[03:45:55] <GoSox> brain no workey
[03:47:00] <jan_n> jmmy: well, that's just the way to do it, isn't it? just have clear specifications what your deal includes and that should work just fine.
[03:47:53] <jmmy> jan_n, one guy gave me extra money, like extra $30 on a $450 project.  I think I should have refused it.
[03:48:24] <jmmy> My customer didn't say anything, and if I talk to him, he is still happy, but I don't know, I think maybe deep down, he feels ripped off.
[03:48:34] <jmmy> I regret accepting it.
[03:48:44] <jmmy> But its hard to say no to money.
[03:48:53] <jan_n> jmmy: sorry, I don't follow what you are talking about now.
[03:49:10] <jan_n> you offered an project for 450, and they paid your 480?
[03:49:22] <jmmy> the bill was $450, but he paid and extra $30, and paid $480.
[03:49:25] <jan_n> motaka3: what was your question?
[03:50:05] <jmmy> jan_n, motaka3 didn't say anything
[03:50:23] <jan_n> oh, just asking to ask.
[03:50:45] <jmmy> jan_n, can you help me use the step option of .animate()
[03:51:18] <jmmy> now and fx
[03:51:35] <boytoy> Can somebody help me pause this slider of kittens if the current slide has data-kitten="pause"? http://jsfiddle.net/7n3GC/1/
[03:51:37] <jan_n> jmmy: probably not, I'm not very familiar with animate.
[03:52:06] <jan_n> jmmy: we had a bit of issues with jquerys animations, so for now, we don't use them.
[03:52:25] <jmmy> jan_n, huh, what problem, what do you use instead?
[03:54:32] <jan_n> jmmy: we mainly use this. http://www.greensock.com/gsap-js/
[03:54:53] <jmmy> jan_n, problems with .animate()?
[03:55:14] <jan_n> jmmy: I don't do animations, so I can't comment exactly on what failed. but our creative director and the frontend guys working with animations didn't like it.
[03:55:33] <jan_n> IIRC it was compatibility with different browsers not being smooth enough.
[03:55:46] <jmmy> animations don't end so smoothly, that is one thing for sure
[03:57:14] <jmmy> jan_n, I'm betting your guys encounters these issues for more complicated issue.  For basic simple stuff, it should be fine.
[03:58:04] <jan_n> jmmy: yes.
[04:51:10] <whatever_42> hey. i am using mod_rewrite to make sure that all requests are handled by my server.php file. when i am querying the server directly with firefox everything works fine. how ever when i use ember which uses jquery it says 301 moved permanently. how do i stop this behaviour?
[04:56:59] <gry> now i see why people use jsfiddle, simple things Just Work in it (and never work in the real case)
[04:57:17] <jmmy> gry you need more experience I'm sure
[04:57:22] <gry> it's close to impossible to compile a testcase and ask you do my work; the testcase just works and jsfiddle. that's it.
[04:58:06] <gry> which is a nice thing in a way, too :)
[04:58:31] <jmmy> frig man...nerd talk...what to say...nothing
[05:01:00] <whatever_42> any ideas why jquery tells me that the resource has been moved? the firefox console tells me 200
[05:15:24] <blacksheep> hi
[05:16:19] <blacksheep> is it possible that every action performed on the page triggers particular operation?
[05:16:46] <blacksheep> without writting everything down?
[05:17:28] <xpl0iter2> Hello, for jquery to work is there something the host need to provide?
[05:18:18] <xpl0iter2> I mean this script I wrote is not working for my website: http://pastie.org/private/xanu9hppcvui9bjxem5sow
[05:18:25] <xpl0iter2> Can somebody please help me?
[05:20:22] <blacksheep> on my page it works :)
[05:20:32] <ruffyen> so im trying to figure out why a close icon is not dispalying
[05:20:34] <blacksheep> try with jQuery 1.9
[05:20:44] <ruffyen> http://smv2.uuarner.com/testing# -- if you click add single item
[05:20:50] <ruffyen> you will see what i mean
[05:20:56] <ruffyen> it can get to the images folder
[05:21:09] <ruffyen> but for some reason it will not display the x in the top right corner
[05:29:31] <ruffyen> hmm i seem to have found the problem
[05:29:37] <ruffyen> my server cant find the image file
[05:29:38] <ruffyen> strange
[05:30:27] <jmmy> I like to blame errors mostly on technologies but more mistakes are my own
[05:30:28] <ruffyen> nm
[05:30:35] <ruffyen> it is finding them
[05:30:42] <ruffyen> http://smv2.uuarner.com/static/css/jquery-ui-themes/south-street/images/ui-icons_808080_256x240.png
[05:31:39] <ruffyen> and the file is in the css as the background image
[05:41:50] <FernandoBasso> I am wondering if I can select an image, select the crop area, and only then upload it. I am using 'imageAreaSelect'.
[05:43:02] <obscurant1st> This script is not working when tried from a website, http://pastie.org/private/xanu9hppcvui9bjxem5sow, but on jsfiddle it works fine
[05:43:08] <obscurant1st> Can somebody please help me?
[05:43:25] <lenswipee> Hi, is there a similar function to $('form').serialize() but does json instead?
[05:44:21] <jmmy> obscurant1st, should be easy for you to tell the difference, but difficult for us
[05:44:57] <jmmy> 1.6.4 is really old isn't it?
[05:44:57] <obscurant1st> jmmy What? I didn't get you!
[05:45:18] <obscurant1st> I tried changine it to http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.10.1/jquery.min.js
[05:45:26] <obscurant1st> With no luck obviously
[05:46:02] <obscurant1st> THis is my current code: http://pastie.org/private/62x6m1gbsy2b1z2xhrgjw
[05:47:32] <obscurant1st> BTW this script will work when tried on local system too right?
[05:47:47] <jmmy> lets see your html
[05:47:55] <obscurant1st> Right now I have stopeed uploading to the website each time I make an edit. so..
[05:48:00] <obscurant1st> ok once sec.
[05:49:10] <jmmy> hmm, doesn't work for me
[05:49:17] <obscurant1st> jmmy I have pm'ed you the entire html.
[05:50:11] <jmmy> its enough
[05:51:14] <jmmy> do you still have it working on jsfiddle?
[05:51:28] <obscurant1st> Yes
[05:52:05] <obscurant1st> jmmy sent the jsfiddle link.
[05:52:15] <jmmy> why are you sending in pvt, maybe someone else might wanna follow along with us too
[05:52:42] <jmmy> cool, looks like mouseenter is old news dude
[05:52:50] <jmmy> don't use it anymore, or get the old jquery
[05:53:00] <obscurant1st> oh ok.
[05:53:11] <jmmy> obscurant1st, probably should use css anyway
[05:53:41] <obscurant1st> I can use css for this? I need to check that then. Thanks
[05:53:44] <jmmy> also require jquery ui
[05:54:03] <jmmy> no I don't think you can do it with css actually
[05:54:15] <jmmy> but you definitely need ui because without it checked it doesn't work
[05:54:24] <obscurant1st> ok.
[05:54:40] <jmmy> yeah so you can use the new jquery, I was wrong about that, but you must also use jquery ui
[05:54:41] <apdmatos> obscurant1st use this jquery plugi
[05:54:44] <apdmatos> http://www.bitstorm.org/jquery/color-animation/
[05:54:59] <apdmatos> i think you'll need it to play with colors
[05:55:04] <obscurant1st> Ok thanks.
[05:55:05] <obscurant1st> :)
[05:55:14] <apdmatos> not sure
[05:55:16] <obscurant1st> Thanks jmmy too! :D
[05:55:21] <apdmatos> just test and say something
[05:55:23] <apdmatos> then
[05:55:23] <jmmy> obscurant1st, looks cool
[05:55:35] <obscurant1st> ok
[06:13:44] <obscurant1st> I included this "http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.9.1.js" and it worked! :d
[06:31:03] <jmmy> seems like the html for the "Step Function" example of the .animate() method is missing -http://api.jquery.com/animate/
[06:31:48] <Daniel1809> I have a select list with 20 entries (movies). Below this list I have a text input field. The set of entries displayed in the <select> box should be narrowed down to those whose text contain the sequence of characters entered in that text input field so far. How to do that? Here is my site: http://jsfiddle.net/RRMF7/
[06:32:27] <Daniel1809> I have heard that it is possible with the .keyup() handler... but how to integrate it here?
[06:33:04] <jmmy> Daniel1809, jquery ui is a perfect tool for you
[06:33:41] <jmmy> http://jqueryui.com/autocomphttp://jqueryui.com/autocomplete/lete/
[06:33:45] <jmmy> http://jqueryui.com/autocomplete/
[06:36:17] <jop008> I have this <select name="type" id="type" multiple="multiple" data-native-menu="false"> and dynamicly add options to it like this document.rental_object.type.options[i] = new Option(field.description, field.typeID, false, lselected);
[06:36:18] <jop008>         });
[06:36:43] <jop008> and also a change trigger my options are not shown on the page
[06:37:39] <Daniel1809> I am not allowed to use any third party plugins or tools. I have to code it myself.... In this case with the keyup.() event handler... :S
[06:38:20] <jmmy> Daniel1809, you can probably read the code from the jquery ui
[06:39:34] <Daniel1809> How to apply the jquery ui to my case? I never used it...
[06:40:46] <jmmy> What I mean is, if you want to learn how they made the autocomplete, you can read the source code.  Probably they used keyup eh
[06:41:19] <jmmy> Daniel1809, Otherwise, what is your question then?
[06:43:47] <Daniel1809> My question is, how to connect the text input field with my select list in order the select list will be narrowed down to the text from the input field with the same characters.
[06:44:01] <Daniel1809> http://jsfiddle.net/RRMF7/
[06:44:47] <Daniel1809> for example: if you are typing 1994... then only the films with 1994 in the title should be displayed in the list then :)
[06:46:01] <jmmy> I'm not sure what the best way to do it is.  You gotta compile the list into jquery somehow.  I guess you gonna have to break each list item string into arrays or its individual letters, like for movie Inception become [i][n][c][e]...ption
[06:46:28] <jmmy> Daniel1809, Must be only in jquery or you can use server scripts and/or sql?
[06:47:30] <Daniel1809> only jquery...
[06:47:54] <jmmy> Daniel1809, ok, 1 sec
[06:49:13] <jmmy> Daniel1809, Are you allowed to edit the html?
[06:49:22] <Daniel1809> yes
[06:50:39] <jmmy> Daniel1809, Actually, you don't need to, it is already setup the way I thinking to set it up.  So the value is equal to the text which is big clue to what your prof is expecting
[06:50:50] <thaifood> Anyone know how to change my lines 23 and 24 to work for an unlimited number of songs ?  http://fpaste.org/17416/37069940/
[06:50:53] <jmmy> Daniel1809, Did you check out the .find() method
[06:55:03] <Daniel1809> I don't think that I have to use the .find() method... I have to work with the .keyup() event handler.... :S
[06:55:32] <jmmy> yeah keyup() to call the find() method or some other filtering method
[06:56:17] <jmmy> your find() or filter() or whatever traversing function you use is inside the keyup() function
[06:56:56] <jmmy> http://api.jquery.com/category/traversing/filtering/
[06:58:52] <sja_> I'm struggling with the taxonomy of JQuery in relation to Javascript; is it a library or a DSL?
[07:01:05] <jmmy> sja_, I guess you can think of it as a layer on top of javascript.  You use javascript code inside jquery code no problem
[07:01:31] <jmmy> what's dsl stand for?
[07:01:58] <sja_> domain specific language
[07:01:59] <jmmy> Its a library of javascript
[07:03:10] <thaifood> Anyone know how to change my lines 23 and 24 to work for an unlimited number of songs ?  http://fpaste.org/17416/37069940/
[07:29:53] <_rgn> thaifood: select all audio elements and set the volume for each of them
[07:29:54] <juboba> how can I capture when a checkbox has been checked or unchecked without using onclick? This is because in my form the checkbox could be clicked on or checked programatically
[07:30:08] <thaifood> _rgn, how
[07:30:27] <thaifood> that's where i'm stuck
[07:30:30] <juboba> .change() fires only onclick...
[07:30:38] <_rgn> juboba: dom mutation observer might work, no idea how to do taht with jquery
[07:30:56] <_rgn> thaifood: read about jquery selectors
[07:31:04] <_rgn> this is not a difficult problem
[07:31:18] <thaifood> it is here
[07:31:21] <juboba> _rgn, what is that?
[07:31:35] <thaifood> how do you "select all audio elements"
[07:32:04] <thaifood> *audio   ?
[07:32:12] <thaifood> using universal ?
[07:32:27] <juboba> _rgn thanks
[07:32:41] <_rgn> thaifood: how do you select all p elements?
[07:32:50] <thaifood> no idea
[07:32:53] <_rgn> lol
[07:32:56] <juboba> $('p')
[07:33:18] <juboba> thaifood, you should know that jQuery captures elements by css
[07:33:24] <_rgn> if you don't know the basics you haven't even tried yourself
[07:33:36] <thaifood> i'm old and feeble
[07:34:22] <juboba> thaifood, if you're not blind you can read: www.jquery.com
[07:34:37] <thaifood> this did not work    $('audio').volume = ui.value;
[07:34:59] <juboba> thaifood, you're messing with html5 spec
[07:35:07] <juboba> you should read about that too
[07:35:26] <thaifood> currently i have to do  audio1.volume = ui.value;  and then audio2.volume = ui.value;  for each audio control
[07:35:40] <_rgn> thaifood: $() returns a jquery collection, and volume is a property of the node itself
[07:36:11] <juboba> thaifood, you should use document.getElementById('audio_id').play(), etc
[07:36:34] <thaifood> nevermind
[07:36:47] <juboba> thaifood, it's not that hard
[07:37:00] <juboba> thaifood, what is it you're playing?
[07:37:05] <juboba> thaifood, sound?
[07:37:08] <thaifood> yup
[07:37:22] <juboba> are you showing controls?
[07:37:26] <thaifood> yes
[07:37:30] <juboba> then?
[07:37:36] <juboba> don't they work?
[07:37:37] <thaifood> and want to bind one volume to all of them
[07:37:44] <thaifood> currently i have to do  audio1.volume = ui.value;  and then audio2.volume = ui.value;  for each audio control
[07:37:51] <juboba> ohh
[07:37:52] <thaifood> and with 50 controls that gets messy
[07:38:05] <juboba> sure
[07:38:07] <thaifood> audio50.volume ...
[07:38:23] <juboba> audio1 is the id of the element?
[07:38:27] <_rgn> you need: $(), jQuery#each, this.volume = 1
[07:38:34] <juboba> exactly
[07:38:36] <thaifood> yes juboba
[07:38:46] <juboba> but you need at least a class to get things cleaner
[07:38:49] <juboba> you can say
[07:39:02] <thaifood> class i player
[07:39:10] <juboba> <audio class="themess" id="audio1">...</audio>
[07:39:12] <juboba> and then
[07:39:22] <thaifood> http://fpaste.org/17422/70235513/
[07:39:39] <juboba> $('.themess').each(function(){ this.volume = theval});
[07:40:23] <juboba> thaifood, you know u can use only one player for all songs?
[07:40:34] <thaifood> no idea
[07:41:44] <thaifood> i get no vol ctrl with   $('.player').each(function(){ this.volume = theval});
[07:41:58] <_rgn> oh my god
[07:42:10] <_rgn> this guy is not thinking for himself
[07:42:15] <thaifood> _rgn, stop being a drama queen
[07:42:40] <_rgn> go try #jquery-spoonfeeding
[07:42:49] <juboba> hahaha
[07:42:55] <thaifood> he's so gay
[07:42:59] <juboba> thaifood, you can read about this
[07:43:06] <thaifood>  i see ui.value
[07:43:09] <thaifood> let me fix it
[07:43:09] <juboba> it's really not that hard
[07:43:29] <thaifood> now it works
[07:43:37] <thaifood> $('.player').each(function(){ this.volume = ui.value});
[07:43:57] <thaifood> thank you juboba and no thanks to _rgn
[07:44:10] <thaifood> so juboba  what did you mean i can play them all from one control ?
[07:44:43] <thaifood> this works really well, thanks juboba
[07:44:50] <thaifood> http://www.sunriverstudios.com/music.php
[07:45:04] <juboba> huh?
[07:45:10] <juboba> oh
[07:45:27] <thaifood> <juboba> thaifood, you know u can use only one player for all songs?
[07:46:22] <vsync_> i like this, when you start the players a few seconds apart from eachother
[07:46:35] <thaifood> yeah you can make a mash up !
[07:46:47] <juboba> thaifood, that's nice
[07:46:51] <thaifood> or create a round
[07:47:20] <juboba> thaifood, check on google for html5 audio playlist
[07:47:27] <juboba> I have to go now
[07:47:43] <thaifood> thanks !!!
[07:47:45] <thaifood> you rock
[07:47:46] <juboba> have a nice time coding!
[07:47:48] <juboba> haha
[07:47:53] <juboba> I see you rock I program
[07:47:54] <juboba> hahaha
[07:48:06] <juboba> I'll program for food
[07:48:08] <juboba> xD
[07:48:11] <juboba> bye!
[07:48:11] <thaifood> heheh
[07:48:19] <thaifood> i'll mix your songs for free
[08:16:24] <Mohsen_Hassani> Is this correct? $("#transaction_type").on('change load', function() {});
[08:16:37] <Mohsen_Hassani> I mean I want to trigger two events for one object
[08:16:55] <Mohsen_Hassani> it's not triggered on page load.
[08:19:43] <_rgn> Mohsen_Hassani: have you wrapped that in $()
[08:20:09] <Mohsen_Hassani> _rgn, I have wrapped it in $(document).ready();
[08:20:51] <Mohsen_Hassani> _rgn, #transaction_type is a combobox
[08:20:53] <_rgn> and it works without "change"?
[08:21:17] <Mohsen_Hassani> _rgn, it worked without "load". I need it to work also on page load.
[08:33:40] <Mohsen_Hassani> _rgn, I ended up with removing 'load', and: $("#the_combobox").trigger('change');
[08:38:51] <wer0ckz> Hi Guys. Help please. I got an error value 'NaN' to get total number of year/months (result should be something like 1.2 yrs, 3.1 yrs etc.) - My jsfiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/Jfx9A/1/
[08:39:24] <wer0ckz> var total_dd1 = Math.abs(current_date-datepicker / (1000 * 60 * 60 * 24)); <-- seems to be not working
[08:41:49] <_rgn> wer0ckz: heh, you're expecting JS to just magically figure out your strings are dates and substract them?
[08:42:10] <wer0ckz> checking
[08:42:38] <wer0ckz> i see
[08:42:53] <wer0ckz> so do i need to convert them to something like integer? please help
[08:43:36] <dabear> ?jseval typeof +"1000"
[08:43:38] <_rgn> date object or timestamp as integer
[08:43:39] <bot-t> dabear: "number"
[08:44:41] <wer0ckz> like parse date? sorry im still really new to jquery
[08:44:59] <_rgn> this is a javascript problem, not jquery
[08:45:19] <wer0ckz> copy that. thanks
[08:48:18] <onenine90> is there a way to get rid of a div and its children for a while and then place it back in the HTML structure later lol
[08:48:37] <onenine90> display none wont work because I am using strict
[08:49:30] <Yusuf> Mohsen_Hassani, There is no load event for input elements
[08:50:03] <Mohsen_Hassani> Yusuf, oh! :) Is there something special? Or nothing?
[08:50:25] <onenine90> nvm we good
[08:52:07] <gnarf> ?detach @onenine90
[08:52:08] <bot-t> onenine90, .detach([selector]): Remove the set of matched elements from the DOM. http://api.jquery.com/detach/
[08:52:25] <onenine90> thanks gnarf
[08:52:26] <_rgn> wer0ckz: you can get the date object of selected date with $("#datepicker").datepicker('getDate');
[08:53:06] <_rgn> from there you can just subtract one from the another and Math.abs
[08:53:07] <Yusuf> Mohsen_Hassani, handle it on window  object when its loaded
[08:53:15] <_rgn> wer0ckz: then format the result into years
[08:54:04] <wer0ckz> i'll try
[08:54:17] <Ungy> when using load is there any way to load javascript?
[08:55:40] <Ungy> I am using load to insert some html from another page on my site but there is an associated JavaScript object I also need to load putting into a script tab gets stripped any ideas on how I can pull this one off?
[08:57:29] <wer0ckz> _rgn: http://jsfiddle.net/Jfx9A/2/ <- its still not working. tried the $("#datepicker").datepicker('getDate');
[08:58:17] <_rgn> wer0ckz: dude, you're not even using the variable...
[08:59:09] <wer0ckz> oh sorry 1 sec
[08:59:48] <_rgn> protip: use console.log(variable) and check from the console what the return values are
[08:59:50] <wer0ckz> var total_dd1 = Math.ceil(current_date-current_date / (1000 * 60 * 60 * 24));
[08:59:57] <wer0ckz> http://jsfiddle.net/Jfx9A/3/
[09:00:23] <wer0ckz> how about the current date? do i also need to convert?
[09:00:42] <_rgn> still not using the variable
[09:00:42] <_rgn> take a moment and think it through
[09:00:44] <wer0ckz> var total_dd1 = Math.ceil(current_date-date_selected / (1000 * 60 * 60 * 24));
[09:00:46] <Ungy> wouldn't it be date_selected-current_date

[09:01:07] <wer0ckz> i got the variable corrected this time
[09:01:20] <_rgn> current_date is a string, you don't want a string, no reason to use the formatDate()
[09:01:50] <wer0ckz> checking
[09:02:00] <DeltaHeavy> If I want to append to content within a <span>, is it preferred to just use .append(), or: $('span').text($('span').text() + newContent);       ?
[09:07:35] <[E]sc> I'm using FormData to upload using ajax but everytime I click on "Choose A File", it chains them together, uploading one file for as many times I click "Choose A File"; Is there a way to clear that FormData?  i tried resetting it via declaring it false, but it still does that.
[09:10:46] <wer0ckz> <_rgn> current_date is a string, you don't want a string, no reason to use the formatDate() <- i cant find current date other than formatDate. is there another way?
[09:12:33] <_rgn> you are already using it in your code
[09:13:38] <wer0ckz> so my problem now is the current date that needs to convert into number?
[09:13:52] <_rgn> no
[09:13:54] <Ungy> dude seriously
[09:14:18] <_rgn> wer0ckz: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date
[09:14:23] <_rgn> read the first line of code under Syntax
[09:14:29] <ruffyen> just in case anyone was following along
[09:14:30] <_rgn> find that piece of code in your code
[09:14:38] <ruffyen> i fixed my top right close image issue
[09:14:39] <wer0ckz> ok checking
[09:14:45] <ruffyen> it was the ordering of my .js files
[09:15:00] <ruffyen> another lib i was using was killing the images method i guess
[09:16:09] <wer0ckz> got it
[09:17:30] <wer0ckz> _rgn: i think i'm really almost there. http://jsfiddle.net/Jfx9A/5/ - but its still not subtracting
[09:17:38] <wer0ckz> i changed it to current_date = date();
[09:18:05] <_rgn> and that is wrong
[09:18:12] <_rgn> you're not paying attention to anything
[09:18:18] <Ungy> var curDate = new Date();  curDate = curDate.now();
[09:18:46] <Ungy> wait what am I doing
[09:19:01] <Ungy> var curDate = Date.now();
[09:19:31] <Ungy> var userDate = new Date();
[09:20:39] <wer0ckz> oh my
[09:20:51] <wer0ckz> var  current_date = new date(); is working
[09:21:06] <wer0ckz> my bad sorry for my noobness
[09:21:08] <wer0ckz> thank you so much
[09:22:25] <_rgn> seriously, if i'd like you to learn anything from this it's that USE console.log to see what's in your variable and don't blindly run code and wonder why it's not working
[09:23:27] <Ungy> wer0ckz what teh hell are you trying to do?
[09:27:13] <Bloomberg> Morning guys!!
[09:30:16] <Burian> What is the best way to preserve the $(this) variable in a nested .on('click'...  i.e. utilize the parent $(this) inside of the child.  I have tried setting a variable to equal $(this) outside of the child click, however it does not appear to update on subsequent clicks.
[09:31:10] <_rgn> Burian: put your code on jsfiddle
[09:33:57] <Ungy> Burian var parentThis = this; before you go into it
[09:34:00] <Ungy> tadah
[09:34:20] <Burian> _rgn: Will do
[09:34:36] <Burian> Ungy: I have tried that, but the var appears to not update on subsequent clicks
[09:35:51] <Ungy> wtf are you trying to do it will only be set on the initial bind
[09:38:37] <Burian> Ungy: Make reusable code?  Not have a function for each specific button
[09:39:25] <_rgn> it's pointless to guess what you might be doing wrong. you need to show code
[09:40:14] <Ungy> Burian and that means what?
[09:40:35] <Ungy> I write reusable code 7 days a week 10 hours a day
[09:40:56] <Burian> _rgn: http://jsfiddle.net/yGHnb/
[09:43:42] <Ungy> Burian so you only want a single menu to be pushed out
[09:45:19] <Burian> Yes, the same menu elements are reused for multiple buttons
[09:45:25] <Ungy> Burian just update $("#menu_filter").attr("data-parentbutton", $(this).attr("id"));
[09:45:36] <Ungy> then you always know which one spawned it
[09:46:11] <Ungy> but you need a unique id on yoru buttons
[09:46:17] <Burian> Ungy: That's a good idea, Thanks
[10:35:33] <wer0ckz> help abount counting number of years please. http://jsfiddle.net/Jfx9A/6/ <-- something is wrong with my formula or is there something wrong with the variable that needs to convert?
[10:40:35] <_rgn> your formula doesn't work
[10:43:06] <_rgn> var date_selected = new Date(2012, 10, 5);
[10:43:06] <_rgn> var current_date = new Date();
[10:43:17] <_rgn> put this into developer console and figure it out without datepicker
[10:43:34] <wer0ckz> i'll try now
[10:49:52] <wer0ckz> _rgn: http://jsfiddle.net/Jfx9A/8/ - i got Total of Year/Month: 1370713769040
[10:51:28] <_rgn> you're completely misunderstanding me
[10:51:35] <_rgn> i want you to open developer console
[10:51:40] <_rgn> paste my two variables there
[10:51:48] <_rgn> and figure out the formula interactively
[10:52:02] <wer0ckz> im using firebug
[10:52:03] <wer0ckz> 1 sec
[10:53:00] <_rgn> http://cl.ly/image/2m1c0W470m1G
[10:53:02] <_rgn> and then you go from there
[10:53:19] <wer0ckz> ok
[10:53:30] <_rgn> you'll get realtime feedback on what's working and what isn't
[10:54:19] <wer0ckz> got it
[10:54:22] <_rgn> tip: the result of subtracting the variables is milliseconds
[10:54:28] <wer0ckz> current_date - date_selected
[10:54:29] <wer0ckz> 	18669162253
[10:54:41] <wer0ckz> whats my next step please
[11:01:50] <wer0ckz> current_date - date_selected = 18669162253 (milliseconds?) how to convert them to year?
[11:02:50] <_rgn> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8211744/convert-milliseconds-or-seconds-into-human-readable-form
[11:02:52] <_rgn> your answer is there
[11:19:12] <Ebonwumon> I have an array of elements. Is there a quick way of checking if every element in the array has a certain class, short of making a for and iterating through?
[11:21:10] <_rgn> filter
[11:21:14] <_rgn> at least
[11:44:38] <jmmy> !l
[12:28:15] <_rgn> wer0ckz: did you figure it out
[12:32:29] <Ungy> wer0ckz var yearinmil = (100 * 60 * 60 * 24 * 365); var years = difference / yearinmil;
[12:35:47] <AlmtyBob> so just for the sake of practice I'm making a tie picker using a sliding interface similar to: http://designm.ag/previews/ios-content-slider/ .   Let's say I have 50 ties, I'll have an image of each laid out horizontally across the page.  As I slide, the center tie will be selected and opaque while the rest have a transparency.  My question is: how do I do the HTML markup for that?
[12:44:33] <dalnet22> I'm having a problem where $.POST is sending a JSON.stringify(array) to PHP with escape quotes, resulting in this format: [{\"x\":1}]. However I want it to send to PHP as [{"x":1}]. When I output in javascript before doing the $.POST, it doesn't have the escape quotes, so the issue occurs when the data is sent.

[13:46:55] <wer0ckz> help please about global variable. http://jsfiddle.net/LgTZt/21/ <- how can i make 'reduction' variable set to global? it's inside a function
[13:48:15] <shoky> wer0ckz: put it outside the function?
[13:48:38] <wer0ckz> i cant. its inside the datepicker
[13:48:45] <wer0ckz> can i duplicate it?
[13:49:03] <shoky> why cant .. why do you want it global anyway
[13:49:29] <wer0ckz> it needs to calculate the amount. did you check my jsfiddle?
[13:50:06] <shoky> so what?
[13:50:26] <wer0ckz> im not sure how to do it
[13:50:28] <shoky> there.. now it's outside  http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/LgTZt/22/
[13:50:38] <wer0ckz> checking
[13:50:41] <wer0ckz> thank you for helping
[14:03:51] <Daniel1809> I have a simple tooltip on my site: http://jsfiddle.net/Dtf9e/   I HAVE TO set the options as a comma-separated list in the data attribute in the <a> tag... But it is not working? Why??
[14:07:16] <Daniel1809> Nobody? :(
[14:09:23] <shoky> Daniel1809: what's not working?
[14:10:19] <Daniel1809> see the data "list"? why are these settings not applied in the output? For example, the background color (bgc)
[14:10:56] <shoky> Daniel1809: why would they be applied? you're not doing anything with that data attribute
[14:13:02] <Daniel1809> I am also very confused in this... but the task says that I should these options in the data attribute... :S
[14:13:14] <Daniel1809> So I have to write something else, right?
[14:13:28] <Daniel1809> *should set
[14:13:30] <shoky> Daniel1809: yes. that code isn't even reading the data attribute..
[14:14:54] <Daniel1809> what shall I write in order the set in the data tag will be visible in the output?
[14:16:14] <shoky> Daniel1809: you'd have to read the attribute, parse it, and apply the actual stuff it says.. your code would need to know what each of those settings mean, and apply each one based on the meaning..
[14:17:48] <shoky> Daniel1809: and that isn't a very simple thing to do if you're confused about this..
[14:18:00] <shoky> you'd have to know what you were doing
[14:18:32] <shoky> (or blindly follow a "task" that specifies it..)
[14:20:44] <Daniel1809> At the moment my brain is nearly at the end... even when it seems to be simple...
[14:21:32] <Daniel1809> May you could give me a start with a code?
[14:21:47] <shoky> uhm
[14:21:56] <shoky> var data = $(this).attr('data');
[14:22:05] <shoky> that gets you the data attribute as a string..
[14:22:28] <shoky> data.split(',')  gives you an array of each "setting"
[14:22:41] <shoky> i'm not gonna write the whole thing for you, sorry
[14:23:29] <shoky> sounds like you need a better tutorial to follow
[14:23:39] <shoky> ?learn
[14:23:39] <bot-t> First learn JavaScript (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/learn/javascript) then learn jQuery (http://jqfundamentals.com/)
[14:25:43] <Daniel1809> Really, we just got a massive documentation about this and no in-class lessons with real personal teaching... that's why it is so hard for me to realize what I could really do with the "standard code"
[14:25:48] <Daniel1809> anyway, thanks!
[15:44:13] <Zxurian> can anyone recommend a decent plugin for highlighting a section of a page, similiar to http://foliotek.github.io/unmodal/, but will allow me to add padding around the element I want to highlight?
[15:44:20] <FernandoBasso> I am sending an image with ajax, but it always give the name of the image back as a response, messing up with other values I am returning from the server. Any ideas?
[15:45:58] <FernandoBasso> I mean, even if I don't even have a server script waiting for something, it see "image-name.jpg" in the "Response" tab of firebug.
[15:48:29] <Eviltwin> Zxurian: I'm guessing your best bet is to modify unmodal
[15:49:08] <Eviltwin> If you're in a rush a nasty CSS hack is to do something like .myUnModalElement { padding: 20px; margin: -20px; }
[15:49:54] <Zxurian> that's my plan B, I'm just surprised there isn't an established  plugin already out there for something like this
[15:51:44] <Eviltwin> Zxurian: If you're up for modifying the plugin
[15:51:53] <Eviltwin> Looks like you can just modify these 3 lines: https://github.com/Foliotek/unmodal/blob/master/unmodal.js#L118-120
[15:52:21] <Eviltwin> After the first one add rect.left -= myFavoriteLeftPadding
[15:52:30] <Eviltwin> rect.top -= myFavoriteTopPadding
[15:52:53] <Eviltwin> And for the other two lines do rect.width = node.outerWidth() + myFavoriteLeftPadding + myFavoriteRightPadding;
[15:52:59] <Eviltwin> And equivalent change for rect.height
[15:53:16] <Zxurian> interesting, I'll checkout modifying that
[15:53:33] <karlmh> yeah, u could just fork it and modify that pretty quickly
[15:53:40] <karlmh> github is sweet
[15:53:48] <Zxurian> the other issue I had with similar plugins I tried, was that it promoted the div to highlight via z-index, which doesn't work for div's that don't have their own background
[15:53:51] <Eviltwin> And it doesn't have to be a fork in a formal capacity like that
[15:54:10] <Eviltwin> It can just be download & change a few lines before putting it on your server
[15:54:43] <Zxurian> yea, I'll probably end up changing teh code, and creating a fork just so other people can use it, was just making sure there wasn't an established one out tehre already that someone might have heard of
[15:55:44] <Eviltwin> I'd be too embarrassed to do a real fork without coming up with some elegant mechanism for adding variable padding on each element
[15:56:00] <Eviltwin> That's backwards compatible with the existing plugin
[15:56:07] <Zxurian> yea, I'd be adding options/settings, etc..
[16:57:21] <Moleboy> Hey, can someone tell me if there's anything wrong with this code? it's like...3 lines long xD
[16:57:22] <Moleboy> http://pastebin.com/VDEXMLWe
[16:57:57] <momomomomo_> Moleboy: Can you explain what's wrong with / not working?
[16:58:30] <Moleboy> momomomomo_: when I hover, the color doesn't change
[16:59:01] <momomomomo_> so I think you want an event like http://api.jquery.com/on/
[16:59:37] <Moleboy> momomomomo_: out of curiousity, why would it not be working now?
[17:00:33] <Moleboy> I just feel like I've done stuff similar to this, and wondering why this piece of code doesn't work :-/
[17:00:48] <shoky> Moleboy: you have a <navbar> element?
[17:00:57] <momomomomo_> oh you know what, it's not that shoky
[17:00:59] <momomomomo_> it's the class
[17:01:04] <momomomomo_> it should be navbar.li Moleboy
[17:01:10] <Moleboy> ohhhhhhhh
[17:01:11] <shoky> .navbar li  you mean
[17:01:19] <Moleboy> AHHH dangit
[17:01:21] <Moleboy> it was so obvious
[17:01:22] <Moleboy> :X
[17:01:27] <momomomomo_> whichever are classes should be prefixed witha period
[17:01:29] <Moleboy> stupid mistake
[17:01:32] <Moleboy> yea, I know
[17:01:35] <Moleboy> I just was so unfocused
[17:01:37] <Moleboy> :X
[17:01:39] <momomomomo_> li isn't the class, so I was wrong just there
[17:01:39] <Moleboy> And id's with #
[17:01:41] <Moleboy> augh
[17:01:50] <shoky> it's ok dude, chill ;p
[17:01:55] <Moleboy> I'm so sorry for bothering y'all, I shouldn't have overlooked that
[17:01:58] <Moleboy> xD
[17:02:04] <momomomomo_> Moleboy: no problem
[17:04:27] <Moleboy> momomomomo_: shoky: Ok, I'm back. It's still not working. I'm gonna post a JSfiddle to see if I can pinpoint the issue
[17:13:00] <Moleboy> momomomomo_: http://jsfiddle.net/RCajT/
[17:13:19] <Moleboy> it works on there, it turns green. I realize I want mouseenter/mouseleave instead, but I have a bigger issue
[17:13:23] <Moleboy> it isn't working locally ;___;
[17:14:07] <shoky> Moleboy: <head> shouldn't be in <body>
[17:14:36] <shoky> Moleboy: and if your script.js does jquery, it should be included after jquery
[17:15:46] <torbjorn> how can I know the status of a toggle button? (created from a checkbox input)
[17:17:02] <shoky> torbjorn:  .is(':checked')  or .prop('checked')  on the checkbox
[17:17:25] <torbjorn> thanks!
[17:17:39] <Moleboy> shoky: fixed it locally, saved everything, and it's still not working locally :( I can't figure out the problem!
[17:17:49] <Moleboy> shoky: http://jsfiddle.net/RCajT/1/
[17:17:50] <Moleboy> I updated it
[17:17:50] <shoky> Moleboy: check your javascript console for errors
[17:18:41] <funhouse> found the best scrollbar plugin
[17:18:51] <Moleboy> shoky: Good work! Your JavaScript code is perfectly valid. and also, that would be weird that it would work on jsfiddle but not locally :X
[17:19:11] <shoky> Moleboy:  what?
[17:19:46] <shoky> Moleboy: press F12 and look for your javascript console
[17:20:13] <Moleboy> shoky: in my browser?
[17:20:29] <shoky> Moleboy: yes. get familiar with the browser's devtools
[17:20:57] <Moleboy> shoky: f12 in firefox isn't doing anything
[17:21:06] <Moleboy> shoky: I'll check another browser
[17:21:12] <shoky> Moleboy: i think it should.. install firebug then
[17:21:20] <shoky> Moleboy: or look for the console in firefox menus
[17:21:38] <shoky> or yeah, use chrome devtools
[17:22:38] <Moleboy> shoky: aha, now it works, it just needed firebug hehe, thanks, I"ll check it out

[18:07:25] <lenswipe> hey guys
[18:07:40] <lenswipe> anyone know why the success callbacks on this: http://pastebin.com/wNrvDwR5 are never being run?
[18:11:22] <shoky> lenswipe: is the http request successful?
[18:11:26] <lenswipe> yeah
[18:11:36] <lenswipe> it makes the changes and I see the changes in the db
[18:11:43] <shoky> lenswipe:  type  not method
[18:11:47] <lenswipe> huh?
[18:12:07] <shoky> type: 'post'
[18:12:13] <lenswipe> ah
[18:12:18] <lenswipe> fixed that
[18:12:23] <lenswipe> it's still nto working :(
[18:12:35] <shoky> lenswipe: but is the request successful in your browser's devtools network tab
[18:12:43] <shoky> do you see the response
[18:12:57] <lenswipe> yes it is successful
[18:13:07] <lenswipe> there isn't a response (my controller doesn't send one)
[18:13:20] <lenswipe> but I do see a 200 in chrome console
[18:14:02] <shoky> add an error handler anyways.. donno what the prob is, the code seems fine. except for the alert instead of console.log
[18:15:01] <shoky> lenswipe: is that a cross-domain request
[18:16:21] <shoky> cross-origin
[18:18:03] <funhouse> Does anyone know of any good fireworks animation plugins?
[18:18:10] <lenswipe> shoky, nope
[18:18:11] <funhouse> Or some cool particle effects?
[18:18:43] <lenswipe> shoky, besides which, if it was the request wouldnt be successful
[18:19:59] <shoky> lenswipe: and your original page is loaded from the webserver yeah? not local filesystem
[18:20:46] <lenswipe> dafuq
[18:21:01] <lenswipe> shoky, apparently the error callback is being run
[18:21:05] <lenswipe> not sure wh
[18:21:07] <lenswipe> why
[18:21:50] <lenswipe> shoky, aha!
[18:21:56] <lenswipe> it was because my controller wasn't sending any output
[18:22:02] <lenswipe> I make it spit out "OK" now
[18:22:46] <shoky> lenswipe: oh. maybe dataType: 'text'  would fix that too
[18:23:29] <shoky> or sending a text content-type in the response, maybe
[18:25:54] <lenswipe> yeah. maybe
[18:28:06] <relipse> anyone good with jquery-ui, how can I add a separator/divider between my menu() items ?
[18:30:22] <relipse> anyone have an answer to this question: http://forum.jquery.com/topic/jquery-ui-menu-make-an-item-separator
[18:30:25] <relipse> shoky?
[18:32:11] <relipse> hmm looks like <li><hr></li> is a cheap way to do it
[18:40:50] <shankstaBytes> shoky: ya thats what i meant, but its reporting it as false even though the item is visible
[18:41:11] <shankstaBytes> if I hide it then show it again it returns true
[18:41:32] <shankstaBytes> but for some reason just that one time it isn't triggered properly\
[18:51:28] <Zxurian> is there an issue with clicks on svg events not bubbling up?
[18:51:35] <Zxurian> *elements
[19:04:43] <shoky> shankstaBytes: need a jsfiddle/demo
[19:05:28] <relipse> how do i make an hr look cool
[19:06:37] <coldhead> css3 animations
[19:06:37] <b-ot> coldhead: You have 1 new message, use `read when you wish to read it.
[19:28:38] <shankstaBytes> shoky: ill try and make one, but it is pretty complex already
[19:36:17] <coldhead> make it less complex
[19:39:55] <relipse> hey shoky can you help me out
[19:43:10] <relipse> can someone help me out, i put margin-bottom: -30px and now the <a href is unclickable?
[19:44:13] <_rgn> yah lemme grab my crystal ball and have a look at your code
[19:46:26] <coldhead> lol
[19:48:52] <shoky> relipse: ^^

[20:41:58] <gry> http://jsfiddle.net/gryllida/W8gzH/ what to use instead of .innerHTML to get textarea contents?
[20:46:00] <shoky> gry:  field.value or $(field).val()
[20:47:13] <arnorhs> gry: http://jsfiddle.net/W8gzH/1/
[20:49:01] <gry> I also tried .val() and it didn't work saying .val() is not a function, why does .value work but not .val()?
[20:49:51] <shoky> gry:  $(field).val()
[20:49:53] <shoky> not field.val()
[20:50:21] <gry> ok, I understand. what is a proper name for the "$()" thing?
[20:50:35] <shoky> it returns a jquery object
[20:50:53] <gry> yes, I see. but does it have a name? it it an operator, a selector, a ...?
[20:51:03] <shoky> $ is a function
[20:51:12] <gry> ok
[21:15:04] <acidjazz> why did htey remove jQuery.browser .. wtf am i supposed to use now
[21:15:47] <shoky> feature detect
[21:16:54] <acidjazz> ok my situation is im styling scrollbars
[21:17:03] <acidjazz> so i need to do custom widths based on if the browser supports stylized scrollbars
[21:17:05] <acidjazz> aka webkit or now
[21:17:07] <acidjazz> not*
[21:19:31] <acidjazz> navigator.userAgent.match(/webkit/i); ?
[21:34:26] <shoky> i suppose
[21:35:50] <shoky> modernizr does smth like this- https://gist.github.com/948808/fc3b13637c8aebc335bad726b32da51bae79c54a
[21:50:07] <dalnet22> is there a limit on how much data can be sent back in a $.get?
[21:50:36] <tw2113> computer memory limit is my guess
[21:51:12] <dalnet22> because when I echo back a small string I get a response, but when I echo back a larger one I get none
[21:51:44] <shoky> i think it depends on the browser
[21:52:17] <shoky> there's no limit in the http spec
[21:53:06] <shoky> well, and on the server too
[21:54:17] <dalnet22> hmm post doesn't return anything either, so something's up with this return string
[21:55:23] <shoky> oh, you mean in the response
[21:55:47] <shoky> no limit there..
[21:56:08] <dalnet22> yeah meant response
[21:56:36] <dalnet22> sweet there's a json validator lol
[21:59:46] <tw2113> jsonlint.com?
[22:03:36] <BlueShark> Hi, I'm trying to check if a input URL is 404 or not. Here's the code: http://jsbin.com/ayiveg/1/edit It doesn't output any errors but I don't know why it's not working. Could anyone help?
[22:06:09] <tw2113> i think $.ajax will be better for you
[22:06:59] <tw2113> gives you the statusCode callback option
[22:07:38] <tw2113> or the error callback
[22:07:45] <dalnet22> perhaps
[22:08:21] <BlueShark> tw2113: instead of getJSON?
[22:08:34] <tw2113> yes
[22:08:42] <tw2113> getJSON is just a wrapper for ajax anyway
[22:09:52] <BlueShark> $.ajax("proxy.php", {url: $(this).val()}, function(data){ — you mean like this?
[22:10:51] <tw2113> looks like a nice start
[22:13:21] <tw2113> check the ajax docs
[22:13:45] <BlueShark> tw2113: yeah, okay. I changed that part but still the error message doesn't get displayed.
[22:14:56] <BlueShark> I added a console.log inside the $.ajax but it didn't get outputted to the console. I think something's wrong with that part of the code.
[22:15:35] <tw2113> you typo'd ajax
[22:15:59] <tw2113> also what's proxy.php?
[22:16:08] <tw2113> you'll want an absolute url for that part in jsbin
[22:16:33] <tw2113> also read the docs on $.ajax, it has callbacks for error and whatnot
[22:16:46] <tw2113> none of this trying to match string in the data object
[22:17:41] <BlueShark> tw2113: http://codepad.org/tGWlCACV this is proxy.php (I'm trying to get the status code of a URL and then display it as <a href""> link)
[22:18:05] <tw2113> your relative url has no idea where proxy.php is on whatever server you're using
[22:18:05] <BlueShark> When I load http://foo.com/proxy.php?url=http://php.net it works as expected and produces the following output: {"header":"HTTP\/1.1 200 OK"}
[22:18:24] <BlueShark> I'm running this on localhost, so do I still need the absolute URL?
[22:18:46] <tw2113> not to run it locally
[22:19:03] <tw2113> if you want us to be able to see and help test with actual returned data, we'll need it on an accessable server
[22:24:25] <BlueShark> tw2113: http://techswipe.com/foo/
[22:26:03] <shoky> BlueShark: that's not how you use $.ajax
[22:29:08] <BlueShark> shoky: okay. I'm not really familiar with this. I'll check the docs. But what about $.getJSON? Would that work?
[22:29:11] <shoky> BlueShark:  $.ajax({url: "proxy.php", data: {url: $(this).val()}).done(function(data) { ... })
[22:29:16] <shoky> BlueShark: it should, yeah
[22:29:37] <tw2113> my logic was more stuff available in $.ajax, shoky
[22:29:48] <tw2113> unless you can pass in all the same params
[22:30:03] <shoky> tw2113 your logic was fine, he just didn't call it with the right arguments
[22:30:08] <BlueShark> right.
[22:30:17] <BlueShark> I updated the page. Could you please check now?
[22:30:17] <tw2113> just checking. making sure I'm going at the right approach
[22:30:31] <shoky> BlueShark: seems to work fine..
[22:30:58] <BlueShark> it doesn't return any output here.
[22:31:06] <shoky> BlueShark: i see "URL is Okay"
[22:31:23] <BlueShark> I don't.. Weird
[22:31:48] <BlueShark> oh yes. it's working!
[22:33:45] <shoky> you're getting a php warning for bad urls though, so it's not returning json
[22:35:39] <shoky> also that php is returning 200 OK for non-existent urls
[22:42:48] <BlueShark> shoky: yeah :/ How can I fix that?
[22:43:14] <shoky> BlueShark: that's a php question
[23:32:16] <lenswipee> hi, is there a break for jquery to get out of a .each loop?
[23:34:13] <lilbobbytables> return false
[23:37:33] <lenswipee> lilbobbytables: thanks
[23:38:35] <lenswipee> hi, what is the correct fucntion for adding a tag as first child given a selector? tried .after() and realised that was wrong
[23:40:23] <ravenzz> prepend ?
[23:41:41] <lenswipee> ravenzz: yeah i found that out. to prepend to existing first child. cheers
[23:42:14] <ravenzz> cool
[23:42:18] <lenswipee> ravenzz: you becomming a real pro at this buddy ;)
[23:44:29] <ravenzz> lenswipee hehe that's basic stuff described in the docs
[23:44:38] <lenswipee> lol
[23:44:56] <ravenzz> it is nothing pro at all :P
[23:45:07] <lenswipee> me still noob :D
[23:45:07] <newcandy> Hi there. I'm using a 3rd party image-browser on my website (Imperavi redactor), and I'm not familiar with js/jquery. I'm having a problem with the browser not recognizing that my json file has changed/images have been removed. Is this something I could fix in jquery?
[23:45:49] <ravenzz> ?demo @ newcandy
[23:45:49] <bot-t> newcandy, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or if you cannot do that, provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[23:45:54] <b-ot> newcandy: Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[23:46:29] <lenswipee> ravenzz: you master of the bot too. lol
[23:48:43] <newcandy> Neither is possible. The third party app is licensed, and the problem is within authorized pages on a production site. It's basically a jquery wysiwyg editor for textareas called Redactor, which has an image upload/image browse button. The upload, and creation/handling of the json-file is done in php. The issue seems to be that the browser cache doesnt update the imagelist, even if the json-file
[23:48:43] <newcandy> is empty. If I add an image, it will add it to the list tho. So I partly believe it to be a jquery thing
[23:50:08] <dalnet22> but my teachers told me that anything is possible
[23:50:37] <ravenzz> newcandy join #css-lance and hire a freelancer to do the job then
[23:50:57] <ravenzz> I can't debug your words :p
[23:51:30] <newcandy> Yeah I'm aware it's a bit silly to come here and ask for magic answers. Just sort of hoped this was a common issue with a simple fix :) I'll read up on the js source :)
