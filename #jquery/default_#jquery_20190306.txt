[05:01:45] <emx> I do a cross domain request. The OPTIONS request is responded with HTTP code 200 and after that the expected GET request is made. The response of the GET method is also HTTP code 200 and I see the expected payload but the error handler is triggered, not the success handler. the xhr.status is 0. What am I doing wrong?
[05:09:11] <xkr47> emx, I don't remember how it all exactly works, but you might be interested in looking at the "Access-Control-Allow-Origin" response header
[05:09:27] <xkr47> and maybe Access-Control-Allow-Headers too if you use some custom headers
[05:35:28] <emx> xkr47, I took care of that part...
[05:42:27] <shoky_> emx: show us one or more of:  your relevant client and server code, the request and response headers for both requests
[05:44:21] <shoky_> emx: and: do you see any CORS errors in the console? what browser?
[05:45:47] <shoky_> if not chrome, try with chrome and look for the error in the console. other browsers are less friendly with pointing out CORS errors
[07:07:03] <tneva82> is there any plugin that would have wheel that you can rotate which would then give time in HOUR:MIN format?
[07:07:24] <tneva82> Like easypark application in android hass
[07:53:12] <discopatrick> Hi all. I put together this solution for finding elements with a selector, but filtering out any nested elements, so you only get top level ones. http://jsfiddle.net/discopatrick/3egouLf8/8/
[07:53:12] <discopatrick> ...any suggestions for something more succinct that this?
[10:04:06] <AdamPDotty> discopatrick: You want .children() ?
[10:05:17] * AdamPDotty always answers practically instantly
[10:28:37] <discopatrick> AdamPDotty: the elements might not be direct children - otherwise that would have been a good idea, thank you
