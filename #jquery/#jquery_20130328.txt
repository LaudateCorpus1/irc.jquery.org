[00:00:33] <bsdbofh> i'll just need to get it organized enough to be uploaded
[00:06:13] <zChris> Hello, is there away to target an <input type="text" name="test[]"> ? I tried $('input[name=test\[\]]') but that didnt work.
[00:06:33] <Cork> $('input[name="test[]"]')
[00:06:49] <rideh> bsdbofh: bookmarked, great
[00:08:30] <zChris> Cork, thanks!
[00:15:09] <defaultro> hey guys, my officemate used Yslow. Is it helpful in optimizing a site?
[00:16:46] <zChris> What's the best way to go parent->parent->get child with name=xx ? Atm i have $(this).parent().parent() and trying to figure out the child command
[00:26:27] <djQuery> defaultro, well what did it say
[00:27:39] <djQuery> zChris, $(this).closest('.parentslector').find('.selector');
[00:28:05] <djQuery> zChris, or  $(this).parents('.parentslector').find('.selector');
[00:29:12] <defaultro> djQuery, it just suggested things on what can be improved
[00:29:14] <djQuery> zChris, or of u  know it is a real child  $(this).parents('.parentslector').children('.selector');
[00:29:33] <djQuery> defaultro, do they look reasonable?
[00:29:48] <defaultro> i'll have to recheck it
[00:29:55] <defaultro> maybe the joining of js files into one is
[00:30:19] <djQuery> defaultro, that realy depends on your pages in my opinion
[00:30:24] <defaultro> k
[00:30:29] <troop> hi g. morning
[00:30:45] <defaultro> btw, off topic question. Are you familiar what a page impression is?
[00:30:49] <djQuery> defaultro, if you have 2 pages that need 5 js   but most only need 2 how reasonable is it to combine them
[00:31:13] <defaultro> k
[00:31:30] <defaultro> i think all the js files are only called in our main layout index file
[00:31:35] <djQuery> defaultro, about the same as a hit
[00:31:46] <defaultro> got it
[00:31:57] <dingdong__> sadf:dfd
[00:32:10] <dingdong__> jqueryt
[00:32:40] <djQuery> defaultro, of acid
[00:32:57] <defaultro> ?
[00:33:18] <djQuery> sorry just came to mind
[00:33:30] <defaultro> what is it?
[00:33:47] <djQuery> defaultro, might get better use of your js files if you can move some of them to a cdn
[00:33:59] <djQuery> are you hosting jquery localy or cdn
[00:34:03] <defaultro> that's what I was thinking too
[00:34:10] <defaultro> all static files
[00:34:19] <defaultro> jpg. png, gif, mov and mp4
[00:49:36] <djQuery> `api migrate
[00:49:36] <b-ot> djQuery: No matches.
[00:49:43] <djQuery> `migrate
[00:49:43] <b-ot> djQuery: jquery-migrate: Migrate older jQuery code to jQuery 1.9+ - https://github.com/jquery/jquery-migrate/tree/1.0.0#download
[00:49:50] <djQuery> defaultro, ^^^^^
[00:54:00] <defaultro> cool
[00:55:00] <defaultro> Thank you so much for the help djQuery . I need to sleep now, it's 3am here :)
[00:55:38] <defaultro> that's the project I will do for our Innovation Week :)
[00:56:52] <defaultro> alright, taking off, goodnight/morning :)
[01:21:53] <anand__> can the same stuff in https://ide.madeiracloud.com/ ... can be build in jquery any views
[01:25:40] <anand__> hello is any one there
[01:33:40] <air_> anand__: the same stuff? are you referring to a login dialog?
[01:34:56] <daslicht> someone helped me yesterday with implementing this dialog:http://jsfiddle.net/daslicht/jNqRx/40/
[01:35:21] <daslicht> waht is this mkind of syntax : $doc.on('click.loginModal',
[01:35:26] <daslicht> 'click.loginModal'
[01:35:27] <daslicht> ??
[01:35:30] <Cork> namespace
[01:35:38] <daslicht> where does 'click.loginModal' come from ?
[01:35:50] <Cork> its what ever you want
[01:35:52] <daslicht> and loginModal?
[01:35:54] <Cork> its a namespace
[01:35:56] <Cork> yes
[01:36:05] <daslicht> please have a look at the fiddle
[01:36:07] <Cork> you can then do off('loginModal')
[01:36:17] <Cork> opps
[01:36:19] <daslicht> ahh ok its just defining ?
[01:36:21] <Cork> * off('.loginModal')
[01:36:24] <Cork> yes
[01:36:27] <daslicht> :)
[01:36:29] <daslicht> nice
[01:36:41] <Cork> it gives a namespace so you can grep only your event listeners
[01:38:00] <daslicht> what is going on at this part :
[01:38:03] <daslicht> $doc.on('click.loginModal', function(e) {
[01:38:03] <daslicht>                     var target = $(e.target);
[01:38:03] <daslicht>                     if ( !target.is(bubble) && target.closest(bubble).length < 1 ) {
[01:38:04] <daslicht>                         bubble.animate({opacity:0}, 250);
[01:38:06] <daslicht>                         $(this).off('click.loginModal');
[01:38:08] <daslicht>                     }
[01:38:10] <daslicht>                 });
[01:38:14] <daslicht> sorry for the few lines of pase :)
[01:38:16] <daslicht> paste
[01:39:07] <daslicht> looks like i a lacking of knowledge , whats this closest bubble length doing ?
[01:39:26] <Cork> a weird way of reimplementing delegation
[01:39:35] <Cork> not sure why he would do that
[01:39:41] <daslicht> this on handler is registeriung a handler  with the namespace click.loginmodal
[01:39:44] <daslicht> hehe
[01:39:58] <Cork> ah
[01:40:08] <Cork> no its the total opposite of delegate
[01:40:10] <daslicht> thats the logic to ckeck if the click is outside the bubble i guess
[01:40:29] <Cork> it goes the action as long as the original target wasn't inside the "bubble"
[01:40:39] <Cork> ya
[01:41:53] <daslicht> $doc.on('click.loginModal',  what is this ? a delegate without a target element to listen to ?
[01:42:18] <Cork> na, its just a normal event listener bound to doc
[01:43:05] <daslicht> i see
[01:43:26] <daslicht> and the .loginModal is just the namespace to be able to identify that specific lister
[01:43:32] <daslicht> so that he can off it later \
[01:43:33] <daslicht> ha
[01:43:49] <Cork> yes
[01:44:13] <daslicht> thank you !
[01:44:25] <Cork> np
[01:45:12] <daslicht> is it possible to improve the first animation ?
[01:45:22] <daslicht> i have noticed that it looks sometimes odd
[01:45:25] <daslicht> the first time
[01:47:59] <Cork> what first animation?
[01:51:36] <daslicht> when i klick the login link , i animate the login dialog from opacity 0 to 1
[01:51:56] <daslicht> the first time i do so , i see some stripes , and less smoth fade in
[01:52:11] <daslicht> if i clode the dialog and reopen it its smooth
[01:52:44] <Cork> could you make it go that way on the jsfiddle?
[01:53:53] <daslicht> nope
[01:54:15] <Cork> cause its prob from how the menu is hidden
[01:54:34] <Cork> and as its not hidden in the jsfiddle, i can't really tell what needs to be done
[01:55:15] <daslicht> http://jsfiddle.net/daslicht/jNqRx/43/
[01:55:18] <daslicht> now its hiddden
[01:55:29] <daslicht> i have just changed its initioan opacity to 0
[01:55:38] <Cork> is it hidden in the same way its hidden on your page?
[01:55:42] <daslicht> yes
[01:56:00] <daslicht> so it should be rendered no , or doesnt transparent items get rendered ?
[01:56:20] <daslicht> i try it with display none
[01:56:35] <Cork> display gives them no dimensions at all
[01:56:46] <Cork> images isn't rendered until they're visible
[01:58:52] <daslicht> ok i have no images
[01:58:53] <daslicht> hmm
[01:59:00] <daslicht> i play a lil bit
[01:59:20] <Cork> daslicht: well the menu in jsfiddle works, so it is something else
[01:59:41] <daslicht> i fade it in above other elements
[01:59:50] <daslicht> and i have positioned the box absolute
[02:00:04] <daslicht> maybe its teh source of this behaviour
[02:13:59] <CptCaptain> If I give a iframe a seamless attribute shouldn't .prop("seamless") return true? on jquery 1.9
[02:14:23] <Cork> no
[02:14:37] <CptCaptain> why not?
[02:14:38] <Cork> attr('seamless') should give you the attribute
[02:14:44] <Cork> prop is for properties
[02:15:33] <CptCaptain> I really have a hard time grasping the difference. I thought attributes was just the text/html and properties where just parsed attributes.
[02:15:43] <Cork> nope
[02:15:54] <Cork> properties is the member on the dom element
[02:16:00] <Cork> it changes as the state changes
[02:16:10] <Cork> or it is modified by the browser for what it needs
[02:16:20] <Cork> attributes is what was as an attribute on the html tag
[02:16:22] <Cork> it never changes
[02:16:46] <Cork> ex. <a href="file.html"> $('a').attr('href') == 'file.html'
[02:17:11] <Cork> $('a').prop('href') == 'http://example.com/path/to/file/file.html';
[02:17:54] <daslicht> i trued it with visibility :) but the first time it is fade in it still looks odd
[02:17:56] <Cork> basically attr is element.getAttribute('name'), while prop is element.name
[02:17:58] <daslicht> :/
[02:18:28] <Cork> daslicht: its prob cause a parent is doing something
[02:18:38] <daslicht> hm
[02:18:41] <Cork> check what css rules apply on the element and so on
[02:18:43] <daslicht> i google
[02:19:09] <Cork> you can't google what css rules you have in your page...
[02:20:29] <CptCaptain> so what's the difference between src and seamless on an iframe, I can both use attr and prop to change src
[02:20:59] <Cork> src is a defined property on an iframe element
[02:21:03] <systemfault> CptCaptain: Do you even know if your browser supports seamless iframes?
[02:21:07] <Cork> seamless isn't
[02:21:37] <systemfault> CptCaptain: If it did… then doing .prop('seamless', true) would probably work.
[02:21:54] <systemfault> seamless is bleeding edge.
[02:22:12] <CptCaptain> systemfault: aah...
[02:22:20] <Cork> as far as i know only chrome supports it
[02:22:27] <CptCaptain> that might be the reason
[02:22:28] <Cork> but it might be all of webkit
[02:23:06] <CptCaptain> No it's a WebControl in a winform application (sadly)
[02:23:29] <Cork> and what engine is it using?
[02:26:38] <systemfault> Probably trident :P
[02:26:56] <raj> hey Cork :)
[02:27:02] <Cork> ello
[02:27:13] <raj> remember when we talked about determining whether an element has overflow?
[02:27:17] <raj> specifically a div
[02:27:22] <Cork> ya
[02:27:31] <raj> and the issue was I didn't have the dimensions of the image
[02:27:36] <raj> I finally have the dimensions
[02:27:57] <Cork> nice
[02:29:27] <raj> so I have `$container.html("<img src='somefile.png'/>" + "<p>somefile.png</p>")` and I'm wondering what's the best way to apply the dimensions to the img so the nextline can be `var hasOverflow = $container.hasOverflow()`
[02:29:45] <raj> which is a boolean stating whether it's overflowing
[02:30:02] <raj> css? or within the img tag? or something else?
[02:30:46] <Cork> var img = $("<img src='somefile.png'/>"); $container.html(img.and("<p>somefile.png</p>")); img.height(height); img.width(width);
[02:30:53] <Cork> bah
[02:30:57] <Cork> var img = $("<img src='somefile.png'/>"); $container.html(img.add("<p>somefile.png</p>")); img.height(height); img.width(width);
[02:31:20] <raj> oh, cool :)
[02:31:21] <raj> thank you
[02:32:11] <yorrd_> I'm looking for a plugin that creates a slider somewhat like this: http://www.ef.de/lt/. Any ideas off the top of your minds?
[02:34:23] <Giusuppe> yyord_ http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/javascript.html#carousel
[02:35:13] <Giusuppe> yorrd_ http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/javascript.html#carousel
[02:37:45] <yorrd_> uhhhh, looks nice! Thanks for now :D
[02:40:53] <raj> Cork, it's telling me that overflow is false even though it's still true
[02:41:10] <raj> the <p> is clearly outside of the <div>
[02:41:15] <raj> div being the container
[02:42:47] <raj> does img have to be display block or osmething?
[02:42:49] <raj> it's currently inline
[02:44:07] <Cork> raj: could you generate an example?
[02:44:08] <raj> ok, that didn't make a difference
[02:44:19] <Cork> (warning i'll be leaving soon)
[02:44:21] <raj> k, i'll try, one sec
[02:45:39] <daslicht> may i ask a offtopic question ?
[02:46:30] <daslicht> i have this in my project:  <input class='input_a' type="password" name="pw" placeholder="Passwort"/> and the input background is yellowish, I havent found any css declartion for this color
[02:46:45] <daslicht> if I remove the name="pw" it gets white as ewxpected
[02:46:46] <daslicht> ?!
[02:46:56] <daslicht> I cant even override it with !important
[02:47:02] <daslicht> any idea whats going on ?
[02:47:05] <daslicht> please
[02:47:07] <Cork> search for input[name=pw]
[02:47:23] <daslicht> it also happens with anotehr input
[02:47:26] <Cork> daslicht: or even better inspect what css rules apply on the element
[02:47:30] <Cork> and check where they come from
[02:47:37] <daslicht> <input class='input_a' type="text" name="username" placeholder="Benutzername"/>
[02:47:52] <daslicht> i have other inputs but they are not affected
[02:47:52] <Cork> daslicht: inspect what css rules apply on the element
[02:47:54] <Cork> and check where they come from
[02:48:05] <daslicht> i have, using chrome dev tools
[02:48:10] <daslicht> but therer isnt any
[02:48:27] <Cork> sounds like your getting the validation coloring then
[02:48:33] <daslicht> i try to disable teh css imports one after each other
[02:48:36] <daslicht> ahh
[02:48:46] <Cork> either that or the focus ring thing
[02:48:47] <daslicht> so its js based
[02:48:53] <Cork> no
[02:49:05] <Cork> html form validation
[02:49:16] <daslicht> can i override this ?
[02:49:27] <Cork> you would have to check what causes it first
[02:49:51] <daslicht> you are right ! its only in chrome
[02:49:56] <Cork> daslicht: lets back up a bit, can you create a jsfiddle that shows the problem?
[02:50:02] <daslicht> in firewiorks its not colored
[02:50:12] <Cork> then it sounds like input field focus
[02:50:24] <Cork> firewiorks?
[02:50:28] <Cork> firefox?
[02:50:30] <daslicht> firefox
[02:50:32] <daslicht> sorry
[02:50:32] <Cork> :)
[02:50:41] <daslicht> i have fireworks open here :)
[02:50:46] <raj> Cork, well, this is sort of opposite problem--> http://jsfiddle.net/GSEP3/
[02:50:48] <raj> it always says overflowing
[02:52:43] <raj> here's a smaller image as well http://jsfiddle.net/GSEP3/1/
[02:53:07] <raj> god i'm retarded
[02:55:45] <daslicht> ahh it turning yellow if the browser rememberd teh username !
[02:56:01] <daslicht> and autofill it
[02:56:30] <Cork> raj: it is overflowing http://jsfiddle.net/GSEP3/6/
[02:56:56] <Cork> raj: content size: 166px, element size: 147px
[02:57:19] <Cork> raj: if you don't have overflow: hidden/auto/scroll the element won't crop at its border
[02:57:20] <raj> Cork, if I do overflow:hidden; on the container in my actual js, it hides the correct stuff
[02:57:41] <raj> but hasOverflow still thinks there's no overflow
[02:57:44] <Cork> raj: my point is, i don't see any error
[02:58:03] <raj> you're right
[02:58:05] <raj> this isn't error
[02:58:06] <raj> ing
[02:58:08] <raj> i'm not sure why
[02:58:52] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/GSEP3/7/
[02:59:03] <Cork> raj: your always alerting, you don't check the return value :)
[02:59:13] <raj> i know
[02:59:21] <raj> that's why i realized I was retarded =S
[02:59:27] <Cork> lol
[02:59:43] <raj> $('img').height() in my actual code is 42
[02:59:59] <raj> $('#container').height() is 132.61
[03:00:07] <raj> $('p').height() is 114
[03:00:19] <raj> so why is hasOverflow reporting false
[03:00:32] <daslicht> ok think i identified the source of this issue, if you have a form with usename input and password and chome remembers the credentials , it colors the background yellowis
[03:00:47] <Cork> what is $('#container').prop('scrollHeight') ?
[03:01:10] <raj> 139
[03:01:40] <Cork> and hasOverflow returns false?
[03:03:03] <raj> hmm, it doesn't after the page is loaded
[03:03:06] <raj> only during loading
[03:03:11] <raj> sorry, I should investigate further
[03:03:18] <raj> thanks for making me aware of that :)
[03:03:19] <Melichades> hi! does anyone know a working example of .animate with easing? my easing-functions always create js-errors
[03:03:55] <Anticom> hi all
[03:04:08] <Anticom> i just wondered, wether there is a shorthand to kind of reset form fields
[03:07:29] <daslicht> ->> http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=1334
[03:07:36] <daslicht> its a chrome BUG
[03:07:38] <Cork> melfy: ya, doens't wok for me either
[03:07:39] <daslicht> lol
[03:08:09] <Cork> daslicht: "We inherit this coloring behavior from WebKit and I believe it's by design. It allows
[03:08:09] <Cork> the user to understand the data has been prefilled."
[03:08:24] <Cork> its not a bug
[03:08:24] <daslicht> suoper
[03:08:31] <daslicht> than a bad feature
[03:08:39] <Cork> daslicht: can you reproduce it in a jsfiddle?
[03:08:40] <daslicht> at least we should have control of the color
[03:08:48] <daslicht> how can i save userdata to fiddle
[03:08:49] <daslicht> no
[03:08:57] <daslicht> its not working sice i cant submit a form on fiddle
[03:10:57] <daslicht> nice therer are workaround s:)
[03:11:43] <Cork> daslicht: try input:-webkit-autofill { color: white !important; }
[03:11:59] <lundy> hi folks, could someone have a quick look at http://spb-fb.co.uk/ and tell me if my login script is ok? i dunno if its safe or not :X

[03:12:13] <daslicht> not doing anyhthing here
[03:12:37] <Cork> hmm i'm quite sure i've fixed this on one of my sites
[03:12:42] <Cork> don't remember what i did though
[03:13:36] <Cork> have a nice easter!
[03:13:42] * Cork signs off
[03:14:17] <Trisox> oi o/
[03:14:59] <raj> Cork, all fixed
[03:15:21] <raj> it was a bunch of ridiculously silly mistakes
[03:15:27] <lundy> :/ anyone?
[03:16:13] <Kv`> hey, i have to create var number = 113 from an input name="cart[113][qty]"
[03:16:16] <Kv`> how can i do ?
[03:17:53] <j_wright> a regex ^cart\[(\d+)\] ?
[03:18:51] <j_wright> of course i am only guessing cart is fixed, you could try splitting by \[|\] and getting the second element
[03:19:23] <GoSox> yo]

[04:05:30] <ravenzz> yes
[04:08:29] <dobalina> ravenzz it's basically in a think like this
[04:08:35] <dobalina> *thing http://pastebin.mozilla.org/2253408
[04:08:50] <dobalina> and it's really just the last <article class="mw960p center mb3 pb3" role="article" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" itemscope=""> i want to load
[04:09:11] <dobalina> but i can't seem to isolate that through the load() directly
[04:09:34] <dobalina> not sure why ... i tried the #content .mw960p but it doesn't work... it still loads the whole #content
[04:09:37] <dobalina> and thie crap above it
[04:11:34] <Melichades> @dobalina: you want to fill another element, NOT $(this) ?
[04:12:05] <Gorkyman> so if I get this right... jQuery mobile still needs jquery core as a base?
[04:12:47] <dobalina> Melichades hmmm maybe?  bascially i want to load only a specific element from a url on the same domain into another div or something
[04:12:53] <dobalina> on the same page without the page refreshing
[04:13:11] <dobalina> and it's the article.mw960p part i want to load() from the url i'm calling
[04:14:12] <Melichades> so use .post or .get
[04:14:12] <Melichades> $.post( FROMWHERE, ARGS, function(theRESULT) { $(yourtargetelement).html(theRESULT) }
[04:15:03] <Melichades> this places the result in your Element
[04:17:31] <dobalina> get the contents of a url on the same domain huh?  so it basically does the same thing as load?
[04:37:47] <smftre> anyone?
[04:37:51] <raj> can I use .on() anywhere .bind() is accepted?
[04:37:53] <ravenzz> raj yes
[04:37:53] <ravenzz> smftre try #javascript
[04:37:54] <raj> thanks ravenzz
[04:41:43] <smftre> ravenzz: I asked in here because I still want jQuery, just want to know what others are using?
[04:42:00] <smftre> How do you organise your js files and call in templates?
[04:44:57] <Logikos> smftre: you didnt ask a specific question that can be answered directly... you asked for general thoughts on a given topic, for that its best to read articles online.  just do a google search and start reading
[04:45:30] <smftre> fair enough
[04:47:06] <juha_> smftre: require.js is your friend in organizing files and underscore.js is your friend with templates. underscore is a requirement for backbone, so you should use it to the fullest
[04:48:11] <smftre> so it sounds like I am on the right path
[04:49:36] <hrr> does anybody know a nice well documented and simple wizard? for multi-steps forms?
[04:54:57] <Anticom> hrr i don't recommend js based wizzards
[04:55:13] <Anticom> if someone has disabled js the wizzard fails completly and everything looks messy
[04:55:14] <hrr> Anticom: how come?
[04:55:22] <Anticom> i would implement a server-side wizzard
[04:56:40] <hrr> Anticom: i think i'll do that but i want a nice transition effects. what would u recommend?
[05:06:49] <Anticom> sorry hrr, had to do sth else
[05:07:35] <Anticom> um, i found steppy is one of the best looking ones ( http://wbotelhos.com/stepy ) but jq Form Wizzard ( http://thecodemine.org/# ) is nice too and it's well documented, which is one of your requirements
[05:08:44] <Anticom> oh and steppy looks okay if js is disabled, since it's using fieldsets
[05:09:50] <dzigi> umm, is this the place to ask about debuging or is that question better suited for jquery-dev channel?
[05:14:37] <RSDRSDRSD> are there some better tutorials on writng solid plugins
[05:15:07] <RSDRSDRSD> the ones  on jquery.com are not that clear

[05:36:49] <Meppapza> Hey allemaal
[05:36:51] <jmr_> tuurlijkkkk rsdrsd
[05:37:08] <Meppapza> Heeft iemand iets gehoord over problemen met Firefox en Jquery?
[05:37:08] <jmr_> klapjes vanavond in BV
[05:37:43] <Meppapza> Ik krijg de nieuwste versie niet werkend
[05:37:54] <rsdrsd> nee wel over dat cyberbunker.com het internet lam legt
[05:38:09] <jmr_> Gehoord van wie ?
[05:38:20] <rsdrsd> ingeving
[05:38:28] <jmr_> jou rackje staat daar ook toch
[05:38:36] <rsdrsd> was maar waar
[05:38:55] <Meppapza> Haha wordt hier uberhaupt gepraat over Jquery?
[05:38:59] <rsdrsd> dan hoefde ik me niet druk te maken om atoom aanvallen
[05:39:02] <Meppapza> Lang leve IRC haha
[05:39:17] <jmr_> lekker zwemmen en jqueryen in de bunker
[05:39:21] <rsdrsd> ok, back to business
[05:39:30] <jmr_> yes please
[05:39:38] <rsdrsd> let me check
[05:39:49] <rsdrsd> which ff version do u use?
[05:40:03] <Meppapza> 19.0.2
[05:40:11] <spobat> hey
[05:40:13] <Meppapza> With the most recent Jquery and Jquery  UI
[05:40:27] <spobat> I put this in my window.resize function: http://ideone.com/zaw8LW
[05:40:50] <spobat> but the issue is that the body (#chat, #channel-attendees) grows infinitely heigh as I resize the window
[05:40:59] <spobat> I'm doing something wrong, obviously, but I can't spot the error on that
[05:41:34] <Meppapza> All other browsers work, Javascript seems to work since the alert() functions does its job.
[05:41:48] <jmr_> rsdrsd will solve your issue
[05:41:59] <Meppapza> The website is dev.biesaart.net
[05:42:35] <rsdrsd> no problems here
[05:42:38] <rsdrsd> need to login?
[05:43:02] <Meppapza> Invalid credetials should shake the window
[05:43:12] <rsdrsd> TypeError: supportElem.style is undefined
[05:43:12] <rsdrsd> [Afbreken op deze fout] 	
[05:43:12] <rsdrsd> supportElem.style.cssText = "background-color:rgba(1,1,1,.5)";
[05:43:23] <Meppapza> Yes, that's the error
[05:43:55] <Meppapza> It comes from Jquery ui
[05:44:21] <rsdrsd> maybe send a bug report to the dev team of ui
[05:44:31] <Meppapza> Ok, ill try
[05:44:43] <Meppapza> I might try with a different version of Jquery
[05:45:04] <Meppapza> But that doesn't fix it all. I tried to run this: $(document).ready(function() { 	alert("TEST"); });
[05:45:10] <Meppapza> But even that didn't work
[05:45:27] <Meppapza> If you reload that's the script that will run
[05:45:32] <Meppapza> it is the login.js
[05:46:21] <rsdrsd> if you remove that one?
[05:47:36] <Meppapza> I removed jquery ui and loaded the login.js which only has the code: $(document).ready(function() { 	alert("TEST"); });
[05:47:55] <Meppapza> It should pop up saying TEST
[05:47:58] <Meppapza> But it doesn't
[05:49:44] <fanderzzon> Hi, i'm using Bootstrap and tooltip function, how do I use jQuery when i click it open content that I've specified?

[06:15:55] <seba4> hi there one question if i got a string and i want to replace many variables with some text ... how could i do it there is a chance  with .replace(...).replace()....  like this for any word. Is it possible to shorten?
[06:17:53] <spobat> how can I capture a thing that is NOT enclosed by ` - symbol?
[06:17:58] <spobat> this is *captured* but `this *is* not `.
[06:18:03] <spobat> to capture the *text here* I have got: \*([^\*]+?)\*
[06:18:08] <spobat> the "*is*" is not captured, because it is within ` `
[06:18:14] <spobat> How can I do that?

[06:35:44] <omani_> does anybody know how flocharts work? I have my labels and data, but I can't draw lines
[06:35:53] <omani_> I think my data is in wrong format

[06:37:46] <omani_> nopaste.

[06:51:13] <sirionnn> Well that's fun.
[06:51:36] <sirionnn> I have a div#Boundingbox that I want to reveal after a delay
[06:51:38] <sirionnn> $('#Boundingbox').delay(300).show(1000);
[06:51:40] <sirionnn> works just fine
[06:51:54] <sirionnn> $('#Boundingbox').delay(400).show(1000); never reveals the box
[06:52:23] <sirionnn> Riddle me *that*. :P
[06:59:22] <sirionnn> Fixed it with nonsense. $('#Boundingbox').delay(1000).show(1000); doesn't work, but $('#Boundingbox').hide(1000).delay(1000).show(1000); works just fine
[07:00:40] <MrTool> sirionnn: did you try it with the animation queue function?
[07:01:14] <sirionnn> no. Looking up what that is now; I started jQuery like an hour ago :P
[07:02:00] <MrTool> maybe this could help: http://cdmckay.org/blog/2010/06/22/how-to-use-custom-jquery-animation-queues/
[07:05:15] <b-lew> anyone up for helping out with an extensive js problem I'm having that involves wordpress?
[07:06:46] <is_null> hi all, when jquery does clone(true) on an element which has an object in it's data, is there any way to hook on that to modify the cloned object ?
[07:07:41] <sirionnn> that'd be thx, mrtool
[07:07:49] <sirionnn> er, thanks, mrtool
[07:08:54] <is_null> i made a plugin, which should be usable by another plugin ... but the other plugin dumbly clones my stuff
[07:11:29] <amph1bius> b-lew: whats the problem
[07:11:48] <Mottie> is_null: just assign a variable.... var clone = $('.selector').clone();
[07:12:33] <Mottie> is_null: and don't forget you can clone the events as well .clone(true)
[07:12:48] <b-lew> Well I'm using a shortcode in some javascript and its conflicting with a small jquery plugin called superbox. https://github.com/toddmotto/superbox
[07:12:57] <b-lew> Royal Slider - ever heard of it?
[07:13:15] <b-lew> http://codecanyon.net/item/royalslider-touchenabled-jquery-image-gallery/461126
[07:14:06] <b-lew> anyways, I had to do a few tweaks to the superbox plugin and customize it to work with titles and descriptions of a custom post type also so it would work with quicksand.
[07:14:36] <hateIE> hey I am having trouble with zurbs orbit which was or is a jquery plugin so any way I have my nav bar which is nine columns and the orbit plugin which has to be twelve columns and it still cant mate up to my nav bar.. I cant get the orbit to use nine columns with out it scaling the orbit images smaller its kind of whacky am I doing some wrong here ?
[07:14:59] <ph88> i read the manual about val()    why doesn't this work ?  http://jsfiddle.net/Gu93k/1/
[07:15:08] <b-lew> I think the sandbox is conflicting though I'm not getting any errors
[07:15:11] <hateIE> i tested it and if you do a new row and nine coloumns twice in a row it creates identical rows and columns
[07:16:07] <amph1bius> i have heard about it, but can't you just change the shortcode ?
[07:16:30] <b-lew> basically i'm trying to state if you have a gallery show it else show a static image. http://pastie.org/7150575
[07:16:48] <djQuery> hateIE, because a select is different than other items
[07:16:51] <b-lew> I'm pretty confused right now though as to why its not working.
[07:18:38] <sirionnn> What should I be googling if I want to attach a <div> to the right side of the browser window and have it float in front of everything? "float" doesn't seem to be what I'm after...
[07:19:09] <djQuery> hateIE, wierd it is working in chrome just not displaying that it is till I click on the select
[07:19:30] <Mottie> sirionnn: use css... position: absolute; right: 0; top:0; z-index: 99999;
[07:20:10] <Mottie> sirionnn: or do you mean position:fixed;... so it will stick while the page scrolls
[07:20:53] <sirionnn> Fixed. Thanks
[07:21:39] <amph1bius> hopefully someone else can help you out here, i thought it was a simple question
[07:22:05] <b-lew> question might be a bit too much for IRC
[07:22:29] <yorrd> $('.carousel').carousel(target);   Anyone who knows bootstrap wanna tell me what's wrong with this (target being a number between 0 & 2)?
[07:23:01] <yorrd> gives me this: Uncaught TypeError: Property '2' of object #<Object> is not a function
[07:23:10] <yorrd> Just putting in a number works.
[07:23:30] <djQuery> hateIE, this has the same behavior
[07:23:40] <djQuery> I don't do im hateie
[07:24:02] <ph88> <select id="test" multiple></select>    how do i load values in here ?   tried   $('#test').val(["A", "B", "C"]);
[07:24:08] <hateIE> k
[07:24:19] <hateIE> i'll smash it with my hammer then
[07:24:27] <Mottie> ph88: use .html() or .append()
[07:24:43] <Mottie> oh wait
[07:25:03] <Mottie> you'll need to wrap those values in an <option></option> first
[07:25:04] <djQuery> ph88, you are trying to add new options to a select?
[07:25:09] <ph88> yes
[07:26:22] <djQuery> $('#test').append('<option value="A">A</option><option value="B">B</option>');
[07:26:54] <ph88> thx djQuery
[07:27:20] <djQuery> ph88, append won't overwrite the existing options though
[07:27:38] <ph88> of course i need to load that from an array, but i was confused as i thought i could do it with val()
[07:27:51] <ph88> oh i need fresh options
[07:28:05] <amaroks1> ph88: then use .html() instead of append()
[07:28:09] <ph88> oki
[07:28:21] <fabioportieri> guys i'm using the php yii framework.. (which uses jquery) problem is i have an ajax call that doesn't work on ff (i can inspect the response page with firebug and it's ok, but the actual page in the browser isn't refreshed, no error whatsoever) but working fine on other browsers.. i discovered that putting a <script> for loading a hosted version of jquery make the ajax call work on ff too, too bad it breaks all the yii-js relate
[07:28:45] <ph88> .html()   removes all options ?
[07:29:26] <ph88> oh maybe better empty()
[07:29:35] <djQuery> ph88, no .html('') would remove all options
[07:29:52] <djQuery> ph88, would just get them
[07:30:47] <hateIE> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11702021/width-of-orbit-slider <-- arrgh i willl smite them ;=<
[07:31:07] <fabioportieri> hateIE: hi my name is hateFF
[07:31:35] <hateIE> ok
[07:31:55] <deepy> Don't you mean Fx?
[07:32:32] <djQuery> fabioportieri, well it sounds like the version if jquery that ships whith php yii has a bug in ff
[07:32:41] <djQuery> what version is it shipping with?
[07:33:13] <fabioportieri> djQuery: 1.8.3, but the online hosted version that solve the bug is 1.8.3 too
[07:34:09] <computer2000> anyone can recommend me a lightweight and easy to use session-/localstorage lib? is store.js still cool? hasnt been updated for 2 yrs now

[07:35:00] <hateIE> hate nicks are limited to thing that can be abvreviated too two letters hehe
[07:37:05] <djQuery> hateIE, you could always do hate-hateIE
[07:47:56] <Assimilater> Anyone familiar with the treeview plugin? I'm trying to figure out how to work with it to a) on load make sure the selected (blue) node's parent is open and b) when a folder's span is clicked and it's not selected select it and DON'T toggle the display (open or closed) but if it's clicked when selected go ahead and toggle it.

I'm trying to figure out how to work with it to a) on load make sure the selected (blue) node's parent is open and b) when a folder's span is clicked and it's not selected select it and DON'T toggle the display (open or closed) but if it's clicked when selected go ahead and toggle it. Here's a fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/Assimilater/DDzNn/2/
[08:00:28] <hateIE> Assimilater you want the node to basically go blue when ever they clicked it
[08:00:46] <mitzev_> anyone familar with Sly scroller plugin?
[08:01:19] <hateIE> so the root node goes blue and it folows them around in the tree
[08:02:02] <djQuery> Assimilater, so 1st click select 2nd click expand?
[08:02:13] <Assimilater> djQuery: yes, or contract
[08:02:35] <Assimilater> hateIE: the blue is an indicator of what is open in an ajax viewing window
[08:02:46] <Assimilater> hateIE: there's going to be folder management and file management that's loadable
[08:02:49] <Trudko> guys any good artciel about what basic concepts does jquery use under the hood? I would like to create my own simple library to learn js a bit more.
[08:03:51] <Mottie> Trudko: check out http://paulirish.com/2010/10-things-i-learned-from-the-jquery-source/
[08:03:56] <Assimilater> djQuery: and actually more accurately if it's contracted on select it should expand, just not contract on the first click
[08:04:05] <is_null> hi all, how to see all binds of an element ?
[08:05:00] <mitzev_> SLY plugin
[08:05:02] <mitzev_> anyt one use it?
[08:05:18] <hateIE> mitzev_ nope but im have some slider problems my self
[08:05:29] <mitzev_> theres a problem for me, the prevPage button doesnt work when reached the end of a slidee
[08:05:56] <hateIE> got a link/fiddle
[08:06:27] <djQuery> Assimilater, doesn't look like you can
[08:06:42] <mitzev_> fiddle me this, fiddle me that
[08:06:49] <djQuery> Assimilater, there don't seem to be any call backs to the click events
[08:07:05] <mitzev_> to fiddle or not fiddle, that is the question.
[08:07:10] <hateIE> i know theres allot of fiddling going on jsfiddle.net
[08:07:17] <djQuery> mitzev_, jsbin
[08:07:25] <djQuery> .com
[08:07:45] <mitzev_> lawl
[08:07:53] <Assimilater> djQuery: I've been considering modifying a copy of treeview to add expand and collapse functions
[08:08:11] <Mottie> is_null: try this... $._data( $('.selector')[0] ).events
[08:08:25] <Assimilater> djQuery: though i've never worked with jQuery extenion usages before, it's taking a bit to get used to what I'm seeing :P
[08:08:35] <is_null> Mottie: thanks
[08:09:37] <hateIE> i might have ditch orbit slider .. the sky has fallen ;<
[08:09:53] <Trudko> Mottie: i did remember that article, is it still relevant? its pretty old now
[08:09:57] <djQuery> is_null, still might not get anything bound with .on
[08:10:24] <djQuery> $('.parent').on('click', '.child', function(){});
[08:10:26] <Mottie> Trudko: it's relevant to learning
[08:10:39] <djQuery> is_null, as the click is actualy bound to the parent
[08:16:04] <pats_Toms> someone know any alternative to something like this? https://github.com/srobbin/jquery-pageslide
[08:17:22] <jonez> do I need to do anything special if I have more than one call to $(document).ready() on the same page?
[08:18:21] <tw2113> multiple calls to ready() should be just fine
[08:20:19] <jonez> tw2113, ok
[08:20:44] <tw2113> it won't set off an atom bomb, i know that much
[08:20:46] <jonez> I noticed that my code is not getting called anymore. I added a console.log("foo"), but I do not see any output anywhere
[08:20:57] <jonez> I googled and came to the same conclusion, tw2113 :)
[08:23:28] <darkfrog> is there any way in jQuery to append SVG as a string like you can do with HTML: $('parent').append(tagString); ?
[08:23:33] <Assimilater> djQuery: http://jsfiddle.net/Assimilater/DDzNn/3/ this one has links to css and image fixes I made and you can see where where I tried to add in expand and collapse functions but I'm not sure how to proceed from here. It doesn't seem like he determines anywhere the state of a node as being open or closed, just toggles it. But I haven't looked at this *too* long yet
[08:24:18] <darkfrog> there are some examples on stackoverflow but they require you to have the SVG parsed into attributes to build it via JavaScript.
[08:24:23] <agu10^> What deployment tool do you suggest to get my website from windows 8 into my VPS server on ubuntu server?
[08:26:26] <samu> Anybody knows caroufredsel?
[08:28:21] <bluesm> Is jquery support something that could provide me easy way to "get template from ajax " ?
[08:28:26] <bluesm> And insert it ?
[08:30:53] <Assimilater> bluesm: what do you mean "get template". As for ajax and inserting it have you looked at html()?
[08:31:12] <Assimilater> bluesm: sorry i mean load()
[08:32:27] <bluesm> Assimilater: I just want to get data from server. But I think that is stupid to "get JSON data" then interpret it and insert it.
[08:33:39] <shadyKhan> when hovering over an element to make another element show. how can i make it so that when i hover over the newly shown element that it doesnt fade away? and i cant use is(:hover) because im forced using an old jquery version
[08:33:50] <Assimilater> bluesm: I think this is what you're looking for: http://api.jquery.com/load/
[08:34:10] <bluesm> Assimilater:  I see. Thank you very much :)
[08:42:42] <rideh> what is proper way to do line # 4 ?  http://dpaste.com/1037756/
[08:43:02] <rideh> i tried getAttribute() but it wasnt working
[08:45:14] <rideh> nvm i'm an idiot
[08:49:06] <anew> anyone using .validate here
[08:50:29] <jonez> what are the conditions that the "datacomplete" callback in the $.getJSON() call fails to execute the callback? I have an alert() as the first line of a callback and it never gets called
[08:50:56] <jonez> er... maybe not a callback.. it's an "anonymous function"
[08:56:38] <milovan> hi, any tips or help progrmas / whatever for migrating js code from jquery 1.3.2 to 1.5.2
[08:56:57] <milovan> because with 1.5.2 a lot of things do not work probably by huge changes
[08:57:05] <hlve> stop using such old versions of jquery.
[08:57:06] <hlve> lol
[08:57:23] <hlve> upgrading to 1.9.1. you're going to have a bad time.
[08:57:26] <milovan> drupal 6 cant use higher than 1.5.2 so...
[08:57:43] <pachet> poopal
[08:57:43] <hlve> http://drupal.org/node/757336
[08:57:46] <hlve> what are you talking about?
[08:57:46] <hlve> lol
[08:58:15] <milovan> yeah its easy just to google the link, but tr use a lot of contributed modules with 1.9
[08:58:19] <milovan> try*
[08:58:33] <hateIE> hm mitzev_ sly slide == pro
[08:58:37] <Mottie> hlve: that's for jQuery UI
[08:58:42] <milovan> most of them are written for 1.2.6 (core) or 1.3.2 (jquery_update)
[08:58:54] <milovan> and by the way thats jquery ui
[08:58:56] <hlve> http://drupal.org/node/1058168 ?
[08:59:13] <hlve> not sure what was depricated in 1.5.2
[08:59:44] <milovan> read that link too.. Tested 2 weeks complete site and 1.5.2 only works ok (witch patching core even)
[09:00:20] <milovan> so because contributed modules work, i need now custom modules to port to 1.5.2 too because they were built for 1.3.2 and now they dont work
[09:00:37] <milovan> so all i m asking for tips or any kind of aid program to port it easier
[09:00:56] <pachet> if you do find some kind of aid program, let me know
[09:01:00] <pachet> only because i'd find it very amusing
[09:01:05] <pachet> that such a thing would exist
[09:01:08] <milovan> i found some jquery migrate plugin on jquery.com but its for 1.9.x only?
[09:01:32] <ezakimak> is there an advantage to using jquery-ui-bootstrap?
[09:03:36] <hateIE> hrm no sly slider fails .. its nots responsively scaling the images
[09:04:01] <milovan> pachet: i found these: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-migrate/#readme and https://github.com/jquery/jquery-compat-1.3/blob/master/jquery.compat-1.3.js
[09:04:29] <milovan> but thought i d get some better ideas and info on #jquery :)
[09:08:50] <khmer_> ok quick poll
[09:09:46] <khmer_> if i have written a JS SDK that takes JSON-HAL objects and turns them into rich JS objects, with linking methods and whatnot, and those linking methods implement Promises/A+ so they're all thenable, then do i also need to add any pub/sub to these objects?
[09:10:33] <jonez> greetings. in this code: http://pastebin.com/gtZsSEtW the alert() call never gets run. I know getJSON() is being called because I am watching logs. any pointers?
[09:15:01] <jonez> khmer_, I'm afraid you've used too many terms I'm not familiar with to know how to vote in your poll
[09:15:26] <khmer_> jonez: i accept your answer :)
[09:15:41] <jonez> khmer_, :)
[09:15:54] <hateIE> hm sly slider just gave me a headake ;[
[09:16:30] <mitzev_> hateIE, ??
[09:16:51] <hateIE> its not very "responsive" friendly
[09:17:08] <jonez> the trouble in my code is that the alert() call never happens. I know jquery is the same version. did I do the anonymous functions wrong?
[09:17:11] <mitzev_> it doesnt mention anything about being responsive friendly
[09:17:13] <mitzev_> in the docs :(
[09:17:46] <hateIE> mitzev looka at http://www.good-hope-and-rated.co.uk/
[09:18:17] <khmer_> jonez: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/5264552 if you're curious
[09:18:24] <hateIE> if you set the image in sly slider to height:100% and width:80%
[09:18:55] <jonez> khmer_, so what does "pub/sub" mean?
[09:19:16] <jonez> khmer_, and regardless of what it means, will this api work for what *you* intend to use it for?
[09:19:17] <hateIE> which gets the images kinda scaled, i mean its not that bad but if you try and resize it it goes out of view
[09:19:58] <hateIE> but orbit is awesome it resizes and scales very elegantly
[09:34:03] <anew> .serializeObject();
[09:34:07] <anew> anyone knwo what this is
[09:39:43] <Koganei> anew: maybe a deprecated version of .serializeForm()?
[09:40:00] <anew> hmm it's in a new release of this plugin
[09:40:11] <anew> is serializeForm standard jq ?
[09:40:14] <anew> or is it also a plugin
[09:40:33] <Koganei> sorry I meant serialize()
[09:40:49] <Koganei> it's standard
[09:42:06] <rakl> How can I call $('.parent').find('.children') and exclude certain indexes in the list of children?
[09:42:23] <rakl> $('ul').find('li')
[09:43:33] <pachet> ?.slice() @ rakl
[09:43:34] <bot-t> rakl, .slice(start, [end]): Reduce the set of matched elements to a subset specified by a range of indices. http://api.jquery.com/slice/

[09:45:38] <shadyKhan> is there a way to determine when a new element gets added to the dom>
[09:46:00] <bil> when doing event delegation through on(), can I use a jquery object as the selector parameter?
[09:46:16] <pachet> bil: what's the point of doing delegation in that case
[09:46:49] <pachet> ?g mdn MutationObserver @ shadyKahn
[09:46:49] <b-ot> shadyKahn: Sorry, no results for ‟mdn MutationObserver @ shadyKahn”.
[09:46:52] <bot-t> shadyKahn, MutationObserver - Document Object Model (DOM) | MDN - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/MutationObserver
[09:46:52] <bil> to minimize bindings
[09:47:04] <pachet> er, shadyKhan rather
[09:47:09] <bil> the jquery object is already cached
[09:51:48] <pachet> bil: just throw `if ( ! $cachedSet.is(this) ) { return }` in your handler :[
[09:55:37] <djQuery> shadyKhan, see ?newcontent
[09:55:39] <bot-t> shadyKhan, jQuery.newContent is a plugin that helps maintain a set of callbacks for elements as they are added. Bind a callback with $( selector ).newContent( function ) and execute the bound callbacks by calling .newContent() on any new content you are adding to the DOM - https://gist.github.com/1003630
[09:56:26] <sirionnn> I should be able to get jquery working by adding <script type="text/javascript" src="jquery/jquery-1.9.1.min.js"></script> to the header, no?
[09:57:12] <rakl> pachet filter was what I was looking for thans
[09:57:17] <rakl> thanks*
[09:57:27] <pachet> sirionnn: assuming the script actually exists at that location
[10:00:46] <sirionnn> Hmm...
[10:01:17] <sirionnn> It seems like it does load, but it destroys the rest of the javascript running on the site and it doesn't actually *work*
[10:04:27] <hateIE> aha i worked out my problem slight case of pebkac
[10:07:59] <hateIE> the actual size of the images are obviously going to be slightly bigger then the calculated percentage until you reach really small screens
[10:10:04] <Croves> Hey guys! Is there a way to use .toggle(), but with the slideDown()/slideUp effect?
[10:12:00] <Croves> Ok, I guess .slideToggle() is the function that I'm looking for :P
[10:12:01] <Croves> Sorry!
[10:12:03] <Croves> And thanks
[10:12:26] <tomasm-> hi, is the load() function on an image supposed to be triggered when the image loads with the page? this is when 'src' is set in the html, not when it's changed. or does it only trigger when src is changed?
[10:13:18] <pachet> tomasm-: it triggers when the image is loaded
[10:13:34] <pachet> this can be because its the first time you load that page and pull the image down, or because you explicitly change the src
[10:14:11] <pachet> if the image is in cache it's heads or tails whether you'll be able to attach a handler before that event fires
[10:18:05] <troop> hello
[10:19:06] <troop> i can send  data via post to page again after the selection with ajax? source doesnt seem in page?
[10:19:20] <tomasm-> d'oh, it wasnt triggering because the dom element didnt exist yet.
[10:19:52] <troop> how will i fix it?
[10:19:53] <BabySuperman> How do I "capture" a form submission, and instead of doing the redirect, load that "redirected" page into a div?
[10:20:18] <tomasm-> BabySuperman, jquery form plugin
[10:20:29] <BabySuperman> tomasm-, k googling
[10:20:35] <BabySuperman> id pref not to use a plugin
[10:20:37] <jmr_> brrrr
[10:21:18] <troop> how will i fix my problem?
[10:22:03] <BabySuperman> tomasm-, oh, dont need that at all... just the regular ajax function works fine for me!
[10:23:43] <djQuery> shadyKhan, http://help.dottoro.com/ljmcxjla.php
[10:24:32] <tomasm-> babysuperman, I would reconsider. it's very useful and you'll use it forever. it also can properly handle file uploads. it's so easy that I honestly dont quite know how it works otherwise.... but maybe put into a submit handler: j('#divContainer').load(j('#form').attr('action'), j('#form').serializeObject()), and then e.preventDefault() in the form.submit()
[10:26:46] <BabySuperman> tomaw, These are all things i've done without it, and here's why: "it's so easy that I honestly dont quite know how it works otherwise" :)
[10:27:05] <djQuery> shadyKhan, evidently that has been depreciated http://www.backalleycoder.com/2012/04/25/i-want-a-damnodeinserted/
[10:27:12] <BabySuperman> tomasm- sorry not tomaw lol
[10:27:20] <BabySuperman> oh he left LOL
[10:27:53] <Stephen-B> Hi all, I'm using the jQuery validation plugin, and have run into the document issue with Chrome handling dates in the US format not using the locale, which here is the UK.  I've tried to implement the fix that I found by googling but that just breaks everything, can anyone take a look please?
[10:28:48] <djQuery> Stephen-B, see ?demo
[10:28:49] <bot-t> Stephen-B, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or if you cannot do that, provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[10:29:15] <Stephen-B> http://www.doble.co.uk/Apply-for-finance-online.asp (in chrome, scroll down to date of birth)
[10:30:48] <Stephen-B> brb
[10:31:34] <BBJames> ly really easy to do but I can't find how to simply get a new Date() at 4pm today, anybody know?
[10:31:38] <BBJames> probably*
[10:42:19] <hateIE> what a filthy rat
[10:45:00] <hateIE> when good vps's go bad ;(
[10:53:11] <Assimilater> quick question: http://fiddle.jshell.net/DDzNn/8/ how would I make the variable in treeview "branches" a method? ex $("#Explorer").treeview().branches()
[11:04:27] <TheSisb> Assimilater: doing $().fn().fn() is chaining
[11:05:10] <Assimilater> TheSisb: sorry, and?
[11:05:15] <TheSisb> so it means treeview() and branches() need to both extend $/$.fn AND treeview() needs to return this
[11:05:48] <TheSisb> it's like doing $('#explorer').treeview(); $('#explorer').branches();
[11:05:57] <TheSisb> but to chain you need to return 'this'
[11:06:20] <Assimilater> hmm
[11:06:31] <TheSisb> so that it's like doing ( $('explorer').treeview() ).branches()
[11:07:12] <TheSisb> since treeview returns this, and this is a $(this) if done right (jquery plugin conventions), then it will work
[11:10:21] <Assimilater> lol, my first attempt at plug-in modification is hurting my brain haha
[11:11:07] <TheSisb> read the plugin help page on the jquery website
[11:11:14] <Assimilater> so see how treeview has function serialize()?
[11:11:33] <Assimilater> that's not extended to $/$.fn, right?
[11:12:40] <TheSisb> function serialize is in the scrope of treeview so it's like a private function only to be used inside the treeview() function
[11:13:00] <TheSisb> treeview, expandbranch, preparebranch extend $.fn
[11:13:06] <TheSisb> "$.extend($.fn, {"
[11:13:24] <Assimilater> but calling $("#Explorer").treeview().serialize() works
[11:13:44] <Assimilater> i guess I haven't checked if jQuery has it's own
[11:13:51] <TheSisb> because it's a jquery function http://api.jquery.com/serialize/
[11:14:06] <TheSisb> lol
[11:15:09] <Assimilater> there we go, lol
[11:15:09] <Assimilater> ok, I see
[11:15:18] <Assimilater> so maybe what I really want is a get function for like .treeview('branches') then
[11:19:36] <hateIE> sweet I just fixed foundations navbar as well
[11:20:24] <hateIE> the dropdowns will actually work on mobile now :)
[11:25:57] <Assimilater> TheSisb: so how there's prepareBranches and initializeBranches is that bad jQuery plug-in practice? the plugin help page mentions not adding more than 1 namespace to $/$.fn (though maybe because they're all wrapped in {} it's ok?)
[11:36:45] <Caelum> would $('#option').attr('selected') return whether that option was defined as selected in the html? or just the current state?
[11:40:27] <hateIE> muahahah
[11:46:35] <Caelum> yeah it does
[11:46:44] <citronbleu-v> hi
[11:48:40] <Caelum> ugh, the reset code on SO is completely wrong
[11:49:07] <citronbleu-v> I am testing jQuery 1.9.1 and if there an missing attribute : <input id="test" value="test"> the function $('#test').attr('ref'); return [Object] and not null
[11:49:13] <citronbleu-v> it's normal ?
[11:50:41] <citronbleu-v> I don't view this changing in release notes
[11:54:15] <aniasis> For some reason, even tho I have set a property on the header I am unable to access it using xhr.getResponseHeader(name)
[11:54:28] <aniasis> I can only access a limited number of them
[12:06:17] <BillCriswell> I'm trying to use $('form :input[name^=foo]').map(function(){ return $(this).val(); }).join(',') but it's telling me no.... Forget what I do here.
[12:06:27] <BillCriswell> Dammit, rememebered as soon as I hit enter.
[12:06:32] <BillCriswell> .get().. Sneaky.
[12:22:53] <tay1> i have a jquery effect that i only want to happen once when i hover
[12:23:02] <tay1> i tried one(hover(.. didnt work
[12:24:08] <tay1> if i do unbind() it executs only once even if i hover back there it wont execute
[12:28:02] <BillCriswell> tay1: You can add a class or something after the animation is complete and look for it before the animation runs.
[12:28:40] <BillCriswell> if( !$(this).hasClass('doneAnimatedAlready') )
[12:29:51] <BillCriswell> if( $(this).hasClass('doneAnimatedAlready') ) return true; might be a little easier.
[12:35:06] <b-lew> Can anyone help me debug? Learning about breakpoints.
[12:36:36] <hazardous> hi, anyone know if there is simplistic way i can allow users to drag and drop divs with a certain class (reorder vertically), and have them saved in cookie or localstorage? appreciated.
[12:36:40] <hazardous> i am running jq1.8
[12:40:42] <shoky> hazardous: jquery-ui sortable. you can easily export the new order with its "serialize" or "toArray" methods
[12:46:05] <djQuery> cool http://jsbin.com/ezatet/1
[12:47:37] <shoky> :-o
[12:47:57] <shoky> cooler  http://codepen.io/stuffit/pen/KrAwx
[12:47:57] <spobat> how can I get the pure "text" of an element. example:
[12:48:06] <spobat> <span>something<div>wow</div><span>
[12:48:09] <spobat> I just want the "something"
[12:48:20] <shoky> `api text
[12:48:20] <b-ot> shoky: .text(): Get the combined text contents of each element in the set of matched elements, including their descendants. http://api.jquery.com/text/
[12:48:27] <spobat> shoky, no
[12:48:31] <spobat> that would return something wow
[12:49:04] <shoky> right, the text, which you asked about.
[12:49:10] <djQuery> shoky, seen that yesterday
[12:49:14] <shoky> anyways, maybe you want .contents()
[12:50:04] <shoky> djQuery well i was busy yesterday!
[12:50:35] <spobat> shoelessone, no :S
[12:50:48] <djQuery> shoky, thought this was cool as it allows me to combine this with ?newcontent
[12:50:55] <djQuery> ?newcontent
[12:50:57] <shoky> spobat: no .contents() ? did you even check it out
[12:51:01] <djQuery> lazy bot
[12:51:03] <shoelessone> spobat: wow, crazy
[12:51:11] <spobat> shoky, of course I did
[12:51:11] <djQuery> https://gist.github.com/gnarf37/1003630
[12:51:34] <spobat> seems to be what i need: http://viralpatel.net/blogs/jquery-get-text-element-without-child-element/
[12:52:34] <spobat> yep, that works
[12:52:41] <spobat> I still wonder if there's an easier way
[12:54:37] <shoky> spobat:  this is what i meant with .contents() http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/WxKtd/
[12:55:01] <spobat> okay
[12:58:03] <abes> how do I specify all elements of given class within an element with given class?
[12:58:07] <shoky> djQuery: didn't rly understand what you mean, not really sure whats going on in the jsbin
[12:58:16] <abes> my bad - wrong channel
[12:58:34] <djQuery> shoky, using animationstart to detect when a dom element has been added
[12:58:34] <shoky> .classA .classB
[12:58:52] <shoky> djQuery: yea that's what it looked like, is that some trick
[12:59:03] <djQuery> shoky, with this you could then apply whatever you needed to the newly added dom element
[12:59:20] <djQuery> shoky, but having trouble finding a list of what browsers support it
[13:03:37] <Caelum> does this reset function look correct: https://gist.github.com/rkitover/5266336
[13:04:15] <djQuery> shoky, but yeah its not working
[13:05:57] <Caelum> I was trying to improve on the one on SO, missing anything?
[13:08:40] <shoky> Caelum: don't .attr('value')
[13:08:53] <shoky> e.value  or $(e).val()
[13:09:16] <Caelum> shoky: ahh, thank you
[13:09:27] <shoky> also, .val accepts a function
[13:09:30] <Andrew_R> Caelum: I don't think $('option[selected]').prop('selected', true) is correct
[13:10:11] <Caelum> Andrew_R: it seemed to work in jsbin when I tried it
[13:10:14] <shoky> yeah i don't like this reset mechanism ;p
[13:10:48] <Andrew_R> you want the options all selected?
[13:10:53] <Andrew_R> and the checkboxes too?
[13:11:10] <Andrew_R> oh, I see
[13:11:27] <shoky> Caelum sorry, just realized maybe .attr('value')  IS what you intended
[13:11:31] <shoky> but uhh
[13:11:46] <Andrew_R> nevermind, $('option[selected]') will match the original HTML
[13:11:47] <shoky> i donno how good that'll work for all scenarios
[13:12:10] <tomatotomato> hi guys, i'm new to jquery  and i struggle. i have a form and the input elements are several levels down. how do i get all inputs? $('#form_foo').find('input') ... something like this?
[13:12:49] <shoky> Caelum also :input already selects the textareas and <select>s
[13:13:28] <Andrew_R> you're missing semi-colons :)
[13:13:59] <spobat> why isn't there a list of all possible "easing" values?
[13:14:00] <spobat> http://api.jquery.com/animate/
[13:14:04] <spobat> it only names the default "swing"
[13:14:37] <Andrew_R> spobat: because you need other libraries for addition easings
[13:14:42] <Andrew_R> http://api.jqueryui.com/easings/
[13:15:18] <shoky> spobat it says it on the page you linked to..
[13:16:38] <spobat> shoky sorry but I don't see the link :O
[13:16:39] <shoky> tomatotomato: yes that's one way
[13:16:52] <tomatotomato> how do i get through the elements like children() would do?
[13:16:55] <shoky> spobat: it's the paragraph titled "Easing"
[13:17:18] <tomatotomato> .find('input', function() { }) ?
[13:17:20] <shoky> tomatotomato:  .find()  returns elements just like .children() does
[13:17:21] <Caelum> what's with the semicolons? people generally tell me you're not supposed to use them in js, yet I go on jsbin and it warns me about missing semicolons
[13:17:42] <spobat> there's just a link to jQueryUI Suite
[13:17:43] <shoky> tomatotomato:  you call stuff on the return value of .find(), just like you do with .children()
[13:18:01] <tomatotomato> shoky: is that by function(element) or this?
[13:18:07] <shoky> spobat: there's a full list of provided easings: The only easing implementations in the jQuery library are the default, called swing, and one that progresses at a constant pace, called linear.
[13:18:16] <shoky> spobat: and a link to jqueryUI to get more
[13:18:18] <spobat> ..and one explaining what a "String" is, hehe
[13:18:35] <spobat> okay, got it
[13:18:39] <shoky> tomatotomato:  how would you do it with .children() ?
[13:18:42] <Andrew_R> Caelum: You should use them.
[13:18:55] <spobat> yet I still haven't found the link :O
[13:19:07] <tomatotomato> how do i attach an anonymous function instead of chain?
[13:19:13] <Andrew_R> Just one reason, if you minify your code, it will break because you no longer have whitespace separating the lines.
[13:19:16] <spobat> http://api.jqueryui.com/easings/ seems not to appear on the link I posted
[13:19:19] <shoky> Caelum: if anyone told you you're not supposed to use semi-colons in js they are big fat liars
[13:20:02] <shoky> spobat: i didn't say that link appears there
[13:20:22] <tomatotomato> actually... how do i find input with name? input[name=foo]?
[13:20:36] <shoky> tomatotomato:  maybe you meant .each() i dunno..
[13:20:40] <spobat> shoky, ah, a misunderstanding then. However, they *should* probably :}
[13:21:55] <shoky> spobat: maybe.. tho i'm sure if that were the case, many more people would be complaining that they're trying to use an easing from that page and it doesn't work
[13:22:09] <shoky> (cause they didnt know they need to also include jquery UI)
[13:23:18] <Andrew_R> Caelum: consider this code " var total += count \r\n (total > 200) ? weHaveEnough() : keepTrying()"
[13:23:51] <Andrew_R> the browser will run that as var total += count(total>200) // fail after this with syntax error
[13:24:32] <Caelum> Andrew_R: interesting
[13:30:48] <naeluh> Hi is there a way to make this more specific document.getElementsByTagName
[13:31:17] <naeluh> http://jsfiddle.net/naeluh/e6dTu/

[13:33:05] <kristofers> Any idea why on an Ajax request .success isn't working ?
[13:33:09] <kristofers> altho i'm getting a 200 back ?
[13:33:26] <NoiseEee> kristofers: crystal ball.... fuzzy
[13:34:03] <kristofers> if i replace the .success with .error it work fine
[13:36:23] <djQuery> shoky, k cool got it all working now http://jsbin.com/ezatet/2
[13:36:53] <djQuery> still looking for a list of browser that support css3 animations
[13:37:29] <djQuery> anyone got ie10 to test this out for me? http://jsbin.com/ezatet/2
[13:38:23] <djQuery> kristofers, did you shake a dead chicken at it?
[13:38:47] <kristofers> tried but it didn't return anything
[13:48:12] <BabySuperman> how do I upload a file via ajax WITHOUT redirecting?  Do I need to use an iframe?
[13:48:39] <NoiseEee> or xhr2
[13:48:58] <BabySuperman> NoiseEee, how with xhr2?!
[13:49:02] <BabySuperman> i def don't want to use an iframe
[13:49:41] <NoiseEee> http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/file/xhr2/ @ BabySuperman
[13:50:05] <BabySuperman> where do I cancel the refresh?
[13:50:33] <pachet> what refresh
[13:50:34] <pachet> its xhr
[13:50:45] <BabySuperman> not if I send a file
[13:50:53] <BabySuperman> its behavior chances and causes redirect
[13:51:03] <djQuery> ggrr why am I not getting 10 divs http://jsbin.com/ezatet/2/edit
[13:52:27] <Andrew_R> NoiseEee: I'm interested in XHR2 as well. Do you know how well browsers support this?
[13:52:37] <Andrew_R> I guess I mean specifically IE :(
[13:52:56] <Soviet-san> ello
[13:53:06] <NoiseEee> Andrew_R: http://caniuse.com/xhr2 :)
[13:53:19] <Soviet-san> I'm having problems getting fancybox to work. Can anyone help? http://tammsfd.com/gallery
[13:53:54] <Andrew_R> NoiseEee: Thank you. I see, not until IE10, of course...
[13:54:08] <djQuery> Soviet-san, not public
[13:54:16] <Soviet-san> oops
[13:54:28] <Soviet-san> sorry it's http://tammsfd.com/gallery.php
[13:55:30] <djQuery> Soviet-san, Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 500 (Internal Server Error) http://tammsfd.com/gallery/js/fancybox/source/jquery.fancybox.pack.js?v=2.1.4
[13:55:54] <Soviet-san> Could that be a chmod issue?
[13:55:56] <djQuery> Soviet-san, and a bunch of other js not loading
[13:57:39] <Soviet-san> djQuery what could be causing that? the paths are correct.
[13:57:42] <Unode> hi everyone
[13:58:04] <djQuery> Soviet-san, dunno
[13:59:10] <djQuery> Soviet-san, sounds like a Q for ##php
[13:59:21] <Soviet-san> ok thanks
[13:59:36] <Unode> I'm trying to reuse a function which is used elsewhere as $(function). I know this is just another way of triggering the .ready() behavior and that .ready() passes $ as first argument by default.
[13:59:57] <Commander_Cody> djQuery: thank you for the link try.jquery.com you gave me this morning. It is outstanding and simply awesome!
[14:00:17] <Unode> What I'm confused about is how to reuse this function elsewhere considering that it doesn't use the content of the first argument.
[14:01:08] <Unode> As it is now I get myfunction(arg) where arg is a "string" and it works as expected, but when used with .ready() arg is a function (or $) and it breaks.
[14:01:51] <djQuery> dang it why arent my divs being created? http://jsbin.com/ezatet/2/edit
[14:02:03] <Unode> should I do typeof arg === "function" or is there a better way of doing it?
[14:03:29] <djQuery> function ready(){}    $(ready)
[14:03:37] <djQuery> Unode, ^^
[14:03:47] <djQuery> if you name the function then you can call it again later
[14:04:07] <Unode> djQuery, I already have that, but I'm trying to reuse the function
[14:04:47] <djQuery> $(document).ready(function(){ myfunky();});
[14:04:56] <Unode> let me paste some code to explain
[14:04:59] <Gazpacho> is there a jquery plugin for jquery
[14:05:24] <Gazpacho> i like jquery so i want a jquery plugin that lets me jquery while i jquery
[14:06:02] <djQuery> Gazpacho, sure here $.fn.jquery = $;
[14:06:09] <djQuery> Gazpacho, anything else?
[14:09:56] <joesavage> I feel like this must be asked like every second of every day, but I've tried reading a bunch of stuff and a bunch of different methods and I just can't get something working.

[14:14:32] <Unode> djQuery, http://jsbin.com/oletoc/1/edit
[14:14:37] <acidjazz> dong jquery
[14:18:22] <Soviet-san> djQuery
[14:18:26] <Soviet-san> I fixed the first issue
[14:18:37] <Soviet-san> However the problem with it not working still exists

[15:19:39] <Selena> Hello, i have a question! I'm trying to make a Jquery detection when user reach the bottom of a DIV, how can i do that?
[15:20:53] <euxneks> for jquery mobile, is there a way to make just the widget the expandable control, while allowing the header element to be an anchor to something else?
[15:20:56] <tseth> hey. I'm having issues with jquery mobile and backbone.... I'm trying to use the backbone router, and for some reason, when I use jquery mobile, it keeps trying to run ajax requests....
[15:21:05] <tseth> how do I handle that?
[15:21:34] <euxneks> err.. for accordion elements
[15:22:41] <euxneks> heck, even just for collapsible elements
[15:23:33] <tseth> apparently jquery is trying to overrule my backbone.js' router.
[15:23:42] <tseth> does anoyone know how I can stop it from doing that?
[15:26:14] <Selena> Hello everyone, how could i detect when user reach bottom of page with jquery? but i have a div id="body"> </div> that i want to detect it for
[15:26:15] <Selena> how ?
[15:27:27] <tseth> also, Why in the HELL does JQuery mobile think I want to randomly send an ajax request?
[15:32:46] <tds5016> does anyone know how to stop jqm from making random ajax requests?     $.mobile.ajaxEnabled = false; appears not to work...
[15:39:16] <shankstaBytes> will this work?
[15:39:17] <shankstaBytes> $(this) != $('#password')
[15:39:27] <brian___> hey guys, not sure if this is the right room for this question, but I'm trying to use the twitter bootstrap affix plugin. I've got it working fine, but I'm changing the offset based on browser width and i can't seem to get bootstrap to recognize the new offset. been googling for a while .. any thoughts?
[15:48:49] <tds5016> hey. can someone please help me figure out how to kill jqm's router from doign things like sending out random ajax requests, etc?
[15:49:07] <tds5016> I want backbone to handle all of this in its own way, and I want jquery mobile to stop from doing that.
[15:49:23] <tds5016> $.mobile.ajaxEnabled = false; appears not to stop the requests.
[15:51:28] <tds5016> I've been fighting with this for a while, and it's infuriating how difficult it it to change that behavior.
[15:53:45] <mlq> hello, i have a problem: i have a div container A which contains some other divs B and C - i have connected a handle for the click event on all of them, my problem now is that if i click on B or C, the click event is triggered on A as well - therefore i call event.stopPropagation(0 in the event handlers from B and C, but this apparently does not help - can anyone help me out?
[16:00:28] <mlq> thats odd, apparently it just works on B and not on C in firefox, but in both in chromium
[16:01:03] <anli_> mlq: return false in the event handler
[16:01:08] <anli_> thats all you need to do
[16:01:23] <anli_> will stop propagation, I think it also prevents default
[16:01:28] <anli_> else, e.preventDefault() is needed
[16:03:05] <mlq> anli_: okay, that works :) thanks
[16:24:12] <raj> is there a maintained alternative to this polyfill? https://github.com/miketaylr/jQuery-html5-placeholder
[16:29:16] <b-lew> this is working… it shows the item then removes it. superbox.find('.royalSlider').remove(); but i want it so that if I click again it shows the item again and it isn't doing that … its still hidden.
[16:36:55] <initself> so you can't do
[16:36:55] <initself> return if self.closest('span.excel_off').text() == '1';
[16:37:00] <initself> in javascript?
[16:37:18] <initself> what's the prefered way?
[16:37:25] <initself> if () { return; } ?
[16:37:34] <initself> if () { return false; } ?
[16:51:03] <initself> i am not sure why the fiddle doesn't see anything in span.excel_off
[16:51:04] <initself> http://jsfiddle.net/NA9Hh/2/

[17:02:26] <Assimilater> does jquery ui's spinner have a way to restrict to integer (non-decimal) values or would I have to validate that?
[17:18:39] <mamajama> hey whats up
[17:18:46] <mamajama> noob question here
[17:18:58] <mamajama> can i use jquery in an email? How?
[17:19:16] <mamajama> i want to create a hide reveal effect for some text
[17:19:31] <vladikoff> mamajama, no.
[17:19:41] <mamajama> hmm ;-(
[17:19:46] <j_wright> you'd be lucky if the mail client allows javascript to run
[17:20:29] <mamajama> so i am just starting out with making emails and i am finding it dificult to learn what the best coding practice is.
[17:21:00] <mamajama> what is the accepted method for laying out text and images in emails so they don't look like a load of crap
[17:21:35] <mamajama> and what sort of effects are there that can be used
[17:21:38] <snover> the accepted method is to go look at the state of the art of web development circa 1999
[17:21:41] <snover> and do that
[17:21:57] <j_wright> use attached files with your style, and point to them with cid: or use inline styles
[17:22:02] <mamajama> you mean send a letter by snailmail right?
[17:23:11] <vladikoff> mamajama, yes.
[17:23:35] <mamajama> and how does that stuff show up if the email client is blocking photos etc untill accepted is it just going to look lame untill they download attachments
[17:24:10] <vladikoff> mamajama, we don't do email here, we do jQuery. Sorry.
[17:24:56] <j_wright> mamajama: learn to write html that doesn't look like crap when your images don't load
[17:26:54] <ravenz> j_wright ++ to your last msg
[17:27:48] <ravenz> mamajama forget about js on emails, you shouldn't even use html or css
[17:28:58] <ezakimak> snover, is correct. the best you'll get in emails is careful use of tables for layout
[17:28:58] <j_wright> you want pretty looking emails?  attach a pdf
[17:29:52] <mamajama> for example how do apple create their emails that have all the nice layout etc is that just html?
[17:30:06] <ezakimak> open one and look at how they did it
[17:31:29] <ezakimak> don't forget to send a plain text body part also--some people turn off html email
[17:36:22] <mamajama> thanks ezakimak
[17:36:27] <mamajama> thanks ravenz
[17:36:31] <mamajama> thanks j_wright
[17:36:43] <vladikoff> thanks mamajama
[17:36:47] <mamajama> preesh.
[17:36:51] <mamajama> l8r
[17:38:20] <vladikoff> thanks snover
[17:39:16] <snover> thanks vladikoff
[17:42:09] <chee> thanks snover

[17:42:35] <chee> i love you
[17:47:36] <chee> jQuery.callbacks is cool?
[17:47:57] <b-lew> are there docs to reinitialize a slider on my click function?
[17:49:13] <chee> b-lew: pardon
[17:50:57] <b-lew> well I have a click function that is showing a slider then hiding it and when I click to show it again it doesn't reappear
[17:51:00] <b-lew> if that makes sense.
[17:51:34] <ner0x> How can I fire the event for an <input type="file"> so that it opens the window?
[17:53:12] <smakatak> if i have the parent object of a <td> element (which would be the <tr>) that i found, how do i access the <tr>'s td elements?
[17:56:11] <chee> smakatak: i'd be all like:    tr.find( 'td' );
[17:56:49] <b-lew> I made a SO for it. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15694392/show-hide-gallery
[17:57:29] <smakatak> chee: and what does that return
[17:58:05] <chee> smakatak: a jQuizzy object full of the td elemtnts that were the childrens of that tr
[17:58:06] <vladikoff> ner0x, not reliable, but something like this http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6463439/how-to-open-a-file-browse-dialog-using-javascript google for more info on the situation
[17:58:13] <smakatak> well the .text() of that returns the data of all the td elements
[17:58:25] <smakatak> i would like to select 1 of those td elements in particular
[17:58:52] <chee> smakatak: tr.find( 'td' ).eq( 2 ) will get you the third elemunt
[18:00:17] <smakatak> chee: nice. thanks. is there any difference between .find and .children in this case?
[18:02:16] <Caelum> iframeAutoHeight plugin doesn't handle the iframe growing due to javascript and such
[18:02:30] <vladikoff> smakatak, http://stackoverflow.com/questions/648004/what-is-fastest-children-or-find-in-jquery
[18:03:40] <Caelum> is there something like a dom-change event I could bind to an iframe document (on the same domain of course) ?
[18:04:12] <smakatak> vladikoff: cool thanks.
[18:04:14] <chee> smakatak: as vladikoff says. talking csswise, .children is like 'tr > td' and .find is like 'tr td'
[18:04:39] <chee> thanks vladikoff
[18:04:44] <vladikoff> thanks chee
[18:04:48] <chee> thanks snover
[18:05:19] <snover> i still love you
[18:05:34] <chee> i still love you
[18:05:52] <smakatak> cool. 1 more question. if want to iterate over juse one particular column in the able looking for a particular value instead of every td, how can i do that
[18:06:04] <smakatak> right now i have $("td").each
[18:10:47] <sahbeewah> $("td:first-child").each / $("td:nth-child").each
[18:11:14] <sahbeewah> nth-child(n), rather
[18:11:45] <smakatak> gotcha thanks
[18:14:46] <brian___> hey everyone, tried asking this earlier but didnt get a response and had to leave. im using twitter bootstrap affix on a responsive layout. the offset changes at each breakpoint. im able to udpate the data-offset-top attribute just fine, but bootstrap isnt recognizing the new value. dose anyone have any ideas? ive been googling for a while now and everyone says to set it via js which ive also tried. help much appreciated.
[18:15:49] <kortank> I'm having some trouble with special events. I'm trying to add a tripleclick event but it does not work using "parent.on('tripleclick', '.element', function() { ... }); Thanks in advance.
[18:18:17] <brian___> here's a gist of the function thats being called if this helps: https://gist.github.com/briansw/5268118
[18:28:34] <Caelum> ok, so no dom change events in IE8, I'm shit out of luck
[18:29:01] <Caelum> is there maybe a window size change event?
[18:29:36] <Caelum> aha, .resize(), sweet
[18:30:12] <brian___> Caelum: might wanna wrap that in a timout so it's not running constantly on resize
[18:31:48] <shoky> depends what you're doing inside
[18:34:17] <shoky> kortank: can you make a demo/jsfiddle of the issue
[18:35:06] <kortank> Sure one sec
[18:37:28] <Caelum> except that doesn't exactly do what I want, resize triggers when the user resizes the window but I need something to trigger when the javascript makes the page bigger
[18:39:37] <kortank> Here's the fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/dEntm/
[18:39:47] <Caelum> is the only way to do that to set a timeout that monitors the size?
[18:41:08] <coldhead> http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-resize-plugin/
[18:44:41] <Caelum> coldhead: neat, thank you
[18:48:01] <sifu_> hello folks...can anyone tell me how to overcome this a bug in this drop down select (once a value is selected, it is not displayed from the subsequent ddls) but curently it only works when there is two ddl, when it's more than two...it doesn't work...http://jsfiddle.net/Vr3Bq/8/
[18:49:01] <ragas> hello
[18:49:42] <shoky> kortank: your event isn't working for me even without delegation..
[18:50:02] <jailbirdzentest> Is there a way to return HTML partials via cross-site ajax like JSON with JSONP? I can't seem to find anything
[18:50:48] <ragas> i have an image i linked to an anchor; then added a jq function to focus to a field.  They work individually, but dont seem to work together.
[18:51:30] <Caelum> jailbirdzentest: with CORS you should be able to do any kind of ajax
[18:53:40] <jailbirdzentest> Caelum: thanks, I'll take a look
[19:07:52] <shoky> kortank:  see http://learn.jquery.com/events/event-extensions/
[19:08:06] <shoky> kortank: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/dEntm/1/
[19:15:13] <bonhoeffer> i want to click on a button and have all div's of class .foo toggle their visibility
[19:15:26] <bonhoeffer> i'm sure this is very simple, if i just knew the right function
[19:16:52] <vladikoff> bonhoeffer, http://api.jquery.com/toggleClass/ http://api.jquery.com/toggle/
[19:16:55] <vladikoff> bonhoeffer, see examples
[19:16:59] <brian___>  $('.my_button_to_hide_foo').click(function(){ $('.foo').toggleClass('show hide') });
[19:18:45] <brian___> this reinitialize bootstrap affix issue has me completely stumped. if anyone can help id greatly appreciate it
[19:22:00] <bonhoeffer> thanks!
[19:29:34] <bonhoeffer> i don't get it: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/5268339
[19:29:52] <bonhoeffer> it looks like the hide class is being added, but the div's are not disappearing
[19:30:01] <bonhoeffer> when i inspect with chrome, the hide class is not being added
[19:32:43] <bonhoeffer> that might be because an array of objects is returned
[19:33:01] <bonhoeffer> $(".calendar_report.flossed")
[19:33:11] <bonhoeffer> returns n > 1 results
[19:34:31] <bonhoeffer> oh -- hide is taking -- and i see why
[19:53:44] <nick_omega>  is the 'about us' menu at telerik.com jquery?
[19:55:00] <vladikoff> nick_omega, yes http://www.telerik.com/assets/js/cachedResources/634964293518901093/sitenavigation.js
[19:56:04] <Andrew_R> I like that, buy our $1000 HTML5 "controls" or do it yourself with jQuery.
[19:56:38] <nick_omega> vladikoff is that determined simply with firebug
[19:57:11] <nick_omega> maybe firequery
[19:57:14] <nick_omega>  is needed?
[19:57:28] <Andrew_R> I found it with Firebug
[19:57:46] <nick_omega> is it easy to explain how
[19:57:55] <nick_omega> you did that
[19:58:30] <nick_omega> i was clicking on console in firebug then the element and expected to see something there
[19:59:29] <Andrew_R> I used the "Click on any element" and found the About Us link in the HTML. Then I saw the hidden form right below that with the "sitenav-about-us-panel" id, so I switched to the Script tab and searched for that and found the sitenavigation.js file.
[19:59:38] <Andrew_R> There is probably an easier way.
[20:00:20] <Andrew_R> the console tab won't show messages unless they are specifically sent there (or errors, ajax, etc)
[20:02:42] <nick_omega> andrew_r you found sitenav-about-us-panel in that js script, eh?
[20:02:58] <Andrew_R> just search
[20:03:53] <nick_omega> i found it... i was expecting the script tab to only display js
[20:03:56] <nick_omega> code
[20:04:21] <naeluh> hey can some one gimme a hand this div just immediately fades right out http://jsfiddle.net/naeluh/nCbnA/ I want to fade out and fadein the next one on click thanks I hope someone can help
[20:04:34] <Caelum> coldhead: that plugin doesn't work on the body of an iframe
[20:06:07] <Caelum> coldhead: oh wait, imdoingitwrong
[20:06:09] <naeluh> I just am not sure how to get it to fadeOut one and then fade out the other onclick
[20:06:16] <naeluh> it seems like I am really close
[20:06:29] <nick_omega> andrew_r can you tell if thats custom js or a module i can download
[20:07:19] <nick_omega> andrew_r can you also tell if asp.net code is used alongside that js
[20:07:51] <Caelum> coldhead: nope, doesn't work
[20:08:32] <Andrew_R> Telerik markets custom ASP.NET controls and MVC extensions, so I would say custom (their own controls) and yes.
[20:09:48] <nick_omega> andrew_r so if i want to examine the asp.net code i'll want to use something besides firebug
[20:10:00] <Andrew_R> you can't
[20:10:04] <Andrew_R> there would be no way to get it
[20:10:53] <Andrew_R> you could examine the HTML output though
[20:12:11] <naeluh> basically its just thumbnails that fadein and fade out divs ?
[20:12:30] <Andrew_R> yeah pretty much
[20:13:31] <nick_omega> examine the html output
[20:14:13] <nick_omega> in firebug i assume
[20:14:30] <relipse>  anyone know of a tool to resend ajax requests and slightly change parameters on a webpage? (like in chrome an addon) ?
[20:14:58] <Andrew_R> relipse: you could do it with Fiddler
[20:15:17] <Andrew_R> but that would be independent from the page
[20:15:17] <relipse> i need to do it for a particular webppage
[20:15:25] <consideratio> i just fell in love with jquery for letting me select $(.row-fluid:not(.important))
[20:16:01] <Andrew_R> relipse: Firebug and use console to initiate the request?
[20:16:49] <relipse> chrome can do that too, i want to quickly take out a few parameters
[20:16:54] <relipse> and then send the request
[20:17:06] <relipse> and see results
[20:17:28] <relipse> i think i know how to do it
[20:17:31] <relipse> just delete some of the form fields
[20:23:28] <coldhead> Caelum: iframes are hard
[20:30:15] <tw2113> *bites his tongue on snide remark regarding "hard" *
[20:32:33] <naeluh> is there maybe a way to make a close button?
[20:32:44] <Caelum> coldhead: meh, I'll just loop a setTimeout, that's how this plugin works anyway
[20:39:49] <Caelum> what's a good polling frequency for a good visual response without eating unnecessary CPU
[20:48:16] <nick_omega> is there a module for download that behaves similarly to the 'about us' menu at http://www.telerik.com that someone could link to
[20:55:06] <relipse> I have 2 text files with a list of keys and values, the list is long, is there an easy way to (sort them?) and match them up to see what keys are the same?
[20:58:08] <tw2113> programmatically or just somehow
[21:49:13] <raj> if I'm gonna give details on a picture, such as filesize, location, format, date taken, etc, should I use dl/dt/dd?
[21:49:20] <snover> maybe
[21:49:46] <raj> how should I make that decision?
[21:49:58] <coldhead> i would consult the tarot
[21:50:25] <raj> don't know how to read those
[21:50:29] <snover> try a magic 8 ball then
[21:50:46] <raj> i broke mine when I was 10
[21:51:14] <raj> so, intellectually, how should I make the decision?
[21:54:32] <Foxhoundz> raj: do it according to the w3c specification
[21:56:07] <raj> w3schools?
[21:56:15] <raj> I kid, I kid
[21:58:29] <coldhead> ohohohohohoho
[21:58:51] <Foxhoundz> raj: I would just stick to regular tables
[21:59:01] <Foxhoundz> for the sake of supporting legacy browsers
[21:59:13] <Foxhoundz> Unless you use something like modernizr or something
[21:59:26] <adjen> hi
[21:59:32] <adjen> i discover a new great exploit to get root take a look  http://ro0t.dyndns-server.com/
[22:00:32] <coldhead> i don't like this adjen
[22:04:40] <Foxhoundz> that's not suspicious at all
[22:04:46] <jaequery> question
[22:05:14] <raj> Foxhoundz, looks prett ysupported http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_dl.asp
[22:05:35] <raj> jaequery, what?
[22:05:36] <Foxhoundz> It existed pre html5 I believe
[22:06:00] <Foxhoundz> Never used dl
[22:06:11] <jaequery> lets say im creating an embeddable widget, that lazyloads twitter boostrap css so i can take use of its UI.   but on a site that already has it's own twitter bootstrap,   how can you handle the conflicts between the two?
[22:13:18] <ragas> how can it be that JQ is loading in safari but not firefox??
[22:13:32] <Andrew_R> man I am tempted to click that link
[22:17:32] <jaequery> does laravel not support named bind parameters?
[22:17:42] <jaequery> wrong paste
[22:17:48] <jaequery> lets say im creating an embeddable widget, that lazyloads twitter boostrap css so i can take use of its UI.   but on a site that already has it's own twitter bootstrap,   how can you handle the conflicts between the two?
[22:18:39] <coldhead> by going back to bed
[22:18:52] <coldhead> ain't nobody got time to deal with css conflicts
[22:20:39] <Foxhoundz> jaequery: it's a tough one
[22:20:47] <Foxhoundz> jaequery: maybe something like this? http://jsbin.com/uyajif/6/edit
[22:21:03] <Caelum> I wish people wrote objects instead of functions with private functions for plugins
[22:22:24] <jaequery> Foxhoundz: yea but some have customized bootstrap css
[22:22:32] <jaequery> and so my bootstrap will be different
[22:22:56] <jaequery> any way i can just have my own bootstrap in my own namespace?
[22:29:38] <Caelum> coldhead: hey I got it working!
[22:31:19] <coldhead> good job Caelum
[22:31:27] <coldhead> why don't you treat yourself to a short break
[23:11:32] <ruby_on_tails> hello
[23:13:37] <RandalSchwartz> ruby. nice experiment.  great prototype for perl6
[23:14:19] <ruby_on_tails> RandalSchwartz: ?
[23:15:05] <RandalSchwartz> ! :)
[23:16:05] <RandalSchwartz> well - if you're a ruby hacker, you're using the bastard stepchild of my favorite two languages - perl and smalltalk, and the feed into my new language - perl6
[23:16:28] <RandalSchwartz> so thank you for proving the intermediate product
[23:17:25] <vladikoff> this new p2p node.js app is cool https://github.com/InstantWebP2P/iwebpp.io if anyone is interested
[23:18:24] <ruby_on_tails> RandalSchwartz: i dont code ruby, perl, or smalltalk, sorry
[23:19:46] <RandalSchwartz> why are you "ruby_on..." then?
[23:20:17] <coldhead> i think they pay him to advertise their product
[23:20:45] <coldhead> he's like duff man
[23:20:51] <ruby_on_tails> whats duff ?
[23:21:03] * RandalSchwartz waits for answers
[23:21:16] <coldhead> so you don't know ruby OR duff?
[23:21:25] <coldhead> you should change your /nick
[23:21:27] <ruby_on_tails> RandalSchwartz: they pay me
[23:21:30] <ruby_on_tails> hence the name
[23:21:35] <RandalSchwartz> "they"?
[23:21:46] <ruby_on_tails> (11:50:18  IST) coldhead: i think "they" pay him to advertise their product
[23:21:52] <ruby_on_tails> they ^^
[23:22:07] <RandalSchwartz> so wait... you're a spammer?
[23:22:31] <ruby_on_tails> RandalSchwartz: do you have op permissions in this channel ?
[23:22:55] <RandalSchwartz> that's irrelevant
[23:22:59] <raj> would it be better to have a thumbsup/thumbsdown image, or just use thumbsup and rotate it for thumbsdown?
[23:23:03] <RandalSchwartz> I can still claim things that are true
[23:23:16] <RandalSchwartz> and others will act on that :)
[23:23:19] <raj> i was planning on using an img tag in a button
[23:23:28] <RandalSchwartz> so what keeps you from begin a spammer?
[23:23:30] <raj> hopefully that's valid
[23:23:31] <ruby_on_tails> RandalSchwartz: then yea i do spam
[23:23:33] <RandalSchwartz> being
[23:23:58] * RandalSchwartz awakens the channel gods
[23:24:04] <coldhead> ruby_on_tails: i think the best thing for you to do is learn ruby
[23:24:08] <coldhead> then when people ask you about it
[23:24:10] <coldhead> AND THEY WILL
[23:24:12] <coldhead> WITH THAT NAME
[23:24:14] <ruby_on_tails> raj: if the image rotates symettrically, better use it, but you will have to check on how you rotate it, css3 transforms are not supported in older browsers
[23:24:16] <coldhead> you can answer usefully
[23:24:25] <xdjuj__> ruby need to die :)
[23:24:29] <xdjuj__> That's awfull
[23:24:37] <RandalSchwartz> ruby is not ba
[23:24:38] <RandalSchwartz> bad
[23:24:40] <xdjuj__> Is huge and heavy
[23:24:41] <raj> ruby_on_tails, how old?
[23:24:43] <RandalSchwartz> it's smalltalk + perl
[23:24:45] <ruby_on_tails> coldhead: hmm, i will think about that, but the issue is i am more of a frontend guy
[23:24:53] <xdjuj__> Really not a good idea on production sites
[23:25:14] <RandalSchwartz> ruby_on_tails - please type /part #jquery
[23:25:38] <raj> not until he answers my question
[23:25:42] <ruby_on_tails> raj: http://caniuse.com/transforms2d
[23:26:00] <raj> ruby_on_tails, so button with a background maybe?
[23:26:16] <raj> id' like to support IE8
[23:26:23] <ruby_on_tails> then use two images
[23:26:25] <ruby_on_tails> up and down
[23:26:53] <raj> well, if I use a background image instead, for the button, can't I just flip it?
[23:27:10] <RandalSchwartz> IE is the WTF there
[23:27:17] <RandalSchwartz> stupid f'ing microsoft
[23:28:54] <ruby_on_tails> raj: i am not sure you can flip BGs but you could ask in #css
[23:31:48] <ruby_on_tails> RandalSchwartz: where are your mod gods ?
[23:33:09] <raj> ruby_on_tails, http://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/flip-an-image/
[23:33:11] <raj> pretty cool
