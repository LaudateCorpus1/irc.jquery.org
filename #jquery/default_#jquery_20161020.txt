[04:02:28] <TheDude> Hie to all
[04:02:31] <TheDude> *hi
[04:02:35] <TheDude> I would have need an advice
[04:03:49] <TheDude> My situation is this: I have an animation in hiding a form with jquery (using jQuery UI)
[04:04:47] <TheDude> this animation occurs differently depending on the browser
[04:05:02] <TheDude> with chrome is really fast
[04:05:14] <TheDude> with firefox is normal
[04:06:00] <TheDude> question:  Is there a way to set an option only for a specific browser(chrome)?
[04:06:49] <TheDude> I mean with jQuery or if there is a better way to do that
[04:07:16] <Cork> no, not really
[04:07:26] <Cork> and it is normally a bad idea
[04:07:38] <Cork> cause it locks that browser into that state
[04:07:55] <Cork> so if they ever fix what ever you see as the problem, they either don't get the fix
[04:08:05] <Cork> or will have to start hacking around to get you to show it
[04:08:11] <Cork> aka. breaking the web
[04:08:25] <Cork> TheDude: have you tried doing the animation with css3?
[04:13:06] <TheDude> Cork: for example by assigning a CSS class that contains options for making animations?
[04:13:17] <Cork> yes
[04:13:30] <Cork> or more specifically transitions
[04:14:18] <TheDude> you are right, the correct term is "transitions"
[04:14:37] <Cork> well there are animations too, but what you need is transitions
[04:16:29] <TheDude> I will try. I wanted to use jquery ui to avoid having to implement the transition (I'm not sure how to do it)
[04:17:20] <Cork> TheDude: if you can provide an example of what you are trying to do in a jsfiddle.net i could give you some help
[04:33:55] <TheDude> Cork: I did a simple example
[04:34:03] <TheDude> Cork: https://jsfiddle.net/75suojfy/2/
[04:35:08] <TheDude> Into my code I don't use "div" but "form". But the concept is the same
[05:18:03] <joaocastanho> hi :)
[05:25:23] <joaocastanho> anyone here who knows bootstrap tour, can help me hide the "next" button when the tour ends?
[05:25:35] <joaocastanho> I know it's something with next -1
[06:22:04] <jomofcw> Hello !
[06:22:24] <joaocastanho> I'm having problems playing audio in mobile
[06:22:38] <joaocastanho> new Audio("file.mp3").play();
[06:22:44] <joaocastanho> only working in desktop
[06:23:18] <jomofcw> Using jQuery UI, is there a way to get the tooltip element, inside the function of the "content" property ? i.e. I'm loading the content of the tooltip using AJAX and I want to insert that content in the tooltip element as soon as it is loaded.
[06:25:47] <your_new_nick> jomofcw, $.get('whatever', function(data) { $('#tooltip').html(data); }); ?
[06:26:02] <your_new_nick> or $.post or $.ajax whatever you need
[06:26:57] <your_new_nick> jomofcw, you also got http://api.jquery.com/load/
[06:27:05] <jomofcw> your_new_nick hello ! Oh ! OK, that's a good ide a^^. And, so you perform this on the hover event ?
[06:27:24] <your_new_nick> ohcibi, I still had the silly nick
[06:27:28] <jomofcw> Oh no, I understand it bad.
[06:27:36] <jomofcw> rollingWolf ^^.
[06:28:30] <jomofcw> Hm in fact I would like to avoid the use of a "$('#tooltip')" to be sure that the content will be attach to the right tooltip
[06:28:33] <jomofcw> :/
[06:29:10] <rollingWolf> $('#tooltip').load('ajax/listwithtooltips #tool_tip_1');
[06:31:06] <jomofcw> rollingWolf OK there is a callback in fact. Here is the right way to do it : http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13175268/ajax-content-in-a-jquery-ui-tooltip-widget
[07:09:24] <joaocastanho> anyone around?
[07:09:30] <joaocastanho> how can I play audio in mobile browser?
[07:58:50] <rddd> Hi there, I'm having some trouble with transition animation of table row height, I was told transitions don't like height auto so I had to calculate height and nothing seems to be happening when I remove the height afterwards... can anybody see what's wrong with this? http://codepen.io/anon/pen/ozQJQw?editors=1111
[08:22:21] <joaocastanho> Hello. I'm having problems with audio on mobile
[08:23:22] <joaocastanho> new Audio("file.mp3").play();
[08:32:54] <ndee> Hi there, I have a function like this: $.fn.foobar = function () { and that function contains multiple more functions. How can I overwrite one of the sub-functions of $.fn.foobar ?
[08:40:54] <rddd> functions containing functions are objects - just continue dot notation the the level you want: $.fn.foobar.subFunction.deeperSubFunction = function(){}...
[08:41:01] <rddd> *to the
[08:41:26] <rddd> ( ndee )
[09:04:16] <rddd> ok back
[09:14:55] <Cork> rddd: if the function returns an object with function references you can't mod them through $.fn
[09:15:28] <rddd> ..oh.
[09:15:58] <Cork> rddd: the function executes when you call it
[09:16:07] <Cork> and it returns a new object with values
[09:16:18] <Cork> those values are what you want to modify
[09:16:31] <Cork> but as it doesn't exist before the function executes, you can't modify them
[09:17:17] <rddd> i think what you're looking for is extend()
[09:17:32] <rddd> jquery has it's own method for adding functions to it
[09:17:42] <rddd> or even selector expressions
[09:19:26] <rddd> $.expr[':'].whateverPseudoSelectorNameYouLike = function(obj) { ...
[09:20:18] <rddd> $.fn.extend( objectToMergeOntoJQueryPrototype );
[09:20:20] <rddd> is what you want
[09:20:23] <rddd> there you go
[09:20:54] <rddd> the objectTo.... is just { 'functionName': function(blah...){blah...}
[09:21:00] <rddd> sorted =)
[09:21:21] <rddd> https://api.jquery.com/jquery.fn.extend/
[09:24:05] <ndee> sweetness,t hanks
[09:25:46] <ndee> I don't want to extend jquery directly but the jquery.fn.foobar so I guess this one is the correct one: https://api.jquery.com/jQuery.extend/ no?
[09:26:54] <rddd> jQuery.extend() is for $.functionName functions, jQuery.fn.extend() is for $.fn.functionName functions
[09:27:04] <rddd> (i think)
[09:27:06] <rddd> could be wrong
[09:27:19] <rddd> check those help pages ;P
[09:30:19] <Cork> rddd: those are for adding things to $.fn and the selector parser
[09:30:28] <Cork> not part of function returns
[09:31:23] <Cork> the only way you can modify the function from $.fn is if the function in question is attached to that object
[09:32:05] <Cork> but that is normally a bad idea for sub functions, cause that pollutes the public scope of jquery
[09:32:52] <ndee> Cork: so when I have $.fn.foobar = function () {, to overwrite a function, I would have to use $.extend($.fn.foobar, {functionToOverwrite: function().... ?
[09:33:16] <Cork> no
[09:33:24] <Cork> you can't access it at all from there
[09:33:49] <Cork> if you had $.fn.holder = { foobar: function(), foobaz: function() {} };
[09:33:57] <Cork> you could extend $.fn.holder
[09:34:21] <Cork> but in this case the syntax is $.fn.foobar = function() { return { baz: function() {} } }
[09:34:30] <Cork> and there is no way what so ever to access that function from $.fn
[09:34:42] <ndee> ok
[09:34:47] <Cork> except through $().foobar().baz
[09:35:01] <Cork> but each execution of $().foobar() gives you a new copy of a new function
[09:35:13] <Cork> so you can't globally replace it
[09:35:22] <Cork> (well you can but not easily
[09:35:23] <Cork> )
[09:36:48] <Cork> what you can do is (function() { var orgFooBar = $.fn.foobar; $.fn.foobar = function() { var ret = orgFooBar.apply(this, arguments); ret.baz = function() {}; return ret; }); })()
[09:37:26] <Cork> and as long as noone stores the function reference (and noone should do that for $.fn) that should give you the possibility to replace that function
[09:37:31] <Cork> but that is really the only way
[09:56:30] <JosefDe> Hi
[09:56:47] <JosefDe> How can I replace a page's Browser-cache-entry with the last Ajax-query I've done?
[09:57:08] <Cork> you can't
[09:57:25] <Cork> that would be cache poisoning
[10:25:47] <TheDude> hi, How can I set the "readonly" or "disabled" attribute of an "input" with jQuery? and How can I remove it?
[10:26:50] <rddd> $("input").attr('readonly', 'readonly')
[10:27:00] <rddd> $("input").removeAttr('readonly')
[10:27:21] <taplar> $('input').prop('disabled', true)
[10:27:37] <taplar> may can do the same with readonly as well
[10:27:43] <rddd> is readonly accessible under .prop?
[10:27:45] <rddd> ah
[10:27:47] <rddd> cool
[10:27:51] <taplar> i'd have to fiddle it.
[10:28:25] <rddd> i'm pretty sure disabled attribude should be set to 'disabled', not 'true'
[10:28:33] <rddd> *attribute
[10:28:37] <taplar> your setting the dom property, not the attribute
[10:28:41] <rddd> oic
[10:28:42] <taplar> with prop()
[10:29:37] <rddd> are you familiar with nimationtransition? I can't get this to work: http://codepen.io/anon/pen/ozQJQw?editors=1111
[10:29:46] <rddd> *animation transitions
[10:31:42] <new-to-json> Does anyone in here know some stuff on JSON?
[10:31:51] <taplar> hmmm
[10:31:58] <taplar> new-to-json: ask your q man
[10:32:14] <rddd> aha I got it to work on getting smaller
[10:32:18] <rddd> just not bigger
[10:32:19] <rddd> =/
[10:32:27] <taplar> amen father
[10:33:12] <new-to-json> So basically, I'm trying to make a jeopardy board, but I want to have 3 questions that get randomly sorted for each panel (16 panels in total). I used someone's base jeopardy to get the json working but now I'm having trouble grouping Qs and having them show randomly
[10:34:28] <new-to-json> This is my first attempt at grouping a category: http://pastebin.com/uWNssFxj    ~ this is my working mock up (without grouped or randomized categories) https://plnkr.co/edit/9ek5Rn0eKKxtJQBqjDtC?p=preview
[10:35:52] <TheDude> rddd: thanx! it worked!
[10:36:02] <taplar> new-to-json:  your wanting to get a random question?
[10:36:16] <new-to-json> I would have 12 groups in total  "cat1easy, cat1medium, cat1hard" and those same groups for cat2, cat3, and cat4. And I would need those questions to get randomly added to it's corresponding section
[10:36:33] <rddd> TheDude: I think taplar's way was better ;P
[10:37:10] <TheDude> rddd: XD
[10:39:14] <taplar> new-to-json: 'added'?  what is adding the questions to your json?
[10:40:00] <taplar> a small jsfiddle demonstrating the issue could really help
[10:40:11] <new-to-json> Not added to the JSON, added to the board
[10:40:22] <new-to-json> The JSON will be a pre written list
[10:40:30] <taplar> so it's already in the object, you want to randomly get the questions then?
[10:40:46] <new-to-json> Yup, based on which category they are set in
[10:41:03] <taplar> ok, so have you ever done any random number generation before?
[10:42:41] <new-to-json> Once or twice in JS with .floor()
[10:43:08] <taplar> ok, so there are a couple ways you can do it, that i know of.  one sec
[10:43:21] <rddd> if you're feeding the JSON to a PHP script, there's a lovely function called array_rand that will pick keys at random so $this_question = array_rand($questions[$this_category]);
[10:43:46] <Narb_> I'm trying to replace content in a div. by fading it out and using .html() to change the contents, but .html() always forces the element to reshow itself any ideas?
[10:44:21] <taplar> you're fading the contents that your replacing?
[10:44:35] <Narb_> ya
[10:44:39] <Narb_> and then fading back in
[10:44:41] <rddd> setting .html on a hidden element shouldn't be making it visible, maybe you're replacing the hidden -- ah beat me to it
[10:44:46] <taplar> fade the parent that your doing .html() on
[10:44:55] <rddd> if you replace a hidden element with a non-hidden element
[10:45:02] <taplar> fade puts inline styles on the elements, replace wipes those out
[10:45:33] <taplar> your hiding things, destroying them, and trying to unhide the new things, :)
[10:45:41] <rddd> yea
[10:45:50] <Narb_> woah! SOLVED
[10:45:54] <Narb_> thanks all
[10:45:54] <rddd> replace children of hidden thing ;P
[10:46:51] <new-to-json> Just for clarification, here is a better example of what I'm trying to do. each square on the jeperody board will be generated from a group of 3, so users won't always have the same boards. http://imgur.com/a/t9ZUf
[10:47:11] <taplar> pictures don't really help much
[10:48:31] <new-to-json> Do you kind of get what I mean though? Each cat has 4 difficulties, each difficulty has 3 different possible questions that could get brought in from JSON?
[10:49:42] <TheDude> is it possible set a sort of animation/trasition of  a .prop() method?
[10:49:55] <taplar> prop doesn't do animations
[10:51:55] <TheDude> The idea was to decelerate the speed of property changing
[10:52:34] <taplar> that doesn't really make sense
[10:52:36] <TheDude> but I think that is not possible (or with this method at least)
[10:52:44] <taplar> a property is like a variable on an object
[10:52:53] <taplar> it doesn't change over time with prop()
[10:52:55] <taplar> it's just set
[10:53:05] <taplar> or got
[10:53:49] <taplar> if you want an animation with something then that would be a use case for either a css transition or some kind, or animate()
[10:54:23] <taplar> new-to-json: sorry it's taking me so long to get back to you.  getting side tracked with work
[10:55:22] <new-to-json> No problem man, I completely understand! I just wanna make sure i'm clear on explaoining what I'm trying to do
[10:56:03] <TheDude> The fact is that I have an animation (using jQuery UI .hide / .show)  that hide an input and show another one  in its place.
[10:57:07] <taplar> right, show() and hide() take a duration 'slow', 'fast' iirc
[10:57:33] <TheDude> and when I do the prop it go fast (a flash)
[10:58:11] <TheDude> yes, I have given 500 for the duretion
[10:58:18] <TheDude> *duration
[11:15:01] <new-to-json> Oh wait, I just realized I can group them on score, I guess all I need to know now is how I can only bring 1 (randomly chosen)
[11:21:33] <taplar> Math.floor(Math.random * 100 % questionCount)
[11:21:35] <taplar> or
[11:21:49] <taplar> (Date.now() % questionCount) + 1
[11:22:08] <taplar> might not need the +1 since the array is 0 based
[11:24:12] <new-to-json> http://pastebin.com/QHn4frMK
[11:24:22] <new-to-json> that's the function I'm using to pull it into the board
[11:25:35] <taplar> if your going to loop over them in order and randomize them, then your randomized value would need to be for where to put them.  and you'll have to check each time that that position hasn't been used before, and if it has, get another random number
[11:26:11] <taplar> or a while loop might be better
[11:27:29] <new-to-json> Can't It just see that there are 3 questions in Cat 1 with a value of 100 and randomly choose one of those?
[11:29:29] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/0xw53ncv/
[11:29:39] <taplar> oh, you only want one question?
[11:30:14] <new-to-json> Well it would be all the questions, but it would only pull 1 question for each spot
[11:30:24] <new-to-json> but all 16 spots would have 3 different possible questions
[11:31:04] <taplar> in that case you don't want to loop over the questions
[11:31:14] <taplar> you want to loop over, some how, each spot a question should be picked for
[11:31:21] <taplar> and then randomly pick a question for that spot
[11:31:23] <joaocastanho> on bootstrap how can I open a modal without delay?
[11:31:24] <joaocastanho> $(hash).modal('toggle');
[11:31:59] <taplar> have you tried 'show' ?
[11:32:38] <joaocastanho> it has some delay
[11:32:52] <joaocastanho> what I want is when page is not loaded yet, the modal open
[11:32:54] <new-to-json> Is the delay there due to a css transistion ?
[11:33:24] <joaocastanho> ah maybe because of document ready?
[11:33:39] <new-to-json> Set it's main property to .show(), so it loads on document ready
[11:33:45] <MikeD_> how do i replace: if( confirm("?") ){ .. }  with .dialog(..) ?
[11:34:00] <joaocastanho> new-to-json: where?
[11:34:52] <new-to-json> $(hash).modal.show();
[11:35:24] <joaocastanho> that doesnt work
[11:35:31] <taplar> modal('show')
[11:35:38] <taplar> or modal('display')
[11:35:40] <taplar> i forget
[11:35:58] <MikeD_> thanks for the direction
[11:36:38] <joaocastanho> display doesnt work
[11:36:57] <taplar> is this a bootstrap modal?
[11:37:05] <joaocastanho> it is
[11:37:29] <taplar> http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#modals-methods
[11:37:36] <taplar> modal('show')
[11:38:15] <taplar> MikeD_: take a look at http://jqueryui.com/dialog/#modal-confirmation
[11:38:20] <joaocastanho> yeah, but for slow internet connections it displays the same as with document.ready
[11:38:30] <joaocastanho> I want to display the modal first then the page fully loads
[11:38:49] <taplar> so put it at the top of your body and call show right after it
[11:38:50] <new-to-json> Wrap the modal inside a jquery load event in the head section of your doc?
[11:39:44] <MikeD_> yeah, that's the page i was looking at - but don't see where there would be a return value that the if() could act upon
[11:39:46] <joaocastanho> but I have bootstrap.min.js in footer :/
[11:39:58] <new-to-json> <script type="text/javascript"> $(window).load(function(){ $('#myModal').modal('show'); }); </script>
[11:40:10] <taplar> lol, hey your asking how to make it work.  and your arguing that 'that's not how i'm doing it right now'
[11:40:24] <joaocastanho> sorry taplar
[11:40:25] <taplar> new-to-json: window load would be worse that docready
[11:40:39] <taplar> doc ready fires before load
[11:40:58] <new-to-json> ^good to know!
[11:41:00] <taplar> if you want it to happen before the body fully loads, you have to put it before the body
[11:41:30] <joaocastanho> do I still need?
[11:41:30] <joaocastanho> $(document).ready(function() {
[11:41:44] <taplar> lol, not if you want it to happen before the body loads all the html
[11:41:51] <joaocastanho> sure
[11:41:53] <taplar> which is what your asking, right?
[11:41:56] <joaocastanho> yes
[11:42:08] <taplar> so just so we are clear.  you understand what doc ready and load does?
[11:43:13] <taplar> yay/nay?
[11:44:03] <joaocastanho> yay
[11:44:04] <joaocastanho> xD
[11:44:30] <taplar> k
[11:45:03] <taplar> so, tell me what they are, ^_^
[11:46:05] <joaocastanho> doc ready is for when the page is fully loaded
[11:46:17] <taplar> what do you mean by 'fully loaded'?
[11:47:11] <joaocastanho> the html and css
[11:47:35] <taplar> but there are other things, right?  so 'fully' isn't a good word, ;)
[11:47:49] <joaocastanho> exactly
[11:48:00] <taplar> ok, so what does it do?
[11:48:55] <joaocastanho> taplar I'm not sure okay xD
[11:49:06] <taplar> that's why i'm asking you dude.  this is a teaching room
[11:49:10] <taplar> and you said you knew, :)
[11:49:15] <taplar> you lied!!!! :O
[11:49:23] <joaocastanho> I know they're similar
[11:49:34] <taplar> don't be afraid to say you don't know
[11:49:41] <joaocastanho> okay :|
[11:50:30] <taplar> so there is a state that the page has where it has finished parsing the contents of the document and loaded it into the dom.
[11:50:45] <taplar> it hasn't yet loaded everything, like images and such, but the things are in the dom
[11:51:05] <taplar> it is at this point that the document ready waits for.  once it happens it will execute the callback it was given
[11:51:12] <joaocastanho> so when the code is loaded
[11:51:36] <taplar> this ensures that if you included logic before elements on the page that the logic needs, they will exist by the time that it runs
[11:52:04] <taplar> if you put your logic at the bottom of the page, you don't need the doc ready, as all the elements are above it and will already be in the dom and available
[11:52:28] <taplar> comprende?
[11:52:38] <joaocastanho> compreendo :)
[11:52:50] <taplar> load, on the other hand, is the whole shebang
[11:52:59] <taplar> dom is load, all images are retrieved, everything
[11:53:44] <joaocastanho> thanks for explaining
[11:53:48] <joaocastanho> one thing. this is not working
[11:55:32] <joaocastanho> I place the code and bootstrap.min.js before </head> tag
[12:01:15] <new-to-json> taplar, my bad, I sent you the wrong function ~_~    This is the function for the questions, the other one generates answers: http://pastebin.com/GWi8vY4M    I found this out by trying to set "return === 1" on some things
[12:02:46] <joaocastanho> ah, I have to place modal code before the js code
[12:02:47] <joaocastanho> :/
[12:03:06] <robertmaxrees> joaocastanho or use document ready.
[12:03:26] <joaocastanho> I cant use that
[12:03:36] <robertmaxrees> why not?
[12:04:38] <joaocastanho> I need the modal to open before page loads
[12:04:46] <joaocastanho> it should be the first thing to show
[12:04:59] <robertmaxrees> then you want a slightly different approach :)
[12:05:31] <robertmaxrees> make your own overlay and modal and style the page so it's open by default.
[12:07:21] <joaocastanho> But I just want to open by default when there's an hashtag on url
[12:07:40] <robertmaxrees> ah, in which case the server can't determine that.  gotcha.
[12:08:09] <joaocastanho> taplar told me to place js code after body tag
[12:08:18] <joaocastanho> I did it, but I need to modal code too
[12:08:24] <robertmaxrees> after the opening body tag you mean?
[12:08:35] <joaocastanho> yes
[12:08:39] <robertmaxrees> makes sense.
[12:08:44] <joaocastanho> it's fine right?
[12:21:16] <joaocastanho> thanks. it works now :)
[12:35:05] <joaocastanho> robertmaxrees: one question. I want to autoplay audio without any player on android? Can it be done?
[12:35:11] <joaocastanho> I've tried but it doesnt work
[12:36:10] <robertmaxrees> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11758651/autostart-html5-video-using-android-4-browser?answertab=active#tab-top
[12:36:17] <robertmaxrees> but that's really bad ux imo
[12:37:11] <joaocastanho> then how would you do it?
[12:37:35] <robertmaxrees> why are you trying to autoplay audio?
[12:38:07] <joaocastanho> it's a request
[12:38:19] <robertmaxrees> like....
[12:38:29] <robertmaxrees> there's a reason android makes it so difficult to accomplish that.
[12:38:49] <robertmaxrees> autoplaying audio when people aren't expecting it is kind of a dick move.  but that link shows you how to do it.
[12:39:03] <joaocastanho> When the user loads the page it will autoplay an audio to explain how to do something in there
[12:39:18] <taplar> like pushing a history state some people can't use the back button to leave your site, ^_^
[12:39:20] <robertmaxrees> still bad UX.
[12:39:54] <robertmaxrees> you shouldn't need to use audio to do that - in fact, lots of users won't evben have the volume up.  and those that do will freak out and close the page.
[12:41:08] <joaocastanho> right
[12:41:54] <robertmaxrees> so you're going ot have a helluva time accomplishing that.  that SO link gives you one potential way.  i'd look into something like bootstrap-tour (if you're using bootstrap) or a similar plugin.
[12:42:38] <joaocastanho> right
[12:42:43] <joaocastanho> thanks
[12:49:34] <taplar> remember the 'me so hungry' song?
[12:57:57] <taplar> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NAp9JXzLHQ lmao, i forgot the ridiculousness
[13:07:47] <new-to-json> Hey taplar, so I added a random array variable, but I don't think I'm heading in the right direction
[13:08:39] <taplar> oh?
[13:09:04] <new-to-json> https://plnkr.co/edit/9ek5Rn0eKKxtJQBqjDtC?p=preview
[13:09:39] <taplar> i'm pretty sure i said this earlier, but a small example would be more helpful
[13:09:57] <new-to-json> I'll trim it down, 1 sec
[13:10:12] <taplar> all you need is your json and some simple looping logic
[13:10:51] <taplar> 'async': false, <-- don't do this
[13:11:09] <taplar> its deprecated, and removed in 3x
[13:11:15] <taplar> and terrible ux
[13:14:16] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/2yLLgn0x/
[13:15:19] <new-to-json> Oh i was building you one in Plunkr
[13:15:48] <taplar> we be jsfiddle peeps for the most part, :)
[13:17:04] <robertmaxrees> heh
[13:17:13] <robertmaxrees> plunkr encourages massive examples.
[13:17:18] <robertmaxrees> which is bad.
[13:17:24] <taplar> *for us
[13:17:26] <new-to-json> Okay, well I'm a little lost from there as in adding the looping logic
[13:17:36] <new-to-json> sorry!
[13:17:37] <taplar> so state the problem
[13:17:45] <taplar> what do you want?
[13:17:59] <new-to-json> So in my JSON right?
[13:18:11] <new-to-json> each object has a category and value, right?
[13:18:17] <taplar> regardless of the json, what do you want
[13:18:24] <taplar> with this json, i want to....
[13:19:11] <taplar> for each category in the json, i want to...
[13:19:15] <taplar> etc
[13:19:27] <new-to-json> With this json, I want to store 3 possible questions for each level of difficulty and category. (ie: cat 1 easy/medium/hard/extreme).
[13:19:51] <taplar> so what is a level?
[13:19:54] <new-to-json> Then i want to be able to choose 1 of those randomly and input it onto the game board.
[13:19:56] <taplar> i don't see level in the json?
[13:20:08] <new-to-json> Value would be referring to level
[13:20:22] <new-to-json> higher the value = higher the difficulty/level
[13:20:34] <taplar> ok, so rephrase
[13:20:45] <taplar> for each category, for each distinct value, i want to
[13:22:12] <new-to-json> On the game board, each category will have x-amount of questions, 1 for each value. 100, 200, 300, 400, etc..
[13:22:22] <taplar> no no, in context of the json, :)
[13:22:33] <taplar> lol
[13:22:33] <taplar> state the problem dude
[13:22:53] <new-to-json> In the JSON, there will be 3 questions related to each categories value, I want to randomly pull 1 of them
[13:22:59] <taplar> sigh
[13:23:09] <taplar> for each category, for each distinct value, i want to ...
[13:23:18] <taplar> i'm trying to lead you to water dude
[13:23:25] <robertmaxrees> :)
[13:23:50] <new-to-json> I'm tryin' man, it's confusing to phrase it that way for me
[13:24:03] <taplar> getting your mind to think this way will help you
[13:24:08] <taplar> gotta think in steps
[13:24:11] <taplar> small steps
[13:24:21] <taplar> i got this, i need this, to get this, to get this, etc
[13:24:32] <new-to-json> for each category, for each distinct value, I want to pull a single random question into the game board?
[13:24:44] <taplar> ignore the into the game board part for now
[13:24:49] <new-to-json> ok
[13:24:52] <robertmaxrees> LOL i was literally typing that.
[13:24:56] <taplar> :D
[13:25:27] <taplar> for each category, for each distinct value, I want to pull a single random question, right?
[13:25:32] <new-to-json> Ok, so the thing I am trying to accomplish is to pull a single random question for each value in each category
[13:25:43] <taplar> distinct value
[13:25:50] <taplar> you got duplicate values in your json
[13:25:50] <new-to-json> distinct value*
[13:26:05] <taplar> (which could be modified to make this easier, but side note)
[13:26:14] <taplar> ok
[13:26:20] <new-to-json> The idea of the duped values is that they are the same difficulty
[13:26:39] <taplar> it could be modified so that each value contains a sub array containing the related questions
[13:26:45] <taplar> to make the logic a bit easier
[13:27:15] <taplar> if that would be a quick change it would be benificial, otherwise we can roll with this
[13:27:33] <new-to-json> I can change the array, especially if it would make it easier
[13:29:14] <taplar> one sec and i'll modify one piece of this json to show what i mean
[13:29:31] <new-to-json> Would I still be able to seperate them via category?
[13:31:01] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/2yLLgn0x/1/
[13:32:01] <new-to-json> Ah I see
[13:32:10] <taplar> if your going to call them 'levels' you might want to also change 'value' to 'level' for consistency
[13:32:15] <new-to-json> so each time I change value, I'll have to dupe that part
[13:32:36] <new-to-json> No I can refer to them as value, since that's techniically what they are
[13:32:39] <taplar> values is an array of objects, which each have a value property and a list of questions
[13:33:08] <taplar> so your not duping the value part and you don't have to find their distinct values
[13:33:27] <new-to-json> So to make sure I'm following: I have an array of "Category" and that has a sub array of "value" ?
[13:34:03] <taplar> an array of categories.  each category has an array of values.  each value has a value property and an array of questions
[13:35:16] <new-to-json> did you only change the value: 100  array?
[13:36:09] <taplar> yep
[13:36:16] <taplar> only the value 100 ones
[13:36:17] <new-to-json> Ok, just making sure
[13:36:35] <new-to-json> let me add 2 questions to the value 200, and i'll send it back to you
[13:38:44] <new-to-json> https://jsfiddle.net/2yLLgn0x/2/
[13:38:53] <new-to-json> did I add that correctly?
[13:39:55] <taplar> no you have it at the wrong level
[13:39:55] <taplar> and your missing at least one comma
[13:39:55] <taplar> one sec
[13:41:31] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/2yLLgn0x/3/
[13:42:10] <new-to-json> ah, I put it 1 level too soon
[13:43:04] <taplar> just in case you're not aware of it, if you put your cursor right next to a {} or [] jsfiddle, it will highlight the other one it is paired with, so you can see the encapsulation
[13:43:27] <new-to-json> Oh that's awesome, I've never used fiddle, only plunker
[13:43:38] <taplar> well, not highlight.  it kinda underlines them
[13:44:02] <new-to-json> yeah I see that haha
[13:45:25] <new-to-json> So what would be our next step?
[13:45:46] <taplar> make the rest of it match the syntax and then we can start evaluating our problem
[13:46:09] <new-to-json> Can we just use those 4 for the example?
[13:46:12] <new-to-json> then print 2?
[13:46:13] <taplar> sure
[13:46:21] <new-to-json> or I can make 1 to make sure i put it in the right spot
[13:47:09] <new-to-json> https://jsfiddle.net/2yLLgn0x/4/
[13:47:19] <new-to-json> okay, we should be printing 3 questions then
[13:47:37] <taplar> you broke the json again bro
[13:48:00] <new-to-json> how? :O
[13:48:19] <taplar> you got 'values' objects inside 'values' objects
[13:48:24] <taplar> look at the encapsulation
[13:49:26] <taplar> categories[0].values[0].questions[0].answers[0].text
[13:50:55] <new-to-json> is it because it didn't end with '}];' ?
[13:51:11] <taplar> ln 35-37
[13:51:38] <taplar> your putting a values array inside an object which is inside a values array
[13:52:06] <new-to-json> so I need to move it down 1 level?
[13:52:13] <new-to-json> err.. up 1 level
[13:52:40] <taplar> values is an array of objects.  each one of those objects has a value and an array of questions
[13:52:49] <taplar> so how do you fix that?
[13:54:04] <new-to-json> https://jsfiddle.net/2yLLgn0x/5/
[13:54:06] <new-to-json> like this?
[13:54:50] <taplar> look at line 37
[13:55:26] <taplar> actually, on line 36 put your cursor next to the first }
[13:55:39] <taplar> and find the matching {
[13:56:11] <taplar> take a look at the structure of all that is inbetween those two
[13:56:17] <new-to-json> on "values": [{
[13:56:29] <taplar> right
[13:56:38] <taplar> that { goes with the } on ln 36
[13:56:51] <taplar> look at the structure in between those two
[13:56:51] <new-to-json> Yeah, they all go to "values
[13:57:01] <taplar> they are inside values, yes
[13:57:05] <new-to-json> Yeah, they all go to "values": [{
[13:57:20] <taplar> ok, so now go back to line 36 and put your cursor on the {
[13:57:36] <new-to-json> it's red
[13:57:38] <taplar> and look at what's in between it and it's matching }.  does the structure look the same as the previous one?
[13:57:58] <taplar> red means there is not a matching pair
[13:58:07] <taplar> which is another issue, but ignore that for now
[13:58:08] <new-to-json> so remove them?
[13:58:13] <taplar> no dude
[13:58:18] <taplar> look at what follows that {
[13:58:26] <taplar> does it match the structure of your first {} ?
[13:59:30] <new-to-json> Ah I see I needed another }]
[13:59:35] <taplar> ....no
[13:59:48] <new-to-json> Yea? now they are all green?
[14:00:06] <taplar> no dude
[14:00:16] <taplar> you're not answering about if the structure is the same
[14:00:20] <taplar> (cause it's not)
[14:01:31] <taplar> let me change it a bit and maybe it will be a little easier to see
[14:01:40] <new-to-json> alright
[14:03:30] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/2yLLgn0x/7/
[14:04:29] <new-to-json> Do I need to include category again?
[14:04:33] <taplar> so the first value in the values array is from line 5 to line 44
[14:04:44] <taplar> no dude, we're nesting things
[14:04:49] <taplar> you get that right?
[14:04:53] <new-to-json> Ok yeah
[14:04:54] <robertmaxrees> baby steps.
[14:05:17] <taplar> so ln 5 to ln 44 is the first value in the values array
[14:05:28] <taplar> how does it compare to the next value your trying to put in there?
[14:06:39] <new-to-json> OH, I listed "values": [{ }]   in my value array
[14:06:48] <taplar> yuuuuup
[14:07:00] <taplar> your already in the values array.  your creating a value object
[14:07:18] <new-to-json> https://jsfiddle.net/2yLLgn0x/8/
[14:07:40] <taplar> boom
[14:07:47] <new-to-json> YES haha
[14:08:05] <taplar> except your not terminating the object correctly
[14:08:23] <taplar> go to the very end and put your cursor on the ] then find the matching [ up top
[14:08:37] <new-to-json> I need one more?
[14:08:46] <taplar> take a look and you tell me
[14:08:47] <new-to-json> Do i need the ';' to terminate in JSON?
[14:09:11] <taplar> every { needs a } and every [ needs a ], in the opposite order they were opened
[14:09:33] <taplar> { { [ { [ ] } ] } }
[14:09:34] <new-to-json> I see the top 2 don't have closing ones
[14:09:39] <taplar> so.... ?
[14:09:58] <new-to-json> so I need to remove the ';' and add }];
[14:10:06] <taplar> go for it
[14:10:19] <new-to-json> https://jsfiddle.net/2yLLgn0x/10/
[14:10:49] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/2yLLgn0x/11/ :)
[14:11:24] <new-to-json> just an indenting change correct?
[14:11:27] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/2yLLgn0x/12/ and lets name the sucker
[14:11:31] <taplar> yeah i ran tidy on it
[14:11:41] <taplar> it reformats it
[14:12:00] <taplar> so now if you console.log( categories ); you should be able to see the object in your console
[14:12:00] <new-to-json> Ah i see, alright so now we have the array named as well
[14:12:31] <new-to-json> Yup I see them
[14:12:34] <z1haze_work> is there a done callback for $.each?
[14:12:41] <new-to-json> with all of the drop downs
[14:12:54] <taplar> new-to-json: alright! :)  so now we get to move on to the problem
[14:13:23] <new-to-json> So the problem is to randomly pull 1 question for each value
[14:13:26] <taplar> "for each category, for each distinct value, I want to pull a single random question"
[14:13:48] <new-to-json> For each category, for each distinct value, I want to pull a single random question
[14:13:49] <taplar> we don't have to worry about distinct value now because they are only there once per category so that's taken care of for us
[14:13:58] <taplar> so "for each category, for each value, I want to pull a single random question"
[14:14:11] <new-to-json> Alright! :D
[14:14:28] <taplar> ok, so with the problem stated like that, what are your thoughts?
[14:14:33] <shoky_> z1haze_work: no, it's not needed, $.each is not async
[14:15:21] <z1haze_work> oh cool
[14:15:37] <z1haze_work> so if i put stuff after it it wont run until the each is finished?
[14:15:42] <robertmaxrees> correct.
[14:15:46] <z1haze_work> nice thanks
[14:18:16] <new-to-json> Sorry didn't see your message taplar
[14:18:22] <taplar> ok, so with the problem stated like that, what are your thoughts?
[14:18:50] <new-to-json> So i need to loop through my categories array
[14:18:59] <taplar> how do you do that?
[14:19:12] <new-to-json> $.each(); ?
[14:19:19] <taplar> you don't need jquery for this really
[14:19:35] <taplar> try a quick google, javascript, how to iterate over an array
[14:20:04] <new-to-json> for loop?
[14:20:26] <taplar> that's one way, is there another?
[14:20:31] <robertmaxrees> ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
[14:21:00] <new-to-json> forEach
[14:21:11] <taplar> boom
[14:21:27] <taplar> so try to use forEach in that fiddle to try to console log each category
[14:21:30] <z1haze_work> how is myData undefined? http://dpaste.com/3FBG7RA
[14:21:50] <new-to-json> categories.forEach(function(values){  });  ?
[14:21:58] <taplar> in the fiddle man, ;)
[14:21:59] <robertmaxrees> z1haze_work because you have a post in that each.
[14:22:00] <robertmaxrees> lol
[14:22:10] <z1haze_work> so?
[14:22:10] <robertmaxrees> z1haze_work $.post is async, $.each is not.
[14:22:17] <new-to-json> https://jsfiddle.net/2yLLgn0x/13/
[14:22:20] <z1haze_work> well shit
[14:22:24] <robertmaxrees> so you're firing a bunch of async posts but not waiting for them to finish.
[14:22:28] <z1haze_work> back to needing that .done() then
[14:22:31] <robertmaxrees> there's an ultra easy fix.
[14:22:34] <robertmaxrees> *.then
[14:22:44] <z1haze_work> after the .each/
[14:22:45] <z1haze_work> ?
[14:22:50] <robertmaxrees> no.
[14:22:52] <taplar> new-to-json: i don't see the categories printed in the console
[14:23:10] <robertmaxrees> you can pass an array of deferreds to .when() - i'll show you how since it can be a little confusing z1haze_work
[14:23:22] <z1haze_work> cool thanks
[14:23:46] <new-to-json> It's printing the whole object
[14:23:54] <taplar> which is the line above the forEach
[14:24:04] <taplar> i want to see the forEach print each category
[14:24:54] <new-to-json> https://jsfiddle.net/2yLLgn0x/14/
[14:25:02] <new-to-json> it prints the object again?
[14:25:42] <taplar> no, that's weird.  i'm not sure why name is even valid there
[14:25:55] <new-to-json> we use name above?
[14:26:10] <taplar> no all we have above is categories on the global scope
[14:26:13] <taplar> that's weird
[14:26:17] <new-to-json> "name": "category1"
[14:26:28] <taplar> that's a property of the object some where
[14:26:35] <taplar> not a straight up global variable
[14:26:45] <new-to-json> oh i see
[14:26:51] <taplar> take a look at the forEach documentation again that you found
[14:27:27] <robertmaxrees> z1haze_work https://bpaste.net/show/5f7eaec052cc
[14:27:29] <robertmaxrees> something like this.
[14:27:33] <robertmaxrees> that'll probably need some tweaking.
[14:28:49] <new-to-json> Am I trying to display the questions?
[14:29:00] <taplar> no, just each category
[14:29:10] <taplar> each object inside categories
[14:30:18] <z1haze_work> thank you
[14:30:19] <z1haze_work> definitely confusing
[14:30:30] <robertmaxrees> z1haze_work basically, you're making an array of deferreds.
[14:30:38] <new-to-json> I'm not sure the foreach docs are helping me out here :/
[14:31:11] <taplar> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/forEach
[14:31:16] <robertmaxrees> z1haze_work $.when.apply() hands all of them to .when(), which then in turn lets you register a single handler when ALL those ajax calls have finished.
[14:31:36] <z1haze_work> what is console.log(arguments);
[14:32:08] <z1haze_work> i notice you have minicart.show(myData); outside of any of those
[14:32:09] <robertmaxrees> basically, arguments is a special object in functions that represents all the parameters passed to it.  you'll need that to access all the return values.
[14:32:18] <z1haze_work> does that mean the above code will wait until its finished before continuing?
[14:32:18] <robertmaxrees> z1haze_work oh yeah ignore that part.
[14:32:22] <robertmaxrees> no.
[14:32:33] <z1haze_work> where will i exccute? minicart.show(myData); inside the $.when?
[14:32:34] <robertmaxrees> that was a mistake.  all code that relies on the return will need to be inside that .then() call.
[14:32:44] <new-to-json> I keep returning result :c
[14:33:59] <totallyserious> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/40161999/exit-pop-dialog-pop-only-when-its-closing-intentional hey anyone can provide some feedbacK?
[14:34:09] <taplar> well your passing in 'values' to the function, but your using name inside it.  idk why you did that
[14:34:58] <taplar> when you use forEach() the first parameter you take into the function you give it will be each element in the array
[14:35:06] <taplar> as the docs would be telling you
[14:35:15] <taplar> and examples showing you, ;)
[14:35:32] <z1haze_work> robertmaxrees: http://dpaste.com/200PSKR
[14:35:49] <new-to-json> https://jsfiddle.net/2yLLgn0x/15/
[14:35:50] <new-to-json> ?
[14:35:57] <robertmaxrees> z1haze_work just sending me a link doesn't accomplish anything.  did you have a question?
[14:36:10] <robertmaxrees> ....
[14:36:13] <z1haze_work> sorry, just asking if thats where id do it
[14:36:14] <taplar> new-to-json: what do you see in the console?
[14:36:16] <robertmaxrees> that's not at all what i recommended.
[14:36:16] <z1haze_work> inside the $.wehn
[14:36:20] <robertmaxrees> ...........................
[14:36:28] <new-to-json> Object {name: "category1", values: Array[3]}
[14:36:29] <robertmaxrees> why did you completely chjange what I had?
[14:36:32] <taplar> :)
[14:36:39] <z1haze_work> i didnt
[14:36:43] <robertmaxrees> myData = data won't work here, either.
[14:36:56] <new-to-json> taplar is that correct?
[14:37:05] <z1haze_work> in your example where is the data response from the server
[14:37:06] <taplar> you tell me :)
[14:37:13] <taplar> is that the category?
[14:37:14] <new-to-json> it shows the category name? :D
[14:37:25] <robertmaxrees> z1haze_work the arguments object will have all of that.
[14:37:43] <taplar> yes, you're printing the category object
[14:37:44] <robertmaxrees> z1haze_work do you care when the ALL finish, or when each individual one finishes?
[14:38:08] <taplar> now before we go further one thing to point out
[14:38:34] <taplar> your iterating over categories and your printing the category object, but the variable name is 'name'
[14:38:36] <goddard> how do i append a large block of HTML?
[14:38:40] <z1haze_work> my issue is this: each time time the post runs, it returns the full cart data, but sometimes when i execture show on things such as product sets that add 3 products at a time, one of the show() calls fails, so i only want to store the LAST server response and then call minicart.show
[14:38:53] <z1haze_work> i care when they all are finished and i only want the data from the last one
[14:39:05] <robertmaxrees> z1haze_work that's... really odd.
[14:39:07] <taplar> goddard: use some form of a template
[14:39:11] <z1haze_work> what is odd about it
[14:39:17] <taplar> don't stick your markup in your logic
[14:39:18] <robertmaxrees> z1haze_work you need to fix your frontend to only submit once then.
[14:39:25] <z1haze_work> ?
[14:39:32] <z1haze_work> it has to add each item
[14:39:50] <robertmaxrees> z1haze_work you could do that in a single ajax call.
[14:40:00] <z1haze_work> im not reworking the api
[14:40:06] <new-to-json> Should I swap my variable name?
[14:40:07] <z1haze_work> this is a get it done task
[14:40:25] <robertmaxrees> z1haze_work then good luck :) i gave you the rough idea.  you'll need to figure out the rest from there.
[14:40:27] <taplar> new-to-json: how does 'name' tell you or relate to what it actually contains?
[14:40:32] <taplar> a/contains/is
[14:40:35] <z1haze_work> we dont even officially support multiple product set stuff
[14:40:56] <robertmaxrees> i'm familiar with demandware.  shit's expensive.
[14:41:04] <new-to-json> Name contains the specific category's questions
[14:41:19] <taplar> new-to-json: but that's not what the object is.
[14:41:25] <taplar> it may contain that, but it is not that
[14:41:37] <new-to-json> the object is categories?
[14:41:49] <taplar> would it make sense to do people.forEach(function(spaceship){   })
[14:41:50] <taplar> ?
[14:42:37] <new-to-json> no because thats 2 seperate things?
[14:42:47] <taplar> right.  the name doesn't tell you what it 'is'
[14:43:03] <taplar> so what about your case
[14:43:36] <new-to-json> categories.forEach(function(question){ console.log(name); )}; ?
[14:43:43] <taplar> what is categories?
[14:43:55] <new-to-json> the whole array
[14:43:59] <taplar> of what?
[14:44:04] <new-to-json> questions
[14:44:07] <taplar> really?
[14:44:23] <z1haze_work> ok so robertmaxrees it returns an array of objects that just says success
[14:44:28] <new-to-json> objects?
[14:44:30] <z1haze_work> where is the actual data returned from the server
[14:44:39] <taplar> lol, look at the json dude
[14:44:41] <robertmaxrees> z1haze_work the arguments object, which has a set of indexes.
[14:44:44] <taplar> yes objects
[14:44:44] <z1haze_work> console.log(arguments[arguments.length-1]);
[14:44:52] <taplar> what do the objects represent?
[14:44:54] <z1haze_work> that would be the last response, right?
[14:44:56] <robertmaxrees> you can read more on mdn
[14:45:05] <new-to-json> values?
[14:45:06] <z1haze_work> so much for 'super simple' or whatever you said
[14:45:13] <robertmaxrees> super simple
[14:45:16] <robertmaxrees> ?
[14:45:20] <taplar> it's not a trick question man
[14:45:36] <taplar> the variable your iterating over is even plural
[14:45:44] <z1haze_work> robertmaxrees
[14:45:44] <z1haze_work> there's an ultra easy fix.
[14:45:52] <new-to-json> categories
[14:46:00] <taplar> is the array
[14:46:01] <z1haze_work> this is stupid convoluted
[14:46:15] <taplar> so each object in it is a...
[14:46:15] <new-to-json> ok, categories is the array
[14:46:25] <new-to-json> name is the object?
[14:46:25] <z1haze_work> i just want the data that is returned from the server
[14:46:32] <taplar> dude, seriously?
[14:46:43] <robertmaxrees> z1haze_work oh ok. good luck then.
[14:46:57] <z1haze_work> so you want to give me code to use and then no have me unerstand how it works
[14:47:00] <new-to-json> I don't think this way man, shits mad confusing to keep track of
[14:47:02] <robertmaxrees> z1haze_work ....
[14:47:04] <taplar> if i have an array called 'employees', what would you think each object inside it is?
[14:47:12] <new-to-json> an employee
[14:47:14] <taplar> yes
[14:47:17] <robertmaxrees> i tried to explain it and work with you, then you complained and protested and got weird about it.
[14:47:22] <taplar> so you have an array of categories
[14:47:24] <z1haze_work> i asked you a simple question on how to ge tthe data back from the server
[14:47:30] <new-to-json> Category
[14:47:33] <robertmaxrees> and i showed you how to do that.
[14:47:33] <taplar> yes!
[14:47:35] <taplar> lol
[14:47:36] <z1haze_work> well you tend to get condescending
[14:47:36] <robertmaxrees> and explained it to you.
[14:47:41] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[14:47:46] <robertmaxrees> you're the one copping an attitude :)
[14:47:50] <taplar> so what your passing in is not really a 'name' but...
[14:47:54] <z1haze_work> and what are the '....'
[14:47:57] <robertmaxrees> you're frustrated - that's fine.  don't target that at me.
[14:48:03] <taplar> ... <- fill in the blanks
[14:48:10] <new-to-json> category!
[14:48:14] <z1haze_work> no in that case
[14:48:14] <taplar> boom, do it
[14:48:18] <robertmaxrees> yes in that case.
[14:48:27] <robertmaxrees> i tfeels like you weren't reading what i was saying
[14:48:41] <robertmaxrees> if you have a problem with me, you're more than welcome to PM me.
[14:48:42] <z1haze_work> maybe confused it
[14:48:48] <new-to-json> https://jsfiddle.net/2yLLgn0x/16/
[14:48:54] <z1haze_work> i dont have a problem with anyone
[14:49:00] <robertmaxrees> but i tried to explain it.  i gave you an example.  you completely changed it and then asked why it doesn't work.
[14:49:05] <robertmaxrees> i don't know how else to help.
[14:49:08] <z1haze_work> not intentionally.
[14:49:19] <taplar> new-to-json: alright, so now we have a category which will be each category in turn
[14:49:30] <z1haze_work> robertmaxrees: is this closer to your code https://bpaste.net/show/573fc8396ddc
[14:49:35] <new-to-json> alright, i'm following
[14:49:47] <robertmaxrees> z1haze_work why do you keep changing it back to post?
[14:49:52] <taplar> new-to-json: so now, go back to the problem statement
[14:49:57] <z1haze_work> because im making a post request
[14:50:00] <robertmaxrees> and no - you're missing the currentCall.id changes
[14:50:01] <z1haze_work> i thought it was just shorthand
[14:50:19] <z1haze_work> is $.post not the same as $.ajax ?
[14:50:47] <robertmaxrees> feel free to use it.
[14:51:04] <robertmaxrees> but you're ignoring the fact that you're now using that.id
[14:51:04] <new-to-json> I want to pull a single value of each category at random
[14:51:07] <robertmaxrees> not currentCall.id
[14:51:24] <z1haze_work> yea i fixed
[14:51:29] <z1haze_work> that was my mistake
[14:51:30] <new-to-json> for each category, for each value, I want to pull a single random question  *
[14:51:38] <taplar> so what part did we just do?
[14:51:46] <z1haze_work> return $.post('/on/demandware.store/Sites-MJB-Site/default/Vue-AddProduct?pid=' + currentCall.ID + '&quantity=' + $('input[name=Quantity]').val());
[14:51:49] <new-to-json> for each category
[14:51:56] <new-to-json> pulled each category
[14:52:00] <z1haze_work> but i still just get some object back and not the data id normally get
[14:52:03] <taplar> ok, so next
[14:53:04] <taplar> what do we want to do?
[14:53:16] <new-to-json> I need to pull a single value from each category
[14:53:22] <z1haze_work> arguments[arguments.length-1][0]
[14:53:28] <robertmaxrees> z1haze_work have you tried reading the docs?
[14:53:33] <new-to-json> or, pull all the values from each category
[14:53:45] <taplar> for each category, for each value, I want to pull a single random question <--- we did the first part
[14:53:52] <z1haze_work> i would but im not sure what im reading them for
[14:53:57] <z1haze_work> $.when? $.apply?
[14:54:00] <robertmaxrees> check the docs for .when
[14:54:06] <new-to-json> I have to define the values in my foreach?
[14:54:08] <robertmaxrees> .apply is a native js thing.
[14:54:20] <taplar> each category has values, right?
[14:54:25] <new-to-json> yes
[14:54:32] <taplar> "for each value"
[14:54:46] <new-to-json> I have to loop through category
[14:54:53] <taplar> the values of the category
[14:54:57] <taplar> yep
[14:55:00] <new-to-json> ok
[14:55:50] <taplar> just in case, before you get started, are you familiar with dot notation?
[14:56:57] <new-to-json> I am not
[14:57:01] <taplar> k
[14:57:32] <taplar> var person = { firstName: 'joe', lastName: 'brown' };  to reference the inner properties you can use dot notation like: person.firstName
[14:57:51] <new-to-json> Oh ok ya, I understand OOP
[14:57:52] <taplar> or array notation like person[ 'firstName' ]
[14:58:04] <taplar> that's not oop
[14:58:11] <taplar> heh, that's just property access
[14:58:21] <new-to-json> Oh well anyways, i know what you mean
[14:58:32] <new-to-json> I never heard of it referenced at dot notation
[14:58:42] <taplar> '.' is a dot, ;)
[14:58:53] <new-to-json> it makes sense :p
[14:59:00] <taplar> or i guess period notation, but i never hear it phrased like that
[14:59:05] <new-to-json> so should I write this forEach?
[14:59:30] <taplar> i'm not gonna, :P
[14:59:40] <new-to-json> https://jsfiddle.net/2yLLgn0x/17/
[14:59:54] <new-to-json> oh wait, values is undefined
[15:00:06] <taplar> values.forEach <-- where did values come from?
[15:00:18] <taplar> lol, i just talked about dot notation *sings* for a reason
[15:01:14] <new-to-json> I would have to refencer it as value.questions ?
[15:01:23] <taplar> value is undefined
[15:01:28] <taplar> values is undefined
[15:01:30] <taplar> what is defined?
[15:01:39] <new-to-json> category
[15:01:45] <taplar> boom
[15:02:39] <new-to-json> category.forEach is not a function
[15:02:49] <taplar> nope, category isn't an array
[15:02:50] <new-to-json> category.values ?
[15:02:54] <taplar> boom
[15:03:10] <taplar> no need for the '?'  what's the uncertainty?
[15:03:25] <new-to-json> https://jsfiddle.net/2yLLgn0x/18/
[15:03:37] <new-to-json> JSON is confusing haha
[15:03:58] <taplar> you have both the json up above, and your console logging the category
[15:03:59] <robertmaxrees> not at all.
[15:04:06] <taplar> that print shows what is inside that object
[15:04:21] <taplar> it has a values key, right?
[15:04:32] <introspectr3> can someone please help me with unbinding an even handler? https://dpaste.de/Ra3W line 14 isn't doing it
[15:04:51] <new-to-json> I'm console.logging   (value). I should be logging category.value
[15:04:57] <new-to-json> .values*
[15:05:19] <taplar> ln 109 your logging the category
[15:05:20] <new-to-json> wait maybe not
[15:05:28] <new-to-json> yes
[15:05:32] <robertmaxrees> introspectr3 jquery and native js events don't really mesh like that.
[15:05:34] <taplar> so you can see what it in it in the console
[15:05:42] <taplar> *what is
[15:05:49] <new-to-json> yes
[15:05:55] <taplar> and you see 'values', yes?
[15:06:08] <new-to-json> yup
[15:06:16] <taplar> so nothing to be uncertain about, :)
[15:06:33] <robertmaxrees> introspectr3 also, you'd want $('.select').off('onchange'), but might I ask why you're unbinding that handler in the first place?
[15:06:58] <introspectr3> magento builds the pager automatically, im trying to customize it :)
[15:07:09] <introspectr3> got it to work though with .attr(), thanks for help
[15:07:12] <robertmaxrees> D:
[15:07:25] <robertmaxrees> i might rethink that strategy, but ok.
[15:07:40] <souravbadami> Hey! I'm setting the value of a select box using PHP as array() and then dynamically adding some data via jquery. Then trying to access it using PHP and I'm getting Trying to get property of a non-object. Where am I going wrong ?
[15:07:44] <taplar> wait, what?
[15:07:53] <taplar> removing an on element binding?
[15:08:04] <new-to-json> I have 3 objects aswell
[15:08:13] <robertmaxrees> souravbadami are you trying to access the js data in php or...?
[15:08:17] <robertmaxrees> because you can't really do that.
[15:08:45] <souravbadami> Yes, I mean initially the selectbox was empty. Then I populated the data via JS. Now I want to access it via PHP.
[15:09:01] <robertmaxrees> souravbadami you can't really do that without sending the data back to the server.
[15:09:02] <taplar> new-to-json: have you updated the fiddle to console log each value now?
[15:09:14] <robertmaxrees> souravbadami php just shoots out a page to the browser.  after that happens, it knows nothing.
[15:09:14] <new-to-json> https://jsfiddle.net/2yLLgn0x/19/
[15:09:35] <souravbadami> But, the text field's data is fetched nicely. ?
[15:09:36] <taplar> sweet
[15:09:44] <robertmaxrees> souravbadami huh?
[15:09:49] <robertmaxrees> souravbadami how are you sending data back to the php?
[15:09:56] <robertmaxrees> are you posting a form or using ajax?
[15:10:02] <taplar> new-to-json: so now you have 2/3 parts of your problem done, :)
[15:10:22] <new-to-json> party party party
[15:10:27] <new-to-json> now we have to randomize it
[15:10:29] <souravbadami> Getting the data into the selectBox via ajax and then posting the form. I'm using nette framework.
[15:10:41] <robertmaxrees> okay, so then it sounds like the post doesn';t contain the data.
[15:10:46] <new-to-json> or did i skip a step?
[15:10:53] <taplar> nope, your good
[15:10:57] <robertmaxrees> souravbadami check the network tab of your dev tools for the request and check its body.
[15:11:01] <robertmaxrees> make sure it's got what you think it does.
[15:11:02] <souravbadami> Something like, $form->getValues()->listValue ?
[15:11:04] <new-to-json> ok, so now to randomize it
[15:11:25] <souravbadami> $form->getValues()->searchValue gives correct data.
[15:11:29] <robertmaxrees> souravbadami i don't know PHP - but this would be in the developer tools in your browser.
[15:11:48] <taplar> brb
[15:11:54] <souravbadami> Umm, Okay. I'll take a look.
[15:12:04] <new-to-json> taplar, brb restroom break
[15:14:34] <taplar> lol, we're in sync
[15:15:16] <new-to-json> taplar, just got back, ready when you are
[15:15:58] <taplar> yup, so now time to figure out the randomizing.  i think i mentioned a couple approaches earlier, or a quick google could give you some ideas
[15:16:47] <new-to-json> could we do it with shuffle?
[15:17:01] <taplar> your really not wanting to randomize the questions
[15:17:08] <taplar> you said you only want one, right?
[15:17:16] <taplar> so really you just want to randomly pick on
[15:17:18] <taplar> e
[15:17:19] <new-to-json> yes, 1 out of the 3, randomly
[15:17:55] <taplar> yup, so your not shuffling the deck and taking the first card
[15:18:00] <taplar> your just picking one randomly from some where in the middle
[15:18:03] <taplar> as an analogy
[15:18:11] <new-to-json> yes
[15:18:17] <new-to-json> oh i see how that wouldn't work
[15:18:29] <new-to-json> so i need Math.random();
[15:18:45] <taplar> or Date.now().  i like it better myself
[15:18:54] <new-to-json> ok we can use date now
[15:19:11] <taplar> it's already an int so you don't have to do * 100 and floor
[15:19:27] <new-to-json> ok
[15:20:11] <new-to-json> so this would be within my value function, correct?
[15:20:23] <taplar> yep, cause the value has the questions
[15:20:38] <taplar> and you said you wanted to do it for each one of the values
[15:20:47] <new-to-json> yes
[15:21:24] <new-to-json> so I don't quite understand how you randomize with date now
[15:21:32] <taplar> so, what are your thoughts?
[15:21:46] <taplar> Date.now() gives you a long value for the current time
[15:21:55] <new-to-json> so it returns a timestamp?
[15:22:03] <new-to-json> unix time stamp?
[15:22:08] <taplar> so the randomness comes from just the randomness of when it is executed
[15:22:14] <taplar> it's some epoch, idk
[15:22:20] <taplar> it's relative to what the user's machine uses
[15:22:44] <new-to-json> okay, so i need a new function for it
[15:22:45] <taplar> not a timestamp, a long value
[15:23:13] <new-to-json> Date.now = function now() {    };  will set it up for the current time?
[15:23:23] <taplar> no, Date now already exists
[15:23:32] <taplar> var currentTimeInMilliseconds = Date.now();
[15:23:56] <new-to-json> Do i need to set the var, or is it preset in js?
[15:24:10] <taplar> you always want to 'var' your variables at some point to scope them down
[15:24:17] <new-to-json> ok
[15:24:29] <taplar> or with ES6 you'd use 'let', but that's a side note
[15:25:23] <taplar> so Date.now() will give you a long value of the datetime, which will look like 1837083287 or something
[15:25:38] <taplar> which most certainly exceeds the bounds of your questions array, :)
[15:26:04] <new-to-json> Alright, so I'm gonna have set that < my values.length"?
[15:26:11] <taplar> yep
[15:26:30] <taplar> which i was doing earlier if you remember what i did
[15:26:36] <benlieb> how can I check if an element has a specific event handler (method)?
[15:27:27] <taplar> benlieb: productionally?  you wouldn't
[15:27:48] <new-to-json> do I need a while loop?
[15:27:57] <benlieb> taplar: I kinda need to
[15:28:02] <taplar> new-to-json: what would you use a while loop for?
[15:28:16] <taplar> benlieb: you should know when/if your logic is binding event handlers to it
[15:28:32] <new-to-json> I guess I wouldn't need one
[15:28:54] <benlieb> video events don't bubble, so any new video elements added via ajax need to get the handlers added.
[15:29:11] <taplar> so mark them with a class or something
[15:29:25] <taplar> or you know which ones you added in the ajax, only use those you added for the new binding
[15:29:55] <taplar> what your asking for is a round about solution for a self imposed problem
[15:30:06] <new-to-json> https://jsfiddle.net/2yLLgn0x/20/
[15:30:22] <benlieb> taplar: oh boy
[15:30:32] <taplar> just being honest
[15:31:35] <taplar> new-to-json: ln 116 doesn't make sense.  value isn't an array and it most certainly is less than whatever the date will be
[15:32:34] <benlieb> taplar: I hear you. And I hear your opinion. I encourage you to consider that distinguishing opinion from fact creates better relationships, and better projects.
[15:32:40] <taplar> benlieb: if your ajax is creating elements that need bindings added to them, at the point that you are adding them to the dom, you know what they are.  there isn't a need to look them up.  you just bind to them.
[15:32:48] <taplar> it's not an opinion
[15:33:20] <taplar> if someone disagrees with this they can easily give their opposing solution
[15:33:59] <benlieb> Either way I appreciate your input.
[15:34:08] <robertmaxrees> what's the problem?
[15:34:14] <new-to-json> https://jsfiddle.net/2yLLgn0x/21/
[15:35:04] <taplar> new-to-json: no, you don't need to reference category in there.  value has all you need
[15:35:21] <taplar> ln 111 is printing out the value.  look at what it look slike
[15:35:32] <benlieb> it seems that if .off( events [, selector ] [, handler ] ) can remove a specific handler method, there is a way to check if the handler is present.
[15:35:34] <taplar> robertmaxrees: he was wanting to see if an element had a binding on it
[15:35:42] <new-to-json> I don't need length?
[15:35:51] <taplar> you need length, but not for value
[15:35:58] <taplar> that's not your array
[15:36:01] <robertmaxrees> ah benlieb so you want to remove all handlers and then reapply them when you add new video elements?
[15:36:10] <new-to-json> category is my array
[15:36:36] <taplar> no at that point in your logic, questions is your array
[15:36:46] <taplar> your already inside a specific category
[15:37:10] <new-to-json> Oh I see, so question.length
[15:37:26] <taplar> look at your value printout in your console at it's keys
[15:37:28] <benlieb> robertmaxrees: no I just never want to add a handler twice. code is coming and going from my page via ajax, and I'd rather have handler assignment conslolidated
[15:37:59] <benlieb> the problem is that some events don't bubble, otherwise I'd use 'body element'
[15:37:59] <robertmaxrees> benlieb so generally you don't want to do it that way.  it's generally better to specifically bind the handler inside the ajax return instead.
[15:38:17] <robertmaxrees> because otherwise you're adding a bunch of convoluted overhead to fix the problem.
[15:38:59] <new-to-json> questions.value.length
[15:39:11] <taplar> questions is undefined
[15:39:28] <taplar> heh, did you look at the console like i suggested?
[15:40:05] <new-to-json> yes haha
[15:40:18] <benlieb> robertmaxrees: It doesn't seem convoluted to me. I'm using $(document).ajaxSuccess(function) to make sure all elements have the handlers they need. For me this is much simpler than adding handler management in every individual ajax call
[15:40:21] <new-to-json> questions is in the value array
[15:40:28] <taplar> value object, not array
[15:40:33] <taplar> but yes, :)
[15:40:34] <new-to-json> so value.question(s).length
[15:40:40] <taplar> yep
[15:40:43] <taplar> with the s
[15:40:46] <robertmaxrees> benlieb because you're adding an extra step you could entirely avoid.
[15:40:58] <robertmaxrees> feel free to ignore the advice of two separate people.  just seems odd.
[15:41:05] <new-to-json> https://jsfiddle.net/2yLLgn0x/23/
[15:41:30] <taplar> new-to-json: yep so now what is ln 116 doing?
[15:41:54] <new-to-json> comparing the timestamp to the number of questions in each value object
[15:42:10] <taplar> how is that helping you solve your problem?
[15:42:28] <new-to-json> it returns true
[15:42:32] <taplar> lol
[15:42:42] <taplar> right, but *points back at his question*
[15:42:59] <new-to-json> I need it to pull a random question
[15:43:14] <new-to-json> so i guess it does something with picking the random questions
[15:43:45] <taplar> you want a random number of 0 <= randomNumber < arrayLength
[15:44:13] <taplar> Date.now() gives you a really big random(ish) number
[15:44:24] <taplar> now you need to reduce it down to with in your range
[15:45:13] <new-to-json> Is that splice?
[15:45:22] <taplar> no, it's a number, not an array
[15:45:36] <new-to-json> divide?
[15:45:44] <taplar> what's another form of divide?
[15:45:59] <taplar> i did it earlier
[15:46:06] <new-to-json> % ?
[15:46:10] <taplar> yep.  what is that?
[15:46:17] <new-to-json> percentage
[15:46:23] <taplar> modulus
[15:46:35] <new-to-json> *googles modulus*
[15:46:41] <taplar> here's the difference
[15:46:45] <taplar> modulus gives you just the remainder of a division
[15:46:53] <taplar> so 5/2 = 1
[15:46:56] <taplar> err
[15:46:59] <taplar> so 5%2 = 1
[15:47:32] <taplar> so if we know that we can use it for bounds conformaty
[15:47:42] <taplar> since we know 5%4 = 4
[15:47:51] <taplar> and 5%5 = 0
[15:48:08] <taplar> if we want a number ranging from 0-22, what can we do?
[15:48:53] <new-to-json> % by 22?
[15:48:59] <new-to-json> or % from 22
[15:49:07] <taplar> 22/22 doesn't have a remainder right?
[15:49:17] <new-to-json> right
[15:49:28] <taplar> we want an equation that will give us a remainder of 0 - 22
[15:50:40] <new-to-json> date now % our questions?
[15:50:53] <taplar> :)
[15:51:08] <new-to-json> https://jsfiddle.net/2yLLgn0x/24/
[15:51:09] <taplar> what would that do?
[15:51:21] <new-to-json> always a random number
[15:51:28] <taplar> of
[15:51:29] <taplar> ?
[15:51:40] <new-to-json> 0-3?
[15:51:49] <taplar> really?
[15:51:58] <taplar> in general
[15:52:04] <taplar> what range would it give?
[15:52:10] <taplar> 0 - ?
[15:52:13] <new-to-json> 0-22
[15:52:22] <taplar> you don't have 22 questions, :)
[15:52:30] <new-to-json> thats why i said 3 hahah
[15:52:36] <taplar> you don't have 3 questions either
[15:52:40] <new-to-json> 6
[15:52:41] <taplar> i think
[15:52:52] <new-to-json> oh wait
[15:52:54] <new-to-json> no 0-2
[15:52:59] <taplar> no
[15:53:04] <taplar> yep, but no
[15:53:09] <taplar> remember we get the remainder
[15:53:20] <taplar> 2/2 has no remainder
[15:53:41] <taplar> possible remainders are 0 and 1
[15:53:51] <new-to-json> oh ok
[15:54:08] <taplar> which would be 0 - ( arraylength - 1 )
[15:54:16] <taplar> which is the bounds of your array, no?
[15:54:29] <new-to-json> yup
[15:54:35] <taplar> :), alright then
[15:56:50] <new-to-json> so do i have to compare "randomQuestion" to anything?
[15:57:11] <taplar> nope.  you got a random number within the bounds of your array, right?
[15:57:20] <new-to-json> I think so lol
[15:57:27] <taplar> you do, ;)
[15:57:50] <taplar> confidence man, confidence! :)
[15:57:53] <al_nz1> morning
[15:57:58] <taplar> yo
[15:58:02] <new-to-json> I guess I don't understand where to go from there haha
[15:58:43] <taplar> you got an array you want a random question from.  now you have a random number
[16:00:04] <taplar> key -> lock
[16:00:11] <taplar> = prize
[16:00:49] <new-to-json> hmm
[16:01:04] <new-to-json> so I have to compare that randomnumber to my returned value?
[16:01:23] <taplar> no.  how do you access specific elements in an array?
[16:02:36] <new-to-json> dot notation?
[16:02:57] <taplar> doesn't work nicely with numbers
[16:03:07] <taplar> that that's just for objects, really
[16:03:12] <taplar> you have a true blue array
[16:03:37] <new-to-json> return
[16:04:14] <taplar> huh?
[16:04:22] <new-to-json> do I have to return the value?
[16:04:33] <new-to-json> oh wait
[16:04:38] <new-to-json> i loop through the array
[16:04:48] <taplar> don't need to loop
[16:04:58] <taplar> you only want one.  a random one.  you have a random number
[16:05:07] <taplar> i mentioned array notation earlier
[16:06:40] <new-to-json> category[questions.value % randomQuestion];
[16:07:25] <taplar> questions is undefined
[16:07:35] <taplar> category is a higher scope, you don't need to reference it
[16:07:38] <taplar> i've said that before
[16:07:40] <new-to-json> value.questions.length
[16:07:56] <taplar> lol, so i take it you forgot about array notation
[16:08:15] <new-to-json> I don't remember you saying it :o
[16:08:49] <taplar> scrolled off my log
[16:09:04] <taplar> anyway, if you have an array you can access the elements by array[ n ]
[16:09:23] <taplar> where array is an array object and 'n' is a number within the bounds of it
[16:09:42] <taplar> 0 <= n < length
[16:10:42] <new-to-json> so I'm still a little lost
[16:10:56] <new-to-json> my array is questions
[16:11:12] <taplar> var someArray = [ 'a', 'b', 'c' ];  someArray[0]; someArray[1]; someArray[2];
[16:11:40] <new-to-json> questions[ n ]
[16:11:51] <taplar> value.questions
[16:12:00] <taplar> where n is a number with in the array bounds
[16:12:20] <new-to-json> do I input that number?
[16:12:33] <taplar> i just showed you with the someArray example
[16:12:45] <taplar> you just use it.  either statically or giving it a variable that contains a number
[16:13:45] <new-to-json>       var value.questions [ n ]; ?
[16:14:09] <taplar> no 'var' (for now) and you don't have an 'n' variable
[16:14:14] <taplar> you do have another variable though
[16:14:28] <new-to-json> randomQuestions
[16:14:31] <taplar> yep
[16:14:46] <taplar> which you should consider changing that variables name
[16:14:59] <new-to-json> https://jsfiddle.net/2yLLgn0x/25/
[16:15:21] <taplar> console.log that
[16:16:27] <new-to-json> https://jsfiddle.net/2yLLgn0x/26/
[16:16:29] <new-to-json> WOOOOOO
[16:16:53] <taplar> heh
[16:16:57] <taplar> congrats
[16:17:24] <new-to-json> holy hell, that was rough lol
[16:17:49] <taplar> understand it a bit more now?
[16:18:03] <new-to-json> definitely a little more clear
[16:18:18] <new-to-json> appreciate the help my man! sorry for chewing up your day haha
[16:18:44] <taplar> nah.  you got me in one of those moods where i was like "this fker is going to get it!"
[16:18:48] <taplar> :D
[16:19:10] <new-to-json> Hahaha hopefully it sticks! I'll have to revisit this tommorrow and make sure
[16:19:22] <taplar> you've joined the exclusive club of now two people
[16:22:21] <new-to-json> now to try and combine the two
[16:30:56] <taplar> one satisfied user, one angry user.  my day is balanced
[16:42:09] <new-to-json> Hey taplar
[16:42:12] <new-to-json> you still there?
[16:42:22] <taplar> yup
[16:42:56] <new-to-json> can you take a look at these vars real quick? i don;t really understand how to make them work with the new method, since I don't know some of these functions
[16:43:23] <taplar> i can't look at it much.  i need to get some stuff done in the office
[16:43:53] <new-to-json> For sure, it's just 4 small variables
[16:44:12] <new-to-json> http://pastebin.com/U1qcD0xA
[16:45:24] <taplar> what's your question about them?
[16:45:41] <new-to-json> since we changed the order of the JSON file
[16:47:16] <taplar> take a look at this guy: http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide1
[17:10:55] <jquery775> hi
[17:10:57] <jquery775> a question
[17:11:17] <jquery775> is it possible to access dom elements without using selectors in jquery ?
[17:11:28] <taplar> sure
[17:11:36] <jquery775> ok more precise
[17:11:43] <jquery775> is something like that possible
[17:12:01] <taplar> document.getElementsById, document.getElementsByClassName, document.getElementsByTagName, document.querySelector, document.querySelectorAll, etc
[17:12:05] <jquery775> <div id="ddd"> </div>
[17:12:08] <jquery775> and as js
[17:12:37] <taplar> document.getElementById('ddd'), document.querySelector('#ddd'), document.querySelectorAll('#ddd')
[17:12:41] <jquery775> $(document).ready( function () { console.log(dd); })
[17:12:42] <jquery775> ?
[17:12:51] <taplar> no you have to look it up some how
[17:13:04] <jquery775> but the problem i have is that it does work
[17:13:15] <jquery775> and now i'm trying to understand how
[17:13:30] <taplar> is that the only element with that id?
[17:13:38] <jquery775> yep
[17:13:48] <jquery775> and i can access all elements with id
[17:13:49] <taplar> it's in a document ready like you have above?
[17:13:55] <jquery775> but not with class
[17:13:59] <jquery775> yep
[17:14:15] <taplar> is the element created dynamically?
[17:14:23] <jquery775> nope
[17:14:44] <taplar> then i'd need to see it failing in a fiddle cause that would suggest that the selector is wrong
[17:15:27] <taplar> what selector are you using to try to find it?
[17:16:29] <jquery775> none
[17:16:36] <jquery775> and this is the problem
[17:16:38] <taplar> uh, you have to look it up man
[17:16:41] <taplar> lol
[17:16:48] <jquery775> again
[17:17:05] <jquery775> html has simple div with id="ddd"
[17:17:14] <jquery775> and in js i have something like that
[17:17:27] <taplar> ?
[17:17:55] <jquery775> $(document).ready( function () { console.log(ddd) })
[17:17:57] <jquery775> nothing more
[17:18:02] <taplar> right, ddd is undefined
[17:18:26] <jquery775> before document ready it is undefined
[17:18:34] <jquery775> but inside document.ready
[17:18:53] <jquery775> i can access everything only by using id's
[17:19:01] <jquery775> without any selectors
[17:19:09] <jquery775> like this simple
[17:19:17] <jquery775> console.log(ddd);
[17:19:29] <taplar> huh
[17:19:49] <jquery775> and i don't understand why it is working
[17:19:49] <taplar> i wonder if js is putting things with ids on the global scope
[17:20:12] <jquery775> but why in document.ready and why id's
[17:20:21] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/vu8meqt7/ ya, javascript is putting the elements with ids on the window
[17:20:37] <taplar> that's interesting
[17:21:14] <jquery775> ok but it means that i don't have to use selectors or what ?
[17:22:01] <jquery775> i don't have to declare any elements that has id's ?
[17:22:19] <taplar> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3434278/do-dom-tree-elements-with-ids-become-global-variables#3434388
[17:23:24] <taplar> so ya, seems like you could opt for window access for id elements instead of a lookup
[17:23:36] <jquery775> hmm but it's still bit weird
[17:23:39] <taplar> whither or not you 'should', idk
[17:24:14] <jquery775> sry i don't get it
[17:24:39] <jquery775> can u explain more precise ?
[17:25:07] <taplar> i'm saying it does indeed look like elements with ids are put on the document element for direct access.  but if you should use that vs a lookup, i don't know the answer to that
[17:25:48] <taplar> sorry, window
[17:25:55] <jquery775> ok
[17:26:10] <jquery775> got it
[17:27:06] <jquery775> interesting
[17:27:24] <jquery775> also that i discovered it so late
[17:27:57] <taplar> the fact that getElementById still exists makes me think there must be some reason to avoid it.
[17:28:52] <jquery775> ok
[17:29:01] <jquery775> ok thx for help
[17:30:56] <taplar> maybe hit up ##javascript , those bros might know more
[17:31:26] <robertmaxrees> it's an old, funky holdover feature.
[17:31:47] <robertmaxrees> i'd avoid using any vars that you didn't declare yourself or that aren't apart of the "standard api"
[17:32:08] <TimCoal> doesnt JQ just call getElementById under the hood?
[17:32:18] <taplar> if it can ya
[17:32:38] <robertmaxrees> when appropriate yeah.
[17:32:40] <TimCoal> JQ isn't a replacement for JQ
[17:32:51] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[17:33:36] <TimCoal> i always used to wrap it in helper functions and never call it directly
[17:33:47] <taplar> 'it'?
[17:33:51] <robertmaxrees> jquery?
[17:34:59] <TimCoal> it = the function in the active conversation block - ie getElementById
[17:36:00] <taplar> you don't like to call it directly?
[17:36:05] <TimCoal> jQuery is a wrapper and dificult and pointless to wrap again
[17:36:22] <taplar> getElementById isn't jQuery
[17:38:02] <TimCoal> its not that i don't like to call it directly, but i don't like to type it, its long.  plus you can fold useful other actions in to one call, like getting its value
[17:38:30] <TimCoal> its a form of logic compression
[17:38:38] <taplar> heh, ok
[17:38:59] <TimCoal> logic reduction is one of my strengths
[17:39:37] <TimCoal> if always felt that if i worked long enough on a bit of code it would come down to one line, somehow
[17:39:55] <taplar> sounds like i'd hate to come in behind you
[17:40:47] <TimCoal> hey btw, thank you to you and the channel generally for effectivly teaching me about jQuery
[17:42:02] <TimCoal> once i finish something it stays finished.  If you mean to extend it, you would be happy to be looking through anti-code-bloat code and probably be finished by lunchtime, but bill for the week
[17:46:13] <jonez> greetings. I'm currently using jquery 1.12.3 via google cdn. I just noticed today that the latest version is 3.1.x, which would be a couple of major versions. I have not been able to find any 'upgrade' docs or changelogs to assist in making a decision to upgrade. any ideas? :)
[17:47:38] <TimCoal> there are three main streams. all are current
[17:48:17] <TimCoal> 1.x, 2.x 3.x you are on a reasonably uptodate version of 1.x
[17:49:06] <TimCoal> 2 and three are more or less the same language, 2.x was a version upgrade and 3.x is the latest
[17:50:04] <TimCoal> 1.x had a lot of hacks to get it going, which were cleand up, but not possible to completly tidy up, without breaking existing code
[17:50:44] <TimCoal> 2.x made this change, but still had things needing doing, hence 3.x
[17:52:35] <TimCoal> the only 2 real questions you need to ask in moving to 3 is: a. Do you need to support old versions of IE and other browsers b. do you have the time to make any conversions of depreciated function names
[17:53:09] <TimCoal> 3.x takes advantage of modern browsers, but drops support for older browsers
[17:53:19] <taplar> jonez: what browser support do you need?
[17:53:39] <jonez> taplar, I only care about (older) ff and maybe chrome
[17:53:52] <jonez> I can easily change the include to the new version and test my sites to see if they fail
[17:54:31] <taplar> then you could try going to 3x directly and see what breaks, or go to 2x
[17:54:41] <taplar> really if you are not concerned with IE you could have been on 2x already
[17:55:01] <TimCoal> as microsoft.com will give you a splash screen telling you your browser is not supported with IE8, i say its time we droped the older browser support and let them decompile in peace
[17:55:35] <taplar> that's a programmer view point though.  not really a business view point
[17:55:39] <TimCoal> there are helper scripts that will help you make the transition through the versions
[17:55:45] <jonez> I'm mostly a coder. I have to handle the business side too
[17:56:06] <taplar> my last statement was towards TimCoal
[17:56:08] <TimCoal> is it for inhouse consumption or public?
[17:56:08] <jonez> I don't think I will have too much trouble. I'm not using jquery all that much except for SmoothState at the moment
[17:56:18] <jonez> taplar, apologies
[17:57:08] <TimCoal> what is the business point of view that favours OpEx on somthing no one uses
[17:57:18] <taplar> your assuming no one uses it
[17:57:32] <TimCoal> more a wish
[17:57:33] <taplar> there may be cases where the user base of a company has a number of users who do
[17:57:43] <taplar> you can't just turn away customers
[17:57:54] <TimCoal> as microsoft wont even show its home page in IE8, i think thats a clear sign
[17:58:12] <taplar> lol, microsoft isn't god of business decisions
[17:58:37] <taplar> and they have a vested interest in making older IE versions go away
[17:58:41] <TimCoal> depends where the company sets its bar for customers, if you want to scrape the barrle go ahead
[17:58:53] <TimCoal> as we all do
[17:59:05] <taplar> ok, none of this has anything to do with jQuery, :s
[17:59:47] <TimCoal> as a software company, if my potential customers are tight and stupid then i personally am happy to filter them out
[18:00:11] <TimCoal> yes it does, its about which version to choose
[18:00:33] <taplar> which we stated.  this is now about opinions on browser support
[18:00:38] <taplar> which is not on topic
[18:01:32] <TimCoal> taplar, no M$ isnt the god of business decissions.  The first thing i would advise is to upgrade its software and not use old buggy insecure rubbish, especailly from microsoft
[18:01:40] <Bryce_F> hello
[18:01:46] <TimCoal> hello
[18:02:00] <robertmaxrees> hullo
[18:02:11] <Bryce_F> what's faster for forever-animating a bunch of html elements? jquery or css3?
[18:02:13] <TimCoal> its near topic
[18:02:33] <taplar> prefer css over jquery
[18:02:35] <robertmaxrees> css pretty much always Bryce_F
[18:02:37] <taplar> and js for that matter
[18:02:56] <Bryce_F> cool, thanks
[18:03:19] <TimCoal> youre welcome
[18:03:31] <robertmaxrees> wut
[18:03:58] <TimCoal> what?
[18:04:09] <robertmaxrees> lol just lost.
[18:04:12] <robertmaxrees> it's all good mang
[18:04:34] <TimCoal> sveety
[18:04:44] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[18:04:57] <TimCoal> typo
[18:05:07] <TimCoal> and local slang
[18:05:12] <robertmaxrees> for?
[18:05:36] <TimCoal> sweet = all good
[18:05:48] <robertmaxrees> oh, i'm familiar with that.
[18:05:57] <robertmaxrees> i'm from CA.  we say that a lot.
[18:06:06] <TimCoal> and the y adding a diminutive
[18:06:29] <robertmaxrees> lol
[18:06:45] <TimCoal>  cute/friendly
[18:07:06] <robertmaxrees> or condescending ;)
[18:07:13] <robertmaxrees> either way!
[18:07:27] <TimCoal> anyhow. had a mad hardware collapse and only just got back
[18:08:17] <TimCoal> its all point of view/concepts, apply which ever you like
[18:08:30] <robertmaxrees> okay?
[18:09:51] <TimCoal> its all circular, so no point is fully valid, just 'a point'
[18:09:51] <TimCoal> spent too many years working with binary :p
[18:10:10] <robertmaxrees> ...
[18:10:11] <robertmaxrees> lol
[18:10:12] <robertmaxrees> okay?
[18:10:21] <robertmaxrees> I'm not really sure what you're trying to get at, but awesome!
[18:10:25] <TimCoal> realised reality isn't binary
[18:10:30] <TimCoal> or real
[18:10:34] <robertmaxrees> cool.
[18:10:41] <robertmaxrees> so hey camn we get roughly back on topic?
[18:12:15] <robertmaxrees> taplar what're you working on these days?>
[18:12:32] <robertmaxrees> last i remember you couldn't really talk about it, yeah?
[18:12:58] <taplar> oh finally past that.  still doing some performance tuning, but now it's in the js rather than the groovy stuff
[18:13:02] <taplar> much happier now, :)
[18:13:05] <jonez> TimCoal, so you took the red pill? ;)
[18:13:21] <robertmaxrees> oh sweet.  what was it?
[18:13:59] <TimCoal_> i have something new, i'm toying with in my mind, Electron and JS based desktop applications
[18:14:03] <TimCoal_> https://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwiaoZrqs-rPAhWpAcAKHaP0BmUQFggeMAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Felectron.atom.io%2F&usg=AFQjCNGivIdPkpfqh-P_74wpCYVCcfhIIQ
[18:14:17] <TimCoal_> looks very powerful, maybe too powerful
[18:14:17] <robertmaxrees> heard of electron before.
[18:14:29] <robertmaxrees> a lot of people use it for desktop applications.
[18:14:36] <robertmaxrees> wait what?  "too powerful"?
[18:14:40] <TimCoal_> i like the concept but not sure its fully there yet
[18:14:43] <taplar> lots of repetitive stuff.  our app is by and large a strange beast in that it's all driven by the data.  the main page is created purely by the data and how the admins change how it looks and such
[18:15:00] <taplar> the part that i was working on was the validation for saves, which was, in a way, trying to go to granular with it
[18:15:03] <robertmaxrees> TimCoal_ it's there - trust me.  plenty of people have had good success with it,.
[18:15:14] <TimCoal_> taplay sounds like i'd like that system
[18:15:16] <robertmaxrees> taplar soundss a LOT like what we do.
[18:15:33] <TimCoal_> thats how i work, folding the logic into the data structures and content
[18:15:34] <robertmaxrees> funny how similar different ecom backends are at the end of the day.
[18:15:42] <taplar> and given that i wasn't on the team when it was written, i was walking on egg shells, unit tests, and function tests to make sure i didn't break stuff
[18:15:57] <robertmaxrees> ouch.
[18:16:23] <taplar> yeah, it's the attributing system for our shop
[18:16:33] <TimCoal_> i used to work on bloomberg TV and the J-data screens are a rats nest of hacks and work that way, it was nasty, i hope its been tiedied up
[18:16:44] <robertmaxrees> oooh. neat taplar
[18:18:37] <TimCoal_> robertmaxrees, when you come away from the western premis that there is black and white and realise that its ilogical to have more than two things and there is only one thing
[18:18:47] <robertmaxrees> TimCoal_ 2 things:
[18:18:53] <taplar> now we're going through the js looking for performance gains.  giving anon functions names so they're hoasted.  trying to cut down on GC, etc.
[18:19:07] <robertmaxrees> 1: you're making a crazy assumption about my personal beliefs and, as a result, being kind of rude right now.
[18:19:10] <taplar> really want to get rid of jquery ui as all we're using is the datepicker and autocomplete
[18:19:12] <robertmaxrees> 2: please stay roughly on topic.
[18:19:23] <robertmaxrees> feel free to PM me if you'd like to talk more.  thanks!
[18:19:28] <TimCoal_> statements like every backend system is the same and in the same breath every back end system is unique, isn't confusing
[18:19:36] <robertmaxrees> that's not what i said at all.
[18:19:48] <robertmaxrees> i said they're similar :)
[18:20:10] <TimCoal_> similar is a generalisation of what i said
[18:20:24] <robertmaxrees> why are you attacking me right now?
[18:20:30] <TimCoal_> generalisation is a fundimental part of language
[18:20:36] <robertmaxrees> *sigh*
[18:20:51] <robertmaxrees> i don't know what your problem is with me, but please drop it.  pm me if you'd like.
[18:20:54] <robertmaxrees> thanks!
[18:20:54] <TimCoal_> i don't feel like i am why do you feel atacked?  i feel liek were talking
[18:21:06] <dartlen> !help
[18:21:14] <robertmaxrees> you're massively derailing the channel and being awfully condescending for absolutely nor reason :)
[18:21:17] <taplar> dartlen: sup
[18:21:39] <robertmaxrees> anyway!
[18:21:52] <robertmaxrees> taplar you guys are on a java-based stack, right?
[18:21:56] <TimCoal_> robertmaxrees i wasn't talking about you specifically
[18:22:08] <taplar> robertmaxrees: groovy/grails, so ya
[18:22:13] <dartlen> taplar: have problem, send XMLHttpRequest apache server, but get error "Response to preflight request doesn't pass access control check: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource. Origin 'null' is therefore not allowed access."  have line xhr.setRequestHeader("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", '*');
[18:22:23] <robertmaxrees> TimCoal_ great!  please move on.  thanks :)
[18:22:36] <taplar> dartlen: you're trying to make a CORS request it looks like
[18:22:46] <taplar> the destination server is denying it
[18:22:48] <TimCoal_> sorry robber i just see things in greater detail than a lot of people, they don't get what i see
[18:24:05] <robertmaxrees> Anyway!
[18:24:29] <taplar> eventually our frontend is going to rewritten in angular so that will be interesting to learn finally
[18:25:41] <robertmaxrees> oooh i always love a good rewrite.
[18:28:21] <drej> taplar: you should be moving to react by now
[18:28:21] <drej>  :)
[18:28:31] <robertmaxrees> that's what we're doing with our storefront.
[18:28:33] <taplar> not my decision.  i'm not a uxer, :)
[18:28:43] <taplar> and angular is the new koolaid in the shop
[18:29:19] <robertmaxrees> ah yeah, java devs.
[18:29:22] <taplar> though I am thinking about trying to do some tinkering with reactjs in a vm to see if I can get it to work with some sort of php project.  as a side job
[18:30:51] <taplar> i gotta learn something new.  getting stale
[18:32:44] <taplar> not that i've mastered js and jquery, but ya know, :D
[18:33:01] <robertmaxrees> lol
[18:33:23] <robertmaxrees> i've got a few ideas i've been rolling around in my head.  i need to jhump on them at some point.
[18:36:56] <dartlen> taplar: can't fix now write Origin 'null' is therefore not allowed access.
[18:37:19] <taplar> $.ajax has an option for setting request headers if you check the docs
[18:37:29] <taplar> but if the destination server doesn't support your site, your sol
[18:38:12] <taplar> without doing some sort of local proxy or, maybe something else.  i don't deal with cors much
[18:39:10] <dartlen> okay (._. ) try more docs
[19:06:16] <taplar> later all, time i head out of here
[19:06:25] <robertmaxrees> kbyeeeeee
[19:35:55] <souravbadami> Someone know about:  $form->getHttpData($form::DATA_TEXT,  'fieldName');
[19:36:55] <souravbadami> I'm trying to get the data from a selectBox which is updated via jQuery. I'm trying to get the data in PHP.
[19:36:56] <robertmaxrees> looks like php to me.
[19:37:05] <robertmaxrees> i'd ask in ##php
[19:38:09] <souravbadami> I tried, No one's there.
[19:38:17] <robertmaxrees> lol
[19:38:20] <souravbadami> :)
[19:38:43] <robertmaxrees> doesn't change the topic here - just sayin' :)
[19:38:43] <systemfault> Time to change your server-side language to something more hipster ;)
[19:58:19] <MrPunkin> Is there a way to bind an event to watch an element for additional event bindings?
[19:58:31] <robertmaxrees> mope.
[20:00:16] <MrPunkin> Whatâ€™s the best way to override the event being bound during the document ready function existing in an included script? I have a script included in all pages on my site, but for one page I need to override a binding.
[20:00:44] <robertmaxrees> do you have the ability to modify the script?
[20:00:58] <MrPunkin> I do, was just hoping for an easy one-off way on this page
[20:01:12] <MrPunkin> but I can just modify that included script to be more aware of when to bind and not
[20:01:15] <robertmaxrees> and you're not binding the event, you're binding the handler :) subtle but important distinction.
[20:01:47] <robertmaxrees> so one way is to use classes and then have your server change those as appropriate.
[20:04:16] <MrPunkin> Sure, sorry for the terminology
[22:34:04] <CSGSJay> Hi, could anyone try and help me please, here is what i've tried https://jsfiddle.net/L9w9com1/ , what I'm trying to achieve is to change the class of a div setting it to a loop, i'd like to constantly change the class of the div every x seconds with an array of different classes
