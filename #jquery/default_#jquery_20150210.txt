[00:03:20] <ladisman69> Your mom looked lovely last night when i fucked her last night
[00:03:50] <ladisman69> I AM CUCKKING
[00:06:11] <ladisman69> The cuck
[00:10:53] <ladisman69> Bbb
[00:11:48] <stompdar1ach> funny stuff
[00:12:21] <Cork> he has been going on through out the network
[00:12:32] <Cork> the sops has been dealing with it
[01:12:20] <simion314> hi all, I am cleaning up some code in a project and my IDE shows that the 'nth' in this expresions is an error ,  "$('input[name=optionsRadios]:nth(3)').val(); " I can't find the nth on google only nth-child , so is this an error or the IDE is wrong
[01:13:01] <Cork> simion314: :nth isn't a css psudo selector
[01:13:28] <simion314> Cork: any idea what the developer ment then?
[01:13:51] <Cork> most likely :nth-child or :eq()
[01:14:08] <Cork> hard to say that's the correct
[01:14:09] <simion314> thank you
[01:14:26] <Cork> simion314: note :eq and :nth-child is radiacally different
[01:49:14] <multi_io_> is there an easy way to veto a change event on a select input? e.preventDefault() doesn't prevent the UI change.
[01:49:50] <multi_io_> I don't really understand what e.preventDefault() prevents at all in this case.
[01:50:19] <Cork> multi_io_: you would have the change event happens after the change has happened
[01:50:28] <Cork> it won't help preventing that event
[01:50:38] <Cork> you would have to set the value to what you want it to be
[01:50:42] <multi_io_> Cork: yeah, I'd need a "changing" event
[01:50:52] <multi_io_> that occurs before the change
[01:50:53] <Cork> there isn't one
[01:51:02] <multi_io_> alright, bummer
[01:51:34] <multi_io_> so I have to actively set the select input back to the previous value
[01:51:46] <Cork> yes
[01:52:15] <multi_io_> is the previous value recorded in the change event?
[01:52:42] <Cork> no
[01:53:48] <Cork> multi_io_: simplest is to just push the old value into $(this).data('old-value', $(this).val()) or something like that
[01:53:56] <Cork> and then set it if you need to
[01:54:09] <Filystyn> when i have this : var $p = $("<p> Some par </p>") -  cant i use it two times that variable?
[01:54:32] <Filystyn> i tried appending 2 times $p and it failed (appends one time)
[02:07:47] <Cork> Filystyn: no
[02:07:55] <Cork> that line creates a p element
[02:08:03] <Cork> and elements doesn't clone by them self
[02:08:11] <Cork> you have to do that by calling .clone()
[02:08:38] <Cork> if you append an element multiple times you MOVE it
[02:13:36] <Filystyn> aaaahhh
[02:13:39] <Filystyn> Cork
[02:13:42] <Filystyn> Thank you
[02:13:43] <Filystyn> :)
[02:39:00] <CoffeeMarker> var this_option = $('.options').filter('[data-linked_id="'+show_id+'"]');
[02:39:05] <CoffeeMarker> why doesnt this find anything?
[02:39:41] <Cork> is the data-linked_id really an attribute?
[02:40:18] * sacho doesn't see the benefit of concatenating strings like that instead of just using a function
[02:40:20] <Cork> try  $('.options').filter(function() { return $(this).data('linked_id') == show_id; })
[02:40:27] <Cork> sacho: same here
[02:42:34] <CoffeeMarker> thx cork, that works
[02:48:47] <delboy1978uk> hey guys, any decent libraries for generating a tree like diagram? php or js, i dont mind, asking in both
[03:00:26] <daedeloth> is there a way to detect ie8 in jquery?
[03:00:49] <sacho> why do you need to detect ie8?
[03:00:53] <Cork> there is the depricated $.browser.msie
[03:01:23] <Cork> but it is usually better to feature sniff then checking for browser version
[03:02:04] <shwaiil> hi
[03:02:25] <daedeloth> well right now ie8 just stops with an error
[03:02:29] <daedeloth> I'd like to show a "deprecated" message
[03:02:51] <Cork> daedeloth: just have a static element and show it with a conditional comment
[03:03:03] <Cork> no need to have js do it
[03:03:14] <daedeloth> hmm, true
[03:03:19] <shwaiil> Q: how to select elements that have NOT `stringName` ?  <ul> <li data-foo="bar boo par stringName"></li> <li data-foo="bar boo par"></li></ul>
[03:03:44] <Cork> shwaiil: use classes not random data field
[03:03:56] <sacho> that seems like an awful way to transmit data to your application
[03:03:57] <Cork> you would basically have to reimplement the class engine to do that
[03:04:06] <shwaiil> Cork: thanks for looking. Ok I see
[03:04:13] <caper> var xmlhttp =new XMLHttpRequest();  i post the data
[03:04:33] <caper> but i want to know how to fetch the data on another side
[03:04:46] <Cork> another side?
[03:04:51] <Cork> you mean cross domain?
[03:05:46] <caper> yup
[03:06:04] <Cork> you can only do cross domain ajax if the server you send the request TO allows it
[03:06:22] <daedeloth> Cork, do you mean show a message and remove it on load? Or conditional elements?
[03:06:39] <Cork> ?g conditional comment

[03:07:14] <caper> Cork how to fetch i don't know
[03:07:29] <drag0nius> how can i pop item from jquery object?
[03:08:07] <Cork> drag0nius: .filter or .slice
[03:08:40] <Cork> caper: also looks like you should ask this in ##javascript not #jquery
[03:09:00] <Cork> caper: and not sure what you're asking for

[03:29:12] <gtristan> What events should I listen to for "any change in a textarea" ?
[03:29:52] <Pathum> Hi Anyone here ?
[03:30:07] <Cork> gtristan: most likely the input event
[03:30:41] <Pathum> I have a question'
[03:30:44] <gtristan> Cork, that will handle paste and the like ?
[03:30:52] <gtristan> Pathum, "dont ask to ask, just ask"
[03:31:14] <delboy1978uk> gtristan: $('#textarea').change();
[03:31:15] <Cork> gtristan: "yes" with some caveats
[03:31:29] <gtristan> Cork, alright, good enough for me :)
[03:31:36] <gtristan> ah, I'll look at the .change() api docs
[03:31:37] <Cork> ?mdn input event
[03:31:37] <b-ot> Cork: input - Event reference | MDN → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/input
[03:31:53] <Cork> gtristan: change fires when the field loses focus though
[03:31:54] <gtristan> wasnt aware of that API (I was thinking .on ('change') or such )
[03:32:11] <Cork> and .change is just a shorthand for .on('change'
[03:32:30] <Pathum> I recommended Jquery for a his developments and he mentioned...While Jquery is great for manipulating the DOM, it doesn't really, imo (YMMV), offer much for Single Page App development, out of the box. For that, you need some MVC, which can be added/implemented in JQuery
[03:32:30] <gtristan> ah, I see... so 'change' fires /only/ when it loses focus ?
[03:32:37] <Cork> yes
[03:32:57] <gtristan> I was going to add a timeout and commit things if focus remains for a while in the same textarea
[03:33:26] <Pathum> Whats does it mean ?
[03:33:53] <gtristan> Pathum, MVC ?
[03:33:55] <Omar-> Pathum it means, use Angularjs for MVC
[03:34:09] <gtristan> I do my own thing, but sure :)
[03:34:32] <gtristan> Pathum, think of jquery like a nice and practical cross-platform toolkit, but for the web :)
[03:34:40] <gtristan> you still need to do your own business logic, of course
[03:35:21] <Omar-> Cork .change() == .trigger("change") ?
[03:35:23] <Pathum> oh ok
[03:35:28] <sacho> angular is not an mvc framework
[03:35:32] <delboy1978uk> Cork: keyup
[03:35:37] <Omar-> .change() without arguements
[03:35:57] <sacho> Omar-, yes
[03:36:29] <Cork> delboy1978uk: keyup doesn't catch paste events
[03:36:50] <mooncup> unless you use ctrl+v!
[03:36:51] <Omar-> sacho thanks :)
[03:36:53] <mooncup> (probably)
[03:37:13] <delboy1978uk> add in another trigger for the mouse to othen
[03:37:22] <delboy1978uk> which i diont know how lol
[03:37:35] <Cork> also keyup doesn't trigger on key repeats
[03:37:42] <Cork> so ya, normally a bad choice
[03:39:12] <gtristan> hmmm, not firing... lets jsfiddle it :-S
[03:46:20] <gtristan> Hmm, this doesnt seem to work: http://jsfiddle.net/dqugck9L/ .. with .change()
[03:48:01] <gtristan> oh strange, I'm getting varied results... hold on... lemme fix
[03:49:21] <gtristan> really strange, is output.text() not supposed to work like that on a <span> ? http://jsfiddle.net/tusr59hb/
[03:49:49] <gtristan> The console.log() is catching it anyway... and if I do .on ('input', function() { .... }); then I get the input too as it's typed
[03:51:21] <Cork> gtristan: it does
[03:51:45] <gtristan> then I'm just not seeing it update in the jsfiddle ?
[03:51:51] <Cork> gtristan: <div id="output"/> <-- isn't valid
[03:52:06] <gtristan> I thought I changed it to span
[03:52:09] <Cork> <div id="output"/> == <div id="output"> not <div id="output"></div>
[03:52:23] <Cork> same for the textarea
[03:52:46] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/dqugck9L/4/
[03:54:13] <gtristan> aha
[03:54:40] <gtristan> How come ? is that a thing ? ... like <thing/> !== <thing></thing> ?
[03:54:53] * gtristan confused, seems to have always worked before
[03:54:59] <Cork> <eml/> is xhtml not html
[03:55:13] <Cork> your allowed to write <elm/> for self closing elements
[03:55:22] <Cork> but the parser will just ignore the /
[03:55:32] <Cork> not create a closing tag like it does in xml
[03:56:13] <Cork> so basically the /> is just a wasted byte
[03:56:31] <gtristan> mhm... so there exists "self closing elements" which are gonna behave differently... yay...
[03:56:42] * gtristan multiplies the possibilities by another factor
[03:56:57] <Cork> gtristan: yes <br> <img> <link> <meta>
[03:56:59] <Cork> to name a few
[03:57:08] <Cork> <input>
[03:57:23] <Cork> think that is about all of them
[03:58:41] <gtristan> well, that fixes my textarea
[03:58:43] <Cork> ah, right <hr> and <col>
[04:20:23] <K4T> maybe someone here will have an idea how to solve it: How I can auto expand collapsed elements on desktops with Twitter Bootstrap? I have some elements on my page which have to be always expanded on desktops. On mobiles they have to behave like accordions
[04:32:55] <delboy1978uk> hi guys, trying to use kinetic to draw some circles from my json. i've taken some demo code and commented out a lot of it, its drawing some hard coded circles at the minute can anyone help? i need a circle for each of my supplies json objects http://jsbin.com/pavibaroji/1/edit?html,js,output
[04:40:34] <delboy1978uk> ah its quite easy. .each() and then buildAnchor(x,y);
[04:43:22] <synthecypher> What's the best way to get all the elements under the point in z-order?
[04:43:44] <Cork> synthecypher: there isn't one
[04:43:57] <synthecypher> Cork: :'(
[04:44:00] <Cork> you would have to loop over every single element and calcualte the zindex
[04:44:42] <synthecypher> Guess I'll have to for each AABB test all of my targets then.
[04:45:01] <Cork> synthecypher: what are you trying to do?
[04:46:00] <synthecypher> Have items which you drag into boxes and if the items are dragged into the correct box they center align and turn the box green, else they animate back to their original position.
[05:17:25] <Luser> Hi guys. I've got some code, which basically looks like that: element.on('click', function(e){alert( 'something') }); and it works just fine in chrome, safari, but not firefox. Using angular 2.1.3
[05:17:40] <Luser> I mean Firefox doesn't even go inside that function.
[05:17:47] <Luser> Also tried with bind() and element.click
[05:21:14] <aro> where could i get some kind of slider that has a gradient spectrum that goes from 0 to 100%

[05:35:00] <Joonaa> Hello, I'd like to send the .html of an element to the server. How could I do that?
[05:35:05] <Joonaa> .html()*
[05:36:09] <Meir`> Joonaa, with .ajax() or .post()
[05:38:06] <Joonaa> Meir`: any way to do it like a normal form (reload the page9?
[05:38:08] <Joonaa> )*
[05:39:08] <Meir`> you can create a dummy form using jquery
[05:39:48] <prohobo> NO
[05:39:53] <Joonaa> and then set the .html() as a value or something?
[05:40:09] <Meir`> yeah, but it's not recommended at all
[05:41:16] <mbrzuzy> Joonaa, why do you need to use a form with a page reload?
[05:41:21] <Meir`> if you already have a server side page that accepts form data (POST / GET / REQUEST), you can easily use .ajax() or .post() / .get()
[05:41:36] <mbrzuzy> You may be looking at the problem from the wrong perspective
[05:43:25] <Joonaa> because i dont really want to build handling for ajax :)
[05:44:36] <mbrzuzy> Does anything on your front end change after the data is posted?
[05:44:36] <Meir`> you probably would use same server side code with a form
[05:44:59] <bl4ckdu5t> I'll rehash my past question. I have this http://pastie.org/9934856 and I want to exempt links with href="javascript:print()". How can I?
[05:45:31] <Joonaa> mbrzuzy no, but im making this for idiots :)
[05:45:33] <mbrzuzy> bl4ckdu5t, you will need to use $(':not(:contains())')
[05:45:48] <bl4ckdu5t> What was I thinking. I just thought of not and yours came in
[05:46:38] <mbrzuzy> Joonaa, then your back-end can remain unchanged even if you use ajax
[05:46:42] <mbrzuzy> and just post the data
[05:47:04] <bl4ckdu5t> what of $('a:not('[href="javascript:print()"]')')
[05:47:37] <Joonaa> mbrzuzy but i need to show the user it did something
[05:47:43] <bl4ckdu5t> escape quote where needed
[05:47:52] <Cork> bl4ckdu5t: why not just replace that link?
[05:48:08] <Cork> convert it to a <button> with window.print() as an event handler
[05:48:23] <mbrzuzy> Joonaa, that would be simple to do.  What you actually do will depend on how the request is triggered
[05:48:40] <bl4ckdu5t> Cork. It's an SVG icon
[05:48:46] <Cork> ok?
[05:48:57] <Cork> doesn't change anything
[05:49:14] <Joonaa> mbrzuzy call me lazy, but this way i just need to post it, instead of creating error handling etc :)
[05:49:41] <mbrzuzy> lol
[05:49:59] <mbrzuzy> if you spent the time you did looking for an alternative to just do it, it would have been done
[05:50:01] <bl4ckdu5t> SVG in a button? That will take extra styling to have it not get button effects
[05:50:31] <Joonaa> mbrzuzy maybe, but this will do :)
[05:50:38] <mbrzuzy> xD
[05:51:10] <Joonaa> and to be fair, joining an irc channel and asking a question takes much less time than figuring out ajax
[05:51:44] <neuromute9> hey peeps, I have a plugin that instantiates another plugin in an inner function.  so showGallery() would run $('#div').jcarousel()
[05:52:00] <Cork> bl4ckdu5t: http://jsfiddle.net/ugfc26ph/
[05:52:02] <daum> hey guys - i'm trying to use jquery ui's sortable on a table.  My table has rows which are "summary" and rows which are more or less a "child" rows of that summary row.  The issue is when a person clicks I remove all the non-summary rows, the element you are dragging goes all the way to the top of the screen yet the cursor is where the UI detects the element.  Here is an example:  http://jsfiddle.net/r5ad83L5/1/  click and drag the second
[05:52:02] <daum> to bottom "hi" and you notice it is way above the cursor as the table jumped.  Trying to fix that
[05:52:06] <neuromute9> only issue is that when showGallery is run, I get undefined is not a function
[05:52:12] <Cork> just replace the "Print" text with what ever html you want there
[05:52:17] <Cork> or svg or what ever
[05:52:51] <Cork> bl4ckdu5t: sure, all 5 lines of css...
[05:53:15] <islalobo> Hello, I'm trying to create a field that doesn't allow for special characters: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/c4f4e700576db5864412
[05:53:37] <neuromute9> how can I ensure that additional libraries are ready to use in a jquery plugin?
[05:53:52] <Cork> islalobo: keypress isn't a cross browser event use input instead
[05:54:17] <Cork> its simpler to just run the regex and remove the characters not allowed
[05:54:59] <Cork> $('input').on('input', function() { $(this).val($(this).val().replace(/^[a-zA-Z0-9]+$/, '')); });
[05:56:05] <islalobo> will that target all input fields?
[05:58:19] <Cork> islalobo: wasn't meant to be a complete replace
[05:58:32] <Cork> so ya, the selector is just me being lazy
[05:59:14] <Cork> neuromute9: by having it earlier in the html
[05:59:35] <Cork> neuromute9: if the library does async loading you would have to have a callback solution
[06:00:00] <neuromute9> thanks!
[06:01:04] <islalobo> Cork: Even using my selector I can still input special characters
[06:01:22] <Cork> gah, sorry
[06:01:35] <Cork> /^[a-zA-Z0-9]+$/ should be /[a-zA-Z0-9]+/g
[06:01:42] <Cork> (note the g at the end)
[06:02:02] <Cork> except...
[06:02:05] <Cork> that's the wrong thing
[06:02:09] <Cork> one min
[06:02:56] <Cork> neuromute9: http://jsfiddle.net/22c0985t/
[06:03:50] <neuromute9> islalobo, ^^
[06:08:27] <K4T> 1. $('.filters-bar-shop .collapse').collapse('hide'); vs 2. $('.filters-bar-shop').find('.collapse').collapse('hide');
[06:08:34] <K4T> why 1 work 2 not?
[06:09:08] <Cork> there isn't a difference, so it shouldn't
[06:11:42] <K4T> ok, stupid mistakes just happen
[06:11:43] <K4T> :P
[06:13:40] <islalobo> Cork++
[06:14:04] <Joonaa> okay that didnt actually work, i guess ill make the ajax instead...
[06:14:05] <delboy1978uk> what is the quickest/easiest way to draw some connecting lines between a stack of divs on the left, and a stack of divs on the right. one to many lines going left to right
[06:15:22] <Cork> delboy1978uk: depends on if the line have to bend or something like that
[06:15:34] <Cork> if it isn't just straight lines i would prob go with svg
[06:15:39] <Cork> or possibly a canvas
[06:15:39] <delboy1978uk> not really
[06:15:50] <delboy1978uk> straight line would do fine
[06:16:00] <Cork> then just create an element and set a border-top
[06:22:03] <delboy1978uk> like this: but left hand boxes can point at any of the boxes on the right: http://jsbin.com/limuhiyuso/1/edit?html,output
[06:22:08] <Mark_2> go for greensock
[06:24:02] * delboy1978uk googles
[06:45:37] <Tomasso> i cant find a single way to render the style of elements I load from ajax call that works.. i tried everything i found .. adding the style node again , display none and show again, refresh, .page on the element... .trigger('refresh') nothing works .. .can somebody point me to a working example...
[06:49:02] <alexclark_> acidjazz: unfortunately I saw your messages too late
[06:51:14] <neuromute9> Cork, so, if I console.log(jQuery.jCarousel) just before instantiating, I see the plugin details.  If I also do console.log($('#carousel'))... I see the element I want to apply it to.  However, after both these console.logs when I attempt to instantiate $('#carousel').jcarousel(); It still doesn't work.
[06:51:21] <neuromute9> Is this to be expected?
[06:51:46] <Cork> can't say don't know the plugin
[06:52:13] <Cork> most slideshow plugins is really badly written
[06:52:27] <neuromute9> ok, thanks
[06:52:31] <Cork> so something might be expecting something special
[06:52:33] <Cork> donno
[06:52:42] <neuromute9> hmmm, battling away!
[06:55:16] <alexclark_> Problem: I have an iframe that I have no control over its contents. I need to eliminate the scroll bar. Calling iframe.contentWindow.document.body.scrollHeight gets denied.  Is there a way to do this?
[06:56:06] <Cork> alexclark_: only if the script script adding the iframe provides an api for it
[06:57:01] <maxvi> events like mouseover, click don't work on iphone (it works on ipad, desktop)
[06:57:04] <alexclark_> Cork: cool thanks!
[06:57:31] <Cork> how would mouseover work on a touch device??
[07:06:54] <maxvi> Cork: I tried click too and it don't work on iphone
[07:08:10] <delboy1978uk> Cork: got my divs joined up :-) http://jsbin.com/limuhiyuso/1/edit?html,output
[07:08:28] <delboy1978uk> with nice bezier curves!
[07:08:33] <Cork> maxvi: that sounds strange
[07:09:04] <delboy1978uk> maxvi: isn't there a .tap() ?
[07:11:15] <maxvi> delboy1978uk: no just I click
[07:11:26] <Cork> delboy1978uk: cool
[07:11:59] <Cork> maxvi: make a clean html page with no mobile special js
[07:12:08] <Cork> and verify that it doesn't work there
[07:12:13] <Cork> cause it should work just fine
[07:21:32] <aro> does anyone know of a way to display a spectrum thing from 0 to 100%
[07:21:50] <billyJoe> jquerying a cat
[07:21:54] <billyJoe> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBKlU6HCJbs
[07:33:29] <maxvi> Cork: mouseover don't work on div element, so I use touchstart and it works on iphone
[07:53:12] <claz> how can i make this work? $document.one('mouseup', $document.off.bind ($document, 'mousemove', move_fn));
[07:55:43] <BillCriswell> claz: I am not sure exactly what you're doing there.
[07:56:21] <BillCriswell> What's with off.bind ? Are you removing an event or binding a new one or what?
[07:57:27] <claz> i'm binding the function
[07:57:39] <claz> it's a javascript thing not a jquery one, i think
[07:58:24] <claz> but i think it's unjavascriptic, i should've done                     $document.one('mouseup', function() { $document.off ('mousemove', move_fn); });
[07:58:36] <claz> nvm
[07:59:40] <sacho> claz, what are you trying to achieve..?
[08:00:12] <claz> on mousedown i set an event handler for mousemove then i want to set an event handler for mouseup to remove the mousemove
[08:00:19] <claz> but it works now
[08:25:22] <_DB> sup
[08:27:02] <_DB> I have a nested / associative array http://laravel.io/bin/E3LVe  im trying to do a foreach for one of the nested arrays inside of it
[08:27:14] <_DB> but when I do it just gives me object Object
[08:27:49] <_DB> in the link I posted you can see object 0 , has 2 advertisings 0 & 1
[08:28:03] <_DB> im trying to get each key & value for the advertisings
[08:28:52] <_DB> should I just throw it into a for and use its length? and grab the fields I want or can I do it with a foreach?
[08:36:51] <delboy1978uk> Cork: and anyone else who's interested: I've turned that javascript i was mucking around with into a jQuery plugin. You can now hook up parent/child divs with bezier curves in one line of jQuery! https://github.com/delboy1978uk/jqbezier
[08:38:10] <_DB> got it working lol
[08:39:02] <BillCriswell> delboy1978uk: The demo has an error in it.
[08:40:05] <delboy1978uk> what?
[08:40:09] * delboy1978uk checks
[08:40:24] <BillCriswell> http://jsbin.com/nivumoneno/1/
[08:40:47] <delboy1978uk> you're not using IE by any chance?
[08:40:50] <delboy1978uk> (thats a joke btw)
[08:40:53] <BillCriswell> Chrome.
[08:40:55] <BillCriswell> Oh ok.
[08:40:57] <BillCriswell> I get jokes.
[08:41:00] <delboy1978uk> hehe
[08:41:04] <BillCriswell> I know all about jokes.
[08:41:08] <delboy1978uk> whats the error, I'm not seeing one?
[08:41:22] <delboy1978uk> IE, it's like the best joke isnt it?
[08:41:24] <BillCriswell> Uncaught TypeError: undefined is not a function
[08:41:31] <delboy1978uk> eh?
[08:41:49] <MajorWork> delboy1978uk, I know some of these words
[08:42:02] <delboy1978uk> weird, I'm not getting that
[08:42:22] <delboy1978uk> which words MajorWork?
[08:42:44] <BillCriswell> delboy1978uk: The error before that is: Refused to execute script from 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/delboy1978uk/jqbezier/master/src/bezier.js' because its MIME type ('text/plain') is not executable, and strict MIME type checking is enabled.
[08:42:46] <MajorWork> parent/child lost me at bezier curve even though I've heard the term i can't say for certain what it is
[08:42:59] <BillCriswell> delboy1978uk: So maybe your browser is set to be cool with that?
[08:44:50] <delboy1978uk> ah. how does github determine the mime type?
[08:44:56] <delboy1978uk> im using FF
[08:45:31] <BillCriswell> It sets it as text/plain
[08:45:48] <delboy1978uk> by default? for everything?
[08:46:29] <BillCriswell> Appears so.
[08:46:37] <snover> this is why rawgit.com is a thing
[08:46:54] <BillCriswell> In firefox it does work, but I assume it's because firefox isn't worried if it's mime type is text/plain
[08:47:26] <BillCriswell> Yeah what snover said.
[08:47:43] <BillCriswell> delboy1978uk: http://rawgit.com/
[08:48:58] <Glaisher> does .attr( class: 'foo-bar' ) work like .addClass( 'foo-bar' )?
[08:49:25] <BillCriswell> Glaisher: No.
[08:49:47] <BillCriswell> .attr() would need to get an object, and you'd need to quote class in this case cause IE will yell.
[08:50:01] <BillCriswell> and .attr() would remove everything that's currently in class instead of add to it.
[08:50:40] <delboy1978uk> BillCriswell: that looks handy! But lol, I forgot tio add type="text/javascript" in the jsbin lol! can you try it now please? https://github.com/delboy1978uk/jqbezier
[08:50:52] <Glaisher> ok
[08:50:53] <Glaisher> thanks
[08:51:00] <BillCriswell> delboy1978uk: You shouldn't have to add that.
[08:51:14] <delboy1978uk> can you let me know if it works now though?
[08:51:39] <BillCriswell> url?
[08:51:46] <BillCriswell> Not sure if you've changed it or not.
[08:51:55] <BillCriswell> The url that I used before it's still not working.
[08:51:59] <delboy1978uk> as above, just click the demo link
[08:52:19] <delboy1978uk> should take you here now: http://jsbin.com/gadulaxuhu/1/
[08:52:38] <BillCriswell> Still an error.
[08:52:44] <delboy1978uk> ok raw github it is
[08:55:51] <delboy1978uk> ok this should be the last time https://github.com/delboy1978uk/jqbezier
[08:56:22] <BillCriswell> That's a bingo.
[08:56:39] <delboy1978uk> yeehah! Thanks BillCriswell
[08:56:44] <BillCriswell> Welcome.
[08:56:56] <delboy1978uk> hope it comes in useful for someone :-)
[08:57:11] <BillCriswell> Same.
[08:57:13] <delboy1978uk> anyway, time for a cigarette :)
[08:57:16] <delboy1978uk> bbi5
[08:59:38] <guzzlefry> So, I have this <select> element, right? I need to generate a new <div> based on what the user selects, which works fine with the click event on desktop devices, doesn't work on mobile...
[08:59:43] <guzzlefry> What's the proper way to handle this?
[08:59:49] <robertmaxrees> guzzlefry the "change" event
[09:00:24] <guzzlefry> robertmaxrees: Wouldn't that fire each time they hit the up/down arrow keys if the select has focus?
[09:00:40] <robertmaxrees> shouldn't.
[09:00:44] <robertmaxrees> only when it loses focus.
[09:00:50] <guzzlefry> ah, thanks
[09:12:01] <Omar-> which is better with $.ajax(), .success() or .done()?
[09:12:16] <robertmaxrees> .done()
[09:12:29] <Omar-> thanks robertmaxrees :)
[09:13:09] <sacho> .then()
[09:13:13] <daveaway> anyone here using jquery bbq?
[09:13:19] <robertmaxrees> !ask @ daveaway
[09:13:19] <b-ot> daveaway: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[09:13:39] <daveaway> to get the URL params it should be just $.deparam.querystring(); with/
[09:14:24] <robertmaxrees> you can get URL params without a library.
[09:14:30] <daveaway> that's not what i asked
[09:14:37] <robertmaxrees> just pointing it out :)
[09:15:04] <Tawre> $.deparam.querystring() <-- could ou give me an example?
[09:15:07] <Tawre> i don't understand that
[09:15:17] <robertmaxrees> http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-bbq-plugin/ docs for those who aren't familiar
[09:15:43] <robertmaxrees> jQuery.param.querystring() - "Retrieve the query string from a URL or if no arguments are passed, the current window.location." per the docs
[09:15:59] <robertmaxrees> oh deparam
[09:16:02] <Tawre> oh i didn't know it wasn't a part of normal jquery
[09:16:07] <robertmaxrees> it's not.
[09:16:09] <robertmaxrees> it's a plugin.
[09:16:15] <robertmaxrees> i give up hahaha
[09:16:28] <robertmaxrees> i cannot read today apparently.  i'm going to just shut up :X
[09:16:42] <Tawre> i wrote some code that gets url parameters a few months ago but wasn't entirely satisfied
[09:17:02] <Tawre> and when i saw what was said here i thought "there's an easy way in jquery to do that? duck me."
[09:17:12] <robertmaxrees> i usually reach for http://stevenbenner.com/2010/03/javascript-regex-trick-parse-a-query-string-into-an-object/ if i need something complicated.
[09:17:26] <Glaisher> will this work like this: add 'foo-button' class when an option is selected?
[09:17:27] <Glaisher> .one( 'click', function() { $button.button( 'enable' ).addClass( 'foo-button'); } )
[09:17:30] <robertmaxrees> which is basically what that deparam.questyString() function does.
[09:17:56] <Tawre> i can't read regex
[09:17:58] <robertmaxrees> Glaisher as long as your selectors are right, yeah.
[09:18:03] <Glaisher> okay, thanks
[09:18:06] <mooncup> no one can read regex Tawre
[09:18:11] <mooncup> regex is for writing, not reading
[09:18:37] <Tawre> will that work correctly if there are multiple questionmarks?
[09:18:38] <Glaisher> robertmaxrees: how would I make it have a default class? (i.e., when it's disabled)
[09:18:45] <robertmaxrees> Tawre i can't remember.
[09:18:50] <Tawre> you know what i'll just try it?
[09:19:01] <robertmaxrees> Glaisher that should be setup in your markup.
[09:19:17] <w3gi> robertmaxrees, is there something to reset the CSS to the defaults from the css-file?
[09:19:34] <robertmaxrees> w3gi you can only remove styles you set.
[09:19:48] <robertmaxrees> normally, you add a class that sets styles for you and then remove it when you no longer need it.
[09:20:12] <w3gi> i hide some stuff by slideUp or slideDown
[09:20:54] <w3gi> when i rotate a tablet and the nav-bar is hided it is after rotation gone and the show-button also
[09:21:08] <Tawre> it seems to work correctly
[09:21:42] <w3gi> it work great before i use jQuery
[09:21:55] <bs> hey if u can call me i am afellow musician and i think u can help me with a bass problem ,,,, 5164049139 muy nqme is baruch
[09:22:04] <robertmaxrees> bs nice try duder
[09:22:50] <w3gi> after some hiding and showing stuff the browser ignore the CSS-settings and just use settings made by jQuery
[09:23:06] <robertmaxrees> right, becuase jquery applies its own styles.
[09:24:48] <guzzlefry> Well, .on('change'...) isn't working on mobiles...
[09:24:52] <w3gi> ok and wich method remove all styles set by jQuery for element x?
[09:25:00] <robertmaxrees> w3gi none.
[09:25:12] <robertmaxrees> daveaway after reading the docs for jquery bbq, that method call gets you a deserialized object of the current querystring.
[09:25:26] <daveaway> aye, doesnt seem to be working
[09:25:31] <daveaway> just gives me an empty object :{
[09:25:37] <robertmaxrees> have an example?
[09:25:45] <robertmaxrees> guzzlefry should work just fine.
[09:26:11] <daveaway> not really, it's as simple as  blah.com/#post?post_id=1&post_name=a_post
[09:26:22] <robertmaxrees> let me take a look.
[09:26:22] <w3gi> i cant do something like $("#id").style = "";
[09:26:31] <daveaway> it's local
[09:26:42] <robertmaxrees> daveaway right, i'm going to look on my machine.
[09:26:51] <robertmaxrees> slap it into my dev environment, etc.
[09:30:07] <robertmaxrees> grap my local env is hosed atm.  let me try something else.
[09:34:35] <robertmaxrees> hrm, i'm getting an error with the bbq library
[09:35:49] <BillCriswell> robertmaxrees: http://codepen.io/ge1doot/pen/GgOYoy
[09:36:45] <robertmaxrees> daveaway it's becuase you're handling a fragment.
[09:36:54] <robertmaxrees> which looks like it's not covered by the normal QSP
[09:37:47] <robertmaxrees> BillCriswell O.o
[09:37:48] <robertmaxrees> woah
[09:39:15] <robertmaxrees> daveaway try using jQuery.deparam.fragment() instead.
[09:41:30] <BillCriswell> robertmaxrees: Agreed.
[09:49:48] <jakesy> anyone know an IRC client that's feature rich?
[09:51:06] <robertmaxrees> what OS?
[09:51:13] <jakesy> ubuntu
[09:51:46] <tlkr> i use xchat2 on ubuntu
[09:52:59] <jakesy> cool ty
[09:54:43] <tdelam> IRC isn't exactly feature-rich :) what features do you need?
[09:55:26] <tdelam> irssi is great with specific plugins and themes loaded,  you can write some of your own too!
[09:55:46] <robertmaxrees> some people like not having to write things themselves.
[09:56:39] <tdelam> usually don't need to, tons of plugins and scripts available.
[09:56:56] <robertmaxrees> which probably fits their description of "feature rich" :)
[09:58:25] <tdelam> I'm still trying to figure out what features one would possibly need to chat on irc, lol.
[09:58:57] <tdelam> aside from /k /n /b /topic and the /quote and /j of course :)
[09:59:03] <robertmaxrees> automatic highlighting, notifications, sounds, etc.
[09:59:06] <jakesy> well, I just want something that'll clear the chat buffer instead of bogging down my RAM
[09:59:22] <jakesy> I go home for the day and return and my flient is gasping for breath
[09:59:44] <tdelam> jakesy: any console chat application will be great for that.
[09:59:51] <tdelam> irssi + screen = win/win
[10:00:23] <jakesy> woah, terminal IRC
[10:00:30] <jakesy> I could be like, the leetest hacker ever
[10:00:37] <tdelam> Xchat is a memory hog. It's known for having memory leaks.
[10:01:00] <tlkr> i've never had a problem with it tdelam
[10:01:18] <jakesy> my work machine only has 4G of ram :x
[10:01:32] <tdelam> there's an entry on their FAQ about memory leaks with Xchat and a possible resolution
[10:01:43] <tdelam> a few patches exist for xchats mem leak as well.
[10:02:00] <tdelam> I think a lot of the issues are the libraries it depends on when compiling, not so much an sisue with xchat.
[10:02:03] <tdelam> issue*
[10:02:49] <jquery413> hello to all, I need some help using the slideToggle function
[10:03:07] <jquery413> for some reason on click scrolls to the top page
[10:03:28] <robertmaxrees> need to preventDefault() against the event.
[10:04:41] <jquery413> robertmaxrees: http://augustodaniele.com.ar/HTML5/ working case
[10:05:52] <robertmaxrees> not going to dig through all your code yo
[10:06:42] <robertmaxrees> which file has the code in question?
[10:08:02] <jquery413> robertmaxrees: I didn't mean that
[10:08:06] <jquery413> in the index
[10:08:24] <jquery413> line 52 has the JS
[10:08:35] <robertmaxrees> yeah normally we ask for an isolated test case.
[10:08:49] <robertmaxrees> http://fixee.org/paste/l2tfbn1/
[10:08:51] <robertmaxrees> here you go.
[10:09:40] <jquery413> thanks
[10:10:30] <robertmaxrees> preventDefault() against the event :)
[10:10:46] <jquery413> can you please elaborate?
[10:11:04] <robertmaxrees> see where i'm doing e.preventDefault(); ?
[10:13:02] <jquery413> robertmaxrees: thankyou so much!
[10:13:21] <robertmaxrees> fsho
[10:14:50] <guzzlefry> I can't figure out why this won't work. :(
[10:15:12] <robertmaxrees> is it unemployed?
[10:15:21] <guzzlefry> :P
[10:15:34] <guzzlefry> my code works fine in the Chrome device emulator, but not on the actual devices.
[10:15:49] <robertmaxrees> maybe try the input event?
[10:17:51] <robertmaxrees> .on('
[10:18:00] <robertmaxrees> *.on('input', function() {});
[10:19:56] <guzzlefry> Trying that.
[10:21:52] <guzzlefry> no luck
[10:22:01] <robertmaxrees> can you share your code?
[10:22:26] <guzzlefry> unfortunately, no. I can probably throw together a test case though.
[10:22:42] <robertmaxrees> that's what i'm lookin' for.
[10:27:07] <jakesy> robert secretly works for the NSA
[10:27:19] <robertmaxrees> obviously.
[10:27:33] <BillCriswell> I bet I'm flagged by the NSA.
[10:29:20] <jakesy> for... dangerously friendly?
[10:29:34] <jakesy> suspiciously good sense of fashion?
[10:30:32] <BillCriswell> jakesy: Anarchist Cookbook haha
[10:30:55] <BillCriswell> I also read the Al Qaeda training manual online. So I'm sure that'll bite me in the ass one day.
[10:31:05] <Uhkis> at least now you are since this channel is logged ;-)
[10:31:16] <BillCriswell> Uhkis: Yeah I'm fine with it haha
[10:32:03] <Uhkis> until they come and get you!
[10:32:18] <BillCriswell> They wouldn't have to try very hard, believe me.
[10:32:44] <BillCriswell> People in England were arrested for "Downloading" it.
[10:32:52] <BillCriswell> Released after a week.
[10:32:53] <Uhkis> lol
[10:33:49] <BillCriswell> and Anarchist Cookbook I just read for the Black/Blue boxes.
[10:34:09] <BillCriswell> To be fair I think most teenagers read that.
[10:35:08] <robertmaxrees> john draper is a helluva guy
[10:35:23] <guzzlefry> heh well, my stripped down test case works on my phone. :P
[10:37:19] <robertmaxrees> are you adding the content after the page loads in the real version?
[10:37:24] <robertmaxrees> or doing anything else weird?
[10:37:45] <guzzlefry> I'm loading icons after the page loads.
[10:37:55] <robertmaxrees> but not the content in question?
[10:38:07] <robertmaxrees> the thing you're binding to, i mean.
[10:38:19] <guzzlefry> oh, no, that's static
[10:38:57] <robertmaxrees> so what about it "doesn't work"?
[10:40:49] <guzzlefry> robertmaxrees: http://jsfiddle.net/q8jr6gfx/ When you select something from the drop down it creates another contact text input. That part isn't working on the actual site.
[10:40:51] <Es0teric> hey guys i am looking for a js vertical one sided timeline script can anyone help me out?
[10:41:12] <guzzlefry> This looks like a caching issue. -_-
[10:49:23] <baako> when you sent a post via ajax is it an http_headers_only
[11:06:48] <sirdywitda30> Hello. Is there an easy way to remove a registered $.ajaxTransport?
[11:07:19] <sirdywitda30> I'm present on a third-party page and I cannot touch the window object or jQuery as I may be using a copy of one on the page instead of my own.
[11:07:46] <sirdywitda30> I saw something that mentioned registering the name as '+myName' but I'm not sure what the extra + in front does for me
[11:09:26] <checkit> Jquery pros... Need your help... I have a couple hidden forms on a page and based on a selection from a drop down a particular form appears. When that form appears other options become a available but I suspect they're inaccessible in the DOM because my selectors aren't working. I've tried .on, .live and .click.... Other suggestions?
[11:17:24] <umdstu> does anyone know how the fade/transition animation behavior when clicking the icons in the following URL are done?  https://www.google.com/maps/about/explore/
[11:18:43] <checkit> .fadeIn() and .fadeOut()...
[11:19:58] <umdstu> checkit: i thought so but mines not behaving the same way
[11:20:42] <Cork> umdstu: the new maps site is a big canvas
[11:20:46] <umdstu> is one call the callback of the other? serially, both are there for a second take up two lines rather than transitioning on the same line
[11:20:53] <Cork> so they can do what ever they like in there
[11:20:56] <umdstu> lol
[11:20:58] <Cork> and no it isn't dom animations
[11:21:04] <umdstu> alright, i didn't think so
[11:21:09] <umdstu> it was too 'nice' to be that
[11:21:40] <Cork> you could prob get fairly close with svg
[11:24:44] <umdstu> darn. not really my thing
[11:24:56] <checkit> What's wrong w/ something like this? http://jsfiddle.net/0b0dp0s7/
[11:28:33] <sirdywitda30> I'm present on a third-party page and I cannot touch the window object or jQuery as I may be using a copy of one on the page instead of my own.
[11:30:12] <umdstu> checkit: the two separate actions.
[11:30:38] <umdstu> checkit: i don't want them to appear on separate lines
[11:30:43] <robertmaxrees> sirdywitda30 okay?
[11:30:52] <checkit> umdstu: You're trying to chain them?
[11:31:11] <umdstu> checkit: not just chain them, but for them to appear at the same position, overlap really
[11:31:24] <umdstu> so one fades in over top of the other as one is fading out
[11:31:30] <sirdywitda30> Is there any way to remove something registered on $.ajaxTransport?
[11:31:31] <robertmaxrees> you want one to fade out while the other fades in.
[11:31:32] <umdstu> did you look at the google page i linked?
[11:31:47] <umdstu> robertmaxrees: yes but not on separate lines
[11:31:51] <checkit> umdstu: Well, you'll need to add some CSS in there
[11:32:14] <robertmaxrees> umdstu then you're SOL.
[11:32:22] <robertmaxrees> afaik.
[11:32:29] <robertmaxrees> if chaining doesn't work... >.>
[11:32:34] <umdstu> robertmaxrees: haha
[11:32:42] <robertmaxrees> which it won't, because you have two separate objects.
[11:32:46] <umdstu> right
[11:32:47] <robertmaxrees> you need to two separate statements.
[11:33:00] <robertmaxrees> so you overlay one image on the other with CSS>
[11:33:04] <robertmaxrees> then fadeout / fadein.
[11:33:19] <umdstu> right, i have both. i need to somehow have the second statement modify css to position it over stop, perhaps modify the position: attribute
[11:33:39] <umdstu> yea
[11:33:42] <robertmaxrees> you could also just animate opacity on the top one.
[11:33:43] <umdstu> i'm going to play with that
[11:33:47] <umdstu> true
[11:36:06] <robertmaxrees> which is basically what your example does.
[11:36:21] <robertmaxrees> sirdywitda30 afaik, no.
[11:36:28] <robertmaxrees> why are you trying to do that?
[11:37:00] <sirdywitda30> robertmaxrees: I'm on a third-party page and I don't want to alter its version of jquery
[11:37:20] <robertmaxrees> i'm trying to understand why you're doing that.
[11:38:05] <sirdywitda30> a client will be loading my js code onto their page
[11:39:06] <davidpardy> Hello, how would I get my newtreeData variable into the id=“” of my input (line 6)? https://gist.github.com/ornerymoose/ea0c1453398ae2675750
[11:39:09] <robertmaxrees> are you trying to load your own copy of jquery or something?
[11:39:33] <robertmaxrees> davidpardy like any other string concat
[11:39:46] <robertmaxrees> 'somestring ' + somevar + 'some more string';
[11:39:57] <robertmaxrees> '<input type="text" name="category" id="" class="test form-control input-sm" sty...
[11:40:12] <robertmaxrees> woops - : '<input type="text" name="category" id="' + yourVarHere + '" class="test form-control input-sm" sty...'
[11:40:33] <sirdywitda30> robertmaxrees: i am loading my own copy if one is not present, but if it is i need to use that, which means i can't modify it
[11:40:48] <robertmaxrees> sirdywitda30 you can't rely on jquery's presence alone.
[11:41:02] <sirdywitda30> if i could register and unregister a transport everytime i need it i will be good to go but i can't figure out how to clear it
[11:41:16] <robertmaxrees> unless you're 100% certain you're not going to have conflicts with the changes in the api from version to version
[11:41:17] <davidpardy> ah right, duh. thanks robermaxrees!
[11:41:27] <sirdywitda30> robertmaxrees: i'm not, if it's there i use it, if it's not i load my own
[11:42:18] <robertmaxrees> sirdywitda30 that's making some interesting assumptions.
[11:42:29] <robertmaxrees> you might be able to access the low-level jquery ajax system and go from there.
[11:45:31] <sirdywitda30> robertmaxrees: i came across this: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6130894/unregister-or-override-a-custom-ajaxtransport-in-jquery
[11:45:44] <sirdywitda30> but i can't make sense of it, i'm not sure how it helps me
[11:56:26] <umdstu> alright i was able to figure it out
[11:56:48] <_DB> to get the text inside of a h5 tag
[11:56:52] <_DB> would I use its id and .html()
[11:56:53] <umdstu> js to add/remove the class and css for opacity and for transition
[11:56:58] <robertmaxrees> _DB use .text()
[11:57:03] <_DB> ah ok
[11:57:05] <_DB> thanks
[11:57:18] <umdstu> works perfectly
[13:00:30] <SmashingX2> is there any jquery mobile channel?
[13:00:44] <robertmaxrees> this is it.
[13:03:22] <SmashingX2> robertmaxrees: ok good how can I add a slide menu on the left of the page as a filter search for the main page?
[13:03:45] <robertmaxrees> that's kind of a generic question.  what have you tried so far?
[13:08:02] <SmashingX2> robertmaxrees: I’m starting to do it
[13:08:06] <SmashingX2> from scratch
[13:08:24] <SmashingX2> but I was wondering if there’s something that I can take as  sample
[13:08:38] <robertmaxrees> you need to break the problem down into its component parts.
[13:08:59] <dismist> what the fuck
[13:09:28] <robertmaxrees> since otherwise it looks like you're looking for a singular drop-in type of solution :)
[13:39:17] <intermaxim> hei, im using jquery for the first time. I want to use the maphilight function. I copy/paste an example and when I run it, it doesnt work. What am I doing wrong?
[13:43:22] <intermaxim> anyone?
[13:46:10] <doughj31> intermaxim: what does "doesn't work" mean? Have you checked your js console?
[13:48:43] <intermaxim> doughj31: console says: "Failed to load resource: net::ERR_FILE_NOT_FOUND"
[13:48:52] <doughj31> for what file?
[13:49:13] <doughj3> sounds like one of your javascript libraries, maybe jQuery, isn't be loaded?
[13:50:10] <intermaxim> What I did: I went to http://davidlynch.org/projects/maphilight/docs/demo_simple.html, copied the source into html file and opened that. Then I get the error message.
[13:51:01] <doughj3> intermaxim: you need to include jQuery and that maphilight.js script
[13:51:28] <doughj3> http://davidlynch.org/projects/maphilight/jquery.maphilight.js  Download this and put it on your server, and include it in your HTML. Same for jQuery (or easier, use a CDN like Google)
[13:51:31] <ms7> How do I insert a div only if a checkbox is checked and hide that div when it’s unchecked? I have the following code in a script tag but this doesn’t seem to work: http://pastebin.com/z8qgTF6J
[13:53:27] <intermaxim> doughj3: thanks, that solved my problem!
[13:55:00] <the8thbit|work> Hello
[13:55:07] <the8thbit|work> Is there a max length for a selector name?
[13:55:31] <the8thbit|work> or element id length rather
[14:11:18] <BillCriswell> the8thbit|work: Hopefully you'd never hit it, but i imagine there is a theoretical one.
[14:11:54] <the8thbit|work> BillCriswell: Yeah, I was having an unrelated problem, but I solved it
[14:11:58] <the8thbit|work> thanks though

[14:55:53] <guzzlefry> How exactly does that work? :P

[15:12:44] <EvilPerson666> eah

[15:37:08] <coldhead> guys and gals, i need to learn node by 9am tomorrow for a new job. any tips?
[15:38:49] <robertmaxrees> woah
[15:40:04] <robertmaxrees> coldhead how familiar are you with javascript as a language?
[15:43:22] <JohnnyCrow> @coldhead I'm kina new to nodejs but I would make sure you stock up the coffee if you are not close to a 7/11 :)
[15:46:56] <JohnnyCrow> @coldhead egghead.io has some pretty good and straigt to the point videos if you're looking for training videos.
[15:49:10] <coldhead> i've used jquery
[15:49:37] <coldhead> thanks for the tips
[15:49:41] <robertmaxrees> what languages do you have experience with?
[15:49:54] <coldhead> php and js
[15:50:11] <robertmaxrees> mmk - get used to experiencing raw javascript without the DOM apis.
[15:50:22] <coldhead> this is going to hurt isn't it
[15:50:28] <robertmaxrees> a little bit :)
[15:50:46] <Velveeta> yeah, a little.. you'll also have to get used to the node api itself
[15:51:00] <Velveeta> and you'll probably want to familiarize yourself with a good promise library
[15:51:02] <robertmaxrees> ^ which is a lot more barebones than you think.
[15:51:13] <coldhead> do i have to learn io.js too?
[15:51:20] <robertmaxrees> io.js is basically the same thing,'
[15:51:24] <coldhead> phew
[15:52:41] <Velveeta> and if you learn node really well, maybe lucent will give you some free incubator resources
[15:52:48] <Velveeta> but if you learn io, that's a no-go
[15:53:06] <Velveeta> er not lucent, joyent
[15:53:12] <Velveeta> damn ents
[15:53:18] <robertmaxrees> i was about to say...
[15:54:14] <Velveeta> as soon as i hit enter on that, i was like "wait, that's not right is it? lucent or joyent? <google> damnit"
[16:00:29] <hellier> What's the best way to bind a close action to a element?
[16:00:43] <robertmaxrees> depends on a variety of things.
[16:08:27] <Tomashe> hey guys there is a way to resize,merge images without canvas?
[16:09:49] <coldhead> flash?
[16:10:13] <Tomashe> must be something else i can use
[16:10:50] <Tomashe> the thing is im using img src="file:/// and this is giving me some security alerts which do not let me canvas those images
[16:10:57] <Tomashe> i can not change those paths
[16:11:20] <Tomashe> and i must be able to resize and manipulate them on clients browser side
[16:16:35] <Mark_2> i don’t know if i can properly put this into words, does anybody know any website that has tab function? : like when click on the hyperlink it stacks as numerous tabs
[16:32:41] <acidjazz> Mark_2: lolwhat
[16:38:21] <robertmaxrees> Mark_2 you mean like your browser already does?
[16:38:31] <Mark_2> yes exactly.
[16:38:52] <Mark_2> it will be difficult for me to create something like it with my own knowledge of jquery.
[16:39:02] <robertmaxrees> why would you build that?
[16:39:09] <Mark_2> hmmm
[16:39:32] <Mark_2> im inventing a new kind of SNS on my own
[16:39:56] <Mark_2> and having tab like user interface came up as cool.
[16:40:40] <robertmaxrees> you can build tabs pretty easily yourself if you wanted.
[16:40:59] <Mark_2> what makes it complicated is that it has to include detachable function and
[16:41:14] <robertmaxrees> you want to be able to reorder them, right?
[16:41:19] <Mark_2> yes.
[16:41:33] <Mark_2> and it has to be able to not be stacked on each other
[16:41:40] <robertmaxrees> because it'll suck, but you can use drag and drop sortable like.
[16:41:51] <Mark_2> yeah.
[16:41:53] <robertmaxrees> *drag and drop, as well as sortable.
[16:41:56] <robertmaxrees> that's doable with JQUI.
[16:42:07] <Mark_2> but even then it’s complicated.
[16:42:22] <robertmaxrees> not really.
[16:42:46] <robertmaxrees> you have tab objects that are draggables that are constrained to a specific droppable area.
[16:43:48] <Mark_2> nono, that’s easy part.
[16:44:12] <Mark_2> i forgot what i wanted to say lol
[16:44:52] <Mark_2> what if a ‘tab’ is already opened, and if im trying to open another tab?
[16:45:02] <robertmaxrees> what about it?
[16:45:12] <Mark_2> it has to skip the currently opened tabs.
[16:45:17] <Mark_2> that’s the trickypart.
[16:45:19] <Mark_2> i think.
[16:45:22] <robertmaxrees> i don't follow
[16:45:53] <Mark_2> so it’s not just the matter of opening a tab using toggleclass display none and block
[16:46:08] <robertmaxrees> right.
[16:46:16] <robertmaxrees> you can create them.
[16:51:27] <robertmaxrees> on click, create a tab by appending the markup to a section of the site, then init the draggable/sortable stuff on it.
[17:43:40] <b-lew> is there a way to toggle text on a click with a data-attr? if so will it work in ie7 and up?
[17:44:11] <robertmaxrees> care to clarify?
[17:44:55] <acidjazz> can any1 explain to me why my browser is getting all 3 .mp4 vidoeos when their elements are display: none
[17:44:55] <acidjazz> ?
[17:45:04] <b-lew> doing a simple slideToggle but need to swap out the text and image every click. I was going to do the text with the data-attr
[17:45:17] <b-lew> but it needs to work in ie7
[17:45:20] <robertmaxrees> acidjazz because some browsers will download assets even if they're display none.
[17:45:27] <robertmaxrees> b-lew with jquery, yes.
[17:45:57] <b-lew> great! I'll give it a try.
[17:46:13] <acidjazz> robertmaxrees: how hosuld i handle this?
[17:46:19] <acidjazz> should*
[17:46:24] <acidjazz> i got 3 videos i only wanan play 1 random one
[17:46:25] <robertmaxrees> acidjazz create the elements on-demand instead.
[17:46:45] <acidjazz> waht if i just give htem srces
[17:46:52] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[17:46:57] <acidjazz> 'src'
[17:47:16] <robertmaxrees> still not following.
[17:47:30] <b-lew> was going to use this as my markup
[17:47:30] <b-lew> http://jsfiddle.net/p0g2dctx/
[17:47:47] <acidjazz> <source src=xx
[17:47:50] <robertmaxrees> b-lew that should be fine.
[17:48:04] <robertmaxrees> acidjazz if you give the browser the markup, it will download it.
[17:48:33] <acidjazz> well thast a bummer
[17:49:02] <robertmaxrees> ... dunno how that's any different from your problem earlier.
[17:49:08] <robertmaxrees> create the elements on the fly.
[17:49:37] <b-lew> would something like this work? http://jsfiddle.net/p0g2dctx/1/
[17:50:11] <robertmaxrees> .live() was removed in 1.9
[17:50:18] <robertmaxrees> you want the delegated version of .on()
[17:50:35] <acidjazz> .dong()
[17:50:49] <b-lew> well, I know that .live worked for me when trying to use it with a .clone()
[17:50:59] <robertmaxrees> b-lew .live() is deprecated.
[17:51:06] <acidjazz> hmm darn.. was hoping to control this all with media queries
[17:51:18] <robertmaxrees> and has been replaced with .on()
[17:51:32] <acidjazz> b-lew: he was fired
[17:52:03] <b-lew> haha fair enough
[17:52:03] <b-lew> thanks
[17:52:06] <b-lew> on works too
[17:52:08] <robertmaxrees> if it's still working with your code, then you're using a version of jquery that's older than 1.9
[17:52:15] <b-lew> now just need to get the data-attr to toggle
[17:52:19] <robertmaxrees> you likely want the delegated syntax though - http://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events
[17:52:31] <acidjazz> so now if im creaitng the elemnts injquery.. i need jquery to detect mobile/nonmobile
[17:52:42] <robertmaxrees> acidjazz yep.
[17:53:49] <acidjazz> robertmaxrees: how do i add a custo element as a child and giv eit attributes?
[17:53:53] <acidjazz> i guess ill gogle this
[17:53:58] <b-lew> robertmaxrees: how do I go about toggling the text? can I do a .toggle on .data?
[17:54:02] <b-lew> I'm a little lost on that part
[17:54:08] <robertmaxrees> lots of ways.
[17:54:13] <robertmaxrees> $('<span>', {text: 'some text'});
[17:54:28] <robertmaxrees> $('<span>', {text: 'some text', class: 'someClass'}); etc
[17:54:39] <acidjazz> is tha tfo rme?
[17:54:43] <robertmaxrees> yes
[17:54:50] <acidjazz> go dwha tis wrong /w my internet
[17:54:58] <BillCriswell> You have to quote class.
[17:55:04] <acidjazz> OH im uplaoding to git
[17:55:09] <robertmaxrees> ah, yeah you probably have to quote those.
[17:55:10] <acidjazz> the video files :)
[17:55:30] <acidjazz> robertmaxrees: then how do i give spam tro a father element?
[17:55:35] <acidjazz> .append() ?
[17:55:45] <robertmaxrees> yep
[17:56:57] <b-lew> grrrr
[17:59:26] <acidjazz> robertmaxrees: think i got it https://gist.github.com/acidjazz/c6a16e42cc9e8e9826b8
[17:59:46] <acidjazz> no i forgot $()
[18:00:04] <b-lew> robertmaxrees: that toggles every 2 clicks for some reason
[18:00:31] <robertmaxrees> acidjazz you're repeating work - you can create one node and then run a .clone() and edit the clones instead.
[18:00:41] <robertmaxrees> b-lew show me the code.
[18:01:09] <acidjazz> robertmaxrees: why cuz im appending 2?
[18:01:21] <robertmaxrees> you're appending basically the same thing twice.
[18:01:37] <robertmaxrees> negligible difference in perf either way.
[18:02:33] <acidjazz> im apppending two differne formats
[18:02:38] <acidjazz> mp4 and webm
[18:02:58] <robertmaxrees> right - i'm being overly specific and pedantic.
[18:03:45] <acidjazz> yea what are ou some kind of programmer? :)
[18:03:49] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[18:04:19] <acidjazz> can i chain .append?
[18:04:44] <robertmaxrees> i don't remember which object .append() returns.
[18:04:46] <robertmaxrees> i'd test it.
[18:04:58] <robertmaxrees> i know you can, just dunno if it'll be what you expect.
[18:05:11] <acidjazz> i can loop through ['webm','mp4']
[18:05:11] <acidjazz> heh
[18:05:23] <robertmaxrees> yeah i wouldn't worry about it.
[18:06:19] <acidjazz> cool
[18:06:21] <acidjazz> phone isnt grabbing it
[18:06:45] <acidjazz> man github needs to upgrade their servers
[18:06:49] <acidjazz> Writing objects:  82% (33/40), 94.86 MiB | 97.00 KiB/s
[18:06:50] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[18:06:50] <acidjazz> this is ridiculous
[18:06:57] <robertmaxrees> O.o
[18:07:05] <robertmaxrees> that's a lot of stuff to store in your VCS
[18:07:21] <acidjazz> yea too late to seperate CDN material for now
[18:07:38] <robertmaxrees> i'd just slap 'em anywhere else really.
[18:07:56] <acidjazz> meh.. one time thing
[18:14:15] <aoeu256>  how do i use css to tell jquery mobile to keep everything in one page (no vertical scrolling)
[18:14:32] <robertmaxrees> you... don't?
[18:43:14] <alexclark_> aoeu256: url?
[19:35:39] <uncovery> hey guys... if I wanted to change the "value" in a <input type="hidden" name="x" value="z"> with jquery, what would I need to do?
[19:40:36] <goddard> for some reason I can't set my div using hide() or show()
[19:42:05] <alexclark_> uncovery: http://api.jquery.com/val/#val2
[19:42:12] <uncovery> thanks!
[19:42:24] <alexclark_> goddard: set your div?
[19:42:32] <alexclark_> uncovery: no sweat
[19:42:59] <uncovery> alexclark_: how do you know my office is freezing?
[19:43:31] <alexclark_> uncovery: duh dun duh tsh
[19:44:01] <uncovery> :D I am the next john steward!
[19:44:14] <goddard> alexclark_ yeah im using page show
[19:44:26] <goddard> so the div is show() or hide()
[19:45:23] <alexclark_> goddard: oh jquery mobile stuff?
[19:45:43] <goddard> alexclark_ yeah
[19:47:04] <goddard> alexclark_ i know it is processing the function just not hiding the buttons
[19:47:25] <goddard> $('.start-it').css('visible'); returns []
[19:47:34] <alexclark_> goddard: sorry, thats not not in my wheelhouse
[19:48:30] <goddard> why would $('.start-it') return []
[19:58:04] <x0d> I'm having overflow issues from cssmenus atop of any region that uses jquery below it, that should otherwise be visible
[20:00:22] <x0d> almost feels like a z-index issue
[20:00:29] <x0d> but I know better than that =-p
[20:00:33] <x0d> (hopefully)
[20:21:28] <x0d> yup, position: relative; *die!!*
[21:15:29] <Buzzyboy> >_>
[21:15:29] <Buzzyboy> <_<
[22:18:38] <Mark_2> does anybody know how to create tab bar using jquery?
[22:27:09] <qihao> you could use jqueryui to make a tab easily
[22:29:48] <Mark_2> can you give me an example?
[22:30:37] <Mark_2> nvm, i fount one
[22:30:39] <Mark_2> *found
[22:38:30] <wa5ted> so bored
[23:12:05] <johnnyEnglish> Hey could someone explain to me the difference between these two: http://jsbin.com/widoqeloko/1/edit?js
[23:12:22] <johnnyEnglish> one has the .on() function inside another
[23:12:32] <johnnyEnglish> which is better?
[23:15:30] <Cork> johnnyEnglish: the first one is pointless as you add the event handler over and over again
[23:15:47] <Cork> so you will fire overlay 'remove') multiple times after a little while
[23:16:08] <Cork> johnnyEnglish: the second one just adds it once, and is what you should do
[23:17:35] <johnnyEnglish> I see. cheers. Yeah, i understood that.
