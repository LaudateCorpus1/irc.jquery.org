[02:35:57] <hellyeah> yo
[03:31:43] <bjorngi> hellno!
[05:04:41] <DreamStiffler> hi i have a script that i cant change much, a .keypress to check whether the keypress is valid for email or not.
[05:05:18] <DreamStiffler> is this just it?
[05:06:59] <DreamStiffler> [A-Z0-9a-z@]
[05:18:07] <r3ply> emails can contain dots
[05:38:11] <Cork> DreamStiffler: why not just add a required attribute to the field?
[05:38:42] <Cork> DreamStiffler: btw, do't use keypress, use on('input'
[05:39:10] <Cork> *don't
[05:51:29] <DreamStiffler> Cork: thats the issue, i need to change it still using keypress...btw why not?
[05:54:28] <sigdk> hello, any hint for this: https://jsfiddle.net/L6Lew2je/1/  ? Why do I get all these errors at console?
[05:56:12] <Cork> DreamStiffler: keypress isn't triggered on input, keypress isn't crossbrowser (or a standard event for that matter)
[05:56:58] <Cork> uh,, triggered on paste i meant >_<'
[05:57:22] <sigdk> well, I fixed my errors but the output is not what I'd expect: https://jsfiddle.net/L6Lew2je/2/
[05:57:26] <Cork> sigdk: you can't load http from an https site
[05:57:51] <sigdk> Cork, yeah, that's right. I fixed the url
[05:58:14] <Cork> you also don't have cors headers on nominatim so you can't ajax call it
[05:58:14] <sigdk> but see my output here: https://jsfiddle.net/L6Lew2je/2/
[05:59:09] <sigdk> Cork, cors headers?
[05:59:28] <Cork> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Access_control_CORS
[05:59:47] <Cork> it means you have default security from that site, meaning only it self can make ajax calls to it
[06:10:26] <DreamStiffler> Cork: o ('#id').on("keypress". function(event) {...<---this you mean?
[06:10:40] <Cork> no
[06:10:52] <Cork> $('#id').on('input', function(event) {})
[06:11:15] <Cork> DreamStiffler: if you want to read up on it https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/input
[06:14:40] <DreamStiffler> thanks Cork , btw wierd regex for chrome doesnt need backpace to be included but not for mozilla
[06:15:17] <Cork> DreamStiffler: most likely cause you're using a non-standard keypress event
[06:15:32] <DreamStiffler> ok lemme see
[06:15:41] <Cork> it is a legacy compatibility event for old ie < 6
[06:16:00] <Cork> (opera never supported it for example)
[06:30:06] <sigdk> okay, what is the difference between: $.ajax({ ... }).done(function(data) {console.log("hello world!")});    and $.ajax({ success: function(data) { console.log("hello world")} });   ?
[07:06:02] <rddd> hi there, I am having a problem with a selector, could someone just tell me common reasons why selectors wouldn't work? I have a table with some rows having a data attribute (data-id), and $('tr[data-id]').length keeps returning 0 even though there are definitely multiple rows with that attribute
[07:09:57] <Cork> rddd: how are you adding the value to the element?
[07:10:26] <rddd> it's hard coded into the table
[07:10:34] <rddd> I think I just spotted what I'm doing wrong haha
[07:10:38] <Cork> so it is inside the html?
[07:10:45] <rddd> this particular selector isn't wrapped in document.ready
[07:13:05] <rddd> haha yea I got it silly me cheers
[07:14:18] <sigdk> any idea why an ajax request would return me the html code of the current page?
[07:17:07] <chipyy> hey, http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2507030/email-validation-using-jquery post 127 on this site
[07:17:29] <chipyy> if( !validateEmail(emailaddress)) { /* do stuff here */ } <- that will activate when email is not valid right?
[07:22:14] <chipyy> i got it, no need for help anymore :)
[07:44:33] <Cork> sigdk: it wouldn't
[07:44:56] <chipyy> if(!password.match(^(?=.*[0-9]+.*)(?=.*[a-zA-Z]+.*)[0-9a-zA-Z]{6,31}$)) <- what is wrong here?
[07:45:17] <chipyy> i want to check if password dont match to this regex
[07:45:38] <Cork> it isn't regex
[07:45:43] <Cork> you're missing the //
[07:46:22] <chipyy> if(!password.match(/^(?=.*[0-9]+.*)(?=.*[a-zA-Z]+.*)[0-9a-zA-Z]{6,31}$/))
[07:46:33] <chipyy> that should be ok now, tnx. i will test now :)
[07:46:33] <Cork> chipyy: also you prob want to use //.test()
[07:46:39] <Cork> as match returns the matches
[07:46:55] <Cork> so you would have to do something like password.match(/^(?=.*[0-9]+.*)(?=.*[a-zA-Z]+.*)[0-9a-zA-Z]{6,31}$/).length > 0
[07:47:40] <Cork> so if(!/^(?=.*[0-9]+.*)(?=.*[a-zA-Z]+.*)[0-9a-zA-Z]{6,31}$/.test(password)) {}
[07:54:11] <chipyy> Cork, tnx anyway my regex is already working ;)
[07:55:06] <Cork> chipyy: ya, possibly but it is quite waistful to use match when you only want to test it
[07:55:17] <Cork> so i would still recommend using .test
[07:56:50] <chipyy> i match so i can write warning message , if is ok it goes to next else if
[07:57:09] <Cork> chipyy: ya, but that isn't want match is for
[07:57:18] <Cork> match is to grab the matching content from the variable
[07:57:25] <Cork> you don't want that, so match is waistfull
[07:57:58] <Cork> and why i pointed at .test()
[07:58:03] <chipyy> ah,ok. so i change match to test
[07:58:25] <Cork> .test is on regex so you have to invert the argument order
[07:58:31] <Cork> (regex.test(string))
[07:58:36] <Cork> but yes
[08:13:56] <rddd> I have a collection of <TR>s in a variable called $rows, console.log shows it looking normal, the object has the JQuery functions like children() but using $rows.children() just keeps saying TypeError: $rows.children is not a function...
[08:14:47] <rddd> if I use .find('tr') it says 'tr' is not a function...
[08:14:55] <rddd> wierd
[08:16:33] <rddd> ohhh no worries I see it
[08:16:43] <AdamPDotty> you are welcome
[09:45:55] <Kadigan> Hey. I was wondering -- when I bind("paste", function(){...}), I can get the pasted data from e.originalEvent.clipboardData.getData("Text"). But is there a way I could put something back in there? What I want to do is to replace specific strings on-the-fly, so that I can copy ex. "sftp://someone@server/path/to/file.jpg" and end up pasting "/static/path/to/file.jpg" instead.
[09:46:39] <Kadigan> (I'm copying from an SFTP client, so can't control what is put into the clipboard)
[09:47:21] <Kadigan> I assume I would have to stopPropagation() on the event, and then return with an event of my own?
[09:50:23] <chipyy> http://pastebin.com/E2nCEKjZ <- how couldi check if test passes ?
[09:50:29] <chipyy> this with TRUE isnt ok:)
[09:54:29] <chipyy> ?
[09:55:17] <cannap> sure
[09:55:26] <cannap> then you regex is wrong
[09:55:26] <Cork> chipyy: TRUE should be true
[09:55:50] <chipyy> regex is 100% true ;)
[09:55:56] <cannap> then you need more tests around this test to test the test is correct
[09:55:57] <chipyy> correct* for my use
[09:56:30] <cannap> what are you testing
[09:56:42] <cannap> because i cant paint regex
[09:57:26] <cannap> wait this one
[09:57:35] <cannap> you check for uppeCase lower and numbers
[09:57:53] <cannap> and min 6 and max 31
[09:58:06] <cannap> lol
[09:58:20] <cannap> i hope you check the same on the server
[09:58:52] <Cork> chipyy: https://jsfiddle.net/od7L1k8e/
[09:58:56] <Cork> so your code looks fine
[09:59:12] <Cork> the problem is most likely else where
[09:59:12] <cannap> damn jquery inception
[09:59:17] <cannap> :D
[09:59:22] <chipyy> i have somewhere else mistake, goddamet..
[10:00:01] <Cork> chipyy: just make sure to remove the === TRUE part of your code
[10:00:16] <kegster> so i'm looking for something similar to onepagescroll (the iphone 5 website), but i want to have areas above and below the "snap scrolling" that scroll normal. does this make sense to anyone, and/or does anyone have any pointers, ideas, or libraries in mind? the closest thing i found is this: http://wtm.github.io/jquery.snapscroll/ -- but it doesn't properly work on trackpad scrolling
[10:00:26] <chipyy> yes, its not problem in this if its somewhere else..
[10:00:51] <Cork> chipyy: and for future reference, make a jsfiddle when you suspect something is wanky
[10:01:00] <Cork> it makes it much easier to rule out causes (for your self)
[10:02:24] <Kadigan> Okay, I managed to get it working via a workaround: instead of altering what is being pasted, I prevent the paste, find the cursor, inject my changed text, and position cursor right after it. Did I miss a less involved and roundabout way of replacing strings within the clipboard on paste?
[10:21:02] <chipyy> could somebody take a look, because i dont see any reason why that shouldnt work http://pastebin.com/i7Y9yRNY
[10:25:19] * AdamPDotty suggests a look at "early return"
[10:26:08] <chipyy> i will change if with else if
[10:26:32] <AdamPDotty> next is "jquery and chaining"
[10:28:29] <AdamPDotty> hmm, is the returned data really a short string?
[10:31:19] <AdamPDotty> I do not do AJAX regularly, but shouldn't it be var result = $.parseJSON(data);
[10:31:33] <AdamPDotty> most people here complain about invalid json after AJAX :-)
[10:32:17] <AdamPDotty> I would probably put $("#warning-message1") in a variable.
[10:32:22] <chipyy> it worked hour ago by i dont know why isnt anymore..
[10:32:43] <chipyy> it doesnt even alert me if input is empty.. but it should
[10:34:19] <chipyy> found it finaly
[10:34:29] <AdamPDotty> Have you checked network tab?
[10:34:37] <chipyy> for fu*k sake i would destroy this laptop and fuc*ing freamer
[10:34:48] <chipyy> i didnt finished previous action on other button
[10:34:57] <chipyy> so it was all together like one press on button
[10:35:10] <AdamPDotty> tststsk
[10:35:19] <chipyy> brain are talking to me now
[10:35:27] <chipyy> kill that laptop, kill that laptop
[10:35:33] <AdamPDotty> Still, I would start with making it readable.
[10:35:41] <chipyy> i lost damn one hour because of that ")};"
[10:35:51] <AdamPDotty> Will give you the right habits, too.
[10:35:54] <chipyy> i will use comments now
[10:37:09] <AdamPDotty> man "DRY"
[10:37:22] <chipyy> if i dry then i die XD
[10:37:50] <chipyy> i must take a break for few minutes :D
[10:54:08] <hackedhead> is there anything like datatables for <ul> ? sorting on tags inside the <li>s?
[11:10:54] <z1haze> anyone have any insight on how/why chrome autofill would cause a random select box to open
[11:11:47] <dunaeth> Hi, any idea on what could cause a onSubmit event handler delegated to document to not be able to stop the event as of jQuery 1.9.1 ?
[11:12:59] <dunaeth> When in the mean time, a similar delegation can (this time the form is loaded after the page load, when the first was loaded with the page)
[11:13:27] <amundir> how are you binding the submit handler?
[11:13:30] <dunaeth> Changing document with body for the first case allow me to stop the event
[11:13:36] <z1haze> https://gyazo.com/d2141e5a19e186e7f348c6d3d1f23220
[11:13:40] <z1haze> any thoughts just on the visual?
[11:13:50] <z1haze> very bizzare, no code is firing, i mean in chrome auto fill
[11:14:07] <dunaeth> amundir $(document).on('submit', 'form', function(e) {[...]});
[11:14:40] <amundir> but you say body works?
[11:14:48] <dunaeth> $('body')
[11:14:50] <dunaeth> yup
[11:15:05] <dunaeth> That sounds weird :)
[11:15:14] <amundir> interesting.  did you put a console log in the former to see if it is even firing?
[11:16:20] <dunaeth> the first is not, the second is fired
[11:16:35] <amundir> so it may be that the submit event is allowed to bubble up to the body and no further
[11:17:14] <dunaeth> Hmmm, in fact when thinking about that, I'm thinking about a third party lib that could mess up the event bubbling
[11:17:19] <dunaeth> like parsley
[11:18:33] <dunaeth> ok, actually it was simply an off from a coworker -_-
[12:20:40] * taplar *beatboxes* token!
[12:37:58] <merkazu> when would $.when be useful? I'm looking for actual examples
[12:38:20] <taplar> you're executing n number of ajax calls at the same time
[12:38:25] <taplar> and you want to do something after they are all done
[12:39:21] <merkazu> but what would require multiple ajax calls and all need to be loaded before a function executes?
[12:39:37] <taplar> *shrug*
[12:39:41] <taplar> business specific
[12:40:14] <merkazu> yeah, that's my problem, i just can't see a real life scenario where that's useful
[12:41:01] <taplar> maybe you have a user logged in and they go to a page to see their orders, which the page is segregated into pending orders and past orders.
[12:41:15] <taplar> maybe you want to do an ajax call for both of them and don't put either to the page until they are both done
[12:42:53] <taplar> or maybe you have a file upload screen capable of uploading multiple files at once
[12:43:01] <taplar> once they are all done, you want to show a complete message
[12:43:22] <merkazu> okay, now that one actually makes sense to me
[12:43:31] * taplar scores
[12:46:44] <new_to_json> Hey taplar, sorry I had to shoot out last night, but look what I got working! https://jsfiddle.net/5vzzrn33/26/
[12:47:17] <taplar> booya, :)
[12:48:49] <new_to_json> Yeah I was looking at it with a buddy explaining step by step, and then it hit me I was like "This overwrites the value of "X"  and then it hit me like a brick
[12:49:40] <taplar> what do you mean?
[12:51:08] <new_to_json> So on the old code around line 57, I recreated my 'x' array and that overwrote it
[12:51:21] <taplar> oh, you had a var there?
[12:52:08] <taplar> line 57 is the json in the fiddle
[12:52:12] <new_to_json> Yup I moved it up to where I defined my index[1] and [2]
[12:52:22] <new_to_json> line 57 on my code, not the jsfiddle
[12:53:08] <taplar> how is index1 different from i?
[12:53:37] <new_to_json> http://pastebin.com/0eAexM7F if you look here it's on 77
[12:54:02] <taplar> that's the old code man
[12:54:06] <new_to_json> I know
[12:54:07] <taplar> in the fiddle
[12:54:12] <new_to_json> Im just showing you what line
[12:54:14] <taplar> how is index1 different from i?
[12:54:43] <new_to_json> I went into the lop and starting running the code for the category map
[12:55:44] <new_to_json> then to build up my category array, i made "x" then use the array x[index1[ to hold each value in the category
[12:55:47] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/5vzzrn33/27/ <-- look at the console
[12:56:21] <taplar> you're starting index1 off as 0 and incrementing it at the end each time
[12:56:27] <taplar> that's exactly what 'i' is
[12:57:56] <new_to_json> but it bumps up index[2] each time as well
[12:58:18] <taplar> which is completely unrelated to index1 being === to i, :)
[12:58:55] <new_to_json> I'm using it to incremement though, but yet
[12:58:57] <new_to_json> ye
[12:59:34] <taplar> you don't need it though.  you could rename i everywhere to index1, get rid of your var index1 and it should still work
[12:59:42] <taplar> without the unnecessary extra variable
[13:00:16] <new_to_json> Awesome, will do! thanks for the explanation!
[13:00:31] <taplar> yup, also what's with calling loadBoard and stuff outside of the ajax?
[13:02:17] <new_to_json> on the fiddle?
[13:02:22] <taplar> yep
[13:03:02] <new_to_json> The AJAX is just pulling the questions but the board is being created after the fact
[13:03:30] <taplar> right, it creates it when the ajax is done by the method in the then()
[13:03:51] <taplar> calling it outside the ajax, you can't guarentee that the ajax is done and that you have data
[13:04:00] <taplar> data doesn't even exist outside of the then()
[13:04:33] <robertmaxrees> ^^^^^^
[13:06:38] <taplar> i forget if i mentioned it yesterday or not, but the reason you want to do it this way is because this is the paradigm of async behavior
[13:06:59] <taplar> before you were doing async: 'false' which is not a recommended practice, and it has also been removed from the latest version of jquery
[13:07:05] <robertmaxrees> putting code after an ajax call doesn't mean it actually runs after the ajax call is all done.
[13:08:48] <Dan39> kind of having trouble thinking of how to explain this question... when im in a function triggered by an event, is the DOM like a representation of when that even was triggered, or will it be changing?
[13:09:01] <robertmaxrees> what it was triggered.
[13:09:12] <robertmaxrees> *when\
[13:09:16] <Dan39> hmm
[13:09:38] <robertmaxrees> what's the actual problem you're having?
[13:09:45] <Dan39> im writing that now
[13:09:47] <Dan39> :)
[13:09:55] <taplar> your creating a problem? :O
[13:10:03] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:10:14] <robertmaxrees> i mean, the only code with no bugs is the code that doesn't get written, sooo
[13:10:22] <taplar> lol
[13:10:39] <taplar> *shakes his etch-a-sketch*  there, debugged
[13:11:24] <robertmaxrees> *boom*
[13:12:22] <robertmaxrees> i'm looking at a little microservice i wrote that sits as an intermediary between our sites and an API we use.  I didn't realize how much traffic it's handling.
[13:12:48] <robertmaxrees> almost 1.5 million requests over the last 24 hours.
[13:12:51] <taplar> what does it do?  like a translator?
[13:13:22] <robertmaxrees> sort of, yeah.  simplifies the API and strips out a ton of data we don't need.
[13:13:59] <Dan39> i just typed a very long thing that i dunno... 1 last question first
[13:14:21] <Dan39> im using a jquery-ui modal dialog
[13:14:42] <Dan39> the close call, is that run before or fater the dialog is closed?
[13:14:49] <Dan39> after... -_-
[13:14:52] <Dan39> *
[13:15:10] <robertmaxrees> what's the problelm that you're having?
[13:15:25] <taplar> http://api.jqueryui.com/dialog/#event-close
[13:15:26] <Dan39> shit i just saw in api there is also beforeClose()
[13:15:33] <robertmaxrees> heh
[13:15:39] <Dan39> but anyways
[13:16:24] <Dan39> i have some code on the $(document).click that "deselects" a "selected" tr when you click outside of the tr. all working pretty simply how I would want, but i dont want the tr to be deselected when I click a certain button that brings up a modal dialog and am clicking around the modal, which i have working, and the click() function checks that dialogs arent open, but when i click the close X or cancel button
[13:16:27] <Dan39> of modal, the click function thinks the modal is no longer open...
[13:17:02] <robertmaxrees> sounds like you're overcomlicating something.
[13:17:16] <robertmaxrees> you have code you want to run unless a particular child element is clicked, yeah?
[13:17:55] <new_to_json> Ah, sorry got pulled aside. I have to learn more about async
[13:18:19] <robertmaxrees> new_to_json pretty basic idea - effectively, you have to tell the async code what to do when it's done.
[13:18:23] <taplar> http://learn.jquery.com/ajax/
[13:18:32] <robertmaxrees> instead of just putting code after the async stuff.
[13:18:43] <Dan39> robertmaxrees: hmm
[13:18:53] <robertmaxrees> Dan39 is that the case?
[13:19:10] <Dan39> robertmaxrees: yes, but also unless a modal is open
[13:19:27] <robertmaxrees> Dan39 okay, that's pretty easy.
[13:20:03] <Dan39> yes its mostly working
[13:20:23] <robertmaxrees> there are two ways to cover this.  one way is to see which element initiated the event and test if that.closest('.theElement').length
[13:20:29] <Dan39> i do that
[13:20:35] <Dan39> like i said, i have that work
[13:20:38] <robertmaxrees> so then where's the problem?
[13:20:51] <Dan39> on $(document).click i have
[13:20:53] <Dan39> if (!$(event.target).closest("#users_table td").length) {
[13:20:56] <Dan39>             $("#users_table tr").removeClass("selected");
[13:21:12] <robertmaxrees> woah.
[13:21:22] <Dan39> robertmaxrees: ...
[13:21:31] <robertmaxrees> don't paste multiple lines of code in the channel :)  make a fiddle or something instead :D
[13:21:38] <Dan39> o polease
[13:21:39] <Dan39> its 2 lines
[13:21:44] <Dan39> i could have made it 1
[13:21:48] <robertmaxrees> *sigh*
[13:21:50] <robertmaxrees> good luck then.
[13:21:52] <taplar> still hard to read
[13:21:56] <Dan39> ok ok sorry
[13:22:01] <robertmaxrees> heh
[13:22:12] <robertmaxrees> plus a functioning test case is always preferred
[13:22:14] <Dan39> if you want a fiddle then thats easy enough
[13:22:29] <Dan39> but would take me a little while
[13:22:34] <Dan39> moving on...
[13:22:35] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:22:47] <Dan39> that works as i would like
[13:22:48] <robertmaxrees> then what's your problem, then?
[13:23:14] <Dan39> when a modal is open i dont want that run
[13:23:37] <Dan39> which i have working...
[13:24:07] <robertmaxrees> lol you keep telling us things that are working correctly but not the thing that isn't working.
[13:24:10] <Dan39> but when i click Cancel or the X at top right to close the modal... the click event says there is no modals open
[13:24:37] <Dan39> so how do i avoid the code running when i click that X or cancel button that closes the modal...
[13:25:02] <robertmaxrees> use a delegated listener on the modal container and add another check for the close button.
[13:25:21] <robertmaxrees> or use beforeclose like taplar suggested.
[13:25:52] <robertmaxrees> though that can't really be listened for the the handler you're currently using I'm guessing.
[13:25:57] <Dan39> ill see if i can throw together a fiddle quickly
[13:26:34] <robertmaxrees> but yeah, i'd use a delegated event listener here.
[13:27:49] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:27:55] <robertmaxrees> woops wrong window.
[13:28:11] <Dan39> now i need to know
[13:28:18] <Dan39> what are you laughing at? -_-
[13:28:21] <robertmaxrees> not you haha
[13:28:28] <robertmaxrees> was reading something a coworker sent me.
[13:31:37] <robertmaxrees> Dan39 https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/g4Lpoa8v/
[13:48:40] <Dan39> robertmaxrees: i think working off that i can just add in a stopImmediatePropagation() to stop the window click from running then... if it works like i hope and the more specific click even gets run before the document.click
[13:48:53] <Dan39> event*
[13:55:13] <taplar> my ccleaner just popped up saying i needed to clean some space and i would save 666MB of space, with a red background on the modal.  not, uh, very friendly
[13:56:00] <Dan39> hmm
[13:56:18] <Dan39> anyone know how to get jquery-ui working in jsfiddle?
[13:56:34] <Dan39> i think the included extension option has no style
[13:57:44] <chipyy> Hey, could somebody paste me any good regex for names, Which can contain utf8 letters and ' and - ? :)
[13:59:40] <taplar> alpha characters and ' and - ?
[13:59:54] <snover> https://www.kalzumeus.com/2010/06/17/falsehoods-programmers-believe-about-names/
[14:01:18] <chipyy> taplar : žćđšđć
[14:01:26] <chipyy> this i mean with utf8
[14:01:49] <taplar> heh, dunno how to do that with regex
[14:01:52] <chipyy> i found this: ^([a-zA-Z\u0080-\u024F]+(?:. |-| |'))*[a-zA-Z\u0080-\u024F]*$   but dont know how to test it
[14:02:06] <snover> please read the article i linked and stop trying to “validate” names with a regular expression
[14:02:08] <chipyy> if i copy paste in http://regexr.com/ doesnt work
[14:04:44] <chipyy> snover your article doesnt help me nothing..
[14:09:59] <snover> validating names with a regular expression is wrong. the solution is to not do the wrong thing you are trying to do.
[14:10:18] <chipyy> i know about that..
[14:10:43] <chipyy> because of that name can contain letters + " ' " and "- "
[14:11:10] <snover> wrong.
[14:11:49] <Dan39> robertmaxrees: welcome back
[14:11:52] <chipyy> now explain me why???
[14:12:10] <chipyy> john's , mubarak-johanson ,...
[14:12:15] <chipyy> so whats wrong here
[14:12:39] <chipyy> and i dont look for other countries just my atm
[14:12:49] <chipyy> and that is Slovenia
[14:12:56] <snover> does your country have no immigrants?
[14:14:32] <chipyy> immigrants wont be on my site :)
[14:14:37] <Dan39> robertmaxrees: i got the working fiddle.... now, when you click "No" or the X to close the modal, i dont want it to deselect the tr... http://jsfiddle.net/ddan39/h3zjeh40/13/
[14:14:58] <chipyy> what i am doing wrong here: name.search(/([a-zA-Z\u0080-\u024F]+(?:. |-| |'))*[a-zA-Z\u0080-\u024F]/g)
[14:15:02] <robertmaxrees> Dan39 did you look at the fiddle I sent earlier?
[14:15:06] <Dan39> yes
[14:15:14] <Dan39> i had replied but maybe you timed out already
[14:15:23] <Dan39> robertmaxrees: i think working off that i can just add in a stopImmediatePropagation() to stop the window click from running then... if it works like i hope and the more specific click even gets run before the document.click
[14:16:12] <snover> i have already told you what you are doing wrong multiple times. the correct regular expression for a name is .*
[14:16:16] <robertmaxrees> sorry, in a meeting Dan39.
[14:16:26] <Dan39> heh
[14:16:52] <robertmaxrees> ;) but it should be pretty straightforward.
[14:16:59] <robertmaxrees> you just need to add two checks to that conditional.
[14:17:19] <chipyy> snower, you are just saying its incorrect.. and thats wrong.
[14:17:37] <chipyy> so if you could be more precise or repair my upper code
[14:17:58] <Dan39> ha
[14:20:01] <robertmeeting> sorry man.
[14:20:06] <robertmeeting> been a crazy few weeks haha
[14:37:29] <chipyy> #red !important <- that works
[14:37:45] <chipyy> #fdfdfd !important <- that wont work
[14:37:59] <chipyy> why that? anyone has fix for this?
[14:38:17] <taplar> other than those two lines, i have no context for your question
[14:38:33] <chipyy> button.my-account:active{ 	color:red!important; 	background-color:#fdfdfd!important; 	}
[14:38:44] <snover> “#red” is not valid and you should never use !important.
[14:38:47] <chipyy> color works, background doesnt work
[14:39:05] <chipyy> if i change background to red !important that works
[14:40:05] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/h9eegrz0/
[14:40:28] <frankiee_> chipyy: https://css-tricks.com/reduced-test-cases/
[14:40:34] <frankiee_> follow taplar's lead
[14:41:30] <chipyy> i dont want to add style to element
[14:41:38] <chipyy> because i have one css for all :)
[14:41:48] <taplar> you're failing to see the point of that
[14:42:00] <Dan39> NEVER use !important? :P
[14:42:11] <taplar> well, that's true
[14:42:14] <taplar> but no, :)
[14:42:25] <chipyy> in this case i must, to run over bootstrap
[14:42:42] <snover> Dan39: !important is the h-bomb of css selectors. everyone’s lives are better if the missiles stay in their silos. :)
[14:43:11] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/h9eegrz0/2/ works fine
[14:43:20] <taplar> it's green when you have it held down
[14:43:40] <arc_> whichever css file is loaded last will have priority
[14:43:50] <taplar> or the most granular selector
[14:43:50] <arc_> you don't need to use !important to override default style from bootstrap
[14:44:39] <snover> arc_: not quite… the selector with the highest specificity wins; only in cases where you have selectors with the same specificity will selectors later in source override earlier ones
[14:44:48] <taplar> ^
[14:45:08] <taplar> with inlines being the king
[14:45:09] <chipyy> fixed
[14:45:25] <chipyy> and i had also same background so i couldnt see changes :D
[14:45:35] <chipyy> and !important must have free space before
[14:45:52] <taplar> must?  my example doesn't
[14:45:57] <taplar> lol
[14:46:07] <hellyeah> yo
[14:46:30] <taplar> aloha
[14:47:49] <hellyeah> sup taplar?
[14:48:00] <taplar> fixing stuff i broke.  another day in paradise
[14:49:05] <hellyeah> i am really carious you have hard time on programming. You look vert good at programming
[14:49:31] <taplar> not everything is simple.  and no one is perfect, :)
[14:49:42] <taplar> which is why tests are important, ;)
[14:49:55] <hellyeah> unit test
[14:50:00] <hellyeah> i may have a new job soon
[14:50:05] <taplar> unit & functional
[14:50:13] <taplar> that's cool
[14:52:41] <Dan39> is doing a listener like this bad? effect performance a lot or something? it just seems too easy... $(document).on("click", ".ui-dialog-titlebar-close,.ui-button", fun);
[14:52:54] <taplar> if possible bind lower
[14:53:03] <Dan39> hmmm
[14:53:10] <taplar> generally speaking with delegates you want to bind as low as possible
[14:53:37] <Dan39> the one dialog i am creating i am creating dynamically like $("<div><p>hello</p></div>").dialog()
[14:53:52] <frankiee_> $(document).on('pagecontainerbeforeshow', function() {?
[14:54:01] <taplar> and you are attaching it to the page how?
[14:54:03] <frankiee_> $(document).on('pagecontainershow', function() {?
[14:54:03] <Dan39> i will have to look where that even shows up within DOM
[14:54:16] <Dan39> taplar: just like that
[14:54:24] <Dan39> dialog() opens it as a modal
[14:54:26] <taplar> oh, so dialog() is doing the attaching
[14:54:37] <Dan39> let me see where it appends it...
[14:54:41] <taplar> which is probably just in the body some where.  so you'll probably have to attach to body
[14:54:55] <taplar> attach = bind
[14:55:24] <Dan39> its just in the body
[14:55:36] <taplar> ya, so you can bind to body
[14:55:39] <Dan39> so i guess i can do $("body").on(
[14:55:55] <Dan39> is that much better than $(document) haha
[14:56:01] <taplar> i like $(document.body) but ya
[14:56:08] <Dan39> ah
[14:56:10] <Dan39> sure
[14:57:58] <Dan39> im new and to make it easy have been sticking to mostly jquery for most things even though i know some are doing it with non-jquery pure dom things like that
[14:58:30] <Dan39> i wonder sometimes if a lot of it is still neccessary now that i wont even support old browsers
[14:59:23] <taplar> *shrug* it's just the pendulum i suppose.  you learn jquery and for a while you think that jquery should do everything
[14:59:31] <taplar> then you start backing off
[15:02:15] <user_corrupt> I have the following AJAX: https://paste.ee/p/caTch that is posting to the following PHP: https://paste.ee/p/1DiP0 I know that the variables are getting posted and that my database queries are working, because I see them as return values in an array in my debugger. The problem is that I can't get any kind of response to work inside the callback - console.log(data);
[15:03:46] <taplar> doesn't look like your returning json
[15:04:13] <taplar> you want to echo json_encode($array);
[15:05:39] <arc_> snover i know but presumably he is trying to directly override the same selector
[15:06:41] <taplar> arc_: sure, but by saying the most granular one takes precedence infers that you just have to make a more granular rule instead of using !important
[15:07:27] <taplar> instead of relying on script load order
[15:07:34] <totallyserious> https://gist.github.com/vicngtor/57f5ade20665c44e738fc1bbb266e796 Can soemone tell me why the second declaration of $.onVisible always gets an infinite loop?
[15:09:03] <totallyserious> oh it's because the timer is a global variable
[15:15:27] <taplar> could probably make that a bit smaller totallyserious
[15:16:27] <hellyeah> oVisible
[15:16:31] <hellyeah> is it event?
[15:17:29] <hellyeah> setTimeout inside setTimeout make sense? I am just carious

[16:57:09] <taplar> someone speaks!
[17:04:13] <morenoh149> I'm getting '$ not defined' but I thought you're supposed to wait for jquery to lead like '$(document).ready()'

[17:05:53] <taplar> jak2013: so you're wanting to hide all buttons with the same class?
[17:06:19] <jak2013> yes
[17:06:23] <jak2013> cl1 in this
[17:08:39] <Jonn``> Hello guys. I have the following problem: https://jsfiddle.net/8jr707oc/
[17:09:30] <Jonn``> Short version, I need to evaluate a variable which contains either true, false, or undefined. Such evaluation must return the value of the variable, unless it is undefined which has to return as null.
[17:09:39] <taplar> jak2013: something like this possibly http://jsfiddle.net/ajzs9doo/1/
[17:10:29] <taplar> flag === undefined ? null : flag
[17:19:27] <jak2013> taplar worked fine, thankss
[17:20:08] <jak2013> other question i havea  a div scrollable... hwhen i add some content, move to bottom, the user need move to top, how to do this with jqeury or not move,?
[17:21:00] <taplar> are you saying you want to move the scrollbar, or are you saying you want to add the new content to the top of the dif?
[17:21:04] <taplar> *div
[17:23:04] <jak2013> first
[17:23:26] <jak2013> i want move the scrollbar or when add a content to div not move the sscroll
[17:23:43] <taplar> https://api.jquery.com/scrollTop/#scrollTop2
[17:28:51] <Jonn``> taplar: Thanks. That confirms my suspicion that there is no better way ˆ_ˆ;
[17:29:45] <taplar> can't get much better than an if else, :)
[17:30:31] <jak2013> taplar accept a pm?
[17:30:40] <taplar> sure?
[17:30:49] <taplar> though if it's a question i'd prefer it in the room
[17:30:58] <taplar> *about jquery
[17:31:34] <Jonn``> Haha. My concern is that it seems redundant with a previous check that does: if (typeof flagNotUndefined === 'undefined' || typeof flagUndefined === 'undefined') { ... }
[17:32:19] <jak2013> ok
[17:32:23] <jak2013> creating a jssfiddle
[17:32:39] <taplar> Jonn``: if you wanted to get funky you could do a map
[17:32:45] <taplar> possibly
[17:33:51] <danemacmillan> Would someone here recommend triggering an event on a specific dom node like $('#myid').trigger('customEvent') or just on something general like $(document)?
[17:34:13] <danemacmillan> I typically use document. Is there some advantage one way or the other I'm not thinking about?
[17:35:16] <taplar> it depends on what your trying to do danemacmillan.  are you making some sort of a plugin?
[17:35:36] <danemacmillan> Let's say I am. I assume it would be better to use document for a plugin.
[17:35:48] <shoky> usually best to just call a function
[17:36:05] <taplar> ^ or trigger it on the elements they user initialized the plugin for
[17:36:07] <shoky> if the event is not related to a specific DOM element that your plugin works with
[17:36:36] <taplar> triggering on the document would force the users to know they have to bind that high to listen for it
[17:36:41] <taplar> which isn't very modular
[17:37:18] <Jonn``> taplar: https://jsfiddle.net/8jr707oc/2/ <--- that is my current evaluation. caseFlag1 & caseFlag2 comes from an API, in case you wonder what was the context.
[17:37:47] <taplar> Jonn``: nevermind my map idea.  it dunt work, :D
[17:38:16] <Jonn``> :-P
[17:39:19] <Jonn``> Something as simple as "set the value to myVariable unless it is `undefined`, then set it as `null`" seems so complicated.
[17:39:51] <taplar> well, just wait around for ES6 and then you can have some default parameters, :)
[17:40:50] <danemacmillan> If I triggered an event on a specific node, would I only be able to bind to it from that specific node, or could I pass it any node or event $(document)?
[17:41:02] <taplar> elements bubble, :)
[17:41:06] <jak2013> taplar: http://jsfiddle.net/jamiguel77/jrjrbrb1/1/   i want/need, user click on button, and put the value of the caption button in the first empty input and simulate blur event....
[17:41:07] <taplar> events i mean
[17:42:14] <danemacmillan> Right, so let's say I trigger an event on $('#myid').trigger('customEvent'), I could bind to any dom node beneath and including #myid, but not its parents?
[17:42:29] <taplar> only above
[17:42:38] <taplar> itself and above
[17:42:47] <taplar> bubbles float up, ;)
[17:42:58] <danemacmillan> Ah right right
[17:43:34] <taplar> jak2013: it seems to be working... ?
[17:43:40] <danemacmillan> So is there an inherent performance benefit to just triggering a custom event on $(document) where it has minimal places to bubble up?
[17:43:53] <jak2013> doneee.... http://jsfiddle.net/jamiguel77/jrjrbrb1/3/
[17:44:09] <taplar> it bubbles through less of the dom, i suppose
[17:44:25] <taplar> but again, that would force the user to bind on the document if they wanted to catch it
[17:44:42] <taplar> performance wise, as shoky mentioned, best case would be to just call a callback provided by the user
[17:44:49] <taplar> and not fire a custom event
[17:45:16] <kegster> how do i get a div "A" (and everything below it, including any other divs), once scrolled to, to begin to "slide over" all the elements above it (so the elements above the "A" div are fixated, almost)?
[17:45:19] <kegster> does that make sense? lol
[17:45:52] <danemacmillan> Callbacks wouldn't apply to the case I'm working on. There's a need for multiple un-related pieces of code that exist in different repos to be able to hook into this specific moment, so an event is very much the best choice.
[17:46:18] <kegster> the effect i'm looking for is on this site http://method.digital/ -- however the stuff above "highlights" purple div would be different content (using fullpage.js for the stuff above)
[17:46:46] <taplar> so multiple un-related peices of code are all going to be firing the same custom event?
[17:47:07] <danemacmillan> No, one will fire the event. The others will observe it, should they want to.
[17:47:34] <taplar> ah
[17:48:25] <danemacmillan> It's a textbook case for triggering the event. I wanted some clarification, though.
[17:50:13] <danemacmillan> Just so I'm clear, by triggering on $(document), the only way to listen for the custom triggered event would be to bind it to $(document) again, as trying to bind it on some random DOM node in the document will never be able to listen for it, because the triggered event from document will only bubble up, not down into the entire DOM tree?
[17:50:27] <taplar> correct
[17:51:02] <taplar> i may vaguely remember something about the ability to make events propagate in the reverse order, but I might be dreaming that too.
[17:51:37] <danemacmillan> Alright--and the inverse would be true--if I triggered on a deeply nested DOM node, I could just listen for it by binding to $(document)?
[17:51:47] <taplar> sure
[17:52:09] <danemacmillan> Okay. That clears up everything for me. Thanks!
[17:56:53] <taplar> jak2013: lol, why are you using alert() and debugger; ?
