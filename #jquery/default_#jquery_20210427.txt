[13:34:19] <auxin> I am finding it difficult to alter the number of columns of div tags [ such as $('.Music').css('columns', 4) ] and having the objects within it stay completely visible. If the columns are set to three, the container obscures one of the objects. [ screenshot: https://i.imgur.com/YI2ViGT.jpg ]
[13:35:22] <robertmaxrees> auxin sounds like a css issue maybe? :)
[13:38:31] <auxin> thank you.
[13:42:22] <auxin> also, what is a good way to change that value. incidentally I was using $(window).on('resize', function() {});
[13:42:35] <robertmaxrees> media queries in CSS.
[13:42:52] <auxin> ok, I'll try that again, that was what I attempted initially.
[13:42:56] <auxin> thanks.
