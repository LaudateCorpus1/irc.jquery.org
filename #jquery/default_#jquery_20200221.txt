[07:48:53] <Robdgreat> Bromite: do you have a question?
[07:49:04] <Robdgreat> please feel free to just ask it
[07:49:45] <Robdgreat> cutting to the chase is never considered rude :)

[23:39:06] <Woet> snackoverflow: where is the jQuery code?
[23:39:15] <robertmaxrees> ^
[23:39:50] <robertmaxrees> it's all good though - they shotgunned to at least one other channel.  so they don't need our help obviously.
[23:39:57] <snackoverflow> oh just realized there is none. most of my frontend code is jquery. but i guess not with this script
[23:40:14] <snackoverflow> s/script/function
