[04:36:44] <manners> hi guys
[04:52:20] <manners> im trying to use a jquery multi select plug in "Erichynds" to create a multi select drop down list with check boxes, the form im using has several drop downs but i only want it to apply to one of them. so i done it like this which works except when the form is posted it doesnt show <skills> as part of the array
[04:52:24] <manners> dCzJmfds
[04:54:11] <manners> sorry thats http://pastebin.com/dCzJmfds
[04:59:35] <manners> if i make it like this http://pastebin.com/L69rVHD2 then all the drop downs are attached to the plugin and all appear when the form is posted
[05:00:16] <manners> can anyone tell me how i can attach it to one drop down only and still get the results fomr the form
[05:00:29] <manners> *from
[05:09:24] <manners> anyone here?
[05:55:50] <manners> anyone here
[05:56:29] <pachet> quite a few people, i'd imagine
[05:57:13] <manners> ok anyone who can help me with an issue
[05:57:51] <manners> im trying to use this plug in
[05:57:52] <manners> http://www.erichynds.com/examples/jquery-ui-multiselect-widget/demos/#basic
[05:58:13] <manners> but for some reason my drop down shows all the options below the actual drop down
[05:58:46] <manners> can be seen here http://ir.highnamcomputers.co.uk/add_a_candidate.php
[05:59:10] <manners> what on earth am i missing
[05:59:54] <pachet> manners: looks like a CSS problem at first glance
[06:00:13] <pachet> manners: i'd ask the author directly
[06:00:35] <manners> his page is not working anymore only the demos part of it
[06:00:55] <pachet> erichynds still hangs out on freenode from time to time afaik
[06:01:01] <pachet> maybe set a pounce for him and ask
[06:01:18] <pachet> although whether he wants to support 5-year-old jqui plugins anymore is up for debate
[06:01:26] <manners> lol
[06:01:41] <manners> i will try myself for a little first as i love to learn
[06:05:19] <Pazician> manners: Hello :) I agree with pachet, looks like something is messed up with the CSS properties you got going on there. I'll take a moment and see if I can figure it out, while I do that I can give you guys a question, I'm using WordPress and a WP plugin called WooCommerce and they got a template called archive-product.php and now I want to order all the products by the category, anyone know how to do that?
[06:05:51] <Pazician> manners: Oh, well - seems like you got it
[06:06:01] <Pazician> manners: What was the problem?
[06:07:26] <manners> yup found it thanks i had the link wrong for the css sheet
[06:08:01] <manners> ok now this is a dumb question. when i select more than one i only get the last result on my post
[06:08:19] <manners> how can i get the rest into post with a seprator
[06:24:03] <BruteShot> heya
[06:24:49] <Uhkis> yo
[06:25:19] <BruteShot> It's Uhkis
[06:25:22] <BruteShot> Ermeged!
[06:25:26] <BruteShot> Can I get an autograph?
[06:25:38] <arthurvr> Hey-hey
[06:26:01] <Uhkis> dont have the url saved, sorry
[06:26:17] <BruteShot> Wait what? lol
[06:26:28] <pachet> ?wat
[06:26:49] <pachet> !wat
[06:26:53] <BruteShot> #wat
[06:26:58] <pachet> guess that trigger got removed :[
[06:27:14] <BruteShot> Oh lol, I thought we were just going bonkers on punctuation
[06:27:15] <Uhkis> BruteShot: someone else asked for it and i actually used some online paint thing  to do it :D
[06:27:16] <pachet> although i cant even remember what bot responded to that
[06:27:43] <Uhkis> ?flip
[06:27:43] <b-ot> Uhkis: (╯‵Д′)╯彡┻━┻
[06:28:09] <BruteShot> Uhkis hahaha
[06:28:33] <BruteShot> (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
[06:28:35] <BruteShot> ┻━┻︵ \(°□°)/ ︵ ┻━┻
[06:28:37] <BruteShot> ┬──┬ ノ( ゜-゜ノ)
[06:31:25] <BruteShot> so oh yeah, I had a question lol, damn you Uhkis and your animal charisma!
[06:31:54] <BruteShot> How would I go about adding a callback to a jquery function lol, it seems straighforward but I apparently can't figure it out
[06:32:50] <BruteShot> Basically I'm using the colorbox plugin's .resize() and I need to make the resize is complete before the next step, as it resizes an iframe within the cbox
[06:32:54] <BruteShot> and it's failing miserably
[06:33:45] <BruteShot> oh hey, lol, that's not even part of colorbox, .resize is straight up jq
[06:33:57] <Uhkis> ?api resize
[06:33:57] <b-ot> Uhkis: .resize(): Bind an event handler to the "resize" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/resize/
[06:34:08] <BruteShot> Yep, just read that lol
[06:34:11] <BruteShot> #headslap
[06:34:17] <BruteShot> #*foreaheadslap
[06:34:47] <BruteShot> So you all have to do me a favor, please open your log files and erase my last question, cool cool cool, thanks!
[06:34:58] <BruteShot> My agent wants this off the internet
[06:35:24] <Uhkis> BruteShot: i'm sorry but it's already on the internet
[06:36:19] <BruteShot> Yeah, but we can take it off, we have the technology!
[06:37:36] <Uhkis> BruteShot: apparently not yet, but soon! (i'm referring to http://irc.jquery.org/%23jquery/latest.log.html)
[06:38:00] <BruteShot> Gawd
[06:38:47] <BruteShot> I hate this!  I'm actually not cool with these channel logs being put online lol, on #drupal I had set a demo site for cwsmith, and I posted a user/pass, and completely forgot about the site.  I clean up my hosting a couple months later, the thing was riddles with pharma spam
[06:38:49] <keglevich> hello all... I'm working on a wordpress page and since I'm not familiar with jQuery I'd need a little help from someone (jquery guru) with sidebar vertical drop-down menu... I already have html, jquery code, and css... I'd just need a few small modifications...if someone's willing to check it out, I'd be really thankful...
[06:38:51] <BruteShot> Thank god I didn't give him uid 1
[06:40:03] <Uhkis> BruteShot: ouch
[06:40:20] <BruteShot> yeah, and when someone searches my domain, that crap shows up on google lol, it really blows
[06:40:38] <BruteShot> But the thing that annoys me is, the first post was "lel admin, you got haxed!"
[06:40:53] <BruteShot> It's like, seriously bro?  You googled it?  That's not exactly, "l33t skillz"
[06:41:26] <Uhkis> why didn't  you just change the pass after the fail? :D
[06:41:31] <BruteShot> but whatever, they never could get uid one lol, and it's funny because I'm usually so lazy with sites I set up to show someone something, this was honestly the first time I bothered to set permissions
[06:42:04] <BruteShot> What do you mean after the fail lol?  I forgot the site existed, I had only made it to show cwsmith something, and I remembered about it when I cleaned up my hosting hahaha, I just took down the site
[06:42:50] <Uhkis> so you didn't get that "oops feeling" after publicly sharing the credentials?
[06:43:03] <BruteShot> Well, not really lol
[06:43:09] <BruteShot> But I did learn a lesson :P
[06:43:13] <BruteShot> Never help people!
[06:43:14] <BruteShot> hahaha
[06:43:23] <Uhkis> lol
[06:44:47] <Uhkis> http://irc.jquery.org/%23jquery/latest.log.html#t06:34:47 there it is! mwahaha
[06:45:26] <BruteShot> My agent's going to be pissed yo
[06:51:42] <keglevich> Since I'm not familiar with jQuery I'd need a little help from someone (jquery guru) with sidebar vertical drop-down menu... I already have html, jquery code, and css... I'd just need a few small modifications...if someone's willing to check it out, I'd be really thankful...
[06:51:42] <jak2000> hi all
[06:51:44] <jak2000> Uhkis?
[06:55:47] <manners13> i know this is nothing to do with the jquery but can anyone help on why this isnt working
[06:55:48] <manners13> hey guys i wonder if you can help im trying to get results from a multi select drop down ive used this code http://pastebin.com/NWCt5qxd but get no resulsts
[07:07:59] <Uhkis> jak2000: ?
[07:47:18] <Jfaunce> Is there a way that I can append to a user input?  Like if I have an <input> in a form, and whenever a user puts something in it, and hits submit it adds a word to the end of what they entered?
[07:47:41] <Jfaunce> Like, they put in cat and it comes up as "cat-dog" or if they say beach it says "beach-dog"
[07:47:44] <Jfaunce> Deos that make sense?
[07:47:44] <tejasmanohar> hey
[07:47:56] <tejasmanohar> when do i use .then() vs .done() ?
[07:48:04] <tejasmanohar> jquery 2.x.x
[07:48:25] <tejasmanohar> and does .done() fire even if there's an error..? where's the standard .then() .catch() gone? i'm doing $.ajax()
[07:49:51] <tejasmanohar> i want one fn on the promise for resolved failure and one for resolved success, not sure what the best solution that is
[07:54:14] <Uhkis> ?api ajax
[07:54:15] <b-ot> Uhkis: No matches.
[07:54:17] <Uhkis> ?api ajax()
[07:54:20] <b-ot> Uhkis: No matches.
[07:54:25] <Uhkis> grr
[07:54:30] <Uhkis> ?api jQuery.ajax()
[07:54:31] <b-ot> Uhkis: No matches.
[07:55:06] <Uhkis> tejasmanohar: http://api.jquery.com/jquery.ajax/
[08:06:59] <BruteShot> Uhkis: Sounds like b-ot says you're no match for him, you're going to take that?  Like really?
[08:07:10] * BruteShot grabs popcorn and watches patiently
[08:08:06] <Uhkis> js> print("I'm a stupid bot");
[08:08:09] <b-ot> Uhkis: I'm a stupid bot
[08:08:15] <Uhkis> BruteShot: see, he's stupid!
[08:08:48] <BruteShot> lol
[08:09:04] <BruteShot> He's definitely not passing the turing's test :P
[10:19:35] <akaustav> Hi
[10:20:26] <akaustav> I am new to jquery.
[10:21:20] <akaustav> I am trying to understand how to use a jquery plugin.
[10:21:28] <akaustav> Can anyone help?
[10:21:52] <rumpel> akaustav, what's the problem?
[10:22:59] <akaustav> rumpel, thanks for responding. This might sound like a dumb question, but I seem to have problems in loading sequence of a plugin
[10:23:39] <akaustav> It's the Bootstrap Image Gallery
[10:23:40] <akaustav> https://github.com/blueimp/Bootstrap-Image-Gallery
[10:25:33] <jayjo> is it possible to upload an image not as a data url? What are the other options even?
[10:27:19] <akaustav> @rumpel: I want to extend the Bootstrap Image Gallery object
[10:28:39] <akaustav> But have been unable to do so since I am not sure if the global object window.Gallery is even present or not
[10:31:05] <akaustav> The loading sequence should be:
[10:31:09] <akaustav> 1. jquery
[10:31:20] <akaustav> 2. JQuery BlueImp Gallery
[10:31:43] <akaustav> 3. Bootstrap Image Gallery
[10:32:02] <rumpel> akaustav, any error in javascript terminal?
[10:32:07] <akaustav> 4. My app.js - where I place my extension code
[10:32:13] <akaustav> Let me check
[10:38:33] <akaustav> It's an error message loaded by the plugin itself.
[10:38:56] <akaustav> Says: blueimp Gallery: No or empty list provided as first argument.
[10:39:21] <akaustav> You can see the error on this page: http://wilder.su/persanna/ameet/html/gallery2.html
[10:46:40] <akaustav> rumpel, maybe I ought to use an un-minified version of the library files.
[10:47:11] <akaustav> rumpel, I'll plug in the un-minified versions. Standby.
[10:48:47] <akaustav> rumpel, done. Now I see javascript errors
[10:49:16] <rumpel> akaustav, good
[10:49:38] <akaustav> Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'Gallery' of undefined
[10:51:01] <dot> one quick question, if you use $('#linkform').submit(function (e) { than you can not do jquery validation right ?
[10:51:10] <dot> it skips validation it just submits the form
[10:51:35] <akaustav> dot, which browser are you using?
[10:51:43] <dot> akaustav chrome
[10:52:02] <akaustav> dot, try returning false if you don't want to submit the form
[10:52:28] <akaustav> dot, it's just a guess, I may have to look at the code to understand what's going wrong
[10:52:38] <akaustav> dot, but do give it a try
[10:52:45] <dot> akaustav i want to submit it, but I have to validate it before submitting
[10:57:19] <NitroLiq> Hi all. Trying to create a focus toggle that when a a text field is in focus, the bottom border of a parent container animates to a different color and back when not in focus (blur).
[10:57:33] <NitroLiq> This is what I have so far: http://codepen.io/anon/pen/waLLPN
[10:58:06] <NitroLiq> But the only thing I can get so far is setting the initial border on the container div
[10:58:48] <NitroLiq> What am I doing wrong?
[11:24:17] <akaustav> So, rumpel
[11:25:26] <akaustav> Now, I am thinking how the closure works
[11:26:17] <akaustav> The function closure on https://github.com/blueimp/Bootstrap-Image-Gallery/blob/master/js/bootstrap-image-gallery.js
[11:42:16] <lindii_> is it possible to do some scrolltop with pure css?
[11:48:16] <DelphiWorld> guys... i'm getting mad step by step
[11:48:29] <DelphiWorld> anyone can play video inline (not full screen) on iPhone?
[12:05:39] <DelphiWorld> is the player broken now?
[12:06:02] <DelphiWorld> crap wrong window
[12:11:28] <DelphiWorld> iOS... kick yourself out of my memory!
[12:11:45] <DelphiWorld> can't play  video inline only in fullscreen on iPhone, any idea guys
[12:17:08] <akaustav> lindii, what do you mean by scrolltop?
[12:41:04] <Kamuela> can express middleware specify usage on just post routes?
[12:42:09] <Kamuela> wrong channel :P but i'm open to answers here :D
[12:44:28] <akaustav> \quit
[13:17:34] <tomatto> is possible to find out if event is binded to element already to avoid binding it again?
[13:36:20] <Glyphik> hello
[13:36:29] <Glyphik> i have a question
[13:42:59] <onr> hello Glyphik
[13:43:05] <onr> please don't hesitate to ask your question
[13:43:11] <Glyphik> alright
[13:43:31] <Glyphik> Can anybody tell me why this bit of code won't convert my json data (gon.category_data) into an array (processed_json):  https://gist.github.com/psyglyphik/33b558c754a3430b83aa
[13:43:57] <Glyphik> i'm trying to get my data formatted so I can use highcharts to create a chart from it
[13:44:30] <Glyphik> all I get is an array full of NaNs as the result
[14:02:02] <keglevich> Since I'm not familiar with jQuery I'd need a little help from someone (jquery guru) with sidebar vertical drop-down menu... I already have html, jquery code, and css... I'd just need a few small modifications...if someone's willing to check it out, I'd be really thankful...
[14:05:47] <larsi> ask your question keglevich
[14:05:57] <larsi> if someone wants to help you they will
[14:06:18] <larsi> waiting for someone to ask you what the problem is, is just annoying
[14:09:04] <onr> keglevich: what is the problem?
[14:10:04] <keglevich> simply, I have a wordpress sidebar with custom menu...it's flat menu with about 3 levels...I got some jquery code which does 50% of that I would like it to do in the end...I would like to make it a simple jquery accordion menu... so I'd like to ask someone who has knowledge to look at that menu and try to solve it
[14:11:29] <keglevich> I can provide the link to page via PM if someone's willing to look into it
[14:15:27] <oftl> doesn't work that way; compiling a *minimal* example of your problem and no-pasting it (pastebin.com or something) usually works best
[14:17:05] <keglevich> ok, here I pasted the jQuery code: http://pastebin.com/v2y04zde
[14:17:29] <keglevich> the testpage URL is: http://dev.deliciosa-fotografia.es/main/
[14:18:20] <keglevich> check that "stranski meni" ...this is the menu I would like to look like a simple accordion menu, but with the current code it is always closed and those "parents" are not links as they should be...
[14:19:25] <keglevich> I'd like all the menu links to be clickable, and maybe a simple toggle signs at the right side (+,-) to toggle the menu... when the current page is active, it should be colored in menu...
[14:34:46] <keglevich> of there's something else I should provide, I'd be glad to help..
[14:34:57] <keglevich> of=if
[15:17:01] <bnovc> hello - I'm using $.ajax and setting a timeout to 100000, but I am still getting "Failed to load resource: The request timed out" in Safari.  I can clearly see the page being sent back from NodeJS to the browser, but it ignores it after
[15:17:09] <bnovc> is this a Safari limit that I cant change also or something?
[15:17:22] <bnovc> the request took 10s
[15:25:52] <geri> hi, what does line 41 to 44? http://ideone.com/GlPXSH
[15:27:02] <larsi> it makes a request to http://localhost:9999/gettime geri
[15:27:15] <larsi> then it empties #output and appends the returned data
[15:28:18] <geri> larsi: could you also send a xmhttp request instead?
[15:28:25] <geri> xml
[15:29:11] <larsi> jquery uses xmlhttprequest
[15:29:20] <geri> oh
[15:29:30] <larsi> using their framework just makes it easier to create requests
[15:29:36] <geri> idk if it makes sense to use jquery bc of that
[15:30:12] <larsi> $.get('url', function(response) { console.log(response); });
[15:30:18] <larsi> as opposed to declaring a bunch of variables
[15:30:32] <geri> i need to send the slider value to the webserver
[15:30:45] <geri> to rescale the images
[15:31:05] <tash> anyone around that has used dataTables before?
[15:31:33] <larsi> What do you mean geri?
[15:33:02] <geri> larsi: http://picpaste.com/pics/Screen_Shot_2015-08-22_at_11.41.10_PM-2kw3OPf2.1440282773.png
[15:33:13] <geri> i added a slider: to resize the images
[15:33:52] <geri> so it sends the value of the slider within a xmlhttprequest to the webserver ... to resize the images
[15:34:39] <geri> like that: http://ideone.com/RvKe7C
[15:34:54] <bnovc> it would seem that 'timeout' is just broken in $.ajax.  It works fine when I tested with xmlhttp by itself
[15:34:58] <bnovc> sad
[15:35:00] <geri> but im not sure how to add the current value of the slider to the xmlhttprequest
[15:52:14] <larsi> that depends on how the value is stored geri
[15:52:31] <geri> i got it work :D
[16:01:54] <geri> larsi: i have that defined in jquery:  $('#result').html(data);
[16:02:05] <geri> how can i do that with javascript?
[16:04:04] <larsi> document.getElementById("result").innerHTML = "";
[16:05:39] <geri> larsi: thx :D
[16:06:40] <geri> larsi: document.getElementById("result").innerHTML = data;   ?
[16:06:51] <larsi> yes
[16:07:37] <geri> larsi: it seems not to work
[16:09:34] <geri> larsi: ah, ok works
[16:09:36] <geri> great
[16:17:09] <PapaSierra> hi, does anyone know mootools' behavior framework? what is the equivalent for jquery?
[16:17:51] <eight8> PapaSierra: jquery ui
[16:20:22] <PapaSierra> eight8: thanks, but jquery ui appears to be a collection of widgets. what about the declarative html glue code that invokes these things?
[16:20:52] <eight8> PapaSierra: i have no fucking clue
[16:21:02] <PapaSierra> ok sure
[16:21:17] <eight8> PapaSierra: thanks, let me know if you need anything else
[16:25:36] <geri> i use a: <input type="file" name="TheFile" ... how can i change the text "Choose File" ?
[16:30:50] <larsi> not possibly geri
[16:30:55] <larsi> possible
[16:31:01] <geri> noo :(
[16:31:06] <geri> why
[16:31:36] <larsi> it's up to the browser the person is using
[16:31:43] <larsi> but it's mostly due to security reasons
[16:33:32] <geri> larsi: whats the alternative?
[16:34:25] <larsi> http://markusslima.github.io/bootstrap-filestyle/
[16:38:20] <geri> larsi: what about that? http://jsfiddle.net/J8ekg/
[16:40:01] <larsi> it's a hacky way geri
[16:41:49] <larsi> it has the file element that has display set to none
[16:41:56] <larsi> then it just utilizes that
[16:42:23] <larsi> modifying the value of the file element itself is not possible
[16:42:53] <skypce> hello
[16:43:19] <skypce>  $(this).hasClass("clicked") ? ($(this).removeClass("clicked")
[16:43:24] <skypce> what means the ? ?
[16:43:36] <larsi> it's the ternary operator
[16:43:52] <larsi> basically if (this) { do that } else { do that }
[16:44:12] <larsi> 1 === 1 ? yes: no;
[16:44:33] <skypce> great
[16:44:39] <skypce> thank you larsi
[16:44:53] <larsi> yw

[17:36:33] <teegee> Hi
[17:36:55] <teegee> is this a good place to ask about jqplot?
[17:37:22] <Nasp> Not if you ask like that
[17:37:43] <teegee> oh :/
[17:38:33] <teegee> Well, I guess it's not particularly jqplot anyway
[17:40:07] <teegee> Could you tell me how to ask correctly?
[17:46:23] <teegee> Nasp?
[17:47:13] <Nasp> I hope thats a joke
[17:49:48] <teegee> So, in my site I've got a jqplot, which reloads data every second from an external source. I do that via replot() because the amount of plots may change
[17:51:06] <teegee> instead of assembling the parameter I'm sending to replot on the page I'd like to assemble it where the data is generated because I have all the information available there and then send it as a JSON object
[17:54:31] <teegee> How would I convert that JSON object into the parameter that replot() takes?
[17:59:25] <teegee> JSON data might look like that: http://pastebin.com/tDzuSfL6
[18:02:00] <teegee> let's say the variable containing that data is called "result". I've tried the obvious: plot.replot(result.UID3649);
[23:59:59] <keglevich> hello all... I'm working on a wordpress page and since I'm not familiar with jQuery I'd need a little help from someone (jquery guru) with sidebar vertical drop-down menu... I already have html, jquery code, and css... I'd just need a few small modifications...if someone's willing to check it out, I'd be really thankful...
