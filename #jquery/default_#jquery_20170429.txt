[01:38:18] <PersianMG> I am trying to run a php page which required jquery 1.3 and sizzle.js. I got the right versions loaded but I keep getting an error: chatlogex.php:29 Uncaught ReferenceError: die is not defined
[01:38:18] <PersianMG>     at Object.cback [as success], any ideas?
[02:03:21] <PersianMG> Ah fixed, somehow the php script starting with a blank empty line messed it up
[06:24:06] <hhhh1612> hi I have spent about 6 months with jquery and now want to contribute as I am an open source enthusiastic.Please help me getting started
[06:31:19] <Ice_Strike> Does anyone know any good website that I can enter the url and it will try to detect all the jquery plugins that website is using?
[08:15:40] <chrisml> is it possible to have one ui-datepicker pick two dates?
[10:55:53] <Sandlayth> hello guys
[10:56:06] <Sandlayth> i've began to code a website using ajax
[10:56:15] <Sandlayth> but i'm getting lost now
[10:56:44] <Sandlayth> i mean, here is what i do: https://github.com/Sandlayth/PizzAjax
[10:57:13] <Sandlayth> I firstly though a website using entirely ajax for db communication could be cool
[10:57:46] <Sandlayth> but now, i realize that it's hard to manage
[10:57:55] <Sandlayth> i'm getting spaghetti code
[10:58:32] <Sandlayth> Could you please advise me? Have a to use a specifiq framework? Using only ajax is a bad idea?
[17:24:01] <tables_> https://paste2.org/B7mAO9N3 <-- when i click celsius, i want to show all divs that are id 'celsiusdiv'  instead of just the first div it finds
[17:24:17] <tables_> can someone help me fix that?
[17:25:08] <snover> it is illegal to have more than one element with the same ID.
[17:25:35] <snover> if you need to reference multiple elements, you should be using a class name instead.
[17:26:20] <tables> ok how do i do it with class?
[17:26:29] <tables> how about id's containing the word celsius
[17:26:38] <tables> celsiusa
[17:26:40] <tables> celsiusb
[17:26:41] <tables> and so on
[19:01:03] <TikityTik> why does this give undefined? console.log($('#trocaderoSearchField').value); trocaderoSearchField is the field for a text field in a form.
[19:02:33] <TikityTik> nevermind, had to use val()
[19:05:45] <harej> https://jsbin.com/yukodahijo/edit?html,js,output << when this function runs, it does not actually change the value of the data parameter in the DOM. am I doing something in particular wrong?
[19:11:42] <shoky_> harej: it's not supposed to. it updates jquery's internal data cache.  updating the actual DOM is expensive and not needed
[19:12:13] <harej> shoky_: so the change applies, even if the DOM says otherwise. correct?
[19:12:14] <shoky_> harej: you're still able to read the new data, if you use .data()
[19:12:30] <harej> This is actually consistent with what I've been finding in my browser's console. Thank you!
[19:12:32] <shoky_> harej: the change to the data applies, yes. it has nothing to do with attributes on the DOM element
[19:13:10] <shoky_> harej: the only connection to data-xxx attributes, is that the first time you use .data() to READ an element's data - it will fetch the data-xxx attributes and use those as the initial data
[19:13:24] <shoky_> it'll never read the attributes again, or write to them
[19:13:24] <harej> Makes sense.
[19:13:35] <TikityTik> Is there a way to enable CORS just for a webpage? I'm trying to make a webpage someone create a sales listing on a bunch of websites with just one webpage
[19:13:52] <TikityTik> for someone*
[19:14:00] <shoky_> TikityTik: you have the server respond with CORS headers for just that url
[19:14:18] <shoky_> nothing to do with the client-side, or jquery :p
[19:14:29] <TikityTik> shoky_, so I can't do anything if the server doesn't allow it?
[19:15:41] <shoky_> TikityTik: you can't fetch the data directly from the browser, but you can proxy it through your own server, and fetch the data in your server
[19:16:15] <TikityTik> shoky_, why can't I just create an html page to do that?
[19:16:23] <shoky_> TikityTik: to do what?
[19:16:38] <TikityTik> shoky_, to fetch the data from another domain
[19:17:00] <shoky_> TikityTik: the browser won't allow it if the server doesn't respond with CORS headers
[19:17:30] <TikityTik> shoky_, so the webpage has to literally be hosted somewhere in order to fetch data from another website?
[19:17:59] <shoky_> uh no idea what you mean
[19:18:52] <shoky_> either the target server has to allow it,  or you have your own server fetch the data for the browser
[19:19:52] <TikityTik> shoky_, I want to fetch data from a website that's not owned by me and search through the user's inventory with the given string
[19:20:15] <shoky_> TikityTik: ok see what i just said ;p
[19:20:33] <TikityTik> shoky_, so does that mean if I host this webpage somewhere, it will be allowed to fetch data from the other website?
[19:20:43] <TikityTik> from the other website which didn't allow CORS
[19:21:01] <shoky_> TikityTik: the server will be allowed to, yes.. only browsers care about CORS stuff
[19:21:17] <TikityTik> shoky_, couldn't the server...intercept that information?
[19:21:20] <shoky_> but you have to write the server code that fetches from the other server..
[19:21:27] <shoky_> what?
[19:21:36] <shoky_> what server.. intercept what information..?
[19:21:42] <TikityTik> shoky_, the returned information from $.get
[19:21:56] <shoky_> huh..?
[19:22:33] <TikityTik> shoky_, when you say write the server code, you mean just writing the webpage?
[19:22:44] <TikityTik> and just host it on httpd or whatever
[19:23:08] <shoky_> TikityTik: no, write backend code in whatever language your backend is using (e.g. node.js or php or whatever..)
[19:23:33] <shoky_> TikityTik: if you don't have a backend, and are just serving static html pages, then you can't do it
[19:23:55] <TikityTik> I see
[19:33:49] <daveisdave_> Hello?
[19:34:04] <daveisdave_> Anyone there?
[19:36:29] <daveisdave_> Anyone?
[19:47:58] <daveisdave> Hello
[19:48:21] <daveisdave> I've got a question about jquery
[19:51:03] <daveisdave> Anyone there?
[23:48:07] <Alturic> Hey guys, if I wanted to append(), and then append() to THAT, and then append() to that, what would be the best approach? I tend to make a single append() and put everything in a single line, but it's becoming unreadable.
