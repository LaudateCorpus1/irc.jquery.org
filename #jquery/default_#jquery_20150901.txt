[00:17:33] <Squarism> Hey. "TAB" key on input="text" can trigger "onchange" if ive changed the value of the field. Is it possible to append extra attributes to these onchange events?
[00:17:50] <Cork> Squarism: extra attributes?
[00:17:54] <Cork> to the callback call?
[00:18:16] <Squarism> Cork: To the onchange event triggered by the TAB keypress
[00:18:34] <Cork> tab triggers onchange cause you change focus in the page
[00:18:37] <Cork> cause cause of the tab
[00:19:37] <Squarism> Cork: Well can i control how the onchange event is triggered (and append extra info)?
[00:19:49] <Cork> no
[00:19:59] <Cork> Squarism: what are you trying to do?
[00:22:48] <Squarism> Within a tag divA ive nested one form field inputB (input="text"). divA has a onchange listener/handler that triggers a ajax request. I want to have extra code executed  by the divA listener if the onchange event triggered by TABing from inputB.
[00:22:55] <Squarism> -->Cork
[00:23:34] <Kartagis> Cork: any ideas for me?
[00:23:37] <Cork> tabbing from inputb contra onchange from what?
[00:23:42] <Cork> Kartagis: like i said no
[00:23:58] <Cork> you have to figure out why the server gives you different responses from what you expect
[00:24:00] <Kartagis> sorry, didn't see that
[00:24:10] <Cork> it isn't a jquery question, but an api question
[00:25:32] <Squarism> tabbing from inputB as opposed to change focus with say mouse
[00:25:57] <Squarism> -> Cork
[00:26:01] <Cork> there isn't really a way to do that
[00:26:20] <Cork> you could bind keydown on the input field and check for the tab key there
[00:26:34] <Cork> but that's about it (and it tends to be buggy if you do)
[00:34:25] <Uhkis> what on earth could cause $(element).height() being different on first load vs. cached version
[00:34:38] <Cork> timing
[00:34:44] <Cork> meaning missing .ready
[00:35:02] <toomus> Hi all
[00:35:53] <toomus> How to detect arrow up and down key press in input field?
[00:36:05] <Cork> keydown and check event.keyCode
[00:38:36] <toomus> Cork: Ah, OK, THX :)
[00:39:40] <Uhkis> Cork: of course.. thought that the drupal js stuff was already dom ready wrapped
[02:48:03] <toomus> I have some problem with emoji integration
[02:48:25] <toomus> I want to make suggestions box like Github when user is typing
[02:49:14] <toomus> Is very tricky :)
[02:54:51] <toomus> Where can i put my screenshot to show you what I mean?
[02:58:23] <toomus> What I already have http://oi62.tinypic.com/117720y.jpg
[03:00:51] <arc_> use imgur not tinypic. this site doesn't even work for me
[03:02:28] <toomus> arc_: http://i.imgur.com/jy2iMLJ.png
[03:03:04] <arc_> so what's the problem
[03:03:17] <toomus> I know how to handle situation when user is in the end of input field
[03:03:43] <toomus> But I don't know how to handle something like this http://i.imgur.com/jy2iMLJ.png
[03:04:01] <arc_> that's the same image
[03:04:06] <toomus> wait, I mean this http://i.imgur.com/jy2iMLJ.png
[03:04:12] <arc_> one more try :p
[03:04:56] <toomus> I ulpoaded 2 images at once, and they have the same url
[03:05:17] <toomus> maybe this http://imgur.com/jy2iMLJ,pY7HDmR#1
[03:05:30] <arc_> http://i.imgur.com/pY7HDmR.png <- that's the link you wanted
[03:06:02] <arc_> yeah sorry i have no idea how this would work
[03:06:27] <toomus> Try to comment something in Github :)
[03:06:52] <arc_> no, i understand what your problem is but i don't know how to fix it
[03:07:23] <toomus> yeah, it's very tricky to me too :)
[03:08:04] <arc_> i guess you would have to tokenize the full string and reset the autocomplete each time length of the current token is 0
[03:08:16] <arc_> i could do that in mirc script but not javascript :p
[03:16:22] <Squarism> How can i write a jquery selector for "NOT display=none"
[03:16:42] <Uhkis> :visible
[03:17:39] <Squarism> like $('#someId').next(':visible')
[03:17:44] <Squarism> should workk?=
[03:18:29] <Squarism> Uhkis, ?
[03:23:30] <Uhkis> ?tias
[03:23:30] <b-ot> Uhkis: Try It And See
[03:46:44] <Squarism> in a set of elements.. how do i find all matching among the elements AND its descendants? Ie...i cannot do myElemes.find("..") as it only searches descendants.
[03:47:16] <Squarism> ah closest?
[03:47:52] <arc_> i think closest only returns one match?
[03:48:26] <arc_> yes
[03:49:20] <Cork> Squarism: no closest looks at parents
[03:49:31] <Cork> Squarism: there isn't anything to look at the set and all there children
[03:49:48] <Cork> so you would have to do two selections for that
[03:50:57] <arc_> would it be possible to get multiple selections as one jquery object somehow
[03:51:06] <arc_> just curious
[03:52:45] <Squarism> Cork, so there is no function available for this ? How would you do it?
[03:52:53] <Squarism> ...in short terms
[04:00:14] <Squarism> doesnt $(selector, elems) do just that.. search elems and their descendants?
[04:01:48] <Squarism> can you combine jquery selector ":vibisble" with a css class selectors and in rule1 AND rule2
[04:01:51] <Squarism> ?
[04:03:21] <Duvdevan> jQuery has 99 names in the Qoran
[04:03:56] <Cork> Squarism: no $(selector, elms) === $(elms).find(selector)
[04:04:40] <Cork> Squarism: about :visible, please show the selector you're working with
[04:05:12] <Squarism> i wanna find tags with css class "fld-con" that are visible
[04:05:45] <Cork> visible as in not display: none, or visible as in displayed to the user in the current scroll position?=
[04:06:06] <Squarism> visible as in not display: none
[04:06:11] <Cork> $('.fld-con:visible')
[04:06:21] <Squarism> hmm
[04:08:38] <Squarism> Cork, that doesnt seem to work
[04:08:50] <Cork> well it does exactly what you asked for
[04:09:02] <Cork> i recommend creating a jsfiddle with a demo of your problem
[04:22:35] <Squarism> Gah.. i have a hard time accepting jquery doesnt have a "search all trees" function
[04:22:54] <Squarism> doesnt make sense =D
[04:23:08] <Cork> Squarism: it might well have support for what you want to do
[04:23:16] <Cork> just present an example of the problem
[04:23:36] <Squarism> Cork, https://jsfiddle.net/rqtmzegq/
[04:23:41] <Squarism> can u see that somehow?
[04:25:31] <Cork> from what i can tell you never need to find it on siblings?
[04:26:31] <Squarism> Cork, trust me i do
[04:26:37] <Squarism> fld-con
[04:26:55] <Cork> well then you're example is flawed
[04:27:11] <Cork> (also i asked for an example not a full webpage)
[04:31:20] <Squarism> ok.. gonna do that
[04:50:11] <khurram> is there any amazon web services channel ?
[04:51:42] <Woet> did you try ##aws?
[05:02:04] <instance> hey I'm using jquery mobile, and was wondering how do i make a text input with an icon button inlined beside it
[05:12:09] <taplar> not too familiar with the mobile, but you can create an inline icon with a css stylized <i> element and to make it a button i'd assume you could attach whatever event handlers to it you needed.
[05:14:12] <Squarism> Cork, ok.. wierd.. in this fiddle your selector combine works well https://jsfiddle.net/rqtmzegq/4/
[05:15:52] <instance> taplar hmm, got an example?
[05:16:32] <taplar> let me see what i can throw together
[05:17:04] <taplar> actually i can do you one better
[05:17:17] <taplar> go to fontawesome.io and right click on one of their icons on their main page
[05:17:49] <taplar> imho, font awesome is a great icon library
[05:18:34] <instance> hmm
[05:18:38] <instance> i wonder if this will work on mobile
[05:19:19] <taplar> it should.  there may even be smaller versions so the load is not as large as it could be on desktop, but i'm not sure about that
[05:20:38] <km4> hi, arr = [v1,v2,v3,v1,v1,v2], how can i sort this arr and have count with objects? example > arr[v1:3, v2:2, v3:1]
[05:20:44] <Cork> Squarism: so the problem is either that the tree doesn't match your live code, or that you run the selector when the tree is in a different state
[05:21:11] <Cork> km4: so you want to sort and then reduce them?
[05:21:36] <km4> yes
[05:21:50] <Cork> arr.sort().each()
[05:21:54] <Cork> opps
[05:21:57] <km4> I got big array with the same objects value
[05:22:06] <Cork> meant $.each(arr.sort(), function(i, val) {}
[05:22:23] <Cork> then you would have to build a new array with the objects in the each loop
[05:22:41] <Cork> though that said i would prob create an object instead
[05:23:33] <Cork> meant var obj = {}; $.each(arr.sort(), function(i, val) { obj[val] = obj[val] || 0; obj[val]++; });
[05:24:11] <Cork> that would give you { "v1":3, "v2":2, "v3":1 }
[05:26:29] <km4> testing to fillde ;)
[05:26:32] <km4> on*
[05:30:08] <km4> Cork: thanks for code :) its working fine
[06:24:52] <Kartagis> Cork: would you be interested to know what I found about that Unexpected token < issue?
[06:52:08] <Xatenev> heya, need some quick help :P
[06:52:23] <Xatenev> im trying to use .on("click","a", function(event) { ... } for event delegation
[06:52:38] <Xatenev> so for elements which are later applied to the DOM, this onclick counts too
[06:52:44] <Xatenev> it just doesnt work xd
[06:52:59] <taplar> yup, so long as the parent already exists, and the children are being added to it
[06:53:08] <Xatenev> thats my full code http://jsfiddle.net/30qaa7gp/
[06:53:37] <Xatenev> it works the very first time
[06:53:40] <Cork> Xatenev: as long as that li is static it should work
[06:53:44] <Xatenev> ah
[06:53:50] <Xatenev> well I guess the full DOM is replaced then
[06:53:56] <Xatenev> so i have to go some omre parents to the top
[06:54:00] <Xatenev> until i find something static
[06:54:02] <Cork> ya
[06:55:12] <taplar> what's with the return true?
[06:55:40] <Xatenev> just copied it over from some example
[06:55:41] <Cork> i guess a desperate try to get it to work or something
[06:55:56] <Xatenev> xD
[06:55:57] <Cork> (you should never  use return <value>; in an event handler
[06:55:58] <Xatenev> return true for more happiness
[06:56:06] <taplar> lol
[06:56:25] <Xatenev> lol wel
[06:56:29] <Xatenev> obv i cant use event delegation here
[06:56:39] <Xatenev> like.. all the DOM is replaced
[06:56:40] <Xatenev> xD
[06:57:10] <Xatenev> but I cant change that
[06:57:25] <taplar> not recommended, but you could put it on body
[06:57:33] <Xatenev> and then?
[06:57:37] <Xatenev> on("click", "a" scroll top? :P
[06:57:42] <Xatenev> i dont wanna scroll up on every link
[06:57:44] <Xatenev> xd
[06:57:58] <taplar> your matcher would have to be more specific
[06:58:06] <Xatenev> ah wait
[06:58:10] <Xatenev> u r saying i can use
[06:58:19] <Xatenev> jquery("body").on("click", "some > specific > selector" ?
[06:58:23] <taplar> sure
[06:59:10] <Xatenev> taplar: works perfect
[06:59:11] <Xatenev> lolz
[06:59:15] <Xatenev> so easy
[07:00:12] <Xatenev> http://jsfiddle.net/30qaa7gp/1/ thankd
[07:00:14] <Xatenev> s
[07:00:28] <taplar> :)
[07:29:14] <km4> var z = [a,b,c,d,a,b,c];
[07:29:15] <km4> console.log(z);
[07:29:30] <km4> what is wrong ? I have a is not defined
[07:29:38] <taplar> ['a', 'b'...]
[07:30:09] <taplar> they are literals so you have to surround them with single or double quotes
[07:30:18] <taplar> otherwise it will think they are variables
[07:31:03] <km4> ok thanks
[07:31:40] <km4> i must read Eloquent JavaScript ;p
[07:32:44] <taplar> i'm more of an o'reilly guy myself
[07:40:59] <therocode> Hello!
[07:41:16] <taplar> aloha
[07:41:24] <therocode> I need a selector in SOME_SELECTOR here: http://dpaste.com/1KEZ2RQ which selects all .inner that are grandchildren of the same .outer that the calling element has as a parent. Is that possible?
[07:42:06] <taplar> $(this).closest('.outer').find('.inner')
[07:42:51] <taplar> where 'this' is some child of outer
[07:43:53] <TECFALL> How would I go about setting the default date to the selected date once a date has been selected. http://jsfiddle.net/xno5hb34/15/
[07:46:46] <therocode> taplar: Hmm, can I input that inside the element attribute like that? I am getting "Syntax error, unrecognized expression: $(this).closest('.outer').find('.inner')" from jquery when I try
[07:47:06] <therocode> I have managed to input a selector like so: data-jqyoui-options="{accept:'task:not([ng-model=user_story.doingTasks])'}"
[07:47:14] <taplar> no, that would be inside an event handler off of a child element
[07:47:29] <therocode> Is there a way to do it inline in the attribute?
[07:48:27] <taplar> therocode: maybe, with some use of nth-child possibly
[07:49:13] <therocode> Ah. If it's tricky/hacky I'll just investigate using a callback function instead
[07:49:21] <therocode> Thanks for the tip!
[07:53:22] <KjeRw> hello all i was wondering is anyone familiar with dropzone.js I have a form (under laravel 5) that i want the files to upload and append the filenames (autoProcessQueue: false so they all submit at once) to a hidden field on form THEN submit the form. The submit button triggers the processqueue and submission of form.
[08:11:52] <JamesAuth> using dropzone.js and when i do this: http://laravel.io/bin/Xybay i get this error: 'Maximum call stack size exceeded' i just want to fire DropZone then submit form. I am appending filenames to form
[08:12:38] <JamesAuth> if I put e.submit() i get a no function error
[08:14:49] <Cork> sounds like fireing dropzone fires the submit event again
[08:14:53] <Cork> so you create an infinite loop
[08:16:41] <JamesAuth> this is what i am doing with the data returned in dropzone... http://laravel.io/bin/Nk9BV i dont know how it is firing twice
[08:18:20] <JamesAuth> if i get rid of prevent default and submit it goes through but the appended data is not part of Post
[08:20:39] <Cork> you can't add files through javascript to a normal http post
[08:21:08] <JamesAuth> not adding files just the filenames
[08:21:56] <Cork> what happens is most likely that the js gets killed cause the page is unloading
[08:23:08] <JamesAuth> thats why i wanted to prevent the submit add the data received from Dropzone to the form then submit all data. is this impossible??
[08:23:54] <Cork> JamesAuth: you need to figure out why firing dropzone triggers submit again
[08:28:57] <JamesAuth> this same code would work if i just had a random button on the page. All the code is doing is sending the files to my php code. I am saving the files and returning the filenames to be saved to a hidden field. It never submitted the form before. Could it be because i am using the same button to submit the form as i am to trigger ProcessQueue?? this
[08:28:58] <JamesAuth> is what my form looks like http://laravel.io/bin/E3mDm
[08:29:50] <JamesAuth> ProcessQueue  is being triggered from the submit even on the form#create-form
[08:38:00] <JamesAuth> can anyone help me out. trying to processQueue for dropzone on form submit http://laravel.io/bin/E3mDm
[08:53:28] <robertmaxrees> well that was some big news this morning.
[08:54:10] <taplar_> mm?
[08:54:31] <robertmaxrees> http://blog.jquery.com/2015/09/01/jquery-foundation-and-dojo-foundation-to-merge/
[08:56:40] <taplar> cool
[08:58:32] <dimi1947> I know jquery UI has a modal component...but can the same effect be achieved as this one:https://taxibeat.com/   click the contact link on the left
[08:59:20] <robertmaxrees> what part of it?
[08:59:36] <beefman> i'm trying to pass arbitrary information to a change event, but when i write myfunc(parm){..} and then set $(..).change(parms, myfunc), i don't get the value of parms inside myfunc.  what am i missing?
[09:00:17] <dimi1947> robertnextrees are you talking to me?
[09:00:33] <robertmaxrees> dimi1947 yep.
[09:01:10] <dimi1947> well...the whole...thing...the sliding,the darkened background....
[09:02:08] <dimi1947> unless you can suggest something else...besides jquery UI...
[09:05:10] <beefman> http://jsfiddle.net/ddawhsb4/    why doesn't the 2nd console.log show me parms?
[09:06:02] <taplar> beefman: why don't you just call the function?
[09:06:58] <beefman> taplar: i want it to execute on change?
[09:07:13] <JamesAuth> can anyone help me out. trying to processQueue for dropzone on form submit http://laravel.io/bin/E3mDm
[09:07:49] <beefman> taplar: maybe i'm misunderstanding you.
[09:08:12] <robertmaxrees> back
[09:08:25] <taplar> beefman: instead of passing extra stuff in on an event handler, you can attach it to the element as a prop or data element and then it will be available inside the handler
[09:08:34] <robertmaxrees> beefman that extra data is passed as apart of the event object.
[09:10:29] <robertmaxrees> beefman http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/tx5c3hd7/
[09:10:31] <beefman> taplar: i tried that, i think, with $('#foo').mydataval = 'blah', but recreating the jquery object inside the handler evidently destroyed mydataval.
[09:10:48] <robertmaxrees> and that's not how you set props on nodes with jquery
[09:10:59] <taplar> $(selector).prop('key', 'value')
[09:11:00] <robertmaxrees> you'd use .data() in your case.
[09:11:04] <beefman> i see
[09:11:05] <taplar> or data
[09:11:05] <beefman> ty
[09:11:22] <robertmaxrees> but check out that fiddle.
[09:11:26] <beefman> yep looking now
[09:11:33] <robertmaxrees> you access the extra data through the event object if you're passing it via the handler.
[09:12:40] <Dr-007> i'm using something like this to hide a button in my iframe: $('input[type="submit"]', iframe.contents()).hide();
[09:12:54] <Dr-007> not something.. im using that
[09:13:21] <robertmaxrees> is the iframe src on the same domain?
[09:13:26] <Dr-007> anyway, it hides the button. can i test with that piece of code also if the button is available?
[09:13:56] <Dr-007> like; hidden = $('input[type="submit"]', iframe.contents()).hide();    .... if(hidden) ..
[09:14:04] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[09:14:08] <robertmaxrees> are you trying to see if it's hidden?
[09:14:21] <Dr-007> i want to hide it if there is a button
[09:14:28] <Dr-007> (which happends now)
[09:14:28] <robertmaxrees> just try to hide it.
[09:14:42] <Dr-007> but also i want to known if there was a button in the first place
[09:14:45] <robertmaxrees> iframe.contents().find('input[type="submit"]').length
[09:14:48] <Dr-007> so i can execute another function afterwards
[09:14:58] <Dr-007> ah, thanks
[09:15:08] <Dr-007> i should've known that one
[09:16:44] <BaNzounet> Hey, I've a <select> element, that I want to submit, when I've multiple <options> I do this with .on('change'), but when I only have one <option> for what event should I be listening to submit it, when the user open the select et select the currently selected element?
[09:17:19] <robertmaxrees> change
[09:17:22] <robertmaxrees> same event
[09:17:33] <BaNzounet> change won't work since nothing is changing
[09:18:05] <BaNzounet> or at least it's not working in my case
[09:18:07] <robertmaxrees> why are you trying to react to nothing happening?
[09:18:52] <dimi1947> robertmaxtress...did you consider what I told you?
[09:19:00] <BaNzounet> I don't see it like nothing is happening :/
[09:19:12] <robertmaxrees> dimi1947 i must have missed it.  what's up?
[09:19:32] <BaNzounet> The user open the <select> click on the only one element who appears to be already selected
[09:19:43] <robertmaxrees> BaNzounet right - i misread your statement originally.  why are you trying to react to that?
[09:19:56] <robertmaxrees> like, nothing is changing, so what is there to do in that case?
[09:20:14] <dimi1947> a modal like here https://taxibeat.com/ when clicking the contact link on the left...I want to achieve the same effect
[09:20:34] <robertmaxrees> dimi1947 right - you were asking if you could do that with jquery ui.
[09:20:44] <robertmaxrees> you can, but it'd require some hacky stuff around it.
[09:20:54] <dimi1947> yes...that was my q
[09:21:14] <dimi1947> hacky...you mean JS/CSS staff
[09:21:16] <dimi1947> ?
[09:21:46] <robertmaxrees> errr, that part is implied by making a modal.
[09:21:52] <robertmaxrees> that's not offered out of the box by jquery ui.
[09:21:59] <robertmaxrees> you can get the faded background pretty easily.
[09:22:16] <robertmaxrees> the animations would be the "tough" part.
[09:22:36] <dimi1947> can you elaborate please?
[09:22:48] <robertmaxrees> not sure what i'm elaborating on.
[09:23:06] <dimi1947> you say the animation will be the tough part....
[09:23:28] <robertmaxrees> right - everything else is easily done.  what do you need to know specifically?
[09:23:30] <dimi1947> doesn't jquery provide such functionality?
[09:23:43] <robertmaxrees> sure, but you'd have to build that in yourself for the modal.
[09:24:07] <dimi1947> I understand...the goal is that is i done smooth...
[09:24:19] <robertmaxrees> great!
[09:24:44] <dimi1947> and you are saying that this is up to me
[09:24:55] <dimi1947> it has nothing to do with jquery...
[09:24:56] <robertmaxrees> wiring it up is, yeah.
[09:25:04] <robertmaxrees> you could use jquery to do it, sure.
[09:25:21] <dimi1947> but it would not be so smooth...as I understand
[09:25:25] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[09:25:30] <robertmaxrees> what do you mean "smooth"?
[09:25:44] <dimi1947> forget it...
[09:26:43] <dimi1947> so I will do the "wiring" as you say..using jquery functions...am I saying it correct?
[09:26:54] <robertmaxrees> basically?
[09:27:21] <dimi1947> is there anything else to it?
[09:27:29] <robertmaxrees> you're being really vague.
[09:28:10] <dimi1947> that's because I have not quite understand...
[09:28:21] <JamesAuth> using dropzone.js and when i do this: http://laravel.io/bin/Xybay i get this error: 'Maximum call stack size exceeded' i just want to fire DropZone then submit form. I am appending filenames to form...if I put e.submit() i get a no function error
[09:29:00] <robertmaxrees> JamesAuth walk through the code :)
[09:29:13] <dimi1947> Ok...in that modal...can validation be applied....from jquery validate?
[09:29:21] <robertmaxrees> dimi1947 sure.
[09:29:49] <robertmaxrees> JamesAuth you're calling submit, running preventDefault(), calling dropzone, then calling submit, preventDefault(), calling dropzone, then calling submit...
[09:29:51] <robertmaxrees> see the issue?
[09:29:56] <dimi1947> ok....I will start doing it...and be more specific when I reach a specific point
[09:31:11] <claytonzaugg> What's a good suggestion for building a photography site for someone?  As for hosting images, who has the best API for accessing the images and / or what about MongoDB?
[09:31:56] <robertmaxrees> claytonzaugg you could check out using amazon's hosting for images.  all sorts of options available for that though.  what sort of other feedback are you looking for?
[09:32:49] <claytonzaugg> Dunno robertmaxrees, I wanted to put together a quick site for my sisters photography and haven't dealt with images yet, on this level.
[09:33:11] <JamesAuth> ok i did this as well http://laravel.io/bin/PXPV1 i stopped default called dropzone, append the response from dropzone to the form and tried to submit there doesn't work. It will save my files but does not submit the form
[09:33:35] <robertmaxrees> right, because you're preventing default.
[09:35:48] <JamesAuth> yes but within the success of the dropzone obj i am submitting because i don't want to submit the form until Response is added to the form inputs
[09:36:08] <robertmaxrees> lol right, and you're preventing default.  calling submit against that form won't ever work because you stop it.
[09:37:15] <robertmaxrees> let me cook up an example.
[09:38:12] <JamesAuth> so how am i suppose to do this. call dropzone first? because even when i remove lines 11-12 and 26-31 it will submit but i will not see my appended data
[09:38:18] <robertmaxrees> one sec.
[09:38:24] <JamesAuth> thnks
[09:42:36] <robertmaxrees> https://bpaste.net/show/351323976b01
[09:42:38] <robertmaxrees> something like this.
[09:45:28] <Audioburn> with jquery-ui's datepicker, how do I block out certain dates on the calendar?
[09:45:44] <Audioburn> oh, mindate maxdate
[09:47:04] <Audioburn> wait no
[09:47:14] <JamesAuth> robermaxrees what is ShouldSubmit suppose to be?
[09:47:15] <Audioburn> how do I block out multiple dates, not just one spectrum?
[09:47:38] <robertmaxrees> JamesAuth it's a boolean.
[09:48:04] <taplar> Audioburn: what are you wanting to restrict?
[09:48:09] <robertmaxrees> JamesAuth walk through it ;)
[09:49:13] <Audioburn> taplar, the dates that a user can book a reservation. If a reservation is already booked for say 3 days straight, I want to let the user know those 3 days aren't available, but every day after and before those days are

[09:51:24] <claytonzaugg> what could cause a mousewheel not to scroll unless you resize the window first?
[09:51:59] <Audioburn> robertmaxrees, thanks so much man
[09:52:56] <taplar> claytonzaugg: loss of focus?
[09:53:28] <claytonzaugg> Okay, but if I click in the area that should scroll, it still doesn't scroll
[09:55:57] <robertmaxrees> claytonzaugg something is applying styles after resize.
[09:56:03] <claytonzaugg> taplar, I see the scroll bar, it's definitly present, can even click and drag the scroll bar up and down, just won't let me use the scroll wheel unless I resize.
[09:56:11] <robertmaxrees> can you show us?
[09:56:24] <claytonzaugg> So whatever is applying styles after resizing, is causing the issue you think robertmaxrees?
[09:56:31] <robertmaxrees> maybe?
[09:56:37] <robertmaxrees> without seeing it it's basically impossible to know.
[09:57:03] <claytonzaugg> I cannot unfortunately, this is the beast I've been working on for a couple weeks.  However, let me see what is happening when it resizes, style wise
[10:03:27] <jfive> hi
[10:03:35] <taplar> hi five
[10:03:43] <taplar> how could i pass that up
[10:05:02] <jfive> haha
[10:05:06] <jfive> good one
[10:05:24] <jfive> anyone know how to fire an event to Google Tag Manager v2 in an ajax call's complete method?
[10:05:37] <jfive> teh googles is turning up nothing
[10:05:39] <robertmaxrees> have any docs or anything?
[10:06:02] <robertmaxrees> like, how would you normally fire an event?
[10:06:44] <jfive> robertmaxrees: well apparently the way i usually do it, with say ga('send', 'event', 'Form', 'Form Submission');... isn't working anymore with GTM v2
[10:07:49] <robertmaxrees> sounds like you really have a google tag manager question then.
[10:08:00] <robertmaxrees> https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6164470?hl=en
[10:08:52] <jfive> robertmaxrees: yes, you may slap me with the off-topic fish, i hang my head in shame
[10:08:59] <robertmaxrees> lol it's not a big deal.
[10:09:33] <jfive> i wish that article had a date, or mentioned if that was about v2 or not
[10:10:02] <robertmaxrees> (shrug) go to the tag manager admit and look around for docs.
[10:10:40] <jfive> now that's some smart thinkin' sir
[10:10:45] * jfive slaps his forehead
[10:10:58] <taplar> now your just torturing me
[10:12:08] <jfive> i'm not actually sure if i personally have access to the gtm admin sadly
[10:13:18] <alturic> hey guys, I'm using two different .change functions to alter an img src. One changes a portion of the src and the other changes a second portion of the src. I'm trying to wrap my head around how exactly I'd have each function change the respective section of the img src filename only?
[10:13:45] <jfive> alturic: maybe with .replace() ?
[10:14:30] <JamesAuth> robertmaxrees it submits but no appended data i tried the following,  http://laravel.io/bin/42Vk9   but nothing. i see it being appended on the form f12 on browser,  but it will either not send with form or just stay on page with no refresh
[10:14:41] <robertmaxrees> alturic huh?  have a fiddle?
[10:15:15] <robertmaxrees> JamesAuth does processQueue need a callback?
[10:15:27] <alturic> So how would that work with function1 being: .replace('src','http://domain.com/img_source_CHANGETHISONLY');   and function2 being: .replace('src','http://domain.com/img_CHANGETHISONLY_keepthisexistionsection'); ? or would it not be that way?
[10:15:46] <robertmaxrees> make a fiddle pls :)
[10:15:59] <JamesAuth> i dont know what tht means. it doesnt take any params if that is what you're asking
[10:16:41] <robertmaxrees> JamesAuth if (myDropzone.processQueue()) { seems really strange to me.
[10:16:51] <robertmaxrees> so i'm trying to understand what you're trying to do with that.
[10:17:28] <robertmaxrees> the if is totally out of place - you're basically calling processqueue twice.
[10:17:45] <JamesAuth> i just want to fire that submit line after processQueue is completed. I figure it is not including the appended data because it is submitting before the function has completed. adding that i figure will force it to wait for a return value before continuing
[10:18:49] <JamesAuth> even if i get rid of line 4 still nothing
[10:18:53] <robertmaxrees> that's not how that works.
[10:18:58] <robertmaxrees> you can't "force it" to do anything.
[10:19:05] <robertmaxrees> the function just runs.
[10:19:23] <robertmaxrees> go check the dropzone docs and look to see what sort of events you can hook into.
[10:21:57] <swahili> hi
[10:22:52] <swahili> Q: Let's say I have <ul><li>...</li>*10</ul>, and I'd like to split it into two different <ul>. What's the fastest way to do it ? Any suggestions ?
[10:23:52] <robertmaxrees> so you have http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/t5f6gtkd/ to start with?
[10:23:59] <robertmaxrees> what are you splitting on?
[10:25:15] <swahili> robertmaxrees: thanks for looking! yeah, let's say I've got that.
[10:25:29] <robertmaxrees> what criteria are you using to split this into two ULs?
[10:25:43] <robertmaxrees> (knowing what your data looks like would be helpful)
[10:26:13] <swahili> robertmaxrees: I want to slip it if the LI el > 5
[10:27:04] <ravigehlot> Why is this syntax wrong: $('select.lifestyle option[value=]').attr('selected',false);
[10:27:09] <robertmaxrees> .prop
[10:27:13] <ravigehlot> lol
[10:27:16] <robertmaxrees> also value= is wrong
[10:27:16] <ravigehlot> hi robertmaxrees!
[10:27:27] <ravigehlot> robertmaxrees: what should be then instead?
[10:27:32] <robertmaxrees> just value
[10:28:18] <ravigehlot> robertmaxrees: thanks bunches!!!
[10:28:45] <robertmaxrees> swahili check out .slice()
[10:28:48] <robertmaxrees> https://api.jquery.com/slice/
[10:32:55] <robertmaxrees> if you want to overenginner it a bit: http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/t5f6gtkd/2/
[10:33:02] <robertmaxrees> swahili
[10:40:53] <Audioburn> how do I modify a datepicker object after it's been instantiated/
[10:40:54] <Audioburn> ?*
[10:41:16] <robertmaxrees> use the setter syntax
[10:41:20] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jqueryui.com/datepicker/#option-buttonText
[10:41:24] <robertmaxrees> $( ".selector" ).datepicker( "option", "buttonText", "Choose" );
[10:42:23] <Audioburn> robertmaxrees, thank you man, did you contribute to jquery ui or something?
[10:42:28] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[10:42:45] <robertmaxrees> i just know jquery pretty well.  jquery ui's docs are pretty good though.
[10:43:35] <Audioburn> right awesome
[10:54:01] <Dr-007> when you set the height of something via jquery like $('.somediv').height('200px'); it should reflect in the style attribute. righT?
[10:54:44] <robertmaxrees> should.
[10:55:48] <swahili> robertmaxrees: thanks for your suggestion, just noticed it! looks cool!
[10:57:38] <Sal> why when i do $('#id').css('content') it returns a double quoted tring like ""string"" ?
[10:58:26] <Sal> tring=string
[10:58:40] <robertmaxrees> have an example?
[10:59:10] <Sal> nop
[10:59:22] <robertmaxrees> make one then :)
[10:59:29] <Sal> this is how i set the content via css: #id { content: 'string'; }
[11:00:37] <Sal> ok
[11:13:08] <Sal> robertmaxrees, https://jsfiddle.net/zw78susn/3/
[11:13:43] <Sal> as you see, it returns "string" instead of string
[11:14:00] <robertmaxrees> interesting.
[11:14:09] <robertmaxrees> why are you trying to inject it into the markup like that?
[11:14:52] <Sal> why? is ther a "correct" way to do it?
[11:15:08] <robertmaxrees> because that doesn't really make any sense?
[11:15:34] <Sal> i'm using this to get in js what #media i'm in
[11:15:39] <Sal> @media
[11:15:54] <Sal> wait, let me put in the actual code i'm using
[11:15:58] <robertmaxrees> uh
[11:16:01] <Sal> i just recreated a small thing there
[11:16:26] <robertmaxrees> what sort of browser support do you need?
[11:16:49] <Sal> wait, i'll put the correct code then we can chat about it
[11:16:53] <robertmaxrees> lol
[11:17:01] <robertmaxrees> because https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/matchMedia
[11:18:02] <robertmaxrees> what you're doing sounds really awkward - you're using css content with css media queries to figure out the current screen size.
[11:18:09] <robertmaxrees> but you're doing that to feed info to javascript.
[11:18:20] <Sal> this is the idea: https://jsfiddle.net/zw78susn/4/
[11:18:37] <robertmaxrees> yeah, don't do that.
[11:18:38] <Sal> yep
[11:18:42] <Sal> why?
[11:18:44] <robertmaxrees> use matchmedia.
[11:18:48] <robertmaxrees> that's what it's for.
[11:19:03] <Sal> didn't even know its existing
[11:19:12] <Sal> what is it, a $ function?
[11:19:18] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/matchMedia
[11:19:46] <Sal> do i have it on all browsers?
[11:19:55] <robertmaxrees> scroll down on that page dude.
[11:20:04] <robertmaxrees> big ol' heading.
[11:21:16] <Sal> ok, thanks man
[11:21:19] <Sal> i'll use that
[11:28:46] <pugtor> If I'm replacing a portion of a string via a variable when a select option is selected, is there a way to set a "default" for the variable on the initial pageload?
[11:30:59] <taplar> don't see why not
[11:32:00] <taplar> where is this variable?
[11:32:43] <pugtor> right inside the function, first line is: forecastplot = jQuery('#fplot :selected').val();
[11:33:02] <pugtor> On second look, it looks like as long as I have a default select it will use that. derp.
[11:35:38] <sgs03> I have a function where I'm creating a select like this -- var select = $('<select id="mySelect" onChange="change(user)"></select>'); where there `user` arg is passed to the function. Given `user` is `mike` then mike gets substituted in the HTML ok, but I get a mike is `undefined` error. How can I get it to treat `mike` as a string?
[11:37:04] <taplar> so user is a variable?
[11:37:11] <sgs03> yes
[11:38:16] <taplar> what do you mean it gets substituted?
[11:38:53] <sgs03> meaning the output HTML is <select id="mySelect" onChange="change(mike)
[11:39:06] <taplar> and mike is not a variable
[11:39:29] <taplar> so if you want it to be a literal string you'll have to surround it with quotes
[11:39:33] <sgs03> user = "mike" is what's passed to the function
[11:39:44] <walid332> havng a problem with hiding menu on click

[11:40:08] <walid332> when i click on the menu it opens like it should and displays on the link
[11:40:18] <walid332> but when clicking on the link, it should hide the menu
[11:40:21] <walid332> :/
[11:40:27] <walid332> could somone help ?
[11:40:30] <taplar> walid332: got a fiddle?
[11:40:50] <walid332> is codepen ok, since fiddle wont work for me
[11:40:52] <walid332> ?
[11:40:58] <taplar> sure
[11:41:03] <walid332> ok give me a sec
[11:41:05] <walid332> thanks
[11:47:31] <sgs03> taplar: not sure I understand. Like this? onChange="change("x")"
[11:48:20] <taplar> single quotes since your outer are double
[11:48:33] <taplar> and escape them since the entire string is surrounded by singles
[11:48:41] <taplar> is there a reason your replacing the variable with it's actual value?
[11:49:47] <sgs03> like this? onChange="change(\'x\')"
[11:49:53] <taplar> yeah
[11:49:59] <sgs03> I'm not trying to replace the variable, just passing it to another function
[11:50:15] <sgs03> that function being `change`
[11:50:20] <taplar> one sec...
[11:52:47] <taplar> http://jsfiddle.net/bvgqzttx/
[11:52:53] <walid332> taplar
[11:53:32] <taplar> yup?
[11:53:36] <walid332> this menu actually opens, idk why it wont work here but the problem is to make it when the link is clicked the menu closes automatically http://codepen.io/anon/pen/epYjJP
[11:58:30] <taplar> i see jquery, css, and some markup.  i don't see where your doing javascript for a menu
[11:58:50] <lindii_> is there any other way to add to my list an active class with "popstate" other than doing this https://jsfiddle.net/zh5q142s/
[11:58:53] <walid332> oh one sec taplar
[11:59:56] <sgs03> taplar: thank you, that works and is much cleaner than what I was trying to do
[12:00:03] <taplar> :)
[12:02:55] <walid332> taplar, my foult i forgot to ad another script, but basically this is what ir looks like http://codepen.io/anon/pen/epYjJP  im added so anchor tags for 2 pages so when you click on it it does not redirect (im using jquery to get the content so the page does not refresh)
[12:06:50] <taplar> i still don't see a menu... ?
[12:06:56] <taplar> i mean other than the top menu
[12:08:43] <walid332> taplar http://codepen.io/anon/pen/zvYLZX try this, you can adjust the sice of the page, it should resize
[12:15:25] <wendo3233> taplar sorry i got dc
[12:15:55] <mad_moses> hi, I am creating a link with this jquery function: var url = 'http://domain.com/file.html?' + $.param(obj); What is the reverse funciton of .param? How can I get the values from my url on the next page?
[12:19:00] <wendo3233> could somone help with this http://codepen.io/anon/pen/zvYLZX i cant get the menu to close when the link is clicked (mobile version )
[12:23:00] <taplar_> weird
[12:23:27] <wendo3233> taplar yeah i know
[12:23:49] <taplar_> alright, so i lost my window, lol.  what did i miss
[12:24:09] <wendo3233> taplar
[12:24:21] <wendo3233> http://codepen.io/anon/pen/zvYLZX
[12:24:29] <wendo3233> let me know if you can see the menu when you resize
[12:24:36] <wendo3233> it should be working now
[12:25:40] <taplar_> yep, i see it before and after resize. and that's a bootstrap navbar, not a bootstrap 'menu'.  think that's what was confusing me some, :)
[12:26:10] <wendo3233> yes
[12:26:20] <taplar_> ok, so what's the issue?
[12:26:56] <wendo3233> basically when you click on the menu it expands but then when you click on the link, the menu should close immediately and it does not
[12:27:18] <wendo3233> just when you click on the menu to close it works
[12:27:23] <wendo3233> but for the link it wont
[12:27:25] <wendo3233> :/
[12:28:19] <taplar_> ok, so i'm assuming there is some scripting that is missing on this page for home and about that does that menu expansion?
[12:29:49] <wendo3233> hmm
[12:29:58] <wendo3233> let me check something
[12:30:10] <wendo3233> i need to look up on bootstrap again
[12:30:22] <wendo3233> because thats all i have in the source page
[12:32:10] <Dr-007> question; when i request this height $('#modal_iframe').contents().find("body").height(); it always is "700px". this is the css height i set for #modal_iframe but is not the actual height of all contents inside my iframe. i've been googling this but i cant find a good answer
[12:32:53] <wendo3233> taplar
[12:32:58] <wendo3233> take a look here
[12:33:00] <wendo3233> http://getbootstrap.com/examples/sticky-footer-navbar/#about
[12:33:06] <wendo3233> they dont have this fixed
[12:33:28] <wendo3233> its actually that way
[12:35:59] <wendo3233> taplar ?
[12:35:59] <taplar_> maybe it's me.  clicking the first three options doesn't do anything for me
[12:36:12] <wendo3233> yeah i know
[12:36:17] <taplar_> let me try chrome
[12:36:24] <wendo3233> do you know how can this be fixed ?
[12:36:34] <wendo3233> so the menu closes after the link is clicked
[12:37:14] <taplar_> you mean like how you click the dropdown and then click contact?
[12:37:36] <taplar_> or a link on the dropdown is clicked
[12:38:14] <wendo3233> link on the dropdown is cliked
[12:38:37] <taplar_> looks like it is doing that on that page
[12:38:40] <wendo3233> i mean sorry
[12:38:49] <wendo3233> when i click the menu
[12:38:56] <wendo3233> its only for the phone version
[12:39:23] <wendo3233> so the menu button is clicked it open the menu like it should
[12:39:36] <wendo3233> but then when the link is clicked it does not close the menu
[12:39:39] <wendo3233> and it should
[12:40:01] <wendo3233> otherwise the menu covers the content of the page
[12:40:19] <taplar_> oh, i dunno about that.  on the phone it would be a touch event, yes?
[12:42:01] <wendo3233> yeah but it should work everywhere i mean you can resize the computer screen and it should work when clicking using the mouse
[12:42:17] <wendo3233> taplar so you not sure how to fix this ?
[12:42:43] <taplar_> right, but you said phone
[12:43:20] <wendo3233> it does not really matter
[12:43:25] <wendo3233> i said phone screen
[12:43:30] <robertmaxrees> what's going on?
[12:43:47] <wendo3233> you can resize the computer so it looks like phone screen
[12:44:05] <wendo3233> i dont care about special smartphone touch event
[12:44:12] <ravigehlot> robertmaxrees: Thanks for the help earlier! I was able to fix all the issues. Stuff works flawlessly now
[12:44:14] <wendo3233> just so it hides the menu basically
[12:44:21] <iamdamannieeez> hello so the jQuery + dojo merge is cool news
[12:45:13] <taplar_> wendo3233: i'm not sure i can answer the question.  i can't say that the events fired from a phone would be the same kind of events as from a pc
[12:45:25] <wendo3233> yes
[12:45:27] <robertmaxrees> http://i.imgur.com/cB0EbyD.jpg

[12:50:25] <wendo3233> robertmaxrees for example this    <li><a href="#">About</a></li>
[12:50:36] <robertmaxrees> i don't see any code related to the menu.
[12:50:42] <robertmaxrees> do you have a functioning example somewhere?
[12:50:48] <wendo3233> yes
[12:50:57] <wendo3233> one sec

[12:51:23] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[12:51:25] <robertmaxrees> your code.
[12:51:29] <robertmaxrees> not an example for bootstrap.
[12:51:49] <wendo3233> this is the page im working on
[12:51:55] <wendo3233> its same thing
[12:52:06] <robertmaxrees> so what thing are you trying to fix?
[12:52:10] <wendo3233> but when you click on the menu button
[12:52:13] <wendo3233> after resizing
[12:52:20] <wendo3233> it wont hide the links
[12:52:34] <wendo3233> it wont hide the menu
[12:52:34] <wendo3233> !
[12:52:35] <robertmaxrees> huh?

[12:52:58] <robertmaxrees> http://i.imgur.com/wWg9Al4.png ?
[12:53:20] <wendo3233> you need to resize the window
[12:53:25] <wendo3233> so its smaller
[12:53:31] <wendo3233> do you have firefox ?
[12:53:38] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[12:53:40] <robertmaxrees> resized down.
[12:53:42] <wendo3233> click on inspect the elemet
[12:53:43] <robertmaxrees> i see the hamburger icon.
[12:53:46] <robertmaxrees> what do i do next?
[12:53:49] <wendo3233> yes
[12:53:55] <wendo3233> now click on it

[12:54:25] <wendo3233> yes
[12:54:28] <taplar_> lol
[12:54:28] <robertmaxrees> you want the menu to close when you click a navigation item?
[12:54:34] <wendo3233> yes
[12:54:39] <taplar_> see i didn't know you wanted me to make the window small, :P
[12:54:41] <robertmaxrees> will those links go to other pages?
[12:54:55] <wendo3233> yes
[12:54:58] <wendo3233> im usisng ajax
[12:54:59] <robertmaxrees> then don't worry about it.
[12:55:08] <robertmaxrees> oh, then they WON'T go to other pages.
[12:55:15] <wendo3233> so there is no refresh basically so the menu has to dissaper

[13:04:04] <wendo3233> robertmaxrees nothng works :/
[13:04:11] <wendo3233> can you help ?
[13:04:13] <robertmaxrees> share your code.
[13:04:18] <robertmaxrees> show us what you're trying.
[13:05:59] <wendo3233> http://codepen.io/anon/pen/zvYLZX take a look i added some classes to the anchor tag but still nothing
[13:06:14] <robertmaxrees> you need to add the js duder.,
[13:06:29] <wendo3233> this is the whole js
[13:06:36] <robertmaxrees> not jquery lol
[13:06:40] <robertmaxrees> the js from the so answer.
[13:10:07] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/bmkqfqpb/
[13:10:10] <robertmaxrees> pretty basic stuff.
[13:10:24] <wendo3233> robertmaxrees
[13:10:33] <wendo3233> ok i did http://codepen.io/anon/pen/zvYLZX
[13:10:36] <wendo3233> still same thing
[13:10:51] <robertmaxrees> where is your javascript?
[13:10:59] <wendo3233> all the way on the bottom
[13:11:08] <wendo3233> look
[13:11:09] <robertmaxrees> i'm not seeing it.
[13:11:09] <wendo3233>  $(function(){       var navMain = $(".navbar-header");      navMain.on("click", "a", null, function () {          navMain.collapse('hide');      });  });
[13:11:11] <robertmaxrees> check the fiddle.
[13:11:18] <robertmaxrees> and you need to adjust the selectors.
[13:11:25] <wendo3233> i did
[13:11:31] <robertmaxrees> not correctly.
[13:11:34] <wendo3233> i adjusyed them
[13:11:40] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/bmkqfqpb/
[13:11:42] <robertmaxrees> check this out.
[13:11:49] <wendo3233> http://codepen.io/anon/pen/zvYLZX
[13:12:24] <robertmaxrees> i'm not seeing your code in there anywhere.
[13:12:40] <wendo3233> robert jsfiddle has a bug
[13:12:42] <wendo3233> {"error": "Please use POST request"}
[13:12:50] <robertmaxrees> wat
[13:12:52] <wendo3233> this is what im getting on the page
[13:12:54] <robertmaxrees> i'm not seeing that.
[13:13:08] <wendo3233> yeah jsfiddle never worked on my computer
[13:13:16] <wendo3233> :/
[13:13:24] <robertmaxrees> that's a really bad sign.
[13:13:28] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/bmkqfqpb/1/
[13:13:30] <robertmaxrees> try this one.
[13:13:31] <robertmaxrees> better?
[13:13:36] <wendo3233> one sec
[13:14:01] <robertmaxrees> and you're loading jquery and bootstrap weird.
[13:14:11] <wendo3233> robert same thing when i click on the run it says in the result {"error": "Please use POST request"}
[13:14:19] <wendo3233> yep
[13:14:29] <robertmaxrees> you should probably investigate why your browser is functioning like that.
[13:14:44] <wendo3233> dont know
[13:14:55] <wendo3233> but i have js turned on completely so it should not be a problem
[13:15:14] <wendo3233> robertmaxrees
[13:15:23] <robertmaxrees> http://codepen.io/anon/pen/bVGjyj
[13:15:24] <wendo3233> could you help me fix the code ?
[13:15:29] <robertmaxrees> see how i've loaded jquery and bootstrap here?
[13:15:36] <robertmaxrees> update that pen and save it - share out the link when you're done.
[13:16:18] <wendo3233> hold on
[13:16:26] <robertmaxrees> http://i.imgur.com/WUCMcfd.png if you click that gear icon on the html pane, you get this modal.  load external js and css through that instead.
[13:19:26] <wendo3233> robertmaxrees take a look http://codepen.io/anon/pen/GpRBby
[13:19:45] <robertmaxrees> your selectors are still wrong.
[13:20:04] <robertmaxrees> http://codepen.io/anon/pen/bVGjyj
[13:20:05] <wendo3233> one sec
[13:20:50] <wendo3233> robertmaxrees IT WORKS !
[13:20:54] <wendo3233> wow
[13:21:03] <robertmaxrees> like i said, your selectors were bad.
[13:21:04] <wendo3233> omg thank you so much
[13:21:12] <wendo3233> you were right
[13:21:18] <wendo3233> dude you are the boss
[13:21:20] <wendo3233> honestly
[13:21:22] <wendo3233> thanks
[13:21:25] <robertmaxrees> google mano.
[13:21:33] <wendo3233> i been struggling with this for few hours
[13:21:38] <wendo3233> mano ?
[13:21:48] <robertmaxrees> different way to say "man"
[13:22:07] <wendo3233> ohh
[13:22:30] <wendo3233> honstly this was a big problem for me the menu thing
[13:22:44] <robertmaxrees> your answer was a guick google search away :)
[13:22:50] <wendo3233> i dont usually use jquery or js but i had to use it for this project
[13:23:10] <wendo3233> yeah but you know its always easier with two people when you code
[13:23:17] <robertmaxrees> i disagree :)
[13:23:22] <wendo3233> really ?
[13:23:25] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[13:23:25] <wendo3233> how come ?
[13:23:38] <wendo3233> when you run into a problem then the other guy might know the answer
[13:23:47] <robertmaxrees> i'm pretty self sufficient these days.
[13:24:04] <wendo3233> do you do jquery or other langauges as well ?
[13:24:10] <robertmaxrees> jquery's not a language.
[13:24:17] <robertmaxrees> and i do a lot of different things.
[13:24:18] <wendo3233> yeah i understand
[13:24:21] <wendo3233> i mean like php
[13:24:25] <wendo3233> or rby
[13:24:26] <wendo3233> ruby
[13:24:41] <robertmaxrees> js front and back, coldfusion (yuck), java, python, c#...
[13:24:51] <wendo3233> oh wow
[13:24:57] <wendo3233> how long you been programming ?
[13:25:35] <robertmaxrees> that's a tough question.  i can't remember when i first started.  I want to say like 8 years or so but i could totally be off.
[13:25:48] <wendo3233> thats pretty good
[13:26:26] <wendo3233> robertmaxrees
[13:26:49] <wendo3233> do you know if its possible to achieve encryption in php for example but something like sha256 ?
[13:27:04] <robertmaxrees> i don't work with PHP, but I'm pretty sure you can.
[13:27:25] <wendo3233> thats cool then
[13:28:01] <wendo3233> im so happy that this actually works
[13:28:19] <wendo3233> when the code works, its always a good feeling
[14:06:23] <wendo3233> robertmaxrees ?
[14:12:10] <wendo3233> robertmaxrees what happend is that te function to hide the menu will work but the function for displaying other pages won't
[14:12:38] <robertmaxrees> lol there are over 600 people in this channel - you don't need to ask me ;)
[14:12:40] <robertmaxrees> and share your code.
[14:12:56] <wendo3233> yeah i know sorry you just been really helpful
[14:13:22] <wendo3233> i added some code to it but idk if they need to be combined
[14:13:23] <wendo3233> http://codepen.io/anon/pen/XmWPgK
[14:13:44] <robertmaxrees> they absolutely should be combined.
[14:14:01] <NitroLiq> Can I get some logic help? I'm trying to proto a basic nav that slides divs in/out on click. Here's what I have so far
[14:14:04] <NitroLiq> http://codepen.io/anon/pen/medGEx
[14:14:16] <wendo3233> oh wow
[14:14:27] <wendo3233> yeah thats why only one works
[14:14:29] <robertmaxrees> okay.  so what next?
[14:14:35] <robertmaxrees> NitroLiq what do you need?
[14:15:12] <wendo3233> robert could you help when you get a chance ?
[14:15:17] <robertmaxrees> wendo3233 with what?
[14:15:34] <wendo3233> with combing those two functions
[14:15:35] <robertmaxrees> wendo3233 try things.  show me you're putting in effort :)
[14:15:43] <wendo3233> ok
[14:15:45] <robertmaxrees> try combining them.  if it doesn't work, show me what you have and i'll help you.
[14:15:50] <wendo3233> let me see
[14:15:52] <wendo3233> ok
[14:15:56] <NitroLiq> Essentially, I need to click one of the menu items, have it slide in, then when I click another one, slide out and have the other one slide in
[14:16:35] <NitroLiq> I was looking at slideToggle() but wasn't sure how to use with the css positioning
[14:16:46] <robertmaxrees> i wouldn't use slidetoggle.
[14:17:05] <NitroLiq> I think I may have a solution of sorts in one of my books.
[14:17:18] <robertmaxrees> add a class to the one you're sliding out, then on click, find that class and animate it closed.
[14:17:19] <NitroLiq> looping through
[14:17:25] <robertmaxrees> no need to loop anything.
[14:18:28] <NitroLiq> I think that's what the book does.  I was just trying to make it less specific and more of a re-usable function.
[14:18:37] <robertmaxrees> why?
[14:19:03] <robertmaxrees> i mean, do you plan on using it elsewhere?  that's one of those basic things where I wouldn't spend the time making an ultra generic version.
[14:19:29] <NitroLiq> To set up general slide functionality for any menu items without specifically using their classes
[14:19:46] <robertmaxrees> that's what i'm suggesting to you.
[14:19:57] <sgs03> why might a nested div not show when I call .show() on its parent div?
[14:20:09] <NitroLiq> I don't know at this point. I'm creating a sort of kitchen sink header proto that will eventually be used on a bunch of different projects
[14:20:36] <robertmaxrees> ah i see where you're stuck.
[14:20:43] <robertmaxrees> one sec i'll show you.
[14:23:21] <robertmaxrees> http://codepen.io/anon/pen/BoaOwv
[14:23:30] <robertmaxrees> NitroLiq so this is one way to abstract the open part.
[14:26:09] <Elyx00> robertmaxrees, why not animate with css transition :o ?
[14:26:16] <robertmaxrees> could do that instead.
[14:26:23] <robertmaxrees> working off of his original
[14:26:35] <Elyx00> Oh np.
[14:27:03] <NitroLiq> Shouldn't that affect each menu item?
[14:27:14] <robertmaxrees> i only set it up for one of them.
[14:27:19] <robertmaxrees> see the data attribute?
[14:27:26] <robertmaxrees> i had to modify the markup.
[14:27:51] <NitroLiq> ah yeah
[14:31:10] <wendo3233> robertmaxrees im confused what is wrong  i added to js what needs to be done when the anchor tag is clicked but still get nothing  the http://codepen.io/anon/pen/rONZYL?editors=101
[14:31:37] <wendo3233> i dont get any related errors to it
[14:31:47] <robertmaxrees> so what isn't happening then?
[14:31:52] <robertmaxrees> what about it doesn't work?
[14:32:16] <wendo3233> well it does not want to work with that other code that fetches the data from other pages
[14:32:28] <wendo3233> i can only get one to work but not both together
[14:32:47] <wendo3233> i commented out the good code that was used before
[14:32:48] <robertmaxrees> so what happens with this example?
[14:33:22] <wendo3233> well basically it will open the menu then when you click on the link it will redirect to another page
[14:33:43] <robertmaxrees> so you mean it's opening the links and the ajax isn't running?
[14:33:51] <wendo3233> yes
[14:33:52] <wendo3233> exactly
[14:34:02] <robertmaxrees> is your code in head?
[14:34:06] <robertmaxrees> or before the closing body tag?
[14:34:22] <wendo3233> everything is in the head
[14:34:28] <wendo3233> well the
[14:34:39] <wendo3233> one that uses the ajax loading
[14:34:44] <robertmaxrees> that's why.
[14:34:45] <wendo3233> its actually on a seperate file
[14:34:50] <robertmaxrees> you need to wrap it in a document ready.
[14:34:52] <wendo3233> and its included in every page
[14:34:58] <wendo3233> but its in header
[14:34:59] <robertmaxrees> http://codepen.io/anon/pen/rONZdM?editors=101
[14:35:37] <wendo3233> one sec
[14:36:45] <robertmaxrees> you should check out learn.jquery.com
[14:37:11] <wendo3233> robertmaxrees, its still the same thing
[14:37:15] <robertmaxrees> dunno then.
[14:37:20] <wendo3233> i know its just hard
[14:37:52] <robertmaxrees> oh.
[14:38:03] <robertmaxrees> are the links loaded as apart of that .load() deal?
[14:38:05] <wendo3233> i did not know this will be an issue
[14:38:11] <wendo3233> yes
[14:38:14] <robertmaxrees> that's why.
[14:38:20] <wendo3233> just the content loads
[14:38:41] <robertmaxrees> right, but the <a> tags in the navigation are in #content, right?
[14:39:07] <wendo3233> no
[14:39:26] <wendo3233> the content is a div basically
[14:39:39] <wendo3233> where i have the data for it on few different pages
[14:39:53] <wendo3233> the navbar links are only on one page
[14:40:00] <robertmaxrees> dunno then man.  i'd have to see a live example.
[14:40:52] <robertmaxrees> could see if something like http://codepen.io/anon/pen/rONZdM?editors=101 works.
[14:41:10] <wendo3233> one momemnt
[14:41:26] <robertmaxrees> if not, fixingthesejquery.com and learn.jquery.com will be some good resources for you.
[14:42:00] <gambl0re> jquery docs is also good..
[14:44:18] <wendo3233> robertmaxrees its still the same thing :/ what do you think we should try ?
[14:44:25] <robertmaxrees> *you
[14:44:33] <robertmaxrees> and you should check out those links.
[14:44:38] <robertmaxrees> without seeing it, there's not much we can do.
[14:45:04] <wendo3233> but i wont be able to learn this in couple days
[14:45:11] <wendo3233> im like behind work actually
[14:45:23] <robertmaxrees> dunno what to tell you, then.
[14:45:32] <robertmaxrees> like, i don't have enough information to help you at this point.
[14:46:40] <wendo3233> do you think there is another way i should do this
[14:46:45] <robertmaxrees> i'
[14:46:47] <wendo3233> so i dont use the menu thing
[14:46:56] <robertmaxrees> i have no idea what problem you're trying to solve.

[14:48:30] <wendo3233> Use of getPreventDefault() is deprecated.  Use defaultPrevented instead.
[14:48:40] <robertmaxrees> yeah that you can safely ignore.
[14:49:06] <wendo3233> and
[14:49:07] <wendo3233> The Web Console logging API (console.log, console.info, console.warn, console.error) has been disabled by a script on this page.

[14:53:57] <wendo3233> i could not done it without you
[14:58:06] <robertmaxrees> hey, it's how i give back.  but thanks!
[14:58:15] <NitroLiq> Elyx00 I'm using jquery over css transitions because I need to be able to toggle the div animation based on which menu item is clicked
[14:58:35] <NitroLiq> Maybe I'm overthinking this
[14:58:36] <robertmaxrees> NitroLiq you could addclass/removeclass to control that.
[14:58:48] <Elyx00> ^
[14:59:17] <NitroLiq> Hmm
[14:59:53] <NitroLiq> I just need to be careful of other 'active' classes
[15:02:46] <Dr-007> with jquery when trying to find the height of a content inside the iframe the iframe can not be hidden?
[15:02:54] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[15:03:06] <Dr-007> and if if the iframe is inside a container and the container is hidden
[15:03:09] <Dr-007> +?
[15:03:14] <robertmaxrees> pretty much.
[15:03:18] <Dr-007> aight
[15:03:22] <robertmaxrees> iirc the content needs to be visible.
[15:03:33] <robertmaxrees> or otherwise rendered.
[15:04:41] <Dr-007> yes, but if the container is hidden the content of the iframe will be hidden to. so then i still can't measure the iframe's content height. right?
[15:05:10] <robertmaxrees> right. because it's not rendered.
[15:05:26] <robertmaxrees> why do you want that information?
[15:07:09] <Dr-007> i'm showing a preload while the iframe is loading inside a bootstrap modalbox. when the iframe is finally done loading the preloader will be hidden the iframe will be shown and the height of the iframe will be adjusted to the contents of the iframe
[15:07:35] <robertmaxrees> why not just use an overlay of some kind instead?
[15:07:54] <Dr-007> i don't follow
[15:08:05] <robertmaxrees> instead of hiding/showing the iframe, just stick a div over it.
[15:08:25] <Dr-007> ah
[15:08:49] <Dr-007> thats alot of work
[15:09:02] <robertmaxrees> less work than what you're currently trying to do haha
[15:09:02] <Dr-007> if the viewport of the div is just one pixel at first
[15:09:06] <Dr-007> will it render then?
[15:09:12] <robertmaxrees> maybe?
[15:09:20] <robertmaxrees> this feels really weird though.
[15:09:39] <Dr-007> iframes?
[15:10:07] <robertmaxrees> right, why is the div overlay not okay?
[15:10:34] <wendo3233> robertmaxrees thanks again and take care
[15:11:03] <Dr-007> because i dont know the height
[15:11:12] <Dr-007> so it will pop out below
[15:11:23] <Dr-007> creating a scrollbar inside the modalbox
[15:11:23] <robertmaxrees> technically you can never know the height.
[15:11:38] <robertmaxrees> until the whole thing is done loading.
[15:11:43] <Dr-007> yeah i know
[15:11:46] <Dr-007> that part is done
[15:12:04] <Dr-007> but i wasn't hiding the iframe a few minutes ago
[15:12:13] <Dr-007> so all of a sudden the resize part wasn't working anymore
[15:12:28] <robertmaxrees> so don't hide it and read the height thatway to get that data.
[15:12:57] <Dr-007> jup jup, im implementing something
[15:12:59] <Dr-007> thanks :)
[15:13:03] <robertmaxrees> :) awesome.
[15:13:03] <Dr-007> (once again!)
[15:19:53] <lindii_> is there any other way to add an active class using "popstate" other than doing this https://jsfiddle.net/zh5q142s/
[15:20:38] <robertmaxrees> what url gets pushed in?
[15:21:54] <lindii_> works fine. I just dont like doing var url = $(".nav-tabs li a[href$='" + location.href.replace(/^.*\/\/[^\/]+/, '') + "']");
[15:21:58] <lindii_> looks kinda nasty
[15:25:12] <robertmaxrees> i'm lost.
[15:25:15] <robertmaxrees> what is that trying to grab?
[15:25:46] <robertmaxrees> the path in the url, yeah?
[15:26:41] <robertmaxrees> lindii_ because it looks like you want window.location.pathname
[15:28:50] <lindii_> robertmaxrees: i only want to change the "active" class based on the url, so basically im grabing the url that way
[15:29:33] <lindii_> unless theres anothe way
[15:31:40] <robertmaxrees> what is the regex grabbing?
[15:36:28] <lindii_> robertmaxrees: sorry.. that regex is leaving the domain out
[15:52:53] <fas3r> hello, is it possible to catch the event of a input type file, after that the user select the file and clicked on "open" ?
[15:59:30] <robertmaxrees> lindii_ yeah, you can use window.location.path to get the path of the url.
[16:00:05] <lindii_> will try that
[16:25:50] <SmashingX> how can I add the delete icon to the next of the Loading.. text in the square http://jsfiddle.net/1ef3u4md/
[16:25:58] <SmashingX> I’ve been trying for a while
[16:26:33] <SmashingX> it’s jquery mobile by the way
[16:29:58] <robertmaxrees> data-role="button"
[16:30:02] <robertmaxrees> removing that partially fixes it.
[16:30:24] <SmashingX_> sorry bad connection
[16:30:48] <robertmaxrees> removing data-role="button" partially fixes it.
[16:33:13] <SmashingX> mhh you are right
[16:33:40] <SmashingX> I wonder if I won’t lose the onclick functionality
[16:34:52] <SmashingX> robertmaxrees: why do you think is that robertmaxrees ?
[16:35:18] <SmashingX> in their website they specify data-role=“button"
[16:35:20] <SmashingX> http://demos.jquerymobile.com/1.2.1/docs/buttons/buttons-icons.html
[16:47:44] <alberto> hello
[16:48:05] <alberto> is it possible to add ajax settings directly in post/get method ?
[16:48:16] <robertmaxrees> what do you mean?
[16:48:36] <alberto> for example add ContentType or processData
[16:49:54] <robertmaxrees> in $.get() and $.post()
[16:50:19] <alberto> yes
[16:50:45] <robertmaxrees> not until version 3.
[16:50:48] <robertmaxrees> just use $.ajax()
[16:52:09] <alberto> so basically it's not possible to send file with post except using $.ajax
[16:52:14] <alberto> until v3 :).
[16:52:17] <alberto> thanks.
[17:09:37] <dlam> is there a way to remove all  event listeners of window scroll?
[17:11:02] <robertmaxrees> $(window).off('scroll')
[17:11:07] <robertmaxrees> i'd avoid that though
[18:12:42] <kingplusplus> hi guys, after login users get redirected to http://site.com/success/ by default the success script displays 10 comments how do i make it work with ajax
[18:14:55] <kanja> Is there a function like ansestor/parents/closest that will traverse siblings of each ansestor?
[18:21:54] <Alchemy> hey all if I have a DOM reference how do I get a textual representation of everything below it
[19:56:34] <alturic> hey guys, i have a .hover function that fires when you hover over something (duh), and it works fine on pageload BUT, I also have a function that changes the .html of that container. Now the actual selector exits in the replaced .html but it doesn't fire after the .html replace... is that normal functionality?
[19:58:00] <alturic> So the actual .hover function that fires on the hovered button still exists in the replaced .html, but it no longer works once the .html replace would have replaced the html.
[19:59:45] <alturic> http://jsfiddle.net/bjra624f/ is a fiddle.
[20:33:45] <Phoenixz> I'm using jquery validator with the remote: URL option, and I have a problem that I need to click the submit button twice.. Now I know this is due to the asynchronous way the ajax calls work, but I would have thought that this remote option would keep that in mind.. Is there any documented way to fix this without using async: false ?
[20:33:58] <Phoenixz> Because that's currently the only option I've found, and I think it kinda sucks
