[02:09:39] <esko> guys im making a ajax get with select2 but i get bracket encodings in my request, like so: http://localhost:5000/api/docs?term%5Bterm%5D=asd, whereas i expect: http://localhost:5000/api/docs?term=asd
[02:10:30] <esko> any ideas why that might be?
[02:11:26] <Evolutio> use srealize
[02:11:30] <Evolutio> *seralize
[02:11:45] <esko> on the term?
[02:12:50] <Evolutio> var data = $('#form').seralize();  $.get('url?data='+data)..
[02:12:50] <Evolutio> http://api.jquery.com/serialize/
[02:12:59] <Evolutio> look at the bottom there is an example
[02:14:53] <petzup> hy i have problem here with moving left/right elements http://jsfiddle.net/92fc5nfe/, if i hover div i get buttons but i cannot click them because they are out of range of <article>
[02:16:10] <Evolutio> @petzup   We're truly sorry, but there is no such page.
[02:17:00] <petzup> Evolutio, which page?
[02:17:13] <Evolutio> http://jsfiddle.net/92fc5nfe/
[02:17:18] <Evolutio> this page does not exist
[02:17:23] <petzup> http://jsfiddle.net/92fc5nfe/1/
[02:18:03] <petzup> this should work i think
[02:19:09] <Evolutio> i hope, i solved this problem
[02:19:10] <Evolutio> http://jsfiddle.net/92fc5nfe/2/
[02:20:17] <Evolutio> when i click on the button the text from the "tag3" changes to "tag4"
[02:20:42] <petzup> Evolutio, try to hover on first article and hover the next button, it disapers..
[02:20:49] <Evolutio> yes
[02:20:55] <petzup> ok it's blinking
[02:21:05] <Evolutio> :D
[02:21:12] <petzup> but can't really use it, soo firstly i would need fix for that
[02:21:20] <Evolutio> wait a moment
[02:21:44] <petzup> somehow, if mouse leaver thhis article but doenst leave nearest div control don't remove this div or something...

[07:34:18] <Norkas> any way to do this?

[07:41:40] <cjohnson> or tried adding the attribute to those extra columns on the second line?
[07:43:04] <Norkas> sure i added data-priority="1,2 or 3" to each line, didnt work
[08:25:44] <doug16k> bl4ckdu5t, window scrolls, not document
[08:27:00] <doug16k> something wrong with toggleClass?
[08:28:57] <doug16k> bl4ckdu5t, http://codepen.io/anon/pen/VYxwNX

[09:13:21] <Valduare> something to do with being in a modal?
[09:14:22] <kesshi> Hi, if i use jquery contents() on an iframe inside a page, i get the content of the page and not the contents of the iframe page
[09:14:29] <kesshi> http://jsfiddle.net/813eebds/
[09:14:48] <kesshi> the iframe page is also from my server
[09:21:02] <Valduare> ok I added a delay to the animation and I can see that it IS animating but its showing them all at same time and acting like the page has already scrolled

[11:32:47] <Aldus_> Hi. I have a problem in a callback function that is executed after using .load()  or $.ajax undependently. I am trying to bind an event to all the <a> elements in the loaded code, but apparently that's not working, while it attaches the event to all existing <a> elements. BUT if I try in a dirty way doing .attr('onclick', '...') it works on both. Check http://pastebin.com/2zqaDEd9
[11:56:51] <gregor3005> hi, can anybody point me in the right direction. i try to add a navigation which slides up and down through the main menu and left right through the submenus. which terms i have to search, i found the swipe navigation. but it swipes only left/right or up/down not both
[12:00:50] <falieson> how do I grab the javascript object 'foo'  from <script>var foo = '...' ? some googling pointed me to $('script').text(jQuery.inArray('foo'))  but that isn't correct
[12:12:14] <falieson> how do I grab the contents of var foo from a script tag https://gist.github.com/Falieson/65ff35f28a91ae955429 ?
[12:12:28] <simon> falieson, maybe be a little more precise. how do you mean grab? do you mean search the DOM for one or more tags that look like this, or that actual tag object (that isn't in the DOM, but resides in foo)?
[12:12:47] <simon> falieson, simply refer to the variable foo?
[12:13:31] <falieson> simon, I'm using cheerio in node which parses the html into a jquery like object but doesn't load the full dom so I can't just go $(foo)
[12:14:41] <simon> oh. *shrug*
[12:19:14] <falieson> anyone else? $('script') returns an array of all the <script> tags, how do I find the tag with the contents var foo and then set the contents of var foo to a variable? https://gist.github.com/Falieson/65ff35f28a91ae955429
[12:23:23] <apb1963>  I'm trying to use this table plugin....  http://www.jtable.org/GettingStarted#Introduction    but I can't get it to work.  Can anyone else get it to work?  It seems so simple, there's very little code there, don't know what I could be doing wrong.
[12:26:55] <falieson> I added how I've done it before, with an xpath reference and being able to use map(&:text) which errors when I try to use it in jQuery (unexpected token &)
[12:35:56] <_eddy> hi guys how do i submit this form http://jsfiddle.net/baako/s9b45440/ without refreshing the page?

[13:17:54] <LoneElf> Hey guys, if I have a div with and id #foo, and a button inside of that div, how do I set the on click action for that button?
[13:18:36] <marahin> Hey guys! My app has implemented bootstrap in it, yet it needs to use JQuery UI's dialog. Is there any way to comfort those two, so the JQuery-Ui's dialog will have an appearing "X" close button (in top right corner)? I've tried Javascript include ordering, however it doesn't seem to work on production environment
[13:19:38] <LoneElf> I've lifted the short example from http://bootboxjs.com/ ("Compare that to the code youâ€™d have to write without Bootbox" heading)... But none of the callbacks that I wire up seem to work for some reason?
[14:02:32] <doug16k> bl4ckdu5t, I already sent you a fix

[15:21:01] <caz> Hi, I encountering an issue while trying to serializeArray my form. It's working well but I wonder why it does not serialize to json as I want : { "itemName" : "itemValue" } but instead it does "[{"name":"itemName","value":"itemValue"}]"
[15:23:16] <caz> As the method serializeArray seems to work this way, how can I get simplified json response?

[16:01:18] <_eddy> ?
[16:01:39] <stylica> I found it out: I have to pass the csfr token as json attribute as all the other data.
[17:29:51] <cuppy> Why is it that so often, responsive design relies on JS/jQuery parsing x, y, width, height according to a set ratio such as screenwidth/1000 as opposed to using percentages via CSS?
