[01:07:27] <RajRajRaj> I want to use the result of document.getElementsByClassName('class with space in name') in jquery to fire event. how?
[01:42:20] <pavonia> RajRajRaj: Why don't you want to use jQuery to select the element?
[01:42:56] <pavonia> Alos, class names can't have spaces
[01:43:01] <pavonia> *Also
[04:23:13] <derek_> I have a JQuery mobile app I"m testing. I'm doing document.getElementById('img-source-preview').src = 'pathToImage';
[04:23:55] <derek_> when I check the .src element, it shows the new value, but the page doesn't render the update. If I update the html in the debugger to manually set the html to <img id="img-source-preview" src="pathToImage"> it works.
[04:24:27] <derek_> I've tested this as a basic case in my browser and it also works as expected. So I can only assume there is something amiss in the JQuery / Cordova frameworks between my code and the app
[04:24:51] <Doc-Saintly> Any ideas?

[08:44:41] <lolita> where are you
[09:01:58] <madprops> is there a reason why .html(x) would be asynch? it seems to not do it before an alert is called
[09:03:55] <Neo_122> busy )
[10:01:05] <shoky> madprops: alert() blocks the browser from doing any work like rendering any html you appended. the .html(x) itself is not async (i.e. the DOM has updated already, just the changes have not been rendered yet)
[10:01:15] <shoky> conclusion: don't use alert()
[10:01:47] <madprops> im trying to look for an alternative already
[10:01:53] <madprops> but im not finding something i like
[10:01:57] <madprops> probably gonna have to do it myself
[10:21:57] <Sircle> any react guys?
[12:09:14] <nnn_> hi
[12:09:21] <nnn_> hello guys
[14:17:37] <ReScO> https://i.imgur.com/w1wTB1b.png does anyone here know a jQ plugin for Bootstrap 4 that does what you see in the image?
[14:18:15] <Duikb00t-home> What you mean?
[14:18:29] <ReScO> Label filtering, basically a dropdown multi-select
[14:18:40] <ReScO> Can't find it anywhere
[16:13:37] <darkhexx> Hi guys
[16:14:57] <darkhexx> im trying to animate background-size with jquery
[16:15:06] <darkhexx> with values in vh
[16:15:26] <darkhexx> and while it works great on chrome and opera it doesnt work on firefox
[16:17:16] <darkhexx> instead of animating from previous background-size it animates from 1000vh to target value
[17:26:15] <skinux> Do you guys using jQuery to monitor+manipulate data in a specialized spreadsheet type of web application?
[17:27:54] <skinux> I may have been told not to do it that way before, don't remember. I need for rows of text inputs (cells) to be deletable and edited without changing the scroll position.
[17:28:16] <skinux> I'll be right back, need to restart and upgrade browser.
[18:01:07] <dlog> i think i have a problem with multiple dialogs, i cant get the "val()" of if dialog 2 or 3 or 4 etc is open i can only get "val()" of dialog 1 https://jsfiddle.net/q41oqkdx/
[19:25:13] <aFeijo> hi folks
[19:26:26] <aFeijo> I have a code that have an weird behavior, its an autocompleteselect event from a text field, that I need to change its value, it doesnt work from that event, only from the blur event! no matter what I do, the original text value stays
[19:31:03] <aFeijo> I think I know what is going on, the autocompleteselect event is finishing after mine, so it overwrite my value, making my code inert. Anyway I can do my code execute afterwards? Or tell the event to use my value?
[19:36:03] <aFeijo> not even    preventDefault()  helps
[20:44:46] <scroll> How can I scrollTop() based on previousElementSibling.firstElementChild
[22:37:39] <aFeijo> why can I change the value of my text field in a autocompleteselect event?
[23:16:26] <aFeijo> well, not pretty but setTimeout did the trick for me!! LOL
[23:16:43] <aFeijo> with just 5 ms, I dont think this will backfire in any scenario
