[04:40:45] <Absolum> I am trying to create a proxy object for an alignment demo. The proxy object has a "source" attribute that is passed a jquery object. However, it passes {0:{...}, length:1} instead of the jquery object. Any idea why? I'll post code
[16:10:48] <robertmaxrees> Absolum you figure it out? :)
[16:42:48] <Destramic> how can i apply agruments to a function please? https://jsfiddle.net/thoexvr5/
[16:43:45] <robertmaxrees> Destramic that's a basic JS question, but apply takes an array, not an object.
[16:43:58] <robertmaxrees> and the first argument in apply this whatever you want the 'this' to be.  https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/apply
[16:49:29] <Destramic> robertmaxrees thank you, https://jsfiddle.net/thoexvr5/1/   it works but also logs undefined, undefined in console =/
[16:50:02] <robertmaxrees> right.
[16:50:10] <robertmaxrees> because your two functions don't return anything.
[16:51:00] <Destramic> :) https://jsfiddle.net/thoexvr5/2/
[16:51:03] <robertmaxrees> console.log(hello(), bye()); is printing out whatever those functions return.
[16:51:11] <Destramic> robertmaxrees thank you
[16:51:21] <robertmaxrees> tho i gotta ask - whatcha using apply for?
[16:58:26] <Destramic> robertmaxrees im making a container https://jsfiddle.net/thoexvr5/3/    working as i want it now
[16:59:12] <Destramic> robertmaxrees any suggestions would be greatful, im converting from php to js :) i see the light lol
[17:00:19] <robertmaxrees> "container"?  looks like some kind of dependency manager.
[17:00:32] <Destramic> robertmaxrees yes it is
[17:00:38] <robertmaxrees> then why not use webpack?
[17:00:44] <robertmaxrees> or some other manager?
[17:01:12] <Destramic> robertmaxrees never heard of it, plus i like to right my own things, to a certain degree, that way i can try and learn js
[17:01:22] <Destramic> write****
[17:01:37] <robertmaxrees> learning to use those tools will do you much more good than re-inventing the wheel :)
[17:02:09] <Destramic> robertmaxrees you r
[17:02:13] <robertmaxrees> also fwiw: don't use var, use let instead.
[17:02:27] <Destramic> robertmaxrees your right, plus i probably would of finished my project by now
[17:02:41] <Destramic> robertmaxrees thank you
[17:03:16] <robertmaxrees> and your usage of ! is going to confuse people.  and avoid for loops.
[17:04:02] <Destramic> how else would i use !name in this.dependencies
[17:04:18] <Destramic> use each instead?
[17:04:53] <robertmaxrees> !(name in this.dependencies) at the very least.  or swap everything to use arrays and then you unlock every, some, etc.  and in your case, you want map.
[17:07:24] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/938xzh6r/ something like this.  though really - don't build out something like this yourself.
[17:07:39] <Destramic> robertmaxrees i had to check out what EVERY was, but now i know...i need a obj though and array wouldnt place a name and a func in
[17:08:03] <robertmaxrees> you want an array of objects with a name and function.
[17:08:13] <robertmaxrees> but again - don't solve these problems on your own :)
[17:08:48] <Destramic> robertmaxrees you jsfiddle didnt work, and who will solve them if i wont? lol
[17:08:48] <robertmaxrees> rather, don't solve them yourself.  there's a reason folks reach for pre-built solutions.
[17:09:09] <robertmaxrees> i'm saying these kinds of issues are already solved, so use something preexisting.
[17:09:56] <Destramic> robertmaxrees i know your right, but i enjoy writing it myself...ps. im backwards lol
[17:10:48] <robertmaxrees> :shrug: do you. just saying - if the goal is to learn, then doing it this way is only going to do you a disservice :)
[17:14:17] <Destramic> robertmaxrees i'd kind of agree with you if i was a developer working for a company or freelance, but thats never gonna happen...just coding towards the app and dream in my big head lol
[17:15:28] <robertmaxrees> those tools also help you better organize your projects for the long-term and will make it more modular and easier to maintain.  but hey, what do i know :o)
[17:20:16] <Destramic> robertmaxrees i don't write everything, but i do have a library, for instance ive been wriring a auth script, although i know theres loads out there, i just enjoy it :'(
[17:25:50] <Destramic> robertmaxrees thank you, i used your map function...also when you talked about putting the functions in an array instead of an object....like so?  https://jsfiddle.net/q9386uhw/
[17:44:34] <robertmaxrees> sure, but you said you needed a name for them.
[17:50:53] <Destramic> robertmaxrees thank you for your help, again
