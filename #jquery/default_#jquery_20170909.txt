[18:10:53] <tr0y> I need some help with an issue. I'm trying to manipulate an ajax response. I have a website that performs an ajax request for the next search results page. Every other page refreshes though. Basically $(document).ready() will fire my code & inject my dynamically generated button, but when I click to the next search results page, I can't insert my buttons.
[18:15:26] <tr0y> I tried using $(document).ajaxComplete() to try to insert after the ajax response, but that didn't work. I tried overwriting the dynamic element with a modified ajax response, but for some reason the images in the page wouldn't load.

[19:41:29] <pavonia> Show your code for inserting the buttons
[19:41:45] <tr0y> One sec.
[19:43:06] <tr0y> https://gist.github.com/tr0yspradling/f76771c00d9cd7d6cbc4319fb58f0f4a
[19:43:19] <tr0y> That's the current working code.
[19:45:04] <tr0y> this is the code i was testing to replace the content with the modified ajax response

[19:49:30] <pavonia> Where do you insert the buttons in the AJAX handler?
[19:52:11] <tr0y> Look in the .ajaxComplete function in the second link
[23:38:47] <JordiGH> I'm doing $.ajax(...).done(....) but the request is returning a 302 instead of a 200. As far as I'm concerned, 302 is a success. How can I tell the ajax objct this?
