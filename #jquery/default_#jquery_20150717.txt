[00:28:08] <rflx> hi all; is it possible to call the .map() function equalizeHeights() on $window.resize? The function calls only when the page is loaded with the additional trigger function. Any hints on this? Thx
[00:59:49] <Cork> rflx: make a fiddle
[01:06:03] <rflx> Cork: ok, just a sec.
[01:07:46] <hellyeah> $(this).parent().parent(). addClass("foo"). removeClass("bar"); part of fp i guess "higher orde r function)
[01:12:44] <Xatenev> heya
[01:12:44] <Xatenev> a question, I have some data like this: {"salutation":"Title","firstname":"FirstName","lastname":"LastName","company":"Company","country":"Country","email":"myemail@whatever.de","phone":"12313"} - now I want to get all elements with the id same as all those json keys and save the value into it
[01:12:59] <Xatenev> how would I start that?
[01:13:25] <Xatenev> for example I have an input field <input id="lastname">
[01:13:33] <hellyeah> salutation, title, first name is id?
[01:13:35] <Xatenev> then I wnana do #lastname.val(myJsonKey)
[01:13:38] <Xatenev> yep
[01:13:55] <hellyeah> i am kinda newbie but i read about two methods
[01:14:05] <hellyeah> JSON. parse and JSON.stringify
[01:14:15] <hellyeah> may be worth to check it out
[01:17:21] <Xatenev> ye with JSON.parse i got it into an object
[01:17:35] <Xatenev> but dunno how I would take a key, search for the element and put that value into the field
[01:17:36] <Xatenev> :/
[01:18:32] <hellyeah> so
[01:18:42] <hellyeah> hmm
[01:19:16] <hellyeah> did you check stringify?
[01:19:25] <hellyeah> may be you can use map
[01:19:46] <Cork> Xatenev: $.each loop the object
[01:19:55] <Cork> and then just fetch the value and set the result
[01:20:12] <AdamPDotty> request = JSON.parse(data);  #lastname.val(request['myJsonKey']);
[01:20:40] <Xatenev> Cork: ty
[01:21:34] <Cork> $.each(obj, function(id, value) { $('#' + id).val(value); });
[01:22:09] <Cork> Xatenev: also if you need to run JSON.parse it means you're server is broken
[01:22:59] <Xatenev> Cork: why?
[01:23:09] <Xatenev> Cork: when I do json_encode on serverside
[01:23:13] <Xatenev> I would prob have to parse it, no?
[01:23:18] <Cork> cause it means it sends json but lies and says it sends something else
[01:23:26] <Cork> (most likely text/html)
[01:23:35] <Cork> Xatenev: json_encode isn't enough
[01:23:45] <Cork> you need to set Content-Type too
[01:23:50] <Xatenev> Cork: oh
[01:23:55] <Xatenev> Cork: will do ty
[01:24:00] <Cork> else the server will still send html
[01:24:03] <phiz> set content type to ASCII
[01:24:13] <Cork> and it will just be html without tags and with text in it
[01:24:17] <Cork> uh... no
[01:24:32] <Xatenev> Ok done
[01:24:34] <Xatenev> header('Content-Type: application/json');
[01:24:34] <Xatenev> echo json_encode($return);
[01:24:35] <phiz> oh I thought you meant you were pulling it in from a file n/m
[01:24:51] <Cork> yup
[01:24:58] <Cork> that should work
[01:25:35] <Xatenev> Cork: oh yeah I see
[01:25:38] <Xatenev> now JS automatically got the object
[01:25:40] <Xatenev> without the need of parse
[01:25:44] <Cork> yup
[01:25:50] <Xatenev> Aswell before I had a ewird error "Unexpoected token o"
[01:25:51] <Cork> cause js gets json instead of html
[01:25:58] <Xatenev> which is solved aswell now via the content type
[01:26:21] <Xatenev> Cork: cool as always, ty :P
[01:29:44] <rflx> Hi Cork, pls check out the fiddle https://jsfiddle.net/27btngy5/1/
[01:30:20] <Cork> rflx: your adding ready twice
[01:30:35] <Cork> $(function()) === $(document).ready(function() {})
[01:30:54] <Cork> and ready do .load internally so no need for it
[01:31:20] <rflx> I don't know but the .left div should adapt to the .bg div on resize
[01:32:30] <Cork> https://jsfiddle.net/27btngy5/2/
[01:33:22] <Cork> https://jsfiddle.net/27btngy5/4/
[01:34:41] <Cork> and to fix the white space at the bottom https://jsfiddle.net/27btngy5/5/
[01:35:03] <rflx> Thx Cork, btw. do you have any idea why the .left div is not adapting to the .bg div on resize?
[01:35:17] <rflx> oops.. will check,,, thx
[01:36:43] <Cork> ah
[01:37:02] <Cork> rflx: well ya, the write area at the bottom is cause js doesn't know about the new height of the img tag
[01:37:12] <Cork> ugg even worse
[01:37:16] <Cork> there isn't an img tag
[01:37:28] <Cork> and js doens't know the metrics of the img
[01:37:32] <Cork> (as it is in css)
[01:38:01] <Cork> rflx: so ya, to completely fix that you would have to move the background image to an img tag
[01:38:02] <rflx> yes thats my problem ;)
[01:38:24] <Cork> or allow the image to be cropped
[01:38:51] <rflx> that would be finde.. if the img would do the job like css cover
[01:39:06] <Cork> sure it would
[01:39:28] <Cork> set width: 100% and leave height undefined
[01:39:58] <rflx> thank you for your help! :)
[01:40:35] <rflx> would it be possible to set it to center center?
[01:42:34] <Cork> rflx: that would just spread the errors
[01:42:43] <Cork> the problem is background-size: cover
[01:43:07] <Cork> an option is to set background-size: 100% 100%;
[01:43:23] <Cork> but then it will distort the image
[01:46:07] <rflx> Cork: so my decision to use 100% height on the .right div was to apply it with display: table and vertically center a child div inside it.
[01:49:09] <Cork> rflx: the problem is that dom elements can't adjust there size to the dimensions of a background image
[01:50:32] <rflx> thank you for your hint Cork. Now i know the issue.. :/
[01:54:41] <sash_> I created a wp theme with jquery 2 included and it works quite nice, however, on Iphone 4S, everything sucks. Do I need jquery mobile or something?
[01:55:54] <rflx> Cork: but i dont understand why jQuery is not able to get the height of the .left div, the height is set with padding-bottom. Maybe there is a unterstanding problem on my side ;)
[01:58:29] <Cork> rflx: the plugin sets the heights of the two elements on load
[01:58:39] <Cork> as the height is set fixed it won't ever change after that
[01:59:04] <Cork> if you want to recalculate the height you have to unset the fixed height
[02:00:22] <rflx> okay.. i think i got it
[02:00:29] <rflx> thank you
[03:42:45] <jeffreylevesque> Is creating an upstart or systemd script to auto start uglifyjs strange?
[03:56:54] <greenit> hi, i have a problem with the datepicker (jquery) in JSF. when I write a date in the field with the pattern "17.7.15", the popup shows June 17th 2015 select. However, when i submit the form, it changes it to June 17th 0015... as this is not the only form this happens, can you tell me how I can fix this?
[04:18:25] <taplar> *scanning the log from yesterday* wow, another person asked about typing speed
[04:19:49] <arthurvr> taplar: why do people care
[04:20:18] <taplar> i dunno.  i guess they get the idea that typing speed equates to productivity
[04:36:46] <Uhkis> if typing speed is holding back your productivity, you're pretty damn hardcore coder :D
[04:37:33] <arc_> srsly
[04:38:03] <arc_> must look like the matrix
[04:41:24] <taplar> my brain holds back my productivity...... that and QAs
[04:42:04] <taplar> oh, and slow functional tests
[04:42:08] <taplar> *shakes fist*
[05:12:11] <toomus> Hi all
[05:12:16] <taplar> yo
[05:13:14] <toomus> How to iterate through set of elements with $.each, but from last to first element?
[05:13:34] <taplar> reverse them first?
[05:14:35] <piXonix_> Try this:
[05:15:06] <piXonix_> $($("li").get().reverse()).each(function() { /* ... */ });
[05:15:18] <Cork> toomus: or just use .slice
[05:15:18] <toomus> OK, let mi try :)
[05:15:27] <Cork> slice(1, -1).each()
[05:16:12] <Cork> ah, sorry
[05:16:16] <Cork> FROM last to first
[05:16:22] <Cork> read that as except...
[05:22:50] <toomus> piXonix_: THX, your solution do the job :)
[05:26:01] <piXonix_> cool
[05:37:31] <pokergod> What happens if you have a $.get(...) and then another click comes in..  The second  $.get() finishes before the first one, sets the content, and then the previous one finishes and then sets the content.  How do you handle this situation
[05:37:52] <taplar> prevent the second get from happening
[05:38:04] <taplar> or cancel the first
[05:38:10] <pokergod> How do you cancel the first?
[05:38:21] <taplar> let me see...
[05:40:23] <piXonix_> taplar: is this something that the user is allowed to do based on the interaction design of whatever you are building?
[05:40:35] <piXonix_> or is this the result of say crazy clicking
[05:40:46] <Xatenev> Heya
[05:40:48] <taplar> pokergod, not taplar, :P
[05:40:48] <pokergod> This is a result of someone crazily clicking
[05:40:52] <Xatenev> I have an array like ["salutation", "firstname", "lastname", "company", "country", "email", "phone", "address", "zip", "city", "fax", "message"]
[05:40:56] <piXonix_> sorry, @pokergod
[05:41:11] <taplar> and i believe someone said the other day that calling done() on the jqXHR would for it to resolve
[05:41:20] <taplar> *force
[05:41:22] <Xatenev> when I try to add it to an AJAX 'data': its all undefined
[05:41:24] <Xatenev> any idea on that? :/
[05:41:29] <piXonix_> what we will sometimes to do to prevent accidental or 'illegal' activation of multiple events, is to simply set a global var say inMotion to true
[05:41:32] <pokergod> Sometimes the result takes a while to come back, sometimes the second get is quicker.. I wanted to prevent content from being shown when they don't match
[05:41:43] <piXonix_> and then before the next event can fire, we check to make sure that is set to false
[05:42:00] <piXonix_> that will let people click all day and not do anything until the value lets them
[05:42:59] <piXonix_> if they do indeed need to wait, you should make sure that you are running your function calls asynchronously
[05:43:10] <piXonix_> so that the next one cannot proceed until the previous says it is done
[05:43:39] <taplar> Xatenev: got a fiddle?
[05:43:49] <Xatenev> umm no
[05:44:03] <Xatenev> its just like var array = ["salutation", "firstname", "lastname"];
[05:44:05] <Xatenev> and i add it to data:
[05:44:07] <Xatenev> from $.ajax^^
[05:44:52] <taplar> if the variable is coming back undefined, then it could be a scope issue
[05:44:59] <taplar> thus to see more -> fiddle
[05:45:00] <taplar> :)
[05:46:20] <Xatenev> taplar: theres nothing more tho
[05:46:20] <Xatenev> xD
[05:46:47] <taplar> so everything is perfect...... but it doesn't work? ;)
[05:46:53] <taplar> i can't guess what your code is doing
[05:47:35] <Xatenev> Yea somebody in another channel answered me alrdy now :]
[05:47:47] <Xatenev> Its no key value array
[05:47:49] <Xatenev> thats why ...
[05:48:13] <taplar> huh?
[05:48:15] <Xatenev> theres nothign to guess if I wrote all code I have :)
[05:51:03] <taplar> i get that it was not key value pairs but "when I try to add it to an AJAX 'data': its all undefined" makes it sound like you were trying to set the data element but the variable was undefined
[05:52:01] <Xatenev> Well in the request its undefined
[05:52:06] <Xatenev> undefined=&undefined=&undefined=
[05:52:14] <taplar> that's different, :)
[06:02:33] <Xatenev> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8890524/pass-array-to-ajax-request-in-ajax is this accepted answer just plain wrong?
[06:02:37] <Xatenev> Or am I using it incorrectly? o>o
[06:03:59] <taplar> in your case are you doing dataType: json?
[06:04:52] <Xatenev> nope
[06:05:02] <Xatenev> Im doing exactly the same as the accepted answer
[06:05:14] <Xatenev> Just with other values instead of hi or hello
[06:07:52] <pokergod> how do I pass in a var when doing $.ajax(), I want to track which success() i'm in
[06:08:35] <notchris> I have dates in the following format: Fri 7/17/15
[06:08:46] <notchris> I want to make the day of the week the full name
[06:08:54] <notchris> Any suggestions how to do this?
[06:08:58] <taplar> pokergod: you don't have to pass them in.  the success callback can access other variables in scope
[06:09:05] <notchris> Note: The dates are strings to start
[06:10:51] <taplar> notchris: look into seeting a Date() object with your value then it should have a formatter option for converting it to a string.  or in you case you could probably just set the day and get the format of that if that is all your concerned with converting
[06:11:20] <piXonix_> notchris: try date.parse()
[06:11:35] <piXonix_> that should take a string and get you a date object, then you can use the js date funcitons on it
[06:12:54] <notchris> hhmmm
[06:13:14] <taplar> Xatenev: http://jsfiddle.net/39814ymm/ seems fine on the request
[06:36:57] <Kamuela> is there some kind of ballpark figure of at which point you start to see performance returns with jquery over "native" js+dom? like a point where serving up the jquery files and calling the functions externally actually benefits a heavier UI
[06:43:28] <taplar> the benifits are in potentially more compact code and jquery's handling of the different browsers
[06:45:04] <piXonix_> it can also help reduce development time
[06:45:12] <taplar> like any framework, you have to weigh how much space it takes vs what it does for you, how much it keeps you from reinventing the wheel
[06:45:23] <piXonix_> exactly
[06:47:28] <Xatenev> how can I check with jquery whether all input fields with required="required" are filled?
[06:47:33] <Xatenev> (in the best way?)
[06:47:48] <taplar> do a filter and find those who's value is not set
[07:10:42] <hectortrope> Hi guys what is javascript channel I am unable to login
[07:12:57] <piXonix_> hectortrope: type /list
[07:13:02] <piXonix_> let it load for bit
[07:13:05] <piXonix_> search for javascript
[07:13:13] <piXonix_> I found one at ##javascript
[07:19:55] <hectortrope> java script is like damn I am unable to go there
[07:20:11] <taplar> huh?
[07:21:01] <prohobo> not verified
[07:21:25] <taplar> well what's your question?  we might can help
[07:21:26] <hectortrope> verified
[07:55:59] <placidb> hi. I need to execute some code when the window has finished loading. do I need both the 'DOMContentLoaded' and 'load' events, or would either one suffice?
[07:56:44] <placidb> currently my code executes twice, once for each event, which doesn't seem necessary in this particular case.
[07:57:08] <taplar> should be able to use document.ready to delay execution until page is loaded
[07:57:54] <piXonix_> so when the page is ready or when everything on the page has finished loading to the screen?
[07:58:10] <placidb> wouldn't 'ready' trigger before elements are loaded? I have a one page layout and I need to determine the individual content item boundaries using getBoundingClientRect().
[07:58:20] <taplar> ah
[07:58:30] <placidb> I think 'ready' would fire before images and such are loaded? therefore throwing off the top/bottom dimensions?
[07:59:08] <taplar> no, ready waits for images
[07:59:12] <taplar> according to https://learn.jquery.com/using-jquery-core/document-ready/
[07:59:29] <placidb> to be precise, I want the currently visible content item to light up in my sticky (position: fixed) menu.
[07:59:36] <nothingsofaqr> i am trying to send the request to web service for basic auth and it is giving me access denied error.When I send req using postman plugin for chrome it gives me the result.Here is my request https://gist.github.com/anonymous/ff77bc5e9377a749e848
[07:59:38] <piXonix_> ready is as soon as the page is delivered, not all assets laoded I believe
[07:59:44] <piXonix_> load waits for everything
[07:59:51] <piXonix_> https://api.jquery.com/ready/
[08:00:25] <placidb> taplar: I think that page says to use window.load if you want to wait for images to have loaded.
[08:00:49] <taplar> ah, true
[08:01:36] <placidb> just wondering about the difference between 'DOMContentLoaded' and 'load' and whether I would require both
[08:01:49] <placidb> I've seen some examples using both, but I don't want to execute things twice, if I don't have to.
[08:01:56] <piXonix_> on the surface, they look top be the same thing
[08:02:03] <piXonix_> *to be
[08:02:36] <placidb> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2414750/difference-between-domcontentloaded-and-load-events
[08:02:44] <nothingsofaqr> anybody ?
[08:02:45] <placidb> seems like DOMContentLoaded behaves similar to 'ready'
[08:04:21] <taplar> nothingsofaqr: that exact request works else where?  just curious cause other than the header I don't see you providing any data: for the post
[08:05:06] <nothingsofaqr> taplar: not the exact one, but the one done via postman plugin in chrome
[08:08:16] <taplar> nothingsofaqr: so all your request needs is the header, is this correct?
[08:08:32] <nothingsofaqr> yeah
[08:08:46] <taplar> for shiggles, try taking off the dataType
[08:09:25] <nothingsofaqr> header with additional authorization header with basic and encoded username password
[08:10:39] <nothingsofaqr> taplar: removed, still not working
[08:11:21] <taplar> foo
[08:12:39] <taplar> and your access denied is coming from the error function for xhr.responseText yes?
[08:13:20] <nothingsofaqr> what
[08:13:33] <nothingsofaqr> xhr.responsetext ?
[08:14:15] <taplar> line 22
[08:14:25] <taplar> i also found this http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5507234/how-to-use-basic-auth-and-jquery-and-ajax
[08:16:11] <nothingsofaqr> taplar: sorry on line 16 there should be alert(response);
[08:16:18] <nothingsofaqr> that is what showing error I guess
[08:16:23] <nothingsofaqr> the response is 200OK
[08:16:39] <nothingsofaqr> but fucking access denied is showing up
[08:17:09] <taplar> ah, so your request works, but the back end is not validating
[08:17:24] <taplar> so to me that would seem it's not liking how your constructing/sending theheader
[08:17:54] <nothingsofaqr> taplar: you were right. it was line 22
[08:18:09] <nothingsofaqr> although browser shows it was 200 OK
[08:18:15] <nothingsofaqr> it is response text
[08:18:27] <nothingsofaqr> because alert is not popping up
[08:18:32] <taplar> look in your console in the network tab and see what the return code is
[08:18:48] <nothingsofaqr> return code 200OK
[08:19:00] <taplar> if it goes into the error it should not be a 200
[08:19:11] <taplar> 200 is a success code
[08:19:12] <nothingsofaqr> Request Method:POST
[08:19:12] <nothingsofaqr> Status Code:200 OK
[08:19:21] <nothingsofaqr> awww
[08:20:26] <nothingsofaqr> apparently it is 200 OK but failure call
[08:20:31] <nothingsofaqr> how is that possible >.<
[08:20:45] <nothingsofaqr> it is not going inside success block
[08:20:48] <shoky> nothingsofaqr: could be because the response is not json but you have dataTYpe:'json'
[08:21:07] <shoky> log the error argument in the error callback
[08:23:25] <nothingsofaqr> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/14fcbe961e2cd51491dc
[08:23:40] <nothingsofaqr> shoky: here is the error
[08:23:45] <nothingsofaqr> that we have logged
[08:24:37] <shoky> nothingsofaqr: yes, that is html, not json. that's one reason for it to go to the failure callback instead of the success
[08:25:18] <shoky> nothingsofaqr: show your actual code that's building the auth header
[08:27:01] <nothingsofaqr> I have already pasted that ajax call for auth
[08:27:18] <nothingsofaqr> I don't have access to source code of that web service
[08:27:43] <taplar> the javascript construction of the parameters for the ajax request and the actual ajax request
[08:27:49] <shoky> so you're actualy sending AAAA== ?  and that's supposed to work?
[08:28:25] <shoky> also, don't use alerts. use console.log
[08:28:41] <nothingsofaqr> yeah, that is working
[08:29:03] <nothingsofaqr> I have removed datatype = 'json'
[08:29:05] <nothingsofaqr> damn!
[08:29:55] <taplar> ?
[08:35:13] <shoky> oh well
[08:35:49] <taplar> shoky do you know, validations like that do they required the header part to be a base64 hash?
[08:36:28] <shoky> that's what i've usually seen, i haven't done it myself really
[08:36:48] <shoky> haven't used http auth, that is
[08:37:11] <taplar> that's what i'm seeing in this example i found.  i tried to decode AAAA== and i'm not sure that'a a valid hash.  i get junk
[08:38:46] <shoky> yah no idea
[08:49:12] <Cyclohexane> How do I pass a variable into an on click event? I seem to be having a weird issue where the wrong variable instance is being used inside the event... http://pastebin.com/0AuAph5K
[08:49:43] <robertmaxrees> you don't.
[08:49:51] <robertmaxrees> oh you mean using data.
[08:51:02] <Cyclohexane> robertmaxrees: any idea why that would be using the old event? is it because the function tries to create the click event multiple times?
[08:51:26] <Cyclohexane> if you try to register a click event twice i'm guessing it ignores the newer one?
[08:51:34] <taplar> nope, double binds
[08:51:34] <robertmaxrees> it ignores the old one actually.
[08:51:38] <taplar> oh really?
[08:51:41] <robertmaxrees> err, you're right.
[08:51:43] <robertmaxrees> does both.
[08:52:11] <Cyclohexane> double binds? so both events trigger?
[08:52:14] <taplar> yep
[08:52:17] <taplar> err
[08:52:18] <robertmaxrees> both handlers, yeah.
[08:52:21] <robertmaxrees> one event, two handlers.
[08:52:31] <taplar> the event propogates from newest through oldest
[08:52:37] <Cyclohexane> this might be why its using the old variable then
[08:52:55] <robertmaxrees> it's doing both.
[08:53:13] <Cyclohexane> it's not because i probably have a stopPropagation or something somewhere
[08:53:35] <taplar> no, only bind your delegate once
[08:53:44] <robertmaxrees> ^
[08:53:48] <robertmaxrees> that's part of the p[oint.
[08:56:00] <taplar> question, what is 'departmentTable'?  is it not #departmenttable
[08:57:28] <robertmaxrees> the variable assignment happens a line before :)
[08:58:11] <taplar> he's passing that variable in.  by it's name it seems like it would be the id element
[08:58:14] <taplar> seems strange
[08:58:20] <Cyclohexane> taplar: departmentTable references a datatables instance that gets created on the fly
[08:58:27] <taplar> aaaaah
[08:59:11] <taplar> of which there can be multiple?
[08:59:42] <robertmaxrees> wait Cyclohexane you don't have multiple items with that same ID, right?
[09:01:32] <Cyclohexane> taplar: ah no, there should only ever be 1 so i'm going about it wrong by recreating it every time, just clear/re-add the data every time it needs to change
[09:02:39] <taplar> ah, well good
[09:03:05] <taplar> i was actually going to suggest possibly storing the reference on one of the objects as a prop, so you could reference that instead of passing it
[09:20:28] <notchris> Is it better to create a <select> and append options to it
[09:20:38] <notchris> Or create an each function of options and then wrap it with a select
[09:21:11] <robertmaxrees> create the select first but don't append to the document - append options to that and then append the whole mess to the DOM.
[09:28:01] <notchris> robertmaxrees: TY
[09:28:55] <Exuma> hi - if im .hide() and .show() on several elements on the page, and it changes the document height, how can i make sure the page doesnt scroll? I've tried to use $(document).scrollTop() and the value doesnt change for some reason, even though the document height changes...
[09:29:12] <Exuma> I was going to take that value and the scroll to the original value
[09:29:17] <Exuma> but considering theyre the same value that defeats that plan
[09:31:52] <taplar> interesting
[09:32:16] <taplar> so page height is X, you've scrolled to Y, you hide an item and you want to stay on Y relatively?
[09:32:28] <robertmaxrees> that's really jarring ux imo.
[09:32:36] <Exuma> well, what it is is a bunch of code snippets for JSON/XML/ETC
[09:32:42] <Exuma> so theres 10 of them going odwn the page
[09:32:44] <robertmaxrees> not sure what you mean?
[09:32:49] <Exuma> there are inline buttons to switch from JSON to XML
[09:32:54] <Exuma> but all the code snippets are different heights
[09:33:02] <Exuma> so if you switch to XML the whole document will scroll the difference in heights
[09:33:46] <Exuma> I was trying to use $(document).scrollTop(), get the original value, then once its done hiding/showing i could scroll back the original value without any animation speed (instant)
[09:33:59] <Exuma> however... before/after hiding and showing, the scrollTop position is the same value
[09:34:06] <Exuma> even though i can see the scroll bar is actually in a different location
[09:34:12] <robertmaxrees> sure - 2 ways to solve that problem.  either don't worry about it since that's the normal thing to do, or make each section the same height and use overflow: scroll;
[09:34:38] <taplar> seems like you'd have to determine how much y axis is being changed, and adjust your y the inverse amount, maybe
[09:34:48] <Exuma> i was thinking of taking the difference in document height
[09:34:56] <Exuma> i thought there must be a better way though
[09:35:04] <robertmaxrees> i feel like this is a non-issue.
[09:35:15] <taplar> but what would make that tricky is if your hiding things above or below you.  mute point for below
[09:37:23] <Exuma> robertmaxrees i dont think its a non-issue, from a UX perspective its very nice not to change code samples and lose your place reading
[09:37:34] <Exuma> this is a huge page of API docs so it starts to all look the same after awhile
[09:38:00] <robertmaxrees> imo, put the button next to the heading for each section and change just that section.
[09:38:17] <robertmaxrees> i can't see people switching formats in the middle of reading through a data example.
[09:38:35] <Exuma> yes, thats true
[09:39:21] <taplar> or display the related snipplets in a block with each type being it's own tab
[09:40:06] <taplar> like http://jqueryui.com/tabs/
[09:41:25] <taplar> or is that what you were eluding to rob?
[09:41:32] <robertmaxrees> same basic concept.
[09:44:12] <robertmaxrees> *alluding, fwiw :D
[09:44:15] <notchris> How do I append multiple variables to something
[09:44:24] <robertmaxrees> wut
[09:44:33] <notchris> instead of… a.appendTo(‘example’);
[09:44:41] <notchris> b.appendTo(‘example’)
[09:44:42] <notchris> ect..
[09:45:05] <robertmaxrees> $('example').append(a, b) <- http://api.jquery.com/append/
[09:45:13] <notchris> Damn I’m a moron
[09:45:16] <notchris> Thanks robertmaxrees
[09:51:21] <blakespot> So, I've inherited this jquery script - short pastebin: http://pastebin.com/88K0AMb9
[09:51:31] <taplar> i prefer money myself
[09:51:42] <blakespot> note the 'click' on line 8. I need this also to work on tablets, so need a touch event.
[09:52:01] <blakespot> how can I modify that structure to handle touch also?
[09:52:19] <taplar> is touch the actual event?  maybe 'click, touch'
[09:52:21] <robertmaxrees> blakespot that's a question for usmap.
[09:52:22] <blakespot> 'click', 'touch' : function(event,data)...    ?
[09:53:17] <blakespot> well, it seems its a basic modification, but things I've tried aren't working
[09:53:22] <robertmaxrees> right.
[09:53:28] <robertmaxrees> because the plugin dictates that, not jquery'
[09:53:31] <blakespot> not hugely proprietary code structure it seems
[09:54:13] <robertmaxrees> newsignature.github.io/us-map/#usage-events
[09:54:17] <robertmaxrees> you only have click as an option.
[09:55:01] <taplar> btw, off topic, but lin 11 to 13, i believe you can just the css call straight off the selector and it will do it for all elements
[09:55:06] <blakespot> nice find
[09:55:07] <blakespot> I see
[09:57:27] <taplar> hey rob, could he bind on touch and simply have that pass in the event to the click, or just trigger click?
[09:57:35] <robertmaxrees> *robert btw :)
[09:57:41] <taplar> :D
[09:57:42] <robertmaxrees> and this has nothing to do with jquery.
[09:57:47] <robertmaxrees> it's the plugin.
[09:59:43] <taplar> o.O
[09:59:51] <robertmaxrees> spambot.
[09:59:55] <taplar> ah
[10:00:31] <rcyr> Seriously.. at night, this channel gets "raped" (For the lack of a better word) by spammers..
[10:00:43] <taplar> yeah i saw it in the logs this morning
[10:00:50] <rcyr> And since there's no OP... it keeps going on.... and on..
[10:00:57] <taplar> and a better word is 'flooded', :P
[10:04:03] <notchris> If I append a button with an ID to a page
[10:04:14] <notchris> Why does my on click function for that button not work?
[10:04:46] <taplar> is the handler bound as a delegate or are you directly binding to the button?
[10:06:29] <notchris> http://jsfiddle.net/notchris/tkkyoq02/
[10:06:32] <notchris> It works in the fiddle
[10:06:35] <notchris> But not in my document
[10:06:36] <notchris> weird
[10:07:05] <taplar> your id is unique to the page, yes?
[10:07:10] <notchris> Yes
[10:07:28] <taplar> i'm out of ideas
[10:07:30] <taplar> lol
[10:07:32] <taplar> next!
[10:07:37] <robertmaxrees> do it with a delegated listener
[10:07:45] <robertmaxrees> juuust in case.
[10:07:47] <notchris> Hmm
[10:08:17] <taplar> bruncol: if you have a question please ask the room instead of private message.  thx
[10:08:40] <notchris> robertmaxrees: http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[10:08:41] <notchris> ?
[10:08:44] <robertmaxrees> .on()
[10:08:51] <notchris> Hmm I did it with on before
[10:08:53] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events
[10:08:54] <notchris> Still didn’t work
[10:08:57] <robertmaxrees> different syntax of on
[10:09:05] <robertmaxrees> also: http://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/
[10:09:07] <taplar> also no habla espanol
[10:10:28] <taplar> yes!!!! oh good lord.  finally found one of my issues that a try catch was obscuring
[10:10:33] <notchris> http://jsfiddle.net/notchris/tkkyoq02/1/
[10:10:38] <notchris> So that works too, just not on my page
[10:10:51] <robertmaxrees> that's not using delegation.
[10:10:54] <robertmaxrees> read the links i gave you.
[10:12:58] <robertmaxrees> long story short, you need $('someParentElementThatExistsOnPageload').on('click', '#ticket', function() {});
[10:13:31] <notchris> ahhhh
[10:13:47] <notchris> robertmaxrees: This makes sense, thank you
[10:14:00] <notchris> Also, bruncol is spamming me via PM
[10:14:21] <robertmaxrees> "solo gratis" stuff?
[10:14:25] <taplar> ah, so that's what that was
[10:14:26] <notchris> With links, ect
[10:58:43] <Exuma> robertmaxrees, taplar I solved it by taking the offset().top of the currently clicked item and scrolling by that amount
[10:58:44] <Exuma> works perfect
[10:58:59] <robertmaxrees> i still don't like the idea - i hate hijacking user's scroll, but meh.
[11:00:57] <notchris> For some reason $(‘#example option:selected').val()
[11:01:09] <notchris> Is only showing the original selected items value
[11:01:11] <robertmaxrees> you just want the value of the option.
[11:01:15] <robertmaxrees> *the select, sorry
[11:02:25] <notchris> robertmaxrees: what if an option has data-price
[11:02:32] <robertmaxrees> what about it?
[11:02:34] <notchris> $('#age option:selected').data('price');
[11:02:41] <notchris> ?
[11:03:02] <robertmaxrees> sure.
[11:03:09] <robertmaxrees> though why isn't that info in the value?
[11:03:38] <notchris> Because I already have a value for that option
[11:03:41] <notchris> But I need two for that option
[11:03:50] <robertmaxrees> sounds wonky.
[11:05:02] <robertmaxrees> i'd store your data elsehwere and have the value be a key to said data.
[11:06:30] <notchris> Hmm
[11:07:28] <neanderslob> Hi guys, I'm attempting to configure two models so that if a boolean value in the parent is "false", it automatically destroys any cocoon-generated fields in the child model.
[11:07:54] <robertmaxrees> neanderslob are you working with backbone?
[11:07:59] <neanderslob> I'm sure I've seen something like this before but I can't remember how
[11:08:31] <robertmaxrees> neanderslob what MVC are you working with?
[11:08:35] <neanderslob> robertmaxrees: man, I need to check the channel before I start typing
[11:08:44] <robertmaxrees> :) that's where i was headed with that.
[11:09:00] <neanderslob> robertmaxrees: I've done that like twice this week :-P
[11:17:37] <notchris> I really dont get it
[11:17:46] <notchris> Change my select is not updating the value
[11:17:55] <notchris> When I select a different option with a different value
[11:18:09] <notchris> $(‘select option:selected').val();
[11:18:11] <notchris> Does not change...
[11:18:19] <notchris> Even though the option clearly shows a different value
[11:18:31] * robertmaxrees looks into his crystal ball
[11:18:35] <robertmaxrees> weird, i can't see anything ;)
[11:18:42] <notchris> Haha darn it
[11:18:50] <notchris> I’m trying really hard to understand why
[11:20:26] <notchris> In fact, this works: http://jsfiddle.net/notchris/1z8kx7ak/
[11:20:30] <notchris> But it wont work for me on my site
[11:21:02] <robertmaxrees> open your debugger.
[11:21:09] <notchris> No errors
[11:21:13] <robertmaxrees> not the console.
[11:21:16] <robertmaxrees> the debugger :)
[11:21:24] <robertmaxrees> learn to use your step debugger.  it's great for cases like this.
[11:22:07] <notchris> Not sure how to open debugger in chrome hmm

[12:43:42] <earational> hey
[12:44:40] <arthurvr> hey earational
[12:44:54] <earational> what's up @arthurvr ?
[12:45:10] <arthurvr> Nothing really :p
[13:51:31] <hydraidm801> how can I split this line so each #hashtag gets it's own <a href>??  <a href="" class="hashtags">#maud, #biglebowski</a>
[14:06:25] <hydraidm801> how do I add to an object inside $.each() ?
[14:08:45] <markholmes> what do you want to add
[14:09:32] <markholmes> hydraidm801?
[14:09:35] <hydraidm801> values from each
[14:09:50] <markholmes> do you have an example
[14:11:35] <hydraidm801> markholmes: https://jsfiddle.net/motkm3kx/
[14:30:01] <hydraidm801> I'm getting an error that .add() is not a function
[14:30:02] <hydraidm801> https://jsfiddle.net/motkm3kx/2/
[14:37:52] <hydraidm801> is anyone here?
[14:38:16] <hydraidm801> if I have $.Links = {};
[14:38:32] <hydraidm801> and then I try to use .add() it throws an error
[14:38:44] <hydraidm801> $.Links.add();
[14:39:16] <hydraidm801> I realize an empty object would have no methods but I thought using $. would give it all the jquery methods
[14:40:59] <markholmes> sorry i haven't looked yet but make sure that you have jquery selected on the left side
[14:41:17] <markholmes> jsfiddle doesn't load jquery by default
[14:42:19] <markholmes> also you probably will want to use .append() rather than .add()
[14:42:54] <markholmes> unless you don't want to add it to the dom
[14:43:35] <markholmes> are you trying to separate those tags and then link them individually?
[14:46:48] <Uhkis> hydraidm801:
[14:46:56] <Uhkis> hydraidm801: https://jsfiddle.net/motkm3kx/3/
[14:58:10] <hydraidm801> Uhkis: what does the .join() do?
[15:02:16] <graphettion> hydraidm801: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/join
[15:02:49] <graphettion> Returns the array with the option of separating it.
[15:03:50] <hydraidm801> ah so they aren't right up next to each other
[15:04:00] <graphettion> Right.
[15:04:11] <graphettion> But you can add anything to separate them.
[15:06:01] <hydraidm801> so .join() is essentially the opposite of .split()
[15:08:43] <gambl0re> .join() joins all the data in the array
[15:12:38] <graphettion> ,split() splits the array up (for whatever you put in the separator as a parameter)
[15:16:36] <graphettion> .split()
[15:20:26] <tds5016> hi all. I was wondering if it's possible to modify the return from the $.ajax promise object.
[15:21:09] <tds5016> sooo ... I'd like to have $.ajax() resolve with the response from the server and another value of my choosing.
[15:24:55] <shoky> tds5016: $.ajax returns a promise so you can create a new promise from it with whatever value you want e.g.  var request = $.ajax().then(function(data) { return {data: data, anotherValue: somevalue });  ....   request.done(function(mydata) { ... mydata.data, mydata.somevalue })
[15:25:34] <tds5016> I want to just add to the original promises value though. does that make sense?
[15:25:36] <hydraidm801> how do I select <meta name="keywords" content=""> in jQuery ?
[15:25:36] <shoky> er should be mydata.anotherValue
[15:26:01] <shoky> tds5016 you can't modify a promise, once it's resolved that value sticks
[15:26:11] <shoky> but it's so easy to make a new promise out of it with .then
[15:26:14] <shoky> that's what it's there for
[15:28:27] <shoky> tds5016 if you wanted to actually modify the data object itself you can still do  .then(function(data) { data.whatever = ...; return data; })
[15:30:03] <tds5016> soo... what I ended up doing was creating a promise within a promise. lol.
[15:30:18] <tds5016> which is both beautiful and the ugliest thing I've ever done. lol. God help whoever needs to look at this again :-P;
[15:30:25] <shoky> a lot of times that makes sense, not sure if that's what you wanted though
[15:30:40] <tds5016> it is; it's the correct solution for this I'm 99% sure.
[15:30:54] <tds5016> it's still just uglier than sin :-P
[15:31:10] <shoky> can take a look at it if you want
[15:32:44] <hydraidm801> $('[name="keywords"]').attr('content').append('something');
[15:32:45] <hydraidm801> Uncaught TypeError: $(...).attr(...).append is not a function
[15:32:55] <hydraidm801> $('[name="keywords"]').attr('content').add('something')
[15:33:01] <hydraidm801> Uncaught TypeError: $(...).attr(...).add is not a function
[15:33:07] <hydraidm801> WTF?
[15:33:38] <shoky> hydraidm801: .attr gives you the attribute value, a string.  and strings don't have .append or .add methods
[15:34:06] <hydraidm801> so how do I add to the content?
[15:34:34] <shoky> if you want to append to it you can do:  .attr('content', function(i, oldvalue) { return oldvalue + 'something' })
[15:35:34] <hydraidm801> does every jQuery method take an optional function callback?
[15:35:43] <hydraidm801> I know some require a callback
[15:35:53] <shoky> setter functions like .attr usually do
[15:37:26] <shoky> that is, when used as a setter
[15:46:50] <hydraidm801> how can I remove the '#'s from ["#maud", "#biglebowski"] ?
[15:48:44] <mdev> remove how, from the string
[15:48:52] <mdev> ?
[17:56:25] <Kamuela> what's a good way to bring a section into view?
[18:07:09] <BillCriswell> Kamuela: Do you need it to be fancy?
[18:07:25] <BillCriswell> You can just do `el.scrollIntoView()`
[18:07:39] <Kamuela> if you do a .delay can you chain it?
[18:07:49] <Kamuela> wait no, not a delay it'd be an animation wouldn't it
[18:11:13] <BillCriswell> Kamuela: What's your goal?
[18:11:28] <Kamuela> BillCriswell, prettifying routes on a single page
[18:11:48] <Kamuela> so I'm looking at page.js and thinking of writing a scrolling callback for the routes
[18:13:42] <BillCriswell> So change the route then animate to a part of the page?
[18:17:24] <Kamuela> BillCriswell, what do you mean exactly?
[18:17:55] <Kamuela> meaning setup a listen event for that id and then rewrite the route in the URL?
[18:18:06] <Kamuela> but then how does that catch directly something like site.com/pretty-route
[18:20:01] <BillCriswell> you'd need to map the paths to certain elements
[18:23:02] <Kamuela> BillCriswell, is that straightforward or is that precisely why I'm trying to use page.js?
[18:24:26] <BillCriswell> Do you need the urls like `/pretty-route` or would `#pretty-route` be enough? Just `/pretty-route` would require some server side setup.
[18:25:26] <Kamuela> BillCriswell, i'm definitely trying to figure out /pretty-route. right now i'm using ID links that are going site.com/#route1 site.com/#route2, and I find that lacking
[18:26:45] <Whirled> Anyanybody have any personal suggestions for a js/jq animation library that uses css with fallback to js/jq? Too many results to figure out which is best.
[18:31:40] <BillCriswell> Kamuela: I imagine the callback would pass the path so you might be able to do something like: var id = '#' + path.slice(1); (assuming `path` is `/foo`.
[18:32:56] <BillCriswell> Whirled: I'ce heard good things about http://ricostacruz.com/jquery.transit/
[18:33:39] <Kamuela> BillCriswell, I'm trying to exactly understand what you mean there, what's passing a callback?
[18:37:10] <BillCriswell> page('/user/:id', function (ctx, next) { }); <-- the function in there is the callback...
[18:37:59] <Kamuela> ah ok, i was lost because i didn't know we dropped back to page.js
[18:38:41] <BillCriswell> I'm thinking it would be something like this: page('/:page', function (ctx) { var id = '#' + ctx.params.page; /* Something with the id... */ });
[18:39:34] <BillCriswell> but your server would need to know that /foo, /bar, /whatever actually wants /
[18:41:44] <Kamuela> BillCriswell, I've tried to use this https://gist.github.com/KamuelaFranco/e23cc10336663c9c2271 to no avail
[18:42:15] <Kamuela> oh sorry about the wait for it part, that was me trying to play with why it wasn't working, but the straightforward without while loop is what it is
[18:43:39] <BillCriswell> so you're good?
[18:45:49] <Kamuela> nah it didn't work whatsoever. and i was trying to understand why. express.js catches the route and passes it to the template, and i have tested that it in fact does pass it correctly. but the jump function does not behave as expected
[18:46:20] <Kamuela> sectionId does grab the route correctly though
[18:46:49] <BillCriswell> This is front end code, right?
[18:48:06] <Kamuela> yes
[18:48:25] <Kamuela> front end code in a template. and i have tested that the template side of it does pass the correct route from express.js
[18:48:29] <Kamuela> Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'scrollIntoView' of null
[18:48:46] <BillCriswell> Oh duh.
[18:48:55] <BillCriswell> You don't need the '#' +
[18:49:08] <BillCriswell> since you're using getElementById
[18:50:16] <Kamuela> BillCriswell, nice, ok that definitely fixed this a bit
[18:51:35] <Kamuela> hmm... my workaround is definitely inefficient
[18:51:49] <Kamuela> because it reloads the whole page and then scrolls :/
[18:52:33] <BillCriswell> are you using page?
[18:52:40] <Kamuela> page.js? honestly, no
[18:53:39] <Kamuela> i think what i can try to do is directly use my jump function and preventDefault
[18:53:41] <BillCriswell> are you handling the pushState stuff yourself?
[18:53:54] <Kamuela> pushState isn't being handled at all
[18:55:13] <BillCriswell> I don't think you'll be able to go to /some-other-url without using pushState, without experience the refresh.
[18:57:20] <Kamuela> you think i should do a jump + a pushState?
[18:58:45] <Kamuela> i'm thinking an if statement that says if the href path is #, then jump to it and pushstate the prettified
[18:58:46] <BillCriswell> I think you have to.
[18:59:02] <Kamuela> otherwise don't preventDefault
[19:01:41] <BillCriswell> You should download the pagejs repo and mess around with the example.
[19:01:43] <BillCriswell> examples*
[19:02:50] <Kamuela> yes that's what my first inclination was but i truly thought i would have managed to hack this together faster
[19:13:42] <Kamuela> lol ok BillCriswell this is so much more straightforward with page.js
