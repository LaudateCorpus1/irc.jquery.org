[01:40:24] <devi8> is anyone familiar with jquery source? I was wondering why jquery queue source uses queue as the named method as well as a local variable..is there a reason or am I not getting it (bet I am not getting it)
[01:46:57] <Cork> devi8: why does it matter?
[01:47:42] <devi8> just wanted to make sure that I wasn't missing some advantage to using queue as a local variable...like maybe it was not actually local or something...
[01:48:09] <Cork> queue has three existance in jquery
[01:48:42] <Cork> 1. is a scoped shared variable inside jquery, 2. is a $.queue function and 3. is a $().queue() function
[01:50:07] <Cork> but remember variable names only have a meaning for the developer; the parser doesn't care
[01:51:09] <devi8> right. I've been going through wp core and it is so full of global variable names that it is really hard to trust that you understand what's going on.
[01:52:58] <devi8> at the beginning to each piece of jquery, there's a similar "define.... before the etend portion. Can you explain in plain english what is happening there?
[01:53:07] <devi8> If it's too complicated, no worries.
[01:53:39] <Cork> its the scoped shared variables i talked about
[01:53:53] <Cork> from a class oriented language it would be the class private variables
[01:55:26] <Cork> similarly variables attached to $ are similar to class oriented public variables
[01:55:39] <Cork> (and in the source $ and jQuery are the same object)
[01:58:45] <devi8> I was hoping to look at the queue source to find a way to make something similar that didn't dispose of itself and could be reused. I figured this would be a good way to learn more about how jquery works.
[01:59:35] <Cork> devi8: it is basically a one direction node list
[02:00:16] <Cork> it can be written fairly easy
[02:00:49] <devi8> for you, I am certain. I figured I would try it since it seems easy to do.
[02:01:48] <Cork> var queue = {}; queue[queueName] = []; then on queue push it to that array, on dequeue shift it from it
[02:02:08] <Cork> in your case you prob need to store an index you modify instead of shift
[02:02:32] <Cork> so ya, that is why i recommend you start from scratch instead
[02:02:40] <Cork> cause it will be quite fundamentally different
[02:03:18] <devi8> Do you know of any resources I could read about creating this kind of thing? I will gladly read anything you suggest.
[02:03:38] <Cork> no, i doun't, it is a fairly simple thing
[02:06:08] <devi8> Okay. I'm gonna start from scratch to see how far I get. I'll post back here tomorrow if you feel generous and wanted to glance at it.
[02:06:24] <devi8> I appreciate your help, but understand if you don't have time or aren't interested
[02:09:22] <Cork> devi8: something like this https://jsfiddle.net/y35pumwk/
[02:09:41] <Cork> it is not complete in any sense of the word, but it should be quite a bit along
[03:19:00] <devi8> sorry, I'm back. My icemaker sprung a major leak. All fixed
[05:19:50] <xinobi> I'm not sure why enter key is firing a function on click event is that normal?
[05:20:11] <xinobi> $('.action-box').on('click', function (evt) { ... }
[05:20:35] <xinobi> after clicking with mouse if I press enter I get the same action...
[05:21:27] <Cork> yes it is normal
[05:21:36] <Cork> well depending on the element is focusable
[05:21:54] <Cork> so links, buttons and form fields
[05:22:03] <Cork> (and elements with tabindex)
[05:23:20] <xinobi> Cork: so what are my chances here? Should I unbind the event while code is running, disable the element or prevent enter key from firing the event?
[05:23:44] <Cork> xinobi: what are you trying to do?
[05:26:36] <xinobi> this is a modal that waits for user interaction while user doesn't answer if press enter the modal fires again and again etc so you can imagine how modal element get stacked up on each other, I just want to prevent that from happening I thought I could disable the element for a while
[05:27:34] <xinobi> that happens because the element received focus right?
[05:28:43] <Cork> xinobi: give the modal tabindex="0"
[05:28:51] <Cork> and then focus it when you show it
[05:29:16] <Cork> you might also have an event listener for keydown where you stopPropagation()
[05:29:25] <Cork> so events don't bubble
[05:30:12] <xinobi> Cork: I thought if I disabled the element (link) $obj.attr('disabled', true); that it would prevent the enter key from from firing but no It still so it must be related with focus
[05:32:30] <Cork> you can't disable links
[05:32:36] <Cork> only form elements
[05:33:03] <Cork> so input, button, select, textarea
[05:35:24] <thykka> (you can disable links, just not with the disabled attribute)
[05:36:13] <xinobi> Cork: yes of course that is why it is not a proper solution ;) I tried to set 'tabindex' : 0, to modal box close button and it still enter key is able to fire the event...
[05:40:44] <xinobi> this happens to solve the issue $obj.blur();
[05:46:16] <xinobi> I want to give focus to a button, meaning I will need to move focus... how can I do that?
[05:49:59] <Cork> xinobi: yes event are fired, and that is why you need to catch them
[05:50:16] <Cork> firstly does the modal cover the page so other places can't be clicked?
[05:50:32] <Cork> if no, then that is the first thing you need to fix
[05:51:05] <Cork> xinobi: to move focus is just $('selector').focus()
[05:51:53] <xinobi> Cork: the modal covers the all page except for box with ui buttons etc obviously (superior z-index), I need the button "no" to receive focus after firing on click
[05:52:10] <Cork> so just set focus
[05:52:24] <Cork> just remember to handle tab events :)
[05:52:28] <Cork> (focus changes)
[05:53:45] <xinobi> Cork: $('selector').focus() I've done that but it doesn't work do not know why...
[05:53:57] <Cork> you replaced 'selector' right?
[05:54:03] <xinobi> Cork: thank you for the tab tip ;)
[05:54:12] <xinobi> Cork: lol yes
[05:54:19] <Cork> is the button a button?
[05:54:27] <Cork> or is it just a styled span or something like that?
[05:58:34] <xinobi> Cork: line 156 https://jsfiddle.net/#&togetherjs=uhEbaEobaR
[05:58:40] <Cork> hit save
[06:02:31] <xinobi> Cork: are able to see it now?
[06:02:42] <Cork> you need to share a saved link first
[06:08:31] <xinobi> Cork: well I have... jfiddle got upgraded with some nasty improvements I need to learn the basics! I'm sure it wasn't made thinking on monkeys... like me :( https://jsfiddle.net/jquarks/x83s39jd/#&togetherjs=uhEbaEobaR
[06:09:38] <xinobi> Cork: please take a look here https://gist.github.com/obinoob/06a0d079d64d42bc68622194522db8e2#file-actionbox-js-L156
[06:41:25] <xinobi> Cork: here you can see the full example working badly :) https://jsfiddle.net/jquarks/x83s39jd/12/
[07:05:39] <xinobi> I've set 'tabindex': x (where x is an integer), to my modal buttons as property and gave focus to modal content but the tab gets stick to the background modal layer?!?
[07:06:45] <xinobi> anyone?!?
[07:07:06] <Woet> xinobi: what is your jQuery question?
[07:07:52] <xinobi> Woet: it about how to properly address tab behaviour to an element
[07:08:06] <Woet> xinobi: not seeing the relevance to jQuery, sorry.
[07:08:27] <xinobi> Woet: yes I've denoted that within your question
[07:08:54] <xinobi> Woet: which ended up as you planed ahead right?
[07:09:32] <xinobi> thank you for your help

[07:42:01] <Guest92058> Hi, We are  migrating a Struts application from 2.3 to 2.5. It supports Struts-Jquery 4.0.3 version. We have used a tag called <sj:select> with autoCompletion. Data is loading correctly. But while clicking on that textbox its giving following error.  "Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'PAGE_UP' of undefined"
[07:42:09] <Guest92058> Please help me somebody
[07:42:18] <Guest92058> Thanks in advance
[07:43:09] <Cork> Guest92058: it most likely depends on jquery ui
[07:43:26] <Cork> and i THINK jquery ui moved there $.ui.keys (or what is was called)
[07:44:00] <Guest92058> Means, I have to change JQuery UI version also ?
[07:44:51] <Cork> ah right $.ui.keyCode
[07:45:16] <Cork> and 1.12 (latest) still have $.ui.keyCode.PAGE_UP so you most likely isn't loading jquery ui
[07:46:25] <Guest92058> Okay Cork. I will try this. Thanks for the help
[07:48:20] <Guest92058> Cork, If i replace only jquery-ui.css file. Is that fine or can you tell me what latest version files I need place ?
[07:48:41] <Cork> you need the jquery-ui.js
[07:48:48] <Cork> https://code.jquery.com/ui/
[07:49:19] <Cork> the .css files are just the themeing (and the core part to give the dimentions)
[07:50:17] <Cork> you can use the bulder http://jqueryui.com/download/ if you want a none complete lib
[07:50:35] <Guest92058> Okay Okay Thank you
[07:53:54] <Guest92058> Cork, I replaced. But still isue persist
[07:54:07] <Cork> are you including them in the correct order?
[07:54:22] <Guest92058> jquery.ui.core.js - do i need to change this file also ?
[07:54:27] <Cork> first jquery (only once) then jquery-ui (only once)
[07:54:42] <Cork> either you use them separately or use the combinated
[07:54:45] <Cork> never both
[07:55:08] <Cork> jquery-ui.js is a combination of modules
[07:55:17] <AdamPDotty> combined :-)
[07:58:05] <Guest92058> We are not using jqueryUI or JQuery
[07:58:25] <Cork> Guest92058: well the lib your depending on does
[07:58:27] <Guest92058> No where it is imported
[07:58:41] <Cork> well there you have why it errors out
[07:58:56] <Guest92058> No where JQuery UI or JQuery is imported i our Source files
[07:59:14] <Guest92058> Thats why i posted here
[08:02:02] <Guest92058> If i add jQuery UI now, will it resolves ?
[08:02:20] <Cork> you need to first include jquery (as ui depends on it) then jquery ui
[08:02:26] <Cork> then this lib can work
[08:02:37] <Cork> (just make sure to include it after those two libs)
[08:03:05] <Guest92058> Ok
[08:03:39] <Cork> it sounds like this lib uses jquery ui autocomplete as its based feature
[08:03:48] <Cork> *base
[08:26:29] <Guest92058> Hi Cork, i imported jQuery UI js and then its worked for me
[08:28:30] <Guest92058> thanks
[08:28:34] <Cork> np
[08:36:59] <lissitzki> hi folks
[08:37:09] <lissitzki> struggling with this code https://jsfiddle.net/el_lissitzki/e2zvr147/21/
[08:37:27] <lissitzki> to be more like this menu http://www.irb-paris.eu/
[08:38:44] <lissitzki> workplan: 1) add accordeon elements 2) add hiding animation when links are clicked
[08:39:18] <lissitzki> and this is my first jquery code actually
[08:44:02] <Woet> is there a question hidden somewhere?
[08:47:24] <lissitzki> ahah
[08:47:34] <lissitzki> i like to keep you informed
[08:47:56] <lissitzki> well actually i don't know where to start
[08:48:06] <lissitzki> i'm thinking better the accordeon thing
[08:49:18] <thykka> an accordion is usually a container div with overflow: hidden; and a toggle to set it's height to "0" or auto..
[08:49:22] <thykka> if that helps
[08:50:30] <thykka> animooting it is slightly trickier, but the key is to first set it's height to auto, saving it's actual height and setting it to 0 again, then animating from 0 to the saved height, and finally setting it back go "auto" so that reflows won't break it
[08:51:20] <lissitzki> thanks, can you tell me first if the menu in http://www.irb-paris.eu/ has an accordeon? for example if you click atelier
[08:51:43] <thykka> i would not call that an accordion
[08:52:01] <thykka> and i wouldn't willingly implement that on a production website...
[08:52:03] <thykka> terrible UX
[08:52:10] <lissitzki> i know
[08:52:13] <lissitzki> well
[08:54:42] <lissitzki> first i'll try to copy it, that's what it was requested, than making it better...
[08:59:07] <lissitzki> thykka, do you have in mind a better example? something that could be related to that?
[09:04:22] <thykka> well, it seems to me like the designer is trying to reinvent the wheel to create something unique/recognizable, better talk to them
[09:18:20] <anli> How is the jwplayer open source version different than the commercial?
[09:33:25] <lissitzki> thykka, thanks for the suggestion, but I'd prefer to try to reproduce their menu for the moment and learn something in the process.  So if that part is not an accordeon would you still implement it in the way you suggested me?
[09:35:03] <thykka> no
[09:36:29] <thykka> i'd just group the sublink of a link within a common div, then use classes to show/hide the sublinks.
[09:38:42] <lissitzki> ok, i'll try like this
[11:19:05] <s2013> anyone familiar with qtip? how do you get it to do multi line?
[11:19:10] <s2013> i tried adding &#013;
[11:19:10] <s2013> didnt work
[11:22:19] <thykka> no, but did you try a <br>?
[11:26:17] <thykka> s2013, http://jsfiddle.net/jd5nbj5x/811/
[11:26:42] <s2013> i did
[11:26:43] <s2013> &lt;br/&gt;
[11:26:46] <s2013> this ended up working
[11:26:51] <thykka> :V
[11:27:04] <thykka> sounds like an XSS vulnerability
[13:05:14] <mrshark> Does anyone know how to use jquery-ui?
[13:05:26] <mrshark> I'm trying to install a couple widgets for this project and keep getting this error:
[13:05:30] <mrshark> "define is not defined"
[13:05:33] <mrshark> in core.js
[13:05:55] <mrshark> not sure where to ask since the jquery-ui github has disabled any issues from being created and I don't really want to ask stackoverflow
[13:07:38] <mrshark> or if anyone is even here haha
[13:11:40] <LeGorille> hey folks.  $( rowNode ).effect('highlight', {color: 'teal'}, 3000); return a background-color of rgba(0,0,0,0)
[13:13:30] <mrshark> LeGorille: is that a question, or do you just wanna spread some jquery haha
[13:13:32] <tsukasadt> robertmaxrees, I built a time delay into the rendering of the tab generation code for the demo I gave earlier and it was enough to convince my boss to let me do as much of it on the server as possible. So, most of that jQuery I wrote will be thrown away. Yay! :D
[13:13:56] <LeGorille> mrshark, :) it is a question
[13:14:05] <LeGorille> do you have any idea why ?
[13:15:42] <mrshark> LeGorille: I think highlight only takes a hex code
[13:15:48] <mrshark> 'teal' is a css keyword
[13:16:22] <LeGorille> it doesn't work with hex, rgba or with the default #ffa
[13:16:38] <LeGorille> but teal should work as well
[13:16:42] <mrshark> ahh
[13:16:59] <mrshark> no idea, that looks like it should work
[13:17:38] <LeGorille> it works, just not with the proper color :P
[13:18:40] <mrshark> hahah
[13:26:42] <robertmaxrees> tsukasadt hah, niiiiice
[13:26:46] <robertmaxrees> congrats :)
[13:27:09] <robertmaxrees> those big "Delete a buncha stuff" cases are some of my favorites :D
[13:31:02] <tsukasadt> Yeah, I just wanted to let you know that I understood where you were coming from, but I had to do it their way before I could do it mine. I fudged the results a little, but, bleh.
[13:45:44] <reynierpm> hi there, can any give me some advice here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48549179/values-are-set-when-manual-trigger-change-on-select-but-not-when-triggering-from ?? I must be missing something trivial but I don't know what it's
[13:47:08] <robertmaxrees> reynierpm i'm not clear on what the issue is.
[13:48:30] <reynierpm> robertmaxrees, the issue is that the `.trigger()` event seems not to be working when I click on the button
[13:49:25] <robertmaxrees> the event's fine.
[13:49:32] <reynierpm> robertmaxrees, here https://jsfiddle.net/reynierpm/508n2zk6/2/ if you change the default SELECT option to Yes/No and click the button you will see the values being set, reload the page and just click the button you won't see the values
[13:49:33] <robertmaxrees> you mean the handler isn't doing something it should be?
[13:50:42] <reynierpm> robertmaxrees, kind of from what I have I would expect that to be working the same way if I change the SELECT and then click the button and if I just click the button because the button is triggering the change() or at least is what I think
[13:51:01] <robertmaxrees> reynierpm your issue is field_type_id isn't what you think it is.
[13:51:09] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/508n2zk6/3/
[13:51:24] <robertmaxrees> field_type_id is <option value="">Select One</option>
[13:52:59] <robertmaxrees> so fix the defaulting of that dropdown and you'll be g2g
[13:54:09] <reynierpm> robertmaxrees, fixing by setting it to blank or ... ?
[13:54:22] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[13:54:30] <robertmaxrees> read your code
[13:54:37] <robertmaxrees> the change handler has switch (field_type_name) {
[13:54:46] <robertmaxrees> but field_type_name is empty.
[13:59:46] <robertmaxrees> woops
[13:59:58] <reynierpm> robertmaxrees, ok I see what you mean because I want the select to go with the yes/no choice I should set it before and then trigger the change
[14:00:00] <robertmaxrees> reynierpm you see what i said about field_type_name?
[14:00:06] <robertmaxrees> reynierpm bingo.
[14:00:09] <reynierpm> robertmaxrees, yes
[14:00:29] <reynierpm> robertmaxrees, thank you for point me in the right direction
[14:00:42] <robertmaxrees> deffo.  do you see how I figured that out?
[14:01:20] <reynierpm> robertmaxrees, not really :-\ just wondering how do you figured it out
[14:02:19] <robertmaxrees> alright so
[14:02:26] <robertmaxrees> check out your handler.
[14:02:31] <robertmaxrees> field_type.change(function() {
[14:02:40] <robertmaxrees> so the issue was that it "wasn't running", right?
[14:03:12] <reynierpm> robertmaxrees, yes
[14:03:22] <robertmaxrees> okay.  so how do you confirm that statement?
[14:04:58] <reynierpm> robertmaxrees, because the handler depends first on the SELECT choice and then is looking for the data-alias which does not exists for the first and default value, even adding an alias to it will not go through the case I want to the idea is to set the val to 8 and then trigger the change event
[14:05:12] <robertmaxrees> you're jumping ahead.
[14:05:19] <reynierpm> robertmaxrees, ups
[14:05:31] <robertmaxrees> :)
[14:05:49] <robertmaxrees> you said the handler wasn't working - but if you put a console.log() inside, it, you'll see it IS working, right?
[14:06:26] <robertmaxrees> just one step at a time.
[14:06:57] <reynierpm> robertmaxrees, yes the handler was working all the time it just does not work as I expected based on what I was thinking
[14:07:03] <robertmaxrees> right.
[14:07:27] <robertmaxrees> so then, in your handler, you have a switch - one codepath for a var set to 'yes_no" and another that doesn't do anything.
[14:07:28] <robertmaxrees> right?
[14:08:00] <reynierpm> robertmaxrees, right but that's just for example purposes that function has some other cases :)
[14:08:19] <robertmaxrees> jumping ahead again.
[14:08:30] <reynierpm> robertmaxrees, ok one step back I will heard you
[14:08:48] <robertmaxrees> so
[14:08:49] <reynierpm> robertmaxrees, then the answer is yes
[14:09:09] <robertmaxrees> that means that your code isn't hitting that case.  why wouldn't it?
[14:09:31] <reynierpm> robertmaxrees, it shouldn't because I was never sending that value
[14:09:32] <robertmaxrees> put differently, you're expecting that switch statement to do one thing, but it's doing another instead.  what would cause that?
[14:09:36] <robertmaxrees> right.
[14:09:48] <robertmaxrees> that's how you work through that problem.
[14:10:05] <robertmaxrees> in this case, you figure out why you're not hitting a particular codepath
[14:11:06] <robertmaxrees> make sense?
[14:12:34] <reynierpm> robertmaxrees, yes sir
[14:17:53] <reynierpm> robertmaxrees, so that makes me think in this, in order to no repeat the selector I use to define a var and assign the selector to it just like `var dialog_confirm = $("#dialog-confirm");` but in some cases `dialog_confirm` could have something else just like this case, it's a good recommendation repeat the same selector as many times as I need or it's g2g with the var definition? what are your thoughts on this one?
[14:18:19] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[14:18:26] <robertmaxrees> not clear on what you're asking.
[14:19:57] <reynierpm> robertmaxrees, ok, when my IDE (phpStorm) find this $("#selector") more than one it start complaining about jQuery performance, for fix the issue I do `var x = $("#selector")` and use where needed `x` instead of `$("#selector")`
[14:20:02] <reynierpm> are you following til here?
[14:20:12] <robertmaxrees> you mean "
[14:20:26] <robertmaxrees> *"should i run selectors once and store them in variables"?
[14:20:50] <reynierpm> robertmaxrees, yes forgive me about my bad english spanish speaker trying his best
[14:21:03] <robertmaxrees> it's cool, just wasn't clear about the question :)
[14:21:06] <robertmaxrees> and yes, you should do that.
[14:21:15] <robertmaxrees> why re-run selectors?
[14:22:17] <reynierpm> robertmaxrees, as for the IDE I should not since I already go it before and I could re-use it but because of this re-use then I run into the issue as before because the variable has not what I expected
[14:22:26] <reynierpm> robertmaxrees, that's my only concern about that
[14:29:58] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[14:30:00] <robertmaxrees> heh
[14:30:19] <robertmaxrees> i think you're confusing what the IDE is telling you :)
[14:30:38] <robertmaxrees> in your fiddle you do somevar.find('option:selected'), right?
[14:35:59] <robertmaxrees> reynierpm ^
[14:36:25] <reynierpm> robertmaxrees, I am here this wasn't blinking
[14:36:36] <robertmaxrees> see what I asked?
[14:36:39] <reynierpm> robertmaxrees, yes
[14:36:42] <robertmaxrees> right.
[14:36:50] <robertmaxrees> so.  you can store somevar - that doesn't change.
[14:36:58] <robertmaxrees> the thing you're finding does.
[14:37:09] <robertmaxrees> so var someElement = $('#yourId');
[14:37:19] <robertmaxrees> then later it's just someElement.find('option:selected');
[14:37:22] <robertmaxrees> and you're good to go.
[14:37:41] <reynierpm> robertmaxrees, got it nice solution
[14:37:43] <reynierpm> :)
[14:37:57] <reynierpm> robertmaxrees, well more then nice a logic solution
[15:02:49] <reynierpm> what's the difference between `$("#sel").change(function() {}).trigger("change")` and `$("#sel").change(function() {})`? I have notice that the first one is called when the page is loaded and the second one isn't but if I remove the `.trigger()` at the end is not working properly in some other places
[15:03:41] <robertmaxrees> one triggers the handler while the other doesn't./
[15:03:47] <robertmaxrees> .trigger('change') fires the handler.
[15:03:58] <robertmaxrees> if you omit it, the handler is simply bound.
[15:04:35] <reynierpm> robertmaxrees, ok thanks
[15:49:52] <reynierpm> guys what's the proper way to get and element by it's ID when it does not exists which mean it was generated on the fly?
[16:24:35] <lissitzki_> There is this website: http://www.irb-paris.eu, my question is, why the menu seems not loading again when a link has been clicked?
[16:35:44] <mmmveggies> reynierpm: it depends on how you expect that generation to happen
[16:44:45] <gambl0re> hi robert
[16:50:00] <robertmaxrees> reynierpm the same way you get any other element.
[20:41:32] <riskish> hello
[22:43:36] <riskish> https://jsfiddle.net/o8to6yt7/2/ does anyone know how I might label the row (static numbers, 1 to N) such that the labels stay, even when dragging/reordering the names?
