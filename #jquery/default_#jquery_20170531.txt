[09:51:42] <erebel55> is there a way to get click events for a youtube iframe?
[10:01:13] <fas3r> Hello
[10:12:26] <AwkwardCough> erebel55: that would most likely be cors, so most likely no
[11:29:37] <blackbird> Hi
[11:30:04] <taplar> aloha
[11:30:55] <blackbird> I have a problem with getJSON function
[11:32:52] <blackbird> The php code return a JSON: https://pastebin.com/pzqYDYzw
[11:32:58] <Koopz> if $('[data]') doesn't return anything on console i guess i can be sure there's  nothing on the page having data attributes?
[11:34:36] <taplar> Koopz: data elements are data-*
[11:34:52] <taplar> and not all data elements will be attributes.  they can be set logically
[11:35:01] <blackbird> I'm trying to get it with: https://pastebin.com/ccerJfNV
[11:35:35] <taplar> blackbird: what response do you see in your network console?
[11:35:39] <Koopz> taplar, that's why i'm writing $('[data]'); on console to make sure i also check those being set via js
[11:35:43] <blackbird> but data contains: [object Object],[object Object],[object Object],[object Object],[object Object],[object Object],[object Object],[object Object],[object Object],[object Object],[object Object],[object Object],[object Object],[object Object],[object Object]
[11:36:03] <taplar> hmm, i wouldn't have expected that to match anything
[11:36:50] <blackbird> but when I use onlu "$.get", it works !
[11:37:00] <Koopz> i'm supposed to have a table with each row having data-uid but since $('[data-uid]') returns an object with 0 length
[11:37:42] <taplar> blackbird: getJSON will auto parse the json being returned.  so they can log as [object Object]
[11:37:48] <blackbird> The problem that it must be a JSON format, because I wanna parse it after
[11:37:58] <taplar> getJSON auto parses
[11:39:11] <taplar> Koopz: i would expect that to match.  So if that returns 0, then that would mean either the table didn't exist at that point, or the data element was set logically and not in the markup
[11:42:27] <Koopz> i'm writing that into the browser console after the page has finished loading
[11:42:58] <Koopz> the data elements aren't set in the markup
[11:43:00] <blackbird> taplar, thanks man
[11:43:05] <Koopz> the table is getting filled via ajax
[11:43:23] <taplar> but are the data-uid on the html being returned in the ajax response?
[11:43:25] <blackbird> I was confused, I didn't know that.
[11:43:37] <Koopz> the ajax request doesn't return HTML
[11:43:53] <Koopz> it's JSON and DataTables is supposed to handle that
[11:44:06] <taplar> ok, so how are you putting the data-uid on the table?
[11:44:25] <Koopz> DataTables does that
[11:44:43] <taplar> so if you inspect the table, is the data-uid on the table?
[11:45:08] <Koopz> if data elements are set via javascript, there won't be anything in the inspector
[11:45:21] <taplar> then you can't use an attribute selector for that
[11:46:02] <Koopz> but .data('uid') would?
[11:46:09] <taplar> yep
[11:46:17] <taplar> possibly
[11:46:25] <taplar> it depends on how datatables stores that information
[11:46:36] <Koopz> i'll try $('#items tr').data('uid');
[11:47:02] <Koopz> undefined...
[11:48:03] <taplar> so it's possible datatables is not storing the data elements in the same place that jquery does
[11:48:29] <Koopz> $('#items tr') would give me an objectz with the 2 TRs in it... should the sub objects contain the data?
[11:48:43] <taplar> read what i just said
[11:48:44] <Koopz> i can inspect the object, lot's of stuff in there..
[11:48:59] <Koopz> that'd be rather odd
[11:49:07] <taplar> *shrugs* datatables is a pita
[11:49:31] <Koopz> got any better alternative for tables with remote data?
[11:49:35] <MikeD_> i don't even use datatables, but I second that opinion
[11:50:00] <taplar> not really.  for being a pita, they are so because they do so much for you
[11:50:08] <taplar> so it's hard to find an alternative, currently
[11:51:02] <taplar> we hate them, but we use them.  so that says something, :|
[11:52:06] <taplar> i vaguely remember there possibly being a datatables method for getting data fields.  but i'd have to dig in the docs to try to find it
[11:52:30] <Koopz> ugh... i'm pretty sure this worked before...
[11:53:01] <MikeD_> Koopz: what are you trying to accomplish?
[11:53:46] <Koopz> accessing a data-element that's supposedly set on a row
[11:55:53] <Koopz> i'm using serverside processing and the json response with the data has DT_RowData for each element
[11:56:26] <Koopz> DT_RowData being an object with uid: 3
[11:57:04] <Koopz> i could've sworn that this used to set the data element of the tr in another project
[11:57:50] <Koopz> so the tr ended up having a data-uid="3" (obviously not seeable in the browser inspector)
[12:40:03] <momomo> is there an <tag ontouchend="js" like attribute that works like <tag onclick ?
[12:40:38] <momomo> I don't want to bind the element later on, i want to add inline as an attribute
[12:40:44] <robertmaxrees> why?
[12:40:51] <robertmaxrees> why not use a delegated handler?
[12:41:21] <momomo> robertmaxrees: elaborate please?
[12:42:09] <robertmaxrees> is your only reason for not binding with .on() is tha3t you're dynamically creating the element?
[12:44:43] <robertmaxrees> 'cause if so, you can just use a delegated handler for your event listener instead of directly binding to the element.
[12:45:02] <momomo> no, it's generated by other means and i had onclick to fire something, rather than walking over the list all over again to bind them on('click') and it's also a library like functionality so allowing binding afterwards at the same time as generating the html is pretty difficult ... so onclick is perfect there and the js will surely be evaluated first onclick so i dont see the problem with it... for my current situation it works great ...
[12:45:02] <momomo> however now that onclick causes a 300ms delay on smartphones ... i would like it to be on tap really ...
[12:45:13] <momomo> i guess this is going to be difficult to pull off
[12:45:25] <robertmaxrees> erm, wait.
[12:45:35] <robertmaxrees> so your issue is the touch delay
[12:45:35] <robertmaxrees> ?
[12:45:41] <momomo> yes
[12:45:44] <momomo> on smartphones
[12:45:53] <momomo> or mobile devices
[12:46:00] <pythdasch> You can easily remove it by plugins. Don't know the name anymore
[12:46:07] <robertmaxrees> https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2013/12/300ms-tap-delay-gone-away
[12:46:12] <robertmaxrees> don't need a plugin.
[12:46:16] <robertmaxrees> just use the viewport meta tag.
[12:46:17] <pythdasch> better then
[12:46:34] <robertmaxrees> or use the css touch-action rule.
[12:47:10] <momomo> robertmaxrees: i already have <meta name="viewport" content="user-scalable=no, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, width=device-width">
[12:47:18] <momomo> i don't it it actually works
[12:47:44] <robertmaxrees> is it just a feeling you have or have you actually confirmed?
[12:48:27] <momomo> i've had that tag forever ... and before I changed onclick ( for manually binding ) i remember having that delay
[12:48:44] <robertmaxrees> right, did you read that article i linked?
[12:48:44] <momomo> changed to -> tap
[12:48:56] <momomo> robertmaxrees: try the css thing?
[12:49:10] <robertmaxrees> the article from google on the subject.
[12:49:21] <robertmaxrees> which has both the meta tag as well as css solutions.
[12:49:32] <momomo> robertmaxrees: yes i read it
[12:49:54] <robertmaxrees> so either google is lying orrrr something is broken on your site :)
[12:50:16] <momomo> robertmaxrees: i also have had that in my css
[12:50:25] <momomo> robertmaxrees: i think google is lying
[12:50:30] <robertmaxrees> lol
[12:50:32] <robertmaxrees> good luck then.,
[12:50:34] <momomo> hehe
[12:50:39] <momomo> try it for youself
[12:50:47] <momomo> time it
[12:50:49] <robertmaxrees> i work in mobile development pretty frequently.
[12:50:59] <robertmaxrees> issues with those handlers tends to be caused by something else.
[12:51:08] <robertmaxrees> but the handler initiates in time just fine.
[12:51:51] <momomo> https://hastebin.com/elimuzujex.js
[12:52:48] <robertmaxrees> alerts are bad for testing fwiw.
[12:52:48] <momomo> actually that code is flawed
[12:53:01] <robertmaxrees> i might use a console log and then attach the chrome remote debugger to test that instead.
[12:54:43] <momomo> to really test it i would need to bind on touchstart and compare it with click time
[12:55:07] <robertmaxrees> touchend actually
[12:55:17] <robertmaxrees> as that article points out ;)
[12:55:36] <JyZyXEL> is it possible to use jquery to make a button that creates and deletes a file on the web server?
[12:55:37] <robertmaxrees> i highly encourage you to profile your site.
[12:55:50] <robertmaxrees> JyZyXEL not by itself.
[12:56:07] <robertmaxrees> JyZyXEL you'd need to set up something on the server-side to handle the actual file creation/removal
[12:56:14] <JyZyXEL> robertmaxrees: HTTP PUT?
[12:56:29] <robertmaxrees> JyZyXEL that's just an http method.
[12:56:34] <momomo> robertmaxrees: for testing the time for click to fire touchstart is probably better
[12:56:42] <robertmaxrees> client-side javascrip[t cannot control the filesystem of a server.
[12:56:47] <robertmaxrees> momomo you didn't read the article then.
[12:56:55] <momomo> https://hastebin.com/ihuxiyusej.js
[12:56:57] <JyZyXEL> robertmaxrees: but it could send a PUT request to create the file?
[12:57:10] <momomo> touchstart fires when the finger hits the screen .. touchend later
[12:57:13] <robertmaxrees> JyZyXEL sure, so long as the server-side knows how to handle the put request itself.
[12:57:20] <robertmaxrees> momomo you're conflating what "click" means
[12:57:22] <momomo> so to measure click response time you compare it from first touch
[12:57:32] <robertmaxrees> momomo that's not how click is defined.
[12:57:35] <momomo> anywya.. i think those things actually seem to work
[12:57:38] <robertmaxrees> you're conflating concepts.
[12:57:45] <momomo> not really
[12:57:55] <momomo> there's something else causing the delay though
[12:58:05] <robertmaxrees> so then profile the code.
[12:58:09] <robertmaxrees> like i said earlier ;)
[12:58:36] <momomo> i think it's just that piece of code on the mobile device i am testing on seems to take longer time before something happens :s
[12:58:46] <robertmaxrees> right, so profile it.
[12:58:52] <momomo> ook, thanks
[12:58:55] <robertmaxrees> pretty easy thing to do and it'll tell you what to fix.
[12:59:22] <momomo> robertmaxrees: i dont have a good way doing that on an iphone .. what where you saying earlier about that?
[13:00:01] <robertmaxrees> ghostlab is one option.
[13:00:03] <momomo> i am not on a mac or have xcode installed .. is there a profiler for that? normally I just send the console.log to the server and output them there during development
[13:00:15] <robertmaxrees> I'm not on a mac either.
[13:00:50] <robertmaxrees> i know you can connect chrome dev tools to chrome on android.  weinre is another option.
[13:01:59] <robertmaxrees> alternatively, you can have chrome emulate a mobile device and throttle the CPU and Network to better mimic those devices.
[13:04:25] <momomo> yes, it is a bit tricky .. i'll look into that. thanks for helping figuring out there was something else
[13:05:05] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[14:09:17] <masterasia> I have a JSON string
[14:09:23] <masterasia> that is represented by a table
[14:09:36] <masterasia> I want changes to the table to reflect in the JSON string
[14:09:37] <masterasia> thoughts?
[14:09:52] <masterasia> Like..sorting an element up or down mutates the json
[14:10:16] <taplar> sounds like an array
[14:11:21] <masterasia> taplar, array of js objects
[14:11:26] <masterasia> which..is valid json
[14:11:30] <taplar> yep
[14:11:42] <robertmaxrees> build a function that you can call that spits out the data on an as-needed basis.
[14:11:51] <robertmaxrees> prime $.fn.map() terrifory
[14:11:54] <robertmaxrees> *territory
[14:12:06] <masterasia> spits out the dom representation?
[14:12:27] <masterasia> how would I handle mutating the json when sorting the dom representation?
[14:12:31] <robertmaxrees> the array
[14:12:38] <masterasia> seems hacky to keep track of index
[14:12:40] <robertmaxrees> you just grab a new copy of the data.
[14:12:44] <masterasia> and pop/push elements
[14:12:45] <masterasia> around
[14:12:49] <robertmaxrees> no need to mutate the data.
[14:13:07] <robertmaxrees> just grab a copy when you need it.
[14:13:14] <masterasia> the copy would not have changed
[14:13:19] <masterasia> the canonical copy is the json string
[14:13:28] <masterasia> the dom representation is just a user-interface necessity
[14:13:35] <robertmaxrees> i mean transform the DOM representation into the array you want.
[14:13:44] <masterasia> oh
[14:13:45] <masterasia> Hmm
[14:13:49] <robertmaxrees> hence my $.fn.map suggestion.
[14:13:58] <masterasia> rebuild the json from the DOM
[14:14:02] <masterasia> on every change
[14:14:04] <masterasia> would work
[14:14:10] <masterasia> thanks I'll check that path
[14:14:13] <robertmaxrees> erm
[14:14:19] <robertmaxrees> why do you need to have a static copy somewhere?
[14:15:31] <taplar> why rebuild 'json'
[14:15:35] <robertmaxrees> ^
[14:15:36] <robertmaxrees> heh
[14:15:39] <robertmaxrees> so many questions.,
[14:15:50] <taplar> you understand that json is the string representation of an object, yes?
[14:16:09] <taplar> which gets turned into an object.  then you change the object.  not the json
[14:17:34] <masterasia> robertmaxrees, how would I get the updated json string if not by rebuilding it?
[14:17:39] <masterasia> maybe my language is wrong
[14:18:00] <taplar> why do you need the json?
[14:18:18] <taplar> if all you are doing is adjusting positions for the time being
[14:18:36] <masterasia> at the end - to save it, don't I need to save the json?
[14:18:50] <taplar> ah, then yes, if that is what your endpoint is expecting
[14:18:53] <masterasia> I guess when I'm done - I can call to_json on the object to save the state?
[14:18:58] <taplar> yes
[14:19:03] <taplar> JSON.stringify
[14:19:06] <masterasia> I don't know of any endpoint that accepts a raw js object
[14:19:07] <masterasia> mhm
[14:19:13] <masterasia> but yeah
[14:19:19] <masterasia> you're right - operating on the actual js object
[14:19:26] <masterasia> is the right way to go
[14:45:40] <phelix> I have a form with a select field. It comes default with one of the options having selected="selected" in my jquery I have added $('select').val(0) and also $('select option:selected').removeAttr('selected') and if i hit submit the form is still returning the default selected value.
[14:45:47] <phelix> Anyone know a fix for this? Or maybe I am doing this wrong.
[14:50:33] <duch_kazatel> $('select').val(0) - the ,val() needs to be the value of the default option.
[14:52:24] <phelix> Yes I want the default value to be 0 but by default its 2
[14:52:37] <robertmaxrees> make a fiddle.
[14:52:47] <phelix> using $('select').val(0) loading page and submitting form I still get a 2 in the form post
[14:52:55] <phelix> Well the fiddle won't show results of the form post will it?
[14:53:13] <phelix> its changing it in the HTML.. but the form seems to still be giving me a 2 when submited
[14:53:43] <robertmaxrees> wait what?
[14:54:03] <robertmaxrees> oooh.  back up - your issue isn't the display but the actual value?
[14:54:12] <phelix> I load a page. This page has a form and the default value of this select field is 2
[14:54:17] <phelix> yes
[14:54:29] <phelix> when I post the form and hit submit I am still getting the value of 2
[14:55:13] <robertmaxrees> you can always just console.log() out the .val()
[14:55:37] <phelix> Well how can I update it so that when I submit the form it returns a 0 instead?
[14:58:42] <phelix> is this not possible to do?
[16:16:22] <taplar> whop whop whop whop
[16:49:21] <phelix> if I have a select field and its parent element is hidden Could that be why when I change the value using like $('#select-id').val(0) its not working when I submit the form?
[16:51:04] <taplar> i wouldn't think so
[16:51:41] <phelix> for the life of me I can not change the select value of this field. I mean it changes on the html etc. But when I submit the form its still posting the default value. Not sure what is happening.
[16:51:52] <taplar> you got a fiddle showing the issue?
[16:52:15] <phelix> Well I can't replicate it with a fiddle because you can't see its not working until you actually post the form.
[16:52:29] <taplar> you can fake a form post
[16:52:36] <phelix> with a fiddle you can?
[16:52:38] <taplar> or cancel
[16:52:55] <taplar> you can bind on the form submit, cancel it, and see what would have been sent
[16:55:16] <phelix> https://jsfiddle.net/0q15eLLj/
[16:55:52] <phelix> those are the 3 different ways I have tried to do this. It shows 0 for the value. But posting its giving me a 2
[16:56:11] <taplar> uh, none of this is dealing with the form submit
[16:56:42] <phelix> Yea, i need to figure out how to disable the form on a fiddle
[16:57:07] <taplar> the same as any event.  you preventDefault() it
[17:00:29] <phelix> https://jsfiddle.net/0q15eLLj/3/
[17:02:00] <taplar> why are you dropdowns disabled?
[17:02:20] <phelix> Because when having more than one item selected they need to be 2
[17:02:40] <phelix> only when a single room is available are they disabled.
[17:02:40] <taplar> disabled elements are not submitted man
[17:02:54] <phelix> ok... Well that makes sense then
[17:04:06] <JrWebDev> when i do a post form jquery doesnt seem to recognize thats in the input boxes...the input boxes gets data loaded from database...when i start page for first time everything works fine but when post form that directs to current page, jquery/js doesnt work until i click in the input box
[17:05:02] <taplar> JrWebDev: would need to see what you are doing to debug
[17:07:21] <JrWebDev> thats gonna be tough
[17:07:28] <JrWebDev> ill come back tomorrow
[17:09:11] <taplar> i don't need the whole thing.  i just need more information about the logic that is failing.  "doesn't work until" doesn't really tell me what logic led up to that
[17:11:04] <duch_kazatel> heh
[17:11:43] <phelix> can you add the .prop and a .val in a single line? like $('element').prop('xx', false).val(0); ?
[17:11:59] <phelix> or is there a cleaner way to do this than just having 2 seperate lines for that?
[17:12:13] <robertmaxrees> why do you think "shorter" == "cleaner"?
[17:12:20] <phelix> I dunno
[17:12:34] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[17:12:34] <phelix> haha, was just curious because there 2 lines right in a row on the same selector
[17:12:48] <robertmaxrees> you're storing the selector in a var, right?
[17:12:57] <phelix> no
[17:13:01] <robertmaxrees> you should.
[17:19:13] <Keytap> Just out of curiosity, any reason jQuery doesn't have accessor functions for the scroll height/width?
[17:19:39] <robertmaxrees> "scroll height/width"?
[17:19:45] <taplar> there's a scrollTop()
[17:20:04] <robertmaxrees> you mean the total area of a scrollable element outside of the visible space?
[17:20:07] <Keytap> taplar:  Not quite what I'm looking for
[17:20:11] <robertmaxrees> like, the scrollable area?
[17:20:11] <Keytap> robertmaxrees: Correct
[17:20:13] <robertmaxrees> it has them.
[17:20:20] <robertmaxrees> they're the normalk height/width of that element.
[17:20:28] <Keytap> Huh?  No they're not
[17:20:34] <Keytap> That yields the renderable area
[17:20:43] <Keytap> *width/height of the renderable area
[17:20:45] <robertmaxrees> not if you target the right element :)
[17:20:45] <taplar> window height - body height
[17:21:01] <taplar> or something, logically
[17:22:10] <robertmaxrees> Keytap https://jsfiddle.net/c5tgtjov/
[17:25:49] <Keytap> However, if the parent element has padding, that width does not accurately represent the scroll width.
[17:29:17] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/c5tgtjov/1/
[17:31:30] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/c5tgtjov/2/
[17:34:52] <robertmaxrees> Keytap you could always put in a request.
[17:35:27] <robertmaxrees> though my guess is that you want the width and height of the child elelement + the padding of that parent.
[17:36:05] <robertmaxrees> which is a little more explicit.
[18:04:36] <maxer> A little problem- i have a function defined in the global jquery namespace in a js file -> jQuery.getChartData = function() but i get $.getChartData is not a function when i call it from my html file even after the script load
[18:04:54] <maxer> any ideas on this simple problem?
[18:05:01] <taplar> are you loading multiple jquery versions?
[18:05:44] <taplar> and did you verify that '$' is indeed jQuery?
[18:06:09] <maxer> not loading multiple versions
[18:06:43] <maxer> i use the function in an onlclick handler which works but not when the page loads
[18:07:04] <taplar> an onclick="" ?
[18:08:05] <taplar> and how are you creating the method?  is it in a document ready or an IIFE?
[18:10:56] <robertmaxrees> maxer basically, we need more info :)
[18:15:56] <maxer> robertmaxrees: ok i dumped the javascript into this http://jsbin.com/hisopoyika/edit?html,css,js,output
[18:17:42] <taplar> when is that on() logic ran?
[18:19:31] <maxer> before the closing </body>  and after the <script src=“”></script>
[18:20:11] <taplar> same thing for the part that does not work?
[18:21:23] <maxer> yes they are both in the same <script> tag
[18:22:12] <taplar> are you in an ES6 compliant browser?
[18:22:13] <maxer> taplar: my bad- simple mistake i had the wrong include in the wrong order
[18:22:20] <taplar> ah
[18:22:27] <maxer> i apologise :$
[18:23:18] <taplar> side note, if this stuff is indeed at the bottom of your page, you don't need that doc ready
[18:24:11] <maxer> i know- i was pulling my hair out and throwing everything in there in order to get it to work
[18:24:26] <taplar> heh
[18:25:11] <Keytap> Is it possible to change an animation end property values mid animation?
[18:25:12] <momomo> is there a way to check if an element supports a certain event ?
[18:25:22] <momomo> for instance if an element supports onclick or ontouchend
[18:25:35] <taplar> everything can be clicked or touched, afaik
[18:25:49] <momomo> taplar: i mean as an attribute event
[18:25:56] <taplar> same thing
[18:25:57] <momomo> if it's settable
[18:26:26] <momomo> taplar: ontouchend is not working if set as an attribute on the element directly in chrome
[18:26:31] <momomo> in ios browser it is firing
[18:27:06] <arog> hello
[18:27:18] <momomo> i can set both onclick and ontouchend but i need a way to avoid firing both of them
[18:27:33] <arog> I am doing a $.post()  and in my server I am returning a string that has content-type as text/plain that I want to save on the client side to a file
[18:27:36] <momomo> i can only do that if onclick i can see if the element supports ontouchend
[18:27:52] <arog> in my .done() if I look at the data, it is the string, but it is not giving me the option to download it
[18:27:52] <taplar> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/touchend
[18:27:54] <arog> any idea how I can do that>
[18:28:08] <momomo> can you do this.isAddedAsAnEventllistener('ontouchend')  ?
[18:28:33] <taplar> arog: look into 'javascript data link' i think
[18:28:38] <arog> tjamls
[18:28:40] <arog> *thanks
[18:29:19] <taplar> let me make sure i'm understanding this momomo
[18:29:20] <momomo> taplar: funny but in firefox only onclick fires
[18:29:28] <momomo> as an attribute that is
[18:29:33] <momomo> like in chrome
[18:29:40] <taplar> both the chrome and ios browser you are playing with are on a mobile device or a touch monitor?
[18:30:11] <momomo> hmm .. no it's on desktop .. i guess touchend doesnt work there .. but my problem still persist though
[18:30:17] <momomo> i think
[18:30:27] <taplar> a mouse click does not invoke a touch
[18:30:30] <momomo> i guess i can check if it's a mobile device and include one or the other
[18:30:31] <taplar> is why i ask
[18:31:18] <momomo> taplar: not sure that's safe though ... although the fallback could be onclick ... i'd rather try to figure out if there is a way an event is supported by an element as an attribute
[18:31:31] <momomo> can you read this from eventlistner stack somehow ?
[18:31:38] <taplar> not really
[18:31:43] <taplar> afaik
[18:33:05] <taplar> you might can find that information from the html living standard, but might take some digging.  or simply try to put it on and see what happens.  or google
[18:33:45] <taplar> but like i said, i can't think of anything that you can't put a click or touch event on.  except maybe like <head>
[18:34:05] <momomo> taplar: i'd like to detect if it's a touch screen .. is there a way ?
[18:34:06] <taplar> anything that renders to the body, click/touch away
[18:34:14] <momomo> rather than detect if it's a mobile device
[18:34:32] <taplar> not that i'm familiar with
[18:34:43] <momomo> taplar: it's just that i can't bind both .. on touch both will fire
[18:35:22] <momomo> https://medium.com/@david.gilbertson/the-only-way-to-detect-touch-with-javascript-7791a3346685
[18:35:31] <momomo> "But wait, I want to know before the user touches the screen" - You can't
[18:35:57] <taplar> i've circumvented the issue in the past by forcing everything to be a change event
[18:37:45] <taplar> though from that page you linked i wonder if you could bind on touchstart, cancel the event, and if it would still fire the click event afterwards
[18:38:11] <momomo> i found this
[18:38:12] <momomo> https://hacks.mozilla.org/2013/04/detecting-touch-its-the-why-not-the-how/
[18:38:15] <momomo> seems there is hope
[18:39:10] <taplar> ah, so it's looking for if the property exists on the window.
[18:39:47] <taplar> that seems odd.  i'd expect a non-mobile device to also have the property available on the window
[18:40:41] <taplar> huh, nope.  atleast not in my ff
[18:40:51] <momomo> not in chrome either
[18:41:07] <momomo> but you cant do it for touchend
[18:41:07] <momomo> ('ontouchstart' in window ? 'touchend' : 'click');
[18:41:08] <momomo> haha
[18:44:57] <taplar> this is the idea of what i've done in the past to funnel click/touch events into a change event. https://jsfiddle.net/7L5b1dus/
[18:46:09] <momomo> taplar: it has a 300 ms delay on mobile
[18:46:19] <momomo> which is what i am trying to avoid
[18:46:27] <momomo> you can do onclick on touch devices
[18:46:36] <momomo> but then you get the delay
[18:46:47] <momomo> when in fullscreen at least in mobile ...
[18:47:42] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/7L5b1dus/1/  same 300 delay?
[18:49:48] <momomo> taplar: yes, inspect in chrome .. click on mobile device and then click away ... it is slower than the desktop .. looks like a delay
[18:50:06] <momomo> but interesting with the change event ... will that fire for everything or just click/touch ?
[18:50:21] <taplar> both
[18:51:16] <momomo> i think for me i can bind using the ontouchstart in window thingy .. it's working
[18:51:57] <momomo> although that might break older devices
[18:54:38] <momomo> or actually not .. my mistake .. it will always fallback to click
[18:56:47] <taplar> you might hitup ##javascript and see what they think
[18:56:59] <taplar> a lot of what we're talking about isn't really jQ
[19:02:20] <taplar> hasta luego mi amigos
[21:04:39] <docmur> If I have the css selctor input.className, can I use a single jQuery selector to get that, or do I have to first find inputs and then the className?
[21:04:43] <docmur> input .className
[21:15:17] <docmur> got it
[21:15:28] <docmur> $("input[class='className']");
[21:18:48] <shoky> $("input.className")
