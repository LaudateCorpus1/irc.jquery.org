[04:22:21] <skypce_> i have this returned in console
[04:22:22] <skypce_> <p>Message:Arrival:[object Object]</span><p>Number of months:undefined</p><p>Number of adults:undefined</p><p>Number of kids:undefined</p><p>Referral:undefined</p>
[04:23:12] <skypce_> but if i look single elements in console and i change it it works fine
[04:23:12] <skypce_>                                          3 kids
[04:35:30] <pavonia> What is that supposed to mean?
[04:36:14] <devi8> skypce, give me just a minute
[04:47:39] <devi8> skypce_ try this: https://codepen.io/jaseinatl/pen/wRmbBM
[04:47:50] <devi8> it needs some work, but it gives you the idea.
[04:48:45] <devi8> when ever an input value changes, it checks to make sure it's not blank and marks its container as valid. then checks if all fields are valid before compiling the message that it places in the results panel
[04:52:38] <devi8> there are better ways to do all of this, but in the context of your question, I hope it helps.

[08:51:54] <henni> the /jquery.garlands.js?20160801  is the script?
[08:51:59] <Guest58> why not use .load in current page? why call another html?

[14:27:46] <jak2000> http://jsfiddle.net/jamiguel77/1L5fb6hu/2/ how to hide the rows with amount(column) = 0.00  ?
[14:27:48] <jak2000> hi all
[14:52:15] <twg> Hi.  I have a simple menu working to toggle showing sub menus when the parent item is clicked.  However I'm trying to figure out how to toggle the view of the current item when a new item is clicked on and then toggle the view of that sub-menu.
[15:33:26] <estodiMania> Hello, I hope someone can help me a little bit. I want to make a single form and with this form i want to search airports. I have found a api to use, this one: https://developer.flightstats.com/api-docs/airports/v1 but how do I do different api calls based on the input in the form?
[15:34:09] <estodiMania> sometimes i want to search based on country and sometimes i want search based on IATA code.
[15:34:42] <estodiMania> I want to use one form with different inputs or even 1 single input.
[15:38:23] <Woet> estodiMania: not seeing any CORS headers on that API, are you sure you can use it using ajax?
[15:38:50] <estodiMania> Hmm that is a good one :)!
[15:39:28] <estodiMania> but let's say it works with AJAX, I can't wrap my head around what a right solution is.
[15:39:45] <Woet> estodiMania: shouldn't you establish whether it works with AJAX first?
[15:40:00] <Woet> estodiMania: you would just have to call all API endpoints and combine the results.
[15:40:26] <estodiMania> You are right I should check it, but this is just an example API.
[15:41:14] <estodiMania> @Woet is it possible to do that with a single call?
[15:41:31] <Woet> estodiMania: why?
[15:42:04] <estodiMania> I don't know was just thinking it's better.
[15:42:28] <Woet> estodiMania: none of this is remotely related to jQuery.
[15:42:48] <Woet> estodiMania: you need to ask the API developers if you want a call that does something else than what they offer.
[15:43:02] <estodiMania> I want to practice and create a "live search" with jQuery and AJAX
[15:43:30] <Woet> estodiMania: none of those API calls support suggestions or autocompletion.
[15:43:53] <estodiMania> Ok, I need to find another one
[15:44:05] <Woet> estodiMania: they also charge $0.0030 per API call.
[15:44:17] <Woet> estodiMania: can you please put some effort in before asking questions?
[15:44:43] <estodiMania> You are right, thank you form your help
[15:44:49] <estodiMania> for*
[15:44:59] <Woet> because you're asking a question about an API that 1) doesn't do what you need, 2) doesn't work using ajax, 3) costs money
[17:40:19] <arosen>  I'm wondering if there is anyway to reduce the video recording size if the user passes it in via  <input type="file" accept="video/*" capture="environment" > ?  I'm running into an issue where the video is so high quality it uses up to much space to send over the network.
