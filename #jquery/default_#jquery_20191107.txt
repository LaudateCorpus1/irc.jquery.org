[01:24:03] <Crash1hd> Hey everyone would something like this work? $("#buttontostyle").removeClass('[class^="bg"]');
[01:24:11] <Crash1hd> I cant seem to get it to work
[01:53:06] <Cork> Crash1hd: no, it would not
[01:53:14] <Cork> Crash1hd: and that is mainly cause it is a bad idea
[01:53:33] <Crash1hd> Ok is there a simple way to do something like that?
[01:53:40] <Cork> removing everything unknown, means the element can't get features from other code without this code breaking it
[01:53:42] <Crash1hd> Without having to create a func or loop
[01:53:47] <Cork> you should avoid it
[01:53:57] <Cork> add a list with the known classes you want to remove
[01:54:23] <Crash1hd> Well if the classes have the same beginning though
[01:54:44] <Crash1hd> I guess it would be just as easy to write out .remove('...').remove.... etc.
[01:55:06] <Cork> you can write a list in one removeClass, they are space separated by default
[01:55:20] <Cork> removeClass('class1 class2 class3 ...)
[01:56:22] <Crash1hd> Oh ok cool thanks :)
[01:56:28] <Cork> np
[01:57:21] <Crash1hd> Over architecting as usual lol
[08:47:05] <Goosenf> q. How do you comfort a JavaScript bug? a. You console it
[08:56:36] <Goosenf> When a JavaScript date has gone bad, “Don’t call me, I’ll callback you. I promise!”
[08:56:53] <Goosenf> q. Why was the JavaScript developer sad? a. Because he didn’t Node how to Express himself
[08:57:20] <Goosenf> Two JavaScript developers walked into the variable bar. Ouch!
[10:34:05] <ButtDog> I'm looking to inject Jquery to a website and upload a file to a file field and get the progress. Is this possible in JQuery? If so, where should I start looking? Any notable functions?
[10:49:54] <spinningcat> do you know how to fix this error https://jsfiddle.net/0egx3w9q/ please check the cosole i am using chart.js datalabels plugin
[11:29:50] <Cork> ButtDog: you don't upload to a field
[11:31:41] <Cork> ButtDog: you either add the file to an ajax call or make a form post with the file field
[11:31:42] <Cork> ButtDog: for progress you need support from the web server
[11:33:35] <ButtDog> Can you think of any other methods?
[13:36:25] <ButtDog> Cork, well if you upload the file aren't you essentially streaming it in chunks?
