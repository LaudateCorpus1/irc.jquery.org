[00:00:50] <Whiskey> I have this code, $.get("url", function(result) {$('#0 > pre.toggleable.Text').html('<span>' + result + '</span>');}); <-- is it anyway to tell how many lines it should load? If it should take it from the tail or top?
[00:00:52] <hellyeah> nodist:  i am sorry i disconnected
[00:03:11] <nodist> hellyeah,  is $tbodyTR.length meant to be 144?
[00:03:30] <hellyeah> yes
[00:03:55] <nodist> sorry im just confused on what your trying to do
[00:04:24] <Kartagis> Whiskey: how 'bout result.length?
[00:04:43] <hellyeah> nodist:  i suppose this for loop works 15 times
[00:05:16] <hellyeah> nodist:  i have 144 rows table i splitted into 10 small tables
[00:05:34] <nodist> oh so it should have the thead 10 times?
[00:05:34] <hellyeah> and i want to put every piece of table under header
[00:05:47] <hellyeah> 15 times
[00:05:52] <nodist> ok
[00:05:55] <hellyeah> 15 * 10 = 150
[00:06:00] <hellyeah> my table has 144 rows
[00:06:15] <hellyeah> 0....10 10....20 20....30 .... 140...150
[00:06:29] <hellyeah> so for loop will work 15 times i assume
[00:06:41] <hellyeah> i just want to add tr of tbody to each header
[00:07:05] <hellyeah> first header 0...10 row second header 20...30 ... fifteenth header 140...150
[00:08:26] <hellyeah> nodist:  if you have time please check the console http://jsfiddle.net/10r8upvu/57/
[00:09:16] <hellyeah> okey
[00:09:17] <hellyeah> i did
[00:09:46] <hellyeah> nodist:  i dont know the reason but using one true in clone function fix the problem http://jsfiddle.net/10r8upvu/58/
[00:10:23] <nodist> lol yeah I would look into it more
[00:10:59] <hellyeah> second true will force to clone event handlers i guess
[00:11:07] <hellyeah> i couldnt solve the relation
[00:13:35] <Whiskey> nodist: get give me total count of chars not rows
[00:13:54] <Whiskey> oo i mean Kartagis
[00:18:10] <hellyeah> i dont know how to bind this small tables into button
[00:18:23] <hellyeah> i guess i need button
[00:21:11] <steve-mcbutts> buttens
[00:21:45] <hellyeah> hey
[00:21:53] <hellyeah> i want to create a button
[00:22:02] <hellyeah> is there an easy way with jquery?
[00:22:46] <nodist> you could just create the html and append or, or jQuery has a way of making html elements
[00:23:31] <nodist> eg $('body').html($('<div>', {class: 'spinner'}));
[00:23:42] <nodist> https://coderwall.com/p/evmqoa/creating-dom-elements-with-jquery-in-a-more-elegant-way
[00:24:01] <hellyeah> nodist:  http://api.jquery.com/jquery.parsehtml/
[00:27:13] <hellyeah> nodist:  so just one line ha https://jsfiddle.net/2rtyt176/
[00:27:27] <nodist> yeah
[00:28:14] <hellyeah> seems correct
[00:29:08] <nodist> var button = $('button',{type:'text', id:'test', class'yourclass', attr:value});
[00:29:40] <nodist> var button = $('<button>',{type:'text', id:'test', class:'yourclass', attr:value});
[00:29:41] <nodist> woops
[00:30:00] <hellyeah> attr:value
[00:30:03] <hellyeah> do i need ""
[00:30:47] <nodist> yeah
[00:31:30] <nodist> https://jsfiddle.net/cpzzLm4s/
[00:32:19] <hellyeah> how can i make it appear in result screen?
[00:32:23] <limpep> Hi I am trying to parse json data, to display it using Hightcharts http://pastebin.com/xJtnByrY but this isn't quite right
[00:32:39] <hellyeah> humm
[00:32:42] <hellyeah> ic
[00:32:51] <nodist> I would need an example of the screen
[00:33:17] <hellyeah> jsfiddle
[00:33:20] <hellyeah> try this
[00:35:54] <nodist> limpep do you have a working(or not working example) online?
[00:36:57] <limpep> nodist: Hi not online no
[00:39:06] <nodist> limpep im trying a fiddle now
[00:39:28] <limpep> nodist: thanks
[00:44:22] <nodist> still goinging
[00:45:48] <limpep> nodist: ok I am still trying to fix it on my end too
[00:56:01] <nodist> I think i got it one sec
[00:56:42] <limpep> nodist: wow nice
[01:00:42] <nodist> nope, but here is what i have so far https://jsfiddle.net/mxz5cgxr/5/
[01:04:55] <limpep> nodist: thanks, I'll give this a shot on my end

[01:11:16] <limpep> nodist: thanks dude this is what I was after
[01:13:05] <Whiskey> I have 16 spans, how do i overwrite whats in last span only?
[01:13:22] <nodist> you could try :last-child
[01:13:59] <Whiskey> I have like this
[01:14:00] <Whiskey> $('#Time > pre.toggleable.Text:last-child').append('<span class="red">' + result.split(/\r?\n/).slice(-3).join('\n') + '</span>');
[01:14:20] <nodist> hellyeah were you trying to post a paste?
[01:16:18] <nodist> Whiskey do you have a paste example?
[01:16:38] <Whiskey> no not yet :)
[01:17:32] <p2sk> Whiskey: with append you add to that last span another span. try: $('#Time > pre.toggleable.Text:last-child').replaceWith('<span class="red">' + result.split(/\r?\n/).slice(-3).join('\n') + '</span>');
[01:20:40] <Whiskey> i have slove it :) thanks
[01:25:16] <lalalaaa> Hello! Why am I getting `helloWorld.appendTo is not a function` at http://jsfiddle.net/rcqr5wbr/ ?
[01:26:14] <lalalaaa> Sorry, http://jsfiddle.net/rcqr5wbr/1/
[01:26:34] <Xatenev> lalalaaa: http://jsfiddle.net/rcqr5wbr/4/
[01:26:53] <lalalaaa> Xatenev: Aaaah
[01:27:07] <Xatenev> lalalaaa: if u return '<p>' + text + '</p>
[01:27:09] <Xatenev> then you have a strnig
[01:27:17] <Xatenev> but u need a jquery OBJECT in order to use jquery functions on them
[01:27:21] <lalalaaa> Xatenev: I've noticed I've had to wrap stuff in $() before, like raw HTML fetched via ajax.. why is that?
[01:27:27] <lalalaaa> oh i see i see
[01:27:30] <Xatenev> so we wrap it into $() so we make it a jquery object
[01:27:33] <newbie|2> nodedfree:
[01:27:35] <newbie|2> ops
[01:27:37] <lalalaaa> that is awesome
[01:27:41] <lalalaaa> thank you so much Xatenev
[01:28:45] <hellyeah> i defined class of button as buttonClass and i gave and id to each button when i click any button there i suppose to get smt but i didnt get anything why http://jsfiddle.net/10r8upvu/74/
[01:29:30] <hellyeah> i added button to html
[01:29:35] <hellyeah> so button is in DOM
[01:29:44] <hellyeah> why i could take "alert"
[01:30:15] <nodist> change the #buttonClass to .buttonClass
[01:31:02] <nodist> hellyeah ^
[01:31:10] <hellyeah> #buttonClass
[01:31:32] <nodist> hellyeah http://jsfiddle.net/10r8upvu/75/
[01:31:41] <hellyeah> wgat does that mean ^
[01:32:29] <hellyeah> humm
[01:32:49] <hellyeah> hmm
[01:32:51] <hellyeah> i did typos
[01:33:04] <nodist> sorry i meant look at the previous line, it was addressed to you but I didn't say your name
[01:35:08] <hellyeah> nodist:  one more thing i give id to each button but that line doesnt work why if (("$buttonClass").att("id") === 0) {   http://jsfiddle.net/10r8upvu/78/
[01:35:42] <hellyeah> it is 0 to 14
[01:35:46] <hellyeah> it must work
[01:35:54] <hellyeah> ops
[01:36:05] <hellyeah> typo again
[01:36:36] <nodist> hellyeah http://jsfiddle.net/10r8upvu/80/
[01:37:25] <hellyeah> nodist:  this keyword take the element you clicked right?
[01:37:31] <nodist> yeah
[01:38:18] <hellyeah> okey
[01:38:26] <hellyeah> i have one little problem
[01:38:32] <hellyeah> in this case i have 15 button
[01:38:40] <hellyeah> but i created it dynamically
[01:38:45] <hellyeah> it can be 100 or 1000
[01:38:55] <hellyeah> i cannot write condition for each button
[01:39:15] <hellyeah> but each button is created dynamically is responsible for doing something
[01:39:22] <hellyeah> hmm dunno how i can do that
[01:39:37] <hellyeah> you will see tables over butto  right
[01:39:48] <hellyeah> i splitted big tables into 15 small tables
[01:39:59] <hellyeah> my aim is to show each table when you click button
[01:40:08] <hellyeah> bind each small table to a button
[01:40:22] <hellyeah> does it make sense?
[01:40:32] <nodist> yeah give me a sec
[01:41:08] <hellyeah> hmm
[01:41:41] <hellyeah> at the same time i am learning the stuff
[01:41:48] <hellyeah> can i ask if  dont understand
[01:41:58] <nodist> sure
[01:41:58] <hellyeah> it is my life
[01:42:02] <hellyeah> is not ow never
[01:42:03] <nodist> im no expert ethier
[01:42:07] <hellyeah> it is not an never
[01:42:12] <hellyeah> i am gonna live forever
[01:42:19] <hellyeah> i just want to stay alive bongjovi :D
[01:42:26] <hellyeah> nodist:  i am total noob

[01:46:53] <hellyeah> nodist:  http://api.jquery.com/live/
[01:47:02] <hellyeah> is this mthod useful?
[01:48:13] <Uhkis> no
[01:48:34] <hellyeah> ah okey
[01:48:47] <Uhkis> "As of jQuery 1.7, the .live() method is deprecated"
[01:48:55] <Uhkis> use on()
[01:49:00] <BenL90> Anyone, do anyone know how to format number to local, example for US like adding commas after 3 digits input of number
[01:51:42] <nodist> hellyeah, i changed it so the header is in the thead and the body is in the tbody http://jsfiddle.net/10r8upvu/80/
[01:53:57] <hellyeah> lemme check
[01:55:17] <hellyeah> nodist:
[01:55:21] <hellyeah> thank you
[01:58:12] <hellyeah> nodist:  just one more thing
[01:58:26] <hellyeah> how can i assign spesific thing to each button automatically?
[01:58:30] <xvure> BenL90 -  string.replace(/\B(?=(\d{3})+(?!\d))/g, ',')
[01:58:34] <nodist> hellyeah here is the example of changing the table based on each button http://jsfiddle.net/10r8upvu/83/
[01:58:55] <nodist> it changes the second column of the first row background color to white based on the table
[01:58:57] <BenL90> xvure: Is there any fiffle?
[01:59:00] <BenL90> fiddle
[01:59:07] <xvure> two seconds
[02:00:00] <hellyeah> my aim is little different
[02:00:04] <hellyeah> anyway launch time
[02:00:09] <hellyeah> thank you nodist
[02:00:10] <hellyeah> brb
[02:00:16] <nodist> your welcome
[02:02:09] <xvure> BenL90 -  http://jsfiddle.net/07jyktek/
[02:04:10] <steve-mcbutts> Whiskey: you can also try :last and
[02:04:16] <steve-mcbutts> wow that was a long time ago
[02:04:22] <BenL90> xvure: Okay then, hmmm, If I use it on input, in theorical'ly, is that work? And If I do SUM of the input is that things can cause problem in plus, minus, divide or other? as In Indonesia the standard is dot (.)
[02:05:55] <xvure> Sorry, I can't understand your question
[02:08:52] <BenL90> xvure: Sorry for my bad english, if I have <input> that have been formated with your code, eg 127.500 when I have other <input> 123.600 when i sum them using js or jquery, is that possible the number change to 301.100? or make a result on a <span> 301.100?(In this case when the first input is 127500 and second is 123600).
[02:08:56] <Whiskey> steve-mcbutts: ::D
[02:11:48] <mdev> Ben $( "input[value*='127.500']" ).val( "$127,500" );
[02:12:06] <mdev> changes 127.500 to $127,500
[02:12:08] <mdev> can be whateve ryo want
[02:14:26] <BenL90> mdev: No I mean like in Excel. When you format it, even you change, it back formarted
[02:17:06] <Herehere> Guys I have this function https://dpaste.de/4tWu - How can I submit form without clicking on button 'Submit'?
[02:18:01] <Herehere> I have this     $(".employee_input").on('change',function(){
[02:18:14] <Herehere> if something change I want to submit form
[02:18:37] <Herehere> It would be a 'ghost' submit
[02:21:42] <gurke_> Herehere, you can do that with ajax
[02:21:46] <xvure> BenL90 - You would need to take the values, strip the delimiter then add them together, before adding the delimiter back in
[02:21:53] <xvure> http://jsfiddle.net/07jyktek/1/
[02:22:01] <Xatenev> Herehere: u have the code for it alrdy posted, not? :p
[02:22:16] <Xatenev> just wrap it into a $('.employee_input').on('change', function() { like u alrdy wrote
[02:22:33] <Xatenev> and type data: frm.serialize();
[02:22:34] <Xatenev> and ur done
[02:22:35] <Xatenev> :)
[02:23:48] <Herehere> gurke_: Xatenev: I can console log serialized input, but on my server I got None
[02:23:49] <Herehere> https://dpaste.de/PaJY
[02:23:59] <Herehere> this is something related with data:{}
[02:24:09] <Herehere> I just guess
[02:24:10] <BenL90> xvure: So 2 times, Add, and remove
[02:24:18] <Xatenev> Herehere: what are u writing there xD
[02:24:23] <Xatenev> data { employee: $(this)... wtf is all that? :p
[02:24:27] <Xatenev> data: frm.serialize();
[02:24:35] <BenL90> xvure: Then how to make this anyway :o http://jsfiddle.net/wdm954/8HDem/ But I can't do delete or do backspace
[02:24:42] <Herehere> Xatenev: Aah thanks, xD
[02:25:16] <Xatenev> Herehere: works?
[02:26:12] <Herehere> Xatenev: Yes it works thanks, but it sends every objects. Can I make it to send only object from one field?
[02:26:31] <steve-mcbutts> BenL90: what are you trying to do?
[02:26:39] <steve-mcbutts> sum two input values?
[02:26:42] <Xatenev> Herehere: so you only want the "ghost submit" for one field?
[02:26:53] <Herehere> Xatenev: yup
[02:27:00] <BenL90> steve-mcbutts: sum to input value, but make the input work like this http://jsfiddle.net/wdm954/8HDem/
[02:27:01] <Xatenev> well, just select the field then :)
[02:27:13] <Xatenev> Herehere: adjust the selector and instead of .serialize() use .val();
[02:28:03] <steve-mcbutts> BenL90: you don't want backspace to work?
[02:28:14] <Xatenev> Herehere: solved? :)
[02:28:27] <BenL90> steve-mcbutts: No anyway, I want it work, so that's the problem also
[02:28:27] <steve-mcbutts> oh i see
[02:28:34] <steve-mcbutts> you want to use Mask.js then
[02:28:48] <Herehere> Xatenev: testing :)
[02:31:12] <steve-mcbutts> 1 sec BenL90
[02:31:51] <BenL90> steve-mcbutts: Sorry for bothering, I need a lot of jquery course :s I'm learn jquery by myself so I'm not expert.. :s
[02:33:12] <Herehere> Xatenev: val() not working, only serialize() gives me right result. Thank you very much! :D
[02:33:58] <steve-mcbutts> BenL90: i cant get it to work with jsfiddle but here's the script im talking about: http://igorescobar.github.io/jQuery-Mask-Plugin/
[02:34:20] <steve-mcbutts> BenL90: source code is here https://github.com/igorescobar/jQuery-Mask-Plugin
[02:34:29] <steve-mcbutts> that will mask the input properly
[02:34:40] <steve-mcbutts> just set it to recursive and set a pattern
[02:34:45] <Xatenev> Herehere: ok den, good
[02:34:48] <steve-mcbutts> to add the input values
[02:35:03] <BenL90> steve-mcbutts: Then how to make it change to normal number when sent?
[02:35:04] <steve-mcbutts> just bind a change() event to both inputs
[02:35:14] <steve-mcbutts> change to normal number?
[02:35:16] <steve-mcbutts> oh i see
[02:35:23] <steve-mcbutts> the commas are for number formatting
[02:35:48] <steve-mcbutts> simple, take the input value and call value.replace(',', '');
[02:36:00] <steve-mcbutts> value = parseInt(value)
[02:36:04] <steve-mcbutts> and you've got a number
[02:36:22] <Herehere> guys how can I get first numbers in this string? "employee=10129&employee=10629"
[02:36:24] <BenL90> no I mean when I do submit form anyway
[02:36:46] <steve-mcbutts> when you submit the form you want to convert the input value to a number, yeah?
[02:36:55] <BenL90> steve-mcbutts: yes
[02:36:59] <steve-mcbutts> then what i said
[02:37:08] <steve-mcbutts> grab the input value and convert it before sending
[02:37:54] <Herehere> nevermind got this .replace( /(^.+)(\w\d+\w)(.+$)/i,'$2');
[02:38:14] <steve-mcbutts> lol Herehere
[02:38:27] <Herehere> xD
[02:38:33] <Herehere> this works .replace( /(^.+\D)(\d+)(\D.+$)/i,'$2');
[02:38:53] <BenL90> I can make it work on docs ready but not when sent. If i use .submit(); will it work? Or I just try it to check it out?
[02:39:34] <BenL90> steve-mcbutts: Is that possible?
[02:40:20] <Uhkis> Herehere: by first numbers do you mean those 1's or 10129
[02:40:29] <Herehere> 10129
[02:40:37] <Herehere> update: its not working xD
[02:41:41] <Uhkis> Herehere: .match(/\d/)
[02:41:45] <Uhkis> oops
[02:41:49] <Uhkis> Herehere: .match(/\d+/)

[02:48:05] <Uhkis> or just everything
[02:53:13] <Herehere> my server doesnt detect this                 data: { employee:  $(".employee_input").serialize().match(/\d+/),
[02:54:19] <Herehere> in console log I have Array [ "10629" ]
[02:54:22] <Uhkis> sounds like you actually want $(".employee_input").get(0).val()
[02:57:33] <unseensoul> How can I implement different templates only whenever I want using jQueryUI?
[03:23:18] <hellyeah> hey there
[03:28:10] <Whiskey> <div id="this" class="dataViewBox-Data"> <pre class="toggleable Text"> <-- how do you change this to SPAN insted of PRE
[03:28:33] <hellyeah> hey
[03:28:56] <Whiskey> or maybe just remove the pre tag would work two i think
[03:33:27] <Herehere> Uhkis: your method .match(/\d+/)  cut digits from string and put it to an array
[03:33:41] <Herehere> in console log I have Array [ "10129" ]
[03:35:32] <Uhkis> and?
[03:36:05] <Herehere> Uhkis: and in backend I got nothing
[03:36:23] <Uhkis> if you want it as string, just add [0]
[03:37:08] <Herehere> lol thx xD
[03:37:35] <hellyeah> hey
[03:37:49] <hellyeah> dunno it make sense i have 15 button dynam
[03:38:48] <hellyeah> dynamically created but it can be 100 or 1000 namely any amount. Can i assign different things for each button without writing condition manually http://jsfiddle.net/10r8upvu/80/
[03:39:14] <hellyeah> or doesnt it make sense?
[04:03:28] <hellyeah> hey
[04:03:56] <hellyeah> i have same id on container and button is it possible to check the equality in id http://jsfiddle.net/10r8upvu/89/
[04:04:38] <hellyeah> hey
[04:04:40] <hellyeah> ops
[04:09:07] <p2sk> hellyeah: you cant have multiple ids. use a class instead
[04:09:44] <hellyeah> multiples ids?
[04:09:50] <gurke_> yo
[04:09:52] <taplar> ids are unique to a page
[04:09:52] <gurke_> he is right
[04:09:58] <mdev> same ids gives undesirable results
[04:09:59] <hellyeah> my button and container has unique id
[04:10:32] <hellyeah> but there ids are identical
[04:10:40] <hellyeah> container has id from 1 to 14
[04:10:47] <hellyeah> button has an id from 1 to 14
[04:11:01] <mdev> sounds like you're reusing the ids
[04:11:08] <taplar> yeah, you can't do that
[04:11:10] <mdev> you can't even any ids the same, anywhere
[04:11:16] <hellyeah> taplar:  this is my last doing
[04:11:21] <mdev> if you want to group things just give them same class
[04:11:23] <hellyeah> gotcha
[04:11:45] <hellyeah> hmm class okey
[04:11:47] <hellyeah> a sec
[04:12:04] <taplar> you might try doing a data-id instead for the number
[04:13:33] <Whiskey> No one?
[04:13:56] <taplar> Whiskey: what's the question?
[04:14:03] <hellyeah> is that what you meant http://jsfiddle.net/10r8upvu/93/ ?
[04:15:23] <hellyeah> taplar:  with an id http://jsfiddle.net/10r8upvu/95/
[04:16:10] <taplar> that looks fine
[04:16:15] <hellyeah> hmm
[04:16:31] <hellyeah> okey i didnt know that one thanks for correction
[04:16:35] <taplar> ln 25 looks wrong though
[04:16:54] <hellyeah> taplar:  .append($existingTrs.clone(true, true)) ?
[04:17:09] <mdev> careful with append
[04:17:13] <mdev> it can be tricky
[04:17:16] <taplar> yeah, looks like your appending to the table, when i expect your thinking your appending to the thead
[04:17:26] <hellyeah> mdev:  what do you mean?
[04:17:54] <taplar> examples
[04:17:57] <hellyeah> taplar:  in the final step we add everything to newtable right?
[04:18:02] <taplar> X.append(A).append(B).append(C)
[04:18:08] <taplar> A B C are appended to X
[04:18:11] <mdev> I mean I tried using it to update a richtext box with new logs in a semi-realtime and it wasted hours of time because didn't work right
[04:18:22] <taplar> X.append(A).find(A).append(B).end().append(C)
[04:18:26] <mdev> so ultimately had to append another way
[04:18:36] <taplar> A and C are appended to X, B is appended to A
[04:18:39] <mdev> I read on google why it didn't work as intended but still, annoying
[04:19:04] <mdev> https://github.com/codedance/jquery.AreYouSure/issues/17
[04:19:36] <mdev> is wrong link whatever, but yeah
[04:19:52] <hellyeah> taplar:  but we add header to head right?
[04:20:04] <hellyeah> i mean "clone"
[04:20:12] <taplar> append() returns as a result the parent element
[04:20:18] <taplar> for chaining purposes
[04:20:32] <taplar> A.append(B) returns A, not B
[04:20:50] <hellyeah> i got it
[04:21:05] <hellyeah> so those lines return newtable as a result ?
[04:21:09] <taplar> yes
[04:21:35] <hellyeah> okey allow me to go through step by step
[04:22:33] <hellyeah> we appended to clone of existing trs to thead then we added to thead to newtable. Thead is child of newtable and existingtrs is child of thead. is that wrong?
[04:22:41] <taplar> no
[04:22:55] <taplar> you are not appending trs to thead
[04:23:18] <hellyeah> humm?
[04:23:25] <taplar> A.append(B) -> A
[04:23:34] <hellyeah> ('<thead/>')             .append($existingTrs.clone(true, true))
[04:23:46] <taplar> thead is not the first A
[04:24:25] <hellyeah> do i need appendTo?
[04:24:30] <taplar> no
[04:24:45] <taplar> you either need to break it up or find thead, append to it and end() first
[04:25:34] <decx> mailchimp autotranslate is the best: please confirm humanity
[04:25:41] <taplar> also while i'm looking at it, ln 11.  i don't think tableContainer is defined
[04:26:45] <hellyeah> better? http://jsfiddle.net/10r8upvu/97/
[04:27:20] <taplar> #2) use prop instead of attr
[04:27:41] <hellyeah> hmm
[04:28:05] <hellyeah> what is that?
[04:28:08] <hellyeah> ops
[04:28:17] <hellyeah> what is the reason of using prop instead of attr
[04:28:38] <taplar> prop changes the dom, attr is more about changing the markup, i believe
[04:28:47] <hellyeah> ic
[04:29:04] <hellyeah> chaged http://jsfiddle.net/10r8upvu/98/
[04:29:29] <taplar> k, da da da, why are you setting the id repeatedly in the loop?
[04:29:59] <hellyeah> in order to give dynamic id to each container.
[04:30:08] <hellyeah> i have 15 container in this case
[04:30:11] <taplar> i only see one container
[04:30:20] <hellyeah> hmm
[04:30:24] <taplar> variable that is
[04:30:36] <hellyeah> 15 variable
[04:30:43] <taplar> no....
[04:30:45] <hellyeah> hmm with different ids
[04:30:46] <taplar> line 11
[04:30:54] <taplar> you only have that created on ln 3
[04:31:02] <taplar> no where are you changing it to a different element
[04:31:30] <p2sk> and ln 11 typo
[04:31:44] <hellyeah> it is not different element but has different id i suppose i can have different element when i give different id
[04:31:46] <taplar> potentially, unless he likes that, :)
[04:31:54] <taplar> element can't have different id
[04:32:00] <taplar> your overwriting each it
[04:32:02] <taplar> each time
[04:32:06] <hellyeah> ic
[04:32:13] <hellyeah> p2sk:  typo?
[04:32:21] <taplar> 'cotainer'
[04:32:28] <p2sk> ^
[04:32:52] <hellyeah> '
[04:32:54] <hellyeah> ?
[04:33:14] <taplar> double quotes, whatever
[04:33:21] <hellyeah> okey fixed that
[04:33:23] <taplar> if you meant 'container' your missing an 'n'
[04:33:35] <hellyeah> just i didnt get used to use '
[04:33:58] <taplar> ' wasn't for the code, but emphasis on the word
[04:34:00] <taplar> for chat
[04:34:41] <taplar> but yeah, as is, you only have one container
[04:34:52] <p2sk> hellyeah: what browser do you use?
[04:35:17] <p2sk> do you use the inbuild web developer tools?
[04:35:33] <p2sk> to check what your script actually does
[04:35:54] <hellyeah> chromium
[04:36:11] <taplar> right click on the page, go to the console, and re run your script
[04:36:17] <hellyeah> taplar:  so i give id outside of div
[04:36:18] <taplar> see what the console says
[04:37:22] <hellyeah> unrecognized expression <thead/>
[04:37:33] <taplar> yup
[04:37:52] <p2sk> first your give your buttons class = "containerClass", but your click function listens on 'buttonClass'es
[04:38:07] <p2sk> its </thead>
[04:38:16] <taplar> actually just 'thead'
[04:38:20] <taplar> in this case
[04:38:30] <taplar> selector
[04:38:50] <p2sk> ahh k, thought html tag
[04:38:51] <p2sk> kk
[04:39:16] <hellyeah> ah okey
[04:39:17] <hellyeah> fixed
[04:39:18] <hellyeah> :D
[04:39:33] <hellyeah> but header is not there
[04:39:44] <taplar> now, your finding the thead and appending to it
[04:39:55] <taplar> so after the find, A is the thead, right?
[04:40:19] <hellyeah> yea
[04:40:26] <taplar> so then what happens on the .show()
[04:40:27] <hellyeah> A->B = A
[04:40:40] <hellyeah> actually nothing
[04:40:46] <hellyeah> there is no header now
[04:40:53] <taplar> no, there is
[04:40:55] <hellyeah> http://jsfiddle.net/10r8upvu/100/
[04:41:03] <taplar> but your showing the thead, when you mean to do it on the table
[04:41:23] <taplar> so before you do the show, do .end()
[04:41:29] <taplar> to terminate your previous find
[04:41:58] <hellyeah> hmm
[04:42:28] <taplar> well that didn't work.  i was pretty sure it was end().. *Searches*
[04:42:52] <hellyeah> end is executor?
[04:43:09] <hellyeah> http://jsfiddle.net/10r8upvu/101/
[04:44:39] <taplar> oh!
[04:44:41] <taplar> lol
[04:44:43] <decx> end only works if you traverse
[04:44:48] <taplar> your not adding your thead to the table anymore
[04:44:52] <decx> append isnt technically a traverse
[04:44:54] <taplar> so your finder isn't working
[04:44:55] <decx> iirc
[04:45:04] <taplar> decx: i've used it like that before
[04:45:20] <taplar> let me fiddle
[04:45:27] <decx> http://jsfiddle.net/decx/bqzv9u1r/
[04:46:59] <hellyeah> taplar:  okey
[04:47:24] <taplar> decx: http://jsfiddle.net/bqzv9u1r/1/
[04:47:41] <decx> now that's just weird
[04:47:49] <taplar> :)
[04:47:56] <taplar> it ends the last filter
[04:48:11] <decx> traversal*
[04:48:15] <taplar> *shrug*
[04:48:28] <Whiskey> $("#this > pre.toggleable.Text").html("\n" + result); is it anyway to loop result so everyline come inside <span><\span> ?
[04:48:30] <hellyeah> what will i do?
[04:48:37] <arup_r> On Ctrl + Enter I want to create line break, and on Enter to submit the comment.. While I am adding text doing Ctrl + Ent, when submitted, the text came in a single line.. how to fix it ?
[04:48:43] <arup_r> https://gist.github.com/aruprakshit/33ff9b7ab108a92d0262
[04:48:50] <taplar> hellyeah: sorry, sidetracked
[04:48:58] <taplar> you need to append your thead before you can find it
[04:49:20] <hellyeah> what does sidetracked mean btw
[04:49:39] <taplar> to have ones focus taken away
[04:49:59] <Whiskey> each maybe?
[04:50:25] <hellyeah> taplar:  http://jsfiddle.net/10r8upvu/102/
[04:50:38] <hellyeah> you
[04:50:40] <hellyeah> so
[04:50:42] <hellyeah> ops
[04:50:53] <hellyeah> you append smt and you find it to append another thing
[04:50:57] <hellyeah> is that principle?
[04:51:10] <taplar> yep, since your wanting to append to the thead and not the table
[04:51:11] <p2sk> Whiskey: with each probably https://api.jquery.com/each/
[04:51:18] <taplar> but for readability, it's probably best to break it up
[04:51:27] <decx> if you append a reference you already have the reference tho
[04:51:38] <hellyeah> break it up?
[04:51:43] <hellyeah> what do you mean?
[04:51:58] <taplar> build and append to your thead
[04:52:08] <taplar> then build your table and append your thead
[04:52:12] <taplar> don't do it all in one line
[04:52:30] <taplar> just cause you can find() and end() doesn't mean it's the best strategy
[04:52:56] <taplar> remember, small steps
[04:53:10] <hellyeah> okey
[04:53:22] <hellyeah> is there anything i need to change in my code
[04:53:48] <taplar> hold on
[04:54:21] <hellyeah> sure
[04:55:26] <taplar> http://jsfiddle.net/10r8upvu/103/
[04:56:40] <Whiskey> p2sk: i don´t understand how to use it on this $("#this > pre.toggleable.Text").html(result);
[04:57:27] <taplar> Whiskey: you realize that selector is going to give you all those elements, right?  so setting the html will set it for all to the same value
[04:58:07] <Whiskey> well i have to do it one by one
[04:58:23] <taplar> then instead of html() immediately do a .each() off of it
[04:58:45] <taplar> http://api.jquery.com/jquery.each/
[05:01:34] <Whiskey> ooo
[05:02:12] <Guest10920> i am expecting to get dialog here http://jsfiddle.net/10r8upvu/104/
[05:02:18] <Whiskey> taplar: so each(html(result))
[05:02:33] <taplar> each takes a closure with optional parameters of index and element
[05:02:42] <taplar> you do your work inside the closure
[05:02:49] <Whiskey> yeh
[05:03:55] <Whiskey> taplar: https://jsfiddle.net/5j5c4cht/
[05:04:32] <taplar> closure, look at the first example block on the api
[05:04:58] <Whiskey> yeh i have and i can´t understand how to implant it
[05:05:18] <arup_r> an hints why line breaks are not coming ?
[05:05:19] <arup_r> https://gist.github.com/aruprakshit/33ff9b7ab108a92d0262
[05:05:27] <taplar> each(function(index, value){ /* do something with the value here */ });
[05:06:51] <Whiskey> https://jsfiddle.net/5j5c4cht/1/
[05:07:04] <taplar> arup_r: you mean ln 4?
[05:07:33] <taplar> Whiskey: your finder is the outer $ before the each
[05:07:49] <taplar> the api uses $ to mean either literally the $ or the result of a selector
[05:08:00] <hellyeah> taplar:  hpw can i get spesific small tables when i click spesific button for second small table when you click second button http://jsfiddle.net/10r8upvu/105/
[05:08:59] <taplar> hellyeah: you'll have to get the number off the id.  or, as i mentioned earlier, you could store the number in a data-id field and then you could use that to get the related table
[05:09:12] <arup_r> taplar: yes
[05:09:17] <Whiskey> taplar: and that mean what?
[05:10:02] <taplar> Whiskey: hold on
[05:10:12] <Whiskey> https://jsfiddle.net/5j5c4cht/2/
[05:10:33] <hellyeah> id of table?
[05:11:26] <taplar> Whiskey: https://jsfiddle.net/5j5c4cht/4/
[05:12:07] <taplar> arup_r: have you did a console log to make sure you going in that if conditional?
[05:12:21] <taplar> hellyeah: let me put something on your fiddle
[05:12:39] <hellyeah> sure
[05:12:41] <hellyeah> thanks
[05:13:56] <arup_r> taplar: If it goes to the if clause it would submit it.. When I will press Ctrl + Enter, it shouldn't submit, it will create a new line, and allow users to put there lines.. and it is happening. But when my edit is done, and hit enter, it is getting submitted. and I see all texts in the same line
[05:14:18] <taplar> hellyeah: http://jsfiddle.net/10r8upvu/108/
[05:15:46] <taplar> arup_r: are there any like \n's?
[05:16:02] <hellyeah> taplar:  i suppopsed you said different element cannot have same ids
[05:16:06] <arup_r> I tried `\n` .. it didn't work
[05:16:11] <taplar> bah, your doing <br>, nvm
[05:16:11] <arup_r> same ..
[05:16:21] <Whiskey> console.log show me nothing
[05:16:42] <taplar> hellyeah: an id is unique to a page.  it's an identifier.  if it goes to multiple things, it doesn't really identify now does it?
[05:17:20] <taplar> Whiskey: check your ajax result, make sure your getting a 200
[05:17:24] <taplar> and not an error
[05:17:48] <hellyeah> but
[05:17:52] <hellyeah> one of them is div
[05:17:57] <hellyeah> other is button
[05:18:05] <taplar> hellyeah: doesn't matter
[05:18:07] <hellyeah> so they are different
[05:18:10] <taplar> no
[05:18:14] <taplar> id is page scope
[05:18:16] <hellyeah> hmm
[05:18:17] <taplar> dom scope
[05:18:27] <hellyeah> humm
[05:18:31] <hellyeah> if you give same id
[05:18:38] <hellyeah> it appears in same dom scope
[05:18:46] <hellyeah> ?
[05:18:55] <taplar> if you do same id, selectors will either return you just the first one or the last one, i forget which
[05:19:07] <hellyeah> gotcha
[05:19:44] <taplar> using data elements lets you get around that
[05:19:51] <taplar> they are not bound by uniqueness
[05:20:03] <hellyeah> so button1, button2, button3... as id container1, container2, container3 as id?
[05:20:18] <hellyeah> hmm data-id
[05:20:26] <hellyeah> hmm
[05:20:29] <hellyeah> data-id
[05:20:30] <hellyeah> ops
[05:20:34] <taplar> hold on, let me show you a small demo
[05:20:48] <Whiskey> taplar: get invalid 'in' operand obj
[05:20:50] <hellyeah> data-id instead of id
[05:20:56] <hellyeah> you can give same things there
[05:20:57] <hellyeah> right
[05:21:11] <hellyeah> i became stupid little bit at this moment
[05:22:02] <p2sk> Whiskey: code?
[05:23:35] <Whiskey> well
[05:23:35] <Whiskey> callback.apply is not a function
[05:23:42] <Whiskey> https://jsfiddle.net/5j5c4cht/6/
[05:24:51] <taplar> hellyeah: http://jsfiddle.net/oL46g6n1/
[05:24:56] <decx> you're mixing up .each and $.each
[05:25:23] <Herehere> I have select2 dropdown with input. How can I set values in there?
[05:25:52] <hellyeah> taplar:  can i give data-id like that http://jsfiddle.net/10r8upvu/109/
[05:26:08] <p2sk> Whiskey: what do you want to achive?
[05:26:26] <taplar> hellyeah: you can put a data element directly on an element like I did with the example, or you can add it dynamicall with data(key, value)
[05:26:34] <Whiskey> want it to loop line by line from the result of get, and add span to every line
[05:26:45] <p2sk> *achieve
[05:26:46] <taplar> if you use the dynamic data() function though, leave off the data- part of the key, it will add that for you
[05:26:56] <Whiskey> $("#nfo0 > pre.toggleable.Text").html("<span>" +result + "</span>")	 <-- like that
[05:27:13] <hellyeah> taplar:  ic
[05:27:17] <p2sk> okay, what is your result?
[05:27:21] <p2sk> from the get
[05:27:30] <p2sk> the link in your fiddle? that *yml
[05:28:08] <Whiskey> https://jsfiddle.net/5j5c4cht/7/
[05:28:11] <taplar> gotta afk for a while
[05:29:24] <Whiskey> can´t be hard to get span on every line when it print out the content from the url
[05:30:04] <p2sk> Whiskey: you have to read your file line by line and than loop over every line to wrap it with a span tag
[05:30:16] <Whiskey> yeh thats what i try to do
[05:30:27] <Whiskey> https://jsfiddle.net/5j5c4cht/6/ <-- whit that
[05:31:12] <abailarri> Hello. I have a string with this value: /cat/nor-gara, and I want to get like this /nor-gara. In jquery, what is the best way?
[05:31:41] <jonah> Hi sorry to bother everyone. I have used a nice little lightbox on this page: http://www.yorkmodelmaking.com/newsite/index.php?id=8
[05:31:46] <abailarri> the /cat/ may be different, for example /eus/ or /fi/ ro anoteher
[05:31:54] <jonah> It works great, but the user has to click 'view' to get the image to popup
[05:32:07] <p2sk> Whiskey: give me a sec
[05:32:14] <jonah> before it had onClick="self.location='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Search?go=Go&search=+thumbnail'" in the mask code
[05:32:34] <jonah> but for some reason this made the image open in the browser, not popup in the lightbox so I had to remove it...
[05:32:43] <jonah> does anyone please know how I could get it to work?
[05:33:41] <jonah> *sorry I meant onClick="self.location='linktopicgoes here'"

[05:44:11] <Whiskey> ut supose to come as the output from the orginal, well maybe that won´t be a problem
[05:44:21] <p2sk> no you want for each line an span tag
[05:44:25] <p2sk> check the html
[05:44:30] <Whiskey> well
[05:44:31] <Whiskey> container.append("<span>"+value+"</span>"+"\n"); thanks
[05:44:44] <p2sk> no
[05:45:02] <p2sk> "\n" isnt a html line break
[05:45:10] <p2sk> <br>
[05:45:15] <p2sk> is
[05:45:52] <p2sk> and span is an inline tag, so thats why it looks "unstyled" like its in one row
[05:46:10] <p2sk> style it or use <p> tag

[05:52:30] <hellyeah> hey
[05:53:58] <hellyeah> using filter function instead of x
[05:54:04] <hellyeah> better?
[05:57:42] <Whiskey> How do you empty an element?
[05:57:52] <Whiskey> empty is one way, but it also remove it and not just empty whats inside it?
[05:58:09] <taplar> you mean remove children?
[05:58:36] <Whiskey> https://jsfiddle.net/5j5c4cht/11/ <-- like there how to remove the test before append the new data?
[05:59:18] <taplar> Whiskey: you can remove by either doing html('') or children().remove()
[05:59:23] <Whiskey> well remove whats inside pre-tag and not the pre-tag
[06:00:31] <taplar> in your case use html('')
[06:00:32] <Whiskey> html won´t work
[06:00:43] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/5j5c4cht/12/
[06:01:05] <Whiskey> aaaa you think like that
[06:01:11] <taplar> ?
[06:01:42] <Whiskey> thanks alot :)
[06:08:27] <hellyeah> does it seem correct http://jsfiddle.net/10r8upvu/111/
[06:09:09] <taplar> you still only have one conatiner
[06:09:27] <hellyeah> hmm
[06:09:32] <taplar> and use data('id' not prop('data-id'
[06:12:16] <hellyeah> taplar:  http://jsfiddle.net/10r8upvu/112/
[06:14:18] <taplar> just store your number in your data id
[06:14:37] <hellyeah> ops
[06:14:49] <taplar> and then work on creating multiple containers
[06:16:14] <hellyeah> taplar:  i am sorry it is correct now http://jsfiddle.net/10r8upvu/113/ ?
[06:16:41] <taplar> you still only have one container
[06:16:46] <taplar> why do you think there are multiples?
[06:18:10] <hellyeah> well
[06:18:38] <hellyeah> i chunked table into parts
[06:18:46] <hellyeah> and i cloned table into container
[06:18:52] <hellyeah> i have 15 buttons right now
[06:19:03] <hellyeah> when i click button i will get related container
[06:19:13] <hellyeah> i thought like i have 15 container on the dom
[06:19:17] <taplar> why?
[06:19:28] <hellyeah> i remembered you said it is overwritten
[06:19:47] <taplar> the value is over written
[06:20:01] <hellyeah> so i just have oe container right?
[06:20:05] <hellyeah> one*
[06:20:11] <taplar> lol, been saying that for a while
[06:20:18] <hellyeah> yea
[06:20:22] <hellyeah> i know
[06:20:28] <hellyeah> sorry
[06:20:33] <hellyeah> that was like a question
[06:20:41] <hellyeah> i remembered when you said that
[06:20:53] <taplar> unless you create something, you have nothing.  unless you create duplicates, you only have one
[06:20:59] <hellyeah> but i dont know how to create multiple div and put table to each
[06:21:17] <taplar> your creating tables
[06:21:20] <taplar> and theads
[06:21:21] <taplar> and ths
[06:21:28] <taplar> why can't you create a container?
[06:21:40] <hellyeah> well
[06:21:46] <hellyeah> i mean
[06:21:51] <hellyeah> i am just newbie
[06:21:55] <hellyeah> i need to have dialog
[06:21:59] <hellyeah> modal window
[06:22:06] <taplar> you need to have pseudocode, :P
[06:22:16] <hellyeah> when i saw examples that creates a div
[06:22:39] <hellyeah> $("#container").dialog();
[06:22:48] <taplar> take a moment and get a piece of paper or notepad or something
[06:23:02] <hellyeah> i didnt reject psuedo code :D
[06:23:02] <taplar> write out in english, or your native language, step by step what you want to happen
[06:23:14] <taplar> then write the javascript to make that happen
[06:24:04] <hellyeah> taplar:  i have 15 small tables right that has 10 rows are we agree?
[06:24:13] <taplar> don't tell me, tell yourself
[06:24:16] <taplar> write it out
[06:24:26] <taplar> work the logic
[06:24:56] <taplar> very important skill to have
[06:25:32] <taplar> once you have the logic down, making a language do the logic is just implementation
[06:26:14] <hellyeah> ti have the logic actually
[06:26:23] <hellyeah> my code didnt implement my logic
[06:26:30] <hellyeah> let me try to write it down
[06:26:33] <hellyeah> just a sec
[06:30:33] <hellyeah> taplar:  is it understandable? http://dpaste.com/2CXGPJK
[06:30:49] <hellyeah> can you take a look?
[06:30:51] <taplar> that's not pseudocode
[06:30:55] <taplar> hold on
[06:31:07] <hellyeah> ops
[06:31:13] <hellyeah> you expect psuedo code sorry
[06:31:21] <taplar> logically state what you want to happen
[06:31:58] <hellyeah> i try but with sentence
[06:34:00] <taplar> http://jsfiddle.net/f0pxmkvn/
[06:34:33] <taplar> step by step, logically stating what you want to happen
[06:36:08] <taplar> then once you have it worked out, it just becomes a question of, how to do a loop in javascript?  how do i create the elements?  implementation details, but you have your logic down so once you have it implemented you know it will work
[06:37:31] <hellyeah> taplar:  http://jsfiddle.net/f0pxmkvn/1/
[06:37:50] <hellyeah> but my english is not as good as your english
[06:38:22] <taplar> work the creation of tables first before working the button problem
[06:38:24] <taplar> small steps
[06:38:48] <taplar> logically, when do you create a new table
[06:38:49] <Guest60> can someone tell me why "$('.alert-danger').show().delay(2800).hide();" does not work?
[06:39:02] <taplar> when do you know your done with it and need to create a new one
[06:39:06] <taplar> when do you add it to the body?
[06:39:08] <Guest60> So the alert-danger isnt showed up. If i only use show() it works :)
[06:40:42] <taplar> Guest60: does it give an error in the console?
[06:42:54] <Guest60> taplar: no .. it just skip this line. This is my code: http://laravel.io/bin/vB5Bq
[06:42:57] <hellyeah> taplar:  http://jsfiddle.net/f0pxmkvn/2/
[06:44:09] <taplar> hellyeah: state your steps in relation to the logical operations
[06:44:24] <taplar> look how i did the LOOP and IF and such
[06:44:39] <taplar> it tells me what operations i am doing
[06:45:08] <taplar> one step at a time, not i do a bunch of things
[06:45:16] <taplar> i do this one thing, then i do this other one thing, and then...
[06:45:53] <hellyeah> well you create table and you add row to table there
[06:46:14] <taplar> that's a many step sentence
[06:46:28] <taplar> that cannot be done in just one operation
[06:46:41] <taplar> how would you do that, one thing at a time
[06:46:52] <hellyeah> with code?
[06:46:59] <taplar> pseudocode
[06:47:27] <taplar> "i create new table after getting the amount of row into new table."
[06:47:42] <taplar> GET existingRows
[06:47:47] <taplar> CREATE newTable
[06:47:50] <hellyeah> okey
[06:47:53] <hellyeah> i got it
[06:47:54] <hellyeah> sorry
[06:48:00] <hellyeah> i am not good at psuedo code
[06:48:04] <hellyeah> just a sec
[06:48:12] <taplar> i'm gonna pound it into your head, :D
[06:48:43] <hellyeah> :D:D:D
[06:48:57] <hellyeah> btw
[06:48:58] <hellyeah> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WIKqgE4BwAY
[06:50:20] <hellyeah> is it okey now http://jsfiddle.net/f0pxmkvn/3/
[06:50:43] <taplar> Guest60: not sure why that is not working
[06:51:11] <taplar> hellyeah: use tabs to signify logical nesting
[06:51:22] <taplar> or spacing, whatever flavor you like
[06:51:57] <taplar> "clone rows on the body to table."
[06:52:05] <taplar> many step statement
[06:52:15] <taplar> step by step, how would you do that
[06:52:17] <taplar> which rows?
[06:54:14] <hellyeah> taplar:  http://jsfiddle.net/f0pxmkvn/4/
[06:54:27] <hellyeah> humm
[06:54:37] <hellyeah> row in the body
[06:54:55] <hellyeah> is it oke now
[06:55:44] <taplar> look at that structure
[06:55:56] <taplar> the loop is looping over each row one at a time
[06:56:03] <Herehere> guys, why else statement is not working? https://dpaste.de/Mjcn
[06:56:32] <taplar> Herehere: console log your value and see what it is
[06:56:37] <hellyeah> ic
[06:56:49] <hellyeah> just this has to be add once
[06:56:53] <hellyeah> added*
[06:57:05] <taplar> what is 'this'?
[06:57:21] <hellyeah> what
[06:57:27] <hellyeah> :d
[06:57:46] <taplar> what has to be added once?
[06:58:28] <hellyeah> i dont know but
[06:58:42] <taplar> lol, well if you don't know how can your code?
[06:58:54] <hellyeah> i know
[06:58:58] <hellyeah> i amconfused
[06:59:00] <hellyeah> $container.append($temparray.clone(true));
[06:59:02] <taplar> hold on
[06:59:05] <hellyeah> this line handles
[06:59:22] <hellyeah> just copy each part to new table
[07:00:14] <p2sk> Herehere: missing ; after doXHR()
[07:00:52] <taplar> hellyeah: http://jsfiddle.net/f0pxmkvn/5/
[07:01:06] <Crendal> helo
[07:01:22] <taplar> so that right there would add all the rows to the newTable that is created
[07:01:26] <Crendal> which event do i have have to wait for before i can access offsetWidth of an element ?
[07:01:30] <Crendal> which event do i have have to wait for before i can access offsetWidth of an element ?
[07:01:30] <p2sk> and probably $('.task_input').text() is always 'All' ;)
[07:01:34] <Herehere> p2sk: wtf rly?
[07:01:35] <taplar> make a conditional for creating a new one
[07:01:39] <Crendal> whoops
[07:02:03] <Crendal> i tried "ready" but that was to early
[07:02:13] <p2sk> Herehere: on your snipped you linked, yes
[07:02:16] <Herehere> p2sk: The if statment works fine, but what is inside else is not working
[07:03:01] <p2sk> what is select2?
[07:03:35] <Herehere> p2sk: its a jquery plugin
[07:03:59] <hellyeah> yes
[07:03:59] <p2sk> is .employee_input a select element?
[07:04:06] <hellyeah> thats what i did
[07:04:07] <Herehere> yes
[07:04:10] <hellyeah> right?
[07:04:28] <kegster> If I have a button or link that I want to open in a new window and then refresh the original window-- what is the best way to do this?
[07:04:31] <Herehere> I know that select 2 is wokring because this works:                 $(".employee_input ").select2('val', json.employees);
[07:05:09] <Guest60> My ajax returns "{"email":["The email field is required."],".  How can i fetch my text? data.responseText.email gives no response
[07:05:37] <Guest60> if i use data.responseText it returns ""{"email":["The email field is required."]".
[07:06:02] <p2sk> Herehere: does the second argument on the select2 function wants json?
[07:06:12] <p2sk> because [''] isnt valid json
[07:06:47] <Herehere> p2sk: everything is correct, it works as suppose to
[07:07:01] <Herehere> so my code is fine right?
[07:07:29] <Herehere> this code https://dpaste.de/Mjcn
[07:08:10] <p2sk> when everything does as expected then yes
[07:08:53] <Herehere> p2sk: its not working, but is the code I just pasted is correct
[07:09:14] <taplar> hellyeah: you see my last statement?
[07:09:40] <hellyeah> i checked last jsfiddle
[07:09:59] <p2sk> when your code doesn't work, then your code isnt correct ~.~
[07:10:53] <taplar> hellyeah: add statements that will create a new table once your existing new table has the desired number of max rows
[07:11:35] <p2sk> Herehere: pls post a working example
[07:12:34] <Herehere> p2sk: Ech, cant do that, anyway thanks for help :P
[07:13:15] <p2sk> ..
[07:13:18] <hellyeah> taplar:  i assumed when you create table inside for loop it will create table in each step of loop is it false?
[07:13:34] <taplar> only if it does not exist, as the pseudocode says
[07:14:17] <norc> Hi. Given a node, I want to traverse each next sibling. Is there some jquery way to do this?
[07:14:27] <taplar> norc: .next()
[07:14:37] <Crendal> anyone ?
[07:14:57] <norc> taplar: I see. So I just call next() until I get an undefined back?
[07:15:11] <taplar> norc: believe that is the case
[07:15:21] <hellyeah> i think
[07:15:25] <hellyeah> when for loop ends
[07:15:28] <taplar> or just do .siblings().each()
[07:15:32] <hellyeah> i must create a table
[07:15:32] <norc> taplar: nextAll() seems to do the trick.
[07:15:40] <norc> taplar: That would include the previous siblings.
[07:15:48] <taplar> yeah, :)
[07:16:11] <taplar> hellyeah: when the loop ends you've traversed all your trs
[07:16:27] <taplar> looping all the rows
[07:16:32] <taplar> if we don't have a table, we create one
[07:16:37] <taplar> then we add the row to our table
[07:16:43] <hellyeah> yes
[07:16:46] <taplar> when do we know that the table is done?
[07:16:58] <hellyeah> when for loop ends
[07:17:01] <taplar> no
[07:17:07] <taplar> when it ends all rows have been moved over
[07:17:13] <taplar> you want smaller sub set tables
[07:17:18] <taplar> when do you know that the table is done?
[07:17:36] <hellyeah> when all rows have been moved over
[07:17:45] <taplar> i thought you wanted many smaller tables?
[07:17:54] <hellyeah> yes
[07:18:07] <taplar> those two statements do not go together
[07:18:09] <taplar> all moved over
[07:18:12] <taplar> small subsets
[07:18:19] <hellyeah> okey
[07:18:31] <hellyeah> the amount of row i stated in the for loop moved over
[07:18:38] <hellyeah> 10 rows each time
[07:18:42] <taplar> ok
[07:18:51] <taplar> so once the table ....... then we know we're done
[07:18:54] <taplar> fill in the .....
[07:19:35] <hellyeah> full?
[07:19:40] <hellyeah> ops
[07:19:42] <taplar> define full
[07:19:43] <hellyeah> damn
[07:20:00] <taplar> logically, how do i know it is full
[07:20:27] <hellyeah> table cannot be full
[07:20:33] <taplar> -_-, yes it can
[07:20:38] <hellyeah> hmm
[07:20:49] <taplar> i have a bucket, it can hold 10 gallons
[07:20:54] <taplar> how do i know when it is full?
[07:21:10] <hellyeah> when it exceed the limit of bucket
[07:21:17] <taplar> not before?
[07:21:21] <hellyeah> when you see 10 gallons on buckety
[07:21:24] <hellyeah> when you see 10 gallons on bucket
[07:21:25] <taplar> ok
[07:21:26] <taplar> so
[07:21:32] <hellyeah> is it correct?
[07:21:39] <taplar> i have a table, i want it to have 10 rows in it.  how do i know when it is full?
[07:21:54] <hellyeah> when table has 10 rows you will know
[07:22:01] <taplar> alright, add that to the fiddle
[07:22:07] <hellyeah> when you add 10 rows you will know
[07:23:40] <hellyeah> http://jsfiddle.net/f0pxmkvn/6/
[07:23:56] <p2sk> taplar: hopefully you get paid for teaching ;)
[07:23:59] <taplar> that's ourside the loop
[07:24:02] <taplar> p2sk: lmao
[07:24:28] <taplar> he's been working on this for atleast a week.  i'm going to pound it into his head, heh
[07:24:52] <taplar> the lightbulb will come on!
[07:25:08] <p2sk> may the force be with you :)
[07:25:08] <hellyeah> ourside
[07:25:15] <taplar> sorry
[07:25:16] <taplar> outside
[07:25:20] <hellyeah> :D
[07:25:36] <taplar> if you want subsets, you'll want to check in the loop
[07:25:53] <hellyeah> table exist or not?
[07:26:14] <taplar> the IF ensures that the table exists already once you get after it
[07:26:21] <taplar> so assuming the table now exists
[07:26:30] <taplar> and we just added at least one row to it
[07:26:36] <taplar> check if it is full
[07:26:44] <hellyeah> if it is full
[07:26:49] <hellyeah> create a new one
[07:26:52] <taplar> no
[07:26:54] <taplar> just the check
[07:27:01] <taplar> add the statement that will do the check
[07:27:49] <hellyeah> http://jsfiddle.net/f0pxmkvn/7/
[07:28:04] <taplar> that's still outside the loop
[07:29:00] <taplar> and your not stating how you know it is full
[07:29:01] <hellyeah> sorry http://jsfiddle.net/f0pxmkvn/8/
[07:29:26] <taplar> yep, but 'is full' isn't clear
[07:29:32] <taplar> how do you know it is full
[07:29:44] <taplar> you said it up above
[07:30:17] <hellyeah> http://jsfiddle.net/f0pxmkvn/9/
[07:30:37] <taplar> lol, no, make the statement tel you
[07:30:46] <taplar> IF newTable ....
[07:31:02] <hellyeah> if newTable has rows
[07:31:04] <hellyeah> if newTable has row
[07:31:11] <taplar> that would be true once it has 1 row
[07:31:13] <hellyeah> create new table
[07:31:48] <hellyeah> so just a sec
[07:31:54] <hellyeah> for making this clear
[07:32:00] <hellyeah> and refreshing mind little bit
[07:32:17] <hellyeah> we create table just one when there is no table
[07:32:24] <hellyeah> this will work just one time
[07:32:25] <taplar> for now
[07:32:28] <hellyeah> okey
[07:32:36] <taplar> working up to it
[07:32:47] <hellyeah> and then we will create new table because we are gonna make sure there is always table full
[07:32:56] <taplar> fix your if first
[07:32:58] <hellyeah> am i correct?
[07:33:08] <hellyeah> http://jsfiddle.net/f0pxmkvn/11/
[07:33:44] <taplar> http://jsfiddle.net/f0pxmkvn/12/
[07:35:07] <hellyeah> http://jsfiddle.net/f0pxmkvn/13/
[07:35:29] <taplar> so your going to limit each table to one row
[07:36:13] <hellyeah> at least one row
[07:36:27] <hellyeah> so table.length != 0
[07:36:27] <taplar> ....
[07:36:45] <taplar> the conditional your writing it so know your done with the current new table so you can create another one
[07:37:00] <taplar> when is it done
[07:37:20] <hellyeah> i am stupid
[07:37:35] <hellyeah> i want 10 rows
[07:37:43] <taplar> make that conditional say that
[07:37:45] <hellyeah> my for loop execute 10 times
[07:38:00] <taplar> no
[07:38:04] <p2sk> its getting warm ;)
[07:38:10] <taplar> your for look executes how ever many rows are in the original table
[07:38:14] <taplar> look = loop
[07:38:15] <hellyeah> :D
[07:38:17] <hellyeah> http://jsfiddle.net/f0pxmkvn/14/
[07:38:29] <taplar> yay
[07:38:29] <taplar> !
[07:38:30] <p2sk> weee
[07:38:38] <taplar> now
[07:38:41] <taplar> you got a table
[07:38:42] <hellyeah> zuahahahaha
[07:38:46] <taplar> it now has 10 rows
[07:38:49] <taplar> what do you do now
[07:39:07] <hellyeah> create newtables
[07:39:11] <hellyeah> and add header
[07:39:14] <taplar> what about your old table?
[07:39:18] <taplar> that you just made
[07:39:33] <hellyeah> hmm
[07:39:42] <hellyeah> i created table once
[07:39:52] <hellyeah> so i should add it to the DOM
[07:39:57] <taplar> do it!
[07:40:43] <hellyeah> http://jsfiddle.net/f0pxmkvn/15/
[07:41:07] <hellyeah> is that wrong_
[07:41:19] <taplar> close http://jsfiddle.net/f0pxmkvn/16/
[07:41:30] <hellyeah> at least i was close
[07:41:31] <hellyeah> :D
[07:41:33] <taplar> yep
[07:41:36] <taplar> ok
[07:41:47] <taplar> you've created a table, added 10 rows to it, added it to the dom.  now what
[07:42:16] <hellyeah> create another table
[07:42:24] <taplar> when do we create tables?
[07:42:34] <hellyeah> if it does not exist
[07:42:37] <taplar> and do you need to?
[07:42:43] <taplar> maybe it's the last row
[07:42:50] <hellyeah> hmm
[07:42:59] <hellyeah> my big table has 144 rows
[07:43:00] <taplar> but yes, we create one if one does not exist
[07:43:11] <hellyeah> we just created one table with 10 rows
[07:43:17] <hellyeah> we need to create 14 more
[07:43:20] <taplar> but our variable has the old table in it
[07:43:29] <taplar> how can we make it 'not exist' anymore?
[07:43:40] <hellyeah> sorry we cant
[07:43:45] <taplar> it's a variable
[07:43:46] <hellyeah> yes you are right
[07:44:24] <hellyeah> we need to create seperate tables right?
[07:44:29] <taplar> yep
[07:45:12] <taplar> if we have another row, the loop will go again.  we want that first if to be true so it will create another table
[07:45:32] <hellyeah> well we can append tabe to the tail of newTable but this is not the solution
[07:45:56] <hellyeah> taplar:  can you give me little clue??
[07:46:01] <taplar> i did
[07:46:09] <taplar> how do you make that first IF true again
[07:46:22] <hellyeah> newTable exist
[07:46:28] <taplar> newTable is a variable
[07:46:33] <taplar> not the actual element
[07:46:39] <taplar> you added that to the dom
[07:46:52] <hellyeah> humm
[07:46:54] <taplar> newTable still references it, but that can change
[07:46:56] <hellyeah> ah
[07:47:03] <hellyeah> we make if not exist true
[07:47:04] <hellyeah> right
[07:47:18] <hellyeah> wipe the variable?
[07:47:24] <taplar> go for it
[07:47:30] <hellyeah> newtable?null
[07:47:31] <hellyeah> newtable = null
[07:47:33] <taplar> yep
[07:47:41] <taplar> SET newTable TO null
[07:48:56] <newbie> taplar:
[07:48:57] <newbie> sorry
[07:49:05] <newbie> http://jsfiddle.net/f0pxmkvn/19/
[07:49:16] <Guest13781> but it doesnt make variable "not exist"
[07:49:30] <taplar> do you want it outside the if?
[07:49:33] <taplar> that would happen every time
[07:49:51] <hellyeah> you are right
[07:49:57] <hellyeah> it happens everytime
[07:50:05] <hellyeah> so we wont have anything
[07:50:12] <hellyeah> because in order to add to dom
[07:50:19] <hellyeah> we should have table with 10 rows
[07:50:21] <taplar> you'll create a table every time, and never add it to the body
[07:50:26] <hellyeah> in this case we dont have tat
[07:50:33] <taplar> you only want to do that when.....
[07:50:34] <hellyeah> yes we wont have any table
[07:50:42] <hellyeah> second if is true
[07:50:49] <taplar> and.....
[07:51:02] <hellyeah> http://jsfiddle.net/f0pxmkvn/20/
[07:51:08] <hellyeah> hmm
[07:51:14] <taplar> there ya go
[07:51:26] <hellyeah> yes
[07:51:29] <taplar> alright, run through it
[07:51:33] <hellyeah> we create seperate table
[07:51:38] <hellyeah> and we add to dom
[07:51:38] <taplar> if your original table has 20 rows, what will happen
[07:51:56] <hellyeah> we will have two tables they have 10 rows
[07:52:09] <taplar> what if the original table has 24 rows?
[07:52:30] <hellyeah> it must be 10 | 10 | 4
[07:52:35] <taplar> but will it
[07:52:41] <hellyeah> no
[07:52:44] <taplar> why not
[07:52:50] <hellyeah> because w dont have condition for that
[07:52:57] <taplar> alright, so what do we do about that?
[07:53:24] <mustmodify> Hey, can any jQuery gurus help me make something awesome? I want to take the wait_for_modal_to_be_drawn_then method here and turn it into a .then() method after modal('show') ... I think it should be relatively easy. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11380392/the-focus-method-in-jquery-doesnt-work/31749089#31749089
[07:53:50] <hellyeah> taplar:  can you give me cluie?
[07:54:04] <taplar> hint: your loop has terminated in that case
[07:54:30] <taplar> you now may or may not have a table
[07:54:37] <taplar> if you do, you want to do something
[07:57:44] <hellyeah> honestly nothing in my mind
[07:58:12] <taplar> so say it again, what's the problem now?
[07:58:23] <hellyeah> we want 10 rows
[07:58:25] <hellyeah> but
[07:58:40] <hellyeah> and we check for 10 rows we assume when table has 10 rows
[07:58:56] <hellyeah> but we can not react that condition
[07:59:14] <hellyeah> in this case we have to create a table has less then 10 rows
[07:59:24] <taplar> how do we know when we have that problem?
[07:59:35] <hellyeah> well
[07:59:39] <taplar> and lets state it differently
[07:59:55] <taplar> we have a problem when a table with less that 10 rows was not added to the body
[07:59:56] <hellyeah> if(element.length % 10 != 0)
[08:00:16] <hellyeah> ops
[08:00:24] <hellyeah> if(element.length % 10 === 0)
[08:00:34] <hellyeah> hmm i am confused about modulo
[08:00:39] <taplar> no don't think about the elements
[08:00:43] <taplar> think about what you have
[08:00:52] <taplar> you have a table that was not added to the body
[08:00:52] <hellyeah> okey
[08:01:28] <taplar> so to fix that you need to....
[08:01:50] <hellyeah> newTable.length i would say but newTable is null
[08:01:55] <taplar> no
[08:02:03] <hellyeah> no?
[08:02:04] <taplar> it's only null if it was added to the body
[08:02:24] <hellyeah> yes sorry
[08:02:33] <hellyeah> newTable.length <= 10
[08:02:41] <taplar> does length matter?
[08:03:11] <hellyeah> humm
[08:03:25] <taplar> you either have a table, or you don't
[08:03:26] <taplar> right?
[08:03:31] <hellyeah> yes
[08:03:58] <hellyeah> we reach end of for loop
[08:04:05] <hellyeah> and we have table
[08:04:09] <hellyeah> we dont reach ten
[08:04:25] <hellyeah> can i say
[08:04:35] <hellyeah> i==== end
[08:04:38] <taplar> no
[08:04:55] <taplar> don't check the end of the loop
[08:05:01] <taplar> just put your code after it ends
[08:06:03] <taplar> here, let me make a small change
[08:06:12] <hellyeah> sure thanks
[08:06:53] <taplar_> sorry, got disconnected
[08:06:55] <taplar_> http://jsfiddle.net/f0pxmkvn/22/
[08:06:58] <hellyeah> nope
[08:07:11] <taplar_> newTable is set to null outside, so the variable exists outside the loop
[08:08:01] <taplar> so what is the problem, how do you check for it, and what do you do when it is encountered?
[08:08:22] <hellyeah> variable exist if "if" case is not true
[08:08:33] <hellyeah> and also it exist outside for loop
[08:08:36] <hellyeah> sso
[08:08:39] <hellyeah> the only thing
[08:08:41] <hellyeah> need to do
[08:08:44] <taplar> null is considered as not existing
[08:08:47] <hellyeah> add to body outside the loop
[08:08:53] <taplar> yep
[08:09:14] <hellyeah> and set it to null
[08:09:18] <hellyeah> is it necessary?
[08:09:22] <taplar> not
[08:09:37] <hellyeah> okey
[08:09:46] <hellyeah> null is considered as not existing
[08:09:52] <hellyeah> is it spesific to javascript
[08:10:03] <taplar> nope, that's typical of most languages i've encountered
[08:10:04] <hellyeah> because in java, c# it is not like that i guess
[08:10:09] <hellyeah> hmm
[08:10:14] <hellyeah> ic
[08:10:27] <hellyeah> so we created seperate tables
[08:11:08] <hellyeah> taplar:  this question can help http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8495687/split-array-into-chunks
[08:11:21] <taplar> don't need that
[08:11:26] <taplar> your almost done with this problem
[08:12:24] <taplar> you just need to handle your edge case
[08:12:49] <taplar> though it's really not an edge case as the chances of having an uneven number of rows is probably high
[08:13:15] <taplar> so back to it
[08:13:21] <taplar> after the loop, you may or may not have a table
[08:15:14] <daynaskully> {Q} is it possible to "refresh" a particular element in the dom so it can have access to a data-equalizer js function? (basically i'm loading in elements via ajax and the equalizer doesnt fire on the new ones pulled in)
[08:15:49] <taplar> daynaskully: new elements would not have the function bound to them
[08:15:57] <taplar> you'd just need to do to them what you did to the others
[08:16:10] <hellyeah> taplar:
[08:16:15] <hellyeah> what is that edge cases
[08:16:27] <hellyeah> probably i will have some spesific big number row
[08:16:30] <hellyeah> can be 1000
[08:16:30] <taplar> a table that was not appended to the body in the for loop
[08:16:45] <hellyeah> we added it to outside of for loop
[08:16:46] <taplar> shouldn't say for loop, just some loop
[08:16:52] <taplar> you did?
[08:16:55] <taplar> i didn't see that
[08:16:59] <hellyeah> http://jsfiddle.net/f0pxmkvn/23/
[08:17:08] <taplar> ok
[08:17:09] <hellyeah> sorry forgot to give you
[08:17:13] <taplar> will that always work?
[08:17:59] <taplar> what if there were 20 rows
[08:18:01] <hellyeah> humm
[08:18:05] <hellyeah> okey
[08:18:08] <hellyeah> well
[08:18:15] <hellyeah> check if newtable exit
[08:18:17] <hellyeah> exist
[08:18:18] <taplar> ;)
[08:18:44] <hellyeah> http://jsfiddle.net/f0pxmkvn/24/
[08:18:45] <hellyeah> :D
[08:19:02] <hellyeah> sorry i am in front of computer almost 10 hours
[08:19:13] <hellyeah> i get my second wind right now
[08:19:23] <hellyeah> not so effective tho
[08:19:25] <taplar> http://jsfiddle.net/f0pxmkvn/25/  just a little formatting change
[08:19:30] <taplar> but yep
[08:19:41] <hellyeah> wow
[08:19:46] <hellyeah> i am good using idioms
[08:19:46] <hellyeah> :D
[08:19:52] <taplar> there ya go.  you now have an example of a pseudocode version of a problem solution
[08:20:23] <taplar> now you get to implement it in javascript, :)
[08:20:24] <hellyeah> but my for loop must be little tricky tho
[08:20:44] <hellyeah> because i starts from 0 and go to 10
[08:21:05] <hellyeah> when it is done i must start with 11 and go  go to 20
[08:21:09] <hellyeah> 21 to 30 etc.
[08:21:12] <hellyeah> right
[08:21:23] <taplar> no, length of your new table will start at zero and go up
[08:21:46] <hellyeah> but
[08:21:53] <hellyeah> my original table has a rows
[08:22:02] <hellyeah> i need to get it from different position
[08:22:04] <hellyeah> right
[08:22:11] <taplar> why is that a problem?
[08:22:22] <hellyeah> no this is not a problem
[08:22:29] <hellyeah> i just try to make sure
[08:22:30] <hellyeah> :D
[08:22:43] <taplar> your looping over the rows from the original table
[08:22:46] <taplar> your never going backwards
[08:23:19] <hellyeah> yes
[08:23:38] <hellyeah> i must start from the end in the next loop i guess
[08:23:44] <hellyeah> 10 10 10 10 10
[08:23:46] <taplar> huh?
[08:24:04] <hellyeah> anyway
[08:24:14] <hellyeah> i need to smoke cigarettes
[08:24:36] <taplar> k, i'm going to be afk for a while.  need to do some work in the shop and bug some people
[08:24:38] <hellyeah> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8495687/split-array-into-chunks do you think loop like that is necessary? first answer
[08:24:49] <hellyeah> bug some people
[08:24:53] <hellyeah> means annoy some people
[08:24:54] <hellyeah> :D
[08:24:59] <taplar> no, you don't have to chuck
[08:25:05] <taplar> your pseudocode is not chunking
[08:25:34] <hellyeah> yes you are right
[08:25:38] <hellyeah> when i hits 10
[08:25:43] <hellyeah> it add to dom
[08:25:47] <hellyeah> and set null to element
[08:25:52] <hellyeah> and i will be 11
[08:25:57] <hellyeah> and when it become 20
[08:26:00] <taplar> you'll never be 11
[08:26:02] <hellyeah> it add to dom
[08:26:03] <hellyeah> etc.
[08:26:13] <hellyeah> hmm
[08:26:32] <taplar> since you create a new table for each 10
[08:26:41] <hellyeah> existingrows has 144 tows
[08:26:47] <hellyeah> rows*
[08:26:54] <taplar> yeah, you'll be 11 for existing rows, but that's not relevant
[08:27:10] <taplar> your concern is for the side of your new tables
[08:27:15] <taplar> side = size
[08:27:30] <hellyeah> sure sure
[08:27:32] <hellyeah> sorry
[08:27:40] <hellyeah> thank you for helping
[08:27:44] <hellyeah> have a nice day

[09:32:38] <dimi1947> give me a minute...to see something
[09:35:05] <dimi1947> got it
[09:37:59] <Whiskey> http://jsfiddle.net/Slaktarn/0tq1dya3/ <-- is it possible to load every line whitout last and make it in a <pre> tag
[09:39:41] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[09:41:10] <Whiskey> robertmaxrees: that fiddle loop all lines from the $get and print out every one whit <span> content </span> right?
[09:41:25] <Whiskey> line by line
[09:41:43] <robertmaxrees> okay.
[09:42:16] <Whiskey> don´t you see what the code does?
[09:42:26] <robertmaxrees> i see what the code does - what are you trying to do?
[09:42:49] <Whiskey> i ask how to get the last line it print out to be in <pre><pre/> insted of span
[09:43:34] <robertmaxrees> oh - lots of different ways.  check to see if the current value is the last index of the array.
[09:43:46] <Whiskey> how do you do that=?
[09:44:20] <Whiskey> array.last() maybe
[09:44:24] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/0tq1dya3/1/
[09:45:06] <robertmaxrees> check the index + 1 vs lines.length
[09:48:06] <daverich> I have a weird question. I have the following code: http://pastebin.com/BtJZfuLw. Just before setting the value of the textbox I am printing out the value with a console.log(), the console.log() value prints the correct value (integer) for both guest ID and escort ID, jQuery updates the guest textbox value properly, but doesn't update the escort textbox before the form submits.
[09:49:02] <robertmaxrees> first off - bind to the submit event, not the button click.
[09:49:57] <robertmaxrees> second off, this code is all sorts of invalid :)
[09:50:11] <robertmaxrees> you can't declare a variable twice.
[09:51:19] <daverich> why the submit event instead of button click?
[09:51:26] <robertmaxrees> because that's the event you care about in this case.
[09:51:36] <robertmaxrees> plus users can submit forms by pressing enter on their keyboard.
[09:51:46] <Only-UhOh> The one and Only-UhOh ...thief
[09:52:35] <daverich> well users can also use IE.. that's their problem lol
[09:52:42] <robertmaxrees> uh.
[09:52:53] <Only-UhOh> what's IE?
[09:52:56] <robertmaxrees> except IE isn't a terrible browser any more and jQuery makes that a relative non-issue.
[09:54:14] <daverich> IE's still pretty awful, but anyway. I've bound to the form submit, and am only declaring my vars once. Now the form just repeats printing out to console.log
[09:54:17] <Whiskey> robertmaxrees: thanks
[09:54:23] <robertmaxrees> daverich not awful at all.
[09:54:34] <robertmaxrees> https://bpaste.net/show/6d71a63d3f08
[09:55:09] <robertmaxrees> iirc there are more fixes in jquery core for chrome/safari than IE.
[10:00:54] <daverich> thanks robertmaxrees, that does work with a few mods.
[10:01:03] <robertmaxrees> understand the basic idea?
[10:01:30] <robertmaxrees> oh, the second one needed a $(this).trigger('submit', true) in there.
[10:01:54] <daverich> I do. I'm still not totally convinced on jQuery / JS... the whole event-based language is kind of frustrating. But I can see it's upside.
[10:02:30] <daverich> NodeJS Callbacks / Promises are a pain in my arse.
[10:02:31] <taplar_afk> it's bubbling up side?
[10:02:33] <taplar_afk> :D
[10:03:26] <robertmaxrees> promises are awesome.
[10:03:33] <robertmaxrees> and event-based stuff is actually kind of nice.
[10:11:56] <Whiskey> robertmaxrees: http://jsfiddle.net/Slaktarn/0tq1dya3/2/ <-- how can i get the time and date ticking whit a real clock ?
[10:12:14] <Whiskey> its gets lets say an style to fallow, but how to put a real clock in there
[10:12:36] <robertmaxrees> uh.
[10:12:44] <robertmaxrees> what's with the middle finder?
[10:12:49] <taplar> lol
[10:12:57] <robertmaxrees> and what do you mean "real clock"?
[10:13:11] <Whiskey> you see 07.31.15 19:11:39 <--- how to make that work in real time
[10:13:32] <Whiskey> thats why i needed an identifyer for the class so it know where to check
[10:14:28] <robertmaxrees> use a recursive timeout function.
[10:14:49] <robertmaxrees> thats coming from your server, right?
[10:14:54] <Whiskey> yeh
[10:15:10] <robertmaxrees> then call the ajax method within its own .done()
[10:15:18] <Whiskey> i just not how to build a timer
[10:15:33] <Whiskey> well strupid to make ajax request every second
[10:15:39] <taplar> a countdown?
[10:15:57] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[10:15:59] <Whiskey> taplar: no not really just a clock that go after the user systems clock
[10:16:07] <robertmaxrees> then use the Date() object.
[10:16:07] <taplar> k
[10:16:13] <robertmaxrees> lots of tutorials out there on how to do that.
[10:16:29] <Whiskey> well even if i figure that out how to get it in place where the time is
[10:16:36] <taplar> out of curiosity, what's the use case for that?  i mean, i got a clock on my phone
[10:16:43] <taplar> and my desktop
[10:17:06] <Whiskey> well thats not the point reall
[10:17:07] <Whiskey> well thats not the point really
[10:17:32] <taplar> just curious
[10:17:32] <robertmaxrees> Whiskey you could use .filter() to find the span that contains "IP Logged"
[10:17:41] <robertmaxrees> but why are you building this in the first place?
[10:19:17] <Whiskey> http://jsfiddle.net/Slaktarn/0tq1dya3/3/ something like that
[10:19:33] <Whiskey> but i not sure how to put the last peace together
[10:19:38] <robertmaxrees> could you maybe not use a middle finger as your ascii art?
[10:19:41] <robertmaxrees> folks are at work.
[10:19:43] <robertmaxrees> thx.
[10:20:26] <Whiskey> Hehe its not that bad :/
[10:20:30] <robertmaxrees> it's bad enough.
[10:21:10] <taplar> i don't see it myself, getting cors
[10:21:25] <robertmaxrees> broken in chrome it looks like.
[10:21:35] <taplar> yah
[10:22:19] <robertmaxrees> either way, Whiskey you're on the right track - but https://bpaste.net/show/37e7edbe6b43
[10:22:26] <robertmaxrees> no need to add that arg to calc
[10:22:53] <Whiskey> :/
[10:23:47] <Whiskey> http://jsfiddle.net/Slaktarn/0tq1dya3/4/ something like this, i have no clue how to cache the right place
[10:24:15] <robertmaxrees> please don't use a middle finger as your return.
[10:24:26] <robertmaxrees> people are at work.
[10:25:13] <robertmaxrees> and i already told you how to select the relevant bit - use .filteR()
[10:26:09] <robertmaxrees> brb
[10:26:46] <robertmaxrees> back
[10:26:58] <Whiskey> robertmaxrees: batter? http://jsfiddle.net/Slaktarn/0tq1dya3/5/
[10:38:00] <vacho> why on earth doesn't this become disabled? <select disabled="disabled" id="location-select" name="location" class="form-control">
[10:39:33] <taplar> is for me
[10:39:42] <taplar> http://jsfiddle.net/tc0h3vxh/
[10:41:17] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/knjqyg23/ same here.
[10:41:30] <vacho> ok, might be a plugin then..thanks guys!
[10:44:20] <Whiskey> http://jsfiddle.net/Slaktarn/0tq1dya3/7/ <--- that has to be close
[10:46:30] <robertmaxrees> how are you lost?
[10:51:06] <robertmaxrees> Whiskey also, check your console
[10:51:25] <Whiskey> Yeh but i have no clue what im doing anymore so :/
[10:51:35] <Whiskey> feels like to mutch code for a small task
[10:51:38] <robertmaxrees> now's a great time to learn!
[10:52:14] <Whiskey> yeh i do try
[10:52:24] <robertmaxrees> so how are you stuck?
[10:53:01] <Whiskey> whit everything i don´t know whats wrong and how to fix it how more clear can i be?
[10:53:09] <robertmaxrees> open your console.
[10:53:11] <robertmaxrees> fix that error first.
[10:53:31] <robertmaxrees> also, your calc function should probably come after that .each() call.
[10:53:40] <robertmaxrees> oh nvm you're doing that.
[10:54:01] <Whiskey> How?
[10:54:04] <robertmaxrees> here - start with http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide1
[10:54:23] <Whiskey> hmmm
[10:55:28] <Whiskey> http://jsfiddle.net/Slaktarn/0tq1dya3/9/ thats can be more close
[10:55:48] <robertmaxrees> follow the debugging guide :)
[10:55:51] <robertmaxrees> it'll help you learn.
[10:57:16] <Whiskey> naa
[10:57:18] <Whiskey> can´t be that hard
[10:57:23] <robertmaxrees> nope, it's not :)
[10:57:30] <Whiskey> Got rid of that errors
[10:58:14] <robertmaxrees> so what do you think the problem is?
[10:58:24] <Whiskey> no clue atm
[10:58:33] <Whiskey> timeElement = ('#Time > pre.toggleable.Text'); maybe
[10:58:35] <robertmaxrees> you sure var timeElement = ('#Time > pre.toggleable.Text'); is what you think it is?
[10:58:41] <Whiskey> no
[10:58:48] <Whiskey> i think thats not valid
[10:58:53] <robertmaxrees> probably ;)
[10:59:03] <Whiskey> but i have no clue what it should be
[10:59:23] <robertmaxrees> you can use .filter() to find the element with some text in it.
[10:59:51] <robertmaxrees> or you could search by class - looks like your html has a class around the time.
[11:00:23] <Whiskey> ok?
[11:00:33] <robertmaxrees> what's the issue?
[11:01:49] <Whiskey> i don´t get it
[11:01:50] <Whiskey> timeElement = $("Time").filter( "IP Logged" )
[11:02:00] <robertmaxrees> you don't even need filter here.
[11:02:04] <robertmaxrees> there's a class around the time.
[11:02:06] <robertmaxrees> so select that class.
[11:02:19] <Whiskey> well atm it feels like i don´t give a shit as the code is crappy as hell
[11:02:52] <robertmaxrees> you're pretty close.
[11:03:12] <robertmaxrees> just need to move some things around and change what you're targeting.
[11:03:16] <Whiskey> yeh and i pretty close to lose my temper also
[11:03:33] <taplar> take a break then, a breather
[11:03:34] <Whiskey> 1.5h for a damn clock
[11:03:37] <robertmaxrees> i'm sorry you're so frustrated.  how can we help?
[11:03:50] <taplar> find some cat vids
[11:04:13] <taplar> i recommend sad cat diary
[11:04:21] <Whiskey> I still feels like it need alot more lines for that task
[11:04:25] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[11:04:28] <Whiskey> or does it have to be that many looks like a mess
[11:04:31] <robertmaxrees> you don't  just a function.
[11:05:25] <robertmaxrees> the part where you're selecting the time element inside calc() needs to be updated - just use $('.time').
[11:05:30] <robertmaxrees> since that's the element you create.
[11:06:14] <Whiskey> $('.time'). where?
[11:06:29] <robertmaxrees> in calc() - see where you're doing a selector?
[11:07:13] <Whiskey> $('.Time', timeElement).text(pad(date.getHours()) + ":" + pad(date.getMinutes()) + ":" + pad(date.getSeconds())); that one?
[11:07:17] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[11:07:25] <robertmaxrees> fix the selector to point to the right element.
[11:07:26] <robertmaxrees> start with that.
[11:07:47] <Whiskey> yeh i change element to Time
[11:07:53] <robertmaxrees> just .time
[11:07:53] <Whiskey> container.append(value.split(/\r?\n/).slice(-3).join('\n').replace(/(\d+:\d+:\d+)/,'<span class="Time">$1</span>')
[11:08:10] <robertmaxrees> the fiddle you linked uses a lowercase t for time.
[11:08:11] <Whiskey> ok
[11:08:17] <Whiskey> yeh i know
[11:08:25] <robertmaxrees> the next issue is where you're declating the date variable.
[11:08:42] <robertmaxrees> it gets created once, so it'll never update with the new time.
[11:09:08] <Whiskey> http://jsfiddle.net/0tq1dya3/11/
[11:09:30] <robertmaxrees> just the selector part.
[11:09:32] <robertmaxrees> not the entire line.
[11:09:57] <Whiskey> set var date = new Date(); in the calc function
[11:10:08] <robertmaxrees> that, too.
[11:10:42] <Whiskey> ok more?
[11:10:50] <robertmaxrees> show me what you have now.
[11:11:08] <Whiskey> http://jsfiddle.net/Slaktarn/0tq1dya3/12/
[11:11:31] <robertmaxrees> ...
[11:11:34] <Whiskey> ?
[11:11:37] <robertmaxrees> .text(pad(date.getHours()) + ":" + pad(date.getMinutes()) + ":" + pad(date.getSeconds())); - you removed this.
[11:11:42] <robertmaxrees> you jsut needed to update the selector.
[11:11:56] <robertmaxrees> not the entire line.
[11:12:01] <Whiskey> did i
[11:12:08] <Whiskey> ops
[11:13:11] <Whiskey> well it give some error
[11:13:16] <Whiskey> its from the element crap
[11:13:16] <robertmaxrees> show me what you have now...
[11:13:21] <robertmaxrees> because it shouldn't error.
[11:13:49] <Whiskey> well i did lie
[11:13:59] <Whiskey> var date = new Date();
[11:14:02] <Whiskey> haha
[11:14:10] <Whiskey> jsfiddle.net/Slaktarn/0tq1dya3/13/
[11:14:29] <robertmaxrees> ...
[11:14:34] <gambl0re> hey, whats up playboy!...
[11:14:34] <Whiskey> ?
[11:14:40] <robertmaxrees> $('.Time', timeElement).text(pad(date.getHours()) + ":" + pad(date.getMinutes()) + ":" + pad(date.getSeconds())); is still wrong.
[11:14:55] <robertmaxrees> $('.Time').text(pad(date.getHours()) + ":" + pad(date.getMinutes()) + ":" + pad(date.getSeconds())); is what you want there.  kill the single $('.Time') call.
[11:15:21] <Whiskey> Weee :D
[11:15:48] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/0tq1dya3/14/ is a little cleaner.
[11:15:58] <robertmaxrees> move the calc() call out of the $.each()
[11:16:06] <mrpinc> I've got a draggable that matches the size of a droppable - I get the drop event just fine, is there a way to get the dragable() to animate to the position of the dropbbale() on drop
[11:17:15] <robertmaxrees> mrpinc what do you mean "animate to the position of the droppable"?
[11:17:26] <Whiskey> yeh i don´t like the pad shit don´t jQuery has stuff to make it clean robertmaxrees
[11:17:40] <robertmaxrees> Whiskey huh?
[11:18:09] <Whiskey> yeh to don´t make a mess in your javascript section :D
[11:18:22] <mrpinc> like a snap to.  In order for the drop to work you only need a portion of the draggable and the droppable to overlap - once the drop is deemed successful, the draggable should animate so its position matches that of the droppable - effectively hiding the droppable since the draggable would be directly overtop
[11:18:24] <robertmaxrees> i need you to clarify what you mean, Whiskey
[11:18:45] <robertmaxrees> mrpinc https://api.jqueryui.com/draggable/#option-snap
[11:19:33] <Whiskey> hehe i have to take a break, see if you here when i come back robertmaxrees, anyways thanks alot
[11:19:42] <decx> pad?
[11:19:44] <Whiskey> robertmaxrees, jQuery make your life more easy to live
[11:19:54] <robertmaxrees> Whiskey i'm aware.
[11:19:56] <Whiskey> decx pad?
[11:20:01] <robertmaxrees> you're not being clear about what you're trying to fix.
[11:20:14] <robertmaxrees> you said "yeh i don´t like the pad shit don´t jQuery has stuff to make it clean robertmaxrees" - what does this have to do with jquery?
[11:20:15] <decx> i just used a pad function yesterday
[11:20:41] <decx> and never seen the word in that context before ^^
[11:21:10] <robertmaxrees> he has a pad functiin in his code.
[11:21:18] <robertmaxrees> i think that's what he's talking about.
[11:21:51] <decx> i used it to make filenames 01 or 001 depending on the maxnumber just yesterday
[11:22:10] <decx> http://jsfiddle.net/decx/07s5ph88/
[11:22:45] <mrpinc> nah that is not it.  'snap' makes it snap to other draggables - I want it to effectively do the same thing that 'revert' does - but not to its original position, rather to match the target 'droppable'
[11:23:26] <robertmaxrees> mrpinc that's not accurate at all - you can specify the element it should snap to.
[11:26:46] <mrpinc> ok well either way i don't want it to snap - if the usor drops incorrectly it should revert, if they drop correctly then it should animate to the exact same location as the droppable  item
[11:32:37] <robertmaxrees> i feel like that's exactly what you want.
[11:32:38] <robertmaxrees> lol
[11:36:33] <gambl0re> hey robermatrix...i got this question. $(.selector).text('selector Class);
[11:36:53] <robertmaxrees> i don't think that person is around right now.
[11:36:59] <robertmaxrees> are you talking to me?
[11:37:05] <gambl0re> ya
[11:37:10] <gambl0re> its pretty simple right?
[11:37:12] <robertmaxrees> that's not my screenname.
[11:37:18] <mrpinc> bob matrix
[11:37:24] <robertmaxrees> and i don't understand what the question is.
[11:37:35] <gambl0re> they asked me what the question did...
[11:37:40] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[11:37:42] <gambl0re> what the code did
[11:37:48] <robertmaxrees> that very code does nothing.
[11:37:49] <gambl0re> $(.selector).text('selector Class);
[11:37:52] <robertmaxrees> it would throw an error.
[11:37:55] <gambl0re> why
[11:38:03] <robertmaxrees> because $(.selector) isn't valid.
[11:38:32] <gambl0re> there!!! $('.selector').text('selector Class);
[11:38:39] <gambl0re> happy?
[11:38:44] <taplar> no
[11:38:46] <robertmaxrees> that would still error. missing a closing quote.
[11:38:57] <gambl0re> there!!! $('.selector').text('selector Class');
[11:38:59] <gambl0re> there
[11:39:01] <robertmaxrees> and that would set the text of $('.selector') to "selector class'
[11:39:12] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/text/
[11:39:15] <gambl0re> i know that
[11:39:23] <robertmaxrees> uh, then why are you asking me?
[11:39:31] <gambl0re> its so simple why they would even bother asking is mind bogglng right?
[11:39:39] <taplar> so you came and asked us
[11:39:46] <robertmaxrees> ^
[11:40:25] <robertmaxrees> and fwiw, you got my username wrong again.  that wasn't even an autocomplete mistake.  you straight up type the wrong name again.
[11:40:50] <gambl0re> you keep complaining...
[11:40:58] <gambl0re> just relax once in a while..
[11:41:11] <gambl0re> chill man.
[11:41:12] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[11:41:19] <robertmaxrees> i'm just letting you know that you got it wrong again.
[11:41:34] <gambl0re> breathe..
[11:41:50] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[11:41:53] <taplar> also using the correct alias in chat is also benificial as atleast in the web chat version it highlights the line so you know someone is talking to you
[11:42:03] <robertmaxrees> ^ same with just about any other client.
[11:44:38] <robertmaxrees> how's everybody doing today?
[11:44:50] <taplar> 1:16 min to go
[11:45:03] <robertmaxrees> awesome.
[11:45:07] <taplar> lol
[11:45:33] <taplar> also had a pretty long discussion on pseudocode earlier that was kinda interesting if you missed it
[11:45:39] <taplar> guess they don't teach that in school
[11:45:40] <ngharo> Can anyone help me understand why these two testcases behave differentely? https://jsfiddle.net/2wwkk5oj/1/
[11:46:32] <ngharo> check the console for barking... I don't get why i cant pass a reference to Object.method and instead have to wrap it in an anonymous function call
[11:46:54] <ngharo> when using .then()
[11:47:24] <robertmaxrees> context.  your 'this' isn't what it should be i'm guessing.
[11:47:46] <robertmaxrees> it's about invocation context, not the function.
[11:48:30] <robertmaxrees> check out your console - this.deferred is undefined.
[11:49:02] <ngharo> yeah, i get what you mean but I'm not sure how invoke sound2.play different where context is correct
[11:49:40] <ngharo> seriously, this works: sound.play(2).then(sound2.play.bind(sound2));
[11:49:46] <ngharo> there must be a cleaner way
[11:50:20] <robertmaxrees> not really - you're using two different objects.
[11:51:33] <ngharo> bugger
[11:51:55] <taplar> sonic or klinex?
[11:52:30] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[11:52:36] <taplar> nvm, being stupid
[11:52:46] <robertmaxrees> oh, bad pun.
[12:54:05] <Whiskey> :P
[12:56:19] <QueenKekx> Hello All was hoping someone could help me out. Im trying to use autocomplete ui to generate results (that i have working already) but im trying to show name and email in the results dropdown as well as allow multiple people to select with a comma to break between. anyone know of a place i see some examples or figure out how to do this/
[13:01:20] <Whiskey> robertmaxrees: :D ?
[13:05:44] <esaym153> so I am kinda new to jQuery and I am trying to clean up some code by building a class around it. I am not really sure aboue the scope of a 'jquery instance', but I assume I can't just put a call to jquery in a class prototype like this: http://pastie.org/private/npstwpk5tdcl3gtiwabhtq I assume the current jquery instance would have to be passed in as a parameter?
[13:51:29] <mynameisbrian> Can someone tell me why the first time you hit next, it does not slide? It fades out. But after this, the elements slide: http://codepen.io/anon/pen/oXJYvq
[13:54:21] <mynameisbrian> It gets the current element with the class of .current. It gets the next element, and the element after that (for other purposes not included in code). If the element after that exists, it does the animation on the .current element, hides it, and fades in the next
[13:54:36] <mynameisbrian> then removes .current on the current element, and puts it on the next. http://codepen.io/anon/pen/oXJYvq.js
[13:57:37] <mynameisbrian> shit I have to go. I'll come in later and ask again. thanks for anyone who has taken a look at it
[14:44:02] <graphettion> Can someone help me out (via teamviewer) about having a slideshow play and pause during the particular slide?
[14:44:06] <graphettion> Been at this all day.
[15:09:57] <Sarat_> .
[15:12:13] <graphettion> Is there anybody out there... out there... out there?
[15:12:15] <graphettion> :P
[15:14:28] <Sarat_> First time in an IRC... I expected more people to be talking.
[15:14:43] <pinc_> Im here you need not worry
[15:14:46] <pinc_> BAM!!!
[15:15:30] <graphettion> lol
[15:15:56] <graphettion> Can someone help me out (via teamviewer) about having a slideshow play and pause during the particular slide?
[15:16:19] <graphettion> it's a video on the slide show play/pause
[15:16:30] <pinc_> What slider plugin you using?
[15:16:35] <robertmaxrees> graphettion make a fiddle duder.
[15:16:37] <pinc_> Or is it vanilla?
[15:16:38] <graphettion> None.
[15:16:45] <pinc_> YEa, fiddle that then
[15:16:54] <graphettion> I'm trying. Uses ajax. Dang fiddle.
[15:17:17] <pinc_> Darn indeed. Can you just faux the ajax return for now
[15:17:25] <robertmaxrees> you can simulate ajax calls using jsfiddle fwiw.
[15:17:39] <pinc_> +1
[15:18:42] <Sarat_> Faux... just learned a new word.
[15:18:56] <graphettion> This is what I have so far. - http://jsfiddle.net/graphettion/0g40nj6y/
[15:19:02] <graphettion> Doesn't work, trying
[15:19:50] <graphettion> added ajax - http://jsfiddle.net/graphettion/0g40nj6y/1/
[15:20:13] <rcyr> It's c00lz to add random french words to english sentences :/
[15:20:27] <pinc_> lol
[15:20:52] <graphettion> wrong ajax - http://jsfiddle.net/graphettion/0g40nj6y/2/ :P
[15:26:46] <graphettion> Best I can do - http://jsfiddle.net/graphettion/0g40nj6y/4/
[15:26:48] <graphettion> dang fiddle
[15:30:11] <robertmaxrees> woah.
[15:30:16] <robertmaxrees> what's the issue here?
[15:30:43] <graphettion> considering the code is ugly
[15:31:00] <graphettion> I'm trying to get the video to pause and the next one to play on each slide
[15:31:11] <graphettion> But the video isn't even showing up, lol
[15:31:15] <graphettion> on fiddle
[15:31:27] <robertmaxrees> so not to be a jerk here - why are you using a carousel at all?
[15:31:42] <graphettion> You mean why am I not using?
[15:31:52] <robertmaxrees> why are you.
[15:31:55] <robertmaxrees> since that's what you're developing.
[15:32:06] <graphettion> I'm basically doing a show me/try me. So people learn how to do things.
[15:32:19] <graphettion> You show the user what to do, then they do it themselves.
[15:32:40] <graphettion> I'm trying to show them a video.
[15:33:04] <robertmaxrees> i'd make each of those pages.
[15:34:27] <robertmaxrees> but either way, let me take another look at your fiddle.
[15:35:03] <graphettion> Kind of pointless to look at it, because it doesn't work lol
[15:35:12] <robertmaxrees> then i'm not sure how you want us to help.
[15:35:20] <robertmaxrees> requiring that we use teamviewer is kind of heavy-handed.
[15:35:29] <robertmaxrees> and not really all that helpful.
[15:35:34] <graphettion> Yeah, don't know how else to present it.
[15:35:42] <graphettion> Thanks though.
[15:35:55] <robertmaxrees> check out http://fixingthesejquery.com/
[15:36:45] <graphettion> I got it all working except the previous button.
[15:37:21] <graphettion> Been console.logging the whole day
[15:37:22] <graphettion> lol
[15:37:27] <robertmaxrees> use a debugger yo.
[15:37:39] <robertmaxrees> instead of abusing console.log
[15:38:04] <graphettion> lol, I'm in panic mode right now.
[15:38:39] <graphettion> I'll take a look at it though. Thanks!
[17:10:40] <Sarat_> Is there a way to suppress these quit and join notifications?
[17:11:54] <decx> use a client that does it
[17:12:44] <Sarat_> What client do you prefer?
[17:20:32] <shoky> Sarat_ you can supress them in freenode webchat options
[17:42:57] <acidjazz> is this wrong or am i high .admin.admin_content > .subheader > .menu > .items > .item.icon:hover {
[17:46:00] <Compatriot> I personally like more component based css. Where you would just build the item, and drop the item in anywhere. Even if the item wasn't in a menu.
[17:46:18] <Compatriot> icon-item icon-cart icon-save icon-delete
[17:47:03] <Compatriot> So there would be no need to nest the icon inside such a huge train of direct child selectors
[17:47:08] <Compatriot> Like how bootstrap does it
[17:48:04] <Compatriot> So if you were using sass, you could do icon {  icon-save{} icon-delete{} }
[17:48:14] <Compatriot> <span class="icon icon-save">
[17:48:26] <Compatriot> personally I use <i></i> for icons
[18:09:26] <Insentience> what's the shorthand for node.children().eq(4)
[18:09:42] <Insentience> tried using .children(4) but it doesnt give me what i want
[18:10:43] <shoky> there isn't. maybe .find('> :eq(4)')  would work but much less readable
[18:13:16] <Insentience> yeah, was just asking because .children().eq(4) is kinda messy imo, but that doesnt help
[18:13:21] <Insentience> oh well i can work with it, thank you
[21:47:10] <Compatriot> So quiet....
[22:36:05] <GeSS> exit
