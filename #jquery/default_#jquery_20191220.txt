[06:31:43] <grid-> hey
[08:24:37] <Inazad> I use the jquery component jstree. I got 2 trees. How I can do tree1.refresh() while in a function binded to the tree2 ?
[08:27:37] <Inazad> why I cannot access a jsTree function while in a binded function of another jstree ?

[08:30:31] <Inazad> why I cannot access a jsTree function while in a binded function of another jstree ?
[09:00:08] <thykka> Inazad, you could store a reference to tree1 in a closure or such.. kinda hard to give exact advice without seeing your code.
[09:01:17] <thykka> or just reselect the first tree
[09:32:52] <grid-> does somebody know if something like this http://www.lisenme.com/demo/Dropdown_Filter_Search/ excist so it will just upload the selectboxes instead of a table? like a plugin or something, or does anyone know how i could find it, what search key words etc
[09:38:20] <Inazad> thykka, cause when I declare my code, i store the reference into a variable
[09:38:50] <Inazad> thykka, but the event called is binded like tree1.jstree.bind('copy_node', function .....
[09:39:00] <Inazad> in the scope of tree1, I cannot access the tree2 ...
[14:20:36] <admin123> anyone use datatables?
[14:21:02] <robertmaxrees> a lot of people do :)
[14:21:20] <admin123> wondering if it can query by 500 items but display 20 at a time
[14:21:28] <robertmaxrees> no need to ask if somebody uses something - ask your question out to the channel.  if somebody can help, they will.
[14:21:52] <robertmaxrees> https://datatables.net/reference/option/paging
[14:21:55] <robertmaxrees> this is what you want.
[14:22:27] <robertmaxrees> there's also https://datatables.net/examples/basic_init/alt_pagination.html
[14:24:29] <robertmaxrees> admin123 this what you're looking for?
[15:02:15] <admin123> robertmaxrees: I'll read it. won't know until I read it
[15:07:54] <admin123> https://datatables.net/examples/basic_init/alt_pagination.html only covers the display options for the pagination, buttons etc
[15:08:35] <admin123> I want to do https://datatables.net/manual/server-side but I want the ui to paginate by a different page_size than the ajax requests are fetching for
[15:09:19] <admin123> I want to do like an infinite timeline idea, where we prefetch data for the UI so that the user waits less as they read through data.
[15:09:38] <admin123> ajax fetch 1000 records, datatables display 100 rows at a time.
[16:45:13] <admin123> can datatables be programmed to send back extra query parameters?
[17:11:49] <robertmaxrees> i'd ask in the datatables forums for that kinda stuff :)
[17:56:59] <primitivMedia> https://bpaste.net/show/DL5E4 trying to change the value of an input then submit the form
[17:57:09] <primitivMedia> but it submits the form without the value being changed
[17:57:15] <primitivMedia> not sure why?
[18:08:38] <primitivMedia> ?
[18:30:52] <primitivMedia>   $("#twitter-form").submit(function(event) { when I use this it doesnt pass the submit button name into the POST request
[18:30:54] <primitivMedia> why is that ?
[18:33:13] <robertmaxrees> "doesn't pass the submit button name into the POST request"??
[18:33:19] <robertmaxrees> i think we need to see more code.
[18:33:41] <primitivMedia> https://bpaste.net/show/NWXLS
[18:33:59] <primitivMedia> this submits fine, but my submit button which is name="twiter_submit"
[18:34:08] <primitivMedia> does not appear in my $_POST request when I retrieve it
[18:34:28] <robertmaxrees> pretty sure the button doesn't get passed in.
[18:35:01] <robertmaxrees> let me guess: you have two submit buttons and want to know which was pressed.
[18:35:03] <primitivMedia> because of the jqueyr method I'm using
[18:35:08] <primitivMedia> because normally it would
[18:35:12] <primitivMedia> only one
[18:35:26] <robertmaxrees> make a fiddle then :)
[18:36:53] <robertmaxrees> also: fwiw if(condition === true) { can be just if (condition) {
[18:37:07] <primitivMedia> is the .submit() function not going to pass the submit button
[18:37:15] <primitivMedia> all i need to know
[18:37:29] <robertmaxrees> the submit method binds a listener to the submit event.
[18:37:36] <robertmaxrees> so your question doesn't really make sense :)
[18:38:01] <robertmaxrees> it doesn't mess with the post body unless you make it modify the form.
[18:38:33] <primitivMedia> im not modiying the submit button tho
[18:38:39] <primitivMedia> it should be present via php
[18:39:34] <robertmaxrees> i don't think i've ever seen the submit button get passed in as part of the post body.
[18:39:59] <primitivMedia> well yes like if isset($_POST['submit'])
[18:40:11] <primitivMedia> it would return true if the name is indeed present on the form being sent
[18:40:19] <primitivMedia> this is not returning true
[18:40:29] <robertmaxrees> interesting.  looks like i was wrong.  just validated in a fiddle.
[18:40:36] <robertmaxrees> so long as it has a name and value.
[18:41:10] <primitivMedia> ahh i know why lol
[18:41:13] <robertmaxrees> ?
[18:41:15] <primitivMedia> my button is outside my fomr
[18:41:28] <robertmaxrees> heh.  remember when I asked for a fiddle? ;)
[18:41:34] <robertmaxrees> there's a reason we ask for 'em.
[18:42:33] <primitivMedia> thank you sir
[18:42:55] <robertmaxrees> though now my next question - why are you trying to pass in the button through a form?
[18:44:30] <primitivMedia> to make sure the form got submitted but I guess i dont need the submit button for that
[18:45:03] <robertmaxrees> i mean, if the server gets a POST, the form then submitted :)
[18:45:08] <robertmaxrees> *was then
[18:46:35] <primitivMedia> that is also true
