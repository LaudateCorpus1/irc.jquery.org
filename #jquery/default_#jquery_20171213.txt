[01:43:02] <bobdobbs> This might be a stupid question, but I want to confirm somethign...
[01:43:58] <bobdobbs> If I download a script using $.getScript, and the function returns successfully... then the methods in the downloaded script should be available once getScript has returned, right?
[02:04:20] <bobdobbs> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47786731/how-can-i-make-the-youtube-api-library-accessible-to-my-page-after-loading-it-wi
[02:05:23] <bobdobbs> So, I'm loading a script using getScript. I use the done() method on getScript to run a function if the script is loaded successfully
[02:05:43] <bobdobbs> I can see from my browsers network tab that getScript has indeed loaded the script
[02:06:42] <bobdobbs> But the weird thing is that within the done() method I can't call the methods made available from the script I loaded
[02:07:08] <bobdobbs> However, I *can* use the methods from the script I download if I'm hacking in the browser console
[02:29:53] <Uhkis> bobdobbs: does it work if you pass the script variable to the function and use script.YT.Player etc
[03:11:29] <bobdobbs> Uhkis: lets see...
[03:13:06] <bobdobbs> no
[03:13:35] <bobdobbs> Uhkis: instead of geting YT undefined, I basically get 'script.YT undefined'
[03:13:56] <bobdobbs> but that'd be a hack anyway. In theory YT should be available
[03:14:13] <bobdobbs> and if I test from the console, 'window.YT' is available
[03:14:41] <bobdobbs> It's odd, cos the object is available from the console, but not from my script
[03:15:06] <bobdobbs> I guess there might be something abuot getScript that I don't understand?
[03:16:32] <bobdobbs> My understanding is that should be able to get a script, and by it's execution make that scripts properties from the script that is calling getScript

[09:25:03] <dattz> Hi Guys
[09:25:16] <dattz> have a question related to jQuery UI Datepicker
[09:26:14] <dattz> I need to make it so it reads the text
[09:26:18] <dattz> (for screen readers)
[09:26:44] <dattz> when the user moves the date (using Ctrl/Cmd+arrow keys)
[09:26:54] <dattz> Do we have an event for that
[09:27:20] <dattz> onSelect is only called when you press space & select that date.
[09:29:03] <dattz_> anyone?
[09:57:33] <Rhaal> Greetings! https://hastebin.com/nirotewuta.js For some reason, jQuery().val() is returning a different value whether * triggered by normal element change * Triggered through jQuery().trigger('change') * Procedurally invoked. Only the first one is returning the correct value, while the others log to null. why? : (
[11:06:00] <Sal> hi
[11:06:10] <Sal> can someone give me a hand on this: http://jsbin.com/pejifegizi/edit?js,output
[11:06:32] <Sal> i got a piece of code that sticks sections headers on top of page while scrolling
[11:07:02] <Sal> and i want to convert it to be used also inside a div paren container instead of the window
[11:07:23] <Sal> i'm trying, but i keep gettin elements that stick wrong
[11:07:41] <Sal> con someone more expert see where i'm failing
[12:15:11] <dimi1947> https://jsfiddle.net/fiddlehunt/gkgkp5qq/6/ line 78 to 84...the code checks if the user has not filled the input fields(click edit and then the + sign to add inputs))...I want to highlight/style the non-filled inputs...currently the way the code it is I can only style the first(line 81),but what about the other ones
[12:33:12] <amundir> dimi1947: i don't see any highlighting in that fiddle.  if i click the broken image at the top and then add two more options and click save, all the inputs disappear
[12:33:51] <dimi1947> amundir:give me a minute
[12:35:04] <dimi1947> amundir:I will have to fix that...I do not know how mucht time it will take
[12:39:33] <dimi1947> amundir:try again...fixed it https://jsfiddle.net/fiddlehunt/gkgkp5qq/8/
[12:43:17] <amundir> k, so where's the highlighting?
[13:00:15] <JuJUBee> How do I do a slide left with one div while bringing in a new div in its place?  Like the google sign in process where the divs are not full page
[13:01:53] <robertmaxrees> JuJUBee there are a few ways you could do that.
[13:02:05] <JuJUBee> do elaborate
[13:02:08] <JuJUBee> please
[13:02:32] <robertmaxrees> JuJUBee one would be to wrap them both in a container and abuse margins.
[13:02:43] <robertmaxrees> you're basically looking for what a carousel does haha
[13:03:34] <JuJUBee> OMG, thanks so much.  I got it from here
[13:04:55] <robertmaxrees> make sense?
[13:05:24] <JuJUBee> perfectly
[13:05:32] <JuJUBee> I just didn't know what that was called
[13:13:40] <JuJUBee> ilovewatermelon, Howdy
[13:14:18] <amundir> huh, i wouldn't have thought bees would be attracted to watermelons
[13:14:22] <ilovewatermelon> JuJUBee: Howdy
[13:14:53] <ilovewatermelon> Bees love watermelon amundir
[13:38:11] <thykka> nooo, don't abuse margins
[13:38:47] <thykka> better transform it
[13:38:57] <amundir> healthier than abusing butters
[13:39:48] <thykka> as a rule of thumb, never animate anything but transforms and/or opacity, if you wanna keep it 60fps
[13:39:58] <robertmaxrees> heh.
[14:51:39] <Toerkeium> guys, how do I get from an entire HTML ajax response only part of it, from an specific div?
[14:53:02] <amundir> when you say "entire" html, are you talking about a complete dom structure?
[14:53:14] <Toerkeium> amundir: yes
[14:53:38] <amundir> jQuery isn't really made to handle a complete dom structure.  it will eat some of the tags if you stick that in $().
[14:53:47] <amundir> but what elements are you after?
[14:54:39] <Toerkeium> amundir: it would be everything inside a div like this: <div class="grid grid12">
[14:54:53] <Toerkeium> it contains forms, divs, ul, li, etc
[14:55:04] <Toerkeium> and some javascript I believe
[14:55:10] <amundir> so have you tried putting the markup in $() and then doing a find for the class(es)?
[14:56:34] <Toerkeium> no idea what you're talking about amundir. I just did a xmlhttprequest, and get the entire dom structure result, which I need to get only part of it
[14:56:44] <amundir> right
[14:56:59] <amundir> which you can stick markup in $() and it will try to turn it into dom nodes
[14:57:07] <amundir> ex.  $('<div></div>')
[14:57:18] <amundir> would make a jQuery object containing one dom element which is a div
[14:57:35] <Toerkeium> aha
[14:57:37] <amundir> If i were to do something like
[14:57:54] <amundir> $('<div><span class="test"></span></div>').find('.test')
[14:57:56] <amundir> that's valid
[14:58:06] <Toerkeium> oh
[14:58:08] <Toerkeium> really?
[14:58:10] <amundir> yup
[14:58:11] <Toerkeium> I'm going to test it
[14:58:26] <Toerkeium> let me see
[14:58:30] <thykka> in the ajax success function, you could maybe do something like: function(data) { $('<div>').html($(data).find('.grid.grid12')) }
[14:58:52] <amundir> thykka: sticking a whole document in a div doesn't really help the issue
[14:59:59] <amundir> <html> isn't a valid child of a div either, :)
[15:00:26] <Toerkeium> amundir: function (data) { var here = data.find('.test'); }
[15:00:28] <Toerkeium> ?
[15:00:36] <amundir> $(data).find(...)
[15:00:53] <amundir> $(data) takes the markup and makes jQuery parse it
[15:01:01] <amundir> then off that you find what you want
[15:01:07] <Toerkeium> testing it
[15:20:06] <Toerkeium> amundir: after .find(), how do I get the html? it's converted into an object tree
[15:20:14] <Toerkeium> is there a way to make it raw html again?
[15:20:22] <amundir> different ways
[15:20:35] <amundir> .html() will get you the innerHTML of an element
[15:20:43] <amundir> prop('outerHTML') will get you the outerHTML
[15:23:08] <Toerkeium> wait, but why do I need to do the search before, if I can get the innerHTML using a jquery selector class?
[15:23:15] <Toerkeium> search/find
[15:23:32] <amundir> I'm assuming you want just the inner html of a particular element, right?
[15:23:40] <Toerkeium> yes
[15:23:52] <amundir> so if you don't do the search, how would you get -just- that html?
[15:24:57] <Toerkeium> oh oh sorry
[15:26:51] <thykka> https://api.jquery.com/load/
[15:26:59] <thykka> $( "#result" ).load( "ajax/test.html #container" );
[15:27:12] <Toerkeium> amundir: so this did it all jQuery(data).find(".grid_12").prop('innerHTML');
[15:27:14] <Toerkeium> great
[15:27:21] <amundir> cool
[15:27:25] <Toerkeium> oh, nice thykka, gonna check that too!
[15:27:34] <Toerkeium> thanks a lot amundir !
[15:27:36] <amundir> load would put the html on the page though
[15:27:58] <Toerkeium> you too thykka !
[15:28:22] <amundir> though i suppose you could make it load to a dom fragment too.  *shrug*
[15:47:10] <nikio_> man who makes these silly ajax/cors rules up
[15:47:23] <robertmaxrees> heh
[15:47:24] <robertmaxrees> like what?
[15:47:37] <amundir> cors isn't silly
[15:47:38] <nikio_> im logging in with ajax into a php web app, i managed to get it to set the php session cookie
[15:47:55] <amundir> imo
[15:48:02] <robertmaxrees> cors is super important.
[15:48:10] <robertmaxrees> and prevents a lot of really big security holes.
[15:48:19] <nikio_> but now for some strange reason some of my other subsequent ajax requests dont sent the php cookie back to the browser causing them to get a 401
[15:48:40] <amundir> are you setting the withCredentials to true?
[15:48:43] <nikio_> yes
[15:49:20] <amundir> and you're server side cors handling has Access-Control-Allow-Credentials set to true?
[15:49:22] <nikio_> this is not how you do security, this is how you make dev looks millions of hours of time
[15:49:46] <nikio_> yep as i said only part of the ajax requests fail to send the cookie to the server
[15:49:53] <robertmaxrees> nikio_ you do understand what CORS prevents, right?
[15:52:22] <nikio_> meh, i dont consider it a proper solution
[15:52:30] <robertmaxrees> what would a good solution look like?
[15:53:56] <nikio_> havent study it enough, but my intuition tells me its crappy
[15:54:00] <robertmaxrees> the concept is basic: let's say you've logged into your email account and then go to a site.  that site, using a simple ajax call, could make a request to your email provider under *your* credentials (since the request comes from your browser) and have access to whatever you have access to.
[15:54:17] <amundir> Only trust yourself, or others you explicitly trust.
[15:54:20] <amundir> Very proper
[15:54:34] <robertmaxrees> that's why the server needs to explicitly allow cross-domain access to a recourse.
[15:54:38] <robertmaxrees> *resource
[15:55:05] <robertmaxrees> replace "email" with literally any other service that needs auth.
[15:55:27] <robertmaxrees> could be bank accounts, router admin panels, internal company tools, etc.,
[15:56:11] <amundir> Also provided that's it's a web standard that is supported by the community and businesses and what not.  Your "intuition" doesn't really hold up.
[15:56:23] <amundir> contextually
[15:56:30] <nikio_> well i gave it permission
[15:56:52] <robertmaxrees> nikio_ right, so then there's no issue :)
[15:57:50] <amundir> you said it worked for some and not others, right?
[15:57:58] <nikio_> this the piece of my code that does the calls: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/1cd863cc8e10bebfda11d2a50ea57594
[15:58:02] <nikio_> yup
[15:58:11] <nikio_> they are wfs calls
[15:58:15] <amundir> are they different method types?
[15:58:16] <nikio_> and they dont work
[15:58:23] <nikio_> nope GET as you can see
[15:58:28] <robertmaxrees> are all the urls the same port, protocol, and domain?
[16:00:07] <nikio_> yes they go to my api url, i made a backend, it has login related routes, and also a geoserver route,
[16:00:19] <nikio_> thats where the wfs calls go\
[16:00:22] <robertmaxrees> so which routes are failing?
[16:00:49] <nikio_> the wfs one going to api.foo.com/geoserver/*
[16:01:06] <robertmaxrees> and the login url is api.foo.com as well?
[16:01:12] <robertmaxrees> same protocol and port?
[16:01:20] <amundir> hopefully login would be https
[16:01:24] <nikio_> yes they all go to 80
[16:01:27] <nikio_> yes
[16:01:28] <robertmaxrees> *it all would be https.
[16:01:29] <nikio_> ry
[16:01:31] <nikio_> sry
[16:01:36] <nikio_> 443
[16:01:38] <amundir> so login is 443
[16:01:53] <robertmaxrees> is the geo url behind https as well?
[16:02:01] <nikio_> yup
[16:02:10] <nikio_> you can go to 80 to but my apache redirects to 443
[16:02:20] <nikio_> and i only make 443 callsin my client app
[16:02:26] <nikio_> yup
[16:02:29] <robertmaxrees> are they both doign the same thing?
[16:02:34] <robertmaxrees> for that 443?
[16:02:56] <nikio_> as in?
[16:03:05] <amundir> the login doesn't do the redirect to 443, right?
[16:03:08] <robertmaxrees> do you redirect both of those urls to port 443
[16:03:09] <Es0teric> i am trying to find a class inside of an iframe but this: $('#tandc_content').contents().find('.guidelines-page #banner'); does not return the iframe
[16:03:14] <Es0teric> i mean it doesnt return the element
[16:03:30] <robertmaxrees> Es0teric is the iframe on another domain?
[16:03:39] <nikio_> no apache redirects them
[16:03:44] <nikio_> yes
[16:03:46] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees no
[16:03:52] <amundir> but do you submit login credentials to port 80?
[16:03:59] <robertmaxrees> Es0teric same port, protocol, and domain as the parent page?
[16:04:08] <nikio_> nope lol
[16:04:09] <Es0teric> yes _marc`
[16:04:15] <Es0teric> *yes robertmaxrees
[16:04:25] <robertmaxrees> Es0teric what happens if you do .find('div')?
[16:04:28] <robertmaxrees> do you get anything?
[16:04:48] <robertmaxrees> might also try '#banner' since it's an ID and should be unique.
[16:05:14] <nikio_> my :80 virtual host has this: Redirect permanent / https://api.foo.com
[16:05:14] <amundir> nikio_: so login goes straight to 443 without redirect.  but the other api ajax requests go to 80 and redirect to 443?
[16:05:26] <nikio_> nope i make https calls always
[16:05:32] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees nope it does not return anything
[16:05:36] <amundir> ok, so the redirect doesn't happen
[16:05:43] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees $('.body').find('#banner')
[16:05:59] <thykka> Es0teric, there's an element with class="body" ?
[16:06:06] <Es0teric> thykka whoops
[16:06:16] <Es0teric> ok so this: $('body').find('#banner')
[16:06:18] <Es0teric> returns an element
[16:06:21] <nikio_> let me investigate and double check again all that you sai
[16:06:22] <nikio_> d
[16:06:22] <amundir> you're always going to https://api.foo.com/ on your ajax calls
[16:06:40] <nikio_> https://api.foo.com/*  yes
[16:06:53] <amundir> the /* isn't important for CORS
[16:06:57] <nikio_> ok
[16:08:28] <robertmaxrees> something here seems funky.
[16:08:38] <nikio_> yeh whenever i make an api call i do: Config.getApiUrl()
[16:08:55] <nikio_> because that url is different between environments (test, dev, prod)
[16:09:20] <amundir> Ok, and where are you making these calls from?
[16:09:34] <amundir> Did you do a specific cors rule or a global '*' rule?
[16:09:37] <nikio_> and it returns https://api.foo.com
[16:09:50] <robertmaxrees> also: if cookies are involved, the path is relevant.
[16:09:57] <nikio_> specific. im making them from dev.foo.com
[16:10:09] <nikio_> https://dev.foo.com
[16:10:16] <amundir> ah, if the domain is set with the path on them, true
[16:10:32] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees
[16:10:36] <robertmaxrees> mmmyesssssss
[16:10:36] <Es0teric> did you see what i wrote?
[16:10:47] <robertmaxrees> Es0teric nope.
[16:10:49] <robertmaxrees> sup?
[16:11:17] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees so yeah $('body').find('#banner') returns an element
[16:11:17] <nikio_> the server always return  Set-Cookie  and then the phptoken, and for the path:  /
[16:11:23] <robertmaxrees> Es0teric uh
[16:11:44] <robertmaxrees> Es0teric is it the element in the iframe?
[16:11:44] <Es0teric> but when i query the iframe it does not return it
[16:11:53] <robertmaxrees> how are you querying the iframe?
[16:12:36] <robertmaxrees> super lost.
[16:13:09] <amundir> ok, so your path is /
[16:13:12] <amundir> what is your domain?
[16:14:25] <nikio_> what do you mean?  i told you already
[16:14:30] <amundir> are you doing cookie.domain = "foo.com" ?
[16:14:46] <nikio_> nope im not setting anything like that anywhere
[16:14:54] <amundir> try setting the domain to the global domain
[16:15:23] <robertmaxrees> https://stackoverflow.com/a/23086139/923919
[16:16:13] <nikio_> maybe its because of the silly Options requests that seen to be happening automatically before my actual GET requests
[16:16:19] <amundir> heh, i'm looking at our groovy code, so my syntax may be different
[16:16:20] <nikio_> maybe that messes something up
[16:16:28] <amundir> no, options always happens
[16:16:45] <robertmaxrees> ^ basically a preflight.
[16:16:46] <amundir> read that post robert shared
[16:16:58] <nikio_> i dont see it happening for my other request that do work
[16:17:47] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Preflight_request
[16:17:58] <robertmaxrees> something isn't getting set correctloy.
[16:18:02] <robertmaxrees> *correctly.
[16:19:50] <nikio_> thanks for the kind help, im gonna read those links and grind through all the possibilities again, CORS is probably one of the biggest waste of manhours in the webdevelopment world
[16:20:20] <amundir> it's really not
[16:20:34] <amundir> and once you get it configured you don't have to mess with it again
[16:21:06] <nikio_> i get the security threat it addresses, but still, this could probably be improved
[16:23:06] <robertmaxrees> there's a reason it's so specific and particular.
[16:26:18] <nikio_> i guess so
[16:26:46] <robertmaxrees> not giving people unfettered access to your banking information is pretty important.
[16:33:09] <nikio_> agreed
[16:38:28] <nikio_> mm if there would be a problems with the OPTION requests the browser would have printed an error
[16:38:36] <nikio_> the only problem is that the cookie doesnt get sent
[16:39:23] <robertmaxrees> but you said the requests that are failing aren't sending options requests right?
[16:39:29] <nikio_> they are
[16:39:47] <robertmaxrees> ah, and the ones not sending options are the ones that succeed?
[16:39:52] <nikio_> the ones that are not failing are not sending OPTION requests
[16:40:11] <robertmaxrees> yeah, something about that seems funky to me.
[16:40:46] <robertmaxrees> unless the ones not sending options requests are the authentication requests.
[16:40:49] <amundir> So what logic are you performing on an OPTION request?
[16:44:11] <nikio_> no its one that goes to /isloggedin
[16:44:18] <nikio_> to check if the user is logged in
[16:44:25] <nikio_> if not, it redirects to the login page
[16:44:36] <nikio_> i made an SPA
[16:44:45] <nikio_> so i use javascript for everything, not php
[16:45:14] <nikio_> and that call sends the cookie
[16:45:17] <nikio_> i.e. it works
[16:45:40] <nikio_> its on the same page as the wfs calls that dont send the cookie
[16:47:13] <nikio_> amundir, im not performing any logic
[16:48:30] <amundir> hmm, well.  when we get an options request, we set three headers on the response; Access-Control-Allow-Methods, Access-Control-Allow-Headers, and Access-Control-Max-Age.  And we also set the response code to 200
[16:48:39] <amundir> I dunno how much that translates to php though
[16:52:08] <nikio_> amundir, this is my vhost definition: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/b123327a90006503c5d95af0c3a69c67
[16:52:14] <nikio_> i made a bit neat and changed the urls
[16:53:18] <amundir> one sec
[16:53:28] <robertmaxrees> i gotta ask: what's with the port swapping?
[16:53:33] <robertmaxrees> why not just leave this all on port 80?
[16:53:47] <amundir> we have our allow headers as "origin, content-type, accept"
[16:53:54] <amundir> but all you have is authorization
[16:54:22] <nikio_> because we make calls to 443.. 80 is not secure
[16:54:47] <amundir> try adding those three values to your allow headers and see if anything changes
[16:55:35] <nikio_> 80 is only there to force/guide people who are trying 80 onto 443
[16:55:48] <robertmaxrees> ah, for the https support.
[16:56:00] <nikio_> yes
[16:56:04] <nikio_> 443 is https
[16:56:12] <robertmaxrees> right,
[17:01:44] <nikio_> now im sending: Access-Control-Allow-Headers:authorization, origin, content-type, accept
[17:02:03] <amundir> on the ajax?
[17:02:26] <amundir> or did you edit that config file you linked?
[17:03:42] <nikio_> i edited the config file
[17:03:47] <amundir> k
[17:03:53] <nikio_> i ment me, the server, not me  the client :)
[17:04:16] <amundir> i dunno if you need a restart for that to take effect, but give that a go
[17:04:25] <nikio_> yes you always need to restart
[17:04:30] <amundir> (y)
[17:04:42] <nikio_> apache  loads the config and then keeps it untill the next restart
[17:05:02] <amundir> ^ should have been a thumbs up.  but my irc client doesn't show it
[17:14:27] <nikio_> ive noticed that the non--working requests send and origin header with  http://dev.foo.com  and a referer  header with http://dev.foo.com/
[17:14:44] <nikio_> the referer header url has  a trailing slash
[17:14:57] <amundir> so that wouldn't work because it is http
[17:15:03] <nikio_> sry
[17:15:08] <nikio_> https:// both of them
[17:15:18] <nikio_> its just the trailing slash thats weird
[17:17:20] <nikio_> they do work if i go there directly with the browser, just not with ajax
[17:17:46] <amundir> right, direct access doesn't suffer from cors restrictions
[17:24:12] <nikio_> ill just make to global functions and test them in the console, one the working request, the other the non working
[17:24:32] <nikio_> and keep making them look more like eachother till one stops/starts sending the cookie
[17:29:54] <nikio_> hmm ok so if i make the wfs request in to a global function and call it in the console it works
[17:39:22] <nikio_> ok
[17:39:26] <nikio_> shame on me
[17:39:43] <robertmaxrees> what was it?
[17:41:43] <nikio_> i wasnt using that javascript function i pasted before, i was passing the urls and letting  ol4 handle it.. there are many different layers and i forgot i didnt use my custom function for all of them
[17:42:00] <amundir> :o
[17:42:14] <nikio_> code wise it all looks very similar so i didnt notice it
[17:42:14] <robertmaxrees> heh
[17:43:02] <nikio_> didnt sleep well lately :s
[17:43:14] <nikio_> sry
[17:44:41] <nikio_> this is the library incase you are curious: https://openlayers.org/en/latest/examples/
[17:45:53] <nikio_> thx for the help, I learned from this experience
[17:46:03] <robertmaxrees> glad you figured it out.
[17:46:05] <amundir> all we can ask for
[17:56:34] <nikio_> all i had to do is h.withCredentials = true, where h is the xhr object used in the ol4 library code to make the requests
[17:56:49] <nikio_> and after I did that the option requests also stopped being sent
[17:59:18] <nikio_> so thats a hint for next time, .widthCredentials = true can prevent the browser from firing OPTION request before the GET request
[17:59:43] <robertmaxrees> options requests are pretty standard.  wonder what relation that has to the bug you were seeing.
[18:03:30] <nikio_> well this is what happened.. all i did is set the widthCredential property of the xhr object to true, after that the browser stopped sending OPTION requests
[18:03:41] <nikio_> so there is some interaction there
[18:04:02] <robertmaxrees> options requests are supposed to fire preflight for CORS iirc.
[18:04:16] <nikio_> it clearly gave reason to the browser to find OPTION request unnecessary
[18:05:09] <robertmaxrees> "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS#Functional_overview
[18:06:00] <robertmaxrees> some good info on that page about preflight with redirects, as well.
[18:07:23] <nikio_> gna go over that page, need to sharpen my knowledge on CORS
[18:09:45] <nikio_> bbl
