[03:28:23] <senecaty> has the .click() function ever been deprecated?
[03:52:24] <Cork> senecaty: no
[03:52:33] <Cork> senecaty: also .click has always just been a shorthand
[03:52:57] <Cork> .click(args) => .bind('click', args) (before) .on('click', args) now
[03:53:08] <Cork> .click() => .trigger('click')
[05:18:02] <senecaty> Cork: thanks
[05:18:09] <senecaty> jquery migrate emits a warning for it
[05:18:15] <senecaty> prematurely
[05:21:13] <Cork> senecaty: most cause they think it is "only four characters longer then on"
[05:21:24] <Cork> most likely cause*
[09:02:42] <AndresInSpace> what is the proper(eg, efficient) way to call an event without using trigger?
[09:02:57] <AndresInSpace> like say, i need to call functions based on a delayed windwo resize (debounced)
[09:04:13] <Cork> AndresInSpace: you mean native js way?
[09:04:18] <AndresInSpace> yea
[09:04:31] <AndresInSpace> well, that or if theres a better way in jquery as well
[09:04:43] <AndresInSpace> I am just asking as someone mentioned using .trigger is bad
[09:05:13] <Cork> AndresInSpace: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CustomEvent/CustomEvent#Example
[09:07:19] <AndresInSpace> mm thanks Cork
[09:07:26] <Cork> np
[10:53:19] <AndresInSpace> anyone in here familiar with prototype?
[10:53:34] <AndresInSpace> prototype.js* to clarify
[10:54:00] <robertmaxrees> lol
[10:54:09] <robertmaxrees> not really?  could try asking your question anyway.
[10:54:09] <AndresInSpace> ah hey robertmaxrees :)
[10:54:30] <AndresInSpace> Got a separate question for you , mind if i PM?
[10:54:47] <robertmaxrees> is it jquery related??
[10:54:54] <AndresInSpace> ye
[10:54:57] <AndresInSpace> well somewhat
[10:55:01] <robertmaxrees> then just ask in the channel?
[10:55:06] <robertmaxrees> :)
[10:55:15] <AndresInSpace> you mentioned last week to not use .throttle
[10:55:21] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[10:55:24] <AndresInSpace> err sorry
[10:55:26] <AndresInSpace> .trigger
[10:55:30] <robertmaxrees> oh, yeah.
[10:55:36] <robertmaxrees> sure lol
[10:55:57] <AndresInSpace> what is your alternative?
[10:56:08] <robertmaxrees> you call the function directly.
[10:56:10] <AndresInSpace> atm im using window.dispatchEvent(event) with custom event
[10:56:16] <robertmaxrees> so like
[10:56:29] <robertmaxrees> why are you dispatching events in the first place if what you want is to call a function?
[10:56:38] <AndresInSpace> delayed-resize event
[10:56:43] <robertmaxrees> ?
[10:57:03] <robertmaxrees> i'm going to guess you have a handler bound to the window resize, yeah?
[10:57:17] <AndresInSpace> yeah
[10:57:27] <robertmaxrees> so why do you need to fire an event to call that?
[10:57:46] <AndresInSpace> is just how it's setup lol
[10:57:55] <robertmaxrees> did you write the handler?
[10:57:58] <AndresInSpace> no,lol
[10:58:05] <robertmaxrees> what's the handler from?
[10:58:06] <AndresInSpace> am changing it around myself its native magento 1
[10:58:38] <robertmaxrees> got any docs for whatever it is?
[10:58:44] <AndresInSpace> basically you're just telling me to skip the event dispatch,, and just toss in the method calls directly
[10:58:50] <robertmaxrees> yes.
[10:58:52] <AndresInSpace> gotcha
[10:58:54] <AndresInSpace> thats doable
[10:59:02] <AndresInSpace> They did it this way i guess to make it more modular
[10:59:03] <robertmaxrees> don't proxy logic through the DOM
[10:59:36] <robertmaxrees> lots of libraries/frameworks provide ways to call that kind of stuff directly.  if they don't, there may very well be a legitimate reason.
[10:59:43] <AndresInSpace> also assuming they did this cause some people wouldn't be editing the files directly and probably writing js in CMS
[10:59:55] <robertmaxrees> erm
[11:00:16] <robertmaxrees> you're not editing the framework's files directly, right?
[11:00:24] <AndresInSpace> no lol
[11:00:43] <AndresInSpace> I am very familiar with Magento
[11:00:47] <AndresInSpace> no worries there
[11:00:54] <robertmaxrees> just makin' sure heh
[11:01:15] <AndresInSpace> You just made me wonder if there was an alternative way to call events, or like .trigger was depreciated or something lol
[11:01:40] <robertmaxrees> nope.  just call functions directly instead of proxying through the DOM :)
[11:01:54] <AndresInSpace> :P
[11:01:57] <AndresInSpace> will do
[11:02:17] <AndresInSpace> just gotta remember to add them method calls to this file with the scroll event
[11:02:21] <AndresInSpace> and resize event
[11:02:37] <robertmaxrees> rad
[11:02:56] <robertmaxrees> oh and make sure you're minimizing things like dom lookups within those handlers if you're doing any.
[11:03:00] <AndresInSpace> wondering if theres an easier way to apply them wihtout needing me to edit that file as well
[11:03:19] <robertmaxrees> what file?
[11:03:54] <AndresInSpace> I mean like, my resize event is in app.js and im adding some js specific to PDP in a template.. without editing app.js how to add that new method call into resize event
[11:04:02] <AndresInSpace> :P
[11:04:24] <AndresInSpace> array of methods, check an execute each? maybe
[11:04:30] <robertmaxrees> yikes - no.
[11:04:37] <AndresInSpace> that just screams eval issues
[11:04:42] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[11:04:50] <robertmaxrees> wouldn't be eval issues.
[11:05:04] <AndresInSpace> ah by reference, i was thinking as string
[11:05:06] <robertmaxrees> sounds like you need to create a utils file that you can call.
[11:05:40] <robertmaxrees> window.someGlobalName.resizeHandler = function() { console.log('foo') };
[11:06:08] <AndresInSpace> hmm object references and call object each ref?
[11:06:25] <AndresInSpace> think i see what you're getting at
[11:06:28] <robertmaxrees> i'd need to see your code because it sounds like you're overc0mplicting it./
[11:06:33] <robertmaxrees> *overcomplicating
[11:06:55] <AndresInSpace> well its an entire ecommerce system ran on magento 1.9x
[11:07:05] <AndresInSpace> lots of code :p
[11:07:07] <robertmaxrees> i'm familiar with magento
[11:07:12] <robertmaxrees> and that's not what i'm asking for.
[11:07:17] <robertmaxrees> but okie :)
[11:08:25] <AndresInSpace> not sure what code youre asking for tbh, im knees deep in rebuild/redesign
[11:10:05] <AndresInSpace> wasn't really being specific about one block im workign on, in general I know i am going to have several methods to call from this event
[11:10:24] <AndresInSpace> so just being prepare how i should do it, modifying the existing JS in theme so its more efficient
[11:10:32] <AndresInSpace> thanks robertmaxrees  :)
[11:11:45] <AndresInSpace> oh and my prototype question was the methods it extends on the Event object, to the event target elm, does that kill performance?..
[11:12:09] <AndresInSpace> as it seems like theres 30+ events attached to this elm but its only one, with everything else as an extended method from Event obj
[11:12:24] <AndresInSpace> curtesy of prototype.js
[11:12:28] <AndresInSpace> courtesy *
[11:15:00] <robertmaxrees> prototype is bad in general.  extending core objects is a big no-no
[11:15:17] <robertmaxrees> there's a reason nobody uses it any more ;)
[11:16:49] <robertmaxrees> i'd worry less about perf and more about readability in your case.
[11:18:07] <AndresInSpace> cant get rid of it,baked in core part of magento 1
[11:18:18] <AndresInSpace> but k
[11:18:23] <robertmaxrees> i woudln't rely on it at all.
[11:18:28] <robertmaxrees> in your code, at least.
[11:18:30] <AndresInSpace> yeah im not trying to
[11:18:43] <robertmaxrees> and i'd upgrade your magento install asap :)
[11:18:51] <AndresInSpace> i just know that it does some method extending when you attach an event listener to an elm
[11:19:10] <robertmaxrees> it also extends base prototypes./
[11:19:24] <AndresInSpace> can't use m2
[11:19:28] <robertmaxrees> :|
[11:19:36] <AndresInSpace> limitations of ERP, integrations, etc, etc
[11:19:52] <robertmaxrees> that's... scary heh
[11:20:09] <AndresInSpace> eh? its up to date and patched with all security patche
[11:20:21] <robertmaxrees> and it still uses things like prototype ;)
[11:20:29] <AndresInSpace> lol
[11:20:37] <robertmaxrees> iirc magento is dropping support middle of next year.
[11:20:43] <AndresInSpace> i know
[11:20:45] <AndresInSpace> 2020
[11:20:47] <robertmaxrees> and those kinds of migrations are always a pain
[11:20:58] <AndresInSpace> they were dropping support back in 2017
[11:21:00] <AndresInSpace> lmfao
[11:21:03] <robertmaxrees> something to think about 2.24.24) Quit (Ping timeout: 258 seconds)
[11:21:04] <robertmaxrees> [2019:02:18:08:18:09] <AndresInSpace> cant get rid of it,baked in core part of magento 1
[11:21:04] <robertmaxrees> [2019:02:18:08:18:20] <AndresInSpace> but k
[11:21:04] <robertmaxrees> [2019:02:18:08:18:25] <robertmaxrees> i woudln't rely on it at all.
[11:21:04] <robertmaxrees> [2019:02:18:08:18:30] <robertmaxrees> in your code, at least.
[11:21:04] <robertmaxrees> [2019:02:18:08:18:32] <AndresInSpace> yeah im not trying to
[11:21:04] <robertmaxrees> [2019:02:18:08:18:39] * ^esc_ (~esc-ape@77.119.130.245.
[11:21:07] <robertmaxrees> wtf
[11:21:11] <robertmaxrees> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[11:21:12] <AndresInSpace> halp
[11:21:13] <robertmaxrees> welp
[11:21:26] <robertmaxrees> anyway
[11:21:30] <AndresInSpace> someones cat walked across their keyboard
[11:21:32] <AndresInSpace> <_<
[11:21:39] <robertmaxrees> nah, misclick on my part heh
[11:21:57] <robertmaxrees> the one feature of mirc that i hate
[14:20:10] <yanchai_> hi everyone
[14:20:20] <robertmaxrees> hello
[14:20:50] <yanchai_> i am having trouble with dropdown menu :(
[14:20:57] <robertmaxrees> bummer
[14:22:56] <yanchai_> i am using this code to display another drop down menu based on the selected category which is also a dropdown menu
[14:23:03] <yanchai_> https://prnt.sc/mmuati
[14:23:10] <robertmaxrees> :(
[14:23:13] <robertmaxrees> make a fiddle pls.
[14:23:18] <robertmaxrees> screenshots of text are... weird lol
[14:23:26] <yanchai_> ok
[14:28:27] <robertmaxrees> >.>
[14:29:39] <robertmaxrees> yanchai_ i was mostly just asking for something like https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/xpLh4c2u/
[14:32:06] <yanchai_> https://jsfiddle.net/yanchai/cep58rx6/4/
[14:32:21] <robertmaxrees> alright.
[14:32:33] <yanchai_> i am trying to repeat the dropdown but the second doesnt work :(
[14:33:21] <robertmaxrees> so like - sports isn't working?
[14:33:30] <yanchai_> i want to add more than 1 hobbies so i repeat the dropdown
[14:33:45] <robertmaxrees> which dropdown?
[14:33:54] <yanchai_> i mean it should have more than 1 sports hobbies
[14:34:06] <yanchai_> the 3rd one
[14:34:08] <robertmaxrees> can you update the fiddle to show what you mean?
[14:34:13] <yanchai_> ok
[14:34:39] <yanchai_> https://jsfiddle.net/yanchai/cep58rx6/5/
[14:34:59] <robertmaxrees> oh
[14:35:02] <robertmaxrees> you can't repeat IDs.
[14:35:08] <robertmaxrees> you can only use an ID once per page.
[14:35:13] <yanchai_> oh
[14:35:27] <yanchai_> is there a way to enable the user to add more than 1 hobbie?
[14:35:45] <yanchai_> if he clicks the add more category button
[14:35:49] <robertmaxrees> you mean have multiple hobby-selectors?
[14:35:57] <yanchai_> yes
[14:36:01] <robertmaxrees> use a class instead.
[14:37:24] <yanchai_> oh ok let me try
[14:39:53] <yanchai_> still doent work on the second time
[14:39:57] <robertmaxrees> show me?>
[14:40:19] <yanchai_> wait let me update my fiddle
[14:45:24] <yanchai_> sir can i do a screenshot i dont know how to explain this :)
[14:45:43] <robertmaxrees> show me what you have so far in the fiddle.
[14:45:50] <robertmaxrees> screenshots are mostly useless heh.
[14:46:14] <yanchai_> https://prnt.sc/mmumzc
[14:46:43] <robertmaxrees> i like how i just said to show me what you have so far in the fiddle and that screenshots are mostly useless and you ignored all of that.
[14:47:10] <robertmaxrees> lol bold strategy
[14:48:41] <robertmaxrees> are you fully adding new elements to the page?
[14:49:05] <robertmaxrees> if so, read http://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/ and http://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events
[14:49:06] <yanchai_> https://jsfiddle.net/yanchai/cep58rx6/12/
[14:49:12] <robertmaxrees> and get rid of duplicate Ids
[14:49:23] <yanchai_> i updated my fiddle sir
[14:49:29] <robertmaxrees> ah, yeah/.
[14:49:35] <robertmaxrees> look at the links i sent.
[14:51:50] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/26uypnj5/3/ btw
[14:51:55] <robertmaxrees> your issue was that massive template
[14:51:55] <yanchai_> oh this one is cleaner sir check this out
[14:52:03] <yanchai_> https://jsfiddle.net/yanchai/cep58rx6/15/
[14:52:03] <robertmaxrees> lol "sir"
[14:52:13] <yanchai_> ohh
[14:52:29] <robertmaxrees> you need delegated listeners and to not duplicate IDs
[14:52:54] <yanchai_> do you have links for that sir? im newbie :)
[14:53:05] <robertmaxrees> i already sent them.
[14:53:12] <robertmaxrees> and please stop calling me sir lol
[14:53:21] <yanchai_> ok thanks
[14:53:29] <yanchai_> sorry for that ^^
[14:53:34] <robertmaxrees> it's alright.
[15:08:30] <yanchai_> this looks so hard :(
[15:09:13] <yanchai_> i just want to have the option to add more hobbies if the button is clicked
[15:13:08] <robertmaxrees> it's really simple :)
[15:13:16] <robertmaxrees> where are you getting stuck?
[15:14:20] <yanchai_> this sir https://jsfiddle.net/yanchai/cep58rx6/15/
[15:14:32] <robertmaxrees> lol the sir thing is weird ;)
[15:14:54] <robertmaxrees> okay so again
[15:15:12] <robertmaxrees> you can only use each ID once per page.
[15:15:20] <robertmaxrees> so you need to change hobby-selector to be a class.
[15:15:29] <robertmaxrees> and then you combine that with a delegated listener.
[15:15:39] <yanchai_> sorry for calling you sir
[15:15:54] <yanchai_> ok let me try again :)
[15:18:02] <robertmaxrees> here let me simplify it for you
[15:18:03] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/2vuLpk6y/
[15:18:27] <robertmaxrees> so in this example, the first link will always work, right?
[15:18:56] <robertmaxrees> but if you add any others, they won't work, right?
[15:19:38] <robertmaxrees> yanchai_ ^
[15:21:37] <yanchai_> yes
[15:22:01] <robertmaxrees> that's because you can't bind handlers to elements that don't exist at the time of binding.
[15:22:08] <robertmaxrees> so instead you use a delegated listener.
[15:22:33] <robertmaxrees> that looks like this: https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/2vuLpk6y/2/
[15:22:40] <yanchai_> ok
[15:22:45] <robertmaxrees> make sense?
[15:23:27] <yanchai_> oh ok
[15:23:32] <yanchai_> hahaha thanks
[15:23:35] <robertmaxrees> heh.
[15:23:43] <robertmaxrees> the links explain it in more detail.
[15:24:24] <yanchai_> thanks
[16:22:17] <znf> In the case of <label>Text<input id="id"></label> - how do I change the label text without affecting the input?
[16:23:10] <znf> considering I have idField = $('input#id') assigned to it?
[16:23:49] <znf> idField.parent().text('stuff') seems to destroy the input element
[16:25:15] <robertmaxrees> you'll need to either find that specific textNode or just wrap the label text in a span or something.
[16:25:41] <znf> uhm, so... idField.parent().contents().filter(function(){ return this.nodeType == 3; }).first().replaceWith('text')
[16:25:41] <znf> ?
[16:25:54] <robertmaxrees> something like that.
[16:26:01] <znf> any way to make it shorter?
[16:26:15] <robertmaxrees> not really.
[16:26:18] <znf> or, rather, reusable?
[16:26:24] <robertmaxrees> reusable how?
[16:26:28] <robertmaxrees> also: don't prepend ID selectors with the tagName :)
[16:27:07] <znf> as in, I I have more than one label to replace it's text, based on more than one inputs
[16:27:19] <robertmaxrees> could use .each()
[16:27:33] <robertmaxrees> but without more of an example, it's hard to offer more advice :)
[16:27:35] <znf> yeah, I'm not doing that, just wrote it as an example
[16:28:35] <robertmaxrees> dunno what to tell ya :)
[16:29:33] <pavonia> Why do you even put the input into the label? Seems like you are making your life harder than necessary
[16:29:51] <robertmaxrees> pavonia that's actually pretty common.
[16:29:56] <robertmaxrees> removes the need for the for attribute.
[16:30:23] <pavonia> Yeah, I've seen it too
[16:30:30] <znf> pavonia, don't have much control over the markup itself
[16:30:47] <pavonia> I see
[16:31:38] <znf> this: https://jsfiddle.net/3vqa0fcx/
[16:32:04] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[16:32:10] <robertmaxrees> easy enough to abstract that out

[17:28:11] <harbinder> Hi.  I am having trouble getting my JQuery-Ajax promise chain to fail and stop executing when there is a failure.  How can I get my chain to stop executing when there is a failure?  Thank you!
[17:29:36] <robertmaxrees> can you show us what you've tried?
[17:36:25] <robertmaxrees> wekp
[17:36:30] <robertmaxrees> *welp
[17:43:07] <yanchai_> hi robertmaxrees
[17:43:27] <robertmaxrees> ?
[17:43:44] <yanchai_> is there a sample code with the same logic that i want to implement?
[17:44:07] <yanchai_> im really having a hard time with multiple hobbies :(
[17:44:37] <robertmaxrees> i sent you an example?
[17:44:42] <robertmaxrees> show me your latest.
[17:44:46] <harbinder> robertmaxrees: thank you! https://pastebin.com/Up6xYR8T
[17:45:32] <robertmaxrees> harbinder why not use promises? .then() and .catch()?
[17:45:43] <robertmaxrees> also: how are you throwing your errors?
[17:46:26] <harbinder> Please slow down.  I know of bluebird but this is different and I'm not sure I understand how it works.
[17:46:39] <robertmaxrees> jquery promises are just like bluebird.
[17:46:44] <harbinder> Are you talking about the caller or the promise object?
[17:46:51] <robertmaxrees> use .then() instead of .done() and .catch() instead of fail()
[17:48:01] <robertmaxrees> harbinder also: what does someOtherFunction() do here?  does it return a function?
[17:48:06] <harbinder> The reason I am using done and catch in the promise object is because I want to handle the situation where the promise fails.
[17:48:33] <harbinder> It's another promise that gets called only if the first one succeeds.
[17:48:45] <robertmaxrees> lol
[17:48:51] <harbinder> ?
[17:48:53] <robertmaxrees> harbinder .then() and .catch() will work.
[17:49:04] <robertmaxrees> use them instead - it's a promise, so use the compliant handlers for those cases.
[17:49:15] <harbinder> But I am using THEN.
[17:49:30] <robertmaxrees> i mean on the ajax call as well.
[17:49:32] <harbinder> The caller is calling THEN,
[17:49:54] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/xapjq3st/2/ like this.
[17:49:58] <robertmaxrees> to make things more consistent.
[17:50:53] <robertmaxrees> so when you say "the chain DOES NOT execute" in your code, could you clarify?
[17:51:35] <robertmaxrees> do you mean if any .then() throws an error, you want that catch-all?
[17:51:46] <harbinder> The second promise in the chain is not called if the first one fails.
[17:52:19] <harbinder> Can this all be done by the caller instead of changing the promise object?
[17:52:42] <robertmaxrees> you can just return the ajax call, yeah
[17:53:06] <yanchai_> robert what i mean is everytime i click the add more hobbies button a new dropdown menu will display and once you select a category on that dropdown another dropdown list will display
[17:53:24] <harbinder> Actually, what I meant is that the chain NO LONGER continues to execute.
[17:54:52] <robertmaxrees> harbinder so once a then throws an error, don't execute subsequent then calls?
[17:55:04] <robertmaxrees> yanchai_ show me your progresss.
[17:55:39] <harbinder> well as I understand, once a promise is rejected, do not call "then" or another promise.
[17:55:49] <robertmaxrees> "or another promise"?????
[17:56:03] <robertmaxrees> i'm just trying to understand what you're trying to accomplish :)
[17:56:06] <harbinder> Yes, the second promise is called someotherfunction.
[17:56:20] <harbinder> fair enough, thanks.  No worries.
[17:56:35] <robertmaxrees> so is someOtherFunction() returning a new promise?
[17:56:36] <robertmaxrees> or....
[17:57:18] <robertmaxrees> because the way you have that written is going to run sometherFunction and assign its return to the .then()
[18:01:23] <robertmaxrees> welp
