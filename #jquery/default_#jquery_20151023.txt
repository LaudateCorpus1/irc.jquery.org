[00:59:46] <BustyLoliChan> I'm trying to resize the text size of an inner div to fit it's outer div
[01:20:43] <BustyLoliChan> also does anyone know why my query text looks anti aliased?
[02:38:32] <hellyeah> is there any function or jquery that splits string "multiple characters" my example is here. I want to remove | and = https://jsfiddle.net/9jdp7ojm/2/

[03:05:38] <Logicgate> hey guys
[03:05:42] <hellyeah> yo
[03:05:46] <Logicgate> I'm running production version 1.13
[03:06:00] <Logicgate> and it seems as if $.ajax calls are painfully slow on an iphone for whatever reason
[03:06:10] <Logicgate> Tried googling for bugs about that but can't find anything.
[03:06:21] <Logicgate> using cache: false as well..
[03:35:31] <hellyeah> why it didnt change every = it just changed the first one https://jsfiddle.net/9jdp7ojm/31/
[04:04:28] <sebb> hi ! Got a quick question, Ive got a form with file input
[04:04:38] <sebb> how can I display files that I have just picked to be uploaded
[04:05:00] <sebb> I mean in my form I press "browse" and before I make submit
[04:05:04] <sebb> I would like to display it's name
[04:05:10] <sebb> how is it possible ?
[04:10:00] <Cork> sebb: that should be accessible through inputElement.value
[04:10:35] <Cork> if you want to show a thumbnail or something more advanced you would have to use the file api (inputElement.files)
[04:21:34] <Rnold> hi, how can i send data to the server when the user click on button using ajax? here is my simple ajax: http://hastebin.com/umocineteh.xml
[04:39:34] <Cork> Rnold: bind a click handler on the button and call $.post/$.get to the resource you want to contact
[04:43:14] <Rnold> Cork, i've found this function: http://hastebin.com/umeyozekog.tex but i dont have demo_test.asp file, i only want to post it to some ip
[04:43:42] <Cork> Rnold: you can't post to an ip
[04:43:43] <Rnold> can i replace the file with the ip address?
[04:43:49] <Rnold> oh
[04:43:56] <Cork> http works with resources
[04:44:03] <Cork> and a resource has to respond to the request
[04:44:21] <Cork> so you have some form of script server side that responds to the call
[04:44:32] <Rnold> yep i have
[04:44:35] <Rnold> but no file
[04:44:36] <Cork> .php, .asp, .what ever
[04:44:42] <Cork> it doesn't have to be a file
[04:44:45] <Cork> just an url
[04:44:48] <Rnold> its esp8266 module
[04:44:55] <Cork> (that is why i called it a resource)
[04:45:35] <Rnold> ill try this
[05:21:40] <Rnold> Cork, i have this script: http://hastebin.com/xujosamoja.xml i'de like to make buttons send their value without refreshing the page,how can i achive this? help please
[05:23:13] <lenswipee> Rnold: read up on ajax.
[05:23:22] <Uhkis> ?api ajax
[05:23:22] <b-ot> we got dat
[05:23:37] <Uhkis> ffs b-ot :-D

[05:29:20] <Uhkis> whatever you want it to be :)
[05:31:17] <JosefDe> Hi guys. I'm desperate
[05:31:31] <JosefDe> ($(window).scrollTop() + 60) returns in some case "301" and in some case "602" (double)
[05:31:37] <JosefDe> How can I fix this?
[05:32:46] <JosefDe> It confuses me like hell
[05:33:02] <JosefDe> The interesting phanomen is this:
[05:33:07] <JosefDe> I'm including 2 javascript-files
[05:33:17] <JosefDe> Each of them contain the same ($(window).scrollTop() + 60) instruction
[05:33:30] <JosefDe> If I remove this instruction from second file, I get wrong position (602)
[05:35:56] <Rnold> can i use post like this:  <button type="button" class="btn btn-info" onclick="$.post( "test.php" );">testbutton</button> ?
[05:50:17] <JosefDe> anyone an idea?
[05:51:16] <robhol> JosefDe: try making a jsfiddle or something that demonstrates it
[05:51:34] <Xatenev> jira
[05:51:44] <JosefDe> that's not possible, as I told you that this only happens if I remove the code from one of the javascript-files. I can't reproduce it
[05:57:05] <vol4ko> what effect is this http://www.audaxbike.com/ when you scroll down, its a single page ( the homepage ) and have different full height section, they have some kind of effect that prevent fast scrolling. Is there are any library available to obtain this?
[06:10:59] <robhol> this might just be me being old-fashioned, but, don't
[06:11:06] <robhol> sites that fuck with scrolling are annoying :p
[06:17:10] <Cork> robhol: i agree, but hey that is what killing scroll events are for :)
[06:17:17] <JosefDe> can someone help me?
[06:17:26] <JosefDe> How can I get scrollTop position of a parent-object?
[06:17:37] <Cork> uh
[06:17:47] <Cork> you grab the parent element and scrollTop?
[06:18:58] <JosefDe> Cork: What I want is: The distance of the current scroll position to the parent
[06:19:23] <JosefDe> Cork: So if I click a <a>-tag inside a div. I want to find out, how far "<a>" is away from it's parent div
[06:19:48] <Cork> JosefDe: you can't really do that easily
[06:20:07] <Cork> the best solution is to make that parent an offset parent by setting it to position: relative/absolute/fixed
[06:20:19] <Cork> then you can do .position().top on the a tag
[06:20:57] <JosefDe> ok. Let me try that
[06:23:13] <JosefDe> Cork: It says: $(...).position(...).top is not a function
[06:23:23] <JosefDe> oh..
[06:23:24] <JosefDe> I see
[06:23:51] <Cork> JosefDe: $ isn't jquery in that case
[06:24:04] <JosefDe> Cork: Yeah. The problem was top() instead of top
[06:24:09] <Cork> ah
[06:24:15] <Cork> anyway afk
[06:29:35] <JosefDe> Cork: One question left
[06:29:41] <JosefDe> Cork: Do you have time
[07:05:46] <JosefDe_> can anyone help me?
[07:06:36] <JosefDe_> I have an <div>-element. I want to show a popup in this div, depending in which scroll-position I'm currently in. How can I achieve this?
[07:34:15] <hellyeah> hey
[07:34:50] <hellyeah> i just want to replace , to | but it puts , to everywhere? Can you help me to find out what it happened?
[07:34:53] <hellyeah> https://jsfiddle.net/9jdp7ojm/44/
[07:38:45] <hellyeah> i just want to replace , to | but it puts , to everywhere? Can you help me to find out what it happened?  https://jsfiddle.net/9jdp7ojm/44/
[07:38:49] <hellyeah> ops
[07:53:58] <taplar> hellyeah: | looks to be a special character.  escape it
[07:54:33] <taplar> or put it in brackets
[07:55:04] <hellyeah> taplar yes i did that
[07:55:27] <hellyeah> taplar: that doesnt seem like json string https://jsfiddle.net/9jdp7ojm/49/
[07:56:07] <taplar> what do you mean?
[07:56:33] <Kartagis> https://jsfiddle.net/kartagis/9jdp7ojm/50/
[07:56:50] <hellyeah> taplar: as far as i know it should look like {....}
[07:56:55] <hellyeah> there is no curly brace
[07:57:02] <taplar> not the way your doing it
[07:57:11] <taplar> why are you putting data in the name field?
[07:57:37] <hellyeah> actually there is name of button
[07:57:46] <Kartagis> http://paste.debian.net/317592/ <--- why are my images with the class otherpicture getting ids that I already have on the DOM?
[07:57:51] <hellyeah> i want to convert it into json to give thise as parameter to the method
[07:58:07] <taplar> hellyeah: store the data in a data-* attribute, not name
[07:58:42] <taplar> or if your wanting them to submit with a form, put the data in hidden elements
[07:58:53] <hellyeah> ah okey i can store in data
[07:59:40] <hellyeah> taplar: my aim is like when you click the button it will get this string from data atr of button and send it to method as parameter with ajax call
[07:59:59] <hellyeah> i just succeded to call backend method with ajax call method has parameters
[08:00:02] <taplar> ok, data fields would work for that
[08:00:22] <hellyeah> i guess i need json string to send parameters to the method
[08:00:37] <hellyeah> my method has threew parameters project_name, environment and frontend
[08:00:59] <taplar> so store those in three data elements
[08:01:16] <hellyeah> so i should have {project_name : foo, environment : blah, frontend : zlah}
[08:01:19] <hellyeah> iw ill do that
[08:02:57] <taplar> uh, not sure what your meaning
[08:03:06] <hellyeah> just a sec
[08:03:17] <taplar> you'd have data-project-name="" data-environment="" data-frontend=""
[08:03:25] <taplar> later if you want to construct a json object with those you can
[08:04:31] <hellyeah> i guess i need to have this data in js
[08:04:32] <hellyeah> var dto = JSON.stringify({ project_name: "SearchEngine" , environment: "Prod", frontend : "Monitor" });
[08:06:04] <taplar> ajax calls can take objects.  you don't necessarily have to stringify it.  jquery can handle that for you
[08:08:03] <hellyeah> you mean like that  var dto =  project_name = "SearchEngine", environment = "Prod", frontend = "Monitor";
[08:11:45] <taplar> huh?
[08:16:06] <hellyeah> anyway
[08:16:17] <arup_r> I was reading js file to fix a issue. But I don't understand what $el means here. Any help what does it mean? https://gist.github.com/aruprakshit/0fdcdb093e64f52ba152#file-player-js-L163
[08:27:30] <PCatinean> How do I say in jquery if $(this) is a option tag and has class x ?
[08:28:19] <taplar> $(this).filter('option.x')
[08:30:00] <PCatinean> thank you taplar
[08:36:55] <Cork> PCatinean: .is
[08:37:04] <Cork> .filter will have to use .length
[08:37:23] <taplar> true
[08:37:26] <Cork> if($(this).is('option.x')) {}
[08:38:04] <ozcanesen> can i use jquery.when for regular functions which contains ajax calls?
[08:38:24] <Cork> ozcanesen: yes, if you return the xhr object from the function
[08:38:52] <Cork> function test() { return $.ajax(); }; $.when(test())
[08:39:27] <ozcanesen> Cork: what if there are two calls in that function?
[08:39:35] <ozcanesen> should i put when also in function?
[08:39:56] <Cork> ozcanesen: you could combine them with a $.when ya
[08:40:04] <ozcanesen> Cork: thank you
[08:40:14] <PCatinean> If I loop over a list of option elements how do I determine in the loop if that element is the last option of the select it belongs to
[08:40:15] <PCatinean> ?
[08:40:44] <Cork> PCatinean: you would have to store the selection before you loop it
[08:41:23] <Cork> var options = $('option'), len = options.length; options.each(function(i) { if(i == len-1) {} });
[08:42:39] <PCatinean> I see, thanks
[08:44:14] <PCatinean> and to check element type use prop('name smth')
[08:45:43] <Cork> no
[08:45:50] <Cork> you could use prop('tagName') if you want
[08:46:00] <Cork> but .is is prob the cleanest
[08:47:21] <PCatinean> .is('select') ?
[08:47:26] <PCatinean> yeah good point
[08:48:05] <Cork> note don't use that for checked
[08:48:23] <Cork> (that always makes me cry when i see ppl doing it...)
[08:48:29] <PCatinean> haha :))) why's that
[08:48:31] <Cork> $(this).is(':checked') :/
[08:48:43] <Cork> this.checked gives the exact same result
[08:48:52] <Cork> just with a lot less work
[08:48:57] <Cork> and even less characters
[08:49:14] <taplar> i'm still in the phase of actively breaking myself of that
[08:50:39] <PCatinean> :)))
[08:50:42] <PCatinean> noted
[08:57:56] <naftilos76> Hi everyone, this is a little weird but i d like your opinion. Supposing that i want to automate an object initialized with 2 keys having the same name like this: var tmp = { one: 1, one: "1clone" } . Is there a way to automatically  or dynamically set the keys' values so that they are different to each other like adding a s/n at their right most side to look like { one_1: 1, one_2: "1clone" } . Is this doable?
[08:59:08] <Cork> naftilos76: you can't have an object with the same key existing twice
[08:59:15] <Cork> naftilos76: the second instance will overwrite the first
[08:59:37] <Cork> so you can't recover that except reading the declaration source as text and then handling that
[09:00:29] <naftilos76> Cork, i am very aware of that . However i have encountered a condition where i have to use the same keys in two or more cases
[09:00:42] <Cork> naftilos76: then you can't use an object
[09:00:55] <Cork> what i say that is cause it can't store the info
[09:00:59] <Cork> *why
[09:01:36] <naftilos76> Cork, you are right. I m just exploring options than rewriting code :)
[09:01:49] <Cork> naftilos76: you could have an array on the key
[09:01:57] <Cork> { one: [] }
[09:02:31] <PCatinean> Cork, maybe you can help me on this one: http://hastebin.com/etefeguken.coffee
[09:02:51] <PCatinean> I loop through the options of a select with a certain class and all input with that class
[09:03:03] <PCatinean> The difference is that with the select I have to loop over the options not the tags themselves
[09:03:33] <PCatinean> And I have to disable the select field if the only option that is not hidden is the default one that is empty
[09:03:50] <PCatinean> And re-enable it otherwise.All my method are somewhat inefficient
[09:04:00] <PCatinean> Not sure what the smoothest approach would be
[09:06:51] <Cork> PCatinean: i would prob do that completely reverse
[09:07:14] <Cork> i would construct an attribute selector of onchange_vals
[09:07:14] <PCatinean> how's that?
[09:07:20] <Cork> and then filter out the options matching
[09:07:31] <Cork> and just setting disabled on all of them in one go
[09:07:35] <Cork> much less code that way
[09:08:08] <Cork> (and much less nested ifs)
[09:08:49] <Cork> uh, wait you have options selected as inputs??
[09:09:00] <Cork> that variable name is really wrong
[09:09:39] <Cork> PCatinean: also i would replace .parent().parent() with .closest()
[09:09:47] <PCatinean> let me go with what you just said
[09:09:54] <Cork> less fragile and much more readable
[09:09:54] <PCatinean> Construct attribute selector of onchange_vals
[09:10:27] <zline> is there an easy way to get base64 encoded string from an img div?
[09:10:44] <Cork> PCatinean: also note you can't hide options with a class, it isn't cross browser compatible
[09:10:45] <PCatinean> The idea is that the entire form must be sent to the server so it can study the options selected and return what possible options can be elected
[09:11:03] <PCatinean> damn, had no idea, how else?
[09:11:04] <Cork> the only way to cross browser hide an option entry is to actively remove it from it
[09:11:13] <PCatinean> pssshh
[09:11:17] <PCatinean> that makes things a lot more complicated
[09:11:21] <Cork> (chrome goes bonkers if you don't)
[09:11:26] <Cork> i know
[09:11:52] <PCatinean> I'm using chromium for development
[09:11:56] <PCatinean> hmmmm
[09:11:59] <PCatinean> wow, this is such a pain
[09:12:12] <Cork> if you hide it in a none remove way it will leave an empty space in chrome
[09:12:26] <Cork> at least in like chrome 29, haven't tested since
[09:12:47] <Cork> i just marked display: none as not web compatible and moved on :)
[09:14:46] <PCatinean> Cork, but there will always be a empty option at least in the selection
[09:15:23] <Cork> PCatinean: i meant the space where the option would be in the dropdown will still be taken
[09:15:27] <Cork> but with empty space
[09:15:31] <PCatinean> ughhh
[09:15:38] <PCatinean> that's so silly though :(
[09:15:59] <Cork> opps
[09:16:04] <PCatinean> either way before that, I'm trying to figure out how you said with the selector
[09:16:14] <Cork> i hate when i mistakenly type ctrl+w in the irc client -_-'
[09:16:22] <PCatinean> I do that too a lot...
[09:17:05] <Kartagis> can I get base64 encoded string only from a canvas?
[09:18:14] <Cork> PCatinean: .filter('[value="' + onchange_vals['value_ids'].join('"],[value="') + '"]').closest(
[09:18:17] <Cork> opps
[09:18:36] <Cork> PCatinean: .filter('[value="' + onchange_vals['value_ids'].join('"],[value="') + '"]').closest('select').prop('disabled', true);
[09:18:38] <Cork> something like that
[09:18:57] <Cork> or what ever relation you need
[09:19:06] <PCatinean> and that would disable a select if it's a option and do nothing if it's a simple input field?
[09:19:25] <Cork> heh missed one part
[09:19:35] <Cork> PCatinean: .filter('option').filter('[value="' + onchange_vals['value_ids'].join('"],[value="') + '"]').closest('select').prop('disabled', true);
[09:19:51] <Cork> THAT would target options in the input variable
[09:20:02] <Cork> and only find the options matching the value_ids list
[09:20:36] <Cork> and in this case then find the select element parent and set it to disabled
[09:20:43] <PCatinean> So I should make all otions from all selects hidden, then filter on value ids and show them (or remove for compatibility)
[09:20:47] <Cork> (i know it isn't what you want to do, but you should get the point)
[09:20:59] <Cork> ya, that would work
[09:21:05] <PCatinean> That makes a lot more sense....
[09:23:12] <Kartagis> can I get base64 encoded string only from a canvas?
[09:23:44] <Cork> Kartagis: what is it you want to do?
[09:23:49] <Cork> encode a string?
[09:24:03] <Kartagis> Cork: aye
[09:24:18] <Cork> btoa("atfh &%#")
[09:24:27] <Kartagis> Cork: I need that to send to server
[09:24:39] <Cork> btoa("atfh &%#") == "YXRmaCAmJSM="
[09:24:48] <Cork> atob("YXRmaCAmJSM=") == "atfh &%#"
[09:24:58] <Kartagis> Cork: any chance you own a cat? :P
[09:25:09] <Cork> cat?
[09:25:26] <Kartagis> it's walking on the keyboard
[09:25:32] <Cork> ah :)
[09:25:52] <Cork> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowBase64/btoa
[09:25:54] <Cork> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowBase64/atob
[09:26:21] <Kartagis> Cork: all the examples I found so far point to canvas
[09:26:39] <Cork> Kartagis: i guess you looked at so huh? :)
[09:27:12] <Kartagis> Cork: no, I googled for get base64 from image
[09:27:20] <Cork> ah, from image
[09:27:23] <Cork> you said string
[09:27:52] <Kartagis> did I?
[09:27:59] <Cork> <Cork> encode a string?
[09:27:59] <Cork> <Kartagis> Cork: aye
[09:27:59] <Kartagis> oh yes,
[09:28:19] <Cork> so you need to provide what you're actually trying to do
[09:28:23] <Kartagis> I might not have used to correct term
[09:29:24] <Kartagis> I'm using a cordova plugin to pick images from phone and then creating correspoding img divs
[09:29:30] <Kartagis> and src'ing
[09:29:51] <Cork> img divs??
[09:30:25] <Kartagis> I also need to get their base64 encoded <inserttermhere> to use in an ajax call to send to server
[09:30:35] <Kartagis> yes, divs
[09:30:47] <Cork> so you mean background images on a div?
[09:30:50] <Kartagis> let me demonstrate
[09:30:52] <Kartagis> no no
[09:30:57] <Kartagis> one sec
[09:30:59] <Cork> i think that is the better option ya
[09:31:50] <Kartagis> http://termbin.com/r1ed
[09:32:34] <Kartagis> imagePicker is a cordova plugin that allows me to pick multiple images from the device
[09:33:21] <Cork> i see you creating an img tag
[09:33:27] <Cork> what div are you talking about?
[09:33:36] <Kartagis> sorry, right
[09:33:40] <Kartagis> only img
[09:33:42] <Cork> (also you have an undefined img variable)
[09:34:09] <Kartagis> you mean img=... ?
[09:34:13] <Cork> yes
[09:34:19] <Cork> that creates a page global variable
[09:34:56] <PCatinean> I wonder if there's a css selector for elements with non-empty values
[09:35:08] <Kartagis> I did that to access it in the console
[09:35:10] <Cork> PCatinean: :not(:empty)
[09:35:28] <Kartagis> I discovered I could, if I don't use var
[09:35:54] <Cork> Kartagis: ya, but it risks creating conflicts
[09:36:01] <Cork> and is something you should never do
[09:36:11] <Xatenev> Cork:
[09:36:16] <Cork> put a breakpoint in the click handler if you need to work with it
[09:36:26] <Xatenev> i got an input field which should be instant search
[09:36:30] <Xatenev> what event do i need there
[09:36:34] <Xatenev> like keydown?
[09:36:52] <Xatenev> the problem is if somebody copies something into it, it hsould search vtoo
[09:36:53] <Cork> Xatenev: please don't direct questions at me, just ask them ppl will answer if they have time/know the answer
[09:36:56] <Xatenev> so keydown is not enough
[09:37:15] <Xatenev> yea but u are here and know it anyways xD
[09:37:29] <Cork> ...
[09:37:35] <Xatenev> sry^^
[09:37:52] <Kartagis> Cork: so, what do you suggest I do?
[09:38:04] <PCatinean> Thanks Cork
[09:38:09] <arc_> Xatenev https://api.jquery.com/change/
[09:38:18] <cyberbrai> Hello there
[09:38:24] <Xatenev> arc_: not what i need
[09:38:25] <PCatinean> I assume there's no selector to select options that have no other siblings
[09:38:28] <Kartagis> Xatenev: keypress
[09:38:34] <Xatenev> the change event obviously just triggers when i leave the input field again
[09:38:36] <Cork> Kartagis: so you need to fetch the image and then convert the content to base64 encoded data?
[09:38:41] <Xatenev> arc_: so not instant, just when the value really changed
[09:38:43] <cyberbrai> How to handle audio and video tags of brower
[09:38:46] <Kartagis> Cork: exactly
[09:38:48] <Cork> Kartagis: are you sure you can't just use the formData object?
[09:38:50] <Xatenev> Kartagis: but what about copy?
[09:39:07] <grimgrinn> hi
[09:39:08] <arc_> do you mean paste?
[09:39:10] <grimgrinn> got some issues
[09:39:13] <Cork> Kartagis: keypress isn't a standard event
[09:39:15] <Cork> don't use it
[09:39:15] <grimgrinn> can you help
[09:39:26] <Xatenev> arc_: ye
[09:39:37] <Kartagis> hrm
[09:39:38] <Cork> Xatenev: i would recommend using the input event
[09:39:40] <Xatenev> arc_: i need some kind of combination from keydown and smth else
[09:39:45] <Kartagis> I had no idea
[09:39:50] <Xatenev> Cork: input event?
[09:40:01] <Cork> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/input
[09:40:07] <grimgrinn> navigator.geolocation checking does not working ( its shows its on rather it allow in browser or not
[09:40:13] <Cork> yes input
[09:40:19] <Xatenev> Cork: thats a new one right
[09:40:21] <Cork> as in .on('input', func)
[09:40:25] <Cork> no
[09:40:30] <Xatenev> html5
[09:40:31] <Xatenev> atleast
[09:40:32] <koolranch> I'm having with loading dynamic content on a button press, I have this: http://codepen.io/anon/pen/OyQEjX
[09:40:36] <Xatenev> whatever that means
[09:40:37] <Cork> well if you consider existing for like 12 years new...
[09:40:40] <koolranch> It doesn't seem to even respond though
[09:40:48] <Xatenev> Cork: well no
[09:40:48] <Xatenev> xd
[09:40:51] <koolranch> and I'm calling in the latest libraries
[09:40:52] <Xatenev> just didnt know that lawl
[09:40:53] <Cork> Xatenev: you need ie9+
[09:40:58] <Xatenev> Cork: i think thats manageable
[09:41:03] <Xatenev> i will just update my IE fast
[09:41:09] <Cork> <_<
[09:41:11] <Kartagis> isn't FormData used for canvases?
[09:41:12] <Xatenev> Cork: LOL
[09:41:19] <Cork> Kartagis: no
[09:41:28] <Cork> formdata is for sending files over ajax
[09:42:03] <Cork> Kartagis: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FormData/Using_FormData_Objects
[09:42:27] <PCatinean> What about select all selects fields that have no option values from array X
[09:42:34] <Cork> you will need to get access to the data before you can do that though
[09:42:34] <Xatenev> Cork: exactly what i wanted
[09:42:41] <Xatenev> works for paste and keydown, thaanks
[09:42:42] <Cork> the url won't help you
[09:42:56] <Cork> PCatinean: that is more complicated
[09:43:04] <PCatinean> Hmm, figures
[09:43:20] <Cork> Xatenev: note input is not the same as keydown
[09:43:34] <Cork> Xatenev: it fires after the value is added to the input value
[09:43:38] <Cork> not before like keydown is
[09:44:00] <Cork> (and is one of the main reasons why you should use it instead of keydown)
[09:44:29] <Cork> keydown will cause it to to always be one entry behind
[09:47:06] <PCatinean> What about select_fields.children('option').not(':empty,.custom');
[09:47:17] <PCatinean> not :empty and do not have class custom
[09:47:20] <PCatinean> I think that's right
[09:47:25] <Cork> that will select the options not the selects
[09:47:34] <Kartagis> I don't see how do get image here
[09:47:35] <PCatinean> yes that's the point
[09:47:46] <PCatinean> And it was name != custom
[09:47:53] <Cork> Kartagis: you would have to ajax request the data
[09:47:56] <Cork> as you have an url
[09:48:14] <PCatinean> var options = select_fields.children('option').not(':empty,[name!="custom"]'); YAY
[09:48:31] <Cork> ah
[09:48:49] <Cork> but are you sure about [name!="custom"] ?
[09:48:55] <Cork> you are double not there
[09:48:57] <PCatinean> It seems to work: http://hastebin.com/susunoyeju.coffee
[09:49:08] <Cork> not('[name!= <--
[09:49:16] <PCatinean> ahhhhh
[09:49:20] <PCatinean> double negation
[09:49:24] <PCatinean> how does it work then...wierd
[09:49:44] <PCatinean> or is it checking for both
[09:49:54] <PCatinean> not empty and also name differs from custom
[09:50:03] <PCatinean> maybe I should do two not()
[09:50:09] <PCatinean> wai no, that's silly
[09:50:18] <PCatinean> it only works with !=
[09:56:15] <dimi1947> in what case addClass...will also apply display none to the element for which it is itended
[09:58:17] <dimi1947> I am facing such a case now
[10:00:00] <gnarf> PCatinean: .not(':empty,[name!="custom"]') should me to filter the options, remove any empty or elements whos name is not custom
[10:00:05] <gnarf> so basically
[10:00:17] <PCatinean> gnarf, yes I figured it out, thanks so much :D
[10:00:20] <PCatinean> It's just like that
[10:00:26] <gnarf> .children('option[name="custom"]') ?
[10:00:52] <gnarf> it just seems weird
[10:00:59] <PCatinean> Not sure what you mean there
[10:01:02] <gnarf> oh - you want empty options, or custom option
[10:01:18] <PCatinean> everything except empty options and custom options
[10:01:33] <gnarf> then if you want everything except empty and custom
[10:01:41] <gnarf> you want .not(name=custom)
[10:01:54] <PCatinean> yeah, that's what you posted :D
[10:02:15] <gnarf> not (name != 'custom) means name='custom
[10:02:33] <gnarf> so you are getting custom elements, OR, not empty
[10:03:27] <gnarf> if you want not custom or not empty -- .not(":empty,[name='custom']") makes more sense
[10:04:29] <gnarf> doing a .not on a comma list makes it a little harder to reason about too
[10:04:56] <gnarf> because .not(':empty').not('[name='custom']') matches differently
[10:05:58] <gnarf> i guess it doesnt
[10:05:59] <gnarf> nvm
[10:06:09] <gnarf> if either are true, it excludes from the match
[10:20:31] <hellyeah> taplar:  you still there?
[10:24:18] <CapnKlutch> How can I get this to always listen for the change - http://jsfiddle.net/dkm4a5q9/
[10:24:35] <CapnKlutch> I want it to alert when it finds 414
[10:24:36] <hellyeah> yeah i am newbie but ass fatr as i understand i need the string that i commented out above what can i do for having this? http://jsfiddle.net/9jdp7ojm/57/
[10:27:23] <CapnKlutch> Can someone please take a look - http://jsfiddle.net/dkm4a5q9/
[10:33:27] <taplar> hellyeah: http://jsfiddle.net/9jdp7ojm/58/
[10:34:51] <hellyeah> hm
[10:34:58] <hellyeah> you use data()
[10:37:44] <hellyeah> taplar:  this data() function should give you data attribute of button?
[10:37:47] <hellyeah> ?
[10:38:09] <taplar> data() without arguments returns an object containing all the key value pairs for the data fields
[10:38:22] <taplar> data(key) returns the value for that one data key
[10:38:29] <taplar> data(key, value) sets the value for that key
[10:39:09] <hellyeah> i understand
[10:39:33] <hellyeah> but result seems kinda weird? http://jsfiddle.net/9jdp7ojm/60/
[10:39:50] <taplar> y?
[10:41:09] <hellyeah> existing 1: a
[10:41:24] <taplar> that's the key name and value
[10:41:27] <taplar> look at the html
[10:43:31] <hellyeah> but i changed data attribuıte as project_name blah why it didnt give me that
[10:44:16] <taplar> you set the attribute 'data', not a data element
[10:44:19] <taplar> data-*
[10:44:34] <taplar> split your inputs into their own respective data-* pieces
[10:45:18] <hellyeah> hmm ic
[10:45:20] <gnarf> taplar: hellyeah: - or just use $.fn.data() to set the data
[10:45:40] <taplar> that's what i'm nudging him towards
[10:46:15] <gnarf> $('.buttonClass').data({ project_name: 'SearchEngine', environment: 'Prod', frontend: 'Monitor' })
[10:47:59] <hellyeah> gnarf:  thankls
[10:50:03] <Cork> gnarf: doesn't that also purge all other values that might be in there?
[10:50:13] <gnarf> Cork: not since 1.4.3
[10:50:15] <Cork> nice
[10:50:18] <gnarf> Cork: it's extend
[10:50:29] <gnarf> http://api.jquery.com/data/#data-obj
[10:50:46] * Cork nods
[10:50:47] <gnarf> Prior to jQuery 1.4.3 (starting in jQuery 1.4) the .data() method completely replaced all data, instead of just extending the data object. If you are using third-party plugins it may not be advisable to completely replace the element's data object, since plugins may have also set data.
[10:50:52] <Cork> really good to know
[10:50:55] <gnarf> so for a very short while it did a replace
[10:51:02] <gnarf> until we fixed it
[10:51:03] <gnarf> :)
[10:51:06] <Cork> ya and that hit me :)
[10:51:17] <Cork> and then i stayed away from using {} with .data() :)
[10:51:32] <gnarf> :)
[10:51:58] <gnarf> all the other .method( object ) signatures are extends
[10:52:01] <gnarf> so we updated it to match
[10:52:04] <gnarf> pretty quickly
[10:52:14] <gnarf> who knows - maybe your bug report that got us to fix it
[10:52:14] <Cork> ya, and it makes much more sense
[10:52:21] <taplar> heh, death to the redheaded stepchild
[10:52:41] <Cork> gnarf: i didn't file one, cause i didn't see it as a bug
[10:52:51] <taplar> 'feature'? ;)
[10:53:05] <Cork> just "guess that can be useful but not for me"
[10:56:04] <gnarf> taplar: also not sure why - but that phrase bugs me, just one of many "discrimination" colloquialisms that really shouldn't be used
[10:56:19] <taplar> feature?
[10:56:43] <gnarf> redheaded stepchild
[10:56:46] <taplar> oh
[10:57:56] <gnarf> it ranks somewhere around calling things "crazy" or "insane" for me --- trying not to use it personally and mentioning its possible offensive quaities to people who do
[10:59:22] <taplar> heh, i rarely use it, and have never used it in the context of someone who was redheaded or a stepchild.  just a phrase to me
[11:00:19] <gnarf> I think the context doesn't matter so much -- it just implies that redheads and stepchildren deserve bullying
[11:00:32] <gnarf> stupid phrase
[11:00:35] <gnarf> :)
[11:01:09] <gnarf> anywho - no biggie, just wanted to let you know that I'm sensitive to it, and maybe you should try to use it even less :)
[11:01:44] <taplar> noted
[11:02:08] <jcrawford> anyone that can lend a hand with getting at an element which is loaded via ajax and not in the DOM on page load?  I am trying to get all inputs from a form that is loaded in a light window via ajax so that I can enable/disable the submit button when necessary
[11:02:41] <gnarf> jcrawford: does the thing your using have a callback after the content is added?
[11:02:57] <jcrawford> the ajax has a success handler but I cannot seem to access the elements there either
[11:03:02] <gnarf> or did you write it yourself? you should add a "contentAdded" hook
[11:03:13] <gnarf> jcrawford: somewhere it does a .append or .html
[11:03:18] <gnarf> you need to put your code after that
[11:03:19] <jcrawford> no
[11:04:05] <gnarf> if all you have is the ajax handler, you might be able to just check on a setTimeout( fn, 0 ) to let it finish adding html/etc and just check "next frame"
[11:04:36] <gnarf> but usually - part of the ajax handler will manipulate the page with .html / .append or whatever -- thats how it adds the new DOM content
[11:04:44] <gnarf> and you need to get a callback / hook in there
[11:05:24] <jcrawford> gnarf: this is what I currently have
[11:05:24] <jcrawford> http://pastie.org/10502145
[11:05:56] <gnarf> what is .foundation
[11:06:16] <gnarf> any api docs for it?
[11:06:55] <jcrawford> http://foundation.zurb.com/docs/components/reveal.html
[11:07:07] <jcrawford> i've been over that and that's how i got the light window to load with ajax
[11:07:32] <gnarf> looks like it fires a $(document).on('opened.fndtn.reveal', '[data-reveal]', function () {
[11:07:32] <gnarf>   var modal = $(this);
[11:07:32] <gnarf> });
[11:07:44] <gnarf> that probably happens after the content has been added
[11:08:32] <gnarf> you can probably bind a .on('opened.fndtn.reveal') to the container
[11:09:42] <jcrawford> on the input container or are you speaking of the modal container?
[11:11:22] <gnarf>  $('#record-asset-modal').on('opened.fndtn.reveal', function() { ... what you had in success here ... })
[11:11:33] <gnarf> right before you call the .foundation('reveal', 'open')
[11:11:50] <gnarf> or setup before you call it
[11:12:07] <jcrawford> will try that out, thanks
[11:15:35] <jcrawford> thanks gnarf I was able to get it working that way :)
[11:15:37] <jcrawford> I hadn
[11:15:42] <jcrawford> 't seen that ability in the docs
[11:18:42] <deadowl> I have a script that dynamically populates select menus that are dynamically created. When I use a selector with the form as the context (as jQuery object, selector, etc), it gives me a jQuery object with a length of 1 (expected), but the element is populated as undefined (not expected). Any ideas?
[11:19:10] <deadowl> This is _after_ the select menus are dynamically added to the form*
[11:23:08] <gnarf> deadowl: selection[0] === undefined but selection.length === 1
[11:23:09] <gnarf> ?
[11:23:14] <gnarf> seems strange
[11:23:19] <deadowl> yep
[11:23:22] <gnarf> can you make a jsfiddle?
[11:24:02] <deadowl> Could try
[11:25:59] <deadowl> when I do it without the context it's fine, but then I'm trying to reuse the code for different forms.
[11:30:09] <dave1984> is camelcase still the most used for function names or underscores?
[11:30:57] <deadowl> camelcase is pretty standard coding style for javascript
[11:31:27] <deadowl> I'm guessing because they tried to follow Java's code style conventions
[11:31:35] <dave1984> ive always used underscores but id have no problem switching if itd be more consistent with whats more common
[11:33:34] <deadowl> Most built-in JS uses camelcase. Then again, Javascript lets people use a wide range of characters in unicode for variables and function names, so I would say just be consistent is the general rule of thumb.
[11:55:20] <Logicgate> Is there a way to do event delegation using DOM bubbling via jQuery
[11:55:29] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[11:55:33] <robertmaxrees> .on() supports that.
[11:55:45] <robertmaxrees> $('parent').on('event', 'child', function() {});
[11:56:02] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events for more info.
[11:56:23] <Logicgate> robertmaxrees, is that supported in production version 1.1?
[11:56:38] <robertmaxrees> 1.1?! that's... ancient.
[11:57:27] <Logicgate> I can't run jQuery 2 because I need it to be reverse compat to IE8
[11:57:29] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[11:57:35] <robertmaxrees> 1.1 or 1.11?
[11:57:38] <Logicgate> 1.13
[11:57:43] <robertmaxrees> okay, that's modern
[11:58:01] <robertmaxrees> the 1.x and 2.x series have the exact same features - 1 just includes compatibility for old IE.
[11:58:03] <Logicgate> 1.11.3 Lol jesus
[11:58:14] <Logicgate> Oh okay great!
[11:58:32] <robertmaxrees> and .on() has been in since 1.7
[11:58:34] <Logicgate> I've been a MooTools user for years now. getting used to jQuery..
[11:58:42] <Logicgate> Awesome robertmaxrees, thank you.
[11:58:45] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[11:59:13] <Logicgate> can you use a selector for that
[11:59:26] <robertmaxrees> for what?
[11:59:35] <Logicgate> like $('parent').on('event', '.item .child',...
[11:59:52] <robertmaxrees> yeah - in fact, you can only use a selector, no jquery object: http://api.jquery.com/on/
[12:00:40] <Logicgate> okay great!
[12:01:08] <Logicgate> can also use "delegate" by the looks of it
[12:01:16] <robertmaxrees> .on() is preferred.
[12:01:31] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/delegate/ -> "As of jQuery 1.7, .delegate() has been superseded by the .on() method."
[12:01:40] <robertmaxrees> same with .live()
[12:01:48] <robertmaxrees> they exist, but you really should use .on() instead.
[12:07:12] <OnceMe> hello how can I exclude one specific div in a selector $?
[12:07:35] <OnceMe> something like $updates.on("click", '.mainview:not(.excluded)', function (e) { }
[12:09:17] <OnceMe> because for e.target I get in console log, full <div class="excluded"></div> thing
[12:10:13] <Uhkis_> $updates.not('.excluded').on..
[12:11:24] <OnceMe> ok
[12:11:37] <robertmaxrees> or check the .closest() for that class and validate there.
[12:11:46] <OnceMe> I thought by doing this if($(e.target).is("div.excluded") {}else { //not }
[12:11:50] <OnceMe> but your method might work too
[12:12:11] <robertmaxrees> once are you talking about the child or parent element?
[12:12:29] <OnceMe> about child
[12:12:38] <robertmaxrees> then the selection Uhkis gave you won't work.
[12:12:45] <OnceMe> yeah
[12:12:47] <OnceMe> it doesnt work :D
[12:12:55] <robertmaxrees> you need to check if $(this) or $(e.target) or whatever matches your criteria.
[12:12:58] <OnceMe> can I just do if$(e.target)..?
[12:13:08] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[12:13:31] <OnceMe> did this if ($(e.target).is("div.excluded")) {}else { //not } but it doesnt work
[12:13:38] <OnceMe> maybe without div.excluded? just .excluded?
[12:13:47] <robertmaxrees> don't prepend tagnames.
[12:13:52] <robertmaxrees> make a fiddle.
[12:14:01] <robertmaxrees> we can't see your html, so we can't know.
[12:14:20] <arup_r> I was reading js file to fix a issue. But I don't understand what $el means here. Any help what does it mean? https://gist.github.com/aruprakshit/0fdcdb093e64f52ba152#file-player-js-L163
[12:15:04] <robertmaxrees> arup_r you find where $el is getting set.
[12:15:09] <robertmaxrees> https://gist.github.com/aruprakshit/0fdcdb093e64f52ba152#file-player-js-L8
[12:15:54] <arup_r> yes, I meant $el is a global var ?
[12:16:02] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[12:16:09] <robertmaxrees> did you look at the line i just linked?
[12:16:15] <OnceMe> actually eh, I append dynamically things to excluded div, so I get in console.log that appended tag
[12:16:23] <OnceMe> how can I get parent? but only one el up?
[12:16:30] <arup_r> Yes, I am on that. I meant this.el and this.$el is confusing me
[12:16:53] <robertmaxrees> OnceMe can't see your html so it's impossible to help you.
[12:17:11] <robertmaxrees> arup_r this.el is $(this.$el).get(0); - the underlying DOM element.
[12:18:28] <arup_r> Ok. I am talking about syntax. Why on line #8 it is this.$el ? It could be only $this.el also right?
[12:18:34] <robertmaxrees> no.
[12:18:46] <arup_r> does $el has any special meaning ?
[12:18:48] <robertmaxrees> no.
[12:18:51] <robertmaxrees> this does
[12:18:52] <arup_r> :)
[12:18:58] <robertmaxrees> 'this' is a specific object.
[12:19:21] <arup_r> ok. and this.$el means ?
[12:19:37] <robertmaxrees> you can't magically use $this - they're trying to add a property to the context of the function - this.$el is the $el property of 'this'\
[12:19:41] <robertmaxrees> 'this' is special.
[12:19:44] <robertmaxrees> $this is just an object.
[12:19:58] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/this
[12:20:12] <robertmaxrees> so 'this' and '$this' are entirely different things.
[12:20:17] <Uhkis> just a variable :-P
[12:20:32] <robertmaxrees> $this is just a variable, yes.  this is not just a variable.
[12:39:57] <winegoddess> 	i want to set up a local server to test JQuery AJAX calls. I have done this with node.js but am not getting data outside of node project. any ideas on troubleshooting? ive read .error handler isnt called on handler is not called for cross-domain script. any ideas?
[12:40:22] <robertmaxrees> this is strictly for testing?
[12:40:34] <winegoddess> hi robertmaxrees - yes.
[12:40:40] <robertmaxrees> enable CORS then.
[12:40:42] <winegoddess> im not seeing any errors in chrome dev
[12:41:06] <winegoddess> i did add code in express routes to allow CORS - from an example i followed. i no longer get any errors, just no data
[12:41:24] <robertmaxrees> then something else is wrong.
[12:41:41] <winegoddess> yes, not sure how to further troubleshoot.
[12:41:51] <robertmaxrees> are you running the test page from the same server?
[12:41:54] <winegoddess> and i didnt realize .error handler doesnt work in crodd domain
[12:42:04] <robertmaxrees> .error or .fail?
[12:42:07] <winegoddess> test page form within node project works
[12:42:08] <robertmaxrees> because there's no error method.
[12:42:24] <robertmaxrees> okay, so where are you running the test page from where it DOESN'T work?
[12:42:30] <robertmaxrees> have you checked the network tab?
[12:43:18] <winegoddess> i have checked the network tab.   im using the full url to localhost from my standalone jquery code in the file not in the server.
[12:43:40] <robertmaxrees> and the network tab shows a successful request?  just no response body?
[12:43:48] <robertmaxrees> sounds like maybe you didn't properly enable CORS.
[12:45:07] <winegoddess> im not very familiar with the network tab. it shows pending.   for enabling CORS i used this... http://enable-cors.org/server_expressjs.html
[12:45:20] <winegoddess> its quite possible and likely, i havent doen this properly
[12:45:53] <robertmaxrees> sounds like you need to familiarize yourself with the network tab :) i might hit up #Node.js for more help here though, since this sounds like CORS wasn't enabled properly.
[12:46:06] <winegoddess> okay thanks robertmaxrees
[12:46:35] <winegoddess> i will try to google for pending on the network tab. any recommended tuts on network tab?
[12:47:02] <robertmaxrees> http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide33
[12:47:04] <robertmaxrees> good place to start.
[12:48:15] <winegoddess> thank you!   well, i made some progress! Seems AdBlock was causing pending. :)
[12:48:22] <robertmaxrees> there you go.
[12:49:22] <winegoddess> and my error handler from my ajax call is getting kicked off now.  Im confused since others posted and the documentation says the handler does not get called cross domain.  trying to understadn this better which is why i am setting up this test
[12:49:50] <robertmaxrees> there are some cases where error won't fire, but those aren't super common.
[12:49:56] <robertmaxrees> and you should probably prefer .fail() anyway
[12:50:23] <winegoddess> thanks for the advice robertmaxrees - i wil check into that as well
[12:52:25] <Uhkis> never use adblock when developing
[12:52:41] <taplar> lol
[12:55:02] <robertmaxrees> yeah pretty much.
[13:52:50] <OnceMe> this: $(e.target).parent().find(".load").delay(4000).append("test"); appends "test" immediatelly, why?
[13:54:25] <Logicgate> Can anybody help, this isn't necessarily jQuery related
[13:54:41] <Logicgate> I'm having problems with XML HTTP Request stalling on safari mobile when hitting the refresh button
[13:54:53] <Logicgate> If I navigate to the URL using the go button, everything works
[13:55:16] <Logicgate> When I hit the refresh button to reload the page, the XML HTTP Request stalls for 20 seconds then response is handled..
[13:55:29] <Logicgate> I can make a test case
[13:55:36] <OnceMe> setTimeout() solved this for me
[14:03:18] <Kamuela> Can you use jQuery to select everything of a certain color?
[14:05:20] <robertmaxrees> sort of?
[14:06:53] <Kamuela> I suppose the functionality I'm looking for is being able to select the "next" thing of a certain color
[14:07:12] <robertmaxrees> that's pretty weird.  why not use classes to assign that color and then get that class
[14:08:34] <Kamuela> I'm thinking more like a chrome extension
[14:08:39] <Kamuela> To change colors
[14:08:53] <robertmaxrees> right?  you still want to use classes for that kind of behavior.
[14:09:02] <robertmaxrees> otherwise it's going to be super slow.
[14:09:57] <marketing5> i cannot add an onclick event to an element is js or jquery for the life of me
[14:10:17] <robertmaxrees> show us what you've tried :)
[14:10:30] <robertmaxrees> try something like http://jsfiddle.net/
[14:10:36] <marketing5> $( document ).ready(function() {
[14:10:36] <marketing5>     document.getElementById('btnSubmitOrder').onclick = 'brontoadd()';
[14:10:36] <marketing5> });
[14:10:41] <robertmaxrees> please don't paste into the channel.
[14:10:55] <marketing5> its 3 lines but sure
[14:10:59] <robertmaxrees> i can see that!
[14:11:09] <robertmaxrees> it's hard to read and spams everybody.  i also can't run it in the channel ;)
[14:11:31] <marketing5> ok let me whip up a non-private codepen
[14:11:44] <marketing5> http://codepen.io/alexxsawyer/pen/gaRRyM/
[14:11:58] <robertmaxrees> so if you have jquery, just use .on()
[14:12:34] <marketing5> can you elaborate
[14:12:41] <marketing5> and i would prefer to do pure js
[14:12:53] <robertmaxrees> then why are you using jquery in your codePen?
[14:13:21] <Uhkis> and why are you here instead of ##javascript
[14:13:28] <robertmaxrees> that too.
[14:13:34] <robertmaxrees> use https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/addEventListener
[14:13:51] <marketing5> Because i have jqueary and can use it and will use it
[14:13:58] <robertmaxrees> wat
[14:14:01] <marketing5> im in here because it uses jquery
[14:14:03] <robertmaxrees> so then why a native js event handler?
[14:14:14] <marketing5> lets keep it productive guys and quit complaining eh
[14:14:20] <robertmaxrees> LOL
[14:14:37] <robertmaxrees> we're not complaining - it's just really strange that you're asking for native js help in #jquery.
[14:14:38] <robertmaxrees> document.getElementById('btnSubmitOrder').addEventListener('click', function() {
[14:14:40] <robertmaxrees> that's what you want.
[14:14:41] <marketing5> it doesnt matter if it uses js or jquery
[14:14:56] <robertmaxrees> lol
[14:14:57] <marketing5> i said that as im trying to better my own js skills and only use jquery as a crutch
[14:15:04] <robertmaxrees> #welp
[14:15:05] <marketing5> but crutches can be useful
[14:15:07] <Uhkis> either way it uses js ;)
[14:15:21] <marketing5> just trying to get the most out of my irc encounters when someone can help
[14:15:41] <robertmaxrees> there's a way to do that without being rude to the people you're asking for help from :)
[14:15:59] <marketing5> i have tried the addevent listener with no sucess
[14:16:06] <robertmaxrees> show us.
[14:16:16] <marketing5> here let me make a more basic codepen...
[14:16:49] <marketing5> i want to be able to add the onclick event on doc ready and then be able to inspect the element in dev tools and see the onclick event in place
[14:17:03] <robertmaxrees> *event handler, fwiw.
[14:17:12] <marketing5> this is literally the last part of this task and is the only thing giving me trouble currently
[14:18:26] <marketing5> i dont feel im being rude, i feel the snarky comment trying to dismiss me to the #javascript channel were unecessary and rude
[14:18:46] <marketing5> but all this is unecessary
[14:18:48] <robertmaxrees> we're not being snarky - you were being specific about not using jquery.
[14:18:49] <marketing5> lets talk code
[14:18:54] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[14:19:17] <marketing5> i specifically used the word "prefer" to use js
[14:19:34] <robertmaxrees> okay - if you were to use jquery, you could just use .on()
[14:19:35] <marketing5> and i digress again...
[14:19:51] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, .addEventListener() is the method you want.
[14:21:07] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/vffymnLg/
[14:23:48] <marketing5> http://codepen.io/alexxsawyer/pen/gaRRyM/?editors=001
[14:23:55] <marketing5> no dice with jquery method
[14:24:05] <robertmaxrees> i'm not seeing any .on() in there.
[14:24:28] <marketing5> $('#btnSubmitOrder').on('click', function() {
[14:24:32] <robertmaxrees> yeah, not seeing that.
[14:24:40] <marketing5> http://codepen.io/alexxsawyer/pen/gaRRyM/?editors=001
[14:25:15] <robertmaxrees> ah, because you don't want the click event.
[14:25:20] <robertmaxrees> the form is submitting.
[14:26:02] <marketing5> the pen has been used for a previous implementation of similar functionality
[14:26:08] <marketing5> the form is being reused
[14:26:14] <robertmaxrees> you want to bind ot the form's submit action and preventDefault();
[14:26:34] <marketing5> can you elaborate
[14:26:41] <robertmaxrees> http://codepen.io/anon/pen/EVQOBg?editors=001
[14:27:52] <marketing5> that codepen doesnt work either
[14:28:01] <robertmaxrees> so define "doesn't work" - what is it not doing?
[14:28:07] <marketing5> and the real application will have this attacked to a checkout button
[14:28:25] <marketing5> i cannot interfere with other functionality of that button
[14:28:35] <marketing5> i need this function to fire in parallel
[14:28:36] <robertmaxrees> what are you expecting to happen when you click that button?
[14:29:12] <marketing5> if there is and email in the feild, and the checkbox is check, it will inject an img tag to the page when the button is clicked
[14:29:27] <marketing5> if it is unchecked it injects a different img tag
[14:29:29] <marketing5> thats it
[14:29:36] <robertmaxrees> but the page will reload.
[14:29:38] <marketing5> summary of all the js in that pen
[14:29:53] <robertmaxrees> so changing out the image won't really do anything.
[14:30:04] <marketing5> in the real implementation the page will be redirected
[14:30:10] <robertmaxrees> right.
[14:30:13] <robertmaxrees> so the page will reload.
[14:30:18] <marketing5> in the pen it will reload but that doesnt matter if the js fires correctly
[14:30:31] <robertmaxrees> it will reload int he real application too.
[14:30:46] <marketing5> elaborate
[14:30:55] <robertmaxrees> define "redirect"
[14:31:26] <marketing5> this eill be attached to the "place order now" button on this page https://www.landscapelightingworld.com/one-page-checkout.asp
[14:31:41] <robertmaxrees> lol
[14:31:54] <robertmaxrees> so does it cause an actual full page reload?
[14:32:10] <marketing5> i really dont understand your angle
[14:32:24] <marketing5> what happens after is irellevant
[14:32:24] <robertmaxrees> form submissions usually cause the page to reload.
[14:32:32] <robertmaxrees> adding an image to the page won't work because the page will reload.
[14:32:36] <robertmaxrees> so that part of the code won't do anything.
[14:32:59] <marketing5> the img tag needs to be written before the reload or redirect or whtevr
[14:33:17] <marketing5> http://www.landscapelightingworld.com/contractor-sign-in-a/145.htm
[14:33:19] <robertmaxrees> okay, then you need to prevent the form submit, append the image, then trigger the submit.
[14:33:26] <marketing5> similar code is in place and functioning on that link
[14:33:37] <marketing5> its attached to the submit button
[14:33:55] <marketing5> i have acess to the html of this page so all i had to do was directly add the onclick event to the button
[14:34:03] <robertmaxrees> oh okay.  then do it that way.
[14:34:05] <robertmaxrees> sorry for wasting your time.
[14:34:23] <marketing5> the problem with the other project in question is that i cannot manually add an onclick event directly to the html and must do it with js or jquery
[14:34:44] <marketing5> ???
[14:35:05] <taplar> that's not a problem really.  you should separate your markup and logic anyway
[14:35:06] <robertmaxrees> i don't know how i'm not being clear here so I'
[14:35:15] <robertmaxrees> so i'm just going to give up.
[14:35:24] <robertmaxrees> and yeah, onclick in html is a Bad Idea™
[14:36:27] <marketing5> would you care to alaborate?
[14:36:34] <marketing5> elaborate?
[14:37:35] <marketing5> would love to hear what you have to contribute @taplar
[14:37:49] <robertmaxrees> you shouldn't put js in your html because it's your html - separations of concern.
[14:38:01] <robertmaxrees> much cleaner to go to your JS and have all your logic there.
[14:38:13] <marketing5> all my logic is in there
[14:38:24] <robertmaxrees> not if you're using onclick in your HTML :)
[14:38:26] <marketing5> all thats in the html is the call to the function
[14:38:36] <robertmaxrees> right, which is also apart of the logic.
[14:38:46] <robertmaxrees> that's the event binding - that is logic that binds a listener to an event.
[14:39:26] <marketing5> correct
[14:39:40] <robertmaxrees> so that logic should be in your js.
[14:39:42] <robertmaxrees> not your html.
[14:40:09] <marketing5> so what your saying is that i should do exactly what i came to this channel with in then first place then?
[14:40:20] <marketing5> because we are not talking about the implementation that works
[14:40:34] <marketing5> regardless of the fact that it uses a hardcoded onclick event
[14:40:37] <robertmaxrees> i question whether you really want to bind to the button click and am pretty sure that won't do what you think it'll do.
[14:40:46] <robertmaxrees> but sure.
[14:41:08] <marketing5> i definately want to bind to the button event
[14:41:21] <marketing5> please stop questioning irrelevant pieces of this puzzle
[14:41:27] <robertmaxrees> actually it's entirely relevant.
[14:41:34] <robertmaxrees> but feel free to ignore me - you've been doing a fine job of that so far :)
[14:42:01] <marketing5> ditto lol
[14:42:05] <marketing5> seriously though
[14:42:09] <marketing5> lol
[14:42:20] <marketing5> so do you want to help or stop typing?
[14:42:25] <robertmaxrees> pardon?
[14:42:31] <robertmaxrees> i've been trying to help.
[14:42:39] <marketing5> alright lets start over
[14:42:42] <marketing5> deep breath
[14:42:47] <robertmaxrees> no thanks.
[14:42:48] <robertmaxrees> enjoy!
[14:42:56] <marketing5> lol
[14:44:51] <marketing5> robertmaxrees: "sorry for wasting your time." >> apology accepted :p
[14:44:59] <robertmaxrees> excuse me?
[15:07:28] <Kamuela> what does jquery return when it finds nothing? an empty array?
[15:08:34] <robertmaxrees> empty jquery object, yeah.
[15:08:36] <robertmaxrees> length is 0.
[15:11:13] <Kamuela> var selector = $('.test'); if (selector.length > 0) { selector.do() }
[15:13:28] <robertmaxrees> don't event need that,
[15:13:30] <robertmaxrees> .length
[15:13:41] <robertmaxrees> no need to > 0 - if it's 0, it's falso.
[15:13:50] <robertmaxrees> *falsy - what function are you going to run.
[15:14:12] <Kamuela> triggering a click until there's no class left on a screen
[15:14:22] <Kamuela> then triggering another load
[15:15:11] <robertmaxrees> okay.
[15:55:42] <jak2000> hi all: http://jsfiddle.net/jamiguel77/LLfouzdx/   how to do this operation: Qty1 - Qty2 = Qty3 ?  in a html table?
[15:56:58] <NoiseEee> grab the values and do the math?
[15:57:53] <jak2000> if you see only the column qty2 can be modified, in the other inputs i setting readonly properti, then when the user type a number (keyup event)  minus the qty1
[15:58:09] <NoiseEee> ok
[16:00:33] <theskillwithin> how do you detect when a radio box change in jquery?
[16:01:24] <NoiseEee> same event as any form element event
[16:01:25] <NoiseEee> 'change'
[16:01:49] <NoiseEee> or, if you're wondering about de-selecting etc, you can always listen for 'click'
[16:12:11] <jak2000> NoiseEee: http://jsfiddle.net/jamiguel77/LLfouzdx/1/
[16:12:13] <jak2000> someting?
[16:13:19] <NoiseEee> yeah not really
[16:13:32] <NoiseEee> you want to run the operations when the input gets changed or something, right jak2000?
[16:13:45] <jak2000> yes in keyevent
[16:13:51] <jak2000> keyup
[16:15:10] <jak2000> or blur event
[16:16:37] <hydraidm801> I have a from and when a customer isn't registered I get an internal server error 500 and in the ajax response error it says "Customer matching query does not exist." at some point in the error. How could I catch this and prompt the user to another form to regiester?
[16:16:55] <robertmaxrees> use .fail()
[16:17:24] <robertmaxrees> or catch that server-side, send back a valid response, and look for some kind of status bit you set.
[16:20:05] <hydraidm801> $(this).fail() ?
[16:20:56] <hydraidm801> xhr.fail() ok I found it
[16:21:39] <robertmaxrees> off the ajax.
[16:21:42] <robertmaxrees> $.ajax().fail()
[16:34:39] <hydraidm801> robertmaxrees, where is the error in $.ajax().fail() ?
[16:35:18] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/jquery.ajax/ -> jqXHR.fail(function( jqXHR, textStatus, errorThrown ) {});
[16:38:00] <hydraidm801> ahh ok
[16:45:53] <hydraidm801> robertmaxrees, so .fail() is exactly the same as $.ajax({error: function(xhr,errmsg,err}{//do stuff});  ?
[16:46:01] <robertmaxrees> not the exact same.
[16:46:12] <robertmaxrees> it's the deferred version.
[16:46:27] <hydraidm801> was error deprecated or something?
[16:46:57] <robertmaxrees> things are moving towards deferreds, and deferreds are a cleaner way of handling async tasks anyway.
[16:47:17] <hydraidm801> that makes sense
[16:56:35] <hydraidm801> so I'm guessing this.responsibleFields is supposed to return the fields that made the post fail?
[16:58:27] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[16:58:57] <hydraidm801> I can't figure out how to determine what field makes the form fail
[16:59:07] <robertmaxrees> you need to send that back from your server.
[17:16:48] <Mrprocom> Hello. So I want to make it so that you can change the src of an iframe from a .shiftable link by holding the 1 key first
[17:16:55] <Mrprocom> this was my attempt http://jsfiddle.net/e5mh3fLf/
[17:17:22] <Mrprocom> it's supposed to change the src of the iframe from http://jquery.com/ to http://www.w3schools.com/
[17:18:14] <robertmaxrees> so you need to do two event listeners.
[17:23:50] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/e5mh3fLf/1/ Mrprocom
[17:39:41] <OnceMe> does jquery have native support for cookies?
[17:39:47] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[17:39:50] <OnceMe> I need a way to remember one state of a selector
[17:40:04] <OnceMe> which has certain .prop() set true or false.
[17:40:07] <OnceMe> what is the way to do this?
[17:40:12] <robertmaxrees> server-side.
[17:40:33] <robertmaxrees> depending on what exactly is going on.
[17:40:44] <Mrprocom> robertmaxrees: oh thanks
[17:41:03] <OnceMe> hmm, ok then my idea would be, make a var state = [pullFromServer] and then onLoad page get state and manipulate that with jquery, right?
[17:41:26] <robertmaxrees> or just render the page with that data.
[17:42:11] <OnceMe> well nope, since I generate stuff onHover :D
[17:42:18] <robertmaxrees> i'm way lost.
[17:42:25] <robertmaxrees> but okay.
[17:42:36] <OnceMe> yeah I know :D
[17:43:03] <robertmaxrees> if it's reasonable to do it server-side, do it there.  otherwise, you can use cookies.
[17:47:21] <OnceMe> ok
[17:59:25] <royalty> are you gents keeping it fresh?
[17:59:29] <robertmaxrees> obvs
[17:59:46] <royalty> robertmaxrees, like a true baller?
[17:59:57] <robertmaxrees> duh
[18:00:02] <royalty> dayunngggg
[18:01:13] <hydraidm801> is there a way to go back in debug console?
[18:01:31] <hydraidm801> like if I accidentally skipped the breakpoint I wanted
[18:01:50] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[18:06:05] <hydraidm801> Well there really should be!@#
[18:06:23] <robertmaxrees> that would require a lot more overhead than you're thinking.
[18:15:54] <ssssMd> hello i have a problem with a ajax
[18:15:59] <ssssMd> can anyone help me?
[18:16:03] <robertmaxrees> !ask
[18:16:12] <robertmaxrees> bad bot - just ask.
[18:16:17] <robertmaxrees> :) if somebody can help, they will.
[18:18:40] <robertmaxrees> ssssMd what's the issue?
[18:18:56] <sillyslux> probably a timeout
[18:19:14] <robertmaxrees> wut
[18:19:26] * sillyslux is joking
[18:19:33] * sillyslux is not funny
[18:19:42] * royalty barfs
[18:19:42] * sillyslux is sorry
[18:20:00] * royalty spreads the barf on the floor with his feet, starts screaming
[18:21:43] <royalty> what should i learn guys, react, ember, angular, or backbone
[18:22:16] <robertmaxrees> whichever one is better for your current job.
[18:22:21] <robertmaxrees> (react and backbone imo)
[18:22:47] <Kamuela> any good jquery focused blogs?
[18:23:11] <robertmaxrees> the one on the jquery site.
[18:23:32] <ssssMd> robertmaxrees i'm trying to make a ajax post but it registers as a cross-origin request
[18:23:46] <ssssMd> i tried with www and without and with a relative path
[18:23:52] <ssssMd> but they don't work
[18:24:01] <ssssMd> on xampp it works
[18:24:53] <ssssMd> but after i uploaded it i started getting this error
[18:37:54] <shoky> ssssMd show your code, and the error message
[18:48:09] <ssssMd> shoky: http://notey.it/n/MjIx
[18:48:13] <ssssMd> and error
[18:48:14] <ssssMd> Cross-Origin Request Blocked: The Same Origin Policy disallows reading the remote resource at http://www.darocart.com/bogdan/ajax/register.php.

[18:51:03] <ssssMd> nevermind
[18:51:05] <ssssMd> i fixed it
[18:51:45] <shoky> hokay
[18:53:05] <ssssMd> i needed to set the header in register.php to 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin : *'
[18:53:50] <shoky> that'll allow the cross-origin request, ya
[18:54:51] <ssssMd> yea but why does it register as a cross origin request
[18:54:55] <ssssMd> cuz it is still local...
[18:55:24] <shoky> what's the url of the page doing the request?
[18:55:42] <shoky> and if its on the same origin, just use a relative url
[18:55:52] <ssssMd> i tried that
[18:56:01] <ssssMd> but it still registered as a cross-origin request
[18:56:05] <shoky> same exact error message?
[18:56:24] <ssssMd> yea
[18:57:09] <shoky> got a live link to it?
[18:58:00] <shoky> and what url did you use for the ajax
[18:59:20] <ZeuZ> How can I make a static-like variable in the returned function here: http://jsfiddle.net/6nat055n/ line 21-29
[19:00:19] <ZeuZ> I mean, right now if I do it as it's seen in the code, if I call createSlider on another div, it;ll share slideNumber right?
[19:02:02] <shoky> ZeuZ i guess you just want a variable declared outside of the $.fn.createSlider function
[19:02:06] <shoky> e.g. before it
[19:03:09] <ZeuZ> can't it be self contained inside the returned object from startSlider?
[19:03:09] <shoky> but uh in your code slideNumber will always be 0 or 1 anyways
[19:03:25] <ZeuZ> shoky, right as it is, it actually works
[19:03:39] <ZeuZ> i do see 1..2..3..4..5..n
[19:03:47] <ZeuZ> (In chrome at least)
[19:03:47] <BustyLoli-Chan> Okay... I have a problem
[19:03:47] <shoky> that would be a property of the returned object.. not shared
[19:04:34] <shoky> ZeuZ that doesn't make sense with this code.. you do  slideNumber = 0   and then either you do or don't increment it by 1.  so it's either 0 or 1
[19:05:12] <shoky> ZeuZ becuase slideNumber is local to the .forEach callback function
[19:05:20] <ZeuZ> shocky let me upload it somewhere so you can see it ypurself :P
[19:06:05] <shoky> like jsfiddle?
[19:06:35] <shoky> ZeuZ maybe you meant actualSlide  and not slideNumber ?
[19:07:07] <ZeuZ> it is actualSlide
[19:07:23] <shoky> ok then, you said slideNumber ;p
[19:07:53] <ZeuZ> ups :P ok, although in the code it;s correct I beleave
[19:07:59] <BustyLoli-Chan> I have a database with several entries in it that up date in real time. I'm having jQuery load a php page which gets the latest entry, and then subsequent calls to that php will get all the new items
[19:08:27] <shoky> ZeuZ:  no it's not correct. see:  http://jsfiddle.net/6nat055n/1/    there's  slide_0  and slide_1 and another slide_1
[19:08:33] <BustyLoli-Chan> I then want to take each of these new items as they come in and add them to this div on my web page with animations one at a time
[19:08:47] <BustyLoli-Chan> but basically, I can't think of anyway to do this that isn't crap
[19:09:06] <shoky> ZeuZ:  why are you giving the slides id's anyway? most likely you don't need to and that just complicates things. just give them a shared class
[19:09:23] <ZeuZ> shoky, because I want to have control of each one
[19:09:31] <shoky> you can still have control of each one
[19:09:33] <shoky> no need for id's
[19:09:46] <ZeuZ> shoky, also, you edited it to have a third one, wich is ok, I guessed it should have worked anyways
[19:10:04] <shoky> ZeuZ: yes, to show that slideNumber never increases after 1
[19:10:12] <shoky> it's 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, ...
[19:10:39] <ZeuZ> ah that was wrong too then :P but actualSlide is the one it was returning correct (well at least messaging it)
[19:10:59] <shoky> oks
[19:14:02] <ZeuZ> http://jsfiddle.net/dendfqmn/ ---> I guess my question is, if I call createSlider in another div as it is right now, will they share div, first, timeOut, slideNumber and actualSlide?
[19:16:14] <shoky> ZeuZ: they are local to the $.fn.createSlider function, so each time you call it, they will be new variables for that call. so no, they're not shared between different calls
[19:16:38] <ZeuZ> great :)
[19:17:42] <shoky> ZeuZ:  unless by "share" you mean that different calls will produce the same numbers. then yes. because they're NOT shared, so they can step on each other
[19:17:59] <shoky> your divs will get the same ids if you call it again
[19:18:11] <ZeuZ> ah, that is indeed a problem
[19:18:13] <shoky> *because* actualSlide is not share
[19:18:16] <shoky> shared
[19:18:56] <ZeuZ> you mean slideNumber I beleave (it's the one used for creating them with ifferent ids)
[19:19:06] <ZeuZ> should I declare it before? is there any way it's more contained?
[19:19:20] <shoky> i mean actualSlide
[19:19:26] <shoky> well, both of them
[19:19:54] <shoky> if you want to "contain" it then put a function around it   (function() { ... })()
[19:20:21] <shoky> (function() { var shared = bla;   $.fn.createSlider = function(args) { .... };    })()
[19:20:44] <shoky> but again... stop using id's
[19:20:52] <shoky> and you wont have any of these problems ;p
[19:21:06] <ZeuZ> just give them the same class is suggested then right? :P
[19:21:11] <shoky> yes
[19:22:16] <ZeuZ> how can I match each one of them individually from the returned startSlider function?
[19:22:27] <ZeuZ> I mean, a forEach
[19:22:32] <ZeuZ> right?
[19:22:52] <shoky> um the returned startSlider is just  a function, donno how you plan to get any elements from it ;p
[19:23:07] <shoky> but uh
[19:23:32] <shoky> var slides = $('#div_destino').find('.slide');
[19:23:49] <shoky> slides.eq(5)  is the 6th slide
[19:23:59] <shoky> slides.first() is the first
[19:24:00] <shoky> etc ;p
[19:25:21] <shoky> you could also  return an array/jqueryobj of all the slides created, and put that in the returned object
[19:26:18] <ZeuZ> mind giving me an example? I was going to use the div var in order to have the div they were created on..
[19:26:26] <shoky> e.g. var slides = [];   ...   var slide = $('<div class="slide">');  slide.append(whatever);    slides.push(slide[0]);
[19:26:38] <shoky> then return { startSlider: function...,  slides: slides };
[19:27:15] <shoky> but  .find('.slide')  should be fine too
[19:32:06] <shoky> ZeuZ:  http://jsfiddle.net/dendfqmn/1/
[19:32:54] <shoky> oops called my variable slides too, oh well
[19:35:07] <ZeuZ> also never defined i
[19:35:17] <ZeuZ> oh yeah you did :P
[19:35:19] <ZeuZ> aorry
[19:36:51] <ZeuZ> why isn't the text from the second slide hidden though? isn;t it set to display:none?
[19:37:33] <shoky> it is hidden
[19:37:43] <shoky> bit nicer.. http://jsfiddle.net/dendfqmn/2/
[19:37:48] <ZeuZ> I see it overlapped here
[19:38:06] <ZeuZ> ah I see
[19:38:08] <shoky> in which fiddle?
[19:38:17] <ZeuZ> http://jsfiddle.net/dendfqmn/1/
[19:38:38] <shoky> oh oops, was looking at the wrong one
[19:38:55] <shoky> and its cause i removed the part that adds the display:none
[19:38:59] <ZeuZ> the last one you pasted seems to be what I'm looking for though
[19:39:05] <shoky> cause you should use css files, not ugly style attributes
[19:39:21] <ZeuZ> :P
[19:39:27] <ZeuZ> I'm learning :P
[19:39:32] <ZeuZ> shoot me in the foot later :P
[19:40:21] <shoky> ;p
[19:41:02] <ZeuZ> if I were to pass a div as a parameter in the returned object, it should be startSlider: startSlider(div) right?
[19:41:31] <shoky> no
[19:41:39] <shoky> startSlider(div)  means call startSlider NOW
[19:41:45] <shoky> which you don't want ;p
[19:41:59] <shoky> why would you need to pass the div?
[19:42:09] <shoky> startSlider already has access to it
[19:42:36] <ZeuZ> Oh I see
[19:44:28] <BustyLoli-Chan> how do I parse.... ["<div class=\"trackback\"><h3>item<\/h3>item<br \/><\/div>","<div class=\"trackback\"><h3>aoeuaoeu<\/h3>aoeuaoeu<br \/><\/div>"]... into two separate elements?
[19:45:01] <BustyLoli-Chan> or like basically they are each a div... so if I load that and call data[0] and then try to set it's css will that work?
[19:45:35] <shoky> they are each a string of html, not a div ;p
[19:46:02] <BustyLoli-Chan> so how do I convert them?
[19:46:41] <shoky> $(data[0])  would parse it and wrap it in a jquery object
[19:47:05] <BustyLoli-Chan> :O
[19:47:22] <shoky> or..  $(somewhere).append(data[0])  would append the div to wherver
[19:47:41] <shoky> cause .append takes an html string
[19:48:02] <BustyLoli-Chan> is there no way to append a jquerp object?
[19:48:23] <shoky> yea, with append or appendTo
[19:48:30] <shoky> $(data[0]).appendTo('#somewhere')
[19:48:45] <shoky> $('#somewhere').append(data[0])  or $('#somewhere').append( $(data[0]) )
[19:48:45] <BustyLoli-Chan> oh, you said it takes an html string so I thought maybe that was the only option lol
[19:49:03] <shoky> ah nope sorry, it takes html, or jquery obj, or dom element. check the docs ;p
[19:52:06] <BustyLoli-Chan> is there a way to slide all the other elements down when I prepend something?
[20:26:27] <BustyLoli-Chan> slide toggle wont unhide my elements after using "hide()" on them
[20:26:30] <BustyLoli-Chan> am I doing it wrong?
[20:26:35] <robertmaxrees> show us what you're doing.
[20:27:02] <BustyLoli-Chan> nevermind I see it... I'm an idiot
[20:42:58] <paulz> hi
[20:43:06] <paulz> is there an alternative to jQuery.parseJSON
[20:43:14] <robertmaxrees> what do you mean?
[20:43:35] <robertmaxrees> i mean, there's https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/parse
[20:46:18] <paulz> i stock information like this in a key in session storage: [{"contactCategoryId":1,"name":"Autre"},{"contactCategoryId":2,"name":"Justice"}] and i would like read value... actually i do $(jQuery.parseJSON with each
[20:46:37] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[20:47:10] <robertmaxrees> you mean you $.each(jQuery.parseJSON(theData), function() {});?
[20:47:52] <paulz> $(jQuery.parseJSON(category)).each(function () {...
[20:48:01] <robertmaxrees> that's not the right way to do that.
[20:48:16] <robertmaxrees> if you want to use a jquery iterator, you want to use what i just showed you.
[20:48:31] <robertmaxrees> $().each() is meant for jquery objects only.
[20:48:53] <robertmaxrees> $.each() is meant for other types of objects.
[20:49:29] <paulz> actually, i store information like this JSON.stringify(json) in sessionStorage
[20:49:43] <robertmaxrees> that's fine.
[20:49:52] <robertmaxrees> you still need to use the $.each() i showed you.
[20:50:00] <robertmaxrees> you're using the wrong each, basically :)
[20:56:05] <paulz> to loop on the value, find the one we want and exist is still the same way?
[21:07:38] <mozzarella> I need help
[21:12:23] <paulz> specify your problem if you want help
[21:20:17] <jak2000> paulz: http://jsfiddle.net/jamiguel77/LLfouzdx/8/
[21:25:34] <jak2016> paulz: http://jsfiddle.net/jamiguel77/LLfouzdx/8/    when the user capture in qty2 i need make a math operation: qty1-qty2 = qty3 how do it? in this sample is 2 rows, but would be 300 rows.... any advice paulz?
[21:27:46] <paulz> a solution, could be when qty2 lost focus, get previous td - current td and write value and the next td
[21:28:53] <jak2016> yes
[21:28:58] <jak2016> i am thinking n keyup
[21:28:59] <ZeuZ> is there any function that returns the ammount of divs inside a container div?
[21:29:24] <jak2016> event, but i try something, in the jQuery code, and not luck by moment
[21:31:23] <ZeuZ> nevermind, overlooked length
[21:33:16] <hydraidm801> how can I clear an element of all it's attributes and then make new ones?
[21:37:16] <paulz> if you a in second td, you can use .prev() closest
[21:39:41] <paulz> > hydraidm801 you mean you have <div id="test>.... </div> and you want to clear all the stuff in the div?
[21:40:14] <hydraidm801> sorry I forgot about .attr()
[21:41:09] <hydraidm801> paulz, no I'm changing a submit button's attributes after submit to create a bootstrap popover to prompt the user to go back to the form they came from
[22:01:22] <ZeuZ> http://jsfiddle.net/cco298ox/ ---> why does the animation not work?
[22:30:25] <ZeuZ> better yet seen here: http://jsfiddle.net/cco298ox/2/
[23:01:11] <fas3r> which class do I have to use to be able to use .show() / .hide() ?
[23:06:58] <ZeuZ> you-re getting something along the lines of m.easing[this.easing] is not a function?
[23:14:38] <ZeuZ> http://jsfiddle.net/cco298ox/2/ --> why does it say jQuery.easing[this.easing] is not a functino and stops execution?
[23:14:49] <ZeuZ> I've done a test including jquery-ui and it says the same
[23:14:54] <ZeuZ> I included it AFTER jquery
[23:32:09] <jak2000> paulz?
