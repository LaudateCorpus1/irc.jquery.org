[03:38:56] <tilerendering> any opinions from you ppl about the jquery “validation plugin”? I think it s poorly documented and I suspect it to be heavily buggy
[08:18:11] <grid-> question, i'm getting close on this, but i'm still mussing something: https://jsfiddle.net/rxshuy0e/ i need to get the text(); of the country column that is on the same row as the text of the contact column
[08:26:15] <Cork> grid-: $(this).closest('th').find('th').last() should work
[08:26:22] <Cork> opps
[08:26:33] <Cork> i meant $(this).closest('th').find('td').last() should work
[08:28:41] <grid-> Cork: i know that it will work that way
[08:28:44] <grid-> but
[08:28:56] <grid-> that will just get the last child, it will not use the search, i've made this because my api generates the table columns
[08:29:10] <grid-> contact and country column can have different places on the table that's why it uses the searches for it
[08:35:18] <Cork> grid-: https://jsfiddle.net/5wkdfv9p/1/
[08:35:27] <Cork> is how i would recommend solving it
[08:35:42] <Cork> unless your ok with adding a class to the target td that is (the most efficient way to do it)
[08:36:22] <Cork> also worth mentioning, i recommend not using content text for selectors, it makes translating the page later very annoying
[08:41:15] <grid-> ah yes, i've adapted a little change to the fiddle, this is the resulti think like you said: if not using the class) https://jsfiddle.net/rbw67saf/ is this correct?
[08:41:55] <Cork> no, that won't find anything
[08:42:02] <Cork> as country isn't an element
[08:42:43] <Cork> only way to search for content is to loop the matched elements
[08:42:56] <Cork> (yet another reason it is a bad idea)
[08:44:17] <Cork> also, about the api generation, if it generates the entire table you will have multiple problems
[08:44:35] <Cork> as i made structure changes to make the header selectable in a reliable maner
[08:44:42] <Cork> (added the thead and tbody)
[08:47:16] <grid-> yeah the actual table on the production server has got a thead and tbody too
[08:47:32] <grid-> atleast, the table that's being generated by the api
[08:49:58] <Cork> if you really REALLY have to select based on the theader content you can use https://jsfiddle.net/gx7ka4qe/
[08:50:20] <Cork> but i strongly recommend beeing very careful with that selector, us it only if you don't have another choice
[08:50:48] <Cork> (and "server need to be updated" is one of those choices)
[08:51:00] <Cork> is it fradgile and slow
[08:54:18] <grid-> hmm ok
[08:56:35] <grid-> why it is fradgile?
[08:57:18] <Cork> cause it depends on content, instead of values designed for selecting
[08:57:35] <Cork> so ex. translation of the content will make them break
[08:57:45] <Cork> or adding spaces or formation or...
[08:57:54] <Cork> aka. fradgile
[09:05:02] <grid-> Cork: ok
[09:05:08] <grid-> i minified it a little bit https://jsfiddle.net/w50v4xpn/
[09:55:39] <dimi1947> I am trying to use datepicker...I need to use the getDate method but I get this error:https://1drv.ms/u/s!AjCBrCpLQye-hSLbpugk5wAOTOw6    I do include the juery-ui file in my document
[09:56:40] <grid-> Cork: anyways, thanks for helping, i've really have to take the opportunity to better learn jquery
[09:57:00] <Cork> grid-: np
[09:59:02] <shoky_> dimi1947: that's not how you call a jqui method. you're just calling getDate as if it's a regular function..
[10:00:39] <shoky_> dimi1947:  jqobj.datepicker('getDate')  is how you call it
[10:02:12] <dimi1947> shoky_:I do not diagree with you...why though the code here https://jqueryui.com/datepicker/#date-range is like this(take a look at the source of select date range)
[10:02:18] <shoky_> and for detecting change you can use the onSelect option
[10:02:41] <shoky_> dimi1947: see line 32 there...
[10:03:21] <dimi1947> oops...I missed that critical info
[10:03:52] <dimi1947> so this function there is NOT the standard getDate method...correct?
[10:04:02] <shoky_> correct
[12:24:39] <leadgeek> I'm trying to add a class to a label via jquery.  Attempting $('#blah').find('label').addClass("hello") without error or success.
[12:24:58] <leadgeek> I can add these classes in the inspector js debug window and it does what I need it to.
[12:30:06] <leadgeek> errr...nevermind, I need to be searching in a parent. doh.
[20:19:03] <vacho>         var rawData = $.getJSON('https://board.oncoreinc.com:8443/driver/json');
[20:19:58] <vacho> var rawData = $.getJSON('URL'), what am I doing wrong? that url returns a json
[20:22:30] <shoky_> vacho: have you looked at the docs?
[20:28:22] <vacho> shoky_: yes.
[20:29:21] <vacho> shoky_: I want to replace line with with my ajax function below,
[20:29:21] <vacho> https://paste.ofcode.org/9vwVXihupjFxWZVisMB4iG
[20:31:32] <vacho> any ideas?
