[04:39:06] <Steveccc> just to ensure i havent missed anything - people used to use jqueryui to produce things like tabbed layouts but I believe that now its best to just make the solution in jquery and UI is end of life - is that correct?
[05:04:44] <Cork> Steveccc: many don't use ui for that; but no ui isn't eol
[06:18:12] <HewloThere> hey, i'm just a bit confused as to where i'm going wrong with the data? whenever i set that element to have the contents of the data it makes it say (#questions_body) "[object Object]"? (here is my code: http://paste.hewlothere.me/videluqaru.js )
[07:51:19] <Jestin> Hello! How can i execute a method AFTER an input has changed
[07:52:15] <Jestin> Nevermind, I didn't select the right class.
[10:17:55] <Renkineko> hi
[10:19:37] <Renkineko> do you know a good way to count tr not hidden, but without the selector :visible? My table is inside an accordion, and I need to count the tr "visible" (not hidden from the table point of view), but not necessarily visible on screen. I can do an each tr and check if the css property "display" is not none, but I was wondering if there is a "quicker" way?
[11:35:46] <rjCousineau> Hello, i have 'submit' event, that I want to e.preventDefault();  however, i want to first run $.get(url, function(data){ if(data){ e.preventDefault} }) however e is not in scope, so it doesn't work.  I'm not sure how I can pass the event to the callback
[11:39:06] <shoky> rjCousineau: you can pass e but that won't help because the submit would have already happened immediately.  you need to .preventDefault() before the $.get,  then in the callback if you want to submit, manually call .submit() on the form
[11:39:50] <shoky> rjCousineau: and if you want the .submit() call to not re-trigger your event handler, one easy way is to call .submit() on the <form> raw DOM element, not on the jquery object wrapping it.  e.g.  $('form')[0].submit()
[11:40:16] <rjCousineau> nice, that'll work. ty i'll try it
[11:40:51] <rjCousineau> I can also probably async: false
[11:41:01] <shoky> no, never ever do that, forget it exists :)
[11:42:23] <rjCousineau> lol ok
[11:50:51] <rjCousineau> shoky: that works, thanks
[12:59:00] <laceupyrboots> is there any way to use addClass to apply a class to items with an existing class? here's essentially what i'm trying to do https://codepen.io/weinbergmp/pen/ZwQeBW
[12:59:17] <laceupyrboots> or rather, grab them using their class rather than element type?
[13:02:34] <rjCousineau> if( $('#first').hasClass('drawer') ){ $('#first').wrap(); }
[13:03:01] <rjCousineau> or.. if( $('.drawer').attr('id') == 'first' ){ ... }
[13:04:42] <rjCousineau> $('#first, #second, #third').each( function(){ if($(this).hasClass('drawer')){ $(this).wrapAll(); }); });
[13:05:57] <laceupyrboots> rjCousineau before i even worry about wrapping, the issue i'm having is that i just can't add .drawer to any of the divs
[13:06:57] <rjCousineau> why?
[13:07:11] <laceupyrboots> that's what i'm wondering lol
[13:07:22] <rjCousineau> it's addClass() case sensitive
[13:07:28] <rjCousineau> oh. nm.
[13:07:44] <laceupyrboots> wait
[13:07:48] <laceupyrboots> i think i figured out that part
[13:08:57] <laceupyrboots> alright, that was a dumb punctuation error. let me try that last snippet you gave me
[13:11:57] <laceupyrboots> rjCousineau it's giving me an unexpected token error
[13:16:18] <rjCousineau> laceupyrboots: https://codepen.io/anon/pen/VgezOq
[13:17:16] <laceupyrboots> rjCousineau "Unexpected token, expected , (10:33)"
[13:18:19] <laceupyrboots> is it codepen? let me try it in a separate text editor
[13:19:03] <robertmaxrees> $this.wrapAll("<div class="wrappist"></div>"); is wrong
[13:19:38] <robertmaxrees> "<div class="wrappist"></div>" - swap the outer double quotes to singles.
[13:28:34] <laceupyrboots> robertmaxrees dang, i thought jquery was agnostic to quote types
[13:28:37] <laceupyrboots> THANK YOU
[13:28:43] <robertmaxrees> it's still javascript.
[13:33:54] <robertmaxrees> welp
[16:21:37] <jak2000> in a webdevelopment.... is posible to do: if the user sign in on my webpage, and after some time,, him not use the websystem, can i disconnect (send to login / pass webpage) after 2 minutes?
[16:24:51] <jak2000> other thing: https://jsfiddle.net/jamiguel77/ufbd1nqc/3/   <---- how to block the Header and can scroll in the body?
[18:11:20] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 for the signout thing: that's pretty common.  i'd do that in your backend though.
