[04:53:13] <michael1234> There is such documentation: https://api.jqueryui.com/position/
[04:53:13] <michael1234> Question: What do parameters of "options.using" callback actually mean and how to use them?
[04:54:17] <michael1234> I admin I don't understand above documentation, and I need an example.
[04:55:34] <michael1234> correction: I admit [...]
[07:15:07] <hassoon> guys does anyone know of a javascript plugin that creates and manages a whole image gallery system excatly like that example ?  https://snapppt.com/naughtygits
[09:22:08] <rynkk> oh hai
[09:27:58] <rynkk> Can anyone tell me why this throws ".fadeOut is not a function"? https://pastebin.com/eEPnbuwB
[09:35:38] <shoky> rynkk: probably $pageWrap is not a jquery object at the time that code runs. e.g. maybe it's a raw DOM element object
[09:37:31] <shoky> also, that's an oooooooooooooooold jquery version
[09:38:43] <rynkk> the other lib that I use only supports 1.4, its not that important anyway since its only a small project for university
[09:38:59] <rynkk> any clues how I could fix that issue?
[09:39:51] <shoky> not without seeing more code or a testcase.  but uh.. make sure $pageWrap is a jquery object at the time that code runs :P
[09:45:15] <rynkk> this is what the console logs from console.log($page-wrap): https://gyazo.com/0ff9d36f1f39b97a84fdde441efdd81b
[09:45:32] <rynkk> from line 8 in the pastebin
[09:45:50] <rynkk> :^)
[09:47:21] <shoky> rynkk: unexpand the '0' field, can't see the other properties on it
[09:48:10] <rynkk> https://gyazo.com/fcbf3540a93b2a656a9126cedfb6fbb6
[09:49:28] <shoky> rynkk: ya i think that's just an array with a DOM element inside, not a jquery object
[09:50:49] <shoky> rynkk: a hack workaround would be to do:  let $elem = $($pageWrap[0]);    then  $elem.fadeOut(...)
[09:51:14] <shoky> but ideally you'd fix wherever $pageWrap is being defined/assigned
[09:51:32] <shoky> (so that it's actually a jquery object)
[10:01:11] <rynkk> I found the issue :D
[10:01:38] <rynkk> hidden, deep in the body, they imported jquery3.x
[10:06:14] <rynkk> they being my project partners
[16:07:58] <balance> hi
[16:08:36] <balance> I try toget the width using $( document ).width() - but I get "Cannot read property 'scrollWidth' of null", I don't really get why, can someone gie me a hint?
[16:37:33] <Neo1> what is this mean () => {}?
[16:37:45] <Neo1> what is difference between () => {} and function?
