[01:27:41] <souravbadami> I'm getting Object {0: Object, httpstatus: 200, rate: Object} when logging json.data.
[01:28:54] <souravbadami> Can anyone point out the issue ? I need to use it like json.data[0].name
[01:31:51] <Uhkis> what's the issue?
[01:33:35] <souravbadami> The data has a key, 'name'. I'm unable to get it because the returned thing is an object. I tried JSON.stringify() but no luck.
[02:15:54] <Cork> souravbadami: so the value is inside "0"?
[02:16:05] <Cork> try json.data[0].name
[02:16:35] <Cork> opps you already tried that...
[02:17:03] <Cork> souravbadami: could you run console.log(JSON.stringify(json.data) and show the result?
[02:26:17] <souravbadami> Cork: It's solved. Thank anyway!
[02:26:58] <souravbadami> My json is in format --> {'':'', ..} and the json.data.length returns undefined.
[02:27:13] <Cork> ya, as objects don't have length
[02:27:17] <souravbadami> Is there a way to get the length ?
[02:27:21] <Cork> [] is an array and it does
[02:28:52] <souravbadami> How to do that ? Like var temp = []; temp.push(json) ?
[02:29:26] <Cork> you have to fix it server side
[02:29:38] <Cork> what you have there can't be represented as an array
[02:30:06] <Cork> that said, why do you need the length?
[02:30:32] <souravbadami> I need to iterate and get some data out of it and push it in a select box.
[02:30:51] <Cork> $.each(json.data, function(key, value) {});
[02:31:04] <Cork> that will give you each key and the value of that key
[02:31:38] <Cork> length doesn't make sense as objects aren't incrementals
[02:31:45] <souravbadami> Yep.
[02:43:09] <Rocky11> Hi all
[02:45:43] <Rocky11> I need your valuable support. I am working in a project in which i get magnetometer/gyrometer/accelerometer data in x ,y z angles .I need to plot in graph.Please suggest me the library for that.
[02:46:38] <Rocky11> Also i need to rotate the axis according to values received from hardware device
[02:50:32] <Cork> Rocky11: theres plenty of libs out there
[02:50:51] <Cork> i would personally look at one of the d3.js based ones
[02:51:05] <Cork> but flot is an alternative
[02:52:32] <Rocky11> Cork: Thanks for reply but i need to show user that device is tilted by some angle due to cyclone.Then how can i display it on webpage
[02:53:19] <Cork> Rocky11: either as a line graph with one line for each axis
[02:53:24] <Cork> or as a 3d graph
[02:53:44] <Cork> and that is why i suggested having a look at the different libs and picking one you like
[02:54:46] <Rocky11> Cork: Can i show 3d graph for my requirement? Can you suggest me the library for that?
[02:54:56] <Cork> i just did...
[02:56:55] <Rocky11> Cork: I am developing website that is used by farmers or workers ,They may be illiterate.So,I need the 3d view of device and their angles
[04:46:30] <Duikb00t> oh oh
[04:46:46] <Duikb00t> I try to validat all input fields inside a fieldset ... but seems I can't catch the empty ones
[04:47:49] <Duikb00t> fixed nvm
[04:47:56] <Duikb00t> not my day today , used div instead of class
[04:47:57] <Duikb00t> ><
[05:20:50] <Hannes__> hi I request one url then I do a action there, all goes fine then I want to repeat this action and it says error loading the page every time. When I refresh whole page I can do the action
[05:20:56] <Hannes__> Any chance to debug?
[05:22:57] <AdamPDotty> "do a action" console.log(action):
[05:25:08] <And1> Good morning. I'm trying for half an hour to un-jquery-fy this line of code. Could someone please help me? $(renderer.domElement).attr('id', 'home').css('height', height);
[05:29:26] <AdamPDotty> hmm, renderer.domElement.id= 'home'; renderer.domElement.style.height= height; ?
[05:30:01] <AdamPDotty> Actually you can not set an attribute with Script.
[05:30:21] <AdamPDotty> HTML attribute that is.
[05:31:26] <Hannes__> AdamPDotty: was this to me? if so where do I put it in browser?
[05:33:39] <AdamPDotty> We are a bit low on information here. I do not really have an idea, what you are trying to do.
[05:33:57] <And1> AdamPDotty: What do you mean with you cannot set an attribute?
[05:35:31] <AdamPDotty> Attribute is part of the text that is fed to the browser. The browser then renders the page from that text and the text loses any significance including attributes within it.
[05:35:56] <AdamPDotty> It is not part of the DOM.
[05:44:38] <And1> AdamPDotty: Hmm. Pity.
[05:45:32] <AdamPDotty> Nope, does not really matter. Its just, that in nearly all cases you should not use .attr() but .prop().
[06:06:58] <TheDude> I have a question
[06:07:06] <Duikb00t> good ask.
[06:09:02] <TheDude> I want check with Jquery if the a form html has the attribute "display:none"
[06:10:00] <AdamPDotty> language ..
[06:11:02] <AdamPDotty> "display" is a CSS property not a HTML attribute.
[06:12:10] <TheDude> I was thinking to something like: if($("#form").attr("style", "display:none").val() != null) { ....}
[06:12:23] <AdamPDotty> ouch
[06:12:47] <AdamPDotty> You probably want .isVisible();
[06:13:00] <TheDude> "display" is inside to style attribute. There is a way to check it?
[06:13:27] <AdamPDotty> Why would you want to do that?
[06:14:14] <AdamPDotty> ok, maybe it is spelled .is(':visible');
[06:14:55] <TheDude> if i remember "visible" is different from "display" property
[06:16:01] <TheDude> I need to do that because I have two elements that are mutually exclusive
[06:16:08] <AdamPDotty> Now what do you want? The property or the attribute?
[06:16:15] <Kovensky> document.getElementById('form').style.display
[06:18:18] <AdamPDotty> :visible checks for the css property display, no idea why
[06:19:38] <TheDude> <form id="form" style="display:none" > </form> How to check if "display" is "none" or a different value with jquey?
[06:20:10] <systemfault> You're looking at good solution to a bad design.
[06:20:21] <systemfault> s/at/for
[06:20:30] <systemfault> Can't you use a class instead?
[06:20:48] <systemfault> Then it's easy to do      if(myForm.hasClass('hidden'))
[06:23:10] <AdamPDotty> Ok, that would be way better.
[08:17:47] <Sourcey> Hello. Why is the new field added above the old ones in a table row here? https://jsfiddle.net/e32y27nu/1/
[08:19:25] <shoky> Sourcey: you can't have a <div> as child of <table>
[08:19:52] <Sourcey> ah, then how?
[08:20:24] <shoky> how what?
[08:21:01] <Sourcey> How to add a new tablerow? need some kind of reference inside it ?
[08:21:13] <shoky> you can have a <div> in a <td> if you want.  or you can add more <tr> to the table, not to a <div>
[08:21:53] <shoky> add rows to the table, not to a div.
[08:22:03] <Sourcey> thanks
[08:22:33] <shoky> also best if you have a <tbody> and add directly to that, otherwise you're counting on the browser to fix your bad html
[08:43:45] <varsha> I am a beginner and would like to work on jQuerry. I am also to ready to do relevant projects. At the present, I have just accumulated little knowledge  about javascript. I also know to work on a software development platform i.e, NetBeans  written in Java. How should I proceed in order to contribute to this community.
[08:47:46] <TheDude> I need to enqueue the jQuery UI into my code using  wp_enqueue_script()
[08:48:07] <TheDude> What is the correct link to use?
[09:02:01] <r3ply> can use the https://cdnjs.com/ one
[09:03:03] <mar77i> what options do I have to submit data without making an ajax request?
[09:04:06] <mar77i> I don't currently have a form tag and believe location = location.href is ugly.
[09:04:47] <shoky> mar77i doing anything on a page you don't control is ugly
[09:05:01] <AdamPDotty> You can create a form.
[09:05:03] <shoky> why not ajax?
[09:05:05] <shoky> and yeah ^
[09:05:12] <mar77i> I'll create a form.
[09:16:24] <mar77i> shoky: no worries, I have a different job now.
[09:19:50] <mar77i> one where I can actually add <form> tags. in a real template.
[09:59:59] <souravbadami> Any nette user here ?
[10:37:00] <momomo> keyup event.key is undefined in chrome browsr, not firefox .. any reason why?
[10:37:20] <momomo> is the ev.keyCode or ev.which different for various browsers ?
[10:37:45] <momomo> if not, why isn't not mapped through an hashmap to a consistent event.key value ?
[10:46:29] <taplar> iirc event.which is the one that jquery will make the same for you in all browsers
[11:41:45] <hello> hi
[11:42:23] <catbadger> hi
[11:42:23] <hello> I need to validate a form with required html5 fields and I want jquery to dont submit
[11:42:31] <catbadger> PMed
[11:42:47] <hello> ?
[11:43:22] <catbadger> i just sent you a PM with the answer to your question
[11:43:39] <catbadger> which for the rest of the room is getDaysInSpan
[11:43:42] <catbadger> derp
[11:43:59] <catbadger> $('formid').on('submit',function(e){e.preventDefault(); }
[11:44:28] <catbadger> I'm sure it would be on the top of a google search
[11:45:03] <hello> yeah, maybe
[11:45:06] <hello> thanks catbadger
[11:47:26] <catbadger> :) welcome
[11:47:32] * catbadger goes back to code reveiw
[12:22:17] <mike_papa> Hello. Will $.off("click.myNamespace") remove all click.myNamespace events from the whole document? "selector which should match the one originally passed to .on() when attaching event handlers." confuses me. I need to remove all click.myNamespace events, no matter what element they were bind to.
[12:23:00] <taplar> afaik, off is a jQuery.fn method.  you have to select something first
[12:23:37] <taplar> $(elementsWithTheEventBound).off('click.myNamespace');
[12:23:39] <mike_papa> Doesn't sound good. ;) Any idea how to remove those events in one line? There are few of them.
[12:24:03] <taplar> $('selector1, selector2, selector3, ...').off('click.myNamespace');
[12:25:29] <mike_papa> Should $('*').off('click.myNamespace'); work as well? Or selectors should match those used in .on? Sorry, but I don't get the whole mechanism yet.
[12:25:41] <taplar> sure, but that's very heavy
[12:25:49] <taplar> you should have an idea as to what it was bound to originally
[12:26:22] <taplar> i've yet to run into a case where $('*') was a good ida
[12:26:23] <mike_papa> I do, I'm asking in order to get the picture how it works.
[12:27:00] <mike_papa> Thanks taplar.
[12:27:08] <taplar> for each of the elements matched in the selector, $(thisThing), it executes the off() method on it, looking to see if there is an event handler bound to it for the event and if so, it removes it
[12:27:29] <taplar> optionally if you give it the eventHandler method originally provided, it will only remove that handler from the elements for that event
[12:28:09] <mike_papa> taplar: so I can attach more than one handler in the same namespace?
[12:28:15] <taplar> oh yeah
[12:28:38] <mike_papa> taplar: So what's the point of namespaces in this case?
[12:28:53] <taplar> *shrug*, plugin specific stuff i suppose
[12:29:15] <taplar> lots of plugins do that to allow for tie in logic to their internal processing
[12:29:34] <taplar> like, bootstrap modals have events around when they show/hide modals and such
[12:29:44] <taplar> you can bind to their custom events so you can do more when they happen.
[12:29:54] <taplar> just their way of letting you tie in to the process
[12:30:29] <mike_papa> taplar: ok. Yeah, I didn't think of plugins.
[12:30:34] <momomo> taplar, yes, but isn't it wierd that event.key isn't mapped properly ?
[12:30:52] <momomo> from event.which to key = 'p' for instance
[12:31:08] <helpplease> Question:  Can I do selection like $(#mydiv_[top,bottom,side,another,etc]) to select all elements matching id of mydiv_top, mydiv_bottom, etc?  If so, can someone point me to the manual on this or give me a reference selector to look at?  Thanks in advance
[12:31:10] <taplar> momomo: afaik that's one of the browser specific event properties, so it may or may not be set
[12:31:22] <taplar> which is why the which property exists and is normalized
[12:31:32] <momomo> i am bypassing this by manually providing a which to key mapping, but i felt as if jqueyr should already be doing htis
[12:31:33] <momomo> this
[12:31:45] <taplar> helpplease: no, that's invalid.  [] in selectors is for attribute selections
[12:31:55] <momomo> taplar, but thank you
[12:32:10] <helpplease> Thanks taplar, I didnt think so, but was hoping for a shortcut instead of comma separating them
[12:32:20] <taplar> helpplease: put a class on them and call it a day, :)
[12:32:42] <helpplease> Taplar, fair enough, thanks :)
[12:32:53] <taplar> bbs, going to lunch
[14:22:21] <Z3R0> anyone here used jQuery File Upload https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload ? having issues
[14:22:27] <Z3R0> brb (feel free to PM)
[14:22:31] <robertmaxrees> ...
[14:22:31] <robertmaxrees> lol
[14:22:37] <robertmaxrees> just ask your question to the channel :)
[14:27:47] <benlieb> What is the easiest way to animate a scroll to el#with_id? I have jquery and jquery ui loaded and would prefer not to add additional libraries.
[14:28:19] <taplar> jquery ui has a scrollTo iirc
[14:28:39] <Z3R0> sorry had to leave… my issue is I am trying to use the Basic UI Plus, but anytime I select a file, the table for files isn’t being populated…
[14:28:42] <robertmaxrees> base jquery does, too.
[14:29:05] <taplar> i didn't think the core one animated it though
[14:29:10] <taplar> *shrug*
[14:29:34] <Z3R0> no console errors, I turned autoupload off… but can’t figure out why it’s not populating the table
[14:29:52] <robertmaxrees> oh, yeah, you need to use animate with base jquery.
[14:30:04] <robertmaxrees> Z3R0 really hard to help without a fiddle or something.
[14:33:09] <benlieb> taplar: not finding that: https://jqueryui.com/?s=scrollto
[14:33:22] <Z3R0> woot finally got an error: TypeError: $this.data(...)._renderExtendedProgress is not a function // grrrr
[14:33:33] <taplar> yeah i may have got the actual method name wrong
[14:35:45] <taplar> benlieb: in regards to what robert said http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4034659/is-it-possible-to-animate-scrolltop-with-jquery#4034674
[14:36:16] <benlieb> taplar: yeah, I've made something similar
[14:36:20] <benlieb> $('html, body').animate({ scrollTop: $('#how_works').offset().top }, 800, function(){ });
[14:36:20] <Z3R0> https://gist.github.com/SeoRoman/d286e6f91749e31ee9e29685f4b92488 // there’s a gist, don’t know what else I could have done wrong...
[14:36:35] <benlieb> taplar: I just thought that might be built in somewhere
[14:36:57] <taplar> i really thought there was one, but i'm not finding it in ui or mobile.  *shrug*
[14:58:58] <taplar> anyone ever worked with dynamic datalists?
[15:09:49] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/5wp9d2o1/
[15:11:39] <taplar> i've tried doing focus, tried changing the value and changing it back.  nothing, :(
[15:11:48] <taplar> it hates me
[15:14:35] <Captain_Haddock> Hi, I have two textareas side by side and I'd like to provide a coloured diff comparing the too. Is this possible? Any existing plugins?
[15:19:01] <shoky> taplar: didn't understand what you want to happen
[15:20:06] <taplar> the user types a character in the input box, which causes the datalist to be rebuilt.  after which the typical dropdown should display showing the new options.  i can't get it to do the final part.
[15:21:11] <taplar> it's, expectedly, evaluating the input on the values before they are modified.  i'm just trying to see if i can get it to open for the new values
[15:21:12] <shoky> works for me..? i think
[15:21:14] <shoky> @ chrome
[15:21:21] <taplar> hmm, let me switch
[15:23:02] <taplar> huh, it's not even showing the options for me in chrome.  i see it gets a dropdown arrow, but it doesn't expand. :s
[15:23:21] <shoky> huh.
[15:23:38] <shoky> i type 'a' and  a second later the arrow + options appear
[15:23:46] <taplar> v53 ?
[15:23:55] <shoky> 54
[15:23:58] <shoky> on windows
[15:24:30] <shoky> but ya not really working on firefox
[15:25:00] <taplar> i think i'm starting to see why most autocomplete plugins do some sort of floating div or something instead of a datalist, heh
[15:25:42] <shoky> ya "html5" is not quite there yet ;p
[15:27:49] <arc_> if it still isn't working in all newest versions of major browsers, it's going to be a long time before i'd use it on anything major : /
[15:28:09] <shoky> heh wtf, on firefox if i put the mouse cursor above one of the options and press delete key, it deletes the option
[15:28:39] <shoky> or if i select it, doesn't need to be with mouse
[15:29:58] <taplar> i think i'm starting to see why most autocomplete plugins do some sort of floating div or something instead of a datalist, heh:/
[15:30:01] <shoky> taplar though  https://jsfiddle.net/5wp9d2o1/1/
[15:30:01] <taplar> crap, sorry
[15:30:28] <shoky> don't need the setTimeout even
[15:30:34] <taplar> oh that worked
[15:31:01] <taplar> oh you just didn't detach
[15:31:05] <taplar> ?
[15:31:25] <shoky> and no timeout, but i guess it's the no detaching that was important
[15:31:46] <shoky> didn't see why you were doing it so i removed it
[15:32:07] <taplar> it's going to be dynamic from an ajax call in the real case
[15:32:30] <shoky> dynamic content sure, why move the datalist itself around the DOM though
[15:32:30] <taplar> and i was doing empty with out a detach and it was looking bad as you could see them be removed one by one and then it would grow back out
[15:32:47] <shoky> oh
[15:33:06] <shoky> wait what
[15:33:11] <taplar> hold on
[15:34:12] <shoky> brb/bbs
[15:34:24] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/ncov8wje/27/ <-- larger fiddle
[15:35:23] <taplar> ln 64 is the rebuild method
[15:36:22] <taplar> if you type in 'ap' it does the weirdness as it empties and rebuilds
[15:36:44] <taplar> which i got to stop doing with the detach, update, and insert.  but that fked up the display as the value changed
[15:51:48] <robertmaxrees> sorry - so you need to get the current active slide?
[15:52:10] <BenMerkley> yeah just so i can do items like 1 of 2 2 of 2 etc
[15:52:13] <BenMerkley> and np
[15:52:56] <robertmaxrees> flickity.metafizzy.co/api.html#jquery-fn-data-flickity
[15:53:20] <robertmaxrees> so then you just need the event listener for when it goes to a slide.
[15:53:33] <robertmaxrees> luckily for you: http://flickity.metafizzy.co/events.html\
[15:53:40] <robertmaxrees> no need to watch for mutation evemts
[15:54:11] <BenMerkley> robertmaxrees: issue is when i use those events it creates a new skideshow
[15:54:18] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[15:54:22] <robertmaxrees> how are you using them?
[15:54:35] <BenMerkley> Via a drupal module is the slide show is already created
[15:54:46] <robertmaxrees> that shouldn't make any difference.
[15:55:14] <robertmaxrees> you mean because you don't have a reference to the carousel itself?
[15:55:50] <BenMerkley> I cant access those events i dont think
[15:55:55] <robertmaxrees> sure you can.
[15:56:01] <robertmaxrees> they probably behave like all others.
[15:56:07] <robertmaxrees> that's why they're namespaced.
[15:56:16] <BenMerkley>     var $carousel = $('.flickity-slider').flickity();
[15:56:17] <BenMerkley>       var flkty = $carousel.data('flickity');
[15:56:26] <robertmaxrees> err.
[15:56:27] <robertmaxrees> no no
[15:56:29] <BenMerkley> Those functions cause the carosel to be created again
[15:56:35] <robertmaxrees> you don't use it like that.
[15:56:51] <robertmaxrees> var $carousel = $('.flickity-slider');
[15:56:56] <robertmaxrees> then use everything else the same way.
[15:57:06] <robertmaxrees> the events should totally work the same.
[15:57:34] <BenMerkley> im thinking XD
[15:58:07] <BenMerkley> Sorry i dont quite understand
[15:59:47] <robertmaxrees>  var $carousel = $('.flickity-slider');
[15:59:52] <robertmaxrees> just change that first call to this.
[15:59:56] <robertmaxrees> then everything else is the same.
[16:00:08] <robertmaxrees> $carousel.on('whatever.event', function() {});
[16:00:49] <BenMerkley> Please hold testing this
[16:00:51] <BenMerkley> ty robertmaxrees
[16:00:56] <BenMerkley> ++
[16:01:02] <BenMerkley> robertmaxrees ++
[16:02:20] <robertmaxrees> tjhat work?

[16:04:44] <al_nz1> if I have an event on a element in a panel, and based on that event I want to find the next occurence of a different element, is find the function that I want
[16:05:32] <taplar> next(selector) possibly
[16:06:03] <robertmaxrees> BenMerkley are you asking for permission orrrr did you try orrr....?
[16:06:06] <al_nz1> does $(this).find('whatever') only search 'this'?
[16:06:13] <taplar> ya, children
[16:06:16] <robertmaxrees> ....
[16:06:19] <robertmaxrees> what else would it search?
[16:06:35] <BenMerkley> sorry yeah i tried it broke the slider
[16:06:36] <al_nz1> well I tried :
[16:06:43] <robertmaxrees> BenderRodriguez "it broke the slider" how?
[16:07:27] <BenMerkley> robertmaxrees:  sorry it didnt break it that code didnt print anything
[16:07:39] <robertmaxrees> and you're adding it AFTER the carousel loads?
[16:07:41] <BenMerkley> or log anyhting in the console
[16:08:00] <al_nz1> $(this).parents('.panel-body').find('whatever') and even though the selection now includes what I am looking for it didnt find it (what I am looking for is a child of something in panel-body
[16:08:18] <robertmaxrees> try $('body').on('settle.flickity', function() { console.log('foo') }); BenMerkley
[16:08:32] <taplar> al_nz1: is that literally what you did?
[16:08:40] <taplar> cause 'whatever' isn't a valid tagName
[16:08:42] <robertmaxrees> al_nz1 make a jsfiddle duder.
[16:08:48] <robertmaxrees> show us actual codef.
[16:09:15] <BenMerkley> aaaaaaaah robertmaxrees
[16:09:21] <al_nz1> ok. standby
[16:09:33] <robertmaxrees> BenMerkley gotta make sure it binds after the stuff exists :)
[16:09:47] <BenMerkley> robertmaxrees: if i meet you irl i owe you a beer
[16:09:52] <robertmaxrees> lol
[16:09:56] <robertmaxrees> don[t bind to body fwiw.
[16:10:02] <robertmaxrees> but yeah, just needed to read a little :)
[16:21:28] <robertmaxrees> aaaaah i'm so sick of coldfusion
[16:22:23] <al_nz1> trying to get this into a fiddle is a nightmare
[16:22:45] <robertmaxrees> al_nz1 ...
[16:22:49] <robertmaxrees> you don't need the entire page.
[16:22:54] <robertmaxrees> it's called a test case for a reason.
[16:23:14] <al_nz1> no I need only a snippet
[16:23:23] <al_nz1> but that snippet needs various bits to work
[16:23:23] <robertmaxrees> so why is it a nightmare.,
[16:23:27] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[16:23:29] <robertmaxrees> lol
[16:23:33] <robertmaxrees> your question was about DOM traversal.
[16:24:31] <robertmaxrees> you could go super basic for that.
[16:24:31] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/gfye7gjo/
[16:24:33] <robertmaxrees> like this.
[16:24:53] <robertmaxrees> so you need, what, the next <li> after the current one?
[16:24:54] <robertmaxrees> or what?
[16:26:57] <al_nz1> try this : https://jsfiddle.net/arjtnb33/15/
[16:27:12] <al_nz1> I think it explains what I want to do
[16:28:00] <robertmaxrees> okay.
[16:28:01] <al_nz1> I tried $(this).parents('.panel-body').find('.col-sm-4.school') but that didnt find
[16:28:02] <robertmaxrees> so first off.
[16:28:05] <robertmaxrees> this is WAY too complicated.
[16:28:17] <robertmaxrees> you have a ton of includes in the wrong place.
[16:28:23] <robertmaxrees> way too much markup, etc.\
[16:28:40] <robertmaxrees> this is where you gotta simplify.
[16:29:47] <al_nz1> ok
[16:29:56] <robertmaxrees> take a look at the fiddle i shared.
[16:30:05] <robertmaxrees> same basic idea, right?
[16:30:21] <robertmaxrees> you want to bind a handler that finds the next sibling of a parent element?
[16:30:32] <cannap> it marks all links as readed
[16:30:34] <cannap> ;D
[16:30:59] <al_nz1> robertmaxrees: yes, I think that is what I want to do
[16:31:22] <al_nz1> but why doesnt my way work? the target element col-sm-4.school is in the parent
[16:31:38] <robertmaxrees> i'm not going to look at your example tbqh.
[16:31:44] <robertmaxrees> because it's WAY overcomplicated :)
[16:32:07] <al_nz1> what because of too many divs?
[16:32:15] <robertmaxrees> and includes.
[16:32:19] <robertmaxrees> and other unrelated stuff.
[16:32:27] <robertmaxrees> gotta boil your problem down to the basics, yo :)
[16:33:36] <taplar> closest('.panel-body').find('.school')
[16:33:44] <robertmaxrees> that's not really what he wants though.
[16:33:45] <robertmaxrees> :)
[16:34:30] <taplar> no clue. just going off his lookup attempt
[16:34:41] <robertmaxrees> :) he's trying to find the next element of a parent.
[16:34:51] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/gfye7gjo/1/
[16:35:35] <taplar> by his markup though they're not siblings, if he's after school
[16:35:42] <al_nz1> I just want to hide the school, but from a jquery learning perspective I cant work out why find isnt finding .school - cause it is in parent
[16:35:52] <al_nz1> I am printing parent to the console darn ir
[16:35:53] <al_nz1> it
[16:36:57] <al_nz1> https://snag.gy/RKdgDI.jpg
[16:37:03] <robertmaxrees> ...
[16:37:03] <robertmaxrees> lol
[16:37:05] <robertmaxrees> good luck duder.
[16:38:29] <al_nz1> robertmaxrees: I get it that evidently the html is bloated, but never the less, I still would like to know why the jquery I am trying isnt working as expected
[16:38:40] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/arjtnb33/16/ :/
[16:39:33] <robertmaxrees> al_nz1 part of the learning experience is being able to simplify what you're doing to as basic of a test case as possible.
[16:40:06] <robertmaxrees> a fiddle with over 500 lines of html kind of negates a simplified test case.
[16:41:36] <al_nz1> why the heck does your find work
[16:41:42] <taplar> *shrug*
[16:41:44] <robertmaxrees> lol
[16:41:46] <al_nz1> I know I was using parent instead of closest
[16:41:55] <robertmaxrees> .parents() or .parent() ?
[16:41:56] <al_nz1> but closest and parent got the same thing
[16:42:00] <al_nz1> parents
[16:42:06] <robertmaxrees> those are different fwiw.
[16:42:11] <al_nz1> but closest and parents were giving the same thing
[16:42:41] <robertmaxrees> shouldn't make a difference in this case.
[16:43:02] <al_nz1> I was using '.col-sm-4.school' too as my find
[16:43:14] <robertmaxrees> she us the actual JS you were using.
[16:43:19] <taplar> personally i avoid selecting by bs classes
[16:43:20] <taplar> heh
[16:43:30] <robertmaxrees> ^^^ this is a big one.
[16:45:41] <al_nz1> bs classes?
[16:45:47] <robertmaxrees> bootstrap classes
[16:45:47] <taplar> bootstrap
[16:46:04] <taplar> they may work, but it does very little to add readability to your code
[16:46:10] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[16:46:12] <BillCriswell> .col-sm-4 is no good, .school is good
[16:46:18] <robertmaxrees> ^^^^^^^
[16:46:22] <robertmaxrees> .school means something.
[16:47:38] <al_nz1> ok
[16:47:41] <al_nz1> point taken
[16:47:47] <robertmaxrees> semantic markup and all that.
[16:48:41] <al_nz1> so .school matches any class with school in it, ie class=something school class=school and class=something else school
[16:48:52] <robertmaxrees> yep.,
[16:48:53] <al_nz1> its not like it needs to be fully qualified
[16:48:57] <al_nz1> ok - cool
[16:50:22] <taplar> prior to querySelector or querySelectorAll, single class is probably more performant too, if i had to guess
[16:51:12] <taplar> dunno how querySelectorAll compaires to getElementsByClass
[16:51:23] <robertmaxrees> probably about the same.
[17:17:48] <al_nz1> brb
[17:23:30] <dglambert> yo
[17:24:10] <taplar> hola
[17:24:26] <verax5> return response()->json(['name'=>'1234567890']);
[17:24:27] <dglambert> Hey, is it possible to place an OR on child selectors. EX show me all A's and Buttons that are descendants of .MyClass
[17:24:34] <verax5> how do i targert that in jquery man?
[17:24:47] <verax5> response['name'] wont work
[17:24:49] <verax5> says undeifned
[17:24:58] <robertmaxrees> verax5 what's the actual data?
[17:25:02] <taplar> dglambert: $('selector1, selector2')
[17:25:11] <verax5> just this robert: return response()->json(['name'=>'1234567890']);
[17:25:11] <robertmaxrees> the JSON the brower is getting i mean
[17:25:11] <taplar> comma separated is a logical OR
[17:25:18] <robertmaxrees> verax5 that's not json then.
[17:25:22] <verax5> ohh one sec
[17:25:41] <dglambert> I can't separate the descendant though can I?
[17:25:50] <taplar> what do you mean?
[17:25:53] <dglambert> like $('.myClass a,button,input')
[17:25:56] <verax5> seems like json, Robert:
[17:25:57] <verax5>  t { url="getRequest",  ok=true,  status=200,  more...}
[17:26:05] <robertmaxrees> tjat's not valid JSON either.
[17:26:07] <verax5> bodyObject { name="1234567890"}
[17:26:12] <taplar> dglambert: you can give it whatever selectors you want
[17:26:14] <dglambert> I don't think that will do what I think I intended
[17:26:20] <verax5> oh wait thats just part of it, one secon
[17:26:32] <robertmaxrees> verax5 actually look at the response and copy/paste it into a jsfiddle or something.
[17:26:38] <taplar> $(parentSelector).find('chlid1Selector, child2Selector')
[17:26:46] <dglambert> it would have to be $('.myClass a, .myClass button, .myClass input')
[17:27:09] <dglambert> taplar, fair, I was thinking that as I was typing my answer
[17:27:26] <dglambert> I was more curious though if i could do it using the jquery selector syntax
[17:27:40] <taplar> both of those are the same selector syntax
[17:27:49] <taplar> just doing it in one call vs two
[17:27:52] <verax5> robert this is what im getting in 'Response' tab: {"name":"1234567890"}
[17:28:11] <robertmaxrees> verax5 so what's your actual ajax call look like?
[17:28:17] <taplar> $(parent).find('child1, child2') may be more performant though
[17:28:34] <dglambert> that is equivalent to
[17:28:42] <dglambert> $('.myClass a, .myClass button, .myClass input')
[17:28:55] <robertmaxrees> yes, but easier to read.
[17:28:55] <taplar> right but i'm not sure how sizzle handles that vs the find() one
[17:29:00] <verax5> Robert well its Vue: http://pastebin.com/wPjXcHKH
[17:29:08] <dglambert> sorry, sizzle?
[17:29:10] <taplar> sizzle may refind the .myClass for each of those ors
[17:29:17] <robertmaxrees> dglambert that's the selector engine.
[17:29:17] <taplar> Sizzle is the lookup engine jquery uses
[17:29:18] <dglambert> oh ok
[17:29:21] <dglambert> oh
[17:29:37] <robertmaxrees> verax5 response.name
[17:29:38] <taplar> you want to try to use it as little as possible, :)
[17:29:42] * sizzle selects robertmaxrees 
[17:29:44] <robertmaxrees> assuming i'm reading this correctly.
[17:29:53] <dglambert> so your thinking the sizzle syntax is more performance intensive
[17:30:01] <robertmaxrees> *know
[17:30:08] <robertmaxrees> but don't worry about perf.
[17:30:12] <robertmaxrees> worry about readability
[17:30:16] <taplar> no, jquery will use sizzle if it can't shortcut the lookup
[17:30:23] <dglambert> ok
[17:30:33] <taplar> but yeah, readability is king
[17:30:36] <drej> didnt jquery 2 drop sizzle in favour of queryselector
[17:30:44] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[17:30:44] <verax5> robert that gives me undefined
[17:30:47] <dglambert> I guess my question was more along the lines, I can't write  a query liek this:
[17:30:51] <robertmaxrees> verax5 no idea then man.
[17:30:51] <verax5> console.log(response.name)P;
[17:30:56] <taplar> query selector doesn't do the pseudo lookups afaik
[17:31:02] <dglambert> $('.myClass (button, input, a)')
[17:31:03] <verax5> i think it has to do with vue
[17:31:11] <robertmaxrees> it defers to QSA, etc when it makes sense it.
[17:31:29] <taplar> dglambert: no
[17:31:37] <taplar> dglambert: not if you want it to work, :)
[17:31:52] <dglambert> ok so I think using the parent find solution is probably the most readable
[17:32:03] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[17:32:12] <dglambert> ok thanks for your help
[17:32:21] <robertmaxrees> verax5 try typeof response
[17:32:24] <robertmaxrees> wht do you get?
[17:33:33] <verax5> robert: if i do typeof response i get Object
[17:33:43] <verax5> if i do typeof response.name i get : undefined
[17:33:49] <robertmaxrees> right.
[17:34:04] <robertmaxrees> so do console.log(response); and then use the explorer to poke around.
[17:34:20] <verax5> this is what  response contains: http://pastebin.com/fgq0eP1m
[17:34:43] <taplar> wth
[17:34:51] <robertmaxrees> name is nested in body duider
[17:34:55] <robertmaxrees> response.body.name
[17:35:33] <taplar> guess that's from some php framework
[17:35:46] <robertmaxrees> probably.
[17:35:47] <verax5> vue tap
[17:35:53] <taplar> ah
[17:36:28] <verax5> shit it worked now
[17:36:58] <robertmaxrees> so your example from earlier and the actual data were very different.
[17:36:59] <robertmaxrees> fwiw
[17:37:41] <verax5> robert response tab only showd key value until i echoed the data on console
[17:37:49] <robertmaxrees> verax5 wut
[17:38:04] <verax5> lol i meant response tab showed name: 122342432
[17:38:13] <robertmaxrees> that's not helpful.
[17:38:16] <verax5> but when i consoled the 'response' it shows whole bunch of objects
[17:39:04] <robertmaxrees> i can't believe i'm about to say this, but screenshot of the response tab.
[17:39:11] <taplar> :o
[17:39:16] <verax5> lol bruh
[17:39:16] <verax5> k
[17:40:11] <verax5> robert: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/28490184/Screenshot%20from%202016-10-19%2022-39-44.png
[17:40:40] <verax5> brb one sec. this vue framework is messed up it seems
[17:40:42] <robertmaxrees> 5 bucks says it;'s a different request than the one you're looking at.
[17:40:52] <verax5> hmm
[17:40:54] <taplar> loading loading loading
[17:40:57] <robertmaxrees> also: the builtin dev tools are so much better than firefox these days.
[17:41:09] <robertmaxrees> err, firebug
[17:41:17] <verax5> robet my inspect element is messed up  remember lo
[17:41:22] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[17:41:25] <robertmaxrees> i don't remember,.
[17:41:27] <robertmaxrees> heh
[18:03:22] <verax5> think ima try angular
[18:03:38] <verax5> vue doesnt seem to have much support
[18:04:09] <robertmaxrees> wut
[18:04:14] <robertmaxrees> vue has tons of support i thought.
[18:04:21] <taplar> that's one vue of the situation
[18:04:27] <robertmaxrees> LEL
[18:05:04] <verax5> irc: dead
[18:05:08] <verax5> stackoverfow: dead
[18:05:09] <verax5> http://stackoverflow.com/search?q=vuejs
[18:05:19] <verax5> people interested making new tuts: ded
[18:06:00] <robertmaxrees> weird.
[18:06:09] <robertmaxrees> i know the framework is getting more popular.
[18:06:54] <verax5> i think its cool for people who're already experienced with other front end frameworks
[18:07:07] <verax5> for someone new to frontend frameworks cant learn everything form docs
[18:07:26] <robertmaxrees> have you written much in just raw native JS?
[18:08:06] <verax5> ye was like years ago then i went on php streak and forgot about js lol
[18:08:33] <verax5> was long time ago
[18:08:33] <verax5> https://github.com/phpdevsami
[18:09:48] <robertmaxrees> heh
[18:17:39] <verax5> i wrote some js lol but im shit at it
[18:17:39] <verax5> https://github.com/phpdevsami/Registration-Login-Password-Recovery-and-Password-Changing-system/blob/master/registration/js_form_validator.js
[18:17:56] <robertmaxrees> what's with the weird whitespace?
[18:18:20] <verax5> i think its tab lol
[18:18:33] <verax5> i shoud have used normal spaces instead i think
[18:18:37] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[18:18:46] <robertmaxrees> i mean the tabs in the middle of lines.
[18:20:01] <verax5> well
[18:20:02] <verax5> n 18 Jun 2015
[18:20:07] <verax5> dont remember lol
[18:20:54] <verax5> anyways
[18:20:58] <verax5> gonna try angular
[18:21:08] <verax5> seems solid framework
[18:21:22] <robertmaxrees> eeeh
[18:21:25] <robertmaxrees> i'd go with react these days.
[18:21:29] <robertmaxrees> but angular's a choice.
[18:22:53] <verax5> ya use reach yourself?
[18:23:28] <robertmaxrees> we're converting to it.
[18:23:56] <verax5> o
[18:24:13] <verax5> form anguar to react?
[18:24:18] <verax5> from*
[18:24:25] <robertmaxrees> from backbone to react.
[18:24:47] <verax5> : O
[18:24:52] <verax5> damn all these frameworks
[18:24:59] <robertmaxrees> they all have different jobs.
[18:25:03] <verax5> i applied for php job other day
[18:25:03] <robertmaxrees> amd different strengths.
[18:25:07] <verax5> failed the test rip
[18:25:15] <verax5> yee im starting to see it robert
[18:25:36] <verax5> i never understood when people say, use this framework for this, use that one for this
[18:25:44] <verax5> i mean like.. what about the learning curve
[18:25:53] <verax5> cant just feed it into my brain
[18:25:54] <robertmaxrees> at a certain point, there really isn't any.
[18:26:07] <robertmaxrees> you just gotta know the language and the paradigm for the framework.
[18:26:09] <robertmaxrees> the rest is easy.
[18:31:09] <verax5> i see
[18:34:52] <verax5> ya work fr company?
[18:34:57] <verax5> or contractor?
[18:35:14] <taplar> for his wife
[18:35:22] <robertmaxrees> lol
[18:35:23] <robertmaxrees> basically.
[18:35:26] <robertmaxrees> nah i work for a company.
[18:36:37] <verax5> man being developer without marketing skills is so pointless if you cant find a job
[18:37:10] <taplar> marketing skills?
[18:37:33] <verax5> for example, i builld an app
[18:37:40] <verax5> but cant market it, make it popular
[18:37:44] <verax5> make income off it
[18:37:51] <taplar> ah
[18:38:00] <taplar> that's when you get a partner
[18:38:45] <taplar> plus I would assume hopefully there was some lead up research as to how the market was in regards to needing such a product, ;)
[18:38:56] <BenderRodriguez> robertmaxrees: whaT?
[18:39:07] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[18:39:26] <verax5> well lol
[18:39:31] <verax5> i didnt do no research
[18:39:32] <robertmaxrees> BenderRodriguez ?
[18:39:39] <verax5> actually i did a bit
[18:39:43] <verax5> but nobody uses my tool
[18:39:48] <verax5> locksec.xyz
[18:39:50] <taplar> amen fatha
[18:39:52] <verax5> :ded:
[18:39:54] <verax5> ded
[18:40:54] <taplar> so it's like a private messaging service?
[18:41:10] <noob_on_rails> can you sort results in jquery autocomplete based on something? other than alphabetically, like say popularity or some kind of priority ?
[18:41:13] <verax5> ye taplar
[18:41:33] <verax5> for exampe you could lock message for me
[18:41:34] <verax5> ecc516c12e15a8d74cc36963f94331ab
[18:41:38] <verax5> on that hash
[18:42:16] <verax5> and it will be accessible on only my ip
[18:42:40] <robertmaxrees> noob_on_rails iirc yeah, there's a weight or something.
[18:42:44] <arc_> seems a bit restrictive. i guess if you're using vpn it doesn't matter
[18:42:55] <arc_> or ssh
[18:43:15] <taplar> i assume there is security to keep someone from pretending to be someone else?
[18:43:58] <verax5> well if they have access to your pc
[18:44:04] <taplar> and it's based off of ip?  what about people with non-persistent ips?
[18:44:17] <BenderRodriguez> robertmaxrees: ?
[18:44:20] <verax5> taplar
[18:44:21] <BenderRodriguez> robertmaxrees: you pinged me
[18:44:25] <verax5> craon runs every 60 mins
[18:44:25] <robertmaxrees> i did?
[18:44:28] <BenderRodriguez> yes
[18:44:29] <BenderRodriguez> you did
[18:44:31] <BenderRodriguez> ...
[18:44:33] <BenderRodriguez> why did you ping me
[18:44:39] <robertmaxrees> oh.
[18:44:42] <robertmaxrees> bad autocomplete.
[18:44:43] <robertmaxrees> sorry mang.
[18:44:46] <noob_on_rails> weight hm ok
[18:44:48] <BenderRodriguez> oh ok
[18:44:52] <taplar> so short term message storage
[18:44:52] <verax5> so message wiped after 60 mins
[18:44:58] <BenderRodriguez> try not to let it happen again
[18:45:00] <BenderRodriguez> ...
[18:45:02] <Croves> I want to reset the form and set the focus to the first field everytime a modal is shown. This is my code, but the `focus()` isn't working https://dpaste.de/9bV2
[18:46:26] <taplar> Croves: the form is a child of the modal?
[18:46:51] <Croves> taplar: yes. Every modal has it's own form...
[18:47:04] <taplar> put "debugger;" right before the focus()
[18:47:17] <taplar> check to make sure that the first element is not a hidden input or something
[18:47:27] <taplar> or just that it is correct in general
[18:48:18] <taplar> also side note, store $(this) in a variable and reuse that variable
[18:48:55] <taplar> and you can reuse 'form' when finding the 'first'
[18:49:40] <taplar> and put var in front of those variables
[18:49:42] <taplar> lol
[18:49:44] * taplar is picky
[18:50:35] <Croves> lol sorry, python dev here adventuring itself in jquery
[18:50:39] <Croves> like this? https://dpaste.de/xQcX
[18:51:00] <taplar> yeah!
[18:51:14] <Croves> still not working, and there's no hidden field in the form
[18:51:21] <Croves> actually, the hidden field is the last one
[18:51:41] <taplar> hmm, so in your inspector that pops up when you run it if you put 'first' in your console what prints?
[18:52:43] <taplar> mmm, i may have an idea
[18:52:47] <Croves> taplar: `[<input type=​"text" class=​"form-control" name=​"txtInvoiceNumber" min=​"0" max=​"99" placeholder=​"99" required>​]`
[18:52:56] <Croves> it's the right field
[18:53:05] <taplar> ok, i wonder if it's because your doing it on 'show.bs.modal'
[18:53:29] <taplar> iirc that fires before it is actually shown.  shown would be like 'shown.bs.modal' or something  *is double checking*
[18:54:00] <Croves> duude
[18:54:12] <Croves> taplar: I changed `show` to `shown` and it's working!
[18:54:18] <taplar> boom
[18:54:27] <taplar> can't focus on a hidden element, :)
[18:54:31] <taplar> err, invisible
[18:54:36] <Croves> makes sense...
[18:54:38] <taplar> you get what i'm saying
[18:55:14] <Croves> thank you, taplar =)
[18:55:22] <taplar> up, show is before it's actually shown
[18:55:23] <taplar> np man
[19:02:02] * taplar presses the big red button
[19:09:34] <dglambert> anyone know if I will fuck up GA by handing it a null value for label or value?
[19:52:22] <jabbott> This is posting to machines/index as a DELETE instead of posting to the clicked id say 2 to DELETE machines/2:  http://laravel.io/bin/jQLE3  What am I doing wrong?
[22:01:07] <Croves> So, when I type some text in a input and press enter, I use jQuery to send that text to a table, and a icon on the same row. I want to click in this icon and remove this line. I'm using a class to identify that icon and I'm doing: `$('i.productRemove').on('click', function(event) { alert('hi'); });. But it doesn't work
[22:01:13] <Croves> But if I paste this code in console, it works
[22:03:37] <Croves> This is my code: https://dpaste.de/fcGm
[22:21:18] <Croves> Anyone?
[22:26:27] <ngharo> so you add a row to a table then you want to remove it?
[22:29:16] <ngharo> use the delegated syntax: $('#txtInvoiceProduct').on('click', 'i.productRemove', function(event) { alert('hi'); });
[22:29:38] <ngharo> instead of alert consider using console.log in all case
[22:41:52] <superguest> hih
[22:43:22] <superguest> https://jsfiddle.net/x7qdp2dj/
[22:43:43] <superguest> The console reports that this.prop is not a function
[22:44:42] <systemfault> "this" is a pure DOM node, you need to wrap it with jQuery to use .prop
[22:44:43] <Kovensky> this is the HTMLElement, not a jQuery object
[22:44:50] <systemfault> $(this) to wrap it
[22:46:02] <superguest> great.  it fixed it!
[23:10:03] <superguest> I have a follow up question, to my earlier https://jsfiddle.net/x7qdp2dj/1/ post
[23:11:47] <superguest> it's more of a JS scope questions.  why does the callback function still has access to 'nSelected'?  Isn't it outside its scope
[23:12:33] <duch_kazatel> i misswed the original question.
[23:12:37] <duch_kazatel> mind sharing the code?
[23:12:40] <superguest> https://jsfiddle.net/x7qdp2dj/1/
[23:13:10] <robertmaxrees> nope.  you define nSelected in a parent scope.
[23:13:27] <robertmaxrees> also: you don't need a variable to hold that information in the first place.
[23:14:01] <robertmaxrees> also also: you should use the change event instead :)
[23:15:44] <superguest> robertmaxrees, can you explain?  I am still unclear.  while nSelected was defined in parent scope, but isn't that out of the callback's scope?
[23:16:02] <superguest> robertmaxrees, it's not like it's the parent who invoke the callback
[23:16:16] <robertmaxrees> it has nothing to do with invocation and everything to do with definiton.
[23:16:55] <robertmaxrees> basically, a scope has access to all variables from all parent scopes.
[23:17:51] <robertmaxrees> if you defined that in anything other that a "parent" scope, it would then not be accessible.
[23:19:23] <superguest> robertmaxrees, oh... that's where closure (using the wrap-it-around-with-a-function trick) comes ey...
[23:19:33] <robertmaxrees> sort of, yeah.
[23:23:14] <duch_kazatel> woops
[23:46:54] <holycrunchitz> what's up?
[23:47:10] <robertmaxrees> not much.
[23:47:12] <robertmaxrees> yourself?
