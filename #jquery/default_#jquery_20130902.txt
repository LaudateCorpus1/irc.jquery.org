[00:08:06] <Karliky> pranavrc if you are using the file:// protocol i will not work
[00:08:20] <Karliky> you should create a local webserver
[00:09:24] <pranavrc> Karliky, is there a workaround other than that? Will $.support.cors fix anything?
[00:09:42] <Karliky> you can start google chrome with command line arguments
[00:09:49] <Karliky> are you on Windows? mac? linux?
[00:09:56] <pranavrc> linux
[00:10:06] <Karliky> ok
[00:10:51] <Karliky> start the process with this flag --disable-web-security
[00:10:58] <Karliky> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3102819/chrome-disable-same-origin-policy
[00:11:16] <pranavrc> Karliky, so if I move the file to a server which serves static files with nginx, this would work?
[00:12:02] <pranavrc> this as in the normal ajax call to a local file, without the workaround
[00:14:05] <Karliky> yes it should work
[00:14:33] <pranavrc> Karliky, alright, thanks!
[00:14:40] <Karliky> :)
[00:33:41] <jop008_>  $("#price_" + oweeks[torow].rowID]).val ( oweeks [torow].weekprice ); error unexpected ]
[00:33:52] <jop008_> but where is the error?
[00:34:34] <jop008_> found
[01:47:45] <EdwardIII> hey, is there a way i can get the json response back from .ajax's statusCode callback?
[01:48:51] <fgh> u can, the callback function's params are similar to success/error
[01:49:13] <fgh> the json response would be the first param in a success callback
[01:49:51] <dfos> Why does this not show alert? function prefillSelectElement() {    // console.log("hi from console");     alert("prefill"); }();
[01:51:30] <EdwardIII> fgh: it seems to be different from .success though
[01:52:02] <Cork> dflurker: the syntax for the autoexecuting function isn't valid
[01:52:04] <seutje> EdwardIII: the first argument is the jqXHR containing the responseText
[01:52:04] <EdwardIII> according to the docs, statusCode (default: {})
[01:52:17] <EdwardIII> Type: PlainObject
[01:52:30] <Cork> dfos: !function prefillSelectElement() { alert("prefill"); }(); or (function prefillSelectElement() { alert("prefill"); })();
[01:52:31] <EdwardIII> hrm, so i can process that responseText into json using JSON.parse?
[01:52:42] <seutje> I suppose
[01:52:56] <fgh> EdwardIII, the 2nd part of the docs for that says
[01:53:20] <seutje> EdwardIII: the docs say that because the ajax function expects that to be an object with keys like '404'
[01:53:22] <fgh> If the request is successful, the status code functions take the same parameters as the success callback
[01:54:48] <fgh> dfos, or according to mr crockford, (function prefillSelectElement() { alert("prefill"); }());
[01:56:29] <dfos> thanks fgh
[01:57:16] <dfos> Cork: thank you too. btw i used second. what is the not operator in your first invocation
[01:57:36] <Cork> dfos: ya, i prefer that one my self too
[01:57:43] <fgh> yw dfos
[02:00:14] <Cork> dfos: opps missed the question in there
[02:00:32] <Cork> dfos: the () and ! is to help the parser know it should execute the code
[02:01:06] <Cork> dfos: !function(){}(), (function(){})() and (function(){}()) all do this
[02:01:28] <Cork> dfos: only real difference is that you can't get a return value other then a boolean from the first one
[02:01:44] <Cork> (and it will be reversed from what is output in the function)
[02:03:10] <dfos> Cork: appreciate your explaining
[02:22:36] <abraxsi> Hi guys, I've published a jquery plugin for the first time. It would be great to get feedback on how easy it is to understand/how useful it might be to people. http://lukesargeant.com/jquery/listplus/demo.html - i would appreciate if anyone would like to take a look.
[02:22:40] <le_gars> Hi, quick question about removeClass(). If applied will it also remove all css effects that is applied on that class?
[02:23:18] <Cork> le_gars: uh, that isn't something you need to do manually
[02:23:26] <le_gars> Scenario: I have a class erorr that is styled red. If I do $('.error').removeClass() will that remove the red styling as well
[02:23:34] <Cork> le_gars: if you remove a class the class isn't affecting the element
[02:24:07] <le_gars> Cork: How do you mean that is not something that I need to do manually?
[02:24:32] <Cork> le_gars: like i said, if a class isn't added to an element, the class doens't affect the element
[02:25:15] <Cork> le_gars: the styling is something the browser generates when it prepares to render the element
[02:26:03] <Cork> le_gars: so the only situation you get a styling on an element, that isn't defined in a css rule, it's directly inline in a style attribute
[02:26:53] <le_gars> Alright. Is that a good way of doing it? What I would like to do is when my form is submitted I clear it out. I can reset the input with val('') but wanted to also remove the class that marks it red if invalid
[02:27:26] <abraxsi> le_gars: use $('.error').removeClass('error'); ?
[02:27:26] <Cork> le_gars: the clearing of the form is normally best handlerd with a .reset() on the form
[02:27:39] <Cork> and yes the classes is just to remove
[02:27:46] <le_gars> ok cheers guys
[02:29:52] <didiergm> Hi - need an advice - I have a JQM app using localstorage to store several entries in a form whilst the tablet is offline. This works fine. Now the user wants to be able to store drawings as well drawings being much larger than simple texts I'll run out of space too quickly but I am confused by the different file APIs
[02:31:05] <didiergm> MY idea would be to let the use draw on a canvas - store the result on the local filesystem and then when the tablet in again online get back to the save files and send then
[02:31:24] <didiergm> any pointers to get me started I am utterly confused right now
[02:31:57] <dfos> The ajax here gives not response and so does alert. Any idea what am i missing here? http://bpaste.net/show/ANvCJxKrSLl8PPs5KUyt/
[02:31:59] <didiergm> note everybody uses the latest mobile Chrome
[02:32:07] <dfos> respond*
[02:32:35] <le_gars> Cork: One quesiton though, I get a: Object [object Object] has no method 'reset' when I try to call .reset()
[02:32:58] <le_gars> should I not be able to do: $('#my_form').reset() ?
[02:33:04] <Cork> le_gars: $('form')[0].reset()
[02:33:14] <le_gars> a, because it is native js?
[02:33:22] <le_gars> and not jquery
[02:33:23] <le_gars> ?
[02:33:26] <Cork> native dom function yes
[02:33:29] <fgh> dfos, is your request url returning valid json?
[02:33:33] <le_gars> ok great cheers
[02:34:06] <Cork> dfos: add a fail callback
[02:39:10] <ryzzan> how am i supposed to clean the post data after using .post?
[02:39:39] <Cork> ryzzan: clear what data?
[02:40:01] <ryzzan> data sent by .post
[02:40:14] <Cork> why would you need to clear that up?
[02:41:30] <ryzzan> cuz i'm using it to get some "returns"... and these r "acumulating" (i don't even know if there is such a word in english - brazilian, sorry)
[02:42:00] <Cork> ryzzan: sounds like your using global (undefined) variables
[02:42:10] <seutje> sure there is, but I believe it's with 2 C's
[02:42:34] <ryzzan> ty, seutje
[02:43:52] <ryzzan> Cork, i'm using .post with .serialize
[02:43:55] <Cork> ryzzan: so if you need help, the code is needed
[02:43:59] <ryzzan> that's how i'm gettinf the data
[02:44:18] <Cork> ryzzan: then are you appending html to the page?
[02:45:07] <Cork> ryzzan: anyway the answer to your question is: you, don't; and you don't have to
[02:45:08] <ryzzan> i'm using this post data with php code, and it returns specific results, according to what is sent...
[02:45:17] <Cork> ryzzan: so your are doing something wrong somewhere else
[02:45:31] <ryzzan> i want these result to be "cleaned" when i use .post .serialize once again
[02:45:41] <Cork> then you need to show the code
[02:46:18] <ryzzan> just a sec
[02:47:28] <ryzzan> http://moderatoro.com/testing/n-moderatoro/
[02:47:46] <ryzzan> just write anything to try to login n u r going to c what i'm talking about
[02:48:33] <ryzzan> oh... my friend is messing around there
[02:48:35] <ryzzan> just a sec
[02:48:39] <Cork> uh
[02:49:02] <jop008_> to update a value in a selectbox can I use .val ("choice");?
[02:49:03] <Cork> so you are injecting jquery and validacao.js everytime the #fullscreen element is clicked
[02:49:08] <Cork> that sounds wrong to start with
[02:49:13] <Cork> jop008_: yes
[02:51:53] <ryzzan> Cork, the #fullscreen element is not about the login area, but the register...
[02:52:10] <Cork> ryzzan: well i just say you will have a problem there too
[02:52:14] <ryzzan> ok
[02:52:20] <ryzzan> :)
[02:52:21] <ryzzan> ty
[02:52:33] <ryzzan> but i'm changing everything around tehres, actually
[02:52:41] <ryzzan> n i'm stating with the login
[02:52:42] <Cork> ryzzan: the problem is with postPHP
[02:52:53] <Cork> ryzzan: you call it every time someone clicks the button
[02:53:06] <Cork> so you will have one additional event listener for every click
[02:53:30] <Cork> so .submit is called 1,2,3,4,5,6,... times as you click the button
[02:53:54] <ryzzan> would u gimme a solution?
[02:53:58] <Cork> ryzzan: so just statically run the even listener on page ready, and skip the inline code
[02:54:11] <ryzzan> ok
[02:54:12] <ryzzan> ty
[02:54:15] <Cork> np
[02:55:25] <tat_> i have a problem with bxslider, i am trying to stop it when i click a button, so i call slider.stopAuto(), on the debug console it works but inside my click function it doesn't any idea why not ?
[03:02:44] <abraxsi> tat_ if using Chrome, use the Sources tab and select the script with your click function. put a break point in the code where you run slider.stopAuto() then perform the click in the browser to run that code. Chrome inspector will pause your code at the break point - you'll then be able to hover over variables to check that they are instantiated. It can often help in figuring out whether your variable is null or out of scope etc.
[03:05:25] <tat_> abraxsi: how do i set a breakpoint if the script is embedded in the page ?
[03:06:35] <tat_> abraxsi: well googled it allready
[03:06:49] <abraxsi> k
[03:26:00] <amitprakash> Hi, small issue.. i have a piece of jquery as $('#subitem_table>tbody>tr:first').before(table_row);
[03:26:10] <amitprakash> however, this only works when the table has at least one row
[03:26:38] <amitprakash> How can I change it to work when the table has 0 or more rows?
[03:28:04] <Cork> amitprakash: prepend?
[03:28:07] <Cork> ?api prepend
[03:28:12] <b-ot> Cork: .prepend(): Insert content, specified by the parameter, to the beginning of each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/prepend/
[03:28:28] <seutje> amitprakash: var $table = $('#subitem_table > tbody'), $table.prepend(table_row); ?
[03:28:28] <Cork> $('#subitem_table>tbody').prepend(table_row)
[03:28:54] <Cork> also the > is most likely not needed
[03:29:03] <seutje> might have nested tables
[03:29:03] <Cork> so $('#subitem_table tbody').prepend(table_row)
[03:29:19] <seutje> or is it "may have ..." ?
[03:29:20] <Cork> ya, but most times you don't
[03:31:07] <xqo> can i run a jquery-function once a css-animation is complete?
[03:31:21] <Cork> yes
[03:31:28] <Cork> use the animationend event
[03:31:34] <Cork> (it differs for browsers)
[03:31:40] <Cork> ?g mdn animation end
[03:31:41] <b-ot> Cork: Using CSS transitions - Web developer guide | MDN → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/CSS/Using_CSS_transitions
[03:31:48] <Cork> ?g mdn animationend
[03:31:49] <b-ot> Cork: animationend - Web technology reference | MDN → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Reference/Events/animationend
[03:32:04] <xqo> $(this).bind("animationend", function(...) ?
[03:32:26] <Cork> (notice the no
[03:32:31] <Cork> well no and yes :)
[03:32:39] <Cork> that works for blink and ff
[03:32:46] <Cork> but the other browsers has prefixed names
[03:33:31] <Cork> xpo: bind('transitionend oTransitionEnd otransitionend webkitTransitionEnd'
[03:33:42] <Cork> that should get you covered
[03:33:51] <Cork> the o prefix can most likely be dropped
[03:34:03] <Cork> (the browser is eol anyway)
[03:34:26] <xqo> ah
[03:34:27] <xqo> thank you!!
[03:36:12] <Cork> opps saw i gave you the wrong event name first :x
[03:36:22] <tat_> this is really strange i use the a public function from bxslider inslide a click event, but the click works just one time, it seems like the bxslider call destrois the clicj event
[03:36:54] <Cork> tat_: it might replace the dom element with something from an html string for example
[03:49:11] <abraxsi> So guys, I've published a jquery plugin for the first time. It would be great to get feedback on how easy it is to understand/how useful it might be to people. http://lukesargeant.com/jquery/listplus/demo.html - i would appreciate if anyone would like to take a look.
[03:50:52] <sneakyness> خ ̐̐̐خ
[03:55:02] <Tingle> I have this weird issue that this js file is requested everytime my page reloads (//www.google.com/recaptcha/api/js/recaptcha_ajax.js), but for a differnt library it doesnt (//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.10.2/jquery.min.js) is there a reason for this?
[03:57:36] <Tingle> nvm figured it out: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14500337/recaptcha-javascript-caching
[04:10:43] <dfos> .append() with options does not work. What could be wrongly done? http://bpaste.net/show/S90c1mh997GmBmSqzHp1/
[04:16:50] <reuf> hello all
[04:17:09] <sneakyness> خ ̐̐̐خ
[04:19:41] <reuf> I have something like this -> <div class="mydiv">     <div><h3>Text</h3></div>     <div><h3>Text</h3></div>     </div>  <- i want to get all "Text" within h3 elements - how do i do it?
[04:20:02] <seutje> dfos: append takes either a string, element, jQuery collection or function
[04:21:40] <dfos> seutje: forgot I have this statement above .each(); var mySelect = $('#revenue_head');
[04:21:47] <seutje> dfos: also, each's parameters are index and referenced element
[04:22:08] <seutje> dfos: what are you trying to accomplish?
[04:23:07] <dfos> seutje: I want to append option elements to select which has both text and value as array value
[04:23:27] <dfos> the option value and text i mean
[04:25:33] <seutje> dfos: like this? http://jsfiddle.net/3dC32/
[04:26:06] <seutje> second argument to each is a reference to the element, so u have to extract the text content from it first
[04:29:59] <seutje> reuf: $('h3').map(function(e, el) { return el.textContent ? el.textContent : el.innerText }).get();
[04:30:29] <seutje> should result in an array with all their text in the order they were encountered
[04:31:01] <seutje> ref: http://jsfiddle.net/3dC32/2/
[04:32:31] <sneakyness> خ ̐̐̐خ
[04:32:43] <reuf> seutje, thanks
[04:35:20] <Cork> seutje: what are you rewrapping the responses in a new jquery object if you don't want it?
[04:35:58] <seutje> didn't want to polyfill array.map
[04:36:11] <seutje> and I gotta query to get the h3s anyway
[04:36:14] <Cork> no i meant $('h3').map(function(e, el) { return el.textContent ? el.textContent : el.innerText }).get(); vs $.map($('h3'), function(e, el) { return el.textContent ? el.textContent : el.innerText })
[04:36:33] <seutje> guess that would be better
[04:36:50] <Bish> im asking this question for the third time now, can anyone tell me how to detect location changes á la facebookgraph?
[04:36:50] <dfos> should .append mandatorily be wrapped $(document).ready(function() { }) ?
[04:37:12] <dfos> and why round brackets around document keyword?
[04:37:19] <seutje> nothing should, unless it's being run from the head
[04:37:21] <dfos> wrapped in*
[04:37:49] <seutje> dfos: it wraps the document object in a jQuery object, allowing for extra methods, like ready()
[04:38:34] <seutje> u could also just write it as $(function(){ ... })
[04:41:05] <seutje> dfos: doc.rdy basically cause the function you pass in there to run only when the DOM is ready. placing your scripts at the bottom of the body element, will cause them to be executed when the DOM is already ready, so no need to bind it to the "event" then
[04:41:42] <seutje> dfos: here's a better explanation: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4643990/jquery-is-document-ready-necessary
[04:44:23] <nevvermind1> about that link, seutje
[04:44:30] <nevvermind1> someone says "document.ready is not the same as the onload event, where images and other external assets have finished loading."
[04:44:42] <seutje> sounds legit
[04:44:47] <nevvermind1> so what's ready? dom only?
[04:44:50] <seutje> yea
[04:45:25] <seutje> but do note that there's issues with the load event for images
[04:45:41] <nevvermind1> yeah, i know
[04:45:52] <nevvermind1> just wanted to clarify the dom readiness thing
[04:51:13] <Krambiorix> hi, i have a div which is filled by jquery after the DOM is setup ... How can i wait and when the div is filled, execute a function?
[04:51:32] <Krambiorix> I tried $('#container_items').load() but that is never executed
[04:52:04] <chachan> guys, I have a checkbox which changes status logically but visually is not changing at all, any idea?
[04:54:24] <seutje> Krambiorix: generally, you can assume it's applied instantly
[04:55:42] <Krambiorix> seutje, hmmm, it's not applied
[04:56:29] <Krambiorix> seutje, this works : $('#container_items').ready( function() {
[04:57:11] <gvo> chachan: Something is reseting it programmatically?
[04:57:45] <seutje> chachan: got example?
[04:58:06] <seutje> Krambiorix: erm, what?
[04:58:20] <seutje> probably fires instantly
[04:58:25] <chachan> gvo, have no idea, We are using a template. I don't see anything "weird", but there's a jQuery code binded to click and toggle
[04:58:33] <chachan> seutje, let me paste some
[04:59:48] <gvo> chachan: Remove the binding and see what happens.  If it works normally after that then the bound code is reseting the  control.
[05:04:46] <Krambiorix> seutje, hmm yeah, doesn't work
[05:05:30] <seutje> Krambiorix: if all else fails, u could use it as a promise or even modify append to fire an event or accept a callback function
[05:05:36] <chachan> gvo, I tried that but didn't work
[05:05:56] <seutje> Krambiorix: like $.when($(foo).append(bar)).then(function(){ ... });
[05:06:13] <chachan> I see it can change value successfully when I do this: document.getElementsByName('template')[0].checked
[05:06:19] <Krambiorix> seutje, hmm i don't know if that can be use
[05:06:21] <Krambiorix> *used
[05:06:38] <seutje> Krambiorix: here's an example on how you can duck-punch append to fire an event when it's done: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7167085/on-append-do-something
[05:06:42] <seutje> its*
[05:06:50] <seutje> no, it's after all!
[05:06:54] <gvo> chachan: When you removed the bind did it still not work?
[05:07:24] <Krambiorix> :D
[05:07:39] <seutje> sure, make fun of my grammars!
[05:08:45] <Krambiorix> seutje,  :D   ,    ok got it
[05:09:05] <chachan> gvo, you're right. Still doesn't work. I unbind the event with $(':checkbox').off('click') and $(':checkbox').off('toggle')
[05:10:04] <seutje> chachan: you're just assuming this would catch all events?
[05:10:08] <gvo> chachan: actually I meant remove any and all event handling of the element.
[05:10:17] <seutje> isn't it possible that something is bound higher up and delegated
[05:10:21] <seutje> ?
[05:10:24] <Bish> is there any event that get's fired when a ajax call is finished?
[05:10:25] <gvo> I agree.
[05:10:38] <seutje> ?ajaxcomplete
[05:10:56] <seutje> lazybot
[05:10:58] <seutje> Bish: http://api.jquery.com/ajaxComplete/
[05:11:13] <chachan> hm ok, got that. So I should do something like $(':checkbox').off() ?
[05:11:22] <Bish> what if the ajax wasn't done by jquery?
[05:11:59] <seutje> Bish: then you're fucked :D
[05:12:07] <Bish> :(
[05:12:26] <seutje> might be a way, but I dunno
[05:12:45] <seutje> Bish: is it an option to react to what the ajax request's success handler does?
[05:13:17] <Bish> well im not working on a page directly, im writing browser plugins, which means i generally doesn't have access to those
[05:13:55] <seutje> Bish: actually, u could override the base XMLHttpRequest constructor
[05:14:21] <Bish> as far as i can recall, you don't have any access to the pages javascript
[05:14:24] <Bish> at all
[05:14:42] <seutje> yeah, then I'm afraid I dunno
[05:14:53] <chachan> I did this: $(':checkbox').off() And still having the same behavior =/
[05:14:59] <seutje> might be some special interface available to extensions though
[05:15:02] <chachan> gvo, seutje ^
[05:15:07] <seutje> chachan: that doesn't actually do anything
[05:15:26] <seutje> http://api.jquery.com/off/
[05:15:30] <seutje> the first argument isn't optional
[05:15:56] <seutje> 'To remove specific delegated event handlers, provide a selector argument. The selector string must exactly match the one passed to .on() when the event handler was attached. To remove all delegated events from an element without removing non-delegated events, use the special value "**"."
[05:16:49] <chachan> seutje, yeah, but first example doesn't have any argument. That why I tried with that
[05:17:28] <chachan> but I also tried with ('click', '**') and ('toggle', '**'), nothing changes
[05:20:03] <chachan> what's weird is that logical value does change when I check/uncheck it
[05:23:48] <dfos> what does this semantically mean?  alert($("[id=mySelect]").length);
[05:24:15] <seutje> alert the number of elements with that ID
[05:25:01] <seutje> chachan: oh wait, guess the docs are off, it doesn't mention that the first argument if optional :o
[05:25:25] <seutje> but yeah, like I said, it might be bound to a higher element and delegated
[05:25:31] <dfos> seutje: [] for array isnt it?
[05:25:44] <chachan> gvo, seutje is it possible that a checkbox can be unchecked visually but checked logically?. Haven't seen that before
[05:25:46] <seutje> dfos: nah, in a selector it's used for attributes
[05:27:06] <seutje> chachan: wait a second, is this a regular checkbox or like a jQuery UI widget or something?
[05:27:34] <seutje> dfos: http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/attribute-selectors/
[05:27:58] <abraxsi> Can someone check out my plugin page and see if they think it is useful? It's the first jQuery plugin i've published: http://lukesargeant.com/jquery/listplus/demo.html - does anyone know any good ways for a plugin to start to get traction? should I be submitting it to review websites etc?
[05:28:18] <chachan> seutje, it's the bootstrap one
[05:28:21] <dfos> thanks seutje
[05:28:38] <chachan> could it be that the reason?
[05:28:52] <seutje> yeah, that is definitely the reason
[05:29:06] <seutje> it doesn't show the actual checkbox, but instead makes the label look like one
[05:29:15] <seutje> so u'll also need to change the active class on the label
[05:30:23] <seutje> usually like $checkbox.prop('checked', true).closest('label').addClass('active')
[05:30:39] <seutje> where $checkbox is a reference to the jQuery collection containing the checkbox(es)
[05:30:51] <chachan> so checkbox from bootstrap doesn't work out of the box?
[05:32:06] <seutje> that's an odd conclusion to make
[05:32:46] <seutje> prolly sufficient to just trigger change on it, dunno how bootstrap's internals work
[05:34:35] <seutje> chachan: when I try manually toggling the checkbox on http://getbootstrap.com/components/ the visual representation updates just fine o.O
[05:37:56] <seutje> just go to http://getbootstrap.com/components/#input-groups-checkboxes-radios and enter this in the console: document.querySelector('[type="checkbox"]').checked = !document.querySelector('[type="checkbox"]').checked;
[05:39:40] <dfos> My alert($("[id=mySelect]").length) is 0. How do I ensure it is 1?
[05:40:56] <abraxsi> make sure there is an element with an id of mySelect. however, usually with id you would use $('#mySelect')
[05:41:16] <T13|needsCoffee> dfos: why not $( '#mySelect' ).length ?
[06:04:25] <ph88> does someone know how i can give some visual feedback to the user when Select2 ajax can not return any results (not found)  ??
[06:07:01] <TheGallery> ph88 do you mean like, when ajax fails to load the content of your select element?
[06:07:26] <ph88> no i mean when i search for a keyword and the database can not five back any results
[06:07:34] <ph88> five -> give
[06:08:43] <gvo> ph88: perhaps supply and error function to your ajax call?
[06:09:18] <seutje> ph88: formatNoMatches
[06:09:29] <gvo> ph88 the ajax should either call success or error function.
[06:09:46] <ph88> thx seutje
[06:10:31] <seutje> gvo: it's a plugin that passes on the options you pass it, so u can;t directly get at the ajax call
[06:11:20] <seutje> the ajax call itself doesn't provide a way to give it an error handler, but it does include a callback option to use for rendering the "no results" result
[06:11:29] <seutje> so you could easily "abuse" that
[06:11:35] <gvo> seutje: OK I think you can but your answer is better.
[06:11:46] <ph88> seutje: i have now   formatNoMatches: function(term) { return 'No results found'; }   but the select2 spinner keeps spinning and i don't see that message
[06:11:59] <dfos> I cannot append options to select after banging my head on the wall. Could I get any help? http://bpaste.net/show/3YDbqzM0Z7dSUEoimUp0/
[06:12:16] <seutje> ph88: I think it expects your server to always respond as if it had results, just hand back 0 results
[06:12:33] <ph88> seutje: ok i send back error code 404 now ... i will try 200 with []
[06:12:34] <seutje> gvo: u can? how? the docs don't mention this
[06:13:07] <shoky> dfos: the semi-colon in line 5 shouldn't be there
[06:13:11] <Cork> dfos: what is alert($('[id="revenue_head"]').length) ?
[06:13:16] <gvo> gvo: I'm looking at http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16863168/select2-query-search-throwing-syntax-error and it appears he's doing it.
[06:13:23] <Cork> ah
[06:13:36] <Cork> shoky: good detection
[06:13:42] <gvo> seutje: Sorry ^^^^
[06:14:51] <shoky> Cork: thx ;p
[06:14:55] <gvo> seutje: Not suggesting that was his problem directory but it appears that person is doing an ajax call with a select2 plugin.
[06:15:04] <ph88> seutje:  "[]" 200 gives  JS error "g.results" not defined  "" 200 gives no error   ... in both cases spinner keeps going and no message
[06:15:05] <gvo> directly
[06:15:43] <seutje> gvo: weird, docs suggest the callback for the query option has to return an object o.O
[06:16:00] <seutje> http://ivaynberg.github.io/select2/#doc-query
[06:16:05] <geekboy88> Guys, I have four elements `div.some1`, `div.some2`, `div.some2` and `div.some3`. How to "$.unique" them into three elements (`div.some1`, `div.some2` and `div.some3`) by their selectors?
[06:16:22] <dfos> shoky: saved the day, thanks!
[06:16:33] <ph88> what should the server return to give select2 "no search results" ?
[06:16:35] <seutje> ph88: you'll need to form it in the same way as if it had results, but just don't add any
[06:16:39] <Cork> geekboy88: give them a common class and select on that
[06:16:44] <gvo> seutje: someone seems to have broken the code :)
[06:16:45] <Cork> geekboy88: or you would have to select on all of them
[06:17:12] <Cork> geekboy88: ah, sorry missed that
[06:17:14] <dfos> but the nooby me still can't get the wisdom behind it. would you care to explain?
[06:17:16] <geekboy88> Cork: Yeah, select all of them through comma
[06:17:30] <Cork> geekboy88: you would get 4 hits if you have 4 elements
[06:17:43] <Cork> geekboy88: uniq is based on that you can compare dom elements
[06:18:30] <ph88> seutje: got it to work, THX !
[06:18:35] <geekboy88> Cork: Yeah, I know )
[06:18:38] <seutje> cool
[06:19:12] <Cork> geekboy88: so the only way to do that form of filtering would be to string compare the class names and filter() on that
[06:19:19] <ph88> seutje: do you know ... i have  quietMillis: 600,  but still the ajax trigger really quickly
[06:19:44] <ph88> seutje: i had a word with 4 letters and i press backspace and it does 5 ajax requests ...
[06:19:48] <geekboy88> Cork: I need to compare a full selector `input#some.some1` that only can be :)
[06:20:04] <shoky> dfos: semi-colons should come at the end of statements, your line 5 was in the middle of the statement that started on line 4 and ends on line 6
[06:20:19] <Cork> geekboy88: so $('#some') then
[06:20:21] <seutje> ph88: yeah, no clue, not familiar with the plugin's internals
[06:20:30] <ph88> oki
[06:20:34] <Cork> geekboy88: id's is always unique
[06:20:45] <Cork> s/is/are/
[06:22:03] <geekboy88> Cork: I know. But may be you saw a function, that make unique all elements by tag, id, class name, name, other attributes
[06:22:18] <Cork> geekboy88: there isn't one
[06:22:30] <Cork> geekboy88: you would have to build one based on .filter() for example
[06:22:31] <seutje> ph88: looks like it's implementing some sort of debounce though: https://github.com/ivaynberg/select2/blob/master/select2.js#L221
[06:22:39] <shoky> be the function
[06:23:01] <dfos> thanks again shoky
[06:23:23] <geekboy88> Cork: Or $.grep, yeah? )
[06:23:40] <Cork> geekboy88: grep is for arrays .filter is for jquery objects
[06:23:53] <Cork> (well grep is for arrays and objects)
[06:24:07] <ph88> seutje: yes i understood that from this issue https://github.com/ivaynberg/select2/issues/740
[06:24:08] <b-ot> ph88: Issue #740 by fckas (7mon 1w ago): quietMillis does not delay ajax search
[06:24:44] <ph88> it does abort the request though ...
[06:24:45] <geekboy88> Cork: Thank you for the reply!
[06:24:52] <ph88> not sure if that is the way the debouce is suppoe to work
[06:25:25] <Cork> geekboy88: var classes = ''; $().filter(function() { var test = $(this).hasClass(classes); if(!test) { classes += '' + this.class; } return test; })
[06:25:31] <seutje> debouncing has nothing to do with aborting the ajax call
[06:25:51] <Cork> geekboy88: opps should be a space in the '' there...
[06:25:51] <seutje> the quietMillis has nothing to do with that
[06:28:13] <geekboy88> Cork: I was searching a multipurpose solution :) Tag, class, id, attributes... But thank you!
[06:28:45] <Cork> geekboy88: well then add those to the test loop
[06:28:58] <Cork> geekboy88: that would give you a class test fairly cheaply
[06:28:58] <chachan> seutje, solved. I was wrapping the input with a div and a span like the radio, I could've copied and pasted it =/
[06:29:03] <chachan> thanks!
[06:30:15] <geekboy88> Cork: Maybe I can get the jquery objects names
[06:30:35] <geekboy88> Cork: from array like `[div#some, div#some2]`
[06:30:35] <Cork> geekboy88: jquery objects don't have a name
[06:31:02] <Cork> geekboy88: the closest you could get would be this.toString()
[06:31:25] <Cork> (this is a dom element btw)
[06:31:40] <seutje> this is magic, everyone knows that!
[06:33:29] <geekboy88> Cork: But how can I get this names into strings [div#some1, div#some1, div#some1, div#some2.modal hide fade] ?
[06:33:39] <Cork> geekboy88: what names?
[06:33:54] <Cork> there is nodeName if that is what you mean
[06:34:02] <Cork> then there is the .id and .class
[06:35:44] <geekboy88> Cork: Yeah, and how to get the `div#some2.modal hide fade` with less code? :)
[06:36:13] <Cork> the what?
[06:36:37] <geekboy88> Cork: string div#some2.modal hide fade of element
[06:36:45] <dfos> is this a good way to make an option selected? http://bpaste.net/show/6dxdMH90Im150TRsvZGW/
[06:36:48] <mls_> hi all
[06:36:56] <Cork> geekboy88: if you want to create an array of those strings you would have to build them your self
[06:36:58] <dfos> What are the good practices?
[06:37:26] <Cork> geekboy88: $.map($(jquery object), function() { return 'string to return'; })
[06:37:52] <mls_> how to capture a selected option if option value="" ? jQ("#mySelect option:selected") returns nothing when option value=""
[06:38:18] <Cork> and something like this.nodeName + '#' + this.id + '.' + this.class.split(' ').join('.')
[06:38:30] <Cork> geekboy88: would give you the "name" you talk about
[06:39:32] <geekboy88> Cork: And then I should to "unique" by their "full names", right?
[06:39:59] <Cork> geekboy88: not sure what you would do with that string
[06:40:12] <Cork> but i guess $.inArray() could help you
[06:42:39] <Cork> geekboy88: so: var fprints = []; $().filter(function() { var fprint = this.nodeName + '#' + this.id + '.' + this.class.split(' ').join('.'), test = $.inArray(fprints, fprint); if(test == -1) { fprints.push(fprint); } return test == -1; })
[06:42:52] <geekboy88> Cork: The $.unique function keep all dom elements, even with the same selectors. I want to keep only one dom element with such selector. And that's why I need to filter them by nodeName, id, class :)
[06:43:04] <Cork> geekboy88: unique only works for dom elements
[06:43:13] <Cork> like the api page clearly states
[06:55:30] <seutje> OT: anyone know of a tool to determine how much lighter a certain color is?
[06:56:58] <Cork> hue?
[06:57:42] <Cork> seutje: http://snook.ca/technical/colour_contrast/colour.html
[06:58:50] <seutje> Cork: sweet, now to figure out how to make it update :x
[06:59:02] <Cork> it doesn't update for you?
[06:59:27] <Cork> just move focus and it should update
[06:59:31] <seutje> I'm an idiot
[06:59:50] <seutje> was entering with # in front and not even noticing it cut off the last char -_-
[06:59:58] <seutje> oh monday, you foul beast
[07:00:11] <Cork> :)
[07:20:59] <mls_> could someone tell me why my select rule isn't working ? http://jsfiddle.net/5WZWz/ Thanks
[07:21:25] <mls_> (I'm returning false and validate still doesn't care)
[07:32:22] <shoky> mls_: it's working
[07:32:56] <mls_> shoky not to me, I never have the error message
[07:34:06] <shoky> mls_: false means it's not required. also the alert is interfering i think.. change to true and remove the alert
[07:35:20] <mls_> shoky : done, still not working : http://jsfiddle.net/5WZWz/2/
[07:35:46] <d0den> My site has a series of sliders that the user can adjust. I'd like for the slider position to be persistent between visits for returning users. What's the easiest way to do that? Setting a cookie? Localstorage? I've never done anything like this before
[07:35:48] <shoky> mls_: you need to submit the form. press enter in the text input
[07:36:09] <Cork> shoky, mls_: [16:35:38.740] ReferenceError: jQ is not defined  might be why it isn't visible on the page
[07:36:13] <mls_> shoky: I do, and nothing happens
[07:36:22] <seutje> what's the difference between jQuery and jQ? o.O
[07:36:37] <seutje> oh, prolly just a typo :x
[07:36:42] <Cork> seutje: window.jQ = $.noConflict()
[07:36:42] <shoky> mls_: er sorry forgot to say to put an empty value on the first <option>    e.g <option value>null</option>
[07:36:48] <Cork> is my guess
[07:36:54] <shoky> Cork: that line doesn't do anything even if you correct it
[07:37:19] <mls_> JQ is a bad copy paste, jQuery is correct
[07:37:21] <Cork> shoky: well /1 shows the error message for me
[07:37:28] <seutje> fuck it, monday won this round
[07:37:36] <Cork> and changing to return true doens't change anything
[07:37:44] <mls_> cork : right, i'm using var jQ=jQuery.noConflict();
[07:38:02] <shoky> Cork: it shows the error when?
[07:38:19] <Cork> shoky: on page load in / and /2
[07:38:33] <Cork> shoky: ah, sorry
[07:38:40] <Cork> shoky: though you meant something else
[07:38:48] <Cork> shoky: go to the input and hit enter
[07:38:54] <Cork> shoky: or change the value in the dropdown
[07:38:57] <shoky> yeah that's what i told him to do
[07:39:35] <mls_> shoky : working thanks. but behavior is not as expected. I though validate would go as soon as select would change, but I have to submit the form (when input text are validated on loose focus)
[07:39:41] <Cork> but unless i read the code completely wrong
[07:39:53] <Cork> he wants to show it when the dropdown in null
[07:41:06] <mls_> Cork : any way to get the validate select to check on loose focus (like input fields) and not on submit ?
[07:41:34] <Cork> mls_: i rarely use the validation plugin, so i'm the wrong person to ask
[07:42:58] <mls_> Cork : ok thanks anyway
[07:46:23] <shoky> mls_: http://jsfiddle.net/5WZWz/3/
[07:47:20] <d0den> I want to use jQuery localstorage to set a slider to its last value when a user returns to the site, does anyone have a link to some example code?
[07:47:22] <mls_> shoky : onfocusout isn't the default behavior ?
[07:49:03] <shoky> mls_: nope.. submit is always the default for form stuff
[07:49:53] <mls_> shoky because when you delete some text in an input field and loose focus, it will fire the error if text is required
[07:51:00] <shoky> mls_: ah
[07:51:44] <mls_> shoky : another question : some of our fields are prefilled, and we're using icons next to the fields to show current field status (neutral > not yet filled, error or valid). We would like to check as valid prefilled fields, but not mark as error the others fields not filled... don't know if I'm clear
[07:52:58] <shoky> mls_: not too clear to me, also i don't really use the validation lib so i wouldn't know prolly
[07:52:59] <gvo> mls_ so if all the fields are not filled, don't indicate any fields that might be in error?
[07:53:35] <gvo> mls_: Until all fields are filled, dont' mark any as error?
[07:53:59] <mls_> shoky, gvo : so when user loads the form page, the form is prefilled with user's info (not all fields). Those fields which are prefilled will be marked as "valid", others fields (empty) should not be validated (as they would be showed as error, but user didn't have the change to fill them yet).
[07:54:12] <mls_> shoky thanks btw for the info
[07:55:09] <mls_> gvo : but once fields are focusout or form submitted, all fields should be then validated
[07:57:36] <gvo> Might have to write your own validation scheme.  I don't know if the JQ one will do that.
[07:57:51] <gvo> Or extend it.
[07:59:06] <gvo> mls_: http://www.codeproject.com/Tips/563781/Extending-the-jQuery-validation-plug-in has some info on extending.
[08:01:47] <d0den> If I'm calling an item from localStorage, do I have to check if it exists? What happens if I try to set a value equal to a localStorage item that doesn't exist?
[08:01:50] <mls_> gvo thanks for the info, I might get a work around by loading another validate definition at loading
[08:02:07] <mls_> gvo which would only check for prefilled fields
[08:04:02] <gvo> mls_ go for it. ;)

[08:17:25] <gvo> But disappeared right after that.
[08:17:28] <mls_> :p
[08:17:52] <gvo> Unless he's hiding somehow.  He's not in the user list.
[08:18:03] <gvo> I don't know if it's possible to hide.

[08:29:30] <d0den> If I set a var equal to a localStorage.getitem for an item that doesn't exist, how can I check whether or not the  var has a value?
[08:29:43] <d0den> or rather, a localStorage item that may or may not exist
[08:30:04] <d0den> I tried using typeof != undefined but that doesn't seem to work
[08:30:20] <mls_> d0den: like test value of "var foo;" ?
[08:31:12] <d0den> mls_ I'm not sure what value I'm looking for - the localStorage item could have a value of 0, in which case I'd want to use it, but if it doesn't exist, I don't want it to be set to 0
[08:32:00] <d0den> As in, it could have been set to 0 by user input, in which case I want it, but at present when the item doesn't exist it gets set to 0, which I don't want
[08:32:00] <mls_> d0den: why don't you return "null" or something when localStorage doesn't have an item ?
[08:32:27] <d0den> mls_, how would I do that when I get the item?
[08:32:52] <mls_> d0den: could you put an example of your code on jsfiddle ?
[08:33:00] <mls_> !jsfiddle
[08:33:07] <mls_> lazy bot...
[08:34:20] <d0den> yep, one sec

[09:07:29] <geekboy88> doug65536: What's the different order you mean?
[09:08:36] <doug65536> geekboy88: I mean, if things have the same classes, just in a different order, your code will see them as different without the sort, right?
[09:10:35] <geekboy88> doug65536: The code gets elements from the start of a document
[09:10:48] <geekboy88> doug65536: Or I'm wrong?
[09:10:51] <Krambiorix> mls_ a bit late, but thanks!!
[09:11:07] <doug65536> geekboy88: it gets whatever the incoming selector is
[09:11:19] <doug65536> geekboy88: in this case, $('.foo')
[09:12:28] <geekboy88> doug65536: Yeah, but it gets it from the start of a document? Isn't so?
[09:12:36] <doug65536> geekboy88: no
[09:13:20] <doug65536> geekboy88: return this.filter(function(index){ ...    <-- processes whatever is the current selector. in this cast, that's $('.foo'), so it's each thing with class foo
[09:13:29] <doug65536> in this case*
[09:14:05] <doug65536> geekboy88: "from the start of the document". it's confusing to think of it that way though
[09:14:28] <doug65536> geekboy88: "everything with class foo" is a more no-nonsense way to see it
[09:16:27] <doug65536> geekboy88: this test actually tests it http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/cStWG/3/
[09:17:14] <doug65536> geekboy88: now I added an element with the class names reversed http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/cStWG/4/
[09:17:42] <doug65536> geekboy88: and this shows that it doesn't work correctly without the sort http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/cStWG/5/
[09:18:12] <fission6> how do i go up one from an element to its sister
[09:18:28] <doug65536> fission6: next sibling?
[09:18:36] <fission6> <t1>..</t1><t2></t2>, i have t2 selected, i want t1
[09:18:50] <doug65536> fission6: .prev()
[09:18:54] <fission6> thanks
[09:19:15] <doug65536> fission6: depends on where you start from I think
[09:19:23] <geekboy88> doug65536: Oh!! I've understood you!!
[09:19:24] <fission6> pref works thanks
[09:19:25] <fission6> prev
[09:19:42] <doug65536> geekboy88: :)
[09:22:20] <intellix> I should be able to access Sizzle within my page that uses jQuery right? Sizzle doesn't seem to be defined
[09:23:24] <duch_kazatel> intellix what are you trying to accomplish?  are you just tyring to select something using sizzle?
[09:23:40] <intellix> I wanted to check this out: Sizzle.selectors.cacheLength
[09:25:20] <duch_kazatel> aaaaah.  hrm.  blog says it's valid here:
[09:25:22] <duch_kazatel> http://blog.jquery.com/2012/07/04/the-new-sizzle/
[09:25:54] <intellix> I'm thinking it's not accessible if it's pulled in with jQuery, only if it's used on it's own?
[09:26:36] <intellix> I'm seeing references to Sizzle functionality directly within jQuery like: jQuery.find, jQuery.expr
[09:27:01] <abraxsi> intellix, isn't sizzle only used for backwards compatibility?
[09:27:09] <intellix> shah, and there it is: $.expr.cacheLength
[09:27:37] <intellix> I thought Sizzle was the core of all DOM Querying within jQuery
[09:28:04] <abraxsi> to my understanding, only when document.querySelector isn't implemented
[09:28:17] <abraxsi> worth checking
[09:28:50] <intellix> ok, you're right. querySelectorAll is used for everything unless theres no compatibility then it uses Sizzle
[09:29:06] <intellix> because I was arguing with someone, saying that they needed to cache $('.somethng')
[09:29:13] <geekboy88> doug65536: Thank you!! As you said .sort() solved the problem :)
[09:29:33] <intellix> then I read that Sizzle caches them.....
[09:30:29] <intellix> is there any performance comparison available that shows the difference between: var things = $('.things'); things.each() rather than $('.things').each()
[09:31:39] <abraxsi> intellix, you could do what I rarely tend to do, and make one yourself :-)
[09:31:55] <dcherman> intellix: jquery always uses Sizzle.  qSA has various bugs in different browsers, and has a horrible spec bug with element rooted queries.  sizzle fixes all of that.
[09:32:04] <intellix> checking this out: http://jsperf.com/sizzle-selector-caching
[09:34:09] <doug65536> intellix: make one on http://jsperf.com
[09:35:47] <doug65536> intellix: there won't be any difference
[09:36:33] <doug65536> intellix: if you use $('.things)... more than once then 1st one will be much faster
[09:36:57] <intellix> there won't be any difference between var things = $('.things'); things.each() vs $('.things').each() every 5 seconds?
[09:37:23] <doug65536> intellix: about as close to 0 difference as you'll ever get
[09:37:40] <intellix> so there is some sort of selector/compile cache going on
[09:38:11] <doug65536> intellix: $ is a function
[09:38:27] <doug65536> intellix: it evaluates the selector and builds an internal collection of elements
[09:38:43] <doug65536> intellix: then it returns this
[09:39:03] <doug65536> intellix: when you .anything() it, it is that object's 'this'
[09:40:20] <doug65536> intellix: it doesn't magically reevaluate it, ever
[09:40:23] <Krambiorix> i have a draggable div and when i hover just between 2 droppable divs, both droppable divs are hovered.... The draggable div is already out of the upper droppable div.... How can i make it to hover only one droppable?
[09:40:33] <doug65536> you have to run it again to get a different selection of elements
[09:40:42] <doug65536> intellix: you might call that "caching" yes
[09:41:31] <jop008> ncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected end of input at line 1 how to find out where } went wrong?
[09:41:42] <jop008> Crhome console messag
[09:42:30] <jop008> found
[09:43:04] <doug65536> jop008: one way is to paste it in jsfiddle.net and click tidy up, and jshint
[09:43:10] <intellix> mmm jsperf just sends me to a blank page -.-
[09:44:00] <doug65536> intellix: do you think it will magically be a different set of elements?
[09:44:15] <doug65536> intellix: when it runs it builds a new object and returns it.
[09:44:26] <doug65536> intellix: that collection of elements won't change
[09:44:29] <intellix> no, I was told that when you call $('.something'), then it goes through the entire DOM looking for class="something"
[09:44:41] <intellix> but if you var something = $('.something'); then it only does it once when used multiple times
[09:44:54] <doug65536> intellix: no... you misunderstand slightly
[09:45:19] <doug65536> intellix: if you do var something = $('.something');   ONCE, then from then on use something, then yes that is faster
[09:45:30] <intellix> this is exactly what I mean: http://pastebin.com/jRZTWzZy
[09:45:59] <doug65536> intellix: but if you do var something = $('.something'); something.hide();    EVERY time, then it is no better than $('.something').hide()  every time
[09:46:37] <doug65536> intellix: yes! definitely avoid repeating the selector
[09:46:46] <doug65536> yes 2nd part is much slower
[09:47:05] <intellix> I just created a test case on jsperf.com http://jsperf.com/jquery-class-selector-caching
[09:47:45] <intellix> 1% :P
[09:47:56] <doug65536> because your selector is so simple
[09:48:45] <doug65536> look how dog slow it is...
[09:48:51] <doug65536> not even 50 operations per second?
[09:49:11] <Xander1> is there a way to reset jquery ui sliders?
[09:49:14] <intellix> a lot of <a> elements, i'll try something a little more complex
[09:49:17] <doug65536> console.log spam is screwing up your performance measurement
[09:49:40] <doug65536> intellix: close your debugger when running perf test too
[09:49:43] <Xander1> in our app - after user submits a form - trying to reset the form - but positioning of the slider stays the same
[09:50:27] <intellix> I don't have the debugger up
[09:51:50] <doug65536> intellix: all your reading href is diluting the perf measurement too
[09:52:16] <intellix> ok, so I'll just log the <a>
[09:52:55] <doug65536> intellix: don't log anything!
[09:53:06] <intellix> what should I do then? :P just nothing inside the loop?
[09:53:08] <doug65536> intellix: console.log is *incredibly* slow
[09:53:34] <doug65536> intellix: trust me, javascript optimizations are nearly nonexistent. it will call your each every time
[09:53:45] <doug65536> http://jsperf.com/jquery-class-selector-caching/2
[09:53:56] <doug65536> 33% slower if you don't spam console.log
[09:54:13] <intellix> I removed all console.log and we're still talking about 1% difference
[09:54:25] <doug65536> 33% slower for me with my test case
[09:54:51] <intellix> oh right, yep
[09:55:04] <intellix> 80% slower with nothing inside
[09:55:12] <intellix> 4,000 to 870
[09:55:28] <doug65536> yeah, .attr is pretty expensive
[09:55:37] <doug65536> chrome has awful string processing performance
[09:56:48] <intellix> I guess I have to see what it's like in the older browsers as it'll hurt more there. To prove that it's worth "caching" the items :P
[09:57:01] <doug65536> intellix: there's no doubt it is worth it
[09:57:22] <doug65536> intellix: it is a classic "use a bit more memory" vs "do it over and over" tradeoff
[09:58:34] <doug65536> intellix: in this instance, the "bit more memory" has a short lifetime anyway, so it would be foolish *not* to do it
[09:58:38] <intellix> well I expected this. But read something about Sizzle having some sort of cache, but I guess that's just on the actual selector compiling. so it compiles $(".mt2") and holds it there
[09:59:08] <doug65536> intellix: "compiles" is drastically overstating it. it makes an array of elements. no magic
[10:00:58] <doug65536> intellix: there are some caches in jquery. it caches data attribute lookups for example
[10:02:33] <doug65536> intellix: it can't cache. you could change the page at any moment and would expect $('.mt2') to pick up the new elements
[10:04:33] <doug65536> intellix: on the other hand, if you did var m = $('.mt2'); $('body').empty();   then m would be a collection of elements, and everything would be removed from the body, but m would still have those elements and they would still be alive, because 'm' is keeping them alive
[10:05:07] <intellix> ah, so these are the dreaded memory leak issues that people talk about
[10:05:07] <doug65536> intellix: they would be gone for any purpose other than looking in m though
[10:05:27] <pl2> What is concidered the best tabbing plugin out there at the moment? not jquery ui
[10:05:28] <doug65536> intellix: no, it's not a leak. js is garbage collected. you are holding a reference to them, so they stay alive
[10:05:47] <doug65536> intellix: nothing will ever disappear unexpectedly in js.
[10:05:56] <EdwardIII> except clothes
[10:06:21] <Xander1> anyone familiar how to reset jquery ui slider, i.e. for when resetting form?
[10:06:41] <doug65536> intellix: the memory leaks you are referring to are bad js engines that can't handle circular references
[10:07:03] <intellix> Xander1: I'm not 100% certain, but can you $('thing').slider('create') or: $('thing').slider('destroy'); $('thing').slider()?
[10:07:40] <doug65536> intellix: if A creates a new B and a new C, and B has a reference to C and C has a reference to B, then A removes its reference to B, then a bad js engine won't see that B and C are keeping eachother alive
[10:07:44] <Xander1> @intellix hmmm ok, i'll look into that
[10:08:11] <Xander1> what im using is a jquery ui datetimepicker - and trying to reset the slider for timepicker when form successfully submits
[10:09:46] <intellix> I see theres a method: refresh
[10:09:57] <doug65536> intellix: in garbage collector terminology, B and C would be "unreachable" so they should be garbage collected
[10:10:03] <intellix> so you could try that? $('thing').slider('refresh');
[10:10:17] <intellix> so theres not so much to worry about with memory leakage? :D
[10:10:25] <doug65536> intellix: not really
[10:10:58] <intellix> Xander1: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/ui/jquery.ui.slider.js#L65
[10:11:01] <doug65536> intellix: you could have an array that unnecessarily keeps things alive, but I wouldn't call that a leak, I'd call it "by design"
[10:13:24] <intellix> cheers, gotta run :D will jump back in
[10:22:11] <Xander1> @intellix :) thank you :)
[10:32:13] <dannii> Anyone here knows what the following Jquery script is called? = Sidebar that always stay on the right/left even if you scroll the main content
[10:32:52] <Xander1> @dannii i think you can get that effect with CSS - position fixed
[11:11:53] <javalover> ok i have an actual question for once :-)
[11:12:09] <javalover> I have a php loader that retrieves more posts, everything is working fine & amazing but i have 1 issue
[11:12:29] <javalover> when my content loads, it jumps the scrollbar, different amounts depending on what type of pictures are loaded
[11:12:46] <javalover> is there anyway to keep this under control, when it jumps back like 12 feet high it's kinda weird looking
[11:14:10] <javalover> now that i've gone to facebook to check with what they do, it's not the scrollbar that i'm having trouble with, it's the actual page jumping when the scrollbar jumps
[11:14:33] <javalover> is there anyway to make it so the scrollbar jumps, but the page stays where it was scrolled to?
[11:16:13] <javalover> my loader: $.get('appendnewhtml.php',{"id" : currentid },function(data){   $("#panel:last-child").append(data); } );
[11:28:43] <javalover> um solved somehow
[11:28:56] <javalover> http://forum.jquery.com/topic/making-ajax-content-load-and-scroll-into-view
[11:48:38] <ppppp> hey
[11:49:13] <ppppp> for making a modal that appeared after x seconds after load, does anyone have advice for a starting point?
[11:57:40] <JFranks> Sorry to be a pest.. this is something I need to make note of and save/bookmark.. http://api.jquery.com/checked-selector/ tells us how to count the # of checked elements, and it tells us how to get the 'checked' option in a form with a radio-set.. But it does not have an example of how to verify a single radio's state?
[12:05:03] <JFranks> Here.. I need to make this a toggle.. there's a comment in the JS : http://jsfiddle.net/EE3vB/1/
[12:05:49] <abraxsi> JFranks, then you're probably looking for a checkbox rather than a radio button
[12:06:41] <czytacz> hi, is there a way to load txt file contents straight to a variable?
[12:06:44] <JFranks> Oh
[12:07:58] <abraxsi> czytacz.. if your web server can deliver it, then your $.ajax() success(data) function should be receiving it as a string.
[12:08:28] <czytacz> abraxsi
[12:09:01] <czytacz> abraxsi, nah, I have to use html+js only. no server-side actions
[12:09:11] <benedikt> I'm using jquery to POST data. The server then response with json-encoded data. I have successfully been doing $.post("/Url/", {key: value}, function (data) { console.log(data.key) });. Is this the right way to handle JSON in $.post()?
[12:10:07] <abraxsi> yeh but.. actually the more fancy the server, the less likely it will just deliver text :-) just try using the $.ajax function and I think you'll get what you want
[12:10:30] <Andrevan> $.ajax is just $.post with more options
[12:10:36] <Andrevan> or rather the latter is shorthand for the former
[12:11:06] <benedikt> Andrevan: Andrevan: are you reponding to me..?
[12:11:10] <benedikt> abraxsi*
[12:11:17] <abraxsi> every time i use post, get, load etc i always end up replacing it later with $.ajax, so i just use that form by default now :-)
[12:11:22] <abraxsi> I wasn't
[12:11:58] <Andrevan> I was responding to abraxsi, benedikt, your question is funny because you don't seem to be having a problem
[12:12:08] <Andrevan> are you looking for help or an opinion on design?
[12:12:21] <benedikt> Andrevan: i dont have a problem *now*, my question is about avoid problems in the *future* :)
[12:12:29] <Andrevan> benedikt: yagni
[12:12:32] <benedikt> Andrevan: opinion on design
[12:12:43] <Andrevan> benedikt: this is fine for now, refactor later
[12:12:45] <abraxsi> agreed, it looks fine benedikt
[12:12:52] <benedikt> does it work in all browsers?
[12:13:00] <Andrevan> benedikt: as in, IE 6?
[12:13:07] <benedikt> and why the heck is there $.get() and $.getJSON() then?
[12:13:10] <benedikt> Andrevan: no, fuck that
[12:13:16] <Andrevan> get and post are different benedikt
[12:13:24] <Andrevan> those are HTTP methods
[12:13:31] <benedikt> Andrevan: i know
[12:13:37] <benedikt> i'm new to jquery, not http :)
[12:13:43] <Andrevan> OK - what is the question though?
[12:13:59] <Andrevan> $.get and $.post are shorthands to $.ajax
[12:14:09] <Andrevan> $.getJSON and $.get return slightly different objects
[12:14:22] <benedikt> why isn't there a $.postJSON ?
[12:14:28] <Andrevan> why should there be?
[12:14:31] <Andrevan> the thing you post is an arg
[12:14:33] <benedikt> for when the server returns JSON
[12:14:46] <benedikt> Andrevan: yes, but the response could be json, xml or plaintext or even html
[12:14:58] <Andrevan> no the response is always in the same format, a jquery data object
[12:15:13] <Andrevan> the question is what you're wrapping there
[12:15:23] <Andrevan> $.getJSON just wraps a native JSON object
[12:15:27] <Andrevan> instead of a string
[12:15:32] <Andrevan> it's just for convenience
[12:15:55] <Andrevan> what you have is fine - if you want to post a string instead of a native JSON object, you can do that
[12:15:58] <benedikt> so is $.getJSON for _sending_ a JSON encoded paramter, but the reponse is treated the same way in $.get and $.getJSON?
[12:16:14] <Andrevan> no...
[12:16:42] <Andrevan> what is sent is always a URLencoded string I believe
[12:16:44] <JFranks> Aha! document.getElementById('import_only').checked  !
[12:16:54] <JFranks> Thanks #jQuery
[12:17:00] <Andrevan> the idea is
[12:17:11] <Andrevan> $.getJSON == $.get + a $.parseJSON
[12:17:17] <Andrevan> it's purely a convenience
[12:17:46] <Andrevan> it repackages the response up though
[12:17:54] <benedikt> Andrevan: right, thats what i thought. But if i do $.post to a server (HTTP POST) and get a json encoded string back, do i have to use $.parseJSON manually?
[12:18:08] <Andrevan> benedikt: yeah
[12:18:30] <Andrevan> wait no
[12:18:33] <abraxsi> lol
[12:18:35] <Andrevan> you can specify a type parameter
[12:18:42] <abraxsi> benedikt. you're creating a problem in your mind
[12:18:44] <abraxsi> !
[12:18:58] <benedikt> abraxsi: thats what i think
[12:19:02] <abraxsi> hehe
[12:19:02] <Andrevan> the fourth parameter can be a type, according to google benedikt
[12:19:10] <Andrevan> so set that to 'json'
[12:19:39] <abraxsi> benedikt, $.ajax is the 'do everything' starting point to understand
[12:19:43] <benedikt> fourth parameter??? mind==blown
[12:19:47] <Andrevan> $.post(url, json, function() {}, 'json')
[12:20:02] <abraxsi> after that, there are lots of methods that do more specific things, but basically just assume things about the ajax setup
[12:20:12] <benedikt> abraxsi: yeah, they are wrappers for $.ajax
[12:20:37] <Andrevan> http://www.abeautifulsite.net/blog/2008/05/postjson-for-jquery/
[12:20:41] <Andrevan> very old
[12:20:42] <Andrevan> ymmv
[12:20:55] <abraxsi> if you're confused, I recommend just using ajax, until you fully understand.. then one day you'll use $.post.. and then the next day you'll change it back because it's missing a config option lol
[12:22:12] <abraxsi> if you use $.ajax()
[12:22:27] <abraxsi> the args that matter most are url, data, type, success and error
[12:23:15] <abraxsi> look them up in the api and you'll be fine. you'll see the success method doesn't care what the data it gets back from the server is. it might get back an html string, or a javascript object if it detected a json response
[12:29:16] <JFranks> So I have an input : id="import_only" type="checkbox" checked="checked"  .. so when the page loads it's "checked" by default.. Course when I try to check that state with  document.getElementById('import_only').checked  .. I get "false" until I manually toggle it? .. What was the trick?
[12:31:27] <JFranks> Hmm.. can't reproduce in a fiddle.. Grrreat.. :)
[12:33:56] <Tingle> Is there a reason why css and js files are loaded, or randomly decided if they are loaded on page reload even tho they are not modified, because the requests reutnr Not Modified (304)?
[12:34:53] <Andrevan> Tingle: caching
[12:35:06] <JFranks> Tingle: Sounds like a server question. ;)
[12:35:18] <Tingle> yes caching, but how do I set it to cache properly :P?
[12:35:36] <abraxsi> Tingle, all browser's decide randomly whether they'll bother checking the new version :-p
[12:36:03] <JFranks> Depends on the server type.. In apache I use 'mod_expires' settings in .htaccess
[12:36:08] <abraxsi> however with reference to jQuery you are probably talking about development right?
[12:36:14] <Andrevan> Tingle: needs more info on your environment
[12:36:46] <Tingle> I think its apache, but also jQuery sometimes gets requested with a 304 return
[12:36:54] <abraxsi> if you're using Chrome Inspector, click settings. I think it's the first option to tell it not to cache stuff when dev tools are open - makes it easy during development
[12:37:11] <Tingle> loading from //ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.10.2/jquery.min.js
[12:37:23] <abraxsi> well why wouldn't you want it to be cached?
[12:38:00] <JFranks> Yeah a 304 response would be exactly right
[12:38:09] <JFranks> It hasn't been modified. :p
[12:40:17] <Tingle> yes, but why does the browser do a request in the first place
[12:40:24] <Tingle> that just takes up load time
[12:40:43] <abraxsi> Would anyone mind taking a look at the plugin i published today? looking for feedback... http://lukesargeant.com/jquery/listplus/demo.html
[12:41:27] <Xander1> anyone familiar with this plugin: http://trentrichardson.com/examples/timepicker/ - i need to reset time sliders when timepicker shows up again
[12:42:54] <JFranks> Tingle: Technically the headers are supposed to contain some 'exipry' info the browser uses to determine if the cached copy is still valid.. If the browser never got info, lost that info, or is in a developer mode like the abraxsi mentioned.. then it'd ask for it and get a 304?
[12:43:10] <JFranks> expiry ?
[12:43:34] <Tingle> whats this expirey info
[12:45:24] <abraxsi> Web servers can deliver files to a browser and tell it how long the file is valid for, or when it expires and should ask again for a fresh copy of the file
[12:46:06] <abraxsi> most of the time, you don't need to worry about it until you know about it already... if that makes sense
[12:46:22] <Tingle> yea sorta
[12:46:26] <Tingle> ok thanks for the info
[13:30:56] <javalover> this is so wierd
[13:31:05] <javalover> i have append code that jumps the page for some reason
[13:31:12] <javalover> sometimes it doesn't sometimes it does...
[13:40:14] <FireSlash> Is it possible to select the element created by css's :after?
[13:40:46] <FireSlash> doing $('#ele:after') seems to give me a big fat null
[13:46:19] <javalover> so apparently, if i just reset the scrolltop to what it was before the append, it works...
[13:46:56] <javalover> anyways
[13:48:58] <chhristian> Hello. I want to know if there is some way to make a "bind" on an eval. Something like this →    eval( '$( :one ).html();' ).bind( 'one',   my_object );          What would be the nearest way to do that ? thanks.
[13:49:02] <Xander1> anyone familiar with this plugin: http://trentrichardson.com/examples/timepicker/ - i need to reset time sliders when timepicker shows up again - input fields clear up, but the sliders stay at the same position
[13:57:28] <grafi> have some example code of your problem on jsfiddle.net Xander1 ?
[13:58:26] <Xander1> @grafi, let me see if i can set it up
[13:58:45] <JFranks> Hmmm I need a good addon for re-captcha to stump bots and e-turk solvers.. something I can add to a form that will seem valid even if done wrong and just make a subtle change to the result so only a human would notice they didn't succeed?
[13:59:22] <JFranks> I'm guessing if I don't make something custom then it'll become useless as it becomes popular.. so wondering if anyone has seen anything I could take and 'tweak' ?
[13:59:40] <JFranks> (preferably within the scope of current jQuery)
[13:59:51] <grafi> JFranks ive heard good things about hidden text inputs, for smaller sites anyways
[14:00:35] <JFranks> Pretty sure we have a hidden input.. The bots seem to ignore anything that's "display:none" ?
[14:00:47] <grafi> that would be instead of a captcha of course
[14:01:35] <grafi> so you already have bots
[14:01:46] <grafi> then its probably better to do something different ^^
[14:02:20] <SiM0nA> uhhhh, anyone willing to help me with little problem about jquery.fancybox-1.3.4.pack.js ?:)))
[14:03:00] <grafi> just ask SiM0nA
[14:03:31] <JFranks> Yep.. Was thinking of something like "drag these images to where they belong" .. with something mixed in that would slow down or even halt ESL users.
[14:03:41] <ppppp> not particularly jquery, but I'm reading some XML. Anyone have recommendations for an XML viewer. On MacOS or browser addon?
[14:04:26] <javalover> ok legit question
[14:04:35] <javalover> i'm apending new html to an existing object
[14:04:48] <javalover> is there a way I can run a function on only that html & not the entire page?
[14:04:54] <javalover> so for example I have a thumbnail creator....
[14:05:13] <javalover> can I run the function to the thumbnails of the new html & not to the entire page?
[14:05:25] <grafi> JFranks http://www.unheap.com/?s=captcha maybe that'll help you
[14:05:58] <javalover> $('#mydiv')..append(data)   & data is html, can I somehow run my thumbnail code on the data first?
[14:06:14] <SiM0nA> I have copy of this: http://www.tafi.vibs.bg/offices.php here: http://tafi.igrata.org/offices.php but where is five pictures on copy don't open in popup with script like in first url.
[14:08:05] <carpii> i have a floating div which I want to hide() when mouse leaves its bounding box. But this div contains a few other divs, and atm the mouseout event is being fired when i hover over a child div, and so the entire div disappeares (which I dont want).  Whats the usual way to handle this?
[14:08:56] <carpii> ah got it, i need to use mouseleave rather than mouseout
[14:09:34] <Xander1> @grafi http://jsfiddle.net/UHZz6/ - here's a jsfiddle - if you click to launch modal window and then pick the time, but don't click submit, and click outside of teh modal, and modal goes away, but when u start it up again - input fields are clear, but the timepicker slider is still set on the previous selection
[14:10:15] <grafi> and you want all to be "unset" ?
[14:10:34] <Xander1> yeah
[14:10:44] <Xander1> i.e. as if it jsut started up again
[14:10:52] <Xander1> pretty much a form reset
[14:11:00] <carpii> im fidning that both fields are still populated when reopening the dialog (on chrome)
[14:11:38] <grafi> hm
[14:11:45] <grafi> for me nothing reset oô
[14:11:48] <grafi> *resets
[14:11:51] <JFranks> grafi: I like that idea.. hmmm.. something custom.. where it says "Slide the matching Homophone for 'Where'" and then present "Hair, Wear, Weir, What" .. ?
[14:11:52] <carpii> but thats not surprising since #myModal remains in the DOM and is just hidden
[14:12:32] <mw44118> Hi -- is there a good plugin for doing data binding with jquery, so that i can update a JS object and have several DOM nodes update?
[14:12:33] <grafi> JFranks well something like this is probably easy to set up
[14:13:04] <Xander1> ok, check this out - http://jsfiddle.net/UHZz6/2/
[14:13:08] <Xander1> updated it a bit
[14:13:21] <javalover> help please super confused
[14:13:53] <grafi> Xander1 ok, i see
[14:13:55] <javalover> i use .get to grab html returned as var data.   I then append this data to existing element.  Is there a way to call jquery function on the html BEFORE i append it?
[14:14:14] <javalover> or even after, I just don't want to call same function on existing element....
[14:14:15] <JFranks> grafi: yeah.. trick is to make it custom and to make the end result tricky to detect a failure.. that 2nd part could also use some JS love.. ie: the HTML is the same but the JS will fetch an AJAX response and update the page.. ?
[14:14:22] <carpii> Xander, if you want to keep the dialog in DOM, you should write an init() for it and call that before its displayed
[14:14:51] <carpii> then set $(".slider").value(0);
[14:15:10] <grafi> JFranks for the form I use with my hidden input i just always display a "thank you" message whenever javascript says the values validate
[14:15:10] <carpii> sorry, i mean    $(".slider").slider("value", 0);
[14:15:32] <Xander1> @carpii - could you please guide me in a right direction of init()…not familiar with that
[14:15:45] <grafi> so even if the hidden input is filled out it going to look like a successfull transaction
[14:16:33] <javalover> HELP!
[14:16:35] <carpii> Xander, ok ill try, but I dont use jquery ui
[14:17:02] <Xander1> all good - i just need ot see some sample
[14:17:20] <carpii> also no need to use document.getElementById when you ave jQuery   ->   $("#datpickerform") instead
[14:17:32] <Xander1> ah ok, got it
[14:22:48] <mw44118> anybody in here have any opinions on data-binding libraries?
[14:27:28] <JFranks> Hahaha... "Please draw 'a flower' .. it does not need to be a very complex drawing of 'a flower' just something our staff will see as a match to the phrase 'a flower' so the email can be forwarded to management."
[14:31:32] <grafi> xD
[14:32:21] <grafi> some poor slave looking at flowers all day
[14:33:37] <aldodelgado> Question? I have this query loop on an object i'm getting back from an ajax post. http://pastebin.com/d8e5QYKW However when I run it in my code I get each charter as its own return rather then the 5 objects I get back when I run it in the console.
[14:33:43] <aldodelgado> jquery*
[14:35:33] <Xander1> hmm got the timepicker slider to "clear up"
[14:39:09] <Xander1> for now i basically setDate to current time and then reset the form
[14:39:27] <Xander1> i got a feeling that there's gotta be a different way of reseting timepickers
[14:39:28] <Xander1> sliders
[14:39:53] <aldodelgado> never mind found this http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11347825/why-doesnt-this-jquery-each-loop-through-json-data-correctly and fixed it with http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11347825/why-doesnt-this-jquery-each-loop-through-json-data-correctly
[14:51:00] <grafi> Xander1 from my googling it seems that theres really not a good way to reset it ... so take your win :P
[14:51:33] <Xander1> @grafi - yeah, i been googling for awhile now and can't find a good solution at all
[14:51:44] <dieguezz> hi, i am trying to sum fields into a select and works. the problem is when i have a multiselect, they don't sum. Can anyone help me? this is my jquery: http://bpaste.net/show/ozvuWQEcUE8rmzJUqDAp/
[14:51:58] <grafi> seems odd that the date/timepickers dont have a simple reset method
[14:52:23] <Xander1> lol yeha, that's what i thought - it's be something "simple", but nope
[14:54:06] <syclopa> So, I've got a bit of a headachegenerator right now.  I've got a page that loads new content via .get  THe problem I'm having is that after new content is retrieved and displayed, I can't seem to get interactivity with it.  (e.g. $('#ms').click(function (){
[14:54:07] <syclopa>             $('.container').html("Do something here");
[14:54:08] <syclopa>             }); won't work when #ms is loaded from a get)  any thoughts?
[15:10:04] <mw44118> scottalan: oh, yeah, you gotta re-rig up the new stuff
[15:10:38] <mw44118> scottalan: document.ready already fired and it doesn't re-fire, so your new nodes don't have those click event handlers
[15:10:50] <mw44118> scottalan: this is a classic problem
[15:11:06] <mw44118> scottalan: read up on .live() for one solution
[15:14:26] <syclopa> thanks
[15:18:11] <Xander1> in jquery, is there a way to run script when URL is equal to something?
[15:18:11] <syclopa> great, found a way to work it with .on rather than .live
[15:28:13] <mw44118> syclopa: what other way?
[15:31:06] <tieTYT> i'm trying to disable all inputs nested under an id like this: $("#current-equipment input").prop("disabled", true)
[15:31:38] <tieTYT> but when I referesh the page, it toggles between disabling all inputs and disabling the inputs I wanted.  Why is this happening?
[15:31:55] <tieTYT> all I do is refresh the page and I get a different result
[15:32:06] <duch_kazatel> "when i refresh the page" <- do you mean an actual page refresh?
[15:32:11] <tieTYT> yep
[15:32:19] <tieTYT> by clicking the button in my browser
[15:32:45] <duch_kazatel> the markup is likely changing it.
[15:32:52] <duch_kazatel> err, the markup is likely changing.
[15:33:03] <tieTYT> maybe if I use the class names of the buttons instead of "input" that'll work better
[15:33:13] <duch_kazatel> nah, shouldn't matter.
[15:33:23] <duch_kazatel> the page refresh shouldn't have that kind of impact.
[15:33:45] <duch_away> brb
[15:34:33] <tieTYT> you're right, it's not making a difference
[15:37:28] <Xander1> how can i reload bootstrap tab content upon successful ajax call
[15:52:35] <tieTYT> this is really weird, all the fields are disabled before my line that disables them
[15:54:35] <tieTYT> but if I remove that line, it never disables any buttons
[15:55:29] <duch_kazatel> wait what?
[17:07:10] <`f`o`o`m`a`n> why do the docs for .hover() say it's the same as mouseenter/mouseleave, when it's actually implemented on top of mouseover/mouseout?
[17:10:13] <grafi> `f`o`o`m`a`n what?
[17:13:55] <`f`o`o`m`a`n> grafi: if you inspect the "originalEvent" to a listener added with .hover(), you'll see it's a "mouseover" event rather than a "mouseleave" event
[17:15:04] <`f`o`o`m`a`n> grafi: "rather than a *mouseenter event"... i wonder why that is.  both the consuming jQuery event and the documentation describe it as "mouseenter", rather than "mouseover"
[17:21:08] <Xander1> anyone got good multi-select plugin?
[17:21:14] <Xander1> i meant know of one
[17:21:18] <Xander1> or a few good ones
[17:21:29] <larixk> http://harvesthq.github.io/chosen/
[17:21:32] <grafi> try unheap.com maybe Xander1 they have pretty cool stuff
[17:22:26] <Xander1> looked at Chosen already - doesn't look like it's wha ti need it to do
[17:22:40] <Xander1> http://bennylin.net/jquery-plugin-light-weight-multiselect/ - something kind of like this one
[17:23:17] <Xander1> but when items move into "accepted column" - i need to "activate" a corresponding row of checkboxes next to that item
[17:23:35] <jedimind> that should be relatively straight forward to add on
[17:23:36] <Xander1> @grafi thanks for the link - will look into it
[17:25:11] <grafi> `f`o`o`m`a`n thats interesting
[17:30:45] <grafi> `f`o`o`m`a`n reading thorugh the docs a bit i guess there is no original event for "mouseenter" js has only the mouseover (?!)
[17:31:30] <grafi> the difference between mouseover and mouseenter being how event bubbling is handled, see the mouseenter docs
[17:38:25] <`f`o`o`m`a`n> grafi: I was aware of difference b/t mouseenter and mouseover...  both are, AFAIK, broadly supported.  Just wondered about that discrepancy.  wouldn't have brought it up if it didn't cause me a moment of head-scratching earlier
[18:19:00] <dshap> hey all - is anyone here familiar with jquery-svg?  http://keith-wood.name/svg.html  -- I'm reading the source and trying to figure out how I can simply convert an SVG string into a parsed dom object. looks like the interface they provide is to first select an svg element that must already be in the dom =\
[18:48:40] <true-techie> http://jsbin.com/AXeqEVi/1/ how can i store the value of the inputs locally within the function that i attached to this form's button?
[20:23:28] <ppppp_> Anyone know a good tutorial to get me started used AJAX to post to a PHP page?
[20:25:48] <obert> ppppp_: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5143191/inserting-into-mysql-from-php-jquery-ajax
[20:26:04] <ppppp_> thx obert
[20:27:36] <obert> you are welcome
[20:28:03] <V8Energy> is there some kind of jquery plugin that will act as event source? basically I have a url which keeps the stream open and keeps  on sending json data. I want to be able to listen to the json data that comes in and react to the data accordingly
[20:28:42] <V8Energy> i don't want to use FireFox and Chrome's  EventSource, I need something that will work in IE9 as well
[20:59:57] <Serpiente> can anyone tell me what's the minimal required jquery version for qtip2
[21:32:51] <BrunoMarlan> hi
[21:33:06] <BrunoMarlan> alguem do Brasil ?
[21:50:57] <pawz> hi. does jqueryui have an excel-style spreadsheet method of data entry ? i think i have seen stuff like that for layout.. but can you use it for data input too ?
[22:00:00] <lonequid> is there something like .one() except it happens once per pageload, not once per element?
[22:02:17] <lonequid> I want to fire an event on the first time a link is clicked, but only the first time
[22:04:09] <lonequid> I guess I could use .on and .off and call the .on() on pageload but that seems messy
[22:04:19] <pawz> well, just embed the event within an if statement which checks if you have set a global variable indicating it's been clicked before
[22:05:49] <lonequid> that works too
[22:22:41] <lonequid> thanks pawz
[23:02:21] <jtri> hello, i have a container div with two divs inside, one of the inside div's has a checkbox triggering events.  I'd like to find the text of the other inside div, can anyone help me with the selector?
[23:03:07] <jtri> all three divs have classes, i.e. gtd_container, gtd_checkbox, and gtd_text
[23:03:29] <Cork> jtri: could you make a fiddle please?
[23:03:43] <Cork> ?p
[23:03:50] <Cork> bah
[23:04:02] <Cork> jtri: http://jsfiddle.net/
[23:07:25] <jtri> http://jsfiddle.net/TLuCp/
[23:07:51] <Cork> jtri: and the click event is on?
[23:07:57] <Cork> survey_response?
[23:09:50] <jtri> the checkbox input
[23:10:04] <jtri> it's applied via jquery after the fact...
[23:10:13] <jtri> the event is happening fine
[23:10:23] <Cork> jtri: the jquery code to bind the event listener would help
[23:11:02] <jtri> using this to bind the listener: $(".gtd_checkbox :checkbox").change(function (e)
[23:11:08] <Cork> ok
[23:12:48] <Cork> jtri: http://jsfiddle.net/TLuCp/1/
[23:15:33] <jtri> thank you :)  it was the text() that was throing me, i tried html(), and couldn't see any hits from console.log ...
[23:15:56] <Cork> jtri: .html() would work just as well
[23:16:09] <Cork> except it would give you possible html tags in there too
[23:16:21] <Cork> .text() strips those
[23:16:57] <jtri> ok, now that i look closer, i was off by more..  let me try to describe this: $(this).closest('.gtd_checkbox').next()
[23:17:27] <jtri> i already clicked a checkbox, why isn't this or $(this) already the checkbox?
[23:17:37] <Cork> jtri: it is
[23:17:52] <jtri> so why look for the closest of the same class?
[23:18:09] <Cork> jtri: the input doesn't have any class
[23:18:18] <Cork> jtri: you bind the event on the input, not the div
[23:18:57] <Cork> jtri: so closest finds the parent div with the class
[23:19:09] <Cork> then next() finds the next sibling of the div
[23:19:17] <Cork> and then .text() grabs the text content of that div
[23:19:32] <jtri> but what if i wanted it to be more robust?
[23:19:42] <jtri> and find the gtd_text specificially
[23:19:47] <Cork> that is fairly robust
[23:19:51] <jtri> assuming perhaps another div slides in there..
[23:20:05] <Cork> but you could replace next with nextAll('.gtd_text').first()
[23:23:18] <frdmn> i
[23:41:05] <g33kyboi> hello there
[23:41:28] <jtri> exit
[23:41:35] <jtri> :)
[23:44:32] <g33kyboi> am having issues ajaxing my displaytag table urls... when a link is clicked i redirect to a portlet resourceURL which works fine. the problem is the response which is the displaytag table is not inserted into the div.... I use this to set the div $('#divid').html(htmlString)
[23:45:18] <Cork> g33kyboi: and  $('#divid').length > 0 ?
[23:45:26] <g33kyboi> yes...
[23:45:41] <Cork> g33kyboi: code please
[23:45:55] <g33kyboi> when i check the console in chrome, i see the response; a well formed html table
[23:48:35] <g33kyboi> http://pastebin.com/8m3KfMGR
[23:50:19] <Cork> g33kyboi: why don't you just do $('#' + eleId).html($(resp).find('#' + eleId)) ?
[23:51:00] <Cork> hmm though you want the content
[23:51:10] <Cork> g33kyboi: so $('#' + eleId).html($(resp).find('#' + eleId).html())
