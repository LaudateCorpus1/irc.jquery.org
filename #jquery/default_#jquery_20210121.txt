[03:33:30] <EugenA> I have two frames, from frame B I try to trigger submit for a form in frame A. All frames are reloaded after that.. why?
[03:33:54] <EugenA> $('#showFromIdForm', window.parent.frames[1].document).submit();
[03:39:02] <Cork> EugenA: all frames on the same domain?
[03:39:14] <EugenA> yes
[03:39:15] <Cork> (including form, and so on)
[03:39:22] <Cork> ...
[03:39:26] <Cork> including port and so on i meant
[03:39:44] <EugenA> yes
[03:40:14] <Cork> might be an event handler on the form your triggering jquery submit events on
[03:40:33] <Cork> note $('#showFromIdForm', window.parent.frames[1].document).submit() != $('#showFromIdForm', window.parent.frames[1].document)[0].submit()
[03:41:22] <Cork> (the first triggers all submit event handlers that if nothing prevents it ends up triggering the submit function on the dom element
[03:41:41] <Cork> and the second just fires the dom submit function skipping all the handlers)
[03:51:21] <EugenA> also $('#showFromIdForm', window.parent.frames[1].document)[0].submit() reloads the frames
[04:00:22] <EugenA> this is current code https://pastebin.com/7DC8sczE
