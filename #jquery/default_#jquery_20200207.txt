[05:56:07] <silv3r_m00n> hi i am modifying the checked attribute of input type checkboxes like this attr('checked', true); it works sometimes but not sometimes... and sometimes the checked="checked" attribute is present in dom inspector but the checkbox does not show the tick mark
[05:56:10] <silv3r_m00n> why is that happening
[06:34:31] <primitivMedia> https://codepen.io/PrimitivMedia/pen/GRJgKEP i have ta list of ul li's with a third level nav
[06:34:36] <primitivMedia> having issues triggering it to work
[06:34:43] <primitivMedia> i think propagation is my issue
[06:34:57] <primitivMedia> the headings in bols are the second / third level navs
[06:35:01] <primitivMedia> in caps***
[08:38:44] <primitivMedia> i have an li element with an i element inside
[08:38:46] <primitivMedia> https://bpaste.net/LBHA
[08:39:00] <primitivMedia> when u click no the li element it should change the closest i element
[08:39:20] <primitivMedia> right now im using just .find but it ends up targetting all decendant i elements as well not just the immediate child of the element i clicked
[08:39:45] <Cork> primitivMedia: use .children()
[08:42:50] <undefined_bob> did you fixed the "annoying configuration problem" the other day, Cork?
[08:46:06] <primitivMedia> .children does not work
[08:46:09] <primitivMedia> it gives the same output
[08:46:11] <Cork> undefined_bob: ya
[08:46:25] <primitivMedia> https://codepen.io/PrimitivMedia/pen/jOPEEye
[08:46:29] <primitivMedia> this is my html
[08:46:46] <Cork> primitivMedia: then they are not decendands but children
[08:46:58] <primitivMedia> so would i need to use closest?
[08:48:18] <Cork> closest() looks at parents
[08:48:32] <primitivMedia> im clicking on the li
[08:48:39] <primitivMedia> so what would i use . closest with
[08:48:51] <Cork> what is it you want to find?
[08:49:00] <primitivMedia> the i with the chevron
[08:49:11] <primitivMedia> but the closest one to the clicken menu-parent
[08:49:22] <primitivMedia> as there is a third level nav which gets toggled at thr same time
[08:49:41] <Cork> closest child or closest parent?
[08:49:49] <Cork> there is no graphically closest
[08:51:44] <primitivMedia> i need to find the closest i tag when u click on the li with menu-parent class
[08:51:51] <primitivMedia> in this case there are two i tags with chevron
[08:52:01] <primitivMedia> so whicheverr is clicest to the clicked element i need to work with that
[08:59:53] <Cork> primitivMedia: the cheveron classes is just <i></i> elements you can't really find them from click events without finding there parent
[09:00:07] <primitivMedia> i know that
[09:00:10] <primitivMedia> so how do i do this
[09:00:28] <Cork> well it depends on where you bind the click handler
[09:01:01] <Cork> if you find it on the menu-parent element it would be $(this).children('.fa-chevron-down')
[09:09:29] <primitivMedia> im binding it on the li
[09:09:33] <primitivMedia> with class menu-parent
[09:11:33] <primitivMedia> that worked thank you sir!
[13:49:46] <f0rs3ti> Hi .. anyone here familiar with jcubic/jquery-terminal ?? I have a simple website like a terminal resume ... but its not working on mobile .. acording to documentaion it should only need the meta viewport which i have but is still not working any hints? here is sample code: https://github.com/4s3ti/terminalCV  the only difference from what is there to my local setup atm is jquery version and jquery terminal versions (using latest versions)
[13:51:08] <f0rs3ti> the imports with new versions: https://paste.4s3ti.net/?1905f3defb5eeccb#HsefVSwWYFZfpVT7E4pQtYNEyu4wLJfeLfQPiBDSBsY7
