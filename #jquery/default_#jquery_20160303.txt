[02:34:53] <_bogus_> hi there.. can anyone tell me a good and simple wizard plugin ? i just need to separate my form in three parts, but i have custom buttons for next/prev and custom breadcrumbs.. what i need is very simple but all the plugins i tried so far makes this customization a little hard to do
[02:35:32] <renka> good morning. :)
[03:02:20] <hellyeah> so this is not delegation hm  $('#new').on('click', createANewDatepickerSection);
[03:06:53] <slax0r> hellyeah: no, it's not
[03:07:32] <slax0r> $(parent).on('child', 'click', function) is
[03:07:52] <slax0r> child being #new in your case
[03:10:08] <hellyeah> so
[03:10:12] <hellyeah> just a sec
[03:24:44] <hellyeah> slax0r:  i am sorry it is simple question but why it is not firing http://jsfiddle.net/eyg50d75/18/
[03:31:20] <AcidRain> http://pastebin.com/K8JG9y0A
[03:31:30] <AcidRain> issue: im getting undefined index on php side
[03:38:23] <PSan> what's the best way to only send changed inputs of a form to POST ?
[03:46:01] <jpast> Hi friends. I need a jquery help, anyone?
[04:11:02] <Xatenev> jpast: maybe ask
[04:11:18] <Xatenev> PSan: on('change' ?
[04:12:36] <Xatenev> AcidRain: you sure that ss1 has the right value?
[04:12:47] <Xatenev> AcidRain: I think its no file object.
[04:12:48] <jpast> I have a landing page, first it appears the age verification, when yes is clicked it hides it and shows main webiste in parallax, but when this happens the page gets bad until window resize
[04:12:53] <jpast> any solutions here?
[04:12:59] <jpast> or how do I resize it?
[04:14:42] <PSan> yes I used on change and an array to keep track of it
[04:14:55] <PSan> then on the form submit event attr('disabled', 'disabled')
[04:17:44] <thej> any  place where can i check my CLA status ?
[04:19:47] <PSan> is there an event I can add that fires whenever an element of a specific class gets added to the document?
[04:20:13] <Xatenev> PSan: who is adding the element with a specific class, you?
[04:20:50] <PSan> yes
[04:20:59] <Xatenev> PSan: so forget about the event
[04:21:08] <Xatenev> and just execute the code at the place where you add the element :)
[04:21:21] <PSan> but I want that piece of functionality to be generic :(
[04:23:38] <PSan> so then I'll have to remember to register it everytime I use this functionality
[04:23:44] <PSan> no big deal I guess
[04:30:58] <Xatenev> PSan: i dont get what you mean by "register it everytime"
[04:30:59] <Xatenev> but sure
[04:31:12] <PSan> like adding change listeners to the inputs
[04:31:42] <Xatenev> You register your listeners once if you need something on change
[04:31:43] <Xatenev> obviously
[05:04:48] <Omar-> morning
[05:31:00] <DevAntoine`> hi
[05:31:11] <DevAntoine`> why can't I chain .data to .attr('foo', bar)?
[05:32:03] <jop008> hi I got this in chrome how to avoid this?
[05:32:04] <jop008> http://picpaste.com/Screen_Shot_2016-03-03_at_11.30.50-6VkpMDxD.png
[05:32:33] <DevAntoine`> jop008, it's a server side thing
[05:32:51] <jop008> I googled the only thing I found was this I tried header_remove('Set-Cookie');
[05:33:00] <jop008> I will try php room
[05:33:15] <DevAntoine`> jop008, what your headers look like in the network panel?
[05:34:08] <jop008> I try to find this out but I could not find it the size was within limits
[05:35:54] <jop008> see here http://picpaste.com/Screen_Shot_2016-03-03_at_11.35.06-dwuXNOej.png
[05:36:06] <jop008> how to find the heasder?
[05:37:07] <DevAntoine`> jop008, https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/network#http-headers
[05:37:32] <DevAntoine`> why the hell can't I chain .attr to .data when .attr() returns a jQuery object????
[05:37:33] <DevAntoine`> WTF
[05:39:04] <Uhkis> calm down!
[05:39:58] <jop008> The Headers tab displays the resource's request URL,  but where is that tab
[05:39:59] <Uhkis> DevAntoine`: have you tried prop instead
[05:41:23] <DevAntoine`> nop, I wanted to use attr
[05:41:39] <DevAntoine`> but nevermind I'll just pass an object inside attr to not use data after
[05:41:53] <DevAntoine`> but I don't understand what's happening, and I hate that
[05:44:34] <jop008> I found the headers tab the only thing there is failed to load response data
[05:46:57] <jop008> This is the view on the ehaders which failed http://picpaste.com/Screen_Shot_2016-03-03_at_11.30.50-4PUpj3SA.png
[05:47:12] <jop008> nothing special ...
[05:50:42] <Uhkis> jop008: you have something crazy happening on the backend side
[05:50:58] <jop008> good tip
[05:51:40] <jop008> all browsers okay but fails in chrome
[05:52:20] <Uhkis> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3326210/can-http-headers-be-too-big-for-browsers says firefox has the smallest header limit
[05:52:40] <Uhkis> old, so things might have changed
[05:53:23] <Uhkis> jop008: what happens if you just go to that url normally, not via ajax?
[05:54:05] <jop008> in chorme sometimes no data
[05:54:23] <jop008> if I start a new incognito window sometimes okay
[05:54:31] <jop008> so not stable
[05:55:54] <Uhkis> do you have control over that backend?
[05:56:53] <jop008> yes I am the owner
[05:57:17] <Uhkis> so start debugging your headers :P
[05:57:22] <jop008> backend is linux php json feedback with ajax using jquery mobile
[05:58:15] <jop008> I watched the headers in firefox but nothing special how can you influence headers I only do echo json at backed
[05:58:32] <DevAntoine`> your headers obviously have an issue
[05:58:46] <DevAntoine`> as I said it's not a client side bug
[05:59:41] <jop008> I agree but php chat room is like bjork all so quiet
[06:01:02] <DevAntoine`> jop008, are you even manipulating the headers server side?
[06:01:04] <Uhkis> jop008: so the headers were normal on ff? every time?
[06:01:07] <DevAntoine`> How is it send?
[06:01:22] <jop008> yes
[06:01:46] <jop008> in my pho class I do echo json data
[06:02:20] <Uhkis> might be some chrome bug too of course
[06:02:47] <jop008> no I am tottally a nit wit on headers so I don't manipulate them on purpose
[06:03:15] <jop008> but we find it on windows chrome and apple chrome
[06:03:46] <jop008> and strange that if you start a new window everything runs smoothly
[06:03:54] <Uhkis> google sending stuff to NSA and headers get too big ;D
[06:05:15] <Uhkis> jop008: that kinda sounds like a bug, but you still need to debug your headers first
[06:06:18] <jop008> If  I know how to do that ....
[06:07:02] <Uhkis> php has a function to get headers
[06:23:52] <jop008> but what to do if all browsers are fine and sometimes chrome is also okay is tit really a header issue?
[06:26:37] <Hollusionist> how do i identify what html element a jquery object is? $('.selector').getHtmlElement() should return 'div' or 'input'
[06:26:50] <Hollusionist> whatever .selector is
[06:29:55] <Hollusionist> .prop('nodeName'); seems to be it
[06:31:08] <Hollusionist> .prop('tagName'); or should i use this?
[06:46:30] <mr> hi
[06:47:14] <mr> any help on how to make this work? http://jsfiddle.net/GPhcc/45/
[06:47:19] <mr> please
[06:58:06] <mr> how to do a insertBefore with a slideDown? http://jsfiddle.net/GPhcc/45/
[07:19:04] <Hollusionist> mr: be more specific
[07:29:59] <mindbubble> Hee guys, Got a vieuw question regarding json_encode to  transfer data from mysql db to use in javascript. Can I do a while $row fetch so I  can controll the amout of output to use?
[07:30:15] <mindbubble> Kind a nieuw to Jquery
[07:38:14] <mindbubble> Some one who can help?
[07:46:18] <slax0r> mindbubble: you're doing php...
[07:46:21] <slax0r> not jquery
[07:47:39] <harjotsingh> hi, I'm new to jquery , I would like to know how to contribute
[08:14:39] <mr> Hollusionist I wanna add a bit of animation to the move up/down movement of the element of a table but it's not working. Take a look at http://jsfiddle.net/GPhcc/46/
[08:16:01] <Hollusionist> mr onclick="movedownlink(this)"
[08:16:03] <Hollusionist> dont do this
[08:17:01] <Hollusionist> $('.move-up').click(function(e) { content of moveuplinkfunction() });
[08:19:43] <Hollusionist> .hide().slideDown(800)
[08:20:06] <Hollusionist> if you hide before using slideDown() the effect will have no effect ;)
[08:20:12] <Hollusionist> you dont need to hide()
[08:20:20] <Hollusionist> slideDown() hides after the effect has finished
[08:22:20] <mr> I will rewrite and try Hollusionits
[08:22:30] <mr> I will try Hollusionist
[08:28:01] <interop_madness> i have a div, which is positioned absolutely. after the following call:             $this.css("left", (left + translateX) + "px");
[08:28:01] <interop_madness>        the value of div.outerHeight(true) has changed. the div hade a non-empty "left" css property before, set to 0px. why does outerHeight change in this scenario?
[08:28:24] <mr> Hollusionist I tried several time to avoid the onclick but never worked. Don't know why. The function is never called.
[08:28:51] <mr> If I remove the hide() and leave the slidedown only th change is made by no animation at all
[08:35:36] <interop_madness> any help with my outerHeight() problem?
[08:37:18] <shoky_> interop_madness make a jsfiddle
[08:38:13] <interop_madness> i'd rather have guesses tbh
[08:38:23] <interop_madness> isolating the problem would take roughly a day
[08:39:00] <Hollusionist> mr: http://jsfiddle.net/GPhcc/47/ this is not perfect but you can learn from it ;)
[08:44:24] <interop_madness> the outerHeight() problem seems reproducible among all browsers
[08:44:36] <shoky_> interop_madness my guess is that something you are doing is changing the outerHeight. :_)
[08:45:31] <interop_madness> shoky_, $this.outerHeight(true) changes literally direcly after this call: $this.css("left", (left + translateX) + "px");
[08:45:51] <shoky_> doesn't change my guess
[08:45:55] <interop_madness> nothing else happens, no timers are invoked and nothing is added or removed from the DOM
[08:46:06] <interop_madness> so that's the isolated thing
[08:46:19] <shoky_> sounds pretty easy to isolate into a jsfiddle, then
[08:52:35] <mr> thanks Hollusionist. I will take a deep look at it. Thanks
[08:57:39] <Hollusionist> mr: you have to understand the asynchronity of effects, thats why i put the "move tr to another location" code into the callback function of fadeOut() to make sure it happens AFTER the effect has finished
[08:58:51] <jquery748> Fellas
[08:59:04] <jquery748> Is anyone here familiary with parsley ??
[08:59:09] <jquery748> *familiar
[08:59:18] <Hollusionist> mr: you should also consider hiding the "move up" button if the tr is the first one and hiding the "move down" button if its the last one in the table
[08:59:31] <interop_madness> nope, not reproducible in isolation. guesses still welcome.
[08:59:44] <Hollusionist> mr: or implemen a check if r.prev() exists
[08:59:48] <Hollusionist> *implement
[09:00:13] <Hollusionist> interop_madness: you cant expect us to play sherlock holmes with you. :)
[09:00:18] <mr> yes that would be a good optimisation :) Hollusionist. I'll check it out
[09:01:03] <interop_madness> no, i don't expect it. i'm hoping for miracles, because i'm out of ideas
[09:01:28] <Hollusionist> interop_madness: did you use the debugger? you can go through your code, step by step and see when exactly the height changes
[09:01:40] <Hollusionist> or detect code that interacts with the height
[09:01:49] <jquery748> Can someone check this out? https://gist.github.com/anonymous/964c1d360036d0ffcdca
[09:02:00] <jquery748> I am having a porblem using jquery with parlsey\
[09:02:04] <interop_madness> Hollusionist, the height changes exactly after the following line has executed:  $this.css("left", (left + translateX) + "px");
[09:02:36] <interop_madness> Hollusionist, i have made sure that before execution of that exact line, the wrong/old value was returned for outerHeight()
[09:02:59] <jquery748> I want my code to calidate a fielld AND then generate a new one, but it is only generating the field based on email. I want it to validate all THREE fields and then generate te next row of fields
[09:03:28] <Hollusionist> interop_madness: where do you define "left"
[09:03:43] <Hollusionist> jquery748: http://jsfiddle.net
[09:04:15] <interop_madness> Hollusionist, somewhere before that.  (left + translateX) are known to evaluate to a non-null, non-undefined, non-zero number
[09:04:24] <Hollusionist> interop_madness: would be good to see the definitions of left and translateX
[09:05:00] <Hollusionist> console.log(left + translateX) returns int?
[09:05:11] <interop_madness> Hollusionist,  var left = parseInt($this.css("left").replace(pxRegex, ""), 10);
[09:05:22] <interop_madness> Hollusionist,   var pxRegex = /px$/;
[09:06:00] <Hollusionist> interop_madness: did you consider using .position() ?
[09:07:46] <interop_madness> Hollusionist, yes, console.log(left + translateX) returns int
[09:08:13] <Hollusionist> do you want to animate $this ?
[09:08:40] <Hollusionist> what is the goal here
[09:09:20] <interop_madness> i want to absolutely position an element
[09:09:28] <interop_madness> context ist graph drawing
[09:09:30] <interop_madness> -t
[09:09:43] <Hollusionist> try using position() instead of css maybe that helps
[09:10:21] <BernieTrump> GUYS! hola. I want to validate a form's specific field
[09:10:32] <BernieTrump> what kind of listener would I use?
[09:10:41] <interop_madness> nope, same problem
[09:12:17] <interop_madness> does it affect outerHeight() if an element is not entirely visible within the container
[09:13:24] <interop_madness> more precisely: does it affect outerHeight() if top and/or left are negative values?
[09:13:46] <Hollusionist> you could easily test is in the dev console
[09:13:49] <Hollusionist> *it
[09:15:26] <interop_madness> apparently not
[09:22:41] <interop_madness> ok, it seems it can be narrowed down to a pure JS problem. the same problem persists with getBoundingClientRect()
[10:25:38] <sigdk> the datatables plugin website says: "The form $().dataTable() will return a jQuery object, while $().DataTable() returns a DataTables API instance."... I still don't understand the difference
[10:25:44] <sigdk> which one should I use ?
[10:28:39] <Uhkis> depends on what youre doing sigdk
[10:29:12] <sigdk> Uhkis, you don't help me either :)
[10:29:40] <Uhkis> sigdk: and we can't help you if you keep it a secret
[10:30:23] <decx> one holds the element one holds the data
[10:30:34] <decx> having never used datatables, what's so hard to get about that
[10:35:25] <sigdk> decx, my backend sends a json object with 4 fields as shown here: https://datatables.net/manual/server-side . so if I use DataTables I will have only the "data" field at hand ?
[10:42:56] <nds_> im trying to load a json file async, but 	$.ajaxSetup( { "async": false } ); gives "Synchronous XMLHttpRequest on the main thread is deprecated because of its detrimental effects to the end user's experience ..."
[10:45:04] <DevAntoine`> I want to execute a function when jquery's dialog is opened, how can I do that?
[10:45:13] <DevAntoine`> Can I do it without event listener?
[10:49:36] <decx> did you read the api?
[10:50:46] <DevAntoine`> decx
[10:50:50] <DevAntoine`> and I'm kinda lost
[10:51:22] <DevAntoine`> *yeah
[10:51:38] <decx> the part where it says: events dialogopen :p
[10:52:07] <DevAntoine`> decx, the two examples are the same?
[10:52:27] <decx> that's not the api that's examples
[10:53:12] <DevAntoine`> that link https://api.jqueryui.com/dialog/#event-open
[10:53:13] <DevAntoine`> ?
[10:55:57] <decx> how is that not clear?
[10:57:24] <DevAntoine`> as I'm asking decx, are the two snippets provided the same?
[10:57:43] <DevAntoine`> the first one working like a callback and the second one like an event?
[10:57:44] <decx> sure
[10:57:53] <decx> it says so right there in the text ^^
[10:58:51] <DevAntoine`> not that clear in my sleepy mind I guess :/
[11:01:17] <DevAntoine`> decx: I got fu**** by the fact that the callback was already defined
[11:01:24] <DevAntoine`> but I'm working in a 6k loc file
[11:01:27] <DevAntoine`> not that easy
[11:18:26] <mikes000> Is it possible to remove an element from the page on click after calling all of the attached listeners?
[11:22:11] <decx> everything's possible
[11:22:25] <decx> keep state, do stufff
[11:24:30] <mikes000> deep
[11:27:18] <decx> maybe be more vague
[11:27:22] <decx> ^^
[11:31:26] <mikes000> How do you to remove an element from the page on click after all event listeners are called?
[11:33:02] <Noobnr1> https://jsfiddle.net/ewLa082k/ I want to pass the button value to the other php file. I've tried changing the data to data: {"filename":fname,"directory":directory,"knapp":knapp}, But it's not working..
[11:56:55] <stennowork> good day, if i call .show() on an element which has the style display: none; initially, will it always get display:block through this? is there a way to specify display: inline-block instead when calling .show() ?
[11:57:45] <robertmaxrees> stennowork just use a class at that point.
[11:57:50] <stennowork> maybe i shouldn't use .show() but just set the display
[11:57:51] <robertmaxrees> add/remove one t get what you want.
[11:57:57] <stennowork> yeah figured
[11:58:16] <decx> show will actually use the correct term based on the type of element
[11:58:29] <robertmaxrees> ^ it'll use whatever the default display attribute is.
[11:58:38] <stennowork> alright i see
[11:58:47] <stennowork> as this is a <div> thats why its display:block then
[11:58:59] <stennowork> i see, that cleared it up, thanks!
[12:31:20] <z1haze> can someone help me with having undefined errors when using require() to include a package.. but using <script src in the body causes no errors
[12:39:58] <shoky_> z1haze i can try. tho this doesn't sound jquery related
[12:42:16] <robertmaxrees> he's crossposting - they've got him over in ##javascript.
[12:42:59] <shoky_> meh. i used to join there just to avoid such crossposts, but.. meh.
[12:43:20] <robertmaxrees> yeah... kind of bugs me when people do that but meh.
[12:43:25] <shoky_> z1haze: meh!
[12:45:15] <z1haze> shoky_, so made some progress
[12:45:25] <z1haze> this is totally diff
[12:45:37] <z1haze> that thing you helped me with with great
[12:45:52] <z1haze> robertmaxrees, what wrong with crossposter
[12:46:18] <shoky_> z1haze: you just saw what's wrong with it. i'm not on ##javascript and didn't know people are already helping you with the same question
[12:46:20] <z1haze> i posted in #browserify too i see no issue
[12:46:25] <robertmaxrees> wastes our time trying to help you :)
[12:46:36] <z1haze> if you read it robertmaxrees hes stumped
[12:46:50] <z1haze> <falafel> now Im stumped
[12:46:53] <robertmaxrees> when you finish in one place, feel free to go to another :)
[12:47:10] <robertmaxrees> but posting in all three to start with is sort of counterproductive imo.
[12:47:27] <z1haze> i see it as quite the opposite, but to each their own
[12:47:38] <robertmaxrees> most people tend to agree with me fwiw.
[12:47:40] <robertmaxrees> but sure :)
[12:47:51] <z1haze> running things in parallel seems to always be more productive than in series
[12:48:01] <shoky_> it's greedy :S or at least feels like it
[12:48:04] <robertmaxrees> it's a waste of our time, not yours.
[12:48:28] <z1haze> just using all available resources
[12:48:39] <robertmaxrees> in a way that's disrespectful to other people :)
[12:48:43] <robertmaxrees> that's my entire point.
[12:48:45] <z1haze> hmm
[12:48:56] <z1haze> i guess i don't see it
[12:49:07] <z1haze> either way, not intended
[12:49:28] <robertmaxrees> that's why i'm letting you know :) no biggie.
[12:49:43] <z1haze> well, anyway sorry
[12:49:49] <z1haze> can you help?
[12:50:01] <robertmaxrees> not really the right channel, but what's the question?
[12:50:27] <z1haze> using require() on a package is breaking jquery
[12:50:30] <z1haze> is goes undefined
[12:50:39] <z1haze> no other way i can explain it
[12:50:41] <robertmaxrees> using require with jquery is generally ill-advised.
[12:51:03] <z1haze> how do i get them in my main file then
[12:51:24] <robertmaxrees> you usually have to set up a shim that injects jquery for the plugin.
[12:51:31] <z1haze> i already have
[12:51:32] <robertmaxrees> or just load jquery globally.
[12:51:37] <z1haze> did that too
[12:51:44] <robertmaxrees> then dunno how to help.
[12:51:45] <robertmaxrees> sorry!
[12:51:52] <shoky_> show your code z1haze..
[12:51:58] <z1haze> sure
[12:52:01] <robertmaxrees> nah no need ;)
[12:52:14] <robertmaxrees> he just wants us to divine the answer - there's no other way he can explain the issue ;)
[12:52:49] <z1haze> http://dpaste.com/1E1B1XE
[12:53:00] <z1haze> thats not cool
[12:53:19] <z1haze> this example was my first attempt
[12:53:46] <shoky_> uh no idae about browserify-shim, sry
[12:53:48] <shoky_> idea
[12:54:13] <z1haze> then i tried window.$ = window.jQuery = require('jquery');
[12:54:28] <z1haze> making it global but its still undefined, thats what i dont understand
[12:54:42] <robertmaxrees> what's the actual error you're getting?
[12:54:52] <z1haze> jquery is undefined.
[12:55:39] <robertmaxrees> window.jquery = require('jquery');
[12:56:29] <robertmaxrees> try swapping all the jQuery instances with jquery - i'd wonder if that fixes it.
[12:56:44] <z1haze> am not just adding another var
[12:56:47] <shoky_> where are you getting the error
[12:57:14] <robertmaxrees> *sigh* the error you're getting is because it's looking for jquery, but you're loading it with jQuery
[12:57:20] <robertmaxrees> so give that a shot.
[12:57:44] <z1haze> guess not, same error and it error happens on
[12:58:03] <z1haze> line 1 of my browserified file
[12:58:07] <robertmaxrees> http://requirejs.org/docs/jquery.html check this out then.
[12:58:33] <z1haze> error is here http://dpaste.com/2R8KHAY
[12:58:42] <z1haze> literally first line in file after its all compiled
[12:58:43] <robertmaxrees> that's not helpful.
[12:58:53] <z1haze> he asked where i was getting the error.
[13:00:12] <z1haze> but see the thing is: is i comment out var gridster = require('gridster'); i have no issues
[13:01:19] <z1haze> dont doiesnt seem odd?
[13:01:47] <z1haze> how could jquery be defined and then add another require and all of the sudden its undefined.. meaning its nowhere in the page.. my other jquery plugins arent working either at this point
[13:02:05] <robertmaxrees> gridster must be doing something wrong then.
[13:03:18] <z1haze> no problems when its included in the body
[13:04:37] <robertmaxrees> yeah, require and jquery is kind of a beast - there's a reason require has an entire page on their site dedicated to the subject.
[13:05:21] <z1haze> well alright, how can i not use require but still have it all in this file?
[13:05:32] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[13:05:43] <z1haze> i only want 1 js file
[13:05:46] <robertmaxrees> you load your deps in your html and then stick all your code in that file.
[13:05:52] <cwek> is there any way to check if there is any div on .pageX and .pageY position?
[13:05:53] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, learn how to use require (shrug)
[13:06:17] <robertmaxrees> cwek without enumerating over them and doing a bunch of math, no.
[13:06:34] <robertmaxrees> oh
[13:06:35] <robertmaxrees> document.elementFromPoint(x, y);
[13:06:49] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/elementFromPoint
[13:07:53] <cwek> robertmaxrees, will check that if it fit my needs
[13:08:22] <robertmaxrees> cwek it's a little specific in that it'll get the element at that point, so you may need to check if the div you wnat is a parent of that element.
[13:09:14] <cwek> wait I will make a draw what I want
[13:09:32] <robertmaxrees> lol 'kay.
[13:09:53] <cwek> It's hart to tell :D
[13:09:58] <robertmaxrees> uh
[13:10:06] <robertmaxrees> your html is what you want to loook at - not a drawing.
[13:11:18] <bango2> well there will almost certainly be some element at x,y, even if its just the body element, unless the page is too small and doesnt reach that x,y
[13:11:38] <robertmaxrees> but you want to know if a particular element is at that x, y, right?
[13:12:50] <decx> if it's about selecting just catch a bubbling click on a parent and use target
[13:12:55] <cwek> robertmaxrees, http://imgur.com/evPZ3LO , here the blue bordered element follow the cursor. On click it stays where it is (there is 30px*30px grid system) The problem is that there is no collision. I can put elements on elements. Elements are different sizes, you can have trees ect.. I'm using only html and jquery.
[13:13:31] <decx> ah for a game
[13:13:32] <decx> ok
[13:13:33] <cwek> so the thing I would need is to check if there is any div element laying on that position
[13:13:41] <decx> so your html should just be the output
[13:13:45] <robertmaxrees> you want to learn about collition detection.
[13:13:56] <decx> all the logic should happen with your data
[13:14:02] <decx> you know where everything is
[13:14:58] <cwek> so I should save data about position? foo[width][height] and have true and false values?
[13:15:36] <decx> your level is should just be an array or an object
[13:15:45] <decx> and you can fill that with objects
[13:15:51] <decx> for example a house object
[13:15:56] <decx> that has specific properties
[13:16:01] <decx> like type, x,y
[13:16:04] <decx> width
[13:16:12] <decx> and so forth
[13:16:12] <cwek> I have that..
[13:16:14] <decx> forthe
[13:16:15] <cwek> I can share code, sec
[13:16:18] <decx> fort?
[13:16:28] <bango2> forth
[13:16:34] <decx> nice
[13:17:06] <decx> so when you move one game object, you dont check the div you draw, you check the other objects
[13:17:27] <decx> then it's just easy collision detection with rects
[13:17:51] <decx> return !((thing.x + thing.w) < rect.x || thing.x > (rect.x + rect.w) || (thing.y + thing.h) < (rect.y) || thing.y > (rect.y + rect.h))
[13:18:18] <decx> returns true if thing intersects rect
[13:18:50] <cwek> https://fiddle.jshell.net/9yedfxxf/
[13:20:03] <decx> that's neat
[13:22:11] <decx> haha the undo is a great idea
[13:22:15] <cwek> :D
[13:23:10] <decx> so you dont want roads on houses for example
[13:23:22] <cwek> yea
[13:23:46] <decx> ok so you do need to keep track of your level state
[13:24:03] <decx> otherwise you have to loop through you divs all the time
[13:24:09] <decx> which works but, ... eh
[13:24:37] <cwek> yea, i thought i'd have to use 2d array
[13:27:10] <decx> yeah but that's a whole lotta rewrite
[13:27:15] <decx> let's stick to the logic with the divs for now
[13:27:19] <decx> ;)
[13:27:32] <decx> ok before you do your click you do the check
[13:28:13] <decx> so a line above counter, run through your grid children, check their sizes and offsets and return if you can or cant continue the function
[14:36:50] <diegoviola> I'm using some Crittercism javascript library, when I bump my jquery to 2.2 Crittercism stops working and I get tons of errors
[14:36:54] <diegoviola> what could that possibly mean?
[14:37:09] <robertmaxrees> crittercism uses deprecated methods.
[14:37:28] <z1haze> so ive made some progress.. ive got jquery required with no errors and working, and ive even got this lib required in and no jquery errors.. but when i try to use the function gridster() i get undefined. what could causse this?
[14:38:34] <robertmaxrees> diegoviola their site uses jq 1.7 for their examples.  yeesh
[14:38:59] <diegoviola> robertmaxrees: I mean, the problem is actually when I update the version of Crittercism
[14:39:10] <robertmaxrees> diegoviola erm, huh?
[14:39:25] <robertmaxrees> z1haze do a console.log($.fn.gridster) - what do you get?
[14:39:30] <robertmaxrees> or whatever var you've got jquery in
[14:39:44] <robertmaxrees> diegoviola what kinds of errors are you getting?
[14:39:58] <z1haze> undefined
[14:40:16] <robertmaxrees> z1haze but console.log($.fn) returns something?
[14:40:23] <z1haze> yep
[14:40:38] <robertmaxrees> what about window.$.fn.gridster ?
[14:40:51] <z1haze> undefined
[14:41:04] <robertmaxrees> weird.  sounds like gridster isn't properly initializing.
[14:41:41] <z1haze> yea :\
[14:41:59] <z1haze> this time im working directly with a package too
[14:42:06] <robertmaxrees> https://gist.github.com/marceloemanoel/5be3a550f1e7ad45fa3f
[14:42:15] <robertmaxrees> maybe this helps?
[14:42:40] <z1haze> What is this?
[14:42:59] <robertmaxrees> the first result i got when i went to google and searched gridster requirejs
[14:43:06] <z1haze> i dont use requirejs
[14:43:18] <diegoviola> 2016-03-03 16:42:36 [ERROR] TradingApi Error: Unable to contact the server. Call: GetUser. Error: undefined
[14:43:24] <diegoviola> 2016-03-03 16:42:36 [ERROR] AddressBookApi Error: Unable to contact the server. Call: getAddresses. Error: undefined
[14:43:30] <z1haze> i never said i did. i use browserify
[14:43:30] <diegoviola> 2016-03-03 16:42:36 [ERROR] ShoppingApi Error: Unable to contact the server. Call: GetUserProfile. Error: undefined
[14:43:43] <diegoviola> I'm getting a lot of undefined errors
[14:43:56] <robertmaxrees> diegoviola sounds like you need to head to crittercism then.
[14:44:02] <robertmaxrees> their FAQ shjould help.
[14:44:29] <robertmaxrees> z1haze what version of jquery are you using btw?
[14:45:09] <z1haze> 2.2.0
[14:45:24] <robertmaxrees> z1haze also, https://github.com/substack/node-browserify/issues/868 i'd check this out.
[14:45:40] <z1haze> jquery IS defined.. lol
[14:45:41] <robertmaxrees> you might need to use something like browserify-shim?  dunno./
[14:45:59] <robertmaxrees> right, but there's relevant info in there about plugins, too.
[14:46:20] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, i might head to #browserify and see what sort of help they can give you there :)
[14:46:31] <z1haze> yea
[14:46:37] <z1haze> ive been in there since last night, not one word said lol
[14:46:50] <z1haze> not even exaggerating
[14:46:51] <robertmaxrees> dunno then, duder.
[14:46:58] <robertmaxrees> since this isn't really a browserify channel it's hard to help.
[14:49:23] <z1haze> what do you use ?
[14:49:51] <robertmaxrees> require, but we globally include some things.
[14:50:10] <robertmaxrees> but we don't go for your "one file to rule them all" pattern.
[14:54:09] <z1haze> so you jusst have a big list of http requests at the bottom of your page?
[14:54:13] <z1haze> i figured thats frowned upon
[14:54:24] <robertmaxrees> not necessarilu.
[14:54:27] <robertmaxrees> we have a few separate ones.
[14:54:43] <robertmaxrees> and they're at different points in the page.
[14:54:48] <robertmaxrees> and unless you're bundling things server-side, you're getting that now anyway.
[14:56:06] <z1haze> :( im just at a complete loss on this, i have no clue how in the heck to to make this include properly.. i mean i got it to have no errors now on page load and jquery is there, working, i used require to include this lib just as normal, but its acting like its not there
[14:56:47] <robertmaxrees> you probably need a shim since it may not be compatible with what browserify's looking for.
[14:56:54] <robertmaxrees> just out of curiosity, why are you doing this?
[14:57:06] <robertmaxrees> like, is this just for jquery and a plugin?
[14:58:51] <z1haze> well its for my whole app but its what im working on now
[14:59:03] <z1haze> im building a dashboard with movable panels, etc
[14:59:16] <robertmaxrees> okay.  so then you probably need a shim for plugins.
[14:59:19] <robertmaxrees> look into that.
[14:59:37] <z1haze> i have browserify-shim its justh ard to understand
[14:59:43] <robertmaxrees> then learn it :)
[14:59:50] <z1haze> but more of what i think is like you said, its not initializing properly
[15:00:07] <z1haze> well i have the tooltipster library working.. and its not an npm package but it works just fine
[15:00:18] <robertmaxrees> because it may expose a module correctly.
[15:00:23] <robertmaxrees> or being doing something else strange.
[15:00:51] <z1haze> will you look at it? just a glance!
[15:01:00] <robertmaxrees> i don't really have time to.
[15:01:32] <z1haze> dang ok
[15:02:34] <z1haze> well how about just the reutrn part
[15:02:39] <robertmaxrees> ...
[15:02:45] <z1haze> the jquery adapter
[15:02:54] <z1haze> http://dpaste.com/0GXVJDH
[15:03:00] <z1haze> this is at the end of the file
[15:03:21] <robertmaxrees> no clue duder.
[15:04:01] <z1haze> :(
[15:04:54] <Ou42> i have a css q... anybody got a moment?
[15:05:07] <z1haze> #css
[15:05:09] <robertmaxrees> did you chekc in #css first?
[15:05:14] <Ou42> yes
[15:05:15] <Ou42> ;)
[15:05:16] <robertmaxrees> :)
[15:05:18] <Ou42> they are all asleep
[15:05:23] <robertmaxrees> feel free to ask - no promises.
[15:05:40] <Ou42> for "fun" & "learning" I'm trying to make a ul look better. Initially the ul was centered and it'd wrap whenever. So far I've been able to left-justify it, but when adding the <br> tag it doesn't align with the text, but the bullet. How to get it to align with the text?
[15:05:48] <robertmaxrees> make a fiddle.
[15:06:07] <Ou42> is it OK to make a fiddle of someone else's table?
[15:06:12] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[15:06:20] <robertmaxrees> is it relevant to the code you're working on?
[15:06:43] <Ou42> rm: was the fiddle comment to me or z?
[15:06:50] <z1haze> you
[15:06:51] <robertmaxrees> you.
[15:07:16] <Ou42> ah. hold on a sec. just got a reply in #css
[15:09:18] <Ou42> not my fiddle, but here it is
[15:09:28] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[15:09:34] <robertmaxrees> kay.
[15:09:42] <Ou42> http://jsfiddle.net/vF5HF/337/
[15:10:25] <Ou42> if you see, the "wrapped" text doesn't align with the text after the bullet. in yahoo mail, ctrl+enter will wrap and keep the text "assigned" to that bullet and align correctly, what gives with this?
[15:11:19] <taplar> yahoo mail is probably using a wysiwyg editor
[15:12:55] <Ou42> funny u should mention that... i did come across a WI uni page that used such an editor... but looking at the page's source didn't enlighten me.
[15:15:01] <Ou42> http://jsfiddle.net/vF5HF/338/
[15:15:22] <Ou42> the text "Test1a" doesn't align with the test "Test1" is there a way to get them to align?
[15:15:42] <robertmaxrees> Ou42 define "align".
[15:15:49] <robertmaxrees> do you want it to dispaly next to that text?
[15:15:58] <robertmaxrees> or do you mean the left-hand padding is off.
[15:16:00] <Ou42> left justified after the bullet yes
[15:16:12] <z1haze> Ou42, http://jsfiddle.net/vF5HF/339/
[15:16:26] <robertmaxrees> ^
[15:16:33] <Ou42> z you're a genius. what did u do?
[15:16:38] <robertmaxrees> look at the css.
[15:16:40] <z1haze> the changes are there lol
[15:16:41] <robertmaxrees> list-style-position
[15:16:51] <Ou42> so very humbling
[15:16:54] <z1haze> and add a margin-left if you need
[15:17:00] <Musk> is there a way to trigger the popup native dialog of a typical "<select>" without clicking it directly? Something like $('select').trigger('click');? There seems to be a way with jquery.mobile but i don't to include another lib for such a simple behavior that only happens once on the site?
[15:17:10] <Ou42> did i ever send the link to the page I'm tweaking?
[15:17:37] <robertmaxrees> Musk http://stackoverflow.com/a/19652343
[15:17:39] <z1haze> the one from the 90's?
[15:18:02] <Ou42> 1989, why?
[15:18:21] <z1haze> definitely nailed its design for the era
[15:18:36] <Ou42> http://www.coolrunning.com/engine/2/2_3/181.shtml ( scroll to 5K training )
[15:18:48] <Musk> robertmaxrees, sweet thx il try this out
[15:18:53] <z1haze> hehe
[15:18:54] <Ou42> not that i could do *better* but this is *not* my page.
[15:19:00] <z1haze> ohh
[15:19:13] <shoky> Ou42 seems the same without all that crap ;p  http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/vF5HF/341/
[15:19:18] <z1haze> yea
[15:20:21] <Ou42> shoky: not sure ( as I am a noob ) but i had to include stuff to override whatever they were doing with their table css
[15:20:24] <z1haze> Ou42, i definitely dont recommend trying to design your page based on this website
[15:21:01] <z1haze> hes using <br> in the source to fix alignment
[15:21:02] <shoky> Ou42 no idea what table you're talking about
[15:21:03] <Ou42> nah, this was for learning and for extracting the table and learning and making it more purdy so i might print it out and like looking at it while i get in shape
[15:21:27] <Ou42> couch 2 5K FTW
[15:21:48] <z1haze> i could run a 5k drunk
[15:22:17] <z1haze> alright, well im going to go be sad, see ya
[15:22:27] <Ou42> be thankful z
[15:22:42] <Ou42> as we age we make impressions on couches and such
[15:22:55] <Ou42> but tyvm
[15:23:29] <Ou42> shoky: http://www.coolrunning.com/engine/2/2_3/181.shtml scroll to the 5k training table towards the bottom. beautiful.
[15:24:54] <z1haze> if someone can convert this file to be able to work with browserify ill be grateful
[15:26:17] <shoky> ok
[15:26:33] <Ou42> OK? w/o asking "how grateful?" ;)
[15:27:09] <Ou42> so, list-style-position: inside; was the issue? how many times?! how many times is it that the first few search hits create the future problems?!
[15:35:14] <Ou42> there's still hope that as things get more complicated / different, my brain will rise to the top of the heap and I'll be helpful. :p
[15:35:49] <z1haze> so robertmaxrees a guy in ##javascript pointed something out that might help
[15:36:01] <z1haze> we logged the output of the require, and it returns the actual function and not the object..
[15:44:11] <toothe> I have a function(e) {} triggered from an on-click event. Its a <select> widget. Is there a way to find the value of the <select> value?
[15:45:12] <Uhkis> $(this).val() toothe
[15:46:48] * toothe gives that a shot...actually, I just tried something similiar.
[15:47:38] <toothe> no, that's still zero.
[15:47:40] <toothe> blank*
[15:47:46] <robertmaxrees> are you bound to the select?
[15:47:49] <robertmaxrees> and use the change event.
[15:47:50] <robertmaxrees> not click.
[15:48:25] <toothe> ohhh. I know why. My <select> is within a <div> tag.
[15:48:27] <toothe> I need to redo this.
[15:48:47] <toothe> which would be $(this).find('select').val(), right?
[15:48:58] <robertmaxrees> use a change event.
[15:49:10] <toothe> pardon?
[15:49:24] <z1haze> robertmaxrees, did you see what i said? does that shed any light on a solution?
[15:49:38] <toothe> that works, awesome!
[15:49:43] <robertmaxrees> z1haze sorry, i don't know how to help you man.
[15:49:45] <robertmaxrees> sorry.
[15:49:57] <robertmaxrees> toothe you want the change event for selects and things like that.
[15:50:02] <robertmaxrees> not clicks :)
[15:50:14] <robertmaxrees> bbiab lunch
[15:50:22] <z1haze> if the require returns the function?
[15:50:28] <z1haze> but we need the object?
[15:50:43] <toothe> isn't that what I have?
[15:50:55] <toothe> object.on('change'...)
[15:59:24] <Ou42> gots to go. thanks again for all the fish. peace & 42
[16:07:58] <mchu> hi guys, need some help w/ jquery. anyone available?
[16:08:39] <taplar> shoot the q
[16:09:28] <Zzaichik> ^ means, ask your question
[16:09:44] <taplar> no, seriously.  fuck q's
[16:09:51] <Uhkis> :D
[16:09:57] <Zzaichik> ask your freakin question! Just kidding. But ask your question(s)
[16:10:01] <Zzaichik> Like, in general?
[16:10:06] <mchu> i’m receiving the response.message here, but I’d like to add a class or id to it. how do i do that? https://jsfiddle.net/0w1trmeg/
[16:10:09] <mchu> haha sorry guys.
[16:10:13] <mchu> was looking at something
[16:10:17] <Zzaichik> how dare you
[16:10:31] <Uhkis> taplar: i'm gonna go ahead and say that was your best joke so far
[16:10:31] <mchu> :(
[16:10:44] * taplar takes a bow
[16:11:35] <taplar> mchu: what are you wanting to add a id/class it?
[16:11:44] <taplar> it=to
[16:11:52] <mchu> so i get the error message back, but i’d like to add some css to it
[16:12:08] <Uhkis> mchu: there's addClass for adding classes and you can use attr to put an id to it
[16:12:13] <taplar> you realize your setting it with text() so there isn't anything to set a class/id to right?
[16:12:15] <mchu> so id like to add a class or div or anything to it to fix it up a little
[16:12:40] <mchu> taplar: then how do i go about it
[16:12:42] <taplar> unless you want to do so to the element you set the text on
[16:12:44] <Uhkis> well, if you set the id, you'll lose that original one
[16:13:05] <mchu> #uservalus is just a form
[16:13:27] <taplar> is the message html elements your wanting to put in the form?
[16:13:39] <mchu> what do you mean?
[16:13:51] <mchu> it’s just a string
[16:14:10] <taplar> i'm unclear what your wanting to put an id/class on.  the #user-values object or a part of the message
[16:14:30] <mchu> i want to put a class on the message
[16:14:48] <mchu> or div or id
[16:14:55] <taplar> so instead of setting it with text() set it with html() and then you can find one of the new children and manipulate it
[16:19:36] <mchu> hmm i think im approaching it wrong.
[16:20:11] <taplar> are you doing it slowly with your hand out palm up?
[16:21:09] <mchu> so user-values is actually just for the text.
[16:22:09] <taplar> can't put a class on text, :)
[16:22:21] <mchu> so user-values is an empty id with nothing in it. but when the code runs i’m using .html to add it to that class
[16:22:25] <Uhkis> yeah, text isn't classy at all!
[16:22:33] <mchu> ok i changed the text to html
[16:22:34] <taplar> nice
[16:22:48] <mchu> so now… the response.message should have the id#user-values right?
[16:22:58] <taplar> no
[16:23:05] <taplar> the parent has that id
[16:23:49] <taplar> your selecting the element with the id 'user-values' and setting the text inbetween the <></> as the text
[16:24:04] <taplar> logically, when really your inserting a child text node
[16:25:20] <mchu> hmm
[16:26:20] <mchu> ok the parent has that id
[16:26:27] <mchu> now how do i give that html an id
[16:26:45] <mchu> .children(“user-values”).attr ??
[16:27:03] <taplar> $('#user-values').find('someChildSelector').prop('id/class', 'value')
[16:27:17] <taplar> actually id in that case
[16:27:23] <taplar> class would be addClass('value')
[16:30:38] <mchu> having some difficulty w/ this somechildselector thing
[16:30:47] <mchu> so the parent is user-values correct?
[16:30:52] <taplar> yep
[16:31:28] <mchu> so what belongs there. should be (‘#user-values > _____) ?
[16:31:40] <taplar> you can use > if you want, sure
[16:31:48] <mchu> so what belongs in the underline?
[16:31:55] <taplar> whatever you want to change
[16:32:01] <mchu> like...
[16:32:06] <taplar> i dunno what your html looks like
[16:32:06] <mchu> response.message?
[16:32:19] <taplar> a tag or class or id in that message
[16:32:55] <mchu> i inspected that part. theres no class or id in it
[16:33:04] <taplar> so a tag then
[16:33:37] <mchu> <div id="error-message" class="text-center">Invalid Zip, City and State Combination. Please check your entry and try again.</div>
[16:33:41] <mchu> thats whats there. no tag either.
[16:33:48] <taplar> div is a tag
[16:33:51] <mchu> ok
[16:34:08] <taplar> and it has an id already, :|
[16:34:21] <mchu> woops
[16:34:23] <mchu> i changed user-values to that
[16:34:29] <mchu> i just wanted to stay consistent here
[16:34:38] <mchu> so repalce user-value w/ error-message
[16:34:43] <mchu> or the other way around
[16:34:52] <taplar> ok, so inside your element is just text?
[16:35:09] <mchu> yeah, and i changed it to .html (instead of .text)
[16:35:16] <taplar> yeah, you can't put an id/class on that
[16:35:30] <taplar> separately from the parent element
[16:35:46] <taplar> you'd have to surround it with a span or something, in which case i'd question why your doing that
[16:39:52] <mchu> surround it w/ span in the html page right?
[16:39:59] <mchu> the issue is.. im using Jade… and jade is so confusing
[16:40:19] <taplar> what are you trying to accomplish?  you have a div with an id and class on it that contains just text.  what is the purpose of the change you are trying to do?
[16:40:49] <mchu> trying to add some css to it lol
[16:40:58] <mchu> css to the message
[16:41:04] <taplar> all of it, part of it?
[16:41:11] <mchu> let me update my jsfiddle
[16:41:57] <taplar> cause if your wanting to style the whole thing then you can either add your styling to the rule(s) for #user-values or create a new rule with a new class and add that class to that element
[16:42:32] <mchu> yes i tried styling the whole thing with user-values
[16:42:36] <mchu> but it didnt work
[16:44:30] <taplar> throw in the fiddle what you tried that didn't work
[16:45:10] <Ackis> I'm having a bit of trouble with defers/promises - http://pastebin.com/i3WRGwWk - I want a function called after everything with query is finished
[16:46:12] <robertmaxrees> Ackis you need to create an array of promises and use $.when() against that.
[16:46:44] <Ackis> $.when.apply(null, promises).done() ?
[16:46:59] <robertmaxrees> $.when.apply($, promises).then() yeah.
[16:47:03] <robertmaxrees> but you still need your array.
[16:47:39] <Ackis> what I'm not sure about is what item gets added to the array - I've used promises like that for ajax calls within ajax calls
[16:47:48] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[16:47:51] <robertmaxrees> the promises do.
[16:49:49] <robertmaxrees> https://bpaste.net/show/97d4875429bf something like this.
[16:49:56] <robertmaxrees> might not work out of the box, but you get the idea.
[16:50:20] <robertmaxrees> though you're going to have problems with your vars and scope at that point.
[16:50:32] <Ackis> ahh okay - yeah thank you - I kept on trying trying to do the promises within the .each()
[16:50:38] <robertmaxrees> yeah you can't.
[16:50:39] <Ackis> what you did makes sense
[16:54:53] <mchu> taplar: https://jsfiddle.net/p5geqv7s/
[16:55:43] <taplar> i thought you said you changed the id to user-values ?
[16:59:00] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/p5geqv7s/1/
[17:00:28] <mchu> it was originally user-value. but then half way tlaking to you i changed it to error-message so its more specific. but i left it as user-values with you
[17:00:36] <mchu> but lets change it to what i have now
[17:00:52] <mchu> taplar: anyways, the css isnt working on that error-message
[17:01:01] <taplar> looked red to me
[17:01:28] <mchu> taplar: oh its not red because of the css
[17:01:36] <mchu> its red because of some formatting issue i think or idk
[17:01:44] <taplar> in that fiddle i shared?
[17:01:55] <mchu> taplar: yeah i can remove the css and its still red in the background
[17:02:44] <mchu> so.. how do i make the response.message red
[17:02:53] <mchu> and add a bunch of css to it
[17:03:00] <taplar> i just showed you ?
[17:05:00] <mchu> it did not workkk :(
[17:05:19] <taplar> on your site?
[17:08:18] <mchu> yup
[17:08:39] <mchu> can u edit it on the jsfiddle
[17:08:57] <mchu> error-message isnt catching the .html response message
[17:09:03] <taplar> so right click on the element and inspect it.  make sure it has the id/classes you expect it to and you can also click it and see on the rhs the css that is affecting it
[17:09:39] <mchu> yes… i think this is right. <div id="error-message" class="text-center">Invalid Zip, City and State Combination. Please check your entry and try again.</div>
[17:09:50] <mchu> only issue w/ that is the class=“text center"
[17:10:24] <mchu> it shows that the message has the id”error message” . so if i give it color in my css it should work right?
[17:10:44] <taplar> yes
[17:13:08] <mchu> but it doesnt lawl
[17:13:17] <mchu> even w/ the code i have in the jsfiddle
[17:13:26] <taplar> what code do you have?
[17:13:45] <mchu> https://jsfiddle.net/p5geqv7s/3/
[17:14:05] <robertmaxrees> that's now how you use ajax.
[17:14:07] <robertmaxrees> open your console duder.
[17:14:19] <mchu> robertmaxrees: oh its a shorter version of it
[17:14:20] <mchu> ok
[17:14:31] <robertmaxrees> then show us the real code.
[17:14:35] <robertmaxrees> because what you have there isn't valid.
[17:14:41] <taplar> ^^^
[17:14:49] <mchu> https://jsfiddle.net/p5geqv7s/4/
[17:15:22] <mchu> u could probably remove line 25, i was messing with that to make it work
[17:15:42] <robertmaxrees> what's with the #error-message.text-center at the top?
[17:16:02] <mchu> so both of those are in the same file.
[17:16:04] <mchu> its a .jade file
[17:16:09] <robertmaxrees> also, you need to add css to make that color work.
[17:16:24] <mchu> i added the css in the style.css page
[17:16:36] <mchu> just a simple test like
[17:16:39] <robertmaxrees> any console errors or anything?
[17:16:46] <mchu> #error-message { color: red’ }
[17:16:48] <mchu> nope
[17:17:02] <robertmaxrees> are you sure you're getting to the success call?
[17:17:19] <taplar> red' ?
[17:17:20] <mchu> yup
[17:17:26] <mchu> the message is appearing
[17:17:36] <mchu> i just want to add styling to it
[17:17:46] <robertmaxrees> and you're not repeating IDs or anything like that?
[17:17:47] <taplar> did you typo that single quote?
[17:17:52] <robertmaxrees> like, we're flying totally blind here sooo
[17:17:53] <mchu> nope not repeating
[17:20:34] <mchu> can i insert the response.message into a <p> ?
[17:20:39] <mchu> would that make it work
[17:20:55] <mchu> then do css styling on the #error-message p { }
[17:21:01] <robertmaxrees> #error-message.text-center { color: "red" }; should work.
[17:21:09] <mchu> ok let me try that now
[17:21:40] <mchu> hmm color is not changing
[17:21:50] <mchu> ok how about i include some of the other html around that part of the code.
[17:21:57] <robertmaxrees> what about  #error-message { color: "red" };
[17:21:59] <taplar> right click on your element and make sure it has that id
[17:22:03] <robertmaxrees> ^^^
[17:22:14] <robertmaxrees> your selector is either bad, or you have something overriding that style.
[17:22:16] <robertmaxrees> #css101
[17:24:08] <mchu> https://jsfiddle.net/p5geqv7s/5/
[17:24:27] <taplar> html dude
[17:24:28] <robertmaxrees> so js doesn't know anything about jade.
[17:24:33] <robertmaxrees> you have HTML - that's wha twe need to see.
[17:24:38] <taplar> copy the html that is rendered and put that in the fiddle
[17:24:40] <taplar> :|
[17:24:48] <mchu> this is the inspect part.
[17:24:49] <mchu> <div id="error-message" class="text-center">Invalid Zip, City and State Combination. Please check your entry and try again.</div>
[17:25:00] <taplar> what's it's parent?
[17:26:10] <taplar> put that part in the html area of the fiddle
[17:29:10] <mchu> idk how to switch to html in fiddle
[17:29:12] <mchu> its not showing the box
[17:29:16] <mchu> only css and js for some reason
[17:29:16] <robertmaxrees> uh
[17:29:19] <robertmaxrees> in your site dude.
[17:29:23] <robertmaxrees> wait what?
[17:29:28] <robertmaxrees> you should be seeing 4 panels.
[17:29:32] <mchu> i dont
[17:29:37] <mchu> i used to… idk what happened lol
[17:29:38] <robertmaxrees> O.o what browser are you using
[17:29:39] <robertmaxrees> ?
[17:29:42] <mchu> chrome
[17:30:05] <mchu> yup only css and js… idk what changed
[17:30:05] <noregret> im appending to a textarea, how can i make it auto scroll to the latest?
[17:30:19] <taplar> the html box is the one that you put the #top #logo.text-area text
[17:30:33] <taplar> it has "html" in the top right corner of it
[17:33:07] <mchu> theres only 2 boxes lol. css and js for me
[17:33:41] <taplar> start a new fiddle, weird
[17:34:17] <mchu> i did. ok got it. its all the way on the right.. its hidden but i cant grab it lol
[17:34:50] <mchu> mind making a js fiddle w/ html in it so i can see it
[17:34:54] <mchu> maybe itll reset my js fiddle
[17:35:03] <robertmaxrees> wut
[17:35:17] <robertmaxrees> uh, you jacked something up bigtime.  clear your cookies and cache.
[17:35:21] <mchu> ok
[17:39:22] <mchu> man my jsfiddle is messed up
[17:39:33] <mchu> can you create one with html in it so i can test it?
[17:39:43] <robertmaxrees> lol
[17:39:47] <robertmaxrees> make a bin then instead.
[17:40:02] <mchu> ?
[17:40:11] <robertmaxrees> jsbin.com
[17:40:44] <mchu> o. but can u still do it please.
[17:40:48] <mchu> it can be empty.
[17:40:52] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[17:40:54] <PantsOfChocolate> hey jquery peeps, whats the best way to select and bind an element that doesnt exist, is it the document.on(click,element) way?
[17:41:16] <robertmaxrees> PantsOfChocolate use a delegated listener.
[17:41:17] <mchu> like.. create a jsfiddle.. fill something in the html section and send me the link
[17:41:28] <robertmaxrees> and bind a listener to a parent element, but not documenbt.
[17:41:34] <robertmaxrees> mchu http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/4ofzf5zg/ ?
[17:41:48] <mchu> wow lame. i still dont see css lol
[17:41:52] <robertmaxrees> right.
[17:41:52] <mchu> i mean html
[17:43:04] <mchu> got it!
[17:44:56] <robertmaxrees> cool
[17:50:16] <noregret> im appending to a textarea, how can i make it auto scroll to the latest?
[17:52:39] <robertmaxrees> set the scrolltop to the height of the textarea iirc.
[17:53:10] <PantsOfChocolate> robertmaxrees: why is jquery hard is my next question
[17:53:22] <robertmaxrees> it is?
[17:53:24] <robertmaxrees> it's pretty simple.
[17:53:49] <PantsOfChocolate> :(\
[17:54:01] <robertmaxrees> uh, what are you having problems with?
[17:54:11] <arc_> certainly easier than doing everything yourself in javascript
[17:54:18] <robertmaxrees> it's a simplified API for the DOM.  pretty easy to use.
[17:54:19] <arc_> "vanilla javascript"
[17:54:29] <robertmaxrees> not technically javascript, just the DOM API
[17:54:35] <PantsOfChocolate> what is the difference between these two commands https://jsfiddle.net/ksas3605/
[17:54:49] <robertmaxrees> easy.
[17:55:04] <robertmaxrees> $('#map-canvas .avail_button').on('click',function(e){ binds a listener directly to $('#map-canvas .avail_button').
[17:55:24] <robertmaxrees> $('#map-canvas').on('click','.avail_button',function(e){ binds a delegated listener to #map-canvas and triggers the handler for anything that came from .avail-button
[17:55:58] <robertmaxrees> https://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events and http://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/ are good resources.
[17:56:07] <PantsOfChocolate> see whats strange, is the button that they are after is hidden, and info window pops up with a button in it, when the button is visible the top one works and thats it if i call it then
[17:56:19] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[17:56:35] <PantsOfChocolate> like if the button is visible then in the console i call the first command in the fiddle it works
[17:56:54] <PantsOfChocolate> but the second should work even if the button isnt invisible or doesnt exist yet right?
[17:57:02] <robertmaxrees> correct.
[17:57:09] <arc_> if you use the console, you're running stuff after the page has loaded
[17:57:14] <robertmaxrees> ^
[17:57:24] <robertmaxrees> $('#map-canvas') still needs to exist on pageload.
[17:57:29] <PantsOfChocolate> yea thats where i am kinda getting confused
[17:57:32] <PantsOfChocolate> ok
[17:57:42] <robertmaxrees> you need to bind to a parent that exists on pageload.
[17:57:46] <PantsOfChocolate> so once the map has loaded do that?
[17:57:49] <robertmaxrees> the two pages I linked talk about this in depth.
[17:57:51] <robertmaxrees> no.
[17:57:57] <robertmaxrees> bind to a parent aht exists on pageload.
[17:57:58] <PantsOfChocolate> ok ok i gotcha
[17:59:19] <robertmaxrees> it's made possible by a concept called bubbling, a very important thing to understand for event handling.
[18:00:07] <noregret> robertmaxrees: like this you mean , https://dpaste.de/7Pm6?
[18:00:41] <robertmaxrees> i'd use https://api.jquery.com/scrollTop/ personally.
[18:05:33] <noregret> robertmaxrees: and set it to .height() ?
[18:05:39] <robertmaxrees> something like that, yeah.
[18:05:47] <robertmaxrees> or the innerheight.
[18:05:52] <robertmaxrees> i can't remember offhand exactly.
[18:07:15] <noregret> robertmaxrees: i saw this sample somehwere http://jsfiddle.net/mya0u1zo/2/
[18:07:24] <robertmaxrees> then use it.
[18:07:26] <noregret> robertmaxrees: but it's failing in my case,
[18:07:32] <robertmaxrees> okay?
[18:07:35] <robertmaxrees> dunno what to tell you.
[18:07:37] <noregret> robertmaxrees: the textarea does not scroll
[18:07:56] <robertmaxrees> then i'd need to see your code.
[18:08:27] <noregret> robertmaxrees: it's this now https://dpaste.de/hPn8
[18:08:51] <robertmaxrees> try using the other code then?
[18:12:25] <PantsOfChocolate> robertttttttt
[18:12:35] <PantsOfChocolate> why have you helped me for yearssss i never learnnnn
[18:13:36] <robertmaxrees> hahaha
[18:13:40] <robertmaxrees> you just gotta start reading.
[18:16:03] <PantsOfChocolate> i still cant manage to get it to work
[18:16:10] <PantsOfChocolate> i surrounded the map with a div called my_div
[18:16:48] <PantsOfChocolate> then im running $('#my_div').on('click','.avail_button.function(){}); doesnt work for me
[18:16:53] <PantsOfChocolate> im just trying to do an alert
[18:16:54] <robertmaxrees> is your code in a document ready?
[18:18:13] <PantsOfChocolate> no should it be?
[18:18:26] <PantsOfChocolate> but even when i run it from console in chrome it doesnt work
[18:20:10] <robertmaxrees> do $('#my_div').length in your console
[18:20:13] <robertmaxrees> what do you get?
[18:20:29] <PantsOfChocolate> 1
[18:20:51] <robertmaxrees> and $('#my_div').find('.avail_button').length
[18:21:31] <PantsOfChocolate> always 0
[18:21:38] <robertmaxrees> then that's your problem.
[18:21:42] <PantsOfChocolate> even if it isnt on the page or is clearly on the page haha
[18:21:43] <robertmaxrees> that element doesn't exist.
[18:21:54] <PantsOfChocolate> oh wait i lied
[18:22:02] <PantsOfChocolate> if its not there its 0
[18:22:12] <PantsOfChocolate> but if an item is selected and the infobubble is up its 1
[18:22:35] <robertmaxrees> there's a chance then that something is stopping the event from bubbling.
[18:22:47] <PantsOfChocolate> i mean its on a map
[18:22:53] <PantsOfChocolate> googles map and panel
[18:22:58] <robertmaxrees> that... doesn't mean anything fwiw.
[18:23:03] <PantsOfChocolate> i assume its being blocked by everything
[18:23:09] <PantsOfChocolate> EVERYTHING IT MEANS EVERYTHING ROBERT
[18:23:12] <PantsOfChocolate> GOOGLE IS EVIL
[18:23:15] <robertmaxrees> wat
[18:23:18] <PantsOfChocolate> BLOCKING MY CODE
[18:23:22] <robertmaxrees> see if they offer callbacks.
[18:23:58] <PantsOfChocolate> kk
[18:39:51] <PantsOfChocolate> robertmaxrees: so they have an event.addlistener but again i think its being called before the html is there, is there a way to do addlistener to once its visible? or once its fully loaded?
[18:40:02] <robertmaxrees> who has that?
[18:40:13] <PantsOfChocolate> google
[18:40:24] <PantsOfChocolate> google.maps.event.addListener
[18:40:33] <robertmaxrees> i have no idea duder.
[18:40:45] <robertmaxrees> that probably exists when the m ap exists.
[18:40:51] <PantsOfChocolate> well the current command its running on is 'domready;
[18:41:04] <robertmaxrees> is there a callback from when the map loads?
[18:44:09] <robertmaxrees> https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/3.exp/reference this has a bunch of events that get emitted.  might be a good idea to reference this.
[18:44:20] <PantsOfChocolate> im doing a callback from when infobubble pops up
[18:44:32] <PantsOfChocolate> i found that when digging around when you mentioned callbacks
[18:45:25] <PantsOfChocolate> i need something like a little after the domready event i feel
[18:45:31] <robertmaxrees> probably not.
[18:45:37] <robertmaxrees> use the API google maps gives you.
[18:45:45] <robertmaxrees> also: how are you detecting dom ready?
[18:46:32] <PantsOfChocolate> thats what i am doing
[18:46:38] <PantsOfChocolate> google.maps.event.addListener(infoBubble, 'domready', function() {
[18:53:59] <PantsOfChocolate> which apparently finishes too early
[18:55:07] <robertmaxrees> that has nothing to do with the document being ready.
[18:55:26] <robertmaxrees> the "class" just needs to be initialized.
[18:55:42] <robertmaxrees> google.map points to the name of your instance, right?
[18:55:42] <PantsOfChocolate> ah gotcha
[18:55:47] <PantsOfChocolate> yea
[19:20:18] <robertmaxrees> one of these days, i will get my hands on an early 60's strat.
[19:30:56] <acidjazz> stratosphere?
[19:31:12] <robertmaxrees> sure why not.
[19:31:12] <acidjazz> stratocaster i assume
[19:31:16] <robertmaxrees> yeah.
[19:32:11] <acidjazz> the series or one actually made in the 60s
[19:32:21] <robertmaxrees> one actually made in the 60's.
[19:32:30] <acidjazz> i assume by early you mean a real 50yr old strat
[19:32:35] <robertmaxrees> a real, pre-CBS strat.
[20:46:17] <Newtonianb> need some assistance I'm lost debugging inside of jquery internals. I'm using $.ajaxPrefilter to (encrypt) an ajax body to the server. That works fine now the server returns and I'm using $.ajaxSetup dataFilter to decrypt it. That's when things go awry. It seems even before dataFilter gets called it does some kind of processing on the content of the initial ajax to figure out something called
[20:46:17] <Newtonianb> dataType. In my case my dataTypes array has a funky elements dataTypes = ["text", "my encrypted body", "json"], that "my encrypted body" is scewing up everything.
[20:52:45] <taplar> have you tried processData: false
[20:54:11] <Newtonianb> I have not thank you let me see
[21:00:22] <Newtonianb> Actually it's already done it seems, I'm using backbone to do the ajax thruogh a model so I see the sync method has     // Don't process data on a non-GET request.
[21:00:22] <Newtonianb> if (params.type !== 'GET' && !options.emulateJSON) { params.processData = false; }
[21:06:21] <sonnie> Hi everyone. I have 2 events with same function. For example: $('#id1').click(function() { blabla }); $('#id2').click(function() { blabla });  How can I optimize the codes?
[21:06:21] <Newtonianb> The problem I see is dataTypes is already poluted within the done() method http://grab.by/OAbc
[21:12:13] <taplar> sonnie: store the callback in a method and pass that in
[21:14:30] <taplar> Newtonianb: try setting contentType: false
[21:16:14] <Newtonianb> ok
[21:47:09] <Steedle> i am using the jquery datepicker, im using minDate on local to prevent previous dates in from today from being able to be selected, but when i move it to production minDate dont work, any quick ideas ?
[21:47:43] <taplar> are you preventing the user from typing the date manually?
[21:49:37] <Steedle> you are not able to enter manually, correct
[21:49:45] <Steedle> uses the calendar to choose the date
[21:50:43] <taplar> how are you setting the minDate?
[21:52:50] <Steedle> http://pastebin.com/JR5ek4rK
[21:53:17] <Steedle> this works on local version of the exact copy of the website
[21:53:34] <taplar> so you setting it to be 0 which is the same day
[21:53:46] <taplar> which would rely on the date being correct on the local machine the user is on
[21:53:59] <taplar> afaik with the datepicker
[21:56:23] <taplar> might be more accurate to set it with the specific date from the server or something.  however, even if that works, you still need validation on your backend to validate that
[22:07:57] <Steedle> ok will look into that, thanks
