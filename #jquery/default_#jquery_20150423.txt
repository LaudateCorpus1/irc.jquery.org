[00:22:23] <sinorai> hi guys.. how do i add a style to a html markup, using jquery. like add the css style into the html markup ??
[00:24:12] <javascript501> Hi everyone ; I'm trying to make droppable all the elments EXCEPT one, which ID is top_axis :
[00:24:15] <javascript501> $(':not(#top_axis)').droppable
[00:24:19] <jim_at_jibba> $().css()
[00:24:35] <javascript501> but top_axis IS droppable too, and I don't know why :-
[00:24:36] <jim_at_jibba> sinorai that was meant for yo
[00:25:09] <javascript501> (droppable is a jquery UI's function)
[00:26:16] <sinorai> ok thanks.. i will try that..
[00:26:40] <javascript501> Nobody can help me ? :-)
[00:27:29] <Uhkis> javascript501: $('select all elements').not('#top_axis').droppable should do the trick
[00:27:38] <oojacoboo> what's the property value of the jQuery data attr (data store) in the shadow dom?
[00:28:45] <javascript501> Uhkis: $('body').not('#top_axis').droppable( ?
[00:28:49] <javascript501> it's not working too :-(
[00:29:32] <Uhkis> well you didn't select all the elements
[00:29:42] <javascript501> Idem if I write $('*')
[00:31:17] <javascript501> It's so weird
[00:42:39] <javascript897> $('*').not('#top_axis').droppable    is not wotking : #top_axis is also droppable ; do you know why ?
[00:53:59] <Cork> javascript897: cause you grab every element in the page
[00:54:11] <Cork> javascript897: including the parent of top_axis
[01:14:20] <bepolite> javascript897: fiddle?
[01:14:36] <sinorai> is this correct?? $('TESTCLASS').css('background', 'red');
[01:16:31] <bepolite> sinorai: depends on what you want to acomplish
[01:16:36] <bepolite> but the syntax is correct
[01:17:11] <sinorai> i want the TESTCLASS to have the css properties of .TESTCLASS { background:red;}
[01:17:20] <Cork> sinorai: you need the dot
[01:17:49] <Cork> sinorai: also note .css doesn't modify the stylesheet
[01:17:59] <Cork> sinorai: it just adds the css to the elements matched by the selector
[01:19:20] <sinorai> dot where and how ?
[01:19:34] <Cork> the jquery selector
[01:19:47] <Cork> $('') takes the same kind of selector you write in css
[01:20:15] <sinorai> ahh so i should chagne it to $('.TESTCLASS').css('background', 'red');

[01:26:06] <azlol3> hi i have a problem gettingtext of a select2, can someone helps me , here 's my problem :http://laravel.io/bin/RE628
[01:45:01] <Uhkis> azlol3: what are you actually trying to get
[01:45:35] <azlol3> i want the text selected
[01:45:39] <azlol3> not the id
[01:45:58] <azlol3> i need text for another select2 chained
[01:47:26] <Uhkis>  $("#serieinputdashboard").val() not working?
[01:48:33] <azlol3> it works but it gives me the id
[01:49:13] <azlol3> text() works lol , so weird
[01:49:28] <azlol3> i tried 20 times and now it works..
[01:49:49] <Uhkis> .text is a property, .text() is a function
[01:50:34] <azlol3> .text gives me undefined
[02:02:17] <azlol3> nobody has an idea?
[02:02:50] <azlol3> its not the right way to use text() to get text of option selected on a select2 inpu
[02:02:53] <azlol3> t
[02:15:11] <drzed> i created a function that fetches a json file; how do exectute this function every few seconds?
[02:15:19] <toomus> Hi all. Check my js fiddle: https://jsfiddle.net/z70jww3w/
[02:15:22] <drzed> i tried the following: http://pastebin.com/7AG1h6yg
[02:15:48] <drzed> however this does only execute once (when the page is loaded)
[02:16:02] <toomus> How to return BOX2?
[02:16:24] <drzed> why does it not execute $().myfunction another time?
[02:21:55] <toomus> Any ideas?
[02:38:58] <d3m0n> Whats that jquery plugin that doesnt scroll up right away if the mouse blurs the element
[02:39:03] <d3m0n> for drop down menus
[02:49:35] <azlol3> why $("#serieinputdashboard").select2('data').text gives me nothing?
[02:51:16] <azlol3> http://laravel.io/bin/PXD33
[02:52:51] <kostodo> I'm getting this weird keyboard bar popping up when I focus on an input which pops up a jquery datepicker on IOS only
[02:52:55] <Uhkis> azlol3: make a fiddle
[02:53:14] <kostodo> the keyboard doesnt pop up but the keyboard bar (with left/right and done buttons) shows up
[02:53:20] <kostodo> Android does no such thing
[02:53:27] <kostodo> And the fields are set to readonly
[02:54:57] <Uhkis> toomus: $('div.inner-box').eq(1);
[02:56:24] <toomus> Uhkis: gr8 :)
[02:58:45] <d3m0n> azlol3: just $("#serieinputdashboard").select2('data') ?
[02:59:02] <d3m0n> wait what r u doing
[03:00:00] <d3m0n> Oh its aplugin nvm
[03:01:58] <jost_> Hi... on the jquery-ui page, where is the download button?
[03:02:27] <jost_> or the page with the information about which ui-versions are compatible to which jQuery versions??
[03:02:29] <jost_> -?
[03:03:35] <jost_> ok, sorry - was on learn.jquery.com, which really misses some links
[03:22:02] <Cork> jost_: downloads though the theme builder
[03:22:14] <Cork> jost_: alternatively you can download the full package from the cdn
[03:22:17] <jost_> Cork: yeah, found that (bower)
[03:22:33] <Cork> i was talking about http://code.jquery.com/ui/
[03:22:34] <jost_> but I needed to know which jQuery versions are supported for current jQuery ui
[03:22:34] <Cork> :)
[03:23:16] <Cork> jost_: ya, the compatibility information hasn't really been accessable for long
[03:23:26] <Cork> just added it for bower a few versions back
[03:34:39] <matthewbe> hi
[03:36:36] <matthewbe> I try to call .submit() on a form, but it has no effect. My form doesn't have an "action" attribute (so that the destionation is actually the same page).
[03:36:46] <matthewbe> Might that be the cause?
[03:37:16] <Cork> matthewbe: .submit is special there is both a .submit jquery method
[03:37:18] <Cork> and a dom method
[03:37:27] <Cork> and they don't really do the same thing
[03:37:33] <Cork> matthewbe: so... code?
[03:38:08] <matthewbe> Cork, $("#uploadFileForm").submit();
[03:38:25] <Cork> matthewbe: context
[03:38:59] <matthewbe> Cork, http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7321855/how-do-i-auto-submit-an-upload-form-when-a-file-is-selected
[03:39:05] <matthewbe> Upload a form when a file is selected
[03:39:16] <matthewbe> Second answer, using jQuery
[03:39:20] <matthewbe> I try the same
[03:39:25] <matthewbe> but submit has no effect
[03:39:37] <matthewbe> I suspect this is because I have no "action" attribute
[03:40:28] <matthewbe> Cork, PS: I'm sure the event works well as I alert a test message. The .submit() just has no effect
[03:44:00] <Uhkis> does $("#uploadFileForm")[0].submit(); work?
[03:46:02] <matthewbe> $("#uploadFileForm")[0].submit();  says "Uncaught TypeError: object is not a function".
[03:46:05] <matthewbe> Uhkis, ^
[03:46:27] <Cork> meaning $("#uploadFileForm").length == 0
[03:46:27] <matthewbe> alert($("#uploadFileForm").length);   returns 1 though :/
[03:46:35] <Cork> ah
[03:46:38] <matthewbe> Cork, see above
[03:46:53] <Cork> and $("#uploadFileForm").prop('tagName')
[03:47:32] <matthewbe> Cork, alerts "FORM"
[03:47:42] <Cork> O_o
[03:47:58] <matthewbe> Cork, I will try to put a dummy action then, 2 sec
[03:49:49] <matthewbe> Wow, even setting an "action" attirbute didn't solve it
[03:49:56] <matthewbe> Cork, <form method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data" id="uploadFileForm" action="/dummy">
[03:50:06] <matthewbe> this is the form element with its attributes
[03:50:23] <Cork> matthewbe: the problem isn't the attributes on the form
[03:50:34] <Cork> sounds like something is breaking your dom or something
[03:51:04] <Cork> cause it sounds like something has overwritten DOMElement.submit
[03:54:29] <matthewbe> Cork, I found something... but it makes me quite upset... my input submit button has "name" attribute set to "submit". I chanegd it to "subm", because I had a similar problem in the past, and now the form submits (I have another issue, but it submits)
[03:54:54] <matthewbe> Cork, it looks like I can't have <input name="submit" type="submit" ...
[03:55:00] <matthewbe> and I don't understand why
[03:55:05] <Cork> matthewbe: ya, you should avoid names of normal dom actions
[03:55:14] <matthewbe> and I had this issue 5+ years ago, still an issue today....
[03:55:25] <Cork> matthewbe: cause the form gets properties for the names in the form
[03:55:45] <Cork> <input type="text" name="a"> parentForm.a == input
[03:56:20] <Cork> this is sadly common for many places in the dom, and is a really pitfall
[03:56:28] <Cork> *real
[03:58:51] <matthewbe> Cork, http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3571328/form-submit-button-will-not-submit-when-name-of-button-is-submit
[03:59:09] <Cork> matthewbe: i'm not interested in the so community
[03:59:19] <matthewbe> Cork, why? :p
[03:59:24] <Cork> if you want to ask questions there do it, but don't as us to go there
[03:59:46] <Cork> matthewbe: do you go do the ms support and ask them to come to the chrome support forum?
[04:00:00] <Cork> pick a community and wait for them to answer
[04:00:19] <Cork> and about the why, cause so is a pile of junk
[04:02:35] <matthewbe> Cork, I just google'd the subject and found interesting to read others experience. I don't want to pick one community, I use them all together
[04:02:50] <Uhkis> "Yes, this is all Netscape's fault" :D
[04:06:47] <kostodo> How can I avoid the tab bar on iOS Safari?
[04:08:43] <matthewbe> Cork, I'm still investigating, but right now it seems that .submit() doesn't work if the form contains file data. Might have been struggling for nothing :'D
[04:09:01] <Cork> matthewbe: no that isn't true
[04:11:03] <matthewbe> Cork, if I remove the javascript, and press manually the submit button, my file gets uploaded. When I try with javascript (call .submit() on the form when file is selected), the file *doesn't* get uploaded.
[04:11:25] <matthewbe> but the form is submitted
[04:12:21] <Cork> matthewbe: triggering submit on the form for uploading a file is how iframe file uploads works
[04:12:26] <Cork> so no, that isn't the connection
[04:17:30] <Cork> matthewbe: http://jsfiddle.net/am5qq51k/
[04:17:32] <Cork> works fine here
[04:20:57] <matthewbe> Cork, I think I know the problem - the POST array is empty when I upload a file (i'm surprised that the submit button is not included in the post data but still looking). And thus server side considered this is not a POST request and doesn't do anything
[04:21:25] <matthewbe> Cork, however $_FILES has data
[04:21:36] <Cork> so the problem is server side not client side
[04:21:58] <Cork> cause ya, the submit button is only included if it is actually clicked
[04:22:29] <Cork> (and is one of the reasons why it isn't a good solution for differentiating actions)
[04:22:39] <sudomarize> How can I simulate inputting a value into an input box? I've got a component that is meant to refresh a list on each keypress event, but I want to set a value to this input when the page loads
[04:23:04] <matthewbe> Cork, yes, thank you, I thought the submit() could not include the file but you made it clear I was wrong and saved me a lot of time. Also I didn't know that the submit button is included only if you actually click on it
[04:23:15] <matthewbe> :)
[04:23:30] <Cork> never assume things when you diagnose
[04:23:39] <Cork> it is a very good way to throw away time
[04:23:44] <matthewbe> Cork, How do you differentiate actions preferably?
[04:24:08] <Cork> check boxes or ratio buttons
[04:24:28] <matthewbe> Cork, I'm careful. I always say "it seems", "it might", if you noticed. Assumptions are bad:)
[04:24:30] <Cork> basically a form shouldn't have more then one action
[04:24:44] <Cork> instead you should include additional "data"
[04:25:04] <Cork> matthewbe: ya, but seems and might means you assumed
[04:25:33] <Cork> the only difference is that you didn't state that you where sure about it
[04:25:46] <sudomarize> dw
[04:26:11] <Cork> matthewbe: what i'm trying to say basically always start from the position "the problem is in my code"
[04:26:36] <Cork> sure there is situations where that is wrong, but the majority of time that is the correct answer
[04:26:52] <sudomarize> ignore that dw, didn't work
[04:27:00] <Uhkis> unless it's IE ;-)
[04:27:20] <Cork> Uhkis: well older ie i would agree
[04:27:37] <Cork> but if you look at modern one, it is actually one of the more predictable ones
[04:27:48] <Cork> webkit/blink is actually more of a problem now days
[04:27:54] <matthewbe> Cork, this particular form actually had two actions, funny... It has an action "Upload file" (that now will be automatic with the JS script) and an action "Next step"
[04:28:12] <Cork> (i have more workarounds for broken behavior in webkit/blink then i have for ie10+)
[04:29:30] <sudomarize> anyone?
[04:29:39] <sudomarize> is this possible?
[04:30:13] <Cork> sudomarize: it is possible, unless the script actually checks if the event is fake or not
[04:30:17] <Cork> but it is a lot of work
[04:30:36] <Cork> so you prob want to avoid that if possible
[04:31:44] <sudomarize> damn...
[04:31:46] <sudomarize> ok thanks
[04:31:54] <Uhkis> what's blink?
[04:32:07] <Cork> googles fork of webkit
[04:32:27] <Cork> google forked webkit cause apple wasn't interested in fixing bugs
[04:32:38] <Cork> so yes, testing in chrome != works in safari anymore
[04:32:58] <Cork> (haven't been for over a year)
[04:33:03] <Uhkis> oh, that explains people cursing safari
[04:33:44] <Cork> ya, mobile safari is todays ie6
[04:34:07] <Cork> though to be honest webview android isn't any better
[04:34:39] <Cork> (android < 4 still have an unpatched vulnerability)
[04:35:00] <Cork> and its been known and exploited for several years now
[05:05:38] <ajf-> So can I use the jQuery source as if it were a component based package?
[05:06:33] <ajf-> e.g. define(['jquery/core','jquery/selector'], function(jQuery) { ... });
[05:34:03] <clu3> hi all, i want to load multiple js files in order and then execute a callback. Im trying to use Promise and Deffered to do this
[05:34:04] <clu3> http://jsfiddle.net/77ee51ey/3/
[05:34:13] <clu3> but it doesnt work, some body pls help?
[05:36:05] <Cork> clu3: you don't need deferred there
[05:36:45] <clu3> i'm kinda lost within all this deferred and promise, Cork could you pls help with a fork ?
[05:37:22] <Cork> are the scripts inter dependent on each other?
[05:37:33] <clu3> yes, i want to load them sequentially
[05:37:33] <Cork> or can the scripts load in any order and then execute the alert?
[05:38:08] <clu3> yes they are dependent on each other sequentially
[05:39:30] <clu3> the pipe part is something i googled and copied. but haven't quite put themall together yet
[05:42:49] <Cork> clu3: something like that http://jsfiddle.net/77ee51ey/4/
[05:43:36] <Cork> and one with the missing s :) http://jsfiddle.net/77ee51ey/5/
[05:43:51] <Cork> opps
[05:44:34] <clu3> Cork it's telling me $.Callback is not a function
[05:44:52] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/77ee51ey/6/ and one where i actually remove all old code :)
[05:45:05] <Cork> clu3: that was the "missing s" i just talked about
[05:45:17] <clu3> oh,
[05:45:33] <Cork> /6/ should work as you want
[05:46:02] <Cork> clu3: deferred and when can't help you as you don't want them to run in parallel
[05:46:30] <prohobo> hey, is jquery ui selectable too slow for large lists (100+ objects)?
[05:46:43] <prohobo> cuz i called selectable on a list and it crashes my browser
[05:46:56] <Cork> prohobo: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/3236
[05:47:15] <prohobo> 7 years ago...
[05:47:17] <Cork> prohobo: do you really mean it crashed the browser?
[05:47:29] <prohobo> browser locked up
[05:47:29] <clu3> thank Cork but it's still executing the function first before loading the script
[05:47:30] <clu3> http://jsfiddle.net/t9r814ca/
[05:47:31] <prohobo> not important
[05:47:38] <Cork> cause you should file that as a bug to the browser vendor if you did
[05:47:38] <clu3> I forked it to console.log
[05:48:09] <Cork> clu3: it shouldn't
[05:48:17] <prohobo> cork so they'll attempt to fix performace for 2.0.0
[05:48:20] <prohobo> cool
[05:48:25] <Cork> clu3: no need to fork it, just update the current one
[05:48:40] <clu3> it does in my browser
[05:48:42] <clu3> ok
[05:49:18] <Cork> clu3: well it is as close as getScript lets you get
[05:49:50] <Cork> i guess you could use a setTimeout to add an extra event loop
[05:49:52] <prohobo> wow selectable was really poorly written
[05:49:58] <prohobo> draggable and droppable work just fine
[05:50:11] <eigentor> I have got a function that resizes the portrait images in a slideshow to the height of the highest landscape image. this works, but it does not work on window.resize http://pastebin.com/XLr8zRj7
[05:50:36] <eigentor> When I resize the window, the function appears to get the new image dimensions only after i resize one more time
[05:50:53] <clu3> Cork, where should i place that timeout?
[05:51:10] <Cork> clu3: depends on if the other scripts fails for the same reason
[05:51:20] <eigentor> somehow the height of an image that is resized because it is set to max-width= 100% is not available in the moment of the resize
[05:51:30] <clu3> lets assume there's no failure of loading for the moment
[05:51:32] <eigentor> I could not find a direct pointer online
[05:52:57] <Cork> clu3: also note that getScript avoids the browsers cache
[05:53:04] <Cork> so the script is never loaded from cache
[05:53:25] <eigentor> ah i see this might be a pointer http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10422451/jquery-get-height-of-responsive-image
[05:53:25] <clu3> oh sh*t, that's bad
[05:53:29] <eigentor> to nest the functions
[05:53:52] <clu3> i thought this thing should be simple, turns out it's really killing me
[05:54:12] <Cork> clu3: ya, it is normally best to just use <script> tags
[05:54:29] <Cork> then the browser handles this instead
[05:54:44] <Cork> clu3: you might want to read up on http://api.jquery.com/jquery.getscript/
[05:55:20] <Cork> clu3: also note that $.getScript runs eval on the loaded script
[05:55:44] <Cork> clu3: so you normally get a pain in the but if you ever need to debug the code (as line numbers are all fucked up)
[05:56:08] <clu3> right, that's real bad
[05:56:25] <clu3> i want to load the scripts dynamically, do i have to use requirejs
[05:56:48] <Cork> clu3: requirejs also uses eval
[05:57:01] <Cork> you can't really avoid it if you want script to load script
[05:57:27] <clu3> ok
[05:57:42] <Cork> and often it is better to concat the files into one big file instead
[05:58:00] <Cork> it is most of the time more time saving then constantly pulling files from left and right
[06:20:30] <jasonkarns> does anyone know how to get the jquery compat build (1.x) via npm?
[06:34:10] <TDT> Hey all.  Iâ€™m fairly new to jquery, and am still getting used to it.  I tried googling for something that works, but after many hours I havenâ€™t found what I need.  So, I make an ajax call to my application, which returns a dictionary of elements.  The key is the field id.  In this example, https://gist.github.com/TheDarkTrumpet/ead2c13e4fa564c5f8da I am trying to more or less dynamically update all fields on a form with information gathered.  The calls to inpu
[06:34:11] <TDT> work, and my main problem is line 9.  Some stuff doesnâ€™t have a â€˜valâ€™, like check boxes.  Some stuff apparently have a â€˜valueâ€™ function, but not â€˜valâ€™ as well.  Iâ€™m trying to figure out a way to get this function to work, and the only thing I can think of is trying to verify a particular element responds to a function Iâ€™m interested in, then if it does, then call that function.  I found some code online, but the parsing of the code is a problem. 
[06:34:12] <TDT> there a simpler solution to this, that Iâ€™m overlooking?
[06:34:55] <TDT> To give an idea of whatâ€™s on the page.  I have text boxes (textarea, ckeditor), check boxes, date pickers, and radio buttons.  Pretty much thatâ€™s it.
[06:46:25] <lilsammy__> Does this look wrong? http://pastebin.com/HyVLz2t4 the .some keeps failing with undefined error
[06:55:14] <samssh> lilsammy__, Are you sure that data.results is an array?
[06:59:03] <lilsammy__> samssh my name is sam :D also yeah I think so let me go double check
[06:59:17] <lilsammy__> also the actual error is: Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'some' of undefined
[06:59:39] <kostodo> Has anyone ever seen .blur() work on mobile safari, or is that just a myth?
[06:59:47] <kostodo> No matter what you do, the input fields take focus.
[07:00:30] <lilsammy__> samssh think your right
[07:01:00] <samssh> lilsammy__, Your error would indicate that data.results is undefined.
[07:01:58] <lilsammy__> looks like this "[{"location_id":"1","location_name":"Main Workshop"},{"location_id":"2","location_name":"Painters"}]"
[07:03:09] <lilsammy__> hmmm let me do some debugging now I know what to look at thanks a million samssh
[07:04:24] <lilsammy__> think I got it let me test :)
[07:06:16] <lilsammy__> ah ok I have made progress!
[07:06:38] <lilsammy__> but I have a new error: 'Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'unshift' of undefined' this one seems to be select2 related
[07:07:06] <lilsammy__> http://pastebin.com/qz3txkvb
[07:10:48] <samssh> lilsammy__, I'm not familiar with select2. Are you sure createSearchChoice is being called after the Ajax runs?
[07:11:27] <samssh> I don't see that method on their example or options pages.
[07:14:31] <lilsammy__> ahhhh hmm I did reorder it like
[07:14:32] <lilsammy__> let me look
[07:16:31] <lilsammy__> Doesn't seem to be I will go look into it more I got the method off stackoverflow I will go double check
[07:20:16] <samssh> lilsammy__, Ii could be from an older version.
[07:21:29] <lilsammy__> Yeah wandering that its bundled with a template I think
[07:22:03] <samssh> From the looks of this:https://select2.github.io/options.html#ajax I'd guess that if you want to modify the return results, you should use processResults instead of createSearchChoice.
[07:22:14] <Jerney_> Hey all, maybe I'm missing something obvious, but is there a way to 'suscribe' to the jQuery blog?
[07:24:12] <lilsammy__> thanks samssh will give that a shot
[07:25:35] <Wyclef> hello, does anyone know how to remove the play button from a youtube embed? you would use query to interface with the youtube api correct?
[07:26:06] <Xatenev> Wyclef: controls=0
[07:26:09] <Xatenev> done
[07:26:24] <Wyclef> i'm familiar with all that however my client is insistent. STUBBORNLY insistent
[07:26:27] <Wyclef> that the play button is removed
[07:26:39] <Wyclef> like, i will get fired if i don't remove the play button
[07:26:49] <Wyclef> and he only will use youtube
[07:27:00] <Xatenev> Wyclef: did u read what i write?
[07:27:13] <Wyclef> that doesn't remove the play button initially on page load
[07:27:21] <Xatenev> it does.
[07:27:31] <Xatenev> or what play button are we taling about
[07:27:34] <Xatenev> controls=0 hides the whole bottom bar
[07:27:41] <Xatenev> play button volume etc
[07:27:50] <Wyclef> the big red play button in the middle of the video
[07:27:54] <Wyclef> before the video starts
[07:28:10] <Xatenev> ah
[07:28:11] <Xatenev> not possible
[07:28:14] <Xatenev> put an image over it
[07:28:33] <Xatenev> like you have to do it by hand
[07:28:47] <Wyclef> how would i put an image over it
[07:28:56] <negusnegesti> Hi guys!
[07:28:56] <negusnegesti> A question please.
[07:28:56] <negusnegesti> Is it possible to measure the time a user was on a website?
[07:28:56] <negusnegesti> Thx in advance.
[07:29:06] <Xatenev> negusnegesti: google.
[07:29:19] <Xatenev> Wyclef: google: how to put an image over a video
[07:29:39] <Xatenev> via http://img.youtube.com/vi/youtubeid/0.jpg you can get an image of your youtube video
[07:29:55] <Xatenev> youtube automatically generates 4 images for ur video
[07:30:13] <Xatenev> if u put the image over the video, u only have to register an on click listener on ur overlay
[07:30:20] <Wyclef> thx
[07:30:22] <Xatenev> which hides the image, and plays the youtube video =)
[07:41:21] <zorph2> why isn't this tab pane content working? http://plnkr.co/edit/1Z5cBb2g4xjIdhyzQtxs?p=preview
[07:43:30] <Dr-007> anyone knows if its easy to place a picture inside the first option? -> https://jqueryui.com/selectmenu/
[08:03:35] <negusnegesti> Xatenev: OK, I googled and found unload but it doesn't work... any other ideas
[08:03:44] <Xatenev> it does.
[08:03:50] <Xatenev> show ur code ur using
[08:03:58] <Xatenev> and we cna maybe tell u what is going wrong
[08:13:38] <luaboy> how do I get a product's list ,then show the list on page?
[08:20:35] <duckxx_> can someone point to why in Firefox my scrolling thing jumps back to its anchor tag? http://codepen.io/duckx/pen/yNBZQJ
[08:20:39] <duckxx_> it works in chrome fine
[08:21:56] <duckxx_> nvm
[08:21:59] <duckxx_> I got it!
[08:22:18] <duckxx_> what does window.location.hash  do?
[08:22:42] <duckxx_> does that tell the browser to bring u to the hash ?
[08:22:43] <BillCriswell> gets the #whatever in the url
[08:24:08] <duckxx_> i dont understand why firefox goes to that hash when u run that command in the example i have
[08:24:25] <duckxx_> if u remove window.location.hash it works in FF
[08:24:36] <duckxx_> im just wondering why that is.
[08:27:59] <decx> changing hash will fire hashchange in ff and as such go to the hash
[08:28:04] <decx> also ff prefers weed
[08:35:41] <anternat> hello, i have a triple dynamic drop down and drop down values are correctly filled.How do i add a submit button to my code here within jquery ? http://paste2.org/7DfvGP8M
[08:37:18] <robertmaxrees> add a submit button, or bind a listener to a submit button?
[08:38:01] <anternat> add a submit button and send SELECTED values to a php page
[08:38:36] <robertmaxrees> can you add the submit button via your HTML instead?  kind of strange to need to do it with js.
[08:38:42] <anternat> i think i ll hafta use serialize right? but i dont know how to wrap my function in "document ready"
[08:39:32] <robertmaxrees> you should already have a submit button in the form, then.
[08:39:50] <anternat> robertmaxrees i think i ll hafta do it with jquery as results coming from getstate and getcity dont appear on web page
[08:40:08] <robertmaxrees> that has nothing to do with the submit button though.
[08:40:41] <anternat> without a submit button do i have an alternative to post the selected values?
[08:40:54] <robertmaxrees> why isn't there already a submit button on the page?
[08:41:10] <robertmaxrees> i'm really confused about why you're writing in one with JS instead of having one in your HTML already.
[08:41:35] <anternat> the tutor i was following to make my multi dynamic drop-down didnt have one ://
[08:42:19] <anternat> this is a country/state/city project where data is pulled dynamically,but i dont know how to post them back yet :/
[08:43:14] <robertmaxrees> that's fine - can you create a fiddle that shows what your markup and js all look like together?
[08:43:18] <robertmaxrees> it's fine if it doesn't function.
[08:43:22] <anternat> i think i need something lie serialize() thingy
[08:43:32] <anternat> but i am unsure
[08:43:33] <robertmaxrees> it's hard to know without seeing your HTML.
[08:45:25] <anternat> http://paste2.org/wEcWHE23
[08:46:28] <robertmaxrees> yeah, you need to add a submit button first.
[08:46:33] <robertmaxrees> not withjquery - put it in your html/.
[08:47:09] <robertmaxrees> you've also got some syntax errors with your JS.  one sec.
[08:47:41] <anternat> Oh really? didnt notice as i directly copied&pasted
[08:48:15] <robertmaxrees> open your console - you'll see errors getting spit out on that page.
[08:48:25] <anternat> this part : $(document).ready(function(){
[08:48:26] <anternat> $('#form1').submit(function(){
[08:48:43] <anternat> from another page as i was trying to test,ignoe them please
[08:48:48] <robertmaxrees> ...
[08:48:50] <robertmaxrees> why do people do that?
[08:49:02] <robertmaxrees> "here's my code - just ignore x, y, and z"
[08:49:04] <robertmaxrees> one sec.
[08:49:43] <robertmaxrees> so onChange is a bad thing to use.
[08:50:26] <anternat> i was working on this to adept mine: http://phppot.com/jquery/jquery-dependent-dropdown-list-countries-and-states/
[08:50:51] <robertmaxrees> yeah, don't follow that.
[08:50:55] <robertmaxrees> onchange is a bad thing to use.
[08:50:56] <robertmaxrees> one sec.
[08:50:59] <anternat> okay
[08:52:20] <robertmaxrees> http://fixee.org/paste/qoaolek/ - see how I changed the stuff for #country-list ?
[08:52:48] <anternat> let me look
[08:53:04] <robertmaxrees> now it's using $('#country-list').on('change', function() {}); instead of onchange in your html.
[08:54:18] <anternat> $(document).ready(function() {
[08:54:31] <robertmaxrees> what about it?
[08:54:43] <anternat> you wrapped other my 2 functions inside this,right? which i was trying to do but couldnt
[08:54:52] <anternat> i ll upload & see..
[08:54:55] <robertmaxrees> right - because you had a syntax error with yours.
[08:54:59] <anternat> i ll be back
[08:55:07] <robertmaxrees> i'm gone in 5 for a sprint planning.
[08:55:15] <robertmaxrees> but this should get you on the right track.
[08:55:19] <Dr-007> anyone knows if its easy to place a picture inside the first option thats inmediatly visible? -> https://jqueryui.com/selectmenu/
[08:55:52] <anternat> thank you very much, i ll put an offline msg to your private if u dont mind(about the result)
[08:56:01] <robertmaxrees> no need to.
[08:56:06] <anternat> okay
[08:56:08] <robertmaxrees> you can follow up in the channel later.
[08:56:19] <anternat> all right,thanks again
[08:56:42] <negusnegesti>  Xatenev: Sorry for my late response. the code is here: http://pastie.org/10109948
[08:56:50] <c0d3n4m3> Hey guys, I'm wondering what this means: height = +320 - +152;
[08:57:02] <c0d3n4m3> What are the +'s doing in front of the numbers?
[08:57:08] <robertmaxrees> c0d3n4m3 is that the actual code?
[08:57:21] <robertmaxrees> or at those numbers variables in the actual version?
[08:57:26] <c0d3n4m3> A snippet from a window.resize function
[08:57:29] <decx> + is a hack to make sure a number is a number
[08:57:33] <c0d3n4m3> Ah
[08:57:36] <robertmaxrees> yeah.
[08:57:40] <decx> like parseInt
[08:57:44] <c0d3n4m3> Cool, I never knew that. :) Thank you guys!
[08:57:45] <robertmaxrees> normally used on vars to coerce.
[08:57:49] <c0d3n4m3> Ah, ok
[08:57:56] <decx> yeah doesnt really make sense in front of an actual number
[08:58:43] <anternat> city list isnt filled up robertmaxrees
[08:58:45] <c0d3n4m3> So can you declare a number to be a number in jQuery like you have to in c#? Without having to put a + in front of the number?
[08:58:45] <Dr-007> i agree its kind of confusing. but i didnt know that either.
[08:58:59] <robertmaxrees> anternat i was just correcting some minor issues with your code.
[08:59:12] <Dr-007> better use parseInt for clean code
[08:59:13] <c0d3n4m3> is there parseInt() for jQuery
[08:59:14] <c0d3n4m3> Ah
[08:59:16] <c0d3n4m3> cool
[08:59:19] <c0d3n4m3> :)
[08:59:20] <anternat> okay robbieSti
[08:59:27] <robertmaxrees> c0d3n4m3 for javascript yeah.
[08:59:35] <anternat> robertmaxrees*
[08:59:39] <robertmaxrees> bbiab
[08:59:42] <c0d3n4m3> Thank you all! Time to slink back into my corner >.>
[08:59:44] <decx> if you dont use quotes then a number is just a number
[08:59:52] <c0d3n4m3> yeah, that's what I thought
[09:00:26] <Omar-> http://jsfiddle.net/Palestinian/zvopbfkp/ how to make it in one line?
[09:03:04] <decx> use slice instead if it has to be one line
[09:03:48] <decx> var fruits = "Banana Orange Apple Mango".split(" ").slice(0,-1) or something
[09:06:34] <Omar-> decx thanks .slice(1, length of array) worked
[09:06:42] <Omar-> i want to remove first value in an array
[09:07:15] <decx> but you removed the last
[09:08:00] <decx> just use shift and two lines then
[09:09:08] <Omar-> okay decx i'll test it
[09:34:36] <negusnegesti> negus
[10:41:15] <phretor> is it known that jQuery (bower installed, jquery/dist/jquery.js) fails if post-processed with yuglify?
[10:41:26] <robertmaxrees> ask in #jquery-dev
[10:42:22] <arthurvr> phretor: to answer your question directly: https://github.com/yui/yuglify/issues/19
[10:42:33] <robertmaxrees> hah
[10:42:49] <robertmaxrees> sounds like yuglify should fix it anyway, right?
[10:43:09] <arthurvr> yuglify is a dead project
[10:43:13] <arthurvr> so they wonâ€™t fix it
[10:43:18] <robertmaxrees> oh wow.
[10:43:26] <arthurvr> phretor: and Iâ€™d just suggest you to not use it :p
[10:43:39] <phretor> arthurvr: you mean yuglify?
[10:43:42] <robertmaxrees> 2 years since its last update.
[10:43:51] <arthurvr> yes
[10:44:01] <arthurvr> April 13 2013
[10:44:02] <phretor> yuicompressor seems a better alternative
[10:44:13] <arthurvr> also http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/14998
[10:44:18] <arthurvr> not a jQuery bug ^
[10:45:37] <anternat> ./restart
[10:50:38] <snover> yui was discontinued last year.
[10:53:52] <robertmaxrees> looks like yuicompressor lives on though? https://github.com/yui/yuicompressor
[10:57:28] <notchris> When wrapping an item, how can I wrap two divs around a selection?
[10:57:48] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/wrap/
[10:57:51] <notchris> .wrap(â€˜<div><div></div></div>â€™);
[10:58:06] <notchris> robertmaxrees: I read that, was having an issue, Iâ€™ll try again
[10:58:41] <robertmaxrees> you could use the function instea.d
[10:58:48] <decx> <div><div> will do
[10:58:48] <robertmaxrees> wait nvm ignore more.
[10:59:06] <robertmaxrees> s/more/me
[11:00:22] <notchris> hmmm
[11:01:00] <decx> if you dont want to wrap separately use wrapAll
[11:01:12] <robertmaxrees> why are you wrapping an element in two divs?
[11:01:22] <robertmaxrees> that seems really... strange.
[11:01:25] <decx> he's wrapping a list and divving it twice
[11:01:37] <robertmaxrees> gonna find out whose CSS is nice.
[11:01:46] <robertmaxrees> notchris clause is comin' to town.
[11:01:57] <decx> not santa chris?
[11:01:59] <decx> :(
[11:02:10] <robertmaxrees> even better
[11:37:40] <notchris> robertmaxrees: Haha nice
[11:54:48] <robbieSti> anyway possible to find size() dynamically generated content?
[11:55:06] <robertmaxrees> you mean .length?
[11:55:09] <robertmaxrees> and sure - select it.
[11:55:18] <robertmaxrees> $('.yourThing').length
[11:55:42] <robbieSti> so size didn't do it, length might
[11:55:48] <robertmaxrees> size is deprecated.
[11:56:16] <robertmaxrees> if you're storing the result of your selector in a vaor before you pop your stuff into the DOM, you're going to have a bad time with that.
[11:57:09] <robbieSti> its still not counting the number of dynamically generated elements
[11:57:10] <robbieSti> var fieldValueCountNext = $("#tablebody tr").length+1;
[11:57:42] <robertmaxrees> share your code?
[11:59:56] <robbieSti> http://pastebin.com/PUuC8ifi
[12:02:46] <robbieSti> rofl sorry
[12:02:50] <robertmaxrees> heh.
[12:02:51] <robbieSti> #tablebody
[12:02:57] <robertmaxrees> also, jsfiddle.
[12:02:59] <robbieSti> suppose to be .tablebody
[12:03:14] <robbieSti> ok ill load it in jsfiddle thanks robert
[12:03:27] <robbieSti> fixed it now should work as intended
[12:05:17] <robbieSti> $('a#field'+fieldValueCountNext).editable('setValue', null); appears to be implicit iterative
[12:07:27] <robertmaxrees> editable()?
[12:07:29] <robertmaxrees> that a plugin?
[12:07:48] <robertmaxrees> and yes, many jquery methods use .each() under the hood so you don't have to.
[12:08:16] <robbieSti> oh! yes, its a bootstrap xeditable framework
[12:08:41] <robbieSti> ok thanks so would i just have to do a conditional return
[12:08:44] <robbieSti> or skip*
[12:08:47] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[12:09:52] <robbieSti> .each() applies to each, how do i tell it to skip a specific one?
[12:10:08] <robertmaxrees> why would you want to skip one?
[12:10:25] <robertmaxrees> are you trying to not init on those that already have it?
[12:10:42] <robbieSti> yes
[12:11:00] <robertmaxrees> i'd check to see if that's even an issue.  if it is, i'd manually init when you append the element in.
[12:11:05] <robertmaxrees> instead of trying to do it afterward.
[12:12:16] <robbieSti> oh ok
[12:14:23] <dglambert> Yo
[12:14:49] <dglambert> Does chrome have issues with this syntax, $('#' + $(this).val())
[12:14:59] <robertmaxrees> depends on what's in that value.
[12:15:32] <dglambert> Do i need to create a string before
[12:15:50] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[12:15:52] <robertmaxrees> what's the value?
[12:16:03] <dglambert> $('#regionTargetsDropDown option')
[12:16:11] <robertmaxrees> that should work fine.
[12:16:25] <robertmaxrees> wait.
[12:16:29] <robertmaxrees> that's the actual value?
[12:16:57] <dglambert> <option value="7371">North America</option>
[12:17:02] <dglambert> etc
[12:17:25] <hasan> hi all. I'm wondering how I could realize a timer which will be displayed in real time in the browser.
[12:18:16] <dglambert> do I need to use attr("value")
[12:18:23] <robertmaxrees> use .val();
[12:18:57] <dglambert> I was
[12:19:07] <robertmaxrees> that's the right thing to use.
[12:19:19] <robertmaxrees> not sure what to tell you.  can you fiddle an example of your problem?
[12:19:48] <dglambert> http://pastebin.com/XwsqLvL6
[12:20:04] <dglambert> thats the whole function, not much to it
[12:20:05] <robertmaxrees> that's not what I meant.
[12:20:09] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/hr3fmnb8/
[12:20:13] <robertmaxrees> an actual, funcitoning exampke.
[12:20:16] <robertmaxrees> *example
[12:20:21] <dglambert> yeah I know, I posted it before I saw your response
[12:21:13] <robertmaxrees> bbiab food
[12:27:33] <zzaichik1> a
[12:31:24] <robbieSti> i dont like jquery doing implicit iterations
[12:31:29] <robbieSti> i want full control!!!!!!!!!!!!!
[12:31:39] <robertmaxrees> it's actually really convenient most of the time.
[12:32:23] <robbieSti> is there a way to disable the implicitness
[12:32:43] <robertmaxrees> use IDs for everything instead?
[12:33:01] <robertmaxrees> write your code in a way there you work with the implicit nature, instead of against it.
[12:33:13] <robbieSti> can i return false?
[12:33:26] <robertmaxrees> from where?
[12:33:39] <robertmaxrees> you could always .first() every selector I guess.
[12:33:58] <Scriptonaut> do you guy sknow a good way to change the css for an element's :before selector?
[12:34:17] <robertmaxrees> Scriptonaut by using css to set it?
[12:34:29] <Scriptonaut> there's some style datepicker:before, I want to change one of its properties
[12:34:33] <Scriptonaut> no using jquery
[12:34:47] <robertmaxrees> Scriptonaut add/remove a class and style that classes :before in your css instead.
[12:35:02] <Scriptonaut> that's what I'm doin now, just wanted to see ift here was a way to directly do it
[12:35:05] <Scriptonaut> thanks
[12:36:48] <ilhami> hey guys.
[12:37:47] <robertmaxrees> sup ilhami
[12:38:20] <ilhami> never mind.. I enabled cors :D
[12:53:40] <unnu> how does one select the name attribute of a input button inside of a label field when the label is clicked?
[12:53:53] <robertmaxrees> wut
[12:53:58] <robertmaxrees> you mean get the value of the name?'
[12:54:04] <unnu> yeah
[12:54:08] <robertmaxrees> .prop('name')
[12:56:05] <unnu> ive got <label class="btn radiothing"><input type="radio" name="VALUE1">clickme</label> so i have $('.radiothing').click(function(){  var idthing = $(this).closest('input').attr('name'); });
[12:56:26] <robertmaxrees> .find()
[12:56:30] <robertmaxrees> closest() goes "up".
[12:56:30] <unnu> it is failing miserably because i don't _really_ know jquery, i just fumble around until it works
[12:56:31] <unnu> :P
[12:56:37] <robertmaxrees> .prop('name')
[13:01:47] <Wyclef> yo can someone tell me why this isn't working? trying to create an overlay play button image that you use for a youtube video that when you click displays none and then the iframe embed starts playing. this basically works except the onparentnode isn't finding the iframe for some reason and displaying it to block? just want to make sure the syntax is correct here http://pastebin.com/HWwZLa1z
[13:36:15] <hd1> http://pastebin.com/hU3M7UnQ isn't working :(
[13:38:31] <robertmaxrees> is it unemployed?
[13:39:21] <hd1> huh?
[13:39:29] <hd1> the hover isn't being triggered
[13:39:50] <robertmaxrees> is it in a document ready/included after the html in question?
[13:39:56] <robertmaxrees> or is it the ajax that's broken?
[13:40:33] <hd1> huh?
[13:40:58] <robertmaxrees> clarify your problem.
[13:40:58] <hd1> the alert isn't being triggered, if that's what you're asking me
[13:41:06] <robertmaxrees> okay.
[13:41:09] <hd1> line 3
[13:41:12] <robertmaxrees> is this inside of a document ready?
[13:41:29] <hd1> no
[13:41:49] <robertmaxrees> is it included in the page before the closing body tag or otherwise after the relevant markup?
[13:42:19] <hd1> it's a separate file and is included in the head tag
[13:42:32] <robertmaxrees> you need to wrap the code in a document ready then.
[13:43:02] <robertmaxrees> $(function() { /* your code here */ });
[13:43:24] <hd1> http://links.d8u.us/ is the page it's included on
[13:43:31] <robertmaxrees> ...
[13:43:37] <robertmaxrees> your need to wrap your code in a document ready.
[13:43:44] <robertmaxrees> or move the script include to just before the closing body tag.
[13:43:56] <robertmaxrees> the HTML doesn't exist when you make the call to .on(), so the binding fails.
[13:46:43] <hd1> I've moved the script tag, and it still isn't being loaded
[13:46:54] <robertmaxrees> is the alert firing?
[13:47:17] <robertmaxrees> oh, open your console.
[13:47:21] <robertmaxrees> syntax error.
[13:51:03] <hd1> ok, now I'm getting somewhere
[13:52:09] <hd1> not well formed
[13:54:02] <robertmaxrees> also, you want mouseenter, not hover
[13:54:45] <robertmaxrees> and jQuery.tooltip('/summary?page='+page.prop('href'), { breaks because there's no tooltip lib loaded on the page.
[13:57:01] <Wyclef> hello, wondering if someone here can help me with some getElementBy stuff? i'm really beating my head against the desk and am so close to solving something but its just one of those things i'm not seeing the solution
[13:57:12] <robertmaxrees> !ask @ Wyclef
[13:57:12] <b-ot> Wyclef: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[13:57:32] <Wyclef> i've got this script... http://pastebin.com/a78Lumf1
[13:57:41] <Wyclef> it overlays an image and a play button over a youtube video...
[13:57:43] <robertmaxrees> woah.
[13:57:50] <robertmaxrees> <div onclick="this.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('iframe')[0].style.display='block';  nooooo
[13:57:51] <Wyclef> when you click the thumbnail... it hides and the video starts to play
[13:58:11] <robertmaxrees> don't use onclick for starters.
[13:58:20] <Wyclef> please god, can we put that aside for 5 min
[13:58:20] <robertmaxrees> do you have jquery loaded on the page?
[13:58:27] <Wyclef> problem i am having is that on paper, this works fine... in practice... it is used in an environment where fitvids.js is utilized
[13:58:29] <robertmaxrees> you asked us for help.
[13:58:31] <Wyclef> so the iframe is wrapped in a div
[13:58:41] <Wyclef> div class fluid-video-wrapper-whatever
[13:59:03] <Wyclef> so i need to modify this to do what its doing to the iframe but also to this wrapper div thats generated on page load
[13:59:25] <Wyclef> i'm just trying to use on click to sort out the method here
[13:59:36] <Wyclef> i will remove that when i get this functioning
[13:59:51] <robertmaxrees> do you have jquery available on the page?
[13:59:55] <Wyclef> sorry to snap i am under duress trying to figure this out
[13:59:56] <Wyclef> yea
[14:00:33] <Nasp> wycats What is it you want it to do?
[14:00:42] <Wyclef> yes i have jquery on the page
[14:00:52] <Nasp> ehm Wyclef
[14:01:14] <Wyclef> i want to do what i'm doing with the iframe, but simultaneously with it's wrapping div class fluid-width-video-wrapper
[14:01:18] <Wyclef> thats generated on page load
[14:01:31] <Wyclef> you can call me wyturd for all i care
[14:02:06] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/3uh9v80p/
[14:02:13] <robertmaxrees> it'll look something like this if you have jquery available.
[14:02:57] <Wyclef> what will that do exactly?
[14:04:06] <Nasp> Well you haven't specified what you want it do do
[14:04:19] <Nasp> Just want to do it with the iframe simultaneously
[14:04:21] <robertmaxrees> get the parent div to the .play-button, bind an event listener, find the sibling iframe, set it to display block, then hide that div.
[14:04:28] <robertmaxrees> i know exactly what he's trying to do.
[14:05:27] <Nasp> One thing is what the code says, another is what he's trying to acomplish
[14:05:35] <robertmaxrees> reread the logs.
[14:05:39] <robertmaxrees> it's pretty clear what he wants.
[14:05:42] <Wyclef> i know what i posted is crap. but currently it functions, what isn't functioning is that this stupid fit-vid-div-wrapper around the iframe isn't being set to display: none on page load, so you see an empty block pushing the thumbnail down
[14:06:03] <Wyclef> i was trying to also hide that div wrapper of the iframe at the same time as the iframe
[14:06:31] <Wyclef> you'd have to be familiar with what fitvid.js does i guess for what i'm talking about to entirely make sense
[14:06:40] <robertmaxrees> then make a fiddle demonstrating what you're trying to do.
[14:06:42] <cjohnson> sounds like it doesn't function then :P
[14:07:12] <robertmaxrees> this is all relatively trivial stuff - hiding/showing things on pageload is pretty basic.
[14:07:50] <robertmaxrees> woops closest starts with the current element - i forgot about this: http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/3uh9v80p/1/
[14:08:09] <Wyclef> right. so how would i hide a div that's wrapping the iframe in the crappy script i posted at the same time as hiding the iframe
[14:08:16] <Wyclef> whoops, let me check your fiddle
[14:08:31] <robertmaxrees> you just need to hide the parent of the iframe.
[14:08:40] <robertmaxrees> display: none; will cause everything to disappear.
[14:10:21] <Nasp> If you want the parent div you should use .parent
[14:10:22] <Nasp> :)
[14:10:36] <robertmaxrees> right.
[14:10:39] <robertmaxrees> look at my last fiddle.
[14:10:40] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[14:10:56] <Nasp> aha
[14:11:09] <Nasp> Which is why i asked for an explanation of what you wanted to do
[14:11:18] <robertmaxrees> like i said, i always forget .closest() starts with the current element.
[14:11:26] <robertmaxrees> it's not what I wanted, it's what Wyclef wanted.
[14:11:26] <Nasp> It also seems strange
[14:11:34] <Nasp> How often do you need to search on the current element?
[14:11:44] <robertmaxrees> that's actually pretty common.
[14:11:47] <Nasp> i asked him
[14:22:58] <ilhami> hey
[14:23:02] <ilhami> do you guys like datatables.net?
[14:23:44] <robertmaxrees> lots of people do.
[14:23:50] <robertmaxrees> but we get a LOT of support requests here for it.
[14:24:02] <ilhami> should I use it for dispaying employees at a company? :d
[14:24:04] <ilhami> displaying
[14:24:06] <ilhami> I am not sure.
[14:24:18] <robertmaxrees> do you need everything it offers?
[14:24:27] <robertmaxrees> like, are you just displaying a directory?
[14:24:46] <ilhami> just displaying some data :)
[14:24:51] <robertmaxrees> then just use a table.
[14:25:00] <robertmaxrees> or a ul.
[14:25:09] <ilhami> and maybe a clickable row :P
[14:25:14] <robertmaxrees> for what?
[14:25:20] <ilhami> for displaying extra info :)
[14:25:27] <ilhami> I don't tend to display everything in the table
[14:25:31] <ilhami> intendÃ˜
[14:25:32] <ilhami> *
[14:25:36] <robertmaxrees> display it all on pageload or use tooltips.
[14:26:03] <ilhami> Gonna display rest in a modal overlay :D
[14:26:07] <ilhami> or what it's called.
[14:26:31] <ilhami> like a popup that can easily be closed with escape button :)
[14:26:37] <robertmaxrees> that's a modal.
[14:26:43] <robertmaxrees> i'd use a tooltip though.
[14:26:55] <ilhami> why ? It's a lot of data including files.
[14:26:57] <robertmaxrees> unless there's stuff to interact with inside of it.
[14:27:00] <robertmaxrees> whaaaa.
[14:27:10] <robertmaxrees> this doens't really sound like a directory then.
[14:27:48] <ilhami> I am going to display employee information and when you click on each employee's row you should see extra info including contracts etc.
[14:28:06] <Nasp_> Just make a table first, then you'll figure out what you need
[14:28:19] <robertmaxrees> i'd push users to a new page at that point.
[14:28:19] <Nasp_> I'm actually making the same thing with employees
[14:28:59] <ilhami> Using Lumen for my API. :)
[14:29:05] <Nasp_> We discussed new page, inline operations, modal, or just use the remaining space in the sidebar
[14:29:29] <ilhami> so what did you end up with?
[14:29:32] <Nasp_> Us that lua?
[14:29:36] <Nasp_> Using the sidebar for now
[14:29:48] <Nasp_> It's just an edit page
[14:29:52] <ilhami> well my sidebar looks a bit like Wordpress'
[14:29:54] <Nasp_> It can easily be changed
[14:30:07] <ilhami> it's more like a menu :P
[14:30:09] <Nasp_> Not as much a sidebar as space left over on the page
[14:30:15] <Nasp_> For a form
[14:30:30] <Nasp_> ilhami Are you using lua for building a rest api?
[14:31:19] <ilhami> I am using Lumen I said. :P
[14:31:28] <ilhami> Laravel based micro framework.
[14:31:48] <ilhami> http://lumen.laravel.com/
[14:32:49] <Nasp_> Ohh php
[14:33:23] <ilhami> Of course.
[14:33:49] <Nasp_> You say ofc like that's what people always use
[14:34:19] <ilhami> well PHP has one of the biggest communities. :P
[14:35:25] <ilhami> do you  use Lua?
[14:36:08] <Nasp_> nope
[14:36:14] <ilhami> what then? C#?
[14:36:17] <Nasp_> But when i searched for Lumen i found some LUA stuff
[14:36:19] <Nasp_> yes ofc
[14:36:19] <Nasp_> :)
[14:36:28] <ilhami> Yeah because I know you from Quakenet.
[14:36:31] <Nasp_> yup
[14:36:38] <Nasp_> I think i suggested you to use Nancy
[14:36:39] <ilhami> and you are Danish.
[14:37:01] <ilhami> Nancy?
[14:37:30] <Nasp_> NancyFx
[14:37:34] <Nasp_> For api
[14:37:53] <ilhami> I never saw that.
[14:37:57] <Nasp_> Hmm
[14:38:00] <ilhami> but looks cool.
[14:38:01] <Nasp_> Must have been someone else then
[14:38:07] <Nasp_> It's great
[14:38:14] <Nasp_> It's quite simple, which is nice
[14:38:24] <ilhami> yeah I like simplicity.
[14:39:10] <robmal> There is nothing wrong with lumen imho.
[14:40:16] <ilhami> robmal, there isn't. But I should have used a Python based API framework
[14:40:22] <ilhami> Python is so freaking fast compared to PHP.
[14:41:30] <robmal> Sure, but from what i read you're trying to display employee details. That's not very complicated.
[14:42:02] <ilhami> It's not of course. :)
[14:42:12] <ilhami> I just dunno if I want to use a table. I hate html tables :/
[14:42:22] <robertmaxrees> you have tabular data.
[14:42:25] <robertmaxrees> that's what they're for.
[14:42:43] <ilhami> I guess so. :P
[14:42:43] <robmal> Yep.
[14:45:23] <ilhami> do you think that jQuery is one of the most popular libraries ever?
[14:45:30] <Nasp_> Tables are fin
[14:45:43] <robertmaxrees> ilhami that's a tough one.  i think it's one of the most utilized ones ever
[14:45:47] <Nasp_> People just stopped using and used divs for everything
[14:45:49] <Nasp_> Even tabular data
[14:46:03] <ilhami> Nasp_, but is it wrong to use divs for tabular data? :D
[14:46:10] <ilhami> semantically
[14:46:15] <robertmaxrees> the hate for tables came from the fact that people were abusing them.
[14:46:21] <Nasp_> semantically it makes more sense
[14:46:32] <ilhami> to use tables, right? :)
[14:46:33] <Nasp_> robertmaxrees you didn't have a choice back in the days
[14:46:40] <Nasp_> All styling was done through tables
[14:46:42] <robertmaxrees> Nasp_ i'm aware.
[14:46:43] <Nasp_> And it was not nice
[14:46:44] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[14:46:48] <Nasp_> table in table in table in table
[14:46:52] <ilhami> hah
[14:47:02] <ilhami> even page structure of a website was made with tables.
[14:47:07] <robertmaxrees> but people stuck with them for a little longer than they needed.
[14:47:26] <ilhami> doug16k, :D
[15:00:10] <Synthead> I want to make selectmenu produce a flyout menu like a regular $().menu() would.  Can I create a .selectmenu() and replace its menu with .menu() somehow?
[15:02:16] <Synthead> I notice that if I run $("select").data(), there's uiMenu and uiSelectmenu attributes
[15:03:22] <kokut> Hello, i'm using sticky.js and for some reason i can't understand, when it sets the position of the element to fixed the element moves to the top left of the browser, is there anything i can do to fix this? I need it to be on the same position (horizontally) on the screen when the sticky is activated.
[15:08:59] <royalty> hello, suppose i retrieve some variable data from an ajax request
[15:09:20] <royalty> but i only want some parts of "data" to work with, in this case data is just html
[15:09:40] <royalty> how do i go about splitting up the data?
[15:10:04] <Synthead> royalty: do you have any control over the data you're receiving, or is it from a third-party?
[15:10:50] <royalty> i have control but i would rather not modify it... i guess i can just make another method which returns the relevant parts of the html
[15:10:54] <royalty> that might be easier
[15:11:17] <Synthead> royalty: yeah, if the data is yours and it isn't fitting your needs, I'd adapt the data
[15:11:27] <Synthead> royalty: however, is it html or something? json?
[15:11:34] <royalty> html
[15:11:55] <Synthead> royalty: could just use selectors on it as usual
[15:12:06] <royalty> hmmmm
[15:12:38] <royalty> var test = data.find('.test');
[15:12:40] <Synthead> royalty: something like this: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9551230/jquery-selectors-on-a-html-string
[15:12:40] <royalty> like that?
[15:12:41] <royalty> lol
[15:13:00] <royalty> oh ok
[15:13:02] <royalty> awesome
[15:13:03] <royalty> thanks!
[15:13:25] <Synthead> royalty: you're welcome!
[15:14:30] <Synthead> royalty: however, bear in mind that if you're fetching more data than you need, your webserver will be slower, the data will take longer to download, and the client side will have to do more work
[15:14:59] <Synthead> royalty: I would split up the data into different views, and add a route that fetches only this data
[15:15:12] <royalty> it's ok i hate the client and want to get this done
[15:15:22] <Synthead> royalty: hahaha.  all good :)
[15:15:26] <royalty> lol
[15:15:39] <Synthead> royalty: don't mess with people that cook your food, cut your hair, and write your websites ;)
[15:16:07] <royalty> Synthead, exactly!
[15:16:09] <kokut> k i have to change left: -100px to margin-left: -100px... just in case anyone has the same issue..
[15:16:13] <kokut> had*
[15:29:23] <jnhghy> I'm having trouble with an ajax call (using wordpress) I'm trying to get a variable in ajax and then send it back as an echo, the thing is it works fine on chrome but crashes on firefox the code I'm using is from jquery-ui https://jqueryui.com/dialog/#modal-form
[15:29:58] <jnhghy> I've read that the preventDefault might break on firefox but I didn't understood how to fix it, any idea what's going on?
[15:30:09] * robertmaxrees looks into his crystal ball
[15:30:12] <robertmaxrees> weird, i can't see your code.
[15:32:16] <jnhghy> robertmaxrees: funny, I know you don't see my code ... it's on localhost... very hard to put it online ... I thought I might find someone how knows what usually breaks firefox but not chrome when it comes to ajax calls...
[15:32:28] <robertmaxrees> noithing should.
[15:32:34] <robertmaxrees> fixee your code.
[15:33:20] <jnhghy> I agree nothing should but I'm looking at these 2 browsers and running the same page and one works and the other one doesn't ... how can I debug this ? :)
[15:33:41] <robertmaxrees> http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide1
[15:33:49] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, fixee the js that you think is causing the problem.
[15:33:52] <robertmaxrees> brb
[15:41:05] <gtwy> any reason why .keyup wouldnt be working?
[15:41:16] <gtwy> do i need to make some kind of prerequisite call to activate monitoring the page for changes?
[15:41:25] <robertmaxrees> is the element added after pageload?
[15:41:42] <gtwy> the element is part of the HTML initially, so no
[15:42:15] <gtwy> one thing ive noticed is that in the code examples on the web, people are putting their keyup scripts in <script> tags at the bottom of the page, where mine is linked in the header
[15:43:01] <gtwy> the only other thing i can think is that the website is https
[15:46:37] <gtwy> robertmaxrees: just want to confirm, this is how i would watch for keyup on an <input type="text" id="CompanyID">
[15:46:44] <gtwy> $( "#CompanyID" ).keyup(function() {
[15:46:45] <gtwy> right?
[15:48:01] <skylo> anyone worked with FlexSlider for Typo here? I find the documentation lacking as usual...
[15:48:41] <robertmaxrees> gtwy you'd need that in a document ready if you're loading in the head.
[15:49:15] <gtwy> do i just put $( document ).ready();
[15:49:22] <gtwy> minus the );
[15:49:23] <gtwy> over pasted
[15:49:28] <gtwy> and then end it below
[15:49:38] <robertmaxrees> or $(function() { /* your code here */});
[15:50:06] <gtwy> here ill paste my full code (its like 4 lines)
[15:50:13] <robertmaxrees> please don't
[15:50:16] <robertmaxrees> not in the channel.
[15:50:21] <gtwy> i meant on pastebin
[15:50:25] <robertmaxrees> alright cool.
[15:51:34] <gtwy> https://jsfiddle.net/u5o0g55u/
[15:51:42] <gtwy> mostly concerned with just the js
[15:52:00] <robertmaxrees> textinput isn't a method.
[15:52:12] <gtwy> same results with keyup
[15:52:15] <gtwy> nothing happens
[15:52:29] <gtwy> textinput was a last ditch effort
[15:52:31] <robertmaxrees> right, you'd need a doc ready.
[15:52:31] <hd1> soddin jquery
[15:52:37] <robertmaxrees> if yours is in the head
[15:53:21] <gtwy> ok so this is a doc ready issue
[15:53:25] <robertmaxrees> yes.
[15:53:27] <robertmaxrees> like I said.
[15:53:43] <noober03> anyone know how i can escape my string that contains => (3" Max.); i keep getting this error => unrecognized expression: (3" Max.)
[15:53:57] <robertmaxrees> gtwy https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/u5o0g55u/2/
[15:54:06] <robertmaxrees> noober03 wat
[15:54:07] <gtwy> robertmaxrees: i appreciate it. ive been reading documentation all day and its hard when youre still getting started
[15:54:17] <robertmaxrees> gtwy checkout out learn.jquery.com
[15:54:39] <gtwy> yeah im headed there now. thanks for fixing the code, too, didnt expect that! was going to start reading on document ready
[15:55:01] <robertmaxrees> basically, if your code is in the head, the html doesn't yet "exist", so you need to wait until it's reayd.
[15:55:03] <noober03> i have a string that is 'Hole(3" Max.)', but when i try to output it, i get unrecognized expression: (3" Max.)
[15:55:04] <robertmaxrees> *ready
[15:55:15] <robertmaxrees> noober03 how are you trying to output it?
[15:55:36] <gtwy> that explains why this worked in the console but not from the js file
[15:55:40] <gtwy> its all coming together now :-)
[15:56:11] <noober03> i am adding it as a popup on a google pushpin map
[15:56:26] <robertmaxrees> because http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/dk8uf917/
[15:56:33] <robertmaxrees> so something doesn't add up.
[15:56:49] <noober03> like latLng.push({ pos:new google.maps.LatLng((this).maint_point.lat,(this).maint_point.lng),category: '<b>Category: </b>' + curr_wo.category,  )
[15:57:35] <gtwy> as you can imagine, that worked. thanks again
[15:57:39] <robertmaxrees> that's not valid code, noober03
[16:01:05] <noober03> error is somewhere else, thanks tho
[16:01:22] <robertmaxrees> except that snippet is broken.
[16:01:25] <robertmaxrees> but okay.
[16:07:21] <Sal> hey guys, i need a little help
[16:07:50] <Sal> 1. whats the best way to get an element of the same parent and same level?
[16:08:02] <robertmaxrees> .siblings()
[16:08:30] <robertmaxrees> or .closest() to get the shared parent and then .find() to get what you want.
[16:09:10] <Sal> 2. whats the best way to get an element of the same level of the current parents level?
[16:09:25] <robertmaxrees> .closest() and then .siblings()
[16:09:29] <robertmaxrees> or the same thing as before.
[16:09:49] <Sal> ok, wait.... let me try to understand better
[16:10:34] <Sal> A, A1, A2, B
[16:10:40] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[16:10:41] <robertmaxrees> lol
[16:10:44] <robertmaxrees> let's setup a fiddle.
[16:10:45] <robertmaxrees> one sec.
[16:10:46] <Sal> i'm on A2
[16:10:52] <Sal> how can get A1 ?
[16:11:06] <Sal> using siblings?
[16:11:26] <robertmaxrees> what you're envisioning with that could be totally different than what i'm envisioning.
[16:11:30] <robertmaxrees> one sec.
[16:11:39] <Sal> ok
[16:11:40] <Sal> thanks
[16:12:49] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/spx1qnLL/
[16:13:03] <robertmaxrees> make sense so far?
[16:13:29] <Sal> let me see
[16:13:37] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/spx1qnLL/1/ styled a bit better
[16:15:20] <robertmaxrees> with the parent sibling deal: http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/spx1qnLL/2/
[16:16:30] <Sal> http://jsfiddle.net/spx1qnLL/3/
[16:16:38] <Sal> look please
[16:16:45] <robertmaxrees> ?
[16:16:54] <Sal> if i'm on b and want a ? i use sivlings?
[16:17:07] <robertmaxrees> ...
[16:17:11] <Sal> siblings
[16:17:12] <robertmaxrees> yeah...?
[16:17:16] <Sal> ok
[16:17:26] <Sal> nad if i wand d?
[16:17:29] <robertmaxrees> there are other ways to do this, but without seeing your actual markup...
[16:17:41] <robertmaxrees> look at my last example.
[16:17:50] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/spx1qnLL/2/ should be able to figure it out from there
[16:18:37] <Sal> ok
[16:20:59] <Sal> shouldn't the last line, change border of the div where i haven't clicked?
[16:21:17] <Sal> closest gets the parent div of the click
[16:21:18] <robertmaxrees> it does.
[16:21:28] <Sal> then sivlings gets the other div of same level
[16:21:28] <robertmaxrees> $(this).closest('div').siblings('div').addClass('parentSibling');
[16:21:31] <robertmaxrees> right.
[16:21:32] <Sal> aint it like that?
[16:21:32] <robertmaxrees> it does.
[16:21:36] <robertmaxrees> it changes it to red.
[16:21:46] <Sal> oh, damn
[16:21:50] <Sal> you choosed red
[16:21:50] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/spx1qnLL/4/
[16:21:58] <Sal> o'm volor blind on red/freen
[16:21:59] <Sal> hehehe
[16:22:01] <Sal> sorry
[16:22:27] <robertmaxrees> 'kay
[16:22:31] <Sal> perfect got it
[16:22:37] <Sal> and find() ?
[16:22:40] <robertmaxrees> this isn't necessarily ideal fwiw.
[16:22:46] <Sal> seache inside the node all levels down?
[16:23:17] <robertmaxrees> !api find
[16:23:17] <b-ot> robertmaxrees: .find(): Get the descendants of each element in the current set of matched elements, filtered by a selector, jQuery object, or element. http://api.jquery.com/find/
[16:23:27] <Sal> no, its only on small spots, like pixels stuff, when is big, like you just changes, i see it clearly
[16:23:29] <Sal> :)
[16:24:05] <Sal> ok, thanks
[16:24:10] <Sal> got to change a lot of code now
[16:24:11] <Sal> hehehe
[16:24:19] <robertmaxrees> this isn't necessarily ideal fwiw.
[16:24:21] <gtwy> robertmaxrees: in this line $( "<h1>" ).text( json.title ).appendTo( "body" ); is "title" the name of a value in the json?
[16:24:24] <Sal> i was making to many queries
[16:24:26] <Sal> hehe
[16:24:45] <robertmaxrees> gtwy that would be the title property of the json object/
[16:25:11] <gtwy> thanks
[16:55:10] <gtwy> how are backspaces tracked? when i backspace my field to nothing, keyup doesnt seem to track it
[17:06:49] <happyface> Is there a way to prevent jquery from applying inline styles when running .toggle twice? Ideally it would attach display:none the first run, and remove that inline style the 2nd run
[17:26:58] <gtwy> my JSON file returns "null" when there's no data in the set
[17:27:02] <gtwy> literally the word "null"
[17:27:12] <gtwy> which must be accurate because jQuery doesnt throw an error
[17:27:14] <gtwy> however
[17:27:28] <gtwy> I am trying to figure out how to write an if statement to determine if the array is "null" or not
[17:27:42] <robertmaxrees> if (return != null) {}
[17:27:44] <gtwy> ive tried if (json.length == 0) but that doesnt work
[17:27:57] <robertmaxrees> is it null with or without quotes?
[17:28:05] <gtwy> without
[17:28:43] <robertmaxrees> then yeah, then yeah, what i sent you.
[17:28:49] <gtwy> lol it was just a simple != null
[17:28:52] <gtwy> you are the man
[17:28:56] <gtwy> i am trying to over think this
[17:29:20] <robertmaxrees> and with that, i disappear.
[17:29:33] <gtwy> saved my butt twice tonight
[17:29:37] <gtwy> what a swell guy
[17:58:17] <Sal> if i click on an element of a list, is there a way to know ig its the first one?
[17:58:34] <Sal> ig=if
[18:38:28] <Devastator> good evening, is there an article explaining folder structure and files of jquery-ui? there are multiple css files, like jquery-ui.css, jquery-ui.min.css, jquery-ui.structure.css etc
[19:30:38] <DragonPunch> is it good semantics to use div.contantEditable = true if i want a textarea with an image inside of it?
[19:32:04] <Krinkle> DragonPunch: Probably not if you expect to get plain text to the server
[19:32:24] <DragonPunch> well.....
[19:32:36] <Krinkle> DragonPunch: If the image is for display purposes and you want the user to only input text (e.g. not bold, paragraphs, html, links etc.), then use a display feature, not a content feature
[19:32:57] <Krinkle> e.g. css background image, or ::before/::after, or a wrapping element and make the input field without a border tranparent next to the image
[19:33:01] <Krinkle> be creative
[19:33:01] <DragonPunch> Krinkle, i want the user to be able to do bold text
[19:33:11] <DragonPunch> like headings
[19:33:40] <Krinkle> That's gonna be a lot of work to get right. contenteditable is a dated feature in browsers you do not want to use.
[19:33:54] <DragonPunch> Krinkle: well then what do you think
[19:34:06] <Krinkle> Unless you're ready for a lot of extra work and maintenance and cross-browser compatibility because contenteditbale is different in every browser.
[19:34:16] <DragonPunch> Krinkle: yeah im not ready for that
[19:34:38] <Krinkle> You'll need a toolbar to control text markup and heading levels, and client- and server-side verification that only whitelsted elements and attribtues are being used
[19:34:49] <Krinkle> e.g. not onload="" or href="javascript:" or <script> etc.
[19:35:11] <DragonPunch> you think the invisible bordes idea is a good sol?
[19:35:40] <Krinkle> DragonPunch: It means no styling like bold or headings
[19:35:50] <DragonPunch> Krinkle: i need headings
[19:35:54] <Krinkle> But you'll be able to display an image that you control
[19:35:59] <Krinkle> DragonPunch: Inside the text area?
[19:36:04] <Krinkle> What for? What is this about?
[19:36:16] <DragonPunch> well...
[19:36:28] <DragonPunch> I am trying to make a network for writers
[19:36:49] <DragonPunch> so i need them to be able to have bold headings
[19:36:57] <Krinkle> Maybe you can create a bit of javascript that adds a button to [+] heading, and [+] text. And it inserts a <type type=text> for heading and <textarea> for text. Allow user to remove them, and drag-and-drop. And then join it together as headings and paragraphs.
[19:36:59] <Krinkle> Just an idea.
[19:37:00] <b-ot> Krinkle: No output.
[19:37:18] <Krinkle> medium.com?
[19:37:29] <Krinkle> wordpress?
[19:38:10] <Krinkle> If you're serious about editing, I can recommend only one thing really. I'm biased because I work on this product myself, but it's called VisualEditor.
[19:38:11] <Krinkle> https://wikimedia.github.io/VisualEditor/demos/ve/desktop-dist.html#!pages/simple.html
[19:38:20] <Krinkle> Freely licensed / open-source. It's what Wikipedia uses.
[19:38:37] <Krinkle> Flexible and can be made simple or very advanced with plugins.
[19:38:47] <DragonPunch> i dont understand other peoples code
[19:39:01] <DragonPunch> i usually work in peoples libraries then take them out and do my custom thing
[19:39:19] <Krinkle> then you better start learning binary, because without interacting with other people's code, you're not getting anywhere in the real world.
[19:39:29] <Krinkle> ;-)
[19:39:33] <DragonPunch> thats aside the point though.
[19:39:41] <Krinkle> it really isn't.
[19:39:48] <DragonPunch> back to the point, what do you think though.
[19:39:55] <Krinkle> Anyway, VisualEditor is a platform you could adopt inside your application.
[19:40:00] <Krinkle> Anything you need to custom, you can add a plugin.
[19:40:00] <DragonPunch> i am thinking that i can display headings in its own div with a invisible border.
[19:40:08] <DragonPunch> Nevermind, i can't do that.
[19:40:15] <DragonPunch> urgh
[19:40:43] <Krinkle> You'll end up with one of three solution: Single text area with special characters for headings (e.g. Markdown) which your users will need to learn.
[19:41:06] <Krinkle> or 2) Separate text areas and input fields for plain paragraphs and headings (no bold text, only text or headings). With the [+] interface I described
[19:41:20] <Krinkle> or 3) A WYSIWYG editor of some kind, like VisualEditor.
[19:41:29] <Krinkle> That generates html to save in your applicatino.
[19:41:50] <Krinkle> TinyMCE and Fckeditor also exist, though a bit unstable and hard to use.
[19:43:57] <gtwy> $( ".listclick" ).click(function() { $( "#AjaxCompanyID" ).val($(this).val); });
[19:43:59] <gtwy> this isnt working
[19:44:01] <gtwy> any ideas?
[19:44:16] <DragonPunch> try
[19:44:16] <gtwy> basically i have a bunch of <li>s and they have a value
[19:44:38] <gtwy> and when i click on one i want it to set input field #ajaxcompanyid to the same value
[19:44:39] <DragonPunch> $(document).on("click", ".listclick", function() { ... } ));
[19:44:53] <DragonPunch> try doing it that way gtwy
[19:45:16] <gtwy> but it works
[19:45:18] <gtwy> it registers that theres a click
[19:45:31] <gtwy> i can put other things in there like "addclass" and it will change the class on an element
[19:45:51] <gtwy> what im hung up on is the this.val
[19:46:07] <Krinkle> gtwy: You need to call val()
[19:46:08] <gtwy> ive tried this.value and $(this).val
[19:46:10] <Krinkle> not pass the function itself
[19:46:21] <gtwy> i think that may be it
[19:46:22] <gtwy> one sec
[19:46:28] <rcyr> gtwy: It's either this.value (DOM) or $(this).val() (jQuery)
[19:46:32] <Krinkle> val( ... val() )
[19:46:55] <gtwy> $( "#AjaxCompanyID" ).val($(this).val());
[19:46:56] <otahak> do I need to stringify an object in JQ before passing it to php to write to JSON?
[19:46:57] <gtwy> still not working
[19:47:22] <gtwy> im trying to set the value of #AjaxCompanyID the same as what is being clicked's value
[19:47:58] <DragonPunch> Krinkle: i'm thinking along the liens of this
[19:48:24] <otahak> gtwy - use .val()
[19:48:25] <Krinkle> gtwy: What isn't working? What is failing? What do you see and what do you expect to happen instead?
[19:48:26] <gtwy> val() is for retreiving elements only, isnt it
[19:48:33] <Krinkle> No
[19:48:53] <Krinkle> gtwy: Can you reproduce the issue on jsfiddle.net?
[19:49:15] <DragonPunch> Krinkle: wrap the message around a ul and each li represents a line. when the user clicks H it generates a li that has a heading kind of feel. at the end, i have a for loop that iterates through the UL and parses that ul and generates the proper data to store in the database.
[19:49:20] <Krinkle> Debug it by removing unrelated parts and you'll find the issue is not in the code you showed, that part is working
[19:49:26] <DragonPunch> Krinkle: what do you think? that will work right?
[19:49:28] <gtwy> i dont know if i can,  its dependent on a JSON
[19:49:49] <Krinkle> gtwy: Clicking elements does not depend on JSON.
[19:49:55] <Krinkle> Replace it with sample data
[19:50:08] <DragonPunch> krinkle what do you think mate.
[19:50:33] <gtwy> theres LIs. they have values. when you click one, it changes a text field to the value
[19:50:43] <gtwy> all of the LIs are class .listclick
[19:50:49] <gtwy> so i watch for a click on any .listclick object
[19:51:25] <gtwy> i want to then replace the value of the #AjaxCompanyID text field with the value of the LI i clicked on
[19:51:34] <Krinkle> gtwy: add some console.log messages in your code. console.log('clicked'), console.log(this.value), console.log($( "#AjaxCompanyID" ));
[19:51:41] <Krinkle> And see if they log what you expect
[19:51:53] <gtwy> ok
[19:51:54] <gtwy> good idea
[19:53:02] <DragonPunch> Krinkle you see my solution?
[19:54:25] <gtwy> LOL
[19:54:50] <gtwy> ok i have a totally different problem than i thought
[19:55:06] <gtwy> when i click the <li><a> its actually reloading the page
[19:55:10] <gtwy> so its not calling any js
[19:55:12] <Krinkle> DragonPunch: Sounds good. I'm not sure it'll have an easy user experience, but it should work.
[19:55:35] <Krinkle> gtwy: Aha, the click on <a> bubbles up to the <li>, but since you don't cancel it, the browser follows it.
[19:55:43] <Krinkle> Be sure to call e.preventDefault() at the end of your click() function
[19:56:00] <Krinkle> e=jQuery.Event objet; the first argumetn to the click callback
[19:56:13] <gtwy> e.preventDefault();
[19:56:16] <gtwy> just like that?
[19:56:18] <gtwy> at the end
[19:57:19] <gtwy> that did it. what does the e stand for if you dont mind me asking
[19:58:19] <Krinkle> gtwy: event
[19:59:00] <Krinkle> http://api.jquery.com/click/ uses http://api.jquery.com/on/ passes http://api.jquery.com/Types/#Event
[19:59:14] <Krinkle> http://api.jquery.com/category/events/event-object/
[20:00:23] <gtwy> Uncaught ReferenceError: e is not defined
[20:00:47] <gtwy> it still works
[20:00:51] <gtwy> just noticed that in the console
[20:06:47] <gtwy> boom. got it. thanks guys
[20:07:22] <Devastator> good evening, is there an article explaining folder structure and files of jquery-ui? there are multiple css files, like jquery-ui.css, jquery-ui.min.css, jquery-ui.structure.css etc
[20:10:52] <gtwy> this is amazing
[20:10:59] <gtwy> thank you guys again
[20:17:02] <DragonPunch> Krinkle: http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/editing.html#contenteditable
[20:18:19] <DragonPunch> Krinkle: http://caniuse.com/#search=contenteditable
[20:18:22] <DragonPunch> hardly dated.
[20:21:27] <DragonPunch> Krinkle: Medium.js keeps HTML code withincontenteditableÂ semantic, simple, and clean. Medium.js also supports placeholders, automatic HR (or BR, or P) creation, events, hotkeys, simple & complex element injection, and more!
[20:22:09] <Krinkle> DragonPunch: I've wor with contenteditable profesionally every day and have for the past 3 years. I'm telling you it's a dated technology that is currently being reconsidered by the specification makers.
[20:22:27] <Krinkle> The current implementation in browsers is highly unstable, unpredictable and inconsistent.
[20:22:43] <Krinkle> We use it at Wikipedia internally. And it has to be controlled like a 3 year old.
[20:24:36] <Krinkle> It's an old technology which means that most browsers have gotten around to implementing it to some extend. However don't be fooled by the green boxes on caniuse. Those green boxes indicuate the browsers implement what the spec says.
[20:24:39] <Krinkle> It doesn't mean the spec is good.
[20:26:03] <DragonPunch> Krinkle: Why is MEDIUMJS using it?
[20:26:41] <Krinkle> DragonPunch: Just like we at Wikipedia, they probably realised there isn't an alternative. And in order to get text selection and spell check working on all browsers and mobile devices you have to use content editable.
[20:27:02] <Krinkle> However because the rest of content editable isn't very good, the way to use it is to lock it down and pull off all limbs except the head.
[20:27:09] <Krinkle> and then add better ones on top that are custom made
[20:27:23] <acidjazz> hai guise what does everyone think of this https://github.com/bendc/sprint
[20:27:28] <Krinkle> Medium and Wikipedia aren't using content editable as much as they have no choice but they avoid it as much as possible.
[20:27:37] <acidjazz> Sprint is a high-performance, 5KB (gzipped) DOM library for modern browsers. Sprint notably shines on bandwidth and resource constrained devices such as phones and tablets.
[20:28:44] <DragonPunch> Krinkle: if all i want to use it for is headings...paragraphs..images...will i have issues?
[20:28:52] <DragonPunch> you might be using it a little more advanced at wikipedia there
[20:28:58] <DragonPunch> but i just want to do simple stuff
[20:29:02] <DragonPunch> will there be issues fo rme?
[20:29:08] <Devastator> is my question too basic or to easy to find elsewhere?
[20:29:09] <Krinkle> DragonPunch: If you use it with a standard flag and no close supervision, you will have issues.
[20:29:16] <Krinkle> The less you want, the more trouble it will bring.
[20:32:30] <Krinkle> DragonPunch: I'd recommend looking for an existing library (that may or may not use contenteditable inside) that does what you need.
[20:35:54] <DragonPunch> Krinkle: im going to try contentEditable.
[20:36:12] <DragonPunch> Krinkle: Wikibedia is an edge case.
[20:36:45] <DragonPunch> i googled about it and no one else is saying anything bad about it. i think it would be naive to just 'trust' you.
[20:36:53] <DragonPunch> no offense, i just don't know you
[20:46:46] <Krinkle> DragonPunch: I guess youll have to find out for yourself :)

[20:57:55] <Felishia> whaaat?
[21:01:55] <Felishia> then what the???
[21:01:56] <Felishia> As of jQuery 1.5, all of jQuery's Ajax methods return a superset of the XMLHTTPRequest object. This jQuery XHR object, or "jqXHR," returned by $.get() implements the Promise interface, giving it all the properties, methods, and behavior of a Promise (see Deferred object for more information). The jqXHR.done() (for success), jqXHR.fail() (for error), and jqXHR.always() (for completion, whether success or error) methods take a function argument that is ca
[21:01:56] <Felishia> lled when the request terminates. For information about the arguments this function receives, see the jqXHR Object section of the $.ajax() documentation.

[23:38:26] <luaboy> what is the relation between ajax and jquery ?
[23:39:50] <bepolite> luaboy: Jquery helps you do do ajax calls with ease
[23:39:52] <bepolite> ?learn ajax
[23:40:59] <luaboy> ?learn ajax
[23:41:03] <bepolite> luaboy:  https://learn.jquery.com/ajax/
[23:49:15] <Cork> luaboy: ajax is a term for fetching part of the page and update the page
[23:49:47] <Cork> luaboy: so it has strictly little to do with jquery directly, except that jquery provides some methods to do those calls
[23:56:42] <luaboy> if I .getjson from remote ,how do I parse the json data by key-value pairs?
[23:57:08] <Cork> luaboy: make sure the server say it sends json
