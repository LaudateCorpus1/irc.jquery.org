[00:20:50] <Joey__> so I have a local / intranet webserver that has an online activation thing. When users click on a "..." link in a field the webserver checks if it has internet connectivity and gets an activation code from my server. When the server doesn't have access to internet it shows a QR Code with the url. What would be a nice way to display the activation url to users that don't have a smart phone
[00:20:50] <Joey__> without cluttering the screen? any thoughts? The QR is an img that slidesdown, meaning it zooms from nothing to 100% and in addition its parent div slowly fades in... so I would something nice for the url as well.
[00:52:42] <Joey__> in case anyone cares I think I'll do a sort of this effect when people hover the QR code http://demo.tutorialzine.com/2010/04/simple-banner-rotator-php-mysql-jquery/demo.php
[01:24:40] <alabd> Good day all , when we use jquery $.post('/contact.php',..  in a .js file , to send data to .php file , should php file be run by user to get data??
[01:41:11] <Cork> alabd: that doesn't really make sense
[01:41:29] <Cork> alabd: $.post connects the server and gives the server the url
[01:41:38] <Cork> alabd: that is basically all it does
[01:42:11] <Cork> alabd: if the server identifies that url to point to a script, and it know how to execute it, it will
[01:42:30] <Cork> alabd: and the result of that script executing will be sent back to the browser
[01:42:34] <alabd> Cork: i mean should necessarily $post be in the .php file that will be run
[01:43:08] <Cork> alabd: you mean if it can only call the same resource it was called from?
[01:43:34] <alabd> yes
[01:43:46] <Cork> no, post is post, it can post anywhere
[01:43:55] <Cork> browsers limit ajax to the same domain by default though
[01:44:35] <alabd> Cork: yes post is post , but that .php should be run to get data from $post , yes?
[01:44:54] <Cork> alabd: not sure what you mean by that
[01:45:05] <Cork> alabd: php is server side, and js don't care about that
[01:45:32] <alabd> i mean when ajx send a data to a .php file , how php understand to interept the file while user is not opening it
[01:45:39] <Cork> alabd: what you get back from the server when you call an url is up to the server
[01:45:47] <Cork> alabd: js don't have files
[01:45:54] <Cork> alabd: web don't have files
[01:46:12] <Cork> the server has resource urls, and files it maps to those urls
[01:47:06] <Cork> alabd: but yes if you call an url that on a server is a php file, the php file will be executed
[01:47:13] <alabd> you mean server make php interept .php file and then that page get receieved data
[01:47:18] <Cork> (if the server understands php that is)
[01:47:26] <Cork> alabd: yes
[01:47:45] <Cork> alabd: the webserver hands the post data over to the php script
[01:48:06] <Cork> and then it is up to the php script to do something useful with it
[01:48:14] <alabd> Cork: thanks alot , sorry i dunno a lot about js , i want to copy <script src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.7/jquery.min.js">  in .js file ,how to do it ?
[01:48:39] <alabd>  src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.7/jquery.min.js"
[01:48:42] <Cork> alabd: copy?
[01:48:45] <alabd> use
[01:48:53] <Cork> just put it in the html
[01:49:16] <alabd> i should remove script tags
[01:49:31] <alabd> no that is .js file
[01:49:47] <Cork> alabd: sounds like you should start a web developing base tutorial
[01:50:13] <Cork> cause i feel the basis are missing in your questions
[01:50:14] <alabd> yes , but for now ,what should id do , to call .js file in .js file ,
[01:50:25] <alabd> ?
[01:50:46] <Cork> alabd: your currently starting at step 25, but you haven't done step 5-20
[01:51:02] <Cork> alabd: you need to learn how things stick together
[01:51:47] <Cork> alabd: http://dev.opera.com/articles/view/1-introduction-to-the-web-standards-cur/
[01:52:14] <alabd> yes but i need this for now and nothing more , how to call .js file in a .js file ,
[01:52:25] <Cork> alabd: you don't
[01:52:40] <Cork> alabd: the problem is the concept of your question is all wrong
[01:52:51] <Cork> 1. again web don't have files
[01:52:59] <Cork> 2. you don't load things from php to js
[01:53:09] <Cork> 3. php NEVER talks to js
[01:53:23] <Cork> 3. php generates html and the html is sent to the client
[01:53:26] <Cork> and so on
[01:53:34] <Cork> but again, you NEED to learn the basics
[01:54:38] <alabd> sir that question has been finished , now i have another question ...how to call jquery.min.js in another .js script ,, for example we have include in PHP to include .php files in php files ...
[01:55:32] <Cork> sigh
[01:55:43] <Cork> alabd: i've already answered that
[01:55:45] <Cork> you don't
[01:56:04] <Cork> php is server side, so it just includes things
[01:56:07] <Cork> as it has it locally
[01:56:12] <alabd> Cork: thanks i have found the  answer , http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3991492/include-a-javascript-file-in-a-javascript-file
[01:56:15] <Cork> js and css don't work like that
[01:56:19] <Cork> ...
[01:56:38] <Cork> alabd: that isn't the answer...
[01:56:57] <Cork> alabd: but apparently you don't want to learn
[01:57:58] <alabd> why not ?
[01:58:00] <alabd> function includeJS(incFile) {    document.write('<script type="text/javascript" src="'+ incFile+ '">'); }
[01:58:37] <alabd> Cork: why this does not work ? http://stackoverflow.com/posts/3991513/revisions
[01:58:45] <Cork> alabd: you don't have a clue what that does right?
[01:59:31] <Cork> except for "it loads a js 'file'"
[02:00:29] <alabd> does not it include a js script in another .js file ?
[02:00:48] <Cork> no
[02:01:06] <Cork> cause again web don't have files
[02:01:22] <Cork> and you CAN'T INCLUDE JS IN ANOTHER JS
[02:01:42] <Cork> and again you need to learn how the web works
[02:01:57] <Cork> or you will just create code that won't work
[02:03:53] <alabd1> Cork: sorry dc ,does not it include a js script in another .js file ?
[02:04:07] <Cork> sigh
[02:04:19] <Cork> alabd1: no, it does not
[02:04:39] <Cork> and again learn the basics, this is the last time i'm going to tell you
[02:04:48] <alabd1> so the only way is copying all jquery file in that .js file ...
[02:04:53] <Cork> no
[02:04:59] <alabd1> and another way
[02:05:03] <alabd1> html file
[02:05:08] <alabd1> i can't do that
[02:05:23] <Cork> alabd1: fine do what ever you want
[02:05:53] <alabd1> Cork: in fact i don't know which html call that .js
[02:06:38] <alabd1> anyway thanks
[02:06:55] <alabd1> Cork: sorry if i bother u
[02:07:03] <alabd1> bothered *
[02:13:53] <alabd1> Cork: infact , i have a var  in .js and i want to send it to .php file , how is it possible if i don;t want use jquery and don;t saying me learn javascript for now ?
[02:18:15] <Cork> alabd1: you need to open a connection to the server and send the data over
[02:18:30] <Cork> alabd1: with native js you need to use XMLHttpRequest
[02:33:43] <basiclases> is there a framework which splits a website into four sections? my client wants a video, a slideshow a menu and some other shit in four quarters :D this does not reflect on my personal design tastes
[02:38:47] <alabd1> Cork:  i researched for this a little js work , would you check and say if i say correct or not (because i don't have time to learn js now) , to make it work : here in file https://github.com/sebsauvage/ZeroBin/blob/master/js/zerobin.js , we have a line>  var url = scriptLocation() + "?" + data.id + '#' + randomkey;  .... i want to send this variable to .php file , i think first i should make that variable global , yes ?or is it global now ?
[03:10:46] <lombrozo> Can anyone please tell my why my simple javascript/jquery animation is so choppy/unresponsive on my nexus 7?  http://conjugator.cdudigital.com/student/map
[03:18:10] <alabd> Cork: sorry dc , did i do it correct ? http://sebsauvage.net/paste/?d311e3d6714a8f1a#cqNmUA+D2ho6LL9XlHqA4BDIVmwlvStGamLmTyMWuic=
[03:49:11] <davide> halo to all! I don't know if I am in the right place to ask how to create a plugin with static in it. I want to create something like the famous validator: it has a function to add new methods. There is a standard way to do this?
[05:04:57] <slikts> are there any alternative implementations of jquery?
[05:29:15] <pld> hey, in this snippet, how would i go about updating the text everytime the input changes? http://bpaste.net/show/189107/
[05:31:07] <sirecote> $(input[name=file]).on('change', ...)
[05:34:17] <pld> since i click the button, how would that look? .on("click", val())?
[05:35:34] <sirecote> http://jsfiddle.net/7kGGU/ something like that
[05:36:46] <pld> sirecote: thanks!

[06:57:47] <gp5st> is anyone here using flot? is there a way to force it to show all xlabels?
[06:58:23] <marandi> hi , can anyone help me with this sidebar action ? http://www.wacom.com/en/de/\
[06:58:28] <marandi> hi , can anyone help me with this sidebar action ? http://www.wacom.com/en/de/
[06:59:03] <beancurd> marandi: what about it?
[07:00:14] <marandi> beancurd: i dunno how to design a sidebar like this one  , i mean i know its 2-stage div , that the one collapse and behind of it show , or something like this ! is there any jquery plugin like this ?!
[07:01:23] <decx> jesus it's terrible, what is wacom thinking
[07:02:11] <decx> if you really want something like this, it's not that hard to make yourself
[07:02:55] <decx> but the ux is aweful. why would you change the main menu appearance on hover
[07:03:14] <beancurd> decx: they're thinking 'holy crap, we're becoming more and more irrelevant as each day passes'
[07:03:19] <beancurd> heh
[07:03:59] <beancurd> marandi: you just described how it could be done.
[07:04:27] <marandi>  beancurd : i know , but i cant manage it , and it mess with my head really hard
[07:04:30] <cannap> wow this is cool
[07:04:31] <cannap> :D
[07:04:32] <decx> "we're not worried that smartphones pushing down the prices for components ruin the scheme of our overpriced shit"
[07:04:46] <cannap> lets make a plugin for this :D
[07:05:03] <decx> it's distracting
[07:06:32] <beancurd> hmmm...
[07:07:04] <beancurd> lets see.
[07:10:11] <cannap> what is thi big wacom hiden input field with this big code?
[07:16:41] <|RicharD|> hi
[07:34:21] <mehrdad> hey Cork
[07:34:38] <mehrdad> do you remember this fiddle of yours ? http://jsfiddle.net/pBtyx/2/
[07:35:00] <mehrdad> the same code for <tr> is not working at all
[07:39:28] <m1chael> i'm using jquery mobile 1.4.2 ... autocomplete. i've found some kind of bug that creates two <form elements nested within eachother in a <ul... http://infobuzz.me/add-sighting/ # the problem is, once the Autocomplete is filled in, the value is never posted as a hidden value or anything. you can see the values POSTed by looking at the Request Information in the error report. someone told me the
[07:39:28] <m1chael> form should be posting as an ajax form. i'm so confused at this. can anyone help me figure this out?
[07:50:41] <mehrdad> swap() doesn't work either
[07:50:48] <mehrdad> only the first move
[08:02:51] <decx> what's wrong with tha mehrdad should work fine
[08:03:07] <decx> ul becomes tr, li becomes td, wrap in table, works
[08:03:58] <lima_web_> hi, how do you select an element who contains certains words ? http://jsfiddle.net/WakyV/
[08:05:04] <decx> you're already doing it
[08:07:07] <lima_web_> decx, I mean, who countains word "this" and word "that" in a sentence or in a text, like if I was doing %this% AND %that% in sql
[08:07:41] <decx> i dont know if the contains selector can do match, but filter can
[08:08:30] <lima_web_> ok thanks gonna try
[08:08:47] <decx> $('#myparent').find('a').filter( function() { return howeveritworkstofiltertext.match(regexmagic)}
[08:09:05] <decx> this.innerText probably
[08:09:55] <decx> or textContent
[08:09:57] <lima_web_> ok, thank you
[08:10:12] <systemfault> lima_web_: You can probably use :contains 2 times
[08:10:23] <systemfault> If you want to check the presence of two words.
[08:11:11] <decx> that must be a giant overhead to run that two times
[08:11:25] <decx> i guess the contains selector just uses filter behind the scenes anyway
[08:11:53] <systemfault> contains is crap, it should not even exists...
[08:12:25] <systemfault> Coupling your JS to the content and not the structure of your document is poor practice.
[08:13:43] <lima_web_> hum it does excatly what I want : Description: Select all elements that contain the specified text.
[08:14:56] <m1chael> i'm using jquery mobile 1.4.2 ... autocomplete. i've found some kind of bug that creates two <form elements nested within eachother in a <ul... http://infobuzz.me/add-sighting/ # the problem is, once the Autocomplete is filled in, the value is never posted as a hidden value or anything. you can see the values POSTed by looking at the Request Information in the error report. someone told me the
[08:14:57] <m1chael> form should be posting as an ajax form. i'm so confused at this. can anyone help me figure this out?
[08:15:01] <decx> it does use filter https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/c8c32f1d0583711355c593fb4c84332bfba18254/speed/jquery-basis.js#L3190
[08:15:14] <decx> return (elem.textContent || elem.innerText || getText([ elem ]) || "").indexOf(match[3]) >= 0;
[08:16:55] <lima_web_> yep you totally right, decx ^^
[08:26:56] <mehrdad> i'm really tired of programming
[08:27:17] <mehrdad> fiddling with this controld and that control from .net and js etc
[08:27:39] <beancurd> .net might be your problem.
[08:27:44] <mehrdad> it's Exhausting
[08:28:13] <mehrdad> no, it's everything, .net is actually not bad as the rules are mostly clear
[08:28:22] <mehrdad> but css and js are major headaches
[08:28:39] <systemfault> mehrdad: It's okay... every programmer has considered at least once... just say fuck it and do something else... like becoming  a farmer.
[08:28:40] <mehrdad> all in all, yeah... it's the sum of all
[08:29:27] <mehrdad> lol, exactly what i some times think of
[08:29:44] <mehrdad> but that's just about it, it's a thought, a fad
[08:29:57] <beancurd> mehrdad: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pDTiFkXgEE
[08:30:02] <mehrdad> interesting that you mentioned farming though
[08:30:16] <mehrdad> at work, will watch it when i get back home
[08:30:25] <beancurd> heh.
[08:30:42] <mehrdad> what's it about ?
[08:30:53] <beancurd> 1:30min clip. about farming.
[08:30:57] <mehrdad> lol
[08:31:11] <mehrdad> so this is serious talking
[08:31:23] <beancurd> totally srs.
[08:31:33] <mehrdad> i want to become a cowboy and ride on my horse
[08:31:42] <mehrdad> and delve into the fields
[08:31:55] <beancurd> programming is fantastic, as annoying as it is, nothing else lets you create stuff as easily.
[08:31:56] <mehrdad> and see the native americans hunting
[08:32:00] <beancurd> stuffffffff
[08:32:06] <decx> had the same feeling as a designer and went into more programming
[08:32:10] <beancurd> natic americans hunt?
[08:32:13] <beancurd> ve
[08:32:18] <mehrdad> yep
[08:32:35] <mehrdad> yeah, that's true, it's a very creative process
[08:32:48] <beancurd> that's kind of mean :/
[08:32:57] <beancurd> i mean... we have supermarkets now..
[08:33:03] <mehrdad> lol
[08:33:10] <beancurd> and then we make them live in reservations and hunt :/
[08:33:14] <mehrdad> just a trip back into time
[08:33:40] <mehrdad> no, that's their way of life
[08:33:53] <mehrdad> that's what satisfies them the most, the nature
[08:34:12] <beancurd> i think given the choice, most of them would probably want to live in modern society.. assuming we're talking about northern native americans..
[08:34:30] <decx> that's a ridiculous generalization
[08:34:42] <beancurd> south americas, i can understand, there's really nothing else to do in the deep amazon.
[08:34:53] <decx> i'm sure there are many native americans who just want to play videogames and hang out in #jquery
[08:35:08] <beancurd> decx: they're probably some here now!
[08:35:10] <mehrdad> well that's what comes to my mind when talking about native americans, the amazon kind of native
[08:35:51] <beancurd> oh, right, yeah, then it's a little different, they have no choice but to hang out in the amazon, because the cities of brazil can get a littly stabby.
[08:36:27] <mehrdad> i gotta pack up and go home , sorry
[08:36:27] <lima_web_> 3
[08:36:29] <beancurd> but eh, if it was the USA, i'd be casinos and welfare all the way into healthcare and capitalism yo.
[08:36:52] <mehrdad> peace out
[08:49:37] <lima_web_> programming is like surfing, 80% swimming, 20% trying to surf
[09:04:07] <DeltaHeavy> lima_web_: I thnk you got that the wrong way around :p
[09:25:29] <forgmdos> hey
[09:25:52] <forgmdos> anyone's able to help me applying fitVids()  to an object ?
[09:37:57] <decx> what's your problem with it
[09:38:11] <forgmdos> it gets applied but doesn't work
[09:41:50] <decx> i know i used it at some point, but the page look like it just uses the css hack for "responsive" iframes and embeds
[09:46:42] <decx> check it out http://jsfiddle.net/decx/4x7CQ/ forgmdos
[10:00:47] <forgmdos> yes i can make it work with yt
[10:00:55] <forgmdos> but not with -abject'
[10:01:00] <forgmdos> *object
[10:01:09] <forgmdos> I made a fiddle, if you want to have a look http://jsfiddle.net/E9fLj/
[10:02:04] <forgmdos> resizing the sidebar, the blue buttons SHOULD move down, but they don't:  the object  grows only in width, so the fitVids is not working
[10:04:11] <decx> well yeah because that hack doesnt work with all the extra stuff you wrote into the #videocontainer css
[10:04:53] <decx> without fitvids: http://jsfiddle.net/decx/E9fLj/1/
[10:12:54] <lombrozo> Can anyone please tell my why my simple javascript/jquery animation is so choppy/unresponsive on my nexus 7?  http://conjugator.cdudigital.com/student/map
[10:15:10] <forgmdos> all that stuff is the embedding code of justin.tv
[10:15:30] <forgmdos> so you simply removed fitvids and it worked?
[10:16:02] <forgmdos> Impossible :O i've already tried that one, the player remained small.... you must have changed something else
[10:16:17] <decx> forgmdos i also removed max-height and other stuff from the #videocontainer css and added padding-bottom
[10:16:26] <decx> that's not how that hack works
[10:16:46] <decx> lombrozo is it supposed to look like this? http://i.imgur.com/I8N6rWP.png
[10:19:31] <decx> you're switching opacity between 3 map_river pngs to animate the river. that will always have terrible performance
[10:20:08] <decx> bar some serious optimization, this will only run acceptable on desktops
[10:22:02] <decx> if you have to use html for this i suggest you put your river into one big spritesheet and move its background-position with a keyframe animation
[10:23:07] <decx> that way you get rid of the constant repaints
[10:23:31] <forgmdos> decx:why padding-bottom:60% ?
[10:23:58] <decx> it gives the absolutely positioned element inside an area to fill with its 100% height/width rule
[10:23:59] <forgmdos> without it, it gets hidden going too near to the top
[10:24:30] <decx> the padding bottom is the ratio of the video
[10:24:42] <forgmdos> seriously?
[10:24:42] <decx> so a video that is 640x480 would have padding-bottom: 75%
[10:24:48] <forgmdos> why?
[10:25:00] <decx> because 480 is 75% of 640
[10:25:05] <forgmdos> I thought padding was simply the distance between the side of the element and its content
[10:25:23] <decx> yeah but the iframe/embed/object is positioned absolutely
[10:25:33] <decx> so it will use the space that its parent element gives it
[10:26:19] <forgmdos> lol i seriously don't understand this one.
[10:26:23] <forgmdos> thank you for the solution anyway
[10:26:27] <decx> it's a hack
[10:26:29] <decx> ;)
[10:26:30] <forgmdos> i'll have to study this trick
[10:27:04] <decx> fitvids probably just check the video ratio and appends the right padding-bottom to the parent
[10:28:06] <forgmdos> i thought it modified derectly its height ^_^
[10:28:43] <decx> that would be expensive
[10:29:31] <forgmdos> in terms of operations/sec
[10:29:33] <forgmdos> ?
[10:30:20] <decx> more expensive than doing nothing else on resize at least :>
[10:33:05] <PhonicUK> If I do a $.post, will {data} end up in the post data, or as part of the query string?
[10:35:04] <systemfault> PhonicUK: Part of the post data.
[10:35:09] <systemfault> That how HTTP works.
[10:36:23] <lombrozo> decx: I changed the opacity to a simple display:block/none - but performance still chopps?
[10:38:39] <PhonicUK> systemfault, I need to talk to a service that takes parameters both in the post data and as the query string
[10:38:59] <PhonicUK> trying to figure the best way of handling it
[10:39:09] <systemfault> PhonicUK: That shouldn't be possible but... you could build the query string into the url
[10:39:15] <PhonicUK> aye
[10:39:24] <systemfault> Tell your backend he should learn how to do his job.
[10:39:45] <PhonicUK> well the backend is actually being abused for something its not meant to do
[10:40:06] <PhonicUK> the backend service is just an API endpoint, it was never built to allow file uploads
[10:40:28] <systemfault> I see...
[10:40:57] <PhonicUK> but the file uploads are being done via the API because the API has a well established security model
[10:40:59] <systemfault> it's just that usually... you would use GET to read stuff from your server... and POST to write to it.
[10:41:04] <PhonicUK> aye
[10:41:15] <systemfault> But I understand the constraint
[10:41:41] <shoky> $.param could be helpful
[10:41:59] <PhonicUK> I'm wondering if the backend can be told to accept all arguments regardless of whether they're in the post or the query string
[10:42:17] <PhonicUK> and then just do this particular call as POST entirely
[10:43:09] <PhonicUK> thinking of API endpoints, you guys ever used WCF/AJAX with Jquery?
[10:43:17] <PhonicUK> it works so rediculously well its awesome
[10:43:44] <systemfault> I tend to avoid the MS stack :P
[10:44:09] <PhonicUK> they've done a good job of making it 'just work'
[10:48:17] <lombrozo> Can anyone please tell my why my simple javascript/jquery animation is so choppy/unresponsive on my nexus 7?  http://conjugator.cdudigital.com/student/map
[10:49:20] <PhonicUK> lombrozo, overlaying images like that is expensive
[10:49:31] <lombrozo> PhonicUK - really?
[10:49:40] <PhonicUK> yes, also you're wasting a lot of pixels
[10:49:59] <PhonicUK> each element you've got like the house and the building are the size of the full area with just a small area actually populated
[10:50:10] <lombrozo> PhonicUK - yes...
[10:50:17] <lombrozo> PhonicUK - that's bad?
[10:50:28] <PhonicUK> yes, it means more calculations need going
[10:50:29] <PhonicUK> *doing
[10:50:33] <PhonicUK> you should crop all the images down and positioning them
[10:50:35] <jop008> Hi I want to check  to see if the collapsible set has children with text if not it must hide itself. My oelall variable has length 0 instead of what I expect http://jsfiddle.net/M8HFc/8/
[10:50:54] <lombrozo> PhonicUK - so if I just overlaid the small populated part only - that'd speed things up?
[10:51:01] <PhonicUK> yes
[10:51:15] <PhonicUK> also I think its not working right for me
[10:51:17] <PhonicUK> most of it is grey
[10:51:25] <lombrozo> PhonicUK - I did it like that so I could turn on/off layers - and they'd scale to fit all the other layers exactly
[10:51:25] <PhonicUK> no errors though
[10:51:34] <lombrozo> (ignoe the grey bit)
[10:51:53] <shoky> it's just a choppy 3 frame animation.. no?
[10:51:59] <PhonicUK> you can still keep separate layers, but just crop them to the relevant areas
[10:52:07] <PhonicUK> shoky, he has performance issues on a mobile device
[10:52:07] <lombrozo> shoky - no, it's generally unresponsive
[10:52:30] <shoky> it doesn't seem to perform well on a desktop either...
[10:52:37] <decx> like i said, you can get better performance if you put your animation not in 3 separate img, but one big background sprite with a background-position animation
[10:52:38] <lombrozo> PhonicUK - when you press the start button, even that is slow to respond
[10:53:07] <PhonicUK> lombrozo, doesn't supprise me
[10:53:10] <lombrozo> decx: u talking about HTML5 sprites?
[10:53:18] <lombrozo> PhonicUK - why?
[10:53:23] <decx> nothing html5 about spritesheets, but yes :>
[10:53:34] <PhonicUK> lombrozo, as soon as you press it, it has to start rendering all those overlayed images
[10:53:42] <lombrozo> PhonicUK - I see
[10:53:59] <PhonicUK> also sprites would be a good idea for the animated bit
[10:54:03] <PhonicUK> although thats trickier to scale
[10:54:10] <lombrozo> animated bit?
[10:54:14] <PhonicUK> the animated water
[10:54:19] <lombrozo> yeah, ok
[10:54:21] <jop008> Is this done correctly oelall = oel.filter (".divinfo, .tb5"); ? In this http://jsfiddle.net/M8HFc/8/
[10:54:38] <lombrozo> PhonicUK - ok will look at this sprites thing
[10:54:45] <lombrozo> decx: thanks for the info
[10:54:49] <PhonicUK> jop008, your variable names are terrible
[10:54:50] <lombrozo> PhonicUK - thanks
[10:55:10] <PhonicUK> although I suspect thats because its not english xD
[10:55:11] <jop008> Thanks fellow
[10:55:22] <PhonicUK> I can't actually tell what's going on though
[10:55:41] <jop008> Let's keep it prrofessional and not try to put another person down
[10:55:59] <PhonicUK> don't take it personally :P
[10:56:30] <PhonicUK> I can't tell if your variable names are either non-english, or just indescriptive
[10:56:39] <PhonicUK> but if you've got english comments I'd expect the code to follow
[10:56:58] <PhonicUK> also you should use "var", you're currently putting things in the global scope
[10:58:32] <PhonicUK> it is something of a failing of IRC that you can't communicate tone of voice xD
[11:13:09] <jop008> used this var oelall = oel.find(".divinfo, .tb5");
[11:23:26] <decx> i cant tell what's going on with jqmobile html, is there even anything with a data role collapsible-set in there jop008 ?
[11:27:53] <jop008> I find it out thanks anyway
[11:31:20] <pld> tomorrow is sunday
[11:32:35] <giuscri> What if I need to do some webscraping with jQuery? How can I import the page I need to scape?
[11:33:47] <giuscri> More general, anyone already tried to do webscraping via jQuery?
[11:34:43] <systemfault> giuscri: You can't.
[11:35:48] <lombrozo> PhonicUK - So I've updated it to use a 'sprite' with background-position animation - still slow...
[11:36:24] <giuscri> systemfault: uhm. I'm trying to explain my project: I'd like to write a FirefoxOS application that scrapes (real-time) the schedules from a train-company
[11:36:36] <lombrozo> decx - So I've updated it to use a 'sprite' with background-position animation - still slow...
[11:37:08] <giuscri> systemfault: I came up with the idea of using jQuery since I heard it was easier to write stuff with it.
[11:37:18] <giuscri> systemfault: what do you think about it?
[11:37:55] <systemfault> giuscri: If it's executed in a context different than the one from a browser, it should be possible.
[11:38:14] <giuscri> systemfault: why?
[11:38:38] <systemfault> giuscri: What you want to do is impossible to do in a browser because of the same-origin policy restriction
[11:38:56] <decx> check out node.js if you want to do serverside stuff with js
[11:39:18] <giuscri> decx: I cannot use node.js on FirefoxOS
[11:39:47] <giuscri> decx: I have to use Javascript
[11:39:56] <decx> oh sorry didnt read that
[11:40:02] <giuscri> decx: ...and HTML+CSS
[11:40:06] <systemfault> giuscri: A firefoxos application probably has more privilege than a normal browser
[11:40:08] <decx> no idea what ffos entails
[11:49:34] <decx> lombrozo a complex scene like that will need a lot more work to make it performant on tablets
[11:49:48] <decx> your river is doing a crazy dance
[12:00:50] <TiMike> hello
[12:02:04] <TiMike> wondering if there is a way to transform a time like "2014-03-14T00:30:00.000Z"  to something readable like:   3pm
[12:03:59] <tw2113> maybe this can help you TiMike http://www.hunlock.com/blogs/Javascript_Dates-The_Complete_Reference
[12:04:21] <tw2113> also http://www.quackit.com/javascript/javascript_date_and_time_functions.cfm
[12:04:40] <TiMike> tw2113: thank you, will peep it
[12:09:53] <_bart> TiMike, I also recommend http://momentjs.com/
[12:14:26] <TiMike> _bart: i have seen that recently, trying to avoid a library if i can
[12:15:02] <TiMike> _bart: it is pretty small though, Ill check it
[12:22:52] <tw2113> why avoid a library if it gets the job done
[12:22:58] <tw2113> especially a small one
[12:25:38] <tw2113> if you're using something like grunt, you can get them concatenated into one file and minimized together
[12:25:42] <tw2113> saving yourself an http hit
[13:20:33] <m6> Is there some better way to learn the ins and outs of jQuery besides browsing through API reference?
[13:21:42] <m6> ah, sorry, just looked at the topic..
[13:23:20] <ManyouRisms> watcha mean ins and outs?
[13:24:08] <m6> ManyouRisms: Basically I can't do anything besides .click() and .append() just now
[13:24:33] <tw2113> i'd read the jquery docs
[13:24:38] <tw2113> not the jquery source code
[13:24:41] <m6> I'm getting to be "ok" at vanilla javascript and learning jQuery will be next logical step, I think
[13:24:49] <tw2113> docs will provide examples of useage for various things
[13:24:57] <tw2113> not how they work internally
[13:25:29] <m6> tw2113: Yeah, I'm just learning usage for now :)
[13:25:56] <ManyouRisms> the course on codeacademy is a good start
[13:26:19] <ManyouRisms> i'm not sure you get the 'ins and outs' but it makes you familiar with some of the common functions
[13:26:34] <m6> ManyouRisms: thanks, I'll check them out
[13:26:42] <ManyouRisms> :)
[13:39:50] <telly> can i set the content-type on $.post without providing a success function before the "json" parameter? or how can i use .done() if i have to?
[13:45:47] <telly> oh it works, but if the content type is json i dont need parseJSON it seems
[13:50:45] <davidsharer> ;
[13:59:15] <nodeworks1> anyone familiar with Phery?

[15:36:17] <damaya> Hi all, I am using a jquery plugin, and that plugin's API has a call for context menu. I was wanting to write my own extension of this plugin. Basically, instantiate X plugin, then do a $('#id').myfunction( params ) and it'd use the instantiated X plugin (extend it). That doesn't make a lot of sense probably, but I was wondering if anyone can point me in the right direction with my vague description.
[15:36:35] <zcfrtvnhju> hi
[15:36:42] <zcfrtvnhju> is there any public log for this chan?
[15:37:10] <mikeche1en> can anyone see why clicking the search results does not trigger the click function? test with a search term like "fern" http://jsfiddle.net/XpHJN/
[15:43:40] <mikeche1en> nm i fixed it :D
[16:07:16] <ankurk__> I have a question, why is it always recommended to send data in data part in an Ajax call?
[16:11:13] <systemfault> ankurk__: How else would you do it for POST?
[16:11:24] <systemfault> Unless I misunderstand the question
[16:12:12] <ankurk__> I was actually reading jquery best practices, it said that we should not send data as parameters.
[16:13:08] <systemfault> ankurk__: You mean?
[16:13:31] <ankurk__> I mean as parameter values.
[16:14:41] <systemfault> ankurk__: For GET requests?
[16:14:49] <systemfault> I'm trying to understand what you mean.
[16:15:11] <ankurk__> Let me find that line
[16:15:56] <ankurk__> DO NOT put request parameters in the URL, send them using data object setting.
[16:16:05] <systemfault> Ah
[16:16:22] <systemfault> It's because jQuery will properly escape the parameters.
[16:16:39] <systemfault> It's usually for GET requests
[16:16:59] <ankurk__> Oh okay
[16:17:05] <ankurk__> Sorry to confuse you
[16:17:14] <systemfault> It's okay :)
[16:17:20] <mouses> whats the standard for page width nowadays? i want to embed a 1280x720 youtube video on my page
[16:17:32] <mouses> my current setup is 980px width
[16:17:40] <mouses> i'm thinking of doing 1400px
[16:19:57] <mouses> dude
[16:20:06] <systemfault> mouses: The "recommended size" is still around 1000px... because of tablets.
[16:20:24] <systemfault> mouses: The best, if you can... is to do a responsive design.
[16:20:26] <mouses> but tablets will downscale by default right?
[16:20:38] <systemfault> mouses: tablets will zoom.
[16:20:59] <mouses> yeah zoom, like phones
[16:21:13] <systemfault> zoom != responsive though
[16:21:24] <mouses> responsive would be nice, but i have some complex math
[16:21:36] <mouses> probably wouldnt be worth it to make it responsive
[16:21:43] <systemfault> Ah ok :)
[16:21:51] <mouses> i'd have to change my sliding thumbnails and images into fading images
[16:22:39] <mouses> what about 1350px?
[16:22:42] <mouses> width
[16:22:47] <mouses> not too bad, right?
[16:23:10] <systemfault> Those on tablets might have to zoom... you decide
[16:29:59] <mouses> i'm going with a 1280px width to match the youtube embed
[16:30:20] <systemfault> :)
[16:30:35] <mouses> thx tho
[16:55:09] <Tomashe> hey guys
[16:55:22] <Tomashe> wondering ho9w can i do somehting liek that " if ("1234567890".indexOf(chr) < 0) { " but to if (tab press
[17:04:40] <Tomashe> $('input').on("keypress", function(e) {	var keycode = e.keyCode;    if (keycode == 9) {		}}); < anyone knowswhy this isnt working :/
[17:04:49] <Tomashe> it sjust not recognize the TAB press
[17:08:40] <DoctorMonocular> hey everyone
[17:09:02] <DoctorMonocular> I'm trying to figure out if jquery.validations can validate that a date is inside a range?
[17:09:21] <DoctorMonocular> I can check the format with dateISO, but what if I want the date to be in the past, for example?
[17:11:36] <Hyperking> Can someone help? this form data isn't posting as it should using .ajax
[17:11:39] <Hyperking> http://bpaste.net/show/DHpPefo1NaS4RLEsxl5n/
[17:12:06] <Hyperking> my alert isn't displaying either. not sure what im missing
[17:14:17] <shoky> Hyperking: http://bpaste.net/show/dtLfn4UVAQLwnH0dyBMJ/
[17:15:27] <Hyperking> shoky: thanks, but can you explain what you did? not that savvy with jquery
[17:15:51] <Hyperking> var name and email are objects now??
[17:16:05] <shoky> Hyperking: changed .click to .submit,  added the 'e' event argument, called e.preventDefault(), made the data object proper
[17:16:08] <shoky> no..
[17:16:12] <shoky> data is an object
[17:16:31] <Hyperking> why name: name ??
[17:16:53] <shoky> you put the name value in a var called name
[17:17:17] <shoky> i want to create a data object with a "name" key that has that name var's value
[17:18:17] <shoky> Hyperking you can also just use .serialize  http://bpaste.net/show/bNx1rGgIHfbJjp1NM6HU/
[17:20:26] <Hyperking> so 'name:' is arbitrary like could foo: name work?
[17:20:27] <Tomashe> shoky: did u see my issue?
[17:20:51] <Tomashe> $('input').on("keypress", function(e) {	var keycode = e.keyCode;    if (keycode == 9) {		}}); < anyone knowswhy this isnt working :/
[17:20:53] <shoky> Hyperking: yeah, but that would mean your POST param would be called "foo" instead of "name"
[17:20:56] <Hyperking> shoky: thanks for the serialize part. that was my next concern
[17:21:02] <shoky> Tomashe: use keydown or keyup
[17:21:09] <Hyperking> i see
[17:21:56] <Hyperking> shoky: so variables can't call other variables ??
[17:22:04] <Tomashe> tyhanks man
[17:22:06] <shoky> what does that even mean..
[17:23:27] <Hyperking> lol.. can a var pets = var1 , var2;
[17:23:42] <shoky> wat?
[17:24:58] <Hyperking> shoky: why not use .click? why .submit?
[17:25:09] <shoky> forms get submitted, not clicked
[17:25:30] <shoky> and even if you meant to handle the submit button's click, it's still better to handle the form's submit
[17:25:45] <shoky> cause there are other things than a click that could submit it
[17:26:36] <Hyperking> hmm interesting, could i submit data without a "form"?
[17:26:49] <shoky> via ajax? sure
[17:27:13] <Hyperking> any drawbacks since its not wrapped in a <form></form>
[17:27:54] <shoky> well, you wouldn't have a submit event with no form
[17:28:27] <shoky> you'd have to have a click event, and a keypress event if you want enter key to submit it too, etc.
[17:28:37] <shoky> but no big drawback
[17:28:53] <shoky> it's prefectly fine to not have a <form>
[17:29:21] <Hyperking> shoky: aha! i see. thanks for the explaination. could I use data inside a dom element
[17:29:37] <shoky> having a form can also make it work when js is disabled
[17:29:50] <shoky> if its set up right
[17:30:00] <shoky> data inside a dom element? what do you mean
[17:30:09] <shoky> could you submit that data? sure
[17:30:24] <Hyperking> html5 has a feature called "contenteditiable" so when a "click" is triggered it sends the data to a file
[17:30:51] <shoky> you can send whatever you want in an ajax request, it's up to you
[17:31:16] <Hyperking> thats spiffy!
[17:31:24] <Hyperking> shoky: thanks shoky
[17:31:34] <shoky> np
[17:32:40] <superjacaman> hey guy i've a jquery ui question can someone hep me?
[17:32:56] <Hyperking> again, e.preventDefault simply disables default form submission
[17:33:08] <shoky> yeah
[17:33:46] <superjacaman> i'm using sortable and i need to not allow the user to drop an element when the connected list have a element
[17:34:36] <superjacaman> i've to call the revert when this happens or something like that
[17:57:27] <poolson> http://pastebin.com/7bLrcCU2
[17:57:34] <poolson> hey dudes ... can someone tell me whats going on here.  the data that gets passed back represents the state of the form when it first loads.  NOT when the form is submitted
[17:57:43] <poolson> how can i make it serialize the data in the form AFTER the submit is initiated
[19:58:28] <wethu> Hey, Im trying to keep a focus event from being lost when the element gets updated, I've tried $(element).focus $(element).bind $(element).on("focus" function() {} Ive looked around, and found that wrapping a div around the element which doesn't get updated could be a solution, is there a better one ?
[20:26:52] <wethu> http://jsfiddle.net/8vvLa/ How can i make the behaviour persist after you select "one" and change your mind and select the text field again?
[20:37:16] <jenia> hello.
[20:38:18] <LoneStar99> is anyone able to access --> https://www.pozr.in ??
[20:38:53] <jenia> can someone please tell me, you know when you submit a form, the form is encoded as {name : value} pairs that arrive at your server
[20:39:23] <LoneStar99> send it via ajax
[20:39:24] <jenia> can i create a string (from a form) when doing an asynchronous call
[20:39:57] <jenia> yes. but then I have to format the string myself. can it be done automtically with jquery?
[20:40:47] <LoneStar99> jenia: you want to automatically create like a json string to send to server?
[20:41:13] <jenia> yea.
[20:41:16] <beancurd> hey lonestar99, that site dead.
[20:41:43] <beancurd> so dead.
[20:41:45] <beancurd> http://www.downforeveryoneorjustme.com/www.pozr.in
[20:42:01] <jenia> data : JSON.stringify(data),
[20:42:02] <jenia> like that?
[20:43:54] <LoneStar99> jenia: that looks right, but i usually send plain POST values to server....

[21:08:06] <axilaris> hi guys... is there a way to modify this so that when ever it opens the modal window, it clears the text input value ? http://bootstrap2modaldemo.scripting.com/#

[21:15:39] <LoneStar99> brb need to restart computer
[22:05:20] <axsuul> for something like $(document).on('click', 'input', function() { .. })
[22:05:38] <axsuul> how can I do it like $(document).on('click', $('input'), function() { ... } ) ?
[22:12:16] <LoneStar99> axsuul: what you trying to do?
[22:19:25] <axsuul> use a jquery object instead of a selector
[22:22:35] <Thoams> Is there a specific jqueryui channel, or is this my best bet...?
[22:25:08] <LoneStar99> axsuul: yeah i think i used that once let me look at some old code

[22:37:50] <beancurd> why does nodejs have a line through it?
[22:40:15] <LoneStar99> beancurd: cuss that service is still not yet released... but that will be a surprise
[22:40:16] <iSDP> could i use a $.ajax request to serve a download by sending the bytes back?
[22:41:23] <LoneStar99> wasted 12 hours migrating a web server and dealing with load-balancing, auto-scale, and cname/ A misconfigs
[22:43:00] <LoneStar99> was gona release chrooted node.js accounts, but scratched that to much work for some very temp... so will be releasing full VPS specifically for Node.js =)
[22:43:35] <beancurd> neat.
[22:44:22] <LoneStar99> in chrooted accounts, there where issues with downloading npm, and it was becoming  a mess... so now will work on a more robust solution
