[03:41:27] <nightcabbage> hello everyone
[03:42:22] <nightcabbage> I have a question.. I'm using .hide(1000) and .show(1000) to animate between hiding and showing a div... but the moment I either animation begins, the height of the element increases by about 15px, and I can't tell why
[03:43:12] <nightcabbage> I even did some console logs... before the .hide, the height is 161. the moment I call hide, it's 177, and in the complete callback, it's 177
[03:43:20] <nightcabbage> anyone have any idea what's going on?
[03:49:58] <nightcabbage> dead channel?
[03:50:00] <nightcabbage> oki... :(
[04:28:55] <Assault_> hi
[04:32:01] <Assault_> Im trying to get JSON data for some charts in a for loop with getJSON(). Problem is if I just reference the i variable in the callback, its value is already 2 (the for loop has finished). So how can I access the current value of i in the callback, or is this even possible?
[04:32:30] <Assault_> im trying to pass the i to the callback so it knows to which div to render, so i have div0 and div1
[04:32:35] <Assault_> so the for loop does 2 cycles
[04:33:13] <Assault_> im new to JS and Jquery btw, so my thinking can be totally wrong...any guidance would be appreciated
[05:18:20] <jomofcw> Using jQuery UI, is there a way to know the result of the collision detection ? e.g. I want to know if my tooltip is positionned at his default position (bottom left+15) or to another (on the top of the element, on the right,...) because of collision.
[05:33:16] <jomofcw> The answer to my question is : use the "using" callback of position thing.

[05:54:49] <jsnoob> Hi
[06:06:47] <BorgCuba> Hi, I have a problem with the order event handlers get called. I have defined a "resizestop" handler and there is a jquery-ui resizable stop handler (gridstack.js). My handler gets called first and the stop handler 2nd. The stop handler is supposed to trigger the 'resizestop' event but that never happens. Here is a jsfiddle: https://jsfiddle.net/2uxpbt6y/4/
[06:11:28] <BorgCuba> If you put a breakpoint on gridstack.js:1101 and on $('.grid-stack-item').on('resizestop', function () .. you can see it
[06:11:44] <BorgCuba> any idea whats wrong here?
[06:18:16] <jomofcw> I'm trying to use the "classes" options in jQuery UI, but I'm not able to get it working. Just doing something like "$element.tooltip({classes{'ui-tooltip':'myClasses'}});".
[06:27:44] <Babcom> hello there
[06:29:07] <Babcom> I need a little help please : here is my jquery code :http://pastebin.com/NMS4PXTU
[06:29:33] <Babcom> I'd like to add some class to my counter but I really don't know how to do it
[06:36:42] <Starburst> Do you want to add a class to the element that has .countdown?
[06:37:19] <Babcom> hi Starburst, no I want to add a class to the element inside strftime
[06:37:38] <Babcom> but when I do that, all the string is displayed
[06:37:56] <Babcom> here is my countdown : http://iccel.impactcentrechretien.com/accueil/
[06:39:20] <Starburst> inside your function, $(this).addClass should work fine
[06:40:17] <Babcom> ok thx for the tip
[06:40:24] <Babcom> Iam a rookie on this :)
[06:40:34] <Starburst> np yw
[06:46:32] <Babcom> Starburst ths a lot ! it worked
[06:46:40] <Babcom> thx*
[06:46:59] <Starburst> nice!

[07:53:30] <_eddy> hi guys. anyone use the formvalidation? i want to know if i can add an if statement like this http://kopy.io/cvx44
[07:57:07] <CRCinAU> ok, so I have a script that does a traceroute from the shell - and it outputs the lines as they come
[07:57:24] <CRCinAU> I'm doing a .ajax query from a page to grab this script and display it in the browser.
[07:57:55] <CRCinAU> I'm wondering if there's a way to populate this on each line received, and not just on complete
[07:58:50] <CRCinAU> so instead of doing: success : function(response) { $target.empty().append(response); }
[07:59:04] <CRCinAU> theres another event I can use to append line by line
[07:59:10] <CRCinAU> or even character by character
[08:05:15] <DarsVaeda> hi, I fadeOut a set of elements and pass a function that to fadeIn one element in the set, but when the elements fadeOut the other one already fades in so there are actually two elements on the page for some time resulting in ugly flickering
[08:05:44] <DarsVaeda> how can I prevent that?
[08:08:21] <DarsVaeda> ah just when asking I find .promise -.-
[08:08:31] <DarsVaeda> nvm that works ^^
[08:14:20] <surianup> I need to hide the ajax request from browser console
[08:14:21] <surianup> is it possible ?

[08:45:17] <sharax> hi friend
[08:47:29] <sharax> hi
[08:47:34] <sharax> please help my friend
[08:47:35] <sharax> http://kopy.io/4q8qN
[08:48:02] <sharax> i need find 'women' from value
[08:48:23] <sharax> and used on "if"
[08:49:31] <sharax> please help :(
[08:54:55] <taplar> sharax: what is 'data'?
[08:58:42] <taplar> _eddy: you would most likely have to do that logic in a custom validator
[08:59:15] <taplar> surianup: if your meaning hide the ajax request from the browser developer tools, then no.
[08:59:57] <surianup> ok taplar
[09:00:00] <surianup> thanks
[09:10:08] <Birliban> Hi, I haven't used jquery since 1.6! Is there now a faster/more efficient way to get to this:  $(this).prevAll("span.testit") (THIS is a <td> and span.testit is in one of the tds before..) Or this: $(this).parent().prev().find("option:selected")
[09:13:00] <taplar> not sure about the first one, but the second one could probably be made better by adding some sort of relational classes
[09:13:47] <sharax> taplar my problem in match function
[09:14:20] <sharax> data not important It should be explained that
[09:14:46] <taplar> it just looks like, from the paste, your using it without it being defined
[09:15:35] <Birliban> taplar: ok, but this was also possible with 1.6 - so nothing magic did happen since then ;-)
[09:16:03] <taplar> Birliban: nah, nothing that would change that drastically afaik
[09:17:00] <taplar> sharax: if you console log the value what do you get?
[09:17:20] <Birliban> taplar: ok. so thank you
[09:17:44] <taplar> Birliban: you might ask again later when more peeps are in here.  they may/probably know more than me, :)
[10:06:20] <decx> get to the closest tr and find from there

[10:43:55] <Caz> Hello
[10:44:28] <taplar> aloha
[10:44:30] <Caz> I'm trying to do a get request and to retrieve only the headers (to check if the file exists or not without having to download it completely)
[10:44:43] <Caz> What's the better way to do it?
[10:45:06] <taplar> isn't there a 'head' type request?
[10:45:34] <shoky_> yea you can use  type: "HEAD"
[10:46:04] <taplar> https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec9.html for more documentation
[10:47:58] <CaptainKleenex> Guys quick question. How does one compare two values to determine which one is closest to a third value. Example: Value 1 is 20, Value 2 is -15. How do I determine which one is the closest to 0 ?
[10:48:49] <taplar> always zero?
[10:49:25] <CaptainKleenex> Well in this case it would be 104 but yea
[10:50:00] <taplar> you can use Math.abs() in your expression to make it positive, then take the smallest difference
[10:54:23] <CaptainKleenex> Thank you, that should resolve most of the puzzle :)
[11:05:56] <Caz> thanks taplar & shoky_
[11:59:16] <kh-dev> hi
[11:59:26] <kh-dev> :)
[11:59:46] <taplar> aloha
[12:00:31] <kh-dev> am sorry to ask here i know it is a jQuery channel, but all i want to know is what channel is the PHP chat room
[12:00:37] <kh-dev> i tried #php
[12:00:42] <kh-dev> but did not work
[12:00:56] <taplar> you can type /list to see/search for channels
[12:01:23] <kh-dev> in here
[12:01:27] <taplar> your probably after ##php
[12:02:22] <kh-dev> i see thanks you so much taplar
[12:20:22] <_TWG_> Can anyone help me with a simple redirect after a user enters a number into a form input field?
[12:20:40] <robertmaxrees> sure.
[12:20:42] <robertmaxrees> what's your question?
[12:21:33] <_TWG_> Okay.  So I have a simple form that has a single input type password.  How can I check that value and redirect my page if the value matches?
[12:21:52] <robertmaxrees> bind to an event and use an if statement.
[12:22:25] <taplar> probably want to verify the password on the backend too
[12:22:39] <robertmaxrees> depending on what the input is for, sure.
[12:22:59] <_TWG_> It's not a super secret thing.  They just want someone to enter a simple year.
[12:23:06] <robertmaxrees> yeah.
[12:23:11] <robertmaxrees> so what are you stuck on?
[12:23:29] <_TWG_> The redirect part after validation
[12:23:36] <robertmaxrees> window.location.href
[12:23:43] <robertmaxrees> set that to whatever url you want.
[12:23:47] <_TWG_> seriously that easy.  GRR
[12:24:08] <_TWG_> would you bind the function to the actual form or the submit button?
[12:24:16] <robertmaxrees> to the form's submit event.
[12:25:27] <_TWG_> so like $('#formName').on('submit')?
[12:25:31] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[12:26:07] <_TWG_> Awesome.  Sorry, I've been trying to learn more javascript/jquery over the last few days.
[12:26:15] <robertmaxrees> Totally fine :)
[12:26:21] <robertmaxrees> this is what we're here for.
[12:28:17] <_TWG_> I might be back in a second with a question or two.  Trying this out now.
[12:32:17] <_TWG_> @robertmaxrees that worked like a charm
[12:32:23] <robertmaxrees> awesome.
[13:03:14] <jackdpeterson> Hello all, I'm looking to reject a promise after 2 seconds if a third party library continues to wait / execute for a time that's longer than acceptable. Any suggestions on how to do this?
[13:03:56] <jackdpeterson> The third party library in this case may call a remote service that may / may not respond (I'm just building for the assumption that at some point in time it'll fail).
[13:10:52] <taplar> i take it the promise is from the third party library?
[13:11:15] <robertmaxrees> jackdpeterson you'd use a setTimeout with https://api.jquery.com/deferred.reject/
[13:13:06] <jackdpeterson> thanks @robertmaxrees
[13:13:41] <robertmaxrees> why would the other lib take that long?
[13:15:19] <jackdpeterson> The possibility I'm thinking of is that their remote server is down / maxed out with requests. I've worked with a number of third-party integrations that have in the past caused sites that rely on their functionality to hang up or otherwise due to third-party servers not responding reasonably fast.
[13:15:40] <robertmaxrees> i'd rely on the timeout at that point.
[13:15:41] <Forbidd3n> I have a custom function $.fn.caseChange = function(options){ return this.each(function(){ console.log( $(this) ); }); } and I call it like this $('h1, h2').caseChange({ toCase: 'titleCase' }); but the each loop in the function isn't triggering. Ideas
[13:15:53] <jackdpeterson> most frequently observed with things that do end-user tracking of behaviour (e.g., log when a user clicks on some KPI kind of functionality on a page).
[13:15:53] <robertmaxrees> Forbidd3n make a fiddle.
[13:15:55] <Forbidd3n> If I console.log( this) outside of each it is an empty object - Object []
[13:16:32] <taplar> so no matched elements
[13:18:04] <Forbidd3n> robertmaxrees: Here you go - jsfiddle.net/7yzbohq5
[13:18:58] <Forbidd3n> jsfiddle.net/7yzbohq5/1 - I forgot to add jquery external file
[13:19:26] <taplar> check your console
[13:19:53] <Forbidd3n> taplar: not sure why it is saying it isn't a function - it doesn't do that when I have it lcoally
[13:19:58] <duch_kazatel> you'
[13:19:59] <gambl0re> hi robert
[13:20:06] <Forbidd3n> oh probably because I have it at the top
[13:20:07] <duch_kazatel> *you aren't initializing the method first.
[13:20:14] <duch_kazatel> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/ypf6kLL1/1/ Forbidd3n
[13:20:40] <robertmaxrees> hey gambl0re.
[13:21:00] <gambl0re> hows things? did you have lunch yet?
[13:21:09] <robertmaxrees> uh
[13:21:12] <Forbidd3n> robertmaxrees: yeah I moved it, but when I run it locally it doesn't run
[13:21:38] <Forbidd3n> I have the $('h1, h2') in a separate file with (function($){ ... })(jQuery) - does that affect it?
[13:21:39] <robertmaxrees> gambl0re i really don't understand why you ask me that question all the time.
[13:21:50] <robertmaxrees> Forbidd3n are you getting console errors?
[13:21:53] <robertmaxrees> ruynning things in a doc ready?
[13:21:54] <robertmaxrees> etc.
[13:22:26] <Forbidd3n> no, in (function($){ .. })(jQuery)
[13:22:32] <Forbidd3n> should I be using doc ready?
[13:22:44] <robertmaxrees> the code selecting the h1 and h2 needs to come after them or be in a doc ready.
[13:22:56] <Forbidd3n> thanks that was it
[13:31:04] <Forbidd3n> robertmaxrees: how would I get the h1 and the h2 item from $.fn.caseChange = function(...){...}
[13:31:13] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[13:31:35] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/ypf6kLL1/1/
[13:31:44] <robertmaxrees> 'this' is the jquery object of the selector.
[13:31:50] <Forbidd3n> nvm I found it
[13:41:25] <plujon> Does jquery have a function for [1, 2].include(2) ?
[13:41:47] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[13:42:35] <Forbidd3n> I have a function $.fn.upperCase = function(text){ ... } - when I try to do $.upperCase('test'); it says $.upperCase is not a function
[13:42:40] <Forbidd3n> any ideas?
[13:42:52] <robertmaxrees> because it's in the wrong namespace.
[13:43:00] <robertmaxrees> $.fn is for methods - you want $.uppercase
[13:43:25] <taplar> and .toUpperCase() already exists...
[13:43:29] <robertmaxrees> ^
[13:43:48] <taplar> unless you actually mean capitalize, which there may be one for that too
[13:43:49] <Forbidd3n> taplar: I know. That was an example
[13:44:08] <Forbidd3n> robertmaxrees: thanks!
[14:21:51] <tocka> Hi guys, could someone help me with TweenMax and TimelineMax? I have this animation, what I want to do is to fade it out after 1 second delay and after the first animation has finished? I cant figure out how :( https://jsfiddle.net/oeyxmgb5/
[14:32:37] <_TWG_> Well I just wasted time on writing JQuery to do a simple function.  Now the user wants and email when people enter the password on a form.
[14:32:49] <robertmaxrees> uh
[14:32:58] <robertmaxrees> _TWG_ what are you building?
[14:33:43] <_TWG_> It's a page that has a field for a password.  They are given the generic password to redirect them to another page.  The end user now wants to receive an email when anyone enters the generic password and is then redirected.
[14:33:54] <robertmaxrees> ... why?
[14:33:58] <momomo> I am making a manual XMLHttpRequest() .. but it doesn't seem to be using a cached version when previous response set expires and cache headers long into the future ... js files and css is hitting the browser cache though ... is there a way to get XMLHttpRequest to use cache also ?
[14:34:30] <robertmaxrees> momomo ajax calls should hit browser cache.  you're not using a cachebust on the url, yeah?
[14:34:55] <momomo> robertmaxrees, i am not using jquery for this as it is before jquery is loaded .. ( in the index.html file )
[14:35:08] <robertmaxrees> momomo that's not what i asked ;)
[14:35:19] <robertmaxrees> it's possible to use your own cachebust
[14:35:21] <momomo> no, i am not using any padding to the url
[14:35:32] <momomo> i want the cache
[14:35:35] <robertmaxrees> okay.  dunno then.  i'd make sure the headers are all correct.
[14:35:56] <robertmaxrees> since XMLHttpRequest should follow the same rules as other assets.
[14:35:57] <momomo> they are the same headers as for js files .. and those are cached
[14:36:05] <robertmaxrees> if you're still having issues, try asking in ##javascript.
[14:36:07] <_TWG_> robertmaxrees why what?
[14:36:16] <momomo> robertmaxrees, mostly noobs there :(
[14:36:20] <momomo> lol
[14:36:24] <robertmaxrees> momomo more on topic there :)
[14:36:32] <robertmaxrees> _TWG_ why do they want an email?
[14:36:34] <stinkyrc> Does anybody know of a good plugin to make images act like checkboxes such that I can long press (desktop or mobile) on an image amongst a group of images and the whole class will go into select mode? Then I can click individual images on and off. Clicking off the last image will take the class out of select mode. I have played with finger a bit and that gives me a ‘press’ event but it doesn’t suppress the clicks and mouseups 
[14:36:50] <momomo> robertmaxrees, are jquery ajax calls normally cached ?
[14:36:59] <_TWG_> I work in higher education.  It's a mystery
[14:37:02] <robertmaxrees> momomo they use XMLHttpRequest under the hood.
[14:37:06] <momomo> if cache is set to false, does jquery pad the url with a random number /
[14:37:10] <momomo> ?
[14:37:30] <robertmaxrees> momomo fwiw a lot of browsers use different rules between assets and XMLHttpRequest w/r/t caching.
[14:37:31] <stinkyrc> @momomo I would assume they are if they should be cached (the server says the response is cacheable)
[14:37:53] <robertmaxrees> so i would verify that your headers are correct no just against assets, but against the actual spec.
[14:38:47] <momomo> http://hastebin.com/garajoloji.mel
[14:39:18] <robertmaxrees> http://blog.httpwatch.com/2009/08/07/ajax-caching-two-important-facts/
[14:41:02] <_TWG_> robertmaxrees I've been asking the same question about why they want it.
[14:41:16] <robertmaxrees> _TWG_ if they want some kind of reporting, that should be built separately.
[14:41:38] <momomo> robertmaxrees, i'll try add some of those headers, thanks
[14:41:53] <_TWG_> Well it's not like they enter any personal information.  They literally send everyone to the same link and they all use the same password.  robertmaxrees
[14:42:13] <robertmaxrees> what would the email contain?
[14:42:18] <robertmaxrees> and that's really bad authentication
[14:43:01] <_TWG_> oh i know.  I don't know why they want authentication on it if they post the password on the page right before it.
[14:44:56] <momomo> you think this is ok: Last-Modified:Thu, 01 Jan 1970 00:00:00 GMT
[14:45:47] <robertmaxrees> https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html
[14:45:53] <robertmaxrees> i'd read the docs.
[15:01:18] <huck5> Hi there. I have an element with `style="visibility: hidden;"`, and when I check this with `$("#mySelector").is(":visible");` i get a returned result of `true`. What's going on?
[15:01:36] <robertmaxrees> are you repeating that ID?
[15:01:47] <huck5> robertmaxrees, I'm quite certain I am not
[15:01:54] <robertmaxrees> i'd triple check.
[15:01:59] <huck5> I'll do that now, thanks
[15:02:25] <huck5> Is it maybe that jQuery is looking for an element-attribute of `hidden="true"` rather tha for a css style?
[15:02:31] <robertmaxrees> nope
[15:02:43] <robertmaxrees> it's checking if the element can be seen by the end user.
[15:02:55] <robertmaxrees> ah
[15:02:55] <robertmaxrees> https://api.jquery.com/visible-selector/
[15:03:04] <robertmaxrees> "Elements are considered visible if they consume space in the document. Visible elements have a width or height that is greater than zero."
[15:03:16] <robertmaxrees> "Elements with visibility: hidden or opacity: 0 are considered visible, since they still consume space in the layout."
[15:03:18] <robertmaxrees> there you go.
[15:03:28] <huck5> Ah! robertmaxrees that is certainly the reason! Thanks very much for finding that :)

[15:58:46] <z1haze> coul that be done in local storage?
[15:59:14] <btothem> Cookie with the date of the last message read and then only show if the date of the message is newer.
[16:00:23] <taplar> you could possibly do it with session storage

[16:12:34] <Penorsaurus> to add icons next to each select option
[16:13:37] <taplar> you'll have to use jquery ui or something of the like to do that
[16:14:03] <Penorsaurus> I can't j ust use an img tag
[16:14:07] <Penorsaurus> next to the "Red"?
[16:14:33] <taplar> nope, raw html select fields don't do images
[16:14:51] <taplar> one of the limitations which led to the plugins that extend them
[16:15:05] <Penorsaurus> fuck
[16:15:43] <taplar> http://jqueryui.com/selectmenu/
[16:16:39] <taplar> specifically http://jqueryui.com/selectmenu/#custom_render , the second option is an example
[16:22:27] <Penorsaurus> taplar, from a .js file
[16:22:31] <Penorsaurus> is there a way to import it?
[16:22:48] <taplar> hmm?
[18:53:36] <zro> i know im not supposed to try and do sync ajax, but i need to pass a callback to another lib that returns tru or false, and the validation criteria is dependent on an external call and i cant get my head around how to do it
[18:54:58] <zro> http://sprunge.us/iWHg?javascript
[18:55:01] <zro> any insight?
[18:55:29] <duch_kazatel> you can't return true or false from ajax.
[18:55:38] <duch_kazatel> still needs to be done via a callback.
[18:56:05] <zro> right right
[18:56:36] <zro> i cant put some kind of while loop in the isValid callback to wait for the ajax?
[18:56:54] <robertmaxrees> that doesn't change your core problem.
[18:57:00] <robertmaxrees> you cannot return out of ajax the way you think you can.
[18:57:19] <robertmaxrees> what library are you using?
[18:57:30] <zro> but i can success: function (){something = true}, no?
[18:57:49] <robertmaxrees> right, you can give ajax a callback.
[18:58:22] <robertmaxrees> you can turn off async, but locking the end user's browser is a bad idea.
[18:59:07] <zro> i couldnt get it to work with asyn:false either. here gimme a sec
[19:03:47] <zro> excuse the sloppiness: http://sprunge.us/jELO?javascript
[19:04:14] <zro> can't i send off the request and just get stuck in a while loop until the success is called?
[19:04:14] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[19:04:18] <zro>  i cant seem to get tit ot work
[19:04:19] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[19:04:23] <robertmaxrees> what library are you using?
[19:04:34] <zro> Thing is Pikaday
[19:04:45] <zro> the disableDayfn
[19:04:56] <robertmaxrees> while is a loop, so it calls load over and over - you'll get dozens of ajax calls.
[19:05:01] <robertmaxrees> which is really bad.
[19:05:37] <zro> no, not calling load() in the loop. calling like while(found ===false) and success: function {found = true}
[19:05:52] <robertmaxrees> err, either way.
[19:05:54] <robertmaxrees> still bad.
[19:06:09] <zro> ya, clearly not working anyway
[19:06:15] <robertmaxrees> i'm not seeing an isValid option.
[19:06:22] <robertmaxrees> on https://github.com/dbushell/Pikaday
[19:06:44] <zro> sorry, that was just POC, the callback is disableDayFn
[19:07:24] <robertmaxrees> okay.  so the right way to do this is to initialize pikaday in an ajax callback.
[19:07:33] <zro> ah
[19:07:38] <zro> ok...
[19:07:41] <robertmaxrees> so invert the logic.
[19:07:56] <zro> ya i figure thats the right answer but im troubling getting me head around it
[19:09:16] <robertmaxrees> https://bpaste.net/show/88a414d23eeb
[19:09:19] <robertmaxrees> this won't work out of the box.
[19:09:22] <robertmaxrees> but that's the idea.
[19:09:58] <zro> ok, hmmm
[19:10:23] <zro> but i dont knwo the dates to make the ajax call query until pikaday passes the date
[19:10:25] <zro> here sec
[19:11:45] <robertmaxrees> then run the ajax call, store the dates, and go from there.
[19:16:51] <zro> ok ya. I gotta write another thing to just return all the dates or soemthing. cuz they way i have it now, I'm using the dated passed by pikaday to make the call
[19:17:04] <robertmaxrees> right, you can't do that.
[19:17:17] <robertmaxrees> in fact, you should grey those days out ahead of time and make the unselectable.
[19:18:29] <zro> thats what the callback does. it calls the fn onDisplay, not select
[19:18:59] <robertmaxrees> is onDisplay the same as when it is initialized?
[19:19:18] <zro> no like when u display a month, it passes each day to the fn
[19:19:46] <zro> so like as you click thru the months, it passes ~30 dates, if it returns true, its greys it out
[19:19:52] <robertmaxrees> then yeah, you'd need to fetch all that data ahead of time, init the picker, then check that data in a callback.
[19:20:26] <zro> so my first call has to get ALL the valid dates. that seems kinnda crappy
[19:20:40] <zro> but i cant think of a way otherwise i guess
[19:20:53] <robertmaxrees> it's either that or you freeze the user's browser.
[19:21:01] <robertmaxrees> and youy could get just invalid dates.
[19:22:00] <zro> ya ok, ima rewrite this crap
[19:22:10] <robertmaxrees> it's not crap.
[19:22:10] <zro> thnx for stopping me in my futile efforts
[19:22:13] <robertmaxrees> just need to learn :)
[19:22:15] <zro> :)
[20:29:09] <zro> months are zero indexed?! i just wasted hours learning this...

[23:39:48] <stevesmename_> hello - need some assistance with doing replaceWith() craziness. Using slick carousel (https://github.com/kenwheeler/slick/) and Drupal. I want to take the caption from a sliding <div> element and insert/fade the .html() into another $(selector). I have had no luck, any helpful volunteers to review code?
