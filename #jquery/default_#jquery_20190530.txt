[10:54:36] * taplar whistles
[15:49:06] <Inazad> hi there, I have a form that I validate with required attribute. I want to post the data in AJAX on submit. I try to bind a function on the onSubmit event of the form but the form is posted anyway
[15:49:11] <Inazad> how I can manage this ?
[15:49:32] <taplar> you have to make sure to cancel the submit event
[15:49:43] <Inazad> how to
[15:50:02] <taplar> are you accepting the event in on the event listener?
[15:51:24] <taplar> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event/preventDefault
[15:53:59] <Inazad> no
[15:54:25] <taplar> Then you will need to change your listener to accept it, so you can call preventDefault() on it
[15:55:04] <Inazad> how I set the listener for a form ?
[15:55:14] <Inazad> do you have a basic example of this ?
[15:55:42] <taplar> can you show me the logic that you currently have in a fiddle or codepen?
[15:56:40] <Inazad> I have no logic
[15:56:47] <Inazad> just set the required attribute on the field
[15:57:01] <Inazad> and when I click on submit button, there is a validate happens
[15:57:04] <taplar> you said earlier that you were trying to bind to the on submit of the form
[15:57:27] <Inazad> I'm trying like <form onsubmit="foo()">   but didnt work
[15:57:39] <taplar> ok, so yeah, avoid inline bindings
[15:57:40] <Inazad> foo()   {  e.preventDefault();  }
[15:57:52] <taplar> and secondly, let me get you a reference.
[15:58:08] <taplar> http://learn.jquery.com/events/event-basics/
[15:58:27] <taplar> You want to target your form, and create an event binding for the "submit" event.
[15:58:43] <Inazad> it works with the form ID ?
[15:58:53] <taplar> any valid selector will work, yes
[15:59:07] <taplar> are you familiar with CSS?
[15:59:12] <Inazad> a little bit yes
[15:59:26] <taplar> so a selector is exactly the same as how you define a css rule
[15:59:48] <taplar> #mything, .myOtherThing, ...whatever... {}
[15:59:56] <taplar> that part before the {} is examples of selectors
[16:00:54] <Inazad> I want to bind it only in the specific form
[16:01:06] <Inazad> do I need to place the code in the jquery ready function ?
[16:01:17] <taplar> You can to be safe.
[16:02:06] <Inazad> do you have a kind of example
[16:02:22] <taplar> that link i gave you has examples
[16:02:30] <taplar> and much more detailed information
[16:04:45] <Inazad> if my form ID is "patientFrm"
[16:05:22] <taplar> yeah?
[16:05:26] <Inazad> I dont see it for the forms
[16:05:34] <taplar> what do you mean?
[16:05:56] <Inazad> in the events page documentation
[16:05:58] <robertmaxrees> all event handlers work the same - $('theElementYouWantToTarget').on('theEvent', function() {});
[16:06:09] <taplar> how would you define a CSS rule for that form id?
[16:08:04] <Inazad> robertmaxrees, I put the ID in replace of "theElementYouWantToTarget"
[16:08:08] <taplar> <how do i target the form> { color: red; }
[16:08:59] <taplar> ?
[16:11:41] <taplar> http://learn.jquery.com/using-jquery-core/selecting-elements/
[16:12:03] <taplar> # signifies an id
[16:12:28] <taplar> so #patientFrm, for example
[16:13:22] <Inazad> doesn't work
[16:13:27] <taplar> show me
[16:13:48] <Inazad> $('#patientFrm').on('onSubmit', function() {
[16:13:48] <Inazad>         e.preventDefault();
[16:13:48] <Inazad>         console.log('Test');
[16:13:48] <Inazad>     });
[16:13:56] <taplar> in a fiddle or codepen please
[16:14:08] <Inazad> the form is submitting
[16:14:08] <taplar> and you are not accepting in the event on the listenr
[16:14:15] <Inazad> I don't undestand
[16:14:37] <taplar> $(elementSelector).on(event, function(e){ ... });
[16:14:55] <taplar> You have to accept the event in on the event listener
[16:15:12] <taplar> also 'onSubmit' is not an event.  'submit' is
[16:15:32] <Inazad> I typed submit
[16:15:34] <Inazad> didn't work
[16:15:40] <taplar> show me
[16:15:40] <Inazad> the form is submiting.
[16:15:49] <Inazad> how to ? I have a lot of code
[16:15:57] <taplar> jsfiddle.net  codepen.io
[16:15:58] <taplar> one of those
[16:16:34] <Inazad> damn I have to type it everything
[16:16:51] <taplar> copy paste?
[16:17:11] <taplar> all i need, right now, really is just your attempt at the binding
[16:17:28] <taplar> but we don't want multiline code pasted to the channel
[16:17:51] <Inazad> the event is not binding
[16:18:11] <Inazad> do I have to put it into the document.ready Function ?
[16:18:21] <taplar> as i said, you can.
[16:18:34] <taplar> depending on the structure of your page, it may not be necessary, but it never hurts
[16:19:42] <Inazad> it doesn't work
[16:19:46] <taplar> show me dude
[16:20:08] <Inazad> https://codepen.io/anon/pen/LoXNxX
[16:20:40] <robertmaxrees> gotta pass the event param to the callback - should be function(e) {
[16:20:42] <taplar> so you're still not including the event on the event handler
[16:21:14] <Inazad> I dont understand
[16:21:32] <robertmaxrees> Inazad right now you're doing function() { - you want function(e) {
[16:21:32] <taplar> robert just gave the change to you in his statement, as did i a few comments back
[16:21:35] <robertmaxrees> ^
[16:22:00] <taplar> you cannot just call a method on a variable.  the variable has to exist
[16:22:04] <robertmaxrees> need to define the event arg in the callback.  just slap e between the open and close parens after function
[16:25:44] * robertmaxrees puts on the jeopardy think mu-
[16:25:46] <robertmaxrees> awwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww
[16:25:53] <taplar> XD  hmm?
[16:26:01] <robertmaxrees> they just left
[16:26:17] <taplar> ah.  *shrug*
[16:28:58] <taplar> lmao, oh fk, i just thought about making that my ringtone
[16:29:09] <taplar> then i could just stand there confused for a bit every time
[16:29:59] <taplar> wonder if anyone has remixed that
[16:32:01] <taplar> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RNkdJ-OAtE awww yeah
