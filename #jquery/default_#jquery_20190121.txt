[08:53:22] <yakiza> Hello guys i am trying to adopt this clock https://weareoutman.github.io/clockpicker/jquery.html  i have copied the html code from that page and i have referenced jquery  but it doesnt seem to work am i missign something
[09:09:10] <Cork> yakiza: provide the code you're trying with
[09:09:22] <Cork> else it isn't easy to say what you're doing wrong
[09:09:34] <Cork> (preferably make a jsfiddle)
[09:09:48] <yakiza> http://jsfiddle.net/7wjgmLyc/
[09:09:58] <yakiza> this is an exact copy of their jsfiddle
[09:15:27] <Cork> ah, heh that took WAY more time then it should to spot...
[09:15:40] <Cork> yakiza: you aren't including the clockpicker plugin
[09:15:58] <yakiza> How do i do that?
[09:16:10] <Cork> you add a script tag pointing to the plugins .js file
[09:16:20] <Cork> (a resource in jsfiddle)
[09:16:31] <Cork> (left side under fiddle meta)
[09:16:43] <yakiza> where do i find this file though>?
[09:16:58] <Cork> you would have to look at the plugin authors website
[09:17:15] <yakiza> http://weareoutman.github.io/clockpicker/dist/jquery-clockpicker.min.css is this it?
[09:17:21] <Cork> check the ending
[09:17:22] <yakiza> http://weareoutman.github.io/clockpicker/dist/jquery-clockpicker.min.js
[09:17:29] <Cork> you need both
[09:19:23] <yakiza> I just did it, it works on fiddle but not on my computer...
[09:19:26] <yakiza> this is weird
[09:19:36] <undefined_bob> ya, I was just about to type the you didnt include the .js and .css files :)
[09:19:48] <Cork> yakiza: jsfiddle wrapps it in an onload by default
[09:19:52] <Cork> you need .ready localt
[09:20:14] <yakiza> what is that?
[09:21:42] <Cork> yakiza: http://learn.jquery.com/using-jquery-core/document-ready/
[09:21:50] <Cork> i recommend reading through that site completely
[09:21:53] <undefined_bob> I only included the links to your fiddle and it seems to work: http://jsfiddle.net/9ozt2xra/2/
[09:22:40] <Cork> undefined_bob: the problem is when he rewrites it, not when he uses jsfiddle
[09:23:35] <undefined_bob> oh, I read it like he was talking about the fiddle
[09:24:59] <yakiza> Cork:  So i add those lines on top of my page??
[09:25:16] <Cork> yakiza: you wrap the code you had in jsfiddle
[09:25:31] <Cork> $(function() { /* jsfiddle code goes here */ });
[09:26:06] <yakiza> oohhhh
[09:27:03] <Cork> yakiza: the ready function delays the execution until the document actually exists
[09:27:27] <Cork> it is a very common mistake ppl make when copying from jsfiddle
[09:28:54] <yakiza> Cork: like this? http://jsfiddle.net/7wjgmLyc/1/
[09:29:05] <yakiza> i am exteremly new to javascript
[09:29:19] <Cork> line 1 shouldn't be in jsfiddle
[09:29:26] <Cork> same with line 23
[09:29:39] <yakiza> yeah i am just asking is that how i  am supposed to have it in my local html file
[09:29:40] <Cork> but ya, that is how you should add it to yourown webpage
[09:29:47] <yakiza> still doesnt work
[09:29:57] <Cork> what error do you get in the console?
[09:30:52] <yakiza> https://prnt.sc/ma3tol
[09:30:54] <yakiza> Cork:
[09:31:13] <Cork> just give me the error text if you got any
[09:31:41] <yakiza> click the link on toop
[09:39:03] <chawixxx> hi! I'm trying to uncheck a checkbox by default but no success... any clue?
[09:39:04] <yakiza> Cork:  thank you anyway :)
[09:39:10] <chawixxx> https://thepasteb.in/p/qjhLB41DLX3TB
[09:39:37] <chawixxx> I mean, the property is correct, but not the visual mark
[09:39:55] <Cork> chawixxx: make sure the selector matches any element $().length > 0 (run it before the line you have)
[09:43:37] <chawixxx> I already tried it, but I'm getting the same
[09:44:58] <Cork> console.log('matches:', $('#component_key_val').length) gives you "matches: 1" in the console?
[09:45:12] <Cork> (note add it before the line, don't run it in the console)
[09:47:44] <chawixxx> done! thank you
[09:48:09] <chawixxx> the problem was that $(document) doesn't have a load event, I forgot that
[09:48:39] <Cork> recommended is to use $(function() {});
[09:48:40] <chawixxx> but using $(window) solves the issue
[09:49:01] <chawixxx> ok I will try your recommendation anyway
[10:13:55] <hollusion> im somehow confused about $.ajax() sending an object via the data option via POST
[10:14:05] <hollusion> is there a limit of depth/nestedness?
[10:17:48] <hollusion> ah nvm it was a syntax mistake
[15:10:34] <robertmaxrees> weeeee

[17:32:15] <c_bluntish> hey anyone about
[17:32:19] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[17:32:24] <c_bluntish> yay!!!! :)
[17:32:51] <c_bluntish> how have you been sir?
[17:32:56] <robertmaxrees> i've been
[17:33:14] <robertmaxrees> what's up?
[17:33:40] <c_bluntish> just been?
[17:34:01] <robertmaxrees> lots of stuff going on heh.  don't really wanna spill deets about my personal life.
[17:34:11] <c_bluntish> fair enough
[17:34:43] <c_bluntish> sorry if I was pushy :) .... well I have an issue, I think u have helped me just by me trying formulating my question
[17:34:44] <c_bluntish> brb
[17:38:05] <robertmaxrees> good ol' rubber duck debugging
[17:49:33] <c_bluntish> hehehe
[17:51:35] <c_bluntish> worked, I was trying to get the value of a checkbox using .val() on a .each ... but I found it I just used my selectors right, so using for each on  ('.smscandidate:checked') rather than on ('.smscandidate') and then checking if checked later fixed my problem :)
[17:51:57] <robertmaxrees> "using for each"???
[17:53:01] <c_bluntish> .each(function(){})
[17:53:06] <robertmaxrees> ah.
[17:53:08] <robertmaxrees> hrm.
[17:53:13] <robertmaxrees> just trying to get values or something?
[17:53:25] <c_bluntish> yeah was anoying, but fixed :)
[17:53:32] <robertmaxrees> heh
[17:53:37] <robertmaxrees> there are other ways to do that.
[17:53:47] <c_bluntish> thanks to having to forumlate my question seaking with you i fixed it
[17:53:52] <c_bluntish> oh do tell, b rb in 2 mins
[17:56:08] <robertmaxrees> totally depends on what exactly you're trying to do.
[18:02:43] <c_bluntish> indeed, It worked great!
[18:02:54] <robertmaxrees> heh
[18:03:06] <robertmaxrees> are you trying to get a list of checked boxes or...?
[18:04:16] <c_bluntish> thanks for all the previous help ... it was for a list of staff that need a sms reminder
[18:04:29] <robertmaxrees> yeah, there are better ways to do that instead of using each
[18:05:16] <c_bluntish> I am sure their are, but this worked great
[18:05:26] <robertmaxrees> lol
[18:05:29] <c_bluntish> I am way crapper a coder than you hehe
[18:05:58] <robertmaxrees> not making any judgements - but also, "it works" isn't really a good concession imo.
[18:06:35] <robertmaxrees> since there are tools to do exactly what you want.
[18:06:36] <robertmaxrees> but meh.
[22:20:22] <devi8> can someone explain why this header tends to flicker on scroll. I haven't been able to figure out when it happens exactly: https://jsfiddle.net/neverDevi8/hmpcz213/63/
[23:56:18] <quesker> cheerio is kind of jquery for node.js right?  I want to delete rows (in multiple tables) where the first column text is "Text:".  like $('something').remove()
