[03:11:57] <oojacoboo> why would $("input").val() give me the value of the placeholder attr when `value` isn't set?
[03:16:14] <xec> oojacoboo: it shouldnt, unless the value is set to the same as the placeholder somehow?
[03:16:27] <oojacoboo> it's not
[03:16:35] <oojacoboo> I'm very confused
[03:17:01] <oojacoboo> I searched the entire codebase to ensure it's not getting set as well, and it's not, the only instance of the string is the placeholder attr
[03:17:26] <xec> maybe you have a hidden input
[03:17:41] <oojacoboo> xec I apologize ><
[03:17:44] <xec> $("input") would just select all inputs
[03:17:55] <oojacoboo> actually
[03:18:35] <oojacoboo> yea... this.value = search.attr("placeholder")
[03:18:38] <oojacoboo> *sigh*
[03:18:50] <xec> that would explain it xD
[03:18:53] <oojacoboo> I love how this sits in the shadowdom, makes inspection so easy!
[03:44:28] <Uhkis> is there really no jquery function to return outerHTML
[03:45:18] <Cork> .prop('outerHTML')?
[03:45:35] <Cork> and no, no direct function
[03:46:27] <Uhkis> [0].outerHTML is less typing! :D
[03:46:46] <Cork> except it crashes if it didn't result in anything
[03:46:56] <Cork> $('').prop('outerHTML') shouldn't crash
[03:47:08] * Cork tries to make sure :P
[03:47:49] <Cork> Uhkis: https://jsfiddle.net/u1n4w054/
[03:47:56] <Uhkis> in this case there's a lot more problems if that's not found
[03:48:42] <Cork> ya, but if there was a function directly on jquery for outerHTML it would do exactly what .prop('outerHTML') does
[04:17:50] <Neo1> Cork: hi
[04:18:14] <Neo1> Cork: I passed tests on upwork, see my result, What should I learn https://prnt.sc/gr2vq1
[04:18:28] <Neo1> Cork: css and html are main for web?
[04:18:45] <Neo1> Cork: Give advise
[04:18:57] <Neo1> jQuery I know good )))
[04:19:53] <Cork> well "html5" is not the same as html
[04:20:17] <Cork> but ya html and css is things you need to know to create pages
[04:20:18] <Neo1> Cork: and css too?
[04:20:34] <Neo1> Cork: I couldn't pass test :(
[04:20:49] <Neo1> Cork: second time tried and can't, it's difficult things
[04:20:53] <Cork> the comment about "html5" is that i can't say what that test will be about
[04:21:12] <Neo1> Cork: css test it's about selectors
[04:21:20] <Cork> html5 is marketing speech for "cool stuff you couldn't do before 2010"
[04:21:46] <Cork> so it includes network, javascript, css and html form
[04:22:06] <Cork> so again can't say what that test is testing so donno about that one
[04:22:15] <Cork> but i would say all of them are quite important
[04:22:23] <Neo1> Cork:  tests on upwork.com
[04:22:23] <Cork> (html, css and js i mean)
[04:23:01] <Cork> doesn't really answer the question though
[04:23:10] <Neo1> js is diffiucult, there examples of code and you need choose correct answer what will output console.log
[04:23:30] <Neo1> or what will have some variable after execute code
[04:23:40] <Cork> i get kinda suspicious when ppl that claim they know what they're talking about uses the term "html5" for a standard
[04:23:53] <Neo1> II got 1.15, there was 42 questions
[04:24:54] <Neo1> Cork: HTML5 I was passing a few months back, there questions about video, how insert video. I forgot
[04:25:00] <Neo1> difficult questions
[04:25:00] <Cork> Neo1: my advice would be make sure you learn the basics of css and html (mdn has some good tutorials)
[04:25:28] <Cork> after that decide something you want to create, and look up things you need to make it work
[04:25:46] <Neo1> test is saying I know nothing in this
[04:25:52] <Cork> i'm not convinced the site you use is worth that much
[04:26:26] <Cork> Neo1: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web
[04:26:47] <Neo1> Cork: I know basics, selectors and know some styles, but there was questions about flex
[04:27:07] <Cork> you won't find answers to that in tests sites
[04:27:21] <Neo1> Cork: no I passed all honestly
[04:27:25] <Cork> flex is also quite new so there isn't THAT much about it on the net yet
[04:27:38] <Cork> Neo1: ya, but my point is that doesn't mean much
[04:27:45] <Neo1> Cork: yes there was 3 question abut flex
[04:28:12] <Cork> stop caring about scores and look at getting to the knowledge instead
[04:28:12] <Neo1> Cork: you think css is mean nothing for web?
[04:28:26] <Cork> no, i didn't say that
[04:28:37] <Cork> i said running tests "for what you know" is pointless
[04:29:21] <Neo1> if I have low score it means I have low knowledge, It's interdependent
[04:29:27] <Cork> just get started and be hungry, look around for solutions to the problem and be honest to your self when you feel unsure about something
[04:29:32] <Cork> then read up on that topic
[04:29:40] <Neo1> Cork: why? It show weak places
[04:29:41] <Cork> if you feel you can do the job you need, scores doesn't matter
[04:29:51] <Cork> that's the problem, it doesn't
[04:30:11] <Cork> it shows that you don't know something specific they thing you must know
[04:30:18] <Neo1> Cork: I feel I don't know css and html and always feel hard when encounter with it
[04:30:42] <Cork> but it is 1. a point in time, 2. not sure you need it for what you want to do 3. will be wrong depending on what case you are trying to apply it
[04:30:53] <Cork> Neo1: then start reading into it
[04:30:59] <Cork> don't run tests
[04:31:09] <Neo1> I can't do html markup (psd to html)
[04:31:19] <Cork> (see above answer)
[04:31:30] <Neo1> Cork: books?
[04:31:47] <Neo1> Cork: you mean take books about css html and read?
[04:31:48] <Cork> books online tutorials, blogposts on the subject mdn your choice
[04:32:04] <Cork> i've read 1 javascript book and none for css or html my entire life :)
[04:32:24] <Cork> (and the book was back in 1996)
[04:32:38] <Neo1> Cork: I did not read about javascript and jQuery and a few books about html css and know nothing abut it
[04:33:15] <Cork> so ya, again pick your poison and jump in
[04:33:16] <Neo1> read a few*
[04:33:44] <Neo1> Cork: maybe you use video lessons?
[04:33:52] <Cork> sigh
[04:34:08] <Neo1> Cork: I watched video lessons about jQuery, this helped me
[04:34:08] <Cork> i'm starting to feel like a broken record
[04:34:41] <Neo1> ok
[04:34:50] <Neo1> passed this
[04:35:00] <Neo1> will take book and read about this :(
[04:35:24] <Neo1> I want passed test on 2 - 3 balls from 5
[04:35:27] <Cork> just make sure it isn't too old
[04:35:50] <Neo1> you think should choose up to date book?
[04:35:51] <Cork> the web is moving quite fast so books becomes old quickly
[04:36:00] <Neo1> oh ok
[04:36:24] <Cork> but honestly just pick one and get started
[04:36:38] <Cork> you can update to what is current when you've gotten through the basics
[04:36:51] <Neo1> Cork: what do you think about this site? https://www.w3schools.com/
[04:37:01] <Cork> absolutely not
[04:37:02] <Neo1> Maybe this need to use
[04:37:07] <Neo1> why not?
[04:37:12] <Cork> avoid that site for all you can
[04:37:23] <Neo1> ok
[04:37:28] <Cork> cause it has given out bad advice for the last 20 so years
[04:37:45] <Neo1> but maybe people advise use it
[04:37:52] <Neo1> I wanted too
[04:37:52] <Cork> http://www.w3fools.com/
[04:38:52] <Cork> Neo1: ppl learning web standards on w3schools show later, cause they come confused and asks messed up questions
[04:41:03] <Neo1> ok, I will seek book on modern book on amazon and then download it
[04:41:13] <Neo1> book which has many review
[04:41:16] <Neo1> positive
[04:42:05] <Neo1> html5 and ccs3
[04:42:14] <Neo1> jQuery I know
[06:30:46] <W0LF> i'm trying to implement the code here - https://www.drupal.org/node/990080 - in order to have the taxonomy menu in my views BEF filter be collapsible, but i'm getting an error "The jQuery Once id parameter must be a string"
[07:29:07] <Cork> W0LF: do you have a ref to the code executing?
[07:30:00] <Cork> W0LF: i would recommend searching through the drupal code tree for what does that validation, cause jquery doesn't have it by default
[07:30:45] <Cork> W0LF: so it might be better to ask that question in a drupal channel
[09:36:47] <tinyhippo> I want to put an object into the value of a hidden field of a form, but when I do, I get [Object object] as the value - how else can I do it?
[09:37:14] <Cork> tinyhippo: you can only put strings into dom elements
[09:37:36] <tinyhippo> Cork: so JSON.stringify?
[09:37:39] <Cork> if it only contains simple constructs you can serialize it to json and put that in there
[09:37:43] <Cork> ya :)
[09:39:03] <tinyhippo> Cork: does that mean I'll have to use 's for my dom element attributes rather than "s
[09:39:14] <Cork> tinyhippo: no
[09:40:00] <Cork> you should use .value = json or .val(json) anyway
[09:40:06] <Cork> and it will escape things as needed
[09:40:14] <tinyhippo> ok
[09:40:15] <tinyhippo> thakns
[09:40:32] <Cork> basically attribute values should use entity encoding
[09:41:17] <Cork> so it would be {&#x22;key&#x22;&#x22;value&#x22;}
[09:41:23] <tinyhippo> I see
[09:42:17] <Cork> but don't generate html and parse that for when you modify the dom
[09:42:25] <Cork> it exposes you to xss
[09:50:10] <Dro> Hello, anyone have an idea why this don't works ==> http://jsfiddle.net/lesson8/h4JXs/1/ ?
[09:50:18] <Dro> (click Add, then try Remove)
[09:51:11] <Cork> Dro: you've prob forgotten to save
[09:51:16] <Cork> there is only a save click button there
[09:52:12] <Dro> Cork: sorry, try this http://jsfiddle.net/h4JXs/6231/
[09:53:11] <Cork> Dro: don't use event attributes
[09:53:31] <fn> mixing vanilla and jquery
[09:55:20] <Cork> Dro: http://jsfiddle.net/h4JXs/6233/
[09:56:12] <Cork> (nice jump from 1 to 6231...)
[09:57:52] <Uhkis> Cork: "lesson8" might explain it :p
[09:58:02] <Cork> heh true
[09:58:27] <Cork> i don't tend to read jsfiddle links past .net ^^'
[09:58:56] <Uhkis> i do, because sometimes people paste those silly collaboration links
[10:01:01] <Dro> Cork: thanks, but why it does not work with onclick=remove() ?
[10:02:41] <Cork> Dro: when you call functions from event attributes you won't have "this"
[10:03:03] <Cork> so $(this).remove() will be $(window).remove(), and that is a noop
[10:03:23] <Dro> aaah ok thanks Cork :)
[10:04:16] <Uhkis> Dro: just never use those inline on* attributes and you're golden
[10:04:38] <Cork> well possibly not golden, but you avoid a big batch of problems
[10:04:57] <Dro> Cork: but in this case, that function run when I click any button in the table (#edit-list)
[10:05:17] <Cork> Dro: sure, but like i said "this" won't be the button
[10:05:28] <Cork> it will be the page window object
[10:05:35] <Cork> and you can't run remove() on that
[10:06:14] <Dro> Cork: I mean in your solution :p
[10:06:18] <Cork> there are convoluted ways around it, but just use event listeners :)
[10:06:36] <Cork> Dro: any button as long as they have the .remove class ya
[10:06:49] <Cork> i suspected that was what you where about to do
[10:07:19] <Uhkis> Cork: why did you use button there? as in button.remove, not just .remove
[10:07:19] <Dro> Cork: I tried to put the button class instead of #edit-list but it dont work => http://jsfiddle.net/h4JXs/6234/
[10:07:56] <Cork> Uhkis: didn't trust there wouldn't be a <span class="remove"> or something like that
[10:08:15] <Cork> Dro: ya, cause then you bind to existing buttons
[10:08:24] <Uhkis> Dro: that's because .remove doesn't exist on the page at that point of code execution
[10:08:26] <Cork> and there are none when the event binder runs
[10:08:41] <Cork> Dro: so instead delegate the event handling to a static parent
[10:08:54] <Dro> hmmmm
[10:09:05] <Dro> so how can I make it run only when that button is clicked
[10:09:06] <Cork> check the second argument to .on
[10:09:13] <Cork> it is already done
[10:09:15] <Dro> (prevent that other button in table be affected too)
[10:09:37] <Cork> $('#edit-list').on('click', 'button.remove', function() { runs when you click a <button class="remove"> button
[10:09:47] <Cork> any button that doesn't have that class won't run
[10:11:52] <Cork> Dro: http://jsfiddle.net/h4JXs/6235/
[10:12:26] <Cork> (fix typo) http://jsfiddle.net/h4JXs/6236/
[10:13:28] <Dro> Cork: nice trick, thx
[10:13:38] <Cork> not really a trick
[10:15:48] <Dro> Cork: well for a beginner its surely a trick :p
[10:16:15] <Uhkis> coding isn't tricks, it's magic! :D
[10:16:26] <Cork> heh
[10:36:56] <Dro> Cork: in the same example, how can I get the value of first TD in the same TR with button ?
[10:37:18] <Cork> Dro: the value or the content?
[10:37:54] <Cork> the content would be $(this).closest('tr').find('td').first().text()
[13:34:08] <randymarsh9> hey guys
[13:34:22] <robertmaxrees> morning
[13:34:24] <randymarsh9> what happens if i do a .fadeIn() on an already visible element?
[13:34:44] <randymarsh9> does the DOM just ignore?
[13:35:29] <robertmaxrees> not the DOM
[13:35:32] <robertmaxrees> jquery checks first.
[13:35:51] <randymarsh9> so if it sees it's already visible it just skips the call?
[13:35:56] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/y6n5tw27/
[13:36:00] <robertmaxrees> ^
[13:36:05] <robertmaxrees> a simple test case/.
[13:36:45] <randymarsh9> robertmaxrees: i'm wondering more from a performance standpoint
[13:36:57] <randymarsh9> any issue calling fadeIn over and over on something that's already displayed?
[13:37:02] <robertmaxrees> well.
[13:37:52] <randymarsh9> sounds like a yes lol
[13:37:56] <robertmaxrees> actually.
[13:38:10] <robertmaxrees> 2 things to consider for that.  1) in an ideal world, you wouldn't call fadeIn on something that doesn't need it since your state management shouldn't do that in the first place.
[13:38:15] <robertmaxrees> however
[13:38:20] <robertmaxrees> 2) don't prematurely optimize.
[13:38:31] <randymarsh9> i like #2
[13:38:36] <randymarsh9> :)
[13:38:46] <robertmaxrees> write clean code to handle the former, and keep the latter in mind.
[13:38:51] <robertmaxrees> work on clean code first.
[13:39:08] <randymarsh9> yea there's nothing that can be solved with structuring these statements properly
[13:39:11] <randymarsh9> thanks robert
[13:39:17] <randymarsh9> can't be*
[13:39:20] <randymarsh9> lol
[13:39:22] <robertmaxrees> i was about to say heh.
[13:41:28] <randymarsh9> random question: is there a method to check if an element is visible? or should i be keeping track of whether or not it's visible in a variable?
[13:42:43] <robertmaxrees> i'd flip that question a bit.
[13:42:44] <randymarsh9> if there's a simple way to query the DOM, i would do a simple if statement before calling the .fadeIn(), otherwise the only other way i know is to keep track of whether it has been printed inside a variable
[13:42:50] <robertmaxrees> how are you hiding/showing things?
[13:43:25] <randymarsh9> hiding with .toggle(), showing with .fadeIn()
[13:43:32] <robertmaxrees> yeah so first off.
[13:43:38] <robertmaxrees> don't use .toggle() :)
[13:43:41] <robertmaxrees> basically ever.
[13:43:41] <randymarsh9> lol
[13:43:44] <randymarsh9> why not
[13:43:59] <robertmaxrees> notice how you're having issues now knowing when to hide/show things?
[13:44:06] <randymarsh9> yes
[13:44:13] <robertmaxrees> that's why.
[13:44:22] <randymarsh9> oh
[13:44:24] <robertmaxrees> hjeh
[13:44:39] <robertmaxrees> i'd make a general purpose .hide class in your css and .addClass()/.removeClass()
[13:44:46] <randymarsh9> ah
[13:45:01] <robertmaxrees> the nice benefit of that is you can then do $('someElement').hasClass('hide') or w/e
[13:45:10] <robertmaxrees> and then...
[13:45:25] <robertmaxrees> instead of using .fadeIn() you use CSS aniamtions to fade the element in and out.
[13:45:49] <randymarsh9> so fade opacity using css on the class?
[13:46:03] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[13:46:34] <randymarsh9> and have a display:none on the class i want to hide?
[13:47:01] <robertmaxrees> a-hyup
[13:47:06] <randymarsh9> lol
[13:47:11] <randymarsh9> ok let me try it this way
[13:47:13] <randymarsh9> thank you!!
[13:47:26] <robertmaxrees> def.
[14:02:58] <Al_nz1> how do you loop over all the select pickers that are on a visible tab? :visible only seems to pick whats on the current tab https://jsfiddle.net/bigalnz/DTcHh/37766/
[14:05:26] <robertmaxrees> i don't see any visible tabs on that fiddle.
[14:08:23] <Al_nz1> robertmaxrees: what about https://jsfiddle.net/bigalnz/DTcHh/37771/
[14:08:33] <robertmaxrees> still no dice.
[14:09:50] <robertmaxrees> try clicking on a tab - I'm not seeing anything show up.
[14:13:15] <robertmaxrees> Al_nz1 are those tabs working for you on that fiddle?
[14:13:36] <Uhkis> 37771 damn
[14:13:39] <robertmaxrees> heh
[14:13:54] <robertmaxrees> that's a continuation of a bootstrap template fiddle.
[14:14:02] <Uhkis> oh
[14:14:04] <Al_nz1> try this  https://jsfiddle.net/bigalnz/DTcHh/37775/
[14:14:16] <robertmaxrees> Al_nz1 rad.
[14:14:20] <Al_nz1> my bad
[14:14:29] <robertmaxrees> were you even checking before?
[14:14:42] <robertmaxrees> and you want all selectPickers on the current visible tab?
[14:15:06] <Al_nz1> not quite, all select pickers on any visible tab
[14:16:46] <robertmaxrees> easy.
[14:17:01] <robertmaxrees> flip the question a bit.
[14:17:15] <robertmaxrees> "how do I get the active tab froma  bootstrap nav?"
[14:17:58] <Al_nz1> im not following just yet, I need the select pickers on tab 2 & 3?
[14:18:14] <robertmaxrees> ignore the select pickers for a second.
[14:18:17] <robertmaxrees> trust me on this one.
[14:18:19] <Al_nz1> ok
[14:18:26] <robertmaxrees> start by getting the current active tab pane.
[14:18:29] <Al_nz1> ok
[14:19:06] <robertmaxrees> soooo how do you think you'd do that?
[14:20:31] <Al_nz1> $("ul.tabs li a").find(".active"); ?
[14:20:50] <Al_nz1> $("ul.nav-tabs li a").find(".active");
[14:20:51] <robertmaxrees> the tab pane?
[14:21:02] <robertmaxrees> that gets the active tab - you want the active tab pane
[14:21:42] <Al_nz1> oh ok
[14:21:51] <robertmaxrees> if the class for all the tab panes is .tab-pane and you want the .active ones, what's your selector?
[14:21:52] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[14:22:46] <Al_nz1> so yes it adds active to the class
[14:23:00] <robertmaxrees> okay.  so what's your selector?
[14:23:01] <Al_nz1> .tab-pane.active
[14:23:05] <robertmaxrees> boom
[14:23:19] <robertmaxrees> so now that you have that, how would you get all select pickers under that element?
[14:23:57] <Al_nz1> $('.tab-pane.active').each('.selectpicker.edu')
[14:24:02] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[14:24:06] <robertmaxrees> .each()?
[14:24:25] <robertmaxrees> .each() would just enumerate over all elements in $('.tab-pane.active')
[14:24:56] <Al_nz1> robertmaxrees: ultimately i am going to need to loop over all the selectpickers on a given tab pane to count scores
[14:25:06] <robertmaxrees> that's not how you do it.
[14:25:18] <robertmaxrees> focus on selecting the elements to begin with.
[14:25:29] <Al_nz1> ok
[14:25:37] <robertmaxrees> so how do you select an element under another element?
[14:25:49] <Al_nz1> $('.active.tab-pane').find('.selectpicker.edu')
[14:26:11] <robertmaxrees> will all the selectpickers have the .edu class on them?
[14:26:16] <robertmaxrees> 'cause if so, boom.
[14:26:27] <Al_nz1> robertmaxrees: yes they will
[14:26:38] <robertmaxrees> fwiw I might shorten that to just .selectpicker
[14:26:47] <robertmaxrees> instead of adding extra specificity you don't need.
[14:26:58] <Al_nz1> robertmaxrees: there will be other select pickers I dont want to capture
[14:27:14] <Al_nz1> hence the edu
[14:27:18] <robertmaxrees> i might give them a better classname that you can select on in that case.
[14:28:07] <robertmaxrees> either way, now you've got it.
[14:28:23] <robertmaxrees> also: you don't need to use .each() to get all those scores.
[14:29:53] <Al_nz1> robertmaxrees: let me just run a test
[14:31:42] <Al_nz1> robertmaxrees:I was hoping this would put the results of the selector on the console : https://jsfiddle.net/bigalnz/DTcHh/37782/
[14:31:48] <Al_nz1> but I get nada
[14:31:57] <robertmaxrees> select:visible ?
[14:32:10] <robertmaxrees> none of your select pickers are visible on pageload.
[14:32:12] <Al_nz1> i can delete this
[14:33:44] <Al_nz1> grrr, now tab one is visible : https://jsfiddle.net/bigalnz/DTcHh/37784/
[14:34:03] <robertmaxrees> because you hjave a js erropr
[14:34:13] <Al_nz1> ok fixed that
[14:34:30] <robertmaxrees> i'm lost.  what are you trying to do?
[14:35:24] <Al_nz1> hold on - updating fidde
[14:39:23] <Al_nz1> https://jsfiddle.net/bigalnz/DTcHh/37787/ this doesnt work - because when a click the button the list of active tabs is empty?
[14:40:03] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[14:40:19] <robertmaxrees> what part doesn't work?
[14:41:31] <Al_nz1> https://jsfiddle.net/bigalnz/DTcHh/37790/ - click the button on pane 2
[14:41:39] <Al_nz1> it should at least list the active tab?
[14:41:46] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[14:41:49] <robertmaxrees> you're not logging it ouit.
[14:41:51] <robertmaxrees> you're just running $('.tab-pane.active').attr('id');
[14:41:58] <robertmaxrees> without wrapping it in a console.log()
[14:42:46] <Al_nz1> ahh, its not a good day
[14:42:48] <robertmaxrees> heh
[14:42:51] <Al_nz1> ok yes it lists tab2
[14:43:32] <Al_nz1> but I need to get the questions on tab3 included, because its not active but the tab isnt hidden like tab1
[14:43:46] <robertmaxrees> okay back waaaaaaay up
[14:43:50] <Al_nz1> tab1 is the odd one out that doesnt want to be included
[14:43:53] <robertmaxrees> i think you're conflating concepts.
[14:43:59] <Al_nz1> totally
[14:44:02] <robertmaxrees> "doesn't want to be included"
[14:44:09] <robertmaxrees> it sounds like you have three separate tab states.
[14:44:38] <robertmaxrees> 1. active. 2. hidden. 3. not needed.
[14:44:53] <robertmaxrees> so why wouldn't you want a tab to be selectable
[14:44:54] <robertmaxrees> "?
[14:45:20] <Al_nz1> because based on answers to other question the question on that tab arent relevant, so it gets hidden
[14:45:37] <robertmaxrees> okay.
[14:45:39] <robertmaxrees> sooooo.
[14:45:52] <robertmaxrees> so really your question was never "how do I get the visible tab"
[14:46:10] <robertmaxrees> your question was "how do I get all tabs except for the ones that are irrelevant?"
[14:46:42] <Al_nz1> ok
[14:46:57] <robertmaxrees> does that make sense?
[14:47:26] <Al_nz1> yip
[14:49:23] <robertmaxrees> so
[14:49:47] <robertmaxrees> instead of using .hide() - why not addClass called not-needed or something like that.
[14:49:52] <robertmaxrees> and use that to show/hide stuff?
[14:50:36] <SideFX> I'm trying to get an AJAX call to work which is failing but I can't figure out how to get a meaningful error message back
[14:50:59] <robertmaxrees> SideFX pass the three args to the .catch() callback and look at the values.
[14:51:08] <Al_nz1> right, so for each tab that I do want to score, lets say I add a class "score" - I can still hide the pane, but its easier to select which tabs have questions I want to score?
[14:51:32] <robertmaxrees> Al_nz1 or you just select tabs that DON'T have the not-needed class.
[14:51:33] <robertmaxrees> either/or.
[14:53:44] <robertmaxrees> Al_nz1 something like https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/y3c8391z/
[14:53:57] <robertmaxrees> SideFX also: you can share your code here and we can make some guesses :)
[14:58:42] <Al_nz1> robertmaxrees: ok. Thats great. Now to the second part - the select pickers?
[15:00:52] <robertmaxrees> you want all the select pickers under $('.tab-pane').not('.not-needed') right?
[15:01:19] <Al_nz1> Each tab has a bunch of select pickers on them with .selectpicker.edu - when they all have a value (1 or 0) then then a final score box shows a total. until all the nessecary select pickers (ie the select pickers on a need tab) are answered the total should show UNCOMPLETE. The only way i could see to do that was to loop over the needed pickers to check if they have a value?
[15:01:45] <FrozenFire> Is there a selector I can use for firing a handler when the user double-clicks an arbitrary "word" within an element? The "word" is just text separated by whitespace.
[15:01:53] <Al_nz1> hence i used .each
[15:02:31] <taplar> FrozenFire: not that i'm aware of
[15:02:54] <taplar> you could capture the clicking, but there isn't a straight forward way to determine what was clicked
[15:07:39] <Al_nz1> robertmaxrees: that make sense?
[15:16:33] <robertmaxrees> Al_nz1 sorry - busy
[15:19:09] <Al_nz1> k
[16:04:29] <Al_nz1> whats wrong with the syntax here : https://jsfiddle.net/bigalnz/y3c8391z/5/
[16:04:42] <Al_nz1> when I click the button on tab 2
[16:04:46] <robertmaxrees> $('.tab-pane.score').each('.selectpicker.edu',
[16:04:50] <Al_nz1> I expect a list of select picker ids?
[16:04:53] <robertmaxrees> that doesn't do what you think it does.
[16:05:09] <Al_nz1> robertmaxrees: doh!
[16:05:11] <robertmaxrees> https://api.jquery.com/each/
[16:06:37] <Al_nz1> robertmaxrees: right so you cant pass in another selector
[16:06:49] <Al_nz1> nest the each's?
[16:07:04] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[16:07:22] <robertmaxrees> you want all child .selectpicker.edu, right?
[16:07:31] <Al_nz1> yes
[16:07:31] <robertmaxrees> and do somethign with each of those?
[16:07:34] <robertmaxrees> sooo.
[16:07:35] <Al_nz1> yes
[16:07:39] <robertmaxrees> you've done this many times before.
[16:07:44] <robertmaxrees> how do you select a child element?
[16:08:19] <Al_nz1> .children('.selectpicker.edu',....
[16:08:30] <robertmaxrees> those are direct children.
[16:08:35] <robertmaxrees> .find() works, too.
[16:08:41] <robertmaxrees> but you don't pass a callback to that part.
[16:09:34] <Al_nz1> ok, lemme see if I can make this go
[16:09:44] <robertmaxrees> it's pretty straightforward
[16:10:29] <Al_nz1> for you maybe
[16:10:47] <robertmaxrees> ?
[16:11:27] <robertmaxrees> where are you getting lost with selectors?
[16:12:07] <Al_nz1> So i do this:
[16:12:07] <Al_nz1> https://jsfiddle.net/bigalnz/y3c8391z/8/
[16:12:29] <robertmaxrees> okay - so there's a really basic concept to grasp here.
[16:12:31] <Al_nz1> now how do I work on each one
[16:12:39] <robertmaxrees> $() returns a jquery object, right?
[16:12:46] <Al_nz1> yes
[16:12:57] <robertmaxrees> and that lets you use things like .find(), .each() etc, right
[16:12:58] <robertmaxrees> ?
[16:13:02] <Al_nz1> yes
[16:13:15] <robertmaxrees> the majority of the time, those methods also return jquery objects.
[16:13:20] <Al_nz1> ok
[16:13:28] <robertmaxrees> so what does that tell you?
[16:14:03] <Al_nz1> $('.tab-pane.score').find('.selectpicker.edu') returns a jquery object?
[16:14:07] <robertmaxrees> yes,.
[16:14:11] <robertmaxrees> most jquery methods do.
[16:14:15] <robertmaxrees> the majority of them.
[16:15:00] <Al_nz1> and how does that help me total the scores?
[16:15:08] <robertmaxrees> well.
[16:15:13] <robertmaxrees> you wanted to do .each(), right?
[16:15:17] <Al_nz1> yes
[16:15:20] <robertmaxrees> sooo...
[16:15:22] <robertmaxrees> why not use it?
[16:15:23] <Al_nz1> (this).each?
[16:15:27] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[16:15:33] <robertmaxrees> where are you getting $(this) from?
[16:15:46] <robertmaxrees> how would you use each normally?
[16:15:46] <Al_nz1> after : $('.tab-pane.score').find('.selectpicker.edu') can I do a this?
[16:16:00] <robertmaxrees> how would you normally use each?
[16:16:05] <Al_nz1> oh so like this: $('.tab-pane.score').find('.selectpicker.edu').each
[16:16:10] <robertmaxrees> ^^^^
[16:17:22] <Al_nz1> ok - testing
[16:18:49] <Al_nz1> beautiful
[16:18:51] <Al_nz1> thank you
[16:18:55] <robertmaxrees> so now.
[16:19:47] <robertmaxrees> what if you could get an array of those numbers.
[16:23:31] <Al_nz1> robertmaxrees: I need to get not just a total - but if any questions are unanswered
[16:23:54] <Al_nz1> will that work with array?
[16:26:12] <robertmaxrees> there are a few ways to do that :)
[16:27:10] <robertmaxrees> i'd start with that second half.
[16:28:17] <Al_nz1> well the current way I have working is each time I loop over the questions i have counters for the total score, number of unanswered questions
[16:28:33] <robertmaxrees> do you even care about the total score if any of the questions are unanswered?
[16:28:48] <Al_nz1> no
[16:29:09] <robertmaxrees> right, so ignoring scores for a second.
[16:29:24] <robertmaxrees> how would you determine if all questions were answered?
[16:29:25] <robertmaxrees> :)
[16:30:07] <Al_nz1> var val = parseInt(this.value.trim() || "0", 10);
[16:30:17] <robertmaxrees> backing away from that.
[16:30:28] <Al_nz1> questionsnotanswered += (this.value.trim() === '' ? 1 :0 );
[16:30:35] <robertmaxrees> ....
[16:30:37] <robertmaxrees> yeah so.
[16:30:39] <robertmaxrees> you don't want that.
[16:30:39] <robertmaxrees> heh
[16:31:16] <robertmaxrees> you basically want 2 things:
[16:31:35] <robertmaxrees> the number of selects, and the number of selects with an answer.
[16:31:43] <Al_nz1> there is actually another level of complexity, but I dont know if you want to know about that yet ;-)
[16:32:03] <robertmaxrees> the whole scoring system thing?
[16:32:20] <Al_nz1> yes
[16:32:38] <robertmaxrees> yeah, we can account for that in a minute heh.
[16:32:42] <robertmaxrees> let's start with each section.
[16:32:45] <Al_nz1> ok
[16:32:46] <robertmaxrees> so./
[16:33:02] <robertmaxrees> so does my solution above make sense?
[16:34:08] <Al_nz1> yes
[16:34:16] <robertmaxrees> so start with that.
[16:34:41] <Al_nz1> the number of selects is easy .length ?
[16:34:53] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[16:34:59] <Al_nz1> the number with a score......hmmm
[16:35:10] <robertmaxrees> i'd use .filter() for that.
[16:35:21] <robertmaxrees> here's a freebie: https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/y3c8391z/10/
[16:37:14] <Al_nz1> so the return this.value; wont return anything if its NaN
[16:37:21] <Al_nz1> hence a simple count?
[16:37:34] <robertmaxrees> erm
[16:37:36] <robertmaxrees> it won't be NaN
[16:37:46] <Al_nz1> well it wont be anything
[16:37:51] <robertmaxrees> right.
[16:38:01] <robertmaxrees> nothing != NaN
[16:38:02] <Al_nz1> ok, so you get a count of answered ones
[16:38:23] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[16:39:02] <robertmaxrees> so now you can answer the question "are all of these answered or not"
[16:39:04] <Al_nz1> so then later you test for allAnswers.length == answereswithselections.length
[16:39:30] <robertmaxrees> even better - make a function that does that for you.
[16:41:28] <Al_nz1> ok - working on it :-)
[16:42:06] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/y3c8391z/11/
