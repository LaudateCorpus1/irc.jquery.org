[00:17:11] <nights> hi
[00:17:16] <nights> i have a problem with ajaxStart
[00:17:21] <nights> can't get it to trigger more than once
[00:17:47] <nights> i've tried $.ajaxSetup({global:true});  , doesnt help
[00:20:10] <nights> ajaxComplete seem to be working
[00:31:00] <nights> but it triggers too early (wtf!)
[02:03:01] <WhirledPress> if you cache a jquery object and then the contents to which it refers are reordered, does the jquery object keep it's cached order of contents?
[02:12:55] <Cork> WhirledPress: the jquery object is just an array, it isn't a dom collection
[02:13:10] <Cork> so it doesn't react to dom changes, as long as you don't use methods to traverse
[02:14:13] <WhirledPress> Cork, thanks for the reply. So using .each() on the "array" won't give me the elements in the chached order...right?
[02:14:28] <Cork> each isn't a traversal
[02:14:35] <Cork> so yes it will be in the array order
[02:15:11] <WhirledPress> Which are the traversal methods?   .next() and  .prev() ?
[02:15:29] <WhirledPress> or rather, where can I look them up. Don't mean to hog your time.
[02:16:03] <Cork> children, next, prev, nextAll, prevAll, nextUntil, prevUntil, parent, closest, find (is the ones i can think of right now)
[02:16:11] <Cork> oh, parents
[02:16:54] <WhirledPress> https://api.jquery.com/category/traversing/
[02:17:26] <Cork> heh, that's not even close to correct
[02:17:32] <WhirledPress> pfew
[02:17:38] <WhirledPress> cause .each is in there
[02:17:52] <Cork> .add doesn't traverse at all, it just merge the two objects :/
[02:18:06] <Cork> and .each is just a loop for objects and arrays
[02:18:16] <Cork> doesn't care about the dom at all
[02:18:34] <Cork> ah, but .contents() is a traversal
[02:18:53] <Cork> and offsetParent
[02:19:01] <Cork> and siblings
[02:19:20] <Cork> basically every command where its function is based on dom relation
[02:19:25] <Cork> that's traversal
[02:19:43] <WhirledPress> do you know of any good tuts on scrolling divs? I am having the worst time understanding it
[02:28:50] <WhirledPress> thanks for your help with traversals
[02:29:02] <Cork> WhirledPress: scrolling divs?
[02:29:13] <Cork> not even sure what that is suppose to be
[02:29:51] <WhirledPress> a div that scrolls. All the tuts I have found are for scrolling the page.  .scrollTop is odd with a relatively positioned scrollable div
[02:30:17] <Cork> it is?
[02:30:19] <Cork> why?
[02:30:26] <WhirledPress> I took your advice and made my site work without js.
[02:30:50] <WhirledPress> but now I am adding some unnecessary, but nice enhancements with js
[02:31:26] <WhirledPress> so I want my "section menu" nav elements to update as the content scrolls
[02:31:46] <WhirledPress> so if you scroll past article 3, the menu reflects it
[02:32:37] <Cork> and where does scrollable elements come into this?
[02:32:41] <WhirledPress> plus I want smooth animated scrolling for articles within sections. So clicking on the section nav scrolls the contents to feature the article.
[02:33:39] <WhirledPress> trying to figure out how to animate scrollTop to the correct position has been unbelievably difficult for me.
[02:33:57] <WhirledPress> I mean, I have spent hours and hours working on it and I am sure I am not doing it right.
[02:37:12] <Cork> well you will have to scroll each element separately
[02:37:17] <Cork> the overflow parents each have there own scrollTop and you will have to grab the offset for the child relative to the parent and animate that
[03:11:03] <Kartagis> ahoy
[03:11:32] <Kartagis> I have a class across several lines
[03:12:07] <Kartagis> can I change some of these classes based on the .text() property?
[03:14:07] <Cork> a class?
[03:14:40] <Cork> Kartagis: not sure what the question is, you think you could make a jsfiddle?
[03:15:22] <Kartagis> Cork: I made something like this https://jsfiddle.net/ens68sz4/
[03:15:42] <Cork> ah
[03:15:54] <Cork> Kartagis: not really
[03:16:27] <Cork> you would have to either use regex to check for partial existance, or clone the element and remove child nodes
[03:16:28] <robarbe> hello guys
[03:16:37] <Kartagis> hrm, okay thanks
[03:16:42] <Cork> Kartagis: also never EVER use .attr to set class
[03:16:52] <Kartagis> why?
[03:17:12] <Cork> cause it means nothing can ever add a class to that element
[03:17:20] <Cork> use addClass/removeClass instead
[03:17:35] <Kartagis> okay
[03:18:44] <Kadigan_KSB> Just out of curiosity -- is there a way to rectify such a situation (something setting class via .attr() directly) w/o finding and removing the offending code?
[03:18:46] <Cork> Kartagis: this is the closest you can do to get what you're looking for, but it is a bit messy https://jsfiddle.net/ens68sz4/1/
[03:19:17] <Cork> Kartagis: controlling structures based on text in the elements is normally a bad idea, cause it means if the content of the page gets changed the structure will break
[03:19:40] <Cork> Kadigan: no
[03:20:00] <Cork> the other classes that was on the element are gone, and there is no way to find them unless they are stored somewhere manually
[03:20:56] <Kartagis> thanks Cork
[03:21:19] <Cork> it has the same problem as event handlers doing return false; or stopPropagation()/stopImidiatePropagation()
[03:21:23] <Kadigan> No, I get that, but once code calls .attr() to set class, I can still use addClass() right? Because what you said sounded pretty bad, but now that I think about it, it just means that they -will- be able to, just that if this code fires, it'll all be wiped out.
[03:21:45] <Cork> Kadigan: sure, you can, but when .attr gets called the data is gone
[03:22:01] <Kadigan> (which could be useful in a number of situations, notably when you need to clear the 'class' attribute in a hurry)
[03:22:17] <Cork> the problem with .attr('class') isn't that it makes addClass impossible to use, it is that it will always reset the other classes it doesn't know about
[03:22:23] <Kadigan> Okay, thanks. I had a moment of terror there for a second.
[03:22:31] <Cork> Kadigan: you shouldn't ever need that
[03:22:48] <Cork> code should never care about classes it doesn't know about
[03:22:56] <Kadigan> Probably, sure.
[03:23:05] <Cork> and it why it should use .removeClass with the class names it knows it doesn't want
[03:23:45] <Kadigan> We're moving into "good design principles", and I'm not really good in those as far as freenode channels are concerned. Thanks.
[03:23:59] <Cork> return false; stopPropagation/stopImidiatePropagation causes problem cause it means no other code can ever attach an event handler to event related to that element
[03:24:16] <Cork> Kadigan: it is actually a bit more then good design
[03:24:49] <Cork> cause the use of .attr('class'), return false and the like means "i know what this page is going to need for all possible futures"
[03:25:06] <Cork> and that is just never true, and that means when someone will have to fix that this code will cause problems
[03:25:42] <Kadigan> True, agreed. Which is why I usually break these principles w/o fanfare. ;P
[03:25:59] <Cork> stopPropagation() has bit me a long time ago, (i did the mistake on a project) and it just wasn't fixable when the problems started to show
[03:26:17] <Cork> ended up having to scrap the entire site and all the js (and it was a big site)
[03:26:43] <Cork> principles is just "it will be annoying", this is just unfixable if you're unlucky
[03:27:04] <Cork> and that is why i said it goes a bit beyond that
[03:27:44] <Cork> good design principles are things like use {} after ifs or name your variables to tell what they contain
[03:27:55] <Cork> the problem if you don't follow them is local, and doable to fix
[03:28:28] <Cork> if you break this problem you might very well have to write the site from scratch
[03:28:42] <Kadigan> No, I get it. It's just that it's usually much cleaner to just strip the classes when some piece of code, despite doing exactly what it's supposed to do, is interfering with what the client wants done, and I don't have a few days to untangle their minified spaghetti.
[03:29:19] <Kadigan> But like I said, I'm not really good for those discussions because I discuss specific, typically outlying scenarios, and it's not educational.
[03:29:38] <Cork> Kadigan: that is only true if the code you write is living in a vacuum, if there will never ever be a separate event handler or separate lib doing anything on the page
[03:29:40] <Kadigan> I will keep what you've said in mind.
[03:30:00] <Cork> and that is normally not true, and is why it is best to not develop for that situation
[03:30:13] <Kadigan> True, I agree, it's essentially pushing the responsibility to fix this to the next person that comes around.
[03:30:21] <Cork> and above all it might be true now, but will most likely not be true a year from now
[03:30:36] <Kadigan> But the point is, try explaining "We should really not do this" to my boss. ;P
[03:30:47] <Kadigan> "We should really not take their money and tell them to go elsewhere."
[03:30:48] <Cork> ya, and they might not be able to fix it cause of technical depth
[03:31:23] <Cork> so they will have to resort to hacks, and i've seen plenty of ppl with that exact problem come here
[03:31:54] <Kadigan> Unfortunately, as a programmer, the problems I typically face are strangely not programming-related in principle. :/
[03:32:05] <Cork> where they serialize the old function or use setInterval to check for the state of the element or...
[03:32:36] <Kadigan> They're usually politics "do {X} because I need to present on Friday" or business "do {X} before Thursday or we don't get paid".
[03:32:42] <Cork> Kadigan: that would be one thing if it took any more time to do this the right way
[03:32:48] <Cork> but in these cases it just doesn't
[03:33:33] <Kadigan> My boss is optimistic in nature, and that's really, really bad. If I tell him some change can take anywhere from 10 minutes to 2 days, he usually calls the client and tells them "yeah, I'll call you in 30min"
[03:34:10] <Cork> ya, been there too
[03:34:12] <Kadigan> (because he usually phones me when I'm on the can, or eating dinner, or something, and fires off a "Hey, if they gave us access to their website, would we be able to fix {X} for them?")
[03:34:36] <Kadigan> He speaks in terms of ideas and opportunities. ;P
[03:34:39] <Cork> but again, that only matters if ex. using .removeClass took a second more time then using .attr('class', '')
[03:35:15] <Cork> time optimists isn't an excuse to do sloppy work and not trying to do the right thing
[03:35:15] <Kadigan> Yeah, I know, but if I really needed to just strip all classes, writing a .each() would take more than just .attr("class", "")
[03:35:29] <Cork> you don't need an each
[03:35:41] <Kadigan> I don't? I was under the impression that I did.
[03:35:51] <Cork> just write .removeClass('class1 class2 class3 class4 class1812934')
[03:35:58] <Cork> and if any/all of them are there they are removed
[03:36:19] <Kadigan> The problem is never computer time, mind. It's my time. If I can hack it in 5min vs fixing it in 2h, guess which option I'm supposed to take.
[03:36:22] <Kadigan> (good to know!)
[03:36:35] <Cork> ya, but again, this doesn't take more time
[03:37:12] <Cork> same for all those problems i talked about here
[03:37:24] <Cork> it is just about thinking about the problem in the right way
[03:37:31] <Cork> not time consumption
[03:37:59] <Kadigan> Yes, I can see that. But yeah, ultimately fixing this would involve adding an array of classes exempt from clearing, reading the classes attached, removing them, and then doing something to that object. -- if I wanted to make sure nothing else would apply a class to this object unless it was necessary (for whatever reason)
[03:38:21] <Kadigan> I would still argue .attr() would be faster and cleaner here. But yeah, right now I'm taking the devil's side in the argument.
[03:38:37] <Kadigan> I learned something new, and that's important.
[03:38:54] <Cork> but that is exactly the problem, you should never "make sure nothing else apply a class"
[03:39:21] <Cork> that is the core of the problem why .attr('class') should never be used
[03:40:13] <Kadigan> Yeah, well - that's the problem, isn't it. "should" and "what's good for business" aren't always down the same path, because if someone else down the line breaks something in functionality -we- coded, guess who they're gonna call to complain? ;]
[03:41:16] <Cork> Kadigan: and your code shouldn't break unless someone adds code to the page without checking if the _same element_ they are working on still work
[03:41:32] <Cork> .attr('class') is just a way to say "it is there problem, sucks to be them"
[03:41:51] <Kadigan> In principle, I agree with you. In practice however, I've learned to safeguard my code in ways that I probably shouldn't, because I don't have time to deal with morons (and if that makes it a little bit more difficult for someone down the line, I'm ultimately not paid to make it easier for them -- regardless of any moral principles).
[03:42:08] <Cork> it isn't principle, it is in hard experience
[03:43:01] <Cork> writing web code in a state of mind that you know everything that is always going to be needed for this specific element is a grantee to cause you problem, and soon
[03:43:15] <Kadigan> I know... Unfortunately, I know.
[03:43:20] <Cork> ...
[03:43:21] <Kadigan> It would be much easier if I didn't.
[03:43:44] <Cork> then why are you being lazy and just punt the problem as "i can't do anything about it"?
[03:44:02] <Cork> if doing things in a way that didn't break took more time, sure, but it doesn't
[03:44:16] <Cork> normally it is actually the other way around
[03:45:19] <Cork> it kinda irritates me when ppl goes into a "i'm on a tight time schedule so i can't do a good job, so i'm not even going to try"
[03:45:22] <Kadigan> Not from my perspective. But maybe that's a fallacy of mine.
[03:45:30] <Cork> cause that is nothing except lazy
[03:47:04] <Kadigan> Bad, bad time management. Here's an example: we needed to make a presentation for the next day. I got in at around 9 and told him to throw his phone away for the day. But nooooo. By the time we were done putting out fires that came in via alarm calls (for unrelated stuff), it was 5 PM (we ended up working on it 'till 8 AM the next day)
[03:47:23] <Cork> ... stop blaming time management
[03:47:26] <Cork> it has nothing to do with it
[03:48:09] <Kadigan> So what -am- I supposed to do? Tell him it's impossible to do in the time frame given?
[03:48:19] <Kadigan> Tell him I can't do it "in the meantime" between other stuff?
[03:48:27] <Woet> you say that as if it's insane
[03:48:28] <Kadigan> I already do. Isn't helping.
[03:48:32] <Cork> you are suppose to do the best you can with the time you have
[03:48:48] <Cork> not go into "i don't need to think cause i don't have time"
[03:49:16] <Kadigan> Well, that simply goes to show that you're a better programmer than I am.
[03:49:21] <Cork> we all have time frames that force us to do suboptimal things, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't try
[03:50:41] <Kadigan> Yeah, I know I'm fighting a lost battle. Like I said, I'll keep what you said in mind.
[03:51:35] <Kadigan> Thanks for caring.
[03:53:08] <Cork> i care cause i keep helping ppl that have to mop up afterwards
[05:42:33] <WhirledPress> there has got to be a better way to do this:    var el_link=$("a[href='"+el.attr("id")+"']");  any suggestions?
[05:42:59] <WhirledPress> nvm, forgot the #...
[09:15:02] <phone> hey
[09:15:52] <phone> in jquery mobile 1.4.5, data-icon property does not work
[09:16:00] <phone> is it deprecated?
[09:17:46] <phone> <a href="index.html" data-role="button" data-icon="delete">Delete</a> this way
[09:17:53] <phone> does not work
[09:20:11] <phone> <a href="index.html" data-role="button" data-icon="delete">Delete</a> this does not work in jquery mobile1 1.4.5
[09:20:37] <phone> there are no data-icon data-role property recognintion
[09:24:13] <phone> http://demos.jquerymobile.com/1.4.4/button-markup/ ok
[10:05:29] <a_ok> How is .off() suposed to work? I have an element with two eventhandlers on them (according to firefox inspecter). I try remove everything with $('footer a.dropdown-toggle').off();. Both eventhandlers are still there...
[10:54:06] <cjohnson> If I have a collection of nodes, and a reference to one specific node, how can I find the next node in the collection, if any?
[10:54:29] <cjohnson> I think I can do the finding the next node part, just not sure how to find the node I have a ref to
[10:54:46] <cjohnson> can I just indexOf the jq object?
[11:02:33] <vaeringjar> hej jquery folks. having an issue with the datepicker in a bootstrap modal in firefox not allowing the yearselect to change. any help most appreciated. =)
[11:03:38] <cjohnson> Here's what I have: https://jsfiddle.net/j2xycr1f/
[11:03:47] <cjohnson> seems kludgy, any recommendations on how to use .next() to clean this up?
[11:07:15] <Cork> cjohnson: col.eq(col.index(node) + 1)
[11:07:33] <Cork> .next will use dom traversal not collection
[11:12:52] <cjohnson> I thought there was also a way to use it on a collection too
[11:12:57] <cjohnson> I'm sure I've done something similar before
[11:13:09] <cjohnson> that didn't involve all this slicing and .eq() business. but maybe I'm wrong
[11:14:37] <Cork> cjohnson: not that i know of at least
[12:20:00] <robertmaxrees> weeeeeeee
[12:49:25] <uskerine> hi, in revolution slider, is it possible to check if it is compressed (for mobile/small tablet view) or expanded (full screen)?
[12:50:53] <robertmaxrees> we'd probably have to do what you'd have to do.
[12:50:55] <robertmaxrees> check the docs :)
[12:52:11] <uskerine> forget it
[12:52:14] <uskerine> it seems easier
[12:52:33] <uskerine> how can I check if #menu-icon has attribute display: none; or not?
[12:52:55] <robertmaxrees> $('#menu-icon').css('display')
[12:53:33] <uskerine> thanks
[12:59:33] <uskerine> but robertmaxrees, that checks if #menu-icon has 'display' style
[12:59:39] <uskerine> what about checking if display is block or none?
[12:59:53] <robertmaxrees> ...
[12:59:59] <robertmaxrees> you compare the value of that.
[13:00:05] <robertmaxrees> using an if...
[13:01:03] <uskerine> :!
[13:01:43] <robertmaxrees> not sure what isn't clear about that heh
[13:11:20] <GeekMonkey> Hey
[13:11:28] <robertmaxrees> good morning
[13:11:34] <GeekMonkey> can someone help me with a scroll script
[13:12:02] <robertmaxrees> just ask the channel - if somebody can help, they will :)
[13:12:25] <GeekMonkey> https://pastebin.com/3hh3iDLc
[13:12:29] <GeekMonkey> This is my script
[13:12:39] <GeekMonkey> works great to scroll to an ID
[13:12:57] <uskerine> is there a way to detect when user resizes or rotates screen?
[13:13:08] <GeekMonkey> but I want it to stop scrolling if your try to scroll up or down with the mouse wheel
[13:13:12] <robertmaxrees> uskerine there's a resize event.
[13:13:31] <robertmaxrees> GeekMonkey $("html, body").bind("scroll mousedown DOMMouseScroll mousewheel keyup", function(){
[13:13:38] <robertmaxrees> this should do that for you.
[13:14:10] <GeekMonkey> irobertmaxrees so that is working but if I let it scroll all the way it goes jumping for a couple seconds
[13:14:25] <robertmaxrees> "goes jumping"?
[13:14:33] <GeekMonkey> if try to stop it mid way it works fine with that script....
[13:14:38] <GeekMonkey> ya jumpy
[13:14:45] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[13:14:54] <robertmaxrees> can you make a fiddle to show what you mean?
[13:14:59] <uskerine> thanks robertmaxrees, I'll google for it
[13:14:59] <GeekMonkey> like i try to scroll but it just moves a couple pixels up and down
[13:15:18] <robertmaxrees> GeekMonkey $("html, body").bind("scroll mousedown DOMMouseScroll mousewheel keyup", function(e){ e.preventDefault() });
[13:15:19] <robertmaxrees> trry that.
[13:19:14] <GeekMonkey> https://jsfiddle.net/aq6f2Lkg/
[13:19:30] <robertmaxrees> see what i suggested above?
[13:20:23] <robertmaxrees> also: who do you have so many handlers bound?
[13:20:27] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/aq6f2Lkg/1/
[13:20:28] <GeekMonkey> is that instead of the .stop?
[13:20:31] <robertmaxrees> this should do exactly what you need.
[13:21:12] <GeekMonkey> robertmaxrees on yours I can't stop it mid way with my mouse
[13:21:23] <robertmaxrees> errm.
[13:21:24] <robertmaxrees> wait.
[13:21:37] <robertmaxrees> then i'm misunderstanding something.
[13:21:45] <robertmaxrees> heh - what's the jittery thing you're talking about?
[13:22:59] <GeekMonkey> I guess it must be a conflict with something on the site.... because in the fiddle it is working fine
[13:33:05] <uskerine> is there any option to send information from a contact form without PHP or other server side stuff
[13:33:05] <uskerine> ?
[13:34:14] <pavonia> Send to where?
[13:35:41] <uskerine> to an email address
[13:37:51] <robertmaxrees> need server side stuff.
[14:19:37] <printForever> When I try to see what is the var value in the console I'm getting ReferenceError varName is not defined.

[14:21:33] <printForever> I'm checking it in an if
[14:21:36] <printForever> its an IF
[14:21:37] <robertmaxrees> submitClicked = 0 sets the var.

[14:22:19] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/w85czyya/
[14:22:31] <printForever> and I was constantly asking myself why is it always going for the last one
[14:22:54] <robertmaxrees> you're gonna get some strange behavior with what you had.
[14:23:09] <printForever> yeah...
[14:23:13] <printForever> thanks for catching that
[14:23:16] <printForever> thank you!
[14:23:47] <printForever> I know = is checking for value, == is checking for type and === is checking for all.
[14:23:52] <robertmaxrees> err.
[14:23:53] <robertmaxrees> nope.,
[14:23:57] <robertmaxrees> = sets vars.
[14:24:00] <robertmaxrees> always.
[14:24:09] <printForever> :(
[14:24:09] <robertmaxrees> == checks the value with coercion
[14:24:13] <robertmaxrees> === doesn't coerce
[14:24:17] <printForever> :(((((
[14:24:49] <MikeD_> is there reason to use == instead of === ?
[14:25:10] <printForever> === is better
[14:25:10] <robertmaxrees> some people use it for comparing to undefined to catch null, as well.
[14:25:23] <robertmaxrees> but in general you always want ===
[14:25:51] <printForever> robertmaxrees: thank you!
[14:26:42] <robertmaxrees> sure
[14:28:53] <Stutters> when having a div#main that gets filled with .html(someDOM) after ajax returned some someDOM from a php-script.. how can I add an event handler to a dynamically created .test within someDOM?
[14:29:12] <robertmaxrees> Stutters dont - use a delegated listener instead :)
[14:29:29] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events and http://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/ cover the topic nicely.
[14:29:43] <Stutters> robertmaxrees: I hear that name for the very first time :) can you give me a kick in the right direction? :)
[14:29:50] <Stutters> robertmaxrees: oh, thanks, you're fast :O
[14:29:52] <robertmaxrees> :)
[14:29:56] <robertmaxrees> we get that questiuon a lot.
[14:30:25] <Stutters> robertmaxrees: you have that answer on [CTRL] + [V]? :)
[14:30:43] <robertmaxrees> nah.  browser history ;)
[14:31:44] <Stutters> robertmaxrees: :) now I wonder why delegated events aren't the standard *reads on*
[14:31:49] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[14:31:55] <robertmaxrees> what do you mean?
[14:32:39] <printForever> robertmaxrees: do I need to use xhr to submit form?
[14:32:49] <robertmaxrees> printForever that depends.
[14:33:00] <printForever> Hm...
[14:33:08] <robertmaxrees> if you don't want the page to reload, yes.
[14:33:13] <printForever> I need to send it to PHP but I dont want page to relaod
[14:33:15] <printForever> oh o
[14:33:17] <printForever> ok
[14:33:19] <robertmaxrees> heh, then yeah.
[14:33:27] <printForever> any simple example?
[14:34:19] <robertmaxrees> http://learn.jquery.com/ajax/ajax-and-forms/
[14:34:24] <robertmaxrees> pretty basic idea.
[14:35:58] <printForever> ok, and I need to preventDefault on any click
[14:36:07] <printForever> on any submit
[14:36:13] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[14:36:15] <robertmaxrees> pretty easy stuff.,
[14:36:20] <printForever> ok
[14:38:43] <Stutters> oh god, my internet is terrible right now :/
[14:39:44] <printForever> much mor simple
[14:39:44] <printForever> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16616250/form-submit-with-ajax-passing-form-data-to-php-without-page-refresh
[14:40:02] <robertmaxrees> more simple than what?
[14:41:56] <printForever> than the jquery.com
[14:42:01] <robertmaxrees> lol
[14:42:22] <robertmaxrees> the learning center covers a lot more information to help you understand what's available to you.
[14:42:25] <robertmaxrees> otherwise you'
[14:42:36] <robertmaxrees> *you'll end up with questions that are probably answered there.
[14:42:40] <robertmaxrees> but whatever floats your boat :)
[14:52:15] <Stutters> robertmaxrees: don't mind me, my router is going rogue today...
[14:52:42] <robertmaxrees> okay?
[16:14:13] <hlve> what is the point in .noop?
[16:14:34] <hlve> why would someone use it? it's a function that does nothing.
[16:15:16] <robertmaxrees> it's a way to fulfill the needs of a method signature without changing the method itself.
[16:15:58] <robertmaxrees> or to be explicit in your code about what should happen when not callback is given.,
[16:17:33] <hlve> but if it's simply being called inside of an event?
[16:17:43] <hlve> eh
[16:17:48] <hlve> Not sure I understand.
[16:17:59] <robertmaxrees> just pointing out where it can be used.
[16:18:27] <robertmaxrees> some plugins/methods assume you pass in a callback.
[16:36:00] <Cork> hlve: function doSomething(callback) { callback=callback || $.noop; $.ajax(url).done(callback); }
[16:36:18] <robertmaxrees> basically.
[16:36:25] <Cork> a bit of a convoluted example as ajax uses deferred, but i hope it makes it understandable
[16:36:45] <hlve> so, if we're using: onLoad: $.noop,
[16:37:09] <hlve> and call this.onLoad in a function
[16:37:15] <Cork> hlve: think of $.noop as a fallback function for when you want something to be optional
[16:38:13] <hlve> so failsafe to prevent errors if a a function is expecting a callback?
[16:38:31] <hlve> it could be used for, rather*^?
[16:38:43] <robertmaxrees> like we've been saying, yeah.,
[16:38:46] <Cork> hlve: it is so you don't have to have if(callback) { callback(); } all though the function
[16:38:52] <hlve> ah
[16:38:55] <hlve> clever.
[16:39:09] <hlve> robertmaxrees, sorry. had trouble fully grasping it.
[16:39:16] <robertmaxrees> heh :)
[16:39:48] <hlve> never used it prior. never had a need.
[16:40:13] <Cork> i used it a lot before deferred/$.Callback existed
[16:40:18] <Cork> not so much now days
[16:48:44] <printForever> robertmaxrees: are you here?
[16:49:03] <robertmaxrees> along with like 470 someodd other folks.
[16:49:29] <printForever> https://pastebin.com/rxZsyaED
[16:49:38] <printForever> I've finished the script
[16:49:48] <printForever> after missing the most obvious thing with = and ===
[16:50:05] <printForever> so, right now the form is giving me Not found when I try to submit the form.
[16:50:44] <printForever> I've added subscribe.php in the root then I tried playing around with the path but I would always get Not found.
[16:50:57] <robertmaxrees> well i mean.
[16:51:09] <robertmaxrees> where are you seeing the not found?
[16:51:56] <printForever> in the console
[16:52:15] <printForever> "The following error occurred: " + textStatus, errorThrown
[16:52:29] <robertmaxrees> alright.
[16:52:41] <robertmaxrees> and are you getting a 404 in your network tab for that request?
[16:52:49] <printForever> and now I realized I've put the subscribe.php in the theme folder of the WP
[16:52:51] <robertmaxrees> url: '../subscribe.php', this looks suspect to me.
[16:52:55] <printForever> instead of the root
[16:53:05] <robertmaxrees> url: '/subscribe.php', try this and make sure the file is in the right palce.
[16:53:08] <printForever> yes... I just realized why I was missing the point
[16:53:12] <printForever> yup
[16:53:13] <robertmaxrees> heh
[16:53:17] <printForever> thanks! :D
[16:53:27] <printForever> its infinitely easier to ask a question here
[16:53:39] <printForever> even though I find the answer on my own, sometimes, its much easier to ask
[16:53:49] <robertmaxrees> that's called Rubber Duck Debugging
[16:54:15] <robertmaxrees> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging
[16:58:41] <printForever> ok :)
[16:58:55] <robertmaxrees> i have a little R2 figure on my desk for that exact purpose.
[16:59:32] <printForever> hahaha :)
[16:59:35] <printForever> I will have to get one
[16:59:43] <printForever> can you "read" this to me?
[16:59:46] <printForever> https://pastebin.com/vPmKPWE6
[16:59:50] <robertmaxrees> uh...
[16:59:55] <robertmaxrees> wut
[17:00:00] <printForever> I'm not getting what is the error
[17:00:04] <printForever> where its located
[17:00:14] <printForever> I moved the file to the correct location
[17:00:25] <printForever> but I'm still getting error, Not found
[17:00:27] <robertmaxrees> "The following error occurred: error Not Found  blog.js:285:21"
[17:00:37] <robertmaxrees> that's what that's telling you.
[17:00:42] <printForever> thats the request.fail(function (jqXHR, textStatus, errorThrown) {
[17:00:54] <printForever> but I don't understand what is he not finding
[17:00:56] <printForever> the file
[17:00:58] <printForever> the method
[17:00:58] <robertmaxrees> did you update both the file location and the url: for the ajax call?
[17:01:01] <printForever> the... aliens...
[17:01:03] <printForever> yes
[17:01:12] <robertmaxrees> then something is stioll out of sync.
[17:01:24] <robertmaxrees> go to your network tab of your dev tools
[17:01:54] <robertmaxrees> and find the specific requestg.
[17:02:04] <printForever> ok
[17:02:17] <robertmaxrees> is the pathj that it's requesing valid?
[17:02:53] <printForever> I need that R2D2 figure...
[17:02:56] <printForever> You were 100% right
[17:03:00] <robertmaxrees> heh
[17:03:02] <printForever> I'm still targeting the wrong file path
[17:03:24] <robertmaxrees> heh
[17:04:31] <printForever> IT FREAKING WORKED!!!
[17:17:28] <czabel> I'm having two issues, both using the code found on the Sortable Portlets page: I don't get any +/- icon to toggle the content, and I can't figure out how to organize it in rows rather than columns.
[17:17:50] <robertmaxrees> can you share a fiddle of the problem?
[17:18:50] <czabel> It's identical to the code on the jqueryui demo page, which is why I'm so confused
[17:19:36] <czabel> Well I'm using a newer version of jQuery than the demo, but that's it
[17:22:06] <robertmaxrees> that might cause an issue.
[17:22:09] <robertmaxrees> how much newer?
[17:22:14] <robertmaxrees> and can you link to the docs?
[17:22:22] <robertmaxrees> *the ones you're looking at.
[17:22:34] <czabel> https://jqueryui.com/sortable/#portlets
[17:22:55] <robertmaxrees> and you're including the CSS files too, yeah?
[17:23:00] <czabel> Yes
[17:23:13] <robertmaxrees> what version of JQ are you using?
[17:23:45] <czabel> 3.1.1
[17:24:05] <robertmaxrees> and jqui?
[17:24:12] <robertmaxrees> 1.12?
[17:24:20] <czabel> 1.12.1
[17:25:25] <czabel> I guess I can downgrade jQuery - is doing so safe though?
[17:25:32] <robertmaxrees> "safe" as in..?
[17:25:51] <czabel> Are there vulnerabilities/bugs/issues that have been fixed in newer versions
[17:26:11] <czabel> Or are newer versions mainly new functionality
[17:27:45] <robertmaxrees> 1 sec,
[17:30:36] <czabel> Okay, I flipped back to jQuery 1.12.4 to match the demo, and I'm still not seeing the +/- toggle icon that the demo has
[17:33:23] <robertmaxrees> 1 sec.
[17:33:31] <czabel> Sure thing, thanks
[17:47:14] <czabel> Okay robert, I re-copied everything from the demo page, and the +/- is there now, but in a different spot somehow. I'm giving up on that for now. Is there anywhere I can change the sorting direction? I don't want vertical stacking of these objects, I want horizontal, if possible.
[17:52:34] <Buoy172> Howdy
[17:54:06] <robertmaxrees> czabel so you basically have https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/dc9soth4/ right now, yeah?
[17:55:15] <czabel> Basically, yes, the text is just different in each portlet
[17:56:08] <robertmaxrees> so when you talk about "stacking" do you mean you want stuff to "shift" horizontally instead of vertically when you move things around?
[17:57:03] <czabel> Correct. I want to allow the possibility for there to be more portlets on the second row than the first, if the user desires
[18:01:12] <robertmaxrees> aaaah so you basically want a grid.
[18:01:24] <robertmaxrees> with horizontal soorting.
[18:01:26] <robertmaxrees> *sorting.
[18:01:27] <robertmaxrees> hrmm
[18:01:38] <Randomage> I have a problem with the video element, I can unload most stuff, but the download button is still there and working. You can test the issue here: https://codepen.io/anon/pen/BRLORX (just click the play button, and then click unload video)
[18:01:56] <robertmaxrees> czabel https://jqueryui.com/sortable/#display-grid check this out and see if it has any clues.
[18:02:00] <Randomage> Can anyone suggest a way to remove the download button as well? (tested on Chrome)
[18:04:32] <robertmaxrees> Randomage http://stackoverflow.com/questions/39602852/disable-download-button-for-google-chrome/40975859#40975859
[18:04:53] <robertmaxrees> not elegant but relevan
[18:04:56] <Randomage> I don't want to disable the download in general.
[18:05:09] <robertmaxrees> you can assign that to a class and add/remove that class.
[18:05:12] <Randomage> I want to know how to properly "reset" a video player so it goes back to having no video.
[18:05:44] <Randomage> Updated the pen.
[18:06:39] <czabel> robertmaxrees: I want that structure, but I don't want that functionality; e.g. moving "4" causes "5" to move up to the top row, which I don't want.
[18:07:22] <czabel> This is why I was thinking using the code in the Portlets demo and changing the "column" divs to be "rows," I just can't get the sorting aspect to cooperate with that direction
[18:07:43] <czabel> Oh shoot maybe I just need to put lists in those divs
[18:07:44] <robertmaxrees> czabel are you also floating the portlets to left?
[18:08:49] <czabel> I am not, only the .column divs have "float: left;"
[18:09:07] <robertmaxrees> czabel the individual portlets would need float left as well.
[18:09:16] <robertmaxrees> and the colums would actually need to be wider.
[18:09:24] <robertmaxrees> instead of tall an narrow, wide and squat.
[18:11:49] <robertmaxrees> czabel this isn't perfect but should give you an idea https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/dc9soth4/1/
[18:11:59] <robertmaxrees> plenty buggy but gets to the heard of the css changes.
[18:13:46] <Buoy172> Randomage: why don't you just hide the <video> element?
[18:14:01] <Randomage> Because I need to still display the poster.
[18:14:10] <Randomage> as in the Poster attribute.
[18:16:55] <Buoy172> Randomage, would this work: https://codepen.io/anon/pen/gWwdeN ?
[18:17:14] <Randomage> Nope.
[18:17:39] <Randomage> Really, I just need to unload the video, I got it 99% working, the download button is the only thing still in the way.
[18:17:55] <Randomage> I'm not sure tho, am I making a silly request?
[18:18:09] <Randomage> it's an option, I truly have no idea.
[18:18:13] <robertmaxrees> heh, we gave you a way to hide it.
[18:18:25] <robertmaxrees> you can use a class to conditionally hide/show it.
[18:18:29] <Randomage> I don't want to hide it, I want to unload it.
[18:18:38] <Randomage> as in, go back to a previous state
[18:19:06] <robertmaxrees> you said all of it is fine except for the download icon, right?
[18:19:11] <robertmaxrees> that's the last bit to figure out?
[18:19:29] <robertmaxrees> because otherwise, you could try to steamroll over it with another <video> tag.
[18:19:40] <Buoy172> like my example
[18:19:45] <Randomage> Maybe, maybe not, the fact that it's there and still remembers the path of the sources I explicitly unset, might be a symptom of something else.
[18:20:12] <robertmaxrees> Randomage right, it's that the browser still has that info for whatever reason.
[18:20:19] <robertmaxrees> MDN doesn't reveal any api to do what you want.
[18:21:08] <robertmaxrees> sooo i'm guessing what you're asking for isn't technically possible, at least the way you're doing it.
[18:21:15] <Buoy172> I think with your html, the video element loads the videos in RAM and there's no way to unload them. At least I don't know of a way.
[18:21:27] <robertmaxrees> you can steamroll it, or you can conditionally hide that download icon.
[18:24:12] <czabel> Alright robertmaxrees, I don't know how you did that - but thank you very very much
[18:24:40] <robertmaxrees> czabel i changed the classes to "row" instead of "column"
[18:24:53] <robertmaxrees> then you can see the css changes i made to the .row and portlet classe3s.
[18:25:05] <robertmaxrees> and i updated the .column reference to .row in the js.
[18:25:14] <robertmaxrees> that point you int he right direction though?
[18:25:39] <czabel> Sure, but I changed the css in your original fiddle, and it doesn't work the same way
[18:25:51] <czabel> Yes, it definitely does
[18:26:11] <robertmaxrees> copy/pasting the css over isn't enough heh
[18:26:32] <czabel> I just changed the values within the .column class, not the name
[18:26:39] <czabel> Which should be just the same right?
[18:26:43] <robertmaxrees> also gotta change the portlets, too.
[18:26:55] <czabel> I did
[18:26:59] <robertmaxrees> link?
[18:27:09] <robertmaxrees> (hit updated and share the new page linl)
[18:27:16] <robertmaxrees> *update *link
[18:27:53] <czabel> https://jsfiddle.net/dc9soth4/3/
[18:28:32] <robertmaxrees> the width on portlet needs to be wider.
[18:29:12] <czabel> Why is that? It works with 120px on my server
[18:29:19] <robertmaxrees> just for the fiddle.
[18:29:41] <czabel> Oh hah, ok
[18:29:43] <robertmaxrees> you want three colums wide.  each row is 600px.
[18:29:44] <robertmaxrees> etc.
[18:29:54] <Randomage> Time for some light reading: https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/blink/+/master/Source/core/html/HTMLVideoElement.cpp
[18:30:20] <robertmaxrees> Randomage https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLVideoElement
[18:30:59] <czabel> Anyway thank you robertmaxrees, now I just need to fix the placeholder to show up correctly and I'm set to continue
[18:31:05] <czabel> I appreciate the help
[18:31:05] <robertmaxrees> Rad.
[18:31:28] <Randomage> godspeed czabel.
[18:57:58] <Me1of1> how would I target an html element that has area-hidden="false" attribute with jQuery?
[18:58:15] <robertmaxrees> with an attribute selector.
[18:58:19] <robertmaxrees> or a .filter()
[18:59:58] <Me1of1> robertmaxrees, nice! I'll look into both methods right now, thanks for the heads up :)
