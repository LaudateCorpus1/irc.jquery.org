[07:45:44] <skm> hi guys
[08:10:45] <devi8> Good morning
[09:32:40] <devi8> Does anyone know how to allow items to be draggable from one collapsible list (accordian) to an area without allowing therm to be sorted amongst themselves in jquery UI?
[11:27:26] <boor> Hello, I am trying to get the data-id value of this html
[11:27:28] <boor> https://jsfiddle.net/extjntoz/1/
[11:28:03] <boor> If only one element has data-id, how to retrieve that particular one only?
[11:32:08] <Garfield-fr> .data('id')
[11:33:43] <boor> ?

[11:47:32] <boor> Garfield-fr Thanks !
[11:47:40] <boor> Didn't think of that way
[11:47:58] <Garfield-fr> (y)
[14:54:59] <PrimmSlim> Hey guys
[14:55:15] <PrimmSlim> I'd appreciate some help from a jQuery wiz, something I've been stuck on for 10 hours now
[14:55:40] <PrimmSlim> I've made a custom html5 video that uses jquery to handle some custom stuff like play/mute/repeat etc
[14:55:58] <PrimmSlim> Now I also have a playlist - once a playlist video is clicked, the video from that list loads in the main player
[14:56:10] <PrimmSlim> But values like mute etc aren't passing through
[16:16:14] <jak2000> how to diplay this character: ° ?  in y html i see: Â°
[16:32:08] <pavonia> Wrong encoding probably
[16:40:30] <jak2000> i try with:
[16:41:17] <jak2000> &deg;
[16:41:21] <jak2000> not wrk :(
[16:53:59] <pavonia> What does that mean? What is the displayed result for &deg;?
[17:00:22] <Neo4> pavonia: ;)
[17:20:21] <jak2000> pavonia are you there
[17:20:24] <jak2000> escuse me...
[17:21:10] <jak2000> Temp Â°C	 and
[17:21:53] <pavonia> That is with &deg;?
[17:22:01] <jak2000> and
[17:22:02] <jak2000> Temp &deg;C	
[17:22:08] <jak2000> wait
[17:22:10] <jak2000> see:
[17:23:06] <jak2000> https://paste.debian.net/1006194/
[17:23:32] <jak2000> see line 35 and 36
[17:24:33] <pavonia> What is createTh?
[17:24:48] <jak2000> is this script of datatables:
[17:25:10] <jak2000> https://paste.debian.net/1006195/
[17:25:36] <jak2000> is possible fix?
[17:26:46] <pavonia> You use .text() to set the contents which already escapes the special characters. You probably want .html()
[17:27:35] <jak2000> ooo yes
[17:27:36] <jak2000> yes
[17:27:42] <jak2000> done
[17:27:45] <jak2000> other thing
[17:28:04] <pavonia> createTh(hileraHead, "Temp °C"); should work though if your file is properly encoded
[17:29:01] <jak2000> https://paste.debian.net/1006194/   <--- see line:87 and 88 ?
[17:29:20] <jak2000> xPesoNeto  is a global variable....
[17:31:04] <jak2000> right?
[17:31:34] <jak2000> my problem is: line 118 always display 0.00
[17:32:00] <jak2000> i think execute first line 118 (before finish of the (for...) how to fix?
[17:34:29] <pavonia> It should be global, yes. If you want to enforece order of execution you can set a handler inside of the handler that evalues after the global variable has been set
[17:35:57] <pavonia> But it's tricky because you are calling the handlers in a loop
[17:51:47] <jak2000> pavonia how to fix?
[17:54:01] <pavonia> You should separate data and DOM updates. The timeout handler seems to be only needed for DOM updates, so put only that stuff into the handler. Then your global variable have the correct value after the loop
[17:54:25] <pavonia> *should have
[17:57:57] <jak2000> mm ok
[21:30:30] <jak2000> pavonia?
