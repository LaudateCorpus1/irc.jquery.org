[00:33:58] <VectorX> i got a google maps api question, i have an event listener on the map which works fine to get the lat lng, but if there is location marker on the map and i click that like say a building it doesnt fire, how can i get it to work in those instances
[00:34:38] <VectorX> these are the markers that come on the map and not custom markers
[00:50:39] <zitter> hi, I would like to modify $.ajax.url with beforeSend() method. In this code: http://pastebin.com/fuWS5Pah in beforeSend() method I do an async IndexedDB call, so I cannot modify $.ajax.url (or add query string to 'data'). I've tried also to add a setTimeout (desperate solution!) but it doesn't work either. Any hint on how to modify url/data using inedexsdb?
[00:53:26] <FilipNortic> zitter: If you use jsfiddle or jsbin to paste you make it alot esier for people to help you...
[00:53:45] <qwerty121> Hey all, I am fetching some images via ajax. I can find out if ajaxload is complete by $.ajaxComplete(...) but how can I find out if the images are loaded?
[00:54:28] <qwerty121> i.e. I want to know that the images fetched via ajax are loaded by the browser.
[00:55:53] <FilipNortic> qwerty121:  Well you could check the element where you want to display them or do want to know if you have them in the response before trying to load them?
[00:57:41] <qwerty121> FilipNortic: I am not sure if I can follow you. I have a complex isotope layout where the grid elements load images via ajax. Once the images are loaded, I relayout the grid.
[00:58:16] <qwerty121> Once the document is loaded, several ajax calls are made, which fetches the images.
[00:58:40] <qwerty121> Currently I am using $(document).ajaxComplete(...do relayout...)
[00:59:07] <qwerty121> but it seems that even after ajaxComplete is done, the images take time to properly load.
[00:59:21] <qwerty121> This means the relayout happens before images are loaded.
[01:00:36] <qwerty121> So, ideally, I need this to happen: Check if ajaxComplete is done and also check if images are loaded -> relayout
[01:03:55] <FilipNortic> qwerty121: you usally use success insted of ajaxComplete since that only triggers if your ajax request is successful and it is bound to the request and not to the document
[01:05:15] <qwerty121> FilipNortic: I see your point but as soon as document is loaded, several ajax requests are sent. If I follow your advice, I have to relayout after every ajax request.
[01:05:46] <qwerty121> $.ajaxComplete() runs after all ajax requests are processed.
[01:05:53] <qwerty121> ...if I am not wrong.
[01:10:57] <FilipNortic> qwerty121:  well since you need a check anyway you can just wait to trigger the relayout function
[01:11:40] <FilipNortic> ??has
[01:11:52] <FilipNortic> !api has
[01:11:52] <b-ot> FilipNortic: .has(): Reduce the set of matched elements to those that have a descendant that matches the selector or DOM element. http://api.jquery.com/has/
[01:13:33] <qwerty121> FilipNortic: thanks!
[01:15:27] <qwerty121> Just made some experiments with $("img").load. It looks like $(document).ajaxComplete(function(){ $("img").load(function(){});}); does the trick.
[01:15:40] <qwerty121> FilipNortic: thanks for the ideas!
[01:16:09] <FilipNortic> !api ajaxComplete
[01:16:09] <b-ot> FilipNortic: .ajaxComplete(): Register a handler to be called when Ajax requests complete. This is an <a href="http://docs.jquery.com/Ajax_Events">Ajax Event</a>. http://api.jquery.com/ajaxComplete/
[01:16:51] <qwerty121> Just as I guessed. It waits till all ajax requests are complete.
[01:17:36] <FilipNortic> qwerty121: no unless you tell it too do so it should fire after each completion
[01:18:33] <FilipNortic> well that depends on how you bundle your request i suppose
[01:31:51] <utterly_confused> hello all
[01:32:08] <utterly_confused> I am using the select2 jquery plugin
[01:32:28] <utterly_confused> i want to handle the keydown event when the tab button is clicked
[01:32:57] <utterly_confused> so I manage to do so, however, select2 first deletes whatever's in the input and ONLY then does it enter the keydown event
[01:33:07] <utterly_confused> this is driving my nuts so please any help would be greatly appreciated
[02:01:21] <stoned> :)
[03:26:58] <dangerousdave> morning, could someone help me understan this code please? https://gist.github.com/anonymous/cc2408feca923738d518
[03:28:18] <Lunastyx> hello
[03:31:23] <Lunastyx> I have several elements set at class A in a div with id 1, I want to put then in div with id 2. I am doing block = document.getElementById('1'); hidden = documet.getElementById('2');, then var list = block.getElementsByClassName('A'); and last : a for from k = 0, k< list.length, k++ { $(list[k]).appendTo(hidden); }
[03:36:03] <Lunastyx> My issue is that a few elements of class A stay in 1
[04:04:15] <z3l> Lets say I have : "<tr><td>Id</td><td>sth else</td><td><a href="">abc</a></td></tr>" I have retrieved abc with jquery, is that possible from this to retrieve the content of first <td></td> , in that case
[04:04:18] <dangerousdave> what does this function i wrote do please?  https://gist.github.com/anonymous/cc2408feca923738d518

[05:15:06] <FilipNortic> !api getScript()
[05:15:08] <b-ot> FilipNortic: No matches.
[05:16:21] <FilipNortic> well getScript is an ajax Call with script as datatype

[05:36:15] <dawie> Is there anyway have my urls have %20 in them instead of %2B that usually happens using .serialize?
[05:39:20] <Amirh> hi
[05:39:37] <pcfreak30> dawie: .replace('%2B','%20')
[05:39:50] <pcfreak30> make a wapper method
[05:39:59] <Amirh> I have used some custom attributes like id, type ,.. on an element, I can read them trough .attr('') in chrome, but doesn;t work in firefox
[05:40:03] <Amirh> what's the solution?
[05:40:05] <Amirh> please
[05:41:27] <dawie> pcfreak30: new to jquery, what is a wrapper method?
[05:42:02] <Amirh> is there any solution to make $(some element).attr(someattr) work in firefox?
[05:42:55] <Amirh> dawie: sorry for interrupt, can you help me?
[05:43:39] <pcfreak30> dawie: Its not a jq thing, its general programming
[05:44:47] <pcfreak30> dawie: If you need to modify the output/return of a call multiple times, you make a method/function that does it to simply the code base, so if you need to mofify it later, you only have 1 function/method to modify.
[05:45:51] <dawie> pcfreak30: Thanks, ill read up on it. I'm new to programming in general as you can probably tell :)
[05:46:34] <pcfreak30> dawie: I remember when I was that way. Now coding is like breathing. I dont try, I just do.
[05:46:49] <Amirh> hi
[05:47:13] <Amirh> is there any solution to make $(some element).attr(someattr) work in firefox?
[05:48:22] <pcfreak30> Amirh: it doesnt work? Try prop not attr
[05:49:08] <decx> your problem is elsewhere
[05:50:45] <FilipNortic> pcfreak30: did you solve your responseCode issue?
[05:51:01] <pcfreak30> FilipNortic: Not exactly
[05:51:35] <pcfreak30> I tried making code to catch 301 and 302 and do a recursive ajax call, with asnc false, but the Location header is blank.
[05:52:02] <pcfreak30> Somehow I am getting hit with coudflare security? I am not sure
[05:52:16] <FilipNortic> otherwise the responsvalue should have a status property right?
[05:52:24] <pcfreak30> As Its throwing a 302, and a log of the headers shows cloudflare RAY data
[05:53:14] <pcfreak30> FilipNortic: http://pastie.org/private/w72kyj3pu7a5vzcy1o8zlg
[05:53:31] <pcfreak30> Thats from console.log(jqXHR.getAllResponseHeaders()); on the error handler
[05:54:33] <pcfreak30> Any idea what is going on there?
[05:55:25] <FilipNortic> no.., is jqXHR.status == undefined?
[05:55:35] <pcfreak30> no
[05:55:38] <pcfreak30> its 302
[05:55:48] <pcfreak30> with a blank location header
[05:58:16] <pcfreak30> FilipNortic: I simulated an ajax via wget --header="X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest" -O -
[05:58:30] <pcfreak30> Worked fine.
[06:04:27] <FilipNortic> pcfreak30: if wget worked my spontanius guess would be some cache error but it shouln't be an issue since no-cache was set
[06:09:44] <pcfreak30> FilipNortic: I think I am going to try and use browserify and use http module.
[06:10:43] <DelphiWorld> hello
[06:10:50] <madalin> 'lo DelphiWorld
[06:10:55] <DelphiWorld> i want to use a jquery plugin but it's not minified. what do i need to minify it?
[06:11:04] <DelphiWorld> madalin: :)
[06:11:48] <pcfreak30> DelphiWorld: http://closure-compiler.appspot.com/
[06:12:32] <DelphiWorld> pcfreak30: is that a online task or a app to install? i wish to do that on linux (shell)
[06:13:09] <pcfreak30> DelphiWorld: Its a web service to the closure compiler which is a jar app
[06:13:19] <DelphiWorld> mmmmmmmmmmmmmm
[06:13:27] <DelphiWorld> pcfreak30: do you know grunt?
[06:13:31] <pcfreak30> Yes
[06:13:39] <DelphiWorld> is that a minifier?
[06:13:57] <pcfreak30> no
[06:14:03] <pcfreak30> its a task running
[06:14:05] <pcfreak30> runner
[06:14:28] <DelphiWorld> pcfreak30: this plugin provide gruntfile.js and package.json so i thought maybe it using some software on linux... sham
[06:14:29] <pcfreak30> it can minify via a task, but it is not a minifier itself
[06:16:15] <DelphiWorld> pcfreak30: ok, i'lle try it on debian if i find it;)
[06:29:10] <frank_o> I'm having this issue where jquery-embedly makes iScroll inaccessible under Chrome's mobile emulation: http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/5YDjS/ -- does anyone know of a way I can reproduce this issue _without_ iScroll?
[06:30:56] <DelphiWorld> pcfreak30: ok i'm setting grunt on node.js now, i'lle report
[06:33:05] <FilipNortic> frank_o: So you have an error/issue with a plugin and you want the same error/issue without the plugin?
[06:36:51] <frank_o> FilipNortic: Trying to see if maybe something is jacked up with the touch events
[06:40:50] <Sal> hi
[06:41:51] <Sal> for a function to run on document ready, can i replace function() with the name of my function? $(function(){
[06:41:52] <Sal>  ...
[06:41:52] <Sal> }) in this $(myFunc(){
[06:41:52] <Sal>  ...
[06:41:52] <Sal> });
[06:41:55] <Sal> will that work?
[06:42:34] <DelphiWorld> guys anyone using grunt?
[06:44:25] <BillCriswell> DelphiWorld: I do on occasion for some work projects, prefer gulp for personal stuff.
[06:44:46] <DelphiWorld> BillCriswell: lol hey dude
[06:44:56] <BillCriswell> Ayyyyy
[06:44:57] <DelphiWorld> BillCriswell: i have a plugin that use grunt but no clue how to compile it
[06:45:24] <BillCriswell> Does the plugin have a github repp with a readme?
[06:45:39] <DelphiWorld> yes but no way they dont tel you how;)
[06:45:58] <BillCriswell> Where's the repo?
[06:46:10] <DelphiWorld> BillCriswell: hold off:P
[06:46:18] <BillCriswell> Okie doke.
[06:46:52] <pcfreak30> DelphiWorld: http://gruntjs.com/getting-started
[06:47:11] <DelphiWorld> pcfreak30: dont wory i'm seating there:P
[06:47:13] <DelphiWorld> BillCriswell: https://github.com/filamentgroup/responsive-carousel
[06:47:53] <pcfreak30> DelphiWorld: BTW if you JUST want to minify, you can just install a minifier package and not use grunt as it would be overkill.
[06:48:03] <mickburkesnr> has anyone here used Underscore.js? I've used it to group some data by month, but now I can't access the object it creates?
[06:48:25] <DelphiWorld> pcfreak30: yes, but love to have some adventures;)
[06:48:43] <DelphiWorld> pcfreak30: also if this plugin ofer minification tasks using grunt... it would be good to use it
[06:51:32] <DelphiWorld> pcfreak30: gruntification look simple... lol
[06:51:44] <Eppiox> Howdy, anyone know how to select a div via a specific titile? My div (which I can select just fine via class name) has a title of "hello select me" alas, I think I am getting the syntax wrong.
[06:52:30] <pcfreak30> Eppiox: div[title='']
[06:52:36] <pcfreak30> May need to escape chars
[06:52:40] <DelphiWorld> pcfreak30: lol, minification done
[06:53:27] <BillCriswell> DelphiWorld: Pretty sure just running npm install then grunt from the root of that repo will do what you need?
[06:53:38] <DelphiWorld> BillCriswell: that was i did
[06:53:43] <nisseni> https://gist.github.com/ishareab/6b6009cec5849d48a429 - I have these two functions that are putting out a random letter, if the user clicks the correct one he gets a point. How can I prevent the next letter from being the same as the previous one?
[06:54:28] <BillCriswell> DelphiWorld: So it works?
[06:54:40] <DelphiWorld> bimyup yup, awesoooome
[06:54:50] <DelphiWorld> so now i'lle need just to get the .min.js?
[06:55:18] <BillCriswell> Yeah, looks like it should create a /dist dir
[06:55:33] <DelphiWorld> the dist is there but lot of .js
[06:57:00] <DelphiWorld> stupid me, grunt is easy and was looking for minified plugins for years!
[06:58:03] <BillCriswell> Yeah. It's cool. I still prefer gulp but different strokes for different folks!
[06:59:23] <BillCriswell> Hm, the minified grunt outputs <banner:meta.banner>.
[06:59:43] <DelphiWorld> BillCriswell: lol NPM=== No Peace Mate! :P
[07:00:17] <BillCriswell> https://github.com/filamentgroup/responsive-carousel/issues/83 looks like I wasn't the only one with the issue haha.
[07:00:34] <DelphiWorld> lol
[07:00:44] <BillCriswell> DelphiWorld: Sure this thing has been maintained properly?
[07:00:52] <BillCriswell> That issue was opened some time ago.
[07:00:57] <DelphiWorld> BillCriswell: not sure, but  just trying it
[07:01:04] <DelphiWorld> BillCriswell: not for production
[07:01:15] <BillCriswell> Ah ok.
[07:01:35] <DelphiWorld> BillCriswell: if you know a good slide plugin let me know
[07:02:01] <BillCriswell> It really depends on the requirements.
[07:02:49] <DelphiWorld> BillCriswell: just want pictures to be one after another
[07:03:12] <BillCriswell> Any special transitions? Touch support? Keyboard support?
[07:03:26] <DelphiWorld> BillCriswell: touch, no need for keyboard;)
[07:04:03] <cmosguy> hi all, is there a jquery function that I can use to look at all the objects keys and find out of the value is null i then want to delete that key from the object?
[07:05:28] <Eppiox> pcfreak30 ^ thanks !
[07:05:48] <Eppiox> the escape chars worked a charm
[07:05:49] <BillCriswell> DelphiWorld: I'd probaby end up just googling it haha. bxSlider came up and looks promising.
[07:06:08] <pcfreak30> Eppiox: NP
[07:06:10] <DelphiWorld> BillCriswell: lol let me check it out
[07:29:13] <BillCriswell> Man, googling sass functions never seem to go well.
[07:32:41] <cmosguy> hi all, is there a jquery function that I can use to look at all the objects keys and find out of the value is null i then want to delete that key from the object?
[07:33:06] <Jattenalle> cmosguy, no, but you want Object.keys(someObjectHere)
[07:33:16] <Jattenalle> which will return all keys for that object
[07:33:29] <Jattenalle> then you can just go through them using .each() or whathaveyou
[07:33:44] <cmosguy> Jattenalle, you can do foo.keys.each()?
[07:34:05] <Jattenalle> cmosguy, $(Object.keys(myObject)).each()
[07:34:36] <Jattenalle> so if your object is, say salaryList, you'd do: $(Object.keys(salaryList)).each()
[07:35:03] <cmosguy> Jattenalle, thanks so much!
[07:35:24] <Jattenalle> np, good luck
[08:12:17] <maahacka> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2429045/iframe-src-change-event-detection
[08:12:29] <maahacka> is this still supposed to work in modern browsers? I can't get it running
[08:13:21] <duch_kazatel> you can watch the load event, though that's when the page has finished loading, not necessarily when the src has changed.
[08:13:42] <maahacka> how do I do this?
[08:13:50] <duch_kazatel> $('iframe').on('load', function() { /* your code here */ });
[08:13:59] <maahacka> ok, sec
[08:14:09] <maahacka> I tried with $('#iframe').load()
[08:14:37] <duch_kazatel> that basically maps to what I have above.
[08:15:59] <maahacka> it doesn't call that function
[08:16:06] <duch_kazatel> do you have any console errors?
[08:16:12] <maahacka> no, nothing
[08:16:25] <maahacka> I am actually executing this in the console itself too
[08:16:35] <duch_kazatel> then you have something else going on.
[08:16:38] <duch_kazatel> mind sharing your code?
[08:16:43] <maahacka> the $('#_iframe').on('load', function(){..
[08:17:06] <maahacka> the page is online too
[08:17:14] <maahacka> https://www.jobvector.de/jobvector-career-day.html
[08:17:34] <duch_kazatel> which iframe is it?
[08:17:44] <maahacka> you have to click on "anmelden", under Berlin, 25 September
[08:17:54] <maahacka> the iframe is then loaded dynamically
[08:18:23] <maahacka> and then in my developer console I try to attach the event listener (because the CMS is too clumsy, I want to get it running like this first)
[08:18:36] <duch_kazatel> i don't see the iframe.  how do I access it?
[08:18:45] <maahacka> the iframe ID is #_amiandoIFrame2352152JuCBzMhx
[08:19:07] <maahacka> under Berlin, 25. September 2014
[08:19:18] <maahacka> on the right there is an orange button "ANMELDUNG"
[08:19:25] <maahacka> and an arrow pointing to it
[08:19:26] <duch_kazatel> o'
[08:19:31] <maahacka> you have to click that :)
[08:19:56] <duch_kazatel> and then weiter?
[08:20:04] <duch_kazatel> i  see it now.
[08:20:27] <maahacka> yes, and "weiter" for example changes the src of the iframe
[08:20:44] <maahacka> the problem is that after "weiter" you get a very long form
[08:21:03] <maahacka> and when you submit it - the next page is much shorter and your screen doesn't see it anymore, because it is scrolled too deep in the page
[08:21:23] <maahacka> what I want to do is scroll back to the top of the iframe after you submit the form
[08:21:34] <duch_kazatel> the url of the page doesn't change btw.
[08:22:20] <duch_kazatel> are you in control of the iframe source?
[08:22:57] <maahacka> oh .. it really doesn't ;(
[08:22:59] <maahacka> no
[08:23:07] <maahacka> it's a third-party registration tool
[08:23:34] <maahacka> I got fooled by Google Analytics that it changes, because it registers every click under different URL
[08:23:35] <maahacka> :D
[08:23:58] <decx> is fiddle slow today?
[08:25:25] <duch_kazatel> maahacka at least I'm not seeing it change while watching it in my inspector.  you can't register an event listener on the contents either, so you'll kind of SOL.
[08:26:03] <maahacka> SOL?
[08:26:11] <duch_kazatel> shit outta luck
[08:26:36] <maahacka> yes I guess I can't do anything about it
[08:27:09] <maahacka> I think the URL does change, but my browser is not allowed to see it, because of the cross domain policy
[08:27:17] <duch_kazatel> it doesn't actually.
[08:27:26] <maahacka> would I see it if it did?
[08:27:31] <duch_kazatel> yes.
[08:27:51] <maahacka> hm .. maybe they set the URL in GA artificially
[08:28:53] <maahacka> thank you anyway
[08:29:13] <duch_kazatel> decx I haven't looked today yet.
[08:32:16] <bjensen8_> How do I check if a data attribute is present on a element?
[08:33:52] <duch_kazatel> if ($('element').data('key') === undefined);
[08:35:45] <duch_kazatel> bjensen8_ like this http://jsfiddle.net/y8Avs/1/
[08:41:18] <duch_kazatel> quiet in here today
[08:43:50] <drej> duch_kazatel shhh
[08:44:28] <jimi_> Can someone recommend a method for recording voice data from an android/ios device and posting it as a file?
[08:45:49] <MikeD_> jimi_:  isn't that called voicemail?
[08:46:00] <jimi_> MikeD_, ha :)
[08:47:09] <MikeD_> are you expecting to download an app that has access to the microphone?
[08:48:41] <jimi_> MikeD_, being able to access the camera and microphone
[08:48:58] <decx> getUserMedia()
[08:49:00] <drej> jimi_ you'll probably need phonegap or something
[08:49:17] <jimi_> drej, I thought <input type="file" accept="audio/*;capture=microphone"> would work?
[08:49:41] <drej> sorry i misread, i thought you were trying to save to local filesystem of the device
[08:50:39] <scri66le> anyone know about events for checkboxes -> http://pastebin.com/s18yS5gP
[08:50:52] <jimi_> drej, sorry... no i want to accept video/audio
[08:51:07] <duch_kazatel> scri66le you want the "change" event instead.
[08:51:23] <duch_kazatel> scri66le also, don't to an attribute contains selector for IDs.  use a class.
[08:51:26] <drej> scri66le that'll only work if the element is checked on document.ready
[08:51:40] <ngharo> jimi_: getUserMedia() as decx said. Note that iOS safari doesn't support it (you'll need to use an app)
[08:52:05] <duch_kazatel> scri66le also, .is() can only be run on jquery objects - you need $(this).is(':checked')
[08:53:30] <dmsuperm1n> duch_kazatel: why class selector over id contains?
[08:53:37] <dmsuperm1n> just performance?
[08:53:51] <duch_kazatel> because class selectors are made for selecting groups of things.
[08:53:59] <duch_kazatel> semantics, performance, etc.
[08:54:19] <decx> anytime you do a contains or an attribute selector it will go through every single element to find it
[08:54:28] <dmsuperman> fair enough I suppose. I treat jQuery more like glue than an application framework
[08:54:36] <dmsuperman> jquery hates me :)
[08:54:42] <duch_kazatel> has nothing to do with how you treat it.
[08:54:43] <thebope> I treat it like grapes
[08:54:59] <dmsuperman> sure it does. If I have an application that doesn't have classes already and it does have IDs
[08:55:03] <dmsuperman> then I'll use an ID selector
[08:55:10] <dmsuperman> unless it's easy to add the classes
[08:55:14] <dmsuperman> which isn't always teh case
[08:55:39] <duch_kazatel> but you're using an id contains, which generally means you really just want a class.
[08:56:00] <dmsuperman> right, which is why I said "unless it's easy to add the classes which isn't always the case"
[08:56:15] <dmsuperman> if I can use a class I will but if I can't I won't... I was just curiosu about the reasoning some people use for one over the other
[08:56:27] <duch_kazatel> i'm having a hard time thinking of a case where it'd be hard to add a class.
[08:56:37] <dmsuperman> have you never worked on the frontend of an application only?
[08:56:45] <dmsuperman> a crappy CMS system?
[08:56:50] <dmsuperman> the real world is full of cases like that
[08:56:54] <duch_kazatel> oh jesus
[08:57:05] <dmsuperman> not everything is a fresh project you get to make all the decisions on
[08:57:09] <duch_kazatel> nope.
[08:57:15] <duch_kazatel> i don't work on a fresh project.
[08:57:29] <duch_kazatel> i work on an antiquated codebase written in ColdFusion.
[08:57:41] <dmsuperman> but still, you have athe authority to change it no?
[08:57:43] <dmsuperman> that's not always the case
[08:57:45] <duch_kazatel> not always.
[08:58:07] <dmsuperman> well then you understand what I'm talking about where you can't always add a class
[08:58:10] <dmsuperman> or whatever makes the most sense
[08:58:31] <duch_kazatel> generally, yes.  but any place that wouldn't trust your judgement to add a class and instead makes you do things like use an attribute contains selector is questionable imo.
[08:58:40] <duch_kazatel> but meh.  apparently i don't live in the real world.
[08:58:45] <scri66le> duch_kazatel, like this-> http://pastebin.com/wsekuNdx
[08:59:11] <dmsuperman> depends on the place. I agree, but as a contractor you don't always get full access. Also I'm thinking of things like third party plugins that are used throughout the system
[08:59:31] <dmsuperman> the third party plugin spits out the HTML, we can't change the third party plugin, and for me to go through and replace the plugin in all the thousands of places it's being used in the project
[08:59:37] <duch_kazatel> that's the beautify of classes, you can add more ;)
[08:59:43] <duch_kazatel> *beauty
[08:59:46] <duch_kazatel> and it's all situational.
[08:59:49] <dmsuperman> THIRD party plugin
[08:59:56] <dmsuperman> as in I can't modify the code to add more classes
[08:59:59] <dmsuperman> since I don't own it
[09:00:08] <duch_kazatel> correct, we use third party plugins here.  you mean in the markup those plugins generate?
[09:00:08] <dmsuperman> and they weren't smart enough to add options for more classes
[09:00:14] <dmsuperman> yup exactly
[09:00:27] <duch_kazatel> sounds like you've got a fringe case and clients that need education, but that's not my place to say ;)
[09:00:33] <dmsuperman> sometimes it's more cost effective to just use jquery glue than rewrite the plugin
[09:00:59] <duch_kazatel> not saying you should ever rewrite anything, but meh.
[09:01:14] <dmsuperman> rewrite the plugin or replace the plugin withs omething else that lets me add classes, etc
[09:02:20] <duch_kazatel> scri66le basically -> http://jsfiddle.net/77GcD/1/
[09:02:36] <duch_kazatel> like i said, use a class if you can.  otherwise, you've got the basic idea.
[09:05:38] <bjensen8_> when I set an attribute using .data() I verify that it is set. However when trying to read the data attribute through a callback, then its not set. As I recall data() doesnt write to the DOM doees it? If not how would I force a refresh on the object i get in the callback?
[09:06:07] <duch_kazatel> bjensen8_ huh?
[09:10:00] <duch_kazatel> bjensen8_ .data() write so a special cached location, so you don't need to refresh anything.
[09:10:50] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/BG48k/ <- just use it :)
[09:10:52] <decx> where does it write to anyway
[09:12:02] <duch_kazatel> it's stored within the jQuery closure.
[09:57:38] <FernandoBasso> I have to do $('body').on('click', ...) and do something only if the click was not in a specific element with class 'upd-field'. What is the recommended way of saying "if the click was not in X"?
[09:58:08] <FernandoBasso> When I console.log(this), I always get "body".
[09:58:29] <FernandoBasso> So, if this.className !== 'upd-field' will not work.
[09:58:30] <duch_kazatel> because your click handler is bound to the body.
[09:58:48] <duch_kazatel> check out the event.target
[09:58:59] <FernandoBasso> Ah! Sounds like the correct option. Thanks.
[10:00:03] <FernandoBasso> evt.target.className works fine then.
[10:00:15] <FernandoBasso> I'm just not sure whether this is a reasonable approach.
[10:00:24] <duch_kazatel> why are you doing that?
[10:00:54] <decx> ($(e.target).is('.blah') || $('e.target').closest('.blah').length) is a common check to see if the target is or is inside .blah
[10:01:59] <FernandoBasso> Because I am turning a <td>text into a <td><input value='text'. When the user click anywhere in the doc, I want to turn that into a plain <td> again, with the old value.
[10:02:18] <FernandoBasso> And if the user hits Enter, then I send an ajax request to update the field.
[10:02:39] <FernandoBasso> Anywhere except inside the newly created <input>
[10:03:17] <FernandoBasso> decx: I took a note on your suggestion. Thanks.
[10:03:35] <FernandoBasso> It is something like phpmyadmin does, I guess.
[10:03:54] <phoenixsun> is there a video slider for jquery that allows the user to 'swipe' btn videos and starts the next video playing the moment that it comes into view?
[10:04:37] <FernandoBasso> duch_kazatel, decx: Thank you both for your help and time. It was most appreciated!
[10:04:49] <phoenixsun> and the source of these videos being possibly youtube playlist
[10:13:09] <decx> phoenixsun you can juryrig some slider that doesnt do every little special thing you want with the youtube api
[10:13:32] <dmsuperman> FernandoBasso: that is called "edit in place" fyi and there are existing plugins and solutions to do that
[10:24:46] <BillCriswell> Ugh, found another one of those songs I'll listen to 20 times in a row.
[10:25:30] <decx> it actually works... phoenixsun http://jsfiddle.net/decx/3B364/
[10:27:55] <monk12> hey all, just curious. anyone familiar with Jasmine tests?
[10:28:03] <monk12> curious if I can ask a question bout that here.
[10:30:18] <phoenixsun> decx: Thanks! I will check it out
[10:37:18] <nicoenarg> complete newbie to jquery so i am not sure if my question is even jquery related…so if i have some input fields disabled (using jquery) and i set their value, again using jquery, those values don’t get passed through in POST, but if the fields are readonly then those values get passed through, is this normal behavior or am i screwing up somewhere? OR is this not jquery related at all?
[10:37:56] <FernandoBasso> dmsuperman: All right. Thanks. If things get too complicated I'll look for a plugin.
[10:38:17] <PantsOfChoco> if its readonly on the backend it cant have a post value right?
[10:39:18] <nicoenarg> no it POSTs with readonly, doesn’t with disabled
[10:39:28] <nicoenarg> both readonly and disabled are set using jquery after the page loads
[10:40:08] <nicoenarg> oh values are added to the fields using jquery as well…based on what options are picked and all that crazy stuff i am still getting my head around
[10:44:46] <PantsOfChoco> well if its disabled how can it be added? disabled blocks the field right?
[10:45:45] <FernandoBasso> I set this.oldText = 'foo' inside one function, and later, inside a different function this.oldText is undefined, even though it is the same tag/dom object.
[10:46:34] <FernandoBasso> http://pastebin.com/QEVN76QR
[10:47:22] <FernandoBasso> That works when I use plain javascript. I wonder if because I have $('foobar').on... that the problem arises.
[10:48:05] <decx> it would would if you didnt get a new object
[10:48:10] <FernandoBasso> You see that in the first function this.oldText works in the innerHTML line.
[10:48:11] <phoenixsun> decx: yep its seems to work well
[10:48:20] <decx> regardless dont attach data to your elements like that
[10:48:24] <decx> use data()
[10:48:33] <FernandoBasso> Okay. I was just reading about that. Thanks.
[10:48:41] <decx> or a var that is in a higher scope
[10:48:53] <decx> but probably data() for an oldText
[10:49:37] <nicoenarg> PantsOfChoco well if i add it with jquery, it changes the value of the field when i’m looking at it. The disabled field changes from empty to “ABC” or whatever. i;m not sure we’re on the same page here
[10:50:12] <decx> phoenixsun probably needs some tweaking but i have a client that wants something like that too so i just threw the first best thing i came up with together and it actually worked on first try ;)
[10:51:41] <nicoenarg> nvm, figured it out, the answer to my question is, it isn’t jquery related
[10:51:56] <phoenixsun> decx: its certainly a good first try. I guess the play button is going to show for every video. One cant demand too much I guess of an free OVP :)
[10:52:14] <decx> there's a shitload of options for playerVars
[10:52:21] <decx> one without hud too
[10:52:25] <decx> something somthing controls
[10:53:32] <phoenixsun> I think dig into it and see what do
[10:53:48] <decx> here somewhere https://developers.google.com/youtube/player_parameters?playerVersion=HTML5
[10:54:50] <phoenixsun> it the moment in my simple implementation I am autohiding the controls
[10:55:02] <phoenixsun> an cheap way of reducing the Youtube branding
[10:55:10] <phoenixsun> an = a
[10:55:15] <decx> in playerVars 'controls': 0, 'showinfo': 0
[10:59:38] <andrew9183> where can i find a template for a jquery plugin without a selector
[10:59:53] <decx> what like a function`?
[11:00:06] <andrew9183> yeah
[11:00:10] <decx> function myfunction(){ }
[11:00:13] <decx> 5 dollars please
[11:00:28] <andrew9183> lol
[11:01:03] <decx> maybe elaborate ;)
[11:01:58] <andrew9183> something like this, but cleaner
[11:01:59] <andrew9183> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5764217/creating-custom-jquery-function-without-selector-prerequisite
[11:02:34] <decx> there is no need to attach everything to jquery
[11:02:35] <thebope> When you do something like this -> $("[name*='someName']",this)
[11:02:46] <thebope> Is "this" included in the scope
[11:02:54] <thebope> or is it only the children of "this"
[11:02:56] <andrew9183> yeah, but since the plugin internals are mostly jquery, why not make it jquery :P
[11:03:08] <andrew9183> thebope: tias :)
[11:03:16] <thebope> tias?
[11:03:19] <decx> i'd say it isnt
[11:03:27] <andrew9183> me either
[11:03:29] <thebope> isn't, yea thats what I was thinking
[11:03:30] <andrew9183> it finds it in the context of this
[11:04:44] <decx> well apparently it is
[11:05:21] <thebope> how'd you find out decx ?
[11:05:29] <thebope> I was querying the interwebs and jquery docs for it
[11:05:41] <decx> na it's not
[11:05:44] <thebope> lol
[11:05:53] <thebope> just messing with my heart now
[11:06:49] <thebope> okay I'll just change my logic a bit
[11:06:50] <decx> $('blah',this).add(this)
[11:06:58] <thebope> thanks decx, andrew9183
[11:07:04] <thebope> yea
[11:07:08] <thebope> Ahhh
[11:07:09] <thebope> wow
[11:07:11] <thebope> good call
[11:07:24] <thebope> thanks, I learned something from your learning
[11:07:34] <decx> isnt that why we are here

[11:32:42] <Alina-malina> or even hover?
[11:32:58] <decx> that's just css
[11:34:16] <Alina-malina> decx, hmmm any example of that would be apreciable

[11:40:29] <LocusAsaf> is there a css selector to find a select tag with N number of options inside it?
[11:42:08] <scri66le> i have a foreach making checkboxes and I can't use the change function. http://pastebin.com/0adhTwp1
[11:42:11] <scri66le> any help?
[11:43:22] <FernandoBasso> scri66le: Are you running that js code after the DOM is ready?
[11:43:35] <scri66le> yeah
[11:43:39] <FernandoBasso> Also, do you see any errors on the console?
[11:43:41] <scri66le> $(document).ready(function() {
[11:43:47] <scri66le> no errors
[11:43:49] <scri66le> no output
[11:43:50] <scri66le> nothing
[11:44:07] <FernandoBasso> Change happens only when you leave the field in text fields.
[11:44:24] <FernandoBasso> Perhaps you want keyup?
[11:45:12] <FernandoBasso> Try changing the text and clicking somewhere else in the document.
[11:45:46] <scri66le> FernandoBasso, like changing it to a button?
[11:46:25] <FernandoBasso> No. I mean then in text fields typing text does not cause an 'on change' event.
[11:47:47] <FernandoBasso> Ah! That is checkbox. Sorry...
[11:47:59] <scri66le> FernandoBasso, yeah
[11:48:03] <scri66le> checkbox
[11:48:26] <duch_kazatel> scri66le you want to use event delegation.
[11:48:26] <FernandoBasso> It just works for me here.
[11:48:48] <duch_kazatel> what are you appending those boxes to?
[11:48:53] <scri66le> duch_kazatel, what do you mean?
[11:49:16] <duch_kazatel> $('parent').on('change', 'input[name^="completeAction"], function() { /* your logic here */ });
[11:49:26] <duch_kazatel> where parent is what you're appending your checkboxes to.
[11:50:00] <duch_kazatel> you can only bind listeners to things that exist on pageload.  the syntax I just showed you binds a delegated listener to a parent element that listens for events that bubble up to it.
[11:50:15] <duch_kazatel> check out the docs fo .on().  there's a section about direct vs. delegated events you'll find useful.
[11:52:32] <FernandoBasso> scri66le: Do you add those checkboxes later in your document?
[11:53:59] <scri66le> no FernandoBasso, before the script.
[11:54:13] <FernandoBasso> duch_kazatel: So, that shouldn't be the problem, should it?
[12:21:23] <Phil-Work> given a jQuery object containing dom elements, I want to get the dom element (within the existing jQuery object) that immediately proceeds a particular dom element that I have in a separate variable but is also in the jquery object
[12:21:28] <Phil-Work> what's the easiest way of doing that?
[12:21:53] <Phil-Work> e.g. given {1,2,3,4,5} a search for 3 would return 4
[12:23:48] <MikeD_> do you want the next element in the DOM from 3 or the next item in the collection?
[12:24:01] <MikeD_> if you search for 5, does it return null ?
[12:25:31] <Phil-Work> MikeD_, the next element in the collection
[12:25:46] <Phil-Work> MikeD_, what a search for 5 returns doesn't really matter - it could be {}, [] or null
[12:26:34] <BillCriswell> UGh.
[12:26:38] <MikeD_> isn't this what .filter() is for?
[12:27:39] <Phil-Work> MikeD_, possibly - what selector does this?
[12:28:26] <MikeD_> do you have a jsfiddle?
[12:29:05] <Phil-Work> not really - I haven't made much of a start on anything with regards to this part of it
[12:29:49] <MikeD_> if you make a simplified mockup, it'll help you/us understand what you're asking and it'll help us help you :)
[12:30:04] <Phil-Work> one solution seems to be to use .index() to get the index of the searched element and then ++ to get the next
[12:30:15] <Phil-Work> with some basic bounds checking to make sure it doesn't go beyond the end
[12:31:00] <MikeD_> *shrug* idk
[12:40:42] <ThoMe> hiho

[13:12:06] <BillCriswell> Sweeeeet, my bank has charging me for something they never enrolled me in apparenty.
[13:12:11] <BillCriswell> Finally a bank error in my favor.
[13:12:41] <BillCriswell> my bank was*
[13:13:00] <duch_kazatel> oops.
[13:14:21] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: Heck yes.
[13:14:35] <BillCriswell> I appreciate the honesty though.
[13:14:55] <BillCriswell> They were charging me for like.... 10 years lol
[13:16:28] <marc_v92> BillCriswell: Did they say they’re reimbursing you for the entire 10 years?
[13:16:36] <BillCriswell> marc_v92: Yes.
[13:17:26] <marc_v92> BillCriswell: Lucky. A few years back, I came back from college to find that they failed to switch me to a Student account when I left for college (despite calling them to make the switch), and had been charging me the entire time. They refused to reimburse more than 6 months. Said it was my responsibility to check on the account.
[13:17:42] <BillCriswell> marc_v92: That blows.
[13:18:05] <marc_v92> Yup. Oh well, luckily the account I had at the time was only a couple bucks a month.

[13:19:15] <marc_v92> BillCriswell: TD
[13:19:30] <BillCriswell> marc_v92: Ah, that's who I left this bank for about a year ago.
[13:19:41] <marc_v92> BillCriswell: They’re usually great. Been with them since I was like, 12. That’s the only time I ever had any sort of issue with them.
[13:19:45] <BillCriswell> (The bank was/is sovereign)
[13:19:56] <BillCriswell> marc_v92: YEah, so far they seem great.
[13:20:11] <BillCriswell> The $100 minimum balance sucks because I don't pay attention.
[13:21:46] <marc_v92> Lol, I do most of my banking/bills online now, so luckily I’m in there pretty often to keep an eye on things. Only went under my minimum balance once because of a glitch in their app, but they happily refunded the monthly charge, so it worked out.

[13:23:30] <BillCriswell> marc_v92: Niiice.
[13:23:31] <marc_v92> ThoMe: Haven’t used it personally, but a 2-second Google search for “HTML5 video lighbox jquery” turned this up as the top result: http://html5box.com/html5lightbox/
[13:24:19] <ThoMe> marc_v92: also sond?
[13:24:25] <xp_prg> I have a weird problem, I am using a jquery slider and it has some specific css that I want to change for the last slider, I am not clear how to do that as the sliders are instantiated when the web page loads so all css is already specified
[13:24:48] <marc_v92> ThoMe: I can’t imagine any video player that would cut out the sound, lol.
[13:25:05] <ThoMe> :-)
[13:25:09] <xp_prg> oh wait I think I might know what to do
[13:27:16] <marc_v92> BillCriswell: I
[13:27:25] <marc_v92> Whoops, hit Enter by mistake, one sec, lol.
[13:27:50] <viknesh> anyone here used highlight.js ??
[13:28:25] <marc_v92> BillCriswell: Nevermind, disregard that last message.
[13:28:58] <BillCriswell> marc_v92: Deal!
[13:32:58] <BillCriswell> Shit, I think I broke Chrome.
[13:33:29] <BillCriswell> It's not giving me any of the applied styles.
[13:34:21] <BillCriswell> wow this is really weird.
[13:35:23] <BillCriswell> Woo, restart.
[13:37:58] <sardok> Hi everyone, i have a question, i am using toggleClass, after and before console.log shows that class attribute of the element is changed properly, but it does not have any effect on already loaded page as though the changed element is not rendered, what could be the possible issue? thanks.
[13:39:48] <marc_v92> sardok: Can you post your code to jsfiddle so that we can see what might be going on?
[13:39:57] <marc_v92> BillCriswell: Heh, nice!
[13:41:19] <BillCriswell> The only style it noticed was the system stylesheet I guess for a chrome incognito tab
[13:51:06] <sardok> marc_v92: here is the fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/TbA6q/
[13:51:55] <viknesh> how do i wrap the text in the list view in jquery mobile , when i resize the window the text dont wrap down
[13:54:41] <blakespot> so
[13:54:53] <blakespot> I have a bunch of blocks that have hide / reveal parts to them
[13:54:57] <blakespot> they are all of the same class
[13:54:59] <blakespot> each block
[13:55:20] <blakespot> I want to trigger each individually on tap tho
[13:55:38] <blakespot> (handling desktop / mouse hover with CSS3 :hover transitions)
[13:55:59] <blakespot> so...doing jquery for touchstart and I've used custom data fields (incremented #) for each block
[13:56:05] <blakespot> data-mycount="1" ...
[13:56:41] <blakespot> knowing the class name and the custom data value, how can I trigger an even when that item is activated in jquery
[13:57:19] <blakespot> basically $('.classname').data(...).click(function...
[13:57:31] <blakespot> something that references the item by class + custom data elemenet
[13:57:35] <blakespot> any ideas?
[13:58:18] <marc_v92> sardok: You’re currently using toggleClass() on the “a” element. Stick it on the td instead to get the desired result.
[13:58:56] <marc_v92> sardok: http://jsfiddle.net/TbA6q/1/
[13:59:12] <marc_v92> 5pm, quitting time! Later.
[14:28:21] <duch_kazatel> weeee
[14:31:51] <rooty__> i’m trying to load some elements in 4 by 4, though I don’t think my idea behind it is correct - could somehow point me in the right direction of loading in my elements? So far I have hide them except the first 4, then as you scroll the rest are added. Ideally i would prefer it if 4 would load in each time the user reaches the bottom of the windows height - http://jsfiddle.net/fxJ7s/5/
[14:50:13] <Akuw> hi, i am trying to test but no works  http://jqueryui.com/dialog/#animated
[14:51:12] <duch_kazatel> !paste @ akuw
[14:51:12] <b-ot> akuw: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[14:57:12] <converge> can I have something like it? $("#PaymentMethod15" OR "#PaymentMethod99").on("click", function(){
[14:57:24] <Akuw> i uploaded, there run OK, but local no
[14:57:35] <duch_kazatel> converge - $("#PaymentMethod15, #PaymentMethod99")
[14:57:47] <converge> duch_kazatel: thanks
[14:58:27] <duch_kazatel> akuw any console errors?
[14:58:42] <Akuw> no
[14:59:00] <duch_kazatel> what version of jquery and what version of jquery ui
[14:59:00] <duch_kazatel> ?
[15:02:12] <Akuw> http://jsbin.com/nazizawe/1/edit
[15:03:44] <duch_kazatel> http://jsbin.com/kuconika/2/edit
[15:03:49] <duch_kazatel> works fine.
[15:04:06] <Akuw> but local no
[15:04:20] <duch_kazatel> is that exactly what you have on your local machine?
[15:06:27] <duch_kazatel> Akuw and when you say "local" i assume you mean that you have an html file on your hard drive you're editing and opening directly, instead of through a server.  is that right?
[15:07:22] <Akuw> yes
[15:07:45] <duch_kazatel> easy fix - put http:// in front of all the external resource links locally.
[15:07:55] <duch_kazatel> so any time you see href="//code.jquery.com/, change it do href="http://code.jquery.com/
[15:08:00] <duch_kazatel> *do = to
[15:08:09] <Akuw> hoo ok
[15:09:04] <Akuw> it works
[15:09:09] <Akuw> thanks
[15:09:25] <duch_kazatel> you were trying to link relative to file:// - no good ;)
[15:30:30] <rooty__> how come the size() method is working here, but length() isn’t? http://jsfiddle.net/nFd7C/327/
[15:30:59] <duch_kazatel> because .length() isn't a method?
[15:31:15] <tw2113> i think it's a property
[15:31:16] <rooty__> The .size() method is deprecated as of jQuery 1.8. Use the .length property instead.
[15:31:19] <duch_kazatel> use the .length property
[15:31:22] <duch_kazatel> not method.
[15:31:23] <duch_kazatel> drop the ()
[15:31:28] <rooty__> ok :)
[15:31:35] <tw2113> .length > .length()
[15:32:15] <rooty__> silly me! time for bed soon :D
[15:32:35] <viknesh> have anyone use highlight.js ??
[15:33:17] <viknesh> i get the code highlighted when i open the html individually , however wont work when i link it
[15:34:02] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[15:36:12] <viknesh> duch_kazatel: in index.html i did <a href="to_the_html_file_with_highlightjs">
[15:36:26] <duch_kazatel> !paste @ viknesh

[15:48:01] <PantsOfChoco> bedtime
[15:49:55] <rooty__> http://jsfiddle.net/fxJ7s/14/ any way to load these items in more as 3 by 3 instead of all at once?
[15:50:17] <adamsilver> Any better way to say this: $(this).parentsUntil('.col-md-4').parent() ?
[15:50:34] <duch_kazatel> adamsilver you want the parent of .col-md-4?
[15:51:05] <adamsilver> duch_kazatel: no I want .col-md-4
[15:51:13] <viknesh> duch_kazatel: but how do i add highlight.js in  jsfiddle , just copy paste the source the source file of it ??
[15:51:34] <duch_kazatel> adamsilver $(this).closest('.col-md-4')
[15:51:37] <viknesh> its 4am here :P
[15:52:09] <adamsilver> duch_kazatel: thanks
[15:52:14] <duch_kazatel> viknesh t the parent of .col-md-4?

[15:52:16] <duch_kazatel> woops
[15:52:21] <duch_kazatel> viknesh you want http://i.imgur.com/hqgBEFO.png
[15:52:30] <duch_kazatel> just link it there.
[15:55:42] <rooty__> http://jsfiddle.net/fxJ7s/14/ this fiddle currently loads in all of the items at once, though i know the code is loading 3 by 3, but I don’t think the height of the window has been updated so could this be why all the rest of the elements are shown at once?
[15:56:28] <decx> this is ridiculous rooty_
[15:56:52] <duch_kazatel> rooty__ I think you're confused about how scroll events work
[15:56:54] <decx> step away for a moment and realize how userfriendly it is to have to reach the bottom
[15:57:03] <decx> before 3 more appear
[15:57:24] <rooty__> I want to create a simple infinite load technique
[15:57:57] <rooty__> Maybe this http://jsfiddle.net/nFd7C/327/ demonstrates better what I want? But instead of the on click function I want them to load as the user scrolls down.
[16:57:25] <paul_uk> hey, i’ve googled but not found something to my needs.  does anyone know of a very basic uml jquery plugin where inside jquery canvas perhaps allows you to build a uml diagram like organizational chart from right to left ?
[16:57:30] <paul_uk> left ro right rather
[16:59:50] <duch_kazatel> this is probably the closest you'll get: http://www.jrromero.net/tools/jsUML2
[17:06:25] <Akuw> i have a doubt, i have an application, but every time i refresh page tables takes some time to show
[17:06:43] <duch_kazatel> bummer
[17:08:57] <Blaster> if you have a variable with a reference to an element, is there a way to renew that reference after reloading the page with ajax?
[17:09:06] <Blaster> It seems like the reference goes state.
[17:09:09] <Blaster> stale*
[17:09:36] <duch_kazatel> Blaster that variable is a "cached" reference - whenever you call $(), you're running a constructor.
[17:09:44] <duch_kazatel> if you need to update, you need to re-run the selector.
[17:10:54] <Blaster> Okay I see.
[17:11:36] <duch_kazatel> make sense?
[17:12:23] <Blaster> Yeah, but my code isn't working properly.
[17:12:33] <duch_kazatel> mind sharing it in a fiddle?
[17:12:39] <duch_kazatel> it's fine if the ajax part doesn't work.
[17:12:58] <Blaster> Sure, but I have to make an AJAX request that returns an identical form fragment, and I am not sure how I would do that with a fiddle.
[17:13:07] <Akuw> what do you think duch_kazatel ? about my table problem
[17:13:18] <duch_kazatel> Blaster i just said it's fine if the ajax part doesn't work.
[17:13:34] <Blaster> How can I simulate the problem without it?
[17:13:35] <duch_kazatel> Akuw i can't help you with that little info.
[17:13:44] <duch_kazatel> Blaster no need to simulate in this case.  just want to see the code :
[17:13:53] <Blaster> Oh okay.  One minute.
[17:19:18] <Blaster> duch_kazatel, it's like this http://jsfiddle.net/6xXE2/1/
[17:21:29] <duch_kazatel> looking.
[17:23:05] <duch_kazatel> something here seems... off.
[17:23:18] <Blaster> Why's that?
[17:23:35] <duch_kazatel> the callback only takes one argument.
[17:24:04] <duch_kazatel> what do you exect elem to be?
[17:24:13] <Blaster> The select element.
[17:24:30] <Blaster> I need to refocus it after the form gets reloaded via AJAX.
[17:24:35] <duch_kazatel> then use $(event.target)
[17:24:47] <duch_kazatel> the callback for .on() can only take one arg.
[17:25:30] <Blaster> Okay I will try that.
[17:27:05] <Blaster> duch_kazatel, I am getting Object[ Document.create ] in my code when I console.log($(event.target)).
[17:27:34] <duch_kazatel> oh, because you're emitting the event from document.  i see that.  why are you triggering events like that?
[17:27:38] <duch_kazatel> seems really strange.
[17:28:36] <Blaster> I have various forms on my site that need to be reloaded over AJAX, so I just trigger that event when I need the form to be serialized and submitted to the form's action.
[17:28:57] <duch_kazatel> you should consider just doing event delegation for everything and not emitting events like you are now.
[17:29:14] <Blaster> How come?
[17:29:54] <duch_kazatel> it's a lot more normal to see it that way.  you're using one event to trigger another event, which is completely unnecessary.
[17:30:57] <Blaster> So do you think I should just make the updateForm function global and then call that from on change events?
[17:31:25] <duch_kazatel> let me show you what i';m thinking.
[17:31:34] <Blaster> Okay thanks.
[17:32:16] <duch_kazatel> http://fixee.org/paste/4tlanr6/
[17:32:20] <duch_kazatel> keep is simple.
[17:32:24] <Blaster> One caveat is that I have this spread between multiple js files.   Firing my own event was just an alternative I used rather than making the updateForm function gobal.
[17:32:35] <Blaster> global*
[17:33:15] <Blaster> Yeha that makes snese.
[17:33:21] <Blaster> Yeah that makes sense. *
[17:34:00] <PantsOfChoco> NO IT MAKES SNESE
[17:34:03] <Blaster> So say I have the makeAjaxRequest in a different JS file than the $(document).on('change') (is that the delegator you mentioned)?
[17:34:06] <PantsOfChoco> gary sinese
[17:34:14] <duch_kazatel> shit i was about to say that PantsOfChoco
[17:34:30] <Blaster> Haha.  Drank too many beers for a Monday.
[17:34:41] <duch_kazatel> Blaster just bind a listener wherever you need it.
[17:35:14] <Blaster> Okay but that makeAjaxRequest needs to be in the global scope so I can reference it from other JS files, right?
[17:35:43] <duch_kazatel> something about this smells - it would need to be in a shared scope, yes.  but why is it in a separate file?
[17:35:57] <duch_kazatel> why not attach it to a single, global object instead?
[17:37:02] <Blaster> Well I have a reload-form.js file which handles reloading forms, and a location-select.js form which handles the location selection form specifically.
[17:37:14] <Blaster> location-select.js file I mean. :)
[17:37:31] <duch_kazatel> then keep the separation, though that's a little excessive if you asked me.
[17:38:21] <Blaster> I am using a framework that compiles them all into a single file and compresses them upon serving the response.   But do you think that's even too much for development?
[17:38:51] <duch_kazatel> yes.
[17:39:06] <duch_kazatel> you're getting down to "one function per file" at a certain point.
[17:39:28] <duch_kazatel> it's fine to have a file that handles forms for a given page.
[17:39:48] <duch_kazatel> and separate things out inside of it as necessary.  but multiple files for that seems funky.
[17:40:07] <Blaster> Okay.
[17:40:23] <Blaster> I'll take your word for it.   There was a more specific reason I did it but I can't remember right now.
[17:41:15] <Blaster> So I should put all the listeners that happen to reload the form into my reload-form.js file directly?
[17:41:47] <duch_kazatel> i'd put all your logic handling forms into one file.
[17:42:35] <Blaster> Alright.
[17:43:22] <Blaster> Thanks for your help.  I was definitely going down the wrong path.
[17:43:54] <duch_kazatel> of course.
[17:44:05] <duch_kazatel> it's all about finding balance
[17:44:59] <paul_uk> duch_kazatel: thanks i saw that when i googled.  its an editor rather than scripting a diagram in your own app
[17:46:38] <Blaster> duch_kazatel, here's how my reload-form.js looks now, anything else seem smelly? https://gist.github.com/redstar504/df29c90b0075cfdb062b
[17:51:08] <coxaLT> Hello there! I have quick question
[17:51:57] <coxaLT> How could i define function with .append(), .after() etc.. before document elements has been loaded
[17:55:17] <coxaLT> I mean, to put javascript code before <body>
[18:05:03] <__joshua___> you can defined it when ou want, as load as you don't invoke it before ready
[18:05:13] <__joshua___> ou=you, load=long
[18:19:12] <coxaLT> I try to create some elements with .html ,
[18:20:18] <coxaLT> when i do html('<div>test</div>') i cannot see anyting, but when i try .html('test') it works.
[18:21:25] <coxaLT> is there a way in query to create elements without using < or > ?
[18:21:37] <coxaLT> * in jquery
[18:21:57] <coxaLT> just using tag name
[18:22:02] <coxaLT> * specifying
[18:22:14] <BillCriswell> coxaLT: Seems like an odd constraint.
[18:23:04] <BillCriswell> Xoro: What are you trying to do .html('<div>test</div>') to?
[18:23:30] <Xoro> Wat
[18:23:53] <BillCriswell> coxaLT: * Sorry haha.
[18:24:03] <BillCriswell> Might be dyslexic.
[18:24:19] <coxaLT> I used .html as example
[18:24:47] <coxaLT> normaly i would use .append
[18:25:06] <BillCriswell> .append() would only do the same thing as .html() on an empty element.
[18:25:07] <coxaLT> BillCriswell, what do you mean?
[18:26:28] <BillCriswell> coxaLT: http://jsbin.com/somosovi/1/edit?html,js,output hwhat is this doing that's not supposed to?
[18:28:51] <coxaLT> I dont understand?
[18:32:32] <coxaLT> So is there a way to create an element without using <  > characters, something like .html('div') instead .html('<html>')
[18:43:23] <kes89newbee1> Is there any jquery plugin to auto detect html elements(may be only buttons and links or all) on mouseover on any area of a page? Kind of Chrome Inspect Element?
