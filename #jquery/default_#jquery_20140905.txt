[00:09:24] <AdamPDotty> look at .load()
[00:11:48] <workerbeetwo> AdamPDotty: Im working on it all the time. it does not work yet.
[00:29:49] <AdamPDotty> I only look here once in a while, but if you have a concrete question I try to help.
[01:40:38] <oskob> is there a way to trace an error to the source if it happens in jquery.js?
[01:40:44] <oskob> like a stack trace
[01:45:54] <jop008> I add li items to an ul I use .selectmenu() and refresh is true and parent(0.trigger (create) but not goog rendered
[01:46:19] <Woet> oskob: you mean like in a minified file?
[01:46:59] <oskob> well the error is triggered inside jquery.min.js, but i want to know what file and line it originates from
[01:47:21] <oskob> http://cl.ly/image/091G1J45193Q
[01:47:32] <Woet> http://jquery.com/download/
[01:47:44] <oskob> ?
[01:47:48] <Woet> get the map file
[01:49:14] <oskob> how should i use this?
[01:50:13] <Woet> http://www.elijahmanor.com/the-magic-of-the-jquery-1-9-source-map/
[01:51:17] <oskob> hmm just to be sure, im not interested in what line in unminified jquery
[01:51:25] <oskob> i wanna know what script is calling it
[01:52:09] <oskob> like jquery.mylousyscript.js
[01:55:31] <jop008>  solved      osort_ul.append(ctext).listview('refresh');
[01:56:24] <d3m0n> I am running an ajax call to perform a php function of grabbing text from a file and displaying it. But it seems like ajax is limiting my results. Does it have an automatic cut off time if the call takes too long?
[01:57:38] <oskob> if i just could get chrome to breakpoint on errors
[02:16:36] <john-dev> d3m0n: could you show us your code
[02:17:55] <d3m0n> Sure john-dev, http://pastebin.com/ESdhvfps
[02:18:09] <d3m0n> ItemLogs.php out puts raw 26k lines of data
[02:18:55] <john-dev> how long does the actual requests take, ca.?
[02:18:56] <d3m0n> If I just dump itemlogs.php onto my page it shows all my data, but if i throw it through that ajax call its limits
[02:19:16] <d3m0n> roughly 5-15 seconds
[02:19:33] <d3m0n> it's limited*
[02:19:48] <john-dev> how big is your txt file?
[02:19:53] <d3m0n> ~5mb
[02:20:04] <d3m0n> It's a continual growth too
[02:20:09] <d3m0n> AS it's a log file
[02:20:16] <john-dev> does it always break at the same point?
[02:20:28] <d3m0n> Let me check
[02:21:45] <d3m0n> Yeah it does john-dev
[02:22:00] <d3m0n> THe ajax call takes maybe 1-3 seconds
[02:22:00] <john-dev> are there any special chars or something that could messup?
[02:22:29] <d3m0n> This is the exact line it breaks at: "[04:51:34] <Runner> <Dropped> (magic) Smoking Large Charm of Balance (85) | Keep in Inventory to Gain Bonus | Required Level: 39 | +8% Faster Hit Recovery | Adds 8-13 fire damage {cainID}"
[02:22:38] <d3m0n> It stops at: "[04:51:34] "
[02:22:41] <john-dev> can you try to touput another: echo „done“; and see if this one is running
[02:23:13] <john-dev> hmh.. i bet there are other < and > before that poin right?
[02:23:19] <d3m0n> Yea
[02:23:20] <d3m0n> lots
[02:23:31] <john-dev> can you remove that line for texting purposes?
[02:23:41] <john-dev> testing*
[02:24:44] <d3m0n> Yeah, one sec let me try i'll create a new file
[02:24:54] <john-dev> ok..
[02:27:38] <john-dev> btw, you should think about „pagination“.. 26k lines might be possible, but as it grows continuelsy, there will occur problems in the future.. for example due to php’s max ram limit
[02:28:02] <john-dev> continuously
[02:28:15] <d3m0n> Yeah this is in the very basic testing stage
[02:28:19] <john-dev> k
[02:28:21] <d3m0n> And you were right
[02:28:25] <d3m0n> That's so weird
[02:28:30] <john-dev> it’s just that line?
[02:28:31] <d3m0n> I took out all teh <>
[02:28:34] <john-dev> oh
[02:28:40] <d3m0n> And it printed eveyrthing
[02:29:07] <d3m0n> I am confused how that would even effect anything, as it's just a string.
[02:29:20] <d3m0n> wonder if htmlentities would fix that
[02:29:34] <john-dev> try http://de1.php.net/manual/en/function.htmlspecialchars.php
[02:29:47] <john-dev> ah
[02:29:49] <john-dev> wait
[02:29:53] <john-dev> use .text instead of .html
[02:30:02] <john-dev> since your output is text, not html..
[02:30:05] <d3m0n> I am using .txt
[02:30:18] <john-dev>  $('.items').text(feed);
[02:30:19] <john-dev> :)
[02:30:29] <d3m0n> DOH
[02:30:38] <john-dev> should work as expected
[02:31:11] <d3m0n> Annndd it did
[02:31:14] <john-dev> = )
[02:31:16] * d3m0n smacks head.
[02:31:20] <john-dev> yeah, me too^^..
[02:31:35] <d3m0n> Thanks john-dev!
[02:31:39] <john-dev> you are welcome
[02:31:51] <d3m0n> I guess i never thought about it since it printed about 1/8th of it
[02:32:00] <john-dev> it’s intresting it did..
[02:32:00] <d3m0n> First assumption was it was hanging
[02:32:27] <john-dev> maybe <Runner> is some weird html easteregg
[02:32:49] <d3m0n> lmao
[02:43:56] <marcospgp_> hey, I'm trying to edit the draggable widget because there is a small bug with my page that isn't a formal bug, just something that happens due to how my page works. The thing is the source code seems pretty complicated and I can't seem to find my way around it /: how should I proceed?
[02:59:49] <tga> greetings
[03:00:27] <tga> when trying to concat all my vendor files into a single bundle I start getting errors in jquery's globalEval, looks like window.eval.call doesn't exist (anymore)
[03:00:40] <tga> does this happen to ring a bell for anyone?
[03:00:52] <palzie> hi, is there a way to check the scripts that have errors inside it while loading a page ?
[03:02:23] <AdamPDotty> palzie: like pressing F12?
[03:03:51] <palzie> i have no clue about how I can check which scripts are making my website crash at some points with firebug "debugger"
[03:04:34] <AdamPDotty> if you do not know where to start, Firefoxes browser console is great, to fix it use breakpoints (easier in Chrome)
[03:05:10] <AdamPDotty> firebug spams the console, so I hardly use it
[03:05:31] <palzie> well the thing is that for some reason some scripts aren't loaded even though i didn't touch a shit on them
[03:05:40] <palzie> and i gotta find whose
[03:05:57] <AdamPDotty> ...
[03:33:49] <DarsVaeda> I animate to scrollTop of an element, also I want to remove that element on mouseleave, problem is that by animating to the position the mouse leaves the element and get's removed...how could I prevent this? http://pastebin.com/kB5i1ecm
[03:38:01] <sash_> Hi, I have a, perhaps dumb, question.
[03:39:03] <sash_> Why does $("#moobutton").click(function(){moo();}); work as expected, but $("#moobutton").click(moo()); is executed on dom ready
[03:39:38] <sash_> moo() is defines as function moo(){console.log("moo");}
[03:40:23] <AdamPDotty> moo is the function
[03:40:30] <AdamPDotty> moo() is the result of the function
[03:41:00] <AdamPDotty> you put an anonymous function around it, but do not call it
[03:41:03] <rudeboy> Hey guys, I have this little snippet to display the email in an alert box. However, it displays multiple alerts with all the emails, how can I target just the one clicked? Using $(this) somehow? http://paste.ofcode.org/398JJCNkuyTTR7qd5zLQFtN
[03:41:06] <AdamPDotty> so moo does not get called
[03:41:31] <AdamPDotty> so just $("#moobutton").click(moo);
[03:41:52] <AdamPDotty> I prefer $("#moobutton").on('click', moo);
[03:42:22] <sash_> AdamPDotty: Thanks, that really does help :)
[03:45:09] <AdamPDotty> rudeboy: I guess the snippet is not close enough to your reality
[03:45:53] <sash_> Never thought about the need to call functions without brackets...
[03:45:59] <rudeboy> AdamPDotty, I just noticed my mistake now ha ha, I was messing around with trying to do it with PHP earlier, was still loading that
[03:46:54] <rudeboy> AdamPDotty, Any ideas how I can display an email pulled from a database with PHP in jQuery?
[03:48:06] <rudeboy> AdamPDotty, Or should I rather do something like: http://paste.ofcode.org/ypD3ysZxBSHKni5qckx6EG ?
[03:48:34] <rudeboy> Just not sure how to refer to the email being clicked, as opposed to all the emails on that page
[03:49:49] <AdamPDotty> the event handler will call the function only for the clicked element
[03:50:17] <AdamPDotty> to get data from php to js, there are some possibilities
[03:50:28] <AdamPDotty> what you have shown is most straightforward
[03:50:42] <AdamPDotty> you can also use an hidden input field or such
[03:50:59] <AdamPDotty> or an AJAX call (more complicated)
[03:51:04] <rudeboy> AdamPDotty, Using the event handler sounds like a good option, must just google what that is quick ha ha:) I'm just trying to hide the emails from spammers
[03:51:18] <AdamPDotty> or even "print" an external js-file with phh
[03:51:21] <AdamPDotty> php
[03:52:05] <rudeboy> AdamPDotty, Oh, is an event handler just the actual "function" :) So should I then use onclick amybe?
[03:52:16] <AdamPDotty> you would usually encode it in some way, then decode when clicked
[03:52:16] <rudeboy> maybe
[03:52:28] <AdamPDotty> irgs
[03:52:53] <AdamPDotty> no, you still use element[s].on('click', handler);
[03:53:16] <AdamPDotty> like in your first example
[03:53:57] <rudeboy> AdamPDotty, Ok. Let me try that quick. I'm also using an antispam wordpress function that encodes it
[03:56:33] <rudeboy> AdamPDotty, Something like this? http://paste.ofcode.org/n3NJqbfZzfhV3txdWS7nPD? Something is still wrong though
[03:57:38] <rudeboy> AdamPDotty, It shows the same email address multiple times, and also the same one no matter which email is actually clicked
[03:58:27] <AdamPDotty> ; after { irritates but I do not see an error
[03:58:46] <AdamPDotty> ach
[03:59:06] <AdamPDotty> maybe an "echo" in the php part?
[04:00:36] <sash_> How should we debug this without knowing the php file?
[04:00:39] <rudeboy> AdamPDotty, Drats, still no luck
[04:01:18] <rudeboy> sash_, This is all in the PHP side: <?php echo antispambot(get_field('email')); ?>
[04:01:47] <sash_> but where do you tell it, which email it shall find?
[04:02:17] <sash_> there must be some logic for the program to query the database.
[04:02:41] <AdamPDotty> plus: we do not know the markup
[04:03:19] <rudeboy> sash_, I'm using Wordpress with a plugin called ACF. All I need to do is put get_field('field') or the_field('field')
[04:04:10] <sash_> Okay, I don't know that.
[04:05:17] <sash_> What you need (from a programmer's point of view) is some identifier of the element you click, pass it to the php function, query the database using the identifier and return the email string
[04:06:28] <rudeboy> sash_, If I wrap that function in a div, can't I just display that div in an alert box the same as Iwould hide it with css and then display when clicked?
[04:06:57] <sash_> Wrapping it in a div would make it visible in the html code.
[04:07:11] <sash_> I thought, you didn't want that.
[04:07:39] <rudeboy> sash_, Not with that antispambot function. If you look at the source code, the email is all jumbled
[04:09:58] <rudeboy> Or am I missing something?
[04:25:54] <fpghost84> Hi, I'm using the jQuery mixitup script on this page http://logicon.no-ip.org/#link-portfolio . The problem is the delay animating the images on the initial page load means that if the user goes from an external page (non index page) to the #link-contact section the top of the page is misaligned...similiary if the user submits an  invalid contact-form so that the page reloads it again is misaligned
[04:26:28] <fpghost84> I'd like to figure out a way to wait for the mixitup panel to finish its animation before redirecting the user to the hash location
[04:27:14] <fpghost84> it does have a "mixItEnd" callback (currently set to a js alert for illustration), but this would then callback every time the user sorts, not just the initial page load animation
[04:43:53] <SimonP86> Hi all, I'm trying to chain together several asynchronous calls using the Promise object's .then() method but I'm not getting the result I expect.  I've written up the following test-case: http://jsfiddle.net/sm0nyLdq/3/ This shows an alert after ~2000 milliseconds, rather than the ~7234 milliseconds I'd expect.  Can anyone point out what I'm doing wrong?
[04:49:58] <SimonP86> exit
[04:51:24] <jotterbot> does anyone have a mechanism to sort values in an 2 arrays, and if they match, filter based on another shared attribute in both arrays?
[04:51:38] <jotterbot> haha, i know that is very broad
[04:52:10] <jotterbot> in 2 arrays*
[04:53:40] <rgman> jotterbot: I don't really understand your problem, but it sounds like something you'll need to code from scratch.
[04:55:06] <jotterbot> basically i need to check if two names match, and if they do, then only "care" about the entry with the most recent date
[04:56:01] <jotterbot> i have an array of "job" objects that have a name and other information, and an array of "invoice" objects with an associated job name and other information
[04:56:30] <jotterbot> i need to match the invoice to the job based on the shared Name. and if there are multiple invoices then just take the object that has the most recent date
[04:57:07] <jotterbot> it's challenging for me and is really rustling my jimmies
[04:59:29] <rgman> jotterbot: I think you'll need to work with nested loops. First, sort the invoice objects array by date.
[05:00:35] <jotterbot> rgman: ah i see, and then like break on match
[05:01:33] <jotterbot> or so long as indexof name doesn't exist in the output array i am pushing too...
[05:01:51] <jotterbot> if i'm sorting by date it's like first in first serve
[05:02:27] <rgman> jotterbot: Yes, you could try that as an initial approach. But if you break the internal loop, it won't be efficient.
[05:03:53] <rgman> Every time the outer loop iterartes, the inner will be starting all over again from the very first element.
[05:04:13] <jotterbot> rgman: yeah, probably not using break, just so long as i can guarantee most recent date first, then i can just check if my output array doesn't already contain the same name
[05:06:33] <rgman> You need to keep two indexes. One for each array.
[05:11:14] <jotterbot> this is doing my head in haha
[05:12:05] <rgman> You could use break in the inner loop, but when the next outer loop iteration enters, the inner loop should start from the last index.
[05:12:16] <rgman> This is getting messy. I'll try to code something.
[05:13:01] <jotterbot> no dramas mate :)
[05:13:05] <jotterbot> I can try and sanitise my code and show you what i'm working with
[05:13:28] <rgman> jotterbot: Great. Let's see.
[05:14:36] <jotterbot> rgman: now I'm really caught out, because I'm not actually using jquery :S
[05:14:53] <jotterbot> it's google apps script
[05:15:01] <jotterbot> haha, perhaps though this won't be a problem ...
[05:15:14] <Tomashe> guys i need some help , this always get me 0 someloop { sub[sub.length] = value2.id;	console.log(sub.length); }
[05:15:55] <tuskkk___> is it possible to upload an image and show it on the same page using AJAX?
[05:15:56] <tuskkk___> without the involvement of any server.
[05:16:08] <Jagst3r21> any idea why jQuery cycle 2 is not working here? http://b4bpod.staging.wpengine.com/
[05:16:21] <jotterbot> rgman: http://pastebin.com/GxqF1GE5  . Sorry, this is probably not helpful
[05:16:28] <rgman> tuskkk___: What do you mean with without the involvement of any server?
[05:16:59] <rgman> jotterbot: Let's have a look.
[05:17:23] <tuskkk___> rgman: like just for demo purpose, in a plain html file, upload an image and show it there
[05:17:27] <Jagst3r21> anyone? :(
[05:17:29] <krasimir> is there a channel for fckeditor ? I can't find in the docs how allow tabs to leave empty space instead of moving the focus.
[05:17:31] <jotterbot> rgman: should mention a quote response looks like this http://www.workflowmax.com/api/quote-methods
[05:20:06] <rgman> tuskkk___: For security purposes, Javascript can't access to files in the client device. That's why you it's not actually AJAX what's being used when a file it's uploaded asynchronously.
[05:25:57] <jim87> hello! I'd like to associate a custom event to an object (which is extended by a plugin I'm creating), something like myObject.on('my.custom.event', function () { ... }); but it doesn't trigger even if I do $.event.trigger with type 'my.custom.event'... what am I doing wrong?
[05:26:14] <jim87> $(document).on('my.custom.event', function () {}) works though
[05:26:30] <jotterbot> rgman: i gotta head off
[05:26:33] <jotterbot> thanks for offering suggestions though ;)
[05:26:43] <rgman> jotterbot: No problem. I'm trying something here.
[05:27:18] <jotterbot> rgman: no worries, I'll hit up this IRC, and perhaps I can catch you again
[05:28:55] <emx> i am looking for the documentation about datafilter for "remote" validation method. either i'm blind or it's not there: http://jqueryvalidation.org/documentation
[05:44:55] <sacho> jim87, do you have sample code?
[05:50:24] <Jagst3r21> hey
[05:50:32] <Jagst3r21> so I tried adding some code to auto calculate the height of the container here: http://pastebin.com/whBuMvpz
[05:50:38] <Jagst3r21> but its not working here :(   http://b4bpod.staging.wpengine.com/
[05:52:01] <Jagst3r21> anyone have an idea? :/
[05:52:53] <DansVC> Hi, someone can tell me what this code does? I think this is virus
[05:52:54] <DansVC> https://apiuseclearthink-a.akamaihd.net/gsrs?is=isgiwhPT&bp=BAS&g=b6a8988e-bcb2-475e-9bd8-73931bd64afc
[05:58:44] <DansVC> help me
[05:59:03] <jim87> sacho: I've resolved with simply using $(this).trigger('my.custom.event')... this way it's local and not global
[05:59:31] <jim87> sacho: though I'd like to know why I can't listen to "global events" with my own object, but I need to use $(document)
[06:01:06] <tuskkk___> how to redo the syntax indentation?
[06:01:25] <tuskkk___> I downloaded a script which is kind of compressed
[06:01:58] <sacho> jim87, because you're not listening to global events "with your objects".
[06:02:00] <sacho> -s
[06:03:46] <jim87> sacho: what are the objects that can listen global events? Just $(document)?
[06:04:53] <sacho> probably.
[06:07:00] <rgman> tuskkk___: It's probably minimized. This could help http://jsbeautifier.org/
[06:07:17] <sacho> $.event.trigger() isn't part of the public api, I don't think.
[06:07:21] <sacho> Where is it documented?
[06:07:31] <tuskkk___> Ok
[06:07:43] <sacho> also, it accepts a third argument `elem`, which if missing, is assumed to be `document`.
[06:09:09] <jim87> sacho: dunno, I just found that method in pure jQuery (2)
[06:10:12] <sacho> pure jQuery (2)?
[06:11:33] <sacho> $.event.trigger is just the low-level interface for triggering events. $(elem).trigger(event, data) -> $.event.trigger(event, data, elem)
[06:29:20] <blackkbot> low level?
[06:30:05] <blackkbot> EventSource.prototype.dispatchEvent.call is a low level interface for triggering events
[06:32:51] <sacho> jquery doesn't use that.
[06:48:22] <uskerine> how do I go to a URL in jQuery? it was window. something
[06:49:07] <Woet> "in jQuery"?
[06:49:10] <Woet> or.. just javascript
[06:49:31] <uskerine> well
[06:49:33] <uskerine> just javascript
[06:49:37] <uskerine> you are right
[06:50:21] <Woet> i assume you mean window.location
[06:50:41] <john-dev> window.location.href=„“
[06:53:22] <uskerine> thanks
[06:53:35] <uskerine> I am looking to emulate user clicking on the link
[06:53:47] <uskerine> so he can download a PDF
[06:54:17] <uskerine> robertmaxrees told me yesterday but the irc client I use has limited log and I lost it
[06:55:49] <john-dev> simply use window.location.href=„your_link.html“ in an on click event
[06:56:10] <john-dev> if you use php, you could use application/octet-stream as header to force the browser to download a file..
[06:56:50] <uskerine> thanks
[06:57:43] <john-dev> you are welcome
[07:03:25] <User458764> Hi can somenone tells me why the method $.scrollToFeatures doesn;t run on click in this snippet: https://gist.github.com/guibru-sh/f7d95b08111fe6ad3ef0

[07:22:12] <elmcrest> hi everybody. I like to convert my td into a input field when I click on it. but only once and with the existing content as the value of the new input ... my function does that too ofter, meaning on every click ... but I could use an idea how to solve that :) https://dpaste.de/nVC4
[07:22:30] <elmcrest> for all td's on the current page btw ...
[07:23:02] <elmcrest> I mean every td should be clickable and therefor convertable into a input, maybe textarea
[07:23:02] <decx> BillCriswell didnt you do that like 5 months ago?
[07:23:19] <BillCriswell> decx: Yes.
[07:23:27] <BillCriswell> I charge mad monies for it now.
[07:23:31] <decx> ^^
[07:23:39] <BillCriswell> Let me get the earl.
[07:23:42] <decx> dat border: 0
[07:24:14] <mooncup> elmcrest: https://dpaste.de/yUe7
[07:24:47] <elmcrest> mooncup nice, thx
[07:24:54] <BillCriswell> elmcrest: http://jsbin.com/ravibuna/13/edit?html,css,output here you go, you can actually ignore ALL the javascript.
[07:25:28] <decx> much better than dom gymnastics
[07:26:15] <elmcrest> BillCriswell decx ok I would agree but the problem is that input break the bootstrap table-responsive css
[07:26:32] <elmcrest> so I have to convert it back to a normal td when editing is finished to make it usable on mobile
[07:26:45] <elmcrest> at least that was my idea so far
[07:26:49] <decx> with mooncups snippet every additional click will kill the input value
[07:26:56] <decx> because it's going to replace it again and again
[07:27:14] <mooncup> no it wont
[07:27:24] <decx> ah dontdo
[07:27:27] <decx> gotcha
[07:27:30] <elmcrest> decx monokrome - yes ^^
[07:27:37] <elmcrest> ups monokrome sry typo
[07:28:38] <decx> mobile should have no problem with contenteditable anyway
[07:29:09] <elmcrest> decx yes contenteditable would work for the css - but won't work for jquery plugin autoNumeric which I need for calculation
[07:29:33] <decx> damn you and your requirements ;)
[07:30:17] <elmcrest> decx hehe ... the problem is I'm not american and don't like to work with 3.45 + 2.37 = something.something ... 4,56 + 3,54 ftw! :)
[07:30:43] <decx> i'm a pragmatist, so it'll be 5 + 4
[07:30:50] <elmcrest> lol ok
[07:31:30] <elmcrest> decx actually I'm wondering why there isn't a core functionality ... either js or jquery for this
[07:31:37] <elmcrest> I guess thats a common problem
[07:31:47] <mooncup> what is it you're trying to do elmcrest?
[07:32:02] <decx> i'd just stick with styled inputs tbh
[07:32:18] <decx> i dont see how that will make any more problems on mobile than actually using a table
[07:32:42] <elmcrest> mooncup I like to work with locale numbers ... so f.e. calculation 4,56 + 7,89
[07:32:58] <elmcrest> mooncup but inside the db the floats are saved as 4.56 and 7.89 f.e.
[07:33:30] <blackkbot> function americanize(numstr){return parseFloat(numstr.toString().replace(',','.'));} function foreignize(numstr){return numstr.toString().replace('.',',');}
[07:33:55] <mooncup> does your db not have a decimal type?
[07:34:00] <decx> that'll kill 1.000,00
[07:34:05] <elmcrest> yes
[07:34:11] <blackkbot> well don't do that
[07:34:14] <decx> ^^
[07:34:32] <elmcrest> mooncup yes it has ... hmm maybe that's the easiest solution :D
[07:34:32] <decx> doctor doctor, it hurts when i do that - well don't do that
[07:34:40] <elmcrest> except for calculating in jquery
[07:34:56] <BillCriswell> wtf mate.
[07:34:57] <mooncup> is this for money?
[07:35:06] <elmcrest> mooncup yes
[07:35:20] <mooncup> hm
[07:35:22] <elmcrest> mooncup but while calculating I won't need the "€" sign
[07:35:25] <mooncup> php backend?
[07:35:30] <elmcrest> nope python
[07:35:34] <mooncup> ooh shiny
[07:35:39] <mooncup> does python have a decimal type?
[07:35:41] <mooncup> you never know
[07:35:58] <mooncup> https://docs.python.org/2/library/decimal.html
[07:36:00] <mooncup> there you go
[07:36:20] <mooncup> so just do rough calculations using floats and round in the frontend
[07:36:27] <mooncup> then recalculate in the backend with decimals
[07:36:59] <elmcrest> hmm
[07:37:20] <elmcrest> doesn't convice me completly tbh ;)
[07:37:22] <mooncup> or you can convert to int before reaching hte frontend
[07:37:28] <mooncup> by timesing hte decinal by 100
[07:37:38] <mooncup> then divide by 100 just before you output to the user
[07:37:47] <blackkbot> function americanize(numstr){return parseFloat(numstr.toString().replace(/\./gm,"").replace(',','.'));} function foreignize(numstr){return numstr.toString().replace(/,/gm,"").replace('.',',');}
[07:37:54] <blackkbot> its getting more complex
[07:38:15] <elmcrest> quite intelligent your channel bot here :)
[07:38:26] <mooncup> blackkbot: surely it would be easier to strip out the thousand separators, then reformat the number after?
[07:38:33] <elmcrest> interpreting the channel context and stuff ^^
[07:38:58] <blackkbot> i did strip out the thousand seperators i thought
[07:39:08] <mooncup> I wasn't really looking tbf
[07:39:14] <Jattenalle> that is a horrible horrible function
[07:39:30] <BillCriswell> elmcrest: How would the input break the fluidity?
[07:39:31] <blackkbot> it should be more racist
[07:39:53] <blackkbot> Jattenalle its actually 2 funcitons
[07:40:01] <elmcrest> autoNumeric makes stuff like that ... you can use $().autoNumeric('get') to get the "real" float and $().('set') so render it to the needed format (including some exotic countries fyi)
[07:40:09] <mooncup> yo blackkbot http://stackoverflow.com/questions/149055/how-can-i-format-numbers-as-money-in-javascript
[07:40:19] <mooncup> just strip out the thousand separators then use that
[07:40:40] <Jattenalle> why would you ever internally store numbers as strings though?
[07:40:40] <elmcrest> BillCriswell the table is horizontal scrollable when it's a small screen ... but the input field doesn't expand in width with the content
[07:41:17] <blackkbot> Jattenalle because you cannot have numbers with commas in them  and have them be valid primitive numbers
[07:41:20] <BillCriswell> elmcrest: Couldn't you use some `em` magic?
[07:41:43] <Jattenalle> blackkbot, i dont think you read my question..
[07:41:44] <elmcrest> BillCriswell didn't tried that... worth a try --- hold on
[07:42:00] <blackkbot> Jattenalle or you want to have accuracy above 2^53
[07:42:13] * Jattenalle rolls eyes
[07:42:16] <Jattenalle> well, enjoy your code
[07:43:22] <elmcrest> BillCriswell just using a em for the width doesn't help ... what did you had in mind?
[07:43:37] <elmcrest> actually I would need some dynamic width
[07:43:48] <elmcrest> but 100% f.e. is of course only on initial rendering
[07:45:02] * elmcrest fyi the autoNumeric.js plugin ... which is kind of nice - expect it doesn't work well on contenteditable https://github.com/BobKnothe/autoNumeric
[07:45:43] <BillCriswell> elmcrest: http://jsbin.com/ravibuna/16/edit something like this... sure there's some mathy stuff you can do to get it to work.
[07:47:05] <elmcrest> BillCriswell yes ... that grows really fast :) ...
[07:48:20] <elmcrest> actually the defaults work pretty well... so I guess just converting to a input and back again should do the trick... while adding data on a mobile I could live with minor layout issues
[07:48:43] <elmcrest> at least for the moment :)
[07:49:33] <scri66le> how do I instantiate a jquery function only when the div is visible on the screen?
[07:49:39] <elmcrest> hmm maybe I can "rerender" the page after some input
[07:52:21] <BillCriswell> scri66le: You can check the scrollTop against the offset().top of the element you're running the plugin on then do that once.
[07:52:32] <BillCriswell> Depeding on how complex the plugin is it might not even be worth it.
[07:52:56] <scri66le> it's actually just using animate.css
[07:57:23] <decx> add a class when it's in viewport
[07:57:48] <motaka2> Why in this page, I cant submit the form while
[07:57:48] <motaka2> in insearch.js I have a click evant that in it's last line
[07:57:48] <motaka2> it has form.submit
[07:57:48] <motaka2> http://fa.noondreams.com/hotels/form/departments/web_department/
[08:05:48] <delboy1978uk> So i have this form, but with ajax loadable custom fields! How do I ram a <div> element before my #submit-label element? I tried prepend, but that puts it inside the element at the start.
[08:06:25] <robertmaxrees> did you try http://api.jquery.com/before/ ?
[08:06:36] <NoiseEee> delboy1978uk: there are all sorts of jquery methods to manipulate and position things wherever you like in the DOM.  http://api.jquery.com/category/manipulation/.
[08:06:55] <robertmaxrees> !g jquery insert before
[08:06:59] <delboy1978uk> i just tried before, but i'll read the docs before i ask a stupid question! Thanks NoiseEee
[08:07:00] <b-ot> robertmaxrees: .insertBefore() | jQuery API Documentation → http://api.jquery.com/insertbefore/
[08:07:25] <delboy1978uk> ah! insertBefore() ? awesome i'll try that
[08:07:29] <robertmaxrees> there's also insertbefore, too.
[08:07:35] <robertmaxrees> same thing as before, slightly different syntax
[08:08:23] <delboy1978uk> ah, my syntax was wrong! Thanks guys!
[08:09:19] <delboy1978uk> i had the two the wrong way round! ie. select the element and insertBefore had my div in it lol
[08:10:07] <robertmaxrees> hah
[08:10:09] <robertmaxrees> there you go :)_
[08:10:14] <motaka2> Why in this page, I cant submit the form while
[08:10:14] <motaka2> in insearch.js I have a click evant that in it's last line
[08:10:14] <motaka2> it has form.submit
[08:10:14] <motaka2> http://fa.noondreams.com/hotels/form/departments/web_department/
[08:11:45] <motaka2> robertmaxrees: Are you there?
[08:15:06] <motaka2> no help
[08:15:07] <motaka2> ?
[08:17:18] <robertmaxrees> sorry kind of busy
[08:18:31] <robertmaxrees> if you can set up a simpler example that's no on your site, i might have a minute to look.
[08:18:38] <robertmaxrees> or at least pull the relevant code into a fixee
[08:19:44] <shoky> motaka2: there's an error in console when submitting
[08:28:03] <motaka2> shoky: I have solved the error, but stil nothing happens;
[08:36:28] <Serraphyn> Are there any native jquery time pickers?
[08:37:48] <motaka2> Serraphyn: I found this
[08:38:38] <robertmaxrees> Serraphyn iirc jquery ui has some stuff, but jquery doesn't come pre-baked with anything.
[08:39:33] <Serraphyn> robertmaxrees, I can't really seem to google up an answer on this one way or another
[08:39:41] <robertmaxrees> oh time picker, not date picker.
[08:40:05] <decx> there's a datepicker fork called datetimepicker
[08:40:16] <robertmaxrees> yeah, nothing prebaked for jquery or jquery ui - you'd need to get something separate
[08:40:18] <decx> i think bootstraps datepicker has time in there
[08:41:12] <Serraphyn> decx, when I used input type="time" it didn't do anything with TWBS
[08:41:43] <decx> dont bother with native types for a while
[08:41:54] <decx> polyfill all the things
[08:41:57] <robertmaxrees> ^
[08:42:01] <robertmaxrees> this man is v. smart
[08:42:48] <Serraphyn> polyfill? Sorry I'm just really getting into the Frontend UI of the web world, I been the troll on the backend for most of the 21st Centry
[08:42:53] <Serraphyn> Century even
[08:43:24] <snover> “shim”
[08:43:24] <b-ot> snover: You have 3 new messages, use `read when you wish to read them.
[08:43:25] <decx> polyfill means that you use modern markup and it get's straightened out with a shitload of scripting for older browsers
[08:43:29] <snover> oh my god messages
[08:44:06] <decx> a shim is unifying browserspecific implementations or not
[08:44:32] <decx> like requestanimationframe
[08:44:44] <decx> or was that a shiv
[08:47:17] <robertOnFire> https://github.com/aFarkas/html5shiv
[08:47:26] <robertOnFire> that's the html5 shiv.
[08:47:32] <robertOnFire> you're thinking polyfills and shims
[08:50:30] <decx> i can never distinguish the 3, and when i look it up i forget after a day
[08:50:45] <robertOnFire> if you're using good libs, that's the idea :D
[08:50:52] <decx> ^^
[09:07:54] <doubleem_> is there a way to bypass the ajax prefilter once it's been registered?
[09:11:55] <shoky> motaka2: the problem might be that your submit button has name="submit"
[09:13:02] <shoky> motaka2: yeah pretty sure that's it
[09:13:18] <shoky> thanks idiot browsers
[09:17:22] <shoky> and thanks jquery for ignoring the error in an empty catch {}
[09:18:43] <NoiseEee> why can't I JSON Stringify this without an error? http://jsfiddle.net/dmuoj2tf/
[09:19:13] <NoiseEee> why does JSON.stringify think that "wat" is anything other than an array, as console log'd ?
[09:19:28] <NoiseEee> why is the input still referenced in some way?
[09:19:46] <robertOnFire> it's working fine for me in the native ff console.
[09:19:48] <shoky> NoiseEee: $.fn.map  returns a jquery object
[09:20:00] <robertOnFire> ^that would do it though.
[09:20:07] <NoiseEee> shoky: why isn't that just a good ol' array.prototype.map though?
[09:20:12] <decx> ya, map().get() or something
[09:20:19] <shoky> or $.map
[09:20:23] <decx> right
[09:20:54] <shoky> NoiseEee: cause you can't call jquery methods on an array, i guess
[09:21:28] <NoiseEee> for some reason i thought i was calling https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map
[09:21:39] <shoky> ah
[09:21:55] <shoky> well jquery objects aren't real arrays ;p
[09:22:15] <shoky> and they override .map anyways
[09:22:45] <NoiseEee> but isn't "wat" just a straight-up array?
[09:22:53] <shoky> nope
[09:22:58] <shoky> it's the return value from $.fn.map
[09:23:24] <NoiseEee> shits trippin me up
[09:23:26] <NoiseEee> ok thanks
[09:26:43] <shoky> NoiseEee: it's just that firebug console being confusing and logging the jquery object to look exactly like an array.  dumb
[09:27:18] <NoiseEee> shoky: ah yeah indeed.
[09:30:40] <jakey> data attributes are amazing
[09:31:01] <decx> data properties are even nicer
[09:31:42] <NoiseEee> also triple-y weird shoky is that if i console.log(wat) from the script, i see the jquery object;  if i 'debugger' in the script and just 'wat' in my console, i get a plain-lookin array
[09:32:00] <NoiseEee> shit not cool
[09:32:52] <jakey> what's the difference?
[09:33:51] <robertOnFire> .data() vs .attr()
[09:34:01] <NoiseEee> http://jsfiddle.net/dmuoj2tf/1/
[09:37:30] <shoky> NoiseEee: yeh not cool.. console.dir is always safe at least
[09:43:28] <zyronex> I have a variable called ‘main’ that stores a selector `var main = $(‘selector’);`. Throughout the script, ‘main’ is used to provide context to certain actions happening within the selector. The problem is, when I clone an element from outside of the context, and later try to grab it within the context, it cannot be found, because when ‘main’ was created, it didn’t exist. Is there a way to ensure that when ‘main’ is referenced, it
[09:43:29] <zyronex> refreshes the context based on what’s on the page at that point in time?
[09:44:03] <robertmaxrees> re-run your selector when you're adding/removing stuff.
[09:45:28] <jakey> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11868899/how-can-i-refresh-a-stored-and-snapshotted-jquery-selector-variable
[09:45:32] <zyronex> What I tried to do is something like this: `var main = function() { return $(‘selector’); )}; hoping the script can continue to use main as it has.
[09:46:01] <robertmaxrees> not that easy.
[09:46:10] <robertmaxrees> check out what jakey shared.
[09:46:22] <zyronex> Reading that now.
[09:46:23] <decx> even if that works, you miss out on all the benefits that caching something brings
[09:46:31] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[09:46:36] <robertmaxrees> might want to rething what you're building.
[09:46:39] <robertmaxrees> *rethink
[09:51:15] <jakey> for some reason I though $.map(fn(idx, el)) and [].map(fn(el, idx))
[09:54:31] <zyronex> I think what I’ll do is simply bind to my elements outside of the context so I don’t need access to them within. Then I don’t need to refresh anything and I can still benefit from it being cached.
[09:54:43] <robertmaxrees> bind?
[09:54:55] <robertmaxrees> like, event-wise?
[09:55:14] <robertmaxrees> because that's a great case for event delegation
[09:56:09] <jakey> @robertmaxrees wow I didn't even know that was a thing, thanks
[09:56:27] <jakey> bleh, I can't IRC
[09:56:31] <robertmaxrees> event delegation?
[09:56:37] <jakey> yea
[09:56:48] <robertmaxrees> it's one of my favorite javascript things.
[09:56:53] <robertmaxrees> capture events :)
[09:57:19] <zyronex> Well, the actual problem that caused the whole refresh question was that something was being cloned from outside of the element that I then wanted to then bind to, but I couldn’t find it because ‘main’ didn’t have knowledge of the element that was cloned. I was suggesting that I could simply bind to the stuff I’m cloning before I move it into the element so I wouldn’t need to reference it with ‘main’.
[09:57:33] <robertmaxrees> don't do that.
[09:57:36] <robertmaxrees> use event delegation.
[09:57:50] <zyronex> I’m reading about that now… thanks for the suggestion!
[09:57:54] <robertmaxrees> $main.on('click', 'a', function() {});
[09:57:57] <robertmaxrees> it's baller.
[09:59:52] <SimonP86> can anyone please tell me why e.data is undefined in the following code? http://pastebin.com/390S3BTd
[09:59:57] <zyronex> So, essentially, I bind to something I do have access to that when the cloned item is interacted with, it will be picked up when the event bubbles up.
[10:01:27] <jakey> what does the e object look like?
[10:07:04] <robertmaxrees> zyronex as long as that element is an ancestor of the new element, yep.
[10:08:04] <SimonP86> jakey: what do you mean?  It's type is "message"
[10:08:16] <robertmaxrees> SimonP86 doesn't look like you're including extra data, so there's no e.data to be had.
[10:09:04] <SimonP86> do I need to change the code in this file to include the extra data, or the code in the web worker?
[10:09:23] <robertmaxrees> e.data assumes that you're passing extra data from your event handler.
[10:09:27] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/event.data/
[10:10:07] <robertmaxrees> .on('click', {prop: 'someval'}, function(e) { console.log(e.data.prop) });
[10:10:33] <SimonP86> how do I just access the data sent from the web worker via the postMessage function?
[10:10:33] <robertmaxrees> what sort of data are you trying to pass through?
[10:10:40] <SimonP86> postMessage(e.data[c].toUpperCase());
[10:10:46] <SimonP86> (a char)
[10:11:18] <robertmaxrees> i'd need to see the code for postMEssage
[10:11:40] <SimonP86> I haven't written any code for postMessage
[10:11:45] <robertmaxrees> and actually, you do that via your event binding, not via that function.
[10:11:46] <bkc_> olfox: /wc
[10:14:54] <SimonP86> if I change the code to the following then it works and e.data isn't undefined: http://pastebin.com/HqJEe1Ns
[10:15:25] <robertmaxrees> that's fundamentally different from what you were doing before.
[10:15:44] <SimonP86> I thought both were just adding a handler on the 'message' event?
[10:15:55] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[10:16:02] <robertmaxrees> jquery events are distinct from native events
[10:16:27] <robertmaxrees> e.data() assumes e is a jquery object.
[10:16:27] <robertmaxrees> etc.
[10:17:40] <SimonP86> not following sorry
[10:17:47] <robertmaxrees> what aren't you following?
[10:18:40] <robertmaxrees> worker.onmessage is not the same as $(worker).on('message'
[10:21:34] <SimonP86> I thought that worker.on('message', function(e) { ... }); was just a short-hand for worker.addEventListener('message', function(e) { ... });?  How do the two differ?
[10:21:50] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[10:21:53] <SimonP86> both are triggered at the same time so they must be at least related?
[10:21:58] <robertmaxrees> jquery events are distinct from browser events.
[10:22:06] <robertmaxrees> they're similar but not the same.
[10:22:14] <robertmaxrees> jquery has its own eventing system outside of normal DOM events.
[10:23:17] <jasonmerino> jQuery events are also augmented and contain the browser event, yeah?
[10:23:38] <robertmaxrees> yep.  custom events are a different story though.
[10:24:01] <jasonmerino> Mmmm. Here here.
[10:24:31] <SimonP86> I guess my question is: how do I access the event.data property of the underlying browser event in a jquery event handler then?
[10:25:00] <robertmaxrees> you don't since the event is a custom event (i'm guessing) and there's no event.data to be had :)
[10:25:48] <SimonP86> what do you mean it's a custom event?  To the best of my knowledge I haven't defined any custom events
[10:26:04] <robertmaxrees> but the plugins you're using may be.
[10:27:02] <SimonP86> plugins?  I'm working in a pretty barebones VS project which only includes jQuery and my code
[10:27:12] <robertmaxrees> what's in that webworker file?
[10:27:30] <robertmaxrees> becuase i can't really help without seeing that sucker.  or some documentation
[10:28:02] <SimonP86> http://pastebin.com/W3gY1MQu
[10:28:27] <robertmaxrees> onmessage?
[10:28:34] <robertmaxrees> postMessage?
[10:28:43] <robertmaxrees> sounds like something is throwing custom, non-DOM events.
[10:29:00] <SimonP86> I have no idea what they are, I haven't implemented the postMessage function
[10:29:24] <robertmaxrees> so then what's emmiting the events you're trying to bind to?
[10:29:52] <SimonP86> I presume postMessage is implemented by some 'standard library'?
[10:30:02] <robertmaxrees> never heard of it.
[10:30:17] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window.postMessage interesting
[10:30:26] <robertmaxrees> aaaah yeah okay i vaguely remember thois.
[10:31:16] <robertmaxrees> yes, these would be distinct from jquery events.  if you want to be able to use jquery for these, check this out: http://benalman.com/code/projects/jquery-postmessage/examples/iframe/
[10:32:14] <robertmaxrees> i totally forgot about this thing.
[10:33:28] <mrbubbles> hi guys, I know that you can't make cross-domain ajax requests with jquery... but can you do it with ember.js? I'm assuming so given that it's often used as a lightweight client with a rails api?
[10:34:13] <robertmaxrees> mrbubbles nope.
[10:34:24] <mrbubbles> oh, so just ahve to use jsonp?
[10:34:29] <robertmaxrees> you CAN make cross-domain requests with jQuery
[10:34:32] <robertmaxrees> it's a server config issue.
[10:34:54] <mrbubbles> really?
[10:34:57] <robertmaxrees> yes.
[10:34:59] <mrbubbles> this is just on my local host
[10:35:18] <robertmaxrees> same port, same domain, same protocol?
[10:35:26] <mrbubbles> no it's a different domain
[10:35:36] <mrbubbles> but ultimately the real api is on a different domain too?
[10:35:37] <robertmaxrees> the domain you're trying to pull content from must allow it.
[10:35:38] <SimonP86> robertmaxrees: useful links, thanks
[10:35:51] <robertmaxrees> SimonP86 deffo!  sorry i was confused :)
[10:36:49] <mrbubbles> robertmaxrees: oh, enable CORS?
[10:37:08] <robertmaxrees> mrbubbles the other server needs to, yes, but that can have security implications.
[10:37:34] <mrbubbles> Okay well let me rephrase... in a standard ember.js client rails api scenario, is that the done thing
[10:37:35] <mrbubbles> ?
[10:37:37] <SimonP86> robertmaxrees: no worries, thanks for the assistance, much appreciated
[10:37:45] <robertmaxrees> mrbubbles it doesn't matter how you do the ajax.
[10:38:02] <mrbubbles> okay so I need to enable cors on the rails server
[10:38:08] <robertmaxrees> mrbubbles yes.
[10:38:12] <NoiseEee> mrbubbles: all javacript xhr requests must obey cross-origin policy
[10:38:12] <mrbubbles> cooolio
[10:38:12] <robertmaxrees> the framework is irrelevant
[10:38:21] <robertmaxrees> it's a server configuration issue
[10:38:24] <NoiseEee> s/cross-origin/same-origin/
[10:38:43] <robertmaxrees> make sure you understand the security implications behind enabling it willy-nilly
[10:45:50] <soydemadrid> Hi I've used this popup script here: http://www.slashcoding.com/stylish-popup-with-jquery-for-your-website/ but just wondered if anyone knows how I can call it with onbody load rather than clicking for it?
[10:46:53] <robertmaxrees> run loadPopup(); in the load event?
[10:47:19] <robertmaxrees> $(window).on('load', function() { loadPopup() });
[10:52:58] <soydemadrid> robertmaxrees: hi thanks, do I replace  $("a.popup").click(function() {
[10:52:58] <soydemadrid>  loading(); setTimeout(function(){ loadPopup(); }, 500); return false; });
[10:53:07] <soydemadrid> robertmaxrees: in the .js file?
[10:54:02] <robertmaxrees> Did You Try?™
[10:54:43] <SimonP86>  /away out
[10:55:04] <soydemadrid> robertmaxrees: hi yes but I think I mashed it up. Because there is that setTimeout bit etc. Do you know exactly what I'd need to replace with your code?
[10:56:01] <robertmaxrees> did you use literally what I pasted?
[10:56:14] <soydemadrid> robertmaxrees: yes I just put it in the top of the .js file...
[10:56:23] <robertmaxrees> any console errors?
[10:57:01] <soydemadrid> robertmaxrees: hi the page is here: http://www.staysyork.com/
[10:57:16] <robertmaxrees> works for me...
[10:57:17] <soydemadrid> robertmaxrees: I'd like to remove that text at the top that says click here and just have the popup on first load
[10:57:28] <robertmaxrees> then delete that link from the HTML?
[10:59:09] <soydemadrid> robertmaxrees: ah it was Cloudflare CDN, I purged the cache and now it works! Thank you
[11:01:08] <robertmaxrees> 'kay]
[11:02:02] <zlude> Hello! can i change .hide() animation?
[11:02:47] <zlude> for example, animate({width: 'toggle'}, "fast"); in .hide() ?
[11:03:02] <robertmaxrees> check out the docs: http://api.jquery.com/hide/
[11:08:01] <robertmaxrees> iirc .hide() does height, width, and opacity, then sets to display: none; when you supply that duration.  if that's not what you want, use animate :)
[11:11:50] <zlude> robertmaxrees, but how can i animate "out"?
[11:12:26] <zlude> robertmaxrees, because i need to animate a div hiding
[11:13:15] <decx> when in doubt addClass()
[11:41:01] <Expel> Hello folks, I want to use jQuery to hover over an 'a' tag and I want it to have a border-bottom of 2px solid #fff. What kind of code should I use?
[11:41:14] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[11:42:01] <robertmaxrees> add a class to the anchor and style it that way.
[11:48:57] <Expel> robertmaxrees: Alright, do you mind to print something out on pastebin for me? I'm pretty new to jQuery.
[11:51:26] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[11:51:28] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[11:51:36] <robertmaxrees> which part of that are you not familiar with?
[11:52:25] <motaka2> shoky: are you there?
[11:59:07] <DrWhatshisface> lol… i’m speechless.
[11:59:50] <robertmaxrees> ?
[12:08:08] <jmfurlott> How can I perform some arbitrary function on click of a vimeo html embed?  Nothing seems to be happening on $('iframe').on('click', function() { .. }
[12:08:33] <robertmaxrees> depends on what embed you're using.
[12:08:59] <jmfurlott> robertmaxrees: what do you mean? it just an iframe that gets injected there
[12:09:38] <robertmaxrees> the click doesn't bubble up through there iirc.  check out .contents() if you're trying to bind to something in an iframe.
[12:09:43] <robertmaxrees> though that might be a CORS issue.
[12:10:02] <robertmaxrees> if that doesn't work, see if there isn't an alternative embed you can use that had callbacks.
[12:10:35] <jmfurlott> robertmaxrees: okay, thank you
[12:13:20] <jmfurlott> robertmaxrees: just found this http://developer.vimeo.com/player/js-api
[12:13:57] <robertmaxrees> there you go.
[12:22:17] <zyronex> In the scope of my current element, is there a method to traverse up (parent) and search everything within (find) to see if my target exists? Or do I need both ‘parent’ and ‘find’ to perform my searching manually?
[12:23:16] <robertmaxrees> .closest('parent').find('theThingYouWant')
[12:23:30] <robertmaxrees> there's also http://api.jquery.com/siblings/
[12:24:15] <zyronex> Will it stop once it finds something or will it go all the way up to the root?
[12:24:26] <robertmaxrees> .closest() stops
[12:24:30] <robertmaxrees> .parents() doesn't.
[12:24:39] <zyronex> Got it. Thanks!
[12:24:43] <robertmaxrees> .closest() stops when if finds the first thing that matches your selector.
[12:24:51] <robertmaxrees> there's also .parent(), which goes up a level.
[12:25:40] <zyronex> Right, but I don’t know how far I need to go, so I think closet will meet my needs.
[12:25:45] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[13:20:49] <RhinoBoss> Is it possible to set the value of a select2 by index?
[13:24:09] <robertmaxrees> not that I'm aware of.
[13:24:14] <robertmaxrees> but i don't use select2
[13:24:49] <RhinoBoss> ok thanks
[13:24:54] <Alina-malina> anyone used pace.js before?
[13:25:00] <robertmaxrees> !ask @ Alina-malina
[13:25:00] <b-ot> Alina-malina: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[13:25:20] <Alina-malina> i cant add the progressbar to my div
[13:25:31] <Alina-malina> i dont want it to be in the middle of the page
[13:25:55] <Alina-malina> i want it to be in <div class = "target">my loading bar</div>
[13:26:06] <RhinoBoss> robertmaxrees: Do you know how I could change the select2 list from the code?
[13:26:10] <robertmaxrees> can you setup a fiddle, Alina-malina?
[13:26:16] <Alina-malina> no
[13:26:17] <Alina-malina> :-=/
[13:26:17] <robertmaxrees> RhinoBoss i'd have to trawl through the docs.
[13:26:23] <robertmaxrees> Alina-malina why not?
[13:26:30] <RhinoBoss> ok no need, ill do it
[13:26:33] <Alina-malina> my computer is too slow for that
[13:26:33] <RhinoBoss> thanks
[13:27:10] <Alina-malina> for example: https://github.com/HubSpot/pace/blob/master/pace.coffee  it says that the target:'body' you can setup where it to append, but when i put a class there it still on the middle of the page'
[13:27:44] <robertmaxrees> you probably shouldn;t edit that file.
[13:27:45] <Alina-malina> there is a feeling like an alien wrote the documentation for this
[13:27:56] <Alina-malina> what file?
[13:28:05] <Alina-malina> i did not edit any file
[13:28:08] <robertmaxrees> that coffee file
[13:28:29] <Alina-malina> what?
[13:28:30] <Alina-malina> O_O
[13:28:40] <robertmaxrees> " for example: https://github.com/HubSpot/pace/blob/master/pace.coffee  it says that the target:'body' you can setup where it to append, but when i put a class there it still on the middle of the page'"
[13:28:40] <vicky> hi
[13:28:45] <robertmaxrees> that's why i asked for a fiddle, Alina-malina
[13:29:05] <Alina-malina> i cant use fiddle
[13:29:08] <robertmaxrees> why?
[13:29:12] <Alina-malina> it slows my computer
[13:29:15] <Alina-malina> lagging
[13:29:17] <robertmaxrees> also: http://github.hubspot.com/pace/
[13:29:23] <Alina-malina> what about it?
[13:29:24] <Alina-malina> i know that link
[13:29:27] <robertmaxrees> this should help.
[13:29:31] <Alina-malina> nope
[13:29:33] <Guest79609> guys
[13:29:55] <robertmaxrees> Alina-malina lol you're not giving me anything to work with here.
[13:30:12] <Guest79609> i need a help on this http://codepen.io/anon/pen/nqtcL?editors=001
[13:30:20] <Alina-malina> i dont want fiddle example, i just want to know how to add the progress bar into my div
[13:30:22] <Alina-malina> thats it
[13:30:29] <robertmaxrees> Alina-malina that page i just linked tells you...
[13:30:37] <Alina-malina> show me
[13:30:40] <Alina-malina> i cant see that
[13:31:28] <robertmaxrees> !g pace.js target div
[13:31:34] <b-ot> robertmaxrees: rendering position · Issue #82 · HubSpot/pace · GitHub → https://github.com/HubSpot/pace/issues/82
[13:32:04] <Alina-malina> wtf
[13:32:07] <robertmaxrees> looks like it's mostly controlled by the theme, but you can change that.
[13:32:09] <robertmaxrees> google :)
[13:32:12] <Alina-malina> it is minified code
[13:32:18] <Alina-malina> i am not going to dig into it
[13:32:28] <Alina-malina> google is very poor on this pace
[13:32:40] <robertmaxrees> oh ok.
[13:34:30] <RhinoBoss> robertmaxrees: apparently its just $('#selector').select2('val', idx#);
[13:34:37] <robertmaxrees> RhinoBoss awesome!
[13:35:01] <Alina-malina> robertmaxrees, target:".target",  i change this to my divs name, it still loads in body
[13:35:03] <Alina-malina> i dont know wtf
[13:35:08] <RhinoBoss> robertmaxrees: the more you know. :)
[13:35:08] <robertmaxrees> Alina-malina bummo.
[13:35:15] <robertmaxrees> RhinoBoss i don' tuse sele-
[13:35:18] <robertmaxrees> why do people do that?
[13:35:28] <Alina-malina> bummo?
[13:35:33] <robertmaxrees> *bummer
[13:35:42] <Alina-malina> what are you talking....
[13:35:48] <Alina-malina> >_>
[13:36:16] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[13:47:08] <Alina-malina> pace.js is broken
[13:47:09] <Alina-malina> lol
[13:47:46] <robertmaxrees> then file a bug report.
[13:48:48] <Alina-malina> it is a bug itselft, why to report
[13:49:15] <robertmaxrees> i thought you meant you found a legitimate bug.  sounds like you need to find another library to use or learn this one.
[13:49:32] <robertmaxrees> from what i can see, you need to include the core lib and a theme.
[13:50:14] <Alina-malina> wow
[13:50:16] <Alina-malina> really?
[13:50:27] <robertmaxrees> i guess?  no clue.  this is #jquery, not #pace ;)
[13:52:10] <buzzedword> hey guys, doing the legacy refactor dance again. just hit a silly little selector pattern thats being (ab)used, and it got me wondering if theres a better way to execute it. example here: https://gist.github.com/buzzedword/21b1d217ea02542dd656
[13:52:21] <robertmaxrees> yaaaay those are always fun.
[13:52:27] <buzzedword> top is what's currently there, bottom is what i'm attempting
[13:52:36] <buzzedword> wondering if its just silly overengineering, or actually worthwhile
[13:52:57] <robertmaxrees> first off, have you read the "optimizing selectors" article on the site?
[13:53:00] <buzzedword> yup
[13:53:33] <robertmaxrees> lines 7 and 8 won't do what you think.
[13:53:44] <buzzedword> aha, i was concerned about that
[13:53:46] <robertmaxrees> oh wait yes it will nvm.
[13:53:52] <robertmaxrees> setting works on sets.
[13:53:57] <buzzedword> damn! wait. i mean, woohoo?
[13:54:11] <robertmaxrees> also: var $inviteText = $invite.find("input[type='text'], textarea")
[13:54:16] <robertmaxrees> .find() can take normal css selectors.
[13:54:30] <robertmaxrees> so you just need to separate them by commads.
[13:54:33] <robertmaxrees> *commas
[13:54:55] <buzzedword> my concern here was that sizzle !== CSS
[13:55:03] <robertmaxrees> it is, and then some.
[13:55:15] <robertmaxrees> sizzle is css3+ special stuff.
[13:55:35] <buzzedword> truth. context being though, this is a pattern repeated HUNDREDS of times in the codebase
[13:55:43] <robertmaxrees> doesn't matter?
[13:55:44] <buzzedword> nearly identical structs, but non-repeatable sets
[13:55:59] <buzzedword> right, im just concerned over the selector performance
[13:56:07] <buzzedword> using the find in that fashion is actually alright?
[13:56:21] <robertmaxrees> invoking .add() and the extra call to $invite isn't doing you any favors.
[13:56:24] <buzzedword> fair
[13:56:33] <robertmaxrees> also, input[type='text'] is slow.
[13:56:45] <robertmaxrees> made a little better by limiting your selection, but good to point out.
[13:57:07] <buzzedword> ...oh holy. yeah, i've been staring at this for so long i didn't realize it was using an attribute selector until you pointed it out
[13:57:12] <robertmaxrees> :)
[13:57:32] <buzzedword> okay, awesome. that definitely helps out, thank you
[13:57:51] <robertmaxrees> basically you want var $inviteText = $invite.find(".myClass, textarea");
[13:57:56] <robertmaxrees> get there and you're golden
[13:58:36] <buzzedword> aiming for that. i haven't even touched the HTML side yet. some nasty PHP-SMARTY stuff going on there
[13:58:45] <robertmaxrees> yuck
[13:58:52] <buzzedword> kinda makes me whisper "i'm fullstack" instead of proudly declaring it.
[13:59:00] <robertmaxrees> nah it's all good.
[13:59:14] <robertmaxrees> i do templating and middleware enough to know the pain.
[13:59:24] <robertmaxrees> good middleware isn't sexy and is usually painful.
[13:59:32] <buzzedword> and this is bad middleware.
[13:59:37] <buzzedword> so
[13:59:38] <robertmaxrees> it's all bad.
[13:59:51] <buzzedword> correction: its bad middleware with a terrible implementation.
[14:00:00] <robertmaxrees> haha
[14:00:31] <buzzedword> are you familiar with twig?
[14:00:38] <robertmaxrees> nope
[14:01:12] <buzzedword> its a vastly superior PHP templating engine that mimicks jinja in python
[14:01:14] <buzzedword> but its another one.
[14:01:20] <robertmaxrees> i don't do PHP heh
[14:01:52] <buzzedword> theres a smarty "plugin" in my codebase that brings in the twig templating engine and all of its associated syntax, to render a set of tags that are dynamically generated. and then escapes it into smarty
[14:02:01] <buzzedword> it took me a solid 3 weeks to realize what it was doing
[14:02:08] <robertmaxrees> that sounds a little... awkward.
[14:02:13] <buzzedword> you're too kind.
[14:02:21] <buzzedword> i flipped a table when i found it
[14:02:23] <robertmaxrees> I work in coldfusion so y'know.
[14:02:45] <buzzedword> you have valid XHTML at least... cumbersome, but valid.
[14:02:55] <robertmaxrees> hahahahaha
[14:02:58] <robertmaxrees> barely.
[14:03:02] <robertmaxrees> running away from it.
[14:03:04] <buzzedword> haha
[14:03:11] <robertmaxrees> lots of business logic in the templates.
[14:03:17] <buzzedword> well, you have ben nadel. so you're fine.
[14:03:22] <robertmaxrees> hahahaha.
[14:03:41] <robertmaxrees> right?!  and cfscript is almost javascript, so there's that.  we're moving to node.js as soon as we can.
[14:03:59] <jasonmerino> node.js++
[14:04:05] <robertmaxrees> hi jasonmerino :)
[14:04:09] <jasonmerino> Hey!
[14:04:35] <jasonmerino> You're quite helpful in here! Keep up the good work. :)
[14:04:38] <robertmaxrees> :D
[14:04:51] <buzzedword> alright. im going to get back to bleeding my eyes-- i mean refactoring
[14:04:53] <robertmaxrees> hey they didn't give me mod for nothin'.
[14:04:53] <buzzedword> thanks again!
[14:04:57] <robertmaxrees> enjoy buzzedword
[14:05:08] <jasonmerino> :)
[14:08:21] <hpekdemir> hi all
[14:09:16] <hpekdemir> I have this function http://nopaste.info/23e9f79c53.html
[14:09:36] <hpekdemir> how can I return only true when all of the fields with class "serial" have a value and are NOT empty?
[14:09:54] <hpekdemir> since this function in this nopaste would return on each single serial field.
[14:10:13] <hpekdemir> I want it to pass all fields and then return true. else false if even ONE of them is empty.
[14:11:02] <robertmaxrees> you could .filter()
[14:11:19] <robertmaxrees> and then check the resulting set.
[14:12:56] <hpekdemir> ok thanks
[14:22:45] <Nomikos> what's a good way to move an item to the front of the list it's in?
[14:23:07] <Nomikos> like click on an <li> and it moves to the top
[14:23:55] <robertmaxrees> change its index
[14:24:05] <robertmaxrees> rather, insertBefore() the first li
[14:24:21] <Nomikos> hm, prepend() might do it
[14:24:57] <robertmaxrees> just $(this).inserBefore('li').first() or whatever
[14:26:49] <Nomikos> .prependTo(_this.parent()) works
[15:28:11] <qqqwertyyy> Is there a way for me to write a plugin that disables the html() function in jquery?
[15:28:33] <qqqwertyyy> I tried changing $.fn.html but I think internal code uses it too
[15:29:57] <robertmaxrees> that's a strange thing to want to do.
[15:30:04] <robertmaxrees> mind explaining what you're actually trying to do?
[15:30:54] <qqqwertyyy> well, my concern is that my app has lots of DOMXSS
[15:31:01] <qqqwertyyy> or could have
[15:31:26] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[15:31:30] <robertmaxrees> mind illustrating?
[15:31:34] <qqqwertyyy> due to the use of html calls directly
[15:31:44] <robertmaxrees> could you please clarify?
[15:31:58] <qqqwertyyy> yeah, sorry .. 1 sec. let me see if I can pull something up
[15:32:33] <qqqwertyyy> https://code.google.com/p/domxsswiki/wiki/jQuery
[15:33:10] <robertmaxrees> .html() by itself is not an attack vecotr.
[15:33:17] <robertmaxrees> I think you're confused about the issue.
[15:33:34] <robertmaxrees> do you have any places users can enter text onto the page?
[15:33:41] <qqqwertyyy> yeah
[15:33:46] <robertmaxrees> okay - sanitize that.
[15:33:55] <robertmaxrees> and properly escape it.
[15:34:23] <qqqwertyyy> yeah, in an ideal world, input validation or sanitization could work. HTML is kinda tricky to sanitize/validate at input times
[15:34:32] <robertmaxrees> sure, but that's your best bet.
[15:34:38] <qqqwertyyy> since how to sanitize a string often depends on the context in which it is printed
[15:34:49] <robertmaxrees> sure - so handle that in your backend.
[15:35:03] <robertmaxrees> disabling features in jquery isn't a very good way to approach that.
[15:35:16] <qqqwertyyy> sure thing.. it is a terrible way to approach it
[15:35:25] <qqqwertyyy> something like content security policy is much better
[15:36:06] <robertmaxrees> sanitize properly, never allow raw HTML unless you can confidently restrict it to a specific subset, etc.
[15:36:13] <qqqwertyyy> ok .. let me rephrase the question then: how do I force developers to use the element/tree construction methods instead of using functions that accept arbitrary html strings?
[15:36:35] <robertmaxrees> depends on the case.
[15:36:58] <qqqwertyyy> case?
[15:37:15] <robertmaxrees> i mean, you can't really force it.
[15:37:17] <robertmaxrees> sooo...
[15:37:20] <robertmaxrees> depends on the case.
[15:38:02] <qqqwertyyy> I am wondering if there is any case in which I can do something about this
[15:38:33] <robertmaxrees> for context - are you a manager of a dev team?  how did this issue come up?
[15:38:50] <qqqwertyyy> lol .. naah just some security person, messing around with jquery
[15:39:00] <robertmaxrees> this is why you have code review policies./
[15:39:06] <robertmaxrees> and a style guide
[15:39:16] <robertmaxrees> and pre-commit hooks if you want to be really cool.
[15:39:19] <robertmaxrees> and code analysis tools
[15:40:02] <qqqwertyyy> aah yeah .. the problem is I am not sure I can trust code analysis of JavaScript code
[15:40:11] <robertmaxrees> which is why you have code review.
[15:40:21] <robertmaxrees> and sanitization.
[15:40:39] <robertmaxrees> just because you remove features/disable them in jquery doesn't mean a developer won't re-write them and otherwise work around that ;)
[15:40:48] <qqqwertyyy> yeah
[15:41:07] <robertmaxrees> Trust me - I know it's a pain.  we have to comply with PCI standards, so I get the feeling.
[15:52:14] <marcu_s> Hi there, I'm using $(this.content).find('img, a[href$=".jpg"], a[href$=".jpeg"], a[href$=".JPEG"], a[href$=".png"], a[href$=".pdf"], a[href$=".PDF"]').each(function() { ... }); It's been working great for a long time. this.content, is HTML. For some reasons this string: "Packaged in lots of 10 sets <img class="alignnone size-full" src="http://www.integra-adhesives.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Sink_Fastener.jpg" alt="" width="300" 
[15:52:29] <marcu_s> is throwing the error: "Uncaught Error: Syntax error, unrecognized expression: Packaged in lots of 10 sets <img class="alignnone size-full" src="http://www.integra-adhesives.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Sink_Fastener.jpg" alt="" width="300" /> " And I can't figure out why!
[15:59:42] <asturel> hi, i have a form which have a <form method="post"><input type="image" value="submit"> </post> and the .submit doesnt work on it
[16:00:55] <asturel> i tried $('form').submit(function (event) { event.preventDefault(); return false; }); but it doesnt works
[16:00:58] <marcu_s> .submit is looking for a class, you would need to add class="submit" to your submit button to make it work.
[16:03:06] <asturel> class? not name?
[16:06:27] <asturel> but why im not able to cancel the event with $('input[type="image"]').click(function (event) { ?
[16:07:14] <asturel> hmm..
[16:13:10] <robertWorkBeer> do what now?
[16:13:10] <robertWorkBeer> you can.
[16:13:23] <robertWorkBeer> as long as that selector is valid
[16:16:18] <robertWorkBeer> asturel $('form').submit(function (event) { event.preventDefault(); return false; }); should work.
[16:16:25] <robertWorkBeer> don't return false out of that though.
[16:16:37] <robertWorkBeer> the preventDefault method should be enough
[16:16:43] <jeffreylevesque> how do i retrieve data from php using ajax?
[16:17:09] <robertWorkBeer> jeffreylevesque by hitting a url that returns the data you want.
[16:17:16] <jeffreylevesque> i was thinking of putting it within $.ajax({ // code }).done( //here);
[16:17:30] <robertWorkBeer> yep.
[16:17:55] <robertWorkBeer> $.ajax('someUrl.php').done(function(data) { console.log(data) });
[16:20:15] <jeffreylevesque> the suggested '.done(function(data) { console.log(data); }' produces an error
[16:20:28] <robertWorkBeer> paste up your code?
[16:21:10] <jeffreylevesque> robertWorkBeer: this is my current committed code - https://github.com/jeff1evesque/machine-learning/blob/79deb5acc245aca26f127e765afc94fffd32700a/src/js/html_form_ajax.js
[16:21:30] <asturel> yeah it works, sorry, i thought my js loads after the dom is done
[16:21:30] <robertWorkBeer> you already have a done.
[16:21:37] <robertWorkBeer> jeffreylevesque so put it in there.
[16:22:11] <sangeight> hi guys, need some advice.
[16:22:16] <sangeight> I am trying to create a minimap for an application based on Meteor. After researching a bit, I felt like I would need to build my own. I stumbled upon a library which has the features but is not quite flexible enough for what I want to implement. I basically want to use some of the techniques that the library uses. What would be the best way of extending it or re-using the techniques but at the same time give credits t
[16:22:16] <sangeight> the library?
[16:22:24] <jeffreylevesque> robertWorkBeer: i did (not committed), and it produces the following message in console - Error: logic_loader.php, logic_loader()
[16:22:26] <asturel> can i somehow differente when user click on submit and when i call submit via jquery?
[16:22:42] <robertWorkBeer> jeffreylevesque i'd need to see that code then.
[16:22:50] <robertWorkBeer> asturel sure - small google search.
[16:23:00] <robertWorkBeer> sangeight not the right place to ask.
[16:23:36] <jeffreylevesque> robertWorkBeer: https://github.com/jeff1evesque/machine-learning/blob/79deb5acc245aca26f127e765afc94fffd32700a/php/logic_loader.php#L33
[16:23:54] <robertWorkBeer> wat
[16:24:01] <jeffreylevesque> haha
[16:24:01] <robertWorkBeer> jeffreylevesque you can't call php from javascript.
[16:24:18] <sangeight> robertWorkBeer: thanks. where would be a right place to ask?
[16:24:26] <robertWorkBeer> sangeight a room about meteor?
[16:25:14] <sangeight> robertWorkBeer: ah! sorry for the confusion. the app is built on Meteor. but the plugin i want to use/write is with jQuery.
[16:26:29] <robertWorkBeer> sangeight still not a great place to ask, but I'd start by looking at their license
[16:26:40] <robertWorkBeer> see if you can for and, if so, how you show attribute your changes.
[16:26:46] <robertWorkBeer> OR find a plugin that actually does what you need.
[16:30:35] <sangeight> robertWorkBeer: thanks. They do state that it is free to be used, modified and distributed. It is just that. I would have to write a whole library myself but using some of their techniques. I guess, I will just make a fresh library and credit them appropriately. Thanks again
[16:30:52] <robertWorkBeer> what plugin is it?
[16:30:59] <robertWorkBeer> and what are you trying to use it for?
[16:31:28] <sangeight> https://github.com/goldenapples/jquery.minimap
[16:31:37] <sangeight> that’s the library
[16:31:45] <robertWorkBeer> *plugin ;)
[16:31:54] <robertWorkBeer> what what doesn't it do for you?
[16:32:02] <sangeight> ah .. sorry. plugin
[16:32:08] <lucavgobbi> ?
[16:32:30] <sangeight> ah .. so I need more control over the size of the minimap and where it is displayed
[16:32:47] <robertWorkBeer> css?
[16:32:56] <jeffreylevesque> i am dynamically creating my form elements using .on().  Perhaps the scoping is off.  But, how can I check my POST array in jquery before I send it to my 'action' php script?
[16:33:14] <robertWorkBeer> beforesend.
[16:33:26] <robertWorkBeer> or modify all of your bindings.
[16:33:27] <jeffreylevesque> how do i properly print it using console.log()?
[16:33:41] <robertWorkBeer> the same way you would anywhere else?
[16:33:59] <jeffreylevesque> i want to print the entire array, so i can see each field value in console
[16:34:00] <robertWorkBeer> oh wait you're not using ajax are you?
[16:34:06] <jeffreylevesque> i am
[16:34:10] <robertWorkBeer> then yeah, beforesend.
[16:34:37] <robertWorkBeer> you should check out learn.jquery.com btw
[16:35:29] <sangeight> robertWorkBeer, have an interface where users can add several items (images, text, maps, timelines), drag them, group them and have connections between them.  So i need a minimap to show these, but I also want the items to be represented with appropriate icons.
[16:35:44] <robertWorkBeer> sangeight okay
[16:35:54] <robertWorkBeer> i'd create an overlay or something for those, but meh
[16:38:22] <sangeight> robertWorkBeer: hmm. would the cause a few performance issue?
[16:38:28] <sangeight> that*
[16:38:54] <robertWorkBeer> it shouldn't.
[16:39:50] <sarnold> what's the proper way to report security issues to jquery devs?
[16:40:39] <sangeight> robertWorkBeer: great! thanks for the help robert!
[16:41:57] <robertWorkBeer> sarnold #jquery-dev
[16:42:02] <sarnold> thanks robertWorkBeer
[16:43:22] <robertWorkBeer> sarnold there's also a bug tracker.
[16:43:28] <robertWorkBeer> what's the issue, btw?
[16:43:53] <sarnold> robertWorkBeer: looks like an xss, and on further inspection perhaps only for an old version
[16:44:04] <robertWorkBeer> could you provide some detail?
[16:44:56] <robertWorkBeer> because though sounds like an issue with a server, not jquery
[16:46:01] <sarnold> robertWorkBeer: not easily :) someone sent an email to MITRE's CVE requesting a number, MITRE suggested they mail distros@, and it seems unlikely any of us will know what to do with it, so I just want to find a nice place to redirect the reporter or find some place to copy-paste his email
[16:46:20] <robertWorkBeer> wat
[16:46:44] <robertWorkBeer> that... doesn't make any sense to me.
[16:47:40] <sarnold> robertWorkBeer: humm. I had just skimmed this email quickly, not bothering to understand it, but it looks like the reporter may understand these things less than I do :) hah
[16:48:12] <robertWorkBeer> jquery the library would not be an issue with XSS afaik, unless they found something really crazy.
[16:48:39] <robertWorkBeer> if you want to submit a report or whatever, check out the bug tracker.
[16:50:48] <jeffreylevesque> robertWorkBeer: I am able to return 'data'.  But, how can I parse the object to return only the POST data in 'beforeSend'?
[16:51:29] <jeffreylevesque> or is there an alternative object i can print in console.log?
[16:52:04] <robertWorkBeer> err, i think you're confused about how all of this hooks together.
[16:52:32] <robertWorkBeer> that doesn't get magically shipped to beforeSend.
[16:52:46] <jeffreylevesque> i just want to make all the data exists before being sent
[16:52:54] <jeffreylevesque> because my form is created dynamically
[16:53:03] <robertWorkBeer> cool - check out http://api.jquery.com/jquery.ajax/ for mor einfo.
[16:53:05] <jeffreylevesque> i want to make sure the submit button knows about the POST data
[16:53:11] <robertWorkBeer> you can look at the jqXHR object, as well.
[16:53:49] <jeffreylevesque> my form is essentially a bunch of nested .on() methods.  and the submit is the last one nested in
[16:53:54] <blackkbot> javascript is sync unless otherwise specified so if you put it in one function and at the end tell it to submit it should have all the info
[16:53:58] <robertWorkBeer> that's not a good idea, jeffreylevesque
[16:54:06] <robertWorkBeer> nesting .on() is a bad ide.a
[16:54:32] <robertWorkBeer> can you share an example of what you're doing in a fiddle?  it's fine if the ajax portion doesn't work.
[16:55:09] <jeffreylevesque> robertWorkBeer: https://github.com/jeff1evesque/machine-learning/blob/79deb5acc245aca26f127e765afc94fffd32700a/src/js/html_form.js
[16:55:27] <robertWorkBeer> :(
[16:55:33] <sarnold> robertWorkBeer: thanks, now that I've actually -read- the guy's mail, it doesn't make a whole lot of sense.
[16:55:39] <robertWorkBeer> sarnold of course :)
[16:55:48] <sarnold> robertWorkBeer: cheers and enjoy that beer :)
[16:55:48] <robertWorkBeer> jeffreylevesque this is a really bad way to do this.
[16:56:04] <jeffreylevesque> the form works
[16:56:14] <jeffreylevesque> the generation of, that is
[16:56:22] <robertWorkBeer> "it works" is one of the worst reasingings to keep doing something, but okay.
[16:56:27] <robertWorkBeer> can you setup a simplified exmaple please?
[16:56:50] <blackkbot> lol robertWorkBeer idk it seems like one of the best reasons to keep doing something
[16:56:57] <robertWorkBeer> haha
[16:57:06] <robertWorkBeer> just because something works does not mean it's a good idea.
[16:57:07] <blackkbot> if something works why change it
[16:57:10] <jeffreylevesque> robertWorkBeer: how can i print out the POST data when I press submit?
[16:57:21] <robertWorkBeer> jeffreylevesque check out the docs.  tons of ways to do that.
[16:57:35] <robertWorkBeer> blackkbot there are clean ways to do things.
[16:57:39] <robertWorkBeer> more efficient ways to do things.
[16:57:41] <jeffreylevesque> i want to print all the POST data before it is sent to the php
[16:57:43] <jeffreylevesque> ok
[16:57:48] <blackkbot> like my car started... should i start messing with the wiring? but yeah i know what you are saying
[16:58:00] <robertWorkBeer> blackkbot but you did not build the car.
[16:58:15] <robertWorkBeer> for instance, in the gist that was posted, it repeats the same things over and over.
[16:58:28] <blackkbot> oh yeah thats silly
[16:59:06] <robertWorkBeer> cache $(this) into $this and create a single object that holds the fieldset, then change the relegant bits, instead of storing all that text and repeating yourself.
[16:59:17] <blackkbot> if you do something more than 2 or 3 times its worth putting in a function
[16:59:28] <robertWorkBeer> more than once
[16:59:48] <robertWorkBeer> my rule is more than once, and even if it's only once i'll probably abstract it.
[17:00:13] <blackkbot> yeah i do the same thing just because it makes more sense to me that way but its not really needed
[17:00:22] <robertWorkBeer> i'd argue.
[17:00:36] <robertWorkBeer> imo separating it out makes you clean up your logic.
[17:00:43] <robertWorkBeer> and have clear separations of concern.
[17:01:14] <blackkbot> right and allows for quick modifications and testing
[17:01:28] <robertWorkBeer> i'm working on a project that exemplifies that.  it replicates some things done elsewhere in the codebase, but does it in a fraction of the time and space.
[17:01:40] <robertWorkBeer> because i stuck to an almost overly functional pattern.
[17:02:44] <blackkbot> are you referring to jquery as a whole? because thats how i feel about a lot of jquery stuff
[17:03:26] <robertWorkBeer> about javascript as a whle.
[17:03:28] <robertWorkBeer> *whole
[17:03:45] <jeffreylevesque> I am going to take a break, and return to this later.  i am really excited to learn ajax
[17:03:51] <jeffreylevesque> some cool stuff, here
[17:04:25] <blackkbot> right on ajax is very fun until its work
[17:04:52] <robertWorkBeer> it's pretty easy tbh
[17:05:55] <blackkbot> yeah easy things that seem hard to people who don't know how to do it are fun
[17:06:48] <robertWorkBeer> nah, you just have to get that first basic bit of deferreds and "async" grokked.
[17:47:15] <sdwrage> if I add the rel="publisher" attribute via jquery to an a link, will it still work correctly?
[18:08:29] <argoneus> hello
[18:08:34] <argoneus> can I get assistance with userscripts here or not really?
[18:09:05] <shoky> you can try
[18:10:52] <argoneus> so it's not against the rules?
[18:11:42] <shoky> it's fine
[18:12:16] <shoky> just don't be annoying :D
[18:12:36] <argoneus> heh, okay :D
[18:13:34] <shoky> tho i see you're asking on #javascript too, might be more appropriate there anyway
[18:13:53] <shoky> i'll chime in there if i can help ;p
[19:29:33] <skypce> hello guys,
[19:29:37] <skypce> i need help with this
[19:29:37] <skypce> http://pastebin.com/skjPpAg6
[19:30:27] <skypce> i need when #formulario-contacto is in viewport , add overflow auto to body tag
[19:30:52] <skypce> i pay fixing some css issue :)
[20:32:56] <skypce> hello
[21:12:05] <farakow> whats wrong with line 6 here? http://pastebin.com/hQ6uvmcf
[21:33:19] <systemfault> lindii_: The only thing that isn't good is the order
[21:33:56] <systemfault> The order of the "if"s
[22:27:03] <Admin_> hello
[22:27:20] <Expel> Admin_: Hello.
[22:27:59] <Admin_> can someone help me understand why this isnt working http://pastebin.com/3jsfGE36
[22:28:24] <Admin_> by working i mean the a on click is not firing
[22:31:46] <Admin_> oh maybe it is a restriction of google
[22:36:05] <ome> Is jQuery's ajaxComplete same as XHR.onload?
[22:44:20] <ussher_> first issue is "ReferenceError: google is not defined"
[22:44:35] <ussher_> ^^ for Admin_
[22:45:20] <Admin_> yah thats not the issue
[22:45:32] <Admin_> i thin i need to use $(document).on() instead of $('a).on
[22:45:38] <Admin_> but how do i still select the a tag that way
[22:45:58] <Admin_> $(document).on('click','a',function()?
[22:45:59] <Admin_> ill try that
[22:47:01] <Admin_> that did the trick
[22:48:53] <Expel> Admin_: I think you have to do it in your function() { $('a')... }
[22:49:48] <Admin_> no the problem is google dynamically generates all the elements
[22:50:02] <Admin_> so you have to use $(document).on() with google apps scripts :)
[22:51:01] <Expel> Admin_: Oh, alright.
[23:25:31] <ome> Is it possible to access the XMLHttpRequest from jQuery.ajax?
[23:26:32] <ome> XMLHttpRequest's events?

[23:59:04] <hooligan321> a div element that i had setup to expand to 100% height suddenly stopped working i had to edit the css to make it position: absolute; to make it work again and I am sure its because twitter is screwing up with jqm included I'll test this and report back ... but twitter is starting to get on my tits like 1 in 10 loads ... twitters wigets script or there cdn have problems any way ...and about 1
[23:59:04] <hooligan321> in 20 loads soundclouds api has problems and thats not even from a cdn
