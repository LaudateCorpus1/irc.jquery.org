[00:52:37] <Saint_Is_> can someone explain to me what this is doing exactly: window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="js/jquery-2.1.0.min.js"
[00:54:57] <systemfault> Saint_Is_: Checks if the window object contains a jQuery key... and if not, writes the script tag so it fetches it locally.
[00:55:27] <Saint_Is_> systemfault thank you very much
[00:55:28] <systemfault> Basically, it's a fallback in the improbable case that the CDN would be down.
[00:57:51] <Saint_Is_> I having an issue, that I could really use some guidance on. I'm working integrating someone else php script that has a lot of js dependecies. currently my issue is when I submit a particular for I get Gif loader but it does not seem to submit to the page that needs to handle the form
[00:58:16] <Saint_Is_> I suspect some jquery is stopping it but I can't seem to find the script that could be doing that

[07:11:14] <xenaxon> hi all
[07:11:27] <xenaxon> I tried making a close button on an accordion
[07:11:37] <xenaxon> to remove the accordion from the dom
[07:11:50] <xenaxon> but when I click the button, the click action doesn't fire....
[07:12:41] <xenaxon> it seems like it triggers the handle to collapse/expand it instead of the actual close button
[07:33:48] <momomo> why does document.querySelectorAll("#searchresults > #searchresults_table") and document.querySelectorAll("#searchresults > #searchresults_table > div")  return the same element?
[07:58:46] <xenaxon> what is the best plugin for working with cookies?
[08:15:33] <PSUser2> can someone help me with this one? http://jsfiddle.net/hr9bymj1/34/
[08:15:46] <PSUser2> i want to overlay a small image on top of the thumbnail, when clicking the thumbnail
[08:24:16] <xenaxon> hi
[08:24:22] <xenaxon> guys, small problem with accordion
[08:24:38] <xenaxon> when I remove an accordion from the dom, the other accordions no longer expand
[08:28:03] <Sendoushi> xenaxon: is it erroring? are you using strict mode?
[08:28:18] <Sendoushi> maybe you should .each().accordion()
[08:29:19] <xenaxon> jquery-2.2.3.min.js:2 Uncaught Error: cannot call methods on accordion prior to initialization; attempted to call method 'option'
[08:29:40] <xenaxon> i was thinking of that, but isn't that what it does anyway?
[08:30:22] <Sendoushi> i don't know what it does underneath it but...
[08:30:39] <Sendoushi> but it seems you already have an error so you should fix it
[08:30:54] <Sendoushi> i actually don't know what they mean by "prior to initialization" though
[08:30:58] <Terens1> d
[08:31:03] <Terens1> hello
[08:31:03] <Sendoushi> maybe it isnt document ready or something i dunno
[08:31:06] <Terens1> i have some code where they use
[08:31:08] <Terens1> if $("#blah").is('*') what does it do?
[08:31:14] <Terens1> check existence?
[08:31:35] <xenaxon> Sendoushi: I create multiple accordions dinamycally
[08:31:45] <Sendoushi> Terens1: have you tried it? i think that if it works... it will always be true
[08:31:54] <xenaxon> Sendoushi: and when I remove one from the dom, the others get uninitialised for some reaso
[08:32:04] <xenaxon> Sendoushi: it's like they are chained together
[08:32:05] <Sendoushi> xenaxon: try to each and accordion inside
[08:32:35] <xenaxon> Sendoushi: https://jsfiddle.net/tnLrn0u5/
[08:32:41] <Sendoushi> a sec...
[08:33:03] <xenaxon> Sendoushi: look at the code I use. how can I make it for (this), so that I don't have to remake it for all each time a new one is added
[08:33:06] <Sendoushi> domnodeinserted? weird...
[08:33:14] <xenaxon> yes. I am inserting them
[08:33:18] <xenaxon> dinamically
[08:33:25] <Sendoushi> anyway... this is kind of weird...
[08:33:32] <Sendoushi> what is formComponent? is something inside elDropper?
[08:33:38] <xenaxon> yes
[08:33:51] <xenaxon> it is, because I'm not doing something simple
[08:34:10] <Sendoushi> so if it is inside
[08:34:13] <Sendoushi> you should .find()
[08:34:21] <Sendoushi> first of all: better for dom performance
[08:34:26] <xenaxon> find what?
[08:34:32] <Sendoushi> second of all: you are not reinstantiating everything a gain
[08:34:34] <Sendoushi> again
[08:34:37] <xenaxon> this has to be done on insert,
[08:34:37] <Sendoushi> a sec....
[08:34:52] <Sendoushi> sure sure that is not what i'm talking about
[08:35:05] <Sendoushi> let me see how domnodeinserted works
[08:35:08] <Sendoushi> never used it before ehehe
[08:35:10] <xenaxon> this has to be done on dome insert
[08:35:13] <xenaxon> that's not the problem
[08:35:36] <xenaxon> the problem is instantiating the accordion on only the one currently inserted in the dom, not the existing ones as well
[08:35:43] <Sendoushi> here is a great example for you xenaxon https://jsfiddle.net/Xeoncross/K2LRL/
[08:35:46] <xenaxon> this is what I think is causing the problem. maybe they are linked?
[08:35:52] <Sendoushi> see what he does with e.target element?
[08:36:21] <Sendoushi> the problem with your code is that when you do $('.formComponent') is getting alll of the elements in the page
[08:36:29] <Sendoushi> you just want the inserted
[08:36:32] <xenaxon> Sendoushi: that's what I am already doing, just that mine is more complex
[08:36:40] <Sendoushi> no you're not
[08:36:41] <Sendoushi> :|
[08:36:53] <xenaxon> maybe you sent me wrong link?
[08:36:55] <xenaxon> 1sec
[08:37:04] <Sendoushi> once again... when you do $('.formComponent') you're instantiating all of the page
[08:37:20] <xenaxon> yeah but what did you show me
[08:37:24] <Sendoushi> besides being wrong to do that, it will recreate accordions on all
[08:37:26] <xenaxon> it's not doing anything
[08:37:29] <xenaxon> besides append
[08:37:35] <Sendoushi> sigh... a sec!
[08:37:49] <xenaxon> which I already have done in another function
[08:38:05] <Sendoushi> i dont actually know how this works but i would do like this...
[08:38:17] <Sendoushi> https://jsfiddle.net/tnLrn0u5/1/
[08:38:25] <Sendoushi> i dont know if e.target is elDropper or formComponent
[08:38:25] <xenaxon> my question is, how do I select the dominserted element
[08:38:31] <xenaxon> something like $(this)
[08:38:38] <xenaxon> in the dom insert event function
[08:38:49] <Sendoushi> from what i understood of that fiddle code... you do it the way i've just showed you
[08:39:01] <xenaxon> ok let me check
[08:39:21] <Sendoushi> but a sec i'll try here something...
[08:40:13] <xenaxon> ok. this did the trick
[08:40:24] <xenaxon> but now there's another problem
[08:40:32] <Sendoushi> give me time please...
[08:40:56] <xenaxon> the way I set it up before, when I opened an accordion, the others were closing
[08:41:00] <xenaxon> but now, they don't
[08:41:06] <xenaxon> they remain in the current state
[08:41:38] <Sendoushi> xenaxon: then you're on the right path :P
[08:41:56] <Sendoushi> is there a class accordion has when it is open?
[08:42:11] <Sendoushi> before accordion happen you close all
[08:42:15] <Sendoushi> and open the one you want
[08:42:36] <Sendoushi> it also depends on the lib you're using for the accordion. i do my own so...
[08:43:08] <Sendoushi> you even have there "beforeActivate" function
[08:43:34] <Sendoushi> aaah now i understand you were already doing this look at your beforeActivate function
[08:43:45] <xenaxon> well, I was selecting them
[08:43:51] <xenaxon> and giving the a function that closed it
[08:43:53] <xenaxon> check my fiddle
[08:44:07] <xenaxon> but now I modified it to do the same thing
[08:44:16] <Sendoushi> give me the link again
[08:44:26] <xenaxon> but it works only for the ones created before the one you are activating/deactivating
[08:44:36] <xenaxon> so I can open them all at the same time if i start from the last
[08:44:37] <xenaxon> :))
[08:44:51] <xenaxon> but if I start from the first, it closes the ones before it
[08:45:45] <Sendoushi> on that instance you can $('.formComponent').not(this) and close it
[08:45:55] <Sendoushi> or whatever...
[08:48:16] <xenaxon> on what event?
[08:48:29] <xenaxon> doesnt work like that.
[08:48:40] <xenaxon> because you need to know if it's active or inactive (open or close)
[08:49:28] <xenaxon> or...
[08:49:37] <xenaxon> this is bind bending, or I'm just confused
[08:49:38] <xenaxon> :))
[08:49:49] <xenaxon> let me check
[08:59:04] <xenaxon> but what's the method to close the accordion
[08:59:10] <xenaxon> hang on, gotta check the docs
[09:04:36] <xenaxon> $('.formComponent').accordion("activate", false);
[09:04:40] <xenaxon> tried this but doesnt work
[09:04:46] <xenaxon> i think ill have to leave it at it
[10:14:37] <xenaxon> hi
[10:15:07] <xenaxon> what's the best way of saving html templates for appending them in the dom when needed?
[10:15:36] <xenaxon> I need at least 10 templates that need to be inserted upon specific buttons being pressed
[10:16:09] <xenaxon> I tried just placing the code inside append(in-here)
[10:16:26] <xenaxon> but seems like too much of a hassle with all the new line characters and so on
[10:16:57] <xenaxon> so now I'm thinking of just creating the templates and giving them a class to identify them
[10:17:10] <xenaxon> and hiding them in body by just using display:none;
[10:17:17] <xenaxon> and when I need them, I'll just clone them
[10:17:20] <xenaxon> is this a good practice?
[11:13:43] <ales> hi..

[16:55:45] <Neobenedict_> yo guys, is there a way to adapt this so it removes things that DO NOT contain "B": $("#mytable tr td:contains('B')").remove();
[16:58:04] <arc_> Neobenedict_ $("#mytable tr :not(td:contains('B'))").remove();
[16:59:31] <shoky> td:not(:contains('B'))  would be better probably
[16:59:44] <arc_> why is that
[17:00:22] <shoky> yours would find any element in the table that doesn't contain B. including elements inside a <td> that contains B
[17:00:39] <shoky> and nested elements..
[17:00:48] <Neobenedict_> hmm, this isn't doing what I want
[17:00:57] <arc_> i see
[17:00:59] <Neobenedict_> i have a table with lots of <tr>s, with lots of <td>s inside that
[17:01:07] <Neobenedict_> i want to remove the <tr> if none of the tds inside contain "B"
[17:01:15] <arc_> yeah that's different
[17:01:36] <Neobenedict_> b being the example since i'm copy pasting things from stack exchange which don't work as I want them to :(
[17:01:54] <arc_> you can just do like
[17:02:22] <arc_> $("#mytable tr td:not(:contains('B'))").closest('tr').remove();
[17:02:40] <arc_> there may be a way to modify the css to do it instead of using a jquery method but i'm not that well versed in css
[17:03:00] <Neobenedict_> i'm scraping data from a page so no need to preserve anything :P
[17:03:10] <Neobenedict_> thought easiest way is just remove all the rows i don't want first.
[17:04:08] <Neobenedict_> that is removing every row.
[17:04:11] <shoky> $('#mytable tr:not(:contains(B))')
[17:04:15] <shoky> .remove()
[17:04:16] <Neobenedict_> the B is inside a <font> and <a> tag
[17:04:18] <Neobenedict_> does that matter?
[17:04:25] <Neobenedict_> so <td> -> <a> -> <font>
[17:05:38] <arc_> font tag : (
[17:05:47] <Neobenedict_> not my decision :P
[17:05:50] <arc_> i know
[17:05:52] <Neobenedict_> but yeah tell me about it
[17:05:52] <Neobenedict_> lol
[17:06:09] <arc_> well according to what shoky said before, the thing he just wrote should work regardless of that
[17:06:16] <Neobenedict_> and the attributes inside the a vary so can;'t just do contains("<a>..")
[17:06:27] <Neobenedict_> let me try
[17:06:40] <mooncup> woah
[17:06:47] <Neobenedict_> hello mooncup
[17:06:51] <mooncup> sup
[17:06:55] <Neobenedict_> nm
[17:07:11] <mooncup> always weird when you see someone unexpected in an irc channel
[17:08:19] <Neobenedict_> that works, thanks
[17:55:09] <po---> anyone know how to add padding to a position? I tried     position: {my: 'right bottom+20', at: 'right bottom+20', of: window},     to add 20px but it didn't make any difference
[19:32:26] <easyOnMe> hello
[19:32:36] <easyOnMe> I got this code in codepen.io
[19:32:38] <easyOnMe> http://codepen.io/anon/pen/wWveNQ
[19:32:49] <easyOnMe> I just could not figure out why my jquery is not working
[19:33:24] <easyOnMe> what I wanted to happen is when I clicked on the div with the class="imgContainer" I want number to appear in front of it
[19:33:37] <easyOnMe> but for some reason it does not seem to appear
[19:33:40] <easyOnMe> please help thanks
[19:35:54] <shoky> easyOnMe: you shouldn't call .ready() on anything but $(document). and if you just include your scripts at the end of <body> you don't need .ready at all
[19:36:09] <shoky> easyOnMe: also check your console, there is an error
[19:37:32] <easyOnMe> shoky: I just corrected that error but still the problem is that when I clicked on the second div with the same class the number does not seem to appear
[19:39:16] <easyOnMe> shoky: or if does there seems to be a duplicate of itself
[19:42:52] <easyOnMe> shoky: it seems that it only works on the first instance of the class that you clicked
[19:45:18] <shoky> easyOnMe: why are you doing  $(this).parent() ?  that would get the container #questiondiv and look in there.. not really sure what you want to happen anyways
[19:47:19] <easyOnMe> shoky: what I want to happen is that whenever I clicked any instance of the class imgContainer I will be able to make the class numberOnImage appear right on top of the div of the clicked instance of the class imgContainer
[19:47:38] <shoky> easyOnMe: then why are you going to the parent element?
[19:47:48] <shoky> the parent of imgContainer is #questiondiv
[19:48:03] <shoky> you dont want to be looking in the whole #questiondiv
[19:48:23] <easyOnMe> ok let me correct my code see what happens
[19:48:48] <shoky> and why appending it both to `this` and to this.parent ..
[19:48:53] <shoky> not making much sense
[19:58:19] <easyOnMe> shoky: just wanna ask is this call valid: $(this > ".wrapper").addclass("imgTransparent");
[20:04:27] <easyOnMe> easyOnMe: I just want to apply the css class imgTransparent to the descendents of the imgContainer currently being clicked
[20:09:56] <easyOnMe> shoky: never mind I got it
