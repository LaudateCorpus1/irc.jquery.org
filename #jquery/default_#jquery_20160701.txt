[00:01:11] <silman> I am a beginner trying to make a simple web app in flask, i have made a database but now want to pass the database to the front end and create a button on the website for each row in my database. I was wondering if someone could link to a simple tutorial to do that with ajax? I am not sure what hte best way to store the data on the front end is
[00:02:09] <silman> if my datbase is 1000 items each represented by a JSON object, isn't that a lot to put into one variable on the front end?
[00:04:08] <arc_> i don't see why
[00:05:25] <arc_> a variable just points to some address in memory. if you somehow split the stuff into two variables, it will take up the same amount of memory but it will start from two different addresses
[00:05:26] <arc_> doesn't really matter
[00:05:30] <arc_> memory is extremely fast
[00:07:02] <silman> yeah i guess so
[00:07:09] <silman> it has to be stored somewhere i suppose
[00:51:16] <optics> could anyone help me out, i am trying to get and set a session variable on a dropdown box with a specific id, this is what i have that does not work http://pastebin.com/uF96KwTD
[02:05:46] <Indro> Hi there
[02:06:26] <Indro> Is anyone there
[02:07:21] <Indro> I am new to the jsplumb library and having some problems
[02:10:08] <Cork> Indro: you can ask, but don't expect anyone knowing how the lib works (first i've heard of it)
[02:10:52] <Indro> Yes absolutely
[02:11:23] <Cork> might be better asking the company behind it (i don't think they have a community)
[02:11:26] <Indro> I have a reconnection issue for detached nodes
[02:12:34] <Indro> Have tried all forums and SOF as well
[02:13:03] <Cork> https://jsplumbtoolkit.com/contact.html might be the only option
[02:13:12] <Cork> (or reading the lib)
[02:14:11] <Indro> Have searched all possible free options and this is my last hope of getting any help
[02:14:39] <Cork> ya, as they don't have a community your likely to not have much luck
[02:14:51] <Cork> Indro: you could try making a jsfiddle.net reproducting the problem
[02:15:04] <Indro> Any suggestions any one might have
[02:15:06] <Cork> if it is a generic problem someone might be able to help you, else you have to turn to the developer
[02:15:45] <Indro> I havenot made a jsfiddle , Will try that
[02:16:01] <Indro> Any thing else u suggest I do
[02:16:15] <Cork> nothing to go on so no
[02:16:36] <Cork> "problem with detatched nodes" isn't exactly descriptive
[02:16:47] <Indro> Thank u for ur suggestion
[02:17:16] <Indro> Ok let me explain that in detail
[02:17:26] <Cork> its better to make a jsfiddle
[02:17:30] <Cork> it goes faster
[02:17:53] <Cork> cause it will most likely be needed to understand the problem anyway
[02:18:25] <Indro> Ok Let me do that and then I will return here to tell my expererience
[02:19:07] <Indro> Any way thank you friend
[03:11:13] <anurag1018> hey im new to this . I wish to contribute to github. I know forking html,js,jquery now what?
[03:14:49] <anurag1018> hey im new to this . I wish to contribute to github. I know forking, html,js,jquery now what?
[05:28:59] <codecutter> how do i get the entire html of the a node? e.g. console.log(foo) outputs: '<li>..</li>", I can do fool.innerHTML and so one, how do I get the whole thing including '<li>'?
[05:31:41] <Cork> codecutter: .prop('outerHTML')
[05:32:00] <Cork> or if you use the element directly elm.outerHTML
[05:32:20] <Cork> (those are elements not nodes)
[05:37:50] <codecutter> This is a more general question. this adds the string at the end, how would add it before? htmlString += htmlTemplate .prop('outerHTML');
[05:38:19] <Cork> codecutter: you shouldn't treat the dom as html
[05:38:43] <Cork> += actually serializes the dom into html, then add the new html and parses it all back into dom again
[05:39:00] <Cork> meaning it will destroy all event handlers added to it
[05:39:10] <Cork> or if any js has a reference to an element that will be lost
[05:39:23] <Cork> (as the element will be replaced by a new element)
[05:39:42] <Cork> work with elements if at all possible
[05:39:51] <codecutter> i have no option... if i do multiple appends, i get flicker, i need to somehow strip that html from the mustache template engine and concat to a single string then do i single append
[05:40:12] <Cork> codecutter: you shouldn't append in a loop
[05:40:20] <codecutter> hmm
[05:40:22] <Cork> build a list of new elements and append them in one go
[05:40:25] <codecutter> what do you suggest?
[05:40:46] <codecutter> can i see an get an example?
[05:40:48] <codecutter> hang on
[05:40:54] <codecutter> let me show what i'm doing
[05:41:44] <Cork> ex. target.append($.map(data, function(part) { $('<li>', { text: part.label, data: { key: part.key }})[0]; }));
[05:41:57] <Cork> just build an array with the new elements and then append the array
[05:42:03] <Cork> (or prepend if you want that)
[05:43:22] <codecutter> http://pastebin.com/2scmbAQR
[05:43:41] <Cork> please use jsfiddle in the future
[05:46:41] <Cork> codecutter: https://jsfiddle.net/fwn18z8v/
[06:08:20] <codecutter> Cork: append just give me a bunch of "<<<<<" - https://jsfiddle.net/fwn18z8v/1/
[06:08:41] <codecutter> have a look at my function (it seems to work)
[06:09:20] <codecutter> problem is that screen flickers due to multiple appends
[06:11:03] <Cork> then you removed the $() around the template parser
[06:11:10] <Cork> cause that should convert them to dom elements
[06:11:22] <Cork> anyway gtg
[06:11:49] <codecutter> what line?
[06:17:03] <codecutter>  it should be "return htmlTemplate.prop('outerHTML');" not  r"eturn htmlTemplate.prop('outerHTML')[0];"
[06:17:37] <codecutter> Cork: thanks
[06:27:44] <codecutter> now i need to append each element before after each other
[06:27:58] <codecutter> before NOT after each other
[06:28:44] <codecutter> https://jsfiddle.net/fwn18z8v/2/
[07:00:00] <LeGorillo> Hi, is there a way to listen to a json object returned by another function ?
[07:04:56] <decx> what does that even mean
[07:08:18] <LeGorillo> I have function that has a json response, can I get that json object somehow
[07:08:25] <LeGorillo> without having to pass is
[07:15:15] <Cork> LeGorillo: the function has to pass it or set it as a global/shared variable
[07:38:34] <optics> can any tell me why this selects the dropdown item but does not show it as selected at the top of the dropdown? $("select#meh").val( "<?php echo $_SESSION['name'] ?>" );
[08:00:23] <Cork> optics: too little context
[08:00:35] <Cork> optics: also when i'm at it, don't prefix ids with element names
[08:00:44] <Cork> it slows down the selector for no good reason
[08:01:23] <Cork> ($("select#meh") makes the browser find $('select') and then match them agains the unique id meh)
[08:01:42] <Cork> while $('#meh') selects the element in the id hash table
[08:02:17] <Cork> optics: if you want help with the .val problem reproduce it in a jsfiddle
[08:38:33] <codecutter> remove all children with class 'foo'?
[08:57:24] <jose3_> Howdy folks
[08:57:50] <jak2000> hi all
[09:06:32] <Diplomat> Hey guys.. I have 11 elements on the page which are loaded via ajax. For some reason when I do $('body').on('click', '.className', function(){}) then it executes click event for ALL 11 elements.. not the one I clicked on. Any ideas why?
[09:07:01] <Diplomat> No, it executes click event 11 times on the clicked item
[09:07:17] <Cork> Diplomat: make a jsfiddle with the code
[09:07:32] <Ales> do i need js for this..it doesn't triggers https://jsfiddle.net/ff13h1jx/
[09:08:08] <Cork> Ales: what doesn't trigger?
[09:08:13] <Ales> dropdown..
[09:09:55] <Diplomat> Cork, it would be a bit difficult because of the data that comes from the database and other dependencies that are being generated dynamically
[09:10:01] <Cork> Ales: http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#dropdowns
[09:10:23] <Cork> Diplomat: it isn't possible to tell why things isn't working without seeing the code
[09:10:49] <Cork> i suspect you add the listener in a loop or something like that
[09:10:53] <Cork> but ya, donno
[09:11:47] <Diplomat> Ah
[09:11:51] <Diplomat> it is in a loop
[09:11:56] * Diplomat faceplants
[09:12:12] <deez_nuts> @Ales you need to add Jquery and the bootstrap js
[09:12:25] <Ales> smh
[09:12:52] <swi> Hello.
[09:13:11] <Ales> np deez_nuts
[09:13:13] <Ales> no
[09:13:28] <Cork> Ales: check the link it explains how you use the dropdown
[09:14:09] <swi> I get strange error on js console ' $( ).on is not a function when try to include tooltipster plugin. But i have jquery 2.1.4 and this version of jquery and tooltipster works perfect on other site of mine.
[09:14:44] <Cork> swi: what does $.fn.jquery give you?
[09:15:16] <Cork> i suspect you either run the site in noConflict or you load another lib that steals $
[09:16:13] <swi> Cork: hm. how can i take from $.fn.jquery?
[09:16:24] <Cork> take from?
[09:16:28] <Cork> take what?
[09:16:43] <swi> what you mean by "what does $.fn.jquery give you?"
[09:16:54] <Cork> just type it in the console...
[09:17:12] <swi> 1.6.4
[09:17:25] <swi> but how?
[09:17:29] <deez_nuts> what no ?
[09:17:30] <Cork> there you go
[09:17:37] <Ales> lol guys
[09:17:38] <Ales> nobody said
[09:17:38] <Cork> swi: .on is 1.7+
[09:17:42] <Ales> jquery+bootstrap dont work
[09:17:45] <Ales> together
[09:17:49] <Ales> well, latest one
[09:17:54] <Ales> you have to use lower than 3
[09:17:59] <deez_nuts> https://jsfiddle.net/ff13h1jx/5/
[09:18:13] <deez_nuts> yes not with 3.0
[09:18:18] <swi> Cork: but i use  <script src="/static/js/jquery-2.1.4.min.js"></script> in head
[09:18:35] <Cork> swi: something else loads 1.6.4 and overwrites your lib
[09:18:39] <Cork> so you load it twice
[09:18:47] <Cork> (at least)
[09:18:51] <Ales> what jquery version is best? 2.2.4?
[09:18:59] <Cork> Ales: "latest"
[09:19:05] <Ales> doesnt work with bs..
[09:19:12] <Cork> 1.x, 2.x or 3.x series
[09:19:20] <Cork> they are all supported
[09:19:24] <Ales> 3x isn't
[09:19:28] <Ales> gave me console error
[09:19:32] <Ales> not compatible with bootstrap
[09:19:34] <swi> Cork: understand.
[09:19:34] <Cork> i meant they are supported by jquery...
[09:19:48] <Ales> i'll use latest 2x smh
[09:19:56] <Cork> so use 1.x if you need old ie support 2.x if 3.x doesn't work for you
[09:20:04] <Cork> as simple as that
[09:20:48] <swi> jquerytools.. damn you
[09:21:06] <Cork> ya, i love libs that embed other libs...
[09:21:07] <swi> Cork: thanks a lot!
[09:21:19] <Cork> (note it is a STUPID idea)
[09:21:30] <swi> Cork: on their site you 'can' choose include jquery or not..
[09:21:43] <swi> seems you cant
[09:25:42] <Ales> you can't download jquery scripts lower than 3?
[09:26:08] <darkling> Use the CDN link on the download page. They're all in there.
[09:26:42] <Ales> yeah, heard it's unsafe
[09:27:02] <Ales> i'll just use cdn link thanks
[09:36:59] <notchris> I keep getting expeceted an assignment or function call and instead saw an expression
[09:37:26] <notchris> on this http://pastie.org/private/6sc1hceglzb3prw2z2ira
[09:38:23] <notchris> !$tr && ($tr = $(this).closest('tr.inline-edit-post'));
[09:38:30] <Cork> notchris: carefull key isn't defined on line 7 so it becomes global
[09:38:45] <Cork> notchris: also line 2 makes no sense
[09:39:24] <notchris> It's a semi popular wp plugin im trying to fix
[09:39:26] <notchris> broke in new update :X
[09:39:30] <notchris> But you're right about the key
[09:39:35] <notchris> I did not notice that, thank you Cork
[09:39:43] <notchris> I'll try to figure out whats going on with line 2
[09:40:11] <Cork> hmm i suspect what they mean is if(!$tr) { $tr = $(this).closest('tr.inline-edit-post'); }
[09:40:43] <Cork> it should work but it is scary as it doesn't have ; after it so it gets scary if the lib is every minified
[09:41:48] <notchris> Ahhhh
[09:41:55] <Cork> notchris: same with value on line 10 as far as i can tell (though it might not be part of the paste)
[09:41:55] <notchris> The last error is that key situation
[09:42:07] <Cork> i would recommend replacing it with a clean if
[09:42:19] <Cork> much less hacky, and not much more characters
[09:42:40] <Cork> (it can actually be as many if you skip the extra spaces i added)
[09:42:41] <notchris> For the value*=1
[09:42:41] <notchris> ?
[09:42:59] <Cork> !$tr && ($tr = $(this).closest('tr.inline-edit-post')) => if(!$tr) {$tr = $(this).closest('tr.inline-edit-post')}
[09:43:07] <Cork> much easier to read
[09:43:28] <swi> Cork: thanks again.
[09:43:42] <Cork> notchris: and ya, in the pastie the value isn't defined
[09:43:58] <notchris> Hmmm
[09:44:07] <notchris> So in WP, the only error I get it
[09:44:08] <notchris> $tr.find('input.acf-quick-edit-color_picker').wpColorPicker();
[09:44:14] <Cork> (actually i'm not sure i would like to use that plugin, the code is quite bad)
[09:44:15] <notchris> $tr is not defined
[09:44:22] <notchris> acf-quickedit.js:50 Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'find' of undefined
[09:44:43] <Cork> notchris: so you have to find where $tr is defined
[09:44:51] <notchris> Cork: Here is whole paste http://pastie.org/private/gcq97kl4ydtxuwvxixsqca
[09:44:56] <Cork> its prob another underfined variable somewhere
[09:45:06] <notchris> It's defined in a group defenition
[09:45:06] <notchris> var i,key,value,$tr;
[09:46:06] <Cork> notchris: i would suggest changing that to var i,key,value,$tr=$();
[09:46:22] <Cork> that way $tr won't crash if $parent.find('[data-acf-field-key]').length < 1
[09:46:56] <Cork> (also i'm not sure why they set it in a loop when they only want the last match...)
[09:47:37] <notchris> Hmmmm
[09:47:45] <notchris> So that fixed the console error
[09:47:54] <notchris> But the plugin does not function
[09:47:56] <notchris> Odd
[09:48:04] <Cork> $parent.find('[data-acf-field-key]').length is most likely 0
[09:49:29] <notchris> Hmm
[09:49:32] <notchris> It found it
[09:50:02] <notchris> You're right
[09:50:06] <notchris> It is 0
[09:50:41] <Cork> ya, the more i see of that code the less impressed i get...
[09:51:07] <Cork> though that is a common theme for wp plugins for some reasons...
[10:24:14] <notchris> Cork: aint it the truth xD
[10:24:27] <notchris> I may just manually set this up, it cant be that difficult following the adv doc
[10:25:54] <Ziberius> hello
[10:31:32] <Ziberius> I'm having problems preventing event propagation
[10:31:48] <Ziberius> shouldn't event.stopImmediatePropagation() do it?
[10:32:25] <Ziberius> I run that on a focus on an input and theres a click event on a larger div that contains that input
[10:32:30] <Ziberius> the click event still runs
[10:32:55] <Sitman5000> asd
[10:38:56] <shoky> Ziberius: focus and click are different events, one doesn't propagate into the other
[10:41:09] <Ziberius> shoky I see
[10:41:30] <Ziberius> So if I use a click event on the input it should work?
[10:41:46] <shoky> yup
[10:41:49] <Ziberius> nice
[10:41:54] <Ziberius> I'll try that thanx
[11:29:19] <romistrub> anyone here use qunit?
[11:29:51] <Ales> why this doesn't read input and then shows calculated price depending on select option? https://jsfiddle.net/g8hxzLjg/
[11:30:22] <decx> it tells you in the console
[11:30:25] <romistrub> this test example is not completing the tests... it must have something to do with the async() in both the beforeEach and afterEach of the module
[11:30:26] <romistrub> https://gist.github.com/romistrub/7151b605874251227620c5dcae73e393
[11:30:56] <romistrub> because when I do the async either before OR after, it works fine; but if I do one in both, the first one never finishes
[11:31:17] <romistrub> I'm just trying to get someone else here to confirm that I'm not insane, and that this is actually happening
[11:31:23] <Ales> decx i fixed still nothing https://jsfiddle.net/g8hxzLjg/1/
[11:31:43] <decx> because currency is never defined
[11:33:16] <decx> and val() is a function not a property
[11:34:06] <decx> and the ux is bad
[11:34:15] <decx> and more caching plz
[11:35:23] <romistrub> where do I submit a bug report?
[11:35:42] <Ales> decx is it also because i just grabbed amount and select? do i also have to select #price
[11:36:59] <decx> no, it's just that it's val(val) and not val = val
[11:38:00] <Ales>       if (currency.val('€')){
[11:38:05] <Ales> i did this
[11:39:47] <Ales> i changed https://jsfiddle.net/g8hxzLjg/7/
[11:40:27] <decx> checking val is still ===
[11:41:05] <decx> different: https://jsfiddle.net/g8hxzLjg/8/
[11:42:28] <decx> now you just have to update the exchange rate value as the pound drops into nothingness
[11:46:02] <Ales> lol..
[11:48:47] <Ales> i get $ is not defined decx do i need $(document).ready
[11:57:49] <Ales> decx i'm using excatly yours code, i updated ui now, still not working https://jsfiddle.net/tmk2dkmz/1/
[11:58:23] <robertmaxrees> where is currency defined?
[11:58:45] <decx> start to use the console fam
[11:58:51] <robertmaxrees> ^
[11:58:54] <decx> a whole new world, a brand new place you never knew
[12:02:50] <Ales> working on jsfiddle, not on document
[12:03:11] <decx> http://fixingthesejquery.com/
[12:03:12] <Ales> Uncaught ReferenceError: $ is not defined console
[12:03:35] <robertmaxrees> ...
[12:03:39] <robertmaxrees> so what does that tell you< Ales?
[12:04:59] <Ales> ok, i have link jquery at top.. But i thought it's better at bottom for performance
[12:05:15] <robertmaxrees> you need to link in the correct order.
[12:05:36] <robertmaxrees> you can do it at the bottom of the page, so long as all your other code that relies on it comes after it.
[12:06:02] <Ales> alright
[12:09:55] <Ales> how do i append string to calculated value https://jsfiddle.net/tmk2dkmz/3/ ?check line 8!
[12:10:28] <robertmaxrees> you add it to your return.
[12:10:42] <robertmaxrees> (amount.val() * typeValue.val()).toFixed(2) + '$'
[12:15:33] <Ales> ty robertmaxrees i read manual on learn.jquery and it's useless i forgot pretty much everything. learn by practice..
[12:15:39] <robertmaxrees> err.
[12:15:46] <robertmaxrees> learn is actually incredibly useful as a reference.
[12:16:23] <robertmaxrees> and gives a great starting point.  expecting to just read it and then understand everything going on is... kind of missing the point.
[12:16:31] <Ales> yeah it is, i spent 3 days reading it, then didn't use jquery for 1 week and i forgot everything
[12:16:38] <Ales> i think i remember more with practice robertmaxrees
[12:16:42] <robertmaxrees> ...
[12:16:46] <robertmaxrees> and referring back to learn.
[12:16:51] <robertmaxrees> you use it while you're writing code.
[12:17:00] <Ales> i just read
[12:17:09] <robertmaxrees> that was your problem.
[12:17:17] <Ales> that's waste of time i guess
[12:17:31] <robertmaxrees> just reading it doesn't make sense.  use it as a reference.
[12:17:47] <taplar> use it in a hobby project, ^_^
[12:17:53] <robertmaxrees> exactly.
[12:18:02] <robertmaxrees> or find some other way to retain that knowledge.
[12:19:01] <Ales> taplar you got any idea for domain name
[12:19:03] <Ales> i love taplar
[12:19:11] <Ales> good name ngl
[12:19:20] <taplar> ales.com works
[12:30:29] <filadome> is it possible to animate an accordian when content is appended?
[12:31:08] <filadome> i'm using: heightStyle: "content"
[12:31:25] <filadome> when content is appended to the div, it shows up without any animation
[12:31:33] <robertmaxrees> sounds about right.
[12:35:42] * taplar makes a sacrifice to the weekend gods that they let him go early today
[12:37:05] <AwkwardCough> whoa man... you okay?
[12:37:27] <taplar> you need to join me.  maybe combined sacrifices can increase our chances
[12:37:55] <decx> you got plans or what?
[12:38:04] <decx> get good and drunk and sing the star-spangled banner
[12:38:08] <taplar> sure not-work, :D
[12:38:18] <robertmaxrees> DUH
[12:38:28] * AwkwardCough makes a sacrifice to the weekday gods so that taplar has to stay late today
[12:38:30] <robertmaxrees> decx that's what we do every day.
[12:38:35] <taplar> mother f....
[12:38:51] <AwkwardCough> oops I think I did it wrong
[12:41:44] <taplar> i actually don't think i could sing the ss banner if i had to
[12:42:00] <AwkwardCough> how un-american geesh
[12:42:14] <taplar> i never watch sports.  i never hear it
[12:42:52] <robertmaxrees> it's also a strangely technically challenging anthem.
[12:44:07] <AwkwardCough> true... I only know it because I had to do an analysis on the lyric and how it relates to historical moments for school
[12:44:40] <taplar> i could probably do the other one, the oh say can you see one
[12:45:24] <taplar> unless that is the ss banner...
[12:45:34] <AwkwardCough> it is...
[12:45:36] <robertmaxrees> that's the anthem >.>
[12:45:40] <robertmaxrees> #america
[12:46:06] <taplar> lol, losing my mind
[12:46:20] <AwkwardCough> man maybe you do need to get out of here early today
[12:46:41] <taplar> it's my destiny to go home and play some Destiny
[12:47:44] <AwkwardCough> ahh, as the american tradition has always been
[12:47:56] <robertmaxrees> manifest destiny
[12:47:59] <taplar> yup, to lose terribly in a FPS to some chinese tween
[12:48:47] <taplar> or retiree
[12:48:53] <taplar> my skillz do not pay billz
[12:54:53] <taplar> in retrospect our anthem isn't very apathetic towards the blind
[12:55:40] <AwkwardCough> well the dude did write it during a battle and was mostly recording what he saw and felt
[12:56:32] <taplar> there could have been blind dudes on the field.  especially after the rockets red glare
[12:58:56] <taplar> i'm not as good with the history jokes.  just like bell said
[12:59:16] <AwkwardCough> actually the rockets red glare was actually alluding to the cannon fire coming from the british navy and from the american fort
[12:59:44] <taplar> you know the one dude at the party who is always correcting what everyone else is saying...
[12:59:46] <AwkwardCough> red glow being from when the cannons fired and had the smoke
[12:59:53] <taplar> :P
[13:00:02] <AwkwardCough> HAH thats why i dont get invited to parties
[13:00:07] <AwkwardCough> oh wait....
[13:02:50] <taplar> what?!?!
[13:03:04] <taplar> "The poem was set to the tune of a popular British song written by John Stafford Smith for...."
[13:03:20] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[13:03:26] <taplar> that's funny
[13:04:30] <taplar> though it does also mention my country tis of thee being identical to save the queen
[13:05:08] <darkling> God Save the Queen is a dreadful dirge. Although it is one of the few national anthems in 3/4 time.
[13:05:27] <darkling> Most countries go for a bombastic 4/4 or a martial 2/4.
[13:06:02] * taplar wanders back to wikipedia
[13:06:07] <robertmaxrees> darkling becuase most countries anthems were written in pubs and were drinking songs.
[13:06:17] <robertmaxrees> :)\
[13:06:32] <taplar> bombastic just makes me think of a shaggy song
[13:07:05] <taplar> side note.  time to donate to wikipedia again folks
[13:07:20] <AwkwardCough> its always time I thought
[13:07:32] <taplar> but with ads!
[13:07:35] <taplar> *now
[13:29:21] <taplar> slow jq day?
[13:31:51] <robertmaxrees> probably.
[13:32:03] <robertmaxrees> i'll bet the weekend is contributing.
[13:33:55] <AwkwardCough> good chance
[13:44:59] <z1haze_work> can I get the clicked submit button from the event on submit() ?
[13:45:46] <taplar> original event maybe?
[13:45:55] <robertmaxrees> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5721724/jquery-how-to-get-which-button-was-clicked-upon-form-submission
[13:46:26] <z1haze_work> What do you mean?
[13:46:57] <z1haze_work> ah thanks robertmaxrees would .attr('name') give me the name of the button?
[13:47:03] <robertmaxrees> use .prop()
[13:47:07] <robertmaxrees> avoid .attr()
[13:47:14] <z1haze_work> oh, why is this
[13:47:29] <robertmaxrees> you want the DOM property, not the html attribute.
[13:48:13] <z1haze_work> i want the <input type="submit" name="this_button"
[13:48:28] <robertmaxrees> right, you want that DOM property for the element.
[13:48:34] <robertmaxrees> the name property.
[13:49:22] <z1haze_work> ok so inside my submit() function im trying console.log($("button[type=submit][clicked=true]").prop('name')); and coming up undefined
[13:49:55] <taplar> there's two parts to that answer
[13:50:10] <robertmaxrees> z1haze_work gotta to more than just copy/paste code.
[13:50:39] <dp_> I have a UI-draggable item (using a helper function to build a clone) that positions itself correctly if I'm at the top of the window when I start dragging; however, if I scroll the window, then the clone item is pushed down from my cursor by the amount I've scrolled the window. I've tried setting position: absolute; and top: -<scroll_amount>px, but it doesn't seem to help. Any suggestions?
[13:51:34] <taplar> cancel the draggable on scroll, :D
[13:51:53] <taplar> slap their hand.  bad user!
[13:52:03] <dp_> taplar: I'm sorry? They've scrolled the window *before* dragging.
[13:52:06] <taplar> otherwise, maybe try position: fixed
[13:52:19] <dp_> I'll try fixed as well.
[13:52:21] <robertmaxrees> sounds like there's some other styling conflict going on?
[13:52:47] <z1haze_work> robertmaxrees: console.log($(document.activeElement).prop('name')); works
[13:52:56] <robertmaxrees> z1haze_work...
[13:53:06] <robertmaxrees> why do people not actually read anything?
[13:53:13] <taplar> it's hard
[13:53:16] <z1haze_work> huh?
[13:53:21] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:53:24] <z1haze_work> i just found a solution that works with less code..
[13:53:38] <z1haze_work> was sharing it
[13:53:47] <robertmaxrees> i would still go with the other version.
[13:53:57] <robertmaxrees> you're relying on an ephemeral relationship that may or may not break later.
[13:54:20] <z1haze_work> well in our case, you cant submit a form without a named submit button
[13:54:41] <robertmaxrees> that has nothing to do with that i just said.
[13:54:44] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[13:54:52] <z1haze_work> ok
[13:54:58] <dp_> taplar: position: fixed worked. I wonder why that worked when position: absolute didn't.
[13:55:03] <dp_> Thanks for the tip, though.
[13:55:09] <taplar> absolute is based on the page
[13:55:14] <taplar> fixed is based on your viewport
[13:55:18] <robertmaxrees> dp_ fixed positioning completely removes it from the page flow.
[13:55:31] <dp_> Ah. Gotcha.
[13:55:32] <robertmaxrees> z1haze_work you don't care about the "active" element, you care about the one that was clicked.  the active one could change accidentally later.
[13:57:29] <z1haze_work> it could somehow change between clicking the button to submit the form and when the ajax request sends off?
[13:57:34] <z1haze_work> instantly..
[13:57:45] <robertmaxrees> you never know.
[13:57:56] <z1haze_work> ill be a daredevil today.
[13:58:01] <robertmaxrees> i wouldn't.
[13:58:02] <robertmaxrees> but OK.
[13:58:20] <z1haze_work> it will match the rest of the code in this site :)
[13:58:34] <robertmaxrees> i would go with working towards making it better.
[13:58:35] <robertmaxrees> but sure.
[13:58:53] <taplar> sounds like broken window logic
[13:59:05] <z1haze_work> its a can of worms
[13:59:14] <robertmaxrees> writing better code is a can of worms?
[13:59:20] <robertmaxrees> i doubt you'd be breaking style.
[13:59:22] <z1haze_work> no, attempting to make it better
[13:59:45] <taplar> in what regard?
[14:00:07] <robertmaxrees> right now your logic is literally "making this one part better is a bad idea"
[14:00:26] <robertmaxrees> you're not changing anything other than adding better code.
[14:00:48] <taplar> https://blog.codinghorror.com/the-broken-window-theory/
[14:01:25] <pokergod> i'm doing a $('select').find('option').not(['[value="10"]').before($('<option>',{value:file,text:file},'</option>'));  this works, but it does not select the item.  Anyone know how i can place this item at the start when it's not 10?
[14:01:42] <taplar> your not looks wrong
[14:01:55] <taplar> extra [
[14:02:02] <robertmaxrees> that before looks wrong, too.
[14:02:49] <pokergod> i typed it in, incorrectly
[14:03:01] <pokergod> i'm doing a $('select').find('option').not('[value="10"]').before($('<option>',{value:file,text:file},'</option>'));  this works, but it does not select the item.  Anyone know how i can place this item at the start when it's not 10?
[14:04:18] <taplar> your not getting any sort of parse error?
[14:04:28] <robertmaxrees> that before still looks wrong to me.
[14:04:36] <taplar> ya
[14:04:51] <pokergod> how do i add an option, skipping value=10 to be at the top?
[14:04:54] <robertmaxrees> particularly $('<option>',{value:file,text:file},'</option>')
[14:05:14] <robertmaxrees> you keep saying "skipping" - what do you mean by that?
[14:06:03] <taplar> and 'add an option' is suspect also.  if you have multiple options that before will insert multiple times
[14:06:41] <taplar> lol i just realized what he's trying ot do with the before
[14:06:47] <taplar> take out the closing tag string
[14:07:16] <z1haze_work> if my json data is returning like "{\"message\":\"Thank you for signing up!\"}" vs {"message":"Thank you for signing up!"} what do i need to do?
[14:07:28] <taplar> nothing, just parse it
[14:07:30] <robertmaxrees> fix your server to actually encode that correctly.
[14:07:48] <robertmaxrees> it shouldn't be escaping like that.
[14:08:13] <taplar> oh, the outer " are actually there i guess
[14:08:27] <z1haze_work> haha i wish it was that easy most of the time
[14:08:29] <robertmaxrees> yeah, the issue is those should be ''
[14:08:32] <z1haze_work> luckily this time it was
[14:08:52] <z1haze_work> the template had some 'encoding' property on i dunno what it does but turning it off fixed it
[14:09:45] <robertmaxrees> "template" scares me here.
[14:10:23] <z1haze_work> ah shit it didnt fix it
[14:10:39] <z1haze_work> and robertmaxrees yea i know... the way this stuff works is a totally different animal
[14:10:40] <robertmaxrees> please tell me you're using a JSON library to generate this.
[14:11:18] <z1haze_work> you have to return a 'view' or 'template' from every pipeline request in this system
[14:11:31] <robertmaxrees> what's the "system"?
[14:11:37] <z1haze_work> demandware
[14:11:57] <z1haze_work> so i just made an empty file and sets the content type or json and just print out he json that I sent from the server
[14:12:06] <printForever> how to check if visible?
[14:12:28] <robertmaxrees> printForever... did you even try to google that one? lol
[14:12:28] <z1haze_work> is(':visible') ?
[14:13:44] <printForever> thanks
[14:13:50] <robertmaxrees> ><
[14:13:52] <printForever> robertmaxrees, no I did
[14:13:57] <printForever> :P
[14:13:59] <robertmaxrees> what did you find, then?
[14:14:11] <printForever> I wrote "no, I did" ;)
[14:14:20] <robertmaxrees> then which is it?
[14:14:46] <printForever> $(element).is(":visible");
[14:14:54] <robertmaxrees> i mean did you try to search for it?
[14:15:04] <printForever> I did
[14:15:08] <robertmaxrees> and what did you find?
[14:15:13] <printForever> I thought there is something easier, faster, easier
[14:15:17] <printForever> or faster
[14:15:19] <printForever> or easier
[14:15:34] <robertmaxrees> 'kay
[14:15:43] <printForever> ;)
[14:15:59] <robertmaxrees> i'd ask that next time, becuase :visible can be really slow on pre 3.0 versions of jquery.
[14:16:18] <robertmaxrees> and depending on your CSS/html/etc there are far better ways to handle that.
[14:16:21] <z1haze_work> so robertmaxrees if i have an object, lets call it responseJSON and then i do responseJSON.message = "This is the message" and then JSON.stringify(responseJSON) and return that .. is this how I should be going about this?
[14:16:34] <robertmaxrees> z1haze_work i know nothing about demandware.
[14:16:47] <z1haze_work> im talking about javascript
[14:16:47] <taplar> returning a json response?
[14:17:06] <robertmaxrees> if you need to stringify it, sure.  you should be able to just toss is back.
[14:17:07] <taplar> responseJSON would be like on an ajax response object
[14:17:18] <z1haze_work> its just a variable name
[14:17:22] <taplar> egh
[14:18:16] <bitcycle> Hey all.  I'm a UI noob, and I'm wondering -- is there a UI dev channel on Freenode that I can ask noobish questions?
[14:18:17] <z1haze_work> it looks like this: http://dpaste.com/10ETHSZ but not expecting you to understand completely.. im just asking about storing json in a variable in gernal
[14:18:20] <z1haze_work> general*
[14:18:43] <robertmaxrees> bitcycle there's #web, #css, and a few other places.
[14:18:54] <robertmaxrees> there's also #design
[14:19:04] <bitcycle> robertmaxrees: awesome. thx!
[14:19:07] <bitcycle> join #web
[14:19:08] <z1haze_work> pdict.rseponseJSON is what i am sending back to the front in inside a template that has content type of application/json
[14:20:38] <z1haze_work> looks like my Content-Type:text/html;charset=UTF-8 isnt coming back as json
[14:20:48] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[14:20:59] <z1haze_work> the http response header
[14:21:13] <robertmaxrees> lol
[14:21:17] <z1haze_work> is coming back as text/html
[14:21:22] <z1haze_work> which is clearly why it looks like that
[14:21:28] <robertmaxrees> jquery is VERY forgiving when it comes to headers.
[14:21:30] <robertmaxrees> but ok.
[14:21:58] <z1haze_work> it should say Content-Type:application/json.
[14:22:00] <z1haze_work> but ok
[14:22:38] <robertmaxrees> are you saying that's symptomatic for whatever is causing your server to set also escape the JSON?
[14:23:17] <taplar> what's the back end?
[14:23:17] <z1haze_work> probably
[14:23:23] <z1haze_work> demandware
[14:23:32] <taplar> so out of your control
[14:23:34] <robertmaxrees> z1haze_work okay.  that's not the impression i was getting from you earlier.
[14:23:35] <z1haze_work> yep
[14:23:57] <z1haze_work> reading what little documentation i have says i cant set the response type in my script
[14:24:01] <z1haze_work> but doesnt seem to be doing anything
[14:24:17] <taplar> not a biggie, just have to potentially parse it yourself then
[14:24:54] <robertmaxrees> that escaping is batty.
[14:25:48] <z1haze_work> yea im wondering if thats what this encoding property is suposed to do
[14:26:29] <z1haze_work> if its a content type for json, its supposed to be a string isnt it?
[14:26:43] <taplar> all responses are strings
[14:26:58] <taplar> or bytes
[14:27:03] <z1haze_work> ok, well it should understand how to write it
[14:27:11] <taplar> content type just tells the browser how to interpret it potentially
[14:28:01] <pokergod> if you insertAfter with a select, how do you get it selected at the sometime?
[14:28:22] <robertmaxrees> pokergod you set the value of the select to the value of the thing you added.
[14:29:34] <z1haze_work> well its not interprettying it right, im thinking its because the headres are wrong
[14:29:49] <robertmaxrees> z1haze_work what's the raw response you're getting from the server?
[14:29:57] <z1haze_work> interpreting
[14:30:07] <z1haze_work> that escaped stuff
[14:30:21] <robertmaxrees> then yeah, your server is doing something wrong.
[14:30:35] <jamiejackson> how do i get the first child that is an <li>? i tried `$(this).children('li').first()`, but it bombs.
[14:30:38] <darkling> If you're returning a string from the server, then that's probably correct behaviour.
[14:30:53] <robertmaxrees> jamiejackson how does it "bomb"?
[14:31:06] <z1haze_work> darkling: with a response header of json?
[14:31:15] <robertmaxrees> darkling he's using a platform that doesn't really allow him to control that much.
[14:31:29] <darkling> i.e. if it's expecting a data structure, and you're passing it the JSON already converted to a string, that's going to produce that result.
[14:31:39] <z1haze_work> robertmaxrees: its not that we cant control, its just super convoluted and little documentation
[14:31:50] <robertmaxrees> okay.
[14:31:50] <jamiejackson> this.children is not a function < robertmaxrees
[14:32:00] <z1haze_work> im sure its possible
[14:32:09] <z1haze_work> their api docs suck though
[14:32:15] <robertmaxrees> jamiejackson sounds like you haven't loaded jquery.
[14:32:27] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, something is WAY broken.
[14:33:25] <robertmaxrees> jamiejackson https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/xw4Lmcqd/
[14:34:27] <jamiejackson> robertmaxrees: i think it's working now. will figure out where i am now.
[14:44:23] <pokergod> if i do find('option').not('[value="10"]').not('[value="20"]').index(), i correctly get index of 2, is this the correct way to skip options?
[14:44:41] <robertmaxrees> i would look at using .filter() instead.
[14:45:21] <pokergod> why?
[14:45:37] <robertmaxrees> because it'll be clearer to use that instead of chaining .not() calls.
[14:55:18] <pokergod> how do you do the equivalent filter for 2 not's?
[14:56:45] <robertmaxrees> give it a function.
[14:58:29] <robertmaxrees> something like this https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/jwjw5kdb/
[15:02:35] <gambl0re> hi robert, hows going?
[15:08:10] <mmmveggies> going is probably a momentum, so it's mass * velocity
[15:11:09] <z1haze_work> if in my success: function(data) { ... and the response looks like https://gyazo.com/2ce1e8dc7143896afcf9b2e39320fba8 the content would be data.message, right?
[15:26:05] <taplar> console.log(data.message)
[15:29:11] <z1haze_work> undefined
[15:29:23] <z1haze_work> but i figured it out, for the error function it comes back in data.responseJSON
[17:55:03] <silman> I am new to front end work and want to dynamically create a gallery-like set of images on the page from a set of database objects that are stored in as json on the front end. I was thinking of just using append but defining the HTML inside javascript as a string and saving it to a variable seems bulky. Is there a better way to accomplish this?
[17:56:07] <robertmaxrees> use a templating engine.
[18:04:48] <adamsilver> How do I change this $(document).pjax('a', '#pjax-container'); to say all links except the ones with no-pjax <a no-pjax="">
[18:07:07] <robertmaxrees> depends - does that first arg take full jquery selectors?
[18:07:59] <robertmaxrees> adamsilver
[18:08:18] <adamsilver> robertmaxrees: yes
[18:08:31] <robertmaxrees> https://api.jquery.com/not-selector/
[18:08:44] <robertmaxrees> combine that with an attribute selector.
[18:09:51] <adamsilver> robertmaxrees: cool, this worked: $(document).pjax('a:not([no-pjax])', '#pjax-container');
[18:10:17] <robertmaxrees> adamsilver rad.
[18:10:25] <robertmaxrees> why are you excluding some stuff?
[18:11:00] <adamsilver> robertmaxrees: changing the entire layout so basically I want to force a full reload
[18:11:10] <robertmaxrees> eeep.
[18:11:11] <robertmaxrees> alright.,
[18:31:52] <jdelers> what does $.ajax().always() method do ? are there any official docs for this
[18:35:55] <printForever> if(neNumber.match(/^\d+$/)) {
[18:36:06] <printForever> why doesn't this match +3390950953
[18:36:26] <printForever> if I enter anything, even only numbers, it just doesen't work
[18:38:23] <shoky> jdelers: docs for $.ajax have docs for it. it's an alternative to the "complete" option, same thing mostly
[18:38:56] <shoky> printForever: because .match() doesn't return a boolean
[18:39:05] <printForever> oh crap
[18:39:08] <printForever> what does it return?
[18:39:39] <shoky> printForever: oh oops confused it with a different one, it does return a truthy/falsy value
[18:39:47] <printForever> yeah
[18:39:49] <shoky> not really a boolean but you can treat it as one
[18:39:54] <printForever> got me confused for a sec
[18:40:24] <shoky> you're matching the string '+3390950953'  or without the +  ?
[18:40:54] <jdelers> shoky:  thnx :)
[18:41:07] <printForever> :(
[18:41:10] <printForever> tnx shoky
[18:41:14] <printForever> with +
[18:41:16] <shoky> heh..
[18:41:20] <printForever> is the solution
[18:41:22] <printForever> ./[0-9-()+]{3,20}/
[18:42:01] <shoky> mm that matches a bunch of stuff ;p
[18:42:15] <printForever> I need just +13423423432
[18:42:31] <shoky> that would match  +++
[18:42:50] <printForever> any revision?
[18:42:54] <shoky> or ()_()
[18:43:01] <shoky> er ()-()
[18:43:15] <shoky> donno what you want exaclty..
[18:43:26] <shoky> or at all ;p
[18:43:57] <shoky> cause if you want digits possibly starting with a +
[18:44:20] <shoky> then..   /^\+?\d+$/
[18:44:31] <shoky> i.e.  just add \+?  at the beginning
[18:45:14] <printForever> shoky, .delay(1000).show(); does not work for some reason :( why could it be?
[18:45:33] <shoky> .delay only delays queued stuff like animations
[18:45:37] <shoky> show is not an animation
[18:45:38] <printForever> ohhhhh
[18:45:43] <printForever> right
[18:45:51] <printForever> any workaround?
[18:45:55] <shoky> setTimeout
[18:45:57] <printForever> ok
[18:46:22] <printForever>  .delay() is not a replacement for JavaScript's native setTimeout function,
[18:46:28] <printForever> is there a jQuery answer to setTimeout?
[18:46:33] <shoky> huh?
[18:46:42] <printForever> a direct replacement
[18:46:49] <shoky> there's no need for a replacement :)
[18:46:55] <printForever> ok
[18:47:02] <printForever> I say there is! :D
[18:47:05] <shoky> lol
[18:47:13] <printForever> ;)
[20:45:52] <nodex> a
[21:21:33] <bayman> why won't my dialog show? https://jsfiddle.net/bayman/hww9ueyk/2/
[21:26:57] <sillyslux> https://jsfiddle.net/hww9ueyk/3/
[21:27:42] <bayman> oh thanks
[21:28:02] <bayman> but how do i proceed when it clicks Yes?
[21:28:17] <bayman> yes just closes the modal
[21:29:14] <sillyslux> https://jsfiddle.net/hww9ueyk/4/
[21:32:10] <bayman> why won't this work? https://jsfiddle.net/bayman/hww9ueyk/5/
[21:35:58] <bayman> nevermind, it's formDeactivate.submit();
[22:13:28] <phelix> so if I had an object that was in the format like  'KEY' : 'Value' anyone know how I could format multiple items seperated by comma that would be like (key=value),(key=value),(key=value) without a trailing comma?
[22:21:35] <sillyslux> phelix, https://jsfiddle.net/950vL2s1/
[22:25:40] <phelix> sillyslux, Got it thanks!!
