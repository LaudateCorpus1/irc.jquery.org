[13:05:02] <paule32> hello
[13:05:16] <paule32> i have this paste code in work: http://dpaste.com/0K7EY8W
[13:05:28] <paule32> it display me a easyui dialog
[13:05:34] <paule32> with some text
[13:06:27] <paule32> first call of the function, i get dialog on screen, and when i click the close button, the dialog disapper/closed
[13:06:57] <paule32> but, when i call the function in the paste, i get dialog, but with different css style
[13:07:30] <paule32> means, the css style (width, height) seems be reset
[13:10:33] <paule32> is there a mistake in code?
[14:48:33] <Cork> paule32: you would have to check the documentation for easyui
[14:49:04] <Cork> paule32: normally js don't have css types in the width/height values, but might be easyui does something there
[14:49:24] <Cork> ("400px" would normally be just 400)
[14:50:13] <Cork> paule32: also you your tmp variable is undefined
[14:54:15] <paule32> Cork: and the remove stuff
[14:56:43] <Cork> paule32: also note that the line 3-5 isn't guaranteed to have run when you display the dialog btw
[14:56:57] <Cork> it is even most likely not ran before you display the dialog
[14:57:39] <Cork> (unless easy ui use some form of animation)
[14:58:19] <Cork> as the rest of the function is synchronous, while $.get isn't
[14:58:32] <paule32> the problem on easyui is, that you must define all at start up
[14:59:01] <paule32> if you doing stuff after ready load website, you have to reparse the content
[14:59:26] <Cork> might be better to not use there widgets then
[14:59:42] <Cork> cause like i said the <style> tag there won't do what you expect
[15:00:00] <Cork> styles aren't js
[15:00:15] <paule32> else
[15:00:31] <paule32> dont looking to style:
[15:00:50] <paule32> is the create class, and remove class ok?
[15:01:07] <paule32> or shall be write it different else?
[15:02:51] <Cork> i would save a reference to the dialog instead of wildly selecting in the document after a class
[15:02:51] <paule32> lets tmp in line 21:  <div> foo </div>
[15:02:56] <Cork> then you know what you remove
[15:04:20] <Cork> just do var dialog = $($.parseHTML(tmp)); dialog.appendTo('#desktop');
[15:04:28] <Cork> and then in the onClose dialog.remove()
[15:05:20] <Cork> and if line 34 doesn't destroy the dialog before you see it, then it means easyui moved the dialog content somewhere else
[15:05:37] <Cork> and you would have to look into what it does to solve that
[15:37:06] <paule32> so
[15:37:19] <paule32> i did it statically, and it work now
[15:37:28] <paule32> thank you for your hints and tips
[15:45:09] <Cork> np
[17:46:10] <Bwarzz> Hi everyone
[17:46:43] <Bwarzz> i try to apply a click on many buttons i selected using a regex on an id
[17:47:04] <Bwarzz> in the function called after the click, can i still access the clicked element with $(this) ?
