[03:31:20] <zotherst1> how to make a variable inside a javascript class?
[03:34:03] <Cork> inside a what?
[03:35:31] <Cork> zotherst1: if you mean a code class like in an object structure; javascript doesn't have that (yet)
[03:35:54] <Cork> if you mean an element class, then i have no clue what you are trying to do
[03:36:53] <rollingWolf> So I heard some rumors that Microsoft was making their own engine to rival NodeJS. Anyone that has any info on this?
[03:36:54] <zotherst1> its a reactjs thing
[03:37:15] <zotherst1> class Component extends React.component
[03:37:28] <Cork> zotherst1: then i suspect you should ask that in a channel for react and not js then
[03:37:31] <zotherst1> i want to make a variable on the class scope to be used in dif functions
[03:37:42] <zotherst1> i thought it is just plain js
[03:37:45] <zotherst1> thnx
[03:37:47] <Cork> it isn't
[03:38:08] <Cork> rollingWolf: all js vendors have one
[03:38:12] <Cork> so nothing special about that
[03:41:14] <rollingWolf> Cork, So you wouldnt happen to know what its caleld? ducking microsoft nodejs didnt result in any decent results
[03:41:46] <Cork> rollingWolf: i don't think you will find much info about it before they release one
[03:41:53] <Cork> and it will most likely only work on windows so...
[03:42:03] <Cork> (i do not care)
[03:42:27] <rollingWolf> Cork, Ah ok well then :) thanks
[03:42:58] <Cork> it would be the day when microsoft developed software in the open
[03:43:12] <Cork> (heck it would be the day when google developed software in the open)
[03:43:34] <rollingWolf> Tbh I have bigger faith in microsoft than google
[03:43:42] <Cork> me too
[03:43:49] <Cork> though only by a hair
[03:44:03] <Cork> (and it still leaves both in "i don't trust you")
[04:37:30] <dimi1947> do you know of any site that uses in its forms jquery validate?I want to check something...
[04:38:57] <dimi1947> I found one...
[04:48:31] <codecutter> i have multiple textarea on page, how do i find the one that is focused on event 'keyup', $('.textarea) returns the first one
[04:54:57] <codecutter> nvm
[05:06:23] <chipyy> Hey, could i ask something? :D How can you see if referer string is from computer bot ?
[05:15:45] <Cork> chipyy: referer string?
[05:15:57] <Cork> chipyy: you can't, or are you talking about useragent?
[05:26:12] <chipyy>  i am reading about how to prevent spam from bots with usin referer string
[05:26:35] <Cork> how would that work?
[05:26:45] <Cork> referer strings is easy to add in a script
[05:26:49] <Cork> it won't help
[05:27:43] <Cork> it might block generic spam scripts that just don't use referers at all
[05:27:50] <chipyy> right now i am just watchin advanced refferer bot on youtube :D
[05:27:58] <Cork> (until enough sites use it then it won't work)
[05:27:59] <chipyy> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIHcHVwJ2T8
[05:27:59] <b-ot> (chipyy) Referrer Bot Advanced - length 3m 36s - 90 views - www.traffic-bots.com on 2014.08.11
[05:28:40] <Cork> my point is referrer is too low a fence
[05:28:53] <Cork> a better option is to require javascript actions to block them
[05:29:13] <Cork> or captcha (the later is needed if the bot is targeted)
[05:29:16] <chipyy> i see that it now that "hackers" already developed realy good programs
[05:29:37] <Cork> this isn't hackers
[05:29:41] <Cork> its scriptkiddis
[05:29:43] <chipyy> cork i am already using script + captcha, but i just some words about that referer strings
[05:29:57] <Cork> wome words about??
[05:30:00] <Cork> *some
[05:30:06] <Cork> not sure what you meant there
[05:30:38] <Cork> referrer is just a http header the client sends to indicate where it came from
[05:30:45] <chipyy> i will finish college and i have to do final product or how could i say
[05:30:51] <Cork> and it is far FAR from something you can trust
[05:31:00] <chipyy> and i will write a little bit about this referer strings
[05:31:20] <Cork> referrer is something you can use to see what url on your site it came from
[05:31:29] <chipyy> i know that yes
[05:31:35] <Cork> browsers are working on dropping specifics from cross domains
[05:31:37] <chipyy> but how does it look if it came from bot?
[05:31:39] <Cork> and only give you the domain name there
[05:31:45] <Cork> depends on the bot
[05:31:49] <Cork> it can look identical
[05:32:08] <Cork> it literally depends on if they added the header in the request or not
[05:32:13] <chipyy> yes , but let say that its bot made from rookie :D
[05:32:23] <Cork> uh...
[05:32:44] <Cork> is this a theoretical code project or something that is actually suppose to do something?
[05:32:55] <Cork> cause in practice it won't help
[05:33:01] <Cork> in theory it might work
[05:33:02] <chipyy> if i come from google to your site i guess the referer string would be : www.google.com?
[05:33:13] <Cork> depends on the client
[05:33:16] <Cork> and its settings
[05:33:29] <chipyy> ok, but let it be simple :D
[05:33:32] <Cork> some browsers give you nothing
[05:33:46] <Cork> as it leaks user history
[05:35:25] <chipyy> ok , so i think that i should end this discussion. As u made your arguments, i see that referer strings are unusefull in preventing bots
[05:35:48] <chipyy> so this method is dead we could say
[05:35:58] <Cork> referrers is half useless for anything
[05:36:10] <Cork> as browsers drop it from time to time
[05:36:18] <Cork> so you can use it as a hint, to try to help the user
[05:36:30] <Cork> but you can't never ever depend on it; even for linking inside the site
[05:36:52] <Cork> (i've experienced that first hand and had to fix bugs from it)
[05:37:17] <chipyy> ofcourse it could be just for help, but as u said i depend on JS and captcha...
[05:37:46] <Cork> also note both those aren't foolproof either
[05:37:56] <Cork> there are bots today that uses js too
[05:38:09] <Cork> and bots are getting better and better at parsing captchas
[05:38:37] <Cork> so it is an arms raise, where it is about making it more work then "my puny little site is worth" :)
[05:41:04] <chipyy> :D
[05:41:34] <chipyy> they are always developing some new scripts...
[05:42:46] <gambl0re> Cork are you from Cork
[05:42:51] <Cork> np
[05:42:54] <Cork> opps
[05:42:57] <Cork> *no
[05:43:12] <chipyy> did they already made script for solving captcha were is image and inside image numbers or letters , with some figures?
[05:43:23] <Cork> ya
[05:43:29] <Cork> that's easy
[05:43:33] <chipyy> realy? :D with OCR?
[05:43:44] <chipyy> or just script?
[05:43:50] <Cork> or just image cropping and comparing
[05:44:10] <chipyy> then what kind of captcha is atm safe? or isnt any ?
[05:44:32] <Cork> either ones where the text is tilted and curved
[05:44:46] <Cork> or things like googles captchas where you are to identify pictures
[05:45:01] <Cork> donno of anything that has broken that yet
[05:45:27] <chipyy> aha, are this google captchas free to use? :)
[05:45:33] <Cork> yes
[05:46:02] <chipyy> tnx for your infos, i should buy you a beer because u are so good :D
[05:46:02] <Cork> chipyy: also note simpler bots normally don't bother with captchas
[05:46:17] <Cork> it requires too much cpu time to be worth it
[05:46:23] <Cork> when they just spider the entire web
[05:46:33] <chipyy> even better :D
[05:46:35] <Cork> though just requiring js blocks those
[05:47:21] <Cork> so i normally don't bother with captchas until spam bots becomes a problem (it is a hassle for the user after all)
[05:49:35] <chipyy> i know that yes, so i am thinking if i should use google images or simplier with letters and numbers
[05:49:43] <chipyy> cork what about this: so you can spot robots by looking for referer strings that come from a remote website in order to limit their access to any email addresses on your page.
[05:50:02] <Cork> chipyy: ... you can't spot bots by referrers...
[05:50:08] <chipyy> i am asking my self what does it mean " remote website"
[05:50:33] <chipyy> how would i know that is remote site? :D
[05:50:36] <Cork> it just means the referrer string doesn't have your domain in the string
[05:50:40] <chipyy> but i guess that is imposible
[05:51:15] <chipyy> i kind'a dont understand that
[05:51:31] <Cork> one way some spam prevention works is by identifying characteristics in how the connection is created
[05:51:36] <chipyy> when he is on my site lets say www.mysite.com and what is his string?
[05:51:43] <Cork> to figure out if it is a "known client" and if it isn't block it
[05:51:51] <Cork> but those have tons of false positives
[05:52:09] <Cork> chipyy: it might be the url to the last page visited, or it might be nothing
[05:52:27] <Cork> or it might be a partial of the url last visited
[05:52:39] <Cork> but this is true for both bots and browsers
[05:52:49] <chipyy> so if i understand, the bot would still have in url window : iamrobot.com and he would be on my site?
[05:52:59] <Cork> uh window?
[05:53:03] <Cork> bots isn't browsers
[05:53:15] <Cork> its just code fetching the html page
[05:53:27] <chipyy> eh i was thinking that they colaborate with browsers
[05:53:29] <Cork> and most of the time regex searching through the response
[05:53:42] <Cork> that is the costly bots
[05:53:49] <Cork> but those are extreamly rare
[05:53:59] <Cork> and they still don't use a browser
[05:54:13] <Cork> but google search indexing bots runs js and navigates around
[05:54:30] <Cork> it parses based on rendering so it isn't only the html
[05:56:21] <chipyy> ah ok
[05:57:53] <chipyy> can i ask how long are you doing in JS and other program languages? :)
[05:58:16] <Cork> heh i started in late 80's :)
[05:58:36] <Cork> started with js in 96
[05:58:50] <Cork> or was it 95...
[05:58:52] <Cork> don't remember
[05:59:06] <Uhkis> good olde 90s and coffee cup html editor
[05:59:20] <Cork> and document.write was the hot stuff :)
[05:59:20] <chipyy> ah, so we could say that you are grandpa in programming :D
[05:59:44] <Cork> and homepage was the website creator of choice
[06:00:03] <Uhkis> homepage?
[06:00:15] <Cork> shit.. forgot the name...
[06:00:34] <Uhkis> you mean microsofts frontpage?
[06:00:39] <Cork> right
[06:00:41] <Cork> -_-'
[06:00:45] * Cork feels silly
[06:01:02] <Uhkis> wow, coffeecup is still alive :)
[06:01:03] <Cork> man i loathed that program
[06:01:58] <Cork> ya, and i suspect it has a decent userbase too
[06:02:12] <Cork> (coffeecup that is)
[06:02:32] <Uhkis> hey, coffeecup was awesome, it had "add snowfall" button :D
[06:02:52] <Cork> ugg.. don't remind me...
[06:03:20] <Cork> the let me make your computer into a water cooker button...
[06:04:02] <Uhkis> hahaha
[06:09:40] <rollingWolf> crane, Best viewed in (netscape|msie|any) in 800x600 ;)
[06:09:52] <Cork> lol
[06:10:06] <rollingWolf> Woops meant o say to you Cork
[06:10:14] <Uhkis> oh boy
[06:10:19] <Cork> ya, that was fun.., lot better then what we have now days though
[06:10:29] <Cork> where ppl straight out block the browsers
[06:10:30] <rollingWolf> Blinking animated "unders construction" gifs
[06:10:40] <Uhkis> rollingWolf: and spinning @ gifs!
[06:10:44] <Cork> ah RIP <blink>
[06:11:07] <rollingWolf> Uhkis, Pffft ... fast scrolling numbers to show "visits" ;)
[06:11:25] <rollingWolf> Hey I know!! Lets make a webring :D
[06:12:20] <Uhkis> well, visitor counters in general were 90s thing
[06:12:31] <rollingWolf> Uhkis,  :)
[06:12:53] <rollingWolf> and icq winning "worst site of the eyar" a couple of years in a row )
[06:14:06] * rollingWolf managed to install: dos, win 3.11, trumpet winsock, mirc, netscape 3.0, icq (which required you to install win32s first, which required 5MB free space during installation but about 3MB after) .. on an old 20-22MB hdd
[06:14:27] <rollingWolf> I had like .. 500KB free space?
[06:14:53] <chipyy> i dont know what are you talking about but sounds kind a funny :D
[06:15:09] <chipyy> but i can see now how young i am :D
[06:15:15] <rollingWolf> chipyy, Its a fucking miracle I managed to get all tghat running on that little space available
[06:15:20] <rollingWolf> sorry :(
[06:15:26] <silent_freak> Nostalgic trip man! :D
[06:15:27] <rollingWolf> Didnt mean to f--
[06:15:41] <Uhkis> my first computers hdd was huge, 3.2GB iirc
[06:15:45] <chipyy> its ok rollingWolf D
[06:15:54] <Cork> rollingWolf: hmm, i thought win3.11 and dos blow the 20 meg bounder by it self
[06:16:05] <chipyy> and i came in the game with 60gb i think :D
[06:16:16] <Cork> at least i remember having problems with having to remove parts of dos to get it to fit on my old 20mb disk :)
[06:16:20] <rollingWolf> Cork, Nah, but I really had to strip all the unneeded stuff. Like helpfiles and whatnot
[06:16:28] <Cork> ya
[06:16:39] <silent_freak> My first pc had like 32 MB of HDD. Had to offload stuff on floppy to make space.
[06:16:42] <chipyy> was it easy? :D
[06:16:44] <Cork> and now you can run win3.11 freely in a dosbox :D
[06:17:18] <Cork> silent_freak: my first had a wopping 15 mb :/
[06:17:26] <Cork> and win 2
[06:17:42] <Cork> moving windows ontop of each other; na, who needs that! ;D
[06:17:52] <rollingWolf> People claim im wrong, or outright lying, taht I managed to install win95 on an old 286. Im just trying to figure out how the heck I did it since 286 wasnt available "technically"
[06:17:54] <silent_freak> ha! I dont even remember the RAM if that ancient pc even had that. :P
[06:18:03] <rollingWolf> Boot took like 40minutes
[06:18:03] <Uhkis> chipyy: you have no idea how lucky you are, i've installed IE4 from 16 floppy disks
[06:18:12] <silent_freak> @Cork - DOS ftw
[06:18:22] <Cork> rollingWolf: win95 doesn't work on a none 486 computer
[06:18:42] <Cork> silent_freak: it was interesting hacking time
[06:18:46] <rollingWolf> Cork, it could do on a 386 iirc
[06:19:19] <chipyy> Uhkis: hehe :D, about that i agree with you
[06:19:30] <chipyy> i am leaving you, bye bye
[06:19:40] <Cork> rollingWolf: ya if it had dx
[06:19:47] <Cork> but not a straight 386
[06:19:50] <silent_freak> 386DX yes
[06:19:54] <silent_freak> See what I found - https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/138349
[06:19:58] <rollingWolf> Uhkis, Office 1997 on 20+ floppies . .First disk took more than 24hours :S
[06:19:59] <silent_freak> Min specs for Win 95
[06:20:00] <silent_freak> :D
[06:20:20] <rollingWolf> silent_freak, I know the "minspecs" of 95 and Im telling you i managed to install it on a 286
[06:20:29] <silent_freak> Win 95 was "REVOLUTIONARY" af
[06:20:35] <silent_freak> 286! No way.
[06:20:36] <rollingWolf> And im not alone, others have too if you duck it
[06:20:39] <Cork> rollingWolf: i think you remember wrong
[06:20:51] <Cork> cause you would basically have to patch it to do that
[06:21:37] <rollingWolf> Cork, If i remember correctly it was something like: dos4gw win.com (well it wasnt dos4gw but i just took as an example)
[06:22:13] <rollingWolf> Something about emulating a higher cpu by severly decreasign speed
[06:22:25] <rollingWolf> Like I said took like 40 minutes to boot into windows
[06:22:25] <Uhkis> rollingWolf: wordperfect from CD!! :D
[06:22:28] <silent_freak> Could be a modified "stripped-down" version? Man this statement seems so ironical.
[06:22:29] <silent_freak> :P
[06:22:49] <silent_freak> How will you further strip down Win 95?! :D
[06:23:00] <Cork> rollingWolf: hmm, you can't emulate parts of the 386 arch on a 286
[06:23:03] <rollingWolf> Uhkis, Hehehe, "cd" the luxury ;)
[06:23:18] <Cork> you can emulate a 486 on a 386 but not 386 on a 286
[06:23:22] * rollingWolf hands Uhkis a 100MB zipdisk
[06:24:00] <rollingWolf> Uhkis, Install slackware-zip on it ;)
[06:24:01] <Uhkis> rollingWolf: good thing we skipped that zipdisk year
[06:24:18] <Cork> ah, zipdisks
[06:24:27] <rollingWolf> zipslack? i dont remember what it was called, a stripped down slackware that would fit on a 100MB zipdisk
[06:24:33] <Uhkis> was it even a full year, zipdisks diede fast
[06:24:47] <Cork> it lost the hype fast
[06:24:54] <Cork> but it lived for many years
[06:25:07] <Cork> i would say 95-ish onto 98-99
[06:25:17] <rollingWolf> Heh, hehehe I remember reading about the improved development of CD drives in computer magaznies
[06:25:40] <rollingWolf> At the end you had like an ad saying: "Weve managed to get x16 speed" and then a issue later "we hit 18x"
[06:25:44] <rollingWolf> etc.etc.
[06:25:47] <Cork> and cdrom, cdr- cdr+ and cdram ;)
[06:25:54] <Uhkis> "burn cds at home" was a huge WOW moment back then
[06:26:12] <rollingWolf> Uhkis, I rmemeber buying my first dvd burner
[06:26:25] <rollingWolf> Cost like . . .less than 100usd at the time
[06:26:30] <Cork> me and my friends used to buy bulk packs of cdroms 500 packs for 80 sek a disk...
[06:26:37] <rollingWolf> Cork, :)
[06:26:42] <Cork> they where freaking expensive back then
[06:26:45] <silent_freak> I remember owning a re-writable CDs was a luxury. It was kind of pre-Flash storage convinience!
[06:27:01] <Cork> and branded disk cost ~500 sek here
[06:27:20] <Cork> anyway gtg
[06:27:25] <Uhkis> Cork: i bet cd-r's are even more expensive now
[06:27:26] <rollingWolf> I bought a soundblaster 1024 . With full duplex! So I could have my spaker and mic going at the same time
[06:27:43] <Cork> Uhkis: it isn't actually
[06:27:46] <Cork> you can still buy them
[06:27:58] <Cork> cd-ram is worse though
[06:27:59] <rollingWolf> Cork, Simma lugnt
[06:28:16] <Cork> cd-r and cd+r costs about 1 sek now days :)
[06:28:23] <Cork> rollingWolf: :)
[07:36:07] <hellyeah> is there a method in jquery for traversing all nodes in the dom?
[07:42:56] <Cork> hellyeah: depends on if you want them as a structure or just a list
[07:43:10] <Cork> $('*') will give you all elements
[07:43:31] <Cork> though you very VERY rarely want to actually do that though
[07:43:58] <Cork> if you actually need to walk the dom use a domwalker
[07:44:08] <hellyeah> hmm
[07:44:10] <hellyeah> yeah
[07:44:11] <Cork> *treewalker
[07:44:17] <hellyeah> i need to wal the dom
[07:44:17] <Cork> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/createTreeWalker
[07:44:29] <hellyeah> and get the "text" of every node
[07:44:37] <Cork> why?
[07:45:03] <hellyeah> hmm well
[07:46:12] <hellyeah> we will establish a relationship with text and our dictionary. Let say Text is england and out dictionary has something for england when user "select" an england it will show all what englang means to people.
[07:46:17] <hellyeah> i hope it is understandable
[07:46:33] <hellyeah> me and my friend has aim to do "data mining"
[07:46:40] <hellyeah> we are just at the beginning
[07:46:51] <hellyeah> so i didnt cover all details
[07:48:45] <hellyeah> hope it was understandable
[09:14:53] <kailido> how can I check if a div have a scrollbar ? i have a table with a fixed height, and when the rows go after, the scrollbar appears
[09:42:31] <z1haze_work> how do you write a delegated listener for hover() ?
[09:42:51] <Uhkis> with css
[09:43:02] <z1haze_work> lol
[09:43:23] <z1haze_work> seriously, i need a deletgated listener for mouseenter, mouseleave
[09:43:29] <z1haze_work> i cant figure it out
[09:44:44] <z1haze_work> i have $('body').on('mouseenter', '.olapic-item', function() { but how do i chain the mouseleave with that? can i just do .on('mouseleave', function() { and it will already be binded to the previous?
[09:47:45] <Cork> z1haze_work: yes
[09:48:03] <Cork> you can chain jquery method calls
[09:55:38] <z1haze_work> it didnt work for me
[09:56:11] <z1haze_work> i had to make a know new event handler with $('body').on('mouseleave', '.my-el', function() { ...
[09:56:20] <shoky_> you did something wrong, then
[09:56:29] <Cork> z1haze_work: $().on().on() works just fine
[09:56:39] <z1haze_work> even with delgated listeners
[09:56:44] <Cork> yes
[09:56:51] <z1haze_work> hmm
[09:56:54] <shoky_> a delegated listener is just a call to .on()
[09:57:11] <z1haze_work> dont know what i could have done wrong
[09:57:15] <Cork> delegation in this case is just that it preprocesses the event before it calls your callback
[09:57:23] <Cork> other then that there is no difference
[09:57:34] <z1haze_work> and that doesnt have to be passed into the second .on()?
[09:57:40] <shoky_> if you didn't put the child selector in the 2nd .on()  then you shouldn't expect the 2nd on() to be delegated
[09:57:58] <z1haze_work> oh ok
[09:58:03] <shoky_> first call doesn't affect the 2nd call, they are just 2 calls.
[09:58:16] <z1haze_work> so how to i bind to the body on the second call then
[09:58:19] <z1haze_work> thats where i got confused
[09:58:24] <shoky_> it's already binded to body
[09:58:27] <z1haze_work> oh
[09:58:32] <z1haze_work> gotcha
[10:33:43] <aro> is there a plugin that adds items to history when u click ajax links
[10:48:54] <aro> adds hash navigation to url bar too
[10:48:55] <aro> anything?
[10:52:32] <taplar> sounds like your after more of a framework than a plugin
[11:02:24] <aro> noo
[11:02:33] <aro> i just want something to change the address bar and update history
[11:02:36] <aro> is there anything?
[11:29:12] <subvhome> in moment.js... if i use "if (moment().isAfter(moment('6:00 AM', 'h:mm A'))) ... is that statement always true? or does it only count within a 24 hour period?
[11:31:00] <subvhome> oh wait.. i see that its including moment() which gives the complete string of todays date. so it will only reflect on today
[11:31:10] <subvhome> am i right?
[11:39:42] <z1haze_work> what might cause some type errors to coming from my jquery file loading from cdn? anything over 2.2.4 i get some sort of type error a.indexOf is not a function
[11:39:49] <z1haze_work> and i think 3.1 it said e.indexOf
[11:40:02] <robertmaxrees> z1haze bad code on your end.
[11:40:53] <z1haze_work> figured as much
[11:41:08] <z1haze_work> jquery is loaded before other stuff though
[11:41:15] <z1haze_work> why would the error call out in the jquery.js file
[11:41:29] <z1haze_work> or better yet, how do i find it?
[11:41:34] <robertmaxrees> because you're feeding it something that it can't figure out how to handle.
[11:41:37] <z1haze_work> they were still running jquery 1.11.1
[11:41:38] <robertmaxrees> usually it's a bad selector.
[11:41:45] <robertmaxrees> and 1.11 isn't too bad.
[11:41:45] <z1haze_work> and this is a brand new site.
[11:41:57] <robertmaxrees> the stack trace might be able to tell you more.
[11:42:08] <robertmaxrees> if you go back to 1.11, does the error go away?
[11:42:15] <z1haze_work> 2.2.4 it goes away
[11:42:24] <robertmaxrees> https://jquery.com/upgrade-guide/3.0/
[11:42:34] <robertmaxrees> i'd check the breaking changes.
[11:42:50] <z1haze_work> eh i will at some point dont have time to now unfortunately
[11:42:57] <robertmaxrees> lol
[11:43:01] <z1haze_work> but hey man over the past weekend i dug into vuejs and its so easy
[11:43:10] <robertmaxrees> cool.
[11:43:11] <z1haze_work> built a whole spa in 2 days
[11:43:17] <z1haze_work> so much easier than backbone
[11:43:35] <robertmaxrees> i don't like the way vue handles some things, but lots of people like it.
[11:44:08] <z1haze_work> i wouldnt have a clue at this point, all i know is how easy it was to use
[11:44:16] <robertmaxrees> sure
[11:44:17] <z1haze_work> but i also didnt have to do any model crap
[11:44:26] <robertmaxrees> lol
[11:44:40] <z1haze_work> just fetch the json from the server, and set the data
[11:44:42] <z1haze_work> voila
[11:44:51] <robertmaxrees> and techniquue, you're still dealing with models.
[11:45:15] <robertmaxrees> vue just mashes them into "ViewModels"
[11:45:33] <z1haze_work> in a sense i suppose, it has a data object which i gues is the model
[11:45:43] <robertmaxrees> vue literally calls them viewmodels.
[11:45:49] <robertmaxrees> that's what their documentation refers to them as.
[11:45:53] <robertmaxrees> ;)\
[11:45:54] <z1haze_work> maybe i just havent done it
[11:46:01] <taplar> a map's a map
[11:46:18] <robertmaxrees> boom
[11:46:19] <z1haze_work> i just Vue.extend() or Vue.component, make my components, set the methods for each one, and the data, etc
[11:46:22] <decx> you did vue-cli?
[11:46:26] <z1haze_work> no
[11:46:34] <decx> try it out, the devserver is banging
[11:46:36] <z1haze_work> just scraped the surface really
[11:46:50] <z1haze_work> i struggled with the other js frameworks for a while and this just was so easy for me
[11:46:57] <z1haze_work> i use laravel for a backend, and it meshes nicely
[11:46:58] <decx> proxy relative adresses to a backend, it's awesome
[11:47:31] <z1haze_work> used that vue-resource, and the vue-rotuer, and some package called vueify which made it nice to create the view files separately
[11:47:58] <decx> yeah vue-cli has the whole setup with tests, devserver, babel and .vue files
[11:48:04] <decx> import to your hearts content
[11:49:05] <decx> and hotreloading without hassle
[11:49:22] <decx> even keeping state
[11:49:23] <decx> neato
[11:49:25] <z1haze_work> i will try that this weekend if i am able to
[11:51:16] <tsukasadt> Could anyone take a look at my use of $.getJSON using 1.7.2 (I have no choice in the version, third-party provider)? For some reason, all attempts come up as a failure, even when the XHR finishes loading. It's kinda hard to test as the system it's written to query is access restricted, but here's the code: https://jsfiddle.net/7o4cxkdy/
[11:52:19] <robertmaxrees> tsukasadt are you getting errors or...?
[11:52:32] <tsukasadt> No errors.
[11:52:41] <decx> ah, the old window.location indexOf router ^^
[11:52:48] <robertmaxrees> so you're just always hitting your fail blocks?
[11:53:07] <tsukasadt> Using an authorized user, I get no errors, but an unauthorized user gets a 401 error, as it should.
[11:53:20] <tsukasadt> Yes, for some reason it's always going to .fail().
[11:53:29] <robertmaxrees> what's the status code for auth'd users?
[11:53:38] <tsukasadt> decx, do you have an better suggestion for that?
[11:54:06] <decx> dont worry about it until your request works
[11:54:18] <decx> but router.js was pretty good the last time i used it with jquery
[11:54:26] <robertmaxrees> tsukasadt i might do .fail(function(jqHXR, status, errorThrown) { console.log(textStatus}; console.log(errorThrown); });
[11:54:31] <robertmaxrees> see what those tell youy.
[11:54:45] <robertmaxrees> *you
[11:56:00] <kryptynasium> Any recommendations for a javascript-based calendar - need to use it for commercial project - this one looks appealing - https://github.com/Serhioromano/bootstrap-calendar anything better?
[11:56:21] <tsukasadt> robertmaxrees, it errs Uncaught ReferenceError: textStatus is not defined
[11:56:39] <robertmaxrees> wat
[11:56:45] <taplar> 'status' is on the args
[11:56:49] <robertmaxrees> sorry
[11:56:55] <robertmaxrees> that first console log should just be status
[11:56:58] <robertmaxrees> not textStatus
[11:57:40] <tsukasadt> It prints a blank line.
[11:58:04] <robertmaxrees> what's the response you're getting from the server?
[11:58:46] <tsukasadt> 200 on the first, 302 on the second
[11:59:00] <robertmaxrees> and you've validated the response body?
[11:59:27] <robertmaxrees> brb
[12:00:11] <tsukasadt> All I need is for it to verify the the response is not unauthorized.
[12:02:13] <tsukasadt> Any ideas?
[12:02:21] <robertmaxrees> just got back.
[12:02:24] <robertmaxrees> did you validate the response?
[12:02:59] <tsukasadt> Sorry, didn't notice you were d/ced. All I need is for it to verify that the response is not unauthorized. Anything else is irrelevant for its purpose.
[12:03:15] <robertmaxrees> so $.getJSON relies on a valid JSON response.
[12:03:18] <robertmaxrees> hence the question.
[12:03:39] <robertmaxrees> i might use $.ajax() if the actual response value isn't important.
[12:03:59] <tsukasadt> Okay, so I should use something else. The page doesn't return JSON, I was just adapting someone else's code. ^^'
[12:04:08] <robertmaxrees> that's your problem then.
[12:04:14] <robertmaxrees> just swap to $.ajax()
[12:04:22] <tsukasadt> Thank you, I'm VERY new to jQuery. ^^'
[12:04:49] <robertmaxrees> sure.  learn.jquery.com is a really good place to start btw.
[12:14:30] <tsukasadt> robertmaxress, Thank you, switching to $.ajax() worked perfectly!
[12:14:35] <robertmaxrees> cool.
[12:15:15] <taplar> so he's just after an auth check?
[12:15:23] <robertmaxrees> prolly
[12:15:30] <tsukasadt> Basically.
[12:15:32] <taplar> could he use method 'head' with ajax?
[12:15:38] <robertmaxrees> could try.
[12:21:58] <decx> let's get head alright
[12:22:34] <taplar> hmm, decx would be for that
[13:42:49] <plamb_> does closest select siblings
[13:42:52] <plamb_> or only parents
[13:42:59] <robertmaxrees> the first ancestor.
[13:46:18] <plamb_> is there an IRC channel for the jquery validate plugin
[13:46:29] <robertmaxrees> nope.  you can try asking here though.
[13:46:40] <plamb_> i want my error <label> to push the containing <ul> down
[13:46:55] <plamb_> instead it sees it cant fit there and inserts next to the input field instead of beneath
[13:47:24] <plamb_> i mean, i "think" thats what is happening
[13:47:34] <plamb_> all my other inputs it inserts at the bottom of the <input>
[13:47:47] <plamb_> then the last one it inserts to the right
[13:47:55] <robertmaxrees> sounds like a css problem maybe?
[13:48:12] <plamb_> AH
[13:48:29] <plamb_> how do i set all the error's to display:block
[13:48:33] <aro> laravel sucks
[13:48:38] <plamb_> error.css("display","block") ?
[13:48:48] <aro> are there any plugins that will alter the history/change the url in the address bar?
[13:48:53] <robertmaxrees> plamb_ why not use basic css instead?
[13:49:23] <plamb_> good call
[13:51:33] <plamb_> does anyone know the rule for requiring no spaces
[13:51:40] <plamb_> for jquery validation
[13:51:44] <plamb_> the name of it
[13:51:50] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[13:52:21] <robertmaxrees> you mean noSpace: true ?
[13:52:25] <plamb_> yeah
[13:52:26] <plamb_> hmm
[13:52:30] <plamb_> thats how i defined it...
[13:52:59] <plamb_> Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'call' of undefined.  Exception occurred when checking element clusterName, check the 'noSpace' method.
[13:53:31] <plamb_> oh i need to include some additional methods file eh
[13:53:50] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[13:55:36] <plamb_> damn still got that exception
[13:55:55] <aro> are there any history/address bar plugins?
[13:56:14] <plamb_> robertmaxrees: does this look right
[13:56:16] <plamb_> http://pastebin.com/D2acwwBX
[13:56:25] <robertmaxrees> aro the basic history api is pretty easy to use.
[13:57:08] <robertmaxrees> plamb_ should be fine.  make sure you're including things in the right order?
[13:57:31] <plamb_> should additional-methods come before jquery.validate
[13:57:37] <plamb_> oh wait
[13:57:38] <plamb_> i see a type
[13:57:41] <plamb_> typo
[13:57:59] <plamb_> sdfsiodjfisj
[13:58:06] <robertmaxrees> pretty sure it's jquery, jquery validate, and then the additional methods.
[14:03:17] <aro> what do i use to change the address bar url?
[14:03:38] <robertmaxrees> using pushstates or just going to a different page?
[14:04:03] <aro> well, i didnt want to use a fixed url
[14:04:07] <aro> because that would break
[14:04:10] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[14:04:16] <aro> i just want to use hashes or something
[14:04:18] <robertmaxrees> are you looking to actually take the user to a new page?
[14:04:30] <robertmaxrees> so window.location.hash is how you manage hashes.
[14:04:36] <aro> well when a user goes to site.com/#/stuffhere/343
[14:04:51] <aro> it will basically load the index, and load that data via ajax at /stuffhere/343
[14:04:52] <robertmaxrees> sounds like you want a router then.
[14:05:08] <robertmaxrees> you using any frontend frameworks?
[14:05:14] <aro> just a thing i wrote
[14:05:27] <robertmaxrees> then yeah, read/set window.location.hash
[14:05:29] <aro> nothing to write home about
[14:05:43] <aro> can i use that in conjunction with pushState?
[14:05:45] <aro> or whatever it was
[14:05:46] <aro> history
[14:05:55] <robertmaxrees> you use one or the other.
[14:06:03] <robertmaxrees> the history api is if you want to modify the entire url, not just the hash.
[14:06:06] <robertmaxrees> you don't want tht in this case.
[14:06:18] <aro> but i want to preserve the nav history
[14:06:31] <aro> i dotn want someone to click through the site then hit back and be taken straight to login page
[14:06:44] <robertmaxrees> setting the window hash should work like you want it to.
[14:06:50] <aro> okay
[14:07:19] <robertmaxrees> you'll have to hook into https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowEventHandlers/onhashchange for when the user clicks back/forward.
[14:07:35] <aro> who is that dude loves jquery almost as much as he loves himself
[14:07:38] <aro> ben alman
[14:07:38] <aro> thats it
[14:07:46] <robertmaxrees> wut
[14:07:50] <aro> he had something that did something like that
[14:07:53] <aro> ya
[14:08:04] <robertmaxrees> i wouldn't say he's like that.
[14:08:13] <robertmaxrees> and he did have a project like that.  it's pretty old though.
[14:08:19] <aro> cowboy or something
[14:08:36] <robertmaxrees> yeah. i know who you're talking about.
[14:09:22] <plamb_> posted my question here robertmaxrees
[14:09:23] <plamb_> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/39376609/jquery-validation-plugin-cannot-read-property-call-of-undefined
[14:09:28] <plamb_> with the relevant details
[14:09:34] <robertmaxrees> i already answered..
[14:09:38] <robertmaxrees> brb
[14:09:42] <plamb_> yeah it still doesnt work :(
[14:17:04] <plamb_> well heres an article from 2011 saying you have to define it yourself
[14:17:06] <plamb_> http://bookofzeus.com/articles/jquery/jquery-validator-adding-a-no-space-validation/
[14:18:26] <plamb_> oh wow
[14:18:29] <plamb_> its "nowhitespace"
[14:20:56] <hellyeah> yo
[15:53:54] <Aljone_1> hey guys i need some advice http://paste.ee/p/lEhiz#LJL7Itv0VZWeB8KF2vg30Thb5E2psV0k
[15:54:52] <Aljone_1> im using jsonp to load my widget , as u can see i have an alert inside the success function which is not triggeting, i also past there my data.php file so u can see what returning back from it, i verified the and i see the ajax triggerd and the data return properly but still no alert
[15:57:35] <ngharo> success: mycallback = function(data) { should just be success: function(data) {
[15:58:03] <ngharo> also you dont have to add the callback= arg in the url if you specify jsonp
[15:58:38] <Aljone> ok
[15:58:43] <Aljone> let me remove it and check
[15:59:24] <Aljone> still no trigger
[15:59:27] <Aljone> no alert
[16:00:07] <robertmaxrees> what's the actual response coming back?
[16:00:30] <Aljone> the content of the data.php as u can see in my paste below
[16:00:35] <Aljone> ofc without the php part
[16:00:35] <robertmaxrees> lol
[16:00:39] <robertmaxrees> the actual raw data.
[16:00:40] <Aljone> just the mycallback(...
[16:00:58] <robertmaxrees> check the network tab.
[16:01:06] <robertmaxrees> see what you're actually gettin gback.
[16:01:08] <robertmaxrees> *getting
[16:01:09] <Aljone> yes
[16:01:10] <Aljone> i see
[16:01:15] <Aljone> mycallback({....})
[16:01:50] <robertmaxrees> alright.
[16:02:29] <Aljone> so where is my error exactly
[16:02:45] <robertmaxrees> why not make a fiddle?
[16:03:03] <Aljone> i can but how would it help?
[16:03:13] <robertmaxrees> you can simulate the ajxa call.
[16:03:31] <hellyeah> people can help you more
[16:03:32] <Aljone> its all on my localhost
[16:03:33] <robertmaxrees> and play with it there.
[16:03:40] <robertmaxrees> so replicate in jsfiddle Aljone
[16:03:44] <robertmaxrees> you can emulate the ajax request.
[16:03:46] <hellyeah> it is interactive environment
[16:04:09] <Aljone> thatok wait
[16:04:13] <hellyeah> Aljone:  robertmaxrees is king and taplar use that chance
[16:04:20] <robertmaxrees> lol
[16:04:28] <hellyeah> figuratively :D
[16:04:49] <hellyeah> also decx and shoky_
[16:04:53] <hellyeah> :D:D:D
[16:04:59] <robertmaxrees> for what it's worth you're not using jsonp correctly there Aljone
[16:05:12] <taplar> someone say my name?
[16:06:00] <hellyeah> me
[16:06:20] <hellyeah> you are listening dj hellyeah
[16:06:39] <taplar> lol
[16:06:58] <hellyeah> taplar:  not busy day i guess
[16:07:07] <taplar> it is, i'm still lurking though
[16:07:28] <hellyeah> good time with lurking
[16:07:28] <robertmaxrees> most people's client's notify them when they get mentioned.
[16:07:40] <robertmaxrees> so when you use their name they get a sound or something else telling them.
[16:07:41] <taplar> yeah i get a red number on my tab title
[16:07:51] <taplar> since it's a web irc
[16:07:58] <hellyeah> hmm
[16:07:59] <Aljone> https://jsfiddle.net/pzstpn6s/
[16:08:02] <Aljone> there we go
[16:08:28] <Aljone> ok now https error
[16:08:30] <Aljone> bahh
[16:08:41] <hellyeah> you can remove s
[16:08:42] <robertmaxrees> uh.
[16:08:55] <Aljone> but my host is without https
[16:08:56] <robertmaxrees> this has nothing to do with what you showed up.
[16:09:01] <robertmaxrees> *us
[16:09:10] <Aljone> yes i know its the jsfiddle thing
[16:09:18] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[16:09:27] <robertmaxrees> you know you can emulate ajax requests on jsfiddle, right?
[16:10:19] <arc_> how?
[16:10:22] <Aljone> yes ok let me change it
[16:10:24] <robertmaxrees> http://doc.jsfiddle.net/use/echo.html#jsonp
[16:10:26] <ngharo> Aljone: http://jsfiddle.net/0vnzxsqr/
[16:10:28] <ngharo> look at the console
[16:10:40] <arc_> interesting
[16:10:55] <robertmaxrees> oh.
[16:10:56] <robertmaxrees> hah
[16:11:03] <robertmaxrees> ngharo ftw
[16:11:12] <robertmaxrees> your response isn't valid alji
[16:11:28] <Aljone> https://jsfiddle.net/pzstpn6s/1/
[16:11:30] <Aljone> hows that
[16:11:49] <ngharo> Aljone: send your output through PHP's json_encode() rather than making your own json
[16:11:58] <robertmaxrees> ^^^^
[16:12:07] <taplar> fo sho
[16:12:17] <Aljone> hmm wait
[16:12:21] <ngharo> also pay attention to your javascript console. always.
[16:12:25] <Aljone> no i just think there is bug
[16:12:26] <robertmaxrees> ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
[16:12:37] <robertmaxrees> Aljone your response data is the wrong format.
[16:12:38] <robertmaxrees> not valid.
[16:17:45] <Aljone> ok im checking
[16:18:52] <Aljone> what about now
[16:19:08] <robertmaxrees> did you look at your console?
[16:19:46] <robertmaxrees> http://www.scenearchive.com/widget/data.php?UID=TEXT no
[16:19:50] <robertmaxrees> this is not valid js
[16:20:19] <Aljone> ok sorry refresh
[16:20:28] <Aljone> UID=TEXT its ok
[16:20:33] <robertmaxrees> still invalid.
[16:20:38] <Aljone> but thats GET param
[16:20:44] <robertmaxrees> are you using the json encode he told you to use?
[16:20:44] <Aljone> whats invalid with that?
[16:20:56] <Aljone> my response is JSON
[16:21:00] <robertmaxrees> thgat's not valid json.
[16:21:05] <robertmaxrees> you have linebreaks in the middle of a string.
[16:21:12] <robertmaxrees> those aren't valid.
[16:21:15] <Aljone> you mean the \n
[16:21:17] <robertmaxrees> no.
[16:21:21] <robertmaxrees> i mean the actual carriage returns.
[16:21:29] <Aljone> did you see the last version?
[16:21:36] <robertmaxrees> at http://www.scenearchive.com/widget/data.php?UID=TEXT ?
[16:21:36] <robertmaxrees> yes
[16:21:43] <robertmaxrees> needs to be one line.
[16:21:50] <Aljone> last return is that http://paste.ee/p/b5nRy#aNTZ2AuThKo7sLEQ8HVa9fCUP6wJuD1U
[16:21:59] <Aljone> i think u look at older version
[16:22:02] <robertmaxrees> that is not what i'm seeing at http://www.scenearchive.com/widget/data.php?UID=TEXT
[16:22:17] <robertmaxrees> https://paste.ee/p/b5nRy#aNTZ2AuThKo7sLEQ8HVa9fCUP6wJuD1U should work.
[16:22:32] <Aljone> check agaoin
[16:22:46] <Aljone> cuz its not working
[16:22:48] <robertmaxrees> http://www.scenearchive.com/widget/data.php?UID=TEXT is the same.
[16:22:59] <Aljone> no alert
[16:23:10] <robertmaxrees> what's the url you're hitting to get your data?
[16:23:22] <Aljone> http://www.scenearchive.com/widget/data.php?UID=TEXT <
[16:23:30] <Aljone> if u view source u will seee its ONE line
[16:24:19] <robertmaxrees> ah, maybe a bad header.
[16:24:53] <robertmaxrees> and look at your console again
[16:25:11] <Aljone> what header do i need?
[16:25:11] <robertmaxrees> your issue is that your server is supposed to use whatever it's given for the callback nam,e
[16:25:43] <robertmaxrees> don't worry about that part.
[16:26:22] <Aljone> ok so again why its not triggering?
[16:26:31] <robertmaxrees> "your issue is that your server is supposed to use whatever it's given for the callback name"
[16:26:34] <robertmaxrees> :)
[16:26:41] <robertmaxrees> open your console and you'll see the error.
[16:26:57] <Aljone> i dont see error
[16:27:11] <robertmaxrees> with your console open, re-run the fiddle.
[16:27:31] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/0vnzxsqr/ this shows "mycallback is not defined"
[16:27:52] <Aljone> i dont see that
[16:27:53] <Aljone> weird
[16:27:58] <Aljone> im using crome
[16:28:00] <robertmaxrees> you're probably filtering it out then.
[16:28:15] <robertmaxrees> but you need to fix the way your server handles the callback name,
[16:28:38] <Aljone> how
[16:28:47] <robertmaxrees> ...
[16:29:19] <robertmaxrees> your server needs to use the callback name that you give it in the js.
[16:29:25] <Aljone> and what about the filtering i dont understand why i dont see that error
[16:29:57] <robertmaxrees> (shrug) check your config and make sure it's not hiding things.
[16:30:12] <Aljone> i added data.php?callback=mycallback&UID and its working
[16:30:25] <robertmaxrees> lol
[16:30:34] <robertmaxrees> right.
[16:30:39] <Aljone> :)
[16:30:40] <robertmaxrees> because you told jquery what the callback name is.
[16:30:44] <robertmaxrees> i'd fix your server instead.
[16:30:49] <Aljone> hahah
[16:31:01] <robertmaxrees> becuase otherwise you're masking the actual bug.
[16:32:14] <Aljone> thanks guys
[17:36:35] <ABM_Dan> If I create a custom event, how do I feed it a "default" method that gets called after all the subscriber events are called?
[17:37:16] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[17:37:35] <ABM_Dan> take the click event on an a element.
[17:38:00] <ABM_Dan> the default is something like window.location(a.href) //pseudocode
[17:38:13] <robertmaxrees> so you're trigger()ing your own event?
[17:38:13] <ABM_Dan> you can go like e.preventDefault() to stop it
[17:38:32] <ABM_Dan> well yes, if you don't trigger custom events they just don't happen.
[17:38:45] <robertmaxrees> you have to bind your own listener.
[17:38:52] <robertmaxrees> like, there's no creating a "default"
[17:39:06] <ABM_Dan> Ok, how do I make sure that one listener
[17:39:14] <ABM_Dan> "happens" after all the others?
[17:40:11] <robertmaxrees> by binding it after all the others.
[17:40:31] <ABM_Dan> Hm. That's gonna be challenging.
[17:40:39] <ABM_Dan> In the source it will likely come first.
[17:41:48] <robertmaxrees> there's no real way to ensure that the first bound handler will fire last.
[17:42:10] <robertmaxrees> you might be able to hit the private API and munge with the queues but I'd really avoid that.
[17:43:25] <ABM_Dan> https://github.com/nickyleach/jQuery.bindLast 6 years old, yay.
[17:45:13] <robertmaxrees> heh.
[17:45:28] <ABM_Dan> That's too bad tho.
[17:45:39] <ABM_Dan> a default for custom events would be so useful.
[17:45:47] <robertmaxrees> relying on the order of event handlers firing is sort of a bad idea imo.
[17:45:52] <robertmaxrees> but i'm sure you'll disagree ;)
[17:46:09] <robertmaxrees> your handler should really explicitly handle all of that yourself.
[17:46:35] <ABM_Dan> Oh, I don't want to muck with the order, but say I have a "deleteElement" event that deletes an element.
[17:46:48] <ABM_Dan> In some situations I'm ok with the default of $el.remove();
[17:47:13] <robertmaxrees> it sounds like you're proxying logic through the dom that should really be contained within your view.
[17:47:34] <robertmaxrees> or whatever construct you're using.
[17:47:38] <ABM_Dan> some other situations I want to do stuff like $el.addClass('remove-animation'); settimeout(....$el.remove()..);
[17:47:56] <robertmaxrees> yeah, i wouldn't be using custom events in that case.
[17:48:11] <ABM_Dan> What would you use?
[17:48:29] <robertmaxrees> i'd directly call those functions instead.
[17:48:36] <robertmaxrees> and pass them the element.
[17:49:12] <robertmaxrees> far easier to debug down the road if you do it that way - treating the dom event model like a pubsub gets really complex really quick.
[17:49:17] <ABM_Dan> But that's far less modular.
[17:49:33] <robertmaxrees> how so?
[17:49:40] <ABM_Dan> Say I wanted some form response to trigger the deletion
[17:50:01] <ABM_Dan> and then for some instances of the form response, have a custom callback for the deletion
[17:50:20] <ABM_Dan> That seems exactly what pubsub is made for.
[17:50:28] <robertmaxrees> err.
[17:50:40] <robertmaxrees> pubsub is a bad model is part of my argument.
[17:50:52] <robertmaxrees> and how is directly calling the method not modular.
[17:51:32] <ABM_Dan> I don't know which method you're referring to.
[17:51:45] <robertmaxrees> the code you want to run in response to firing the event.
[17:52:00] <robertmaxrees> you're basically replacing a direct function call by using the DOM to do it instead.
[17:52:16] <ABM_Dan> But they are not coupled
[17:52:31] <robertmaxrees> coupling in this case is not necessarily a bad thing.
[17:52:46] <ABM_Dan> It is in my environment.
[17:52:59] <robertmaxrees> and it's like mega coupled.
[17:53:03] <robertmaxrees> you're just hitting an API.
[17:53:27] <robertmaxrees> just speaking frome experience, pubsubs get really convoluted really quickly.
[17:55:10] <ABM_Dan> I still don't know what alternative I could use for decoupling.
[17:55:14] <robertmaxrees> flux.
[17:55:18] <ABM_Dan> And decoupling is something I very much need.
[17:55:33] <robertmaxrees> who do you need it to that extreme though?
[17:56:09] <ABM_Dan> Because it's causing issues where we need to handle stuff in a million places, and there's a ton of repetition, and it's hell to maintain.
[17:56:23] <robertmaxrees> why is there so much repetition?
[17:56:54] <ABM_Dan> because our designer hates us and wants everything to be a little bit different from everything else.
[17:57:03] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[17:57:15] <robertmaxrees> what does your designer have to do with your software archicture?
[17:57:28] <ABM_Dan> and so we have element a with behavior c and element b with behavior d, but sometimes element a will have behavior d.
[17:58:33] <robertmaxrees> that's pretty standard.
[18:00:18] <ABM_Dan> In the end pub/sub is at the core of the DOM, it's something we use necessarily, I'm just trying to extend it, because it makes sense not to use two patterns where we can use one.
[18:00:40] <robertmaxrees> i very much disagree with everythign after the first comma :)
[18:00:49] <robertmaxrees> well, okay, second comma haha
[18:01:01] <ABM_Dan> Ok, I was confused, you don't listen to events?
[18:01:14] <robertmaxrees> only for the basic native browser stuff.
[18:01:30] <robertmaxrees> we're working on abating all pubsub code from our codebase.
[18:01:45] <taplar> https://github.com/taplar/jquery-pubsub
[18:01:54] * taplar dances
[18:02:35] <ABM_Dan> Sadly, I'm not there, I'm not sure how to use most of the information you gave me.
[18:02:55] <robertmaxrees> it's an architectural change.
[18:03:02] <robertmaxrees> what're you using for your views?
[18:03:24] <ABM_Dan> Nothing specific, just manually written code.
[18:03:32] <robertmaxrees> heh
[18:03:35] <ABM_Dan> We don't have a frontend templating/view thing.
[18:03:46] <taplar> i like handlebars
[18:04:00] <robertmaxrees> react
[18:04:02] <robertmaxrees> backbone.
[18:04:03] <robertmaxrees> etc.
[18:04:19] <robertmaxrees> vue - sounds like you're solving problems these have already solved.
[18:04:41] <ABM_Dan> We probably are.
[18:04:56] <ABM_Dan> I'm pushing for improvements in the system.
[18:05:24] <ABM_Dan> I'd love to be able to drop some react in the system, but I'm not versed enough and don't have the authority to push for this change.
[18:05:44] <robertmaxrees> you shouldn't need much authority beyond "i've lived in the system for at least 3 months"
[18:05:45] <ABM_Dan> Switching to a pub/sub version using custom events is already an improvement on what we have.
[18:05:47] <robertmaxrees> (shrug)
[18:05:56] <robertmaxrees> i'm just looking at your future.
[18:06:55] <taplar> if you play around with that pubsub plugin, i'd love feedback, :)
[18:07:17] <ABM_Dan> taplar: That seems very close to what you can already do with $.Callback tho.
[18:08:17] <ABM_Dan> robertmaxrees: The only thing I was considering is Transparency.
[18:08:31] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[18:08:33] <ABM_Dan> Anything more would require us to restructure a lot of our infrastructure.
[18:08:38] <ABM_Dan> http://leonidas.github.io/transparency/
[18:08:48] <robertmaxrees> you could drop in backbone views today and not really need to do very much.
[18:08:57] <robertmaxrees> you can use them next to everything else you've currently got.
[18:09:08] <ABM_Dan> I'd have to study them.
[18:09:17] <ABM_Dan> And technically I'm not the frontend dev here.
[18:09:30] <ABM_Dan> And yes, this is comedically inefficient.
[18:09:48] <robertmaxrees> heh
[18:10:07] <robertmaxrees> so then who decided on the convention?
[18:11:01] <ABM_Dan> I'm proposing to use a dom-like system.
[18:11:16] <ABM_Dan> Currently, we're manually calling stuff from everywhere.
[18:11:19] <robertmaxrees> err.
[18:11:21] <robertmaxrees> hold up.
[18:11:27] <ABM_Dan> my bad
[18:11:30] <robertmaxrees> lol so you can't propose changes but you can propose changes?
[18:11:41] <ABM_Dan> I can lobby, but I only have so much clout.
[18:11:48] <ABM_Dan> They need to seem small and inexpensive.
[18:11:52] <robertmaxrees> i'd spend that time lobbying for backbone or react.
[18:12:08] <ABM_Dan> If I say backbone or react, I mention a Big Thing.
[18:12:10] <robertmaxrees> becuase this change will lead to major technical debt down the road.
[18:13:27] <ABM_Dan> It's still gonna be cleaner than what we have at the moment.
[18:13:33] <robertmaxrees> i'd disagree.
[18:13:34] <robertmaxrees> but meh.
[18:13:46] <ABM_Dan> tbh, I don't think you would.
[18:13:52] <robertmaxrees> i would.
[18:14:02] <ABM_Dan> Yes, pubsub might be bad, trust me, there's worse.
[18:14:06] <robertmaxrees> lol
[18:14:13] <robertmaxrees> i work in coldfusion codebases, yo.
[18:14:14] <ABM_Dan> I'm trying to upgrade to bad.
[18:14:16] <robertmaxrees> i've seen how bad it can get.
[18:18:16] <ABM_Dan> If it helps, I'm trying to carve out some time at home to study React.
[18:18:26] <ABM_Dan> Hopefully it will lead somewhere.
[18:40:30] <ABM_Dan> http://benalman.com/news/2010/03/jquery-special-events/#api-default
[18:40:38] <ABM_Dan> It's apparently quite easy to do.
[18:41:16] <robertmaxrees> that article is like 6 years old fwiw.
[19:05:59] <ABM_Dan> proof of concept: http://codepen.io/anon/pen/LRVzbP?editors=1111
[19:06:05] <robertmaxrees> lol
[19:06:19] <ABM_Dan> Not stoked about having to tackle jQuery.event.special but that's that.
[19:06:22] <robertmaxrees> oh you guys are using coffeescript?
[19:06:38] <ABM_Dan> No, you're imagining it.
[19:06:47] <robertmaxrees> really duder?
[19:07:05] <ABM_Dan> It was a pretty redundant question.
[19:07:16] <robertmaxrees> no need to be a dick about it.
[19:07:47] <ABM_Dan> My bad.
[19:08:13] <robertmaxrees> that project even being maintained anymore.
[19:08:55] <ABM_Dan> https://github.com/jashkenas/coffeescript
[19:09:02] <ABM_Dan> Not super active, but not dead
[19:09:04] <robertmaxrees> weird.
[19:56:27] <gambl0re> hi robert..
[19:57:08] <robertmaxrees> sup
[19:57:50] <gambl0re> hows going?
[19:58:09] <aro> when using the history api - is there a way to pushState to the address bar with a hash?
[19:58:16] <aro> it keeps stripping it out
[19:58:18] <aro> for some reason
[19:58:24] <robertmaxrees> not that i'm aware of aro.
[19:58:56] <aro> well thats just peachy
[19:59:19] <aro> none of these are actual urls
[19:59:30] <aro> but they tell the JS engine we have how to load the resources
[19:59:37] <aro> so i keep getting 404's
[20:01:46] <robertmaxrees> you'll need to setup your server to respond to those correctly.
[20:01:53] <aro> yeah well we cant do that
[20:01:58] <robertmaxrees> why?
[20:02:11] <aro> because its a websphere instance and it takes all kinds of stupid parameters
[20:02:27] <taplar> websphere blows
[20:02:29] <aro> so we are just serving with a base index.html page
[20:02:37] <robertmaxrees> sounds like any request should load up a basic verion of the page that then inits everything else as necessary
[20:02:46] <aro> and wrote this JS thing to do it all
[20:02:50] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, you're kind of SOL.
[20:04:20] <aro> can you couple it with location.hash
[20:04:44] <robertmaxrees> "couple"?
[20:04:58] <aro> i want my urls in the address bar to appear after a hash
[20:05:25] <robertmaxrees> you can setup using that, though you'll want to build out your own history management and stuff.
[20:05:38] <aro> how do you do that? thats what i want mostly is the history management
[20:06:01] <robertmaxrees> actually maybe not?  i'd experiment a little.
[20:10:57] <robertmaxrees> any reason you aren't using an spa library of some kind here?
[20:11:24] <taplar> frameworks are for quitters, yo. ;)
[20:11:28] <robertmaxrees> hahahaha
[20:13:19] <taplar> it's the old saying, ya know?  if you want something done right, you get out your chisel and you make the wheel yourself
[20:13:47] <taplar> washington said that i believe
[20:15:44] * taplar contemplates trying to make react work on his site
[20:39:12] <gambl0re> i dont think people use jquery anymore
[20:40:21] <taplar> i didn't think people trolled anymore
[20:41:02] <gambl0re> im serious. im looking at job postings and i rarely see jquery mentioned
[21:08:43] <MaesterAemon2> which subway sandwhich should I get
