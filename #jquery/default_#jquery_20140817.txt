[04:13:35] <wouterwisselink> Hi everyone.. Is there someone who can help me out with the challenge of triggering the dragging event on mouseover? I'm desperate for help.. I'm using the jQuery UI library, and search every corner of Stackoverflow and Google.
[04:36:47] <h4k1m> hi
[04:37:13] <h4k1m> is there a way to block an automatic ajax request from loading client-side?
[04:37:58] <h4k1m> I'm loading inside an iframe another site
[04:38:24] <h4k1m> and this loaded website keeps calling an annoying swf video with a music in the background
[04:38:31] <h4k1m> I want to block this sound
[04:40:20] <wouterwisselink> Hi everyone.. Is there someone who can help me out with the challenge of triggering the dragging event on mouseover? I'm desperate for help.. I'm using the jQuery UI library, and searched every corner of Stackoverflow and Google.
[05:15:18] <dokma> Anyone got an idea what's the point of the 102% in this progress bar: <div class="ui-progressbar-value ui-widget-header ui-corner-left ui-corner-right" style="width: 102%;"></div>
[05:15:45] <dokma> it just makes the progress bar larger than the parent which is exactly what I don't want
[05:15:50] <dokma> when is this usefull?
[05:16:53] <dokma> this is how I created it: $('td', row).progressbar({ value: parseInt(data.loaded / data.total * 100, 10) }).append('<div class="uploadCaption">' + parseInt(data.loaded / data.total * 100, 10) + '%</span>');
[05:28:41] <dokma> can't find where this width comes from...
[05:28:52] <dokma> anyone knows how to tell jquery not to render that param?
[05:29:09] <dokma> here's the code again:  <div class="ui-progressbar-value ui-widget-header ui-corner-left ui-corner-right" style="width: 102%;"></div>
[05:29:19] <dokma> I need to remove the width: 102%
[05:29:37] <dokma> this is how I created the progress bar: $('td', row).progressbar({ value: parseInt(data.loaded / data.total * 100, 10) }).append('<div class="uploadCaption">' + parseInt(data.loaded / data.total * 100, 10) + '%</span>');
[05:35:44] <dokma> can't find anything in the API about the width
[05:36:28] <dokma> and google gives nothing sensical for jquery progress bar "102%"
[06:38:25] <maoko> Umm. Can someone help with a little inheritance problem in coffee?
[06:39:55] <maoko> I have this kind of sturcture https://gist.github.com/anonymous/469312ba3eab35c169c9 and want to go with Slider extends SliderParams
[06:40:18] <maoko> But I don't know how to call SliderParams methods within Slider without initializing SliderParams first.
[06:40:36] <maoko> And if I do the init of the whole class, then the purpose of 'extends' is missing ;/
[06:56:23] <OnceMe> when I do inifinity loop with ajax/load more thing I append(html) into #updates id
[06:56:37] <OnceMe> and that slows down my website for each second update
[06:56:59] <OnceMe> how do I fix that?
[06:57:29] <OnceMe> I have javascript which on hover shows [x] button but its not affecting new loaded content
[06:57:45] <OnceMe> maybe because I'm simply appending .html() ?
[07:13:30] <ITChap> Hi everyone
[07:28:13] <OnceMe> can someone help me?
[07:32:01] <BillCriswell> OnceMe: Just ask.
[07:32:54] <OnceMe> I did :D
[07:33:00] <OnceMe> BillCriswell:my favorite guy :D
[07:33:18] <OnceMe> Anyway do you want me to put it online?
[07:34:02] <OnceMe> brb
[07:35:55] <BillCriswell> That makes it easiest.
[07:39:18] <OnceMe> BillCriswell:http://pastebin.com/9AiXFqjn
[07:39:34] <OnceMe> I shorted it up because dom is way bigger
[07:40:02] <OnceMe> in short, this works, but when I appent html in #updates jquery is not affecting loaded content
[07:40:30] <OnceMe> I read about some delegation, but I have a big big dom, so I'm not sure how will I manually add for each class and ID data?
[07:41:33] <BillCriswell> OnceMe: You'd just put a listener on a common parent and wait for the event there.
[07:42:04] <BillCriswell> $('.parent').on('click', '.child', function () { /* Work with `this` which will be a .child */ });
[07:44:20] <OnceMe> BillCriswell:can you write an example based on what I pasted?
[07:44:25] <OnceMe> I'm not sure what that would be
[07:44:38] <OnceMe> $('.box').on('click', '.boxhover', function ()
[07:44:40] <OnceMe> like that?
[07:44:57] <BillCriswell> Where are they?
[07:45:09] <OnceMe> http://pastebin.com/9AiXFqjn
[07:45:34] <OnceMe> may I pm you?
[07:46:33] <BillCriswell> OnceMe: We can talk in here, no reason for the PM.
[07:47:04] <BillCriswell> OnceMe: Can you set up what you're trying to do here in a demo? I'm just having a really hard time understand what you're trying to do: http://jsbin.com/
[07:47:32] <OnceMe> well have you looked at my pastebin?
[07:47:37] <OnceMe> There is a superajax() code
[07:48:03] <OnceMe> which performs infinity ajax load, however jquery scripts which are included on index page does not affect loaded content
[07:48:35] <OnceMe> so I had to re-include them inside ajax/ajax_more.php which slows down infinity load
[07:49:38] <OnceMe> BillCriswell:clearer?
[07:50:13] <BillCriswell> OnceMe: Instead of ajaxing things in do .append(htmlExample);
[07:50:55] <OnceMe> what?
[07:51:06] <OnceMe> Yes I append it
[07:51:07] <OnceMe> success: function(html){
[07:51:07] <OnceMe>                     $("#updates").append(html);
[07:51:20] <OnceMe> but I have a feeling that is what I'm doing wrong
[07:51:34] <OnceMe> because jquery scripts never affect loaded content "html"
[07:52:17] <BillCriswell> OnceMe: Do $('#updates').on('click', '.box', function () { console.log(this); }); and that should help you get this a bit.
[07:53:39] <OnceMe> ok
[07:54:42] <OnceMe> undefined function BillCriswell
[07:57:58] <OnceMe> maybe because event click is not valid
[07:58:02] <BillCriswell> OnceMe: http://jsbin.com/zadayujuxime/1/edit?html,css,js,output does this help clear things up?
[07:58:09] <OnceMe> as I call this on scroll, so its automatically loaded?
[07:59:39] <BillCriswell> You don't have to load it every time.
[08:00:10] <OnceMe> hmm I load 10 boxes per ajax load
[08:00:20] <OnceMe> and also have many elements inside box
[08:00:33] <OnceMe> how would I get data from ajax_more.php? JSON?
[08:00:38] <OnceMe> Its very unclear to me
[08:00:49] <OnceMe> is there no better faster way of handling this?
[08:01:07] <BillCriswell> It can return json or just plain html.
[08:01:40] <BillCriswell> Like you're doing. The example I set up is no different really than ajaxing in data. I think you're just trying to listen for events on newly loaded elements but I really have no idea anymore.
[08:02:32] <OnceMe> yes
[08:02:40] <OnceMe> I want to listen on events who are newly loaded
[08:02:46] <OnceMe> but why I cant just append(html)
[08:03:02] <BillCriswell> You can.
[08:03:03] <OnceMe> html already have all the elements in place, is there no an option in jquery which automatically do this?
[08:03:12] <BillCriswell> That's exactly what's happening in the example I showed you.
[08:03:38] <OnceMe> yeah
[08:03:46] <OnceMe> only difference is, you have actual element
[08:03:47] <OnceMe> <div class="box">' + ( i++ ) + '</div>
[08:04:04] <OnceMe> which you append, and I append html which is html = <div class="box">random data</div>
[08:04:13] <BillCriswell> That doesn't matter.
[08:04:21] <OnceMe> great
[08:04:35] <OnceMe> so why does my javascripts does not affect loaded content?
[08:04:40] <OnceMe> jquery* scripts
[08:05:32] <OnceMe> for example imagine this, I have close.js which is included in index.php and it does next: on hover show [x] and on click close the form, now when I ajax more and append (html) to #updates, that is new data and close.js does not affect that new data
[08:05:36] <BillCriswell> because jquery can only attach event listeners to elements that exist when the script is called. So since #updates is available on load we put the listener on that.
[08:05:36] <OnceMe> why is that happening?
[08:06:02] <OnceMe> ok so I have 40 elements
[08:06:12] <OnceMe> I had to attach listener to each of them!?
[08:06:14] <OnceMe> o.0
[08:06:30] <BillCriswell> No.
[08:07:32] <OnceMe> so only for close element?
[08:07:48] <OnceMe> in my case .boxhover?
[08:10:01] <BillCriswell> OnceMe: http://jsbin.com/rogokonowiga/1/edit?html,js,output
[08:13:48] <BillCriswell> OnceMe: http://jsbin.com/rogokonowiga/2/edit
[08:14:00] <krz> anyone use hopscotch before? where is the css file it is suggesting to use?
[08:14:02] <krz> https://github.com/linkedin/hopscotch
[08:14:38] <BillCriswell> krz: dist/css/
[08:15:51] <krz> ohhhh!
[08:18:59] <OnceMe> BillCriswell:got it
[08:19:11] <OnceMe> so all I had to do is to redefine js code again
[08:19:26] <OnceMe> because I have starting position index.php with no ajax load content
[08:20:09] <BillCriswell> You're not defining anything again. It just runs one.
[08:21:31] <OnceMe> -.-
[08:21:40] <OnceMe> yeah but add this into html left box   <div class="box">2</div>
[08:21:40] <OnceMe>   <div class="box">2</div>
[08:21:40] <OnceMe>   <div class="box">2</div>
[08:21:47] <OnceMe> and hover over them, youll see there is no x.
[08:22:41] <OnceMe> wait it works
[08:22:42] <OnceMe> o.0 how come
[08:22:43] <BillCriswell> OnceMe: http://jsbin.com/rogokonowiga/2/edit did you look at this example?
[08:24:15] <BillCriswell> I used css to get the x.
[08:26:01] <OnceMe> I can see
[08:26:08] <OnceMe> where do I put that code inside my actual code?
[08:26:12] <OnceMe> after appent(html);?
[08:27:06] <BillCriswell> It doesn't matter as long as the container the listener is put on is ready.
[08:28:39] <OnceMe> BillCriswell:so I put it inside scroll element or in function superajax() outside of scroller
[08:28:40] <OnceMe> ?
[08:29:00] <OnceMe> if is in scroller then close hover wont affect elements which are 1st loaded in index.php page right?
[08:29:43] <BillCriswell> OnceMe: I am not following you.
[08:30:52] <BillCriswell> You don't need to put it in superajax and definitely not in the scroll event.
[08:31:14] <BillCriswell> It's really ok to just put it at the start of things.
[08:33:42] <OnceMe> let me check
[08:36:39] <hooligan321> hm I am doing something inside .getJSON() and then I want to do another call to soundclouds  SC.get how can I make the function that homes SC.get wait till SC.get completes?
[08:38:51] <Madsy> hooligan321: Use $jQuery.when() to wait for multiple promises/deferreds
[08:39:28] <Madsy> hooligan321: But if you have code which depends on multiple ajax requests, you might want to rethink your design.
[08:39:32] <OnceMe> BillCriswell:$updates.on('click', '.hidden-close', function() { } says undefined function
[08:39:48] <BillCriswell> OnceMe: You might be using old jQuery or something.
[08:39:59] <OnceMe> 1.6
[08:40:57] <BillCriswell> Yeah .on isn't available in 1.6, you'd need to use $updates.delegate('.hidden-close', 'click', function () { });
[08:41:19] <BillCriswell> hooligan321:I don't believe when would do them in order. I think you want then().
[08:41:57] <hooligan321> yep Madsy i know.. i want really do the that sc.get functionality inside the php that gives the json to the initial getJSON() call
[08:43:07] <OnceMe> BillCriswell:http://pastebin.com/Z6FB8WLd
[08:43:12] <OnceMe> whats the issue there? on hover [x] does not show
[08:43:23] <hooligan321> I must say tho i liked the way you could slap soundclouds js api in from a cdn and start mucking about straight away :)
[08:43:36] <OnceMe> <div class="hidden-close"><form class="megaform"></form>...</div>
[08:43:41] <OnceMe> thats my real dom
[08:44:15] <BillCriswell> OnceMe: Why not use CSS here?
[08:44:16] <OnceMe> hidden-close is parent and closeshow is inside hidden-close
[08:44:29] <OnceMe> I am using css for something else ;)
[08:44:44] <OnceMe> but I really want to figure out how this works
[08:44:50] <BillCriswell> You can use css for more than one thing.
[08:46:25] <OnceMe> I know :D
[08:46:31] <OnceMe> but what is actually wrong in my code? p/.=
[08:47:31] <OnceMe> $(document).ready(function() { }
[08:47:32] <OnceMe> lol
[08:47:58] <Madsy> hooligan321: https://gist.github.com/Madsy/5ef9c64747af9b7bf896
[08:48:14] <rmill> OnceMe: You need a closing `);`
[08:48:23] <BillCriswell> You're trying to attach mouse over and mouse enter events after a click event.
[08:48:26] <OnceMe> yeah all that is fixed
[08:48:26] <rmill> sans `` (naturally)
[08:48:32] <OnceMe> I did changed it to hover
[08:48:56] <BillCriswell> You're attaching new mouseovers every time you click a hidden close.
[08:49:15] <hooligan321> thanks Madsy :)
[08:49:32] <Madsy> You're welcome
[08:49:38] <OnceMe> ?
[08:50:35] <Tuly-> Hi there,
[08:50:50] <Tuly-> Has anyone ever used lightGallery ?
[08:51:41] <OnceMe> BillCriswell:http://pastebin.com/DPz8vH8L
[08:51:52] <OnceMe> without delegate function works fine
[08:52:28] <BillCriswell> Jesus.
[08:52:41] <OnceMe> ?:D
[08:53:44] <phoenixsun> .
[08:56:25] <OnceMe> BillCriswell:whats wrong?
[09:02:58] <Golynx> is it ok use JSON.parse(); on every page load ? Is that abusing it in any way ? http://bpaste.net/show/624503/
[09:04:50] <BillCriswell> Golynx: Yeah that's fine to do.
[09:07:26] <OnceMe> YEAH it works!
[09:07:28] <Golynx> just localStorage dont support arrays and you have to put the original json array into a string to work with localStorage. Then you have to parse that json string array back to an object to be used by the script. I just thought that JSON.parse() will be hard hit on the javascript engine somehow.
[09:07:29] <OnceMe> thanks BillCriswell!
[09:09:12] <BillCriswell> OnceMe: No problem.
[09:09:12] <Golynx> anyway ty BillCriswell
[09:09:40] <BillCriswell> Golynx: Yeah, that wouldn't be a huge del.
[09:09:42] <phoenixsun> hi room, I was wondering where I could fine some more advanced jQuery examples
[09:10:40] <phoenixsun> examples where div content is changed but more than singular words or images
[09:11:21] <BillCriswell> phoenixsun: That's a really vague question.
[09:12:22] <phoenixsun> BillCriswell: I am working on a SPA of sorts. A music player and I just want to know if I am using best practise concepts
[09:12:41] <phoenixsun> I want to do these like populate content onscroll dynamically
[09:12:48] <phoenixsun> and have other dynamic views
[09:15:15] <BillCriswell> phoenixsun: I think you'd be better showing what you're doing and maybe having others suggest.
[09:16:05] <phoenixsun> BillCriswell: ok when its at its next iteration I will come for advice
[09:17:23] <jop008> How can I place my button next to the listview element?
[09:17:37] <jop008> on the same row can't find it tried it for hours
[09:18:43] <kamanato> I have a question about jstree, how can I pop up a confirmation dialog before move_node is executed? Then if answer is ok move if not do nothing ?
[09:19:48] <hooligan321> dam does not look like SC.get returns a promise from itself
[09:20:22] <hooligan321> oh well nm forget it im gona do it in php
[09:20:31] <hooligan321> and stop being the R word lol
[09:20:55] <hooligan321> that was interesting to learn about
[09:24:50] <kamanato> I have a question about jstree, how can I pop up a confirmation dialog before move_node is executed? Then if answer is ok move if not do nothing ?
[10:15:36] <neredsenvy> Is there anyway to generate an Image/PDF using jquery ? Say I have a DIV element with some text on it is there a way to make a screen shot of the contents ?
[10:16:38] <hooligan321> man that $.when thing is so much better for ajax job control :)
[10:31:30] <jop008> how to place the button next to the list item? http://jsfiddle.net/RB9Qw/5/
[11:48:32] <OnceMe> actually BillCriswell
[11:48:45] <OnceMe> your code does not work as I previously discussed here http://jsbin.com/kiwemacacaho/1/edit
[11:49:04] <OnceMe> new appended data is fine when you click [x] but try to hide 1st two elements, it won't work.
[11:49:22] <OnceMe> thats what I meant when I said "Do I need to redefine methods"
[11:54:56] <BillCriswell> OnceMe: They're not inside #updates though.
[11:55:52] <digitalice> hello!
[11:55:54] <digitalice> I'm building a site using koajs. My client asked me to display prices in local currency. Is there any plugin that detects the local country and converts a USD price to the local currency? Any approach (backend or frontend) is good for me.
[11:56:02] <OnceMe> BillCriswell:Thats what I thought on the start
[11:56:09] <OnceMe> and that is what confused me the most
[11:57:23] <BillCriswell> Does it make sense now?
[12:00:08] <digitalice> I'm building a site using koajs. My client asked me to display prices in local currency. Is there any plugin that detects the local country and converts a USD price to the local currency? Any approach (backend or frontend) is good for me.
[12:00:21] <OnceMe> Yes
[12:01:15] <digitalice> Do you know the name?
[12:01:59] <OnceMe> "Yes" is answer to BillCriswell question.
[12:05:44] <digitalice> oh :(
[12:05:57] <Jattenalle> digitalice, you need a geoip lookip to get the location of the client, then you need to use a currency/nation database to match it, then you need to use "up to date" exchange rates
[12:06:09] <Jattenalle> and in the end, everyone will be pissed off because geoip localization is obnoxious
[12:06:17] <Jattenalle> let the user pick which currency they want things in
[12:06:19] <Jattenalle> same for language
[12:06:25] <Jattenalle> never auto-force stuff down users throats
[12:06:28] <Jattenalle> it's bad design
[12:06:32] <Jattenalle> and annoying
[12:06:39] <Jattenalle> lookip -> lookup*
[12:07:09] <Jattenalle> but to answer your question, i dont know of any complete plugin to handle that
[12:07:36] <Jattenalle> implementing a manual currency/language system is much easier as well
[12:07:47] <Jattenalle> since it leaves you with just the one step: exchange rates
[12:07:50] <Jattenalle> as opposed to all three steps
[12:08:00] <Jattenalle> less points of failure, and users get to pick which they prefer
[12:08:01] <Jattenalle> win win
[12:08:23] <OnceMe> so BillCriswell if I have <div class="hidden-close"><form class="form"><span class="la"></span><span class="like"><span class="bleh"></span></span></form> I can manipulate that with $updates.delegate('.bleh', 'click', function() { //send ajax } );
[12:08:24] <OnceMe> right?
[12:09:45] <BillCriswell> OnceMe: If it's in whatever $updates is sure.
[12:10:10] <OnceMe> $updates = ("#updates")
[12:10:29] <OnceMe> and this is like <div id="updates"><div class="hidden-close"><form class="form"><span class="la"></span><span class="like"><span class="bleh"></span></span></form/div>
[12:11:01] <BillCriswell> Yeah, that would work.
[12:17:23] <evilbug> is it bad practice to use jQuery(document).ready(function($) {}); instead of short hand at the start of a file?
[12:19:44] <tw2113> what shorthand version?
[12:20:18] <hooligan321> $() he means
[12:20:57] <tw2113> that shorthand assumes that $ has the jQuery alias
[12:21:18] <tw2113> the first one makes sure it does within the scope of the function as well as make sure the document global is ready
[12:25:02] <evilbug> tw2113: right, but is it bad practice to declare it that way even though nothing else is using $?
[12:27:26] <tw2113> no
[12:27:30] <tw2113> i wouldn't say that
[12:28:17] <tw2113> given how much i do stuff with WordPress, I purposely made it habit
[12:31:04] <evilbug> tw2113: ok, cool. i was trying to decide on wether i should make it a habit.
[12:36:07] <hooligan321> safari 5.1 = lol
[12:36:38] <hooligan321> they may as well take that down man heheh
[13:20:53] <davlefou> hi, how can i look for somes radio input in children? I need to kwon if there or not!
[13:44:04] <Neobenedict> guys i need a simple jquery .mp3 player, with a play button/position/volume

[13:48:43] <tw2113> why not the html5 audio stuff
[14:36:04] <OnceMe> whats the name of that BillCraswell guy?
[14:36:13] <OnceMe> I mean username?
[14:36:18] <OnceMe> I cant pull up logs
[14:40:31] <shoky_> OnceMe: he just said:  <BillCriswell> Yeah, that would work.
[14:41:15] <shoky_> log is here btw  http://irc.jquery.org/%23jquery/latest.log.html
[15:25:41] <dettygt> Heey all.  I am dynamically loading some links and need to remove <br /> tags from each link generated (the br tag is in the href attribute of the anchor).  What's the best way to do it in jquery?  I am using an .attr / .replace combo now but it's making all the links the same href. :(
[15:27:48] <dettygt> http://jsbin.com/caqifuziduyu/1/ is an example
[15:31:59] <tw2113> how the heck are they getting there in the first place?
[15:34:57] <dettygt> @tw2113 from my CMS
[15:35:22] <tw2113> i'd fix the source over the end result
[15:35:47] <dettygt> problem is, the field needs to be a textarea with BR because they also display the address in another location.
[15:35:55] <dettygt> I wish I could :)
[15:39:36] <tw2113> if it's fetched via php at ome point, you could use strip_tags()
[15:40:59] <dettygt> Yeah, that might be a better option
[15:46:26] <cjwelborn> dettygt: if you ended up having to fix it on the front end, this would be my version: http://welbornprod.com/paste/?id=eizx
[15:47:54] <dettygt> cjwelborn: brilliant.  I forgot about the /g for global. :)
[18:32:11] <sammych> for some reason Chrome stopped sending mouse hover or something. No CSS hover effects, couldn't drag/pan/highlight text, or even drag the window scroll bar. Weirdest bug ever
[18:32:19] <sammych> on any site, btw.
[18:34:07] <BillCriswell> sammych: Have you tried restarting chrome?
[18:34:13] <BillCriswell> Also, any errors in the consol.e?
[18:34:28] <sammych> it works now, after restarting chrome twice
[18:34:42] <sammych> I didn't see any errors
[18:35:13] <BillCriswell> sammych: Yeah, never any fun when a Chrome restart fixed something.

[18:53:44] <Destructor> que ya de paso incluya jquery ui
[19:11:02] <hooligan321> hm having a problem with jplayer which i see is a an official jquery plugin now .. well for some reason in firefox when you try and do audio routing with the source being from  createmediaelementsource you get silence .. I am pritty sure it worked fine before so its hard to say which is responsible jquery went to 2.6 and firefox updates prity often so somethings got broked
[19:13:14] <hooligan321> if you want proof
[19:13:14] <hooligan321> http://www.ofrecordings.com/spectest/index-ffx.html
[19:13:43] <hooligan321> i just want to know which ones responsible for fking over the pooch this time :(
[19:16:08] <hooligan321> damn it stinking fox wrecking havok in our shiny new tool box
[19:16:34] <Jattenalle> hooligan321, i dont know why you are being so pissy

[19:16:47] <Destructor> hi all
[19:16:56] <hooligan321> you dont get a spectrum analyser either though do ya?
[19:17:06] <Destructor> do you know any book about advanced jquery / jquery ui?
[19:17:07] <Jattenalle> i dont get silence
[19:22:36] <hooligan321> typical Jattenalle that is not even a normal implimentation
[19:22:50] <hooligan321> it does not do audio routing it just sneakly uses a callback
[19:22:52] <hooligan321> http://ianreah.com/2013/02/28/Real-time-analysis-of-streaming-audio-data-with-Web-Audio-API.html
[19:23:14] <Jattenalle> hooligan321, what are you talking about? i was just trying to help, take your piss and shit somewhere else.. i dont care.
[19:23:42] <hooligan321> wtf?? take a fucking chill pill i was not being "pissy" at all
[19:23:47] <hooligan321> how can you know mr fucking mind reader?
[19:23:53] <Jattenalle> my bad
[19:23:57] <Jattenalle> i read it wrong
[19:24:12] <Jattenalle> <hooligan321> typical Jattenalle that is not even a normal implimentation
[19:24:21] <Jattenalle> i thought you were telling me i was doing it wrong when i went to the site and got audio
[19:24:27] <Jattenalle> my apologies
[19:24:45] <hooligan321> no why would i do that :) .. i was just say that example i found is not normal web audio
[19:26:43] <hooligan321> Jattenalle do you mind telling me if the example worked at all in that tutorial i pasted in
[19:27:07] <Jattenalle> the ianreah link?
[19:27:13] <hooligan321> yes
[19:27:46] <Jattenalle> uhm, it doesnt load the audio file
[19:28:38] <Jattenalle> ok, i get audio, no visualizer
[19:28:42] <Jattenalle> same as on your site
[19:28:51] <Jattenalle> FF 31
[19:29:00] <hooligan321> yep it has to be in firefox then
[19:29:08] <hooligan321> they updated later then jplayer
[19:29:27] <hooligan321> ty
[19:30:08] <hooligan321> epic so they broke the whole routing system by looks of it
[19:30:18] <hooligan321> its not just createmediaelementsource
[19:32:38] <hooligan321> well today has been a learing experience
[19:32:41] <hooligan321> lol
[19:35:13] <hooligan321> i learned that apple think web audio applications are computer games .. as per there work flow diagrams on apple development pages and that firefox 31 years of age is still needs to corected at juvenil pssychiatric hospital
[19:43:05] <hooligan321> this kind of explains it

[19:53:19] <hugo_moss> whats up with onkeyup and typing real fast and then hitting tab fast, onkeyup is never called
[19:59:06] <ZeroBeholder> hugo_moss: whatever your element that had focus for onkeyup may not have focus anymore and if the action was context sensitive, well, the world changed on it and it may not have 'bubbled up' properly. Or the JS implementation you are dealing with may not be perfect. Then again, the code may be doing something contrary to the way you think it should work.
[20:03:09] <neredsenvy> var elts = $('.content-nav li a'); returns array of <a href="..">...</a> instead of Objects
[20:03:24] <neredsenvy> Is there a call that would return objects so I could call attr() method on them ?
[20:06:32] <Jattenalle> neredsenvy, elts[0] is the first object of that list
[20:07:05] <Jattenalle> if you want the same attr on all of them, you can just do that directly
[20:07:14] <neredsenvy> Jattenalle: When I call elts[0].attr() I get undefined method error
[20:07:16] <hugo_moss> ZeroBeholder: is that normal for jquery keyup to ignore tab? is that the desired behavior?
[20:07:26] <Jattenalle> neredsenvy, $(elts[0]).attr();
[20:07:28] <neredsenvy> I need to loop over each one and change the href
[20:07:31] <neredsenvy> Ah
[20:08:42] <Jattenalle> you can also do $('your content thing').each(function(index, element){ stuff! });
[20:09:04] <Jattenalle> ie: $('your content thing').each(function(index, element){ $(this).attr() });
[20:09:34] <d3m0n> j #blackhole
[20:10:45] <Jattenalle> neredsenvy, ^^
[20:11:11] <neredsenvy> Jattenalle: Thanks it worked like charm

[20:20:55] <phantasmacode> tw2113: which better https://github.com/Prinzhorn/skrollr or infinite scroll to create one page scrolling

[21:52:13] <hooligan321> rikes 3D accell in ff nightly = fail epic
[21:52:35] <hooligan321> looks like ff is going through troubled times
[21:52:42] <hooligan321> i'll leave it alone for a few months again

[22:24:43] <Uhkis> bleeding edge bleeds
[22:46:04] <JordanSimps> Anyone willing to help out someone in need of jQuery assistance?
[22:49:56] <Uhkis> JordanSimps: just ask
[22:52:48] <JordanSimps> I’m trying to make a jQuery slideshow. I want the width of this slideshow to be 100%. I followed a tutorial at http://www.webchiefdesign.co.uk/blog/simple-jquery-slideshow/index.php . I sort of got it setup, but the problem is when the image transitions to the next photo, it doesn’t show the next photo. I assume this is because I’m using percentage to determine the width instead of the actual width of the images I’d be using in the slideshow. A
[22:52:48] <JordanSimps> example of my problem can be seen at http://simplyjordan.net
[22:59:38] <hooligan321> I never complained I'm just saying i cant get no satisfaction
[22:59:45] <hooligan321> poor end users as well
[22:59:49] <hooligan321> personally i use chrome
[23:00:05] <hooligan321> but then there new development tools in firefox are pretty damn nice i must say
[23:02:49] <hooligan321> heh even helped me debug some problems in some of the code i have got incorperated into my site now that chrome was not picking up on .. and now that it fixed its faster too!! so woot for foxy roxy! ..heh no but seriously I would in fact highly recomend checking out the latest ff to any one who hasnt for a while as its come along a great deal now
[23:59:35] <blindMoe> are the easing methods built into jquery yet or is the easing plugin still required?
