[00:53:14] <firespeaker> is there a good xpath way to get a subset of <li>s where the value of a given attribute of a <div> that's within the <li> matches a certain value?
[00:54:20] <robertmaxrees> why xpath?
[00:54:37] <firespeaker> robertmaxrees: no reason; anything jquery-friendly will do
[00:54:47] <robertmaxrees> then you don't want xpath :)
[00:54:58] <robertmaxrees> and i'd use a filter here
[00:55:03] <firespeaker> probably not
[00:55:28] <firespeaker> hmm
[00:55:42] <firespeaker> looks powerful
[00:56:08] <firespeaker> and a lot more efficient than the for loops I'm using now
[00:56:16] <robertmaxrees> very
[00:56:19] <robertmaxrees> quite easy.
[00:56:29] <robertmaxrees> filter with a function is awesome.
[00:57:27] <firespeaker> I don't totally get what attaching a function to it does
[00:58:03] <robertmaxrees> you return true or false from the function to determine whether or not an element stays
[00:58:21] <robertmaxrees> lemme show you.
[01:00:46] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/9jmrduLj/
[01:01:08] <robertmaxrees> get the idea?
[01:01:45] <firespeaker> oh wow
[01:01:48] <firespeaker> that's pretty cool
[01:02:01] <firespeaker> is .data specially designed for attributes that start with data- ?
[01:02:04] <robertmaxrees> it's the swiss army knife of getting the elements you want.
[01:02:13] <robertmaxrees> yes - you can also set using .data()
[01:02:28] <firespeaker> where has this been all my life
[01:02:38] <robertmaxrees> hiding in jquery forever
[01:02:50] <firespeaker> yeah I'm hopeless at jquery o_O
[01:03:07] <firespeaker> I guess I'll learn by doing, in this case
[01:03:28] <robertmaxrees> :) if you need more help we're here
[01:04:01] <firespeaker> cool, I'll poke at this some and see what I can get to work
[01:06:06] <firespeaker> hmm, is advisable to apply page-wide css based on a data-* attribute, or am I best off just leaving that as a class?
[01:06:57] <robertmaxrees> as a class.
[01:06:59] <robertmaxrees> each time.
[01:07:10] <robertmaxrees> data attributes aren't meant for styling.
[01:08:44] <firespeaker> okay
[01:08:47] <firespeaker> thanks
[01:09:18] <firespeaker> data-* stuff in the <li> directly is going to work so much better than selecting <li>s based on some <span>s inside them
[01:09:34] <robertmaxrees> you can also select based on contents of spans.
[01:09:54] <robertmaxrees> but if you can add data attributes, you can add classes.
[01:11:13] <firespeaker> yep :D
[01:12:05] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[01:12:09] <firespeaker> is === for value instead of reference comparison or something?
[01:12:27] <robertmaxrees> it's equality without coercion.
[01:12:39] <robertmaxrees> '0' == 0 is true.  '0' === 0 is false
[01:12:56] <firespeaker> ah, cool
[01:12:57] <firespeaker> thanks
[01:13:25] <robertmaxrees> deffo
[01:19:14] <firespeaker> is there a way to do foreach ?
[01:19:24] <robertmaxrees> just each.
[01:19:29] <firespeaker> instead of counting array length and referring to the index
[01:19:35] <firespeaker> ah
[01:19:37] <robertmaxrees> $('something').each()
[01:19:42] <robertmaxrees> pass it a function.
[01:19:47] <robertmaxrees> $(this) refers to the element.
[01:19:50] <robertmaxrees> api docs explain more.
[01:19:54] <firespeaker> jquery rules
[01:20:16] <firespeaker> I had like 50 lines of buggy code that didn't even totally do what I wanted
[01:20:22] <firespeaker> and it's going to be like 5 lines of jquery
[01:20:29] <firespeaker> really one line technically
[01:20:29] <robertmaxrees> check out the learning center, too.
[01:20:39] <firespeaker> learning center?
[01:20:59] <robertmaxrees> learn.jquery.com
[01:23:20] <firespeaker> hmmm what if I have a function in the filter, and the filter's in an each?  then there are two $(this)s
[01:23:28] <robertmaxrees> show me.
[01:23:30] <robertmaxrees> :)
[01:23:43] <robertmaxrees> because you're probably overcomplicating this.
[01:24:16] <firespeaker> $types.each($('li.publication').filter(function () { return $(this).data('pubtype') == _________; }).doSomething();
[01:24:25] <firespeaker> ______ is where I want the instance of $types
[01:24:29] <robertmaxrees> that's now how you use each
[01:24:30] <firespeaker> $types is just an array of strings
[01:24:32] <robertmaxrees> *not
[01:24:36] <firespeaker> oh?
[01:24:58] <robertmaxrees> https://api.jquery.com/each/
[01:25:02] <robertmaxrees> it takes a function.
[01:25:12] <robertmaxrees> make a fiddle.
[01:25:13] <firespeaker> oh
[01:25:23] <robertmaxrees> just paste in some simple html and go from ther.
[01:32:41] <firespeaker> robertmaxrees: I think I'm not getting how the function in each works...  https://jsfiddle.net/5nhn53o6/
[01:33:03] <robertmaxrees> you're missing closeing curclies.
[01:33:04] <firespeaker> or how functions work in general in jquery
[01:33:05] <robertmaxrees> *curlies.
[01:33:06] <robertmaxrees> one sec.
[01:33:15] <firespeaker> oh shoot, I am
[01:33:29] <robertmaxrees> but you're conflating things.
[01:33:30] <firespeaker> but that doesn't make it work
[01:33:31] <firespeaker> yeah
[01:33:48] <robertmaxrees> what are you trying to do here?
[01:33:59] <robertmaxrees> if the data-type is in the types array, add a class?
[01:34:02] <firespeaker> just make anything that has data-type="test" have bgcolor red
[01:34:15] <firespeaker> oh
[01:34:15] <firespeaker> yeah
[01:34:24] <robertmaxrees> muuuch simpler way here.
[01:34:39] <robertmaxrees> also: wrong each for arrays ;)
[01:35:22] <firespeaker> (01:19:15) firespeaker: is there a way to do foreach ?
[01:35:23] <firespeaker> I think of foreach as being for arrays/lists, not elements
[01:35:30] <firespeaker> but I guess I didn't specify...
[01:35:37] <robertmaxrees> heh
[01:35:54] <firespeaker> also, applying a class is not what I'm doing in the end
[01:36:08] <robertmaxrees> what are you doing?
[01:36:09] <firespeaker> I'm actually doing a sorting thing
[01:36:20] <firespeaker> I want the elements I single out to go to a different list
[01:36:28] <firespeaker> based on which type it is
[01:36:45] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/5nhn53o6/1/
[01:36:47] <robertmaxrees> a freebie.
[01:37:42] <firespeaker> okay, I see what you did there
[01:45:20] <firespeaker> what if I want to make an element for each item in the array?
[01:45:31] <firespeaker> is each what I want for that?
[01:45:34] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[01:45:36] <robertmaxrees> forEach
[01:45:38] <robertmaxrees> for the array.
[01:45:39] <firespeaker> aha!
[01:46:11] <robertmaxrees> there's an $.each() that you could use, but you should favor .forEach() instaed.
[01:46:58] <firespeaker> interesting
[01:50:22] <firespeaker> is the right way to append an <li> to a <ul> really $('ul').append('<li>blah</li>') ?
[01:50:33] <systemfault> Yup
[01:50:49] <firespeaker> seems very un-jquery
[01:51:00] <systemfault> Not sure how.
[01:52:36] <robertmaxrees> what would you espect?
[01:52:38] <robertmaxrees> *expect?
[01:52:39] <firespeaker> I'd expect something more like $('ul').append(elem('li')) or something
[01:53:02] <robertmaxrees> you can append jquery objects, too.
[01:53:10] <systemfault> You can also do var elem = $('<li>blah</li>'); $('ul').append(elem);
[01:53:11] <robertmaxrees> but if you're building on the fly, that's what you wnat.
[01:53:11] <firespeaker> raw html instead of some relational javascripty thing seems weird
[01:53:24] <firespeaker> okay
[01:53:26] <firespeaker> fair enough
[01:53:27] <robertmaxrees> see my prior statment + systemfault's statement :)
[01:53:34] <robertmaxrees> not relational fwiw.
[02:25:13] <firespeaker> is there a reason .forEach can't be called on an associative array?
[02:25:18] <firespeaker> .forEach()
[02:30:55] <systemfault> Because JS doesn't have associative arrays.
[02:31:04] <ismithers> Can anyone recommend a good plugin that does image effects (like blur, greyscale etc) I wish to get something that works on most browsers (IE10+ and Edge seem the main difficult customers atm).
[02:34:02] <ismithers> Of course, as I type that I got the one I'm using to work...
[02:36:47] <firespeaker> systemfault: hmm so if I make a json associative array, is there a straightforward way to loop through it (or similar)?
[02:37:04] <systemfault> It's an object, not an associative array
[02:37:19] <firespeaker> okay
[02:37:27] <systemfault> The easy way is to call Object.keys(theObject) to get an array of keys and iterate through them
[02:37:50] <firespeaker> the iteration could be done with forEach() at that point?
[02:38:14] <systemfault> Yeah, because it's an array of keys
[02:38:39] <systemfault> Object.keys(myObject).forEach(function(key) { console.log(myObject[key]); });
[02:39:41] <firespeaker> cool
[02:39:43] <firespeaker> thanks systemfault

[08:16:36] <codecutter> how do i call a link from a function (no ajax)?
[08:17:14] <MikeD_> window.location ?
[08:17:35] <MikeD_> * from some interpretation of "call a link"
[08:17:43] <codecutter> e.g. can I do something like <a href="..> without having the element in doc?
[08:17:51] <codecutter> from a function
[08:18:06] <codecutter> make sense?
[08:18:06] <MikeD_> are you trying to create a dom node or cause navigation to a new url?
[08:18:32] <MikeD_> window.location = "http://google.com";
[08:18:45] <codecutter> i am trying to get data from the server, i don;t need to ajax becuase the page with reload
[08:18:57] <codecutter> can i use ajax with page refresh?

[08:19:23] <tocka> having a bit of a problem.. Cant find the closest div with a class :| could someone give some advice? https://jsfiddle.net/e3pt6v2j/
[08:19:27] <MikeD_> i don't understand the question
[08:19:33] <codecutter> let m try again
[08:20:10] <MikeD_> tocka: you don't have the "." before the class name
[08:20:35] <tocka> MikeD_ https://jsfiddle.net/e3pt6v2j/1/
[08:20:39] <tocka> Its still the same tho :|
[08:20:41] <systemfault> tocka: That's because you don't understand what it does.
[08:20:53] <systemfault> .closest is not magic
[08:20:59] <tocka> I thought it was :|
[08:21:14] <MikeD_> yeah, it's going to find the closest ancestor (or self)
[08:21:16] <codecutter> you would normally click on a link <a href="#"> to a new page, can I do this inside a function without having a tag?
[08:21:22] <mar77i> hmm. what's wrong with my eyesight, this <input type="submit"> box inside a form tag doesn't cause the form to even try to submit.
[08:21:25] <MikeD_> not "look around for something nearby"
[08:21:32] <tocka> systemfault then.. Is there another way?
[08:21:33] <tocka> :/
[08:21:40] <codecutter> you would normally click on a link <a href="#"> to go to a new page. Can I do this inside a function without having a tag?
[08:21:55] <codecutter> make sense?
[08:22:04] <systemfault> tocka: There's always a way... it's just awful
[08:22:04] <mar77i> codecutter: location = url
[08:22:17] <tocka> systemfault how awful tho? :D
[08:22:18] <MikeD_> codecutter: yes, I already told you to use window.location
[08:22:27] <codecutter> aw
[08:22:53] <systemfault> tocka: It would look like fontSelectElement.closest('.columns').next().find('.font-variant-select');
[08:23:02] <tocka> oh..
[08:23:09] <tocka> HMMMMM
[08:23:09] <tocka> :D
[08:23:15] <tocka> Thanks for the explanation
[08:23:17] <tocka> <3
[08:23:46] <mar77i> ahh
[08:24:05] <mar77i> there's another form inside this form. form-ception!
[08:24:14] <systemfault> Invalid HTML? :P
[08:25:12] <mar77i> that too. always those form-generators being self-rigteous

[08:33:04] <suexec> Can somebody explain to me why shapeshift is moving items outside the container? https://jsfiddle.net/3bfp34yj/

[08:49:02] <suexec> MikeD_, there seems to be plural choices to solve this drag and drop .. but shapeshift has seemed like the easiest one so far. Apart from this obvious problem factor that's rendering it useless for me. I am guessing I am doing something wrong though
[09:06:38] <z1haze_work> anyone here good with revolution slider?
[09:06:52] <AdamPDotty> he he he
[09:06:55] <z1haze_work> I am trying to figure out how to place things differently for mobile/tablet/desktop
[09:06:58] <hellyeah> what is that?
[09:07:14] <hellyeah> this is about media queries
[09:07:28] <hellyeah> just make a simple slider
[09:07:36] <hellyeah> and write css rules with media queries for resolution
[09:07:49] <hellyeah> or use bootstrap, foundation or such
[09:08:14] <hellyeah> i am sure pre ready slider has feature "responsiveness"
[09:08:24] <hellyeah> let me show you one
[09:09:23] <hellyeah> z1haze_work:  check this out http://lokeshdhakar.com/projects/lightbox2/

[09:11:41] <z1haze_work> i asked a question about revolution slider, was pretty specific and you linked me to lightbox
[09:11:52] <trentS> Is there a way I can stop my jSPlumb connection from not connecting Objects 4 and Objects 5? I am trying to remove the diagonal connection as I don't think it looks very nice. JsFiddle here: https://jsfiddle.net/091pwnaq/
[09:12:37] <hellyeah> sorry i read it wrongly
[09:12:52] <hellyeah> never heard revolution slider
[09:13:18] <z1haze_work> lol
[09:13:56] <z1haze_work> I think it might be the most sold premium slider ever
[09:15:34] <hellyeah> is it wordpress?
[09:16:44] <z1haze_work> i think they have a wordpress plugin too, yea, but not specifically

[10:34:03] <\monster\> Hey guys, x.html('123') vs x.empty().html('123')  // is there a difference between these two as far as removing any bound events x may contain?  Do I need to call empty or will simply doing html overwrite also clear them?
[10:34:26] <taplar> html() doesn't remove bound events on x
[10:34:35] <\monster\> oki thanks
[10:34:37] <taplar> it replaces the innerHTML of the element
[10:36:29] <taplar> or are you asking if it removes the bound events on the child elements it removes?
[10:38:23] <\monster\> ah ya if x's inner html has bound events
[10:38:25] <taplar> http://www.james.padolsey.com/jquery/#v=git&fn=jQuery.fn.html  looks like html() also does some cleanup automatically
[10:38:28] <hlve> 0.o
[10:38:31] <hlve> hi everyboday
[10:38:38] <taplar> hey
[10:39:01] <\monster\> if it overwrites innerhtml than if that html had bound events those woudl also have to be removed I would assume
[10:39:33] <taplar> strings don't have bound events
[10:39:51] <taplar> when it creates the new elements, any inline bindings would exist
[10:40:12] <taplar> otherwise that html() method is doing cleanup on the elements so internal memory used for the old children is removed
[10:42:09] <\monster\> phrased it wrong, x.append('<div id='boo'></div>'); x.find('#boo').click(function(){});  is what i mean by bound events
[10:42:47] <taplar> right
[10:43:02] <taplar> and your asking if html() will clean that up if you later replace it?
[10:43:07] <\monster\> ya
[10:43:09] <taplar> yes
[10:43:13] <\monster\> :)
[10:44:05] <taplar> if you look at that link, it either called cleanData directly, or below it calls empty().append() and empty() also does cleanData

[12:31:29] <wild_oscar> hey. I want to send an ajax request that sends the equivalent to: evaluatedRecords[0].id=99 , evaluatedRecords[1].id=822, (...).
[12:31:29] <wild_oscar> I was trying out this, but it doesn't seem to be working: https://gist.github.com/mmalmeida/0119ee773f774903f225747c801ee38c
[12:31:58] <wild_oscar> on firebug I see the post, but the JSON says [{"id":"10672"}]
[12:32:13] <wild_oscar> what am I doing wrong?
[12:34:25] <z1haze_work> can you trigger a touch event with jquery without another library?
[12:34:38] <duch_kazatel> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/eqvk2vew/
[12:34:45] <duch_kazatel> wild_oscar looks fine here.
[12:34:48] <taplar> i'm sure you can fire a touchstart and touchend
[12:35:14] <z1haze_work> i am having issues with ghost clicks i think
[12:35:29] <taplar> ?
[12:36:05] <wild_oscar> duch_kazatel: where is the evaluatedRecords bit?
[12:36:06] * taplar has flashbacks to ghostwriter
[12:36:24] <duch_kazatel> wild_oscar your console
[12:36:45] <wild_oscar> console.log of that shows: [{"id":"10672"}]
[12:37:07] <wild_oscar> is that equivalent to a request with evaluatedRecords[0].id=99 ?
[12:37:07] <duch_kazatel> that's not what i'm seeing at all.
[12:37:19] <duch_kazatel> i'm seeing [{"id":"99"},{"id":"822"}]
[12:37:21] <duch_kazatel> oh.
[12:37:36] <duch_kazatel> you're conflating object access with json./
[12:38:14] <wild_oscar> indeed. :/
[12:38:33] <duch_kazatel> so yeah, that's correct.
[12:38:38] <wild_oscar> how would I do to pass the id's in the format I need? ie, like evaluatedRecords[0].id=99 ?
[12:38:54] <duch_kazatel> you already have.
[12:39:08] <duch_kazatel> that's exactly how you do it.
[12:40:27] <taplar> unless he's expecting the key 'evaluatedRecords' to be on the request
[12:40:35] <wild_oscar> taplar: exactly
[12:40:46] <wild_oscar> ie, with  url:'SearchmarkSelectedArticlesJSON.action?evaluatedRecords[0].id=10672',
[12:40:56] <wild_oscar> I get the backend object correctly populated
[12:40:57] <taplar> which would be just a wrapping of that array in an object with that key
[12:41:46] <wild_oscar> so for 2 records I imagine url:'SearchmarkSelectedArticlesJSON.action?evaluatedRecords[0].id=10672&evaluatedRecords[1].id=822' would work
[12:42:08] <taplar> your doing a post though, and your using json
[12:42:18] <duch_kazatel> ^
[12:42:25] <duch_kazatel> stop thinking about it in accessor notation.
[12:43:30] <wild_oscar> how would I post the same information then?
[12:43:56] <taplar> { evaluatedRecords: your array }
[12:44:01] <duch_kazatel> evaluatedRecords = [{id: 10672}, {id: 822}];
[12:44:02] <duch_kazatel> etc.
[12:44:10] <taplar> let $.ajax convert it to a string
[12:44:43] <taplar> your backend when it parses it will put it in the pattern you expect
[12:48:28] <wild_oscar> taplar: I assume something like this, but this is still not being passed to the backend: https://gist.github.com/mmalmeida/0119ee773f774903f225747c801ee38c
[12:48:44] <duch_kazatel> what's not?
[12:48:49] <duch_kazatel> and what IS getting passed?
[12:50:16] <wild_oscar> duch_kazatel: evaluatedRecords%5B0%5D%5Bid%5D=10672
[12:50:27] <wild_oscar> is the post I see on firebug
[12:50:32] <wild_oscar> translated, it's evaluatedRecords[0][id]=10672
[12:50:37] <duch_kazatel> wut
[12:50:58] <duch_kazatel> something here seems off.
[12:51:45] <taplar> it looks like it is taking the object and turning it into a parameter string
[12:51:49] <taplar> which is fine
[12:51:58] <taplar> unless your backend expects it to be a json string
[12:52:23] <wild_oscar> which is close, but the backend is expecting evaluatedRecords[0].id=10672
[12:52:26] <wild_oscar> not [id]
[12:52:42] <taplar> huh?
[12:52:58] <duch_kazatel> why is your backend expecting such a bizarre format?
[12:53:02] <taplar> have you checked if it is working with the backend?
[12:54:53] <wild_oscar> why does it expect that format? I don't know. it's the way Struts2 does automatic conversion of strings from the request to java objects in the backend
[12:55:16] <taplar> is it working?
[12:55:37] <taplar> i feel like you are looking at the ajax request and assuming it is not working with the backend
[12:55:43] <shoky_> wild_oscar: try setting  traditional: true  setting on $.ajax
[12:56:21] <wild_oscar> taplar: how so? yes, it is. for example, if I try the ajax url=SearchmarkSelectedArticlesJSON.action?evaluatedRecords[0].id=10672&evaluatedRecords[1].id=822', I'll get the evaluatedRecords List on the action populated with 2 objects accordingly
[12:56:36] <taplar> but that's not your ajax request
[12:56:39] <duch_kazatel> ^^^
[12:57:29] <taplar> you are doing type 'post' which would put the parameters in the body
[12:57:48] <taplar> -that- request, i'm asking if it works with the backend
[12:58:45] <wild_oscar> taplar: well, not really, hence my question ;). it does go to the correct action in the backend, but the evaluatedRecords object is null instead of being populated as expected
[12:58:57] <shoky_> just make your struts2 server parse json :|
[12:59:01] <wild_oscar> the traditional: true yields a post evaluatedRecords=%5Bobject+Object%5D
[12:59:10] <duch_kazatel> lol
[12:59:12] <duch_kazatel> this guy
[12:59:23] <duch_kazatel> sounds like your box isn't parsing the object when it comes ir.
[12:59:25] <duch_kazatel> *in
[12:59:33] <shoky_> wild_oscar yea traditional:true would help with a simple array of values, not array of objects, sorry
[13:00:03] <shoky_> configure your backend to parse json
[13:00:18] <shoky_> or build the post data by hand...
[13:09:02] <wild_oscar> yeah, I'll try one of those approaches shoky_
[13:09:09] <wild_oscar> it seems either is possible
[13:17:02] <taplar> what about https://jsfiddle.net/d03b9o3b/
[13:21:46] <taplar> man i could use a nap today
[13:26:49] <wild_oscar> trying out the JSONInterceptor struts2 interceptor, which is trying to parse the json input
[13:28:18] <wild_oscar> taplar: yeah, tell me about it...working on my holiday. staff can't figure this one out, so either I do it or no one does it... :/
[13:32:35] <Aljone> hey guys i have some issue, im trying to draw on canvas on touch screen using jquery and html, i was reading this example http://www.williammalone.com/articles/create-html5-canvas-javascript-drawing-app/#demo-simple , if u look on the basic demo u can see its working but when i did it on my js fiddle or even clear html page its not working on touch https://jsfiddle.net/W4Km8/9561/
[13:32:39] <taplar> you have my condolences.  me and struts didn't get along
[13:32:55] <wild_oscar> taplar: struts1 or 2?
[13:33:47] <taplar> i'm not sure.  fortunately i never had to code in it, but one of my co workers who i went through the hiring process with had to do it.  and either it was very bad or he wasn't very good at explaining it, but i was lost as F* when he showed me the code
[13:34:39] <taplar> in fact my monitor is currently raised by a "struts in action" book.
[13:34:46] <taplar> i consider this the proper usage of the book, :D
[13:35:36] <wild_oscar> hehe
[13:36:32] <wild_oscar> struts2 is rather ok. similar to spring mvc. it's pretty much the same, it always baffled me why people would say "oh, you should code in spring. it's way cooler than struts"
[13:36:52] <taplar> does struts2 do all the autowire stuff too?
[13:36:56] <wild_oscar> yeah
[13:36:59] <taplar> nice
[13:38:10] <wild_oscar> I would look at spring and struts and: :/...huh...it's the same, dude. one uses controllers, the other uses actions...but you do realise it's only different names, right?
[13:38:18] <wild_oscar> btw: got it working I believe :)
[13:38:29] <taplar> awesome
[13:39:47] <wild_oscar> with: https://gist.github.com/mmalmeida/0119ee773f774903f225747c801ee38c
[13:40:19] <wild_oscar> and a JSON interceptor on the action,which parses the json input (and which is not plugged in by default)
[13:40:28] <taplar> makes sense
[13:41:38] <wild_oscar> if I rename var evaluatedRecords_JSON to json_parameters I guess the ajax code makes sense
[14:17:06] <jamiejackson> what do i need where `xxx` is to make a clone of this and remove all <br> tags? var mainNews = $('.announcement').clone() xxx ('br').remove()
[14:17:40] <duch_kazatel> mainNew.find('br').remove();
[14:18:56] <jamiejackson> duch_kazatel: okay, so two statements, then?
[14:19:07] <duch_kazatel> you can do it as one but i'm not a fan of that idea.
[14:19:39] <jamiejackson> duch_kazatel: why's that?
[14:19:55] <duch_kazatel> i hate when people chain everything together.
[14:21:17] <taplar> after a point it is like a run on sentence, ;)
[14:21:25] <jamiejackson> :)
[14:22:24] <taplar> though you have me curious.  how many announcements are on your page and how many time are you going to repeat this logic?
[14:22:40] <duch_kazatel> ^
[14:22:45] <duch_kazatel> great question
[14:24:24] <jamiejackson> i'm helping someone else, taplar. it's more about figuring out the right way to strip out the <br>s than the problem that it's a class selector and not an id. (i'll look at that later.)
[14:24:59] <taplar> well if all you want is to remove brs, why are you cloning?
[14:25:46] <jamiejackson> taplar, i think it's going to be placed somewhere else. i think maybe it's not an in-place edit.
[14:25:55] <jamiejackson> https://jsfiddle.net/grgnw7cc/ <= what am i doing wrong here? i just end up with the <br>s :) https://jsfiddle.net/grgnw7cc/
[14:26:01] <taplar> k.  just poking around
[14:27:30] <taplar> lol
[14:27:36] <taplar> so... think about what you are doing
[14:27:49] <duch_kazatel> ^^^
[14:27:58] <duch_kazatel> it's what remove does.
[14:30:22] <taplar> what you are really after is putting the html of the 'raw' into that other thing, after you've removed the brs
[14:30:56] <taplar> ooooh, left over sweettarts
[14:31:02] <robertmaxrees> haha
[14:31:20] <taplar> there's like a candy bucket on the corner of my table
[14:32:07] <taplar> mostly laffy taffy though, :(
[14:32:13] <jamiejackson> i had an unintentional mistake in that version of the fiddle. one sec. (i still have problems, but that wasn't one.)
[14:33:43] <jamiejackson> okay, so this is what i'd meant. it's still wrong, but... https://jsfiddle.net/grgnw7cc/1/
[14:33:52] <robertmaxrees> right.
[14:34:03] <robertmaxrees> .remove() returns the removed element.
[14:34:17] <jamiejackson> hah
[14:34:39] <jamiejackson> okay, lemme try to apply that knowledge...
[14:34:55] <robertmaxrees> pretty easy changes to make.
[14:35:41] <aramm> hi everyone, i'm struggling with some code where input click re-firing works in chrome but not IE11. basically i'm doing preventDefault, doing some other stuff, and then re-firing the click function with a flag that doesn't preventDefault. this works nicely in chrome but in IE11 nothing is happening at all when it gets to the "return" line despite the re-fire triggering. my code is here: https://jsfiddle.net/k8ndb8gu/ is there a known 
[14:36:39] <robertmaxrees> aramm that cut off, but pretty sure you care about the submit, not the click.
[14:36:41] <jamiejackson> here we go. https://jsfiddle.net/grgnw7cc/4/  works, but is there anything weird lingering?
[14:36:59] <Aljone> robertmaxrees: hey bro would u mind have a look at my issue?
[14:37:05] <Aljone>  im trying to draw on canvas on touch screen using jquery and html, i was reading this example http://www.williammalone.com/articles/create-html5-canvas-javascript-drawing-app/#demo-simple , if u look on the basic demo u can see its working but when i did it on my js fiddle or even clear html page its not working on touch https://jsfiddle.net/W4Km8/9561/
[14:37:59] <aramm> where did it cut off?
[14:38:17] <robertmaxrees> aramm after "is there a known"
[14:38:29] <robertmaxrees> Aljone mouusedown probably.
[14:38:42] <robertmaxrees> probably want touchstart instead for touch?
[14:38:43] <robertmaxrees> not sure.
[14:39:02] <Aljone> but in this example link it works perfectly and on real mouse its working aswell
[14:39:17] <robertmaxrees> so then where isn't it working?
[14:40:22] <Aljone> i have 2 links , the original article which all works there  and  copy paste on the code to jfiddle and there its not working using touch (real mouse works) i must tell u that all the tutorials i was looking on js canvas draw are NOT working with touch only mouse , but in this tutorial it does work on touch
[14:40:42] <Aljone> but only in HIS website ... using copy paste of the tutorial not working with touch
[14:40:51] <robertmaxrees> back up.
[14:40:57] <robertmaxrees> so the issue is that it's not working with touch in jsfiddle?
[14:41:09] <Aljone> and even not on fiddle
[14:41:14] <robertmaxrees> lol
[14:41:18] <robertmaxrees> soi where else don't they work?
[14:41:23] <Aljone> clear HTML with JUST his code not working with touch <
[14:41:31] <robertmaxrees> "clear html" huh?
[14:41:32] <taplar> do you have any touch bindings?
[14:41:50] <Aljone> no, i just copy paste his tutorial cuz it was working on his website
[14:41:52] <robertmaxrees> he says it works in some cases but not others.
[14:42:10] <Aljone> im saying its only work with touch on his website..
[14:42:15] <taplar> that webpage may be doing some touch bindings and just not have it documented
[14:42:26] <Aljone> so what are u suggesting?
[14:42:28] <robertmaxrees> Aljone show us a pags that doesn't work.
[14:42:32] <robertmaxrees> that isn't jsfiddle.
[14:42:34] <taplar> figure out how to do touch bindings, :)
[14:42:47] <taplar> don't rely on magic
[14:43:01] <Aljone> https://jsfiddle.net/W4Km8/9561/
[14:43:10] <robertmaxrees> that ISN'T a jsfiddle ;)
[14:43:16] <Aljone> it is
[14:43:31] <Aljone> why you say its not ?
[14:43:33] <robertmaxrees> right.  show us a case that's broken for touch that is not a jsfiddle.
[14:43:56] <taplar> and if possible put a border on the canvas or something
[14:44:04] * taplar whips out his phone in anticipation
[14:44:07] <Aljone> sure wait
[14:44:40] <Aljone> https://jsfiddle.net/W4Km8/9610/ < with border but let me upload it to clear html
[14:44:54] <taplar> wow that's a ton of updates
[14:45:00] <robertmaxrees> heh
[14:45:13] <Aljone> :)
[14:45:15] <robertmaxrees> something tells me that's one of those "starter" ones people just keep using.
[14:45:16] <Aljone> u wanted a border
[14:46:15] <taplar> so tap works for me, not drag
[14:46:37] <taplar> or touchmove iirc
[14:46:46] <jamiejackson> okay, a new question: i'd like to wrap the chunk of content that I've extracted in an <h2>: here's the fail: https://jsfiddle.net/grgnw7cc/5/
[14:46:50] <Aljone> yes exactly tap is working
[14:46:54] <Aljone> but not dragiing
[14:47:03] <robertmaxrees> right.
[14:47:06] <robertmaxrees> mousedown
[14:47:09] <Aljone> do u have suggestion?
[14:47:10] <robertmaxrees> doesn't esxist on mobile.
[14:47:13] <taplar> so whatever logic you are doing on mousedown, you need to do for touchstart
[14:47:19] <taplar> mousemove -> touchmove
[14:47:28] <Aljone> but im not using mobile
[14:47:34] <Aljone> im using desktop pc with touch screen
[14:47:35] <taplar> huh?
[14:47:38] <taplar> oh
[14:47:43] <taplar> wouldn't those events still happen?
[14:47:58] <robertmaxrees> jamiejackson you're doing wrapall with a selector, not an element.
[14:48:04] <robertmaxrees> also; you're wrapping them then moving them out of the wrapper.
[14:48:09] <Aljone> so u say i should change the mouse down to touchstart and so on?
[14:48:11] <robertmaxrees> need to change your order.
[14:48:19] <taplar> not change, add the additional ones
[14:48:23] <robertmaxrees> ^
[14:48:26] <Aljone> ok let me see
[14:48:26] <taplar> you want both to accomicate mouse and touch
[14:48:31] <taplar> accomidate
[14:48:44] <taplar> fk it
[14:48:44] <taplar> lol
[14:48:50] <robertmaxrees> *accommodate ;)
[14:49:02] <taplar> i need to use my spell checker more
[14:49:13] <aramm> robertmaxrees i tried changing it to just do a submit() after completing all the other actions, but this script is part of a drupal form and using that function screws up all sorts of field values :(
[14:49:30] <robertmaxrees> aramm oh, drupal.  i've got nothing.
[14:50:01] <aramm> does event refiring just not work at all in IE?
[14:50:06] <Aljone> https://jsfiddle.net/W4Km8/9611/ so thats basicly ?
[14:50:19] <taplar> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/TouchEvent for reference too
[14:50:31] <Aljone> lets try
[14:51:32] <taplar> these events may not be bindable with jquery like you are used to
[14:51:36] <taplar> you need to use on() instead
[14:51:47] <taplar> on('touchstart', function(){});
[14:51:59] <taplar> etc.
[14:52:48] <taplar> also, don't duplicate your methods
[14:52:59] <taplar> extract the common logic into a single function and give that to your event bindings
[14:53:24] <Aljone> i see
[14:53:50] <taplar> function whatever(){}    $(blah).on('click', whatever);
[14:55:07] <Aljone> i cahnged it
[14:55:10] <Aljone> but now nothing
[14:55:19] <jamiejackson> robertmaxrees: about selector vs. element: i'm not sure how to deal with the element vs the selector
[14:55:43] <robertmaxrees> $('<h2>') vs $('h2')
[14:55:45] <robertmaxrees> :)
[14:55:49] <Aljone> https://jsfiddle.net/W4Km8/9613/
[14:56:15] <taplar> take out the comma between the events
[14:56:47] <taplar> commas would be used for selectors.  specifying events you just space separate if there are multiple
[14:57:27] <Aljone> https://jsfiddle.net/W4Km8/9614/
[14:57:34] <Aljone> anyway its still not working
[14:58:11] <robertmaxrees> hey Aljone you realize it's probably going to take some refactoring to get this to work properly, right?
[14:58:30] <robertmaxrees> adding a few words and saying "it's not working" isn't going to get you very far :D
[14:58:42] <Aljone> i just added the touch events
[14:58:47] <Aljone> i dont know what else to do
[14:58:59] <Aljone> i dont see any reason why its not working properly really
[14:59:05] <robertmaxrees> maybe you should chjeck out the documentatioon taplar linked.
[14:59:16] <Aljone> i did
[14:59:21] <robertmaxrees> really
[14:59:25] <robertmaxrees> ?  and you read all of it?
[15:00:00] <Aljone> no i just readed about touchmove
[15:00:07] <robertmaxrees> heh
[15:00:11] <robertmaxrees> so go read :D
[15:00:33] <Aljone> do u see something i did wrong>?
[15:00:45] <robertmaxrees> good luck :)
[15:01:02] <jamiejackson> okay, latest fail, attempting to use an element and not a selector: https://jsfiddle.net/grgnw7cc/7/
[15:01:33] <taplar> Aljone: make sure all the properties on the event that you are trying to access, exist for the events you are processing.
[15:01:36] <robertmaxrees> jamiejackson right, so you wrap them with h2s, and then move those same elements.
[15:01:45] <Aljone> ok let em see again
[15:01:52] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/grgnw7cc/8/ jamiejackson
[15:02:02] <robertmaxrees> wanna wrap AFTER the html.
[15:05:53] * taplar beatboxes
[15:08:54] <robertmaxrees> boom
[15:09:07] <taplar> side note, i figured out my blackberry 10 issue
[15:09:15] <jamiejackson> thanks for that, robertmaxrees. now i'm trying to get rid of the <div class="announcement"> wrapper, and i assume i want unwrap(), but i'm not having any luck with it
[15:09:36] <jamiejackson> (remove it from the placed content, that is)
[15:09:51] <taplar> jamiejackson: don't insert it in the first place
[15:09:56] <robertmaxrees> ^
[15:10:32] <jamiejackson> grab its content at the outset, you mean?
[15:10:48] <taplar> you are append(content)
[15:11:11] <taplar> which is the whole thing, when really you are just wanting to append the contents innerHTML
[15:14:45] <Aljone> taplar seems like using the code from the DOC its working
[15:14:56] <Aljone> i didnt investigate it more cuz of lake of time
[15:15:18] <Aljone> last question, im saving the entire HTML , i wonder if i can save the html and what the user draw
[15:17:04] <jamiejackson> hallelujah: https://jsfiddle.net/grgnw7cc/9/
[15:47:08] <plamb_> can you attach to click events on an <option> ?
[15:47:17] <robertmaxrees> sure though I wouldn't suggest it.
[15:47:21] <plamb_> why's that
[15:47:31] <robertmaxrees> because you don't care about when they were clicked.
[15:47:39] <robertmaxrees> you care about when the option element changed.
[15:47:46] <plamb_> should one just never use select/option
[15:47:50] <plamb_> oh
[15:49:10] <ilhami> hey!
[15:50:35] <robertmaxrees> good afternoon
[15:50:44] <plamb_> robertmaxrees: like this? $('select').on('change','option',function({}))
[15:50:51] <robertmaxrees> just the select.
[15:50:54] <robertmaxrees> the select is what changes.
[15:50:56] <ilhami> robertmaxrees, evening here.
[15:51:00] <plamb_> i see
[15:51:10] <robertmaxrees> ilhami FST ;)  all relative, yo.
[15:55:13] <MichalS> hey, I need some help in jquery ui slider
[15:56:31] <robertmaxrees> hullo
[15:56:50] <MichalS> is tehere a way to get all values between the current slider value, and the value I click on the slider track
[15:56:53] <MichalS> ?
[15:57:03] <robertmaxrees> "all the values"
[15:57:17] <robertmaxrees> why not just compare the original to the new?
[15:57:40] <MichalS> i would like to do a led dimmer
[15:58:07] <robertmaxrees> don't need all the values for that.
[15:58:10] <MichalS> when I click on a slider track somewhere
[15:58:16] <plamb_> why am i getting an unexpected token error on this code: console.log($(this).html())
[15:58:18] <robertmaxrees> just nab the current one, then get get the new value.
[15:59:01] <MichalS> how can I get the current one?
[15:59:26] <robertmaxrees> store it somewhere.
[15:59:31] <Zzaichik> on page load, get the value, then get the new value on change/click event
[15:59:36] <robertmaxrees> ^
[15:59:42] <Lerak> Hey. How can I access some divs that are shown in the DOM but not in the page source?
[15:59:49] <Lerak> And why aren't some divs shown in the DOM also in the page source?
[15:59:54] <robertmaxrees> Lerak you can access them normally.
[16:00:04] <robertmaxrees> and they were dynamically added.
[16:00:04] <Lerak> How? It doesn't work.
[16:00:08] <robertmaxrees> via ajax or some other means.
[16:00:11] <robertmaxrees> define "access"
[16:00:22] <Lerak> Oh so not using getElementsByClassName for instance?
[16:00:31] <robertmaxrees> you can use that
[16:00:33] <robertmaxrees> or $()
[16:00:40] <Lerak> getElements..won't work.
[16:00:46] <robertmaxrees> huh?>
[16:00:47] <robertmaxrees> page?
[16:00:50] <Lerak> I get undefined.
[16:01:19] <plamb_> hmmm
[16:01:25] <robertmaxrees> well tjat'll happen if you run your code before the nodes are added.
[16:01:34] <MichalS> should I use ui.value?
[16:01:37] <plamb_> robertmaxrees: how would i attach to whichever option is clicked on
[16:01:54] <robertmaxrees> plamb_ why do you need the current option?
[16:01:58] <robertmaxrees> do you just want the value?
[16:02:02] <Lerak> robertmaxrees: I'm creating a chrome extension and using a content script.
[16:02:04] <plamb_> hmmm
[16:02:09] <robertmaxrees> Lerak that's why.
[16:02:10] <plamb_> yes
[16:02:16] <plamb_> the value of the option that becomes the select i guess
[16:02:21] <robertmaxrees> plamb_ then $(this).val()
[16:02:22] <MichalS> I want the value before click and after the click
[16:02:26] <robertmaxrees> yep :)
[16:02:31] <Lerak> robertmaxrees: Oh so the content scripts run before the page load?
[16:02:33] <Lerak> Didn't know that.
[16:02:35] <robertmaxrees> MichalS iirc youll need to store that first one.
[16:02:38] <robertmaxrees> Lerak not necessarily.
[16:02:45] <plamb_> ah, that worked
[16:02:50] <robertmaxrees> Lerak there might be bits ajaxing content in for you.
[16:02:51] <Lerak> Is there any way around that?
[16:03:00] <robertmaxrees> wait for the window load and hope that's enough.
[16:03:06] <robertmaxrees> but what are you doing?
[16:03:16] <robertmaxrees> are you trying to bind event listeners or something?
[16:03:46] <Lerak> I have to say I'm a beginner when it comes to JS and listeners etc..I'm a scientist working mostly with C, C++ and Python so this is new
[16:03:52] <Lerak> If you could dumb it down a bit :)
[16:03:53] <robertmaxrees> sure.
[16:03:58] <robertmaxrees> so what are you trying to do?
[16:04:16] <Lerak> Well, I'm trying to edit specific divs in a given webpage.
[16:04:33] <Lerak> say, <div class="stats">some info..</div>
[16:04:56] <Lerak> But I guess that "some info.." is loaded rather than hard coded.
[16:05:14] <robertmaxrees> it could be ajaxed in, yes.
[16:05:17] <Zzaichik> first things first: the dom and page source aren't necessarily going to be the same.
[16:05:25] <robertmaxrees> ^ already covered that ;)
[16:05:31] <Zzaichik> oh sorry - haha
[16:06:38] <Lerak> So in my content script, can I just use jQuery right away without linking the file?
[16:06:50] <robertmaxrees> that depends on a whole lot of factors.
[16:07:05] <robertmaxrees> is the content script getting loaded after the jquery file?
[16:07:26] <ilhami> https://dpaste.de/8nsz how can I do this? if .sub-menu has an active li then I want to remove the collapse on only that .sub-menu
[16:07:42] <ilhami> now it removes collapse on all sub menus
[16:07:55] <robertmaxrees> because you're doing $('.sub-menu').removeClass('collapse'); :)
[16:07:59] <Lerak> robertmaxrees: To be honest, I have no idea.
[16:08:00] <robertmaxrees> you want a .filter()
[16:08:10] <robertmaxrees> Lerak you can't use jquery if it hasn't loaded.
[16:08:18] <robertmaxrees> but don';t just inject it into the page.
[16:08:23] <robertmaxrees> you can break things if you're not careful.
[16:08:26] <Lerak> Maybe I could use DOMContentLoaded?
[16:08:40] <robertmaxrees> Lerak sounds like you want ##javascript.
[16:08:46] <robertmaxrees> and do this without JQ :)
[16:09:06] <ilhami> So I want a .filter() ? :D
[16:09:16] <robertmaxrees> ilhami yeah.  witha  function.
[16:10:51] <Lerak> robertmaxrees: Would you suggest doing this wihout JQ?
[16:11:04] <robertmaxrees> Lerak hones i'm not sure.  probably.
[16:11:09] <robertmaxrees> *honestly
[16:15:31] <ilhami> robertmaxrees, are you sure filter is the best way? :/
[16:15:53] <robertmaxrees> ilhami it'd the way i'd do it.  why?
[16:15:59] <robertmaxrees> what're you running into?
[16:16:46] <ilhami> I could assign each sub-menu an ID but that's just a bad way.
[16:16:52] <robertmaxrees> ... right.
[16:16:56] <robertmaxrees> so just use .filkter()
[16:17:01] <robertmaxrees> what's the problem
[16:17:40] <ilhami> well I can try.
[16:18:31] <ilhami> didn't know jQuery had a .grep function lol
[16:18:37] <robertmaxrees> it sure does.
[16:18:39] <robertmaxrees> no need for it here.
[16:19:33] <ilhami> I know I know.. Just stumbled upon it. Bbl.
[16:20:01] <cannap> http://adventofcode.com/ dont miss :D
[16:38:08] <plamb_> is there anything syntactically wrong with this function definition?
[16:38:10] <plamb_> http://pastebin.com/93FB7k5D
[16:38:49] <plamb_> its coming back undefined, but i've checked every step and every step works as expected
[16:39:29] <robertmaxrees> plamb_ could you put it in contxt?
[16:39:53] <plamb_> hmm
[16:39:58] <plamb_> click on a dropdown
[16:40:09] <plamb_> the value of that dropdown (<option>) gets sent to that function
[16:40:41] <plamb_> im trying to return only those results where the value === the text() inside a <p> elem
[16:40:43] <robertmaxrees> that's not how you use filter btw.
[16:40:59] <plamb_> what should i be using here then
[16:41:09] <robertmaxrees> a function
[16:41:14] <plamb_> oh, within it
[16:41:36] <plamb_> im so used to writing scala using scala-like methods throws me off
[16:41:50] <robertmaxrees> https://bpaste.net/show/1dbe5ed58b57
[16:41:54] <robertmaxrees> like this.
[16:42:55] <plamb_> bleh
[16:43:51] <plamb_> robertmaxrees: https://bpaste.net/show/126c5e428af6
[16:43:54] <plamb_> theres all the code
[16:44:06] <plamb_> still returning undefined
[16:44:15] <robertmaxrees> make a fiddle yo.
[16:44:24] <plamb_> feelings
[16:44:33] <plamb_> so you dont see anything immediately wrong with that
[16:45:16] <robertmaxrees> it looks really strainge.
[16:45:25] <robertmaxrees> $allResources isn't scoped.
[16:46:04] <robertmaxrees> also you need to return from that filter.
[16:46:13] <plamb_> so a return within it?
[16:46:29] <robertmaxrees> rep.
[16:46:32] <robertmaxrees> *yep
[16:46:46] <plamb_> okay thats what it was
[16:46:48] <plamb_> finally
[16:48:30] <bjsnider> is there a way to access a var by using a combination of a var + string? ie. the var i want is called var + string
[16:48:45] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[16:48:52] <robertmaxrees> fiddle or something?
[16:52:37] <taplar> someobject[ aVariable +'State' ] ?
[16:58:37] <bjsnider> i've got var thisThing = "whatever"; and i'm trying to use it with val(this + "Thing")
[16:58:40] <plamb_> robertmaxrees: why does this only return on of the li's
[16:58:41] <plamb_> https://jsfiddle.net/56r7t7x5/
[16:58:48] <bjsnider> and instead thisThing is echoed
[16:59:16] <plamb_> one*
[16:59:40] <plamb_> or taplar for that matter
[17:02:25] <robertmaxrees> aaaaand back
[17:02:40] <robertmaxrees> bjoe2k4 you can't access vars like that.
[17:02:44] <robertmaxrees> err, bjsnider
[17:03:25] <bjsnider> robertmaxrees: i know i'm missing something, braces or a $ or something
[17:03:27] <robertmaxrees> plamb_ http://api.jquery.com/html/ -> "Description: Get the HTML contents of the first element in the set of matched elements."
[17:03:42] <robertmaxrees> bjsnider you cannot access variables by concatenating strings together.
[17:03:47] <robertmaxrees> not safely, at least.
[17:04:14] <robertmaxrees> you can access properties that way, though
[17:04:16] <plamb_> hmm
[17:04:24] <plamb_> okay so how would i return the HTML of all the li's
[17:04:56] <robertmaxrees> well.
[17:05:10] <robertmaxrees> if .html() gets you the html contents of the first element...
[17:05:13] <robertmaxrees> what do you think you'd do?
[17:05:29] <plamb_> something lame like iterating and returning the html of each element
[17:05:38] <robertmaxrees> nope
[17:05:46] <robertmaxrees> remove that .children()
[17:05:51] <robertmaxrees> you just want the UL.
[17:05:53] <plamb_> o-oh
[17:05:55] <plamb_> lmao
[17:05:58] <robertmaxrees> because its contents are the LIs ;)
[17:06:54] <plamb_> in terms of using that filter from above though
[17:07:00] <plamb_> i'd need to get the children first
[17:07:03] <hassoon> isn't  input:radio:checked true as a selector ?
[17:07:17] <robertmaxrees> wut
[17:07:22] <robertmaxrees> plamb_ make a fiddle.
[17:07:36] <robertmaxrees> pls
[17:08:28] <plamb_> like, if i do something like ('ul').filter(...) its not looking at the inner elements of the <ul>
[17:08:37] <robertmaxrees> bruh
[17:08:40] <robertmaxrees> pls
[17:08:45] <plamb_> :(
[17:09:07] <robertmaxrees> you're so close to having one.
[17:09:12] <plamb_> lol
[17:11:47] <plamb_> okay here it is: https://jsfiddle.net/56r7t7x5/1/
[17:11:55] <robertmaxrees> yaaaay
[17:12:22] <robertmaxrees> does that var really need to be global?
[17:12:40] <plamb_> it seems its the only way to get back to "all" resources if someone re-selects "all"
[17:12:50] <robertmaxrees> back way up.
[17:12:54] <plamb_> :(
[17:12:55] <robertmaxrees> heh
[17:13:10] <robertmaxrees> so when you select "docs", what should happen?
[17:13:28] <plamb_> only the <li> with the "docs" in that div should be displayed
[17:13:30] <plamb_> within the <ul>
[17:13:33] <robertmaxrees> displayed.
[17:13:39] <robertmaxrees> that's key.
[17:13:41] <robertmaxrees> $('.lower').html(newResources.html()) is bad.
[17:13:56] <plamb_> yeah something didnt feel right about that
[17:14:02] <robertmaxrees> don't replace markup like this.
[17:14:07] <robertmaxrees> hide things using css.
[17:14:51] <plamb_> okay, so instead fo filtering apply display:none;
[17:15:00] <robertmaxrees> no, you're still going to filter.
[17:15:12] <plamb_> and display none the results
[17:15:13] <plamb_> err
[17:15:18] <plamb_> the non-results LoL
[17:15:23] <robertmaxrees> heh
[17:15:26] <robertmaxrees> you stiull want the filter.
[17:16:51] <robertmaxrees> heh this is awkward one sec.
[17:18:15] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/56r7t7x5/3/
[17:21:52] <bjsnider> robertmaxrees: you think it would be better to substitute an html tag for the var, and then use that with val?
[17:23:02] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[17:23:13] <taplar> i'm lost on the context of that question
[17:23:19] <robertmaxrees> yeah you lost us.
[17:23:34] <robertmaxrees> back way up - why do you want to dynamically access var names?
[17:23:46] <robertmaxrees> you're not dynamically generating them server-side, are you?
[17:24:00] <bjsnider> well, i'll just try it
[17:24:08] <robertmaxrees> ...
[17:24:09] <robertmaxrees> heh
[17:24:31] <taplar> hard for us to offer suggestions for a problem when we don't know what the problem is mate
[17:24:38] <robertmaxrees> ^^^^
[17:24:42] <robertmaxrees> lack of context and all that.
[17:25:27] <ilhami> I really suck at jQuery. :/
[17:25:46] <ilhami> robertmaxrees, didn't manage to make that function yet.
[17:26:16] <gambl0re> whats the best way to learn animations?
[17:26:27] <gambl0re> i know theres so many libraries to do these things
[17:26:47] <taplar> personally i'd point you to animate.css
[17:26:51] <gambl0re> but which is most commonly used or do people just stick with css3?
[17:27:06] <gambl0re> i dont want to do simple animations
[17:27:15] <ilhami> what kind of animations do you want then?
[17:27:29] <gambl0re> like transition animations, i want to do complex, mind blowing stuff
[17:27:37] <ilhami> lol
[17:27:53] <gambl0re> you know what i mean?
[17:28:01] <ilhami> some browsers support 3d css
[17:28:04] <gambl0re> i dont want to do fade in fade out stuff
[17:28:20] <taplar> i've never been to a website where i thought -both- "this is awesome!" and "this is useful!" in regards to animations
[17:28:37] <ilhami> more like "this is annoying".
[17:28:42] <taplar> usually
[17:28:50] <sillyslux> haha ture
[17:28:52] <sillyslux> true
[17:29:04] <ilhami> :-D
[17:29:14] <taplar> and i've seen some awesome css stuff.  just don't see it as being useful for prod use
[17:29:28] <sillyslux> awesome is good enough
[17:29:34] <taplar> unless i guess your trying to do a game or something
[17:30:01] <gambl0re> it doesnt always have to be useful....some people like aesthetically appleasing websites
[17:30:09] <sillyslux> design is not everything, but without design everything is nothing
[17:30:21] <gambl0re> appeasing
[17:30:30] <Pyro100> If you want to do hover effects this is a pretty useful website https://ianlunn.github.io/Hover/
[17:30:37] <taplar> idk.  i think design supports content.  it isn't content
[17:30:56] <taplar> imho
[17:30:58] <robertmaxrees> lol
[17:31:01] <sillyslux> when there is no content you need even more design
[17:31:03] <gambl0re> like i said i dontc care about hover animations
[17:31:09] <ilhami> sillyslux, lol
[17:31:15] <robertmaxrees> "aesthetically appleasing websites" then learn how to design well.
[17:31:33] <gambl0re> i corrected myself...
[17:31:36] <robertmaxrees> "aesthetically pleasing" and "flashy animations" are one in the same.
[17:31:46] <robertmaxrees> *not
[17:31:49] <robertmaxrees> NOT one in the same
[17:31:58] <gambl0re> aestically pleasing
[17:31:59] <gambl0re> there
[17:32:07] <robertmaxrees> i wasn't criticizing your spelling.
[17:32:13] <robertmaxrees> i'm criticizing the sentiment.
[17:32:33] <gambl0re> why you even talking to me? you always ignore me anyways
[17:32:45] <robertmaxrees> *sigh*
[17:33:02] <robertmaxrees> good luck then buddy
[17:33:03] <gambl0re> just put me on ignore
[17:33:07] <gambl0re> good luck to you too
[17:33:25] <sillyslux> haha the fight ended before it began
[17:33:40] <robertmaxrees> heh, looong story
[17:33:52] <taplar> i'm more focused now on Boobie
[17:34:09] <taplar> and how they used to be Boobie_
[17:34:18] <taplar> ya know, under Boobie
[17:34:20] <gambl0re> anyone use greensock?
[17:34:23] <gambl0re> looks good
[17:34:23] <sillyslux> i like the Boobies too
[17:34:25] * taplar manager laughs
[17:34:28] <Boobie> (.)
[17:34:56] <ilhami> lol
[17:35:16] <gambl0re> holy crap https://greensock.com/?example=howls-moving-castle
[17:35:20] <Pyro100> So i need some help, I need to read a huge xml file > http://store.steampowered.com/feeds/daily_deals.xml and get the first <title> entry in the first <item> entry, how would i go about this?
[17:35:25] <ilhami> LOL!
[17:36:06] <sillyslux> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/Parsing_and_serializing_XML
[17:36:15] <robertmaxrees> Pyro100 does that even support CORS?
[17:36:17] <sillyslux> there's also some packages on npm
[17:36:33] <taplar> https://api.jquery.com/jQuery.parseXML/ also exists, never used it though
[17:36:48] <sillyslux> oh didn't know that
[17:36:56] <Pyro100> No but i already got that covered
[17:37:02] <robertmaxrees> the CORS part?
[17:37:08] <Pyro100> yeah
[17:37:09] <robertmaxrees> then yeah, parseXML or the native way.
[17:37:29] <sillyslux> what's the native way?
[17:37:39] <robertmaxrees> what you linked.
[17:37:47] <sillyslux> ha
[17:37:51] <robertmaxrees> :)
[17:39:09] <sillyslux> i hate picking flowers
[17:39:19] <taplar> wow
[17:39:20] <sillyslux> and fonts and colors and borders and whatnot
[17:39:55] <Pyro100> theres nothing against linking codepen pens and asking for help here right?
[17:40:05] <robertmaxrees> newp
[17:40:09] <robertmaxrees> we prefer it
[17:40:13] <Pyro100> cool
[17:41:05] <sillyslux> prefer, as in pen/fiddle yes, pastebin not
[17:42:05] <Pyro100> also the xml file is like ~5000 entries, will that be any problem?
[17:42:21] <taplar> total size?
[17:42:24] <robertmaxrees> filesize is the issue
[17:42:38] <sillyslux> yeah, i don't have much megabytes
[17:42:39] <robertmaxrees> don't link something that'll slow down/crash somebody's stuff
[17:43:11] <taplar> i got bytes out the azz!  *loves his new laptop*
[17:43:30] <sillyslux> aww
[17:44:09] <sillyslux> i'm still using my 8" sony with 1st gen atom cpu
[17:44:26] <Pyro100> Its an online xml file
[17:44:40] <sillyslux> well offline would be bad
[17:44:52] <taplar> nyce
[17:44:53] <Pyro100> so im not really sure how to check the filesize
[17:45:12] <taplar> you were only interested in getting something from the first record, right?
[17:45:17] <sillyslux> chrome devtools network panel
[17:45:32] <sillyslux> first record?
[17:45:42] <taplar> i thought that's what he was asking for
[17:46:07] <sillyslux> ah yes  first <title> entry in the first <item> entry
[17:46:07] <taplar> i call xml nodes records for some reason
[17:46:22] <sillyslux> does make sense
[17:46:36] <Pyro100> Yea taplar
[17:46:44] <taplar> then you really just need two of them
[17:46:50] <taplar> to show that you target the first one only
[17:47:25] <ilhami> What does $(this) refer to in jQuery? :)
[17:47:41] <robertmaxrees> generally it's the jquerfied current element.
[17:47:51] <Pyro100> taplar what do you mean
[17:48:07] <ilhami> robertmaxrees, ok I got it.
[17:49:35] <taplar> hmm?  i'm just saying if you want to make a minimum example, then two records would be enough
[17:49:52] <taplar> if there was only one, your not really ruling out that you are not picking the 'last' record
[17:50:11] <Pyro100> here let me show you what i have so far
[17:51:41] <Pyro100> http://codepen.io/Pyro100/pen/rWYgRR
[17:52:15] <robertmaxrees> Pyro100 why not process this in your backend?
[17:52:28] <Pyro100> I'm trying to make an info board from a raspberry pi and a laptop screen
[17:54:10] <Pyro100> robertmaxres What do you mean?
[17:54:22] <robertmaxrees> you can process all this data in your backend instead of in jquery land.
[17:54:28] <robertmaxrees> probably be a bit faster there.
[17:55:40] <Pyro100> And how would i do that?
[17:55:43] <taplar> the ajax call is getting some error
[17:56:53] <Pyro100> yeah its CORS
[17:57:24] <taplar> i had to put processData: false on it before i could see that CORS error
[17:57:26] <Pyro100> i have a firefox extension that disables it for now
[17:58:15] <robertmaxrees> O.o
[17:59:02] <Sayona> Hello all
[17:59:32] <ilhami> robertmaxrees, I solved it man
[17:59:35] <ilhami> without filter.
[17:59:54] <ilhami> https://dpaste.de/Drdq that did it.. lol
[18:00:03] <Pyro100> If you can't already tell this is the first project i've used jquery in
[18:00:04] <ilhami> probably a bad solution.
[18:06:17] <hassoon> i'm confused, what's the difference between $('tr') and $('<tr>') ?
[18:06:35] <taplar> the first selects by tagName, the second creates a new element
[18:07:29] <hassoon> taplar: i mean varName=$('<tr>'); in the second case
[18:07:34] <taplar> yep
[18:07:45] <taplar> same answer
[18:08:23] <hassoon> so if a new tr element is added to the DOM, what's varName for then ?
[18:08:36] <taplar> it's not added to the DOM.  it's detached
[18:08:59] <taplar> not all elements have to exist in the dom
[18:09:34] <hassoon> taplar: d'oh you mean it's a mere string until it's appended to the DOM
[18:09:39] <taplar> no
[18:09:48] <hassoon> taplar: i mean the varName
[18:09:55] <taplar> no, it's not a string
[18:09:59] <taplar> it's an Element
[18:10:10] <taplar> a jQuery wrapped Element
[18:10:33] <taplar> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element
[18:11:02] <taplar> which do not have to be attached to the DOM, but they are not just 'strings'
[18:11:19] <hassoon> taplar: oley, if i don't do $(dom_element).append(varName); what's varName for
[18:11:27] <hassoon> isn't it a string containing the html of an element ?
[18:11:39] <taplar> it's a variable referencing the jQuery object
[18:12:18] <taplar> typically you'd create your element, do whatever manipulation you wanted to it for initialization, and then append it
[18:12:44] <hassoon> okey i'm overthinking about it i guess
[18:13:04] <taplar> so long as it is not attached to the DOM, every change to it will never cause the page to need to do a redraw/reflow
[18:16:19] <sillyslux> you could do varName.addClass('someclass') before attaching to the dom, you can't do that with a string
[18:23:24] <Pyro100> So I used the XML parsing method that sillyslux posted, and it led me to this code console.log(xhr.responseXML.documentElement.nodeName); which returns rdf:RDF, which is the first element in the xml file, but im wondering how to get the content of a certain node with regex
[18:27:29] <taplar> it looks like responseXML has methods on it such as getElementsByTagName
[18:27:42] <sillyslux> console.log() the topmost element and examine in the console
[18:27:59] <sillyslux> in this case xhr
[18:28:07] <sillyslux> which makes me wonder...
[18:28:17] <sillyslux> why would you name your variable xhr
[18:29:08] <Pyro100> X ml H ttp R equest
[18:29:09] <taplar> XMLHttpRequest ?
[18:29:21] <sillyslux> var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
[18:29:24] <sillyslux> found it :)
[18:30:06] <Pyro100> Wait is my codepen updating live for you guys?
[18:33:35] <sillyslux> actually...
[18:33:53] <sillyslux> this is what i had used https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Archive/JXON#Appendix_a_complete_bidirectional_JXON_library
[18:37:18] <Pyro100> Okay so I'm using this code > console.log(xhr.responseXML.getElementsByTagName("Item")); but its returning a html collection with a length of 0
[18:37:43] <taplar> lookes like it is "item" in the markup
[18:37:54] <taplar> err "items"
[18:40:03] <taplar> i hope you are not planning on loading this file repeatedly
[18:40:29] <Pyro100> Well once an hour
[18:40:45] <taplar> k
[18:42:43] <Pyro100> "<title xmlns='http://purl.org/rss/1.0/'><![CDATA[Daily Deal - Devolver Digital Hidden Gems Bundle, 50% Off]]></title>" WOO HOO!
[18:42:59] <Pyro100> Thank you all so much
[18:43:13] <taplar> cool
[18:47:12] <sillyslux> that jxon also took care of those <![CDATA[...]]> things
[18:47:56] <Pyro100> They're not any problem i can just regex them out
[18:51:43] <snover> oh dear.
[18:52:34] <robertmaxrees> ?
[18:52:47] <snover> “i can just regex them out”
[18:52:52] <robertmaxrees> heh
[18:53:12] <snover> http://stackoverflow.com/a/1732454/252087
[18:53:37] <robertmaxrees> yaaaaaay
[18:54:33] <hellyeah> yo
[18:55:12] <taplar> aloha
[18:55:27] <taplar> disregard robert, he's just happy my little pony came on
[18:56:00] <hellyeah> have a small question
[18:56:10] <robertmaxrees> shoot
[18:59:06] * snover shoots
[18:59:07] <taplar> 8|
[18:59:46] <hellyeah> it is spesific question i hope someone knows it or suggest something to me. When you drag and drop button onto another one div will be created you can create lots of div with that way. Also you can transfer one button from a div into another div. Also you can create a div by draggşng button from a div onto another div that doesnt belong any droppablediv. I hope it is understandable i cannot
[19:00:05] <hellyeah> position buttons correctly. Any tips? http://jsfiddle.net/hellyeah/0s2s1uvf/12/
[19:00:24] <taplar> that's a flashback
[19:01:29] <bjsnider> this is what i was discussing earlier: https://jsfiddle.net/y7nLvvtu/
[19:01:40] <bjsnider> is there a way that works?
[19:01:45] <hellyeah> i asked that before if it is what you meant taplar
[19:02:10] <robertmaxrees> wut
[19:02:27] <hellyeah> wut to who? :D
[19:02:34] <robertmaxrees> to bjsnider
[19:02:47] <robertmaxrees> are you trying to reset fields in a given area?
[19:03:37] <bjsnider> i would have to say no, based on the research i did
[19:03:42] <robertmaxrees> bjsnider var className = $('.buttonselector').attr('class').split(' ')[1]; this is really weird.
[19:03:54] <robertmaxrees> so you want to set values to a particular string in a class?
[19:04:20] <bjsnider> the values could be changed in the db, and i want to offer to set them back to their original defaults
[19:04:30] <robertmaxrees> use data attributes instead.
[19:05:44] <hellyeah> guess no answer at that moment
[19:06:00] <taplar> you said it was a small question, :)
[19:06:07] <bjsnider> that line gets the 2nd class. that line works
[19:06:23] <robertmaxrees> bjsnider "the 2nd class" is ephemeral and error-prone.
[19:06:39] <hellyeah> taplar:  small question but big statement behind it :D
[19:07:04] <bjsnider> robertmaxrees: if there's a betetr way i am very open to suggestion
[19:07:18] <robertmaxrees> yeah - use data attributes on the inputs instead :)
[19:07:19] <robertmaxrees> one sec.
[19:08:03] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/y7nLvvtu/1/
[19:08:07] <firespeaker> taplar: why is your ISP dillard's ?
[19:08:17] <taplar> shsss
[19:08:31] <robertmaxrees> haha
[19:08:40] <robertmaxrees> because he HACKED THEM.
[19:08:45] <robertmaxrees> jay kay
[19:08:48] <taplar> why you checking out my P man?
[19:09:31] <robertmaxrees> bjsnider get the idea?
[19:09:38] <bjsnider> robertmaxrees: data-defaultvalue? never heard of it
[19:09:44] <hellyeah> wow that was quick
[19:09:44] <robertmaxrees> data-* attributes.
[19:09:47] <bjsnider> is that a thing or did you just dummy it up?
[19:09:56] <robertmaxrees> data attributes are a thing.
[19:10:00] <robertmaxrees> see that .data() use?
[19:10:07] <hellyeah> bjsnider:  data-* you can name it anything you like
[19:10:14] <bjsnider> i get it
[19:10:30] <robertmaxrees> great for storing data on a node if you need to.
[19:11:55] <bjsnider> it's very similar to something i saw for either textarea or input, i forget the name of it, but it would just sit there grayed out if the field was empty
[19:12:09] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[19:12:10] <bjsnider> but the dvantage here is it doesn't sit there grayed out
[19:12:15] <taplar> firespeaker blew my cover and now i have to run from guards.  thanks man.  >:(
[19:12:20] <taplar> later all
[19:12:44] <robertmaxrees> bjsnider 'kay.
[19:13:37] <bjsnider> robertmaxrees: placeholder. that's it. you can add an attribute called placeholder that holds a default value for textarea, but i didn't want to use that,
[19:13:54] <robertmaxrees> it's not really a default value, but yeah.
[19:13:58] <hellyeah> i used data attribute if i have multiple buttons for example. If i need to send different data to the backend. data attribute is really handy to store information. I store json string
[19:14:03] <bjsnider> no it isn't
[19:14:26] <robertmaxrees> hellyeah avoid storing JSON in data attributes.
[19:14:34] <robertmaxrees> while you CAN, it's something you generally want to avoid.
[19:14:54] <hellyeah> placeholder is just helper to show an example to the user what the text would be etc.
[19:15:05] <hellyeah> robertmaxrees:  spesific reason?
[19:15:12] <robertmaxrees> hellyeah sloppy code.
[19:15:13] <hellyeah> hmm
[19:15:13] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[19:15:21] <robertmaxrees> lol i thinbk he knows that, btw.
[19:15:23] <bjsnider> right, it was not appropriate
[19:15:24] <robertmaxrees> give the dude some credit.
[19:15:52] <hellyeah> understood
[19:16:20] <hellyeah> but it was helpful when i do ajax call hmm there must be another way then
[19:16:49] <firespeaker> lol taplar ... o_O
[19:16:53] <robertmaxrees> store an ID and then grab associated data out of an element elsehwere.
[19:16:56] <robertmaxrees> and taplar left ;)
[19:17:00] <robertmaxrees> he works for dillards though.
[19:17:07] <firespeaker> ah
[19:17:23] <firespeaker> I haven't lived anywhere where there's a Dillard's for like 10+ years
[19:17:30] <firespeaker> it's weird to see them as an ISP
[19:17:43] <robertmaxrees> haha, that's not necessarily your ISP, but yeah.
[19:17:53] <firespeaker> if it's where you're getting your internet, ...
[19:18:02] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[19:18:03] <robertmaxrees> heh
[19:18:12] <hellyeah> robertmaxrees:  can you share small example if you have time
[19:18:14] <hellyeah> ?
[19:18:15] <robertmaxrees> it's just the hostname that gets resolved when the lookup is done.
[19:18:35] <robertmaxrees> firespeaker i wouldn't call my employerr my ISP since they're not an ISP - that term has specific connotation.
[19:18:40] <sillyslux> You don't have permission to access "http://www.dillards.com/" on this server.
[19:18:41] <firespeaker> robertmaxrees: but I mean, he's using internet through them
[19:18:52] <robertmaxrees> that doesn't make them an ISP ;)
[19:19:00] <firespeaker> yeah they're such a good ISP they're blocked by other ISPs
[19:19:08] <firespeaker> I guess that's probably true
[19:19:15] <firespeaker> maybe they're an unintentional ISP
[19:19:16] <sillyslux> Access Denied...
[19:19:28] <robertmaxrees> *sigh*
[19:19:28] <firespeaker> like if I use McDonalds' wifi, they're my ISP for the day
[19:19:29] <robertmaxrees> welp
[19:19:32] <firespeaker> not legally or anything
[19:19:38] <robertmaxrees> they're not an ISP, but OK.
[19:19:51] <firespeaker> but they're providing me with internet service
[19:20:01] <robertmaxrees> ISP has a specific connotation.
[19:20:06] <robertmaxrees> but feel free to argue that route :)
[19:20:08] <robertmaxrees> anyway!
[19:20:18] <robertmaxrees> hellyeah i'm working on an example real quick.  one sec.
[19:20:52] <firespeaker> 1min, I'll change wikipedia's definition of ISP and we'll be good
[19:20:57] <robertmaxrees> oh ffs
[19:20:58] <robertmaxrees> drop it.
[19:20:59] <robertmaxrees> yeesh
[19:21:03] <firespeaker> I'm just being silly
[19:21:24] <firespeaker> btw, thanks for all your help yesterday robertmaxrees
[19:21:32] <firespeaker> I got my thing doing most of what I wanted it to
[19:21:35] <firespeaker> jquery is like magic
[19:21:46] <robertmaxrees> I... don't recall what i helped with, but great!  i'm glad :)
[19:21:57] <firespeaker> filters, mostly
[19:22:02] <bjsnider> he never remembers the next day
[19:22:14] <firespeaker> lol
[19:22:16] <shoky_> all of you look the same
[19:22:22] <robertmaxrees> heh pretty much :)
[19:22:41] <hellyeah> robertmaxrees:  thank you so much
[19:22:59] <bjsnider> he goes to sleep at night by hitting himself in the forehead with a hammer
[19:23:23] <robertmaxrees> i drink enough that it's basically the same.
[19:23:31] <bjsnider> that explains it
[19:24:05] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/bygd43cx/ this is SUPER sloppy but you get the idea hellyeah
[19:24:21] <firespeaker> hell yeah he gets the idea
[19:24:47] <hellyeah> robertmaxrees:  sloopy you mean dirty code?
[19:25:03] <robertmaxrees> i mean it's sloppy - lazy.
[19:25:06] <robertmaxrees> not good.
[19:25:11] <robertmaxrees> wouldn't use in production.
[19:25:46] <hellyeah> i see
[19:25:58] <hellyeah> what is the reason of preventDefault there
[19:26:09] <hellyeah> actually i didnt understand what this method do
[19:26:11] <robertmaxrees> just habit tbh.
[19:26:19] <robertmaxrees> stops you from following that link.
[19:29:24] <hellyeah> understand
[19:29:30] <hellyeah> there was another method
[19:29:33] <hellyeah> what was that
[19:29:43] <hellyeah> hmm
[19:29:48] <robertmaxrees> there are lots of methods.
[19:30:07] <hellyeah> https://api.jquery.com/event.stoppropagation/
[19:30:18] <robertmaxrees> that stops the event from bubbling.
[19:30:28] <hellyeah> which case you both use ?
[19:30:40] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[19:30:44] <hellyeah> hmm
[19:30:52] <robertmaxrees> when do you use both you mean?
[19:31:12] <hellyeah> someone said to me you use stoppropagation and preventdefault together
[19:31:21] <robertmaxrees> not always.
[19:31:23] <robertmaxrees> sometimes.
[19:31:29] <robertmaxrees> or sometimes you use one or the other.
[19:32:56] <hellyeah> depends on the case
[19:33:01] <hellyeah> well
[19:33:27] <hellyeah> something always depend another thing. Wise lesson i learned back in the day
[19:33:51] <robertmaxrees> not sure how that relates here >.>
[19:34:24] <hellyeah> love to be philosopher :D anyways
[19:34:50] <hellyeah> actually what i do for avoiding events bubbling is to set .attr("disabled","true");
[19:34:59] <hellyeah> is that sloppy also?
[19:35:17] <robertmaxrees> that's not what that does, and yes that's sloppy.
[19:36:04] <hellyeah> it is just disable the element
[19:36:15] <hellyeah> it is still clickable but not doing anything
[19:37:18] <robertmaxrees> right so disabled is really only meant for form inputs and has specific semantic meaning.
[19:38:24] <bjsnider> wait, class is not an attribute of textarea
[19:38:51] <robertmaxrees> sure it is.
[19:39:07] <robertmaxrees> you can slap a class on tons of things.
[19:39:35] <hellyeah> id and class?
[19:39:47] <robertmaxrees> id, as well.
[19:39:51] <hellyeah> spesific semantic meaning?
[19:39:57] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[19:40:01] <hellyeah> sorry
[19:40:02] <bjsnider> ah, supports it as it is a global attribute
[19:40:08] <robertmaxrees> bjsnider yep.
[19:40:13] <hellyeah> bjsnider:  id and class is attr of html element
[19:40:25] <robertmaxrees> lol he already figured that out ;)
[19:40:26] <bjsnider> http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_textarea.asp
[19:40:42] <hellyeah> robertmaxrees:  not clear about  "spesific semantic meaning" part
[19:40:53] <robertmaxrees> bjsnider fwiw avoid w3schools
[19:40:54] <hellyeah> bjsnider:  dont use w3school people generally meantioned
[19:40:56] <robertmaxrees> check out MDN instead.
[19:41:18] <robertmaxrees> hellyeah "disabled" is for when you actually want to disable the element, not prevent a particular event on it.
[19:41:19] <bjsnider> the info is there under the gloabl attributes link
[19:43:09] <hellyeah> robertmaxrees:  i see
[19:43:42] <hellyeah> i was not able to use those two methods properly let me dig it more
[19:50:43] <taplar> escaped the man!
[19:51:22] <robertmaxrees> hella
[19:51:59] <hellyeah> and taplar did sneak into channel silently :D
[19:52:42] <hellyeah> robertmaxrees:  any suggestion about my draggable, droppable, sortable thing?
[19:52:53] <robertmaxrees> hellyeah sorry but newp.
[19:53:00] <hellyeah> newp?
[19:53:05] <hellyeah> what is newp?
[19:53:24] <robertmaxrees> *nope*
[19:58:08] <robertmaxrees> fa
[19:58:11] <robertmaxrees> woops.
[19:59:00] <taplar> font awesome *double taps chest*
[19:59:09] <robertmaxrees> haha
[20:02:12] <bjsnider> where should i go for html specs instead of w3c?
[20:03:19] <snover> eh?
[20:03:19] <taplar> mdn is a good resource
[20:03:44] <hellyeah> mdn is official
[20:04:01] <bjsnider> cool
[20:04:01] <snover> mdn is not a source of html specifications, it is a documentation site
[20:04:07] <bjsnider> w3c is the top google result
[20:04:18] <bjsnider> google can't possibly be wrong about stuff
[20:04:20] <hellyeah> forget about w3c
[20:04:38] <snover> w3c and whatwg handle html specifications
[20:05:23] <snover> ecma handles the javascript specification
[20:05:53] <hellyeah> bjoe2k4:  these are the sources you may need to check
[20:05:57] <hellyeah> http://developers.whatwg.org || Also: http://html5rocks.com http://diveintohtml5.info http://mzl.la/9giLwR
[20:06:17] <hellyeah> snover:  isnt that w3?
[20:06:20] <bjsnider> i guess you need to go 3 letters deep
[20:06:25] <hellyeah> sorry
[20:06:27] <hellyeah> w3c
[20:06:28] <hellyeah> yea
[20:06:40] <snover> isn’t what w3?
[20:06:54] <hellyeah> no i was just confused sorry
[20:07:13] <hellyeah> bjsnider:  freenode has a dedicated channel to html --> #html5
[20:07:42] <bjsnider> i'm sure
[20:08:16] <hellyeah> i need to sleep little bit more good night
[21:57:52] <acidjazz> ok
[21:57:55] <acidjazz> i got a question
[21:57:59] <acidjazz> for preference
[21:58:05] <acidjazz> say you have a list of divs w/ names
[21:58:14] <acidjazz> so products
[21:58:36] <acidjazz> and i need to target one of those products
[21:58:45] <acidjazz> do i name them a custom class like product_socks
[21:58:51] <acidjazz> give htem an id #product_socks
[21:59:15] <acidjazz> or give them a data-product="socks" and then loop through all of the products to find it?
[22:02:12] <snover> i don’t know. do you hate performance? if you hate performance, definitely loop through things.
[22:02:26] <acidjazz> i do not
[22:02:51] <acidjazz> and i do not assuming because its performance
[22:02:58] <acidjazz> just giving options
[22:03:03] <acidjazz> and trying to see how people like to do things
[22:03:55] <acidjazz> well heres one thing snover
[22:04:08] <acidjazz> if i create an id or a class w/ that given product name, i now have to replace spaces and other certain characters
[22:04:17] <acidjazz> limiting my unique value
[22:04:19] <snover> that’s not true
[22:04:28] <acidjazz> classes cant have spaces
[22:05:29] <snover> ids can. https://jsfiddle.net/y6w5mxvf/
[22:05:37] <acidjazz> do you want to just say what you do?
[22:05:40] <acidjazz> your preference?
[22:13:31] <gry> Hi all. :) A silly question about async and sync requests - in http://dpaste.com/00AMN98 how do I make the value from line 23 to be also defined on line 26?
[22:14:24] <acidjazz> gry; instead of returning that, have that function also accept a callback function
[22:14:33] <acidjazz> gry; _getTemplatesFromWikitext(wt, callback)
[22:14:51] <acidjazz> gry: then execute that callback once you have templateName, callback(templateName);
[22:15:05] <acidjazz> gry: then you use that function by passing the wt, and then a function
[22:15:41] <snover> gry: http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide40
[22:16:28] <acidjazz> snover: are you a bot?
[22:16:31] <snover> since _getTemplatesFromWikitext relies on an asynchronous operation, it should be returning a Promise, and consumers should connect to that promise.
[22:17:41] <gry> Thanks. Do we have an example of such usage? I end up nesting things too much when I try.
[22:23:14] <snover> producer: function _getTemplatesFromWikitext(wt) { return $.ajax(…).then(function (data) { var templateNames … return templateNames; }); }
[22:23:42] <snover> consumer: _getTemplatesFromWikitext('foo').then(function (templateNames) { DO WORK HERE });

[22:24:32] <Captain_Ramius> Anybody used this before?
[22:24:43] <acidjazz> i did a while back
[22:24:46] <acidjazz> blueimp ftw
[22:24:54] <acidjazz> i kinda just wrote my own though lately
[22:25:00] <acidjazz> the file api is so easy these days
[22:25:28] <Captain_Ramius> Haha. Easy is relative: I just started self-teaching web dev this spring.
[22:25:44] <snover> i’m so sorry.
[22:25:48] <Captain_Ramius> I need some help to add an option to the .fileupload() call
[22:26:07] <Captain_Ramius> snover, who died?
[22:26:32] <Captain_Ramius> sorry, you caught me off guard.
[22:27:07] <Captain_Ramius> I need to add an option so that it will rename my photos incrementally (X-1.jpg, X-2.jpg, etc.) before they upload.
[22:30:12] <Captain_Ramius> acidjazz, can this easily be done?
[22:31:40] <acidjazz> i believe so, you sure you dont want to tackle this on the back end?
[22:32:12] <Captain_Ramius> The filename will come from a form input value though.
[22:33:07] <Captain_Ramius> I think it would be easier to tell it the name in the JS than to pass the value and photos separately and try to hook them up down the line.
[22:33:32] <Captain_Ramius> I can get it to rename the files actually, just not hte incremental part.
[22:34:00] <Captain_Ramius> I keep getting "X (1).jpg", "X (2).jpg", etc. instead of X-1.jpg, X-2.jpg
[22:35:49] <gry> snover, sure, I "tried" that at https://test.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Gryllida/gadgets/toolbar/modules/rater/init.js but when I would like to log templateNames it logs wt instead
[22:36:23] <snover> because you are creating implicit global variables
[22:36:32] <snover> and are using .done, not .then
[22:36:34] <snover> this is not at all what i said to do
[22:37:22] <gry> dunno what variables are global or implicit or not, I don't have any knowledge on that. I'll try .then instead of .done and see whether it works
[22:37:55] <gry> .then helps, thanks snover :)
[22:38:55] <snover> read https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/var
[22:40:26] <gry> thanks snover, that's useful to know, I wasn't using it before
[23:06:08] <acidjazz> snover: btw even if you can put spaces in ids, you cant $('#do this');
[23:06:44] <acidjazz> snover: and technically even though it works, its invalid
[23:07:13] <acidjazz> snover: sure maybe $("[id='snover is a bot']")
[23:07:35] <acidjazz> snover: "ID tokens must begin with a letter ([A-Za-z]) and may be followed by any number of letters, digits ([0-9]), hyphens ("-"), underscores ("_"), colons (":"), and periods (".")."
[23:07:42] <snover> wrong
[23:07:57] <snover> you are reading from the html4 spec, there are no such restrictions in html5
[23:07:58] <snover> https://jsfiddle.net/Leqrjd9o/
[23:08:13] <acidjazz> who said anything about which spec
[23:08:40] <acidjazz> snover: also you never answered my question, whats your preference
[23:08:50] <snover> the least stupid option
[23:08:58] <acidjazz> i gave 3
[23:09:23] <acidjazz> try telling me your preference w/ less internalized anger
[23:29:31] <gry> Hi again, at https://test.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Gryllida/gadgets/toolbar/modules/rater/init.js&oldid=297377 the `paramString` is populated properly but not passed to the other function. Why?
