[04:52:34] <bestdesign1> hi all how can make a jquery function with smooth scroll? and call it later something like
[04:52:50] <bestdesign1> $('#idtoscroll').myscrollfunction(500);
[04:52:52] <bestdesign1> ?
[04:54:51] <Cork> bestdesign1: https://github.com/flesler/jquery.scrollTo
[05:16:47] <bestdesign1> Cork: thanks btw is not possible with own function?
[05:17:09] <Cork> bestdesign1: sure, but for "how" just read what the plugin does
[05:21:37] <bestdesign1> Cork: thx for info
[07:23:07] <robertparkerx> I'm not really sure if my value is an object or array but I'm trying to make it a query string value so I can $_REQUEST
[07:23:32] <robertparkerx> https://d.pr/i/rFCgh7
[07:24:08] <robertparkerx> when I try to print it now it says [Object Object]
[07:26:16] <Cork> don't ask ppl to debug an image...
[07:26:29] <Cork> you can't post javascript variables directly
[07:26:53] <Cork> [Object Object] means you have an instance of something that is called toString() on
[07:27:28] <Cork> you most likely want to either use key: value (object) and give it to $.post or $.ajax
[07:27:33] <Cork> and have it convert it to params
[07:27:46] <Cork> or use JSON.parse to make a json string of it
[07:28:10] <Cork> if you want help to figure out what that is; make a jsfiddle or similar
[07:28:15] <robertparkerx> jQuery.each to create it?
[07:28:28] <Cork> no
[10:45:21] <gonzolo> How do you get the text of a selected link to add it as an attribute? I'm trying to do the following but $(this).text() is always empty:  $("a[target='_blank']").attr('aria-label', $(this).text() + '; this is an external link that opens in new window');
[10:50:39] <shoky> gonzolo:  .attr('aria-label', function() { return $(this).text() + ...; })
[10:52:43] <shoky> what you were doing before is same as:  var tmp = $(this).text();   $("a[..]").attr('aria-label',  tmp + ...);     now you see why it's empty
[11:01:05] <gonzolo> shoky thanks, I'll try it
[11:07:37] <gonzolo> shoky worked perfectly, thank you so much!
[11:07:40] <gonzolo> shoky++
[14:51:47] <jak2000> i get this error: parsererror SyntaxError: Unexpected token % in JSON at position 0   and the json is: "0":"Ninguna","21":"PAQUETE","13":"ROLLOS 500","14":"ROLLOS 110","15":"ROLLOS PLU 5000","16":"ROLLOS PLU 10000","17":"JUEGO","18":"PAR","19":"SERVICIO ANUAL","20":"LIC","12":"ROLLOS 2000","11":"ROLLOS","10":"BLOCK","9":"CONTENEDOR","8":"TAMBO","7":"CAJA","1":"PIEZA","2":"BULTO","3":"KILOGRA
[14:51:48] <jak2000> MOS","4":"LITROS","5":"METROS","6":"PIES"   wich is wrong? thanks
[14:52:39] <taplar> alot is wrong there.  There are no {}
[14:54:51] <jak2000> taplar have (i not write more code) in my java return i have this:  json.put("xAClasificacion", "{" + wJson + "}");   where wJson = ""0":"Ninguna","21":"PAQUETE","13":"ROLLOS 500","14":"ROLLOS 110","15":"ROLLOS PLU 5000","16":"ROLLOS PLU 10000","17":"JUEGO","18":"PAR","19":"SERVICIO ANUAL","20":"LIC","12":"ROLLOS 2000","11":"ROLLOS","10":"BLOCK","9":"CONTENEDOR","8":"TAMBO","7":"CAJA","1":"P
[14:54:51] <jak2000> IEZA","2":"BULTO","3":"KILOGRAMOS","4":"LITROS","5":"METROS","6":"PIES"
[14:55:17] <taplar> where are you parsing the string?
[14:55:46] <jak2000> i do an ajax request and return the json
[14:55:53] <jak2000> create pastebin...
[14:56:28] <taplar> so you need to examine the string returned to ajax and verify that.
[14:56:55] <taplar> regardless of how it is constructed, what it actually is, is the indicator of if we need to look at the backend for the issue or not.
[15:01:06] <jak2000> not kwow... yesterday the code work... i restarted the server... erased cache, and i get the error...
[15:01:45] <taplar> F12, go to the network tab, then make the ajax request happen.  Once you do that, the request will show in your network list and you can click it, and look at the response on it
[15:09:36] <jak2000> taplar follow your advice and get this: xAUnidad: "{"0":"Ninguna","21":"PAQUETE","13":"ROLLOS 500","14":"ROLLOS 110","15":"ROLLOS PLU 5000","16":"ROLLOS PLU 10000","17":"JUEGO","18":"PAR","19":"SERVICIO ANUAL","20":"LIC","12":"ROLLOS 2000","11":"ROLLOS","10":"BLOCK","9":"CONTENEDOR","8":"TAMBO","7":"CAJA","1":"PIEZA","2":"BULTO","3":"KILOGRAMOS","4":"LITROS","5":"METROS","6":"PIES"}"
[15:16:28] <taplar> exactly that?
[15:17:10] <jak2000> yes
[15:17:19] <jak2000> with all "
[15:17:42] <taplar> then the first issue is that your string starts with "xAUnidad
[15:21:00] <jak2000> not start with "    need force to start with "   : "xAUnidad ?
[15:35:35] <taplar> json is expected to follow normal object or array pattern
[15:35:41] <taplar> { stuff } or [ stuff]
[16:31:20] <shoky> or "stuff" or <number> or null, etc :p
[16:31:38] <taplar> sure, :)
[16:31:52] <shoky> oh been an hour woops
[16:32:04] <taplar> still valid, ^_^
[18:37:30] <taplar> lol, snackoverflow, love it
[18:37:52] <snackoverflow> :)
[18:56:59] <robertparkerx> Can someone help me? I get TypeError is not a function -- var productRow = $(this).closest("tr").data('product').val();
[18:57:18] <robertparkerx> I'm trying to get the closest tr with data-product value
[18:58:15] <robertmaxrees> do you just want the value of .data('product')?
[18:58:34] <robertmaxrees> robertparkerx becuase if so, you don't need .val();
[18:58:44] <robertparkerx> Yes
[18:58:46] <robertparkerx> Oh
[18:59:02] <robertmaxrees> .data('product') is all you need.
[18:59:12] <robertparkerx> heh that was it
[18:59:18] <robertmaxrees> :)
[19:00:34] <robertparkerx> could I do this $(this).closest("tr").data('product').val(removeProduct);
[19:01:07] <robertparkerx> $(this).closest("tr").data('product').val(removeProduct).css('display','none'); sorry
[19:01:22] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[19:01:41] <robertmaxrees> are you trying to set data-product?
[19:02:16] <robertparkerx> no I'm trying to select the tr with data-product value 'removeProduct' and set it css to display:none;
[19:02:34] <robertmaxrees> .val() is only for inputs.
[19:02:41] <robertmaxrees> you want .filter()
[19:04:26] <robertmaxrees> but also: .closest() only selects the first element that matches, so you can't use that here.
[19:04:38] <robertmaxrees> can you make a fiddle with some example markup?
[19:08:31] <robertparkerx> https://jsfiddle.net/j2vgL8wc/
[19:08:43] <robertparkerx> this works
[19:09:39] <robertmaxrees> so closest selects the first element that matches the selector and stops
[19:46:20] <robertparkerx> Thank you robertmaxrees
[19:48:35] <znf> I have a rather weird question to ask, not sure how to frame it. I have a subdomain like portal.* where our clients handle all their billing and services, this runs a specific billing CMS. I have a front-end to this, www.* where we present our products & everything
[19:49:37] <znf> On the front-end, www.*, we embed a script from portal.*, like: https://portal.*/loginstatus.php, this does a document.write('') with a specific string (ie: Hello <name>)
[19:49:58] <znf> Obviously, document.write() is a horrible approach and I want to change that.
[19:51:14] <znf> I rewrote the server-side script so it returns a json object, and I'm fetching it with jquery. I have made sure to pass all the required CORS headers (I think?), yet, when I load it via jQuery, the script returns my data as I'm not being logged on
[19:51:57] <znf> When I embed the document.write script via <script src=""> it works
[19:53:23] <znf> When I look at the GET request in the developer console, I can see that the Request Header includes all the cookies for portal.*, but when I do the same with jQuery, there's no cookies being included from portal.*
[19:53:32] <znf> What gives?
[19:55:28] <znf> My code is relatively simple: https://jsfiddle.net/j4kxwao7/
[20:05:37] <znf> Guess I could generate the script server-side, and just source it like the document.write() one, but instead of document.write, just do container.append()
[20:56:44] <shoky> znf: what do you mean with "the script returns my data as I'm not being logged on" ?
[20:57:38] <znf> my server-side script has a conditional for if ( loggedin() ) { hi_user } else { hello_stranger }
[20:58:41] <shoky> as == as if?
[20:59:10] <znf> uhm, what?
[20:59:32] <shoky> trying to understand "as I'm not being logged on"
[20:59:53] <znf> not sure what you're not understanding from my explanation...
[21:00:27] <shoky> first of all, "the script returns my data"  sounds good?
[21:01:08] <znf> Let me rephrase - I have a ./loginstatus.php that returns "logged on" or "not logged on"; depending on the login status
[21:01:27] <znf> if I visit ./loginstatus.php in the browser, I get "logged on"
[21:01:43] <znf> if I .ajax() ./loginstatus.php I get "not logged on"
[21:02:19] <znf> if I <script src="https://portal.*/loginstatus.php"> I get "logged on"
[21:03:49] <shoky> znf you can try $.ajax({ url: "...", xhrFields: {withCredentials: true} })
[21:04:09] <znf> I did
[21:04:11] <shoky> cookies are not sent by default in cross-origin ajax
[21:04:18] <znf> didn't help sadly
[21:04:30] <shoky> you still didn't see the cookies in devtools
[21:04:31] <shoky> ?
[21:04:47] <shoky> and no CORS errors?
[21:05:12] <znf> nope, but that was an hour ago and I don't have the headers anymore
[21:05:20] <shoky> i think you'd also need  Access-Control-Allow-Credentials  header for this
[21:05:26] <znf> I do have it
[21:05:41] <znf> anyway, like I said earlier, I just output the actual script with the built-up element directly
[21:05:44] <znf> less headaches
[21:06:28] <shoky> hm oks
[21:56:02] <guy_frm_yogaland> hello people
[21:56:14] <guy_frm_yogaland> can any1 help me in fixing a small issue
[21:56:16] <guy_frm_yogaland> ?
[21:57:43] <znf> just ask away, if someone's free/online and they can, they'll try to
[21:59:42] <guy_frm_yogaland> ok
[22:01:02] <guy_frm_yogaland> i am using django framework for developing a web app and there for the form generation i am using a jquery form, when i use the form rendering then it doesn't load up a specific javascript local file
[22:01:14] <guy_frm_yogaland> how to fix that, do you ave any idea about that?
[22:05:40] <znf> I do not
[22:05:46] <znf> But your explanation is... lacking
[22:06:55] <guy_frm_yogaland> ok
[22:09:00] <guy_frm_yogaland> how can i explain, there is a local file called "jqueryform.com.min" and it needs to be given some arguments like ?****&**** (something like that) when i include in my django html file then it doesn't apply the functionality of toggle and showing calender views
[22:17:52] <znf> you don't pass arguments to files...
[22:18:34] <guy_frm_yogaland> if i don't then the animations and toggling doesn't work
[22:19:20] <guy_frm_yogaland> when i use the forms.html file without django it works fine, but when i use it inside my django project it doesn't work
[22:19:26] <guy_frm_yogaland> here is my html file:
[22:19:27] <guy_frm_yogaland> https://dpaste.de/TNgX
[22:20:57] <znf> maybe someone else can make sense of what you're saying, sadly I do not :)
[22:22:49] <guy_frm_yogaland> ok, thanks for the help
[22:22:52] <guy_frm_yogaland> see you
