[00:38:32] <frank_o> Anybody familiar with Parallax.js? I got these cats here which expand on hover: http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/5Jtf5/1/
[00:38:35] <frank_o> But is there a way to also make them appear in the foreground (depth 1.00) on hover?
[00:41:40] <Uhkis> frank_o: http://jsfiddle.net/5Jtf5/2/
[00:46:55] <frank_o> Uhkis: sweet thanks a lot :D
[00:50:30] <_lazarevsky> morning all
[00:50:52] <_lazarevsky> I need to handle user input in a datepicker
[00:50:58] <_lazarevsky> users are able to input the date manually
[00:51:02] <frank_o_> damnit, got dc'ed
[00:51:06] <frank_o_> Uhkis: hope you got my thanks :)
[00:52:16] <Uhkis> frank_o_: np
[00:52:29] <_lazarevsky> I want to be able to do the following: If a user enters a date 32/3/2014
[00:52:43] <_lazarevsky> I want ot be able to detect that and round it off at 31/3
[00:52:53] <_lazarevsky> event it is 24432123/March-2014
[00:53:07] <_lazarevsky> I want to go last-day-of-the-month-month-year
[00:53:36] <Uhkis> the horror of trying to correct user input
[00:54:03] <_lazarevsky> I know.. there are so many different ways they mess up my system
[00:54:05] <_lazarevsky> hah
[00:54:11] <_lazarevsky> the boss says it shud be very flexible
[00:54:19] <_lazarevsky> which leaves me shitload of work to do.. not too sure how to proceed
[00:54:23] <_lazarevsky> any input would be highly appreciated
[00:55:41] <Uhkis> gather all possible separators first
[00:56:24] <_lazarevsky> separators?
[00:56:28] <_lazarevsky> the allowed format is the following
[00:56:37] <_lazarevsky> mm/dd <- in which case the current year is assumed
[00:56:54] <Uhkis> and if user inputs mm.dd
[00:57:02] <_lazarevsky> then the date is invalid
[00:58:10] <Uhkis> so why isn't 1234/12/2014 invalid? ;)
[00:58:23] <Uhkis> or did you mean invalid as in has to be auto corrected
[01:01:28] <_lazarevsky> oh I see
[01:01:34] <_lazarevsky> separators as the characters between the dates?
[01:01:44] <Antaranian> _lazarevsky: to avoid checking for days count in that month (especially that February thing) just put cursor on the first day of the next month
[01:01:54] <Antaranian> then get back one day
[01:02:34] <_lazarevsky> Antaranian: omg you'
[01:02:39] <_lazarevsky> ...re a genius!
[01:02:45] <_lazarevsky> didnt think of that
[01:03:04] <_lazarevsky> now what happens if both the date and month are ridiculously big
[01:03:11] <_lazarevsky> what if the date is 123123/123123123/2014
[01:03:30] <Antaranian> well, if it's some sort of reservation system
[01:03:37] <_lazarevsky> ok in that case I will set the date to the current date
[01:03:54] <_lazarevsky> the users can view their history of peer feedback
[01:04:04] <_lazarevsky> they are presented with two datepickers
[01:04:06] <_lazarevsky> to and from
[01:04:21] <Antaranian> thing is that you can't be certain what user means by 125888 as month
[01:04:24] <_lazarevsky> the minimum allowed date is their starting day at the company
[01:04:33] <Uhkis> wouldn't it be easiest to just put some example date near the datepicker and hilight it on wrong input?
[01:04:34] <_lazarevsky> and the maximum allowed date is current date
[01:04:38] <Antaranian> maybe it's about ~6000 years from now ?
[01:05:04] <Cork> note that Date.parse will most likely puke at many of those dates
[01:05:15] <_lazarevsky> I am using momentjs
[01:05:24] <Cork> also what are you going to do about 2014-05-01 and 2014/05/28934 ?
[01:05:39] <_lazarevsky> the format must be month/day/year
[01:05:44] <_lazarevsky> umm
[01:05:49] <_lazarevsky> Cork: that's a valid question actually..
[01:06:06] <Cork> and 05/2895/2014
[01:06:10] <Cork> and so on
[01:06:22] <_lazarevsky> Cork: 05/2895/2014
[01:06:25] <Cork> being flexible with dates is hard actually
[01:06:31] <_lazarevsky> I get the first day of month 5 + 1
[01:06:34] <_lazarevsky> and subtract one
[01:06:36] <Cork> cause there is too many formats
[01:06:43] <_lazarevsky> if the date is less than 2895
[01:06:46] <Antaranian> 2014/2014/2014
[01:06:50] <Antaranian> what's what here ?
[01:06:51] <_lazarevsky> I set the date to the last date of month 5
[01:06:56] <Cork> _lazarevsky: i meant how do you know if the first or second id month
[01:07:09] <_lazarevsky> that's what I am expecting..
[01:07:10] <Uhkis> Antaranian: well year is 2014 :D
[01:07:13] <Cork> *second is
[01:07:21] <Antaranian> Uhkis: :D
[01:07:28] <Cork> _lazarevsky: but then your not flexible anymore
[01:07:44] <_lazarevsky> that's as far as my flexibility goes mate :)
[01:07:48] <_lazarevsky> month/date or month/date/year
[01:07:54] <Cork> being strict on the order but not that the numbers are even remotely valid is... strange
[01:08:45] <_lazarevsky> Cork: that may be your opinion of course.. now with that in mind, I would appreciate if you could advise me on how to handle those scenarios
[01:08:54] <Cork> as i user i would find it VERY strange if i added 2014/05/40 and got 2040-05-31
[01:09:22] <_lazarevsky> Cork: users will be notified of the format allowed you see
[01:09:36] <Cork> _lazarevsky: the only way i see it working is to be strict that the values are somewhat valid
[01:09:51] <Cork> ex month can't ever be more then 12
[01:10:00] <Uhkis> _lazarevsky: so what's the point of this conversion then?
[01:10:00] <_lazarevsky> well yeah!
[01:10:01] <Cork> days can't be more then 31
[01:10:11] <_lazarevsky> aha I see..
[01:10:12] <Cork> and years are always 4 digits
[01:10:22] <_lazarevsky> but one of the requirements is that if the user inputs 32/1
[01:10:27] <Cork> then you just have to guess on low numbers for day and month
[01:10:29] <_lazarevsky> I should round it all off to 31/1
[01:11:06] <Uhkis> well that's a weird date for mm.dd format :D
[01:11:17] <_lazarevsky> sorry
[01:11:19] <_lazarevsky> 1/32
[01:11:55] <Antaranian> _lazarevsky: well, if you're certain about the scenario for some reason, just start from month, make it 12 if needed, then make days valid
[01:11:56] <Cork> _lazarevsky: i would prob restrict entry in the field to valid values
[01:12:08] <Cork> so they just can't enter a month bigger then 12
[01:12:18] <Cork> and a day limited to the number of days that month
[01:12:40] <Cork> then you don't have to handle the bilions of strange combinations
[01:12:47] <Cork> and guesswork
[01:15:53] <_lazarevsky> Antaranian: Cork, you're right
[01:15:59] <_lazarevsky> Antaranian: Cork that's what I shall do
[01:16:09] <_lazarevsky> Antaranian: Cork Uhkis, thanks for yer feedback
[01:16:15] <_lazarevsky> appreciate it
[01:16:20] <Cork> _lazarevsky: good luck
[01:16:21] <Uhkis> np and good luck
[01:16:22] <Antaranian> good luck with it
[01:16:31] <Cork> it is a hard task your heading for :)
[01:17:08] <_lazarevsky> can you recommend an easy to plug validation framework?
[01:17:24] <_lazarevsky> where I dont have to include a billion files
[01:17:35] <Cork> jquery-validator
[01:17:39] <_lazarevsky> remember I am not working with a form, everything is async
[01:19:11] <_lazarevsky> jquery validator wont work because I am not working with forms :)
[01:20:47] <Antaranian> _lazarevsky: what's your input ?
[01:21:00] <_lazarevsky> input text
[01:21:50] <Cork> _lazarevsky: you should always have a form around your input system
[01:22:04] <Cork> even if your not sending it through normal http post
[01:22:04] <Antaranian> like, it's `<input ..` or some sort of promt or you're parsing it from email/etc. ?
[01:22:26] <_lazarevsky> it's a single page application
[01:22:32] <_lazarevsky> I'm using Ember as the front-end framework
[01:22:38] <_lazarevsky> I am sending ajax calls to the api
[01:23:58] <_lazarevsky> so I am not using forms
[01:24:17] <Antaranian> _lazarevsky: http://stackoverflow.com/a/6178341/151686
[01:24:28] <Antaranian> maybe it can help
[01:24:53] <Antaranian> by the way, it's ok to wrap inputs in form, as Cork said.
[01:35:25] <_lazarevsky> hey guys
[01:35:28] <_lazarevsky> I just thought of something
[01:35:38] <_lazarevsky> I still can be flexible with regards to dates though
[01:35:50] <_lazarevsky> lets say the input is 1/32
[01:35:53] <_lazarevsky> then I check the month
[01:36:07] <_lazarevsky> if the month is valid then I get the last day of that month
[01:36:20] <_lazarevsky> if the month is invalid I give them the error message
[01:36:32] <Antaranian> _lazarevsky: the problem is that sometimes you don't know what that means at all
[01:36:49] <_lazarevsky> I dont understand
[01:36:59] <Antaranian> for you 1/32 ~ 1/31, for me 1/32 ~ 2/1
[01:37:18] <_lazarevsky> I was told to round it off at the last day of the month
[01:37:25] <Antaranian> you can't guess what's in user's mind
[01:37:26] <_lazarevsky> they prolly made a mistake when they typed 32
[01:37:41] <Antaranian> well, maybe they just increment
[01:38:02] <Antaranian> like 24, then 25, then.. , then 32
[01:39:54] <Antaranian> if it's about being more "absurd", you can make your script learn from the users' mistakes
[01:40:07] <Antaranian> they often increment or make typos
[01:40:28] <Antaranian> and adapt to it.. but it's a different field of study
[01:40:38] <Antaranian> I'd never do that for a regular project
[02:34:47] <MagePsycho> Hi
[02:39:51] <dopie> anyone here have experience with modal and rails?
[02:56:06] <dopie> hey
[02:56:16] <dopie> I nee dhelp with modals can anyone help m
[02:56:18] <dopie> e
[02:57:11] <brunoais> dopie, what is your question?
[02:58:01] <dopie> brunoais, are you brazilian/
[02:59:35] <brunoais> dopie, no but I speak portuguese
[02:59:40] <dopie> Oh :)
[02:59:49] <dopie> with a nick like Bruno i was suspect
[02:59:50] <dopie> :)
[03:05:20] <skullcrasher> if I load html with embeded js with an ajax call, how can I fire that js?
[03:05:49] <skullcrasher> is there a way to "fake" the document load event, so it fires all scripts automatically?
[03:06:56] <brunoais> dopie, do you still need help?
[03:07:05] <dopie> nah
[03:07:06] <dopie> i got it
[03:07:10] <brunoais> ok
[03:07:10] <dopie> but thank you
[03:07:13] <dopie> :P
[03:07:17] <dopie> it was pretty simple
[03:07:26] <brunoais> skullcrasher, probably you are doing wrong from the start by sending js to the client like that
[03:08:18] <skullcrasher> the thing is i render a file in php an return the html (where also the js is in)
[03:08:39] <skullcrasher> the partial render html is then put into a modal body
[03:09:50] <skullcrasher> all via jquery ajax
[03:10:57] <skullcrasher> as the modal body content differs and also needsd different other js, I load this in the rendered specific php file
[03:11:12] <skullcrasher> but after jquery inserted the html with js the js is not loaded :/
[03:11:36] <skullcrasher> and of course document ready was already triggered
[03:11:42] <ryorky1> can someone help me figure out why I am getting a No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource. Origin 'null' is therefore not allowed access.  error.  here is my fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/5dBYa/
[03:11:45] <brunoais> skullcrasher, do you need the modal as soon as the page loads?
[03:12:20] <brunoais> ryorky1, do you control the server where you are doing the AJAX request?
[03:12:54] <skullcrasher> no
[03:13:02] <skullcrasher> it is triggered
[03:13:09] <brunoais> skullcrasher, how frequently is that modal used?
[03:13:25] <skullcrasher> often, as it provides input
[03:13:27] <ryorky1> brunoais:  right now, yes, but I will eventually be putting it on google sites
[03:14:21] <brunoais> ryorky1, IIRC by the way jQuery works, there's an option somewhere to prepare it for using with CORS. Seems like you are not using it. I don't remmeber its name
[03:14:35] <brunoais> skullcrasher, then download with the rest of the page content
[03:14:45] <brunoais> don't wait so long
[03:15:38] <brunoais> Keep it simple, buddy ;)
[03:48:04] <Voyage> http://www.appannie.com/apps/ios/top-table/20140505-US-36-iphone/?p=2-&h=2&iap=undefined       shows "ajax call onlly"  on a direct hit. so theres no way to get data from it directly?
[03:54:17] <hxm> i have a function in this: jQuery(function($) { function functionName() {}
[03:54:23] <hxm> and when I call to functionName it says doesnt exists
[03:57:28] <hxm> why please o why
[04:00:57] <Cork> hxm: most likely cause your calling the function from something like onclick="functionName()"
[04:01:08] <hxm> yes I did
[04:01:20] <hxm> oh, hm
[04:01:24] <Cork> the function doesn't exist in the global scope
[04:01:30] <Cork> so you can't call it from global scope :)
[04:01:44] <Cork> user event listeners instead of event attributes and things should just work
[04:01:54] <hxm> ah.. right
[04:04:04] <hxm> hm I have a grid with items and I want to detect when a <a href> of each item has been clicked
[04:04:12] <hxm> do I need create a event listener per item?
[04:04:20] <dopie> actually i do need help
[04:04:21] <dopie> http://gwhite.staycreativedesign.com/users/sign_up
[04:04:28] <Cork> $('table').on('click', 'a', func)
[04:04:28] <dopie> why isnt my modal workign@!?#?@!#@!
[04:04:36] <Cork> hxm: ^
[04:04:44] <hxm> so nice, thanks
[04:05:56] <Cork> dopie: side note, you can't wrap p in p
[04:06:48] <Cork> for the rest... your js is minimized...
[04:07:25] <dopie> ok
[04:07:26] <dopie> ?
[04:07:43] <dopie> so i need minimized modal.js?
[04:07:46] <Cork> so it isn't exactly optimized for debugging your code
[04:09:20] <dopie> oh
[04:29:14] <melkor> what is a good way to capture a finished editing on a text input element? I'm thinking focus, but I'm not positive.
[04:31:04] <Cork> melkor: sounds like change is what you want
[04:33:08] <seutje> what's that ajax image again? illustrating the common issues with async calls?
[04:33:12] <seutje> `ajax101
[04:33:12] <b-ot> seutje: Please reference the AJAX 101 diagram: http://oi41.tinypic.com/etsbyo.jpg and these slides: http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide41
[04:33:16] <seutje> lol nvm
[04:37:55] <Colonel_Panic> Hey I'm trying to sort a JSON object and display it in a table
[04:38:07] <Colonel_Panic> can anybody offer any help with this?
[04:38:35] <seutje> JavaScript objects are unordered by definition
[04:40:10] <Colonel_Panic> I'm using JQuery to get a JSON object and display it in a table. I want to be able to sort the contents of the columns in that table by clicking on a header cell
[04:40:31] <Cork> Colonel_Panic: you're mixing up definitions a bit
[04:40:38] <Cork> i suspect your getting a json string
[04:40:46] <Cork> and the string is most likely an array of objects
[04:40:50] <Colonel_Panic> yes
[04:40:52] <Colonel_Panic> Sorry
[04:40:53] <Cork> json isn't an object
[04:41:07] <Colonel_Panic> It's an array of objects, OK
[04:41:08] <Colonel_Panic> ?
[04:41:09] <Cork> Colonel_Panic: have a look at Array.sort
[04:41:18] <Colonel_Panic> yeah, I have
[04:41:20] <Cork> ?mdn array.sort
[04:41:21] <b-ot> Cork: Array.prototype.sort() - JavaScript | MDN - Mozilla Developer Network → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/sort
[04:41:23] <Springlab> Is there a way to possibly delay an ajax call before it returns the data from the server?
[04:41:42] <Cork> Springlab: sure puts a sleep or similar server side
[04:41:59] <Colonel_Panic> I'm trying to implement that functionality, but something is going wrong
[04:42:14] <Cork> Colonel_Panic: then show the code you have
[04:42:16] <Colonel_Panic> I have the JSON array displaying in a table just fine
[04:42:21] <Colonel_Panic> OK just a sec
[04:42:22] <brunoais> Springlab, you better thing on the "why" you need that
[04:42:37] <brunoais> you may be going towards a maintenance hellp
[04:42:40] <brunoais> *hell
[04:51:49] <Springlab> brunoais: I need the to allow the ajax call time to load the page on the server before it returns it
[04:52:39] <brunoais> What do you mean by "load the page on the server"?
[04:52:52] <brunoais> AJAX call time?
[04:52:53] <Springlab> Oh wait...I forgot Ajax calls don't load anything outside the body.
[04:53:11] <Springlab> I'm trying to scrape content from a clients website for a touchscreen application.
[04:53:15] <brunoais> Springlab, ?!?1
[04:53:26] <Springlab> Iframes are slow as hell unfrotunately.
[04:53:36] <Springlab> unfortunately*
[04:54:00] <brunoais> Springlab, AJAX is slower than an iframe
[04:54:40] <Springlab> Running multiple iframes, pulling content from multiple pages of the website is slowing down the application.
[04:55:56] <Colonel_Panic> OK, here's what I have so far http://jsfiddle.net/VgCZL/
[04:56:53] <brunoais> Springlab, maybe you are doing it wrong for doing the pulling in the page itself with AJAX
[04:57:07] <brunoais> that depends on what the application is for and how it is supposed to work, though
[04:57:36] <brunoais> but delays like those are as general case a really bad idea
[04:59:11] <Colonel_Panic> What I need to do is load the JSON string into an array, then listen for a click on any column header in the table, sort the rows of data by that column, then re-draw the table with the newly reordered data
[04:59:20] <Springlab> brunoais: I'm not pulling the content with Ajax yet. Was only considering it.
[05:00:18] <brunoais> Springlab, Hum... try pulling server-side, joining together and then outputing to the browser
[05:00:41] <brunoais> don't forget to use caching mechanisms
[05:01:39] <Colonel_Panic> Am I going about this the wrong way, or what?
[05:03:27] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, I didn't see the code but the logic seems correct
[05:03:39] <Colonel_Panic> http://jsfiddle.net/VgCZL/
[05:03:45] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, checking...
[05:04:32] <Colonel_Panic> I tried adding an onclick handler to the th cells
[05:04:52] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, are you sure oyu need to do the sorting server-side?
[05:04:56] <Colonel_Panic> invoking the function sortTable(column)
[05:05:11] <Colonel_Panic> No, I'm trying not to
[05:05:28] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, Ah... In that case. kill the ajax call
[05:05:42] <brunoais> make the table using HTML
[05:05:44] <brunoais> then call me
[05:05:47] <brunoais> I'll assist you
[05:06:02] <Colonel_Panic> that's just for JSfiddle
[05:06:14] <brunoais> I know
[05:06:17] <brunoais> just do it ;)
[05:06:20] <Colonel_Panic> The sorting is supposed to be done in the browser
[05:06:26] <Colonel_Panic> but I can't get it to work right
[05:06:50] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, for starters, kill the ajax call and related and give me the new link
[05:06:58] <brunoais> I can help you
[05:07:09] <seutje> lol, sry, I was gonna follow up on that sorting comment, but got distracted by evil project managers
[05:07:12] <Colonel_Panic> There is no actual ajax call
[05:07:44] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, delete the code pls :)
[05:07:51] <Colonel_Panic> Part of the requirement is to get the data from a JSON object
[05:07:58] <Colonel_Panic> then load it into a table
[05:08:01] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic,  O_O?
[05:08:07] <Colonel_Panic> and make the table sortable
[05:08:13] <brunoais> Someone here is nuts
[05:08:16] <seutje> https://datatables.net/ might be interesting to look at
[05:08:30] <brunoais> and that one is not you
[05:08:39] <Colonel_Panic> I know about datatablesm but I'm supposed to do this from scratch
[05:08:55] <seutje> oh, ok. well u can probably get some inspiration there
[05:09:00] <Colonel_Panic> part of the spec is no 3rd party libraries besides JQuery
[05:09:05] <seutje> heh
[05:09:24] <seutje> too bad it isn't MIT license :P
[05:09:36] <seutje> oh wait it is
[05:09:42] <Colonel_Panic> Look at my commented-out code at the bottom
[05:09:57] <Colonel_Panic> Oh sh*t
[05:09:59] <Colonel_Panic> sorry
[05:10:08] <seutje> not looking at the same thing, I think
[05:10:09] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, do you want me to help or not, hum? :)
[05:10:12] <Colonel_Panic> I didn't include that in this fiddle
[05:10:23] <Colonel_Panic> I don't understand what you want me to do
[05:10:48] <Colonel_Panic> the table must be dynamically generated from data provided in a JSON string
[05:10:56] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, Ah ok. Do this: remove all the javascript you have there
[05:11:04] <brunoais> Oh
[05:11:21] * brunoais checking JSON...
[05:11:35] <Colonel_Panic> DO you see what's going on in the first three functions?
[05:12:22] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, yeah. you have weird stuff there
[05:12:47] <brunoais> Let's go with basics, for starters
[05:13:14] <Colonel_Panic> I'm grabbing the JSON data, defining a function that iteratively draws columns including that data, then another function to assemble those rows into a table
[05:13:44] <Colonel_Panic> it's not really that weird, just basic parsing a JSON string and building a table out of it
[05:14:00] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, Ok
[05:14:10] <Colonel_Panic> What I need to do is, when somebody clicks a table header
[05:14:15] <brunoais> the building of the table is part of what I'm not so cool about
[05:14:24] <brunoais> well
[05:14:27] <brunoais> just some details
[05:14:32] <Colonel_Panic> it needs to re-grab (or otherwise reuse) that data array
[05:14:39] <brunoais> please don't
[05:14:48] <brunoais> general bad idea
[05:14:53] <Colonel_Panic> what is?
[05:15:01] <brunoais> regrabbing the JSON
[05:15:15] <brunoais> you used the JSON, then just throw it away
[05:15:30] <Colonel_Panic> OK then the JSON would need to be loaded into an array from the get-go?
[05:15:36] <brunoais> reorder using what you have in front of you
[05:15:40] <Colonel_Panic> right
[05:15:41] <Colonel_Panic> OK
[05:15:48] <brunoais> for startes
[05:15:53] <brunoais> *starters
[05:16:20] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, the last 2 lines of drawRow.
[05:16:24] <brunoais> do you know what they do?
[05:16:43] <Colonel_Panic> yeah those apply the classes to stripe the tables
[05:17:04] <Colonel_Panic> Purely cosmetic
[05:17:10] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, I mean, what they REALLY do
[05:17:23] <brunoais> you don't need them unless you need to support old outdated browsers
[05:18:02] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, do you know what they do?
[05:18:35] <Colonel_Panic> yes, the first one looks for even table rows, then applies a css class to them, then the second line looks for odd table rows and applies a different class to those
[05:18:38] <brunoais> I don't mean the super high level BS ;). I mean the actual thing on the DOM
[05:18:39] <Colonel_Panic> why do you ask?
[05:18:53] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, why are you doing that for every single row that you place?
[05:18:53] <Colonel_Panic> that
[05:19:08] <brunoais> why not do it when it is complete?
[05:19:27] <Colonel_Panic> Once I get this thing working, I'll restrict it to just the #dataTable object
[05:19:33] <brunoais> not that
[05:19:39] <Colonel_Panic> but right now I have bigger fish to fry
[05:19:48] <brunoais> sigh...
[05:20:22] <brunoais> Ok
[05:20:25] <brunoais> moving one, then
[05:20:27] <brunoais> *on
[05:20:33] <Colonel_Panic> Here, if it makes you happer: http://jsfiddle.net/VgCZL/1/
[05:20:39] <Colonel_Panic> *happier*
[05:21:48] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, it makes me sadder that you didn't understand
[05:22:09] <Colonel_Panic> Um, ok well then why don't you explain what the issue is
[05:22:10] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, sounds like you don't know what you are doing
[05:22:25] <Colonel_Panic> it's obviously something I'm overlooking
[05:22:43] <Colonel_Panic> OK then...
[05:22:47] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, for each row you are placing you are loking at the WHOLE table and placing the even and odd classes
[05:22:56] <brunoais> do you understand that :)?
[05:23:06] <Colonel_Panic> Maybe it might help to explain where you;re coming from, instead of just being condescending
[05:23:34] <Colonel_Panic> OK, what would be the correct way to do it?
[05:23:48] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, you only need to apply that when you have the whole table. No need to do that every single time a new row is made
[05:24:10] <brunoais> besides, those things are awfully slow compared to the rest of the code
[05:24:23] <Colonel_Panic> OK, try doing that and see what happens
[05:24:50] <MikeD_> https://api.jquery.com/trigger/  <- should "eventType" language also include ".. a JavaScript (or custom event) type.. "  ?
[05:25:32] <Colonel_Panic> Try taking those out of the table-building function
[05:25:46] <Colonel_Panic> They won't work
[05:26:17] <Colonel_Panic> It might be a better idea to use a conditional to style each row according to its parity
[05:26:29] <Colonel_Panic> as the table is assembled
[05:27:18] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, http://jsfiddle.net/brunoais/VgCZL/4/
[05:27:39] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, I don't believe that it does not work with only CSS and without that code
[05:28:49] <MikeD_> is there a reason you are using .odd-row for a classname rather than an nth-child selector?
[05:29:14] <brunoais> MikeD_, I'm doing that because I dunno which browsers he needs to support
[05:29:24] <MikeD_> k, just checking
[05:29:30] <brunoais> if he needs ot support IE8 then there's no alternative
[05:29:46] <brunoais> ;)
[05:29:50] <MikeD_> IE: the browser slow kid
[05:29:56] <brunoais> :)
[05:30:14] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, did that make sense, what I did?
[05:30:47] <MikeD_> in the drawRow function, is there a preference for appending the row to the table before you add the td?
[05:30:54] <bberry> is doing $("#foo").find(".bar") the same thing as doing $("#foo .bar")?
[05:31:06] <Colonel_Panic> Yeah, totally
[05:31:10] <Colonel_Panic> Thanks for that
[05:31:31] <MikeD_> bberry: same end result, but difference processes
[05:31:47] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, ok, moving on
[05:32:05] <bberry> MikeD_ in what scenarios would you use .find? :/
[05:32:32] <brunoais> bberry, Perosnally, the exacly way you didn, I'd never use
[05:32:39] <Colonel_Panic> MikeD_ I don't have a preference, so long as the thing works
[05:32:55] <MikeD_> bberry: mostly when I already have a reference to the object that is #foo... i wouldn't want to rebuild the css just to .find() a child of it.
[05:33:07] <brunoais> the actual .find(), it's good when you want to search only inside a small subset o fthe page without having to repeat
[05:33:29] <brunoais> bberry, also what mike said
[05:33:41] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, in order to know when to sort, we need to place a click event listening to the th's
[05:34:00] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, do you know how to do that?
[05:34:01] <Colonel_Panic> yes
[05:34:07] <bberry> MikeD_, brunoais: makes sense. thanks :D
[05:34:23] <brunoais> bberry, look at the code I gave to Colonel_Panic
[05:34:29] <Colonel_Panic> Something like
[05:34:36] <brunoais> there's a an alias of the .find() there
[05:34:37] <Colonel_Panic> onclick="sortTable(column)"
[05:34:53] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, NEVER!
[05:35:08] <Colonel_Panic> "column" being the id of the column clicked
[05:35:22] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, NEVER EVER EVERR use on* attributes
[05:35:33] <brunoais> they are hell in maintenance
[05:35:39] <Colonel_Panic> you mean embedded JavaScript
[05:35:52] <bberry> brunoais looking at it... what am i lookin for
[05:35:54] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, hum?
[05:36:19] <Colonel_Panic> So I should put the event listener in the .js document instead of in the markup?
[05:36:39] <brunoais> bberry, "$("tr:even", $table)", for example
[05:36:39] <MikeD_> .on() is so much easier to use, why would anyone clutter markup with inline javascript
[05:36:51] <brunoais> mikecmpbll, Shhhh
[05:36:53] <bberry> brunoais ah gotcha
[05:37:01] <mikecmpbll> :/
[05:37:05] <brunoais> MikeD_, shhhh. He has to learn himself
[05:37:06] <mikecmpbll> no u
[05:37:20] <MikeD_> heh
[05:37:25] <brunoais> sorry mikecmpbll . Wrong mike
[05:37:29] <mikecmpbll> :D
[05:38:00] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, have you ever worked with the DOM itself?
[05:38:09] <MikeD_> DOM who?
[05:38:16] <Colonel_Panic> yes
[05:38:58] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, Hum... Do you understand the idiology behind it?
[05:39:03] <Colonel_Panic> You're suggesting I traverse the table to get the elements for the event handlers
[05:39:10] <cannap> HI any know this error http://cl.ly/image/1l050z060o2b ?
[05:39:13] <cannap> i cant resolve
[05:39:15] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, yeah... kinda.
[05:39:29] <brunoais> as there aren't many coluns, ytou may just place the event listeners in all th's
[05:39:35] <cannap> jquery 1.10.2 i downgraded  from 1.11.0
[05:39:35] <Colonel_Panic> well I've already classified the columns
[05:39:47] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, what do you mean?
[05:40:12] <Colonel_Panic> I could getElementByClass
[05:40:20] <Colonel_Panic> or.. the JQuery equivalent
[05:40:45] <brunoais> cannap, the easing plugin is running before jQuery has finished "booting"
[05:41:00] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, -_- that's not what you want
[05:41:15] <brunoais> you don't need those things
[05:41:19] <brunoais> make re-usable code
[05:41:38] <brunoais> make a code that you can use later to re-sort any table you do that follows +- the same rules tas that one
[05:42:17] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, ok, back to what cares.
[05:42:25] <brunoais> you need the event on all th, right?
[05:42:31] <brunoais> *event listener
[05:42:34] <MikeD_> if it takes you twice as long to write reusable code, you only need to use it one more time to break-even on investment and save yourself the rest of time in the future
[05:43:06] <Colonel_Panic> OK so if I want to make a click anywhere in any column, to be an event handler to sort the table byt that column...
[05:43:10] <brunoais> MikeD_, meh. I can do that in a re-usable way with just 1.2x the original time
[05:43:11] <brunoais> :D
[05:43:24] <brunoais> columnonly the th!
[05:43:34] <cannap> brunoais i added this now http://cl.ly/image/3v2i1K0K0c3L
[05:43:35] <cannap> but not working
[05:43:37] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, only the th!
[05:43:38] <MikeD_> brunoais: right, you've been doing it for a while... give a guy the benefit of some extra think-time :)
[05:43:55] <brunoais> MikeD_, ah ok... sure :)
[05:44:23] <MikeD_> the real trick is keeping the "just get it done" boss off your back so you _can_ do it right the first time.
[05:44:39] <Colonel_Panic> OK, so suppose I use nth-child
[05:44:53] <brunoais> I was able to make a table sorting code that beat a jQuery sort plugin by a full 30s for a table with 1000 records :D
[05:44:57] * brunoais proudness
[05:44:57] <Colonel_Panic> of any TR element
[05:45:10] <cannap> sometime is working but the eror is still here then is not working and more errors from the same function comes..
[05:45:20] <cannap> this is so a bullshit this f**** overloaded wp themes
[05:45:22] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, no
[05:45:33] <brunoais> th, not td
[05:45:42] <Colonel_Panic> OK then, the th
[05:45:42] <brunoais> just the first line
[05:45:45] <Colonel_Panic> right
[05:45:51] <Colonel_Panic> the table headers
[05:46:27] <brunoais> I'd even use the <thead> and <tbody> tage to make it more explicit
[05:46:30] <brunoais> *tags
[05:46:38] <MikeD_> brunoais: do you make any distinction about th that occur in rows other than the first?  or do you just not use th that way
[05:46:52] <Colonel_Panic> Will that work in a dynamically-generated table like this?
[05:46:54] <MikeD_> yeah
[05:46:56] <brunoais> MikeD_, I use th for headers and sub-headers
[05:47:16] <brunoais> MikeD_, for the actual table header, I place the tags inside <thead>
[05:47:27] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, ofc
[05:47:40] <brunoais> easy
[05:48:06] <cannap> ha i fixed with (function($) {
[05:48:07] <MikeD_> it's nice to see people caring about semantic markup
[05:48:44] <brunoais> MikeD_, I always care and I %#$%&"$%#$ with some stuff when I'm nearly !"$#%" for not being able to make like that
[05:48:48] <brunoais> like with primefaces
[05:49:51] <brunoais> that thing is nearly driving me nuts with the sheer amount of custom components I have to do to keep the page semantically ok and to make the HTML actually come at page load
[05:50:16] <brunoais> I'd rather use jsp but noo....
[05:50:33] <brunoais> I have to use a framework -_-
[05:50:46] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, what do you have now?
[05:51:31] <Colonel_Panic> I'm working on it
[05:51:40] <brunoais> ok
[05:51:44] <brunoais> call me when done.
[05:52:41] <brunoais> MikeD_, actually. it is correct HTML not writting <tbody> but it's not as easily manageable
[05:54:05] <Hyperking> how would you get the nodeValue from an array of objects?
[05:55:30] <MikeD_> understood.  I mean using <thead> to identify the tr/th that are actually column headers so tbody th can be row headers is a good discipline
[05:56:38] <brunoais> Hyperking, DOM or jQuery?
[05:57:16] <Hyperking> jquery
[05:57:17] <cannap> .c (function($)
[05:57:17] <b-ot> cannap: Sorry, I can't find anything on (function($)
[05:57:38] <Hyperking> brunoais:jquery
[05:57:40] <brunoais> .c $
[05:57:40] <b-ot> brunoais: Sorry, I can't find anything on $
[05:57:51] <cannap> pure js is think :P
[05:58:00] <brunoais> Hyperking, .text()
[05:58:14] <brunoais> is that what you meant?
[05:58:19] <brunoais> .c text
[05:58:19] <b-ot> brunoais: Sorry, I can't find anything on text
[05:58:20] <cannap> it solved my problem but i dont know why =)
[06:01:13] <Hyperking> brunoais: the data is stored inside an attribute named 'datedata'
[06:02:42] <brunoais> Hyperking, is it: "data-datedata"?
[06:02:56] <Hyperking> yes
[06:03:10] <brunoais> Hyperking, look for data() in the jQuery manual
[06:04:00] <Hyperking> i have, its a bit confusing to me
[06:04:09] <Hyperking> will try again
[06:04:50] <brunoais> Hyperking, you are nto alone. I prefer to use getAttribute() and setAttribute() :)
[06:05:00] <Katharsis> can I use :contains with ^ and $?
[06:05:51] <brunoais> I nearly vomit those custom jQuery pseudo-selectors...
[06:06:07] <Katharsis> or a[@text^=sth] but I dont know to close regexp with &?
[06:06:56] <brunoais> Katharsis, regexp?
[06:07:02] <brunoais> that's not regex :)
[06:07:08] <Katharsis> I know, but it looks like ;)
[06:07:11] <brunoais> It's just borrowed syntax
[06:07:14] <Katharsis> yeap
[06:07:22] <brunoais> what do you need, then?
[06:07:48] <Katharsis> a[@text^=5] is finding 5 and 50 and 500 and others
[06:07:51] <Katharsis> i need only "5"
[06:08:01] <Katharsis> so i has to start with 5 and end on it
[06:08:43] <brunoais> "a[@text=5]"?
[06:09:03] <Katharsis> yaep
[06:09:04] <Katharsis> ;]

[06:24:13] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, let me look at what you have now. I can try giving you more detailed help
[06:24:17] <Colonel_Panic> I'm trying to set up a simple event handler on the TR elements

[06:26:39] <Colonel_Panic> TH sorry
[06:26:50] <Colonel_Panic> It won't work on either, really
[06:29:13] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, it is working for me

[06:35:20] <Colonel_Panic> Yeah

[06:35:37] <Colonel_Panic> unless there's something wrong here
[06:36:01] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, I cannot reproduce not working

[06:36:24] <Colonel_Panic> weird
[06:37:03] <seutje> Colonel_Panic: http://jsfiddle.net/VgCZL/17/
[06:37:15] <seutje> sorting handler is a bit off though
[06:37:50] <seutje> also, it doesn't care about number atm :D
[06:37:52] <brunoais> seutje, don't just bluntly give the answer!
[06:38:06] <brunoais> that way he'll never learn!
[06:38:50] <Colonel_Panic> could be a browser setting
[06:39:02] <brunoais> seutje, besides, with your option, if it gets to as simple as 400 elements, the browser will bork
[06:39:19] <seutje> guess it isn't bluntly the answer after all
[06:39:39] <seutje> the answer was given over 2 hours ago though
[06:39:40] <Colonel_Panic> Yeah, those examples are working in FF for me, but noe Chrome
[06:39:52] <seutje> Colonel_Panic: try in an incognito window
[06:39:55] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, what's the error in the console?
[06:39:57] <Colonel_Panic> OK
[06:40:04] <Colonel_Panic> No error

[06:48:09] <Colonel_Panic> seutje: your solution is working in Chrome, but not in Firefox!
[06:48:28] <Colonel_Panic> FF 28.0
[06:48:33] <seutje> weird, it's not even suppose to work entirely in chrome
[06:48:59] <seutje> was only meant to give you an idea, rly
[06:49:29] <Colonel_Panic> Ooops
[06:49:39] <Colonel_Panic> Sorry, I got it working in FF
[06:50:05] <Colonel_Panic> Thanks though I appreciate it
[06:51:07] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, do you want to continue my way or are you done :)?
[06:51:32] <Colonel_Panic> Yes, I would like to continue
[06:52:08] <MikeD_> anyone here ever heard of "mPage" ?
[06:52:09] <Colonel_Panic> for some reason, seutje's solution won't work on my local machine with the JSON being read from a file
[06:52:27] <seutje> running it from file:// ?
[06:52:47] <Colonel_Panic> yeah, a .json file
[06:53:37] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, that's not allowed for security reasons
[06:53:52] <seutje> Colonel_Panic: yeah, that's considered a security violation
[06:54:15] <Atom_> #join /java
[06:54:19] <seutje> this is the main reason every project comes with a node static server nowadays :P
[06:54:36] <lericson_> you can use jsonp though :p
[06:54:57] <lericson_> a crappy form of it
[06:55:16] <Colonel_Panic> ah I see
[06:55:20] <Colonel_Panic> it makes sense
[06:56:26] <brunoais> <seutje> "this is the main reason every project comes with a node static server nowadays :P" What does that mean?
[06:56:52] <seutje> oh, there's tons of projects that are just static HTML + JS
[06:57:14] <seutje> but they come with a node.js static fileserver so it can be served off http://localhost:8000/ instead of file://path/to/shizzle
[06:58:11] <Bheam> yo
[06:58:37] <Bheam> is there any way to add a function to a specific jquery object (whenever it's $()'ed)
[06:58:55] <brunoais> Bheam, that depends on what you want
[06:59:12] <Bheam> i have $('slideshow') and i want to .pause() it
[06:59:34] <Bheam> i know i can extend jquery with a pause function, but was thinking it's better if it only applies to this object
[06:59:44] <brunoais> $.fn.slideShowPause = function (){}
[06:59:57] <erming> var slideshow = $("#slideshow"); slideshow.pause = function() { };
[07:00:05] <erming> will append "pause()" to just that object
[07:00:25] <brunoais> erming, I think that's not what he wanted... If it is, then it is also my 1st idea
[07:00:37] <Bheam> erming: will $('#slideshow').pause() work after that, or is it temporary on that instance?
[07:00:49] <erming> but you'll have to do it after you've fetched $("#slideshow"), all the time.. i'd say brunoais solution is better though
[07:01:08] <Bheam> so it's only that specific instance that is affected
[07:01:41] <Bheam> so i just make a generic function and make sure i'm on a slideshow object before proceeding
[07:01:42] <MikeD_> i wonder if a DOM node should have a .pause() method
[07:02:11] <Colonel_Panic> Here: http://www.sendspace.com/file/eakzht
[07:02:11] <brunoais> MikeD_, to pause what?
[07:02:15] <tall-adam> If someone could help me, I'm having an issue with ajax not loading nested objects in a json response.
[07:02:40] <brunoais> tall-adam, example input and jsfiddle it pls
[07:02:48] <Colonel_Panic> That's an archive of the files on my local machine.
[07:02:53] <erming> Bheam, think if it like this: http://jsfiddle.net/c2jwp/
[07:02:55] <erming> of*
[07:03:08] <MikeD_> brunoais: exactly, what is paused?  if you have an object acting as a model/controller for DOM acting as a view, then you want model.pause() - y/n ?
[07:03:42] <erming> however, if you add something to the $.fn object => you add the function/property to ALL jQuery objects
[07:03:59] <erming> (that is how you usually hook your plugins to jQuery)
[07:04:03] <brunoais> MikeD_, that's for js. More like shadow DOM than anything else
[07:04:46] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic,  do you want to try continuing where we both left off or are you done with his answer?
[07:05:35] <Bheam> what about.. $('.slideshow').data({pause: function() { ... }); $('.slideshow').data('pause')(); ?
[07:05:48] <Bheam> missing a } there but you get the idea
[07:05:55] <erming> never tried that, but it will probably work
[07:06:13] <erming> but just use $(".slideshow").pause = function() {}; in my opinion
[07:06:47] <Bheam> that won't work will it
[07:06:52] <erming> but you'll have to store the reference though
[07:07:03] <erming> var slideshow = $(".slideshow"); slideshow.pause = function() {};
[07:07:08] <Bheam> yea i won't be storing the reference
[07:07:08] <Colonel_Panic> I'm ready to continue
[07:07:09] <erming> and then just pass around "slideshow"-variable
[07:07:21] <Bheam> the entire point is to be able to access functions from outside the scope
[07:07:31] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, ok :). We were here: http://jsfiddle.net/brunoais/VgCZL/16/
[07:07:39] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, do you understand what is there?
[07:07:41] <erming> then do what brunoais said before: append your own function to $.fn
[07:07:55] <Sal> hi
[07:08:27] <erming> $.fn.pauseSlideshow = function() { var slideshow = this; this.hide(); };
[07:08:28] <erming> kind of
[07:08:32] <MikeD_> what makes the slideshow play?  can you have that function check the data.state?  then you can just update the data.state from "play" to "pause" and never need to interrupt the functions at all
[07:08:35] <frank_o> Anybody know why a fiddle is still available after one deletes it?
[07:08:38] <Bheam> when i define a $.fn function inside a scope where some variables are already set, will i have access to them from inside the function?
[07:09:07] <erming> as you see, looking at this variable: "$.fn", where $ is the jQuery object
[07:09:16] <erming> which is probably global in your case
[07:09:25] <Sal> does anyone know how i can insert html at the XXX point of the following html: <div class="row"><div class="col"></div><div class="col"></div>XXX</div>
[07:09:38] <Colonel_Panic> Yes, I understand what is happening there
[07:09:59] <brunoais> Sal, yes. Just use appendChild()
[07:10:03] <erming> anyhow, Bheam, try all the ways you can think of :> might give you some deeper knowledge what/what not works
[07:10:17] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, good :)
[07:10:19] <Sal> brunoais, to row div ?
[07:10:40] <brunoais> Sal, do you know what appendChild ()?
[07:10:50] <brunoais> *..is?
[07:10:51] <Bheam> erming: well i'm still confused how scopes work in javascript :p when i specify inline methods to functions that accept callbacks, they retain access to all variables in current scope
[07:11:05] <Colonel_Panic> But... again it's not working in my local machine
[07:11:07] <Bheam> but i suppose when i define a function in another scope that's another case
[07:11:22] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, but it is working on the fiddle, right?
[07:11:30] <Bheam> thanks i'll try some
[07:11:46] <erming> Bheam: http://jsfiddle.net/c2jwp/1/
[07:11:51] <Colonel_Panic> Yes, it works in JSfiddle
[07:11:57] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, call me by my username. iwth loads of different talk it may be hard for me to find your messages
[07:12:00] <Colonel_Panic> I just don't get why it breaks on my local
[07:12:12] <Colonel_Panic> brunoais: OK
[07:12:13] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, we'll get to that later
[07:13:02] <Colonel_Panic> OK, so the event has been captured and the text of the link has been returned to the alert()
[07:13:12] <erming> i need to stop procrastinate and start coding on my projects.. good luck Bheam :)
[07:13:22] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, next work is to change that alert(). Instead of displaying the contents of what was pressed, make it display the column number of what was clicked
[07:13:31] <Colonel_Panic> Is there a solution to this not working on my local machine?
[07:13:32] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, I think jQuery has a method for that
[07:13:39] <brunoais> (I think it is index()...)
[07:13:52] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, you are probably using the file: protocol
[07:13:55] <tall-adam> I'm having a problem loading nested objects with $.ajax in a json response.  Several of the keys are missing.  http://jsfiddle.net/HHt56/1/
[07:15:10] <brunoais> tall-adam, that's just a characteristic of console.log()
[07:15:25] <brunoais> it does not go fully inside each object and iterate on it
[07:15:26] <Colonel_Panic> So I want to use .get, correct?
[07:15:47] <Colonel_Panic> brunoais: .get(), correct?
[07:16:11] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, (use my username) hum... get() is to get the 1st unwapped DOM element it finds, right?
[07:16:21] <Colonel_Panic> brunoais: what other method is there to load a local JSON file?
[07:16:37] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, use a localhost server
[07:16:55] <Colonel_Panic> I have an apache server running now
[07:16:55] <brunoais> I think it was erming that gave an example of what you could do
[07:17:06] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, good. then use it
[07:17:42] <tall-adam> @brunoais, the key doesn't exist on the object, content[0].users evaluates to undefined
[07:20:14] <rindolf> Hi all.
[07:20:26] <Colonel_Panic> It's not working off my Apache server wither
[07:20:59] <Colonel_Panic> brunoais:  It's not working off my Apache server either. The page displays but the sorting functionalisy doesn't work
[07:21:37] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, You mean, the code I gave you?
[07:22:32] <brunoais> tall-adam, what you mention does not add up
[07:22:58] <brunoais> tall-adam, sounds more like you have shown wrong data to me (convinced that it is correct)
[07:24:51] <tall-adam> Haha it doesn't make much sense to me either.  Thanks for the help, I'll keep digging
[07:25:03] <brunoais> tall-adam, try making the request yourself
[07:25:17] <brunoais> then try feeding it to JSON.parse() yourself
[07:25:45] <Colonel_Panic> brunoais: no, it won't work at all locally
[07:26:04] <Colonel_Panic> brunoais: that was the problem I was having before
[07:26:29] <Colonel_Panic> Sorry if I seem a bit dopey, but I've been up half the night working on this thing
[07:27:42] <Colonel_Panic> on my local server, it displays the page but both your alert box and seutje's sorting mechanism don't do jack
[07:27:59] <Colonel_Panic> I don't know why
[07:28:13] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, what does the console say?
[07:28:28] <seutje> it says "jack will not be done today!"
[07:28:38] <Colonel_Panic> GET http://localhost/ [HTTP/1.1 200 OK 0ms]
[07:28:38] <Colonel_Panic> GET http://localhost/styles/main.css [HTTP/1.1 200 OK 0ms]

[07:28:44] <Colonel_Panic> Sorry
[07:29:04] <tall-adam> supertest in node gives me all the data very prettily.  I'll see which ajax library we're using and if there's a hitch there.
[07:29:23] <Colonel_Panic> No error messages
[07:30:13] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, PM me the contents of dataset.json that the browser says it has (firefox has such feature in the console)
[07:36:24] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, trouble :)?
[07:36:35] <Colonel_Panic> Just a sec...
[07:37:29] <Colonel_Panic> How do I activate that?
[07:37:45] <Colonel_Panic> The actual JSON file is in that archive I just posted
[07:37:53] <Colonel_Panic> the Sendspace address
[07:39:08] <Colonel_Panic> brunoais: http://www.sendspace.com/file/eakzht
[07:40:49] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, you need to think more, man
[07:40:55] <brunoais> see the options in the fiddle
[07:41:05] <Colonel_Panic> Hehe sorry
[07:41:06] <brunoais> do you think that it corresponds?
[07:41:10] <Colonel_Panic> I've been up all night
[07:41:34] <brunoais> use the $(document).ready()
[07:42:02] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, you need to learn not to make all nighters
[07:42:13] <brunoais> you don't produce more that if you don't
[07:42:16] <brunoais> it's an ilusion
[07:42:29] <brunoais> *s/that/than
[07:43:24] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, get some sleep. I'll help you tomorrow with you fresh
[07:43:39] <brunoais> that way you will not only have that done, you will learn what you are doing.
[07:44:07] <brunoais> I don't like "fishing" for others. I prefer to teach them to "fish" it themselves with me helping
[07:44:42] <Colonel_Panic> It's OK I'm having some coffee
[07:44:53] <Colonel_Panic> I'm up now for the long haul
[07:45:12] <Colonel_Panic> I understand how to bind event handlers and all that
[07:45:42] <Colonel_Panic> What I do not understand is why the same damn code that works in Fiddle is not working in my local machine
[07:46:08] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, because in the fiddle it is running only after the DOM is rendered
[07:46:27] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, in your situation, it is running while <body> doesn't even exist
[07:46:32] <Colonel_Panic> Also, I need to learn the mechanics of the sorting functionality
[07:46:48] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, you won't need much ;)
[07:46:56] <brunoais> js has a good sorting method
[07:47:02] <Colonel_Panic> So if I used document.ready() or somesuch
[07:47:09] <Colonel_Panic> it would work?
[07:47:24] <brunoais> Eh... what I gave you is a jQuery method, not a DOM method
[07:47:36] <Colonel_Panic> yes, I understand that
[07:47:45] <Colonel_Panic> But...
[07:47:47] <brunoais> if you use it correctly, then yes. it will work
[07:47:59] <Colonel_Panic> JQuery manipulates the DOM as well, doesn't it?
[07:48:12] <brunoais> yes it does but there's no such method in the DOM
[07:48:36] <Colonel_Panic> That's why seutje coded it up from scratch
[07:48:43] <Colonel_Panic> he used pure Javascript
[07:48:49] <seutje> wat? no
[07:48:54] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, what?
[07:48:56] <Colonel_Panic> you did not?
[07:49:00] <seutje> I used the jqueries
[07:49:06] <seutje> for binding and traversing
[07:49:09] <Colonel_Panic> Hold on, let me look at this again
[07:49:25] <Colonel_Panic> Oh OK
[07:49:27] <Colonel_Panic> you did
[07:49:32] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, get a bed, use it properly :D
[07:49:35] <Colonel_Panic> but you created your own sort() function
[07:49:41] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, no
[07:49:47] <brunoais> he use jQuery's sort method
[07:50:03] <Colonel_Panic> function sort(e)
[07:50:08] <brunoais> the DOM one is faster, though.  How faster depends on how you use it
[07:50:21] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, read the contents of that function
[07:50:35] <brunoais> it just tells which one is larger than which one
[07:51:18] <brunoais> the sorting algorithm is "hidden"
[07:51:33] <brunoais> I prefer to have the browser taking care of it. It is usually faster
[07:52:14] <Colonel_Panic> right, it just iteratively checks which is the "larger" value
[07:52:44] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, yeah...
[07:52:55] <Colonel_Panic> then moves the current one up or down accordingly, the moves on to the next value]
[07:53:03] <brunoais> My idea is to use this:https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/sort#Browser_compatibility
[07:53:20] <brunoais> ups :https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/sort
[07:53:40] <brunoais> fast furious and super simple
[07:54:01] <MikeD_> if you sort an array, are you going to rerender the DOM from the sorted array?
[07:54:04] <brunoais> much less code than seutje's and faster transversing; direct to the point
[07:54:32] <Colonel_Panic> Man I've been using canned solutions for so long, I've gotten really rusty at Javascript
[07:54:41] <brunoais> MikeD_, the idea is to remove the <tbody> from the DOM, use that method ot sort it and then re-placing it into the DOM :)
[07:54:55] <Colonel_Panic> That's cool.
[07:55:21] <seutje> brunoais: lolol are u saying Array.sort is faster than the sorting function I had implemented?
[07:55:22] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, ok, do you know already the position of the column that the user clicked?
[07:55:37] <brunoais> seutje, I seriously believe so!
[07:55:40] <seutje> cause that would be hilarious
[07:55:53] <brunoais> seutje, after I'm happy we can try jsperf for it :)
[07:56:00] <seutje> oh man...
[07:56:21] <seutje> foo.sort() and foo.sort(customfunction) isn't even functionally the same
[07:56:37] <brunoais> seutje, gimme the link again pls. So I can check your code out again
[07:56:38] <seutje> good luck getting the native Array.sort to magically figure out what to actually sort on
[07:56:49] <brunoais> seutje, It's on!
[07:57:02] <seutje> great, so ur making claims on shit you don't even recall?
[07:57:14] <brunoais> seutje, I don't remember all specifics
[07:57:20] <brunoais> only some key parts
[07:57:21] <seutje> yet you do make the claim
[07:57:28] <seutje> that's brilliant!
[07:57:31] <MikeD_> how many table rows are you sorting?
[07:57:38] <brunoais> seutje, sure because I thought about it while I still had it fresh in my mind
[07:57:42] <seutje> webdev in a nutshell right there!
[07:58:12] <brunoais> seutje, I just kept that idea in my mind, later I lost the details of your implementation
[07:58:35] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, trouble with that?
[07:59:16] <Colonel_Panic> No, just give me a second here
[08:00:24] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, tip: http://api.jquery.com/index/
[08:01:41] <bberry> im curious as to why jquery has the order of index,element,array for the array iteration methods
[08:01:53] <bberry> as opposed to javascripts element,index,array
[08:02:25] <brunoais> bberry, you mean the for(... in ...)?
[08:03:37] <Colonel_Panic> brunoais: http://jsfiddle.net/VgCZL/30/
[08:03:58] <Colonel_Panic> http://jsfiddle.net/VgCZL/31/
[08:04:45] <seutje> u know, if u don't add a THEAD and then tell it to only query children of a THEAD, it won't actually return much
[08:05:22] <seutje> just saying... http://jsfiddle.net/VgCZL/34/
[08:06:50] <Colonel_Panic> Yeah, that works
[08:07:17] <bberry> brunoais: http://jsfiddle.net/L3f4x/
[08:07:27] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, look at my fiddle
[08:07:28] <brunoais> http://jsfiddle.net/brunoais/VgCZL/24/
[08:07:37] <brunoais> there a lot of more changes I made including the HTML
[08:08:02] <brunoais> that's why your fiddle code does not work (besides you are doing an awful thing with that .html() method)
[08:08:10] <bberry> basically, javascript is [1,2,3].map(function(e,i,a){ return stuff }) and jquery is $([1,2,3]).map(function(i,e,a){ return stuff});
[08:08:56] <brunoais> seutje, that's true. However, with thead and tbody, it becomes much more tiddy and way easier to manage and sort
[08:11:12] <brunoais> bberry, AH! that. That's because jQuery uses the philosophy that the 1st param is the element in question
[08:11:30] <Colonel_Panic> http://jsfiddle.net/VgCZL/41/
[08:11:44] <brunoais> bberry, that's for all jQuery methods, if you notice
[08:12:36] <bberry> brunoais yeah, ive noticed it but never thought about it i guess. its interesting though. like in C code, you have acces to the index for a for loop, but in C++ iterators, the iterator IS the element, not the index
[08:12:36] <Colonel_Panic> brunoais: http://jsfiddle.net/VgCZL/40/
[08:12:50] <bberry> its sort of the same comparison. sort of.
[08:13:56] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, Awsome! Great! good job!
[08:14:02] <Colonel_Panic> so now that I have the index, I need to map that to the array from the JSON
[08:14:04] <brunoais> next
[08:14:10] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, NO!!!
[08:14:18] <Colonel_Panic> Oh for chrissakes
[08:14:21] <brunoais> you sort the elements of the DOM
[08:14:26] <brunoais> :)
[08:14:29] <Colonel_Panic> Ah right
[08:14:30] <Colonel_Panic> OK
[08:14:34] <brunoais> ^^
[08:14:53] <brunoais> for starters, you remove the tbody node from the table and store it in a variable
[08:15:19] <brunoais> I believe the jQuery method is called detach()
[08:20:28] <brunoais> now you should have the column number and the tbody tag (even if wrapped in jQuery) in 2 variables
[08:24:35] <apajo> a simple question: is switching multiple events (second) performance friendlier then attaching each event a separate function (first)? http://jsfiddle.net/zkBux/1/
[08:26:08] <pastry> apajo, there's only one less function declaration in the second example, but I think that's it
[08:27:20] <apajo> so basically it doesnt make any difference in speed?
[08:27:54] <apajo> in runtime i mean, i only declare the functions once, so that doesnt make much of a difference
[08:37:39] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, done?
[08:37:56] <Colonel_Panic> I'm having a little trouble
[08:38:20] <zizzl> Hey guys, I have a close button generated by .popup:before, and I tried to do jQuery('.popup:before').click( function() { jQuery(this).hide(); });  ... 1) is this possible? 2) how can I target it's .popup? (this).parent? not sure how it works with pseudo
[08:38:53] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, don't worry in asking me :). Show me what you have now and I can help you
[08:39:15] <Colonel_Panic> http://jsfiddle.net/VgCZL/48/
[08:39:16] <brunoais> zizzl, 1) No 2) N/A
[08:39:27] <zizzl> ha, dammit
[08:39:38] <zizzl> workaround? or just don't use pseudo if I need to target it
[08:39:59] <brunoais> zizzl, pseudo elements are for presentation only, not for interaction

[08:40:17] <zizzl> brunoais ok thanks
[08:40:19] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, Hum... get()?
[08:40:22] <Guest93196> Hi I function[A] that does a jqyery post to get data and then on success, it binds to a table.  I have button that calls function[B]. Function[B] calls function[A] but then does something right after function[A] call. The problem is that the code following function[A] needs to wait until function[A] is done.
[08:40:36] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, why get()? I want to know your logic :)
[08:41:09] <brunoais> Guest93196, use callbacks
[08:41:21] <brunoais> Guest93196, you may also use DOM events
[08:41:27] <brunoais> That's how I do it
[08:41:49] <Guest93196> I have call backs in Function[A], on success, bind to the grid.  But, in Function[B], after the grid is bound, then other code is run.
[08:41:59] <Colonel_Panic> trying to get the contents of the table cells
[08:42:01] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, brb +- 4 mins
[08:42:59] <Guest93196> oh.. callbacks. got it
[08:45:08] <MikeD_> evt.delegateTarget.children('ul > li.required').each( <-- error: Unable to get property 'each' of undefined or null reference.  suggestion?
[08:45:58] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, Hum... nice try but that's way too wrong :)
[08:46:12] <brunoais> Let's try working with that concept
[08:46:18] <brunoais> We are sorting rows
[08:46:30] <Colonel_Panic> Yeah, you know how I know it's wrong? It doesn't work.
[08:46:35] <brunoais> but the value we need to sort with is a specific td inside the row
[08:46:47] <Colonel_Panic> right
[08:46:47] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, I know just by looking at it :D
[08:46:53] <brunoais> there
[08:46:57] <brunoais> let's go by parts
[08:47:36] <Colonel_Panic> Ok first, I identified the column that we're sorting by
[08:47:40] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, for starters, change sortTable() make it receive 2 params. Can you guess what they are?
[08:47:52] <Colonel_Panic> put that in a variable called "columnIndex
[08:49:24] <Colonel_Panic> the columnIndex, and the row
[08:49:35] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, no
[08:49:41] <brunoais> that way it's impossible
[08:49:49] <brunoais> you don't want ot sort the row
[08:50:07] <brunoais> you want to sort the row in ... [insert here]
[08:50:41] <Colonel_Panic> the table ID?
[08:51:37] <Colonel_Panic> I don't know your approach to this problem
[08:51:39] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, Eh... no
[08:51:50] <brunoais> Ok so.
[08:52:04] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, what is the container of what we want to sort?
[08:52:17] <Colonel_Panic> The table body
[08:52:23] <brunoais> right
[08:52:29] <MikeD_> how do I get the number of elements in a collection?  var items = $("#foo").children("li");
[08:52:33] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, and we already have a pointer to the table body, right?
[08:52:43] <Colonel_Panic> yes
[08:52:52] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, nice
[08:52:58] <brunoais> then use those 2 as params
[08:53:04] <Colonel_Panic> but we want to pass the table ID to ths function to make it modular
[08:53:11] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, No
[08:53:23] <brunoais> actually sending the DOM node is even more modular :)
[08:53:30] <Colonel_Panic> so this function is specific only to this one table?
[08:53:32] <brunoais> believe me on that
[08:53:36] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, no
[08:53:40] <Colonel_Panic> OK
[08:53:41] <brunoais> it isn't even speicfic to a table
[08:54:02] <brunoais> it is just specific to a DOM element that contains DOM elements with siblings.
[08:54:07] <Colonel_Panic> OK
[08:54:24] <brunoais> ^^
[08:54:41] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, done?
[08:54:43] <Colonel_Panic> So the element index
[08:54:56] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, that's later in the sorting itself
[08:55:08] <brunoais> I mean, in the sorting callback
[08:55:17] <Colonel_Panic> OK...
[08:55:24] <MikeD_> 3 shall be the number of thy counting... 5 is right out.
[08:55:44] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, so, what do you have now?
[08:56:00] <herbySk> Hello, I see .load() event is deprecated. Does it mean also on("load", ...) is deprecated?
[08:56:22] <Colonel_Panic> well I know I'll be needing an iterator
[08:56:36] <Colonel_Panic> plus the DOM element to act on
[08:56:37] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, leave the iteration to the js engine
[08:56:42] <brunoais> for now
[08:56:56] <brunoais> we need to get an array out of the NodeList
[08:57:05] <Colonel_Panic> OK
[08:57:13] <duch_kazatel> yaaay
[08:57:19] <brunoais> to get the nodelist, use the thead.children
[08:57:29] <brunoais> then make an array with those elements
[08:58:30] <brunoais> ups
[08:58:35] <brunoais> I'd call it tbody
[08:58:37] <brunoais> or so
[08:58:43] <brunoais> anyway I hope I was clear
[08:58:49] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, ^
[08:59:20] <Colonel_Panic> so... var arr = [];
[08:59:22] <guzzlefry> hello
[08:59:36] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, yeah. that makes the array
[08:59:42] <guzzlefry> "//code.jquery.com/jquery-1.11.0.min.js"  <--- How does that work exactly? Without the http:
[08:59:50] <brunoais> guzzlefry, yes
[08:59:53] <duch_kazatel> guzzlefry same way it'd work without the domain.
[08:59:56] <brunoais> that is an URL fragment
[09:00:10] <MikeD_> guzzlefry: assumes whatever protocol the page is using
[09:00:11] <duch_kazatel> guzzlefry it's relative to the current url - you get the protocol of the current page.
[09:00:17] <guzzlefry> ah, gotcha
[09:00:17] <Colonel_Panic> then set up an iterator to step through the nodes
[09:00:22] <Colonel_Panic> ?
[09:00:55] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, you don't make an iterator. js takes care of that
[09:01:05] <brunoais> And yes, it is to iterate on that array
[09:01:29] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, may I see?
[09:02:11] <Colonel_Panic> There's nothing to see, really
[09:02:26] <Colonel_Panic> Still trying to work out how this is supposed to work
[09:02:34] <brunoais> Ok
[09:02:44] <Colonel_Panic> It's not much help to reveal little tidbits like this
[09:02:56] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, Hum...
[09:03:05] <Colonel_Panic> if you just explain the basic theory of how this is supposed to work
[09:03:06] <brunoais> you already know what is to be sorted, right?
[09:03:10] <Colonel_Panic> yeah
[09:03:15] <Colonel_Panic> the tbody
[09:03:23] <brunoais> did you make the code to get the children of tbody?
[09:03:47] <Colonel_Panic> so #dataTable tbody is to be passed to the function as a variable
[09:04:16] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, yeah... kinda. YOu already have the element you want, though. there's no need to search the DOM again
[09:04:18] <Colonel_Panic> no, I haven't.
[09:04:27] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, yes you have
[09:04:35] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, in the callback of the click event
[09:04:40] <Colonel_Panic> right, but
[09:04:43] <guzzlefry> http://pastebin.mozilla.org/5071901 <--- I'm getting $ is undefined errors. Why?
[09:05:08] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, ups. wrong code
[09:05:11] <brunoais> yes
[09:05:12] <brunoais> you are right
[09:05:20] <brunoais> you need to search for the tbody
[09:05:27] <guzzlefry> oh, I know. I'm accessing the html file via file:// :P
[09:05:34] <brunoais> search for it in the callback of the click event
[09:05:35] <duch_kazatel> guzzlefry that'd do it ;)
[09:07:54] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, sorry about that. Did you get it now?
[09:08:42] <Colonel_Panic> did you sent me a link?
[09:08:45] <Colonel_Panic> send'
[09:08:49] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, no.
[09:08:59] <brunoais> I'm trying to picture your current code
[09:09:19] <Colonel_Panic> What exactly am I supposed to do here?
[09:09:34] <duch_kazatel> jsfiddle?
[09:09:35] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, ok. In the click callback. search for the tbody
[09:09:40] <Colonel_Panic> right...
[09:09:48] <brunoais> then store in a variable
[09:10:04] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, then send the DOM element found to the function
[09:10:12] <Colonel_Panic>     $("#dataTable thead th").click(function() {
[09:10:12] <Colonel_Panic> 	        var index = $("#dataTable tbody th").index(this);
[09:10:23] <brunoais> ... ad one of the params
[09:10:46] <Colonel_Panic> wait... oops
[09:10:50] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, var index = this.index();
[09:11:25] <jimggg> to edit atrbitrary local plain text files, what's the state of the art solutions? no highlighting needed
[09:11:36] <brunoais> none
[09:12:19] <brunoais> if you have some flexibility you can take file uploading API, read the file, change it and then propose the file for downloading (all locally)
[09:12:49] <brunoais> all those require opening the file picker or having a drop zone
[09:13:20] <brunoais>  Colonel_Panic, var index = $(this).index(); // (sorry)
[09:13:23] <jimggg> what library should i be looking for?
[09:13:42] <brunoais> jimggg, tbh... I'd look at the DOM :D
[09:14:08] <jimggg> lol thanks:)
[09:14:28] <brunoais> that does not mean that there aren't libs or anything like that to help you
[09:17:14] <Colonel_Panic> I'm still not picking up where you;re going with this
[09:17:33] <Colonel_Panic> I've looked at a number of different approaches on the Web
[09:17:59] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, give me what you have pls
[09:18:19] <Colonel_Panic> http://jsfiddle.net/VgCZL/50/
[09:18:30] <Sal> getting crazy on it
[09:18:32] <Sal> http://pastebin.com/GA4Zcbv5
[09:18:43] <Sal> how can i insert more html there?
[09:19:27] <BillCriswell> Sal: $('.row').append('htmls')
[09:19:36] <Sal> i'm doing  var place = $('.row:last');
[09:19:36] <Sal>     place.append(myHtml);
[09:19:57] <Sal> Bill. that will appen on all .row
[09:19:57] <zizzl> Hey guys on this http://jsfiddle.net/w4EMz/6/ why isn't the close button closing the popup?
[09:20:15] <BillCriswell> I didn't notice there was two.
[09:20:24] <Sal> there could be many
[09:20:33] <ElisaCT> hi guys
[09:20:40] <Sal> its an infinite scrolling
[09:21:04] <Colonel_Panic> Can you please explain the methodology behind what you're expecting me to do?
[09:21:21] <Sal> so it should simply be:  $('.row:last').append('htmls')
[09:21:22] <Sal> no?
[09:21:26] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, I've made some changes (explanation ahead)
[09:21:27] <brunoais> http://jsfiddle.net/VgCZL/49/
[09:21:29] <brunoais> ups
[09:21:34] <brunoais> http://jsfiddle.net/brunoais/VgCZL/51/
[09:21:45] <BillCriswell> Sal: That should work.
[09:21:55] <Sal> but it doesn't
[09:22:01] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, I revived your sorting funciton because it was quite good
[09:22:13] <Sal> it adds html after the closing div or .row
[09:22:14] <brunoais> I made the click callback as I was trying to help you
[09:22:44] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, I also made the 1st line of sortContent same with its params
[09:23:05] <BillCriswell> Sal: http://jsbin.com/vegineva/1/edit?html,js,output yes it does.
[09:23:58] <Sal> damn, then i'm messing again
[09:23:59] <Sal> thanks
[09:24:01] <rindolf> Sal: can you show a reproducing example for your problem?
[09:24:10] <rindolf> Sal: maybe try reducing it.
[09:24:11] <BillCriswell> Sal: No problem.
[09:24:14] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, there's still the sort callback to fix, placing the LiveNodeList into an array (that is the one that is sorted). You already have a kunky code for making the nodes appear correctly
[09:24:39] <Sal> rindolf, difficult, data is from php
[09:24:47] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, does that help?
[09:25:38] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, as for the sorting callback. It is nearly correct. It just needs some minor fixing (that does all the diffrence)
[09:26:30] <rindolf> Sal: you can use Firefox's "Save As".
[09:26:40] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, for the: placing the nodes into place; The main logic is correct but it is dead slow to execute as you are searching the DOM too many times. Besides the DOM APi related to it is super stable, so you can use the DOM directly to make it faster
[09:27:41] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, are my tips helping?
[09:29:46] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, Hum... by the jQuery manual, seems like, with jQuery, you don't even need to iterate the array of nodes to insert. You may just give it the array into the .append() method
[09:29:52] <brunoais> source: https://api.jquery.com/append/
[09:33:52] <Colonel_Panic> brunoais: looking it over now
[09:33:58] <brunoais> :)
[09:35:29] <Colonel_Panic> OK so you're keeping the original sort function... but this is supposed to be usable in any DOM structure, not just tables?
[09:36:29] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, yes. In that function I onlly changed the 1st line
[09:36:45] <brunoais> the rest needs improving or some changing
[09:37:19] <zizzl> Hey guys on this http://jsfiddle.net/w4EMz/6/ why isn't the close button closing the popup?
[09:37:28] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, for starters, you need to make a clone of that LiveNodeList as it is read-only
[09:37:42] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, do you want that code snippet?
[09:40:06] <Colonel_Panic> make a clone?
[09:40:28] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, no. if you clone you get a copy of the Nodes. YOu don't want to lose the nodes you have
[09:40:38] <brunoais> making new nodes cost too much for a job like this
[09:41:00] <rindolf> zizzl: let me see.
[09:41:16] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, just copy the references to the DOM nodes
[09:41:44] <brunoais> it's an array-like object, so it's just as making a "clone" of an array
[09:42:02] <brunoais> iterate on A and copy element into next position of B
[09:42:07] <Colonel_Panic> Can't I recycle the function to draw the rows and table?
[09:42:21] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, bad idea, usually
[09:42:36] <Colonel_Panic> why?
[09:42:46] <brunoais> too much work going on to do that
[09:42:50] <sanman> hi, does anybody know about ImageMapster?
[09:43:00] <brunoais> for larger tables, it can lockup while sorting
[09:43:17] <sanman> I want to be able to click on parts of an imagemap, and have them briefly light up and then go back to normal
[09:44:15] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, besides, if you remake the elements, you are no longer making a reusable function ;)
[09:44:38] <BillCriswell> sanman: I'm not familiar with imagemapster but I've done what you're trying before.
[09:45:14] <zizzl> rindolf thanks man
[09:45:31] <Colonel_Panic> What's wrong with the sorting function?
[09:47:36] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, you are not getting the actual data you want, you don't use the "index" variable
[09:47:50] <dwarder> if i have an array and sometimes i will have undefined values for certain indexes, what are other wayt to prevent error:Uncaught TypeError: cannot read property '27' of undefined
[09:47:54] <dwarder> i tried if(typeof boardData[55][23]!=='undefined'){
[09:47:55] <dwarder> still have the same error
[09:48:05] <sanman> BillCriswell: hi, how did you do your thing?
[09:49:00] <BillCriswell> sanman: I basically used three layers. At the bottom was basically the inactive state for all items, the middle layer was swapped based on the image map ( the top layer ).
[09:49:10] <sanman> yes, that's what I did too
[09:49:21] <sanman> and I used Imagemapster to do this
[09:49:46] <dwarder> anyone?
[09:49:57] <sanman> but my problem is that once I've clicked on the area, it still stays lit (swapped)
[09:50:07] <duch_kazatel> dwarder you need to check each "level" manually.
[09:50:16] <dwarder> duch_kazatel: what do you mean?
[09:50:16] <BillCriswell> sanman: Set a timeout and fade it out when you're done.
[09:50:21] <sanman> hmm
[09:50:28] <dwarder> duch_kazatel: ahh
[09:50:34] <duch_kazatel> boardData, boardData[55], and boardData[55][23] - you'd have to check each of those manually.
[09:50:34] <dwarder> duch_kazatel: got it
[09:50:37] <duch_kazatel> :)
[09:50:42] <dwarder> duch_kazatel: danke ;)
[09:50:47] <sanman> I tried this:
[09:50:49] <sanman> setTimeout(function () { $(this).mapster('deselect') }, 1000);
[09:50:49] <Colonel_Panic> brunoais: http://jsfiddle.net/VgCZL/52/
[09:50:50] <zizzl> rindolf nothing?
[09:51:02] <sanman> I also tried this:
[09:51:15] <sanman> setTimeout('', 3000);
[09:51:17] <sanman> $(this).mapster('deselect');
[09:51:18] <zizzl> Hey guys on this http://jsfiddle.net/w4EMz/6/ why isn't the close button closing the popup? This should take one of you guys like 3 seconds to figure out
[09:51:19] <duch_kazatel> zizzl you're having a delegation problem ;)
[09:51:41] <BillCriswell> sanman: I'm not familiar with mapster enough to help you there.
[09:51:44] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, you still don't use the "index" variable :)
[09:51:47] <sanman> ah ok
[09:52:22] <duch_kazatel> zizzl when you clock close, the click event is bubbling up and hitting .reason, triggering the click again.
[09:52:57] <duch_kazatel> zizzl so you need to stop the propagation of the event.
[09:53:02] <rindolf> zizzl: found it!
[09:53:17] <duch_kazatel> rindolf all ready beat you :)
[09:53:17] <rindolf> zizzl: the problem is that the callback for .reason gets pressed again.
[09:53:24] <zizzl> duch_kazatel how so
[09:54:58] <duch_kazatel> zizzl stopImmediatePropagation
[09:55:03] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/w4EMz/10/
[09:55:11] <Colonel_Panic> I'm using it on line 97, aren't I?
[09:55:30] <Sal> BillCriswell, i found the problem
[09:55:52] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, you are defining it on line 97 :). If you don't use inside the function is as if you had never used it in the first place
[09:56:01] <rindolf> zizzl: here's a workaround - http://jsfiddle.net/w4EMz/12/
[09:56:09] <BillCriswell> Sal: Niiice.
[09:56:37] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, 1st things 1st. Make a copy of the NodeList into an array.
[09:56:48] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, then sort that array
[09:56:56] <Sal> its not the last row
[09:56:57] <Sal> http://pastebin.com/jMMx3xBf
[09:56:59] <Sal> look
[09:57:02] <duch_kazatel> rindolf that's bad.
[09:57:15] <Sal> i need to insert html in the row before the last row
[09:57:19] <Sal> how can i do that?
[09:57:22] <Sal> have no idea now
[09:57:40] <duch_kazatel> rindolf that's a lot of extra logic when all zizzl needs to do is stop the propagation of the click event.
[09:57:45] <Sal> thats why it wasn't working before, because i was adding on the wrong row
[09:58:12] <rindolf> duch_kazatel: OK.
[09:58:33] <duch_kazatel> rindolf that's why you just do this: http://jsfiddle.net/w4EMz/10/
[09:58:35] <rindolf> Sal: you can put it in an array and use the arr[arr.length - 2]
[09:59:09] <rindolf> duch_kazatel: ah, OK.
[10:00:12] <zizzl> duch_kazatel thanks!
[10:00:23] <duch_kazatel> zizzl of course.
[10:00:40] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, done?
[10:03:03] <Sal> rindolf, !!! what! how's that?
[10:03:13] <rindolf> Sal: how's what?
[10:03:26] <Sal> put in an array
[10:03:30] <rindolf> Sal: maybe arr[-2] will work.
[10:03:32] <Sal> wait, let me think on it
[10:03:34] <Sal> hehehe
[10:03:34] <rindolf> But with JS - who can tell?
[10:03:59] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, what do you have now?
[10:04:07] <Colonel_Panic> Should I use document.querySelectorAll?
[10:04:22] <waspinator> I'm trying to remove a row from a table by fading it out and then sliding it up, but I can't get a smooth slideUp working. what am I doing wrong?
[10:04:23] <waspinator> http://jsfiddle.net/waspinator/tvhyA/2/
[10:04:31] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, if you want to. You definitely don't need, though
[10:04:42] <Colonel_Panic> I'm fumbling around here, trying to figure out how these parts work together
[10:04:53] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, what do you have now?
[10:05:03] <Colonel_Panic> http://jsfiddle.net/VgCZL/53/
[10:05:15] <rindolf> Sal: anyway, please consider adding an id attribute to the element you wish to manipulate.
[10:05:45] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, http://jsfiddle.net/brunoais/VgCZL/54/
[10:05:50] <brunoais> does it help?
[10:06:53] <Sal> rindolf, i have n divs with row class
[10:06:59] <Sal> can' put an id on each
[10:07:19] <rindolf> Sal: OK.
[10:07:26] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, see id this helps clearing your thoughts :) http://jsfiddle.net/brunoais/VgCZL/55
[10:07:33] <rindolf> Sal: then put them in an array and subscript it.
[10:07:33] <zizzl> duch_kazatel so trying to understand the bubbling up, so you're saying on the .click of the close button it triggers the .click of the .popup too? so it hides then shows immediately so I don't see it
[10:07:56] <rindolf> Sal: I think the $(...) returns an array.
[10:08:12] <duch_kazatel> zizzl right - event bubbling.
[10:08:15] <brunoais> rindolf, It's an object-ish array-like element :)
[10:08:34] <rindolf> brunoais: ah.
[10:08:54] <zizzl> duch_kazatel still don't really get why it would do that but I understand..
[10:10:15] <duch_kazatel> zizzl bubbling is an old DOM thing - i'd go google it and read up.
[10:10:40] <duch_kazatel> but that's basically why you can bind a listener to a div, then click on a child span, and still have the event fire on the div.
[10:12:43] <Sal> var arr = $('.row');
[10:12:52] <Sal> rindolf, will that do it?
[10:13:38] <rindolf> Sal: yes, it will.
[10:13:58] <Sal> and how can i get the index previous the last?
[10:14:03] <rindolf> Sal: then you can do «var row = arr[arr.length - 2]»
[10:14:05] <Sal> is there a way to get the last index?
[10:14:08] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, what do you have now?
[10:14:16] <Sal> or the total elements
[10:14:23] <rindolf> Sal: arr.length
[10:14:26] <Sal> oh!
[10:14:28] <Sal> ok
[10:14:49] <Colonel_Panic> Can you please explain how these parts are supposed to work together? Just give an overview
[10:14:56] <Sal> arr[arr.length-2].append(myHtml);
[10:15:02] <Sal> am i leaning well?
[10:15:05] <Sal> hehehe
[10:15:14] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, sortContent is in 3 parts
[10:15:17] <Colonel_Panic> this is like trying to build a house with directions on how long to cut the boards, but with no blueprint
[10:15:38] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, 1st: get a copy of the live node list into an array.
[10:15:51] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, 2nd: sort the array
[10:16:16] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, 3rd: Use the sorted array to place the nodes back into the DOM correctly sorted, now
[10:16:24] <Colonel_Panic> By the live node list, you mean the table cells present in #dataTable tbody, correct?
[10:16:34] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, correct
[10:16:48] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, It's the content in the tableRows variable
[10:17:10] <Colonel_Panic> And I don't need to use document.querySelectorAll?
[10:17:18] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, correct
[10:17:23] <dwarder> if i use var copy1= new myFuncName() and inside that func i define this.var, when i do var copy2= new myFuncName i get copy of the same object? i.e. changing copy1 affects copy2
[10:17:26] <dwarder> ?
[10:17:53] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, the DOM transversing is so small that using that would be a huge waste (and making it not compatible with some browsers that, otherwise, would be
[10:17:57] <MikeD_> dwarder: no, each instance has its own property
[10:18:23] <dwarder> hmm..
[10:18:42] * dwarder ask himself "where have i mistaken"
[10:18:47] <dwarder> asks*
[10:18:56] <MikeD_> dwarder: what are you trying to accomplish?
[10:19:49] <Colonel_Panic> "var sortingElements = [tableRows];"?
[10:20:31] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, no. You have to iterate on it. Colonel_Panic just like in Java, or any .Net variant
[10:22:49] <ktownhero> Hi all, quick question
[10:23:02] <duch_kazatel> just ask :)
[10:23:13] <rindolf> ktownhero: hi.
[10:23:43] <ktownhero> I have a series of tds wrapped in a div with an id of  "group" and i want to grab just those tds, how can I do that?
[10:23:50] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, gimme what you got pls
[10:23:57] <duch_kazatel> $('#group td')
[10:24:03] <ktownhero> I am currently using $('td') which grabs everything in the whole markup file, i just want the ones under the id
[10:24:14] <duch_kazatel> ktownhero - $('#group td')
[10:24:17] <duch_kazatel> just like in CSS>
[10:24:23] <ktownhero> hmmm, i thought i tried that -- let me give it another go
[10:24:25] <Colonel_Panic> OK so as far as I can tell, what we;re doing here is
[10:25:30] <Colonel_Panic> responding to a click on a header cell by identifying its index
[10:26:30] <ktownhero> hmmm, that doesn't seem to work for me
[10:26:38] <duch_kazatel> ktownhero mind sharing a fiddle then?
[10:26:41] <duch_kazatel> of at least your html?
[10:26:59] <ktownhero> sure
[10:27:26] <ktownhero> I'm trying to highlight columns in the table using this function (which works with just $('td')
[10:27:36] <ktownhero>    $('#checkGroup td').hover(function() {
[10:27:36] <ktownhero>                         var t = parseInt($(this).index()) + 1;
[10:27:36] <ktownhero>                         $('td:nth-child(' + t + ')').addClass('highlighted');
[10:27:36] <ktownhero>                     },
[10:27:36] <ktownhero>                     function() {
[10:27:37] <ktownhero>                         var t = parseInt($(this).index()) + 1;
[10:27:39] <ktownhero>                         $('td:nth-child(' + t + ')').removeClass('highlighted');
[10:27:40] <duch_kazatel> ktownhero noooo.
[10:27:41] <ktownhero>                     });
[10:27:43] <duch_kazatel> !paste @ ktownhero
[10:27:43] <b-ot> ktownhero: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[10:27:59] <ktownhero> ok
[10:28:25] <waspinator> what's the best way of sliding table rows up and down?
[10:28:26] <Colonel_Panic> then passing that index in a variable to the sortContent function along with the tbody variable
[10:28:57] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, sorry but I g2g. I can continue helping you in about 50 mins if you want.
[10:29:15] <Colonel_Panic> This is what I got http://jsfiddle.net/VgCZL/58/
[10:29:21] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, because I g2g I made the minimal minor changes to the latest nearly-working example you had
[10:29:42] <Colonel_Panic> What's the URL?
[10:30:09] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, http://jsfiddle.net/brunoais/VgCZL/57/
[10:30:17] <brunoais> it is quite bad working but it works
[10:30:38] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, I only made 2 code changes
[10:31:00] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, 1 variable change and the line where I pply the push method
[10:31:08] <Colonel_Panic> OK
[10:31:09] <brunoais> I can explain that when I'm back, if you want
[10:31:29] <Colonel_Panic> OK I'll be back in about an hour then
[10:39:15] <ktownhero> ok i have a basic jfiddle set up which shows my issue, should i paste the link here or privately?
[10:41:10] <bakflash> hello there, is there some kind of event for jquery that is triggered when a html element gets visible or passed? ( I want to do something when </article> is passed)
[10:41:22] <duch_kazatel> "passed"?
[10:41:29] <bakflash> hmm
[10:41:30] <duch_kazatel> you mean the mouse goes over it?
[10:41:35] <bakflash> duch_kazatel: nah
[10:42:07] <ktownhero> http://jsfiddle.net/7AXvf/
[10:43:01] <duch_kazatel> ktownhero that's not valid js btw.
[10:43:02] <bakflash> duch_kazatel: well my english is unfortunately kinda limited - well I want to do do something when a user scrolls down and 'passes' the end of my article tag (</article) -> articles have a different height / there are comments below -> so a simple "page end reached" isn't enough - hope this is clear now :S
[10:43:59] <duch_kazatel> bakflash ah, you want to know when it becomes visible in the current page
[10:44:05] <bakflash> duch_kazatel: exactly
[10:44:26] <duch_kazatel> you'll have to hook into the scroll and check if you've hit the vertical position of that particular article.
[10:44:30] <duch_kazatel> or of any given article.
[10:44:37] <Sal> help! whats wrong here http://goo.gl/zmSO2r
[10:44:43] <ktownhero> duch, js isn't my strong suit (obviously) but that function does work for testing if you remove the #checkGroup reference
[10:44:45] <bakflash> hmm makes sense duch_kazatel
[10:44:53] <ktownhero> so i'm just wondering, how do i get it to work with the reference?
[10:44:53] <duch_kazatel> ktownhero you're missing a closing curely.
[10:44:55] <duch_kazatel> *curly.
[10:45:05] <duch_kazatel> what reference?  the $(this)?
[10:45:35] <guzzlefry> Are there any guides/resources for writing clean jQuery code?
[10:45:44] <ktownhero> the very first line $('#checkGroup td') doesn't work
[10:46:01] <guzzlefry> Mine ends up being 8 billion nests deep.
[10:46:54] <bakflash> duch_kazatel: can you tell me how I get the position of a *closing* tag? :)
[10:46:57] <duch_kazatel> because there's somehting invalid about your JS.
[10:47:43] <ktownhero> well, it works if you just change it to $('td'), for all tds on the page of course
[10:47:50] <tw2113> guzzlefry, i imagine any javascript clean code book/tutorial would help out a lot
[10:47:51] <ktownhero> i'm trying to limit it to only the tds under that group
[10:48:01] <tw2113> or clean code books in general, not just js/jquery
[10:48:04] <guzzlefry> okay, I'll look into that , thanks
[10:48:05] <ktownhero> there's no missing curly brace, but if there's something else invalid then i'm all ears i just don't know what it is
[10:48:06] <duch_kazatel> bakflash you don't want that ;)  check out the offset() method, and then the height() method.
[10:48:14] <duch_kazatel> ktownhero my console is throwing an error.
[10:48:22] <duch_kazatel> ah i see it.
[10:48:23] <duch_kazatel> one sec.
[10:48:31] <tw2113> guzzlefry, i'm in the early parts of http://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1399312096&sr=8-1&keywords=clean+code
[10:48:32] <bakflash> duch_kazatel: oke! :) I tried (..).position().top and bottom but bottom was always null..
[10:48:57] <duch_kazatel> ktownhero this code is invalid.
[10:49:06] <duch_kazatel> ktownhero you cannot have a div as a direct child of a tr.
[10:49:25] <ktownhero> ah
[10:49:34] <duch_kazatel> that explains a lot.
[10:49:34] <ktownhero> well that would explain it
[10:49:38] <duch_kazatel> :)
[10:49:56] <ktownhero> hmmmm
[10:49:57] <duch_kazatel> bakflash right - you need to get the top, and then add the height of the element ;)
[10:50:12] <bakflash> duch_kazatel: yeah did it already, works flawless. cool! :)
[10:51:22] <bakflash> duch_kazatel: and now I shall compare it with scrollTop - that's what you mean?
[10:51:29] <duch_kazatel> bakflash huh?\
[10:51:31] <ktownhero> thanks for taking a look at that duch, i'll have to figure out some other way to solve my problem
[10:51:45] <ktownhero> this is a procedurally generated set of td elements via Wicket, so i'll go back to the drawing board
[10:51:48] <duch_kazatel> ktownhero you can put that ID on the TR.
[10:51:51] <duch_kazatel> ktownhero ah.
[10:52:16] <duch_kazatel> bakflash why do you care about the bottom of an element>?
[10:52:20] <ktownhero> yeah, unfortunately i have a subset of the td elements only that i want this function to be tied to
[10:52:33] <ktownhero> i might need to put a table inside the table, something like that
[10:52:37] <duch_kazatel> ktownhero then attach a class to them and be done :)
[10:52:53] <ktownhero> true
[10:53:06] <bakflash> duch_kazatel: to be exact: I want to trigger an google analytics event when the reader passes the end of the article (or at least the end gets visible)
[10:54:00] <duch_kazatel> bakflash that's... almost excessive imo, but you'll need to compare the current window's scrolltop against that article's bottom position.
[10:54:51] <bakflash> duch_kazatel: why excessive? :)
[10:55:37] <duch_kazatel> are you tracking impressions of articles?
[10:56:26] <duch_kazatel> just trying to understand why that information would be useful.
[10:56:30] <bakflash> duch_kazatel: I want to know if the reader reads the article or jumps back
[10:57:29] <duch_kazatel> ah you mean on the current page?
[10:57:38] <bakflash> duch_kazatel: exactly
[10:57:48] <duch_kazatel> i'd just look at the time they spent on the page, but meh.
[10:59:20] <bakflash> duch_kazatel: well this isn't possible *when* the user leaves the page onto another website (go back to google)
[11:00:45] <duch_kazatel> if you're using GA, that is possible.
[11:00:59] <bakflash> duch_kazatel: you are kidding me, right? :D
[11:01:02] <duch_kazatel> bu
[11:01:06] <duch_kazatel> ff cutroni.com/blog/2012/02/29/understanding-google-analytics-time-calculations/
[11:01:08] <duch_kazatel> there you go.
[11:05:28] <ktownhero> If I want to run my jquery in a separate js file, how do i get it to work properly?  calls to just $('blah') don't seem to work
[11:05:58] <duch_kazatel> load jquery, put code in the separate file, and if your code relies on anything in the DOM make sure it's wrapped in a document ready.
[11:06:11] <duch_kazatel> $(document).ready(function(){}); or just $(function(){});
[11:07:02] <bakflash> duch_kazatel: huh? But does almost the same as I wanted to do, doesnt it?
[11:07:09] <waspinator> what's the best way of sliding table rows up and down?
[11:07:49] <duch_kazatel> bakflash huh?
[11:08:12] <duch_kazatel> !g jquery slideUp
[11:08:14] <b-ot> duch_kazatel: .slideUp() | jQuery API Documentation → https://api.jquery.com/slideUp/
[11:08:16] <duch_kazatel> waspinator ^^
[11:08:26] <duch_kazatel> waspinator unless you mean something different.
[11:08:28] <BillCriswell> waspinator: I don't trust messing with tables like that haha.
[11:08:45] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: Would a tr animate smoothly you think?
[11:08:53] <BillCriswell> Curious now.
[11:08:54] <waspinator> it doesn't animate at all
[11:09:01] <duch_kazatel> waspinator mind sharing some html?
[11:09:02] <waspinator> just disappears
[11:09:04] <bakflash> duch_kazatel: yeah, the article says "Google Analytics uses the last "engagement hit" to measure time on page when there is only one pageview during a visit."
[11:09:20] <waspinator> http://jsfiddle.net/waspinator/tvhyA/2/
[11:09:21] <bakflash> duch_kazatel: and referring to articles where you implement javascript to 'fire' these engagement hits
[11:09:56] <waspinator> I've read around that jquery doesn't like tables, but I hoped someone made a plugin or something
[11:10:14] <bakflash> waspinator: no on lines tables :p (ok sorry, jk)
[11:10:29] <duch_kazatel> waspinator ah.  interesting.
[11:10:47] <duch_kazatel> bakflash doesn't it consider a bounce as an engagement hit?
[11:11:02] <BillCriswell> It's nost jquery that has the issue with tables, it's just tables have an issue with everything lol
[11:11:09] <duch_kazatel> ^^ word
[11:11:49] <bakflash> duch_kazatel: I'm a douchebag.. Okay, I've learned something today. Thank you! :)
[11:12:05] <duch_kazatel> bakflash :) it's not douchy.  i was actually asking.
[11:12:44] <bakflash> duch_kazatel: aah.. but it counts as engagement, the articles refers to have extra engagements to see exactly how far the reader reads
[11:12:52] <duch_kazatel> bakflash aaah okay
[11:13:16] <duch_kazatel> and slideUp() and its ilk probably don't work like you'd expect because they're not display: block;
[11:13:32] <waspinator> found something for slideup https://github.com/jisaacks/jquery.rowslide
[11:13:48] <waspinator> not perfect http://jsfiddle.net/waspinator/S4ZL7/1/
[11:14:15] <BillCriswell> Did not even slide.
[11:15:10] <waspinator> if you click on slideup it should work.
[11:15:23] <waspinator> slide down would be nice too
[11:15:30] <BillCriswell> I just get an empty row.
[11:16:05] <waspinator> oh. yeah doesn't work with chrome
[11:16:07] <BillCriswell> http://i.imgur.com/gamRpzV.png
[11:16:07] <waspinator> only firefox
[11:16:21] <waspinator> just tested that... oh well
[11:16:23] <duch_kazatel> waspinator any reason you HAVE to use a table?
[11:17:19] <waspinator> I guess I could build a table out of divs. but it just makes sense to build a table using the <table> thing
[11:17:34] <duch_kazatel> tables are great for tabular data.
[11:17:40] <waspinator> that's what I have
[11:17:44] <duch_kazatel> mmk.
[11:17:53] <waspinator> I just want to remove/add some with ajax
[11:18:07] <duch_kazatel> ah, with animations?
[11:18:08] <BillCriswell> waspinator: That's fine, just the animating of them sucks.
[11:18:11] <waspinator> yeah
[11:18:20] <waspinator> but animations!
[11:18:28] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, I'm back
[11:18:39] <Colonel_Panic> Hey
[11:18:55] <Colonel_Panic> I'm trying to work out the functioning of this code
[11:19:03] <Colonel_Panic> check this out:
[11:19:20] <BillCriswell> Adding a background color to them when they're added for a certain amount of time can work maybe waspinator.
[11:20:39] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, (you didn't send yet)
[11:21:42] <waspinator> like highlight you mean? yeah that could work too I guess. maybe there's a jquery plugin that can transform tables into divs
[11:22:10] <duch_kazatel> waspinator not in the way you'll want.
[11:22:15] <duch_kazatel> i'm guessing, at least.
[11:22:22] <duch_kazatel> that's a lot of DOM munging to get your stuff to work.
[11:23:08] <ElisaCT> I'm using AJAX LOAD to load content from a HTML file into a div, but when I hit a link inside that content, instead of using the AJAX LOAD it becomes a regular link, what I'm doing wrong?
[11:23:22] <BillCriswell> tables normally just end up a giant pain in the balls anyway.
[11:23:41] <ElisaCT> its like if what's inside the loaded content is not using the js from the other page
[11:24:13] <duch_kazatel> ElisaCT because your event handlers aren't bound.
[11:24:20] <duch_kazatel> ElisaCT look at event delegation.
[11:24:21] <ElisaCT> duch_kazatel: how can I bound them
[11:24:29] <BillCriswell> ElisaCT: You probably want to do $(document).on('click', 'a', function(){ ... }); instead of $('a').on('click', function(){ ... });
[11:24:30] <duch_kazatel> bind to the parent element and let bubbling handle the rest.
[11:24:30] <disappearedng> Hey any recommendations for a visual grid plugin? I would like to be able to say (row,column) (5,6)-(12,6) should be pink
[11:24:41] <ElisaCT> ohhhh
[11:24:45] <duch_kazatel> avoid binding to document IMO, but BillCriswell has the basic gist for you.
[11:24:51] <BillCriswell> Yes.
[11:24:54] <ElisaCT> why should I avoid it?
[11:25:05] <duch_kazatel> you'll filter on EVERY click in the page.
[11:25:09] <Colonel_Panic> brunoais: http://pastebin.com/1vCSXZXA
[11:25:11] <duch_kazatel> you only care about the ones in a given area.
[11:25:11] <ElisaCT> maybe (document a).on ?
[11:25:22] <BillCriswell> disappearedng: You would write a function for that pretty quickly.
[11:25:41] <disappearedng> BillCriswell: And what should I be using for the elements
[11:25:43] <Colonel_Panic> is that a fair understanding of how that code works?
[11:25:51] <duch_kazatel> electronicmaji no.
[11:25:54] <duch_kazatel> err, ElisaCT no
[11:26:01] <BillCriswell> disappearedng: I was thinking you were using a table.
[11:26:02] <duch_kazatel> ElisaCT what's the container you're appending things into?
[11:26:39] <disappearedng> BillCriswell: Actually yeah I think I can write one pretty easily too thanks
[11:26:55] <ElisaCT> duch_kazatel: its a <div>
[11:27:11] <duch_kazatel> ElisaCT give it a class or id.
[11:27:19] <ElisaCT> I'm giving it a class
[11:27:23] <duch_kazatel> what's the class?>
[11:27:24] <ElisaCT> div id= body
[11:27:41] <ElisaCT> an id I mean
[11:27:42] <duch_kazatel> should every a tag run your logic?
[11:28:17] <BillCriswell> disappearedng: http://jsbin.com/tojos/2/edit?js,output is what I was thinking.
[11:28:34] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic,  "// Invoke the JQuery "sort" method on the 'sortingElements' array" <- that one is wrong
[11:28:50] <brunoais> It's not jQuery's sort. It is Array.prototype's
[11:29:01] <BillCriswell> Should probably wrap that up in a IIFE or whatever.
[11:29:02] <brunoais> it's a method from the Array object
[11:29:02] <duch_kazatel> ElisaCT $('#body').on('click', 'a', function(){}); - replace that 'a' with whatever you're selecting on now.
[11:29:10] <Colonel_Panic> Hmmm OK
[11:29:42] <ElisaCT> duch_kazatel: checking! thanks!
[11:30:09] <disappearedng> BillCriswell: Pretty nice there
[11:30:56] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, your sorting logis is not that correct. Careful. "-1" does not mean to shift 1 down. You are only saying if A has a value smaller/larger/equal than/to B
[11:31:23] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, it only cares if if the value is < 0, 0 or > 0
[11:31:44] <Colonel_Panic> Ah, O
[11:31:45] <Colonel_Panic> OK
[11:31:46] <brunoais> as long as you give it that, it does not care about the actual number value
[11:32:19] <ElisaCT> duch_kazatel: WORKS LIKE CHARM!
[11:32:22] <ElisaCT> Thanks ;-)))))0
[11:32:24] <ElisaCT> wiiiiiiiiiii
[11:32:27] <duch_kazatel> ElisaCT of course
[11:32:37] <duch_kazatel> go read the docs for .on() to learn more.
[11:32:38] <Colonel_Panic> so what does the -1 mean, exactly?
[11:32:49] <Colonel_Panic> brunoais: so what does the -1 mean, exactly?
[11:33:05] <Sal> http://goo.gl/zmSO2r
[11:33:05] <ElisaCT> thanks duch_kazatel ;-)))))
[11:33:08] <ElisaCT> really, thank you!
[11:33:10] <Sal> help, please
[11:33:14] <ElisaCT> I've been all night with this one
[11:33:16] <BillCriswell> I just noticed something... why does saying "work like a charm" mean something works well?
[11:33:25] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, the element on the left has a value smaller than the element on the right. With those params, the one of the left is "a"
[11:33:40] <BillCriswell> I'm thinking of charm as like a good luck charm.
[11:36:18] <Colonel_Panic> so capital "A" and "B" represent the TD contents prior to sorting, and small "a" and "b" represent the TD contents after sorting?
[11:38:45] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, inside the sort callback?
[11:38:50] <Colonel_Panic> yes
[11:39:48] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, the answer is: no
[11:40:18] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, "A" and "B" are just strings that are going to be used for the comparison itself
[11:40:22] <Colonel_Panic> The function iterates through rows looking at the contents of the indexed column...
[11:40:30] <BillCriswell> Sal: You probably want .eq
[11:40:34] <Colonel_Panic> comparing A with B, correct?
[11:40:47] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, right
[11:40:49] <BillCriswell> Sal: Do you want the second to last?
[11:40:53] <Sal> Bill, whats that for?
[11:41:07] <Sal> bill, yes
[11:41:09] <BillCriswell> It's got getting an element.
[11:41:21] <BillCriswell> Sal: You can do rows.eq(-2)
[11:41:44] <Colonel_Panic> so if A is larger than B, it does what?
[11:42:03] <Sal> Bill, is there a way to do it inside a query?
[11:42:12] <BillCriswell> Sal: That is jQuery.
[11:42:26] <BillCriswell> $('tr').eq(-2) will grab the second to last row.
[11:42:28] <Sal> $('.row).eu(-2).appen(myHtml)
[11:42:30] <Sal> like that?
[11:42:41] <Sal> ok, thanks
[11:42:44] <BillCriswell> Sal: That would add content INSIDE the second to last row.
[11:42:52] <BillCriswell> Sal: You probably want it after it, right?
[11:43:06] <Sal> yes
[11:43:10] <Sal> an append after it
[11:43:19] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, That's not well specified. It's a sorting algorithm. The actual algorithm can vary with a different browser
[11:43:20] <BillCriswell> Sal: So use .after() instead of .append()
[11:43:34] <Sal> omg, still have to learn a lot then
[11:43:35] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, you can trust, though, that it will sort it properly
[11:43:36] <Sal> thanks
[11:43:42] <BillCriswell> Sal: No problem.
[11:43:57] <BillCriswell> append and prepend are inside, before and after are outside..
[11:44:04] <BillCriswell> I need a kitkat
[11:44:07] <BillCriswell> BRB.
[11:44:26] <Colonel_Panic> Um, OK
[11:45:04] <Sal> no, its append
[11:45:07] <Sal> i need it inside
[11:45:19] <Sal> after puts it outside at the4 same level of .row
[11:50:54] <BillCriswell> Oh ok.
[11:53:13] <Sal> BillCriswell, do you know any plugin or other lib tha can stick on top pof screen , under the navigation bar, all the group header divs that scroll up under the navigation bar?
[11:53:35] <Sal> i only found pluginsthat wor with 1 div sticking
[11:54:21] <BillCriswell> Sal: Hard time following that. Like sticky table headers or kind of like the contacts list in iOS does?
[11:54:52] <BillCriswell> Sal: http://brianhadaway.github.io/iOSList/ This kinda?
[11:54:52] <Sal> i needyes, just like that
[11:55:54] <Sal> yes, i saw that, but the difference is that the sample uses the same container
[11:56:20] <BillCriswell> Not sure I follow.
[11:56:23] <Sal> i have headers in a container and a navigation bar that is in its own div a larger than the scrolling container
[11:56:41] <MikeD_> that ioslist example:  what is the point of that?
[11:57:04] <Sal> its a damn thing :(
[11:58:20] <MikeD_> i also feel like that would have been better marked up as dl  using the <dt> as the header and the <dd> in place of so many ul/li
[12:17:25] <duch_kazatel> i love sass sometimes.
[12:21:36] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: libsass or die
[12:21:37] <MikeD_> i read that missing the first S
[12:22:28] <duch_kazatel> gg #jquery
[12:22:47] <BillCriswell> gl hf
[12:29:53] <MikeD_> how do i delegate event handling to immediate descendants only?  .on('event','> section', thefunc ); ?
[12:31:46] <duch_kazatel> that's still going to trigger on the bubbled event from the child elements though.
[12:31:47] <duch_kazatel> hrm.
[12:34:25] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/TcrVL/
[12:37:45] <MikeD_> right, how is that different than .on('click', 'p', function(e) {   ?
[12:37:56] <duch_kazatel> click on the span.
[12:38:15] <duch_kazatel> oh woah.
[12:38:25] <duch_kazatel> i'
[12:38:29] <duch_kazatel> *i'm derpingtons today.
[12:38:44] <drej> its monday, most poeple are
[12:38:52] <MikeD_> nice to meet you, we might be related
[12:38:52] <duch_kazatel> i didn't get a chance to relax today.
[12:38:56] <duch_kazatel> err, this past weekend.
[12:39:08] <MikeD_> is "relax" some kinda code ?
[12:39:24] <duch_kazatel> "relax" is code for "not doing shit"
[12:39:42] <duch_kazatel> i've been going nonstop for a bit.  way tired today.
[12:39:52] <MikeD_> are you at work?
[12:39:57] <duch_kazatel> today yeah.
[12:45:30] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, are you done with that snippet?
[12:45:47] <Colonel_Panic> I think so
[12:46:32] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, ok, in that case, it's my turn
[12:48:09] <Colonel_Panic> OK
[12:48:55] <roxlu> hi! How can I can get the same width that the inspector in chrome shows me in the top right corner with jquery? (window.outerWidth() returns me a different value)
[12:53:27] <roxlu> e.g. window.outerWidth returns something else then $(window).outerwidth()
[12:53:59] <brunoais> roxlu, that's because they are different hings
[12:54:18] <roxlu> lol makes sense : )
[12:54:20] <brunoais> I don't really remember what jQuery's outerwidth is
[12:54:30] <brunoais> specially related to window
[12:54:52] <Whiskey> http://jsfiddle.net/Slaktarn/q5D8E/ How do i get that to work whit leapyears the timer script
[12:55:01] <BillCriswell> window.innerWidth seems to work for me.
[12:55:14] <roxlu> ok, brunoais I guess I'll just use window.outerWidth as that's the width I want to have.
[12:58:05] <Whiskey> hate leap yeats
[13:00:11] <MikeD_> then don't leap yeats
[13:00:48] <Whiskey> MikeD_: If i don´t it will count wrong
[13:01:44] <dkris> Day 1 with jQuery. I wrote this piece of code. $(".friend).bind("mouseenter",friendFunction);. I have been asked to refactor this to use delegated event handling such that the event will be triggered on new elements added to page after initial page load.
[13:02:04] <dkris> What part of the documentation should i refer to? Any pointers?
[13:02:04] <duch_kazatel> dkris which version of jquery are you using?
[13:02:28] <duch_kazatel> dkris if anything remotely recent, look at the documentation for .on() - the key word you're concerned with is "delegation"
[13:02:33] <dkris> duch_kazatel 1.7
[13:06:07] <dkris> duch_kazatel So you're suggesting I do this instead. $(".friend).on("mouseenter",friendFunction);
[13:06:23] <duch_kazatel> instead of .bind(), yes.
[13:06:27] <dkris> Understood that from the documentation
[13:06:32] <duch_kazatel> but that's not the delegated syntax.
[13:09:34] <mylord> how do i get this element? <span itemprop="productID">756420966715</span>
[13:09:37] <mylord> the number
[13:10:18] <BillCriswell> mylord: What have you tried?
[13:13:56] <mylord> BillCriswell: I’ve tried this: var upc = $("#productID");
[13:14:08] <mylord> here’s the page: http://www.carters.com/carters-kid-girl-shoes/V_CS14-FLIP-G01.html?navid=carters-xsellPDPYMAL
[13:14:10] <dkris> duch_kazel. How about $(document).on({     mouseenter: friendFunction }, '.foo');
[13:14:19] <BillCriswell> mylord: Ok. That would only be for selecting based on an id.
[13:14:28] <BillCriswell> mylord: You're want to look at attribute selectors.
[13:15:07] <BillCriswell> $('span[itemprop=productID]').text() would give you that number.
[13:15:11] <mylord> BrillCriswell: I’m trying to get the number under the name, right of where it says “Style #”. This number changes though, after you select a size. Can you suggest something?
[13:15:15] <mylord> thanks!
[13:15:24] <decx> add a class, eventhough schema tags are a grey area it's not guaranteed that itemprop will be returned right
[13:15:41] <dkris> That way the event gets triggered on new elements added to to the page after initial page load
[13:16:10] <dkris> duch_kazael: That way the event gets triggered on new elements added to to the page after initial page load.
[13:17:40] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, I'd do more like this: http://jsfiddle.net/brunoais/VgCZL/59/
[13:17:47] <brunoais> I didn't use much jQuery
[13:17:57] <gnarf> BillCriswell: i think you are requred to have quotes around that productID
[13:18:14] <dkris> duch_kazatel: from $(".friend").bind('mouseenter', func); to $(document).on({mouseenter: func }, '.friend'); That way the event gets triggered on new elements added to to the page after initial page load.
[13:18:32] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, but I think that's mostely due to my lower level thinking. Do you understand it?
[13:18:43] <brunoais> I'll be back in 1h or 2
[13:18:56] <dkris> duch_kazatel: is this a better approach
[13:19:35] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, I could do it even more generalistic but I went more into a more balanced way
[13:19:38] <brunoais> brb
[13:19:40] <Colonel_Panic> Hmmm
[13:19:42] <mylord> BillCriswell: any idea why alert is showing upc as empty. The following code in my google chrome extension, which runs when I click after page load: http://hastebin.com/sopuyotepe.coffee
[13:19:43] <Colonel_Panic> Looking at it now
[13:21:52] <BillCriswell> mylord: Not sure, looks fine here: http://jsbin.com/nases/1/edit?html,js,output
[13:23:29] <mylord> BillCriswell: since this is a google extension, I still haven’t worked out how to check for sure that jquery is working.. though I do have a working $.post, so I guess it should.. that’s all I can think of..
[13:23:57] <Azrael_-> hi
[13:26:08] <BillCriswell> mylord: Are you sure you mean to be looking for [itemprop=productID] ?
[13:26:16] <Azrael_-> i'm using the jquery validation plugin and use the css-class "number" for validation the input-data. but i need it to allow not only 0.5 but also 0,5 for the german number format. how can i do this?
[13:26:36] <dkris> I wrote this piece of code. $(".friend).bind("mouseenter",friendFunction);. I have been asked to refactor this to use delegated event handling such that the event will be triggered on new elements added to page after initial page load.
[13:26:49] <BillCriswell> dkris: Right.
[13:26:55] <dkris> I changed it to (document).on({mouseenter: func }, '.friend');
[13:27:06] <BillCriswell> dkris: Okie doke.
[13:27:22] <mylord> BillCriswell: I want that string right under the name, where it says Style #: http://www.carters.com/carters-kid-girl-shoes/V_CS14-FLIP-G01.html?navid=carters-xsellPDPYMAL
[13:27:39] <mylord> When you click the sizes (S,M,L,XL) the string changes.
[13:28:25] <MikeD_> dkris: delegated registration is  parent.on( 'event', 'childselector', handler );
[13:28:33] <KLVTZ> Getting a 405 exception for method not allowed. I'm using a PATCH request and all approproate entity is changed. Anyway to get rid of this exception? setting i need to change?
[13:28:36] <BillCriswell> mylord: $('[itemprop=productID]').text() in the console works there.
[13:29:00] <BillCriswell> dkris: Is there more to the story? =)
[13:29:10] <dkris> MikedD_: Thank you. I will look into the documentation for .on()
[13:29:28] <BillCriswell> dkris: What you have is using event delegation.
[13:29:50] <Velveeta> billcriswell: his arguments were backwards though
[13:29:55] <Velveeta> which i think is what miked_ was pointing out
[13:30:17] <BillCriswell> What it's changes to looks right to me?
[13:30:39] <BillCriswell> changed*
[13:31:28] <MikeD_> i think he's expressing the request poorly
[13:31:40] <BillCriswell> http://jsbin.com/nases/2/edit?js
[13:31:44] <BillCriswell> MikeD_: Ah, got ya
[13:31:52] <Velveeta> oh actually, i'm not sure what the format is when you're specifying your events in an object format
[13:32:12] <BillCriswell> Velveeta: That link I posted is using that way.
[13:32:50] <Velveeta> rightio
[13:32:58] <dkris> MikeD_: Having a hard time putting it across. Day 1 with jQuery. Will get better though
[13:33:33] <MikeD_> dkris:  fortunately the docs for jquery are good
[13:34:09] <MikeD_> you do understand the purpose of changing your code to use delegation, right?
[13:34:59] <dkris> MikeD_:Yes. To make sure that the event is triggered for any new elements that get added later on.
[13:35:17] <Whiskey> MikeD_: You never answerd me
[13:36:00] <MikeD_> Whiskey: what was your question?
[13:37:16] <dkris> MikeD_: so (document).on({mouseenter: func }, '.friend');  is better written as  (document).on( 'mouseenter', '.friend', func );
[13:38:06] <rindolf> dkris: not $(document)?
[13:39:14] <mylord> BillCriswell: since this is javascript in a chrome extension, maybe I first have to get at the HTML (as in var html = document.body.outerHTML)? In that case, how do I call this on html? html.$('span[itemprop=productID]').text(); //?
[13:39:15] <Whiskey> MikeD_: http://jsfiddle.net/Slaktarn/q5D8E/ How do i get that to work whit leapyears the timer script
[13:39:23] <Whiskey> You told me to don´t do leap years, then i told else it will count wrong
[13:39:36] <MikeD_> better is subjective.  using the object notation you could assign multiple handlers to the same selector.  It looks a little weird since I've been using the 3 parameter .on()
[13:40:02] <BillCriswell> mylord: I'm not familiar with that part of things.
[13:40:33] <MikeD_> oh, heh,  you said "hate leap yeats"  and i suggested you not try to jump over yeats ... but lemme loop
[13:40:35] <MikeD_> look
[13:41:03] <dkris> MikeD_: I believe a lot more handlers will get added later on.
[13:41:53] <Whiskey> i mean it can´t be hard to find out how many days a month have
[13:42:53] <MikeD_> how accurate do you need to be?  are you worried about leap seconds that get added too?
[13:43:03] <MikeD_> are you caring about daylight savings?
[13:43:20] <decx> it's going to be y2k all over again
[13:43:33] <Whiskey> no no
[13:43:41] <Whiskey> nothing like that just the the days in month get correct
[13:43:57] <Whiskey> like 28/29/30/31
[13:44:19] <MikeD_> take the first of the following month and subtract one day
[13:46:08] <Whiskey> MileD_: The reason that i ask is that im such on JS i have not wrote the script i have i have only modify it a bit after my needs
[13:46:36] <Whiskey> and have taught me a lot but this is above my knowledge
[13:49:40] <BillCriswell> Whiskey: Are you using moment?
[13:50:22] <Whiskey> BillCriswell: No i don´t you mean MomentJS?
[13:50:28] <BillCriswell> Yes.
[13:50:35] <Whiskey> Have you look at my code?
[13:50:43] <BillCriswell> Nope.
[13:50:59] <Whiskey> MomentJS don´t show every second as my one does thats the problem whit MomentJS
[13:52:05] <Whiskey> atlest not that i found out how to do, try some month ago to play whit it
[13:52:13] <BillCriswell> Ok.
[13:52:36] <Whiskey> my script can shows like "13y 3m 1w 2d 8h 33m 29s ago"
[13:52:36] <Colonel_Panic> brunoais: there appears to be something wrong with the sorting algorithm...
[13:52:55] <Whiskey> while moment only shows a bit of it and don´t count whole time
[13:52:59] <Colonel_Panic> It sorts some rows in ascending order and some in descending order
[13:54:09] <Whiskey> but still add it should be easy if you know how to do it correct
[13:54:46] <BillCriswell> Got ya.
[13:55:07] <Colonel_Panic> The Annual Limit field seems to sort in ascending order except for the lowest figure, which it inexplicably places at the bottom
[13:58:41] <Whiskey> :P
[14:07:53] <Hyperking> please help, this is simple yet Im at my wits end as to why this would work
[14:07:57] <Hyperking> http://jsfiddle.net/mCuWS/15/
[14:09:09] <Hyperking> How do we grab each element with "data-datedata"  attribute and place its value inside the console element?
[14:10:21] <Hyperking> 18hrs of frustration. we are new to jquery and about to throw in the towel
[14:11:14] <decx> attr only returns the first
[14:11:52] <MikeD_> Hyperking: you waited too long to ask for help, it's not that difficult.  :)
[14:13:43] <MikeD_> Hyperking: all of those li have datedata on them, isn't that the same as selecting the li?
[14:17:49] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, that's because it is sorting as a string, not a number
[14:18:02] <decx> what all that code to put the dates in the div??
[14:18:15] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, if you want the oportunity to sort as a number, you have to convert it to a number before comparing
[14:19:41] <MikeD_> Hyperking: http://jsfiddle.net/mCuWS/16/
[14:20:02] <dwarder> guys, in $(document).ready(function(){
[14:20:10] <dwarder> i define a var
[14:20:17] <dwarder> i.e. var myvar=1;
[14:20:36] <dwarder> then i use this
[14:20:37] <dwarder>     var requestAnimFrame = window.requestAnimationFrame || window.mozRequestAnimationFrame ||

[14:21:05] <dwarder> that myvar is undefined \
[14:21:08] <dwarder> why?
[14:21:41] <Hyperking> MikeD_:yes, what is .data??
[14:21:45] <MikeD_> dwarder: "var" should give you a hint... the variable is scoped to the function you created it in.
[14:22:11] <dwarder> MikeD_: var myvar is created in $(document).ready(function(){
[14:22:18] <MikeD_> Hyperking: it's a collection of data-* attributes.  it looks nicer than attr('data-datedata')
[14:22:23] <dwarder> MikeD_: it is scoped to $(document).ready(function(){
[14:22:26] <dwarder> MikeD_: ?
[14:22:37] <decx> Hyperking http://jsfiddle.net/decx/mCuWS/17/
[14:23:17] <Hyperking> slow down decx: what is push?? im new
[14:23:44] <dwarder> MikeD_: i put var myvar out of $(document).ready(function(){ but i still have the same error
[14:24:07] <Hyperking> MikeD_:I will look that method up..so .data is like .text?
[14:24:08] <decx> Hyperking we create an array to hold our date strings, for every .col5 in .eventlist we push one string with the data into the array, after that the whole array is attached to .console
[14:24:10] <Colonel_Panic> brunoais: how do you convert it to a number?
[14:24:10] <MikeD_> requestAnimationFrame(update);  is 'update' a function or a variable?
[14:24:22] <dwarder> MikeD_: update is a function
[14:24:36] <dwarder> MikeD_: inside it i try to reach myvar
[14:24:54] <Colonel_Panic> I think it needs to recognize the difference between an alphabetic string and a number
[14:24:58] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, parseInt()
[14:25:08] <Colonel_Panic> Ah I see
[14:25:30] <Hyperking> decx:i will need to look into .push and .data since those where things we missed
[14:25:51] <decx> push isn't related to jquery
[14:26:02] <decx> it's just a way to push items in an array
[14:26:22] <dwarder> MikeD_: maybe this whole  requestAnimationFrame(update); works in special way about var scropes?
[14:26:23] <Hyperking> what?? so how can you use it
[14:26:33] <Hyperking> is push javascript?
[14:26:51] <decx> it's a native function yes
[14:26:53] <rofel> Hi, I am using jquery ui 'resizable' to allow resizing of a div. When I resize the div and the browser is changed in size the media queries for that div - which change its size - do not come into effect. Is there anything I can do about this?
[14:26:53] <MikeD_> dwarder: it sounds like you might be looking for something called a closure, but I'm not fluent enough to explain that
[14:27:41] <Hyperking> ok mind blown! need a break...thanks a bunch
[14:28:24] <MikeD_> decx:  why the array?
[14:28:41] <MikeD_> is that just to minimize the amount of repaint?
[14:28:56] <decx> yes
[14:30:05] <Hyperking> one last question.. MikeD_: is idx, el arbitrary or neccesary?
[14:30:15] <MikeD_> arbitrary
[14:30:25] <MikeD_> index, element
[14:30:51] <Hyperking> yes. decx did use them in his solution
[14:31:03] <MikeD_> "e" is too easily confused with "event" and "error" so i disambiguate - with as few letters as possible :)
[14:31:08] <Hyperking> trying to make logic out of your solutions
[14:31:37] <Sal> can someone please help me with this: http://jsfiddle.net/LpnvB/
[14:31:41] <MikeD_> index() is a function, so i wouldn't want to see that as a variable name
[14:32:05] <Sal> need to fix under the navigation bar, the 2 grey heares (header 1 and header 2 lines)
[14:32:14] <Sal> when scrolling up
[14:32:20] <Sal> i can't find a way to do it
[14:32:55] <Sal> i saw many sticking plugins, but they all work for only one div and also, with the same container as the scrolling part
[14:34:22] <Sal> MikeD_ it was me that asked for the ioslist example
[14:35:07] <Sal> i'm trying to apply it, but can't make it because of the different containers (navbar and scrollable)
[14:35:53] <MikeD_> Sal: no idea.
[14:58:00] <duch_kazatel> Sal you want position: fixed; after the page has scrolled enough.
[14:58:16] <duch_kazatel> i think.
[14:58:53] <Sal> as soon as they go under the navigation bar
[14:59:06] <Sal> they are group headers
[14:59:29] <Sal> and i need then to stay on screen , under the navigation bar, until the next group header comes up
[14:59:35] <Sal> and so on for all others
[14:59:58] <Sal> then, when you scroll back, they should get restored where they were
[15:03:37] <decx> there http://jsfiddle.net/decx/63h8f/ no guarantees for not doing any illogical crap
[15:06:11] <Sal> decx, thanks, but i have problems applying it (like all others that i have found) to my html
[15:06:29] <Sal> because i have a fixed top navigation bar
[15:07:20] <Sal> and width of group headers is inside a 960px width container while the navbar is 100%
[15:07:50] <decx> that's just how fixed works
[15:08:33] <Sal> i know, i saw many samples like that
[15:08:49] <Sal> they all fix divs that are in the same container
[15:08:51] <decx> what you do is get the parent width and apply that to your sticky div
[15:09:06] <decx> and on sticky remove set width to auto again
[15:09:18] <Sal> can you try to apply it to my sample?
[15:09:23] <Sal> i'm not able
[15:09:44] <Sal> oh, wait.....
[15:09:59] <Sal> you're saying that i don't need to move the header from one container to another?
[15:10:16] <Sal> that i just need to stop it and change its width?
[15:10:35] <Sal> but wont that change the width of the containing div too?
[15:10:46] <Sal> and so, all the other divs in it
[15:13:33] <decx> i just hacked it in there now http://jsfiddle.net/decx/63h8f/1/
[15:14:55] <Sal> i thank you so much for your help, but i'm still far away from my sample
[15:16:27] <decx> good good... next fix starts at 100€/h consulting fees
[15:16:32] <Sal> look at my code: http://jsfiddle.net/LpnvB/
[15:18:53] <Azrael_-> i'm using the jquery validation plugin and use the css-class "number" for validation the input-data. but i need it to allow not only 0.5 but also 0,5 for the german number format. how can i do this?

[15:26:10] <PheLe> Hi all. Does anyone know a image slideshow plugin that allows me to change interval of each slide?
[15:41:31] <guzzlefry> Is there a method to check for an empty element?
[15:42:14] <guzzlefry> oh... :empty might work
[16:03:07] <guzzlefry> Is there a way to stop the Jquery-ui dialog from destroying the elements it displays?
[16:04:47] <__joshua__> on close?
[16:05:04] <guzzlefry> yes
[16:05:21] <__joshua__> option 1: get close event, detach contents
[16:06:06] <__joshua__> hmmm, destroy:"Removes the dialog functionality completely. This will return the element back to its pre-init state."
[16:07:39] <__joshua__> if you append your element to the dom before calling dialog, destroy will leave it there
[16:12:45] <guzzlefry> looks like the appendTo option might work, but this framework is running an ancient version of jQuery UI :/
[16:51:49] <Sal> can someone tell me what does this do: $.fn.myfunc = function () {...}
[16:52:07] <duch_kazatel> that makes a new jquery method
[16:52:47] <duch_kazatel> Sal
[16:53:59] <Sal> so, when i attach it to a class like this $('myclass').myfunc()
[16:54:08] <Sal> what does it do?
[16:54:23] <duch_kazatel> runs it against the returned results.
[16:54:28] <duch_kazatel> or whatever else you're doing with it.
[16:55:15] <Sal> ok, so is that the correct way to add some js code directly to an element?
[16:55:29] <duch_kazatel> i have no idea what you're doing, so i cannot answer that question.
[16:55:37] <duch_kazatel> define "add some js code directly to an element"
[16:56:14] <Sal> for example, handling events directly in the element
[16:56:30] <Sal> instead of handling window methods and then search for the element
[16:56:42] <duch_kazatel> "handling events directly in the element" doesn't make sense.  are you trying to setup event listeners?
[16:57:06] <Sal> no, never mind... i just wanted to know what could that method creating be good for
[16:57:14] <duch_kazatel> plugins, basically.
[16:57:14] <Sal> because i have never used it since now
[16:57:40] <duch_kazatel> don't extend the jquery object unless you really need to.
[16:57:48] <Sal> oh
[16:58:00] <Sal> look at this please: http://jsfiddle.net/LpnvB/
[16:58:09] <duch_kazatel> adding methods and properties can be a good thing sometimes, but not unless you know what you're doing.
[16:58:12] <duch_kazatel> what are you trying to do here.
[16:58:14] <Sal> the jquery code is by decx
[16:58:30] <Sal> i inserted it inside my html and it seems to work
[16:58:46] <Sal> but, is there a way to change it so it doesn't get inserted as a method?
[16:59:03] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[16:59:06] <duch_kazatel> which part?
[16:59:20] <Sal> $('.groupHeader').fixednav()
[16:59:35] <duch_kazatel> i don't see that.
[16:59:48] <Sal> http://jsfiddle.net/LpnvB/1/
[16:59:53] <Sal> sorry, had to update
[16:59:55] <duch_kazatel> there we go.
[17:00:27] <Sal> also, can you give me a help to let the second header see on top of the first
[17:00:39] <duch_kazatel> hold up - one thing at a time.
[17:00:39] <Sal> i was trying to increment z-index
[17:00:46] <Sal> ok, thanks
[17:02:09] <duch_kazatel> okay, so what is your first question, specifically?
[17:03:10] <Sal> you said to avoid using methods if not really needed
[17:03:22] <Sal> and in that sample, there is a use of it
[17:03:32] <duch_kazatel> this seems like a decent use case for them.
[17:03:51] <Sal> because there is an event listener? right?
[17:03:56] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[17:04:17] <Sal>     if (scrollY >= offset) {
[17:04:19] <duch_kazatel> the event listener isn't the reason this seems decent.
[17:04:23] <duch_kazatel> that's not a listener.
[17:04:27] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: There's an advertisement on facebook for me for riot.js
[17:04:35] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell good :)
[17:04:39] <Sal> w.on(scroll
[17:04:41] <duch_kazatel> i see it too.
[17:04:46] <duch_kazatel> Sal what are you asking?
[17:05:20] <Sal> how can i let the second header sroll on top of the first before its stuck?
[17:05:41] <duch_kazatel> "scroll on top of the firt before its stuck" - not understanding what you want.
[17:05:55] <Sal> if you check, it goes under and only when it reaches the top-n position, it jumps in front
[17:06:07] <duch_kazatel> set its z-index higher via css.
[17:06:11] <Sal> header 2
[17:06:33] <Sal> i tried to, but the z-index setting goes to header 1 also
[17:06:53] <duch_kazatel> is this something you're going to be using a lot?
[17:07:07] <Sal> yes
[17:07:37] <duch_kazatel> oh you're all ready using inline styles.
[17:07:46] <duch_kazatel> z-index: 9999; on that particular one.
[17:08:16] <Sal> as yous ee in the js code, i was using a z-Idx var to keep a high value that i wanted to increase on every header
[17:08:29] <Sal> but it didn't work
[17:08:46] <duch_kazatel> okay.  you find if I add a class each header?
[17:09:03] <duch_kazatel> *fine
[17:09:22] <duch_kazatel> or will these headers all share a particular class as-is?
[17:10:45] <duch_kazatel> sal
[17:11:07] <Sal> http://jsfiddle.net/LpnvB/2/
[17:11:15] <Sal> this is the try
[17:11:27] <duch_kazatel> can you answer my question please?
[17:11:39] <Sal> i set all the same class, stick
[17:11:48] <Sal> and then add some css code also
[17:11:54] <Sal> with jquery
[17:11:55] <duch_kazatel> you'
[17:12:02] <duch_kazatel> *you're doing that part all wrong.
[17:12:08] <Sal> oh
[17:12:26] <duch_kazatel> i don't see the class "stick" on them - where is it?
[17:12:42] <Sal> sticky, sorry
[17:12:45] <Sal> its in css
[17:12:51] <duch_kazatel> in your HTML.
[17:12:53] <Sal> self.addClass('sticky')
[17:12:53] <duch_kazatel> not css.
[17:13:02] <Sal> line 16
[17:13:45] <duch_kazatel> html.  not js.
[17:13:50] <duch_kazatel> i don't care about the sticky part.
[17:13:51] <duch_kazatel> ignore that.
[17:14:30] <duch_kazatel> nevermind i'll just do it the other way.
[17:14:49] <Sal> its working, look : http://goo.gl/ZvNh9y
[17:14:58] <Sal> i mean, its adding it to the div
[17:15:04] <Sal> but not working on screen
[17:15:05] <duch_kazatel> you are recalculating things on every scroll, which is a bad idea.
[17:15:13] <Sal> oh
[17:17:02] <duch_kazatel> you want to set the z-index before scroll, basically.
[17:18:41] <duch_kazatel> something like this: http://jsfiddle.net/LpnvB/3/
[17:18:54] <duch_kazatel> and actually, name things better; http://jsfiddle.net/LpnvB/4/

[17:27:44] <duch_kazatel> use a class selector instead.
[17:27:51] <Sal> duch_kazatel, whats happening? why is the col1 col2 text going over the headers?
[17:27:57] <duch_kazatel> $("#pp_now") -> $(".pp_now")
[17:28:01] <duch_kazatel> Sal hrm?
[17:28:13] <RNT> i tied almost all possible combinations :(

[17:29:12] <RNT> thank you duch_kazatel, it seems its fine now
[17:29:20] <Sal> now the second and others go over the previous
[17:29:32] <duch_kazatel> sal ah i see what you mean.
[17:29:50] <duch_kazatel> why are you nesting so many divs for the header?
[17:30:00] <Sal> duch_kazatel, never mind, let me try to finx it
[17:30:32] <Sal> yes i know, i need to simplfy it a little bit
[17:30:38] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: Seems ok here in Firefox?
[17:30:57] <Sal> but first let me get it to work, then i'll change some css and take away some nested divs and use html tags

[21:56:42] <jphase> you just need to write a recursive function that grabs the files in a directory, grabs the directories in that directory and calls itself on each of those directories
[21:56:50] <jphase> depends on how you need it really

[23:04:36] <gr34d> how do I get it so that whenever a select box item changes, the corresponding checkbox is checked
[23:04:54] <rindolf> gr34d: use a loop.
[23:05:01] <Whiskey> yeh i fixed that jphase
[23:05:04] <rindolf> gr34d: with a closure and a regex match.
[23:05:23] <rindolf> gr34d: are you familiar with regular expressions?
[23:05:28] <gr34d> how do I do that? no I am not
[23:06:27] <rindolf> gr34d: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions?redirectlocale=en-US&redirectslug=JavaScript%2FGuide%2FRegular_Expressions - see this.
[23:07:01] <gr34d> so you reckon programatically determine the id at the end?
[23:07:54] <gr34d> if I use: $('select').on('change', function() { ...
[23:08:03] <gr34d> how can I get the ID of the select item which was changed?
[23:08:09] <gr34d> select element rather
[23:09:07] <rindolf> gr34d: you should receive it as an argument.
[23:09:38] <gr34d> it must be possible using "this"?
[23:09:53] <gr34d> $('select').on('change', function() { .... ie. if I use "this.value" here, I'd get the value from the dropdown
[23:10:02] <gr34d> what do I need to do to get the id of the element though?
[23:10:32] <jphase> gr34d: $(this).attr('id')
[23:11:05] <gr34d> thanks
[23:12:13] <rindolf> jphase++
[23:14:49] <gr34d> instead of regex, is there a function that will just strip all but numerals?
[23:14:50] <zylophone> how can i compare two objects together to see if they have the same properties (where the object needs to recurse)
[23:14:56] <zylophone> maybe some sort of hashing function?
[23:15:06] <jphase> gr34d: regex would probably be best for that actually
[23:15:53] <jphase> zylophone: by compare do you mean get all different properties or just combine the two?
[23:16:00] <jphase> sounds similar to using $.extend
[23:17:12] <zylophone> jphase: i just want to know if they're different or the same, i'm not fussed what elements are different
[23:17:54] <zylophone> uhm, i mean property values, not just property names!
[23:19:37] <jphase> zylophone: http://jsfiddle.net/jphase/q5D8E/2/
[23:19:57] <jphase> returns false when there are no differences, otherwise returns an object of the differences
[23:21:31] <zylophone> jphase: wow, thanks
[23:21:45] <jphase> np
[23:22:25] <zylophone> i was expecting some nice jquery function to check that ;)
[23:27:58] <ElisaCT> excuse me guys
[23:28:01] <ElisaCT> I have          $('#horizontal').delegate('a', 'click', function() {         	window.location.hash = $(this).attr('href');         	event.preventDefault();         });
[23:28:09] <ElisaCT> and is somewhat messing with my link acctions
[23:28:21] <ElisaCT> I have some addClass on click and its messing with that
[23:28:24] <ElisaCT> any ideas what can I do?
[23:29:40] <gr34d> thanks guys
[23:29:42] <gr34d> that worked
[23:29:49] <gr34d> (regex)
[23:33:36] <jphase> ElisaCT: my first question would by why you'd have that function to begin with since that's already the natural behavior of an anchor tag, and the second question I'd have would be how exactly is it messing with your other event handler
[23:34:05] <jphase> by = be
[23:34:49] <dopie> hey all
[23:34:57] <jphase> hello
[23:35:08] <dopie> Can someone help me on why my modal window is not opening
[23:35:09] <dopie> http://gwhite.staycreativedesign.com/users/sign_up
[23:35:19] <dopie> http://gwhite.staycreativedesign.com/js/modal.js
[23:36:31] <dopie> There is no error message
[23:36:33] <dopie> or anything
[23:36:33] <jphase> dopie: where are you calling .modal?
[23:37:03] <dopie> jphase, on ACCEPT terms
[23:37:05] <dopie> in the bottom
[23:39:31] <dopie> jphase, im not sure what im doing wrong
[23:42:05] <Uhkis> you're not calling $(yourbutton).modal(); anywhere
[23:43:19] <Uhkis> oh, there's autoloading
[23:45:11] <dopie> Uhkis, should i call that instead
[23:45:20] <dopie> instead of doing autoloading?
[23:46:16] <jphase> odd
[23:46:31] <jphase> well even in the console if I don't bind to the document and bind to the element itself it works
[23:49:41] <jphase> dopie: but yeah, typically you'd want to bind the prototype in the document itself and allow the end-user to use something like $(document).modal() to search for modal:open attribute values, or specifically $('.somemodal').modal();
[23:50:00] <dopie> jphase, can you gist or fiddle it please??
[23:50:03] <dopie> im noob status on jquery
[23:50:13] <jphase> dopie: is this your modal plugin?
[23:50:41] <Uhkis> yeah this worked fine: jQuery('.register-btn').click(function() { jQuery('#ex1').modal(); });
[23:50:51] <dopie> jphase, no
[23:50:59] <dopie> http://kylefox.ca/jquery-modal/examples/index.html
[23:51:21] <jphase> dopie: any reason you're using this one in particular?
[23:51:33] <dopie> first thing google came up
[23:51:39] <dopie> do you suggest another one?
[23:52:18] <jphase> if I just need a simple modal library I usually use colorbox
[23:52:31] <jphase> it gives you some functionality for galleries and video as well
[23:56:04] <dopie> Uhkis, so how do i call that???
[23:56:12] <dopie> i tried putting script over what you did and i failed
[23:59:31] <Findegil> Morning
