[00:53:17] <shebbi>  How to uppercase first character in a string?
[00:53:23] <shebbi> is there jQuery for that?
[01:07:01] <shebbi> When you load content into a jQuery Dialog, it hides it in the Dialog, When you close the Dialog, it stays hidden. HOw to make it show again? I thought when you close the dialog box it would automatically show the content again, but it doesn't. odd behaviour.
[01:32:48] <Grundell> How do i add data-toggle="modal" to all my <a> links ?
[01:39:31] <shoky2> $('a').each(function() { $(this).data('toggle', 'modal'); });
[01:39:37] <shoky2> In response to Grundell
[01:40:19] <shebbi> how to get first element in $foo?
[01:40:35] <shebbi> $foo('first'); doesn't work
[01:42:36] <shoky2> $foo.first()
[01:43:17] <shebbi> yep that worked, thanks
[01:43:52] <shoky2> serbs lead the way
[01:43:54] <shoky2> ;)
[01:44:25] <emx> i can't connect to jqueryui.com. is there a mirror?
[01:46:20] <shebbi> shoky2: I have a jquery dialog. How do I pass the registered events in content to the dialog, as the events no longer fire.
[01:47:07] <shebbi> $myDialog($content).dialog('open');
[01:47:10] <shoky2> $('body').on('click', 'a.myClass', function(e) { alert('Here you go.'); });
[01:47:15] <shoky2> delegated events
[01:47:32] <shebbi> $content already has registered events on them
[01:47:49] <shebbi> They no longer work when passed to dialog
[01:48:07] <shoky2> do as I told you
[01:49:17] <shebbi> Right the Dialog must move the $content around or wrap it in some element?
[01:52:08] <shebbi> Fixed, thanks again.
[01:56:18] <shebbi> in delegated, does $(this) refer to 'body' or 'a.myClass'?
[03:16:00] <Grundell> shoky: sorry went afk... Thanks1
[04:04:19] <enelar> Guys, i have several companies that represent current market top(sorted by cheapest price). Every day random. I want make this css selector: when i hover one company, mark every price in table they offer. For goal this, i want encode company name to safe string (like base64 idk), and use it in selector
[04:04:38] <enelar> Here the question. How i should encode random string, to get valid random class name?
[04:05:40] <enelar> I mean $('.company01').css('background-color', 'red'); <- works well, but -> $('.company #02 we the best!!!') not
[05:07:53] <EoN> hello friends.
[05:08:43] <shebbi> Hi, is there a way to position a dialog relative to an element rather than specifying coordinates?
[05:08:58] <shebbi> Hi EoN
[05:11:13] <arschmitz> EoN: also note because you mentioned #jquerymobile-dev SHOULD not work either if it does ping me it should redirect to #jqueryui-dev
[05:11:46] <EoN> yeah it did redirect me there
[05:12:47] <arschmitz> EoN: awesone
[05:12:59] <EoN> :)
[05:26:19] <snufft> hi guys!
[05:26:37] <snufft> not sure if i should be here or in jquery ui, but i'll give this a shot :)
[05:27:24] <snufft> i'm trying to implement this tidy little widget on my site: http://www.jqueryscript.net/form/jQuery-Plugin-To-Turn-Checkboxes-Into-Toggle-Buttons-BlueToggleButton.html . now it's working pretty well so far, but i'm stuck on one small point
[05:28:43] <snufft> i'm trying to set he label property of the widget to be the text of the label elementy that is the next sibling of the checkbox that is being replaced
[05:29:32] <decx> no need for a ui plugin or even ui, it's a simple traversal
[05:29:59] <snufft> if you go to point 6 of that page, there's an example and in the text property, i've tried things like $(this).next("label").text()
[05:34:31] <snufft> decx, it's all the image replacement etc that I was hoping not to rewrite :)
[05:39:30] <KamalKaur> My ajax request isn't working: http://pastie.org/9601648
[05:39:40] <KamalKaur> And the browser console shows nothing
[05:43:37] <KamalKaur> Applied on html: http://pastie.org/9601661
[05:45:29] <shebbi> There are 4 people in #jQuery-UI
[05:45:44] <shebbi> I think your better to ask questions here!
[05:47:51] <decx> snufft not to be judgemental but the plugin is shit, your problem is solved with a bit of css and an .on('change',function(){ mylabel.toggleClass('checked') })
[05:50:51] <snufft> decx, i appreciate your input :) and thank you for you time :) i guess i should stop being lazy and write my own then :P
[05:51:22] <snufft> decx, out of curiosity, can attributes like that 'text' attribute, be set by jquery? or does it have to be a static value?
[05:53:02] <decx> huh?
[05:54:11] <snufft> decx, on here, in step number 6 where the attributes are being set (maybe attributes is the wrong word?), is it possible to set the 'text' attribute using code, or would it always have to be a static value?
[05:54:37] <decx> here's an easy example http://jsfiddle.net/obca5sny/
[05:59:24] <snufft> decx, thank you very much! :D
[06:00:19] <decx> with a bit more css you can add your icons http://jsfiddle.net/obca5sny/1/
[06:04:05] <shebbi> what's wrong with this line of code:
[06:04:06] <shebbi> close: function(){ close_message_dialog( e, $commBox, $msgContactContainer, $messageIcon ); }
[06:06:16] <decx> look at your console
[06:08:53] <shebbi> good tip
[06:10:37] <shebbi> Thanks, fixed!
[06:30:46] <shebbi> Hi, can jQuery be used to get coordinates of an element?
[06:31:40] <decx> .offset()
[06:32:32] <KamalKaur> What can be the possible reason behind an ajax request not working?
[06:40:08] <decx> look at your console
[07:19:11] <definity> any one know know why fadeIn() is not working? http://pastie.org/9600178
[07:25:55] <_wired> hey guys, im messing with some history state plugins but i dont see any which supports something like say, if i have an additional ID to pass into the state. lets take a shopping cart use case, we can have pages like #main, #cart, and perhaps stuff with id like #item/123 or #item/456 etc. im trying to use json to pull it into the individual pages
[07:26:39] <_wired> anyone has any examples or something on how to achieve that? ideally i would need an on change listener when the links are clicked... yes?
[07:27:10] <_wired> but how do i grab the ID then?
[07:50:51] <NBhosting> why does this trow , undifined is not a function at line 37  https://dpaste.de/hG0Z
[07:51:48] <NBhosting> Uncaught TypeError: undefined is not a function (index):337(anonymous function) (index):337j jquery.min.js:2k.fireWith jquery.min.js:2n.extend.ready jquery.min.js:2K
[08:02:10] <NBhosting> anyone?
[08:03:57] <definity> When using JQ Instead of selectors can i just use $(window) as you would in normal java script
[09:29:33] <no_gravity> Any good library out there to make html dropdowns beautiful?
[09:30:13] <unnotused> if i have a select with multiple optgroups is there an easy way to see if the option is wrapped in a specific optgroup?
[09:31:12] <unnotused> would it just be $(this).parent().attr('label') or something like that?
[09:31:21] * unnotused tries it out
[09:33:31] <decx> parent('optgroup').length
[10:08:25] <unnotused> what do you guys use for debugging?
[10:09:07] <unnotused> b/c i Know the line of my error, i know my error is "Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected identifier" i just don't know what it is . . . .
[10:18:30] <shoky> unnotused: there's a syntax error in that line, or near it, most likely. if you pastebin the code we can find it
[10:41:09] <unnotused> shoky, found my error, now i can't figure out how to load an XML file on a wordpress site
[10:50:17] <adv_> i'm using jquery mobile listview in a.php and i want to pass data like $foo to b.php once a <li> is pressed. how can i do this?
[11:04:59] <Forbidd3n> Is is possible to create an anchor tag with jquery and trigger a click like this? var a = $('<a></a>').attr('href','http://www.google.com'); a.trigger('click');
[11:05:12] <Forbidd3n> I only ask because I have this and it isn't working
[11:05:50] <Forbidd3n> I am basically doing a dblclick on a email address field, and get it to open trigger a mailto link
[11:11:25] <t4nk273> can anyone help me out with a piece of code?
[11:12:01] <drej> not until we see it
[11:16:14] <tw2113> or until you give us log in credentials and the location of the code
[11:19:41] <sinli> How can I load image from thumbnail to its oryginal size ? I have a lightbox but when the image is to big it will resize the image but its to small
[11:21:03] <benzhninja> $(document).append(""if ryanair produced their own brand of condoms and you had sex with your girlfriend and you put your willy into the wrong hole, well at least you can say you landed close to where you were supposed to be going");
[11:21:19] <benzhninja> ERROR: illegal character spotted
[11:23:50] <tw2113> too many double quotes at the start benzhninja
[11:24:03] <benzhninja> yeah I see now
[11:24:24] <nicoenarg> hey folks, I may be doing something completely wrong but i have a form setup with a hidden field which should only show depending on whether a checkbox is checked or not, it works fine when the page is first reloaded but when one submits the page and it refreshes because of errors or missing information, the jquery setup used to keep the field hidden doesnt work. not sure if i'm explaining myself right but could someone take a look at
[11:24:24] <nicoenarg> www.creativelogisticsuk.co.uk/index.php/register/ and advise me on where i'm going wrong?
[11:24:53] <nicoenarg> and for some reason the learn.jquery site isn't loading :(
[11:26:43] <sinli> can someone help me to write jquery function to load images on click to their oryginal size, kinda like it is in 4chan ?
[11:37:00] <sinli> can someone help ?
[11:40:13] <nicoenarg> sinli: google "jquery lightbox", no one's going to write a function for you
[11:41:28] <sinli> nicoenarg i did but the dont have a full size lightbox, they always resize it to fit the sreen
[11:42:03] <sinli> i dont even need lightbox i just need maybe an onclick event to get the image from the link to appear in its oryginal size
[11:42:09] <sinli> the most simple way it can be
[11:42:10] <sinli> ...
[11:43:19] <nicoenarg> sinli: make the small thumbnail into a link and href the link to wherever youve stored the large image
[11:43:42] <tw2113> store one of the urls as a data attribute
[11:46:05] <sinli> yeah it works but it needs to display on the same page, without having the user going back to page
[11:46:17] <sinli> same thing kinda as its on 4chan
[11:46:35] <nicoenarg> sinli: give me a link to what you're talking about. i dont frequent 4chan
[11:46:43] <sinli> http://boards.4chan.org/vr/
[11:46:50] <sinli> click on the image
[11:46:53] <tw2113> just need to prevent the default event on link clicking, and switch out src attributes
[11:47:40] <nicoenarg> brb
[11:47:45] <sinli> ok
[11:47:51] <nicoenarg> on and check the source, that will give you an idea what to do
[11:47:54] <nicoenarg> lunch break
[11:48:00] <tw2113> or technically output both, and on click, .hide() the one that's showing, and .show() the hidden one
[11:49:30] <nicoenarg> tw2113: can you help me with understand maybe why the field that is hidden under company details (company number) using jquery works well and remains hidden when the page is first loaded but on submit if there are errors on the page it isn't hidden anymore? www.creativelogisticsuk.co.uk/register/
[11:49:56] <tw2113> nope :D
[11:50:06] <tw2113> because i'm leaving soon
[11:50:16] <nicoenarg> sinli i can help you out after i come back if you want if you haven't figured it out by then
[11:50:19] <nicoenarg> tw2113: fair enough
[11:50:31] <s5fs> nicoenarg: jQuery sites are being ddos'd.
[11:50:53] <nicoenarg> s5fs: ah no wonder, can't access anything at all and i'm completely lost
[11:51:21] <tw2113> yay for hosting your own copy of the library
[11:51:40] <s5fs> tw2113: The public websites are not the CDN, totally different services / providers / etc
[11:52:05] <nicoenarg> jquery document ready only executes once, right? so when a form refreshes (retaining already entered values) that function wouldn't run...so what function would i use to make sure the functionality is as i want it to be?
[11:52:20] <tw2113> my statement stands </politicalstatement> :P
[11:52:41] <s5fs> nicoenarg: api.jquery.com is still up though, this is great documentation but not quite as friendly to the newcomer
[11:52:56] <nicoenarg> <--- newcomer but thanks, i'll check it out for answers
[11:52:56] <s5fs> tw2113: fully agree, host your own files if you want total control.
[11:53:38] <s5fs> tw2113: I just wanted to be clear that they are two separate services. I want to ensure people are confident with the CDN.
[11:53:50] <tw2113> i know :P
[11:53:50] <unnu> whatsup #jquery
[11:54:10] <s5fs> unnu: oh you know, livin' lovin'
[11:54:18] <unnu> sweetness
[11:54:36] <unnu> im just here, still fighting with my xml
[11:54:47] <unnu> never used jquery and xml before
[11:55:19] <rpag> jsonify
[12:06:15] <snico> lost connection for a while...
[12:06:39] <alaing> evening
[12:07:11] <snico> im still trying to figure out how to do this
[12:07:48] <snico> click on the image http://boards.4chan.org/vg/ and see how this works
[12:08:00] <snico> it displays the image to its oryginal size
[12:08:20] <snico> but not sure how to make the even on click working
[12:09:10] <alaing> snico whats the issue?
[12:11:02] <snico> i have a lightbox but when the user uploads a big image lets say 2000px height it resizes the image very small so i need a event on click that it would show the oryginal size image when somone click on the thumbnail
[12:11:14] <snico> same kinda like it is on 4chan
[12:11:54] <snico> i wrote a php function that detects images that are over 2000px height and i would just use the onclick even for that
[12:12:08] <snico> but not sure how to do it
[12:12:42] <snico> but its basically something that 4chan is using
[12:13:05] <snico> display the image to its oryginal size when clicking on the thumbnail
[12:15:19] <snico> <a href=\"".$images."\" class=\"testting\" > <img class=\"resizeimgnew magnify\"   src='".$images."'/></a>";
[12:15:33] <snico> this is what im using for the html part
[12:15:48] <snico> so i thought of a on click even there to get th image
[12:22:17] <snico> alaing ?
[12:25:23] <unnu> question, ive got var xml in firebug as an xml document, but my breakpoint of var XML = $.parseXML(xml); has XML as null
[12:25:44] <unnu> what do i have to do to get XML as a jq obj ?
[12:30:25] <snico> can someone help ?
[12:30:49] <miCSu> unnu: not quite sure, but taken a quick look at http://api.jquery.com/jquery.parsexml/ it seems like $.parseXML creates the xmldocument object and to get an jquery object from that you'd have to $($.parseXML(xml));
[12:31:23] <unnu> hrmmm
[12:31:44] <unnu> i am just having troubles with searching the xml document i think
[12:32:11] <unnu> miCSu, are you familiar with .xml parsing with jquery?
[12:32:20] <miCSu> nope
[12:32:20] <unnu> i am sure i am doing something stupid
[12:32:39] <unnu> well dratz
[12:34:21] <Kwaku> why isnt my script working? http://codepen.io/maxtimfin/pen/lnDjo
[12:34:39] <Kwaku> My goal is to slide eggimg over eggdiv
[12:34:42] <steelbrain> let me have a look into it
[12:35:07] <Kwaku> with egg div as the hover trigger
[12:36:20] <alaing> Kwaku: just taking a look
[12:37:37] <steelbrain> @Kwaku, you might want to use css animations
[12:37:46] <steelbrain> ass they're more cpu friendly and simple
[12:37:51] <steelbrain> *as
[12:38:03] <alaing> Kwaku: do you want it to "slide" in?
[12:38:34] <alaing> also your hover is on your img not the div
[12:39:47] <Kwaku> alaing, that would be nice, but I don't understand jquery'd slide buisness. from what i understand I have to have an extra link to the jquery effect
[12:40:36] <Kwaku> I have done the slideUp/slideDown, but I can't get a slide left or right to work
[12:46:36] <snico> can someone help?
[12:48:01] <alaing> Kwaku: so you want to just see a black box and then when you move over it you want the red one to slide in
[12:49:12] <Kwaku> alaing, here it is again http://codepen.io/maxtimfin/pen/lnDjo
[12:49:13] <Kwaku> ala
[12:49:41] <Kwaku> alaing, yeah, I will apply overflow: hidden to eggimg when I see I have it solved
[12:49:55] <Kwaku> or rather to eggdiv
[12:58:31] <alaing> Kwaku: http://codepen.io/anon/pen/yKtms
[12:58:47] <alaing> you right the sliding i left to right is part of jquery ui
[12:59:36] <alaing> of sliding up/down http://codepen.io/anon/pen/yKtms
[13:03:25] <Kwaku> alaing, why the .on?
[13:04:14] <alaing> its the proper way to attact event listeners to elements
[13:04:53] <alaing> I think their might be a .on('hover') but then you still need to work out which event is firing
[13:07:45] <alaing> Kwaku: ^ http://codepen.io/anon/pen/sdIBr
[13:08:02] <alaing> theres one with .hover but I would use .on()
[13:10:06] <Kwaku> i just tried it with .on('hover',......... and that didn't work
[13:11:14] <alaing> yeah the docs say there isn't 'hover'
[13:11:40] <alaing> but you can target the events with mouseover mouseleave
[13:11:56] <Kwaku> right, mouseenter, mouseleave, &c
[13:12:39] <alaing> correct
[13:13:06] <Kwaku> too cool. thnx
[13:14:16] <alaing> mouseenter means it will fire off sooner than mouse over
[13:14:25] <alaing> no problem
[13:14:30] <alaing> time to call it a night
[13:14:38] <alaing> see you all around
[13:17:07] <ottoman2> Hi! Was directed here from #javascript. I parse an XML document, part of it looks like this:
[13:17:07] <ottoman2> <ipinterface instanceid="3"><mtu>1492</mtu></ipinterface>
[13:17:07] <ottoman2> Reads it like this: xmlDoc = $.parseXML( xml ), $xml = $( xmlDoc );
[13:17:07] <ottoman2> Loop for a while, and can read out most of the data I want, i.e. $(this).context.tagName.
[13:17:07] <ottoman2> But, can I find instanceid somewhere, without trying to parse outerHTML..?
[13:22:59] <shoky> ottoman2: $element.attr('instanceid')
[13:24:42] <Kwaku> l
[13:25:26] <Kwaku> in this example: http://codepen.io/anon/pen/yKtms how would I make the eggimg hidden by default?
[13:25:27] <alaing> ottoman2: $xml.find('ipinterface').attr('instanceid')
[13:25:44] <Kwaku> rather, when the page loads...
[13:26:38] <ottoman2> alaing, shoky, that worked, thanks a lot! Is there something I could read to understand why..? I can't find it in the data structure (console.log($(element))
[13:26:43] <alaing> Kwaku: http://codepen.io/anon/pen/yKtms
[13:27:10] <jeffreylevesque> can you store a file object like a docx in json?
[13:27:11] <Kwaku> duh
[13:27:16] <Kwaku> i knew that, i swear
[13:28:04] <alaing> ottoman2: when you parse the xml jquery wraps all the <xml> tags around the content so using .find it drills down the structure looking for that element
[13:28:24] <alaing> ottoman2: if you have more than one then you will want to use like .each()
[13:29:05] <ottoman2> alaing, I understand that part. But what does attr do, and where does it find the data?
[13:29:33] <alaing> Check out the jQuery docs
[13:29:36] <alaing> api.jqueyr.com
[13:29:41] <alaing> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.parseXML/
[13:29:58] <alaing> http://api.jquery.com/attr/
[13:30:15] <alaing> you can add values to the elements as well
[13:30:23] <alaing> anyway i have to go now
[13:30:29] <alaing> need to get some sleep
[13:30:45] <alaing> good night
[13:30:46] <shoky> ottoman2: instanceid is an attribute. it is found in your xml ;)
[13:31:01] <ottoman2> And that document only talks about jQuery.parseXML( data )... I have read it a few times today ;) God night :)
[13:31:13] <ottoman2> Shoky, yes, but it is not in the data structure.. :P
[13:31:53] <shoky> ottoman2: console.log doesnt necessarily show you the tree structure of it, and doesn't necessarily know how you want a jquery object displayed
[13:32:26] <ottoman2> shoky: Make sense... But, how do I know how an object looks like?
[13:33:04] <shoky> ottoman2: but if you try:  console.log( $xml[0] )  to log the DOM object (not wrapped in a jquery obj)  then a normal browser would let you expand that tree fragment in your console
[13:34:09] <ottoman2> Yes, and it does. But there is no member named instanceid, which make sense. And no member that has the value I'm looking for. So attr must get it from somewhere, or does it do some parsing?
[13:34:39] <shoky> donno what you mean by "member". the attribute is visible in the console, for me
[13:35:06] <shoky> here  http://jsfiddle.net/adptswy5/
[13:36:16] <shoky> well in chrome at least ;)
[13:39:15] <ottoman2> shoky, I didn't use [0], and if I remove that in your example, I can't find it there neither. But, I should perhaps just accept to use attr :)
[13:41:36] <shoky> it's there.. even if you can't find it ;P
[13:44:46] <shoky> you'll see the '0' property, pointing to an object containing a representation of the xml tree. this object has properties such as childNodes which point to the stuff inside, those have "attributes" property and "getAttribute" method, etc
[13:45:23] <shoky> (and .attr just calls .getAttribute )
[13:45:34] <shoky> ottoman2 ^
[13:46:00] <ottoman2> Thanks for the explanation :)

[14:16:26] <gabriel> sorry while i was typing that i was in panic mode
[14:16:39] <gabriel> need to put this ting live
[14:17:22] <Prometheian> If I'm using an AJAX call that requires JSONP, is there a way for me to bind the JSONP directly into a variable instead of a method?
[14:19:16] <pheas> gabriel: ok now i got you , i have to use this on the phone
[14:20:00] <pheas> with the down arrows you want to disable the whole link or just it's children?
[14:20:15] <pheas> Nice site btw
[14:31:06] <pheas> the jquery site is still down , i was wondering do they have multi-select drop down?
[14:33:30] <FofG> I have a bunch of divs with <a> tags inside of them. I have a $(".myclass").click() for that a tag. I want the click to get called only for the one that was clicked (if that makes sense). Is there a way to accomplish that?
[14:51:31] <__joshua__> $("div .myclass:last").click()
[15:15:39] <thejman> I just spent the last three months learning javascript when I could've been learning jquery instead
[15:23:25] <__joshua__> huh
[15:23:43] <__joshua__> jquery is javascript
[15:25:51] <__joshua__> jquery offers a marginally more expanded selection system (which is actually called sizzle), a nice-ish event delegation system, ajax wrappers, and some animation options, and a broken promise system.  with emca5/6 shims you can survive quite well without it
[15:30:45] <systemfault> lol
[15:31:01] <systemfault> __joshua__: Kind of sad that he didn't get that in 3 months...
[15:57:51] <luvmyh0nda> Hi, I am working on migrating to the new version of jQuery UI. In my program, I have some code to dynamically add tabs using tabs('add','/dynamic/tab/url','Tab Name'); and have noticed that this is now deprecated. Is this possible with the new version of jqui?
[16:07:42] <__joshua__> i doubt they removed features, just changed syntax
[16:08:59] <__joshua__> but docs are down for me
[16:09:44] <Prometheian> When binding a click to a method I've setup in my viewmodel, can I pass a parameter to it? Specifically the text value that I'm also databinding.
[16:09:46] <luvmyh0nda> yeah, the entire jquery sites are down
[16:09:51] <luvmyh0nda> database issue it appears
[16:10:03] <luvmyh0nda> , the actual "add" method has been removed
[16:10:23] <luvmyh0nda> I found an example of how to add them dynamically, but not by using a URL, just by using the actual content
[16:13:02] <__joshua__> looks like refresh was designed to replace add and remove
[16:13:43] <luvmyh0nda> but isn't that meant to be used after you add the content?
[16:16:52] <__joshua__> yeah, add the content, refresh
[16:17:16] <luvmyh0nda> so, essentially it's an ajax call, THEN add the content, THEN refresh, correct?
[16:19:15] <__joshua__> $('.some_div').tabs();       //some point later   $('.some_div ul').append($('<li/>').text('tab name')); $('.some_div').tabs('refresh');   //i would guess like this
[16:21:09] <luvmyh0nda> according to this post: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14702631/in-jquery-ui-1-9-how-do-you-create-new-tabs-dynamically I would have to add not only the LI to the ul, but also add the DIV. But prior to adding the DIV, I would need to fetch the content via ajax
[16:21:17] <Prometheian> How can I get my viewmodel setup in a linked JS file and usable in my main file?
[16:25:48] <__joshua__> luvmyh0nda: can't you just add the non id href <a href="ajax/example.php">Exmaple</a>
[16:26:04] <__joshua__> so that the content div is async
[16:27:58] <luvmyh0nda> so append <li id='tab_name'><a href='ajax/example.php'>Tab Name</a></li>? wouldn't I have to add the corresponding div as well, or would it auto-create once I refreshed the tabs?
[16:28:20] <luvmyh0nda> (i really wish someone would correct the db error on jqueryui.com) lol
[16:29:54] <__joshua__> if you don't have to make the div the first time, i don't see why you have to the second time
[16:33:34] <luvmyh0nda> ok, so that did work, just append li & a with the href='url' - next question - how was tabs('select') replaced?
[16:33:53] <luvmyh0nda> or i should say what is the new method to select a tab?
[16:48:41] <paulvd> hello, how can i get the height of the background image in jquery ?
[16:49:26] <__joshua__> $("#tabs").tabs("option", "active", index);
[16:49:39] <luvmyh0nda> paulvd: how are you setting your background image? are you using css background?
[16:50:02] <luvmyh0nda> __joshua__: is that 0-indexed?
[16:50:05] <paulvd> yes
[16:50:07] <paulvd> with php
[16:50:14] <paulvd> making a fiddle to test
[16:50:18] <paulvd> have already written a code
[16:50:42] <luvmyh0nda> paulvd: have you tried $(window).height() ?
[16:51:27] <luvmyh0nda> __joshua__: got it, it is 0-indexed, and that solution worked perfectly
[16:51:37] <paulvd> luvmyh0nda: "background-image"
[16:51:41] <paulvd> not window height
[16:51:43] <paulvd> dude
[16:52:14] <luvmyh0nda> paulvd: you may be further ahead using php to get the height of the graphic...
[16:52:22] <paulvd> http://jsfiddle.net/0cL67krt/
[16:52:35] <paulvd> found code from here >
[16:52:36] <paulvd> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5106243/how-do-i-get-background-image-size-in-jquery
[16:53:01] <__joshua__> paulvd:  hmmm. a guess:   create a new image with src set to bg property
[16:53:27] <__joshua__> ya.  like in those sof answers
[16:53:30] <luvmyh0nda> or loading it into a div with a z-index behind your page, and transparent opacity, then getting the height of the div
[16:53:56] <paulvd> yes
[16:53:58] <paulvd> i did that
[16:54:07] <paulvd> hm loading it in a hidden div would load it twice
[16:54:14] <__joshua__> no it wouldn't
[16:54:19] <luvmyh0nda> it's already cached
[16:54:21] <__joshua__> but use new Image() anyway
[16:54:28] <paulvd> ok
[17:45:56] <end-of-file> Hi all guys. I have a bug in a slider panel and I'm trying to fix it without success...this is the url http://www.mondoblackberry.com/test-page-menu-news/ the bug is: - if I go on MondoBlackBerry and later on iMondoApple the background content don't cover all news. But if I go on MondoBlackBerry and later if I go outside and I wait the rollover of my menu and go to iMondoApple, the problem didn't
[17:45:56] <end-of-file> happen. Any people can suggests me a fix? the js code is there: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/e65ee1818c8a5a95ea18
[17:47:31] <luvmyh0nda> end-of-file: i just checked it out, it's covering for me
[17:47:37] <luvmyh0nda> what browser are you using?
[17:48:19] <end-of-file> luvmyh0nda: chrome latest version. Try to put your mouse on MondoBlackberry, later on iMondoApple and later on MondoWindowsPhone...don't wait the rollover of the menu
[17:49:23] <luvmyh0nda> ah, i see your issue
[17:49:32] <luvmyh0nda> do you have a stop() anywhere?
[17:49:50] <luvmyh0nda> actually..
[17:50:05] <luvmyh0nda> now that i look at it, neither of the other two load completely
[17:51:27] <end-of-file> luvmyh0nda: yeah I know it...
[17:51:39] <end-of-file> luvmyh0nda: what can you suggest me to do?
[17:52:37] <luvmyh0nda> let me look at it for a couple of minutes. it's as if the other two heights aren't loading correctly
[17:55:44] <luvmyh0nda> try changing line 132 to $currentItem.data('height') from $previousItem.data('height')
[17:57:24] <end-of-file> luvmyh0nda: done! but the result it's the same :(
[17:57:46] <luvmyh0nda> in looking at it, data('height') is never set :\
[17:59:07] <end-of-file> luvmyh0nda: I set the height in html page
[17:59:27] <end-of-file> look there https://gist.github.com/anonymous/bcb975617b3ab372bb12
[17:59:31] <luvmyh0nda> yes, but on line 70, it should set the data-height of the element to the height
[18:02:34] <end-of-file> luvmyh0nda: what can you suggest me to do?
[18:03:29] <luvmyh0nda> when it manually runs, it shows the heights as 555, 450 and 450, give me a couple more minutes, still looking at it
[18:06:37] <luvmyh0nda> the heights for the UL's, have you tried changing those to min-height ?
[18:07:25] <luvmyh0nda> (eg, mondopw-second, etc)
[18:09:40] <shebbi> hi, trying to get jquery dialog to work in jsfiddle. I think I need to add the jquery UI resource for it to work, but don't know how. here is the link: http://jsfiddle.net/3jyf9zpu/5/
[18:09:45] <shebbi> Please help
[18:11:43] <end-of-file> luvmyh0nda: yeah I set it on html, look there: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/bcb975617b3ab372bb12
[18:12:02] <luvmyh0nda> shebbi: you missed a ); and forgot to load jqui: http://jsfiddle.net/3jyf9zpu/6/
[18:13:13] <luvmyh0nda> end-of-file: if you remove height: 340px and change to min-height:340px, does it work?
[18:14:25] <end-of-file> luvmyh0nda: no :( https://gist.github.com/anonymous/7c8a082103786ebbcec7
[18:21:40] <end-of-file> luvmyh0nda: it seems that don't read the min-height :(
[18:22:33] <luvmyh0nda> hmm... let me stew on it for a little while. something isn't correctly reading so that it can re-set the height :\
[18:22:39] <luvmyh0nda> some tells me it's a css problem
[18:25:53] <end-of-file> luvmyh0nda: I don't think is a CSS problem...
[18:27:15] <luvmyh0nda> well, the way the css is being interpreted
[18:28:57] <end-of-file> luvmyh0nda: but the CSS looks ok! I check it right now!
[18:32:15] <HowardwLo> http://api.jquery.com/jquery.post/ can you use .serialize() in the example at the bottom?
[18:32:38] <HowardwLo> the shorthand for ajax is a bit confusing to me, and im trying to learn how to do a form post with ajax
[18:39:56] <shebbi> Hi, I have a Query Dialog that can only be closed once. http://jsfiddle.net/3jyf9zpu/14/
[18:40:34] <shebbi> Console says something about cannot destroy dialog prior to initialisation.
[18:42:05] <sacrebleu> when doing an $.ajax, my "GET" mode variable does not make it through, possible causes?

[19:06:01] <shebbi> Console says something about cannot destroy dialog prior to initialisation.
[19:21:25] <zquad> JQUERY: I have a div with 4 input boxes.  I set the value of each input box then $('div').html() but the html does not have values.  How do I copy the html with values?
[19:38:08] <__joshua__> you should set value with $('div input').val('myval')
[19:38:18] <__joshua__> and get values with .val()
[19:42:08] <HowardwLo> $(#).length > 0 .. best way to check if osmething exists?
[19:44:51] <__joshua__> its pretty common way
[19:45:25] <HowardwLo> if it doesnt exist, i get a TypeError
[19:45:25] <__joshua__> or just if($('asd').length){....
[19:45:35] <HowardwLo> any way to avoid errors?
[19:45:38] <__joshua__> you mean if $ doesn't exist?
[19:45:52] <HowardwLo> if $(#myele)
[19:45:55] <HowardwLo> doesnt exist
[19:46:04] <__joshua__> are you actually writing that?
[19:46:09] <HowardwLo> basically checking if that element exists
[19:46:18] <__joshua__> if($('#myele')){....
[19:46:25] <HowardwLo> right, with quotes
[19:46:34] <__joshua__> and brakets
[19:46:37] <HowardwLo> ya
[19:46:51] <__joshua__> and what is the value of $
[19:47:19] <HowardwLo> $ has a value?
[19:47:52] <__joshua__> if you have included jquery
[19:49:04] <__joshua__> $('...') style selector should only throw a  custom 'Syntax' error if you have ill formed the query string
[19:49:21] <__joshua__> if you are getting a type error, you are probably doing somethign else wrong
[19:50:13] <shebbi> Hi, I have a Query Dialog that can only be closed once. http://jsfiddle.net/3jyf9zpu/14/
[19:50:18] <HowardwLo> oh....
[19:50:21] <shebbi> Console says something about cannot destroy dialog prior to initialisation.
[19:50:46] <HowardwLo> well, im trying to see if #ele exists in the data returned by ajax
[19:50:49] <HowardwLo> let me get you a paste
[19:51:19] <HowardwLo> __joshua__: https://dpaste.de/XdDc
[19:51:43] <HowardwLo> i was unsure how to check if #page_dim_content exists in the response
[19:51:59] <__joshua__> can you please paste an example of the response data?
[19:53:05] <__joshua__> shebbi: don't destroy in the close handler
[19:53:31] <HowardwLo> __joshua__: the response will either be “success” in plain text in html, or https://dpaste.de/MSK9
[19:54:07] <HowardwLo> if its plain text “success” im going to do one thing, if page_dim_content exists, im going to replaceAll
[19:55:05] <__joshua__> oh right, thats why you are getting type error
[19:57:08] <HowardwLo> so would my if statment be like if(elms.find(‘#page_dim_content’).length ) ?
[19:57:21] <__joshua__> that would do it
[19:58:04] <HowardwLo> awesome, thanks
[20:10:26] <shebbi> __joshua__: removing it doesn't fix it.
[20:37:03] <shebbi> http://jsfiddle.net/3jyf9zpu/15/ <-- cannot clone back button
[22:01:21] <unnu> anyone still up?
[22:03:14] <unnu> if my xml is <states><state><name>Alabama</name><abv>AL</abv><counties><county>Autauga County</county></counties></state></states>      and i have $xml as the xml containg it, how would i .find the state with the name="alabama" and grab each of the counties?
[22:37:16] <unnu> anyone?
[22:51:46] <Robdgreat> unnu: what I'd do is console.log($xml) and see what it looks like
[22:52:15] <Robdgreat> unless $xml is a string, and not an xml object
[22:52:45] <Robdgreat> I really am not sure what you're doing, just trying to help in the absence of any other responses, it being ridiculous o'clock in the States
[23:22:03] <litropy> Alright, I haven't begun coding this yet, but I've given it a lot of thought. Let me know if there's a better way. I have a slider (yep same one for those who've been here today). I sense swipe using touchSwipe, a jquery plugin, then send that value to my function that tells each photo to animate its position left or right the width of a photo div. That has been written and works fine, except: When the user pinch-zooms, it happens natively -  touch
[23:22:03] <litropy> Swipe doesn't handle pinches. However, touchSwipe is still listening for swipes. So when the user attempts to scroll the zoomed photo to an unseen, off-screen position, instead touchSwipe picks it up and slides (undesirable). So here's what I'm thinking, although it seems kinda hacky: overlay a div atop the slider with the touchSwipe listener. Set up a function that checks every 0.5 secs whether my photo div is larger than the viewport. If it is, t
[23:22:04] <litropy> hen remove the overlayed touchSwipe div. Still listening, when it senses full zoomout, re-lay the touchSwipe div.
[23:28:57] <Jattenalle> litropy, no
[23:29:06] <Jattenalle> litropy, add a check in the slide event instead
[23:29:19] <Jattenalle> inside the slide: if(zoomed)doSomething;
[23:30:42] <litropy> Jattenalle, but in that way, I'd have to tell it to move the photo with the user's finger, then move it back when not zoomed. It would look kinda odd zooming out to a misaligned photo, then watching it move back into place.
[23:31:09] <Jattenalle> that can be fixed with some maths
[23:31:15] <Jattenalle> using a timer will always fail
[23:31:21] <Jattenalle> because 0.5s is a long time
[23:31:44] <Jattenalle> so people will either try to zoom/swipe when it doesnt work
[23:31:48] <Jattenalle> and be annoyed and report a bug
[23:33:38] <litropy> Jattenalle, so, as the user zooms out (now I'll detect pinches using another plugin), proportionately adjust the position of the misaligned photo, so that when zoomed all the way out, it's back in place?
[23:33:46] <Jattenalle> exactly
[23:33:57] <Jattenalle> you can use some em magic, or just JS
[23:34:26] <Jattenalle> it's more work, but users wont get "false-positive" "i can't zoom/swipe!" bugs
[23:34:48] <Jattenalle> and don't fall into the trap of reducing the delay from 0.5s to 0.1s and so on, same problem ;)
[23:34:54] <Jattenalle> trust me, been there, done that... i was dumb
[23:35:16] <litropy> Jattenalle, got a pinch/swipe plugin you like?
[23:35:27] <Jattenalle> i dont do handheld dev, so no :(
[23:35:39] <litropy> Ah, np thx
[23:49:33] <HowardwLo> if i use .replaceAll with ajax response data for #center_section, does that mean all of my event listeners must start with #center_section?
[23:49:44] <HowardwLo> #center_section .inner_child
[23:49:47] <HowardwLo> etc ?
[23:50:11] <Cork> HowardwLo: no it has to start on the element above #center_section
[23:50:30] <Cork> the center_section element(s) is replaced
[23:50:37] <HowardwLo> Cork: ah
[23:50:50] <HowardwLo> am i doing it incorrectly?
[23:50:55] <HowardwLo> is this generally how it is?
[23:51:13] <Cork> HowardwLo: a little to little context
[23:51:19] <Cork> but yes, if you replace a dom element
[23:51:32] <Cork> all events related to the old element (and children) is lost
[23:51:48] <HowardwLo> (#center_section_holder #center_section .inner_child) so it will be something like that?
[23:52:02] <Cork> HowardwLo: you can delegate the event handler to the parent though
[23:53:32] <HowardwLo> Cork: what do you mean?
[23:54:18] <Cork> ?g api.jquery.com delegate
[23:54:19] <b-ot> Cork: .delegate() | jQuery API Documentation → http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[23:59:53] <HowardwLo> Cork: right
