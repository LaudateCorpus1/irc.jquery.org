[00:06:13] <defk0n> can someone explain to me the top answer on this, http://stackoverflow.com/questions/824349/modify-the-url-without-reloading-the-page/3354511#3354511
[00:06:40] <defk0n> what does this do document.getElementById("content").innerHTML = response.html;
[00:07:03] <defk0n> what is response? does that need passing into the function
[00:07:14] <Cork> it expects that response is an object with a variable html
[00:07:19] <defk0n> by ajax like var response = html(data);
[00:07:43] <Cork> response = { html: '', pageTitle: '' }
[00:08:04] <Cork> also if you're after push state i recommend checking mdn
[00:08:12] <Cork> ?g mdn pushState

[00:08:31] <gavroche> Hi! I need to bind together 2 events but with parameters
[00:08:36] <defk0n> hmmm like that
[00:08:50] <gavroche> this works: http://jsfiddle.net/gavroche/J9H5g/
[00:09:16] <defk0n> urlPath is a string?
[00:09:21] <gavroche> I woant to bind mouseenter() and mouseleave()
[00:09:24] <defk0n> full or relative
[00:09:40] <Cork> gavroche: why don't you just store the string in .data ?
[00:10:02] <Cork> and make the javascript generic for the tooltip code
[00:11:29] <gavroche> will try that. thanks for the ideea
[00:16:10] <otiuk> to get the previous input tag's name why would this not work?  $(this).prev('input').attr('name');
[00:16:48] <Cork> otiuk: it only works if the input is the closest previous element
[00:17:06] <Cork> prev checks the previous element, and if it is an input it returns it else it returns nothing
[00:17:16] <Cork> you most likely want nextAll().first()
[00:17:37] <otiuk> ya it is returning undefined.. i am trying to get the last input before the click
[00:18:03] <Erma> Cork: Thanks for the pjax plugin. It did not really work for me.
[00:18:23] <Erma> not really getting the get back button working
[00:18:49] <Cork> Erma: you need to implement the popState event
[00:20:24] <Erma> Do you any good tutorial link that i can refer too
[00:20:35] <Erma> might be i am doing something wrong
[00:22:29] <Cork> gave you one before
[00:22:32] <Cork> ?g mdn pushState
[00:22:32] <b-ot> Cork: Manipulating the browser history - Web developer guide | MDN → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/DOM/Manipulating_the_browser_history
[00:24:51] <otiuk> Cork: i tried using both $(this).nextAll('input').first().attr('name') and .$(this).prevAll('input).first().attr('name') and both return undefined
[00:25:31] <Cork> otiuk: could you generate a demo?
[00:25:31] <Cork> ?p
[00:25:31] <Cork> `p
[00:25:33] <Cork> sigh
[00:25:37] <Cork> jsfiddle.net <--
[00:25:51] <otiuk> ya let me try to type out an example
[00:32:10] <rainabba> If I'm trying $('<div>foo<div')  (note the missing > at the end), is there a way I can detect that the string wasn't parsed into fully valid html (xhtml might be the more correct term)?
[00:32:54] <rainabba> I'm dealing with the Kendo editor and I want to try to notify the user if their html isn't well-formed before saving./
[00:33:49] <Cork> rainabba: think you can as you can't get a valid dom from that
[00:34:06] <Cork> though if you want to be sure everything is valid, you prob need to run a validator on it
[00:34:13] <Cork> (the dom tries to fix things)
[00:34:33] <rainabba> Cork: How would I know though? What it if was more complex? The behavior seems to be that poorly formed elments are escaped to text and good one's become valid elements.
[00:35:27] <Cork> rainabba: ya, a tag (closing or opening) that isn't complete is taken as text
[00:36:27] <Cork> rainabba: you could try https://github.com/peterjwest/html_validator
[00:38:19] <rainabba> ty
[00:38:30] <otiuk> sigh of course the example in jsfiddle works.. but not in the app :/
[00:41:32] <otiuk> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/CM3Yr/
[00:41:48] <otiuk> ok i figured out it's adding the <div> around the link that seems to break it
[00:42:04] <Cork> otiuk: closest('li').prev().find('input')
[00:42:52] <Cork> or if you go from the link closest('li').find('input')
[00:43:12] <Cork> otiuk: and also, please don't abuse links
[00:43:38] <otiuk> how so?
[00:44:32] <otiuk> you mean use a different tag other than a link?
[00:44:56] <Cork> <span tabindex="0" class="clicker"></span>
[00:45:20] <Cork> and .clicker { text-decoration: underline; color: blue; cursor: pointer; }
[00:52:43] <rockwood> Hi everyone.
[00:52:54] <ryorky1> has anyone used the jquery treetable plugin?
[00:53:17] <rockwood> I have a problem and please you guys help me on this.
[00:53:35] <ryorky1> rockwood, what's the problem?
[00:55:49] <rockwood> I have a page which is loading with onload function. Let's assume this is page A. now i am loading another div from other page (let's say page B) with jquery which have a form. I am unable to submit this form.
[00:56:40] <Cork> rockwood: do you mean .load by onload?
[00:56:52] <rockwood> yes
[00:56:59] <Cork> or do you mean that you load page B directly when page A is loaded?
[00:57:20] <rockwood> yes exactly the same
[00:57:25] <Cork> ok
[00:57:40] <Cork> where and how are you binding to make the form submission?
[00:59:32] <rockwood> http://jsfiddle.net/8Bsgw/ this is the link. the form is in html part which is from page B
[01:00:14] <Cork> rockwood: ya, but where are you running the binding?
[01:00:26] <Cork> in the the code on page A?
[01:01:33] <rockwood> sorry but i am not getting what you mean by form submission binding.
[01:01:56] <Cork> rockwood: if i understand it correctly what you do is:
[01:02:07] <Cork> page a loads, it binds a submit event on it's form
[01:02:17] <Cork> when this form is clicked you want to submit a from from page b?
[01:02:40] <nesoi> anyone here use jquery mobile? I'm finding that mobile.changepage sometimes isn't working somehow
[01:02:40] <Cork> that most likely means you try to find the second form before it exist in the dom
[01:03:00] <Cork> rockwood: but without seeing how your structure hangs together i can only guess at it
[01:03:59] <rockwood> i want to do the exactly what you are guessing but i think i am missing something somewhere. if i show you the page can you help?
[01:04:32] <Cork> rockwood: possible, unless it is too much content to plow through
[01:05:22] <rockwood> ok i'll try not to paste unnecessary code . please wait for a mooment
[01:07:21] <webstenno> good day, i bind my event callbacks with .on(). What would be the preferred way of binding multiple callbacks to the same event? can i just use .on() twice?
[01:07:45] <systemfault> webstenno: Sure
[01:07:50] <webstenno> alright, thanks
[01:08:37] <besingamk> im using jquery ajax to load external html files. but the overflow scroll dont show on IE8.. any idea ? thanks
[01:09:44] <Cork> besingamk: just a guess, but try zoom: 1;
[01:10:14] <systemfault> zoom on IE8?
[01:10:35] <Cork> ya, it still has the hasLayout shit
[01:10:54] <Cork> it drastically reduced the number of element it matters on though
[01:11:01] <systemfault> Ah ok
[01:11:08] <Cork> only element i remember needing it on is <form> elements
[01:11:20] <Cork> (in ie8)
[01:11:22] <systemfault> It was foolish enough to think it was totally gone on ie8
[01:11:29] <systemfault> s/It/I
[01:11:35] <rockwood> this is the code for page A. i have erased extra code. please look at this http://pastebin.com/YEYdGdCH.
[01:11:43] <Cork> systemfault: actually i've seen similar problems in chrome
[01:11:44] <rockwood> and this is the code for page B http://pastebin.com/K4KhYBWZ
[01:11:55] <besingamk> thanks
[01:11:56] <besingamk> sir
[01:11:57] <Cork> and fixing it in ie with zoom fixed in chrome too :s
[01:12:08] <systemfault> O_O
[01:12:16] <Cork> i HOPE this is gone since long though
[01:12:23] <Cork> cause this was in like chrome 8
[01:12:57] <Cork> i was like WHY the ** is this not getting a background
[01:13:07] <Cork> and hmmm zoom: 1; and there it was :s
[01:13:30] <systemfault> Okay :(
[01:13:49] <rockwood> Cork can you look at it Page A http://pastebin.com/YEYdGdCH and Page B http://pastebin.com/K4KhYBWZ
[01:13:55] <systemfault> That's like a horror story, I won't be able to sleep tonight because of YOU :(
[01:14:44] <Cork> rockwood: ok, you need to bind the events for page b in the callback to .load
[01:14:51] <Cork> rockwood: or use delegated event listeners
[01:15:02] <Cork> rockwood: your code is running before .load has completed
[01:15:12] <Cork> systemfault: lol
[01:16:00] <systemfault> Cork: You don't want to know how much time I wasted on IE7…. adding/removing position: relative; and zoom: 1; on elements that were misbehaving.
[01:16:13] <Cork> systemfault: i guess i'm too ruined by ie, i didn't think much of it more then "uh, it fixed chrome ?!?; ok"
[01:16:17] <rockwood> how can i do this. how can i bind the events for page B in the callback to .load
[01:16:30] <Cork> systemfault: ie7 wans't that bad
[01:16:41] <Cork> i don't want to think about ie5.5 and ie6...
[01:17:01] <Cork> every feature i ever wrote that needed support for those was * 10 for those two browsers
[01:17:06] <systemfault> Cork: I was fortunate enough to start my carreer at the end of IE6's popularity
[01:17:08] <rockwood> please help as i am not very exepeirenced coder
[01:17:20] <systemfault> :(
[01:17:27] <Cork> systemfault: ah, i started before ie4 :x
[01:17:38] <Cork> when netscape was still the BIG party on the net
[01:17:39] <systemfault> Oh my….
[01:17:53] <Cork> and by big i mean like 80%+ of the market
[01:18:15] <systemfault> I remember using netscape communicator :/
[01:18:26] <Cork> `api load
[01:18:27] <b-ot> Cork: .load(): Load data from the server and place the returned HTML into the matched element. http://api.jquery.com/load/
[01:18:35] <Cork> rockwood: check that page, it has a callback
[01:18:44] <Cork> use that to bind the events for the second page
[01:18:50] <rockwood> ok i'll try
[01:18:52] <rockwood> thanks
[01:19:14] <Cork> systemfault: my biggest memory of it was that it supported rendering tables, but not replay with a working table...
[01:19:18] <Cork> (for emails that is)
[01:19:30] <Cork> it always drove me mad
[01:19:38] <systemfault> Wow
[01:19:48] <Cork> generated a nice table with structure of of what should be done
[01:20:23] <Cork> someone on communicator changed in it and returned a long plaintext with line breaks for each column mail back
[01:20:27] <Cork> >_<
[01:20:45] <Cork> and to them it actually looked like a table when they edited it
[01:20:56] <systemfault> Wow
[01:21:05] <Cork> only mail editor i hate more is lotus
[01:21:29] <Cork> lotus has to be the most broken email program in the history of computing,,,
[01:21:41] <systemfault> Is Lotus dead now?
[01:21:46] <besingamk> Cork: idont know happen but it works perfectly .. hahaha thanks
[01:21:49] <Cork> sadly no
[01:22:04] <systemfault> ugh...
[01:22:21] <Cork> zoom wins again...
[01:23:09] <besingamk> hahaha.. yes but when i put the zoom code it didnt work sir.. then i remove again then i save and refresh browser.. and it works now. hahaha
[01:23:20] <Cork> ah
[01:23:38] <besingamk> maybe i just need to put zoom and remove it when i face that prob again hahahaha anyways thank you :D
[01:23:38] <Cork> besingamk: that prob means you had something unsaved :)
[01:24:00] <Cork> and it actually feels better that zoom wasn't needed
[01:24:25] <besingamk> yes maybe.. thanks again.
[01:27:09] <paradoxquine> hey, i'd like to include my site-wide custom jquery-ui on all pages of my site, but also a few specific widgets as well on one page of the site -- is there a reasonable way to achieve that?
[01:28:59] <x00nix> Hi, I use the method jquery.html to create dynamic forms. If I add the attribute required to an input field <input type="text" size="30" required name="membership_period" value ="$defaultValue" /> jQuery transform the required attribute to required=""
[01:29:01] <Cork> paradoxquine: put it all into one big css file load it on all pages
[01:29:11] <ph88> Cork: did you try zepto ?
[01:29:17] <Cork> paradoxquine: and then add an additional class to the widgets you want a special look on
[01:29:23] <x00nix> Is there a way to render the attribute as required without a value?
[01:29:29] <Cork> ph88: no
[01:29:39] <paradoxquine> Sorry, should have clarified - I'm just in need of the js, i have the css situation handled
[01:30:07] <Cork> ph88: but i've had to send generated emails from a server to lotus, and you have to hack around the headers
[01:30:21] <ph88> o_O
[01:30:29] <Cork> ph88: cause if you didn't have a specific order on the headers, and a specific amount of headers
[01:30:34] <Cork> lotus didn't parse the mail
[01:30:37] <ph88> Cork:  i'm talking about this http://zeptojs.com/  ... what are you talking about ??
[01:31:08] <Cork> ph88: ah, i though you talked about the subject we just ended :)
[01:31:20] <ph88> no idea man :D hahaha
[01:32:12] <Cork> ph88: looks largely like a reimplementation of jquery; don't see why i would want it
[01:32:38] <ph88> well if your project has a requirement to be light weight on the js ... it might very well come in handy
[01:32:58] <Cork> ph88: jquery 2 is lightweight enough
[01:33:19] <ph88> ye i know it shrinked
[01:33:29] <ph88> would be interesting to compare size between the 3 of them
[01:33:38] <systemfault> jQuery is much better now than it used to be.
[01:33:46] <Anticom> hi all
[01:33:54] <systemfault> (I think it was bad before 1.6)
[01:34:06] <ph88> Cork:  did you use any of these techniques ?   SIP, WebRTC, XMPP, WebSockets, SSE, Adobe Flash Sockets, ActiveX HTMLFile (IE), XHR with multipart encoding, XHR with long-polling
[01:34:28] <Cork> uh, yes :)
[01:34:32] <systemfault> ph88: You want to hire him or what? :P
[01:34:38] <Anticom> is there a simple way to reverse the .serializeArray() to append a form elements to a form to the dom?
[01:34:53] <ph88> haha no no, but it's nice to talk :) i don't need anything at the moment
[01:35:03] <Anticom> hmm grammmar sux in the morning it seems
[01:35:14] <Cork> ph88:  WebSockets, SSE, Adobe Flash Sockets, ActiveX HTMLFile (IE), XHR with long-polling, and i'm fiddling wityh webrtc on evenings right now
[01:35:23] <systemfault> Hmm, what is SSE? (Beside an instruction set for a CPU)
[01:35:25] <ph88> wow a lot !
[01:35:30] <ph88> SSE is the new stuff :p
[01:35:35] <ph88> server side events
[01:35:36] <Cork> ph88: also i have used comet
[01:35:44] <Cork> ph88: sse is silly
[01:35:51] <ph88> eh Server Sent* Event
[01:35:54] <Cork> its just a none js implementation of long pull
[01:36:12] <systemfault> Ah ok
[01:36:18] <ph88> which one did you like best ?
[01:36:19] <Cork> the connection to the server is closed every time the server sends a message
[01:36:26] <Cork> websocket
[01:36:29] <Cork> without a doubt
[01:36:35] <systemfault> And SSE is unusable I guess ? (In the sense that IE doesn't support it)
[01:36:40] <ph88> i thought that technology was too old by now
[01:36:45] <Cork> as you actually get a REALY mutexed connection
[01:36:50] <Cork> *REAL
[01:36:54] <hazardous> SSE is 'usable' in the way that if you don't care about older browsers at all
[01:37:08] <hazardous> otherwise you'd just use some kind of library that has automatic feature detection, fallbacks and ensuring it works on everything else even using bad hacks
[01:37:18] <Cork> systemfault: you need fallbacks for both webrtc, websocket and sse
[01:37:20] <systemfault> hazardous: Supported on IE9 and IE10?
[01:37:29] <systemfault> Cork: Ah ok
[01:37:40] <ph88> Cork:  did you use a library for websockets ?
[01:37:45] <Cork> nope
[01:37:57] <Cork> i wrote a small plugin my self, ~100 lines of code
[01:38:03] <ph88> nice !
[01:38:10] <ph88> are you gonna put it on github ?
[01:38:11] <Cork> that falls back to longpull when websocket isn't supported
[01:38:22] <Cork> haven't thought about it actually
[01:38:56] <ph88> maybe people would appreciate it
[01:39:06] <ph88> what about this one http://socket.io/  do you know it ?
[01:39:25] <Cork> ya, i tested it, didn't like it at all
[01:39:29] <ph88> hhmm ok
[01:39:37] <ph88> i don't have JS server side even
[01:39:51] <Cork> uh, its just a normal url
[01:40:07] <Cork> just provide a php file that when it finds new data echos it
[01:40:08] <ph88> i meant on the front page there is some server side code example
[01:40:12] <ph88> i think its for node.js
[01:40:15] <Cork> and point sse at it; and you're done
[01:40:31] <ph88> sse ? i thought socket.io was websockets o_O
[01:40:41] <Cork> ah
[01:40:45] <Cork> you meant it that way
[01:40:56] <Cork> ya i only used the client side of socket.io
[01:41:04] <Cork> i don't like running js on the server
[01:41:04] <ph88> oh ok
[01:41:54] <ph88> facebook uses comet
[01:42:01] <systemfault> Eww commet.
[01:42:04] <systemfault> *comet
[01:42:26] <ph88> from what i've read its a long poll which spawn another long poll immediately
[01:42:27] <systemfault> I thought FB used XHR long polling
[01:42:49] <systemfault> And I thought that comet was using an iframe + script tags
[01:42:53] <Cork> ph88: yes that is the point yes
[01:43:02] <ph88> http://stackoverflow.com/a/1086448
[01:43:10] <Cork> systemfault: that isn't the only way to implement comet
[01:43:13] <ph88> systemfault: read that
[01:43:14] <Eviltwin> Facebook has a lot more resources than you
[01:43:23] <Cork> comet means the connection is opened and closed without delay
[01:43:38] <Cork> you basically make a normal ajax request, and when it ends you open a new one
[01:43:50] <Cork> if the server has something to send it sends it; else it just closes the connection
[01:44:05] <Cork> (there by the comet name, as you get a comet shower of connections)
[01:44:49] <systemfault> Ah ok
[01:47:02] <ph88> i just started using opera for debugging javascript now
[01:47:08] <ph88> firebug in firefox was getting too slow
[01:48:27] <newfish> 1112
[01:48:31] <Cork> ph88: why debug javascript in a theme?
[01:48:48] <ph88> theme ?
[01:48:54] <Cork> ph88: opera as a browser is dead, it is just a theme ontop of chromium
[01:49:28] <Cork> they declared eol of there presto engine ~4-5 months ago
[01:49:29] <ph88> i dont know chromium has good tools
[01:49:32] <newfish> a chat room?
[01:49:35] <ph88> ye i know
[01:49:54] <Cork> ph88: so the only opera brings is ui tweeks
[01:50:01] <Cork> *only thing
[01:50:11] <newfish> this chat room is implement by jquery
[01:50:17] <ph88> you think it's bad ?
[01:50:34] <Cork> ph88: i think its sad that they gave up on making a browser
[01:50:44] <systemfault> Same...
[01:50:59] <Cork> ph88: espacially by how much they helped the web standard
[01:51:04] <ph88> yup it is, but the competition was really hard
[01:51:08] <systemfault> What's the point of having an …. Operamium
[01:51:13] <Cork> ph88: not really
[01:51:30] <Cork> what killed them was policies and bad website coding
[01:52:03] <Cork> presto, gecko and v8 isn't allowed on ios
[01:52:11] <ph88> i think google did lots of advertisement and also focus on speed  what makes them winners
[01:52:21] <ph88> and IE was winning in the old days, but just because it was default
[01:52:25] <Cork> and most website developers develop for webkit
[01:52:41] <Cork> ph88: no it's not that easy
[01:53:01] <Cork> opera had almost dominance on the mobile market before
[01:53:14] <Cork> but ios didn't let them compete
[01:53:20] <newfish> firefox is better
[01:53:30] <systemfault> newfish: Because of chrome.
[01:53:33] <Cork> so they droped down to symbian only more or less
[01:53:50] <Cork> systemfault: eh.. no not really
[01:53:51] <systemfault> If it wasn't of chrome, we'd still be using a leaky version of firefox 3.5344345
[01:54:12] <Cork> systemfault: again not true
[01:54:16] <systemfault> Cork: I think the popularity of chrome motivated mozilla to create a better/faster browser.
[01:54:23] <Cork> faster yes
[01:54:34] <Cork> google put the pressure on performance
[01:54:39] <ph88> i think developments in browser land are still too slow
[01:54:46] <Cork> but the other parts has been part of firefox developments before
[01:54:48] <ph88> its very difficult to manage my bookmarks
[01:55:00] <Cork> systemfault: just check the gigantic difference between ff2 and ff3
[01:55:23] <systemfault> Hmm, right...
[01:55:38] <systemfault> Still think that mozilla took a break after 3.x
[01:55:45] <Cork> they didn't
[01:55:59] <Cork> they had long going deep going modifications
[01:56:06] <Cork> and it took a long time to get them in
[01:56:20] <Cork> much of there code was frozen too
[01:56:27] <systemfault> Hmm
[01:56:32] <Cork> cause of binary compatibility
[01:56:50] <Cork> and that slowed development down enormously
[01:57:01] <Cork> now day hey don't have bindary compatibility at all
[01:57:30] <systemfault> Do they have a working 64bit version of their browser now?
[01:57:36] <Cork> sure
[01:57:40] <Cork> they have for a long time
[01:57:41] <systemfault> Ok great.
[01:57:56] <ph88> i think it's very cool you can make browser add-ons with javascript, html and css :D
[01:57:58] <Cork> but just like any other browser vendor not for windows
[01:58:03] <ph88> https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/developers/
[01:58:05] <Cork> as it isn't worth the work
[01:58:20] <Cork> ph88: well nothing really new there
[01:58:25] <Cork> chrome has the same
[01:58:40] <Cork> and the old extensions was the same except it was with xul not html
[01:58:57] <ph88> ye xul -___-
[01:59:02] <systemfault> Seriously… who the hell thought that xul was a good idea..
[01:59:17] <ph88> i think for the time it was alright
[01:59:32] <Cork> systemfault: i did
[01:59:43] <systemfault> Ah :/
[01:59:49] <Cork> it beats the crap out of windows gui markup solusion
[02:00:08] <ph88> and js beats the crap out of xul  xD
[02:00:35] <Cork> remote xul is just as bad as activex on the web though
[02:00:35] <Cork> (aka stupid)
[02:00:36] <Cork> uh...
[02:00:38] <Cork> js != xul
[02:00:49] <Cork> html took the place of xul, not js
[02:01:01] <Cork> mozilla used js before and js now that didn't change at all
[02:01:02] <ph88> don't you have to do js !== xul there ? ;)
[02:01:22] <Cork> no cause even if you type cast them they still isn't the same
[02:01:29] <Cork> one is execution the other is markup
[02:01:38] <ph88> lol type cast that !
[02:03:47] <systemfault> Guys… any thought on ember vs angular…? I'm leaning toward angular because there's less magic and because of directives.
[02:04:41] <ph88> systemfault:  i looked into it earlier, i decided backbone was the best for me
[02:04:52] <Cork> sysdef: i like jqote2 my self
[02:05:17] <Cork> fast but still with the possibility of simple logics in the template
[02:05:23] <Cork> (and not to forget compact)
[02:05:31] <Cork> ops
[02:05:34] <Cork> *systemfault:
[02:05:38] <ph88> backbone + underscore
[02:05:41] <systemfault> I see
[02:07:12] <systemfault> I used backbone in the past.. but had to use something like backbone layoutmanager on top of it or it was hell
[02:07:46] <ph88> what's a layout manager ?
[02:08:32] <systemfault> A way to deal to deal with nested views without writing a ton of boilerplate.
[02:08:44] <ph88> ooh
[02:09:11] <ph88> i think backbone doesnt provide that at all and you are suppose to choose your own library for views
[02:09:34] <systemfault> ph88: Which can be good or bad depending on what you want to do.
[02:09:47] <systemfault> For my current project, I want something with bindings
[02:10:11] <systemfault> So that's why I was looking at ember/angular.
[02:10:35] <ph88> i didnt like angular because you got to have stuff in your html
[02:10:43] <ph88> stuff for angular to work
[02:11:04] <ph88> and ember im not quite sure why i didnt like it but i think it was too big
[02:11:11] <ph88> my second choice would be Knockout
[02:11:23] <systemfault> I also looked at it
[02:11:57] <motaka2> Is this line correct to check if a js is already loaded?    if ($("script[src='" + data.jsPaths[cssCounter] + "']").length === 0)
[02:12:16] <systemfault> Eww
[02:12:19] <ph88> cssCounter o_O
[02:12:38] <systemfault> motaka2: Why don't you check if the wanted function/object is loaded instead ?
[02:13:06] <motaka2> ph88: YesI've fixed that but not working yet
[02:13:20] <motaka2> systemfault: What do you mean?
[02:13:51] <systemfault> Well.. I can check on my page if jQuery is loaded by simply doing If (jQuery) ?
[02:13:55] <systemfault> -?
[02:20:14] <ne2k> I'm new to jquery, although I know about programming in general. I've read an intro and get the basic concept. I've currently got a page with lots of hyperlinks of the form <a href="report?file=20130618-1900">TEXT</a> and I'd like to replace them all with popups using http://file.urin.take-uma.net/jquery.balloon.js-Demo.html or similar
[02:20:27] <JohnnyCache> question: is there any way to hide the arrow in a dropdown select box?
[02:20:57] <Cork> JohnnyCache: no, you can't really style it at all
[02:21:16] <JohnnyCache> any way to work it our easily?
[02:21:18] <JohnnyCache> out
[02:21:37] <JohnnyCache> you know any plugin maybe?
[02:21:39] <Cork> JohnnyCache: you would have to replace them with javascript widgets
[02:22:06] <ph88> Cork: do you know how i can get the jQuery ui Transfer effect and Scale effect simultaniously ?
[02:22:27] <ne2k> I was thinking that I could replace each <a> with a <span> with an id that was equal to the file= parameter, and then apply .balloon({ url: report?file=$file }) to all of them. does this seem like a sensible approach? what's the best way to go about matching them all?
[02:22:36] <Cork> ph88: no, haven't used the animations from ui much
[02:22:43] <ph88> oki
[02:23:43] <Cork> ne2k: why not just something like $(document).on('hover', 'a', function() { $(this).baloon({ url: $(this).attr('href') }); })
[02:24:21] <Cork> ne2k: that way it works without js, and works inline with js
[02:24:27] <ne2k> Cork: ah, perfect. I was wondering how I would get the href for each of them. $(this) is what I need
[02:28:45] <ne2k> Cork: can I get it to toggle on click instead of hovering using a similar command?
[02:29:04] <Cork> s/hover/click/ in the code i gave you?
[02:29:23] <ne2k> Cork: but that won't hide it if I click again, though, will it?
[02:29:41] <ne2k> hang on, let me try it first and see where I get to
[02:33:30] <thekindlyone> can someone here take a look at this? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17196378/detect-scroll-to-bottom-on-dynamic-page
[02:36:23] <ph88> how can i save a bunch of css properties of an element to restore them later ?
[02:39:16] <thekindlyone> ph88 , you can toggle class on an element.. that doesnt fix your problem/
[02:39:55] <ph88> well if i can use animate() toward a class ?
[02:40:13] <lcains> Hi all is there anyone that can help me fix an anooying bug please?
[02:40:27] <ph88> maybe i ought to split the class in properties which can (and should) be animated and properties who should remain the same
[02:42:16] <thekindlyone> scroll to bottom works here http://jsfiddle.net/jkh5P/
[02:42:16] <thekindlyone> but not here http://dodomain.uni.me/rss.html where the div contents are loaded with ajax . Help/
[02:44:13] <lcains> can anyone tell me the easiest way to prevent a function being called more than once in quick succession. I have a slideshow that mostly works but if I click to select another slideshow, it seems to ignore the timeout and just call over and over
[02:48:25] <lcains> anyone at all see my predicament?
[02:54:03] <DrMabuse> Hi anyone use gmap3 and can tell me how i can change the cluster radius on the fly ?
[02:57:01] <ne2k> Cork: I've put this in the header $(document).ready(function() { $(document).on('hover', 'a', function() { $(this).balloon({ url: $(this).attr('href') }); }) })(); but I'm not getting any action when I hover. does this look right? I can see the <a>s have a hover Event Listener. can you help me understand how the $(document).on(...) thing works?
[02:57:57] <Cork> remove the last ()
[02:58:15] <Cork> `api on
[02:58:15] <b-ot> Cork: .on(): Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[02:58:22] <Cork> ne2k: also read that ^
[02:58:33] <ne2k> thanks
[03:00:40] <ne2k> Cork: am I right in thinking that this is calling .balloon whenever I hover? I don't think that's right. I think .balloon is meant to be called once, to set up the handler
[03:00:54] <Cork> hmm
[03:01:04] <ne2k> e.g. $('#sample1 a').balloon();
[03:01:05] <Cork> ne2k: do you have the link to the plugin again?
[03:01:10] <ne2k> http://file.urin.take-uma.net/jquery.balloon.js-Demo.html
[03:01:43] <Cork> ah
[03:02:08] <Cork> use showBalloon/hideBalloon instead
[03:02:46] <ne2k> I think I want $('a').each(function() { $(this).balloon({ url: $(this).attr('href') }) }
[03:03:02] <ne2k> does that sound right?
[03:03:03] <Cork> $(document).ready(function() { $(document).on('mouseenter', 'a', function() { $(this).showBalloon({ url: $(this).attr('href') }); }).on('mouseleave', 'a', function() { $(this).hideBalloon(); }) })
[03:03:20] <Cork> ne2k: it adds a lot of unneeded listeners to the page
[03:03:28] <Cork> and if you later add new links those wont work
[03:04:46] <ne2k> Cork: is the .on('mouseleave'...) just concatenated on the end? that looks odd
[03:05:05] <Cork> ne2k: what do you mean?
[03:05:28] <Cork> .on('mouseenter', function() {}).on('mouseleave', function() {});
[03:05:37] <rockwood> Cork i have checked it all at my level but i am unsucessful
[03:06:03] <Cork> rockwood: sorry have forgotten the problem
[03:06:12] <ne2k> Cork: yeah, that looks strange. I would have expected to have to apply those separately. so you can cascade .ons
[03:06:14] <rockwood> LOL
[03:06:20] <Cork> rockwood: was it the br problem?
[03:06:28] <rockwood> no
[03:06:40] <rockwood> .load page A page B
[03:06:44] <Cork> ah
[03:07:09] <Cork> ne2k: no check the documentations for the selector arguments (second in the code i gave you)
[03:07:26] <rockwood> temprature increased in my mind
[03:07:30] <Cork> rockwood: content.load(url, function() { $() })
[03:07:40] <Cork> that is what you should do
[03:07:49] <Cork> ther $() is the $('selector').submit()
[03:08:11] <rockwood> ok checking
[03:08:18] <rockwood> hi anew
[03:08:26] <anew> hello
[03:09:16] <ne2k> Cork: I'm spacing out the code so I can get my head around all the brackets
[03:09:23] <Lucaszz> Hi I have problem with jquery dialog modal
[03:09:32] <Lucaszz> i have list with buttons
[03:09:44] <Lucaszz> list is very long
[03:10:09] <Cork> ne2k: $(document).on('event', 'selector', function() {})
[03:10:09] <Lucaszz> when I click buttonfrom item on the botttom of list jquery dialog gets wrong position
[03:10:31] <Cork> ne2k: selector is the element you're targeting $() is the element you bind the event listener on
[03:11:56] <ne2k> Cork: yeah, the event listener is being bound to document, I get that. I just don't see how you can do $(document).on(...).on(...);
[03:12:49] <Cork> ne2k: most jquery function returns the original jquery object
[03:12:56] <Cork> so you can dacy chain them
[03:13:08] <ne2k> Cork: ok, that's what I was getting at. thanks
[03:13:12] <ph88> why doesnt this fiddle work ? it works on my own website ... http://jsfiddle.net/GxMTB/1/
[03:14:20] <Cork> ph88: works fine here
[03:14:37] <ph88> o_O
[03:15:25] <ph88> Cork:  oh yeah it does work in another browser. But there is a bug ... the second time you click the dialog button the start position is wrong
[03:16:25] <ph88> any idea why that is ?
[03:17:50] <Cork> ph88: you should prob not set height/width through css()
[03:17:58] <Cork> use .height/.width instead
[03:18:05] <ph88> Cork:  i let me try
[03:18:13] <Cork> if you still want to set it through .css make sure you define the units
[03:18:27] <Cork> same goes for left/top too though
[03:19:24] <ph88> Cork:  didn't help http://jsfiddle.net/GxMTB/2/  ... i will try with width() and height() now
[03:19:34] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/GxMTB/3/
[03:20:15] <ne2k> Cork: I've got it working. thanks for your help. when I change "mouseenter" to "click", the <a> takes over and it goes to the other page. is there an easy way to override this?
[03:20:59] <Cork> ph88: also you prob want to use outerWidth not width http://jsfiddle.net/GxMTB/5/
[03:21:04] <ph88> Cork:  d0h moment, stupid i forgot the margin :|
[03:21:19] <Cork> ph88: you forgot quite a bit of things :)
[03:21:22] <ph88> true
[03:21:53] <Cork> ph88: also you might want to check css3 transform, that would make this quite a bit simpler and smoother
[03:22:05] <Cork> it depends on what compatibility you need though
[03:23:04] <ph88> so i just set the css and no animate() anymore
[03:23:25] <ph88> i still need to specify a duration somewhere ...
[03:23:30] <Cork> you set and remove the css yes
[03:23:41] <Cork> ?p mdn transision
[03:23:50] <Cork> opps
[03:23:52] <Cork> ?g mdn transision
[03:23:53] <b-ot> Cork: transition - CSS | MDN → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transition
[03:25:00] <ne2k> Cork: the hover thing is being weird, it seems to keep disappearing and reappearing when I move the mouse. I guess the balloon is appearing on top of the <a> which means the mouse is going into /it/ and leaving the <a>, causing it to hide it.
[03:25:33] <Cork> ne2k: it would help if you could create fiddle of what you're doing
[03:25:43] <ne2k> fiddle?
[03:25:52] <Cork> jsfiddle.net
[03:26:03] <Cork> a working online demo of the problem
[03:26:28] <ne2k> thanks. for now I've just set the position to bottom so it appears below it
[03:26:41] <ne2k> but that's no good when it's at the bottom of the page
[03:27:03] <ne2k> because the balloon appears off the bottom
[03:28:08] <Guest27314> hi
[03:28:32] <ph88> Cork:  do you think i should use Scale & Translate with that instead of width/height & top/left ?
[03:28:47] <Guest27314> anyone know how to proper bind on('click' event on a element in the header of jquery accordion ?
[03:29:13] <Cork> ph88: it should basically be the same thing; so it is up to you
[03:29:28] <Guest27314> i've tried stoppropagation(), changed the default event to mouseup
[03:29:44] <Guest27314> without success
[03:30:00] <Cork> Guest27314: check what events jquery ui uses, and make sure to run stopPropagation in that event
[03:30:39] <Guest27314> jq ui use 'click'
[03:31:13] <Cork> then $('your element').on('click', function(event) { event.stopPropagation(); }); should work just fine
[03:31:15] <Guest27314> then on the init of init param of accordion i've changed it by that : event:"mouseup"
[03:31:42] <Cork> could you make an example of you're problem?
[03:31:47] <Cork> jsfiddle.net
[03:31:56] <Guest27314> yep
[03:37:44] <Guest27314> http://jsfiddle.net/VSVG6/
[03:37:55] <Guest27314> i want to make a close button
[03:38:08] <Guest27314> to fadeout the clicked slide
[03:38:31] <Guest27314> i use jquery 1.9.1 with migrate plugin
[03:39:00] <Guest27314> and http://code.jquery.com/ui/1.10.3/jquery-ui.js
[03:39:33] <Cork> what would a.tool have to do with the span?
[03:39:46] <Guest27314> oh
[03:39:47] <Guest27314> sry
[03:40:07] <Guest27314> a.tool forget to replace that...
[03:40:15] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/VSVG6/1/
[03:40:18] <Guest27314> it must be h3 > span
[03:40:54] <Cork> well http://jsfiddle.net/VSVG6/1/ works :)
[03:41:39] <Cork> Guest27314: also you can't set !important in inline css
[03:42:03] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/VSVG6/3/
[03:43:22] <ne2k> using this balloon library http://file.urin.take-uma.net/jquery.balloon.js-Demo.html can anyone help me work out how to change the default opacity of all balloons? I've tried $.balloon.defaults.css = but I think that completely overwrites the whole CSS; I just want to change one property
[03:43:54] <ne2k> (I'm a jquery noob, btw, sorry if this is obvious)
[03:44:23] <Guest27314> thanks Cork
[03:44:40] <Guest27314> but when i apply the stoppropagation in my real code
[03:44:50] <Guest27314> it seem's to fail :(
[03:45:29] <Guest27314> i use d3.js , it can be a conflict ?

[04:04:38] * rockwood asking cork http://jsfiddle.net/Tqm7u/3/  it is showing $this is undifined in console log
[04:09:26] <mrHAT> ok, so i have a string which i need to split into smaller chunks. each chunck must have a max of 40 chars including spaces and must not end/start with cut word, how can i do this ?
[04:10:30] <ne2k> mrHAT: "must not end/start with cut word" -- can you explain in more detail what you mean by this?
[04:10:46] <ne2k> mrHAT: this sounds rather like word-wrapping
[04:12:01] <mrHAT> well.. i´ve done this function in php maybe that helps better explain ?
[04:12:43] <ne2k> mrHAT: be clearer
[04:13:01] <mrHAT> http://pastebin.com/DnGj0LFH
[04:13:09] <mrHAT> i have no ideea how to illustrate what i need
[04:13:12] <mrHAT> heh
[04:14:15] <mrHAT> so i have a paragraph that´s 412 chars long and i need to split that into smaller lines of max chars each
[04:14:19] <Logi> What's a good way to allow dragging a div around the page (within certain bounds) if I don't want to import jquery-UI?
[04:14:43] <Logi> I keep seeing lists og 30 plugins for d&d and, well... I only need one :)
[04:14:48] <Logi> Or do I?
[04:14:53] <ne2k> mrHAT: it's called word-wrapping. why would you want to do this in jquery? why not just let the browser do its thing and wrap lines?
[04:15:12] <mrHAT> i need to format a string that cames from ajax
[04:15:28] <mrHAT> and pass that string to a java applet
[04:15:38] <mrHAT> as ZPL formatted code
[04:15:45] <ne2k> mrHAT: what does trim() do?
[04:16:02] <rockwood> cork can you check once for me where i am making mistake ?
[04:16:03] <Logi> ne2k: it says in the documentation...
[04:16:13] <mrHAT> cuts spaces, tabs, new lines from end/start of styring
[04:16:20] <Cork> rockwood: sorry i have things i have to take care of
[04:16:30] <ne2k> Logi: why would I want to start looking up the documentation of some random language that has nothing to do with the channel topic?
[04:16:58] <ph88> Cork: what am i doing wrong here with the transition? http://jsfiddle.net/nbf6J/
[04:17:07] <mrHAT> ne2k i could probably port that function to js... but i was wondering if its a better way to do it
[04:17:11] <mrHAT> simpler way
[04:17:17] <Logi> ne2k: If you're the one helping out, you wouldn't. If you're the one asking quesitons, to not bother people. I just arrived, so I don
[04:17:26] <Logi> 't know which scenario we're in here.
[04:18:29] <ne2k> Logi: well, maybe think before you say something next time, then
[04:18:48] <Logi> ne2k: I love you too. *smooooch*
[04:19:31] <ne2k> mrHAT: I don't know what ZPL is. do you have control over the ajax source?
[04:19:44] <mrHAT> yes
[04:20:08] <ne2k> mrHAT: maybe make it output the text in the correct format instead, then? it seems like an odd thing to do to do word-wrapping in jQuery
[04:20:36] <ph88> hey guys in this fiddle  http://jsfiddle.net/GxMTB/3/  ... it works but if you click Dialog quickly before waiting for the animation to complete it wont animate anymore on the next click ... why is that ?
[04:20:43] <rockwood> i can understand but i am very near the completion . Please try to spare some time
[04:21:08] <rockwood> it will take only 5-10 minutes for you
[04:21:25] <ph88> rockwood: can you take a look at that fiddle ?
[04:21:30] <ne2k> mrHAT: what happens if the first word is 40 characters long?
[04:22:36] <ne2k> he disappeared
[04:23:53] <ph88> someone killd mrHat
[04:29:12] <defk0n> what does this do? (function($) { something something })(jQuery);??
[04:30:26] <Eviltwin> It means that for something something $ will be jQuery
[04:30:35] <Eviltwin> Even if somewhere outside you redefine $ to be something else
[04:30:45] <Eviltwin> It's called a closure
[04:31:02] <defk0n> hm, oke
[04:31:08] <defk0n> does it work with all versions of jquery?
[04:31:24] <Eviltwin> Yes
[04:31:37] <Eviltwin> And all versions of JavaScript for that matter

[05:02:34] <moldy> the last line here give me a ReferenceError: django is not defined. should i care, or rather ignore this?
[05:04:21] <sacho>  "the last line here"?
[05:05:15] <moldy> sacho: ah, sorry :) https://github.com/theatlantic/django-chosen/blob/master/chosen/static/js/chosen.jquery_ready.js
[05:06:27] <sacho> how are you using that script?
[05:07:06] <moldy> sacho: it's being included with a <script> tag
[05:07:18] <sammich> what other good web dev channels are out there?
[05:07:37] <moldy> sammich: depends on what you're looking for. #css, for example.
[05:07:54] <sammich> general topics really
[05:08:11] <sammich> somewhere I can ask for opinions for more specific frameworks
[05:08:12] <sacho> General topics aren't suited well for irc.
[05:08:22] <sammich> I don't mean that general
[05:08:33] <moldy> sammich: #javascript then
[05:08:45] <moldy> sacho: my current understanding is that the referenceerror is raised by window.django not being defined, but to be honest, i am not sure
[05:08:50] <sacho> sammich, I think you're looking for a forum.
[05:09:13] <sacho> moldy, no.
[05:09:15] <sammich> hmm
[05:09:30] <sacho> moldy, django.jQuery would be the reference error.
[05:10:10] <sammich> maybe I'm asking the wrong question. I guess I'm looking for places where web devs congregate (over IRC) but hopefully none too specific
[05:10:31] <moldy> sacho: is that evaluated even when (typeof window.django != 'undefined') is true?
[05:10:46] <moldy> errr, false
[05:10:51] <sacho> no
[05:10:59] <moldy> hm, that is weird
[05:11:35] <harshamv> i am using a jquery plugin for filterable portfolio. the transition seems to be wierd because of some reason. any idea how to solve this. http://sophiance.com/v2/#viewSection
[05:11:40] <sacho> use a debugger and find out what's wrong.
[05:12:07] <moldy> sacho: hrm, the error is gone. weird.
[05:12:44] <harshamv> sacho: there is no error. jsut the transition is wierd
[05:12:53] <harshamv> am sorry was that for me?
[05:13:24] <CptCaptain> Can someone help me with this fiddle (http://jsfiddle.net/4ypHp/3/)? It should show a plus button butt it shows nothing.
[05:14:09] <sacho> harshamv, no, it was for moldy.
[05:14:21] <harshamv> sacho: no issues
[05:15:01] <LittleBuster> sacho: as it is jquery related, I'll continue here
[05:15:20] <sacho> Your question isn't really jquery related either.
[05:16:46] <e563e57> Hi is there anyway to remove the paddings for the buttons in the header
[05:17:22] <sacho> "the buttons in the header"?
[05:17:45] <sammich> $('*').css('padding', 0) should do it
[05:19:24] <AdamPDotty> Cpt read again about append()!
[05:21:00] <LittleBuster> sacho, seems I get it so far. The only thing remaining is, The Value is displayed in double quotes. "666" instead of 666
[05:21:14] <sacho> ..what?
[05:21:39] <sacho> "the value" "is displayed" explain those
[05:22:18] <LittleBuster> the output i've expected was 666, but I'm getting "666" with those quotation marks
[05:24:14] <shoky> CptCaptain: dont ask me why but it works with a .trigger('create')  http://jsfiddle.net/4ypHp/4/  tho maybe AdamPDotty has more to say
[05:25:01] <sacho> LittleBuster, how are you getting it?
[05:27:14] <LittleBuster> sacho: http://pastebin.com/uMiqaffk
[05:29:14] <sacho> What's the response you are getting from myscript.php?
[05:30:46] <LittleBuster> sacho: 666
[05:30:52] <CptCaptain> AdamPDotty: What do you mean? It does exactly what I want.
[05:33:00] <sacho> LittleBuster, that's impossible.
[05:34:48] <LittleBuster> why=
[05:35:05] <LittleBuster> PHP has as output 666, javascript "666"
[05:36:15] * sacho sighs
[05:36:24] <sacho> do you have a test page where you can demonstrate this?
[05:38:08] <LittleBuster> unfortunally not, as it runs just company internal
[05:38:55] <sacho> Well, fix your http response.
[05:39:12] <shoky> LittleBuster: are you looking at the actual response in the browser's devtools' network tab?
[05:40:37] <shoky> and where are you seeing the quotes
[05:41:12] <LittleBuster> shoky: i see the quotes in the browser.
[05:41:44] <shoky> LittleBuster: it'd help to give a more precise answer..
[05:41:55] <shoky> i know you're not seeing it in your food
[05:42:34] <shoky> and you didn't answer my first q
[05:46:51] <CptCaptain> http://jsfiddle.net/4ypHp/8/ Why isn't the button on the right side? I added ui-btn-right.
[05:48:16] <LittleBuster> shoky: I think I'll start at 0. Any goot tutorials about JS ans PHP ... ajax?
[05:48:44] <shoky> LittleBuster: i donno PHP, so no tuts from me sry
[05:49:35] <LittleBuster> shoky: otherwise any good javascript tut
[05:50:31] <nawk> http://jsfiddle.net/GWELB/1/
[05:51:43] <nawk> I am new to JQuery and I need to understand what's going on line 26
[05:51:55] <nawk> $(this).find("p").fadeIn().fadeOut();
[05:53:01] <shoky> LittleBuster https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide   http://eloquentjavascript.net/
[05:53:53] <nawk> I understand that fadeIn() method will be run on the list of matched elements
[05:56:12] <zulu-gula> I would like to replace element content when it's load by ajax - how can I?
[05:56:25] <nawk> my question is, which object type does the method .fadeOut() belong to?
[05:56:47] <shoky> nawk: a jquery object. same as fadeIn()
[05:57:02] <sacho> nawk, most non-filter functions return the jquery collection they operate on
[05:57:09] <e563e57> sammich what should be in the * field as u noted it?
[05:57:28] <juakm> Hello, why doesn't this hover animate work? http://jsfiddle.net/kU7Lj/1/
[05:57:47] <dangerousdave> If i have the following code:   dialog = $('a.dialog');   Is there a problem having it run for every page, even if for some pages, that element does not exist?
[05:58:19] <shoky> juakm: you can't animate non-numeric properties without some special plugin
[05:58:20] <sacho> dangerousdave, do you do anything with dialog afterward?
[05:59:11] <dangerousdave> sacho: the pages that do something with dialog, have that element
[05:59:29] <juakm> shoky: so what do I need?
[05:59:36] <shoky> juakm: you need jquery-ui  or  https://github.com/jquery/jquery-color/
[06:00:14] <sacho> dangerousdave, then no, it's not a problem.
[06:00:22] <sacho> although why you need this is beyond me.
[06:00:43] <dangerousdave> sacho: is there an overhead? is this common practice?
[06:00:53] <dangerousdave> sacho: my problem is....
[06:02:03] <sacho> "this"?
[06:02:08] <nawk> shoky, sacho,  that helps. So, what you are saying in most cases, except for *some filter functions, what's returned from methods after $(...) is a jquery collection object.
[06:02:25] <sacho> nawk, specifically, the same object you called the previous method on
[06:02:56] <sacho> nawk, you're being misled by the $(selector) part. That's simply a function which also returns a jquery collection.
[06:06:00] <nawk> sacho: thanks, I think I see what's going on; somewhat of a pipeline of filters
[06:06:08] <juakm> shoky: thank you. Now it works with the UI. However, can I run this hover function on all but the "active" elements. The mouse out action removes the active css properties regarding color.
[06:06:17] <juakm> if this is id active = dont do
[06:06:20] <juakm> something like that
[06:07:49] <juakm> yees yeees
[06:09:12] <dangerousdave> I thought i would then set a variable to this element, so if the element name later changed, I would only have to change it once in code....
[06:09:49] <dangerousdave> sacho: however now I have the problem where the variable is set for pages that don't have that element.
[06:10:17] <sacho> why is it a problem?
[06:12:16] <dangerousdave> sacho: well, maybe its not, i just don't know how best to structure my code to allow sharing between functions that are used on every page, and those that are only used on a single page.
[06:12:39] <dangerousdave> by sharing i mean accessing the same elements
[06:13:21] <sacho> um, that really depends on how you've structured the rest of your code. I think you've kind of railroaded yourself into using a global variable, when it's not necessarily needed
[06:15:38] <sacho> So your problem is, you want to separate selecting the element from using it, which is a good idea. But why can't the components that are using it have an initializer which selects the element?
[06:16:40] <sacho> you could transform your question generally into "how do I manage dependencies", to which you can find better information by googling
[06:17:35] <Meteorskies> hello
[06:17:35] <Meteorskies> I'd like some help
[06:17:36] <Meteorskies> I'm fairly new with jquery and I don't really understand how a selector works with a context
[06:17:47] <Meteorskies> here is what I have
[06:17:52] <Meteorskies> var group = $('button[name="foo"]');
[06:17:53] <Meteorskies> var groupActive = $('.active',group);
[06:18:08] <Meteorskies> what I'm trying to do is get all the buttons named "foo" with the class "active" in groupActive
[06:18:18] <Meteorskies> but apparently it doesn't work
[06:18:23] <Meteorskies> when I test the first element of groupActive I get "undefined"
[06:18:30] <dangerousdave> sacho: an initialiser that sets one variable?
[06:18:35] <sammich> I think you're looking for the filter() method
[06:18:40] <dangerousdave> sacho: thanks, will google
[06:19:13] <sammich> Meteorskies: http://api.jquery.com/filter/
[06:19:18] <Meteorskies> possibly, what should I used the slector context for then?
[06:19:32] <sacho> When you want to search within a certain context instead of the whole document.
[06:19:45] <Meteorskies> isn't it what I do?
[06:19:59] <sammich> your 'group' selection is just a list of objects
[06:20:14] <Meteorskies> ah, so it is not considered a context then?
[06:20:18] <sammich> a context is a single DOM node that jQuery looks under
[06:20:34] <Meteorskies> ah, got it
[06:20:48] <sammich> for a selector. Context also has other meaning when referring to scope
[06:20:55] <sammich> loosely
[06:21:06] <Meteorskies> I see
[06:21:35] <Meteorskies> many thanks
[06:21:40] <sammich> nw
[06:24:30] <Steve^> Is there any way to download jQuery UI 1.8.19?
[06:26:00] <shoky> Steve^: http://code.jquery.com/
[06:26:44] <seutje> quick google shows multiple download mirrors still around
[06:26:51] <Eviltwin> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/tree/1.8.19
[06:27:03] <Steve^> ah, thanks
[06:27:32] <Steve^> Do you think there will be a way of creating a new custom 1.8.19 build?
[06:27:45] <kborchers> Steve^: just keep in mind there have been _A LOT_ of bugs fixed since 1.8.19
[06:28:48] <Steve^> yea, just looking through the changelogs, maybe I'll upgrade
[06:29:51] <e563e57> In jquery mobile im trying to use ONLY an image as button, but jquery keeps adding some stuff around it, like padding, and shadows and stuff
[06:30:20] <sammich> you can disable it, hold on
[06:31:17] <arschmitz> e563e57: do you mean like an input type="image"
[06:31:36] <sammich> data-enhance=false on your element
[06:31:53] <sammich> http://api.jquerymobile.com/data-attribute/ under 'enhancement'
[06:32:12] <Guest27314> a.tool forget to replace that.../j #Cork
[06:32:16] <Guest27314> ops
[06:32:19] <Guest27314> wc
[06:32:54] <arschmitz> i would not recomend data-enhance="false" to use this you must use $.mobile.ignoreContentEnabled which is bad for performance
[06:33:01] <arschmitz> use data-role="none"
[06:33:21] <sammich> there you go. I've only used jQM for like 5 days
[06:33:32] <sammich> 4 actually, started a new project
[06:34:01] <arschmitz> sammich: cool data-enhance="false" is for use on all children of an element
[06:34:38] <arschmitz> but problem is every element that gets enhance we first have to traverse all the way up the dom tree to make sure no parent has data-enhance="false" set on it
[06:34:59] <sammich> ah, true
[06:35:02] <arschmitz> thats why its disabled by default
[06:35:26] <sammich> so role is just the one element?
[06:35:35] <arschmitz> yup
[06:36:05] <e563e57> arschmitz, no just like a data button in jquery mobile
[06:36:07] <e563e57> ordinary button
[06:36:26] <arschmitz> you cant use data-role="button" but not get buttons enhancement
[06:36:56] <arschmitz> the point of data-role="button" is to specificly give those styles
[06:37:06] <sammich> this is just a 2 week project in jQM, I was gonna build it from scratch, but last minute I jumped to jQM
[06:37:59] <arschmitz> sammich: cool it makes a small simple project easy looks good out of the box
[06:38:05] <sammich> it's going to be such a hack job
[06:38:18] <arschmitz> lol
[06:38:30] <sammich> I'm really only using jQM for the layout and styles
[06:38:38] <sammich> not any of the paging or transitions
[06:38:55] <sammich> so hoping none of it blows up in my face
[06:39:00] <arschmitz> sammich: you can do a custom build and exclude the nav
[06:40:02] <themojowill> afternoon, I am using Select2 to dynamically populate a dropdwon box based on a AJAX request, the following code is to show a preview button based on the selected data, it works first time, but if I select another option in the dropdown it doesn't fire?? https://gist.github.com/mojowill/5822753
[06:40:07] <sammich> jqm sites are really slow here :|
[06:40:37] <arschmitz> sammich: its designed so you dont need to use the nav or transitions if you dont want them i would just do a build with out and set the approriate init settings
[06:41:10] <sammich> ah, I'll have to investigate this
[06:41:20] <sammich> cheers
[06:41:29] <arschmitz> sammich: yeah right now the page enhancement can be slow we are doing a lot to fix that in the next version
[06:41:42] <sammich> didn't really consider it because I wasn't sure what components I'd be needing
[06:42:14] <sammich> so you work on jqm?
[06:42:19] <arschmitz> sammich: http://jquerymobile.com/download-builder/
[06:42:26] <sammich> yeah, I'm looking at it now
[06:42:27] <arschmitz> yes im one of the developers
[06:44:09] <sammich> okay, this might not be 'kosher' but I think (read: no idea really) I'm trying to build 'MVC' (?) thingy
[06:44:20] <sammich> not sure of the terminology here
[06:44:44] <arschmitz> ok
[06:45:04] <sammich> but there are pages of forms, and I'm writing out the selection options back into a big object holding the state of the data
[06:45:23] <sammich> and then updating the relevant elements to show the new selection
[06:45:51] <sammich> inputs, sliders, buttons have listeners for click, vclick, tap etc
[06:46:07] <sammich> but radio controlgroups don't
[06:46:25] <sammich> I mean, they have click, obviously
[06:46:30] <sammich> but that doesn't cut it for mobile
[06:46:42] <dangerousdave> shoky: *returned from googling* would a good solution then be to create a very small function that sets a single global variable, which is called from both functions?
[06:46:46] <arschmitz> the best way to handle updates on form controls is to change the value then trigger("change");
[06:47:13] <arschmitz> all the form widgets listen for change to keep state
[06:47:13] <sammich> atm, yes, it's horrible, I know, I just update the whole page :|
[06:47:33] <therealkoopa> Does anyone know if jquery has anything similar to yui valuechange (http://yuilibrary.com/yui/docs/event/valuechange.html)
[06:47:52] <arschmitz> sammich: i think triggering change on the native element after you change the value is your best bet
[06:48:19] <sammich> lemme find my work, one sec
[06:51:59] <sammich> alright, might be a gap in my understanding
[06:52:28] <sammich> so I have a table, and I put a checkbox in the last col
[06:52:46] <sammich> and I made it so if I click on the row, it'll toggle the checkbox
[06:53:06] <sammich> but I can't attach a 'tap' to the tr
[06:53:50] <arschmitz> ok
[06:54:06] <arschmitz> so when you try to attach the event to a tr it never gets fired
[06:54:16] <sammich> as in $().on('tap', '#myTable tr', function () { /* click checkbox below tr */ });
[06:55:07] <shoky> dangerousdave: i think you meant to ping sacho ;P  i'd be happy to help too if you repeat the issue
[06:55:19] <sammich> atm I'm using 'click' for them all, I want to use 'tap/vclick' for them all
[06:55:39] <sammich> using tap/click just means I get dupe events on the native tap-listening elements
[06:56:32] <sammich> I use a single variable to hold the attach event for all the 'on's so I just have it set to 'click' for now
[06:56:47] <gxl> .on() works on future created elements too, right?
[06:56:52] <sammich> yeah
[06:57:06] <shoky> gxl: depends how it's used
[06:57:07] <arschmitz> sammich: ok just give me a second
[06:57:12] <sammich> cheers
[06:57:54] <sammich> I'm still being lazy and using $('body') for everything :|
[06:58:43] <gxl> shoky, I had a jshowoff control button bound to manipulate some css on click and it worked. Then all of a sudden the on() click listener for the button doesn't work. I can't do anything to the jshowoff controls anymore. I'm scratching my head.
[06:59:59] <tabi> any one knows about jquery tabs with lightbox usage?
[07:00:10] <shoky> gxl: no idea what a jshowoff control is. make a jsfiddle/demo of your problem
[07:00:34] <tabi> any one?
[07:00:47] <gxl> tabi: I've used lightbox in tabs before.
[07:00:52] <tabi> any strong developper?
[07:01:05] <dangerousdave> getting set for pages that did not have that element.
[07:01:18] <arschmitz> sammich: http://jsbin.com/uzaret/852/edit tap works on a tr
[07:01:21] <tabi> can u give me suggeseion
[07:01:35] <arschmitz> sammich: so it must be something else
[07:02:06] <tabi> i am using tabs with light box popup but it not working
[07:02:07] <sammich> herm
[07:02:13] <sammich> okay, lemme check that out
[07:02:49] <tabi> any one plz?
[07:03:14] <tabi> @ <gxl> can u?
[07:03:27] <sammich> arschmitz: what's the mobile.doc.on? is there a difference in usage?
[07:03:40] <gxl> tabi: What is the problem that you are having?
[07:03:55] <arschmitz> just a shortcut really its the same as $(document).on
[07:04:25] <arschmitz> we save a refrence to the document and window on the mobile object to avoide running the selector repeatedly
[07:04:35] <arschmitz> improves performance a bit
[07:04:49] <tabi> i am using tab in simple page cover with a div then call it in to lightbox it shows tabs but not the forms which are creating in those div
[07:05:23] <sammich> ah crap, sorry
[07:05:46] <arschmitz> sammich: no problem i use it out of habit
[07:05:48] <sammich> I mean, I have a control group with radio buttons, and I'm trying to bind to tap
[07:06:05] <sammich> is there just a change event on that group?
[07:07:02] <sammich> because I've gotten around to bind to the .ui-radio label element under
[07:07:06] <arschmitz> sammich: lol ok so which is it a checkbox in a table or a radio in a control group lol
[07:07:33] <sammich> apologies again. I've been off project for unrelated work training for a week :|
[07:07:56] <arschmitz> no problem
[07:08:26] <arschmitz> ok so you have a control group you update which one is selected then you need to perform a visual update?
[07:09:03] <tabi> no one helping me
[07:09:10] <sammich> lemme setup a fiddle to save me the embarrasment
[07:09:14] <tabi> no oe helping me :(
[07:09:50] <tabi> no one helping me from that common issue?
[07:09:55] <tabi> is there no one ?
[07:10:08] <shoky> tabi: stop spamming. make a demo of your problem
[07:10:21] <jedimind> WONT SOMEBODY THINK OF THE CHILDREN!?
[07:10:25] <gxl> tabi: You have to be specific or show example of your issue.
[07:11:10] <arschmitz> sammich no problem
[07:11:43] <ajmrsn> hello, I've got some javascript experience and some jquery experience (with the api etc) but I'm looking at someone else's jquery mobile code.  It looks slightly different… is this a workable syntax?  http://dpaste.com/1256838/  I mean the pages do function but they're very buggy.
[07:13:25] <arschmitz> ajmrsn: not really
[07:13:41] <arschmitz> by binding to page before show those will get bound every time the page is shown
[07:13:53] <arschmitz> so view the page twice and now those handlers will fire twice
[07:13:57] <tabi> is there any documentation for using tabs with lightbox?
[07:14:13] <ajmrsn> arschmitz: excellent… I need to redo this person's entire code
[07:14:22] <arschmitz> ajmrsn: to avoid this you should bind to pageinit instead of pagebeforeshow
[07:14:36] <tabi> how can i make a demo ok i am putting my code in paste bin ?
[07:14:37] <arschmitz> pageinit only happens when the page is enhanced
[07:14:39] <ajmrsn> thank you, I'll start converting all that
[07:14:41] <arschmitz> so once per page
[07:14:44] <ajmrsn> oh
[07:14:59] <ajmrsn> ok, I think I got that
[07:15:09] <sammich> arschmitz: okay, here it is http://jsfiddle.net/d4U2p/
[07:15:11] <arschmitz> ajmrsn: should be a simple fix replace pagebeforeshow with pageinit

[07:23:20] <toddWork__> i have this selector : $('.threshold-container .arrow', this.el).
[07:23:30] <toddWork__> but i'd like to add '.button'
[07:23:35] <toddWork__> to it in the same context.
[07:23:59] <toddWork__> so, select both .arrow AND .button of the this.el .threshold-container
[07:24:24] <toddWork__> how should i do that?
[07:25:05] <shoky> toddWork__:  $(this.el).find('.threshold-container').find('.arrow, .button')  i suppose
[07:25:41] <toddWork__> shoky: ok. thanks
[07:27:19] <sammich> arschmitz: just wanna let you know I have to go soon, if you're still having a look
[07:27:58] <arschmitz> sammich: i am looking
[07:28:17] <sammich> thanks
[07:30:12] <arschmitz> sammich: i simplified your example a bit
[07:30:32] <arschmitz> but is there a reason this would not work http://jsfiddle.net/d4U2p/5/
[07:31:33] <sammich> oh. see I didn't save myself from embarrassment
[07:31:51] <sammich> one of those things you miss when you work on stuff for too long

[07:42:23] <kraftcc> Anybody know much about jQuery Mobile?
[07:44:07] <arschmitz> kraftcc: im one of the developers of jQuery Mobile how can i help you?
[07:48:11] <holymacaroons> I'm trying to trigger an onclick event after the page loads in jquery but it's not working. Does anyone know how to get it working?
[07:48:28] <holymacaroons> $(function(){
[07:48:28] <holymacaroons> 		$('#clickme').trigger('click');
[07:48:28] <holymacaroons> 	});
[07:48:35] <loopsdeer> holymacaroons: jsfiddle.net your question
[07:49:30] <kraftcc> arschmitz: I'm experiencing a lot of bugs such as the control groups that aren't automatically initialized and their corners are rounded only sometimes.  When I try to restict accordions to a certain width, when they are hovered over they freak out.  For the time/date/title input elements: When the data-clear-btn is activated and data is input into the form, it is blocked by an additional bar.  Are problems like these common or 
[07:49:42] <loopsdeer> holymacaroons: That part looks okay. your click handler might be being applied just after this happens, if it's also in a $(function () { /* statement */ })
[07:50:27] <arschmitz> kraftcc: no i dont believe there are open issues for any of those things
[07:50:29] <voided> hi guys. im going NUTS here... no matter what i try i can fscking toggle checkboxes for the life of me! (jquery1.7) - i click a link that scrolls down to a div and automatically checks a checkbox... how hard can it be?!?!
[07:50:46] <sacho> voided, apparently, too hard for you.
[07:50:47] <voided> i tried .prop / .attr / everything...
[07:50:56] <voided> i suck  i know
[07:50:56] <sacho> Do you have code or anything to ask a question on?
[07:51:11] <kraftcc> arschmitz: Okay, well any hints..?
[07:51:14] <arschmitz> kraftcc: if you can reproduce any of those in a simple jsbin test page i would encourage you to file a bug on them so we can investigate
[07:51:41] <kraftcc> arschmitz: okay, perfect
[07:51:56] <voided> arf
[07:52:09] <voided> i don't know anymore...
[07:52:13] <holymacaroons> Im using jquery mobile. http://jsfiddle.net/mystix24/bCkhu/
[07:52:29] <loopsdeer> voided: jsfiddle.net
[07:52:44] <holymacaroons> I can't seem to get the dialog box to popup on pageload. I'm triggering a click event.
[07:53:01] <holymacaroons> And the trigger event is not being called because the dialog box is not opening.
[07:53:57] <blib> what is the correct way of reading a https url pointed image in jquery?
[07:56:23] <sacho> holymacaroons, where is the dialog's click event handler added?
[07:56:49] <holymacaroons> there is no handler.
[07:57:17] <sacho> so you think this is a native browser feature?
[07:57:22] <holymacaroons> I got it working by changing $('#clickme').trigger('click'); to $('a').trigger('click');
[07:57:37] <sacho> jesus.
[07:57:39] <holymacaroons> sacho, the event handler?
[07:57:42] <sacho> your id is #clickme, not clickme.
[07:58:25] * holymacaroons looks down. Walks away quitely.
[07:58:35] <holymacaroons> quietly*

[08:01:54] <voided> ok here it is... jQuery(":checkbox").attr("checked", true);      how can i modify this to include the checkboxe's id?
[08:02:05] <voided> cause this checks them all :}
[08:02:18] <loopsdeer> $(#myId:checkbox")....
[08:02:27] <voided> hmm thought i tried... let me try again
[08:02:40] <loopsdeer> $("#myId:checkbox") sry

[08:04:13] <voided> damit... grrr
[08:05:28] <kraftcc> arschmitz: I fixed one of the bugs.  I'll take a closer look at the others.  Thanks :)
[08:05:50] <john2496> hey guys, any idea why $.localStorage is undefined in 1.9.1?
[08:05:59] <john2496> it should work according to API docs @ http://www.jquerysdk.com/api/jQuery.localStorage
[08:06:07] <shoky> john2496: that's not the API docs
[08:06:18] <shoky> john2496: not for jquery, anyway
[08:06:25] <john2496> @shoky: crap thanks, just realized it's part of the storage plugin
[08:07:28] <arschmitz> kraftcc: no problem like i said though if you find anything that you can reproduce in a simplifed case plase file a bug so we can fix it
[08:08:54] <kraftcc> arschmitz: That's exactly how I found my error.  So I'll do that more often, and if I find something, I'll be sure to try and replicate it to report it to you.
[08:09:10] <arschmitz> kraftcc: awesome thank you
[08:10:51] <DOner> Is there any real reason why I wouldn't just give all of the elements I need a modify an ID and do my jquery on those ID's, versus a whole class or tag? I mean, assuming I just want to affect a single thing like a specific form field or a specific div?
[08:11:30] <DOner> I get that if I wanted to change all of my divs within a content field to be a different text height, or collapse all of them ro something
[08:12:51] <shoky> DOner: if you just want to affect one specific element, using an ID is fine
[08:13:28] <DOner> ok, I didn't know if it was inefficient or bad practice, thanks
[08:14:00] <shoky> DOner: if you got a specific scenario you wanna know about, make a jsfiddle/demo
[08:15:30] <DOner> I don't, it was just a general question

The funtion 1 excludes a specific element before running, that same element is also used by function 2. How best should i represent that element? I could reference the element in both function 1 & 2, but that is duplicationg code, and easier to introduce bugs. Perhaps i should set the element to a global

[08:50:22] <cusco> hi folks
[08:50:33] <ajmrsn> I read somewhere that $(document).on( 'pageinit', function () {} ); is  the alt in jquery mobile for jquery $(document).ready( function () { } ); — if that's correct would subsequent $(document).on('pagebeforeshow', function () { } ); go inside the 'pageinit' or would they stand outside of that 'pageinit' function
[08:50:53] <cusco> I'm using a dialog with two buttons ... one of them closes the dialog, the other performs a ajax() ...
[08:51:19] <arschmitz> ajmrsn: no they should not be nested in that way
[08:51:29] <blib> is there a way to setup sessions for AJAX using jquery?
[08:51:45] <ajmrsn> arschmitz: ok, thank you
[08:51:51] <cusco> on this ajax() I would like to evaluate the reply, and close the dialog... thing is creating the dialog with $("<div id='edit'>question</div>").dialog(...
[08:52:01] <cusco> I can't close it with $("<div id='edit'>question</div>").dialog(
[08:52:07] <cusco> I can't close it with $("<div id='edit'>question</div>").dialog('close');
[08:52:15] <cusco> inside the ajax() return
[08:52:19] <cusco> :(
[08:52:38] <cusco> how do I close it'
[08:53:11] <Clex> cusco: what about something like: var dialog = $("<div id='edit'>question</div>").dialog(); [...]; dialog.close();
[08:53:33] <shoky> you mean dialog.dialog('close')
[08:53:40] <Clex> Yes, sorry.
[08:53:41] <cusco> yes I got it.. let me try
[08:53:46] <Clex> Something like that.
[08:54:00] <Clex> You seem to recreate your dialog instead of closing the previously created one.
[08:54:58] <PhonicUK> does anyone know of a graphic library suitable for live data?
[08:55:14] <Spawnrj> howto my filter stop work in http://afsn.com.br/jquery/index.html
[08:55:35] <cusco> worked, thanks Clex :p
[08:55:46] <PhonicUK> *graphing
[08:56:18] <Clex> PhonicUK: flot, highcharts.
[08:57:03] <PhonicUK> oooh flot looks good
[08:57:09] <PhonicUK> exactly the kind of thing I need
[08:57:10] <PhonicUK> cheers
[08:59:46] <shoky> Spawnrj: you're including jquery twice
[09:00:17] <Spawnrj> but with no effect works
[09:00:40] <shoky> Spawnrj: don't include jquery twice
[09:01:19] <shoky> the 2nd time removes/overwrites the jquery-ui for example, and so you're getting: Uncaught TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'sortable'
[09:01:27] <jedimind> every site i do i include jquery at least 3 times
[09:01:30] <jedimind> to make sure its in there.
[09:02:00] <shoky> yes 3 is usually the ticket

[09:16:16] <RandalSchwartz> *triven* (09:15) Thank you Randal for prompt reply..the link you gave me shows  - how to add evenly distributed steps. In my case the increments(steps) are  - user defined.
[09:16:21] <RandalSchwartz> please don't pm people like that. :(
[09:16:34] <RandalSchwartz> unless you're paying me my consulting rate... then you can do whatever you want. :)

[09:23:13] <momomomomo> I'm having some odd issues with JQ UI datepicker in IE 8 - the 'month' select tab is not visible unless I add an offset.left to the datepicker, at which point, the entire datepicker is too far to the left to use
[09:36:19] <Spawnrj> someone could help me get to the first input function as the second? http://afsn.com.br/jquery/
[09:37:51] <Spawnrj> necessary that the first input (animated) filter the list as the second input on http://afsn.com.br/jquery
[09:50:25] <Spawnrj> removed the duplicates but I can not make the first act as the second input. http://afsn.com.br/jquery

[09:56:21] <guzzlefry> utroda: 1x10^6?
[09:57:07] <utroda> guzzlefry: I don't know, i have never seen that before and i didn't write the code
[09:57:36] <guzzlefry> utroda: That'd be my guess. I didn't know Javascript supported that notation though.
[09:59:11] <utroda> guzzlefry: yeah thats what it is
[09:59:30] <utroda> guzzlefry: thx for the help
[09:59:46] <Spawnrj> I can not make the first act as the second input. http://afsn.com.br/jquery
[10:00:24] <guzzlefry> np
[10:01:54] <RandalSchwartz> most scripting languages support some sort of scientific notation
[10:02:09] <Spawnrj> I can not make the first act as the second input. http://afsn.com.br/jquery , someone could help me?
[10:02:18] <RandalSchwartz> perl even supports embedded "commas" in the form of underscores: 1_000_000
[10:03:07] <RandalSchwartz> Spawnrj - you'll get more help if you reproduce the minimal case in jsfiddle orjsbin
[10:04:36] <Spawnrj> I can not play in jsFiddle because of separate scripts
[10:08:13] <webBuilder> hello friends, is there anything in jQuery adentical as yahoo page article cursor, I mean if you go to yahoo you will see a carousel like navigation that shows th earticles thumbnail and at the same time if you hover on to it, it will show big image of the article with some text. any idea on this ?
[10:08:18] <webBuilder> thank you in advance
[10:10:48] <Lianzinho> guys, how can I achieve the effect of element:visited with jquery, if the element is not an anchor?
[10:14:45] <mike_c> you could do something like $('#elementId').click(function() { $(this).addClass("visited")})
[10:17:26] <Lianzinho> mike_c : yeah, but this will wipe out if the user refresh
[10:18:10] <Lianzinho> mike_c : I need the exact same functionality as :visited, so it will remain with a different color until clear cache or something like that
[10:20:14] <mike_c> oh, I see - not sure how to do that , exactly....
[10:21:27] <guzzlefry> Does JQueryUI support IE7?
[10:24:55] <shoky> guzzlefry: yes
[10:25:52] <guzzlefry> Also, is there a way to slideUp(), but instead show an element rather than hiding it?
[10:26:16] <hazardous> slideDown()
[10:26:50] <guzzlefry> I want it to slide in the up direction though.
[10:27:59] <guzzlefry> oh, derp
[10:31:03] <mike_c> @guzzlefry - try $('#whatever').show("slide", { direction: "down" })
[10:33:37] <mike_c> for hiding, use  .hide("slide", { direction: "down" })
[10:33:57] <guzzlefry> mike_c: From what I understand, I need JQueryUI to do that?
[10:34:42] <mike_c> guzzlefry: yeah, I think that is correct
[10:35:32] <guzzlefry> cool, thank you
[10:35:50] <guzzlefry> Now to figure out if I have ancient versions of IE to test on. :)
[10:36:00] <mike_c> lol - yw
[10:36:11] <danheberden> you can also just use .animate() and animate top with position:relative;
[10:36:17] <danheberden> or margin-top
[10:37:27] <danheberden> ?source genFx
[10:37:28] <bot-t> Line#8086 - "return this.animate( genFx("show", 3), speed, easing, callback);" - http://bot-t.com/jquery.js#8086
[10:37:34] <barryhjames> Having trouble with a responsive drop down menu. If I use the menu on a smaller screen and then widen the screen to the full view, the menu disappears. jQuery is adding display: none as an inline style when the slideToggle is done. How do I get it to not add the inline style so that when I extend the browser wider, the menu doesn't diaper?
[10:37:35] <danheberden> ugh, that's old
[10:37:35] <hazardous> guzzlefry www.modern.ie/en-GB/virtualization-tools#downloads
[10:37:53] <barryhjames> Whoops, disappear, not diaper! http://stwilliam.jameswebdevelopment.com
[10:38:03] <danheberden> guzzlefry: http://code.jquery.com/jquery.js - search for slideDown
[10:39:44] <BillCriswell> Hmmm
[10:39:50] <BillCriswell> Internet just connected... I think?
[10:39:56] <BillCriswell> disconnected*
[10:39:59] <guzzlefry> nope
[10:40:03] <BillCriswell> Oh, awesome.
[10:40:25] <guzzlefry> Nothing more fun than realizing your IRC connect has been dead for 5 minutes without any notification :P
[10:40:39] <BillCriswell> guzzlefry: Haha that's what I was waiting for.
[10:40:58] <BillCriswell> Netflix crapped out on me and I tried to Google with no luck, seems ok now though.
[10:41:13] <bryanstedman> barryhjames: another more hacky way to deal with it would be to use enquirejs to be specify $('.menu').show() at a certain breakpoint
[10:42:11] <barryhjames> bryanstedman: Didn't there used to be a way to specify what should happen at each state of the toggle?
[10:44:21] <bryanstedman> barryhjames: not sure how you mean...
[10:50:04] <d4rklit3> hellloo
[10:50:36] <d4rklit3> I have a question, if im using underscore templates to on the fly render stuff in my page, will jquery detect (document).ready() everytime i change the DOM?
[10:52:40] <shoky> barryhjames: bit hacky but seems to solve it.. $('header + nav .group > ul').slideToggle('slow',function(){ if (this.style.display==='none') { this.style.display=''; }});
[10:52:46] <BillCriswell> d4rklit3: No.
[10:53:23] <d4rklit3> ok then
[10:54:04] <BillCriswell> d4rklit3: If you're continually adding elements to a page or something along those lines you'd need to use event delegation probably.
[10:54:17] <barryhjames> shoky: Hacky or not, it works. Thanks, I appreciate it.
[10:54:43] <bryanstedman> shoky: barryhjames: Do either of you know how bootstrap tackles this?
[10:54:59] <d4rklit3> i dunno im having some issues with rendering templates and timelinemax (not really jquery).my timelines skip after the initial play and im trying to figure out why this is happening.
[10:55:00] <shoky> not I
[10:55:41] <barryhjames> bryanstedman: Not sure, I never use bootstrap. If you find out, though, let us know. I wish there was a way with toggle that you could add rules for things to happen in each state.
[10:56:41] <bryanstedman> barryhjames: I'm wondering if they use !important in their stylesheets
[10:56:59] <BillCriswell> d4rklit3: Not following you really.
[10:57:11] <d4rklit3> are yo ufamilair with greensock libs?
[10:57:51] <BillCriswell> i am not
[10:58:58] <d4rklit3> its an tweening animation lib, it has some interesting features. primarily creating a sequenced timeline you can control like a video (almost) . I am using it to sequence transitiions between my pages sections. the problem is each section is rendered on demand but the rendering process interferes with the smoothness of the animation, so i need to know when the browser is actually done rendering.
[10:59:50] <d4rklit3> im seeing now, if i put a delay before the animation starts then its nice and smooth, if i don't then it skips a bunch of the beginning of the animation because its still rendering the page
[10:59:59] <d4rklit3> so i need some way to know its done rendering
[11:03:59] <shoky> d4rklit3: if you want help you'll need to provide a demo
[11:04:21] <d4rklit3> i just need a way to listen for the dom changing
[11:04:27] <d4rklit3> to know when its done
[11:04:32] <shoky> there is no good general way
[11:05:48] <d4rklit3> ok well what you recommend rendering all the views to the dom first then just moving them around?
[11:05:55] <d4rklit3> i feel like that would eat too much memory
[11:06:08] <shoky> all i recommended was for you to provide a demo
[11:06:15] <shoky> and i stand by that
[11:08:35] <d4rklit3> its not really a jqeury question
[11:08:38] <Scramblejams> Hi all, jquery noob here. I've created an audio element (using document.createElement()), and I'd like to add it to a div. However, calling $('divId').append(myElement) doesn't work, of course. Is there a way in jQuery to pass it an arbitrary element and have it generate the corresponding HTML when appending it?
[11:08:40] <d4rklit3> so i wont bother you guys anymore
[11:08:45] <shoky> it wasn't really a jquery answer
[11:08:53] <d4rklit3> if jq doesnt have a way to detect dom change
[11:08:58] <d4rklit3> then its moot anyways
[11:09:09] <Eviltwin> Scramblejams: $('divId') not $('#divId')?
[11:09:39] <Scramblejams> dblosevn: Oh, was that wrong? Needs a number sign? Okay.
[11:10:03] <Scramblejams> Hey, that fixed it! Thanks!
[11:10:09] <Eviltwin> In jQuery it takes a CSS selector, not just an ID
[11:10:51] <Scramblejams> Eviltwin: I'll pretend I know what you mean. I program frontends because I'm forced to, not because I'm good at it. :-)
[11:11:26] <NoiseEee> http://davidwalsh.name/detect-node-insertion @ d4rklit3
[11:11:57] <d4rklit3> cant use it
[11:12:01] <d4rklit3> wont work in ie
[11:12:03] <d4rklit3> :(
[11:12:53] <bryanstedman> Scramblejams: IDs are prefixed with # and classes with .
[11:13:10] <bryanstedman> like CSS
[11:13:37] <Eviltwin> It's too bad those are the only two things you can select by :P
[11:13:57] <Scramblejams> bryanstedman: Thanks, I need to learn some CSS I guess.
[11:15:07] <bryanstedman> Scramblejams: no worries - you won't need to dive too deep. tags work as well - $('span'), for example would select all spans
[11:15:41] <Scramblejams> Ok, thanks for the info.
[11:16:07] <Eviltwin> bryanstedman: And all of these things: http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/
[11:16:08] <d4rklit3> NoiseEee , if i add a delay of like 1 second then its fine
[11:16:17] <d4rklit3> i have to trick the user into thinking its worth the wait though
[11:16:32] <Scramblejams> Oh, nice overview.
[11:17:05] <bryanstedman> Eviltwin: right, of course.
[11:17:30] <bryanstedman> I figure tags, classes and ids are where to start though
[11:18:27] <Scramblejams> Cool, thanks brian and evil.
[11:18:47] <FrenlySeal> try not to use IDs
[11:19:06] <FrenlySeal> classes and custom attributes is a good way
[11:19:18] <jedimind> down with IDs!
[11:19:28] <Eviltwin> Nice arbitrary rule
[11:19:38] <jedimind> its not arbitrary
[11:19:45] <FrenlySeal> jedimind: i guess ur doign web 1.0 stull
[11:19:49] <jeffreylevesque> is it possible to remove .focus attribute with a mouseover bind?
[11:19:51] <FrenlySeal> lol
[11:19:59] <shoky> ...
[11:20:00] <bryanstedman> FrenlySeal: I keep IDs out of my stylesheets, but am fine with using them with JS
[11:20:03] <jedimind> using IDs for CSS purposes is actually silly
[11:20:16] <jedimind> they should be used as bryan stated
[11:20:34] <BillCriswell> jeffreylevesque: $el.on('mouseenter', function(){ $el2.off('focus'); }): ?
[11:20:38] <FrenlySeal> jedimind: oh coz u know best lol
[11:20:49] <jedimind> FrenlySeal no, because i educate myself
[11:20:51] <jedimind> and read things
[11:20:56] <jedimind> and have been doing this for close to 20 years
[11:21:05] <BillCriswell> Speaking of reading. I can't wait to get drunk.
[11:21:06] <FrenlySeal> yea from 1200 BC
[11:21:11] <FrenlySeal> the old testament
[11:21:22] <jedimind> i cant tell if youre trolling or actually retarded
[11:21:34] <shoky> uh, wasn't jedimind actually agreeing with you.. somewhat
[11:21:34] <FrenlySeal> jedimind: ive been doing this 15 yrs
[11:21:44] <BillCriswell> ... 1200BC would be way before the old testament?
[11:21:50] <jedimind> BillCriswell lets not get technical
[11:21:56] <FrenlySeal> kekeke
[11:21:57] <_amg> 2pac says wassup niggas
[11:22:07] <FrenlySeal> anyways back to coding
[11:22:09] <jedimind> 2pac was around in 1200BC
[11:22:11] <FrenlySeal> :O
[11:22:22] <FrenlySeal> im luvin my new backbone setup
[11:22:39] <FrenlySeal> also can i run sumthing by u pplz
[11:22:48] <jedimind> nope
[11:22:54] <shoky> NoiseEee: that's a cute hack but doesn't even work in IE10 :S
[11:22:57] <FrenlySeal> so in backbone
[11:23:18] <FrenlySeal> you place ur model row and form for that row
[11:23:24] <FrenlySeal> in the modelview
[11:23:25] <jedimind> this isnt #backbone
[11:23:32] <FrenlySeal> dood wats ur problem
[11:23:36] <NoiseEee> shoky: sad face :(
[11:23:50] <BillCriswell> I'm watching Tim & Eric's Billion Dollar movie for a second time. It just gets funnier.
[11:23:50] <FrenlySeal> #backbone is silent
[11:23:52] <jedimind> i dont actually have a problem, but you started acting like a douche
[11:23:58] <shoky> SHRIMMMMMMMMMM!
[11:24:16] <BillCriswell> SCRIMMM
[11:24:18] <s5fs> FrenlySeal: if #backbone is silent you may have more luck in #javascript.
[11:24:18] <FrenlySeal> ok leme run my theory by
[11:24:24] <BillCriswell> SHRIMMM
[11:24:26] <BillCriswell> I mean.
[11:24:31] <shoky> xD
[11:24:38] <FrenlySeal> anyone here familiar w backbone
[11:24:46] <FrenlySeal> or mvc style js
[11:24:55] <BillCriswell> The scene where he meets jeffery is so incredibly awkward.
[11:24:55] <shoky> nobody
[11:24:58] <s5fs> FrenlySeal: there's also stackoverflow
[11:25:01] <NoiseEee> FrenlySeal: #documentcloud
[11:25:10] <FrenlySeal> NoiseEee: im there
[11:25:12] <FrenlySeal> kekeke
[11:25:15] <NoiseEee> well that's your best bet
[11:25:26] <FrenlySeal> no its jus a design q
[11:25:29] <shoky> BillCriswell: i love the opening scene with johnny depp
[11:25:35] <FrenlySeal> ok ill make it simple
[11:25:41] <jeffreylevesque> BillCriswell: I'm right here
[11:25:44] <s5fs> FrenlySeal: i'm giving you suggestions because I feel this isn't the best channel to field your question.
[11:25:46] <FrenlySeal> should i place the edit form under the row
[11:25:51] <FrenlySeal> or make its own page?
[11:25:54] <BillCriswell> I had to look it up the first time I saw it shoky. I really thought it was him.
[11:26:01] <shoky> lol :)
[11:26:03] <BillCriswell> It should have been. I think he would have been willing to.
[11:26:12] <shoky> heh
[11:26:28] <FrenlySeal> the way a modelview works its very convenient to place edit form under the row
[11:26:58] <NoiseEee> FrenlySeal: its a great question for #documentcloud or even ##javascript, but truly nothing to do with #jquery
[11:27:11] <FrenlySeal> :|
[11:27:13] <FrenlySeal> damit
[11:28:38] <BillCriswell> Ray Wise is great.
[11:28:54] <BillCriswell> I forgot to set a timer for my pizza. I better just get out of house now.
[11:28:56] <shoky> ever since twin peaks
[11:29:10] <FrenlySeal> thx 4 ur help gaize
[11:29:13] <FrenlySeal> \o/
[11:29:16] <BillCriswell> Leland was my favorite character for sure.
[11:29:24] <shoky> mine too ;]
[11:29:29] <FrenlySeal> and me
[11:29:30] <BillCriswell> Well.. besides the man from another place. I like his red suit.
[11:30:25] <BillCriswell> His dance moves are great as well.
[11:30:35] <BillCriswell> Well... so were Lelands. Hard call.
[11:30:49] <shoky> he also likes jquery. now it's relevant
[11:31:38] <BillCriswell> We should make a lovesjquery.com domain with subdomains for whenever we get off topic.
[11:31:52] <BillCriswell> raywise.lovesjquery.com
[11:32:02] <shoky> ;]
[11:35:06] <grafi> do it
[11:35:17] <BillCriswell> I'm entirely too lazy to really do anything.
[11:35:26] <FrenlySeal> lol
[11:35:33] <FrenlySeal> so help me
[11:35:40] <FrenlySeal> edit form on its own page
[11:35:44] <FrenlySeal> or under item
[11:36:56] <dan1> I have complict between jquery library of ajaxcomplete and autocomplete
[11:37:44] <dan1> look at : http://www.dollarannonce.com/inscription_test.php
[11:39:26] <grafi> apparently you like money very much?
[11:39:37] <FrenlySeal> lol
[11:39:38] <dan1> sometime yes
[11:39:55] <cusco> hi
[11:39:56] <jayar> anyone use the skitter-slider js?
[11:39:57] <dan1> grafi I redistribute 30% of my income
[11:40:07] <cusco> can I use .attr() to create a custom attribute name?
[11:40:11] <cusco> in a html element?
[11:40:17] <FrenlySeal> cusco: yes
[11:40:55] <dan1> so on my webpage the jquery.noconflcit(true) don't work for the ajaxcomplete
[11:41:21] <virgo> helly, how can i select parent element inside jquery selector string?
[11:41:51] <FrenlySeal> .papa()
[11:42:07] <FrenlySeal> or .grampa()
[11:42:26] <Eviltwin> Now I need to write a plugin for all the family terms
[11:42:33] <Eviltwin> .cousin()
[11:42:36] <Eviltwin> .nephew()
[11:42:47] <Eviltwin> .secondCousinTwiceRemoved()
[11:42:50] <FrenlySeal> incest?
[11:43:01] <shoky> how patrilineal of you
[11:43:13] <dan1> is there a reason why jquery.noConflict() don't work for one function an donly one
[11:44:35] <cusco> and how can I list the attributes in a element?
[11:44:38] <FrenlySeal> FUCK!!
[11:44:48] <cusco> $(element).attr()
[11:44:49] <FrenlySeal> form on its own page or under the row
[11:44:52] <FrenlySeal> god help me
[11:44:56] <FrenlySeal> ???????
[11:45:09] <FrenlySeal> im gona start blowing things up
[11:45:19] <grafi> have fun with that
[11:45:32] <Eviltwin> Do you actually have question
[11:45:35] <Eviltwin> Because that's not a question
[11:45:39] <FrenlySeal> yes it is
[11:45:49] <Validatorian> Ahoy. I'm trying to clean up a selector that seems considerably more complex than it should be for selecting a parent menu item link -- anyone want to have a go? http://jsfiddle.net/Zx6ke/ (really simple example)
[11:45:58] <grafi> now thats a question
[11:46:21] <virgo> Validatorian, im trying to do very similar thing
[11:46:23] <dan1> mine is not easy to!!!
[11:46:32] <virgo> i need also select parent element inside the selector string
[11:46:43] <virgo> but i dont know how
[11:47:01] <virgo> i know the ">" sign means children
[11:47:03] <Validatorian> virgo: Check my example, which works. I just want it to not be so complex if it doesn't have to be... it's ugly
[11:47:06] <Eviltwin> Validatorian: http://jsfiddle.net/Zx6ke/1/ ?
[11:47:15] <Validatorian> virgo: That means DIRECT child
[11:47:28] <virgo> yes, i need direct parent also
[11:47:39] <virgo> not grandparent or anything
[11:48:02] <Eviltwin> virgo: Can you try to explain in english the elements you are trying to select?
[11:48:12] <cusco> how can I list all attributes of a element?
[11:48:21] <Eviltwin> cusco: element.attributes ?
[11:48:34] <Validatorian> Eviltwin: Haha, that's exactly what I was looking for. In fact, I can even remove the $(this).addClass('selected') with this.
[11:48:38] <Validatorian> thank you :)
[11:48:52] <cusco> Eviltwin: cannot read property 'attributes' of err... undefined .. ok
[11:49:16] <Eviltwin> cusco: Access the attributes property of the element in question
[11:49:24] <Eviltwin> Don't literally type element.attributes
[11:49:43] <virgo> Eviltwin, i am trying to select parent of the <a> while checking that the <>
[11:49:50] <virgo> a contains some string
[11:49:54] <blib> localstorage in html5 - Can I use it to store passwords? Is it safe? Do other web apps have access to this storage?
[11:50:02] <Eviltwin> virgo: A specific string or any string?
[11:50:32] <virgo> im using the a:contains("link_name"), but now need parent of this
[11:51:47] <virgo> or should i use li:contains(a:contains("link_name")) ?
[11:51:51] <shoky> ?parent
[11:51:51] <bot-t> .parent([selector]): Get the parent of each element in the current set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/parent/
[11:52:11] <grafi> bot-t is a god
[11:52:50] <Eviltwin> virgo: http://jsfiddle.net/eNQzL/
[11:54:44] <virgo> but its a separate function not a selector string :(
[11:55:19] <virgo> would be good if for example "<" sign gives me direct parent of the selected element
[11:55:44] <toddWork__> how do i get around the 'this' problem. i'm using .prototype to extend a method but 'this' is overridden in a jQuery loop.
[11:56:18] <toddWork__> do i need to set it before going into the jQuery loop in every function or is there a way that i can access that outter prototyped 'this'?
[11:56:52] <shoky> toddWork__: var self = this;  ?
[11:56:55] <mydog2> hey guys.. quick/basic question... "tr" can have "id='foo'" << right?
[11:57:15] <shoky> mydog2: you can't try it and see?
[11:57:20] <dan1> $jq("#status").ajaxComplete(function(event, request, settings){
[11:57:35] <dan1> with var $jq = jQuery.noConflict(true);
[11:57:42] <dan1> and still not working
[11:57:56] <mydog2> hey shoky  - my browser/net connection was slow!
[11:58:00] <mydog2> it can..
[11:58:26] <shoky> dan1: As of jQuery 1.8, the .ajaxComplete() method should only be attached to document.
[11:59:05] <dan1> jquery-1.2.6.min.js
[11:59:07] <toddWork__> shoky: right, so i need to set 'self' everytime. i'm curious as there is a way to get that outer function w/out doing that.
[11:59:10] <shoky> lol.
[11:59:19] <eN_Joy> can someone take a look here: http://tmobile.blogsite.org/ i am trying to implement jQuery jPlayer on my joomla site, starting with the very basic then work on dynamic playlist, but i don't seem to get the basic player working, i've about the namespacing issue with mootools, i wonder if someone can tell if i hit that
[11:59:45] <toddWork__> mydog2: but only 1 id. :)
[11:59:46] <eN_Joy> what i did was merely copied from here: http://tmobile.blogsite.org/j2/demo-01-pf.htm
[12:00:23] <shoky> toddWork__: i'd need to see your code to give other answers.. there are other ways too like using .bind
[12:00:28] <dan1> shoky do you have the syntax of it please?
[12:00:45] <shoky> dan1: of what?
[12:01:09] <dan1> ajaxcomplete() method should be attached to document?
[12:01:30] <shoky> dan1: as of 1.8
[12:01:54] <dan1> but I'm 1.2
[12:02:02] <shoky> then what do you want from me
[12:02:16] <Validatorian> Eviltwin: Why isn't it selecting both of the submenu children with $(this).parents('li').children('a').addClass('selected');?
[12:02:22] <dan1> autocomplete is 1.9
[12:02:35] <dan1> so that probably where is the conflict
[12:02:51] <Validatorian> it seems like as soon as it reaches the parent li, both 'a''s would be selected with .children('a')
[12:03:03] <toddWork__> shoky: https://gist.github.com/cernalpanic/37e8f0664b166ff07493 thanks
[12:03:42] <Eviltwin> Validatorian: Is this not working? http://jsfiddle.net/Zx6ke/2/
[12:04:14] <mydog2> toddWork__,  - that i knew!  i was checking out the validator site.. i'm not a web guy.. and don't pretend to be one.. but it helps to have a better understanding of how things fit sometimes..
[12:04:37] <Validatorian> Eviltwin: Oh, it works -- I'm asking *why* -- I don't understand how .parents('li').children('a') wouldn't select both of the submenu items.
[12:04:59] <Eviltwin> But it does?
[12:05:29] <dan1> shoky I would like you to tell me my mistake. this is a nightmare I can't find it
[12:05:53] <Validatorian> I mean both of the 'When I am clicked' items -- it selects the one you click on, and the parent, which is what it's supposed to do... but I don't understand why it's not selecting the sibling to the sub-menu item I click on
[12:06:01] <toddWork__> mydog2: knowing that dom elements only get 1 ID is pretty good for a non-web guy.
[12:06:23] <Eviltwin> Validatorian: .children() means immediate children
[12:06:38] <Eviltwin> Not children of child elements etc
[12:06:56] <Validatorian> ah, that'll be why then -- I thought it was recursive
[12:06:59] <Validatorian> thanks again Eviltwin
[12:06:59] <shoky> toddWork__: i don't really have any other suggestion for that case.. also not sure what you mean with "every jQuery function that returns a this"
[12:07:11] <Eviltwin> Validatorian: That'd be .find() :P
[12:07:40] <Validatorian> yea, yea -- it's been a while since I've had to do much traversal work, getting rusty :)
[12:07:45] <jayar> im using the skitter-slider .js, but if i use images that dont fill the div, they dont 'clear' between transitions, so they kinda 'double-up' ... what can i use to clear the image between transitions?
[12:07:53] <toddWork__> shoky: it's a minor thing. let's say i have 50 prototyp functions each w/ a jQuery selector loop; i'm hating have to repeat myself in every function to redeclare this. thanks for looking.
[12:08:16] <shoky> toddWork__: so for every prototype function that has a nested function, you mean
[12:08:44] <toddWork__> shoky: yes. my gut is telling me that i'm doing it wrong.
[12:09:15] <shoky> toddWork__: i wouldn't say that
[12:09:21] <toddWork__> "why don't you just grab the prototype handle" or something else i don't know about.
[12:09:33] <shoky> heh
[12:09:36] <virgo> got it working! Instead of building jquery selector with loop, i build javascript with loop and eval saves the day :)
[12:09:47] <grafi> :|
[12:09:53] <toddWork__> ha!
[12:10:03] <Eviltwin> Uh...
[12:10:05] <Eviltwin> eval?
[12:10:07] <shoky> toddWork__: ask Eviltwin if he has another suggestion. if both of us don't, i think your gut should relax
[12:10:36] <toddWork__> hehe. Eviltwin? https://gist.github.com/cernalpanic/37e8f0664b166ff07493
[12:10:37] <Spawnrj> anyone know why the first input is not in fact the second? and because the latter has the effect but can not filter? http://afsn.com.br/jquery/
[12:10:38] <NoiseEee> "eval saves the day" ummm
[12:10:58] <grafi> said no one ever
[12:11:02] <grafi> :P
[12:11:20] <Eviltwin> toddWork__: There's .bind() but it's not universally supported yet
[12:11:23] <Eviltwin> It can be polyfilled
[12:11:38] <dan1> could you tell me why the Courriel field froze at http://www.dollarannonce.com/inscription_test.php
[12:11:53] <toddWork__> thanks Eviltwin; i will proceed.
[12:12:00] <dan1> this is the ajaxcomplete() who bug
[12:12:33] <Eviltwin> toddWork__: http://pastebin.com/gdD65rda
[12:12:41] <Eviltwin> You can polyfill bind
[12:12:50] <Cache_Money> How come when I mouseout of this div the child element doesn't disappear? http://pastebin.com/YkCn7CcF
[12:13:02] <shoky> there's also $.proxy
[12:13:26] <Eviltwin> http://pastebin.com/yFArx1ah
[12:13:28] <Eviltwin> Yeah
[12:13:41] <Spawnrj> algum brasileiro?
[12:13:43] <toddWork__> shoky: yeah, i was reading about that; and i can use it in some places but i don't know if it's appropriate for what i'm doing.
[12:13:55] <shoky> tho bind/proxy seems like more work to me
[12:14:11] <Eviltwin> .bind() has a slight perf win over $.proxy() if it's supported natively by the browser
[12:14:39] <Eviltwin> And if it has to fall back on the polyfill, then it's about the same as $.proxy
[12:14:50] <Eviltwin> But it saves you from the constant var ... = this;
[12:15:04] <toddWork__> Eviltwin 'm just staring at that code trying to figure out what it's doing. probably a sign that i should just set a local var each time.
[12:15:08] <grafi> instead you do a constand .bind(this) ?
[12:15:14] <grafi> *constant
[12:15:26] <Eviltwin> Yes but you don't add any new variables
[12:15:39] <grafi> hm, true
[12:15:41] <Eviltwin> It's fixed, it can't be overwritten at that point
[12:16:45] <toddWork__> i'll set the var, and hopefully Brendan Eich will never have to edit my code. :)

[12:20:36] <mydog2> toddWork__,  - i actually know a great deal more.. but i'm not the dev dude... i'm the guy higher up the chain.. my days of doing hard core coding were long ago..
[12:20:58] <mydog2> toddWork__,  - but for certain projects.. i tend to get dirty again...

[12:26:34] <deckTrout> hi
[12:26:36] <deckTrout> people
[12:26:52] <Spawnrj> hi
[12:27:13] <deckTrout> my ftp works which means my connection is ok but my browser keeps failing to connect to internet
[12:27:15] <deckTrout> chrome and IE
[12:27:19] <deckTrout> with 103 error
[12:29:00] <Spawnrj> change your dns
[12:29:10] <Spawnrj> 8.8.8.8
[12:29:16] <Spawnrj> or 8.8.8.4
[12:29:23] <Spawnrj> google dns
[12:30:41] <NoiseEee> deckTrout: i have no idea why you'd possibly be asking that in #jquery, but  a quick google suggests you turn off Kapersky AV
[12:31:09] <Spawnrj> reeinstall google chrome
[12:31:30] <Spawnrj> https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/136678?hl=en
[12:32:52] <Spawnrj> I've found if I disable it then open a Google website via Chrome and then reactivate Kapersky it works ok.

[12:41:01] <abes> Question: I am using HTML file load to get an .html file as an object in my script. The object itself is base64, but I need to have access to the actual HTML content rather than base64 object. Any ways to "convert" base64 object to ascii/text
[12:41:14] <virgo> anyone interested of my latest javascript application menu version?
[12:44:07] <Spawnrj> Anyone know how I can filter the list with the second input or have the effect of the second input to the first filter?  here exemple: http://afsn.com.br/jquery
[12:45:22] <Spawnrj> http://www.webtoolkit.info/javascript-base64.html
[12:46:37] <abes> Spawnrj: thanks! for your question - have you considered angular.js?
[12:48:19] <Niels___> i'm using zurb foundation 4 in able to use the reveal modals. however, i would like to be able to open hrefs inside the modal itself when clicked, is that doable? i tried the data-reveal-ajax, but that was just for loading content with ajax when opened the first time. any clues?
[12:48:29] <baordog> I'm having trouble understanding the syntax for $.post
[12:49:35] <baordog> I'm using syntax like http://pastie.org/8064134 - how do I tell $.post which variables I would like to sent to the php function?
[12:50:41] <frosT_> anybody knows what might be wrong with this json format im passing to data: http://jsfiddle.net/V6GVz/1/
[12:51:23] <monk3y> baordog: the syntax for .post is right here [http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.post/], and the data parameter takes the URL parameters.
[12:51:59] <BD--> I'm getting the strangest error. So I do an ajax POST call, which either returns html or a simple json object. I make this call from inside the 'submit' event of a jquery dialog. The content of this dialog was requested through another ajax (GET) call. Now here's the funny thing: if *the content inside the dialog* got loaded through the .load() method, it works fine. But when I use .ajax() to
[12:51:59] <BD--> retrieve the exact same content, and then POST on submit of the dialog, my browser simply redirects to the returned returned json string instead of executing the 'success' (or error) event of this POST ajax call ? The content of the html page is exactly the same. Exactly the same call is made. Wtf.
[12:52:28] <baordog> monk3y:  I've been reading that link and can make no sense of it. Where do I put in the javascript variables I would like to send to my php funciton?
[12:53:26] <grafi> baordog arent you already sending stuff with the post?
[12:54:02] <monk3y> baordog: I hear ya man, I took a few passes before it clicking in my mind.
[12:55:00] <monk3y> baordog: just copy the first example call to .post from the jQuery URL I sent you, then replace the 'URL' value with your PHP scripts' URL, then replace the 'data' value with $('#formId input').serialize().
[12:55:17] <monk3y> This may not work exactly as you need it straight away, but that's the first two steps to help you understand how it works.
[12:55:27] <baordog> grafi: I know that $.post is supposed to post to the php script I mentioned. I don't know what though. Does it post EVERY variable in my script? It's not like doing an html form where what is supposed to be posted is explicity.
[12:55:47] <baordog> I think that's the disconnect here. I don't want to post a form, I just want to shuffle data from variable to PHP.
[12:56:50] <baordog> wait so data could be my variable?
[12:57:01] <grafi> the second argument in your paste is what gets posted to the php
[12:57:20] <grafi> { "controllerfunc": "convertandsave" }
[12:57:51] <grafi> so in your script $_POST['controllerfunc'] should echo converandsave
[12:57:56] <monk3y> baordog: I think I get it; you don't have a form as-such, but you have a value on the page somewhere that you want to push to a PHP script that's going to scan either $_REQUEST for that variable.  So just call POST, specify the PHP page's URL, and it's in data that you specify the value.  So instead of using serialize (that's for form-vars, just use: "data: 'value='+jsVariable"
[12:59:24] <Spawnrj> I can not do the second input filter the list as the top    http://afsn.com.br/jquery
[13:00:28] <grafi> @ Spawnrj i have not a single clue what you are trying to achieve
[13:00:33] <baordog> thanks guys, I think that did the trick.
[13:01:04] <virgo> grafi, i am also having hard time figuring our what Spawnrj wants
[13:01:24] <Spawnrj> I'm trying to do the second input filter list
[13:01:24] <grafi> at least i'm not alone
[13:02:08] <virgo> Spawnrj, do you wanna filter out second input out of all the inputs?
[13:02:28] <Spawnrj> I am Brazilian and my English is horrible
[13:02:46] <Spawnrj> need the second input filter also
[13:02:51] <_amg> si se puede
[13:03:30] <Spawnrj> http://pastebin.com/Thvi29eq
[13:04:34] <_amg> me gusta
[13:04:43] <Spawnrj> like the second input (which has the effect) as the first filter http://pastebin.com/Thvi29eq
[13:05:06] <_amg> no se puede
[13:05:54] <Spawnrj> the first input filters the list normally. I can not do the second input filter the list below
[13:06:03] <virgo> Spawnrj, why not give the input ID-s and access them with $('#input_id')   ?
[13:06:13] <shoky> Spawnrj: do the same thing on the 2nd input that you're doing on the first...
[13:06:39] <shoky> Spawnrj: http://pastebin.com/DuJHaXw2
[13:08:23] <virgo> sorry, Spawnrj, i get it now -.-
[13:08:57] <Spawnrj> I'm testing
[13:09:14] <virgo> should be rather easy to make two inputs to make the same thing
[13:09:49] <grafi> but why would you
[13:09:57] <virgo> thats another question
[13:10:08] <Spawnrj> I do not need the 2 inputs, I need only the second filter the list below
[13:10:12] <shoky> Spawnrj: actually my paste won't work i think
[13:10:28] <grafi> why not delete the second?
[13:10:34] <grafi> so you have only one?
[13:10:37] <virgo> oh, you only want to bind the event to second input?
[13:10:42] <grafi> im sorry if that makes no sense
[13:10:46] <Spawnrj> only because I managed to put the first filter lists below
[13:10:57] <baconmania> Hey guys, I have a
[13:11:08] <Spawnrj> yes yes
[13:11:23] <baconmania> question about HTTP POST. Do POST bodies NEED to be formatted as key/value pairs? Or can you just send a chunk of text?
[13:11:25] <virgo> then give unique id attribute to both inputs and bind the plugin to the second input
[13:11:42] <BD--> I'm getting the strangest error. So I do an ajax POST call, which either returns html or a simple json object. I make this call from inside the 'submit' event of a jquery dialog. The content of this dialog was requested through another ajax (GET) call. Now here's the funny thing: if *the content inside the dialog* got loaded through the .load() method, it works fine. But when I use .ajax() to
[13:11:42] <BD--> retrieve the exact same content, and then POST on submit of the dialog, my browser simply redirects to the returned returned json string instead of executing the 'success' (or error) event of this POST ajax call ? The content of the html page is exactly the same. Exactly the same call is made. Wtf.
[13:12:03] <shoky> baconmania: you can send a chunk of text
[13:12:42] <shoky> baconmania: hopefully your server knows what to do with it. content-type header can help
[13:13:06] <baconmania> shoky: Thanks. Do I need to set any particular headers to ensure that servers/serverside frameworks won't try to break up my POST body into key/value pairs? Like a particular content-type?
[13:13:26] <shoky> baconmania: you're asking me about all servers/serverside frameworks in the world?
[13:13:38] <baconmania> No, I'm working with express+node
[13:14:00] <baconmania> But I figured I'd get an answer here faster, which I did haha :P
[13:14:14] <shoky> baconmania: i donno. but key/value pairs usually come with "application/x-www-form-urlencoded"  content type
[13:14:21] <BD--> The two versions of the html file are here: https://gist.github.com/vincentsels/c68c318d8b2c1abc7e6d - The javascript is at the bottom, and the modal dialog is just above that.
[13:14:43] <shoky> baconmania: if you wanna send a chunk of text you should prolly send "application/text" content-type or smth
[13:15:17] <baconmania> shoky: I'll try it. thanks muchly!

[14:12:11] <DeoSama> I'm trying to get an array of all the labels on my DOM. I then want to check to see whether or not they have a certain class, and if so, do something. I'm currently getting a list of the labels by using .get(). I then have a for loop iterating over the list, but I can't do array[i].hasClass("text"), how can I do what I want? I'm stuck. :(
[14:12:49] <rainabba> Well there's my problem! dotNET.HtmlEncode(stringToClean)="&lt;div&gt;It&#39;s valid!&lt;/div&gt;", dotNET.JavaScriptStringEncode(stringToClean)"\u003cdiv\u003eIt\u0027s valid!\u003c/div\u003e" but I need JS.escape(stringToClean)="%3Cdiv%3EIt%27s%20valid%21%3C/div%3E"  Now just to figure out how to get .Net to do a proper JS escape.
[14:13:02] <shoky> DeoSama:  $('label.text').doSomething() ?
[14:13:32] <shoky> DeoSama: no need for .get() anyways, most likely
[14:13:39] <ernston> hi
[14:13:57] <rainabba> DeoSama: $.each('label', function(i,o) { if(something) { doThis(o); } });
[14:14:14] <shoky> you mean $('label').each
[14:14:23] <rainabba> maybe
[14:14:28] <rainabba> Your guess is as good as ine
[14:14:30] <rainabba> mine
[14:14:39] <shoky> $.each('label',.. would probably loop over l,a,b,e,l :P
[14:14:49] <shoky> or just do nothing
[14:14:52] <rainabba> That could be cool
[14:14:57] <DeoSama> haha
[14:14:59] <DeoSama> that COULD be cool.
[14:15:07] <Eviltwin> mvpgraff: Try making it strictly required

[14:23:10] <thesisb> jquery is built on top of pure js
[14:23:22] <thesisb> figure out the best way to do whatever you want and eventually youll know both
[14:23:35] <FrenlySeal> ernston: doesnt mater
[14:23:47] <FrenlySeal> jq is a js lib
[14:24:07] <Seus> question: If i wanted to have a live event on a text area, and have it trigger an event when the text area text changes from a knockout.js loading new content into the text area, what observable event would I use? or is there something else that I would want to do? Thanks
[14:24:11] <FrenlySeal> ull learn most of js through using jq
[14:24:22] <Eviltwin> ernston: The recommended order is to have at least an intermediate knowledge of JS before you do jQuery
[14:24:25] <Eviltwin> ?learn @ ernston
[14:24:26] <bot-t> ernston, First learn JavaScript (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/learn/javascript) then learn jQuery (http://jqfundamentals.com/)
[14:24:30] <Eviltwin> Intermediate as defined in that first link
[14:24:47] <shoky> DeoSama: $('label.text').removeClass('text')  ?
[14:24:48] <FrenlySeal> Eviltwin: stop being evil
[14:25:05] <FrenlySeal> start being frenly
[14:25:06] <shoky> DeoSama: or error instead of text
[14:25:18] <FrenlySeal> O______________O
[14:25:24] <FrenlySeal> <- frenly
[14:25:54] <DeoSama> shoky: would that iterate over all labels that have class "text"? Or just the first one?
[14:26:02] <FrenlySeal> so whats next before u learn JS u must learn C
[14:26:12] <shoky> ?removeclass @ deosama
[14:26:13] <bot-t> deosama, .removeClass([className]): Remove a single class, multiple classes, or all classes from each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/removeClass/
[14:26:25] <shoky> DeoSama: "each element in the set"
[14:26:29] <FrenlySeal> and before we learn C we must learn assembly?
[14:26:51] <FrenlySeal> and before we learn ASM we should take engineering
[14:27:06] <thesisb> If I do $element.children(), how can I sort that result set in reverse order?
[14:27:07] <FrenlySeal> and before we learn engineering we shud learn math
[14:27:20] <FrenlySeal> and before math we shud lern english
[14:27:22] <shoky> FrenlySeal: stfu
[14:27:25] <FrenlySeal> okok
[14:27:36] <FrenlySeal> i stfu coz hungry
[14:27:40] <FrenlySeal> bai
[14:27:41] <graphettion> FrenlySeal: It's best to learn with a WYSIWYG editor. Fuck this code shit.
[14:27:46] <FrenlySeal> srsly
[14:27:53] <FrenlySeal> graphettion: best teacher
[14:28:01] <FrenlySeal> ^
[14:28:11] <shoky> mmm food
[14:28:14] <graphettion> That was sarcasm, btwq
[14:28:17] <graphettion> btw*
[14:28:53] <mvpgraff> EvilTwin :D
[14:29:08] <mvpgraff> thanks!
[14:29:22] <shoky> thesisb:  $element.children().get().reverse()  gets you a pure array. wrap with $(...) to get it back to a jq obj
[14:29:31] <thesisb> thanks!
[14:29:34] <Eviltwin> Why the reverse?
[14:29:40] <shoky> he asked for it
[14:30:21] <mvpgraff> burnt myself out earlier couldn't think straight
[14:30:44] <Eviltwin> mvpgraff: Well I'd like you to know that the code you were writing was no where close to on the right track syntax-wise
[14:31:00] <Eviltwin> A little beyone "burnt out" and closer to "I have no idea what I'm doing"
[14:31:07] <mvpgraff> rofl
[14:31:12] <thesisb> Eviltwin
[14:31:19] <thesisb> I have a custom context menu in my application
[14:31:29] <thesisb> if its close to the bottom of the screen, I want to open it upwards
[14:31:38] <thesisb> with its elements reversed so theyre technically the same order
[14:31:50] <Eviltwin> Fair enough
[14:31:52] <thesisb> works well
[14:31:55] <thesisb> thanks shoky
[14:33:02] <Eviltwin> Not sure how well-supported it is but I was able to Array.prototype.reverse.call(jqObject)
[14:33:11] <Eviltwin> And reverse it in place
[14:33:32] <thesisb> hm
[14:33:34] <shoky> heh nice
[14:33:48] <thesisb> ill test that on ie8, sec
[14:35:35] <thesisb> worked in ie8
[14:35:45] <thesisb> so keeping the in-place one, thanks
[14:40:52] <Eviltwin> No luck trying to apply it to .childNodes or .children though
[14:43:11] <wc-> hi all, super basic question here, how can i select based on multiple parameteres
[14:43:15] <wc-> like i want to do $("label .checkbox")
[14:43:23] <wc-> to find any label elements with the class checkbox
[14:43:49] <Eviltwin> Label elements with the class checkbox are $("label.checkbox")
[14:43:58] <Eviltwin> What you have is elements that have the class checkbox contained inside a label
[14:44:26] <wc-> label.checkbox did it
[14:44:38] <wc-> im guessing if i wanted labels with the id checkbox i could do label#checkbox?
[14:44:44] <Eviltwin> Yes
[14:44:50] <wc-> and if there is a space between the selectors then it is searchign through children?
[14:44:54] <Eviltwin> Although that will only match at most one element
[14:45:03] <wc-> right
[14:45:12] <Eviltwin> $("#checkbox label") is all labels inside the element with id checkbox
[14:45:23] <Eviltwin> $("label #checkbox") is the element with ID checkbox inside a label (if it exists)
[14:58:37] <FrenlySeal> baaaaaaaaakbooooooooone
[14:58:41] <FrenlySeal> :O
[14:58:57] <FrenlySeal> wwat framwworks u gaize using?

[14:59:07] <FrenlySeal> knockout?
[14:59:24] <RandalSchwartz> jquery :)
[14:59:39] <RandalSchwartz> does jquery play well with bootstrap these days?
[14:59:42] <FrenlySeal> not a fw
[14:59:46] <FrenlySeal> iz lib
[15:00:01] <RandalSchwartz> a framework is just a lib too
[15:00:05] <RandalSchwartz> seems arbitrary
[15:00:11] <PapaSier_> with constraint validation in html5 and invalid input gets a :invalid pseudo class attribute. i have a case where i want to manually add that pseudo class. is that possible? how?
[15:00:13] <FrenlySeal> RandalSchwartz: hell no
[15:00:16] <FrenlySeal> u crazy son

[15:04:55] <RandalSchwartz> Yeah with all of these frameworks, I'm happy to be not writing in Javascript soon :)
[15:05:07] <RandalSchwartz> Dart is a far easier language

[15:22:04] <FrenlySeal> :D
[15:23:22] <shoky> Spawnrj: that's not a valid background-image  (because of the no-repeat)
[15:23:34] <shoky> Spawnrj: either remove the no-repeat  or use background instead of background-image
[15:24:55] <FrenlySeal> Spawnrj: ur css is messed up

[15:45:28] <kavi_> hi am using jquery ui plugin in my app for using dialog form
[15:46:30] <kavi_> i have a main form and from that form am calling the dialog form "creating new project" . After the method is successfull , i want the page to get refresh and stay in the same page
[15:46:45] <kavi_> but it is going to another page . please help
[15:46:47] <kavi_> http://pastebin.com/rEEPA4yk
[15:46:59] <kavi_> this is my code so far
[15:49:09] <ajmrsn> is there a .notHasClass() or something like this?
[15:49:11] <monk3y> kavi_: I haven't used jQuery UI, or whatever plugin you're using, but I don't understand the elements starting with the g: namespace .. however, the form I see in there has action set to "save" .. so it'll be trying to submit to a page called 'save', won't it?
[15:50:04] <monk3y> ajmrsn: it's something (roughly) like $('.[^=class]') (doesn't have class 'class')
[15:50:30] <monk3y> Or..
[15:50:56] <shoky> wat
[15:50:58] <monk3y> ajmrsn: $('element:not(.class)')..
[15:51:10] <ajmrsn> right :not() I just saw it in the docs
[15:51:35] <kavi_> <monk3y> : Yes it is going to that page. how can i prevent that ..? i want the dialog form button "create new project" to save the object and refresh the page
[15:52:00] <kavi_> where can i specify the method it should be called on the dialog form button...
[15:53:04] <monk3y> kavi_: it's because action="save".  You need to make that action="", and it'll submit on itself.
[16:00:27] <Spawnrj> someone could help me, I'm trying to click on the menu to change the background image, to keep active effect.
[16:00:27] <Spawnrj> I have 2 buttons in the header, it is possible to leave active when you click and switch to hover image? http://afsn.com.br/jquery/
[16:00:56] <kavi_> <monk3y> - how will it submit to save by default , the main form needs to go to diff action. ?
[16:01:45] <Spawnrj> how to active background image in menu list
[16:03:08] <kavi_> <monk3y> It has to go to the save method in the controller and come and refresh the main page. If i am not specifying the action it is not going to that method in the controller
[16:06:44] <monk3y> kavi_: oh right.  Then in the 'save' controller, on the last step can't you make it redirect/serve the original page?
[16:07:06] <monk3y> Or depending on your framework - the original 'view'.
[16:07:58] <kavi_> i can do that..will try and see..
[16:08:41] <kavi_> just one more clarification - in this case  do i need to use $.ajax or this will work?
[16:18:14] <Spawnrj> howto Put a background image behind active link on nav bar ...  http://jsfiddle.net/Dk6eq/
[16:19:27] <_jgr> I'm trying to  reset a cloned text input field to no value/text, i've tried attr(), val() and even setAttribute() nothing seems to work
[16:29:46] <nsanden> from what i understand prev(), next(), closest() they all only select 'alike' elements. how can i simply find the element right before $(this) whether its alike or not and using a selector idealy
[16:30:10] <shoky> nsanden: $(this).prev()
[16:30:19] <shoky> donno what you mean by 'alike'
[16:30:31] <grafi> _jgr .val('') maybe?
[16:30:32] <shoky> or why you need to use a selector ideally..
[16:31:46] <_jgr> grafi: I have tried that
[16:33:10] <shoky> _jgr: .val('') works. make a jsfiddle/demo if you have a problem
[16:34:27] <nsanden> shoky: so if i have <span class="test_span">test</span> <a href="#" class="test_link">test</a> $('.test_link').prev('.test_span').hide(); is what id expect would hide the span
[16:35:12] <shoky> nsanden: me too
[16:36:33] <nsanden> oh crap
[16:37:20] <shoky> works too good?
[16:37:29] <grafi> xD
[16:38:38] <nsanden> i see what i did, hard to explain but scope problem
[16:38:59] <grafi> good ol
[16:39:04] <grafi> scope problems
[16:39:46] <nsanden> used $(this).prev('.test_span') which should work but had it in ajax callback
[16:40:04] <_jgr> it's working on jsfiddle but not in my code ._.
[16:40:25] <nsanden> yep worked. thanks shoky
[16:40:38] <grafi> are you sure you have the correct element then _jgr ?
[16:41:38] <_jgr> that's weird
[16:41:47] <_jgr> it's working now using val()
[16:42:04] <grafi> thats my favorite kind of bug ^^
[16:42:08] <_jgr> but wasn't before for some reason, idk I haven't slept much so I probably overlooked something
[16:42:27] <grafi> heisenbug ftw
[16:43:18] <_jgr> lol, thanks anyway
[16:45:47] <frosT_> guys can anybody see what seems to fail here? http://jsfiddle.net/p8ZaC/
[16:46:52] <monk3y> frosT_: what is the error - or what is the expected and actual functionality?
[16:47:08] <frosT_> monk3y:  replace what i have in stack
[16:47:08] <grafi> json.stack is undefined, thats why its falling through to the default ...
[16:47:34] <Pio> i have an $.ajax call that's triggering the error callback with textStatus "error" and errorThrown "" but no actual network connection is shown in the chrome dev tools 'network' tab
[16:47:59] <Pio> anyone know what might cause that? jquery 1.8..
[16:48:04] <grafi> frosT_ try json[0].stack and it will output test (correctly)

[16:54:12] <Spawnrj> how to activate the menu item and change the background image? http://jsfiddle.net/dinho/sNCSQ/
[16:55:13] <Spawnrj> when I click on the menu it does not get the background image selected http://jsfiddle.net/dinho/sNCSQ/
[16:56:37] <grafi> thats because you never give the 'a' a class of active Spawnrj
[16:57:26] <Spawnrj> know how I can do this?
[16:58:12] <Spawnrj> grafi know how I can do this?
[16:59:15] <Wescotte> Anyone recommend any libs that emulate sprintf functionality in javascript?

[17:07:20] <Spawnrj> not work online http://afsn.com.br/jquery/

[17:47:08] <RandalSchwartz> select is not a sibling
[17:47:29] <grafi> use children()
[17:47:32] <RandalSchwartz> foo.find('select')
[17:47:35] <grafi> or that
[17:47:40] <RandalSchwartz> or children() :)
[17:47:48] <grafi> what i said
[17:47:49] <grafi> :P
[17:48:08] <RandalSchwartz> select is a sibling of .br

[17:48:58] <grafi> brrrr
[17:49:11] <rud> thanks
[17:49:25] <RandalSchwartz> tinker.io hasn't been updated recently
[17:49:35] <RandalSchwartz> you might want to play with jsfiddle or jsbin

However, when i change dataType to jsonp it works but its throwing an error because of the <html tag> does anyone know what could be causing this?
[17:56:13] <RandomCouch> justpie Yes, you can't get info from a site that is cross domain
[17:56:21] <RandomCouch> meaning that is not on the same domain as the site trying to get that data
[17:56:26] <RandomCouch> UNLESS, you make a jsonp request
[17:56:29] <sc_> justpie: use yahoo's technology
[17:56:32] <grafi> you can under certain conditions
[17:56:34] <RandomCouch> but then, the server must have support for jsonp
[17:57:03] <RandomCouch> grafi what conditions?
[17:57:16] <grafi> the jsonp api being one
[17:57:32] <grafi> you can also allow cross domain requests manually

[17:57:39] <RandomCouch> Yeah, so far it's the only one I know of, I was wondering if you knew of others
[17:57:46] <RandomCouch> oh how do you do that?
[17:57:54] <shoky> CORS is another way, RandomCouch
[17:57:57] <RandalSchwartz> YQL is amazing
[17:57:59] <shoky> a better way
[17:58:04] <grafi> i think thats what i am talking about
[17:58:07] <RandalSchwartz> I'm surprised the skeleton crew at Yahoo still supports that :)
[17:58:12] <RandalSchwartz> like yahoo pipes
[17:58:12] <grafi> shoky is a god
[17:58:34] <RandalSchwartz> I'm using a yahoo pipe to scrape my G+ public postings
[17:58:36] <RandomCouch> shoky Can you explain a bit or give me a link please
[17:58:39] <RandalSchwartz> haven't found a better way :)
[17:58:55] <grafi> http://enable-cors.org/
[17:58:56] <sc_> RandalSchwartz: same
[17:59:05] <RandalSchwartz> G+ postings -> api -> yahoo pipes -> twitterfeed -> {twitter, facebook}
[17:59:13] <RandomCouch> Thanks grafi
[17:59:20] <sc_> i use php for "heavy" lifting
[17:59:34] <RandomCouch> I've had a problem in the past that revolved around CORS, and I've decided to let it be, until now
[17:59:35] <grafi> np, hope it helps :P
[17:59:42] <RandalSchwartz> I avoid PHP (aka "perl lite") for everything
[18:00:32] <sc_> i like it, because i am simple
[18:00:34] <sc_> :)
[18:00:42] <sc_> http://tt6.net/bet.php
[18:00:46] <sc_> that was a fun project
[18:00:52] <RandomCouch> grafi oh this method only works if you are also the administrator of the server or the api service
[18:01:11] <justpie> sorry, chat crashed. So there is no way to do it via jquery/
[18:01:13] <grafi> how do you figure?
[18:01:18] <shoky> RandomCouch so does JSONP
[18:01:23] <RandomCouch> Yeah I know
[18:01:34] <RandomCouch> That's why I have decided to let my problem go :P
[18:02:00] <RandomCouch> because I wanted access to an API service that didn't support jsonp, and I wondered, how do they run an API service like that with CORS disabled?
[18:02:14] <grafi> yeah
[18:02:24] <RandomCouch> they support xml and json
[18:02:26] <RandomCouch> but not jsonp
[18:02:33] <RandomCouch> how are people querying their database
[18:02:41] <grafi> what service is it? :P
[18:02:46] <shoky> ^
[18:02:48] <RandomCouch> upcdatabase.com
[18:02:57] <RandomCouch> oops sry
[18:02:59] <RandomCouch> upcdatabase.org
[18:03:01] <RandomCouch> not .com
[18:03:24] <grafi> interesting
[18:03:48] <shoky> RandomCouch i didn't check yet, but there are APIs that are meant for your server-side code to access them, not the client
[18:03:48] <RandomCouch> I've tried $.ajax and $.getJSON (jsonp requests)
[18:03:56] <RandomCouch> I always got the json object but, in an error
[18:04:02] <RandalSchwartz> yeah - won't work because of same-site json stuff
[18:04:06] <RandomCouch> and it wasn't wrapped in a jsonp function thing
[18:04:10] <RandalSchwartz> and if they don't provide JSONP, too bad
[18:04:13] <grafi> try writing an angry email ^^
[18:04:15] <RandalSchwartz> have to do that serverside with a proxy
[18:04:28] <grafi> or a friendly one
[18:04:29] <grafi> :P
[18:04:30] <RandomCouch> I'll have to look into that, don't know how to do it
[18:04:38] <RandomCouch> haha grafi yeah friendly ones work better I think
[18:04:54] <RandalSchwartz> your page calls your server at a private url.  your server calls their JSON service, and returns the value
[18:04:55] <grafi> depends on wether you want them to adjust
[18:04:59] <grafi> or just want to vent
[18:04:59] <grafi> :P
[18:05:09] <RandomCouch> Something along the lines of "Hi there, I noticed you have CORS disabled, and as a result I am unable to get any json object from your API service. FIX THAT SHIT"
[18:05:23] <grafi> aint nobody got time for this
[18:05:25] <grafi> ^^
[18:05:47] <RandomCouch> RandalSchwartz sounds very complex
[18:05:57] <RandomCouch> first of all, what do you mean by private url
[18:06:02] <RandomCouch> and how is that supposed to bypass CORS
[18:06:39] <grafi> curl doesnt care about cross domain something something
[18:06:51] <RandomCouch> oh curl... I've heard that term many times before
[18:07:06] <RandomCouch> I have yet to really know what it is. I'm a bit new to all this, came here from game dev
[18:07:08] <shoky> RandomCouch: the SOP issue is only when your browser does the request. (SOP = same origin policy)
[18:07:29] <RandomCouch> ah I see
[18:07:40] <RandomCouch> Suppose I do this request from a mobile app
[18:07:42] <RandomCouch> on a mobile device
[18:07:45] <RandomCouch> would that work?
[18:08:08] <shoky> probably not, if you're using a browser that adheres to SOP
[18:08:22] <RandomCouch> but what if it's an app, made with phonegap
[18:08:44] <shoky> i dunno phonegap
[18:08:44] <RandomCouch> I could test it out, just not now though
[18:08:57] <RandomCouch> shoky it basicly bundles html+css+js into a mobile app
[18:09:03] <grafi> "not now" is where dreams die :P
[18:09:08] <shoky> but a native app surely can access it if it wants to. i think
[18:09:18] <RandomCouch> grafi it's only because my testing device is at my workplace :P
[18:09:22] <RandomCouch> so I can't test it here
[18:09:26] <shoky> donno if phonegap APIs allow it tho
[18:10:12] <RandomCouch> Well, I'm definitely gonna try it out
[18:10:28] <RandomCouch> I'm happy now, I though I'd have to resort to other solutions
[18:10:40] <grafi> dont forget to report back
[18:10:41] <grafi> ^^
[18:10:47] <RandomCouch> well it's still unknown wether it will work or not, but yes I'll let you guys know :)
[18:11:15] <RandomCouch> I'm working on my first mobile app and so far it's been very exciting, and I've learned a lot
[18:11:19] <RandomCouch> including backbone.js
[18:11:39] <RandomCouch> and phonegap/cordova
[18:12:52] <grafi> sounds flashy
[18:12:53] <grafi> :P
[18:13:24] <RandomCouch> hah, well it's just some of the tools I need to get this project done
[18:13:25] <nesoi> In JQM, I'm doing mobile.changePage or just window.location.href to go to a page, the page never loads - there's no pageChange event triggered for the new page. Instead, it goes to a different page. Has anyone seen this or know what to try?
[18:13:28] <RandomCouch> or done right
[18:13:45] <grafi> or done left
[18:13:54] <RandomCouch> just not downwards
[18:13:57] <RandomCouch> cause that would be bad
[18:14:03] <grafi> up would be good
[18:14:07] <RandomCouch> yeah
[18:14:17] <grafi> make another instagram
[18:14:18] <grafi> ^^
[18:14:23] <RandomCouch> rofl
[18:14:26] <RandomCouch> hell naw
[18:15:02] <RandomCouch> the project I'm working on is very promising, and I believe it will sell. But I'm also expecting the worse, which is still not so bad
[18:16:01] <grafi> good luck with that ;)
[18:16:05] <RandomCouch> thanks
[18:16:25] <RandomCouch> I'm mostly interested in the process of development, learning all this cool new stuff
[18:16:38] <grafi> yeah thats fun
[18:17:14] <RandomCouch> like recently I discovered js can do a lot more than I usually thought it does
[18:17:23] <grafi> like what?
[18:17:49] <RandomCouch> well before getting on this project, I had used javascript a bit in browser code and in Unity
[18:18:22] <RandomCouch> I guess I wasn't familiar with everything about js
[18:18:40] <RandomCouch> I can't say that I am now, but I'm more familiar that's for sure
[18:18:52] <grafi> hehe
[18:19:00] <grafi> its a process thats for sure
[18:19:07] <RandomCouch> yep
[18:19:38] <grafi> like everything in life and life itself
[18:19:40] <grafi> ^^
[18:30:58] <nesoi> other than trial and error, how does one know which version of jquery is supported for any given jqm version?
[18:33:18] <grafi> Welcome. jQuery Mobile is the easiest way to build sites and apps that are accessible on all popular smartphone, tablet and desktop devices. For jQuery 1.7.0 to 1.8.3.
[18:35:16] <shoky> nesoi: also check the blog updates for major versions. 1.3.0 release has:  jQuery Mobile 1.3.0 supports versions of jQuery core 1.7.2 – 1.9.1 and we’re actively testing the upcoming 2.0 version too.
[18:36:21] <arschmitz> grafi: shoky: 2.0 is fully supported in master currently and will also be in 1.4 which the alpha will be released in ~3 weeks
[18:36:50] <shoky> goodie
[18:37:23] * grafi slaps nesoi around with a Riemann rearrangement theorem
[18:37:30] <grafi> oops
[18:37:32] <grafi> sry
[18:40:36] <shoky> cool theorem
[18:40:57] <grafi> sure
[18:41:20] <HarryPitfall> good night
[18:41:23] <HarryPitfall> there is a jquery method, that works like extend(), but don't override existing members?
[18:41:41] <grafi> erm...
[18:41:51] <HarryPitfall> kinda like {a:1,b:2}+{a:10,b:20,c:30} -> {a:1,b:2,c:30}
[18:42:15] <HarryPitfall> the result only add non-existing (or dont override), already present members on object
[18:42:27] <RandalSchwartz> reverse the args to extend :)
[18:42:28] <shoky> $.extend({}, {a:10,b:20,c:30}, {a:1,b:2})
[18:42:30] <grafi> yeah
[18:42:31] <shoky> yea ;p
[18:42:38] <grafi> ^^
[18:42:42] <HarryPitfall> I cant do that
[18:42:47] <RandalSchwartz> sure you can
[18:42:53] <grafi> we believe in you
[18:42:53] <HarryPitfall> 'cause the object to extend is a prototype
[18:43:01] <tw2113> very common in plugins that offer defaults that you override
[18:43:07] <HarryPitfall> Array.prototype
[18:43:57] <shoky> $.extend(Array.prototype, yourObj, Array.prototype)  no idea if that works :P
[18:44:33] <grafi> looks dangerous
[18:44:34] <grafi> :P
[18:44:38] <shoky> indeed
[18:46:35] <RandalSchwartz> wondering why you would not want to override
[18:49:50] <shoky> guess he wants to keep the native one if it's there already
[18:50:43] <shoky> don't wanna uproot the natives
[18:51:05] <grafi> how considerate
[18:56:40] <HarryPitfall> exactly shoky
[18:57:01] <HarryPitfall> currently, i have lots of if(!Array.prototype.some_method)...
[18:57:26] <HarryPitfall> and one $.extend(Array.prototype, { things that for sure array dont have });
[18:57:49] <HarryPitfall> if I have a "safe" extend... i just can have one block of code
[18:58:20] <HarryPitfall> I'll need to write my own "extend" for this...
[18:58:53] <RandalSchwartz> but you don't... just swap the args, as we showed
[19:01:32] <nutron> I have an icon in a jquery ui button.  When the pointer is over the icon, it doesn't register as an activation even though the button changes styles when clicked... if I click anywhere but the icon, it works.  Have I done something wrong?
[19:02:18] <RandalSchwartz> what event... "activation"?
[19:02:45] <RandalSchwartz> seems like you just need a click handler.
[19:02:50] <nutron> click I believe
[19:02:56] <karbassi> in a gruntfile.js a plugin asks me to point to the directory i want something to run. How do I give it the current directory the gruntfile.js is in?
[19:02:57] <RandalSchwartz> .on('click', ... )
[19:06:16] <nutron> hmm I must be doing it wrong then...
[19:18:26] <nesoi> is there any issue with a button being an <a> tag but having no href attribute?
[19:18:30] <nesoi> (JQM)
[19:18:37] <nesoi> it seems to work but may be buggy
[19:19:00] <nesoi> I'm just putting an event on it, so I don't care what type of tag it is… should I use a form?
[19:20:39] <blib> if I use replaceWith - with onclick="..." will that work?
[19:20:54] <blib> the functions exist in my JS file. Just am not sure the registration works after the device has been loaded
[19:22:29] <RandalSchwartz> why not attach it with .on('click') ?
[19:23:57] <blib> RandalSchwartz: I had some html code that I am moving into replacewith
[19:24:01] <blib> old code that worked.
[19:29:52] <RandalSchwartz> uh well.  ok.  You have code that worked, but you want to change it.  Do you want to change it so it works, or something else?
[19:30:31] <arschmitz> nesoi: a link with out an href will be buggy unless you add data-ajax false because of the default link binding
[19:43:59] <Cache_Money> .offset() gives me the position of the element from the top of the entire page.  Is there a way to get the position of the element relative to what's visible to the user?
[19:45:45] <nesoi> I'm running into problems with jqm where events are going on too long. For instance, if I tap a button which goes to another screen, and there's a button at the same place on the new screen, that new button also gets a tap event!
[19:46:03] <nesoi> I have stopImmediatePropagation and stopPropagation, but it still is happening. What would anyone suggest?
[19:46:17] <arschmitz> nesoi: use click not tap that is the problem
[19:46:17] <RandalSchwartz> don't have buttons at the same place :)
[19:46:34] <nesoi> these are on the bottom of the screen, where buttons usually are
[19:46:36] <arschmitz> platforms that support tuch have a 300ms delay between events
[19:46:48] <nesoi> apparently not in this case
[19:46:51] <arschmitz> and they fire on whatever is under the touch
[19:47:08] <arschmitz> so it will fire tap start transition then fire click
[19:47:24] <arschmitz> this is the native behivor though its not very friendly
[19:47:32] <nesoi> arschmitz:  so what's the solution?
[19:47:40] <arschmitz> only use click
[19:47:46] <arschmitz> and deal with the 300ms delay
[19:47:59] <arschmitz> click will always fire after tap
[19:48:06] <nesoi> 300ms is too laggy
[19:48:10] <arschmitz> so you dont have to worry about the double events
[19:48:22] <arschmitz> you could bind everything to touchstart
[19:48:33] <nesoi> how would that work?
[19:48:37] <arschmitz> but then you will completely eliminate it from working on any ie or desktop
[19:48:46] <nesoi> this will never need to run on ie or a desktop
[19:48:56] <arschmitz> is it a phonegap app?
[19:49:02] <nesoi> yes :)
[19:49:03] <Cache_Money> For example, say an element has an offset of {top: 1200, left: 200} but I've scrolled down 400px, so I'd like to be able to know the element is 800 from the browser window
[19:49:36] <arschmitz> nesoi: then yes as long as your platforms are WK only touchstart will work for you
[19:49:48] <vsync_> Cache_Money: there were some viewport scripts
[19:49:57] <vsync_> but not sure if that's possible even with those
[19:50:03] <vsync_> maybe
[19:50:40] <nesoi> arschmitz:  so how would that work?
[19:50:53] <Cache_Money> vsync_: I'm trying to determine if there's enough room above an element to pop a tooltip above it, otherwise, I'm going to pop it below the elem
[19:51:02] <arschmitz> you will have to disable default link handling and bind all your own events
[19:51:13] <nesoi> that's what I'm dong now
[19:51:21] <arschmitz> ok
[19:51:25] <nesoi> well, I didn't disable anything but I'm handling all my own events
[19:51:36] <arschmitz> thats part of your problem too
[19:51:42] <arschmitz> need to disable link handling
[19:52:00] <nesoi> if I have no href in a button it wouldn't matter would it?
[19:52:55] <nesoi> so what about touchstart?
[19:53:13] <nesoi> arschmitz: ?
[19:53:23] <arschmitz> yes
[19:53:29] <arschmitz> it still matters
[19:53:32] <nesoi> what are you suggesting with touchstart?
[19:54:36] <arschmitz> first set linkBindingEnabled to false on mobile init
[19:55:12] <hisa_py> hi guys, how can I make $.ajax to https?
[19:55:25] <arschmitz> then you will need to $.document.on("touchstart","a", function( e ) { //handle link here });
[19:57:55] <hisa_py> I'm trying to make this ajax https://gist.github.com/hisapy/5828514
[19:58:28] <nesoi> arschmitz:  hmm. interesting. what would I do on touchstart that would debounce?
[19:58:49] <hisa_py> but it only works if I navigate to the page and then accept the certificate manually
[20:02:28] <nesoi> hmm… maybe preventDefault fixed it?
[20:03:18] <arschmitz> nesoi: yes
[20:03:42] <nesoi> arschmitz:  so what would I do in that touchstart code that would debounce?
[20:09:38] <arschmitz> nesoi: sorry ill be back shortly need to take care of something
[20:09:48] <nesoi> ok
[20:17:20] <Thump_> hey, where do i go to ask about photoshop question?

[21:34:19] <ProLoser> anyone here use github + chrome?
[21:57:34] <monk3y> eN_Joy: still around?
[22:59:21] <thebigkiwi> has anyone used jquery.screen? have some paid work i need done rather urgently
[23:01:21] <cusco> never to be honest
[23:01:52] <cusco> but your money is a strong... reason to be willing to look at it
[23:02:05] <cusco> however I don't thin the trouble is
[23:05:34] <thebigkiwi> Yeah for some reason it seems to be calculating the wrong values, or at least there are some conflicting values
[23:40:09] <b0nes> Hello
[23:40:15] <b0nes> can anyone help me
[23:40:17] <b0nes> http://jsfiddle.net/kP7KQ/
[23:41:02] <b0nes> i need to remove the array if its has the same value on the other array
[23:41:17] <b0nes> and push the it into the new array
[23:42:16] <b0nes> so that the values of the new array will be ['caty','cowhead', 'pussy','hakuna', 'cow']
[23:42:22] <b0nes> without the cat and dog
[23:42:40] <b0nes> since its duplicated in the master array
[23:44:29] <bobbyhay> indexOf?
[23:45:30] <bobbyhay> jQuery Mobile Q: if I add tr's to a table, can I tell jQM to update just that section of the page?
[23:45:57] <bobbyhay> because atm I'm just hitting $('#page').trigger('create');
[23:46:11] <bobbyhay> feels pretty heavy on mobile
[23:52:41] <bobbyhay> never mind, you don't need to do that
[23:54:42] <Niels___> i'm trying to open hrefs and submitted forms inside a already open modal. i'm using zurb foundation reveal/modal, any clues if that's easily doable?
