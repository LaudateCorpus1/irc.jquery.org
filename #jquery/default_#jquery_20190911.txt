[04:38:31] <Paradisee> hello guys
[04:38:58] <Paradisee> is there a way to have getJSON sync ?
[04:39:34] <Cork> if it isn't jsonp, yes but don't
[04:39:51] <Cork> it will block the browser from executing until the server responds
[04:40:08] <Paradisee> well, i need to make some kind of callback
[04:40:15] <Cork> it is better to use deferred to forward the data
[04:40:20] <Paradisee> i have an init function that runs some functions
[04:40:33] <Paradisee> but the one having getJSON gives me troubles
[04:40:37] <Cork> just do .done(function(data) { run here });
[04:41:04] <Paradisee> i don't want the main code in the getJSON function
[04:41:10] <Cork> you don't need to
[04:41:23] <Cork> just return the jqxhr object to the caller
[04:41:31] <Cork> then you can add .done() there
[04:42:16] <Paradisee> any example?
[04:42:55] <Cork> function a() { return $.getJSON(url); };  a().done(function(json) { do things });
[04:43:25] <Paradisee> nice, thanks
[04:43:27] <Paradisee> im gonna try
[06:23:48] <Paradisee> ever used handlebars?
[06:24:29] <thykka> mustache is nice
[09:33:38] <EngageMan> Hi all, having some issues with the ThemeRoller
[09:34:02] <EngageMan> When I make changes to the theme the changes are not saved and I cannot export the theme with my changes.
[10:33:37] <Paradisee> is there a function on an ajax call that i can use even if the call is ok or have failed?
[10:35:12] <makr8100> $.ajax({/* ajax object */}).done(function() { /* success */ }).fail(function() { /* error */ });
[10:35:46] <Paradisee> i dont want to repeat code
[10:35:57] <Paradisee> and i have a code that must be repeated in the done and fail function
[10:50:03] <briian> Paradisee: $.ajax({ ..., success: {}, error: {}, complete: {} })?
[10:50:17] <briian> oh waiyt
[10:50:28] <briian> you can use .always()
[10:52:47] <makr8100> right, depends on jquery verion too, but the preferred way is the .always().done().fail() callbacks
[12:25:05] <nnyby> is jquery UI still maintained?
[12:25:40] <robertmaxrees> nnyby ish: https://blog.jqueryui.com/2017/12/the-future-of-jquery-ui-and-jquery-mobile/
[12:25:49] <nnyby> thx
[12:26:00] <robertmaxrees> why do you ask?
[12:28:17] <nnyby> because i work on a django web app that uses jquery UI (https://mediathread.info/)  Just wondering if we can count on this to be maintained upstream or if we should slowly plan on phasing out jquery UI eventually
[12:28:43] <robertmaxrees> ah.  depending on how active that app is, I might migrate to something more "modern".
[12:31:25] <nnyby> is no one accepting jquery UI prs? looks like nothing's been merged since 2017
[12:31:39] <robertmaxrees> heh, did you read the blog post? :)
[12:33:15] <nnyby> yeah. it's unclear if they're accepting changes or not
[12:33:27] <robertmaxrees> they basically aren't.
[12:34:12] <nnyby> i see. i understand there's a lack of resources.. but they also express interest in new maintainers taking over. i suppose that's always a possibility?
[12:34:30] <nnyby> nvm, it's all in the blog post lol
[12:35:04] <nnyby> i guess i just assumed that someone at jquery would accept basic PRs here just to keep the test suites running and stuff
[12:35:26] <robertmaxrees> heh
[12:35:42] <robertmaxrees> long story short, the intent was to completely rearchitect jquery ui and jquery mobile, then the foundation changed a whole bunch and things basically died.
[12:36:20] <nnyby> i see
[12:40:09] <robertmaxrees> also: i'd consider rebuilding in a way that makes it easier to swap out frontend frameworks in the first place.  that way it doesn't matter as much if you need to migrate again.
[12:44:07] <nnyby> yeah.. i think mediathread only uses a few parts of jquery UI, it's not that deeply tied to it. just a few jquery-ui tabs interfaces here and there that can be easily swapped out
[13:19:12] <TheMillionthSara> Hello, I'm in need of help on the Themeroller portion of the website. Is anyone able to help?
[13:19:49] <robertmaxrees> TheMillionthSara dont ask to ask - if you have a question, ask it.  if somebody can help, they will :)
[13:21:20] <TheMillionthSara> Well, I had messaged earlier but no one responded so I was testing the waters again. When I'm going into the ThemeRoller setup, I'm adding in my hex colors, etc, the preview portion just goes grey and when I try to download it does not allow me to download 1.10.4
[13:21:38] <robertmaxrees> link?

[13:22:55] <robertmaxrees> ah, the error page?
[13:23:05] <TheMillionthSara> No error pages are being presented
[13:23:18] <TheMillionthSara> It just greys out the preview bit. Let me get a screenshot, just a mo
[13:24:08] <TheMillionthSara> https://imgur.com/pMwGIyy
[13:24:30] <nnyby> hmmm, jQuery UI is unmaintained, so i imagine the themeroller has some bugs. i'm surprised this is still up with no deprecation notice
[13:24:45] <nnyby> TheMillionthSara: are there any errors in the JS console? ctrl+shift+I
[13:24:48] <robertmaxrees> thebetra1 well
[13:24:51] <robertmaxrees> https://i.imgur.com/u63EcrN.png
[13:24:57] <robertmaxrees> report the issue TheMillionthSara :)
[13:25:11] <robertmaxrees> woops sorry
[13:25:22] <TheMillionthSara> nnyby Yes, looks like it
[13:25:27] <TheMillionthSara> Just a mo

[13:25:45] <robertmaxrees> yeha, pop in an issue in github TheMillionthSara
[13:26:10] <TheMillionthSara> Okay, thanks all!
[13:27:15] <nnyby> similar error already here: https://github.com/jquery/download.jqueryui.com/issues/359
[13:27:40] <nnyby> yea, looks like everyones running into this lol
[13:27:41] <TheMillionthSara> Yep, just saw that one too
[13:27:45] <robertmaxrees> comment on it then :)
[13:30:50] <nnyby> idk if another comment will make a difference at this point.. who is responsible for this repo? looks like jquery needs more maintainers :P sign me up! @nikolas on github
[13:30:59] <robertmaxrees> heh
[13:31:03] <robertmaxrees> the js foundation ;)
[13:31:52] <robertmaxrees> jquery UI and jquery are different teams.
[13:32:00] <robertmaxrees> JQUI is in a unique spot.
[13:32:14] <robertmaxrees> check out https://blog.jqueryui.com/2017/12/the-future-of-jquery-ui-and-jquery-mobile/
[13:32:19] <robertmaxrees> and nnyby another comment always helps.
[16:14:05] <Es0teric> i have a question -- https://kopy.io/tIupa i have that code but when I try to make an on click event for it it will not work and output the console log
[16:14:18] <Es0teric> an on click event for the .dupe_artist_name which is on line 18
[16:15:33] <Es0teric> why is that?
[16:22:36] <Es0teric> anyone?
[16:24:39] <nnyby> Es0teric: try stackoverflow
[16:24:52] <nnyby> if no one can help you here
[16:24:57] <Es0teric> yeah
[16:25:16] <nnyby> looks like you need a $(document).ready() though
[16:25:44] <Es0teric> why would i need document.ready() though?
[16:25:45] <nnyby> you can't bind to a dom element that isn't ready yet
[16:26:10] <nnyby> you need to wait until the page tells your javascript, "okay, ready for events to be attached to the dom"
[16:26:54] <nnyby> https://learn.jquery.com/using-jquery-core/document-ready/
[16:27:24] <Es0teric> nnyby i am dynamically generating what i want to click on
[16:28:34] <nnyby> i would still register the event handler inside a $(document).ready() just to be safe
[16:29:31] <nnyby> because you need to bind it to at least a static root
[16:29:43] <nnyby> i.e. https://stackoverflow.com/a/1207393/173630
[16:41:54] <Es0teric> nnyby i figured it out
[21:09:16] <audioburn> can someone help me understand why my site, apollius.com, doesnt load in IE?
