[00:00:02] <jqueryius> and the .DataTable() does the rest
[00:00:14] <doug16k> ok, then you need to add a <tfoot> inside the table, then you'll get the footerCallback
[00:00:36] <doug16k> <tfoot>...</tfoot>
[00:00:58] <doug16k> maybe an empty tfoot is adequate
[00:01:22] <jqueryius> okay, let me try
[00:01:27] <jqueryius> once I have the tfoot, then what though?
[00:01:53] <doug16k> then, in footerCallback you can set those elements from the callback parameters
[00:02:37] <jqueryius> actually, didn't do anything
[00:02:51] <jqueryius> it seems to be adding the paging, etc as another <tr> row in tbody
[00:07:37] <doug16k> jqueryius, the tfoot probably needs a tr and in the tr, some td's
[00:07:48] <doug16k> or one td with an appropriate colspan
[00:08:08] <jqueryius> and I just put the id's in manually?
[00:08:23] <jqueryius> so I basically recreate it myself? and that overrides datatables doing it automatically?
[00:08:32] <doug16k> you will have control of how it looks - in the footerCallback
[00:09:04] <fattest> when I click a div, i want the radio button inside the div to be checked. What am I doing wrong? http://jsfiddle.net/56uybb7h/1/
[00:09:07] <doug16k> then you can put a known class name on the appropriate elemtns, and set them in footerCallback
[00:09:31] <doug16k> jqueryius, footerCallback is passed parameters that give you the page count and current page, etc
[00:09:46] <doug16k> then you can just .find and .text in the information
[00:10:09] <jqueryius> but what about the page numbers and the "1 to 10 of 10 tasks" type things
[00:10:29] <jqueryius> even though I have the numbers, do I have to generate the actual pagination layout etc myself
[00:10:54] <fattest> never mind fixed it
[00:11:24] <rbo> doug16k, i'm bored ... lol http://biztagram.com/playground/jquery/flickr.html
[00:11:52] <doug16k> jqueryius, there is a theme system built in too https://datatables.net/manual/styling/
[00:11:58] <doug16k> it might be a cleaner way to customize it
[00:12:02] <rbo> now to make a search box that can load images by tags
[00:12:43] <doug16k> jqueryius, you might be able to use pure css to rearrange those elements too
[00:12:52] <jqueryius> doug16k i think that might be easier
[00:12:57] <jqueryius> to use a jquery solution
[00:15:05] <doug16k> jqueryius, the way this thing works is a common pattern: the plugin draws it, but gives you an opportunity to make changes in a "draw" or "render" callback of some kind. that is what that footerCallback is
[00:15:45] <jqueryius> but in that callback, how do I take #tasks-table_info and say "put it where #tasks-table_paginate" is
[00:16:28] <narcarsiss> Sorry To interupt. I have a script that Loads an Image. But if the Image is .exe It gives error as Extected. But it displays an Image container. What is the thingy to Hide this or not Display one at all if Error?
[00:16:39] <doug16k> jqueryius, appending an element that is already in the DOM moves it
[00:17:12] <doug16k> append B to A's parent, and append A to B's parent
[00:17:38] <rbo> meh
[00:17:43] <rbo> 5 hours to wake up for work tomorrow.
[00:17:57] <doug16k> narcarsiss, loads it how? by setting an <img> tag src attribute?
[00:18:12] <rbo> Don't love life till i can code professionally.
[00:18:20] <rbo> Night all thanks again doug16k !
[00:18:30] <doug16k> rbo, good night, np
[00:21:17] <narcarsiss> doug16k: if i load an Image it makes a Container and puts it on screen. but if I load an .exe file (testing security). It still displays a container (created in JQuery). instead of not displaying one.  See this Jsfiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/15fk330g/
[00:22:20] <narcarsiss> the image is populated into the red Container.
[00:22:35] <narcarsiss> But even if it's not an Image a container is still produced.
[00:25:17] <narcarsiss> doug16k: any ideas? My Jquery is bad. Only been dabbing in it for a few days
[00:26:54] <doug16k> narcarsiss, see around line 35 http://jsfiddle.net/15fk330g/2/
[00:27:32] <doug16k> it doesnt work though, there are other errors. make sure you look at the debugger console the moment anything doesnt work
[00:27:42] <doug16k> narcarsiss, F12, Console
[00:28:16] <sheeny> Could anyone help me get my data params correctly formatted for my ajax request: https://gist.github.com/craigsheen/b309f7aba7c40ed5acf2
[00:28:38] <narcarsiss> doug16k: oh sweet cheers :) not to analyse your code.
[00:28:46] <narcarsiss> now*
[00:29:43] <doug16k> narcarsiss, avoid adding event handlers in the html like the plague. onchange is from 1992 or so
[00:30:13] <doug16k> narcarsiss, use .on to attach event handlers
[00:30:36] <sheeny> doug16k narcarsiss unless your "cool" and using react ;P
[00:31:00] <doug16k> narcarsiss, you use chrome?
[00:31:01] <narcarsiss> God a good book I should Pick up?
[00:31:59] <narcarsiss> doug16k:  chrome/FF atm. as i'm just learning new things
[00:32:06] <narcarsiss> got*
[00:32:40] <doug16k> in chrome, press F12 to enable the debugger, click Sources at the top, and at the top right, there is a little stop sign shaped icon with a pause icon in it, click that stop sign icon thing
[00:32:50] <doug16k> it makes it stop at errors, so you can see what is going on
[00:33:31] <doug16k> then click run and it will show you the errors
[00:34:03] <doug16k> almost always, leave "stop on caught exceptions" unchecked
[00:34:32] <doug16k> if you want fully paranoid stop at every error, check it. it is rarely needed though
[00:35:01] <doug16k> one or two errors in jquery can happen, when it is detecting browser bugs
[00:35:12] <doug16k> but they are caught. leaving that unchecked will ignore them
[00:35:37] <doug16k> narcarsiss, ^
[00:37:49] <narcarsiss> oh wow, that's handy
[00:37:53] <doug16k> narcarsiss, ah, you are reading it with a file reader
[00:38:06] <doug16k> then you probably want to use a data url
[00:38:21] <doug16k> ah it already is
[00:38:47] <narcarsiss> yeah It's only to be Stored on screen. so i dont have to "actually" upload it.
[00:40:25] <narcarsiss> HAHAAAA!! IT WORKS! doug16k: Thank You Sooo Much :)
[00:40:38] <narcarsiss> and no errors now.
[00:43:23] <doug16k> narcarsiss, roughly working http://jsfiddle.net/15fk330g/3/
[00:43:35] <doug16k> didn't fix everything though
[00:43:45] <doug16k> but the part you needed is working
[00:44:53] <doug16k> narcarsiss, ah missed your message earlier. nice
[00:46:36] <narcarsiss> doug16k: nice. some of your changes are the same as mine.
[01:11:37] <abishek> i get an error "object is not a function" on https://github.com/hirokiosame/search.js/blob/master/lib/js/search.js#L503. Could someone advice on what the error is
[01:12:33] <Cork> abishek: check what e.target is
[01:12:47] <abishek> Cork, I get the correct object
[01:12:53] <Cork> object?
[01:12:59] <Cork> it shouldn't be an object
[01:13:28] <Cork> it should be a dom element
[01:13:41] <abishek> Cork [<input autocomplete="off" type="text" name="key" class="ui-autocomplete-input">]
[01:14:29] <Cork> ya, that's wrong
[01:14:40] <Cork> try $(e.target[0])
[01:14:45] <abishek> ok
[01:16:05] <rbo> Hey can anyone recommend me a really good jQuery book
[01:38:10] <sheeny> Could anyone help with formatting params in an ajax data? https://gist.github.com/craigsheen/b309f7aba7c40ed5acf2
[01:40:42] <Zumochi> Is it possible to slide between table columns? E.g. hide 3-5 and only show 1-2, then click an arrow and go one column to the right, so that 1 and 4-5 are hidden and only 2-3 are shown?
[01:46:34] <Omar-> good morning!
[01:47:31] <AdamPDotty> sheeny: you do not need parseJSON
[01:47:52] <AdamPDotty> and I get what one would expect
[01:48:12] <AdamPDotty> that is attributes as array not object
[01:48:45] <AdamPDotty> Zumochi: yes
[01:49:37] <Zumochi> Great :) Any advice on how I should do/try that?
[01:50:06] <sheeny> AdamPDotty: is there a way to force it to what i expect? weirdly i have a form for this on another page and it works the other way
[01:51:58] <AdamPDotty> Zumochi: I do not know all the plugins. Quite possible, there is a ready solution, but it would not be hard to implement (depending on flexibility).
[01:52:24] <AdamPDotty> The arrow would be a button, then you use hide() and show().
[01:52:45] <AdamPDotty> You just need to manipulate two elements for each step.
[01:53:13] <Zumochi> Aah, looks like I found something that comes very close to what I'm looking for http://jsfiddle.net/nheldman/GB7Hc/3/
[01:56:16] <AdamPDotty> sheeny: As I said, for me it works here. I remember having a similiar problem when parsing the result with an android app though.
[02:03:54] <Mement> Not sure why sortable does not work in JsFiddle, it does work in my project tho. However, I need to change the id name whenever a li item is dragged onto a different position. I.e., the li item on the first position has the id name 'nav-page-0' and when it is dragged to the third position, it's id name will be 'nav-page-2' and the other li items will get renamed aswell. Have a look here: http://jsfiddle.net/m2mp0jn9/
[02:04:04] <Mement> How can I approach this?
[02:06:13] <narcarsiss> doug16k: You still about?
[02:08:40] <kokut> Hello, anyone knows how to get everything inside a <select> ? I'm using .html but it's not working :\
[02:10:43] <Omar-> kokut .html() returns string. If you want jQuery Object, use .children() / .content() / $("select *")
[02:11:01] <Omar-> there are many methods to get children/content of a div
[02:11:33] <kokut> Hello Omar- yes i was thinking about a string solution because i need to prepend something to that string (a new item)
[02:11:34] <Omar-> !api contents() @ kokut
[02:11:34] <b-ot> kokut: No matches.
[02:11:40] <Omar-> !api contents()
[02:11:40] <b-ot> Omar-: No matches.
[02:12:27] <Omar-> kokut you can convert that string into jQ object, just but it inside $()
[02:12:59] <Omar-> var foo = $("bar").contents(); $(foo).find("x").prepend("y");
[02:13:06] <kokut> i was thinking i could get all the values inside the select (the options) into a var and then add them to my item and then switch it for the original, using strings instead of objects seems reasonable i guess?
[02:13:22] <kokut> well that looks much better
[02:13:42] <Omar-> or use .children()
[02:13:57] <Omar-> !api children() @ kokut
[02:13:58] <b-ot> kokut: No matches.
[02:14:02] <Omar-> !api children @ kokut
[02:14:03] <b-ot> kokut: .children(): Get the children of each element in the set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/children/
[02:14:17] <kokut> but i dont know how to work with objects in jquery i would rather use them as strings?
[02:14:33] <Omar-> kokut create a fiddle and I will show you how
[02:15:02] <kokut> wait let me try what that solution with find and prepend
[02:16:04] <AdamPDotty> Mement: probably XY problem
[02:17:25] <caper> hey any one familiar with bandwidth api
[02:18:20] <Uhkis> !ask
[02:18:20] <b-ot> Uhkis: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[02:20:12] <kokut> Omar-: how would you do it with children? i dont think find is the best approach because the list contents (options) are dynamic
[02:21:44] <kokut> mmh maybe i could just add a selected value that doesn't exist or something
[02:23:22] <caper> how can i get the order-id in bandwidth
[02:31:22] -kornbluth.freenode.net- [freenode-info] why register and identify? your IRC nick is how people know you. http://freenode.net/faq.shtml#nicksetup
[02:32:01] <kokut> Omar-: it worked, with #id:first-child .prepend (string) :)
[02:32:01] <Omar-> kokut $("select").prepend("<option value='foo'>Foo</option>")
[02:32:10] <Omar-> this will become first option
[02:32:48] <kokut> yea it worked, now i need to make it the selected option
[02:35:47] <kokut> k i found it $(id).val(val); :) ty
[02:36:25] <Omar-> nights if (b.length == 0) { delete Object['param2'] }
[02:36:45] <nights> hmm
[02:36:51] <nights> but i dont have a list from which i can remove
[02:36:58] <Omar-> kokut you meant set value of a select programmatically
[02:45:02] <narcarsiss> Trying to get this to work: $('blah img:last-child', this).remove(); It's removing an element but not the last placed " element.append(name);
[02:48:54] <AdamPDotty> are you aware, this is equivalent to this.find('blah').find('img:last-child').remove(); ?
[02:49:21] <AdamPDotty> or $(this).find ...
[02:52:50] <narcarsiss> AdamPDotty: I am not.  sorry. New to JQuery
[02:53:10] <Omar-> narcarsiss have you tried $('blah img', this).last().remove()
[02:53:28] <Omar-> !api last
[02:53:29] <b-ot> Omar-: .last(): Reduce the set of matched elements to the final one in the set. http://api.jquery.com/last/
[02:53:31] <narcarsiss> Here is a JS fidle of my Issue: http://jsfiddle.net/3qbkgozu/3/     Cant remove element if it's not an Image. Like a exe file. the image icon loads but it should not and just throw error
[02:53:41] <narcarsiss> Omar-: Yes.
[02:54:49] <narcarsiss> it remove the Last element. but if it's not an Image file. It does not remove it.  the SRC="" is filled with data:application
[02:56:02] <Omar-> narcarsiss $('blah img', this) returns img tags only
[02:56:16] <Turaylon> guys, is somewhere a good documentation for building package with laravel5?
[02:56:31] <Chulbul> unable to implement jquery validation on bootstrap datetimepicker.
[02:56:58] <Chulbul> other validations are working fine
[02:57:12] <Omar-> narcarsiss $('blah > :last-child', this) returns last child regardless the type
[02:57:14] <narcarsiss> Omar-: My understanding that is Correct. I was using that to Remove the Last uploaded image. The Error does Trigger. but does not remove the non image file container
[02:57:20] <Chulbul> with bootstrap datetimepicker input fields, there isn't any error
[03:00:17] <narcarsiss> Omar-:  Here is a image of the output i'm getting: http://s28.postimg.org/l8up8fmwt/Screenshot_135.png    That last file is an .exe the container should never load.
[03:01:06] <narcarsiss> High Res: http://postimg.org/image/llm3em56h/full/
[03:01:54] <workerbeetwo> Hi.  how do I select <tag  class="A" ><li class="B C"><a class="E F"> compare this selection text value </a> ?
[03:05:54] <AdamPDotty> $('tag.A').find('li.B.C').find('a.E.F')
[03:18:20] <Omar-> narcarsiss you mean the exe file is being added by itself?
[03:19:01] <narcarsiss> The image container is yes.  even the the exe is not meant to be added
[03:19:54] <narcarsiss> the check should be like (is image? yes>add  No>dont add image container)
[03:30:58] <neredsenvy> I'm trying to build sort of a visual-form-builder. I have <div><select></div> where you select the type for form field you would like to add to the form and then I have <div id="out"> where I would like to inject my new-form template which for instance for a Heading looks like this: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/240a416c08c7c22c1fd1 Is there a way I can keep that in a separate JS file and inject it into my <div id="out"> including 
[03:31:58] <psykrsna> neredsenvy, looking at the gist
[03:33:42] <psykrsna> neredsenvy, the gist looks fine. What is the problem?
[03:34:42] <neredsenvy> I idea is to be able to build a form. Select element fill in default value & unique field name send it to background where PHP handles the rest. However I have few templates like what I have in the pasted GIST is there a way to put that in a html file or js object and inject it all into my view.
[03:36:04] <psykrsna> Why don't you return HTML data from the backend?
[03:36:21] <neredsenvy> ?
[03:36:30] <neredsenvy> Because fields do not exist yet ?
[03:37:17] <neredsenvy> I think I found it .load would be something that I would need
[03:37:42] <psykrsna> You can return send HTML data in a JSON variable if you want as well
[03:53:12] <neredsenvy> I see that .load has option to pass data to html file that it's calling .load('file', { }, func()) how do I access the { } data in the file ?
[03:53:56] <neredsenvy> Or is that just for .php files ?
[03:57:42] <psykrsna> neredsenvy, let me get this straight
[03:58:05] <psykrsna> You want to send some data along to your server file right?
[03:58:38] <psykrsna> What are you using in the backend?
[03:59:01] <neredsenvy> I have /builder/titles.html file that I load into my view using .load() I'm asking if I can pass any data to the titles.html before it's injected into my main view
[04:00:10] <psykrsna> You'll have to use a scripting language to do that, either PHP or Python
[04:00:30] <psykrsna> Are your files completely static?
[04:01:01] <neredsenvy> yup
[04:01:49] <psykrsna> You can probably try this: /builder/titles1.html
[04:02:05] <psykrsna> and /builder/titles2.html
[04:02:20] <psykrsna> and so on, and load the one depending on the option selected
[04:05:48] <psykrsna> MSG neredsenvy Did it solve it?
[04:06:13] <neredsenvy> No since I have to pass a value to that file
[04:06:23] <neredsenvy> value changes I can't hardcode it
[04:08:23] <neredsenvy> I will have to to ajax request and load the view from backend
[04:09:19] <psykrsna> .load() is also a form of ajax request
[04:20:08] <esko> i need a restapi for my local mongodb so i can post some stuff to it, suggestions?
[04:21:51] <Cyclohexane> is there a way of saying send an ajax request every x seconds or wait until the previous has finished? because on a slow connection sending every 5 secs just spams the server
[05:04:44] <workerbeetwo> AdamPDotty: thank you very much.
[05:05:52] <sacho> Cyclohexane, memoize a promise and return it
[05:07:58] <sacho> e.g. var await = null; function every5() { if (!await) {await = get(); await.then(function success() { await = null });} return await; } function get() { return $.ajax() }
[05:18:33] <Cyclohexane> sacho: awesome i'll give it a try thanks
[06:38:32] <bbclover> hi guys I have a dilema
[07:14:30] <notchris> Hello all
[07:16:42] <bl4ckdu5t> hi notchris
[07:16:50] <notchris> hey bl4ckdu5t
[07:17:36] <notchris> I’m using Facebooks JS SDK. I have been able to load my page feed without an issue for a few days. Today it will not show, although no errors are reported.
[07:17:46] <notchris> Site: http://www.ctsciencecenter.org/dev/
[07:18:09] <notchris> Not sure what steps I should take to resolve this
[07:20:58] <bbclover> guys, if I use an ajax call, in my success (response): I can't use this to refer to the context I was in before I made the ajax call so I do something ghetto like var self = this; before I make my call, and use self to do things in the success. Is there a better way to did this?
[07:25:21] <bl4ckdu5t> bbclover: $(this) would have changed so that's the best option I can't think of (store it in a variable)
[07:28:24] <bl4ckdu5t> notchris: you use some soughta template engine ?
[07:28:30] <bbclover> hmm I thought there was a way to tell it to give me this context back in the response
[07:28:39] <bl4ckdu5t> I see {{ html message }}
[07:28:50] <bl4ckdu5t> That should echo the message I guess
[07:29:02] <notchris> bl4ckdu5t: Yes I am
[07:29:09] <bl4ckdu5t> so that's what's not been parsed properly (not a JS problem really)
[07:29:20] <notchris> bl4ckdu5t: It’s been working correctly for days now
[07:29:22] <bbclover> so maybe the response could call on everything in the original context (but maybe that's redundant)
[07:29:36] <notchris> bl4ckdu5t: But today I come into the office and nothing..
[07:29:42] <bbclover> but actually I don't know how javascript works... is there a heap? will it actually copy objects or will it just be references?
[07:31:49] <bl4ckdu5t> I'm not sure exactly bbclover but that's how I've always gone about it
[07:32:18] <bl4ckdu5t> notchris: try changing {{html message}} to {{ html message }}
[07:32:33] <bl4ckdu5t> I'm only guessing that'll work
[07:33:29] <notchris> bl4ckdu5t: No luck
[07:34:08] <codeshah> hey guys, can I change the query param in my URL dynamially? [without refreshing the page]
[07:54:05] <jeroenem> hi guys, i'm trying to put my JSON Data into a select dropdown for each continent containing it's countries - i can't figure out how to do this http://jsfiddle.net/0pwymgjc/
[07:58:47] <DarsVaeda> is it possible to have "arrays" in attributes like with form fields?
[08:04:13] <asheinfeld> Hello all, can anyone tell me what i'm doing wrong in this $.ajax request? I clearly see the response in the chrome dev tools but the "then" block is never called! -> http://pastebin.com/bGgRjmUC
[08:04:55] <Tennis> This chunk of code is causing me issues http://paste.ee/p/btibY It's a color picker from a chatroom. Full code js page here http://paste.ee/p/sNkH6 . Can anyone see anything that stands out as wrong?
[08:06:00] <_DB> ive got a problem with a plugin im using its a autofill location plugin basically i want to change its value manually when the user clicks something but I cant
[08:06:02] <Tennis> pastebin is blocked on my network :(
[08:06:15] <_DB> im guessing its because when you type something it generates new values for it
[08:06:41] <_DB> the only time I can change its value is when the page loads using value="in here"
[08:07:01] <_DB> when I use $(;#id').val(new val) it doesnt change
[08:07:13] <_DB> (blah you know what I mean)
[08:08:35] <bbclover> hmm where is robertmarxees today
[08:08:49] <bl4ckdu5t> jeroenem: use ajax
[08:09:19] <bbclover> whois robertmaxrees
[08:09:20] <bbclover> err
[08:09:25] <jeroenem> bl4ckdu5t: i get stuck with the each loop
[08:09:44] <jeroenem> jeroenem: i cant find an example with nested data
[08:10:51] <jeroenem> the idea is as follows: there is a world map,  when you click on a continent - i need the JSON to get all the countries from the specific continent and display them as a select dropdownlist
[08:13:55] <_DB> lol
[08:21:13] <NoiseEee> jeroenem: it doesn't help that you don't already have them organized by continent; the structure is less than optimal for what you want to do (but still possible, just expensive)
[08:22:21] <jeroenem> NoiseEee: Do you suggest making seperate JSON files for each continent containing the countries?
[08:23:49] <NoiseEee> no, it would be nice to have {"europe" : [{"Code": "AUT","Title": "AUSTRIA","ID": "8"},{ //next country }]}   for example
[08:23:59] <NoiseEee> same JSON resource
[08:24:33] <NoiseEee> alternatively you could create that object yourself once you load the JSON and keep it as an index to reference
[08:24:46] <NoiseEee> depends on the control you have of the original JSON resource
[08:25:35] <jeroenem> NoiseEee: ah i see, i think i'm going to change my JSON output as you suggested, thanks!
[08:26:18] <NoiseEee> np good lucjk
[08:26:20] <NoiseEee> luck
[08:41:48] <marc_v92> Is there an option when using jQuery dropdowns to have the dropdown open to the bottom-left of the button instead of the bottom-right?
[08:49:08] <jeroenem> how come this json isnt being loaded, it doesnt return an error neither :/ http://jsfiddle.net/q2ws78ta/1/
[08:49:24] <robertmaxrees> that's now how getJson works.
[08:49:35] <robertmaxrees> *not how, rather
[08:50:30] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/q2ws78ta/3/
[08:54:06] <jeroenem> robertmaxrees:  what i the json is loaded from an URL? Can i replace the variable json with the URL?
[08:54:13] <jeroenem> what if*
[08:54:29] <robertmaxrees> your code should work-ish in that case, yes
[08:55:15] <robertmaxrees> i'd slap a console.log(data); first thing in that getJson call to make sure things are looking right.
[08:55:48] <robertmaxrees> also, $("div").append(field + " "); won't do what you expect because you're enumerating over objects.  you need to grab specific properties from them instead.
[08:56:13] <jeroenem> robertmaxrees: it strange, because i even can't get the example on the docs to work :/ http://api.jquery.com/jquery.getjson/
[08:56:20] <jeroenem> i will try it with your code instead
[08:56:34] <robertmaxrees> erro...
[08:56:50] <robertmaxrees> you can't copy/paste them directly without updating the URL.
[08:58:16] <jeroenem> robertmaxrees: i know, i've tried it with my own local json file
[08:58:21] <robertmaxrees> okay.
[08:58:22] <jeroenem> im just messing up i guess
[08:58:33] <robertmaxrees> open your console and see if you're getting errors.
[08:58:36] <robertmaxrees> also check your network tab, too.
[08:58:41] <robertmaxrees> make sure things are firing correctly.
[09:00:54] <kokut> Hello, I need to pass some variables through $_POST to another PHP script and I was looking for a way of doing it with JavaScript, considering that the elements I need to get the value from are dynamically generated and retrieved with AJAX (and don't belong to a form) is there an easy way of doing it?
[09:01:25] <robertmaxrees> kokut you can post things using ajax, sure.
[09:02:44] <robertmaxrees> you can use $.ajax() or the shorthand $.post() to do it.
[09:06:56] <Tennis> if i do something with an element could that prevent CSS from applying
[09:07:17] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[09:22:29] <SmashingX2> hey robertmaxrees
[09:22:32] <SmashingX2> are you in the house?
[09:22:41] <robertmaxrees> lol i'm around, yeah.
[09:22:48] <robertmaxrees> just ask your question to the room brosef
[09:23:46] <SmashingX2> yeah I know and thanks for that but I wanted to ask you a question realed to what I was trying to solve yesterday
[09:23:55] <SmashingX2> that’s why I wanted to ask you specifically
[09:24:01] <robertmaxrees> i'm not going to remember much.
[09:24:03] <robertmaxrees> but you can try :)
[09:25:03] <SmashingX2> ok this might refresh your mind
[09:25:04] <SmashingX2> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/gc6nL03m/8/
[09:25:12] <robertmaxrees> what's your question.
[09:25:45] <SmashingX2> Your idea of making facet searches using that approach is good
[09:26:23] <SmashingX2> however I was thinking if I want to select lets say jackson AND gloria
[09:26:31] <SmashingX2> that’s when things get complicated
[09:26:58] <SmashingX2> because then I cannot make use of that filter anymore
[09:27:18] <robertmaxrees> this is when i highly suggest you immerse yourself in the docs for datatables and figure it out.
[09:27:23] <robertmaxrees> there's likely a way to do it.
[09:27:41] <robertmaxrees> the alternative way to think about it is what attribute those two share that you want to search on.
[09:28:57] <robertmaxrees> i'd start here: http://www.datatables.net/manual/api
[09:46:43] <Squarism> Is there some way to "add eventhandler" on tag i jquery. Like you would do with myJQTagRef.click(function(e) {...}) ... but as an attribute on a tag - wo first obtaining myJQTagRef
[09:46:55] <sumyunseal> does jq come w extend functionality?
[09:47:01] <sumyunseal> or require
[09:51:02] <sumyunseal> oh jq extend is something else
[09:51:08] <sumyunseal> and require doesnt have it
[09:51:14] <sumyunseal> i guess i was right
[09:51:35] <robertmaxrees> Squarism "add eventhandler"?
[09:51:52] <robertmaxrees> you can add event handlers to elements using selectors sure.
[09:52:05] <robertmaxrees> are you trying to select an element on an attribute?
[09:52:12] <sumyunseal> is js.class beter than resigs class
[09:52:45] <robertmaxrees> sumyunseal i don't like classes in JS at all :)
[09:52:56] <sumyunseal> im not u
[09:53:25] <robertmaxrees> and since js doesn't really have a good way to emulate classes, i generally avoid them.
[09:57:08] <SmashingX2> hey robertmaxrees how can I reset the result of the filter?
[09:57:28] <sumyunseal> wow base2 looks nice
[09:57:36] <SmashingX2> I mean do you know what’s the name of the function that is called when you click the x in the filter box?
[09:58:03] <robertmaxrees> SmashingX2 nope.  probably just sets the search value to '' or something.
[09:58:05] <robertmaxrees> no clue though.
[09:58:28] <SmashingX2> ok
[10:00:10] <SmashingX2> is there any checkbox list in jquery mobile?
[10:00:45] <Squarism> robertmaxrees, i wanna do somehting like <input id="bla" add-event-handler="myEventhandler">
[10:01:11] <robertmaxrees> Squarism i wouldn't suggest doing that personally.
[10:01:26] <Squarism> robertmaxrees, oh why?
[10:01:57] <robertmaxrees> munges separations of concern - you're basically replicating inline event handlers.
[10:06:42] <surf> hi guys I'm trying to use .click() and .toggle() on ie9 with no results with 1.10.1. With 1.11 it works. Any workaround to use it with 1.10? I am using a stable drupal jquery module and I can't upgrade to 1.11
[10:06:59] <robertmaxrees> can you share the code that doesn't work?
[10:08:37] <robertmaxrees> surf i ask becuase it might be the specifics of what you're doing - i had to munge in a fix for older browsers at one point in a similar instance.
[10:09:10] <SmashingX2> how can I make a checkbox do something when I unckeck the box?
[10:09:11] <surf> robertmaxrees, yes sure, the simplest: http://jsfiddle.net/avggrLax/2/
[10:09:26] <robertmaxrees> SmashingX2 bind to the change event of the box and see if $(this).prop('checked') is false.
[10:10:08] <robertmaxrees> surf i assume you mean http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/avggrLax/3/ ?
[10:10:29] <robertmaxrees> that should work without any issues.
[10:11:49] <surf> robertmaxrees, but on ie9 and 1.10.1 doesn't work
[10:12:12] <robertmaxrees> hrm.  let me test that.
[10:13:05] <SmashingX2> robertmaxrees: is it possible to add little windows to the UI with jquery, by that I mean a square with some content in it a title and a x to the corner that is used to close that window
[10:13:32] <robertmaxrees> SmashingX2 you want a modal - jqm has them built in.
[10:15:03] <robertmaxrees> surf http://jsbin.com/#/petodajubo/1/edit works fine here in actual IE9
[10:16:07] <SmashingX2> yeah they look like what Im looking for but I would like them to be static in my website no like show up when I click something
[10:16:11] <SmashingX2> or is this possible?
[10:16:37] <robertmaxrees> you want them to show up when the page loads.
[10:16:39] <robertmaxrees> google around.
[10:17:21] <SmashingX2> well I want them to be as part of my faceted search if that makes sense
[10:17:40] <SmashingX2> if for example I don’t need one filter I can just simply close it
[10:17:48] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[10:18:02] <robertmaxrees> that sounds like a really confusing UX.
[10:18:05] <SmashingX2> and then I want to scroll down through the options of the filter
[10:18:35] <SmashingX2> like a little window with options inside in which i can scroll down
[10:18:44] <robertmaxrees> yeah, that's a modal.
[10:19:07] <SmashingX2> yeah but I see that they only show up if you click a button
[10:19:14] <robertmaxrees> you can make them load on pageload.
[10:19:17] <SmashingX2> like they show up in a secondary window
[10:21:50] <robertmaxrees> no clue what you're talking about at this point.
[10:22:21] <SmashingX2> ok probably I could draw it
[10:22:35] <robertmaxrees> does a modal look like what you want?
[10:22:43] <robertmaxrees> like, what if it opened on pageload?
[10:23:15] <robertmaxrees> because the UX you're describing sounds really cluttered - like you want a modal you can drag around the page and select filters from and then close when you're done.
[10:24:22] <Squarism> robertmaxrees, so there is no way to decorate an html element with an jquery event handler all binded in the tag?
[10:29:56] <robertmaxrees> Squarism i didn't say that :)
[10:30:01] <robertmaxrees> there's a way to do it, but it's not a good idea.
[10:35:02] <robertmaxrees> what's the problem you're trying to wrangle, Squarism?
[10:35:14] <cj> is this the right place for jqueryui questions?
[10:35:18] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[10:35:43] <cj> alright.  I'm trying to use .dialog() and the element is rendering pretty weird.
[10:36:02] <cj> there's no background element
[10:36:10] <cj> or if there is, it's rendering as transparent
[10:36:29] <cj> all of the elements I put in the <div> I called .dialog() on are rendered
[10:36:53] <cj> the close button that I assumed would be an x in the top right is a button labeled "close"
[10:37:04] <robertmaxrees> do you have the jqui css included?
[10:37:14] <cj> oh, css eh? ;-)
[10:37:56] <cj> what should I use as css uri if I use this for script?
[10:37:56] <cj> <script type="text/javascript" src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jqueryui/1.11.3/jquery-ui.min.js"></script>
[10:38:05] * cj does a bit of research
[10:38:16] <robertmaxrees> https://developers.google.com/speed/libraries/devguide#jqueryui
[10:38:29] <SmashingX2> robertmaxrees: I drew it for you
[10:38:30] <SmashingX2> http://i57.tinypic.com/2dmhyee.png
[10:38:40] <cj> looks like <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jqueryui/1.11.3/themes/smoothness/jquery-ui.css" />
[10:38:41] <SmashingX2> hope that makes more sensd
[10:38:45] <robertmaxrees> cj yep.
[10:39:04] <robertmaxrees> SmashingX2 that's not a modal.  that's just a scrollable area.
[10:39:13] <robertmaxrees> don't make it something you can close.
[10:39:19] <SmashingX2> ok
[10:39:24] <SmashingX2> scrollable area
[10:39:33] <robertmaxrees> just set up a left-side rail or whatever that has all your filters in it.
[10:39:43] <cj> I'll give that a go.  I've got another question after this, since I don't seem able to change the title of the dialog once I call the .dialog() method
[10:39:43] <robertmaxrees> like ebay/amazon/every ecommerce site ever
[10:40:40] <SmashingX2> robertmaxrees: so that’s in jqm?
[10:40:49] <robertmaxrees> that's just plain html and css.
[10:40:54] <robertmaxrees> no jq needed.
[10:42:34] <robertmaxrees> SmashingX2 how much development experience do you have?
[10:42:56] <SmashingX2> ok got it
[10:45:58] <SmashingX2> but what about the title :(
[10:46:04] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[10:46:33] <tim___> Hey not sure if this is even the right place but I need some ideas on a jquery carosuel that will "zoom" or crop images. All of my image sizes are different but I want the carosuel to focus on the center of the image and clip the rest.
[10:46:48] <SmashingX2> robertmaxrees: did you see my image?
[10:46:48] <robertmaxrees> tim___ you need to look up responsive images.
[10:47:04] <robertmaxrees> SmashingX2 yeah... you'll have to write html to get what you want.
[10:47:18] <robertmaxrees> are you expecting there to be something you can copy/paste and just have work?
[10:49:08] <tim___> We have a real estate application that recieves approx 40k images in varying sizes. We need to display a porition of them inside of a carosuel and make it look nice... so I was thinking about basically cropping or zooming into the center of each image that way we can at least have some consistancy
[10:49:19] <robertmaxrees> tim___ what you're looking for kind of falls outside the realm of what carousels handle.
[10:49:30] <robertmaxrees> you'll have to handle that bit yourself.
[10:49:49] <robertmaxrees> a smarter approach would be to process that all server side.
[10:50:07] <robertmaxrees> process images as you get them.
[10:53:16] <cj> okay, it renders a bit nicer with the CSS rules.  I have about 13 rows of data that I want to allow the user to inspect using one of these dialog boxes.  When the user clicks on a link in the first <td> of a tabular rendering of the data, a dialog pops up.  After closing the dialog, the user can click the link on another row.
[10:53:52] <robertmaxrees> okay.
[10:54:25] <cj> As it currently stands, the dialog pops back up with the old title value, even though I've done a $('#dialogBox').attr('title','something new!')
[10:54:39] <robertmaxrees> becuase the dialog was already created.
[10:54:54] <robertmaxrees> oh, that's because the title attribute isn't what you want.
[10:55:01] <robertmaxrees> you need to target the header of the dialog and edit that.
[10:55:02] <cj> I'm thinking that it might be a good idea to clone a template element and call .dialog() on that rather than calling it on the element in the DOM, yes?
[10:55:09] <robertmaxrees> you could do that, too.
[10:56:29] <cj> if I do that, then I need a handle to the dialog element for each one of these rows.  maybe if I give each element a unique .attr('id',val)
[10:56:49] <robertmaxrees> use a data attribute for that instead imo.
[10:57:00] <robertmaxrees> give them all a shared class and use a data attribute to differentiate.
[10:57:32] <cj> hmmm... not familiar with the data attribute.  I'll look at some examples first.
[10:57:49] <robertmaxrees> data-anythinghere="any string here"
[10:58:01] <robertmaxrees> then you use .data() in jquery do access it - .data(anythinghere);
[11:00:14] <cj> alright, is it kosher with the html5 spec to have arbitrarily named attributes so long as they start with "data-" ?
[11:00:43] <cj> or are we just taking advantage of the flexibility of the DOMs and the fact that all known browsers react identically?
[11:01:38] <cj> looks like it's kosher: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Using_data_attributes
[11:03:07] <boshhead> As a general rule browsers ignore what they don't understand. That's a feature, or the web wouldn't be able to evolve.
[11:03:40] <cj> I don't buy that.
[11:03:58] <robertmaxrees> it's true.
[11:04:01] <robertmaxrees> but some browsers barf out.
[11:04:06] <robertmaxrees> but yes, data-* is valid.
[11:04:07] <boshhead> Well, it's true. That's why HTML5 can have elements like <article>. If a browser that didn't understand HTML5 sees <article>.. it just ignores it.
[11:04:10] <robertmaxrees> any string can come after that.
[11:04:28] <robertmaxrees> boshhead that doesn't mean you *should* use invalid tags/attributes though :)
[11:04:48] <boshhead> robertmaxrees: Well, angular seems to be doing fine using invalid tags and attributes :)
[11:04:50] <cj> I've thought of lots of ways to make use of dirty tricks like that and have avoided them because too many times I've seen such non-standard approaches fail after being in production for long periods
[11:05:00] <robertmaxrees> lots of people are ditching angular fwiw.
[11:05:06] <boshhead> robertmaxrees: for what?
[11:05:11] <robertmaxrees> react, riot, etc.
[11:05:20] <boshhead> I was hoping you'd answer ember :)
[11:05:29] <robertmaxrees> the 2.0 rewrite is going to cause headaches, and i know plenty of folks who don't like the way angular munges markup.
[11:05:35] <robertmaxrees> cj data attributes are totally legit.
[11:05:50] <robertmaxrees> jquery fills in behavior for you in older browsers, too, so you can use them.
[11:05:52] <cj> robertmaxrees: yeah, I was noticing that.  glad there's something like that to stash my crap now :-)
[11:06:05] <robertmaxrees> just don't abuse them and you're fine :)
[11:06:21] <cj> huh?  what's wrong with a multi-gigabyte DOM footprint?
[11:06:25] <robertmaxrees> hahahahahaha
[11:08:45] <MonkeyKungFu> whats the rough pain-level of migrating from yui 2.7 to jquery?
[11:09:13] <robertmaxrees> MonkeyKungFu i have no clue - i did a prototype abatement a while back to move us entiely to jq.
[11:09:15] <MonkeyKungFu> not a terribly big code-base, and mostly doing ajax stuff - not alot of ui widgets
[11:09:24] <robertmaxrees> should be relatively simple.
[11:09:55] <MonkeyKungFu> robertmaxrees ok, that's comforting.
[11:10:20] <robertmaxrees> there might be some pain points here and there, but you'll find a groove with the transition that'll make things pretty smooth.
[11:11:26] <robertmaxrees> stuff like Y.one('#secondA').on("click", interceptLink); would become just $('#secondA').on('click', interceptLink); for instance.
[11:12:39] <robertmaxrees> jquery will do a lot of things for you that YUI doesn't - it looks like YUI wants you to always reduce the set down to just a single element before doing something.  jquery often enumerates through things for you to remove that worry.
[11:12:50] <MonkeyKungFu> Yeah, looks pretty straightforward for listeners and such...  Hoping I don't run into big gotchas is all.
[11:12:57] <robertmaxrees> we often say "the each is implied"
[11:13:12] <robertmaxrees> we're here to help should you have any questions :)
[11:13:22] <robertmaxrees> and welcome to the dark side :D
[11:13:42] <MonkeyKungFu> Seems to be alot more active here than in, say, #dojo
[11:13:45] <MonkeyKungFu> thanks :)
[11:14:04] <robertmaxrees> fsho.
[11:14:18] <snover> uh, YUI was discontinued last year
[11:14:23] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[11:14:26] <robertmaxrees> some people are still on it.
[11:14:30] <robertmaxrees> just like prototype.
[11:14:35] <snover> oh, you are talking about transitioning.
[11:14:36] <snover> well,
[11:14:42] <snover> i don’t know what it matters that #jquery is more active than #dojo
[11:14:46] <snover> dojo is for application development
[11:14:46] <MonkeyKungFu> yeah, this is a 7ish year old codebase :/
[11:14:50] <snover> jquery is for dom manipulation
[11:15:11] <snover> they aren’t in the same wheelhouse, there are way more people adding animations to their pages than there are people trying to create well-structured rich apps
[11:15:22] <snover> also, wheelhouse is my word of the week
[11:15:33] <robertmaxrees> snover hahahaha
[11:26:32] <SmashingX2> robertmaxrees: is there such a thing as a filter list of checkboxes in jqm?
[11:26:34] <cj> yuck.  12 warnings from firefox for jquery-ui 1.11.3
[11:26:46] <SmashingX2> because I already look for them but I don’t find any
[11:26:50] <robertmaxrees> cj you shouldn't have any.
[11:27:03] <cj> robertmaxrees: that's what I was thinking.
[11:27:05] <robertmaxrees> SmashingX2 not sure
[11:27:21] <robertmaxrees> cj pretty common to have errors in your code that cause those.
[11:27:57] <cj> I believe that, too...
[11:39:06] <bbclover> robertmaxrees: I was wondering when you make an ajax call, in the success you get some response, and then in that success block, this refers to that response. Is there a way to pass this so that it's returned back to you or allowed to be used in the success? What I did before my ajax call was var self = this; and used that
[11:46:37] <cj> is there a way to tell the dialog not to hard-code a width?  I want it to have the appropriate width depending on the width of the contained elements...
[11:54:59] <bbclover> cj: isn't that just a css thing, width: auto;
[12:04:40] <doug16k> bbclover, yes you can return the result of the ajax request call (e.g $.ajax) which is a deferred. then the caller can get the response by calling .done(function(response) { ... do something ... })
[12:05:48] <doug16k> bbclover,  $.get('foo').done(function(response) { alert('yay!'); }).fail(function(xhr) { alert('boo!!! ' + xhr.status); })
[12:06:03] <doug16k> just return at the get and the caller can .done/.fail it
[12:06:26] <doug16k> then the code looks synchronous but is fully asynchronous
[12:06:49] <bbclover> omg I wish I understood any of that
[12:06:58] <cj> bbclover: okay, I'll throw that in there, but I am not certain why it would default to width: 300px...
[12:07:46] <bbclover> because you have 300px worth of stuff in there?
[12:08:42] <cj> http://api.jqueryui.com/dialog/#option-width
[12:08:44] <SmashingX2> how can I override the css rules that jquery css stylesheets have?
[12:08:48] <cj> no, because it defaults to 300px
[12:08:59] <SmashingX2> jquery mobile
[12:09:21] <cj> #myElementId { width: 42px !important }
[12:11:25] <cj> it looks like .dialog({ width: "auto" })  does the right thing.
[12:11:41] <SmashingX2> f*** is not doing it
[12:11:55] <SmashingX2> that element is freaking stubborn
[12:13:13] <cj> use the firefox (or chromium) dom editor
[12:13:33] <cj> make sure it works client side and then try to shoehorn it in on the server side
[12:19:45] <doug16k> SmashingX2, I suggest not fighting against jquery mobile if you can. it's a huge time sink
[12:19:52] <robertmaxrees> ^
[12:20:14] <SmashingX2> well I have to
[12:20:23] <SmashingX2> because jquery mobile css sucks
[12:21:46] <robertmaxrees> don't fight it.
[12:21:49] <robertmaxrees> theme it yourself.
[12:22:33] <bbclover> do you mean design the UI from scratch robert?
[12:23:09] <robertmaxrees> i mean apply your own themes on top of it.
[12:23:18] <robertmaxrees> and properly override styles.
[12:26:12] <kevireilly> SmashingX2: also note http://themeroller.jquerymobile.com
[12:27:17] <SmashingX2> that’s really weird. I could adjust one of the buttons to the width I wanted but when I hover over the element it streches back as it was before :(
[12:27:31] <robertmaxrees> yep - so style the hover, as well.
[12:30:45] <doug16k> SmashingX2, use comma syntax in css - dont duplicate the whole thing for :hover. example: .foo, .foo:hover { ... }
[12:30:58] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[12:31:05] <robertmaxrees> oh, that's what you mean.
[12:31:23] <doug16k> yeah adding 2 cents to what you said :)
[12:32:37] <doug16k> I've seen css files where guys copy paste the whole thing and add :hover onto the selector
[12:34:05] <SmashingX2> .checkall, label.ui-checkbox-off.ui-btn.ui-btn-up-c.ui-btn-corner-all.ui-mini.ui-btn-icon-left, .checkall:hover{
[12:34:10] <SmashingX2> is that right?
[12:34:29] <SmashingX2> I meant the last element doug16k
[12:34:40] <SmashingX2> because it didn’t work :(
[12:34:58] <robertmaxrees> have a fiddle handy?
[12:37:30] <SmashingX2> http://jsfiddle.net/kcojjz4f/
[12:38:40] <kevireilly> SmashingX2: there needs to be an element with the checkall class
[12:38:59] <kevireilly> oh forgot about the big selector in the middle ;)
[12:39:12] <SmashingX2> checkbox-mini-0?
[12:41:01] <kevireilly> SmashingX2: actually I guess I was right. You don't have an element with the class "checkall" so the hover version of that won't work
[12:41:09] <robertmaxrees> yes he does.
[12:41:28] <SmashingX2> did you see that element?
[12:41:30] <SmashingX2> checkbox-mini-0
[12:41:38] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[12:41:44] <doug16k> SmashingX2, yeah that's right
[12:41:44] <robertmaxrees> what are you asking?
[12:42:05] <SmashingX2> when I hover the element it changes its size
[12:42:23] <kevireilly> not i see it, sorry
[12:42:26] <doug16k> SmashingX2, meaning, adding that after a comma applies those css rules to hover of checkall too
[12:42:48] <SmashingX2> doug16k: so what Im doing is right?
[12:43:18] <doug16k> well, you are making a rule that applies to hovered things that have checkall class. there may be another rule overriding it though
[12:43:47] <doug16k> SmashingX2, you can use the browser to debug which class is getting applied
[12:43:53] <robertmaxrees> ^ do this.
[12:44:08] <doug16k> SmashingX2, go see if the rules you want have a strikethru through them
[12:44:52] <doug16k> SmashingX2, press F12, go to Elements, click the little magnifying glass, click the problematic element.
[12:44:54] <SmashingX2> I would do it if I knew how
[12:45:04] <robertmaxrees> SmashingX2 http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide1
[12:45:07] <robertmaxrees> you need to read this.
[12:45:27] <robertmaxrees> and go check out information on your browser's inspector
[13:01:10] <TeddyMurray> in jquery mobile, does data-transition work when you submit a form?
[13:01:25] <TeddyMurray> because normally with jquery i would do this in the javascript
[13:04:28] <xibalba> i'm trying to get the value of an input box of type email, with id email by doing $('#email').val(), however it keeps returning a blank string even when i've placed text into the input box
[13:04:47] <xibalba> im trying to figure out what i'm imssing
[13:05:26] <TeddyMurray> can you jsfiddle?
[13:05:35] <xibalba> sure thing
[13:05:40] <TeddyMurray> that looks correct what you are doing though
[13:05:49] <TeddyMurray> unless there are two #email id's, that happens
[13:05:53] <doug16k> xibalba, that should work. are you sure you didnt accidentally put #email in the html? it should be id="email"
[13:06:13] <xibalba> i'll copy it into jsfiddle hang on
[13:06:57] <xibalba> i'm a newb w/jsfiddle gonna be a few min
[13:08:32] <xibalba> http://jsfiddle.net/zL8p556r/
[13:08:44] <xibalba> i'm trying it out on my google chrome console
[13:09:06] <robertmaxrees> xibalba are you trying to do it when you type?
[13:09:26] <xibalba> well really my problem is super simple maybe i should start there
[13:09:28] <TeddyMurray> xibalba, that needs to run on a change
[13:09:35] <robertmaxrees> or on input, depending.
[13:09:45] <TeddyMurray> what you are doing now only sets the value on the initial page load
[13:09:45] <xibalba> this website we have verifies if the input box for email is valid, but it doesn't verify it's not blank
[13:09:51] <xibalba> so people can sublimt blank data
[13:10:00] <doug16k> xibalba, http://jsfiddle.net/zL8p556r/2/
[13:10:37] <doug16k> line 1 makes it wait until document ready, then run the function...
[13:10:41] <TeddyMurray> is on input better than $.change() ?
[13:10:45] <doug16k> yes
[13:10:50] <TeddyMurray> cool
[13:10:54] <doug16k> input gets any changes interactively
[13:11:03] <doug16k> even pasting with mouse, or picking an autocomplete
[13:11:18] <TeddyMurray> nice
[13:11:20] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/zL8p556r/1/
[13:11:26] <xibalba> yeah i have my post being trigger when the submit button happens, i just need to test that the email input isn't blank
[13:11:37] <doug16k> xibalba, line 2 makes it listen for any change of the email element and run the code on line 3 every time
[13:12:25] <TeddyMurray> xibalba, we probably need a better example to diagnose the problem
[13:12:31] <robertmaxrees> xibalba so you want to test if the input is empty?
[13:12:34] <doug16k> http://jsfiddle.net/zL8p556r/3/
[13:12:51] <xibalba> www.forcefieldonline.com
[13:12:56] <xibalba> click that beta button in the top right
[13:13:02] <xibalba> then click submit with blank input
[13:13:53] <robertmaxrees> yeah, do something like if ($('input').val().length) {}
[13:14:16] <robertmaxrees> or if (!$('input').val().length) { e.preventDefault(); /* yell at the user here */ }
[13:14:25] <TeddyMurray> and also check on your server side
[13:14:37] <xibalba> yeah on the server side i fixed that
[13:14:41] <xibalba> this side just isn't my fortay
[13:14:44] <TeddyMurray> cool
[13:14:55] <TeddyMurray> jquery is awesome
[13:15:06] <xibalba> yeh i'm making an effort to learn it
[13:15:13] <xibalba> just slow starting and i need to fix some small things
[13:15:36] <malavbhavsar> Hi guys, I have a question. jquery 1.9 http://jsfiddle.net/nmznfqen/  VS other versions of jquery (1.7,1.8,1.10,2.0,2.1) http://jsfiddle.net/7f6b0ptv/ Can anybody explain what's happening here? can't find anything in release notes, and this seems very imp to be left out unexplained
[13:17:37] <robertmaxrees> probably unintended side effect in 1.9?
[13:17:38] <doug16k> malavbhavsar, someone's being cute there. any property can be accessed by obj.property or obj['property']...
[13:17:45] <robertmaxrees> ^
[13:17:59] <doug16k> http://jsfiddle.net/nmznfqen/2/
[13:18:18] <robertmaxrees> though it's still broken.
[13:18:27] <xibalba> robertmaxrees, i did something like http://puu.sh/g2Jr5/552ef66b7c.png
[13:18:39] <robertmaxrees> malavbhavsar i'll guess .is() isn't looking at the right place maybe.
[13:18:50] <robertmaxrees> though disabled isn't a valid attribute of div i don't think.
[13:18:54] <malavbhavsar> I see
[13:18:56] <xibalba> drats it runs even when the email isn't blank
[13:19:10] <doug16k> it is disabled. true is correct
[13:19:19] <doug16k> you set prop disabled true
[13:19:48] <robertmaxrees> malavbhavsar compare http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/nmznfqen/4/ and http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/7f6b0ptv/1/
[13:20:15] <robertmaxrees> doug16k they were getting inconsistent results between jq versions.
[13:20:25] <TeddyMurray> does $.toggle() work differently with jquery mobile?
[13:20:26] <doug16k> ah, ok sorry I missed that
[13:20:43] <boxer-> Hello, I am not sure where to ask this but, I have a site that's using the Chosen plugin and when the user clicks on some text a list is popped up and it immediately disappears, it seems as though it is because the mouseup event is being fired on the popped up list which is then selecting the item because the list being  displayed under the mouse instead of slightly below the cursor. Is there a way to keep it from firing this first mo
[13:21:02] <doug16k> setting an invalid property would easily fall under "undefined behavior" imho
[13:21:12] <doug16k> it is allowed to explode your monitor and cause burns
[13:21:13] <robertmaxrees> doug16k yep.
[13:21:17] <robertmaxrees> xibalba kill the first preventDefault() and the return.
[13:21:30] <robertmaxrees> also, remove the space between the ! and the $ in the if.
[13:21:51] <robertmaxrees> and the rest of your code needs to be in an else.
[13:22:00] <malavbhavsar> Hmm, so this stems from me trying to upgrade jquery and running into problem with this line in backbone.stickit https://github.com/NYTimes/backbone.stickit/blob/master/backbone.stickit.js#L343
[13:22:11] <xibalba> ok i've made all those changes
[13:22:19] <malavbhavsar> robertmaxrees ^^
[13:22:21] <xibalba> it doesn't pop upt he alert
[13:22:29] <robertmaxrees> xibalba set up a fiddle.
[13:22:35] <robertmaxrees> malavbhavsar okay?
[13:22:36] <xibalba> ok
[13:22:40] <robertmaxrees> you can't use disabled on divs.
[13:22:56] <robertmaxrees> and that's a valid way to run methods on objects.  without seeing the error in action it's hard to help.
[13:24:33] <TeddyMurray> $("#home").toggle( "flow",function() { }); I'm running this but it's not doing the flow effect its doing a slide
[13:25:50] <dandaman> How do i loop through every <a> tag in $('body') ?
[13:25:56] <robertmaxrees> ew.
[13:26:00] <robertmaxrees> $('a').each();
[13:26:10] <robertmaxrees> but i would avoid it if at all possible.
[13:26:12] <dandaman> robertmaxrees: but i want to do it in a specific tag :\
[13:26:20] <dandaman> robertmaxrees: it's for mixpanel tracking :\
[13:26:27] <robertmaxrees> ...
[13:26:31] <dandaman> boss wants to track ALL the clicks
[13:26:41] <robertmaxrees> then do $('a').on();
[13:26:44] <robertmaxrees> no need for an each.
[13:26:52] <robertmaxrees> that'll already be done.
[13:26:58] <robertmaxrees> and you cna't have <a> tags outside of <body> sooo...
[13:27:10] <dandaman> robertmaxrees: i was just using body as an example
[13:27:23] <dandaman> how about all the <a> tags inside of $('#mydiv')
[13:27:34] <robertmaxrees> the same way you would with css :)
[13:27:35] <dandaman> that's more what im looking for
[13:27:48] <robertmaxrees> $('#mydiv a').  or $('#mydiv').find('a').on();
[13:27:49] <dandaman> $('#mydiv.a').each
[13:27:56] <robertmaxrees> .a would be a class.
[13:28:02] <dandaman> durr woops
[13:28:03] <dandaman> you're right
[13:28:04] <dandaman> thanks
[13:28:08] <robertmaxrees> you could also do a delegated listener on #mydiv instead.
[13:28:29] <dandaman> i wanna track specific items inside of the div
[13:28:54] <robertmaxrees> you can detect within the listener what's what and go from ther,e but whatevs.
[13:28:56] * frerich Hi - I’m experimenting with some jQuery-based AJAX communication - in particular, I’m using a calendar control (fullcalendar.io) which uses jQuery v2.1.3 and which supports fetching events to show on the calendar as JSON data via AJAX. I wrote a custom http server which serves JSON for GET requests but it doesn’t seem to work - instead, the ‘error’ callback is invoked.
[13:29:16] <robertmaxrees> frerich make sure your data is in the right format.
[13:29:30] <frerich> I suspect it did something wrong when writing my http server, but ‘curl’ suggests it works alright - I can do GET requests and get valid JSON.
[13:29:44] <robertmaxrees> frerich "valid" according to whom?
[13:29:45] <robertmaxrees> ;)\
[13:30:18] <frerich> robertmaxrees: According to the calendar control: if I paste the exact JSON returned by curl into the web page (i.e. hardcoding calendar data instead of fetching it), it works as expected.
[13:30:30] <robertmaxrees> json is not javascript fwiw.
[13:30:42] <robertmaxrees> i assume you have the datatype option set to "json" in your ajax call?
[13:31:22] <frerich> robertmaxrees: I guess so, but let me check - that’s probably somewhere within the ‘fullcalendar’ sources...
[13:31:31] <robertmaxrees> err...
[13:31:38] <robertmaxrees> you said you're using $.ajax()
[13:31:42] <robertmaxrees> share yer code.
[13:32:04] <TeddyMurray> http://jsfiddle.net/gn364dLa/ someone know why the effect turn isn't running?
[13:32:35] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/gn364dLa/1/
[13:32:43] <frerich> robertmaxrees: No, I wrote I use fullcalendar which in turn uses $.ajax() — http://fullcalendar.io/docs/event_data/events_json_feed/ is what I use
[13:32:45] <robertmaxrees> jqm 1.2.0 only works if you include migrade.
[13:32:57] <munsterberg> Just out of curiousity, would anyone recommend watching javascript essentials on lynda?
[13:32:58] <TeddyMurray> migrate?
[13:33:09] <robertmaxrees> jquery migrate - it's a plugin.
[13:33:22] <robertmaxrees> 1.2.0 uses $.browser, which was nixed in jquery 1.9
[13:33:28] <TeddyMurray> oh i see
[13:33:49] <robertmaxrees> frerich ah, sorry about that.  i'd still verify that you're getting back valid JSON from your server.
[13:33:50] <TeddyMurray> yeah -_-. apparently im using jquery 1.11.1
[13:33:58] <robertmaxrees> JSON and javascript objects are not the same thing.
[13:34:29] <robertmaxrees> TeddyMurray upgrade to a newer version of jqm in that case.
[13:34:39] <TeddyMurray> thanks robertmaxrees
[13:34:42] <robertmaxrees> fsho
[13:55:19] <TeddyMurray> robertmaxrees, http://jsfiddle.net/gn364dLa/2/ -- is this the proper setup?
[13:56:08] <robertmaxrees> you don't need migrate in there any more.
[13:56:17] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/gn364dLa/3/
[13:56:45] <TeddyMurray> im not seeing the "turn" effect, its simply sliding from the left
[13:59:09] <robertmaxrees> no clue why it's broken in the fiddle.
[13:59:23] <TeddyMurray> i think maybe because that's a jquery mobile effect? and not an easing effect for toggle?
[13:59:32] <TeddyMurray> im not sure, but i think they may be different
[13:59:39] <TeddyMurray> http://jqueryui.com/easing/
[13:59:40] <robertmaxrees> jqm adds stuff like that in for you.
[13:59:43] <TeddyMurray> hmm
[14:00:34] <robertmaxrees> might need to inut everything up front, too.
[14:00:46] <robertmaxrees> but i could be wrong.  it looks like it's trying to run it.
[14:02:30] <TeddyMurray> this is so weird
[14:02:55] <TeddyMurray> okay, if i include jquery ui
[14:03:02] <TeddyMurray> http://jqueryui.com/show/ im able to do these effects using show
[14:03:20] <TeddyMurray> that's odd, there's about three different sets of effects for jquery
[14:03:34] <robertmaxrees> yeah.
[14:04:51] <s2013> hmm im using jquery sortable ... but for some reason the connectedWith isnt working. it was working before but i moved ul inside a div. let me paste code
[14:05:21] <TeddyMurray> was the selector dependent on the parent?
[14:05:43] <s2013> https://gist.github.com/ss2k/906e83a4c0179ba90d54
[14:06:06] <TeddyMurray> there are two .card_list's
[14:06:14] <TeddyMurray> idk if that matters
[14:06:37] <robertmaxrees> also setup a fiddle.
[14:08:15] <s2013> hold on
[14:08:39] <s2013> TeddyMurray, it was fine when it was outside of the div
[14:09:03] <Kartagis> hi
[14:09:09] <TeddyMurray> hi
[14:09:32] <Kartagis> care to remind me how we check a textfield as we type?
[14:09:46] <robertmaxrees> the input event
[14:09:52] <robertmaxrees> or keydown/keyup
[14:10:30] <Kartagis> input gives me undefined is not a function
[14:10:47] <robertmaxrees> .on('input', function() {});
[14:10:54] <s2013> http://jsfiddle.net/xv3jzchj/
[14:10:54] <robertmaxrees> instead of .input();
[14:12:06] <robertmaxrees> open your console.
[14:12:09] <robertmaxrees> check for errors.
[14:12:49] <Kartagis> what is the difference between them? I thought .input() was a shortcut
[14:13:23] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[14:13:25] <robertmaxrees> doesn't exist.
[14:13:31] <s2013> any ideas?
[14:13:31] <robertmaxrees> i prefer .on() for event bindings
[14:13:40] <robertmaxrees> s2013 open your console and check for errors.
[14:13:44] <s2013> no errors
[14:13:57] <robertmaxrees> that fiddle gives me an error.
[14:14:09] <robertmaxrees> when i try to click and drag.
[14:15:01] <Kartagis> cannot read property 'msie' of undefined
[14:15:22] <s2013> what error
[14:15:24] <robertmaxrees> that was for s2013
[14:15:48] <robertmaxrees> browser is undefined in that fiddle.
[14:15:48] <s2013> i think its just jsfiddle error
[14:15:54] <s2013> i dont get errors locally
[14:16:01] <robertmaxrees> make the fiddle replicate your environment....
[14:16:14] <s2013> uh.. how do id o that
[14:16:23] <robertmaxrees> select the right version of jquery and jqui.
[14:16:28] <robertmaxrees> or roughly the same.
[14:16:43] <robertmaxrees> or share out the site if you keep struggling.
[14:17:36] <s2013> hold on
[14:17:43] <s2013> its just html/css locally, not a full site
[14:29:37] <SmashingX2> robertmaxrees: thanks guys for helping me out, I finished with I wanted to accomplish :)
[14:30:32] <SmashingX2> doug16k: thanks man
[14:31:00] <doug16k> glad to help
[14:31:23] <robertMeeting> SmashingX2 COOL.
[14:31:26] <robertMeeting> *cool
[14:33:44] <Guest40> Quick question.. I'm trying to join the Ruby on Rails IRC chat but am having trouble... Can anyone point me to the server and channel it is on?
[14:34:09] <robertMeeting> which channel?
[14:34:28] <robertMeeting> #rubyonrails might be what you want
[14:34:31] <doug16k> #RubyOnRails
[14:34:37] <Guest40> I'm not sure.. I have a data modeling question and was looking for somewhere to ask it..
[14:34:50] <robertMeeting> yeah, then /join #rubyonrails
[14:35:19] <robertMeeting> if that doesn't work you might need to register an account
[14:36:08] <Guest40> Ya i've been trying to connect to #rubyonrails but it doesn't seem to work.. Is it on another server than irs.freenode.net?
[14:36:22] <robertMeeting> no.
[14:36:27] <robertMeeting> you need to create an account
[14:36:34] <robertMeeting> with nickserv
[14:44:50] <s2013> Swappticon, you need to identify
[14:44:57] <s2013> shit it still isnt working wtf
[14:44:57] <Squarism> given a tag, how do i get its parent? .parent() doesnt seem to do it?
[14:45:10] <Squarism> im on jquery 1.11.1
[14:45:13] <s2013> try [0].parent()
[14:45:17] <robertMeeting> .parent() can do that.
[14:45:26] <robertMeeting> [0] won't work.
[14:45:27] <s2013> your tag[0].parent()
[14:45:40] <s2013> if .parent() by itself doesnt work. but what do you mean doesnt work
[14:45:43] <robertMeeting> that'll throw an error.
[14:46:02] <robertMeeting> [0] will get the raw dom node, making jquery nonfunctional.
[14:46:23] <s2013> o
[14:46:24] <s2013> right
[14:46:46] <s2013> try .first().parent() but .parent() should work
[14:47:03] <robertMeeting> .parent() will reduce to the first element in the set.

[14:47:53] <Squarism> heres my trial and error
[14:48:11] <robertMeeting> fiddle it.
[14:48:22] <robertMeeting> oh, $(this).parent().trigger('change');
[14:48:25] <Squarism> it should run in ie8 and fiddle dont hande that
[14:48:25] <robertMeeting> not this.parent()
[14:48:36] <robertMeeting> jsbin works though.
[14:48:42] <robertMeeting> but you need $(this), not this
[14:52:19] <_DB> hey dudes how do I add an option to select form?
[14:52:29] <robertMeeting> _DB append one.
[14:52:32] <_DB> I looked on google but they are using a .each to do it not sure why
[14:52:39] <s2013> http://jsbin.com/noyezowoka/1/edit?html,output
[14:52:42] <s2013> thats my thing
[14:52:47] <s2013> i cant move to another list
[14:52:53] <robertMeeting> $('select').append('<option>'); _DB
[14:52:57] <_DB> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/170986/what-is-the-best-way-to-add-options-to-a-select-from-an-array-with-jquery
[14:53:09] <_DB> thats it?
[14:53:10] <robertMeeting> s2013 why do you have 2 versions of jquery included?
[14:53:17] <s2013> ?
[14:53:31] <robertMeeting> in that bin, you have two copies of jquery loading.
[14:53:35] <robertMeeting> _DB the append, yeah.
[14:53:41] <Squarism> javascript is punishment
[14:53:46] <s2013> ok its removed
[14:53:48] <TeddyMurray> http://jsfiddle.net/7eqacejy/ is there something else I need to add to the select box for jquery mobile to parse it?
[14:53:50] <s2013> i tried adding it from jsbin
[14:53:52] <s2013> i think i added it twice
[14:53:53] <s2013> anyways
[14:54:03] <robertMeeting> which version did you keep? 1.11?
[14:54:04] <s2013> try moving the list
[14:54:10] <s2013> no 2.1
[14:54:41] <s2013> it works when i move the ul outside of the div.. but not when its inside
[14:55:21] <robertMeeting> doesn't even work for me then.
[14:56:46] <s2013> anyways any clue whats the issue
[14:57:27] <robertMeeting> i'm not even sure what you're trying to accomplish.
[14:57:50] <robertMeeting> also $(this).val = ""; isn't valid.
[14:58:16] <s2013> ignore that. hold on
[14:58:33] <s2013> move from one list to another
[14:59:53] <robertMeeting> you need to connect the ULs
[14:59:55] <robertMeeting> not the divs.
[15:00:00] <TeddyMurray> so apparently jquery mobile and jquery ui don't play well together
[15:00:17] <s2013> i am
[15:00:23] <s2013> card_list = ul
[15:00:46] <robertMeeting> aaaal.
[15:00:53] <robertMeeting> *aaah the dropzone is too small.
[15:01:11] <robertMeeting> http://jsbin.com/sevemugofa/1/edit?html,css,js,output
[15:02:38] <s2013> what do you mean too small
[15:02:43] <doug16k> danasf, and do what to each one? there may be a shortcut way to do what you want
[15:02:45] <robertMeeting> look at the bin.
[15:02:49] <s2013> and you removed the div.. like i said it works without the div
[15:03:10] <doug16k> danasf, $('a').each(function() { var a = $(this); ... })
[15:03:17] <robertMeeting> wasn't working for me at all, s2013
[15:03:28] <s2013> dont know about jsbin. it works for me locally
[15:03:44] <s2013> anyways, whats the issue with having a div is what im asking
[15:04:19] <robertMeeting> s2013 http://jsbin.com/jabebapewu/1/edit
[15:04:28] <robertMeeting> i have no idea without seeing all of your styles.
[15:04:41] <robertMeeting> it shouldn't matter at all unless you've got css that's impacting those.
[15:04:58] <robertMeeting> i'm guessing the cards float might be part of the problem, but I could be wrong.
[15:05:39] <s2013> that looks fine. what did you change
[15:05:45] <robertMeeting> css.
[15:05:50] <robertMeeting> gave the ul a min height.
[15:05:53] <s2013> the ul?
[15:05:53] <s2013> oh
[15:05:58] <s2013> intersting
[15:06:00] <s2013> interesting*
[15:06:04] <doug16k> TeddyMurray, using a library saves lots of time, as long as their default standard behavior is what you want. the further from that you go, the more the plugin/library gets in the way
[15:06:46] <TeddyMurray> it's okay, i was able to export the jqueryui effects library by itself from the builder
[15:06:52] <TeddyMurray> and now they work fine together
[15:06:59] <s2013> i wonder why the min-height
[15:07:14] <robertMeeting> s2013 because otherwise there's no dropzone available.
[15:07:15] <doug16k> I call it "plugin combat". seeing what I can do to overpower the plugin. it is not a good idea
[15:08:58] <doug16k> properly designed UI frameworks and plugins give you hook points that let you make customizations legitimately from callbacks
[15:09:34] <doug16k> example: fullCalendar's renderEvent callback
[15:09:58] <doug16k> if jquery mobile had a decent js api, they'd provide some way to customize things from code
[15:10:26] <TeddyMurray> yeah, that would be nice
[15:10:31] <robertMeeting> jqm is slowly transforming to make things better.
[15:10:35] <robertMeeting> same with jqui.
[15:11:01] <TeddyMurray> i like the markup way of adding attributes to elements
[15:11:07] <TeddyMurray> but i also like adding things programmatically
[15:12:52] <doug16k> I suppose we're all free to fork jquery ui and mobile and send them a pull request with said hook points :)
[15:15:03] <doug16k> there are two forces at play, 1) the library wants to abstract what it does, so they are free to make changes and not break everyone, and 2) they want to expose a bit so people can make good customizations
[15:15:54] <doug16k> the reality is, people depend horribly upon the exact element layout, once they hack in forced customizations
[15:19:01] <doug16k> I suppose the idea is, you freeze to some specific version of that library, then you can reverse engineer a bit and make customizations. if you later change versions, you shouldn't be surprised if your customization doesnt work
[15:24:39] <Squarism> Question... the input elemenet of the following is clicked in IE8... why is the change event bubbled up to #fsceen when cancelled in tag below it
[15:24:40] <Squarism> http://pastebin.com/UveJgLWk
[15:25:21] <robertMeeting> wat
[15:25:35] <robertmaxrees> you're not doing that right.
[15:25:49] <robertmaxrees> $('#propStop').change(function() {
[15:25:50] <doug16k> Squarism, on line 13: function(event) {
[15:25:56] <doug16k> 14*
[15:25:57] <robertmaxrees> need to pass the event object first.
[15:26:08] <doug16k> same on line 11
[15:26:13] <robertmaxrees> then do e.stopImmediatePropagation(); instead.
[15:26:19] <doug16k> that global event garbage is IE
[15:26:32] <doug16k> you may have looked at a bad/obsolete example
[15:26:39] <doug16k> never ever use w3schools.com
[15:27:20] <doug16k> jquery passes a cross-browser stable "event" object to the event callback
[15:27:33] <doug16k> it gives you the "real" one in event.originalEvent if absolutely needed
[15:27:54] <robertmaxrees> yes.
[15:27:55] <doug16k> normally you use the normalized-across-browsers properties in the main event object
[15:29:12] <robertmaxrees> a-hyup
[15:29:44] <Squarism> THANX ALOT
[15:29:50] <Squarism> GAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH
[15:29:53] <robertmaxrees> lol alot
[15:29:53] <Squarism> =D
[15:33:47] <Squarism> fucking wonderful.. 12 hours of pain resolved got its conclusion thanx to this chat
[15:34:56] <robertmaxrees> boom
[15:35:40] <teza19> Hi, I'm after some guidance for 'inline editing'. We need to be able to edit the tables on the page, and then update a database on the backend. I have found a few 'demos' online, but every time I try and download the example script, I have to subscribe and never get the link. Can anyone point me int he right direction?
[15:36:24] <robertmaxrees> teza19 which part do you need?
[15:37:07] <teza19> robertmaxrees: I've never done it 'live' before. I'm comfortable with the PHP/MySQL integration, just not the jQuery/Ajax parts
[15:37:57] <robertmaxrees> kind of depends on who/what/etc.
[15:38:11] <doug16k> teza19, you want to implement CRUD (create/read/update/delete) right?
[15:38:17] <robertmaxrees> like... it's hard to say "oh just do x".  break down the problem - get the editable portion down.
[15:38:22] <robertmaxrees> then build out the ajax stuff.
[15:38:35] <teza19> doug16k: pretty much, yes
[15:39:10] <teza19> robertmaxrees: understand, however I wasn't really asking for a spoon-fed answer. I was just wanting some 'guidance' on what to read up on to achieve my goal.
[15:39:27] <robertmaxrees> deffo - just pointing that out :)
[15:39:56] <doug16k> teza19, CRUD AJAX contenteditable would be the words you are looking for
[15:40:05] <scrandaddy> Hey guys. I'm getting a very strange problem with my script. I am trying to do a cross-origin request with $.ajax() using JSONP. This works fine on all non-IE browsers, but even IE11 is having some trouble. I do NOT get a cross-origin access denied error, the request goes through and returns JSON. However, the call I'm making is not being registered (this is an add to cart url I'm calling)
[15:40:21] <robertmaxrees> JSONP doesn't use ajax.
[15:40:26] <scrandaddy> Is there anything known that might cause this on IE?
[15:40:31] <robertmaxrees> fwiw.
[15:40:35] <robertmaxrees> JSONP circumvents ajax.
[15:40:51] <robertmaxrees> mind sharing your code?
[15:41:17] <teza19> doug16k, robertmaxrees: thanks :)
[15:41:18] <doug16k> scrandaddy, jsonp asks the server to pretty-please wrap the result in a function call with the provided name
[15:41:29] <sacho> scrandaddy, what does "is not being registered" mean? If there's a request + a response, then the problem is how your server handles the specific request.
[15:42:35] <doug16k> teza19, if your app has a lot of that, you might want to consider an MVC framework - it solves most of the problems you run into with CRUD UI very nicely
[15:42:42] <doug16k> teza19, like angularjs
[15:43:27] * sacho can't in good faith recommend a framework like angularjs if you're not comfortable with javascript
[15:43:47] <doug16k> angularjs does require a very good knowledge of js
[15:44:12] <teza19> I'm fairly new to JS. I just found a demo, I'll see if I can massage it to suit
[15:44:46] <sacho> doug16k, the majority in #angularjs will disagree with you :)
[15:45:37] <doug16k> scrandaddy, I like to put a template in the html for the row, each field has an attribute that tells it the property it binds to. then in my jq code, I detach out that row. when I populate, I store a unique id in the row container element with .data. event handlers use .closest to find that row container.
[15:45:53] <doug16k> each row is a .clone of that template row
[15:49:12] <pantsofchocolate> jquery peeps I got a quick question, im using a datepicker, how do i make the datepicker force the format so that if the user clicks out or tabs out of the field they entered manually to the format i want like, 01/01/15 when the user types it, if they tab out or click a different field it would be 01/01/2015
[15:50:09] <e21959> join #openjoke
[15:50:18] <e21959> #join
[15:51:02] <robertmaxrees> wat
[15:51:14] <robertmaxrees> pantsofchocolate try again.
[15:51:27] <robertmaxrees> you want a 4 digit year you mean?
[15:51:32] <pantsofchocolate> yea
[15:51:46] <tandroid> pantsofchocolate:  http://api.jqueryui.com/datepicker/#option-dateFormat
[15:51:49] <pantsofchocolate> but if the user types in a 2 digit year how do i force it to a 4 digit year
[15:51:50] <robertmaxrees> ^
[15:52:09] <e21959> exit
[15:52:15] <e21959> quit
[15:52:20] <robertmaxrees> e21959 you need to put a / in front of commands.
[15:52:30] <e21959> tx
[15:52:48] <e21959> i m try to search for openjoke cahnnel where i can find ?
[15:53:00] <doug16k> teza19, http://www.jstraight.com/1213/2
[15:53:05] <e21959> need Ares channel for movies
[15:53:08] <pantsofchocolate> robertmaxrees: i have that in there, but it doesnt change, even on that site haha thats what i am using to i have the datepicker thing open
[15:53:13] <robertmaxrees> e21959 search it on google.
[15:53:35] <robertmaxrees> pantsofchocolate you need to bind a change event listener to the input and go from there.
[15:53:40] <robertmaxrees> check out moment.js - that might help out.
[15:53:42] <doug16k> teza19, throw a contenteditable plugin in there, to handle create and read, and use a real array instead of that exmple array and that does it
[15:54:01] <teza19> doug16k: great, thanks for preparing that
[15:54:03] <tandroid> pantsofchocolate: there's also a refresh method for datepicker that you could use.
[15:54:20] <doug16k> teza19, example is a table but it works with arbitrary elements
[15:56:01] <doug16k> a real version would also read an optional data-formatter attribute, and lookup by that name in an object with a property per formatter. dates are the best example
[15:57:13] <doug16k> the element might have data-formatter="datetime"  and the code might have an object where it can lookup a function in a property named "datetime"
[15:57:35] <doug16k> that function would take one parameter and return the "formatted" version. a string
[15:57:47] <robertmaxrees> lol
[15:58:10] <doug16k> robertmaxrees, ?
[15:58:22] <robertmaxrees> you're just very long from today.
[15:58:25] <robertmaxrees> *form
[16:16:57] <prettiestPony11> getting inconsistent values from $(window).outerHeight(true).. saw that some bugs were closed a couple of years ago, but can't figure out a solution that works consistently right now
[16:17:19] <sacho> that's nice
[16:20:30] <teza19> doug16k: do you mind if I PM you?
[16:27:06] <LindsayMac> anyone have a fav. form validation script they wanna share with me :)
[16:27:21] <robertmaxrees> jquery validate.
[16:27:44] <LindsayMac> robertmaxrees:  this one?
[16:27:45] <LindsayMac> http://jqueryvalidation.org/
[16:27:49] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[16:27:53] <LindsayMac> theres a few with "jquery validate" in the name I have found
[16:27:56] <robertmaxrees> the api is a little clunky but it works well.
[16:28:17] <LindsayMac> robertmaxrees:  doesn't give immediate feedback though, right?
[16:28:24] <robertmaxrees> it can if you want to to.
[16:28:28] <robertmaxrees> pretty configurable.
[16:28:33] <LindsayMac> ah ok.. cool
[16:31:05] <prettiestPony11> anyone have advice on getting the correct viewport / window height from chrome? $(window).outerHeight(true) doesn't seem correct.
[16:31:13] <robertmaxrees> prettiestPony11 how so?
[16:31:25] <robertmaxrees> also: what are you looking to accomplish?
[16:31:59] <prettiestPony11> building a mobile web app and adjusting some element heights based on the total heght
[16:32:12] <prettiestPony11> seems to work fine in other browsers
[16:32:21] <robertmaxrees> you should check out using css for that instead.
[16:32:56] <prettiestPony11> it should be easy to get the height of the window whether it is js or css
[16:33:07] <robertmaxrees> css ismuch better suited to the task though, imo.
[16:37:00] <teza19> I have a jquery >> $(".tredit").click(function() << thatis used to show/hide elements when a table row class is clicked (.tredit). I want to only make the function trigger if the TD class (.tdedit) is clicked. It doesn't seem to work when i change the class name, why is this?
[16:38:06] <doug16k> teza19, do you run that before or after the td elements are created?
[16:38:14] <robertmaxrees> ^ or after you add that class?
[16:38:30] <teza19> Just creating the fiddle now, I'll show you
[16:40:35] <teza19> http://jsfiddle.net/3hg5fqfc/ << it's a bit wonky when you first load it (both elements are 'shown' because I haven't added the 'hide' CSS.. no big deal). I want it so when the "delete" link is clicked, it doesn't go into 'edit' mode
[16:41:56] <teza19> Also, the updates work fine.. Connecting to database, etc. works a treat
[16:44:44] <doug16k> teza19, it is almost meaningless with no indentation. it is all hard-coded to those two exact things
[16:45:15] <doug16k> brace-on-next-line causes typical js autoindenters to go crazy
[16:45:48] <teza19> doug16k: It's the demo snippet I have.. The indentation is shocking.
[16:46:19] <doug16k> ftfy http://jsfiddle.net/3hg5fqfc/1/
[16:47:31] <teza19> doug16k: that looks much better, thank you.
[16:48:11] <teza19> now, is there any way I can make it not jump into 'inline edit mode' when I click on the Delete 'td' ?
[16:50:38] <doug16k> yes, the delete handler should do event.stopPropagation()
[16:50:53] <doug16k> then the event won't propagate up to the row and trigger that click
[16:51:43] <doug16k> is there a delete click handle?
[16:51:45] <doug16k> I dont see it
[16:52:12] <doug16k> handler*
[16:52:49] <teza19> http://jsfiddle.net/3hg5fqfc/2/ just added one
[16:53:03] <teza19> well, what I think would be one. Sorry, it's all very new to me
[16:54:03] <doug16k> you are going to reload the page per delete? imho that is a terrible user experience circa 1995
[16:54:35] <doug16k> you should use ajax to delete, and when the server responds that the delete was successful, remove that row from the dom
[16:55:55] <teza19> doug16k: I was hoping I could do that. Agree, it's not a great experience, however I don't have much experience in Ajax
[16:56:09] <teza19> doug16k: I was hoping to use something similar to what's there for the 'edit'
[17:00:25] <teza19> Ok, I can see how it can't be too hard using the example I have there. How can I validate the response though?
[17:01:23] <doug16k> teza19, something a bit like this http://jsfiddle.net/3hg5fqfc/4/
[17:01:41] <doug16k> assuming that you add an attribute on each tr: data-itemid="..."
[17:02:21] <doug16k> it assumes that the del.php backend code will reply with a 200 status on success, and 500 or something bad for error
[17:02:35] <doug16k> there doesnt need to be any del.php content
[17:02:47] <doug16k> also, call event.preventDefault() there if using ajax
[17:03:14] <doug16k> it assumes that del.php takes a parameter named "id" that identifies what to delete
[17:06:04] <doug16k> oops line 8 http://jsfiddle.net/3hg5fqfc/5/
[17:06:42] <teza19> Great, thanks for that! Good start
[17:06:58] <doug16k> it wont run on jsfiddle obviously - nobody is handling del.php in the jsfiddle shell domain
[17:07:22] <teza19> Of course. The fact that I'm taking in the response and then executing based on that is neat
[17:08:10] <doug16k> added preventDefault http://jsfiddle.net/3hg5fqfc/6/ to prevent navigating away from the page. the href on that a element should probably be #
[17:11:26] <doug16k> your code attaches n separate handlers for n separate delete buttons... it is more optimal to attach one handler that is an ancestor of all of those delete buttons, and use event delegation: http://jsfiddle.net/3hg5fqfc/7/
[17:11:36] <doug16k> as an added bonus, it works even if you attach it before you create the table
[17:13:08] <doug16k> teza19, ^
[17:14:34] <robertmaxrees> i usually suggest that people bind lower than document, but yeah event delegation is awsome.
[17:14:36] <robertmaxrees> *awesome.
[17:16:24] <rbo> yo
[17:16:50] <doug16k> teza19,  yeah binding at document is a bit more expensive. you can increase the optimization by binding to a closer common parent, such as at the <table>, replacing $(document) with $('table')
[17:17:48] <rbo> Anyone have a good jQuery for intermediate to advanced books?
[17:17:57] <rbo> to recommend* whoops, sorry about the type.
[17:18:02] <doug16k> click isn't bad - they don't happen a lot. binding a mousemove or other spammy event at document is not good
[17:18:26] <robertmaxrees> rbo the learning center has some good material.
[17:19:03] <rbo> Thanks ;)
[17:19:26] <robertmaxrees> otherwise i'd focus more on learning advanced JS concepts.
[17:20:32] <rbo> Yeah I'm also trying to learn basic design patterns... I just need to get more experience under my belt.
[17:45:43] <doug16k> rbo, http://learn.jquery.com/
[17:45:56] <LindsayMac> robertmaxrees:  sorry I JUST saw your response.. just looking for some real-time validation for basic text fields.. mostly just to remind people a field is required and to make sure no strange characters rre input. I'm doing stuff serverside but like client side calidation too. I usually just use a random one I found a while back but figured I would ask those who probably use them more than i do
[17:46:09] <LindsayMac> re: form validation
[17:46:15] <rbo> thanks
[17:49:32] <teza19> Sorry doug16k, I had to step out. Thanks for your help
[17:50:14] <teza19> doug16k: it still seems to go into 'edit' mode when I hit the delete cell
[17:51:04] <doug16k> teza19, because it stops the propagation of click, not mouseup
[17:51:14] <teza19> ahh, right
[17:52:15] <doug16k> why mouseup
[17:52:22] <doug16k> something wrong with listening for click?
[17:53:53] <teza19> doug16k: Just using the demo, that's all :)
[17:54:13] <teza19> doug16k: I'm getting an error in the console, which seems to be causing me issues: 'Uncaught TypeError: undefined is not a function'
[17:59:03] <teza19> doug16k: I'm going to set up a live demo.
[18:00:10] <doug16k> teza19, http://jsfiddle.net/3hg5fqfc/10/
[18:02:57] <teza19> unfortunately get the same error
[18:08:39] <teza19> Seems to be an issue with this line: row = elem.closest('tr'),
[18:08:56] <doug16k> it works in the fiddle
[18:09:11] <teza19> Yeah, that's what's confusing me
[18:09:20] <doug16k> that callback has a parameter named event?
[18:09:41] <doug16k> the previous line does elem = $(event.target), ?
[18:10:20] <teza19> Sorry.. this is the troublesome line: '$(document).on('click', '.delCell', function(event){'
[18:12:17] <doug16k> show more
[18:12:23] <doug16k> you are being misled by the error message
[18:12:50] <doug16k> and what is the exact error message
[18:13:07] <teza19> The line after that one has the 'elem = $...' call
[18:13:13] <doug16k> describing as "doesnt work" is like nails on a blackboard to a developer
[18:13:28] <teza19> One sec, i'll show you the exact file
[18:15:09] <doug16k> $ not being defined could be an error. $ not being jquery could cause on to be undefined, which is an error.
[18:16:17] <teza19> http://pastebin.com/N67nGWfz << that's the exact error I see in the console whenever I load the page. No matter where I click, or what I do, none of the functions work anymore
[18:16:29] <doug16k> any random syntax error below could cause it to blame that whole unterminated statement
[18:16:41] <s2013> wheres the code teza19
[18:17:02] <teza19> It's coming, it's coming.. http://pastebin.com/cKNQgQY9
[18:17:03] <doug16k> ...
[18:17:18] <doug16k> stack trace is great though - if you can see the lines of code
[18:17:41] <doug16k> WHOLE statements
[18:17:49] <doug16k> not just the first line ending with function(event) {
[18:18:25] <doug16k> that is followed by blah blah });   <-- that's the real end
[18:19:02] <teza19> Understood
[18:19:13] <teza19> I'll show you the php code as well, one moment
[18:20:07] <teza19> http://pastebin.com/PPGxMjke << php code (index.php)
[18:20:31] <doug16k> line 13, where did you get that $(this) from
[18:20:49] <doug16k> it's wrong
[18:21:03] <doug16k> replace that with row
[18:21:04] <teza19> http://jsfiddle.net/3hg5fqfc/10/ << It's in the JSFiddle
[18:21:12] <doug16k> row.remove();
[18:21:29] <doug16k> ah sorry
[18:21:47] <doug16k> http://jsfiddle.net/3hg5fqfc/11/
[18:22:00] <teza19> Unfortunately I'm still getting that error
[18:22:27] <doug16k> I'm not
[18:22:52] <doug16k> bugs that arent there are impossible to find. there must be some slight difference on your real site
[18:23:14] <teza19> Could the jquery version be causing an issue?
[18:23:24] <doug16k> you mean - when your real server succeeds the delete?
[18:23:35] <doug16k> that case can't be tested unless forced in the fiddle
[18:23:52] <teza19> doug16k: it's not even allowing me to do that. I can't make any edits, etc.
[18:24:04] <doug16k> or you mean, it can't even page load because it crashes instantly and errors in the console immediately
[18:24:28] <doug16k> is the real thing on a url I can look at on the internet
[18:25:27] <teza19> doug16k: it's not, I'll work on getting it uploaded. I just pointed to the latest JQuery library from google and that seemed to solve it
[18:25:41] <teza19> doug16k: yes, it was crashing and error-ing out immediately
[18:26:27] <doug16k> I forced it to pretend to do the ajax and instantly succeed the delete ajax http://jsfiddle.net/3hg5fqfc/12/
[18:26:28] <doug16k> works
[18:27:04] <teza19> Brilliant! Thanks for that. I'm just going to update my del.php file and see how we go
[18:30:34] <teza19> doug16k: I'm getting 'id' as undefined
[18:31:26] <teza19> What's the difference between using: $(this).attr('id'); and what you had?
[18:32:12] <robertmaxrees> variables are neat.
[18:32:17] <robertmaxrees> what line arew you getting the error on?
[18:34:03] <teza19> robertmaxrees: http://pastebin.com/yidLJsQk .. Line 5. Latest Fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/3hg5fqfc/12/
[18:34:20] <robertmaxrees> that dosn't make any sense.
[18:34:23] <robertmaxrees> you're declaring the var there.
[18:35:04] <snover> i love things that don’t make any sense
[18:35:07] <robertmaxrees> also, event.stopImmediatePropagation(); does  event.preventDefault(); and event.stopPropagation(); for you, so ditch the line after it.
[18:35:32] <snover> that’s not what stopImmediatePropagation does
[18:35:44] <robertmaxrees> i was under the impression that's what it does.
[18:36:13] <snover> stopImmediatePropagation prevents the event from bubbling to the parent node, and also prevents any future event listeners registered on the current node from being called
[18:36:18] <snover> it does not prevent the default action
[18:36:50] <snover> the only difference between stopImmediatePropagation and stopPropagation is that the former one also stops event listeners registered later on the current node
[18:37:40] <robertmaxrees> woah.  i wonder why i had that mixed up.
[18:38:05] <robertmaxrees> thank you for setting me straight.
[18:40:40] <doug16k> the immediate part means, dont even try to run more delegated handlers in the loop of registered callbacks
[18:40:43] <teza19> The following JQuery snippet doesn't seem to be 'posting' the ID to del.php --> http://pastebin.com/DE7tbsd6
[18:40:49] <doug16k> it relies on being registered before that other one
[18:40:57] <robertmaxrees> yeah i get that now.
[18:41:17] <teza19> oops, that's an old snippet.. the 'if" statement in del.php has '$_POST['id']' in there
[18:41:19] <doug16k> ya I figured - might help any lurkers know why
[18:41:36] <doug16k> ...why immediate
[18:44:09] <teza19> Got it.. Thanks all. JQuery / Ajax is real cool :)
[18:45:11] <doug16k> teza19, yeah, ajax is actually significantly easier than forcing a page reload every time - no need to reconstruct state
[18:46:36] <Side_FX> Does anyone know where to get a simple multilevel dropdown menu?
[18:47:04] <blackhajime> Anyone using knockout and bootstrap form validator .?
[18:47:12] <teza19> doug16k: it's fantastic! I just have one more issue (i really should upload this).. The new JQuery works a treat for deleting, but not editing anymore.
[18:48:03] <doug16k> which part? clicking an editiable thing doesnt kick over to inputs?
[18:49:15] <teza19> Correct. It seems as though the "ID" is not getting defined anymore --> http://pastebin.com/yidLJsQk (Line: 24)
[18:49:48] <doug16k> it's a bad idea to even do all that stuff with ids
[18:49:56] <doug16k> you are making it a lot harder than necessary
[18:50:26] <doug16k> use class names to give elements purpose, and find them in your js by class name
[18:50:55] <doug16k> so, each row might have 4 class names. and every row has the same class names in the same columns...
[18:51:12] <doug16k> then you can find the whole "row" with .closest and use .find from there to get those children, by name
[18:51:20] <doug16k> ..class name*
[18:51:21] <teza19> doug16k: how can I give them class names? Happy to do some reading if you give me something to search on (assuming 'jquery class names' but want to be sure)
[18:51:32] <doug16k> html class names
[18:51:47] <doug16k> <input class="foo bar username">
[18:51:54] <doug16k> then in jquery, .find('.username')
[18:52:19] <teza19> oh, those kind of classes :)
[18:53:11] <doug16k> imho, you shouldnt generate html on the server either
[18:53:27] <doug16k> I would make the backend have an endpoint where I can request a json of the table content
[18:53:49] <doug16k> then in the frontend I would .detach out some template element and clone it out for each row - using named data bindings with an attribute
[18:54:06] <doug16k> then the designer can change the appearance totally and it will still work
[18:54:34] <doug16k> and the html isn't polluted with scattered bits of php
[18:54:53] <teza19> doug16k: if only I knew how to do something like that :)
[18:55:51] <doug16k> it also optimizes caching - you arent sending totally different big fat blobs of html elements every time
[18:56:12] <doug16k> you have a static page and do ajax requests which can also be made highly cacheable with etags
[18:56:56] <teza19> I'm not really a developer by trade, I just try and help out here when I can. Your ideas sound fantastic, however I'm not sure how quick I could learn all this
[18:58:02] <doug16k> yeah, not suggesting you change it all for me :)   I feel compelled to at least mention a more sophisticated way to do it
[18:58:42] <doug16k> depends on your audience too... if you are going for great mobile experience, then yes, push work onto the server
[18:58:54] <teza19> doug16k: of course, thanks for that.
[18:58:55] <doug16k> but that problem is going away anyway - phones fly now
[18:59:37] <teza19> so we have the RUD of the 'CRUD'.. Conceptually, is it a very similar approach to 'create' new entries?
[19:00:00] <doug16k> phone users would appreciate a great caching implementation to save their data plan usage too... it's a tradeoff
[19:00:23] <doug16k> yes, to create you would do a similar $.ajax, and append a new row with whatever id the create responded with
[19:00:47] <teza19> I've read that appending new rows can be tricky if there are no rows there to start with
[19:01:06] <doug16k> it is nice to reply with a json of the object that got created, in the create request. then you can blindly call your existing makeRowFromData function
[19:01:35] <doug16k> teza19, you solve that by making a "template" row, which the js rips out at startup and clones out for each new row
[19:02:48] <doug16k> then if/when the designer changes it to something that isn't a table - it doesn't matter. js works. that is what I focus on when doing frontend work - not having to touch the js if I touch the html
[19:03:10] <teza19> right, that makes complete sense
[19:04:17] <doug16k> the js usually doesn't need to know more than a couple of class names to drive arbitrary html
[19:04:49] <teza19> doug16k: so if your classes remain consistent, it shouldn't affect any frontend changes later on
[19:05:37] <doug16k> yes, by making the js have to "know" as little as possible about the html, you can make it easy to make visual changes without having to go reverse engineer a bunch of random jquery calls that you never saw before in your life
[19:07:02] <doug16k> there are millions of ways to make it work. there are thousands of ways to write it in such a way to make it maintainable
[19:09:00] <teza19> doug16k: perfect. Now, I've got to figure out how to 'add' a row (also taking into account the rows may be empty). Is there an easy way to get form elements? http://pastebin.com/vP7QTNKa
[19:11:13] <doug16k> you could put a row at the beginning of the table that is empty and hidden. at js startup, you .detach the .first 'tr' from the table body
[19:11:39] <doug16k> then when they want a new row you can .append it to the table body and set focus to the new one
[19:11:56] <doug16k> make it have a "save" button or whatever
[19:12:29] <doug16k> and update that code that exits the editing state to be aware of rows that dont have a data-itemid attribute (for example) (yet)
[19:13:46] <doug16k> and/or throw save/cancel buttons where you have that delete button in the "new row" template
[19:14:18] <doug16k> change what things look like by adding removing class names
[19:15:08] <doug16k> for example, there could be a pair of classes .newitem .item   once you have those you can use descendent selectors to, for example, hide the save/cancel element that is a child of a tr.item but not one that is a child of tr.newitem
[19:15:54] <doug16k> .item .savecancel { display: none; }   and have class="savecancel" on the container of the save/cancel buttons
[19:16:15] <doug16k> then the css just magically makes only legit controls appear
[19:16:22] <doug16k> the js doesnt need to care
[19:16:37] <doug16k> all it does is "help" you do that css by putting meaningful classes on things
[19:17:16] <teza19> This all seems so hard. I just managed to extract the cell values from my 'add' form lol
[19:18:43] <enigmabomb> whoa
[19:18:50] <enigmabomb> doug16k you just blew my mind
[19:26:09] <teza19> http://jsfiddle.net/6qgguwcL/ this is what I currently have. It adds the row on top of, and underneath the existing row,
[19:26:18] <teza19> It doesn't work in the fiddle, for some reason
[19:26:38] <teza19> http://jsfiddle.net/6qgguwcL/1/ << didn't add jquery library
[19:30:20] <doug16k> teza19, that code is a lot better
[19:30:38] <teza19> doug16k: thanks, really worked on referencing classes this time
[19:30:57] <doug16k> values.start_ip is the same as values['start_ip']
[19:31:06] <doug16k> that's php thinking leaking into your js :)
[19:31:27] <doug16k> values['start_ip'] does work in js though
[19:31:28] <teza19> Cool, I'll change that up!
[19:31:56] <doug16k> if you knew the property by name then values[prop] is totally legit
[19:32:11] <doug16k> where prop might hypothetically be "start_ip" for example
[19:32:13] <enigmabomb> Lurking here tonight is paying dividends for me
[19:32:30] <teza19> Right, that makes sense
[19:32:51] <teza19> enigmabomb: yeah, you and me both :)
[19:33:05] <teza19> doug16k: so, why is it adding the row to the TOP and BOTTOM?
[19:41:53] <doug16k> because of invalid html
[19:42:01] <doug16k> you have some stuff that is a descendent of table
[19:42:03] <doug16k> then a tbody
[19:42:20] <doug16k> to make sense of it the browser made it have 2 tbody's
[19:43:27] <doug16k> wrap <thead> around those http://jsfiddle.net/6qgguwcL/2/
[19:44:22] <doug16k> "works" is totally totally meaningless evidence of the correctness of your html
[19:44:41] <doug16k> your html can be total total crap, and the browser might figure out what you meant quite well and work fine
[19:45:21] <doug16k> if you have totally "impossible" or extremely mysterious problems, they are probably bad html
[19:48:09] <teza19> ok great. thanks.. Ill have a play around
[19:49:38] <doug16k> not that the html was really bad - it was just silently wrapping the first tr elements in its own thead...
[19:49:45] <doug16k> then that appendTo matched 2 tbody elements
[19:49:54] <doug16k> in its own tbody I mean
[19:56:25] <doug16k> invalid html can cause it to make little repairs to the structure, which can affect the operation of the js. that was one of those cases
[20:03:46] <teza19> doug16k: I've changed it up a bit.. I found a neat way to do it, and have used the cod eyou have provided to clean it up. I'll show you once I've massaged it
[20:22:06] <teza19> still seems to add multiple instances of that row
[20:41:20] <ifndefx> hi does anyone know of a jquery plugin for a simple text editor that is responsive (works mobile and computer)?
[20:41:55] <KDDLB> ifndefx, https://github.com/suyati/line-control ?
[20:43:02] <ifndefx> Thanks KDDLB, do you know if there is a demo available ?

[20:44:24] <ifndefx> awesome thanks KDDLB that does the trick
[21:09:59] <usingSystem> Hey KDDLB, have you had experience with line-control ?
[21:10:05] <KDDLB> nope
[21:10:12] <usingSystem> oh bugger.
[21:10:13] <KDDLB> I just googled it
[21:10:30] <KDDLB> well that was uncalled for :v
[21:10:46] <usingSystem> Ahh right, what did you google ? I was getting old pages from 2011
[21:11:01] <usingSystem> what was uncalled for ?
[21:11:26] <KDDLB> nevermind
[21:11:31] <KDDLB> I googled "jquery rich text editor  responsive"
[21:12:17] <usingSystem> hmm odd I didn't get this in the search results.
[21:12:41] <usingSystem> You wouldn't happen to have experience with Font-Awesome by any chance would you ?
[21:12:55] <KDDLB> I do
[21:13:14] <ifndefx> its basically font files right ?
[21:13:25] <KDDLB> yup
[21:15:24] <ifndefx> Its saying that I have to just use the <i> tag, but can't see any references to the font files
[21:16:07] <KDDLB> they're in the CSS files
[21:16:19] <KDDLB> that you <link> to
[21:16:40] <ifndefx> I'd need to give it a file location for the font files yeah ?
[21:17:50] <KDDLB> you might want to read this http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/get-started/
[21:20:47] <ifndefx> ok perfect, I went to the example section instead of teh getting started.
[21:20:51] <ifndefx> thanks it all works.
[21:21:03] <KDDLB> np

[22:28:51] <danskubr2> on this page, any idea why i can only load one iframe, and the rest doesnt work?http://danielandrade.net/ignite/
[22:30:56] <danskubr2> sorry, this page http://danielandrade.net/ignite/temp/
[22:39:40] <doug16k> only one iframe exists, is that the problem?
[22:41:51] <doug16k> why iframes
[22:42:15] <doug16k> i-cant-figure-out-how-to-do-it-right-frames :D
[22:42:54] <danskubr2> i need to add 3 different pages
[22:42:58] <danskubr2> depending on the button pressed
[22:43:14] <danskubr2> how can i do that?
[22:43:26] <doug16k> that can be done by simply hiding/showing appropriate container elements
[22:43:50] <danskubr2> setting the attr?
[22:43:57] <doug16k> you can retrieve fragments of pages with .load
[22:44:10] <danskubr2> the entire page?
[22:44:20] <danskubr2> here is where im working: http://danielandrade.net/ignite/temp/
[22:44:34] <doug16k> the iframe isnt the entire page
[22:44:52] <danskubr2> i need to load under the header
[22:45:30] <doug16k> http://api.jquery.com/load/
[22:50:34] <danskubr2> thanks ill take a look
[22:51:42] <danskubr2> so, load and no iframe?!
[22:53:27] <doug16k> danskubr2, I strongly recommend avoiding iframes unless they are absolutely necessary. they are extremely expensive in terms of resources and time
[22:53:37] <danskubr2> i know
[22:53:46] <doug16k> compared to if you simply append some dom elements to the outer page
[22:53:49] <danskubr2> i need to add a page that i dont have access
[22:54:12] <doug16k> not in the same domain?
[22:54:29] <danskubr2> nope
[22:54:41] <doug16k> do you have any control over that other server?
[22:55:07] <doug16k> it can return headers that allow the client to do a cross domain request from a specific domain
[22:55:24] <apb1963>  Has anyone used this table plugin?  http://www.jtable.org/GettingStarted#Introduction  It seems really simple, but I can't get it to work to save my life
[22:55:29] <danskubr2> i dont have any access
[22:55:34] <danskubr2> but want to display the data
[22:55:57] <doug16k> danskubr2, add a way to ask your server to retrieve the data (aka proxying)
[22:56:10] <doug16k> only clients have a problem accessing cross domain resources
[22:56:19] <danskubr2> isnt that more complex then working with iframe
[22:56:26] <danskubr2> the iframe method is working,
[22:56:33] <doug16k> you dont really want their whole page there do you?
[22:56:36] <danskubr2> i just need to find a way to manage 3 iframes
[22:56:37] <doug16k> just send the user there
[22:56:41] <danskubr2> i want
[23:04:49] <Tsulong> Heya! I'm a noobie, but i'm running into something i'm not sure where to go from here, i'm using .wrap, i need to put each item of the object into a <option></option> tag.. here's what i've got so far..
[23:04:53] <Tsulong> http://jsfiddle.net/zdrgss9m/12/
[23:05:15] <Tsulong> Trying to figure out, i can get it so it's not nesting them, and doing each one individually >.<
[23:14:50] <doug16k> danskubr2, manage how
[23:14:58] <danskubr2> yup, i did
[23:14:59] <danskubr2> thank you!
[23:15:16] <danskubr2> i put the url's in vars, then i loaded the url inside the src with jquery :)
[23:15:46] <doug16k> nice
[23:16:03] <danskubr2> thanks for te help!
[23:18:15] <doug16k> np
