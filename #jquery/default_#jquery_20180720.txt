[01:00:13] <jak2020> hi all
[01:00:26] <jak2020> how to add an character 13 to the end of a String?
[01:00:36] <jak2020> mystr="i want sleep";
[08:47:53] <spinningCat> hey
[08:48:12] <spinningCat> if you migrate your script from jquery 1.0.6 to 3.1.2 or something
[08:48:25] <spinningCat> web page will load fast?
[08:50:25] <spinningCat> jquery 3.3.1 is stable?
[08:51:47] <Woet> spinningCat: perhaps you should learn some more about JS/jQuery before blindly upgrading?
[08:52:20] <spinningCat> Woet,  i dont have much time to investigate everything
[08:52:25] <Woet> spinningCat: then hire someone.
[08:52:36] <spinningCat> oh dude
[08:52:41] <spinningCat> not again go away
[08:52:58] <Woet> hellyeah: we're here to help people learn, not do their job for them for free.
[08:53:18] <hellyeah> Woet,  are you reading my sentence
[08:53:24] <hellyeah> i have an experience with you
[08:53:30] <hellyeah> pls go away
[08:53:42] <Woet> hellyeah: "jquery 3.3.1 is stable?" - first result on Google
[08:53:52] <Woet> hellyeah: "if you migrate your script from jquery 1.0.6 to 3.1.2 or something web page will load fast?" - get familiar with the basics of web development
[08:54:44] <hellyeah> are you ignorant?
[08:55:38] <Woet> hellyeah: nope, thanks for asking.
[08:56:09] <hellyeah> what part of thing you dont understand?
[08:56:20] <Woet> hellyeah: I understood everything.
[08:56:23] <hellyeah> okay
[08:56:28] <hellyeah> good
[08:56:42] <hellyeah> no first result for jquery 3.3.1 is stable
[08:57:02] <Woet> hellyeah: not a single Google result? that sounds unlikely.
[08:58:01] <Robdgreat> Woet: maybe Google doesn't work in WTFistan
[08:59:26] <Woet> Robdgreat: I'm betting on an user error instead
[09:00:06] <hellyeah> is there a way to convenience of web site according to jquery version?
[09:00:16] <hellyeah> some of jquery function might be depreceated
[09:00:30] <Woet> hellyeah: "convenience of web site according to jquery version"
[09:00:36] <Woet> hellyeah: please rephrase into actual English.
[09:00:56] <hellyeah> what part of it you didnt understand i am carious
[09:01:04] <Woet> hellyeah: curious *, and all of it.
[09:01:05] <hellyeah> i have app jquery version 1.0.6
[09:01:26] <hellyeah> i want to migrate 3.3.1 or 3.1.2
[09:01:39] <hellyeah> i just want to check depreceated methods in jquery 1.0.6
[09:01:42] <hellyeah> namely
[09:02:00] <hellyeah> method doesnt have any usage in newer version like 3.1.2 3.3.1
[09:02:05] <hellyeah> you understand now
[09:02:09] <Robdgreat> you can drop it into your dev copy and see what breaks
[09:02:48] <Woet> hellyeah: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-migrate
[09:02:54] <Woet> hellyeah: and/or what Robdgreat said
[09:03:07] <Woet> hellyeah: also, in regards to your weird Google issue, here's mine: https://s.woet.me/A3i9VGhREz.png
[09:46:27] <hellyeah> yo again
[09:46:35] <hellyeah> what version are you suggesting here?
[09:50:29] <ryan_ford> in general?
[09:59:20] <hellyeah> ryan_ford,  yea
[10:00:20] <ryan_ford> well common sense would say the newest version would be the most feature rich, but i think you lose some compatability with dirt old browsers
[10:01:13] <ryan_ford> there's a pretty obscene statistic saying like 90%+ users are still on 1.x though
[10:02:53] <ryan_ford> https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/js-jquery/all/all
[10:04:09] <ryan_ford> https://www.quora.com/Which-version-of-jQuery-should-I-use-Why
[10:13:32] <hellyeah> 1.0 cause security issue
[10:13:59] <hellyeah> my app is health care web app
[10:14:06] <hellyeah> i dont want any security isue
[10:14:18] <hellyeah> and also we dont have to support old browser
[10:16:34] <hellyeah> what you suggest 3.2.1 or 2.2.1?
[10:23:38] <ryan_ford> i think all the versions have stable releases
[10:23:56] <hellyeah> 3.x hasve 3.3.1
[10:24:11] <ryan_ford> all the major versions*, so it's not like using 1 or 2 will have gaping security holes
[10:24:19] <ryan_ford> just different features or implementations
[10:24:45] <hellyeah> what is that holes?
[10:24:49] <hellyeah> garping?
[10:25:15] <ryan_ford> I'm saying 1 or 2 are also updated
[10:25:45] <ryan_ford> but don't have all the same features or implement the features differently
[10:26:09] <ryan_ford> which is why the browser support is different
[10:26:36] <ryan_ford> if you don't need to support older browsers go with the newest version of 3
[10:26:52] <ryan_ford> but make sure any plugins you plan to use are compatable
[10:28:42] <jak2000> Hi all i display a Bootstrap dialog Modal, my question is: how to center in my cell phone? (the Dialog Form)? thanks
[10:30:55] <ryan_ford> doesn't it do that automatically?
[10:31:14] <jak2000> not
[10:32:49] <ryan_ford> https://devdocs.io/bootstrap~4/components/modal/index
[10:33:07] <ryan_ford> which version are you using and are you trying to center it vertically or horizontally
[10:33:14] <ryan_ford> either way it's pretty OT for this channel
[10:34:17] <jak2000> see i need move to left top corner: https://imgur.com/a/KZKmvpB
[10:34:42] <jak2000> i use: https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.7/js/bootstrap.min.js and: https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.7/css/bootstrap.min.css
[10:40:13] <ryan_ford> seems like it just uses the standard grid system
[10:40:30] <jak2000> ryan_ford which recommend me?
[10:40:53] <ryan_ford> my recommendation? rtfm
[10:42:00] <ryan_ford> https://devdocs.io/bootstrap~4/components/modal/index
[10:45:22] <ryan_ford> I'm like 90% sure it should horizontally center on it's own though
[10:46:08] <ryan_ford> did you set a container?

[11:40:57] <juslintek> Hi, how to add elements to var allLoadNextReview = $([]);
[11:42:03] <taplar> there's an add() method
[11:42:24] <juslintek> taplar in console.log after adding new elements I still get length: 0
[11:42:24] <taplar> But why are you putting an empty array in a jQuery object?
[11:43:04] <juslintek> <taplar>, I'm trying to create collector for the element that will be added to document and they will be added after they match latter conditions. which are passed from backend.
[11:43:23] <taplar> You could do that with just a basic array also.  and just push to it
[11:43:46] <juslintek> Then I will pas that element to event callback to disable all elements when single one is triggered and on successful ajax callback will enable them again.
[11:44:12] <taplar> http://jsfiddle.net/b2ouvf3h/1/  but this works
[11:44:54] <juslintek> talplar, but I will not be able to apply bulk attr change that way, I will have to iterrate that array, why do double itteration while jQuery handles that under the hood?
[11:45:13] <taplar> fair point.  so ^^^ you can use the add() method
[11:46:13] <juslintek> taplar, seems that something is probably wrong with my addition or condition because no elements are added, maybe I need to wrap existing jQuery element with jQuery again. :-D
[11:46:24] <taplar> nope
[11:46:36] <taplar> all you have to do is add() it, and store the result back into the variable
[11:47:28] <taplar> when you add an element to the result stack, a new jQuery object is created.  it doesn't mutate the original, so you have to store it back in the variable if you want to keep a running collection
[11:47:32] <juslintek> Found problem. I do $([]), while you do $(). :-) Thats why it doesn't work for me. :-)
[11:48:15] <taplar> http://jsfiddle.net/b2ouvf3h/3/  [] also works, but is unnecessary
[11:52:41] <juslintek> Hm, for me seems it doesn't work either way, will try doible wrap, because I do it like that:
[11:52:44] <juslintek> https://jsfiddle.net/twjpbsm8/3/
[11:53:51] <taplar> double wrapping won't do anything though.  jQuery will test the argument first to see if it is already a jQuery object and if so, will just return what you gave it
[11:54:47] <juslintek> Well you can test my, case yeah it doesn't work either for some reason. Is it because element is create in jQuery?
[11:55:24] <taplar> let me look at your fiddle again
[11:55:58] <taplar> did you see what I said about add() does not mutate the original?
[11:57:11] <juslintek> taplar, https://jsfiddle.net/twjpbsm8/5/ still the same
[11:57:34] <taplar> line 8 is still the same
[11:58:32] <juslintek> taplar, so I'm confused. Okay I changed back from $(loadNextReview), to loadNextReview, whatdo you mean by mutating the original?
[11:58:52] <taplar> var x = $();  x.add(document);
[11:59:07] <taplar> x.add() creates a new, entirely different jQuery object, than what x is.
[11:59:18] <taplar> x is not affected
[11:59:23] <juslintek> taplar, oh, so its not a reference :-)
[11:59:25] <juslintek> Got it. :-)
[11:59:37] <juslintek> I have to overwrite the existing one.
[11:59:37] <taplar> no, so you have to store the updated value, back into what you started with
[11:59:40] <taplar> bingo
[12:00:07] <juslintek> But if I pass the context will it work?
[12:00:18] <juslintek> By mutating the original?
[12:00:30] <taplar> no, changing the stack always results in a new object
[12:00:40] <juslintek> Okay, guess its immutable
[12:00:47] <taplar> only in that aspect
[12:01:17] <juslintek> taplar, thanx for clarifying that. Now I'm better in jQuery :-D
[12:01:28] <taplar> s'what we're here for, :)
[12:01:31] <juslintek> 1000 karma points for you :-)
[12:02:59] <juslintek> This will help me to avoid UI based bots on crashing server while getting random comments. Ofcourse I could set the limitations, but this would affect UX of quality users. :-)
[13:42:58] <sunrunner20|loun> any of ya'll familiar with datatables jquery plugin? (datatables.net). I'm trying to setup where I can select rows with checkboxes and have a checkbox in the header row that selects or unselects all of the rows.
[13:43:10] <robertmaxrees> what's the question?
[13:43:29] * taplar holds up a cross
[13:43:55] <sunrunner20|loun> robertmaxrees: sorry. Where do I start?
[13:44:31] <sunrunner20|loun> I created a column thats all checkboxes and a checkbox in the header. But I don't see anything in the documentation that'll let me know what rows are selected
[13:45:15] <robertmaxrees> back up - what's the desired end result?
[13:47:04] <sunrunner20|loun> a table with checkboxes on the left side that I can select from jquery and get a value from the datatable for all selected rows (so I can perform an AJAX call to manipulate backend data), and the checkbox in the header will be tristate & select/unselect all the checkboxes
[13:47:33] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:47:42] <taplar> how did you get datatables to render the checkboxes?
[13:47:45] <robertmaxrees> so you just want a "check all" checkbox?
[13:48:12] <sunrunner20|loun> robertmaxrees: thats 1/3rd the solution
[13:48:43] <sunrunner20|loun> taplar, right now its a <input type=checkbox> on the first column of every row provided to datatables
[13:49:01] <robertmaxrees> sunrunner20 right, so let's step through each individual piece :)
[13:49:09] <sunrunner20|loun> thank you robertmaxrees
[13:49:25] <taplar> is there any paging on the table?
[13:49:37] <sunrunner20|loun> no paging. Its a scrolling table
[13:50:06] <taplar> ok, so it's effectively a table cell, that you are putting a checkbox in.  datatables isn't generating that
[13:50:14] <sunrunner20|loun> correct
[13:50:27] <taplar> so datatables isn't going to be able to tell you anything about the checkbox
[13:50:35] <robertmaxrees> but jquery can.
[13:51:40] <taplar> so if this were a static table that you built, do you have an idea about how you would go about it?
[13:52:48] <sunrunner20|loun> not right now, reading up on how to access tables in jquery though
[13:53:03] <taplar> a table is a tag just like other tags
[13:53:09] <robertmaxrees> ^
[13:53:14] <taplar> any tag can have a class or an id or whatever
[13:53:25] <robertmaxrees> sunrunner20|loun have you done any basic tutorials?
[13:53:33] <sunrunner20|loun> some
[13:53:51] <sunrunner20|loun> nothing's referenced how to get a brother/sister element though
[13:54:14] <taplar> so question
[13:54:25] <taplar> your problem is "select all", right?
[13:55:17] <taplar> the 'all' being the checkboxes
[13:56:38] <sunrunner20|loun> main problem is how I get column x from table rows that have the checkbox checked. The start I think is $('tr td input :checked')
[13:56:58] <taplar> hold on hold on
[13:57:07] <taplar> lets start off super simple
[13:57:19] <taplar> why do we need to know anything about the table?
[13:57:25] <taplar> we just need to get the checkboxes, no?
[13:57:57] <sunrunner20|loun> the table contains a unique value I need to reference in later operations
[13:58:03] <sunrunner20|loun> *row
[13:58:15] <taplar> that's fine, but for now, we're concerned with getting the checkboxes
[13:58:27] <taplar> we can enlarge our problem scope as we go
[13:58:58] <robertmaxrees> ^
[13:59:32] <taplar> so is there a class on the checkboxes that identify them?
[14:00:15] <sunrunner20|loun> yes
[14:00:33] <taplar> ok, so a simple $('.theclass') will get us the checkboxes
[14:00:50] <taplar> or if you want only the checked ones, you can ad in the :checked in there, or filter that, or whatever
[14:01:10] <taplar> but, super simple, that's all you need to get the checkboxes
[14:02:32] <robertmaxrees> ^ and you don't need to filter them if you're just setting them all to checked or unchecked.
[14:03:44] <sunrunner20|loun> crap, didn't realize what time it was. Hate to do this but I have to bail for an afternoon meeting
[14:48:01] <Rush> hello
[14:48:40] <taplar> aloha
[14:55:50] <Rush> I am very new to JQ and was wondering how to fix this error message
[14:56:32] <Rush> I am trying to parse a JSON message using this command: jq -r '.[] | .items[].text[]' listMsg.txt
[14:56:46] <Rush> And getting this error: Cannot index array with string "items"
[14:57:26] <Rush> the JSON message itself is a huge block, but I could post it here if necessary
[15:00:14] <taplar> i'm not familiar with jQuery being used command line.  Are you sure that jq there is jquery?
[15:08:27] <diverdude> I want to make the following functionality: Put an image of size 1920x1200 on a website, scaled down to 640xYY where aspect ratio is maintained. A toggle button where, when clicked - the image is displayed in full size (1920x1200) but in the same frame but now with scrollbars. When button is clicked again, it goes back to scaled mode. i tried like this: https://jsfiddle.net/xwseja06/ But it changes size and there are no scrollbars
[15:09:19] <robertmaxrees> you need to apply .full to a parent element that constrains the image.
[15:10:04] <diverdude> robertmaxrees: i see. Can you show me how?
[15:10:32] <diverdude> robertmaxrees: because i dont have a parent element in this example
[15:11:35] <robertmaxrees> you'll need to make one.
[15:11:35] <robertmaxrees> :)
[15:11:42] <robertmaxrees> just wrap it around the image.
[15:14:15] <diverdude> robertmaxrees: ok but then how do i know what should be the dimensions of the parent?
[15:15:08] <robertmaxrees> could use jquery .
[15:15:11] <diverdude> robertmaxrees: see for example here: https://jsfiddle.net/4bjy5Ler/   The width is full screen when button is clicked ...but it should just be same
[15:15:14] <robertmaxrees> to get the dimensions of the image.
[15:15:31] <diverdude> robertmaxrees: i see...how do i do that?
[15:16:01] <robertmaxrees> well back up.
[15:16:10] <robertmaxrees> are you trying to build an image zoom feature?
[15:16:28] <diverdude> robertmaxrees: i guess kind of yeah
[15:17:26] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/4bjy5Ler/3/
[15:17:30] <robertmaxrees> so this is the basic gist of what you want.
[15:18:33] <diverdude> robertmaxrees: yes that is exactly what i wanted
[15:19:38] <diverdude> robertmaxrees: do you know if there are more fully fledged jquery zoom plugins out there?
[15:20:09] <robertmaxrees> yhes.
[15:20:26] <robertmaxrees> tons of 'em :) just google jquery image zoom
[15:24:29] <diverdude> robertmaxrees: nice...i actually dont have a still image...i have a stream of jpeg coming in, like a video in an img tag...do you think it will work on that?
[15:24:51] <robertmaxrees> erm.,
[15:24:53] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[15:25:42] <diverdude> robertmaxrees: the technique is called mjpeg
[15:26:46] <robertmaxrees> will the images all be the same size?
[15:26:48] <robertmaxrees> or...?
[15:26:52] <robertmaxrees> i need more deets heh
[15:30:14] <diverdude> robertmaxrees: yes...images will be exacly same except for the content
[15:30:23] <diverdude> robertmaxrees: they come from the same camera
[15:30:47] <robertmaxrees> so then it might work with a plugin.
[15:30:50] <robertmaxrees> but it might not as well.
[15:31:02] <robertmaxrees> some of them may have odd initialization requirements.
[15:36:52] <diverdude> right ok...i should try a few
[15:39:22] <robertmaxrees> ^ and if one doesn't do what you want it to, find one that does.
[15:55:53] <diverdude> robertmaxrees: this one looks really nice but its using a very old version of jquery :( http://www.elevateweb.co.uk/image-zoom/examples
[15:56:38] <robertmaxrees> have you tried it with a more recent version?
[15:57:17] <robertmaxrees> also: https://github.com/timmywil/jquery.panzoom
[16:13:02] <diverdude> robertmaxrees: seems like that plugin does not have that moving box which looks so nice like this one has http://www.elevateweb.co.uk/image-zoom/examples
[16:13:19] <robertmaxrees> "that moving box"?
[16:14:26] <robertmaxrees> you mean that shows what's being zoomed?
[16:16:59] <diverdude> robertmaxrees: yeah
[16:17:03] <robertmaxrees> ah
[16:19:45] <diverdude> robertmaxrees: do you know a modern zoom library which has box which shows what is being zoomed?
[16:20:03] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[16:52:40] <diverdude> robertmaxrees: man there is a lot of garbage libraries...difficult to find a good one
[16:52:48] <robertmaxrees> heh.
[16:53:12] <taplar> you just have to stop referencing them and they will be collected
[16:53:32] <diverdude> taplar: ?
[16:53:36] <taplar> GC joke
[16:53:46] <robertmaxrees> lol
[16:56:22] <diverdude> GC?
[16:56:40] <robertmaxrees> garbage collectionm
[16:56:40] <taplar> garbage collection
[16:56:43] <robertmaxrees> ^
[17:14:15] <taplar> mmm, well at least i enjoyed that joke heaps
[19:58:21] <jak2000> ryanneufeld = ryan_ford ?
[20:00:56] <jak2000> how to add a 13 character? at the end of a text? \n ?
[20:15:32] <how2hack> hey guys, how would i set css for every element that i store in an array using $.each (inside a $.getJSON)?
[20:18:00] <how2hack> i mean, since the elements are not thrown to the dom yet (they're stored in an array for later use), how would i set the css (background img)
[20:19:06] <how2hack> i could use an <img> but the image is part of the design, not part of the content so i really shouldn't
[20:37:10] <ryan_ford> what did you try?
[20:38:01] <ryan_ford> you could append them to a document fragment, make the change then move them, but I feel like that isn't the most efficient way to do it
[20:38:41] <pavonia> jak2000: Are you sure you don't want to add a <br/> after the corresponding element instead?
[20:39:17] <how2hack> i don't think it is either, i'm just trying to create content from json, but i'd like to also try to cache the content that's why i'm first storing each element in an array, but the problem is how do i set the css for each element?
[20:39:58] <ryan_ford> well they're just objects at the end of the day
[20:40:45] <ryan_ford> this *is* the problem fragments solve though, minimizing your touches on the DOM
[20:41:10] <how2hack> so i should not insert each one separately?
[20:41:21] <how2hack> i mean individually
[20:41:24] <ryan_ford> no
[20:41:53] <how2hack> then i've got to read about fragments, can you give me an example?
[20:42:07] <ryan_ford> https://devdocs.io/dom/documentfragment
[20:57:00] <how2hack> ok i've got the fragment and it's working, but now how do i set css inside it? targeting different elements?
[20:58:42] <how2hack> using find maybe? $(fragment).find('div') <--- like this?
[21:01:45] <how2hack> yep its working
[21:24:26] <how2hack> can jquery access css ::before and ::after?
[21:25:07] <how2hack> technically javascript
