[02:05:39] <Cork> bobdobbs: you can't insert partial elements
[02:05:55] <Cork> bobdobbs: if the html string isn't closed the browser will error correct it
[02:06:15] <Cork> bobdobbs: so widgetMarkupOne will be "<div class='footer-row-one'></div>" for example
[02:06:39] <Cork> and widgetMarkupTwo is "</div></div><div class='footer-row-two'></div>"
[02:06:43] <Cork> opps
[02:06:46] <Cork> *and widgetMarkupTwo is "<div></div><div class='footer-row-two'></div>"
[02:07:30] <Cork> also "els" isn't defined
[02:07:41] <Cork> (so it becomes global)
[02:09:15] <Cork> bobdobbs: also please make a jsfiddle with the html you're trying to work with
[02:36:42] <Al_nz1> I am using a bootstrap plugin ( https://silviomoreto.github.io/bootstrap-select/options/ ) and I have disabled tag on the select but are trying to change the value with the javascript/jquery. The displayed value changes but it looks like the value sent to server doesn't - would this be expcted behaviour?
[02:43:46] <Kartagis> Al_nz1: fiddle?
[02:47:13] <Al_nz1> Kartagis: just thinking about how to demonstrate it - the $(selector).val() is correct, but it sends the wrong value in form data
[02:47:51] <Kartagis> Al_nz1: just copy your code?
[02:47:53] <Cork> Al_nz1: just submit it to /what-ever
[02:50:32] <Al_nz1> sandby
[02:50:34] <Al_nz1> standby
[02:58:18] <Al_nz1> sometimes getting the fiddle to go is 9/10s of the battle
[02:58:19] <Al_nz1> https://jsfiddle.net/bigalnz/be5trapw/18/
[02:58:27] <Al_nz1> dunno why the dropdowns arent going
[03:02:08] <Cork> https://jsfiddle.net/be5trapw/19/ updated so the resources is actually loaded
[03:03:20] <Cork> Al_nz1: can't open the dropdowns though
[03:03:27] <Al_nz1> Cork" the drop downs still dont go?
[03:03:32] <Cork> ya
[03:03:38] <Al_nz1> idk why
[03:06:27] <Cork> hmm the css you include is scss
[03:07:07] <Al_nz1> which one
[03:07:57] <Cork> https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.7/css/less/dropdowns.less
[03:09:02] <Cork> might be a source map actually...
[03:09:21] <Cork> yup
[03:09:59] <Cork> well for some reason the .open class isn't overriding the display: none on the dropdown-menu
[03:10:13] <Cork> Al_nz1: might be better to ask in ##bootstrap
[03:14:49] <bobdobbs> Cork: oh hey! Sorry, I forgot that I asked that question earlier. I ended up solving it using wrapAll()
[03:15:12] <Cork> bobdobbs: ya, that is how i would have recommended it anyway
[03:24:11] <Al_nz1> Cork: progress : http://jsfiddle.net/bigalnz/v7naao59/64/ at least now it renders
[03:25:00] <Cork> ah, the selectpickers?
[03:25:25] <Al_nz1> yes...but not copying value
[03:25:57] <Al_nz1> ahh - i know why - standby
[03:28:49] <Al_nz1> Cork: nope out of ideas again : http://jsfiddle.net/bigalnz/v7naao59/67/
[03:28:57] <Al_nz1> the changed.bs is not even firing
[03:32:26] <Kartagis> you left out a ., Al_nz1
[03:32:47] <Kartagis> .selectpicker vs selectpicker
[03:33:25] <Al_nz1> yeah but i dont even get the running on console before that
[03:33:46] <Cork> Al_nz1: http://jsfiddle.net/v7naao59/74/
[03:34:08] <Cork> actually http://jsfiddle.net/v7naao59/75/
[03:34:19] <Cork> you missed the . in many of the class selectors
[03:35:07] <Kartagis> http://jsfiddle.net/v7naao59/71/ is working for me
[03:35:22] <Al_nz1> https://silviomoreto.github.io/bootstrap-select/options/ <-interesting they have a different changed event
[03:35:55] <Cork> Al_nz1: i checked the code for select and it fires 'change'
[03:36:03] <Cork> so i picked that
[03:36:48] <Cork> to be clear '>>.<<selectpicker.calculatedvalue' is why it didn't work before
[03:37:22] <Cork> but ya if you use selectpicker('val', value) you don't need refresh
[03:38:09] <Al_nz1> Kartagis: did you have it working with on('change' or on('changed.bs.select ?
[03:38:30] <Kartagis> change
[03:38:49] <Al_nz1> hmm, let me try this locally
[03:39:38] <Kartagis> sure, I let you
[03:40:36] <Al_nz1> Kartagis: very big of you ;-)
[03:41:33] <Kartagis> thanks
[03:50:06] <Al_nz1> so, this is what I am trying to do - a scoring matrix : http://jsfiddle.net/bigalnz/v7naao59/82/
[03:50:35] <Al_nz1> but its not reading the values out of the matrix correctly? Moderate x Moderate should = moderate
[03:52:00] <Cork> Al_nz1: any reason you don't use the ids?
[03:53:00] <Al_nz1> I could, but either way should work?
[03:53:23] <Cork> as long as the selectors matches sure
[03:53:43] <Al_nz1> so any idea why the scoring is foobar?
[03:55:46] <Cork> Al_nz1: http://jsfiddle.net/v7naao59/84/
[03:56:18] <Cork> like i said, your selectors are broken
[04:00:31] <Al_nz1> Cork: Ok, sure that seems to be working.
[04:00:42] <Al_nz1> Are you prefering id's because of the shorter name or?
[04:00:55] <Cork> no, i rarely use ids
[04:01:45] <Al_nz1> Cork: and any idea why the changed.bs.select event wouldnt fire?
[04:02:09] <Cork> cause i think the documentation is wrong
[04:02:20] <Cork> the source doesn't have a single ref to that event
[04:02:47] <Al_nz1> oh i see.
[04:04:25] <Cork> Al_nz1: if you prefer the longer format http://jsfiddle.net/v7naao59/88/
[04:04:48] <Cork> but classes like .question1 and question2 indicates they should not exist
[04:05:03] <Cork> (a question would be another matter)
[04:05:38] <Cork> classes is meant to be grouping multiple elements, not identifying individual ones
[04:07:44] <fn> hello
[04:08:00] <Al_nz1> Cork: ok - thanks
[04:10:23] <Al_nz1> Cork: I am in Chrome, but cant seem to inspect the form data....I go into Dev, Network, and click on the html file after submit, but it doesnt show form data
[04:10:37] <Al_nz1> I know its ther because its showing in the backend
[04:10:50] <Cork> you mean in the fiddle?
[04:11:20] <Al_nz1> Cork: no - the issue I have locally I have not been able to reproduce in the fiddle
[04:11:47] <Al_nz1> the issue locally is that while the value in the dropdown seems to change it doesnt seem to be the same value hitting the backend
[04:12:14] <Cork> Al_nz1: make sure the select elements has names
[04:14:56] <Cork> Al_nz1: http://jsfiddle.net/v7naao59/89/ you should see it in the network tab like here
[04:15:05] <Al_nz1> like <select class="selectpicker overallscore" id="overallscore" title="Calculated" disabled name="OverallScore">
[04:15:20] <Cork> disabled isn't ever submitted though
[04:15:41] <Al_nz1> disabled inputs arent submitted?
[04:15:45] <Cork> yup
[04:16:01] <Al_nz1> damn. well thats my problem
[04:16:05] <Cork> disabled inputs, textareas or selects aren't submitted
[04:16:36] <Cork> add a hidden field
[04:16:51] <Al_nz1> so I need a way to change the calculated value to one of High Moderate or Low, but send to the backend a value 0,1,2 ?
[04:16:51] <Cork> or, as it is calculated, just do the same calculation server side
[04:17:15] <fn> calcuate it again on server side.
[04:17:18] <Cork> ya
[04:17:18] <fn> never trust user input.
[04:17:23] <Cork> exactly
[04:17:31] <Al_nz1> hmm, i see
[04:17:43] <Cork> the user can just remove the disabled field and change it freely
[04:17:48] <Cork> *attribute*
[04:17:58] <Al_nz1> right, i know where you are coming from.
[04:18:06] <fn> or disable javascript
[04:18:16] <fn> and then there was no frontend-calculation
[04:19:46] <Al_nz1> one issue I am going to have now is that there is information on the form about the questions which determines the overall score.
[04:20:08] <Al_nz1> is there a way to make this work on the frontend for the time being?
[04:20:28] <Cork> Al_nz1: add a hidden field and set the score there
[04:20:40] <Cork> but ya, the user can manipulate this freely
[04:20:41] <Al_nz1> Cork: yeah - nice.
[04:20:53] <Al_nz1> Cork: yes I understand the vulnerability.
[04:21:02] <Cork> not really vulnerability
[04:21:08] <Al_nz1> risk then
[04:21:09] <Cork> as it is the user that has to do it
[04:21:19] <Cork> but ya, they can send in invalid or faked data
[04:23:55] <Al_nz1> yip....will put something in the backend - but the way you suggested lets the frontend work
[04:24:29] <Cork> Al_nz1: don't forget the matrix can be modified too
[04:24:54] <Cork> so if the result values matter, recalculate it again server side
[04:27:15] <Al_nz1> Cork: yeah - another good point
[04:57:21] <Al_nz1> Cork: thanks for your help before. I was stuck on that for ages
[04:57:28] <Cork> np
[04:59:27] <Al_nz1> I also am wondering, I have some code which shows some fields based on the user picking a date of birth, if that date of birth makes the person a child : like $('.form-control.dob.person').on('dp.change', function(event) { - but when the same form loads preexisting data from the database the same checks need to be run. the date picker (eonasdan date picker) doesnt have a load function by the
[04:59:27] <Al_nz1> look of it, so is there a easy way to do this?
[05:00:11] <Cork> Al_nz1: try a simple .trigger('dp.change')
[05:01:42] <Al_nz1> can you expand on that a bit?
[05:02:09] <Cork> .on('dp.change', function() {}).trigger('dp.change')
[05:02:09] <Al_nz1> another function or can you combine .on and .trigger into one line???
[05:02:21] <Cork> it triggers the function directly when you bind the event handler
[05:03:51] <Al_nz1> .on('dp.change', function() {}).trigger('dp.change') { ....existing code... ?
[05:03:57] <Cork> no
[05:04:20] <Cork> just the code you have right now with the .trigger('dp.change') tucked at the end
[05:04:57] <Al_nz1> oh ok...but how does that fire on a load?
[05:07:09] <Al_nz1> like so : https://pastebin.com/Fri5zW8t ?
[05:07:29] <Cork> YUP
[05:07:34] <Cork> opps caps :x
[05:25:05] <Al_nz1> Cork: thanks again
[05:25:09] <Al_nz1> will try it
[05:26:45] <Al_nz1> Cork: didnt work though :(
[05:27:18] <Cork> does the event handler check values from the event?
[08:38:14] <codecutter> trying to jazz up my homepage by periodcally (every day) changing the background image , it will randomly choose an image from a folder, not sure the best way to approach this
[08:42:36] <Cork> codecutter: you want this done client side?
[08:42:52] <Cork> i would just do it server side
[08:43:00] <Cork> list the files in the folder and pick one
[08:48:36] <codecutter> Cork: do place the css in the html or in a seperate css folder (server side)
[08:48:39] <codecutter> do i*
[08:49:12] <Cork> codecutter: i would prob put the css in a style tag on body or what ever
[08:49:25] <Cork> as long as it is only used at that one place
[08:49:42] <Cork> if you need to change colors or what not then i would prob use css file and classes

[09:35:53] <Cork> there are 35 hits of indexOf in jquery so minimized versions isn't much help
[09:36:29] <Cork> hmm but r.fn.init.r.fn.load is
[09:36:42] <Cork> sounds like you're not giving an string to .load somewhere
[09:37:01] <codecutter> same
[09:37:05] <Cork> $('#elm').load(15) or something like that
[09:37:21] <Cork> codecutter: what line number?
[09:37:31] <Cork> (with a none minimized stack)
[09:37:53] <codecutter> 16
[09:38:00] <Cork> 16??

[09:38:23] <Cork> thats line 9823
[09:38:36] <codecutter> i was refering to my script
[09:38:57] <Cork> so ya, the url you give to $().load isn't a string
[09:39:45] <codecutter> you mean the url to image? <img src="image/background/london-water-bridge.jpg" id="bg" alt="">
[09:39:57] <Woet> codecutter: why dont you use CSS for this?
[09:40:11] <Cork> Woet: dynamically changing background
[09:40:20] <Woet> Cork: wouldnt CSS work either way..?
[09:40:26] <codecutter> https://css-tricks.com/perfect-full-page-background-image/
[09:40:34] <codecutter> Woet ^
[09:40:46] <Woet> codecutter: yes, you linked that. why dont you use the CSS3 option?
[09:40:51] <Cork> if you by css mean background-image, ya donno
[09:41:07] <codecutter> Woet: show me
[09:41:15] <Woet> codecutter: https://css-tricks.com/perfect-full-page-background-image/#article-header-id-0
[09:41:20] <Woet> codecutter: https://css-tricks.com/examples/FullPageBackgroundImage/progressive.php
[09:41:24] <Woet> literally from the page you linked
[09:41:45] <codecutter> well, that screws up the image
[09:41:58] <codecutter> there is a reason why i'm using the jquery version
[09:42:21] <Cork> depends on the background-size setting
[09:42:24] <codecutter> Cork: where were we?
[09:42:36] <Cork> so ya, the url you give to $().load isn't a string <--
[09:42:48] <Woet> codecutter: how does it screw up the image?
[09:43:00] <Woet> works fine here
[09:43:02] <codecutter> quality isn't as good as the original
[09:43:08] <Cork> O_o
[09:43:14] <Woet> that sounds very unlikely.
[09:43:39] <Cork> the only thing i can think of is that some browser uses different scaling factors for css and img
[09:43:41] <codecutter> how do you know, it you don't have the image
[09:44:05] <Cork> codecutter: could you create a jsfiddle showing the problem instead of this round about way?
[09:44:16] <Woet> codecutter: i said it sounds very unlikely, that doesn't mean its impossible.
[09:44:46] <codecutter> jsfiddle seems to be fine https://jsfiddle.net/apprentice_/wnuu6pqm/
[09:44:59] <Woet> so what is the issue?
[09:45:13] <Woet> oh, thats your weird JS workaround still.
[09:45:26] <codecutter> my local version is giving the error (scroll up)
[09:45:50] <Woet> i dont know why you're putting <style> in the CSS panel
[09:46:24] <codecutter> style is embedded in html after the head tag
[09:47:06] <codecutter> by the way in that jsfiddle is the image covering the entire page? it doesn't appear so, right?
[09:47:16] <Cork> codecutter: that code doesn't have a call to load
[09:47:23] <Cork> so it can't be the cause of the crash
[09:48:02] <Woet> https://www.icas.com/__data/assets/image/0005/277385/frankfurt-skyline-0217.jpg doesnt work by the way
[09:48:31] <codecutter> seems to be visible from here
[09:48:40] <codecutter> Woet: can't you see the image?
[09:48:45] <Woet> nope, times out
[09:48:53] <Cork> ya, same here
[09:49:17] <codecutter> how about https://www.icas.com/__data/assets/image/0003/277383/london-water-bridge-0217.jpg
[09:49:32] <codecutter> if that works then just replace it
[09:50:03] <Woet> its the domain thats the issue.
[09:50:59] <Woet> codecutter: https://jsfiddle.net/xetmukd9/7/
[09:51:12] <Woet> so what is wrong with the image?
[09:53:56] <codecutter> thats what i had
[09:54:13] <codecutter> apparently the jquery method takes aspect ratio into consieration
[09:54:19] <codecutter> consideration*
[09:54:26] <Cork> so does css
[09:54:47] <Cork> just don't specify two axes
[09:55:01] <codecutter> Cork & Woet, 2 jquery heavyweights teaming up on me :)
[09:55:34] <Cork> codecutter: only when you state something that is wrong :)
[09:55:58] <Cork> what you said was true a few years ago, but not with modern css
[09:56:31] <codecutter> "This whole idea becomes a lot easier (from a CSS perspective) if we know if the aspect ratio of the image (inline <img> we intend to use as a background) is larger or smaller than the current aspect ratio of the browser window. If it is lower, than we can set only the width to 100% on the image and know it will fill both height and width. If it is higher, we can set only the height to 100% and know that it will fill both the height and width.
[09:56:31] <codecutter> We have access to this information through JavaScript. As usual around here, I like to lean on jQuery."
[09:56:45] <codecutter> above is out of date?
[09:56:51] <codecutter> above statement*
[09:57:15] <Woet> codecutter: can you just show a jsfiddle showing the issue you had with the CSS method?
[09:58:49] <codecutter> Woet: maybe jsfiddle screen is too small to show the difference in quality but on my screen there is a small difference in quality
[09:59:24] <Woet> maybe your screen needs cleaning
[09:59:27] <codecutter> it could be my tired eyes
[09:59:31] <codecutter> lol
[09:59:44] <codecutter> ok, then
[09:59:51] <codecutter> i'll roll with the css
[10:00:19] <codecutter> Cork seems to suggest the above quote is no longer relavent
[12:41:11] <robertmaxrees> goooood morning #jquery
[12:42:00] <Uhkis> evening
[13:11:45] <AwkwardCough> afternoon
[14:12:31] <bigredradio> What would be the proper way to select an input element by name within the "closest" form?
[14:14:22] <taplar> what's the origin?
[14:16:49] <hlve> is this not redundant?
[14:16:49] <hlve> if (search.searchResults.snippets && (search.searchResults.snippets.length > 0)) {
[14:17:05] <hlve> it seems redundant to do the .length > 0 check
[14:17:23] <shoky> hlve: doing .length on undefined would cause an error
[14:17:45] <hlve> I understand this ;o
[14:18:07] <shoky> oh, redundant to check the .length.. why is that redundant, if you need to make sure the length is positive? :p
[14:18:11] <taplar> if snippets is expected to be an array, yeah, it's kinda redundant
[14:18:42] <hlve> The > 0 is simply checking if it exists, no?
[14:18:51] <shoky> it's checking that it has more than 1 item in it..
[14:18:55] <shoky> er, more than 0
[14:18:59] <taplar> ^
[14:19:15] <taplar> which an empty array is falsey anyway
[14:19:20] <shoky> [] exists but has .length 0
[14:19:30] <taplar> wait, no
[14:19:33] <shoky> empty array is falsy?
[14:19:34] <shoky> heh
[14:19:42] <taplar> yeah, nvm.  empty array is truthy
[14:19:52] <taplar> it's falsy in groovy, :s
[14:20:03] <grapheti> everyone has more than 0 butts
[14:20:12] <shoky> dats pretty groovy
[14:20:16] <taplar> heh
[14:21:43] <bigredradio> $("#myform input[name=first_name]").val() is valid. But what if #myform needed to be $(this).closest('form')? How would you tie that together?
[14:22:00] <taplar> .find(...)
[14:22:29] <grapheti> I was hoping it would have been 20 iframes.
[14:23:57] <bigredradio> taplar, If that was for me. So go up the DOM and back down again?
[14:24:06] <taplar> yep
[14:24:18] <grapheti> dam, that sounds hawt
[14:24:56] <bigredradio> taplar, Ok. Seems like unnecessary cycles to use find when I can reference it. But if there isn't another way...
[14:25:14] <taplar> what do you mean you can reference it?
[14:26:25] <bigredradio> taplar, I know the input field by name. Just need to limit it to the "closest" form. I guess name= is the same as a find.
[14:26:42] <taplar> that's the selector
[14:27:08] <taplar> the closest('form') part just allows you perform the logic regardless of any identifier on the form
[15:45:47] <Levin^> hello
[15:45:58] <Levin^> I have this website: http://adesprint.nacaodesign.com.br/
[15:46:45] <Levin^> if you scroll a bit, you'll notice a target changing to each section of the page
[15:47:08] <Levin^> I need to add a class to the menu, to change its color when I'm at a certain section
[15:51:56] <robertmaxrees> Levin^ so what's the question?
[15:56:12] <taplar> also do you know what plugin you are using to perform the scrolling ui
[16:32:50] <taplar> crazy times
[16:33:02] <grapheti> rip Tom Petty
[16:33:29] <taplar> that, and vegas, and I didn't know the heff was dead
[16:33:43] <robertmaxrees> yeah.
[16:33:55] <robertmaxrees> crazy few days,.
[16:34:11] <grapheti> yeah, heff died a few days ago
[16:35:00] <robertmaxrees> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1o4s1KVJaVA only got three of these guys left.
[16:35:54] <Al_nz1> Morning peeps
[16:39:27] <robertmaxrees> good afternoon
[16:39:27] <taplar> dunno that i've ever heard the willburys
[16:43:20] <robertmaxrees> you've heard music from all five of them tho :)
[16:43:39] <taplar> yeah i just realized after i wiki'ed them
[16:43:50] <robertmaxrees> Roy Orbison, Jeff Lynn (dude behind ELO), George Harrison, Bob Dylan, and Tom Petty.
[16:45:59] <taplar> we need more super groups
[16:46:48] <taplar> seems like maybe only female vocalists are doing that kinda thing now
[16:47:06] <robertmaxrees> they'
[16:47:07] <Al_nz1> sorry to hear about what happened in USA guys
[16:47:24] <robertmaxrees> taplar they're out there.  just not as big as you'd think.
[16:47:51] <taplar> it actually occurred to me the other day and gave me a chuckle
[16:48:01] <robertmaxrees> thanks Al_nz1
[16:48:11] <taplar> i was listening to the radio and bieber's song was on and it just occurred to me
[16:48:23] <taplar> where are our american k-pop cross overs?
[16:48:29] <Al_nz1> and Tom Petty too - bad weekend
[16:48:29] <taplar> i think it'd be hilarious
[16:49:38] <robertmaxrees> taplar well technically....
[16:49:54] <robertmaxrees> Psy.
[16:50:05] <taplar> oooooh, fk
[16:50:10] <grapheti> Thankfully we still have him.
[16:50:47] <grapheti> White people wouldn't know how to dance at clubs.
[16:52:39] <robertmaxrees> heh
[16:57:10] <grapheti> Don't bite the hand that feeds you - http://www.cnn.com/2012/12/07/showbiz/psy-apology-irpt/index.html
[16:58:37] <taplar> *shrug* idrc.  if they music is good, i don't care abou the artist
[16:58:46] <taplar> i'll listen to michael all day
[16:58:56] <grapheti> totally agree with that
[17:00:33] <grapheti> He kills Jews, but the dude can sing the blues.
[17:00:56] <robertmaxrees> https://media.giphy.com/media/4pMX5rJ4PYAEM/200.gif
[17:01:12] <taplar> lol
[17:01:12] <grapheti> I actually laughed at work
[17:01:47] <taplar> heh, if i didn't laugh at work i'd go insane
[17:02:04] <grapheti> few things actually make me kek out loud
[17:03:05] <taplar> heh, i was driving to work on friday and the thought actually occurred to me that "i should checkout what being 'zen' means."
[17:03:48] <grapheti> it's like karma
[17:03:52] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[17:04:02] <robertmaxrees> as a zen buddhist, that's not really accurate :)
[17:04:11] <grapheti> :D
[17:04:23] <taplar> my take on it, is an acceptance of reality
[17:04:30] <taplar> things just are
[17:04:39] <robertmaxrees> sort of.
[17:05:00] <grapheti> accepting the "now"
[17:05:19] <taplar> or being the now
[17:05:27] <taplar> blah blah blah
[17:05:34] <robertmaxrees> kindasorta./
[17:05:34] <robertmaxrees> heh
[17:05:40] <grapheti> I wonder if kids with cancer believe in karma.
[17:05:49] <robertmaxrees> karma is widely misunderstood.
[17:05:55] <robertmaxrees> even buddhists argue about what karma is.
[17:06:07] <taplar> damn, i didn't mean to push the room in this depressing direction
[17:06:09] <grapheti> My Name is Earl knows
[17:06:19] <robertmaxrees> and most people don't really understand the concept to begin with.
[17:07:07] <grapheti> It's like when we have an earthquake. It's not God. It's sin.
[17:07:29] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[17:07:41] <robertmaxrees> not really how karma works.
[17:07:49] <grapheti> robertmaxrees, I hope you know I'm joking
[17:07:55] <robertmaxrees> i'd hope you are heh
[17:07:58] <grapheti> :D
[17:08:20] <taplar> would it be fair to say that trying to put labels to these things is not really zen?
[17:08:45] <robertmaxrees> kindasorta?
[17:08:51] <taplar> sort of being a way to categorize them, and in a way, mentally control them
[17:08:58] <taplar> which you have no control over
[17:09:00] <grapheti> kindasorta is even a label
[17:09:06] <grapheti> can't have ANY labels
[17:09:56] <robertmaxrees> the bigger problem in western culture is that we ascribe to a very greek kind of philosophy and worldview.  buddhsim (especially zen in my experience) uses very eastern philosophy to reason about things.
[17:10:19] <grapheti> we are all one
[17:10:37] <robertmaxrees> categorizing things is fine - that's apart of how we reason about the world.  but you need to recognize the inherent interconnectedness we share.
[17:10:45] <robertmaxrees> like if you choose to sneeze on me, i might get sick.
[17:11:01] <grapheti> this is just simply biology
[17:11:22] <robertmaxrees> right.  it's a lot less mystical than you'd think.
[17:11:26] <grapheti> of course we're connected
[17:11:26] <taplar> i believe he's referring to morals
[17:11:33] <robertmaxrees> that too :)
[17:11:54] <robertmaxrees> even just plain cause and effect.
[17:12:54] <grapheti> If I rob a bank, I'll get cancer.
[17:13:23] <robertmaxrees> lol
[17:13:29] <robertmaxrees> not necessarily :P
[17:13:39] <taplar> @ the moment i'm just trying to use it to persuade myself to stop getting angry at the things really outside my control.
[17:13:46] <taplar> small steps
[17:13:49] <grapheti> It's wrong to rob a convenient store if you're hungry and homeless!
[17:14:06] <robertmaxrees> taplar that's awesome.  and also incredibly difficult.
[17:14:26] <grapheti> taplar, there's a term for this
[17:14:42] <robertmaxrees> should feel proud.
[17:15:56] <grapheti> socioeconomic stress
[17:15:59] <grapheti> something like that
[17:16:43] <taplar> it's not really that
[17:16:49] <grapheti> oh
[17:16:51] <taplar> i'm doing pretty well for myself
[17:16:58] <taplar> but i'm passionate about my work
[17:17:08] <taplar> and when things go "wrong", i dwell on it
[17:17:13] <robertmaxrees> oiuch.
[17:17:13] <grapheti> seems like a good environment to me
[17:17:16] <robertmaxrees> *ouch
[17:17:19] <grapheti> ohhh
[17:17:27] <robertmaxrees> i know what that feels like
[17:17:34] <taplar> so it's more of a getting back to the mellow me i used to be
[17:17:53] <grapheti> yeah, I think I'm going through that right now
[17:18:14] <grapheti> I miss the mellow me
[17:18:20] * grapheti waves at the mirror
[17:19:59] <taplar> like i was thinking about some stuff that happened last week, and i started thinking about conversations that could have happened, and how i'd respond to them, and how if the other people responded would pisses me off, an considering how i'd respond to those
[17:20:06] <taplar> and i'm like, none of this is real! lol
[17:20:08] <taplar> fk
[17:20:53] <grapheti> lol
[17:21:03] <taplar> so yeah, less of that
[17:22:09] <robertmaxrees> i went through that a few years ago.
[17:22:17] <grapheti> I just think to myself. Can I rationally or level-headedly think through this?
[17:22:22] <grapheti> If no, then stop worry about it.
[17:23:04] <grapheti> I do the same logic when I'm trying to buy something. Will I spend time on this? Fuck no. *puts it back*
[17:23:25] <robertmaxrees> that's pretty hard for some folks to do.
[17:23:43] <grapheti> yeah, not easy, esp with kiddos
[17:24:52] <taplar> i gave up tv for a long time because of that
[17:25:38] <taplar> to much fun stuff to do with either.  was a time sink for both
[17:25:38] <grapheti> oh, my bad for the cussing - don't know the rules
[17:25:59] <grapheti> I wish more people would think like this - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3G9LOJZTmM
[17:28:34] <taplar> eh
[17:29:09] <taplar> i think i'd go the immortal route
[17:29:14] <grapheti> lol
[17:30:04] <grapheti> I could see taplar on his iPhone XCIX
[17:30:07] <grapheti> bored to death
[17:31:02] <taplar> nah.  you can't rule out the human experience
[17:31:09] <taplar> human interactions
[17:31:39] <grapheti> they're won't be anymore humans one day
[17:31:47] <grapheti> maybe you can make a bot
[17:31:55] <grapheti> fembot!
[17:32:31] <grapheti> there*
[17:33:11] <taplar> i'm thinking like, if you were around for a very long time, you'd have more of a drive to play a long game
[17:33:34] <taplar> you know, encouraging grass roots changes.  investing in things you cared about
[17:33:56] <grapheti> the trick is to keep your organs young!
[17:33:59] <taplar> you'd have less of a mind set of "why do this?  i'll never see the results
[17:34:00] <grapheti> Why don't you do that now?
[17:34:00] <taplar> "
[17:34:34] <taplar> i'd have to think about it
[17:34:44] <taplar> the answer to that question i mean
[17:35:45] <grapheti> you're a 1 or a 0
[17:36:34] <taplar> i disagree with your premise, :D
[17:36:39] <grapheti> :D
[17:37:31] <grapheti> There's nothing stopping you from making grass roots changes tho.
[17:37:54] <taplar> but then I have to get off my azz
[17:37:58] <taplar> connect with people
[17:38:07] <taplar> make an effort
[17:38:09] <taplar> egh
[17:38:17] <grapheti> is it worth it?
[17:38:24] <grapheti> Depends on how you feel about it.
[17:38:52] <taplar> i think i'm more of a stay out of people's way person
[17:39:12] <grapheti> Do you.
[17:39:26] <taplar> sure
[17:40:19] <taplar> growing up i was big on the idea of not telling people how they should be.  just be who you think you should be and let others see you
[17:43:31] <grapheti> of course, if you want to create grass root changes, you can, if not, all good
[17:43:41] <grapheti> just do you
[17:45:33] <taplar> only way i know to do, :D.  and even that's a work in process, lol
[17:46:18] <grapheti> yup, the struggle is indeed real - just do what you think is good
[17:46:55] <grapheti> trying to update our app with vue.js :D
[17:47:01] <taplar> sweet
[17:47:08] <grapheti> yeah, I hear great things
[17:47:23] <grapheti> we come from knockout.js
[17:47:35] <grapheti> so makes things easier
[17:47:46] <taplar> i haven't tried the routing yet, but the whole components and vuex i liked
[17:47:55] <grapheti> nice
[17:48:23] <taplar> have i ever showed you my vue stuff?
[17:48:44] <grapheti> I don't think so.
[17:49:07] <taplar> https://github.com/taplar/gulp-webpack-vue
[17:49:25] <taplar> and the site i re-wrote using it: https://github.com/taplar/taplar-hiddenworld
[17:50:08] <grapheti> oh snap
[17:50:59] <grapheti> I'll take the Spike Knuckle for 440, Trebek.
[17:51:07] <taplar> hmm?
[17:51:41] <grapheti> Hambuger Menu > Category > Weapons > Spike Knuckle
[17:51:50] <taplar> ah
[17:52:08] <grapheti> this cool tho
[17:52:28] <grapheti> I like the non-refresh the page ajax-y feel to it
[17:52:50] <taplar> yeah it's all ajax
[17:52:59] <grapheti> so awesome
[17:53:04] <grapheti> good job on this
[17:53:31] <taplar> all the menu stuff and overlay spinner stuff is the css checkbox/radio trick
[17:53:47] <grapheti> ohhh nice
[17:53:50] <taplar> so it all works the same for pc and mobile
[17:55:01] <grapheti> dam, can't get a kilt :/
[17:55:41] <taplar> ooh, though i just noticed i need to go back and remove the display none stuff
[17:55:54] <grapheti> dewet
[17:56:17] <grapheti> I need to make more projects like this.
[17:57:03] <taplar> i'm trying to get into another one, but i'm still stuck in the architect stage
[17:57:18] <grapheti> I just got this - https://github.com/Graphettion/site
[17:57:19] <grapheti> LOL
[17:58:43] <taplar> that's cool
[17:59:15] <grapheti> mainly did it for a template for CSS - https://github.com/Graphettion/site/tree/master/src/styles
[18:00:28] <grapheti> all hosted on github and the SSL is from cloudflare
[18:00:31] <grapheti> so free hosting
[18:00:38] <grapheti> just pay for the domain name
[18:01:04] <taplar> mine's through bluehost, but my new one i'm trying to do just on the github pages
[18:01:10] <grapheti> I use rollup for the scriptz
[18:01:19] <grapheti> ah, cool
[18:01:35] <grapheti> I like rollup a lot - https://github.com/Graphettion/site/blob/master/rollup.config.js
[18:01:48] <grapheti> doesn't have code splitting tho :/
[18:02:31] <taplar> i assume that compiles babel and then uglifies it?
[18:03:02] <grapheti> ye
[18:03:11] <grapheti> pretty much like webpack
[18:03:28] <grapheti> but webpack adds stuff to your js
[18:03:40] <grapheti> rollup didn't
[18:04:31] <grapheti> But I'd use rollup if you don't need code splitting and you're working on small stuff.
[18:04:37] <grapheti> Otherwise, use webpack.
[18:07:16] <taplar> i had something in there that did babel compiling before i switched it over to webpack and the vue compiling, but i took it out for that new project.
[18:07:26] <taplar> but i'm fixing to head out.  have a good evening all
[18:07:35] <grapheti> take it easy
[18:07:47] <taplar> oh yeah, pathfinder card game night
[18:08:07] <taplar> get my nerd on
[18:11:34] <gambl0re> hello?
[18:12:06] <gambl0re> where's robert? i need to ask him something
[18:12:46] <robertmaxrees> What's up?
[18:12:58] <robertmaxrees> in channel pls :)
[18:13:23] <robertmaxrees> gambl0re "hey you there? how do i add a new element after a selector?"
[18:13:43] <robertmaxrees> pretty easy.  jquery has an after method.
[18:14:02] <robertmaxrees> keep it in the channel pls :)
[18:14:34] <robertmaxrees> what's the specific issue you're having?
[18:15:59] <robertmaxrees> gambl0re really confused about why you can't just use the channel >.>
[18:18:55] <robertmaxrees> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[18:22:21] <grapheti> maybe he needs to be kicked until he types in the channel? :P
[18:22:32] <robertmaxrees> that's not gonna stop him from PMing me :|
[18:22:38] <grapheti> lol
[18:22:54] <grapheti> k-line? :D
[18:23:07] <robertmaxrees> like - it's pretty simple.  the channel is here so multiple people can chime in/take over when somebody gets busy.
[18:23:18] <robertmaxrees> plus other people get to learn in the process.
[18:23:19] <robertmaxrees> win-win.
[18:23:59] <robertmaxrees> some people think they are exempt from that tho.  never really understood why.
[18:24:47] <grapheti> selfish!
[18:31:55] <grapheti> lata homies
[18:49:50] <gambl0re> if i have a keydown event that will then insert text into the dom, how do i make it so that the text will continue to show after 3 seconds or so then be removed
[18:50:05] <gambl0re> i dont want the dynamic text to be removed as soon as the key is released
[18:51:50] <robertmaxrees> so hide something three seconds after a key is released?>
[18:54:16] <gambl0re> ya
[18:54:35] <gambl0re> it's going to hide immeditely after keyup
[18:54:49] <gambl0re> but i dont want it to hide after 3 seconds not immediately
[18:55:29] <robertmaxrees> check out how to debounce functions.
[18:55:38] <robertmaxrees> https://remysharp.com/2010/07/21/throttling-function-calls
