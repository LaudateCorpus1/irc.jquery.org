[04:00:17] <Jebbe> Hi! I'm trying to use this solution to a scroll function through a table: https://codepen.io/salman31/pen/EVQQZd . But as soon I change the height of the #contain in the CSS stops the auto scrolling work as expected. It scrolls through the whole table but it don't start over.. Thank you in advance..
[04:22:05] <Cork> Jebbe: scrollTop + 100 == scrollHeight is risky if the height becomes one px smaller or higher the function doesn't work
[04:22:17] <Cork> Jebbe: you should always use < or > in those kind of tests
[04:24:23] <Jebbe> Cork: Thanks! Will check this out :)
[06:32:54] <silv3r_m00n> hi, i am trying to attach functions to dom nodes, something like this, $(this).data('search' , function() { ........ });   is there a better way to do this. these are widgets on a page and each has several associated functions for processing
[11:38:18] <Jeeg_> Hi, I've a problem, I need to use $( document ).ready()  but in the middle of a page ...
[11:38:22] <Jeeg_> How can I do?
[11:42:29] <Cork> Jeeg_: you can use ready at the middle of a page
[11:43:12] <Cork> doing so late in a page is risky though, as the domcontactloaded event might be fired before that function binds it
[11:43:13] <Jeeg_> It doesn't work ... maybe is already called ... by the framework ... and I can't control
[11:43:36] <Cork> Jeeg_: if it was you wouldn't need it
[11:43:48] <Jeeg_> My goal is to use a button click ....
[11:43:51] <Cork> Jeeg_: could you create a jsfiddle wit the code you have problem with?
[11:44:42] <Jeeg_> I used onclick="", it fire the function but I can't get the ref of button, name or id ....
[11:44:55] <Cork> never use event attributes
[11:45:13] <Cork> that is quite likely the cause of your problems
[11:46:20] <Jeeg_> ?
[11:48:27] <Cork> Jeeg_: on*="" is strings attached to the dom that later gates evalueated by the browser and emulates old dom0 apis
[11:48:52] <Cork> it has a ton of weirdities cause of this
[11:49:12] <Jeeg_> https://jsfiddle.net/dLyfpgyp/1/
[11:49:22] <Cork> so i would strongly recommend to use event listeners instead ($('selector').on('click', func) )
[11:50:34] <Jeeg_> My idea is to hide a table column when I click a button and change the button class ... this part Is ok The problem is the event listener of button
[11:50:39] <Cork> Jeeg_: https://jsfiddle.net/dLyfpgyp/2/
[11:50:44] <Cork> cause ya the code you had was broken
[11:50:59] <Cork> as this isn't what you think it is (as it was called from event attributes)
[11:51:37] <Cork> also .name and .id isn't properties on jquery objects
[11:51:54] <Cork> (line 2 and 3)
[12:00:35] <Jeeg_> Cork: I put it inside ... but it fires an error
[12:00:36] <Jeeg_> ReferenceError: Can't find variable: $
[12:00:46] <Jeeg_> jQuery is loaded ...
[12:01:02] <Cork> Jeeg_: you prob use a site that has it removed from the $ variable
[12:01:22] <Cork> try wrapping the code in a jQuery(function($) {}); function
[12:01:39] <Cork> (wrap all of the code not the content of the event handler)
[12:04:02] <Jeeg_> ReferenceError: Can't find variable: jQuery
[12:04:17] <Cork> then you don't have jquery loaded
[12:04:24] <Cork> at least not before you try to use it
[12:05:07] <Jeeg_> I loaded query before the js and it works
[12:05:15] <Jeeg_> Thank you so much
[12:05:18] <Cork> np
[14:59:40] <dimi1947> take a look at this fiddle https://jsfiddle.net/fiddlehunt/76ybhnkx/ the user can click edit service data(servicename,price,price visibility)...what I want to achieve is get the  ID(which is a data attribute on wrapper_servp) for each service group the user edits(and not individually for each service data)...I tried to do that with the code 105-108...but open the console to see what happens
[15:06:39] <Buoy172> I have a big js file. Is it better to define 'var $window = $(window);' at the top? Or simply use $(window) everywhere?
[15:08:35] <taplar> put it in a var
[15:14:54] <taplar> dimi1947: your parent element does not appear to have that data field on it
[15:15:23] <taplar> the first is 21, the second is 25, the others do not have one
[15:18:17] <dimi1947> taplar:I forgot to put it in the 3rd element
[15:18:33] <dimi1947> that is besides the point though
[15:20:43] <taplar> so what's the question then?
[15:22:47] <dimi1947> get the data ID of the respective service group....when I edit a soecific detail of it....the way I do it now it creates duplicates entries
[15:22:54] <dimi1947> 105-108
[15:22:58] <dimi1947> lines
[15:24:05] <taplar> it's finding all 4 inputs on that row
[15:24:50] <taplar> the two text and the two radios
[15:27:26] <dimi1947> the selector in line 105 finds all the inputs that their name attr has form in it....and the name attributes takes this values when their edited...try editing service name and prise and click save to see what happens
[15:27:34] <dimi1947> open the console
[15:27:45] <taplar> i know, i'm telling you why it's putting 4 undefined in there
[15:28:16] <taplar> it's finding the 2 text fields, and the two radios, all of which have an undefined data attribute on their shared parent
[15:29:06] <dimi1947> can you see that the array has duplicate values?
[15:29:24] <taplar> i see 4 undefined values
[15:29:42] <taplar> (4) [undefined, undefined, undefined, undefined]
[15:29:50] <taplar> is what prints for me
[15:31:35] <dimi1947> click edit button and change the value in hair and the price right to it....and tell me what you see in the console
[15:32:09] <taplar> (2) [21, 21]
[15:32:43] <taplar> because $('.wrapper_servp input[name*="form"]' returned the services and price inputs
[15:32:59] <dimi1947> right....and that is the problem...I am editing the data for one service group,so I should get 21 ONLY ONCE
[15:33:27] <dimi1947> I know that it is(probably) a selector problem
[15:33:54] <dimi1947> to put it another way...
[15:35:16] <dimi1947> I must get the ID either service updated,either price updated,either price visibility update..either all of them...but not get the ID each time one of them is updated in the SAME serv group
[15:35:46] <taplar> then i might suggest you doing the select, and then using http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.uniqueSort/ on it to remove duplicates, before looping over them
[15:36:39] <taplar> otherwise you could do an indexOf check on the array before pushing a value
[15:37:22] <dimi1947> talk to me about indexof...
[15:37:35] <dimi1947> how this can be done?
[15:37:48] <taplar> [ 21 ].indexOf( 21 ) would return 0, since that value is in the first index
[15:37:56] <taplar> if it was not in the array, indexOf would return -1
[15:38:21] <dimi1947> can you edit the fiddle to get a better picture of it?
[15:38:32] <taplar> so if (updateIDs.indexOf(ID) < 0) updateIDs.push(ID);
[15:39:42] <dimi1947> can you edit the fiddle cause I miss something here
[15:39:49] <dimi1947> please
[15:39:52] <taplar> that's pretty much it verbatum
[15:40:35] <taplar> that line replaces 110
[15:40:41] <dimi1947> taplar:ok...give me a min
[15:41:07] <robertmaxrees> dimi1947 give it a try based on taplar's suggestions and if it still doesn't work, share with us what you tried and we can point you in the right direction :)
[15:41:32] <dimi1947> taplar:there is nothing on line 110...did you mean line 107
[15:41:46] <taplar> ah, i've edited stuff
[15:42:06] <taplar> yes, 107
[15:43:24] <dimi1947> taplar:yes...this seems to work just fine
[15:45:03] <dimi1947> allthough I have not grsped it full yet
[15:45:13] <taplar> the indexOf part?
[15:45:18] <dimi1947> yeah
[15:45:30] <taplar> indexOf tells you the index that a value is at in an array
[15:46:25] <dimi1947> and if it is smaller than zero..what that meanw?
[15:46:30] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/Ldy22gL2/
[15:46:36] <robertmaxrees> ^ dimi1947 look at this example.
[15:46:36] <taplar> valid indexes of an array are 0-n
[15:46:44] <taplar> -1 means not found
[15:46:59] <taplar> err, technically 0-(n-1)
[15:47:02] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/indexOf also
[15:48:28] <dimi1947> so in other words...if the indexof is smaller than zero...than the array does not contain that element
[15:48:35] <taplar> yep
[15:49:26] <dimi1947> now I got it...thx...
[18:06:57] <DavidDenver> I need a simple cross-browser, pan and zoom, with clickable html image map.  Is there anything out there like that?  Simple pixel coordinates are preferred, this isn't for a gps/long/lat based map.
[18:17:07] <grapheti> DavidDenver: http://timmywil.github.io/jquery.panzoom/demo/
[18:17:12] <grapheti> Have fun!
[18:20:30] <Levin^> hi
[18:21:48] <robertmaxrees> good afternoon
[18:21:56] <Levin^> I forgot how to write "inside the element $(.melon), check if there are $(.seeds)"
[18:22:07] <Levin^> if not, remove() melon
[18:22:28] <robertmaxrees> well
[18:22:48] <robertmaxrees> so you select $('.melon'), right?
[18:22:57] <robertmaxrees> and you want to find any .seeds in it?
[18:23:24] <Levin^> .seeds are inside .melon
[18:23:36] <robertmaxrees> literally what i just said :)
[18:23:43] <Levin^> yea lol
[18:23:45] <robertmaxrees> i'd use .find()
[18:23:48] <Levin^> ohh
[18:25:30] <Levin^> but will that remove only that one .melon that there are no .seeds inside?
[18:25:38] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[18:25:44] <robertmaxrees> it's not a one-step solution.
[18:25:48] <Levin^> that's my worry
[18:25:51] <robertmaxrees> ,,,,
[18:25:52] <Levin^> hm
[18:25:57] <robertmaxrees> there's no one-step solution.
[18:26:16] <Levin^> ok, I'll keep googling
[18:26:20] <robertmaxrees> lol
[18:26:22] <robertmaxrees> we can help you
[18:26:29] <Levin^> lol
[18:26:30] <Levin^> hmm
[18:26:35] <robertmaxrees> you can .filter() off of $('.melon')
[18:26:53] <robertmaxrees> use a function to return any that don't have any child .seed selements
[18:26:56] <robertmaxrees> then .remove() them.
[18:27:11] <Levin^> ok
[18:28:48] <robertmaxrees> lemme know if you get stuck?
[18:29:26] <Levin^> ok
[18:35:18] <Levin^> well, I'm at this point
[18:35:18] <Levin^> https://codepen.io/anon/pen/vjxWRN?editors=1010
[18:35:32] <robertmaxrees> okay so.
[18:35:53] <robertmaxrees> first off - you doin't want the $(".melon").remove(); in the filter callback.
[18:35:56] <robertmaxrees> so delete that for now.
[18:36:07] <Levin^> ok
[18:36:36] <robertmaxrees> second, you want to make $(".seeds").length > 0 contextual
[18:36:48] <Levin^> .melon .seeds?
[18:37:02] <robertmaxrees> no - that'll search all .melon again
[18:37:06] <robertmaxrees> you want $(this)
[18:37:14] <Levin^> oh
[18:37:17] <robertmaxrees> $(this) would be the current melon in the filter.
[18:37:27] <robertmaxrees> third, you want to return that length check.
[18:37:40] <robertmaxrees> fourth, i thought you wanted to delete melons with no seeds?
[18:38:00] <Levin^> yes
[18:38:15] <robertmaxrees> $(".seeds").length > 0 means "length is greater than 0
[18:38:17] <robertmaxrees> "
[18:38:20] <Levin^> it doesn't look like?
[18:38:24] <Levin^> oops
[18:38:33] <robertmaxrees> so make those tweaks and show me what you've got :)
[18:38:41] <Levin^> I wrote .is :empty before
[18:38:50] <robertmaxrees> you could do a one-liner, too.
[18:38:56] <robertmaxrees> but .filter() is a good one to learn.
[18:39:07] <robertmaxrees> because it's so powerful.
[18:46:05] <Levin^> https://codepen.io/anon/pen/vjxWRN?editors=1010
[18:46:17] <Levin^> got quite stuck on how to return the lenght
[18:46:20] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[18:46:22] <Levin^> length*
[18:46:27] <robertmaxrees> lol
[18:46:35] <Levin^> lol
[18:46:47] <robertmaxrees> -_-
[18:47:05] <robertmaxrees> if you're gonna use .filter(), you don't need to use .has()
[18:47:08] <Levin^> you might undertand my logic there haha
[18:47:11] <robertmaxrees> hence why i suggested .find()
[18:47:27] <robertmaxrees> if you wanna use .has(), ditch the .filter()
[18:47:55] <Levin^> oh noes, time's up
[18:48:04] <Levin^> let's continue this in two days lol
[18:48:11] <robertmaxrees> uh
[18:48:12] <robertmaxrees> ok
[18:48:13] <Levin^> it's holiday in my country
[18:48:21] <Levin^> ^^'
[18:49:17] <Levin^> thanks your your support
[18:49:30] <robertmaxrees> (shrug)
[20:37:31] <DavidDenver> grapheti: thanks
[20:51:43] <DavidDenver> having gone through the docs at readme, it doesn't show how there can a defined, clickable, image map that hrefs to another page.  If one were to click to pan at a defined image map location, instead of panning, it would probably href to a page, which is not what I would want.  With any callback ability, it isn't definable to an image map location (polygon), at least not as far as I can see.
[20:52:12] <DavidDenver> I need a simple cross-browser, pan and zoom, with clickable html image map.  Is there anything out there like that?  Simple pixel coordinates are preferred, this isn't for a gps/long/lat based map.
[20:52:16] <DavidDenver> as a repost
[20:53:02] <DavidDenver> I need a url with a mwe that has these features and I can adapt from there.  I'm on a short timeline and am just looking for something very simple.
[23:06:40] <dw1> you can do that
[23:06:48] * dw1 was scrolled up, nm
