[04:48:13] <Jasein> if (typeof elem ==="object" ) { if (elem.is($)) //fails to identify a jquery object. What's the best way to identify if elem is a jquery object?
[04:54:15] <Jasein> I want to pass either an html element, a string, an array, or a jquery object to a function and be able to handle all of them. I can determine string, array, object, but not definitively a jquery object. how can I check if the value passed to a function is, in fact, a jquery object?
[04:56:52] <Jasein> nvm. going to figure it out without jquery using plain js
[05:32:32] <fattest> Hi everyone. How do I append HTML exactly how it is to a <p> element? http://jsfiddle.net/ytgbuen8/
[07:31:28] <Jasein> fattest, I take it you figured it out.
[16:02:14] <inthl> assuming I have set up an array with methods/functions, for example: foobar = []; foobar.func1 = function() { alert(123); } ... and I do this multiple times, with func1, func2, func3, .. how do I iterate through that array and depending on the name (func1) decide whether to run the function/method or not?
[16:04:10] <shoky_> inthl: you should not add properties like .func1 to an array, that's what you do with objects. foobar = {};   and you can get an object's keys with Object.keys(foobar)
[16:10:02] <inthl> shoky_, what I am doing is actually not that ordinary. it's about some lazy loading script, where functions may or may not be executed, depending on the scripts that are being loaded
[16:11:19] <inthl> the issue is that the functions may come from inline html <script> as well as included .js, and to manage the order I have to know what to execute at what time. my idea was to add these scripts to wrapper functions, then add the functions to an array and later decide what to do with them. this actually works pretty good, I'm just about to define the order and time when to run what
[16:12:29] <shoky_> inthl: you can use an array, but then don't add arbitrary properties like .func1 to it. array is meant to be keyed by the indexes, for ordered access of the items
[16:13:02] <shoky_> inthl: so you can .push() your functions to the array.  and if you want to include additional data like the name (func1) then wrap the function in an object
[16:13:21] <inthl> the properties may be the names of the .js files, e.g. foobar.js, this is why I'd add it as functions.foobar = function() ..
[16:13:26] <shoky_> e.g.  foobar.push({name: 'func1', func: func1})
[16:13:33] <inthl> ah
[16:14:22] <inthl> but the definition of the name happens in the included .js, which starts as functions.foobar = function() { ..here comes the usual .js file  code } - then later I am just deciding whether to run functions.foobar();
[16:15:07] <inthl> so how would I add that code from the js as you suggested to actually have foobar with {name: 'func1', func: func1} ?
[16:15:07] <shoky_> Object.keys(functions) will give you all the names then, if i understand you right
[16:15:16] <inthl> yes, that's the case
[16:15:20] <shoky_> but that won't guarantee an ordering
[16:15:48] <inthl> actually that is not a problem, I've got the order in the referencing array already, which decides what to execute and in what order
[16:16:14] <inthl> so my checking function just needs to have the key's names in that functions array, nothing more
[16:16:26] <shoky_> object, not array ;p
[16:16:38] <inthl> sure
[16:17:49] <inthl> so is there a way to add the code within a .js file just like {name: 'func1', func: func1} ? starting the file with functions.foobar = function() { ..here-comes-the-js-code.. } doesn't do that as mentioned
[16:17:50] <shoky_> and in case you dont know - you can do  functions[name] to access functions.<name> property
[16:18:01] <shoky_> where name could be a variable
[16:18:33] <shoky_> i'm not sure what you're asking
[16:19:34] <inthl> > and in case you dont know ... no I did not, thanks, I was looking for that :>
[16:19:41] <inthl> let me restate my question then
[16:21:38] <inthl> as mentioned, I am including a set of different .js files in my document. now all these .js are wrapped in a function block, which is the mentioned: functions.foobar = function() { ..here comes the usual .js file  code } ... so later I can decide whether I want to run functions['foobar'](); - you stated that I should not do it like this (shoky_: 'you should not add properties like .func1 to an array, that's what you do with objects. foobar
[16:21:38] <inthl> = {};')
[16:22:19] <inthl> my question was: how should I do it then, as you proposed with foobar.push({name: 'func1', func: func1}) - I mean: what exactly should I write into the head of that .js file then?
[16:22:33] <inthl> instead of: functions.foobar = function() { ..here comes the usual .js file  code }
[16:22:56] <shoky_> what i suggested is to use {} instead of []  to define the functions object
[16:23:05] <shoky_> i donno where you define it first..
[16:24:09] <inthl> ah, okay, I just changed [] to {}, it actually does not make a difference, but it's an object now :>
[16:24:47] <shoky_> it makes a difference to whoever will read your code
[16:24:48] <shoky_> :p
[16:24:55] <inthl> hopefully nobody
[16:25:16] <shoky_> you never know - and "whoever" includes yourself, tomorrow, or in 3 months :p
[16:27:11] <shoky_> and by "makes a difference" i mean it makes your code easier to understand. because if you had functions = [];   then i would expect you to use it as an array, not an object, and so confusion would arise.  (it just happens that in JS, arrays are also objects)
[16:29:31] <inthl> yes I guessed so, since it behaves the very same since that change. thanks for shining a light into my dark $env here :>
[16:54:33] <shoky_> np
[19:02:19] <Jasein> How can I get the selector string for a jquery object?
[19:14:36] <shoky_> Jasein: you cannot. and not all jquery objects have selectors
[19:16:30] <Jasein> when I try console.log($(".test")) I get two nodes, for example. Each has a string for a value, I need that string. Somebody somewhere generated it
[19:17:56] <shoky_> they don't have strings for values, they have DOM elements
[19:18:28] <shoky_> and if you see a DOM element with a text reprensentation in your console - that's your browser/console doing it, not JS/jquery
[19:18:49] <shoky_> (if i understood what you meant)
[19:19:24] <Jasein> i'll paste what I see. thanks for your help. brb
[19:21:14] <Jasein> https://imgur.com/a/LTplBpU
[19:22:06] <shoky_> yes that's what i was referring to, then
[19:22:36] <shoky_> you can get their id or class attributes with .attr('id')   .attr('class')  if that helps :p
[19:22:56] <jak2000> hi all, wich way is better for convert meters to inches? and others.... i think in have a database table with equivalences, but i am not sure...
[19:23:31] <Jasein> that's ridiculous that there is no easy way to get a direct selector from a jquery object ugg. Okay, I'll figure it out. Thanks for your help.
[19:23:52] <shoky_> Jasein: as you can see, the text for the 3rd element there is just "div.test"  which is NOT a selector for that element (it's a selector for multiple elements)
[19:24:01] <shoky_> so even having that text would not be helpful most likely.
[19:24:32] <shoky_> Jasein: there are ways to create a css selector for an element, but they are not pretty ;)
[19:24:57] <shoky_> bunch of examples here  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3620116/get-css-path-from-dom-element
[19:25:05] <shoky_> nothing to do with jquery tho
[19:25:21] <Jasein> don't spose xpath is gonna work either is it.
[19:27:36] <shoky_> does it work for you? there are non-pretty ways to do the same for xpath
[19:29:07] <shoky_> anyways in _most_ cases where you think you have this requirement.. there are probably better ways to do whatever it is you originally needed to do. i.e. an XY problem
[19:29:44] <shoky_> (you need to achieve X, you think Y is the way to do it. so you ask about Y, without even mentioning X)
[19:33:04] <Jasein> I hear ya. I was asking exactly what I wanted. I just don't think it's going to work. I wanted to use the "selector string" as the key in an object. I'll just add a property for the element and return an array.
[19:33:36] <Jasein> I wanted to get the dimensions of any number of elements and have an associative array returned where the index was the element selector.
[19:34:56] <Jasein> let theObject = {"div#obj1.test": { width: 100, height: 100 },
[19:34:56] <Jasein>   "div#obj2.test":{width: 200, height: 200 }
[19:34:56] <Jasein> };
[19:51:26] <jak2000> hi all, wich way is better for convert meters to inches? and others.... i think in have a database table with equivalences, but i am not sure...
[19:54:51] <Jasein> That doesn't sound like something jquery would be inclined to handle for you. Maybe check #math...not sure what you are looking for...there may be a js library but check #javascript
[19:55:28] <jak2000> thanks
[20:14:29] <shoky_> Jasein: `I wanted to use the "selector string" as the key in an object` still looks suspiciously like a Y :p
[20:15:26] <shoky_> with a Map or WeakMap you could have the elements themselves be the keys, if that helps you any
[20:15:42] <shoky_> (if i remember correctly. have not really used that feature hardly)
[21:44:48] <jak2000> under a HTML textarea can i style text? increment the size?
