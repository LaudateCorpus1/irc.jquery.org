[00:07:17] <wer0ckz> Hi. help please. http://jsfiddle.net/H7Lc2/1/ - the div "selectall" is not selecting the textarea
[00:07:39] <fabioportieri> morning
[00:12:25] <okdamn> hey how do i detect if user is scrolling or not?
[00:13:05] <Cork> wer0ckz: why would that work?
[00:13:11] <xec_> wer0ckz: there are so many things weird/wrong about that demo
[00:13:14] <Cork> on click you bind a focus on a none existing element
[00:13:17] <xec_> i'm not sure where to start
[00:13:43] <xec_> wer0ckz: you nest three event bindings+handlers inside each other
[00:13:49] <Cork> and then you call a none existing function (.select()) if this none existing element is focused
[00:13:56] <xec_> there is no #foo
[00:14:04] <wer0ckz> oh my bad
[00:14:07] <xec_> #textarea is not a textarea (it's a div)
[00:14:08] <wer0ckz> let me update the code
[00:14:23] <wer0ckz> http://jsfiddle.net/H7Lc2/3/
[00:14:38] <fabioportieri> okdamn: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6271237/detecting-when-user-scrolls-to-bottom-of-div-with-jquery
[00:15:03] <wer0ckz> im trying to follow this one http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5797539/jquery-select-all-text-from-a-textarea
[00:15:19] <Cork> wer0ckz: a div natively can't have focus
[00:15:20] <xec_> wer0ckz: http://jsfiddle.net/H7Lc2/4/
[00:15:22] <BFranks> wer0ckz: Most people asking this question really want http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2805009/how-to-actually-use-zeroclipboard-in-jquery ?
[00:15:23] <okdamn> thanks fabioportieri i found this too http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9144560/jquery-scroll-detect-when-user-stops-scrolling
[00:15:37] <wer0ckz> omg
[00:15:40] <wer0ckz> thank you
[00:15:44] <okdamn> it seems exactly what i need, the bad thing is it sets timeouts
[00:15:46] <okdamn> :/
[00:16:14] <Cork> xec_: where does the select() function come from?
[00:16:31] <BFranks> Ahh updated here: http://www.steamdev.com/zclip/
[00:16:35] <xec_> ?select
[00:16:36] <bot-t> .select(handler): Bind an event handler to the "select" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/select/
[00:16:52] <Cork> wow
[00:17:03] <Cork> that one has totally missed my radar!
[00:17:06] <xec_> :D
[00:18:02] <Cork> but as far as i can tell it doesn't let you set what to select?
[00:18:17] <xec_> "In addition, the default select action on the field will be fired, so the entire text field will be selected"
[00:18:30] <xec_> so no, not if you want part of the textarea/input
[00:18:35] <xec_> just the entire thing
[00:18:38] <Cork> so thats a no; (less impressed)
[00:18:54] <Cork> cause that still means i need my custom code :)
[00:19:09] <xec_> yeah, nasty native api ftl
[00:19:25] <Cork> especially as ie has its super special thing
[00:19:38] <xec_> don't remind me, i still have nightmares
[00:19:42] <Cork> lol
[00:20:04] <Cork> btw you know if it's been fixed in ie10? (haven't checked)
[00:20:27] <xec_> not sure, but they have fixed a lot, so i would assume so
[00:20:45] <Cork> ya, that was why i asked
[00:24:20] <amaroks> Hey guys
[00:24:48] <wer0ckz> hi. can you use  $("#myDIV").select(); in a normal text? not in a textarea?
[00:25:17] <Cork> no
[00:28:17] <houser> hello, how can i put the product lines all the way to the left in this example: http://jsfiddle.net/KqBx8/ ?
[00:28:45] <houser> http://jsfiddle.net/KqBx8/1/
[00:30:28] <Cork> houser: clear: both on the table (you should be asking this in #css though)
[00:30:53] <Cork> a better choice would be to add a wrapper around the top part
[00:31:01] <Cork> with overflow: hidden;
[00:31:31] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/KqBx8/2/
[00:33:53] <houser> Cork, ahhh perfect. Thank you :) WHy is it better to have a wrapper around the top part with overflow: hidden?
[00:34:20] <Cork> houser: cause clear:both affect things that isn't in that scope
[00:34:37] <Cork> one sec let me try making an example
[00:35:30] <houser> aha
[00:38:59] <Cork> aaand of course i compleately fail at making the example...
[00:40:06] <Cork> houser: btw you have errors in your html, you should run it through validation
[00:40:26] <houser> Cork, oh really?
[00:40:31] <houser> what am i doing wrong
[00:40:38] <Cork> <td> product name</td></td>
[00:40:49] <Cork> (there might be more)
[00:42:01] <houser> ill look through it. thank you very much :)

[00:51:22] <Cork> a wonder?
[00:54:40] <houser> Cork, can i ask you another question regarding the same code?
[00:54:56] <Cork> houser: don't ask to ask
[00:55:40] <bigLanky> http://jsfiddle.net/eDhBM/3/ <-- hover over the products link. how can i add a smooth sliding instead of a snap?
[00:57:19] <houser> Cork, ah, i found it hehe :)
[00:57:39] <Cork> houser: .animate()
[00:57:47] <houser> Cork, animate?
[00:57:50] <Cork> there is slideDown but not slideLeft

[00:58:29] <houser> bigLanky,
[00:58:47] <Cork> uh,,, i meant slide right :x
[00:58:51] <Cork> :D
[00:59:15] <Cork> houser: you could also have a look at transition
[00:59:22] <Cork> ?mdc transition
[00:59:28] <bot-t> Cork, transition - CSS | MDN - The CSS transition property is a shorthand property for transition-property , transition-duration , transition-timing-function , and transition-delay .

[01:00:39] <philhutchinson> bigLanky: just animate the CSS change
[01:00:44] <philhutchinson> using something like animate({left: '-200%', }, 1000 );
[01:03:20] <Snoopal> hey guys. I'm using var focused = $(:focus');  and i want to get the name of the focused element but if i us $(focused).attr('name'); i only get "undefined"
[01:03:26] <houser> , is it better to set html-table width of columns using the html attribute or using css?
[01:03:26] <Snoopal> any idea?
[01:03:50] <Cork> Snoopal: 1. focused is already a jquery object so no need to $() wrapp it
[01:04:10] <Snoopal> what would the correct syntax be?
[01:04:18] <Cork> focused.attr()
[01:04:34] <Cork> though name should still be true as long as the targeted element has a name
[01:04:51] <Cork> (be true == should still work with your code)
[01:04:55] <Snoopal> "undefinied" :(
[01:05:00] <ph88> i have this in a loop and it takes a long time, how can i speed it up ?     $("<option></option>").attr("value",Key).text(Value)
[01:05:13] <Cork> what is focused[0].tagName ?
[01:05:24] <Cork> houser: style belongs in the css
[01:05:54] <Cork> ph88: that part should be fairly quick, its when you append it to the page that can be slow
[01:06:08] <Cork> (unless you append it in one big chunk)
[01:06:38] <ph88> well i had append in the loop, im moving it outside now
[01:06:45] <ph88> it's a select box with 3000 options
[01:06:51] <Snoopal> cork: TypeError: focused[0] is undefinied
[01:07:06] <Cork> Snoopal: focused === undefined?
[01:07:26] <Cork> uh
[01:07:27] <Cork> sorry
[01:07:33] <Cork> focused.length == 0 ?
[01:08:06] <ph88> Cork:  perhaps i .html with strings is faster then append objects ?
[01:08:24] <Snoopal> yes its 0
[01:08:33] <Cork> ph88: not necessary if you do it right, but ya
[01:08:56] <Cork> Snoopal: where are you running $(':focus') ?
[01:09:06] <Snoopal> on focus out of another element
[01:09:34] <Cork> that will be before the focus change
[01:09:44] <Snoopal> yep thats what i just realized
[01:09:46] <Snoopal> :(
[01:10:48] <Cork> Snoopal: you're better of doing something like => var focused; $(document).on('focus', function(event) { focused = $(event.target); });
[01:11:25] <ph88> Cork:  changing the html with 3000 options freezes my browser somewhat ....  what can i do ?
[01:11:33] <Snoopal> is there a way to get the name of the element which was focused before?
[01:11:38] <Cork> ph88: pb the loop
[01:11:43] <ph88> pb ?
[01:11:50] <Cork> ?p @ ph88
[01:11:51] <bot-t> ph88, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[01:12:20] <Cork> Snoopal: var oldFocused; oldFocused = focused; focused = $(event.target); ?
[01:12:25] <ph88> ok it's gonna take while for me to make that test case
[01:12:33] <Snoopal> hm true story
[01:13:06] <Snoopal> ill try i that way! thanks
[01:19:17] <Snoopal> $(document).on('focus') does not trigger
[01:19:44] <gordian> does not trigger what?
[01:20:12] <Snoopal> i did $(document).on('focus',function(event) { alert("boa"); });
[01:20:23] <Snoopal> i don't get alert when i focus on an input field
[01:21:22] <bigLanky> philhutchinson: check http://jsfiddle.net/eDhBM/5/
[01:21:28] <bigLanky> did i put the .animate in there correctly?
[01:21:31] <Cork> hmm
[01:21:33] <lejocelyn> do you know why this combo box http://jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#combobox doesn't work?
[01:21:47] <Cork> Snoopal: gah, right focus doens't bubble
[01:21:47] <lejocelyn> I can see the issue with the input not being defined
[01:21:53] <Cork> Snoopal: you need focusin
[01:21:57] <lejocelyn> but I don't understand why it's not defined
[01:22:11] <Cork> Snoopal: http://jsfiddle.net/Mrh6J/
[01:22:44] <ph88> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/EX57m/
[01:22:53] <Snoopal> thanks
[01:23:04] <ph88> i'm doing something wrong there though :|
[01:23:43] <Cork> ph88: as far as i know complete.('make'+i) isn't possible in js
[01:23:51] <ph88> oki
[01:24:55] <Cork> ph88: http://jsfiddle.net/EX57m/1/
[01:25:24] <ph88> thx Cork
[01:25:35] <Cork> also you can do $("<option/>")
[01:25:43] <Cork> no need for the closing tag
[01:26:19] <Snoopal> focusing triggers at the moment when the site is loaded even when i do not focus on a input field?
[01:26:33] <Snoopal> *focusin
[01:26:38] <Cork> Snoopal: it triggers as an element is focused yes
[01:26:44] <Cork> (if nothing else document)
[01:28:01] <Snoopal> but i only need this function if i got a focus on an input field
[01:28:33] <Cork> so you want it to filter on the last focused input field?
[01:29:31] <Cork> this is the least costly way to do it, just so you know
[01:29:53] <Snoopal> not in every caseâ€¦ actually i have a feedback form. if somebody selects "bad" he/she needs to fill out a text area. but if he/she overthnks its mind and changes the radio not to "bad" the user is not supposed to fill out the textarea
[01:30:10] <Cork> but if you need it you can do $(document).on('focusin', function(event) { if(event.target.nodeName === 'INPUT') })
[01:30:43] <Cork> ok?
[01:30:53] <dzarzagza> how do i fix my site so that when u scroll up or down, it goes to the bottom of the page or to the top of the page?
[01:30:55] <Cork> why not just check that when the radio is changed?
[01:31:14] <dzarzagza> heres a demo: http://doublenine.site50.net/websites/80spurplefrontpage/ it works when i scroll down, but not up
[01:31:15] <Snoopal> because i need to know in which text area the user was before
[01:31:34] <Snoopal> hmm
[01:31:34] <Cork> well then do the if checks
[01:31:45] <Snoopal> but i could save the text area he focuses in
[01:31:50] <dzarzagza> and code http://doublenine.site50.net/websites/80spurplefrontpage/js/main.js
[01:31:51] <Cork> you can do $(event.target).is(':input')
[01:32:42] <Cork> dzarzagza: why would you want to break the scroll feature of the browser?!?
[01:33:22] <dzarzagza> i want the effect of this page: http://chanel.com
[01:33:49] <Cork> ok?
[01:34:12] <dzarzagza> like when u scroll down, a menu appears
[01:34:13] <Cork> ah
[01:34:24] <Cork> well no it animates when the scroll has started
[01:34:48] <Cork> dzarzagza: you would have to store the last scroll position
[01:34:55] <Cork> and check in what direction it has changed
[01:35:09] <Cork> if(old - new < 0)
[01:35:28] <Cork> and trigger the animation in the different direction from that
[01:36:11] <dzarzagza> ok i'll try that
[01:36:32] <dzarzagza> can u tell me whats wrong with the logic i have right now? http://doublenine.site50.net/websites/80spurplefrontpage/js/main.js at the bottom
[01:36:56] <dzarzagza> im gonna rewrite it right now anyways
[01:37:28] <Cork> your scrolling to height instead of scrollHeight is one thing
[01:37:40] <jquery_rookie> hey i need help
[01:38:02] <jquery_rookie> about a jquery hover
[01:38:11] <jquery_rookie> http://jsfiddle.net/xgbV9/
[01:38:20] <Lucaszz> Hi I have medium difficult problem with jquery
[01:38:53] <jquery_rookie> the problem is that i have a meny that swith pictures on hover
[01:39:07] <Lucaszz> I have to do ajax asynchronious
[01:39:23] <Lucaszz> but I want to do rest of code synchroniuos
[01:39:41] <Lucaszz> jquery $.when doesnt works in that case
[01:39:49] <jquery_rookie> and a ui list is shown on the hover
[01:40:03] <Cork> Lucaszz: you can't really have ajax syncronus (without horrible problems for the user)
[01:40:22] <Cork> and no matter what tool you use the code around it can't be sync
[01:40:27] <Lucaszz> Cork: I will show you what I want to do
[01:40:37] <jquery_rookie> but when i hover over the ui list the img is swithed back and the list is hidden again
[01:40:48] <jquery_rookie> http://jsfiddle.net/xgbV9/
[01:40:58] <Cork> jquery_rookie: you're example isn't working
[01:41:09] <Cork> all there is is a title
[01:41:15] <jquery_rookie> i don't know why
[01:41:17] <Cork> *header
[01:41:29] <Cork> cause the images are missing?
[01:41:55] <Cork> (and css)
[01:43:23] <Lucaszz> Cork: This what I want to do: http://pastebin.com/nrKD9XQH
[01:43:32] <jquery_rookie> tried to add the header but the img isn't on internet get
[01:44:03] <Cork> Lucaszz: yes, but you can't do that
[01:44:27] <Cork> return values depends on the code executing syncronus
[01:44:39] <Cork> and the answer from ajax won't come before the function ends
[01:44:44] <Cork> so it can't EVER return it
[01:46:04] <Lucaszz> Cork: Maybe is in jquery some function with forces synchronious execution ...? Sth similar to when? http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.when/
[01:46:32] <Cork> Lucaszz: when doens't do synchronious
[01:46:59] <Dragooon_Mac> Which theme does the JQM doc site use?
[01:47:02] <Cork> Lucaszz: only way to make what you want is to have the browser FREES until the server has sent the answer
[01:47:07] <Cork> and then continue execution
[01:47:24] <Cork> but that means the browser stays dead until the answer comes or the connection timesout
[01:47:29] <Cork> *times out
[01:48:06] <Lucaszz> freezing browser by async:false is ver bad idea ;p
[01:48:15] <Cork> yes
[01:48:29] <Cork> Lucaszz: async ajax calls means the browser unwinds the javascript stacks; and when it gets back to the event loop it starts the network call
[01:48:44] <Cork> and then it calls the callback when the responses comes in
[01:48:48] <Lucaszz> Ok so I have to rewrite my code to asynchronious
[01:48:52] <Cork> yes
[01:49:21] <jquery_rookie> help
[01:49:57] <Cork> jquery_rookie: you need to make the jsfiddle example work, else there isn't much to work iwth
[01:49:59] <Cork> *with
[01:51:05] <Dragooon_Mac> Anyone? Or does it use some custom theme?
[01:57:50] <houser> to find hidden fields i do: $('#cartsummarytable').find('input[type=hidden]'); this returns an array. How do i find the entry in this array which has the attribute value with value set to 5?
[01:58:15] <beasty_> morning guys
[01:58:36] <Dragooon_Mac> houser: $('#cartsummarytable').find('input[type=hidden][value=5]');
[01:59:09] <Dragooon_Mac> Or loop through the array using $.each and match individual value
[01:59:31] <benjick> Hi. I'm looking to draw a square over an image and get the cords for this square. Any pointers where I might want to start?
[01:59:53] <houser> Dragooon_Mac, thanks
[01:59:55] <Dragooon_Mac> benjick: You want to draw the square before knowing the coordinates?
[02:00:00] <Dragooon_Mac> How?
[02:00:23] <benjick> Dragooon_Mac: I'm sorry if i'm unclear. I want to drag the box with the mouse and get coords to store
[02:00:23] <Cork> ?.position @ benjick

[02:00:44] <Cork> and then grab its .left and .top and width() and height()
[02:01:37] <benjick> Cork: Uhm, no, I guess I explain bad, sorry, english is not my native language
[02:02:02] <benjick> I want to display an image, then with the mouse "paint" a box and get the cords from that
[02:02:09] <dziegler> Hi , is it possible to render a div element as png for a mouse over preview?
[02:02:18] <Cork> benjick: ya?
[02:02:42] <clocKwize> guys, I'm trying to .click() an A tag - its just not doing anything? (in this 1 specific caseâ€¦) any ideas why that could be?
[02:02:43] <benjick> Cork: So position() would only get me coords of an already existing box?
[02:02:45] <clocKwize> its got a href, etc
[02:02:46] <Cork> benjick: you put a div ontop and move resize it when the drag happens
[02:03:00] <clocKwize> doing window.location.href = $("â€¦").attr("href") goes to the page
[02:03:05] <Lucaszz> Cork: What did you think about that solve of my problem? http://pastebin.com/svZYuCYC
[02:03:08] <benjick> Cork: Ah, yes, that's true! Thanks
[02:03:20] <Cork> benjick: then you take the cordinats of the absolute positioned div, and reduce it with the top and left from the image
[02:04:44] <benjick> Cork: Thank you
[02:05:05] <Cork> Lucaszz: why not just function getAsyncAjaxData() { return $.ajax(); }; getAsyncAjaxData().done(DoSthElseWithData); ?
[02:05:27] <dclaude> could it be, that calling jQuery("#field1").blur() deletes the existing onblur-attribute of the field #field1?
[02:06:04] <Cork> dclaude: no blur doens't delete any attributes
[02:06:23] <Lucaszz> Cork: because of my ignorance ;p
[02:08:52] <dclaude> cork: curious
[02:09:01] <dclaude> i have the following test
[02:09:09] <dclaude>     "test" : function() {
[02:09:10] <dclaude>         var jqField = jQuery("#field1");
[02:09:12] <dclaude>         assertNotUndefined(jqField.attr("onblur"));
[02:09:13] <dclaude>         jqField.blur();
[02:09:15] <dclaude>         assertNotUndefined(jqField.attr("onblur"));
[02:09:16] <dclaude>     }
[02:09:17] <Cork> ...
[02:09:22] <Cork> don't dump code in the channel
[02:09:26] <Cork> use a pb
[02:09:26] <Cork> ?p
[02:09:27] <bot-t> Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[02:09:30] <dclaude> and it fails with: AssertError: expected not undefined but was undefined
[02:09:51] <dclaude> sorry, you are right
[02:09:58] <dclaude> next time
[02:10:00] <dclaude> i promise
[02:10:02] <dclaude> ;)
[02:10:27] <Cork> dclaude: btw, why are you using old inline event properties?
[02:10:37] <Cork> you should be using event listeners instead
[02:10:53] <Cork> (event properties is for legacy support)
[02:11:59] <dclaude> it is for legacy support
[02:12:36] <Cork> event properties is dom1, event listeners is dom2
[02:12:51] <Cork> event properties doens't interact with event listeners
[02:13:01] <Cork> so you get a mess if you use both
[02:13:09] <dclaude> i don't do that
[02:13:19] <dzarzagza> Cork: i got it to determine if its going up or down. still dont know how to get it to scroll down and up properly
[02:13:22] <dzarzagza> http://jsfiddle.net/bwxQG/1/
[02:13:24] <clocKwize> how can I find out whats stopping a button click
[02:13:56] <dclaude> i am just writing js code, which removes the inline event propterties and registers event listeners instead
[02:14:00] <Cork> clocKwize: depends
[02:14:20] <Cork> if its stopped through preventDefault() you can check for that
[02:14:40] <Cork> if its stopped through return false; you will have to hunt for event listeners, cause there is no way to detect that
[02:14:47] <beasty_> morning y'all
[02:14:51] <beasty_> oh hi Cork :)
[02:14:56] <Cork> o/
[02:15:01] <clocKwize> Cork: ok ta..how would I go about it then?
[02:15:08] <clocKwize> just have a link that won't click
[02:15:14] <clocKwize> can't work out why
[02:15:19] <clocKwize> can't find any js that would affect it
[02:15:29] <Cork> clocKwize: first, check if you have an element covering it
[02:15:33] <Cork> (inspect the dom)
[02:15:43] <clocKwize> it won't click with js
[02:15:47] <clocKwize> $(..).click()
[02:16:28] <Cork> you can't fake native clicks on links
[02:16:45] <Cork> you can only trigger event listeners
[02:16:54] <Cork> (and event properties)
[02:16:57] <clocKwize> yeah
[02:18:01] <interop_madness> i have a website that's configured to Windows Authentication in IIS. requesting the site works well (and authentication is actually performed correctly) , however subsequent $.ajax() calls fail with 401 errors. any ideas why?
[02:18:13] <clocKwize> its working fine if I manually click it
[02:18:26] <clocKwize> but when I run through phantoms, it does nothing
[02:18:35] <Cork> dclaude: WFM http://jsfiddle.net/wL3Qw/
[02:19:21] <Cork> clocKwize: that is expected behavior
[02:19:30] <clocKwize> >.<
[02:19:43] <clocKwize> confused
[02:20:15] <Cork> clocKwize: if you want to replace the current page you can do window.location = $(this).attr('href');
[02:20:30] <Cork> but ya it won't be the same as a link click
[02:20:50] <clocKwize> why can't I just click it though? every other link on every other page works when I click it, except this one >.<
[02:21:08] <Cork> clocKwize: cause you try to click it from code
[02:21:17] <Cork> and the browser has explicit code to prevent that
[02:21:24] <clocKwize> why would it?
[02:21:38] <clocKwize> its my code on my page, with no js code on it that would prevent it
[02:21:57] <Cork> cause it (was) used for working around popup blockers and things like that
[02:22:17] <Cork> clocKwize: but its not in your browser, it is in the visitors browser
[02:22:22] <clocKwize> but it works for every other link I have..
[02:22:40] <Cork> the browsers primary obligation is to the user, not the site
[02:22:51] <Cork> clocKwize: not code clicking
[02:22:56] <clocKwize> I know
[02:23:06] <Cork> $('a').first().click() won't ever work
[02:23:16] <clocKwize> but what makes this link different from the one on the previous page?
[02:23:17] <clocKwize> O.o
[02:23:23] <clocKwize> the one i clicked to get to this page
[02:23:24] <clocKwize> with js
[02:23:43] <dclaude> cork: thx so far, i guess i have to find out why my test brings up another behavior
[02:24:01] <Cork> prob cause you have code that does $('a').click(function(event) { event.preventDefault() window.location = this.href; })
[02:24:16] <clocKwize> no, I have no code on it
[02:24:26] <Cork> then you can't click it with code
[02:24:28] <clocKwize> thats why I want to see what events are attached to it
[02:24:46] <Cork> clocKwize: do you have a link?
[02:24:50] <clocKwize> no, its local
[02:24:59] <clocKwize> I'm running integration tests against a site i'm develpoing
[02:25:26] <Cork> well the basics is clear, without js you can't (through js) click it
[02:25:43] <Cork> so testing it that way won't prove anything
[02:25:52] <Cork> instead check if something is covering the element
[02:26:08] <clocKwize> nothing is covering it, or phantomjs would complain
[02:26:12] <Cork> that would result in the link not getting clicked (it's the most common cause)
[02:26:39] <Cork> well can't really help you without the code
[02:29:56] <ph88> Cork:  i'm trying your solution, it works in another place of the code but not here:  http://i.imgur.com/wKkUFjN.png   i'm staring myself blind not seeing what i'm doing wrong :|
[02:39:49] <fulminator> hello, can someone help me pass a variable between succesive jquery ui functions? http://jsfiddle.net/fulminator/FqGME/20/
[02:40:13] <Cork> ph88: i don't fully follow the question
[02:40:19] <Cork> ph88: what is the problem?
[02:40:36] <fulminator> look into the fiddle, I have comment the stuff that I need
[02:40:47] <fulminator> I have this variable it's called moves
[02:40:47] <soee> how can i check if some function exists inside if statement?
[02:41:07] <ph88> Cork: JS execution stops at line 253, but there are 84 elements in the makeValue array ... at this was just the first iteration !
[02:41:15] <Cork> soee: typeof(func) == "undefined"
[02:41:25] <Cork> ph88: what is the error?
[02:41:53] <ph88> Cork: i'm just using firebug, it's not showing any error and i don't know how i can make it show an error about this
[02:42:30] <Cork> ph88: and when it gets to that line it just jumps out?
[02:44:17] <ph88> when it's AT the line (breakpoint at line) it holds ... Then click "play"   after that   javascript execution stops (not sure if that is the same as jumping out)
[02:44:24] <tomByrer> Hello, did you guys notice that bugs.jquery.com is down?
[02:44:52] <Cork> ph88: hit f10 instead of play
[02:44:56] <ph88> oki
[02:45:04] <fulminator> hello, can someone help me pass a variable between succesive jquery ui functions? http://jsfiddle.net/fulminator/FqGME/20/
[02:45:04] <Cork> if it jumps out of the execution you have an exception
[02:45:21] <Cork> (and you should see it in the firebug/firefox console
[02:45:33] <Cork> (if you don't see it in firebug check in ctrl+shift+k)
[02:46:26] <Cork> fulminator: what variable is it you need to pass?=
[02:47:51] <seutje> think he wants to check collision between draggable and droppable
[02:48:08] <tomByrer> Do you guys have any info on jQ's Source Maps plz?
[02:48:16] <fulminator> moves
[02:48:39] <fulminator> no, just read the comments into playGame function and you will understand what I need
[02:49:05] <fulminator> the collision check between draggable and droppable it works fine with the function checkCorrelation()
[02:49:50] <fulminator> but I do not know how to pass the moves variable (I have tried making it even global), so that it can change it's value inside the playGame() function and not only in makeToy() function
[02:50:53] <ph88> Cork:   ctrl+k helped ! it says:  TypeError: newOptions.and is not a function
[02:51:08] <Cork> hmm
[02:51:11] <Cork> ?.and
[02:51:13] <bot-t> Cork, #11483 ("current" context for add) – jQuery Core - Bug Tracker - Opened 4 weeks ago http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/11483
[02:51:17] <Cork> ?.add
[02:51:18] <bot-t> .add(selector): Add elements to the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/add/
[02:51:29] <Cork> man... i never remember the name of that function
[02:51:35] <Cork> ph88: sorry replace and with add
[02:51:54] <ph88> :D
[02:54:05] <fulminator> Cork: have you looked into my fiddle?
[02:55:19] <Cork> ah
[02:55:31] <fulminator> ?
[02:56:19] <Cork> first if you give a variable to a function you give it a copy
[02:56:27] <ph88> Cork: it's so slow that the browser throws a popup if i want to execute the script (and i will go out of this chat if the browser hangs)  and then in my other browser Iron (= Chrome)  the whole webpage just froze -___-
[02:56:38] <Cork> so wrap moves in an object and pass that around
[02:57:00] <Cork> var status = { moves: 2 }; makeToy(..., status);
[02:57:24] <Cork> fulminator: the rest i'm affraid might be caused by event asyncness
[02:57:32] <fulminator> hmm...
[02:57:34] <Cork> but i don't really follow what the code is meant to do so...
[02:57:34] <fulminator> what can I do?
[02:57:58] <Cork> fulminator: to be honest i'm basically guessing, as i don't follow what you're tying to do
[02:59:19] <fulminator> Cork: well, I have multiple persons (div droppable) and multiple toys (div draggable); if I give to a person a correct toy, moves--, until it reaches to zero. when moves is 0, the game is over.
[02:59:53] <fulminator> Cork: this is the best code I have come to in 2 days. checkCorrelation is been giving by someone here on this channel, because I am new to ui
[03:00:14] <sacho> cork's code can beat up your code
[03:00:24] * sacho shakes fist and chants!
[03:01:51] <fulminator> sacho: yes I know that, I am new to ui, and even to programming
[03:01:54] <DRSK> Hi guys, Just wondering what a good method would be to "scroll" or "slide" X elements in the viewable area of a div. Vertically. I have a div that has an area of 100x600 visibsible. That allows for let's say 5 list items to show. When firing the "down" arrow, I'd like to slide the current 5 items upwards out of the viewable area and push in the next 5. The idea can be seen here: http://jquery.lemmonjuice.com/plugins/slider-variable-widths
[03:02:35] <DRSK> I'm sure it's been done so many times there's a "best practise" or good way of doing so!
[03:02:51] <sacho> DRSK, I think it's called a carousel
[03:03:12] <sacho> just use margins and overflow hidden
[03:03:14] <fulminator> DRSK: your links is not found
[03:03:17] <sacho> and some math
[03:04:25] <DRSK> sacho: I was going to use some margins, and it already has overflow hidden, however I'm not quite sure what a good way (and efficient one at that) would be to decide how far to push the negative margin value of say the first 5?
[03:04:37] <DRSK> fulminator: oddly enough it does for me
[03:04:48] <Cork> ph88: http://jsfiddle.net/eB2fb/1/
[03:04:53] <sacho> if your items have fixed with, widthx5
[03:05:09] <Cork> ph88: sounds like you are still triggering reflow somewhere
[03:05:10] <DRSK> outerWidth x5, but in my case it'd be height for a vertical "carousel"
[03:05:13] <motaka2> is this right ? $("input,select").css("border", "1px solid #6891c1");
[03:05:19] <sacho> if you're simply moving x pixels every time, then x...I mean, I don't see the problem
[03:05:38] <sacho> DRSK, you're not pushing the margin of the items, put them in a container
[03:05:50] <sacho> Container(overflow-hidden) Inner-Container Items
[03:07:03] <ph88> Cork:  your script also kind of freezes my browser :|
[03:07:17] <Cork> then its the pure loop time
[03:07:33] <Cork> you could break it up into sections and give the browser time to breath :)
[03:08:00] <ph88> what about if i put the append inside the loop, would that "break it up"  ?
[03:08:22] <Cork> no it would mean the browser would have to do a full page reflow for each loop
[03:08:29] <Cork> it would slow it down A LOT
[03:08:43] <ph88> oki
[03:08:50] <fulminator> Cork: can you please take a look on what I am trying to achieve?
[03:09:14] <DRSK> sacho: say I've got nav > ul > li x5 where nav has overflow: hidden; would I like to push the <ul> -heightOfItems x5?
[03:10:08] <motaka2> Cork:  $("input,select").css("border", "1px solid #6891c1");  does not remove my red border
[03:10:34] <sacho> DRSK, something like that, yes
[03:10:51] <Cork> motaka2: might be from form validation
[03:11:05] <sacho> be mindful of their borders/margins/paddings as well though
[03:11:35] <motaka2> Cork: It is but when it is valid all fields are but <selects> preserve it's red border
[03:11:58] <DRSK> Thank you sacho for clearing it up for me, I'll try this approach!
[03:13:30] <motaka2> Cork: It is but when it is valid all fields are BLUE BORDERED but <select>s preserve it's red border
[03:16:15] <Cork> ph88: http://jsfiddle.net/eB2fb/2/
[03:16:50] <Cork> alternatively you can add each section as the loop ends
[03:17:43] <Cork> ph88: http://jsfiddle.net/eB2fb/3/
[03:18:57] <fulminator> I have multiple persons (div droppable) and multiple toys (div draggable); if I give to a person a correct toy, moves--, until it reaches to zero. when moves is 0, the game is over. But I do not know how to pass the moves variable. http://jsfiddle.net/fulminator/FqGME/20/
[03:19:46] <Cork> motaka2: either you could disable the html validation, or set its :invalid rule
[03:19:59] <motaka2> Does this $("select").css("border", "1px solid #6891c1");  makes the borders of all selected boxed blue ?
[03:20:02] <Cork> motaka2: if you need more help then that a pb would help
[03:20:26] <Cork> motaka2: unless something is adding a border with !important
[03:21:06] <motaka2> Cork: this one works $("input").css("border", "1px solid #6891c1"); but $("select").css("border", "1px solid #6891c1"); doesn't
[03:21:57] <Cork> motaka2: inspect your css rules
[03:22:05] <Validatorian> Anyone know what's wrong with my CSS/JS here? http://jsfiddle.net/bmE5J/ -- trying to make the image slide out from the left after it's been loaded. It works if the image is already there, but not when injected dynamically.
[03:22:36] <motaka2> Cork: What do you mean ?
[03:22:49] <Cork> motaka2: in the development tools of the browser
[03:23:00] <Cork> inspect what ruls are applied on the element
[03:23:09] <motaka2> ok
[03:23:51] <motaka2> Cork: border: 1px solid red;
[03:24:00] <Cork> ya, but from what rule
[03:24:16] <Cork> and is there an !important there?
[03:25:20] <motaka2> Cork: What do you mean ? when something is wrong i add border css and when user corrects it. i replace it with blue one - this works great for <input>s but not for <select>s
[03:25:41] <Cork> motaka2: do you have the code so you can share it?
[03:26:03] <motaka2> yes
[03:27:45] <motaka2> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/BnybM/
[03:28:15] <Cork> oh, i meant the html + css
[03:29:57] <motaka2> Cork: it is impossible
[03:30:40] <motaka2> Cork: In that code line 4 works but line 5 doesnt work
[03:31:01] <Cork> hmm, do you see the border added to the style for the select?
[03:31:34] <motaka2> Cork: no, it shows me red border
[03:31:45] <Cork> uh, in the style inspector
[03:32:11] <Cork> (you really need to learn how to inspect the applied styles on the elements)
[03:33:32] <motaka2> Cork: I am using firbug and i see <select> has boreder:1px solid red;
[03:33:44] <motaka2> Cork: Is that what you are asking for ?
[03:33:49] <Cork> yes, and no
[03:34:14] <Cork> if you check the css section you should see all the rules that apply on the element (including inline/element)
[03:34:15] <motaka2> Cork: the problem now is I cant select <select>
[03:34:25] <Cork> why not?
[03:34:33] <motaka2> Cork: I dont know
[03:34:45] <motaka2> as i told you it works for inpts
[03:34:50] <Cork> are you sure you arn't replacing it with something js generated?
[03:34:52] <motaka2> but not for select
[03:35:03] <motaka2> Cork: Yes I am sure
[03:35:15] <ph88> Cork:  i did some more testing:   http://jsfiddle.net/eB2fb/4/   -- [12:33:58.698] method A: 15585ms   [12:33:58.740] method B: 42ms   and i removed jQuery each too, as it saved 200ms ...
[03:35:15] <Cork> motaka2: well it works, but your doing something on your page that prevents it
[03:35:21] <Cork> and without seeing it i can't do much
[03:35:39] <motaka2> Cork: lemme see what I can do
[03:36:08] <Cork> ph88: did you see the solution i posted a little bit up?
[03:36:09] <fulminator> ph88: your fiddle stuns my browser

[03:40:13] <Hermiene> I have a <select> with two <option>s, and I'd like to get a hold of which of the two options are currently selected.
[03:40:25] <Hermiene> I tried .val() on the <select>, which didn't work.
[03:40:42] <Hermiene> I.e. $('#select-id').val()
[03:40:48] <Cork> Hermiene: .val() should give you the value of the option
[03:40:58] <Hermiene> Cork: I'm getting undefined
[03:41:09] <Cork> $('#select-id').length ?
[03:41:45] <Hermiene> 1
[03:41:54] <Cork> $('#select-id')[0].nodeName ?
[03:42:07] <Hermiene> But see, it's the <option> which holds the value, not the <select>
[03:42:10] <ph88> Cork:  thx for the effort   , however i keep with the string append   http://jsfiddle.net/eB2fb/5/    [12:40:45.768] method B: 127ms   [12:40:46.198] method C: 430ms
[03:42:19] <Cork> Hermiene: no its not
[03:42:42] <Hermiene> Cork: Well, in the HTML it is
[03:43:03] <Cork> well in html yes, but not in the dom
[03:43:21] <fulminator> can someone please help me with passing the variable moves between functions: elect-id')[0].nodeName ?
[03:43:29] <Hermiene> Cork: Wait, I was too quick; length is 0
[03:43:31] <fulminator> can someone please help me with passing the variable moves between functions: http://jsfiddle.net/fulminator/FqGME/21/
[03:43:52] <Hermiene> Cork: Yeah, that was my reasoning, too. Looking into it, I've probably just made a silly mistake somewhere..
[03:43:55] <Cork> Hermiene: so the selector doesn't match
[03:44:25] <Hermiene> ... I see; it's generated content, and it's not yet added to the DOM. >.<
[03:45:07] <Hermiene> Is it possible to have an event listener?
[03:45:14] <Hermiene> Like, on-value-changed?
[03:46:28] <shomon> hi, I'm replacing values in form elements: if "use email as username" is checked, the email field gets copied to the username field. In theory. In reality though, in firebug nothing happens and "value" doesn't have a value!
[03:46:33] <shomon> am I missing something?
[03:48:56] <shomon> if I replace some element with "myelement.val(secondelement.val())" is some other step needed, or should that already appear in the form when submitted?
[03:50:40] <Hermiene> change() looks like it'll do what I want, but I don't think it works with generated content
[03:59:54] <Cork> shomon: that should be all that's needed
[04:00:20] <shomon> Cork: I figured out here with a colleague that basically "disabled sucks"
[04:00:34] <shomon> you have to use "readonly" or it'll mess up form submissions
[04:00:52] <Cork> well disabled isn't meant to be submitted
[04:01:14] <Cork> it is after all disabled :)
[04:05:52] <shomon> Cork: thanks :)

[04:31:57] <dclaude> cork: calling blur deletes the onblur attribte
[04:40:12] <dclaude> http://jsfiddle.net/wL3Qw/3/
[04:41:09] <dclaude> cork: opening it in IE and switching the document mode to IE7 or IE8 brings up the problem
[04:41:32] <Cork> dclaude: interesting
[04:46:26] <dclaude> yes and i would like to know, why this happens
[04:47:31] <dclaude> if i use i[0].blur() instead, the attribute is not deleted
[04:48:00] <dclaude> so it has to be a jQuery bug/feature
[04:48:04] <Cork> dclaude: same problem with http://jsfiddle.net/wL3Qw/5/?
[04:48:06] <anli__> How can I make jquery validate operate on client side and disable form posting? as it is now, I have to check the model state on server side instead
[04:48:22] <anli__> Make the form post before error checking can be done
[04:48:46] <Cork> dclaude: not guaranteed that there is a bug; jquery has quite a list of compatibility code in for older ie's
[04:48:59] <Cork> and this might be the cost of fixing something
[04:49:16] <Cork> (and this looks like an edge case that could be worth sacrificing
[04:51:13] <motaka2> Cork: are you there ?
[04:54:16] <dclaude> cork: If you like we can call it a compatibility adjustment
[04:54:51] <dclaude> but is there a way to get information about such compatibility adjustments?
[04:55:39] <dclaude> it costs me half a day to find out that this is one
[04:57:07] <dclaude> or do i have to find it out on my own by good unit tests?
[05:00:21] <Lucaszz> Cork: Im doing some ajax requests in the loop
[05:01:04] <Cork> dclaude: each hack is commented in the jquery library and there is bugs in the bug tracker, don't know of anything beside those
[05:01:31] <Cork> Lucaszz: ok?
[05:09:32] <anli__> Are jquery.validate.js and jquery.validate.unobtrusive.js meant to be run in parallel?
[05:20:46] <shoky> anli__ the latter depends on the former, i believe
[05:20:56] <anli__> ok
[05:21:07] <anli__> thx
[05:25:44] <DRSK> How can I find out the "real height" of an element that has its overflow: hidden; ? height(), innerHeight and outerHeight all gives me the same value.
[05:27:41] <fabioportieri> is bad practice to hardcode markup in a js file?

[05:35:10] <NoOova> Hello all!
[05:35:20] <NoOova> How i could know ready status?
[05:36:04] <NoOova> i access widget with ajax. widget has some js code, that must be executed after widget appends to document
[05:36:06] <jugglinmike> NoOova: see the documentation on $.ready: http://api.jquery.com/ready/
[05:36:23] <NoOova> but i dont know, is doc ready or not ready
[05:36:59] <NoOova> no... it is not that
[05:38:00] <NoOova> if i use code in widget without $(function(){.....}) i 100% access widget dom, but does not know, is document ready or is not
[05:38:58] <NoOova> if document is ready, widget could use documents dom but handler added with $(function(){...}) when document is already redy is not executed
[05:39:11] <NoOova> will not be executed*
[05:40:20] <NoOova> Hmmmm... it will be executed?
[05:40:37] <NoOova> >>$(function(){console.log('1');})
[05:40:51] <NoOova> hm... it is not #javascript =)
[05:41:05] <mazzachre> NoOova: If it is critical, make a promise inside your $(function(){}) and use that in your own code...
[05:42:03] <NoOova> it is XY problem =) sorry for bad description
[05:42:44] <NoOova> the ask is very simple, will $(function(){ }) execute handler after document ready event
[05:42:48] <seutje> yes
[05:42:54] <NoOova> thanx =)
[05:43:02] <seutje> I make demo
[05:43:46] <mazzachre> Ya, document ready is also a deferred right?
[05:44:24] <seutje> NoOova: http://jsfiddle.net/CDAWN/
[05:44:53] <seutje> (don't ever do that thoguh, it's silly to bind to doc.rdy when a click is fired)
[05:44:55] <seutje> though
[05:45:03] <NoOova> Thank you_
[05:45:54] <Lucaszz> how to detect end of asynchronious requests loop ?
[05:47:33] <seutje> mazzachre: yeah, so I guess u could just $(function(){}).promise().then(...)
[05:49:32] <seutje> Lucaszz: jQuery.active shows the number of active ajax requests
[05:50:41] <mazzachre> Lucaszz: You can also chain each request into a promise and use .then()
[05:59:16] <Lucaszz> mazzachre: , seutje: http://pastebin.com/6bXv3QWw
[05:59:24] <Lucaszz> could you give me some tips?
[06:04:42] <shoky> Lucaszz: http://pastebin.com/2eMZCqdK
[06:05:31] <seutje> oh, I thought it was a loop like a long-poller that would re-initialize itself when being completed
[06:05:44] <seutje> instead of a bunch of requests simultaneously
[06:12:54] <rufianw> What's the best way of 'switching pages' with jquery-ui? For example, inside a tab I have a login form with a link "Register a new account". When the user clicks the link, I want the login page to go away and the register form to appear.
[06:14:17] <pytony> Hi, I'm trying to prevent a <a> tag from being stylized by jqueryui. But I can't figure out what to do.
[06:14:40] <shoky> rufianw: you want to actually redirect to a new page? or switch to a different tab in the ui-tabs? or hide the tabs and show another element instead? or what..
[06:15:13] <rufianw> shoky: to show a different form. No redirect, no HTTP queries.
[06:15:23] <shoky> what does "show a different form" mean
[06:15:26] <shoky> you are showing tabs
[06:16:16] <shoky> pytony: what do you mean
[06:16:35] <rufianw> shoky: Something like <div id="page1" class="">Hey, I'm the login form! Or you want to <a>register</a>?</div> <div id="page2" class="hidden">Register form here</div>
[06:16:54] <shoky> rufianw: and what's the problem?
[06:16:55] <rufianw> Having that <a/> hiding page1 and showing page2.
[06:17:31] <rufianw> I just want to know if there is a nice way of doing that built in jQuery, instead of hiding and showing everything.
[06:17:50] <shoky> but.. you just said that by "that" you mean hiding and showing everything
[06:18:04] <rufianw> A page transition effect would be nice, btw.
[06:18:09] <shoky> so.. is there a built in way in jquery to hide and show everything, instead of hiding and showing everything? no
[06:18:19] <shoky> you have to decide what you want
[06:19:06] <rufianw> shoky: the hiding and showing was just a primitive way of doing it...
[06:19:22] <rufianw> Let's see this way...
[06:19:42] <rufianw> Can I make an horizontal accordion with invisible buttons?
[06:20:11] <pytony> shoky: when I put a <a> into a tag that is stylized by jquery ui, it is also stylized by jquery ui, which is not what I want.
[06:20:14] * shoky blinks
[06:20:37] <pytony> I just want it to be a <a> not a ui-btn or else
[06:20:50] <shoky> pytony: what are you doing. what does "stylized by jquery ui" mean
[06:21:46] <rufianw> pytony: won't you be doing $("a").button somewhere...?
[06:22:54] <pytony> rufianw, I will check that, I'm new to this project and not really easy with jquery ui
[06:23:04] <rufianw> Me too.
[06:23:15] <rufianw> It's about my first half hour with it.
[06:25:02] <Lucaszz> hmm
[06:26:09] <pytony> However, I think it is due to the fact that this <a> is in a <li ui-btn>
[06:27:18] <pytony> But I don't know if applying the style to child elements is the default of jqueryui or if this is a behavior set by the project I'm working in.
[06:32:09] <Lucaszz> shoky: I have one question also to your tip
[06:32:27] <shoky> Lucaszz: shoot
[06:32:43] <Lucaszz> http://pastebin.com/2eMZCqdK - you showed me how to get data
[06:32:50] <Lucaszz> for ex: data1, data2
[06:32:54] <shoky> yep
[06:33:17] <Lucaszz> data are next and next and next arguments of function
[06:33:26] <Lucaszz> but I want to have data as array ...
[06:33:46] <shoky> you can use the 'arguments' array i suppose
[06:33:59] <shoky> built-in JS arguments array
[06:34:23] <fabioportieri> you can do a serializeArray and then merge
[06:34:32] <shoky> huh?
[06:35:40] <geo> hey guys
[06:35:54] <geo> just a quick question, it's not really about jquery but AJAX calls
[06:36:31] <geo> if a client makes a call to a file on my server, which takes some time to execute stuff on the database, and closes their browser during the work
[06:36:54] <geo> will the work be interrupted? (PHP)
[06:38:11] <Lucaszz> shoky: Hmm I still dont have idea how to get arguments arr
[06:38:21] <Lucaszz> inside when apply
[06:38:25] <pachet> geo: http://php.net/manual/en/function.ignore-user-abort.php
[06:38:29] <pachet> geo: also #php
[06:39:03] <shoky> Lucaszz:  it's called "arguments".  console.log(arguments)
[06:39:10] <pachet> ^
[06:39:17] <shoky> Lucaszz:  https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Reference/Functions_and_function_scope/arguments
[06:39:38] <pachet> Lucaszz: every function has an identifier bound to its variable object named 'arguments' that holds the formal arguments passed in, as a sort-of-array
[06:40:19] <pachet> so even if you only have function foo ( a ) { print(arguments); }, if you did foo(1,2,3) you'd see [1,2,3]
[06:42:41] <Lucaszz> pachet: Amazin...
[06:43:14] <lasha> but they're not ACTUAL arrays, though. remember that.
[06:43:49] <lasha> as in, that "arguments" object doesn't have all the built in methods that a regular array object does.
[06:44:52] <pachet> var resolvedArgs = Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments); //now you have those values as an array :]
[06:45:04] <Ansikt> I'm having trouble manipulating the dom from outside of an iframe
[06:45:08] <Ansikt> it's on the same host
[06:45:08] <rufianw> What have you to do to style a text box in jquery ui?
[06:45:11] <Ansikt> how do I do this?
[06:45:29] <pachet> Ansikt: the sane way?
[06:45:30] <pachet> use messages
[06:45:50] <pachet> and have a listener inside the frame whose dom you want to manipulate listen for those messages, and act accordintly
[06:45:53] <rufianw> Most text boxes of examples are not stylized. i.e. http://jqueryui.com/tooltip/
[06:45:53] <Ansikt> pachet: What do you mean by "messages."
[06:45:58] <pachet> er s/accordintly/accordingly

[06:47:18] <Ansikt> pachet:  Exactly what I was looking for, thanks
[06:47:42] <shoky> rufianw: jquery ui doesn't really have any special styling for textboxes
[06:47:51] <shoky> afaik
[06:48:27] <rufianw> shoky: sure? http://jqueryui.com/dialog/#modal-form
[06:48:35] <rufianw> Click 'Create new user'
[06:48:37] <pachet> Ansikt: yw
[06:49:16] <Chosi> does the accordion (ui) automatically use the next element as title, or does it have to be a <h3> or whatever header?
[06:49:27] <shoky> rufianw: that's CSS. but yeah you can use jquery-ui CSS classes like .ui-corner-all or .ui-widget stuff..
[06:55:20] <shoky> Chosi: by default it looks for elements in the even spots (e.g. 0, 2, 4,..) as headers. see http://api.jqueryui.com/accordion/#option-header
[06:55:51] <Chosi> great, thanks shoky

[07:32:40] <rufianw> Is there an easy way of creating a stylized checkbox that looks like a checkbox in jquery ui?
[07:33:21] <amaroks> rufianw: sure you can
[07:33:27] <rufianw> There are nice toggle buttons in jquery ui, but they aren't intuitive here.
[07:33:36] <rufianw> amaroks: how?
[07:34:37] <amaroks> Just design your checked/unchecked images, hide your real checkboxes, on click events show checked/unchecked images and in the background check/uncheck the real boxes
[07:35:22] <amaroks> rufianw: may sound much work but it isn't really
[07:36:05] <rufianw> amaroks: does jquery ui help me with that at all?

[09:03:41] <webstormer> $('input[value=yes]').prop('checked') is returning true when its FALSE, wtf!
[09:03:53] <dclaude> can somebody explain me, how the attr function in jQuery works?
[09:03:56] <Tisiphone_> Hey, I'm hoping someone could give me a bit of help with preloading large (1500px wide) graphics. I am designing a website that has a scrolling background slideshow with large images. The issue is that when the loads, the images are then rendering.
[09:04:18] <dclaude> i have a curious behavior and i don't know exactly why
[09:04:35] <Andrew_R> webstormer: maybe try $('input[value=yes]').is(':checked')
[09:04:59] <webstormer> Andrew_R: OK I will try, thanks; but is there any explanation
[09:05:21] <dclaude> i set element attributes via field["onblur"]=... and try to get the value afterwards via jQuery("#field1").attr("onblur")
[09:05:33] <Andrew_R> webstormer: I've heard about inconsistencies across browsers doing it the other way
[09:05:40] <dclaude> depending on the used browser, i get very different results
[09:05:52] <PrettyHrs> hi
[09:06:13] <dclaude> the most curious results i get for IE 7 and IE 8
[09:06:27] <PrettyHrs> I need know how set the icon to tag with accordion jquery?
[09:06:27] <dclaude> i have prepared the following example: http://jsfiddle.net/639L6/1/
[09:08:58] <Andrew_R> dclaude: I wouldn't use "onblur" at all. If you're using jQuery, might as well use the .blur() method
[09:10:01] <dclaude> Andrew_R: I use the blur method of jQuery
[09:10:08] <dclaude> and this is my problem
[09:10:35] <Andrew_R> your example isn't using blur()
[09:10:39] <dclaude> because jQuery does something like setting the attribute "onblur" to null and back to the original function
[09:10:45] <dclaude> in the trigger function
[09:12:15] <dclaude> and because of the curious behavior for IE7 and IE8 it means, that jQuery("#field1").attr("onblur") returns undefined, after i have called the blur method of jQuery
[09:13:51] <Andrew_R> jQuery doesn't set the onblur attribute when you use .blur().
[09:14:07] <Andrew_R> if you are using .blur() correctly, you should never have to worry about "onblur"
[09:15:28] <dclaude> jQuery does something like that in the trigger function:
[09:15:30] <dclaude> old = elem[ ontype ];
[09:15:46] <dclaude> 						elem[ ontype ] = null;
[09:15:50] <Mottie> dclaude: I think jQuery triggers an "focusout" event when an element loses focus
[09:15:56] <dclaude> elem[ ontype ] = old;
[09:16:51] <dclaude> Mottie: maybe, but i call the blur method of jQuery explicitly in a unit test
[09:17:07] <dclaude> which calls the trigger method finally
[09:17:35] <dclaude> and at the end of this method the onblur attribute of the element is set to null and back to the original content
[09:18:09] <dclaude> but not using the attr method of jQuery
[09:18:40] <Andrew_R> dclaude: are you looking for $(element).unbind('blur')?
[09:19:12] <dclaude> Andrew_R: no i don't want to unbind anything
[09:19:31] <sacho> dclaude, what version of jquery is this?
[09:19:58] <Andrew_R> ok, I don't know, but my advice to you is if you are using .blur(), don't worry about "onblur" at all
[09:20:14] <Mottie> dclaude: http://jsfiddle.net/Mottie/wDPcG/
[09:20:28] <dclaude> sacho: the problem occurs in Version 1.7.2 and 1.9.1
[09:20:49] <dclaude> Andrew_R: i have to worry about the "onblur" attribute
[09:21:05] <dclaude> because i am writing code to support legacy code
[09:21:23] <dclaude> which means elements using the dom properties
[09:21:32] <dclaude> and i do it test driven
[09:21:40] <sacho> I'm not sure why it's a problem :|
[09:21:58] <dclaude> and in the test i use jQuery to find out, if my code does, what it is intended to do
[09:22:03] <dclaude> and there is the problem
[09:22:29] <dclaude> because jQuery says, there is no longer an attribute "onblur" after calling the blur method of jQuery
[09:23:42] <dclaude> but only for IE7 and IE8
[09:27:49] <dclaude> seems it haven't explained it very well
[09:27:53] <dclaude> :(
[09:28:08] <dclaude> seems i haven't explained it very well
[09:29:19] <sacho> no, I understand
[09:29:23] <sacho> I just can't test it properly
[09:29:46] <dclaude> don't you have IE?
[09:30:37] <sacho> I do
[09:31:01] <sacho> http://jsbin.com/ufepad/1
[09:31:05] <sacho> works fine in ie7 and 8
[09:31:42] <dclaude> have you tried my example?
[09:32:28] <sacho> which example?
[09:32:40] <dclaude> http://jsfiddle.net/639L6/1/
[09:33:09] <sacho> jsfiddle doesn't work on ie7/8
[09:33:21] <dclaude> not very good
[09:34:14] <dclaude> but when you switch to IE8 document mode and have a look at the console, you can see the output
[09:34:35] <dclaude> even if the page doesn't look very nice
[09:37:59] <sacho> you shouldn't be using attr in this case anyway
[09:38:06] <sacho> it's not consistent even in newer browsers
[09:38:19] <sacho> .prop works just fine
[09:39:37] <sacho> but now I'm curious what sorcery jquery uses for .attr
[09:40:22] <dclaude> me too
[09:40:33] <dclaude> but using .prop let my test pass
[09:40:36] <dclaude> :)
[09:40:44] <dclaude> thank you very much
[09:41:01] <happyface> is there an easy way to locate which jQuery UI funtions I use so I can make a custom build?
[09:41:30] <Anickyan> I've seen someone do this:
[09:41:32] <Anickyan> $(this).removeClass("active", 250);
[09:41:37] <Anickyan> What does the 250 do?
[09:43:17] <dclaude> sacho: i still don't know how .attr works, but in the end i don't have to
[09:43:20] <dclaude> :)
[09:43:35] <sacho> dclaude, for example, in chrome, removing the property onblur doesn't change the attribute, so jquery still reports it existing
[09:43:54] <dclaude> yes, the same for FF and IE9
[09:43:56] <prettyHrs> http://jsbin.com/abuqes/1/edit
[09:43:58] <sacho> dclaude, there's a difference between attributes and properties, and newer versions of jquery stopped pretending they were the same thing
[09:44:19] <prettyHrs> I not have idea why it doesn't works
[09:45:13] <shoky> prettyHrs: what doesn't work about it?
[09:45:28] <dclaude> sacho: ok, i will keep in mind to use .prop for such cases in the future
[09:45:44] <prettyHrs> I'm trying to do works the accordion jquery
[09:46:15] <shoky> prettyHrs: it works. if you're expecting to be able to close the single item, you can't. accordions always have exactly one item open
[09:46:48] <dclaude> sacho: i have to leave now, thank you again, i now have a green test :)
[09:49:03] <sacho> dclaude, something to note http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5874652/prop-vs-attr
[09:49:44] <merlinx> How to submit form after event.preventDefault();  ?
[09:49:48] <prettyHrs> And if I just got one element and I wanna collapse it?
[09:51:30] <shoky> prettyHrs: then use something other than jquery-ui accordion
[09:51:34] <merlinx> Any input on this?
[09:51:51] <shoky> merlinx:  formElement.submit()
[09:52:09] <prettyHrs> Accordion jquery doesn't works for me in this example?
[09:52:31] <merlinx> I tried  $('#wp-customer-form').submit();
[09:52:33] <shoky> prettyHrs: it works fine, you cant collapse all elements..
[09:52:35] <merlinx> but does not work
[09:52:55] <prettyHrs> But If I just have one element and I need close it and open it?
[09:52:56] <shoky> merlinx: because you're triggering your own submit handler, maybe?
[09:53:03] <shoky> merlinx: and doing preventDefault() again
[09:53:24] <merlinx> ?
[09:53:26] <merlinx> shoky: what do you mean doing preventDefault()
[09:53:44] <shoky> merlinx: i mean, you're doing preventDefault() for the 2nd submit also..
[09:54:01] <shoky> merlinx: either use a flag inside that says whether to actually submit it or not.. or just do $('#wp-customer-form')[0].submit()
[09:55:57] <merlinx> shoky: This is my code http://pastebin.com/BBfgfNuC
[09:58:16] <shoky> merlinx:  usually you should handle the 'submit' event instead of the 'click' event.. but if you're not handling submit event.. that should work
[09:59:12] <merlinx> shoky: that is my problem this code does not work :(
[09:59:41] <shoky> merlinx: can't help without more info/more code/a demo
[10:00:56] <merlinx> Anyone here knows why the submit or trigger function does not submit the form after n seconds http://pastebin.com/BBfgfNuC ?
[10:02:45] <shoky> merlinx: noone will know, that's just not enough info
[10:07:01] <kingyy> Question about .on() : Where is the list of events that I can bind to this call ?
[10:08:33] <shoky> kingyy: there is no list, you can listen for any event name you want
[10:09:18] <shoky> kingyy: but, check out http://api.jquery.com/category/events/   for some
[10:09:36] <kingyy> Yes, I checked that, but that looks very short list...
[10:09:54] <shoky> there is no list, and there couldn't be one
[10:10:09] <kingyy> What I am trying to do is run the handler when the selector is found in the document now or in future.
[10:10:36] <kingyy> $(document).on("load", "div#id1", handler);
[10:10:38] <shoky> here's another useless list for you  https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/Mozilla_event_reference
[10:11:10] <kingyy> but div#id1 could already be in the document or could be loaded later in AJAX and I would like to handle that...
[10:11:19] <shoky> div's dont have a load event
[10:11:30] <shoky> only images.. and windows/iframes
[10:11:37] <kingyy> ohh... so what event can I use for that
[10:11:45] <sacho> http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-2-Events/events.html#Events-eventgroupings
[10:12:03] <shoky> you can't , not any currently clean cross-browser way
[10:12:46] <kingyy> so basically, I should just use setInterval and parse the document everytime and run the handler ?
[10:12:53] <sacho> no.
[10:12:54] <shoky> no
[10:12:56] <sacho> what are you trying to do?
[10:13:28] <kingyy> OK, I am trying to remove some elements on the webpage (greasemonkey).
[10:13:57] <kingyy> These can be present as the page is loaded or are inserted later using ajax/flash...
[10:16:14] <kingyy> Something like: http://jsfiddle.net/ZFAMq/
[10:16:32] <shoky> kingyy: maybe for a greasemonkey script you could use setTimeout/setInterval ,
[10:16:59] <shoky> or find a non-standard greasemonkey way of doing it, if there is one
[10:17:08] <sacho> huh, flash can modify your html?
[10:18:13] <shoky> can it?
[10:18:25] <kingyy> Not sure...
[10:19:52] <sacho> I suppose you could try overwriting the xhr object so you can fire your handler every time content is loaded
[10:20:18] <kingyy> hmmm interesting idea...
[10:20:41] <sacho> but are you sure you aren't provided with a monitoring api?
[10:22:40] <sacho> kingyy, also see mutation observers
[10:23:11] <sacho> that's probably a much better way to handle things
[10:24:30] <kingyy> but that's html5 only right ?
[10:25:28] <sacho> um, yeah
[10:27:03] <kingyy> the document here is not well formed and definitely not html5. It has to be the crude sledgehammer ways... Thanks for your help folks!
[10:30:15] <sacho> what
[10:30:28] <sacho> all that matters is that your browser supports mutation observers
[10:35:47] <mowol> Hi. I have a select with option values 0 - 7 and another select with values also 0 - 7, based on what is selected in the first one, i want to disable all values in the second that would cause the sum of the values to be over 7. How can i do this switfly? :)
[10:39:29] <shoky> mowol: which part are you having trouble with? what have you tried so far?
[10:40:00] <mowol> shoky the multiple select with the sums
[10:40:16] <mowol> is what i problems figuring out
[10:40:27] <shoky> make a jsfiddle showing what you tried
[10:40:57] <mowol> sure, just a sec
[10:41:15] <ashgotti> Hello all. Anyone around to help a noob with trying to get my form to submit onchange? page is http://oopsc.grassrootonline.com, the form is shown if you click the "OOPS! Locator". http://pastebin.com/9D8tecG0
[10:49:32] <gerep> I'm using trigger('change') but it is not working: https://gist.github.com/gerep/5365564
[10:49:45] <gerep> but when I run the command $('#select_request_time').trigger('change'); on chrome console it works
[10:49:47] <gerep> any ideas?!
[10:50:06] <gerep> those two pieces of code are in the same file, I've separated them to be easier to read
[10:50:12] <mowol> shoky looks like i got something that works actually. .filter was the key: http://jsfiddle.net/nuCzv/
[10:51:39] <Jacta> Have anyone tried with the most of the jquery ui dialog is behind the overlay: http://9l.dk/tmp/1104201319%3A50%3A58.png
[10:51:56] <Jacta> the second I move the box a bit then its all in front :S
[10:52:01] <Jacta> anyone got a clue? :S
[10:52:19] <shoky> mowol: looks good. except better to use .prop('disabled', true/false)
[10:53:27] <Jacta> and its only in IE that I have seen :S
[10:53:29] <shoky> mowol: and also,  var chosen = $('#curiso').val()    is simpler
[10:54:00] <mowol> shoky so: http://jsfiddle.net/nuCzv/1/
[10:54:04] <mowol> why is prop better btw?
[10:54:46] <dzarzagza> for  $(document), what other elements can i manipulate? like window, html, body, div
[10:54:51] <dzarzagza> is there a list somewhere
[10:54:58] <shoky> mowol: because prop is for setting runtime properties. attr is for setting html tag's attributes, which might (or might not) be updated from the properties
[10:55:25] <shoky> dzarzagza: any element, and also many things which aren't elements
[10:55:48] <mowol> shoky great. I didnt even know the command :)
[10:56:09] <yoavz-> Hi guys, I'm currently working on customizing wordpress theme so it'll have fixed height (I want it to scale it down to fit 100% height & 100% width). Example for the page I'm currently trying to mod: http://facebook.yoavz.net/wp/
[10:56:23] <yoavz-> If anyone here can help I'll appreciate it

[10:58:25] <twisted`> Hi, I'm having some trouble with adding an offset to a date object... http://img.itadvice.de/jsproblem_20130411_195712.png sorry for the screenshot but tearing apart that jsfiddle to get another working example was a bit more tedious (and I suspect someone here might just *see* the problem)
[10:58:55] <twisted`> when the offset is set to 30 it somehow jumps as if the offset is 120
[10:59:06] <shoky> dzarzagza: they're not elements you put in your html, but they're still objects in the browser's DOM and can be accessed/manipulated in javascript
[10:59:08] <twisted`> when I don't have offset as a var but simply in code 30 it works
[11:01:05] <dzarzagza> oh i see
[11:03:06] <shoky> twisted`:   parseInt(offset, 10)
[11:03:39] <Jacta> Have anyone tried with the most of the jquery ui dialog is behind the overlay: http://9l.dk/tmp/1104201319%3A50%3A58.png
[11:04:10] <shoky> twisted`: you're adding the string '30' to date.getDate()  which does:  date.setDate(1 + '30')  which sets it to 130
[11:04:23] <twisted`> shoky: yep makes sense :D
[11:04:25] <twisted`> thanks
[11:04:31] <twisted`> I thought it knew it was a number
[11:04:41] <twisted`> fixed it, thanks a bunch!
[11:04:43] <shoky> that's not how javascript works

[11:16:18] <spobat> how can I get the "button .entry" child of a jquery obj?
[11:16:35] <spobat> what I tried: entry.select('button > .room-close');
[11:17:31] <spobat> ah, I think it's `find`
[11:18:56] <spobat> well, "select" is something competely different, I see.
[11:18:59] <spobat> sorry for that ;S
[11:20:00] <walkingeye> it looks like jquery's support for traversing svg elements is a bit odd. element selectors work, class selectors only work in some methods, .find works, .siblings doesn't work, .parent works, .children doesn't work.
[11:20:12] <walkingeye> is svg support missing because it's not going to be added?
[11:20:17] <walkingeye> or because no one has worked on it?
[11:20:37] <walkingeye> i'm happy to submit patches to at least allow svg dom traversal to work correctly

[11:42:34] <shiftins> anyone familiar enough with jquery tools to know if there is a 'destroy' method that resets the data attribute and essentially removes the reference? attempting to call overlay() multiple times without a bunch of hackery to store has an overlay been opened, etc..
[11:47:12] <diverdude> I have a div with divs inside. I have a .click event on the outer div and other click events on the divs inside. The problem is that the outside div click event is fired when i click the inner divs. How can i avoid that?
[11:49:21] <shoky> diverdude: you can do event.stopPropagation()  in the inner clicks. or you can check the target element in the outer click handler
[12:04:32] <Aji-Dahaka> I am trying to use a delegated listener [ $(document).on('click', '#myID', function() { alert('Hey!'); } ] .  It does not seem to be working.  [ $._data($(document)[0], "events"); ] shows the event but [ $._data($('#myID')[0], "events"); ] does not.  Is that an indication that the delegation itself is not working or is that behaviour of $._data expected?
[12:04:43] <Z3R0> O.o
[12:05:35] <Z3R0> what is with the [ ] ?
[12:05:44] <gnarf> Aji-Dahaka: the event is bound on the document
[12:05:55] <gnarf> Z3R0: i think its just his way of saying "this is code"
[12:05:58] <Z3R0> ah
[12:05:58] <Aji-Dahaka> Z3R0: I was just trying te separate the code from the text
[12:06:03] <Z3R0> yea figured afterwards
[12:06:05] <Aji-Dahaka> shorter than <code></code> ;p
[12:06:12] <Z3R0> interesting that the event doesn't fire though
[12:06:15] <Z3R0> I am using it right now lol
[12:06:22] <Z3R0> $(document).on('submit','.ajaxSubmit',function(e) {
[12:07:13] <Aji-Dahaka> yeah, I have it a lot like that.  and when I inspect document's entry using $._data, it shows the event bound to document with the selecter '#myID'
[12:07:16] <gnarf> Aji-Dahaka: $(document)[0] ?? :)
[12:08:00] <Aji-Dahaka> gnarf: if I put just $(document) as an argument, I get undefined
[12:08:04] <Aji-Dahaka> *shrug*
[12:08:07] <gnarf> Aji-Dahaka: document ?
[12:08:13] <gnarf> Aji-Dahaka: :)
[12:08:23] <gnarf> Aji-Dahaka: document === $(document)[0]
[12:08:48] <gnarf> makes sense to jQuery()[0] the selector
[12:08:50] <gnarf> but not with document
[12:08:52] <gnarf> anyway
[12:09:08] <gnarf> the event is bound on document, so you won't see any handlers on #myID
[12:09:42] <Aji-Dahaka> okay.  I wasn't sure if the delegation would tie an event directly to the newly created element
[12:09:56] <gnarf> of course it won't
[12:10:05] <shoky> that wouldn't be delegation
[12:10:07] <gnarf> delegated events listen because events bubble
[12:10:14] <Aji-Dahaka> *nod* gotcha
[12:10:24] <Aji-Dahaka> although they seem not to be currently bubbling :p
[12:10:43] <Z3R0> no console errors? lol
[12:10:50] <Z3R0> maybe you forgot a ) or a ; hehe
[12:11:01] <gnarf> Aji-Dahaka: is some other event handler bound that is stopping prop? and/or see `doesn't work
[12:11:08] <gnarf> `doesn't work
[12:11:13] * gnarf shrugs
[12:11:26] <Aji-Dahaka> no errors.  It must be the OpenLayers map object between the two or something similar
[12:11:30] <Aji-Dahaka> thanks for the help, guys :)
[12:11:59] <gnarf> Aji-Dahaka: chrome debugger can breakpoint on event handlers

[12:16:25] <gnarf> one of his chrome dev tools videos clued me in on that one
[12:16:30] <Z3R0> I kinda miss the live events, or did they get tacked onto the document anyways ?
[12:16:41] <Z3R0> it just seems awkward to make those kind of calls document spec'd
[12:18:07] <shoky> Z3R0 yes they got tacked onto document
[12:18:11] <Z3R0> ah ok then
[12:18:29] <Z3R0> well then it makes sense to use .on()
[12:18:43] <shoky> especially when the docs for .live() say so
[12:18:48] <Z3R0> lolz
[12:18:50] <Z3R0> oops
[12:21:03] <eddiemonge> walkingeye: no. why?
[12:21:29] <eddiemonge> sunbeam: thats how they work. make it a radio choice
[12:22:10] <walkingeye> eddiemonge: I think sizzle is having some problems with selecting svg elements. not sure if this is intentional, or something that I could submit patches / bugs for
[12:22:33] <shoky> walkingeye: http://docs.jquery.com/Won't_Fix#SVG.2FXML.2FVML_Bugs
[12:22:56] <shoky> though bug tracker is down :(
[12:23:01] <walkingeye> ah, thanks! that's exactly what i wanted to find
[12:23:33] <walkingeye> so they're won't fix because no one has time, not because they don't want to support it. perfect :)
[12:50:09] <dallen> Anyone here might be able to tell me what's wrong with my submit function? I have a var ready = 0; so if a field passes validation, I go ready+1. Then if ready = 4, I want to return true. But for some reason, ready never increments. Any ideas why? http://jsfiddle.net/ZGhT6/
[12:52:53] <sacho> dallen, an expression has a value(obtained after evaluating it), and possible side effects. Can you tell me what the value and side effects of ready + 1 are?
[12:53:22] <shoky> :-o
[12:53:35] <sacho> ditto for ready = 4
[12:53:53] <dallen> Basically, I set ready to 0 initially. Then, as each form field is validated, I ready+1. If all fields are validated, ready should equal 4, then I want it to submit.
[12:54:10] <sacho> yes, I already read the code :)
[12:54:37] <shoky> dallen: = and == (and ===) are very different. and doing "ready + 1"  doesn't do anything, as sacho is cryptically trying to tell you
[12:54:55] <dallen> Ah crap.
[12:54:59] * sacho used terminology encryption
[12:55:11] <dallen> Should it be ready++?
[12:55:19] <shoky> that, or?
[12:55:56] <dallen> ++ready?
[12:56:05] <shoky> touche.
[12:56:22] <shoky> (i meant: ready = ready + 1)
[12:56:33] <dallen> Ah, I got you
[12:56:59] <fikst> there is still 1 other method left :)
[12:57:09] <shoky> infinite ways, really ;p
[12:57:12] <sacho> just 1? :)
[12:57:40] <sacho> dallen, also what shoky uncryptically mentioned is that if (ready = 4) probably doesn't do what you think it does
[12:58:16] <shoky> click the JSHint button
[13:00:55] <fikst> syntactically I can only think of 1, but I am always curious for some other methods out of the infinite :)
[13:01:18] <dallen> Thanks shocky
[13:01:24] <dallen> http://jsfiddle.net/donaldallen/ZGhT6/2/
[13:01:26] <dallen> Makes sense now!
[13:02:51] <dallen> Changed ready = ready + 1 to ready++.
[13:03:23] <shoky> bot can have the saved bytes
[13:03:25] <shoky> ?botsnack
[13:03:25] <bot-t> Thank you! OMNOMNOMNOMNOM
[13:03:42] <dallen> Appears they went to a good cause
[13:06:12] <sacho> you should use .prop('checked') instead of .is
[13:07:24] <shoky> what's wrong with :checked?
[13:09:46] <air_> Am I the only one who is annoyed by the fact that jsfiddle uses JSHint instead of JSLint. And then says that JSLint is valid.
[13:09:59] <air_> :)
[13:11:53] <eddiemonge> its just switched
[13:14:16] <sacho> shoky, is :checked a native selector?
[13:15:00] <sacho> or to answer your question, I was under the impression it wasn't
[13:41:28] <puchacz> hi, what library would you recommend to have GUI in the form of interactive graph, like graph of tables in database?
[13:46:56] <eddiemonge> puchacz: dojo, extjs
[13:47:11] <puchacz> something within jquery maybe?
[13:47:29] <puchacz> I do not want to start flame wars, but I did not like extjs.....
[13:48:31] <puchacz> something non-instrusive
[13:48:57] <puchacz> not "move from my way, I will do it for you" style
[13:53:24] <eddiemonge> you asked
[13:54:25] <puchacz> I am googling, maybe this? http://jsplumb.org/jquery/demo.html
[13:55:52] <puchacz> I really want something jquery specific
[13:56:39] <eddiemonge> then what about http://www.datatables.net/ ? ive never used it though
[13:57:29] <puchacz> well. it is not for graphing relationships
[13:57:46] <Foxhoundz> you want a graphing plugin for jQuery?
[13:57:55] <puchacz> yes
[13:58:09] <puchacz> say I want to plot interactive database relationships diagram
[13:58:39] <Foxhoundz> hmm
[13:58:43] <Foxhoundz> I know of a few that can do it
[13:58:50] <Foxhoundz> but they don't utilize jQuery
[13:59:07] <puchacz> as long as they are not intrusive
[13:59:16] <puchacz> I do not like extjs style if you know what I mean
[13:59:37] <Foxhoundz> puchacz: http://jsplumbtoolkit.com/jquery/demo.html
[13:59:40] <puchacz> they take over your entire screen and application workflow
[13:59:46] <Foxhoundz> oh...
[13:59:57] <hugo_moss> how can i retrieve the viewport initial scale using jquery/javascript?
[14:00:26] <puchacz> Foxhoundz: yes, I googled it few minutes ago. Is it any good? on the surface it looks promising
[14:01:44] <madprops> is this the proper way to use the last selector? $('.reply_id:last')
[14:01:51] <madprops> for some reason it's not working
[14:02:59] <eddiemonge> ?last @ madprops
[14:03:00] <bot-t> madprops, .last(): Reduce the set of matched elements to the final one in the set. http://api.jquery.com/last/
[14:03:14] <puchacz> Foxhoundz: do you think I can just say X connects with Y anzd Z etc. and it will all lay it out for me?
[14:03:53] <eddiemonge> ?last-selector @ madprops
[14:03:54] <twisted`> I'm having some issues with the datepicker, I'm not sure if it's pure CSS (afraid not), I made a video to demonstrate the issue: http://img.itadvice.de/Screencast_20130411_210212.mp4

[14:07:57] <andres__> Im wondering if any can tell me why the string variable im passing to the title of my dialog works when i hit the link the second time http://jsfiddle.net/6qgTr/11/
[14:10:17] <sacho> andres__, can you rephrase?
[14:10:55] <seutje> andres__: ur not passing it a second argument the first time
[14:11:05] <seutje> $dialogDiv.load($link.attr('href'), function() { openDialog($dialogDiv); });
[14:11:24] <andres__> seutje: you mean in the onclick event?
[14:11:36] <andres__> seutje: ohhh
[14:11:40] <seutje> so the title argument to the openDialog function will be undefined
[14:13:02] <andres__> so i will have to set a variable with the title and then pass it
[14:13:19] <seutje> also, with ur current implementation, clicking it again before the ajax call has returned will trigger it to open an empty dialog
[14:14:50] <andres__> seutje:  nop.. it opens the same
[14:15:10] <seutje> it doesn't open empty and then the content plops into existence?
[14:15:51] <andres__> seutje:  no.. it opens with the href content inside
[14:16:09] <seutje> odd, because the .data('dialogDiv' call happens before the request has returned
[14:16:58] <princeKat> history.back();
[14:17:38] <princeKat> That line return me until the before page, I need some previous movement
[14:17:51] <princeKat> Some less hard
[14:17:58] <andres__> seutje:  the idea is to stop reopening dialogs everytime the link is being clicked
[14:18:34] <princeKat> The more little movement masde on the page
[14:18:37] <princeKat> made*
[14:24:23] <Krambiorix> how can i when logging out close all child windows?

[14:29:32] <Krambiorix> eddiemonge, window.open
[14:30:06] <eddiemonge> then window.close
[14:30:32] <Krambiorix> eddiemonge, there can be 10 windows open...

[14:38:06] <endra> Is there a recommended tutorial/book for jquery mobile?
[14:38:51] <twisted`> window['var'] I think it was... let me try
[14:38:52] <Remy> twisted:      you mean line    document['foobar'+1]   ?
[14:39:07] <Remy> like*
[14:39:16] <Remy> or window.. yep
[14:39:29] <Remy> window["foobar"+i]
[14:40:49] <twisted`> yep...

[15:02:34] <wrapids> I'm trying to use jquery-periodicalupdater, but I'm running into some problems. The initial request should be made on page ready, which is not when this I'm calling the method. In order for me to get it to actually grab the content when the user requests it, it requires that I set the minTimeout very low, but that causes it to request quite rapidly. The multiplier does not seem to be doing anything whatsoever.

[15:39:12] <diverdude> i want to take a tr from a table (with all its td's), remove it from the table and insert it after the first row (first row contains th). how do i do that?
[15:41:10] <eddiemonge> ?after @ diverdude
[15:41:10] <bot-t1> diverdude, .after(content, [content]): Insert content, specified by the parameter, after each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/after/
[15:41:37] <Onkeltem> When looking at a form object, is there a way to know what submit button was pressed AFTER the form was submitted but BEFORE http request is sent?
[15:42:00] <Onkeltem> and not acting in form submit/button handler :)
[15:42:10] <diverdude> eddiemonge, yeah, i tried  var row=rowIDfield.parent();	    row.remove();	    $('#cartsummarytable:nth-child(2)').after(row); but it dont work :(
[15:42:24] <eddiemonge> you dont need to remove it
[15:42:34] <Onkeltem> In other words, does jQuery provide some additional info on Form object about their state when forms are submitted?
[15:42:37] <eddiemonge> and i dont know what that is
[15:43:06] <eddiemonge> Onkeltem: do you need to know which button submitted the form?
[15:43:09] <diverdude> eddiemonge, ah ok...hmm but still it dont work
[15:43:21] <eddiemonge> diverdude: maybe you should make an example
[15:43:23] <Onkeltem> eddiemonge: yes, I think so.
[15:43:24] <MickRip> Onkeltem: the submit event?
[15:43:47] <eddiemonge> Onkeltem: may i ask for what?
[15:43:59] <MickRip> Onkeltem: you could interview the submit event, and then submit the form manually after you've done what you need to do
[15:44:00] <Onkeltem> MickRip: then I would get the button in the event :)
[15:44:38] <MickRip> Onkeltem: var $form = $("#form-id"); // <--- inside your handler?
[15:44:47] <eddiemonge> often the figured out solution is for the wrong problem. often the problem you think you have is not the right problem
[15:45:22] <MickRip> Onkeltem: or ..$(button).closest('form'); to get the form object that way?
[15:45:27] <sacho>  +-
[15:45:49] <Onkeltem> eddiemonge: of course. I act in a handler which is triggered when for example a form in "overlay" is submitted. But that form has two submit buttons: Save and Cancel. I need to know what button was pressed.
[15:46:08] <Onkeltem> eddiemonge: but this is not the form submit handler :(
[15:46:17] <eddiemonge> Onkeltem: shouldnt cancel not submit the form?
[15:46:22] <Onkeltem> eddiemonge: I just receive form in a parameter
[15:46:24] <eddiemonge> but instead cancel it?
[15:46:36] <eddiemonge> thus only the submit button submits the form?
[15:47:15] <Onkeltem> eddiemonge: yes. From the form point of view, both are submit. But in my UI one is Save and the other is Cancel (where HTTP request is not sent)
[15:47:20] <Remy> it sounds like he has a "cancel" button that's not really a cancel button but he receives the form as a parameter, and he's supposed to detect whether the form was actually submitted or cancelled"
[15:47:31] <Onkeltem> Remy +
[15:47:54] <Remy> so you are trying to determine, from the  SubmitEvent object   which btn was pressed
[15:47:55] <Remy> correc5 ?
[15:47:58] <eddiemonge> so then the problem is that you need to "fix" your cancel button?
[15:48:14] <diverdude> eddiemonge, here is example, not working: http://jsfiddle.net/KuEDg/1/
[15:48:21] <MickRip> Onkeltem: use data attributes in your cancel button?
[15:49:49] <Onkeltem> Remy: unfortunatelly I try to do this having only the form object. And I have no event object. As far as I understood (after talking on #javascript) in "pure" JS/DOM I can't do this, having only form object. I hope it somehow changes it's state, but it doesn't
[15:50:02] <eddiemonge> diverdude: what do you think $('table:nth-child(1)') selects?
[15:50:03] <Onkeltem> So my hope was that jQuery could help here
[15:50:33] <diverdude> eddiemonge, the first child
[15:51:01] <eddiemonge> that selector selects the first child table
[15:51:05] <eddiemonge> not the first child of table
[15:51:10] <Remy> Onkeltem: As far as i know the actual form object doesnt contain that data (JS ot jQuery)
[15:51:15] <eddiemonge> and why not just just :first
[15:51:26] <diverdude> eddiemonge, oh, how do i then do?
[15:51:37] <Onkeltem> Remy: thanks. This is important. Then I should continue my research in other directions
[15:51:58] <Remy> I assume that you dont have access to the code at all then?
[15:52:00] <eddiemonge> diverdude: how would you select it with css?
[15:52:06] <Onkeltem> I'd like to get into submit even handler or pass this info somehow, but I'm very limited to used frameworks
[15:52:19] <Onkeltem> Remy: again, you read thoughts :)
[15:52:24] <Remy> :p
[15:52:38] <diverdude> eddiemonge, i dont know
[15:52:59] <eddiemonge> diverdude: a space
[15:53:28] <Onkeltem> This is intersection of Drupal JS framework, Drupal CTools JS framework, CKEditor, CKeditor Drupal integration module, and jQuery on the top :)
[15:53:50] <Onkeltem> I can edit only CKEditor Drupal thing - integration
[15:54:06] <diverdude> eddiemonge, also, this don work http://jsfiddle.net/KuEDg/2/
[15:54:28] <eddiemonge> diverdude: maybe because its not valid code. JSHint it
[15:54:30] <Remy> :/
[15:54:47] <eddiemonge> diverdude: and again, thats selecting the first child table element
[15:54:56] <eddiemonge> not the first child of a table element
[15:55:09] <diverdude> eddiemonge, can you show me how i should do?
[15:56:01] <eddiemonge> add a space
[15:56:13] <diverdude> eddiemonge, where?
[15:56:21] <eddiemonge> in your selector.
[15:56:34] <eddiemonge> diverdude: you should go through try.jquery.com
[15:57:16] <diverdude> eddiemonge, space makes no difference: http://jsfiddle.net/KuEDg/4/
[15:58:07] <eddiemonge> ?first-child-selector @ diverdude
[15:58:09] <bot-t1> diverdude, :first-child Selector | jQuery API Documentation - Selects all elements that are the first child of their parent. http://api.jquery.com/first-child-selector/
[15:58:27] <eddiemonge> diverdude: but you should really use find and eq
[15:58:42] <diverdude> eddiemonge, why?
[15:59:27] <eddiemonge> because tables have tbody and thead and other stuff besides tr and td
[16:01:43] <diverdude> eddiemonge, , not even this works :( http://jsfiddle.net/KuEDg/5/
[16:02:17] <eddiemonge> works just fine if you include jquery http://jsfiddle.net/KuEDg/6/
[16:18:04] <Bowbles> http://bugs.jquery.com/ down?
[16:29:34] <diverdude> is there a way to fire an event on animation done?

[16:31:50] <dzarzagza> http://www.chanel.com/
[16:38:34] <madprops> is there a way to get the images that are in the viewport only?
[16:38:52] <madprops> like if i have thousands of images but only a couple of them are showing, can i iterate through the ones that are showing?
[16:39:04] <madprops> that would be p cool
[16:43:22] <eddiemonge> thousands of images on a page?

[16:49:52] <Third3ye> I got it of the docus...
[16:50:00] <Third3ye> Perhaps I'm using it wrong...
[16:50:40] <Third3ye> Well I want it to pick the .subMenu in that parent and nowhere else
[16:50:41] <coldhead> this is how i'd do what you're trying to do http://jsfiddle.net/fwqxR/1/
[16:50:48] <twisted`> can I disable the overlay in jQuery's UI?
[16:50:55] <coldhead> but it looks like you're show()ing something and then hide()ing it again right away
[16:51:10] <twisted`> after I closed a window the overlay plops in front of a newly opened dialog
[16:51:30] <Third3ye> That doesn't seem to work..
[16:51:33] <eddiemonge> dont forget #Menu
[16:51:37] <eddiemonge> capital M
[16:51:49] <shoky> twisted`: what overlay? what window? what dialog?
[16:51:59] <Third3ye> The dunce is back!
[16:52:06] <Third3ye> :P
[16:52:09] <twisted`> sorry, when I open a jQuery Dialog it makes this overlay
[16:52:23] <twisted`> which is neat
[16:52:25] <shoky> only if it's modal
[16:52:32] <eddiemonge> Third3ye: this might be better though: http://jsfiddle.net/fwqxR/2/
[16:52:40] <twisted`> -but- when I close the window and launch a new one, the overlay is ON top of the new dialog window
[16:52:47] <Third3ye> Yeah, cause that just showed every .subMenu
[16:53:16] <eddiemonge> twisted`: close what window? examples are helpful
[16:53:18] <shoky> twisted` hmm? what window
[16:53:23] <Third3ye> eddiemonge: I seem to remember some of that... my memory is returning
[16:53:31] <Third3ye> You see, I have... coding amnesia
[16:53:50] <twisted`> I can't link to the example it's behind a login process, testing now without the modal flag
[16:53:51] * Third3ye runs up the keys on an old Harmon
[16:54:27] <twisted`> cool without modal it does work as I want it to
[16:54:28] <shoky> you can always link to jsfiddle
[16:54:28] <twisted`> good
[16:54:54] <twisted`> shoky: I can't get jQuery UI to work in JSfiddle, it's a once in a lifetime thing that I get it to work there

[17:01:33] <JFranks> I have a project where it would be really nice to make instances of the menu targets ie: <a href="#learnmore">Learn More</a> is a menu item, and mid page if the phrase 'Learn More' is found in a <span> it will convert it to a trigger that 'clicks' the menu item. I already have all the menu items getting auto-ids based on HREF.. so id="learnmore-href" and I already have $("span").attr('onClick',
[17:01:33] <JFranks> 'document.getElementById("learnmore-href").click();'); working.. but I need it to use "$this.id" + "-href" dynamically vs. the static text that's there?

[17:08:10] <metateck> did nyromodal not work?
[17:08:24] <shoky> Voting: iframe, maybe
[17:08:28] <Voting> metateck: looks like it would take a while to wrap my head around it.
[17:09:27] <shoky> Voting: er actually i donno how to inject an html string into an iframe
[17:09:40] <Voting> shoky: worth a try
[17:10:02] <Voting> shoky: how do I include an HTML STRING in an iframe?
[17:10:06] <shoky> not if you dont have anything to try ;p
[17:10:18] <shoky> Voting: like i just said, donno :p
[17:10:23] <Voting> shoky: sorry... I missed that!
[17:10:24] <cincyguy5646> alwayslearning use $("a.classname").on("click",function(event){ event.preventDefault() } );
[17:11:00] <alwayslearning> cincy what if the individual anchor im targeting doesnt have a class?
[17:11:37] <cincyguy5646> give it one or use it's parent() and traverse
[17:11:37] <rakl> hey, can someone tell me why this #each works in chrome, but not in firefox? http://pastie.org/7459239
[17:11:44] <alwayslearning> i need to target it like .product a:first-of-type
[17:12:17] <cincyguy5646> when you say first of type you mean $("a:first") ?
[17:12:34] <alwayslearning> i mean first a under the .product class
[17:12:59] <cincyguy5646> $(".product").find("a:first");
[17:13:31] <shoky> rakl: outcome of doing $(data) on a full html string is highly browser-dependant.. you can try $.parseHTML(data)  but i doubt that'd make a difference. also, wtf is .pushObject()
[17:13:45] <cincyguy5646> sooo... all together it would be $(".product").on("click","a:first",function(e){}
[17:13:50] <rakl> shoky this is in the context of an ember app, dont' worry about that part :p
[17:14:00] <cincyguy5646> sooo... all together it would be $(".product").on("click","a:first",function(e){ e.preventDefault(); });
[17:14:07] <JFranks> Ahhh...'document.getElementById(this.id+"-href").click();'
[17:14:07] <alwayslearning> thanks cincy, that looks right
[17:14:10] <someprimetime1> shoky: when you create a bunch of $('<p />') tags and want to re-use them how do you handle that?
[17:14:14] <rakl> shoky how can I just loop over the data returning from that url then?
[17:14:29] <cincyguy5646> no prob use the second one i hit enter accidently
[17:14:29] <shoky> rakl: the data is a string. .you dont loop over a string
[17:14:29] <someprimetime1> e.g. var $pTop = $('<p />').addClass('top'); $pbottom = $('<p />').addClass('bottom');
[17:14:39] <shoky> rakl: and jquery is not an HTML parser
[17:14:56] <rakl> the data is an array
[17:15:08] <shoky> rakl: it is? oh.
[17:15:14] <rakl> https://api.github.com/repos/collegedesis/collegedesis.com/issues?labels=feature
[17:15:16] <rakl> yes
[17:15:24] <shoky> rakl: ok sorry, totally misunderstood
[17:16:36] <cincyguy5646> rak1 can you explain the issue again i might be able to help
[17:17:06] <shoky> rakl:  you can't do that "return content" and expect it to work. ajax is asynchronous. by the time the ajax callback is called, the "return content" was already executed long before
[17:17:16] <shoky> ?async101
[17:17:19] <bot-t1> shoky, Couldn't find "async101" in jQuery Docs.
[17:17:24] <shoky> er
[17:17:30] <shoky> ?ajax101
[17:17:30] <b-ot> shoky: Please reference the AJAX 101 diagram: http://oi41.tinypic.com/etsbyo.jpgÂ and these slides: http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide41
[17:17:30] <rakl> shoky returns fine in chrome. Ember is handling the async stuff
[17:17:30] <bot-t1> Please reference the AJAX 101 diagram: http://i41.tinypic.com/etsbyo.png and these slides: http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide41
[17:17:50] <rakl> firefox is blowing up on looping over it
[17:18:13] <shoky> rakl: your code doesnt make any sense..
[17:18:28] <rakl> lol, never mind. maybe wrong channel to ask. i'll try emberjs
[17:18:46] <shoky> rakl:  returning something inside the .each  doesn't do anything (unless you return false)
[17:19:03] <shoky> rakl: then, returning something from inside the $.get  also doesn't do anything
[17:19:23] <someprimetime1> shoky++
[17:19:31] <rakl> hmm, not sure why my coffee script is compiling like that actually. i'm not returning until the last line
[17:19:42] <shoky> ah coffee script.. explains all the returns
[17:19:59] <rakl> but again, i don't think any of these are the real issue
[17:21:09] <Third3ye> Does Jquery support outlining text out-of-the-box?
[17:21:44] <shoky> someprimetime1:  i dont understand your question.
[17:22:15] <someprimetime1> shoky: i want to create a var that is an html element e.g. paragraph tag but I want to create it once and re-use it
[17:22:29] <shoky> someprimetime1:  var p = $('<p>');
[17:22:29] <someprimetime1> for some reason I can't just copy the variable and re-use it
[17:22:36] <shoky> what do you mean by re-use
[17:22:40] <cincyguy5646> its called clone()
[17:22:45] <someprimetime1> cincyguy5646: no it's not
[17:22:55] <someprimetime1> this is before dom insertion
[17:23:04] <shoky> $('<p>')  refers to a single <p> element. if you append it somewhere, it's still referring to that same <p> element (which is now appended)
[17:23:50] <mmlac> How do I select a radio button that is checked?  I tried $("input[checked]") but that fails and only loads the button I marked up as checked="checked" to set the default
[17:23:51] <shoky> someprimetime1: i suspect you want .clone() too
[17:23:57] <cincyguy5646> http://lmgtfy.com/?q=jQuery+clone()
[17:24:20] <shoky> mmlac  $('input:checked')
[17:24:26] <cincyguy5646> someprimetime1 if they reworded the definition on jQuery site for clone() to your question noone would argue it
[17:25:19] <someprimetime1> cincyguy5646: http://jsfiddle.net/DMGaQ/
[17:25:22] <mmlac> aaaah, thanks so much shoky !
[17:25:47] <someprimetime1> cincyguy5646: ah ok thanks
[17:25:48] <shoky> someprimetime1: that doesn't make any sense
[17:25:56] <someprimetime1> shoky: what doesn't?
[17:26:00] <shoky> someprimetime1 your fiddle
[17:26:06] <cincyguy5646> wtf, do you understand what a circular reference is?
[17:26:22] <cincyguy5646> i'm going to smoke a blunt after that one
[17:27:19] <shoky> someprimetime1: see http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/DMGaQ/1/
[17:27:25] <shoky> only one <p>
[17:27:42] <shoky> someprimetime1: if you use .clone()  .. http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/DMGaQ/2/
[17:28:29] <cincyguy5646> ty for letting me skip that fiddle shoky
[17:28:31] <shoky> also.. don't append <p>'s to <html>
[17:28:36] <shoky> poor <body>
[17:29:09] <cincyguy5646> yeah basically you made p tag look like an server side include lol
[17:29:31] <rakl> shoky so, you're kind of right. I noticed that in FF, the data returning from that url is a string. loging data.constructor in FF returns String and Array in chrome
[17:29:37] <rakl> I hadn't cross checked that
[17:29:39] <rakl> weird
[17:30:16] <shoky> rakl: that's weird indeed. me suspects emberjs is playing some games ;p
[17:30:21] <someprimetime1> nah
[17:30:31] <someprimetime1> i should have just done this: http://jsfiddle.net/DMGaQ/3/
[17:30:40] <rakl> shoky no, i'm just logging the data from the  $.get()
[17:30:45] <rakl> nothing to do with ember
[17:31:29] <shoky> rakl: oks, thought maybe it hooks into the ajax calls or someshit
[17:32:55] <rakl> shoky nah, try this in FF and Chrome http://pastebin.com/D9jJp1Dy
[17:34:23] <shoky> rakl: try getJSON  or $.ajax with dataType: 'json'
[17:34:44] <rakl> ah good idea.
[17:35:14] <rakl> shoky getJSON works
[17:35:14] <rakl> woot

[18:26:28] <llll> how can i fetch only the body from a html string?
[18:26:53] <llll> $("<html><body>hello world</body></html>")
[18:27:15] <mfranz> Hi all: I am having some weird behavior with a form... I am using $().serialize(); and returning the form object, however since the <select> value has a space it is cutting off the object see here: http://jsfiddle.net/3RLDa/3/
[18:27:23] <mfranz> do I just need to put the object name in quotes?
[18:27:37] <cincyguy5646> $("body").text();
[18:27:44] <cincyguy5646> you want the words or just the object?
[18:28:25] <llll> cincyguy5646: i want whatever is inside body so i can append it to the dom
[18:28:34] <llll> children() ?
[18:28:46] <coldhead> i don't think it can be done, llll
[18:28:57] <coldhead> because you already have an <html> and a <body>
[18:29:04] <coldhead> so it seems to get gomfuse
[18:29:11] <cincyguy5646> $("body").html();
[18:29:25] <mfranz> the quotes don't work...
[18:29:34] <coldhead> that's using a selector, not a string of html, cincyguy5646
[18:30:02] <llll> any idea?
[18:30:05] <coldhead> $('<html><body>machines talking to me on the phone</body></html>').find('body') === null
[18:30:17] <cincyguy5646> i already said .text() but apparently that's not what he wanted
[18:30:55] <coldhead> llll: i remember there being An Issue with doing what you're trying to do but i don't remember the details
[18:30:55] <llll> has to be a way since jquerymobile is fetching html pages from the server but appends only the body into the DOM
[18:31:03] <coldhead> i think it was a "won't fix" kind of thing
[18:31:12] <coldhead> snover: do you remember?
[18:31:20] <snover> uh
[18:31:21] <snover> what?
[18:31:23] <coldhead> $('<html><body>machines talking to me on the phone</body></html>').find('body')
[18:31:27] <coldhead> how do make shit like that work
[18:31:30] <snover> you donâ€™t
[18:31:47] <coldhead> that's the kind of blunt expertise i was after

[18:32:47] <eddiemonge> document.body
[18:33:23] <llll> don't get it .. is there a solution?
[18:33:59] <eddiemonge> there is always a solution
[18:34:13] <coldhead> sometimes the solution is to transition careers into landscape gardening
[18:34:30] <eddiemonge> not culinary appreciation?
[18:35:58] <snover> the string is turned into a dom by injection to a dom element in an existing document. you cannot have more than one <html> or <body> per document, so the browser deletes those elements.
[18:36:01] <llll> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2857126/how-get-body-element-from-the-html-which-one-have-as-a-string
[18:36:03] <snover> the end.
[18:37:08] <mfranz> If I am using .serialize(); and one of the values has a space the data is truncated at the space I have tried "" the data but that doesn't help any ideas?
[18:37:26] <eddiemonge> ?serialize
[18:37:27] <bot-t1> .serialize(): Encode a set of form elements as a string for submission. http://api.jquery.com/serialize/
[18:37:35] <mfranz> see here: http://jsfiddle.net/3RLDa/4/
[18:38:04] <mfranz> That is what I am doing, however if the select element value has a space the string returned stops at the space
[18:38:14] <eddiemonge> mfranz: those values are wrong
[18:38:23] <mfranz> eddiemonge how is that
[18:38:23] <eddiemonge> wrap the value in "
[18:38:35] <mfranz> Oh
[18:38:40] <eddiemonge> option value=Total Shoulder
[18:38:41] <mfranz> shit, i tested the "" in the wrong place
[18:38:50] <eddiemonge> means option with value=total and some random Shoulder attribute
[18:38:57] <mfranz> haha LOL
[18:38:58] <mfranz> yep
[18:39:07] <mfranz> man I have looked at this for like 30 minutes :(

[18:39:50] <eddiemonge> llll: how are you getting the html as a string?
[18:40:04] <coldhead> llll: you could maybe put that into an iframe?
[18:40:53] <eddiemonge> altin: document ready in window onload? interesting
[18:42:00] <altin> eddiemonge: I am not using document ready
[18:42:22] <altin> I was having problems with is so I switched on using window.onload
[18:42:30] <eddiemonge> altin: oh you arent? so $(function() {}) isnt an alias for it?
[18:43:27] <eddiemonge> ?ready
[18:43:27] <b-ot> eddiemonge: called as soon as the DOM tree is parsed.
[18:43:35] <eddiemonge> ?.ready()
[18:43:49] <altin> eddiemonge: hmm yes :$ well, that's not the problem
[18:44:40] <eddiemonge> never said it was. just was saying its interesting
[18:45:00] <coldhead> ?interesting
[18:45:09] <coldhead> hey fatguylaughing
[18:45:15] <bot-t> Hmm, very interesting https://i.chzbgr.com/maxW500/6972452864/h754A9258/.gif
[18:46:25] <fatguylaughing> coldhead: hello
[18:46:59] <eddiemonge> altin: can you make an actual example?
[18:47:21] <eddiemonge> lol coldhead  i thought you meant the gif was a fat guy laughing
[18:49:34] <coldhead> wooden noootes
[18:50:42] <walkingeye> I see bugs.jquery.com is still down :\
[18:50:47] <cl0udc0ntr0l> :quit
[18:51:26] <walkingeye> any word on what's wrong with it?
[18:52:51] <eddiemonge> its taking a nap
[18:53:51] <walkingeye> I supposed everyone needs a good nap every now and again
[18:54:34] <eddiemonge> gnarf: ideas?
[19:04:48] <mfranz> Ok So I fixed the quotes
[19:04:59] <mfranz> However now where there are spaces .serialize inserts a +
[19:06:00] <shoky> as it should
[19:06:08] <mfranz> http://jsfiddle.net/3RLDa/5/
[19:06:31] <mfranz> shoky: so then I need to do the .replace and regex the + signs?
[19:07:13] <shoky> mfranz: i dont know what you want to do. if you want to submit a form with the serialized data, then you want to leave it as it is (with the + signs)
[19:07:33] <mfranz> Here is the issue
[19:08:10] <mfranz> the string form data looks like this after serialize: &surgical_procedure=Lap+Appy
[19:08:25] <mfranz> that is sent to ajax which sends it to php
[19:08:37] <mfranz> the php has a $_REQUEST['surgical_procedure'];
[19:08:40] <mfranz> that picks up the +
[19:08:57] <shoky> i dont know php, dont know what $_REQUEST is
[19:09:03] <shoky> why not $_GET or $_POST ?
[19:09:08] <mfranz> request is both get and post
[19:09:13] <coldhead> i like the bit about surgery
[19:09:14] <mfranz> it is nice for debugging
[19:09:36] <mfranz> so the $_GET var now has a + instead of the string with a  space in it
[19:09:41] <mfranz> I guess I can go regex that in php
[19:09:48] <shoky> mfranz: using the + is the standard way for sending spaces in standard form data
[19:09:49] <mfranz> I assumed there was a cleaner way however
[19:09:58] <shoky> mfranz: php should change it back to a space
[19:10:03] <shoky> automatically..
[19:10:26] <shoky> if you send the serialized string as data, that is
[19:10:50] <mfranz> let me check that...
[19:13:07] <nitrix> There's multiple encoding.
[19:13:19] <nitrix> The most popular being multipart/form-data.
[19:13:26] <nitrix> So you can read on that.
[19:13:40] <dwarder> http://jsfiddle.net/5FEKs/ why it doesn't load my ajax?
[19:15:28] <shoky> dwarder: /echo/jsonp/ on jsfiddle needs a POST request. and its not on jsfiddle.net
[19:16:00] <shoky> XMLHttpRequest cannot load http://jsfiddle.net/echo/jsonp/?blah=blah. Origin http://fiddle.jshell.net is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Origin.
[19:16:11] <dwarder> hmm
[19:16:11] <Forbidd3n> There are many star rating systems out there. Anyone that can suggest a really good one with 1/2 stars, please?
[19:16:17] <monk3y> dwarder: and also a tiny thing; your <a> elt's closing tag has a typo - "<a/>"
[19:17:34] <dwarder> shoky: does jsfiddle has a way to demo ajax requests from it's own domain?
[19:18:43] <shoky> dwarder: yes, but the domain for the fiddles is not jsfiddle.net  it's fiddle.jshell.net
[19:19:12] <shoky> dwarder: another problem with your fiddle is that your popup has no "content" class. here's a "working" fiddle -
[19:19:17] <shoky> dwarder: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/5FEKs/2/
[19:19:31] <shoky> the {}  is the content from /echo/json
[19:20:06] <dwarder> anks
[19:20:08] <dwarder> oops
[19:20:15] <dwarder> shoky: i see, thank you
[19:21:10] <sheilablackrose> hi guys anyone know a workaround for z-index for ipad?
[19:26:29] <dwarder> shoky: i wonder why i don't see a GET request to /echo/json in my firebug plugin
[19:26:44] <dwarder> shoky: upon "pop it up" click
[19:27:40] <eddiemonge> sheilablackrose: what do you mean?
[19:34:23] <coldhead> bad vibes in the old dimension
[19:36:20] <Third3ye> So I'm trying to make this menu link to show a submenu on hover but since it reacts upon a class rather than any other menu link than the one that's already hovered the submenu disapears...

[19:36:35] <wer0ckz> hi guys. help please - http://jsfiddle.net/fvWND/ - 'clear' is not clearing the textbox.
[19:38:51] <tw2113> wer0ckz, http://jsfiddle.net/fvWND/1/
[19:39:30] <Third3ye> tw2113: it does here
[19:40:03] <wer0ckz> thank you tw2113
[19:40:12] <Third3ye> Ah ^^;
[19:40:26] <Third3ye> tw2113: mind checking out my fiddle?
[19:42:21] <eddiemonge> Third3ye: why arent you doing this in pure css?
[19:42:30] <Third3ye> Good question...
[19:42:38] <scar> anyone know a good way to learn how to convert smil files to m3u8 for use with jwplayer?
[19:43:43] <Third3ye> eddiemonge: I don't know how?
[19:43:57] <Third3ye> eddiemonge: most solutions use JS anyways?
[19:43:57] <eddiemonge> thats not an answer
[19:43:58] <Third3ye> *shrugs*
[19:44:09] <eddiemonge> no, most dont
[19:45:28] <Third3ye> eddiemonge: A quick google'll do ya...
[19:47:16] <tw2113> pure css dropdowns are easy
[19:48:02] <jtm> I have 2 .js files. I am trying to call a function from one file that is in another. The function is being called within an ajax call. It keeps saying the function is not defined.
[19:48:10] <jtm> I have the include order correct
[19:48:43] <eddiemonge> Third3ye: http://jsbin.com/isavim/1/ then you can just add css animations
[19:49:12] <eddiemonge> jtm: is the second script being loaded in an ajax call from the first?
[19:50:24] <jtm> no
[19:50:28] <jtm> They are both included
[19:50:55] <jtm> First inclusion is the one with a function. The second inclusion (below it) is the one that has an ajax call which tries to call the function in the first one.
[19:51:50] <eddiemonge> jtm: example would be nice
[19:52:17] <jtm> don't have :(
[19:52:20] <Third3ye> eddiemonge: thanks, but you were right - a simple CSS solution was enough
[19:52:38] <eddiemonge> jtm: ok then good luck with that
[19:55:11] <wer0ckz> hi. is there a built in jquery plugin to copy text from textarea?
[19:55:47] <coldhead> if t'were built in t'would not be a plugin, non?
[19:56:00] <coldhead> anyway there is nothing in vanilla jQ for that
[19:56:12] <wer0ckz> i see
[19:56:14] <coldhead> http://www.steamdev.com/zclip/
[19:56:18] <coldhead> popular option ^
[19:56:24] <wer0ckz> thanks
[19:56:44] <coldhead> enjoy!
[19:57:20] <eddiemonge> wer0ckz: what do you mean by copy? copy to the clipboard? copy to somewhere else?

[20:04:01] <eddiemonge> boze: try.jquery.com

[20:04:53] <boze> tyvm!
[20:05:06] <otters> with the jquery UI draggable plugin, can arbitrary elements receive drag events?
[20:05:51] <otters> oh, droppable
[20:09:00] <Third3ye> Ok, here's some more of my "OMG, what are you doing?!" code
[20:09:03] <Third3ye> http://jsfiddle.net/F9Tcj/
[20:09:30] <Third3ye> I want to generalise the JQuery function so that it works if I add more menu items or submenu items... but how to go around it
[20:14:58] <Third3ye> I thought perhaps using "ul[id^=livestream]" but that would be the exact opposite of my buglum bear...
[20:24:40] <dwarder> i have a script that uses load http://api.jquery.com/load/ this script is here http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/5FEKs/2/ on my domain i have this script working with a simple content i.e. text and tags, and it doesn't work with a certain page which contains <script> tags <form> and the script doesn't load contents from this page, i was wondering what could prevent .load() function from loading content. i.e. inserting it into container
[20:25:26] <dwarder> does .load() function has certain limits i am not aware of?
[20:25:54] <Andrew_R> Third3ye: use a delegate to set up the event, and put your elements to hide or show in data- attributes on the <a> tags
[20:26:50] <dwarder> hmm looks like it doesnt' like <script> tags
[20:26:52] <dwarder> why?
[20:27:15] <dwarder> is it possible to make it work
[20:28:07] <Andrew_R> Third3ye: since all your submenus have .main_menu_sub, just hide that instead of the more specific class
[20:29:44] <Andrew_R> Third3ye: http://jsfiddle.net/F9Tcj/1/
[20:30:56] <dwarder> is it possible to load <script>my js here</script> with .load() ?
[20:30:58] <Andrew_R> dwarder: use $.ajax instead of load
[20:31:16] <Third3ye> Well golly, mr Andrew_R :) You make it seem so simple ^^;
[20:31:28] <Andrew_R> :)
[20:31:34] <ranzu> hello, Is there anyway for me to append an existing script?
[20:31:44] <dwarder> Andrew_R: i'm using this script http://dinbror.dk/blog/bPopup/
[20:31:53] <dwarder> Andrew_R: i don't think it allowes me to
[20:32:06] <ranzu> There's something I'd like to add but it doesn't kick in if I place the tag in the body,
[20:32:12] <dwarder> Andrew_R: here are ajax examples http://dinbror.dk/bpopup/
[20:32:51] <dzarzagza> whats wrong with my code? i want it so that if i press down or up, the page goes to the bottom or up http://jsfiddle.net/bwxQG/3/
[20:32:59] <dzarzagza> it works for down, but not up
[20:34:03] <Andrew_R> dwarder: ok I'm looking at the bpopup site now
[20:34:24] <Third3ye> Andrew_R: There's a problem on my side which doesn't seem to show up in JSFiddle...
[20:34:48] <Third3ye> nvm, I said that before I reviewed all the code...
[20:38:31] <Andrew_R> dwarder: I guess that jQuery.load() SHOULD execute scripts, but there are a couple exceptions
[20:39:10] <dwarder> Andrew_R: like.. no  $(function() {}         functions ?
[20:39:26] <Andrew_R> if your URL is something like "/ajax/myurl #mycontent" it will only load whatever is in #mycontent, and this will strip the <script> tags
[20:39:34] <Andrew_R> the other thing to look out for is external URL's
[20:39:52] <dwarder> Andrew_R: I need my <script> tags
[20:39:53] <Andrew_R> those wont work because of cross-domain browser restrictions
[20:40:03] <dwarder> Andrew_R: everything is on one domain
[20:40:16] <dwarder> Andrew_R: i remove my <script> tags and it load contens
[20:40:31] <dwarder> Andrew_R: put it back and i have nothing loading
[20:40:49] <Andrew_R> can you hit the url directly?
[20:40:59] <dwarder> yes
[20:41:03] <Andrew_R> and does it work with the script tags in it then?
[20:41:10] <dwarder> yes
[20:41:21] <dwarder> i mean
[20:41:31] <dwarder> not realy
[20:41:45] <dwarder> it uses jquery and stufff from the headers
[20:41:52] <dwarder> witch is not on that page
[20:42:03] <dwarder> it is on the loading page
[20:42:14] <Andrew_R> Right, but the page loads and would work if the libraries were there...
[20:42:16] <dwarder> where this page should be included (loaded with .load)
[20:42:26] <dwarder> yes
[20:42:57] <dwarder> Andrew_R: just by adding <script></script> prevents .load from working
[20:44:41] <Andrew_R> I would have expected the page to actually show even if the scripts don't run
[20:46:04] <dwarder> Andrew_R: this statement is wrong : just by adding <script></script> prevents .load from  working
[20:46:45] <dwarder> Andrew_R: $('#datepicker').datepicker();
[20:46:58] <dwarder> Andrew_R: this is what i have inside <script> tags
[20:47:15] <dwarder> Andrew_R: and this prevents content from loading
[20:47:48] <Andrew_R> are you getting any errors in the console?
[20:53:06] <zizzl> Can someone recommend a good crossbrowser html5 Placeholder plugin? one that works with ie8
[20:55:15] <coldhead> https://github.com/mathiasbynens/jquery-placeholder
[20:56:26] <dwarder> Andrew_R: is there just a way to substitute .load to .ajax for this script?
[20:57:55] <coldhead> i can hear the spanish screams of girlfriends in the other rooms who are not like me
[20:58:17] <Andrew_R> dwarder: you'd have to modify the script
[20:58:44] <dwarder> Andrew_R: i wonder why he used this isntead of ajax, and gave no option
[20:59:30] <Andrew_R> I don't know, file a bug? Include details about how script code from the .load() call isn't being executed.
[21:04:25] <domo> should this work? http://jsfiddle.net/MhWHr/
[21:10:55] <Andrew_R> domo: no, why wouldn't you just do $('#q').val($('#q').val() + 'H'); ?
[21:11:29] <Andrew_R> domo: (Also you don't need to add the $(document).ready(function) to jsfiddle if the "onLoad" dropdown is selected)
[21:11:50] <domo> Andrew_R: I want to send the keystrokes as an event
[21:11:58] <domo> there is a listener listening for them
[21:14:22] <dwarder> Andrew_R: so, it was an error in that script (which is loaded by .load) so everything is cool
[21:14:39] <dwarder> Andrew_R: i guess i just tired a bit to think clear
[21:14:43] <dwarder> Andrew_R: thank you
[21:15:18] <innociv> Uh so
[21:15:40] <innociv> I'm trying to google and find a thing that shows like the progress you're at with pages, like those surveys. No idea what those are called.
[21:15:51] <jtm> How would I detect for IE 8 cleanly with jQuery?
[21:15:56] <innociv> Or hell, just scrolling page ui
[21:16:05] <innociv> Like a horizontal accordian
[21:19:00] <Andrew_R> jtm: what version of jquery?
[21:19:41] <jtm> newest
[21:19:46] <jtm> Well
[21:19:50] <jtm> Not newest, but 1.9
[21:20:01] <jtm> When it was deprecated to be able to check
[21:20:42] <Andrew_R> there is a "jQuery migrate plugin" that adds $.browser back
[21:20:55] <Andrew_R> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-migrate
[21:21:52] <jtm> Eh you think just trying "try / catch" is good enough?
[21:22:12] <Andrew_R> if you can though, you should try to use $.support instead of $.browser
[21:22:17] <Andrew_R> I don't know what you are trying to do
[21:22:19] <jtm> Because it's IE8 causing errors with html5 audio tag and I just don't want to run that audio tag
[21:22:48] <jtm> I guess I'll use !$.support.leadingWhitespace
[21:23:08] <coldhead> neat

[22:22:13] <Third3ye> How do I add sliding effects when CSS display:none; is changed to display:block;? The displaying and hiding is done entirely in CSS... I just want to add some JQuery magic to it
[22:22:57] <Cork> Third3ye: .show(300) ?
[22:23:22] <Cork> or slideDown

[22:25:03] <ionico> hi, how can i set the input value by its name,  when its inside a div with id, i have tried this but doesnt work,  also the div name is from a var: $("#"+div_id+":input[name='comentarios']").val('Work!');  this doesnt work
[22:25:36] <Third3ye> Cork: but wouldn't that mean that JQuery would be dowing the hiding and showing? the CSS already does that...
[22:25:45] <Cork> ionico: so comentarios is a variable
[22:25:47] <Cork> ?
[22:26:17] <ionico> no, comentarios is the name of the input
[22:26:25] <Cork> Third3ye: ah, js can't really handle animating display: none to display: block
[22:26:29] <ionico> div_id is the variable
[22:26:36] <Cork> inimino: so you need a space
[22:26:43] <Cork> and remove the colon
[22:27:12] <Cork> Third3ye: you could try having a look at transition, though it's not exactly cross browser
[22:27:49] <ionico> $("#"+div_id+" input[name='comentarios']").val('Work!');
[22:27:52] <ionico> like this?
[22:27:59] <Cork> yes
[22:28:03] <ionico> ok, letme try
[22:28:37] <Cork> (though i would prob be a bit more consistent with quotes, but it's not that important)
[22:29:19] <ionico> awesome, it works! thanks Cork!
[22:29:22] <Third3ye> Cork: hmm.. then screw it, it was just for eyecandy anyways

[22:31:40] <jacta> have anyone tried where the jquery dialog spawns behind overlay, except inputfield and top are not?
[22:31:48] <jacta> I can show image if it is
[22:32:11] <Cork> uh, tried?
[22:32:20] <Cork> is this a behavior you're looking for?
[22:33:46] <jacta> No, its a !"bug" :)
[22:34:18] <jacta> I dont seems to get why it happens :S
[22:34:18] <Cork> check what z-index the different element has
[22:35:57] <dzarzagza> im trying to get my box to move up or down with arrow keys http://jsfiddle.net/bwxQG/3/ it gets stuck when its up
[22:36:07] <jacta> Cork, http://9l.dk/tmp/1104201319%3A50%3A58.png - only in IE - if I move the box a bit, then its normal "again"
[22:36:32] <dzarzagza> http://jsfiddle.net/bwxQG/4/ this one
[22:38:30] <Cork> dzarzagza: for one you need to block handling more events when the animation is active
[22:38:42] <Cork> as it will queue a huge list of animations
[22:39:06] <Cork> ah
[22:39:44] <Cork> jacta: zoom: 1; on the div for the dialog (or the overlay depending on where you get the problem)
[22:40:01] <Cork> its ie's old hasLayout problem
[22:41:18] <jacta> Cork, tried with <div id="TipFriendDialog" style="display:none;zoom: 1;"> - no luck :S
[22:41:26] <thinkerweb> anyone get IE 10, to see if my site loads?
[22:45:10] <Cork> dzarzagza: http://jsfiddle.net/bwxQG/5/
[22:45:11] <Cork> check the console
[22:45:32] <jacta> Cork, got an idea for it?
[22:46:16] <Cork> jacta: try setting zoom:1; on the overlay
[22:47:41] <jacta> Cork, still no luck :\ its like on the image
[22:48:01] <Cork> jacta: btw what version of ie?
[22:48:17] <jacta> both 8 - in version 7/8 compatibility
[22:48:20] <Cork> (and can you reproduce on jsfiddle?
[22:48:50] <jacta> worst is that it looks correct in chrome / firefox as I can see :S
[22:49:07] <Cork> sounds like the layout
[22:49:14] <dzarzagza> how would i prevent other events from firing when an event inside is active? because when the window scrolls up it fires the scroll event again
[22:49:15] <Cork> but i would have to see the bug to fix it
[22:49:45] <Cork> dzarzagza: you check if the event is currently active, and if it is you return early?
[22:56:27] <dzarzagza> Cork: not sure how to fix, but am i on the right track? when the window scrolls up after pressing down, the scroll event is triggered again right?
[22:57:07] <Cork> var scrolling = false;   if(scrolling) { return; } scrolling = true; .... scrolling = false;
[22:58:02] <Cork> (and don't forget that animation is async)

[23:28:55] <Lucaszz> Hi
[23:29:26] <coldhead> HI
[23:30:15] <wer0ckz> Hi. Help please. I'm using zclip plugin. The copy div is not working for zclip. http://jsfiddle.net/jmcausing/ScDZu/
[23:31:40] <coldhead> i can't help you with that because it's not a working demo
[23:31:47] <coldhead> there are a bunch of errors in the console
[23:32:31] <coldhead> wer0ckz: did you click the View Source link here? http://www.steamdev.com/zclip/
[23:32:35] <coldhead> they don't use click()
[23:32:44] <coldhead> they just use zclip
[23:33:45] <Lucaszz> When Im using "arguments" variable i can get one object, or array of objects
[23:34:08] <Lucaszz> What is best way to detect if is single object or array of objects?
[23:35:55] <mazzachre> OK, I have now gotten to this http://jsfiddle.net/mazzachre/C64Pm/14/ What I can't quite understand is that when scrolling while resizeing (Try scrolling to the right and then resizing something dragging the mouse to the green or purple boxes) then sometimes the element actually resizes as I want, but if I mose the mouse ever so slightly while in the green or purple fields the resizing stops for a faction of a second and it no
[23:35:55] <mazzachre> longer follows...
[23:36:26] <mazzachre> I am wondering if I should instead record where I started the scrolling and resize the bloxk according to that?!
[23:38:25] <coldhead> Lucaszz: http://jsfiddle.net/xfcuK/
[23:38:27] <coldhead> ?
[23:39:25] <coldhead> Ticks may never hear a tock
[23:41:05] <Lucaszz> coldhead: nope
[23:41:18] <Lucaszz> Single object have length 3
[23:41:20] <coldhead> i may not undersatnd your question
[23:41:36] <coldhead> arguments is always an array as far as i can tell
[23:42:40] <mazzachre> arguments is always an array
[23:44:38] <Lucaszz> coldhead: When function has only one argument
[23:44:56] <Lucaszz> then variable arguments is single object
[23:45:00] <Lucaszz> not array
[23:45:06] <wer0ckz> <coldhead> they don't use click() - i removed the click. please see my jsfiddle again http://jsfiddle.net/jmcausing/ScDZu/2/
[23:47:13] <mazzachre> Lucaszz: That does not sounds right... when given a single argument arguments should be single array with a single element... When given 3 arguments it should be a single array with 3 elements...
[23:48:02] <coldhead> wer0ckz: i would GUESS it should be more like this http://jsfiddle.net/ScDZu/3/
[23:48:07] <coldhead> but i can't tell without an actual live demo
[23:48:38] <coldhead> mazzachre: your patient wisdom is like a drop of moisture in a desert of delusion
[23:48:41] <coldhead> i salute you
[23:49:30] <mazzachre> coldhead: lol :)
[23:49:34] <wer0ckz> coldhead: the copy div is still not working
[23:49:49] <coldhead> wer0ckz: it works fine in my imagination
[23:49:54] <coldhead> WHICH IS ALL I HAVE TO WORK WITH HERE
[23:50:18] <coldhead> in my imagination, when i click it, my body becomes filled with rainbows of delicious joy
[23:50:31] <coldhead> and my clipboard becomes full of data
[23:50:48] <mazzachre> that must be nice :)
[23:52:01] <Lucaszz> mazzachre: http://pastebin.com/cvBXcLsc - this is my example
[23:52:32] <Lucaszz> question is how is safe way to detect if arguments are array or not
[23:53:44] <mowol> Hi. I have this: http://jsfiddle.net/nuCzv/2/ How can i change the bottom select to mark the last non-disabled option?
[23:53:52] <coldhead> ?isarray
[23:53:53] <bot-t> jQuery.isArray(obj): Determine whether the argument is an array. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.isArray/
[23:54:22] <mazzachre> Lucaszz: You don't need to... arguments is always an array no matter what you do about it
[23:54:42] <Lucaszz> in my case ... nope
[23:55:15] <mazzachre> Lucaszz: Then you have hacked your own browser, use one that exist in public domain :)
[23:55:33] <coldhead> you seem very negative, Lucaszz
[23:55:37] <mazzachre> Lucaszz: http://jsfiddle.net/mazzachre/BZc6k/
[23:55:53] <mazzachre> check the console log, it will write 3 arrays
[23:56:13] <mowol> the last-child select doesnt take disabled into account
[23:58:12] <mowol> could i do something like option:not(:disabled):last-child ?
[23:58:56] <mazzachre> mowol: You could filter after... That would probably be better
[23:59:52] <mowol> mazzachre, ok thanks i'll try
[23:59:52] <mazzachre> mowol: Or... you can just select on the not disabled and then take the last element
