[00:02:27] <axilaris> hi mattgifford... here is my json http://pastebin.com/7A9JcYUp , i just want to get the text of title and browser from category
[00:03:33] <Zogot> Category.title?
[00:03:38] <axilaris> i tried for(var key in data.Category) and print the key... it just shows number
[00:03:48] <axilaris> zogot... not that actually
[00:03:57] <axilaris> i want the text "title" not the value
[00:04:06] <Zogot> oh
[00:04:08] <axilaris> the key
[00:04:12] <axilaris> in text
[00:04:32] <axilaris> any idea ?
[00:04:36] <Zogot> a for loop then?
[00:04:52] <axilaris> you mean like this: for(var key in data.Category)
[00:05:08] <Zogot> aye
[00:05:09] <axilaris> and display key ?
[00:05:17] <axilaris> key will show numbers
[00:05:19] <axilaris> 0 and 1
[00:05:26] <axilaris> the iteration number
[00:06:09] <Zogot> another for loop inside that one then?
[00:06:13] <axilaris> it will work if its not in an array... i mean without this brackets [
[00:06:18] <Zogot> so its
[00:06:20] <axilaris> i tried that
[00:06:25] <axilaris> does work either
[00:06:27] <Zogot> lol
[00:06:33] <axilaris> doesnt work
[00:11:13] <Zogot> http://jsfiddle.net/cTWLz/10/
[00:11:17] <Zogot> not sure its the best way
[00:14:25] <Zogot> Obviously, if the data only has Category in it, you can avoid 1 loop
[00:14:46] <Zogot> axilaris
[00:19:23] <iman> would you please some one help me if how can I found at least one of the checkbox group has been checked ?
[00:19:49] <iman> $("#linkTypes input[type=checkbox]:checked").length > 0 ?

[00:52:10] <dr0id> merry xmas
[01:44:46] <Woet> i know it's possible to focus on an input, but is it possible to set the specific position where it will focus? (e.g. in a textarea)
[01:52:37] <hemangpatel> hii there
[01:53:25] <hemangpatel> anyone there ?
[01:55:09] <squeakytoy> MERRY CHRISTMAS GUYS!

[01:59:04] <Zerxer> woet: it's possible
[01:59:14] <Woet> Zerxer: i've just found a solution, thanks
[01:59:20] <Woet> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/499126/jquery-set-cursor-position-in-text-area works
[01:59:22] <Zerxer> by utilizing setSelectionRange/createTextRange
[01:59:38] <Woet> yup
[01:59:43] <Zerxer> you utilized google :) first result
[02:00:07] <Woet> i tried that before asking, but i made a typo which made me believe it didnt work
[03:13:31] <Guest_> hello..
[03:25:34] <Capex> where do you ask a question?
[03:26:40] <walid> Capex: here
[03:26:55] <Capex> okay
[03:27:12] <walid> --help
[03:27:36] <Capex> i am trying to use twitter bootstrap, and no matter what I do, the javascript items don't work.
[03:28:29] <Capex> do you need to include jquery for bootstrap?
[03:28:58] <Devenox> yes I think so
[03:29:26] <Devenox> I also have just installed bootstrap recently and having issues using their js
[03:29:40] <Devenox> but I only dabbled, as part of a django project
[03:29:42] <Capex> yeah
[03:30:24] <Capex> One confirmed issue is that you can't use jquery UI with twitter bootstrap
[03:51:42] <MoTiOnXml> is there a (mootools) Function.from equivalent in jQuery?
[03:51:49] <MoTiOnXml> like a lambda?
[04:21:12] <dabear> MoTiOnXml: no. you can create it your self though
[04:25:08] <dabear> MoTiOnXml: $.funcFrom = function(arg1){ return $.isFunction(arg1) ?  arg1 : function(){ return arg1;}; }
[04:25:29] <dabear> var fn = $.funcFrom(42);alert(fn());
[04:56:58] <ruby_on_tails> $html = "<ol><li>" + $textarea_content.replace("\n", "</li><li>") + "</li></ol>"; why doesnt this split separate lines inputted in a text area into a list ?
[04:57:19] <ruby_on_tails> it shows max 2 list items, splits on the first new line but later doesnt for the the rest of the newlines
[05:06:07] <newJq> ruby_on_tails, try .replace("<br />", /\n/g);
[05:07:01] <ruby_on_tails> newJq: BR ?
[05:07:07] <ruby_on_tails> textarea gives BR tags
[05:07:07] <ruby_on_tails> ?
[05:24:42] <fotoflo> http://tinkerbin.com/60qJfMAu  --- why am i getting an error on line 6? "Uncaught TypeError: Cannot call method 'push' of undefined"
[05:25:36] <fotoflo> is it a closure issue?
[05:26:46] <fotoflo> (I'm new to object constructors in js)
[05:27:55] <fotoflo> any idears?
[05:28:00] <newJq> ruby_on_tails: sorry i try to put <br> tag in textarea and replace it .. replace("<br />", /\n/g);
[05:34:36] <BojanBG> I have a question: I am using a draggable/sortable implementation, and I was wondering if there is a callback function that intercepts the values that are being dropped ? The thing is I want a dynamic value to be dropped other than the fixed value that the draggable has.
[05:35:11] <BojanBG> .join #jqueryui-dev
[05:35:12] <socialhapy> BojanBG: Sorry, admins only
[05:44:08] <fotoflo> fotoflo: http://tinkerbin.com/60qJfMAu  --- can anyone take a quick look? I think i am having either a problem with a closure or a constructor. get an error on line six and not sure why.
[05:45:41] <newJq> fotoflo: try your code with http://jsfiddle.net/F35mP/14/  (i'm new js :)
[05:47:03] <globe_tmp> hi guys
[05:47:14] <fotoflo> newJq: code looks exactly the same
[05:47:21] <newJq> fotoflo: then click JSLint button for check a problem (hope some help)
[05:49:11] <globe_tmp> hi guys i got a use jquery spinner like this http://pastie.org/3070839  , on click of a button a same time an action is done in the server side ; when it finish i send a call back that i can handle threw my function handleComplete
[05:49:27] <globe_tmp> how could i make the sipinner stop by executing my function
[05:49:37] <globe_tmp> sorry fo the noob question
[05:49:46] <newJq> fotoflo: try change first line to function savePlaylist(playlist){
[05:51:26] <newJq> fotoflo: sorry i'm confused :(
[05:51:51] <fotoflo> newjq: /
[05:51:52] <fotoflo> ?
[05:52:16] <fotoflo> I'm not using the arg so changing it won't make a difference
[05:52:51] <fotoflo> i think the problem has to do with the closure in the loop
[05:53:49] <fotoflo> the anonymous function inside the loop doesn't appear to be able to access the object myList
[05:54:57] <fotoflo> either that or there's some problem with my constructor
[05:56:50] <fotoflo> (I'm currently devising ways to test both questions)
[06:50:08] <vdclouis> could some jQuery wizard take a look at this? http://jsfiddle.net/bYwVV/
[06:57:26] <MrGando> Hey guys, I'm trying to use AJAX with jquery… this is what I'm trying to do : https://gist.github.com/478cd97eb84545334b36  , the contact.php is just doing "echo "Hello";" for now …. it's not working :( , any ideas ?
[07:57:52] <axilaris> hi.... if i want to get the value of json key, and the key i have it in text, how to i retrieve the value ?... take example "name" : "john" is in data array, typically its data.name then i get john... but i only get name in text, how do i access the value ? thanks
[09:01:19] <Misiur> Q: why does jQuery site have problems with chrome? Is it because of webkit upgrade, or what?
[09:54:55] <edulterado> this is a dummy question which I forget the answer of: I have 6 div containers and I´d like to slideDown/slideUp another div inside the containers when hover each div at a time; how can I do for slideDown all the 6 divs when hovering just one???
[10:10:19] <sp__> hi guys
[10:10:30] <sp__> I'm a jquery noob, anyone help me with some basic form issues?
[10:10:34] <sp__> .change specifically
[10:26:58] <sp__> awful quiet here, eh?
[10:28:15] <systemfault> Some people unlike me celebrate christmas..
[10:29:23] <sp__> systemfault: that's true
[10:29:30] <sp__> unfortunately, I've got to work, even today
[10:29:42] <systemfault> Same for me
[10:29:56] <sp__> what are you up to systemfault?
[10:30:37] <systemfault> Rewriting a website for work... We have a deadline for january 10th... So every day counts.
[10:31:10] <systemfault> I'm a lead dev on the project so.. I have no other choice than working hard.
[10:31:24] <sp__> my deadline is tomorrow :P
[10:31:31] <systemfault> Outch.
[10:31:34] <sp__> self-assigned too...
[10:31:37] <systemfault> AHhhh
[10:31:40] <systemfault> Not that bad then P
[10:31:41] <systemfault> :P
[10:31:50] <sp__> it's still stupid lvl 9000
[10:31:56] <sp__> forgot all about christmas :P
[10:32:05] <sp__> and said "I'll have it for monday"
[10:32:20] <systemfault> :P
[10:32:51] <sp__> hey systemfault, any clue why I've got to wrap my jQuery with document.ready?
[10:32:56] <edulterado> hi there, this is probably a dummy question which I forget the answer of: I have 6 div containers and I´d like to slideDown/slideUp another div inside the containers when hover each div at a time; how can I do for slideDown all the 6 divs when hovering just one?
[10:32:59] <sp__> else it doesn't run!
[10:33:24] <sp__> edulterado: what do you mean with "slideDown"?? Is it a function?
[10:33:36] <systemfault> sp__: There's no such thing but $(function() { yourquerycodehere }); will do the same.
[10:33:40] <edulterado> i meant, just the contrary, to slideDown just one div and not the six
[10:33:42] <edulterado> yes
[10:34:52] <systemfault> $(document).ready(function(){ yourjquerycodehere }); will also work but unecessary verbose.
[10:34:53] <sp__> systemfault: hmm maybe I was forgetting to open $(function...
[10:35:02] <sp__> systemfault: yes, that's what I was using
[10:35:51] <sp__> hmm... It's broken now.
[10:36:26] <sp__> ahhhh there we go! :)
[10:36:35] <systemfault> :D
[10:36:41] <sp__> so cool
[10:37:43] <ravenzz> ?siblings @ edulterado
[10:37:43] <bot-t> edulterado, .siblings([selector]): Get the siblings of each element in the set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/siblings/
[10:38:04] <ravenzz> ?slideToggle @ edulterado

[10:38:56] <edulterado> thanks a lot ravenzz for the suggestions, I just forgot some basics of jquery after a long time ago without using it
[10:39:15] <ravenzz> np you are welcome
[10:43:32] <MoTiOnXml> ravenzz: does jQuery provide a function that returns coords + dimensions for an object?
[10:43:41] <MoTiOnXml> ravenzz: or do i have to roll my own?
[10:45:17] <ravenzz> [outer]width/[outer]height/position/offset ?
[10:53:56] <MoTiOnXml> ravenzz: yes :)
[10:55:48] <someprimetime> say I've got a list element which has a div and a span within it that both have a style attribute on it. how can i just remove all style attributes within that li?
[10:55:58] <ravenzz> do you mean a function that returns both coords and dimensions?
[10:56:26] <someprimetime> right now, i'm doing something like getting the parent like $(this).parent().find('span').removeAttr('style') and $(this).parent().find('.top-tab-bg').removeAttr('style');
[10:58:16] <ravenzz> what is $(this) ?
[10:58:24] <ravenzz> a LI ?
[10:58:26] <someprimetime> yeah
[10:59:14] <razzi> someprimetime, something like .. $('li div').removeClass('classname');
[10:59:40] <someprimetime> razzi: not quite thanks anyway
[10:59:47] <ravenzz> $(this).parent().find('span, .top-tab-bg').removeAttr('style') ?
[10:59:48] <razzi> lol
[11:00:18] <someprimetime> TIL you can specify multiple selectors with a comma
[11:00:22] <someprimetime> thanks ravenzz
[11:00:41] <Spadeski> Can someone help me with an example id like to constantly slide the last element of a ul list so it makes a kewl slide one by one effect
[11:02:16] <MoTiOnXml> ravenzz: yes, i was after a function equal to mootools' offsetParent()
[11:02:53] <MoTiOnXml> ravenzz: but i guess with jQuery i have to simply call a few functions to get the same result
[11:43:44] <sunscreen>  <script type="text/javascript">document.body.className=((document.body.className)?document.body.className+' js':'js');</script>
[11:43:58] <sunscreen> what a little move :)
[11:46:40] <Anime> doesn't document.body.className += ' js'; work?

[12:25:36] <Misiur> I've got response object, which is ajax response. Now - how can I get whether the response was success, or fail
[13:07:13] <felipe_Brz> I want to have my 3 buttons each load a different html in a target div. Is it possible to 'store' that html content in 3 variables and then load them when each button is clicked? How is that normally done with jquery?
[13:17:35] <mightym> hey guys, I'm a query/js newbie and wonder how to solve this problem: i have several elements on my dom, each has a absolute position, you can remove them or add new ones. there are 2 "modes" how the are displayed, one is that they are sorted on a grid and the other is your personal choice how you positioned them via drag and drop. right now if you switch to the sorted view, the positions are save to a temporary array. so that i can switch back to
[13:17:35] <mightym> "personal" view. that works fine, except if you delete or add elements. for this i need them identified by unique ids. and i don't know how to assure that each element has a unique id. maybe someone has a hint for me? thx in advance!
[13:17:36] <someprimetime> felipe_Brz: look into load()
[13:17:47] <someprimetime> http://api.jquery.com/load/
[13:22:12] <techouse> how do i make jquery change a css value mathematically?
[13:22:39] <techouse> say the height of a node is x and i want jquery to make it x+10
[13:23:04] <techouse> how do i get the numeric part of the css height rule?
[13:23:07] <dabear> techouse: get the height using .height
[13:23:14] <techouse> aha
[13:23:14] <dabear> add 10 to it
[13:23:17] <techouse> oky
[13:23:22] <dabear> then set it again, with .height
[13:23:26] <dabear> see ?height
[13:23:27] <bot-t> .height(): Get the current computed height for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/height/
[13:23:28] <techouse> oky :) thanx!
[13:23:50] <techouse> what if it's some other css feature?
[13:23:56] <techouse> say min-height?
[13:24:36] <dabear> hm, you gotta set  it with css("height", someval+ "px")
[13:25:07] <techouse> yea, but i want it to get the value and then do maths with it
[13:25:18] <dabear> for getting min-height, use css("min-height") and remove the px part
[13:25:28] <techouse> with regex?
[13:25:34] <dabear> up to you
[13:26:35] <techouse> k
[13:28:07] <felipe_Brz> someprimetime: ok thank you
[13:29:32] <dabear> techouse:
[13:29:37] <dabear> ?eval parseInt("100px")
[13:29:42] <bot-t> dabear: 100
[13:29:55] <dabear> ?eval parseInt("100px",0)
[13:29:56] <bot-t> dabear: 100
[13:29:57] <dabear> ?eval parseInt("100px",10)
[13:29:59] <bot-t> dabear: 100
[13:30:05] <dabear> last one is correct^^
[13:32:06] <techouse> dabear yea, was lookiong for something equal to php's intval()
[13:32:31] <techouse> found parseInt(), jst as you said :)
[13:33:39] <mightym> well thank you anyway!
[13:52:59] <felipe_Brz> are there any caveats to using singles quotes in the selectors?????
[13:55:11] <gregoryLwD> felipe_Brz, I think it's just the same as double wuotes
[13:59:47] <felipe_Brz> gregoryLwD: hmm kk
[14:06:50] <felipe_Brz> what is the purpose of attributes like aria-pressed and aria-enabled in some jquery ui widgets??? I can't seem to be able to access them via .prop()...how should we use it?
[14:19:38] <Raydiation> if i define select_lines() function inside $(document).ready(function () { why is it not available when i put it on a <a onclick='select_lines()' ?
[14:26:36] <mightym> or maybe someone could tell me whats the best way to build unique ids? using a timestamp? or a random number?
[14:27:20] <Rembane> mightym: The uuid module is quite nice
[14:27:32] <Rembane> mightym: http://docs.python.org/library/uuid.html
[14:28:14] <mightym> Rembane: python?
[14:28:39] <mightym> Rembane: you mean i should build sth similar?
[14:29:53] <mightym> or did you mean this http://archive.plugins.jquery.com/project/uuid
[14:30:17] <Rembane> mightym: Oh Sorry. Wrong channel. :)
[14:30:31] <mightym> Rembane: :D np
[14:30:47] <Rembane> mightym: That plugin could actually work
[14:31:15] <Rembane> mightym: But timestamps are nice too. Milliseconds are good stuff.
[14:32:19] <mightym> Rembane: what about unix timestamp?
[14:32:49] <mightym> Rembane: ah sry you wrote it … I've a laggy connection
[14:34:56] <Rembane> mightym: ^^
[14:35:19] <Rembane> mightym: No worries, if you are absolutely certain that only one thing will come in per millisecond it should work perfectly
[14:35:44] <mightym> yes, thats sure
[14:37:13] <Rembane> mightym: Sounds good.

[14:50:19] <zodiak> hey guys, we are having a bit of a debate at work the past week, why is $() over use considered an anti-pattern ?
[14:54:41] <dabear> zodiak: simple, the jquery constructor ( which is the same as $() ) does a lot of work. it is often unneccessary, as you can cache the result of the first call to it and use that instead
[14:56:24] <edulterado> hi there, when landing in my personal site, I would like to make all the elements hide except one, and when click in that element, the rest will appear, which selector can I use for identifying the whole elements of the page except one?
[14:57:19] <dabear> zodiak: also, repeating your self is a known anti-pattern :)
[14:57:58] <dabear> edulterado: are you sure you don't want something like an accordion instead?
[14:58:09] <dabear> edulterado: see ?jquery ui accordion
[14:58:10] <bot-t> edulterado, jquery: A string containing the jQuery version number. http://api.jquery.com/jquery/
[14:58:23] <dabear> hm
[14:58:24] <dabear> http://jqueryui.com/demos/accordion/
[14:58:42] <edulterado> thank you, dabear , i will explore it
[14:59:00] <edulterado> i was using siblings() for making groups and hide then, except one
[14:59:10] <edulterado> but i was wondering for a complementary approach
[15:00:16] <dabear> siblings() should work, yes. but depending on your needs, accordions may or may not be a better fit
[15:01:17] <edulterado> dabear , accordion is a very nice plugin, but it does´t fit well with what I had in mind
[15:01:31] <edulterado> for my personal photo portfolio, I wanted just one picture to be in the page when it loads
[15:01:31] <edulterado> a
[15:01:32] <edulterado> n
[15:01:32] <edulterado> d
[15:01:40] <edulterado> and when clicking on the picture
[15:01:47] <edulterado> the header and other elements will appear
[15:02:23] <edulterado> it´s like a landing page, but in a unique one
[15:02:50] <]Darker[> hi guys
[15:02:52] <edulterado> i was wondering which is the selector for handling the whole DOM
[15:03:00] <dabear> edulterado: same as in css
[15:03:00] <Spadeski> Can we get a ban on edulterado
[15:03:04] <dabear> $("*")
[15:03:06] <edulterado> (I don´t know if I put that correclty)
[15:03:26] <edulterado> thank you dabear
[15:04:12] <dabear> you shouldn't do that in js though, as it will most likely cause a flash of unstyled content type error ( google that if you don't know what I mean)
[15:04:34] <edulterado> yes, I was figuring it out
[15:06:02] <dabear> I would do <div class="hasjs initialhide"> on all items that should be hidden
[15:06:15] <zodiak> dabear, sorry.. think I am lagged. so. if $() has a lot of overhead, put those blocks into document.ready() ?
[15:06:20] <]Darker[II]> ...i was saying
[15:06:26] <]Darker[II]> I just post a html file that contains the full example of my code
[15:06:53] <]Darker[II]> I am trying to understand why if I comment the animate() function my feature works properly
[15:07:07] <]Darker[II]> but If I uncomment it, the dom swap is totally messed up
[15:07:26] <dabear> zodiak: no, make it so that you don't have to use $() so many times. or simply use document.getElementById
[15:07:46] <dabear> it will always be faster

[15:09:21] <bot-t> ]Darker[, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue. While a static paste can sometimes be useful, it does not allow us to experience the issue and tangibly debug it.
[15:09:47] <]Darker[> ok, i'll post it :)
[15:09:58] <dabear> zodiak: but do some profiling of what parts of your code that consumes cpu time and memory. calling $() 50+ in a code should be no problem. however calling $("*") 50 times in your code would be a problem
[15:10:14] <dabear> as the "*" selector is unoptimized and generally slower
[15:10:33] <ravenzz> ]Darker[ you should remove the quotes
[15:10:46] <ravenzz> animate({ opacity: 0 })
[15:12:13] <]Darker[> http://jsfiddle.net/4Q2sh/
[15:12:15] <]Darker[> :)
[15:12:17] <dabear> zodiak: also, most often you don't need to select elements, atleast if you're just applying event handlers (use .live, .delegate or the newer .on )
[15:12:36] <]Darker[> i didn't know jsfiddle, tnx :D
[15:12:45] <]Darker[> anyway, it's very basic
[15:12:52] <]Darker[> when you click a Red" block
[15:13:01] <]Darker[> the block moves to left
[15:13:15] <]Darker[> the "old" on the left moves on the top on the right
[15:13:23] <zodiak> dabear, useful information/pointers. dankeschoen
[15:13:36] <]Darker[> and all the block that are behind the one clicked, move down
[15:13:41] <]Darker[> and it works as inteded now
[15:14:00] <]Darker[> the problem is, if I enable the commented "animate()" function
[15:14:06] <]Darker[> everything is messed
[15:14:14] <]Darker[> and I cannot understand why
[15:14:19] <ravenzz> ..
[15:14:27] <ravenzz> [00:10] <ravenzz> ]Darker[ you should remove the quotes
[15:14:31] <ravenzz> [00:10] <ravenzz> animate({ opacity: 0 })
[15:14:55] <]Darker[> :o
[15:15:21] <dabear> zodiak: but that it basic programming knowledge, or at least it should be.. don't do things twice if you can do it only once and re-use the result. don't over-optimize and do profile your code to figure out what needs optimizing
[15:15:42] <kborchers> ]Darker[: ravenzz is correct. that should do it
[15:15:55] <]Darker[> I removed the double quotes
[15:15:59] <]Darker[> but the problem persists
[15:16:22] <zodiak> dabear, well, the problem isn't so much that -1- person keeps putting it in 100 files, but that 7 people put it in 4 each
[15:16:30] <kborchers> in the fiddle? you have to click update after you make changes
[15:16:40] <ravenzz> ]Darker[ you have an Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token += d += 250;
[15:16:53] <zodiak> but.. I know what you are saying. sadly, this may mean that one person acts as the js czar .. and I get the feeling, that's going to be me *ugh* :)
[15:17:23] <zodiak> danke
[15:17:37] <dabear> zodiak: code review and general agreed upon rules on how to do stuff would solve that
[15:17:58] <]Darker[> ravenzz, i don't see that error
[15:18:02] <dabear> also, having a clean structure helps a lot
[15:18:11] <dabear> like a mvc pattern
[15:18:53] <systemfault> Mixed Views and Controllers? ;)
[15:19:16] <systemfault> (Because that's what I usually see in projects...)
[15:19:33] <systemfault> Or... Much Views and Cronjobs.
[15:22:21] <]Darker[> uhm
[15:22:31] <]Darker[> i am still stucked :|
[15:23:12] <Spadeski> ]Darker[:  Thats cause its an uncaught error you have to go into your code and change yourself
[15:23:46] <]Darker[> But I don't see the error :D
[15:24:40] <Spadeski>  ]Darker[ Its definetely there :p
[15:27:33] <ravenzz> ]Darker[ you should write it again. that it is a bit messy
[15:27:49] <ravenzz> use the JavaScript panel
[15:29:14] <]Darker[> http://jsfiddle.net/4Q2sh/8/
[15:29:16] <]Darker[> done

[16:54:12] <nexus74> Merry Christmas
[16:54:38] <nexus74> I want to replace the 138px here: panel.css({ height: '138px' }); with a variabel
[16:55:27] <nexus74> I tried "var maxHeight = 50 +'px';" but no go
[16:58:37] <systemfault> nexus74: panel.css('height', myVar + px); ?
[17:01:09] <nexus74> systemfault: thank you, but a comma after height, not a colon?
[17:02:24] <systemfault> TRue
[17:03:14] <systemfault> It's either: panel.css('height', theValue); or panel.css({'height': theValue});
[17:03:47] <systemfault> With the second form, you can change more than a single property at a time.
[17:03:48] <nexus74> systemfault: I can't get the syntax right, it just keeps that part of the site from showing
[17:04:24] <nexus74> systemfault: I may not formatting the var correctly...
[17:08:19] <nexus74> with panel.css({'height': theValue}); how do i format the variable?
[17:12:08] <nexus74> with panel.css({'height': theValue}); how do i format the variable?
[17:20:59] <nexus74> Got it: var minHeight = 50;
[17:21:11] <nexus74> panel.css({ height: minHeight +'px' });
[17:26:37] <nocturne7> do you guys now a way to have datepicker refresh itself when the input box is changed manually ?
[18:03:29] <nocturne7> guys, I need help with datepicker
[18:03:49] <Vaerros> nope
[18:04:11] <Vaerros> (jk) just ask the question
[18:04:15] <nocturne7> http://pastebin.com/mDQbXkKa
[18:04:39] <nocturne7> when I change the input field manually, the date range does not get updated
[18:04:58] <nocturne7> I got input fields in the form of 'to' and 'from'
[18:07:47] <tomasm-> hi, i'm calling a simple wrap() on a div and notice that for some reason, it causes <script> tags to execute twice.... does this make sense? is there a way to prevent this?
[18:08:11] <bhk9> Hi. I'm trying to send some data with the post command. So, there is a form with data to send and some additional data. But how can i send both data togheter?
[18:25:09] <tomasm-> any idea how to clone() an object without accidentally re-evaluating <script> tags inside of it? i have event handlers that get duplicates attached because of this.... i'm using clone() only because wrap() uses it.... perhaps there's a way to use a wrap() equivalent without cloning/removing/etc the original elements?
[18:34:51] <vladikoff> happy holidays BinaryKitten!
[18:54:48] <nocturne7> this channel is awfully quiet
[18:58:25] <tomasm-> <cricket noises>
[19:21:34] <Chibby_> nocturne7: how are you changing the field?
[19:22:51] <nocturne7> Chibby_:  actually, the whole thing works, it adjusts the range appropriately as long as I do not enter the date manually myself.
[19:24:18] <nocturne7> when I enter the date manually and tab to the 'to' input box, the datepicker does not update itself accordingly
[19:26:35] <Chibby_> what are you expecting it to update?
[19:28:53] <nocturne7> Chibby_ I am expecting it to update the date range. For instance, if I have for from: 11/10/2011 it will prevent me from selecting a date earlier than 11/10/2011 for to
[19:30:34] <nocturne7> the problem is  if I change the 'from'  field manually, say, to 11/4/2011 and tab to 'to' it still thinks the min date is 11/10/2011
[19:30:36] <Chibby_> datepicker does not do that
[19:30:46] <Chibby_> err
[19:31:55] <Chibby_> not really sure what you mean by i thinks the main date is 11/10, but datechecker doesn't restrict what dates you can put in manually
[19:32:02] <Chibby_> it*
[19:33:59] <nocturne7> if I enter change the date of 'from' manually, datechecker of 'to' is not updated about the new possible range
[19:34:17] <nocturne7> that is, it does not now the latest min date
[19:34:59] <nocturne7> it still assumes that the latest min date is the one that I entered using datepicker's calander widget
[19:36:22] <nocturne7> I think I have found a solution http://stackoverflow.com/a/333585/776658
[19:36:42] <Chibby_> well the way your code looks it wouldn't, onSelect is only run when you select with the mouse
[19:37:46] <aidan> Anyone here work with Drupal and interested in doing some paid work? I want to get Drupal6 working with jQuery1.7
[19:38:33] <nocturne7> Chibby_ that is why I should be using "beforeShow" I think
[19:49:35] <evertonrc> How do I select an element with an id that starts with XXX? I tried $("div[id|='XXX']") but no cigar
[20:08:36] <SrPx> guys help me, this is URGENT. I need a not expensive, trustable web host I can throw a site so it will be online in no less than a few minutes!
[20:56:47] <Chibby_> everonrc: $('div[id^="XXX"]')
[20:57:43] <Eviltwin> SrPx: I use DreamHost
[20:57:57] <Eviltwin> SrPx: Once you're set up, it's really fast to throw up sites
[21:02:08] <daff__> Hello Flocks.I'm using jquery ui date picker.When a end user selects a date on calendar,i want that string to pass to jquery ajax function.Here is my snippet http://pastebin.com/RUFaZ61Z
[21:05:47] <Eviltwin> ?.ajax @ daff__
[21:05:48] <bot-t> daff__, jQuery.ajax(url, [settings]): Perform an asynchronous HTTP (Ajax) request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[21:06:43] <daff__> bot-t: I'm not getting that value that is present in the text box.I know the ajax function but my problem is ,i'm not getting that value that is present in text box
[21:06:44] <bot-t> daff__, Stored "I'm not getting that value that".
[21:07:55] <Eviltwin> Take a wild guess at what the first parameter is

[21:53:26] <alFReD-NSH> Hi, anyone knows why this is not working and my form gets submitted?
[21:53:27] <alFReD-NSH> $('.comment').submit(function(e) {
[21:53:27] <alFReD-NSH>         e.preventDefault();
[21:53:27] <alFReD-NSH>         console.log('works')
[21:53:27] <alFReD-NSH>     });
[21:54:05] <alFReD-NSH> the function never gets fired
[21:54:36] <alFReD-NSH> I'm using chrome 16 btw
[21:55:20] <Eviltwin> Is "comment" the class on the form itself?
[21:55:46] <alFReD-NSH> < form class="class">
[21:55:57] <alFReD-NSH> < form class="comment">*
[21:56:03] <alFReD-NSH> that's how is it
[21:56:22] <Eviltwin> Is the form in the page when you run that code?
[21:56:30] <alFReD-NSH> yes it
[21:56:34] <alFReD-NSH> it is*
[21:57:00] <alFReD-NSH> let me try another selector
[21:57:45] <Eviltwin> http://jsfiddle.net/5k8G6/
[22:12:34] <alFReD-NSH> Eviltwin: Weirdly it works, when I do that in console, but not in the code
[22:13:04] <Eviltwin> Try doing console.log($(".comments")) right before
[22:14:25] <alFReD-NSH> I get an empty array!
[22:15:08] <Eviltwin> So they're not there when the code is being run
[22:16:55] <alFReD-NSH> Eviltwin: it is on $(document).ready
[22:18:00] <Eviltwin> Are the <form class="comments"> in the HTML?
[22:18:03] <Eviltwin> Or are they added
[22:18:51] <alFReD-NSH> they are in the HTML
[22:19:51] <alFReD-NSH> it works in firefox
[22:20:36] <Engin> is it possible to load a CSS file later and make it override the current one ?
[22:22:49] <alFReD-NSH> it works in opera 11.60
[22:24:18] <alFReD-NSH> only doesn't work on chrome 16
[22:37:46] <vimal_> hello every body
