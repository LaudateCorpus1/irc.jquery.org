[00:00:09] <Ricaz> anyone here have any experience with Quintus?
[00:00:45] <Ricaz> driving me fucking crazy that I can't move a single sprite
[00:01:16] <Cork> isn't quintus using canvas?
[00:03:49] <mboro> I'm doing an AJAX wrapper because all my ajax calls needs to do some async work before doing the ajax request. I want the wrapper to return the ajax object right away but I don't want the request to fire before I'm ready. any way to do that?
[00:04:49] <Cork> mboro: the request won't fire before the stack has spun all the way back to the browser
[00:05:04] <Cork> so just return it
[00:05:23] <Cork> mboro: unless you actually mean returning the response data from your wrapper
[00:05:30] <Cork> (thats not possible)
[00:05:45] <mboro> Cork: one moment, will show you in pseudo code
[00:06:24] <Alarm> hello, i got a problem with the date when using json.stringify and send the data back to the server
[00:06:26] <Engin> what would be a good channel for general discussion for web stack ?
[00:06:42] <Alarm> when i retrieve and preview the date, in the request my date has the form like : Date {Tue Feb 05 2013 08:12:00 GMT+0200 (GTB Standard Time)}
[00:07:08] <mboro> Cork: something like this I what I'm curently doing: http://pastie.org/private/bfdvep4kcdclzupsyddmiq
[00:07:17] <Cork> Alarm: simplest is prob to use the iso standard, and save the date as a string
[00:07:19] <Alarm> after using json.stringify to send it to server, the date loses those 2 hours because of the GMT
[00:07:31] <Alarm> so the final  result of the date is 2013-02-05T06:12:00.000Z
[00:07:55] <Alarm> well i cannot save it as a string. we use a Date datatype in the DB
[00:08:11] <Alarm> also the member in the entity is of type "date"
[00:08:33] <Cork> mboro: ok, and the problem is?
[00:08:41] <Alarm> the problem is that i cannot find how or why those 2 hours are lost
[00:08:57] <mboro> Cork: well, the problem is that the actual jQuery XHR object isn't exposed but only the deferred
[00:09:19] <Cork> mboro: ya, why do you need to overide the done and fail?
[00:09:32] <Cork> from what i see there you could just return the xhr object
[00:09:58] <Cork> return $.ajax();
[00:10:19] <Cork> ajax().done().readyState
[00:11:19] <Cork> jqXHR alreayd includes a deffered object
[00:11:31] <Cork> ah
[00:12:00] <Cork> you do deffere on the doAsyncWork too
[00:12:01] <Cork> hmm
[00:12:04] <rideh> Cork: man if you saw what i've done,,,, it makes me sad inside but it works
[00:12:38] <Cork> mboro: i was fiddeling with something like this a while back too
[00:12:56] <Cork> mboro: only way is to do the same thing $.ajax does
[00:13:09] <Cork> create a fake jqXHR object and return that
[00:13:15] <Cork> then set the states when they change
[00:13:51] <Cork> its tricky, but as you don't have the XHR or jqXHR object when the deffered is returned you don't have an option
[00:13:52] <mboro> Cork: I feared that was the only way. that's gonna be a bit trick as jQuery for one doesn't have an onreadystatechange event
[00:14:11] <Cork> mboro: have a look at what $.ajax does
[00:14:17] <rideh> cork: http://m.runyonsurfaceprep.com/calculators  if you want to cringe look at lines 63:74 in /js/app.js
[00:14:20] <Cork> but ya, you might have to extend it deep
[00:14:30] <mboro> Cork: will do. thx :)
[00:15:08] <Cork> ugg..
[00:15:21] <Cork> rideh: well, every one for there taste
[00:15:45] <rideh> i have like 10 more things on my todo list, this was a biggy
[00:15:54] <rideh> its also now #1 on the refactor list
[00:16:29] <fat> I have 2 css files (1 is the original bootstrap css file and the other one is my own custom bootstrap css file). if i use the original bootstrap css file, my website's font goes massive and bolder etc, but it has perfect gap at the bottom (see image). However, if i use my custom one the font size is perfect but at the bottom, there is no gap (see image). My image http://uploadnow.org/image/344265-great.png
[00:18:12] <rideh> fat: funny name for difficulties with bootstrap first of all, second use the base css file and load a 2nd css file afterwards with personal settings to override it - OR - use less and change the origional files and keep track of your changes - OR do the same but with your own less file you load last
[00:18:18] <rideh> also, wrong channel
[00:21:54] <fat> ridehL what do u think is the best way?
[00:21:56] <Ricaz> Cork, yes, quintus is using canvas
[00:22:22] <Ricaz> can anyone recommend an easy to use game library/engine?
[00:22:25] <fat> rideh: what do u think is the best way
[00:22:42] <Ricaz> i just need to make a Pong game
[00:22:58] <fat> ricaz: java with slick addon
[00:23:29] <rideh> fat: personally I've taken a liking to less, and for HUGE css libraries like that it makes it much more managable to make intelligent changes . I like to create my own less file and add it to the less bootstrap process so it gets loaded *lastish*
[00:23:50] <fat> rideh: im new to css, so how do i "override"
[00:24:12] <fat> rideh: or can u help me create my on bootsrap css file?
[00:24:13] <rideh> i dont actually load it last as there is stuff in there to fix behavior difference between browsers, that needs to actually happen last
[00:24:36] <fat> rideh: please help, im not real good @ css
[00:24:39] <rideh> fat: to override something is as simple as <p style="color:black;color:white">
[00:25:02] <fat> rideh: there are 2 colors. which one will it choose?
[00:25:15] <rideh> just keep assigning styles to the same elements (works with all the selectors afaik) and it will always read the last
[00:25:39] <rideh> big thing with css is inheritence, if you arent familiar with that concept it is worth taking a few minutes to learn
[00:26:13] <fat> rideh: i understand teh basic concepts of it, but bootstrap css is 7000 lines long.
[00:26:47] <rideh> most tools make that really apparent when you are looking at end content and you see a lot of greyed out css or crossthrus.  that is displaying that something either later or more specific took precidence… im simplifying the idea a bit
[00:26:48] <Cork> Ricaz: ya, so it depends if they actually store the different segments as separate images in the canvas
[00:27:12] <rideh> fat: thats why i suggest using the less version, its 12 files eacha bout 40 lines long,,, much easier to make sense of
[00:27:26] <Ricaz> fat, has to be js
[00:27:26] <fat> rideh: where is that
[00:27:39] <Ricaz> Cork, what do you mean?
[00:27:50] <Ricaz> Cork, they showed plenty of working examples on their site
[00:27:51] <fat> ricaz: are u sure its js?
[00:28:01] <Ricaz> fat, sure what is js?
[00:28:04] <rideh> fat: https://github.com/twitter/bootstrap click on the less folder to brwose it
[00:28:29] <fat> ricaz: javascript?
[00:29:02] <rideh> fat: https://github.com/twitter/bootstrap/blob/master/less/variables.less is probably 90% of what you are trying to change
[00:29:15] <Ricaz> fat, the game has to be done in javascript, yes. java != javascript
[00:29:28] <Ricaz> and quintus is definately js
[00:29:42] <Ricaz> but i can't get that shit to work
[00:29:43] <fat> ricaz: i donno then
[00:29:49] <Ricaz> what's the alternative to using canvas?
[00:29:52] <fat> ricaz: i don't use js lol
[00:30:02] <Ricaz> fat, but you're in a jquery channel
[00:30:24] <fat> rideh: I only use it for basic things, not to make a pong game
[00:30:31] <fat> rideh: i use it for tabs, dropdown menu etc.
[00:30:48] <fat> Rideh: I have this <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="Includes/Javascript/Bootstrap/Floating_Bar.css">. which reperesents my custom css file..
[00:31:01] <rideh> fat: you are in the wrong place man but this might help: http://www.w3resource.com/twitter-bootstrap/twitter-bootstrap-with-less.php
[00:31:36] <trinadh> fat: http://webdesign.tutsplus.com/tutorials/workflow-tutorials/twitter-bootstrap-101-customize/  , if you have time take a look at entire series
[00:32:06] <rideh> trinadh: thanks was looking for that, was a pretty good one
[00:32:51] <Ricaz> noone has a better suggestion for a js game library?
[00:33:57] <rideh> Ricaz: sorry thats a direction i've not traveled with js
[00:34:00] <Gambit-> hoy chaps
[00:34:14] <trinadh> fat: https://github.com/twitter/bootstrap/blob/master/less/type.less , that is the less file to change typography , and basefont size etc variables in the file rideh sugested
[00:34:20] <tw2113> fat...jQuery = javascript
[00:34:26] <Gambit-> how are you supposed to take something like http://api.jqueryui.com/autocomplete/ and change the styling on how options are rendered?
[00:34:28] <tw2113> you're using javascript all the time
[00:34:59] <rideh> Gambit-: somewhere in that library comes some css, change that?
[00:35:03] <trinadh> rideh: yes, learnt a lot from that site :)
[00:35:25] <Cork> Gambit-: just write a css file that changes those values
[00:35:26] <Gambit-> rideh, well I want to change more than just the css layout, I want to make a rich text representation, possibly with images etc.
[00:35:45] <Gambit-> I guess I was wondering if there's a default render function I should overload in some form...?
[00:36:04] <Cork> Gambit-: the renderer is called the browsers css
[00:36:08] <Cork> Gambit-: just overide the css
[00:36:21] <Trisox> Is jquery javascript? have i been using javascript ......!!!  men i hope i dont get a rash
[00:36:25] <rideh> Gambit-: ^ unless they are using some funky canvas stuff then override that
[00:36:32] <Gambit-> the css isn't going to choose to render all of the additional data points that are returned from the search engine's json.
[00:36:41] <Cork> rideh: they arn't
[00:36:47] <Trisox> Cork: o/
[00:36:58] <fat> trinadh: do u know how i can put that gap
[00:37:03] <rideh> Cork: thanks, i'm not familiar with it, and trying to handle the questions i can manage to pay it back.
[00:37:08] <Cork> Gambit-: ah, thats whats in it, not the rendering
[00:37:20] <Cork> Gambit-: theres examples of that in the documentation
[00:37:38] <Gambit-> It will return a bunch of objects with lots of internal data pieces and I want to render a bunch of the pieces as part of the reply into something pretty with an image and such as part of the list.
[00:37:56] <Cork> Gambit-: check the "multiple values"
[00:38:03] <Gambit-> On the lage I linked to?
[00:38:09] <Cork> yes
[00:38:25] <Gambit-> multiple values isn't even on the page I linked to...
[00:38:27] <Cork> and the custom data might be interesting too
[00:38:36] <Cork> ah your on the api page
[00:38:41] <Cork> Gambit-: http://jqueryui.com/autocomplete/
[00:38:51] <Cork> thats the documentation page ^
[00:39:05] <Gambit-> ooh, didn't realize there were other examples over on the right like that...
[00:39:58] <Gambit-> hrm I don't see it rendering compplicated data per object returned...
[00:39:59] <Cork> Gambit-: from how how you first explained it, it sounded like you just wanted to style it :)
[00:40:08] <Cork> Gambit-: there is two
[00:40:12] <Gambit-> yeah, I don't use the right terminology, alas.
[00:40:16] <Cork> multible values and custom data
[00:40:29] <Cork> *multiple
[00:40:38] <trinadh> fat: you are supposed to change the typography.. i.e in this case font size, line 681 to 701 or nearby.. in unminified bootstrap.css
[00:40:41] <Gambit-> the custom data and display only displays things after their selected
[00:40:46] <Gambit-> I want to change how the dropdown list is rendered.
[00:41:17] <Cork> Gambit-: that would be the custom data
[00:41:44] <fat> trinadh: im not using the base bootstrap css file. im using a custom 1 http://goo.gl/TVYEd
[00:41:47] <Gambit-> it only, at least in my browser, shows the basic list, it doesn't show the gfx and stuff in the dropdown itself.  Only afterwards.
[00:41:51] <Cork> Gambit-: just test the custom data function
[00:42:43] <rideh> fat: inspect elements on both verisons, compare what is listed as the css that is applied
[00:42:55] <fat> rideh: lookingn ow
[00:43:20] <Cork> Gambit-: look at its code and try to understand what they're doing
[00:43:21] <rideh> fat: in the future its usually polite to ask before pm'ing someone
[00:43:35] <fat> rideh: sorry
[00:43:51] <Cork> and normally its better to not pm
[00:43:52] <Gambit-> Cork, I can look at the code all I want - it doesn't seem to /work/.  If you type 'j' in that box, do you get fancy list, or do you get the same dropdown list all of the other examples have?
[00:44:00] <Cork> unless you need to send private data
[00:44:09] <Cork> more ppl get to learn from it
[00:44:17] <rideh> people can search these logs and learn
[00:44:20] <Cork> sigh
[00:44:21] <rideh> bah beat me
[00:44:35] <Cork> Gambit-: unless you actually want to look for how to solve it you won't
[00:45:11] <Gambit-> Cork, you could also tell me that the ._renderItem function is responsible for doing the render, even if it doesn't seem to be working in this example.
[00:45:23] <Gambit-> I would tell you that if it's not working in that example, what am I supposed to look at to find out how to make it work?
[00:45:29] <Cork> why, its in the example i pointed to T_T
[00:45:52] <Gambit-> Maybe I'm not communicating what I'm expecting?
[00:45:55] <rideh> fat: please stop pm'ng me.  codeacademy has a good primer on basic css, html, js that would be vaulable for you to run through. Also look up a vid or two on how to use the developer tools in browsers (firebug, develper tools, whatever) if you arent sure what things do
[00:45:58] <Gambit-> Or maybe it's doing something different on your browser?
[00:46:10] <fat> rideh: ok
[00:46:26] <Cork> sigh, Gambit- when you want to do something, take an example snippet and lab with it
[00:46:38] <Cork> if you don't manage to get it to do what you want; THEN you can complain
[00:47:01] <Cork> don't complain before you even try it
[00:47:17] <Gambit-> I'm not complaining, I'm just pointing out that the example snippet - that /is/ what's being demonstrated at the top, right? - doesn't seem to be working.  Now, if you're telling me that what the top is running and what the 'show source' panel shows isn't the same thing, then that's one thing.
[00:47:28] <rideh> I admit im guilty of reposting questions to get attention now and then - but man i dont expect someone to feed me
[00:47:40] <Cork> Gambit-: the example does what it intends to do, but thats not exactly what you want to do
[00:47:47] <Cork> Gambit-: but the points you need are in there
[00:48:04] <Gambit-> Shouldn't the example's dropdown have two-line items, the label followed by the description?
[00:48:12] <fat> rideh: ok
[00:48:23] <Gambit-> That's what I would have expected, if the code was actually working.
[00:48:30] <Gambit-> based on ln 68 in the src.
[00:49:14] <Gambit-> Does it work for you, I guess is what I'm saying, or have you not tried it?
[00:49:55] <rideh> Gambit-: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10934193/ui-autocomplete-formatting-li-results-on-2-lines
[00:50:41] <Gambit-> rideh, I got that the ._renderItem is supposed to do that.  I just don't actually see it happening in the example provided.
[00:50:52] <Gambit-> That's why I'm trying to figure out if it's something about my setup, or if it's just something that's broken.
[00:50:56] <rideh> Gambit-: second answer: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4937033/jquery-ui-autocomplete-formatting-for-multiple-elements
[00:51:03] <rideh> looks like it might be broken
[00:51:09] <Gambit-> THANK YOU :)
[00:51:18] <Cork> sigh...
[00:51:26] <fat> rideh: when i inspect the button, they both give out same thing: button.btn.btn-primary 65px x 30px
[00:51:34] <Gambit-> That's what I needed to hear.
[00:51:57] <rideh> fat: do you see all of the css stuff on the right panel? thats the rules that are applied via css.  thats what you need to compare...
[00:52:01] <Gambit-> You can point me at broken examples all you want, but if they're broken in the specific fashion I'm trying to reproduce, they aren't going to be a lot of help to me.
[00:52:11] <Cork> Gambit-: sigh, its not a broken example
[00:52:23] <Cork> its an example of how to modify the output
[00:52:34] <Cork> if you can't put one and two together...
[00:53:07] <fat> rideh: OOH
[00:53:08] <Gambit-> Why do you say it's not broken?
[00:53:19] <Cork> cause it does what its code says it should do
[00:53:30] <Cork> it just happens to not be the effect your looking for
[00:53:37] <Gambit-> It does?
[00:53:40] <Cork> so add the effect you want
[00:54:04] <Gambit-> Shoudln't it render each option as 'jQuery the write less, do more, JavaScript library"?
[00:54:11] <Gambit-> On my screen it just says 'jQuery'.
[00:54:19] <mazzachre> I have a simple html with some lists in list, that I run som jquery on... however $('ol', this).each(...) runs ... on the lists recursivly AND itterativly, so inner lists are done as many times as they are nested in... How to handle it?
[00:55:01] <Cork> mazzachre: $(this).children().each()
[00:55:22] <Cork> or use the outer parent
[00:55:25] <mazzachre> Cork, but I can't be sure that the list are direct children...
[00:55:38] <Gambit-> Because that's what the code looks like it says it should be doing, Cork, and you're telling me it's working properly, yet that isn't the output I see.  So are you just telling me it's working properly because you aren't reading the code, or are you telling me it's working properly because it actually does work properly on your browser?
[00:55:42] <Cork> mazzachre: then you have to either use a parent reference or a class
[00:57:22] <mazzachre> Cork: Ah thx :) I didn't think of that... I can use the class I add anyway to filter the ones that I already done :)
[00:58:05] <fat> rideh: ok i got them and put them in a difference checker. http://www.diffchecker.com/978syIY4 the left box is the original bootstrap css and the right one my custom one.
[00:58:18] <Cork> mazzachre: there is another way too $('ol', this).not('ol ol')
[00:59:28] <mazzachre> Cork: Hmm, ya... That worked... and is pretty :)
[01:00:30] <mazzachre> Cork: Thx!
[01:00:35] <Cork> np
[01:00:37] <rideh> Gambit-:  you got pointed inthe right direction, Cork helps lots of people. lets just move on?
[01:00:50] <Gambit-> Uncaught TypeError: Cannot set property '_renderItem' of undefined custom-data.html:66
[01:01:02] <fat> rideh: ok i compared them, now what do  ido to fix this?
[01:01:18] <mazzachre> Cork: Should I do $('ol:not(ol ol)', this)? or $('ol', this).not('ol ol') ?
[01:01:22] <rideh> fat: i was hoping that'd be pretty apparent once you saw the differences..
[01:01:35] <Cork> mazzachre: the later is speedier, but its up to you
[01:01:45] <rideh> fat: you need to take whatever the difference is and apply it to the appropriate proejct
[01:01:47] <Cork> both should work
[01:01:56] <mazzachre> Cork: OYa, but I choose the speedier :)
[01:02:12] <Cork> mazzachre: the difference isn't big :)
[01:02:18] <Cork> for normal cases that is
[01:04:52] <fat> rideh: OK im looking now
[01:05:15] <rideh> fat: http://jsfiddle.net/ to play with stuff to see what it does
[01:06:00] <fat> rideh: this text difference is soo hard
[01:06:00] <JBlitzen> Jesus jquery and jquery-ui are powerful
[01:06:31] <rideh> fat just put them side by side and look, there can't be THAT many rules applied
[01:06:43] <fat> rideh: ok
[01:07:07] <Cork> mazzachre: http://jsperf.com/notvnot
[01:14:20] <trinadh> fat: http://fiddle.jshell.net/trinadh/ppMdb/ , check how the alignment changes..
[01:14:46] <fat> trinadh: how does that happen
[01:16:30] <fat> trinadh: i inspected both the elements
[01:16:52] <trinadh> fat: thats because of the structure.. it has nothing to do with btn class
[01:17:04] <fat> trinadh: did u see my iamge
[01:17:11] <fat> trinadh: image*
[01:17:39] <rideh> fat: basics please http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_boxmodel.asp
[01:18:03] <rideh> saying there are A LOT of resources for learning the basics at this stuff is understatement
[01:18:04] <seutje> omh, you linked to w3schools!
[01:18:09] <seutje> omg, even
[01:18:15] <trinadh> fat: i saw it, did you check the fiddle, the alignment of buttons and html in it...?
[01:18:21] <rideh> seutje i was feeling lucky,,,,, now i feel robbed
[01:18:42] <trinadh> fat: its the wrapper div's not the button itself
[01:18:58] <fat> trinadh: OOH
[01:19:10] <rideh> fat: http://www.agiledesigners.com/ click on the learn tab
[01:20:15] <fat> trinadh: should i put a span div before my first button
[01:20:27] <seutje> I'll never understand bootstrap
[01:20:39] <seutje> why does a row need a negative margin?
[01:21:06] <fat> trinadh: or a row div
[01:21:40] <djQuery> ?w3fools#trinadh
[01:21:50] <trinadh> go through all the links being suggested, take some time to understand and would be better, if you use #css channel
[01:21:52] <djQuery> damn lazy bot
[01:21:54] <rideh> seutje: All columns in the grid have a 20px left margin, and the row negative indents the first one so it all lines up properly.
[01:22:19] <seutje> the backwards way of doing grids?
[01:22:59] <rideh> seutje: stole mdo's comment on a bug report about it… but yeah instead of making special case for first column on the column itself they moved it into row
[01:23:00] <seutje> meh, to each their own, I suppose
[01:23:30] <seutje> I don't even use row wrappers
[01:23:44] <seutje> these aren't tables, u know :P
[01:23:51] <trinadh> djQuery: ??
[01:24:08] <fat> trinadh: should i add the divs?
[01:24:12] <djQuery> u were complain about w3s
[01:24:25] <djQuery> was giving u amunition
[01:24:36] <djQuery> got them blocked from my search results
[01:24:42] <trinadh> lol, no am not complaininbg :)
[01:24:46] <dblosevn> gah whys everything go wrong for me lol

[01:29:48] <dblosevn> yay lol JQMIGRATE: jQuery.browser is deprecated

[01:30:02] <fattest> ra3or: what do u need
[01:30:10] <dblosevn> ive never used $.browser myself
[01:30:13] <RA3OR> im copying text from a textarea
[01:30:22] <RA3OR> and multiple lines are copied over as one big line
[01:30:28] <djQuery> dblosevn, thought they moved it to a plugin but I cant find anyting about it
[01:30:30] <fattest> ra3or: screenshot?
[01:30:37] <dblosevn> i dont believe in writing browser hacks with js
[01:30:51] <fattest> rideh: oi. about the buttons, are there sub menus tutorials to them?
[01:30:53] <RA3OR> fattest for what?
[01:30:56] <dblosevn> migrate worked just throws errors in the console
[01:31:14] <fattest> ra3or: screenshot them being copied voer one big line.
[01:31:18] <rideh> fattest: yeah did you even look at the bootstrap site?
[01:31:28] <fattest> rideh: lookingn ow
[01:31:40] <rideh> c'mon man at least look before you ask
[01:32:01] <rideh> thats just saying your time is more valuable than mine and asking for a favor at same time
[01:32:05] <fattest> rideh: oh i already looked at ur components
[01:32:12] <Meme> Hello
[01:32:13] <fattest> rideh: at the bootstrap components.
[01:32:23] <fattest> rideh: there is no button with a sub menu there, thats why im asking
[01:32:28] <Meme> Whats up with that .Click memory leak
[01:32:30] <rideh> what is this? http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/components.html#buttonDropdowns
[01:32:31] <djQuery> dblosevn, I believe there is a setting in migrate to turn off the console errors
[01:32:55] <djQuery> dblosevn, those errors get kinda annoying in ie6 if memory server correct
[01:33:00] <fattest> rideh: they haven o sub menu
[01:33:11] <fattest> rideh: i already looked there, i need sub menus
[01:33:16] <rideh> fattest:  what do you consider a sub menu, example?
[01:33:46] <fattest> rideh: looking now for an exzmple
[01:33:51] <MariusKarthaus> Hi, jquery hide() and show() functions have a 'step' option that allows me to hook my function into the animation. This option seems to be stripped in jquery-UI. How do I hook into the steps of the animation with jquery-ui hide()
[01:33:53] <rideh> fattest: i'd say with your level of skill, revise your plan until your execution abilities catch up a bit
[01:34:05] <fattest> rideh: http://jsfiddle.net/chadritchie/xgbJE/
[01:34:27] <fattest> rideh: put ur mouse over dropdown and u will see a 2 level menu
[01:34:37] <RA3OR> fattest: http://jsfiddle.net/QwKng/
[01:34:41] <RA3OR> makes any sense?
[01:34:59] <RA3OR> htmlentities or something
[01:35:03] <RA3OR> specialchars
[01:36:46] <dblosevn> RA3OR: after posting to your php script run nl2br on the field
[01:37:08] <dblosevn> $_POST['foo'] = nl2br($_POST['foo']);
[01:38:04] <RA3OR> dblosevn: right.....
[01:38:44] <RA3OR> anyway, figured it out, thanks: http://jsfiddle.net/QwKng/2/
[01:39:26] <RA3OR> dblosevn: the idea is to do a jquery post, not $_POST
[01:39:54] <RA3OR> and have a changes preview before posting
[01:40:12] <dblosevn> jquery will send it to the server just like it is in the textbox
[01:40:30] <dblosevn> its up to the server to handle it properly
[01:40:57] <RA3OR> dblosevn: you telling me about php on #jquery ? :D
[01:41:06] <rideh> fattest: got your answer here http://jsfiddle.net/QwKng/8/
[01:42:27] <RA3OR> rideh: troll
[01:42:32] <RA3OR> :)
[01:43:02] <rideh> not really,,
[01:44:59] <dblosevn> Well, i didnt realize you were trying to just display the contents on the page i assumed you were posting them to the server
[01:45:14] <dblosevn> you could have simply wrapped div foo in pre tags
[01:45:27] <pingec> Hmm why is jsfiddle so slow these days
[01:45:41] <rideh> i can give you a bookmarklet too: javascript:location.href='http://lmgtfy.com/?'+prompt('Enter Question Here')
[01:45:46] <rideh> pingec: was noticing that too
[01:46:03] <pingec> Is there a clone/alternative these days?
[01:46:33] <rideh> pingec: https://c9.io/ count?
[01:48:34] <rideh> pingec: dunno how current http://designshack.net/articles/css/5-online-playgrounds-for-html-css-and-javascript-compared/
[01:49:02] <dblosevn> RA3OR: http://jsfiddle.net/dwJV3/ like so
[01:49:36] <mandarks> hey guys, whats the correct way to unset all of jquerys inline css ?
[01:52:41] <rideh> dblosevn:  wont let me block w3schools.com for some reason
[01:52:45] <rideh> *google wont
[01:54:24] <dblosevn> rideh: why would you want to block w3schools.com ?
[01:54:42] <rideh> mabye it wasnt you saying it ealier, but its a garbage resource  :/
[01:55:09] <dblosevn> ?g -w3schools.com w3c html option
[01:55:09] <b-ot> dblosevn: HTML/Elements/option - W3C Wiki → http://www.w3.org/wiki/HTML/Elements/option
[01:55:26] <dblosevn> worked for me lol
[01:56:04] <rideh> dblosevn: was trying to block domain for queries from my account
[01:56:14] <rideh> not expliciatly in the query itself
[01:56:19] <dblosevn> oh got ya
[01:56:34] <rideh> added to block list but doesnt eem to work, though it seems to act funny with wildcards
[01:57:41] <rideh> basic question: if (req.body.calc_enabled.toLowerCase() == 'true') if calc_enabled isn't in the post at all will that get caught by an else? figure i need to explicitly say only if true or if false, if not specified to ignore
[01:57:47] <dblosevn> you try adding site:w3schoole.com
[01:58:02] <dblosevn> but spelling it correctly lol
[01:58:04] <rideh> i realize its not a jquery question exactly
[01:58:12] <rideh> lol :P,, w3schoold.
[01:59:15] <newbie69> hello
[01:59:19] <newbie69> guys pls i need help
[01:59:24] <dblosevn> rideh: if (undefined !== req.body.calc_enabled && req. ....
[01:59:34] <newbie69> first on how to submit a form from outside the form using js.
[01:59:51] <rideh> dblosevn: derp thanks
[01:59:56] <dblosevn> will trigger a fatal if you dont check if its defined and its not
[01:59:56] <newbie69> 1) using a link where i pass some additional params in the link...and call a function
[02:00:07] <newbie69> 2) where i just call form and pass data
[02:01:21] <rideh> dblosevn: is it more efficient to do both evaluations at once?
[02:01:51] <dblosevn> newbie69: <a href="#" id="link-id">Submit</a>
[02:02:02] <xhoy> hi there, i have a question, we have a $().click => hide(), but when we do that 20 times, it gets a bit slow. And it consumes a lot of memory
[02:02:15] <dblosevn> newbie69: $('#link-id').click(function() { $('#form-id').submit(); });
[02:02:18] <xhoy> (we hide it and replace the click event with another click event to show it again).
[02:02:51] <AdamPDotty> replace how?
[02:02:55] <xhoy> when we do $().unbind().click... this doesnt happen, wouldn't it be logical if jquery unbinded the 'old' click when a new click is set?
[02:03:20] <dblosevn> rideh: this is how i usually do it
[02:03:22] <xhoy> AdamPDotty: we do $().click... and then we do $().click again :)
[02:03:28] <dblosevn> rideh: if (undefined !== req.body.calc_enabled && req.body.calc_enabled.toLowerCase() == 'true')
[02:04:02] <AdamPDotty> there can be multiple click-events on an element
[02:04:15] <xhoy> but you can only click once?
[02:04:22] <AdamPDotty> and all get fired
[02:04:25] <rideh> dblosevn wasnt sure if it was more efficient to nest or not
[02:04:29] <xhoy> oooooooooooooooooow
[02:04:30] <xhoy> rly!
[02:04:37] <AdamPDotty> so if you keep addeing event listeners to document
[02:04:44] <xhoy> that is why it is so slow, its showing, hiding, showing, hiding
[02:04:54] <AdamPDotty> probably
[02:04:58] <xhoy> ah!
[02:05:02] <rideh> xhoy sometimes you might want more than 1 thing to happen with 1 event
[02:05:14] <xhoy> rideh: then you do that with the same click event?
[02:05:21] <xhoy> atleast that is what i would do then :)
[02:05:41] <dblosevn> xhoy: why would jquery unbind the click event just because you bound another one?
[02:05:45] <AdamPDotty> thats one common way
[02:05:58] <xhoy> dunno, feld logical :)
[02:06:00] <rideh> xhoy sometimes that doesnt make sense in the structure of the application
[02:06:03] <xhoy> never thought about it this way
[02:06:07] <dblosevn> xhoy: its pretty common to bind multiple listners to the same element
[02:06:23] <dblosevn> *to the same event
[02:06:33] <rideh> for instance, 1 will trigger animation, another will trigger a save and another will trigger updating some record field
[02:06:48] <xhoy> but that is the same event?
[02:07:05] <dblosevn> think domready should jquery clear all the domready listeners just because you added another one?
[02:07:06] <xhoy> but they can be added at serveral logications?
[02:07:17] <xhoy> dblosevn: no, we do that in a function
[02:07:20] <rideh> might not make sense to have a bunch of  thisOneSpecificButton.click() 's
[02:07:26] <xhoy> on click run hide_thing()
[02:08:02] <AdamPDotty> you can use a flag and then decide by that flag which function to call
[02:08:10] <AdamPDotty> or you can use on() and off()
[02:08:22] <rideh> xhoy you might make a new function showLoadingBar() that gets applied to every $('.slowWidget')
[02:08:29] <AdamPDotty> theres also toggle() for some uses
[02:08:33] <dblosevn> xhoy: sounds like you really are looking for event delegation, you should have a need to unbind and rebind the same listner to the same button
[02:08:45] <xhoy> https://gist.github.com/xhoy/4721594
[02:08:46] <dblosevn> *should not
[02:09:10] <xhoy> when we remove the unbind, it addes multiple events, as we did notice, but we tought that would be strange :)
[02:09:22] <rideh> dblosevn: actually sounds like a problem i'm having with accordian navigation persistence between pages on another project of mine
[02:09:35] <dblosevn> jqm?
[02:09:58] <rideh> dblosevn:  http://mkna.computersystemworks.com/directory/
[02:10:25] <rideh> it gets confused easily
[02:10:55] <dblosevn> oh i know nothing about bootstrap :-(
[02:11:34] <dblosevn> ive had that problem with jqm though multiple times
[02:11:50] <dblosevn> binding the same plugin repeatedly to the same elements
[02:12:19] <rideh> i ahvent had a chance to take another look at it, been back-burnered for a bit
[02:12:24] <dblosevn> eg everytime you go back to a page thats already been rendered
[02:13:06] <dblosevn> youll get it firing a click event multiple times
[02:13:32] <dblosevn> submitting forms countless times to the server etc
[02:14:10] <newbie69> dblosevn: thanks. would try any of that.
[02:14:29] <dblosevn> ?english @ newbie69
[02:15:05] <dblosevn> b-ot is always sleepin when i wanna play lol
[02:16:46] <juria_roberts> I have an iframe with a src attribute in my page.How do I prevent it from loading?
[02:17:03] <rideh> juria_roberts: dont use iframe
[02:17:11] <juria_roberts> rideh: I have to
[02:18:55] <pSouper> hi all, would anyone know how to change the text() of a child to $this. I have a list of a few of these… <li class="foo"><span class="bar">hello</li> and on 'click' would like to change the text of the span within the clicked '<li>' to 'world'
[02:19:20] <thisboy> http://home.no/reddvinylene/test/ -- Anybody know why this simple seamless fluid image Masonry (http://metafizzy.co/blog/beyonce-seamless-fluid-image-masonry/) crashes on mobile (AppleWebKit)?
[02:19:30] <pSouper> …I'm basically making an nav selector to show active
[02:22:26] <rideh> juria_roberts: got a link?
[02:23:28] <dblosevn> pSouper: $('li.foo').click(function() { this.find('span').html('world') });
[02:23:50] <pSouper> find! - bugger that thank you :) dblosevn
[02:24:10] <pSouper> i'm sure bugger that should have had a coma after too :D
[02:24:34] <dblosevn> ;
[02:24:38] <dblosevn> oops
[02:24:38] <rideh> man, my derps on this one are adding up
[02:25:20] <pSouper> i was stuck on a $(this+' span').html() type of thing
[02:25:21] <dblosevn> my code doesnt need any comas although i feel like i need a months sleep
[02:25:51] <rideh> so… wanna give yourself a headache? use a single checkbox for a boolean field then in the logic to determine if it should be pre-checked or not, also go ahead and change the value of it while you are at it…. so when its unchecked,,, checking it will be false, and unchecking it when true will be true…. cuz welll that makes sense right?
[02:26:09] <dblosevn> pSouper: could have also done... $('li.foo').click(function() { $('span', this).html('world') });
[02:26:31] <dblosevn> bout the same overhead
[02:26:59] <pSouper> thanks dblosevn - i'm way to green to know about overheads but it all sinks in.
[02:27:08] <juria_roberts> rideh: nope
[02:27:53] <dblosevn> my second example sets the context of jquery to `this` and starts its search from there
[02:28:34] <dblosevn> the first example does the same thing with an addtional function call, I tend to go with the first method though even with the addtional call as it is far clearer whats happening
[02:28:59] <dblosevn> @ pSouper
[02:29:13] <dblosevn> rideh: im way to tired to understand what you just said lmao
[02:29:35] <newbie69> hi dblosevn
[02:29:54] <rideh> dblosevn: yeah basically checking or unchecking it sets it to whatever value it currently has…. whichever way it is set…
[02:29:56] <pSouper> thnkas for your time and knowledge - i read/understand the second version as… give me the span within this and change the html - if right, this is as simple to use
[02:30:15] <dblosevn> rideh: checking or unchecking never changes the value of a checkbox...
[02:30:25] <rideh> that too ;)
[02:30:41] <dblosevn> rideh: it does however change the checked property
[02:31:08] <rideh> hm maybe thats the problem
[02:31:33] <dblosevn> if ($(this).prop('checked'))
[02:31:37] <rideh> in the put it shows the value being what i gave it as a value when checked, and nothing when unchecked.
[02:31:50] <rideh> how does it show in a post?
[02:32:06] <rideh> i'm looking at it and it simply shows its value, will it not post if its unchecked?
[02:32:10] <dblosevn> oh i have a hack to make it always show checked or not
[02:33:32] <dblosevn> rideh: http://html.chosd.com/48
[02:34:28] <rideh> like it, thanks
[02:35:04] <dblosevn> the way html forms work if 2 fields have the same name the one that comes last is the value sent to the server, in the case of a checkbox if a hidden field comes before the checkbox and the checkbox is unchecked the value of the hidden field is sent instead if it is checked the value of the checkbox is sent
[02:35:23] <newbie69> dblosevn: thanks...trying that now
[02:35:58] <dblosevn> newbie69: was unaware you asked a question
[02:36:00] <rideh> so unchecked checkboxes really are inert..
[02:36:16] <dblosevn> if a checkbox is unchecked its value is not sent to the server
[02:36:19] <rideh> dblosevn: some really basic stuff i have gaps
[02:36:54] <ximarin> hi all, question: I have an ajax call (call1) that receives an html page that also contains an ajax call (call2). call1 ends with a .done() that does a third ajax call (call3). call3 now needs call2 to be completed to work properly, but the order of execution is call1, call3, call2 instad of 1,2,3. How can I force call1.done(call3) to wait for call2 to be completed?
[02:37:14] <rideh> makes sense once i saw it, just didn't realize it didnt post at all, I thought my logic on the backend would grab it and handle it though: else if (undefined !== req.body.specialty || req.body.specialty.toLower == 'false')  note the OR instead of &&
[02:37:16] <dblosevn> when im lazy i test server side $calc_enabled = (isset($_POST['calc_enabled'])) ? true : false;
[02:37:50] <Cork> ximarin: $.when
[02:38:18] * Cork misses the bot...
[02:38:32] * dblosevn Does too :-(
[02:39:45] <ximarin> Cork: but what if call1 doesn't know there is a call2?
[02:40:01] <Cork> uh
[02:40:20] <ximarin> call1 creates a form, call2 fills a dropdown, call3 sets a preselected value on the dropdown
[02:40:21] <Cork> wait you call call1.done(call3) to start call1?
[02:40:57] <Cork> ximarin: you need to collect the deffered variables from call1 and call2 and use that for a $.when for call3
[02:42:06] <rideh> dblosevn:  lol of course in my situation the post shows specialty false and specialty true and it gets handled as {false,true} ....
[02:43:00] <Cork> rideh: then your using .peop('checked') instead of .val()
[02:43:08] <pingec> rideh: jsbin
[02:43:51] <rideh> lot of code here, mind you this is node on the backend
[02:44:57] <ximarin> Cork: I don't really know what you mean :( I set the async-option to false for these calls now, that works, but it's definitely not the best way to do it
[02:45:13] <Cork> ouch
[02:45:17] <Cork> that sucks big time
[02:45:37] <Cork> ximarin: could you jsfiddle your code?
[02:46:17] <ximarin> hm, not really as I need to have a second page loaded via ajax
[02:46:31] <ximarin> wait, I'll give it a try at least :D
[02:46:31] <juria_roberts> How do get an iframe by Id and prevent it from loading?
[02:46:32] <Cork> not to show the code flow
[02:47:06] <Cork> juria_roberts: by id is like any other element; and prevent from loading would be to set src to =""
[02:47:24] <Cork> though that is not garanteed to work
[02:47:26] <rideh> at this time i'd like to remind everyone why running queries directly on the database after being up for 24 hours is not a recommended action
[02:47:41] <juria_roberts> Cork: any other way like say using stop() ?
[02:47:48] <rideh> s/action/course of action
[02:47:49] <Cork> juria_roberts: nope
[02:49:12] <HankHendrix> how can I execute a function when an iframe has finished loading?
[02:49:41] <rideh> was my dev environment of course but still have to rebuild admin user and assign its ownership to all objects...
[02:50:48] <Cork> HankHendrix: you can bind its load event if the page is the same domain
[02:50:55] <juria_roberts> Cork: if i put src as blank the contents dissapear
[02:51:02] <Cork> juria_roberts: ya
[02:51:28] <juria_roberts> Cork: what i want is if there is content present to stop src url from loading
[02:51:43] <juria_roberts> Cork: otherwise it should load
[02:52:34] <Cork> juria_roberts: don't think you can
[02:53:07] <Cork> juria_roberts: is the iframe same domain?
[02:53:32] <HankHendrix> I'm  loading the bbc website into an iframe on my private site
[02:53:55] <ximarin> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/8RugE/5/
[02:54:03] <Cork> are those on the same domain ex, only different paths
[02:54:22] <ximarin> Cork: the html-part is the one that gets loaded by the first call
[02:54:23] <juria_roberts> Cork: same doamin different paths
[02:54:47] <ximarin> Cork: the js-part is the one that fires the first and the third call
[02:54:49] <Cork> juria_roberts: then you could try $('iframe')[0].contentWindow.stop()
[02:54:59] <Cork> juria_roberts: no garantees though
[02:55:03] <cuqa__> hi
[02:55:28] <juria_roberts> Cork: inplace of iframe should i put the id of the iframe?
[02:55:36] <Cork> yes
[02:56:00] <juria_roberts> Cork: ok will give it a try
[02:56:10] <cuqa__> question: http://jsfiddle.net/BsSSC/3/ .. when entering data into the inputs with placeholder and clicking okay the data should be displayed at the bottom, but I cant get them to display correctly. Just [Object Object] all the time
[02:56:14] <Cork> ximarin: theres only two ajax calls there as far as i can see
[02:56:47] <ximarin> Cork: the one I call call2 is in the html-section
[02:56:55] <Cork> cup: JSON.serialize(a)
[02:57:13] <ximarin> is just split them up so you can see what is in the two files
[02:57:23] <Cork> ouch so its embedded in the html
[02:57:29] <ximarin> jap
[02:57:42] <Cork> you can't
[02:57:53] <ximarin> aw crap -.-
[02:57:54] <Cork> there just arn't anyway to know
[02:58:07] <ximarin> guessed so too
[02:58:07] <Cork> you could have a global function that does the call3
[02:58:21] <Cork> and have the ajax response call that when its done
[02:58:25] <Cork> but other then that ....
[02:59:02] <ximarin> hmm, I think I will get rid of the problem anyway if I move the thing to jsp and have the dropdown prefilled anyway
[02:59:29] <Cork> window.form_load_fetch = function() { $.get() };  .......... or (var key in dropdownContent) { } window.form_load_fetch();
[02:59:42] <Cork> * for (var key in dropdownContent) { } window.form_load_fetch();
[03:01:40] <ximarin> I think I will have to do some redesign before moving on ;)
[03:01:52] <Kambfhase> cuqa__: http://jsfiddle.net/BsSSC/4/
[03:02:25] <newbie69> dblosevn: can i dynamically? in javascript add new parameters to a form for case of submission?
[03:02:30] <cuqa__> value.value wtf
[03:02:43] <cuqa__> but thanks alot. can you explain to me why value.value pls
[03:03:52] <Kambfhase> It seems like .serializeArray() turns your forms into JSON (kinda)
[03:03:53] <HankHendrix> $(el).load() - seems to work well
[03:04:03] <HankHendrix> but I don't think it fires when the content has finished loading
[03:04:18] <HankHendrix> i think it fires when the iframe element has loaded
[03:08:10] <Cork> Kambfhase: no serializeArray generates an array of objects
[03:08:34] <Kambfhase> whatever
[03:08:56] <Cork> opps i used the wrong nick when i answered before >_<
[03:09:21] <Kambfhase> :D
[03:09:37] <Cork> i meant WAY before <Cork> cup: JSON.serialize(a)
[03:09:41] <Cork> :/
[03:10:50] <Anticom2> hey Cork :)
[03:12:27] <Cork> o/
[03:14:22] <dblosevn> Cork: is JSON implemented by jquery or the browser?
[03:15:02] <Kambfhase> browser
[03:15:23] <dblosevn> Cork: dont know how many times I have needed a json serializer and had to search for one
[03:15:35] <Cork> dblosevn: browser
[03:15:51] <Cork> dblosevn: older ie's don't have one, but...
[03:16:01] <Cork> just load json2.js for those
[03:16:14] <dblosevn> I redirect IE visters to the chrome download page lol
[03:16:23] <Cork> O_o'
[03:16:28] <Cork> thats...
[03:16:46] <dblosevn> im totally kidding lol but dont think it hasnt crossed my mind lol
[03:17:08] <NoWired> I need to change the color to a differents parts of a map, I try to use the "jQuery maphilight" to make it, but I don't get any result with it
[03:17:09] <Anticom2> dblosevn however it isn't in older IE versions but for those there is a implementation in js https://github.com/douglascrockford/JSON-js
[03:17:23] <Cork> dblosevn: well i gave ie6 users a overlay with a link to chrometab :)
[03:17:28] <Cork> a while back
[03:17:31] <dblosevn> ie10 is almost a real browser though i have to give ms there props there at least making an attempt now
[03:17:31] <Anticom2> NoWired using it aswell... working just fine
[03:18:34] <dblosevn> about 10 years too late I fear though
[03:19:12] <Cork> ie10 is quite close, sad that so many users will not be able to use it
[03:19:16] <NoWired> I have this html code: http://pastebin.com/b7aREfge
[03:19:22] <grafi> [12:15:55] <dblosevn> I redirect IE visters to the chrome download page lol << sounds like a reasonable approach
[03:19:27] <Cork> its going ot take ages for ie8 to die
[03:19:27] <dblosevn> I dont cringe as much when i acidently open ie anymore
[03:19:36] <Cork> well not ie8, actually but ie9
[03:19:39] <NoWired> the file map2.jpg it's a spanish map, 500x350 pixels
[03:19:47] <Cork> ie8 hopefully dies with winxp
[03:20:02] <Cork> (only 2 more months!)
[03:20:35] <dblosevn> im suprised ms has supported xp this long
[03:20:42] <grafi> why?
[03:20:42] <disto> hello i want to have some free samples of slider or carousel. could you please gimme some url ?
[03:20:50] <NoWired> but when i put the mouse on the selected area, doesn't make anything
[03:21:03] <Cork> oh blah
[03:21:09] <Cork> it was 14 not 13 :s
[03:21:11] <dblosevn> 95,98,me, nt4 were all released within a year or two of xp and they quit supporting them years ago
[03:21:17] <Cork> oh well one more year
[03:21:40] <thirdknife> hi, is there any way in jquery i can bind iframe height change event with a function?
[03:21:42] <Cork> dblosevn: its mostly cause vista was such a flopp
[03:22:14] <dblosevn> 7 was pretty stable though
[03:22:15] <thirdknife> i have been working on this for a long and not found solution
[03:22:16] <Cork> thirdknife: you mean the height change of the content or of the frame it self?
[03:22:17] <grafi> and xp is a pretty good os, when you stop caring that its a m$ product :P
[03:22:27] <Cork> dblosevn: ya, but it took them ages to get there
[03:22:29] <thirdknife> yeah content, Cork
[03:22:39] <Cork> thirdknife: cross domain?
[03:22:44] <dblosevn> i think they did an awesome job with 8, i could loose the metro interface though
[03:22:46] <Cork> dblosevn: longhorn was delayed for years
[03:22:48] <thirdknife> yes
[03:23:04] <jaffipaffi> Hey guys. I have this list: http://jsfiddle.net/fZfGn/ with checkboxes. I want, that then you check one checkbox, all parent checkboxes is checked. Like if you click on Item 2.2.2, then Item 2.2 and Item 2 will be checked too.. Any ideas on how I can do that?
[03:23:11] <Cork> and when they finnaly gave up they tuck it back and got vista
[03:23:12] <grafi> dblosevn: wouildnt that just be win7 though? ^^
[03:23:31] <Cork> thirdknife: then no, impossible
[03:23:34] <NoWired> I think that when I have the mouse over the selected area, will change the color of this area, but only change the cursor ....
[03:23:42] <thirdknife> what if not cross domain then?
[03:23:45] <Cork> dblosevn: join the party http://mycountdown.org/fullpage.php?group=my%20countdown&countdown=My%20Countdown&widget_number=3015&text1=Windows%20XP%20End%20of%20Life&text2=If%20you%20need%20help%20with%20upgrading%20your%20hardware%20from%20Windows%20XP,%20give%20us%20a%20call!&timezone=GMT&event_time=1396310400&img=1&cp3_Hex=&cp2_Hex=FFFFFF&cp1_Hex=000000&hbg=0&fwdt=200
[03:23:47] <Cork> :)
[03:23:50] <dblosevn> Cork: I know I had the aplha beta all 3 rc's and the rtm for at least 2 years before they finally released it
[03:24:17] <Cork> thinced: if the content of the iframe is from another domain then the domain holding the main page
[03:24:21] <dblosevn> ie... longhorn aka 7
[03:24:27] <Cork> *thirdknife:
[03:24:34] <Cork> ya
[03:24:51] <disto> hello i want to have some free samples of slider or carousel. could you please gimme some url ?
[03:25:14] <thirdknife> any hints Cork, how to achieve that ?
[03:25:30] <Cork> thirdknife: is it cross domain?
[03:25:33] <dblosevn> ?g jcarousel @ distro
[03:25:33] <b-ot> distro: jCarousel - sorgalla.com → http://sorgalla.com/jcarousel/
[03:25:46] * dblosevn woohoo the bot woke up
[03:26:03] <disto> thanks a lot
[03:26:07] <Cork> thirdknife: if yes, you would have to find a security hole in the browsers, and exploit it inorder to access that data
[03:26:08] <grafi> waagh jsfiddle looks broken in my browser...
[03:26:09] <disto> may i ask another question ?
[03:26:21] <disto> what are the differences between javascript, ajax and jquery ?
[03:26:51] <thirdknife> earlier i said no, but suppose its not cross domain then how its done? Cork
[03:26:57] <Cork> disto: javascript is a language, jquery is a framework, and ajax is a way to send parts for updates
[03:27:01] <dblosevn> javascript is a language, jquery is a javascript framework, ajax is a method of communicating syncronously with the server without reloading the page
[03:27:07] <dblosevn> ?learn @ distro
[03:27:31] <Cork> thirdknife: you can bind an event listener on the contentWindow of the page in the iframe
[03:27:36] <dblosevn> guess the other bot isnt up lol
[03:27:38] <Cork> and trigger on resize
[03:27:41] <rideh> can i not change the value of a hidden input element with .val()?
[03:27:48] <Cork> yes
[03:28:01] <disto> Cork and dblosevn thanks a lot. and what is a framework ?
[03:28:04] <thirdknife> Cork, will it work cross browsers?
[03:28:04] * dblosevn sad other bot wake up
[03:28:14] <rideh> Cork: was that in response to me?
[03:28:24] <Cork> disto: its a set of code used to make it easier to write in a language
[03:28:27] <NoWired> I found the error, I use "poli" when it has to be "rect"
[03:28:58] <Cork> disto: like $('selector'). is a shorthand for doing document.selectorAll('selector') (with some compatibility wrappers)
[03:29:07] <dblosevn> *- syncronously +asyncronously
[03:29:26] <Cork> rideh: exactly :)
[03:29:35] <disto> $ <-- here means jquery right ?
[03:29:40] <Cork> yes
[03:29:47] <rideh> Cork: lol, so yes i can change it or no i cannot change it
[03:29:57] <Cork> uh...
[03:30:02] <Cork> missed the not in the question :x
[03:30:16] <Cork> $('input[type="hidden"]').val() works
[03:30:17] <dblosevn> rideh: just flip a coin
[03:30:25] <dblosevn> :-D
[03:30:37] <disto> which one is better ? framework coding or regular one ?
[03:30:41] <Cork> i should start to always answer questions in code :D
[03:30:58] <Cork> disto: if you know what your doing the pure ones are faster
[03:31:15] <Cork> but if your don't very good at it, the frameworks tend to help you get it fairly fast
[03:31:22] <dblosevn> Cork: run faster but require far more code to do the same things
[03:31:22] <Cork> (faster then you might be able on your own)
[03:31:31] <rideh> it isnt though… and it's firing the event, did some console logs, link to what i'm doing: http://dpaste.com/911065/
[03:31:35] <disto> I'm good at assembly. so
[03:31:45] <Cork> and it normally needs much less code to write or a framework then natively
[03:31:52] <Cork> but yes you need to load the framework
[03:32:00] <Kambfhase> JavaScript is WebAssembly
[03:32:13] <disto> is there any framework to regular code converter ?
[03:32:15] <dblosevn> Kambfhase: um... no
[03:32:55] <Kambfhase> dblosevn: http://www.hanselman.com/blog/JavaScriptIsAssemblyLanguageForTheWebSematicMarkupIsDeadCleanVsMachinecodedHTML.aspx
[03:33:28] <Cork> rideh: you don't have an id on that field
[03:33:33] <NoWired> is there any app that give the coords of a image, to create a area/map in JavaScript?, it's for doing something similar that: http://davidlynch.org/projects/maphilight/docs/demo_usa.html , the problem, is get the "coords" of the image ...
[03:33:36] <dblosevn> Kambfhase: javascript is too highlevel of a lanaguage to be assembly
[03:33:40] <rideh> Cork: goodnight
[03:33:42] <rideh> lol
[03:33:46] <Cork> :)
[03:34:55] <disto> cork is that true cork implanted baseball bat better ?
[03:34:55] <Kambfhase> NoWired: http://raphaeljs.com/
[03:35:26] <Cork> disto: what?
[03:35:31] <Cork> baseball?!?
[03:35:43] <Cork> Kambfhase++
[03:35:48] <Cork> i love that lib :)
[03:35:50] <NoWired> Kambfhase, thanks, I'm going to see it
[03:36:03] <Cork> and its charting companion is nice too
[03:36:15] <disto> Cork don't you have baseball in your country ?
[03:36:40] <Cork> disto: sure, but i don't understand what your talking about
[03:37:07] <Cork> NoWired: might want to have a look at http://g.raphaeljs.com/
[03:37:23] <Kambfhase> Baseball? Oh, yeah I watched that on sunday.
[03:37:29] <disto> if you remove some part of bat, i mean wooden part, and then implant the same size of cork it's rumoured better shots.
[03:37:58] <disto> search "corked bat" on youtube
[03:38:08] <Kambfhase> Dat SuperBowl is really the best Baseball event of the year
[03:38:11] <Cork> ha, now i get what your aiming at
[03:38:14] <Cork> "funny"
[03:38:56] <Trisox> omg :|
[03:39:12] <Trisox> wy me
[03:39:17] <Cork> ?
[03:39:28] <Trisox> just ripped out of my pants whe where trowing around with a juggeling ball and fooling around ect.. at the office
[03:39:40] <Trisox> made some kinda move and 20 cm long holl in the back of my jeans
[03:39:47] <Trisox> not funny
[03:39:48] <dblosevn> what kind of office you work at lol
[03:39:49] <Cork> heh
[03:40:01] <Trisox> well sometimes you got to have some fun
[03:40:13] <dblosevn> long as shes hot :-D
[03:40:20] <Cork> <_<
[03:40:45] <Trisox> no fysical contact at play
[03:40:50] <Trisox> and not that fooling around
[03:41:05] <dblosevn> aw wheres the fun in that :-(
[03:41:27] <Trisox> now i have to get back with public transportation also...
[03:41:36] <disto> hey guys, did you know anyone just knows how to put downloaded codes from web into design can make a lot of money in Turkish dijital agencies as a front-end developer? and has no idea about coding..
[03:41:57] <dblosevn> dont they have a rent a pants or something lol hell they got rent a everything else lmao
[03:42:05] <NoWired> Cork, Kambfhase, it's not exactly what I need, I see that the raphaeljs makes similar things that davidlynch, what I need, is something, that, given it an image, will give me the coords for generate the areas
[03:42:24] <Trisox> dblosevn: haha
[03:42:39] <Cork> NoWired: the point was that the later builds on the former
[03:42:49] <Cork> they are fundamentally the same
[03:43:01] <Cork> (and written by the same developer)
[03:43:25] <Cork> NoWired: and yes, pure raphael is very flexible
[03:43:33] <Cork> i've used it quite a bit
[03:43:54] <NoWired> Cork, yes, but I need something to get the coords, to can use this coords with one of this scripts (raphael or davidlynch)
[03:44:01] <dblosevn> Hey Cork: got a question thats a little out of my expertise and im going to have to answer some questions on it in a couple days
[03:44:16] <NoWired> for generate the areas for a specific map
[03:44:22] <NoWired> * to generate
[03:44:26] <Cork> NoWired: you can get the coordinates from raphael
[03:44:34] <Cork> that was kinda what i was saying...
[03:44:49] <dblosevn> What do I need to read up on to figure out how to plot pixels on a vector image of the world to drop lat lon markers
[03:45:02] <Cork> ouch
[03:45:11] <Cork> dblosevn: thought about just using google maps?
[03:45:13] <dblosevn> trig?
[03:45:16] <NoWired> Cork, my english is very bad, sorry, I'll see the raphael's documentation, thanks
[03:45:19] <dblosevn> need to be offline
[03:45:28] <disto> my english is very bad either.
[03:45:33] <disto> does anyone can speak TR ?
[03:45:34] <disto> lol
[03:45:43] <dblosevn> and they want to make the vector image
[03:45:48] <Cork> well you need to convert the long lat to pixel cordinates on the image
[03:45:48] <rideh> cork, dblosevn  thanks guys for the help tonight. mucked through it with A LOT of really really dumb mistakes but made it.
[03:46:01] <rideh> learned a lot too
[03:46:05] <Cork> dblosevn: i actually did that for a project, was loads of fun, but hard
[03:46:05] <dblosevn> rideh: :-) happens to the best of us and np
[03:46:40] <dblosevn> Cork: it only needs to be mildly acurate
[03:46:49] <Cork> dblosevn: exactly
[03:46:54] <dblosevn> long as im dropping the markers in the right country lmao
[03:47:06] <Cork> so you need to know the proportions of the map in the image
[03:47:11] <Cork> and then calculate the offset
[03:47:33] <rideh> hate doing rapid dev-> production pushes when i dont have real tests setup but…. its a really new system so whatcha going to do :)
[03:47:43] <dblosevn> its going to show makrers when people post on twitter and facebook in realtime and place them in the location they posted from
[03:48:19] <dblosevn> and for the offline machines it will use a cache from the last 24 hours
[03:49:05] <Trisox> dblosevn	long as im dropping the markers in the right country lmao  hahahaha
[03:49:09] <dblosevn> marketing ploy thats going in the under armour headquaters foyer
[03:49:56] <Cork> dblosevn: heres a portion of the code needed http://pastebin.com/qeufP6h1
[03:50:01] <dblosevn> show realtime buzz of people talking about there company and stuff, im psyched about the project i think its going to be a ton of fun
[03:50:46] <dblosevn> Cork: Awesome book marked for when I get there
[03:50:47] <disto> is there any halal code for web? lol
[03:51:44] <Trisox> buzz compliant ! like my colleague always says
[03:52:25] <dblosevn> super short deadline though looking like april :-(
[03:54:26] <Cork> anyway i'm off
[03:55:01] <dblosevn> peace bro, i need to get back to work anyways lol
[03:55:12] <Trisox> Cork: Cu .o/
[03:55:37] <Cork> o/
[04:04:57] <chee> so hi
[04:05:46] <chee> how about event.preventDefault()ing with submit in .on()?
[04:06:42] <chee> with like… $( 'body' ).on( 'submit', '.dynamically-inserted form', function( event ) { event.preventDefault(); })
[04:06:48] <chee> :(
[04:08:40] <Nancy2012> anyone can help me out… http://jsfiddle.net/8jPXb/18/
[04:09:16] <Nancy2012> just trying to select the ítem value from dropdown and open up a popup according to selected ítem value from dropdown
[04:09:20] <Kambfhase> chee: whats the issue?
[04:09:29] <Nancy2012> i have multi dropdown
[04:09:44] <Kambfhase> $.fancybox is not a function
[04:14:08] <Nancy2012> yes…
[04:15:29] <nFFF> With svg/canvas, if I draw an image from a .png file, does it recognize the transparante pixels? I need to draw a bunch of images on top of each other to create a bigger image, using .png with transparent bg's. Or is it better with .png's positionaed absolutlely on top of each other, and html maps?  Each non-transparent part of each image needs to be clickable, I can do it with html maps, but
[04:15:29] <nFFF> when a user clicks part of the image, a new image can be laoded in its place, which would require a new html map. If canvas or svg can handle this intrinsically could save some work..
[04:15:47] <brantje> How can i select all elements with a tittle attribute set?
[04:16:07] <brantje> *[tittle*=*] ? like that
[04:16:48] <Nancy2012> Kambfhase: Sorry but i need to know.. is it possible to pass the id value and selected ítem value from dropdown to the popup if i have multi dropdown ??
[04:19:23] <Kambfhase> brantje: [title]
[04:20:03] <Kambfhase> brantje: but you dont want to use "*[title]" that will be super slow
[04:21:09] <Kambfhase> Nancy2012: i guess, that should be possible
[04:21:25] <Nancy2012> thanks for it..
[04:21:30] <Nancy2012> but can i ask u how can i do it..
[04:21:49] <Nancy2012> if u can show me any example. actually, since morning i have been trying to figure it out
[04:21:51] <Nancy2012> but i couldnt
[04:23:54] <Kambfhase> please create a fiddle of what you have accomplished so far and I#ll dig into that
[04:24:18] <Anticom2> Kambfhase kind as always :)
[04:25:40] <Kambfhase> yeah? I think my english is rather rude
[04:27:02] <Nancy2012> Kambfhase: Can you please help me what i asked u earlier
[04:27:11] <Kambfhase> kk
[04:28:06] <Kambfhase> you have to call .fancybox() on an element! like $("#id").fancybox()
[04:29:26] <Nancy2012> #id ???
[04:29:37] <Nancy2012> form id ???

[04:31:00] <Nancy2012> ok..
[04:31:05] <Nancy2012> i m ttyring
[04:31:15] <Kambfhase> alert() is not a debugger
[04:31:25] <Kambfhase> TypeError: jQuery.paseJSON is not a function
[04:31:25] <MrTool> Nancy2012: what version of fancybox do you use!?
[04:32:01] <Nancy2012> Version 1.3.4
[04:32:27] <truedon> Kambfhase:  sorry I didn't know who to get this running in jsfiddle, how can I just parse the json there to see if it appends?
[04:32:49] <Kambfhase> you missed an `r` ;)
[04:32:57] <dblosevn> Kambfhase: jQuery.parseJSON
[04:33:42] <grafi> pase != parse ;)
[04:34:47] <truedon> Kambfhase:  ahh ha
[04:34:57] <Kambfhase> truedon: your <select> does not have an id.
[04:35:00] <Nancy2012> kambfhase: i have multi récords with same ID
[04:35:05] <Nancy2012> then it wouldnt work :(
[04:35:28] <liox_> I'm using the method ajax () to log in and create a session with PHP but only on the first run he's login is failing to log later when reload the page and try to log in again normally only when I close the browser and run the first time the session is not being created someone knows what might be the problem?
[04:35:38] <Kambfhase> Nancy2012: you shall never have elements with the same ID on one page
[04:35:40] <Nancy2012> i defined the ID(pop) of each select
[04:35:47] <truedon> Kambfhase:  thank you man, gone blind looking at this too long!! THANK YOU :)
[04:35:54] <grafi> truedon: and v.id is actually undefined ;) seems like it should be more along the lines of v.values[0].id
[04:36:00] <disto> hej guys. me and my girlfriend are gonna visit America next month. I need some information about that i couldn't find the answers on google. Who wants to help me please ?
[04:36:02] <Nancy2012> but i have multi récords with the same id and class
[04:36:06] <Nancy2012> that is my problem
[04:36:13] <truedon> grafi:  ok so what's the best way for me to loop it?
[04:36:27] <Nancy2012> if there is just one récord .. then i can pass id and and that is all
[04:36:29] <Kambfhase> disto: please create a fiddle for that.
[04:36:41] <Kambfhase> o.O
[04:36:45] <grafi> xD
[04:37:13] <Nancy2012> but in my case, i have multi dropdown with the same class and id ..
[04:37:16] <disto> Kambfhase what ?
[04:38:22] <grafi> truedon you can still loop like you are doing now but you will have to change v.id to v.values[0].id to actually find something in your object
[04:39:29] <MrTool> Nancy2012: Are you trying to open an fancybox with an iframe after i choose one option of the select box!?
[04:39:38] <Nancy2012> yes yes
[04:39:46] <Nancy2012> that is thing what i want...
[04:39:59] <MrTool> ok, than at first you had to change the .click event to an .change
[04:41:09] <truedon> grafi: ah ok, in my debug outputs I am getting the values set when parsed in my app but I will try that so for all of the results it will always be v.values[0].id i won't need to increment to v.value[1].id etc?
[04:42:00] <grafi> based on the structure of your json, no
[04:43:21] <j0nr> hello all. I am not very familiar with jQuery, but am trying to use some code that I need to alter. I am not sure how I need to alter it to suit my needs. If you look at this: http://www.jacquet80.eu/blog/post/2011/02/Display-GPX-tracks-using-Google-Maps-API  I need to change the 'url' to read a file which is outside my webroot, so its not a 'web URL as such, but a local filepath. Can I do this?
[04:44:12] <ahimsa> How should I use jquery's $.getJSON() so it would handle no connection properly? I'm loading data from a server running on localhost, but when I close the server I get a javascript error on that call. I have set the .error() function as instructed in http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getJSON/ but it doesn't fire.
[04:44:49] <Jee5us_w> j0nr - you could request a file from the server. That's basicly all you can do.
[04:45:05] <Jee5us_w> if I understand you correctly
[04:45:46] <Jee5us_w> jonr - but outside your webroot. Not really. Then the server must have jsonp or xdomain connections enabled.
[04:46:34] <Jee5us_w> the thing you could do is that you reffer to a script, that curls the website/file you need and returns it. Like piping.
[04:47:03] <ahimsa> My code is as such http://pastie.org/6078996
[04:48:12] <Jee5us_w> ahimsa - look indo the docs. the same link you gave has a different method. the first code example.
[04:48:18] <Jee5us_w> try this. you might get better results.
[04:48:20] <dblosevn> im lazy and beyond need of sleep, does jquery have a built in way of posting to an iframe and listening for the result? I can do it with pure js, just looking for a quick easy way to do it
[04:48:57] <dblosevn> same domain just posting files
[04:49:36] <Jee5us_w> dblosevn - posting to an iframe is quite tricky. The thing is that I have only managed to create an uploaded that I needed for a project, that listened for the iframe change event. Maybe you can work something with that.
[04:50:04] <Jee5us_w> dblosevn - check this out http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1003973/target-an-iframe-with-a-html-post-with-jquery
[04:50:06] <dblosevn> well the post is the easy part simply set your forms target to the name of the iframe
[04:50:23] <ahimsa> Jee5us_w: what do you mean?
[04:50:28] <dblosevn> binding to the domready event though is the tricky part i cant rememebr off my head how to do
[04:50:59] <Jee5us_w> are you sure you really need to post to the iframe. maybe there is a better solution.
[04:51:26] <dblosevn> well if i had time i could implement html5 uploads but i dont really have time
[04:51:30] <Jee5us_w> ahimsa - try to use ajax requests, because as I see you're trying to init a jsonp request.
[04:51:50] <ahimsa> Jee5us_w: I am using jsonp
[04:52:02] <dblosevn> oh that wasnt for me lol
[04:52:05] <Jee5us_w> dblosevn - how about qq-uploader? Works like a charm, good docs and easy to set up.
[04:52:23] <dblosevn> to conversations so much alike but so different at the same time
[04:52:30] <ahimsa> dblosevn: :)
[04:52:51] <ahimsa> What I'd like to do is so the user an error message if the request doesn't go through, for whatever reason.
[04:53:02] <dblosevn> ill check it out @ Jee5us_w
[04:53:30] <ahimsa> s/so/show/
[04:53:45] <Jee5us_w> dblosevn - https://github.com/valums/file-uploader . This is the right one.
[04:53:58] <dblosevn> ya already there
[04:55:31] <tankblergh> hi! Quick question, Is there any simple reason why " $('input').on('keydown', function() {}) " doesn't fire  on new text inputs, while " $('input[type=radio]').on('change', function () {}) " does work on new radiobutton inouts ?
[04:56:07] <dblosevn> Jee5us_w: `resume`!! seriously thats awesome
[04:57:04] <Jee5us_w> dblosevn - it's a really powerful tool that we have used for alot of projects and never has failed.
[04:59:22] <dblosevn> Jee5us_w: be nice if they threw a demo page in the repo though
[04:59:38] <dblosevn> i assume it has upload progress as well
[05:00:24] <nomenkun_> Hello! I am building widget and want to have defaults available to everyone to modify. So user can change defaults and then create widget itself which would use new defaults. It easy to do with inheritance but I should allow changing 1 option at a time too. Any ideas? :)
[05:00:31] <dblosevn> oh demo is in tests
[05:02:00] <nFFF> Can I draw an image using svg and ignroe transparent pixels
[05:04:34] <Kambfhase> svg does not have pixels
[05:08:01] <dblosevn> nFFF: im assuming your having a problem similar to this
[05:08:10] <dblosevn> ?g svg ignore transparent areas @ nFFF

[05:09:07] <truedon> I am using the plugin for Jquery - Chosen an all my drop downs have javascript:void(0) when I hover them, it adds it to the URL also. How can I prevent this?
[05:09:24] <ahimsa> So, any help with http://pastie.org/6078996 ?
[05:09:50] <dblosevn> truedon: hmm `your using the plugin for jquery`... I didnt realize there was only one...
[05:10:18] <truedon> dblosevn:  hehe the plugin 'chosen' - http://harvesthq.github.com/chosen/
[05:11:03] <dblosevn> truedon: thats sick
[05:11:12] <truedon> dblosevn:  if only it worked
[05:11:36] <truedon> dblosevn:  It's been a buggy ride, but I got it working quiet nice just a last few issues now with my code
[05:12:08] <dblosevn> truedon: im not sure if i understand your problem can you show me an example, brb
[05:13:06] <truedon> dblosevn:  i don't know if u can view my local because of my lame isp but basically I have added an event to check the chosen on change an its working just when I click the drop down now it adds javascript:void(0) to the end of the url which i do not want to happen, how can I prevent it?
[05:14:56] <MrTool> ahimsa: could please create an jsfiddle with an correct url variable
[05:15:04] <MrTool> +you+
[05:16:19] <ahimsa> MrTool: since the server is atm running on localhost, I can't give you an url that would actually work, sorry :/
[05:17:14] <MrTool> ok than why  you are appending callback? ist this an crossdomain request?
[05:17:22] <ahimsa> The question is rather simple, or so I would think: how to detect and handle network error when using jsonp?
[05:17:23] <MrTool> and wich jquery version you use?
[05:17:27] <ahimsa> MrTool: yes, eventually it will be
[05:17:53] <ahimsa> I seem to have 1.8.2, perhaps I should upgrade.
[05:18:03] <dblosevn> truedon: return false or event.stopPropagation()
[05:18:16] <truedon> dblosevn:  thank you sir! :)
[05:18:51] <dblosevn> wow thattl wake you up just went outside in my boxers and a tshirt in minnesota
[05:19:03] <MrTool> i only need that info for the jqxhr function
[05:19:13] <dblosevn> ill definitely be glad when this jobs over and im back in warm florida
[05:19:47] <Trisox> haha dblosevn
[05:20:07] <dblosevn> 20 degress an shit snow everywhere, not the oppurtune weather for a smoke
[05:20:23] <Trisox> agreed its bit snow here
[05:20:25] <Trisox> almost gone
[05:20:34] <Trisox> ah there in usa
[05:20:35] <grafi> perfect conditions to stop smoking dblosevn
[05:20:42] <truedon> dblosevn: its still showing in the url, I tried return false and event.stopPropagation
[05:20:58] <dblosevn> still coming down, i was supossed to fly back yesterday but im behind so i had to extend another week
[05:21:07] <Trisox> only been in wisconsin and illinois
[05:21:15] <dblosevn> ?demo @ truedon
[05:21:15] <b-ot> truedon: Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[05:21:26] <truedon> dblosevn:  ok mate sure
[05:21:29] <Trisox> between greenbay and chicago :)
[05:21:40] <truedon> I think it's some other function from my friend, f@@kin guy didnt test
[05:21:59] <dblosevn> mirc is pissing me off, lost all my settings and scripts
[05:22:01] <MrTool> ahimsa: maybe you should use this one for ajax calls
[05:22:01] <MrTool> http://pastebin.com/wvQNu60M
[05:22:43] <dblosevn> used to ding at me when someone said my name, not do my autojoins until i was indentified etc auto message peops that pmd me
[05:22:44] <Trisox> dblosevn
[05:22:45] <Trisox> where in florida you living?
[05:22:52] <dblosevn> sebring/avon park
[05:23:04] <dblosevn> bout 80 miles south of orlando
[05:23:13] <ahimsa> MrTool: thanks, I'll test it. How do I indclude data to be sent to the server in that kind of request? Now I just append it to the url like "url + '&variable=data'".
[05:23:16] <MrTool> on server side you could check if an callback parameter is given and wrap the response in it, so you dont get any problems if it is crossdomain or not
[05:23:49] <Trisox> dblosevn: ah cool
[05:24:05] <MrTool> ahimsa: there will be your answer:  http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[05:25:49] <nFFF> Anyone here know if canvas would be faster then html maps when dealing with transparent pixels?
[05:28:51] <dblosevn> grr, i cqant remember the name of this awesome jquery plugin i used in the past
[05:29:20] <dblosevn> I need a sortable editable grid and i dont have the patience for ext right now
[05:29:36] <ahimsa> MrTool: alas, the results seem to be similar even with that code, and the part inside the .always(){} never get called (I put a console.log there).
[05:29:51] <dblosevn> preferably that will build it self off of a table
[05:31:01] <dblosevn> oh and by sortable i dont mean the column headers, i mean being able to drag and drop a row to order it
[05:33:23] <Tsd_> hi @ all
[05:33:35] <ahimsa> MrTool: my chrome seems to think even localhost:8080 is crossdomain, so that's all I've ever worked with with this :)
[05:35:18] <dblosevn> ahimsa: what is the url in your browser?
[05:35:50] <dblosevn> ahimsa: eg if your browser is pointed @ 127.0.0.1:8080 and your request is made to localhost:8080 it is crossdomain
[05:35:53] <Tsd_> Do anybody know whats going wrong while dynamical putting jquery-mobile content into a page when this error message appears?  Error: cannot call methods on loader prior to initialization; attempted to call method 'hide'
[05:36:15] <ahimsa> dblosevn: yes
[05:37:17] <dblosevn> also localhost and localhost:8080 are different domains
[05:37:57] <dblosevn> domain and port have to be the same in the browser as the request or you need to use jsonp or a proxy script on the server
[05:39:03] <ahimsa> dblosevn: that is true, and it's neither the issue nor the question :)
[05:39:50] <ahimsa> dblosevn: my question is, how should I use ajax/getjson so that I get an error that I can show to the user when the url is not available
[05:40:13] <ahimsa> In a way that is compatible with crossdomain jsonp.
[05:40:27] <dblosevn> ahimsa: my chrome seems to think even localhost:8080 is crossdomain, `that would only happen if your browser was pointed at a different port or domain`
[05:40:44] <dblosevn> well you can detect the failure
[05:42:04] <nFFF> http://jsfiddle.net/Zknt9/2/ anyone know why the map area isn;t being recognized?
[05:42:17] <MrTool> ahimsa: im working with this kind of ajax calls on a touchscreen terminal @ trainstations to check if currently is an interent connection is available. the jqXHR parameter contains all needed informations with the status code
[05:42:55] <shayne> hey all, I am having an issue. I was wondering if someone coule help me out with it
[05:43:09] <dblosevn> $.ajax({......, error: function (jqXHR, status, errorText) { //dostuuf }});
[05:43:16] <dblosevn> @ ahimsa
[05:43:31] <Kambfhase> shayne just ask
[05:43:33] <dblosevn> ? $.ajax @ ahimsa
[05:43:40] <MrTool> dont use .error, use .fail instead cause .error is deprecated since 1.8
[05:44:08] <shayne> this is my code http://paste.ee/p/OOrVA and the problem is that nothing is being filled into the div. The page it is calling just says "<p>test (pagename)</p>" but nothing happens
[05:45:10] <dblosevn> MrTool: hmm the docs didnt mention that, said it added functionality in 1.5 though
[05:45:29] <ahimsa> dblosevn: it was mentioned in the .ajax doc I think, or some place
[05:45:31] <dblosevn> MrTool: As of jQuery 1.5, the error setting can accept an array of functions. Each function will be called in turn. Note: This handler is not called for cross-domain script and JSONP requests. This is an Ajax Event
[05:45:58] <dblosevn> oh thats the difference, dont work with jsonp
[05:46:03] <ahimsa> But I saw it too, that .error is deprecated. No in the first place I looked though.
[05:46:05] <ahimsa> :)
[05:46:37] <dblosevn> well .fail uses the same parmeters
[05:49:03] <MrTool> thats very strange cause i use ajax.always for crossodmain requests in my tracking system
[05:49:09] <MrTool> and it work perfect
[05:49:51] <the_dark_knight> Hi, any good demo examples on editing the <td> of the <table> with jquery. Editing <td> will call controller which will call a model (mvc) and model will update into my db. So basically a field from the table of my db will be updated. Any good jsfiddle examples will be great help.
[05:49:52] <ahimsa> Anyway, this http://pastie.org/6079332 works as long as the server is online. But as soon as I put it offline, all I get is a red "GET" related error in Chrome's debug console.
[05:50:04] <dblosevn> ahimsa: oh this is even nicer http://api.jquery.com/deferred.fail/ looks cleaner anyways
[05:51:18] <shayne> this is my code http://paste.ee/p/OOrVA and the problem is that nothing is being filled into the div. The page it is calling just says "<p>test (pagename)</p>" but nothing happens <-- the .click
[05:51:36] <MrTool> i had following additional line in my code "jQuery.support.cors=true" but i dont have any idea what this thing does
[05:51:52] <shayne> i've ran an alert(webpage) and it shows the correct name. what is my issue
[05:51:59] <dblosevn> MrTool: it likely enables cors lol
[05:52:20] <dblosevn> the server your connecting to has to support cors though
[05:52:21] <MrTool> ^^ i only know that this has something to do with xmlhttp requests
[05:52:36] <ahimsa> :)
[05:52:41] <dblosevn> ?g CORS cross domain requests @ MrTool
[05:52:41] <b-ot> MrTool: Cross-origin resource sharing - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia → http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing
[05:52:48] <fRAiLtY-> Is this a standard JSON feed? http://s.trustpilot.com.s3-external-3.amazonaws.com/tpelements/246713/f.jsonp
[05:53:12] <ahimsa> Well, I'm using google's app engine for the server so if I can enable cors on it that's no problem (to me).
[05:53:17] <dblosevn> fRAiLtY-: looks like  valid jsonp to me
[05:53:31] <fRAiLtY-> Is there a difference between JSON and JSONp as regards accessing it?
[05:53:36] <fRAiLtY-> I've never done it before so am gonna have a go
[05:53:38] <dblosevn> ahimsa: you cant enable cors google would have to
[05:53:57] <dblosevn> which they may have done
[05:54:06] <MrTool> b-ot: thank you :)
[05:54:32] <shayne> any chance of me getting any help? I think it is something really simple
[05:55:51] <ahimsa> MrTool: even with that support.cors=true line all I get is the chrome's error message when my server is offline. When it's online everything works, but that was never an issue. What I wanted was the ability to tell when the server is unreachable so I can show that to the user. :)
[05:56:34] <AdamPDotty> shayne: what do you expect .text() to do?
[05:56:39] <dblosevn> shayne: try .load('./' + webpage);
[05:56:55] <dblosevn> ahimsa: whats the error?
[05:57:42] <dblosevn> also what type of request is it eg... get, post options etc
[05:58:02] <thaifood> When I click on <h3 id="nest1_acc_rpts_contacts"> on line 17, how can I return the id of parent in line 1 please? http://fpaste.org/QHmd/
[05:58:27] <AdamPDotty> ah missed a line
[05:58:34] <ahimsa> dblosevn: wait a second
[05:58:51] <dblosevn> shayne: your markup is invalid <a> is not allowed to be a child of ul
[05:58:57] <shayne> i'll give it a shot, it is in the same dir as the file tho. I'll report what happens.
[05:59:36] <AdamPDotty> taifood: also invalid h3 inside h3
[05:59:57] <shayne> nope, didn't work
[06:00:02] <AdamPDotty> still: .closest('h3')
[06:00:03] <dblosevn> read above
[06:00:08] <shayne> any other suggestions?
[06:00:13] <Kambfhase> AdamPDotty: look harder
[06:00:26] <thaifood> AdamPDotty,  what is invalid please ?
[06:00:31] <AdamPDotty> ah not really inside
[06:00:47] <AdamPDotty> it looks at least, as the first heading is for the parent div
[06:00:54] <Kambfhase> $(this).parent().parent().prev().attr("id")
[06:00:57] <dblosevn> shayne: your markup should be <ul><li><a>text</a></li> although id get rid of the a altogether and just set the cursor property
[06:01:09] <MrTool> ahimsa: i wrote an jquery ajax call which checks if an image on my webserver is available. maybe this could help you but i need a second to find it ^^
[06:01:25] <AdamPDotty> then the childdiv have a h3 too
[06:01:31] <AdamPDotty> not logical
[06:02:35] <MrTool> ahimsa: http://jsfiddle.net/zUAkp/
[06:02:37] <ahimsa> Ok, dblosevn & MrTool: I have code like this http://pastie.org/6079366 and it works fine when my server at the url is online. When I put it offline, all I get in the debug console is this https://dl.dropbox.com/u/1882289/js_error.jpg
[06:03:53] <shayne> ok, I fixed the markup and removed the <a> and used css cursor:pointer... but it still isn't working.
[06:04:03] <dblosevn> shayne: give me a minute
[06:04:04] <Tsd_> nobody here who knows someting about it??
[06:04:13] <Tsd_> maybe the mistake is in my view
[06:04:17] <shayne> alright, thanks
[06:04:28] <Tsd_> i doesn't get a dereffer "done"
[06:05:21] <fRAiLtY-> How to be able to access my jsonp feed, http://jsfiddle.net/fRAiLtY/Sf9hD/3/
[06:05:28] <fRAiLtY-> First time I've worked with this
[06:05:36] <fRAiLtY-> Is it like a php array?
[06:06:21] <ahimsa> fRAiLtY-: probably like result.<variable>
[06:06:25] <shayne> ok, it works now... it just needed to be uploaded to a server for some reason
[06:06:31] <AdamPDotty> hehe fine
[06:06:33] <shayne> it wasn't working on my local machine
[06:06:36] <ahimsa> fRAiLtY-: that is, if you're returning json data
[06:06:55] <MrTool> ahimsa: could you show us the headers from the network tab!?
[06:07:00] <fRAiLtY-> jsonp
[06:07:07] <fRAiLtY-> It's been verified as ok
[06:07:12] <AdamPDotty> shayne: are you sure about the cases?
[06:07:22] <shayne> it works now
[06:07:24] <shayne> adam
[06:07:34] <AdamPDotty> well, on one server
[06:07:37] <shayne> I needed to put it on the server
[06:08:05] <ahimsa> MrTool: sorry, where do I find those?
[06:08:36] <dblosevn> shayne: http://jsbin.com/uvulob/1/edit
[06:08:50] <ahimsa> MrTool: http://pastie.org/6079420

[06:09:06] <dblosevn> that is a little cleaner and should work perfectly also givevs you a little more control over the urls
[06:09:09] <thaifood> Kambfhase,   i tried  console.log(  $(this).parent().parent().prev().attr("'" + event.target.id + "'")  );   but i just get undefined returned
[06:09:46] <dblosevn> shayne: you cant make an ajax request from a file:// url thats why it had to be uploaded
[06:09:53] <nFFF> http://jsfiddle.net/Zknt9/2/ anyone know why the map area isn;t being recognized?
[06:09:53] <MrTool> can you see my image!?
[06:10:13] <Raydiation> how do you run unittests?
[06:10:30] <Raydiation> special url?
[06:10:35] <ahimsa> MrTool: http://pastie.org/6079425
[06:10:50] <ahimsa> MrTool: I could, but since the request failed - as the server is offline - there's no response headers :)
[06:11:24] <dblosevn> ahimsa: weird it appears to be missing the error
[06:12:11] <fRAiLtY-> http://jsfiddle.net/fRAiLtY/Sf9hD/4/ Why do I get trustpilot_jsonp_callback is not defined? that url is supplied by Trustpilot to us?
[06:12:41] <ahimsa> dblosevn: that's all my chrome's network tab shows for this particular request when I click it. In the request list it has (failed) as Status
[06:13:04] <dblosevn> ahimsa: have you tried the complete callback?
[06:13:24] <dblosevn> ahimsa: ) object and a string categorizing the status of the request ("success", "notmodified", "error", "timeout", "abort", or "parsererror")
[06:13:50] <dblosevn> supossedly complete will tell you if it timed out
[06:14:15] <ahimsa> dblosevn: the problem is, whatever code I have, when the server is offline all I get is https://dl.dropbox.com/u/1882289/js_error.jpg
[06:15:01] <dblosevn> ahimsa: well you will get the error no matter what you do but jquery should be able to fire a callback when the error occurs
[06:15:15] <ahimsa> So the code inside .always, .fail, .complete, .done or whatever never gets accessed. If that's what you meant.
[06:15:19] <dblosevn> theres no way to suppress that from the console
[06:15:24] <ahimsa> or at least I couldn't get them to.
[06:16:43] <thaifood> When I click on <h3 id="nest1_acc_rpts_contacts"> on line 17, how can I return the id of parent in line 1 please? http://fpaste.org/QHmd/   I'm using event.target.id  to return the id clicked
[06:16:59] <thedemonkilla> I'm looking for some help with the keydown event
[06:17:11] <thedemonkilla> I feel like I don't understand the process well enough
[06:17:21] <ahimsa> dblosevn: would you mind showing me an example of code that you think *should* work, I mean a callback that should fire when I get that error?
[06:18:06] <thedemonkilla> I have an onscreen keyboard that is intended to function like a physical keyboard, but I can't replicate the arrow keys
[06:18:31] <dblosevn> $.get('localhost:8080').fail(function() { console.log('failure'); });
[06:19:46] <gvo> I've just beat my head against the wall for an hour.  I had a form text field with an id of "home"  It's the only thing on the page with that id, however, $("#home").val('xxx'); didn't set the value.  Is there something special about an ID of home?
[06:20:11] <dblosevn> gvo: are you doing this in a domready listener?
[06:20:30] <gvo> Define domready listener.
[06:20:39] <dblosevn> gvo: eg... $(function() { or $(document).ready(function() {
[06:20:44] <gvo> It is in the "ready" yes.
[06:21:00] <the_dark_knight> Hi, I have a table containing 5 columns. I have data-id of <tr> how do I set value for third <td> using this data-id? please help
[06:21:03] <dblosevn> is #home rendered with ajax?
[06:21:32] <dblosevn> or dynamically I should say
[06:21:59] <gvo> I'm populating about 15 different form entries with the exact same format as shown in the first post.  The data did come from a call, yes.  I'm in the success function at the time of the failure.
[06:22:21] <thaifood> So how can i simply get the ID of the <h3> that is the immediate parent please ?
[06:22:45] <MrTool> ahimsa: sry but my boss need my help i had to work -.-
[06:22:48] <thaifood> I tried  $(this).closest("h3")   but it seems to dump an object
[06:22:49] <gvo> dblosevn: I changed the name to homephone and all works fine.
[06:22:51] <dblosevn> ?demo @gvo
[06:22:51] <b-ot> gvo: Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[06:23:14] <ahimsa> dblosevn: ok, that seemed to work. But how do I utilize that fail() thing with $.ajax or $.getJSON? Just adding it to those didn't seem to work.
[06:23:31] <dblosevn> theres nothing stopping you from using the id #home
[06:23:37] <dblosevn> ahimsa: same way
[06:23:39] <ahimsa> MrTool: no probms, thanks for the help. I didn't have time yet to look into your image script but I'll see about that.
[06:23:44] <gvo> dblosevn: I'll try but I suspect it might be something I'm doing but don't see.
[06:24:15] <dblosevn> ahimsa: $.ajax({...}).fail(function(jQXHR, status, error) { });
[06:25:19] <ahimsa> dblosevn: so what's wrong with this http://pastie.org/6079506 since it doesn't work (ie. the console.log doesn't print anything to console)?
[06:25:51] <dblosevn> ahimsa: remove your error listener
[06:26:18] <dblosevn> ahimsa: its likely stopping the deferred fail from firing
[06:27:18] <ahimsa> Still nothing http://pastie.org/6079523
[06:27:28] <thaifood> I tried  $("nest1_acc_rpts_sites").closest("h3").attr("id")     but it's not returning the id of the parent h3.  How can I get the ID of the parent <h3>
[06:28:01] <ahimsa> Not even if I remove the success.
[06:29:14] <dblosevn> ahimsa: http://ahimsa.chosd.com/49
[06:29:15] <niix> Which is recommended? Using the .css method to change style or using .addClass?
[06:29:17] <dblosevn> try that
[06:29:31] <tlkr> niix, they do different things.
[06:29:53] <niix> tlkr: Right, I understand that but I can accomplish the same thing with both methods
[06:30:40] <tlkr> classes are more efficient when there is repeated styles
[06:30:47] <niix> tlkr: Ok thanks :)
[06:33:11] <thaifood> I get what's clicked with  "event.target.id".  From that, how can I get the ID of the parent <h3> please ?
[06:33:17] <nFFF> Anyone here familair with html canvas?
[06:33:37] <gvo> dblosevn: It doesn't fail in a simple jsfiddle test.
[06:33:46] <ahimsa> dblosevn: even after fixing the typos, still same result. No alerts, no console log.
[06:34:19] <the_dark_knight> Hi, how do I solve this - http://jsfiddle.net/hussaintamboli/U9b2u/
[06:34:35] <dblosevn> ahimsa: but it works with $.get ... weird
[06:34:50] <ahimsa> Yeah.
[06:34:55] <dblosevn> $.get is just a shortcut function for $.ajax
[06:35:40] <dblosevn> ahimsa: http://ahimsa.chosd.com/50 try that
[06:35:42] <niix> Any benefits or consequences between either of these? http://hastebin.com/hiqarogera.js
[06:36:17] <p3lim> I need some basic guidance in a script I want to add, I currently have the path as if css was going to use it, and the idea of what to do with it
[06:36:18] <ahimsa> dblosevn: oh, with get I also get the access-control error that's related to the crossdomain request (which get is not)
[06:36:35] <ahimsa> the basic get, that is
[06:36:40] <ahimsa> I'll try that new code now
[06:37:20] <p3lim> If anyone minds helping me for a minute or two, that would be great (it's probably quite straight-forward anyways)
[06:38:01] <ahimsa> dblosevn: now I get "MLHttpRequest cannot load http://localhost:8080/roboz/get?crossdomain=true&dataType=jsonp&type=GET. Origin null is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Origin." and the "ajax failure" error log.
[06:38:18] <dblosevn> orgin null?
[06:38:29] <gvo> p3lim you need to give us a bit more info, your first post doesn't make a lot of sense to me.
[06:38:40] <ahimsa> Oh, wait.
[06:38:41] <p3lim> Basically I want to replace the href value from the links in google reader with the text within it
[06:38:43] <dblosevn> are you initalizing url with a value?
[06:39:06] <p3lim> The path beeing (as I would use it in css) is this: #current-entry .entry-container .entry-body a
[06:39:55] <dblosevn> Im unsure of what jquery would do if url were undefined lol
[06:39:55] <ahimsa> dblosevn: I am, but I had the server online by accident. :) Now when I put it offline, I get the same GET-error as before + this error ajax error -log. So it kind of works. Now if I can just make it work when the server is online I'll be happy. :)
[06:40:06] <p3lim> Reason is that most of the links does not work because it just points to a void function, and does nothing with the link
[06:40:33] <dblosevn> hmm
[06:41:28] <gvo> Without knowing much about your stituation, it appears you might know the ID.  So if that's true $("#current-entry") would address the element with that id.
[06:41:56] <ahimsa> Perhaps this MLHttpRequest error is related to the whole crossdomain thing?
[06:41:56] <dblosevn> ahimsa: http://ahimsa.chosd.com/51 try that
[06:42:11] <dblosevn> oh wait
[06:42:14] <gvo> And often when a link is to a void, the action is handled in a script somewhrere.
[06:42:18] <p3lim> I know how to get the first class or id, but I don't know how to proceed further down the tree
[06:42:30] <p3lim> I know it should, but it doesn't do anything
[06:42:36] <p3lim> That's what I want to fix
[06:42:39] <gvo> p3lim: what browser?
[06:42:42] <p3lim> chrome
[06:42:49] <Nisse> Hello
[06:43:01] <gvo> p3lim: bring up the debugger.
[06:43:20] <gvo> p3lim: It will let you drill down into most anything.
[06:43:24] <p3lim> Nothing in the debugger
[06:43:32] <gvo> Refresh
[06:43:34] <Nisse> I'm trying to prevent images from loading when loading a gallery via ajax. Any suggestions what approach to take? I tried changing the node names but that was harder than thought.
[06:43:39] <p3lim> I've tried that already
[06:44:00] <gvo> Nothing in the debugger?  Do you have it enabled?
[06:44:01] <ahimsa> dblosevn: alas, that new thing doesn't work when the server is offline :)
[06:44:04] <p3lim> Yes
[06:44:10] <p3lim> No errors or anything
[06:44:13] <the_dark_knight> Hi, how do I solve this - http://jsfiddle.net/hussaintamboli/U9b2u/ . please help me. I have been asking this for a long time.
[06:44:33] <gvo> p3lim as far as I know that's not possible.  :)
[06:44:54] <p3lim> Only some debugging prints and an error with some embedded google+ plugin
[06:45:06] <p3lim> If I replace the link manually it works
[06:45:13] <p3lim> Which is what I want the script to do
[06:45:15] <gvo> Along the top are little images.  Click on the elements.
[06:45:32] <p3lim> I've browsed the html structure
[06:45:39] <gvo> OK
[06:46:01] <dblosevn> ahimsa: ah ha... figured it out
[06:46:14] <gvo> What kind of an element is $("#current-entry") ?
[06:46:32] <ahimsa> dblosevn: do tell :)
[06:46:42] <p3lim> Want me to list the whole path?
[06:46:48] <ries> hello! what does this mean? $this.is('[href*="#"]')
[06:46:48] <p3lim> It's a div
[06:46:48] <dblosevn> ahimsa: thoughs events arent firing because, the request is not ajax, and im not entirely positive you can trap them
[06:46:59] <gvo> an href in a div?
[06:47:09] <p3lim> No
[06:47:29] <ahimsa> dblosevn: they're not ajax, even if you call them using .ajax or .get?
[06:47:32] <p3lim> The complete path is this: #current-entry .entry-container .entry-body a
[06:47:43] <p3lim> For getting each individual link of this kind
[06:47:45] <dblosevn> ahimsa: a jsonp request does not use the xhr object, it injects a script tag in the head and waits for a callback function to be fired
[06:47:51] <p3lim> (since the RSS feed has multiple)
[06:47:53] <gvo> so I assume  it's an "a" element?
[06:47:56] <p3lim> Yes
[06:48:02] <gvo> Does it have an id?
[06:48:09] <ahimsa> dblosevn: right, is there any workaround to detect an error with the request when using jsonp?
[06:48:13] <p3lim> No
[06:48:36] <dblosevn> ahimsa: im thinking not, unless theres some global document .error that i dont know about
[06:48:46] <ahimsa> Bummer. :/
[06:49:02] <p3lim> One sec I'll fiddle a basic structure up
[06:49:06] <gvo> OK
[06:49:08] <ahimsa> dblosevn: Any suggestions what I should do?
[06:50:10] <gvo> p3lim you probably want http://api.jquery.com/replaceWith/
[06:51:20] <dblosevn> ahimsa: hmm i wonder
[06:51:26] <nFFF> anyone ever used kinetic.js?
[06:52:38] <lx4r> Hello every one :-)
[06:53:11] <dblosevn> ahimsa: I wonder if you could delegate an  error listener on script tags :-)
[06:53:29] <ahimsa> :)
[06:53:52] <Consolas> hey everyone
[06:53:53] <p3lim> Wow fiddle is slow today
[06:53:59] <philhutchinson> its always slow for me
[06:54:00] <ahimsa> or perhaps I'll just let it fail silently, it's not the end of the world. Would've been nice to have some kind of error handler though. :)
[06:54:08] <dblosevn> every thrid wednesday it is
[06:54:43] <p3lim> gvo: http://jsfiddle.net/fzEpE/
[06:54:45] <dblosevn> ahimsa: you could always set a timeout listener
[06:54:47] <Consolas> I have this $(element).bind("change",function etc etc. When changing the listbox value, it gets executed. However, when changing the listbox value  from another jquery function, the bind("change") doesn't get "called". any way around this ?
[06:54:55] <dblosevn> well not really a listener
[06:54:59] <dblosevn> a hack per say
[06:55:05] <gvo> p3lim brb
[06:55:12] <dblosevn> ahimsa: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/538745/how-to-tell-if-a-script-tag-failed-to-load
[06:55:32] <p3lim> gvo: Now, there are multiple entries in there, which update based on what I click on, and change into something like the top one (which is expanded)
[06:55:45] <dblosevn> the setTimeout example
[06:57:48] <ahimsa> dblosevn: ok, I'll see about that. Thanks for the help!
[06:57:54] <dblosevn> np
[06:58:20] <dblosevn> if i had slept in the past 30 hours i probally would have caught that earlier :-(
[07:01:00] * Cork throws a bead on dblosevn 
[07:01:05] <lx4r> I have a website which creates iframes wrapped in a jQuery UI dialog. My problem: Every time I drag one of the dialogs around the iframes in all the others start reloading. My site: http://twitch.l3r.de/ (type "ignproleague" and "esltv_lol" into the input for testing).
[07:01:07] <Cork> *bed
[07:01:19] <lx4r> Would be awesome if anybody could help me ...
[07:01:29] <Cork> dblosevn: at that point its not really meaningful to try to code anymore
[07:01:40] <Cork> go and sleep, at least for an hour or two
[07:01:53] <djQuery> lx4r
[07:02:03] <djQuery> lx4r, have yo uchecked the bug db
[07:02:06] <the_dark_knight> Hi, anybody please help. Based on <tr>'s data-id how do I set text for n'th <td> - http://jsfiddle.net/hussaintamboli/U9b2u/ . ?
[07:02:06] <dblosevn> ya i gave up writing code a couple hours ago im just doing ui now
[07:02:17] <djQuery> lx4r, think I remember seeing something about iframes
[07:02:20] <Cork> -_-'
[07:02:27] <Nancy2012> Is it possible to disable all links on the especfic webpage by jquery???
[07:02:34] <NoWired> Cork, do you know any application to can convert a svg image to raphael, with differents areas? i found one, but converts all the svg to a raphael ....
[07:02:34] <lx4r> djQuery: Yes, I tried, I didn't find anything useful ...
[07:02:52] <dblosevn> im over 8 days behind scedule and im supossed to have a working admin panel by EOD today
[07:02:53] <lx4r> djQuery: Thanks for helping me in advance :-)
[07:03:01] <the_dark_knight> Cork: Hi, please help. Based on <tr>'s data-id how do I set text for n'th <td> - http://jsfiddle.net/hussaintamboli/U9b2u/ . ?
[07:03:04] <gvo> p3lim hm
[07:03:12] <Cork> NoWired: i think i saw one that worked with json or something
[07:03:29] <NoWired> Nancy2012, i think that something like " $('a').click(function(e) { e.preventDefault(); }); " or somethig similar
[07:03:30] <Cork> NoWired: but no i haven't really seen anything that works well enough for me
[07:03:43] <Cork> NoWired: i just recreated them (yes i know that sucks)
[07:03:43] <dblosevn> and my other dev is a lead for reality kings and hasnt been too availble
[07:04:21] <NoWired> Cork, because I see the documentation of raphaels, but I don't find anything to can get the coords of the diferents areas in the image ...
[07:04:22] <Nisse> How can i stop the showing of images?
[07:04:28] <NoiseEee> the_dark_knight: $("[data-id='myTr']").children('td')[2] would work
[07:04:38] <djQuery> lx4r, how do I recreate it on your site
[07:05:10] <dblosevn> cork: do you know of a nice jquery grid plugin that supports sorting the rows with drag and drop thats also editable?
[07:05:28] <lx4r> djQuery: Just type in something new. But you have to use existing channels. Tow that work are "ignproleague" and "esltv_lol"
[07:05:28] <Cork> the_dark_knight: or $("[data-item='myTr'] td").eq(2).html('here')
[07:05:34] <dblosevn> i know i found one in the past but i cant for the life of me find it again
[07:06:11] <Cork> dblosevn: heh. no, when i needed a grid all i found was so bad i had to write it my self
[07:06:11] <NoiseEee> the_dark_knight: your first selector should include the <tr> though; $('tr[data-id="myTR"]')
[07:07:01] <dblosevn> ya i ususally use ext for grids, the skys the limit with ext but i dont have the mindspace for it right now lol
[07:07:18] <Cork> dblosevn: if you find you don't hesitate to share ;)
[07:07:47] <Cork> dblosevn: actually ext sucks if you need to do anything they haven't thought of
[07:08:00] <Cork> dblosevn: but there designer is nice
[07:08:19] <gvo> p3lim: I think you'd need to drill down in the DOM by addressing child nodes all the way.  It's nasty but I don't know of any other way.
[07:08:29] <p3lim> Gah
[07:08:34] <gvo> I know
[07:08:39] <dblosevn> ya i love the designer, kind of boxes you in though, Ive never not been able to extend the core ui to do what i wanted tit too though
[07:09:08] <Cork> dblosevn: well ya, sure but its so damn over complicated
[07:09:14] <dblosevn> definitely
[07:09:16] <Cork> its WAY to much java over ext
[07:09:18] <p3lim> Can I do something like this?: $("#entry").(".entry-list") etc
[07:09:30] <p3lim> I'm used to working with tables in Lua
[07:09:42] <NoiseEee> p3lim: it would be  $("#entry .entry-list")
[07:09:45] <Cork> heck if you go back a little bit they even wrote js as java, and compiled it to javascript T_T
[07:09:49] <djQuery> lx4r, dont happen for me
[07:10:06] <djQuery> NoiseEee, esltv_lol
[07:10:18] <p3lim> NoiseEee: Thanks
[07:10:20] <gvo> p3lim:  but that would get you multiple elements, I think.
[07:10:31] <djQuery> the_dark_knight, http://jsfiddle.net/djquery/U9b2u/1/
[07:10:34] <p3lim> I don't mind that, is there a way to iterate over them?
[07:11:07] <NoiseEee> p3lim: everything returned by a jquery selector is essentially a collection, so yes.  look into .filter() and .each()
[07:11:11] <lx4r> djQuery: What does not happen? You type one of these names in and click the button and nothing happens?
[07:11:29] <djQuery> lx4r, I am using newest realesd chrome and it seems to work fine
[07:11:30] <p3lim> I think I've used .each() before
[07:11:47] <p3lim> But then the issue is, the DOM changes when I click on stuff
[07:11:55] <djQuery> lx4r, I drag around the dialogs and the one stays as I move the other
[07:11:56] <p3lim> Is there some event I can look for to update?
[07:12:29] <p3lim> Like with $(document).ready()
[07:14:17] <anli> Is there a way to make datatables put an attribute on each tr that has the value of an id?
[07:14:22] <gvo> $(document).click(function() { maybe?
[07:14:38] <lx4r> djQuery: Hmmm, that's weird, in Firefox on Linux and Windows it's causing problems. Can I do anything against this?
[07:14:52] <dblosevn> Cork: found something that looks promising, even looks like it supports jquery-ui theming
[07:15:05] <p3lim> I'll have to check
[07:15:05] <djQuery> anli, think the reason that it doesnt is that what happens when you have more than 1 table?
[07:15:25] <djQuery> anli, it cold possibly add more than 1 with same id
[07:15:28] <the_dark_knight> thanks djQuery , Cork NoiseEee . I got it.
[07:15:28] <Nisse> I don't understand why the .wrap does not work here? http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=9w40A8T0
[07:15:36] <anli> I dont want an attribute with the name id on each tr
[07:15:37] <gvo> p3lim: that should fire every click on  a page.
[07:15:47] <anli> More like data-id="23"
[07:16:24] <djQuery> anli, so you want to break it for every that may have 2 tables on the same page
[07:16:44] <anli> No?
[07:16:52] <anli> I can distinguish the tables, probably
[07:17:00] <Mottie> Nisse: Are you using jQuery 1.9+?
[07:18:01] <Nisse> Mottie: Yes
[07:18:06] <djQuery> anli, can I ask whats wrong with the selector $('[data-id="23"]', table)
[07:18:42] <djQuery> anli, when you put it in the scope of the table it shouldnt be that slow unless you have couple 1k rows in it
[07:19:03] <Mottie> Nisse: See http://jquery.com/upgrade-guide/1.9/#after-before-and-replacewith-with-disconnected-nodes
[07:19:21] <Mottie> Nisse: Oh hmm, not sure if that applies to wrap as well
[07:20:27] <Nisse> Mottie: It seems so. So how would i do it?
[07:20:50] <Nisse> Mottie: It makes no sense rendering all data and then change it after it has rendered.
[07:22:37] <Mottie> Nisse: Try appending it after the #ajax-holder, then just remove the holder
[07:23:26] <Nisse> Mottie: I did that, will have to do. Thanks for pointing out the change, i would have gone MAD !
[07:23:34] <Mottie> Nisse: Actually
[07:23:50] <Mottie> Nisse: I think the replaceWith change only applies to using it ON disconnected nodes
[07:23:53] <dblosevn> Cork: http://paramquery.com/ does everything I need with a pretty simple api except doesnt support drag and drag ordering
[07:24:02] <Mottie> Nisse: #ajax-holder isn't disconnected
[07:24:16] <dblosevn> Cork: and it does use jquery=ui themeing
[07:25:12] <Nisse> Mottie: Still can't get wrap to work like before, i can only add nodes once i have placed the response inside the DOM.
[07:25:16] <Mottie> Nisse: Ahhh I know what the problem is
[07:25:38] <Nisse> Mottie: Do tell :)
[07:25:56] <Mottie> Nisse: You are appending $gallery, which is wrapped in a div, but you're not appending that wrapper... try $('#ajax-holder').replaceWith($gallery.parent());
[07:27:09] <Nisse> Mottie: D'oh..
[07:27:14] <Nisse> Mottie: Thanks
[07:27:19] <Mottie> LOL it's happened to me before too :P
[07:27:53] <Nisse> Mottie: Sometimes you just goof up :)
[07:27:58] <Nisse> Mottie: Thanks for the help
[07:28:07] <GeO> hey guys
[07:28:27] <GeO> I'd like to interrupt an effect in the middle : explode
[07:28:45] <GeO> how can I do that? I tried to stop() with a setTimeout but it didn't work
[07:28:55] <Kambfhase> inerrupting an explosion is physically impossibru
[07:29:01] <Mottie> Nisse: anytime :P
[07:29:45] <GeO> Kambfhase : jQuery can do impossible things
[07:29:48] <Cork> dblosevn: nice
[07:30:21] <Kambfhase> My little Script: jQuery is Magic
[07:30:31] <Anitox> I'm using $.get() to request a page, but I only want one element from it.  How can I select that element out the returned data?
[07:30:37] <GeO> jokes aside, do you see a way?
[07:30:50] <djQuery> Kambfhase, have you seen greensocks?
[07:31:17] <djQuery> Kambfhase, http://www.greensock.com/
[07:32:06] <Kambfhase> I only know www.blacksocks.com
[07:33:31] <anli> djQuery: There is nothing wrong with that, the problem is that I cannot make datatables emit those data-id attributes for each tr
[07:33:41] <anli> I never worry about performance
[07:38:21] <p3lim> Getting nowhere with this: http://jsfiddle.net/fzEpE/2/
[07:39:32] <sCoRpi> p3lim: what's that supposed to do?
[07:40:05] <p3lim> Print the href of the link in the console
[07:40:09] <p3lim> Just for testing
[07:40:25] <p3lim> .text() works, .href doesn't
[07:40:42] <sCoRpi> because tehre is no .href?
[07:40:42] <Mottie> p3lim: that should be $("#current-entry .item-body a").attr('href') or $("#current-entry .item-body a")[0].href
[07:40:48] <sCoRpi> attr('href') it is
[07:40:52] <p3lim> Ah
[07:40:54] <p3lim> Thanks
[07:41:01] <sCoRpi> btw
[07:41:11] <sCoRpi> jsfiddle slow for you guys too?
[07:41:21] <Mottie> yep
[07:42:29] <Mottie> jsfiddle was really really slow until I completely cleared my cache in Chrome... now it's only moderately slow
[07:44:03] <p3lim> Yay it works
[07:44:30] <maxmoore14> hey - random question... I can't seem to find a link to subscribe to the jqm blog by e-mail. Anyone know where it is?
[07:45:02] <djQuery> sCoRpi, Mottie, I switched to jsbin.com a long time ago because of speed issues
[07:45:25] <lx4r> djQuery: I can reproduce the bug with Chromium :-(.
[07:46:37] <ShawnRisk> How do I make the first td toggle the second td and start closed?  Here is the code: <td><a href="#" class="usertimecard"></td> <td class="timecardslide"></td> jQuery(document).ready(function($){ $(".usertimecard").click(function(e){ e.preventDefault(); $(".timecardslide").slideToggle(); }); });
[07:46:45] <djQuery> sCoRpi, Mottie, jsbin also has autocomplete tied to the tab key
[07:47:07] <p3lim> Finished, thanks for the help
[07:47:09] <p3lim> https://github.com/p3lim/dotjs/commit/5b30d8243f0bad8d7c0dad1bf32ba30e59dd9aea
[07:47:09] <b-ot> p3lim: Adrian L Lange (20s): Stupid magnet links misbehaving
[07:47:28] <Cork> ShawnRisk: $(this).next().slideToggle(); ?
[07:47:59] <djQuery> ShawnRisk, you only want to td on the same row?
[07:48:00] <Cork> ShawnRisk: and start closed is do the $(selection).hide()
[07:48:02] <lx4r> djQuery: What should I do now?
[07:48:14] <Mottie> djQuery: I don't know, I don't like how it updates without me wanting it to
[07:49:06] <djQuery> $(this).closest('td').nextSibling().slideToggle();
[07:49:20] <djQuery> ShawnRisk, ^^^^^^66
[07:49:41] <djQuery> Mottie, there is a check that u can undo in the upper right of the output
[07:49:48] <Cork> ah, the click was on an link
[07:49:54] <ahimsa> dblosevn: btw. I just now figured out that my approach of using jsonp was probably wrong from the beginning, since I could just use CORS as I'm targetting html5 enabled browsers (and I don't care about IE) :)
[07:50:00] <Mottie> djQuery: that's just auto-run js
[07:51:17] <djQuery> dang chrome is getting close to passing html5test.com
[07:51:55] <ShawnRisk> djQuery: I will look at that
[07:52:05] <ShawnRisk> djQuery: can you ask the question again?
[07:52:30] <kerozene> html5test gets a lot of hate on whatwg
[07:53:34] <djQuery> kerozene, is there a better test?
[07:54:08] <kerozene> djQuery: no, because a lot of the specs being 'tested' aren't settled at all
[07:56:10] <djQuery> lol ie10 only scores 320
[07:56:30] <djQuery> kerozene, well they only been working on it how long?
[07:56:47] <kerozene> djQuery: define 'it'
[07:56:55] <kerozene> it won't ever stop
[07:57:06] <kerozene> anyway, o/t
[07:57:46] <djQuery> yeah
[08:00:48] <NoWired> is there any function of jquery for knows the version that it's running?
[08:00:59] <anew_> yes
[08:01:03] <anew_> cant remember the command tho lol
[08:01:07] <johnkpaul> NoWired: $().jquery
[08:01:10] <johnkpaul> ?eval $().jquery
[08:01:10] <anew_> yeah
[08:01:14] <anew_> was just about to look it up
[08:01:18] <djQuery> NoWired, $.fn.jquery
[08:01:22] <dblosevn> ?g jQuery.version
[08:01:22] <b-ot> dblosevn: Download jQuery | jQuery → http://jquery.com/download/
[08:01:36] <dblosevn> well that was gay
[08:01:41] <NoWired> thx
[08:02:00] <djQuery> NoWired, by the way for jquery ui its   $.ui.version
[08:02:14] <Mottie> $.fn.version
[08:03:25] <djQuery> Mottie, just tested it and $fn.version is undefined. $.fn.jquery works
[08:03:37] <Mottie> oops that's what I meant LOL
[08:04:26] <Mottie> you can do $('.selector').version as well
[08:04:41] <Mottie> ACK $('.selector').jquery
[08:04:45] <Mottie> LOL
[08:05:23] <GeO> I'm looking for a plugin which slices an image in some horizontal parts, I can't find one tho I'm sure it exists :/
[08:06:03] <Mottie> Nivo slider does that
[08:06:29] <lx4r> djQuery: are you still here? I rebuilt my site but now I have another problem ...
[08:06:57] <djQuery> ?ask@lx4r
[08:07:13] <pachet> i feel like i've built image slicers in fiddle like
[08:07:16] <pachet> at least 5 times
[08:07:17] <rmill> djQuery, you can use ?api when bot-t isn't around.
[08:07:23] <rmill> ?api .version
[08:07:23] <lx4r> Lol
[08:07:23] <b-ot> rmill: No matches.
[08:07:28] <djQuery> dang laxy bot
[08:07:30] <rmill> ?api jQuery.version
[08:07:30] <b-ot> rmill: No matches.
[08:07:32] <rmill> :|
[08:07:36] <rmill> NVM!
[08:07:57] <rmill> ?ask
[08:07:58] <b-ot> rmill: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[08:08:10] <lx4r> Ah, okay
[08:08:26] <lx4r> djQuery: Sorry, didn't mean to be inpolite
[08:12:12] <lx4r> I have a site which creates draggable iframes. My problem: I created a button to close an iframe but for some reason the button doesn't fire the event. Site: http://twitch.l3r.de/test.html (use "ignproleague" and "esltv_lol" for testing as chat names).
[08:12:22] <lx4r> Would be awesome if anybody could help me O:-)
[08:14:17] <scar> i can't get .select() to work on a textarea... is this the wrong method?
[08:14:32] <scar> nvm
[08:14:41] <scar> its being generated, need to retrigger
[08:14:53] <lx4r> What does "nvm" mean? ^^
[08:15:31] <tw2113> "nevermind"
[08:16:21] <Mottie> lx4r: Try $('.test').click(function(){ $(this).closest('div').remove(); });
[08:17:56] <lx4r> Mottie: Okay, will try, give me a moment ...
[08:18:38] <GreatPotato> If i have the following: http://pastebin.com/pzPnRKMZ
[08:18:53] <GreatPotato> How can i assign the click event to the <a>'s of that ul?
[08:20:07] <Kambfhase> GreatPotato: http://api.jquery.com/on/
[08:20:22] <tw2113> Kambfhase, he creates the ul and whatnot via js
[08:20:24] <lx4r> Mottie: Noooooo, it doesn't work :-(. Can you see all the source code or should I upload it somewhere?
[08:20:26] <Mottie> GreatPotato: hopefully, you are appending the $ul to the page... then just use $ul.find('a').on('click', function(){ /* do someting */ });
[08:20:46] <Kambfhase> tw2113: so, what?
[08:20:47] <GreatPotato> Normally would be on('click', 'a', function() { … }) but that doesn't work in this instance
[08:21:09] <tw2113> just making sure you're aware
[08:21:12] <Mottie> GreatPotato: what version of jQuery are you using?
[08:21:12] <stocka> is there an issue with icon generation in the jQuery UI themeroller?  certain icon sets (like http://download.jqueryui.com/themeroller/images/ui-icons_336699_256x240.png) don't result in the colors that I expect
[08:21:13] <GreatPotato> Yeh but i want it to work like the old 'live'
[08:21:15] <GreatPotato> 1.7
[08:21:19] <tw2113> if you can still use .on with that, then i learn new stuff
[08:21:32] <Mottie> GreatPotato: use delegate instead
[08:21:32] <BillCriswell> GreatPotato: That second parameter is only for attributes.
[08:22:09] <Kambfhase> http://pastebin.com/EjpC97aL
[08:22:20] <Mottie> GreatPotato: oops I guess on() was added in 1.7... use .on('click', 'a', function().....
[08:22:52] <GreatPotato> Can't I use the syntax i posted? It just keeps my file more organised, if not i suppose that will have to do
[08:23:09] <tw2113> go with the future-proof one
[08:23:21] <tw2113> if you ugrade your jQuery version later, it'll break this
[08:23:32] <tw2113> if you go with live()/delegate()
[08:23:48] <Mottie> lx4r: Are you using the [x] for the chat or the [x] for the page?
[08:24:27] <Kambfhase> nope, using $("<div>", object) you cant pass a selector argument
[08:24:32] <GreatPotato> Yeh i definitely won't use live, no need.
[08:24:40] <GreatPotato> Ah cool thanks Kambfhase
[08:25:04] <GreatPotato> jQuery docs are the least clear docs I've ever seen, can never find the answer i need
[08:25:14] <GreatPotato> Always end up trawling through the source
[08:26:03] <lx4r> Mottie: I'm referring to the [x] under the chat (which is supposed to be on top of it :-(), the one on top of the page is just to show the the button itself works ^^
[08:27:34] <Kambfhase> GreatPotato: haha, just looked into the source to verify my wild guess. No, there is really no way to that, without the extra call to .on()
[08:28:00] <Mottie> lx4r: OH! LOL the button is added dynamically, you'll need to use on() to delegate the event... $('#wrapper').on('click', '.test', function(){ $(this).closest('div').remove(); });
[08:28:04] <Kambfhase> unless you write the code yourself
[08:28:10] <maxmoore14> anyone know how to subscribe to the jqm blog by email? can't find a link for it...
[08:28:52] <CodeFriar> Any pointers on how to load bootstrap-transitions.js with jquery.noConflict ? the docs on the site don't quite make sense to me. I'm getting the error just including the script ...
[08:29:17] <Kambfhase> Here, have this pointer: NULL
[08:29:31] <CodeFriar> Kambfhase: awe thanks!
[08:29:35] <CodeFriar> how's that help?
[08:31:58] <johnkpaul> CodeFriar: you shouldn't have to do any extra work with jQUeyr no conflict
[08:32:13] <BillCriswell> CodeFriar: You shouldn't have to touch anything.
[08:32:18] <johnkpaul> bootstrap passes $ as window.jQuery
[08:32:20] <BillCriswell> Bah, didn't scroll down.
[08:32:25] <johnkpaul> :)
[08:32:32] <CodeFriar> johnkpaul: there are other jquery plguins on the page that I can't control
[08:32:55] <johnkpaul> CodeFriar: oh, so your problem isn't with bootstrap?
[08:33:24] <johnkpaul> you're going to have to wrap those in (function($){}(window.jQuery))
[08:33:25] <CodeFriar> well i think it's with loading the boostrap module in jqueryNoconflict mode
[08:33:30] <lx4r> Mottie: Whoooooooo, it works, thanks a lot. One last question: How can I get the close button above the iframe ^^?
[08:34:19] <Mottie> lx4r: css
[08:35:11] <BillCriswell> CodeFriar: Just keep in mind you would need to use jQuery and not $ after jQuery.noConflict().
[08:35:14] <CodeFriar> johnkpaul: do you have an example ?
[08:35:15] <lx4r> Mottie: Yeah, of course but can I just include it in the p element which is used as a handle?
[08:35:36] <johnkpaul> CodeFriar: I'm not realy confident I am understanding your problem
[08:35:40] <CodeFriar> BillCriswell: i called var $j = jquery.noConflict() so I could use $j
[08:36:12] <BillCriswell> CodeFriar: jQuery.noConflict()
[08:36:41] <BillCriswell> jquery is probably not defined, jQuery should be.
[08:37:05] <lil-murph> What happens if I reject a deferred that's already resolved? is it ignored?
[08:37:06] <CodeFriar> johnkpaul: when I try to include bootstrap-transition.js it throws an error about can't read property webkit of undefined -- on a line that says $.browser.webkit
[08:37:21] <johnkpaul> ah CodeFriar that's a different problem
[08:37:23] <CodeFriar> BillCriswell: so I need to refactor all my $j to just jQuery ?
[08:37:26] <johnkpaul> you need to upgrade bootstrap
[08:37:32] <johnkpaul> you're using a new version of jQuery without $.browser
[08:37:40] <johnkpaul> you can either upgrade bootstrap or use the jquery 1.9 migration plugin
[08:37:50] <bobinator60> #join couchdb
[08:38:04] <Mottie> lx4r: .btn-mini {position: absolute;top: 0;right: 0;} .. then you'll need to make the draggable bar not 100% width
[08:38:53] <CodeFriar> johnkpaul: trying upgrade of transition file
[08:40:10] <lx4r> Mottie: Weird, doesn't work :-(
[08:40:43] <Mottie> add that to your button.btn.btn-mini,input[type="submit"].btn.btn-mini {} definition
[08:41:38] <Mottie> lx4r: that's a bit excessive with the css selectors though
[08:42:20] <lx4r> Mottie: Whaaaaat? ^^ I don't understand what you mean ^^
[08:43:30] <Mottie> lx4r: LOL nm, that's in the bootstrap.min.css file
[08:44:11] <Mottie> lx4r: either way, it looks like it's working
[08:45:20] <lx4r> Mottie: With me the button is not in the top right. With you?
[08:45:41] <Mottie> lx4r: it's next to the chat window name
[08:45:55] <Mottie> lx4r: but like I said that's just a css issue.
[08:46:26] <lx4r> Mottie: Any way I can fix that CSS issue and just have it in the top bottom corner?
[08:47:20] <Mottie> lx4r: http://www.barelyfitz.com/screencast/html-training/css/positioning/
[08:49:18] <lx4r> Mottie: Thanks :-)
[08:50:26] <anli> Is there anyone that have got sWidth to work in datatables?
[08:54:06] <jnettik> Trying to position a div created by jquery using mousemove(). I'm creating vars for the coordinates and in the mousemove() callback setting values of the variables. however the updated values are never available outside mousemove(). what am I doing wrong?
[08:55:48] <bil`> jnettik: got a link to a jsFiddle or something?
[08:57:53] <fission6> how do i select and check a radio input with a specific value? the value will be determined by a query string param
[08:59:39] <jnettik> bil`: http://pastebin.com/nc7M8nXp
[09:01:52] <fission6> is this right / best $("input[name='whatever'][value='value']").prop('checked', true)
[09:05:10] <computer2000> sorry bit offtopic: for broad support is it sufficient to offer html5 videos in mp4 and ogv or is webm also needed?
[09:07:03] <discorpia> computer2000: i think you will cover all browsers if you do mp4+ogv
[09:07:13] <computer2000> discorpia: thx
[09:08:00] <discorpia> computer2000: ie9+, chrome and safari does mp4, and firefox maybe also, but firefox definitely does ogv as does opera. so ie9+, chrome, safari, firefox and opera covered =)
[09:08:29] <computer2000> discorpia: cool
[09:12:53] <DukeDrake> hi
[09:15:00] <maltray> Hey
[09:18:22] <tomasm-> hi, is there a way to $.extend() an object, but only deeper pieces inside the object? this is a nested object, and I want to change obj.axes.xaxis.renderer, for example, among other pieces (it'd be easiest to pass two objects and it just do a recursive copy of the second onto the first)
[09:18:48] <iaj> Hi there... how could I check if a checkbox with #check_uid2450_0 is checked or not?
[09:19:11] <Kambfhase> $('#check_foo').is(':checked')
[09:19:59] <Mottie> tomasm-: use $.extend(true, ... )
[09:20:07] <iaj> thnx Kambfhase
[09:20:58] <Nancy2012> $(this).value() uses for fetching the value..
[09:21:17] <Nancy2012> it is possible to fetch key $(this).key()
[09:21:39] <Nancy2012> i have selected the dropdown value and passing it on jquery función..
[09:21:54] <Nancy2012> and i want to get the key that i select..
[09:22:08] <tomasm-> Mottie, thanks
[09:22:37] <Kambfhase> 'key'?
[09:23:04] <Mottie> Nancy2012: maybe you want the option text? $('option:selected').text()
[09:23:27] <Mottie> tomasm-: You're welcome! :)
[09:24:29] <Consolas> anyone here uses leaflet ?
[09:24:43] <Nancy2012> Mottie: yes.. but it returns me all options
[09:25:34] <Nancy2012> i have multi dropdown hole the same valyes
[09:26:20] <limpc> how do you set values outside of an $.ajax() call?
[09:26:59] <Mottie> Nancy2012: Try this: http://jsfiddle.net/Mottie/49Q2B/
[09:27:09] <limpc> i have var projectID = 0; outside the call, and in the call's success: function(dta) { } I set projectID = dta.projectid;  but projectID is still 0
[09:28:26] <Mottie> limpc: you're probably checking the value of projectID before the success function is called
[09:29:00] <Mottie> limpc: add a console.log( projectID) after you set it in the success function
[09:29:00] <Nancy2012> Mottie: thanks
[09:29:02] <Nancy2012> wnks
[09:29:06] <Nancy2012> it works :)
[09:29:10] <Mottie> Nancy2012: You're welcome! :)
[09:29:16] <Nancy2012> can i ask u something more..
[09:29:23] <Nancy2012> i am working on fancybox
[09:29:30] <Mottie> Nancy2012: ask away
[09:29:53] <limpc> console.log() inside success:() {} ?
[09:29:54] <limpc> or outside
[09:30:06] <Mottie> limpc: inside to make sure it's being set
[09:30:28] <Nancy2012> i mean.. i am using fancybox and loading the whole  webpage on an iframe.. but this iframe is just for seeing the preview.. therefore, i want to disabled all weblinks
[09:30:48] <Nancy2012> so user can not access the whole weblinks.. just to see as an image...
[09:30:59] <Nancy2012> Is there any way to do this so?
[09:31:18] <Mottie> Nancy2012: If the iframe is loading a page from another site, then no...
[09:31:38] <limpc> Mottie: console.log shows the correct value
[09:31:41] <raj> any jquery plugin that turns ul/li into select looking thing?
[09:31:47] <Mottie> Nancy2012: but you could apply a transparent overlay over the iframe. which doesn't cover the scroll bar
[09:31:56] <Nancy2012> note.. i am loading the same website..
[09:32:50] <Mottie> Nancy2012: Then you can access the iframe like this... inside the fancybox loaded callback: $('iframe').contents().find('a').prop('disabled', true);
[09:33:01] <Nancy2012> but i have 2 panel.. forntend and backend.. so backend user can see the preview (which normally loads on iframe) and if everything looks perfect..then user can make it published..
[09:33:41] <djQuery> Nancy2012, then in the page that the iframe loads put a param as to what type of user they are
[09:33:54] <djQuery> Nancy2012, that would be server side code to
[09:34:26] <Mottie> limpc: how are you checking that value outside then?... the function that checks it should be called from the success function
[09:34:29] <djQuery> Nancy2012, then in that same page check to see if it is set to true and do the java script to block the links there
[09:35:29] <Nancy2012> so i need to do(server side coding) on the page which has to be loaded on iframe..
[09:36:07] <djQuery> Nancy2012, well how are yo ustoring whether it is front end of backend?
[09:36:12] <limpc> its all inside one function. when a form is submitted it calls a function which checks the name to ensure there's no collisions and if none, a project id is returned. the call then redirects the user to another page where they can edit project details
[09:38:09] <Nancy2012> storing what???
[09:38:12] <Mottie> limpc then why do you need the variable outside of the success function?
[09:38:15] <Nancy2012> i am not storing anything..
[09:38:20] <Nancy2012> it is just a simple call..
[09:38:49] <Mottie> Nancy2012: I think the snippet I shared should work for you
[09:38:56] <Nancy2012> by specific URL that you can access fornt end page whether their status are hidden or active
[09:38:58] <limpc> Mottie: function() { var myvar;  $.ajax({ success: function() { myvar = projectid; } }); }
[09:39:42] <Nancy2012> this.. . $('iframe').contents().find('a').prop('disabled', true); ???
[09:39:55] <Mottie> limpc: yes, but where are you checking myvar to see if it changed
[09:39:59] <Mottie> Nancy2012: yes
[09:40:08] <limpc> after the $.ajax({});
[09:40:11] <Nancy2012> ok.. let me try
[09:40:13] <Nancy2012> thanks dude
[09:40:19] <limpc> im assuming async is messing with it?
[09:40:40] <djQuery> Nancy2012, then just always search for the <a> that are disabled and attach a click event that returns false on them
[09:40:40] <Mottie> limpc: which is why I said you need to check it from a call inside the success function... yes it's async
[09:40:49] <litenull> Nancy2012: you could just add an event handler on the iframe with: $(document.getElementById('iframe_id').contentWindow.document).click()
[09:40:50] <limpc> k thankss
[09:40:58] <litenull> and preventdefault
[09:41:15] <Mottie> disabled should work too o.O
[09:41:34] <litenull> yea
[09:43:57] <DukeDrake> how can I use find() to select all '> ul' ?
[09:44:09] <Nancy2012> please see my JS code..
[09:44:11] <Nancy2012> http://jsfiddle.net/xg6Rq/
[09:44:44] <Nancy2012> i just need to know where should i put this code… $('iframe').contents().find('a').prop('disabled', true);
[09:44:53] <litenull> nice code :)
[09:45:14] <Nancy2012> i dont think so ;)
[09:45:32] <Kambfhase> DukeDrake: why not try .childrren("ul") ?
[09:45:33] <litenull> sarkazm intended :P
[09:45:39] <Nancy2012> I am also trying to learn it
[09:45:51] <DukeDrake> Kambfhase: thanx!! =D
[09:46:18] <Mottie> Nancy2012: is beforeShow still a callback in fancybox?...
[09:46:38] <Nancy2012> yes.. but i am not sure.. let me check it please
[09:46:39] <Mottie> Nancy2012: http://fancybox.net/api  .. or are you using an older version?
[09:46:52] <Nancy2012> i am using the latest version
[09:46:55] <Mottie> either way that's where that code should be added
[09:47:07] <litenull> true
[09:47:08] <Mottie> Nancy2012: then use onComplete
[09:48:47] <Mottie> Nancy2012: hmm, but you might need to add a callback for when the iframe has completely loaded
[09:50:27] <litenull> Nancy2012: in the iframe do window.onload = function() { parent.iframeloaded() }
[09:50:28] <Nancy2012> I cant see any onComplete función
[09:50:48] <litenull> and in the dom do function iframeloaded() { callback stuff }
[09:50:59] <litenull> the disable bit
[09:51:54] <Nancy2012> I can see there is función named : afterLoad on fancybox
[09:52:20] <Nancy2012> and i think it uses for these kind of purposes
[09:52:37] <Mottie> Nancy2012: Try this http://jsfiddle.net/Mottie/xg6Rq/2/
[09:52:53] <Mottie> Nancy2012: I linked to the api: http://fancybox.net/api
[09:53:14] <Nancy2012> thanks  :)
[09:53:17] <Nancy2012> let me try
[09:53:39] <Mottie> litenull: the iframe is loaded inside of fancybox
[09:54:47] <litenull> yeah sorry :/
[09:54:52] <Nancy2012> Nope… it wouldnt work ..
[09:55:00] <Nancy2012> i can see all links are active
[09:55:03] <Nancy2012> :(
[09:56:40] <litenull> thats weird, the code is ok
[09:56:49] <Nancy2012> just becoz onComplete is not fancybox´s función
[09:57:08] <litenull> it is in the api
[09:57:47] <Mottie> Nancy2012: maybe you're using the older version?
[09:58:21] <Mottie> Nancy2012: the lastest version before they switched it to fancybox2
[09:59:04] <Nancy2012> i m using … version: 2.1.4 (Thu, 10 Jan 2013)
[09:59:10] <Nancy2012> today i updated the versión
[09:59:22] <Nancy2012> because it was not working on last version
[10:00:35] <litenull> does your iframe have some id ?
[10:00:56] <ryannielson> Hey I'm using hammer.js to slide a menu out from the left on a slide gesture. The thing sliding out has overflow: auto on it to allow scrolling. But because I have hammer on "body", it seems to be disallowing the scrolling. Anyone ever have this problem?
[10:02:26] <Mottie> Nancy2012: Odd, these docs http://fancyapps.com/fancybox/#docs show a beforeShow callback
[10:02:32] <Nancy2012> yes.. i m passing the path( in which, i have ID
[10:02:54] <Duzzy> Hi, how come that when I try to run an plugin that I am loading succesfully (i can click the link in the source and it brings up the code) that im getting "TypeError: $.Zebra_TransForm is not a function". I get it with all plugins im trying to load, so obviously im doing something wring, anyone got a clue?
[10:03:33] <Nancy2012> Mottie: should i replace  onComplete to beforeShow
[10:03:40] <Mottie> Nancy2012: and this blog post by the author shows onComplete http://www.tomauger.com/2011/web-development/fancybox-api-using-callbacks LOL
[10:03:48] <Mottie> Nancy2012: sure try it
[10:03:54] <Nancy2012> ok..
[10:03:58] <Nancy2012> let me try
[10:04:05] <Mottie> Nancy2012: I guess I could dig in the code...
[10:05:43] <garbagecollectio> so what exactly does no conflict do?
[10:05:57] <Nancy2012> Nope.. i tried.. seems it wouldnt work..
[10:06:06] <Nancy2012> :(
[10:06:11] <Mottie> Nancy2012: yep use beforeShow: https://github.com/fancyapps/fancyBox/blob/master/source/jquery.fancybox.js#L184
[10:09:07] <stocka> themeroller icons should always be of the color I request, right? or is there extra processing/transformation that happens in some cases? because I'm not getting back the color of icons I expect in the themeroller
[10:09:32] <litenull> lol @ crappy documentation
[10:10:05] <Mottie> Nancy2012: try adding these console logs...  http://jsfiddle.net/Mottie/xg6Rq/4/
[10:12:39] <Nancy2012> thanks…
[10:12:40] <Nancy2012> i
[10:12:55] <Nancy2012> i m trying .. i dont know why it takes long time to load up this iframe
[10:16:36] <Mottie> litenull: LOL I guess I can't read... that blog post was written before FancyBox2 ... *sigh* I need more caffeine
[10:17:53] <litenull> you triggered my caffeine need :)
[10:17:56] <litenull> grr
[10:18:05] <Mottie> LOL
[10:18:34] <fission6> is there a handy way to serialize a form into json
[10:19:26] <snover> dojo/dom-form domForm.toObject(form)
[10:19:28] <Mottie> fission6: http://api.jquery.com/serialize/
[10:19:31] <snover> oh, oops, wrong channel
[10:19:36] <slick-> is there a quick way to check if any text box is empty inside a certain div
[10:19:40] <slick-> i know how to do it for a single textbox
[10:19:48] <fission6> Mottie yes i am aware of that but that produces a query string like serialization
[10:19:50] <Mottie> fission6: Opps, that's into a string
[10:19:57] <fission6> i want more of a json object
[10:19:59] <snover> well you can still use dojo/dom-form ;)
[10:20:08] <Mottie> lol
[10:20:27] <Mottie> fission6: Maybe you can use .map()
[10:20:33] <maxmoore14> is it possible to target multiple pages with a pagecreate event in jqm?
[10:21:17] <maxmoore14> something like this:
[10:21:19] <maxmoore14> $(document).on('pagecreate', $('#page1, #page2'), function (event) {});
[10:21:19] <fission6> oh even simpler, a way to just create an object of fields and values from a form
[10:22:26] <maxmoore14> The problem I'm having is that it seems to be triggering for every page regardless of id
[10:25:01] <tomasm-> hey I just tried playing around with jquery mobile and merely inserting the include file caused the whole page to mess up. specifically, it added duplicate submit buttons and submitting a form did nothing. any ideas why?
[10:28:02] <litenull> maxmoore14: instead of $('#page1, #page2') do '#page1, #page2'
[10:28:31] <maxmoore14> ok, just as a string?
[10:28:35] <litenull> yes
[10:28:40] <tomasm-> yeah on() takes a selector as a string, not the objects themselves
[10:29:14] <tgodar> hi, having trouble overriding this `jQuery("a.butReopen").click(function() `, I am trying to supersede this handler with another one selecting on the specific id, have tried return false and all sorts of stopFoo with the event object.  What am I doing wrong?
[10:29:41] <tomasm-> tgodar e.stopImmediatePropagation() ?
[10:30:07] <maxmoore14> litenull: thx
[10:30:35] <tgodar> tomasm-: nice, guess I tried *most* event stopFoo options... that did the trick
[10:31:14] <tomasm-> stopPropagation() only prevents ancestors from handling. stopImmediatePropagation() is for other handlers on the same object
[10:31:49] <maxmoore14> one more question - know how to detect the length of the history?
[10:32:05] <maxmoore14> not the browser history, just the current application history
[10:32:10] <tgodar> guess I am having trouble picturing the 'ancestor scenario' at all - I'll have to read up some - thanks again
[10:32:38] <maxmoore14> so, on the first page load, the length should be 0
[10:32:41] <tomasm-> tgodar, any object that wraps around the element in question, ie <div>, <body>, etc
[10:32:59] <tgodar> ahh, more the 'bubble up' - i get it
[10:33:04] <fission6> there isn't a jquery method to convert an object to json?
[10:33:28] <tomasm-> fission6, arent objects json compatible anyway?
[10:33:37] <litenull> np :)
[10:33:46] <maxmoore14> fission6: JSON.stringify()
[10:34:06] <fission6> was hoping for something in jqueyr
[10:35:22] <krislappy> fission6: form2js?
[10:35:33] <Mottie> fission6: JSON is a javascript object: JavaScript Object Notation
[10:35:39] <litenull> fission6: JSON.stringify is just fine
[10:35:56] <fission6> ^ not supported on all browsers
[10:36:09] <litenull> what are you doing it for ? ie 6 ? :)
[10:37:23] <maxmoore14> litenull: know how to detect length of app history? want to dynamically create a back button if length > 0 else home button
[10:38:16] <fission6> this looks cool for making an object from a form https://github.com/hongymagic/jQuery.serializeObject
[10:40:30] <Mottie> fission6: it's pretty small too (https://github.com/hongymagic/jQuery.serializeObject/blob/master/jquery.serializeObject.js)... like I said before you can probably do the same thing with map()
[10:40:39] <fission6> word
[10:40:47] <p3lim> Working on a plugin for chrome, one question, is there any way to get the path to the AppData directory without using %APPDATA%?
[10:40:59] <p3lim> Because in some cases that env ain't set
[10:41:08] <litenull> maxmoore14: $.mobile.urlHistory
[10:41:20] <thaifood> Is there a jquery accordion or tree menu that I can slide in and out from the side and pin to stick it ?
[10:41:35] <thaifood> or maybe i need just some slider and put my tree in it
[10:42:28] <thaifood> maybe it's called a sliding / pinnable panel?
[10:42:54] <maxmoore14> litenull: how does urlHistory.activeIndex get updated? or would you use .stack.length?
[10:44:04] <litenull> maxmoore14: im not sure, id have to go in the code, but i dont have much time. both things seem to be updated
[10:44:12] <litenull> :)
[10:44:28] <maxmoore14> litenull: cool, thx for the help
[10:44:32] <litenull> np
[10:49:39] <jackjackw> guys trying to get jscrollpane working with a twitter feed which has overflow-y set to scroll. once i try and initialise jscrollpane on the target div, the scroll appears, then disappears. any1 had this issue or know whats going on?
[10:54:18] <thaifood> Anyone know how to make a horizontal sliding panel ?
[10:54:20] <maxmoore14> litenull: still having trouble actually. urlHistory seems to have 1 item at all times - I'm using single page templates if that matters...
[10:55:00] <litenull> maxmoore14: in the jquery mobile documentation works fine.. could you make a fiddle or smth ?
[10:55:18] <maxmoore14> yeah, I'll try, one sec
[10:55:19] <jackjackw> thaifood - open and closed classes - widths for the classes defined in the css, toggle the classes on button click
[10:55:47] <thaifood> cool, thanks jackjackw   that seems doable
[10:56:15] <thaifood> i'm guessing the animate of closing adds more complexity
[10:56:38] <ahimsa> Hello. I want to allow only alphanumeric characters on a text input field in a form. I tried googling and this http://www.devcurry.com/2009/10/allow-only-alphanumeric-characters-in.html sounds like a reasonable approach. Are there any better/easier solutions that don't depend on extra plugins?
[10:56:42] <jackjackw> yeah animating does make it a bit trickier
[10:56:49] <thaifood> this might do it for me http://codebomber.com/jquery/slidepanel/
[10:57:16] <litenull> thaifood: nice nickname lol :D
[10:57:16] <Uthark> Guys, I'm trying to replace some old HTML table layout (3 rows, 1 column) that refreshes every second with something new. I'm stuck with the layout: shall I keep the HTML table and use jquery or jqueryui to make it pretty and self-updating thru websockets or ajax?
[10:57:20] <thaifood> hehe, thx
[10:58:41] <litenull> thaifood: are you a drivein thai food programming freelancer ? :P

[11:14:36] <litenull> ok
[11:17:08] <Nisse> Hey
[11:17:43] <Nisse> I'm having a hard time filtering out an ajax response - the images in the response always loads, even while i replace the src attribute in a datafilter.
[11:18:47] <tomasm-> if I want to capture events from one object and pass them along to another, would mousemove/mouseup/mousedown be sufficient for draggable use? or do I need to add other events too?
[11:21:01] <fission6> is there anything in jquery to help merge to objects / hash maps?
[11:22:04] <laidback_01> hey, ah, I'm overthinking this I from what I can tell.  So, I have a post form submit based on javascript.  Now, the return is in JSON, and if data.status == "ERROR" then it'll update a messages div with the given data.error string.  Cool, that works fine.  So, now I want to reload the entire page with the orginal query if data.status == "SUCCESS", but I'm not sure how to do that.  I keep finding several ways to update parts of the page, I just want to r
[11:22:05] <laidback_01> e-run the query so they can see the most recent list.  what's the command for  "URI POST with these parameters, load up the page right here"
[11:22:11] <litenull> fission6: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.extend/
[11:22:26] <tomasm-> anyone know what the events triggered are in draggable?
[11:22:55] <fission6> thanks litenull, good call
[11:22:59] <tomasm-> laidback_01, to load the WHOLE page, set window.location.href
[11:23:37] <laidback_01> tomasm-, oh, okay, thanks, I'll look that up.  hoping it works with a post query ;)
[11:23:52] <maxmoore14> litenull: SO CONFUSED. definitely working like you said in fiddle
[11:24:10] <maxmoore14> getting really wonky results in my code though
[11:24:24] <tomasm-> laidback_01, I have in my JSON handling that sometimes I want to refresh just a div and sometimes the whole page, so sometimes I set some data my ajax handler knows to reload the whole page
[11:25:03] <litenull> maxmoore14: how are you doing your dom.. all in the same page ?
[11:25:16] <maxmoore14> no, single pages
[11:25:58] <litenull> hm
[11:26:15] <litenull> and the history is not updating when you go on another page ?
[11:27:38] <litenull> i think your overcoding the thing, i have that feeling :)
[11:28:01] <maxmoore14> ha
[11:28:50] <litenull> do a blank template with the navigation to different pages and check the history, then check what thing is messing
[11:29:03] <maxmoore14> yeah, ok
[11:29:12] <litenull> do you have any JS errors in the console ?
[11:29:24] <litenull> which jquery are you using ?
[11:29:50] <litenull> i suggest 1.8.3 and jquery mobile 1.2.0
[11:32:58] <maxmoore14> litenull: no JS errors, using 1.9.0 & 1.3.0
[11:33:01] <maxmoore14> rc1
[11:33:15] <litenull> maxmoore14: could you try the stable versions ?
[11:33:22] <litenull> 1.8.3 and 1.2.0
[11:33:35] <maxmoore14> yeah, good idea
[11:35:36] <Nisse> Can anyone advice me as to why images are downloaded in the network even though i am filtering them out in the datafilter? http://pastebin.com/4m3J5j5b
[11:36:32] <maxmoore14> litenull: same issue
[11:37:04] <litenull> maxmoore14: dunno.. id have to see the code.. however do a blank thing and see whats going on
[11:37:17] <maxmoore14> will do that now
[11:46:54] <Nisse> No one here that knows how ajax datafilter works?
[11:49:28] <andrewSC> hi all
[11:49:58] <Guest95824> what do you call a website that allows you to build animations and then copy the code? I can't think
[11:50:20] <Guest95824> trying to search google for it
[11:50:42] <Nisse> Guest95824: Um, css3 animations generator
[11:50:47] <Guest95824> THANKS
[11:50:59] <andrewSC> I've been trying to figure a way to handle this but every once in a while an ajax request i make to a server side resource will come back with a 403 error.  Simple enough, just have the user log back in.  My question is how to i effectively catch and contain the error this ajax request makes without defining a global ajaxError function for the document?
[11:51:16] <andrewSC> do i*
[11:51:22] <andrewSC> I* lol wow
[11:52:07] <andrewSC> I've tried the .fail function for the ajax request and that's great for catching it but the chrome developers console still shows the error
[11:53:11] <gnarf> i think dev console just shows 4xx 5xx requests by default
[11:53:15] <gnarf> its not like something you turn off
[11:53:19] <andrewSC> guh
[11:53:24] <andrewSC> -__________-
[11:53:56] <gnarf> it's just a link to the request in the network tab yeah?
[11:53:59] <gnarf> not like a javascript error?
[11:54:37] <andrewSC> gnarf: yeah it's not a coding error just a GET error
[11:55:18] <andrewSC> so maybe the solution here is to check if the session is valid before making the request?
[11:55:51] <gnarf> solution for what?
[11:56:21] <andrewSC> gnarf: how to solve the ajax request from failing/showing the 403
[11:56:21] <gnarf> removing a warning about a 403?  That's not a bad thing, and as long as your code handles the 403 properly, who cares.  Chrome is just telling you there was a 403
[11:56:29] <andrewSC> yeah i know
[11:56:37] <gnarf> doing 2 ajax requests is not a better solution
[11:56:38] <gnarf> :)
[11:56:40] <andrewSC> but i'd rather not show the 403 at all
[11:56:54] <gnarf> to someone with the dev console open?
[11:57:01] <gnarf> thats like... you? your team?
[11:57:40] <andrewSC> gnarf: well, I'd like to fail gracefully for a 403 not just have the 403 show up and make people panic
[11:57:49] <gnarf> "people" ?
[11:57:58] <andrewSC> gnarf: my dev members
[11:58:09] <andrewSC> my dev team*
[11:58:14] <systemfault> lol
[11:58:17] <andrewSC> people working on this code*
[11:58:23] <systemfault> andern: Fire them?
[11:58:28] <systemfault> Err andrewSC
[11:58:29] <gnarf> window.console && console.log( "Handled the 403 - DON'T PANIC!" ); ?
[11:58:37] <ravenzz> yeah
[11:59:04] <systemfault> ?js console.log("Don't worry bro…");
[11:59:04] <ravenzz> create a landing page that says "you are fired!"
[11:59:06] <bot-t> systemfault: "Don't worry bro…"
[11:59:07] <andrewSC> That doesn't seem as graceful as it could be
[11:59:16] <andrewSC> :P
[11:59:22] <scar> I have a dialog that gets created and has a lot of content so the dialog has a scroll. im trying to have a trigger at the top of the dialog (in the content area) force the dialog to scroll to a specific spot. im using the same method i used to scroll the actual website outside of a dialog and it works fine... my question is, why wouldnt this work? http://pastebin.com/FHg8nK3c
[11:59:29] <scar> i even used html, body as well
[11:59:34] <systemfault> andrewSC: If your devs don't know what a 403 is… they deserve to work at McDonalds
[11:59:40] <gnarf> andrewSC: console logs all non success requests generated by the page
[12:00:02] <gnarf> so if it's a 403, which seems like a super sane way to handle it
[12:00:12] <gnarf> it gets logged
[12:00:33] <gnarf> so long as you have an error handler attached to the promise that deals with it
[12:01:08] <gnarf> you may want to log a "hey, we handled that last error just fine" message to not.... scare? .... other devs?
[12:03:16] <andrewSC> gnarf: this 403 is preventable is what i'm trying to get at, I think if it was more serious I'd let the error slide but i can do things locally to prevent the ajax request that returns the 403 from executing in the first place
[12:03:54] <andrewSC> I was just curious if there was an option that I had missed from the docs or something undocumented that others knew about in handling a 403 so the dev console doesn't give you this big red line and all that crap
[12:04:04] <andrewSC> excuse the language*
[12:07:22] <scar> Has anyone used scrollTop or something similar inside a dialog?
[12:07:24] <gnarf> andrewSC: what i'm getting at is doing 2 ajax requests for every valid request to avoid a console warning on a http error response is wasteful
[12:08:09] <NoiseEee> andrewSC: most people don't have a console open, and if they do, who cares what they see (ie: they're used to seeing a bunch of crap anyways)
[12:08:56] <ravenzz> does window.onerror catch those kind of errors?
[12:09:09] <gnarf> ravenzz: i don't believe so
[12:09:37] <jamiejackson> hi folks. how do i select A when any of its children match B? i want to do something to a fieldset when it has any checkbox children who that are checked. i know this isn't right, because i want the fieldset, itself:	$( "fieldset.variable-based-filter-fieldset").find("input:checked").css('background-color', 'blue');
[12:10:25] <gnarf> `api :has
[12:10:29] <b-ot> gnarf: :has() Selector: Selects elements which contain at least one element that matches the specified selector. http://api.jquery.com/has-selector/
[12:10:35] <gnarf> jamiejackson: or
[12:10:36] <BillCriswell> $('fieldset:has(:checked)')
[12:10:56] <jamiejackson> great, thanks!
[12:11:31] <gnarf> note that that selector doesn't work in CSS
[12:12:19] <gnarf> $("fieldset :checked").closest("fieldset"); is another way to get at it
[12:12:24] <ravenzz> andrewSC anyway you can always console.log or (ajax) errors, I don't know if someone mentioned that
[12:13:30] <ravenzz> console.log('^^^^^^^^^^^^^ don't go panic for that ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^');
[12:13:35] <jamiejackson> got it, thanks
[12:17:24] <asdf12> whats the best way to append text as is to a textarea with .append() ?
[12:18:04] <asdf12> $('textarea').append('<html></html>'); will not append anything... anyway to just tell jquery its a plain string?
[12:18:20] <andrewSC> gnarf: oh no I agree, I wouldn't be making 2 requests because everything I need I already have locally (i.e. cookies, js objects, etc) it's just a matter of is this a "good enough" approach to preventing the ajax request that 403's in the first place, or do I just let it go?
[12:19:45] <maxmoore14> litenull: if you are curious, I got it resolved, thanks again for the help
[12:20:02] <litenull> maxmoore14: np :)
[12:20:40] <NoiseEee> asdf12: <textarea>s have values
[12:20:56] <gnarf> andrewSC: personal vote, if you are already handling the 403 properly, let it go
[12:21:08] <andrewSC> gnarf: fair enough
[12:21:11] <maxmoore14> litenull: do you have a second for a totally different question? I'm working on extending the dialog widget and I have a v1.9 inheritance question.
[12:21:22] <gnarf> write less
[12:21:24] <gnarf> right?

[12:23:50] <asdf12> NoiseEee: yea but i don't think its efficient to use .val()
[12:24:00] <gnarf> litenull: yeah, just givin ya the bot-fu
[12:24:09] <maxmoore14> I am inheriting from $.mobile.dialog
[12:24:10] <NoiseEee> asdf12: to set the value of a textarea????
[12:24:24] <litenull> :))
[12:24:24] <asdf12> yes
[12:24:31] <asdf12> for my use case it isn't
[12:24:32] <NoiseEee> asdf12: yeah you/re uh, uncorrect.
[12:24:37] <maxmoore14> it is working fine
[12:25:08] <maxmoore14> my question is, in the close method, I commented out a few different calls with _super
[12:25:30] <maxmoore14> I'm wondering if I should be using one of them now, and if not, why not?
[12:25:34] <asdf12> NoiseEee: $('textarea').val($('textarea').val() + newStuff) <---------- if textarea is hundreds of lines long, yea it's inefficient
[12:26:04] <maxmoore14> I feel like I should be able to call this._super('close') but it doesn't work
[12:26:12] <DukeDrake> hm
[12:26:13] <BillCriswell> Having fun NoiseEee?
[12:26:14] <NoiseEee> asdf12: ....
[12:26:24] <maxmoore14> whereas this.element.dialog('close') does
[12:26:26] <DukeDrake> myul.children('ul') doesn't work somehow
[12:26:31] <tab1293> can anyone tell me why this ajax timeout is not working? http://pastebin.ca/2311260 instead of making the request every 3 seconds it just makes it continously
[12:26:37] <DukeDrake> it returns 'null'
[12:26:42] <maxmoore14> as does $mobile.back()
[12:26:49] <maxmoore14> http://jsfiddle.net/UdaaE/
[12:26:52] <DukeDrake> myul.find('ul') works however
[12:26:58] <asdf12> NoiseEee: thats your response?
[12:27:09] <NoiseEee> asdf12: yes, thats my response.  best of luck.
[12:27:36] <BillCriswell> tab1293: You're doing that wrong bud.
[12:27:39] <asdf12> i mean if i'm wrong, i'd like to be told why instead of i'm wrong
[12:27:49] <asdf12> because that doesn't help me much
[12:27:53] <tab1293> BillCriswell: how so?
[12:28:24] <BillCriswell> tab1293: timeout there just means it'll timeout after 3 seconds, not fire repeatedly.
[12:28:45] <tab1293> BillCriswell: ok hold on let me try to fix it
[12:28:46] <zorph> possible to output ajax request as html is partially available? or only after entire ajax request completes..
[12:28:52] <gnarf> tab1293: complete: function() { setTimeout( pollClient, 3000 ); }
[12:29:14] <zorph> let's say the ajax request has a big loop...can I output the results as they arrive...so user isn't waiting long
[12:29:17] <gnarf> though i would suggest switching to
[12:29:32] <gnarf> $.ajax().always(function() { setTimeout( pollClient, 3000 });
[12:29:53] <gnarf> with the proper amount of )'s of course
[12:29:57] <gnarf> excuse the air code
[12:30:08] <BillCriswell> zorph: I don't believe so. You would need to get them one at a time.
[12:30:33] <BillCriswell> zorph: What's the result? JSON?
[12:30:41] <tab1293> http://pastebin.ca/2311261 works like a charm. thanks
[12:30:54] <gnarf> zorph: you'd have to paginate in your ajax requests, you can't inspect the request body until it finishes
[12:30:58] <tab1293> is there anyway to keep the same connection open though instead of making another ajax request everytime?
[12:31:08] <tab1293> thats what i was trying to accomplish with the first
[12:31:09] <zorph> it's html result..hmm..
[12:31:20] <zorph> annoying that html ajax request can't stream
[12:31:42] <tab1293> BillCriswell and gnarf ^
[12:32:05] <gnarf> tab1293: nothing off the top of my head, but if you remove the timeout option it will hold that request open as long as it can before it fails
[12:32:21] <gnarf> i think the Keep-Alive headers will be respected by ajax as well
[12:32:30] <gnarf> but most servers don't handle keep alive anyway
[12:32:58] <gnarf> its all very strange and i haven't done much research on it, maybe someone else has
[12:33:18] <tab1293> gnarf: do you think its pretty bad if multiple clients are constantly making http requests to the server like that?
[12:33:30] <zorph> perhaps that's the future...streaming html request as output is found...
[12:33:36] <zorph> instead of complete request page
[12:33:50] <BillCriswell> Putting incomplete HTML into the DOM sounds risky.
[12:34:05] <asdf12> NoiseEee: here you go instead of just telling you what i -think- , here's proof http://jsperf.com/val-vs-append-jquery
[12:34:21] <litenull> zorph: have you heard of websockets ?
[12:34:31] <zorph> litenull nope
[12:34:38] <doughj3> Anyone familiar with tablesorter? Do you have to use an id selector for that?
[12:34:46] <gnarf> tab1293: i think you should ask yourself how well apache/nginx/php/node/whatever server side will handle _____ concurrently open http requests, memory impact, max clients, etc
[12:35:01] <raj> when I get an error in IE, I don't get a traceback so I can follow the stack back to my own code
[12:35:06] <raj> i just get the jquery line error
[12:35:10] <asdf12> BillCriswell: you should take a look too http://jsperf.com/val-vs-append-jquery
[12:35:26] <zorph> perhaps I can ajax the first 10 results...then load the remainder.so users don't get impatient
[12:35:27] <BillCriswell> Oh yeah I should?
[12:35:39] <litenull> zorph: thats what youre looking for, check out http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket
[12:35:49] <g0rd0n> i have a problem with jquery 1.9... basically until 1.8 i was using .live( to bind to the click event of my "tbody tr", then i had a .live( on "tbody tr a" whhich did an event.stopPropagation, so i could avoid the clicking event to fire if i clicked on a link inside that tr... however since switching to .on(, that no longer works... any ideas on how i can fix this?
[12:35:52] <asdf12> yes, don't be so dismissive next time someone makes a claim that you don't agree with, instead explain or provide proof
[12:36:30] <BillCriswell> asdf12: I didn't say anything to you.
[12:36:43] <asdf12> my fault then
[12:36:58] <gnarf> asdf12: that test doesn't empty textarea between iterations
[12:37:10] <NoiseEee> asdf12: obviously its slower, your val() test is reading every time it writes
[12:37:12] <tab1293> gnarf: I don't know how to test how well the server will handle the load
[12:37:36] <asdf12> i explained my use case, i need to keep adding text to a big textarea with multiple lines
[12:37:53] <gnarf> also
[12:37:54] <gnarf> try
[12:38:07] <gnarf> .val( function( index, value ) { return value + '....'; } )
[12:38:12] <BillCriswell> asdf12: I'd also make sure .val() returns it properly in other browsers and the browser sends it properly. .val() is just a safer bet.
[12:38:14] <gnarf> also
[12:38:24] <gnarf> take the time of selecting "textarea" out of the iterations
[12:38:45] <gnarf> set it up in the prep
[12:38:50] <asdf12> ok
[12:39:09] <gnarf> but yeah, .val() is how you should edit textarea
[12:39:17] <gnarf> performance is kinda secondary to that fact
[12:39:36] <gnarf> also
[12:39:42] <gnarf> try another case
[12:39:45] <NoiseEee> i'd be worried about performance if you were doing it hundreds of times
[12:39:51] <NoiseEee> or thousands
[12:39:52] <gnarf> $textarea[0].value += "....";
[12:40:05] <BillCriswell> over optimization is no fun.
[12:40:10] <gnarf> even the slow case with the selector has a perf of 238ops/sec
[12:40:15] <NoiseEee> otherwise the performance is pretty much imperceptible and you update <form> elements by changing their val()
[12:42:33] <gnarf> :s/form/textarea/
[12:44:03] <_br_> does anyone know how to get the current state (what window is showing at the moment) in jquery impromptu ?
[12:44:45] <asdf12> gnarf: http://jsperf.com/val-vs-append-jquery i didn't reset textarea, because my point was that it needs to handle textarea growing as well? besides the textarea setup isn't even that big
[12:49:05] <rewt493> Hi, quick jQuery Mobile question. How do I redisplay (theme) the navbar after manually setting the html content? http://jsfiddle.net/ZsSHE/206/
[12:49:25] <rewt493> Whoops, meant this link: http://jsfiddle.net/ZsSHE/207/
[12:49:40] <gnarf> asdf12: how often do you plan on doing this?
[12:49:53] <gnarf> asdf12: editing the value of a form input is what you're supposed to do
[12:50:05] <gnarf> kinda secondary to the perf aspects of using append on a textarea
[12:50:37] <_br_> wow impromptu drives me nuts
[12:51:08] <_br_> how the do I execute exactly once a function call and now for all the states at the same time ..
[12:53:56] <t4nkd> hey jquery, is there any event associated with clicking an anchor with an ID href?

[13:13:16] <Pnoexz> hey, i have an element in a variable (lets say foo).. how can i select elements within foo? i remember something like foo.$('span') but thats not it
[13:13:32] <ravenzz> with find()
[13:13:36] <ravenzz> ?find @ Pnoexz
[13:13:37] <bot-t> Pnoexz, .find(selector): Get the descendants of each element in the current set of matched elements, filtered by a selector, jQuery object, or element. http://api.jquery.com/find/
[13:13:45] <freedrull> is .on('submit',handler) equivalent to .submit(handler) ?

[13:24:10] <kripster> man this is gonna sound crazy, but can anyone tell me why when i try to adjust the width of this dropdown it doesn't work on bb10 which is using chrome? plus, why is there two dropdowns, weird http://jsfiddle.net/pnS87/77/?? thanks
[13:25:45] <bil`> maxmoore14: what links? also thats a css issue and this is jquery
[13:26:00] <Pnoexz> might be even html
[13:26:09] <maxmoore14> take a look at http://jsfiddle.net/XcZVj/ please - it is a jqm theme issue
[13:26:25] <maxmoore14> the terms of use & privacy links
[13:26:27] <Pnoexz> its because you are using the label in a wrong way (i believe)
[13:26:58] <cyro> I have a question about how to store JSON responses with $.getJSON
[13:26:59] <Pnoexz> maxmoore14: his point is there is no jquery code on your example, we cant help with other things besides jquery
[13:27:07] <Pnoexz> cyro: dont ask to ask, just ask
[13:27:19] <cyro> ok
[13:27:25] <cyro> So i have an array of urls
[13:27:27] <maxmoore14> Pnoexz: that's not correct, jqm is loaded
[13:27:44] <cyro> and I want to store all of the json responses into an array
[13:27:47] <Pnoexz> maxmoore14: thats not whats causing your issue
[13:27:49] <maxmoore14> the issue is that it is perfectly valid html
[13:27:57] <Pnoexz> cyro: try to put your question in a single line
[13:28:05] <maxmoore14> the theme gets applied and turns checkboxes into buttons
[13:28:09] <cyro> i basically want the data that you get when you do $.getJSON(url, function(data) { return data; });
[13:28:30] <cyro> pnoexz: k
[13:28:31] <maxmoore14> so that they are easier to check on a touch device
[13:28:46] <maxmoore14> but in doing so it is wrapping the links as well
[13:29:19] <maxmoore14> I'd like to change the z-index on the links so they are clickable above the checkbox
[13:29:36] <Pnoexz> cyro: so do something like... var foo[] = $.getJSON(url, function(data) { return data; });
[13:29:38] <maxmoore14> yes it is css, but it is jqm theme css
[13:30:16] <mcarter> .
[13:31:15] <shoky> cyro:  var urls = ['url1','url2','url3'];  var requests = $.map(urls, function(url){ return $.getJSON(url) });  $.when.apply($, requests).done(function(data1, data2, data3) { ... all requests done. do something with data1,2,3 ... });

[13:47:47] <FunnyLookinHat> I'm calling .datepicker("show") and the widget pops up briefly then fades out - when I alt-tab or something it shows back up though
[13:50:48] <FunnyLookinHat> Ah - bug in jQ UI
[13:51:27] <shoky> kripster: nope
[13:53:33] <NoWired> I've a image with a map area defined, how can I change the color of one area?
[13:54:53] <NoWired> I try to do it with css, but I can't, it doesn't work
[13:55:18] <Kocho> hey everyone, what i want is a 5x3 grid of images. When one of the images is clicked, a draw/slider comes out below (which I can fill with html) that row then moves the next row/s down. Does anyone know of something like this? http://d.pr/i/NwjW
[13:56:07] <coldhead> why don't you just want something much easier :(
[13:56:10] <kripster> shoky: if i use .ui-btn that changes the size for some reason, is there a way to set it for only this dropdown, for example #make .ui-btn
[13:56:35] <naeluh> hey is there anyway to show webkit css rules in firefox firebug?
[13:59:20] <fission6> jquery have anything to see if a string instant exists in an arrya

[14:01:03] <fission6> thank you
[14:01:13] <epicowl> anyone familiar with the bxslider? I am using the latest version and getting a problem where all of the images are pushed to the right by ~60-80 pixels
[14:01:22] <epicowl> using standard basic usage
[14:02:03] <czytacz> i'd like  to make sure - animate({opacity: 100}, 1000) - it won't work with transparent gifs right?
[14:02:13] <czytacz> pngs
[14:02:34] <jamiejackson> hello again. I'm playing with :has, and i don't quite understand the :not:has. could you take a look at this fiddle, and set me straight? http://jsfiddle.net/gZQzt/421/
[14:04:59] <c00kiemon5ter> jamiejackson, not works like has, it needs parens
[14:05:08] <c00kiemon5ter> so  ...:not(..)
[14:06:34] <jamiejackson> aha!
[14:08:19] <kripster> could someone tell me how to set different widths for dropdowns?  http://jsfiddle.net/pnS87/81/ thx
[14:12:34] <czytacz> okay, i've made this fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/CmEjS/3/  - and the problem is that the elements show up without fade effect. Any ideas what am i doing wrong?
[14:12:47] <kripster> surely this should be very simple, am i missing the point? http://jsfiddle.net/pnS87/81/
[14:13:29] <NoiseEee> kripster: uhhh, define it in CSS?
[14:15:15] <kripster> noiseEee: i am trying to but it doesn't seem to work, any ideas?
[14:15:28] <c00kiemon5ter> jsfiddle is being very slow here :(
[14:16:08] <NoiseEee> kripster: working for me,  just changed your width definition to 100px
[14:16:39] <czytacz> kripster: you want to change width of the appearing dropdown or this bar that you click?
[14:17:44] <kripster> yeah i want the two dropdown at different sizes
[14:18:44] <c00kiemon5ter> kripster, I think you want #model-button {width: 35%;} #make-button {width:55%;}
[14:18:49] <NoiseEee> kripster: so add a class to one and style it appropriately?
[14:20:46] <kripster> cheers. so how do i also increase the width of the dropdown?
[14:21:20] <djQuery> is anyone intrested in this ? http://jsbin.com/ukixuc/12/edit    should I make a plugin out of it?
[14:21:35] <djQuery> I mean submit it to the jquery plugin database
[14:22:39] <coldhead> it doesn't seem to do anything http://jsbin.com/ukixuc/12
[14:22:49] <coldhead> but it's still better than 75% of plugins
[14:22:51] <coldhead> so sure, why not
[14:23:56] <brantje> <coldhead> it doesn't seem to do anything http://jsbin.com/ukixuc/12 << this
[14:24:21] <dogarrhea> is there a way to select all elements without inline attributes? for example, select all tags that just have the name of the tag between two < >
[14:24:31] <c00kiemon5ter> Uncaught TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'window'
[14:24:32] <fission6> anyone have a rec for calendaring, i need to let the user pick a day and time
[14:24:35] <c00kiemon5ter> Uncaught ReferenceError: remoteWindow is not defined
[14:24:38] <fission6> and show whats available
[14:24:41] <c00kiemon5ter> dogarrhea ^^
[14:24:49] <c00kiemon5ter> sorry, I meant brantje
[14:24:51] <dogarrhea> ie: <h1>aheader</h1> but not <h1 id="blahblah">aheader</h1>
[14:25:21] <dogarrhea> c00kiemon5ter:  ^^ ??
[14:25:31] <c00kiemon5ter> that's what the console says
[14:25:43] <c00kiemon5ter> so, in other words, it doesnt work here either
[14:26:07] <dogarrhea> oh. you were talking to brantje
[14:26:16] <c00kiemon5ter> yes, :)
[14:26:37] <kripster> any ideas how to increase width of dropdown? http://jsfiddle.net/pnS87/90/ thx
[14:26:47] <brantje> c00kiemon5ter that script is from djQuery
[14:26:53] <fission6> anyone?
[14:27:51] <dogarrhea> there is no selector then that selects all elements which are inline-attribute free
[14:28:07] <dogarrhea> guess i'll loop through the entire dom and check each element
[14:28:21] <Catalin-> dogarrhea I've never heard of such a selector, nor a solution to this, nor every for a reason to need such a thing
[14:28:40] <kripster> so it matches the width of the selector?
[14:28:58] <dogarrhea> Catalin-: do you ever notice that actual content is between tags with no attributes on theM/
[14:29:26] <dogarrhea> whether a div, paragraph, table cell/row, or something else, if it's attribute free, the content is probably there.
[14:29:42] <dogarrhea> i'd imagine google doesn't care about this either
[14:29:50] <Catalin-> dogarrhea I do know that :) hold on
[14:31:38] <dogarrhea> yea, google makes all its money answering questions like this, but somehow this one seems more trivial than the other ones google answers
[14:32:21] <czytacz> http://jsfiddle.net/CmEjS/3/ - why I can elements smoothly dissapear with opacity animation but come back in a blink?
[14:32:49] <czytacz> it's dumb. the function is virtually the same
[14:35:47] <djQuery> brantje, coldhead, oops had done some renaming and not fixed it. http://jsbin.com/ukixuc/14/edit
[14:35:55] <kripster> any ideas why this menu isn't increasing in width? http://jsfiddle.net/pnS87/94/
[14:36:16] <djQuery> It adds the ability for extra buttons to the close button area of ui.dialog
[14:37:15] <dogarrhea> http://jsfiddle.net/HXWt9/
[14:37:18] <dogarrhea> this doesn't seem to work.
[14:37:25] <czytacz> kripster: because u set it to 25%?
[14:38:56] <Catalin-> dogarrhea http://forum.jquery.com/topic/retrieving-all-attributes-of-a-given-element-and-their-values
[14:39:32] <Catalin-> dogarrhea Scroll down, there's a small piece of code, a little plugin that fetches all attributes, I'm guessing you can use that to see whether there are 0 attributes fetched
[14:39:35] <kripster> make is set to 75%?
[14:39:41] <litenull> dogarrhea: doest it have to be a css selector or you could use filter() ?
[14:39:43] <litenull> does*
[14:39:48] <litenull> check this: http://jsfiddle.net/xnEuM/
[14:41:41] <kripster> czytacz: any ideas?
[14:42:43] <czytacz> kripster: well, you had the second bar set to 23% in css. It means that it should have a quarter of screen width
[14:42:54] <czytacz> 25%
[14:43:50] <kripster> czytacz: so if i set both the menu to 100% then they should match the width of the button?
[14:44:30] <czytacz> which button? Are You talking about these bars or about dropdown?
[14:45:04] <kripster> the bars, so i want to set the dropdowns the same size as the bar
[14:45:27] <czytacz> if You set dimensions in % then it means you want the element to have dimensions equal to specific % of their container
[14:46:17] <czytacz> you want to make bars shorter or the dropdowns wider?
[14:46:58] <dogarrhea> that works too litenull
[14:47:15] <kripster> i got it, cheers,just need to figure out how to center text and increase font size, thx for your help
[14:47:40] <coldhead> djQuery: you should totes pluginify this, it's nice and light
[14:47:44] <coldhead> i would tell people to use it
[14:48:26] <NoWired> I get with maphilight show allways the "areas" of a specific "map", but I can't use diferent colors for diferents areas, is this possible with this library? (or with other similar, who works with html areas?)
[14:49:57] <litenull> dogarrhea: ok
[14:50:07] <litenull> :)
[14:55:32] <TotalNOoob> Gusy, I'm trying to load 2 jquery versions on a same page but without luck
[14:57:30] <martisj> how can i do namespacing on like this  ucroo.ui.FastButton = function() { do stuff... } ucroo.ui.ClicketyClack = function() { do other stuff here... }
[14:57:39] <martisj> i get a reference to undefined error
[14:59:06] <martisj> do i have to have var before each function assignment?
[14:59:39] <gf3> martisj: You need to ensure the keys exist as objects beforehand
[15:00:10] <gf3> martisj: Naively you could do: window.ucroo = {ui: {}};
[15:00:17] <martisj> Ahhh. so make an object literal of ucroo   e.g. var ucroo = ucroo || {};
[15:00:23] <gf3> Yes
[15:00:57] <martisj> and then do ucroo.ui = {}; ucroo.ui.FastButton = {}; ?
[15:01:31] <gf3> martisj: Yessir. It also might be prudent to check if the desired "namespace" exists before overwriting it
[15:01:39] <macgregor> Anyone know if the .html() method removes whitespace between <table> cells ?
[15:01:58] <martisj> like this : ucroo = ucroo || {}; for each of the funcitons?
[15:02:20] <gf3> macgregor: .html() will return whatever the DOM gives it
[15:02:40] <gf3> martisj: More or less
[15:03:01] <martisj> thanks
[15:03:29] <macgregor> gf3: what about $('.foo').html(function (i, el){ return el; });
[15:04:05] <macgregor> Do you know if that does any cleanup of whitespace between td/tbody elements to help IE9 ?
[15:04:11] <gf3> macgregor: Same principal
[15:04:41] <macgregor> thanks
[15:05:23] <gf3> macgregor: 99% of the time .html is just a thin wrapper on .innerHTML
[15:06:44] <macgregor> gf3: I see. It just solved an issue I had fixed first with a regex
[15:07:03] <macgregor> …and then I looked at manipulation.js and it has IE9-specific stuff inside
[15:08:14] <tds5016> hey. when I'm parsing xml and I do var imgSrc = $(this).find("base64image").each( function(){});
[15:08:19] <gf3> macgregor: Usually, this is all that's happening → https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/manipulation.js#L203
[15:08:27] <tds5016> how would I get the the text form the base64image?
[15:21:45] <Es0teric> when working with multiple groups of divs... how do you offset the content?
[15:30:39] <fission6> anyone have a rec for a calendar widget with times and week
[15:38:48] <TotalNOoob> okay I'm puzzled
[15:38:57] <TotalNOoob> I'm using noconflict to bring 2 jquery versions together
[15:39:00] <TotalNOoob> but they seem not to work
[15:39:10] <TotalNOoob> because one of my js is bootstrap.js
[15:39:15] <TotalNOoob> and that one requires the latest jquery
[15:39:28] <TotalNOoob> how can I wrap a <script link> into a noconflict?
[16:03:08] <star_prone> if I append an element in the page using appendTo(), the elements inside it shouldn't be available through $(".class-name")?
[16:51:53] <Caelum> how do I make a custom event, like I load elements into a select box and I want to fire a 'loaded' event on it when it finishes loading
[16:53:32] <Caelum> found a page on it
[16:57:53] <Caelum> yay jquery, you always come through for me <3
[16:58:18] <gf3> WHY DON'T YOU MARRY JQUERY SINCE U LIEK IT SAO MUCH
[16:58:18] <coldhead> aw
[16:58:59] <Gump> that escalated quickly
[16:59:40] <Caelum> I could never find a spouse as awesome as jquery
[17:00:00] <coldhead> never stop believing
[17:00:20] <jrockjiggz> one that makes you wait
[17:00:24] <dogarrhea> what about backbone.js
[17:00:27] <jrockjiggz> *never makes you wait
[17:01:07] <ogk1000_> any idea how these guys makes their text size animate to shrink when u size the browser width down ( responsize ) really cool and I cant figure out how they do it
[17:01:12] <dogarrhea> i know you all think prototype js is too fat to be a wife, but still
[17:03:01] <coldhead> ogk1000_: http://jsfiddle.net/doxaras/fjrWn/2/
[17:03:15] <ogk1000_> coldhead, just seeing your name builds my confidence
[17:03:39] <ogk1000_> did you make this just for me or you had it?
[17:04:05] <ogk1000_> it seems like theres uber amounts of new CSS3 stuff to learn/use ... any prime areas to point me towards?
[17:04:12] <coldhead> i googled
[17:04:26] <coldhead> you really just want to read up on css transitions and media queries
[17:04:38] <ogk1000_> css tans word
[17:04:40] <ogk1000_> trans*
[17:04:48] <ogk1000_> so you been dancing with the responsiveness I take it?
[17:05:10] <coldhead> it helps me be lazy
[17:05:24] <ogk1000_> as in not making a sep mobile site or
[17:05:27] <coldhead> i like this idea of building for mobile first and then adding extra stuff for bigger screens
[17:05:30] <coldhead> yes
[17:05:35] <coldhead> so much lazier <3
[17:05:40] <ogk1000_> lol
[17:06:00] <ogk1000_> do you think it limits some custom styles on larger screens/site designs?
[17:06:51] <systemfault> ogk1000_: Just a little bit
[17:07:52] <ogk1000_> any idea on best way to quote a fair price to make an older site responsive? I feel like sometimes its hard to tell EXACTLY what will be required, even if u built the original
[17:07:52] <Es0teric> how do you add elements next to eachother dynamically?
[17:07:55] <dogarrhea> what i hear: today's development process is dictated by how much support there is for particular resolution/consumer browser experience at that resolution..
[17:08:14] <dogarrhea> and tomorrow if apple decides "everything is retina display" you're all screwed
[17:08:14] <Es0teric> as in if i create a <div> with jquery, how do i put another div next to it and then a <h3> ?
[17:08:45] <coldhead> ogk1000_: i would't do retrofitting of responsive. too hard and i'm too lazy. unless the site is very simple and well done it's almost always easier to start over
[17:09:20] <ogk1000_> coldhead, I feel sometimes tho a few adjustments on width properties and font-sizes and then drop sidebar's to below single col
[17:09:22] <coldhead> if it has more than 2 columns or more than 4 levels of nesting inside <body> no siree
[17:09:33] <coldhead> ah you're braver than me
[17:09:51] <ogk1000_> well you have more exp probably and as I dive in I find its not always so simple
[17:09:52] <coldhead> i'd guesstimate how long it might take in a worst case scenario and dibule it
[17:09:56] <coldhead> double*
[17:09:58] <ogk1000_> :P
[17:10:02] <coldhead> but you need to see the code forst
[17:10:04] <coldhead> first*
[17:10:11] <ogk1000_> do you use al % for font size?
[17:10:28] <Caelum> Es0teric: $('<div>new div</div><h3>blah</h3>').insertAfter('#the_div')
[17:10:33] <coldhead> in an ideal world i do
[17:10:38] <coldhead> but in this world, usually some other cretin has fucked that up for me already
[17:10:58] <Caelum> ogk1000_: bootstrap has lots of responsive stuff built-in, might look at that
[17:11:11] <Es0teric> Caelum ohhh i see ok
[17:11:12] <Es0teric> thanks
[17:11:14] <ogk1000_> yea but thats annoying to use unless you build templates sites
[17:11:15] <coldhead> too true, Caelum
[17:11:16] <ogk1000_> no?
[17:11:31] <scott[8]> anybody have a good way (or plugin) to allow printing from a dialog box?
[17:11:32] <coldhead> it's less annoying than the popular grid systems
[17:11:32] <ogk1000_> I hate those grid bs's
[17:11:39] <coldhead> once you know what you're doing with bootstrap
[17:11:58] <coldhead> bootstrap is good for single page apps, i don't know why your prejudice for template sites
[17:12:04] <ogk1000_> I'm willing to bet coldhead and Caelum like me... have their own "bootstrap" that always evolves
[17:12:15] <coldhead> ogk1000_: only in my head
[17:12:22] <coldhead> i should have a real one, but too lazy
[17:12:30] <tw2113> too busy being new
[17:12:32] <ogk1000_> I build mostly WP sites
[17:12:41] <coldhead> too busy just trying to learn the jqueries
[17:12:47] <ogk1000_> I find it easier to start from a really simple boiler plate
[17:12:47] <coldhead> ah that's a special kind of hell
[17:12:54] <coldhead> fortunately tw2113 is your one stop WP shop
[17:12:58] <ogk1000_> that is my own etc
[17:13:00] <coldhead> do whatever he says
[17:13:05] <ogk1000_> lol
[17:13:11] <tw2113> go joomla
[17:13:14] <tw2113> *ducks*
[17:13:16] <coldhead> i use joomla
[17:13:20] <coldhead> i mean i actually really do
[17:13:24] <coldhead> this is my life
[17:13:24] <Es0teric> Caelum how would you chain that with multiple divs though?
[17:13:49] <tw2113> i heard joomla could use some users
[17:14:02] <coldhead> joomla could use a nice genocide
[17:14:09] <coldhead> for its own sake
[17:14:13] <coldhead> like a sick old dog
[17:14:27] <tw2113> but then you'd have to use drupal
[17:14:36] <Es0teric> drupal is eh...
[17:14:40] <Es0teric> i actually perfer WP
[17:15:00] <tw2113> you never come visit us in #WordPress any more
[17:15:35] <Es0teric> tw2113 dude
[17:15:36] <tw2113> do we smell?
[17:15:37] <Es0teric> i am always in there
[17:15:52] <coldhead> like jesus
[17:15:54] <tw2113> maybe i'm just not there enough any more
[17:15:54] <Es0teric> lol
[17:16:08] <Es0teric> i mean i havent used WP in awhile though
[17:16:15] <Es0teric> i've been using Laravel and CakePHP lately
[17:16:48] <coldhead> still shackled to PHP then huh
[17:16:50] <coldhead> tough break
[17:16:58] <Es0teric> coldhead i know some Ruby on Rails though
[17:17:10] <Es0teric> i just hate how i need a dedicated server to actually put my stuff up
[17:17:17] <coldhead> heroku?
[17:17:33] <Caelum> Es0teric: you mean insert some html after a bunch of divs?
[17:17:41] <Es0teric> heroku? you mean the service that lets you make a fb app?
[17:17:50] <Es0teric> Caelum no no i am trying to dynamically make divs for bootstrap popover
[17:18:09] <coldhead> is that what it does
[17:18:11] <coldhead> huh
[17:18:19] <Es0teric> like <div class="popover left"><div class="arrow"></div><h3></h3></div> ... etc etc
[17:18:33] <Es0teric> coldhead well thats what i know it for
[17:18:41] <Es0teric> i didnt know you can use it to deploy ruby apps
[17:19:06] <Caelum> Es0teric: make a loop and push the divs into an array?
[17:19:30] <scott[8]> heroku == free rails (and etc.) web hosting
[17:19:34] <coldhead> Es0teric: i believe free rails hosting was their original service
[17:19:49] <coldhead> and now they do a bunch of other crazy crap
[17:19:53] <Es0teric> coldhead i seriously didnt know that
[17:20:13] <coldhead> note to heroku's marketing team: ^^^^
[17:20:14] <Es0teric> Caelum what?
[17:20:28] <BlaDe^> Hey guys, I have the following code: http://pastie.org/private/7rlknrviwcaqlxsxhajura
[17:20:49] <BlaDe^> lines 16 through 19 are of concern, I added console.log('triggered') into togglePins and it's being triggered multiple times, that code is supposed to stop that
[17:20:52] <BlaDe^> any ideas what i'm doing wrong?
[17:20:58] <Caelum> Es0teric: sorry, I don't understand what you're asking
[17:22:02] <Es0teric> Caelum i just want to add multiple elements next to eachother
[17:22:03] <Es0teric> thats it
[17:23:12] <Caelum> Es0teric: you can insert an array of elements, or just use one big html string, either works
[17:23:29] <Es0teric> i see
[17:24:16] <Caelum> Es0teric: but maybe it's better to put them into a div with display: none and just use that
[17:24:33] <scott[8]> anybody have any good plugins for printing a dialog box?
[17:24:45] <Caelum> scott[8]: jquery-ui has a nice dialog
[17:25:02] <scott[8]> like printing printing - to a piece of paper.
[17:25:28] <coldhead> BlaDe^: can you put this on jsfiddle or somewhere for a live demo? i don't see what you're trying to do in isolation
[17:26:14] <BlaDe^> coldhead: not easily, i'll try if necessary however I think it should be quite a simple problem -- i have another solution i'm trying to make work which also fails
[17:26:41] <coldhead> i don't understand what the html is, nor what togglePins does
[17:27:06] <coldhead> if this is something to do with updating elements with slider values when you're sliding you should talk to ryanneufeld
[17:27:13] <coldhead> he just fixed something similar
[17:27:15] <BlaDe^> it is, however i think i just fixed it
[17:27:20] <coldhead> hooray!
[17:27:25] <ryanneufeld> ui.value
[17:27:28] <ryanneufeld> that is all I know
[17:27:41] <coldhead> ryanneufeld++
[17:28:28] <ryanneufeld> yeah ryanneufeld++
[17:29:40] <BlaDe^> damnit i didn't though it's a bit better
[17:29:54] <BlaDe^> so this is the new code: http://pastie.org/private/pdzvftqbrvvkhnaex64vtw
[17:29:56] <Caelum> Es0teric: http://jsfiddle.net/Q8XSn/
[17:30:26] <BlaDe^> basically when you move the slider it triggers the change event
[17:30:43] <BlaDe^> i'm trying to detect when you finish sliding (so it only calls togglePins once) however, this code is putting 23 end's in my console
[17:31:16] <coldhead> surely there is a better way to detect when it stops dragging
[17:31:19] <coldhead> than with a timer
[17:31:23] <coldhead> or detecting the mouse eent
[17:31:27] <coldhead> are you you using jq ui?
[17:31:31] <BlaDe^> Nope
[17:31:37] <coldhead> i see
[17:31:50] <coldhead> i withdraw my suggestions then
[17:32:05] <BlaDe^> heh
[17:32:20] <BlaDe^> i didnt wanna bloat with jquery ui but maybe i will
[17:32:40] <coldhead> gross http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5165579/onchange-event-for-html5-range
[17:32:46] <Caelum> people worry about 'bloat' when people have 100mbps internet connections
[17:33:00] <coldhead> other people are using your same technique
[17:33:06] <BlaDe^> I don't have a 100mbps connection
[17:33:12] <Es0teric> oh wow i had a heroku account and i forgot abou tit
[17:33:14] <Es0teric> *about it
[17:33:15] <Es0teric> lol
[17:33:17] <BlaDe^> and are you suggesting to make something slower than necessary because the technology is better?
[17:33:19] <Caelum> Es0teric: did you see my fiddle
[17:33:27] <Es0teric> yeah, checking it now Caelum
[17:33:48] <ogk1000_> coldhead, would you say there is some sort of standard for breakpoints on responsive?
[17:34:04] <ogk1000_> I see a lot of ppl do like 960, 600, 480
[17:34:07] <BlaDe^> coldhead:  maybe it's an issue with the plugin .. hmm
[17:34:15] <ogk1000_> I like 990, 750, 480 - thoughts>?
[17:34:20] <Es0teric> Caelum ok i see that but my thing is i am trying to generate this in a $.each()
[17:34:40] <Es0teric> so my best bet would be... $('#containerID').html();
[17:34:40] <Es0teric> right?
[17:35:08] <coldhead> ogk1000_: http://www.metaltoad.com/blog/simple-device-diagram-responsive-design-planning
[17:35:18] <coldhead> i have a very similar resource i've leaned on but i don't have it handy
[17:36:01] <Caelum> Es0teric: pretty much the same thing in an .each, do you want to do any kind of processing on the html?
[17:36:27] <Es0teric> Caelum what do you mean?
[17:36:50] <coldhead> ogk1000_: i've also used something like this http://blog.romanliutikov.com/coding/boilerplate-css-media-queries/
[17:37:01] <Caelum> Es0teric: I'm trying to understand what you mean, try making a fiddle with what you have so far and explain what you want it to do
[17:37:43] <Es0teric> Caelum first let me try this
[17:37:48] <Es0teric> and if it doesnt work i'll just show you
[17:37:50] <tomasm-> anyone here familiar with jqplot? I'm having issues with dates on the x-axis. if there are any less than 8 data points it seems to duplicate them, seems really annoying.
[17:44:28] <Es0teric> Caelum i know i did it wrong but this is what i am trying to do -> http://jsfiddle.net/JKRtn/
[17:45:12] <rmurphey> Es0teric: you can't have newlines inside a string like that
[17:45:35] <ryanneufeld> yeah, it's not like php
[17:45:49] <rmurphey> you're likely getting js errors in your console if you look
[17:45:56] <khurram> hello everyone
[17:45:56] <Es0teric> rmurphey yeah i am
[17:46:18] <Caelum> Es0teric: you are trying to use jquery as a templating system, it's not meant for that
[17:46:37] <Es0teric> Caelum no i am not
[17:46:54] <khurram> im using latest jquery but unable to follow the documentation of   .live('click',function())   it does not work anymore  can some one help me in understanding what else to use
[17:47:32] <rmurphey> khurram: live is deprecated, use .on() instead
[17:47:58] <khurram> rmurphey: thanks but   i have even tried using on as per the docs but it doesn't get the element added via ajax
[17:48:00] <rmurphey> it was removed in 1.9
[17:48:25] <rmurphey> $('#container').on('click', '.element-in-container', function() { ... })
[17:48:52] <khurram> rmurphey:  i am going to give it a shot
[17:49:22] <Es0teric> Caelum ok that .html() method removes all html inside that div and replaces it with the html that is added
[17:49:28] <Es0teric> i just want to append that html to the container
[17:50:01] <rmurphey> khurram: http://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/ may be helpful
[17:50:20] <rmurphey> Es0teric: see .append()
[17:50:40] <Es0teric> rmurphey i understand that
[17:50:54] <Es0teric> but i want to append the elements in the order that i just showed in .html()
[17:51:27] <ryanneufeld> Es0teric: see ?append
[17:51:37] <Es0teric> ryanneufeld i already used append
[17:51:46] <rmurphey> Es0teric: can you show an example using append that doesn't include newlines inside a string?
[17:52:15] <rmurphey> you should be able to .append('<div><div><div></div></div></div>') just fine
[17:52:45] <ryanneufeld> okay
[17:52:53] <ryanneufeld> rmurphey++
[17:54:07] <BlaDe^> ok i used jquery ui slider and it worked great
[17:54:12] <BlaDe^> One final issue though, i have this code: http://pastie.org/private/gwasgeo2zzzzw5plsqig
[17:54:37] <BlaDe^> however, if setting the slider to 1 day it shows 528 gmap pins, there should only be 239 ..... Can anyone see an issue with my logic/calculation?
[17:55:29] <Es0teric> rmurphey -> http://jsfiddle.net/JKRtn/4/
[17:56:06] <Caelum> Es0teric: http://jsfiddle.net/JKRtn/6/
[17:56:15] <ryanneufeld> `demo @ BlaDe^
[17:56:25] <ryanneufeld> ?demo @BlaDe^
[17:57:02] <Es0teric> Caelum ok... no not like that, i want to dynamically generate that block on the fly... because i will be inserting data
[17:57:27] <Caelum> Es0teric: that's exactly what I'm doing
[17:57:38] <ryanneufeld> Es0teric: Uncaught ReferenceError: v is not defined
[17:57:51] <Es0teric> ryanneufeld of course v is not defined.. thats from my data
[17:57:51] <Es0teric> -_-
[17:58:05] <ryanneufeld> ...
[17:58:15] <Es0teric> Caelum no you already preloaded the html
[17:58:16] <rmurphey> Es0teric: http://jsfiddle.net/bYqac/
[17:58:23] <rmurphey> just use append like that
[17:58:26] <Caelum> Es0teric: notice I'm putting values into the html
[17:58:44] <rmurphey> er, http://jsfiddle.net/bYqac/1/
[17:59:26] <Es0teric> Caelum yes i saw you putting the values into the html but thats not what i wanted
[17:59:32] <rmurphey> Es0teric: ^
[17:59:35] <ryanneufeld> Caelum: cloning something with an ID and then adding it to the DOM... lol wut?
[17:59:54] <Es0teric> rmurphey i will try your solution
[17:59:55] <Es0teric> sec
[17:59:57] <Caelum> ryanneufeld: what about it?
[18:00:12] <ryanneufeld> id's are unique, and you're cloning it...
[18:00:16] <rmurphey> Es0teric: if this is what you're doing, though, you are indeed using jquery for templating, and you should look into a templating lib
[18:00:29] <Caelum> ryanneufeld: yeah I guess you have to replace the id
[18:00:31] <Es0teric> rmurphey yeah but this is just for one page
[18:00:37] <Es0teric> i dont think i need a lib just for one page
[18:00:54] <Caelum> ryanneufeld: the technique makes sense though
[18:01:03] <ryanneufeld> Es0teric: it will make your life so much easier if you use one.
[18:01:05] <mwmnj> Howdy all
[18:01:10] <mwmnj> I am running into a scoping issue
[18:01:21] <Es0teric> ryanneufeld but for one page though?
[18:01:23] <mwmnj> Is there a way to get a return value from a jquery callback?
[18:01:33] <mwmnj> Here is my scenario: http://jsbin.com/idunod/2/edit
[18:01:39] <ryanneufeld> Es0teric: if it saves you time
[18:01:57] <Es0teric> ryanneufeld yeah but i will be calling that append only twice
[18:02:00] <Es0teric> in the entire app
[18:02:15] <Es0teric> so i dont see the purpose in a templating library
[18:02:15] <rmurphey> Es0teric: any chance you're using underscore?
[18:02:25] <Es0teric> rmurphey no
[18:02:30] <Caelum> Es0teric: call empty() first if you want to clear the div
[18:02:33] <Es0teric> underscore is pretty nice though
[18:02:48] <Es0teric> Caelum nah i dont want to clear the div
[18:03:05] <ryanneufeld> mwmnj: you're doing an ajax call, so what is returned will be a jqXHR object which will act like a promise
[18:04:18] <ryanneufeld> mwmnj: your callback can then modify a variable in it's scope. But you have to remember that it's asynchronous.
[18:05:39] <Es0teric> also, an additional question... is there any way to offset the items that get placed in a div?
[18:05:47] <khurram> rmurphey:  thank you so much
[18:05:49] <mwmnj> ah ok I didnt realize
[18:05:55] <ryanneufeld> Es0teric: what you mean by offset?
[18:06:15] <Es0teric> ryanneufeld as in place contents in the next div
[18:06:17] <Es0teric> not the first div
[18:06:22] <Es0teric> when there are multiple divs
[18:06:24] <ryanneufeld> `ajax101 @mwmnj
[18:06:24] <b-ot> mwmnj: Please reference the AJAX 101 diagram: http://i41.tinypic.com/etsbyo.png and these slides: http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide41
[18:06:34] <Es0teric> so if there are 5 divs, place content in div 1 not 0
[18:06:49] <ryanneufeld> Es0teric: there are several ways to do that
[18:06:59] <ryanneufeld> ?get @Es0teric
[18:07:10] <ryanneufeld> `api get @Es0teric
[18:07:10] <b-ot> Es0teric: .get(): Retrieve the DOM elements matched by the jQuery object. http://api.jquery.com/get/
[18:07:13] <Es0teric> ryanneufeld i already have a getJSON request
[18:07:21] <Es0teric> this is inside a getJSON request
[18:07:30] <ryanneufeld> I doubt that
[18:07:52] <ryanneufeld> it's probably in your callback function for handling the JSON returned by your request
[18:07:57] <rmurphey> Es0teric: the .get() method has nothing to do with getJSON :)
[18:08:08] <Caelum> Es0teric: $('#some_div').next() // gives you following div
[18:08:24] <Es0teric> intresting
[18:08:33] <ryanneufeld> ?api next @Es0teric
[18:08:33] <b-ot> Es0teric: .next(): Get the immediately following sibling of each element in the set of matched elements. If a selector is provided, it retrieves the next sibling only if it matches that selector. http://api.jquery.com/next/
[18:08:38] <ryanneufeld> ?api prev @Es0teric
[18:08:38] <b-ot> Es0teric: .prev(): Get the immediately preceding sibling of each element in the set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/prev/
[18:09:05] <ryanneufeld> Es0teric: If you know you need it in a specific div, you could use an id to match one->one
[18:09:19] <ryanneufeld> really depends on the html
[18:09:22] <Es0teric> ryanneufeld yeah
[18:09:26] <Es0teric> i was thinking about that
[18:09:44] <ryanneufeld> also rmurphey is 100% on point with the suggestion of a templating lib
[18:10:01] <ryanneufeld> you might not think you need it now, but boy, once you start using them, you'll be so glad you did
[18:10:10] <ryanneufeld> it really simplifies and cleans up your code in a big way.
[18:10:18] <ryanneufeld> yes, even for one page
[18:10:28] <ryanneufeld> that only happens once
[18:10:31] <xenaxon> hi
[18:10:32] <ryanneufeld> or twice
[18:11:09] <Es0teric> ryanneufeld yeah i'll note that
[18:11:41] <ryanneufeld> on that note, I leave you more than capable hands of rmurphey. She literally wrote the book on jquery
[18:11:54] <Es0teric> oh thats cool
[18:12:12] <ryanneufeld> ya, she's a smarty pants
[18:12:47] <tw2113> i hear she keeps you in place ryanneufeld

[19:31:45] <BkaT> for some reason i keep getting an error 'load is not a function' in my web console. i'm running the script on a local apache httpd, is this an apache problem?
[19:31:54] <randomdev> Anyone able to tell me if/how I could alter the visible_slides value on the fly based on screen size? http://pastebin.com/WbFH62re
[19:32:44] <BkaT> my guess is that the script isn't including the jquery file, i don't know why else it would say load isn't a function
[19:32:45] <coldhead> BkaT: more likely an issue with the order you are loading things
[19:32:54] <coldhead> or yes, not loading jQ at all
[19:33:00] <coldhead> check in the network tab of your debugger
[19:33:12] <coldhead> also you can enter jQuery.fn.jquery at your console
[19:33:23] <coldhead> and it will show you the version if it loaded one
[19:33:35] <rmill> khurram: Just use css, non?
[19:33:42] <BkaT> coldhead it says the response code is a 304
[19:33:50] <coldhead> so that should be okay!
[19:33:57] <BkaT> hmmmm
[19:34:00] <coldhead> are you loading jQuery BEFORE you have scripts that use jQuery?
[19:34:11] <coldhead> OR are you using another lib that might be stealing the $
[19:34:14] <BkaT> yes, but let me give you a fiddle really quick
[19:34:22] <coldhead> in which case you can try replacing the $ in your scripts with jQuery
[19:34:44] <coldhead> could it be something i said that's making you put poison pins in my bed
[19:36:19] <BkaT> coldhead http://jsfiddle.net/gqL36/
[19:36:36] <BkaT> i didn't seperate the HTML into the other box, wanted you to see how i'm doing it exactly
[19:37:01] <BkaT> the load function was working perfectly the other day
[19:37:44] <coldhead> i don't see a load function being defined
[19:37:49] <coldhead> i thought you meant $.load
[19:37:56] <BkaT> yeah that's what i meant
[19:38:00] <BkaT> but that doesn't work either
[19:38:04] <BkaT> neither does jQuery.load
[19:38:22] <coldhead> can you "see" jQuery in the console?
[19:38:43] <coldhead> load will never work unless you define it, $.load() should be good
[19:38:58] <BkaT> what do you mean see it?
[19:39:05] <coldhead> if you go to the console
[19:39:08] <BkaT> i see the get request if that's what you mean
[19:39:09] <coldhead> and type $ RET
[19:39:21] <coldhead> does it return some kind of object?
[19:39:26] <coldhead> or does it say `undefined`
[19:40:09] <BkaT> wait wait what? i'm on win7 using firebug to view these errors
[19:40:26] <coldhead> firebug console
[19:40:35] <coldhead> there is a console tab
[19:40:41] <coldhead> you can eval JS there
[19:40:46] <coldhead> it's futurific
[19:41:01] <BkaT> yes that's where the $.load error is
[19:41:05] <coldhead> okay
[19:41:13] <coldhead> so $.fn.jquery
[19:41:18] <coldhead> does that show you a version number?
[19:41:47] <BkaT> ......what
[19:42:04] <BkaT> you want me to search for that?
[19:42:08] <BkaT> is that what you're saying?
[19:42:41] <BkaT> all i see is the load() error and nothing else in the console tab
[19:43:32] <coldhead> good grief man
[19:43:35] <coldhead> in the console tab
[19:43:38] <coldhead> click at the bottom
[19:43:43] <coldhead> you will see a blinking cursor
[19:43:46] <coldhead> awaiting your command
[19:43:56] <coldhead> type alert("OMG"); in it
[19:44:00] <BkaT> oooooooooooh
[19:44:04] <BkaT> i didn't even notice that
[19:44:07] <coldhead> okay so in there
[19:44:09] <coldhead> $.fn.jquery
[19:44:12] <BkaT> yeah it returns 1.9.1
[19:44:16] <coldhead> SWEET
[19:44:20] <coldhead> so jquery is up and running
[19:44:27] <BkaT> right
[19:44:28] <tw2113> coldhead, gets easily excited
[19:44:31] <coldhead> now, ditch the `load` bit
[19:44:37] <coldhead> it's gotta be $.load()
[19:44:47] <coldhead> try that and report the EXACT error
[19:44:52] <BkaT> okay
[19:44:52] <coldhead> PIXEL FOR FREAKING PIXEL
[19:45:08] <BkaT> TypeError: $.load is not a function
[19:45:34] <coldhead> this is a goddamn outrage
[19:45:42] <BkaT> heh
[19:45:53] <BkaT> i reinstalled apache and everything too
[19:46:12] <tw2113> restart apache for jQuery debugging?
[19:46:38] <randomdev> How I could alter the visible_slides value on the fly based on screen size? http://pastebin.com/WbFH62re I have tried messing around in console with Slider94.valueof(visible_slides) but it says it is not defined?
[19:46:58] <shoky> wtf is $.load ?
[19:47:09] <coldhead> i am such an idiot
[19:47:10] <relipse> $.getJSON
[19:47:11] <tw2113> a money loaded period
[19:47:21] <coldhead> shoky you are completely right
[19:47:23] * shoky hugs coldhead
[19:47:48] <tw2113> *hugs shoky and coldhead *
[19:48:06] <coldhead> BkaT: you want something like this http://jsfiddle.net/Baj4K/1/
[19:48:16] <shoky> this is getting intense
[19:48:19] <coldhead> that uses get() which is what i was thinking of
[19:48:33] <coldhead> today is going so badly
[19:48:50] <coldhead> starting from the time i did heroin with some homeless babe at the train station
[19:48:59] <coldhead> and culminating in this embarrassing display
[19:49:25] <shoky> babe, trains..  sounds good
[19:49:41] <coldhead> it seems better than it is
[19:49:42] <rebelayercake> hello
[19:49:54] <rebelayercake> i have quick question about option and sleect
[19:49:57] <rebelayercake> select*
[19:50:07] <rebelayercake> I am trying to open a modal from a select
[19:50:09] <rebelayercake> this is my code
[19:50:10] <rebelayercake>  $('#repeats_choices').change(function(){   if ($(this).val()=="daily"){   $('#repeats-daily-modal').toggle();   };
[19:50:20] <rebelayercake> the modal opens but does not function correctly
[19:50:25] <BkaT> coldhead so you're to just not use load in the first place
[19:50:37] <BkaT> so you're saying
[19:51:08] <shoky> rebelayercake: as someone likes to say.. it works just fine in my imagination
[19:51:18] <coldhead> we're saying forget about load
[19:51:23] <coldhead> we're saying let us never speak of load again
[19:51:35] <shoky> unless it involvess homeless babes
[19:51:38] <rebelayercake> yea in theory it works perfect
[19:51:40] <coldhead> we're saying i am hauling a giant stone of shame about the load debacle
[19:51:52] <rebelayercake> but the modal opens and nothing happens
[19:51:55] <coldhead> we're saying i can never look shoky in the eye again
[19:51:56] <rebelayercake> i cant even exit out of it
[19:52:05] <shoky> maybe make an exit button ?
[19:53:37] <BkaT> well i was using load because of ajax
[19:53:41] <BkaT> so do you mean jQuery.get?
[19:54:35] <shoky> ^YeP^
[19:54:38] <BkaT> should i just tell you my end goal here?
[19:55:02] <BkaT> might help evade this problem entirely
[19:55:25] <khurram> coldhead: how ya going champ! happy to see you

[19:55:46] <coldhead> rebelayercake: http://jsfiddle.net/GEhHh/
[19:56:08] <coldhead> khurram: i have to say i'm disappointed
[19:56:23] <coldhead> disappointed to see you asking questions in #jQuery you could easily (SO EASILY) google
[19:56:33] <khurram> coldhead: can you please help me with  new version of jquery where .live is no more and i want a hover effect on div
[19:56:35] <coldhead> out with it BkaT

[19:57:33] <rebelayercake> <coldhead> thank you!!
[19:57:42] <coldhead> rebelayercake: have fun
[19:58:40] <BkaT> k i'm trying to load certain elements from an XML file via AJAX with jQuery. this XML file is actually generated with a PHP script. i want to get these text values from the XML and fill them in to the <p> tags
[19:58:56] <BkaT> that's it
[19:59:04] <coldhead> i'd be doing that with get(), as stated
[19:59:10] <khurram> coldhead: thank you
[19:59:13] <BkaT> i see
[19:59:34] <coldhead> BkaT: http://think2loud.com/224-reading-xml-with-jquery/
[19:59:36] <coldhead> that looks decent
[19:59:42] <coldhead> except they're using ajax() instead of get()
[19:59:53] <coldhead> get() just uses ajax() behind the scenes
[20:00:04] <coldhead> but ajax() may be more impressive to prospective sexual partners
[20:00:08] <coldhead> because it has an X in it
[20:00:41] <EPIK> but get() uses ajax() behind the scenes
[20:00:45] * EPIK giggity
[20:01:28] <rebelayercake> <coldhead> unfortantly it doesnt work
[20:01:37] <rebelayercake> it still will fade in the modal
[20:01:43] <rebelayercake> but i cant close the modal  :(
[20:02:12] <BkaT> $.get seems to work for me
[20:02:46] <rebelayercake> .get?
[20:03:27] <BkaT> you know i'm susprised this channel has so many people in it
[20:03:32] <BkaT> most framework channels don't
[20:03:44] <tw2113> isn't this a library?
[20:04:05] <BkaT> a lot of people on a lot websites refer to it as a framework
[20:04:14] <BkaT> i still call 'apps' by the name programs
[20:04:14] <tw2113> so we know who's wrong
[20:06:23] <relipse> what is the best javascript IDE that supports JSDOC
[20:07:21] <coldhead> BkaT: this channel is popular because the people in it are excellent
[20:07:29] <coldhead> and often, liquored up
[20:07:53] <coldhead> rebelayercake: we can't fix your issue unless we can see it
[20:08:01] <coldhead> it works in my head and it works in what i linked you
[20:08:09] <coldhead> i'm out of options
[20:09:29] <rebelayercake> javascript:   $(function() {     $('#event_from_date, #event_to_date, #repeat_days_ends').datepicker({       dateFormat: "yy-mm-dd"     });     $('#event_from_time, #event_to_time').timepicker();   });    #repeats-daily-modal class=['modal','hide','fade','in'] role='dialog' aria-labelledby='windowTitleLabel'   .modal-header     a.close href='#' data-dismiss='modal' x     h3 When does this event repeat?   .modal-body     .divDial
[20:09:46] <rebelayercake> for some reason gist isnt working for me
[20:09:48] <rebelayercake> wtf
[20:09:50] <rebelayercake> lol
[20:10:03] <coldhead> mmm, readable
[20:15:36] <relipse> in javascript how do i change the "this" operator?
[20:15:50] <ryanneufeld> relipse: you don't
[20:15:57] <ryanneufeld> it's always this
[20:16:01] <ryanneufeld> unless it's that
[20:16:04] <ryanneufeld> but only sometimes
[20:16:05] <relipse> you know what i mean
[20:16:11] <relipse> stop being a smartaa
[20:16:12] <ryanneufeld> I have no idea what you mean
[20:16:15] <ryanneufeld> which is why I'm mocking you
[20:16:28] <relipse> wow, thats funny, it wasn't that hard to understand
[20:16:34] <relipse> i bet everyone else in the channel knows what i'm talking about
[20:16:48] <ryanneufeld> relipse: considering 'this' isn't an operator
[20:16:58] <ryanneufeld> it's a reference
[20:17:19] <BkaT> you wouldn't want to change it anyway
[20:17:24] <ryanneufeld> can you explain the problem you're trying to solve?
[20:17:53] <BkaT> coldhead http://jsfiddle.net/Baj4K/2/ why do i get an error 'context is null'?
[20:17:53] <relipse> i want to change what "this" is referencing
[20:18:00] <ryanneufeld> you can't
[20:18:29] <ryanneufeld> not once it's set
[20:18:35] <relipse> sigh
[20:18:43] <relipse> the answer is method.apply() and method.call()
[20:18:53] <relipse> thanks for being no help whatsoever :)
[20:19:00] <relipse> next quiz question
[20:19:13] <BkaT> i'm feeling a lot of tension in here
[20:19:17] <ryanneufeld> relipse: you're most welcome, however, that's pure js. And google seems to have helped you :)
[20:19:27] <ryanneufeld> BkaT: nah, I'm just in a smart ass mood
[20:19:32] <BkaT> heh
[20:19:32] <ryanneufeld> relipse: shoot
[20:19:42] <BkaT> you are correct though, he is referring to pure js
[20:19:54] <ryanneufeld> `jisjs
[20:19:59] <ryanneufeld> `jsisjs
[20:20:04] <ryanneufeld> ?jsisjs
[20:20:10] <ryanneufeld> `jsjs
[20:20:14] <ryanneufeld> damn
[20:21:00] <BkaT> what does an error 'context is null' mean?
[20:21:06] <xboi209> how do i create a global variable that is made in $.get?
[20:21:16] <ryanneufeld> BkaT: it means that context is null
[20:21:33] <ryanneufeld> BkaT: I know, not helping
[20:22:01] <ryanneufeld> see, without seeing your code, it's pretty impossible to answer that question
[20:22:38] <relipse> how can i dynamically resize a jqueryui dialog based on the content?
[20:22:47] <relipse> i dont want any scrollbars to display
[20:23:35] <ryanneufeld> relipse: it's just css that sets the size
[20:23:45] <ryanneufeld> so in theory you should be able to manipulate that
[20:24:03] <ryanneufeld> having said that http://api.jqueryui.com/dialog/#method-option
[20:24:04] <BkaT> ryanneufeld http://jsfiddle.net/Baj4K/2/
[20:24:13] <relipse> actually it is dialog('option', 'height'...
[20:24:24] <relipse> but i was hoping there would be some sort of auto-size to content
[20:25:02] <ryanneufeld> relipse: patches welcome :) http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/12137724/Bug%20Fixing%20Guide
[20:25:20] <BkaT> maybe i'm supposed to set the dataType paramater in .get?
[20:25:38] <xboi209> how do i create a global variable that is made in $.get?
[20:25:58] <shoky> relipse:  it auto-sizes height by default, but also has a minHeight of 150 or smth
[20:26:00] <shoky> by default
[20:26:09] <ryanneufeld> ohsnao
[20:26:17] <ryanneufeld> shoky comes in with the save!
[20:26:38] <ryanneufeld> BkaT: really bro? you put html in the box marked 'JavaScript' ?
[20:26:45] <xboi209> i hope shoky can save me :o
[20:26:52] <BkaT> well i just wanted to show you exactly what i have
[20:27:07] <BkaT> if i actually cared about using the fiddle then yes, i would do that
[20:28:03] <ryanneufeld> BkaT: you gotta put some effort in dude, why should I care if you can't be bothered to?
[20:28:37] <ryanneufeld> BkaT: http://jsfiddle.net/ryanneufeld/Baj4K/3/
[20:29:02] <ryanneufeld> BkaT: so what's the problem with that code?
[20:29:10] <shoky> xboi209: you shouldn't create global variables, really.. maybe one
[20:29:21] <BkaT> .....i just explained why i did that
[20:29:27] <BkaT> it has nothing to do with effort
[20:29:56] <BkaT> i wanted you to see exactly what my page looks like
[20:30:39] <ryanneufeld> BkaT: k, so this is giving you a context is null error?
[20:30:52] <BkaT> on any note, i'm not sure what's wrong with it. apparently something with the .context property. maybe it changes after the XML is done loading, and thus the original .context, which would equal document, gets over-ridden?
[20:31:16] <ryanneufeld> wut?
[20:31:30] <ryanneufeld> what is bnxml.xml ?
[20:31:43] <BkaT> a local XML file on my apache
[20:31:52] <ryanneufeld> no shit, what's in it?
[20:31:58] <BkaT> XML :)
[20:32:20] <ryanneufeld> BkaT: are you being willfully ignorant at this point?
[20:32:57] <BkaT> i don't know what you mean by 'what is in it'
[20:33:19] <ryanneufeld> if I were to have a copy of that file
[20:33:22] <ryanneufeld> and I were to open it
[20:33:24] <BkaT> there is one parent XML tag, then a few children, which all have children
[20:33:30] <ryanneufeld> what would the contents be
[20:33:32] <ryanneufeld> exactly?
[20:33:50] <BkaT> ooooh information from the amazon API
[20:34:27] <BkaT> data from the amazon API returned in XML format
[20:34:46] <BkaT> or do you mean more specifically
[20:34:51] <shoky> he means exactly.
[20:35:19] <ryanneufeld> shoky: you're seeing this right? I'm not actually going crazy?
[20:35:37] <BkaT> well i can paste it for you, if you want
[20:35:37] <ryanneufeld> BkaT: http://hotnerdgirl.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/picard-facepalm.jpg?w=584
[20:35:47] <BkaT> but i'm not sure how much that is going to help you
[20:35:57] <ryanneufeld> forget it
[20:36:00] <ryanneufeld> I give up
[20:36:08] <BkaT> you never started
[20:36:12] <BkaT> ironically enough
[20:36:17] <shoky> i'm seeing it ;] from my perspective it looks like a clash of naivety and inevitable irc discommunication
[20:36:31] <BkaT> now i'm being naive lol
[20:36:43] <Whirl3d> I would like to be able to have a variation of $.extend() that allows me to limit the resulting object by the properties of the first object...in other words $.extend({},map, opts) will give you an object with the combined properties. I only wan the properties in ma, any ideas?
[20:36:44] <BkaT> it's just a bunch of XML tags with string values within them
[20:36:48] <BkaT> what else can an XML file contain?
[20:36:50] <ryanneufeld> BkaT: how on earth, could i possibly know what is causing your problem, without knowing what input you have?
[20:36:50] <Whirl3d> shoky! How are you?
[20:36:54] <BkaT> be serious
[20:37:02] <shoky> hey Whirl3d. me ok ;] sups
[20:37:19] <shoky> BkaT: he did say "exactly"
[20:37:26] <ryanneufeld> BkaT: I am being serious, is it malformed XML? Is it XML being sent with a JSON wrapper, is it being sent with the wrong header?
[20:37:50] <Whirl3d> Just still trying to figure out WordPress...lol Now I have decided to skip 80% of wordpress and just use it to store content.
[20:37:55] <ryanneufeld> BkaT: I am trying to help you, but you're not giving me enough information to do so.
[20:38:02] <BkaT> it's pretty much jsut a pllain XML file with a namespace declaration
[20:38:12] <BkaT> no JSON games
[20:38:23] <ryanneufeld> BkaT: I made this for you http://i.qkme.me/3svy6n.jpg
[20:38:34] <shoky> :)
[20:38:58] <shoky> BkaT: p a s t e b i n
[20:40:24] <ryanneufeld> it's ok BkaT I don't care anymore. see ?api ajax
[20:40:30] <BkaT> where can i paste it that actually formats it?
[20:40:37] <ryanneufeld> `api ajax @BkaT
[20:40:37] <b-ot> BkaT: No matches.
[20:40:46] <ryanneufeld> `api ajax

[20:41:10] <BkaT> you're not good for this channel

[20:41:44] <tw2113> ryanneufeld, is this bot getting sassy with you?
[20:42:01] <ryanneufeld> tw2113: yeah, little fecker doesn't know...

[20:42:24] <ryanneufeld> *you're a tool...
[20:42:34] <ryanneufeld> time for new batteries in my keyboard
[20:42:41] <BkaT> http://pastebin.com/0qqTPgrR
[20:42:47] <BkaT> batteries lol
[20:43:04] <BkaT> the 90's called they want their technology back
[20:43:13] <ryanneufeld> anyhow BkaT you're requesting xml, and you're adding it to an XML document...
[20:43:24] <ryanneufeld> BkaT: lolwut?
[20:43:38] <BkaT> i can't even remember the last time i used batteries
[20:43:51] <ryanneufeld> I do
[20:44:10] <BkaT> although that makes sense, considering i don't use any wireless technology
[20:44:28] <BkaT> but i thought wireless keyboards and mice had chargers
[20:44:37] <ryanneufeld> wow, you really are naive
[20:44:44] <BkaT> lol
[20:44:51] <BkaT> i've seen wireless mice with chargers
[20:45:00] <BkaT> you can stop grasping at straws
[20:45:24] <ryanneufeld> oh, I'm not grasping, you're making it easy
[20:45:29] <ryanneufeld> any how
[20:45:33] <ryanneufeld> regarding your problem
[20:45:33] <BkaT> to grasp at straws?
[20:45:36] <BkaT> lol
[20:45:46] <ryanneufeld> anyhow BkaT you're requesting xml, and you're adding it to an HTML document...
[20:45:55] <BkaT> yup
[20:46:25] <ryanneufeld> I don't know why I thought that would clue you in. Any how, xml and html aren't really related that way
[20:46:43] <ryanneufeld> xml is more like html's granpuncle (grandpa uncle)
[20:46:51] <BkaT> don't need your help if you're just going to be disrespectful
[20:46:59] <BkaT> thanks anyway
[20:48:31] <BkaT> i mean do you really think that you are contributing to this channel?
[20:48:37] <BkaT> is that why you're here?
[20:48:43] <tw2113> he contributes more than i do
[20:49:16] <ryanneufeld> BkaT: I may be a smart ass, but was legitimately trying to help you
[20:49:31] <ryanneufeld> *I am a smart ass
[20:49:38] <BkaT> that's not a justification for the behavior
[20:49:39] * ryanneufeld calls a spade a spade
[20:50:32] <ryanneufeld> BkaT: you're not entitled to help
[20:50:46] <BkaT> you're not entitled to be disrespectful
[20:50:48] <BkaT> what's your point?
[20:50:56] <BkaT> you're just using that as a cop out
[20:51:03] <BkaT> because you think it is arbitrary or something
[20:51:11] <ryanneufeld> you're not entitled to my respect either
[20:51:17] <tw2113> hey look, no one is being helpful to anyone
[20:51:22] <BkaT> you obviously have nothing to say
[20:51:27] <ryanneufeld> nothing
[20:51:32] <ryanneufeld> (he was right)
[20:51:41] <ryanneufeld> see, now I'm just playing it up :p
[20:51:44] <BkaT> just face the fact that you're being a smart ass for no reason
[20:51:46] <Whirl3d> ryanneufeld, don't feed the trolls
[20:51:53] <BkaT> now i'm trolling?
[20:51:54] <BkaT> wow
[20:52:00] <BkaT> this is just comical now
[20:52:24] <ryanneufeld> lol
[20:52:26] <ryanneufeld> yeah
[20:52:37] <ryanneufeld> BkaT: your xml is not parsable by jquery
[20:52:45] <ryanneufeld> see the & in there
[20:52:50] <ryanneufeld> that kinda fucks it up
[20:52:54] <ryanneufeld> it should be &amp;
[20:52:58] <Whirl3d> ryanneufeld has been a regular in this channel for as long as I have been here and that's quite a while. He is an expert and despite what you think, he's helped a lot of people, myself included.
[20:53:17] <ryanneufeld> Thanks Whirl3d
[20:53:32] <ryanneufeld> Was I an smart ass to you too?
[20:53:38] <Whirl3d> Without a doubt
[20:53:40] <Whirl3d> lol
[20:53:55] <ryanneufeld> see, no one is special, I don't pick on anyone.
[20:53:59] <ryanneufeld> it's not personal BkaT
[20:54:15] <BkaT> you guys obviously aren't going to get my point
[20:54:26] <Whirl3d> true
[20:54:32] <BkaT> so just nevermind it
[20:55:07] <ryanneufeld> BkaT: http://jsfiddle.net/ryanneufeld/Baj4K/6/
[20:55:18] <ryanneufeld> look at the console in that fiddle
[20:55:29] <ryanneufeld> firebug or webkit inspector
[20:55:56] <ryanneufeld> be mad at me all you like, but shoky actually found it. Your XML is bad, and so your code fails
[20:56:20] <BkaT> sigh i'm not mad
[20:56:48] <ryanneufeld> good
[20:56:51] <tw2113> if ryanneufeld doesn't act the smartass to me, i worry that somethings wrong like a relative died
[20:56:53] <ryanneufeld> did you check the fiddle
[20:57:00] <BkaT> yep
[20:57:10] <ryanneufeld> did you see the error in the console?
[20:57:17] <ryanneufeld> and how I discovered it?
[20:57:20] <beancurd> i see dead people
[20:57:32] <ryanneufeld> here I'll give you a fiddle that does it with get.
[20:57:37] <Es0teric> has anyone here used twitter bootstrap?
[20:57:58] <tw2113> no one ever Es0teric
[20:58:00] <ryanneufeld> no one, ever
[20:58:01] <ryanneufeld> lol
[20:58:10] <BkaT> i was just about to say the same thing heh
[20:58:24] <tw2113> now we're getting group snarky
[20:58:25] <ryanneufeld> BkaT: WHO'S THE TROLL NOW?!
[20:58:34] <Es0teric> -_-
[20:58:36] <BkaT> i see the error, but i don't know why it's invalid
[20:58:37] <tw2113> those who troll together, stroll together
[20:58:59] <Es0teric> man
[20:59:01] <ryanneufeld> BkaT: well, how would you **validate** your xml?
[20:59:03] <Es0teric> twitter bootstrap popover
[20:59:05] <Es0teric> is rediculous
[20:59:07] <Es0teric> -_-
[20:59:24] <ryanneufeld> Es0teric: you're gonna wanna find a bootstrap channel, not much help for that in here right now
[20:59:58] <Es0teric> ryanneufeld bootstrap chan is dead
[21:01:30] <BkaT> ryanneufeld do you mean how would i validate it, or what do i think validation is?
[21:02:09] <ryanneufeld> http://jsfiddle.net/ryanneufeld/Baj4K/8/
[21:02:10] <BkaT> it seems to already have the correct syntax, are you saying it needs to be validated further for jQuery?
[21:02:20] <ryanneufeld> BkaT: Find an xml validator
[21:02:23] <ryanneufeld> and run the XML through it
[21:02:30] <ryanneufeld> it will tell you what's wrong with it
[21:03:00] <BkaT> oh
[21:03:06] <BkaT> so you mean it's really just plain out wrong
[21:03:06] <greg5green> ryanneufeld, not always
[21:03:28] <greg5green> unescaped characters are valid in xml, but will freak out jquery
[21:04:03] <ryanneufeld> greg5green: no, I mean the XML doesn't validate
[21:04:05] <ryanneufeld> http://validator.w3.org/check
[21:04:12] <ryanneufeld> paste your xml in there
[21:04:17] <shoky> BkaT: and remember that even if there wasn't any parse error.. it doesnt make much sense to append xml to the html DOM. and also if there was no parser error i think you'd get the xml DOM object as 'data' (and not an xml string. bcz you didnt specify dataType)
[21:04:18] <ryanneufeld> and you'll see
[21:04:36] <shoky> BkaT: so it makes even less sense to append an object to the DOM
[21:04:45] <ryanneufeld> xml != html
[21:04:46] <BkaT> well i don't want the XML as a string with all the element tags like that
[21:04:51] <greg5green> ryanneufeld, i didnt look at his xml, but im saying when i had this issue, my xml validated
[21:04:58] <BkaT> ultimately i just want some text strings from within the tags
[21:05:10] <shoky> then you need valid xml
[21:05:18] <shoky> and not to append it to the DOM
[21:05:26] <shoky> but traverse it and append the relevant bits
[21:05:28] <ryanneufeld> greg5green: fair enough, but that isn't the problem
[21:06:58] <coldhead> guys i'm doing it in production
[21:07:03] <tw2113> you cowboy
[21:07:40] <greg5green> coldhead, http://blogs.msdn.com/cfs-filesystemfile.ashx/__key/communityserver-blogs-components-weblogfiles/00-00-01-32-02-metablogapi/7317.image_5F00_0F65063B.png
[21:08:40] <BkaT> there's no errors in the XML
[21:09:21] <ryanneufeld> clody what's 'it' that you're 'doing' 'in' 'pro' 'duction' ?
[21:09:32] <ryanneufeld> BkaT: then you copied the wrong one to us
[21:09:37] <ryanneufeld> or you're wrong
[21:09:52] <greg5green> he has unescaped &?
[21:10:00] <ryanneufeld> greg5green: that's part of it
[21:10:02] <greg5green> i tried to prettify his link and got that
[21:10:21] <BkaT> that's not what the w3 validator is saying though
[21:10:23] <ryanneufeld> http://cl.ly/image/162D2O201T0i
[21:10:44] <greg5green> except it is BkaT
[21:10:50] <greg5green> it gives you 6 errors for &
[21:10:57] <shoky> Line 2, Column 1: character "-" not allowed in prolog
[21:11:04] <BkaT> that's what i get shoky
[21:11:09] <greg5green> and i apparently worked off a different link?
[21:11:16] <shoky> how is that "no errors"
[21:11:18] <BkaT> and i get one other error that has to do with the charset
[21:11:23] <ryanneufeld> BkaT: then how on earth are you of the impression that is no errors?
[21:11:32] <BkaT> but i don't get any errors about the ampersand
[21:11:51] <greg5green> yup i was
[21:11:56] <shoky> fix eror plz
[21:12:09] <greg5green> disregard the ampersand
[21:12:18] <coldhead> DISREGARDED
[21:12:20] <greg5green> i had clicked on the link ryanneufeld had posted from your fiddle
[21:12:22] <greg5green> GOOD
[21:12:29] <greg5green> THANK YOU, SIR OR MADAM
[21:12:38] <BkaT> i definitely get errors about the dashes though
[21:12:39] <ryanneufeld> coldhead: isn't either
[21:12:55] <ryanneufeld> BkaT: so, why would you say you have no errors then?
[21:13:02] <shoky> xml'z ain't dashe'z
[21:16:28] <coldhead> i quibble with your apostrophisation
[21:17:28] <shoky> s'ue 'me
[21:18:31] <coldhead> expect a process server when you least expect it
[21:20:38] <shoky> If you book 'em, dano.
[21:29:23] <larzen> folks, is there a way to force ... myelement:active onto  an element using jquery?
[21:29:48] <larzen> as in jQuery('.someClass').makeActive() <-- something like this. using JQ 1.9
[21:30:14] <larzen> such that it forces .someClass:active { someCSS }
[21:30:19] <ryanneufeld> not really
[21:30:24] <ryanneufeld> you can add a class
[21:30:44] <larzen> so how is :active invoked?
[21:30:44] <ryanneufeld> or maybe using pushstate to push the url into the browsers history would work
[21:30:47] <ryanneufeld> but I dunno
[21:30:53] <coldhead> .someclass:active, .someclass.fakeactive { aids;aids;aids }
[21:31:04] <ryanneufeld> enjoy your aids
[21:31:04] <coldhead> .addClass('fakeactive')
[21:31:18] <larzen> ah
[21:31:27] <larzen> but otherwise, how is active made?
[21:31:39] <coldhead> how is babby formed?
[21:31:41] <ryanneufeld> ?g active state trigger html
[21:31:42] <larzen> when would this class ever get invoked? on .focus() ?

[21:32:15] <larzen> oh so this is like a finicky thing
[21:32:19] <larzen> browser specific..etc.
[21:32:20] <nullslash> Hi, could there is an error that I can't notice here http://codepad.org/NjGE25nc . I'm trying to get the response from the server and convert it into JSON. It keeps giving me undefined.
[21:32:20] <ryanneufeld> larzen: no
[21:32:23] <ryanneufeld> google it
[21:32:36] <ryanneufeld> it's a defined behavior
[21:33:49] <greg5green> coldhead, might i suggest a regex to remove all offending oppostrophes from shoky's text?
[21:34:39] <larzen> ryanneufeld:  yep, did .. says cant be triggered with JS/JQ.. good nuff for me.
[21:34:55] <ryanneufeld> so google had the answer?
[21:34:55] <larzen> coldhead: good idear. Going to use your solution.
[21:34:56] <ryanneufeld> cool
[21:40:35] <coldhead> greg5green: if you have a regular expression that can match bad grammar i'll paypal you my entire paypal balance
[21:40:38] <coldhead> it's 17 cents

[21:41:14] <coldhead> still it's more than bill gates started out with
[21:41:14] <greg5green> well, i can write one that gets rid of all text
[21:41:20] <coldhead> AHAHAHAH
[21:41:24] <greg5green> but i'd do that free of charge
[21:41:26] <coldhead> i got that one, good idea
[21:41:41] <greg5green> it works similar to "/quit" but not the same
[21:41:47] <greg5green> :)
[21:57:23] <coldhead> guys i am so drunk
[21:57:41] <greg5green> and?
[21:59:20] <coldhead> sorry, not drunk, i meant overworked
[22:14:15] <maxmoore14> can someone help me build & inject a popup w/ a listview in jqm?
[22:14:59] <maxmoore14> it is throwing an error during the refresh method of the listview create process
[22:36:39] <JamesMGreene> Anyone around who is familiar with what jQuery does and does not support when working with text nodes?
[22:45:24] <MiracleBlue> JamesMGreene: That's a really interesting question.  I'm not entirely sure, but a quick search lead me to this, which might help: http://api.jquery.com/contents/
[22:47:57] <JamesMGreene> Right
[22:48:03] <JamesMGreene> So I'm already using `contents`
[22:48:08] <MiracleBlue> Ah ok.
[22:48:18] <JamesMGreene> Basically I want to update a text node directly
[22:49:13] <JamesMGreene> For example, I would expect `$("<div>bad</div>").contents().replaceWith("good");` to result in "<div>good</div>" but it is still "<div>bad</div>"
[22:50:00] <MikeyD> i'm trying to get a jquery script running in wordpress. console is throwing up this error: Uncaught TypeError: Property '$' of object [object Window] is not a function - any ideas? it works fine on its own page, just having issues on a WordPress page
[22:50:34] <MiracleBlue> Are you unable to use something like html() or something like that to change the contents of the element, in this case?
[22:51:14] <ryanneufeld> `ftjq MikeyD
[22:51:22] <ryanneufeld> ?ftjq
[22:51:33] <MiracleBlue> Sorry if I'm not understanding.  I've never tried working directly with text nodes before heh.
[22:51:38] <ryanneufeld> MikeyD: http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide1
[22:51:59] <MikeyD> ryanneufeld: i went through that the other day and was unable to figure it out on my own
[22:52:18] <ryanneufeld> MikeyD: you know wordpress ships with jquery right>?
[22:52:25] <MikeyD> yes, i do
[22:52:47] <ryanneufeld> have you tried using jQuery instead of $?
[22:55:03] <MikeyD> ryanneufeld: well, that kind of worked. now i have a breakpoint at this line, but i dont know what to do about it: });//]]>
[22:55:06] <MiracleBlue> JamesMGreene: is there a reason you need to manipulate the text node directly and not just use a method like html() to replace the contents of the element?
[22:55:28] <ryanneufeld> MikeyD: looks like you have some html in your JS
[22:56:04] <JamesMGreene> Just looking to make my jQuery plugin as robust as possible before pushing it to the plugins DB
[22:56:10] <ryanneufeld> you don't have any multi-line strings do you MikeyD?
[22:56:26] <systemfault> JamesMGreene: .contents is for iframes
[22:56:42] <MikeyD> ryanneufeld: this is the file: http://jsfiddle.net/K9RK9/3/
[22:57:09] <systemfault> JamesMGreene: jQuery has no way to deal with text nodes directly.. you can use .text or .html to change content of nodes
[22:57:28] <ryanneufeld> MikeyD: FIFY http://jsfiddle.net/ryanneufeld/K9RK9/4/
[22:57:44] <ryanneufeld> also, why are you using window.load?
[22:57:50] <ryanneufeld> use document ready
[22:57:55] <JamesMGreene> systemfault: Not true, while `.contents` can be used on iframes it is not limited to them http://api.jquery.com/contents/
[22:59:00] <systemfault> JamesMGreene: Good to know, didn't know that.
[22:59:11] <MikeyD> ryanneufeld: cause i'm not versed in javascript/jquery and am piecing together what i find via google and stackoverflow and docs
[23:00:37] <ryanneufeld> MikeyD: try this: http://jsfiddle.net/ryanneufeld/K9RK9/5/
[23:00:44] <ryanneufeld> and on that note, I'm out for the evening
[23:01:09] <MikeyD> ryanneufeld: okay, thank you so so much for your help. i really appreciate it
[23:02:01] <ryanneufeld> np
[23:02:10] <MikeyD> and that worked perfectly. you rock
[23:03:14] <ryanneufeld> :)
[23:10:51] <RA3OR> noob question, but how do I filter datatables from url ? i have a users table and i want to filter out active ones from within a link
[23:11:58] <dblosevn> alright im beating ym brains out here
[23:12:07] <dblosevn> why would my post be undefined
[23:12:09] <dblosevn> console.log(post); jQuery.post('test.php',post, function (){ds.reload();});
[23:12:26] <dblosevn> the console.log shows the objecct
[23:12:32] <dblosevn> the console.log shows the object
[23:12:39] <dblosevn> grr
[23:15:17] <dblosevn> all i had to do was type it... post is an array {data: post} worked like a charm
[23:16:06] <dblosevn> jquery could have been a little nicer to me instead of saying undefined
[23:16:37] <RA3OR> it said object
[23:16:43] <RA3OR> not undefined
[23:17:30] <dblosevn> it sent undefined to the server
[23:17:30] <dblosevn> well a fild called undefined with no data
[23:17:31] <dblosevn> *field
[23:17:31] <RA3OR> filed
[23:17:32] <RA3OR> fired
[23:17:34] <RA3OR> fleed
[23:17:57] <RA3OR> looks like you're stressed out

[23:27:27] <RA3OR> tada
[23:27:38] <Nisse> It's impossible to stop <img> tags from loading an image source, isn't it?
[23:28:03] <RA3OR> Nisse: troll them with a wrong path
[23:28:19] * RA3OR giggles
[23:28:22] <dblosevn> lol
[23:28:35] <Nisse> RA3OR: I did just that, and i did it before ajax had loaded.. but the images still download when i check the network inspector.
[23:28:48] <Whirl3d> dbsloven, how goes it?
[23:28:54] <RA3OR> Nisse: cache?
[23:29:08] <Nisse> RA3OR: Yes, sure. should i try resetting cache?
[23:29:15] <RA3OR> maybe you have a preloader
[23:29:22] <RA3OR> which has the correct path
[23:29:24] <Nisse> RA3OR: No preloader.
[23:29:37] <RA3OR> rename images folder
[23:29:39] <RA3OR> :D
[23:29:45] <lad> any1 help pls?
[23:30:12] <Nisse> RA3OR: resetting cache didn't help
[23:30:22] <Nisse> RA3OR: Hm, will try folder trick
[23:30:30] <RA3OR> lad: no help for help
[23:30:45] <lad> ra3or: ?
[23:31:02] <Whirl3d> iad, apparently the parent container is set to some value that when viewing it on mobile causes the button to wrap
[23:31:08] <RA3OR> lad: dont ask to ask, just ask
[23:31:21] <lad> ra3or: i already asked
[23:31:22] <RA3OR> ah, didnt see
[23:31:32] <lad> ra3or: xD
[23:31:33] <Nisse> RA3OR: No, didn't help. As soon as there is a 200 response the images load in the background.
[23:31:57] <Whirl3d> i gotta make the resolution lower on my monitor (or get glasses, for crying out loud)
[23:32:00] <Nisse> RA3OR: I mean, there is no lazy load that does not require changing the html and remove src tag, so i don't think it's possible.
[23:32:47] <Whirl3d> lad, check your css rules for the div that holds the button elements.  If it is using a percentage for width, it could be that the container is too narrow and forces the button to wrap
[23:32:49] <Nisse> Whirl3d: Please don't cry out loud, it's so noisy
[23:33:25] <lad> whirl3d: look at my website http://lolplanet.net. the width for the bottom bar (blue) has to be 100%
[23:33:45] <Whirl3d> but those buttons aren't likely in the bottom bar
[23:34:12] <Whirl3d> for one, they extend outside of it
[23:35:05] <lad> whirl3d: they are in there. i can see the code
[23:35:19] <Whirl3d> they are in a div called btn-group-popup
[23:36:30] <dblosevn> Whirl3d: aight i guess lol
[23:36:58] <lad> whirl3d: can we private chat?
[23:37:03] <superware> on jQuery Mobile, <input type="search" ... /> is acting just like type="text" in terms of input handling. Is there a way to apply "seach" on a <input type="number" ... /> so users will be be given the numeric keyboard while retaining "search" features?
[23:38:09] <superware> something like <input type="number" data-role="search" /> ... ?
[23:38:42] <Whirl3d> sure
[23:39:25] <djQuery> hey hey
[23:39:30] <superware> anyone here from the jqm team?
[23:41:54] <Nisse> wtf...
[23:42:10] <djQuery> Whirl3d, what do you think of this as a plugin http://jsbin.com/ukixuc/16/edit
[23:42:28] <Nisse> Is the browser supposed to download <img> images even while they are set to display:none in CSS??
[23:44:17] <gf3> Nisse: Yes
[23:44:27] <Nisse> gf3: Damn..
[23:44:32] <Nisse> gf3: didn't know that
[23:56:53] <dblosevn> awesome if i can just figure out how to do an ext.ajax.request with post data ill be saitisfied with this drop in type plugin i just wrote
[23:57:17] <dblosevn> i did the post with jquery for now but its kinda gay being it an ext plugin lmao
[23:57:35] <RA3OR> definitely
[23:58:18] <gf3> LOL
