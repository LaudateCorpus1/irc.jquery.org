[03:04:19] <Connor___> Hello - could someone help me with Jquery mobile "external panels"? I got a issue I can't figure out. I posted it on Stack Overflow yesterday, so hope I can just link it, if not I can create jsfiddle if that is better
[03:04:43] <Connor___> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46766057/jquery-mobile-external-panel-not-working-properly#
[03:05:27] <Connor___> Trying to have the panel always showing, even when i change page. It works on my main page, but whenever i change to another or go back the panel goes away
[03:06:34] <Connor___> I created jsbin as well if that is better then stack overflow for you: http://jsbin.com/hazuyowagu/edit?html,output
[03:22:31] <sincorchetes> Hello all. I have this problem, I cannot run the alert inside the code. But, Chrome devapps does not get issue or bad work code. https://jsfiddle.net/s51jfcxq/
[03:23:37] <localh0st> sincorchetes: I can see the alert, so what's the issue?
[03:24:51] <sincorchetes> I cannot do it: So, freaky.
[03:28:14] <Cork> sincorchetes: you mean the click handler doesn't work or exactly what?
[03:28:28] <sincorchetes> I generate this HTML code inside PHP loop. jQuery have ready. I don't think that's problem. Because, into Webpage does not load at all, does not execute jQuery. Sure?
[03:28:57] <sincorchetes> Cork, When I click, I get the modal set of dialog box, but I don't get the alert of it
[03:29:00] <Cork> sincorchetes: is this code loaded statically or through ajax?
[03:29:15] <Cork> sincorchetes: in jsfiddle or on your site?
[03:29:30] <Cork> (also don't use alert for debugging, it lies)
[03:29:51] <Cork> sincorchetes: does this work for you? https://jsfiddle.net/s51jfcxq/1/
[03:32:19] <sincorchetes> Cork, I perform a loop with PHP code so generated <a files> without ajax. I push into <a> link, so open a modal dialog that I built before. However, I clic at <a>, dialog is show but I didn't get alert or console.log results.
[03:32:52] <Cork> sincorchetes: that doesn't really compute
[03:33:02] <Cork> you can't put php inside a <a> link
[03:33:16] <Cork> you can have the link point to a php script, is that what you mean?
[03:34:12] <sincorchetes> I've updated the page with PHP code https://jsfiddle.net/s51jfcxq/2/
[03:34:32] <d3m0n> I have two functions, one that creates an object for form data to pass to another function that runs Ajax, I would like to pass a file from the first function to the second. Will $(el).val(); pass that file along?
[03:34:51] <Cork> sincorchetes: that is just code to generate the html table, not the file
[03:35:11] <sincorchetes> Yes, I wanna, pass the ID with ajax, but first I want to sure this happen
[03:35:31] <Cork> d3m0n: no, you need to use formData and append the file object you get from fileInput.files[0]
[03:36:05] <sincorchetes> Yes, I generate a table with <a> link. So, when I click on it, open a dialog but I don't get console.log("Example"); or alert("hi")
[03:36:18] <d3m0n> Cork: Got it, thanks
[03:36:23] <Cork> sincorchetes: ok, so what you want to do is grab the taskid from the currently clicked link and then pass it on?
[03:36:34] <sincorchetes> Cork, yes
[03:36:57] <Cork> sincorchetes: so this is what you want https://jsfiddle.net/s51jfcxq/3/
[03:37:17] <Cork> (don't forget to open your browser console and make sure you don't get any errors)
[03:37:50] <Cork> if that link doesn't work you have something wrong with your browser
[03:40:12] <sincorchetes> yes, If I ran these, I can get <? echo..blabla over console.
[03:40:20] <Cork> ya, so as expected
[03:40:22] <Cork> so it works
[03:40:38] <sincorchetes> But, when I add into my js file, does not work lol.
[03:41:15] <Cork> what do you get if you add console.log("elements", $(".taskEditTable").length); just before the click handler?
[03:43:06] <sincorchetes> I get this warning message [Violation] Forced reflow while executing JavaScript took 39ms
[03:43:37] <Cork> so... the command doesn't log anything?
[03:43:46] <sincorchetes> nope
[03:44:03] <Cork> have you wrapped the code in a ready handler?
[03:44:36] <Cork> hmm no it should still have executed
[03:44:39] <sincorchetes> Cork, I've updated the file with current JS https://jsfiddle.net/s51jfcxq/3/ If you go to the latest alert (end of the JS), I cannot run it.
[03:44:49] <Cork> sincorchetes: forget about the alert
[03:44:57] <Cork> your code doesn't run that is why it isn't working
[03:45:15] <Cork> i wonder if it is even loaded by the browser
[03:46:40] <sincorchetes> Cork, yes it's loaded, I see in Sources section of Chrome. I didn't see errors or issues only this message warning [Violation] 'setTimeout' handler took 1580ms
[03:47:27] <Cork> that isn't relevant it is from angular
[03:47:45] <Cork> and just cause you can see the content of the file in the source view doesn't mean it is executed
[03:48:06] <Cork> as the console.log didn't work it means that part of the code never executed
[03:48:28] <sincorchetes> Cork, lol, I opened from FF and It's works lol
[03:48:42] <Cork> it isn't about browser brand...
[03:48:51] <Cork> possibly extension or profile
[03:51:56] <sincorchetes> Cork, yes It's issue of my profile, because I opened from guest profile and just works!
[03:52:11] <Cork> try disabling your extensions

[05:29:11] <nams> hello, how can I pass a variable to a function that is inside a function ?
[05:30:22] <hellyeah> you used nested function?
[05:31:22] <hellyeah> https://jsfiddle.net/hellyeah/g2qxu0Lc/ like this?
[05:32:32] <nams> yes
[05:34:54] <nams> how can I do that?
[05:39:33] <nams> hellyeah ?
[05:43:23] <hellyeah> well you can define variable in local
[05:43:29] <hellyeah> and use it inside function
[05:43:32] <hellyeah> let me show you
[05:45:15] <hellyeah> https://jsfiddle.net/hellyeah/g2qxu0Lc/3/
[05:45:47] <hellyeah> there is one more approach if you want to use
[05:46:02] <hellyeah> if you want immediate execution for your nested function
[05:46:08] <hellyeah> you can use this approach https://jsfiddle.net/hellyeah/g2qxu0Lc/4/
[05:46:19] <hellyeah> hope this is what you are after
[05:47:07] <nams> ah I'm using phantomjs and it doesnt work with your approaches :\
[05:49:26] <hellyeah> you just write js after all
[05:49:35] <hellyeah> i think { } that one coemes with es6
[05:49:45] <hellyeah> not sure phantomjs has support for es6
[05:49:49] <hellyeah> first one should work
[05:49:59] <hellyeah> why do you want to use nested function anyway?
[05:50:47] <nams> https://jsfiddle.net/1skm1t58/
[05:50:49] <nams> this
[05:56:12] <nams> hellyeah: do you understand that code?
[05:56:44] <hellyeah> let me see
[05:57:09] <hellyeah> i know about phantomjs a bit
[05:57:51] <hellyeah> what is error here
[05:59:31] <nams> cant use username variable inside page.evaluate
[06:00:55] <hellyeah> check this https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37241725/global-variable-not-accessible-inside-page-open-phantomjs
[06:01:30] <hellyeah> try to define username and password inside open function
[06:01:33] <hellyeah> not global
[06:01:34] <KnightsOfNi> How do you attach a handler to something dynamically without having to reside to use a click event. Eg. there is this plugin called editable and I want to hook it to all elements of class .comment - but also on .comment elements that are not on the dom yet (they can be added through ajax)
[06:01:52] <hellyeah> because i think username and password need to be interracted with page
[06:01:53] <KnightsOfNi> So now I do $('.comment').editable(..);
[06:02:17] <hellyeah> fiddle?
[06:02:25] <KnightsOfNi> but I need to do something like $(document).on('??', '.comment', function({$(this).editable()});
[06:02:57] <hellyeah> if you fiddle it people can help you more
[06:03:17] <KnightsOfNi> Are you talking to me?
[06:03:21] <hellyeah> yes
[06:03:38] <KnightsOfNi> I don't know how to fiddle this as it uses server side generated html that gets appended in the dom
[06:04:06] <KnightsOfNi> I just need to know how do you attach a handler to an element that does not exist yet
[06:04:12] <hellyeah> new generated elements have .comment class?
[06:04:20] <KnightsOfNi> yeah they do
[06:04:23] <hellyeah> will have?
[06:04:25] <hellyeah> hmm
[06:04:28] <KnightsOfNi> they are the same as all the other comments
[06:04:45] <KnightsOfNi> but it doesn't work on them if I do $('.comment').editable();
[06:04:49] <hellyeah> did you add class .comment inside success callback?
[06:05:01] <hellyeah> hm
[06:05:28] <KnightsOfNi> No, all the success function does is: $comments.append(comment); - comment is the html and the comment paragraph already contains a class of .comment
[06:07:53] <nams> ah hellyeah
[06:08:17] <nams> I passed it as a parameter and binded to the function
[06:08:21] <nams> works good now
[06:08:24] <nams> thanks! ;)
[06:08:28] <hellyeah> no problem
[06:08:51] <hellyeah> KnightsOfNi,  i think you can write your new generated html and append it to dom inside success function
[06:09:06] <hellyeah> KnightsOfNi,  with that way you can fiddle it
[06:09:24] <KnightsOfNi> I don't think you get what I mean
[06:09:51] <hellyeah> i may not but we need to see the code not just for me, for others
[06:10:39] <KnightsOfNi> If I just write the appended html in the fiddle, the whole question wouldn't work anymore!
[06:11:01] <KnightsOfNi> It's the dynamically generated html that does not get the .editable() attached to it
[06:11:04] <KnightsOfNi> I can't simulate that
[07:15:59] <user_corrupt> I'm trying to run a jquery script on a page that loads jquery in the footer... will "$(document).ready(function () {... " allow me to not run the script until jquery is loaded?
[07:16:12] <Cork> no
[07:16:14] <user_corrupt> I'm confused because that line itself uses jquery
[07:16:16] <user_corrupt> yeah
[07:16:19] <user_corrupt> right..
[07:16:30] <user_corrupt> so is there some plain js I could use in this case?
[07:16:32] <Cork> you will have to load everything that depends on jquery after the script
[07:16:40] <Cork> and you will have to avoid the .ready handler
[07:17:24] <user_corrupt> well, the page that will contain this script will load before footer and I cannot change that
[07:18:10] <Cork> user_corrupt: then don't load jquery in the footer
[07:18:20] <user_corrupt> don't have control over that either
[07:18:33] <Cork> then you're in an unwinnable situation
[07:19:12] <Cork> jquery must be loaded before scripts depending on it executes, else they will crash
[07:19:36] <user_corrupt> which is why I'm looking for regular js way to wait for it load
[07:19:40] <Cork> and the only two ways you can do that is 1. script tag order, or ajax parse and execute the code
[07:19:47] <Cork> user_corrupt: there isn't one
[07:20:34] <Cork> you might be able to do something like wrap each script in the header in a function (inside the script resource)
[07:20:45] <Cork> and in the footer after jquery execute each function
[07:20:51] <Cork> but ya, that's just a hack
[07:21:03] <Cork> (and at that point you could just move all the scripts there)
[07:27:59] <user_corrupt> trying the second suggestion here
[07:28:00] <user_corrupt> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7486309/how-to-make-script-execution-wait-until-jquery-is-loaded
[09:04:02] <sreed> hello. i'm having troubles with $(..).offset() function. I understand that "Query does not support getting the offset coordinates of hidden elements or accounting for margins set on the <html> document element."
[09:04:23] <sreed> so how can I do that? ex if the body of the page has a margin-left set to 8px then the .offset() will be 8px off
[09:05:17] <sreed> but if I want to center an element using pixels then it will always be 8px off
[09:06:11] <Cork> hmm, didn't know it was affected by that
[09:06:39] <Cork> i expected it to use getBoundingClientRect
[09:06:48] <Cork> sreed: could you make a jsfiddle showing the problem?
[09:06:55] <sreed> sure one moment
[09:07:13] <Cork> (not guaranteeing i can help, as i've never seen the problem before)
[09:21:09] <sreed> http://fiddle.jshell.net/sreed_dci/pffsaedv/7/show/light/
[09:21:19] <sreed> $('#ZIP').offset() left is 710, should be 702
[09:21:49] <sreed> $(document.body).offset() left can be seen as 8, but no idea if that is a reliable number to use or not
[09:23:36] <sreed> well I'm really confused now, just realized that the element i am trying to position when setting left to 710 goes where I weant it to be
[09:23:48] <sreed> so it's something else not making the popup center.
[09:23:48] <OnkelTem> Hi folks
[09:24:30] <OnkelTem> How to select an ancestor with some class set on it? I use some universal way to specify a string with it
[09:24:43] <sreed> .parent()?
[09:24:58] <sreed> $('some_element).parent('.has_some_class');
[09:25:00] <OnkelTem> sreed: so I stick to .parent() function
[09:25:14] <OnkelTem> I need to set in options to a plugin a path to parent
[09:25:55] <OnkelTem> I'd want something like: ../td[class='myclass'] (worked with xpath was many years ago)
[09:26:18] <Cork> sreed: hmm, and margin on body should be the difference?
[09:26:26] <Cork> can't reproduce that
[09:26:52] <Cork> OnkelTem: you want .closest('.class-name')
[09:26:55] <sreed> well it's a non-issue now. the problem I'm trying to fix isn't caused by this issue. thank you though for looking
[09:27:31] <OnkelTem> Cork: seems like. Give me a sec
[09:27:46] <OnkelTem> This is how it's processed at plugin side:
[09:27:48] <OnkelTem> parent = elm.parent();
[09:28:01] <OnkelTem> if (parent_selector != null) { parent = parent.closest(parent_selector); }
[09:28:29] <Cork> ya, that should work
[09:28:46] <OnkelTem> yeah, and how can I "say": nearest td parent? :)
[09:28:57] <Cork> .closest('td')
[09:29:04] <OnkelTem> no, I can only pass strings
[09:29:12] <Cork> 'td' ?
[09:29:13] <OnkelTem> I mean configuring that parent_selector parameter
[09:29:20] <OnkelTem> Oh
[09:29:21] <Cork> you can't select parents with .find or $()
[09:29:29] <Cork> you need to use .closest()
[09:29:48] <OnkelTem> I see
[10:11:37] <OnkelTem> Thanks guys!
[10:19:43] <Schrostfutz> Hi, I want to chain a one of two functions to a jquery selector using a ternary expression. Is that possible? sth like this: $(<selector>).call(<predicate> ? <func1> : <func2>) where the functions are hide&show.
[10:22:35] <MikeD_> Schrostfutz: why not just write a normal if()?
[10:24:12] <Schrostfutz> MikeD_: It's much more verbose in this case: I want to hide all elements but one. With individual if-statements I'd have to repeat the list of all elements, with ternary statements I could do a 'show if this element else hide'
[10:27:27] <MikeD_> that smells kinda weird to me, but i don't have to work on it :)
[10:27:59] <Schrostfutz> MikeD_: True :)
[10:28:12] <MikeD_> you could write yourself a convenience function and use that instead of a lot of redundant code
[10:33:43] <shoky> Schrostfutz:  $(selector)[predicate ? 'func1' : 'func2']()   for literally what you first asked for :p
[10:34:30] <shoky> Schrostfutz: for show/hide specifically you can also just use  .toggle(predicate)  or .toggleClass(class, predicate)
[10:36:12] <shoky> and for selecting all elements but one, you can use methods like .filter() or .not(), or .slice()  or others, depending..
[10:36:24] <Schrostfutz> shoky: That looks nice!
[10:38:41] <MikeD_> i'm going to stop pestering you about it after this, but you might want to take a step back and look at what you've sculpted so far... there might be a cleaner way to go... or you can just keep going and leave it to the maintenance programmer
[10:39:19] <shoky> toggle/toggleClass is pretty clean
[10:40:59] <MikeD_> sure, but a block of 20 elements being conditionally toggled could be a bit of business rules in code that is harder to support later .. but yeah, i don't know the project, so imma stfu
[10:41:31] <shoky> Schrostfutz: oh sorry, what i gave you isn't literally what you asked for - you wanted the predicate to be checked per element i guess - filter() is good for that
[10:42:15] <Schrostfutz> MikeD_: The maintenance programmer is me, so I will suffer from my own mistakes. I have little experience in javascript so I don't know the API properly. I guess my problem could be solved by using listeners but apparently the change event does not fire for radio buttons being unchecked.
[10:43:33] <shoky> when used properly, radio button uncheck means another radio is checked.. change event is fine for that
[10:44:44] <Schrostfutz> shoky: Without a deselect event I need to keep state of the currenctly selected entry though if a 'cleanup' is necessary
[10:45:19] <shoky> not sure what you mean
[10:47:46] <Schrostfutz> shoky: I use a radio button to select elements which should be displayed. If a different button is checked, I need to hide the previously selected element and show the new one. Without a deselect event I need to keep state of the currently enabled element
[10:47:56] <MikeD_> "The maintenance programmer is me, so I will suffer from my own mistakes."  <-- that's really a good thing, imo.
[10:49:55] <shoky> Schrostfutz: ah, right.. and what's wrong with doing that?
[10:50:51] <Schrostfutz> shoky: Nothing by itself, I just try to avoid shared state since it's a frequent error source
[10:51:02] <Schrostfutz> MikeD_: It incentivizes writing clean code..
[10:51:48] <MikeD_> yeah, i was going to suggest "hide everything, show the one selected" is a pretty simple approach, but there are ways that can be naively wrong
[10:51:50] <shoky> Schrostfutz: gotcha.. well using classes and a .filter()  or .not() is just fine imo
[10:53:37] <Schrostfutz> MikeD_, shoky: I worked out a solution now, thanks for your help :)
[10:57:43] <sincorchetes> Good afternoon folks, I have a question. I have a PHP backend to get some data, and this one, send some data back of SQL query. (SELECT *...). So I have an form, that just, I send an ajax when I clic to link with data-value. This one works sending the number of ID record. But, when I want to get the name, description blabla of SQL query. In form does not work. I can see the datavalues passed with alert correctly. But when I want to see
[10:57:43] <sincorchetes> in a form. I get the message "Undefined variable". This is I have. https://jsfiddle.net/u09fxpy7/
[13:19:11] <Al_nz1> robertmaxrees: I found a library to do what I wanted : https://jsfiddle.net/DTcHh/38418/
[13:21:12] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[13:28:52] <Al_nz1> hrm ?
[13:29:38] <robertmaxrees> (shrug) i hardly remember what i ate for dinner last night hahahhaa
[13:30:03] <Al_nz1> lol
[13:32:34] <Al_nz1> robertmaxrees: a bit off topic perhaps, but would the backend normally send back a html fragment?
[13:33:29] <robertmaxrees> "normally" and "good" aren't always the same ;) but in all seriousness, no.
[13:33:36] <robertmaxrees> send back JSON, render that client-side.
[13:38:17] <Al_nz1> hmm.
[13:38:33] <robertmaxrees> ?
[13:45:00] <Al_nz1> robertmaxrees: so the client needs to take that JSON and populate a table?
[13:45:15] <robertmaxrees> yes.
[13:45:27] <Al_nz1> dont suppose you hav a link to a example of this?
[13:45:49] <robertmaxrees> erm./
[13:45:52] <robertmaxrees> it's kind of basic.
[13:45:56] <robertmaxrees> what part are you lost at?
[13:47:02] <Al_nz1> well, I guess the reason I ask, is because the backend alredy uses thymeleaf templating engine to provide the table data on the first request - it seems a shame to then create a new function in javascript that does the same job - I was wondering if I can use the backend logic to just send html
[13:47:15] <Al_nz1> I dont know if that changes your previous answer?
[13:47:41] <robertmaxrees> you'
[13:47:50] <robertmaxrees> *you're basically in a corner at this poing.
[13:47:52] <robertmaxrees> heh
[13:48:06] <robertmaxrees> think of tit this way:
[13:48:16] <robertmaxrees> you're using a server-side templating engine, right?
[13:48:20] <Al_nz1> yes
[13:48:48] <robertmaxrees> and you want to use server-side rendering within an ajax call, right?
[13:49:08] <Al_nz1> well part of the question is if this is possible and if so is it a good idea?
[13:49:29] <robertmaxrees> skipping ahead too far.
[13:49:35] <robertmaxrees> want you to see the issue with the rationale :)
[13:50:02] <robertmaxrees> if you're going to render a fragment server-side, what's the point of using AJAX?
[13:50:46] <Al_nz1> to send the filter term to the backend
[13:50:53] <robertmaxrees> erm
[13:50:54] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:50:58] <robertmaxrees> so why not just do a full pageload?
[13:51:18] <robertmaxrees> if you're gonna make your backend render part of the page as-is, just have it render the full thing.
[13:51:20] <Al_nz1> I could - but the example I have seen isnt doing that
[13:51:31] <robertmaxrees> step back from examples, etc.
[13:51:37] <Al_nz1> hey, I have to tend to the kids for 30 min
[13:51:41] <Al_nz1> back soon if your still about
[13:51:47] <robertmaxrees> think about practical application of your iodea.
[14:02:10] <dreadkopp> hey guys. someone might tell me where i went wrong with the this .each() function?  https://pastebin.com/wP33Lq3p
[14:02:40] <robertmaxrees> dreadkopp .each() doesn't return anything./
[14:02:49] <dreadkopp> robertmaxrees: aye
[14:02:56] <dreadkopp> okay, thanks
[14:02:59] <robertmaxrees> so what are yout rying to get?
[14:03:05] <robertmaxrees> an array of positions?
[14:03:29] <dreadkopp> i want to get an array of positions. each entry for each div with 'camera' class
[14:03:33] <robertmaxrees> $('.camera').map(function() {return $(this).position() }).get();
[14:03:41] <robertmaxrees> something like that'll get you what you want.
[14:04:41] <dreadkopp> thanks :)
[17:03:19] <carpii> is it possible to use jQuery to detect if another script in HEAD has failed to load?
[17:07:17] <robertmaxrees> can't think of a reliable way carpii
[17:07:25] <carpii> yeah nor me :/
[17:07:45] <carpii> could add a javascript var into each script, but that only works if i control each script. And these are hosted on third party cdn
[17:07:47] <robertmaxrees> why would you want that?
[17:08:24] <carpii> a web app I have is getting complaints from some IE11 users, and the only explanation I can think of is that a script from one of these cdn's has failed to load
[17:08:47] <robertmaxrees> eh, I would doubt that would be the culprit.
[17:09:00] <carpii> why do you doubt that?
[17:09:22] <carpii> I cant reproduce it, but the symptoms are exactly the same as if one of the scripts is omitted from HEAD
[17:09:33] <robertmaxrees> because then it'd be an issue with more than just IE11...
[17:10:02] <robertmaxrees> and even if that were the issue, what does knowing that change?
[17:10:10] <robertmaxrees> still gotta fix the core problem.
[17:10:49] <carpii> By failing to load, it could also mean an adblocker is blocking it though
[17:11:01] <carpii> dunno, grasping at straws I agree, but I dont know how else to troubleshoot it
[17:11:15] <robertmaxrees> well, why are these hosted on third party servers to begin with?"
[17:11:56] <carpii> its the 'recommended way', although if I could identify one script was causing it, Id move it to self hosting
[17:12:05] <carpii> the scripts are EmojiOne related
[17:12:24] <carpii> which is widely used, so I feel its not a hosting issue as such
[17:12:48] <carpii> perhaps people on a mobile internet dongle causing problems I cant reproduce, not sure
[17:24:11] <Al_nz1> robertmaxrees: the one I am copying is not doing a whole page reload
[17:25:29] <robertmaxrees> Al_nz1 heh, not to be a jerk, but you keep asking for advice/input/feedback, then shoot back with variations of "Well I'm not going to do it that way"
[17:26:31] <robertmaxrees> in this case, you're already going to render things server-side, might as well do the whole page.
[17:26:34] <robertmaxrees> or shoot back JSON.
[17:35:16] <Al_nz1> robertmaxrees: I totally respect your opinion man - no question there
[17:35:25] <Al_nz1> I just like to fully explore things :-)
[17:36:15] <robertmaxrees> (shrug)
[17:36:21] <Al_nz1> and sometimes if I see someoe has done something in a different way to you, then I do consider I wonder if I just havent fully explained the problem to you :)
[17:36:27] <carpii> whats the issue al?
[17:36:41] <Al_nz1> carpii: we are discussing updating a table
[17:36:46] <robertmaxrees> lol
[17:36:53] <Al_nz1> whole page reload vs dynamic
[17:37:01] <carpii> ok
[17:37:04] <robertmaxrees> he's contemplating sending back a markup fragment for the table vs JSON data.
[17:37:17] <robertmaxrees> you can do the markup fragment, but that's slow and inefficient./
[17:37:31] <Al_nz1> robertmaxrees: we dont want that!
[17:37:42] <Al_nz1> sounds like JSON is the way to go then
[17:37:43] <carpii> yeah forget markup, not only that but the serverside code ends up becoming more difficult to maintain imo
[17:37:59] <robertmaxrees> if you're gonna start ajaxing stuff on your site, do it the right way.  half-assing it is gonna cause more headaches later.
[17:38:00] <carpii> since you are having to render partial bits
[17:38:09] <Al_nz1> so, just checking I have my head around this correctly:
[17:39:04] <carpii> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1051061/convert-json-array-to-an-html-table-in-jquery
[17:39:21] <carpii> assuming you really need an html table
[17:39:50] <robertmaxrees> he's got tabular data.
[17:39:53] <Al_nz1> when the page first loads, the server (via the templating engine) will send back html with the table populated (page 1 anyway) - if a filter is applied JSON is sent (via Ajax) to backend - which will return the results in JSON. The client side code then gets this JSON into the table in the view?
[17:39:58] <carpii> yup, not saying he shouldnt :)
[17:40:03] <carpii> but yknow, worth mentioning
[17:40:31] <robertmaxrees> Al_nz1 pretty much,  tho i still wonder why you need ajax at all in this case.
[17:40:49] <Al_nz1> robertmaxrees: instead of a page reload?
[17:41:05] <robertmaxrees> dunno what that would be in lieu of otherwise heh
[17:41:10] <carpii> Al, theres another option
[17:41:34] <carpii> your serverside scripts output your json data directly into the body of the document on the first request
[17:41:41] <carpii> then you just build the table from script
[17:41:45] <Al_nz1> thanks for that so link carpii - I will have a look at it
[17:41:46] <robertmaxrees> eeeehhhh.
[17:42:16] <carpii> which means you arent rendering via template in one script, then having to maintain a 2nd bit of code which builds it from json
[17:43:19] <Al_nz1> yeah I do like the idea of not having to maintain two bits of code.
[17:43:33] <robertmaxrees> imo that's skirting your real problem .
[17:43:35] <carpii> yeah theres a lot to be said for it, especially if its a complex project
[17:43:45] <carpii> how so?
[17:43:45] <Al_nz1> robertmaxrees: the real problem being?
[17:43:50] <robertmaxrees> thymeleaf
[17:43:59] <Al_nz1> robertmaxrees: thymeleaf is the problem?
[17:44:05] <robertmaxrees> mmhmm
[17:44:14] <Al_nz1> how so?
[17:44:15] <robertmaxrees> should be easy to share templates between the back and front.
[17:44:19] <robertmaxrees> thymeleaf prevents that.
[17:44:48] <robertmaxrees> you basically want to build an application using a paradigm your backend doesn't handle.
[17:45:12] <robertmaxrees> so sure, handling the same template in tww places sucks, but now you're introducing 2 places for templates to live.
[17:46:08] <Al_nz1> i see
[17:46:20] <Al_nz1> and I agree that its not great
[17:46:51] <Al_nz1> here is one approach using the technologies I am using : https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20975122/update-table-with-ajax-and-spring-mvc
[17:47:28] <carpii> never heard of thymeleaf, but it appears to be java. are you using java?
[17:47:40] <robertmaxrees> Al_nz1 lol
[17:48:20] <Al_nz1> carpii: yes and yes
[17:48:25] <carpii> ah ok
[17:48:29] <Al_nz1> robertmaxrees:@lol @what?
[17:48:32] <carpii> ill politely bow out then :p
[17:48:46] <robertmaxrees> good luck duder :)(
[17:48:49] <robertmaxrees> * :)
[17:49:17] <Al_nz1> robertmaxrees: what do you think of the approach in that SO answer?
[17:49:27] <Al_nz1> remember I value your opinion!
[17:49:43] <robertmaxrees> what do you think I'm gonna tell you?
[17:50:43] <Al_nz1> Well since your asking, I doubt your going to agree with there approach. I reckon there is a good chance you will say page reload
[17:50:56] <Al_nz1> or maybe ditch thymeleaf
[17:50:58] <Al_nz1> I dunno
[17:51:05] <Al_nz1> Its a bit late to ditch thymelead
[17:51:08] <Al_nz1> thymeleaf
[17:51:13] <robertmaxrees> what do you think my contention is with the specific example you provided?
[17:51:42] <Al_nz1> its not a whole page reload, and two templates?
[17:51:59] <robertmaxrees> just the fact that you'll have the template issue.
[17:52:31] <Al_nz1> right
[17:53:03] <robertmaxrees> so
[17:53:48] <robertmaxrees> if we're pointing out why that's a bad idea, and then you come back and say "hey here's an example with an approach" and it's that approach >.>
[17:53:50] <robertmaxrees> just seems odd.
[17:54:18] <carpii> Al, Ive been down the fragment route before, long ago
[17:54:24] <Al_nz1> I get your point about the two templates. But I am probably too far down the thymeleaf road to ditch it now
[17:54:25] <carpii> before jQuery was really a thing
[17:54:45] <Al_nz1> carpii: not going to use a html fragment - thats definitely out
[17:54:51] <carpii> its a pain in the ass because suddenly you find youre relying on css classes being present in the parent document, and spitting out HTML where the ids dont clash
[17:54:54] <carpii> ok
[17:55:16] <robertmaxrees> Al_nz1 so why AJAX it?
[17:55:33] <Al_nz1> robertmaxrees: I guess a whole page reload avoids two templates
[17:56:00] <robertmaxrees> lol
[17:56:02] <carpii> you dont need two templates even with ajax
[17:56:10] <robertmaxrees> but why was ajax a solution in the first place?
[17:56:14] <carpii> but... dont use ajax unless theres a benefit to the end user IMO
[17:56:16] <robertmaxrees> i keep asking that question.
[17:57:09] <carpii> (ie, you are doing it to avoid losing runtime state, or a page refresh would result in a lot more traffic or linger response time)
[17:57:32] <Al_nz1> carpii: well a page reload probably would be a longer response time
[17:57:46] <carpii> yes but is it a significant issue?
[17:57:57] <robertmaxrees> and are you sure you're using the right metrics there?
[17:58:11] <robertmaxrees> ajax does not immediately get you faster reload times.
[17:58:23] <Al_nz1> robertmaxrees: to be fair, at least by thrashing things out and discussing it, I get some sort of handle on the issues of each approach....there is learning right there
[17:58:25] <robertmaxrees> ajax can actually increase overall pageload when done incorrectly.
[17:58:46] <carpii> yeah, not page reload time, page update response time
[17:58:56] <robertmaxrees> or time to useful interaction
[17:59:10] <robertmaxrees> this is the lesson: stop looking for problems to solve with your shiny hammer.
[17:59:19] <robertmaxrees> start with real problems to solve.
[17:59:19] <Al_nz1> robertmaxrees: hahahaha
[17:59:23] <robertmaxrees> :)
[17:59:26] <carpii> Al, even amazon prefers to use a full page reload in many cases
[17:59:27] <robertmaxrees> it happens all the time.
[17:59:31] <robertmaxrees> ^^^^
[17:59:43] <carpii> and this is a company who spent 6 months discovering that shaving 3ms off their reponse times increased sales
[17:59:52] <robertmaxrees> brb
[18:01:25] <Al_nz1> Ok - lets give this page reload a go - so I need on my function which captures the enter key to send the form data?
[18:01:47] <carpii> no idea, but Im sure youll figure it out :)
[18:02:55] <Al_nz1> carpii: wayyyy tooo much faith in me
[18:04:39] <carpii> hehe
[18:17:13] <Al_nz1> I need the Enter event to trigger the submit
[18:17:18] <Al_nz1> really not sure how to do that
[18:17:35] <Al_nz1> I mean I can trap the enter even on the inputtag
[18:17:46] <Al_nz1> but then how to make that do the submit
[18:17:52] <taplar> enter on an <input> will typically submit the form
[18:18:56] <Al_nz1> taplar: in this context
[18:18:57] <Al_nz1> https://jsfiddle.net/DTcHh/38444/
[18:19:38] <taplar> where's the form?
[18:20:03] <carpii> Al, youre a developer. You gotta learn how to google dude
[18:20:18] <carpii> https://www.google.co.uk/search?{google:acceptedSuggestion}oq=submit+a+form+with+enter+key&{google:instantFieldTrialGroupParameter}sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8&q=submit+a+form+with+enter+key
[18:21:00] <carpii> your form needs a input type="submit"
[18:21:11] <taplar> there is no form ....
[18:21:15] <carpii> or you write a jquery handler to $("#form").submit()
[18:21:19] <carpii> yeah i see that too
[18:21:25] <carpii> but googling would have solved that also :p
[18:21:44] <carpii> even if it means building it himself and then $.post
[18:21:45] <taplar> sure, but it doesn't hurt us to help
[18:21:58] <carpii> yeah i agree, im not trying to be a dick about it
[18:22:05] <carpii> just googling is really the best advice sometimes
[18:22:28] <carpii> in terms of learning rather than just following advice
[18:22:40] <taplar> you can't learn from following advice?
[18:22:51] <carpii> not if you just blindly follow it
[18:23:01] <taplar> i learn from following advice all the time
[18:23:22] <carpii> sure me too, but only if i understand the 'why'
[18:27:04] <Al_nz1> sorry was afk
[18:27:41] <Al_nz1> I did do some googling and have come up with $('.eventno').on('itemAdded', function(event) { which traps the enter event for toe inputtags library I am using
[18:28:00] <Al_nz1> then : $('#formEpisodeDashboard').submit() should send the data between the form tags
[18:28:04] <Al_nz1> with that id
[18:28:18] <taplar> is formEpisodeDashboard a <form>?
[18:28:23] <Al_nz1> yes
[18:28:29] <taplar> k
[18:28:38] <taplar> so what's the question?
[18:29:05] <Al_nz1> well I was just pointing out I did do some googling....;-)
[18:29:13] <Al_nz1> hell - I even landed on jquery docs
[18:29:24] <taplar> k
[18:29:26] <Al_nz1> I havent run it yet so no freaking idea if it works
[18:29:46] <Al_nz1> normally I have a submit button....so this is a slightly different approach
[18:30:58] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/3hcjsrs9/  don't need a submit button for enter to submit the form
[18:31:18] <taplar> but if your library is catching enter and cancelling it, it may be preventing that default behaviour
[18:31:43] <carpii> yep, good point
[18:32:15] <carpii> but that only seems to be true if theres just one input
[18:32:16] <carpii> https://jsfiddle.net/3hcjsrs9/1/
[18:32:35] <taplar> hmm
[18:32:56] <carpii> https://jsfiddle.net/3hcjsrs9/3/
[18:33:44] <taplar> ah, i vaguely remember this behaviour
[18:36:12] <taplar> so you can just throw a submit in there and hide it in some manner to make that work
[18:36:24] <carpii> seems so yes
[18:36:40] <carpii> personally id prefer to add a key handler to the controls, and just submit it manually via jquery
[18:36:53] <carpii> but both would work i guess
[19:41:36] <Al_nz1> perhaps I should also be using datatables?
[19:51:53] <Al_nz1> robertmaxrees: you baile dyet?
[19:51:55] <Al_nz1> bailed
[19:57:52] <robertmaxrees> still around.  if you have a question, just ask :)
[19:58:30] <Al_nz1> what do you think of this approach? https://medium.com/@gustavo.ponce.ch/spring-boot-jquery-datatables-a2e816e2b5e9
[19:58:44] <Al_nz1> it uses all the technologies I use and only one template by the look of it
[20:01:31] <robertmaxrees> (shrug) don't really have time to run through it heh
[20:02:20] <Al_nz1> well I cant understand where his search input comes from? its not in the html
[20:04:29] <robertmaxrees> datatables
[20:06:12] <Al_nz1> datatables automatically gives you a search box?
[20:08:10] <robertmaxrees> (shrug) that would be my guess.
[20:12:47] <Al_nz1> robertmaxrees: ok thanks
