[00:00:16] <igcewieling> I'm a bit of a n00b, so pardon any idiocy.   I'm using the datepicker widget.  I want to allow a user to manually enter any string into my date field (I will use PHP's strtotime function to parse it) and allow the user to select a date using the datepicker instead, whichever they want.  It seems the datepicker forces only valid time/date characters in the input field.   "-1 hour" can be parsed by strtotime, but the datepicker doesn't al
[00:00:57] <igcewieling> I looked at the datepicker api docs but did not see anything remotely like "don't validate the input field your are attached to."
[00:01:40] <jphase> hmm
[00:02:34] <jphase> igcewieling: I think you can pass constrainInput: false   in the options
[00:03:36] <igcewieling> jphase: apparently my real problem is "fatigue", I totally missed seeing that.  Thanks!
[00:03:44] <consideratio> my goal: without updating url etc, scroll window down to an object with id #myid --- anyone knows how i do this?
[00:03:56] <jphase> heh no problem, I understand - 3am here :s
[00:05:32] <jphase> consideratio: yeah you should be able to use $('html, body').animate({scrollTop: $('#myid').offset().top()}, 3000);    or something like that
[00:06:10] <consideratio> okay thanks jphase, do you know how this would look without animation?
[00:06:46] <jphase> consideratio: $('html, body').scrollTop($('#myid').offset().top());
[00:07:03] <jphase> er...
[00:07:06] <jphase> that might be .scrollTo
[00:07:19] <jphase> I can't remember hehe, I usually only animate :x
[00:07:23] <consideratio> :>
[00:08:03] <consideratio> property top of object <...> is not a function
[00:08:12] <consideratio> on the first animation part
[00:08:32] <consideratio> ah
[00:08:34] <consideratio> removed ()
[00:08:35] <consideratio> from it
[00:08:36] <jphase> ?
[00:08:38] <jphase> oh doh!
[00:08:40] <consideratio> animation success
[00:08:41] <jphase> muh bad
[00:08:46] <consideratio> very sweet
[00:08:47] <jphase> property not method
[00:08:52] <jphase> it's early :[
[00:09:27] <consideratio> $('html, body').scrollTop($('#slist').offset().top);  --- insta scroll worked
[00:09:38] <consideratio> $('html, body').animate({scrollTop: $('#slist').offset().top}, 3000); --- animate scroll worked
[00:09:41] <consideratio> thanks for your help jphase
[00:09:54] <jphase> sure thing, thanks for translating my typos heh
[00:10:10] <consideratio> <3
[00:10:30] <jphase> -`ღ´-
[00:10:47] <consideratio> omg :D
[00:10:54] <consideratio> smile-pro
[00:11:08] <jphase> meh - 30 year old irc nerd
[01:02:56] <coldhead> okay good job of everyone. let's all take a short break and meet back here in half an hour
[01:03:32] <greg5green> sounds like a plan
[02:04:24] <OODavo> So I spent about an hour yesterday struggling with a fairly simple jQuery-based userscript, because I expected the .each() method to pass the *value* as the first callback argument, instead of the index. It's obviously far too late to change that sort of API detail; however, would it be worth adding a jQuery.forEach() method using the same interface as the JS-core Array::forEach()? (In particular, such that the callback is…
[02:04:30] <OODavo> …expected to have the signature function(value, index, wholeCollection).) Or might that just unnecessarily confuse matters further?
[02:14:44] <Specs> hi there, need some help
[02:15:23] <Specs> would love to have a look at the example JQMobile at: http://demos.jquerymobile.com/1.4.0/backbone-requirejs/
[02:29:42] <greg5green> OODavo, in most cases you should be able to use the this keyword to refer to get the value of the element you are iterating through
[02:31:16] <OODavo> greg5green: Yes, I noticed 'this' was also bound to the value, but that also doesn't help if you have an existing callback function of one argument and you expect it to be receiving the value. :P
[02:31:38] <greg5green> touché :)
[02:31:51] <greg5green> could always use the native ecmascript 5 forEach
[02:33:44] <greg5green> Array.prototype.forEach.call($('a'), function(el) { console.log(el.href); });
[02:34:00] <OODavo> Well, yes, that would work.
[02:34:05] <greg5green> or [].forEach.call($('a'), function(el) { console.log(el.href); });
[02:34:17] <OODavo> I'm wondering if it might be more useful and/or consistent to provide a forEach() equivalent to that one as part of jQuery itself.
[02:34:33] <greg5green> bring it up in the dev chan
[02:34:41] <greg5green> or write it yourself and submit a pull request or something :)
[02:34:41] <OODavo> Oh. Which one is that. :P
[02:34:51] <greg5green> i think #jquery-dev but not sure
[02:35:53] <elzi> maybe look into http://jsperf.com/jquery-each-vs-quickeach
[02:36:21] <OODavo> Ah, yep, #jquery-dev is where I should probably be asking this question instead.
[02:37:36] <greg5green> elzi dont think that would work. it sounds like his callback function is expecting "this" as the first param, like you would get with the native forEach method
[02:38:35] <elzi> ahh, right
[02:39:06] <greg5green> for all its blisters, thats one thing dojo has gotten right
[02:39:22] <greg5green> query('a').forEach(function(el) { //do stuff });
[02:40:24] <greg5green> of course, they totally borked the array.forEach and NodeList.forEach methods so that they never can use the native ecmascript 5 versions....
[02:41:00] <OODavo> I ended up just putting .each(function(i,v) {myOriginalFunction(v);}) in my code to work around the weird argument order, but I thought tweaks might be worth considering, hence my asking.
[02:42:42] <greg5green> bleh

[03:58:35] <cruisemaniac> Hello! I'm facing a problem using formvalidator alongside a jquery datepicker plugin. can someone help me troubleshoot this?
[03:59:19] <cruisemaniac> the date picker does not populate the text box until the date is selected. but the validation has happened by then (on blur event) and i need to repeat the date selection process twice before the validation is green on the text
[03:59:24] <cruisemaniac> can this be worked around?

[05:48:20] <FullContactCoder> Anyone have any experience with history.js?
[05:48:51] <FullContactCoder> I have a problem were a mainpage of a blog has a lot of posts and the user will press "load more" at a certain point
[05:49:28] <FullContactCoder> If they then choose to read a post and click the back button they go back to the original state when the page is first loaded
[05:49:46] <FullContactCoder> So they have to click "load more" again to get back where they left of before reading the post.
[05:50:14] <hopkins83> FullContactCoder: Set up a fiddle please.
[05:51:09] <FullContactCoder> I'm just wondering if history.js would tackle this problem. I have not tried to implement it yet.
[05:52:08] <hopkins83> Well, it's an interesting problem. I'd love to play with it in a fiddle.
[05:54:15] <blaster13> how do you go about using another plugin in your plugin

[05:58:40] <hopkins83> Can someone help me patch Selectize.js to work with custom data attributes? I realize it's a lot of code to look through but hopefully it's just a tiny fix: http://jsfiddle.net/YaCPF/

[06:38:37] <hesco> jphase: you told me yesterday:  it'd be much easier if everything had classes on it but this way you get to keep the markup how it is :not(_______).
[06:42:55] <hesco> I control both the markup and the jquery which gets written for it.  I wonder if anyone might show me how that would work, to apply classes to every element, could I replace all that complicated: div:nth-child(' + (index+2) + ')'). with a simple class name and be done with it?  Thinking it might be more extensible that way as the change requests start coming in.  http://jsfiddle.net/#run&togetherjs=uNPPrD8e6K

On the click, that row is then removed and at the bottom a new row is added with the response jquery receives. Now the problem is, those new links aren't included in the handler. I tried adding a handler to the same function in the ajaxcomplete bit, but that way it starts to do things double for old links that were already there. Is it
[07:45:55] <KamiNuvini> possible to somehow "reinitialize" already existing event handlers?

[14:04:27] <Technical_13> Why does that keep crashing my script?
[14:04:32] <Clex> Technical_13: i=i
[14:05:07] <Technical_13> It's suppose to make the script pause for up to 3 seconds unless getAPIresult changes from 0
[14:05:25] <Clex> Your timers will never be called.
[14:05:32] <Technical_13> should I make that var k=i then?
[14:05:33] <Clex> You're mixing up synchrone and asynchrone code.
[14:05:42] <Velveeta> right, those timers go into a deferred execution context until the current context is finished
[14:05:43] <systemfault> You need to learn how to work with async code....
[14:05:49] <systemfault> It really is different.
[14:06:13] <Velveeta> what you should do is process that as a queue, with a timeout to call your process function, and just make it pop the next item off the queue
[14:06:31] <Technical_13> the system I'm working on has an older version of jQuery loaded so I don't have .done or .error or .always
[14:06:44] <Velveeta> you don't need those
[14:07:33] <Technical_13> http://pastebin.com/bDMZ2DEV
[14:08:05] <Technical_13> that's my code... It's returning the I know before the I collected.
[14:08:21] <Technical_13> can someone give me a pastebin that will return it in the right order?
[14:08:41] <Velveeta> i can give you a jsfiddle that will demonstrate how to properly process a queue of items with a timeout
[14:09:28] <Technical_13> of course
[14:12:00] <Technical_13> would adding an async: true, make it work better?  lol J/K
[14:13:34] <Velveeta> here you go: http://jsfiddle.net/Q23PY/
[14:19:17] <Technical_13> Thanks Velveeta as I can twist that around and make it do what I was thinking. :)

[14:24:10] <Clex> Technical_13: +new Date

[14:58:01] <jphase> sounds like you got it figured out?
[14:58:22] <hesco> I made sure all my mark up had classes, that seemed easier than trying to learn all that complex descending relationships you showed me
[14:58:27] <clime1> I have got quite an issue. An iframe I display does not get focus automatically when created (or maybe it gets it and loses it). This happens in Chrome but not in Firefox. I am quite confused why this happens.
[14:58:31] <jphase> yes, much easier
[14:58:36] <jphase> then your code can be like 4 lines
[14:58:37] <jphase> hehe
[14:58:44] <jphase> and the selectors aren't so complex
[14:58:52] <hesco> yes.
[15:00:00] <hesco> I stopped focusing on the front end until my QA folks start complaining and have turned my attention to CI / deployment and building the database model to support the form.
[15:01:00] <hesco> I want to learn some more jquery and am grateful for the opportunity to be exposed to this much from a pro such as yourself.
[15:03:22] <jphase> hehe well thanks for the compliment but there are much more experienced jQuery nerds than I. Happy to help.
[15:34:40] <lemd> whats the or commend for jquery (like &&)
[15:35:26] <lemd> nm google is faster than you
[15:36:48] <dachi_> hey. could you please give me an overview perhaps a link to what is considerably best approach for writing jquery plugins today

[15:41:39] <dachi_> i meant design patterns for plugins
[15:42:03] <dachi_> which one is favored among developers
[15:43:09] <_mtr> Browse plugins on github?
[15:43:49] <dachi_> that was what i was doing while writing but I thought there are .. okay never mind
[15:43:50] <dachi_> thank you

[18:51:24] <Scruffles2> Hey all
[18:52:49] <Scruffles2> Are there any FineUploader users here? I'm having an issue configuring my server.  Page shows up blank instead of with the upload button.
[21:05:39] <waez> hi
[21:11:55] <grafi> ho
[21:34:23] <Scruffles2> hi
[21:44:24] <intermission1> Hi everyone :) I'm having a problem with jquery mobile ui. When a link is clicked, I'm injecting html into the target page. the problem is that after the first time the page is shown, I have to do $(content).trigger('create'); or the widgets aren't loaded.
[21:46:56] <intermission1> I can't understand why it initializes everything the first time, but not after that
[21:49:29] <intermission1> is there a way to check if a specific portion of html has been "created" ? (the widgets are loaded)
[21:55:21] <felixjet_> initself, find()
[21:55:34] <felixjet_> intermission1*
[21:56:33] <intermission1> no i mean if jquery mobile widgets are initialized.
[21:57:29] <intermission1> i don't want to call trigger('create') on elements that have already been created. make sense?
[22:22:28] <floatingpoint> how do I prevent a page from reloading when I do an ajax post?
[22:26:23] <jphase> floatingpoint: sounds like you need to use e.preventDefault() on your form submit handler
[22:35:45] <floatingpoint> jphase where should the e.preventDefault() go
[22:35:51] <floatingpoint> before or after my post?
[22:36:01] <Fusl> floatingpoint: before
[22:36:02] <jphase> floatingpoint: is your post inside of a submit event?
[22:36:12] <jphase> what Fusl said either way ^
[22:37:01] <jphase> and e need to be passed into your submit event, like .submit(function(e){
[22:38:28] <jphase> I think it technically doesn't matter if you put it before or after since the ajax request isn't the thing that actually submits the form, but most people but it before
[22:38:54] <floatingpoint> so I have the action attached to a click event
[22:39:05] <jphase> that's fine too
[22:39:18] <floatingpoint> also, this is nodejs
[22:40:08] <jphase> should still work fine in a .click(function(e){ e.preventDefault(); //ajaxy stuff  fashion
[22:40:43] <floatingpoint> hm
[22:40:52] <floatingpoint> I must have screwed up my route handling
[23:33:34] <blaster13> 				$(window).resize(function () {
[23:33:34] <blaster13> 					alert("baba");
[23:33:34] <blaster13> 				});
[23:33:43] <blaster13> why doesn't this work inside my plugin?
[23:34:02] <blaster13> if I place it in document.ready... it works, but if I place it in my plugin and execute it... it doesnt
[23:41:32] <WG1337> Hi! Can someone give me an idea... I use AJAX to send a form to a PHP file. I need to make a really simple flood protection. I thought to add session in PHP, but I realized that POST comes from server. Any simple ideas how to prevent flood?
[23:49:34] <Technical_13> I don't suppose there is anyone here who can tell me why my callback isn't working right on http://ddowiki.com/page/User:Technical_13/vector.js
