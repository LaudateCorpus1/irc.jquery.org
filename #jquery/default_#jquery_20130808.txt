[00:01:16] <Technodrome> how can I check to see if something was loaded
[00:04:42] <Cork> Technodrome: "something"?
[00:04:58] <Cork> you mean if an ajax call has finished?
[00:05:07] <Cork> or if an image is loaded?
[00:05:09] <Cork> or what?
[00:05:49] <Technodrome> Cork: just trying to see why my script isn't working :)
[00:06:06] <Cork> Technodrome: use the browsers console
[00:06:26] <Technodrome> yeah i've got it up
[00:06:29] <Cork> ctrl+shift+j or ctrl+shift+k depending on the browser
[00:07:05] <Jac0bz1> Good morning (or evning depending on where you are :))
[00:10:19] <BeardedOne_> Watch the greetings Jac0bz1
[00:10:37] <Cork> <_<'
[00:11:05] <Cork> BeardedOne_: something that won't trigger a response doesn't mean "now allowed"...
[00:11:42] <BeardedOne_> ?
[00:12:00] <lemonsparrow> I have  a method in my script file which also has a document.ready which is executed on load.now inside the method when a user clicks on a button, I want the document.ready to run again.. but I dont want the page to reload..
[00:12:43] <Jac0bz1> BeardedOne_: I'm I not allowed to say hello?
[00:13:18] <BeardedOne_> if you want help you need to ask the question
[00:13:20] <BeardedOne_> if you don't you won't see much
[00:13:21] <BeardedOne_> and hello/hi/similar is just spam, and normally doens't mean anything on irc
[00:13:56] <Jac0bz1> It's polite...
[00:14:36] <BeardedOne_> I know right! I just cut and paste what cork said to see if I was crazy for not agreeing with that!
[00:14:53] <BeardedOne_> This Cork guy needs to loosen up :(
[00:15:38] <Cork> BeardedOne_: what i talked about is expecting a response
[00:16:22] <Cork> ppl sitting and working an monitoring a channel for questions, won't drop there work and start typing in a channel just for a greeting
[00:16:34] <Cork> sure you're free to say it, but don't expect a response
[00:17:06] <BeardedOne_> I understand, I'm just having some fun with you Cork
[00:18:15] <Jac0bz1> I did't expect a response, I just said hello.. And to be honest, I do have a question, but I thought I would give it a last try before I made a fool out of my self by asking s stupid question...
[00:18:29] <Cork> ?ask
[00:18:29] <b-ot> Cork: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[00:20:01] <lemonsparrow> this is what I meant http://pastebin.com/qfXrF4Dq
[00:20:14] <lemonsparrow> any way of running document.ready again without page reload
[00:20:58] <Cork> lemonsparrow: function process() {}; $(document).ready(process); process();
[00:21:25] <BeardedOne_> noooo, not that damnable smart questions faq doc! the best support ircs are based on a sense of comradery that that silly document totally goes against. I'll just go though. wouldn't want to spoil your party here.
[00:22:28] <lemonsparrow> Cork: ok
[00:23:18] <lemonsparrow> function process() { $(document).ready(process); }; process();   Cork ryt ?
[00:23:25] <Cork> no
[00:23:36] <Cork> lemonsparrow: function process() {}; $(document).ready(process);
[00:23:42] <Cork> then call process() to call it again
[00:24:21] <lemonsparrow> Cork: ok
[00:25:01] <lemonsparrow> Cork: ok just to understand why {}; after process() isnt it like closing the fucntino ?
[00:25:11] <Cork> yes
[00:25:46] <Cork> lemonsparrow: if you want a function you can call, make it a named function
[00:52:28] <Technodrome> if a javascript function is executed i should see it on this console right?
[00:52:33] <Technodrome> i don't see anything popping up hmmm
[00:55:03] <Cork> Technodrome: why should a function call show in the console?
[00:55:22] <Cork> Technodrome: if you want to know if a function is called, you need to make a debug output from inside the function
[00:55:23] <Technodrome> good question, just trying to introspect this Cork  and see why its not working
[00:55:39] <Cork> alternatively place a breakpoint in the function
[00:57:26] <Assorted> hi!
[00:58:18] <Technodrome> 	$(document).ready(function() {
[00:58:19] <Technodrome> 		console.log("document is now ready");
[00:58:20] <Technodrome> 	});
[00:58:27] <Technodrome> this is not printing out anything to my console Cork
[00:58:46] <Technodrome> this is so embarrassing i do node.js dev and for some stupid reason i can't get the easiest jquery to run
[00:58:52] <Cork> Technodrome: then the script file is most likely not parsed
[00:59:04] <Technodrome> its all inline for this example
[00:59:22] <Cork> oh, wait this is for server side?
[01:00:05] <Technodrome> oh stupid me
[01:00:07] <Technodrome> got it
[01:00:12] <Technodrome> i spelled text/javascript wrong
[01:00:30] <Technodrome> Cork:  no its not, i was just saying it as an example :P ,  like i code in JS all day and i couldn't get that simple thing to work
[01:00:42] <Cork> :)
[01:04:08] <Technodrome> my pjax stuff works now Cork
[01:04:10] <Technodrome> hooray for me
[01:05:42] <Technodrome> that is , if pjax is supposed to work how i think it does hehe
[01:05:44] <Dirkos> Is there a way to register a listener on [rel="tooltip"] on every object?
[01:06:12] <xec> Technodrome: protip, just do <script>, no need for type attribute etc
[01:06:14] <Cork> Dirkos: listner for what?
[01:06:27] <Technodrome> xec: oh
[01:06:27] <Cork> Dirkos: that is a selector, not an event
[01:06:44] <Dirkos> yeah well i want to init the tooltip on everything with rel="tooltip"
[01:06:51] <Dirkos> even when its populated with JS into DOM
[01:07:01] <Cork> $('[rel="tooltip"]').tooltip()
[01:07:18] <Cork> and no you can't make it dynamic
[01:07:35] <Cork> you need to rerun the command on new elements, as they are added
[01:07:48] <lemonsparrow> Cork: it isnt working.. http://pastebin.com/qfXrF4Dq
[01:08:24] <Cork> lemonsparrow: well ya, cause you don't have anything in the process function >_<'
[01:08:41] <Cork> lemonsparrow: move line 25-30 into line 33
[01:09:06] <Cork> lemonsparrow: also it's a function so process() not process
[01:09:52] <xec> Cork: it's passed in to the ready handler, so you don't want to call it, i reckon
[01:10:00] <lemonsparrow> Cork: actually in the list of uisers if user deleted ones.. then I want the entire list of users to reload again which means not 25-30 but only 27-30
[01:10:03] <lemonsparrow> Cork: });
[01:10:09] <lemonsparrow> Cork: http://pastebin.com/qfXrF4Dq
[01:10:11] <Cork> xec: it's a replace for the inline function
[01:10:42] <xec> Cork: exactly..?
[01:10:51] <Cork> lemonsparrow: then you would combine the inline and named function
[01:11:21] <lemonsparrow> Cork: could u show me the change on pastebin pls
[01:11:37] <Cork> xec: line 24-31 was the original solution, but he want to be able to rerun the code
[01:11:56] <Cork> lemonsparrow: do you know how function works in js?!?
[01:12:13] <Cork> just move the code into the function if you want to reuse it
[01:12:27] <Cork> then call the function from where you want the reused code to run
[01:12:47] <lemonsparrow> Cork: http://pastebin.com/qfXrF4Dq
[01:12:52] <Cork> lemonsparrow: the code i gave you was just an example
[01:12:55] <lemonsparrow> Cork: is this what u meant exactly
[01:12:57] <xec> Cork: all i'm saying is, you probably don't want to do $(process()) but $(process)
[01:13:05] <Technodrome> any of you guys ever used pjax?
[01:13:06] <Cork> lemonsparrow: yes, and no, but now you run it twice
[01:13:18] <lemonsparrow> Cork: oops..
[01:13:25] <Cork> xec: line 14 not the one you talk about
[01:13:31] <lemonsparrow> Cork: i want process() to run only once.. after user is deleted
[01:13:46] <xec> ah, i see
[01:13:54] <Cork> lemonsparrow: $(document).ready() calls the function given when the page has loaded
[01:13:55] <lemonsparrow> Cork: shall I remove  $(document).ready(process); from last line ?
[01:14:09] <lemonsparrow> Cork: yep I know
[01:14:21] <Cork> lemonsparrow: yes, and add process() to the other ready
[01:14:29] <Cork> lemonsparrow: and removed the duplicated code
[01:14:55] <nick07> i want to get html5 video into a jqeury slider (fotorama) but i'm unable to get that to work with the slider
[01:15:10] <nick07> the slider only allows lib video's
[01:15:10] <Cork> lemonsparrow: you might want to rename the function to a more descriptive name
[01:15:16] <Assorted> hello!
[01:15:24] <lemonsparrow> Cork: yep but it worked.. thanks
[01:16:35] <lemonsparrow> Cork: <a id="tab2" class="tabby">Users</a> how to change the class to "tab" using jquery ?
[01:17:03] <Cork> lemonsparrow: change tabby or just add the class tab?
[01:18:36] <Cork> $('.tabby').toggleClass('tabby tab') or $('.tabby').removeClass('tabby').addClass('tab')
[01:18:43] <Cork> or just $('.tabby').addClass('tab')
[01:18:45] <doug65536> lemonsparrow: $("#tab2").removeClass("tabby").addClass("tabby")
[01:18:51] <doug65536> beat me to it :)
[01:18:58] <lemonsparrow> doug65536: :)
[01:19:02] <lemonsparrow> Cork: $(".tab1").addClass("tabby") this didnt work
[01:19:04] <doug65536> typo in my addclass
[01:19:10] <lemonsparrow> Cork: $(".tab1").addClass("tab") this didnt work
[01:19:23] <Cork> lemonsparrow: #tab1 not .tab1
[01:19:28] <Cork> it's an id
[01:19:29] <doug65536> lemonsparrow: use # in he selector
[01:20:02] <lemonsparrow> doug65536: oops lol

[01:23:18] <Cork> lemonsparrow: see my response the last time

[01:23:46] <Cork> Assorted: go away
[01:23:48] <Assorted> pay attention next time!
[01:23:55] <Assorted> why?
[01:24:13] <lemonsparrow> Cork:  $('.tabby').addClass('tab') ?
[01:24:14] <Cork> cause you just want to much around, and do that somewhere else
[01:24:21] <Cork> lemonsparrow: the line before that
[01:24:36] <Assorted> lemonsparrow you dumb fuck get a clue!
[01:24:42] <Assorted> stop asking wuestions!
[01:25:50] <Assorted> what wrong, yall got some corks up ya lemonsparrows?

[01:26:20] <Assorted> Cork ! Corkay! Corkeyboy!
[01:26:37] <Assorted> how you holding up there?
[01:27:10] <Assorted> it must be hard corking a lemonsparrow 's butt Cork!
[01:27:15] <Cork> lemonsparrow: then just addClass('tab')
[01:27:33] <Assorted> while munichlinux in munching away at it!
[01:27:47] <Assorted> hnnnngggghhhhh
[01:27:48] <peepsalot> whats a good way to check if an element is inside an anchor element
[01:28:02] <Assorted> ^ thats what it sounds like
[01:28:10] <Assorted> hhhhhhhhnnnngggghhhhh
[01:28:15] <Cork> !ops
[01:28:39] <xec> peepsalot: you could try .closest("a").length
[01:28:50] <Assorted> peepsalot ?! oh shit!
[01:28:59] <EvilNo0B> Hello, can someone help me ?
[01:28:59] <EvilNo0B> How can i make tab slide down right under the menu item clicked? Right now it just slides down the content under all the menu items.
[01:28:59] <EvilNo0B> also i'd like to make it slide up and do not load other content if you click on the same menu item that is already opened.
[01:28:59] <EvilNo0B> Any ideas? http://jsfiddle.net/eqpKY/ ps. i added margin-top 60px on tab container so you could see that it does work but not really the way i want it to work:(
[01:30:09] <peepsalot> Assorted, hmm?
[01:30:19] <Cork> peepsalot: ignore him, just a spammer
[01:30:27] <Assorted> EvilNo0B  peepsalot while  munichlinux is munching away at lemonsparrow 's butt which has been plugged by Cork
[01:30:36] <Assorted> loooooooooool
[01:30:42] <ekcolysp> right click + ignore does wonder!
[01:30:52] <xec> EvilNo0B: looks like you want an accordion instead of tabs?
[01:31:01] <doug65536> lemonsparrow: yes, you can do $('#tab3').attr("class").split(" ").each(function(k,v) { $('#tab3').removeClass(v); });    to remove all classes
[01:31:02] <Assorted> my genius is surpassed only by my ingenuity!
[01:31:10] <xec> EvilNo0B: http://jqueryui.com/accordion/ ?
[01:31:17] <peepsalot> xec, thanks, reading about that led me to .parents which i think is even more appropriate for my use
[01:31:30] <doug65536> lemonsparrow: then add class
[01:31:31] <Assorted> ugh jquery sucks man, write some assembly!
[01:31:37] <Cork> Eviltwin: ping
[01:31:40] <EvilNo0B> xec omg! yes , but something simple
[01:31:46] <Assorted> thats the cross platform shitz!
[01:31:53] <xec> peepsalot: they do basically the same, except .closest() will stop if it matches something, so will be slightly better
[01:31:59] <Assorted> dont you ignore me!
[01:32:06] <Assorted> bow down to me!
[01:32:37] <Assorted> aaaarrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrgggggggggggggggggggggggghhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
[01:32:45] <Assorted> waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh

[01:33:18] <EvilNo0B> xec: the thing is that the php is going to generate lots of links :S
[01:33:26] <xec> EvilNo0B: well, i would probably restructure the html so that the content appears between the buttons, then it should be pretty straight forward
[01:33:39] <Assorted> NEED ATTENTION! ATTENTION == SUSTENANCE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
[01:33:47] <Assorted>  NEED ATTENTION! ATTENTION == SUSTENANCE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

[02:07:03] <zedboy> I'm trying to understand some code which has a <ul> with a bunch of <li>'s inside, and dynamically repopulates the content with document.createElement, then $("#idOfUL")[0].appendChild(newLI); ... why is the [0] there?
[02:07:16] <testerdude_>  dammit zedboy
[02:07:19] <testerdude_> stfu
[02:07:30] <leknoppix> hello all, I'm french so excuse me for my english
[02:07:33] <testerdude_> you dumbass
[02:07:40] <jnewt> how do i get the column widths of a table into an array?
[02:07:48] <testerdude_> i ant excusin shit leknoppix !
[02:07:55] <Cork> zedboy: we're under spam attack right now, so might be worth comming back later
[02:07:57] <xec> zedboy: the [0] returns the native DOM element, allowing you to use the native methods instead of jquery
[02:08:01] <aaronmcadam> zedboy: jQuery returns an object with many properties. the first property contains a reference to the DOM object
[02:08:17] <testerdude_> jnewt  shove the table up your ass and shit it out
[02:08:19] <zedboy> xec, aaronmcadam: thanks!
[02:08:32] <xec> zedboy: most likely you could rewrite that code as $("#idOfUL").append(newLI);
[02:08:35] <zedboy> Cork: eh, s/n still isn't bad :)
[02:08:51] <testerdude_> fuck you cork, this aint spam
[02:09:00] <jnewt> testerdude_, come out from behind that computer and i'll shove my boot up your ass.
[02:09:08] <aaronmcadam> and testerdude_ I'd like to kick the fuck out of you
[02:09:15] <jayne> why all this violence?
[02:09:20] <testerdude_> the funny thing is im a reasonably big guy!
[02:09:22] <jayne> testerdude_: what is your goal here?
[02:09:32] <zedboy> So a followup question: Now, if I want to select that LI, should $("#idOfUL > li") work? (it's not for me ;-P )
[02:09:40] <testerdude_> no dwayne johnson, but i can bench a bit!
[02:09:59] <xec> zedboy: you already have a reference to it in the "newLI" var, don't you?
[02:10:09] <testerdude_> goal? GOAL?! GGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL
[02:10:29] <aaronmcadam> why is this guy not banned yet?
[02:10:30] <zedboy> xec, yes, but it's taking on new CSS attributes when it gets put into the document, and I need to set its style "in the real world" (after the insert)
[02:10:38] <testerdude_> fuck you
[02:10:50] <testerdude_> you cant ban me!
[02:10:57] <enigma> that's probably coming real soon
[02:10:58] <testerdude_> i am everywhere
[02:11:04] <testerdude_> i am everything
[02:11:21] <testerdude_> proxies and vpns are my bitches
[02:11:22] <Cork> jnewt: don't encourage him
[02:11:30] <testerdude_> please do!
[02:12:08] <leknoppix> I have a problem about a jquery's plugin, i'm using this plugin: http://grafikart.github.io/Zoombox/ and, i have a error "$.browser is undefined" but i think that it has the latest version of jquery
[02:12:08] <jnewt> Cork: sorry, i'm done.
[02:12:19] <enigma> jnewt: seems like he's done too :)
[02:12:27] <enigma> the spammer, that is.
[02:12:45] <Cork> ah
[02:12:47] <ghadzookster> yeah right bitch!
[02:12:52] <ghadzookster> haaaaaaaaaaaaa
[02:13:00] <aaronmcadam> leknoppix: yeah $.browser was removed in 1.9
[02:13:07] <ghadzookster> omg im laughinh so hard
[02:13:18] <ghadzookster> im gonna choke here
[02:13:22] <aaronmcadam> the plugin is depending on that method leknoppix
[02:13:22] <ghadzookster> karma
[02:13:43] <ghadzookster> stfu aaronmcadam
[02:13:56] <ghadzookster> leknoppix go eat a dick!
[02:13:56] <aaronmcadam> you really have problems don't you
[02:14:03] <ghadzookster> you too cork1
[02:14:03] <leknoppix> no, i don't think, it was only for ie6
[02:14:04] <zedboy> leknoppix: there is a plugin you can get that fixes that
[02:14:08] <aaronmcadam> were you an altarboy or something
[02:14:15] <xec> zedboy: you're talking about the rules from a css file getting applied?
[02:14:25] <zedboy> xec: yeah.
[02:14:40] <aaronmcadam> leknoppix: google "jquery 1.9 migration plugin"
[02:14:43] <ghadzookster> aaronmcadam the only one of you bitches with a sense of humor!
[02:14:53] <ghadzookster> the rest of ya mooks!
[02:14:57] <fuse_> jquery .browser
[02:14:59] <ghadzookster> bitches!
[02:15:10] <ghadzookster> the lot of ya!
[02:15:15] <aaronmcadam> bitches is a bit light though, you suck
[02:15:24] <aaronmcadam> sounds like you're not even trying
[02:15:26] <ghadzookster> awwwwwwww shhhit
[02:15:50] <xec> zedboy: if newLI is a DOM element, you could just do newLi.style.whatevercssproperty = "whatever value"; or $(newLI).css({property: "value",...});
[02:15:52] <ghadzookster> its 5 am and i havent slept. im nt on y game
[02:15:58] <ghadzookster> my
[02:16:17] <jnewt> http://jsfiddle.net/PzSYM/556/ that's how i'm creating my table body.  i don't know where to get the widths though, maybe i need to create each td as a jquery object somehow?
[02:16:38] <zedboy> xec: will that work even after I insert newLI as a child of the UL?
[02:16:48] <xec> yes
[02:16:49] * zedboy goes to console.log that and see what happens
[02:16:58] <Altreus> hallo. How can I determine whether element A is before or after element B in the DOM? I need to choose between nextUntil and prevUntil
[02:17:00] <zedboy> xec, rockin, shoulda tried that
[02:17:10] <ObiWlanKenobi> * i
[02:17:13] <xec> zedboy: but you can do it before too, same results
[02:17:41] <zedboy> xec: I'm setting the style of that LI, and yet after insert it's still coming back with the default style
[02:17:42] <Cork> Altreus: you could check index()
[02:18:02] <Altreus> a.parent().index(a)?
[02:18:10] <Cork> a.index()
[02:18:11] <xec> zedboy: can you reproduce that behaviour in jsfiddle.net ?
[02:18:13] <Altreus> oh heh
[02:18:21] <Altreus> that might work - let me check
[02:18:37] <zedboy> xec: ugh, it's in the middle of 1500 lines of gobbledygook I inherited :)
[02:18:42] <Phiil> Cork: spot the next instance of this noob :p
[02:19:07] <xec> zedboy: yeah but you could fiddle around with some dummy code
[02:19:16] <Cork> Phiil: ya...
[02:19:26] <Altreus> gotta love obj[ COND ? 'x' : 'y' ](params)
[02:19:32] <Altreus> I call it job security
[02:19:37] <zedboy> xec: will play with it, it's not a setup that may be so terribly easy to recreate on a pinhead
[02:19:37] <Phiil> loool
[02:19:46] <Phiil> love that Altreus
[02:20:47] <Cork> ^
[02:21:57] <xec> zedboy: http://jsfiddle.net/gL48f/
[02:22:53] <Cork> ah, it was quiet not bad :)
[02:23:00] <Cork> *ban
[02:23:01] <zedboy> xec: sweet. There must be code I'm missing (or *something* I'm missing) that's hitting my style after I touch it.
[02:23:28] <zedboy> xec: console.log(newLi) does show the object with the correct style, but in the document it's coming up with wrong style
[02:24:09] <xec> zedboy: sounds like something else going on then, yeah.
[02:24:42] <zedboy> xec: unlesss...the css looks like this: #idOfUL li { background: <wrong stuff>; }
[02:24:55] <zedboy> xec: Am I hitting the css in the wrong place, because it really lives at the UL level?
[02:25:00] <ObiWlanKenobi> http://jsfiddle.net/jXDtK/ how can i connect jcrop to this: http://jsfiddle.net/jXDtK/ ?????
[02:25:11] <xec> no, styles set on the element directly wil override any css file
[02:25:24] <xec> (assuming there are no !important declarations)
[02:25:57] <zedboy> xec: So this is pretty wacky :-) but again, I'm untangling a lot of code I didn't write, so it's possible I'm missing something (obviously looked for the relevant css tags & didn't find them in the code)
[02:26:13] <Altreus> It works :D
[02:26:18] <Altreus> thanks Cork
[02:26:25] <Cork> np
[02:26:37] <xec> zedboy: of course, if you have a background on the UL, removing it from the LI isn't going to do anything
[02:28:15] <lemonsparrow> Cork: the code uses jquery.tablesorter.js and now after delete when I click on sort option the cached data would still show the deleted user.. any way I can handle this ?
[02:28:31] <lemonsparrow> Cork: does jquery table sorter give some api to handle this ?
[02:28:46] <zedboy> xec: No, the background is set on the li
[02:29:00] <Cork> lemonsparrow: you would have to check the plugins documentation
[02:29:35] <ObiWlanKenobi> http://jsfiddle.net/jXDtK/ how can i connect jcrop to this: http://jsfiddle.net/jXDtK/ ?????
[02:29:58] <lemonsparrow> Cork: will this help ?

[02:35:03] <Guest39746> ui.offset - absolute position of the helper as { top, left } object, relative to page
[02:35:12] <Guest39746> how do i get RIGHT and BOTTOM values?
[02:35:23] <Cork> left + width
[02:35:28] <Cork> and top + height
[02:35:29] <lemonsparrow> Cork: http://pastebin.com/UpXuv9Ku I do something like this but now my table is not displayed at all
[02:35:57] <Cork> Guest39746: the browsers coordinate system uses top left
[02:36:12] <Cork> so if you want to get the other you need to calculate it your self
[02:36:14] <Guest39746> hmm
[02:36:24] <Guest39746> :brr
[02:37:10] <InDigital> Cork ok and relative to parent DIV?
[02:37:24] <InDigital> :D
[02:37:25] <Cork> there is nothing like that
[02:37:33] <InDigital> oh
[02:37:35] <Cork> you can get relative to the offset parent
[02:37:46] <Cork> give the parent you want as relative as position: relative;
[02:37:49] <Cork> and it should just work
[02:38:02] <InDigital> Cork ok great, big thanks
[02:38:08] <Cork> np
[02:38:30] <xec> i guess you could get the position of both the element and its parent and then do the math
[02:38:45] <Cork> ya, that is an option
[02:39:44] <Cork> lemonsparrow: not sure what table sorts does there so, i can only guess
[02:39:51] <InDigital> yes, a little difficult workaround :)
[02:40:04] <Cork> InDigital: not really
[02:40:23] <Cork> target.position().top - parent.position().top
[02:40:57] <InDigital> ok i will try these.. bye

[02:50:12] <Cork> it's your choice
[02:50:20] <Cork> what you do is what depends on what happens
[02:50:41] <Cork> uh rather what happens depends on what you do
[02:51:00] <gandul> whats wrong in this code ? http://pastie.org/8218074#3
[02:51:19] <Cork> gandul: $(this).(".content")
[02:51:28] <Cork> should be $(this).find(".content")
[02:51:29] <hyonm_> Or i can just keep switching client/connection pairs! I have 8 clients and 4 connections ... and im ont the 9th combination :D

[03:00:27] <guyhawks_> And I'm out! bye!
[03:06:54] <lemonsparrow> any idea guys https://gist.github.com/mithunsasidharan/6183397 regarding why I am getting this error for tablesorter.js
[03:07:49] <phiz> lemonsparrow: it can't find $(#table-users) ?
[03:08:02] <seutje> lemonsparrow: does that selector match an element when it's being evaluated?
[03:08:25] <seutje> stick a console.log(usersTable.length) in there or set a breakpoint and check it
[03:09:11] <lemonsparrow> phiz: seutje I am just following this solution http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1903788/updating-jquery-tablesorter-plugin-after-removing-a-row-from-dom#answer-2013571#answer-2013571 to update cache after row is deleted
[03:09:38] <lemonsparrow> var usersTable = $("#table-users"); does return to me the table phiz seutje
[03:11:19] <phiz> lemonsparrow: and usersTable.get(0).config.sortList ?
[03:11:27] <seutje> lemonsparrow: well, the DOM element being returned doesn't seem to have a config property
[03:12:21] <seutje> lemonsparrow: is this config property maybe added by the tablesorter plugin and it has not yet been initiated?
[03:12:31] <lemonsparrow> seutje: phiz usersTable.get(0).config.sortList  returns []
[03:12:49] <phiz> that would point to what seutje is saying
[03:13:00] <lemonsparrow> phiz: so what's the solution ?
[03:13:11] <seutje> lemonsparrow: what? at the time this code is being executed, or are you just throwing this in the console?
[03:13:37] <Cork> phiz: no if config was missing it would error out
[03:13:56] <phiz> hmm good point
[03:14:17] <lemonsparrow> seutje: I am running it in console.. does that make any difference
[03:14:37] <phiz> so sortList isn't getting defined
[03:14:47] <Cork> it is defined
[03:14:50] <lemonsparrow> seutje: tried in code too and after deleting the row I still had the cache of that on sorting
[03:14:53] <Cork> the response is an empty list
[03:15:11] <lemonsparrow> phiz: if it wasnt defined it would throw undefined I am getting []
[03:15:41] <seutje> the error occurs when it gets passed to updateHeaderSortCount
[03:15:54] <seutje> at that point it's undefined, and undefined doesn't have a length
[03:15:55] <lemonsparrow> this is a similar issue http://forum.jquery.com/topic/dynamically-updating-tablesorter-two-problems
[03:16:31] <lemonsparrow> seutje: but that is global and is included in my js file
[03:17:09] <lemonsparrow> seutje: now I get usersTable.get(0).config.sortList  [  [  1  ,   0  ]  ]
[03:17:15] <phiz> you don't have to do something like: var defaultSort =[[4,1]];   $("#table-users").tablesorter({sortList:defaultSort});
[03:17:18] <phiz> ?
[03:17:29] <lemonsparrow> seutje: phiz Cork right after page refresh
[03:18:36] <phiz> lemonsparrow: is it getting set after the js is already ran?
[03:19:07] <seutje> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4460107/jquery-tablesorter-error seems to suggest racing conditions when triggering update and sorton at the same time
[03:19:33] <lemonsparrow> phiz: yes
[03:20:05] <phiz> well then...
[03:20:36] <lemonsparrow> phiz: seutje shall I hardcode the sortList ?
[03:20:50] <phiz> the architecture is up to you, but at least you know the problem now
[03:21:47] <lemonsparrow> phiz: I need the solution
[03:22:12] <phiz> well you know it is not set when it needs to be, so set it before it is required to be there is the solution.
[03:23:58] <phiz> either the element doesn't exist when your global js is looking for it or you are having some sort of scope issue with your "global"
[03:24:11] <chankey> Is there any way to prevent user from entering 0 as first digit in input box? I mean allow user to enter 40, 400 but stop him from adding 04, 004?
[03:24:16] <chankey> http://jsfiddle.net/gBFqZ/8/
[03:24:16] <phiz> i am not good enough at js to troubleshoot that blind, sorry
[03:24:54] <lemonsparrow> phiz: sometimes its set automatically and sometimes not
[03:25:00] <lemonsparrow> phiz: now its giving usersTable.get(0).config.sortList  []
[03:27:09] <phiz> lemonsparrow: sounds like you have some debugging to do
[03:30:04] <phiz> chankey: hmm 0 is keycode 48 so not sure why your code isn't workign
[03:30:39] <chankey> yes. Actually I want to allow 0, but not as a first digit.
[03:32:46] <lemonsparrow> phiz: hmm with this https://gist.github.com/mithunsasidharan/6183397 seutje
[03:33:00] <phiz> chankey: it doesn't look like it is getting to the part of the code that is doing that logic btw
[03:34:45] <phiz> chankey: oh...change it to <= 48
[03:35:00] <steveccc> i am using .toggle to hide and display an element. Is it possible to use .toggle with addClass so that I can add and remove a class from the element at the same time?
[03:35:24] <phiz> chankey: if ((event.keyCode !==9) && (event.keyCode <= 48 || event.keyCode > 57 )) {
[03:36:37] <phiz> lemonsparrow: i was looking at http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6650002/jquery-tablesorter-access-internal-config-parameter
[03:36:51] <phiz> lemonsparrow: see how they set sortList
[03:41:33] <lemonsparrow> phiz: thanks leme try
[03:49:30] <lemonsparrow> phiz: its loading all the data twice and the deleted one is coming up once
[03:50:00] <lemonsparrow> phiz: is it because I am reloading the data all again using ajax once the user clicks on delete button and then doing this sorter stuff ?
[03:52:41] <phiz> lemonsparrow: perhaps
[03:53:43] <lemonsparrow> phiz: but shouldnt I reload the data after deleting  ?
[03:54:43] <phiz> lemonsparrow: sounds like you have some investigating to do.  wish i could help you more but i need to tap out.  sorry.
[03:54:57] <lemonsparrow> phiz: wait help me out for some more time :)

[04:05:30] <lemonsparrow> how to remove the <tr> completely for which the go button was clicked https://gist.github.com/mithunsasidharan/6183724 considering the ids and class names are common ? Cork
[04:05:43] <greengriminal> Sounds daft and a bit dumb but trying to do a simple ajax call to some json. I want to get the last 20 commits and then add the avatyars to my content div
[04:05:45] <greengriminal> http://jsfiddle.net/5scaZ/1/
[04:05:56] <Cork> anli: if you want to have your name in the url as far as i know; aka. no real reason
[04:06:07] <lemonsparrow> basically I want that <tr> to be removed whose go button was clicked
[04:06:28] <Cork> greengriminal: you can't make json calls cross domains
[04:07:00] <Cork> lemonsparrow: $(this).closest('tr').remove()
[04:07:26] <greengriminal> Cork: What does this mean?
[04:07:30] <anli> Ah, thats how the name came there
[04:08:09] <anli> Cork: But maybe you also get a list of fiddles previously issued
[04:08:15] <anli> history
[04:08:51] <Cork> greengriminal: domain x can't make a json call to domain y
[04:09:11] <greengriminal> Cork: Heres another example that works - http://jsfiddle.net/eygbU/1/
[04:09:15] <Cork> anli: don't think so, but might be wrong
[04:09:43] <Cork> greengriminal: ah.. so github allows it, interesting
[04:10:00] <tra> greengriminal: jsonp or make a local proxy that fetches your stuff from the another domain
[04:10:22] <greengriminal> tra: you can see in my seocond example I am using just json
[04:10:29] <greengriminal> but in my inital example this was not working for me
[04:12:08] <Cork> greengriminal: author doesn't have a member name, i guess you want login
[04:12:59] <greengriminal> Cork: Cool beans
[04:13:36] <greengriminal> Cork: If i wanted to get the last 20 commits I understand that would involve me doing some sort of for loop then
[04:15:02] <lemonsparrow> Cork: this will work  $(this).closest('tr').remove() but once user clicks on go button there is another alert which asks do u want to continue deleting and then I run the code of removing the row.. so this. whouldnt work in that context.. any alternative ?
[04:17:15] <greengriminal> This is me being cheeky and I am still learning but If i want to get the last 20 commits for a user could I do something like: http://jsfiddle.net/Jcc7E/1/ I know this doesn't work. But it was feable attempt
[04:21:10] <lemonsparrow> Cork: also it is returnin Object[]
[04:21:35] <lemonsparrow> Cork: this is html https://gist.github.com/mithunsasidharan/6183724  $(this).closest('tr');.
[04:22:15] <tra> greengriminal: http://jsfiddle.net/fGUjZ/
[04:24:27] <greengriminal> tra: I so the $.each is a iterator that allows you to iterate over objects and array
[04:24:57] <tra> greengriminal: yes, you could do it with for aswell, but i prefer $.each if you have jquery in use anyways
[04:26:37] <Cork> lemonsparrow: not sure if you missed what i mean, on the click even from the button do $(this).closest('tr').remove()
[04:26:42] <tra> greengriminal: your solution would have made over twenty ajax calls, which was unnecessary
[04:27:56] <lemonsparrow> Cork: thanks
[04:29:28] <lemonsparrow> Cork: can I pass that as an argument to a function ? var a = $(this).closest('tr'); and then do a.close();
[04:29:37] <lemonsparrow> a.remove()
[04:29:53] <Cork> yes
[04:32:03] <opc0de> yop
[04:32:10] <lemonsparrow> Cork: thanks
[04:33:59] <titii> Who can share to me some URL nice tooltip of the anchor title plugin? ty
[04:44:08] <_pingu> is there a nice alternative for good scroll behaviour? I already know anchors and jquery.scrollIntoVIew.
[04:44:40] <Cork> ?g jquery.scrollTo
[04:44:41] <b-ot> Cork: Ariel Flesler: jQuery.ScrollTo → http://flesler.blogspot.com/2007/10/jqueryscrollto.html
[04:51:15] <_pingu> Cork: ok, thanks. I can't seee license informations
[04:59:36] <_pingu> ok, found it.
[05:00:29] <gandul> Cork: thank you
[05:10:51] <Neillithan> I'm trying to get some jquery to work on my site and it doesn't appear to be working.  The JS and CSS files are in the head, but the JS isn't actually running on my site..  can somebody help me diagnose this problem?
[05:14:42] <Cork> Neillithan: link?
[05:15:02] <Neillithan> Cork: http://logichaos.com/logichaos2/general/90-djhdbvv.html
[05:15:37] <Neillithan> Cork: this is what it's supposed to show http://zinoui.com/demos/accordion#default-1
[05:17:43] <Cork> Neillithan: warning <!-- -- -- --> is only allowed in html5 documents
[05:17:55] <Neillithan> whu...
[05:18:01] <Cork> cause -- is actually what starts and stops the comment
[05:18:17] <Cork> <> marks a tag and -- starts it and the second -- stops it
[05:18:28] <Neillithan> Cork: so which comment is causing the error?
[05:18:38] <Cork> no the page is littered with errors...
[05:18:47] <Neillithan> ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh crap
[05:18:50] <Cork> thats just one of them
[05:18:59] <Neillithan> herp
[05:19:07] <Cork> "[14:16:13.684] Password fields present on an insecure (http://) page. This is a security risk that allows user login credentials to be stolen." <-- is another bad part
[05:19:09] <Neillithan> I guess I'll have to hunt them all down and fix them lol
[05:19:12] <Neillithan> but that doesn't make sense
[05:19:33] <Neillithan> cork: I don't think that's actually the culprit here.
[05:19:41] <Cork> and you set a base to a full url to an html file
[05:19:45] <Cork> and thats also wrong
[05:20:05] <Cork> Neillithan: no but the page has so many errors it's hard to find where to start
[05:20:10] <Neillithan> i see
[05:20:23] <Cork> Neillithan: start by updating the doctype to <!doctype html>
[05:20:34] <Cork> and then run it through w3c and fix all the errors it finds
[05:20:49] <Cork> then try again and see if it works
[05:20:55] <Neillithan> okay
[05:24:22] <Neillithan> Cork: regarding the full url... I believe that was set by either my template or my CMS
[05:30:53] <greengriminal> I have the following fiddle, its gets the last 20 commits and tehn adds the avatars of the of the commits. However I want to make is so that the more commits they have made the bigger their avatar should be. http://jsfiddle.net/fGUjZ/4/
[05:31:42] <greengriminal> At the moment you can see that at the moment if someone has committed more than once their avatar appears more than once, however I want it to do the opposite and appear once but much larger based on the amount of times they've commited.
[05:32:13] <greengriminal> so like 1 commit would be 50px x 50px, 2 commits would be 60px x 60px
[05:32:38] <sammich> when you loop through, you'd count how many times each time author occurrs
[05:32:50] <sammich> at the end of that loop, then you'd draw up your HTML
[05:33:19] <greengriminal> so could you do something like author.count
[05:38:58] <greengriminal> sammich: I believe I could do for each id get the number of commits for the projects
[05:39:12] <sammich> hold up, fixing up something for you
[05:42:53] <fuchstronaut> I have a a form with many input fields, dropdowns, etc... If values changed I want to send them to the server, is it ok to have one big object and send it via ajax, or should i, because of performance, just post the changed values to the server?
[05:47:30] <sammich> greengriminal: http://jsfiddle.net/fGUjZ/7/
[05:47:42] <sammich> have a look at that, I need to afk for a few minutes
[05:48:01] <watchu> hey guys,
[05:49:34] <RRR2> hi
[05:49:51] <sammich> actually, greengriminal http://jsfiddle.net/fGUjZ/9/
[05:50:21] <watchu> i have a strange problem:
[05:50:21] <watchu> when i do a post like this:
[05:50:21] <watchu> postJSON: function(url, data) {
[05:50:21] <watchu> 	  $.ajax({
[05:50:22] <watchu> 		method: 'POST',
[05:50:22] <watchu> 		url: url,
[05:50:23] <watchu> 		type: 'application/json',
[05:50:23] <watchu> 		dataType: 'json',
[05:50:24] <watchu> 		data: data
[05:50:24] <watchu> 	  });
[05:50:25] <watchu> i can perform a valid post request on my server, but with the problem, that the media type is not supported.
[05:50:46] <watchu> so i try to set teh content type in the header like this:
[05:50:46] <watchu> contentType: 'application/json',
[05:51:22] <watchu> and then it says i would try to perform an "OPTION"-Request
[05:51:38] <watchu> instead of a "POST"-Request
[05:51:56] <watchu> can anybody help me with this problem?
[05:53:54] <gandul> i am using $($(this).find("a")).addClass("open"); however its targetting all the a inside, with html being like this ul li a, how can i target the first a of it only
[05:54:43] <fuchstronaut> $(this).children('a')
[05:55:11] <RRR2> Yes
[05:55:11] <sammich> $(this).find('a:first')
[05:55:34] <fuchstronaut> oh, i guess i missunderstood the question, sammich is right
[05:55:46] <RRR2> There might be something fishy going on there
[05:56:09] <sammich> $($($($($($($(this)))))))
[05:56:15] <sammich> jQuery-ception
[05:56:17] <RRR2> watchu: First, are you using a different domain to post than the domain the JavaScript is executed?
[05:56:19] <FernandoBasso> I have this small piece of code: https://gist.github.com/FernandoBasso/5736966 Somehow, the ajax request never even gets sent.
[05:56:20] <sammich> jCeption
[05:56:39] * sammich wonders if that's a name of a plugin
[05:57:16] <RRR2> Please never use $($(whatever)
[05:57:23] <sammich> )
[05:57:38] <RRR2> )
[05:57:44] <RRR2> dam
[05:57:53] <RRR2> Now there's too many closing parenthesis
[05:58:07] <sammich> lets play a game of pong
[05:58:11] <sammich> |      .
[05:58:18] <RRR2> And no way to close them!
[05:58:18] <watchu> RRR2: yes, the javascript is executed on my local machine and the post adresses to a small server running a tomcat and a mongodb
[05:59:33] <RRR2> RRR2: And you seem to be using Firefox, don't you?
[05:59:33] <RRR2> OOPS
[05:59:42] <watchu> no chromium
[05:59:56] <sammich> mirror: mirror
[06:00:08] <RRR2> I tagged myself
[06:00:08] <RRR2> I'm sleepy
[06:00:16] <watchu> no problem
[06:00:23] <watchu> i tried chromium and firefox
[06:00:26] <watchu> both the same
[06:00:51] <RRR2> Ah, are you using chromium, well chromium usually doesn't send OPTIONS requests...
[06:00:57] <RRR2> MAybe it does now.
[06:01:12] <gandul> a:first isnt working
[06:01:13] <RRR2> Well, the problem happens when you are using 2 different domains.
[06:01:14] <watchu> i can send you the response if you want to see it
[06:01:40] <watchu> can this be shortcircuted?
[06:02:10] <FernandoBasso> No one? Is that code at least correct?
[06:02:57] <RRR2> watchu: No, the browser 'must' send a request to know if the server 'allows' to XHR them from another website
[06:03:11] <RRR2> This is what happens when you use two different domains
[06:03:28] <RRR2> What you can do is have the script on the same domain
[06:04:17] <RRR2> Or blame broswer developers and get a unsecure browser if exists, in case it doesn't you have to make it.
[06:04:34] <RRR2> but it will only work for you.
[06:05:03] <RRR2> Yeah, everyone hates XHR restrictions, why can't the world be free?
[06:06:19] <sammich> cuz then you'll be screwed 10 ways from sunday from XSS attacks
[06:06:26] <RRR2> sammich:           .|
[06:06:44] <sammich> world's slowest game of pong. ever.
[06:07:18] <RRR2> I loled
[06:09:26] <kinder> http://pastebin.com/ZQRRu1Jt the alert at line 11. do not work. I think it is because am using a click event on a element that has been created with jquery append. Solution?
[06:10:17] <RRR2> Yes
[06:10:33] <RRR2> You have to append it first then .click it.
[06:10:45] <gandul> $($(this).parent.find(".content")) html is li > a li > content, function is on click on li > a, how can i target the content of its parent li
[06:10:51] <kinder> Wait, what? I thought I was doing that already
[06:12:33] <sammich> kinder: it looks like you are, but not really
[06:12:38] <RRR2> kinder: You're not http://pastebin.com/359BvcCD (this will be a very bad idea)
[06:12:40] <kinder> It does indeed
[06:12:50] <sammich> you're adding that div after you click
[06:13:00] <sammich> that click binder happens on load, when that class isn't there
[06:13:05] <sammich> because you obviously haven't clicked
[06:13:21] <RRR2> If you have more than 1 .removeParticipant don't use the code above
[06:13:30] <kinder> I will have plenty of them
[06:13:36] <sammich> it's not wrong
[06:13:51] <sammich> it's only wrong if you have elements dynamically added in after the fact
[06:13:59] <sammich> use .on()
[06:14:29] <RRR2> you have to select the tags though...
[06:14:50] <sammich> $('#any-parent-selector').on('click', '.removeParticipant', handler);
[06:15:18] <gandul> li a, how will i target the parent of a
[06:15:23] <sammich> that might be a bit ambiguous, but I'm trying not to use 'body'
[06:15:34] <sammich> a.parent()
[06:16:11] <RRR2> sammich: does that add the event handler to any .removeParticipant that will be added to the DOM?
[06:16:26] <sammich> yes, but not directly
[06:16:42] <sammich> .on() delegates
[06:16:43] <gandul> $($(this).parent.find(".content")) but then this isnt working
[06:16:50] <sammich> you'll have to read up on it
[06:17:10] <sammich> gandul: stop putting a selector in a selector
[06:17:33] <sammich> well, that's not a strictly correct point
[06:17:39] <sammich> you don't need that outer $()
[06:18:25] <gandul> sammich, the structure is li > a, and li > .content. i want to click on a, which will target its corresponsing .content
[06:20:27] <RRR2> sammich: Oh, that is amazing! So the real event is attached to the parent tag (body or a div) and then checks the element target and all its parents to see if it matches the criteria? and executes upon that?
[06:20:55] <RRR2> Why, I didn't thought of that
[06:21:56] <RRR2> I'm think*
[06:22:05] <RRR2> I'm failing again..
[06:22:22] <sammich> pretty much
[06:22:41] <sammich> you can't reliably do dynamic content without delegation
[06:24:32] <RRR2> what I used to do, was to add the event listeners to the element when they were added
[06:25:02] <RRR2> to each element, I'm probably never going to do that again..
[06:25:43] <sammich> oh boy yeah
[06:26:00] <sammich> when I was starting out doing jQuery a bit under a year ago
[06:26:12] <sammich> that was all I did.
[06:26:56] <RRR2> I understand now how to make an element draggable and undraggable
[06:27:40] <RRR2> (I kinda used complex remove and add eventslisteners back then)
[06:27:41] <sammich> $(element).draggable()
[06:27:46] <sammich> not hard, eh? ;)
[06:28:25] <RRR2> It's kinda lengthy.
[06:28:29] <mad_mode_on> for an anchor, why   event.preventDefault();   is better than   return false;  ??
[06:28:31] <RRR2> when debugging something..
[06:28:55] <sammich> and you can only bind one event
[06:29:01] <RRR2> event.preventDefault() works when you use addEventListener instead of on+'event'
[06:29:05] <sammich> per event type
[06:29:48] <gandul> sammich: what do you mean by selector inside a selection, how else will i target it
[06:29:59] <gandul> selector inside a selector
[06:30:29] <RRR2> It's already jQuerified you don't need to jQuerify it
[06:30:30] <sammich> you were doing $($(selection).find(...)), you don't need that outer $( )
[06:31:06] <RRR2> is like you didn't read $.fn.init
[06:32:59] <mad_mode_on> for an anchor, why   event.preventDefault();   is better than   return false;  ??
[06:33:11] <RRR2> jQuery should throw errors when putting jQuery objects as arguments
[06:33:52] <RRR2> mad_mode_on: because return false; won't work when you use event listeners
[06:34:07] <sammich> it's not wrong though, to pass in jQuery objects into $()
[06:34:09] <sammich> it's just...wrong
[06:34:41] <FernandoBasso> Okay. I am requesting a file in the same server, but the error suggests that I am trying to get the file from another domain, which is not the case.
[06:35:40] <FernandoBasso> Firefox just tells me nothing, opera throws the error, but it works with chrome...
[06:36:15] <RRR2> if(a.constructor==jQuery){throw new Error("You are doin it WROONG")}
[06:36:33] <t0tht_-> hi
[06:36:46] <t0tht_-> can i return the data on success of ajax ?
[06:37:16] <RRR2> No, you could use open(,,false) but that would pause your script
[06:37:23] <sammich> can I complain about something? is being proficient at keyboard shortcuts a rare skill, or something?
[06:37:58] <RRR2> sammich: I have no idea.
[06:38:21] <sammich> one guy at work is horrible. Mouse this, mouse that.
[06:38:43] <sammich> so I thought, he's just an outlier. So new guy starts. Nearly the same thing.
[06:38:47] <RRR2> totht_- What you should do is to make your data executes on a onloadend event, pass that as a callback, that should work
[06:38:54] <sammich> switching apps? No worries, I'll just move my mouse there
[06:39:03] <RRR2> sammich
[06:39:18] <sammich> switch back? okay, I'll move mouse to the original app
[06:39:23] <RRR2> lol
[06:39:34] <RRR2> It kinda works when you're a designer
[06:39:48] <RRR2> But when you're a dev, is disgraceful.
[06:39:50] <sammich> how about a programmer...
[06:40:15] <sammich> honestly, he's typing with one hand on his mouse half the time
[06:40:32] <RRR2> but why
[06:41:46] <RRR2> FernandoBasso: post script/error
[06:42:00] <seutje> shouldn't be using a mouse :P
[06:42:24] <sammich> well
[06:42:36] <seutje> then again, this recent trend against providing the power-user with enough freedom is troubling
[06:42:40] <sammich> if you're stuck with using several different flavours of IDEs all based on Eclipse
[06:42:55] <sammich> you have no bloody choice
[06:43:15] <seutje> remove all the shortcut keys!
[06:43:59] <RRR2> NO
[06:44:12] <RRR2> so how do I copy paste now
[06:46:19] <sammich> I remove the copy and paste options on my contextual menu in notepad++
[06:47:44] <FernandoBasso> RRR2: The problem is when the url field in the browser does not have www, then, the request is made _from_ 'domain.com', but the file I am trying to access is interpreted as 'www.domain.com', even though I jus do $.post( 'relative/path/to/file' ...
[06:48:13] <RRR2> That's weird
[06:48:40] <kinder> I tried that .on() thing sammich with no luck. I think my code is far off in hell man's land http://pastebin.com/5UKhQgg3
[06:49:08] <RRR2> it must be relative? Event though it's a 'bad' solution, why don't you try absolute paths?
[06:50:57] <blib1> does anyone have any pointers for logging out a user that is using basic auth?
[06:51:16] <FernandoBasso> RRR2: I my case it doesn't matter.
[06:51:30] <RRR2> kinder: you did it wrong again. you should try that with the parent of the removeElement (one that holds all of them, it can be body, but it shouldn't)
[06:51:50] <RRR2> Unless it's body.
[06:51:56] <FernandoBasso> Even if I use http://www.domain.com/path/to/file and the user did not type 'www' in the url, the browser is assuming xss.
[06:52:30] <RRR2> is your server redirecting the request to the www.domain ?
[06:52:47] <FernandoBasso> Not that I am aware of.
[06:53:40] <RRR2> blib1: By 'basic' authentication, you mean HTTP authentication
[06:54:23] <kinder> RRR2: I want each click to be specific and personal :) Wouldn't placing it on the container cause one giant click area?
[06:55:01] <FernandoBasso> So, I am doin't like this: var localDomain = window.location.hostname; $.get( url + '/path/to/file' )
[06:55:05] <blib1> RRR2: yes
[06:55:25] <FernandoBasso> I mean, $.get( localDomain + '/path/to/file' )
[06:55:48] <RRR2> blib1: The one that doesn't use cookies?
[06:56:26] <blib1> RRR2: yes
[06:56:51] <RRR2> FernandoBasso: console.log localDomain
[06:57:02] <RRR2> does it have the www.
[06:57:16] <RRR2> blib1: Oh boy.
[06:57:57] <FernandoBasso> Yes when it is on the url, and no when it is not. I just have to prepend http:// in the beginning.
[06:58:55] <sammich> kinder: care to do some reading? http://api.jquery.com/on/
[07:00:23] <RRR2> blib1: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/449788/http-authentication-logout-via-php
[07:00:30] <RRR2> AKA YOU CAN'T
[07:00:47] <blib1> k :(
[07:01:10] <watchu> RRR2: now everything runs on localhost, the js from port 8080, the tomcat on 8383, same problem :(
[07:01:35] <kinder> sammich: dont flame me but I ahve indeed read that and I don't learn a lot by reading. Am a practical man who like examples.
[07:01:50] <kinder> but ill look closer on these examples
[07:02:03] <gonnarule> hi all
[07:02:34] <RRR2> watchu: Must match domain AND ports, why? Don't ask me.
[07:02:53] <gonnarule> anyone know why jquery.validate.js would set a "novalidate" attribute in a form I want to validate ?
[07:03:57] <watchu> ok
[07:04:13] <gonnarule> Even more, I've 2 forms in my page, one generated by struts (<html:form>) and the other one is a normal html form. html form get validated, when struts form is generated with a novalidate attribute. Don't know why ?
[07:04:36] <watchu> RRR2: but thanks for your answers, at least i know what the problem is
[07:08:17] <kinder> ok sammich I managed to do it now. One issue has appeared though. The alert is being triggered for each appended element.
[07:08:47] <kinder> http://pastebin.com/bMGqY3ND
[07:09:46] <sammich> yeah, that's pretty much the idea
[07:10:36] <kinder> sammich: my idea is that when clicked I append an element. When I click on that element it should be removed.
[07:10:47] <kinder> the appended element
[07:11:57] <sammich> so your remove handler should remove itself
[07:12:33] <kinder> pretty much yeah
[07:13:38] <sammich> so, in your $().on('click', '.removeParticipant', function() { $(this).remove() });
[07:18:59] <RRR2> OH man, they blocked me on the network for using bittorrent
[07:19:02] <RRR2> I forgot to close it down
[07:19:04] <RRR2> had to change MAC
[07:19:21] <sammich> shhh
[07:19:26] <RRR2> what?
[07:19:27] <sammich> freenode doesn't like such talk
[07:19:34] <RRR2> Aww
[07:23:07] <md4d> hey there. just released my first version of pjaxr - its a multicontainer pjax replacement lib. check this out: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6179050
[07:24:08] <RRR2> That's nice
[07:24:36] <md4d> RRR2: thanks! :)
[07:24:47] <md4d> got to go =/ hope to get some feedback!
[07:29:13] <arkore> hello.  i have a json string returned from api call.  i use jquery parseJSON and i get object variable from it.  but when i try to access any key from the object variable, i get undefined?  why?  even when i try to dump my json object var, i get nothing.
[07:29:46] <arkore> the json string (this is returned from my api call) appears to be correct format. it is: {"city": "BEVERLY HILLS", "state": "CA", "country": "US"}
[07:31:13] <RRR2> what do you try
[07:31:32] <thaifood> hi
[07:32:00] <thaifood> Anyone know of a dialog like gritter that can also do Yes/No Confirm type stuff ?   http://boedesign.com/blog/2009/07/11/growl-for-jquery-gritter/
[07:32:05] <grafi> show some code arkore
[07:32:15] <thaifood> I like how you don't have to create any divs for it
[07:32:59] <RRR2_> Stop disconnecting!
[07:33:55] <kinder> am appending text to a textarea with jquery, can I add a linebreak in jquery sonehow?
[07:33:57] <kinder> somehow
[07:34:28] <grafi> "\n" should work?
[07:34:30] <grafi> i think
[07:35:08] <RRR2_> kinder: lmao, this is not even a jQuery issue
[07:35:18] <kinder> it could be RRR2_ if we try real hard.
[07:35:30] <kinder> I like it here
[07:35:34] <RRR2_> if it's html use <br> obviously
[07:35:45] <grafi> its not though is it?
[07:35:51] <RRR2> use \n
[07:35:54] <grafi> kinder http://jsfiddle.net/vmdtm/
[07:36:10] <RRR2> or \r\n or \n\r or \r
[07:36:16] <grafi> sure
[07:38:03] <kinder> RRR2_ there is no way <br> would work in a textarea
[07:38:07] <kinder>  \n however did work
[07:38:39] <RRR2> wait wut
[07:38:56] <RRR2> How come New Line character didn't work
[07:39:01] <kinder> I said wut wut in the code
[07:39:11] <RRR2> show code
[07:39:14] <kinder> code works
[07:40:58] <iredmedia> Testing
[07:42:14] <RRR2> iredmedia: did you created a IRC client?
[07:42:53] <iredmedia> HAHA, noooo :P sorry. I was just testing to see why i couldn't write anything in lime
[07:43:09] <iredmedia> Would you've been jealous if i said yes
[07:43:31] <RRR2> No
[07:44:28] <RRR2> But I would admire you in a way
[07:44:28] <arkore> grafi, http://jsfiddle.net/kAGds/ (not working), but http://jsfiddle.net/kAGds/1/ (is working)  why?
[07:45:11] <ingodid> is there a way to unload all jquery-ui select inputs?
[07:45:34] <RRR2> ingolid, to remove them from the DOM or to hide them
[07:45:49] <ingodid> remove from DOM, unbind, etc ...
[07:46:04] <RRR2> Yes
[07:46:33] <ingodid> something like $.ui.selects.unload() ?
[07:47:03] <RRR2> I actually don't know, lemme google it
[07:47:06] <arkore> grafi or anyone?
[07:47:36] <RRR2> I do know the JavaScript way though
[07:47:38] <NoiseEee> ingodid: .remove()
[07:47:39] <ingodid> maybe it's destroy(), but that function would have to do clean up
[07:48:10] <DarkGhost`> http://privatepaste.com/bc56013855
[07:48:17] <iredmedia> RRR2: HAHA Thanks.
[07:48:23] <iredmedia> Heres my issue for today.
[07:48:40] <DarkGhost`> Why doesn't this change the .html properly? it toggles .extracosts good but doesn't change the toggle to Show Extra cost
[07:50:08] <t0tht_-> hi
[07:50:23] <grafi> arkore do you expect the first example to work on jsfiddle? or on you site? because naturally the request fails on the fiddle
[07:50:26] <t0tht_-> how i can manipulate the close button inside the input in jquery mobile?
[07:51:02] <RRR2> arkore: because you can't simply use XHR requests in jsFiffle
[07:51:09] <RRR2> jsfiddle*
[07:51:37] <iredmedia> RRR2: isn't it possible? just annoyingly difficult?
[07:51:39] <ingodid> NoiseEee: the .remove() method exists within the jquery object?  would i need to grab a handle for each on creation, or is there a method to retrieve all ui widgets?
[07:51:52] <arkore> grafi, well, i'm just overriding the request (in this test case) by hard-setting response equal to the JSON string that normally I would receive from the API.  problem is, the object is empty when i try to use it later on
[07:51:54] <grafi> arkore: also theres the "problem" that ajax is async, so the data test() accesses is not neccessarily there yet when you try to access it
[07:52:05] <NoiseEee> ingodid: $('.everythingWithThisClass').remove();   //removes everything as well as all data- and event info on each
[07:52:06] <grafi> arkore not in the first example though
[07:52:37] <RRR2> iredmedia: What thing isn't impossible
[07:52:53] <ingodid> NoiseEee: here's to hoping that the UI is smart, and cleans up on remove()
[07:52:53] <rfk> Anyone have experience with the jQuery data API? I have: console.log(val); $(e).data('k', val); console.log( $(e).data('k') );  // First, Object( {} ) is logged, then null.
[07:53:15] <iredmedia> RRR2: XHR in JSF
[07:53:17] <arkore> is it because im out of scope when i set addressFinder.result to something from within the find function of addressFinder itself?
[07:53:52] <RRR2> iredmedia: alright, it is possible to insane levels, and everyone can XSS attack you.
[07:53:53] <grafi> you make a $.get, which fails, your success (the function that would actually set the result) is never called
[07:54:08] <iredmedia> LOL Yes. Just making sure
[07:55:14] <RRR2> NoiseEee: when you removeChild an element, aren't the events removed too? Or they're kept (when the element isn't stored in a variable)
[07:55:30] <NoiseEee> RRR2: remove() removes the events, yes
[07:56:12] <RRR2> Nevermind, I guess it all depends on the browser from that point.
[07:59:53] <arkore> grafi, ok i see my problem now, http://jsfiddle.net/T38Vu/1/  (it's being called now),  but i see my problem now; my test() is executing before the $.get finishes.
[08:00:06] <arkore> bah
[08:00:15] <grafi> arkore look into $.when and deffereds
[08:00:19] <grafi> that'll help you
[08:00:25] <arkore> ok thx
[08:03:29] <DarsVaeda> can I select all elements that have placeholder attributes?
[08:04:16] <BillCriswell> DarsVaeda: $('[placeholder]') should do it.
[08:04:32] <grafi> ugh
[08:04:39] <grafi> thats the worst
[08:04:41] <grafi> :P
[08:04:54] <BillCriswell> It does feel pretty dirty.
[08:05:38] <grafi> BillCriswell http://cdpn.io/yebIw
[08:06:00] <grafi> ive spent way too much time pressing buttons on my keyboard ._.
[08:06:15] <BillCriswell> Haha.
[08:06:19] <BillCriswell> Good use of HSL
[08:06:30] <grafi> yeah hsl is pretty awesome
[08:06:45] <BillCriswell> Wonder how far back IE supports that
[08:07:00] <grafi> hm i think i tried ie10 after creating it
[08:07:03] <grafi> doesnt work
[08:07:04] <grafi> xD
[08:07:04] <BillCriswell> 9+
[08:07:23] <BillCriswell> Ohhh
[08:07:57] <grafi> although it could be that ie10 just doesnt like codepen
[08:08:02] <grafi> im getting weird errors
[08:08:08] <BillCriswell> Oh, does look like 9+
[08:09:03] <grafi> yeah
[08:09:07] <Saaether> no need to smash your keyboard, just hold down 1 key. same effect without all the smashing =D
[08:09:12] <grafi> so pretty much all you ever want to support ;)
[08:09:27] <iredmedia> I'm a giraffe.
[08:09:27] <BillCriswell> What fun is having a keyboard if I can't smash it.
[08:10:02] <grafi> congrats iredmedia

[08:10:38] <grafi> oô
[08:11:36] <al1o> a stupid question, but I couldn't answer it properly by myself: What is best to store the state of elements in a website?
[08:11:38] <iredmedia> :D Now i am a bananna. Speaking of banannas, does anyone know how to create an element, without using $() ie, this.$element.append('<div>'), then IMMEDIATELY select that element? I nkow of many hackish wayss, like adding a class in the create string, and simply doing $('div').appendTo(this.element), but thats not what i want :(
[08:11:47] <al1o> In JS variables or better as a class in the element?
[08:11:56] <al1o> for example: A filter which can be active or not active
[08:12:04] <al1o> either with a variable: var filter_a
[08:12:15] <al1o> or the element <a href="#" id="filter_a" class="active">
[08:12:43] <iredmedia> al1o: Depends on your implmnt.
[08:12:56] <Jabberwock> Hi all. This is regarding JQM. I have the following code: http://pastie.org/8218856 which works - until I go to an ajax-link in which as soon as the new page loads it transitions right back to the #android-page
[08:13:03] <Jabberwock> Does anyone know of a workaround?
[08:13:05] <iredmedia> al1o: Most times, if you have a LOT of stuff going on, you'll use classes/objects. Otherwise, the DOM is a fine place to put your information.
[08:13:37] <al1o> iredmedia: thanks
[08:13:38] <emx> i always use $( document ).ready() to call functions that access elements in the DOM. now i saw an example where $( window ).load() is used.
[08:13:42] <emx> is there a difference?
[08:13:48] <iredmedia> No worries.
[08:14:14] <iredmedia> emx: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3698200/window-onload-vs-document-ready
[08:14:22] <al1o> iredmedia: is there anything which would keep them in sync when states are stored in variables / objects?
[08:14:47] <iredmedia> Well... you don't really need to have identical data in two places
[08:14:55] <al1o> iredmedia: or is it up to me to implement / maintain sync?
[08:14:57] <iredmedia> You simply store them in your DOM, then when you require them, you pull them out.
[08:15:08] <emx> iredmedia, thanks
[08:15:47] <iredmedia> Yes, there are systems which grab/set data for the dom. If you're into jquery, use the .data(property, value) method LOTS
[08:15:51] <iredmedia> emx: *
[08:16:25] <al1o> yes, I started using jquery a few weeks ago
[08:17:08] <emx> iredmedia, i don't get your last message.
[08:17:10] <al1o> coming from the embedded world I'm always preocupied about speed
[08:17:59] <al1o> how does jquery select the elements? Does it scan from the beginning to the end of the DOM or does it use some kind of lookup table for direct access?
[08:18:39] <iredmedia> Okay. So the BEST way to store data in the dom, is behind the scenes. DOM elements information is 90% behind the scenes. What you SEE is only 10% of the information, which the browser pulls out and renders. There is DATA, which are property value pairs (aka just plain old information) that you can access using .data. Google "jquery .data" it'll give you simple examples
[08:18:43] <emx> al1o, depends on the selector. elements with id-attributes set are found very quickly.
[08:19:15] <duch_kazatel> al1o this article should help: http://blog.bigbinary.com/2010/02/15/how-jquery-selects-elements-using-sizzle.html
[08:19:26] <iredmedia> al1o: Often times, you look for a 'parent' or context (which is my MVVM, MVC, etc are desirable) then do a lookup. 99% of the time, doing ONE lookup through a large page takes less then 2ms
[08:19:49] <duch_kazatel> long story short: native javascript does some of the heavy lifting, and they do optimizations on top of that for their own nefarious purposes.
[08:20:24] <iredmedia> So unless you're doing repetitive operations, thousands of operations (huge data grids, massive image pages, etc) then you likely will be fine with sizzle (jqgrids selector engine)
[08:20:38] <iredmedia> al1o:  exactly. Duch got it.
[08:21:07] <duch_kazatel> if you're ever worried about performance with jquery, don't be.  leverage it.
[08:21:25] <duch_kazatel> let it do the hard work - it's often far more performant than anything else you can do on your own.
[08:21:28] <duch_kazatel> though not always.
[08:21:47] <computer2000> how do you test websites xdevice, like on android phones, windows phones? for ios I am using the iphone simulator, is there any emulator for android and or windows mobile?
[08:22:05] <al1o> ok thanks duch, emx and iredmedia
[08:22:11] <iredmedia> al1o: np!
[08:24:38] <MelkorNemesis> hey guys
[08:24:44] <ingodid> ugh -- it wasn't jquery, it was something called chosen...fixed, and thank you
[08:25:14] <iredmedia> al1o: and duch_kazatel is right. Lol. They have THOUSANDS of users picking apart their code every day. (Not including all the users that use and test it every day). You can still use jquery to alleviate jquerys fallback. Say you have a massive page. A dating site, porn site, etc. You can have a page level javascript object, that holds references to the largest parts as objects. You now have stored references which you can use jquery to scan
[08:25:14] <iredmedia> through to find your object. it's basically the same logic as a binary search :P
[08:25:46] <al1o> Let me describe you shortly my scenario: I'm implementing a realtime listing with about 15 filter possibilities. There are approx 50 new data sets every minute which I add to the list with jquery. I was doing long polling before, letting the server (django) do the filtering. Now I want to switched to Websockets and Push. But I need to to the filtering on the client side, since the server has no idea about the filter setting
[08:25:46] <al1o> s of the individual clients
[08:26:10] <DarsVaeda_kicked> is there an opposite of focus()?
[08:26:11] <al1o> it's more or less like: www.dxfor.me
[08:26:13] <Bloomberg> Morning guys!!
[08:26:36] <Bloomberg> someone has worked with this plugin --  http://jquery.aamirafridi.com/jst/#examples?
[08:26:55] <MelkorNemesis> I'm using datepicker from jquery-ui. First the datepicker disappeared only when I choosed any date. But I wanted datepicker to disappear when I click anywhere out of datepicker. So I found this "$(".hasDatepicker").blur(function(e) { $(this).datepicker("hide"); });" .. but it also disappears when I'm trying to click next/prev month since the blur event on the input is triggered, any idea how to solve this?
[08:28:10] <BillCriswell> DarsVaeda: .blur()
[08:28:19] <DarsVaeda> yeah no
[08:28:24] <DarsVaeda> .focusout()
[08:28:29] <ingodid> computer2000 : yes, android sdk has an emulator
[08:28:31] <BillCriswell> Uh, ok.
[08:29:22] <DarsVaeda> but it is missing in the forms events docu bit misleading
[08:30:02] <gonnarule> Anyone would know where I can find the list of rules which can be applied in jquery.validate ? Can't find it, google is not my friend on this one =/
[08:31:54] <gonnarule> oh well, just found it, finally :)
[08:32:43] <BillCriswell> The difference on blur and focusout is weird. They both seem to bubble for me.
[08:33:16] <BillCriswell> Oh I read it wrong.
[08:35:03] <BillCriswell> Never needed focusout. Good to know.
[08:35:43] <DarsVaeda> needed it to copy placeholder behavior
[08:36:02] <BillCriswell> DarsVaeda: blur() would have worked as well in your case.
[08:36:54] <DarsVaeda> blur sounds more like an optical effect
[08:37:03] <BillCriswell> Well.. not on dynamically created elements.
[08:37:26] <DarsVaeda> oh okay blur is a name for an event
[08:38:12] <BillCriswell> DarsVaeda: https://github.com/ginader/HTML5-placeholder-polyfill/blob/master/src/placeholder_polyfill.jquery.js might be of use.
[08:38:45] <DarsVaeda> 210 lines of code O_o
[08:38:56] <BillCriswell> https://github.com/mathiasbynens/jquery-placeholder slighly shorter
[08:39:42] <DarsVaeda> I stick with my non advanced 9 lines ^^
[08:39:48] <duch_kazatel> what does he need?
[08:40:01] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: Placeholder polyfill.
[08:40:22] <duch_kazatel> aaaaah
[08:40:26] <duch_kazatel> joy
[08:40:33] <MelkorNemesis> I've been using http://jamesallardice.github.io/Placeholders.js/ :)
[08:41:18] <DarsVaeda> http://jsfiddle.net/6rxdZ/
[08:41:31] <arkore> you'll never find a good placeholder script for IE support.  i tried all the polyfill-methods out there.  they all don't work.  you'll need to use value="" and onfocus value = ''; onblur value = old_value;
[08:42:04] <RRR2> Is there a placefolder specifically for IE
[08:42:15] <RRR2> maybe using things like VBScript!
[08:42:20] <RRR2> i'm joking
[08:42:22] <arkore> well, that's what the polyfill stuff is for, supposed to fix for IE.  but doesn't
[08:43:00] <RRR2> Why it doesn't
[08:43:05] <RRR2> Why support IE
[08:43:22] <arkore> because half the world purchased computers with windows on it, and they never upgrade because they're newbs.
[08:43:35] <DarsVaeda> or are not allowed to
[08:43:39] <grafi> good thing we all die eventually
[08:43:52] <arkore> i hate IT people that restrict people from upgrading.  newb IT.
[08:44:00] <duch_kazatel> wat
[08:44:00] <RRR2> There are portable browsers
[08:44:19] <RRR2> IT people that restrict not using IE?
[08:44:32] <BillCriswell> DarsVaeda: This will run on browsers that support placeholder, and it wouldn't work with textareas, lots of little gotchas.
[08:44:54] <RRR2> they're probably from microsoft
[08:45:01] <DarsVaeda> BillCriswell, that is the "non advanced" part
[08:45:12] <grafi> that it doesnt work?
[08:45:12] <grafi> ^^
[08:45:15] <arkore> restrict upgrades.  they strip out everything; dumbing the machine down for the people that use it.  hell, they even strip out the "Help" menu option in IE menu bar.
[08:45:23] <grafi> why would you feel the need to polyfill palceholders anyway?
[08:45:49] <arkore> polyfill is a hack to simulate placeholder functionality for older IE browsers.
[08:45:56] <RRR2> I just use a portable browser
[08:46:00] <DarsVaeda> what does polyfill mean anyhow?
[08:46:14] <RRR2> but I hate chrome in a way too
[08:46:23] <tw2113> i wouldn't call it a hack
[08:46:28] <BillCriswell> Chrome is a saint.
[08:46:35] <RRR2> and I'm starting to hate firefox for it's non-support
[08:46:36] <BillCriswell> Google Chrome is a saint!
[08:46:38] <tw2113> more a bit of js to set input values dynamically on focus/blur
[08:46:42] <RRR2> Botnet
[08:47:00] <RRR2> use chromium
[08:47:33] * tw2113 uses firefox and doesn't care what anyone else says
[08:47:51] <grafi> tw2113 ++
[08:48:02] <RRR2> Firefox doesn't support <input type='number'>
[08:48:13] <tw2113> not yet
[08:48:33] <RRR2> They were supposed to add it on Firefox 4
[08:48:35] <BillCriswell> Thanks for the ugly ass spinners, HTML5.
[08:48:41] <Bloomberg> Guys how can I get the evnt of selected tab with jquery tabs
[08:49:01] <Bloomberg> foor example, when one tab is selected only that show my alert event
[08:49:10] <RRR2> firefox 25 still doesn't support it
[08:49:43] <tw2113> what of it? they haven't added support for it yet
[08:49:54] <RRR2> and they never will
[08:50:08] <tw2113> have you heard that from them?
[08:50:10] <tw2113> or just assume?
[08:50:48] <duch_kazatel> https://wiki.mozilla.org/User%3aMounir.lamouri/HTML5_Forms
[08:52:23] <RRR2> Assuming, Okay so tell me tw2113 a reasonable date where firefox will support it.
[08:52:27] <duch_kazatel> more specifically: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=344616
[08:52:54] <RRR2> Perhaps 1 or 3 years?
[08:53:08] <arkore> apparently there is a new browser called "RockMelt" that Yahoo just purchased.  http://arstechnica.com/business/2013/08/yahoo-acquires-rockmelt-2010s-hottest-browser-for-60m-to-70m/
[08:53:29] <arkore> 70million for a browser?  heh
[08:53:31] <tw2113> dunno, i'm not that deep into their coding teams
[08:53:41] <tw2113> but saying they'll never do it is not the right thing to do either
[08:54:09] <BillCriswell> What people spend money on blows my mind.
[08:54:13] <Bloomberg> someone here that want to help?

[08:54:40] <arkore> why aren't you chilling in codeigniter, Bloomberg
[08:54:48] <arkore> why you only join when you need help.  :(
[08:54:58] <Bloomberg> oh my god
[08:55:02] <Bloomberg> Whe you say that?
[08:55:07] <Bloomberg> is wron
[08:55:09] <Bloomberg> wrong*
[08:55:10] <RRR2> I really disliked RockMelt, I didn't even installed it but it's ads were annoying
[08:55:31] <Bloomberg> how are you arkore?
[08:55:32] <arkore> j/k Bloomberg, I seen you chilling in there before.
[08:55:37] <arkore> i'm good, thanks for asking
[08:56:47] <Bloomberg> have you worked with jquery tabs before?
[08:57:01] <arkore> RRR2, yah, why ads always being shoved in our faces, in everything.  it's like listening to radio in your car, everytime you find a new radio station (that's good), eventually it starts to suck because they start filling it with ads and now you hear more ads than music.  not to mention, they bring on some annoying host bitch that yaps and yaps, and talks to hurtin' people(that call in, because
[08:57:01] <arkore> they have no friends and no one else to talk to)
[08:57:39] <grafi> lol
[08:57:55] <arkore> Bloomberg, there are plenty of tabs scripts out there.  or "content sliders" or "steps wizards"
[08:58:22] <Bloomberg> how can I to select the tab that is active, neither more show me an event, only which is actived
[08:58:43] <RRR2> the best solution is to have a playlist
[08:58:51] <Bloomberg> I need get the click event in the (checked, selected, actived) tab
[08:58:56] <RRR2> and if you want to know new songs, internet
[08:59:13] <duch_kazatel> Bloomberg - do you have a working example up on JSFiddle?
[08:59:21] <duch_kazatel> or on a site somewhere?
[08:59:47] <Bloomberg> you understand what i need?
[09:00:06] <duch_kazatel> i have no clue since i can't see any code?
[09:00:25] <duch_kazatel> you're asking us to shoot in the dark - without seeing what you've got, we have no way of knowing how to toss over as assist.
[09:00:49] <arkore> Bloomberg, well, some scripts have that functionality built in.  otherwise, you could do it manually yourself.  just give your tab an ID, like <div id="tab1">  and do javascript $('#tab1').click(function(e) { alert('i have been clicked!'); });
[09:01:27] <duch_kazatel> or do what armore said.
[09:01:33] <arkore> my name is arkore
[09:01:44] <duch_kazatel> errk, arkore sorry.
[09:01:55] <grafi> xD
[09:01:56] <duch_kazatel> typing too fast.
[09:01:57] <arkore> ;)
[09:02:06] <grafi> ar <Tab>

[09:02:46] <duch_kazatel> which is why I just hand-typed and missed a character
[09:02:47] <grafi> oô
[09:03:52] <arkore> grafi, are you one of the authors of jquery, or a contributor of some kind? or you just a person that knows it well.
[09:04:11] <grafi> not even a person that knows it well probably ^^
[09:04:36] <RRR2> 8 matches for “ar”: [Arieh_, arich, arielserafini, arkore, aro, arpin_, arpu, arschmitz]
[09:04:43] <RRR2> arokore plz

[09:06:42] <Bloomberg> http://jsbin.com/ijupum/1/edit
[09:06:47] <Bloomberg> Something like this
[09:07:53] <deanrock0> hi, is it possible to find out if an object has specific method?
[09:08:07] <Bloomberg> arkore: has  been my script?
[09:08:14] <Bloomberg> I need to do something like that
[09:08:15] <deanrock0> i want to get rid of the following error: Uncaught TypeError: Object #pairs-pics li.allowed has no method 'html'
[09:08:47] <arkore> Bloomberg, tell us what you've tried so far.  what have you researched so far.
[09:09:02] <BillCriswell> deanrock0: typeof foo.bar === "function"
[09:09:07] <BillCriswell> I think is what you want?
[09:09:17] <rymonator> or js's hasOwnProperty
[09:09:33] <BillCriswell> It just seems like you're trying to use jQuery's .html() on something that' not a jQuery object.
[09:10:22] <Bloomberg> arkore: I cannot do it like you told me because the ide of my tabs is dynamic, so i need to find the way of do it with some property like "activated", or some like this
[09:10:26] <grafi> Bloomberg you know that .tabs() fires events for certain things right? like activating tabs and such?
[09:10:40] <deanrock0> does $(div).each (function() {...}); somethingElse(); executes synchronously  (first it goes through the loop and then calls somethingElse()) or asynchronously?
[09:10:49] <grafi> http://api.jqueryui.com/tabs/#event-activate Bloomberg
[09:10:53] <arkore> Bloomberg, you should make a test-case in jsfiddle.net and post the URL here, with your question
[09:11:27] <arkore> Bloomberg, you can setup jsfiddle.net to load your ide tabs script.
[09:11:48] <t0tht_-> hi
[09:11:49] <t0tht_-> http://pastebin.com/pP6QLsyS
[09:11:58] <t0tht_-> whi is not work my basic auth?
[09:13:01] <t0tht_-> any can help me?
[09:16:12] <t0tht_-> :(
[09:19:26] <zizzl> Hey guys has anyone ran into something where there's a  div id="exposeMask" placed before </body> and it places a div over the entire page and on a click it dissapears.. it's not visible at all but it takes away from the user's first click
[09:19:34] <zizzl> not sure what plugin it's from but just wondering if anyone has seen this..
[09:19:37] <t0tht_-> any?
[09:20:21] <deanrock0> in which case would $(this).html() fail?
[09:20:55] <BillCriswell> deanrock0: If it's an empty element I imagine it woudl be empty? But just failing I can't think of a reason.
[09:21:00] <BillCriswell> deanrock0: What is this?
[09:21:24] <deanrock0> in my case i use it in $(div).each() { $(this).html();}
[09:21:27] <zizzl> actually it's display:block and on a click it goes to display:none
[09:21:31] <zizzl> any ideas?
[09:21:36] <BillCriswell> deanrock0: You need to quote div.
[09:21:45] <BillCriswell> $('div')
[09:21:50] <deanrock0> div variable holds the name of element
[09:22:00] <BillCriswell> what is div?
[09:22:17] <deanrock0> li - element of list
[09:22:34] <grafi> div is li? now you lost me
[09:22:53] <BillCriswell> deanrock0: So you have div = 'li' ?
[09:23:01] <deanrock0> div = '#links li'
[09:24:38] <BillCriswell> deanrock0: http://jsbin.com/itatac/1/edit works just fine here.
[09:24:47] <BillCriswell> There's something else you're not making us aware of.
[09:24:56] <benedikt> is it not possible to handle http errors with $.post() or $.get() ?
[09:24:56] <deanrock0>  i have http://pastebin.com/pSr2DNHJ and sometimes $(this).html() fails because of:  Object #links li has no method 'html'
[09:25:25] <grafi> o.o
[09:26:14] <BillCriswell> deanrock0: Do you want the contents of a list in an array?
[09:26:58] <Bloomberg> arkore: neither of the events in the web page of tabs jquery works for me.
[09:27:07] <deanrock0> BillCriswell: i want to execute some code for every li in the list
[09:27:16] <grafi> b
[09:27:26] <BillCriswell> deanrock0: Then why the g1 = $(div).each ?
[09:27:27] <Bloomberg> I need one event that alert when is selected
[09:27:45] <deanrock0> BillCriswell: div = '#links li'
[09:27:49] <grafi> http://jsbin.com/ijupum/3 Bloomberg ?
[09:27:51] <BillCriswell> Going to lunch.
[09:28:21] <grafi> enjoy your meal BillCriswell
[09:28:21] <Bloomberg> I need the opposite to that
[09:28:28] <Bloomberg> The disabled tab alert
[09:28:34] <grafi> erm
[09:28:40] <t0tht_-> http://pastebin.com/pP6QLsyS
[09:28:52] <grafi> you just said you need an events thats alerts when selected
[09:28:53] <grafi> ...
[09:29:17] <Bloomberg> yes, but the selected tab
[09:29:36] <grafi> i dont understand
[09:29:39] <t0tht_-> the prompt to input user and pass
[09:30:10] <Bloomberg> In the link that you sent me, alert the tab that you are currently
[09:30:37] <Bloomberg> Only allow you alert the tab that you are currently, neither more
[09:30:42] <Bloomberg> understand me?
[09:30:45] <grafi> Nope
[09:30:49] <grafi> Not at all
[09:30:59] <duch_kazatel> Bloomberg you mean alert the currently selected tab?
[09:31:04] <Bloomberg> yes
[09:31:05] <duch_kazatel> only on pageload?
[09:31:16] <duch_kazatel> what do you want in the alert?
[09:31:34] <Bloomberg> Add content to that tab
[09:31:40] <Bloomberg> For example a form
[09:31:49] <duch_kazatel> what info do you want in the alert?
[09:32:09] <Bloomberg> For example a form for add a new record to a table
[09:32:15] <grafi> So I click a tab, and then you catch that and do some stuff?
[09:32:15] <duch_kazatel> ....
[09:32:31] <grafi> how is that not the activate/beforeActivate event?
[09:32:41] <duch_kazatel> sup language barrier.
[09:33:03] <Bloomberg> no because those events works for another tabs, not the current
[09:33:44] <duch_kazatel> so you only want to know on pageload, never when a user then clicks another tab?
[09:33:46] <duch_kazatel> !xy
[09:33:51] <grafi> I dont fucking get it ... if i click a tab the current tab will change, so changes to the "previous" tab are not visible anymore?
[09:33:52] <nhulea> yo!
[09:34:08] <nhulea> hows everyone  doing
[09:34:09] <duch_kazatel> Bloomberg what are you really trying to accomplish?
[09:34:17] <Bloomberg> For example there are four tabs, the (one.two,three,four). if you are in the two tab and you're going to select the three tab, doesn't happen nothing, but if you select you current tab ("two") show you a form with new data
[09:34:34] <duch_kazatel> so if I click again on the same tab?!
[09:34:38] <duch_kazatel> wtf why would you do that?
[09:34:57] <Bloomberg> yes the same tab
[09:35:09] <duch_kazatel> you're going to confuse the hell out of your end-users.
[09:35:20] <Bloomberg> why?
[09:35:22] <grafi> hell you're confusing the hell out of me :p
[09:35:25] <Bloomberg> is so hard?
[09:35:51] <duch_kazatel> it's a really easy thing to implement, but your end-users will never thing to click the same tab to do that.
[09:35:55] <duch_kazatel> makes absolutely no sense.
[09:36:03] <duch_kazatel> i'm guessing you're letting them edit the contents of that tab?
[09:37:01] <Bloomberg> how you will do it?
[09:37:18] <duch_kazatel> Bloomberg am I right?
[09:37:51] <arkore> Bloomberg, please better explain the scenario.  Tell us your story, from the beginning.
[09:39:02] <Bloomberg> http://jsbin.com/ijupum/1/edit
[09:39:19] <duch_kazatel> Bloomberg - you have no explained why you want it to act that wya.
[09:39:21] <duch_kazatel> *way
[09:39:28] <Bloomberg> Is simple, if you are in the tab "proin dolor" and select agai tab tab alert
[09:39:56] <duch_kazatel> Bloomberg correct - what are you going to do with that info?  why do you need it to do that?
[09:40:09] <Bloomberg> ho my god°!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
[09:40:13] <Bloomberg> oh*
[09:40:26] <Bloomberg> If for to add new info to that tab
[09:40:35] <grafi> http://jsbin.com/ijupum/5/ Bloomberg
[09:40:37] <duch_kazatel> that's the wrong way to do that, then.  make an edit link for that.
[09:40:38] <arkore> lol
[09:40:41] <imjakechapman> let's try a question…… Angular JS vs Ember JS ready…… go! :)
[09:40:58] <duch_kazatel> what he wants to do is going to be confusing as hell to end users.
[09:40:58] <awc737> LOL
[09:40:59] <awc737> wow
[09:41:10] <awc737> ember
[09:41:20] <Bloomberg> I have many tabs and that is the easy way for do it
[09:41:24] <Saaether> i liked ember but angular is so much easier to work with
[09:41:24] <grafi> imjakechapman why dont you ask that in
[09:41:28] <grafi> #angularjs
[09:41:29] <grafi> xD
[09:41:32] <imjakechapman> ahh haha
[09:41:34] <awc737> how do I break out of my each loop, to return false for the method?
[09:41:35] <awc737> http://paste.laravel.com/HGz
[09:41:45] <imjakechapman> I'll get booted from the internet grafi haha
[09:41:47] <awc737> I don't want to just return false on the loop, but the entire method
[09:42:38] <ingodid> jquery multiseelct: found how to revert: jQuery('select').multiselect("destroy");
[09:42:45] <arkore> so, Bloomberg's question is why $(".ui-tabs-anchor:selected").on('click',function(){ alert('here'); }); is not working
[09:43:10] <arkore> my guess is because tabs() hasn't finished loading/initializing yet, or jquery-ui hasn't finish yet
[09:43:18] <arkore> http://jsbin.com/ijupum/1/edit
[09:44:03] <Bloomberg> arkore: what does that link?
[09:45:14] <arkore> Bloomberg, <grafi> http://jsbin.com/ijupum/5/ Bloomberg
[09:45:42] <arkore> does that answer your question?
[09:45:52] <Bloomberg> no man..
[09:45:57] <Bloomberg> is the opposite
[09:46:03] <Bloomberg> alert the current tab
[09:46:06] <Bloomberg> the same tab
[09:46:18] <imjakechapman> but in all seriousness guys… Angluar or Ember, anyone have some legit arguments for either
[09:46:26] <jacta> Is there a way to find what item number it is in a div? like $("div img").click shall alert what number image I just clicked, there could be 5 images in the div - is that possible?
[09:46:34] <Bloomberg> If the "2" tab is activated only this will show me an alert event
[09:46:39] <imjakechapman> I'm leaning towards Ember.js
[09:46:52] <grafi> Bloomberg good luck figuring that out, im giving up
[09:47:28] <duch_kazatel> Bloomberg your question is really bizarre in the first place.
[09:47:31] <grafi> imjakechapman what about Embular.js?
[09:47:34] <Saaether> imjakechapman depends on what kind of learning curve you're up for. ember requires alot more up front learning then angular
[09:47:55] <Bloomberg> So bizarre that you hasn't solve it!
[09:48:17] <imjakechapman> Saaether, so you don't mind the data binding, what about things like animations, and nested views etc..
[09:48:34] <duch_kazatel> Bloomberg So bizarre i'm refusing to help you because it's a really bad idea.
[09:49:06] <Bloomberg> Ok, thank you for the attemp+
[09:49:25] <Saaether> imjakechapman the thing that really bothered me when i went to learn ember was the documentation. their demo warns you that ember data is not prod ready and then continues to use ember data without any alternative heh
[09:51:32] <Saaether> i do like the way nested views are handled in ember, angular doesnt have that built in, but its not difficult to implement
[09:52:39] <arkore> yes, but duch_kazatel, Bloomberg has already done the code for it.  he's just wondering why it doesn't work.
[09:52:59] <arkore> i can't get it to work either, after I read http://api.jqueryui.com/tabs/#event-load
[09:53:14] <duch_kazatel> arkore right, and it's a really bad idea.
[09:54:04] <Bloomberg> I already have tested those options and doesn't works
[09:55:34] <arkore> Bloomberg, try this "$(".ui-tabs-active .ui-tabs-anchor").on('click',function(){ ... });"
[09:56:05] <jacta> How can I write this? $("#FrontSlider img:eq($(this).index())").toggle();
[09:56:18] <jacta> seems like its not that way, maybe something with the "" 's
[09:56:21] <duch_kazatel> arkore that won't work.  he's going to have to track which tab was last clicked and then see if the current click matches the last one.
[09:57:01] <Bloomberg> arkore: doesn't works, but many thanks by the attemp+
[09:57:09] <Bloomberg> Really thank you so much!
[09:57:13] <arkore> Bloomberg, wait
[09:57:20] <duch_kazatel> Bloomberg - I just said how to do it...
[09:57:24] <arkore> Bloomberg, try this: http://d.pr/i/ibjm
[09:57:58] <arkore> http://jsbin.com/ijupum/10/edit
[09:58:44] <Saaether> arkore your alert is triggered regardless of what tab you click on
[09:59:02] <duch_kazatel> it's supposed to only run if you click the currently active tab again.
[09:59:09] <arkore> err
[10:00:28] <Bloomberg> arkore: http://jsbin.com/ijupum/11/edit
[10:00:45] <Bloomberg> works, but anyway alert all atbs
[10:00:47] <Bloomberg> tabs*
[10:01:01] <arkore> Bloomberg, wait
[10:01:13] <arkore> thats wrong
[10:07:45] <nhulea> duch_kazatel: I wonder if that fetco dude will show again haha
[10:10:41] <duch_kazatel> nhulea he got banned yesterday!  i miss him now.
[10:11:12] <dwarder> hello guys, i have a local webserver (apache) and i use jquery ajax alot, i'm looking for a way to artificialy lower my internet speed, are there ready made solutions
[10:11:15] <dwarder> ?
[10:16:32] <nhulea> yeah the fun times we had
[10:18:20] <dwarder> nhulea: what times
[10:18:44] <duch_kazatel> dwarder a dude came in yesterday and started postin erotic fiction
[10:18:57] <nhulea> haha yeah what duch_kazatel said
[10:19:02] <nhulea> alot of it too
[10:19:08] <duch_kazatel> he got banned.
[10:19:20] <duch_kazatel> then somebody else showed up and said something about "fetco isn't here"
[10:19:22] <duch_kazatel> and left.
[10:19:35] <nhulea> that was almost weirder
[10:21:13] <dwarder> haha :)
[10:21:36] <dwarder> yeah he took hard for not posting porn instead ;)
[10:23:32] <arkore> Bloomberg, this is not proper coding, but it does the job.  http://jsbin.com/ijupum/14/edit
[10:26:13] <grafi> arkore but after clicking all them you always get the alert? how can that be right?
[10:26:29] <arkore> oops
[10:26:54] <grafi> not that have any clue what exactly its supposed to do ^^
[10:27:27] <arkore> ok, try again.  refresh: http://jsbin.com/ijupum/14/edit
[10:28:27] <grafi> so the user is supposed to click on the active tab?
[10:28:29] <grafi> hm
[10:28:34] <grafi> who would have guessed
[10:28:50] <arkore> from what i understand, Bloomberg wanted it so something happens when the current tab is clicked again
[10:28:52] <arkore> lol
[10:28:56] <ionico> hi
[10:29:06] <duch_kazatel> he wants to let users edit the current tab by clicking it a second time.
[10:29:17] <ionico> how can i modify this in order to allow decimal numbers: "/^[0-9\ ]+$/"
[10:29:21] <duch_kazatel> which is really strange and confusing to end users.
[10:29:21] <ionico> ?
[10:29:38] <arkore> duch_kazatel, lol
[10:29:54] <arkore> /^[0-9\ \.]+$/
[10:29:59] <duch_kazatel> seriously - i refused to help him because it's a bad idea.  Make an 'edit' link and bam, done
[10:31:28] <arkore> duch_kazatel, yah.  not sure why he doing it that way.  must be a new innovative "edit this area" approach/convention he's starting, where a "double click tab to edit" is a "feature"  ;)
[10:31:48] <duch_kazatel> :(
[10:32:01] <duch_kazatel> it's wrong i say!  wrong!  and nothin' can change my mind!
[10:33:36] <grafi> true that
[10:33:45] <arkore> lol
[10:33:54] <duch_kazatel> *true chat*
[10:34:05] <grafi> and the reason you cant to it with what .tabs() gives you is because its a bad idea ^^
[10:34:13] <duch_kazatel> heyooo!
[10:34:17] <grafi> all hail tabs
[10:34:23] <duch_kazatel> i need a beer after that one.
[10:34:31] <duch_kazatel> mental gymnastics and evertyhin.
[10:34:34] <duch_kazatel> *everything
[10:35:26] <arkore> or maybe it's sooo "right" that it blows your mind soo much that it inadvertently prohibits you from comprehending it as a "cool feature" , err, did i say that right?  heh
[10:35:47] <arkore> heh.  Web Usability!
[10:35:52] <duch_kazatel> no, you're not wearing a v-neck under a zip-up-hoodie under a sport coat while jeans and flip flops.
[10:36:04] <arkore> lol

[10:57:09] <arkore> thx for thxing.  unlike Bloomberg
[10:57:56] <arkore> well, Bloomberg did thx me, but that was for a broken version, and i said wait!  lol
[10:57:59] <rfk> Has anyone had experience with jQuery.data() returning NULL on non-NULL entries ?
[11:03:15] <Neillithan> Is there a way to use the joomla variables "siteurl" and "tmplurl" in jquery scripts?
[11:10:29] <arkore> Neillithan, yah
[11:10:51] <Neillithan> arkore: I think I might be doing this wrong then.
[11:10:57] <Neillithan> 			$('head').append('<link href="' + tmplurl + '"/zinoui/themes/dark/zino.core.css" type="text/css" rel="stylesheet">');
[11:11:20] <Neillithan> arkore: do you see what I"m doing wrong?
[11:11:45] <arkore> the script needs to be raw, in your php template, so you can use <?php echo $siteurl; ?>
[11:12:15] <arkore> $('head').append('<link href="<?php echo $siteurl; ?>/zi ...
[11:12:35] <Neillithan> arkore: I got it...
[11:12:41] <Neillithan> I typed it incorrectly

[11:31:56] <Bloomberg> arkore: still you are there?
[11:32:01] <Bloomberg> are you*
[11:32:25] <quantalrabbit> I have selected all anchor tags with $('a').  How do i make a list of the href attributes from that?
[11:33:42] <shoky> quantalrabbit: you can make an array with .map(), e.g.  $('a').map(function() { return $(this).attr('href') }).get()
[11:33:53] <Ansikt> quantalrabbit = urlList = []; $('a').each(function(){urlList[urlList.length] = jQuery(this).prop('href')});
[11:33:55] <grafi> magic
[11:34:53] <Ansikt> Oops, ignore the part of that where I said quantalRabbit = urlList :P
[11:35:13] <grafi> yeah, now hes a global variable oô
[11:35:16] <Bloomberg> arkore: Many thanks for your help, that was all that I needed
[11:35:21] <Bloomberg> Works perfect!
[11:35:25] <rfk> Does jQuery have an event for detecting when an element is attached to the tree? Would it be something like $(document).on('load', 'element-here', function () { .. }) ?
[11:35:37] <NoiseEee> rfk: no
[11:35:38] <Ansikt> grafi: not nessicarily, just one in a higher function scope. If he wraps it in a function, he's in the clear.
[11:35:54] <grafi> but you didnt
[11:35:55] <Vivekananda> hey everyone . What is wrong in here ? http://jsfiddle.net/PM7ME/5/
[11:35:58] <grafi> its all your fault ^^
[11:36:00] <rfk> Ah, so there is a native way to accomplish it?
[11:36:17] <Ansikt> rfk: no, but there is a native one, but it doesn't work quite like you're asking about, and its browser support is somewhere between 'crappy' and 'awful'
[11:36:35] <Ansikt> that being said, custom events are a fun, healthful activity for the whole family!
[11:37:48] <Ansikt> rfk: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/DOM/Events/Mutation_events
[11:37:54] <shoky> Vivekananda: not including jquery, and , instead of .
[11:38:29] <Vivekananda> did not get the part "not including jquery , " ?
[11:38:51] <shoky> Vivekananda: jquery isn't included in your fiddle
[11:39:13] <NoiseEee> rfk / Ansikt: http://davidwalsh.name/detect-node-insertion is a clever hack, ymmv
[11:40:19] <Vivekananda> shoky: how do I include it ? in the html ?
[11:40:52] <shoky> Vivekananda: in jsfiddle you can select jquery in the selectbox on the top-left where it says No-Library (pure JS)
[11:41:57] <Ansikt> NoiseEee, I can't imagine the browser support of that trick is any better than just using mutation events.
[11:42:34] <Ansikt> Though is it pretty clever
[11:43:21] <Vivekananda> shoky: okay I included jquery 10.1 but this one also has a . and not a , but works -- http://jsfiddle.net/PM7ME/3/
[11:43:27] <Vivekananda> and mine still does not work
[11:44:41] <shoky> Vivekananda: yours does work.. donno what you mean
[11:47:46] <arkore> Bloomberg, yup :)
[11:48:14] <yura___>           current_svg.fadeToggle(1000, 'swing', function() {
[11:48:14] <yura___>             setTimeout(function() { current_svg.fadeToggle(2000, 'swing');}, 1000);
[11:48:14] <yura___>           });
[11:48:33] <yura___> even such not working
[11:48:46] <blindMoe> is this considered valid in any way? $('storelocator-results').style.visibility = 'visible';
[11:48:54] <blindMoe> with no . or # in front of the selector
[11:49:27] <Vivekananda> shoky: this fiddle http://jsfiddle.net/PM7ME/7/ is not working . you told me to include jquery which I did . you told me to include , not . which I DID NOT. should I replace the . too ?
[11:49:27] <blindMoe> this is from a magento extension that I had to pay for so I assume it worked at some point ( doesn't work for me ).... could easily fix it but maybe there is something I don't know about happening here
[11:49:31] <Vivekananda> right now it does not work
[11:49:55] <yura___> $('storelocator-results').css('visibility', 'visible');
[11:50:01] <yura___> $('storelocator-results').css('visibility', 'visible');
[11:50:13] <yura___> sorry $('#storelocator-results').css('visibility', 'visible');
[11:50:22] <yura___> this one
[11:50:27] <blindMoe> yura___: I was asking more about the selector
[11:50:43] <blindMoe> never seen a selector for a non el type w/o a . or a # in front of it
[11:50:56] <blindMoe> maybe it is prototype and not jquery
[11:51:09] <yura___> no it's not correct
[11:51:31] <yura___> you need to use tage name, .class, or #id
[11:51:34] <blindMoe> I have a feeling it is prototype
[11:51:50] <yura___> yes
[11:52:12] <Ansikt> Vivekananda, Replace the comma with a period, why would you just ignore that?
[11:52:18] <Ansikt> Vivekananda, http://jsfiddle.net/PM7ME/9/
[11:53:37] <Ansikt> blindMoe: maybe.  Type $().jquery and see what happens
[11:54:00] <blindMoe> Ansikt: just realize this magento theme loads both prototype ( for magento ) and jQuery ( for itself )
[11:54:06] <blindMoe> let's hope noconflict is involved
[11:55:12] <shoky> Vivekananda: look at line 1. there is a comma ,  instead of a dot .
[11:55:17] <Ansikt> Yeah, I've always found $ being the symbol for both to be extremely annoying, as our site has a vendor plugin which uses stupid prototype.
[11:57:03] <bjorn_> hey anyone know a quick way to load the text boxs on this site only after the associated image shows
[11:57:04] <bjorn_> http://backofhouse.morganshotelgroup.com/
[11:57:18] <Vivekananda> shoky: shoot my font was so small on jfiddle could not see it . sorry sorry my bad. okay fixed it and it is clear.
[11:57:35] <Vivekananda> shoky: also how do I clear the value right after the
[11:57:39] <Vivekananda> pop up ?
[11:58:06] <shoky> Vivekananda: this.value = '';
[12:00:36] <Vivekananda> shoky: isthere something like this.clear() ?
[12:01:20] <shoky> Vivekananda: i just told you how to clear it
[12:28:25] <RRR2> Can you remove a .on listener
[12:28:54] <shoky> .off
[12:31:18] <plambwk> hi friends

[12:31:30] <plambwk> http://jsfiddle.net/3JzDh/

[12:31:40] <plambwk> http://codepen.io/jbatzel1/pen/DICGB
[12:34:22] <shoky> plambwk: because there's a js syntax error   Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token ;

[12:35:57] <plambwk> whats wrong with line 3 (sorry im a complete JS newb)
[12:36:21] <shoky> sorry i had it tidied up, its not line 3

[12:37:22] <shoky> not really
[12:37:29] <plambwk> lol
[12:37:30] <shoky> and anyway, it shouldn't be that
[12:37:48] <plambwk> oh

[12:48:22] <danols_work> I have an element - how can I find it's children matching a certain selector that - I am trying to do $(this).children('option') but get no results
[12:48:45] <shoky> danols_work: .children finds only direct children. maybe you want .find
[12:48:57] <shoky> oh tho if it's a select then children should work fine
[12:48:58] <danols_work> i tired find too
[12:49:09] <shoky> welp. make a jsfiddle
[12:49:23] <danols_work> yes I agree - that's why I am here
[12:49:43] <danols_work> https://join.me/966-690-991
[12:50:10] <danols_work> hi to whoever joined
[12:50:41] <duch_kazatel> woah jsfiddle yo - not some screencap setup.
[12:50:51] <shoky> ^
[12:50:53] <danols_work> tis the future
[12:51:05] <danols_work> I'm sure JSFiddle will work - so just bear with me
[12:51:14] <shoky> danols_work: just a simple jsfiddle please. we don't know what you're showing or what your setup is etc.
[12:51:20] <danols_work> maybe this is not referencing what I think it is
[12:51:38] <shoky> maybe, how are we supposed to know
[12:51:55] <danols_work> can you see the screen ?
[12:52:00] <duch_kazatel> ...
[12:52:05] <shoky> yes.. i can't control it though
[12:52:07] <duch_kazatel> link top jsfidddle, not your screencast.
[12:52:09] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/
[12:52:10] <shoky> so it's not of big help
[12:52:16] <danols_work> k
[12:52:31] <danols_work> let me figure it out a little more on my own
[12:52:42] <danols_work> I'm sure this is not referencing what I think it should
[12:52:56] <shoky> type 'this' into your conslle to show what  it is
[12:53:04] <danols_work> I have
[12:53:16] <shoky> expand that
[12:53:16] <danols_work> it's a different ID - it's of the select2 widget not mine
[12:53:32] <danols_work> shoky yes
[12:54:41] <shoky> danols_work: it's not an element
[12:55:31] <danols_work> it's an object
[12:55:41] <shoky> it doesn't have children/descendant nodes, cause it's not a node
[12:55:50] <danols_work> yes starting to see that too
[12:56:07] <danols_work> one of these attributes I would assume links to the select that this widget replaces
[12:56:10] <danols_work> just need to drill down

[12:57:36] <danols_work> thank you all
[12:59:53] <maxmoore14> anybody know I can detect charcodes for special symbols above the number keys during a keydown event?
[13:00:30] <maxmoore14> is there something on the event object that tells me if shift is being held?
[13:01:16] <duch_kazatel> maxmoore14 - what's the core problem you're trying to solve?
[13:01:22] <Sendoushi> the code works just... trying to improve the way i write code. the code works just... trying to improve the way i write code
[13:02:14] <maxmoore14> duch_kazatel: I'm building a calculator, I have clickable buttons, but I'm also trying to capture keyboard events for numbers, math operators, etc.
[13:02:30] <ajmrsn> why does my function scoped variable (var x = {}) reset inside of $('.selector').each( function (index) { x[ index ] = true; } ); but x only contains the values from the last iteration
[13:04:13] <duch_kazatel> maxmoore14 - ah, in that case, you need to look at the keyup/keydown events separately and figure it out yourself :)
[13:04:20] <duch_kazatel> see if shift is also down when you hit your key, etc.
[13:05:22] <maxmoore14> duch_kazatel: so I have to catch the shift key up/down events and track it?
[13:05:27] <maxmoore14> lovely!
[13:05:51] <duch_kazatel> sure, but you're in #jquery - I'd look at things jquery can offer you :)
[13:06:18] <maxmoore14> that's why I'm asking... is there a better way to detect it?
[13:06:50] <maxmoore14> I'm using the normalized event.which for the char code which is useful
[13:07:16] <duch_kazatel> that's basically you're only real bet.
[13:07:56] <maxmoore14> ok, here's a separate question... how do I go from charcode to string?
[13:08:11] <duch_kazatel> you have to encode it.
[13:08:16] <maxmoore14> some work with String.fromCharCode()
[13:08:33] <maxmoore14> but the number pad is translating to letters
[13:12:13] <duch_kazatel> not sure - you'd have to look at maybe converting using raw js or google it elsehwere.
[13:12:19] <duch_kazatel> sorry, getting sidetracked at work.
[13:13:13] <Sendoushi> guys... http://pastebin.com/Vh3PzCX5 this code is working but... how would improve the way it's written? trying to improve my code
[13:14:59] <Vivekananda> anyone take  a look at this http://jsfiddle.net/PM7ME/13/ tell me what is wrong
[13:16:21] <Sendoushi> Vivekananda: checking
[13:17:19] <AwesomePossum_> can you bind a change event to a list object within the dom?
[13:17:40] <Vivekananda> Sendoushi: the regex part does not work
[13:17:44] <Vivekananda> the first one works
[13:17:47] <Vivekananda> ie the if part
[13:17:53] <Sendoushi> can't help you there :s
[13:18:02] <Sendoushi> don't know anything about regex :(
[13:24:58] <Vivekananda> anyone esle here
[13:25:19] <AwesomePossum> Vivekananda: Me
[13:26:24] <Vivekananda> AwesomePossum: you know regex ?

[13:28:13] <BillCriswell> I think my IRC client broke.
[13:28:24] <BillCriswell> Hello?

[13:29:11] <Vivekananda> BillCriswell: hello
[13:29:16] <Vivekananda> you know a little regex ?
[13:29:36] <BillCriswell> I dabble.
[13:30:23] <ajmrsn> why does var selection in http://dpaste.com/1336045/ only contain the values from the last iteration?
[13:30:32] <ajmrsn> I'm not overwriting the selection variable am I?
[13:31:16] <ajmrsn> also I should say var selection contains both the values of the last iteration plus the 'test' field
[13:31:41] <ajmrsn> example var selection = {"13":{"1":true},"test":"00 1 2 3 "}
[13:32:17] <ajmrsn> there should be more "13":{"3":true}, "11":{"2":true}, etc
[13:34:22] <arkore> you might be doing it wrong
[13:34:53] <reks> http://moveword.blogspot.com

[13:48:49] <Rarrikins> What arguments are passed to the function used with replaceWith?
[13:50:22] <BillCriswell> Rarrikins: Doesn't look like anything.
[13:51:20] <BillCriswell> Rarrikins: Actually. Seems like function( index, whatIsBeingReplaced )
[13:52:27] <BillCriswell> whatIsBeingReplaced is just a string.
[13:53:16] <BillCriswell> $('*').replaceWith(function(){ console.log( arguments ); }) That was a fun one to run
[13:54:56] <Vivekananda> NoiseEee: this one works but it is not working on my page. I wonder why. http://jsfiddle.net/PM7ME/16/.   i used the same thing in a myQuery.js file and included it in the html right below a jquerysource.js file
[13:55:18] <Vivekananda> do I have to do something like $(document).ready(function() {} ?
[13:55:29] <BillCriswell> What in the hell.
[13:56:09] <NoiseEee> Vivekananda: well certainly the element with the id #telephone needs to be in the DOM for it to work.  yes, use document.ready or put your stuff before </body>
[13:56:42] <Vivekananda> NoiseEee: It is in the body and id is "telephone" for an input called telphone
[13:57:11] <NoiseEee> Vivekananda: put it in document ready
[13:57:11] <arkore> ajmrsn, yes, you need to fix it
[13:57:57] <Rarrikins> BillCriswell: Is there any way to get the tag that was searched for? It seems to only show the nested tags.
[13:58:31] <BillCriswell> Vivekananda: That code is doing some voodoo shit for me.
[14:00:00] <BillCriswell> Vivekananda: When I tab from that field it adds a tab to the inputs value.
[14:00:08] <BillCriswell> Rarrikins: Not sure I'm following you there.
[14:00:26] <Vivekananda> BillCriswell: hahaha hmm
[14:00:45] <BillCriswell> If I click away from the input it works, tabbing away it shits the bed.
[14:00:46] <Vivekananda> but why would it do that
[14:01:06] <Rarrikins> BillCriswell: It doesn't include the enclosing <tagname> and </tagname>.
[14:01:19] <graphettion> I'm trying to change the background color of the page with a select box. I guess I'm not sure how to accomplish this. Any ideas? - http://jsfiddle.net/xCxYC/
[14:01:41] <Rarrikins> BillCriswell: So, if I want to process based on attributes of that tag, I can't with this specific method.
[14:01:55] <Rarrikins> BillCriswell: I think I'll probably have to do $('tagname').each()
[14:03:02] <BillCriswell> Rarrikins: You can wrap() up this and search within that, but it seems weird to do. Are you only trying to do replaceWith on certain elements from a collection?
[14:03:07] <Vivekananda> BillCriswell: something like this would work jsfiddle.net/PM7ME/16/
[14:03:08] <Vivekananda> ?
[14:03:57] <Rarrikins> BillCriswell: No, I have something like <api-method type="GET" name="/zomg">...</api-method> and I want to take that when the page loads and replace it with nice HTML.
[14:04:15] <Rarrikins> BillCriswell: So, it'll be all elements in the collection.
[14:04:43] <Rarrikins> BillCriswell: But I need the attributes of the enclosing tag.

[14:08:49] <Rarrikins> OK, thanks for your help with it.
[14:08:58] <BillCriswell> No problem.
[14:10:38] <ajmrsn> arkore: why do you bother with me?  Your input does not help me in any way.
[14:10:46] <BillCriswell> Vivekananda: I have no idea why the tabs are showing up.

[14:28:40] <duch_kazatel> baordog - "load a new element" and "switching out an img src" are two different things.
[14:29:07] <baordog> Aherm, change the img's source.
[14:29:19] <duch_kazatel> you could set the src attribute.
[14:29:31] <BillCriswell> Hmmm...

[14:29:46] <sunbeam> does anyone know a good jQuery plugin that provides 2 select fields to convert currencies?
[14:30:38] <duch_kazatel> baordog that... doesn't make sense.  you just set the attribute of the image source.
[14:31:03] <baordog> duch_kazatel:  How do I do that without reloading the page?
[14:31:19] <baordog> Once it's set in the first place, it's set isn't it?
[14:31:36] <duch_kazatel> ... "without reloading the page"?
[14:31:46] <duch_kazatel> you're not - you're changing a single image.
[14:32:46] <baordog> Well, I'm seeing the flow here as jquery talks to my php , php to my database and that returns the new file name which javascript puts in the image src tag
[14:33:03] <baordog> I don't think php can change the image source without re-rendering the entire page.
[14:33:03] <duch_kazatel> correct.  how does that reload the entire page?
[14:33:18] <duch_kazatel> baordog - you're not using PHP, you're using jquery.
[14:33:28] <baordog> duch_kazatel:  That doesn't. I here to ask you guys what the best jquery function to do that was. post? load?
[14:33:48] <duch_kazatel> .attr()
[14:34:14] <duch_kazatel> why are you posting anything?  if you just want to change an image, change the source of that image... that should work just fine.
[14:34:46] <baordog> because I need to post to my php script to get the updated db information? Something has to talk to my database
[14:35:18] <duch_kazatel> there we go - that part was important.
[14:35:42] <baordog> baordog	Specifically, I have a page where you change the default picture in the DB, and I want the representation to change with your choices
[14:35:58] <duch_kazatel> your original question and that question were two different things.
[14:36:29] <duch_kazatel> ajax() might serve your needs.
[14:36:34] <baordog> Well that's what I need... so post? or load?
[14:36:35] <duch_kazatel> if you need to load something back into the page/.
[14:36:52] <duch_kazatel> you can run requests using .ajax() that might have what you need.
[14:37:19] <baordog> Well I have to call something to rerender that element?
[14:38:01] <duch_kazatel> yes... when you submit your data, you then have to handle the response in your PHP - when that spits out whatever, you need to then push that into the page.
[14:38:10] <duch_kazatel> you could havew the PHP give you the correct URL, for instance.
[14:38:13] <duch_kazatel> then swap your src.
[14:38:37] <BillCriswell> Where would you file a chrome bug?
[14:41:11] <baordog> duch_kazatel:  This might better explain http://pastie.org/8219905
[14:42:10] <duch_kazatel> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.post/#jQuery-post-url-data-successdata--textStatus--jqXHR-dataType
[14:42:35] <duch_kazatel> .post has a variant that's a shorthand for ajax - you need to define a success callback that handles the data the server returns.
[14:43:04] <baordog> that would be a javascript function?
[14:43:42] <duch_kazatel> correct - on a success event, you'd call back to a js function that would then use the info it got from the server and do whatever.
[14:44:02] <baordog> and the data is just sent to the variable "data"?
[14:48:12] <duch_kazatel> look at the page I linked about the .post() method documentation - it contains exactly what you want.
[14:49:49] <baordog> Well yeah, I just don't understand the notation. It says data: data. Does that mean that your data is the mandatory provided data variable, or is it saying that it will put your data in whatever variable you choose, in this case that's data.
[14:52:11] <duch_kazatel> let's look at this case; $.post("test.php", function(data) {alert("Data Loaded: " + data);});
[14:52:37] <duch_kazatel> that's saying "post against test.php - on success, call a function and pass it the returned data.
[14:52:39] <duch_kazatel> "
[14:52:56] <baordog> Right, but is data a variable that you choose, or a standard mandatory variable?
[14:53:12] <duch_kazatel> in the notation i provided, one you choose.
[14:53:23] <baordog> ok
[14:53:33] <duch_kazatel> you should probably learn about how callbacks and functions work with jquery.
[14:53:38] <duch_kazatel> :)
[14:54:05] <baordog> I really need to thoroughly learn it, I've been hacking examples and it hasn't been good for me
[14:54:14] <duch_kazatel> very much so.
[14:54:18] <baordog> I do better when I know the deeper innerworkings of things
[14:57:01] <JFranks> When I use a tooltip and change the contents of the element holding the item containing the tooltip, especially on Firefox, the tooltip will get stuck on the screen: http://jsbin.com/ivebom/2
[14:57:29] <JFranks> (Click the refresh icon)
[15:04:26] <okdamn> daaamn i forgot where i putted a piece of jquery that binds an event on keyup or keydown
[15:04:43] <okdamn> how can i check which event is binded to an element? :/
[15:05:26] <okdamn> wtffff i can't find it :/
[15:05:27] <okdamn> help me
[15:05:53] <JFranks> okdamn: Using webkit/chrome?
[15:05:54] <okdamn> an input text as a jquery event binded BUT I CAN?T FIND THAT ON the html OMG
[15:06:00] <okdamn> yeah
[15:06:01] <Rarrikins> How do I get children() to treat <tag /><tag /> as separate children rather than nesting the second one inside the first?
[15:06:03] <okdamn> chrome and firefox
[15:06:26] <okdamn> JFranks:  can you help this stupid okdamn? :P
[15:06:40] <JFranks> Inspect the element.. bottom right at the bottom of the scroll .. is 'event listeners'
[15:07:54] <Rarrikins> It works fine if I have <tag></tag><tag></tag>.
[15:08:15] <okdamn> JFranks:  i have not :/
[15:08:19] <okdamn> in chrome
[15:08:28] <okdamn> i inspect element but bottom right there are options
[15:09:00] <okdamn> oh no sorry i found
[15:09:08] <okdamn> but can't find where is the piece of code
[15:09:17] <okdamn> it links jquery file as binder
[15:09:57] <ralphholzmann> wtf
[15:09:57] <JFranks> is the binder full of women?
[15:09:57] <sammich> if you're in chrome/webkit, hit resources in inspector, hit ctrl-F, and start typing
[15:10:02] <ralphholzmann> you can pass a boolean to $.fn.toggle
[15:10:07] <ralphholzmann> but not to $.fn.slideToggle
[15:10:19] <okdamn> lol
[15:10:33] <okdamn> how do i find the exact place of the script involved? :/
[15:11:17] <doug65536> okdamn: with a text editor
[15:11:46] <okdamn> doug65536:  i tryed find globally on Sublime Text but i can't find anything :/
[15:11:47] <okdamn> omg
[15:11:55] <doug65536> does it have an id?
[15:12:40] <doug65536> complaining about not being able to find it without showing any code isn't going to get you any help
[15:12:43] <JFranks> okdamn: There's, as you can see, lots of listeners for each element, so sometimes it's easier to review your script (text editor is good for this) and try to make sense of what's attaching to what..
[15:13:09] <okdamn> damn it's unbelievable
[15:13:13] <okdamn> i' can't find it :D
[15:13:20] <okdamn> simply unbelivable
[15:13:32] <okdamn> i did both search on('keydown and on('keyup
[15:13:37] <okdamn> nothing comes up related :7
[15:13:51] <doug65536> is regex enabled? ( will not mean ( if so
[15:14:06] <JFranks> Try to take anything you can see that gives away secret info out of the code and then paste it into pastebin.com / jsbin.com / jsfiddle.com
[15:14:22] <doug65536> secret info in javascript eh?
[15:14:53] <JFranks> Yeah .. like "if(password = '$topsecr3t')"
[15:14:56] <JFranks> HAHAH
[15:15:06] <okdamn> pfff unbelievable guys
[15:15:12] <okdamn> there is a ghost here
[15:15:12] <okdamn> :/
[15:15:15] <duch_kazatel> yeah guys
[15:15:20] <JFranks> duch!
[15:15:39] <duch_kazatel> ?!
[15:15:52] <duch_kazatel> how goes?
[15:15:56] <JFranks> Solve my problem! http://jsbin.com/ivebom/3
[15:16:06] <JFranks> I mean.. yeah! How's it going! ;)
[15:16:27] <duch_kazatel> i assume your problem is you want it to hide that tooltip when you click?
[15:16:30] <JFranks> When you click the refresh the tooltip sticks there.. Almost everytime in FireFox
[15:16:40] <JFranks> Very rarely in WebKit ;)
[15:17:20] <okdamn> WTF I FOUND IT!!! WTFFFFFFF
[15:17:26] <duch_kazatel> i'd say you should bind an event onmouseout or whatever that hides it.
[15:17:34] <okdamn> it wasn't js :/
[15:17:39] <duch_kazatel> (can't code it right now in the middle of something else)
[15:17:41] <duch_kazatel> and wat
[15:17:42] <okdamn> it was an hidden input submit pffff
[15:18:01] <doug65536> okdamn: you done spamming the channel with complaints then?
[15:18:19] <okdamn> no no i'm out sorry
[15:18:27] <okdamn> but it was like searching in the dark :/
[15:18:28] <JFranks> okdamn: You understand that $( "p").click(function() {$( this ).slideUp();});  ... would bind 'onclick' to all <p> elements?
[15:19:01] <okdamn> JFranks:  yeah yeah sorry but as i told you it wasn't js binded
[15:19:12] <okdamn> so there was no js or jquery at all binded :/:
[15:19:24] <JFranks> Oh.. It was inline? and lurking in the code?
[15:19:31] <JFranks> Gotcha
[15:20:50] <archfool> I have a mobile page that is a set of "collapsible" under a "collapsible-set".  Is there a way to make a button or another div LOOK like a collapsible, but really be a plain <a href>?
[15:21:45] <okdamn> sorry guys which is the keycode for enter key?
[15:21:52] <okdamn> 13 ?
[15:22:03] <okdamn> it works on all devices?
[15:22:15] <duch_kazatel> archfool - you're going to have to copy the styles and manually apply them yourself, though I'd suggest not doing that.
[15:22:22] <duch_kazatel> it'll confuse your end users.
[15:22:23] <duch_kazatel> aaaan dbrb
[15:22:29] <Surkow|laptop> hi guys
[15:23:36] <nhulea> hey I was looking to show() or hide based doff of date range anyone ever do that before ?
[15:23:37] <Surkow|laptop> I have a question about determining the height of a paragraph with jquery
[15:23:56] <archfool> yeah, I was hoping not to duplicate or change CSS.
[15:23:58] <Surkow|laptop> when I check if the height is set to "auto" it fails, because firefox retuns pixels
[15:24:03] <Surkow|laptop> *returns
[15:24:18] <JFranks> nhulea: Dates and date formats SUCK
[15:24:32] <Surkow|laptop> instead of checking if something is set to auto, I figured I'd try this method: http://jsfiddle.net/UpBtx/
[15:24:37] <Surkow|laptop> but to no avail
[15:24:42] <nhulea> yeah basically I have to show a div if it falls within a date range
[15:24:49] <Surkow|laptop> anything I'm doing wrong?
[15:25:18] <nhulea> JFranks: have you done that before?
[15:25:19] <Surkow|laptop> I'm trying to make a few lines visible by clicking "more"
[15:25:25] <JFranks> nhulea: If the div's innerHTML 'contains' a date?
[15:26:07] <JFranks> nhulea: ie: <div id="checkme">2013-11-05</div> ?
[15:26:19] <nhulea> I have a jquery ui datepicker and I can get the .val() of it then if that date falls within a certin range then show()
[15:29:15] <JFranks> nhulea: I don't think you'll find much in the default jquery to do that.. probably end up using some base JS.. ie: Date();
[15:30:09] <JFranks> nhulea: http://jsbin.com/osanaj/1/edit
[15:31:03] <nhulea> jFranks ok that looks doable for sure
[15:37:25] <Rarrikins> How do I get jQuery to properly handle tags with trailing slashes? It sees them as opening tags.
[15:41:57] <duch_kazatel> Rarrikins have an example?
[15:48:06] <initself> not sure how to google what i'm looknig for
[15:48:20] <initself> i'm trying to create a simple select box that has "categories" that are unselectable
[15:48:59] <initself> -+ Clothing +- TShirt Pants  | -+ States +- CA AZ FL |
[15:49:04] <initself> something like that
[15:49:22] <duch_kazatel> you tryed the "disabled" attribute on the option, right?
[15:49:34] <initself> doesn't that just gray it out?
[15:49:38] <initself> oh, then i can style it
[15:49:40] * initself tries
[15:50:11] <duch_kazatel> remember that greyed out content means "disabled" - don't muck with that too much since it's what users expect.
[15:51:28] <initself> duch_kazatel++
[15:52:09] <duch_kazatel> with few exceptions, i don't get why people are into changing every little thing.  users are used to something.  unless you have a really good reason, stick with convention
[15:52:43] <initself> duch_kazatel: well it isn't a selectable option
[15:53:51] <duch_kazatel> then why put it inside the selectbox?  Why not make it the heading for the select box?
[15:54:16] <initself> because the select box has multiple choices of stuff?
[15:54:24] <initself> they are all "premiums" of different types
[15:54:27] <duch_kazatel> unless you're using it to do like nested categorical stuff, in which case you should probably reconsider what you're trying to do.
[15:54:32] <initself> the way it looksright now is pretty rad
[15:55:06] <duch_kazatel> lol ok.  just be careful.
[15:56:05] <zizzl> Hey guys whats the script called that, when having a responsive site and you change the window size, you can see all the div's/etc floating to their respective position... or is this just css3?
[15:56:20] <duch_kazatel> wat
[15:56:30] <duch_kazatel> you mean how do you control that?
[15:56:35] <duch_kazatel> media queries - CSS3 feature :3
[15:58:04] <zizzl> ok I swear I've seen some responsive sites that do that, thought it was a script
[15:58:19] <duch_kazatel> "floating"?
[15:58:25] <duch_kazatel> not sure what you mean, really.
[15:59:06] <zizzl> transitioning smoothly to their position
[15:59:37] <zizzl> like if you had 3 columned divs and you shirnk the browser window they slide below each other
[16:00:11] <doug65536> zizzl: that sounds like the masonry library
[16:00:15] <duch_kazatel> do you mean like a smooth animated effect?
[16:00:18] <duch_kazatel> oooh yeah.
[16:00:21] <duch_kazatel> that does.
[16:01:15] <zizzl> ahh thanks
[16:01:27] <zizzl> is that specific to what i need or is that one of the many functions masonry does
[16:01:39] <doug65536> I have a fiddle that shows it
[16:01:47] <doug65536> how do you search fiddles
[16:02:32] <zizzl> google "site:jsfiddle.net searchterms"
[16:02:50] <initself> duch_kazatel: maybe im actually looking for optgroup?
[16:03:23] <duch_kazatel> initself - no clue what you're trying to do...
[16:03:55] <duch_kazatel> do you have an example?
[16:03:57] <initself> well, optgroup is what i'm trying to do - group select options into groups
[16:04:01] <initself> it works great!
[16:04:15] <initself> i didn't know you that particular markup until i just found it on SO
[16:04:29] <duch_kazatel> then there you go.
[16:04:34] <initself> indeed!
[16:05:11] <doug65536> zizzl: http://jsfiddle.net/dagMd/70/
[16:05:23] <doug65536> zizzl: resize it
[16:05:26] <doug65536> click them
[16:05:56] <doug65536> zizzl: there's a bug but it demos what you're after I think
[16:06:37] <doug65536> zizzl: was trying to debug issue with hiding/showing divs
[16:10:30] <archfool> in a collapsible widget, is there a way to override the expand/collapse action and override with a custom jquery code?
[16:13:00] <Rarrikins> duch_kazatel: Something like <zomg /><kthx /> is seen as <zomg><kthx></kthx></zomg> instead of <zomg></zomg><kthx></kthx>.
[16:14:15] <duch_kazatel> use case?
[16:14:17] <duch_kazatel> jsfiddle helps.
[16:16:31] <Rarrikins> duch_kazatel: I have custom tags I'm replacing with HTML via jQuery. I'd like the tags to be replaced to be shorter, because otherwise I'll have a lot of closing tags right after opening tags.
[16:16:32] <doug65536> Rarrikins: what do you mean by "is seen as"
[16:17:05] <duch_kazatel> Rarrikins - you do know that some tags cannot be made self closing, right?
[16:17:18] <duch_kazatel> it is not valid - which jquery often expects.
[16:17:23] <Rarrikins> doug65536: I mean that, for instance, if I have <zomg><kthx /><kthx /><kthx /></zomg>, the kthxs are seen as children of each other (it nests each kthx inside the previous) rather than all being siblings.
[16:17:51] <duch_kazatel> Rarrikins - this is why actual code is helpful - some tags cannot be self-closing.
[16:17:51] <Rarrikins> duch_kazatel: What about custom tags (not HTML tags)?
[16:18:02] <Rarrikins> How do you declare tags to be self-closing?
[16:18:13] <duch_kazatel> you can't create custom tags on the fly...
[16:18:15] <doug65536> Rarrikins: how do you know they are being treated as children? you're calling $("zomg").find("kthx") ?
[16:18:18] <duch_kazatel> what "custom tags" are you making.
[16:18:32] <Rarrikins> doug65536: Because $('zomg').children() only gives the first.
[16:18:47] <Rarrikins> doug65536: $('zomg').children('kthx').children() gives the second.
[16:19:07] <duch_kazatel> again - you cannot create tags on the fly.
[16:19:26] <Rarrikins> How do you properly create tags?
[16:19:32] <duch_kazatel> you cannot.
[16:19:33] <doug65536> Rarrikins: you don't
[16:19:35] <Rarrikins> Oh.
[16:19:39] <duch_kazatel> there is no way to "create tags"
[16:19:42] <doug65536> Rarrikins: but there may be a proper way to do what you want
[16:19:45] <duch_kazatel> you must use the ones predefined by the spec.
[16:19:47] <duch_kazatel> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/HTML5/HTML5_element_list
[16:19:48] <doug65536> Rarrikins: why are you making up tags?
[16:19:59] <archfool> you can make up "tags" in XML, not HTML
[16:20:07] <arkore> <box title="hello">test</box>
[16:20:10] <Rarrikins> So that, regardless of what the HTML surrounding it is, the tags are unique.
[16:20:22] <doug65536> Rarrikins: that's what id is for
[16:20:25] <duch_kazatel> Rarrikins HTML doesn't work that way.
[16:20:31] <doug65536> Rarrikins: <div id="something"></div>
[16:20:39] <doug65536> $('#something')...
[16:21:10] <Rarrikins> Ahh, OK
[16:21:25] <doug65536> Rarrikins: if you need to identify multiple things of a certain "made up" tag, use a class name
[16:21:44] <doug65536> <div class="critical"></div>   <div class="critical"></div>
[16:22:05] <Rarrikins> Alright; that makes sense.
[16:22:05] <doug65536> $(".critical").css({"background-color": "red"})
[16:22:06] <duch_kazatel> that's an important note - IDs must always be unique per page.
[16:22:14] <duch_kazatel> classes don't need to be unique.
[16:23:15] <doug65536> Rarrikins: a single object can have multiple classes, some may have css rules: <div class="floating_box critical"></div>
[16:23:27] <Rarrikins> Oh, I know :)
[16:23:32] <doug65536> floating_box may have css rules, while css is just to find those things in jquery
[16:23:39] <duch_kazatel> where'd you get the impression you could make custom tags?
[16:23:41] <doug65536> while critical is just...
[16:23:48] <duch_kazatel> from XML?
[16:23:53] <Rarrikins> duch_kazatel: Yeah.
[16:23:57] <duch_kazatel> aaah
[16:23:59] <duch_kazatel> fair enough
[16:24:16] <Rarrikins> Thanks for the help :)
[16:24:25] <doug65536> Rarrikins: data tags can help too
[16:24:40] <doug65536> Rarrikins: if you need to "attach" some custom info to an element
[16:25:21] <doug65536> <div data-productid="1234">...</div>    $('div').each(function() { $(this).data("productid"); })
[16:25:28] <doug65536> extracts product id from the div tag
[16:25:40] <archfool> How do I force a "click/tap" to load a URL?  $('#myid').on('click', function () {  ???? });
[16:26:03] <duch_kazatel> archfool you mean like if the element were an anchor?
[16:26:08] <archfool> indeed
[16:26:20] <doug65536> location.href =
[16:26:26] <doug65536> assign the url
[16:26:45] <doug65536> archfool: ^
[16:26:50] <duch_kazatel> location.href = 'http://google.com', for instance
[16:26:59] <duch_kazatel> (no comma, obvi)
[16:27:26] <archfool> works.  Not elegant, but works.  But this whole thing is a hack anwyay. :(
[16:27:36] <duch_kazatel> how is that not "elegant"?
[16:27:56] <archfool> I'm hacking it into a collapsible widget which opens first, then loads the new page, and no spinner. :/
[16:28:16] <archfool> I want the "collapsible" look and feel, WITHOUT the action. ;)
[16:28:28] <archfool> is what I REALLY want
[16:28:28] <duch_kazatel> whaaaa okay.
[16:28:51] <viktorminator> hi all! how to increase value of tag attribute on 5, for example?
[16:29:00] <archfool> Our whole page is a collapsible-set.  If I use anything else, look and feel goes out the window. :(
[16:29:23] <archfool> And I need the horizontal bar and arrow of the collapsible, but acting as an anchor
[16:29:37] <duch_kazatel> archfool that's really strange, but ok.
[16:29:47] <doug65536> archfool: sounds like a "make work" project
[16:29:47] <duch_kazatel> and viktorminator - that question makes no sense.
[16:29:58] <duch_kazatel> yeah...
[16:30:01] <archfool> No... it's... hack this new feature in cause we don't wanna do it right
[16:30:19] <archfool> 99% of customers will have data inside the collapsible.  The other 1% we want to send to another site.
[16:30:35] <viktorminator> for example, I have <button data-offset="">Click me</a> after each click I need to increase number on 5, so after 1st click it'd be <button data-offset="5">Click me</a>
[16:30:53] <duch_kazatel> archfool why are you building your product to send users elsewhere?
[16:30:56] <doug65536> archfool: I would be annoyed if I were a user and clicked a collapsable header and it loaded another page
[16:31:03] <duch_kazatel> ^^^
[16:31:04] <viktorminator> after 2nd click <button data-offset="10">Click me</button>
[16:31:07] <doug65536> archfool: that's what links are for
[16:31:12] <archfool> Normally the data comes from us.  This is external data. So we send them external.
[16:31:45] <archfool> yes... I know that's what anchors are for... but I cannot figure out how to get a BUTTON to look like the collapsible, or else the look and feel looks horrid.
[16:32:23] <doug65536> archfool: I would suggest, if it is going to be a link, then make the content of the collapsible section have a link in it
[16:32:53] <doug65536> so the user can decide if they want to go to another page, instead of throwing them out
[16:32:58] <duch_kazatel> and viktorminator- on the first click you'd set the .data('offset') = 5, and then every subsequent click do something like .data('offset') += 5
[16:32:58] <archfool> That's just as hacked as what I've got. ;)  why should the user need to click twice?  one for expand, second for link?
[16:33:18] <doug65536> archfool: because you would be booting them out unexpectedly?
[16:33:18] <nhulea> Hey is there a good way to format dates ?
[16:33:35] <duch_kazatel> archfool - sending the user to a different page shouldn't happen at all on that interaction.
[16:33:36] <archfool> nhulea: people have been shot in here for saying less. ;)
[16:33:41] <viktorminator> thanks, duch_kazatel
[16:34:00] <duch_kazatel> make a section called "External Links" or something, but you'll actually lose users with your method.
[16:34:06] <duch_kazatel> they will not come back as a result.
[16:34:10] <doug65536> archfool: I believe the user should be in control, you shouldnt push them around unexpectedly
[16:34:24] <duch_kazatel> ^^^
[16:34:25] <archfool> And having a link would be different how?
[16:34:36] <archfool> I want the collapsible to BE the anchor
[16:34:36] <duch_kazatel> because you're setting a precedent with those headings.
[16:34:46] <duch_kazatel> once you change that behavior, the user will think it's dumb.
[16:34:56] <archfool> Our whole UI is dumb anyway. ;)
[16:35:02] <duch_kazatel> you're saying "most of the time, this will happen - when suddenly!"
[16:35:15] <archfool> We load the data for the whole site into the page as it is.
[16:35:39] <archfool> Most of the time == most customers.  This customer is using a SEPARATE service for the data.
[16:35:54] <archfool> The users for this site will always see this behavior.  Users for normal sites will have normal behavior
[16:36:07] <duch_kazatel> that... doesn't make sense.
[16:36:19] <nhulea> archfool: I find that a bit extreme -- I have an alert spitting out a date Sun Aug 2013 00:00:00 GMT -0700 (Pacific Daylight Time) and I wanted to get it too MM/DD/YYYY
[16:36:23] <duch_kazatel> but whatever - I used to work at a place that did stuff like that and we wondered why our visitors werre dropping like flies.
[16:36:36] <archfool> our customers buy web sites from us. end-users use the product.  site A has "data" internal to us.  site B has data external.
[16:36:47] <duch_kazatel> yup, sounds about right.
[16:36:58] <archfool> That's the problem.  Our "users" are not the customers.  They are the customers' customers.
[16:36:59] <duch_kazatel> we wound up just integrating from service "b" - if we couldn't nopthing.
[16:37:05] <duch_kazatel> same here.
[16:37:13] <duch_kazatel> i build whitelabeled solutions for newspaper ads.
[16:37:30] <duch_kazatel> our paying customer was the newspaper.  to ensure their success, we had to make the platform usable.
[16:37:37] <duch_kazatel> they were often wrong about how things should be done.
[16:37:43] <archfool> We want to send external, because we cannot control the data externally. We don't want to have to re-release each time external vendor changes their site
[16:37:57] <duch_kazatel> are you scraping this data?
[16:38:17] <archfool> nope.  Just tossing the end-user over the fence. That's what mgt told me. We have ZERO agreements with external data source.
[16:38:39] <duch_kazatel> then i'd tell the paying client "link it yourself" :)
[16:38:40] <archfool> so have no guarantees on data or formatting
[16:39:00] <duch_kazatel> because what you're doing is going to drive users away, which then makes your product look less and less useful.
[16:39:06] <archfool> They can't link it themselves. It's a dynamic page. Which is why we need to throw them under the bus... er, over the fence
[16:39:19] <archfool> I'm not disagreeing with you. ;)
[16:39:39] <duch_kazatel> lol
[16:39:55] <archfool> Since when did managers ever listen to devs?
[16:40:05] <duch_kazatel> at my current company.
[16:40:07] <duch_kazatel> at my last company...
[16:40:27] <duch_kazatel> but they have tendencies to trust the expertise of the people they hire.
[16:40:29] <initself> dammit can anyone see why the text isn't populating the qty box?
[16:40:30] <initself> http://jsfiddle.net/JbTFC/
[16:40:31] <archfool> This product is outdated and won't live another 2 years.  They just want to hammer the wheels back on when they fall off
[16:40:42] <duch_kazatel> what sort of industry are you in?
[16:40:45] <BillCriswell> Man, I feel like a crazy person today.
[16:41:37] <archfool> They're supposed to be rebuilding the product from ground up anyway
[16:41:48] <duch_kazatel> what sort of clients are these?
[16:42:07] <archfool> I'd rather not disclose our industry. Sorry.
[16:42:13] <duch_kazatel> okay.
[16:42:24] <duch_kazatel> hrm.
[16:42:30] <archfool> But we make websites for clients.  Their clients use the dynamic web sites we make
[16:42:41] <duch_kazatel> lol
[16:42:48] <duch_kazatel> sounds a lot like what I used to do.
[16:42:50] <duch_kazatel> interesting.
[16:42:58] <archfool> we never get a bug report from an end-user. Just clients. ;)
[16:43:13] <duch_kazatel> same here.
[16:43:35] <duch_kazatel> at a certain point, your clients will have to recognize that the platform is useless without users.
[16:43:58] <duch_kazatel> hence my confusion.
[16:44:26] <archfool> We sell this "data" service.  However, big and powerful customers have paid others to provide this "data".  They want their site to use their externally paid "data"
[16:44:38] <archfool> we have to provide.
[16:44:57] <archfool> But with no agreement with external data vendor, we're not going to scrape data and fit it into our paradigm.
[16:44:57] <duch_kazatel> this sounds suspiciously like an old competitor.
[16:45:09] <duch_kazatel> yeah, sounds about right.
[16:45:11] <archfool> of course the external data is a competitor. ;)
[16:45:38] <duch_kazatel> in a lot of cases, we used to tell the clients "Link it yourself - we're not sending our clients elsewhere - that makes no sense"
[16:45:43] <archfool> not directly, but effectively the same
[16:45:52] <duch_kazatel> still
[16:46:03] <duch_kazatel> sounds very similar to what i used to do.
[16:46:08] <archfool> in the mobile site, there's no place to "link it yourself".  Which is why I need a button that looks like a collapsible widget. ;)
[16:46:24] <duch_kazatel> by "link it yourself" it was that they needed to link it from their end.
[16:46:33] <duch_kazatel> we didn't give them a way to do it anywhere in our service.
[16:46:53] <archfool> The mobile version of the site is 100% generated content. No way to change it short of programatically.  Me.
[16:47:00] <initself> argh
[16:47:01] <initself> $('input[name="qty.1"]').text('1');
[16:47:05] <archfool> well, our product owner has told me to make it so.
[16:47:08] <archfool> =shurg=
[16:47:18] <initself> $('input[name="qty.1"]').text('1');
[16:47:18] <archfool> I think it's stupid, too.  But they're paying. =shurg=
[16:47:22] <initself> <input type="text" name="qty.1" />
[16:47:25] <initself> isn't that a good match?
[16:48:01] <BillCriswell> initself: Try to escape the period.
[16:48:51] <BillCriswell> initself: Actually... duh nevermind.
[16:48:52] <initself> qty\.1?
[16:48:54] <BillCriswell> Use .val()
[16:49:03] <initself> i tried val at one point
[16:49:05] * initself tries again.
[16:49:10] <BillCriswell> $('input[name="qty.1"]').val('foo'); worked for me
[16:49:30] <initself> there we go
[16:49:40] <initself> BillCriswell++ # sometimes it's the little things
[16:53:37] <BillCriswell> No problem.
[17:06:52] <barryhjames> Having an issue with .on('focus'). I have some jquery that removes a class when a field input receives focus. But if I fill out that field, remove focus and then give it focus again, it erases what I typed. I don't want that to happen. http://jsfiddle.net/A5TwL/
[17:08:28] <doug65536> barryhjames: you wipe it with $(this).val("");
[17:08:30] <goldr046> remvove line 5
[17:09:01] <mobile8>  i have a result, eg 1000000 and i would like to add comas into the results for both 4 and 7 digit figures? (ie. 1,000 pesos. 1,000,000 pesos)
[17:09:04] <mobile8> how can i best do this?
[17:09:19] <barryhjames> But when I go back to give that input focus a second time, the class has been removed, so why is it taking on that jquery at all?
[17:10:12] <Ernestonia> hello guys
[17:10:20] <doug65536> barryhjames: use hasClass and instead of wiping class attribute, use removeClass
[17:10:21] <Ernestonia> i have having an issue with jquery mobile
[17:10:23] <ringo_> @mobile8: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1990512/add-comma-to-numbers-every-three-digits-using-jquery
[17:11:07] <doug65536> barryhjames: your .error selector is only applied at the moment it attaches the focus handler
[17:11:17] <Ernestonia> http://jsfiddle.net/FjQXy/62/  <--- if you use the search filter first it works, but if you adjust the : rating slider or the service checkbox's the search filter input stops working, anyone pls?
[17:11:20] <doug65536> barryhjames: it doesn't keep reevaluating whether it has error class
[17:12:49] <ringo_> eval 'hello'
[17:12:53] <ringo_> oops
[17:12:58] <Ernestonia> when you touch of other input element the search element stops filtering the data :s
[17:13:27] <barryhjames> doug65536: Didn't work. Now it won't remove the value of the input at all. http://jsfiddle.net/A5TwL/2/
[17:13:57] <doug65536> barryhjames: one sec, almost have fiddle ready
[17:15:29] <doug65536> barryhjames: http://jsfiddle.net/A5TwL/6/
[17:16:42] <barryhjames> doug65536: Ah, nice work!  I see now. Should have used blur to counteract what was happening. Duh! :-) Thanks for your help!
[17:16:54] <doug65536> barryhjames: np
[17:19:09] <RNT> hi, i want to open this url into iframe/div using firefox, can somebody show me how pls?
[17:19:11] <RNT> http://www.webcaston.com/player/player.swf?&autostart=true&stretching=uniform&file=urfav05&streamer=rtmp://live.webcaston.com/wlb
[17:19:15] <RNT> thank you
[17:20:01] <doug65536> RNT: how many ads do I have to wait through?
[17:20:36] <doug65536> RNT: is it endless ads?
[17:20:41] <initself> do i have an unreasonable expectation that this is going to give me all my form input data?
[17:20:44] <initself> $('#premiums').submit(function() { console.log( $(this).serialize() ); });
[17:20:52] <initself> it returned an empty string
[17:21:17] <doug65536> initself: it will give you nothing for disabled inputs
[17:21:19] <RNT> what do you mean initself?
[17:21:32] <RNT> doug65536*
[17:21:46] <initself> the inputs in my form are real
[17:21:55] <doug65536> RNT: can you configure the server serving those ads?
[17:22:12] <RNT> what do you mean by ads?
[17:22:12] <initself> basically, i'm just trying something simple that says: hey, if this form is sumitted, give me some data I can pass to my ajax
[17:22:33] <doug65536> RNT: it showed 4 or 5 ads
[17:22:59] <initself> maybe i need .on?
[17:23:39] <RNT> doug65536, pls open this with Chrome and afterthat, wit Firefox:
[17:23:41] <RNT> http://jsfiddle.net/bnwWV/
[17:25:30] <duch_kazatel> There's no javascript or jquery on that fiddle.
[17:25:31] <doug65536> RNT: looking...
[17:25:48] <RNT> i know is no js...
[17:25:59] <duch_kazatel> then why are you asking for help in a channel for jquery?
[17:26:07] <doug65536> RNT: there is no need for semicolons in html tag
[17:26:12] <Ernestonia> anyone?
[17:26:26] <RNT> but i'm lookin for a way to open any url into iframe/div across browsers
[17:26:50] <duch_kazatel> RNT change the src attribute of the iframe - that should work.
[17:26:54] <initself> http://jsfiddle.net/brJut/ # empty string?  WHY!
[17:27:08] <RNT> duch_kazatel, how?
[17:28:00] <duch_kazatel> RNT - $(selectorHere).attr('src)
[17:28:06] <duch_kazatel> err
[17:28:16] <duch_kazatel> RNT - $(selectorHere).attr('src') = 'iframeUrlHere'
[17:28:17] <RNT> i tryed even so, same result
[17:28:21] <duch_kazatel> bam done.
[17:31:30] <duch_kazatel> RNT - sorry, it's  $(selectorHere).attr('src', 'iframeUrlHere');
[17:31:40] <duch_kazatel> note that some sites don't allow you to iframe them.
[17:31:55] <mitchdotpro> Hey guys, not sure this is a js/jquery question, but not sure where else to ask. I have a layout that includes a fixed header, but on Android when I focus an input it scrolls that input to the top of the screen and positions it under the header. Any ideas how I might fix that?
[17:32:34] <duch_kazatel> mitchdotpro - probably need to set some kind of offset.
[17:32:40] <RNT> duch_kazatel, i tried all possible js/jquery combinations, the problem is very basic, it won't load the url properly in Firefox and i  don't know why
[17:32:50] <RNT> or what else i can do :(
[17:33:00] <doug65536> it won't load on chrome either
[17:33:05] <mitchdotpro> duch_kazatel: Kinda figured that much, but does that mean wait for focus and scroll down programatically, or...?
[17:33:09] <RNT> in chrome is ok
[17:33:16] <doug65536> RNT: define ok
[17:33:23] <RNT> at least on my chrome
[17:33:29] <doug65536> RNT: if "no video plays" is ok, then sure, it's ok
[17:33:47] <RNT> is the ssame thing as you open that url directly in your browser
[17:33:51] <doug65536> here's what I have so far http://jsfiddle.net/bnwWV/6/
[17:34:19] <duch_kazatel> and mitchdotpro probably?  not sure how android does its focusing for that.
[17:35:02] <RNT> doug65536, that's fine in Chrome, but in Firefox?
[17:35:11] <shoky> initself: your div and your form have the same id
[17:35:13] <mitchdotpro> Yeah, fun huh? :-) Oh well, I'll keep playing.
[17:35:40] <doug65536> RNT: my fiddle works for you?
[17:35:55] <RNT> just in Chrome, doug65536
[17:36:05] <RNT> in FF won't
[17:36:20] <Ernestonia> hello ?
[17:36:25] <Ernestonia> Storage {favourites: "["0","4"]"}
[17:36:41] <Ernestonia> how do i remove either array value ?
[17:37:00] <Ernestonia> localStorage.removeItem(favourites[0]);  did not work
[17:37:20] <duch_kazatel> Ernestonia - jsfiddle?
[17:37:36] <Ernestonia> i will have to update my jsfiddle 1 sec
[17:37:43] <Less_Seen> maybe take the quotes off from around the array
[17:38:05] <duch_kazatel> ^^^
[17:38:11] <duch_kazatel> wanted to make sure that's not what you actually had.
[17:38:12] <Less_Seen> might cast it to a string that way ._.
[17:39:38] <doug65536> RNT: well it doesn't work in my chrome... still trying stuff
[17:39:44] <javalover> shoky you know the answer to thisone
[17:39:54] <duch_kazatel> actually, what they'd get is some invalid data structure - they'd get [ as a string, then 0 as an int, then , as a stringm, then 4 as an int, then ] as a string.
[17:39:56] <duch_kazatel> woah.
[17:40:02] <javalover> so I have very nice buttons designed in photoshop, but the font is like not available for everyone...
[17:40:09] <RNT> doug65536, thank you very much, i will be waiting for you
[17:40:10] <javalover> say I make the buttons images...is that efficient?
[17:40:30] <duch_kazatel> javalover images = extra overhead.
[17:40:36] <javalover> but the font....
[17:40:43] <javalover> like unavailable to all computers
[17:40:45] <duch_kazatel> choose a different font or use a webfont ;)
[17:40:50] <duch_kazatel> *web-safe font.
[17:40:58] <javalover> idk man lets see what shoky says
[17:41:01] <duch_kazatel> lmao
[17:41:05] <duch_kazatel> oh ok.
[17:41:20] <shoky> javalover: you can listen to others too
[17:41:25] <grafi> nah
[17:41:28] <javalover> but i wanna know if it's really overhead
[17:41:31] <grafi> only listen to shoky
[17:41:33] <javalover> it's like 3 images
[17:41:35] <duch_kazatel> it's an extra image to download.
[17:41:49] <duch_kazatel> what happens when a blind user uses your side with a screen reader?
[17:41:50] <shoky> javalover: then calculate how much data you're sending
[17:41:55] <duch_kazatel> (i actually don't know the answer to that one)
[17:41:57] <grafi> make an image map, see if its smaller than the webfont there you go
[17:41:58] <javalover> blind people use computers!?
[17:42:12] <duch_kazatel> Welcome to the internet.
[17:42:12] <doug65536> javalover: yes
[17:42:23] <javalover> well is it possible at all to use a font users don't have?
[17:42:27] <shoky> javalover: if your image is 200k that's almost 200k more overhead than just having it as text
[17:42:28] <duch_kazatel> webfonts.
[17:42:29] <javalover> i think that's the real question
[17:42:42] <duch_kazatel> http://www.google.com/fonts/
[17:42:47] <grafi> wohoo
[17:42:52] <javalover> i'm using garamond
[17:43:14] <doug65536> RNT: does this work for you http://jsfiddle.net/bnwWV/17/
[17:43:16] <javalover> what about 1 image with all 3 buttons
[17:43:17] <duch_kazatel> i see EB Garamound.
[17:43:22] <javalover> and then just a lookup
[17:43:29] <duch_kazatel> javalover - you're still adding in extra overhead.
[17:43:38] <javalover> yeah but it looks good
[17:43:40] <javalover> so it's worth it
[17:43:56] <duch_kazatel> lol
[17:44:16] <RNT> doug65536, again, just in Chrome
[17:44:29] <javalover> duch nobody wants to use a computer with only dos on it
[17:44:37] <Lui_> How would one detect and idle user on lets say an iPad when it goes into suspended mode(eg Home button is pressed)?
[17:44:38] <javalover> not after they've seen windows HELLO
[17:44:48] <grafi> javalover is a mac user
[17:44:56] <duch_kazatel> not that's all I'm defending, but go ahead and unnecessarily add page weight because it "looks good"
[17:44:57] <javalover> no i'm an xp user
[17:45:01] <grafi> xp oô
[17:45:05] <grafi> welcome to 2002?
[17:45:12] <duch_kazatel> and with that, bye friendos.
[17:45:18] <grafi> bye duch_kazatel
[17:45:24] <javalover> i'd love to upgrade but i also still love xp
[17:45:35] <grafi> upgrade to win7
[17:45:35] <duch_kazatel> and javalover - as somebody who loved XP, 7 is fantastic.
[17:45:36] <javalover> it's a conflict
[17:45:37] <grafi> be happy
[17:45:37] <duch_kazatel> switch.
[17:45:46] <grafi> switch
[17:45:47] <grafi> really
[17:45:47] <javalover> the thing is, the upgrade changes so much
[17:45:49] <javalover> it's hard to work with
[17:45:54] <nesoi> how would I define a scrolling region and make the first element appear at the bottom rather than the top?
[17:45:56] <grafi> not really
[17:46:12] <javalover> you have to understand I have a very specific coding environment
[17:46:19] <javalover> to change before finishing my project can be disastrous
[17:46:38] <javalover> the installs alone would set me back about a week
[17:46:45] <grafi> oO
[17:46:54] <grafi> what are you doing?
[17:47:02] <javalover> *shhh* it's a secret
[17:47:03] <shoky> buttons
[17:47:04] <javalover> no i'm kidding
[17:47:12] <doug65536> RNT: what happens if you go to http://www.webcaston.com/player/player.swf?skin=http://www.webcaston.com/player/skins/stormtrooper/stormtrooper.zip&controlbar=over&dock=false&autostart=true&stretching=uniform&file=urfav05&streamer=rtmp://live.webcaston.com/wlb"
[17:47:14] <javalover> but I code for mobile & web & also 3d games etc.
[17:47:22] <javalover> it's a lot of installing just to get a new computer going
[17:47:22] <grafi> well whats the setup
[17:47:23] <grafi> oô
[17:47:31] <doug65536> RNT: nevermind, " at end
[17:47:33] <javalover> I also use turtoise etc.
[17:47:39] <grafi> so?
[17:47:40] <javalover> i have build paths etc.
[17:47:46] <grafi> its still windows
[17:47:56] <javalover> ur saying if I upgrade it'll stay the same?
[17:48:01] <javalover> even though everything is set for xp?
[17:48:08] <grafi> its windows?
[17:48:14] <javalover> i don't believe you at all
[17:48:21] <grafi> well
[17:48:23] <javalover> too many people have had issues when upgrading
[17:48:25] <grafi> dont
[17:48:27] <javalover> even with just running a game
[17:48:28] <nesoi> anyone have a hint?
[17:48:29] <nesoi> how would I define a scrolling region and make the first element appear at the bottom rather than the top?
[17:48:39] <grafi> no idea nesoi
[17:48:44] <javalover> but I will buy a new computer and use the new windows
[17:48:50] <grafi> dont use win8
[17:48:52] <javalover> just after I have earned my money is all
[17:48:53] <grafi> its horrible ^^
[17:48:57] <nesoi> thanks grafi… anyone else have an idea?
[17:48:58] <arkore> nesoi, google "absolute footer"
[17:49:18] <nesoi> arkore:  I don't want it in the footer. I want a scrolling region where the elements appear from the bottom rather than the top
[17:49:39] <grafi> whats a scrolling region
[17:49:40] <grafi> ^^
[17:49:43] <arkore> and for scrolling region, just do { height: 200px; overflow: scroll; }
[17:49:52] <arkore> you want the scrollbar to start at 100%, and people scroll upwards?
[17:49:59] <doug65536> RNT: what you are attempting is cross site iframe. what I don't understand is why it works for you and not for me in chrome
[17:50:29] <nesoi> arkore:  I want the scrolling region to start empty but with items added from the bottom. This is for a messaging app
[17:51:08] <RNT> doug65536, private pls
[17:51:09] <arkore> nesoi, just append elements to the scrolling box then, and each append do scrolldown to 100%
[17:51:12] <Ernestonia> i cant even get this blood thing onto jsfiddle
[17:51:17] <Ernestonia> something gone wrong again :(
[17:52:09] <nesoi> arkore: the first entry will still be at the top rather than the bottom of the region, no?
[17:52:55] <shoky> Ernestonia: var favs = JSON.parse( localStorage.getItem('favourites') );  favs.splice(1, 1); localStorage.setItem('favourites', JSON.stringify(favs));
[17:53:21] <Ernestonia> so splice instead of removeItem ?
[17:53:31] <nesoi> the issue is that this is for mobile, so when the textbox is selected, the soft keyboard appears and everything scrolls up. So if the most recent message isn't at the bottom, just above the soft keyboard, it will be hidden
[17:53:35] <shoky> removeItem is to remove an item from localstorage, not for removing items from an array
[17:53:47] <shoky> Ernestonia: localStorage contains only strings, not arrays
[17:53:52] <Ernestonia> jesus christ
[17:54:00] <Ernestonia> no bloody wonder
[17:54:03] <Ernestonia> thanx
[17:54:10] <arkore> nesoi, well, your scrolling area must have a child wrapper area, with padding-top set to same height as the scrolling area, and decrease that padding as the area fills up.
[17:54:28] <arkore> or decrease on event "onresize" of the scrolling area
[17:54:37] <nesoi> arkore:  that's clever, but sounds hard to implement
[17:55:07] <arkore> nesoi, what you're asking for is hard
[17:55:28] <arkore> it's unnatural.  irregular flow of web rendering.
[17:55:44] <nesoi> arkore:  someone in #css just linked me to this http://flexiejs.com/playground/
[17:56:08] <shoky> why not.. add the elements in reverse order?
[17:56:13] <nesoi> https://www.evernote.com/shard/s236/sh/25264cda-1542-48cf-86da-26b85cc61264/74b1bdf17d336a4e52f62eb009b6bafb
[17:57:32] <arkore> nesoi, well, i thought you want this to work for IE browsers
[17:57:43] <nesoi> it's for android phones!
[17:57:51] <arkore> i didnt know webkit has such funky features like box-direction: reverse;  and box-pack: end;  lulz
[17:58:05] <arkore> i was giving you a CSS 1 / JS solution/hack.  ;)
[17:58:50] <nesoi> thanks arkore, your solution is more general I believe
[18:02:53] <Ernestonia> i think i will get this favourite storage thing working offline before i can get the broken example on jsfiddle, what a mess
[18:05:12] <Woosta> Hi .. jqueryui .. I downloaded a zip file and it has a bajillion useless things in it. Which do I need in order to actually USE jqueryui?
[18:05:32] <Woosta> THere's no README or INSTALL or anything else that looks like it explains what bits I need
[18:10:10] <arkore> nesoi, yup
[18:10:35] <arkore> Woosta, you downloaded a theme from http://jqueryui.com/themeroller/ ?
[18:11:17] <Woosta> no, I downloaded from http://jqueryui.com/download/
[18:13:57] <guzzlefry> Is it possible to detect a form submission in an iframe?
[18:19:59] <Tomashe> Hey guys i have a checkbox with that name: name="checkbox[]" and i want to run each loop only on the "checked" ones
[18:20:01] <Tomashe> how do i do it
[18:20:21] <guzzlefry> There's a selector for that stuff iirc.
[18:20:41] <Tomashe> yes , but i find it hard to find whats the best method to use in that case
[18:21:01] <ipwa> hey guys I have a carousel with a nested carousel that's working well: http://jsfiddle.net/PEFWc/4/  - however I'd like for when you click one of the headers and the content is open for it to close it, any advice?
[18:21:02] <Tomashe> so consulting with the professionals
[18:21:50] <ipwa> I meant accordion instead of carousel, sorry guys
[18:39:38] <nesoi> hmm… so that box method isn't working. I'm trying it on a jquery mobile listview…. any idea what I would have to do to get that box css to apply so that the listview can start from the bottom?
[19:07:14] <doug65536> there's your problem
[19:07:45] <doug65536> oops wrong chat
[19:32:39] <Ernestonia> hi
[19:33:19] <RRR2> hi
[19:33:23] <Ernestonia> does anyone have any idea why:  $.mobile.changePage("#favourites");  is not changing from the #favourites page
[19:33:36] <Ernestonia> i am trying to reload a page with listview('refresh')
[19:33:54] <Ernestonia> changePage and listview refresh are not working
[19:34:59] <arschmitz> Ernestonia: both of those calls seem fine so it must be something else going on
[19:35:23] <arschmitz> Ernestonia: also just so your aware $.mobile.changePage is deprecated in 1.4
[19:35:55] <Ernestonia> oky i wont use that then :)
[19:36:58] <arschmitz> Ernestonia: if your working on 1.3.x right now there is no alternative
[19:37:04] <arschmitz> the replacment is also new in 1.4
[19:40:11] <Ernestonia> this is where am upto so far:
[19:40:13] <Ernestonia> http://jsfiddle.net/FjQXy/86/
[19:40:24] <Ernestonia> if you goto: top ten, click a list item
[19:40:37] <Ernestonia> then in the top right corner is a add to fav button, once clicked it takes you to favourites page
[19:40:44] <Ernestonia> and from there it goes to shit
[19:40:59] <Ernestonia> i cant exit the page, i can not delete the item or refresh the page
[20:00:12] <Ernestonia> http://jsfiddle.net/FjQXy/86/
[20:00:16] <Ernestonia> what am i doing wrong here?
[20:00:27] <RRR2> >86!
[20:00:29] <RRR2> WOW
[20:00:31] <Ernestonia> lol
[20:00:43] <Ernestonia> i bookmarked it :p
[20:00:50] <Ernestonia> and carried on of a few days
[20:01:16] <Ernestonia> am not so good at this
[20:01:24] <Ernestonia> as numbers tell
[20:01:43] <RRR2> Alright so what are you trying to do?
[20:01:53] <Ernestonia> add a favourite and remove it
[20:02:00] <Ernestonia> currently a favourite can be added
[20:02:20] <Ernestonia> via: Top ten - li - top left corner button adds fav
[20:02:27] <Ernestonia> then redirects to favourites
[20:02:32] <Ernestonia> which is great
[20:02:38] <Ernestonia> but from here it freezes
[20:02:51] <RRR2> Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'shops' of undefined
[20:02:57] <RRR2> try using the console
[20:03:09] <Ernestonia> i hate safari
[20:03:13] <RRR2> f12
[20:03:23] <RRR2> >console
[20:03:37] <Ernestonia> no console came up
[20:03:41] <RRR2> Oh
[20:03:50] <Ernestonia> am on a mac :s
[20:04:06] <RRR2> DW
[20:04:07] <Ernestonia> going to open chrome
[20:05:09] <Ernestonia> am getting a scrollto error :S
[20:05:11] <RRR2> http://developer.apple.com/library/safari/documentation/appleapplications/Conceptual/Safari_Developer_Guide/1Introduction/Introduction.html
[20:05:22] <RRR2> Safari Dev tools are almost like chrome dev tools
[20:05:31] <Ernestonia> i got the chrome open now :0
[20:05:32] <Ernestonia> :0
[20:05:35] <Ernestonia>  saved time :)
[20:05:53] <Ernestonia> in chrome v.86 does not even load
[20:06:03] <Ernestonia> and i get a property 'scrolTo' error
[20:06:06] <Ernestonia> not the one you got:s
[20:06:23] <RRR2> Oh
[20:06:29] <RRR2> Sorry I had cookies disabled
[20:06:33] <RRR2> I always disable them
[20:06:35] <RRR2> Hehe
[20:07:26] <Ernestonia> i have made a mess
[20:07:32] <Ernestonia> my json is at the bottom
[20:07:38] <Ernestonia> and below that is more code
[20:07:49] <Ernestonia> i cant select in chrome for some reason :s
[20:08:02] <Ernestonia> so icant cut + paste in chrome
[20:09:57] <Ernestonia> ok try this one :
[20:09:57] <Ernestonia> $('#favourites').on('pageinit', function() {
[20:09:57] <Ernestonia> 	$('#favList').listview('refresh');
[20:09:57] <Ernestonia> 	$('#favList li').click(function() {
[20:09:57] <Ernestonia> 		numItem = $(this).index();
[20:09:58] <Ernestonia> 		currentItem = favourites[numItem];
[20:09:58] <Ernestonia> 	});
[20:09:59] <Ernestonia> 	
[20:09:59] <Ernestonia> $(".delurl").click(function (e) {
[20:10:00] <Ernestonia>   		var value = $(".shopid").text();
[20:10:00] <Ernestonia> 		
[20:10:01] <Ernestonia>        //	delUrl(value);
[20:10:01] <Ernestonia> 	$.mobile.changePage("#favourites");
[20:10:02] <Ernestonia> 	return false;		
[20:10:10] <RRR2> Dude
[20:10:14] <RRR2> Don't do that
[20:10:18] <RRR2> You'll get booted
[20:10:19] <Ernestonia> didnt mean to
[20:10:22] <Ernestonia> its this mac
[20:10:31] <Ernestonia> you use cmd c in the browser
[20:10:37] <Ernestonia> but ctrl c in this irc client
[20:10:56] <RRR2> Just.. use pastebin for those things
[20:11:04] <Ernestonia> it was a accident
[20:11:10] <RRR2> I know
[20:11:13] <Ernestonia> i tried to copy the url but it failed
[20:11:15] <Ernestonia> http://jsfiddle.net/FjQXy/89/
[20:11:20] <RRR2> but they usually don't forgive
[20:11:21] <Ernestonia> that is what i intended
[20:11:36] <Ernestonia> i have a legit reason, am not being a bastard on purpose
[20:11:48] <Ernestonia> :b
[20:12:05] <Ernestonia> add a shop to favourites
[20:12:09] <Ernestonia> and watch
[20:12:50] <RRR2> It doesn't go back to the menu?
[20:13:26] <Ernestonia> a) doesnt go back
[20:13:30] <Ernestonia> b) you can not delete
[20:13:47] <RRR2> Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'shopName' of undefined
[20:13:52] <RRR2> Try fixing that maybe
[20:14:13] <RRR2> This context ->   $(this).find('[data-role=header] .ui-title').text(json.shops[currentItem].shopName);
[20:14:20] <Ernestonia> why am i not getting that error :s
[20:14:26] <RRR2> No Idea
[20:14:37] <RRR2> always have the console open
[20:14:57] <RRR2> and use http://jsfiddle.net/FjQXy/86/show/ may be suited sometimes for debugging
[20:16:32] <Ernestonia> wow i never knew that
[20:16:33] <Ernestonia> thx
[20:17:37] <Ernestonia> what page do you get that error on?
[20:18:20] <RRR2> I already linked you the context
[20:18:28] <RRR2> What page, hmm
[20:18:47] <Ernestonia> i still do not get that error :s
[20:18:48] <RRR2> I clicked on the + was redirected to favourites, tried to go back, ERROR
[20:19:08] <Ernestonia> arr
[20:19:09] <Ernestonia> yeah
[20:19:11] <Ernestonia> i see it now
[20:19:27] <Ernestonia> this is because the back from favourites is to #coffeeshop  and not the menu
[20:19:40] <Ernestonia> but even without clicking the back button you can not delete the item
[20:20:09] <Ernestonia> try again but click the X
[20:20:50] <RRR2> Does nothing I guess
[20:20:55] <RRR2> try fixing that error anyway
[20:21:15] <RRR2> I actually haven't read the code is probably too long for me to even try.
[20:21:52] <Ernestonia> if i press Reload page in browser the item actually does delete
[20:22:02] <Ernestonia> but the page/ listview is not refreshing
[20:27:02] <doug65536> Ernestonia, RRR2 the /show/ link is good for putting a fiddle through the w3c html and css validators too
[20:37:58] <RayHerring> i have an object (row) which points to a <tr> in a table, using that object, how would i get the <td> that has a specific class?
[20:41:33] <RayHerring> n/m worked it out
[20:46:40] <Ernestonia> i am trying something else instead now
[20:49:37] <nathanbz> does anyone have a good way to display a popup saying you are using an old browser ?
[20:49:46] <nathanbz> I'm guess it would be best to have a non-js solution
[20:52:37] <kborchers> nathanbz: depends on your definition of an old browser but this might be a good first step https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate/blob/master/index.html#L20-L22
[20:53:34] <nathanbz> ie 6 and 7
[20:53:42] <Whirl3d> can you set the css left position of an element that has display:none?
[21:18:44] <BeardlessOne__> hi!
[21:18:52] <BeardlessOne__> hi!
[21:39:23] <whitenoise> ..hi
[22:16:30] <sammych> colours! http://pastebin.com/kn3VDFp5
[22:23:00] <nesoi> any jqm people here?
[23:25:27] <doug65536> nesoi: just ask
[23:26:48] <nesoi> hi doug65536
[23:27:00] <doug65536> nesoi: hi
[23:27:31] <nesoi> so I'm trying to write a messaging app using phonegap and jqm, and I want the messages to appear in a reverse scrolling area with the first message and ever subsequent message on the bottom of the area
[23:28:10] <nesoi> so it's like: fixed header: scrolling message listview, textarea: fixed footer
[23:29:12] <nesoi> I'm using jquery scrollz for lazy loading and modified it so it will load in reverse, and I was trying to use this css to make messages load from the bottom (works in chrome) http://dabblet.com/gist/6190393
[23:29:23] <nesoi> but that style doesn't seem to do anything when I apply it to the listview
[23:30:00] <nesoi> so I'm wondring how to get that loading from the bottom to work
[23:30:50] <nesoi> what do you think doug65536?
[23:35:24] <doug65536> nesoi: how would it be lazy loading though? where the li's coming from
[23:35:52] <nesoi> doug65536 : I'm just doing prepends inside the ul element
[23:36:20] <doug65536> wouldn't prepend put it (visually) at the bottom?
[23:36:22] <nesoi> the lazy loading is just that jquery scrollz tells you when you're near the bottom or top and you load a bunch more into the listview in the background
[23:36:32] <nesoi> append puts it at the bottom
[23:36:36] <nesoi> prepend puts it at the top
[23:36:47] <doug65536> nesoi: yes normally, of course
[23:36:59] <doug65536> but you have the box direction vertically reversed
[23:37:26] <doug65536> hard question :)
[23:37:30] <nesoi> I don't think so
[23:37:33] <doug65536> almost a puzzle
[23:37:39] <nesoi> prepend still adds to the top. I see that happening
[23:37:52] <nesoi> the goal is just to make the first item appear at the bottom of the scrolling area
[23:38:00] <nesoi> on the screen
[23:38:03] <nesoi> rather than at the top
[23:39:18] <doug65536> nesoi: until just now, I didn't even know box-direction even existed :)
[23:39:29] <doug65536> never seen it used
[23:39:45] <nesoi> ok, but given that it exists, why isn't it working when applied to a listview, or how could I get it to work?
[23:41:04] <doug65536> nesoi: I'll try to recreate it...
[23:41:09] <nesoi> thanks!
[23:41:31] <nesoi> you see the need for it, right? for creating something that works like a standard sms or messaging app
[23:42:42] <doug65536> I'm not sure I see a need for the newest line at the top - which chat app works like that?
[23:46:05] <nesoi> doug65536 : the newest line needs to be at the bottom of the screen, right above the textarea. The reason for this is that when you tap the textarea and the soft keyboard pops up, the entire screen scrolls up by the height of the soft keyboard. If the message was not right above the textarea it would go off the screen.
[23:46:27] <nesoi> just look at any messaging app like viber, line, default sms apps, etc.
[23:47:12] <doug65536> yes that makes sense. then why is the li order reversed?
[23:47:28] <doug65536> so when it gets smaller it "pushes up" the newest line?
[23:48:40] <nesoi> I guess I wasn't clear. messages should be in order of most recent at the bottom (end of the listview) with the listview always at the bottom by default. That I have working. The problem is that the first message needs to be at the bottom of the listview area on the screen, so that it's right above the textarea.
[23:49:25] <nesoi> so as the listview gets filled, the 1st entry is on the bottom of the screen, above the textarea, the second one is right above that, etc.
[23:51:24] <doug65536> nesoi: ok, makes sense, they are visually reversed, and you lazily load them in reverse too (latest message first)
[23:51:44] <nesoi> right!
[23:52:12] <nesoi> but so far I can't get that to work :(
[23:56:30] <doug65536> nesoi: is this as expected? http://jsfiddle.net/gaEzu/1/
[23:56:40] <doug65536> try vertically resizing the bottom right pane
[23:56:53] <doug65536> if you make it too small it pushes whole thing down!
[23:57:11] <nesoi> yes, that's what I'm looking for
[23:57:25] <nesoi> not the hotpink though :)
[23:58:05] <nesoi> oh yeah, that's weird. hopefully I can control that by sizing it correctly
[23:58:32] <doug65536> this is better but not right still http://jsfiddle.net/gaEzu/2/
[23:59:00] <doug65536> better still, but not what you want http://jsfiddle.net/gaEzu/3/
[23:59:06] <nesoi> yes, it is
[23:59:44] <doug65536> I thought it isn't what you want because it pushes them *down* if pane is too small
[23:59:54] <nesoi> hm. but it has a scrollbar no matter how big I make it.
[23:59:55] <doug65536> wouldn't you want to preserve the visibility of the bottom thing?
