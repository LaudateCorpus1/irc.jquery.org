[16:56:27] <inthl> assuming I have a form that is being submitted and converted into an object by foobar = new FormData(this); ...how could one append additional form elements from another form? if I use foo = $(this).serialize(); then I can do that by appending it using foo += '&' + $('some_selector').serialize();
[16:56:45] <inthl> so how to append some_selector to foobar = new FormData(this); ?
[16:57:40] <inthl> that some_selector is actually a <form> with lots of elements
