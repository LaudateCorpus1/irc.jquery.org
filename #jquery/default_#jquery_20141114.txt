[00:06:06] <sgnl> Cork I would like to see a list of examples of what html attributes I can use as keys and the data types they accept. I wouldnt know by looking at the docs that style prop takes an hash of css properties and values.
[00:06:46] <Cork> sgnl: $('', {}) is a short hand
[00:07:08] <Cork> you can use $('').css().html().addClass() if you want things to be clearer
[00:07:19] <Cork> as that is what $('', {}) does internally
[00:08:41] <sgnl> yeah. I use it and know what it does but I wanted to find a visual rep of it for some people I'm teaching jQuery too. Thanks for saying "short-hand", that's exactly what it is and It'll help me explain it in that way.
[00:21:09] <caraconan> Hi there. I'm using JQueryMobile and cordova, but I think is pure javascript thing. I'm getting this error http://paste.debian.net/131719/, but testing function default values http://jsfiddle.net/wpucr17o/ apparently should work. Does or does not javascript support default values for function parameters? Thanks
[01:53:20] <Silmarilion> Does anybody know how can I use black icon set in jquery mobile instead of white?
[02:18:12] <d0de> I know absolutely nothing about software testing. Can anyone recommend a good place to start?
[02:19:50] <Erwat> in javascript?
[02:20:34] <d0de> yeah
[02:21:05] <d0de> ideally using something like Jasmine, but I know literally nothing about automated tests or unit tests
[02:21:39] <Erwat> me neither
[02:21:42] <d0de> or Karma
[02:21:44] <Erwat> i can help you set it up with karma though
[02:21:51] <Erwat> karma is the thing that runs tests
[02:21:55] <Erwat> jasmine is the way to describe tests
[02:21:57] <Erwat> so you'd be using both
[02:22:06] <d0de> ah, well that's good to know :)
[02:22:22] <d0de> are tests particular to a testing framework?
[02:22:31] <Erwat> jasmine is your testing framework
[02:22:37] <d0de> OK
[02:22:40] <Erwat> if you install via npm then remember to do
[02:22:47] <Erwat> npm install karma-jasmine@2.0
[02:22:53] <Erwat> to get the 2.0 version of jasmine
[02:23:39] <Erwat> sorry i meant npm install karma-jasmine@2_0
[02:23:57] <Erwat> i'm using karma, karma-jasmine@2_0, karma-requirejs, karma-cli and then karma launchers eg karma-chrome-launcher
[02:24:41] <Erwat> the idea is that when you run karma it'll host a server on your local machine, you can then connect a browser to it by going to that url (or karma automatically starts if you have the launchers installed) and when changes happen then the tests are run
[02:25:01] <d0de> I see
[02:25:05] <Erwat> this way you can go to the url with your phone too and it'll run the tests on your phone's browser
[02:25:15] <Erwat> and if you have karma-cli installed it'll show the results in your CLI
[02:25:23] <d0de> so you point karma at a particular directory and it watches for changes?
[02:25:36] <Erwat> yes you need to set up a configuration file
[02:25:53] <Erwat> where you describe what it has to watch
[02:27:02] <d0de> kk. And software tests are things you write as you write code that test each unit of code produces valid output for given dummy inputs?
[02:29:07] <Erwat> well those are unit tests
[02:29:24] <BarnaSzalai> hi
[02:29:27] <Erwat> where you essentially (usually) test functions and whether they give the right outputs, you can also see what they call and similar through spies
[02:29:43] <Erwat> d0de: but you can also do tests which try to make the application go through steps
[02:31:30] <d0de> so a comprehensive set of tests would usually consist of both (unit tests) and (tests that test multiple sections of code to simulate steps of user behavior) ?
[02:31:55] <BarnaSzalai> i have a clickable div and inside that an checkbox. how can I make the checkbox selected? I have the following code part:
[02:32:08] <BarnaSzalai> http://pastebin.com/SafDeX4d
[02:32:14] <BarnaSzalai> that doesnt do anything
[02:32:42] <BarnaSzalai> what it makes currently blinks a little but the checkbox isnt selected
[02:33:32] <d0de> BarnaSzalai, can you make jsfiddle?
[02:35:06] <BarnaSzalai> I'll try to make one
[02:38:30] <d0de> BarnaSzalai, if the div is clickable and not the input itself, aren't you targetting the wrong thing?
[02:39:09] <BarnaSzalai> i get correct e.target
[02:39:16] <BarnaSzalai> i mean the input
[02:39:46] <BarnaSzalai> maybe I cant use e.target for adding an attribute ?
[02:39:50] <BarnaSzalai> with jq
[02:41:28] <BarnaSzalai> d0de: is it engouh to select jquery from dropdown at jsfiddle?
[02:41:45] <d0de> BarnaSzalai, yes
[02:42:15] <BarnaSzalai> http://jsfiddle.net/no3thh0f/
[02:42:23] <BarnaSzalai> jquery doesnt running i guess
[02:47:19] <BarnaSzalai> d0de: strange: it gets checked, but the pipe doenst appear inside the box
[02:47:22] <BarnaSzalai> neves see that
[02:48:02] <BarnaSzalai> never
[02:52:00] <d0de> BarnaSzalai, this is what I would do: http://jsfiddle.net/no3thh0f/2/
[02:52:11] <d0de> click anywhere on the div, the checkbox gets checked
[02:53:54] <BarnaSzalai> d0de: but the clicking on div brings to other page in my case
[02:54:13] <d0de> BarnaSzalai, I don't understand what you mean
[02:55:05] <BarnaSzalai> the long div in my example, kind of loads a subpage
[02:55:29] <d0de> what's the problem with the approach I suggested? you can use e.target if you like
[02:55:30] <BarnaSzalai> clicking on the checkbox shouldnt load that page only make the checkbox active
[02:55:50] <BarnaSzalai> no prob, ill try prop()
[02:56:46] <d0de> http://jsfiddle.net/no3thh0f/6/ ?
[03:12:25] <Erwat> i don't understand how this works
[03:12:37] <Erwat> i have an array of "slides"
[03:12:57] <Erwat> i can do slides.hasClass("hide"); and it will return a boolean whether any of the slides have the class "hide" on it.
[03:13:08] <Erwat> i can't do slides[0].hasClass("hides")
[03:13:20] <Erwat> but i can do slides[0].className and it will return the name of the class - what gives?
[03:19:39] <d0de> how do you build the array?
[03:24:49] <Erwat> d0de: i don't really know how it's built, but somebody managed to help me. slides was a jquery object and i could find the right index with .eq
[03:28:22] <d0de> Erwat, glad you could figure it out, I suspected it might be something to do with that, on the basis that $('#foo')[0] returns the raw html. Haven't used .eq before, very interesting!
[03:29:06] <Erwat> d0de: i didn't know that .hasClass was jquery
[03:30:05] <Erwat> so instead of doing $('.foo')[0] you could do $('.foo').eq(0) and it would give you a jquery object but only the first one in the array
[03:30:37] <d0de> that's useful to know
[04:55:44] <d0de> if you're writing a system to process a given set of movement commands, but you're told "we may need different commands in future, keep that in mind", do you think it's a reasonable approach to pass the system a configuration object that has a "commands" object in it, and each movement function is an entry in the commands object?
[05:32:31] <revolve> Can anyone help me replace an original div after its been populated with search results?
[05:33:26] <revolve> it's a list of urls, and they're replaced with search results in realtime, but I want the results to be replaced with the original list if the search bar is cleared
[05:38:24] <Cork> revolve: you would have to cache the original elements
[05:38:29] <Cork> else the data gets lost
[05:38:41] <revolve> that's exactly what it's doing you're right
[05:39:06] <revolve> so, the current copy replaces the original list for as many characters you search for
[05:39:26] <revolve> so if you search for "test" you get four of the same list once you clear the search bar
[05:39:43] <Mia> is it possible to updae a desktop notification, instead of recreating a new one?
[05:39:59] <Mia> ##javascript doens't seem to be answering, so asking here.
[05:41:56] <revolve> cork would you mind if i pm you th elink?
[05:45:35] <HamburglarBurgla> Mia what kind of desktop notification ?
[05:45:46] <Mia> the notification api
[05:45:52] <Mia> web notifications for desktop
[05:48:01] <Mia> HamburglarBurgla,
[05:48:58] <HamburglarBurgla> Ah. Default web notifications. Well if it's instance based you can address that instance of the notification and I wouldn't see why you can't update the content. Haven't really used them before so I'm afraid I can't be a lot of help.
[05:51:22] <greek> Hi all. I'm using .html() to copy the contents of a div with a bunch of input fields in it. The values of the input fields aren't being copied however. So for example <select> menus and input text fields are returning with the first option selected and a blank text field.
[05:54:19] <revolve> Cork: what's the best way to cache the dom so it's not a live reference?
[05:54:45] <Cork> revolve: just select the elements and hold on to the result
[05:54:52] <mooncup> greek: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17919545/jquery-clone-div-with-form-elements-including-their-values
[05:54:57] <Cork> var cache = $('.elements.to-cache')
[05:55:05] <revolve> currently using  var urls = $(".urls").html()
[05:55:05] <mooncup> use clone/replaceall instead of html
[05:55:21] <greek> mooncup thanks
[05:55:33] <greek> mooncup - my wife uses one of those
[05:55:37] <revolve> and then if the search box is empty: $('.urls').empty(); $('.urls').html(urls);
[05:55:51] <revolve> now that works, but it works the amount of characters you've been searching for
[06:00:49] <HamburglarBurgla> Mia I just read the documentation on the api and you can address the notification using the given tag.
[06:01:01] <HamburglarBurgla> https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/API/notification
[06:01:32] <HamburglarBurgla> Mia Look for the options parameters specifically.
[06:02:12] <Cork> Mia: no you can't update a notification
[06:02:27] <Cork> the only interaction you can have with it is to dismiss it
[06:02:32] <HamburglarBurgla> Yeah I just read further. It's a read only property.
[06:02:35] <Cork> (or react on user interactions)
[06:02:49] <Cork> i've used it a lot :)
[06:03:11] <Cork> and some implementations doens't even support the interaction options
[06:04:06] <Mia> Cork, I obviously can't dismiss it upon creation
[06:04:12] <Mia> it takes time to create (around a second)
[06:04:18] <Mia> nd during that "popping up" time I can't destroy it
[06:04:40] <Mia> This is all for a messaging webapp, so notifications kind of become annoying if they pop one after another.
[06:04:43] <Cork> Mia: what is it you're trying to do?
[06:04:56] <Cork> ah
[06:05:00] <Mia> Cork, I want to notify the user that new message(s) arrived without irritating.
[06:05:09] <Mia> and I need to display the new message content there in the notification
[06:05:35] <Mia> displaying is not the real issue, actually the main issue is destroying it.
[06:05:44] <Mia> There is no auto close timer built in to the notifications
[06:05:57] <Mia> I build mine, but it's still irritating -
[06:06:09] <Mia> I mean, looking for guidance at this point.... "what would be more clever"
[06:06:13] <Cork> Mia: you can call .close on the old notification
[06:06:22] <Mia> Cork, actually no I cant
[06:06:27] <Cork> why not?
[06:06:41] <Mia> assume that someone messaged two times, in a second. You know people message like that sometimes. each word a line
[06:06:52] <Cork> sure
[06:06:55] <Mia> upon the creatioın of first notification, I don't have access to .close it
[06:07:04] <Mia> it's like.... blocked
[06:07:17] <Mia> it takes a second to create (pop up visually) the message for the browser
[06:07:25] <Cork> Mia: bind an onclose even on the notifications
[06:07:26] <Mia> and during that "popping up" phase you an't close it
[06:07:44] <Cork> store the "current" notification as you show it
[06:07:54] <Cork> when the onclose fires remove the reference
[06:08:03] <Cork> if the reference exist call .close on it before you show the new one
[06:08:08] <Cork> that is the best you can do
[06:08:19] <Mia> yes but then it takes a lot of time to doisplay a conversation
[06:08:29] <Cork> not really
[06:08:30] <Mia> I mean if the person spammed like mad, the notifications will stay there, like forever.
[06:08:42] <Cork> doesn't take longer then if you show them all at once
[06:08:51] <Cork> you just remove the old notification before you show the new one
[06:09:18] <Mia> no if you show them all at once, they just appear all at once
[06:09:29] <Cork> sure
[06:09:34] <Cork> and if you close the old one
[06:09:35] <Mia> if you show them one after anoter, you need to wait fo the popup thing to happen
[06:09:39] <Cork> it doesn't put a delay on the new one
[06:09:52] <Mia> the problem here is, you can't close it when it's happening
[06:09:54] <Mia> just try it -
[06:09:55] <Cork> i never said you had to do it after eachother
[06:09:57] <Cork> i have
[06:10:03] <Cork> like i said, i use it a lot
[06:10:15] <Mia> Hm can you send me an example please
[06:10:21] <Mia> maybe I am missing something
[06:10:43] <Cork> i can't right now, i have a meanting to get to
[06:10:51] <Mia> oh okay -
[06:10:52] <Cork> i could give you some help in a few hours though
[06:10:59] <Mia> Ok thanks, I would love to
[06:37:40] <Mia> is there a quick way to do a foreach to an array
[06:38:17] <BillCriswell> Mia: .forEach
[06:38:37] <Mia> BillCriswell, I came across that but I'm not sure what callback is?
[06:38:48] <Mia> I mean I didn2t get the structure of it
[06:38:51] <Cork> Mia: same as for $.each
[06:38:51] <Mia> (new to js here :) )
[06:39:01] <Cork> ?g api.jquery jquery.each
[06:39:02] <b-ot> Cork: .each() | jQuery API Documentation → http://api.jquery.com/each/
[06:39:07] <Cork> ...
[06:39:07] <BillCriswell> items.forEach(function(item){ /* Do what youw ant with item */ });
[06:39:34] <Cork> note though .forEach has cross browser limitations
[06:39:49] <Cork> http://api.jquery.com/jquery.each/
[06:39:56] <Mia> hmm so jquery's each is better?
[06:39:59] <BillCriswell> eah, forEach would only work in ie9 and up.
[06:39:59] <Mia> in terms of lmitations
[06:40:00] <Cork> depend
[06:40:02] <Cork> +s
[06:40:12] <Cork> if you're ok with dropping ie8 then no
[06:40:19] <Mia> ie9 --- since which windows is that the default
[06:40:24] <Mia> I mean since which windows (and up)
[06:40:32] <Cork> win7
[06:40:40] <Mia> like most of the things I am building right now probobly won't even work on ie9 anyway
[06:40:40] <Cork> vista used ie8
[06:40:45] <mooncup> greek: your wife?
[06:40:46] <Cork> and xp used ie6
[06:41:00] <Mia> hm
[06:41:21] <Mia> what about firefox and chrome (foreach)
[06:41:31] <BillCriswell> I think the highest Win XP can run is IE9.
[06:41:34] <Cork> supported for the last like 30 versions :)
[06:41:36] <greek> mooncup, I assumed you knew what a mooncup was
[06:41:42] <Mia> haha, okay.
[06:41:45] <Cork> BillCriswell: ie8
[06:41:46] <Mia> I'll go with it then!
[06:41:47] <Mia> thanks!
[06:41:50] <Cork> xp can't install ie9
[06:42:01] <Cork> ip9 demands d2d
[06:42:04] <Cork> *ie
[06:42:27] <BillCriswell> How do you keep track of that in your head?
[06:42:37] <Cork> BillCriswell: burned by it
[06:42:54] <Cork> i've lived through 10+ years of ie< 7 development :)
[06:43:40] <BillCriswell> Haha fair enough. I spent a fair amount of time developing in ie5 - ie7 but definitely not 10 years.
[06:44:03] <Cork> BillCriswell: i started web development when ie2 was a thing
[06:44:09] <Cork> <_>
[06:44:10] <BillCriswell> Cork: Damn.
[06:44:23] <Cork> and the new cool thing was document.writeln :)
[06:44:26] <carlton> (o )_( o)
[06:45:06] <Cork> meaning pre css
[06:45:24] <Cork> <font><center> FTW!
[06:47:36] <BillCriswell> Cork: Have you been using any javascript frameworks like Backbone or angular or anything?
[06:47:56] <Cork> tried, not really used
[06:48:18] <BillCriswell> Any of them jump out at you
[06:48:31] <Cork> not like something i like no
[06:48:57] <Cork> the first solution i start to think look interesting is es6 modules
[06:49:39] <Cork> well i have to admit i like es6 over all a lot
[06:50:03] <BillCriswell> I'm forcing myself to use Vue http://vuejs.org/ for a project and the adjustment in how I code things is pretty tough.
[06:50:23] <BillCriswell> Cork: Is that like what node does with require() basically?
[06:50:33] <Cork> kinda
[06:50:37] <Cork> it is inspired by it
[06:50:42] <Cork> but they have fixed a few things
[06:50:50] <BillCriswell> Oh nice.
[06:51:05] <Cork> es6 has imported a lot of things from popular frameworks
[06:51:42] <Cork> but my number one favorite by a LOOOOOONG shot is "let"
[06:52:10] <Cork> when you get used to using it it is a pain to go back to var
[06:52:42] <Cork> { let local = something.locate(); if(local) {} } local == undefined
[06:52:52] <Cork> no self executing functions needed!
[06:53:37] <BillCriswell> Yeah that's awesome.
[06:54:18] <Cork> and destructors and default arguments comes next
[06:54:27] <Cork> not a big fan of itterators though
[06:55:03] <BillCriswell> Javascript is becoming a big boy.
[06:55:19] <Cork> well js8 has had much of it for a while
[06:55:29] <Cork> its just that the standard is catching up
[06:55:34] <decx> i come online and the first line i read is a nerd porn line from BillCriswell
[06:55:48] <Cork> sadly google is moving to try to push dart and is slowing down on es6 support
[06:55:58] <BillCriswell> decx: Which one?
[06:56:09] <decx> [15:55:02] < BillCriswell> Javascript is becoming a big boy.
[06:56:10] <BillCriswell> decx: I don't have join/part visible.
[06:56:14] <Cork> lol
[06:56:14] <BillCriswell> decx: Hahaha nice
[06:56:25] <decx> it doesnt show a join anyway
[06:56:32] <decx> the bouncer is always on
[06:56:37] <BillCriswell> Ohhhhhh
[06:57:08] <decx> i had like an _away nick but that's just annoying me when other people have it
[06:57:11] <Cork> "i'm a baaad boooy"
[06:57:19] <Cork> enyone recognice the reference? :D
[06:57:41] <decx> well i'm stumped
[06:57:47] <BillCriswell> Can't put my finger on it Cork.
[06:57:52] <Cork> lol
[06:58:23] <Cork> (the reference was an old loony toons character)
[06:58:33] <BillCriswell> Bugs?
[06:58:38] <BillCriswell> Elmer?
[06:59:00] <Cork> lets see if i can find it on youtube
[06:59:06] <BillCriswell> Any of you want an Inbox invite?
[06:59:22] <Cork> inbox?
[06:59:25] <mooncup> I've got one but I can't use it :<
[06:59:29] <mooncup> cuz I have my own domain
[06:59:31] <Cork> you mean the new google thing?
[06:59:35] <mooncup> Cork: new gmail android app
[06:59:49] <Cork> ya, hmm not really interested
[06:59:50] <BillCriswell> Yes.
[07:00:00] <Cork> zimbra ftw! :)
[07:01:17] <Cork> hmm na, can't find it
[07:05:47] <BillCriswell> Cork: Was it Bugs or Elmer
[07:05:53] <BillCriswell> from your recollection.
[07:12:17] <Cork> BillCriswell: neither
[07:13:55] <BillCriswell> Oh.
[07:13:59] <BillCriswell> Who was it?
[07:14:18] <Cork> trying to remember...
[07:14:26] <Cork> was ages since i saw it
[07:15:20] <Cork> AH
[07:15:24] <Cork> the magician!
[07:35:34] <Kricir> is there a way to grab all children... I know .children() grabs the next element, but I want it cycle til there are no more?
[07:36:05] <Cork> Kricir: .nextAll()
[07:36:12] <Kricir> thank you
[07:36:29] <Cork> or .children().each()
[07:36:36] <Cork> depending on what you want to do
[07:37:36] <deadowl> It's been a while since I updated jquery UI. Does jquery-ui.min.css contain all of the CSS I need, or do I also need to include jquery-ui.theme.min.css and jquery-ui.structure.min.css?
[07:40:02] <Kricir> Cork: I'm looking to cut corners on a slideshow... $('.feature-slider-wrapper').corner("bite 30px").nextAll().corner("bite 30px"); but I need it to filter through all elements and run the same corner declaration?
[07:40:50] <Kricir> This statement only cut the corners on the .feature-slider-wrapper and nothing else
[07:44:46] <beefkitten> kricir:
[07:44:46] <beefkitten> $('.feature-slider-wrapper').children().each(function() {
[07:44:46] <beefkitten>   $(this).corner('bite 30px');
[07:44:46] <beefkitten> });
[07:44:48] <beefkitten> something like that?
[07:44:54] <decx> a jquery plugin for corners?
[07:44:59] <decx> now i've seen it all
[07:45:03] <beefkitten> ^ha
[07:45:45] <BillCriswell> beefkitten: What browsers do you need to support?
[07:46:17] <beefkitten> BillCriswell: code not for me, it is for kricir. I am not sure what they need to support
[07:46:42] <BillCriswell> beefkitten: Oh sorry haha.
[07:48:27] <BillCriswell> Kricir: What browsers do you need to support? This bite pattern can be accomplished pretty easily with just some CSS.
[07:49:01] <decx> look at the plugin, that's all it is
[07:49:02] <decx> http://malsup.github.io/jquery.corner.js
[07:49:19] <Kricir> Your top major browsers... I haven't seen concave radius with css, that's the plugin I am currently using
[07:49:36] <Kricir> I don't think anything less than ie8
[07:49:45] <BillCriswell> decx: It adds a lot of DOM elements.
[07:50:30] <Kricir> BillCriswell: do you know where some good documentation is I can see on how to do it with css?
[07:51:24] <decx> what the bite thing?
[07:51:28] <BillCriswell> Kricir: You can use multiple background images or ::before and ::after elements (with an extra element).
[07:51:42] <BillCriswell> decx: Yes.
[07:53:05] <BillCriswell> (The same background image with different positions) Kricir.
[07:53:44] <BillCriswell> Whoa, "cornflowerblue" is an actual CSS color.
[07:53:51] <Kricir> I was debating on just trying to do a css mask... but that isn't fully supported
[07:54:21] <d0de> if you're writing a system to process a given set of movement commands, but you're told "we may need different commands in future, keep that in mind", do you think it's a reasonable approach to pass the system a configuration object that has a "commands" object in it, and each movement function is an entry in the commands object? [13:04] == Deacydal has changed nick to Deacyde
[07:54:37] <BillCriswell> Kricir: Yeah, the background-images approach and styling pseudos would work pretty well across browsers.
[07:56:14] <BillCriswell> None of them let the background color through though, which kind of stinks.
[07:57:18] <Kricir> Which should work okay, cause I am just nesting divs
[07:58:32] <BillCriswell> Kricir: http://jsbin.com/tuqipelidu/1/edit?html,css,output
[07:58:33] <decx> lol http://jsfiddle.net/decx/vkycnooy/
[07:58:38] <BillCriswell> Actually a bit more CSS than I thought.
[07:58:51] <BillCriswell> decx: Haha you win.
[07:59:25] <BillCriswell> decx: How tough would it be to round them?
[08:00:08] <decx> no idea
[08:00:16] <decx> very
[08:00:18] <decx> ?!
[08:00:33] <BillCriswell> radial gradient?
[08:00:36] <BillCriswell> That's a thing right?
[08:01:36] <beefkitten> billcriswell: yeah but I don't think its supported below ie10
[08:01:38] <Kricir> Now here's the tricky part, how do I apply that same effect to a list of images
[08:02:29] <BillCriswell> beefkitten: Ah, got ya
[08:02:46] <BillCriswell> Kricir: I don't think you could on the image itself. You'd need to wrap them in elements.
[08:05:21] <BillCriswell> Kricir: http://jsbin.com/tuqipelidu/2/edit?css,output
[08:05:28] <Kricir> which they are technically wrapped in anchor tags and in list elements
[08:08:55] <Kricir> this is the effect I need to create http://c5tester.com/screenshot.png
[08:10:57] <BillCriswell> Oh, that'll be a pain.
[08:11:26] <Kricir> yeah I know... that's why I was hoping the jquery plugin would handle it... but I have failed
[08:14:29] <BillCriswell> If you get the gray and white frame as an image with a hole in the middle you could stretch a background image over the image.
[08:15:55] <Kricir> have I mentioned also making it responsive
[08:16:10] <beefkitten> lololol, that's fun
[08:16:50] <BillCriswell> Kricir: As long as the images maintain the same aspect ration it should be able to stretch ok.
[08:19:54] <Kricir> the only other thought I have is to cut out the borders, and then force them over the slideshow as a frame...
[08:20:08] <Kricir> Oh maybe that what you already said
[08:20:32] <BillCriswell> Kricir: Yes.
[08:21:21] <BillCriswell> Kricir: http://jsfiddle.net/setjzfbw/1/
[08:23:08] <BillCriswell> Damn, pointer-events support blows.
[08:24:45] <BillCriswell> Kricir: Can hack around that... can't recall the name of the method you need though.
[08:25:22] <robertmaxrees> fridaaaay
[08:26:23] <BillCriswell> I've worked from home all week. So bored.
[08:26:54] <robertmaxrees> that's right - how you doing?
[08:27:09] <BillCriswell> Kricir: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/document.elementFromPoint here it is.
[08:27:22] <BillCriswell> I'm good. Just learning Vue better, watching movies.
[08:27:34] <robertmaxrees> awesome.  liking vue more and more?
[08:27:42] <BillCriswell> Yes.
[08:28:02] <BillCriswell> It's neato.
[08:28:14] <robertmaxrees> any pain points you don't like about it?
[08:28:39] <BillCriswell> robertmaxrees: Ntohing jumping out at me yet. Most of the issues I've come across were just me I feel like.
[08:28:41] <reynierpm1> hi there I need some help with some code here, take a look here http://jsbin.com/mesogi/1/edit?html,js,console,output I need to add a key => value pairs to facturas array where key is the actual value the checkbox value and value should be the date on the third column of the table, how I can do that?
[08:29:39] <robertmaxrees> reynierpm1 arrays can't have named keys :)
[08:29:46] <robertmaxrees> objects can though
[08:30:01] <reynierpm1> robertmaxrees and then how I can achieve what I want?
[08:30:06] <robertmaxrees> use an object instea.d
[08:30:12] <robertmaxrees> if named keys are important, you want an object.
[08:30:19] <robertmaxrees> if order matters, you want an array.
[08:30:46] <reynierpm1> robertmaxrees can I give some example code? by object you mean factura = {} instead of factura = [] ?
[08:30:50] <robertmaxrees> yes
[08:31:10] <robertmaxrees> technically arrays are objects, too, but they have special rules about the property names.
[08:31:18] <robertmaxrees> objects allow you to name things yourself.
[08:32:01] <reynierpm1> robertmaxrees ok, after do that how do I set the values? the id I know how to get it using value while I iterates over items but how to get the date from the third column on each iterarion?
[08:32:45] <reynierpm1> robertmaxrees and how to set the values since I think push will not work here
[08:32:59] <robertmaxrees> push is for arrays, so you're correct :)
[08:33:01] <robertmaxrees> let me show you.
[08:33:16] <reynierpm1> robertmaxrees ok , thanks
[08:33:26] <robertmaxrees> so wait
[08:33:41] <robertmaxrees> are you trying to find all checked items and add those to an object?
[08:33:58] <reynierpm1> robertmaxrees if I send that object through Ajax $.post request it will be converted to an array right? I mean I can treat as array from server side?
[08:34:07] <robertmaxrees> slow down
[08:34:11] <robertmaxrees> one thing at a time ;)
[08:34:27] <reynierpm1> robertmaxrees no, I want to get all the rows on the table with tbody.facturaBody
[08:34:36] <robertmaxrees> regardless of checked stats?
[08:34:37] <bbclover> if I'm clicking some links on a page and doing some jquery, I should wrap with $(document).ready(function() { }); right? I have $('#hideOutlinesLink').click(toggleOutlines); so should I just do $(document).ready($('#hideOutlinesLink').click(toggleOutlines););? or do I need to wrap it a function?
[08:34:39] <robertmaxrees> *status?
[08:34:58] <robertmaxrees> bbclover need to wrap it in a function./
[08:35:01] <BillCriswell> bbclover: In a function.
[08:35:04] <robertmaxrees> document ready takes a function object.
[08:35:06] <reynierpm1> robertmaxrees yes, does does not matter to me, checked is used only for delete
[08:35:09] <bbclover> ok
[08:35:13] <robertmaxrees> reynierpm1 okay - one sec.
[08:36:51] <robertmaxrees> reynierpm1 what should the property names be then?
[08:36:54] <robertmaxrees> they "keys"?
[08:36:56] <robertmaxrees> and the "values"?
[08:37:15] <robertmaxrees> the value should be the checkbox value, right?
[08:37:30] <reynierpm1> robertmaxrees could be no_factura and fecha_factura
[08:37:53] <robertmaxrees> the number?
[08:37:59] <robertmaxrees> so the number and then the date?
[08:38:01] <robertmaxrees> hrm.
[08:38:40] <reynierpm1> the number should be the checkbox value is the same as checkbox id and is the same as second column text
[08:38:56] <reynierpm1> yes, you´re right first the number and then the date
[08:39:32] <robertmaxrees> hrm. this markup is kind of awkward for that.  can you add classes to make this a little easier?
[08:39:57] <robertmaxrees> the idea is to enumerate through the TRs and grab the key/value pairs that you want.
[08:40:05] <reynierpm1> robertmaxrees yes, use a class .fecha_factura on each column
[08:40:20] <robertmaxrees> i mean on the <td>
[08:40:26] <reynierpm1> feel free to modify my solution maybe is not the better let me show you how I build that able
[08:40:33] <robertmaxrees> the issue is that this relies on a certain order in the markup which isn't idea.
[08:40:38] <robertmaxrees> *ideal.  awesome.  one sec.
[08:41:10] <reynierpm1> I have update  the code take a look and already added the class as you say earlier
[08:41:18] <robertmaxrees> not looking at the bin atm :)
[08:41:38] <reynierpm1> no problem
[08:41:55] <lolmaus> How do i work with empty data-attributes? E. g. `<div data-isvalid>`
[08:42:05] <robertmaxrees> lolmaus define "work with"
[08:42:32] <cjohnson> give them 30 minute lunch breaks for every 8 hour shift lolmaus
[08:42:49] <cjohnson> and don't talk about religion
[08:45:08] <lolmaus> robertmaxrees: presence of such an attribute indicates a true state and and absence means false state.
[08:46:27] <lolmaus> robertmaxrees: i got used to the consitent approach of `.data()`, e. g. i use the same method for both reading and writing to the attribute.
[08:46:42] <robertmaxrees> reynierpm1 http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/yjtaz9rg/
[08:46:44] <robertmaxrees> get the idea.
[08:47:41] <lolmaus> robertmaxrees: but with blank attributes (which in HTML5 should mean "true") `$('<div data-isvalid/>').data('isvalid')` does not evaluate to `true`.
[08:48:06] <cjohnson> add a check if == "" ?
[08:48:31] <reynierpm1> robertmaxrees I get it, now if I send factura as a data parameter on $.post ajax request I can deal with this as array on server side, right?
[08:48:43] <robertmaxrees> reynierpm1 if you convert it to an array, maybe?
[08:48:50] <robertmaxrees> depends on what the server expects for the format and stuff.
[08:49:07] <reynierpm1> robertmaxrees ok let me try thanks brb in few minutes with results
[08:49:38] <robertmaxrees> lolmaus http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/sbgsbfLf/
[08:49:54] <robertmaxrees> gets converted to an empty string when you grab it with jquery.
[08:50:13] <robertmaxrees> empty strings are falsy in JS
[08:50:38] <robertmaxrees> lolmaus so do a === ''; to get your truthy or falsy value
[08:51:01] <robertmaxrees> or store the status bit in the data attribute, instead of using presence to determine the status.
[08:52:36] <lolmaus> robertmaxrees: `$('<div data-isvalid/>').data('isvalid')` returns an empty string. :(
[08:52:43] <robertmaxrees> correct.
[08:53:03] <robertmaxrees> so do === ''; to get your truthy/falsy value based on existence.
[08:53:52] <reynierpm1> robertmaxrees excellent I get it work with your code at frontend and adapt the server side and it works as I want
[08:53:53] <reynierpm1> thanks
[08:53:59] <robertmaxrees> reynierpm1 fsho
[08:54:54] <lolmaus> robertmaxrees: i want to be able to do `.data('isvalid', true)` and the check should not break. Is there a more elegant way than doing a check `data === "" or data === true`?
[08:55:06] <robertmaxrees> lolmaus not if you want to use .data()
[08:55:15] <lolmaus> robertmaxrees: okay, thank you.
[08:55:37] <robertmaxrees> .data() does some conversions under the hood that doesn't necessarily correlate to what the html5 spec
[08:55:47] <robertmaxrees> since .data() "caches" things into an object elsehwere.
[08:59:01] <catuca> Why won't this give me the valued picked out? http://jsfiddle.net/8ppbb2ua/

[09:03:04] <catuca> robertmaxrees, no matter what selection I make
[09:03:27] <robertmaxrees> err, right, because .val() gets you the first one.
[09:03:31] <robertmaxrees> do you want the checked one?
[09:04:45] <catuca> robertmaxrees, you are right...
[09:04:55] <catuca> robertmaxrees, oh man....do I struggle with jquery LOL
[09:05:07] <robertmaxrees> you want to select the checked on, not all of them ;)
[09:05:34] <catuca> right

[09:06:17] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[09:06:48] <robertmaxrees> or just do this: http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/8ppbb2ua/3/
[09:09:09] <catuca> quick question: http://jsfiddle.net/8ppbb2ua/4/ if I keep clicking on POST...the "warning" msg keeps reapperaring. how can I void that from happening?
[09:12:13] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/8ppbb2ua/5/
[09:12:18] <robertmaxrees> give it a class and see if it already exists.
[09:13:44] <catuca> ah k
[09:13:57] <catuca> so the jquery object will return 0 if it doesn't find it
[09:13:57] <catuca> okay
[09:14:01] <robertmaxrees> .length yeah
[09:14:06] <catuca> oh yes
[09:14:10] <catuca> .length
[09:14:12] <catuca> okay
[09:14:15] <catuca> one other question
[09:14:16] <robertmaxrees> otherwise you could just have the node in there and hide/show it instead.
[09:14:17] <catuca> hold on
[09:17:40] <robertmaxrees> kay
[09:17:48] <catuca> http://jsfiddle.net/8ppbb2ua/6/
[09:17:50] <catuca> see the issue now
[09:18:05] <robertmaxrees> you're doing this in a really convoluted way
[09:18:22] <robertmaxrees> can you modify the markup at all?
[09:20:17] <catuca> no
[09:20:21] <catuca> well
[09:20:22] <robertmaxrees> ugh.
[09:20:22] <catuca> hold on
[09:20:28] <catuca> let me fix stuff around
[09:20:33] <robertmaxrees> slow down lol
[09:21:02] <robertmaxrees> adding classes/IDs on those divs around each question would be pretty helpful.
[09:21:16] <robertmaxrees> because stuff like questions_yellowVegetables = $("input:radio[name=questions\\[yellowVegetables\\]]:checked"); is pretty weird
[09:22:03] <catuca> this is what I need to deal with: http://jsfiddle.net/8ppbb2ua/7/
[09:22:08] <catuca> we can't change the HTML
[09:22:11] <robertmaxrees> that sucks.
[09:22:31] <cjohnson> quit and find another job
[09:22:38] <robertmaxrees> or be reasonable.
[09:22:46] <robertmaxrees> you're going to have to do a lot of DOM traversal.
[09:23:35] <robertmaxrees> lots of .closest() and .find() and .next() type stuff.

[09:31:50] <catuca> robertmaxrees, http://jsfiddle.net/8ppbb2ua/9/
[09:45:45] <skullcrasher> if I have and object property like the following: this.modal = $(element).find('.modal').detach().appendTo('body');
[09:46:10] <skullcrasher> can I attach eventhandlers or is the modal not in the this.modal property anymore?
[09:46:44] <skullcrasher> it seems that an eventhandler bind to this.modal.on doesn't get triggered
[09:49:16] <robertmaxrees> i'd use event delegation in that case to simplify stuff.
[09:52:29] <robertmaxrees> skullcrasher http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/2ppnpuau/
[09:52:33] <robertmaxrees> this still works, either way.
[09:53:02] <skullcrasher> hmm yes ok
[09:53:09] <skullcrasher> maybe some bug in the plugin
[09:53:28] <skullcrasher> don't know if here's the appropriate channel
[09:53:36] <robertmaxrees> keep in mind that in many cases, modal plugins clone markup but ignore extra data.
[09:53:44] <skullcrasher> its the bootstraps modal shown.bs.modal event
[09:53:47] <robertmaxrees> so they might not respect your event listeners correctly.
[09:53:57] <robertmaxrees> i'd use a delegated listener and see if that works.
[09:54:16] <skullcrasher> ahh i try
[09:56:20] <skullcrasher> still no effect :(
[09:56:32] <robertmaxrees> share your code.
[09:56:43] <skullcrasher> sec
[09:58:45] <skullcrasher> http://paste.good-times.eu/index.php/KLLa1z/
[09:59:03] <robertmaxrees> that's not a delegated listener.
[09:59:32] <skullcrasher> no not this, this was the original
[09:59:46] <robertmaxrees> try something like $(document).on('bs.modal.shown', '.modal', function() { console.log("hello") }); - what happens?
[10:02:29] <skullcrasher> on document it's working hmm
[10:02:52] <robertmaxrees> that means something else is up - likely what i was talking about before with cloning.
[10:03:37] <skullcrasher> sure because it is appended to body and when the event bubbles up from there, the plugin element where the listener is on doesn't get the event because of its nested position
[10:03:53] <robertmaxrees> errr...
[10:03:58] <robertmaxrees> that's not what i mean.
[10:04:21] <skullcrasher> no not this, but that's what i could imagine happens
[10:04:35] <robertmaxrees> i mean that the directly bound listener is getting "discarded" because the modal that's getting shown is not the same object that you care about.
[10:05:33] <skullcrasher> hmm don't know
[10:05:43] <robertmaxrees> that's actually really common.
[10:05:57] <robertmaxrees> a lot of modal libraries will clone the markup and hide/show the clone instead
[10:06:00] <skullcrasher> I just changed from document to $(body) and it fires
[10:06:13] <skullcrasher> but if i change just 1 more level deeper it doesn't
[10:06:28] <skullcrasher> its bootstrap modal
[10:06:41] <robertmaxrees> probably because the modal isn't a child of the element you're binding the listener to.
[10:07:09] <skullcrasher> that's what I meant with the nested position in the dom, when the event bubbles up
[10:07:30] <skullcrasher> I think now it's clear, thanks
[10:07:31] <robertmaxrees> I'm lost about what you're trying to say then, but i'll believe you :)
[10:07:47] <skullcrasher> :P
[10:07:53] <skullcrasher> don't get confused ;)
[10:07:59] <robertmaxrees> lol
[10:16:24] <Rayon> Anyone know if it is possible to select 3 options in a selection tag with one click?
[10:16:25] <darkfrog> within an iframe (same domain) I am trying to fire a click event on the parent document, is $(window.parent.document).trigger('click'); not sufficient that make that happen?
[10:16:59] <robertmaxrees> Rayon do what now.
[10:17:15] <robertmaxrees> darkfrog is the parent frame's handler bound using jquery?
[10:17:41] <darkfrog> robertmaxrees: yes: $(document).click(function() { ... });
[10:18:00] <Rayon> robertmaxrees: i want to select 3 option tags with one click in a selection element
[10:18:32] <robertmaxrees> Rayon if you set multiple on the select tag, sure.
[10:19:03] <Rayon> But then if i only use HTML cannot select 3 at one click
[10:19:09] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[10:19:18] <robertmaxrees> paste up what you're doing in a fiddle.
[10:19:24] <Rayon> one second then
[10:19:29] <robertmaxrees> because i'm not grokking the question at all.
[10:19:33] <yosito> I have `$('#test-element .alert')`, and it finds the element, but it doesn't have a .length property. Does anyone know what's going on with that?
[10:19:40] <Rayon> hehhehe okay give me a second
[10:19:49] <robertmaxrees> yosito it's not finding the element then...
[10:19:52] <robertmaxrees> or $ isn't jquery.
[10:20:37] <robertmaxrees> yosito do console.log($.fn.jquery)
[10:20:39] <robertmaxrees> what do you get?
[10:20:48] <cjohnson> prob latter, even if it doesn't find anything it should have length 0 right
[10:21:04] <robertmaxrees> or it's not actually finding anything.
[10:21:12] <yosito> robertmaxrees: Well, $ is jQuery, the element is in the page, and `$('#test-element .alert')` returns `<div class="alert"></div>`
[10:21:20] <Rayon> http://jsfiddle.net/3xp4Lork/ you can select more then one by holding down shift but can i use jquery to always select 3 with one moues click
[10:21:28] <darkfrog> ah, figured out my problem.  If you care: window.parent.$(window.parent.document).trigger('click');
[10:21:32] <robertmaxrees> because $('.anything') can return an object that, at first glance, looks like a jquery object or a populated one.
[10:21:44] <cjohnson> why wouldn't it have a length property if it doesn't find anything?
[10:21:45] <robertmaxrees> yosito do the console log i suggested.
[10:22:02] <robertmaxrees> cjohnson sometimes people munge words around here ;)
[10:22:22] <yosito> robertmaxrees: Interesting; `Cannot read property 'jquery' of undefined`
[10:22:27] <robertmaxrees> bingo.
[10:22:29] <bbclover> Hey guys, something like $('<li>Print</li>').click(function() {}).appendTo(menu); will create and add a listener to this list objecterino?
[10:22:30] <robertmaxrees> where are you using $?
[10:22:39] <Rayon> so make it easier for the user to not have to hold down shift in order to select 3 option tags at the same time. This way the visitor just selects one option tag for example: 10:00 and jquery automaticly selects the 10:10 and 10:20
[10:22:42] <robertmaxrees> bbclover sure will, but don't do that.
[10:22:47] <robertmaxrees> use event delegation instead.
[10:23:38] <yosito> robertmaxrees: I'm using it inside of a function... it's working as expected everywhere else...
[10:23:48] <robertmaxrees> yosito huh?
[10:23:54] <robertmaxrees> yosito share your code maybe?
[10:24:00] <yosito> $('#test-element .input').val('test@test.com'); //populates the input
[10:24:24] <robertmaxrees> Rayon don't use inline event handlers like that :(
[10:24:30] <robertmaxrees> let me show you the easy way
[10:24:39] <bbclover> but robertmaxrees I have to create these elements and they do a different think depending on what I click
[10:25:03] <robertmaxrees> bbclover that doesn't change anything :) you can give them classes or other descriptors to change what they do.
[10:25:12] <bbclover> can you show me what you mean
[10:25:50] <robertmaxrees> $('parent').on('event', '.childType1', function() { /* stuff here is for child type 1 */ })
[10:26:15] <robertmaxrees> or $('parent').on('event', 'child', function() { /* conditionals in here for logic */ })
[10:27:10] <bbclover> well what about creating them?
[10:27:19] <robertmaxrees> give them a class or something instead.
[10:30:48] <robertmaxrees> Rayon http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/3xp4Lork/2/
[10:30:52] <robertmaxrees> you want something like this.
[10:31:06] <Rayon> Your a genius! :P thats what i wanted :P
[10:31:15] <yosito> robertmaxrees: Could it be that `$('#test-element .alert')` is selecting a class instead of an ID?
[10:31:23] <robertmaxrees> yosito do what now?
[10:31:40] <robertmaxrees> $('#test-element .alert') selects all ".alert" elements under #test-element
[10:31:56] <yosito> robertmaxrees: Right. And in this case there is only one.
[10:32:06] <robertmaxrees> yosito i'd need to see what you're doing.
[10:32:21] <robertmaxrees> the code you provided earlier doesn't tell me anything.
[10:32:51] <yosito> robertmaxrees: The selector returns; `[prevObject: jQuery.fn.init[1], context: document, selector: "#test-element .alert", jquery: "2.1.1", constructor: function…]`
[10:33:07] <robertmaxrees> that doesn't tell me much either.
[10:33:13] <robertmaxrees> that means you got a jquery object back.
[10:33:37] <lbmn> With jQuery, how do I get new width/height of a div after applying .css('transform', 'scale(x,y)') ?
[10:33:39] <robertmaxrees> could you share your code on a fiddle or something?
[10:34:00] <yosito> I guess I'll create a fiddle, but there's really not much else to say other than what I already said.
[10:38:08] <lbmn> To use getBoundingClientRect(), I have to step outside jQuery and get the div object a second time via document.getElementById...
[10:38:21] <robertmaxrees> you could get the object using .get(0) btw
[10:38:32] <robertmaxrees> that gets the raw dom node for you.
[10:39:13] <lbmn> OK, but does jQuery have a version of .width() / .height() that works with transform'd elements?
[10:39:41] <Prometheian> .css('width')?
[10:40:01] <robertmaxrees> i'm confused.  those methods should work.
[10:45:34] <lbmn> .get(0) doesn't seem to work also.  Using Version 38.0.2125.111 Ubuntu 14.04 (290379) (64-bit), jquery-2.1.1.min.js
[10:45:44] <Prometheian> ko.mapping allows for shoving a bunch of json data into a vm for an update and it doesn't bitch. But it seems that unless you have ALL the ko observables matched in the json it gets angry. There a way around this?
[10:46:28] <lbmn> ('#nav3').get(0) ==> "Uncaught TypeError: undefined is not a function"
[10:47:11] <robertmaxrees> lbmn console.log($.fn.jquery) - what do you get?
[10:47:39] <Prometheian> ibmn: $('#nav3')[0]
[10:48:20] <robertmaxrees> Prometheian i'd ask somewhere that would know about ko.mapping?
[10:48:25] <lbmn> "2.1.1"
[10:48:42] <Prometheian> I did ask in #knockoutjs but they're usually dead and I can get help in here occasionally. ^^
[10:49:04] <lbmn> Sorry, stupid typo, .get(0) works.
[10:49:16] <robertmaxrees> okay
[10:49:34] <robertmaxrees> Prometheian lol that doesn't change the topic of this channel ;) that's why i say that.
[10:49:38] <robertmaxrees> god speed though.
[10:49:59] <Prometheian> ty :)
[10:50:44] <lbmn> So $('#nav3')[0].getBoundingClientRect().width gets the scaled width, but $('#nav3').width(), $('#nav3').css('width'), and all other jQuery functions I've tried return unscaled width.
[10:51:11] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/outerwidth/ maybe?
[10:51:14] <Prometheian> What's your jQuery version?
[10:51:45] <lbmn> inner/outerWidth() return same as width(), unscaled.
[10:53:37] <robertmaxrees> wonder what's up
[11:07:13] <lbmn> I'm doing an interface prototype on http://libman.org/201411 for a navigation bar that will later slide out of view.  For some reason I can't seem to position the elements of that nav bar properly...
[11:18:39] <bbclover> hey guys I want to show something when I click it but hide it if I click anywhere else. How would I do that? I am trying $(document).click(function(e) { if (e is this element with id) show it else hide it });
[11:19:19] <bbclover> I don't know how to check if e is such an element though. e.target something something?
[11:19:24] <robertmaxrees> eeeh...
[11:19:42] <robertmaxrees> there are a few ways to skin that cat.
[11:19:52] <bbclover> it's like how in chrome robertmaxrees when you click tjhe menu but click anywhere else it hides it
[11:19:54] <robertmaxrees> e is the event, not the node.
[11:20:45] <robertmaxrees> you could instead do a transparent div over the page that closes it when you click it.
[11:20:50] <robertmaxrees> and removes the div.
[11:21:05] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, yeah, you'd need to check the e.target to see if it has what you want on it.
[11:21:18] <bbclover> well yeah, how do I use the e.target?
[11:21:32] <krambiorix> hi, i have a click handler on a table cell. But i that table cell i also have a select box. When i click the select box, the click event on the table cell is launched. How can i make the select box work?
[11:21:44] <robertmaxrees> bbclover like you would any other node.
[11:21:56] <robertmaxrees> $(e.target) would be the jquery-fied version.
[11:22:32] <robertmaxrees> krambiorix the select box should work just fine.
[11:23:11] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, bind to the click event on the select and run e.stopPropagation(); against the event object.
[11:24:55] <Cork> Mia: your still around?
[11:25:19] <krambiorix> robertmaxrees, but on click the select event, what should happen then?
[11:25:27] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[11:25:37] <robertmaxrees> you can't "click the select event"
[11:25:38] <robertmaxrees> have a fiddle?>
[11:27:17] <bbclover> robertmaxrees: can I do if ($(e.target) === $('#mydiv')) do something else do something else?
[11:27:32] <robertmaxrees> bbclover that won't work.
[11:28:00] <robertmaxrees> you could do if ($(e.target).prop('id') === 'mydiv') {}
[11:28:29] <bbclover> beautiful
[11:29:04] <BillCriswell> $(e.target).is('#mydiv') could work as well.
[11:29:07] <robertmaxrees> that too.
[11:29:18] <robertmaxrees> your original idea wouldn't work becuase $() !== $()
[11:30:25] <BillCriswell> Yeah, you'd need to do $(e.target).get() === $('#mydiv').get()
[11:30:51] <robertmaxrees> *.get(0)
[11:31:28] <krambiorix> robertmaxrees, yes , i had a jsfidlle but there it works :s
[11:36:48] <krambiorix> robertmaxrees, the stopimmediatepropagation works! thanks!
[11:36:58] <robertmaxrees> err...
[11:37:00] <robertmaxrees> okay
[11:38:17] <Velveeta> phew, i think i'm at a point that i'm happy calling it quits on our hackathon project
[11:39:20] <Velveeta> i migrated our storage module from a hybrid flat-file/mysql solution that was dependent on environment, to using couchdb, and then rearchitected all of the function chains throughout the entire application to be promise- vs callback-driven
[11:39:58] <_DB> im getting this error in a WYSI textarea Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'document' of null
[11:40:15] <_DB> anyone know whats causing it, i tried googling it with no luck
[11:40:25] <robertmaxrees> do what now?
[11:40:44] <robertmaxrees> sounds like you're trying to do something like myObject.document
[11:40:50] <robertmaxrees> but myObject doesn't exist.
[11:41:00] <_DB> well the script works
[11:41:13] <robertmaxrees> lol not helpful at all.
[11:41:17] <robertmaxrees> fiddle or something?>
[11:41:17] <_DB> like i have no problems on its functioning but that errorr gets displayed
[11:41:37] <_DB> itd be to much to fiddle
[11:41:38] <robertmaxrees> then you have a problem :)
[11:41:47] <robertmaxrees> squash bugs like that early and often.
[11:41:57] <_DB> The textarea pops up, when you click a button
[11:42:07] <_DB> it gets transferred from a hidden form
[11:42:27] <_DB> to an edit div ,then when I submit i run submit
[11:42:29] <robertmaxrees> none of this is going to help me help you, but okay :)
[12:05:21] <Bloomberg> guys!
[12:05:38] <Bloomberg> can I to put more than onevar into $.each() function?
[12:07:32] <robertmaxrees> ;huh?
[12:07:44] <robertmaxrees> you mean as the first arg?
[12:09:00] <Bloomberg> http://jsfiddle.net/1xLwLvvk/
[12:09:01] <Bloomberg> like this
[12:09:10] <robertmaxrees> no.
[12:09:29] <robertmaxrees> you need a single object.
[12:09:56] <Bloomberg> then how can I process two objects in the same function
[12:10:07] <robertmaxrees> two ways
[12:10:49] <robertmaxrees> either create a variable that you put all your stuff into, OR abtract out the callback and instead call $.each() separately on each object.
[12:14:03] <Bloomberg> ok
[12:17:24] <Bloomberg> some like this?
[12:17:25] <Bloomberg> http://jsfiddle.net/orewf1y2/
[12:17:36] <Bloomberg> but doesn't show me the time ontent
[12:17:46] <robertmaxrees> wat
[12:17:49] <robertmaxrees> no...
[12:18:20] <robertmaxrees> this does neither of the things i suggested.
[12:18:42] <robertmaxrees> what kind of objects are e['files'] and e['time'] ?
[12:20:22] <Bloomberg> there are an array of list of files and their according time creation
[12:20:39] <robertmaxrees> wait what?
[12:20:43] <robertmaxrees> so one has the files.
[12:20:49] <robertmaxrees> and the other the list of when they were created?
[12:20:51] <robertmaxrees> that's... scary
[12:20:58] <Bloomberg> yes the list of files inside a folder
[12:21:02] <Bloomberg> yes
[12:21:13] <Bloomberg> I'mcreating a wrapper of files management
[12:21:14] <robertmaxrees> why are you doing it that way?
[12:21:32] <robertmaxrees> don't separate out the names from the times like that.
[12:21:57] <robertmaxrees> do an array of objects and store the name and time properties that way.
[12:22:01] <Bloomberg> Is for set into separatd rows
[12:22:26] <robertmaxrees> display it however you want - your data isn't structured in a way that makes much sense.
[12:23:04] <robertmaxrees> it relies on an implicit relationship about where something exists in an array, which isn't reliable in cases like this imo
[12:25:25] <Snerf> trying to add multiple items with my JSON data to a timeline, but no go. Not sure how to add multiple items, the , between the 2 items doesnt seem to work: http://pastebin.com/4dh8Yf7V
[12:26:06] <robertmaxrees> in your "dataObject"?
[12:26:10] <Snerf> says it is unknown JSON
[12:26:15] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[12:26:18] <robertmaxrees> which part?
[12:26:25] <robertmaxrees> because nothing there is JSON.
[12:26:44] <Snerf> that is how it is formatted on their website.
[12:26:51] <Snerf> https://github.com/NUKnightLab/TimelineJS#json
[12:27:13] <Snerf> i'm just trying to add multiple items
[12:27:15] <robertmaxrees> the dataobject you mean.
[12:27:32] <Snerf> correct, to the dataObject
[12:27:44] <Snerf> with 1 item it works, more then 1. poof
[12:27:45] <robertmaxrees> show me what you tried that didn't work?
[12:27:52] <Snerf> what you see, doesnt work
[12:28:09] <Snerf> I added the [ ] and a comma between the 2 items
[12:28:22] <robertmaxrees> ah, so you're assuming the format probably.
[12:28:32] <robertmaxrees> can you show me a functioning example from them?
[12:28:46] <Snerf> yes, I pasted you the github link
[12:28:50] <robertmaxrees> *sigh*
[12:29:02] <robertmaxrees> that's not what i meant, but okay.
[12:29:11] <Snerf> you said one that works.. well, that one works
[12:29:17] <robertmaxrees> i mean a functioning example.
[12:30:21] <robertmaxrees> i'm trying to understand what this plugin does, what you're expecting, etc.
[12:30:28] <robertmaxrees> without reading all of the documentation myself.
[12:30:33] <Snerf> its a timeline
[12:30:40] <robertmaxrees> you're likely assuming that it takes an array of items when it doesn't.
[12:30:41] <Snerf> using their timeline.js
[12:31:28] <Snerf> it is meant to take an array.. just not seen how to do it with json. I prefers you to use a google doc, but it says it works with JSON as well
[12:31:46] <Snerf> pointless to have only 1 item on a timeline :)
[12:32:17] <wa5ted_> yo alll
[12:32:49] <robertmaxrees> Snerf something tells me the date array is what you want instead.
[12:33:27] <robertmaxrees> https://github.com/NUKnightLab/TimelineJS/blob/master/examples/example_jsonp.jsonp
[12:33:28] <robertmaxrees> yep
[12:33:55] <Snerf> ah.. I see...
[12:34:01] <robertmaxrees> single timeline object, mulitple entries in the date array.
[12:34:07] <Snerf> thanks :)
[12:34:10] <robertmaxrees> that's the problem.,
[12:34:26] <robertmaxrees> in the future, don't expect that you can simply create an array when it calls for an object or wahtever.
[12:34:48] <Snerf> well, I do , lol.. I was just understanding the object wrong
[12:34:50] <Snerf> thanks
[12:34:58] <robertmaxrees> kay

[12:44:32] <maddtech> I've got an issue.  I need to write some code to work with bootstrap's collapsable panel.
[12:45:03] <maddtech> I need to add an "close" or "open" to the hyperlink in the title so I can add a open/close icon.
[12:47:19] <robertmaxrees> okay?
[12:48:44] <maddtech> Can anyone help?
[12:49:50] <BillCriswell> maddtech: You're not being specific enough.
[12:50:29] <maddtech> What else can I tell?
[12:51:02] <maddtech> I'm not a jquery person so I have no clue where to start.
[12:51:22] <maddtech> The guy that does that type of development for me is off today and I have to get something to my boss quickly.
[12:57:23] <NoiseEee> what a bizarre request
[12:57:26] <NoiseEee> both by him and his boss

[13:38:18] <shoky> guess they're good ;)
[13:38:23] <robertmaxrees> yeah definitely.  they had a bulk of employees working in india and then did QA in israel.  went really well.

[14:57:52] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[14:58:01] <robertmaxrees> that's an awfully generic question.
[14:58:16] <Dragzole> now im lost
[14:58:43] <robertmaxrees> clarify your question.
[14:58:45] <Dragzole> i'd love to get some mp3's is there a way of doing that?
[14:58:49] <robertmaxrees> errr.

[14:59:41] <Dragzole> are you serious????
[15:07:16] <Reedyseth> Hello Guys !
[15:12:19] <robertmaxrees> hello Reedyseth
[15:13:53] <Reedyseth> Guy does anyone of you have work with an ajax call with thousands of records ?
[15:14:02] <Reedyseth> $.ajax
[15:14:03] <robertmaxrees> !ask @ Reedyseth
[15:14:04] <b-ot> Reedyseth: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[15:15:37] <Reedyseth> How to handle many records on a $.ajax call?
[15:15:59] <Reedyseth> IE crashes and Chrome don't
[15:16:21] <robertmaxrees> ajax doesn't process "records" so your question doesn't really make sense.
[15:17:06] <Reedyseth> robertmaxrees:I aske wrong. How to handle a heavy request ?
[15:17:14] <robertmaxrees> you probably have a lot of data you're inefficiently processing.
[15:17:53] <robertmaxrees> can you share an example of the data and of the code?
[15:18:03] <Reedyseth> robertmaxrees:I have a query with more that 10,000 records.
[15:18:14] <robertmaxrees> "records" means absolutely nothing without context.
[15:19:29] <Reedyseth> those records are return to $.ajax as a JSON
[15:20:11] <robertmaxrees> !paste @ Reedyseth
[15:20:11] <b-ot> Reedyseth: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[15:20:47] <robertmaxrees> if you're not going to share some code/data, then think of ways you can reduce the amount of data down and simplify things.  introduce pagination and similar ideas.
[15:21:37] <Reedyseth> robertmaxrees: http://jsfiddle.net/6hht60rf/
[15:23:00] <Reedyseth> robertmaxrees:response has a JSON with lost of information. If the query on retrieveClaimIndexAndGetTotalUnits.pl has less than 500 records then a JSON is created with those 500 records
[15:23:00] <robertmaxrees> and the data?
[15:23:16] <robertmaxrees> again.
[15:23:21] <robertmaxrees> "records" is meaningless.
[15:23:36] <robertmaxrees> can you provide a simple example of what that data looks like?
[15:25:23] <Reedyseth> robertmaxrees:http://jsfiddle.net/6hht60rf/1/
[15:25:49] <robertmaxrees> okay.  do you really need all of that data in the response?
[15:25:57] <robertmaxrees> and do you really need to display all of it at once?
[15:26:06] <Reedyseth> robertmaxrees: Sadly yes
[15:26:33] <robertmaxrees> then you'll need to split the response up.
[15:26:48] <robertmaxrees> and grab a smaller amount at a time.  when that's done, get the next bunch
[15:26:56] <robertmaxrees> lazy load things.
[15:28:17] <Reedyseth> I thought about that but I am working with Oracle and the information can be updated every minute so is a little bit tricky
[15:28:31] <robertmaxrees> something's going to have to give.
[15:28:57] <robertmaxrees> splitting things up will help.
[15:29:04] <robertmaxrees> does IE crash with just the load?
[15:29:09] <Reedyseth> Before I changed the application it used to work without ajax and the records were post very fast.
[15:29:48] <Reedyseth> yes, like IE has a timeout on the script execution
[15:29:58] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[15:30:04] <robertmaxrees> define "crash"
[15:30:32] <Reedyseth> any url to share a sceen ?
[15:30:47] <robertmaxrees> imgur
[15:30:59] <robertmaxrees> does the application actually fully crash?
[15:31:44] <tracker1> Reedyseth, which versions of IE do you need to support, you can do more via web-workers... alternatively, send back the IDs of records, and do a request for each batch of IDs to return the data for.
[15:31:59] <robertmaxrees> that could work, too.
[15:32:06] <robertmaxrees> or just list the IDs and fetch data on each click.
[15:34:05] <Reedyseth> This is the problem, where I work the database is a mess so the ID is a serial number and is not a sequence. Using Oracle ROWID is not an option
[15:35:09] <Reedyseth> This is the message from IE 8: :Stop running script? A script on this page is causing your web browser to run slowly. If it continues to run, your computer might become unresponsive.:
[15:35:26] <robertmaxrees> right, because you're tossing back too much data.
[15:35:32] <robertmaxrees> that's the entire problem.
[15:37:09] <Reedyseth> I will have to change the application with a few tweaks, I just thought that there was a work around with $.ajax
[15:37:19] <Reedyseth> Thank you guys for your ideas !
[16:41:40] <dunpeal> What's the most elegant way to insert a checkbox into a div?
[17:20:05] <aidan> How can I make this code something that I can use promises with? https://dpaste.de/reP6
[17:20:43] <robertmaxrees> that $.get() call returns a deferred.
[17:20:44] <aidan> It might fulfil it's promise immediately or when the $.get returns.
[17:28:12] <aidan> https://dpaste.de/pWvw
[17:29:31] <aidan> Something like that ... the calling code (line 28) is how I'm expecting it to work.
[17:30:08] <aidan> I'm just not sure how loadStorageCredentials is supposed to look and there's not much about creating deferreds in the docs
[17:32:06] <aidan> oh ... I see, I'm looking in the wrong place
[17:32:07] <aidan> http://api.jquery.com/deferred.promise/
[17:39:03] <aidan> I think I'm getting closer: https://dpaste.de/7r2D#L1
[17:51:40] <aidan> yeah that works ... awesome.
[18:06:08] <jsc802> can someone help me figure out how to hide 'install theme' on this page: http://www.nvrblvd.com
[18:12:03] <beefkitten> jsc802: $('body').find('a[href="http://themecloud.co/themes/narnia-two/"]').hide()
[18:15:18] <jsc802> beefkitten: it didnt work
[18:15:37] <beefkitten> whelp it works in the chromes console
[18:15:42] <jsc802> i think its because the link itself is dynamically put there?
[18:15:47] <jsc802> oh hm
[18:16:05] <beefkitten> That could be why, I'd have to see more code to know. Throw it in a fiddle if you want
[18:21:24] <jsc802> beefkitten: it works if i put it in a settimeout
[18:21:26] <jsc802> thanks
[18:21:36] <jsc802> is there any built in jquery function to make something run only after everything else has?
[18:22:08] <beefkitten> jsc802: heh.. that may not be the best approach. there is $(document).ready(function() { //your code here})
[18:22:28] <beefkitten> Might work, not sure how the node is being added to the dom
[18:22:46] <jsc802> well $(function(){ }); didnt work
[18:23:04] <jsc802> ill try that tho
[18:24:02] <beefkitten> $(function() {})): is executed in place, so if the link is in not yet in the DOM when the function executes, it won't work
[18:25:29] <beefkitten> $(document).ready(function(){}): is used to execute code once the DOM has been fully loaded
[18:27:46] <sacho_> $(function () {}) is equivalent to $(document).ready(function () {})
[18:29:24] <aidan> ohh Promises are nice. Promise all the things!
[18:29:31] <beefkitten> Ahh really, I didn't realize that
[18:50:29] <high5> Hey guys, I have a button click handler that detects which of three buttons are clicked.  There are then 3 if statements that hide/show depending on which button is clicked.  For some reason the hide/show functions are not working.  The console is printing the log statements correctly for each if but not completing the show hide functions - no action is taken at all.  Here is a snippet of the code. http://pastebin.com/niufv25X
[19:08:16] <maddtech> Anyone on that can answer a question?
[19:09:04] <Robdgreat> not until you've asked it
[19:09:06] <Snerf> just ask
[19:10:45] <maddtech> I'm using this code, http://www.codeshare.io/FSuqf , with my bootstrap template.  It's adding the active just fine to the li element but it's not going to the url that's selected in the navigation.
[19:13:03] <Unopoo> I defined a function in which I use $.ajax to get the content of a server file, but, how can I return the data this $.ajax received? I'm doing it like this:http://jsfiddle.net/5sL2to6n/, but the return statement outside the $.ajax is undefined
[19:13:11] <Snerf> is the function even run ? added some console.log()'s to it?
[19:14:33] <Robdgreat> maddtech: I don't see anything that tells it to go anywhere. Also you might be interested in the toggleClass() function
[19:14:37] <Snerf> Unopoom you cant do it like that, because success is async
[19:14:56] <Robdgreat> er, method
[19:15:30] <Unopoo> Snerf: then how could I return the data ?
[19:15:31] <ilhami> anyone who has experiecne with grunt?
[19:15:41] <ilhami> experience
[19:16:02] <Snerf> Unopoo, you cant like that
[19:16:11] <Robdgreat> ilhami: ask in #grunt
[19:16:27] <Unopoo> if change it to sync work?
[19:16:34] <maddtech> Robdgreat I'm new to jquery and I'm not 100% sure what you are talking about.
[19:16:51] <ilhami> thanks.
[19:17:09] <Robdgreat> maddtech: you're checking if a class is present and adding if it isn't. toggleClass does that for you
[19:17:33] <Snerf> Unopoo, use a call back fucntion to do it
[19:17:59] <Robdgreat> maddtech: but my other point was that nothing in your code instructs it to go to a different page
[19:18:40] <maddtech> Okay.  When I looked at toggleClass, it looks like I have to specify two classnames.  I just have one.  How to I tell it to go to another page?
[19:19:02] <Unopoo> Snerf: but, isn't success:function(){} is a callback function? I need to callback another in success function?
[19:19:11] <Snerf> Unopoo, correct
[19:19:20] <intothev01d> you could use a callback, but why when you have promises. just use then or done/fail
[19:19:44] <Robdgreat> maddtech: the usual way is with a link
[19:19:47] <Snerf> Unopoo, or use return inside success.. prolly works as well
[19:20:26] <Snerf> I have only done it with a callback a function
[19:20:31] <maddtech> Okay.  Once again, I know very little about jquery so I'm still lost.
[19:20:50] <intothev01d> return the ajax method entirely and then use requestSnippetsJSON.then(success fn, fail fn)
[19:21:10] <intothev01d> or requestSnippetsJSON.done().fail()
[19:21:34] <Unopoo> Snerf: no , it didn't work, suppose I should use sync post or another callback
[19:21:37] <Unopoo> thank you
[19:21:55] <Robdgreat> maddtech: a link has nothing to do with jquery. do you know very little about html?
[19:22:10] <Snerf> Unopoo, then use a callback. bad idea to not make it async
[19:22:18] <maddtech> no smart ass but when I take out the jquery, the link works just fine.
[19:22:19] <Robdgreat> maddtech: <a href="foo.html">click to go to foo</a>
[19:22:24] <intothev01d> yea b/c it will lock up the browser until the request is done
[19:22:30] <Robdgreat> ok, I don't have time for this. good luck.
[19:22:41] <maddtech> whatever.
[19:23:06] <drej> so much anger
[19:23:51] <Robdgreat> one last thing. educate yourself http://api.jquery.com/event.preventdefault/
[19:27:03] <Snerf> poor little fella, wan away
[19:29:32] <Robdgreat> oh hahaha
[19:29:45] <Robdgreat> don't flippin' insult me when I'm trying to help you
[19:30:03] <Robdgreat> did he leave before or after I solved his issue?
[19:30:12] <Robdgreat> I have parts and ragequits and joins hidden
[19:30:17] <Snerf> you dont know ?
[19:30:40] <Robdgreat> so I'm afraid not
[19:32:18] <Unopoo> intothev01d: I'm not sure how to do what you said, but I did it like this: http://jsfiddle.net/5sL2to6n/1/
[19:32:18] <Unopoo> but snippets is the whole ajax request object, not the response it received, where I did wrong?
[19:32:46] <intothev01d> ok, you can remove the success function
[19:32:52] <Snerf> thats not a callback
[19:33:08] <intothev01d> you'll have access to a succesful reponse in the done
[19:33:12] <intothev01d> and error in fail
[19:33:32] <intothev01d> there's nothing to return in done, that's where your data is going to be
[19:35:23] <Unopoo> Aha
[19:36:35] <intothev01d> Unopoo, http://jsfiddle.net/5sL2to6n/2/
[19:37:09] <intothev01d> you can read about it here http://api.jquery.com/jquery.ajax/
[19:38:02] <intothev01d> also if you don't add fail() you won't have an error handler. or you can use then that takes both success and errors functions
[19:38:14] <intothev01d> then()
[19:40:56] <Unopoo> intothev01d: thankyou, tha's exactly what I modified to
[19:40:56] <Unopoo> but, why can't I add done() in side the requestSnippetsJSON(), to the $.ajax of it?
[19:41:34] <Unopoo> from the code stucture, that seems the same to me. althought, I tried to and it fail my guess
[19:45:36] <intothev01d> it's not the same. the request goes off and gets data while the rest of the code moves along. using the callback or promise allows you to execute a function later and actually access the values. and the console.log(snippets) should be inside the done. it's late
[19:46:16] <intothev01d> so it won't have value until it's finished receiving data from the request
[19:46:34] <Snerf> I use the callback() method myself, works perfectly
[19:47:04] <intothev01d> promises are basically callbacks. a callback would work fine here as well
[19:47:12] <intothev01d> but promises offer other advantages
[19:47:17] <intothev01d> and people should get used to using them
[20:06:54] <Velveeta> i just finished converting a project from callbacks to promises
[20:07:19] <Velveeta> i prefer the ease of =composition you get with promise chains
[20:20:10] <x86> promises?
[20:20:52] <x86> I'm not familiar with the concept, functionally in that context
[20:28:43] <Prometheian> I can't get my ko binding to work correctly, anyone mind taking a look? I swear I'm doing all this correctly! http://jsfiddle.net/ox711gh6/1/
[20:46:12] <huleo> hiya
[20:46:46] <huleo> I have one-page with fixed menu, menu with mere anchor links - only scrolling to given section
[20:47:15] <huleo> problem is - how to identify those links as "active", live? just a class "active" to the active one
[20:47:19] <huleo> hmm
[20:47:57] <huleo> More or less, out of several sections, how will I get the one currently being visible the most? (taking up most screen space)
[20:48:05] <huleo> sections being just a div, whatever
[20:48:32] <stephen> give all elements in question a common class
[20:48:39] <huleo> they have it
[20:48:51] <stephen> then use a selector $("classname:active").on()
[20:49:04] <huleo> :active selector? hmm, let me google
[20:49:59] <huleo> wait, I think that's now what I'm looking for
[20:50:04] <huleo> I have functino triggering on scroll
[20:50:19] <huleo> $(window).scroll(function() { ... })
[20:50:21] <huleo> that's easy
[20:50:54] <huleo> thing is, how can I get which element out of given set takes up most screen space, i.e. is most visible?
[20:51:08] <huleo> (in current viewport)
[20:51:56] <stephen> huleo, consider this jsfiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/tK67w/3/
[20:52:10] <huleo> var currAnchor = $('.section.anchored:in-viewport').first().find('.anchor').attr('id'); <- that's my current code, improvised and doesn't work as I want it to
[20:52:20] <stephen> "Most visible"?
[20:52:30] <stephen> No such thing. Do you mean largest?
[20:52:58] <stephen> rather, largest, most in viewport, and highest z-index?
[20:53:16] <huleo> out of given set which element takes most space in current viewport
[20:53:29] <huleo> they're not overlaying one another, just to make things simpler
[20:54:03] <huleo> basically - on one page - I want to know which section is currently 'active", i.e. visible, so I can mark it nicely
[20:54:15] <huleo> (anchor link leading to it)
[20:55:12] <huleo> $('.smth:in-viewport).first() ... is almost acceptable, except...there is fixed menu on the site, and elements hidden beneath it are still interpreted as being in the viewport
[20:55:23] <huleo> fixed meaning "position: fixed;" ;)
[20:55:44] <huleo> so the previous element that we already scrolled through is still the "active" one
[20:59:12] <stephen> huleo, You'll neeed to exclude all elements which have a "offsetLeft" value which is less than the highest value of "offsetRight" of any fixed elements
[21:00:13] <huleo> I'm not talking horizontal scrolling
[21:04:01] <ACidRain2012> how can i delegate all links in jquery?
[21:04:18] <ACidRain2012> $('body a').click(function() { just doesnt do it
[21:05:46] <sacho> see the documentation for .on()
[21:06:43] <stephen> huleo, I know.
[21:07:15] <stephen> Basically, there's nothing that will automatically count those fixed alements against the container's dimensions
[21:07:30] <ACidRain2012> sacho, are you sure? http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[21:07:47] <sacho> did you look at the documentation for .on?
[21:07:55] <stephen> But, if you have fixed elements on the left side of the container, you want them to count as increasing the left.
[21:08:17] <sacho> ACidRain2012, I don't know what you're asking me to be sure of.
[21:08:27] <ACidRain2012> ah. fixed it
[21:08:37] <ACidRain2012> $('body').delegate("a", "click", function() { what i was looking for
[21:08:38] <stephen> huleo, Is there a possibility you could post a copy of the HTML somewhere? At least a static version of the dom you're looking at to run examples against?
[21:09:41] <huleo> actually I think I've found what I'm looking for - http://jsfiddle.net/x3V6Y/
[21:09:53] <huleo> tinkering with it to fit my case
[21:25:33] <high5> Does anyone know a nuance of the jquery show/hide functions that wouldn't allow them to work in an if statement? I can get into my if statement, proven by a log statement, but the show or hide functions are not working…there are no errors being reported as well.
[21:27:05] <stephen> high5, Are these if statements inside a for loop?
[21:27:17] <high5> No they are not
[21:27:53] <stephen> Hmm..l could you post the code somewhere?
[21:28:16] <stephen> There's a few situations where they might get queued in the eventloop for a later tick
[21:32:33] <huleo> ok, got it to work
[21:32:50] <huleo> "it's dirty but it works" :-)
[21:35:36] <ACidRain2012> im not sure what i need to do here
[21:35:38] <ACidRain2012> eh
[21:37:08] <high5> stephen: Could this be a que issue? I have 3 buttons submitting to a click handler.  The handler detects which button was clicked and passes that info to a function.  Based on the which button was clicked an if statement block is executed within the function that shows or hides the other buttons.  I can get the code to log that it entered the correct if statement based on what button was clicked but it doesn't actually show or hide any of the buttons.
[21:37:15] <high5> Example http://jsfiddle.net/high5/1fu5gjxy/1/
[21:37:55] <Unopoo> I remember it worked this morning, but now I don't know where I did wrong, it's not working again: snippets is undefined

[21:53:15] <stephen> There you go
[21:54:04] <stephen> high5, You just didn't update the selectors on the individual lines. You were always just hiding the same 2 buttons
[22:07:27] <high5> stephen: thanks! JSfiddle is working perfectly.  For some reason though the code is not responding to the changes you suggested at all.  Any ideas?
[22:07:45] <high5> http://jsfiddle.net/high5/1fu5gjxy/6/
[22:09:29] <stephen> high5, Did you forget to save and refresh?
[22:09:41] <stephen> Make sure you are copying over the HTML as well
[22:11:58] <high5> yup copied over, saved, refreshed, double checked twice.  I'm in chrome…could it be browser specific?
[22:14:06] <high5> stephen: looks to be the same in safari
