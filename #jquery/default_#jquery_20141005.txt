[00:06:10] <HikaruBG> hey guys
[00:06:15] <HikaruBG> anybody awake?
[00:07:00] <sinequanon> yup
[00:18:18] <HikaruBG> how can I select element, by the content. for example: If I have <li>First</li><li>second</li><li>Third</li>... and so on I would like to select an element that contains the keyword 'Second'
[00:19:58] <_rgn> google this: jquery find by text content
[00:20:21] <HikaruBG> OK Thanks _rgn!
[00:20:47] <_rgn> difference between ready and onload is that ready fires when DOM is ready, and onload when EVERYTHING has completed loading, images too.
[00:21:36] <HikaruBG> Thanks again! Actually this question I asked while ago, and I found the answer, but Thanks again! :)

[06:43:27] <EoN> guys. i see in the documentation that you can't 'chain' popups. ie can't have popups within popups. but can you have a popup called from a PANEL?

[06:53:10] <EoN> and useful
[07:37:41] <jcool> should we link jquery to online or download a copy and then link?
[07:52:01] <mgpl> jcool: both
[07:52:29] <jcool> mgpl, looking towards perfomance and other things that helps sites to run well what is the better option?
[07:53:30] <mgpl> jcool: http://pastebin.com/6L9FBWvk
[07:54:49] <joepie91__> mgpl: huh. what's the idea behind that?
[07:55:16] <jcool> mgpl, ah got that ;) if first scripts fails to load somehow we have backup of copy in our server to do same.
[07:55:20] <jcool> excellent
[07:55:25] <mgpl> you cant always rely on online resource to be available. so if you cant download then use local version
[07:55:35] <mgpl> jcool: right
[07:56:08] <mgpl> its rather better to download from a cdn, but it may not always be available
[07:56:08] <joepie91__> mgpl: how does this work wrt the execution/loading order of the browser?
[07:56:16] <joepie91__> or is it just a fallback in case the CDN is dead?
[07:56:23] <mgpl> joepie91__: fallback
[07:56:33] <joepie91__> aha
[07:56:43] <joepie91__> have to admit, haven't seen this one before :)
[07:57:30] <mgpl> the first script sets window.jquery and if it is not set in the next line (not downloaded) it loads local resource
[07:59:33] <mgpl> joepie91__: you can check out html5boilerplate project to see this kind of tricks/tips with js/css etc

[08:09:00] <nikhildaga> hello
[09:18:50] <mooru> i have a jquery script to hide stuff on my web page but the content shows up as the broswer loads than hides. How can i make it not show up at all ie to hide from the very beginning. it does like a few seconds lapse
[09:28:46] <rpag> mooru, don't use JS for that, hide the element with CSS
[09:28:59] <rpag> display: none; usually works.
[09:29:36] <rpag> jquery is probably waiting for the DOM to be ready/loaded, so you will see lag
[09:29:49] <mooru> rpag: but if i use display none, can i still show it with slidetoggle
[09:29:56] <rpag> sure, should be able to
[09:30:06] <mooru> rpag: ok

[13:14:48] <taxen> Hey everyone! I'm working on a grid where I need to loop through some data and build "grid items". Every 3 items needs to be wrapped in a "row" div. Here's my current take on it, but this doesn't take into account the last row of the loop if there are less than 3 items... Any ideas how to fix this? http://pastebin.com/1BaCKfLd
[13:19:14] <shoky> Paradisee: because you append it to a positioned element, so the clone's absolute position becomes relative to the droppable.  here's a way to fix it http://jsfiddle.net/hxttz0jx/18/
[13:20:38] <shoky> Kartagis: look at your console
[13:23:12] <Prometheian> I'm building a viewmodel (just learned about it) and I have a jsonp ajax call in it. As far as I know jsonp calls require the method call to be sent in the get. Is there a way I can get it to correctly call another methon on my vm? http://www.hastebin.com/xicurijido.js
[13:34:57] <shoky> Prometheian: this should probably work  http://www.hastebin.com/qosaxiluko.js
[13:35:17] <shoky> putting "self.bindMembers" in the url itself definitely won't :P
[13:35:36] <shoky> (because jsonp calls are made from a global context)
[13:36:01] <Prometheian> That did work, thanks a ton! I'm not super familiar with the ins-and-outs of jsonp.
[13:39:47] <shoky> Prometheian btw you're re-writing that player_list array instead of just writing to it (i.e. by calling it as a function). come to #knockoutjs if you wanna discuss that
[13:40:18] <Prometheian> I'm not sure what you mean but I'm not one to turn down good advice, I'll head on over!

[15:14:24] <Jattenalle> first argument*

[15:18:22] <WachisuSAma> Hello everyone! I have a question and i need some directions. Help would be appreciated!!! So, i'm creating a discount code page and i want a simple form input field that the Administrator can use to select the products he want to be valid for the coupon. For instance, i make a coupon JDJ29DKKI09DJ, is should be active for all Apple and Samsung products, i'll have a  dropdown like menu where he can select those groups based on e
[15:18:38] <WachisuSAma> Any suggestions? Where should i look? What should i use?
[15:19:02] <Jattenalle> "based on e"
[15:19:04] <Jattenalle> you got cut off
[15:19:29] <WachisuSAma> Based on either Database fields where i store certain products or products that are set on the website manually
[15:19:41] <WachisuSAma> Either hardcore it or fetch the data directly from the databse
[15:20:00] <WachisuSAma> Hard code* lol, sorry
[15:20:23] <WachisuSAma> Let me give a better example
[15:20:57] <WachisuSAma> I have Electronics->Laptops->Apple/Samsung/etc/etc->CPU etc
[15:21:41] <WachisuSAma> The admin would have a field that would show Electronics, and if he'd leave it on Electronics the coupon code would be for ALL electronics. If not Electronics i can continue my way to Laptops and so on
[15:36:28] <WachisuSAma> Was i a bit unclear?
[15:40:52] <frank_o> WachisuSAma: i'd use https://github.com/plataformatec/simple_form
[15:41:33] <WachisuSAma> One moment, checking it out! I appreciate it
[15:42:53] <frank_o> WachisuSAma: also https://github.com/ssimeonov/couponsgem
[15:43:11] <frank_o> idk though. this has nothing to do with jquery anyway.
[18:10:49] <TiMike> hi, i am doing a $.getJSON call on a local json file with 10 entriesâ€¦ every time i load my page they appear in a different, seemingly random orderâ€¦ is there a way to display them in the exact order as the json file?
[18:13:16] <TiMike> did i explain that ok? :/
[18:16:08] <blue_warlock> hi
[18:16:11] <blue_warlock> someone on ?
[18:46:06] <shoky> TiMike what's the json look like? and how are you traversing it
[18:52:41] <TiMike> shokyâ€¦. example
[18:52:58] <TiMike> {
[18:52:59] <TiMike>   "The Knack": "My Sharona",
[18:52:59] <TiMike>   "The Emotions": "Best of My Love" }
[18:53:36] <TiMike> js:
[18:54:27] <TiMike> $.getJSON(url, function(data) {
[18:54:27] <TiMike>       var customChart = [], artist, song;
[18:54:27] <TiMike>       $.each(data, function(artist, track) {
[18:54:27] <TiMike>         artist = artist;
[18:54:27] <TiMike>         song = track;
[18:54:28] <TiMike>         customChart.push({ artist:artist, song:song });
[18:54:28] <TiMike>       });
[18:54:29] <TiMike>     });
[18:58:06] <shoky> TiMike next time use a pastebin
[18:58:40] <shoky> TiMike is the json under your control?
[18:59:07] <shoky> cause to be ordered it'd need to be an array instead of an object
[18:59:47] <shoky> e.g.  [{"artist": "The Knack", "title": "My Sharona"}, {...}, ...]
[19:01:46] <TiMike> oops sorry
[19:01:55] <TiMike> yes under my control
[19:04:00] <TiMike> shoky.. but each time through, i am pushing it to an arryâ€¦. no?  â€”â€” customChart.push({ artist:artist, song:song });
[19:04:30] <shoky> yes but that's already inside the $.each loop whose order you can't be certain of, because data is an object, not an array
[19:04:40] <shoky> well, just have your json be in the format you already need it
[19:04:51] <shoky> then you don't need to convert it into that array
[19:06:05] <shoky> [{"artist": "The Knack", "song": "My Sharona"}, {"artist": "The Emotions", "song": "Best of My Love"}]
[19:12:28] <Darkingz> has anyone here used dropzone.js?
[19:13:07] <TiMike> thx sjoky!
[19:13:14] <TiMike> shoky!
[19:13:55] <shoky> np TiMike

[19:22:33] <blue_warlock> nothing ?
[19:53:53] <daynaskully> {Q} how can i call a function and then set an interval on it?
[21:07:33] <P0rk> blue_warlock, I am no expert, but I think it has something to do with combining inline js and jquery. Don't use inline calls to jquery funcitons as a  matter of style if nothing else.
[21:13:06] <P0rk> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/drnyuavL/9/ works with 2.1
[21:13:51] <P0rk> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/drnyuavL/10/ works with 1.64
[21:17:29] <P0rk> that was a while ago, I see.
[21:19:50] <P0rk> is there a way to get all the continuous next siblings of a certain class?
[21:20:44] <prawnosun> yes
[21:21:09] <P0rk> in other words, I have a tr.formfield element that has 3 conditional rows after it that need to be hidden. $("tr.formField").siblings(".fieldDetails") gives me all
[21:29:22] <prawnosun> yes
[21:29:31] <P0rk> spam?
[21:31:29] <prawnosun> no
[21:37:59] <P0rk> with radio buttons, how do you select the field whose value you are setting?
[21:38:46] <prawnosun> use value()
[21:39:49] <P0rk> That doesn't give the field...just the value
[21:41:06] <sinequanon> what do you mean by 'field'? the label?
[21:41:49] <P0rk> with radio buttons, the 'name' attribute is the same so that you can only select one radio button.
[21:42:45] <P0rk> I am trying to setup a details panel that when a radio button is selected, a panel drops down with more details.
[21:43:04] <sinequanon> $('#some-element').attr('name') ?
[21:43:50] <P0rk> $("#"+$("Input:radio").attr("name"))?
[21:44:44] <sinequanon> $(document).on('click', '#my-radio', function() { console.log( $(this).attr('name') ); });
[21:45:05] <P0rk> when you serialize the inputs on a form, how do radio buttons add to the serialized data?
[21:45:25] <sinequanon> same as any other form control: key-value pair
[21:45:49] <sinequanon> or, more specifically, name-value
[21:46:42] <P0rk> thanks for the help. How would you make a "details" portion on a tabular form field?
[21:47:05] <P0rk> something like: Are you seeing a counselor? Yes*  No
[21:47:24] <P0rk> then if yes is selected, a panel drops down with:   name: _____duration:_____
[21:48:12] <sinequanon> is that a UI pattern you'll use in multiple places?
[21:48:27] <P0rk> Roughly 50 times in one form
[21:48:30] <P0rk> so far
[21:48:34] <sinequanon> so, yes :)
[21:48:39] <P0rk> yep
[21:48:41] <P0rk> ugly, I know
[21:50:06] <sinequanon> and do all of those yes/no radio buttons have the same "value" attribute?
[21:50:16] <sinequanon> i.e., value="true" or value="yes"
[21:50:28] <P0rk> some are like :roomate, alone
[21:50:40] <sinequanon> oh, ok
[21:50:42] <P0rk> but I can hide them as 1 or 0 with different labels. So yes, technically
[21:51:11] <P0rk> most are like this: have you done any of the following drugs:
[21:51:13] <P0rk> then a list of drugs
[21:51:29] <P0rk> If any are selected, a panel asking 3 questions drops down for each drug selected
[21:51:38] <sinequanon> right, but not all questions are in a yes/no format...right?
[21:51:53] <P0rk> right
[21:51:56] <sinequanon> maybe not the best solution, but off the top of my head...
[21:52:32] <sinequanon> $(document).on('click', '.show-details', function() { /*...show your details pane...*/ });
[21:52:53] <sinequanon> and then add the "show-details" class to any radio buttons that need a details pane
[21:53:23] <P0rk> that's the easy part...
[21:53:51] <sinequanon> oh, did i misunderstand your question?
[21:54:05] <P0rk> gimme a minute, I'm almost done with a fiddle.
[21:54:09] <sinequanon> k

[22:09:40] <P0rk> jesus what an ugly mess. thanks for the offer to help, but I gotta start over. This is too much bs. I'll check back
[22:10:54] <sinequanon> lol ok
[22:11:33] <P0rk> I need a procesural way to generate forms. some function I can pass arguments to to create complex forms. Hasn't someone made something like this?
[22:13:39] <sinequanon> yikes, why would you want that?
[22:14:07] <P0rk> I could put the questions in a simple json format since they are all really simple quesitons...
[22:14:30] <sinequanon> if you use JS for that you're entering a world of hurt
[22:15:07] <P0rk> Can't be worse than trying to do it directly in html? so much of it is duplicate work
[22:17:06] <sinequanon> so...what's your question? trying to show/hide a details pane, or dynamically create a form?
[22:17:30] <Uhkis> i bet there's more than 10 plugins to dynamically create forms
[22:18:05] <P0rk> Uhkis, most of them just create a simple field format. I have looked at hundreds...most are field validation bs
[22:19:14] <P0rk> basically, there are about 10 standards in the alcoholism/drug addiction industry. The questions are pedantic and overlap. I am combining them into one form that gives results for all the tests
[22:20:40] <P0rk> it would be 100 pages long if for every drug you had to answer every question. Then for those that don't apply, people are being given questions like: How long have you been addicted to heroin? Do you parents know about your addiction to heroin?
[22:21:18] <P0rk> Answering these is dangerous. No, my parent's don't know about my heroin addiciton....ooops. I mean....
[22:22:53] <sinequanon> we're quickly drifting away from jquery here...
[22:24:32] <sinequanon> P0rk: http://jsfiddle.net/upvwgatz/15/
[22:26:29] <Uhkis> not the for or the last time drug abuse is talked about in here :D

[22:46:13] <Paradisee> hello
[22:46:38] <Paradisee> is there a way to make an element draggable if it is created dinamically?
[22:47:24] <Paradisee> i create the element in this way:
[22:47:25] <Paradisee> http://dpaste.com/3F3HGE2
[22:47:47] <Paradisee> in this case, i have an image, that i take from a json file, but it doesnt matter
[22:48:05] <Paradisee> i have to make all those elements draggable
[22:48:09] <sinequanon> if it's created dynamically, be sure your handler initially targets an element that *does* actually exist in the DOM
[22:48:26] <Paradisee> sinequanon: that's the problem
[22:48:35] <Paradisee> sinequanon: it dosn't appear in the DOM
[22:48:44] <P0rk> can't you initialize the draggable after it's loaded?
[22:48:59] <sinequanon> can you provide your drag handler function?
[22:49:04] <Paradisee> P0rk: like:
[22:49:04] <Paradisee>                 $('.temp').draggable({
[22:49:04] <Paradisee>                     containment: 'parent'
[22:49:04] <Paradisee>                 });
[22:49:22] <P0rk> so long as temp is attached to the dom, why not?
[22:49:32] <sinequanon> yeah
[22:49:33] <Paradisee> P0rk: it isn't attached to the dom
[22:49:40] <sinequanon> wut
[22:49:41] <P0rk> Then it can't be dragged?
[22:49:46] <P0rk> or visible
[22:49:46] <Paradisee> jquery will create those elements
[22:50:01] <P0rk> AFTER jquery attaches them to the dom, then draggable them
[22:50:16] <sinequanon> $(document).on('dragstart', '#container_map img', function() {...});
[22:50:18] <P0rk> You will need to write an imageloader function
[22:50:20] <Paradisee> P0rk: that's what im doing actually....but it's not what i want
[22:50:43] <Paradisee> i mean, i have some other functions...and i want to make all those items with class temp be draggable
[22:50:57] <Paradisee> i don't use those items just in one funciont
[22:51:00] <Paradisee> function
[22:51:06] <P0rk> create an element apply draggable then load the image into it.
[22:51:39] <Paradisee> i will show you the code
[22:51:52] <P0rk> you are gonna have to make a jsfiddle.
[22:51:57] <Paradisee> http://dpaste.com/03CD1GG
[22:52:02] <sinequanon> please do, and don't use dpaste :)
[22:52:36] <Paradisee> the first ajax request, load the data from a json file and put those images into the page
[22:53:05] <Paradisee> if you see the code, there's draggable inside that
[22:53:31] <Paradisee> i just won't repeat that code, cus already use it in the function below
[22:53:45] <P0rk> you need to make an imageloader function and use it like this: var imag=new Image(); var img=$(imag); img.load(function () { then check width to be sure it's loaded)
[22:55:00] <Paradisee> ill provide a fiddle
[22:55:48] <P0rk> and maybe don't make your images draggable, but rather create a container div that is draggable to put them in, then you can make them draggable but empty. Load the images and suddently they work
[22:56:02] <Paradisee> http://jsfiddle.net/Paradisee/hxttz0jx/21/
[22:56:35] <Paradisee> this is the part where i can take the images and drop them inside the container,
[22:56:49] <Paradisee> and im able to drag the dropped images also
[22:57:40] <P0rk> Okay....looks fine...so where's the problem?
[22:58:35] <Paradisee> when i reload the page, "not the fiddle", i read the json file where i can find the positions of each item dropped before, so i can show them in the same position they were dropped
[22:59:45] <Paradisee> so i will have those images in the div, but i need to make them draggable, also i want to be able to drag and drop the items as before the refresh
[23:00:35] <P0rk> so, I am assuming that when I drag the images onto the page, you are storing their locations somewhere, right?
[23:00:40] <P0rk> like in a cookie or database?
[23:01:08] <Paradisee> P0rk: json
[23:01:21] <P0rk> where are you getting the JSON?
[23:01:33] <P0rk> if you reload the page, it has to be loaded from somewhere?
[23:01:36] <Paradisee> i removed it from the fiddle, its useless there :D
[23:02:01] <P0rk> but if I create a JSON object and reload the page, the JSON object disappears.
[23:02:02] <Paradisee> P0rk: simply when i drag and drop an item, i store it to a json file.
[23:02:12] <P0rk> then you load the file via ajax, right?
[23:02:21] <P0rk> so store the lovcation of the elements in the JSON file
[23:02:33] <Paradisee> P0rk: yes, then i reload the page loading all the json
[23:02:56] <P0rk> great. Then all you need is an imageLoader to tell you when the images are loaded
[23:03:02] <Paradisee> i will find all the objects where they were dropped before
[23:03:11] <P0rk> once they are loaded, then you can apply the draggab le function to them
[23:03:45] <Paradisee> P0rk: isnt possible to just make the class 'temp' draggable as global or somewhat?
[23:03:56] <P0rk> NO
[23:04:10] <sinequanon> lol i'm so confused
[23:04:20] <Paradisee> sinequanon: pretty hard to explain :)
[23:04:22] <P0rk> draggable has to be applied to actual elements
[23:04:23] <P0rk> not a class
[23:04:57] <Paradisee> P0rk: well so i can just do the draggable items like i pasted here before
[23:05:09] <Paradisee>                 $('#container_map').append(image)
[23:05:09] <Paradisee>                 $('.temp').draggable({
[23:05:09] <Paradisee>                     containment: 'parent'
[23:05:09] <Paradisee>                 });
[23:05:22] <Paradisee> this when i load the json
[23:05:25] <P0rk> only if all your temps are created at the time you draggable them
[23:05:28] <Paradisee> i mean, each images
[23:06:13] <P0rk> try this: Create 1000 "div.temp" containers. Then load your images into them. The temp containers will be draggable or empty so invisible
[23:07:37] <Paradisee> the problem is that i have to make a function to restore the position of the dropped element, or loaded, when i drag it again...
[23:08:26] <Paradisee> so when i move any item, it will store the position again, and i can be able to refresh the page loading all the items in the right position
[23:11:48] <P0rk> I don't know the draggable event handlers, but here is what I would do:
[23:12:07] <P0rk> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/hxttz0jx/23/
[23:12:20] <Paradisee> P0rk: if you have python installed, you could try it..
[23:12:29] <Paradisee> the code is opensource on my repo
[23:12:57] <Paradisee> https://bitbucket.org/Paradisee/pydomotic/src
[23:13:36] <P0rk> when you first load the page, read your JSON data and get the ID, URL, and POSITION of each image then pass that to the image loader which applies all the settings once it is loaded.
[23:13:40] <Cork> Paradisee: draggable has .serialize()
[23:13:51] <Paradisee> what's that
[23:13:53] <Cork> just do that and store the serialization
[23:14:19] <Cork> bah
[23:14:31] <Cork> sorry it was sortable not draggable
[23:14:51] <Cork> http://api.jqueryui.com/sortable/#method-serialize
[23:15:08] <P0rk> when are you rewriting your initial json data? On each drop event?
[23:15:28] <Paradisee> P0rk: what do you mean
[23:15:48] <P0rk> When you drag these items around, they get new positions, you need to store that somewhere?
[23:16:06] <P0rk> I assume you update the JSON file with the new positions on drop?
[23:16:21] <P0rk> or better yet, have a save button
[23:16:47] <P0rk> then you can reload if you put stuff in the wrong page and it will reload to the last saved version
[23:17:01] <Paradisee> P0rk: basically that's what i do:
[23:17:09] <P0rk> *wrong position, no wrong page...lol
[23:17:29] <P0rk> then all you are missing is the load handler.
[23:17:38] <P0rk> you need to know when the images are done loading.
[23:17:43] <Paradisee> when i drag an item, a store the values of the position where i dropped it, and i send the data via ajax to the json file.
[23:18:06] <P0rk> then, all you need is to know when the images are loaded...then draggable them
[23:18:27] <Paradisee> P0rk: when i drop the image, it is draggable without problem
[23:18:42] <P0rk> but you can't load the page and drop images that aren't loadedx
[23:18:55] <Paradisee> wait.
[23:19:04] <P0rk> when you reload the page, you have NOTHING in it
[23:19:33] <Paradisee> first of all, i have to make possible that when i move the item that i just dropped in another position, it will refresh the json, with the current position
[23:19:36] <Paradisee> how can i do this?
[23:20:17] <P0rk> You will have to keep a list of images and recreate your JSON data each time...
[23:20:25] <Paradisee> reclap:
[23:21:01] <Paradisee> im able to drag and drop an item, and when it has been dropped, it send the data to the json file and store the position value.
[23:21:03] <P0rk> create a function that serializes all of your images and their positions an writes it to your JSON file whenever an element is dropped
[23:21:08] <Paradisee> this works fine ^
[23:21:32] <Paradisee> now, if i drag the item just dropped, it has to refresh the data in the json with the new position
[23:21:34] <P0rk> it stores the position, url, and ID of the image in the JSON file, correct?
[23:21:59] <P0rk> right. So serialize the entire list on every drop
[23:22:31] <Paradisee> P0rk: i just store the values in the json on each drop
[23:22:32] <P0rk> basically, on every drop, create an all new JSON file that just happens to have the same images (except one) as the last JSON file you loaded.
[23:22:40] <Paradisee> but only on the first drop!
[23:22:47] <P0rk> why?
[23:22:56] <P0rk> why not every drop?
[23:23:07] <Paradisee> P0rk: i mean it works with each drop
[23:23:26] <Paradisee> when i drop a new image, i store the values
[23:23:34] <Paradisee> but not when i change the position of it
[23:23:42] <Paradisee> that's what i need to do
[23:23:43] <P0rk> why not?
[23:23:52] <P0rk> SO JUST DO IT WHENEVER ANY IMAGE IS DROPPED
[23:23:54] <Paradisee> P0rk: cus im still working on it?
[23:24:13] <Paradisee> P0rk: yes but i have to check the id in the json file to make it possible
[23:24:19] <P0rk> then new images trigger the new JSON file as well as old images
[23:24:30] <P0rk> not if you recreate the JSON file every time
[23:24:34] <P0rk> then it doesn't matter
[23:24:44] <Paradisee> i wont recreate the json again
[23:24:50] <Paradisee> its an overkill
[23:25:00] <P0rk> Than you are screwed.
[23:25:17] <Paradisee> wut
[23:25:22] <Paradisee> why
[23:26:09] <Paradisee> there's no need to recreate the json file when i move an item already dropped
[23:26:20] <Paradisee> specially if i have lot of items
[23:26:24] <P0rk> not unless you want to remember where it goes
[23:26:47] <P0rk> how do you expect to remember the new position if you don't store it somewhere?
[23:26:56] <Paradisee> i just need to find the id element in the json and change the position value of it
[23:27:06] <P0rk> so you should do a test.
[23:27:30] <P0rk> see how long it takes to reserialize your images and simply write a new JSON file each time there's a change
[23:27:38] <Paradisee> i don't think recreating the json is a good idea
[23:27:48] <Paradisee> got clients 2 mins
[23:27:53] <P0rk> and see how long it takes to lookup a record in the JSON file change it, rewrite the json file
[23:28:23] <P0rk> the difference will be negligible until you get around 10000 images, most likely
[23:33:38] <Paradisee> P0rk: where does the code go?
[23:33:55] <Paradisee> http://dpaste.com/03CD1GG
[23:40:16] <P0rk> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/hxttz0jx/25/
[23:40:40] <P0rk> This allows you to load your images and then once loaded, apply the draggable to them
[23:41:01] <P0rk> if you don't do it this way, you won't know when the images get loaded so you can't draggable them
[23:41:29] <P0rk> but maybe it's even easier if they are allclones
[23:42:40] <P0rk> in fact, there's an image loading error that IE has where you have to check the image.complete html property....hold on.
[23:44:07] <P0rk> better...http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/hxttz0jx/26/
[23:47:21] <P0rk> In fact, if all of your markers are the same, just store the position data and clone the element. It should clone the draggable as well.
