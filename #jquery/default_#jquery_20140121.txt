[00:01:13] <krenner> I have 3 problems, please take a look http://i.imgur.com/L2VFisO.png
[00:01:21] <krenner> Have you any idea?
[00:01:42] <Cork> 1. please ask the questions in the channel
[00:01:52] <Cork> 2. if it is code problems show code not images
[00:02:09] <krenner> no, it isn't code problem.
[00:03:12] <Uhkis> imo that picture was worth a lot of irc lines which would've ended in showing that picture anyways
[00:03:20] <krenner> 1) when i open dialog dialog with long title it's abbreviated and auto sized to content. i need it auto sized to content and title to avoid abbreiation....
[00:03:29] <krenner> Uhkis, yes. it's true
[00:04:01] <Cork> Uhkis: the question in the channel doesn't need to be explicit
[00:04:10] <Cork> but it needs to explain the general area of the question
[00:04:27] <Cork> so ppl can quickly check if they are likely to have an answer
[00:05:13] <krenner> 2) when i open few dialogs they are located in the same place. Is it possible to open them with padding to see all titlebars?
[00:06:03] <krenner> 3) when there is much content on site and scroll appears dialog seems to open not in center but below and part of dialog content isn't visible
[00:06:52] <Cork> http://api.jqueryui.com/dialog/#option-position
[00:07:10] <Cork> about the stacking, no i don't know of any support in ui dialog for stacking
[00:07:54] <Cork> about the title sounds like something new
[00:08:12] <Cork> check if the abbreviation is done in js or css
[00:08:35] <Cork> if it's done in css it would be easy to disable
[00:08:44] <Cork> if it isn't, then... not sure you can control it
[00:12:56] <xqo> what is the jquery map file for?
[00:12:57] <krenner> Cork,  position: "center"  haven't changed anything. Dialog is still cut from bottom. But it gaves me idea to write piece of code for stacking dialogs and positioning so i will try to deal with it
[00:16:52] <renierdebruyn> Hi there... how would I make `new Date("11-1-2013 02:00:00")` a valid DateTime string? I am getting a JSON error that "11-1-2013 02:00:00" is not a valid DateTime String
[00:17:52] <Cork> you would have to convert it to yyyy-nn-ddTHH:mm:ss<timezone>
[00:18:24] <renierdebruyn> Thanks :)
[00:18:30] <Cork> js> print(new Date('2014-01-21T15:15:30Z'))
[00:18:35] <b-ot> Cork: Invalid Date
[00:18:39] <Cork> uh...
[00:18:47] <Cork> is that bot totally nuts??
[00:19:16] <Cork> it is...
[00:20:57] <renierdebruyn> Cork: Are you saying the date is indeed invalid?
[00:21:09] <Cork> renierdebruyn: no i'm saying the bot is broken
[00:21:16] <Cork> or if you meant your date
[00:21:17] <Cork> yes
[00:21:26] <Cork> it isn't valid in browsers date parsing
[00:21:48] <Cork> or rather it isn't valid cross browsers
[00:22:29] <renierdebruyn> Thanks for your help...
[00:23:21] <Cork> renierdebruyn: iso8601 and us dates is the only ones supported as far as i know
[00:24:10] <Cork> and iso8601 isn't fully supported either
[00:24:19] <renierdebruyn> I did not know that...  haha... Learn something new every day :)
[00:24:25] <Cork> as 2014-01-21 15:15:30Z isn't parsed in browsers as a valid date
[00:48:53] <anli_> Can I test run my app in a webpage that looks like a phone?
[00:50:34] <fabioportieri> what?
[01:07:20] <xqo> when defining objects, do you need var?
[01:07:28] <xqo> dictionary = {"test":1}
[01:07:31] <xqo> var dictionary = {"test":1}
[01:07:33] <xqo> which?
[01:07:37] <Cork> xqo: what you put in them doesn't matter
[01:07:44] <Cork> when you define a variable you need var
[01:07:59] <xqo> so.. the last one?
[01:08:00] <Cork> when you modify a value kept in a variable you don't use var
[01:08:02] <Cork> yes
[01:08:31] <Cork> xqo: the first one is the same as window.dictionary = {"test":1}
[01:08:39] <Cork> xqo: also you don't need "" around keys
[01:09:08] <xqo> but you need "" when looking up values?
[01:09:11] <xqo> dictionary["test"]?
[01:09:24] <Cork> dictionary.test
[01:09:40] <xqo> ok thank you.
[01:10:18] <xqo> what about when defining new values
[01:10:30] <xqo> dictionary.new = 1; or dictionary[new] = 1
[01:10:30] <xqo> ?
[01:10:48] <Cork> second isn't valid
[01:10:55] <Cork> dictionary["new"] = 1
[01:11:10] <xqo> ok, and that is how i should define new values?
[01:11:17] <xqo> not .new?
[01:11:22] <Cork> both works
[01:12:07] <xqo> what if i wanted to set a variable as the key
[01:12:45] <xqo> var x = "test"; dict[x] = 1;
[01:12:59] <xqo> dict.x = 1; would not work, would it? that would make dict["x"]
[01:13:04] <Cork> exactly
[01:14:26] <intermission1> Can someone please help  http://jsfiddle.net/G34jD/6/
[01:14:46] <Cork> intermission1: please ask the question in the channel
[01:15:20] <Cork> else ppl has to load the url before they can tell if they know something about the question
[01:16:03] <intermission1> in the "pagebeforechange" event, I need to figure out what link was clicked
[01:16:18] <Cork> (related to jqm)
[01:16:22] <intermission1> yes
[01:16:24] <fabioportieri> intermission1: $("a[href='#page2']").attr("data-foo")
[01:16:31] <donmatthew> (y)
[01:18:31] <intermission1> ok, but what if I don't know what link it was?
[01:18:59] <fabioportieri> then omit the [href part
[01:19:17] <Anticom> hi all
[01:19:56] <intermission1> Isn't there a way to access the element that triggered the "pagebeforechange" event???
[01:20:09] <Anticom> what's the most elegant way to complete this code? http://jsfiddle.net/zR78R/ I want the left and right arrow to increment/decrement the index of the selected option in #dates. but stop if i'm on the very top or bottom, so that it does NOT rotate
[01:21:02] <anli_> Why is #jquerymobile invite only? Anyone that knows?
[01:21:15] <bill_> hello! can anyone point me to somewhere I can learn how to access the twitter api to fetch tweets nowadays? I've looked around quite a bit but haven't found the way to do it yet
[01:21:49] <Anticom> bill_ http://lmgtfy.com/?q=jquery+twitter+plugin
[01:22:43] <Anticom> bill_ "twitter api docs" is also a great one ;)
[01:25:22] <bill_> Anticom: thanks, I'll check it out. I don't think the docs are very clear on how to actually implement it :)
[01:25:47] <Anticom> bill_ depends on what you wanna do
[01:26:21] <Cork> Anticom: http://jsfiddle.net/zR78R/1/
[01:26:32] <Anticom> https://dev.twitter.com/docs/api/1.1 for me this looks like a great documentation
[01:26:40] <Anticom> oh hey Cork :)
[01:26:44] <Anticom> How r u?
[01:27:00] <bill_> Anticom: hahaha! nice site. haven't seen it before. I want to fetch, style and print it all myself, not just an iframe widget that displays them for me
[01:27:03] <Cork> busy. but other then that, just fine
[01:27:22] <Anticom> Cork, did NOT want it to rotate, but think i'm gonna get this fixed myself
[01:27:37] <Cork> Anticom: then you just need to remove the if cases :)
[01:27:39] <Anticom> Cork hope you didn't forgett about the beer i promised you hahaha
[01:27:55] <Anticom> in Feb I'm in UK. Maybe next year i'll make it somewhat more into the north :P
[01:28:14] <Cork> heh
[01:28:27] <bill_> That doc is awesome once you've gained access to the api
[01:28:40] <bill_> but that's what I don't know how to do :(
[01:28:58] <intermission1> Ok, so after a bit of research it looks like determining the caller of "pagebeforechange" is not possible. LAME!!!!
[01:30:08] <Cork> intermission1: you might be able to do something based on the focused element?
[01:30:21] <Anticom> bill_ you need an API key, then you can mess arround with it
[01:30:30] <intermission1> Cork: I don't know what that means
[01:30:33] <Anticom> intermission1 what you wanna do?
[01:30:41] <Cork> ?mdn activeElement
[01:30:43] <b-ot> Cork: document.activeElement - Mozilla Developer Network → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/document.activeElement
[01:31:06] <Cork> warning though i don't know much about jqm so they might do something that breaks that
[01:31:39] <intermission1> I just need to access the link element's data attributes when "pagebeforechange" is fired, so I can determine what to inject into the target page.
[01:31:56] <Cork> intermission1: the event isn't fired by an element
[01:32:04] <bill_> Anticom: is it the widget id you get when creating one from your widget page on twitter?
[01:32:06] <Cork> its fired cause the page is about to be unloaded
[01:32:34] <Anticom> bill_ dunno, just gave you the google query. You've got to read the docs yourself
[01:32:44] <Anticom> I've never used those plugins
[01:32:45] <Cork> intermission1: well that and as a callback from ajax
[01:32:59] <Cork> so none of them knows anything about what caused the situation
[01:33:31] <intermission1> The jqm tutorial shows how to dynamically inject pages using the url parameters, but I was hoping to avoid that
[02:30:00] <techouse> is there any way for $.ajax not to wait for the success response?
[02:30:17] <Cork> techouse: it doesn't by default
[02:30:21] <techouse> since i'm gonna be triggering a long mysql query
[02:30:24] <techouse> really?
[02:30:29] <techouse> so just leave success out?
[02:30:39] <Cork> no
[02:30:46] <Cork> success doesn't cause it to wait for it
[02:30:59] <techouse> ah...
[02:31:02] <Cork> the callback is called asynchronously
[02:31:09] <techouse> ah, true
[03:01:44] <enzo> Hello
[03:02:43] <enzo> I have an object {"name": 'k', "value": 1} (for ajax), how can I transform it into a string for GTE query ? (k=1 in that example)
[03:03:35] <enzo> hum, gonna try .param() indeed
[03:31:18] <sammych> okay. I wanna know how jQuery UI Accordion does the auto height
[03:32:06] <sammych> I'm trying to roll my own accordion but I won't be able to determine the height of the content if the user has resized the window
[03:32:18] <sammych> so that I can't animate it back to that height
[03:36:34] <enzo> I have a dom element, how can I know if the onclick is handled or not ? (it may be added by a $(tag).on('click', function () {....}) )
[03:38:18] <doitux_> Hi, i'am unable to theme my jquery mobile loader animation with 1.3.1. It is always the default one. Is this a known issue?
[03:40:27] <Hellothere> hey there bros  http://jsfiddle.net/cVv66/ this works fine with opera chrome etc... but IE  bugs big time...
[03:41:14] <Hellothere> it is just skipping the If in IE and its just reloads the page for some reason...
[03:48:08] <Hellothere> anyone around?
[03:49:51] <GoSox> i'm a little confused. How can I insert a piece of text (which happens to be an <li>, into a list, but i want the list item to be invisible, and then animate its appearance.
[03:58:10] <h4k1m> hello guys
[03:58:28] <h4k1m> can I ask a question about jqueryUI tabs here?
[04:00:48] <Hellothere> IE SUX !
[04:00:59] <Hellothere> people should gather and burn IE in a public place !
[04:01:20] <GoSox> IE traffic on whatsmyip.org, not counting the obsolete subdomain, is down to 5%
[04:01:44] <Hellothere> bro IE sux ...
[04:01:55] <Hellothere> i fix things they work fine with EVERYTHING! but IE ..
[04:02:05] <Hellothere> always always always it has to be IE not recognizing shit
[04:02:27] <GoSox> what versions of IE are you working with?
[04:02:31] <GoSox> try abandoning more versions
[04:02:42] <Hellothere> and the worst shit of all is that 90% of corporations are using IE especially IE 7-9 which is shit! so when u target those people that cant download something else in their computer its done..
[04:02:47] <Hellothere> u cant bro
[04:02:53] <Hellothere> i am working in a bank enviroment
[04:03:18] <Hellothere> 90% of people around use the default IE 7 - 8 that comes with their IT locked computer :D
[04:03:18] <GoSox> theres no reason they can'e upgrade, and not use obsolete browsers
[04:03:32] <GoSox> thats a problem with the IT department
[04:03:51] <Hellothere> no mate cause the IT wont go and download anything that is out of the Windows or its not bought
[04:03:52] <Cork> GoSox: also ie9 isn't supported on winxp
[04:03:53] <Hellothere> thats their job
[04:03:59] <Cork> and there are A LOT of users on winxp
[04:04:22] <GoSox> whatsmyip.org gets a lot of traffic
[04:04:24] <BinaryKitten> which support for finally expires in April
[04:04:27] <GoSox> and there is very little IE left
[04:04:31] <h4k1m> is there a way to use jqueryui tabs for two divs not at the same level?
[04:04:31] <Cork> BinaryKitten: not fully sadly
[04:04:34] <Hellothere> the job of an IT guy in a massive corp is to create an Image with the original Software + software that the company uses )
[04:04:38] <GoSox> i' haven't supported IE8 and below in a long time
[04:04:46] <Cork> BinaryKitten: they extended the security updates to 2015
[04:04:54] <BinaryKitten> when>
[04:04:54] <GoSox> Hellothere: so put a modern web browser on that image so the internet is useable
[04:05:09] <Hellothere> They wont do it, if u were IT in a bank would u do it?
[04:05:27] <Hellothere> if u were IT on jpmorgan, would u put a new browser in?
[04:05:43] <BinaryKitten> ah Cork small difference
[04:05:46] <GoSox> if we had intranet crap that needed old IT, i'd make Chrome or Firefox the default browser, and hide IE on there for internal use only
[04:06:06] <Cork> BinaryKitten: well, sure, but it is enough support that ppl won't move away from it
[04:06:06] <BinaryKitten> the Security Essentials for XP will continue with support til 2015.
[04:06:07] <anli_> I am searching for a good kendoui forum...
[04:06:15] <Hellothere> Ye and the next day ud be at home with a lawsuit of 1 million pounds gosox
[04:06:23] <BinaryKitten> not corporate support ..
[04:06:29] <BinaryKitten> which is what it has til april
[04:06:35] <GoSox> being sued for doing my job, competently?
[04:06:42] <Cork> BinaryKitten: they had to pull ppl away from win98 with every thing they had
[04:06:44] <beancurd> anli_: wouldn't you go through official telerik support forums?
[04:06:49] <Cork> and that was after removing all support
[04:06:56] <BinaryKitten> yep.
[04:07:02] <BinaryKitten> agreed there will be idiots
[04:07:04] <Hellothere> gosox belive me ur contract as an IT in a massive corp says that u have to buy eveyrthing etc, go by the rules etc
[04:07:04] <anli_> beancurd: they are not open, it seems
[04:07:07] <Cork> so ya, winxp will live for another year
[04:07:09] <Hellothere> no freeware etc
[04:07:12] <Cork> and with that ie8
[04:07:21] <Hellothere> so the ybuy windows for u and comes with IE7 thats what ull use :)
[04:07:29] <BinaryKitten> at least ie8 isn't all that bad
[04:07:39] <Hellothere> ull try implement something on ur own, they gonna say why? and then why goes to this guy does his own things
[04:07:42] <Cork> well it isn't super good either
[04:07:46] <GoSox> ok well then i would never work for that company
[04:08:03] <Hellothere> Cork: do u know why http://jsfiddle.net/cVv66/ it will skip the if statement does a reload in IE7-8 ?
[04:08:50] <GoSox> i use jquery 2 on whatsmyip.org
[04:09:02] <GoSox> IE8 and below, get redirected to obsolete.whatsmyip.org
[04:09:06] <ndeeah_> does anyone have any expertise in combining superscrollorama with timelinemax?
[04:09:12] <GoSox> the html4, CSS-free mini site
[04:11:01] <Uruk> Hello, I have a for() loop that dispatches several different async calls; is there a way to wire a callback to be executed after they are all completed (i.e. after the last/slowest async call has finished)?
[04:13:21] <Cork> Hellothere: cause it would always not be exactly true
[04:13:26] <Cork> no matter what browser it is
[04:13:43] * Cork feels he has answered this before...
[04:13:59] <Cork> Hellothere: if the label exists you get an array of the element it matched
[04:14:09] <Cork> Hellothere: if it doesn't you get an empty array
[04:14:23] <Cork> Hellothere: so if(err.length > 0) is what you want
[04:15:15] <Cork> Uruk: no cause the for loop has to end before the async calls can execute
[04:15:43] <Cork> Uruk: you would have to replace the for loop with a daisy-chain function loop
[04:16:45] <Uruk> Cork: by daisy chain do you mean write a wrapper function that calls them nested?
[04:17:26] <Uruk> right now I'm doing something like this:   for(var x in struct) { x.fn(); }
[04:17:44] <Cork> function nextItteration(index) { if(index > max) { return } /* do your async call */.callback(function(){ nextItteration(++index); }  } nextItteration(0);
[04:17:55] <Cork> like i said, you can't use for
[04:17:56] <Cork> ever
[04:18:05] <Cork> Uruk: js is single threaded
[04:18:18] <Cork> so if you keep the thread locked in a for loop nothing else can do anything
[04:18:33] <Uruk> gotcha - so that threadedness is the cause of the bug I'm trying to squash
[04:18:44] <Uruk> and yet what's the mechanism for the return val of my async call to have a .callback() member?
[04:18:55] <Cork> not really
[04:19:00] <Cork> it's psudo code
[04:19:10] <Uruk> ok so I need to make the callback() function so
[04:19:12] <Uruk> which I can do
[04:19:16] <Cork> you can just do fn(function() { nextItteration(++index); })
[04:19:16] <GoSox> so when I use this command, the <li> is empty, and the "TEST" part of the string... somehow gets deleted in the process?
[04:19:38] <Cork> but the point is you pass int a function to the async caller (your choice how to do that)
[04:19:44] <Cork> and it executes the next step
[04:19:54] <Uruk> yeah got that part.
[04:20:13] <Cork> GoSox: sounds like you try to add partial html to the dom
[04:20:17] <Uruk> so I can't make multiple async calls go in parallel b/c JS is single threaded?
[04:20:17] <Cork> and that isn't possible
[04:20:31] <Uruk> they needn't be dependent on one another
[04:20:41] <Cork> Uruk: are you using webworkers=
[04:20:43] <Cork> *?
[04:20:49] <Cork> or what threads are you talking about?
[04:20:49] <Uruk> nope - just jQuery
[04:20:54] <Cork> then you don't have threads
[04:20:58] <Uruk> fair enough
[04:22:05] <Uruk> well you've given me the design piece.  Need to puzzle over the exact code for a bit, but you're giving me basically a recursive function that replaces the for loop.  In the base case of the recursive function (no more indexes to call) then I call what I *want* to call when they're all done.  And since JS is single threaded, I know that will get called at the right time and not while some intermed call is still resolving.  Have I got all 
[04:22:33] <Uruk> Hey!  What's the worst that could happen?   I could screw up the base case of the recursion, and blow the stack.  Not like we all haven't done that before.
[04:22:56] <Cork> Uruk: also
[04:23:07] <Hellothere> Cork: u mean on my jsfiddel instead of error!==true it should be error.lenght > 0?
[04:23:22] <Cork> if you arn't event based you MIGHT want to use setTimeout(func) (no time) to flatten the stack
[04:23:38] <Cork> depends on what makes it async
[04:23:49] <Cork> Hellothere: yes
[04:24:08] <Hellothere> it doesnt work realy :S
[04:24:28] <Cork> Hellothere: then please make a full example in jsfiddle
[04:24:41] <Cork> (one that actually have anything to run on)
[04:24:43] <Uruk> so it's different widgets on a page that all need to refresh various data structures.   The final callback needs to wait for them to all be done so that I can not put the code that updates the DOM into the function that dispatches/handles result.  It might be easier if each widget individually updated the right piece of the DOM, but then I sscatter knowledge of the DOM all throughout the code
[04:24:45] <Cork> *has
[04:25:18] <Uruk> there's a summary result which depends on the results of the intermed widgets, so I have to wait for them to all be done.  Progressive updates to the DOM would be a complicated bitch
[04:26:41] <Cork> Uruk: there is plenty of ways to do that
[04:27:04] <Cork> the solution depends on how you've choosen to structure the page
[04:28:12] <mento> hi guys, how can i change the value of my select button based on a hashtag in the url of the page? Say a person clicks the support button on productpage "ProductA"  which links to a support page /support#ProductA - can i automatically select the option "ProductA" in my select dropdown?
[04:28:37] <Uruk> this is structured roughly as a data table; top row is a summary of all ratings below.  Each individual rating below is wired to a RESTful service.   Users add/remove/reconfigure ratings selections, and get a rollup rating.  Most have already run, but when ratings table gets refreshed, it may need to dispatch 1 or more async calls to get the right ratings.   The final callback is the thing that squashes multiple ratings into summary asses
[04:28:48] <Cork> mento: what browsers do you need to support?
[04:29:13] <Cork> Uruk: then you could bind an event listener to the tbody
[04:29:31] <Cork> Uruk: and have each row create a custom event as they change
[04:29:42] <Cork> and then just have the first row listen for those events
[04:30:12] <Uruk> so that's a good idea I had considered, but this requires the ratings code to insert a new <tr> right?  The way I've been building this is trying to keep the ratings code away from having to understand how the DOM works.
[04:30:29] <Uruk> the function that presently computes the summary is the the one that updates the table (or actually a related function)
[04:30:35] <Cork> Uruk: uh not really no
[04:31:14] <Cork> you could have a class of the code (or how ever you structure it)
[04:31:32] <Cork> in the class have a function for notifyUpdates (or what ever
[04:31:48] <Cork> and it just does $(target_row).trigger('updated')
[04:31:58] <Cork> then the dom will do the rest
[04:32:18] <Cork> or rather jquerys wrapper of the dom will do the rest
[04:32:56] <Uruk> need to think about that a bit.  Not sure I fully grok that, but you've given me the breadcrumbs to investigate.  Thanks
[04:33:09] <Cork> np
[04:33:51] <Uruk> it's apparent I need to rethink how a series of functions are intertwined and not just fix the callback issue.   I've been programming for a very long time but I'm relatively new to the tricks people use to wire code to DOM and vice versa
[04:33:53] <mento> Cork: it needs to support all major browsers
[04:34:10] <Cork> mento: and versions?
[04:34:19] <Cork> that was more what i was concerned about
[04:34:37] <mento> Cork: IE 9/10 Chrome, firefox, safari, opera latest
[04:34:42] <Cork> good
[04:34:48] <Cork> ?mdn onhashchange
[04:34:50] <b-ot> Cork: Window.onhashchange - Mozilla Developer Network → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window.onhashchange
[04:35:02] <Cork> if you needed ie7 or older you couldn't depend on that one ^
[04:35:18] <seutje> osnap, BinaryKitten, been a while!
[04:35:31] <BinaryKitten> :p
[04:35:33] <BinaryKitten> always
[04:35:38] <mento> ah oke, good to know - Cork
[04:35:38] <seutje> how u been?
[04:35:45] <BinaryKitten> try to avoid helping people these days...
[04:35:45] <Cork> seutje: good
[04:36:03] <BinaryKitten> </joke>
[04:36:04] <mento> Cork:  thanks, is there a workaround for IE7 if needed?
[04:36:12] <BinaryKitten> more that i don't have any spare time :p
[04:36:15] <Cork> mento: setInterval :/
[04:36:19] <Cork> mento: basically no
[04:36:26] <seutje> suppose that could be considered a good thing :)
[04:36:45] <mento> Cork: Ok, not a real problem at this time though
[04:37:53] <seutje> damned 3rd party services, takes over a day to test things, may as well be rendering 3D shit on a pentium 2
[04:38:20] <seutje> add some google tracking code, check back in 2 days q.q
[04:38:41] <mento> Cork:  thanks for pointing me in the right direction :-)
[04:56:50] <jozefk> o/
[04:58:38] <jozefk> I spent all day long trying to get tooltips with html content working with jquery and I never get it done. anybody got tooltips with at least links inside working with jquery 2.0.3?
[05:08:38] <airdem> hi guys
[05:09:46] <airdem> is there a way to make the call of $.get(...) dynamic? smth like: if (form.method == post) var method = post; else var method = get; $method(...)
[05:11:07] <airdem> or should i just handle how to create data (.serialize() / .serializeArray()) and then just use $.ajax ?
[05:12:54] <Linkandzelda> hey guys, ive got the following jquery function http://pastebin.com/ysSGABj6 and this as the html <td data-group="12" class="order">Cancel</td> but when clcking on it nothing happens. what am i doing wrong?
[05:13:31] <Cork> Linkandzelda: the selector searches for a child of the td
[05:13:37] <Cork> so the td won't match
[05:13:41] <Linkandzelda> ohh
[05:13:45] <Linkandzelda> how do I change that?
[05:13:49] <Cork> replace the td in the selector with table for example
[05:14:21] <Cork> Linkandzelda: if you want to use a delegated listener you most likely want to bind on the table
[05:14:28] <Cork> possibly tbody
[05:14:47] <Linkandzelda> ok, i binded to table but its still not calling it
[05:15:08] <Cork> Linkandzelda: please make a live example in jsfiddle.net
[05:15:33] <Linkandzelda> ok
[05:16:18] <Linkandzelda> Cork http://jsfiddle.net/g5uYP/1/
[05:16:51] <Cork> Linkandzelda: http://jsfiddle.net/g5uYP/2/
[05:16:52] <seutje> Linkandzelda: adding jQuery helps
[05:17:42] <EdwardIII> hey, am i right in thinking that return isn't going all the way back up the stack (line 8)? http://jsfiddle.net/uMm2s/1/
[05:18:09] <Cork> EdwardIII: ajax is async, so no you can't use return
[05:18:37] <EdwardIII> hrm guess i'll need to rethink that bit of ko then
[05:18:57] <Cork> EdwardIII: just move self.result into the callback
[05:20:08] <Linkandzelda> doesnt make sense cork I have jquery as ive got other jquery functions on same page
[05:20:29] <Cork> Linkandzelda: it meas the problem isn't in this code
[05:20:38] <Cork> it is something else in your code that breaks
[05:20:53] <Cork> aka. look somewhere else :)
[05:22:12] <Linkandzelda> is there any way to debug this?
[05:22:56] <Cork> Linkandzelda: hard to say without seeing all the flow
[05:23:33] <Cork> Linkandzelda: one of the causes might be that table doesn't exist when the event listener is added?
[05:23:55] <Cork> if so then you need to use a parent that always exist
[05:24:00] <TheJHNZ> is there a show toggle ?
[05:24:04] <Linkandzelda> Cork: why would that be? im adding my js file at the header liek normal, right?
[05:24:14] <Cork> ?api toggle @ TheJHNZ
[05:24:14] <b-ot> TheJHNZ: .toggle(): Display or hide the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/toggle/
[05:24:33] <Cork> Linkandzelda: if the table is added ex. though ajax
[05:24:47] <Cork> then head will run before the table is added to the page
[05:25:30] <ravenzz> EdwardIII in addition to what Cork suggested you can also do this http://jsfiddle.net/uMm2s/2/
[05:25:55] <Linkandzelda> Cork: i get the issue, adding it in the header fails bevecuase no elemnts exist
[05:25:57] <Cork> watch out with bind in cross browser though
[05:26:01] <Linkandzelda> that sounds like a major flaw to me
[05:26:05] <ravenzz> yep
[05:26:22] <Cork> Linkandzelda: well ya, depends on what adds it
[05:26:31] <Linkandzelda> its a static page
[05:26:34] <Linkandzelda> generated by php
[05:26:40] <Cork> Linkandzelda: no ajax load at all?
[05:26:48] <Linkandzelda> none
[05:26:59] <Cork> then no that most likely isn't it
[05:27:11] <Linkandzelda> it was it
[05:27:28] <Cork> then it is added dynamically
[05:27:28] <Linkandzelda> i moved the script to inline as the as a head script
[05:27:30] <Linkandzelda> it failed
[05:27:39] <Cork> uh.
[05:27:44] <Linkandzelda> moved it to the bottom of the page
[05:27:45] <Linkandzelda> it owrked
[05:27:51] <Linkandzelda> this page is static
[05:27:53] <Cork> it works at the top of body?!?
[05:28:01] <Linkandzelda> no only at the bottom
[05:28:04] <Cork> ah
[05:28:07] <Linkandzelda> after body has finished
[05:28:14] <Cork> Linkandzelda: uh... you are using .ready right?
[05:28:25] <Linkandzelda> well, i dont think so lol
[05:28:29] <Cork> else you will access the dom before it is parsed
[05:28:36] <Cork> that kinda explains it
[05:28:42] <Cork> ?api ready
[05:28:42] <b-ot> Cork: .ready(): Specify a function to execute when the DOM is fully loaded. http://api.jquery.com/ready/
[05:28:45] <Linkandzelda> hehe, you saw my function
[05:28:59] <Cork> well i expected it to be a small part of what you used
[05:29:19] <Linkandzelda> sorry i should have been clearer
[05:29:30] <Cork> no, i shouldn't have assumed :)
[05:29:42] <Cork> it is a quite common mistake
[05:29:50] <Cork> i just haven't hit it in a while ^^'
[05:30:17] <Linkandzelda> hehe i dont use jquery often
[05:30:35] <TheJHNZ> is there a function for clicking away ?
[05:31:06] <TheJHNZ> like clicking anywhere but somewhere..
[05:31:10] <TheJHNZ> like for a meny
[05:31:38] <Linkandzelda> $( document ).ready(function() {
[05:31:38] <Linkandzelda>   // Handler for .ready() called.
[05:31:38] <Linkandzelda> });
[05:31:42] <Linkandzelda> this example
[05:31:47] <Linkandzelda> i put my code inside?
[05:33:13] <Cork> Linkandzelda: yes
[05:33:23] <Cork> TheJHNZ: you always have to target an element
[05:33:26] <Linkandzelda> idnt work ;-;
[05:48:21] <madskonradsen_> I think i found a bug, only showing up in FF, with the .on method, what to do?
[05:50:01] <fabioportieri> explain it to the channel, preferably with a working example
[05:50:02] <Cork> madskonradsen_: show an example to start with
[05:50:17] <Cork> jsfiddle.net is a good start
[05:50:25] <madskonradsen_> I just created a fiddle with the three lines: http://jsfiddle.net/Kz9AF/
[05:50:58] <madskonradsen_> Is it night, in the states, since that channel is so quiet? :P
[05:51:37] <mobile8> anyone ever used masonry with percentages?
[05:51:37] <Cork> madskonradsen_: and what is the bug?
[05:51:42] <madskonradsen_> The three lines works perfect in Safari and Chrome, but FF complains..
[05:51:52] <madskonradsen_> The console.log doesn't get executed in FF
[05:51:54] <Cork> madskonradsen_: and why are you delegating the same object?
[05:52:05] <Anticom> HAHAHAHA take a look at this readme.md https://github.com/occ/TraceKit :D
[05:52:17] <Cork> madskonradsen_: for the touchmove specifically?
[05:52:22] <Cork> scroll works just fine here
[05:52:42] <madskonradsen_> yeah it scrolls, but the console log doesn't get executed in FF
[05:53:00] <madskonradsen_> i could also write the following, but still with the same result: $(document).on('scroll touchmove', "body", function() {
[05:53:01] <Cork> "Look ma', I'm scrolling" show:22 <--
[05:53:04] <Cork> works just fine here
[05:53:06] <madskonradsen_> IN FF?
[05:53:16] <Cork> Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:26.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/26.0
[05:53:29] <madskonradsen_> LOL!
[05:53:35] <madskonradsen_> what the
[05:53:37] <madskonradsen_> it works now
[05:53:40] <madskonradsen_> but
[05:53:42] <madskonradsen_> sigh
[05:54:01] <Cork> so ok with the ruling: not a bug? :D
[05:54:10] <madskonradsen_> Indeed :D
[05:54:15] <madskonradsen_> thanks :D
[05:54:27] <Cork> though i must say i find $(document).on('event', document, really strange
[05:54:38] <Cork> why the delegate when you don't want delegate?
[05:55:03] <Cork> actually i'm a bit surprised it works at all
[05:56:25] <koneko> I think it's checking the target, so at some point of the event traversal the current target is the document
[05:56:53] <Cork> koneko: yes
[05:57:05] <Cork> and document isn't a child of document
[05:57:05] <koneko> But it's not really useful
[05:57:14] <Cork> so i don't see how it works in this case
[05:57:50] <koneko> Well maybe it checks with the element the event is attached to as well, not only child elements
[05:58:03] <Cork> it doesn't
[05:58:07] <koneko> Hm
[05:58:12] <Cork> it might be an exeption for document
[05:58:17] <Cork> only solution i can think of
[05:58:33] <Cork> if that code was anything other then document it wouldn't work
[05:58:57] <Cork> ah... wait
[05:59:09] <Cork> of course
[05:59:17] <Cork> if the target argument is an element
[05:59:25] <Cork> it just does event.target == target
[05:59:29] <Cork> so it will work
[05:59:37] <Cork> kinda broken and over coded but it would work
[06:01:12] <madskonradsen_> Okay, now i really think i found the bug i was looking for! .css("padding") is supposed to return the current padding right? Safari and Chrome returns 20px, and FF returns "" http://jsfiddle.net/Kz9AF/1/
[06:02:21] <Cork> madskonradsen_: no
[06:02:25] <madskonradsen_> w00t
[06:02:29] <Cork> cause you want computed style
[06:02:33] <Cork> not the style set on the element
[06:02:37] <Cork> css is what is inline
[06:03:05] <madskonradsen_> what srsly? i thought .css returned the computed?
[06:03:41] <Cork> though that said this one is strange http://jsfiddle.net/Kz9AF/3/
[06:09:36] <Cork> madskonradsen_: looks like you might have found a bug in firefox though http://jsfiddle.net/Kz9AF/4/
[06:09:49] <Cork> interestingly one i haven't ever seen before...
[06:09:52] <madskonradsen_> YES!
[06:09:55] <madskonradsen_> MY FIRST JQUERY BUG!
[06:09:58] <Cork> no
[06:10:02] <madskonradsen_> aaw
[06:10:02] <Cork> in firefox not jquery
[06:10:07] <madskonradsen_> damn
[06:10:12] <Cork> the browser says "no pading"
[06:10:21] <Cork> and jquery just accepts what firefox says
[06:10:53] <fabioportieri> Cork: to me it prints 20px
[06:10:54] <Cork> so you have left, right, top and bottom
[06:10:58] <Cork> but no the shorthand
[06:11:05] <Cork> fabioportieri: in ff?
[06:11:15] <madskonradsen_> Mine says 20px 7 times
[06:11:20] <Cork> interesting
[06:11:23] <fabioportieri> Cork: ah no, you were right
[06:12:03] <fabioportieri> version 26
[06:12:31] <madskonradsen_> v26 OSX here
[06:13:23] <Cork> madskonradsen_: so go file a bug, looks valid here
[06:13:23] <fabioportieri> win7
[06:13:45] <madskonradsen_> Cork... may i be honest... i don't even know how to do it
[06:14:00] <Cork> https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/
[06:14:02] <madskonradsen_> just on the bug tracker?
[06:14:18] <madskonradsen_> I'll try! :)
[06:14:31] <Cork> oh no need
[06:14:44] <Cork> hmm no
[06:14:48] <Cork> an old one https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=63281
[06:15:24] <Cork> madskonradsen_: i'd like the number when you've filed it
[06:16:43] <Cork> madskonradsen_: if you add a testcase to the bug i suggest using native js (meaning no jquery)
[06:17:41] <madskonradsen_> cool... just give me 10 minutes... i have never written a bug report before :P
[06:25:13] <grafi> exiting

[06:41:54] <izolate> sup. anybody know how to select an individual element from a jquery list? In essence need li#required from: var lis = $('li')
[06:42:19] <izolate> would be real nice to do li.select('#required')...
[06:42:52] <izolate> tried lis.is('#required') but that gives me a boolean response
[06:43:09] <Crucials> you mean you have multiple <li> and one of them has id "required"?
[06:43:18] <izolate> yes
[06:43:35] <Crucials> have you tried just $('li#required') ?
[06:43:54] <decx> it's already i var lis, that would be redundant
[06:44:00] <izolate> yes of course that will work, but i'm trying to optimise my code a bit
[06:44:01] <decx> in*
[06:44:13] <Crucials> oh I see now
[06:44:16] <izolate> so ive cached all the <li> in a variable with var lis = $('li')
[06:44:37] <izolate> i'd like to select a specific <li> from that cache
[06:44:57] <izolate> possible?
[06:45:53] <Crucials> i dont know how optimized it would be but maybe .siblings('#required') ?
[06:47:09] <decx> surely document.getelementbyid would be faster than going through the lis array
[06:47:25] <decx> now that i think about it
[06:47:28] <seutje> `api filter
[06:47:28] <b-ot> seutje: .filter(): Reduce the set of matched elements to those that match the selector or pass the function's test.  http://api.jquery.com/filter/
[06:47:36] <seutje> izolate:
[06:47:38] <seutje> ^
[06:47:40] <decx> filter ! right
[06:47:45] <decx> i always forget about filter
[06:47:46] <izolate> ah yes! filter will work. nice
[06:47:51] <izolate> well, thanks
[06:47:59] <seutje> but tbh, if it's an ID, u can drop the element and go straight for $('#required')
[06:48:13] <izolate> that's just as fast?
[06:48:17] <seutje> it'll return a set with only 1 element, as IDs are unique by definition
[06:48:18] <seutje> faster
[06:48:36] <seutje> it gets spun off straight to getElementById, which is about the fastest thing you have available
[06:48:41] <izolate> oh i didn't know that. i'll be using that as priority 1 then
[06:49:03] <izolate> i should really just use gEBI then
[06:49:05] <seutje> $('el#id') is much slower than just $('#id'), as it has to check if both the element and the ID match
[06:49:16] <seutje> but selectors are evaluated from right to left
[06:49:33] <izolate> cool
[06:49:35] <seutje> so it'll go getElementById('id') and then check if that matches the element you specified
[06:50:08] <seutje> general rule of thumb is: if you wanna target based on ID, you only need said ID
[06:50:25] <seutje> unless u wanna go like "gimme all LIs that are inside #foo"
[06:50:57] <izolate> thanks seut. i'll definitely keep this in mind
[06:57:26] <decx> can i target multiple elements with the inverted syntax? so something like $('#mycontainer .myelement') to $('.myelement','#mycontainer'). with $('#mycontainer .myelement, .myunrelatedelement')
[06:58:14] <casaper> I'm about to try to teach me som JQ, but I'm stuck with my tryouts here: http://jsfiddle.net/hCz4D/2/ (just Stuck with selecting generated elements, I don't seem to understand how this is done)
[06:58:17] <airdem> if i do an ajax request and the resulting page redirects somewhere else. how can i get the url i got redirected to?
[06:58:28] <airdem> (php redirect)
[07:00:03] <seutje> decx: $('foo', 'bar') is essentially the same as $('bar').find('foo')
[07:01:27] <airdem> casaper, try to assign the mouseenter event before you append the dt
[07:03:05] <casaper> airdem: but after pageload the dt is apended. so Why can't I add a event for later?
[07:03:16] <airdem> casaper, something like this https://gist.github.com/anonymous/8541693
[07:03:25] <casaper> airdem: thx allot
[07:04:01] <casaper> airdem: I think I have to dig myself into a book instead of playing arround like this ;) Thanks for you're help
[07:04:18] <airdem> learning by doing is usually the best way to get into this kind of stuff
[07:04:20] <airdem> in my opinion
[07:04:31] <decx> it
[07:04:34] <airdem> but there is nothing wrong with reading books :)
[07:04:57] <fabioportieri> agree with airdem
[07:05:46] <casaper> airdem: right, But if I'm just shooting in the dark, kind of, then I maybe refer to a guided manual, instead of parsing the online JQ manual and guess how its done
[07:06:33] <casaper> airdem: but refering to your example: so I need to add the handler before the element is appended, afterwards it is not possible anymore?
[07:06:59] <jeffsmykil> binary to hex using .toString() but preserving leading 0?
[07:07:55] <airdem> casaper, it has something to do with jquery beeing asynchronous i believe
[07:08:19] <airdem> not all commands get executed in a linear order. but maybe i am wrong :)
[07:08:51] <Cork> madskonradsen_: thx
[07:09:20] <casaper> airdem: ah, i cannot count on the dt element allready existing when I try to add the handler to my dt. Possibli it is done to early then. I see
[07:09:27] <casaper> airdem: thx allot
[07:11:22] <shoky> airdem: as far as i remember, you can't get the redirected ajax url
[07:11:44] <Elirips> Hello. I'm using '$(document).trigger("myEvent", "someId")' to trigger an event, in the handler '$(document).on("myEvent, function(event, myId) { ..' I test if myId is "someId" to only work with events I'm interested in. Isn't there a nicer way that would allow me to set the event on the Event-object, and then using $(document).on("myEvent" - some magic argument that will make the event handler to only work if I have "myId" ?
[07:12:05] <Elirips> I mean: "to set the id on the event-object"
[07:13:24] <airdem> casaper, btw http://jqapi.com/ helped me a lot
[07:13:29] <airdem> und still does
[07:13:32] <airdem> *and :)
[07:14:32] <Rgbskills> Hello
[07:14:35] <jedimind> http://kapeli.com/dash is really handy too airdem
[07:15:21] <BillCriswell> Elirips: You need a pass an array or an object.
[07:15:45] <shoky> BillCriswell nah
[07:15:53] <shoky> As of jQuery 1.6.2, single string or numeric argument can be passed without being wrapped in an array.
[07:16:00] <airdem> jedimind, what limitations does the free versin have?
[07:16:14] <jedimind> none from what ive seen
[07:16:18] <Elirips> BillCriswell: Maybe my question was formulated wrong: I dont like that I 99% of event-handlers that are triggered do not care
[07:16:29] <airdem> jedimind, going to check it out, thank yo
[07:16:31] <airdem> *you
[07:16:37] <Elirips> I'm missing a second property, can I really only register for a eventType?
[07:16:48] <airdem> oh it seems its osx only :)
[07:16:53] <Elirips> isnt there something like an eventType + a unique id a handler can be attached to?
[07:17:15] <shoky> .on("myEventUniqueId",   ?
[07:17:21] <Elirips> so the handler listens only for events of the given eventType and the matching source-id?
[07:17:30] <Elirips> shoky: yes, that would be possible
[07:17:34] <Elirips> but its uggly too
[07:17:42] <jedimind> airdem yes, osx only sorry i didnt mention
[07:17:51] <BillCriswell> shoky: For on? Hm.
[07:17:56] <airdem> jedimind, thank you though
[07:17:58] <BillCriswell> I mean .trigger*
[07:18:01] <shoky> BillCriswell for trigger ya
[07:18:41] <BillCriswell> Docs seem like they might need an updatin'
[07:18:42] <Elirips> shoky: something like: .on("EventType", "Source-ID")
[07:19:13] <Elirips> instead of having to do .on("EventType", function(sourceId) { if sourceId != myId return }
[07:20:41] <shoky> Elirips: the Source-ID is just based on where in the code you're triggering it?
[07:20:45] <haleys> There seems to be quite a few world and country jquery/vector based maps, but haven't seen one for individual states for example, like California. Does anyone know if anything like that exists or have experience with a plugin that does that?
[07:21:23] <Elirips> shoky: yes. Look here: http://pastebin.com/80r8vTiy
[07:21:44] <Elirips> I dont like it that it almost all cases it will simply return
[07:21:48] <Elirips> why call the handler in that case
[07:22:06] <Elirips> and not block it already in the event-processing, only send it to the things its interested in
[07:22:08] <shoky> Elirips not sure what those IDs are.. but maybe you just want event delegation?
[07:22:46] <BillCriswell> shoky: That's the vibe I'm getting.
[07:23:12] <Elirips> shoky: indeed, that looks interesting
[07:23:13] <Elirips> thx
[07:23:16] <Elirips> I need to do some reading
[07:23:55] <BillCriswell> Since the string thing isn't documented with the trigger dealie does that mean it can change?
[07:24:51] <shoky> well it's documented, just not on the method signature at the top of the docs
[07:25:33] <BillCriswell> Ah, that's confusing.
[07:27:25] <shoky> yop
[07:29:07] <airdem> var $foo = ...;  how do you call $ ? want to read smth about it
[07:29:25] <airdem> but i cant find anything searching for "javascript $"
[07:29:40] <BillCriswell> airdem: Confused me.
[07:29:53] <airdem> i see some code using $ in front of var names
[07:30:06] <airdem> wonder what its good for
[07:30:19] <BillCriswell> airdem: Some use it to identify that it's a jquery object.
[07:30:42] <BillCriswell> I do that, some people are against it. I like to know the type of variable though.
[07:31:01] <airdem> so its just a usual character like a-z that i can use for var names
[07:31:09] <BillCriswell> Yes.
[07:31:22] <BillCriswell> Javascript has a lot of characters you can use that you'd never expect.
[07:31:28] <airdem> okay, thank you. i thought it meant smth special
[07:32:00] <BillCriswell> Nope. Just a convention.
[07:32:45] <BillCriswell> http://mothereff.in/js-variables good times.
[07:33:12] <airdem> yeah now i remember that i read smth about it
[07:33:13] <airdem> var ಠ_ಠ = eval;
[07:33:15] <airdem> :)
[07:33:33] <airdem> i think im going to implement that somewhere
[07:39:37] <lumia10> hello, I'm new to java script and I try to do this step by step example http://webdeveloperplus.com/jQuery/collpasible-drag-drop-panels/ ... where do I need to place each section of java script code because I can't move my boxes as in their example, and also how do I add correctly jquery and jquery ui to my html ? thanks
[07:43:38] <airdem> you can put all js code into one <script> element. the script element can be anywhere in your html code but common ways are in the <head> or at the end of <body>
[07:45:01] <airdem> jquery and jquery-ui are loaded via <script src="url to .js file">
[07:49:38] <lumia10> thank you, I manage to do it and it works now :) thanks
[07:50:12] <lumia10> it was just jqueryui which I downloaded was a zip file with a lot of files inside and I thought I will need all of them
[07:51:55] <bberry> can i use a 'continue' statement inside a .each?
[07:52:33] <BillCriswell> bberry: Nope. You can just return though I think?
[07:52:41] <BillCriswell> Wait that's dumb.
[07:52:54] <bberry> BillCriswell: lol. yeah i was thinking thatd break out of the .each function
[07:53:09] <shoky> why dumb? return is the way
[07:53:16] <shoky> return false  for "break"
[07:53:48] <lumia10> one more issue, ... http://jsfiddle.net/NrXL8/ ... how do I make when I move a panel to not automatically also close it ?
[07:54:00] <lumia10> for example I drag Handle 2 to the right and to remain open
[07:54:09] <lumia10> and only when I click on header to close it
[07:54:13] <Sal> whats wrong with this: $(this).parent('li').eq(2).addClass('active');
[07:54:13] <BillCriswell> I'm too sick to be programming I think.
[07:54:14] <lumia10> or on a button on header
[07:54:34] <BillCriswell> Sal: parent('li') would only be one element.
[07:54:50] <bberry> shoky: mmk.  so does a .each always run for every single element? or is that what ur saying, to exti completely out of a .each without completing the set, use return false
[07:54:51] <BillCriswell> sO there's no second one to grab.
[07:54:52] <Sal> BillCriswell, oh
[07:55:02] <BillCriswell> Or third... how I don't know that off the top of my head annoys me.
[07:55:06] <Sal> this works: $(this).parent('li').siblings().removeClass('active');
[07:55:11] <shoky> bberry: yeah return false would exit completely
[07:55:17] <Sal> so i was thinking that it move the pointer
[07:55:20] <bberry> shoky: cool, thanks
[07:55:24] <BillCriswell> Sal: Yeah, .siblings() returns a few.
[07:55:50] <Sal> how can i poit to the n element of the parent list?
[07:55:51] <BillCriswell> .parent('li') return one li, .parent('li').siblings() would return all sibling lis.
[07:55:56] <Sal> poit=point
[07:56:22] <Sal> oh, so should i add eq() after sibilings() ?
[07:56:32] <BillCriswell> I think that should be ok?
[07:56:40] <Sal> great, let me try
[07:56:42] <Sal> thanks
[07:56:50] <BillCriswell> I'd probably do .closest('ul').find('li').eq(2) though. Not sure on the order of the nodes if you use sibling.
[07:56:56] <BillCriswell> I might be thinking about it too hard.
[07:58:13] <BillCriswell> Siblings probably wouldn't return the one you're currently on, so I think the pproach I suggested might be safest.
[07:59:00] <Sal> ok, let me see
[08:04:43] <Sal> its almost working
[08:05:06] <Sal> i have a data- value on the <li> elem. that is data-face="0"
[08:05:37] <Sal> but it doesn't enter this: if ($(this).data('face') != "") {
[08:05:50] <Sal> does jquery convert zero to ""  ???
[08:12:00] <BillCriswell> Sal: Do console.log($(this).data('face')) and make sure it's what you think it is.
[08:13:22] <Sal> BillCriswell, it returns 0
[08:13:26] <Sal> correct value
[08:13:58] <BillCriswell> What about if( $(this).data('face') !== 0 ) ?
[08:14:09] <Sal> let me try
[08:14:58] <Sal> if( $(this).data('face') !== "" ) works
[08:15:23] <Sal> i still don't know the difference between == and === or != and !==
[08:15:33] <Sal> but now its working
[08:15:40] <Sal> thanks
[08:16:19] <BillCriswell> It means type and value, like 1 == '1' is true but 1 === '1' is false.
[08:17:47] <Sal> thanks
[08:18:04] <Rgbskills> Someone help me out with this character counter here: http://jsfiddle.net/halirgb/hNn5b/19/
[08:18:15] <Rgbskills> it should give 21 but it gives 30
[08:18:24] <BillCriswell> I think if( $(this).data('face') > -1 ){ } would be your best bet though Sal.
[08:19:50] <BillCriswell> Rgbskills: You have <div> instead of </div>.
[08:20:16] <BillCriswell> So the div you were trying to count was counting all the white space after the second <div>.
[08:20:45] <BillCriswell> Snow is coming down pretty good. MIght be home time soon.
[08:21:51] <BillCriswell> Rgbskills: Usually good habit to $.trim() text as well. I never trust text nodes...
[08:27:44] <Rgbskills> the problem was that i didint close the div properley ... Dumb me... this works: $("#characters").html().length
[08:27:56] <Rgbskills> Thanks new mirc friend of mine!
[08:27:59] <Rgbskills> :)
[08:28:12] <Rgbskills> last time i was in a mirc room i was 10
[08:28:50] <BillCriswell> No problem!
[08:30:35] <decx> when all my minified js is just 20kb gzipped it doesn't make sense to externalize js files for specific pages is it?
[08:31:11] <decx> *does it
[08:32:20] <zumba_addict> is it true folks that in IE9, PUT and DELETE is not supported?
[08:34:16] <BillCriswell> decx: I wouldn't worry about it. I prefer a few larger files over a bunch of tiny ones. HTTP requests are expensive.
[08:34:59] <BillCriswell> ... on mobile*
[08:35:16] <decx> BillCriswell well that's what i always thought. but the consensus seems to be moving towards pagespecific includes
[08:35:50] <decx> but for 20kb the extra requests aren't worth it
[08:35:57] <decx> imo
[08:36:08] <BillCriswell> I agree.
[08:37:02] <BillCriswell> decx: http://www.igvita.com/slides/2013/breaking-1s-mobile-barrier.pdf was a great read if you're interested.
[08:37:22] <MyCraft> Hello
[08:37:27] <decx> wasnt that on hackernews a few weeks ago? ^^
[08:38:11] <BillCriswell> I'm sure I picked it up from there, but it was way more than a few weeks ago haha
[08:38:58] <decx> it's a nice technical overview
[08:48:27] <mvpgraff> I'm trying to make the div height change based on a click. http://jsfiddle.net/r2xuV/ what am I doing wrong?
[08:48:42] <xqo> is this a valid line? 	this.windows = {this.statusWindow._id:this.statusWindow};
[08:49:03] <mvpgraff> It works if I attribute it to just all anchor clicks vs a selected anchor . _ .
[08:49:26] <duch_kazatel> mvpgraff $('#results') - that targets an ID, not an href.
[08:49:33] <mvpgraff> oops
[08:51:01] <mvpgraff> duch_kazatel, sorry forgot to add that, still doesn't work if I target that specific id
[08:51:11] <duch_kazatel> mvpgraff updated fiddle?
[08:51:12] <decx> you have to include jquery
[08:51:27] <duch_kazatel> because the fiddle I'm looking at doesn't have an ID.  and yeah, you need to include jquery in there, too.
[08:51:31] <mvpgraff> nvm
[08:51:32] <mvpgraff> :l
[08:51:35] <mvpgraff> I'm stupid
[08:51:35] <mvpgraff> thanks
[08:52:36] <decx> i've been there.. "why does this fiddle not work..." ... oh
[08:54:17] <mvpgraff> : P
[08:55:06] <johnkpaul> test
[08:55:12] <mvpgraff> Welp, this is why I love communities, I have 100's of eyes ;p
[08:55:28] <michael_benin> test 2
[09:09:08] <lenswipe> hey guys
[09:12:32] <Stephen> Anyone know of a .json file sitting on the jquery cdn or domain?
[09:12:42] <duch_kazatel> Stephen huh?
[09:12:58] <Stephen> Im writing a JS test
[09:13:13] <Stephen> And I can't test ajax calls against a local file
[09:13:23] <duch_kazatel> maybe use a fiddle?
[09:13:29] <Stephen> So I'm litterally hoping someone knows of a cdn that is hosting a single json file
[09:13:57] <duch_kazatel> depending on the test, you can do it with jsfiddle...
[09:14:18] <BillCriswell> Stephen: If you're using Chrome you can set --allow-file-access-from-files but you shouldn't keep that turned on.
[09:15:27] <duch_kazatel> that's an interesting idea though - a simple filehost that lets you pop up JSON/XML files for testing.
[09:15:28] <BillCriswell> Stephen: http://echo.jsontest.com/key/value/one/two
[09:15:55] <duch_kazatel> aaaand that's neat.
[09:16:14] <BillCriswell> Yeah. Still think I'd like some good dummy data.
[09:17:10] <BillCriswell> Stephen: https://api.github.com/users/username/repos
[09:22:35] <lensiwpe> hey ugys
[09:22:37] <lensiwpe> guys*
[09:22:50] <lensiwpe> I have a problem with jQuery UI with it not styling buttons
[09:23:13] <lensiwpe> even if I open chrome console and call $('button').button(); the code runs with no errors and returns a huge load of elements into the console
[09:23:17] <lensiwpe> but the buttons remain unstyled
[09:23:35] <duch_kazatel> lensiwpe do you have a fiddle or something?
[09:23:51] <lensiwpe> duch_kazatel, well that's the thing...
[09:24:00] <xqo> how can i turn these 2 lines into 1? http://jsfiddle.net/44Xhv/
[09:24:05] <lensiwpe> I would put an example together except that the code works outside the applciation and I can't grant access to the application because it's business software
[09:24:11] <lensiwpe> duch_kazatel, ^
[09:24:28] <lensiwpe> but i wondered if you could point me in the way of things to try
[09:24:35] <duch_kazatel> lensiwpe then how in the world would we be able to help you?
[09:24:51] <duch_kazatel> if it works outside of the app though, that means you've got a conflict somewhere.
[09:25:00] <duch_kazatel> maybe.
[09:25:01] <lensiwpe> duch_kazatel, you think it could be a jquery conflict?
[09:25:24] <duch_kazatel> do you have multiple versions of jquery on the page?
[09:25:27] <duch_kazatel> or of jquery UI?
[09:26:08] <lensiwpe> duch_kazatel, well that's what I was wondering
[09:26:10] <lensiwpe> the thing is though
[09:26:14] <lensiwpe> $.dialog works perfectly
[09:26:23] <duch_kazatel> some things will work, others won't.
[09:26:24] <decx> ui css included?
[09:26:33] <lensiwpe> decx, yepp - it's even styling $.dialog
[09:26:50] <lensiwpe> duch_kazatel, I see. Is there a quick and easy way to check if jquery/jquery ui is loaded twice?
[09:27:52] <lensiwpe> Yeah i only have one version of each
[09:27:53] <duch_kazatel> go through the code you've written?
[09:27:55] <duch_kazatel> okay.
[09:28:00] <lensiwpe> I did a ctrl+f
[09:28:19] <duch_kazatel> and you're sure it's not getting included by something else?
[09:28:58] <duch_kazatel> xqo - var this.windows = {_wind._id:this.statusWindow}; - is that what you mean?
[09:29:17] <rsz> is it possible to wrap a complete page refresh into an inpage async call via jquery?
[09:29:18] <xqo> duch_kazatel i dont think there can be . inside the object
[09:30:54] <btyne> I've had issues with jQuery UI and Bootstrap. Depending on the order of adding them to the page caused issues in each other.
[09:31:14] <btyne> maybe play around with the order that you are adding them to the page
[09:32:03] <lensiwpe> btyne, interesting,.
[09:32:12] <lensiwpe> btyne, js or css? or both?
[09:32:18] <btyne> js
[09:32:34] <duch_kazatel> xqo you're right - maybe you could clue me into your data structure a bit - what are you looking to accomplish?
[09:34:47] <lensiwpe> btyne, thanks, I'll do that
[09:35:11] <xqo> thats fine, thankyou.
[09:48:55] <scrupul0us> are there are async options for $.each or an alternative? ive got some 80 elements on a page that $.each processes and loads stats for via $.ajax... it takes time and is visually unappealing to have the page "refesh" this data in a sequential manner...
[09:49:27] <duch_kazatel> scrupul0us huh? does $.ajax() run once?
[09:49:49] <duch_kazatel> scrupul0us or do you just want to have everything update "all at once"?
[09:49:57] <scrupul0us> all at once preferably
[09:50:07] <scrupul0us> $.each runs on an interval
[09:50:43] <duch_kazatel> huh? $.each() "runs on an interval"?  I'd suggest creating a fragment, doing your work there, then popping the contents into the visible page.
[09:51:17] <scrupul0us> i have a function, updateStats() which is set on a timer to refresh that stats every 10 seconds... inside that function is my ajax call
[09:51:36] <duch_kazatel> even better, I'd replace .each() with a regular for loop
[09:52:22] <scrupul0us> what is the gain there out of curiosity; im not apposed to it
[09:52:34] <duch_kazatel> .each() is SLOW
[09:53:37] <scrupul0us> speed improvement would be nice
[09:53:59] <duch_kazatel> http://jsperf.com/for-vs-each-vs-each/2 - for reference
[09:54:23] <scrupul0us> i'm trying to see how I can adapt $each to a standard for... the elements im "eaching" over aren't something I can adderss in the dom with a counter
[09:54:52] <duch_kazatel> what selector are you using?
[09:55:02] <duch_kazatel> (some sample code in a fiddle would be amazing right now :) )
[09:55:48] <scrupul0us> $(".metric").each(function() {...} );
[09:56:20] <duch_kazatel> $('.metric') can be iterated over :).  try $('.metric')[0] - that should get you the first item in that array.
[09:56:45] <scrupul0us> nice, so from [0] to .length
[09:57:50] <scrupul0us> if it runs that much faster than having it "async" wont be so crucial as the data should appear faster
[09:57:52] <duch_kazatel> be even smarter and cache your array length
[09:58:15] <duch_kazatel> for (var i = 0, length = $('.metric').length; i < length; i++){}
[09:58:18] <scrupul0us> thats good advise as it doesnt change often
[09:58:33] <duch_kazatel> it shouldn't change during the for loop.
[09:59:14] <duch_kazatel> that should be a good start.  another really good idea is to also cache your selector before the for loop, as well, and then reference that.
[09:59:24] <duch_kazatel> combine those with document fragments and you should be golden.
[10:00:04] <scrupul0us> hrm... "cannot read prop length of undefined"
[10:00:18] <duch_kazatel> make sure your selector is actually matching something.
[10:00:26] <scrupul0us> yes its a valid class
[10:00:43] <duch_kazatel> console.log($('.metric')); right before the array runs.
[10:00:55] <duch_kazatel> err, the for loop i mean.
[10:01:34] <scrupul0us> its legit, i see all the values in my console
[10:02:06] <duch_kazatel> console.log($('.metric').length); - ?
[10:02:26] <scrupul0us> i get 59
[10:02:35] <scrupul0us> which is the number there are on the page
[10:02:46] <duch_kazatel> wat.
[10:04:31] <scrupul0us> hrm... ok the length error appears to be related to an inner call... i might have to rework the code a bit to handle the different iteration method
[10:05:04] <duch_kazatel> interesting.
[10:05:20] <scrupul0us> i was using "this" to get the ID of the elements within
[10:05:27] <duch_kazatel> aaaah
[10:05:36] <scrupul0us> yup, ill just have to update to use the array member
[10:06:07] <duch_kazatel> aaah, yup.
[10:10:13] <decx> duch_kazatel what's the reason i have to wrap my each replacer array in $() inside the loop?
[10:10:21] <scrupul0us> can i still pull attributes? $(".metric")[i].attr() doesnt seem to work anymore
[10:10:34] <scrupul0us> "has no method"
[10:10:50] <decx> http://jsfiddle.net/3JvKj/
[10:11:11] <duch_kazatel> oh, yeah, so now you want to cache your selector, because you're no longer referring to the jqueryfied object - $($(".metric")[i]).attr();
[10:12:43] <scrupul0us> can i cache it to a local variable to cut back on the code fluff everywhere i use it?
[10:12:45] <bberry> Hey guys. i have something that looks like this...http://jsfiddle.net/DV5an/3/  Is it okay to be using e.target.parentNode to remove the div or is there another way?
[10:13:31] <duch_kazatel> scrupul0us you should anyway :)
[10:13:44] <duch_kazatel> that'll improve performance.
[10:14:19] <scrupul0us> so var metric = $($('.metric')[0]);
[10:14:27] <scrupul0us> err [i]
[10:14:42] <duch_kazatel> bingo.
[10:14:47] <scrupul0us> ty sir
[10:15:22] <duch_kazatel> even better, before the "for" loop, cache $('.metric'), then inside the for loop, cache the current indexed version.
[10:17:52] <decx> bberry your example behaves differently when i click on the x vs clicking on the container
[10:18:43] <zumba_addict> hey guys, why can I call toLowerCase() on this variable? enteredName = $(':input[name=profile-name]').val()      I'm calling it like this, enteredName.toLowerCase()
[10:18:48] <zumba_addict> why can't I call
[10:19:11] <duch_kazatel> zumba_addict what value is the var?
[10:19:29] <zumba_addict> a string like some-this-string
[10:19:46] <duch_kazatel> what error are you getting when you call it?
[10:20:17] <zumba_addict> Cannot called method toLowerCase of undefined
[10:20:29] <zumba_addict> so looks like my var is null
[10:20:31] <duch_kazatel> try console.log($(':input[name=profile-name]').val() );
[10:20:44] <zumba_addict> that works
[10:20:47] <zumba_addict> it has a value
[10:21:01] <bberry> decx: haha! good call! i forgot about that xD
[10:21:10] <duch_kazatel> zumba_addict and that value is a string?
[10:21:22] <zumba_addict> yes, I;ll use typeOf
[10:21:25] <zumba_addict> one sec
[10:21:27] <bberry> decx: basically it is deleting the entire container if you click on the elements in the list
[10:21:31] <bberry> and not the x
[10:22:52] <decx> you can just target the x instead of everything in containerdiv
[10:23:00] <zumba_addict> I console.log(enteredName) and it showed the string i entered
[10:23:11] <zumba_addict> now I'm going to add enteredName.toLowerCase()
[10:23:11] <decx> $("#containerdiv").on("click", '.wt, function(e){
[10:23:15] <decx> wtf*
[10:23:17] <zumba_addict> that's correct right?
[10:23:29] <zumba_addict> duch_kazatel: enteredName.toLowerCase()
[10:23:34] <zumba_addict> that's correct right?
[10:24:15] <duch_kazatel> zumba_addict on strings, yes.
[10:24:20] <duch_kazatel> did you typeof on that value?
[10:24:33] <zumba_addict> yup
[10:24:39] <bberry> decx: oh really? Nice, didnt know that you could specify that in the .on function! thanks decx
[10:24:50] <zumba_addict> enteredName,  string
[10:24:54] <zumba_addict> so it's a string
[10:25:11] <duch_kazatel> zumba_addict then .toLowerCase() should work fine.
[10:25:22] <zumba_addict> i'll try it again
[10:26:16] <scrupul0us> so for wahtever reason, its stuck trying to use the last .metric in the array as the reference to update all the elements... weeeee
[10:26:35] <duch_kazatel> scrupul0us have a fiddle?
[10:26:53] <zumba_addict> it worked duch_kazatel. Not sure why it's not working on the other line, weird
[10:26:57] <scrupul0us> i might have to throw one together
[10:27:35] <rsz> http://jsfiddle.net/aC5nw/2/ Is it possible when "Load" is pressed, I can somehow bind #refresh_id so that it only puts it contents in PLACEHOLDER?
[10:28:23] <duch_kazatel> rsz huh?
[10:28:44] <duch_kazatel> rsz you mean when you click "refresh_id", it puts contents where "placeholder" is?
[10:29:12] <rsz> my page has rendered, post that I need to bind that id to act as an async submit instead of page reload.
[10:29:41] <duch_kazatel> yeah, you can do that.
[10:31:05] <rsz> submit should also occur...
[10:31:23] <duch_kazatel> rsz yup.  what aren't you clear about?
[10:31:26] <scrupul0us> ok its due to $.ajax
[10:32:05] <scrupul0us> outside when i debug i get my usual values
[10:32:15] <scrupul0us> inside $.ajax it uses the last values
[10:32:19] <scrupul0us> even on the first go
[10:33:11] <duch_kazatel> scrupul0us sounds like maybe your vars aren't scoped appropriately?
[10:33:16] <scrupul0us> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2687679/jquery-ajax-inside-a-loop-problem
[10:33:21] <rsz> I am unable to understand, how to put a form submission into a jquery ajax wrapper.(if that makes sense)
[10:33:30] <scrupul0us> looks like a variable by reference issue
[10:34:00] <duch_kazatel> rsz http://jsfiddle.net/aC5nw/3/ - that's where you start.
[10:35:11] <rsz> the placeholder, does not get replaced by the Load submission's content?
[10:35:47] <duch_kazatel> rsz I gave you the starting point.
[10:36:21] <scrupul0us> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17981631/jquery-ajax-inside-a-loop
[10:36:22] <duch_kazatel> rsz have you even tried?
[10:36:25] <scrupul0us> that solved that issue
[10:36:47] <duch_kazatel> scrupul0us aaaah yeah. scoping.
[10:37:32] <scrupul0us> my last issue is i cant seem to substr ... $($(".metric")[i]).substr($($(".metric")[i]).length - 1)
[10:37:47] <scrupul0us> has no method
[10:37:49] <decx> so many wrappers :o
[10:38:11] <scrupul0us> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[10:38:25] <dllama> hey guys,
[10:38:29] <rsz> ok, are you suggesting this: http://jsfiddle.net/aC5nw/4/, but this would involve manually calling the form action url...
[10:38:33] <duch_kazatel> scrupul0us sure - $($(".metric")[i]) - what are you getting a substring of?  what value?  because you're looking at an element.
[10:38:59] <duch_kazatel> rsz you can read the "action" attr of the form...
[10:39:37] <rsz> that's a bit invasive, can I not convert it into a something like a java Future object?
[10:39:51] <duch_kazatel> "java future object"?
[10:39:51] <scrupul0us> deeerp
[10:40:25] <dllama> I'm jusing jquery-uploader (blueimp) and have a quick question about it, pretty sure its just purely js.  as part of the multiform, it creates an array of files that are stored as originalFiles,   i need to remove each file from that array on success.  because what happens is, I'll upload 3 files, close the form, upload 3 more and on the 2nd run, it'll actually  upload 6.
[10:40:38] <dllama> so i'm hoping someone can point me in the direction of whre i need to be...
[10:40:48] <scrupul0us> well now shes working...
[10:40:52] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/aC5nw/5/ - rsz how is this "invasive"?
[10:41:06] <scrupul0us> thanks duch
[10:41:26] <duch_kazatel> scrupul0us of course!  did that all help?
[10:42:02] <dllama> https://gist.github.com/mvoloz/b933c2766e74707b9cde — thats the uploader..
[10:42:20] <decx> btw you can use a base64 image in a fiddle to simulate loading time
[10:43:08] <scrupul0us> duch: its hard to say, i will have to convert over a few more functions using each which im sure will quicken everything up
[10:43:16] <duch_kazatel> scrupul0us mmk.
[10:43:23] <scrupul0us> but on the surface it appears better
[10:43:34] <xqo> hi, im getting this error: Uncaught TypeError: Cannot call method 'echo' of undefined. why? http://jsfiddle.net/cL56M/1/
[10:43:44] <duch_kazatel> it's a pain in the ass, but you'll get much better performance out of it.
[10:43:49] <scrupul0us> the refreshes seem smoother... the onload is about the same but im not overly concerned there... theres alot of data being displayed
[10:44:05] <scrupul0us> =)
[10:44:17] <duch_kazatel> awesome
[10:44:25] <decx> i rewrote an each that adds slides to my flexslider and didnt gain anything :<
[10:44:53] <decx> but it's good anywhere else i did it
[10:45:00] <scrupul0us> time to overhaul =)
[10:45:37] <duch_kazatel> :)
[10:45:51] <rsz> I was looking for a syntax like: $('form').asyncSubmit(function() { //do post processing });
[10:46:24] <duch_kazatel> rsz you should use $.ajax() - it's complete() callback sounds like what you want.
[10:47:45] <rsz> alongwith the preventDefault mechanism, for sorm submissions?
[10:47:52] <duch_kazatel> yes.
[10:47:54] <rsz> sorm == form
[10:47:57] <duch_kazatel> you can do that.
[10:48:10] <rsz> ok, thanks alot duch_kazatel :-)
[10:48:17] <duch_kazatel> rsz of course.
[10:48:47] <dllama> guys, has anyone experienced what i described with uploaders?
[10:49:14] <duch_kazatel> dllama does that plugin have a "complete" callback or something similar?
[10:50:05] <dllama> it has done
[10:50:09] <dllama> which is where i'm logging eveyrhitng
[10:50:17] <duch_kazatel> clear the array in that "done" callback.
[10:50:21] <dllama> and where i'm trying to splice data.originalFiles
[10:50:37] <dllama> data.originalFiles.splice(0,1)
[10:50:52] <dllama> but it doesn't seem to take effect.
[10:51:31] <dllama> this is part of me loggin data.originalFiles in the success:
[10:51:33] <dllama> on first fire:
[10:51:36] <dllama> [File]
[10:51:36] <dllama> 	.	length: 0
[10:51:36] <dllama> 	.	__proto__: Array[0]
[10:51:44] <duch_kazatel> dllama woah woah woah - have a fiddle?
[10:51:57] <dllama> can i put an uploader on filddle?
[10:52:09] <dllama> btw, thats just console log, not actual content. i can put that on gist i suppose
[10:52:10] <duch_kazatel> your code would be helpful.
[10:52:27] <dllama> https://gist.github.com/mvoloz/b933c2766e74707b9cde
[10:52:45] <dllama> i'm adding console log reponses to that right now
[10:54:03] <dllama> https://gist.github.com/mvoloz/b933c2766e74707b9cde
[10:54:06] <dllama> updated with log output
[10:54:39] <duch_kazatel> I'll try to poke at this later - gotta dash to a meeting.  good luck.
[10:55:40] <dllama> thanks duch_kazatel
[10:56:58] <Kal_crunchbang> hello there guys my jquery .load(); is not working
[10:57:13] <Kal_crunchbang> shown at: acecrafting.com/out_up/
[10:58:09] <Kal_crunchbang> hello there guys my jquery .load(); is not working
[10:58:11] <Kal_crunchbang> shown at: acecrafting.com/out_up/
[10:59:14] <cohitre> Kal_crunchbang: "XMLHttpRequest cannot load https://socialdsicom.ipage.com/out_up/pages/home.html. No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource. Origin 'http://acecrafting.com' is therefore not allowed access. "
[10:59:30] <cohitre> the ajax call needs to be inside the same domain.
[10:59:45] <Kal_crunchbang> what noww???
[11:00:10] <cohitre> the URL in the `load` call needs to be in the acecrafting.com domain.
[11:00:32] <Kal_crunchbang> http://socialdsicom.ipage.com/out_up/
[11:00:56] <Kal_crunchbang> same thing
[11:01:51] <Kal_crunchbang> why is that not working??
[11:02:40] <intermission1> var foo = $('#foo'); /* what is the difference between: */ foo.html('blah'); /* and */ $(foo).html('blah');
[11:02:53] <cohitre> Kal_crunchbang: your url is https
[11:03:02] <cohitre> you need to be consistent with the domain that you are using
[11:03:23] <cohitre> you can try removing the domain part from the url string
[11:03:43] <cohitre> $('#main').load('/out_up/pages/home.html');
[11:03:47] <Kal_crunchbang> ok
[11:04:25] <Kal_crunchbang> $('#main').load('/pages/home.html');
[11:04:38] <Kal_crunchbang> same thing
[11:05:17] <Uhkis> Kal_crunchbang: works fine here
[11:05:25] <Uhkis> on this url http://socialdsicom.ipage.com/out_up/
[11:05:41] <Kal_crunchbang> nevermind moved to acecrafting.com version and its fine
[11:05:44] <Kal_crunchbang> tthank you
[11:09:28] <Kal_crunchbang> how do i fade out then fade in with new page??
[11:14:44] <Kal_crunchbang> how do i fade out then fade in with new page??
[11:20:29] <Kal_crunchbang> how do i fade out then fade in with new page??
[11:21:25] <shoky> .fadeOut().load(url, function() { $(this).fadeIn() })
[11:21:28] <shoky> and shut up
[11:21:40] <jedimind> lol
[11:21:44] <Kal_crunchbang> ok
[11:21:49] <jedimind> he just got banned in #css for being annoying
[11:21:54] <shoky> lol
[11:22:27] <Kal_crunchbang> jedi i was asking a question and you banned me for using irc for its purpose
[11:22:49] <shoky> irc's purpose is not to be annoying
[11:23:06] <NoiseEee> Kal_crunchbang: don't repeat questions, learn some etiquette
[11:23:27] <Kal_crunchbang> well no one was helping
[11:24:04] <NoiseEee> well maybe people are busy or working, guess what, we're all not here just for you
[11:24:39] <emka> how can I remove the first element in this one and only have element 2 and 3?
[11:24:40] <emka> http://jsfiddle.net/KLg73/
[11:25:59] <decx> boxes is just a string so you can't target the first child with first()
[11:26:33] <decx> or am i missing something here
[11:26:40] <shoky> it's not a string
[11:26:46] <jedimind> Kal_crunchbang you spammed the same question 4 times in the span of 3 minutes, didnt explain anything, gave no context, didnt follow any channel ruls (defined in the topic) in respect to showing us any code or your problem in a testcase
[11:26:48] <jedimind> so... you got banned
[11:27:00] <decx> so i can put markup in a wrapper and it juts works?
[11:27:08] <decx> jquery truly is magic :o
[11:27:14] <shoky> yop
[11:27:15] <jedimind> how are we supposed to help you with your code without providing us your code? you instead took a screenshot of a 200x200px part of your page and aksed "how do i fix this"
[11:27:16] <shoky> `api jQuery
[11:27:16] <b-ot> shoky: jQuery(): Accepts a string containing a CSS selector which is then used to match a set of elements. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery/
[11:27:43] <Kal_crunchbang> the script flashes the page then fades in as seen: http://acecrafting.com/out_up/
[11:29:02] <shoky> emka: here's one way  http://jsfiddle.net/KLg73/1/
[11:32:11] <Kal_crunchbang> i have http://pastebin.com/JytNFLa2 and it does not work
[11:32:39] <jedimind> Kal_crunchbang set up a testcase.
[11:32:47] <Kal_crunchbang> ???
[11:32:47] <shoky> Kal_crunchbang you didn't do what i said
[11:32:59] <Kal_crunchbang> yes because it flashed
[11:33:14] <shoky> well your paste is all wrong
[11:33:18] <Kal_crunchbang> sorry jedi but i am new to jquery so how do i do that
[11:33:21] <Kal_crunchbang> ok
[11:34:21] <shoky> also, slow and fast need to be in quotes
[11:34:31] <Kal_crunchbang> ok
[11:34:38] <decx> also you're hiding your main when the load is done
[11:35:14] <jedimind> `testcase
[11:35:14] <b-ot> jedimind: see: minimal
[11:35:17] <jedimind> `minimal
[11:35:19] <b-ot> jedimind: A minimal test case should contain precisely the HTML and JavaScript necessary to demonstrate the problem, no more and no less.  If it is more than 32 lines, it is probably not a minimal test case.
[11:35:23] <jedimind> `paste
[11:35:24] <b-ot> jedimind: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[11:35:30] <jedimind> thats for you Kal_crunchbang
[11:35:38] <Kal_crunchbang> ok
[11:35:46] <shoky> Kal_crunchbang:  $('#main').fadeOut('slow').load(url, function() { $(this).fadeIn('slow') });
[11:36:05] <Kal_crunchbang> great thank you shoky
[11:36:49] <Kal_crunchbang> flashes the page
[11:37:01] * jedimind grabs the popcorn
[11:37:07] <shoky> Kal_crunchbang ah
[11:37:18] <Kal_crunchbang> example at http://acecrafting.com/out_up/
[11:37:30] <shoky> Kal_crunchbang:  $('#main').fadeOut('slow', function() { $(this).load(url, function() { $(this).fadeIn('slow') }) })
[11:38:57] <Kal_crunchbang> that works great
[11:39:05] <Kal_crunchbang> thank you shoky
[11:39:43] <Kal_crunchbang> jedi can you unban me from #css
[11:39:49] <Kal_crunchbang> jedi can you unban me from #css please
[11:39:51] <shoky> ;D
[11:50:25] <duch_kazatel> i hate lunchtime lately.  can never figure out what to do.
[11:50:40] <decx> most people eat
[11:50:45] <duch_kazatel> derp
[11:51:06] <WebDragon> tomato basil soup with fresh mozzarella, oregano, little garlic, black pepper, dash of cayenne, and fresh basil
[11:51:22] <Kal_crunchbang> decx - and drink
[11:51:33] <duch_kazatel> oooh maybe i should go grab a beer.
[11:51:35] <WebDragon> then add sourdough artisan bread grilled cheese sandwiches with a little mustard/mayo and turkey slices, with your choice of cheese
[11:51:44] <WebDragon> and dip those in the soup
[11:51:44] <Uhkis> jLunch
[11:51:59] <WebDragon> Uhkis: don't you mean iLunch ?
[11:52:01] <duch_kazatel> i never was big into tomato soups.
[11:52:14] <Uhkis> WebDragon: youLunch, it's pretty late here :P
[11:52:31] <duch_kazatel> but i really should start making better use of our kitchens here
[11:52:37] <WebDragon> ah only 3pm here. I assumed he was on the west coast
[11:52:47] <duch_kazatel> I am on the west coast.
[11:53:19] <WebDragon> duch_kazatel: well, all I gotta say is, it's worth a try, after having just had my gf suggest the idea and then we ran out before the snow started really falling here, so we'd have everything
[11:53:36] <duch_kazatel> aaah you're in one of THOSE places.  bummer
[11:53:37] <WebDragon> I had to seriously restrain myself from licking the pot it was so damn tasty after we finished with everything
[11:54:06] <WebDragon> meh, I'm half norwegian by ancestry, so while I may dislike BEING cold, I don't mind the snow and seasonal changes so much
[11:54:07] <duch_kazatel> it's 60 degrees and slightly cloudy right now.  it'll probably peak at 70.
[11:54:23] <WebDragon> hell, I even still would be out biking in this sort of cold if it were not for the snow at the moment
[11:54:40] <decx> well dipping grilled chees in tomato soup DOES look good right now
[11:54:42] <decx> http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2871/9240899210_2bd0692463_b.jpg
[11:54:46] <WebDragon> nice .. I really like it somewhere between 75 and 95 with low humidity
[11:54:54] <jedimind> decx uhm
[11:54:55] <duch_kazatel> i prefer cold, but it's not cold enough for soup imo.  then again soup isn't really a meal to me.
[11:54:56] <jedimind> where is that
[11:54:58] <jedimind> tell me immediately
[11:55:02] <Uhkis> finland -21C says hello :)
[11:55:03] <decx> no idea
[11:55:10] <jedimind> damnit! i got jeeves to fuel the jet
[11:55:11] <decx> http://www.reddit.com/r/grilledcheese/top/
[11:55:12] <decx> ^^
[11:55:13] <duch_kazatel> and WebDragon you just described my town in spring/early summer.
[11:55:13] <WebDragon> duch_kazatel: that's what the grilled cheese sandwiches are for.
[11:55:40] <WebDragon> duch_kazatel: yeah it gets around that here in spring and summer too, but a bit more humid than I prefer
[11:56:02] <WebDragon> grilled cheese and turkey on sourdough.. you dip those in the soup :)
[11:57:09] <duch_kazatel> i'd rather just do a bunch of grilled cheese sandwiches at that point.
[11:58:29] <jedimind> decx i hate you for posting that photo
[11:59:12] <decx> the craving deepens
[11:59:33] <WebDragon> duch_kazatel: yeah but the soup thing makes it sooo much better :D
[11:59:40] <decx> apparanently it's in Bartini Morgantown, WV
[11:59:44] <WebDragon> (especially when gf helps make it special)
[12:00:04] <decx> whatever wv means
[12:00:13] <WebDragon> west virginia?
[12:00:16] <duch_kazatel> prolly
[12:00:17] <decx> sounds right
[12:08:39] <jedimind> who's coming with ?
[12:08:52] <Tviernion> Where are we going?
[12:09:04] <duch_kazatel> to hell in a handbasket.
[12:09:40] <Kal_crunchbang> :P
[12:09:45] <Kal_crunchbang> can i come??
[12:11:09] <duch_kazatel> sure, why not.
[12:11:15] <duch_kazatel> this IS #jquery.
[12:11:24] <decx> i'm gonna be late Bartini Morgantown is about 4400 miles away
[12:14:04] <Tviernion> If this is hell, it froze over.  It was 13F this morning here with a 30mph wind form the north.  Yay 3F windchill!
[12:14:14] <duch_kazatel> grats
[12:14:22] <duch_kazatel> lol @ the whole midwest
[12:17:56] <xckpd7> got a question. let's say I have a column with 5 items, and another column with 5 items
[12:18:07] <xckpd7> I want to combine the contents of the two, but I want to alternate
[12:18:28] <xckpd7> so 1st item of column 1, 1st item of column 2, 2nd item of column 1, 2nd item of column 2. any way to do this?
[12:19:11] <duch_kazatel> xckpd7 sure - can you modify the HTML of the two columns at all? if so, reference each by ID and iterate through each.
[12:19:13] <duch_kazatel> if that makes sense.
[12:19:48] <duch_kazatel> xckpd7 mind putting some example HTML in a fiddle and I can show you?
[12:19:54] <codepython777> if one uses jquery.toggle - does it internally use display:none ?
[12:20:42] <codepython777> is there a way to chance the "display:none" type behavior for toggle and make it use something else to hide an element? (off screen positioning)
[12:21:01] <duch_kazatel> codepython777 yes, toggle() sets the display property to none.
[12:21:15] <duch_kazatel> codepython777 no - you need to use .css() for that.
[12:21:49] <codepython777> duch_kazatel: Whats a good way to find off screen coordinates to hide an element? cross-platform?
[12:22:08] <duch_kazatel> codebrainz why are you moving things off screen to hide them?
[12:22:24] <duch_kazatel> err, codepython777
[12:22:24] <duch_kazatel> derp
[12:22:33] <codepython777> duch_kazatel: I'm using disqus widget on my page
[12:22:54] <codepython777> and am told that if one uses display:none - then something goes wrong with their widgets, so i need to use another hiding method
[12:23:05] <duch_kazatel> visibility: hidden;
[12:23:16] <duch_kazatel> or create a parent div and set display: none; on that instead.
[12:23:58] <codepython777> I think they do something when the widget actually displays. So they suggested off-screen positioning to hide
[12:24:08] <cohitre> codepython777: you can use toggleClass
[12:24:15] <cohitre> and just have a "discus-hidden" class
[12:24:21] <cohitre> and set the offset with css
[12:24:44] <duch_kazatel> you could do that, too.
[12:26:32] <codepython777> one last question, what is a safe way to hide something with offset with css?
[12:31:45] <decx> codepython777 you can position: absolut; left: 100%; but your parent element should be set to overflow:hidden
[12:36:37] <codepython777> decx: thanks
[12:37:47] <ahandy> Does anyone have any knowledge of superscollorama tagged with Tween?
[12:42:11] <decx> do these scroll-animation pages actually drive conversions?
[12:42:52] <NoiseEee> they drive me craaaazy
[12:42:56] <decx> i mean, it's cool. but i dont know
[12:43:39] <decx> got some wows on a presentation when i used this and everyone else had boring powerpoint stuff
[12:44:31] <NoiseEee> my guess is it will look severely dated at some point
[12:45:02] <dekiss> $.each("#aa div").bind("mouseover", function (eve) {alert(eve.target)});
[12:45:04] <dekiss> is this ok?
[12:45:20] <dekiss> I want to assign click event listeners to all divs in #aa element
[12:45:33] <NoiseEee> dekiss: you've been here forever. you haven't figured out the correct way yet?
[12:45:58] <NoiseEee> dekiss: $('#aa').on('mouseover','div',function() { //etc})
[12:46:34] <dekiss> NoiseEee can I use "bind" instead on?
[12:46:45] <NoiseEee> why would you?
[12:47:01] <NoiseEee> dekiss: its deprecated.
[12:47:04] <decx> by the way, don't rely on mouseover, you're missing out on tablets and smartphones and everything that doesnt have hover
[12:48:12] <dekiss> decx?
[12:48:15] <dekiss> what to use?
[12:49:13] <dekiss> $.each("#aa").on( "mouseover", "img", function (eveIco) {alert(eveIco.target)});
[12:49:17] <dekiss> why this is not working?
[12:49:37] <NoiseEee> dekiss: hmm, thats not what i wrote
[12:50:01] <NoiseEee> drop the $.each nonsense and for godsakes, try to LEARN when people are giving you answers, as they have been for months.
[12:51:39] <dekiss> I wanted to use each -_-
[12:51:40] <dekiss> thanks!
[12:51:45] <decx> no need
[12:52:15] <decx> $('#aa').on('mouseover','div',function() { //etc})
[12:52:27] <decx> checks for mouseovers on any div inside #aa
[12:53:32] <decx> you can stack events as well, $('#aa').on('mouseover, touchstart','div',function() { //etc}) will watch any mouseover and touch on divs inside #aa
[12:57:02] <dekiss> how can I hcange border on all of matched elements?
[12:59:37] <NoiseEee> dekiss: what have you got so far
[13:00:40] <jedimind> lol
[13:02:41] <dekiss> hey guys
[13:02:42] <dekiss> :D
[13:02:47] <dekiss> how can I get event with jquery
[13:02:51] <dekiss> and it's target
[13:03:21] <NoiseEee> dekiss: jquery, how does it work?
[13:04:03] <dekiss> sEv.target.css("border","2px solid #1F89F3");
[13:04:15] <dekiss> I used js always
[13:04:19] <dekiss> I must use jquery now
[13:05:05] <NoiseEee> http://api.jquery.com/css/ @ dekiss
[13:05:09] <dekiss> $(sEv).target.css("border","2px solid #1F89F3");
[13:05:13] <dekiss> why this is not workign now
[13:06:14] <dekiss> okok foudn out ^^
[13:06:18] <BillCriswell> dekiss: You probably want $(sEv.target).css(..) but I'm coming in late.
[13:06:20] <dekiss> NoiseEee thanks for helping me
[13:08:16] <dekiss> $("#inputSocialIcons").attr("placeholder","Enter your "+$(sEv.target).attr("class)+" link");
[13:08:26] <dekiss> BillCriswell yeah thanks I figured that out
[13:08:28] <dekiss> what about his
[13:08:30] <dekiss> how to do it
[13:08:56] <dekiss> nice
[13:08:58] <dekiss> its working ^^
[13:08:58] <BillCriswell> That should work.
[13:09:05] <dekiss> yeah I have mistake at one "
[13:09:14] <dekiss> after ("class
[13:09:18] <dekiss> THANSK!
[13:10:39] <decx> is this lazyloader ok? http://jsfiddle.net/fU6Lu/
[13:14:50] <NiGhTTraX> I'm having the same problem described here http://forum.jquery.com/topic/to-extend-or-wrap#14737000000967254, does anyone have an answer for it?
[13:17:20] <dekiss> Guys
[13:17:28] <dekiss> how can I make hover to work on touch screens
[13:17:48] <duch_kazatel> dekiss think about that for a second.
[13:17:53] <dekiss> should I assign 2 events like this? $("#linksPublic").on( "mouseout touch", "img", function (eveIco) {eveIco.target.src=socialImages[eveIco.target.className][1]});
[13:18:03] <BillCriswell> Think about it hard.
[13:18:10] <dekiss> mouseover wont do anything on touch screens?
[13:18:15] <dekiss> :D
[13:18:16] <duch_kazatel> dekiss there we go.
[13:18:22] <dekiss> um?
[13:18:23] <dekiss> cmon
[13:18:24] <duch_kazatel> there is no such thing as hover in touch.
[13:18:29] <dekiss> need little boost on jquery
[13:18:33] <dekiss> haven't used almost at all
[13:18:40] <dekiss> I just learned it and left it 4 years ago
[13:18:42] <dekiss> never used
[13:18:53] <BillCriswell> dekiss: We don't know magic.
[13:19:14] <duch_kazatel> dekiss your question is unanswerable in its current form.
[13:19:20] <decx> you're just using us (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
[13:19:31] <duch_kazatel> huh
[13:19:32] <duch_kazatel> ?
[13:19:44] <BillCriswell> dekiss: Your code was confusing me haha.
[13:32:56] <BillCriswell> decx: That works. It's kind of weird using the variable named "e" for an element to me, I expect e to mean event.
[13:33:45] <decx> true
[13:34:30] <BillCriswell> Also, no reason to do $.justbelowfold
[13:35:27] <decx> i stole that whole setup for the :above-fold expression from another plugin ;D
[13:36:32] <decx> oh right i can just write the function in there
[13:36:33] <decx> derped
[13:36:36] <decx> ^^
[13:42:52] <BillCriswell> decx: http://jsfiddle.net/fU6Lu/4/ is what I was thinking.
[13:43:46] <decx> i added something in /3 to prevent the same objects from firing again
[13:44:31] <decx> works pretty good with changing images from data- attributes on my testserver
[13:44:53] <decx> thanks for the help ^^
[13:45:05] <BillCriswell> No problem.
[13:46:28] <BillCriswell> decx: Quick tip though, should be using .on() over .bind(), and instead of calling the code inside the scroll event and outside of it you can do like $(window).on('scroll', whatever).trigger('scroll');
[13:48:01] <decx> right, and i see you cached $(window) in the expression as well. good call
[13:48:16] <duch_kazatel> cache all day erry day
[15:03:48] <harrydog> anyone know a good ajax image uploader

[15:10:29] <thinkt4nk> @harrydog https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload
[15:27:22] <mathadder> i was wondering if someone could help me understand the following usage of the jquery selector?  http://pastie.org/private/qvll05efhfnh8hqubvhdfg
[15:27:58] <mathadder> what is the purpose of the function declaration on line 2, inside the $() block?
[15:28:50] <mathadder> in other words, why surround it with the $() block?  why create a function at all?
[15:29:17] <BillCriswell> mathadder: That's short for document ready.
[15:30:01] <mathadder> BillCriswell: ohh... thank you
[15:30:10] <duch_kazatel> mathadder there are a few reasons to do that, but BillCriswell is right - that’s one thing that does.
[15:30:31] <mathadder> duch_kazatel: what are the reasons?
[15:30:45] <AgusS_ARG> good night
[15:30:54] <duch_kazatel> that’s called an IIFE - that creates a local scope that doesn’t conflict with the global scope.
[15:31:58] <mathadder> duch_kazatel: ahh thanks for the explanation
[15:36:26] <guideX> I have a custom dropdown, and when you tab on the page on most browsers, it hits the custom dropdown, but when you use ios/safari it doesn't
[15:36:50] <guideX> anyone else experienced this?
[15:40:35] <drascus> Is anyone familiar with the jQuery Accordion widget?
[15:44:17] <duch_kazatel> i’ve used it.
[15:49:08] <BillCriswell> I wish I was more familiar with this plugin. It's being a jerk.
[15:49:18] <duch_kazatel> it’s lol
[15:50:13] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: You ever happen to work with OpenSeadragon?
[15:50:47] <duch_kazatel> nope.
[15:51:34] <BillCriswell> Damn.
[16:25:47] <jlucas> ...
[16:27:06] <jedimind> ..
[16:28:20] <BillCriswell> ellipsis
[16:37:22] <duch_kazatel> good god coldfusion is awful.
[16:54:22] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: Never touched the stuff knowingly!
[16:55:48] <duch_kazatel> good.
[16:56:05] <duch_kazatel> never do.  take the pain of old java and combine it with a programming language that looks like HTML.
[16:56:25] <BillCriswell> Haha I have seen it.
[16:56:32] <BillCriswell> Looks almost XSLTish.
[16:57:04] <BillCriswell> I used to use an ecommerce platform called prostores and it was all <ss:foreach item="product" within="$store.products.whatever">
[16:57:12] <MattyD> Is it possible to find out what website this css file belongs to? http://pastebin.com/FRvdy4pM
[16:57:41] <duch_kazatel> MattyD clarify?
[16:57:49] <decx> it's right there in the text :o
[16:57:57] <duch_kazatel> MattyD that’s HTML5 boilerplate - that’s a pretty common css lib.,
[16:59:02] <decx> ah it's got some some stuff in it
[16:59:23] <decx> MattyD http://www.sixtyfps.com.au
[17:01:23] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell that’s disgusting
[17:02:55] <BillCriswell> decx: How did you come to that site from the code?
[17:03:01] <decx> awwwards_sotd_black_left2x.png
[17:03:12] <decx> lead me to the git
[17:06:31] <decx> lol it's just some site of the day banner
[17:06:51] <decx> so that might as well be something else
[17:07:04] <BillCriswell> Yes, but it's weird that that's the only thing returning
[17:07:08] <decx> ye
[17:07:42] <decx> dont you always make award sites when you need to promote your new project?
[17:07:51] <decx> you just need to promote your awards site first
[17:07:56] <decx> the seo loop
[17:07:58] <decx> ;)
[17:11:35] <BillCriswell> SEO drove me away from my last job lol
[17:11:45] <decx> had another look at thatpaste and that's clearly not it ;)
[17:12:00] <decx> ugh seo
[17:12:11] <duch_kazatel> pfff SEO is NBD honestly.
[17:12:19] <decx> that whole business aspect of the business -.-
[17:12:21] <duch_kazatel> that should’ve been “SEO is NBD TBH”
[17:13:25] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: I can't stand the stuff my boss wanted to do in the name of "SEO"
[17:13:45] <BillCriswell> Well, not me... I told him no, but our coworkers.
[17:13:53] <duch_kazatel> hah, like what?
[17:14:16] <decx> THIS AFFIL NETWORK WILL MAKE US RICH !
[17:14:25] <duch_kazatel> oh.  lol no
[17:14:26] <BillCriswell> "We need to create a sub site for each town in the county"
[17:14:31] <duch_kazatel> :(
[17:14:37] <duch_kazatel> oh jesus.
[17:14:48] <decx> WE NEED MORE DYNAMICALLY CREATED CONTENT
[17:15:02] <decx> 5000 productpages is not enough !
[17:15:04] <BillCriswell> The breadcrumb can't just say home. It needs to say "KEYWORD STUFFED SHIT Home"
[17:15:11] <duch_kazatel> oh.
[17:15:27] <BillCriswell> It wasn't hard work, it was just annoying work.
[17:15:28] <decx> add this excerpt at the bottom of the page plz. "war of the worlds"
[17:15:45] <ankurk> Can I do the ajax call before jQuery Dialog opens/loads? I want to show data from JSON in that.
[17:15:48] <decx> oh. just 50000 words this time?
[17:16:06] <duch_kazatel> honestly decent SEO isn’t necessarily all that hard.  anybody who tries too hard is making it difficult for themselves.
[17:16:52] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: It's all about being useful. My last boss would rather spend 20 hours doing bullshit than 2 hours doing something useful.
[17:17:05] <duch_kazatel> fair enough.
[17:17:26] <decx> yeah it's easy
[17:17:29] <decx> just make good content
[17:17:33] <decx> that's it
[17:17:55] <decx> then it's nbd indeed
[17:18:08] <duch_kazatel> make decent content that’s useful.
[17:18:22] <BillCriswell> Yeah, content takes thought though. Companies don't seem to want to do that all too often.
[17:19:03] <BillCriswell> I wish I could get this plugin to pan and zoom more smoothy.
[17:19:49] <decx> which one
[17:19:56] <BillCriswell> Open Seadragon
[17:20:21] <decx> i like the jquery-zoom approach
[17:20:45] <decx> at least when you have a decently large base pic
[17:21:12] <BillCriswell> This one is a lot more advanced. It uses DZI format.
[17:21:32] <decx> yeah i just noticed on the site
[17:22:35] <BillCriswell> http://ssb.criswell.mixture.io/ it like.. swoops in instead of a straight line.
[17:23:47] <BillCriswell> The spots around the edges
[17:23:54] <seoNinjaWarrior> if I reload a portion of my page using ajax all my jquery on click functions no longer apply to that reloaded content. is there a way to tell jquery to pretty much rerun all code in $(document).ready tags ?
[17:24:16] <decx> you have to bind your events in a different way
[17:24:56] <BillCriswell> seoNinjaWarrior: Event delegation.
[17:25:09] <seoNinjaWarrior> what event would you recommend binding them to?
[17:25:13] <decx> instead of $('.myelement').on('click' fn, do $('#mycontainer').on('click', '.myelement' fn
[17:25:32] <BillCriswell> $('.ajaxContainer').on('click', '.dynamicallyLoadedElement', doSomething)
[17:25:58] <seoNinjaWarrior> ahh
[17:26:00] <seoNinjaWarrior> thanks!!!
[17:26:17] <BillCriswell> That was as long as ajaxContainer doesn't get removed and added back it'll be a o k.
[17:27:25] <BillCriswell> Ok. Laptop is going to die and I'm too lazy to get the charger. Take care!
[17:28:26] <sx_> ..llllllllazy
[17:38:30] <ankurk> Why in this code snippet, only the last item from the JSON array gets set in the text boxes? No of text boxes depends on number of managers btw. http://pastebin.com/wK3nxxzD
[17:39:29] <duch_kazatel> ankurk do you have a sample of the data?
[17:40:13] <duch_kazatel> wait, you’re comparing data.Managers.length to $('input[name="project_manager[]"').length - what are those selectors?
[17:40:58] <ankurk> It should be like, {Managers: 0 : { Manager : John K }, 1 : {Manager : Jake S}}
[17:41:11] <duch_kazatel> ankurk can you create a functional fiddle?
[17:41:23] <ankurk> To be honest, I actually don't have the sample data, as it is a work related issue
[17:42:32] <duch_kazatel> err, so you can’t even mock it up? because your comparisons seem strange to me.
[17:43:07] <ankurk> yeah, I can't mock it up since I am not in front of my work computer :(
[17:44:07] <duch_kazatel> welp.  not much i can do to help.  but your comparisons are strange.  you’re comparing one length to another for some reason.
[17:44:21] <duch_kazatel> i can’t see why you’re doing that in a for loop.
[17:44:59] <ankurk> That I can explain,
[17:45:47] <ankurk> I actually this snippet is inside a .click which triggers a ajax call and jQuery dialog open
[17:45:57] <duch_kazatel> you’re checking the number of inputs against something in the data and, if they don’t match, append an extra input?
[17:46:25] <ankurk> previously what was happen on every click, the text would get appended again
[17:46:28] <duch_kazatel> and then for every input, set the value to the current manager.
[17:46:29] <ankurk> *textboxes
[17:46:51] <ankurk> so to avoid that I am comparing the length of array to number of textboxes
[17:47:13] <ankurk> so that no more text boxes should get appended
[17:47:19] <duch_kazatel> lines 7, 8, and 9 are your issue - for each input, set it’s value to the current data.managers[i].manager
[17:47:26] <duch_kazatel> do you see your issue now?
[17:48:27] <sx_sx> i d't think u should use .each in a for loop
[17:48:46] <duch_kazatel> sx_sx you can do that depending on the use case, though it’s kind of funky.
[17:49:12] <duch_kazatel> in this particular case, you’re saying “set the value of each input[name="project_manager[]" to the current manager value”
[17:49:27] <duch_kazatel> you do that for every manager value, so the last one is the one you see.
[17:49:52] <sx_sx> oh,but in this case, all of the input value will be the last value of data.Managers
[17:49:54] <duch_kazatel> ankurk do you get it now?
[17:50:02] <duch_kazatel> exactly.
[17:50:31] <ankurk> well, basically I want to set the name of managers in separate text boxes
[17:50:41] <duch_kazatel> ankurk do you see what the issue is?
[17:50:47] <ankurk> like first manager in one text box, and second in other
[17:51:14] <ankurk> well, I understand the issue little bit
[17:51:34] <ankurk> I am avoiding the append of extra inputs on subsequent clicks
[17:51:51] <duch_kazatel> but do you see why your code doesn’t make sense?
[17:53:36] <duch_kazatel> within your loop, you’re setting all inputs to the same value.
[17:54:02] <duch_kazatel> this is your fix: http://jsfiddle.net/8g9NV/1/
[17:54:03] <ankurk> agh I thought of that, so I should set all inputs out side loop
[17:54:15] <sx_sx> sometimes, we just need a liitle twist
[17:54:17] <duch_kazatel> no, do them inside the loop - take a look at what i just pasted.
[17:54:27] <tables> how do i add a load.gif to whatever jquery command i'm doing?
[17:54:40] <duch_kazatel> tables not this again.
[17:54:48] <duch_kazatel> tables I gave you code to do this yesterday.
[17:55:14] <ankurk> ahh okay, will try that, that's what I thought, I don't .each inside a for loop
[17:55:23] <ankurk> just a simple append will do
[17:55:29] <duch_kazatel> ankurk in your given case, you don’t need it.
[17:55:29] <ankurk> inside the loop
[17:55:39] <ankurk> yep
[17:55:44] <duch_kazatel> ankurk though your code assumes that a manager doesn’t all ready exist.
[17:55:58] <ankurk> well, sometimes managers can be null
[17:56:32] <duch_kazatel> your code doesn’t really check for any of that.
[17:56:57] <sx_sx> duch_kazatel, smart twist.
[17:57:15] <ankurk> I see, I need to do that too, so I can do like this, if managers = null, just append blank input?
[17:57:21] <duch_kazatel> ankurk also, selectors like input[name="project_manager[]" are sloooowwwww
[17:57:49] <ankurk> well I would have different managers in different text boxes
[17:58:03] <ankurk> like John in other & Jake in other
[17:58:11] <ankurk> any better way you would suggest
[17:58:37] <duch_kazatel> are there other inputs on this page?
[17:59:16] <ankurk> oh yes
[17:59:24] <ankurk> there are a lot of inputs
[17:59:39] <duch_kazatel> then do this: http://jsfiddle.net/8g9NV/2/
[17:59:48] <duch_kazatel> set a class on the inputs you want and match on that instead.
[17:59:52] <sx_sx> guys, I have a question, if a radio in page is disabled, it can not be sumbitted with the form?
[17:59:55] <duch_kazatel> otherwise you’re doing a pile of extra parsing.
[18:00:18] <ankurk> and there are some like these too, like suppose, Project Engineers would also be in separate text boxes
[18:01:10] <ankurk> duch_kazatel: so I will set classnames for similar cases like that as well?
[18:01:25] <ankurk> e.g. for Project Engineers as well
[18:01:49] <duch_kazatel> ankurk sure, of those are separate.
[18:02:09] <ankurk> and yes one silly question, how would collect all these when doing Ajax POST? Use stringify?
[18:02:15] <ankurk> or make an object and then push?
[18:02:27] <ankurk> *I
[18:02:30] <duch_kazatel> collecting all the inputs?
[18:02:41] <duch_kazatel> i have no idea what your app needs.
[18:02:48] <ankurk> yep, collecting all inputs (including like those) and doing a POST
[18:02:52] <duch_kazatel> you could stringify the appropriate selectors.
[18:03:01] <ankurk> essentially it's just a form
[18:03:07] <ankurk> with lot of inputs
[18:03:21] <duch_kazatel> then yeah, however you’ve been doing it should be fine.
[18:03:25] <ankurk> and inputs like in case of manager
[18:03:37] <ankurk> okat
[18:03:39] <ankurk> *okay
[18:04:23] <duch_kazatel> you could probably modify this even further so it determines the input name via the json file you’re feeding it.
[18:05:10] <ankurk> oh, that could be tricky :P
[18:05:26] <ankurk> or is there an example lying around?
[18:06:02] <duch_kazatel> well, i have no idea how the JSON file is structured, but you did see the simple string concat I did in my latest fiddle, right?
[18:07:01] <ankurk> yep
[18:07:16] <duch_kazatel> you can do that as much as you’d like.
[18:07:32] <duch_kazatel> that name field could be populated for you, etc.
[18:08:02] <duch_kazatel> anyway, i gotta head home.  enjoy folks.
[18:08:13] <ankurk> I should sleep too :P thanks man! :)
[18:21:45] <erebel55> lo
[18:23:09] <erebel55> does toggle("fold") not work with :hidden?
[18:23:11] <erebel55> http://jsfiddle.net/erebel55/gag45/6/
[18:23:31] <erebel55> by fold I am talking about jquery ui
[18:29:44] <erebel55> any help?
[18:29:58] <tables> \$('#submit').click(function(e){
[18:29:59] <tables> var musicsearch = \$('[name=\"musicsearch\"]').val();
[18:29:59] <tables> \$.get(\"/profile_apisearch?type=music&apitype=spotify&search=\"+musicsearch, function(my_var) {
[18:29:59] <tables> \$('#summary').html(my_var);
[18:29:59] <tables> });
[18:30:10] <coldhead> a stiff drink often helps
[18:30:12] <tables> when i do the .click(), how can i make it do a load.gif before it all goes to #summary?
[18:30:40] <erebel55> coldhead: probably right
[18:32:24] <tables> er,m when i call .get
[18:32:41] <coldhead> tables: insert your gif before you make the .get() call
[18:32:52] <tables> how do i do that?
[18:32:54] <tables> i'm new to jquery
[18:34:16] <coldhead> $('#summary').html('<img src="loading.gif">')
[18:34:19] <coldhead> or something like that
[18:34:22] <tables> thanks
[18:34:29] <coldhead> immediately before the .get() line
[18:34:50] <tables> that won't work
[18:34:52] <tables> \$.get(\"/profile_apisearch?type=music&apitype=spotify&search=\"+musicsearch, function(my_var) {
[18:34:52] <tables> \$('#summary').html(my_var);
[18:34:52] <tables> });
[18:34:56] <tables> say i call that .get command
[18:35:29] <coldhead> you call that .get command
[18:35:36] <tables> when i do it, how do i get my load.gif to work, before it all goes into #summary
[18:35:54] <coldhead> the .get() will take a few seconds
[18:36:05] <coldhead> so you'll see the load.gif until the .get() completes
[18:37:19] <erebel55> I am doing toggle("fold")
[18:37:24] <erebel55> and I want to check if it is folded or not
[18:37:36] <erebel55> I tried is(":hidden") but that didn't work
[18:37:36] <tables> var musicsearch = \$('[name=\"musicsearch\"]').val();
[18:37:38] <tables> \$.get(\"/profile_apisearch?type=music&apitype=spotify&search=\"+musicsearch, function(my_var) {
[18:37:38] <tables> \$('#summary').html(\"LOADING\");
[18:37:38] <tables> \$('#summary').html(my_var);
[18:37:38] <tables> });
[18:37:38] <tables> it doesn't work
[18:37:44] <tables> coldhead, ^
[18:38:19] <tables> when the $.get command executes, it should do the load.gif or loading
[18:38:22] <tables> OR
[18:38:33] <tables> \$('#submit').click(function(e){
[18:38:33] <tables> var musicsearch = \$('[name=\"musicsearch\"]').val();
[18:38:33] <tables> \$.get(\"/profile_apisearch?type=music&apitype=spotify&search=\"+musicsearch, function(my_var) {
[18:38:33] <tables> \$('#summary').html(\"LOADING\");
[18:38:33] <tables> \$('#summary').html(my_var);
[18:38:34] <tables> });
[18:38:38] <tables> });
[18:38:41] <tables> when i do the click(), it should do that load.gif or LOADING
[18:39:06] <tables> \$('#summary').html(\"LOADING\");     <-- is wrong
[18:40:36] <erebel55> dang it tables use a pastebin
[18:43:00] <erebel55> really, no ones around to answer my simple question
[18:45:24] <coldhead> tables: BEFORE the .get()
[18:45:26] <coldhead> BEFORE
[18:45:29] <coldhead> before
[18:45:37] <tables> can you show me syntax to use before get?
[18:45:39] <coldhead> anterior
[18:46:45] <coldhead> tables: http://pastebin.com/uA2SWBP5
[18:49:23] <coldhead> erebel55: it would be easier if you could link us to an example but why don't you try using .toggleClass('someclass') and then you can test with .is('.someclass') or .hasClass('someclass')
[18:49:47] <erebel55> coldhead: I did link an example
[18:49:51] <erebel55> I will link again

[18:51:45] <coldhead> what is toggle('fold') supposed to do?
[18:51:59] <Siecje> how do I find an input with a given name
[18:52:04] <Siecje> or even id startswith
[18:52:10] <erebel55> coldhead: http://api.jqueryui.com/fold-effect/

[19:13:51] <fattest> I like this image gallery and i was wondering if how to  add my own images http://jsfiddle.net/whortonda/4YfWy/ using html
[19:24:48] <flebron> Hi. .get(k) gives me the kth element. Is there an easier way, other than $(... .get(k)) to get a jQuery wrapper around the kth element? (Like .first() does for the 0th.)
[19:24:49] <coldhead> fattest: simplest would be just to host your images on picasa and change the username and album ID to load those
[19:25:07] <fattest> coldhead: oh ok cheers
[19:25:55] <flebron> Oh, .eq.
[19:29:05] <coldhead> great work flebron
[19:29:12] <coldhead> let's all take a 5 minute break
[19:31:40] <coldhead> lol zumba_addict
[19:38:06] <prtksxna> coldhead: lol
[20:11:26] <sadtaco> So. .css('background-color') returns an rgb(foo,foo,foo) string. What's the easiest way to manipulate those numbers, say to reduce them all to half?
[20:15:16] <coldhead> sadtaco: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-color
[20:17:27] <sadtaco> Well I usually think moar plugins isn't the simplest thing in the end, but that does look nice.
[20:19:56] <coldhead> color is a pretty big deal in web stuff so it makes sense to use a lib for it
[20:20:33] <coldhead> and it's jquery official so it's theoretically well supported
[20:24:58] <sadtaco> How do I actually cut all the values in half with it though? I'm not seeing simple math functions
[20:27:14] <Fenikkusu_> Can anyone give me some verbage on how I might duplicate the add_filter function of WordPress? In other words, I wish to trigger a function and get the results from said function/s
[20:27:15] <sadtaco> lightness, saturation, hue.  Those first two don't adjust a 255 value.
[20:27:48] <duch_kazatel> Fenikkusu_you call the function and store the result in a var?
[20:27:56] <duch_kazatel> Fenikkusu_ it depends on the function in question.
[20:29:33] <Fenikkusu_> IE: var result = $(obj).trigger('my_hook'), $(obj).bind('my_hook', function(var) { return var /2}
[20:30:36] <duch_kazatel> Fenikkusu_ so you want to store var / 2 from your bind callback in result?
[20:30:59] <Fenikkusu_> duch_kazatel, That is correct.
[20:33:30] <duch_kazatel> Fenikkusu_ i think you’re mistaken about how bind works.
[20:34:00] <duch_kazatel> Fenikkusu_ what problem are you actually trying to solve?
[20:34:04] <Fenikkusu_> I'm aware of how mind works. I'm just trying to utalize the power of bind in a different manner.
[20:34:20] <duch_kazatel> how?
[20:34:49] <duch_kazatel> also, be aware that bind is no longer the preferred method of binding to events.
[20:35:55] <Fenikkusu_> When using bind, you are essentially adding your function to a stack assigned to a specific hook. If said hook is triggered, each function within the stack is called passing any given arguments.
[20:36:04] <Fenikkusu_> on/bind meh lol
[20:36:13] <duch_kazatel> that’s kind of how that works, sure.
[20:37:29] <hfp> Hey guys! So I am using .focus() on a text input. I was expecting that on an Android phone, the keyboard would popup but instead the user has to touch the focused field to have the keyboard popup. Is this an Android issue or would I be able to have the keyboard popup automatically with jQuery?
[20:39:15] <duch_kazatel> hfp - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2403632/android-show-soft-keyboard-automatically-when-focus-is-on-an-edittext
[20:39:22] <duch_kazatel> you can do it with vanilla javascript.
[20:39:24] <sadtaco> jquery.Color seems to have a compatability issue with jsPlumb
[20:41:26] <hfp> duch_kazatel: Thanks
[20:41:39] <duch_kazatel> deffo
[20:43:41] <Siecje> anyone know why bootstrap datepicker doesn't have proper styles? http://i.imgur.com/yvCEEHP.png
[20:44:12] <spygame> is there any way to create a timestamp in javascript/jquery for a given value of time, like i want to create a timestamp for "02:30PM" for today how do i do it ?
[20:44:26] <duch_kazatel> spygame the date object.
[20:45:24] <duch_kazatel> spygame http://jsfiddle.net/aUE6F/
[20:45:36] <spygame> duch_kazatel: i tried giving input to date like new Date('02:30PM') got error, what's the right way ?
[20:48:54] <spygame> duch_kazatel: that will give me the current timestamp, i'm using jquery datepicker and i have time slots and i wanna combine them and create a timestamp, is there any way to do it ?
[20:48:56] <duch_kazatel> spygame oh yeah you have to do that manually: http://jsfiddle.net/aUE6F/1/
[20:50:52] <spygame> duch_kazatel: i wanna do the reverse of this, create a timestamp from a given value of time, not the current time
[20:51:18] <duch_kazatel> huh?  you want to seed it certain data and get it formatted back differently?
[20:52:22] <duch_kazatel> you’ll probably have to do it manually.
[20:54:31] <duch_kazatel> aaah, you want to give it an hour/minute combo and have it spit back out the enitre timestamp for today with that time.
[20:56:26] <spygame> duch_kazatel: yes that's what i'm looking for
[20:56:49] <spygame> duch_kazatel: do i have to do it manually or is there something out there that i can use
[20:56:52] <duch_kazatel> you’ll have to do it manualy.
[21:04:19] <duch_kazatel> late night #jquery
[21:08:55] <coldhead> this is the best part of #jQuery
[21:09:07] <coldhead> so duch_kazatel uh what are you wearing, baby?
[21:09:28] <duch_kazatel>  http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_XCCzcMw9CYM/Sz14TAhLHBI/AAAAAAAAEPg/1A4BwHSRw9s/s1600/jzy9i0.gif
[21:10:25] <duch_kazatel> i wish we could get some weather here in CA.
[21:25:12] <hfp> duch_kazatel: This doesn't work for me. I am focussing a textinput upon page loading and I want the keyboard to be showing right away. The Stack Overflow method seems to be for java?
[21:26:25] <duch_kazatel> derp you’re right.  you might not be able to do it.
[21:29:01] <duch_kazatel> yeah - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8858094/how-to-focus-an-input-field-on-android-browser-through-javascript-or-jquery
[21:29:09] <duch_kazatel> basically, you have to bind it to some sort of click.
[21:31:28] <hfp> Yeh tried that too and it doesn't show the keyboard. Seems like it's not possible out of the box and require a hack that will break whenever the browser/Android is updated... Neermind, I'll let the user touch the focussed field to bring the keyboard up
[21:31:50] <duch_kazatel> that’ll be your best bet.
[21:33:16] <Anwar> hai gize
[21:33:20] <Anwar> any tips on why the alert is not working?
[21:33:20] <Anwar> http://jsfiddle.net/Nt73c/
[21:34:05] <duch_kazatel> $.find isn’t a thing.
[21:34:24] <duch_kazatel> .find() is a thing, but you’re not using that here.
[21:34:36] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/Nt73c/1/
[21:34:56] <Anwar> oh.
[21:35:06] <Anwar> uhh
[21:35:08] <duch_kazatel> are you new to jquery?
[21:35:10] <Anwar> thanks a lot
[21:35:17] <Anwar> uhh, a little new
[21:35:20] <Anwar> not absolutely new.
[21:35:22] <Anwar> http://jsfiddle.net/Nt73c/
[21:35:24] <Anwar> why does this work then
[21:35:58] <duch_kazatel> that doesn’t work for me.
[21:36:11] <Anwar> oh
[21:36:14] <Anwar> i mean replace .val() with .length
[21:36:18] <Anwar> and it'll alert(1)
[21:36:29] <Anwar> i forgot to save it before giving you the link ;s
[21:36:35] <duch_kazatel> it alerts 0 for me.
[21:36:39] <Anwar> oh
[21:36:52] <Anwar> well, I got it, so find() is only for children
[21:36:53] <Anwar> ?
[21:37:02] <Uhkis> hfp: focus() brings up keyboard on android firefox at least
[21:37:23] <hfp> Uhkis: Ah maybe, I was testing with Chrome
[21:37:48] <duch_kazatel> .find() is for doing deep searches of children of whatever you’re currently looking at.
[21:37:57] <Uhkis> i tried firefox, chrome and stock, only ff worked as intended
[21:37:59] <duch_kazatel> so you could do $(‘div’).find(‘butts’)
[21:38:17] <Anwar> ah ok
[21:38:32] <Anwar> I guess in my code, .find() is appropriate
[21:38:42] <Anwar> since im doing it on a string s
[21:38:43] <Anwar> $(s).find('input[name="message"]').attr('value');
[21:38:59] <duch_kazatel> I’d avoid using that name= match.
[21:39:02] <duch_kazatel> it’s slooooowwwww.
[21:39:29] <Anwar> oh...
[21:39:33] <Anwar> well, there's multiple inputs
[21:39:53] <Anwar> how slow is 'sloooowwww'? :p
[21:40:04] <duch_kazatel> can you add a class do the relevant inputs instead/
[21:40:18] <Anwar> oh, this is for a website that I'm not making
[21:40:25] <Anwar> I'm doing .get() to another website
[21:40:29] <Anwar> and trying to get certain values from it
[21:40:58] <duch_kazatel> are you using a form to fill in something for the .get()?
[21:41:12] <Anwar> no
[21:42:00] <duch_kazatel> kay
[21:42:21] <Anwar> Using jquery on the reply age
[21:42:22] <Anwar> page
[21:42:28] <Anwar> and for some reason, its not working soemtimes
[21:42:34] <Anwar> so im trying to debug on jsfiddle
[21:43:00] <duch_kazatel> aaah, the input is in the page you’re fetching?
[21:43:24] <Anwar> yes
[21:43:32] <Anwar> I think its like a redirecting page.
[21:43:43] <Anwar> because I see this:
[21:43:43] <Anwar> onLoad="messageform.submit();
[21:43:57] <Anwar> So the reply page automatically redirects.
[21:43:58] <duch_kazatel> and you’re using the success callback of that get, right?
[21:44:08] <Anwar> yes
[21:44:12] <duch_kazatel> okay cool.
[21:44:12] <Anwar> I never use teh fail callback :p
[21:44:39] <duch_kazatel> get doesn’t have one.
[21:44:47] <duch_kazatel> that’s why i prefer $.ajax();
[21:44:57] <Anwar> ah derp. im using a post
[21:45:10] <Anwar> $.post('/Attack.php',{bid:id},function(f){log(extractMsg(f));});
[21:45:24] <Anwar> and extractMsg() is what looks for the input[name='message']
[21:45:36] <duch_kazatel> ah
[21:46:01] <Anwar> most of the time, it logs the proper thing
[21:46:06] <Anwar> but sometimes, it omits it
[21:46:25] <duch_kazatel> weird
[21:47:06] <Anwar> I've found jquery to be VERY helpful in getting only specific data i want from the page
[21:47:22] <Anwar> previously, I had to use a ton of regex and stringsplit, and stuff like that
[21:47:27] <duch_kazatel> the sizzle selector engine is a beautiful thing for that.
[21:47:34] <duch_kazatel> it abstracts away a lot of the nonsense.
[21:47:48] <Anwar> I'm trying to port my code over to python's request
[21:47:59] <duch_kazatel> but you have to be careful with it because it can quickly get unwieldy.
[21:48:00] <Anwar> request library, but it lacks jquery selectors :(
[21:48:03] <duch_kazatel> and slow.
[21:49:06] <Anwar> hmm on jsfiddle, it works (it extracts the right thing)
[21:52:48] <Anwar> you think having html in the value string will mess things up?
[21:53:04] <duch_kazatel> it shouldn’t.
[21:53:08] <duch_kazatel> it’s a string.
[21:58:35] <duch_kazatel> all right dudes and/or dudettes - I’m out.  enjoy.
[22:06:02] <royalty> ok so
[22:06:08] <royalty> let's say in $.ajax
[22:06:38] <royalty> I wanted to post to /create from where I was? suppose I was in basesiteurl/users
[22:07:00] <royalty> what url do I feed the url option
[22:07:06] <royalty> to get their via a relative path
[22:09:09] <royalty> nevermind i got it
[22:09:11] <royalty> ugh
[22:09:31] <Anwar> can u do the /create from a browser?
[22:10:27] <Anwar> if so, you can open developer toolbox and see what url is sent
[22:52:57] <Jolsen> Hi maybe someone would've an advice for me? Should a property in JSON which "optional" either be nonexistent or conain a value which indicates that it's undefined. There are certainly pros and cons to both but what would you favour?
[23:06:29] <Jolsen> JavaScript Object Notation, it looks a lot like KSP files but is slightly different. ;)
[23:06:38] <Jolsen> Ups, wrong window.
[23:08:52] <Jolsen> Well i decied on what to do.Thanks for letting me meditate on it! :)
[23:18:11] <DarsVaeda> Hi, sorry a bit of a long question: I like to create a page just with html and js( jquery ) doing the work, php as a service in the background to be called via ajax. so I have an empty page and load my elements (html) into a container and with it the appropriate js files to do the magic...say I have a button that inits a counter, that would replace that button with the counter load a js that counts up, there would also be a new button to stop
[23:18:11] <DarsVaeda>  the counter and place that with the original starting button, my question now is if that is a good habit to do so and is there a way to unload, loaded scripts so they don't float around useless
[23:23:26] <vinex08> hmmm.. http://jsfiddle.net/uFB6Y/  why i cant get the .desc to show?
[23:24:20] <morfin> hello
[23:24:35] <morfin> does $.extend extend object recursively?
[23:27:12] <kevireilly> vinex08: find uses a selector like any other, so you probably intend .find('.desc')
[23:27:12] <morfin> i want to merge 2 objects with options and both of them have subobject containing some options for underlying datepicker so i need to merge them
[23:28:10] <kevireilly> vinex08: also noteworthy, not a deal breaker, but you might want to cache $(this) -- IE: var that = $(this); that.animate that.find that.etc
[23:29:44] <morfin> hmm
[23:30:15] <morfin> seems like that's recursive merging
[23:30:18] <naeluh> I am using   $('#newload').remove(); which includes a <script src="js/vid.js"></script> and even on remove it keeps running is there a reason why?
[23:30:31] <vinex08> thanks man! didnt see that .
[23:30:36] <naeluh> even though its gone?
[23:30:41] <vinex08> the missing dot
[23:30:41] <naeluh> from the div
[23:30:57] <kevireilly> vinex08: no worries, we'll all make the same mistake again, i'm sure :)
[23:30:57] <morfin> i think that's because you can't just load\unload script using jquery
[23:31:18] <naeluh> morfin: ok so how is that handled?
[23:31:48] <morfin> i am loading scripts using native JS appending script to head i think i need to remove that object like that as well
[23:32:14] <naeluh> does that work?
[23:32:20] <vinex08> actually that's my first jQuery script. after watching the try.jquery tuts.. i saw some randome theme and tried to imitate the effect. http://metcreative.com/demo/wp_condoma/  :)
[23:33:22] <kevireilly> morfin: you might be interested in $.getScript
[23:33:36] <morfin> hm?
[23:34:04] <morfin> lol that's almost same thing as i used
[23:35:12] <morfin> i hope second argument is callback whenscript was loaded
[23:35:34] <kevireilly> yah http://api.jquery.com/jquery.getscript/
[23:35:52] <morfin> anyway i am not sure anout unloading scripts
[23:36:15] <kevireilly> same here actually, i was looking at a similar goal of mine and seems im not removing it from the dom
[23:37:07] <morfin> btw i am not interested in that right now
[23:37:58] <morfin> writing some plugins to simplify work with links(linkselect,linkdatepicker,linkmultiselect)
[23:37:59] <vinex08> kevireilly: in my jsfiddle, should i just use .hover instead of mouseenter and leave ?
[23:38:17] <morfin> hover have both handlers
[23:38:31] <vinex08> so it's wiser to use that?
[23:39:27] <kevireilly> vinex08: that is one option indeed. One other thing worth noting is that you can chain most of those $(this) references depending on your use case. You might also be interested to know that most of those have callbacks, in case you want something to occur only after the animation occurs, for instance
[23:40:55] <kevireilly> *only after the animation completes
[23:41:50] <morfin> i know  you can pass callback to .animate so do something when it's ended
[23:42:13] <vinex08> a callback, ok. also i have noticed that when i hover my mouse a few times.. the effect keeps stacking
[23:42:16] <morfin> also i used some function to do something while it's running
[23:43:06] <kevireilly> i guess animate and show were the only ones applicable ;) thought might also but me wrong
[23:43:19] <kevireilly> *thought find might also
[23:43:19] <morfin> like call jqGrid("resizeGrid") when other element is expanding to collapse it
[23:44:34] <kevireilly> vinex08: can you send an updated link?
[23:45:01] <vinex08> just a min. i'm trying to experiment things :)
[23:50:14] <vinex08> http://jsfiddle.net/uFB6Y/1/  hmmm... trying to use the callback thingy,
[23:52:03] <xqo> hi, how can I access "this" of an object outside of the object? http://jsfiddle.net/3ZfG6/
[23:57:21] <Cork> xqo: you would have to store this as a different varaible
[23:57:25] <Cork> *variable
[23:57:41] <Cork> this is always set when you call a function
[23:57:44] <xqo> Cork there will be many Test instances made, how do i do it safely?
[23:57:56] <xqo> so one onopen doesnt use the wrong Test instance
[23:57:57] <Cork> the question is a bit generic
[23:58:07] <Cork> what is it you are trying to do
[23:58:47] <xqo> im making an irc client
[23:58:49] <xqo> like qwebirc
[23:58:54] <Cork> xqo: if you want ws to hold a reference to Test, you need to have a reference to it
[23:59:09] <Cork> xqo: the functions in prototype doesn't know about what object they belong to
[23:59:29] <Cork> so on line 4 you effectively transfer the onopen function to the ws object
[23:59:52] <Cork> xqo: if you don't need older ie you can use .bind to force the this object
