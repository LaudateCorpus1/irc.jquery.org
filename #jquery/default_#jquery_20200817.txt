[13:05:26] <TMC> Hi
[13:06:08] <robertmaxrees> mornin'
[13:07:44] <TMC> robertmaxrees i need resolve problem
[13:07:59] <robertmaxrees> 'k
[13:09:04] <TMC> i need painted scored based circles
[13:09:23] <TMC> 10 , painted 5 circles green
[13:09:39] <TMC> 5 , painted 5 circles , 2 color yellow
[13:09:42] <robertmaxrees> TMC it'll be much faster if you can show a jsfiddle with your problem.
[13:10:11] <TMC> ok
[13:13:13] <TMC> https://jsfiddle.net/#&togetherjs=Qle9Iy8fUS
[13:13:44] <robertmaxrees> can you just save it and share the link instead?
[13:13:51] <robertmaxrees> togetherjs bugs out constantly.
[13:15:02] <robertmaxrees> TMC
[13:15:31] <TMC> tell me
[13:15:51] <robertmaxrees> press the "save" button and share the page after that.
[13:15:55] <robertmaxrees> instead of using "collaborate".
[13:16:23] <TMC> ok
[13:18:13] <TMC> https://jsfiddle.net/caacastellanosc/Ld1mkvo8/2/
[13:19:14] <robertmaxrees> okay.
[13:19:18] <robertmaxrees> lista is undefine?
[13:19:55] <robertmaxrees> *undefined
[13:20:30] <robertmaxrees> also added jquery to it here TMC: https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/Ljk673qs/1/
[13:22:39] <TMC> https://jsfiddle.net/caacastellanosc/co5db8zw/
[13:22:46] <TMC> add text
[13:22:56] <TMC> evaluate
[13:22:59] <TMC> ,8.7
[13:23:08] <TMC> 8.7 evaluate ranking
[13:23:09] <robertmaxrees> still getting "lista is not defined"
[13:23:22] <TMC> Read DOM
[13:23:28] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:23:33] <robertmaxrees> you mean the HTML.
[13:23:46] <robertmaxrees> ;) so what's the question then?
[13:24:12] <TMC> https://jsfiddle.net/caacastellanosc/co5db8zw/3/
[13:25:05] <robertmaxrees> hrm still getting js errors.  either way - TMC what's your question?
[13:26:04] <TMC> I want to read 8.7 and put it in the ranges that are defined and draw the circles
[13:26:31] <robertmaxrees> so you want to add that to the rankColorsAndRanges array?
[13:27:47] <robertmaxrees> TMC ^
[13:32:44] <TMC> what do you mean add it?
[13:32:53] <robertmaxrees> literally that.
[13:33:01] <robertmaxrees> did you want to place that value into the "rankColorsAndRanges" array?
[13:33:22] <robertmaxrees> or are you just asking how to parse 4 _ 8.1 into just 8.1?
[13:33:57] <robertmaxrees> TMC
[13:34:32] <TMC> If I want you to just read data 8.1, overwrite the sun with that value according to the rankings
[13:35:02] <TMC> That is, read 8.1, enter the calculation and print the circles
[13:35:16] <robertmaxrees> gotcha.  you'll need to get this to stop throwing errors first.
[13:36:08] <robertmaxrees> looks like your issue is in getRankNumber
[13:36:41] <robertmaxrees> wait why are you throwing in that function??
[13:37:09] <robertmaxrees> aaaah i see.  interesting.  had to translate.  so you're trying to fix that comparison.  gotcha.
[13:38:25] <TMC> Uncaught Se llegó al final del arreglo de rangos pero ningún color corresponde al valor: 4
[13:39:13] <robertmaxrees> so first off: your for loop is bad.
[13:39:23] <robertmaxrees> for (var i; i < rankColorsAndRanges.length; i++) { won't work because i isn't set to anything.
[13:39:42] <robertmaxrees> you want var i = 0;
[13:41:44] <robertmaxrees> TMC
[13:41:56] <TMC> add i=0
[13:42:03] <robertmaxrees> yeah, you should :)
[13:42:06] <TMC> no funtional funtion
[13:42:28] <robertmaxrees> so update the fiddle and we can keep working on it :)
[13:42:53] <robertmaxrees> also that function is trying to read rangesColors but that isn't defined anywhere.
[13:43:01] <TMC> https://jsfiddle.net/caacastellanosc/co5db8zw/6/
[13:43:26] <robertmaxrees> yeah now you want to fix that rangesColors bit :)
[13:45:17] <TMC> there must be the biggest mistake :(
[13:45:23] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[13:45:56] <robertmaxrees> looks like you just need to update some code and this might work properly.
[13:46:49] <TMC> You know which one I should correct, I've really been hours behind the error
[13:47:08] <robertmaxrees> all of it.
[13:47:12] <robertmaxrees> otherwise it won't work.
[13:51:05] <TMC> I do not understand, because the exception of getrank
[13:51:39] <robertmaxrees> right.  in that function you're referencing rangesColors, but that variable doesn't exist.
[13:52:08] <robertmaxrees> it looks like you might want rankColorsAndRanges instead.
[14:15:13] <TMC> I'm reviewing
[14:15:25] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[14:19:48] <TMC> add rankColorsAndRanges replace rangecolors
[14:20:00] <robertmaxrees> right.
[14:20:13] <robertmaxrees> so go ahead and make that fix.
[14:20:49] <TMC> https://jsfiddle.net/caacastellanosc/co5db8zw/14/
[14:21:05] <robertmaxrees> sure
[14:21:11] <robertmaxrees> looks like that fixed the errors :)
[14:21:36] <robertmaxrees> and you're wrtiting those elements out to the page.  should be good to go!
[14:24:47] <TMC> correct it already overwrites and creates the circles, but it does not take the colors :O
[14:25:04] <robertmaxrees> where are these colors coming from??
[14:26:06] <TMC> "color": "#FF0000",
[14:26:10] <robertmaxrees> okay
[14:26:15] <robertmaxrees> so try logging color in makeHtmlRankCirclesString
[14:26:32] <robertmaxrees> what do you get?
[14:26:44] <TMC> paint everything gray
[14:26:49] <robertmaxrees> ...
[14:27:03] <robertmaxrees> so in makeHtmlRankCirclesString, do console.log(color);
[14:27:09] <robertmaxrees> make sure it's what you expect it to be.
[14:28:30] <TMC> ok
[14:28:41] <robertmaxrees> so what is it?
[14:31:41] <TMC> I am sending the whole array
[14:31:49] <robertmaxrees> :)
[14:32:05] <robertmaxrees> back in drawCirclesOnDimensions, you're doing let color = rankColorsAndRanges[rankNumber - 1];
[14:32:17] <robertmaxrees> that's grabbing the entire object, not the specific color.
[14:36:34] <robertmaxrees> TMC looks like that should fix it :)
[14:47:12] * robertmaxrees plays the jeopardy "think" music
[14:52:05] <TMC> rankColorsAndRanges[i].color[rankNumber - 1];
[14:52:07] <TMC> ????
[14:53:19] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[14:53:33] <robertmaxrees> no...
[14:53:56] <robertmaxrees> let color = rankColorsAndRanges[rankNumber - 1]; gets you the object with the color in it - you want to use .color.
[14:54:03] <robertmaxrees> let color = rankColorsAndRanges[rankNumber - 1].color;
[14:55:21] <TMC> wow perfect :)
[14:55:38] <TMC> really, thank you so much
[14:55:45] <robertmaxrees> def.  also -
[14:56:06] <robertmaxrees> you declare function drawCirclesOnDimensions(rangesColors) {, but you don't actually use rangesColors.
[14:56:11] <robertmaxrees> you can make that just function drawCirclesOnDimensions() {
[14:56:19] <robertmaxrees> and then change drawCirclesOnDimensions(rankColorsAndRanges); to drawCirclesOnDimensions();
[14:57:32] <TMC> into drawCirclesOnDimensions() ??
[14:57:46] <robertmaxrees> yes.
[14:58:55] <robertmaxrees> literally just said that lol.
[15:58:23] <TMC> yes :)
[18:44:05] <TMC> bye robertmaxrees
[18:45:04] * robertmaxrees waves
[23:56:13] <baruna> hi, somebody here? https://jsfiddle.net/fgL61zkw/ < when I click the [+] button on the dark green table head, a new table is added after the existing one. But when I click the same button on the newly added table, a new table is added after the first one. I really don't understand why
[23:56:28] <baruna> why $('table').last() doesn't select the last table??
[23:58:43] <robertmaxrees> your first problem is that you're repeating IDs.
