[03:04:03] <suothItalyHelp> https://jsfiddle.net/tx814duz/1/
[03:22:31] <Cork> suothItalyHelp: if you want help ask your question not for someone
[03:22:51] <Cork> as asking for someone rarely will get you very far on irc
[03:26:01] <suothItalyHelp> sorry its my bad english
[03:26:17] <suothItalyHelp> but i really need help and im struggling for solve this about 2 days
[03:26:34] <Cork> well so ask your question
[03:27:57] <suothItalyHelp> this is my question:
[03:27:59] <suothItalyHelp> https://jsfiddle.net/tx814duz/1/
[03:28:13] <suothItalyHelp> I need to hide the element with class (elmtohide), only if one of the value inside of span with class (price) are major of 20. Im going crazy!
[03:28:54] <Cork> "major of 20"?
[03:29:15] <suothItalyHelp> greater
[03:29:17] <suothItalyHelp> sorry
[03:29:17] <Cork> you mean if the integer value is >= 20?
[03:29:30] <suothItalyHelp> yes
[03:29:38] <Cork> can you modify the html?
[03:29:50] <suothItalyHelp> no
[03:29:55] <suothItalyHelp> the class of span are same
[03:29:59] <suothItalyHelp> i cannot modify
[03:30:22] <suothItalyHelp> for this im using each. but maybe in wrong mode
[03:32:38] <Cork> so let me try to get this right, you want to hide small numbers by default and have a link to show all values?
[03:34:44] <suothItalyHelp> no, consider every span with price class are total of each shop on checkout.
[03:35:29] <suothItalyHelp> i need, if only one of this span are less to 20, to hide an element with one class and alert You need to spent more than 20
[03:38:55] <Cork> are you trying to have a "by at least" check?
[03:39:12] <Cork> cause why does it matter if you have one cost and not two that is less then a value?
[03:40:26] <suothItalyHelp> Yes, I just want to check.The important thing is that at least one of the values ​​is not less than 20
[03:41:16] <Cork> so nothing can be less then 20 in other words
[03:41:17] <suothItalyHelp> becouse if a customers arrive to checkout and not have spend 20 to one of shop, i need to block the checkout button and alert him to spent more than 20
[03:41:25] <suothItalyHelp> yes
[03:42:20] <suothItalyHelp> will be fantastic if i can show the shop name too, consider the htlm are like this for each line:
[03:43:37] <suothItalyHelp> <span class="vendceck"> shop name </span>total €<span class=“price">1.50</span><br><span class="vendceck"> shop name 2</span>total €<span class=“price">11.00</span>
[03:44:21] <Cork> will you have more then one total?
[03:44:54] <suothItalyHelp> its a multivendor, the customers can buy from more of one shop
[03:45:22] <suothItalyHelp> when go to checkout he see the single total of each shop, and total of all
[03:46:53] <Cork> so something like https://jsfiddle.net/gc27xj5f/1/ ?
[03:47:37] <Cork> oops forgot one cleanup
[03:48:18] <Cork> https://jsfiddle.net/gc27xj5f/2/
[03:52:30] <suothItalyHelp> mmm
[03:52:41] <suothItalyHelp> not work if you increase the number inside span price
[03:52:51] <suothItalyHelp> try to put a value greater than 20
[03:52:56] <suothItalyHelp> show same result
[03:53:50] <Cork> works fine here
[03:53:56] <Cork> you do have to return the code
[03:55:23] <suothItalyHelp> but if one of element are greater than 20, the textarea show same  too cheap
[03:56:22] <suothItalyHelp> sorry im wrong
[03:56:25] <Cork> ya, cause you said if any of them are less then 20
[03:56:27] <suothItalyHelp> thanks a lor
[03:58:00] <Cork> suothItalyHelp: though don't just copy paste that code
[03:58:11] <Cork> make SURE you understand what it does so you can maintain it if later
[03:58:22] <Cork> -if
[03:58:56] <suothItalyHelp> for shure man :)  i appreciate a lot your help
[03:59:09] <Cork> np
[07:18:15] <Translat-Embedde> hii how to make hide and show elements in form if i using $("#div").hide(); element is hidden this is ok and showing is $("#div").show(); this is too ok but if i using "F5" - key (refreshing) page elements who are hidden sometimes showing and i don't how eliminating this
[07:18:50] <Translat-Embedde> can somebody know what i must to do ?
[07:19:29] <Cork> Translat-Embedde: f5 reloads the page dom states won't be remembered
[07:19:32] <bestdesign> Translat-Embedde: all refresh page is set to default
[07:19:36] <bestdesign> yes
[07:20:06] <Cork> simplest solution is to store the state you want to keep around in sessionStore
[07:21:19] <bestdesign> Translat-Embedde: what data you want to remember?
[07:21:55] <Cork> the visible hidden state
[07:22:00] <Cork> its in the question :)
[07:22:32] <bestdesign> Cork: i think that useless to remember for that
[07:23:30] <Cork> bestdesign: that's a very brave statement to make without knowing what he is doing :)
[07:25:44] <Translat-Embedde> showing is making if user click on radiobutton
[07:26:18] <bestdesign> Translat-Embedde: yes but is a repeat thing no need to remember that
[07:26:21] <Translat-Embedde> one radiobutton make hide and second make show
[07:26:51] <Cork> Translat-Embedde: and why do you need this to be rememberd cross page loads?=
[07:27:26] <Cork> that is the question we're curious about
[07:28:35] <Translat-Embedde> im trying refreshing page where is contact form with script sho make showing and hiding elements and i want know if showing hidden elements in refresh or no
[07:29:10] <Cork> Translat-Embedde: you mean update it with new info from the server?
[07:30:16] <Translat-Embedde> no update with new info from server,
[07:30:18] <bestdesign> Translat-Embedde: a contact form contain repeat process so no one want to remember what they check :D if need do again
[07:30:39] <Cork> Translat-Embedde: why not just fetch that through ajax and update inpage?
[07:31:06] <Cork> then you don't have to save the dom state cross page loads
[07:31:26] <Cork> if possible it is normally the better solution
[07:31:37] <Cork> as you can't store all dom state so the page will feel klonky
[07:34:31] <undefined_bob> klonky is such a cute word :3
[07:35:56] <Translat-Embedde> i have inputs in form where i showing data with jquery if people have company they must filling company name, company identification number,comany tax identification number and people who not have company they have hidden inputs where are "company name, company identification number,comany tax identification number"
[07:37:50] <Translat-Embedde> and script is function but if i want if hidden elements showing if i refresh page, i can they showing but they are set show if radio button is checked
[07:38:14] <Cork> Translat-Embedde: ya, so why reload the page
[07:39:04] <Cork> just fetch the data you want from the server and update the page
[07:42:19] <Translat-Embedde> Cork:im testing if is my coding is ok and cleaning
[07:42:58] <Cork> not sure how that is an answer
[07:43:43] <Cork> Translat-Embedde: to continue with the answer i gave you before, the problem with storing the dom state in the browser is that visitors can't have more then one tab open
[07:43:49] <Cork> as the state will leake between the tabs
[07:44:08] <bestdesign> "company name, company identification number,comany tax identification number"
[07:44:14] <bestdesign> is needed for neter a company?
[07:44:19] <bestdesign> enter
[07:44:32] <Cork> bestdesign: yes it is
[07:45:38] <Cork> at least if you need to verify that the company is a "real" company
[07:47:16] <Translat-Embedde> i dont know how eliminating showing hidden elements who show in term if radiobutton is checked and not in page reload
[07:48:01] <Cork> Translat-Embedde: normally the server sets the sates correctly related to the values it puts in the forms
[07:48:18] <bestdesign> Translat-Embedde: jsfiddle.net
[07:48:23] <bestdesign> make example there what you want
[07:48:54] <Cork> ya, been a bit too much guessing here
[07:54:51] <bestdesign> i got an idea for myself
[07:54:57] <bestdesign> do a Company name field
[07:55:06] <bestdesign> and that is filled then show extra field for company
[07:55:11] <bestdesign> to not be that much info at once
[08:03:04] <Translat-Embedde> im using html hidden in input elements and worked :D
[08:03:21] <Translat-Embedde> and jquery using show function
[08:47:42] <bestdesign> lol
[16:00:58] <jak2000> hi all, chrome web tools (debug) https://pasteboard.co/J2U2r4j.png    how to know which errors was? only see 2 errors.. but not know...
[16:05:13] <shoky_> jak2000: look in the console. remove the filter (sidebar). click the red error count
[16:10:04] <jak2000> yes understand in console tab too not see the message wait
[16:12:39] <jak2000> https://pasteboard.co/J2U7NhC.png
[16:13:07] <jak2000> done
[16:13:21] <jak2000> why the filter side bar?
[16:57:10] <shoky_> jak2000: just in case the filter is causing it to not show certain errors..
[16:59:44] <jak2000> okay thanks
[17:01:01] <jak2000> other thing: i have this jquery code: https://jsfiddle.net/jamiguel77/o79qmctn/1/      where xEmbIni=250 and xEmbFin=300    the line 13: always open a window with: window.open("../servletRegenera?idocId="+i, "_blank");  where i always is 300  (open 50 windows with i=300 how to fix the loop?
[17:05:27] <jak2000> any advice?
[17:05:57] <shoky_> jak2000: the loop is finished by the time the first setTimeout callback is called.  after 5 seconds, i is already at the last value, the loop finishes immediately
[17:08:15] <shoky_> jak2000 this is how to fix that issue.. but your code is still weird or bad.. you’re doing multiple setTimeouts, all for 5 seconds from now. they will all run the same time. and `wresp = wresp` is wrong of course
[17:08:17] <shoky_> https://jsfiddle.net/zxvaqneh/
[17:12:56] <jak2000> `wresp = wresp`  is only for get a break...
[17:14:14] <jak2000> testing
[17:14:28] <shoky_> jak2000: i am guessing that you meant to do something like this.  to open a window only every 5 seconds. https://jsfiddle.net/zxvaqneh/1/
[17:16:56] <shoky_> er probably shouldn’t call the function `open` cause if that’s in a global scope it could overwrite window.open
[17:17:00] <shoky_> so rename it :p
[17:17:17] <jak2000> ok
[17:44:11] <jak2000> worked
[17:50:05] <jak2000> shoky_ the second code: strange: http://localhost:8080/jinvmanz/wwwembarques/287
[17:50:17] <jak2000> not add: servletRegenera?idocId=
[17:50:18] <jak2000> why?
[17:53:43] <shoky_> jak2000: huh?
[17:57:03] <jak2000> renamed open to openbrowser function ok?
[17:59:24] <jak2000> with openbroser open 1 window whit this link: http://localhost:8080/jinvmanz/wwwembarques/287     but with these code: https://jsfiddle.net/zxvaqneh/   open 50 windows with whis link: http://localhost:8080/jinvmanz/servletRegenera?idocId=330   of course the 330 in other windows is 329 and so on....
[18:02:58] <jak2000> shoky_ ?
[18:19:01] <shoky_> jak2000: ok?
[18:22:55] <jak2000> expalined?
[18:22:59] <jak2000> undesrtand?
[18:25:27] <shoky_> nope
[18:25:48] <shoky_> show your updated code. explain the problem again
[18:27:41] <jak2000> not open every 5 seconds: https://jsfiddle.net/zxvaqneh/1/
[18:29:06] <shoky_> show your updated code........
[18:33:14] <shoky_> you probably didn’t rename it properly. you also need to change anywhere that it is called..
