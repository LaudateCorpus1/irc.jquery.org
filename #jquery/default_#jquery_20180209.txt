[03:27:55] <EugenA> I have click event, there I want to get the html() of child span.myclass
[03:29:06] <devi8> is that a question?
[03:30:05] <EugenA> yes, $(this).  ... ?
[03:30:20] <Cork> EugenA: what is the question?
[03:30:38] <Cork> "how you find the child element"?
[03:30:39] <devi8> $(this).children("span.myclass").html() ?
[03:30:46] <Cork> no not children
[03:30:51] <EugenA> thanks, this is what I need
[03:30:53] <devi8> why is that?
[03:31:02] <Cork> cause it will only look at direct children
[03:31:06] <Cork> most likely you want .find()
[03:31:12] <EugenA> yes, it is OK
[03:33:15] <devi8> Cork, do you know a graceful way to enable multiple sticky headers? https://codepen.io/Devi8in/pen/zRoyYz
[03:33:42] <Cork> devi8: position: sticky; ?
[03:34:09] <devi8> if you scroll down, you can see the section header and menu stay put until the next section comes up. Tried that...i'll look into it again.
[05:01:03] <EugenA> I have a list with elements, on click I do prepend new element in the top of the list: $('.selected-activities').prepend($new-line);
[05:01:28] <EugenA> I'd like to animate the prepend
[05:01:40] <Cork> that will add it to the top of the last .selected-activities
[05:01:42] <EugenA> for example with slidedown
[05:01:48] <Cork> not one to each one of them
[05:02:10] <EugenA> yes, it is OK, but it should appear with animation
[05:02:21] <Cork> also to animate you need to do new-line.hide() and append it and then animate it
[05:04:24] <EugenA> I tried this: $('.selected-activities').prepend($new-line.hide().slideDown());
[05:04:46] <EugenA> but you cannot see the animation
[05:17:33] <codecutter> how do i console log the output for the following drop down list (output only when user scrolls lists and makes a selection from list) https://jsfiddle.net/axe4jxr3/5/
[05:20:04] <Cork> EugenA: you can't run .slideDown() before you append it
[05:20:16] <Cork> that would make the .hide().slideDown() a noop
[05:21:12] <Cork> codecutter: // isn't a valid comment syntax for css
[05:21:17] <Cork> it only supports /* *7
[05:21:23] <Cork> * /* */
[05:22:50] <Cork> codecutter: also radio buttons without a value isn't valid

[09:30:58] <noobie_> hello. how can i remove everything from class "active" and then add the current selection to class "active"?
[09:33:02] <Cork> noobie_: add too class?
[09:33:09] <Cork> you mean find elements with the class?
[09:33:34] <noobie_> put elements into class "active"
[09:33:44] <Cork> you can't put an element in a class
[09:33:55] <Cork> you can add a class to an element not the other way around
[09:34:06] <Cork> classes has css properties
[09:34:31] <noobie_> not sure if i'm misusing the word element here
[09:34:34] <noobie_> maybe i mean object?
[09:34:48] <Cork> if you want to find all the elements with the class "active" and remove the class from those elements
[09:34:58] <Cork> you would write $('.active').removeClass('active')
[09:35:14] <Cork> you can't add elements to a class, you can only modify elements
[10:05:47] <poboy> crossposted in ##javascript but it's jquery.  anyone able to help me with chart.js?  I have an array "fundingRecieved" on line 110 and I'm trying to pass in the data to ministryData.ministry_funding.(group name here) line 135.    https://kopy.io/6iciU
[10:08:28] <skinux> Is there an extension that provides state with two-way binding?
[10:26:24] <devi8> poboy, can you explain better what you are trying to do?
[10:30:12] <poboy> devi8, these values default to 0.  When I loop through fundingReceived and try to add data to the correct array, instead of adding numbers += is appending the digits.    So default is 0, if one of these values is 181  the new amount becomes 0181   https://kopy.io/jDZTi
[10:32:16] <devi8> so if the number is zero, you want 0+181  ==181, right?? not 0181
[10:33:46] <devi8> I think you need to parse the characters into numbers to add them. use parseInt() or parseFloat() to get the values of the number strings...like 121, for example
[10:34:09] <devi8> line 121, for example. sorry
[10:35:27] <poboy> yes
[10:37:42] <devi8> so ministryData.ministry_funding.goProject+=parseFloat(fundingreceived.received_amount);
[10:37:59] <poboy> I should've realized that.  thank you
[11:11:14] <poboy> One more chart.js question before I fade into oblivion:  I have an array of months         this.months = ['Jan', 'Feb', 'Mar', 'Apr', 'May', 'Jun', 'Jul', 'Aug', 'Sep', 'Oct', 'Nov', 'Dec'];  And I need to display them in a rolling 12 month fashion, so Feb should be at the far right.  What do I need to change for the labels?  labels: this.months
[11:29:09] <chasepeeler> prev(selector) will give me my immediate previous sibling, or, nothing if that sibiling doesn't match the selector.......   prevUntil(selector) will give me all of my previous siblings until (and not including) one that matches the selector......... so, if I want to get the FIRST previous sibling that matches a selector, where there could by 0+ siblings between them, how do I do that?
[11:29:09] <chasepeeler> prevUntil(selector).last().prev()?
[11:30:49] <chasepeeler> prevAll(selector).last()
[11:32:20] <chasepeeler> wait, prevAll(selector).first()
[11:46:13] <toothe> I am using this plugin to do some features on my site. I want to "hook" one of the default behaviors so that my code is executed first ,then the default function. Is that doable?
[11:46:25] <toothe> Without having to rewrite the library?
[11:46:28] <toothe> or rather, hack the library?
[12:01:40] <shoky> toothe: totally depends on the plugin and how it's coded, there's no general answer
[12:02:38] <toothe> i guess my question is, is over-riding default behavior possible?
[12:04:03] <shoky> same answer

[12:48:30] <Gh0st_Preacher> goooooood morning, jquery
[13:51:03] <thomas_25> .on('load', ..) only works on window here
[13:51:11] <thomas_25> not on divs or anything else for that mtter
[13:51:22] <robertmaxrees> thomas_25 it works for iframes and images, too.
[13:51:27] <robertmaxrees> so long as you bind before they load.
[13:51:46] <thomas_25> i've tried to bind it before the body as well
[13:51:51] <robertmaxrees> right.
[13:51:51] <thomas_25> still no go...
[13:51:54] <robertmaxrees> doersn't work that way.
[13:51:57] <robertmaxrees> the load event is really only for stuff that requires a separate network request.
[13:52:06] <robertmaxrees> normal elements are generally apart of the page.
[13:52:18] <thomas_25> i have a div with a bunch of imgs
[13:52:28] <thomas_25> i want to run a logic when all imgs in the div is loaded

[13:52:58] <robertmaxrees> i'd check out the caveats
[13:53:10] <thomas_25> i thought i did.. but apparently i skimmmed too fast :0
[13:53:28] <robertmaxrees> so the question becomes, what do you want to do after the images load?

[17:11:30] <RonaldsMazitis> I try to get it
[17:11:31] <RonaldsMazitis> with
[17:11:39] <RonaldsMazitis> var last_post_date2 = $(e.target).find('#pedejaisdate').val();
[17:12:22] <robertmaxrees> you can shorten that to just $('#pedejaisdate').val(); btw
[17:13:47] <RonaldsMazitis> https://paste.ee/p/0xv7Y
[17:14:04] <RonaldsMazitis> it gives me undefined
[17:14:10] <RonaldsMazitis> or nothing
[17:14:20] <robertmaxrees> thjat means that element either doesn't exist or doesn't have a value.
[17:14:28] <robertmaxrees> also: divs don't usually have values.
[17:14:33] <robertmaxrees> you sure you don't want .text(); ?
[17:16:25] <RonaldsMazitis> there is value
[17:16:33] <robertmaxrees> not on divs.
[17:16:38] <robertmaxrees> inputs have values.
[17:16:41] <robertmaxrees> divs don't.
[17:16:51] <robertmaxrees> and if you're setting one with .val(), that's not a good idea.
[17:17:01] <RonaldsMazitis> $.get( "pedejaisdate", function( data ) {
[17:17:01] <RonaldsMazitis>   $( "#pedejaisdate" ).html( data );
[17:17:01] <RonaldsMazitis> });
[17:17:06] <taplar_> div's have no value?  bold statement robert...
[17:17:10] <robertmaxrees> lol
[17:17:14] <robertmaxrees> RonaldsMazitis that's not a value.
[17:17:23] <robertmaxrees> .val() is for input value="foo"
[17:17:27] <robertmaxrees> you want the .html()
[17:17:51] <RonaldsMazitis> <div id="pedejaisdate" style="visibility: hidden"></div>
[17:17:55] <robertmaxrees> right.
[17:17:59] <robertmaxrees> you're setting the HTML.
[17:18:00] <robertmaxrees> not the value.
[17:18:08] <skinux> I'm looking for some advice. I'm trying to develop my own app with the same purpose as applymate.com. However, I want to show most fields of each application as if it were either Excel or Calc spreadsheet document. Where I'm needing advice is writing the simplest script to track data from all fields, of each application, being able to manage, send, receive each application (to/from server) as an object.
[17:18:48] <skinux> I'm aware I'm talking about writing state management. I don't want to mess with learning some library or plugin, but rather to learn and understand to write the code myself.
[17:19:08] <robertmaxrees> skinux i'd highly recommend hitting up ##javascript for that.
[17:19:23] <skinux> Well, I wanted to use jQuery for DOM
[17:19:44] <robertmaxrees> skinux heh, that comes after you figure out your state management.
[17:19:51] <robertmaxrees> i'd also avoid jquery for this particular use tbh.
[17:19:51] <skinux> Okay.
[17:20:00] <RonaldsMazitis> so I have to        	   var last_post_date2 = document.getElementById("pedejaisdate").innerHTML;
[17:20:05] <skinux> May I ask why, specifically, that you do not recommend jquery?
[17:20:07] <RonaldsMazitis> and then value?
[17:20:10] <robertmaxrees> RonaldsMazitis you can use .html()
[17:20:20] <robertmaxrees> $("#yourid').html() to get the value.
[17:20:29] <robertmaxrees> skinux it's not a templating engine.
[17:20:49] <robertmaxrees> skinux you're really looking for something like flux + react, but you said you want to hand-roll it.
[17:21:00] <robertmaxrees> jquery is gfoing to be terribly inefficient and hard to wrangle for that job.
[17:21:28] <skinux> Well, it's rather easy to setup event handling for field changes, and inserting/modifying field data is also something jquery is good for, is it not?
[17:22:02] <skinux> Okay. In that case I appreciate you not tooting the horn and pointing me away instead.
[17:22:10] <robertmaxrees> sure, but you also want to sync state between the server and client.
[17:22:39] <robertmaxrees> I'm not saying it can't be done with jquery, just that you'll quickly run into use cases where you'd be better served with something build for exactly that.
[17:23:10] <skinux> Okay. So, I just need to learn how to build a state manager specifically, then put the DOM on top or parallel to that?
[17:23:18] <robertmaxrees> erm./
[17:23:20] <RonaldsMazitis> I cannot alert         	   var last_post_date2 = $("#pedejaisdate'").html();
[17:23:29] <robertmaxrees> RonaldsMazitis you have an extra ' in there.
[17:23:35] <RonaldsMazitis> ah
[17:23:49] <robertmaxrees> "the dom on top or parallel" - neither.
[17:23:50] <RonaldsMazitis> still no value
[17:23:57] <robertmaxrees> RonaldsMazitis make a fiddle then duder.
[17:24:19] <skinux> Anyway.  If plain javascript state manager should be my first priority, I'll just do some research on writing one.
[17:24:20] <robertmaxrees> skinux you need to learn how to manage state and then how you'll render that to the dom and sync changes.
[17:24:22] <skinux> Thanks
[17:24:31] <skinux> Okay. thanks again
[17:24:35] <robertmaxrees> why not just use one of the many libs th-

[17:37:15] <robertmaxrees> ...
[17:37:21] <RonaldsMazitis> maybe wrong jquery version
[17:37:32] <robertmaxrees> your fiddle and your page don't match up.
[17:37:35] <robertmaxrees> soemthing is amiss here.
[17:38:27] <RonaldsMazitis> https://ibb.co/jV4cLc
[17:38:54] <robertmaxrees> what's at line 793 of posts.js?
[17:39:41] <RonaldsMazitis> not that many lines
[17:39:58] <robertmaxrees> click on that posts:793 and see where it takes you.
[17:43:06] <RonaldsMazitis> with innerhtml that does not show
[17:43:14] <robertmaxrees> so here's the issue.
[17:43:21] <robertmaxrees> something is obviously broken, but I can't read minds.
[17:44:26] <RonaldsMazitis> var last_post_date23 = document.getElementById("#pedejaisdate").innerHTML;
[17:44:38] <robertmaxrees> 2 errors in there.
[17:44:54] <robertmaxrees> just do $('#pedejaisdate').html();
[17:44:57] <robertmaxrees> done.
[17:44:58] <RonaldsMazitis> Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'innerHTML' of null
[17:45:08] <robertmaxrees> right because document.getElementById("#pedejaisdate"). is wrong.
[17:46:18] <RonaldsMazitis>         	   var last_post_date2 = $('#pedejaisdate').html();
[17:46:23] <robertmaxrees> sure
[17:46:25] <RonaldsMazitis> trying this and same results
[17:46:30] <robertmaxrees> the same error?
[17:48:10] <RonaldsMazitis> yea
[17:48:17] <robertmaxrees> with innerHTML?
[17:48:35] <robertmaxrees> sorry, it's really hard to help since I don't have your page in front of me.
[17:48:42] <robertmaxrees> so you'll gotta give me more than that heh
[17:49:52] <RonaldsMazitis> var last_post_date2 = document.getElementById('#pedejaisdate').innerHTML;
[17:49:53] <RonaldsMazitis> same
[17:49:57] <robertmaxrees> dude.
[17:50:02] <robertmaxrees> like I said, that line has errors.
[17:50:14] <robertmaxrees> document.getElementById('#pedejaisdate').innerHTML; will break every time.
[17:50:34] <robertmaxrees> document.getElementById('pedejaisdate').innerHTML *might* work if the element exists.
[17:50:44] <robertmaxrees> but since you're using jquery, use the version i keep showing you :)
[17:51:11] <robertmaxrees> if $('#pedejaisdate').html() returns an empty string, then the div has nothing in it.
[17:51:22] <robertmaxrees> the screenshots showed that the server response looks empty.
[17:52:08] <RonaldsMazitis> it reloads every 7000 miliseconds
[17:52:29] <RonaldsMazitis> it is there but not in time
[17:52:36] <robertmaxrees> lol
[17:52:48] <robertmaxrees> what happens if you kill the interval
[17:52:53] <robertmaxrees> and then wait and then give it a tryu.
[17:53:45] <RonaldsMazitis> kinda alerts me with the date I asked but gets me to empty page again
[17:53:56] <robertmaxrees> i don't know what that means.
[17:54:08] <RonaldsMazitis> I need to trim the value maybe
[17:54:19] <robertmaxrees> (shrug)
[17:55:32] <cmrabet> Any reason why .html() strips tr/td tags off????
[17:55:41] <robertmaxrees> cmrabet shouldn't be.
[17:56:21] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/482243d8/ cmrabet
[17:56:25] <robertmaxrees> ^ see?
[17:56:54] <cmrabet> robertmaxrees, not working for me
[17:57:01] <robertmaxrees> cmrabet in the fiddle?
[17:57:04] <robertmaxrees> or...?
[17:57:25] <RonaldsMazitis> posts:745
[17:57:36] <robertmaxrees> RonaldsMazitis dunno what that means./
[17:57:41] <RonaldsMazitis> 2018/02/09/22/31/20
[17:57:43] <cmrabet> robertmaxrees, in my code, I do a find first to find the block, then once found, I do .html, and I get everything except tr and td..
[17:57:48] <RonaldsMazitis> and a lot of white space
[17:57:49] <cmrabet> my tr and td are not inside table
[17:57:53] <cmrabet> they are inside a span
[17:58:07] <robertmaxrees> cmrabet that's why.
[17:58:10] <cmrabet> I'm doing templating
[17:58:10] <robertmaxrees> that's not valid.
[17:58:21] <robertmaxrees> trs must be in a table.
[17:58:28] <cmrabet> I know it's not valid, but the intention is to embed the tr in a valid table
[17:58:31] <robertmaxrees> if not, the browser changes things our from under you.
[17:58:38] <robertmaxrees> jquery can't do anything about it.
[17:58:41] <cmrabet> ah
[17:58:45] <cmrabet> ok
[17:58:54] <robertmaxrees> why is it in a span?
[18:00:15] <cmrabet> robertmaxrees, because I have chunks of templates in spans that are hideen
[18:00:27] <robertmaxrees> cmrabet but why?>
[18:00:31] <cmrabet> I find them with .find, clone them, populate them and then I insert in visible tables
[18:00:36] <robertmaxrees> why not just do them in jquery objects/fragments?
[18:00:41] <robertmaxrees> ah.
[18:00:54] <cmrabet> because I want to separate HTML from logic, for styling issues
[18:01:02] <cmrabet> I don't want to create any HTML from JS
[18:01:28] <robertmaxrees> i'd still pop the templates into script tags or JSON objects or something else instead.
[18:01:46] <cmrabet> so I define all my HTML chunks in my HTML DOM, I hide them, and then from JS I call the chunks, clone them, populate them with values, and inert them into valid tables and such
[18:02:02] <robertmaxrees> you mean in your market, yeah?
[18:02:09] <robertmaxrees> *markup
[18:02:24] <cmrabet> I work all the time in React, I don't have this problem normally, this is a jquery project I'm helping a coworker with, pain the ass, sorry jQuery lovers :)
[18:02:37] <robertmaxrees> that's because you're doing templating with jquery ;)
[18:02:42] <robertmaxrees> terrible for that job.
[18:02:59] <cmrabet> yep
[18:03:19] <robertmaxrees> no need to apologize for somebody using it wrong :D
[18:04:58] <RonaldsMazitis> var last_post_date2 = last_post_date .replace(/(^\s+|\s+$)/g,'');
[18:05:00] <RonaldsMazitis> this worked
[18:05:13] <robertmaxrees> RonaldsMazitis are you strying to trim whitespace?
[18:05:27] <RonaldsMazitis> yea found something fast
[18:05:34] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[18:05:35] <robertmaxrees> lol.
[18:05:35] <RonaldsMazitis> got to go sleep
[18:05:37] <robertmaxrees> .trim()
[18:05:48] <robertmaxrees> $('#id').html().trim() ;)
[19:17:53] <lissitzki_> hi
[19:18:04] <robertmaxrees> good afternoon!
[19:18:17] <lissitzki_> here is night
[19:18:23] <lissitzki_> europe
[19:18:37] <lissitzki_> 1.20
[19:18:43] <lissitzki_> anyway
[19:19:06] <lissitzki_> i'm still working on my menu, damn
[19:19:11] <lissitzki_> https://jsfiddle.net/el_lissitzki/9xfzLdsm/
[19:19:13] <robertmaxrees> lol
[19:19:33] <lissitzki_> i don't know why the click on the jquery is not working
[19:19:45] <lissitzki_> i suppose the selector is not accurate
[19:20:13] <lissitzki_> but from the html structure is that what i retrieve
[19:20:58] <robertmaxrees> do you want this for the link-menu elements?
[19:21:22] <lissitzki_> yes
[19:21:44] <robertmaxrees> so for starters, change your handler
[19:21:49] <robertmaxrees> to be $('.has-children .link-menu')
[19:22:35] <robertmaxrees> err, wait.
[19:22:56] <robertmaxrees> sorry, lookign closer.
[19:23:01] <robertmaxrees> not fully getting the struycture here.
[19:23:40] <robertmaxrees> aaaah, the link-menu anchors are the hjidden ones.
[19:23:44] <lissitzki_> yes
[19:26:01] <robertmaxrees> okay, so instead of that .parenmt().children(), you want to go to the closest .has-children, then .find() all .link-menu a elements.
[19:26:16] <robertmaxrees> and show those.
[19:26:48] <lissitzki_> ok
[19:26:53] <robertmaxrees> make sense?
[19:26:55] <lissitzki_> so the handler is ok?
[19:27:04] <lissitzki_> just to make one thing at time
[19:27:16] <robertmaxrees> it should be.
[19:27:24] <lissitzki_> how you told me
[19:27:25] <lissitzki_> ok
[19:27:53] <lissitzki_> so actually $(this) needs to go first to the closest has-children
[19:28:00] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[19:28:02] <lissitzki_> how do i do that?
[19:28:09] <lissitzki_> no?
[19:28:13] <robertmaxrees> you need to use .closest instead of .parent
[19:28:21] <robertmaxrees> and pass .has-children as a selector.
[19:28:45] <lissitzki_> all right
[19:28:53] <robertmaxrees> and then find instead of children
[19:28:58] <robertmaxrees> children only goes down one level.
[19:29:50] <lissitzki_> https://jsfiddle.net/el_lissitzki/9xfzLdsm/17/
[19:29:55] <lissitzki_> not working
[19:30:39] <robertmaxrees> "and pass .has-children as a selector."
[19:31:06] <robertmaxrees> and you need to use  .link-menu a as the selector for find
[19:31:16] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/9xfzLdsm/18/
[19:31:18] <robertmaxrees> gotta jet.
[19:32:37] <lissitzki_> great
[19:33:11] <lissitzki_> slowly by slowly getting to the point
[19:33:34] <lissitzki_> it is tough
[19:33:55] <lissitzki_> starting from 0
[19:33:59] <lissitzki_> anyway
[19:34:06] <lissitzki_> thanks
[19:34:21] <lissitzki_> what is preventDefuault for?
[20:51:53] <deepfreez> Hi, know anyone how to solve this: https://paste.laravel.io/184ce16a-6e81-4e6f-84e8-05cdcf1313d9 , I have a + button and this add me a new input.. but I want to change the number of the input POST 5 , POST 6..
[22:05:01] <TheRinger> o
[22:06:51] <TheRinger> how does one return a socketio output to html without creating a newline everytime, (instead just replacing current line)
[22:36:29] <sadtaco> What's the modern alternative to something like jquery ui that uses native inputs and such?  IE attaching a slider to an input field where it simply hides the input, and using the slider updates the input, keeping the usual input change and submit events and such.
