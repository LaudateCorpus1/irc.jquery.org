[04:13:39] <Intelo> How do I send ajax call to https://api.somewhere.tld to post these values?  https://jsfiddle.net/19qtLr68/
[04:13:59] <Intelo> I just need to send 2 values
[04:18:56] <Cork> Intelo: the server has to be configured to support that
[04:19:43] <Cork> for a simple post you have to enable cors origin on the server (for OPTIONS requests)
[04:20:08] <Cork> alternatively you post it to the same domain you load your page from, and proxy it server side
[04:21:15] <Cork> if you just want to fetch data (not change, and if it hits a cache so the server never sees the request is ok) you can just put it in params in a get request
[04:21:42] <Cork> (as jsonp)
[04:22:06] <Cork> though that means the server needs to support answering jsonp requests
[04:24:18] <Intelo_> How do I send ajax call to https://api.somewhere.tld to post these values?  https://jsfiddle.net/19qtLr68/
[04:24:38] <Cork> see the channel log
[04:25:52] <Intelo_> new url https://jsfiddle.net/19qtLr68/3/
[04:26:54] <Intelo_> Cork,  I saw it. Ignore server. and COrs for now. Just frontend jquery
[04:30:55] <Intelo_> Cork, ?
[04:55:03] <Intelo_> https://jsfiddle.net/19qtLr68/5/
[04:55:25] <Intelo_> is this good enough to present to a senior or interview? https://jsfiddle.net/19qtLr68/5
[05:03:57] <Uhkis> no
[05:04:22] <Intelo_> Uhkis, whats defficient?
[05:06:01] <Uhkis> pointless comments, using click on submit instead of form submit, bad indentation, check documentation on form serialization and the whole thing is inline instead of a separate file
[05:06:15] <Uhkis> those come to mind without a further inspection
[05:07:09] <Cork> and he didn't like that answer either i see
[05:07:48] <Uhkis> well, i guess he doesn't want the job then :D
[05:07:58] <Cork> nope >_>
[05:08:12] <Cork> and takes price for ungratefullness
[05:08:32] <Cork> "i don't like what you said so i'm going to ignore it"
[05:09:08] <Uhkis> but that's how kids are raised these days
[05:09:28] <Uhkis> "it's not you, dear child. world is wrong"
[05:10:23] <Cork> point
[06:27:49] <undefined_bob> agreed
[11:01:20] <taplar> 5 hours to go...
[11:02:13] <robertmaxrees> lucky.
[11:02:18] <robertmaxrees> i've got a loooong day ahead of me.
[11:06:05] <taplar> we got 2 hours early off
[11:07:01] <robertmaxrees> niiiiice
[11:07:30] <taplar> i sent out a group message to some people who were not here when we got the notice, that they had to work 2 more hours to cover for the time off
[11:07:40] <taplar> supposedly one of the new guys almost took it seriously
[11:07:55] <robertmaxrees> lol
[12:16:36] <robertmaxrees> https://userinyerface.com/ >:)
[12:17:45] <taplar> egh, what it this?
[12:18:35] <robertmaxrees> a game that show you things you SHOULDN'T do.
[12:18:44] <taplar> it instantly made me angry
[12:18:57] <taplar> lol
[12:19:05] <robertmaxrees> :)
[12:19:44] <robertmaxrees> next time somebody comes in here trying to get a checkbox to behave like a radio or vice versa, just link 'em that :D
[12:25:37] <Cork> lol, damn that one is good
[12:25:49] <Cork> robertmaxrees: thx, i needed that (been hard last few days)
[12:29:28] <robertmaxrees> :) glad to give you a little bost.
[12:29:33] <robertmaxrees> *boost
[12:32:00] <taplar> anyone else click on one of the input fields and the "placeholder" didn't disappear, and almost WTF out loud?
[12:32:14] <robertmaxrees> hahahahahaha
[12:32:30] <Cork> yup :)
[12:32:48] <Cork> and the tld dropdown doesn't go away when it loses focus
[12:32:56] <Cork> (not to forget the other)
[12:35:42] <Cork> sadly the "placeholder" problem is something i've hit way WAY to many times on inputfields of shops
[12:36:24] <Cork> and that dampened the reaction quite a bit, though it was still GAH
[12:36:37] <taplar> i feel like we used to have backend code on some apps to handle for IE sending the placeholder as an actual value
[12:37:01] <Cork> ie11 if i remember correctly
[13:15:24] <taplar> my team is loving the website
[13:21:46] <remyo> How can I wrap all text after a specific character inside of an element. For example. If the text was Object: Value, how would I only wrap Value?
[13:22:22] <remyo> Basically everything after :
[13:22:26] <robertmaxrees> $('<div>').append(theText.split(':')[1])
[13:22:44] <robertmaxrees> some variation on the ^
[13:22:46] <robertmaxrees> *this
[13:23:07] <thykka> remyo, CSS can't look for individual characters, but there's <wbr>, and containing the text parts into their own elements..
[13:23:17] <robertmaxrees> >.>
[13:23:30] <taplar> or like theText.replace('Value', '<span>Value</span>')
[13:23:36] <robertmaxrees> ^ or this.
[13:23:39] <robertmaxrees> lots of wayus.
[13:23:41] <robertmaxrees> *ways
[13:24:23] <taplar> thykka what does css have to do with the question?
[13:25:50] <remyo> robertmaxrees: That pretty much works, thanks!!!
[13:25:56] <thykka> layout-related things would generally fall under CSS, rather than tweaking things with js, but in this case that's not an option
[13:26:05] <remyo> I just replaced append with wrap and I’m all good. Thanks
[13:26:46] <taplar> css would normall deal with styling the elements.  manipulating the dom i would never associate with css
[13:27:09] <thykka> right, but ideally this should need no DOM manipulation, rather than fixing the HTML output itself
[13:27:27] <robertmaxrees> i mean, if the server could render it properly the first time, sure.
[13:27:40] <thykka> that should always be the first route to inspect, imo
[13:27:41] <taplar> yep, but that's an entirely different issue than the question and your proposed solution
[13:27:55] <robertmaxrees> thykka sure - but maybe there's a reason that wasn't done in this case :)
[13:28:00] <thykka> <wbr> is my proposed solution, or wrapping them server-side..
[13:28:10] <thykka> i was not aware of such a reason
[13:28:15] <taplar> no one is
[13:28:15] <robertmaxrees> lmao
[13:28:18] <taplar> no one asked
[13:28:24] <taplar> kinda the poinot
[13:28:27] <taplar> *point
[13:29:01] <thykka> perhaps it didn't come to mind? The question smells like XY to me..
[13:29:09] <thykka> but whatever, you guys got this..
[13:29:36] <robertmaxrees> you can also answer the question, and then follow up with "but I would suggest doing X or Y instead."
[13:29:43] <robertmaxrees> :)
[13:29:55] <remyo> I appreciate everyone’s take, thanks all
[13:30:00] <taplar> "is there a reason you're not doing X?"
[13:30:10] <robertmaxrees> ^ :)
[14:25:27] <Flyste> I have a instance where I'm using $(this).html() when clicked triggers an ajax call, but in the ajax call $(this).html() is undefined.  I created a variable buttonhtml = $(this).html(), but now I'm trying to change the html from within the ajax call.
[14:25:57] <taplar> ok, so one of two ways you can do this
[14:25:58] <Flyste> What would normally be $(this).html('new html');, but I don't know the syntax to do that with the buttonhtml variable
[14:25:59] <taplar> at least
[14:26:10] <robertmaxrees> Flyste generally, people store 'this' in a var and reference that.
[14:26:13] <taplar> you can either set a var outside the ajax to equal this, and use taht inside
[14:26:16] <robertmaxrees> or .bind(this) on the function
[14:26:20] <taplar> or you can use the context option on the ajax call
[14:26:31] <robertmaxrees> ^ or a third option :)
[14:26:46] <taplar> or use an arrow function for the callback that will not adjust context
[14:26:56] <robertmaxrees> yar.
[14:27:02] <robertmaxrees> lots of choices :)
[14:27:06] <taplar> yup yup
[14:27:13] <Flyste> Oh I think I see..
[14:27:33] <Flyste> I should be assigning $(this) to a variable, not $(this).html()
[14:27:39] <taplar> yep
[14:27:39] <robertmaxrees> that's one way.
[14:27:59] <taplar> the result of html() is no longer connected to the dom
[14:28:02] <taplar> it's just a string
[14:29:17] <Flyste> Ok that did it, thank you
[17:42:09] <ismarkup> hello, I have a dynamic menu that I would like to tweak. There's some li's that have some other content other than just an <a> tag (maybe there's a submenu inside it. And there's other li that only have a nested <a>. I need to point to those who just have a nested <a> within it. Any ideas?
[17:42:11] <ismarkup> thanks
[17:42:28] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[17:42:44] <robertmaxrees> can you show what you have in a fiddle?
[17:44:20] <robertmaxrees> ismarkup ^
[17:45:58] <ismarkup> hey! thanks! I haven't done a fiddle yet, I was just wondering how to make a conditional in this case. Like..ask if there's something else other than an <a> tag within that <li> or just an <a> tag...makes sense?
[17:46:20] <robertmaxrees> that's why i'm asking to see example markup.
[17:46:24] <robertmaxrees> your request is strange :)
[17:46:37] <ismarkup> haha
[17:47:02] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/ just pop your html in the upper left corner, click "save", and share out the url for the new page :)
[17:47:18] <ismarkup> yeah, let's do that I'll share the structure
[17:47:20] <ismarkup> thanks
[17:49:27] <robertmaxrees> should be pretty straightforward :)
[17:52:46] <robertmaxrees> there an issue?
[18:48:49] <robertmaxrees> ismarkup did you figure it out?
[19:37:43] <drei> hi all
[19:37:57] <robertmaxrees> hello :)
[19:38:40] <drei> what the best way to change the order of elements in query?
[19:38:49] <drei> I have something like this  - http://jsfiddle.net/Lwmkc3f4/
[19:39:23] <robertmaxrees> "in query"?
[19:39:25] <drei> eg. onload I want to display 'reading' before 'listening'
[19:39:27] <drei> yeah
[19:39:38] <drei> or javascript either way
[19:39:40] <robertmaxrees> why not just output the markup correctly from your backend?
[19:41:10] <drei> it needs to change the order based on a parent class although I can do that bit
[19:41:35] <robertmaxrees> that... doesn't answer my question? lol
[19:42:38] <drei> outputting from the backend is unrelated at this stage
[19:42:58] <robertmaxrees> "onload I want to display 'reading' before 'listening'"
[19:43:07] <drei> I just need to change the order of the elements in jquery/ js
[19:43:53] <drei> yeah as the order in the html is listening/ reading (I want to change it to reading/ listening)
[19:44:17] <drei> is there a way to switch the two?
[19:44:18] <robertmaxrees> i'm saying you should correct this server-side.
[19:44:44] <robertmaxrees> if you want to do it the wrong way and have things move after the page loads, you could also just .detach() the particular element then insertBefore() or insertAfter()
[19:45:35] <drei> ok
[19:45:46] <robertmaxrees> but i would seriously advise agianst doing that.
[19:46:29] <drei> I know
[19:46:38] <robertmaxrees> why can't you fix that instead?
[19:46:50] <drei> I will
[19:46:54] <robertmaxrees> lmao
[19:46:56] <robertmaxrees> 'kay....
[19:46:56] <drei> thanks
[19:46:58] <drei> LOL
[19:47:07] <robertmaxrees> dunno why you're wasting my time then.
