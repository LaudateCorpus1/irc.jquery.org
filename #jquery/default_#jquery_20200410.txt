[00:08:17] <Inazad> I want to get the content of an iframe, I do $('#templateFrame').contents().find("html").html();    but If I modify something in the iFrame (like a input value), I don't get the updated html content.... how to ?
[13:58:32] <ralphyJ> hello?
[15:04:47] <pelikansalat> Cheers guys! I have a question about jQuery and delegate event handlers. It was my understanding that passing a selector to .on() would be similar to omitting it and simply doing $(event.currentTarget).is(...) in the event handler body.
[15:05:58] <pelikansalat> I recently tried to register a click handler for all links with a given class and failed to do so by registering the event handler on the window object using $(window).on('click', '.my-class', event => { ... }).
[15:12:42] <pelikansalat> Given the following example, https://codepen.io/smares/pen/rNOBZRK?editors=1111, why doesn't $(window).on('click', '.some-class', event => { ... }) capture the click event when the link is clicked?
[15:13:31] <pelikansalat> But $(document).on('click', '.some-class', event => { ... }) does.
[15:15:38] <shoky_> pelikansalat: events bubble up to document, not to the window object
[15:18:25] <pelikansalat> But why does $(window).on('click', event => { ... }) without a selector capture the click event and event.target has a reference to the clicked element?
[15:27:13] <shoky_> pelikansalat: ok i remembered wrong so scratch my previous statement. i guess itâ€™s just jquery allowing delegation only up to document, treating it as the proper DOM tree root
[15:34:31] <bestdesign> what is .target do?
