[02:20:37] <newbsduser> ajax http "post (canceled)" 10.00s
[02:20:59] <newbsduser> i tried to set timeout:10000 and script's set_time_limit = 0. and max_execution_time = 10000 too
[02:21:11] <newbsduser> how can i solve it?
[02:40:35] <brunoais> newbsduser, not enough info
[02:40:48] <brunoais> I don't even know what you are trying to do
[02:43:01] <Voyage> How do I get the value entered in a form input field?   alert ( $("#input-field-id").val       )  ?
[02:43:11] <beancurd> val.()
[02:43:14] <beancurd> val()
[02:43:28] <beancurd> $('myselector').val()
[02:43:29] <Voyage> k
[02:44:26] <beancurd> also, use console.log instead of alert.
[02:44:31] <beancurd> all the cool kids do it.
[02:45:44] <Voyage> beancurd,  I did alert ( $("#memberID").val()  ) ;       on  https://www.cathaypacific.com/cx/en_HK/book-a-trip/redeem-flights/asia-miles-flight-award-redemption-login.html?loginreferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cathaypacific.com%2Fcx%2Fen_HK%2Fbook-a-trip%2Fredeem-flights%2Fasia-miles-flight-award-redemption.html&status=NO_ACCESS            and it tells me "Membership No"    which is wrong and not the text that I just entered
[02:46:28] <beancurd> heh. that's a long ass url :D
[02:46:58] <Voyage> yes it is
[02:47:28] <Voyage> beancurd,  try this one https://www.cathaypacific.com/cx/en_HK/book-a-trip/redeem-flights/asia-miles-flight-award-redemption.html
[02:48:31] <beancurd> hehe.
[02:48:44] <beancurd> there's 2 elements with #memberid...
[02:48:50] <brunoais> Voyage, why is the element with class: "pageContentOverlay"
[02:49:06] <brunoais> posiitoned absolute and moved -10000px to the left?
[02:49:08] <Voyage> hm..
[02:49:14] <beancurd> up top... haha.
[02:49:18] <Voyage> oh God
[02:49:18] <beancurd> in the header...
[02:49:26] <beancurd> that's what your selector is picking up.
[02:49:33] <Voyage> so how do I capture the correct one
[02:49:39] <Voyage> no . actually
[02:49:54] <Voyage> its picking <input title="Membership No." type="text" value="" id="memberID" name="memberID" maxLength="25" class="{us
[02:50:01] <Voyage> its picking the title.  why?
[02:50:10] <Voyage> title instead of val()
[02:50:14] <beancurd> nah.
[02:50:17] <Voyage> hm
[02:50:22] <beancurd> type something in the membership at the top.
[02:50:27] <beancurd> then run your js again.
[02:50:58] <Voyage> I did typed
[02:50:59] <brunoais> Voyage, why do you have 3 jQuery?
[02:51:10] <Voyage> 3 jquery?
[02:51:15] <brunoais> yeah
[02:51:16] <brunoais> 3
[02:51:25] <beancurd> is this even something you're working on? or are you just tring to automate input for something.
[02:51:47] <brunoais> this page takes so loooooong to load
[02:51:57] <Voyage> ya.. i know
[02:52:10] <brunoais> try this:
[02:52:13] <beancurd> Voyage: $(".hint").eq(2).val();
[02:52:14] <Voyage> well, I did filled up the form. still the .val() shows me Membership id
[02:52:16] <brunoais> redice the amount of javascript
[02:52:19] <brunoais> *reduce
[02:52:20] <beancurd> use that.
[02:52:30] <Voyage> whats .eq
[02:52:39] <d0de> How can I grab the contents of an RSS feed with jQuery without getting the "No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header" problem? I'd like to be able to grab arbitrary RSS feeds without using any plugins or public proxies. I wouldn't mind setting up a private proxy, but I don't know how to do that
[02:52:41] <brunoais> Voyage, that's to get the 2nd element in the set
[02:52:42] <beancurd> 0 indexed element.
[02:52:51] <beancurd> third actually.
[02:53:06] <brunoais> beancurd, ups, yes
[02:53:15] <brunoais> d0de, that's impossible
[02:53:23] <Voyage> brunoais,  this says "alert ( $(".hint").eq(2).val()   ) ;"
[02:53:26] <brunoais> d0de, It's not managed by jQuery, that's managed by the browser
[02:53:27] <beancurd> haha.
[02:53:31] <Voyage> brunoais,  this says "alert ( $(".hint").eq(2).val()   ) ;"         "PIN"
[02:54:27] <brunoais> Voyage, why do you have so many inputs?
[02:54:44] <brunoais> if you want to place a placeholder, use the placeholder attribute
[02:54:48] <Voyage> thats the html made by some one else
[02:54:53] <brunoais> trust that the browser knows how the user wants that to work
[02:54:59] <brunoais> sigh...
[02:55:10] <beancurd> Voyage: oh shit sorry dude.
[02:55:11] <beancurd>  $(".text-cont input").eq(4).val();
[02:55:14] <beancurd> use that one :D
[02:55:18] <brunoais> and you are left with this piece of s**** right?
[02:55:19] <d0de> brunoais, any idea how I could work around it? I guess I could host something on the same domain that scrapes the feed and passes it to jquery from the same domain? Any idea how I'd get started learning how to do that?
[02:55:32] <brunoais> d0de, are you hosting the feed?
[02:55:39] <d0de> brunoais, no
[02:56:02] <brunoais> d0de, then you need to make a "proxy" of some kind in your server that redirects the request towards that feed
[02:56:13] <brunoais> they do not allow AJAX requests form other domains
[02:56:25] <brunoais> *from
[02:56:35] <Voyage> works.
[02:56:43] <Voyage> how can i get the xpath of this ?
[02:56:48] <beancurd> Voyage: haha.
[02:56:57] <beancurd> you using phantom / casper?
[02:57:02] <Voyage> phantom
[02:57:13] <brunoais> why do you need the XPath?
[02:57:21] <Voyage> to make an input
[02:57:27] <brunoais> Hum...
[02:57:38] <brunoais> there's a firefox extension that does that
[02:57:38] <beancurd> brunoais: phantomjs takes xpath selectors. or css3 i think.
[02:57:52] <brunoais> I think it's weird that it does not take a CSS selector
[02:57:54] <Voyage> I did that. but that gives me incorrect xpthat
[02:58:06] <brunoais> When I think XPath I only think of XML
[02:58:21] <brunoais> Voyage, are those pages made using XML and a schema?
[02:58:35] <beancurd> Voyage: my xpath isn't up to scratch, but iirc you should be able to use css3 nthchild selectors to grab it.
[02:58:38] <Voyage> this is not the correct xpath of the input membership fiield. /html/body/div/div/div[2]/div[2]/div/div/div[2]/div/div/div/div/div/div[2]/div/div/div/div/form/table/tbody/tr/td/div/div[2]/input
[02:58:56] <beancurd> shiiitttt.
[02:58:58] <brunoais> Is that a maze?
[02:59:01] <beancurd> haha.
[02:59:11] <beancurd> Voyage: use css selectors instead.
[02:59:16] <brunoais> try being less strict there
[02:59:20] <beancurd> also, use casperjs, it'll make your life easier.
[02:59:36] <brunoais> beancurd, is that a good thing or just more bloat?
[02:59:57] <beancurd> brunoais: casper? it's a good thing. because it'll make the automation easier to maintain.
[03:00:25] <beancurd> http://casperjs.org/
[03:00:33] <brunoais> yeah... I'm reading
[03:00:42] <brunoais> seems like it's meant to debug phantomjs
[03:01:23] <brunoais> beancurd, oh wait, casper is meant to test phantomjs that is meant to test other js libs?
[03:01:55] <brunoais> beancurd, is that it?
[03:02:06] <beancurd> brunoais: nope, casper is meant to drive phantomjs and make the experience more enjoyable. so you don't have to be as explicit with instructions.
[03:02:21] <brunoais> -_-
[03:02:26] <brunoais> more bloat, it seems
[03:02:36] <brunoais> what is phantomjs used for?
[03:02:40] <beancurd> wtf.
[03:02:40] <Voyage> the real login field is inside <div id="loginbox" ?
[03:02:42] <brunoais> they are not very much to the point
[03:02:54] <brunoais> Voyage, I dunno. Is it?
[03:03:27] <beancurd> brunoais: phantomjs is for headless testing primarily, nodejs module.
[03:03:41] <brunoais> Ah!
[03:03:53] <brunoais> so it is a nodejs server!
[03:03:56] <brunoais> Now I see...
[03:04:09] <beancurd> and casper builds upon phantom to add more methods to make automation and navigation easier.
[03:04:14] <Voyage> beancurd,   $(".text-cont input").eq(4).val();   means that get the 4th child of  .text-cont        or get the    fourth .text-cont element ?
[03:04:44] <Cork> Voyage: you get the fifth input element
[03:04:57] <Cork> eq is zero based
[03:04:58] <brunoais> ok so this is server-side js...
[03:05:04] <Voyage> ok.
[03:05:10] <beancurd> Voyage: break it down, ".text-cont input" returns 5 things... .eq(4) gets you the 5th one.
[03:05:17] <Voyage> beancurd,   $(".text-cont input").eq(4).val();   means that get the 5th child of  .text-cont        or get the    5th .text-cont element ?
[03:05:30] <beancurd> the 5th one.
[03:05:34] <beancurd> the latter.
[03:05:40] <beancurd> brunoais: yes.
[03:05:41] <Cork> Voyage: eq gets you the fifth element in the result array
[03:05:54] <Voyage> beancurd,  so the 5th .text-cont input
[03:06:06] <Cork> Voyage: $(".text-cont input").eq(4) is the same as  $($(".text-cont input")[4])
[03:06:18] <Voyage> thanks
[03:06:26] <beancurd> yep. try it without the .eq() and see.
[03:06:52] <beancurd> also, look into casperjs, you can just do casper.fill("#myform");
[03:07:03] <beancurd> instead of messing around with selectors and crap.
[03:13:13] <beancurd> i hope we didn't just help that voyage guy write some sort of airline account bruteforcing thing...
[03:13:45] <beancurd> wonder what the legal ramifications of that would be...
[03:13:56] <beancurd> Cork: we're in this together bro.
[03:14:33] <Voyage> beancurd,  bruteforce was ok 10 years ago. now we have captpha and servside blocking
[03:15:11] <Voyage> beancurd,  how did you counted the .text-cont occurance ?
[03:15:15] <Voyage> you use any tool?
[03:15:58] <beancurd> Voyage: i just did $(".text-cont input") look at the output array, and eyeball it.
[03:16:27] <beancurd> i suppose you could programatically find the right one by looping through them and matching a certain criteria.
[03:16:33] <beancurd> or just me more specific in your selector.
[03:16:47] <beancurd> thing is, html on that page is invalid, so.. it's a bit of a crap shoot
[03:17:07] <Voyage> beancurd,  how did you iterated the array values/
[03:17:20] <beancurd> each() should work.
[03:17:22] * Voyage just needs the xpath
[03:18:11] <beancurd> oh, read up on xpath, i'm not that familiar with that :/
[03:18:26] <Cork> Voyage: you never need xpath (more or less)
[03:18:51] <Cork> modern css selectors can do everything xpath can
[03:18:53] <beancurd> Cork: actually, at my old workplace we used some really shitty middleware that used xpath, and only xpath.
[03:18:54] <Cork> but much much faster
[03:19:00] <beancurd> it was very sad.
[03:19:12] <Cork> beancurd: well if it was old it is understandable
[03:19:23] <ortund> not sure if its a php issue or an issue with my POST, but my email form isn't sending all the form values to my php handler... http://stackoverflow.com/questions/23867801/phpmailer-email-sending-but-no-values-from-the-form
[03:19:25] <Cork> xpath was a mush a bit back
[03:19:29] <beancurd> the workplace was old. the middleware wasn't
[03:19:42] <Cork> beancurd: ouch
[03:19:57] <beancurd> so i quit.
[03:20:04] <Cork> ya, it is sad to see new code using xpath
[03:20:05] <Voyage> Cork,  hm. what would be css selector for that
[03:20:14] <Cork> Voyage: for what
[03:20:18] <Cork> didn't see your question
[03:20:23] <Voyage> alert ( $(".text-cont input").eq(4).val()  ) ;
[03:21:01] <Cork> Voyage: that is pretty much a css selector
[03:21:05] <Voyage> I opened firebug in firefox. there are only total 4 .text-cont (including hiddens).  but I can reach the 5th one also. strange
[03:21:27] <Cork> Voyage: do you have a link to the html structure?
[03:21:42] <Cork> cause i don't know if you need eq(4) or if a pure css one works
[03:21:47] <Voyage> sure
[03:21:48] <Voyage> https://www.cathaypacific.com/cx/en_HK/book-a-trip/redeem-flights/asia-miles-flight-award-redemption.html
[03:26:05] <Voyage> Cork,  beancurd  I dont understand that where is a$(".text-cont input").eq(6).val()       in the dom?
[03:26:33] <Cork> Voyage: it is the hidden input field
[03:26:42] <Cork> Voyage: what is it you want to target here?
[03:26:48] <Cork> the "PIN" field?
[03:26:52] <Voyage> yes
[03:27:07] <Voyage> but still, .text-cont [6] should exist
[03:27:09] <Voyage> right?
[03:27:26] <Cork> $('#standalone-login ._hintPw.hint') should do it
[03:27:46] <Voyage> ya but just understanding.
[03:27:54] <Voyage>  .text-cont [6] should exist
[03:27:55] <Cork> ogg nasty
[03:27:56] <Voyage> right?
[03:28:17] <Cork> it hids the "PIN" element and puts focus in the following element on keypress...
[03:28:43] <Cork> ah no not keypress
[03:28:44] <Cork> focus
[03:30:01] <Cork> Voyage: $("#standalone-login ._hintPw.hint").focus();$("#standalone-login ._hintPw.hint+input").val("hello")
[03:30:05] <Cork> that should work
[03:30:34] <Voyage> what the website did is nasty coding. no?
[03:30:45] <Voyage> alert( $('#standalone-login ._hintPw.hint').val()  ) ; gives me "PIN"
[03:30:54] <Cork> ya
[03:30:59] <Cork> cause it is the HINT element
[03:31:07] <Cork> when you focus that input field
[03:31:18] <Cork> it moves focus to the hidden input field following it
[03:31:29] <Cork> and hides the one you focused
[03:31:53] <ortund> Pretty glad I don't rely solely on IRC to solve my problems... I'd be screwed
[03:32:55] <Cork> ortund: asking in one community to come to another one to answer a question is kinda asking to be ignored
[03:33:12] <Voyage> Cork,  ok. which is the REAL input field in which the input goes. (I just want to put input and login. both for user id and pin )
[03:33:28] <Cork> Voyage: $("#standalone-login ._hintPw.hint+input").val("hello")
[03:33:33] <Voyage> Cork,  cnan I do directly that?
[03:33:37] <Cork> Voyage: but you need to trigger a focus on the first element
[03:33:43] <Cork> not sure if the code will work if you don't
[03:34:07] <Cork> Voyage: do these two things $("#standalone-login ._hintPw.hint").focus(); $("#standalone-login ._hintPw.hint+input").val("hello")
[03:34:14] <Voyage> Cork,  if all the relavent fields exists. (no matter hidden), I can send keys to them or set their values. correct ?
[03:34:16] <Cork> and it should work
[03:34:33] <Cork> Voyage: yes, but as the site depends on js to do things
[03:34:40] <Cork> you should trigger the events it expect
[03:34:46] <Cork> or you might have problem getting it to work
[03:35:10] <Voyage> one thing to confirm? the hidden fields do exist even when the focus() is not done?
[03:35:20] <Cork> sure
[03:35:34] <Cork> but the script might be in the wrong state
[03:35:35] <Voyage> then we can directly set the value of the REAL hidden field. cant we?
[03:35:43] <Cork> possible
[03:35:48] <Voyage> ok
[03:35:55] <Cork> unless the script ends up in an invalid state if you do it in the wrong order
[03:36:35] <Cork> and that wouldn't surprise me at all based on how hacky things are built
[03:36:58] <fattest> how do i make my image slider not affect all images on the page? http://jsfiddle.net/xjQv6/1/ ?
[03:37:03] <Voyage> now in context the the reals.  alert ( $(".text-cont input").eq(4).val()  ) ;
[03:37:08] <Voyage> alert ( $(".text-cont input").eq(6).val()  ) ;          give me the correct value for user id and pin.     now my questions are:  there are only 5 .text-cont elements . where did 6 came from.
[03:37:26] <Cork> Voyage: uh... what are you back at that selector...
[03:37:39] <Cork> use one that you know what it matches
[03:37:44] <Cork> .eq() is a bad idea
[03:37:52] <Cork> if they add any fields to the page your code will break
[03:37:55] <Voyage> iam just doing it for understanding
[03:38:03] <Voyage> ya sure but
[03:38:19] <Voyage> i asked becuase i am amazed that where is [6] ?
[03:38:39] <Cork> Voyage: there is seven input elements on the page
[03:39:01] <Voyage> where is the seventh? I am at firebug and can see only 5
[03:39:21] <Cork> Voyage: the password field is two elements
[03:39:24] <Cork> like i said before
[03:39:39] <Voyage> oh
[03:39:50] <Cork> one for show
[03:39:55] <Cork> and one that is the real one
[03:46:11] <Voyage> hm
[03:46:58] <jop008> anayone knows a good programming editor web based?
[03:47:45] <beancurd> jop008: i've heard good things about cloud9
[03:48:01] <Cork> jop008: there is one that github has made you might be ok with
[03:48:16] <Cork> https://github.com/atom
[03:48:48] <Cork> heavily inspired by sublime text
[03:48:49] <jop008> thx
[03:48:58] <beancurd> Cork: atom is web based?
[03:49:11] <Cork> beancurd: as far as i know ya
[03:49:42] <Cork> hmm
[03:49:58] <beancurd> nah, i think it's webkit based perhaps, but not hosted on the internets.
[03:49:59] <Cork> might be it only works as chrome extension...
[03:50:03] <Cork> ya
[03:50:19] <beancurd> webbased would be sweet, combined with github.
[03:50:23] <Cork> i know it exist as an extension for chrome (and that is basically all it is what ever version you get)
[03:51:03] <Cork> http://ace.c9.io/ ?
[03:51:04] <Cork> :)
[03:51:06] <jop008> looks promising maybe I can incorporate it with ezbuild.touchingservices.nl
[03:59:02] <Voyage> how can I print the value of an element by jquery in console?
[03:59:19] <Cork> Voyage: value as in what is entered=
[03:59:21] <Cork> *?
[03:59:23] <Voyage> console.log is obvious?
[03:59:31] <Cork> console.log(elm.val())
[03:59:38] <Cork> if you mean an input element
[03:59:41] <Voyage> Cork,  I mean an input field
[03:59:45] <Voyage> yea
[04:00:20] <Voyage> oh sorry
[04:00:26] <Voyage> Cork,  wrong question. how to set the value
[04:00:38] <Cork> Voyage: basically the same command
[04:00:45] <Cork> elm.val("new value")
[04:01:00] <Cork> i gave you the code for that before...
[04:01:10] <Voyage> #("#elementId").val("sadf")
[04:01:20] <Voyage> $("#elementId").val("sadf")
[04:02:10] <Voyage> Cork,  SyntaxError: missing ; before statement
[04:02:11] <Voyage> 	
[04:02:11] <Voyage> $(".text-cont input").eq(4).val("abc")  ) ;
[04:02:24] <Cork> Voyage: check the code you just pasted
[04:02:31] <Cork> and think for a second :)
[04:02:39] <Cork> "what looks wrong with that line"
[04:02:44] <Voyage> am.. it has not event attached
[04:03:02] <Voyage> like .click etc
[04:03:11] <Voyage> ?
[04:03:27] <Cork> Voyage: and again use a selector that you know will most likely work
[04:03:36] <Cork> .eq() all input fields in the page is a BAD idea
[04:03:46] <Voyage> no ) was extra
[04:03:55] <Cork> the slightest change in the page will break the script
[04:03:55] <Voyage> ok
[04:04:02] <Voyage> hm
[04:13:09] <Amnesia> question, how would I be able to match the closest tr element that's got an id argument?
[04:14:04] <Cork> Amnesia: closest parent?
[04:14:24] <Cork> .closest('tr[id]') could do it
[04:14:29] <Cork> if it was a parent
[04:14:48] <Cork> if it isn't you need to show a pb of the structure
[04:17:05] <Amnesia> Cork: https://privatepaste.com/c1192939b2
[04:17:29] <Cork> Amnesia: and from where do you need to grab it?
[04:17:42] <Cork> the button?
[04:17:51] <Amnesia> yep
[04:18:00] <Amnesia> and I need to select the tr on row #w
[04:18:02] <Amnesia> 2*
[04:18:03] <Cork> that is going to be a bit messy
[04:18:38] <Cork> but... $(this).closest('table').find('tbody tr[id]').last()
[04:18:45] <Voyage> Cork,  what does ._hintPw.hint   means

[04:20:42] <Cork> Amnesia: developer.mozilla.org, opera has one
[04:20:46] <Cork> there is learn.jquery.com
[04:21:10] <Cork> http://www.tutorialspoint.com is ok as far as i know
[04:21:15] <Amnesia> hm, ok ty
[04:21:25] <Cork> ahhh...
[04:21:32] <Cork> opera has removed there tutorial :/
[04:21:37] <Cork> *sad face*...
[04:21:54] <Zelpa> Does anyone know how to save the last selected theme and load it when the page is loaded?
[04:22:04] <Amnesia> http://www.tutorialspoint.com/assembly_programming/index.htm falls under the "high level languages" lol
[04:22:19] <Cork> Amnesia: lol
[04:22:36] <Voyage> Cork,  whats the diff b/w    ".class.class2"   and ".class .class2"
[04:22:48] <Cork> Voyage: the first is two classes on the same element
[04:22:53] <seutje> Amnesia: dat stock photo...
[04:22:57] <Cork> Voyage: the second is one class as a child of the first one
[04:23:08] <Amnesia> seutje: stock photo?

[04:23:45] <Voyage> Cork,  thanks
[04:23:59] <Amnesia> Cork: me gusta:D
[04:24:16] <Zelpa> Is there a better way to do a theme system than how I'm doing it currently? http://pastebin.com/bLn1PV96
[04:25:18] <erming> a little shoutout for my little plugin i've been working on: http://erming.github.io/tabcomplete/, might come in handy for someone else too
[04:25:47] <Amnesia> Cork: Someone also linked me to devdocs.io today
[04:25:53] <Amnesia> You might like that one aswell
[04:26:02] <Cork> Amnesia: no need for one :)
[04:26:13] <Amnesia> you know everything by heart^^?
[04:26:31] <Cork> Amnesia: anyway i do want to say one thing STAY AWAY from w3schools
[04:26:44] <Cork> it is NOT a good place to start (or ever reference)
[04:26:48] <Amnesia> hm ok
[04:27:02] <seutje> haha, I forget I have a highlighter set for "w3schools"
[04:27:10] <Cork> heh
[04:27:34] <seutje> gotta be quick to intervene if somebody links to it!~
[04:27:44] <Amnesia> lol
[04:27:51] <Amnesia> why's it that bad?
[04:27:58] <Cork> ?g w3fools
[04:27:59] <b-ot> Cork: W3Fools – A W3Schools Intervention → http://www.w3fools.com/
[04:28:44] <Cork> Amnesia: it has a long long history of disinformation, ie centric development
[04:29:13] <Amnesia> awh;[
[04:29:21] <Cork> so ya you can normally detect when a new user has tried learning to develop from w3schools
[04:29:34] <Cork> just cause of all the confusion it causes for them
[04:29:42] <Cork> and the type of errors they get
[04:33:57] <Amnesia> heh
[04:35:14] <beancurd> Cork: remember said middleware? they linkend to w3schools as a xpath reference.
[04:35:16] <beancurd> haha.
[04:35:28] <Cork> yay...
[04:35:54] <beancurd> anyway, it's this piece of shit.
[04:35:56] <beancurd> http://www.networkautomation.com/
[04:35:59] <seutje> FINE! I'll remove the highlight, geez
[04:36:28] <Cork> lol
[04:37:12] <beancurd> wait it goes worse, it's actually that piece of shit.. wrapped in this thing.
[04:37:14] <beancurd> http://www.globalscape.com/mft/
[04:37:30] <beancurd> which is also a piece of shit.
[04:37:42] <beancurd> so the whole thing is like a shit truffle.
[04:37:58] <beancurd> except, instead of chocolate and ganache, it's shit all the way through.
[04:42:11] <Zelpa> Can anyone figure out why this isn't working? http://pastebin.com/3b2ngc0d
[04:42:27] <Zelpa> I'm pretty new to jquery so i probably did something really dumb
[04:42:51] <madalin> Zelpa: any errors in the console ?
[04:43:09] <Zelpa> ReferenceError: currentTheme is not defined
[04:43:18] <Zelpa> Even though I define it in the button?
[04:44:47] <madalin> Zelpa: maybe try defining it BEFORE the click event ?
[04:44:58] <Zelpa> Yup, trying that right now.
[04:47:33] <Zelpa> Still not working :/
[04:50:43] <Zelpa> madalin: Is it because I'm trying to asign a var to an already existing var?
[04:52:31] <madalin> Zelpa: please have a look at http://api.jquery.com/click/
[04:52:59] <madalin> oh, wait.
[04:53:08] <madalin> i'm sorry..
[04:54:38] <madalin> thats not how i would do it..
[04:54:51] <m3th0d> hey all
[04:55:02] <madalin> i'd probably set currentTheme directly in the click function of the swagbutton..
[04:55:51] <Zelpa> Swagbutton applies the currently selected theme
[04:56:02] <Zelpa> I want the other buttons to be able to set currentTheme
[04:59:58] <Zelpa> Any other ideas? I'm 99% sure it's because I'm trying to assign a var to an already existing var.
[05:00:49] <Cork> Zelpa: aide note document.getElementById('expandthemes') can just be $('#expandthemes')
[05:01:12] <Radditz> hello
[05:01:16] <Radditz> http://jsfiddle.net/5aRvF/118/ why does this traverse each twice?
[05:01:37] <madalin> Zelpa: so set it to null before reassigning ?
[05:01:47] <Cork> Zelpa: secondly var currentTheme = "<theme>"; in the click handlers won't work as it only creates a local variable
[05:02:12] <Zelpa> Does jquery have public vars? I'm pretty new to it
[05:02:24] <madalin> Radditz: unclosed <a> tag.
[05:02:44] <Radditz> madalin: it's self closed?
[05:03:03] <madalin> Radditz: and incorrect code. The <a is like this: <a href="linkhere">linkname</a>
[05:03:23] <madalin> Radditz: take a look at http://jsfiddle.net/5aRvF/120/
[05:03:24] <Radditz> madalin: I see, I didn't know a can't be self-closed, thank you
[05:04:18] <Zelpa> Cork: How will I set current theme then?
[05:04:32] <Cork> Zelpa: http://pastebin.com/MhX4FGN3
[05:04:41] <Cork> it can be simplified a lot more though
[05:04:53] <Cork> Zelpa: also you should move the theme css into a css file
[05:04:56] <Cork> and use classes instead
[05:05:29] <slax0r> swagtheme? o.O
[05:05:48] <Cork> actually hmm you have other errors here
[05:06:04] <Zelpa> I have my actual CSS in stylesheet.css
[05:06:10] <Cork> Zelpa: http://pastebin.com/pceAS3i0
[05:06:16] <madalin> you're welcome Radditz
[05:06:36] <Cork> Zelpa: then move the extra theme info in there too
[05:06:37] <Zelpa> You're a legend Cork
[05:06:46] <Cork> Zelpa: and control it from classes on body
[05:06:49] <Zelpa> What did you change to get that to work?
[05:06:52] <Cork> then you don't need any css in your js
[05:07:09] <Cork> Zelpa: fixed the variable to not be local for the click handlers
[05:07:21] <Cork> and changed it from a string to the actually selected object
[05:07:39] <Cork> but ya, this could be improved quite a bit
[05:07:58] <Zelpa> This is actually my first Jquery thing ever, and my first Javascript
[05:08:16] <Zelpa> So yeah it probably can be cleaned up a ton
[05:08:42] <Cork> Zelpa: biggest part is to get the theme control out of js
[05:08:50] <Zelpa> So how do I do that?
[05:08:54] <Cork> the rest can be optimized, but it is lesser of a probelm
[05:09:04] <Zelpa> Could I make external theme files like lighttheme.css?
[05:09:13] <Cork> Zelpa: do the styling based on a class on ex. body
[05:09:26] <Cork> body.darkTheme p { color:... }
[05:10:14] <Zelpa> But how would I change that from the jquery?
[05:10:58] <Cork> $('body').removeClass('darkTheme lightTheme some-otherTheme').addClass('your-selected-theme')
[05:11:17] <Cork> removeClass should list all possible themes
[05:11:23] <Cork> and addClass should add the selected one
[05:11:40] <Zelpa> Maybe I'm an idiot but I still have no clue what you're talking about
[05:11:46] <Cork> heh
[05:11:51] <Cork> ok i'll try making a small example
[05:12:18] <uskerine> hi, could someone please help me to get this Jquery AJAX call working? I would liek to send via HTML POST the id field, and receive a JSON object. How should I write the AJA JQuery method? thanks a lot
[05:12:19] <uskerine> http://pastebin.com/vrJVr9WZ
[05:12:58] <uskerine> by id i mean data-id field
[05:17:35] <Cork> Zelpa: http://jsfiddle.net/uMW2q/
[05:17:41] <Cork> really simple example
[05:17:52] <Cork> but it should show you the general idea
[05:18:35] <Cork> uskerine: your sending params not json
[05:19:03] <Zelpa> So you moved the themes into the CSS?
[05:19:14] <Cork> Zelpa: yes
[05:19:30] <Cork> and the data into html
[05:19:37] <Zelpa> What are the advantages?
[05:19:37] <Cork> so js is just flow and actions
[05:19:47] <Cork> Zelpa: separation of code
[05:19:55] <Cork> easier to manage
[05:20:08] <Zelpa> I was originally planning on not even writing anything in the HTML
[05:20:17] <Cork> and you don't need to add more code to handle more themes
[05:20:21] <Zelpa> I know it's possible to create elements using JQuery
[05:20:40] <Zelpa> So I was thinking of just adding something like a theme, and it would automatically add it to the theme list
[05:21:05] <Zelpa> That way you would only need to edit 1 file to add another theme.
[05:21:11] <Cork> Zelpa: well you can have your html as strings in js
[05:21:19] <Cork> but... it doesn't really belong there
[05:21:57] <uskerine> i want to send param
[05:22:00] <uskerine> and receive JSON
[05:22:03] <Zelpa> So with your script you don't need to manually add the click events for buttons
[05:22:08] <uskerine> so i will pick up param as HTML POST field
[05:22:12] <uskerine> and i will return JSON
[05:22:19] <Cork> uskerine: then your code should work
[05:22:29] <uskerine> how do i receive JSON?
[05:22:33] <Cork> Zelpa: you do it is the second line
[05:22:39] <Cork> uskerine: in the success callback
[05:22:45] <Cork> or .done if you use deferred
[05:23:02] <Cork> Zelpa: but i add one line to the parent of the buttons
[05:23:07] <Cork> and it handles all the buttons
[05:23:33] <Zelpa> How are you doing that by the way?
[05:23:48] <Cork> Zelpa: its calld event delegation
[05:23:55] <Cork> Zelpa: i bind a handler on #themes
[05:24:10] <Cork> and tell it to listen for events bubbling up from elements matching the selector 'button'
[05:24:19] <Cork> so one events for all the buttons
[05:24:27] <Cork> *one event for
[05:24:35] <Zelpa> What's the body.removeClass for
[05:24:49] <Cork> Zelpa: to let you switch theme
[05:24:57] <Cork> else you would just add class after class
[05:25:02] <Cork> that one removes all the classes
[05:25:07] <Cork> and adds the one from the clicked button
[05:25:30] <Zelpa> So
[05:25:38] <Zelpa> You find all the buttons within themes
[05:25:55] <Zelpa> find their name, and then what?
[05:25:59] <Zelpa> How does that relate to the CSS?
[05:26:07] <Cork> if you check the html section
[05:26:10] <Cork> you have data-theme
[05:26:23] <Cork> that string correlates to the class in the css section
[05:26:35] <Zelpa> What part of the JS does that?
[05:26:49] <Cork> uh does what?
[05:27:03] <Cork> js just sets and removes classes on body
[05:27:10] <Cork> nothing else
[05:27:20] <Cork> the styling is done by the browser
[05:27:32] <Cork> the data is stored on the button
[05:28:07] <Zelpa> So is data-theme a normal CSS thing?
[05:28:11] <Zelpa> I've never seen that before
[05:28:19] <Cork> its a normal html attribute
[05:28:28] <Cork> or rather data- is a namespace for extra data
[05:28:44] <Cork> Zelpa: js grabs that string as $(this).data('theme')
[05:28:52] <Cork> and sets it as a class on body
[05:29:58] <brunoais> Cork, I'd use different <link> tags for each theme, instead
[05:30:19] <brunoais> wouldn't that be a cleaner way?
[05:30:19] <Cork> brunoais: it adds much much grater overhead
[05:30:24] <brunoais> really?
[05:30:28] <brunoais> Hum...
[05:30:39] <brunoais> I've been making that and I didn't notice
[05:30:44] <Cork> it adds load times as the separate css file would have to be fetched
[05:31:08] <Cork> it adds memory as the browser would have to parse and keep the compiled css rules for that css resource
[05:31:18] <brunoais> Hum... I don't notice that...
[05:31:21] <Zelpa> I still don't understand what the removeclass part does.
[05:31:25] <Cork> if he had a lot of css rules sure it would make sence
[05:31:27] <Cork> sense
[05:31:30] <brunoais> maybe it's just my browser that optimizes it
[05:31:37] <Cork> but we talk about 3-4 css rules here
[05:31:41] <Zelpa> So you find all the buttons within the themes div
[05:31:46] <brunoais> ok
[05:31:52] <Cork> Zelpa: without remove you would get
[05:31:57] <brunoais> I thought the 4 rules were just an example
[05:31:57] <Cork> <body class="">
[05:32:00] <Cork> <body class="red">
[05:32:06] <Cork> <body class="red green">
[05:32:09] <Cork> <body class="red green blue">
[05:32:18] <Cork> and then no possible way to switch theme
[05:32:28] <Cork> removeClass removes the classes so you can pick a new one
[05:32:58] <seutje> class is probably not the most useful attribute for that
[05:33:08] <Zelpa> Can you run me through it again?
[05:33:12] <Cork> brunoais: you would have to have quite a long list of styling rules for it to be interesting to split it up into a separate file
[05:33:13] <Zelpa> I'm still not getting how this works
[05:33:15] <brunoais> I don't remember much details but IIRC, when I did the tests, the browser was defering the download of the disabled and alternative <link> to after all other resources were loaded
[05:33:30] <brunoais> but ok. I get the picture
[05:33:55] <Cork> brunoais: ah, disabled isn't supported in all browsers
[05:34:03] <Cork> (dynamically changing that is)
[05:34:27] <brunoais> so the attribute is supported, right? Just the js to disable isn't
[05:34:29] <Cork> Zelpa: addClass takes the current string of classes in the class attribute
[05:34:43] <Cork> Zelpa: and adds the one you give it to the list if it isn't already there
[05:34:54] <Cork> Zelpa: removeClass does the opposite
[05:35:15] <Cork> brunoais: except it doesn't take effect if you change it after load
[05:35:22] <Zelpa> $('#themes').on('click', 'button', function() {
[05:35:24] <Cork> (in some browsers)
[05:35:30] <Zelpa> That part is for the button that you press
[05:35:34] <Cork> yes
[05:35:38] <Zelpa> and it removes the classes for the other ones correct?
[05:35:44] <Cork> no
[05:35:50] <Cork> that is just a click handler
[05:35:54] <Zelpa> Yeah
[05:36:00] <Zelpa> BUt the removeclass part removes them
[05:36:08] * brunoais researching...
[05:36:24] <Cork> Zelpa: .removeClass(themes) removes all known classes from body
[05:36:38] <Cork> .addClass($(this).data('theme')) adds the class from the button you click
[05:36:38] <Zelpa> And then addclass adds the one from the button you selected?
[05:37:40] <Zelpa> I still don't understand how this does anything to the CSS
[05:37:51] <Cork> Zelpa: the css selectors
[05:37:57] <Cork> the browser does the rest for you
[05:38:39] <Cork> brunoais: ugg, sorry
[05:38:42] <Cork> i mixed it up
[05:38:44] <Zelpa> Thanks for the help, I gotta go now.
[05:38:55] <brunoais> np
[05:38:58] <Cork> brunoais: it was mutation observers not firing
[05:39:02] <uskerine> this is quite basic, but better ask than sorry... in the success function, should I give any argument to have access to the returned JSON object?
[05:39:03] <Cork> https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=912754
[05:39:21] * brunoais reading
[05:39:23] <uskerine> so, in JQuery, how do you have access to the response JSON object
[05:39:58] <Cork> uskerine: $.ajax().done(function(data) { data.somethingJSONY })
[05:40:21] <Cork> and no you can't return the json data from the function
[05:41:05] <brunoais> Cork, k'ay. the js to disable is part of the spec. the attribute disabled is not
[05:41:22] <brunoais> but using the rel "alternative" does what is actually expected
[05:41:32] * Cork nods
[05:41:32] <Jattenalle> Cork, hah, i actually ran into something like that just a few hours ago, needed to return a value from a nested function.. after being silly about it, i just rewrote the code a bit to make more sense :P
[05:41:58] <Cork> Jattenalle: you can return from a nested function
[05:42:07] <Cork> Jattenalle: you can't return from an async callback though
[05:42:14] <Jattenalle> that's what i meant, sorry
[05:42:21] <uskerine> http://pastebin.com/DPNKSN7R
[05:42:23] <uskerine> like this?
[05:42:34] <Cork> uskerine: sure
[05:42:35] <uskerine> should the alert show the JSON object (I am positive it is being sent, as I checked with firebug)
[05:42:41] <Cork> though toString won't really work
[05:42:56] <Cork> JSON.stringify(data)
[05:43:12] <uskerine> stringify? :-)
[05:43:20] <Cork> ya
[05:43:21] <Cork> i know
[05:43:31] <Cork> blame the creator of json2.js
[05:43:43] <uskerine> I wouldn't make any comment
[05:43:48] <uskerine> :)
[05:45:42] <Zelpa> Cork: The second I turned my computer off I figured out how it worked lol
[05:46:02] <Cork> ^^
[05:46:25] <uskerine> thanks a lot Cork, now I see the JSON info and object, so I can start jsonizing things
[05:47:46] <Zelpa> So from what I understand, you find all the buttons within themes, and when you click on one it removed all the other classes, and then adds the class the one you pressed to the body correct?
[05:47:46] <brunoais> I just tested the alternative <link> with one default
[05:48:07] <brunoais> I tested in firefox. I'm going to test in chrome and in IE after
[05:48:12] <uskerine> now.., is there any shortcut in JQuery  to automatically load form input fields from a JSON object?
[05:48:36] <brunoais> but the console shows that firefox postpones the download of the alternate stylesheets to after the page loads.
[05:48:57] <Cork> Zelpa: correct
[05:49:24] <Cork> uskerine: FROM json
[05:49:27] <Cork> no not really
[05:49:52] <Zelpa> The main thing I didn't understand was the theme tag, but now I understand. If you add it to a div, and name it something like red, in the CSS you could do div.red { CSS crap }
[05:50:22] <Cork> exactly
[05:50:41] <Cork> Zelpa: and it is just a random attribute name
[05:50:41] <Zelpa> Could you send me that jsfiddle again?
[05:50:58] * Cork diggs through scrollback
[05:51:17] <Cork> Zelpa: http://jsfiddle.net/uMW2q/
[05:51:54] <Zelpa> Thanks a lot cork, I'll probably be on here tomorrow asking for more help lol.
[05:52:04] <Cork> :)
[05:53:21] <uskerine> ??
[05:53:24] <uskerine> not following you Cork
[05:54:02] <Cork> uskerine: no there isn't any helpers for creating elements from json
[05:55:00] <uskerine> ok, but i mean, to load values into existing input fields of a form
[05:55:02] <slax0r> isn't json basically a js object?
[05:55:17] <Cork> slax0r: it is
[05:55:18] <uskerine> like i have <input id= or name="data1" and you load that with data1 JSON field
[05:55:58] <slax0r> so then <form field.val()? = jsonSlashJSObject.key would set the form fields value to the json value of the given key
[05:56:02] <Cork> uskerine: so do something like $('input[name="' + json[x].name + '"]).val(json[x].value);
[05:56:03] <Cork> or similar
[05:56:17] <uskerine> great
[05:56:29] <uskerine> thanks i will try that, i am new to JQuery and JSON, that helps
[05:56:53] <Cork> i missed a closing string marker there
[05:57:00] <Cork> $('input[name="' + json[x].name + '"]').val(json[x].value);
[05:57:18] <uskerine> what does json[x] mean?
[05:57:34] <Cork> uskerine: an array of elements in the json
[05:57:41] <Cork> but how you structure the json is up to you
[05:57:50] <uskerine> understood
[05:57:56] <uskerine> thanks, i will give it a try, it seems easy

[06:05:49] <brunoais> IE9 places the alt in least priority
[06:05:49] <brunoais> IE8 & chrome downloads in the same order
[06:05:51] <brunoais> Cork, ^
[06:05:56] <brunoais> my findings in a quick test
[06:06:12] <brunoais> I may be wrong but the test seems solid
[06:06:15] <Cork> brunoais: ya, my comment was based on the bug i linked
[06:06:25] <Cork> it has nothing to do with the actual style change
[06:06:34] <brunoais> hum...
[06:06:35] <brunoais> ok
[06:06:43] <Cork> but ya, the load and memory overhead is still true
[06:06:50] <Cork> though it should normally not matter much
[06:06:57] <brunoais> the browser should be able to manage those
[06:07:21] <Cork> brunoais: css rules takes up much more memory then you think
[06:07:30] <brunoais> It's not in the hands of the web programmer (for web pages) to be concerned with the multitude of situations possible
[06:07:55] <Cork> brunoais: well the web developer should still think about what causes memory usage
[06:07:58] <brunoais> it's the browser's job to keep itself from downloading the alts if no memory
[06:08:07] <brunoais> yeah, true
[06:08:18] <brunoais> but I only do that for js when I'm dealing with serious business
[06:08:23] <Cork> brunoais: the one developing the site is the one that can do those jugement calls
[06:08:28] <Cork> the browser can only guess and hope
[06:08:40] <brunoais> jQuery alone is the thing that uses more memory in the stuff I do (excuding images)
[06:08:48] <Cork> brunoais: mostely ya
[06:09:04] <Cork> but when there is simple rules you can hold in mind to keep things slim
[06:09:05] <brunoais> when I don't use jQuery... it's the CSS
[06:09:12] <brunoais> yep
[06:09:13] <Cork> and if that makes the code easier to manage
[06:09:16] <Cork> no reason not to do it :)
[06:09:21] <brunoais> :)
[06:09:31] <brunoais> I don't use jQuery much, for starters :D
[06:09:42] <brunoais> makes me feel like the page durps a bit
[06:09:47] <brunoais> I like 'em fast
[06:09:55] <brunoais> not "look fast", actual fast!
[06:10:10] <Cork> heh
[06:10:17] <Cork> depends on what part of jquery you use
[06:10:25] <Cork> it is normally very fast
[06:10:44] <Cork> but ya js has come to a point now where jquery isn't really needed anymore
[06:11:04] <Cork> jquery was a life saver back with ie5.5 was a thing
[06:11:17] <Cork> you cried blood if you didn't have it :)
[06:12:40] <brunoais> true
[06:12:45] <brunoais> really true
[06:13:07] <brunoais> I still use jQuery but only for the stuff that really needs it
[06:14:00] <Cork> brunoais: well i use it heavily for websites i develop
[06:14:04] <brunoais> When I stumble upon a jQuery plugin, I usually easilly port it to DOM code.
[06:14:09] <brunoais> I belive :)
[06:14:19] <Cork> but wouldn't ever cross my mind to use it for ex. extensions or user scripts
[06:14:20] <brunoais> I'm also in this channel to get some more grip on jQuery
[06:14:59] <Cork> but ya jquery could be slimmed down to .find, .closest .on .off and $.ajax
[06:15:06] <Cork> and i would be fine :)
[06:15:18] <Cork> cause those are really handy to have
[06:16:03] <brunoais> $.ajax... I deal just fine with direct XMLHttpRequest() :D and then I use addEventListener for the multiple steps I'm interested in
[06:16:18] <brunoais> .find -> querySelectorAll()
[06:16:34] <Cork> brunoais: for the simple forms ya
[06:16:37] <brunoais> .closest() -> (ok, that makes sense... but I don't use such)
[06:16:43] <Cork> but when you have selections.find()
[06:16:51] <Cork> it isn't fun getting that to work with querySelectorAll
[06:16:59] <brunoais> depends on the POV
[06:17:02] <brunoais> but I accept that
[06:17:14] <xec> what i hate about qsa is that it doesn't have array methods like forEach :(
[06:17:24] <Cork> brunoais: also if you have a group of ppl that also need to work with the site
[06:17:34] <brunoais> .on() .off() -> Sometimes, rarely, I feel I could gain something with the delegation. But I do just fine without them
[06:17:44] <brunoais> Oh right...
[06:17:44] <Cork> brunoais: that don't know much js (more then "it looks like...)
[06:17:45] <beancurd> i would prefer more concise legible code at the expense of performance.
[06:17:54] <Cork> then jquery makes life a heck a lot easier
[06:18:06] <drej> jquery makes me breakfast in the mornings
[06:18:07] <brunoais> easier... yeah, maybe/probably
[06:18:19] <brunoais> but I see loads of ppl abusing it
[06:18:31] <brunoais> you sound more like someone that uses it
[06:18:31] <Cork> brunoais: ya, it is for the delegation features in on off that it is nice
[06:18:44] <brunoais> I use .contains() for delegation
[06:18:45] <Cork> addEventListener works fine for normal handlers
[06:18:49] <Voyage>  how to debug in firebug? I want to see whats happeneing and what JS methods are being called
[06:18:55] <Cork> brunoais: what?
[06:19:09] <Cork> Voyage: click the script tab
[06:19:27] <Cork> go to the line that you want to inspect and put a breakpoint there
[06:19:35] <brunoais> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Node.contains
[06:19:54] <Cork> brunoais: that isn't really delegation
[06:20:11] <brunoais> I use that to make sure it is a node I'm after
[06:20:23] <Cork> brunoais: but if you don't know what node you're after
[06:20:33] <Cork> cause when your function was assigned it didn't exist
[06:20:37] <brunoais> I also use this, when appropriate: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element.matches
[06:21:18] <Cork> brunoais: except that one is still prefixed
[06:21:19] <brunoais> Now that I think about it... I think the .on() is more on that last one than the contains...
[06:21:22] <Cork> so not fun to use
[06:21:30] <brunoais> polyfill FTW!!!
[06:21:43] <brunoais> it is stable enough for use
[06:21:46] <Cork> brunoais: and that is to a large degree what jquery on is
[06:21:46] <brunoais> so I use polyfill
[06:22:03] <brunoais> I... didn't read that part of jQuery's code yet
[06:22:32] <Cork> brunoais: my point of view is the lib is small enough
[06:22:45] <Cork> the code is fast enough
[06:22:49] <brunoais> I just find it challenging to use the browser API.
[06:22:52] <Cork> == why reinvent it
[06:22:56] <brunoais> I don't mind using jQuery
[06:23:08] <Voyage> Cork,  I want to see what happens when I press a submit button. every function called by the chain reaction
[06:23:08] <brunoais> because, as I reinvent it, I learn how it works and how it's made :D
[06:23:11] <Cork> brunoais: sure i do it a lot too, and i find it fun
[06:23:20] <Cork> brunoais: but website development isn't for fun for me :)
[06:23:33] <brunoais> I participate in open source for website dev
[06:23:41] <Cork> Voyage: doesn't exist
[06:23:53] <brunoais> I do it because my normal work is not challenging enough for me
[06:24:07] <brunoais> I also dev a closed source where I'm in charge of how code is made
[06:24:11] <brunoais> that makes it even more fun!
[06:27:15] <jaccob> you know the memoization function from Javascript Ninja book by John Resig, it doesn't seem to work: http://jsfiddle.net/wnKY5/
[06:29:00] <Voyage> Cork,  how to find a function if i know its name. there might be many includes of .js
[06:29:19] <Voyage> Cork,  I see a button that has onClick()= submitByDest();
[06:29:19] <brunoais> tp43_, I think it is a "this"... let me try...
[06:29:53] <Voyage> onClick="submitByDest(); return false;"
[06:31:38] <brunoais> tp43_, shouldn't it be more like this: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element.matches
[06:32:12] <brunoais> Voyage, for starters, you should not use events like that
[06:32:19] <brunoais> They are hell to debug when they fail
[06:32:43] <brunoais> to find the function, you may use the browser console
[06:32:44] <Voyage> brunoais,  its some one elses code.
[06:32:49] <seutje> tp43_: ur comparison seems off
[06:33:01] <seutje> http://jsfiddle.net/wnKY5/2/
[06:33:02] <brunoais> seutje, does my solution feel correct?
[06:33:09] <Voyage> brunoais,  and putting you js in other .js files is not a good thing?
[06:33:24] <brunoais> Voyage, what do you mean?
[06:33:35] <tp43_> Voyage, I think you can drop the on now, so just click, and you supposed to use addEventListener now too, so element.addEventListener("click", function(){...}, false);
[06:33:44] <tp43_> I wonder why there is always a false as last arg?
[06:33:52] <tp43_> what happens if you set it to true
[06:34:11] <decx> actually if you use addeventlistener you need a shim for old ie
[06:34:13] <seutje> brunoais: eh? not sure what Element.matches has to do with this
[06:34:31] <brunoais> seutje, not that, this: http://jsfiddle.net/wnKY5/1/
[06:35:12] <brunoais> tp43_, it's to get it during the bubble or capture stage
[06:35:15] <seutje> brunoais: if ur gonna use undefined, should probably use ===
[06:35:25] <seutje> also, it'll break if something tries to use the undefined key
[06:35:51] <brunoais> tp43_, the events first capture form the window element to the DOM element, then they then bubble up to the window element
[06:36:13] <brunoais> seutje, I assume that if it is undefined, it is not defined
[06:36:17] <seutje> oh wait, ur not using .data.undefined
[06:36:22] <seutje> nvm that last remark
[06:36:24] <brunoais> ok
[06:36:36] <tp43_> seutje, there is a decent shim for ie8, but not for less than that. Is there any usage for less than ie8 anymore though. Personally I don't even code for non-javascript users
[06:36:46] <seutje> but still, === or any falsy value will screw it over
[06:36:52] <brunoais> seutje, http://jsfiddle.net/wnKY5/3/ changed.
[06:36:55] <brunoais> you were right
[06:37:04] <brunoais> that way it is safer
[06:37:12] <tp43_> seutje, sorry, I meant decx
[06:37:46] <tp43_> decx, this shim right? https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget.addEventListener
[06:37:47] <decx> tp43_ <ie9 attachEvent, else on
[06:37:51] <decx> http://jsfiddle.net/decx/tKJC3/
[06:38:09] <brunoais> btw, just FYI, seutje , your solution does not work :). values default to undefined, not null
[06:38:39] <brunoais> tp43_, yeah. That's the one I use
[06:38:58] <tp43_> decx, yeah, that's what I said too
[06:39:44] <seutje> brunoais: oh yeah, I just flipped the operator, that's all I wanted to point out :P
[06:40:04] <seutje> brunoais: and without a strict equals, they're both falsy anyway
[06:40:17] <seutje> but yeah, then u can't really set null values efficiently
[06:41:00] <_biff> hi
[06:41:02] <_biff> is that the only way making a chat conversation that i should check periodically that check wheter a new message into the db is arrived..
[06:41:13] <_biff> e.g how does the facebook work
[06:41:17] <seutje> personally, I'd probably use a scoped variable so the getters/setters have to be used and the data isn't exposed entirely
[06:41:20] <tp43_> brunoais, yeah, bubble in and out, how does that affect us?
[06:41:51] <brunoais> tp43_, it's also the order
[06:42:11] <brunoais> with capture, you can give it more like a "top priority" to the event
[06:42:21] <brunoais> I don't use it much but, sometimes, I actually use it
[06:42:37] <brunoais> there are use-cases where it is really useful
[06:42:55] <brunoais> I can't get you some because it's closed-source...
[06:43:08] <brunoais> you'd need too much information for it to come up as actual useful
[06:43:35] <brunoais> BTW, if an event does not bubble, it captures, anyway
[06:43:43] <brunoais> (why it is called capture, beats me)
[06:43:58] <seutje> brunoais, tp43_: like this http://jsfiddle.net/wnKY5/4/
[06:43:58] <tp43_> how do close source client side code, make it cryptic and minified, or you talkin server js
[06:44:23] <seutje> but I guess u might want to explicitly expose the data
[06:45:25] <tp43_> seutje, sweet, var data = data || {}; is much better
[06:46:14] <seutje> well, it's kinda superfluous, that bit
[06:46:57] <tp43_> seutje, I like it better than, if(!this.data) this.data = {};
[06:47:08] <brunoais> seutje, yeah, that's another way of doing it
[06:48:07] <tp43_> every time you call the function, it is creating its own context but that isn't as I'd expect
[06:48:08] <seutje> actually, tp43_, remove that bit and just make it var data = {};
[06:48:13] <seutje> otherwise it could get hoisted
[06:48:36] <tp43_> seutje, yeah, but if you use var, then the  object get's clear everytime its called
[06:49:17] <seutje> it's  an IIFE though
[06:49:21] <seutje> it only gets called once
[06:49:45] <seutje> the variable declaration is outside the named function but inside the function expression
[06:49:58] <tp43_> it can easily be solved by do var Strg = function(){...} and var strg = new Strg();
[06:50:52] <tp43_> but I was just saying the way John Resig wrote it doesn't work which shocked me, but I guess he was just illustrating a point and figured in practice we would get the incidentally part working on our own.
[06:51:49] <seutje> why would you use it as a constructor?
[06:51:50] <tp43_> seutje, no, I mean, I call it twice explicity using it's name
[06:52:02] <seutje> it has no name
[06:52:58] <tp43_> seutje, cause then it create an object of its own self, otherwise when you call it twice on its own, it simply runs the function twice and you lose the object at the end of execution and starts from scratch the second time you call it.
[06:53:16] <seutje> (function(window) { var data = {}; var foo = function() {return data;}; window.foo = foo; })(this); <- data will only ever be defined once
[06:53:25] <seutje> there is no second time calling it
[06:53:44] <seutje> it got parsed, it returned, it got garbage collected
[06:54:02] <seutje> only way u can re-execture that is by reloading the file/code
[06:54:09] <tp43_> seutje, yeah, that probably works too, I was talking about the way I had originally
[06:55:12] <seutje> oh ok, just wanted to point out you can fully control the level of exposure
[06:55:32] <tp43_> seutje, yeah, its sweet, thx
[06:55:35] <seutje> like that last example, it'll return data, but since it's an object, it's by reference, so you can still fuck with it :P
[06:55:49] <koell> tp43_: thinkpad t43? <3
[06:56:16] <tp43_> koell, yeah but it broke on me, now I am on a desktop, I think it dell
[07:09:18] <lolmaus> When i do `$collection.each( function(index, htmlElement) {});`, for each iteration i have to do `var $currentItem = $(htmlElement);` so that i can work with it. I think this is a huge performance penalty. Is there a quick way to loop through jQuery objects directly, rather than their HTML elements?
[07:19:55] <Petazz> Hi! I'm getting a Cannot read property of undefined while trying to use $.fn.popover.Constructor.DEFAULTS
[07:20:32] <Petazz> Should popover be initialized beforehand or smthing?
[07:21:43] <beancurd> Petazz: make sure you have jquery before popover
[07:22:07] <Petazz> beancurd: Should popover be included separately?
[07:22:49] <beancurd> as opposed to?
[07:23:00] <decx> lolmaus just loop through it normally for (var i = 0, l = $collection.length; i < l; i++){ $collection.eq(i).text('whatever') }
[07:23:15] <uskerine> what is wrong with this JSON object definition? http://pastebin.com/9fQ4Y0Ve
[07:23:21] <uskerine> it says "expected : but found ,"
[07:23:30] <Petazz> beancurd: Just including bootstrap.js
[07:23:59] <lolmaus> decx: this is relatively easy with CoffeeScript, but is a nuisance with vanilla JS. I wonder why there's no `.forEach()`-like iterator for that.
[07:24:24] <uskerine> no, actually it says "Expected ',' instead of ':'"
[07:24:36] <decx> there is but for each is shit
[07:30:39] <Petazz> So using bootstrap-editable.js I'm getting that popover is not defined. Is it me or the library?
[07:30:52] <lolmaus> decx: your suggestion does not give any performance benefit. :( http://jsperf.com/jquery-for-eq-vs-each
[07:39:29] <decx> there's a bit if you cache the length
[07:40:02] <decx> if you care that much about performance maybe consider staying native in the loop
[07:46:23] <uskerine> hi, i am trying to populate automatically form fields from a JSON object, following Cork advice I have done this:
[07:46:23] <uskerine> http://pastebin.com/CVxCAYqp
[07:46:24] <lolmaus> decx: thx for the length suggestion. But the difference is still less than 20%.
[07:46:33] <uskerine> i think i am missing how to actually deal with JSON "data" object
[07:46:42] <uskerine> any guidance/help is welcomed
[07:47:42] <Cork> uskerine: make a jsfiddle with the code json and code
[07:47:53] <lolmaus> uskerine: try `data.name` instead of `data[0].name`.
[07:48:36] <uskerine> i don't think i can make a fiddle easily,as AJAX server service will not be available
[07:50:05] <uskerine> data.name shows nothing
[07:52:18] <decx> uskerine try http://www.json-generator.com for example json that you can access from fiddle
[07:52:23] <_blasty_> hi, Im trying to select all elements with a specific tag below another specific element. so im trying something like $("#someid > b") to get all <b> elements inside of #someid
[07:52:30] <_blasty_> but it only seems to return the first element found, not all of them
[07:54:17] <decx> this will only look for direct children of someid
[07:55:27] <_blasty_> decx: sure, but I have multiple direct children, and it only seem to return the first one
[07:55:38] <_blasty_> so Im probably missing some selector construct .. going through the manual atm
[07:55:47] <decx> show markup
[07:56:41] <_blasty_> <div id='someid'><b>a</b><b>b</b><b>c</b></div>, something like that
[07:57:50] <_blasty_> apparently there's children() which u can then chain to filter() as well, but it claims children() is not a valid method for the object returned by the $("#someid") selector function.. *puzzled*
[07:57:59] <chixuclub> quit
[07:58:08] <decx> doesnt make sense then
[07:58:15] <decx> something is is afoot
[07:58:20] <decx> else*
[07:58:30] <_blasty_> hmm.. I'll dive a bit deeper
[08:00:31] <lolmaus> Can you please upvote this question? No idea why it's being downvoted. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/23872678/
[08:02:49] <jakobhans> lolmaus, as the answers point out, I think it's because you're not using a basic feature of jQuery -> $(this)
[08:04:08] <lolmaus> jakobhans: `.each( function() { $(this) }` and `.each( function(i, e) { $(e) }` are absolutely identical both technically and performance-wise.
[08:05:05] <lolmaus> jakobhans: the only difference is that using argument always works, whereas `this` might be not available due to scope proxying or using `=>` in CoffeeScript.
[08:05:11] <jakobhans> lolmaus, yeah, I just read your reply to the only answer...
[08:07:14] <_blasty_> decx: ok that was super embarassing .. apparently all of jQuery was not included .. I think chrome console might have some minimal jquery-ish selector support which made me think it was there *G*
[08:07:18] <_blasty_> thanks
[08:08:43] <chixuclub> hi there, i'm trying to prevent form submission but i don't get why it work in a way and not another : http://pastebin.com/q9BxUTtj
[08:08:49] <decx> lol
[08:09:24] <decx> lolmaus you'll never get serious gains without going full native
[08:13:22] <lolmaus> decx: i could if internal representation of jQuery collections was array-like. Lack of solutions to my issue indicates that the representation is rather a single solid object and only underlying HTML elements are arrayified.
[08:14:40] <alistair> hey, just made an on('click') and bundled events into a function... now $(this).addClass('active'); isn't working any more. Any suggestions. Guess the scope is different once inside another function?
[08:16:24] <decx> lolmaus you can .get() on a jquery collection object to create an array
[08:16:59] <lolmaus> decx: i don't need an array of HTML elements. I would like to work with jQuery objects individually.
[08:17:25] <decx> oh right lol
[08:17:28] <decx> it just doesnt mattter
[08:17:32] <decx> $(this)
[08:18:06] <decx> if you can'T live with the jquery induced effect on performance then you can't rely on jquery
[08:18:16] <rmill> alistair: it shouldn't
[08:18:19] <rmill> alistair: http://jsfiddle.net/ykK3x/
[08:19:56] <alistair> thanks rmill, can't see why then, that's how I have it set up...
[08:20:23] <lolmaus> decx: sad truth...
[08:25:22] <Vivekananda> wa5ted: around ?
[08:25:25] <Vivekananda> still
[08:31:46] <wa5ted> yh
[08:32:25] <Vivekananda> heyyy
[08:32:34] <Vivekananda> now you would be tired and sleepy right :)
[08:41:11] <alistair> so why would this cause the displayView function to fire on load rather than click? $('.icon-list-view').on('click', displayView('list'));
[08:42:31] <Vivekananda> wa5ted: ?
[08:42:37] <Vivekananda> tired ? resting !
[08:44:24] <alistair> can I pass an argument like that ok ^^?
[08:44:44] <alistair> meaning ('list')?
[08:45:23] <alistair> thinking maybe the parens is causing it to fire? I dunno...
[08:45:23] <wa5ted> yeah sry
[08:45:38] <wa5ted> Vivekananda: im inand outand yes i restinga  bit
[08:45:44] <wa5ted> and making alls about stuff
[08:48:23] <decx> alistair i don't think you cann pass arguments in the clickfunction like that
[08:48:59] <decx> you can however .on('click',function(e){ displayView('list') })
[08:49:11] <alistair> decx: right, doesn't seem to work... i'll try that thanks :)
[08:50:53] <Vivekananda> no worries wa5ted
[08:51:56] <wa5ted> Vivekananda: if you need somethignask
[08:52:03] <alistair> that works thanks decx but my $(this) inside the function isn't working any more, weird...
[08:52:47] <decx> $(this) inside a displayView function wouldnt be the element that was clicked anymore
[08:53:12] <decx> you can pass that as an extra argument displayView('list', this)
[08:54:05] <decx> or write displayView as a jquery helper function
[08:58:00] <rmill> ya alistair, that's what I was going to suggest.
[08:58:12] <rmill> passing the jQuery obj to the function
[08:58:29] <decx> something like this http://jsfiddle.net/decx/U5aML/
[09:01:14] <alistair> ah, nice. That works
[09:01:23] <rmill> ya lik dis: http://jsfiddle.net/ykK3x/1/
[09:02:18] <decx> to late bra ^^
[09:02:21] <decx> +o
[09:02:29] <duch_kazatel> brao?
[09:02:31] <duch_kazatel> (jokes)
[09:02:55] <decx> no i'm going to laote for holiday and just sayiing good bye
[09:03:19] <alistair> beautiful, cheers guys
[09:04:20] <decx> laote is an actual word wow, german for citizen of laos
[09:04:32] <duch_kazatel> woah.  hahahaha
[09:05:54] <decx> i've been watching the harry potter movies for the first time this weekend, how come he always goes back to his abusive family after the movie finishes
[09:06:11] <duch_kazatel> seriously!
[09:06:29] <rmill> decx: another example can't hurt! ;)
[09:17:36] <Vivekananda> hey everyone
[09:17:40] <Vivekananda> hit duch_kazatel
[09:20:40] <BillCriswell> No reason to hit the guy.
[09:20:51] <duch_kazatel> ouchies!
[09:20:51] <duch_kazatel> D:
[09:20:59] <duch_kazatel> this bug is killing me today.
[09:21:02] <duch_kazatel> and so is Vivekananda
[09:21:05] <wa5ted> lol
[09:21:26] <Vivekananda> duch_kazatel: no no I did not kill anyone nooooooo
[09:21:48] <Vivekananda> wakes up!!   ooo was it just a dream ? hmmm bad one.
[09:21:55] <duch_kazatel> how's everybody's memorial day/monday going?
[09:22:06] <BillCriswell> I forgot it was Memeorial Day, got up, got in the shower and everything and was about to walk out the door and my girlfriend is like "Where are you going?
[09:22:10] <Vivekananda> I am memorizing your name currently
[09:22:52] <wa5ted> BillCriswell: dont feel bad, for us workaholics thats just typical
[09:23:03] <BillCriswell> wa5ted: It's rough.
[09:23:13] <wa5ted> yup
[09:23:26] <wa5ted> BillCriswell: but it is cause we are like this that we push what we can do
[09:23:34] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell i don't get memorial day off by default, which is fine because i have stuff i wanted to play with anyway.
[09:25:50] <BillCriswell> I'm coming up on the last episodes of Curb Your Enthusiasm.
[09:26:20] <Vivekananda> I am watching animations and they dont make enough for me to watch in the free time
[09:27:20] <Vivekananda> like beware the batman.  also waiting for the 3 other awesome ones to start which are : Gotham ,  flash  , and costantine
[09:36:48] <decx> what are you memoriolizing?
[09:37:33] <decx> BillCriswell nearing the end of curb eh? so you finally got to leon?
[09:37:43] <BillCriswell> decx: Yes.
[09:38:01] <decx> get in that ass?
[09:38:23] <decx> throw a snickerbars paper on the ground, all that shit
[09:38:36] <BillCriswell> That was some quality dialog.
[09:38:58] <decx> i dont think any of that was scripted hehe
[09:39:28] <BillCriswell> The best stuff is rarely scripted haha.
[09:40:50] <BillCriswell> I want to write a CMS but I know it's a really bad idea.
[09:41:09] <Vivekananda> BillCriswell: a cms no less. wny not use one of the present ones ?
[09:41:52] <JustMadMike> Hello, I'm loading  a bunch of pages into one page using $.get() and an array of page name with $.each
[09:41:55] <decx> i wrote a cms with angular, using on partial for news and 3 for static pages ;)
[09:41:57] <decx> one*
[09:42:16] <JustMadMike> I need to execute a function once all the .gets have finished
[09:42:19] <JustMadMike> but struggling to do so
[09:43:14] <decx> var request = $.ajax(); request.done(function(){ after })
[09:43:41] <JustMadMike> so basically just use ajax instead of get?
[09:44:05] <decx> you can do var request = $.get as well
[09:44:15] <decx> .done will work as well
[09:44:22] <BillCriswell> $.when.apply([$.get(), $.get(), $.get()]).done() is what I think you're shooting for.
[09:44:32] <JustMadMike> hm, problem here is im making multiple requests, i need to wait until they're all finishes
[09:44:37] <decx> oh when all are ready
[09:44:44] <decx> ya bill has it
[09:45:16] <JustMadMike> great, assuming i can throw my each in there?
[09:45:24] <decx> doubtful
[09:46:07] <BillCriswell> JustMadMike: You would do like: var requests = []; $.each(function(){ requests.push($.get('foo.php')); }); $.when.apply(requests).done();
[09:46:49] <JustMadMike> this is what i have so far
[09:46:50] <JustMadMike> http://pastebin.com/b1v51TaL
[09:46:59] <decx> what kind of person are you, getting shit done on a monday so fast
[09:47:43] <decx> i moved background images around, wrote some emails, checked if bills were paid. that's about as good as a productive workmonday is going to get
[09:48:04] <BillCriswell> decx: Haha.
[09:48:33] <Jattenalle> decx, sounds like you have overexerted yourself! you should probably call in sick the rest of the week
[09:48:35] <Jattenalle> better safe than sorry
[09:48:37] <JustMadMike> haha
[09:48:45] <decx> so like last week then
[09:48:52] <decx> jsut without the productive monday
[09:48:53] <JustMadMike> I told the other half i'd sort this out for her this weekend
[09:49:17] <JustMadMike> * now i dont think you're talking to myself.
[09:49:43] <decx> i did however play like 20 hours of supraball
[09:49:53] <decx> that counts?
[09:50:45] <hughajwood> Q: I can't safely use noconflict with my CMS Intranet Portal due to it loaded scripts on demand, it could cause weird bugs in the system due to continuity. Can I therefore is there a way of wrapping the library up, so I can Quarantine its usage only to myself?
[09:53:58] <DeltaHeavy> hughajwood: I'm not 100% sure but instead of $(document).ready(function () { ... });, do the following
[09:54:09] <DeltaHeavy> (function($, undefined) { ... })(jQuery);
[09:55:07] <BillCriswell> JustMadMike: In the doen() callback all the responses will be there in order so you can probably loop through arguments?
[09:55:24] <hughajwood> I think I see where you are going with that Delta
[09:56:39] <JustMadMike> Sorry BillCriswell, I'm not quite following. to my understanding my done() callback will hold the function I would like to execute after all get()s finish
[09:56:58] <DeltaHeavy> hughajwood: I wrap all my jQ code in that now as apperently it's a lot more modular.
[09:57:15] <DeltaHeavy> I don't really fully understand it though, I think I do, but I'm unsure.
[09:57:29] <hughajwood> its ensuring $ is jQuery
[09:57:46] <hughajwood> and undefined is undefined, which is done in jQuery anyway
[09:58:20] <JustMadMike> BillCriswell: Or are you saying I should't be using the get callback to manipulate the response. I can access all data within my done() callback?
[09:59:40] <BillCriswell> JustMadMike: Second thing.
[10:00:56] <JustMadMike> BillCriswell: Will give that approach a go, thanks for the help dude
[10:05:02] <BillCriswell> JustMadMike: http://jsbin.com/hepamisu/3/edit?js,output here's a quick demo.
[10:05:51] <BillCriswell> decx: This last episode is out of control.
[10:06:14] <BillCriswell> "Eeeeeeh I think he might be gay"
[10:06:29] <decx> it's been too long since i curbed
[10:06:51] <BillCriswell> decx: With Michael J Foxx and Larry's girlfriends gay son.
[10:06:53] <decx> i don't know if some bitch stole my name or if i just registered with a strange email on git -.-
[10:07:43] <hughajwood> I can fool the no conflict by wrapping jQuery up, I think this will work (wrapping jquery inside its own file) clb = clb || {"$":{}}; (function($) { /*... jQuery original code ... */ })(clb.$); clb.$ = jQuery.noconflict();
[10:08:50] <hughajwood> not even sure if I need that noconflict
[10:10:31] <decx> haha i had to watch the first few minutes of it to reignite the memory BillCriswell
[10:11:13] <decx> get a life jews... lol
[10:11:50] <BillCriswell> That kid is awesome.
[10:13:07] <BillCriswell> JustMadMike: Did that demo make sense?
[10:14:11] <drej> sup BillCriswell
[10:14:14] <drej> hows life treating you
[10:14:26] <BillCriswell> drej: It's all right. Yourself?
[10:14:46] <drej> not bad, i mean its monday, but as far as mondays are concerned, pretty good :)
[10:16:42] <BillCriswell> drej: Oh yeah you're working today, Canada and all.
[10:16:49] <drej> yeah
[10:16:52] <drej> we had last monday off
[10:17:11] <BillCriswell> Oh nice.
[10:17:22] <BillCriswell> I want more days off.
[10:17:33] <drej> yeah, i hear you, especially now that the weather is getting good
[10:17:35] <decx> is it bad that i always agree with larry....
[10:18:04] <decx> technically right is the best kind of right
[10:18:12] <BillCriswell> decx: I am with him like... 90% of the time. 10% of the time he seems way off.
[10:18:24] <decx> yeah that's about right haha
[10:19:43] <decx> ahaha the soda
[10:19:52] <decx> damnit i have to watch all curb eps again
[10:19:55] <decx> ...
[10:20:02] <BillCriswell> decx: I always agree with The Joker.
[10:20:08] <BillCriswell> That makes me feel not very sane.
[10:20:22] <decx> eh, at least you're not a rich asshole running around in tights
[10:20:27] <BillCriswell> True.
[10:20:51] <decx> with a speechimpediment
[10:20:57] <JustMadMike> BillCriswell: decx , thanks again guys. thats working fine now.
[10:21:08] <BillCriswell> JustMadMike: Awesome. Did you see the link I posted?
[10:21:27] <JustMadMike> BillCriswell: Yup, that helped a lot
[10:21:33] <BillCriswell> OK awesome.
[10:24:28] <JustMadMike> BillCriswell: It's a one page site, so was trying to make it 'seo friendly', so it using the url to load that content with php, the rest with jquery.
[10:26:04] <BillCriswell> decx: Did you ever watch Summer Heights High?
[10:28:26] <decx> australian the office in highschool?
[10:29:19] <decx> i don't think i ever watched an australian series
[10:29:45] <frank_o> australian cinema is awesome though
[10:29:54] <frank_o> much respect to those guys
[10:30:09] <BillCriswell> decx: I don't get an office vibe from it.
[10:30:35] <decx> what like mad max frank_o ?
[10:30:57] <duch_kazatel> i saw the word SEO in a chat room about a jquery lib.  that's never a good thing.
[10:31:18] <duch_kazatel> *javascript lib
[10:31:22] <duch_kazatel> D:
[10:31:43] <decx> i thought seo is dead now
[10:32:02] <decx> keywords and backlinks are over, it's only about social
[10:32:37] <duch_kazatel> not in the slightest - my company still relies on it quite a bit.
[10:33:03] <duch_kazatel> lots of folks do in fact.
[10:33:22] <decx> i have no idea
[10:33:56] <duch_kazatel> the funny part imo is the less you worry about SEO and the more you worry about good content, the better your SEO.
[10:37:40] <frank_o> decx: chopper, balibo, samson and delilah
[10:37:55] <frank_o> couple of other ones i forgot the names of
[10:38:30] <decx> i didnt watch any of these
[10:38:39] <decx> but i did watch mad max... so your point stands ;>
[10:39:09] <frank_o> havent seen that one :)
[10:39:25] <decx> wat
[10:42:30] <MantasK> hey im using flexslider, i want my slider to swipe vertically on desktops and horizontally on mobile/tablets. how should i do that?
[10:43:36] <duch_kazatel> detect browse size on load and configure accordingly.
[10:43:50] <duch_kazatel> detect current browser at the server level and load up the correct assets.
[10:44:00] <duch_kazatel> probably others.
[10:47:16] <decx> MantasK var mydirection = (window.innerWidth > 800) ? 'horizontal' : 'vertical'; $('.slider').flexslider({ direction: mydirection })
[10:49:58] <duch_kazatel> there you go.
[10:50:00] <duch_kazatel> decx ftw
[10:50:48] <decx> put in whatever test for mobile you're most comfortable with
[10:50:58] <decx> innerwidth is misleading
[10:52:05] <rmill> decx: yep
[10:53:02] <rmill> decx: And the whole includeMargin param for outerWidth
[11:03:24] <MantasK__> shouldnt it be better to detect touch device?
[11:04:04] <BillCriswell> There Will Be Blood is perfect.
[11:12:25] <atlasloewenherz> hi everyone
[11:13:07] <wa5ted> hi
[11:14:03] <duch_kazatel> hello
[11:17:04] <atlasloewenherz> im trying to sent a post request using this snippet but for some reasons i get a "GET"-request instead https://gist.github.com/atlasloewenherz/8f89f8da9bf6c8111227
[11:26:18] <jParkton> I have a newb question
[11:26:59] <jParkton> once I have a div targeted what method do I need to run my function I was using body onload=myfunc()
[11:27:14] <duch_kazatel> don't do that.
[11:27:28] <duch_kazatel> oh derp.
[11:27:29] <jParkton> right so what do I use now? bind
[11:27:30] <duch_kazatel> use a document ready,
[11:27:40] <jParkton> I did
[11:27:46] <jParkton> one sec
[11:28:03] <duch_kazatel> $(function() {/* your code here*/ });
[11:29:35] <najemnyvrah> is it possible to make these two lines into one?   var array = number.split(".");   var second = parseInt(array[1]);
[11:30:18] <jParkton> derp
[11:30:24] <jParkton> it works on jsbin not local
[11:30:29] <jParkton> lol something I did is wrong
[11:31:51] <jParkton> nice it worked
[11:31:54] <jParkton> :)
[11:35:03] <ThomasCrown> Good Day.
[11:35:28] <ThomasCrown> Does anyone have a coupole of minutes to point me in the direction where I have gone wrong on my code?
[11:35:42] <duch_kazatel> !ask @ ThomasCrown
[11:35:42] <b-ot> ThomasCrown: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[11:36:43] <ThomasCrown> my apologies, I didn't know the room rules.
[11:37:16] <atlasloewenherz> anyone of you guys trying to send a post request and gets a GET request sent instead ?? even after specifiying request type to be POST ?
[11:40:44] <ThomasCrown> I am building a script that can input mulitple dates and times. The frist excution of the script grabs the vaules that are needed and posts them into mysql database. When i go to add another time and date, it still grabs the same vaules and i can't figure out a way to get the newest input datasets.
[11:59:17] <jParkton> this may sound dumb but when I try to add a second function I get errors, do I have to do everything inside one funct http://jsbin.com/yufev/1
[12:08:11] <legrandin> hi
[12:08:48] <legrandin> so im trying to put a dom element into a variable based on the name, and this doesnt seem to work
[12:08:50] <legrandin> var student = $('input#right').attr('name', frm.attr('name'));
[12:08:54] <legrandin> what should i do?
[12:09:45] <legrandin> how do you select an input by one of its values? is .each the only way to do it?
[12:10:55] <jParkton> $('#idName')
[12:11:16] <legrandin> sorry, i have about 10 inputs with the same id
[12:11:23] <NoiseEee> legrandin: thats invalid markup yo
[12:11:33] <NoiseEee> same name, sure, understandable
[12:11:34] <jParkton> word
[12:11:39] <decx> also attr with 2 arguments is a setter
[12:11:42] <legrandin> what do you mean invalid markup
[12:11:50] <jParkton> only one id per element
[12:11:52] <legrandin> yeah i realize that now, but how do i get an input based on name
[12:12:09] <legrandin> lol really? well it works :/
[12:12:18] <NoiseEee> legrandin: for now
[12:12:22] <jParkton> ^
[12:12:25] <decx> it's literally in the name, identifier :>
[12:12:27] <legrandin> what would make it fail
[12:12:34] <NoiseEee> legrandin: trying to do things with an ID, for one
[12:12:43] <NoiseEee> legrandin: fix it, there's no need for that
[12:12:47] <legrandin> ok fine
[12:13:00] <legrandin> so if i change it to classes i still have the same problem
[12:13:14] <NoiseEee> no, you can easily select by name or class.
[12:13:16] <shoky> jParkton: your "clock" function is being used as the callback passed to $(document).ready(..)
[12:13:28] <legrandin> how do i selecr by name
[12:13:33] <NoiseEee> legrandin: $('input[name=SomeInputName]')
[12:13:37] <legrandin> oh durr
[12:13:39] <legrandin> thanks
[12:13:40] <shoky> jParkton: maybe you meant..  http://jsbin.com/yagitate/1/edit
[12:13:58] <shoky> jParkton: er also  it's $(document)  not $('document')
[12:14:03] <d0de> I want to delete any iframes from a string of html before I inject it into the DOM. How can I do that?
[12:14:06] <jParkton> doh!
[12:14:09] <jParkton> ty
[12:14:34] <NoiseEee> d0de: someString.find('iframe').remove()
[12:14:36] <jParkton> so if I want three four or so functions called at ready can I not do that?
[12:14:47] <d0de> NoiseEee, thanks
[12:14:55] <jParkton> ohh
[12:14:57] <jParkton> ok
[12:14:57] <NoiseEee> d0de: $(someString).find('iframe').remove() if its just a pure string
[12:14:58] <legrandin> umm, NoiseEee, what if they are both inputs and both have the same name
[12:15:25] <NoiseEee> legrandin: i give up, whats another way of asking for the element you actually mean? is it the first? second? etc
[12:15:59] <d0de> NoiseEee, won't that leave the other markup in place, like "<iframe>foo</iframe" will become "<>foo</>" ? Ideally I'd like to strip everything between the tags
[12:16:15] <NoiseEee> d0de: no, it would remove the element. try it and see.
[12:16:22] <legrandin> ok, all names are the same. theres a button which effects another input (a checkbox) and both have the same name
[12:16:26] <decx> i dont think the string will change
[12:16:56] <legrandin> so can i do input.right[name='nae']
[12:17:15] <NoiseEee> legrandin: sounds like you need to organize things way better, like giving name to things that should have the same names (and not other names), and dump all those crazy IDs
[12:17:33] <NoiseEee> legrandin: input[type=checkbox][name='whatever'] iirc
[12:17:41] <ThomasCrown> I am trying to $.post vaules into mysql database from this script and every new field it creates it works, but it keeps posting the same orginal values into mysql and not the newest vars http://jsbin.com/kinekesa/1/edit
[12:17:53] <shoky> jParkton: you can do it like i showed, or if you really want you can do  $(document).ready(function1).ready(function2)
[12:18:07] <d0de> NoiseEee, neat, thanks!
[12:18:24] <NoiseEee> np d0de
[12:18:27] <legrandin> well if you saw my code you would know why everything has to have a unique name and the same id/class
[12:18:49] <decx> $(string).find('stuf ).remove() won't change string
[12:20:08] <NoiseEee> legrandin: things sharing a class, great... fact is you're code is no good :)
[12:20:16] <NoiseEee> legrandin: organize it better
[12:20:23] <legrandin> thats funny because you havent seen my code
[12:20:30] <legrandin> how are you able to judge code you havent read
[12:20:32] <NoiseEee> legrandin: "everything needs the same id" = bad code.
[12:20:36] <d0de> On a similar note, given a long html string, I want to strip out any "width" and "height" attributes that are included as inline styles
[12:20:39] <legrandin> i didnt come here for a code review, either
[12:20:54] <legrandin> it's rather impolite to give code reviews when they arent explicitley asked for
[12:20:59] <NoiseEee> legrandin: if you don't change it now, at one point you will be in a world of pain
[12:21:04] <legrandin> i AM changing it
[12:21:13] <legrandin> but i wish that you would be a little less condescending
[12:21:36] <NoiseEee> legrandin: i don't mean to be. if you have the power to change the markup, toss in classes/names that make the JS easier
[12:21:39] <shoky> he's not being condescending at all, really. he's purely trying to help
[12:21:55] <legrandin> "fact is you're code is no good" isnt condescending?
[12:21:59] <shoky> not at all
[12:22:09] <decx> looks like an objective fact to me
[12:22:11] <shoky> if your code depends on duplicate id's, it's not good
[12:22:16] <legrandin> it doesnt
[12:22:16] <shoky> and you should know that
[12:22:21] <shoky> so he told you
[12:22:23] <shoky> now you know
[12:22:28] <NoiseEee> well i certainly do feel crummy for spelling it "you're"
[12:22:35] <shoky> ;]
[12:22:35] <decx> yikes
[12:22:40] <decx> to the fire with you then
[12:24:40] <d0de> oh, decx, you're right about $(string).find().remove() not changing the string. What can I do to get it to change the string?
[12:25:30] <BillCriswell> I really hope I had off today.
[12:25:36] <decx> fragment stuff
[12:25:36] <shoky> var dom = $(string);   dom.find(..).remove();     smth.append(dom);
[12:25:37] <BillCriswell> I assumed I'd have heard something by now.
[12:25:46] <decx> ya like that
[12:26:09] <legrandin> why didnt you call your office, bill?
[12:26:17] <decx> that would remove all doubt
[12:26:27] <decx> classic noob lazy assholes mistake
[12:26:46] <legrandin> lol
[12:27:35] <decx> you gotta play the milford men when you're taking the day off not knowing if you actually took the day off
[12:27:38] <decx> man*
[12:28:00] <BillCriswell> legrandin: I have no good answer for that.
[12:28:02] <decx> http://i.imgur.com/euOgvgg.png
[12:28:24] <BillCriswell> I think I played it right.
[12:28:36] <d0de> decx, shoky, thanks. Can you explain why that works?
[12:28:40] <legrandin> seems like it would be hard to enjoy the day if youre always wondering whether you should be working
[12:29:22] <decx> d0de because dom is a new object separate from string
[12:29:53] <BillCriswell> legrandin: I can play dumb.
[12:30:04] <BillCriswell> Unless they look at IRC logs for #jquery, then I'm kind of screwed.
[12:30:06] <d0de> ok, that makes sense
[12:30:25] <legrandin> LOL
[12:30:26] <NotBillCriswell> Tracks are covered.
[12:30:34] <d0de> On a similar note, given a long HTML string, how can I strip out any "width" or "height" inline styles?
[12:31:01] <legrandin> ctrl+f?
[12:31:24] <NotBillCriswell> d0de: html.replace(/(width|height)/g, '')
[12:31:31] <NotBillCriswell> Wait no.
[12:31:35] <legrandin> oh lol
[12:32:08] <decx> find('img').each(function(){ $(this).removeAttr('width').removeAttr('height') })
[12:32:12] <shoky> er
[12:32:13] <NotBillCriswell> d0de: html.replace(/(width|height):\s*([^";])/g, '')
[12:32:15] <decx> or something
[12:32:23] <NotBillCriswell> d0de: Shouldn't need to do this.
[12:32:26] <shoky> attribute is "style"
[12:32:44] <NotBillCriswell> d0de: The way I look at it... if something is a giant pain in the ass to accomplish. I approach it another way.
[12:32:52] <decx> i know it's 2014 but there are still width and height attributes shoky ;)
[12:33:15] <d0de> regular expressions are black magic to me
[12:33:17] <shoky> decx heh but he asked about inline styles ;s
[12:33:26] <NotBillCriswell> d0de: They're evil.
[12:33:33] <decx> shit you're right
[12:33:53] <d0de> you're right, but decx is right in intuiting what I actually meant
[12:34:02] <d0de> or rather, what I intended to mean
[12:34:03] <decx> bam
[12:34:16] <NotBillCriswell> decx, psychic
[12:34:25] <NotBillCriswell> shoky: logic
[12:34:31] <decx> i don't know if removeAttr has teh same limitation as attr() only taking the first in a collection into account
[12:34:39] <decx> so i just put an each in there
[12:34:55] <shoky> ok, you win, it's 2014
[12:35:04] <d0de> NotBillCriswell, can you give a general idea of what the ":\s*([^";])" part does? :S
[12:35:08] <d0de> or anyone
[12:35:24] <shoky> think he forgot a * there
[12:35:28] <NotBillCriswell> d0de: A colon, followed by any number of spaces folowed by anything that's not a " or ;
[12:35:36] <shoky> or a +
[12:35:45] <d0de> I learn very basic regex syntax about once a year, and forget it at the same pace
[12:35:58] <decx> same
[12:36:09] <NotBillCriswell> '<div class="width:100px;height:200px;color:red">Foo</div>'.replace(/(width|height):\s*([^";]+)([";])/g, '')
[12:36:12] <decx> apart from actually learning anything
[12:36:12] <NotBillCriswell> that worked.
[12:36:24] <NotBillCriswell> shoky: I sure did.
[12:36:41] <shoky> NotBillCriswell: why the " ?
[12:36:48] <shoky> oh
[12:36:51] <shoky> nvm
[12:36:59] <NotBillCriswell> shoky: Total shit solution.
[12:37:07] <shoky> NotBillCriswell: nice class name btw ;D
[12:37:13] <NotBillCriswell> dang.
[12:37:25] <decx> what's memorial day anywhere
[12:37:27] <decx> anyway
[12:37:39] <shoky> it's a day where they don't air GoT
[12:37:45] <NotBillCriswell> War stuff.
[12:37:54] <decx> i actually stayed up last night
[12:38:02] <decx> hoping for the epic mountain fight
[12:38:09] <shoky> hah
[12:38:21] <decx> at 3am i gave up
[12:38:29] <decx> then looked it up this morning
[12:38:33] <NotBillCriswell> '<div style="width:100px;height:200px;color:red">Foo</div>'.replace(/(width|height):\s*.*?([";])/g, '')
[12:38:38] <decx> myface: +...+
[12:38:48] <NotBillCriswell> There we go, a little less... greedy/ungreedy.
[12:38:57] <NotBillCriswell> I don't really understand this shit.
[12:39:06] <NotBillCriswell> I could fake it usually.
[12:39:36] <decx> why don't they just stop initiating unnecessary wars as a commemoration of fallen service men
[12:39:38] <decx> ^^
[12:40:32] <NotBillCriswell> Well, as you know, there's rich white men's pockets to be stuffed by initiating democracy across the land.
[12:40:35] <decx> isn't there veterans day also?
[12:41:19] <NotBillCriswell> I think memorial day is for the deceased while veterans is for both?
[12:41:23] <NotBillCriswell> I never thought about it.
[12:41:37] <d0de> Sorry for not expressing my problem well, but the actual markup I need to strip looks like <div class="foo" width="200px" height="100px">The width and height of foo is bar.</div>
[12:41:56] <NotBillCriswell> d0de: Say what?
[12:42:31] <d0de> that didn't make any sense at all
[12:42:35] <d0de> ignore please
[12:42:37] <decx> oh right. memorial. it's right in the name lol
[12:42:54] <NotBillCriswell> d0de: Got it.
[12:44:10] <d0de> NotBillCriswell, ty very much for the regex
[12:44:24] <NotBillCriswell> d0de: That won't work for your situation though.
[12:44:52] <NotBillCriswell> I think you want $('<div class="foo" width="200px" height="100px">').removeAttr('width').removeAttr('height')
[12:45:34] <shoky> .removeAttr('width height') also good
[12:45:37] <ThomasCrown> I am trying to $.post vaules into mysql database from this script and every new field it creates it works, but it keeps posting the same orginal values into mysql and not the newest vars http://jsbin.com/kinekesa/1/edit
[12:46:05] <NotBillCriswell> shoky: I just looked at the manual to try and avoid the double call and didn't see anything.
[12:46:14] <decx> fyi removeAttr doesn't have the same limitation as attr and already has an implied each
[12:46:16] <d0de> I think I need both. I'm pulling in a bunch of stuff via rss and the markup is super dirty. I'm trying to strip out everything I can't override with CSS while preserving as much of the html as possible
[12:46:31] <NotBillCriswell> d0de: It sounds like you're doing something wild.
[12:46:38] <shoky> NotBillCriswell: "as of version 1.7, it can be a space-separated list of attributes."
[12:47:18] <NotBillCriswell> It's always where I don't look.
[12:48:12] <d0de> NotBillCriswell, I'm just working on a toy project to show a nicely formatted list of article headlines and excerpts pulled from a curated list of RSS feeds filtered by a user search term
[12:49:11] <NotBillCriswell> d0de: Where does the height width thing come into play?
[12:49:42] <d0de> some of the rss excerpts have embedded styles (dunno if that's what they're actually called)
[12:49:55] <d0de> and iframes, and other stuff that breaks the display
[12:50:17] <d0de> I've tried overriding with CSS but it doesn't seem to take
[12:50:27] <NotBillCriswell> d0de: Did you use !important?
[12:50:45] <tw2113> !important_i_mean_it
[12:50:46] <d0de> yep
[12:51:06] <NotBillCriswell> d0de: Hmm... that doesn't sound right.
[12:51:16] <tw2113> !ignore_everything_else_if_you_must_to_apply_this_style
[12:51:30] <jParkton> shoky http://jsbin.com/yiwit/2 am I on the right track? I am trying to draw a clock using js
[12:51:52] <d0de> hang on, I'll comment out the filtering and try to get an example up in a fiddle
[12:53:48] <jParkton> anyone
[12:53:51] <jParkton> peas?
[12:56:52] <shoky> jParkton: looks ok.. you're not doing too much yet
[12:57:05] <shoky> jParkton: though that .toFixed()  doesn't seem right there
[12:57:38] <jParkton> I want to create the div and I guess innerhtml that toFixed?
[12:57:42] <jParkton> or is that wrong
[12:57:54] <jParkton> im newb
[12:57:59] <jParkton> so just trying
[12:58:00] <shoky> .toFixed() works on numbers only
[12:58:01] <jParkton> lol
[12:58:08] <jParkton> hm
[12:58:18] <jParkton> wont the clock return to me numbers?
[12:58:33] <jParkton> h m s? or is that wrong data type
[12:58:52] <shoky> jParkton:  h+""+m+""+s   is a string
[12:59:16] <jParkton> oh true
[12:59:25] <jParkton> ok back to the drawing board :)
[13:00:26] <shoky> btw with jquery you could just do  var p = $('<p>', {id: "face"});
[13:00:42] <shoky> p.appendTo('#displayTime');
[13:00:49] <jParkton> oh dangit
[13:00:53] <jParkton> :(
[13:00:53] <shoky> p.html(whatever)
[13:00:54] <shoky> etc
[13:01:16] <jParkton> I spent all day yesterday just making a js file smaller and smaller
[13:01:18] <jParkton> lol
[13:01:42] <duch_kazatel> nice
[13:01:48] <duch_kazatel> can you still read it though?
[13:02:51] <duch_kazatel> also: http://www.winbeta.org/news/registry-hack-lets-you-get-free-security-updates-windows-xp-until-2019
[13:02:56] <jParkton> yupp
[13:03:02] <jParkton> I erased it twice
[13:03:08] <jParkton> made it really easy to read
[13:03:21] <jParkton> windows?
[13:03:25] <jParkton> lol
[13:03:31] <duch_kazatel> people just won't let XP die
[13:04:46] <tw2113> it's like the Firefox Australis stuff
[13:04:52] <tw2113> why break workflows and good things
[13:04:53] <duch_kazatel> i like FF personally.
[13:05:12] <tw2113> people are very resistant to change when it comes to computing it seems
[13:05:21] <drej> or ... anything
[13:05:22] <drej> :)
[13:05:24] <shoky> as they should be
[13:05:38] <duch_kazatel> sometimes that's a good thing.  other times...
[13:05:40] <tw2113> i wonder if those people believe in evolution
[13:05:47] <shoky> its stupid designers that want to change things every tuesday
[13:05:55] <shoky> causing grief
[13:06:27] <duch_kazatel> shoky so glad ours aren't that bad.
[13:06:46] <drej> tw2113 evolution definitely moves a lot slower than the release cycle of operating systems :)
[13:06:56] <tw2113> but they hate change
[13:07:01] <drej> climate change
[13:07:17] <tw2113> currency change too, i bet
[13:09:11] <d0de> Hrm. I'm using masonry.js but it's displaying incorrectly because when it first runs, none of the images in the excerpts have loaded
[13:12:49] <duch_kazatel> d0de are you running it first on doc ready?
[13:13:00] <duch_kazatel> maybe try window load instead?
[13:15:00] <d0de> duch_kazatel, I'm loading a bunch of entries from various RSS feeds and I don't know in advance how many entries there will be. At the moment I'm calling masonry every time a new entry is appended into the DOM
[13:15:15] <duch_kazatel> O.O
[13:15:36] <duch_kazatel> that's... inefficient.  why aren't you working against a fragment and appending that once instead?
[13:18:01] <d0de> I hadn't really thought about it. I guess because I want content to load sooner rather than later, and sometimes there will be many entries to load and it will take a long time for everything to be ready. I guess I could load them 10 at a time or smthing
[13:19:05] <duch_kazatel> either do basic pagination OR do something like oboe.js
[13:21:24] <thoraxe> dumb question -- I have a form and a button and it appears that even though the button is not a "Submit" button, the form is still being submitted when the button is clicked. here's the coffeescript: https://gist.github.com/thoraxe/b7d9e8cd368c75bdb8c1 -- the form seems to be being submitted anyway when I click the button
[13:21:57] <duch_kazatel> ugh coffeescript.
[13:22:32] <duch_kazatel> can you share your HTML?
[13:22:57] <__joshua___> there doesn't seem to be anything wrong in your cs
[13:22:57] <thoraxe> duch_kazatel: i updated the gist with the haml for the button
[13:23:08] <thoraxe> __joshua___: yeah, i can't seem to figure out why it's submitting right now
[13:23:11] <duch_kazatel> thoraxe >.>
[13:23:12] <NoiseEee> thoraxe: first thing to do would be putting a listener on the form itself to stop submissions.
[13:23:13] <thoraxe> teh button type is button
[13:23:25] <thoraxe> NoiseEee: i like that idea
[13:23:39] <duch_kazatel> listen to NoiseEee - I can barely understand what any of this code is doing.
[13:23:49] <thoraxe> duch_kazatel: it shouldn't be doing anything, really
[13:24:00] <thoraxe> it should do some junk and then just sit there, but it's submitting the form
[13:24:01] <NoiseEee> thoraxe: ie: you don't want an 'enter' key to submit your form either
[13:24:02] <__joshua___> duch_kazatel its basically js
[13:24:12] <d0de> duch, you're right, thanks
[13:24:13] <thoraxe> NoiseEee: yeah, about to look up how to do that
[13:25:00] <__joshua___> either the submit handler or get the keypress
[13:25:11] <thoraxe> NoiseEee: that work? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21418297/jquery-listening-to-form-submit-events
[13:25:21] <thoraxe> about to tias
[13:25:22] <NoiseEee> sure that'd work
[13:27:57] <jParkton> shoky: in that var p = $('<p>', {id:"Some"}) is that id part json? like can I do {id:"Some", style:"border: 2px solid grey;"}?
[13:28:39] <__joshua___> thoraxe: i think button elements default to type="submit".  Can you inspect the type of the rendered button?
[13:28:58] <__joshua___> because if you don't have a submit button, you don't need to worry about preventing submits
[13:29:08] <shoky> jParkton: it's not json.. but it's a js object literal, yeah. you can read about what you can pass there here  http://api.jquery.com/jQuery/#jQuery-html-attributes
[13:29:20] <jParkton> ty
[13:29:30] <jParkton> sometimes I just dont know what to look for
[13:29:40] <duch_kazatel> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv5b1Xowxdk - this is pretty impressive.
[13:29:57] <shoky> jParkton: i'd actually prefer  $('<p>').attr({id:"Some"}).addClass('someclass')
[13:30:07] <jParkton> truth
[13:30:18] <shoky> i'd probably also prefer not putting an id at all
[13:30:30] <shoky> if it's an element i'm creating myself, then i already have a reference to it
[13:30:30] <jParkton> also with my clock thing I can use parseHTML on the returned string?
[13:30:44] <jParkton> thats true
[13:31:00] <jParkton> I never use id in my templates
[13:31:08] <jParkton> only in js did I start lol
[13:31:11] <shoky> parseHTML? don't see what you'd need that for
[13:31:30] <jParkton> instead of the toFixed thing I was doing?
[13:31:45] <shoky> there was no html involved there..
[13:32:10] <shoky> i don't know what exactly you wanted to do there, so can't say what the right thing to do is ;p
[13:32:12] <thoraxe> __joshua___: type=button
[13:32:12] <jParkton> dang
[13:32:22] <jParkton> its ok
[13:32:23] <thoraxe> the weird thing is that the javascript doesn't even submit the form
[13:32:28] <jParkton> I will figure it out as I go
[13:32:39] <thoraxe> and if there's no file selected, which prevents the readsinglefile event from doing anything, the form does nothing
[13:32:43] <jParkton> just making a clock using the most complex time consuming method I can
[13:32:48] <thoraxe> it's only when the file is read and processed that the form gets submitted, but I can't figure out why
[13:32:53] <jParkton> at least that is what is being accomplished
[13:32:54] <jParkton> lol
[13:32:57] <shoky> heh
[13:33:13] <jParkton> just making things so I can learn
[13:33:14] <shoky> what do you want that makeClock function to return..
[13:33:43] <shoky> concatenating hours,mins,secs like that doesn't make much sense
[13:33:50] <jParkton> I think I need to change the whole deal I want to just use clock(h) and get hour clock(m) and get minute
[13:34:12] <jParkton> its ok though just something to teach me how much fail I am
[13:34:15] <jParkton> :)
[13:34:27] <thoraxe> https://gist.github.com/thoraxe/b7d9e8cd368c75bdb8c1 updated with prevent default listener
[13:34:46] <thoraxe> NoiseEee: should the preventdefault be on the form itself, the button, or both?
[13:34:52] <duch_kazatel> the form
[13:34:53] <NoiseEee> it should be on the form
[13:34:54] <shoky> jParkton: you could do something like:  return {h: h, m: m, s: s};
[13:35:13] <shoky> jParkton: then var myTime = clockTime();   myTime.h  myTime.m ..
[13:35:16] <jParkton> oh
[13:35:27] <jParkton> ok
[13:35:45] <jParkton> is that returning an obj?
[13:35:50] <shoky> yep
[13:35:55] <jParkton> nailed it
[13:35:56] <jParkton> ok
[13:36:15] <thoraxe> ok well, i had a typo (wrong id for preventDefault), but I fixed that, and it's still submitting
[13:36:29] <xniz> ive got a simple question. i have created an image object using img = new Image() with an onload function. how would i go about appending this image object into a div?
[13:36:40] <shoky> jParkton: or you could just do... var myTime = new Date();  myTime.getHours()  myTime.getMinutes() ...    :)
[13:36:40] <xniz> i know i need to use $().append, just not sure how to use the syntax
[13:36:53] <duch_kazatel> $('div').append(yourImg)
[13:37:00] <__joshua___> thoraxe: can we see the full rendered html?
[13:37:02] <xniz> alright. thank you :P
[13:37:07] <thoraxe> __joshua___: yeah one sec let me clean it up
[13:37:10] <duch_kazatel> xniz why are you using new Image() ?
[13:37:21] <jParkton> jes
[13:37:34] <xniz> duch_kazatel, dynamically changing between images
[13:37:41] <duch_kazatel> xniz not following.
[13:37:44] <__joshua___> duch: because you get a load event?
[13:38:00] <duch_kazatel> you can get a load event by setting src, too...
[13:38:08] <duch_kazatel> at least, I thought you could.
[13:39:05] <xniz> duch_kazatel,  hmm well..basically, i am coding a library similar to colorbox. i have a prototype Gallery.prototype.viewImage which loads the specified image and displays it on the screen
[13:39:10] <thoraxe> https://gist.github.com/thoraxe/b7d9e8cd368c75bdb8c1 __joshua___
[13:39:37] <xniz> and voila... that worked. thank you duch
[13:39:56] <thoraxe> i would expect that clicking the button here should encrypt the file and then do nothing
[13:40:02] <duch_kazatel> thoraxe ("file-form") - your HTML is file_form
[13:40:08] <thoraxe> duch_kazatel: yeah sorry, didn't edit that
[13:40:10] <duch_kazatel> so you want $('file_form')
[13:40:19] <thoraxe> it is right in my code
[13:40:20] <duch_kazatel> orr $('#file_form')
[13:40:21] <thoraxe> just not the gist
[13:40:31] <__joshua___>    $("file-form") should be    $("#file_form")
[13:40:36] <__joshua___> ah, you guys saw it too
[13:40:56] <thoraxe> refresh the gist
[13:40:57] <thoraxe> sorry
[13:41:11] <duch_kazatel> thoraxe again, $("file_form") -> $("#file_form")
[13:41:18] <thoraxe> gah
[13:41:19] <duch_kazatel> your selector is wrong.
[13:41:25] <thoraxe> yeah
[13:41:26] <thoraxe> true
[13:41:48] <thoraxe> yeah that fixed it
[13:41:48] <thoraxe> awesome
[13:41:49] <thoraxe> thanks
[13:42:07] <duch_kazatel> also: you can now put all your logic after that preventdefault instead of having it bound to the button submit event.
[13:42:13] <duch_kazatel> *button click event, rathger.
[13:42:31] <thoraxe> duch_kazatel: so you mean inside the submit button put all the rest of the reader and other stuff?
[13:42:40] <duch_kazatel> insite the submit event handler.
[13:42:43] <thoraxe> yes sorry
[13:42:46] <duch_kazatel> *insidee
[13:43:20] <duch_kazatel> and yeah, that way you have one listener/handler you're dealing with, instead of two.,

[14:10:43] <tp43_> how do you explicitly call an immediate executing function?
[14:11:58] <duch_kazatel> you mean like (function(){})(); ?
[14:12:33] <duch_kazatel> because you don't afaik
[14:12:38] <tp43_> duch_kazatel, yeah, but if you give it a name, nevermind though, I changed my mind about what I was trying to do
[14:17:05] <duch_kazatel> what were you trying to do?
[14:21:12] <xniz> hmmm
[14:21:48] <duch_kazatel> mmmh
[14:22:24] <uskerine> how can i refer a select with name="foo" inside a form with id="superForm"
[14:22:25] <uskerine> ?
[14:22:37] <uskerine> $('#superForm name="foo"')
[14:22:37] <uskerine> ?
[14:22:47] <duch_kazatel> $('#superForm [name="foo"]')
[14:22:50] <uskerine> thanks

[14:24:32] <uskerine> $('#superForm [name="foo"]:checked').val()
[14:24:34] <uskerine> is this valid?
[14:26:42] <dcope> why would changing an elements background image cause a flicker?
[14:26:51] <dcope> and yes, the new image has been preloaded succesfully.
[14:27:21] <tp43_> is it safe to call clearTImeout even if you didn't setTimeout?
[14:28:37] <tp43_> yep, seems safe
[14:28:41] <NotBillCriswell> tp43_: Not sure it would do you any good since clearTimeout() wouldn't do anything without the id passed to it.
[14:30:19] <tp43_> NotBillCriswell, yeah, see thing is, I have a condition loop that does t1 = setTimeout or t2 = setTimeout, so I can't always know which on is set, so I just clearTimeout(t1); clearTimeout(t2);
[14:30:58] <NotBillCriswell> tp43_: I thought you wanted to just do clearTimeout() without an id.
[14:31:14] <freebirD2> you guys, when I use <script>jQuery( "#dialog" ).dialog();</script> in html, works just fine, when I insert jQuery( "#dialog" ).dialog(); inside a js function, doesn't work, should I pass a parameter to the function ? am I doing it wrong ? please
[14:31:35] <duch_kazatel> "inside a js function" - are you calling the function?
[14:31:44] <tp43_> NotBillCriswell, oh
[14:31:46] <freebirD2> yeah, duch_kazatel
[14:32:09] <freebirD2> I call the functoin, and I expect the same to run this code: jQuery( "#dialog" ).dialog();
[14:32:21] <freebirD2> that works anywhere in the page, but inside the function
[14:32:26] <duch_kazatel> !paste @ freebirD2
[14:32:27] <b-ot> freebirD2: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[14:34:51] <dcope> nobody knows why changing a background image would cause a quick flicker? :(
[14:35:22] <duch_kazatel> dcope be more specific?  what's flickering?  do you have an example up somewhere?
[14:35:30] <freebirD2> duch_kazatel, see, it's something like this, first function with alertify, is called when I push a button, than, after the button success, it calls the JS function, with the dialog line, that doesn't work,   http://jsfiddle.net/4MzU9/
[14:35:37] <dcope> duch_kazatel: when i change the background image the element goes blank for a second
[14:35:41] <dcope> i'll post a demo on jsfiddle now
[14:35:48] <uskerine> http://pastebin.com/2iUVhcxt
[14:35:59] <uskerine> how could i simulate with JQuery to click on <a href="#tab2_view....
[14:35:59] <uskerine> ?
[14:36:07] <duch_kazatel> uskerine .trigger('click')
[14:36:17] <uskerine> thanks!
[14:36:29] <duch_kazatel> freebirD2b >.> "it's something like this" - give me a functioning examplke.
[14:36:48] <freebirD2> duch_kazatel, http://jsfiddle.net/4MzU9/
[14:36:57] <duch_kazatel> a functioning example, not that.,
[14:37:01] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/4MzU9/1/
[14:37:11] <freebirD2> that's the problem man, it doesn't work
[14:37:17] <duch_kazatel> you didn't include jquery originally, and your HTMl was in your JS.
[14:37:24] <duch_kazatel> you want to run some code when you click a link?
[14:37:49] <freebirD2> inside the JS function, I'm calling the dialog like this: jQuery( "#dialog" ).dialog();   , it's probably wrong
[14:38:12] <freebirD2> duch_kazatel, this call probably looks like something else, or the function must recieve a parameter
[14:38:20] <BillCriswell> freebirD2: $('order') isn't right.
[14:38:44] <BillCriswell> Either is $('order').onclick = function(){};
[14:39:08] <duch_kazatel> and don't return false like this.  use .on() to bind./
[14:39:09] <duch_kazatel> etc
[14:39:28] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/4MzU9/2/
[14:39:30] <BillCriswell> $('#order').on('click', function () {}); is what I assume you're going for.
[14:39:34] <duch_kazatel> it'll look more like that.
[14:40:24] <BillCriswell> Also look into $.ajax() since you have jQuery loaded anyway.
[14:40:38] <freebirD2> I see, but will the dialog line work after that ?
[14:40:55] <duch_kazatel> freebirD2 make those changes and then look at your console.
[14:43:20] <freebirD2> duch_kazatel, did the changes, and now alertify is not being called anymoer
[14:43:23] <freebirD2> anymore
[14:43:29] <duch_kazatel> what does your console say?
[14:44:07] <freebirD2> duch_kazatel, sorry, what would be my console ?
[14:44:12] <freebirD2> firebug ?
[14:44:17] <duch_kazatel> if you have it, sure.
[14:44:21] <BillCriswell> Yes.
[14:44:38] <duch_kazatel> http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide1 <- read this.
[14:44:38] <freebirD2> I really don't know how to degub js, any good tutorials ?
[14:44:40] <freebirD2> lool
[14:44:56] <duch_kazatel> also, when you click the link you'll probably get an error message of some kind.
[14:45:37] <freebirD2> I see, ok you guys, thanks for the support, I'll go to college now, when I come back, I'll keep trying, tks a lot
[14:45:46] <duch_kazatel> wat
[14:46:07] <duch_kazatel> what's with that kind of BS defeatist attitude.
[14:46:24] <freebirD2> me ?
[14:46:29] <duch_kazatel> yeah
[14:46:37] <freebirD2> sorry, what did I do ?
[14:46:45] <duch_kazatel> were you just making a joke?
[14:46:56] <freebirD2> about what ?
[14:46:58] <freebirD2> duch_kazatel,
[14:47:06] <freebirD2> about going to college ?
[14:47:09] <duch_kazatel> yeah...
[14:47:38] <freebirD2> I'll have a test in 20 minutes, so I better get going, when I get back, I'll read the slide you gave me and keep trying
[14:47:42] <freebirD2> what's so wrong about that ?
[14:47:43] <duch_kazatel> ok
[14:48:43] <duch_kazatel> thought you were exaggerating.
[14:49:24] <freebirD2> no man, have a test now, sucks, see ya
[14:50:51] <duch_kazatel> hah.  well there you go.
[15:00:33] <sirhackal> hi
[15:00:51] <sirhackal> is it possible with jquery to load a remote js file and update that reload on interval
[15:01:06] <duch_kazatel> sirhackal D: sure, but why?
[15:01:12] <sirhackal> the remote file woudl be data.js and have stuff liek var data = {prop:val}
[15:01:22] <sirhackal> is it cross browser proof?
[15:01:38] <duch_kazatel> sirhackal slow your roll.
[15:01:39] <sirhackal> i am new to jquery sorry... where do i start my google
[15:01:45] <sirhackal> haha MONSTER
[15:01:59] <duch_kazatel> build out some json, use $.ajax() to request said JSON, and go from there.
[15:02:58] <duch_kazatel> don't do a bunch of data = {prop:val}
[15:03:10] <bowenac> So I am using an example for using ajax to update a bunch of records. I am using url: 'theurl', context: document.body}).done(function() { jQuery( ".attrLoading" ).slideUp(500);});
[15:03:20] <bowenac> any ideas on how to prevent timeouts on something like this?
[15:03:23] <sirhackal> i have no choice .. i am using remote service
[15:03:30] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[15:03:31] <bowenac> or the correct way to run this as a script and prevent from timing out
[15:03:37] <duch_kazatel> what's the remose service?
[15:03:42] <duch_kazatel> *remote
[15:03:54] <sirhackal> a website that exposes data that is not in json
[15:04:01] <sirhackal> just native javascript code
[15:04:29] <duch_kazatel> if this is being built for any sort of mission critical application, don't do that.
[15:04:46] <sirhackal> no its not for NASA lol
[15:04:56] <duch_kazatel> are you doing it for yourself for fun?
[15:04:57] <sirhackal> i have no choice its for a client who wants it done with what he has
[15:05:25] <duch_kazatel> then it is "mission critical" and shouldn't be done.
[15:05:35] <sirhackal> omg what are you the jquery police?
[15:05:43] <sirhackal> what an idiot
[15:05:51] <duch_kazatel> does the other service even support CORS?
[15:06:26] <duch_kazatel> wait so you don't know wtf you're doing, come in here to ask for help, I point out it's a bad idea so you don't get that frantic 3am call about how "the site is down", and I'M an idiot?
[15:07:00] <sirhackal> dude who are you to say whats 'mission critical'
[15:07:08] <sirhackal> thats why your an idiot
[15:07:12] <duch_kazatel> lmao
[15:07:19] <sirhackal> focus on the code/problem not your made up politics
[15:07:22] <duch_kazatel> wtf
[15:07:30] <duch_kazatel> okay - does the remote service support CORS?
[15:07:49] <sirhackal> never mind anyone else know
[15:08:14] <sirhackal> worst caes ill swallow it in php and spit it back out. not rocket science
[15:08:26] <duch_kazatel> fuck you.
[15:08:31] <bowenac> duch_kazatel did you see my question by any chance on how to prevent possible timeouts
[15:08:33] <duch_kazatel> i'm done.
[15:08:49] <sirhackal> haha kids
[15:09:00] <bowenac> when updating possibly 20k records
[15:09:10] <bowenac> using ajax with php script
[15:09:31] <uskerine> is it possible -and if so, is it difficult-  to make modal messages? -like for example, confirming YES/NO before deleting a record-
[15:10:16] <bowenac> couldn't you just use bootstrap for the modal, then if they click yes do the delete...
[15:10:35] <uskerine>  bootstrap is fine
[15:10:46] <bowenac> so whats the problem
[15:11:44] <uskerine> i don't know how to do it
[15:11:47] <uskerine> never used it
[15:11:56] <bowenac> bootstrap?
[15:12:17] <bowenac> just include the script and use this http://www.w3resource.com/twitter-bootstrap/modals-tutorial.php
[15:12:42] <uskerine> thanks
[15:13:14] <tp43_> can we calculate size of scrollbar
[15:13:15] <bowenac> should get you on the right path
[15:15:41] <bowenac> ok no one knows here I will try some where else. Thanks people.
[15:17:32] <sirhackal> the answer is getscript for that 12 yearold that left
[15:21:45] <uskerine> my bootstrap modal window is activated by clicking on <a data-toggle="modal" role="button" href="#small_modal">Small modal</a>, how could I trigger that with JQuery?
[15:22:51] <__joshua___> $('#myModal').modal(options)?

[15:30:11] <needhelp> i need help: Hey. I'll make a Geocache task.
[15:30:11] <needhelp> Have a The background image that I want to hide a div in the image.
[15:30:11] <needhelp> to solve the task must click around the picture, diven will open when you hit the correct location in the image. How do I fix this?
[15:30:11] <needhelp> Here is the picture: http://larry.no/WP/ Here is the code http://larry.no/WP/index.phps
[15:44:45] <BillCriswell> needhelp: You're putting display:none on the picture. You won't be able to click that.
[15:45:58] <needhelp> How do I hide it then?
[15:46:16] <BillCriswell> needhelp: I'm pretty you want opacity: 0 instead of display: none, that'll still allow you to click the element but it just won't be visible.
[15:46:48] <BillCriswell> Do you basically want in invisible spot on the picture that you can click?
[15:46:56] <needhelp> want it to only appear when I click on the correct place in the picture the secret place)
[15:46:58] <needhelp> yes
[15:47:27] <BillCriswell> You can just change the opacity to 1 when it's clicked.
[15:47:54] <needhelp> so you have to try out for hitting. this is a task
[15:48:11] <needhelp> how ?
[15:48:35] <BillCriswell> needhelp: Not following you.
[15:50:48] <needhelp> you realized the place want it to open when the pressure in the right place in the image.
[15:52:23] <BillCriswell> I thought you wanted to hover over a hidden div and show it when the mouse is over it.
[15:54:37] <needhelp> votes!
[15:54:38] <needhelp> yes
[15:54:56] <needhelp> how ?
[15:56:54] <BillCriswell> needhelp: http://jsbin.com/tucokavo/1/edit?js,output this could work. I left the opacity at 0.2 just for testing.
[15:57:44] <BillCriswell> needhelp: http://jsbin.com/tucokavo/2/edit?css,output this could work too
[16:01:31] <needhelp> forgot to say it earlier. location skla never been the same for once the page loads so I made:
[16:01:31] <needhelp> <? php
[16:01:31] <needhelp> $ leftover = rand (0,1000);
[16:01:31] <needhelp> $ top = rand (0,1000);
[16:01:31] <needhelp> print ("<div style='background-color:red;position:absolute;top:".$top."px;left:".$left."px;width:500px;height:500px;'>ja</div>");
[16:01:32] <needhelp> ?>
[16:03:54] <needhelp> ;)
[16:04:18] <BillCriswell> needhelp: Yeah. I prefer the JS approach for that.
[16:05:17] <needhelp> how i can fix? wonder whether it is wise to use XY coordinates?
[16:06:20] <BillCriswell> I don't know what you need to fix.
[16:09:04] <needhelp> mh.
[16:14:06] <needhelp> How do I get the samples you sent me with my code?
[16:24:02] <NicholasC> I'm working with some very old jQuery Mobile I haven't written that's causing a problem: It had a login 'dialog', however when either the email or password field are touched, the virtual keyboard pops up, then immediately disappears again. Issue only seems to happen on phones, as it's not reproducible on an Asus Fonetab or an iPad 4. I haven't got an iPhone to test, sadly. Example exists at http://m.intermariswoonmatch.nl Anyone got a
[16:24:02] <NicholasC> clue?
[16:43:32] <NicholasC> I seem to've fixed my issue. The code was using 1.2.0 Alpha. Switching to 1.2.0 base solved it.
[16:55:16] <jParkton> shoky: are you around?
[16:55:47] <ThomasCrown> I would like to be able to incerment the var by adding +1 to it after each time it runs. currently I can get the current vaule but as it loops I would like for it to add 1
[16:55:50] <ThomasCrown> var g_date =$("input[id='#p_date_']").val();
[16:56:30] <il> How can I get jquery Datatable's Infinite scroll working?
[16:56:54] <ThomasCrown> so the id would be '#p_date_' on the second time around would be '#p_date_1' and so on and so forth.
[16:59:45] <jParkton> ThomasCrown: sounds like you need an array
[16:59:53] <jParkton> id=[];
[17:00:25] <shoky> jParkton: ya
[17:00:30] <ThomasCrown> jParkton: any help would be great on this, I have been at this for almost 2 days now.
[17:00:45] <jParkton> good luck?
[17:00:47] <jParkton> :)
[17:01:03] <jParkton> im too nubly to help otherwise I would
[17:01:43] <ThomasCrown> i have my scripts all writing out. basically what I am doing is gathering vaules and inserting them in a database.
[17:02:03] <jParkton> shoky: http://hastebin.com/ahomoharur it doesnt create amy div on button click am I doing it totally wrong?
[17:02:16] <jParkton> thats awesome!
[17:02:21] <ThomasCrown> so the first pass on the script gets the vaules, then the script sets the new vaules and it's suppose to get those, but it just gets the orginal values.
[17:02:27] <jParkton> I cant even manipulate the dom correctly :)
[17:03:37] <shoky> jParkton: why aren't you using jquery..
[17:03:55] <shoky> jParkton: and you should be using a css class for those styles, not applying them via js
[17:03:55] <jParkton> I am switching back and forth
[17:04:05] <jParkton> trying to do pure js then turn it into jquery
[17:04:13] <jParkton> I could lol
[17:04:23] <shoky> jParkton: "child" is not a DOM element, it's a collection of nodes
[17:04:23] <jParkton> Im just trying to get better at js
[17:04:30] <jParkton> oh
[17:04:40] <shoky> jParkton: also using "with" is frowned upon
[17:04:45] <jParkton> fml
[17:05:00] <jParkton> ok so do it in jquery and save me the ridicule :)
[17:05:13] <shoky> i'd do it in html and css
[17:05:37] <jParkton> ok
[17:05:49] <shoky> maybe one line of js to add a new div with some class, depending on what you want
[17:06:04] <jParkton> lemme design it in html/css and just manipulate the hands with jquery?
[17:06:08] <jParkton> i that a better way?
[17:06:48] <shoky> probably.. i donno what your plan is
[17:07:32] <jParkton> I want to make a clock
[17:07:37] <jParkton> with moving hands
[17:07:45] <jParkton> just something simple and nubly
[17:09:02] <shoky> anyways, your current code is throwing an error, check your console
[17:11:22] <jParkton> k

[17:20:40] <BillCriswell> Voyage: $('form[name=ibeSubmitByDest] input[name=destination]').val('Awesome')
[17:29:52] <Voyage> BillCriswell,  thanks
[17:30:23] <Voyage> no need for quotes in name? BillCriswell
[17:31:18] <BillCriswell> Voyage: Nope. Would only need to do that if you had some weird names that have characters that are significant to selectors.
[17:37:19] <george2> I'm trying to use a jQuery plugin called MixItUp to do some filtering, which it is supposed to be using jQuery's filter() for: https://mixitup.kunkalabs.com/docs/#method-filter but I can't get it to work as expected. When I console.log(index), it gives me some complex Object, not a number like the jQuery docs seem to say it should. http://bpaste.net/show/rdBlPApbN7I4aQDgU2qf/
[17:37:30] <george2> Can anyone help me figure out what's going on?
[17:39:52] <george2> The 'return index === 1' is pulled directly from the jQuery docs, and it doesn't seem to be working either - at least, the second "#mix" element is not shown.
[17:41:47] <Voyage> BillCriswell,  thanks.
[17:43:03] <__joshua___> $('#Container').mixItUp('filter', $myCollection, function(state){ looks nothing like jquey filter to me
[17:44:37] <BillCriswell> __joshua___: Agreeed.
[17:45:45] <george2> The filter command is the part that's supposed to use filter()
[17:45:53] <george2> From the docs: "The filter command most commonly takes the form of a CSS selector string targeting the desired elements to show. It may also take the form of a jQuery object, DOM element, or function. See jQuery’s .filter() documentation for more information."
[17:46:14] <__joshua___> ok, did you try a function?
[17:46:54] <george2> Yeah, did you see my paste? I tried function(index) that returned a boolean.
[17:47:23] <george2> $container.mixItUp('filter', function(index, element){
[17:47:24] <__joshua___> i see the paste.  what does it output?
[17:48:12] <george2> http://i.imgur.com/1Ru9A0h.png
[17:48:44] <george2> Not sure how to paste the output. Would it be easier if I tried making a fiddle?
[17:48:53] <__joshua___> much, mjuch easier.  then we can debug it
[17:49:05] <george2> k, just a minute then.
[17:58:16] <ThomasCrown> Can I please get someone to help I about to go freaking nuts over here
[17:58:43] <george2> __joshua___: How's this? http://jsfiddle.net/VF5jJ/
[18:01:41] <__joshua___> cheers
[18:02:04] <__joshua___> mixitup does not support a filter function: that function that is executing is the callback
[18:02:26] <george2> I thought the callback was the third argument
[18:02:35] <george2> The command is supposed to be able to be a function
[18:02:42] <george2> Or at least that's how I understood it
[18:02:52] <__joshua___> yeah, the docs say that
[18:03:07] <__joshua___> but if you supply a callback and the filter filter function, only the callback is run
[18:03:12] <george2> hrm :/
[18:03:13] <ThomasCrown> is the console logging command just console.log();?
[18:03:22] <george2> yeah
[18:03:47] <ThomasCrown> so if I wanted to see what a var is i would just enter it as
[18:03:54] <ThomasCrown> console.log(var);
[18:03:58] <BillCriswell> ThomasCrown: Yes.
[18:04:11] <ThomasCrown> and it should output in the console window correct?
[18:04:17] <ThomasCrown> when the script is ran?
[18:05:08] <BillCriswell> ThomasCrown: Yes, in the dev tools in the console panel.
[18:05:37] <__joshua___> what browser are you using? chrome?  https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/javascript-debugging
[18:05:54] <ThomasCrown> BillCriswell: and if it doesn't?
[18:05:57] <ThomasCrown> Chrome
[18:05:59] <jParkton> shoky: http://jsbin.com/yiwit/3/edit better?
[18:06:34] <BillCriswell> Taggnostr2: Then there's something else going wrong.
[18:07:12] <jParkton> I mean am I doin it right?
[18:07:42] <ThomasCrown> if I wanted to check this var i should just be adding it into the js correct?
[18:07:44] <ThomasCrown> console.log(g_time);
[18:07:54] <ThomasCrown> and that should output the var currect?
[18:07:56] <Jattenalle> quick question guys, easy way to detect if a function is bound to the click event or not? i need it for some buttons that should only have click events added if there's no click events bound already
[18:08:10] <BillCriswell> ThomasCrown: Yes. If it's in a function you have to make sure you're calling the function.
[18:08:51] <BillCriswell> george2: Set on using this plugin?
[18:09:20] <george2> BillCriswell: well, not if it doesn't work. Do you know of another like it?
[18:09:37] <george2> I was going to clean up my fiddle and submit an issue, then look for something else.
[18:09:54] <BillCriswell> george2: Are you just trying to filter some items based on the text content of them?
[18:10:39] <george2> BillCriswell: Well, I'd like to have sorting, filtering, and some kind of fancy animation thing.
[18:10:56] <george2> All of which MixItUp claimed to be able to do.
[18:12:28] <ThomasCrown> BillCriswell: So if I am getting a var like this: "var g_date =$('#p_date_').val();" Then right below it I should be able to put in "console.log(g_time);" and it should output it right?
[18:12:48] <BillCriswell> ThomasCrown: Yes.
[18:12:49] <ThomasCrown> minus the outside ""
[18:12:59] <xniz> hmmm... lets say i use scrolltop to go to the top of the page... is there a way I can scroll back down to the position the page was at before I scrolled to the top?
[18:13:06] <BillCriswell> ThomasCrown: Make sure you spelled "script" right, and if you have a type attribute make sure "text/javascript" is spelled right.
[18:13:41] <ThomasCrown> freaking a.... Yea all my code is running fine, but the console isn't working. it would help for me to 'debug' my issue
[18:13:57] <shoky> george2: http://jsfiddle.net/VF5jJ/4/
[18:14:10] <ThomasCrown> <script type="text/javascript">
[18:15:00] <BillCriswell> ThomasCrown: Paste your source at pastie.org or something.
[18:15:44] <george2> shoky: Nice! I don't understand any of that, but it works. :)
[18:15:50] <george2> Thanks
[18:16:04] <shoky> george2: their example shows passing a jquery object as a filter. so that's what i'm doing
[18:16:43] <ThomasCrown> http://pastie.org/private/r7otwdpslemvf9ubjota
[18:17:33] <george2> shoky: Out of curiosity, why indexOf instead of contains?
[18:17:33] <BillCriswell> ThomasCrown: You need to put it in a document ready.
[18:17:44] <BillCriswell> george2: cheaper.
[18:17:52] <george2> huh, ok.
[18:18:24] <shoky> george2: contains only works on firefox i think
[18:18:30] <shoky> string.contains  that is
[18:18:45] <george2> ah, that would have given me a headache later.
[18:18:50] <BillCriswell> Oh, I was thinking you were using :contains
[18:18:53] <shoky> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/contains
[18:18:53] <ThomasCrown> BillCriswell: not sure what you mean by document ready
[18:18:56] <BillCriswell> Should have looked.
[18:19:11] <BillCriswell> ThomasCrown: $(function(){ .... Your Code });
[18:19:30] <BillCriswell> ThomasCrown: Basically, that event never gets attached because there's no elements to attach it to at the time it runs.
[18:21:09] <BillCriswell> shoky: Do you find it weird you can't do $('.item').data('foo', function(){}); ?
[18:21:34] <shoky> i find it unfortunate, not weird ;p
[18:21:48] <BillCriswell> shoky: It seems inconsistent.
[18:22:10] <shoky> exactly. jquery's API being inconsistent is a given fact. not weird ;p
[18:22:31] <george2> Is there some way to lowercase a string, or use indexOf case insensitively?
[18:22:31] <ThomasCrown> BillCriswell: I added it like you suggested and it still doesn't work. :(
[18:22:41] <shoky> george2: yes.
[18:22:52] <george2> how? :p
[18:22:53] <ThomasCrown> I put it into it own anny. function and still no console.
[18:23:01] <shoky> you can find out yourself
[18:23:09] <shoky> if you can't, go do something else.
[18:23:09] <BillCriswell> ThomasCrown: Did you put it into a document ready though?
[18:23:30] <george2> wooow :)
[18:23:41] <Starcraftmazter> does hover() do both on and out?
[18:24:27] <ThomasCrown> BillCriswell: Yep : "// Shorthand for $( document ).ready()
[18:24:27] <ThomasCrown> $(function() {
[18:24:27] <ThomasCrown>     console.log( "ready!" );
[18:24:27] <ThomasCrown> });"
[18:24:53] <BillCriswell> ThomasCrown: Are you sure you have jQuery loded properly?
[18:25:33] <ThomasCrown> BillCriswell: I believe so, I am calling it from Googles CDN
[18:26:12] <BillCriswell> ThomasCrown: Do you have an open head and html tag and everything.
[18:26:36] <BillCriswell> ThomasCrown: Try to load mimic it at jsfiddle.net
[18:26:53] <ThomasCrown> Yep, it's all in the code that i pasted to you.
[18:28:21] <ThomasCrown> BillCriswell: it won't run it.
[18:28:33] <ThomasCrown> it will build the first parts, but then it won't actually do the action.
[18:28:46] <BillCriswell> ThomasCrown: I don't see an opening html and head that I see in the code you gave me.
[18:29:15] <xniz> http://hastebin.com/onexepakeb.avrasm can someone tell me why it is saying img.src is undefined after it is loaded.
[18:29:41] <ThomasCrown> BillCriswell: It is in my code, I have the html and the head, I just wanted to omit the title when I posted the code.
[18:30:11] <BillCriswell> Ok, well people do this a million times a day so you must be doing something weird.
[18:30:38] <ThomasCrown> haha I suppose.
[18:31:39] <ThomasCrown> does it matter that it's a .html file?
[18:31:44] <BillCriswell> No.
[18:32:12] <BillCriswell> ThomasCrown: What version of jQuery are you using?
[18:32:37] <ThomasCrown> 1.4.4
[18:32:48] <ThomasCrown> from google CDN
[18:32:50] <BillCriswell> Oh... no idea then.
[18:33:27] <ThomasCrown> well here's to another day or two of banging my head on trying to sovle my larger issue then.
[18:33:31] <ThomasCrown> thanks for the help!
[18:33:43] <BillCriswell> No problem.
[18:33:44] <shoky> pastebin your full source..
[18:33:49] <ThomasCrown> another other help would be much appri.
[18:34:41] <BillCriswell> http://jsbin.com/pesihuso/1/edit?js,output Wonder what the downsides are to this approach haha.
[18:37:32] <BillCriswell> Man, it's hot.
[18:40:35] <ThomasCrown> BillCriswell: I found the issue!!
[18:41:04] <BillCriswell> What was it?
[18:41:11] <ThomasCrown> BillCriswell: If you have firebug installed, then it will output to the firebug console window and not the Chrome window.
[18:41:35] <BillCriswell> Ah.
[18:41:40] <ThomasCrown> I disabled firebug and then reloaded the page, and I got the output in the Chrome console window.
[18:42:13] <ThomasCrown> I was about to go pound my head on the wall when you told me that millions of people did this a day and that I was the only one with an issue.
[18:42:14] <ThomasCrown> haha
[18:44:08] <BillCriswell> Haha.
[18:44:53] <ThomasCrown> now I just have to figure out how to incrament a string like "g_date_" + 1 so then it reads "g_date_1" and the next round would be "g_date_2" and etc...
[18:44:58] <ThomasCrown> any help in that dept?
[18:46:00] <BillCriswell> Ideally you wouldn't need to do that but if your hands are tied you could use replace.
[18:46:29] <ThomasCrown> what would be the best way of doing that?
[18:46:32] <ThomasCrown> ideally?
[18:47:19] <BillCriswell> You could have the name as an array, or even an attribute like data-date-number="2"
[18:47:27] <BillCriswell> It really depends what you're trying to do.
[18:48:07] <ThomasCrown> everytime a new div with two feilds are added I want to be able to post those into mysql
[18:49:04] <ThomasCrown> so if a user clicks on 'add new event time' then they can put in there the date and time, and then they can add another one and it stays on the same page.
[18:49:17] <ThomasCrown> but I need to get those vaules and input them into mysql.
[18:49:35] <BillCriswell> ThomasCrown: So do you have fields in your table like g_date_213 ?
[18:49:39] <ThomasCrown> the script works for the first vaule, but then any vaule created after that it doesn't.
[18:50:10] <ThomasCrown> the feilds in my database are: id, event_id, date, time
[18:50:11] <BillCriswell> 'name_foo_22'.replace(/\d+$/, function(n){ return +n + 1 }); would return name_foo_23, so you could use that.
[18:50:52] <ThomasCrown> sweet, let me try that.
[19:15:42] <RonWhoCares> What would you use for a fancy select with the ability to type while it searches
[19:20:37] <clueful> I'd like to build a page, where I can list a bunch of items, and when I click on an X next to an item it will be deleted (by sending an ajax post query)
[19:21:19] <clueful> are there any good patterns for doing so, like does it make sense to have each item and x in a separate form?
[19:38:15] <AndChat74900> Hi all, i need some help. I want to know the english name for something i can't describe by words. If you visit the website data.weetmeer.nl and scroll down to the table and look at the most right column you will see the horizontal lines with small vertical lines and colored squares in it... Can you tell me what its called in english ? Better would be some kind of script that can make these
[19:45:44] <dondrapor> Hi guys

[20:46:28] <rburton-> Anyone know of an 'intelligent' autocomplete in which parts of the 'phrase' can be typed in and the rest be autocompleted. e.g., Friends who work at <word> in <city>
[20:47:52] <__joshua___> google
[20:49:29] <LoneStar99> rburton-: the best way is to query a database using ajax and onkeyup have it query database
[20:49:29] <rburton-> um
[20:49:33] <rburton-> I've been there before
[20:52:16] <rburton-> I guess basically a smart auto complete in which there's a list of 'starting points' and upon tabbing you'll have the user enter in something and if they start typing the next 'segment' they can auto complete. Make sense/
[20:53:37] <LoneStar99> kinda like "tags"  ?
[20:54:25] <rburton-> partly, imagine I want to take the phrase of say
[20:54:40] <rburton-> Friends who work at <company> and lives in <city>
[20:54:53] <rburton-> so imagine that the first part could be different starting points
[20:55:06] <rburton-> e.g.,"Friends who work at" or "Friends who live in"
[20:55:43] <rburton-> upon typing that, the user then could free type stuff and if they start to type another 'segment' it'll then auto complete. e.g., "and lives in"
[20:55:51] <rburton-> so auto complete parts of the query
[20:56:40] <rburton-> sort of how Facebook graph does
[20:57:17] <LoneStar99> rburton-: facebook graph search on the top right?
[20:57:21] <rburton-> yes
[20:57:30] <rburton-> They have it broken down into what I call segments
[20:58:04] <rburton-> e.g., People I may know who live in New York, New York and work at Google
[20:58:18] <rburton-> When you start typing, they auto complete parts of the search
[20:58:32] <craphter> Hey guys, I'm having a really simple problem, I cant get jquery to work. I have it in the same folder as my HTML, and I've typed <script src="jquery.js">, but the code simply doesn't run! Any ideas?
[20:58:59] <LoneStar99> rburton-:  ok let me take a look
[20:59:14] <rburton-> Most autocomplete boxes just do a full phase and stop after that.
[20:59:54] <rburton-> The only thought I have is maybe I could generate on the server 'possible' phrases
[21:01:02] <craphter> Am I invisible or did I login correctly?
[21:01:15] <LoneStar99> rburton-: yeah i was thinking the same, some predefined phrases, or let me think...
[21:01:38] <rburton-> I think it would be a simple solution
[21:13:18] <LoneStar99> rburton-: yeah,  think so simplest solution for now.... predefined phrases that populate depending on query...
[21:13:53] <rburton-> then when the user types say "Friends in New York" I can then generate a list of possible endings e.g., "Friends in New York who work at "
[21:14:04] <rburton-> or "Friends in New York who know "
[21:16:36] <rburton-> wonder what would be a good autocomplete widget to use now time to do research
[21:18:17] <rburton-> http://complete-ly.appspot.com/examples/booking.html
[21:26:59] <LoneStar99> rburton-: yeah seems like a cool auto suggest
[21:27:19] <rburton-> sort of a problem since its really designed for single words

[22:45:50] <whoback> Can someone take a look a this and help me figure out why I'm getting NaN for my CTR calc?
[22:45:54] <whoback> http://jsbin.com/bijanara/1/edit?html,js,output
[22:46:29] <whoback> appreciate any help!
[22:49:09] <Braad> whoback: why aren't you passing anything to analytics()?
[22:50:14] <whoback> I want to pass count and hcount - I could have this setup the wrong way
[22:51:14] <whoback> I really just want to run the analytics function anytime a link is hovered or clicked on
[22:52:48] <Braad> whoback: you definitely should be passing two arguments to analytics
[22:53:11] <Braad> whoback: and you're also setting up a potential divide by 0 situation with (count / hcount).toString();
[22:54:08] <whoback> right I understand the divide by zero issue. can you suggest a better way to set this up?
[22:54:22] <whoback> its really just a simple analytics thing I'm attempting
[22:54:37] <whoback> link hovers, clicks, and calc of CTR
[22:55:59] <Braad> just add the arguments to analytics like this: analytics(count, hcount);
[22:56:02] <Braad> whoback: and it works
[22:56:13] <whoback> ill try
[22:56:56] <whoback> braad thanks! you're right
[22:57:20] <Braad> whoback: no problem. it's a neat idea.
[23:14:57] <Zelpa> Hey, I'm trying to run something when I click a button, but I'd like to run it outside of the button. How would I do that?
[23:21:37] <Cork> Zelpa: outside??
[23:22:06] <Zelpa> Not really sure how to describe it, but I'd like to apply the theme by pressing the button
[23:22:19] <Zelpa> But I don't want that part inside of the button
[23:22:29] <Cork> Zelpa: js isn't inside html
[23:22:46] <Cork> unless you add it as attribute strings on the actual element (shouldn't do that)
[23:23:22] <Zelpa> You know your JSFiddle from last night?
[23:23:33] <Cork> sure
[23:23:44] <Zelpa> How would you go about saving the current theme?
[23:23:50] <Zelpa> Into localstorage or a cookie
[23:24:10] <Cork> Zelpa: its very light data, so either would work
[23:24:24] <Cork> you could add it as a query to the url too
[23:25:16] <Zelpa> I want to save $('body').removeClass(themes).addClass($(this).data('theme')); correct?
[23:25:20] <Zelpa> And then get that when the page loads
[23:25:43] <Cork> Zelpa: cookie, localstorage or a query argument
[23:25:47] <Cork> all would work
[23:25:56] <Cork> pick your poison :)
[23:26:27] <Zelpa> I guess a cookie would be the best
[23:28:00] <Zelpa> :/ apparently Jquery doens't have cookies and you need a plugin
[23:28:06] <Cork> no
[23:28:16] <Cork> document.cookies
[23:28:21] <Cork> no need for a plugin
[23:28:44] <Cork> it is a bit clonky  to handle manually so you might want one, but you don't need it
[23:29:10] <Cork> document.cookies = "theme=" + data('theme')
[23:31:01] <Zelpa> Would localstorage be easier maybe?
[23:31:10] <Cork> a little
[23:31:44] <Cork> localstorage.setItem('theme', data('theme'))
[23:31:56] <Zelpa> and just put that inside the theme click button?
[23:32:00] <Cork> ya
[23:32:09] <Cork> but do if(localStorage) {} around it
[23:32:12] <Zelpa> Now how do I get that when the page loads?
[23:32:20] <Cork> what do you think?
[23:32:39] <Zelpa> getItem?
[23:32:44] <Cork> exactly :)
[23:32:59] <Cork> btw it's localStorage not localstorage
[23:33:40] <Zelpa> Wha's the if(localstorage) part for?
[23:34:03] <Cork> Zelpa: so your script doesn't break if localStorage doesn't exist
[23:35:58] <Zelpa> I just selected the light theme and checked the localstorage
[23:36:00] <Zelpa> Nothing was set
[23:39:16] <Cork> Zelpa: http://jsfiddle.net/sJaB9/
[23:43:02] <Zelpa> Alright, but how do I store the theme?
[23:43:30] <Zelpa> data('theme') is what i need to store right?
[23:48:34] <Zelpa> Cork: How do I store the theme though? pretty sure it's data('theme') right?
[23:48:44] <Cork> ya
[23:49:03] <Cork> Zelpa: the fiddle i gave you should answer that question
[23:50:32] <Zelpa> but in that you're manually setting the value to light
[23:50:47] <Cork> Zelpa: uh, ya sure so what?
[23:51:57] <Zelpa> So what would I set the localstorage to?
[23:52:05] <Zelpa> I want it to set to whatever button you pressed
[23:52:20] <Zelpa> LIke light or dark
[23:52:31] <Cork> Zelpa: seriously... try to add what you know together
[23:52:48] <Cork> it should be fairly obvious
[23:52:55] <Zelpa> You mean putting the localstorage inside of the light and dark button?
[23:53:08] <Zelpa> ('#light').click
[23:54:11] <Cork> Zelpa: if you can't figure that one out you should prob read a tutorial for basic javascript
