[00:11:12] <walabe> anyone used this before? https://github.com/creativeaura/threesixty-slider
[00:19:44] <walabe> why does this work for everyone else, but not me??? http://www.thepetedesign.com/demos/interactive_bg_demo.html i'm on latest chrome
[00:20:28] <arc_> extension or user script
[00:20:30] <arthurvr> walabe: try in an incognito window. Browser extensions are known to mess with this kind of stuff.
[00:20:46] <arc_> kuateee is a spammer
[00:21:12] <walabe> nope doesn't work on icognito
[00:21:35] <arthurvr> chrome revision? (version)
[00:22:32] <arthurvr> does it work in opera?
[00:22:43] <arthurvr> arc_: yep
[00:22:53] <walabe> says it's up to date Version 43.0.2357.130 m
[00:23:01] <walabe> doesn't work on my home PC as well, I'm on a laptop now
[00:23:40] <arthurvr> works for me.
[00:23:58] <arthurvr> strange
[00:24:05] <walabe> Yes that's the thing it works for everyone else
[00:24:18] <arthurvr> probably some kind of setting or whatever else on your computer then
[00:24:22] <walabe> I've had issues like this in the past, with odd things here and there using js or javascript
[00:24:23] <arc_> are you on windows xp or something
[00:24:37] <arthurvr> arc_: lol
[00:24:37] <walabe> no windows 8,1 doesn't work on my home computer either windows 7
[00:26:02] <arc_> does anything come up in the console
[00:28:30] <walabe> yes failed to load something, but doesn't look relevant. "adn,fushionads.net
[00:32:28] <walabe> wtf it's not working when browsing as "guest" either??
[00:32:39] <walabe> I don't see how this is possible
[00:32:58] <Cork> walabe: try disabling your extensions
[00:33:09] <Cork> they can be enabled in incognito mode
[00:33:45] <walabe> they are cork still not working
[00:34:40] <walabe> somehow its not working on both pc and laptop 2 different machines, and not working when extensions disabled, not working when browsing in guest with nothing enabled
[00:36:20] <phiz> works for me on osx chrome
[00:36:45] <phiz> kinda makes me dizzy too
[00:37:37] <arc_> this would be a lot better with a parallax effect
[00:38:38] <walabe> can you check if it works on my site?? the stars in the header. http://chronox.netai.net/
[00:38:49] <arup_r> Hi.. I found this http://jsfiddle.net/gydL0epa/ which suits with my need. What I need extra is .. Once someone will select the date, the next 3 dates will be selected automatically .. how to achieve so ?
[00:43:45] <walabe> can anyone please check? if the stars effect works on my site?? http://chronox.netai.net/
[00:49:24] <arc_> yes
[01:17:45] <Bjerre> hello people
[01:18:11] <Bjerre> ban kuateee for spamming pornsites
[01:18:56] <Cork> Bjerre: report it to #freenode
[01:19:05] <Bjerre> aight will do
[01:19:05] <Cork> there is usually no ops around here
[01:23:37] <Bjerre> btw Cork I there' something really strange going on with my project. It won't show on jsfiddle but when I console.log the keyCodes in the browser of my SPA it first starts with 1 on keyCode 40. Then it goes to 3 the next time I click. 11, then 23... it makes the browser having huge lags... any idea on how to prevent it even if it isn't happening in the http://jsfiddle.net/Bjerre/dr2e2ogt/2/  ?
[01:23:56] <Bjerre> ops, forgot to remove I" :P
[01:24:32] <Cork> Bjerre: unless you're answering a question i've asked please don't state the question directly to me
[01:24:42] <Cork> ask the channel and ppl will try to answer if they have time
[01:24:53] <Bjerre> Sorry Cork I thought it was you I spoke with yesterday
[01:25:01] <Bjerre> regarding the buffer usage
[01:25:10] <Cork> it was, but that doesn't mean every question you have after that should be directed to me
[01:46:40] <kk_drop> I have this form: http://jsfiddle.net/g8avznuo/1/
[01:48:46] <kk_drop> I check if fields are filled by chrome autofill and if they are, enable button instantly. but it does not work in chrome, only in firefox
[01:48:54] <Kartagis> http://jsfiddle.net/kartagis/g8avznuo/2/
[01:49:01] <Kartagis> kk_drop, ^
[01:50:02] <Cork> kk_drop: use input not keyup and the rest
[01:50:48] <kk_drop> Kartagis, the probem is different - jsfiddle does not autofills this form - just on your action. if you'd have it filled just after page is loaded (without any interaction from user) you could see that button is still disabled
[01:51:08] <Cork> kk_drop: http://jsfiddle.net/g8avznuo/3/
[01:51:32] <Cork> kk_drop: you have to trigger the event on page load
[01:51:44] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/g8avznuo/4/
[01:52:12] <kk_drop> I am
[01:52:35] <Cork> /4/ should do all you're asking for
[01:52:43] <kk_drop> ok I will check
[01:55:11] <kk_drop> still nothing
[01:55:22] <Cork> what exactly isn't working?
[01:55:35] <kk_drop> when page loads, I have filled form, but button is disabled
[01:55:49] <Cork> are you running the code exactly as it is in the fiddle?
[01:55:57] <Cork> or do you have the needed .ready wrapper?
[01:56:40] <kk_drop> exactly. I'll try to create this on some custom html page
[01:57:09] <Cork> kk_drop: make sure you have $(function() {}) or $(document).ready(function() {}) around the code
[02:10:18] <JBzh> good morning
[02:11:52] <parveen> i have defined a variable global and its array  . Inside by function i splice the that global  array.  Now i want to reassign the array same values which i was in globally
[02:12:00] <parveen> how to reassign the same values
[02:12:56] <Cork> parveen: could you create a jsfiddle?
[02:13:05] <Cork> cause the request doesn't really make sense
[02:13:12] <parveen> okay
[02:16:20] <noob> Hey Guys :)
[02:19:13] <kk_drop> Cork, I have. On load it does not detect that password is filled
[02:19:15] <parveen> Cork  https://jsfiddle.net/531ckftq/
[02:19:41] <parveen> first time on console it will show all values bt not next time
[02:20:29] <Cork> parveen: so either create a default_colors array
[02:20:41] <Cork> or create a local copy of the array (in the testagain function)
[02:21:03] <parveen> no other way to get global or default values of array
[02:21:05] <parveen> ?
[02:21:38] <Cork> parveen: your changing the default value
[02:21:49] <parveen> hmmm
[02:21:56] <Cork> so you are getting the global value and that is an empty array
[02:22:10] <Cork> parveen: https://jsfiddle.net/531ckftq/1/
[02:22:25] <Cork> parveen: if you could share a bit more of the context i might be able to give you a better answer
[02:23:23] <parveen> Cork , Thanks , i got your point , I need to create local copy otherwise it will not work
[02:23:48] <Cork> parveen: it will work, it will just change the global variable
[02:24:35] <parveen> :) yes
[02:25:13] <Cork> parveen: note .slice is important
[02:25:36] <kk_drop> weird thing is, that when I add timeout function after page load it can read from name, but not from pass field.
[02:25:39] <Cork> if you just do var levent_colors = event_colors, lvent_colors will just point to the array event_colors point to
[02:25:46] <Cork> and won't create a unique copy
[02:25:50] <Bjerre> Found a way to check what scene I'm on with the SPA but not sure on how to add the else http://jsfiddle.net/Bjerre/dr2e2ogt/3/  Anyone got any idea?
[02:31:40] <Bjerre> forgot to add that I want the click to be disabled on the 'main' scene
[02:34:18] <Cork> Bjerre: you got to start to include more context in the fiddles
[02:34:33] <Cork> you could basically skip then with how little info is in them
[02:34:37] <Cork> *them*
[02:37:58] <Bjerre> Cork: the reason is because the editor uses different calls which has nothing to do with regular javascript or jquery. I'm only asking this because I believe it is quite easy for someone who's well aware of on how to get string value and if the string value is 'main' then disable the click
[02:38:35] <Bjerre> It will most likely be the last question regarding this editor
[02:38:39] <Bjerre> since I'm never gonna use it again
[02:40:00] <Bjerre> I know that a jsfiddle which has no viewable elements is a bad call and I'm sorry for that but there is no way for me to implement it
[02:58:26] <dichtbringer> hi everyone, i need some quick help please
[02:59:05] <dichtbringer> $('#Calendarentrywrapper').load('<cms:show k_page_link />',function(){var $ht=$('#Calendarentry').delay(1200).height(); alert($ht);
[02:59:38] <Cork> dichtbringer: .desly only affect animations
[02:59:43] <Cork> 'delay
[03:00:03] <dichtbringer> ah, i thougt as much
[03:00:03] <Cork> so .height won't wait for 1.2 seconds, and it won't delay the alert
[03:00:08] <Cork> use setTimeout
[03:00:17] <dichtbringer> ah, ok
[03:00:34] <dichtbringer> but i was under the impression that load callback function should wait til everything, including images is loaded, no?
[03:00:42] <Cork> no
[03:00:52] <Cork> when you use load to fetch content
[03:01:04] <Cork> the callback is fired as soon as the content has been injected into the page
[03:01:15] <Cork> external resources isn't included in that delay
[03:01:26] <dichtbringer> ah... is there a way to make it wait for those?
[03:01:32] <Cork> no
[03:01:40] <dichtbringer> because even with settimeout, those 1.2 sec are an arbitrary value and won't always be enough
[03:01:48] <Shebbi> Hi Cork
[03:02:00] <Cork> ya, you would have to bind a load event on each img in the fragment
[03:02:15] <dichtbringer> it's only ever 1 image
[03:02:18] <Cork> Shebbi: o/
[03:02:35] <Cork> dichtbringer: so add a onload="notify()" in the img tag
[03:02:38] <Shebbi> Cork: What does o/ mean?
[03:02:47] <Cork> o <-- head / <-- arm
[03:03:15] <Shebbi> Cork: Where's the finger? :-)
[03:03:31] <Shebbi> Cork: Joking
[03:03:39] <Cork> i usually don't give ppl the finger out of nowhere <_<
[03:04:36] <Shebbi> Cork: has coldhead retired?
[03:04:46] <dichtbringer> the notify won't do (i don't need alert $ht, i need another div to be set to $ht (i just used alert for test purposes)
[03:04:49] <dichtbringer> so the notify bit won't help^^
[03:04:56] <Cork> its summer, he is most likely taking it easy on a beach :)
[03:05:21] <Cork> dichtbringer: ya, so define the function globally
[03:05:28] <dichtbringer> the set to height function already works, but i need to make sure it only grabs the height after evrything, including images has been loaded
[03:05:31] <Cork> dichtbringer: and have that function trigger a $.Callback
[03:05:43] <Shebbi> Cork: You guys live in the same area? I'm wondering where summer is in your neck of the woods.
[03:05:49] <Cork> and have what ever cares about it add it self as a callback to that list
[03:06:02] <Cork> Shebbi: i have no clue what country he lives in
[03:06:07] <Cork> i normally don't care
[03:06:48] <Shebbi> Cork: Good chat.
[03:25:27] <d4rth_s1d10us> hi, any admins? mentors?
[03:25:32] <d4rth_s1d10us> i am new here
[03:29:11] <d4rth_s1d10us> anyone?
[03:29:13] <xhoy> d4rth_s1d10us: welcom :)
[03:29:14] <d4rth_s1d10us> please?
[03:29:17] <xhoy> you should just ask a question
[03:29:23] <d4rth_s1d10us> ok
[03:29:25] <xhoy> because i have no clue what you are looking for
[03:29:38] <d4rth_s1d10us> i recently read "Javascript: the good parts"
[03:29:53] <xhoy> ok
[03:29:56] <d4rth_s1d10us> i need to apply he concepts, so today it is the first time
[03:30:02] <d4rth_s1d10us> the*
[03:30:07] <xhoy> http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/javascript
[03:30:10] <xhoy> do that course
[03:30:21] <xhoy> when you know how it works you can do that in 3 hours
[03:30:31] <d4rth_s1d10us> cool
[03:30:37] <xhoy> the flow this course: http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/jquery
[03:30:41] <d4rth_s1d10us> and exactly how to start cntributing?
[03:30:51] <xhoy> to jquery?
[03:31:41] <d4rth_s1d10us> yes
[03:31:47] <xhoy> do those coureses
[03:31:55] <d4rth_s1d10us> javascript is done
[03:32:01] <d4rth_s1d10us> jquery is 21%
[03:32:12] <d4rth_s1d10us> i will complete that first :)
[03:32:27] <xhoy> and then take a look at https://github.com/jquery/jquery
[03:32:30] <xhoy> but to be honist
[03:32:37] <xhoy> i think that would be rather hard
[03:32:55] <d4rth_s1d10us> but?
[03:32:57] <xhoy> jquery is quite complex so when you just started to learn jquery i would suggest first using javascript
[03:33:08] <d4rth_s1d10us> ok
[03:33:11] <xhoy> i think i can write 'nice' javascript
[03:33:17] <xhoy> and i have done so for serveral years
[03:33:32] <xhoy> but looking at the jquery source it still takes me some time to understand it
[03:33:33] <xhoy> :)
[03:33:47] <xhoy> d4rth_s1d10us: my suggestion would be learn more different programming langues
[03:33:54] <xhoy> start using them in projects you like
[03:34:11] <xhoy> dow, what you could do
[03:34:26] <xhoy> is start wit updating documentation on jquery (or any other OOS project)
[03:34:45] <d4rth_s1d10us> i am familiar with html/css/ javascript/ php/ python/ java
[03:34:48] <xhoy> because when you follow the jquery docs and as a "new" user you noticed things that other users would never ever see
[03:34:51] <d4rth_s1d10us> not a pro
[03:34:53] <xhoy> d4rth_s1d10us: AAAAAAh so you can code?
[03:34:57] <d4rth_s1d10us> but i can code
[03:35:01] <xhoy> nice
[03:35:13] <d4rth_s1d10us> i am new here
[03:35:16] <xhoy> i would start with folling de docs and using the features
[03:35:21] <d4rth_s1d10us> as in for open source contribution
[03:35:22] <xhoy> and update some docs or guides
[03:35:30] <xhoy> and if you find someting the contribute
[03:35:33] <xhoy> commit it to github
[03:36:10] <d4rth_s1d10us> cool
[03:36:14] <xhoy> https://contribute.jquery.org/ <<<
[03:36:16] <d4rth_s1d10us> i will start off
[03:36:22] <xhoy> and maby look at the bug tracker
[03:36:27] <xhoy> and find a bug you think you could solv
[03:36:28] <xhoy> e
[03:36:30] <d4rth_s1d10us> you have been very supportive
[03:36:34] <xhoy> np
[03:36:35] <d4rth_s1d10us> thank you :)
[03:36:42] <xhoy> ill be going on vaction tomorow for 4 weeks
[03:36:58] <xhoy> but the most important thing (with ever oos) the main dev's are verry verry bussy
[03:37:13] <xhoy> nobody likes to be rude or anything so just keep trying
[03:37:26] <d4rth_s1d10us> sure
[03:37:36] <xhoy> and when you try hard enough and give there commends a "tought" and atleast try to understand it it will work out :)
[03:37:38] <d4rth_s1d10us> that is how i will learn
[03:37:47] <xhoy> and there are lots of nice OOS projects (big and small)
[03:38:33] <xhoy> so try to get feedback on your bugfixes/pull requests and ask here of you dont know what you should do with the comments or dont undrestand them
[03:38:54] <d4rth_s1d10us> so first
[03:39:03] <d4rth_s1d10us> i plunge right into the documentation
[03:39:24] <xhoy> :)
[03:40:06] <xhoy> documentation is a weak spot on almost any OOS
[03:40:12] <xhoy> OSS btw
[03:45:36] <eddq> Hi, i could do with help with something I believe to be basic but can't get the syntax right. I am removing all select options apart from the first from an element like this '$('#key-stages option:gt(0)').remove();' If I assign #key-stages to a variable eg. $element = $('#key-stages'); How can I use the previous command? I've tried $($element + 'option:gt(0)').remove(); but I get an object error....
[03:47:15] <m1su> $element.find('option:gt(0)').remove() should do the trick
[03:49:52] <eddq> excellent cheers
[04:02:01] <elmcrest> hey everyone. Does anybody know a (table-) filter that supports "AND" or "OR" to match multiple terms?
[04:02:15] <elmcrest> or could I do this myself somehow easily? :)
[04:02:50] <mdev> you'd probably have to google
[04:03:16] <mdev> I did the and or thing recently with datatables however I used php to do it just generated a long if elseif php code then used eval :x
[04:03:25] <mdev> didn't work like I wanted, or did but not example
[04:03:36] <mdev> because OR's were matching when not intended
[04:03:44] <mdev> or were intended idk, it's hard to explain
[04:04:18] <elmcrest> hmm ok :)
[04:04:27] <mdev> heh
[04:04:46] <elmcrest> of course I started my journey with google ... but it seems this is some uncommon requirement
[04:04:53] <mdev> you probably could eval javascript if worse comes to worse
[04:05:04] <mdev> and just build a if, elseif etc...type thing
[04:05:14] <elmcrest> ok
[04:05:49] <mdev> https://datatables.net/examples/api/multi_filter_select.html
[04:06:16] <mdev> that looks better
[04:06:29] <mdev> another https://jquery-datatables-column-filter.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/customFilters.html
[04:06:38] <mdev> datatables is jquery based so
[04:15:46] <Enissay> Hi guys, I'm trying to insert some rows but things arent working as expected... please check this snippet and tell me what I'm missing: http://pastebin.com/4Apm3icy
[04:17:57] <Cyclohexane> How do I select all dropdowns where a given value is selected?
[04:18:15] <AcidRain2012> $(this).val()
[04:22:29] <Cyclohexane> AcidRain2012: that just lists everything?
[04:22:46] <AcidRain2012> hmmm... it doesnt for me. for me it only lists the selected value
[04:24:18] <AcidRain2012> http://pastebin.com/3Fua21Kd
[04:33:06] <Cyclohexane> AcidRain2012: nah I mean all dropdowns on the page, so if you change one it finds all the others with the same value
[04:33:43] <AcidRain2012> give it a name then
[04:33:58] <AcidRain2012> $("select[name=thisOne]").change
[04:34:33] <AcidRain2012> if you mean you wish to iterate through all of them. just find a way to do that ;p
[04:41:00] <rfc19_> Hello, I've got a 'close' button on one of my popout divs that has a form inside it. Every time I click 'close' the form tries to submit, no matter what I do - why is this?
[04:42:51] <kokut> Hi, how can i add an element outside the element ? like encircle my selector in  <div></div> or something.. ?
[04:44:26] <kokut> nvm
[04:46:22] <fionn_> hey guys, want to place some stuff before a tag, is there a suitable jquery for this?
[04:47:13] <mdev> yes sir
[04:47:27] <mdev> jquery is the dom manipulator :)
[04:49:40] <fionn_> tried to use #main->preprend()
[04:49:51] <fionn_> but nothing was prepended
[04:50:58] <mdev> http://api.jquery.com/insertafter/
[04:51:03] <kokut> Hello, i need to select all the text after each input (to wrap them in) http://jsfiddle.net/euronhLw/ how can i do that?
[04:51:04] <mdev> http://api.jquery.com/after/
[04:51:04] <tumulte> hello
[04:51:10] <mdev> try one of those
[04:51:22] <mdev> $('#lst3').before('<li id="lst21"> list item three</li>');
[04:51:24] <mdev> or that
[04:51:38] <mdev> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8553052/how-to-append-an-element-between-two-elements
[04:51:42] <mdev> credit to that
[04:51:56] <fionn_> thanks! will look through them
[04:53:34] <Enissay> So, no one to unblock me guyz, i've been stuck here since yesterday :<
[04:54:11] <fionn_> hmm i tried both of these and still nothing
[04:59:18] <kokut> nvm fixed it
[05:04:03] <fionn_> using the insert() or insertAfter()  makes my other  js not work either
[05:04:39] <fionn_> http://laravel.io/bin/row0L
[05:04:43] <fionn_> here's my script
[05:07:40] <TeddyMurray> fionn_, typo in insertAfter
[05:07:43] <TeddyMurray> you have inserAfter
[05:08:03] <fionn_> ahh i do!
[05:08:08] <TeddyMurray> =]
[05:08:15] <fionn_> been messing with it since then with the right spelling though :P
[05:08:22] <fionn_> my other js is not broken so that was the typo
[05:08:33] <fionn_> but its still not putting in the div
[05:08:48] <TeddyMurray> looking
[05:10:02] <TeddyMurray> can you post the html?
[05:10:44] <fionn_> yeah gimme a sec
[05:10:45] <TeddyMurray> maybe its the enters in the selector, not sure
[05:11:33] <fionn_> http://laravel.io/bin/Dejyn
[05:12:29] <TeddyMurray> well in this one, line 15
[05:12:40] <TeddyMurray> cover needs to be the selector, and after("#main-content")
[05:13:08] <fionn_> so do i just have the selectors the wrong way around?
[05:13:23] <TeddyMurray> nvm, using after is different you're right.. let me try to run this
[05:14:06] <fionn_> yeah tried switch and nothing
[05:14:24] <fionn_> hang on, phone brb
[05:15:33] <themojowill> howdy is it possible to override an option for a method that has been called in another script. EG file1.js calls $('.foo').method(options) I can't edit this file. I was to do in my file2.js $('.foo').method(new options) or simply change one option
[05:15:38] <TeddyMurray> np, running it now and debugging
[05:16:37] <TeddyMurray> fionn_, it works for me when i remove the countdown function
[05:16:39] <TeddyMurray> is that a plugin?
[05:17:25] <TeddyMurray> i usually use something like $("#main").append("<div></div>");
[05:17:56] <TeddyMurray> themojowill, you can probably overload the function if you give it different parameters
[05:19:09] <TeddyMurray> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12120962/overloading-functions-in-javascript
[05:19:14] <TeddyMurray> 2nd answer should help
[05:20:12] <TeddyMurray> looks like you can't overload in javascript, sorry hmm
[05:21:04] <TeddyMurray> is it coming from a cdn?
[05:23:31] <TeddyMurray> maybe write a function named differently, and make it call the function you want in an if statement that checks the params and calls the unchangable function or runs your code
[05:26:50] <shoky> themojowill: you can change $.fn.method to change $(..).method()  it'll only affect if your change is run before the method is called
[05:27:22] <TeddyMurray> cool
[05:30:31] <themojowill> shoky: is there no way to do it after the method has been called?
[05:30:33] <fionn_> TeddyMurray, it still doenst work for me even if i remove the countdown function
[05:32:21] <TeddyMurray> any errors in the console?
[05:36:36] <fionn_> undetermined string literal
[05:41:59] <shoky> themojowill: after the method has been called, it's already been called. you can't overwrite the past ;)
[05:42:34] <KebabBob> I'm running .ajax() on a click event. How can I access the caller ($(this)) within the success function? $(this) is overwritten (different scope) there with the data from the ajax request?
[05:43:47] <KebabBob> i.e. within the .click then $(this) is the <tr> that caused the click event, but within a .each in the success function then $(this) is the data being iterated..
[05:43:53] <shoky> KebabBob: you can put this outside   var elem = $(this);    for example
[05:44:10] <Cork> KebabBob: $.ajax({ context: this }
[05:44:22] <Cork> and this in the callback will be the same as outside
[05:44:24] <shoky> yep or that. or .bind(this) on the function
[05:45:18] <KebabBob> Ah, so I can do context: whatevervariablenameIlike to access the $(this) by another name?
[05:45:32] <Cork> no
[05:45:53] <Cork> context: whateveryouwant will make this == whateveryouwant inside the callback function
[05:46:47] <Cork> ex $.ajax({context: $(this)}).done(function(data) { this.find('#something').append(data).addClass('added') });
[05:47:07] <Cork> or $.ajax({context: this }).done(function(data) { $(this).find('#something').append(data).addClass('added') });
[05:48:21] <fionn_> cork, you from cork>?
[05:48:24] <Cork> no
[05:48:39] <KebabBob> Hmm I'm a little confused, but I'll play around with it a bit. Thanks for the tip Cork :)
[05:48:57] <Cork> KebabBob: context tags the value this should have inside the callback
[05:49:07] <Cork> it doesn't create a variable with that name :)
[05:49:21] <Cork> *takes the value
[05:49:40] <KebabBob> Hmm ok. that works for me.
[05:49:45] <KebabBob> I got it to work, and I think I understand
[05:50:32] <Cork> KebabBob: this might explain a bit more $.ajax does callback.call(argument.context)
[05:50:52] <Cork> and call: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/call
[05:51:29] <KebabBob> Thank you for the help, much apprecaited
[05:56:24] <Bjerre> did my last message get through or was I disconnected?
[05:56:34] <Bjerre> anyway, if not here it is again: Anyone who knows on how to make the background image move in translate instead so it get's on sub pixel level? I tried it with another jsfiddle but the image went on top of the sphere instead of being inside. Here is the one that uses pixel paint which is very laggy http://jsfiddle.net/Bjerre/2es2t8ef/
[06:01:03] <doonie> hail to the king
[06:01:23] <doonie> <----
[06:41:59] <Bjerre> Is it possible to lock a focus target after correct keyCode has been used? For example, in this jsfiddle I want to lock the focus target on the first one that you trigger. If I hit left arrow it should be locked on left button, same goes for the right arrow with right button. If you trigger the other arrow after this it should stay focused on the previous one. http://jsfiddle.net/Bjerre/3h270ov7/13/
[06:42:26] <Bjerre> kind of hard to explain I guess
[06:51:16] <fionn_> hey guys, trying to use insertAfter() to put a image as the first element in my main
[06:51:28] <fionn_> but its appneding it, putting it as the last element in it
[06:51:43] <Macaveli> Is it possible to trace a method click, like to see the methods that that method calls?
[06:51:56] <Cork> fionn_: use prepend()
[06:52:53] <Macaveli> like debug the whole process
[06:58:33] <Cork> Macaveli: not really,
[06:58:53] <Cork> Macaveli: depending on the browser you can list the event handlers bound on an element though
[06:59:01] <Cork> or rather depending on the debugger
[06:59:08] <fionn_> got it there with prepend! had the selectors reversed
[06:59:11] <fionn_> cheers :)
[07:16:52] <Bjerre> Anyone who knows on how to lock the focus target after it is triggered? I have a left and right arrow that is binded to focus on two classes. When I press left arrow I want it to disable the focus on the other class and the same thing goes for right arrow to disable the first class.  http://jsfiddle.net/Bjerre/3h270ov7/13/
[07:27:39] <CocoStorm> Hi guys, in the gamma gallery docs it show that you need to use <div data-src"something.jpg" />  which I've added to my project but I'm getting 'src' of undefined error.. In the demo it uses <img src="something.jpg"/> tags.  Could someone clarify what I should be using? http://tympanus.net/codrops/2012/11/06/gamma-gallery-a-responsive-image-gallery-experiment
[07:29:15] <monk3y> CocoStorm: I don't know the ultimate issue, but what you typed (pasted?) there doesn't have an '=' after data-src ..
[07:29:45] <CocoStorm> monk3y: yeah I was just writing an example and that's a typo
[07:29:52] <monk3y> Ok no probs.
[07:30:17] <CocoStorm> The actual code is in that link
[07:32:09] <monk3y> Bjerre: I'm not 100% sure this is the sexiest strategy, but once a key is pressed and one of the 'sides' is highlighted, just set a variable to say something is selected, then in the 'keydown' check, check if the variable has been set to see if something's been selected, then don't change the highlight if-so?
[07:32:32] <monk3y> If that- uh- makes sense.  Coffee hasn't hit yet.
[07:32:41] <dimi1947> I have 2 radio buttons with the same class but different values....how I can make checked one of them based on their value https://jsfiddle.net/fiddlehunt/u94ocf6k/
[07:33:56] <monk3y> Bjerre: the other way to do it is to register the on('keydown'.. events on each of the circles specifically, then once one's been selected, remove the keydown functions on each circle.
[07:36:38] <monk3y> CocoStorm: can you paste me the exact error message you get?  And can you make sure the image you're referencing exists, and can be loaded by an additional img src=".." element, just to make sure?
[07:38:16] <dimi1947> I found it
[07:39:26] <monk3y> dimi1947: was it $(".same_d[value='x']").(?)
[07:39:48] <monk3y> (curious)
[07:40:59] <googlee____> Does anyone have a second to perhaps fork this and or tell me how to achieve this effect without the music aspect. Or by having it use the sound from the music player already on my website http://codepen.io/ryanmcnz/pen/KppJxJ all help is super appreciated
[07:43:05] <phrearch> hi
[07:43:26] <phrearch> does jquery have a default way to parse url parameters to an object?
[07:43:47] <Cork> no
[07:43:54] <Cork> though you can use the dom
[07:44:23] <Cork> var parser = document.createElement('a'); parser.href = url; parser.domain
[07:44:26] <phrearch> Cork: does the dom have a native function for that, or does it require some custom parsing function?
[07:46:04] <CocoStorm> monk3y: The error I'm getting is Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'src' of undefined gamma.js:414 and that's the thing.. I don't have an image attribute with src=".." element since it doesn't tell me to add one in the docs (the link I showed you) and I'm not sure where to put one
[07:46:21] <phrearch> Cork, nice! seems like domain is undefined though
[07:49:39] <Cork> phrearch: it's hostname
[07:49:41] <Cork> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URLUtils
[07:58:49] <quansai> What's the difference between `$(function(){...})` and `function(){...}`?
[07:59:07] <CocoStorm> Hi guys, in the gamma gallery docs it show that you need to use <div data-src"something.jpg" />  which I've added to my project but I'm getting 'src' of undefined error.. In the demo it uses <img src="something.jpg"/> tags.  Could someone clarify what I should be using? http://tympanus.net/codrops/2012/11/06/gamma-gallery-a-responsive-image-gallery-experiment
[08:02:58] <Cork> quansai: the first one is a short hand for $(document).ready(func)
[08:03:06] <Cork> the second is just a function declaration
[08:03:25] <quansai> Cork: Thought so. Thanks a ton.
[08:03:40] <monk3y> CocoStorm: I know our replies are rare/intermittent, but probably best not to keep posting.  It'll be seen.  It's probably best you make a JSFiddle of your divs.  And by adding an <img src> for one of the images, I meant to test to make sure the images are reachable.
[08:04:19] <Cork> CocoStorm: ya, referencing the tutorial as a reference for what is wrong with your code won't work
[08:04:20] <CocoStorm> monk3y: Like I'm 80% certain an image tag with src is meant to be there but why isn't it in the docs
[08:04:28] <Cork> as it is quite likely you've missed something
[08:04:28] <CocoStorm> and where would I put it
[08:04:36] <Cork> jsfiddle.net
[08:04:49] <googlee____> Does anyone have a second to perhaps fork this and or tell me how to achieve this effect without the music aspect. Or by having it use the sound from the music player already on my website http://codepen.io/ryanmcnz/pen/KppJxJ all help is super appreciated
[08:04:59] <monk3y> CocoStorm: I'm not asking for the img tag in relation the library/docs, I'm asking for you to make sure the image is reachable.  Nothing to do with the library.
[08:05:05] <Cork> googlee____: ##freelance
[08:05:19] <Cork> googlee____: you can ask for help in how you do something you've got stuck with here
[08:05:25] <Cork> not ask someone to do you're work for you for free
[08:06:25] <Cork> opps *do your work*
[08:06:55] <googlee____> i appreciate your response Cork! I dont want to just have someone do it for me though. If one was to do it, it would be nice to have explained what was done in order to achieve this
[08:07:25] <Cork> googlee____: that isn't the purpose of this channel
[08:07:36] <Cork> try getting it done and ask if you get stock
[08:07:41] <CocoStorm> monk3y: I see, yeah it's reachable
[08:07:43] <Cork> don't ask someone else to do it and then explain it
[08:13:06] <Lauxley> Hi, if i do $('.foo').foo() and the foo pluggin add some foos to the DOM, how would i update the content of the query ? (i would need to do something like this = $(this.selector); in the plugin but obviously js won't let me do this
[08:13:59] <Lauxley> is there some interval value that i can reset so the query is re-evaluated or something
[08:15:04] <Cork> Lauxley: $.foo('.foo')
[08:15:19] <Cork> there isn't any interval or anything
[08:15:35] <Lauxley> Cork: i meant 'internal'
[08:15:36] <Cork> $() generates an array and the methods called on it just looks through the array of dom elements
[08:15:57] <Cork> this.selector was removed when .live was removed
[08:16:13] <Lauxley> Cork: i'll try this, thx
[08:21:04] <Lauxley> Cork: so if i understand you correctly i need to change my pluggin signature to jquery.foo(selector) and call $(selector) whenever i need the dom content right ?
[08:23:14] <Bjerre> sorry monk3y was away for a while. Yea that second one seems like it should do the job
[08:24:22] <Bjerre> not sure on how to check if it has been selected though monk3y
[08:26:37] <Zeranoe> Any idea why this doesn't work in IE 9 with Compatability View on? http://jsbin.com/kigesobaja/edit?html,output
[08:29:02] <Zeranoe> Looks like jsbin doesn't even work in IE 9 with Comparability View. Here is the example that doesn't work: http://paste.debian.net/261252/
[08:30:11] <eigentor> I want to check if a checkbox is checked on page load, and if so, perform an action. But this appears harder than it seems.
[08:30:51] <eigentor> If I try attr(), it checks all the checkboxes instead of looking into their status http://pastebin.com/23SYNP67
[08:31:09] <eigentor> .is(':checked') does not give me anything
[08:32:11] <arc_> if ($('.yourcheckbox:checked))
[08:32:13] <monk3y> eigentor: http://api.jquery.com/prop/
[08:32:32] <Bjerre> monk3y perhaps it's better to use something else then focus?
[08:32:39] <Bjerre> like active
[08:34:26] <arc_> sry i missed the close quote
[08:34:41] <eigentor> monk3y: I have to use an older version of jquery so prop is not there
[08:34:49] <monk3y> Ah.
[08:34:57] <Bjerre> I believe I messed I totally messed it up http://jsfiddle.net/Bjerre/3h270ov7/14/
[08:35:03] <Bjerre> ops
[08:35:11] <Bjerre> too fast to edit my own sentence, well well
[08:35:33] <arc_> did that work eigentor
[08:36:28] <eigentor> arc_ no
[08:36:30] <arc_> seems to work for me in jquery 1.6.4. i hope yours isn't older than that
[08:36:58] <eigentor> mine is indeed older
[08:37:03] <arc_> ;/
[08:37:19] <eigentor> this should hide every checked checkbox on the page, right? http://pastebin.com/cFt4iCDU
[08:37:34] <arc_> no
[08:37:50] <arc_> that's not what $(this) does
[08:38:06] <arc_> on what event are you calling this document ready?
[08:38:12] <eigentor> yes
[08:39:05] <eigentor> ok this works $('input:checkbox:checked').hide();
[08:39:36] <arc_> ya
[08:39:37] <Zeranoe> Any idea why this is not working in IE 9 with compatibility view on? http://paste.debian.net/261253/
[08:40:30] <monk3y> Bjerre: I'm still thinking on this one.  Can I just check your requirements?  So once you click or 'arrow' the circle you want, it's locked on that selection, no break-out from there?
[08:40:58] <Bjerre> yes that's right monk3y.
[08:41:05] <Bjerre> I'm working on a PSA
[08:41:14] <Bjerre> and once you click on arrow it should jump to the next "page"
[08:41:25] <Bjerre> that's already solved, however you can still trigger the other one between animations
[08:41:28] <Bjerre> so that's what I want to get rid of
[08:41:38] <monk3y> Bjerre: oh?  Of an accordion or wizard-style thing?  Like, you're not hitting 'right' then going to new page, right?
[08:41:47] <Zeranoe> It also doesn't work in IE 11 if you select IE 7 from developer http://hospital.miblood.org/test-force.html
[08:42:17] <Zeranoe> http://paste.debian.net/261253/
[08:43:06] <monk3y> Anyone: I've never edited someone else's JSFiddle before. How do I make my own copy?  Fork?  Or use Collaboration?  I'm guessing 'Update' stomps their original version?
[08:43:15] <Bjerre> don't know how to describe it monk3y, it's a crossfade I guess between the pages. If you hit left arrow it will trigger one page, if you hit right arrow it will trigger another one. The trigger works perfect but the highlight is still triggered even if the crossfade happens.
[08:43:18] <eigentor> O.K. finally I got it
[08:43:26] <eigentor> my entire if statemend was nonsense
[08:43:35] <arc_> lol :)
[08:44:20] <eigentor> I just wanted to keep a box not collapsed if a checkbox inside it is checked. So this works http://pastebin.com/MNdNJdgM
[08:44:51] <Bjerre> also the focus is bad since I use both fysical and digital buttons monk3y. So the highlight disappear if you click somewhere on the screen. It should be static and not removed but only if you go back to the page again.
[08:45:18] <arc_> are you sure you need this complicated of a selector?
[08:45:25] <Bjerre> so my guess would be using an active css class is better, not sure on how to implement it though
[08:49:35] <robertmaxrees> goooood morning #jquery
[08:49:40] <Bjerre> hello robertmaxrees
[08:49:47] <Bjerre> how's your day been? :)
[08:50:03] <robertmaxrees> interesting!  yours?
[08:50:10] <Bjerre> monk3y: you can save it, doesn't matter
[08:50:15] <Bjerre> it's fine
[08:50:25] <Bjerre> some code problems but it's ok
[08:50:43] <Bjerre> monk3y: it will save a new version of it. It's easy to go back to older ones
[08:51:44] <Zeranoe> It seems jquery doesn't actually work very well in IE 7.... http://paste.debian.net/261255/ "jquery is working" doesn't even show on IE7
[08:52:24] <Bjerre> why even bother with IE7
[08:52:34] <robertmaxrees> Zeranoe $( "body" ).before( "<h1>jquery is working</h1>" );
[08:52:37] <robertmaxrees> that won't work.
[08:52:38] <Bjerre> people have to get used to new versions :)
[08:52:41] <robertmaxrees> that's not valid html.
[08:52:50] <robertmaxrees> Bjerre not our job to make that decision sometimes ;)
[08:53:17] <Bjerre> lucky me I only develop for chromium robertmaxrees
[08:53:22] <Bjerre> for now at least
[08:53:35] <AcidBeard> Also, IE can be weird, make sure your script tags look like <script type="text/javascript">
[08:53:42] <dimi1947> I have teo radio buttons...one is cheked...both have the same class....how am I going to get the value of the checked one...0 in this example   https://jsfiddle.net/fiddlehunt/u94ocf6k/2/
[08:53:45] <Zeranoe> robertmaxrees: Alright, this works. http://paste.debian.net/261256/ But the .on event does not
[08:54:07] <Bjerre> dont forget <!DOCTYPE html> as well Zeranoe :)
[08:54:53] <robertmaxrees> dimi1947 use .on() and check $(this).val()
[08:54:55] <robertmaxrees> or this.value
[08:54:59] <Bjerre> did you try something out monk3y or can I ask again?
[08:55:00] <Zeranoe> Bjerre: It's in there. jquery seems to function on IE 7, but I cannot get the .on to work
[08:55:16] <robertmaxrees> Zeranoe jquery 1.x works back to ie6
[08:55:18] <Bjerre> ok Zeranoe :)
[08:55:34] <robertmaxrees> but that .before() call results in a bad document, which is why that won't work.
[08:55:50] <Bjerre> robertmaxrees: would you prefer 1.x or 2.x?
[08:55:50] <Zeranoe> robertmaxrees: I guess not the same way, unless my example is incorrect in general, it works fine in IE 9>
[08:55:59] <robertmaxrees> Bjerre depends on the browsers you need to support.
[08:56:09] <robertmaxrees> Zeranoe you cannot do $('body').before()
[08:56:18] <robertmaxrees> that isn't valid.  you can do $('body').append();
[08:56:21] <Zeranoe> robertmaxrees: Right, I fixed that
[08:56:33] <Bjerre> ok
[08:56:34] <Zeranoe> robertmaxrees: the .on event is now the bugger
[08:56:36] <robertmaxrees> Zeranoe and it still doesn't work, even with valid script tags?
[08:56:52] <robertmaxrees> one sec.
[08:58:31] <Zeranoe> robertmaxrees: This is my example where .on isn't working the same for IE 8 and lower. It seems to work in IE 9
[08:58:40] <robertmaxrees> one sec.
[08:58:41] <Zeranoe> robertmaxrees: http://paste.debian.net/261257/
[08:58:55] <Bjerre> ok I'm asking again. I fucked up this code, was trying to implement .active instead of focus since I don't want any mouse clicks to remove the highlighted button. I need a way to lock the highlighted button so you can't trigger the right arrow after pressing left arrow and vice versa. Is there any way to do that? http://jsfiddle.net/Bjerre/3h270ov7/14/
[08:59:23] <Bjerre> don't laugh at me :(
[09:00:22] <robertmaxrees> Zeranoe oh, hah.
[09:00:43] <Zeranoe> robertmaxrees: something simple isn;t it
[09:00:43] <robertmaxrees> i know exactly what the issue is - 'input'\
[09:00:55] <robertmaxrees> that event doesn't exist in old IE, and .on() doesn't polyfill those for you.
[09:01:28] <Bjerre> the legend got an answer to everything
[09:01:38] <AcidBeard> Bjerre: make a global variable, something like: var beenPressed = false;
[09:01:49] <Zeranoe> robertmaxrees: Any events that are similar for IE 6+ ?
[09:01:53] <AcidBeard> And one a key has been pressed set it to true
[09:01:57] <Bjerre> problem is that nothing works now AcidBeard
[09:02:02] <robertmaxrees> Zeranoe keydown, keypress, keyup.
[09:02:08] <robertmaxrees> Zeranoe open your console.
[09:02:13] <AcidBeard> Ctrl Z till it does
[09:02:14] <robertmaxrees> err, Bjerre, open your console
[09:02:36] <robertmaxrees> this.addClass('active'); - this won't work.
[09:02:41] <AcidBeard> this.addClass('active');
[09:02:50] <AcidBeard> Oh yeah, what he said
[09:02:56] <robertmaxrees> also, $ballbuttons = $('.ballbtn'); isn't valid.  you need to slap a 'var' if front of that ;0
[09:03:30] <Bjerre> var is my worst enemy
[09:03:36] <Zeranoe> robertmaxrees: Is there a list of events that IE versions support, or did you pull that from memory?
[09:03:37] <Bjerre> he always lurks somewhere
[09:03:45] <Uhkis> Bjerre: in war with var?
[09:03:50] <Bjerre> yep
[09:03:54] <Bjerre> 1-0 to var atm
[09:04:13] <robertmaxrees> Zeranoe i just remembered it.  mdn can tell you on an event-by-event basis.  javascript kit had a table that lisyted that info iirc.
[09:05:08] <Bjerre> what the hell should I have instead of $this?
[09:05:14] <robertmaxrees> $(this)
[09:05:15] <Bjerre> $that? :E
[09:05:20] <Bjerre> ok
[09:05:25] <robertmaxrees> Bjerre 'this' in your case is the raw DOM node.
[09:05:43] <Bjerre> oh I see
[09:05:53] <robertmaxrees> $(this) is the jquery node.
[09:06:01] <robertmaxrees> err, "jquery object"
[09:06:21] <Bjerre> http://jsfiddle.net/Bjerre/3h270ov7/16/
[09:06:31] <Bjerre> well it kinda works, not the remove class though
[09:06:35] <Bjerre> and I want it to lock down
[09:06:42] <robertmaxrees> aaaah alerts
[09:06:44] <Bjerre> so you can't access the other one after click
[09:06:44] <AcidBeard> $('#ballbtn1').addClass('.active');
[09:06:47] <AcidBeard> Nope
[09:06:51] <AcidBeard> $('#ballbtn1').addClass('active');
[09:06:53] <AcidBeard> Yep
[09:07:28] <Bjerre> the dot...
[09:07:52] <robertmaxrees> have you tried andding a console log before that addclass?
[09:08:02] <robertmaxrees> *adding
[09:08:04] <Bjerre> I'm afraid of that robertmaxrees
[09:08:12] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[09:08:20] <Bjerre> the console of errors right?
[09:08:24] <Bjerre> :)
[09:08:30] <robertmaxrees> wut
[09:08:34] <arc_> D:
[09:08:45] <Bjerre> well I thought you meant there were ton of errors
[09:08:50] <AcidBeard> http://jsfiddle.net/3h270ov7/17/
[09:08:58] <AcidBeard> That should do it
[09:09:13] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/3h270ov7/18/
[09:09:19] <robertmaxrees> i just meant that you should do this.
[09:09:26] <robertmaxrees> Bjerre and errors will break code.
[09:09:33] <robertmaxrees> soooo you should check your console and fix errors.
[09:09:55] <Bjerre> 'wut'
[09:10:00] <arc_> you only use the '.' when it's a selector. you are just giving the name of a class
[09:10:10] <Bjerre> I see arc_
[09:10:49] <arc_> but ya the console log is your friend
[09:10:58] <robertmaxrees> the console in general is your friend.
[09:11:06] <robertmaxrees> http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide1
[09:11:07] <Bjerre> that's working great AcidBeard, is there a way to block the other button to be clicked after you've pressed e.g btn1?
[09:11:26] <AcidBeard> Check the hasPressed var
[09:11:38] <robertmaxrees> Bjerre you could check to see if ($('.active').length) {}
[09:12:04] <Aristy> Hi guys, I have a small issue.
[09:12:10] <Bjerre> ah it worked AcidBeard on the arrows
[09:12:11] <Bjerre> awesome
[09:12:15] <Bjerre> didn't notice
[09:12:18] <Bjerre> thank you so much guys
[09:12:33] <Aristy> I have a class selector like this: $('.somediv');
[09:12:37] <Zeranoe> robertmaxrees: So for keydown and keypress the substitution/restriction kicks in after the first input. With keyup the character is quickly shown and then removed. Is this as close as I can get to input? http://jsbin.com/kigesobaja/edit?html,output
[09:12:39] <Bjerre> that link robertmaxrees is it worth taking a look at? I guess it's a guide?
[09:12:49] <robertmaxrees> Bjerre it's a GREAT guide.
[09:12:50] <Aristy> I need to target them each invidually, so I did this:
[09:12:51] <robertmaxrees> you should give it a read.
[09:13:05] <robertmaxrees> Aristy try making a fiddle and just asking your question in one or two sentences :)
[09:13:10] <Bjerre> ok awesome
[09:13:12] <AcidBeard> Aristy: Pastebin please
[09:13:16] <Aristy> okay
[09:13:25] <AcidBeard> Or yeah, JSFiddle
[09:13:30] <Bjerre> pff AcidBeard! not jsfiddle
[09:13:32] <Bjerre> ye that's right
[09:13:43] <robertmaxrees> huh?>
[09:13:52] <robertmaxrees> oh, yeah - avoid pastebin :)
[09:13:54] <Bjerre> jsfiddle for the win
[09:14:06] <robertmaxrees> Zeranoe there's also keypress.
[09:14:12] <Bjerre> I'm guessing my sentences doesn't make any sense
[09:14:20] <robertmaxrees> i can't remember all of the events.  i'd search around for more info.
[09:14:20] <Bjerre> I'm quiet now :E
[09:15:03] <Zeranoe> robertmaxrees: I included keypress in my example: http://jsbin.com/kigesobaja/edit?html,output you can see the replacement only kicks in after the first characters has already been input. (try inserting a special chacter, like =)
[09:15:24] <robertmaxrees> Zeranoe what are you actually trying to accomplish?
[09:15:29] <robertmaxrees> like, what's ideal here?
[09:15:49] <Zeranoe> robertmaxrees: $().on("input") for < IE8
[09:16:07] <robertmaxrees> right, but you can't have input, so what's preferable?
[09:16:19] <arc_> that question made me think of something. out of curiosity, might it be a good idea, when you want to make an object unclickable, to use a delegated event and remove 'clickable' class from the element, or is that just overcomplicated for no reason
[09:17:00] <robertmaxrees> arc_ really depends on the use case.  i'd make a check in the event handler for some other criteria, instead of adding a class to everything that should be clickable.
[09:17:21] <robertmaxrees> Zeranoe i ask because http://benalpert.com/2013/06/18/a-near-perfect-oninput-shim-for-ie-8-and-9.html
[09:17:32] <robertmaxrees> you could also just use .input() and see if that works correctly.
[09:17:45] <Zeranoe> robertmaxrees: Restricting input to a-z in the cleanest way possible with support down to IE 7
[09:18:02] <arc_> the main benefit i was thinking of was that it seems like it would be more readable, but if it's less efficient it's not worth it
[09:20:01] <Zeranoe> robertmaxrees: More specifically, restricted to something like '/[^a-z0-9]/ig'
[09:21:23] <Aristy> Can I target jQuery HTML Collections one by one? Like $('.something').each(function() {
[09:21:35] <Aristy> :0, :1, or so
[09:23:56] <robertmaxrees> Aristy did you make a fiddle? :)
[09:24:07] <robertmaxrees> you can use .each(), but usually you don't need to.
[09:24:08] <Aristy> robertmaxrees: making
[09:27:16] <Aristy> robertmaxrees: Done http://pastebin.com/zuyw9eVt
[09:27:39] <robertmaxrees> wut
[09:28:12] <Aristy> Mate, let me explain the situation. It's much easier than writing a pastebin :)
[09:28:17] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[09:28:23] <robertmaxrees> a running fiddle would be the best.
[09:28:50] <Aristy> I have 10x elements with class="something" on the DOM
[09:29:06] <robertmaxrees> no offense, but explaining rarely works - you're stuck and don't know what the issue is.  that usually means there's an assumption or something else getting in the way :)
[09:29:41] <robertmaxrees> i also don't know what Widget() and bindPlaceholder() are trying to do.
[09:29:42] <Aristy> I just need to find a way to target each of them individually
[09:29:45] <Aristy> That's all
[09:29:51] <robertmaxrees> .each() lets you do that.
[09:29:59] <robertmaxrees> $(this) would be the jquery object within it.
[09:29:59] <Aristy> Like $('something:[0]');
[09:30:19] <Aristy> I tried passing $(this)
[09:30:35] <Aristy> Then it inserts 10x Hello world into first one, then 9x to second one, then 8x to third one and so on
[09:31:01] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/qfq3mLvs/
[09:31:33] <Aristy> robertmaxrees: Sec, let me try to get you a fiddle. :)
[09:31:33] <robertmaxrees> within .each(), $(this) is the current element.
[09:31:51] <robertmaxrees> rather, 'this' is the current DOM node, $(this) is the current jquery object.
[09:32:06] <robertmaxrees> i'm going to guess ytou don't need var obj = new Widget();
[09:32:15] <robertmaxrees> *in the .each(), but instead put it before.
[09:38:23] <AcidBeard> Aristy:  This what you are trying to do?  http://jsfiddle.net/duvj5mnk/
[09:42:24] <AcidBeard> Oh and if you really need to select them individually, use nth-child(x)
[09:42:46] <robertmaxrees> var end = 10; ?
[09:43:24] <AcidBeard> ...what?
[09:43:33] <robertmaxrees> why not just var end = $('.something').length; ?
[09:44:15] <AcidBeard> Yeah, that would allow any number of divs, he said ten so I was thinking ten
[09:59:14] <AcidBeard> What's the difference between something like $.on("click) and $.click() ?
[09:59:26] <__Ralf> Hey, everyone. Would anyone know if there is a way to get all predecending styles for an element.. Like.. In a stylesheet you can set styles on elements by different selectors, or ids, which override the same styles multiple times. like, i set an overall style to .myselector, and then in a media query, i override a style, lets say width: ; in that media query, is there a way to get styles before
[09:59:26] <__Ralf> it was overwritten?
[09:59:32] <robertmaxrees> .click() uses .on('click') AcidBeard
[10:00:03] <AcidBeard> So it's a little faster then?
[10:00:16] <robertmaxrees> sure?  not in any meaningful way.
[10:00:41] <AcidBeard> So it's mainly preference..?
[10:00:46] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[10:00:54] <robertmaxrees> i tend to prefer .on() for all event bindings.
[10:01:39] <AcidBeard> __Ralf: The short answer: No
[10:01:51] <__Ralf> Dang, Long answer?
[10:02:09] <AcidBeard> Sore the old value in a variable
[10:02:18] <__Ralf> I mean, the browser can somehow identify predecending styles, still.. Are they querying the Browsers CSS Rules?
[10:02:19] <AcidBeard> Store*
[10:02:51] <arc_> robertmaxrees i thought the difference had something to do with what elements get bound to the event in some cases
[10:02:52] <AcidBeard> Can you JSFiddle it?
[10:03:03] <arc_> i don't remember the details obviously
[10:03:28] <__Ralf> JSFiddle it? Me?
[10:03:39] <arc_> yes you
[10:03:42] <AcidBeard> Yeah
[10:03:50] <__Ralf> JSFiddle what?
[10:03:53] <ganeshaditya1> Hey how do you set the html of a span tag by id ?? I tried $('span#id_of_the_span_tag').html("<b>something</b>"); but it doesn't work
[10:04:05] <Kartagis> jsfiddle.net
[10:04:08] <AcidBeard> What you are trying to do
[10:04:11] <__Ralf> i was just thinking of a theoretical way to create a new feature, so i don't really have anything to fiddle :P
[10:04:18] <AcidBeard> Ah, ok
[10:04:33] <AcidBeard> Gimme a sec
[10:05:03] <__Ralf> Basicly, if you take "Firebug" for example; If you open it up, it lists, all styles that possibly were chained to that element. and the (linethrough) styles, that were overridden, basicly. I hoped that i could access that information with Jquery/Javascript too
[10:05:05] <arc_> ganeshaditya1 first of all, as i've been scolded recently, you don't need to write the element tag in the selector when you are selecting by id
[10:06:02] <arc_> secondly, that method should work. there may be something else causing your problem
[10:07:47] <ganeshaditya1> Ahhh man... I tried alert($('span#' + cno).html()); but it doesn't work!
[10:07:59] <ganeshaditya1> I also tried alert($('#' + cno).html());
[10:08:03] <ganeshaditya1> and that doesn't work
[10:08:37] <arc_> do you have a fiddle
[10:08:41] <arc_> or can you paste the code somewhere
[10:08:49] <arc_> i'm guessing what you are assigning to the variable cno is not what you think it is
[10:09:12] <ganeshaditya1> I tried printing cno ... that's fine
[10:09:20] <ganeshaditya1> Let me try to copy this into a fiddle.
[10:09:21] <arc_> so it returns just a string?
[10:09:32] <ganeshaditya1> cno is a number..
[10:09:37] <arc_> well whatever it is :p
[10:09:43] <robertmaxrees> ganeshaditya1 and you're not duplicating IDs, right?
[10:10:24] <ganeshaditya1> @robertmaxrees Cno is primary key and it is comming from a db .... so no .. there;s no way IDs are being duplicated here.
[10:10:35] <robertmaxrees> i'd triple check that.
[10:11:02] <robertmaxrees> $('[id="' + cno + '"]').length
[10:13:24] <ganeshaditya1> Length is 2 :O :O It is being duplicated!
[10:13:33] <ganeshaditya1> Good call man :)
[10:13:37] <robertmaxrees> yep ;)
[11:06:51] <Ice_Strike> I am not sure if that is possible, there will be html5 video on a page.. user listen a call and select a classification. When user select a classification it will automatically get a duration from a audio
[11:06:56] <Ice_Strike> Is this possible?
[11:28:49] <Zeranoe> Does jquery support any way open the print dialog box to print a pdf document? I know print() does the current page, but I want to feed it a pdf (if possible)
[11:30:48] <dichtbringer> mhh, is there an easy way to make firefox and ie propagate iframe mousewheel events to the parent?
[11:31:31] <dichtbringer> i have embedded the iframe's total height in the parent, so i don't need to scroll the iframe itself, but rather the parent. it works in chrome, but firefox and ie block mousewheel event propagation
[11:31:35] <dichtbringer> the iframe is same domain
[11:37:54] <legrandin> how can I set up a function where another function is called when some text is changed. this is what I have so far and It doesnt seem to be working: https://bpaste.net/show/6018195d0ef8
[11:38:19] <robertmaxrees> 'change' isn't a valid event.
[11:38:27] <robertmaxrees> you can use input, keydown, keypress, etc.
[11:38:39] <legrandin> wht about .change()
[11:38:52] <robertmaxrees> derp.
[11:38:58] <robertmaxrees> that IS a valid event.  my bad!
[11:39:02] <legrandin> lol
[11:39:29] <robertmaxrees> just got back from vacation haha
[11:39:40] <robertmaxrees> wait what is #status ?
[11:39:43] <robertmaxrees> is it an input?
[11:39:48] <legrandin> so basically I have an ajax call taht changes the text of $("#status") and I want another function watching that same selector and doing something when it changes
[11:40:02] <legrandin> its just a text box displaying the status of the web crawler
[11:40:05] <robertmaxrees> that's why - "The change event is sent to an element when its value changes. This event is limited to <input> elements, <textarea> boxes and <select> elements."
[11:40:15] <legrandin> ohhh
[11:40:44] <legrandin> so is there something else I could be using here?
[11:41:11] <robertmaxrees> you'd need to use dom mutation observers, but i'd just hook into the ajax function itself.
[11:42:10] <legrandin> yeah the problem is there are multiple ajax calls going on. trying to make it a bit more streamlined. what are dom mutation observers?
[11:42:25] <robertmaxrees> ugly.
[11:42:33] <robertmaxrees> use ajax callbacks. trust me.
[11:42:38] <legrandin> lol
[11:42:57] <legrandin> trying to be DRY about it
[11:43:09] <robertmaxrees> don't use mutation observers imo.  they're gross.
[11:43:21] <legrandin> ok, well, maybe I could change the overall ajax settings?
[11:43:26] <robertmaxrees> no.
[11:43:34] <robertmaxrees> if you want to be DRY, have a single place that handles all your ajax stuff and let it decide on what to do.
[11:44:35] <legrandin> thanks
[11:46:18] <Zeranoe> Does jquery support any way open the print dialog box to print a pdf document? I know print() does the current page, but I want to feed it a pdf (if possible)
[11:47:27] <acidjazz> whos got recommendations of starting JS for someone
[11:47:32] <acidjazz> websites/etc

[11:48:01] <robertmaxrees> Zeranoe http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16239513/print-pdf-directly-from-javascript
[11:48:18] <legrandin> acidjazz: what are your  goals?
[11:48:34] <robertmaxrees> acidjazz there are a lot of resources.  codecademy, mdn, eloquent javascript...
[11:48:40] <legrandin> are you a designer or developer?
[11:48:45] <acidjazz> to link someone the best is my goal
[11:48:49] <acidjazz> i want something interactive
[11:49:07] <legrandin> i'd reccomend codeacademy then
[11:49:14] <robertmaxrees> there's no single "best" fwiw
[11:49:28] <robertmaxrees> MDN is probably the most consistently good overall resource.
[11:49:37] <legrandin> if you want a deeper understanding and you are up for studying, then i'd read eloquent javascript
[11:49:44] <legrandin> agreed robertmaxrees
[11:49:56] <legrandin> w3schools has some good info but is mostly meh
[11:50:09] <robertmaxrees> *bad info
[11:50:16] <robertmaxrees> http://www.w3fools.com/ fwiw
[11:50:30] <legrandin> its accurate, so I wouldnt say its bad
[11:50:34] <robertmaxrees> no it's not.
[11:50:40] <legrandin> whats not accurate
[11:51:02] <robertmaxrees> i can't remember off the top of my head, but it had problems for years.  i always tell people to avoid it - refer to http://www.w3fools.com/ for more.
[11:51:17] <legrandin> well theres an easy way to test whether its accurate :D
[11:51:19] <acidjazz> MDN is for if ou want to fall asleep
[11:51:28] <robertmaxrees> MDN is for it you want accurate, good docs.
[11:51:40] <acidjazz> displayed in a way to disgust
[11:51:46] <robertmaxrees> *in a way to educate.
[11:51:49] <legrandin> uhh acidjazz id prefer not to blow my brains out so I use MDN
[11:52:32] <acidjazz> I think the MDN current theme is "mental hospital"
[11:52:40] <acidjazz> lol
[11:52:51] <acidjazz> This is for a beginner
[11:52:55] <acidjazz> something like codeacademy is perfect
[11:52:58] <legrandin> use codeacademy
[11:53:05] <acidjazz> keep ahold of their attention
[11:53:08] <legrandin> are you a web designer?
[11:53:19] <acidjazz> no im a developer
[11:53:39] <legrandin> what does it matter that it looks like :D
[11:53:56] <robertmaxrees> ^
[11:54:01] <robertmaxrees> accurate info is what you need.
[11:55:05] <acidjazz> I just want him to get inspired with something interactive
[11:55:21] <acidjazz> and not horrid
[11:55:22] <acidjazz> looking
[11:55:27] <robertmaxrees> what's the target audience, then?
[11:55:30] <acidjazz> like MDN's "nails on a white calkboard" wordpress theme
[11:55:41] <robertmaxrees> like, is this for you?  or somebody who's kind of interested in maybe learning?
[11:55:51] <acidjazz> robertmaxrees: really? you see me help people in here all the time
[11:55:55] <acidjazz> you really think i need to learn JS
[11:56:01] <acidjazz> are you trolling me
[11:56:09] <acidjazz> a buddy who wants to get into it
[11:56:16] <robertmaxrees> calm down duder.  sometimes people are looking for a refresher or to go over the basics again.
[11:56:23] <acidjazz> NO WE DUEL
[11:56:43] <robertmaxrees> and try codecademy in that case.  encourage mdn for documentation outside of that.
[11:56:52] <acidjazz> My personal favs are anything John Resig
[11:56:59] <acidjazz> thanks i linked codeacademy its perfect
[11:57:02] <legrandin> you've activated my trap framework!
[11:57:34] <robertmaxrees> berb
[12:16:08] <sadtaco> Uh... has anyone ever had a problem of jQuery selectors just plain breaking in Chrome but not Firefox?
[12:16:23] <sadtaco> Like I can see an element with a class on the page but a selector won't find it like I know it should
[12:16:26] <sadtaco> and won't find it like Firefox does
[12:19:02] <robertmaxrees> any console errors?
[12:19:08] <robertmaxrees> there can be a few things that contribute to that.
[12:20:10] <arup_r> How can I next 4 dates from a current date as an array
[12:20:37] <robertmaxrees> arup_r depends. how'd you get the current date?
[12:21:38] <arup_r> as a string "2015-06-28"
[12:21:59] <robertmaxrees> right, but did you get it from the same array you want the next 4 from?
[12:22:31] <robertmaxrees> all you need is the current index, then grab the next 4.
[12:22:34] <arup_r> I am getting it after selecting a date from the calender
[12:22:44] <arup_r> No.. I have no array
[12:22:46] <robertmaxrees> what sort of browser support?
[12:23:02] <robertmaxrees> oh, you mean you want the next 4 in an array?
[12:23:05] <arup_r> I have to build an array of next 4 dates from the current date
[12:23:09] <arup_r> Yes
[12:23:14] <robertmaxrees> fiddle?
[12:23:34] <robertmaxrees> or just use moment.js to handle all of that.
[12:23:50] <arup_r> I don't have fiddle.. only the code I can share which I am writing...
[12:24:18] <robertmaxrees> check out moment and see if it can help here

[12:30:11] <SirLagz> I'm appending divs to a page, and each div has a header that I'm attaching .click() handlers on. Is it better to do it when I append the divs, or do it after all the divs are appended all in one go?
[12:30:11] <decx> the double new Date is pretty ugly
[12:30:16] <decx> i'd just push the epoch
[12:30:24] <robertmt> hey
[12:30:26] <arthurvr> yoyo
[12:30:35] <robertmaxrees> SirLagz neither - use event delegation.
[12:30:46] * SirLagz goes to google event delegation
[12:30:48] <arthurvr> what’s up robertmaxrees
[12:30:50] <arthurvr> ohh sorry
[12:30:53] <robertmaxrees> hey arthurvr
[12:30:54] <arthurvr> this is going to be confusing
[12:30:58] <arthurvr> meant robertmt
[12:31:00] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events SirLagz
[12:31:14] <robertmt> bad nickname choice?
[12:31:23] <robertmaxrees> you'll be fine :)
[12:31:32] <arthurvr> nah I should learn to tab complete better :p
[12:31:51] <robertmaxrees> i was gone for a while so people aren't use to my name being around ;0
[12:32:13] <robertmt> so I'm building a game, sort of a word puzzle like thing
[12:32:23] <robertmt> just for learning and for fun
[12:32:36] <SirLagz> robertmaxrees: thanks
[12:34:40] <SirLagz> time to refactor some code then!
[12:34:47] <robertmaxrees> get the idea?
[12:34:52] <SirLagz> don't know how I forgot about event delegation...I used it all throughout last year =/
[12:35:02] <robertmaxrees> forest through the trees probably.
[12:35:50] <garethdaine> Folks, I’ve written a little jQuery plugin that checks and unchecks all checkboxes based on the change event of a specific checkbox. This works great but I’d like to remove/add a class to an element based on whether any or all checkboxes are checked. Any ideas how I may achieve this? I’m got so far as to have this work if all or none are selected but not individually or multiples.
[12:36:20] <robertmt> and wondering how I could detect typos of specific words using some kind of library.
[12:36:44] <SirLagz> bloody internet keeps dropping out...stupid internet
[12:36:54] <NoiseEee> garethdaine: remove all classes whenever something is clicked/checked, and add classes appropriately
[12:37:28] <arthurvr> robertmt: one of the most popular ways of doing that is by using the levenshtein distance: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance. It checks for similarity between two strings. You could as well try to be even more intelligent by basing upon keyboard layout and specific typos. That can end up being tricky as there's more than one keyboard layout out there (actually many!) and thus not reliable for a game IMHO. A g
[12:37:29] <arthurvr> example is this => https://github.com/sindresorhus/yn/blob/master/lenient.js
[12:37:44] <arthurvr> One of the fastest implementation of levenshtein you can find out there in javascript is called `leven` on npm.
[12:37:47] <arthurvr> google it lol
[12:37:54] <garethdaine> Sure NoiseEee. But say I have ten checkboxes. I want the class added if only one or multiple are checked but I only want it removed if there are no checkboxes checked
[12:38:23] <NoiseEee> well any click is going to fire the event, garethdaine
[12:38:24] <robertmaxrees> if ($('.checked').length) {}
[12:38:41] <robertmt> you're my hero today arthurvr
[12:38:45] <robertmt> thanks mannn
[12:38:46] <NoiseEee> so any click should remove all classes,  but if there are any checked boxes, add appropriate classes
[12:38:49] <robertmt> rocks
[12:39:12] <arthurvr> my pleasure robertmt
[12:39:38] <robertmt> so a good implementation is http://npmjs.org/leven ?
[12:39:51] <arthurvr> define ”good”. It’s the fastest one at least.
[12:40:00] <arthurvr> always worked fine for my needs
[12:42:06] <arthurvr> gotta leave. Bye everybody!
[12:42:13] <sadtaco> robertmaxrees, nope no console errors.
[12:42:22] <sadtaco> And I can't really make a jsfiddle because it'll work fine there.
[12:42:35] <robertmt> i've been searching for something similar for hours and just gave me arthurvr :)
[12:42:43] <robertmt> bye!
[12:43:11] <robertmaxrees> sadtaco sounds like things are happening out of order?
[12:43:12] <sadtaco> Like I can select $('.select').eq(0) ... [<div class=​"select">​…​</div>​]  Then I can $('.select').eq(0).closest('.statements') and get [<div class=​"statements constructorFns ui-sortable">​…​</div>​]  But if I $('.select').eq(0).closest('.constructorFns') I get []
[12:43:29] <sadtaco> You can CLEARLY see that there is a closest with .constructorFns
[12:43:36] <sadtaco> Because it selects it with  $('.select').eq(0).closest('.statements')
[12:43:54] <sadtaco> So... the only way $('.select').eq(0).closest('.constructorFns') could not work is something going screwy with jquery selectors it seems? :/
[12:43:56] <robertmaxrees> $('.select').eq(0).closest('.statements').prop('class')
[12:43:58] <robertmaxrees> check that,
[12:44:04] <sadtaco> but... why?
[12:44:27] <sadtaco> As a test? sure. But as a solution? It's not
[12:44:31] <robertmaxrees> no.
[12:44:32] <sadtaco> "statements constructorFns ui-sortable"
[12:44:35] <robertmaxrees> ...
[12:44:41] <robertmt> I had another question is anyone else around to help me out?
[12:44:42] <sadtaco> Yeah. Crazy shit, right?
[12:44:48] <robertmaxrees> slow down
[12:44:54] <robertmaxrees> since i don't have the code in front of me i have no way of knowing what's going on.
[12:44:58] <sadtaco> Gotta go fast.
[12:45:11] <sadtaco> Yeah I get that.
[12:45:14] <robertmaxrees> you won't make a fiddle so it's hard for me to help.
[12:45:30] <robertmaxrees> i wasn't suggesting the .prop() check as a solution, just as a check.
[12:45:39] <sadtaco> Yeah fair enough
[12:45:47] <sadtaco> I said that myself already :P
[12:45:48] <robertmaxrees> what if you just do $('.select').closest('.statements');
[12:45:50] <robertmaxrees> what's that?
[12:46:23] <sadtaco> [<div class=​"statements constructorFns ui-sortable">​…​</div>​, <div class=​"statements constructorFns ui-sortable">​…​</div>​]
[12:47:09] <rembol> hello world
[12:47:09] <sadtaco> Which, interesting, is not all of the elements of that on the page.
[12:47:20] <sadtaco> Only selects 2 out of 6
[12:47:26] <rembol> I'm new to IRC is this the right place to chat about the write less, do more library?
[12:47:33] <robertmaxrees> so then your code is likely running out of order, sadtaco
[12:47:40] <robertmaxrees> rembol yep.  this is the jquery chat.
[12:47:53] <sadtaco> Hm. What causes that? Why is it happening in chrome and not FF? How do I fix it?
[12:48:17] <robertmaxrees> how can i answer that question if i don't have the code in front of me?
[12:48:28] <sadtaco> but... this is just stuff I'm running in console
[12:48:38] <robertmaxrees> all of it?  even the broken code?
[12:48:50] <robertmaxrees> because invalid markup can cause all kinds of headaches.
[12:48:54] <arthurvr> exactly what robert said. Please provide a testcase :)
[12:49:00] <rembol> So I imported jQuery in my java page but I'm getting the following error: '$body is undefined'
[12:49:06] <sadtaco> I can't test case 6,000 lines of code
[12:49:09] <robertmaxrees> "java page" rembol?
[12:49:18] <robertmaxrees> sadtaco how would you like us to help, then?
[12:49:24] <sadtaco> No... but how can $('.select').closest('.statements'); only select 2 of 6 elements with .statements i can clearly see 6 elements on the page with that class?
[12:49:48] <robertmaxrees> sadtaco invalid markup, only two .select elements...
[12:50:01] <rembol> Yeah so I created a DOM class and imported jQuery to my java page, compiled, but it seems like it throws errors. I'm new to IRC, java and jQuery sorry
[12:50:01] <sadtaco> They have the exact same markup
[12:50:13] <arthurvr> rembol: wait wait wait
[12:50:21] <sadtaco> literally 100% exactly the same since they were all generated from the same function.
[12:50:25] <robertmaxrees> sadtaco try $('.select').length
[12:50:25] <arthurvr> I think you’re confusing some things :p
[12:50:42] <robertmaxrees> and $('.statements').length
[12:50:57] <sadtaco> Oh oops yeah nevermind that one works fine.
[12:51:05] <rembol> how can I know turn it into javascript? I'm new to java sorry.
[12:51:14] <sadtaco> There's many statements but only a few with a .select.
[12:51:20] <robertmaxrees> rembol java and javascript have nothing to do with one another.
[12:51:24] <arthurvr> rembol: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript#JavaScript_and_Java
[12:51:26] <robertmaxrees> ^
[12:51:54] <rembol> so I got told to use jQuery I should thus be looking into java and don't compile it to javascript
[12:52:06] <arthurvr> http://learn.jquery.com/about-jquery/
[12:52:19] <arthurvr> you miss some basic understanding of what javascript and jquery are.
[12:52:24] <robertmaxrees> rembol you don't compile javascript
[12:52:30] <robertmaxrees> you just include it on the page.
[12:52:36] <rembol> the jar file?
[12:52:44] <robertmaxrees> there is no jar file for javascript/jquery
[12:52:58] <rembol> I will read that page arthurvf
[12:53:04] <rembol> s/vf/vr
[12:53:39] <sadtaco> Javascript is JIT compiled on a VM.
[12:53:46] <rembol> so I don't need to create those DOM classes too then?
[12:53:55] <robertmaxrees> rembol "dom classes"?
[12:54:04] <robertmaxrees> rembol i think you need to do a basic course on HTML and javascript :)
[12:54:12] <rembol> class DOM {} which jQuery manipulates?
[12:54:16] <rembol> I'll do that
[12:54:18] <rembol> thanks
[12:54:20] <robertmaxrees> jquery doesn't touch that.
[12:54:30] <robertmaxrees> jquery modifies the DOM through the browser.
[12:54:33] <robertmaxrees> not the code from java
[12:54:44] <arthurvr> was this somebody laughing with us or actually serious? lol
[12:54:52] <garethdaine> NoiseEee: Got it sorted now thanks http://kopy.io/KwUXb Much appreciated
[12:54:53] <robertmaxrees> probably serious.
[12:54:57] <arthurvr> my god
[12:55:04] <robertmaxrees> you'd be surprised.
[12:55:19] <arthurvr> guess so. lol
[12:55:20] <sadtaco> It's weird to have experience with Java, but be unable to even google for the wikipedia page for Javascript as a bare minimum
[12:55:42] <robertmaxrees> sadtaco people see it's a langauge and it says "java" in it and make assumptions.
[12:56:03] <arthurvr> and if you didn’t know it, you probably would make  that connection in some way too right?
[12:56:05] <sadtaco> Before I used Java, I knew it wasn't at all related to the JS I knew...
[12:56:17] <sadtaco> I understand people that put those together that have no experience with either or programmer.
[12:56:19] <sadtaco> programming*
[12:56:25] <arthurvr> exactly ^
[12:56:37] <robertmaxrees> plenty of devs have that confusion, too.
[12:56:51] <sadtaco> It's weird that he had experience with Java but thought Javascript was related.
[12:56:52] <arthurvr> Yeah it’s pretty obvious that there’s confusion about this.
[12:57:01] <arthurvr> though I thought it was kinda gone these days
[12:57:02] <arthurvr> lol
[12:57:05] <sadtaco> It's are fault for not calling it ECMAScript
[12:57:10] <sadtaco> our*
[12:57:14] <robertmaxrees> eeehhh.
[12:57:18] <robertmaxrees> that would convolute it more imo.
[12:57:33] <arthurvr> actually that would probably confuse more people lolz
[12:57:47] <sadtaco> Oh robertmaxrees i forgot a very important thing about my problem
[12:57:59] <sadtaco> Chrome debugger, in the CSS section, doesn't "see" these classes either
[12:58:05] <NoiseEee> np garethdaine :)
[12:58:13] <robertmaxrees> sadtaco that sounds like a validity issue then.
[12:58:24] <robertmt> haha java
[12:58:29] <sadtaco> If I try to style that constructorFn class, it's grey.
[12:58:31] <robertmt> kinda crazy
[12:58:33] <sadtaco> Hmmm...
[12:58:36] <robertmt> java guys...
[12:58:45] <robertmaxrees> what about java?
[12:58:46] <sadtaco> is constructorFn a bad class name, then? o_O
[12:58:56] <robertmaxrees> sadtaco that's not what i said ;)
[12:59:00] <sadtaco> Is chrome forcing lowercase classes or something?
[12:59:03] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[12:59:04] <robertmt> robertmaxrees: class DOM {}
[12:59:08] <sadtaco> What could it be to be invalid then?
[12:59:09] <robertmaxrees> pass the site through the w3c's validator.
[12:59:30] <robertmaxrees> sadtaco since we don't have the site in front of us, there's no real way we can help.
[12:59:36] <robertmt> I though W3C validator wasn't a valid tool anymore
[12:59:40] <robertmaxrees> wut
[12:59:49] <robertmaxrees> according to whom?
[12:59:52] <arthurvr> it is not really modern anymore but actually still catches problems like this
[12:59:57] <robertmaxrees> ^
[13:00:12] <arthurvr> I don’t think HTML5 boilerplate even passes lol
[13:00:31] <robertmaxrees> very few things pass, but having lots of critical errors is a big sign
[13:00:40] <arthurvr> yep ^
[13:00:52] <robertmaxrees> misplaced/extra closing body tags, no doctype, etc.
[13:01:26] <arthurvr> there are cool grunt tasks out there that actually do a better job at validation but the only W3C one catches the most important things
[13:01:42] <robertmaxrees> aye - it's a good starting point.
[13:02:01] <robertmt> thanks for the informationals
[13:03:28] <sadtaco> Oh wow robertmaxrees
[13:03:29] <sadtaco> that was it
[13:03:36] <sadtaco> I had a bad doctype set and bad meta tag
[13:03:40] <robertmaxrees> :)
[13:19:29] <graphettion> Can anyone help me out getting the HTML 5 audio player to toggle pause and play? The toggling works but it restarts the audio instead of pausing it. - https://jsfiddle.net/stff5ko3/1/
[13:20:05] <colt45> what song is it playing?
[13:21:49] <graphettion> colt45 : No song, just an old radio talk show
[13:21:59] <colt45> yeah im listening now
[13:22:09] <graphettion> lol
[13:22:20] <colt45> ahahahah fml
[13:22:47] <colt45> i think ernest hemingway is coming on next
[13:27:12] <CocoStorm> Hey guys, I believe this image gallery plugin uses different files for the same images - the difference being the size (width and height).  I'm trying to use this plugin but I'm hosting my images from my web server.. Surely I shouldn't have to go through the hassle of resizing images before uploading - it's also a huge waste of space and money.  Is there a work around? Maybe just resize it on the fly using width, height attributes?
[13:27:12] <CocoStorm> http://tympanus.net/codrops/2012/11/06/gamma-gallery-a-responsive-image-gallery-experiment
[13:33:03] <garethdaine> Is there a way to get all data attrbute values for a specific element type
[13:33:13] <garethdaine> Possibly to json format
[13:34:31] <robertmaxrees> garethdaine https://api.jquery.com/data/#data
[13:35:44] <robertmaxrees> "Calling .data() with no parameters retrieves all of the values as a JavaScript object. This object can be safely cached in a variable as long as a new object is not set with .data(obj). Using the object directly to get or set values is faster than making individual calls to .data() to get or set each value:"
[13:36:23] <garethdaine> Thanks robertmaxrees: Cheers, was just looking at that
[13:36:31] <robertmaxrees> :)
[13:45:40] <robertmaxrees> CocoStorm storage is cheap and preferred in this case - don't make your users download huge images unless they need the,
[13:56:15] <arc_> i'm kind of confused how it's a waste of money
[13:56:24] <arc_> it will save you money if you are paying for bandwidth
[13:57:29] <arc_> potentially quite a lot of money, depending on the size of your full size images and traffic
[13:57:55] <arc_> also it should be pretty easy to make a photoshop droplet that automatically creates the required sizes
[13:58:30] <robertmaxrees> arc_ caching makes the bandwidth thing even less of an issue :)
[13:58:46] <colt45> robertmaxrees you're so underappreciated
[13:58:53] <arc_> how do you mean
[13:58:54] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[13:59:26] <robertmaxrees> arc_ the browser won't download the images each time the user visits the page - usually only the first one.
[13:59:36] <arc_> well yeah
[13:59:38] <colt45> you're just always here helping people out, in such a poignant manner. the psychology to that i find interesting but moreover its very much unappreciated
[13:59:49] <arc_> it just depends on if he has the same users over and over, or a lot of one time users
[14:00:04] <robertmaxrees> arc_ yeah, but it's a good tradeoff imo
[14:00:05] <robertmaxrees> colt45 i appreciate that.
[14:00:18] <robertmaxrees> i learn through doing this.  makes me a better programmer.
[14:26:16] <SoItBegins> So I have a quandary.
[14:26:22] <SoItBegins> I have jQuery running inside of an iFrame.
[14:26:33] <robertmaxrees> iframes aren't apple products btw ;)
[14:26:41] <SoItBegins> mybad.
[14:26:51] <SoItBegins> I'm trying to lock onto a div in the area outside the iframe, so, I tried:
[14:27:04] <SoItBegins> $("body",parent) .
[14:27:13] <SoItBegins> $("body") gets the iframe's <body>.
[14:27:21] <SoItBegins> $("body",parent) freezes the page.
[14:27:23] <SoItBegins> What's going wrong?
[14:27:40] <androoid> didn't know you can do that
[14:28:06] <robertmaxrees> try $('body', window.parent.document);
[14:28:10] <robertmaxrees> and yeah, you can.
[14:32:23] <SoItBegins> Same result.
[14:32:26] <new0> #teck
[14:32:41] <new0> sorry mitake
[14:33:24] <new0> looking for a channel that solve the problem of: virus lock the laptop bios with password
[14:34:25] <SoItBegins> new0: you may have to open up your laptop and do something with the hardware. But this isn't the channel. Try asking in ##windows - they'll at least point you in the right direction.
[14:34:39] <AcidBeard> Pull the CMPOS battery
[14:34:43] <AcidBeard> CMOS*
[14:34:50] <AcidBeard> THast usually will do the trick
[14:34:59] <AcidBeard> THAT* I CANT EFFIN TYPE TODAY
[14:35:21] <SoItBegins> One thing I probs should have mentioned at this point is that the jQuery instance I'm using is loaded by the Xkit browser extension, so it runs with its starting context inside the iframe in question.
[14:35:36] <SoItBegins> I'm not sure if that changes anything, but I thought it would be relevant.
[14:35:52] <new0> SoItBegins, tnx
[14:44:40] <SoItBegins> When I try running $("body",window.parent) in the console, it just gives me the <body> of the iframe, not its parent.
[14:45:07] <SoItBegins> And when I try $("body",window.parent.document) in the console, I get a permission denied error.
[14:45:53] <robertmaxrees> SoItBegins sounds like a CORS issue maybe?
[14:46:04] <SoItBegins> It sounds like that is what it is.
[14:46:39] <SoItBegins> For context, the project is Xkit, a tumblr-augmenting extension; the iframe is www.tumblr.com/[...] and hosts the tumblr buttons, while the parent frame is [another subdomain].tumblr.com and hosts the content.
[14:46:53] <SoItBegins> Previously it was different, but it looks like tumblr changed it recently and that's why things broke.
[14:46:57] <robertmaxrees> yeah, port, protocol, domain, and subdomain must match.
[14:47:46] <SoItBegins> Hmm. Which begs the question… 'now what'?
[14:48:19] <robertmaxrees> without modifying your browser is a very unsafe way, nothing.
[14:48:26] <robertmaxrees> what does this extension to?
[14:49:04] <SoItBegins> http://xkit.info/
[14:49:10] <SoItBegins> Xkit is like greasemonkey for tumblr.
[14:49:24] <robertmaxrees> lol okay.
[14:49:34] <robertmaxrees> sorry, i'm at work and don't really have time to read the entire site.
[14:49:37] <SoItBegins> Its normal maintainer is… um… taking a break from development.
[14:50:56] <SoItBegins> And certain features— like the one that lets you save tumblr posts to a localStorage archive— have broken.
[14:51:26] <SoItBegins> So I got curious and started investigating.
[15:00:02] <SoItBegins> Hey, haaaang on a minute.
[15:00:34] <SoItBegins> What I've read about CORS seems to be in response to making a request, like a GET or whatever.
[15:00:42] <SoItBegins> It doesn't say anything about iframe-to-parent communication.
[15:11:52] <SoItBegins> Hey wait a minute!
[15:12:00] <SoItBegins> wait nvm
[15:17:29] <tfittsy> I'm dealing with a bootstrap specific issue but that channel is pretty dead.  I have a link that is supposed to load into a modal, the link code is identical to other links that are loaded through ajax that work, but anytime I click the links they are refreshing the whole window instead of loading a modal.  The links are being created as part of a HighCharts chart.  When I load the 2 similar
[15:17:29] <tfittsy> links in jQuery Audit they look similar as far as I can tell except the one that doesn't work has Internal Data: "@(none)" whereas the working one has Internal Data: object, and the object hasDataAttrs: true
[15:20:35] <acidjazz> ugh bootstrap
[15:20:45] <tfittsy> I know, it's the worst, right?
[15:20:54] <tfittsy> who uses it anyway.
[15:21:06] <AcidBeard> You, apparently.  XD
[15:21:21] <tfittsy> I know, but like, hardly anyone else.
[15:22:50] <kevireilly> tfittsy: generally sounds link an anchor or form action that isn't being preventDefault'd
[15:23:47] <AcidBeard> ...that's sarcasm, right, because a shit-ton of people us it
[15:24:06] <kevireilly> he forgot to wrap it in <sarcasm> tags
[15:24:13] <kevireilly> *they
[15:34:05] <tfittsy> AcidBeard: I figured it was so obvious I didn't need the tags
[15:35:34] <AcidBeard> I figured but you can never be too sure when interacting with people online
[15:36:08] <tfittsy> kevireilly: I'm pretty sure it has something to do with highcharts preventing the binding.  If I copy the element from where it is in the highchart and paste it into a separate part on the page then it works property, so I'll look into wtf highcharts could be doing.
[15:36:43] <bango> i've got datatables set up on a page that loads a long list of entities, which have a blob that i decompress into a prettified textarea using codemirror.
[15:36:47] <tfittsy> the text of the link anyway, not the element itself
[15:37:10] <bango> codemirror takes a bit of time to invoke each instance, and i dont want to be invoking all of them on page load, i want them invoked as the user paginates
[15:37:49] <bango> but i dont want them to re-invoke if theyve already been invoked, or ill get a console error which i could suppress but i just dont want to do that
[15:38:25] <bango> i thought, i could build an array of pages visited, and check if new page is in that array before calling codemirror on all those textareas, but im open to better suggestions
[15:38:45] <tfittsy> bango: can't you fire it on the page change event and add a class after the element has been codemirrored up so it doesn't call it on that again?
[15:39:12] <bango> so 2 objects called for each, but it will only be called on paginate
[15:39:36] <bango> which is along the lines of what i was saying
[15:39:48] <bango> but you say an object that says ive already been initiated?
[15:40:32] <tfittsy> yeah, doesn't codemirror add a class to an element that it has prettified?
[15:41:07] <tfittsy> so can't you just select the elements you want to codemirror - the ones that have already been codemirrored? The page change event will still fire every time but it will only do them once?
[15:41:23] <tfittsy> s/-/minus
[15:41:23] <bango> im not even sure, but i know it has destroy functions and all that, maybe it has that simple bool functionality, would be practical
[15:41:57] <bango> ill do some digging, thanks for input tfittsy
[15:52:53] <colt45> sup markholmes
[15:54:41] <colt45> robert
[15:59:46] <robertmaxrees> sup?
[16:00:02] <colt45> can jquery do calculus
[16:00:08] <robertmaxrees> wut
[16:00:19] <robertmaxrees> jquery is a DOM abstraction library with some extras in it.
[16:00:20] <colt45> can JS do calculus
[16:00:47] <robertmaxrees> i don't see why not.
[16:00:58] <colt45> i have some apprehensions but i like your attitude
[16:01:13] <robertmaxrees> programming is all basically lambda calculus anyway sooo
[16:01:40] <colt45> what math is responsible for JS core library, what is the inner most base mathematical sequence of JS?
[16:01:42] <robertmaxrees> i wouldn't rely on floating-point precision, but otherwise it's feasible.
[16:01:49] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[16:01:55] <colt45> whats the math behind JS
[16:02:03] <robertmaxrees> "the math behind js"?
[16:02:21] <colt45> yes
[16:02:29] <colt45> what kind of math is running JS
[16:02:36] <robertmaxrees> that doesn't make any sense.
[16:02:52] <robertmaxrees> "running js" is ephemeral - different browsers do it different ways.
[16:03:23] <colt45> I dont think its ephemeral
[16:03:34] <markholmes> the math behind js is whatever you tell js to compute
[16:03:37] <robertmaxrees> ^
[16:03:46] <robertmaxrees> what are you actually trying to figure out?
[16:04:03] <markholmes> it can add, subtract, multiply, and divide
[16:04:11] <robertmaxrees> are you trying to figure out how to write a programming language?  or what math you need to know to do something like that?
[16:04:12] <markholmes> amongst other math-y things
[16:04:12] <colt45> yes,  but can it do calc
[16:04:37] <colt45> im just kind of flying around right now, assessing the situation curious about the epicenter of the math behind JS
[16:04:45] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[16:04:57] <colt45> what math is responsible for making JS work
[16:05:03] <markholmes> what are you talking about
[16:05:10] <robertmaxrees> yeah that questiuon doesn't really make sense.
[16:05:19] <colt45> what is the underbelly of JS
[16:05:30] <robertmaxrees> the ecmascript spec
[16:05:52] <robertmaxrees> there are engines that run js for you.  spidermonkey and v8 are two examples.
[16:06:01] <robertmaxrees> chakra is another one.
[16:06:04] <markholmes> can you compare what you think javascript is to another programming language that you do know, so I can try understand what information you're looking for?
[16:06:27] <markholmes> is this like a ruby is to rails what javascript is to jquery kind of thing, or?
[16:06:41] <colt45> no, im not that retarded
[16:06:52] <wuteva> http://jsfiddle.net/tevah2qc/
[16:07:16] <markholmes> allllright
[16:07:48] <colt45> i was just curious of the raw cs behind js and what kind of mathematical foundation it was using, to even begin doing multiply subtraction etc
[16:08:00] <decx> i went over my bandwidthlimit just receiving all these var
[16:08:35] <robertmaxrees> colt45 that's not really how it works.
[16:08:51] <colt45> how does it work
[16:08:59] <wuteva> I'm trying to iterate over a series of arrays of jquery objects, how do I apply a jquery function to the loop winningCombinations[i][j]?
[16:09:13] <robertmaxrees> colt45 https://github.com/v8/v8-git-mirror
[16:09:27] <robertmaxrees> https://developers.google.com/v8/intro
[16:09:33] <robertmaxrees> this is one engine for javascript.
[16:09:43] <colt45> js is just some weirdo inversion of c
[16:09:48] <robertmaxrees> not really.
[16:09:59] <colt45> it has to have some base commonality
[16:10:04] <colt45> of essentially the same fucking thing
[16:10:06] <robertmaxrees> in syntax, maybe.
[16:10:12] <robertmaxrees> but very different languages.
[16:10:52] <robertmaxrees> winningCombinations.forEach(function(currentArray) { currentArray.forEach(currentObject) {console.log(currentObject} }); <- wuteva
[16:10:54] <colt45> your not getting my questioning
[16:11:02] <robertmaxrees> colt45 apparentyl not.
[16:11:14] <colt45> well i would like to fix that
[16:13:17] <robertmaxrees> are you trying to figure out how the language basically works?  how it knows what to do with things like '2 + 2'
[16:14:23] <colt45> ok when JS is being processed its being processed off of the browsers base- C compiler, sort of?
[16:14:29] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[16:14:49] <robertmaxrees> there's an engine that was written that reads the code that handles it.
[16:15:07] <colt45> what is the engine written in
[16:15:24] <robertmaxrees> that is irrelevant to the end result, but iut could be written in all sorts of languages.
[16:15:49] <robertmaxrees> V8 is c++  iirc.
[16:16:37] <colt45> do you know c++ cold?
[16:16:43] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[16:19:29] <SoItBegins> colt45: what exactly are you trying to do?
[16:20:30] <robertmaxrees> they're getting their answerrs in #web
[16:20:45] <wuteva> In 'function(currentArray) { currentArray.forEach(currentObject) {console.log(currentObject} }'
[16:21:52] <wuteva> Would I plug in i for 'currentArray' and j for 'currentObject'?
[16:22:23] <robertmaxrees> i wouldn't.
[16:22:31] <robertmaxrees> that's how you enumerate over all of them.
[16:23:18] <wuteva> Then how would I loop through each array and then each object to check for its class?
[16:23:32] <robertmaxrees> ^ what i showed you.
[16:24:25] <wuteva> I'm not very good with OOP--I can't grasp what currentArray and currentObject refer to
[16:24:41] <robertmaxrees> that's more functional :)
[16:24:42] <robertmaxrees> one sec.
[16:24:54] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/sr690vpg/
[16:24:57] <wuteva> Okay, awesome-thanks
[16:25:11] <robertmaxrees> myArrays.forEach() - this enumerates over each of the arrays in myArrays
[16:25:35] <robertmaxrees> so myArrays.forEach(function(currentArray) {}); - "currentArray" is a reference to the "current" array.
[16:25:47] <wuteva> Okay, I see
[16:26:17] <robertmaxrees> make sense now?
[16:28:05] <wuteva> Yeah, I think so--the first forEach grabs each array like an initial loop and the second one acts like a second for loop to grab each object inside of the array
[16:28:16] <robertmaxrees> yeah, except they're not for loops.
[16:28:23] <robertmaxrees> they're better.
[16:29:19] <wuteva> Lol, I'm guessing they have more intelligent functionality
[16:29:48] <robertmaxrees> for loops are roundabout ways to iterate over things - you're actually doing some counting and other stuff.  forEach() is nice because it's more descriptive of what you want.
[16:30:23] <wuteva> I see, awesome, thank you!
[16:30:31] <robertmaxrees> deffo
[16:34:33] <Sal> hi
[16:35:15] <Sal> is there a way to pass a parametere to the "success:onLoadData" of ajax?
[16:39:59] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[16:44:05] <wuteva> http://jsfiddle.net/tevah2qc/1/
[16:44:35] <wuteva> I tried the method, but for some reason, when applying hasClass, it returns false for any value passed in
[16:44:37] <wuteva> Why is that?
[16:45:18] <rcyr> remove the dots
[16:45:21] <wuteva> I mean I was playing around with breakpoints in chrome console
[16:45:56] <wuteva> Lol fuck.. fffuuuuck.. that worked, thank you
[16:45:58] <rcyr> :)
[16:46:14] <wuteva> Why though? I thought in jquery you had to reference classes with a . at the beginning
[16:46:25] <rcyr> For selectors
[16:46:33] <rcyr> That function wants a class name
[16:46:42] <rcyr> adding the . would be redundant.
[16:46:46] <wuteva> I see, awesome!
[16:46:54] <rcyr> You could also have used .us('.green')
[16:46:56] <rcyr> Err
[16:47:01] <wuteva> .us?
[16:47:02] <rcyr>  .is('.green')
[16:47:05] <rcyr> Typo
[16:47:10] <wuteva> Okay lol
[16:47:18] <wuteva> I haven't used that method before
[17:44:31] <sagerdearia> How can I detect when a text input element is created in a web page after the page finishes loading and to auto set the value as soon as it is created?
[17:47:08] <sagerdearia> Years ago I wrote some event handler code that affected elements that were created after page loaded, but I do not remember what the jQuery event handler was called.
[17:48:40] <sagerdearia> mm, maybe http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21239210/jquery-event-not-triggering-for-dom-elements-created-after-page-load
[17:48:52] <sagerdearia> http://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/
[17:49:02] <AcidBeard> I usually make a rebind() function
[17:49:36] <AcidBeard> And any elements I anticipate on chnging I put in there.
[17:57:34] <AcidBeard> Like this: http://jsfiddle.net/xLcj8d0v/
[18:03:34] <sagerdearia> This seems simple enough instead: $('div#edit-uc-product-image').on('click', 'div.image-widget-data input.form-text', function() { $(this).val($('input#edit-title').val()); });
[18:04:03] <sagerdearia> but I wonder if there is an event that triggers when an element is created
[18:04:25] <sagerdearia> maybe 'ready'
[18:05:18] <sagerdearia> nope
[18:06:15] <sagerdearia> nor 'load'
[18:11:14] <AcidBeard> You could add a listener to the container the input is added to
[18:11:27] <AcidBeard> Like $("#wrapper").change()
[18:28:21] <ceramicskulls> Does anybody here use optimizely?

[21:03:45] <AcidRain2012> is jquery injection possible?
[21:04:28] <AcidRain2012> how do functions that have user input passed to them prevent the user from breaking a jquery line, opening a new clean line, injecting code (for example, cookie theft)
[21:08:15] <Robdgreat> what do you mean, breaking a jquery line
[21:08:19] <Robdgreat> eval() is bad.
[21:08:30] <Robdgreat> don't use it
[21:08:34] <AcidBeard> That's just javascript injection
[21:08:48] <AcidRain2012> hmmm. let me think of an example.
[21:08:53] <AcidRain2012> AcidBeard: u see what im saying?
[21:10:17] <Robdgreat> I'd love an example
[21:10:29] <Robdgreat> if you could provide one
[21:10:31] <AcidBeard> I would also like one.  >_>
[21:10:42] <AcidBeard> The only danger I see would be XSS
[21:10:45] <AcidRain2012> i cant think of anything to show an example on
[21:10:52] <AcidRain2012> ye im talking about xss
[21:11:17] <Robdgreat> I don't understand how you would break out of jquery and inject arbitrary code
[21:11:23] <AcidBeard> That usually requires the attacker to be able to get some code into the page that will run for another user
[21:12:06] <AcidBeard> Otherwise, the console would be very dangerous
[21:12:24] <AcidBeard> And Greasemonkey would be as well
[21:12:31] <snover> https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cross-site_Scripting_%28XSS%29#Examples
[21:16:42] <AcidRain2012> AcidBeard: http://jsfiddle.net/8yad7qza/   i also tried to inject ').val(); alert("1"); with no success. i dont see how jquery stops this injection from being successful
[21:18:09] <AcidBeard> But that is purely on the side of the user
[21:18:21] <AcidBeard> Who cares if they dump their own session var
[21:18:54] <AcidRain2012> given the right way this code is used, someone could easily send that off to another server
[21:19:21] <AcidBeard> Yep, and that's why everything should be cleaned server-side
[21:19:36] <AcidRain2012> jquery is client side only :/
[21:20:37] <AcidBeard> ...yep...all Javascript is...so, let's say the user sends something like <script>//Bad Stuff Here</script>
[21:21:07] <AcidBeard> That doesn't matter until a different user leads that data.
[21:21:24] <AcidBeard> The only way they are going to load that data is pull it from the server.
[21:21:40] <AcidBeard> You can't send that directly to another user
[21:23:15] <Robdgreat> AcidBeard: your test case just has invalid html. the value of the input is "\" and then there's what amounts to garbage
[21:23:57] <AcidBeard> ...?  What test case?
[21:24:06] <AcidBeard> Wrong Acid, perhaps?
[21:24:45] <Robdgreat> yes.
[21:24:47] <Robdgreat> AcidRain2012:
[21:24:54] <Robdgreat> http://jsfiddle.net/8yad7qza/1/
[21:25:35] <AcidRain2012> lol. ignore the syntax of my vector. its the concept and the fact
[21:25:48] <Robdgreat> but it didn't work.
[21:25:52] <AcidBeard> You can run anything you want in the console
[21:25:57] <AcidRain2012> :/ doesnt have to work
[21:26:02] <Robdgreat> yes it does
[21:26:06] <Robdgreat> or your argument is invalid
[21:26:06] <AcidRain2012> -.-
[21:26:09] <AcidRain2012> yall are missing the point
[21:26:31] <AcidRain2012> omg hang on
[21:26:41] <AcidBeard> No, I don't think you understand XSS
[21:27:01] <AcidRain2012> bro ive written 100s of articles in depth on xss
[21:27:10] <Robdgreat> if you cant produce a working proof of concept, there's no evidence that your issue is valid
[21:27:16] <AcidRain2012> im talking about jquery ONLY
[21:27:39] <Robdgreat> my update to your fiddle produces an alert
[21:28:01] <AcidRain2012> cool. that doesnt count tho. cause it hasnt proven my argument
[21:28:01] <AcidRain2012> lol
[21:28:07] <AcidBeard> ...
[21:28:15] <Robdgreat> it's not my job to prove your argument
[21:28:20] <AcidBeard> I'm not sure what your argument is
[21:28:30] <AcidRain2012> not your job to tell me what my argument is either. lol
[21:28:56] <Robdgreat> one of us has to
[21:29:00] <Robdgreat> you're not doing a very good job of it
[21:29:08] <snover> does this argument have a positive conclusion?
[21:29:12] <AcidRain2012> go look at it, do not inject js. inject jquery. why does it not work if you inject: ').val(); alert(haxhere); //
[21:29:25] <Robdgreat> why should it?
[21:29:40] <Robdgreat> hint: jquery is js
[21:30:06] <AcidRain2012> =/ why should it? nvm
[21:30:15] <AcidBeard> jQuery is no more vulnerable to XSS than vanilla JS
[21:30:32] <AcidRain2012> lol. k thank you!
[21:30:41] <AcidRain2012> now, what type of preventions do we have?
[21:31:10] <Robdgreat> you have yet to produce a working exploit to show that vulnerability is the default state
[21:31:13] <AcidBeard> You are confusing the shit out of me
[21:31:38] <AcidRain2012> <AcidRain2012> how do functions that have user input passed to them prevent the user from breaking a jquery line, opening a new clean line, injecting code (for example, cookie theft)
[21:31:44] <AcidRain2012> talking about jquery. not vanilla js
[21:31:53] <AcidRain2012> nvm bro. i got to go
[21:31:58] <Robdgreat> does this work in vanilla js?
[21:32:04] <Robdgreat> is that why you're making the distinction?
[21:32:07] <Robdgreat> oh ok
[21:32:08] <Robdgreat> bye
[21:32:45] <AcidBeard> Why does it matter?  You have complete control over the JS in the console?
[21:33:01] <Robdgreat> there's no reason to assume that jquery automatically introduces some magical vulnerability
[21:33:10] <AcidBeard> How can you stal someones cookie without getting the person to execute the script?
[21:33:12] <Robdgreat> that isn't present in the language to begin with
[21:33:46] <Robdgreat> sometimes the reason something doesn't happen is because it isn't possible
[21:34:08] <Robdgreat> why doesn't the sun go west to east on Tuesdays, guys?
[21:34:26] <AcidBeard> Am i missing something or does what he said make no sense..?
[21:34:34] <Robdgreat> "does it do it any other day?" not talking about other days! Talking about Tuesdays!
[21:34:54] <Robdgreat> that's basically the type of argument I was reading
[21:35:23] <AcidBeard> I want to read his articles on XSS
[21:35:31] <Robdgreat> one of the hundreds of them
[21:35:34] <Robdgreat> yeah me too

[23:05:44] <jak2000> hi all, wich is better for submit a form, do a submit with a Jquery, or simple: <input type="submit" ?
[23:13:47] <Cork> jak2000: one doesn't exclude the other
[23:14:12] <Cork> jak2000: a form should always have a submit button, though i would recommend using <button></button> instead of <input type="submit>
[23:32:05] <spread> I am using datatables.  I have a simple table with 4 columns.  I am retrieving 5 fields from the DB and want to use the fifth field as a badge in the forth field.  How is is possible to send a 5th column to the datatable and use it together in another column
[23:35:05] <jak2000> then you recommend od the submitting with jQuery?
