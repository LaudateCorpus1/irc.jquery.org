[06:51:38] <grid-> hey
[06:51:40] <grid-> https://jsfiddle.net/utLmna7f/
[06:51:52] <grid-> is there a reason why the handler isn't working?
[06:52:24] <grid-> it should call alert(); once the selectbox is being used with a choice, the selectbox in the editor
[07:10:14] <Uhkis> probably because there's no element with the id status
[08:35:04] <grid-> Uhkis: i switched from debugging place
[08:35:09] <grid-> Uhkis: http://live.datatables.net/cezigire/1/edit
[08:35:30] <grid-> locally the change event works on my computer, why not at that debug?
[08:35:43] <grid->   $("#DTE_Field_office").on("change", function() {
[08:36:12] <grid-> it's the office in the editor window
[08:38:58] <Cork> grid-: the popup is dynamically generated
[08:39:05] <Cork> it doesn't exist when you try to bind to it
[08:39:27] <Cork> simplest solution is to delegate the event listener to a static parent
[08:39:40] <Cork> grid-: https://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/
[08:41:28] <grid-> Cork: however this is the case, it will work on my own webserver
[08:41:50] <grid-> if i create an editor instance window it will trigger when the select is being changed
[08:45:58] <grid-> Cork: the button create is static, but this also doesn't work:   $(".dt-button buttons-create").on('click', function(event){
[08:45:58] <grid->     alert("Hello world");
[08:45:58] <grid->   } );
[08:50:24] <Cork> cause it doesn't have the class create
[08:50:36] <Cork> so dt-button would work
[08:51:54] <grid->   $(".dt-buttons").on('click', function(){
[08:51:54] <grid-> yes
[08:52:10] <Cork> grid-: check in the dom so you see what classes you have there
[08:53:01] <grid-> Cork: you got an idea howto trigger when the select is being changed?
[08:53:26] <Cork> grid-: you have to bind the event to a static parent, and listen for events from the dynamic select element
[08:55:33] <grid-> i pointed to this https://datatables.net/forums/discussion/35000/how-to-catch-onchange-event
[08:57:32] <grid-> Uncaught Unknown field name - #DTE_Field_office
[08:57:46] <Cork> ...
[08:58:10] <Cork> grid-: ya, cause like i've told you three times, it is dynamically generated so you can't selecit where you are
[08:58:24] <Cork> you have to bind it as a delegated event handler to a static parent
[09:00:02] <grid-> yes, i don't have the knowledge howto do that
[09:00:32] <Cork> see the link i gave you 20 mins ago
[10:52:24] <Kristjan1291983> I have a bug in circle clicking function
[10:52:36] <Kristjan1291983> What am I talking about:
[10:52:46] <Kristjan1291983> gameofclicks.getenjoyment.net
[10:53:05] <thykka> doesn't load
[10:53:09] <Kristjan1291983> It seems not to click very accurately
[10:53:16] <thykka> oh.. http
[10:54:50] <Kristjan1291983> yes
[10:55:42] <thykka> have you checked that the coordinates are calculated correctly_
[10:56:16] <thykka> i.e. logging the calculated X & Y when clicking at the top left and bottom right corners of the canvas, and verifying the result makes sense_
[10:56:18] <thykka> ?
[10:56:45] <thykka> also, this question isn't specific to jQuery, so you can ask at ##javascript
[10:57:16] <Kristjan1291983> Near the c.addEventListener('click', function(event) {
[10:57:19] <Kristjan1291983> Yes
[10:57:36] <Kristjan1291983> It is a little bit more dealing with javascript strictly
[10:57:51] <Kristjan1291983> But It is inside a jquery function
[10:58:02] <Kristjan1291983> 	 var ev_x=event.pageX-offsetX-6;
[10:58:02] <Kristjan1291983> 	 var ev_y=event.pageY-offsetY-6;
[10:58:13] <thykka> it's not inside a jquery function even :)
[10:58:24] <thykka> that's a regular event listenere
[10:58:27] <thykka> -e
[10:58:29] <Kristjan1291983> these are the lines, that are "jinky-pinky"
[10:58:37] <thykka> why the -6?
[10:58:40] <Kristjan1291983> yes
[10:59:00] <Kristjan1291983> It is my own estimation, to get the click inside a circle
[10:59:08] <Kristjan1291983> "about right"
[10:59:25] <Kristjan1291983> maybe it should be more like -7.5 and -7.5
[10:59:38] <Kristjan1291983> because the circle diameter is 15 pixels
[11:00:17] <thykka> but you're already doing the radius check
[11:00:35] <thykka> no wait.. not in that function..
[11:02:09] <Kristjan1291983> I think I don't fully understand the pageX and offsetX and these things
[11:03:05] <thykka> see the 2nd answer: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6073505/what-is-the-difference-between-screenx-y-clientx-y-and-pagex-y
[11:03:56] <thykka> if you're using clientX/Y for clicking something on the page, you probably need to take scrolling into account as well
[11:05:38] <Kristjan1291983> I think there could be also something wrong with clicking strenght.... Sometimes I have to click 2 times
[11:05:55] <Kristjan1291983> Instead of one, to get the circle opt out
[11:07:53] <Kristjan1291983> On my full strenght play I get almost perfect score 33/34, but I have to click like insane
[11:10:18] <Kristjan1291983> What do you people think of the game ?
[11:25:37] <relipse> how do I do this in vanilla javascript: $('section.table').toggle();
[11:30:12] <shoky> relipse: document.querySelector('section.table').classList.toggle('hidden');    and have a `hidden` class in your css
[11:30:56] <thykka> jQuery might actually add/remove inline styles.. using classes is better though
[11:31:23] <shoky> yes, obviously if you want exactly what jquery does, use jquery
[11:32:10] <thykka> a vanilla inline style version could look like this: https://jsfiddle.net/2y0te6ok/
[15:31:26] <Aljone> hey guys, anyone can recognize this image gallery https://prestige-theme-couture.myshopify.com/collections/new-arrivals/products/edie-cascade-wrap-mini-dress-dusty-blue
[15:32:10] <Aljone> i cant find which plugin is used
[15:32:44] <robertmaxrees> looks like something build by shopify
[15:33:56] <robertmaxrees> *built
[15:34:43] <robertmaxrees> https://flickity.metafizzy.co/ Aljone this one.
[15:34:54] <robertmaxrees> no idea how customized it is or w/e
[15:35:04] <Cork> yup https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0011/9242/7564/t/8/assets/libs.min.js
[15:37:30] <Aljone> https://flickity.metafizzy.co/ < but i cant find the horizontal one
[15:37:46] <robertmaxrees> see prior comment: "no idea how customized it is or w/e"
[15:37:52] <robertmaxrees> but it is flickity :)
[15:37:54] <Aljone> ohh
[15:40:44] <robertmaxrees> also: it's kinda rude to shotgun a question out to multiple channels at once.
[15:52:50] <Wilfredor> hi guys, I have jqmigrate, and 3.31 jquery. How I could see the hints to remove old code Deprecated?
[15:53:03] <robertmaxrees> lol
[15:53:05] <Aljone> its not really since its realyl urgent and some times u cant reach everyone
[15:53:12] <robertmaxrees> Alexer it is rude, actually :)
[15:53:30] <Aljone> ok sorry
[15:53:51] <robertmaxrees> Wilfredor 1: don't shotgun questions out to multiple channels pls :) 2: just open your browser's dev tools and make sure you have a high enough logging level selected.
[15:55:13] <Wilfredor> Robdgreat there are some project scanner to see all hints that i need migrate?
[15:55:15] <robertmaxrees> Wilfredor you can set the logging level using this: https://i.imgur.com/FTCJJZT.png
[15:55:28] <robertmaxrees> Wilfredor not that I'm familiar with, no.
[15:55:33] <robertmaxrees> there might be, though.
[15:56:47] <Wilfredor> I can see only the jqmigrate startup message
[15:57:11] <robertmaxrees> and you've got the level set high enough?
[15:57:19] <robertmaxrees> logging level in your dev tools, i mean.
[15:59:01] <robertmaxrees> also: you'll have to actually navigate the site and preserve your logs in your dev tools.
[15:59:15] <robertmaxrees> migrate doesn't scan anything, just tells you when a deprecated method has been hit.
[16:00:33] <Alexer> robertmaxrees, what did I do this time?! ;)
[16:01:03] <robertmaxrees> :shrug: when you ask generic questions and don't give us details about what you've been doing/the issues you're having, you're leaving things up to interpretation.
[16:01:06] <robertmaxrees> can't read your mind, bud.
[16:01:28] <Alexer> robertmaxrees, note that Alexer != Aljone :-)
[16:01:44] <robertmaxrees> sorry - my bad :)
[16:02:03] <robertmaxrees> autocomplete strikes again
[16:02:11] <Alexer> yeah, no problem :)
[16:02:55] <Alexer> I guess some IRC clients complete the first nick in alphabetical order; I think irssi completes to the most recently active nick
[16:04:55] <Wilfredor> robertmaxrees yes
[16:05:14] <robertmaxrees> mine is alpha.  usually not an issue tho.
[16:05:31] <Wilfredor> robertmaxrees the site is too big, there are almost 300 pages not directly easy to enter
[16:05:44] <Wilfredor> thats why Im looking for a scaner
[16:05:54] <robertmaxrees> Wilfredor back up - do you mean 300 hardcoded pages?
[16:06:28] <robertmaxrees> like, 300 html files stored on a server?  or are you using some kind of server-side language with some kind of rendering, like node, php, or ASP?
[16:10:29] <Wilfredor> yes, its a server side language
[16:10:33] <Wilfredor> Java
[16:10:36] <Wilfredor> JSP
[16:10:46] <robertmaxrees> so you have 300 base page templates?
[16:11:45] <Wilfredor> I need comeback to home, see you tomorrow, thanks for your help
[16:11:57] * taplar blinks
[16:12:03] <robertmaxrees> lolwut
[16:12:05] <robertmaxrees> k
[16:22:47] <physikoi> Hey #jquery, I'm wondering if this* is a useless .off. * https://github.com/marekdedic/imagelightbox/blob/00114cff5a5def59a26570e21229a19d81fd23ee/src/imagelightbox.js#L760
[16:23:08] <robertmaxrees> why would it be useless?
[16:23:23] <physikoi> For one, it doesn't seem to do anything.
[16:23:33] <robertmaxrees> it does :)
[16:24:03] <robertmaxrees> looks like it's removing previously bound click handlers from this plugin.
[16:25:54] <robertmaxrees> yep - https://github.com/marekdedic/imagelightbox/blob/00114cff5a5def59a26570e21229a19d81fd23ee/src/imagelightbox.js#L112
[16:26:30] <robertmaxrees> so it's running $(document).off('click', 'a[data-imagelightbox]'); - which is valid per https://api.jquery.com/off/
[16:27:22] <physikoi> robertmaxrees: Ok, I'm thinking, the plugin still works after clicking, but now i'm seeing again that everything that has the listeners added with .on are destroyed. This is code I had been working on for a while, but then took off for a while (actually took off from coding altogether).
[16:27:42] <robertmaxrees> not sure I follow.
[16:27:48] <robertmaxrees> it looks like cleanup code.
[16:28:13] <physikoi> I'm thinking it would be more robust to remove the options.selector option and just hard code that off target as '[data-imagelightbox]' as that data attribute is required to start plugin
[16:28:23] <physikoi> robertmaxrees: you are right
[16:28:39] <robertmaxrees> i wouldn't do that personally.
[16:29:01] <physikoi> Is it possible to ".off()" by namespace?
[16:29:12] <taplar> yes
[16:29:23] <physikoi> robertmaxrees: why not? Curious
[16:29:34] <robertmaxrees> cleaner and more readable imho
[16:29:45] <physikoi> taplar: $(document).off('.nameSpace', selector) ?
[16:29:54] <robertmaxrees> https://api.jquery.com/off/
[16:30:00] <robertmaxrees> "One or more space-separated event types and optional namespaces, or just namespaces, such as "click", "keydown.myPlugin", or ".myPlugin"."
[16:30:27] <robertmaxrees> :)
[16:31:02] <physikoi> thank you robertmaxrees  and taplar . It can be really eye opening just talking for a minute with someone "outside" of a project
[16:33:06] <robertmaxrees> sure.  perspectice is a good thing.
[16:33:10] <robertmaxrees> sure.  perspective is a good thing.
[16:33:21] <robertmaxrees> woah that was weird.
[16:35:21] <taplar> worth repeating
[16:39:05] <physikoi> haha
