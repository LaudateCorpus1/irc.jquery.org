[07:26:08] <sine0> hello folks. I am on the time travelled quest of making <img> fit the whole parent div whilst maintaining aspect ratio. I have found a cool plugin called https://github.com/GestiXi/image-scale that works, but I want to also include some other things like lazy loading etc. when I tried including lazy load js it broke because some rely on the data-src instead of src etc. I want to know; is there an all in one
[07:26:14] <sine0> gallery style library taht deals with this
[07:26:52] <sine0> people point me to masonry but I want a fixed grid system more than masonry grid/tiels
[09:05:12] <sine0> Does the browser automatically fetch the src= of images ?
[09:05:20] <Cork> yes
[09:09:37] <sine0> I have lazy load and image-scale libs, both seperately work. lazy-load uses the data-src for the url and i assume it fetches it, but image-scale uses src. so i tried to update all the image-scale attr('src') to attr('data-src') but because the iamges are not fetched it cant work out the sizes. is it hard to fetch the image
[09:10:57] <Cork> well if you replace src with data-src it means the image isn't fetched so the intristic size (the raw data size) of the image is unknown
[09:11:09] <Cork> the browser can't know that until it fetches the image
[09:11:13] <sine0> yes and so it scales it but the scaling is wrong its stretched
[09:11:23] <Cork> ya, cause you don't have the sizes
[09:11:41] <Cork> you would have to hardcode the width and height of the img element
[09:11:42] <sine0> so, is there a way without double fetching it
[09:11:53] <Cork> so it can hold a static size nomatter if it has the image or not
[09:12:01] <sine0> I mean can I share the fetched object from the other script local global in php
[09:12:16] <sine0> like global*
[09:12:28] <Cork> your only option is to set the width and height values in the img tag
[09:12:32] <Cork> or prefetch the images
[09:13:33] <sine0> but prefetch means no lazyload
[09:13:48] <Cork> prefetch is the absolute oposite to lazyloading
[09:13:59] <Cork> you have prefetch => normal loading => lazyloading
[09:14:08] <sine0> and the whole point of this is to use images of different ar
[09:14:15] <Cork> prefetch means you fetch it as soon as the script can start requesting them
[09:14:30] <Cork> ya, so you don't have the images, so you can't ask the browser to scaly them
[09:14:48] <Cork> so the only option you have left is to have the backend give you the sizes of the images
[09:14:49] <sine0> yes i did that for script switching on a form, you told me months back
[09:18:07] <sine0> I guess.. lazyload gallery would work better on masonry.. and for scaled to parent container gallerys it should be done without lazy. such a shame im pretty sure it was in foogallery on wordpress plugin
[09:18:33] <sine0> oh they have github
[09:18:39] <Cork> sine0: normally for lazyload or masonry the image width or height are defined
[09:18:40] <sine0> 12 days ago commit: "updated lazy load logic and setting of data-src options not needed2
[09:18:45] <Cork> and in many cases both
[09:19:10] <Cork> you can't lazyload the image but still layout based on the intristic size of the images
[09:19:12] <Cork> it is not possible
[09:19:38] <Cork> you're asking the browser to scale a number it doesn't have, it just can't be done
[09:20:14] <sine0> okie
[09:20:23] <Cork> "scale x with y and give me result number, i need the answer now, but i will give you the vaules in a while"
[09:20:32] <sine0> hehe
[09:20:51] <sine0> maybe wordpress stores this info as it does store alot of info on images
[09:20:57] <Cork> doubt it
[09:20:58] <sine0> i know its does on the srcsets
[09:21:11] <Cork> but you can fairly easily grab the image size in php
[09:21:21] <Cork> imagemagic has lots of nice tools for that
[09:21:54] <Cork> i would prob recommend creating a table and storing it, or you will infur a lot of disk io if you get more then random visitors
[09:23:26] <sine0> foogallery plugin does what I need, im just trying to replicate it, maybe the way it scales is more harsh or it passed the image size information after it fetches it. I have to dash now will be back later. thanks for the chat
[09:33:23] <Kradsbo> Hello good people
[09:34:02] <Kradsbo> Did any of you know how to change the checked status of dinamically generated Checkboxes?
[09:34:20] <Cork> uh, set the checked value
[09:34:23] <Cork> ?
[09:34:53] <Kradsbo> From an external control generated outside of It?
[09:35:03] <Cork> outside of what?
[09:35:20] <Cork> i expect you talk about a <input type="checkbox">
[09:35:47] <Kradsbo> Let me try to show Code, i cant use nopaste but maybie i can send an image
[09:35:55] <Cork> no
[09:36:03] <Cork> create a jsfiddle showing the problem you have
[09:36:19] <Cork> if you can copy paste the source code, then create a demo
[09:46:37] <Kradsbo> I cant, it's job Code and somehow they thing block nopastes is a good practice
[09:47:23] <Kradsbo> But yeah Cork you kinda have the idea
[09:47:48] <Kradsbo> I have some Checkboxes generated inside a foreach
[09:48:20] <Kradsbo> And i want to change the status of all of them at the same time
[09:48:33] <Cork> well without anything (not image) to look at the only thing i can say is set the checked value of the dom element
[09:48:57] <Cork> chkelm.checked = false/true
[09:54:29] <Kradsbo> Thats fair Cork, i'm gonna try that, thanks
[10:38:34] <titaniumleg> How would I tie a yadcf filter to an ajax response for a datatable request? https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55633914/how-to-source-yadcf-select-filter-options-with-response-array
[10:39:22] <titaniumleg> Think it's more of a general JS/jQuery question than necessarily specific to DataTables and yadcf
[13:31:03] <Taplar> slow day
[13:31:08] <robertmaxrees> ay
[13:31:11] <robertmaxrees> *aye
