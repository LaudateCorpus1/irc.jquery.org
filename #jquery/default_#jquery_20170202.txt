[00:33:10] <kalaznikov> hello!
[00:33:11] <kalaznikov> @foreach (var link in Model.RaportiLingid) {     <a href="" data-navigeerimine="ajutine" data-menyy-url="@Url.Action(link.Action, link.Controller, new { raportiID = link.RaportiID })">@link.Nimi</a>     <br /> }
[00:33:19] <kalaznikov> how i can put it in jquery or ajax
[00:33:25] <kalaznikov> to get same input
[00:33:41] <kalaznikov> without data-navigation
[02:31:33] <aro> if i have two separate binds to a form submit, one on an id and one on a class - which will get invoked first?
[02:38:42] <kevireilly> aro: first come first serve or first bound first handle
[02:44:04] <Cork> aro: the selector used doesn't matter, the events are bound on dom elements not based on selectors
[03:37:30] <Yepp> what does toggleClass return? I'm trying to trace something in this project and it has `$parent.toggleClass(ch) && checked`
[03:37:41] <Yepp> tried to do console.log and alert but it only returns object
[03:37:54] <Yepp> how was it used in that context?
[03:39:19] <acidjazz>       $('.selection').on 'hover', '.inner > .values > .value', @hoverHandler
[03:39:21] <acidjazz> why wont that fire
[03:41:15] <hellyeah> fiddle?
[03:44:00] <EugenA> i'm creating a tag like this: atag = $('<a/>').attr("href", "#").text(result[i].title);
[03:44:05] <EugenA> to get the html for my new tag, i need to convert the object to string, right?
[03:44:17] <acidjazz> im an idiot, hover isnt an actual event
[03:45:45] <EugenA> trying atag.prop('outerHTML'), but I'm getting this: &lt;a href="#"&gt;Pilates Lehrer&lt;/a&gt;
[03:47:04] <slax0r> EugenA: you can append it to dom without converting to string
[03:47:15] <slax0r> just $(selector).append()
[03:47:21] <slax0r> .append(yourObj) sorry
[03:48:42] <EugenA> what if I want to append it to another element as a child?
[03:49:19] <EugenA> $('<div/>', { ... text: atag ...}) doesn't work
[03:49:43] <acidjazz> how about this, whats the sweet way these days to checkfor a click outside of a modal to close it
[03:50:17] <EugenA> I'm getting this: <div>[object Object]</div>
[03:50:30] <Yepp> acidjazz: :not ?
[03:50:33] <EugenA> slax0r: ^
[03:51:00] <acidjazz> Yepp: so like what.... i put a clikc handler on $(document) and how to i use that?
[03:53:54] <slax0r> EugenA: https://jsfiddle.net/hmhp44ph/
[03:55:01] <slax0r> https://jsfiddle.net/hmhp44ph/1/
[03:55:05] <slax0r> with appending to another elem
[03:55:07] <Yepp> acidjazz: nvm the :not. how about something like this? https://paste.ee/p/eXFor
[03:56:08] <EugenA> slax0r: nice, thanks!
[03:57:42] <Cork> Yepp: did you get the answer for the toggleClass question?
[03:57:48] <Yepp> nope
[03:58:03] <Cork> toggleClass returns the jquery object so you can chain functions
[03:58:24] <Cork> so $().html().toggleClass() and $().toggleClass().html() both work and do the same thing
[03:58:44] <Yepp> yea but how is it used in that context? why would $parent.toggleClass(ch) && checked returns true or false?
[03:59:02] <EugenA> slax0r: I'm generating like this elements in a for-loop. I'm apping them to parent-div $('.searchbox__content .col-grid').append(newDiv); but getting only one element in my result html
[03:59:15] <acidjazz> Yepp: i ended up doing a $(document) click then a stopproogation on the div im working on
[03:59:16] <Yepp> tried removing $parent.toggleClass() as I thought it'll always be true because it always has a value
[03:59:17] <EugenA> append overwrites all?
[03:59:20] <Cork> Yepp: if($parent.toggleClass(ch) && checked) {} would be identical to $parent.toggleClass(ch); if(checked) {}
[03:59:28] <Yepp> but it broke something
[03:59:37] <Yepp> ohh
[04:00:09] <Cork> as toggleClass is always truethy
[04:00:22] <Cork> (as objects are truethy)
[04:00:50] <Yepp> yea that's what i said. forgot that it'll be executed in that context
[04:00:57] <Yepp> i was only finding the return value
[04:01:02] <Yepp> thanks Cork
[04:01:07] <Cork> np
[04:02:02] <slax0r> EugenA: EugenA nope, shouldn't https://jsfiddle.net/hmhp44ph/2/
[04:02:11] <slax0r> can you make a fiddle of how you're doing it?
[04:02:41] <slax0r> are you sure your loop runs as many times as you expect it?
[04:03:46] <Cork> EugenA: you can't append html or dom elements with text: you must use html:
[04:04:00] <Cork> text: is explicitly there to prevent adding of none text content to the dom
[04:08:12] <EugenA> slax0r: oh.. i had .empty() in my loop
[04:08:47] <Cork> ah
[04:09:03] <Cork> EugenA: btw you want to create the element in the loop and append them in one go when you're done
[04:09:23] <Cork> or you will make the append take order of magnitude more work for the browser to do
[04:09:40] <Cork> (each separate append causes a reflow in the page and that is VERY expensive)
[04:10:00] <slax0r> EugenA: that would explain a lot
[04:10:13] <acidjazz> is there any sweet dominate lib for pushing/popping the query string
[04:10:41] <Cork> acidjazz: why would you need to push pop the query string?
[04:11:10] <acidjazz> really?
[04:12:14] <Cork> acidjazz: there might be solutions, but i would need to know what you need it for
[04:12:19] <acidjazz> say im in a situation where the code doesnt want to reset the query string
[04:12:19] <Cork> cause ya, i don't really see the point
[04:12:30] <acidjazz> i just want to add/remove a single parameter
[04:12:30] <Cork> reset query string...
[04:12:38] <Cork> AH you mean url parameters
[04:12:41] <acidjazz> yea
[04:12:48] <acidjazz> sorry i guess thats a back end phrase for it
[04:12:53] <acidjazz> url params lemme google that
[04:12:53] <Cork> was too deep into jquery there :P
[04:13:32] <Cork> acidjazz: the term you used was correct, it just has multiple meaning when asked in #jquery or ##css :)
[04:14:17] <Cork> there is a lib for that
[04:14:30] <acidjazz> what do you recommend
[04:14:45] <acidjazz> ive written this wheel so many times and im sick of it
[04:14:50] <Cork> i haven't used it my self but i've looked at a few
[04:15:04] <Cork> https://github.com/allmarkedup/purl is one
[04:15:20] <Cork> but there is another one...
[04:15:41] <acidjazz> jqueyr version nice
[04:15:59] <Cork> https://github.com/AceMetrix/jquery-deparam
[04:16:10] <Cork> and http://vistaprint.github.io/SkinnyJS/jquery.queryString.html
[04:16:17] <Cork> can't give you any recommendations though
[04:16:26] <acidjazz> oof i like Purl but its 2 years old now
[04:16:37] <Cork> and is marked as unmaintained
[04:17:40] <acidjazz> one w/ pushState support wouel be nice
[04:17:41] <acidjazz> would*
[04:18:19] <acidjazz> https://github.com/browserstate/history.js/
[04:19:35] <acidjazz> 2 year gap in that one
[04:19:36] <acidjazz> man
[04:24:58] <acidjazz> i think https://github.com/sindresorhus/query-string wins
[04:31:10] <acidjazz> Cork: https://github.com/ljharb/qs a+
[04:31:14] <acidjazz> new winner
[05:27:50] <Macaveli> Hi all! I have a dropdown with a combination of Zipcode & Location. But when another country is selected it should become a textbox. But when US is selected again it should be back a dropdown. Any suggestions if this is achievable?
[05:31:08] <Yepp> Macaveli change the 'type' or hide/show two input
[05:31:11] <Cork> Macaveli: have two elements and hide the one you don't want (don't forget to set it to disabled)
[05:31:29] <Cork> if you don't then both will be submitted
[05:31:56] <Yepp> Macaveli: no nvm the type.
[08:41:27] <km4> hi

[08:42:30] <km4> yeap
[08:42:40] <km4> I use indexOf and substr
[08:43:00] <Cork> ... then why are you asking?
[08:43:25] <km4> dont have good results
[08:43:39] <km4> moent try to do some code
[08:52:27] <km4> oh maybe I should use regex

[10:39:12] <qakhan> hi all, i am adding rows from table to "New-Grop" by select the "New-Grop" and then click on table rows.
[10:41:06] <qakhan> rows are moving from table to "New-Grop". but there is duplication in "New-Grop" if user click same row 2 or more time.
[10:41:36] <qakhan> i am trying to check if row already exits then dont add in "New-Grop".
[10:42:40] <qakhan> but it seems its not working. here is my code https://fiddle.jshell.net/6faumn44/81/
[10:43:27] <qakhan> it seems if() statement is not working in .each() loop
[10:48:38] <rgman> I would suggest a better way for identifying the selected rows.
[10:49:01] <qakhan> yes please
[10:51:30] <rgman> I see you get the cab number from the first cell in the row. Try using the data-* attributes in the HTML and then from jQuery.
[10:52:01] <rgman> You could set data-cab-number="1123" in the <tr> element.
[10:54:33] <rgman> Or you could simply include that number in the new row id. Then you can if that id exists. If it doesn't you add it to the new table, else you don't.
[10:56:33] <qakhan> rgman i am sorry i could not get you. include that number in the new row id......
[11:00:27] <rgman> Yeah. In the line where you append the new row HTML, add an id attribute, say id='new-row-<cabnumber>'.
[11:01:25] <rgman> So, you can check if that id exists before appending it.
[11:01:40] <rgman> In that way, you can avoid duplicates.
[11:03:23] <qakhan> rgman my row numbers are unique, so why it will not work
[11:15:41] <sillyslux> you end up with multiple elements with id cabnum, don't do that
[11:16:40] <qakhan> sillyslux you are poing to <i id='cabnum' class='fa fa-taxi'></i>
[11:16:51] <qakhan> its just an logo
[11:16:53] <sillyslux> #sidenote
[11:17:01] <sillyslux> then make it a class
[11:17:34] <qakhan> ok but in my current example logo is not there
[11:55:36] <Kzya> hi im new to the coding world and i was wondering if i can make a timer using settimeout but with notifying when theres a few seconds left
[11:56:28] <Kzya> i'd really appreciate any example sources for it!
[13:18:54] <syntax> does someone know a plugin which can save the firebug changes in a cloud or other way?
[13:19:13] <duch_kazatel> you mean the changes you make in the dev tools?
[13:19:24] <syntax> ye firebug dev tool
[13:19:33] <duch_kazatel> fwiw firebug is on its way out.
[13:19:51] <duch_kazatel> i know you can set something like that up for css.
[13:21:13] <sillyslux> syntax, with chrome you can use workspaces
[13:21:28] <syntax> what is it?
[13:21:53] <sillyslux> (live) editing js and sass/css
[13:21:55] <syntax> duch_kazatel: link for fwiw? google aint commit me good results
[13:22:06] <syntax> sillyslux: link?
[13:22:12] <duch_kazatel> that's short for "for what uit's worth".
[13:22:21] <duch_kazatel> i was pointing out that firebug is dying.
[13:22:32] <syntax> oh rly?
[13:22:34] <duch_kazatel> yeah.
[13:22:41] <syntax> and what r ppl using now?
[13:22:42] <sillyslux> in developertools sources panel right click in tree view or go to devtools-settings/workspaces
[13:22:49] <duch_kazatel> the basic dev tools in firefox.
[13:22:50] <duch_kazatel> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Style_Editor#Editing_original_sources
[13:22:59] <duch_kazatel> ^ CSS editing is baked-in to the browser.
[13:23:07] <duch_kazatel> anything beyond that and I'd look at chrome.
[13:23:17] <syntax> k
[13:24:24] <sillyslux> https://developers.google.com/web/tools/setup/setup-workflow
[13:25:40] <syntax> so those dev tools are editing my sass/less files on the fly?
[13:25:43] <syntax> am i right?
[13:28:11] <sillyslux> you are editing, devtools saves your files when you hit ctrl-s
[13:28:39] <duch_kazatel> you could also look at a livereload type of solution instead.
[13:28:43] <sillyslux> gulp/grunt/webpack w/e recompiles your sass/less on file changes
[13:28:56] <duch_kazatel> ^
[13:28:59] <sillyslux> webpack has livereload on it's own
[13:29:09] <robertmaxrees> git status
[13:29:14] <sillyslux> sass -w or so does recompiling too
[13:29:54] <sillyslux> you then directly edit sass/less in styles panel
[13:30:23] <sillyslux> also js is reloaded live when you edit js files, so you don't have to reload
[13:30:57] <sillyslux> but that's not good enough for code in $(document).ready(/...not good enough here/)
[13:44:58] <SpecialTek> https://jsfiddle.net/te28q6cf/ - So I'm having issues with .split() being a "function" and I'm assuming this is cause of the clone()
[13:48:00] <SpecialTek> Anybody know a way to achieve this?
[13:53:15] <sillyslux> what are you trying to achieve?
[13:54:09] <SpecialTek> I want to duplicate the wishlist URL and convert to "add to cart" url
[13:55:02] <sillyslux> you want the clone to have text "add to cart"?
[13:57:32] <SpecialTek> So this one works http://jsfiddle.net/FZ5bJ/
[13:57:51] <SpecialTek> pretty much the end result, but I converted it to multiple buttons/urls now
[13:57:56] <sillyslux> oh wait... you're doing split('/'), that supposed to happen on the url?
[13:58:10] <SpecialTek> Yea, I'm assuming I'm having issues because of the clone()
[14:02:29] <sillyslux> you mean like this? https://jsfiddle.net/te28q6cf/1/
[14:04:10] <sillyslux> newLink already is an jquery element there, no need for $(newLink), https://jsfiddle.net/te28q6cf/2/
[14:06:41] <SpecialTek> sillyslux - yes!
[14:06:43] <SpecialTek> Thanks!
[14:07:09] <SpecialTek> hmm, so yea, I forgot to select the attr()
[14:07:20] <SpecialTek> so it makes sense why it wasn't working
[14:07:59] <sillyslux> yes
[14:08:03] <sillyslux> :)

[14:13:12] <leaJr> How to tranlate to jquery?
[14:13:29] <robertmaxrees> technically already is.
[14:13:33] <leaJr> That is from prototype.js
[14:13:39] <leaJr> Thx
[14:13:45] <robertmaxrees> koh hah
[14:13:47] <robertmaxrees> *oh
[14:13:52] <robertmaxrees> pretty easy.
[14:13:58] <robertmaxrees> setAttribute == attr
[14:14:04] <robertmaxrees> insert probably == append.
[14:14:18] <robertmaxrees> up is probably == closest
[14:14:55] <robertmaxrees> getAttribute also == attr.  should be relatively easy to translate.
[14:15:43] <leaJr> robertmaxrees thanks , but can you help me to translate that full code?
[14:15:51] <robertmaxrees> we can help you figure it out :)
[14:16:32] <leaJr> I need that script from prototype in my web, but conflict with my jquery
[14:16:43] <robertmaxrees> we can help you translate it.
[14:17:07] <leaJr> This is the full code   "javascript:$$('input[type=\"file\"]').each(function(f){var f1 = f; f.type='button'; f.value='"+chooseFileStr+"'; f.on('click', function() {KitKatUploads.upload(f1.getAttribute('id'), f1.getAttribute('name'));}); f = f.up('form'); f.insert('<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"shouldInterceptRequest\" value=\"1\">' ); f.setAttribute('method','get'); });"
[14:17:13] <robertmaxrees> hey so use jsfiddle.
[14:17:22] <robertmaxrees> and we won't do it for you.
[14:17:26] <robertmaxrees> we'llhelp you figure it out.
[14:18:22] <leaJr> I will run that code from my android webview app
[14:18:39] <leaJr> loadUrl("code");
[14:19:11] <robertmaxrees> that's fine.
[14:19:15] <robertmaxrees> we'll help you translate it.
[14:19:27] <leaJr> Thanks
[14:19:35] <qakhan> can someone please help me out. if() statement is not working under .each()
[14:19:46] <robertmaxrees> qakhan just ask yer question.
[14:19:48] <qakhan> here is my code https://fiddle.jshell.net/6faumn44/91/
[14:19:48] <robertmaxrees> :)
[14:20:43] <robertmaxrees> qakhan have you checked that groupscabs_num is what you think it is?
[14:21:24] <qakhan> its "New-Grop" all rows
[14:21:37] <robertmaxrees> qakhan so what about iut doesn't work?
[14:21:38] <qakhan> TD(0).text()
[14:22:59] <leaJr> robertmaxrees this project i will implement https://bitbucket.org/uchile-adi/kitkatwebviewuploads
[14:23:17] <robertmaxrees> leaJr not sure what you're expecting here.
[14:23:31] <robertmaxrees> leaJr start trying to pick it apart and we'll help guide you along.
[14:23:43] <qakhan> ok if i select "New-Grop" and click on row of 1st table. then i want to compare if that same row already exists in "New-Grop"
[14:24:12] <qakhan> if yes then dont do anything. else add row from 1st table to "New-Grop"
[14:24:15] <robertmaxrees> qakhan have you tried console logging things to make sure you're selecting what you're looking for?
[14:24:31] <qakhan> yes
[14:24:41] <robertmaxrees> so then where does the issue lie?
[14:25:00] <qakhan> https://fiddle.jshell.net/6faumn44/91/     here you can see
[14:25:06] <robertmaxrees> ...
[14:25:10] <qakhan> in if() statement
[14:25:14] <robertmaxrees> i'm trying to help you learn to debug here :)
[14:25:59] <sillyslux> also use the "tidy" button in jsfiddle
[14:26:14] <qakhan> cabstable_cab_num is holding 1st table clicked row td(0).text()
[14:26:47] <qakhan> groupscabs_num is holding all rows td(0).text()
[14:27:31] <robertmaxrees> that handler isn't even firing.
[14:27:51] <qakhan> when cabstable_cab_num compares with all groupscabs_num rows it does not work
[14:28:08] <robertmaxrees> if ($('div .selectgroupname').hasClass('groupselected')) {
[14:28:14] <robertmaxrees> you sure you want that to be a global lookup?
[14:28:51] <qakhan> yes because there will be more groups like "New-Grop"
[14:29:03] <leaJr> robertmaxrees, my project is android webview based to run my website (that using jquery), i need to replace my input type file with button by load that script from webview loadUrl
[14:29:13] <robertmaxrees> do you want to know if ANY of them have that class?  or the first one qakhan
[14:29:20] <robertmaxrees> leaJr that's fne - are you expecting us to do it for you?
[14:29:39] <robertmaxrees> because we won't - we'll help guide you and answer questions for you :)_
[14:30:04] <qakhan> robertmaxrees yes

[14:31:11] <robertmaxrees> ask questions :)
[14:31:27] <qakhan> i asked you question :)
[14:31:34] <robertmaxrees> not you - leaJr :)
[14:31:43] <qakhan> ok

[14:34:41] <robertmaxrees> so did you check your console for errors?
[14:35:19] <robertmaxrees> because there's a simple first error.
[14:35:32] <robertmaxrees> https://api.jquery.com/each/ - first arg that gets passed to the callback for each is the index, not the element.
[14:36:06] <qakhan> robertmaxrees ($('div .selectgroupname').hasClass('groupselected')) is passing.  click on "New-Grop" and the click on 1st table rows
[14:37:22] <qakhan> the problem with if() which i under .each()
[14:37:31] <qakhan> if(cabstable_cab_num == groupscabs_num)
[14:37:36] <robertmaxrees> cabstable_cab_num and groupscabs_num don't match.
[14:37:48] <robertmaxrees> so the issue isn't the if itself.
[14:37:59] <robertmaxrees> probably with groupscabs_num = $(this).children('td:eq(0)').text().trim(); and  var cabstable_cab_num = $(this).children('td:eq(0)').text().trim();
[14:39:08] <qakhan> as you can see 1st 3 rows of both tables are equal
[14:39:21] <robertmaxrees> then you're hitting your else block fine in some cases...
[14:39:23] <qakhan> so if(cabstable_cab_num == groupscabs_num) should be true. right?
[14:39:42] <robertmaxrees> it'll be false until it finds a match.
[14:39:52] <leaJr> robertmaxrees, still not work
[14:40:00] <robertmaxrees> leaJr that's fine.  show me the updated version.
[14:40:03] <robertmaxrees> update the fiddle.
[14:40:10] <robertmaxrees> keep stepping on through :)
[14:42:20] <leaJr> robertmaxrees, sorry my code is must be in one line, this is string
[14:42:28] <robertmaxrees> leaJr we can do that later.
[14:42:28] <leaJr> Jsfiddle updated
[14:42:33] <robertmaxrees> send the new link.
[14:42:41] <leaJr> Old link
[14:42:44] <qakhan> robertmaxrees if you select "New-Group" and click on 1st row of 1st table you will see "NO"  and 1013 in console
[14:42:44] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[14:42:48] <robertmaxrees> it updates the link leaJr
[14:43:14] <leaJr> https://jsfiddle.net/xug1xym7/1/
[14:43:28] <qakhan> "NO" is coming from if(cabstable_cab_num == groupscabs_num)
[14:43:36] <robertmaxrees> leaJr that's the same gode.
[14:43:37] <robertmaxrees> no change.
[14:43:58] <robertmaxrees> qakhan bnecause the first one doesn't match.
[14:44:05] <qakhan> and 1013 comig from else{console.log(cabstable_cab_num);
[14:44:39] <robertmaxrees> qakhan it's an each...
[14:44:43] <apatik> hello, does anyone know how the slide effect here ( https://jqueryui.com/effect/ ) is done so it doesn't display a scrollbar while the div is out of the container during the animation ?
[14:44:45] <robertmaxrees> what are you expecting to have happen instead?
[14:44:59] <leaJr> My input type file still not replace with new button type, i have no idea robertmaxrees
[14:45:17] <robertmaxrees> leaJr did oyu read the docs i sent and my comment about .each()?
[14:45:27] <qakhan> robertmaxrees if same row found then stop the .each()
[14:45:27] <robertmaxrees> $('input[type="file"]').each(function(f) { - f is the index in this case, not the element.
[14:45:35] <robertmaxrees> qakhan that's what it's doing.
[14:45:44] <qakhan> no
[14:45:49] <robertmaxrees> yes.
[14:45:49] <qakhan> its not
[14:45:55] <robertmaxrees> you see no and then a match.
[14:46:14] <qakhan> but you also see 1013
[14:46:20] <qakhan> which is in the else
[14:46:26] <robertmaxrees> because on the second interation, it finds a match.
[14:47:12] <qakhan> i dont want to do secnd iteration if it found in 1st
[14:47:31] <robertmaxrees> it didn't find it on the first.
[14:48:04] <qakhan> let me change the text, current one is confusing
[14:48:16] <robertmaxrees> try to boil the test down if you can, too.
[14:48:56] <robertmaxrees> leaJr did any of what I said make sense?
[14:49:33] <leaJr> robertmaxrees, yes..
[14:49:39] <robertmaxrees> so did you fix it?
[14:49:52] <leaJr> Not yet :(
[14:50:02] <robertmaxrees> getting any console errors with it?
[14:50:12] <leaJr> My goal is to replace my input with new button
[14:50:32] <leaJr> And call function on button click
[14:50:50] <robertmaxrees> lol
[14:51:09] <leaJr> Input type file is not work on android kitkat
[14:51:17] <qakhan> robertmaxrees please check this one and you will see the problem
[14:51:19] <qakhan> https://fiddle.jshell.net/6faumn44/94/
[14:51:33] <leaJr> So i cant upload file from my webview app
[14:52:09] <robertmaxrees> https://fiddle.jshell.net/6faumn44/95/
[14:52:21] <robertmaxrees> qakhan you're not returning out of that first block.
[14:52:22] <robertmaxrees> easy fix.
[14:52:35] <leaJr> This method can fix that issues, but using prototype, and my web is jquery
[14:52:37] <robertmaxrees> though you could've done a .filter() for this instead but w/e
[14:52:51] <robertmaxrees> leaJr you keep explaining your end result and not working on the code.
[14:52:56] <robertmaxrees> how can we help you?
[14:53:07] <robertmaxrees> are you expecting somebody to do the work for you?
[14:53:22] <robertmaxrees> brb
[14:53:34] <leaJr> I thi just translate my code (prototype) to jquery version..
[14:54:03] <qakhan> robertmaxrees its working for 1st row only, check with 2nd and 3rd row
[14:54:09] <qakhan> its not working.
[14:54:29] <leaJr> Conflict code, when i use both jquery and prototype
[14:58:43] <leaJr> Just want to change prototype to jquery in this project https://bitbucket.org/uchile-adi/kitkatwebviewuploads
[14:59:33] <leaJr> Owner statement : All this manipulation can be easily done with a front-end library like Prototype or JQuery. Our example uses Prototype.
[15:00:29] <robertmaxrees> back.
[15:00:40] <robertmaxrees> leaJr we can help you do that translation.
[15:01:33] <robertmaxrees> qakhan https://fiddle.jshell.net/6faumn44/96/
[15:01:43] <robertmaxrees> you were returning out of the wrong part.
[15:03:06] <qakhan> robertmaxrees its returing Match did not find of 1123 and Match Found, No need to run again.
[15:03:15] <robertmaxrees> right...
[15:03:20] <robertmaxrees> because it doesn't find it and then it does.
[15:03:35] <robertmaxrees> what are you expecting?  you're logging for each element in that each.
[15:03:51] <leaJr> robertmaxrees, if you have time, please look at this https://bitbucket.org/uchile-adi/kitkatwebviewuploads i have no idea to implement in jquery
[15:04:00] <robertmaxrees> leaJr what can we do to help?
[15:04:10] <robertmaxrees> not sure what your expectations are at the moment.
[15:04:50] <leaJr> Just translate prototype code to jquery
[15:05:18] <robertmaxrees> we can help step you through that.
[15:09:12] <MikeD_> can you assign pseudoclass via .css()?
[15:10:07] <qakhan> robertmaxrees here is acutall task i need to achive
[15:10:09] <qakhan> https://fiddle.jshell.net/6faumn44/98/
[15:10:46] <robertmaxrees> MikeD_ not last i checked.
[15:11:19] <robertmaxrees> qakhan so what's the issue?
[15:11:31] <qakhan> if row is already exists in "New-Grop" then dont add same row from 1st table to "New-Grop"
[15:12:52] <qakhan> you can see existing rows are being added multiple times
[15:13:08] <qakhan> only 1 rows is not being added
[15:14:03] <robertmaxrees> so really you want a list of allt he ones that don't exist and then append them to that group?
[15:14:22] <qakhan> yes
[15:18:04] <robertmaxrees> qakhan so why not use .filter() here instead?
[15:18:51] <qakhan> robertmaxrees can you please give me example of it
[15:19:36] <robertmaxrees> at its most basic, https://fiddle.jshell.net/6faumn44/99/
[15:20:05] <robertmaxrees> though i'd ditch window.clickedgrouptableid = $(this).siblings().children().prop('id'); and look for the element with that class instead.
[15:27:45] <qakhan> robertmaxrees its returning whole row with html. i need only td(0)
[15:28:11] <robertmaxrees> the .filter() just gets you elements that match.  you can use .each() from there to act on that set as necessarily.
[15:28:14] <robertmaxrees> *necessary
[15:28:19] <robertmaxrees> it makes your life a lot easier :)
[15:28:22] <robertmaxrees> brb
[15:31:06] <qakhan> robertmaxrees thanks
[15:54:47] <Es0teric> if i wanted to remove cookies from to domains that i own how would do that?
[15:55:00] <robertLunch> is the user on that domain currently?
[15:55:01] <Es0teric> i am talking about subdomains in two base domains
[15:55:05] <Es0teric> robertLunch yes
[15:55:30] <robertmaxrees> you'd delete them like any other cookie.
[15:55:41] <Es0teric> but lets say im in example1.com right?
[15:55:55] <Es0teric> but i want to delete cookies from sub1.example2.com, how would i do that
[15:56:45] <robertmaxrees> http://stackoverflow.com/a/117353/923919
[16:00:18] <robertmaxrees> that answer your question?
[16:29:26] <jajaja> i have input radio fields inside <p class="box"> what i'd like to happen when a user click's on radio button is that all the other input field inside other <p>s would be disabled?
[16:31:20] <jajaja> this doesn't work but something like that $( ".box input" ).not(this).prop('disabled',true);
[16:32:09] <jajaja> anybody here?
[16:39:23] <bbear> hello
[16:39:28] <bbear> what's a listener ?
[16:39:36] <bbear> what is jQuery good for ?
[16:44:59] <bbear> if you don't put your code in $(function(){}) where ?
[17:00:32] <taplar> bbear: a listener is a method that is attached to an element which will be invoked when the event it is associated with happens
[17:22:59] <akkufomk> bbear: I'm a good listener too
[19:58:22] <_August_> quick stupid question... Im using resize because im trying to resize the height dynamic from the resize of the window and i have a div name box with the height at 300px. using resize how would i adjust the height to increase and decrease the height? I I can increase it but for the life of me i cant remmeber how to do it both ways. https://jsfiddle.net/9z48vca5/
[19:59:03] <robertmaxrees> 2 questions: 1 - any reason you're not using CSS?
[19:59:28] <_August_> parallax bullshit problems
[19:59:56] <robertmaxrees> 2 - any reason you're not sizing against the size of the window instead of just incrementing/decrementing?
[20:00:10] <_August_> i tried with css and with the way that the navigation is and the content having to go over it, its just more problems than what its worth
[20:00:11] <robertmaxrees> also might consider throttling on that.
[20:02:17] <_August_> yeah i thought about it and even tried it and it didnt work as I was expecting it to
[20:02:26] <robertmaxrees> could you show what you tried?
[20:02:28] <_August_> the way i want to do it will solve my problems
[20:02:41] <_August_> deleted it
[20:02:59] <robertmaxrees> sizing the way you are is completely unreliable fwiw.  different browsers may fire at different rates, etc.
[20:03:13] <_August_> i know
[20:03:22] <robertmaxrees> heh.
[20:03:34] <_August_> i have something else in mind for it but i need this work first
[20:03:45] <robertmaxrees> then you'll have to see if the window size is larger or smaller than it was previously.
[20:04:13] <robertmaxrees> so you'll have to get the window height, compare it to the previous value, then store that state.
[20:05:06] <_August_> yup im aware
[20:05:18] <robertmaxrees> cool.
[20:46:44] <acidjazz> say i bind a click handler to .hi and i have  <div class="hi"></div class="howya"></div><div class="doing"></div></div> how can i test to see if i clicked on howya or clicke don doing
[23:11:48] <jcs802> hello
[23:12:03] <jcs802> if i have line 1 			$( ".masthead" ).slideUp( 200 ).delay( 500 ).fadeOut( 300 );
[23:12:10] <jcs802> and line 2			$('#showbar').show();
[23:12:22] <jcs802> how do i make it so line 2 doesnt fire until line 1 is done
[23:15:36] <jcs802> anyone?
[23:16:45] <CaffeinatedSky> Hi, I've googled everywhere and I can't seem to find how to call a function on "change" of a slider.  Example: https://jsfiddle.net/3easntee/
[23:17:17] <jcs802> oh its .promise() got it
[23:17:29] <CaffeinatedSky> I'm guessing it has to do with scope?
