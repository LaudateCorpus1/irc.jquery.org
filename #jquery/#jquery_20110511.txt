[14:25:53] <zjk> i fadeIn a div with a png background repeated x/y and i have strange display someone had this trouble ?
[14:26:13] <zjk> the footer of this div is also a png but not repeated and this one display well
[14:26:37] <Fighterlegend> zjk: What do you mean "strange display"?
[14:27:07] <zjk> because part of the bg repeated display well, and other parts none (looks like opacity is not exactly the same)
[14:27:19] <misterm> Deeply, it's not exactly like translating English to Spanish or something....jQuery is a javascript library, to "convert" javascript code to jQuery you just start using the jQuery functionality
[14:27:35] <Deeply> misterm: what if you know neither?
[14:28:16] <zjk> it appears in IE oc
[14:28:18] <misterm> Deeply: I'd learn them
[14:28:43] <Deeply> well, i'd like to find books on jquery but they don't make audio ones yet
[14:29:18] <b1nd3r> Hi. I'm trying to make the each loop in lines 3 to 11 to work, but even with the return false the ajax method on line 50 is being executed. I imagine this is occourring because return false; must be returning inside the each loop and not for the main function (sendForm), does anyone have an ideia on how to solve this? Thanks http://pastebin.com/3ScvYGm6
[14:29:27] <misterm> Deeply: sure, jquery is just a library though, you can learn the important parts from the API
[14:30:10] <Fighterlegend> b1nd3r: I'll take a look at it
[14:30:12] <Deeply> misterm: when my eye is tired, I tend to let the computer talk to me.
[14:30:17] <b1nd3r> Fighterlegend, thank you.
[14:30:23] <Fighterlegend> No problem
[14:31:01] <misterm> Deeply: sure, I've never used a screen-reader so I'm not sure how friendly the jQuery site is to them, but theres tons of jQuery sites and one should be fairly accessible
[14:31:23] <Deeply> well, I'm learning slowly...
[14:31:51] <misterm> Deeply: sure, so you can convert your code as you go along
[14:32:00] <Deeply> I'm trying to go through this page line by line to see what can be converted. but since I don't know the language and have no reference book like vb to vb.net, it's a bit difficult.
[14:32:19] <Deeply> but, I think i learned at least one thing today :)
[14:32:22] <misterm> Deeply: well that's what I'm saying, I don't think that's neccesarily the way to go
[14:32:38] <Deeply> well, 2 things
[14:32:56] <Deeply> var newtext; is the same in both javascript and jquery
[14:33:10] <Deeply> and
[14:33:13] <misterm> jQuery *is* javascript, it's a javascript library
[14:33:21] <misterm> so the only differences are going to be functions
[14:33:26] <phlp> b1nd3r: the return false is only stopping the each loop and not the sendForm. maybe you should just use a for loop if you want to return from there
[14:33:32] <Deeply> newtxt = document.getElementById('barcode').value; becomes $('barcode').val()
[14:33:42] <Deeply> i think
[14:33:51] <misterm> for example, instead of document.getElementByID you use the jQuery selectrot $("#id")
[14:33:51] <abjorn> misterm: I've seen almost this exact same thing said like 10 times this past week. More than usual, wonder what's up with that?
[14:33:58] <systemfault> Deeply: $('#barcode')...
[14:34:03] <Deeply> ok
[14:34:05] <Deeply> one sec
[14:34:14] <systemfault> Deeply: jQuery uses CSS selectors.
[14:34:25] <systemfault> and some stupid ugly extensions.
[14:34:34] <misterm> Deeply: so what I would do is actually learn the jQuery api, and then as you go along take that newfound knowledge and rewrite your old code
[14:34:34] <b1nd3r> phlp, well, if is acting syncronous so I may try some control variable and an if test?
[14:34:56] <systemfault> misterm: I'd probably learn JS before if I were him..
[14:35:11] <misterm> systemfault: sure, of course
[14:35:11] <Deeply>     newtxt = $('#barcode');
[14:35:15] <Deeply> i agree
[14:35:20] <phlp> b1nd3r: could do that.. var exit = false; before the each, then set it to true inside then check if its true and exit after the each
[14:35:37] <b1nd3r> yeah
[14:35:39] <b1nd3r> exactly
[14:36:38] <b1nd3r> something like this http://pastebin.com/yetV47Xq
[14:36:54] <davidw> jQuery has nothing for fetching the selected text on the screen in an x-platform way, does it:-/
[14:37:55] <tekhneek> .onchange?
[14:38:02] <Deeply> ok
[14:38:10] <Deeply> now let me guess on this next one
[14:38:24] <freshmilk> i'd like to update a value on an object, but be able to choose which object from a select list. is this easy to do?
[14:38:35] <freshmilk> oops. wrong channel! sorrry.
[14:38:42] <b1nd3r> phlp, worked, very clean solution. Liked it. =)
[14:38:44] <initself> Is it possible to use datepicker so that the date value actually changes when you select a new month/year without selecting a new day?
[14:38:48] <initself> http://jsfiddle.net/2tvBy/4/
[14:38:57] <phlp> b1nd3r: nice work :)
[14:39:07] <Deeply> document.getElementById('submitbutton').click(); would become $('#submitbutton').click(); ?
[14:40:02] <Deeply> but the if statement above would stay the same
[14:40:43] <Know1edge> How can I make a draggable also a droppable ?
[14:41:16] <orolo> $("#chaining").draggable().droppable()?
[14:41:50] <Know1edge> the element keeps going below the droppable
[14:42:00] <Know1edge> looks like a z-index issue
[14:51:03] <Deeply> http://jsbin.com/ojeme5/edit
[14:51:24] <orolo> LSshock_: i think you need to loop through the <li>'s that have that classname; wait; is the format already in the HTML that you need to reproduce somewhere else?
[14:51:32] <LSshock_> im really not that best in coding this seems awfully hard, what exactly should i store into localStorage?
[14:51:42] <outoftime> I've read up on the changes in JQ 1.6 with the attr() and prop() methods, but I'm wondering what the semantics of the attr(name, value) call are. Since attributes don't represent the dynamic state of the DOM, how is such a call still possible?
[14:51:49] <LSshock_> orolo: html to html i suppose
[14:51:49] <systemfault> dmnc: Depends. What do you want to do?
[14:52:10] <LSshock_> orolo: it gets made as user is on the site, then later in case of emergency is restored
[14:52:18] <orolo> LSshock_: oh.
[14:52:21] <dmnc> systemfault: at the moment, I wanna choose all checkboxes having id beginning with 'foo_' string
[14:52:36] <LSshock_> orolo: but basically its <UL> with <LI> inside
[14:53:11] <systemfault> dmnc: You written how a few lines upward
[14:53:19] <misterm> LSshock_: for localStorage I'd use a library that wraps it, most of them will handle serialization for you
[14:53:20] <dmnc> dmnc: generally, I need to specify the selector above multiple attributes of the element
[14:53:30] <simple__> how do i do something to hit a variable div like $('#content-'  + idnum).style ??
[14:53:45] <orolo> LSshock_: what's an emergency? like their browser caches? then yeah, localStorage.
[14:53:55] <misterm> LSshock_: so you would just have the data in whatever format you want, say an array, and then do storage.save( array_of_data )
[14:53:56] <LSshock_> orolo: yes
[14:54:02] <dmnc> systemfault: tnx
[14:54:12] <Deeply> misterm, I added you to the thank you list :)
[14:54:29] <systemfault> dmnc: [id^="foo_"] ?
[14:54:34] <LSshock_> misterm: would a jquery plugin do alright?
[14:54:47] <LSshock_> misterm: im using sortable from jquery UI that can save to an array
[14:54:48] <misterm> Deeply: thanks
[14:54:58] <Deeply> misterm: http://jsbin.com/ojeme5/edit
[14:55:03] <Deeply> that's it
[14:55:10] <Deeply> i think i got everything
[14:55:24] <dmnc> systemfault: input[type="checkbox"][id^="foo_"] as I read the http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1079646/jquery-multiple-selectors-select-items-which-match-both-criteria could work
[14:55:41] <dmnc> systemfault: tnx a lot for your help
[14:55:43] <misterm> LSshock_: pretty much any format will doo, but you probably want something like an object or an array
[14:55:47] <systemfault> dmnc: You're welcome :)
[14:55:57] <misterm> LSshock_: how you get the array or object doesn't matter
[14:56:07] <LSshock_> misterm: ok
[14:56:41] <noregret> guys, is there an input that can be changed to a non-input type? e.g. i have a text field, i enter some data then submit it using ajax, i want that data to stay in place, but the text field changes to a label or something. not sure if i'm clear on this...
[14:57:04] <LSshock_> still leaves me with one issue, my LI can be sorted but i havent figured out how to store the url into the LI (without turnin the title into a link)
[14:57:48] <djQuery> .seen deeply
[14:57:49] <hsbot> deeply was seen 2 minutes and 39 seconds ago, in #jquery, saying: i think i got everything
[14:58:07] <Deeply> hi
[14:58:09] <Deeply> sorry
[14:58:12] <outoftime> OK, let me put my question another way. In situations where one would use $node.attr('name', 'value') pre-1.6, is it recommended to use attr() or prop() in 1.6? or does it depend on the situation?
[14:58:16] <Deeply> took me a minute to find the window
[14:58:38] <misterm> noregret: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/HTMLInputElement
[14:59:27] <misterm> noregret: take a look at the various options, or you could always just copy the text from the input, remove the input element, and then add say, a div element in it's place with the text
[15:00:00] <noregret> misterm: any idea of a plugin that might exist for that purpose ?
[15:00:05] <crimlo> hey guys i want to use jquery to slide and div up and dow, but i want all the content within the div to move with the div also, how can i get that effect?
[15:00:14] <misterm> noregret: for what purpose?
[15:00:15] <crimlo> a**
[15:00:45] <noregret> misterm: what you said about copying the text
[15:01:08] <misterm> noregret: it'd be like 3 lines of code, a plugin would probably be overkill
[15:01:20] <Techdeck> hey guys, I have the following selector: $(".mainStoreViewTemplate .singleThumbnailItem") -- is there a way to make a selector that says everything that is a .singleThumbnailItem but NOT under mainStoreViewTemplate
[15:01:28] <noregret> thank
[15:01:31] <crimlo> can i get some help here please
[15:02:07] <phlp> Techdeck: $(".singleThumbnailItem:not(.mainStoreViewTemplate)")
[15:02:23] <Techdeck> will it still work with parent/child relationship?
[15:02:40] <phlp> oh i see, not under i thought you meant not having the class
[15:02:50] <Techdeck> :(
[15:03:11] <jinxdone> crimlo, the content of the div will move with the div.. nothing special needed
[15:03:21] <crimlo> no it will not
[15:03:31] <crimlo> its more like a masking effect
[15:03:35] <jinxdone> is the content positioned relative to the div?
[15:03:40] <crimlo> yes
[15:04:03] <crimlo> i'm using the toggle effect
[15:05:24] <jinxdone> do you have a sample i could take a look at?
[15:06:52] <crimlo> yes i'll put a sample online, give me 5 min please
[15:07:17] <phlp> Techdeck: $(".singleThumbnailItem").filter(".mainStoreViewTemplate .singleThumbnailItem")
[15:08:08] <Techdeck> thank you phlp
[15:09:11] <Techdeck> phlp, now for some reason it doesn't work at all
[15:09:17] <Techdeck> $(".ui-row-ltr").filter(".mainStoreViewTemplate .singleThumbnailItem").livequery("mouseenter", function(e) {
[15:09:21] <Techdeck> ... });
[15:10:04] <eldar> hi! I want to find a descendant of a certain jQuery node, which I already have. I know that jQuery has a selector $("ancestor descendant"), but in my case I already got the ancestor jQuery object, and I don't want to repeat it in the selector again. is there  some method that I can use in the following fashion: ancestor.descendant("descendant_selector"); ?
[15:10:24] <timmywil> ?find @ eldar
[15:10:25] <bot-t> eldar, .find(selector): Get the descendants of each element in the current set of matched elements, filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/find/
[15:10:59] <eldar> oh that's so obvious, thanks :)
[15:11:06] <timmywil> np
[15:11:18] <kryl> if I create template rows with : $.template( "movieTemplate", markup ); I want to know if I'll be able to use selector on class inside this rows ?
[15:11:46] <phlp> Techdeck: what about $(".ui-row-ltr .singleThumbnailItem").filter(".mainStoreViewTemplate .singleThumbnailItem").livequery
[15:11:55] <phlp> Techdeck: it's hard to say without seeing your html
[15:17:19] <LSshock_> How should i got about turning this into an array http://jsfiddle.net/973TR/1/ with which i can put it back the same way it looks now, later
[15:17:50] <Swedish_Soul> Hey, I'm in need of some help
[15:19:15] <Swedish_Soul> Hey, someone active here?
[15:19:38] <kojiro> Swedish_Soul: just ask
[15:20:01] <Swedish_Soul> I'm trying to create my own extension but it wont do as I want it to.
[15:21:04] <fairwinds> hi. I am looking for a recommendation for an internationalization lib / plugin
[15:21:49] <Swedish_Soul> kojiro: could you take a look at my code maybe?
[15:21:58] <Deeply> ? download jquery
[15:21:59] <bot-t> Deeply, Downloading jQuery - The code itself is written rather cleanly in an attempt to self-document. If you've spotted some areas of code that could be improved, please feel free to discuss it on the Development mailing list... http://docs.jquery.com/Downloading_jQuery
[15:22:25] <kojiro> Swedish_Soul: I'm kinda busy, but if you have a specific question or problem I might be able to help
[15:22:55] <fairwinds> have found this one: https://github.com/bryanwb/jquery-i18n
[15:23:19] <fairwinds> but would like to hear what folks are using
[15:23:22] <Swedish_Soul> Well, atm I'm writing the code in the html file (inside of <script>) but I'm not sure where to put my own extention
[15:23:28] <timmywil> LSshock_: http://jsfiddle.net/timmywil/973TR/2/  for toArray to work, you need to have ids
[15:24:02] <LSshock_> timmywil: aha! thanks
[15:24:08] <timmywil> np
[15:24:20] <kojiro> Swedish_Soul: can you create a demo on jsfiddle.net?
[15:24:36] <Deeply> ok
[15:24:41] <Deeply> minified?
[15:24:52] <Swedish_Soul> kojiro: don't know, gonna have a look
[15:25:24] <crimlo> hey jinx here's the sample http://www.tortugarestaurant.com/addons/os/sample.html
[15:25:43] <Swedish_Soul> kojiro, I'm gonna play around a bit here, thanks!
[15:26:03] <kojiro> Swedish_Soul: good luck
[15:27:13] <jinxdone> crimlo, ah, right. That's because it's animating the height of the div
[15:28:04] <crimlo> so take the height out?
[15:28:56] <crimlo> still that does not solve the problem
[15:30:52] <crimlo> can anyone help me with this please
[15:31:17] <LSshock_> i can't give them all a ID myself, this would have to be automatically and possibly based on the sorting, is this possible?
[15:32:22] <LSshock_> uhh just setting their ID's with numbers counting up should do
[15:32:35] <crimlo> can someone help me figure out how to scroll not only a div but also its content please
[15:32:52] <Swedish_Soul> I'm getting nowhere, could someone take a look at my code perhaps?
[15:33:02] <LSshock_> append('<li>' + $(this).parent().find('h2').text() + '<div class="invisiblink">'+ $(this).parent().find('.invisiblink').attr("href") +'</div></div></li>'); can i fit in <li id=" variable "> i keep getting errors
[15:33:14] <crimlo> swedish join the club buddy
[15:33:25] <Swedish_Soul> haha
[15:33:33] <coldhead> maybe you shoukld try easier problems?
[15:33:38] <Swedish_Soul> crimlo: you a newbi too?
[15:33:41] <coldhead> it's my first day using jQuery
[15:33:55] <kojiro> "please look at my code" means nothing unless you have a specific problem and you can't achieve it. Describe the problem first.
[15:34:02] <Swedish_Soul> colhead: mine too
[15:34:13] <kojiro> coldhead: time warp?
[15:34:50] <abjorn> boy AT&T, that sure is useful caller id. "Call from TEXAS"
[15:35:03] <LSshock_> ;D
[15:35:03] <Swedish_Soul> kojiro: I'm trying to achieve disabling a form field with my own extension but getting nowhere
[15:35:04] <kojiro> abjorn: yeah, that dude calls me too, sometimes
[15:35:08] <crimlo> yes bro i am
[15:35:11] <abjorn> that guy is a dick
[15:35:19] <crimlo> who is?
[15:35:25] <abjorn> YOU
[15:35:28] <kojiro> crimlo: the guy from TEXAS
[15:35:30] <crimlo> me>
[15:35:35] <crimlo> oh
[15:35:45] <crimlo> but why did adjon say i was
[15:35:48] <LSshock_> ./whois texas
[15:35:52] <kojiro> crimlo: because he's from TEXAS
[15:36:06] <crimlo> oh that explains a lot
[15:36:13] <abjorn> shh im not from texas what are you talking about
[15:36:15] <kojiro> Swedish_Soul: why your own extension?
[15:36:49] <LSshock_> how do i add a variable in as a id when creating an element
[15:37:03] <LSshock_> <div id="variable">
[15:37:16] <LSshock_> tried ' + ' stuff but not the right uhm.. combo yet
[15:37:16] <Swedish_Soul> It's a tutorial I'm trying to follow. Half is described as if I'm stupid the next as if I know everything. Maybe I should change tutorial. But it's just so that I'll learn
[15:37:42] <kryl> does anybody could help me with template ?
[15:37:51] <jinxdone> crimlo, I think jquery UI has a slide effect that does what you want
[15:38:54] <crimlo> will anyone even try to help me?
[15:39:04] <kojiro> crimlo: with what?
[15:39:53] <crimlo> i have a form in a div and i applied the toggle effect, i want the whole thing to scroll up and down, not just the div but all the content
[15:39:59] * kojiro is about 1 loose question away from dropping the catb how-to-ask-questions link
[15:40:12] <Jayflux> you have a link crimlo
[15:40:19] <crimlo> yes
[15:40:26] <Jayflux> go on then, show us
[15:40:44] <crimlo> http://www.tortugarestaurant.com/addons/os/sample.html
[15:41:11] <Jayflux> right whats the problem
[15:41:25] <crimlo> i want the whole thing to scroll not have that masking effect
[15:41:39] <Jayflux> you will need animate();
[15:41:48] <Jayflux> ?animate @ crimlo
[15:41:48] <bot-t> crimlo, .animate(properties, [duration], [easing], [callback]): Perform a custom animation of a set of CSS properties. http://api.jquery.com/animate/
[15:42:17] <crimlo> oh lord i am new here
[15:42:21] <crimlo> animate?
[15:42:24] <crimlo> how?
[15:42:32] <jinxdone> basically you need to wrap the div with another one that has overflow:hidden; and then just move the div outside the viewport.
[15:42:41] <jinxdone> jquery ui also has a ready made effect for this afaik
[15:43:00] <crimlo> jin paste url
[15:44:04] <crimlo> jinx can u please paste the url to what u just said
[15:44:45] <jinxdone> http://jqueryui.com/demos/effect/
[15:44:59] <jinxdone> http://jqueryui.com/download
[15:45:47] <Phoenixz> Its typical to add various event handlers in $(document).ready(function(){});  I have now 2 html pages that have 95% same event handlers, so I want to place these 95% in one common js file, and the 5% different handlers in other files. Problem here is, can I load 2 .js files that contain $(document).ready(function(){}); or will that cause conflicts (for example, the latter overwriting the first) ?
[15:46:08] <crimlo> jinx you are an asshole
[15:46:55] <jinxdone> crimlo, go buy yourself a good book on the subject or atleast get a time with an optician
[15:47:04] <kojiro> crimlo: wtf?
[15:47:13] <LSshock_> how do i add a variable in as a id when creating an element? <div id="movie + variable(number)">
[15:47:25] <Phoenixz> crimlo: sweet way to say "thanks" dude..
[15:47:29] <crimlo> you fools are no help
[15:47:33] <crimlo> fuck you all
[15:47:48] <Whirl3d> impatient much?
[15:47:49] <Phoenixz> sweeet
[15:47:51] <kojiro> LSshock_: $(your_el).attr(id, "movie " + variable(number))
[15:47:52] <noregret> var b = $(this).parent().clone().find('input[type="hidden"]').attr('value', 'test'); $(this).parent().after(b); is there something wrong with that ?
[15:47:55] <systemfault> Owww, I missed an asshole :/
[15:47:58] <Jayflux> christ, thats what we get for taking our time out to help?
[15:48:01] <systemfault> They're rare here.
[15:48:19] <kojiro> so sad
[15:48:27] <kojiro> I had days like that.
[15:48:32] <mts7> i appreciate you taking your time to help.  :-)
[15:48:45] <mts7> though no one has helped me yet, you help others, and that's great.
[15:48:50] <systemfault> kojiro: Then what happened? You discovered pr0n and it changed you?
[15:48:54] <kojiro> It's hard to realize you're really just frustrated at your own inability to learn shit.
[15:49:00] <systemfault> Ah, right
[15:49:05] <Jayflux> what's your problem mts7
[15:49:07] <kojiro> systemfault: no, I just have fewer days where I don't understand shit.
[15:49:17] <Whirl3d> Phoenix, you can have lots of .ready handlers, it's okay
[15:49:18] <mts7> IE is my problem
[15:49:18] <kojiro> systemfault: because I'm all bad-ass now.
[15:49:25] <Jayflux> IE is everyones problem
[15:49:26] <kojiro> mts7: IE is *everyone*'s problem
[15:49:29] <systemfault> kojiro: I'm at a point where I just say that I'm a noob at everything.
[15:49:31] <kojiro> Jayflux: nice
[15:49:34] <mts7> IE doesn't seem to like multiple AJAX requests
[15:50:05] <LSshock_> kojiro: thanks that did it
[15:50:16] <kojiro> LSshock_: yw
[15:50:24] <kojiro> Yay, I helped someone and it didn't suck for both of us!
[15:50:33] <LSshock_> haha
[15:50:41] <Jayflux> mts7 im off now but maybe kojiro can help you
[15:50:56] <mts7> Jayflux: thanks for listening.  :-D
[15:50:58] <kojiro> with IE? I'm on a Mac and don't have a VM handy :(
[15:51:04] <Whirl3d> Why is it that I can use a variable throughout a function, but passing it to the next function and it shows up as undefined? http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/H2HwH/2/
[15:51:26] <noregret> var b = $(this).parent().clone().find('input[type="hidden"]').attr('value', 'test'); $(this).parent().after(b); is there something wrong with that ? or am I not using cloning in the right way.. ?
[15:51:33] <Jayflux> mts7 post your problem in the jquery forum, that seems to get good response
[15:51:42] <Whirl3d> noregret, use jsfiddle, please
[15:52:05] <Phoenixz> Anyway, anybody here who can tell me if I can $(document).ready(function(){}); twice? or if I need to "extend" the contents of this function, how could I do this?
[15:52:25] <Whirl3d> phoenix, like I said, you can do it several times...
[15:52:46] <Whirl3d> Phoenix, even in th same script you could do it more than once
[15:53:26] <Phoenixz> Whirl3d: sorry, missed your reply
[15:53:33] <Whirl3d> np,
[15:53:42] <Phoenixz> Whirl3d: anyway, great, thanks!

[16:00:30] <Defusal> hi everyone
[16:00:52] <Defusal> does anyone have any idea why i would get Uncaught TypeError: Cannot call method 'replace' of undefined when trying to use http://loopj.com/jquery-tokeninput/ ?
[16:01:12] <noregret> is clone used in the wrong way? http://jsfiddle.net/noregret/6gaun/5/
[16:02:27] <misterm> Defusal: my guess would be you're truing to do var.replace() where var is undefined
[16:02:55] <Defusal> misterm, i tried the library with 1.6, 1.5.1, 1.4.0, etc
[16:03:09] <Defusal> no one else seems to be having an issue :/
[16:03:30] <misterm> Defusal: do you have an example that demonstrates your problem?
[16:04:00] <Defusal> misterm, live code or what?>
[16:04:28] <Deeply> jQuery I lost the URL you gave me
[16:07:33] <Whirl3d> anybody had any conflicts with easing in 1.6?
[16:09:51] <noregret> could someone please check the usage of clone in http://jsfiddle.net/noregret/6gaun/5/
[16:10:00] <kryl> is it possible to use jquery functions on  template rows  ($.tmpl)?
[16:10:33] <kryl> I want to use click functions on class in template from outside jquery code but without success ! any advices please?
[16:13:01] <Whirl3d> noregret, what are you trying to do
[16:13:11] <coldhead> ?p @ kryl
[16:13:12] <bot-t> kryl, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js or http://fixee.org/
[16:13:27] <coldhead> show us what you tried
[16:13:36] <noregret> clone that html block, change an attribute in it then insert it after it
[16:13:39] <Whirl3d> coldhead!
[16:13:40] <Lampoon> coldhead is great
[16:13:46] <noregret> Whirl3d: ^
[16:14:12] <Whirl3d> noregret, I am trying to figure out what you want to do. I saw your code.
[16:14:39] <noregret> Whirl3d: clone that html block, change an attribute in it then insert it after it
[16:15:03] <noregret> lol, lots of 'it's there..
[16:15:15] <noregret> am I clear enough ?
[16:15:23] <ch3mical> $('selector').clone().next('selector').insertAfter('original selector');
[16:15:59] <noregret> ch3mical: http://jsfiddle.net/noregret/6gaun/5/
[16:16:08] <ch3mical> Replace selectors with the selector to match the HTML element to clone, then the selector of the item inside the cloned element to change attr in then original selector
[16:16:14] <ch3mical> Oh, I forgot the .attr()
[16:16:33] <ch3mical> $('selector').clone().next('selector').attr('blah','something').insertAfter('original selector');
[16:17:12] <Whirl3d> ch3mical, easy for you to say. LOL (sounds like a mouthful. lol)
[16:17:17] <noregret> ch3mical: that's what i've done..
[16:18:02] <noregret> in firebug, it shows that only the <input> with the changed attrib is being inserted, and not the whole clone...
[16:18:14] <noregret> wth..
[16:18:41] <Whirl3d> noregret, try using .appendTo($(this).parent()) after the line ending in test.
[16:18:53] <kryl> coldhead, http://fixee.org/paste/72rmizw/
[16:19:13] <kryl> it's not exactly the code but you will understand I think
[16:19:22] <Deeply> how do i get an url back that i lost on jsfiddle?
[16:19:23] <ch3mical> http://jsfiddle.net/6gaun/7/
[16:19:38] <ch3mical> noregret: No it isn't ;)
[16:20:06] <ch3mical> Whirl3d: ;)
[16:20:22] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/wNQvX/2/
[16:20:43] <Swaagie> probably idiotic, but I created an array (literal) inside a jquery function which I can dump to the console.log, but as soon as I try to access an element with [] I'm returned undefined
[16:20:54] <noregret> ch3mical: lol, what did i do wrong? i only chained them..
[16:21:14] <noregret> Whirl3d: hmm
[16:21:26] <Deeply> ?
[16:21:31] <ryanneufed> anyone know how to detect mediaquery support? Modernizr doesn't appear to have it built in at the moment
[16:21:34] <ch3mical> noregret: you were trying to assign the variable to the wrong functions, first of all, then using the variable wrong
[16:21:59] <Whirl3d> swaagie, put it in a jsfiddle, please
[16:22:05] <Deeply> how do i get an url back that i lost on jsfiddle?
[16:22:19] <Whirl3d> Deeply, did you setup an account?
[16:22:24] <Deeply> no
[16:22:26] <ryanneufed> Deeply: sign up for an account so you don't lose them next time
[16:22:31] <Deeply> djQuery pasted it to me
[16:22:36] <ryanneufed> check browser history?
[16:22:39] <coldhead> kryl: http://fixee.org/paste/0koalvg
[16:22:39] <Deeply> did
[16:22:41] <Deeply> not there
[16:22:41] <coldhead> ?live @ kryl
[16:22:42] <bot-t> kryl, .live(eventType, handler): Attach a handler to the event for all elements which match the current selector, now or in the future. http://api.jquery.com/live/
[16:24:02] <ch3mical> noregret: if you want to retain the click event, use this one: http://jsfiddle.net/6gaun/8/
[16:24:11] <ch3mical> Using .live() instead of .click()
[16:24:25] <ch3mical> Then every button can clone itself
[16:24:34] <noregret> ch3mical: i still don't get what was wrong, is it this: $(this).parent().clone().find('input[type="hidden"]').attr('value', 'test'); ?
[16:25:10] <kryl> coldhead, you're the one ;-)
[16:25:27] <Whirl3d> why is it that I can access a file via ajax using the full url--but only if the source is in the same directory as it's content? As soon as I change directories, it messes up?
[16:25:31] <coldhead> no YOU'RE the one
[16:25:32] <ch3mical> noregret: the .find() was only finding on the first element
[16:25:46] <ch3mical> Which is why I used find on var c instead
[16:25:58] <noregret> ch3mical: u mean finding on the parent() ?
[16:25:59] <ch3mical> To make it actually find on the new element
[16:26:15] <ch3mical> Not the parent, the original
[16:26:36] <noregret> ch3mical: so find can not be chained ?
[16:26:53] <ch3mical> Sure, but the way you chained it only led it to find items in the first element
[16:27:00] <ch3mical> Not the cloned one
[16:27:09] <noregret> the $(this) ?
[16:27:17] <ch3mical> Plus you had .after() instead of .insertAfter()
[16:27:38] <noregret> but why? it makes sense, parent->clone->fine
[16:27:42] <noregret> find *
[16:27:43] <ch3mical> No, the first input[type=hidden]
[16:29:18] <Whirl3d> does jquery ajax rewrite the url you pass to it? and could it be messing up?
[16:29:56] <ch3mical> Whirl3d: it adds the query string only
[16:30:44] <Whirl3d> ch3mical, I am begging you to help me figure this out. It should be a simple thing and I have been trying to fix it for 3 days with no luck....
[16:31:01] <Deeply> Whirl3d sounds like me :)
[16:31:05] <ch3mical> noregret: the reason is because you cloned the elements but didn't attach them to the DOM, so .find() won't find anything when it's chained that way (because it's not in the DOM)
[16:31:15] <ch3mical> Whirl3d: post it
[16:31:52] <noregret> and what's wrong with $(this).parent().after(cloned block) ? it seems logical to insert the block after the selector
[16:31:57] <noregret> ch3mical: ^
[16:32:48] <noregret> ch3mical: e.preventDefault is the same as "return false" ?
[16:33:01] <ch3mical> noregret: You're using .after() incorrectly.. it's used like .after('some HTML here'), not $(element).after(another element)
[16:33:12] <noregret> ah
[16:33:17] <noregret> my bad :)
[16:33:18] <ch3mical> noregret: no, it prevents the submit button from submitting anything, no exactly the same
[16:33:53] <noregret> ch3mical: that's what i was trying to do with return false
[16:33:55] <ch3mical> http://api.jquery.com/after/ for reference
[16:33:56] <noregret> seems no need for it
[16:34:09] <ch3mical> I didn't even notice you had a return false there ;p
[16:35:08] <noregret> lol
[16:35:19] <noregret> then what's the difference between the two ?
[16:35:40] <ch3mical> noregret: The button was probably doing nothing anyway, because there isn't a form in your example, but preventDefault is the proper way to do that
[16:35:43] <Whirl3d> ch3mical, here is the jquery (which of course doesn't work because it's all ajax, but you can see the code at least) http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/wNQvX/3/
[16:35:45] <noregret> is the first used for hte bubbling effect
[16:35:48] <Deeply> heh I'll have to wait for djquery to get back
[16:36:09] <Whirl3d> Deeply, what is the problem?
[16:36:22] <Deeply> I lost an URL he pasted to me in a private window
[16:36:42] <Deeply> he converted a project of mine to jquery
[16:36:46] <Whirl3d> Drats. I have the log from the entire day...but that won't help
[16:37:40] <ch3mical> Whirl3d: it's just this one ajax?
[16:37:52] <Whirl3d> yep
[16:37:58] <Whirl3d> Just refuses to work.
[16:38:31] <Whirl3d> I have literally recoded and refactored the thing 50 times and it just won't grab identical content in a directory right next to it.
[16:38:58] <ch3mical> BTW I believe SOP is what prevents you from putting your menu file in a different directory
[16:39:03] <ch3mical> It has to be in the same or subdir
[16:39:27] <Whirl3d> But I don't get any errors
[16:40:07] <Whirl3d> and wtf is up with SOP? Such a stupid thing
[16:40:09] <ch3mical> Then I'm not sure... what does the error say when you run this?
[16:40:15] <Whirl3d> no error
[16:40:21] <Whirl3d> just doesn't return the contents
[16:40:39] <Whirl3d> if its in the same directory, i get the content--no problems
[16:41:00] <ch3mical> Try this: http://jsfiddle.net/wNQvX/4/
[16:41:07] <ch3mical> See if that throws any error
[16:41:40] <Deeply> http://jsfiddle.net/RgaSD/1/
[16:41:45] <michaelt1> is there anything like java char arithmetic in JavaScript?
[16:41:45] <Deeply> i pasted my old code there
[16:41:47] <ch3mical> This is hard to do without being able to run it, lol
[16:43:14] <Cfoo> Were can i set timezone in Weekcalendar? It automaticly chooses GMT+02 and php date function is converting to my timezone GMT+01...
[16:43:57] <eddiemonge> Cfoo: are you asking in the right room?
[16:43:57] <Whirl3d> http://www.ldwolfe.net/ourfirm/sectionTest-6.html
[16:44:13] <Whirl3d> now at least it says ERROR: object object
[16:45:03] <Whirl3d> ch3mical, if I change the script to say loadSection ("ourfirm")  it works
[16:45:17] <Deeply> while I'm waiting I'll try to see if I can remember anything i saw on the screen and try to modify this old code again
[16:46:13] <Swaagie> Whirl3d: http://jsfiddle.net/NLuxb/2/ sorry lost connection ;
[16:46:16] <molavy> how can i return id from an element
[16:46:18] <molavy> ?
[16:46:18] <eddiemonge> Whirl3d: you should really cache $(this)
[16:46:21] <Swaagie> the print outside the jquery works fine, inside it is undefined
[16:46:25] <Cfoo> eddiemonge: I dont know? weekcalendar is writen in Jquery so i figured...
[16:46:36] <Whirl3d> ch3mical, you can call it from console. But the directories all contain a contents.html:  home, ourfirm, yourcase, contact
[16:47:11] <eddiemonge> Cfoo: link?
[16:47:13] <phlp> Whirl3d, it's a 404 http://www.ldwolfe.net/yourcase/contents.html
[16:47:29] <molavy> i want know what id clicked inside a div
[16:47:33] <molavy> how can i return id from an element?
[16:47:46] <Cfoo> eddiemonge: https://github.com/robmonie/jquery-week-calendar/wiki/
[16:48:05] <eddiemonge> molavy: $(this).id or $(this)[0].id. i forget which
[16:49:07] <eddiemonge> Cfoo: have you read https://github.com/themouette/jquery-week-calendar/wiki?
[16:49:39] <Deeply> can one edit inside this jsfiddle window or is it not possible?
[16:49:57] <Cfoo> eddiemonge: Yes ofcourse, i see "Timezone O" but i dont know were to put it...
[16:50:24] <phlp> Deeply, after you edit click the Run button
[16:50:25] <Whirl3d> phlp, it's there if you browse to it directly
[16:50:39] <ch3mical> Whirl3d: so... for instance your menu_url should be http://www.ldwolfe.net/yourcase/contents.html right?
[16:50:46] <ch3mical> Unless you're running it local
[16:50:56] <molavy> thank you
[16:51:02] <phlp> Whirl3d, not for me it isnt.. ourfirm isnt either
[16:51:09] <Deeply> it's not letting me edit the code
[16:52:35] <noregret> ch3mical: http://jsfiddle.net/noregret/6gaun/13/ i'm trying to disable the fields in the first block , but it's not working out
[16:52:55] <Whirl3d> that was really wierd. I am getting a 404 error now too
[16:52:59] <ch3mical> Jeez I'm getting question by name now ;p
[16:53:15] <Whirl3d> but I just did it a second ago with no problems.
[16:53:29] <noregret> ch3mical: oh yeah ;)
[16:53:53] <ch3mical> Have you tried using the :first selector?
[16:53:58] <jaequery> i wish i can view websites through irc
[16:54:26] <jaequery> don't you?
[16:55:34] <noregret> ch3mical: no, because i just want to disable it to the block directly before it
[16:56:10] <Deeply> rats
[16:56:12] <Cfoo> eddiemonge: Fixed it! Thanks
[16:56:44] <phlp> noregret, b.find(':input[name^="data"]').attr('disabled', 'disabled');
[16:56:45] <ch3mical> noregret: I don't think you can disable an entire block, but you could iterate over a group of elements if you wrap it in a div or something
[16:57:10] <ch3mical> phlp: what's that : doing in there?
[16:57:28] <phlp> input doesnt select the textarea but :input will
[16:57:28] <noregret> ch3mical: yeah, i meant a couple of elements, just like what i'm trying to do
[16:57:30] <Whirl3d> it seems to be coming and going....?
[16:57:37] <ch3mical> phlp: interesting
[16:57:48] <Whirl3d> http://www.ldwolfe.net/yourcase/contents.html
[16:58:00] <Deeply> http://jsfiddle.net/RgaSD/2/
[16:58:07] <ch3mical> noregret: Try what phlp said, but put .not(c) in there before the .attr
[16:58:31] <ch3mical> To you don't disable the new one, which I assume is your intent
[16:58:37] <ch3mical> to=so
[16:58:54] <noregret> ch3mical: exactly, thanks
[16:59:21] <phlp> it wont disable c
[16:59:23] <Whirl3d> I'm gonna switch hosts...any suggestions?
[16:59:55] <Deeply> hosts?
[17:00:23] <jaequery> anyone know any good alternative to something like chef?
[17:00:25] <phlp> noregret, you should just do b.find(':input').attr('disabled', 'disabled');
[17:00:25] <ch3mical> Whirl3d: did you update something?
[17:00:59] <phlp> noregret, that will include the submit button too
[17:01:04] <noregret> phlp: actually, i want the hidden field to stay enabled, since it will contain an ID that must be POSTed
[17:01:09] <ch3mical> phlp: You're right, I hadn't seen that you began it with "b."
[17:01:16] <ch3mical> Reading too fast :)
[17:01:24] <noregret> phlp: and i will remove the button totally
[17:01:54] <ch3mical> noregret: by the way, I have no idea what you're trying to accomplish here, lol
[17:02:13] <noregret> ch3mical: adding comments :D
[17:02:17] <sullivan0> just released jQueryUI + LessCss on sourceforge... simply put allowing use of jQueryUI theming without invasive jQUI classes
[17:03:54] <noregret> can I only select the text input and the textarea ?
[17:04:03] <noregret> at the same time i mean
[17:04:41] <Swaagie> how come I can't write the step from the for loop inside the function in http://jsfiddle.net/NLuxb/4/
[17:05:32] <phlp> noregret, b.find('input[type="text"], textarea').attr('disabled', 'disabled');

[17:06:32] <bluekite2000> i have a default image on my site using prependTo. above the default image are 3 thumbnails. How do I detect mouseover on the thumbnail so I can replace the default image with the full size image of the thumbnail?
[17:06:40] <Swaagie> ch3mical: good question :P
[17:06:49] <Swaagie> dunno caught up in the process I guess
[17:07:09] <molavy> function confirmbox(object){
[17:07:24] <molavy> $("object #confirmbox [type=button]").click(
[17:07:40] <molavy> i created a function named it confirmbox
[17:07:47] <ch3mical> Swaagie:  http://jsfiddle.net/NLuxb/5/
[17:07:50] <ch3mical> Is that what you want?
[17:08:44] <kryl> coldhead, other bug : http://fixee.org/paste/0koalvg#url=kt3qn12 < I want to get next input value when I click on the a link in the previous example. still locked (I need to sleep ...)
[17:09:02] <molavy> i want send an element to it and it add  a div conirmbox and if user click on yes return 1 else 0
[17:09:33] <Swaagie> ch3mical: yep, but the index still ain't printed correctly, only 0
[17:09:38] <molavy> 		newconfirmbox= $("#confirmbox").clone();	$(object).after(newconfirmbox);
[17:09:50] <ch3mical> Swaagie: what is it supposed to print?
[17:09:59] <ch3mical> Or what are you expecting, I should say
[17:10:14] <djQuery> Deeply: http://jsfiddle.net/uWyA7/
[17:10:25] <Deeply> ah, thank you
[17:10:31] <molavy> is this selector correct: function confirmbox(object){ $("object #confirmbox [type=button]").click(
[17:10:37] <Deeply> dj: try this
[17:10:48] <ch3mical> molavy: no
[17:10:52] <Deeply> it's the old code but it will show you what I'm trying to do
[17:11:06] <Swaagie> ch3mical: the value of the current index of the stepElements
[17:11:14] <djQuery> molavy: no its not there is not element called object
[17:11:29] <Deeply> http://jsfiddle.net/RgaSD/2/
[17:11:30] <molavy> how can i do it?
[17:11:36] <Swaagie> but I simplified the content of the function somewhat for easier troubleshooting
[17:11:38] <Deeply> in the barcode box type ID|PW@
[17:11:40] <ch3mical> document.writeln(stepElements[index]);
[17:12:02] <zjk> what differences between toggle() in jquery and toggle() in jquery UI ?
[17:12:02] <blindMoe> molavy: $(object).children('#confirmbox[type=button]').click( ...  <-- something like that
[17:12:06] <eddiemonge> molavy: first, i would use a name other than object
[17:12:12] <djQuery> $('input#confirmbox:button).click(    but u know what $('#confirmbox').click .... should be fine
[17:12:16] <Swaagie> ch3mical: ye ok, but why is the output currently 0, while I would expect 0 1 2 3 4 5 ..
[17:12:36] <ch3mical> Swaagie: for me it prints a list of numbers
[17:13:14] <ch3mical> If I change that .writeln to .writeln(stepElements[index]) it prints the list itself
[17:13:30] <molavy> but this code is dynamic ,sometime for delete confirm and sometime for change confirm
[17:13:30] <Deeply> ok i have your url up djQuery, how do i get that to my machine?
[17:13:40] <Swaagie> ch3mical: weird shit

[17:14:57] <djQuery> jquery first then the new file
[17:15:06] <Deeply> i tried the run on the site, but that code doesn't do what mine was doing
[17:15:20] <Deeply> ok so copy the js to a new js file ok
[17:15:21] <djQuery> how so
[17:15:22] <Deeply> one second
[17:15:36] <sullivan0> (good luck djQuery :P)
[17:15:43] <Deeply> let me find the url to what I did
[17:16:00] <djQuery> sullivan0: the demo works my job is done
[17:16:13] <wafflesburger> hi, is jquery kewl?  i heard it was
[17:16:17] <Deeply> http://jsfiddle.net/RgaSD/2/
[17:16:28] <Swaagie> ch3mical: http://jsfiddle.net/NLuxb/8/ did not change anything other than the stepElements[index]
[17:16:28] <Deeply> in the barcode box, put ID|PW@
[17:16:38] <sullivan0> hrhr but I bet when he comes back you will be tempted to walk him through just so he can see it working
[17:16:43] <coldhead> ?p  @ wafflesburger
[17:16:43] <bot-t> wafflesburger, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js or http://fixee.org/
[17:16:44] <Deeply> you should get a message window that pops up
[17:16:46] <sullivan0> @ djQuery
[17:17:00] <sullivan0> hrhr but I bet when he comes back you will be tempted to walk him through just so he can see it working @ djQuery
[17:17:00] <Swaagie> it prints the first element, but not all
[17:17:19] <ch3mical> Swaagie: http://jsfiddle.net/NLuxb/9/
[17:17:33] <wafflesburger> coldhead; what?
[17:17:41] <djQuery> sullivan0: he can see the demo workin
[17:18:15] <djQuery> and its dinner time
[17:18:15] <Swaagie> ch3mical:  now I do see the complete list
[17:18:18] <sullivan0> ahh okies djQuery
[17:18:36] <Deeply> ok do i need the html off the site too or is that the same?
[17:18:58] <ch3mical> Swaagie: browser was caching possibly, I dunno, very odd
[17:20:09] <scikidus> has anyone here coded with multiple autocomplete fields before?
[17:20:19] <scikidus> (hello, by the way)
[17:20:26] <eddiemonge> scikidus: yes
[17:21:13] <scikidus> is there some quick fix other than .each() to get all autocomplete fields to accept the formatting in _renderItem?
[17:21:46] <scikidus> right now only the first autocomplete field adopts the formatting, and the rest default
[17:21:52] <ChrisPitzer> I'm having an issue where my delegate>change is firing twice instead of once per change in ie 8 and 9.
[17:22:12] <ChrisPitzer> i found people talking about this being an issue with jquery 1.4... but i'm experiencing the problem in 1.6
[17:22:33] <djQuery> Deeply: I removed all the inline crap that was in the form
[17:22:51] <djQuery> copy paste file comparision
[17:22:57] <djQuery> l*trs
[17:23:08] <ChrisPitzer> anyone know if this is a common issue, or if there are any good workarounds?
[17:23:21] <Deeply> huh?
[17:23:25] <eddiemonge> ?pe @ scikidus
[17:23:26] <bot-t> scikidus, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ otherwise I won't look at it.
[17:23:34] <scikidus> working on that now
[17:23:45] <sullivan0> l8rs djQuery
[17:23:49] <eddiemonge> ?pe @ ChrisPitzer
[17:23:50] <bot-t> ChrisPitzer, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ otherwise I won't look at it.
[17:23:51] <Deeply> I don't know what you mean by inline
[17:24:01] <Swaagie> ch3mical: thanks works like a charm! awesome, can go to sleep quietly now ;)
[17:24:04] <molavy> how can select all form with this id's :form1 ,form2,form3,...
[17:24:08] <molavy> ?
[17:24:40] <eddiemonge> molavy: ids are unique. there should only be one id per form
[17:24:52] <phlp> Deeply, he means all the onchange="..." onkeypress="..." in the html
[17:25:23] <wafflesburger> hi is jquery robust enough for production use??
[17:25:28] <ch3mical> swaenjoy
[17:25:35] <Deeply> phlp: thank you
[17:25:36] <ch3mical> oops
[17:25:38] <sullivan0> molavy $(form[id*=form]) I think (css attribute selector might be wrong)
[17:25:45] <Deeply> though I'm curious as to why
[17:25:52] <sullivan0> ....
[17:26:03] <ch3mical> Deeply: redundant uneeded code
[17:26:04] <eddiemonge> sullivan0: molavy no wrong. should be $('#form1')
[17:26:20] <Deeply> ok so take that code and paste it where my form code is?
[17:26:33] <sullivan0> eddiemonge: he asked for forms with id containing form#
[17:26:37] <Deeply> or just make mine look the same?
[17:26:41] <ch3mical> Later dudes
[17:26:54] <eddiemonge> molavy: again, use classes
[17:27:03] <ChrisPitzer> here's my delegate with the odd ie8/ie9 behavior... http://jsfiddle.net/nA8qr/
[17:27:13] <sullivan0> eddiemonge $(form[id*=form]) will select all forms with the string 'form' in the id
[17:27:58] <eddiemonge> i dont think thats what is being asked based on past questions
[17:27:59] <sullivan0> well I missed some ' ... molavy $('form[id*=form]')
[17:28:00] <molavy> there are unique,form1 for form number 1 and ...
[17:28:28] <sullivan0> how can "how can select all form with this id's :form1 ,form2,form3,..." be any clearer
[17:29:36] <eddiemonge> ChrisPitzer: why not bind to the click event since a click on a checkbox is normally a change event?
[17:31:09] <ChrisPitzer> eddiemonge: tab then space also changes a checkbox
[17:31:21] <ChrisPitzer> :-/ accessability
[17:32:02] <eddiemonge> ChrisPitzer: youre right. i forgot about those.

[17:32:10] <benji_> Hi, is there a way to submit a form in ajax with jQuery ?
[17:32:33] <Brodingo> probs
[17:33:07] <Deeply> ok i made my form look like his, here goes.....
[17:33:08] <Brodingo> ?ajax
[17:33:09] <bot-t> jQuery.ajax(settings): Perform an asynchronous HTTP (Ajax) request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[17:33:56] <benji_> So is there a way to build the querystring easily ?
[17:34:11] <benji_> from an existing form
[17:34:20] <jovrtn> benji_: take a look at serialize()
[17:34:24] <benji_> ok
[17:34:29] <scikidus> eddiemonge: make that http://jsfiddle.net/faLAr/7/ -- note that auto complete is formatted in the first box, btu not int he other two
[17:34:31] <Deeply> hmmm i think i have to include the jquery-1.6.min.js at the top of my form
[17:34:40] <Cfoo> My script freezes becouse of the time variables "start" and "end".. Why? http://pastie.org/1891233
[17:35:05] <benji_> jovrtn, Brodingo : thanks guys :)
[17:35:10] <jovrtn> np
[17:35:47] <Cfoo> When I "alert(start)" it says "Wed May 11 2011 09:45:00 GMT+0200"
[17:36:05] <Deeply> Nope
[17:36:08] <Deeply> didn't work
[17:37:32] <eddiemonge> Cfoo: alert is not a debugging tool
[17:37:39] <eddiemonge> use console.log
[17:38:06] <Cfoo> What is console.log? I have firebug if it helps..
[17:38:25] <Cfoo> Ohh sorry i see
[17:38:44] <eddiemonge> scikidus: why are you using such old versions?

[17:40:35] <Cfoo> Thanks for link
[17:40:42] <Deeply> ok so just copy his jscript or just replace my routine with his?
[17:41:47] <Deeply> ?
[17:42:33] <eddiemonge> scikidus: runs just fine: http://jsfiddle.net/eddiemonge/faLAr/10/ your code needs some work
[17:43:42] <scikidus> eddiemonge: the autocomplete runs, yes; the issue is that the formatting inside the suggestion list is lost after the first autocompletion field
[17:43:54] <feathersanddown> how do I select with id tag??? $('#id_name') ???
[17:43:59] <scikidus> http://jsfiddle.net/faLAr/9/
[17:44:17] <Deeply> well i copied his jscript into my file but now it's broken
[17:44:33] <Cfoo> Can you send a date variable trough $.post ?
[17:45:14] <eddiemonge> scikidus: you know you are calling autocomplete twice in your code?

[17:46:17] <kryl> ciao and thank you again coldhead
[17:46:44] <coldhead> you're welcome
[17:47:25] <Deeply> heh, more coffee
[17:47:26] <scikidus> eddiemonge: where? it's virtually identical at this point to the code in http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/#custom-data
[17:47:27] <Cfoo> Thats odd, "end = calEvent.end;" freezes and "end = calEvent.end.getTime();" works but outputs it all wrong..
[17:47:35] <Deeply> i knew I'd screw this up somehow hehehehehehe
[17:47:41] <eddiemonge> scikidus: top and bottom
[17:50:15] <feathersanddown> time ago my firebug can output everything I select with jquery, now show me nothing, some have happened same thing ?
[17:50:37] <scikidus> eddiemonge: are .date("autocomplete") and .autocomplete() overlapping then? becuase what i have on http://jsfiddle.net/faLAr/9/ seems identical to the jquery ui implementation in the demo
[17:50:56] <Deeply> looks like this is going to be another all nighter
[17:51:08] <eddiemonge> scikidus: thats different than what you had before
[17:52:11] <scikidus> eddiemonge: my apologies for the confusion; the seocnd autocomplete in the version you were looking at deals with something else and as the /9/ version shows isn't related to the issue
[17:52:41] <scikidus> try hittign the down arrow while focused in the first and second larger fields
[17:52:48] <scikidus> the first one is formatted
[17:52:50] <scikidus> the second, not
[17:54:22] <Deeply> can I do this?
[17:54:33] <Deeply>  <script type="text/javascript" src="jquery-1.6.min.js"></script>
[17:54:33] <Deeply>  <script type="text/javascript" src="demo1.js"></script>
[17:55:09] <eddiemonge> why wouldnt you be able to?
[17:55:31] <phlp> scikidus, http://jsfiddle.net/faLAr/11/
[17:55:37] <Deeply> I just realized I didn't have that in and wasn't sure if I could have them both in there
[17:57:01] <scikidus> eddiemonge: which is what i arrived at originally, so that's good :D just curious though: is there any way to do it without the .each()?
[17:57:08] <eddiemonge> scikidus http://jsfiddle.net/eddiemonge/faLAr/12/
[17:57:09] <scikidus> that seems like a buf
[17:57:21] <eddiemonge> scikidus: lol i just added the each in
[17:57:21] <Deeply> ok so do I replace my barcode routine with his?
[17:57:28] <eddiemonge> ?data
[17:57:29] <bot-t> .data(key, value): Store arbitrary data associated with the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/data/
[17:57:40] <eddiemonge> Deeply: huh?
[17:57:54] <Deeply> djquery wrote something for me
[17:58:09] <eddiemonge> scikidus: "We can set several distinct values for a single element"
[17:58:24] <Deeply> mine does what it's supposed to do, but his behaves differently on the site and doesn't work at all on my local machine
[17:58:56] <a_L_p> can anyone out there tell me how I can I add timing to toggleClass()? I am trying toggleClass('item', 500), and getting nothing...
[18:01:25] <eddiemonge> a_L_p: setTimeout
[18:01:41] <misterm> a_L_p: are you using jQuery UI?
[18:02:01] <a_L_p> eddiemonge: how do I do that?
[18:02:11] <a_L_p> misterm: yes
[18:02:13] <eddiemonge> a_L_p: you dont know how to use setTimeout?
[18:02:26] <misterm> a_L_p: pastebin your code?
[18:02:27] <scikidus> alright, i'm off; eddie thanks for your help
[18:03:23] <Deeply> ok so I'm supposed to make my html look like his, and remove the onclick= stuff and change out my barcode routine for his
[18:03:25] <Deeply> i tried that
[18:03:29] <Deeply> and I broke it
[18:03:39] <a_L_p> misterm: http://d.pr/fwGi
[18:05:24] <eddiemonge> Deeply: time to hire a developer?

[18:05:48] <Deeply> i'm supposed to be the developer....
[18:06:20] <Deeply> i got it to work with help from friends in javascript only to be told that they need it to work with jquery since that's what everything else on their server is using
[18:06:27] <Kre10s> hello\
[18:06:43] <eddiemonge> a_L_p: if you have jqui then that should work
[18:07:01] <misterm> a_L_p: what part is not working, the animation or the toggling of class?
[18:07:11] <a_L_p> the animation
[18:07:49] <misterm> a_L_p: and you're using jquery ui, not just jquery?
[18:07:57] <Kre10s> I have an element.. foo.. that is a child of bar. if bar has been hidden with hide() how can I tell if foo is hidden?
[18:08:29] <eddiemonge> Kre10s: is(':visible')
[18:08:52] * Deeply needs more coffee
[18:09:36] <a_L_p> misterm: just confirmed I have jquery ui being called too
[18:09:49] <a_L_p> misterm: would there be a version requirement
[18:09:52] <a_L_p> ?
[18:10:02] <Deeply> eddiemonge: here's his
[18:10:04] <Deeply> http://jsfiddle.net/uWyA7/
[18:10:23] <eddiemonge> a_L_p: do you have a link to your site?
[18:10:37] <a_L_p> misterm: it's a local dev
[18:11:07] <misterm> a_L_p: most be something off
[18:11:22] <misterm> a_L_p: if you can create a working test case Im sure someone can help you
[18:11:50] <a_L_p> misterm: thanks, I think I will just go for a workaround using toggle for now..
[18:11:58] <a_L_p> misterm: I appreciate our time
[18:12:20] <eddiemonge> so instead of trying to figure out how to fix it, you are going to do a harder workaround?
[18:12:23] <Kre10s> eddiemonge, hmm... im doing this..
[18:14:09] <Cfoo> I cant understand why it's not passing the time variable when im not using getTime, anyone please?
[18:14:43] <Kre10s> eddiemonge, I get errors... elem.nodeName is undefined from deep within jquery
[18:14:55] <eddiemonge> Kre10s: paste your code see ? pe
[18:14:55] <bot-t> Kre10s, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ otherwise I won't look at it.
[18:15:03] <eddiemonge> Cfoo: you too with the code pasting
[18:15:18] <Deeply> http://jsfiddle.net/uWyA7/
[18:15:20] <Deeply> that's his
[18:15:21] <Deeply> http://jsfiddle.net/deeplyshrouded/Nvutn/
[18:15:24] <Deeply> that's mine
[18:16:56] <eddiemonge> Deeply: whats the problem? besides one using jquery
[18:17:01] <feathersanddown> is there a way to discard elements with a logic operator  ?? i have a list of <td>, <td>, <td>, <td>, <td> .... and want to select only that those .html() (a number) be less than 0
[18:17:07] <Deeply> in mine, if you type ID|PW@ it automatically fills in the other 2 fields
[18:17:15] <Deeply> and brings up a dialog box
[18:17:42] <Deeply> that works fine
[18:17:55] <Deeply> I was told, I need to convert that to use jQuery.
[18:18:24] <Deeply> djQuery wrote the code on the other url, but it doesn't do the same thing and I don't know what to do with it.
[18:19:33] <eddiemonge> Deeply: you have to add the keydown logic that looks for the @ symbol and then autopopulate the other fields. If you have this working already, why are you converting it to jQuery?
[18:19:38] <Cfoo> http://jsfiddle.net/gyYHD/
[18:20:25] <Deeply> because the person that hired me wants me to.
[18:20:40] <eddiemonge> but you dont know jquery?
[18:20:51] <V1AN2> jQuery doesn't take long to adapt to
[18:20:51] <Deeply> I don't even know javascript.
[18:20:53] <V1AN2> meh
[18:21:09] <Deeply> this was dumped on me because i'm a vb programmer.
[18:21:20] <Fighterlegend> haha, don't you hate that?
[18:21:22] <eddiemonge> Cfoo: ok so whats the problem?
[18:21:28] <Deeply> Yes. I honestly do.
[18:21:36] <eddiemonge> Deeply: then why did you get hired to do JS development if you dont know JS?
[18:21:55] <eddiemonge> you should hire someone who actually knows JS
[18:21:58] <Deeply> because i'm the only one available.
[18:22:09] <Deeply> well, my JS code works
[18:22:29] <Deeply> after messing around with it for 4 days with some help from a few friends of mine, i finally got it to work.
[18:22:39] <Deeply> then I got told it has to use jquery
[18:23:19] <Cfoo> start.String is not a function
[18:23:19] <Cfoo> [] $.post("calendar.php?action=move_ev...start.String(), end: end.String() },
[18:23:32] <eddiemonge> Deeply: spend the $100 and get it done right
[18:23:34] <Fighterlegend> Deeply: People really need to elaborate on their requests
[18:23:39] <Deeply> but like I said, i have a vb pocket reference that says, this is vb6 syntax, this is vb.net syntax
[18:23:42] <Cfoo> It the block im trying to move freezes
[18:23:52] <Deeply> so I can easily convert while I learn the .net format
[18:24:40] <Cfoo> Is it alright eddymonge to pm you the url so u can se for your self what i mean?
[18:25:04] <eddiemonge> sure although if its on the web why does it have to be private?
[18:28:13] <eddiemonge> Cfoo: why are you trying to do .String()?
[18:29:56] <Cfoo> I dont know that i am... Not in the code? can it do that by default?
[18:30:05] <eddiemonge> it is in the code. search for it
[18:30:21] <Cfoo> Line 95: $.post("calendar.php?action=move_event", { id: id, start: start, end: end },
[18:30:40] <eddiemonge> Cfoo: keep going. thats not the line doing the work
[18:33:01] <Cfoo> eddiemonge: sorry I forgot to save when i deleted it.. Now theres acctual problem
[18:35:50] <Cfoo> this.setHours is not a function
[18:35:57] <Kre10s> eddiemonge, http://jsfiddle.net/DETGL/
[18:36:09] <eddiemonge> Cfoo: your code is all crazy
[18:37:00] <Cfoo> eddiemonge: Haha what do you mean x)
[18:37:51] <Kre10s> eddiemonge, I see you haven't read mine yet...
[18:38:41] <eddiemonge> Cfoo: i would recommend going through and cleaning it up and adding the pieces in one at a time to find out what is really causing the issue and why
[18:39:05] <Kre10s> eddiemonge, forget it... i found it.
[18:40:41] <Cfoo> eddiemonge: But this cant be a big problem, adding events works fine. Just editing them that causes this headache.
[18:43:46] <Cfoo> eddiemonge: When I put ".getTime" after "start" and "end" it works fine but it passes the wrong format..
[18:46:44] <patbam> any opinions on which validation plugin to go with?
[18:47:04] <necromancer> jquery.validate
[18:47:16] <necromancer> (aka the jQuery form plugin, google it)
[18:47:26] <necromancer> it's nice. very customizable.
[18:49:14] <patbam> necromancer: thanks. there are tons of validation plugins, a bit overwhelming
[18:49:44] <necromancer> patbam: yeah i've noticed that...imo that's the only one you'll ever need, i haven't seen a reason to stop using it
[18:50:17] <patbam> necromancer: hmm, this one's nice in that it doesn't seem to require you to change you rmarkup at all
[18:51:18] <Cfoo> eddiemonge: fixed it! calEvent.start.toUTCString() works.
[18:51:22] <zw|home> Hows goes it?  I have a quick question, mainly just a point in the right direction maybe.. I want select, say, an icon, and then my mouse cursor to take icon's appearance.. with a div and background image.. Here's the problem I ran into, maybe i'm just n00b, but I unfortunately discovered that you can't click through a div.. or atleast by default... (sorry for general question) Any tips?
[18:51:43] <Cfoo> eddiemonge: thanks for your help and time
[19:00:56] <Loplin1> Hellos
[19:03:10] <patbam> necromancer:  actually this one looks pretty fly too: http://fredibach.ch/jquery-plugins/inputnotes.php
[19:05:18] <Loplin> Can anyone tell me if there is a way to make a slider range that grows from the center of the slider?   ie:  [-----#======:------------]
[19:05:20] <patbam> as long as we're talking recommendations, how about a minifier?
[19:05:29] <iszak> Everyone see the Angry Birds for Chrome?
[19:09:35] <patbam> which century are we in that it's ok for new stuff to be "best in browser x"?
[19:10:24] <Kre10s> patbam, the shitty century
[19:12:29] <coldhead> apropos of nothing, i think this post makes its points well http://astonj.com/tech/whats-so-special-about-ruby-on-rails/
[19:13:49] <devslash> hi is anyone here familiar with the jquery plugin jplayer ?
[19:13:52] <zw|home> does anyone know how to click through a div? is this possible?
[19:14:03] <patbam> "most Rails devs seem to use OS X and TextMate for example (even down to the same ‘theme’!) " /me just threw up a little in his mouth
[19:14:19] <ryanseddon> zw|home: you can use pointer-events: none; to enable click through in some browsers
[19:14:23] <coldhead> you are not the target audience, patbam
[19:14:39] <patbam> coldhead: thanks for letting me know
[19:14:52] <coldhead> my pleasure!
[19:15:02] <zw|home> ahh thanks a ton for pointer ryanseddon!  I was stumped hehe.
[19:20:28] <Z330> hey guys im new to jquery mobile. my issue im using the split example which works just fine out of the box, my issue is im doing a ajax call that loads the unordered list data from a php file and my data loads just fine but its no longer skinned with jquery mobile allmost like jquery can't apply the Skin to the html that is called by ajax is there a way i can call and tell jquery to reload the skin or something like this
[19:25:36] <Prot> siblings() question
[19:25:36] <Prot> http://jsfiddle.net/peRvp/
[19:26:07] <Prot> i can't get siblings() to work with an 'attribute exists' selector
[19:26:42] <devslash> has anyone here used jplayer  ?
[19:30:32] <Prot> same problem with filter()
[19:30:39] <Prot> my guess is filter() is used in siblings()
[19:30:54] <Prot> so theres some bug in filter() or i'm not understanding how the selector differes from find() and the rest
[19:31:36] <Prot> children() same prob
[19:33:06] <devslash> im trying to compare my jquery code that doesnt work with code that does work. could different version of jquery possible be the cause of the problem?
[19:33:24] <sarkis> ofcourse
[19:33:30] <Prot> better to trace/look at javascript errors
[19:33:31] <devslash> hmm
[19:33:36] <devslash> i have
[19:33:36] <Deeply> try the other version of jquery on the code that works ?
[19:33:37] <sarkis> devslash: no way to tell for sure though unless you share the code
[19:33:52] <devslash> hovav.org/myMusicStreamer is my site
[19:34:00] <sarkis> devslash: also, chceck for errors with either chrome or firefox/firebug
[19:34:05] <devslash> it works in Google Chrome/Safari but not firefox
[19:34:17] <devslash> so basically only webkit based browsers
[19:34:22] <sarkis> so check in firefox, see if there are errors
[19:34:32] <devslash> i did there arent any
[19:34:34] <sarkis> check your firebug console
[19:34:54] <sarkis> paste the code in question
[19:35:05] <devslash> theres too much to paste
[19:35:09] <andy8> Hey - I'm having trouble getting function closures to work the way I want... anyone have a sec to check out my code? thanks- http://snipt.org/xyY
[19:35:19] <devslash> please do view source for the site
[19:36:02] <andy8> its not jquery but i was hoping someone here could help :P
[19:36:29] <sarkis> devslash: page not found
[19:36:41] <devslash> http://hovav.org/MyMusicStreamer/
[19:36:52] <Prot> if anyone can tell me why this is happening, I'd appreciate it http://jsfiddle.net/peRvp/
[19:36:56] <devslash> oh sorry first m is supposed to be capital
[19:37:00] <gnarf> andy8: whats the problem?
[19:38:04] <andy8> gnarf: the comments at the top explain what the issue is - the onImageLoad function is called multiple times and somehow shares its value, reporting the last computed value back to all the callbacks even though they each are different
[19:38:46] <devslash> the code is different for chrome and firefox though
[19:39:18] * gnarf is confused
[19:39:38] <gnarf> andy8: what is ratios?
[19:39:48] <devslash> sarkis: are you looking at it ?
[19:39:54] <andy8> gnarg: its the image ratio, width /height
[19:40:07] <devslash> refresh it if you are
[19:40:09] <andy8> since im loading remote images, i cant compute them without loading them
[19:40:17] <tehOPEologist> hey all, i was wondering if someone could help me to write a small script that would add " onblur="if (this.value == '') {this.value = 'Your Name';}"  onfocus="if (this.value == 'Your Name') {this.value = '';}" " to an input tag on a page...  could anyone help me out?
[19:40:44] <gnarf> andy8: "ratios"
[19:40:46] <gnarf> undefined
[19:40:59] <gnarf> the thing you're looping through?
[19:41:24] <andy8> gnarf: oh sorry, thats an array of predefined ratios - im actually finding the closest ratio to the image out of that set.
[19:41:47] <gnarf> alright
[19:41:50] <gnarf> thanks
[19:41:56] <gnarf> i think your problem is at the bottom
[19:42:08] <gnarf> or rather the onImageLoad in general
[19:42:15] <gnarf> it should return a function
[19:42:24] <devslash> sarkis: are you there ?
[19:42:40] <gnarf> and i imagine that ratio calc should be in that function as well
[19:43:17] <iszak> coldhead, your article fails to mention that Rails doesn't come with jQuery by default but instead Prototype, ew.
[19:43:20] <gnarf> so make the whole body of function onImageLoad(img, cb) { return function() { //... your code }; }
[19:43:58] <gnarf> but i'd also suggest *cough* using jQuery
[19:44:13] <andy8> hmm, now that im looking at it again I *meant* to CALL the callback, not return it
[19:44:24] <andy8> but either way it was getting called and switching it doesn't fix it
[19:44:33] <andy8> I tried it with jquery first but it turned out worse haha
[19:44:51] <andy8> and am trying not to use jquery when the code is just as simple in plain js
[19:45:17] <devslash> can anyone help me debug my site in Firefox
[19:45:58] <Deeply> i have firefox, don't know how much i can help
[19:46:18] <devslash> i need helping debugging my jquery code in FF with Firebug
[19:46:18] <gnarf> andy8: http://jsfiddle.net/gnarf/CKERT/

[19:50:39] <andy8> alright, thanks
[19:51:23] <letterpress> devslash so what exactly DO you need help with?
[19:53:29] <devslash> letterpress: well when i want to pay a song using jplayer i do something like this: $("#jquery_jplayer_1").jPlayer("setMedia", { mp3: 'http://mysite.com/MyMusicStreamer/Music/' + file_path}).jPlayer("play");
[19:53:58] <devslash> this works fine in google chrome and safari but not Firefox. ive debugged it with no errors. it just doesnt play and i dont understand why
[19:54:10] <letterpress> is this online anywhere?
[19:55:44] <devslash> yea http://hovav.org/MyMusicStreamer/
[19:56:52] <miketaylr> devslash: i don't think FF has support for .mp3
[19:58:27] <miketaylr> unless jPlayer uses flash or something
[19:58:44] <devslash> no
[19:58:52] <devslash> really ?
[19:58:54] <miketaylr> yeah, http://html5doctor.com/native-audio-in-the-browser/
[19:59:00] <miketaylr> find the table
[19:59:03] <devslash> but it is in jplayer
[19:59:08] <miketaylr> Codec support in modern desktop browsers
[19:59:57] <devslash> I thought that the format depends on what jplayer supports
[20:00:33] <ryanseddon> You're missing the jplayer swf
[20:00:37] <devslash> no
[20:00:37] <ryanseddon> it's gets 404 on your site
[20:00:43] <devslash> i purposely left it out
[20:00:52] <devslash> because i want it to be entirely non flash based
[20:00:57] <ryanseddon> well thats why mp3 wont work in ff
[20:01:10] <ryanseddon> you need ogg or wav
[20:01:26] <devslash> if i add the swf then mp3 will work ?
[20:01:30] <ryanseddon> yeah
[20:01:36] <devslash> hmm ok ill try it out
[20:01:37] <devslash> thanks
[20:02:10] <djQuery> contains
[20:11:44] <sarkis> tehOPEologist: did you figure it out yet? :)
[20:11:46] <sarkis> http://jsfiddle.net/sdxPL/16/
[20:12:53] <sarkis> very easy to accomplish with jquery as you can see
[20:16:35] <sarkis> tehOPEologist: here is a way you can even change the css... http://jsfiddle.net/sdxPL/22/
[20:16:53] <sarkis> change the color of the input depending on if the user has entered anything yet

[21:19:13] <kosumo> i'm desperate, spent a month getting nowhere and project is due in 4 hours and i could do with a little help if anyone is free
[21:19:30] <kosumo> html5/css3/jQuery along with Google Maps API V3
[21:19:45] <coldhead> link?
[21:19:45] <ryanseddon> just ask the question
[21:20:11] <kosumo> its a number of things
[21:20:33] <kosumo> http://www.kosumonaut.com/seeni/
[21:21:24] <kosumo> want to add login, show contact on click of text, want users to be able to upload a photo and take exif data adding to maps
[21:22:40] <jovrtn> that's a tall order
[21:22:43] <jovrtn> for 4 hours
[21:23:16] <jovrtn> what do you have working so far?
[21:23:20] <jovrtn> out of those features
[21:23:48] <Edler> what are you talking about ? (just arrived here)
[21:23:58] <kosumo> sweet fa
[21:24:13] <kosumo> its ok
[21:24:22] <kosumo> i'll take what i deserve
[21:24:53] <coldhead> the exif can't happe in 4 hours
[21:24:59] <coldhead> for the contact see ?modal
[21:24:59] <bot-t> There are a number of excellent modal plugins for jQuery, including Colorbox (http://colorpowered.com/colorbox/) and jQuery UI Dialog (http://jqueryui.com/demos/dialog/). Want more? http://planetozh.com/projects/lightbox-clones/. Just don't use Thickbox, for your own sake! The BlockUI plugin (http://malsup.com/jquery/block/) can also be useful in providing modality.
[21:25:12] <coldhead> and login depends on the backebd
[21:25:46] <iszak> coldhead, no fancybox D:
[21:25:50] <ryanseddon> If browser support isn't a biggy you can get photo exif data in Chrome and Firefox client side http://demos.hacks.mozilla.org/openweb/FileAPI/
[21:26:23] <coldhead> you're awesome, ryanseddon
[21:27:57] <ryanseddon> :-D
[21:28:24] <ryanseddon> the real awesome person is Paul Rouget for doing the demo
[21:29:45] <Edler> wait
[21:29:46] <Edler> the exif data
[21:29:50] <Edler> is done client side ?
[21:29:52] <Edler> html5 ?
[21:30:10] <ryanseddon> yeah FIle API has access to file binary data
[21:30:18] <ryanseddon> but only in Chrome and FF so far
[21:30:26] <Edler> but the visitor must drop it in the browser of course
[21:30:31] <ryanseddon> yep
[21:30:31] <Edler> no way to read off the hard disk yourself
[21:30:36] <Edler> wow
[21:30:41] <Edler> but only new browsers support it
[21:30:42] <ryanseddon> No has to happen on a DnD drop event
[21:31:14] <Edler> aha
[21:31:16] <Edler> cool cool
[21:31:21] <ryanseddon> It's an offical spec so expect to see it in all browsers
[21:31:36] <ryanseddon> Opera has support but only through a file input
[21:31:49] <letterpress> that is awesome. the demo didn't work in chrome for me though.
[21:31:59] <Edler> neither did for me
[21:32:19] <ryanseddon> Chrome has an issue when you use DOM2 event listeners on a fileReader
[21:34:39] <ryanseddon> http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=48367
[21:39:32] <rosieres_> how could i prepend e.target.href with an absolte value ?? 'cause first link is relative . . . ab wanna make it absolute

[21:42:42] <webrole> hi.. i am adding onClick attribute to an element with jquery .. when i view the webpage in IE7, onclick funtion seems to be added, but nothing happends on click event.. any idea y?
[21:42:51] <webrole> IE8, firefox and chrome works fine
[21:45:28] <jovrtn> webrole: what code do you have firing inside the click callback?
[21:46:31] <webrole> jovrtn: i am trying to change src attribute for an image .. can i paste the code here? not much.. just 3 lines
[21:46:57] <jovrtn> you'll get spammed with warnings to use pastebin or jsfiddle
[21:47:03] <jovrtn> can you collapse it to a single line?
[21:47:44] <webrole> jovrtn: var src=$(ele).attr("src"); src=src.replace("product_full","product"); $('.imagecache-product').attr('src',src);
[21:48:46] <coldhead> tiny stones
[21:49:37] <webrole> jovrtn: actually i have removed all the code and tried with alert statement alone. but doesnot work
[21:50:15] <jovrtn> anything showing up in your JS error console?
[21:50:52] <webrole> jovrtn: not that i can see..
[21:51:07] <webrole> jovrtn: http://www.above1.info/portfolio/3/vardimigdal/bath-foam can you help me check this link
[21:52:13] <webrole> jovrtn: onclick is added for the bottom most images in the page.. with alert statement inside the function..
[21:52:36] <jovrtn> taking a look
[21:52:52] <webrole> jovrtn: thank you so much..
[21:53:44] <jovrtn> I suggest using the jquery click() event rather than attaching onClick as an attribute
[21:54:16] <jovrtn> $(this).click(function(event) {             }); instead of
[21:54:18] <jovrtn> $(this).attr("onClick","clickfunction(this)");
[21:54:37] <jovrtn> and put everything inside clickfunction inside of the click() callback
[21:57:02] <webrole> jovrtn: will try
[22:01:24] <webrole> jovrtn: its working.. thank you so much
[22:01:35] <webrole> breaking my head from yesterday on this
[22:01:42] <jovrtn> sure thing
[22:01:47] <webrole> thank you so much

[22:41:33] <Deeply> I'm using the paste site here, what does it mean when a line is red?
[22:41:59] <Edler> which paste site ?
[22:42:05] <Deeply> the jsfiddle one
[22:42:06] <Edler> alaing: what's the problem ?
[22:42:27] <alaing> when you click on the button it should log the cafe-submit value which it just returns "underfined"
[22:42:34] <alaing> undefined
[22:42:44] <Edler> Deeply...i don't know, any screenshot/link ?
[22:42:59] <Edler> alaing: when i click cancel nothing happens
[22:43:12] <Deeply>         if ($txt.indexOf("|") != -1) { //If the character | is found in the txt variable.
[22:43:15] <Deeply> that's the line.
[22:43:24] <Deeply> it starts at the 2nd (
[22:43:27] <Edler> screenshot it
[22:43:42] <alaing> Edler: have you looked in the console log?
[22:44:09] <Edler> ah checking
[22:44:18] <Edler> yeah
[22:44:20] <Edler> nothing appears
[22:44:24] <Edler> are you sure you can use $cancel ?
[22:44:28] <Edler> var $cancel
[22:44:32] <Edler> that's good js syntax ?
[22:45:00] <Edler> oh wait, you commented the console log
[22:45:27] <Deeply> trying to screenshot it
[22:45:31] <Edler> alaing: revise your code and giv eme the good jsfiddle link
[22:45:58] <Edler> while only keeping necessary code related to the problem
[22:51:11] <Deeply> i can't get it to screenshot

[22:51:16] <Deeply> that's what i have so far
[22:54:27] <alaing> Edler: ok this is the issue. When my custom attr ("cafe-submit") is defined inline with out using .attr then .attr('cafe-submit') returns the value (http://jsfiddle.net/Mycrj/3/). If I set the custom attribute using .attr() It returns undefined when I call .attr('cafe-submit') http://jsfiddle.net/Mycrj/4/

[23:16:04] <molavy> thanks,solved:-D
[23:16:36] <diegoviola> any ideas pls?
[23:17:48] <pachet> amirite: that's what ready() is for
[23:18:00] <amirite> pachet foo on you
[23:18:06] <amirite> you don't answer my question
[23:19:04] <diegoviola> i have a list of products on my web app, and i would like to add a selectable program count page size: 5, 10, 25, 50, etc. do i need ajax for that? should i send the value of the select element via ajax and return the data i need? any ideas please?
[23:19:07] <pachet> ok, sure, yes, bind to load
[23:19:33] <diegoviola> s/program/product/
[23:21:29] <pachet> diegoviola: that sounds fine
[23:23:08] <diegoviola> pachet: thanks
[23:28:31] <Deeply> 'k here goes nothing......
[23:28:51] <pachet> what you see a lot is a script will load elements into a dummy element, calculate the height of that, then animate the container to that size before appending those elements
[23:29:05] <pachet> maybe that would work in your case ;o

[23:35:51] <Deeply> doesn't seem to be working.
[23:36:41] <mykul|Home> wow Necrolyte
[23:36:53] <dukebag> hey, so i want an event that fires when an elements CSS attrib changes
[23:36:59] <dukebag> what's a good way to approach that?
[23:37:00] <mykul|Home> that's a name i haven't eard in awhile
[23:37:09] <domino14> i don't understand how these pop-ups work in jquery . there's an empty div at the bottom of the body tag, that gets expanded by css to full (position is at 0, 0, width height is 100%)
[23:37:21] <domino14> but then, if this div is taking up the whole screen, wouldn't it push all the other stuff out of the way?
[23:37:29] <Deeply> he's still around
[23:38:15] <molavy> i want create a confirm box that can use elsewhere like a function
[23:38:19] <dukebag> also, if i can get some further elaboration on a jquery plugin idiom... i'm using a function-style namespace (i.e. $(el).stw().MY_NAMESPACE_METHOD ...)
[23:38:19] <domino14> anyone know?
[23:38:34] <Deeply> I can post my non-jquery one that works
[23:38:35] <molavy> what is problem of this code :http://jsfiddle.net/mUpAm/
[23:38:36] <mykul|Home> dukebag, how is the attr changed?  I don't know about
[23:38:37] <dukebag> domino14 what the hell do you mean pop-up?  that's not jquery specific really
[23:38:46] <Deeply> i just want to know why the jquery one isn't working
[23:38:54] <dukebag> and what do you want to know
[23:38:59] <dukebag> absolute positioning or something, homie
[23:39:10] <pachet> domino14: its a fixed div, not empty at bottom of screen
[23:39:24] <dukebag> molavy, you want a non-browser alert box?
[23:39:40] <mykul|Home> k lemme look Deeply
[23:39:57] <dukebag> & someone answer my damn questions :)
[23:40:11] <molavy> yes
[23:40:26] <dukebag> molavy, sounds like you want a modal pop-up
[23:40:38] <dukebag> and then just whatever standard-ish kind of CSS/HTML stuff
[23:40:41] <ajpiano> dukebag: what is the question?
[23:40:42] <domino14> pachet: yes it is fixed, but why dont all the other divs go out of the way
[23:41:00] <mykul|Home> dukebag i dont know of a way to fo that
[23:41:09] <dukebag> ajpiano :) ... i was trying to get some further elaboration as to why doing $(el).stw().namespace_method was a poor approach
[23:41:16] <mykul|Home> but i think ajpiano would know better
[23:41:19] <dukebag> what are the potential pitfalls in specific, even
[23:41:32] <domino14> if i fill up the whole screen with one single div, i would expect just that div alone to show
[23:41:34] <ajpiano> dukebag: so the main pitfall is that it's really ambiguous
[23:41:48] <dukebag> so there is nothing technical, per se
[23:42:03] <ajpiano> well it raises techncial questions
[23:42:30] <ajpiano> so like, what does doing .foo() do? return you a jquery object so that you can chain, like a normal plugin?
[23:42:38] <ajpiano> or does it return the plugin instance, so you can call methods on it?
[23:42:43] <ajpiano> if it does the latter, then it can't do the former
[23:42:44] <dukebag> it stores the namespace instance
[23:42:54] <ajpiano> right but what does it *return*
[23:42:55] <dukebag> i was thinking of coding in a function that returns to the jquery namespace
[23:43:05] <ajpiano> dukebag: are you familar with jQuery.sub() ?
[23:43:07] <dukebag> it returns the 'stw' object
[23:43:10] <ajpiano> right
[23:43:13] <dukebag> no! :)  but i will be shortly
[23:43:29] <ajpiano> but that's contra to the jquery paradigm of methods being able to be chained along
[23:43:39] <ajpiano> dukebag: it's one way of accomplishing the pattern you're after
[23:43:57] <dukebag> that's good, that's the kind of stuff i'm after
[23:44:12] <dukebag> yea, it does chain, so-to-speak and all
[23:44:21] <ajpiano> well
[23:44:27] <ajpiano> it lets you chain method calls on the object
[23:44:34] <dukebag> it stores the jquery object internally, but the idea is that once you enter the 'stw' namespace, you only use stw methods
[23:44:36] <ajpiano> you're not on a jquery object anymore
[23:44:44] <ajpiano> yeah, then you should def look at sub
[23:44:45] <ajpiano> that's the idea
[23:44:50] <dukebag> hoorah :)
[23:45:10] <dukebag> oh oh oh and question #2, any plugins that give me an event when an element or selection CSS or style attribute changes?
[23:45:31] <ajpiano> don't know about that
[23:45:31] <dukebag> haha, or even just a 'hey go look at this method and code it yourself, ass' would do fine
[23:45:35] <ajpiano> sounds unperformant
[23:45:36] <ajpiano> :/
[23:46:06] <dukebag> it sounds like i want to hijack the current CSS function
[23:46:12] <dukebag> so that when it's called it fires the event
[23:46:21] <dukebag> i guess i can do that, yea?
[23:46:43] <ajpiano> oh well
[23:46:44] <dukebag> but that sounds like a 100% surefire bad coding practice, because you couldn't chain that with other code snippets/plugins/whatever
[23:46:45] <ajpiano> you can do that
[23:46:54] <ajpiano> duckpunching .css() is one thing
[23:47:03] <ajpiano> listening for whenever a css property changes for whatever reason
[23:47:09] <ajpiano> is a completely different story
[23:47:13] <dukebag> or perhpas not even haha... yea
[23:47:26] <dukebag> probably go with the first one
[23:47:31] <dukebag> i'm writing some 'overlays' plugin
[23:47:40] <ajpiano> the former is not entirely unreasonable, the second is a bit far fetched :
[23:47:41] <ajpiano> :p
[23:47:45] <dukebag> so you can easily create duplicates of elements that copy size and position
[23:47:49] <pachet> then when user clicks an img href or something hows that going...
[23:48:03] <dukebag> makes effects easier and nifty :)
[23:48:12] <ajpiano> hm
[23:48:13] <pachet> I'm having css kind of day
[23:48:17] <ajpiano> have you looked at the jquery rule plugin
[23:48:21] <dukebag> not at all!
[23:48:23] <ajpiano> ?g jQuery.rule
[23:48:25] <bot-t> ajpiano, Ariel Flesler: jQuery.Rule - http://flesler.blogspot.com/2007/11/jqueryrule.html
[23:48:33] <dukebag> someone better not have already coded this
[23:48:37] <dukebag> or i'll eat a pigeon
[23:48:39] <ajpiano> lets you dynamically write stylesheets and stuff
[23:48:53] <ajpiano> for more performant css stuff on lots of elements
[23:49:00] <ajpiano> i don't think it's exactly what you were writing but it might be relevant
[23:49:06] <dukebag> weird, so you can easily duplicate CSS changes?
[23:49:13] <ajpiano> i'd assume so
[23:49:20] <dukebag> shrimptesting
[23:49:29] <ajpiano> don't test on shrimp
[23:49:32] <ajpiano> they're too delcious
[23:49:37] <dukebag> shrimp have feelings too
[23:49:44] <dukebag> especially when they sing in unison
[23:50:02] <mykul|Home> ...
[23:50:04] <dukebag> (don't eaaat usss, we are the pinky shrimp that eaat the delicious on the bottom of the seaaaa floor)
[23:50:18] <dukebag> ok, that's all for now!
[23:50:20] <dukebag> cheerio mates!
[23:50:34] <ajpiano> gluck dukebag!
[23:51:55] <molavy> what is problem of this code :http://jsfiddle.net/mUpAm/
[23:52:38] <Deeply> heh
[23:52:41] <Deeply> still not working
[23:52:47] <ServerSage> molavy: Dunno, you tell us.
[23:52:53] <Deeply> lemme post up the regular javascript so you see what it's supposed to do
[23:55:20] <molavy> any idea?
[23:56:36] <molavy> no idea?
[23:56:36] <misterm> molavy: whats it supposed to do and whats it not doing?
[23:57:18] <Deeply> ok here's the original
[23:57:28] <Deeply> put aa|bb@ in the barcode field
[23:57:37] <Deeply> it should pop up an alert and fill in the other 2 textboxes
[23:59:26] <Lundy> heya guys anyone know wots up with this ?
[23:59:27] <Lundy> 			if ($('#product[' + $(this).attr('name') + ']').length > 0) {				alert("test");			}
[23:59:51] <misterm> Lundy: what about it?
