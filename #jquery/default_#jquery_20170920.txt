[02:21:11] <EugenA> it seems I have timing problem with this code https://pastebin.com/eVPhh5yY
[02:21:31] <EugenA> sometimes slider is not initialized (line 5)
[02:23:22] <EugenA> better pastebin: https://pastebin.com/UGm1MR0U
[02:24:14] <EugenA> slider html is in data, it is injected in page in line 12 and in line 14 there is slider initialization
[02:48:17] <undefined_bob> morning
[03:04:51] <Cork> EugenA: too little context
[03:42:26] <Neo1> hi
[03:42:35] <Neo1> I got error Uncaught ReferenceError: ui_dialog_interaction is not defined ?
[03:43:17] <Cork> Neo1: what file is referencing it?
[03:43:35] <Cork> cause it isn't a standard reference in jquery or jquery ui
[03:44:30] <Neo1> I used code from there to used work select 2 https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19787982/select2-plugin-and-jquery-ui-modal-dialogs
[03:44:41] <Neo1> to force*
[03:45:24] <Neo1> this line from that snippet http://prntscr.com/gnd4m3
[03:45:45] <Neo1> without that snippet select2 doesn't work on dialogs
[03:46:15] <Cork> not sure what ui_dialog_interaction is
[03:46:32] <Cork> it hasn't existed in jquery ui all the way back to 1.7.0
[03:46:38] <Cork> might be a select2 thing
[03:46:43] <Neo1> return ui_dialog_interaction.apply(this, arguments); this
[03:46:52] <Cork> ya, but that is the call
[03:46:52] <Neo1> this from jquery ui maybe
[03:47:05] <Cork> what is defineing ui_dialog_interaction
[03:47:17] <Neo1> don't know
[03:47:27] <Neo1> it's must be global variable somewhere
[03:47:31] <Cork> ya, me thither cause jquery ui doesn't
[03:47:38] <Cork> well a global function
[03:47:46] <Cork> but i don't know from where it isn't jquery or jquery ui
[03:48:00] <Neo1> seems like jquery UI
[03:48:21] <Neo1> without that row select2 doesn't work, but with I get error
[03:48:36] <Cork> ya, cause ui_dialog_interaction doesn't exist
[03:48:44] <Cork> you have to find what used to define it
[03:49:22] <Neo1> I can't maybe defined myself
[03:49:39] <Cork> sure if you know what the function did
[03:49:41] <Neo1> it must be a predefined variable with function
[03:49:49] <Neo1> I don't know
[03:50:14] <Cork> then defining it won't help you
[03:50:25] <Cork> you could just remove the line instead in that case
[03:51:27] <Neo1> I to try check, suddenly ui is include belong
[03:51:36] <Cork> ...
[03:51:44] <Cork> no, i have already checked jquery and jquery ui
[03:51:52] <Cork> and they have never included that function
[03:52:03] <Cork> and neither has select2
[03:52:24] <Cork> so ya you will have to find a site where you have used it and check for where it comes from
[03:53:12] <Cork> (checked select2 4.x to 1.0 so it wasn't it, and checked jquery-ui 1.12 to 1.7 so it wasn't that either)
[03:53:35] <Neo1> Cork: see http://prntscr.com/gnd7x7
[03:53:53] <Neo1> Cork: you think need to use 1.7?
[03:54:07] <Cork> read the comment again
[03:55:36] <Cork> "Search finished. No matches found"
[03:56:07] <Neo1> what?
[03:56:41] <Neo1> I use select2 4.0.3 and jquery UI 1.12.1
[03:56:46] <Neo1> Cork: what to do?
[03:56:55] <Cork> sure, but those aren't defining that function
[03:56:59] <Cork> you have to find what is
[03:57:33] <Neo1> you think use later version?
[03:57:37] <Neo1> old
[03:57:38] <Cork> ah, not i see i missed a line in so
[03:57:45] <Cork> var ui_dialog_interaction = $.ui.dialog.prototype._allowInteraction; <--
[03:57:57] <Cork> and the previous post _allowInteraction: function (event) { <--
[03:58:10] <Cork> not sure that is supported though
[03:58:35] <Cork> it is setting random options in the dialogs option storage, if it starts limiting those values this will fail
[03:59:00] <Cork> "not i see" == "now i see"
[03:59:59] <Neo1> bad understand
[04:00:16] <Cork> i would prob recommend to just move the one liner from the _allowInteraction function into the place where you call it in the second post
[04:00:17] <Neo1> that variable exists? And what to do?
[04:00:23] <Cork> none of them
[04:00:33] <Cork> those are custom modifications of the dialog
[04:00:42] <Cork> and none of them has anything to do with the dialog actually
[04:01:10] <Neo1> and how prevent error?
[04:01:24] <Cork> you would have to do the code modification they are doing
[04:01:39] <Cork> not just half of it (and possibly modify it so it gets compatible with newer version of jquery)
[04:02:16] <Neo1> ok nothing understand
[04:02:44] <Neo1> Cork: better maybe include old version jquery and all will work?
[04:03:01] <Cork> only if you do the same code modification
[04:03:13] <Cork> like i said none of this is standard, or supported by jquery ui
[04:05:11] <Neo1> what you said I did not understood
[04:05:31] <Cork> ok, "don't copy paste code from so you don't understand"
[04:05:43] <Cork> cause when the hacks break you will have to fix them
[04:06:26] <Neo1> maybe exists new hacks?
[04:06:34] <Cork> you can look
[04:06:47] <Cork> but that code has always been a really bad idea
[04:07:57] <Neo1> Cork: see https://github.com/select2/select2/issues/1246
[04:10:00] <Neo1> Cork: that is old and there many read, do you know some other plugins which copy select2 functionality, I want to try theme
[04:10:21] <Neo1> Cork: I need select simply with search line
[04:10:43] <Neo1> Cork: I use select2 only because there present live search...
[04:11:04] <Cork> Neo1: can you make a jsfiddle showing exactly how select2 breaks dialog?
[04:11:28] <Uhkis> move on to chosen and everything is fine and dandy
[04:11:33] <Neo1> I can give you access to that page, it's place on my test server wait I look
[04:11:41] <Cork> ...
[04:11:56] <Cork> Neo1: no, it is not a privilege to help you, you will have to do the legwork
[04:13:58] <Neo1> Cork: go there, here my test code, http://test2.kselax.ru login subscriber and pass subscriber
[04:14:56] <Neo1> Cork: then go to this page http://test2.kselax.ru/calculator-diet/?menu=diary and press this link http://prntscr.com/gndgni
[04:15:03] <Neo1> Cork: or use translator
[04:15:47] <Neo1> jqueryUI has maybe select2 functionality?
[04:16:03] <Neo1> need to look, I saw there exists live search
[04:16:32] <Neo1> maybe select2 not suited for dialog
[04:18:25] <Neo1> I found this http://prntscr.com/gndi5b
[04:18:35] <Neo1> autocomplete
[04:18:52] <Neo1> I used to use select2, but should delete him
[04:20:36] <Neo1> I'm very disappointed :(
[04:49:32] <Neo1> jquery UI has combobox, it's even better than select2 )
[05:17:22] <Neo1> hmm
[05:18:11] <Neo1> there a hard way create select, I got error combobox is not a function
[05:18:23] <Neo1> I see impossible easy use jQuery UI
[05:19:01] <hellyeah> do you have fiddle?
[05:19:19] <hellyeah> did you include jquery ui lib?
[05:44:20] <gsilvavera> hi all, i'm having some trouble using different versions of jquery UI, can anyone tell me if there is a way to replace the ui version associated to jquery on the fly?
[05:45:17] <Cork> gsilvavera: you should only use one version of jquery ui at a time (same is strongly recommended for jquery too)
[05:50:19] <Neo1> what means this syntax $(function(){}); ?
[05:50:23] <Neo1> it's like ready?
[05:50:48] <gsilvavera> I know that <Cork> but unfortunately I can't is there any way to replace it on the fly?
[05:51:25] <Cork> you could locate functions in $.fn and $.ui.fn that has changed and "patch" them i guess
[05:51:31] <Cork> but no that is a really bad idea
[05:52:08] <Neo1> Cork: that function located there?
[05:52:10] <Neo1> in this$
[05:52:15] <Neo1> Cork: its like ready?
[05:52:45] <Neo1> Cork: do you know how to use combobox? In jQuery UI this function is absence
[05:52:47] <Cork> Neo1: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery/
[05:54:17] <Neo1> Cork: we passed function there $(function(){}) Why?
[05:55:44] <Neo1> maybe for execute
[05:56:24] <Neo1> Cork: this equal this function(){}() ???
[05:56:47] <Neo1> oh or no function({});
[05:56:54] <Neo1> or I forgot
[06:01:27] <Woet> Neo1: why dont you read the docs?
[06:33:02] <gsilvavera> thanks for your help <Cork>
[07:12:48] <Neo1> Woet: there much read, I don't like reading
[07:12:59] <Woet> Neo1: then hire someone
[07:13:11] <Neo1> Woet: do you know how to create jQuery framework?
[07:13:20] <Neo1> Woet: I add that to my function https://hastebin.com/pejicaluci.js
[07:13:33] <Neo1> Woet: see that code, if did I do correct?
[07:13:35] <Woet> Neo1: my hourly is $150, i think you need to find someone else
[07:14:20] <Neo1> Woet: 150 it's much, my only 10$ and not somebody who would hire me :(
[07:14:31] <Woet> Neo1: time to start reading those docs then
[07:14:48] <Neo1> Woet: I don't need that docs, there exists example
[07:14:53] <Woet> Neo1: good luck.
[07:14:55] <Neo1> Woet: I tried used it and all work
[07:15:13] <Neo1> Woet: I don't know how to create jQuery framework
[07:15:44] <Neo1> Woet: how I can add my own function and call it $().my_own_function(); ???
[07:16:00] <Woet> Neo1: the documentation tells you
[07:16:02] <Neo1> Woet: I use this, my_combobox('selector');
[07:16:19] <Neo1> Woet: it's long read
[07:16:29] <Woet> Neo1: better get started then
[07:17:34] <Neo1> Woet: what you doing, how you call?  How need? I know only this my_combobox('selector'); . But I see in plugins use this $('selector').my_combobox(); . Do you know how to do this?
[07:17:45] <Woet> Neo1: the documentation tells you
[07:17:49] <Neo1> Woet: or it's not worth do? I don't have time, have much work
[07:17:56] <Woet> Neo1: better get started then
[07:18:04] <Neo1> Woet: dont have time for reading
[07:18:09] <Woet> Neo1: then hire someone
[07:18:28] <Neo1> Woet: don't have money, you are very expensive
[07:18:32] <Woet> Neo1: time to start reading those docs then
[07:18:49] <Neo1> Woet: ok, maybe  you convinced me
[07:18:52] <Woet> Neo1: good luck.
[07:19:13] <Neo1> I think reading it's very slow method for learning....
[07:19:19] <Woet> Neo1: better get started then
[07:20:01] <Neo1> what you mean when saying 'better get started then'?
[07:20:11] <Neo1> Woet: get start read?
[07:20:28] <Neo1> I don't understand meaning
[07:20:59] <Neo1> Woet: I difficult read, I have bad English....
[07:22:13] <Neo1> ok, will read, I see nobody can help
[08:36:09] <Neo1> I created repository on githab https://github.com/kselax/kselax-framework/blob/master/kselax.css
[08:36:51] <Neo1> it will jQuery, css, php framework
[08:36:52] <Neo1> https://github.com/kselax/kselax-framework
[08:37:36] <Neo1> who can give advise which function add there?
[08:41:15] <undefined_bob> == Neo1 was kicked from #css by preaction [Your behavior is not conducive to the desired environment.]
[08:41:16] <undefined_bob> maybe you wont get much help her
[08:41:56] <Woet> yea he's extremely dense
[08:42:05] <Woet> and refuses to read documentation
[08:43:26] <Neo1> undefined_bob: what her?
[08:43:37] <Neo1> undefined_bob: preaction is she?
[08:43:59] <Neo1> Woet: I started create my framework
[08:45:33] <Neo2> undefined_bob: he not kicked me, he banned, I can't go there now :(
[08:46:20] <Neo2> he did not kick me, he banned.
[08:47:17] <undefined_bob> did you ask your self why?
[08:58:15] <Neo1> undefined_bob: I answered for nothing
[08:58:31] <Neo1> undefined_bob: should not speak with admins in rooms
[08:59:42] <poboy> wtf, I just get here and people are getting banned?
[09:01:06] <undefined_bob> poboy: that was in an other channel
[09:01:15] <Neo1> in css
[09:01:25] <Neo1> I spoke with admin and got ban for nothing
[09:31:49] <Dee_> hey team need some help on the follow error when i use $('.accessorize-it-sidepanel').toggle("slide", {direction:'right'}); https://imgur.com/Zoy5V0o
[09:32:49] <Dee_> I won't be able to update the jquery library 'jquery-1.7.1.min.js' FYI
[09:46:46] <diony> hey team need some help on the follow error when i use $('.accessorize-it-sidepanel').toggle("slide", {direction:'right'}); https://imgur.com/Zoy5V0o
[09:49:05] <fn> diony: check syntax
[09:49:06] <Woet> diony: why can't you update something thats 6 years old and EOL?
[09:49:21] <fn> .toggle( [duration ] [, complete ] )
[09:49:31] <Woet> diony: and has security vulnerabilities?
[09:50:06] <fn> Woet: ?
[09:50:11] <Woet> fn: ?
[09:51:11] <fn> how do you know the EOL/6y old based on this code?
[09:51:35] <Uhkis> because he told the jquery version
[09:51:46] <Woet> [15:32:47]  <Dee_>	I won't be able to update the jquery library 'jquery-1.7.1.min.js' FYI
[09:51:54] <Woet> its also mentioned in the error message.
[09:54:02] <poboy> so data attributes are for storing info other than basic attributes like id and name?
[09:54:37] <Woet> poboy: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Howto/Use_data_attributes
[09:55:21] <poboy> yeah, that was the only thing I found about it
[09:55:51] <diony> is there an alternative to "$('.accessorize-it-sidepanel').toggle("slide", {direction:'right'});" ??
[09:57:07] <diony> Woet: yeah code base is old and trying to avoid injecting latest library cause it may break older stuff
[09:58:08] <Woet> diony: so you'd rather have security vulnerabilities?
[09:59:14] <poboy> ok, I get it.  I can set data attributes to something then use js later to change said attributes
[10:11:26] <diony> Woet: not at all, will bring it up to the client
[11:16:26] <poboy> we're building this dropdown list in jquery and I'm not quite sure how to start this with option value = 0 and have that blank.  https://kopy.io/v5XXl
[11:18:39] <taplar> add the blank one to the array prior to the loop
[11:19:26] <poboy> ah dang.  I was adding it in the for loop.  :)
[11:21:59] <poboy> still not loading though.  https://kopy.io/XkswV
[11:25:36] <adavia> Is this a library issue maybe? Switching between tabs here is not working as expected https://jsfiddle.net/vscotLab/1/
[11:29:01] <taplar> poboy: load the array, not the string...
[11:30:47] <poboy> not sure how
[11:31:43] <taplar> just push the string to your array
[11:31:50] <taplar> outside the loop
[11:32:30] <taplar> line 10
[11:34:32] <adavia> ?
[11:35:30] <taplar> selectList.append(optionText)
[11:39:02] <poboy> can't believe I'm still struggling with this.  https://kopy.io/2rMsx
[11:40:07] <taplar> dude, no
[11:40:11] <taplar> think it through
[11:40:17] <taplar> you have a loop
[11:40:24] <taplar> you are creating a string containing an option
[11:40:36] <taplar> you are then appending that to another string that is aggregating all the options
[11:40:57] <taplar> if you want it to have a single default, blank, option at the start of that aggregate string .....
[11:41:27] <poboy> It should start before the loop
[11:41:59] <grapheti> also may need to escape your quotes on line 8
[11:42:21] <taplar> line 8 will just be appending the optionText
[11:42:36] <grapheti> ah, nvm then
[11:43:33] <poboy> surprised I haven't been fired for incompetence yet.
[11:43:47] <adavia> haha
[11:43:48] <taplar> figure it out?
[11:44:05] <poboy> not yet
[11:44:57] <taplar> what's the starting value of 'selectList'?
[11:45:51] <grapheti> poboy, you just have to walk it through and understand it, we've all been here
[11:47:48] <poboy> selectList is on line 7.  https://kopy.io/IM5fw
[11:48:22] <taplar> ok, should that select always start with an empty option?
[11:48:55] <poboy> idk about always but for now it should
[11:49:05] <taplar> so what could you do to line 7 to make that happen?
[11:50:30] <poboy> I tried adding my option tag but that did not work
[11:50:39] <taplar> at the end of it?
[11:51:19] <taplar> <select ..... />  <-- what does that / do?
[11:51:49] <poboy> that is <select blah></select>
[11:52:05] <taplar> there's not a </select> there though
[11:52:06] <poboy> so I need to put the option in between there
[11:52:25] <taplar> "/>" is a self closing tag
[11:53:42] <poboy> yeah, so I tried closing it then adding option value="0" then do the </select>
[11:54:00] <taplar> double closing?
[11:54:34] <taplar> you can't double close something
[11:55:46] <poboy> https://kopy.io/yQEmR
[11:56:11] <taplar> how do you concatenate strings?
[11:56:33] <poboy> ' + '
[11:56:45] <taplar> so look at your kopy.io
[11:57:28] <taplar> though I don't know why you wouldn't just stick this all in a single string, but if you are going to concatenate, the syntax you have in that pastie is wrong
[12:00:27] <poboy> got it taplar.  thanks.
[12:00:37] <poboy> apologies for coming across like the dumbest person on the planet
[12:04:50] <poboy> and this was the easy part of what I need to do today/tomorrow.  :)
[12:05:58] <taplar> glad you got it
[12:06:43] <poboy> if I'm still employed a couple months from now, remind me and I'll paypal you $ for a beer
[12:06:52] <taplar> it's all good
[12:07:14] <taplar> sorry if i came across a little snappy in places.  i think today is going to be one of 'those days', :)
[12:07:49] <poboy> not at all.  I appreciate your help.  some of this stuff I know but I get overwhelmed it seems
[13:36:53] <StrangeCompany> I'm having issues with receiving responses from the server and processing them within AJAX. Sometimes, requests work successfully. Intermittently, server responses are displayed as text on a raw HTML page, no matter their format, JSON or otherwise.
[13:36:57] <StrangeCompany> Any ideas as to why that might be happening?
[13:37:18] <robertmaxrees> can you show the code?
[13:37:19] <StrangeCompany> Using jQuery for the front and Python for the back
[13:37:24] <StrangeCompany> Sure, just a sec
[13:37:35] <StrangeCompany> I'll paste in the function on either side
[13:38:48] <StrangeCompany> http://jsbin.com/zavatedora/edit?html,js,output
[13:39:05] <StrangeCompany> The middle panel
[13:39:14] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[13:39:27] <robertmaxrees> okay so.
[13:39:41] <robertmaxrees> location.reload();
[13:39:52] <robertmaxrees> you're using ajax to submit the form and then you're reloading the page anyway?
[13:40:33] <StrangeCompany> Yes. And it works for all intents and purposes, aside from the issue with server responses being displayed on an HTML page.
[13:40:39] <StrangeCompany> Unless you think those issues are interrelated?
[13:41:20] <robertmaxrees> Well.
[13:41:41] <robertmaxrees> what you're doing here is basically what the browser does without using ajax.
[13:42:27] <StrangeCompany> So you're saying that I shouldn't even need that AJAX function and that I could get the form data over with just native form HTML functionality?
[13:42:48] <robertmaxrees> well.
[13:42:50] <robertmaxrees> that depends heh.
[13:42:59] <StrangeCompany> Sure. Sorry, was just trying to clarify.
[13:43:08] <robertmaxrees> normally you'd setup your server to send the user back to a particular page.
[13:43:10] <robertmaxrees> instead of trying to reload.
[13:43:16] <StrangeCompany> Right.
[13:43:31] <robertmaxrees> also: is this in an event handler of some kind?
[13:43:48] <StrangeCompany> I figured that I could send a basic text response back client-side, though, and tell the client to refresh to browser window without returning a separate page.
[13:43:55] <StrangeCompany> Is that too forceful of a bypass?
[13:44:21] <robertmaxrees> why refresh the window?
[13:44:22] <StrangeCompany> Um, I'm not sure sure what you mean by event handler, specifically. The AJAX is the function that runs when a form is submitted.
[13:44:33] <StrangeCompany> So I guess the submission would be the event.
[13:44:46] <robertmaxrees> the code that calls the ajax submission on post is called an event handler :)
[13:44:51] <robertmaxrees> what does that look like?
[13:44:54] <StrangeCompany> To retrieve the data that was just added to the database automatically. An automatic update to the list.
[13:45:40] <robertmaxrees> yeah, so if you wanna do that, you want to update the page without reloading it.
[13:45:49] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, skip this and just have the server direct you back to the page.
[13:47:20] <StrangeCompany> Just a second. I'll try that.
[13:50:00] <StrangeCompany> @robertmaxrees Man, I'm not sure why I didn't think of that. Much simpler than sending a response just for a JS server refresh. It's brought up another problem. I think I had this same issue with another web-based CRUD app I was working.
[13:50:15] <StrangeCompany> It's submitting the form data twice now, with the redirect I added.
[13:50:29] <StrangeCompany> Er, processing it twice at least.
[13:52:03] <StrangeCompany> I think that might have been why I started going for a window refresh in the first place.
[13:56:08] <robertmaxrees> sorry, back now.
[13:56:22] <robertmaxrees> well.
[13:56:30] <robertmaxrees> do you still have the event handler running the ajax?
[13:57:17] <randymarsh9> hey guys
[13:57:43] <randymarsh9> does anyone know why my ajax call defaults to the error: function?
[13:57:49] <randymarsh9> https://jsfiddle.net/jrabyve7/
[13:58:01] <robertmaxrees> randymarsh9 what's the response?
[13:58:31] <StrangeCompany> robertmaxrees Yeah, I got rid of the event handler and it's only processing it one time. Looks like native form submission is the way to go. I was throwing jQuery at things I didn't need to.
[13:58:32] <robertmaxrees> try killing the dataType and see if that works.
[13:58:35] <robertmaxrees> randymarsh9 ^
[13:58:35] <StrangeCompany> Thanks a ton, robert.
[13:58:47] <robertmaxrees> StrangeCompany definitely!  good luck :)
[13:58:51] <randymarsh9> robertmaxrees: if i remove dataType then it works
[13:59:20] <robertmaxrees> randymarsh9 yeah - dataType is the type of response you're expecting from the server.
[13:59:30] <randymarsh9> but i can't get the json to show up properly on my backend so i thought i need it
[13:59:40] <randymarsh9> oh
[14:00:28] <robertmaxrees> :)
[14:02:17] <randymarsh9> so if i remove it then it tells me success but i can't get it to show
[14:02:23] <randymarsh9> maybe i should be using $.post() instead?
[14:02:39] <robertmaxrees> randymarsh9 nope.  you're basically doing a post now.
[14:02:46] <robertmaxrees> "can't get it to show" where?
[14:02:49] <randymarsh9> but i tried with postman and it works
[14:02:59] <randymarsh9> which makes me think it's a problem with the method i'm using
[14:03:22] <robertmaxrees> what's the code you're actually using then?
[14:03:32] <randymarsh9> that's it right there
[14:03:44] <robertmaxrees> you're not passing any data to the success handler.
[14:03:54] <robertmaxrees> you're just logging out that it succeeded
[14:04:04] <randymarsh9> are you kidding me..
[14:04:16] <robertmaxrees> err, you'
[14:04:17] <StrangeCompany> Hahahaha
[14:04:25] <robertmaxrees> *you ARE passing it, but you're not doing anything with it.
[14:04:26] <StrangeCompany> randy >3
[14:04:28] <StrangeCompany> <3
[14:04:48] <robertmaxrees> randymarsh9 https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/jrabyve7/1/
[14:05:20] <randymarsh9> oh i see what you're saying
[14:05:32] <randymarsh9> so for now i'm just trying to have the data show up in my backend (node server)
[14:05:50] <randymarsh9> once that works i'll add stuff to the success: function
[14:05:58] <robertmaxrees> ah that's what you're talking about.
[14:06:10] <randymarsh9> yea
[14:06:11] <robertmaxrees> are you looking at the right place for the request body?
[14:06:45] <randymarsh9> yes, i'm logging it to my node console and it just prints an empty set like this {}
[14:07:01] <robertmaxrees> what happens if you ditch the ajax and just submit normally?
[14:07:20] <randymarsh9> but i know my backend code is okay because when i test sending with another program (postman) it logs the full object
[14:07:32] <randymarsh9> hm haven't tried yet
[14:07:46] <robertmaxrees> fwiw the request body is differently formatted between an ajax post and a form post iirc.
[14:09:39] <randymarsh9> if i wanted to submit normally how would that look?
[14:09:47] <robertmaxrees> it'd just be a form.
[14:12:14] <StrangeCompany> robert, I have a quick question you might be able to help me out with
[14:12:20] <robertmaxrees> sup?
[14:12:53] <StrangeCompany> Let's say I'm doing native form submission, but I have a case where the server wants to return "FALSE" on a check. There's no AJAX handler to catch this response, so how would I go about catching it client-side?
[14:13:04] <chasepeeler> robertmaxrees:  thanks for the help with the promises stuff the other day. Worked great. I have another variation on the problem... and before I do it a complicated way, I want to make sure there isn't an easier way.
[14:13:35] <robertmaxrees> StrangeCompany you don't.  your server should look at what the response would be and you should direct the user accordingly.
[14:13:41] <robertmaxrees> chasepeeler sup?
[14:15:09] <chasepeeler> I have a list of elements (let's say there are 100 of them)... every time one of them is clicked, I need to load some data. I don't want to preload the data, because chances are only a few will be clicked. If possible though, I don't want to make a second ajax call for the same item
[14:15:42] <robertmaxrees> chasepeeler what do you have so far?
[14:16:59] <chasepeeler> I haven't done anything yet. I can do it where it makes the ajax call every time the element is clicked without issue......... I guess I could create a deferred for each element, and then call the proper deferred based on the clicked element
[14:17:39] <robertmaxrees> chasepeeler that's basically what I'd do.  maybe make an array of deferreds or something.
[14:17:53] <chasepeeler> yea, and map them by id, because each element has a unique id
[14:17:54] <robertmaxrees> coupla ways to handle taht.
[14:18:32] <chasepeeler> I could actually wait and create the deferred until it's clicked... if there isn't a deferred, then create it and add it to the map
[14:18:48] <taplar> you could put the deferred on the element with data()
[14:19:21] <chasepeeler> true
[14:19:31] <robertmaxrees> that could work, though at that point you're getting into model-view territory
[14:20:03] <taplar> it's in the jQuery cache though
[14:20:29] <taplar> *shrug*
[14:20:45] <chasepeeler> yea, not really much of a difference, at least with the way I have things built, besides a global variable to act as the cache, and storing it on the element itself......
[14:23:13] <chasepeeler> actually, the list represents items that the app is used to create or update. In the case of an update, I remove the element, then just add it back (it's easier that updating attributes of the element itself, because I can pass the json from the call directly to my template)... so, it might be better to have the map, that way I don't recreate the deferred after a field is updated (ids won't change)
[14:24:01] <robertmaxrees> plus it separates your data from your view a little more cleanly imo
[14:30:57] <chasepeeler> eh, the way I see it.... I can only access that data in my JS code... I have no way to define or access it via dom attributes... so, it's still separated in my opinion, even using .data()
[14:31:25] <robertmaxrees> except that removing an element and adding in a new one breaks the relationship.
[14:31:36] <robertmaxrees> which ties the DOM and your data together.
[14:31:46] <robertmaxrees> which is a good thing to avoid imo.
[14:33:49] <chasepeeler> agreed. I mean, in this case, it's not a huge deal. It just means if the element is clicked, it makes an ajax call to get data that it USED to have... but, I'm always a proponent of doing things the right way when it doesn't matter... because then it's easier to do it the right way when it does matter
[14:34:20] <randymarsh9> hey robertmaxrees, so on my node backend if i include "app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({extended: true}))" then my node console logs the data from my jquery code
[14:34:37] <randymarsh9> if i only include "app.use(bodyParser.json())" it just prints an empty set {}
[14:35:38] <robertmaxrees> there you go then.
[14:37:01] <randymarsh9> someone told me not to use urlencoded though, it's strange the jquery only shows up if i include it
[14:37:14] <robertmaxrees> you mean the data?
[14:37:18] <randymarsh9> yes
[14:37:41] <randymarsh9> i'm trying to print the data in my node console
[14:37:51] <robertmaxrees> https://medium.com/@yaniv_g/dont-use-bodyparser-json-with-jquery-post-d034c44ac7ad
[14:37:55] <robertmaxrees> this explains why btw.
[14:38:09] <robertmaxrees> also: fwiw, "the jquery" is just a library.  it's not the data itself :)
[14:38:37] <randymarsh9> robertmaxrees: that's exactly it!! you're a genius
[14:38:56] <robertmaxrees> nah.
[14:39:00] <robertmaxrees> i've just seen things.
[14:39:32] <randymarsh9> here i thought i was the only person on earth
[14:39:40] <randymarsh9> with all the empty sets..
[14:42:19] <randymarsh9> robertmaxrees: is it bad to use urlencoded?
[14:43:16] <SpecialTech> has anybody used chosen.js yet?
[14:43:43] <robertmaxrees> SpecialTech looks like quite a few people.
[14:43:50] <robertmaxrees> randymarsh9 i'd let #Node.js tackel that one.
[14:44:26] <randymarsh9> well
[14:44:49] <randymarsh9> i think the reason the dataType: json wasn't working was because i was never sending anything back from the server
[14:44:52] <chasepeeler> robertmaxrees: this look right? https://bpaste.net/show/1b6dd07108bc
[14:45:02] <randymarsh9> so if i send something back i think it might work
[14:45:41] <SpecialTech> is there a way to add to a value of a option without having to edit the options themselves?
[14:47:34] <robertmaxrees> randymarsh9 i'd still leave dataType off fwiw.
[14:47:40] <robertmaxrees> randymarsh9 since that has nothing to do with your issue.
[14:48:38] <robertmaxrees> chasepeeler that's one way.  tho you can shorted if('undefined' == typeof(map[id])){ to just if (!map[id]) {
[14:48:51] <robertmaxrees> *shortened
[14:49:36] <chasepeeler> old habits..... I guess it was a really old version of IE that didn't always play nice with that shorthand
[14:49:51] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[14:50:00] <chasepeeler> or, I just imagined it at some point, and started doing it for no reason
[14:50:22] <robertmaxrees> old IE treats undefined as falsy.
[14:50:32] <randymarsh9> robertmaxrees: it does
[14:51:07] <robertmaxrees> also: why are you making a new deferred when $.post returns one already?
[14:51:13] <robertmaxrees> map[id] = $.post(\
[14:51:20] <randymarsh9> the article says the default datatype for $.ajax() method urlencoded
[14:51:35] <chasepeeler> wait, it's a habit from instances where I'm not guaranteed that the object itself will be defined
[14:51:50] <StrangeCompany> robertmaxrees I'm at an impasse. I need to send an additional piece of data that isn't in one of the forms in order to process a change correctly. It seems like trying to submit a native form and a piece of AJAX data simultaneously is making it have a fit. Do I need a new approach or is there a way I could do it?
[14:51:58] <randymarsh9> method is urlencoded*, so if i want to use json in my node backend i also need to send it as json datatype
[14:52:01] <robertmaxrees> randymarsh9 my point was more that you don't need datatype since jquery will iunfer it for you.
[14:52:04] <chasepeeler> robertmaxrees: ah, okay... was a bit confused in that area... but that makes sense
[14:52:31] <robertmaxrees> StrangeCompany sorry, can you show some code so I can better understand what you're trying to do?
[14:52:40] <StrangeCompany> sure
[14:52:49] <chasepeeler> I was basically duplicating an example you gave me last time, where I called resolve() on the deferred inside the ajax callback
[14:53:06] <robertmaxrees> chasepeeler i barely remember what that was now hahaha
[14:53:40] <randymarsh9> robertmaxrees: oh didn't realize it infers things. still with it not working i feel i should specify just to see
[14:53:50] <robertmaxrees> randymarsh9 it won't fix anything.
[14:53:52] <robertmaxrees> heh
[14:54:03] <robertmaxrees> at least i'd be very surprised.
[14:54:09] <robertmaxrees> if that DOES fix it, it means your headers are back.
[14:54:10] <randymarsh9> can we try
[14:54:26] <randymarsh9> i want to see lol
[14:54:33] <robertmaxrees> (shrug)
[14:54:39] <robertmaxrees> don't need to ask permission.
[14:54:44] <robertmaxrees> if that fixes it then you need to correct your headers.
[14:54:52] <chasepeeler> robertmaxrees: https://bpaste.net/show/3f3d7cff72b1
[14:55:28] <StrangeCompany> robertmaxrees http://jsbin.com/wagipopeni/edit?html,js,output
[14:55:36] <robertmaxrees> chasepeeler gotta question?
[14:55:50] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[14:55:53] <chasepeeler> no, that was what I was referencing that you said you couldn't remember
[14:55:55] <robertmaxrees> StrangeCompany why do you need the ajax call?
[14:55:57] <StrangeCompany> Basically, the /changename route server-side needs the ID that's provided by the AJAX POST, but I also want to submit the first name and last name via native form data.
[14:56:09] <robertmaxrees> StrangeCompany why does it need it via ajax??
[14:56:34] <StrangeCompany> Because the ID isn't something that would be user provided, its all handled in the background of the client
[14:56:42] <robertmaxrees> StrangeCompany erm.
[14:56:45] <StrangeCompany> ID isn't part of the HTML form
[14:56:50] <robertmaxrees> heh
[14:56:58] <robertmaxrees> you add a hidden form field and populate it with that ID.
[14:57:12] <StrangeCompany> You can do that???
[14:57:15] <StrangeCompany> Wow, I didn't know
[14:57:25] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/hidden
[14:57:42] <robertmaxrees> just set the value="theIdHere"
[14:57:57] <StrangeCompany> So I'd have to get that JS value into the HTML somehow?
[14:58:14] <randymarsh9> robertmaxrees: specifying dataType: "json", in my jquery works if i send data back from my backend!!
[14:58:27] <robertmaxrees> StrangeCompany yep.  you're already making it available via js it looks like.
[14:58:39] <robertmaxrees> randymarsh9 then your headers from your server are bad.
[14:58:43] <chasepeeler> https://bpaste.net/show/8aebc544a2b5 better?
[14:59:07] <robertmaxrees> aside from my gripes about your whitespace, yeah :P
[14:59:14] <randymarsh9> robertmaxrees: you're right though the node console still doesn't log it
[14:59:34] <randymarsh9> oh well as long as i can send data back and forth i don't really care
[14:59:45] <chasepeeler> robertmaxrees: thanks!
[14:59:48] <randymarsh9> robertmaxrees: working now thanks to you. thank you!!
[14:59:53] <robertmaxrees> randymarsh9 erm.
[14:59:57] <robertmaxrees> you should care.
[15:00:02] <robertmaxrees> that's asking for bugs down the road.
[15:02:24] <randymarsh9> now that you mention it that is odd it's not working like i thought it would after specifying the dataType as json and including app.use(bodyParser.json());
[15:03:18] <robertmaxrees> because the datatype has nothing to do with the data being sent to the servber.
[15:03:21] <robertmaxrees> *server
[15:03:35] <randymarsh9> i think that's what you were trying to explain to me all along lol
[15:04:05] <robertmaxrees> right./
[15:04:21] <robertmaxrees> all it does it tell $.ajax() what kind of data you're expecting back.
[15:04:35] <randymarsh9> ohh
[15:04:49] <robertmaxrees> heh
[15:04:51] <randymarsh9> i thought it defines the type you are sending
[15:05:29] <randymarsh9> and was defaulting to the wrong one which is why node body parser couldn't read it
[15:05:59] <robertmaxrees> i said "randymarsh9 yeah - dataType is the type of response you're expecting from the server." about an hour ago soooo
[15:08:06] <grapheti> https://i.imgur.com/kGisi63.png
[15:08:27] <SpecialTech> heya robert how you been
[15:08:47] <randymarsh9> yea thought it could mean both send/receive
[15:09:06] <robertmaxrees> randymarsh9 then i woulda said "is the type of data AND response"
[15:09:08] <robertmaxrees> or something heh
[15:09:35] <randymarsh9> i know it's really my comprhension skills that are just shit lol
[15:10:58] <robertmaxrees> SpecialTech eeeehhhh.  been a rough few months.
[15:11:00] <robertmaxrees> yourself?
[15:11:47] <grapheti> just put 'in bed' on the end of everything
[15:11:55] <grapheti> that makes me happy
[15:12:47] <SpecialTech> Same, i've been non stop working on projects and this hurricane irma that passed put about two weeks dent into my plans lol
[15:13:06] <grapheti> :O
[15:54:07] <StrangeCompany> Does anyone here work professionally as a developer?
[15:57:36] <SpecialTech> I think most of us do
[15:57:53] <SpecialTech> StrangeCompany
[16:00:01] <taplar> doing right now
[16:05:26] <StrangeCompany> Cool, I was just curious
[16:10:42] <hellyeah> what is new on jquery 4?
[16:11:23] <taplar> wut?
[16:11:48] <SpecialTech> 4?
[16:11:51] <SpecialTech> damn
[16:12:19] <taplar> there isn't a 4 yet
[16:12:31] <hellyeah> ah that must be a joke then
[16:12:39] <taplar> at lease according to the http://blog.jquery.com/
[16:13:54] <SpecialTech> yea there is no four]
[16:14:01] <SpecialTech> i mean 2 felt like it was skipped to 3
[16:14:02] <SpecialTech> lol
[16:15:01] <hellyeah> hmm
[16:16:24] <taplar> it wasn't really a linear progression before 3x
[16:16:48] <taplar> or sequential, whatever the proper term is
[16:18:13] <hellyeah> linear , sequential
[16:18:19] <hellyeah> must be similar
[16:18:53] <SpecialTech> pretty similar
[16:19:28] <taplar> well i googled sequential progression and i got geometric progression, so sequential progression may not be a thing
[16:19:47] <taplar> but in any case, 1x didn't preceed 2x
[16:19:56] <taplar> they were parallel development paths
[16:23:37] <hellyeah> i bet you are one of developer taplar
[16:23:53] <taplar> what do you mean?
[16:24:36] <hellyeah> i mean you are one of the guys who develops jquery :D
[16:24:39] <grapheti> https://i.imgur.com/HTmL30U.gif
[16:24:56] <taplar> oh, now way
[16:25:10] <hellyeah> why not?
[16:25:35] <taplar> heh, time, domain knowledge experience, take your pick
[16:26:02] <hellyeah> eh
[16:26:54] <hellyeah> anyway you helped me a lot
[16:26:56] <hellyeah> :)
[16:27:10] <hellyeah> btw what do you think about statement jquery is slow
[16:27:35] <taplar> i think it depends on how you use it
[16:27:56] <hellyeah> hmm what do you mean?
[16:28:07] <hellyeah> I still remember you warning about global lookups
[16:28:18] <taplar> it's not a magical box you throw stuff in and it will perform awesome in all cases
[16:28:33] <taplar> you have to have some understanding of patterns that work to the detriment of it's performance
[16:28:38] <taplar> and avoid them
[16:31:40] <hellyeah> hmm
[16:31:44] <hellyeah> pattern
[16:32:02] <hellyeah> like dependency injection?
[16:32:18] <taplar> logical patterns, in general
[16:32:41] <taplar> not all selectors are equally performant, especially with larger doms
[16:32:57] <taplar> repetitive operations have overhead
[16:33:09] <taplar> lack of caching where caching makes sense
[16:33:13] <taplar> etc
[16:34:20] <taplar> if someone says jquery is slow, the question I would ask is what they are doing in particular that is slow, and then you start evaluating what part of it is slow to see if you can increase the performance
[16:45:43] <hellyeah> taplar:  clear
[17:09:41] <randymarsh9> is the only way to execute some code AFTER an ajax() completes is to put that code inside the elipsis under success: function() { ... } ?
[17:10:01] <taplar> no, you can also use the then() method
[17:10:23] <taplar> or done()
[17:10:33] <taplar> there's various ways to attach callbacks
[17:11:29] <taplar> http://api.jquery.com/category/deferred-object/
[17:12:21] <randymarsh9> taplar: cool, is promise also one of the ones i can use?
[17:12:35] <taplar> $.ajax returns a deferred/promise object
[17:12:43] <taplar> so you operate off of that
[17:12:57] <randymarsh9> okay let me see ty
[17:25:24] <randymarsh9> taplar: *gasp* it's working
[17:25:33] <randymarsh9> taplar: my code is now somewhat readable still. ty!
[17:25:37] <taplar> lol
[17:25:43] <taplar> congrats
[17:26:53] <randymarsh9> yea i was pretty close to shoving a gazilion lines into my ajax success callback... that would've been ugly
[17:27:11] <robertmaxrees> functions are cool.
[17:27:15] <taplar> ^
[17:27:17] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[17:28:39] <robertmaxrees> i have a rough rule of thumb: if it's a one or two-liner, fat arrow is a-ok.  anything more than that or if I need to pull out a normal function, abstract it and give it a name.
[17:29:18] <taplar> i still lean towards named methods in any case.  pre-compiling is kewl
[17:29:34] <robertmaxrees> entirely depends on the framework/library.
[17:30:21] <taplar> we saw some speed gains with doing that with jq
[17:30:35] <Jidda> Is there any jquery plugin to allow me to implement like this https://imgur.com/a/UbEyr
[17:30:43] <Jidda> Clicking any button on the menu will switch to content panel without reloading a page. To return back to Navigation Tab you will to click on Back button at the top.
[17:30:50] <taplar> one of our guys even went into the source and played around with making the anonymous methods named, and got some speed there
[17:31:09] <taplar> lost some memory, but there was a trade off
[17:32:22] <taplar> Jidda: that seems like it could be a bootstrap thing
[17:32:53] <Jidda> taplar I don't think so
[17:33:10] <StrangeCompany> I'm getting an error relating to a function not being defined in <body onload="myFunction()"> It's been working for a while, I'm not sure why it'd be undefined all of a sudden
[17:33:30] <Jidda> taplar It is a toggle between tab-list and content panel
[17:33:40] <robertmaxrees> StrangeCompany don't use onload fwiw.
[17:33:45] <taplar> right, BS does tabs and such
[17:34:13] <StrangeCompany> Why not?
[17:34:15] <Jidda> yes but tab-list get disappeared after clicking on them
[17:34:28] <robertmaxrees> StrangeCompany putting js in your html is kinda funky.
[17:34:36] <robertmaxrees> use $(window).onLoad() instead.
[17:34:37] <taplar> which would suggest if it was done with BS would involve some custom css
[17:34:48] <taplar> i'm just talking about possibilities
[17:34:51] <StrangeCompany> Thanks Robert
[17:35:26] <Jidda> They are using angular but not bootstrap
[17:35:47] <robertmaxrees> https://www.codementor.io/chrisharrington/angularjs-tutorial-series-part-3-how-to-make-a-sliding-menu-with-directives-8eo8snfqf
[17:35:47] <taplar> i'm saying it could possibly be done with bs
[17:35:49] <Jidda> <a class="sf-sidebar-menu-item ng-binding" ng-click="selectSetting($index)" ng-attr-title="{{setting.heading}}" title="Header">
[17:35:54] <taplar> you asked if there was a jquery way to do that
[17:38:14] <StrangeCompany> Is $(window).onload(function) the syntax? Not seeing the documentation for it in Google
[17:38:22] <robertmaxrees> err.
[17:38:27] <StrangeCompany> Just a bunch of stuff about window.load and $(document).ready
[17:38:44] <robertmaxrees> $(window).load()
[17:38:45] <robertmaxrees> my bad.
[17:38:54] <StrangeCompany> No problem! Appreciate the help
[17:39:06] <taplar> api.jquery.com/on
[17:39:40] <cannap> $(document).ready(()) is that not the same?
[17:39:48] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[17:39:50] <robertmaxrees> and actually
[17:39:51] <robertmaxrees> https://stackoverflow.com/a/22183784/923919
[17:39:56] <robertmaxrees> .on('load' is the right way.
[17:40:09] <robertmaxrees> cannap document ready fires before the window load event
[17:40:10] <cannap> oh
[17:40:23] <robertmaxrees> document ready can fire well before assets are done loading.
[17:40:40] <cannap> ah
[17:40:57] <cannap> also will handle prefetch
[17:41:00] <cannap> and such stuff?
[17:41:26] <StrangeCompany> Weird
[17:41:31] <taplar> http://api.jquery.com/ready/
[17:41:32] <StrangeCompany> It's still telling me it's undefined
[17:41:40] <cannap> nvm @StrangeCompany dont listen to me ^^
[17:42:07] <cannap> show full code
[17:42:09] <taplar> 'where' is it telling you undefined?
[17:42:10] <StrangeCompany> I got it!
[17:42:19] <StrangeCompany> I had to put window.onload under document.ready?
[17:42:25] <StrangeCompany> I'm not sure why it worked necessarily, but it did
[17:42:26] <taplar> no
[17:42:42] <taplar> $(window).on('load', function(){ ... });
[17:42:52] <taplar> outside of the ready
[17:43:01] <StrangeCompany> I went with this syntax window.onload = function() {}
[17:43:05] <StrangeCompany> Outside of document.ready, it didn't work
[17:43:07] <StrangeCompany> Inside it, it does
[17:43:36] <robertmaxrees> what's failing?
[17:43:41] <StrangeCompany> I'll try tap's method rq
[17:44:13] <cannap> what are you try todo? maybe out of scope?
[17:44:47] <StrangeCompany> With tap's syntax, it's still calling undefined. That's super weird.
[17:45:01] <StrangeCompany> Scope, maybe, but I'm not sure
[17:45:08] <taplar> can you show us with a fiddle?
[17:45:09] <StrangeCompany> It's a function I have defined for a digital clock on the page
[17:45:12] <StrangeCompany> yeah
[17:45:23] <StrangeCompany> Do you want to see the non-working or working version?
[17:45:26] <cannap> does the clock return a event?
[17:45:30] <taplar> non-working
[17:45:39] <cannap> oO
[17:46:13] <cannap> anyway its 2017 no one want a clock on the page or you have special usecase for it^^
[17:46:58] <taplar> how do you know it's 2017 without the clock on the page?
[17:47:10] <cannap> google
[17:47:14] <taplar> lol
[17:47:38] <taplar> madness!!!  *waves hands wildly*
[17:47:47] <grapheti> https://youtu.be/9jK-NcRmVcw?t=46s
[17:48:02] <taplar> nic
[17:50:07] <taplar> i saw a svg css clock the other day
[17:52:38] <StrangeCompany> Hm
[17:52:54] <grapheti> https://codepen.io/fauxparse/pen/OVpbwa
[17:52:56] <StrangeCompany> I can't get the working version to work in jsfiddle, but anyway, this is what the non-working version looked like in terms of syntax
[17:54:30] <StrangeCompany> https://jsfiddle.net/Lg40s4oc/
[17:55:28] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/Lg40s4oc/1/
[17:55:32] <taplar> added jquery
[17:55:44] <hybridwebdev> Im hoping someone can shed some insight into a problem I'm having
[17:55:52] <StrangeCompany> LOL
[17:55:54] <StrangeCompany> Thanks
[17:56:07] <taplar> you said that's the non-working version?
[17:56:13] <StrangeCompany> But like I said, that still doesn't work for what I have
[17:56:22] <StrangeCompany> I have insert window.onload under document.ready for it work on my end
[17:57:01] <hybridwebdev> https://jsfiddle.net/neh0wwLv/
[17:57:06] <StrangeCompany> Let me look again
[17:57:11] <hybridwebdev> say i have a nested set of .elemen divs
[17:57:30] <hybridwebdev> i want to create an array of said divs in the order they appear eg:
[17:57:40] <robertmaxrees> StrangeCompany what's the code you have, exactly?
[17:58:03] <hybridwebdev> [elemen] => array('element'=>array('element)) etc
[17:58:11] <taplar> hybridwebdev: what order, specifically?
[17:58:24] <hybridwebdev> @taplar nested in the order they appear in the dom
[17:58:29] <StrangeCompany> There's a lot of it
[17:58:30] <hybridwebdev> i've tried $.toArray
[17:58:38] <StrangeCompany> I pulled what was relevant
[17:58:53] <StrangeCompany> I could share more of it, I guess
[17:59:02] <taplar> fwiw, arrays don't have string keys in js
[17:59:13] <taplar> but are you talking about a flat array?
[17:59:22] <taplar> one dimensional?
[17:59:34] <hybridwebdev> well let's say a nested array with unique ids
[18:00:04] <taplar> so an array of objects, with nested arrays of objects
[18:00:11] <hybridwebdev> based on dom order
[18:00:14] <hybridwebdev> yes
[18:00:24] <taplar> that's... kinda what the dom is already
[18:00:30] <taplar> heh
[18:00:48] <hybridwebdev> but doing something like $('.elemn) doesn't give you a nested object, it gives you a flat object
[18:00:55] <hybridwebdev> i want them in the order they appear in dom
[18:01:04] <taplar> you'll have to build that yourself then
[18:01:08] <StrangeCompany> robertmaxrees https://jsfiddle.net/Lg40s4oc/2/ This is what my version has to look like to work in my browser. It doesn't work in the fiddle, though, which is why I'm really confused.
[18:01:19] <taplar> most likely involving some form of recurssion
[18:01:30] <StrangeCompany> Just looking at the fiddle, tap seems to be correct in saying it should be outside of document.ready() normally
[18:01:55] <hybridwebdev> @taplar that's what i thought, I'd assume using something like map would help with that
[18:01:58] <StrangeCompany> As $(window).on('load', function()) or whatever
[18:02:15] <taplar> map() is just a translator
[18:02:34] <taplar> you're going to have to find the elements and for each one, find it's nested ones, and for each one of those, find its ....
[18:02:40] <taplar> and build the resulting structure as you go
[18:02:55] <grapheti> I see recursion in your future
[18:02:59] <taplar> yup
[18:03:12] <hybridwebdev> @taplar there ought to be some jquery method that does that
[18:03:25] <taplar> this isn't a very common case operation, really
[18:03:40] <taplar> not much of a reason to bake it into the core
[18:03:52] <taplar> imho
[18:04:21] <hybridwebdev> a method that finds elemensts in nested order is kinda standard required functionality imo
[18:04:29] <hybridwebdev> i can think of a million cases for it
[18:04:41] <taplar> i'd disagree.  i've worked on lots of apps.  never needed it, :)
[18:04:47] <robertmaxrees> hybridwebdev that's a bit of a code smell imo.
[18:05:03] <hybridwebdev> code smell?
[18:05:25] <taplar> things which may hint that there are logical issues with some software
[18:05:41] <taplar> logical/structural
[18:05:46] <robertmaxrees> ^ in this case, having the same class on a bunch of nested divs hints that the naming convention might be a bit of an issue.
[18:06:00] <hybridwebdev> naw
[18:06:14] <taplar> gotta head out.  later all
[18:06:15] <hybridwebdev> i need to take a set of elements and convert/format them for a save feature
[18:06:15] <robertmaxrees> heh
[18:06:43] <robertmaxrees> hybridwebdev i'd still argue that your naming convention is a little funky then (shrug)
[18:06:52] <hybridwebdev> lol
[18:07:32] <hybridwebdev> @robertmaxrees right, because it's crazy to think elements may have unique ids in a dom
[18:07:34] <hybridwebdev> lol
[18:08:02] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[18:08:02] <hybridwebdev> or that there's a valid reason for needing the data of a  structured order of elements
[18:08:43] <hybridwebdev> @robertmaxrees https://jsfiddle.net/neh0wwLv/
[18:09:08] <StrangeCompany> hybrid, they're just trying to help
[18:09:48] <hybridwebdev> @StrangeCompany funny, because i've had 0 suggestions, only comments about how I shouldn't need to do what i wanna do
[18:09:59] <robertmaxrees> hybridwebdev calm down duder.
[18:10:05] <hybridwebdev> .......
[18:10:06] <StrangeCompany> I'm just saying don't take it so personally
[18:10:16] <robertmaxrees> you can do what you wanna do - a recursive set of .map() calls.
[18:10:30] <robertmaxrees> it's just more complicated than it needs to be.
[18:10:44] <hybridwebdev> lol
[18:10:45] <hybridwebdev> see
[18:10:57] <robertmaxrees> i just gave you a suggestion on what to do.
[18:11:15] <hybridwebdev> .......done wasting time
[18:11:25] <robertmaxrees> enjoy then!
[18:11:31] <grapheti> You're supposed to code it for him robertmaxrees
[18:11:36] <grapheti> smh
[18:11:37] <robertmaxrees> lol
[18:11:40] <grapheti> :P
[18:11:42] <hybridwebdev> lol my times $80 an hr, i don't have time for stupidity
[18:11:51] <StrangeCompany> Yeah, it's like you want an answer without your methods being questioned. Sometimes they have to be if you want to learn how to do something better.
[18:12:01] <StrangeCompany> No reason to get upset, it's all good
[18:12:06] <StrangeCompany> Well lol
[18:12:15] <grapheti> ppl ppl
[18:12:21] <grapheti> Trolls are late today.
[18:12:28] <robertmaxrees> (shrug)
[18:12:36] <StrangeCompany> He was just being sensitive
[18:12:43] <StrangeCompany> Oh well
[18:12:54] <robertmaxrees> heh, his problem.  not ours.  movign on!
[18:13:01] <grapheti> 30 more minutes till I leave!
[18:13:12] <robertmaxrees> rad
[18:13:16] <grapheti> :D
[18:13:23] <grapheti> How's the band?
[18:13:27] <StrangeCompany> where are you headed?
[18:13:35] <grapheti> Home to game.
[18:13:48] <robertmaxrees> it's good grapheti! gotta gig this friday.  looking forward to that.
[18:13:51] <StrangeCompany> what do you play?
[18:13:58] <robertmaxrees> guitar and I sing.
[18:13:59] <StrangeCompany> that question could apply to both of you apparently
[18:14:07] <grapheti> robertmaxrees, yay!
[18:14:12] <grapheti> gratz
[18:14:16] <robertmaxrees> yeah.  first one after becoming single again, too.
[18:14:19] <StrangeCompany> that's awesome. i can play guitar a little bit, mostly just strumming.
[18:14:25] <robertmaxrees> should be a really good time :)
[18:14:28] <grapheti> sweet
[18:14:31] <poboy> ooh, you in a band robertmaxrees?
[18:14:32] <StrangeCompany> what kind of music?
[18:14:40] <grapheti> have them crawl all over ya!
[18:14:46] <robertmaxrees> bit of everything.  Beatles to Journey to SRV to Maroon 5.
[18:14:49] <robertmaxrees> all kinds of stuff.
[18:15:02] <poboy> I used to be in a band.  Now I'm old and boring
[18:15:08] <StrangeCompany> It's a cover band, then?
[18:15:13] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[18:15:19] <grapheti> that's awesome
[18:15:21] <StrangeCompany> Sweet
[18:15:30] <robertmaxrees> though our main singer might have to ditch out early next year in which case i'll start up something else.
[18:15:42] <robertmaxrees> looking at doing a more blues/rock/soul kinda thing.  maybe toss in a few originals.
[18:16:22] <StrangeCompany> Songwriting is fun as shit
[18:16:27] <StrangeCompany> I can't play/sing worth a damn though
[18:16:51] <robertmaxrees> neither can i ;)
[18:17:08] <grapheti> Or I (or I, or I, or I...)
[18:17:16] <robertmaxrees> that's why i play lead guitar hahahaha
[18:17:28] <grapheti> :D
[18:19:33] <StrangeCompany> How old are yall? I'm 25
[18:22:09] <robertmaxrees> 30
[18:23:09] <poboy> 76
[18:23:12] <StrangeCompany> tap mentioned most of you guys are working developers. How long have y'all been coding?
[18:23:15] <poboy> 32
[18:23:21] <StrangeCompany> Whoa! 76?!
[18:23:28] <StrangeCompany> Hahaha, oh
[18:23:28] <poboy> lol, I feel like it
[18:23:29] <robertmaxrees> hahahaha
[18:24:12] <robertmaxrees> I've been a developer for like... 10 years or so now?
[18:24:31] <StrangeCompany> That's awesome, dude. Did you study it in school or just pick it up?
[18:24:41] <robertmaxrees> picked it up outta necessity.
[18:24:47] <poboy> I made a career change and I'm old for a dev it seems.  :)
[18:25:02] <poboy> although we do have a 55 y/o on the team.
[18:25:23] <StrangeCompany> I hear you. I'm doing the same, pretty much. Although I did grow up loving computers and the internet.
[18:25:39] <robertmaxrees> i worked for a company that did whitelabel sites for newspapers. had layoffs and lost the main dev who was doing the dev work.  had deadlines to meet, so i learned.
[18:25:42] <StrangeCompany> I felt old getting into it at 24!
[18:26:14] <StrangeCompany> Cool, so you primarily do web dev?
[18:27:01] <robertmaxrees> yep.  i spend about 80% of my time in JS these days.,
[18:27:39] <poboy> My buddy's been doing this since high school and about 3 years ago got me into it.  I did PHP/MYSQL mostly backend stuff and just got my first full time gig 2 months ago.  They want me doing everything so I'm on here almost daily asking stupid jquery questions.  :)
[18:28:28] <StrangeCompany> Very cool. Do you stick with vanilla/jQuery or have you tried Angular/React? I've messed around with Angular A LITTLE, but really found myself at home with React, recently. I like it a lot. jQuery has a way of making things very simple though, when applied correctly.
[18:28:30] <poboy> We're building software for bankers and lawyers.
[18:28:45] <StrangeCompany> I don't know. I've just really enjoyed the journey of learning it, you know? I never thought I would even get to where I'm at now with it.
[18:30:29] <StrangeCompany> poboy, That sounds fancy! Congratulations on getting your first position like that. Having a friend that can be a bit of a mentor is extremely helpful, at least, it has been in my case. He got me kickstarted. Now I have to come to IRC when I need help. :)
[18:31:34] <poboy> Yeah, I feel like I've learned nothing when I see how basic these questions are that I ask.  But 2 months ago I had never messed with jquery, now I'm getting paid to use it, heh
[18:33:36] <StrangeCompany> Keep living the dream. One thing I noticed once I started down the rabbit hole was just how different coding was in comparison to my expectations/the impression I'd been given through media and hearsay. I'd wanted to do it since I was really young, but always assumed it was inaccessible to me. Now here I am, working on half-ass full stack stuff.
[18:35:16] <poboy> StrangeCompany, awesome man.  The days just fly by and this stuff is so much fun
[18:35:25] <robertmaxrees> ^
[18:35:53] <StrangeCompany> I'm praying it leads me somewhere good.
[18:36:06] <robertmaxrees> it will.
[18:36:30] <StrangeCompany> :)
[18:38:03] <robertmaxrees> what did you do before?
[18:47:45] <poboy> me?  I was a manager of an optical labratory.  making eyeglass lenses
[18:47:53] <poboy> very unrelated field.  :D
[18:49:30] <randymarsh9> robertmaxrees: remember earlier i was asking about different callback methods when doing an ajax post?
[18:49:42] <robertmaxrees> kinda?
[18:49:53] <randymarsh9> well i ended up adding a .done() but now it only works if the ajax succeeds
[18:50:06] <randymarsh9> if the ajax goes to error it doesn't fire
[18:50:10] <robertmaxrees> right.
[18:50:15] <robertmaxrees> (use .then() btw)
[18:50:15] <randymarsh9> any idea why that might be?
[18:50:23] <robertmaxrees> because the call is failing./
[18:50:29] <randymarsh9> hm
[18:50:42] <robertmaxrees> mind sharing the code?
[18:50:55] <randymarsh9> so it thinks it never finishes?
[18:50:57] <randymarsh9> sure one sec
[18:52:04] <robertmaxrees> no, it finishes.  it's just not meeting your success criteria.

[18:53:32] <robertmaxrees> what are you getting backl from the server?
[18:53:35] <robertmaxrees> *back
[18:53:51] <randymarsh9> lol i'm getting something back
[18:53:54] <randymarsh9> i removed it hang on
[18:54:06] <robertmaxrees> also: is there only the one ajax call in this case?
[18:54:50] <randymarsh9> robertmaxrees: ok it's more like this
[18:54:54] <randymarsh9> https://jsfiddle.net/eL23abtf/
[18:55:01] <randymarsh9> yes
[18:55:03] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[18:55:14] <robertmaxrees> so what is the response from the server like?
[18:55:22] <randymarsh9> its an integer
[18:55:28] <robertmaxrees> dataType: "json",
[18:55:29] <robertmaxrees> that's why.
[18:55:31] <robertmaxrees> take that out.
[18:55:32] <robertmaxrees> pls./
[18:55:47] <randymarsh9> i think i need that though..
[18:55:47] <robertmaxrees> also: https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/eL23abtf/1/
[18:55:50] <robertmaxrees> you don';t.
[18:56:00] <randymarsh9> i'm doing this in a really weird way but it's the only way i could get it working
[18:56:04] <robertmaxrees> that's the format of the response from the server.
[18:56:14] <robertmaxrees> if you include that and don't send back JSON, it'll error.
[18:56:25] <robertmaxrees> you're sending back a number.  a number is not json.
[18:56:41] <randymarsh9> but that part still works
[18:57:06] <robertmaxrees> duder
[18:57:06] <robertmaxrees> heh
[18:57:09] <randymarsh9> lol
[18:57:11] <robertmaxrees> you just said that sometimes it doesn't./

[18:57:37] <robertmaxrees> randymarsh9 https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/eL23abtf/2/
[18:57:41] <randymarsh9> what i meant is the error callback doesn't execute when i have the promise set up this way
[18:57:56] <robertmaxrees> randymarsh9 because you're not using the promises correctly.
[18:57:57] <jak2000> i want display an alert when user click on a option (select)

[18:58:04] <jak2000> but why not display it?
[18:58:19] <randymarsh9> if i remove the var ajaxPromise, and the .when .done mumbo jumbo then the "success" and "error" callbacks fire as expected
[18:58:27] <jak2000> when you choose 'abc' would display an alert....

[18:59:51] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[18:59:59] <jak2000> :)

[19:03:11] <robertmaxrees> better if you don't use jQuery (latest) and actually pick the most recent version for fiddles.

[19:12:21] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[19:13:16] <StrangeCompany> I think jQuery UI is separate from jQuery

[19:14:32] <jak2000> StrangeCompany thanks
[21:42:05] <Xplic1T> whats wrong with my syntax
[21:42:08] <Xplic1T>     var getresult = $.base64.decode(getval)
[21:42:18] <Xplic1T> returns undefined but getval is good
[21:49:15] <Xplic1T> this is getval
[21:49:16] <Xplic1T>     var getval = $('#challenge').val();
[21:57:16] <solice> Xplic1T do you have a base64 library initialised?
[22:00:46] <Xplic1T> solice here https://jsfiddle.net/onigetoc/g0y8qr9a/
[22:01:25] <Xplic1T> works here without other script ... $.base64.decode("string") doesn't work ... something isn't exposed correctly
[22:03:24] <solice> yeah it is on the left under External Resources
[22:04:08] <solice> remove that library and it will stop working
[22:04:22] <Xplic1T> fuck
[22:04:24] <Xplic1T> thanks
[22:05:53] <solice> :+1:
[22:08:16] <Xplic1T> yeah that was it
