[00:53:13] <Blahblah> Hi
[00:53:26] <Blahblah> #javascript /join
[01:10:03] <DexDeadly> Question, if I use .submit will it submit the entire form using post?
[01:12:33] <Uhkis> depends on the forms action
[01:12:40] <Uhkis> *method, sorry
[01:19:14] <DexDeadly> http://bestpph.website/admin/game_list.php# click edit game, I have a modal.  When you hit Update Game it submits the form to a page but then refreshes the entire page
[01:19:34] <DexDeadly> I'd like to see if its possible that when you hit update that I can just have the games reload based off the dropdowns
[01:21:51] <Uhkis> you'll need ajax for that
[01:22:55] <DexDeadly> so do I send it using post and .serialize
[01:23:25] <DexDeadly> then in the javascript just rerun the function that already is placiing the data in there in the first place
[01:24:32] <Uhkis> if by post you mean $.post(), yes
[01:26:11] <DexDeadly> yes
[01:26:22] <DexDeadly> OK hmmm
[01:29:20] <DexDeadly> Should the function start by tying the submit button to start the fuction
[01:40:02] <DexDeadly> if you have a good example I could look at offhand that'd be nice.  If not I'll continue to poke
[03:17:48] <DexDeadly> https://jsfiddle.net/b6sc17x6/ I have this currently set up on my site.  Now it submits the data however it is triggering the error.  I'm not sure why other then should there be something coming back from the update_game_data.php page? Also upon success can I dismiss the modal?  Would that be apart of the success part?
[03:19:09] <DexDeadly> also I'm not sure if this needs to be echoed back but part of the post data has a value called event. I need this value to rerun a function to populate data on the main modal page.  This way the data just saved will now show and not have to refresh the entire page.
[04:56:08] <Aeroraver> anyone here have experience using jquery in a .NET MVC 5 application?
[04:59:53] <rcyr> In what way are those two related?
[05:00:43] <Aeroraver> because the views in a MVC 5 application are html, and you can use javascript and jquery in them
[05:02:00] <rcyr> I don't have any experience with MVC5 but perhaps I could help.
[05:03:20] <Aeroraver> the problem is, i made a juery script with help of robert to select all items in a list with checkboxes and send them to a preview label. in my fiddle it works just fine, but when i load the jquery code in my application it doesn't work
[05:04:19] <Aeroraver> the list items <li> are filled in, the <ul> is static. i've done something similar with only 1 item and that did work
[05:07:52] <Uhkis> showing the fiddle would probably help
[05:08:27] <Aeroraver> https://jsfiddle.net/aeroraver/eypxphab/5/
[05:13:02] <Aeroraver> so the thing is, i have those 3 filter items, in my application the contents of those are dynamicaly generated, and i use jquery to filter the items in the list below.
[05:14:03] <Aeroraver> the contents of the items is send to a preview label. the contents of these are also dynamicaly generated. in the fiddle it works, but in my application it doesn't
[05:25:35] <Aeroraver> any ideas?
[05:51:47] <Aeroraver> ok, i got a different question, is it possible to only allow a function to trigger when certain conditions are met?
[07:24:35] <compact> hi guys. I'm using jquery datatbles on my magento store. now I'm looking at lazy loading or defer rendering, however building the datatbles search class into magneto will be a nightmare

[07:24:43] <compact> ?
[08:33:16] <Mark____> does anyone know what kind of jquery preloader this website is using? http://xetemplate.cafe24.com/fullpage_onepage#home/3
[08:59:48] <gagi_new> how do you know that it's jquery?
[09:05:43] <labsy> hi all. I am using jquery datatables and my problem is that the ajax query appends a trailing "_=$TIMESTAMP"
[09:05:46] <labsy> how can I disable that?
[09:05:53] <labsy> because my API does not understand this.
[09:06:20] <labsy> I tried "cache": true (and false) but same problem.
[09:13:55] <labsy> I even tried cache: true in $.ajaxSetup
[09:13:58] <labsy> same problem.
[09:15:13] <labsy> ok now it works. got it.
[10:08:15] <gagi_new> labsy: I am using datatables alot in my current project and never yet encountered this problem, but that could be because I haven't used timestamps, only formated dates....
[10:18:08] <labsy> gagi_new: it is the timestamp the ajax request is making automatically
[10:18:29] <labsy> I got rid of it by saying ajax: { url: ..., cache: true } in my datatables definitions.
[10:19:18] <gagi_new> labsy: ok, good to know.
[10:31:08] <afidegnum> hello, please can anyone give me an editable list with add record option?
[10:31:14] <afidegnum> I m searching but can't find appropriate answer,
[10:36:07] <gagi_new> It's not just jquery , if the records aren't just vars in an array.
[10:41:30] <afidegnum> ??
[11:19:35] <gagi_new> afidegnum: please explain yourself ? whatare you looking for?
