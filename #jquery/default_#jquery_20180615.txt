[00:24:31] <jak2000> Cork?
[00:24:36] <jak2000> are you there friend?
[01:35:21] <James0r> what is the difference between these 2 lines? the result appears to be the same https://i.imgur.com/W4eObBf.png
[01:38:19] <pavonia> The second one requires the div to be inside of another div, the first one doesn't
[01:40:30] <James0r> pavonia ahh okay i changed its parent to a section, and indeed. okay thanks
[01:41:07] <James0r> basic css combinator. i'm still rough with the combinators sometimes.
[05:33:44] <bobdobbs> How do I trigger a transition from jQuery? At the moment I'm change a max-height property. I can change it using .css(). But the transition doesn't trigger
[05:33:50] <bobdobbs> https://codepen.io/anon/pen/wXrMQY
[05:45:53] <AdamPDotty> not a jquery problem
[05:50:17] <bobdobbs> no?
[05:50:53] <preference> bobdobbs: try /join #css
[05:51:41] <bobdobbs> I'm not sure how to frame "how do I trigger a css transition from jquery" as a css problem.
[05:52:25] <bobdobbs> I mean, I'm asking about how to use the css() method
[05:56:20] <Cork> bobdobbs: the normal hack is to do .height() and then .addClass('class that causes the transition')
[05:56:35] <Cork> you can't trigger transition with .css()
[05:56:42] <bobdobbs> ah, I see
[05:57:05] <Cork> well, actually if you have a transition sat it can do it too
[05:57:29] <Cork> .height(); .css('property', 'new-value')
[05:57:46] <Cork> .height() is to trigger the browser to "see" the current css values
[05:58:08] <Cork> (might not always be needed)
[06:00:22] <bobdobbs> hmm
[06:01:36] <ExeciN> Hi people. I'm trying to make a userscript. This is how far I got: https://gist.github.com/nicexe/b1208ee6ab0ffc4a2fe560adbb17d9e7
[06:01:47] <ExeciN> how do I get the values for each recipe and update each recipe with the ratio?
[06:02:06] <ExeciN> I could do a for loop or a foreach loop to iterate through the recipes but I feel like there is a jQuery way that is a lot simpler
[06:02:45] <Cork> ExeciN: you want to do recipes.each(function() {})
[06:02:54] * Cork afk
[06:03:17] <ExeciN> thanks
[06:08:06] <bobdobbs> Cork: the thing is, I can't really set a hard value for 'height'. I want the height to be naturally what it would be depending on the height of it's contents. But afaict you can't do a transition to 'auto'
[06:08:27] <Cork> bobdobbs: no no not set it's a get
[06:09:16] <Cork> bobdobbs: if the question is how to transition from height: auto to height: <someting else> that is a #css question (though the answer is, you can't)
[06:10:02] <bobdobbs> true, that part of the problem is a css issue
[06:11:31] <bobdobbs> But yeah, if indeed transitions won't work with css() then I'll take a different approach anyway
[06:12:06] <Cork> bobdobbs: transition triggers when the computed value of an element changes
[06:12:18] <Cork> you can't set "transition from a to b"
[06:12:28] <Cork> same applies to .css()
[06:29:09] <thykka> bobdobbs, you can sort of use max-height to transition from auto to X
[06:29:30] <thykka> bobdobbs, but the duration is not exact, and you'll have to determine a maximum height..
[06:40:17] <ExeciN> I can't seem to select a specific element, console log displays nothing. what am I doing wrong? https://gist.github.com/nicexe/b1208ee6ab0ffc4a2fe560adbb17d9e7
[06:44:48] <thykka> ExeciN, I'm not 100% sure, but I think the load event might've already been fired at the point where the userscript kicks in
[06:48:22] <thykka> ExeciN, this should work https://gist.github.com/thykka/642b1371276fb4c7841a3e8ba20d308d/revisions#diff-df7953d73ebcb688eb19deed6d1cd35a
[06:50:30] <ExeciN> thykka: thanks, now at least I'm getting this error TypeError: value.children is not a function
[06:50:45] <ExeciN> why would it not work before?
[06:51:26] <thykka> your 'value' within .each is a DOM node, not a jQuery collection
[06:51:35] <thykka> you should wrap it again, if you want to use jquery methods on it
[06:54:15] <ExeciN> like $(value) ?
[06:56:34] <ExeciN> wow, it worked!
[06:56:37] <ExeciN> thanks
[07:07:07] <thykka> np!
[07:21:31] <ExeciN> this is the end product: https://gist.github.com/nicexe/607551cf24ffd56858994023c6b6bebf
[07:21:46] <ExeciN> it isn't entirely done the jQuery way but it works
[11:23:58] <ahoo> hi
[11:24:03] <ahoo> first element after body?
[11:24:10] <taplar> nipples
[11:24:15] <taplar> what's the question?
[11:24:30] <ahoo> do you really need more information?
[11:24:34] <taplar> i do
[11:24:40] <ahoo> well then
[11:24:44] <taplar> 'after' body could mean different things
[11:24:52] <ahoo> how do i select the first element after body?
[11:24:55] <taplar> do you mean first child of the body, or literally the next element?
[11:25:08] <ahoo> the first child
[11:25:23] <taplar> $(document.body).children().eq(0)
[11:25:24] <ahoo> there's no next element to 'body' btw.
[11:25:34] <taplar> i know that.  i don't know that you don't know that
[11:26:20] <ahoo> thanks!
[11:26:21] <taplar> which is why asking for the next element is confusing
[11:26:53] <ahoo> i was asking for the next element "after"
[11:26:55] <ahoo> not "next to"
[11:27:00] <taplar> it's not after either, :)
[11:27:13] <ahoo> if it is i not after, what is it?
[11:27:16] <taplar> it's "under"
[11:27:23] <taplar> it's a tree
[11:27:37] <ahoo> that could be next to, too.
[11:27:41] <taplar> nope
[11:28:06] <taplar> in the html it may look like the 'next' element, but it's not in the dom
[11:28:55] <ahoo> well, in any case i enjoyed the conversation that could have been under 100 characters also.
[11:29:08] <taplar> language is important
[11:29:21] <ahoo> exactamente.
[11:39:12] <ahoo> alright.
[11:39:38] <ahoo> how do i wrap all elements under body with another element?
[11:40:30] <taplar> iirc there is a wrap() method in jQuery
[11:41:04] <taplar> http://api.jquery.com/wrap/  and http://api.jquery.com/wrapAll/
[11:41:15] <taplar> depending if you want to wrap them all or individually
[11:51:13] <cariveri> Hi. is there a "quick" packages of the sources (js/css files) to replicate this example https://bowercdn.net/c/jquery.ui-1.8.1/demos/datepicker/localization.html
[11:52:42] <taplar> you might could find that on the jquery ui website
[11:52:57] <taplar> i don't remember if they package all the localizations in with their default download or not
[11:53:58] <cariveri> taplar: I was having a look there, but couldnt find something quick. I dont want to include the whole mass sotospeak.
[11:54:26] <taplar> Their download page is built so you can choose what you want to download
[11:55:00] <taplar> however for something really quick, there are google cdn caches for jQuery ui.  https://developers.google.com/speed/libraries/#jquery-ui
[12:09:56] <cariveri> taplar: have a look: https://jsfiddle.net/6xqs2yct/2/  whats the next step to get the locale to work?
[12:11:19] <taplar> ah, so that would suggest that the core does not include that locale.  so you'd have to get a reference to that
[12:11:31] <taplar> also as a side note, you are using jsfiddle in correctly
[12:11:49] <taplar> you are including jquery stuff in the external resources and in the markup, and you are trying to build a whole page
[12:12:04] <cariveri> taplar: I know. I copy pasted to be quicker
[12:13:41] <ahoo> taplar: apparently, even though the documentation tells otherwise, either wrapAll is not the right thing or the selector you gave me.
[12:14:09] <taplar> are you trying to put them all in a single element, or each one in an element?
[12:14:17] <ahoo> taplar: what i'm trying to do is wrap all body content in a <div style="margin:0 auto;width:970px;">
[12:14:48] <ahoo> i want to put them all into a single div
[12:15:03] <taplar> cariveri: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/tree/master/ui/i18n  check out this repo.  it has all the locales.  You can reference one of those if you use rawgit.com
[12:15:10] <taplar> ahoo: k, one sec
[12:16:45] <taplar> ahoo: http://jsfiddle.net/j2v3wqgu/1/  an example
[12:19:34] <ahoo> taplar: you sir, are a hero. thanks!
[12:19:41] <taplar> sure
[12:36:11] <cariveri> taplar: well, then the raw file include shuld work too. but doesnt . https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jquery/jquery-ui/master/ui/i18n/datepicker-de.js
[12:36:24] <cariveri> taplar: please, if you know hw to: https://jsfiddle.net/6xqs2yct/9/
[12:40:09] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/6xqs2yct/12/
[12:40:27] <taplar> the githubusercontent was not serving the file up as an executable js file.  it was serving it up as a text file
[12:43:51] <ahoo> $('body').css('backgroundColor: rgb(255,255,255)');
[12:43:56] <ahoo> undefined
[12:44:01] <ahoo> $('body').css('backgroundColor')
[12:44:05] <ahoo> "rgb(38, 62, 87)"
[12:44:15] <ahoo> what am i doing wrong?
[12:44:38] <ahoo> (adding !important doesn't work either)
[12:44:57] <ahoo> (the above is console input/output)
[12:45:33] <taplar_brb> afaik you can't set !important inline
[12:46:15] <taplar> but setting it would be either $(...).css('backgroundColor', 'newValue'); or $(...).css({'backgroundColor': 'newValue'})
[12:46:35] <taplar> the second version providing an object allows setting multiple things at one time
[12:47:17] <ahoo> afaik it also works by just putting it together in one string
[12:47:26] <ahoo> color:red;backgroundColor:white
[12:47:58] <ahoo> oooooh
[12:48:01] <ahoo> it doesn't
[12:48:05] <taplar> nope
[12:48:08] <ahoo> thanks again, taplar.
[12:48:18] <taplar> you can do that with attr() though
[12:48:27] <taplar> attr('style', 'whatever string you want')
[12:49:22] <taplar> but css() is a wrapper around setting elements on the raw dom element's style property
[12:49:44] <taplar> element.style.backgroundColor = 'newValue'
[12:51:26] <cariveri> taplar: cool thanks. Ill have a look.
[13:10:21] <taplar> and then i decided to stop by jquery, and robert gave me a guilt trip for being away so long!
[13:10:48] <robertmaxrees> >:)
[13:18:14] <robertmaxrees> how've things been btw?
[13:19:46] <taplar> keeping busy.  you?
[13:19:51] <robertmaxrees> 'bout the same.
[13:20:25] <robertmaxrees> tons of meetings.  getting tossed onto the on call rotation.  trying to get more people hired.
[13:20:44] <taplar> on call, woo hoo!
[13:21:03] <taplar> we had some prod issues lately we had to fix which was fun
[13:26:16] <robertmaxrees> that's never fun.  i've been "on call" for a service i wrote, but that's about it.
[13:26:26] <robertmaxrees> what sorts of issues have you been having?
[13:27:17] <taplar> we pushed out a new section on our site, which was a redesign of them.  but then we had some issues crop up with if the user hit the back button, since it's a spa
[13:27:31] <robertmaxrees> aaaaaah
[13:27:40] <robertmaxrees> that's always delightful
[13:27:52] <taplar> which we had to fix those, and really we need to go back and tie the back button in better, but that's a future card
[13:28:18] <taplar> some other things i'm forgetting.  my brain is purging itself on friday
[13:28:52] <taplar> ooooh right
[13:29:13] <taplar> yeah, the redesign also changed the url to parts of the site, and other sites were still going to the old url, so we had to fix that
[13:29:55] <robertmaxrees> that sounds exhausting.
[13:29:55] <taplar> and one of the sites we had to fix, hadn't been deployed in over 8 months, and it had some issues deploying because one of the build/deploy machines didn't exist anymore, lol
[13:30:05] <robertmaxrees> O.o oh woah.
[13:30:16] <taplar> so we're probably going to take that site over in the future
[13:30:29] <robertmaxrees> heh.  give it some love?
[13:30:49] <taplar> i'd personally love to just trash it, but apparently it's a "useful" marketing tool to college kids
[13:31:21] <robertmaxrees> heh.  i'm very familiar with that kind of reasoning.
[13:31:32] <taplar> but it's a static one sheet for the most part so, so long as it stays like that i don't really care
[13:32:35] <robertmaxrees> ezpz then
[13:32:48] <taplar> yeppers
[13:38:42] <taplar> how many people you looking to bring on board?
[13:39:06] <robertmaxrees> "a lot".
[13:39:32] <taplar> the site is going good then, ya?
[13:39:41] <robertmaxrees> we've been way understaffed for a long time.  we're trying to bulk that up.
[13:39:45] <robertmaxrees> *sites :)
[13:39:51] <robertmaxrees> we have like 15-20 sites we run.
[13:39:59] <taplar> ah, i only know the one
[13:41:23] <robertmaxrees> yeah, we have the flagship, and then a bunch of niche stores (that need redesigns badly), and then we bought a company called Living Direct that's also niche stores, but they sell a TON of private label.
[13:41:56] <robertmaxrees> https://www.kegerator.com/ is one of thosxe
[13:41:58] <robertmaxrees> *those
[13:42:43] <taplar> heh, i can tell from the modal that pops up as soon as i go there
[13:42:52] <robertmaxrees> yeah....
[13:42:55] <robertmaxrees> we'
[13:43:00] <robertmaxrees> *we're working on killing that.
[13:43:06] <robertmaxrees> just gotta help marketing see the light.
[13:46:01] <taplar> mmm, on the living direct site, i like the category hover overs
[13:46:32] <robertmaxrees> ah the dim and fade?
[13:46:48] <taplar> oooooh, except for if i try to go to the link while it's collapsed
[13:46:53] <taplar> then i have to chase it
[13:47:09] <robertmaxrees> oh, the thumbnails.
[13:47:12] <robertmaxrees> yeah...
[13:47:27] <robertmaxrees> this was all shopify originally.  we had to reimplement their styles on our platform.,
[13:48:02] <taplar> i'm not familiar with them
[13:48:37] <taplar> ah, so it's a ecommerce platform
[13:48:39] <robertmaxrees> basically an ecom platform that you pay a percentage per transaction for.
[13:48:40] <robertmaxrees> yeah
[14:23:25] <DevilTiger> i'm having a hell of a time getting an on('submit') to fire; whats the easiest way to debug this in dev tools?
[14:24:22] <taplar> can you put in a fiddle what you are trying to do?
[14:24:29] <robertmaxrees> ^
[14:25:03] <taplar> debugging why an event is not firing is tricky
[14:25:17] <taplar> really the first step is to make sure it is binding on the element
[14:25:36] <robertmaxrees> ^ and that the element exists when you bind.
[14:26:05] <robertmaxrees> also: submit events only fire from forms, not submit buttons
[14:26:14] <DevilTiger> yes, http://jsfiddle.net/y3pLzsnw/
[14:26:30] <robertmaxrees> oh.
[14:26:57] <robertmaxrees> binding handlers in other handlers is a bad idea.
[14:27:11] <taplar> ^^^
[14:27:12] <DevilTiger> i dont know what that means
[14:27:18] <DevilTiger> i see one handler
[14:27:18] <taplar> you're only creating the binding if the input changes
[14:27:29] <taplar> and you are going to create the binding every time it changes
[14:27:31] <robertmaxrees> $('[name="myForm"]').on('sumbit', function(e) { is inside the $(':file').on('change', function() {
[14:27:46] <DevilTiger> sorry
[14:27:47] <DevilTiger> http://jsfiddle.net/y3pLzsnw/3/
[14:27:54] <DevilTiger> that was before i removed code that isn't relevant
[14:28:37] <taplar> hold on, by removing code that isn't relevant, do you mean that the code you showed us isn't what you actually have now?
[14:28:39] <DevilTiger> didn't see it was inside that :change
[14:28:47] <robertmaxrees> also:
[14:28:47] <robertmaxrees> sumbit
[14:28:53] <DevilTiger> omg
[14:29:02] <DevilTiger> i quit
[14:29:22] <taplar> side note, look up the form with #myForm, rather than the name lookup
[14:29:27] <robertmaxrees> ^
[14:29:27] <DevilTiger> sorry. let me collect myself and re-elvaluate my life and i'll come back with questions
[14:30:12] <DevilTiger> only reason i used the name lookup was due to #myForm not working...but of course it wasn't...sumbit isn't a listener :)
[14:30:18] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[14:30:23] <DevilTiger> not YET
[14:30:24] <DevilTiger> anyhow
[14:30:39] <taplar> so that's your first step in debugging
[14:30:50] <taplar> start by making sure the elements that you bind on, are being found
[14:30:59] <taplar> console log their selectors
[14:31:04] <taplar> make sure you get > 0
[14:31:09] <taplar> then continue from there
[14:32:06] <DevilTiger> how do you mean logging their selectors
[14:32:16] <taplar> console.log($(selector).length)
[14:32:23] <taplar> the length will tell you how many elements were found
[14:32:36] <DevilTiger> ok. good to know.
[14:32:37] <taplar> if you get 0, your selector is invalid, or the elements do not exist
[14:32:38] <DevilTiger> ty
[14:33:36] <DevilTiger> i'm attempting to use netlify as my host and they take care of the server side aspect but it isn't documented how to do AJAX forms and i'm new at this so its giving me trouble
[14:34:45] <DevilTiger> haven't really figured out how to enforce MIME types for my upload though..i know using JS to verify file type is fairly pointless except for user convenience
[14:36:37] <DevilTiger> hmm still not triggering on('submit')
[14:54:34] <DevilTiger> grr this is pissing me off
[15:00:24] <DevilTiger> if preventDefault is called does the action defined in the form html get used or the URL in the subsequent ajax request
[15:01:58] <taplar> preventDefault stops whatever would normally happen by processing that event
[15:02:08] <taplar> example, clicking a link would transfer the page
[15:02:30] <DevilTiger> ok. i'm still up in the air what takes precedence for form action
[15:02:49] <taplar> if you prevent default for a submit event, it cancels the form submit
[15:02:54] <taplar> as that's the default action
[15:03:08] <DevilTiger> can you bind a console.log on preventDefault
[15:03:19] <taplar> preventDefault isn't an event
[15:03:31] <DevilTiger> idk what the fuck is going on here. if my event listener is even working
[15:03:44] <taplar> you can console log in the same logic where you perform the preventDefault
[15:03:55] <taplar> you can console log pretty much any where statements are allowed
[15:04:36] <DevilTiger> http://jsfiddle.net/qe9w0b6n/
[15:04:58] <DevilTiger> code now. removed the other stuff. none of my console.log's are being triggered
[15:05:29] <taplar> did you console log the form selector?
[15:05:43] <DevilTiger> i dont know
[15:06:02] <taplar> remember earlier how i said you could do that?
[15:06:16] <DevilTiger> not really. this is got me confused
[15:06:18] <DevilTiger> badly
[15:06:46] <taplar> console.log($(selector).length)
[15:07:00] <taplar> do that right before you do the binding logic
[15:07:07] <taplar> binding *create logic
[15:07:25] <DevilTiger> i don't have $ available in the console due to webpack
[15:07:29] <DevilTiger> i guess just put that in my js file
[15:07:41] <taplar> right, you have to do it in the script
[15:07:51] <taplar> doing it in the console is a different point in time in the program
[15:09:13] <DevilTiger> i don't understand how my selector is invalid
[15:09:20] <DevilTiger> the form id is myForm
[15:09:29] <DevilTiger> the selector i'm using is #myForm
[15:09:35] <taplar> right, change it to be that
[15:09:45] <DevilTiger> it is that
[15:10:04] <DevilTiger>   console.log($('#myForm').length);
[15:10:04] <DevilTiger>  returns 0
[15:10:09] <taplar> so it doesn't exist
[15:10:14] <DevilTiger> but it does. i'm looking at it
[15:10:17] <taplar> that's why your handler is not executing
[15:10:27] <taplar> it's not in the dom when that script runs
[15:10:30] <DevilTiger> why is it ignoring it when it's there? how do you debug that
[15:10:30] <taplar> that's what 0 means
[15:11:01] <taplar> the easiest way to fix this is to change it to be a delegate event handler
[15:11:12] <taplar> because the form does not exist yet, but it will later
[15:11:23] <DevilTiger> moving the function into my routers after() function returns 1 now
[15:11:31] <taplar> or that
[15:11:55] <DevilTiger> i don't really understand this stuff. if it was wrapped in document ready it should be there
[15:12:12] <taplar> all document ready does is waits for the html to be loaded into the dom
[15:12:19] <taplar> it does not wait on any dynamic content the javascript may create
[15:12:30] <DevilTiger> ok. that makes sense
[15:27:57] <Rockwood> https://jsfiddle.net/avfb5Lj4/1/  how to disappear after 5 seconds? bcz my js code is not working
[15:28:27] <taplar> use setTimeout
[15:29:12] <taplar> delay() is used to introduce delay between animations managed by jQuery.  if there are no animations, it does nothing
[15:29:27] <taplar> it's not intended to be a replacement for setTimeout
[15:29:49] <taplar> also your id in your fiddle doesn't match the id on the element
[15:30:38] <taplar> and message isn't defined, so I'm assuming you just provided part of your logic
[15:43:10] <DevilTiger> got my form firing. now i can't get the server to to accept it :P
[15:48:47] <robertmaxrees> oh boy
[15:49:23] <DevilTiger> might be getting somewhere though. just not sure how others that are using netlify are validating forms
[15:50:34] <Rockwood> its still not working https://jsfiddle.net/sftzu413/
[15:50:53] <robertmaxrees> Rockwood because doc$ isn't a thing
[15:51:14] <robertmaxrees> also you can't just randomly stick return false; anywhere.
[15:51:23] <robertmaxrees> and there's no ".previous" anywhere on that page.
[15:53:06] <robertmaxrees> Rockwood :)
[15:54:24] <Rockwood> https://jsfiddle.net/sy2vgamq/4/
[15:54:41] <robertmaxrees> yeah, so doc$ still isn't a thing.
[15:55:01] <robertmaxrees> turn doc$ into $ and it'll work.
[15:55:10] <robertmaxrees> you don't even need the doc ready for the fiddle.
[15:56:56] <Rockwood> i want to do on load
[15:56:57] <robertmaxrees> DevilTiger this system looks like it's just a deploy system?
[15:57:03] <robertmaxrees> Rockwood okie.
[15:57:31] <Rockwood> but its not working as expected
[15:57:34] <DevilTiger> yes. they handle server side processing of the forms. their documentation for JS forms isn't great though https://www.netlify.com/docs/form-handling/
[15:58:28] <DevilTiger> now instead of listening for the form submission i'm listening for the submit button click and preventing default on that and leaving their netlify tag in the form tag but i think their processing is grabbing it before JS can
[15:58:39] <DevilTiger> none of my console.logs on the onclick are firing
[15:59:33] <DevilTiger> this is a react sample for a file uploader but i don't see how mine differs / wouldn't work https://github.com/imorente/gatsby-netlify-form-example/blob/master/src/pages/file-upload.js
[15:59:53] <robertmaxrees> DevilTiger where's your code?
[16:00:19] <DevilTiger> do you want the full codebase or me to segment out stuff into a fiddle
[16:00:33] <robertmaxrees> just the specific bits you're having trouble with.
[16:00:35] <robertmaxrees> also https://www.netlify.com/docs/form-handling/#ajax-form-submissions
[16:00:57] <DevilTiger> right, i saw that. does that mean i need to remove the netlify from the form tag?
[16:01:11] <DevilTiger> really that's only a question they can answer and they refuse to
[16:01:27] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[16:01:40] <DevilTiger> read the top paragraph on that page
[16:01:53] <robertmaxrees> you mean the bit about the form-name?
[16:02:03] <Rockwood> thanks working now
[16:02:03] <DevilTiger> and adding netlify to the form tag, yes.
[16:02:26] <DevilTiger> "Code an HTML form into any page on your site, add a netlify attribute or data-netlify="true" to the <form> tag, and you can start receiving submissions in your Netlify site admin panel.
[16:02:26] <DevilTiger> "
[16:02:32] <robertmaxrees> DevilTiger that's specific to html forms.
[16:02:41] <robertmaxrees> that's probably related to their frontend js stuff.
[16:02:45] <robertmaxrees> you may not need it.
[16:02:55] <DevilTiger> well its not working without it
[16:03:07] <robertmaxrees> then include it :)
[16:03:13] <DevilTiger> but with it the javascript onclick doesnt work
[16:03:24] <robertmaxrees> onclick of what?
[16:03:27] <DevilTiger> err click(selector)
[16:03:32] <DevilTiger> of the submit button
[16:03:32] <robertmaxrees> don't you care about the form submit?
[16:03:37] <DevilTiger> tried that too
[16:03:38] <DevilTiger> didnt work
[16:03:48] <robertmaxrees> try a delegated handler?
[16:03:59] <DevilTiger> dont know what that is
[16:04:13] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events
[16:04:18] <robertmaxrees> http://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/
[16:04:55] <DevilTiger> i dont understand how this is appropriate
[16:05:18] <DevilTiger> you were just implying that listening to a click from the button isn't correct that i should be listening for the form submit
[16:05:32] <robertmaxrees> it seems like perhaps netlify might be doing something strange with the form client-side.
[16:05:36] <robertmaxrees> yes.
[16:05:42] <robertmaxrees> you want the form submit even.
[16:05:44] <robertmaxrees> *event
[16:05:48] <robertmaxrees> not the button click event.
[16:05:54] <robertmaxrees> what does that have to do wityh my suggestion?
[16:06:07] <DevilTiger> everything on those pages is listening for submit button events
[16:06:15] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[16:06:24] <DevilTiger> i don't know how to explain it differently
[16:06:31] <robertmaxrees> uh
[16:06:39] <robertmaxrees> lol
[16:06:46] <DevilTiger> maybe some context on how delegated events is relevant in this situation ?
[16:07:10] <robertmaxrees> i'd wonder if that system is rewriting or otherwise munging the markup in the client-side.
[16:07:22] <robertmaxrees> and so perhaps a delegated listener may work.
[16:07:25] <robertmaxrees> it's something to try.
[16:07:41] <DevilTiger> i dont understand what it is from reading the manual or how it pertains to form processing
[16:07:46] <Rockwood> robertmaxrees, 5000 === 5 seconds
[16:07:48] <Rockwood> ?
[16:07:56] <robertmaxrees> Rockwood i think so?
[16:08:06] <robertmaxrees> DevilTiger you said the handlers themselves aren't firing, correct?
[16:10:19] <robertmaxrees> #welp
[16:12:32] <robertmaxrees> bbiab
[16:14:01] <DevilTiger> if the netlify is in the form tag no. if not yes but the data doest get picked up by netlify
[16:15:34] <DevilTiger> theres this other article that says if you include the right content type header and point the POST anywhere in the sites path it'll go. but no go
[16:15:39] <DevilTiger> https://www.netlify.com/blog/2017/07/20/how-to-integrate-netlifys-form-handling-in-a-react-app/
[16:16:19] <DevilTiger> "Alternatively, if you’re using AJAX to submit the form, send a POST request to any path on your site. The request should include the header "Content-Type": "application/x-www-form-urlencoded", and the form-name attribute in the body. Make sure the attributes in the request body are URL-encoded to match the content-type"
[16:35:53] <DevilTiger> this shouldn't be this complicated lol
[17:07:54] <robertmaxrees> weeeee
[17:08:10] <taplar> you know it's a friday when an admin makes a server change that breaks production with out telling anyone
[17:08:34] <robertmaxrees> wait your admins actually do that??
[17:09:01] <taplar> they put in a setting to add Content-Security-Policy to our apps and set the value to 'self' only
[17:09:25] <taplar> cause our security department did a security scan and it was a problem that that's not set
[17:10:50] <robertmaxrees> oh.  yikes.
[17:10:53] <robertmaxrees> yeah, no.
[17:46:32] <taplar> good lord, i'm learning more about this than i care to
[17:46:51] <robertmaxrees> Hrm?
[17:47:05] <taplar> figuring out the settings that need to be there for this CSP setting
[17:47:36] <taplar> just had a pow wow with the admin going through the site finding the stuff that breaks
[17:47:49] <robertmaxrees> ah
[17:47:54] <taplar> default-src script-src style-src font-src connect-src
[17:47:55] <taplar> lol
[17:47:59] <taplar> so many settings....
[17:48:10] <robertmaxrees> yeah.....
[17:53:20] <taplar> do you know of any browser plugin that you can use to inject a header into request responses?
[17:55:36] <robertmaxrees> Can't think of any plugins.
[18:04:30] <Miles8of9> how can i apply some kind of $('.myClass').click(function (event) { ..... even to items added to the dom after the page has loaded.. ?
[18:05:46] <Miles8of9> i mean..... when page loads all items that have .myClass will trigger that event.. BUT not items added after
[18:07:46] <robertmaxrees> Miles8of9 event delegation!

[18:08:01] <robertmaxrees> http://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/
[18:19:19] <robertmaxrees> Miles8of9 that help?
[18:21:20] <Miles8of9> yes... i'm trying to update code...
[18:21:27] <Miles8of9> thanks
[18:21:52] <Miles8of9> jquery hates me so much -_-
[18:23:02] <robertmaxrees> ?
[18:27:33] <Miles8of9> $('#bookList').on('click', 'button', function (event) { .... });
[18:27:38] <Miles8of9>  is this correct?
[18:27:50] <robertmaxrees> does #bookListy exist on pageload?
[18:28:02] <robertmaxrees> *#bookList
[18:28:18] <Miles8of9> yes
[18:28:34] <robertmaxrees> and there's only 1 element with that ID?
[18:28:42] <Miles8of9> <ul id="booksList" class="list-unstyled">
[18:28:44] <Miles8of9> yes
[18:28:55] <robertmaxrees> I'd have to see it then.
[18:32:40] <Miles8of9> <button> elements are dynamically added inside <li>s
[18:32:56] <Miles8of9> i think it's the problem...  :|
[18:33:02] <robertmaxrees> nah.
[18:33:09] <robertmaxrees> buttons can be in LIs.
[18:33:21] <robertmaxrees> are you sure the UL exists by thge time you do the binding?
[18:33:42] <robertmaxrees> console.log($('#booksList').length); right before you try to bind that listener.
[18:36:07] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/ny3bwmuh/3/
[18:41:17] <Miles8of9> 0 wtf
[18:43:34] <Miles8of9> wrong id name
[18:50:38] <Miles8of9> ok it works now.. thanks
[18:54:05] <robertmaxrees> sure :)
[23:53:51] <Rockwood> https://jsfiddle.net/o9Ld0qnp/4/   why i am getting Uncaught TypeError: $(...).dialog is not a function ?
[23:56:21] <Rockwood> any active here ?
[23:56:50] <Robdgreat> !dataja
[23:56:54] <Robdgreat> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[23:57:33] <Robdgreat> Rockwood: if anyone were paying attention and had an answer to your question and were inclined to answer, they would have
[23:57:47] <Robdgreat> asking if anyone's active is just going to bait me into going on this pointless spiel
[23:58:18] <Rockwood> Robdgreat, i am looking for answer of my question nothing else
[23:58:32] <Robdgreat> then don't ask other questions
[23:59:06] <Rockwood> what mistake i am doing in declare .dialog function ?
[23:59:40] <Rockwood> it's not a function in jquery its mean
