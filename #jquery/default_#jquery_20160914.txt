[02:16:10] <VectorX> how can i change video_counter in  the onPlayerStateChange() function, trying to change the video and go thru the array of id's when the video ends http://jsfiddle.net/7Gznb/1822/
[04:47:19] <earational> hey
[07:20:26] <karstenk> Please can you have a look http://pastebin.com/x5LG9ANZ  I got the object every time, but I would like to get the return value of that method, which returns html.
[07:20:26] <karstenk>  its about jQuery.then()
[07:21:06] <Cork> karstenk: whats "model.call"?
[07:22:41] <karstenk> model is an instance to my python framework call calls object model in #openobject alias odoo framework
[07:23:01] <Cork> karstenk: you would have to look at what it does with the callback
[07:23:01] <karstenk> first param is the python method, second its args
[07:23:09] <Cork> cause return in the callback isn't to return from model.call
[07:23:18] <Cork> it is to return TO the model.call method
[07:27:40] <Cork> karstenk: that said, callbacks is usually used cause the call is async, and if that is the case you can't return out of them
[07:27:43] <karstenk> Cork https://github.com/odoo/odoo/blob/9.0/addons/web/static/src/js/framework/model.js#L44
[07:27:59] <Cork> ya, its an rpc call
[07:28:03] <Cork> you can't return from that
[07:28:54] <Cork> karstenk: code depending on the content inside the callback needs to be executed inside it (or at least called from inside it)
[07:29:02] <karstenk> but how to get the html which the method returns?
[07:29:09] <Cork> you can't
[07:29:19] <Cork> when the return happens the html isn't there yet
[07:29:29] <Cork> (that is what it means it is async)
[07:29:55] <karstenk> but i need, any idea?
[07:30:07] <Cork> you have to change how the code works
[07:30:10] <Cork> you can't do it
[07:30:38] <Cork> the reason it has to be async is else the browser would freeze while python does what ever it does
[07:30:58] <Cork> the callback solution continues to execute and returns to the browser
[07:31:06] <Cork> when python is done the callback is executed
[07:31:12] <Cork> and the browser executes the js function
[07:32:36] <karstenk> the main js class holds all methods for triggering events and push data through polling, there have to be a workaround or a better use of it
[07:33:05] <Cork> karstenk: ya, you have to change your code to work with callbacks instead of sync returns
[07:33:30] <Cork> cause you can't use returns without the code having to stop and wait for the rpc to get data back
[07:33:44] <Cork> (and i'm not even sure this api you have there supports that)
[07:34:05] <Cork> either way it is a very very bad coding pattern when the data is from third party
[07:34:20] <Cork> you should write it async
[07:38:23] <karstenk> https://www.odoo.com/documentation/9.0/howtos/web.html#communication-with-the-odoo-server
[07:38:34] <karstenk> perhaps i do not understand this
[07:39:18] <karstenk> ok, the result isnt returned, it is stored in an class attribute
[07:39:45] <Cork> not class attributwe
[07:39:56] <Cork> it is attached to an object given as this to the callback function
[07:44:48] <lodyb> can I use data stored in an attr and style with it? e.g. https://jsfiddle.net/9fqyppp2/
[07:46:57] <johnny__> please, help. I try submit form with click event from other click button
[07:47:17] <johnny__> anybody can help me?
[07:50:02] <lodyb> @lodyb solved my own query, just did a $('.elem').each() so that i get the $(this)
[07:50:56] <Cork> johnny__: you should use a submit button and bind submit on the form instead
[07:51:09] <Cork> don't bind click cause that will break the form for lots of cases
[07:51:40] <Cork> don't forget to execute event.preventDefault() if you want to prevent the form submission
[09:23:10] <arup_r> Hi.. How can I add a bit tweak here  $('.asset-row[data-type="1"]') this selected all row with data-type = 1 but I want all rows where data-type greater than 1
[09:23:14] <arup_r> how to do it?
[09:23:34] <daslicht> @lodyb : https://jsfiddle.net/daslicht/f6y8oLq1/1/
[09:23:36] <daslicht> ?
[09:23:47] <daslicht> ahh ok is see you solved it meanwhile :)
[09:25:10] <arup_r> help me please :)
[09:26:22] <Cork> arup_r: $('.asset-row[data-type]').filter(function() { return$(this).data('type') > 0 })
[09:26:32] <arup_r> Cork: ok thanks
[09:26:36] <arup_r> :)
[09:26:58] <Cork> but ya, add a class to those elements is what i would recommend
[09:27:40] <arup_r> Cork: I need Number() conversion now
[09:27:42] <arup_r> ?
[09:27:48] <arup_r> so I did like
[09:27:50] <Cork> no
[09:27:58] <arup_r> Number($(this).data('type')) > 0
[09:28:14] <arup_r> ok coercion happens here too? :)
[09:28:14] <Cork> also you don't want to use Number, it very new and slow
[09:28:28] <Cork> if you need to convert numbers use parseInt(string, 10)
[09:28:46] <Cork> (it is a magnitude faster then Number)
[09:28:53] <arup_r> JS coreced it .. '1' > 0 # true
[09:29:06] <Cork> ya, but .data does it too
[09:29:09] <arup_r> so let me rely on coercion
[09:29:12] <arup_r> ok I see
[09:29:12] <Cork> so it is already a number
[09:29:17] <arup_r> thanks again
[09:36:52] <decx> > 0 is superfluous
[09:37:43] <Ziberius> hello
[09:37:53] <Cork> it makes it clear what you expect the variable to hold though
[09:38:06] <Ziberius> is it possible to execute javascript in the hfref of <link href="" ></link>
[09:38:17] <Ziberius> i need to use a javascript variable
[09:38:21] <Cork> Ziberius: depends on if the page has cors or not
[09:38:27] <Ziberius> and so far nothing I've tried works
[09:38:31] <Ziberius> Cork: cors?
[09:38:38] <Cork> opps sorry csp
[09:38:46] <Cork> Content Security Policy
[09:39:09] <Cork> Ziberius: also it can only access global variables
[09:39:15] <Ziberius> Cork:  I see, but in case it doesn't how would you do it?
[09:39:34] <Ziberius> is it href="javascript: function()"?
[09:39:37] <Cork> wait...
[09:39:41] <Cork> href of link?!?
[09:39:48] <Ziberius> Cork: yes indeed
[09:39:51] <Cork> no link can't run scripts
[09:40:02] <Ziberius> Cork: i see, wll thanx
[09:40:26] <decx> write a new link tag
[09:40:42] <Cork> uh, if he want to run scripts he should create a script tag
[09:40:45] <Cork> not a link tag...
[09:40:55] <decx> well we can only assume
[09:41:09] <Cork> he wants to run javascript...
[09:41:11] <decx> i'm thinking of having a clientside string, and that string is used to load a stylesheet
[09:41:28] <decx> ie $('<link>').prop('href', string)
[09:41:32] <Ziberius> decx: howd o you mean a new link tag
[09:41:55] <Ziberius> oh
[09:47:06] <Ziberius> guess I'll just leave all my php files in the same directory
[09:47:24] <Ziberius> wanted to use dynamic urls in my link href but wth
[09:47:52] <decx> what does that even mean
[09:48:15] <decx> you want to add ../../ by javascript?
[09:48:23] <pihpah___> $('video').one('playing', function() {}); does not receives the event once video is being played, what might be wrong?
[09:48:41] <pihpah___> Firefox
[09:51:32] <decx> works fine for me
[10:01:44] <arup___> Hi .. how can I check if the dom $('.shareable') is empty or not?
[10:12:45] <arup___> ok nvm got it.
[10:13:01] <arup___> how do you remove blank lines from a dom?
[10:15:12] <arup___> for me $('.shareable') is empty, but I see $('.shareable').is(':empty') return false because it has some empty text
[10:16:50] <arc_> https://jsfiddle.net/9Lagjpoc/
[10:25:30] <arup___> @arc_ yes in first case also I want true
[10:25:45] <arup___> somehow. I am trying some code to figure out
[10:27:10] <arc_> okay, well you didn't ask for a different version of :empty you just asked how to ensure it's empty
[10:31:51] <arup___> that is may be bad english
[10:32:02] <arup___> from my side
[10:32:08] <arup___> -_-
[10:32:44] <decx> instead of is(':empty:) use .html().trim().length
[10:33:10] <arc_> good point
[10:41:49] <arup___> decx: yup!
[10:41:52] <arup___> thanks
[10:44:03] <arup___> arc_: and decx I wrote it like   shareable_empty = $('.shareable').filter(() -> $(this).is(':empty') ).length == 0  any bug could arise?
[10:49:58] <z1haze_work> how can i determine which submit button was clicked in the on submit handler?
[10:50:56] <arup___> use a class
[10:51:05] <arup___> and read it then
[10:51:16] <z1haze_work> huh
[10:51:59] <arup___> why, is is a shit idea? ðŸ˜‚
[10:52:26] <z1haze_work> just not following, might not be shit
[10:52:53] <arup___> ok so you have a set of buttons and u want to check which one click right?
[10:53:06] <z1haze_work> in the submit handler, yes
[10:53:17] <arup___> so each button if have a class="foo" another another has class="bar"
[10:53:30] <arup___> so inside the submit handler you can read the class and confirmed
[10:54:07] <z1haze_work> :)
[10:54:18] <z1haze_work> if i coudl read the class id know which button was clicked..
[10:54:45] <z1haze_work> i need to get the button that was clicked to submit the form, in the submit handler
[10:55:36] <z1haze_work> actually just figured it out, see if you can get it! it was kinda tricky
[10:56:52] <z1haze_work> agh it doesnt worked unless you click it though
[11:12:09] <z1haze_work> so - our onepage checkout is apparently all setup with click event and stuff that handles everything.. i guess no one thought about the enter key
[11:13:35] <z1haze_work> we were using the click event to determine which form action to take on the back end.. and when a user just hits enter to submit the form nothing, none of that action takes place, and shit breaks.. any thoughts on how id go about fixing this - i somehow need to obtain the intended action the form shoudl take even if it isnt clicked
[11:44:34] <taplar> z1haze_work: typically how we resolve that issue is to put a class on the default action of the form
[11:44:45] <taplar> like "primary" or something
[11:45:10] <taplar> then bind a event handler for keydown on the inputs and if it's enter, cancel the event, find the element with that class, and trigger it
[11:45:37] <taplar> otherwise you could always have the form action already be the default
[11:45:47] <z1haze_work> the way the backend for our system requires the submitted buttons name to be submitted at the end of the query string, typically with you click the submit button, its the last element in the form so it works fine
[11:46:11] <taplar> right with the primary class option that would work
[11:46:36] <taplar> cause you'd be trigger('click') on the button with the primary class
[11:46:36] <z1haze_work> its like a matrix kinda. there is a node the page stops on when several 'directions' the route can take.. the platform searchs for a specific parameter thats passed in to tell it which route to take
[11:46:57] <z1haze_work> right, but when user just hits enter, we dont know which action it was supposed to take
[11:47:13] <taplar> which is why you have the keydown binding i mentioned
[11:47:15] <z1haze_work> i figured it out by just forcing it a default route for now until we get a better solution
[11:47:30] <z1haze_work> right, keydown, still doesnt get me which button needs to be passed
[11:47:41] <taplar> are you not reading what i typed?
[11:47:55] <z1haze_work> im readin man, we just arent seeing it the same
[11:48:15] <z1haze_work> if i have a form with 2 type=submit buttons in it.. if a user just presses enter, how do i know which button to submit with
[11:48:15] <taplar> primary class on the default action.  bind on keydown for the inputs.  if enter, cancel the event, and trigger click on the button with the primary class
[11:48:22] <taplar> they primary class
[11:48:26] <taplar> *the
[11:49:03] <z1haze_work> there is not real default action
[11:49:22] <z1haze_work> my previous message explains it in the easiest way i can
[11:49:29] <z1haze_work> single form, multiple buttons with type=submit
[11:49:38] <taplar> so if they hit enter, what action is supossed to happen?
[11:49:42] <z1haze_work> pressing enter on the keyboard, even if you were to trigger a click, how do you know which button to trigger
[11:49:46] <z1haze_work> exactly
[11:49:52] <z1haze_work> thats the problem
[11:49:52] <taplar> that's a business question
[11:49:57] <taplar> not a logic question
[11:49:59] <z1haze_work> whoever wrote this shit only binded it to click events
[11:50:24] <taplar> ask your business, if this happens, what should happen.
[11:50:28] <z1haze_work> i know there isnt a coding answer to this once i asked it
[11:51:02] <z1haze_work> i had a ticket to fix something in this file, which is when i discovered this other issue.
[11:51:08] <z1haze_work> tested it in production and sure enough it breaks
[11:51:31] <taplar> lol, at the least you could prevent enter on inputs, but they may not like that
[11:51:58] <taplar> all up to them at this point for what they want
[11:52:06] <z1haze_work> you mean prevent default on the form submit?
[11:52:10] <z1haze_work> on keypress anyway
[11:52:14] <taplar> keydown on inputs, if enter
[11:52:17] <z1haze_work> yea
[11:52:24] <z1haze_work> bandaid at least
[11:52:43] <z1haze_work> im really trying to get my team to adopt a sot of framework
[11:52:49] <taplar> but make sure they are ok with that.  don't want to just do it, and then they get complaints and ask why you did it
[11:53:18] <z1haze_work> yea, well for now i just have a fake default route that it hits if all else fails
[11:53:59] <z1haze_work> its nota huge deal really, its like if you are signed into the site, during a checkout process, if you were to go back and edit one of your addresses, and hit continue it didnt know which route to go
[11:54:08] <z1haze_work> so now i just force it to save your address everytime, oh well
[11:56:05] <MikeD_> where do i find the implementation of .autocomplete() before it's minified?
[11:58:33] <taplar> uh, maybe there is a git repo?
[12:00:41] <taplar> or browse a hosted cdn version: https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jqueryui/1.12.0/jquery-ui.js
[12:02:33] <MikeD_> thanks, that looks like what i wanted
[12:02:44] <taplar> cooleo
[12:03:23] <MikeD_> i'm trying to figure out why the first click to select fires the function assigned in the .autocomplete() option, but after the first time it stops firing the autocompleteselect method
[12:03:34] <MikeD_> s/method/event
[12:03:34] <b-ot> Correction, <MikeD_> i'm trying to figure out why the first click to select fires the function assigned in the .autocomplete() option, but after the first time it stops firing the autocompleteselect event
[12:04:01] <MikeD_> wow, that's unnecessary but cool
[12:04:43] <taplar> you mean you change the value, select a new value and the autocompleteselect doesn't fire again?
[12:05:52] <MikeD_> correct
[12:10:16] <DelphiWorld> hi jQueryers
[12:10:23] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/ar6dsjgL/ seems to work
[12:10:42] <DelphiWorld> any easy way to consume a restFul api with jq?
[12:11:16] <taplar> consume?
[12:11:27] <robertmaxrees> DelphiWorld sure - just so long as the API allows CORS.
[12:11:52] <DelphiWorld> robertmaxrees: hold on ;)
[12:12:17] <DelphiWorld> robertmaxrees: the example here is in php but i want to consume it using jQuery & html form: https://documentation.onesignal.com/v2.0/docs/notifications-create-notification
[12:12:47] <taplar> servers consume rest requests...
[12:12:58] <taplar> not clients, :/
[12:13:12] <robertmaxrees> taplar lots of people misapply the term "Consume" :)
[12:13:18] <DelphiWorld> lol
[12:13:30] <robertmaxrees> DelphiWorld doesn't look like this supports client-side.
[12:13:33] <robertmaxrees> so you're basically sol.
[12:13:35] <DelphiWorld> this is a push notification and i want to input in form & submit ;)
[12:13:59] <DelphiWorld> ok, so must be done in php...
[12:14:01] <taplar> oh, like using postMessage?
[12:14:07] <robertmaxrees> server-side in general, yeah.
[12:14:08] <DelphiWorld> taplar: yes its post
[12:14:32] <DelphiWorld> i thought its a small work so could be easyly done using jquery
[12:14:39] <DelphiWorld> i got it to run using Curl
[12:15:06] <robertmaxrees> right.
[12:15:10] <robertmaxrees> because that's server-side.
[12:15:29] <DelphiWorld> so what could be the diference robertmaxrees ?
[12:15:36] <DelphiWorld> just to understand it clearly
[12:15:41] <robertmaxrees> CORS
[12:15:48] <DelphiWorld> got it
[12:18:26] <decx> just have your own server proxy that curl
[12:18:42] <DelphiWorld> decx: suggest ?
[12:18:49] <decx> yes
[12:19:17] <DelphiWorld> there's ready to use proxys?
[12:19:25] <robertmaxrees> he said have your own do it.
[12:19:36] <DelphiWorld> ah
[12:19:41] <decx> you just proxy the json
[12:19:53] <decx> and maybe cache
[12:20:11] <decx> and take out stuff you dont want
[12:20:19] <decx> overfetching is the unword of the year
[12:20:47] <DelphiWorld> just i'm not every day in development so i'm not realy up to date
[12:21:24] <decx> we're all winging it, dive in
[12:21:32] <robertmaxrees> ^^^
[12:21:35] <DelphiWorld> hahaha thanks decx
[12:22:34] <taplar> i was kinda thinking about that yesterday, after watching some cpan thing.  people claiming to be it experts, or saying they were not it experts
[12:22:46] <taplar> IT is a pretty broad topic.  dunno how anyone would be an expert
[12:22:53] <robertmaxrees> right?
[12:23:27] <decx> it's not IT it's it
[12:23:31] <decx> what's it you ask?
[12:23:33] <decx> it!
[12:23:36] <taplar> lol
[12:23:57] <decx> i used to be with it
[12:24:03] <decx> then they cahnged what it was
[12:24:10] <decx> now what's it scares and frightens me
[12:24:16] <decx> it'll happen to youuuuu
[12:24:19] <MikeD_> grandpa simpson
[12:24:20] <DelphiWorld> lol
[12:24:28] <taplar> it's being a pain in my azz today
[12:25:45] <taplar> i just want it to work
[12:30:50] <taplar> AwkwardCough: help me!!!!
[12:31:28] <MikeD_> who is AwkwardCough and why would her or she help?  ;)
[12:31:38] <taplar> i work with them
[12:31:46] <MikeD_> ah, nice nick
[12:31:48] <taplar> just bugging them, :)
[12:39:35] <taplar> score!

[12:46:47] <taplar> my server stopped crashing.  you can't bring me down!
[12:49:24] <shoky> anyone know a nice plugin for tags/tokens input, with autocomplete, that allows user to enter arbitrary tags, and doesn't require bootstrap or react?
[12:49:24] <AwkwardCough> whaaa
[12:49:48] <taplar> AwkwardCough: latest intellij was being an azz to me
[12:50:00] <AwkwardCough> what version were you on?
[12:50:06] <AwkwardCough> the beta one?
[12:50:14] <taplar> *.2.4
[12:51:12] <AwkwardCough> did you end up reverting?
[12:51:35] <taplar> no, restarted the box and let it do a clean.  seems fine now
[12:51:46] <AwkwardCough> huh... go figure
[12:55:02] <shoky> nevermind, totally forgot about this one  http://selectize.github.io/selectize.js/
[13:19:14] <ZoiX> Hello there, I am trying to use the carousel from materializecss.com, but "set" method doesn't seem to work. Every other methods (like next or prev) are working, but not the 'set' method: http://materializecss.com/carousel.html
[13:19:27] <ZoiX> Is just me?
[13:21:21] <luound> how can I implement wow.js animation only after the page has loaded?
[13:26:12] <taplar> what are you referring to as 'loaded' ?
[13:27:20] <luound> on window.load
[13:27:25] <robertmaxrees> having quite a few drinks on a saturday night
[13:27:45] <taplar> $(document).on('load', function(){ .... });
[13:27:55] <luound> lol that I know
[13:28:09] <taplar> so elaborate on your question?
[13:28:12] <luound> am using animate.css and wow.js to do an animation on a caption over an image, but it animates even before the image has loaded
[13:28:22] <robertmaxrees> actually you want $(window).load()
[13:28:27] <luound> yea I know
[13:28:28] <taplar> images have load events too
[13:28:38] <robertmaxrees> just gotta bind before the image loads.
[13:28:48] <luound> have you tried animate.css and wow.js?
[13:29:16] <luound> or used
[13:29:59] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[13:30:09] <luound> then why are you guessing :/
[13:30:14] <robertmaxrees> i'm not.
[13:30:19] <robertmaxrees> i know how images work.
[13:30:32] <taplar> not personally.  though there are lots of things i haven't used. doesn't mean we can't understand concepts
[13:30:36] <luound> yes but my question is not that
[13:31:11] <robertmaxrees> alright well if we want to be pedantic and overly specific about things: http://irc.jquery.org/irc-help/#asking-good-questions
[13:31:15] <taplar> you are wanting to animate after window load, but $(window).load() isn't working for you?
[13:31:17] <robertmaxrees> go ahead and make a reduced test case :)
[13:31:40] <luound> I already asked the question above..so if you have no idea about wow.js, you shouldn't shoot random answers
[13:31:43] <taplar> you've stated what you want, sorta, but not what the issue is
[13:31:59] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:32:05] <robertmaxrees> this channel
[13:32:07] <taplar> hokay, take care
[13:32:31] <luound> I wouldnt fly a plane if I have played flight simulator game
[13:32:40] <robertmaxrees> that's enough.
[13:32:54] <robertmaxrees> either make a test case or head elsewhere for support :)  thanks!
[13:33:07] <luound> no worries
[13:33:19] <luound> you don't have to tell me what to do anyways
[14:03:46] <taplar> fun with buffers
[14:18:00] <catbadger> fun with buffout
[14:23:11] <taplar> lol, huh?
[14:37:34] <test_test_> hi
[14:37:45] <taplar> aloha
[14:37:51] <test_test_> isn't there a way to do a simple combobox with autocompletion ?
[14:37:56] <test_test_> all I find is this :
[14:38:10] <test_test_> https://jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#combobox
[14:38:24] <test_test_> and it seems to need a ton of code
[14:38:38] <test_test_> IIRC, there was a way to do like :
[14:39:20] <test_test_> $('#myselector', { method: 'GET', url: 'http://bla.com/data?query=', otherOptions});
[14:39:35] <taplar> what is a 'combobox' ?
[14:39:45] <test_test_> like a select list but with autocompletion
[14:40:05] <taplar> oh, well, one sec
[14:40:28] <test_test_> $('#myselector', { method: 'GET', url: 'http://bla.com/data?query=', otherOptions}).combobox();
[14:40:36] <test_test_> forgot the .combobox()
[14:40:54] <decx> only makes sense if you already use jqui
[14:41:00] <test_test_> I do
[14:41:17] <decx> well then
[14:41:50] <taplar> i'm forgetting it, but there is a way to have a group of options and associate it with a text field
[14:42:26] <taplar> maybe optgroup but i'm blanking
[14:43:01] <taplar> no that's not it
[14:43:13] <taplar> datalist
[14:43:21] <test_test_> datalist ?
[14:43:36] <taplar> http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml5_datalist
[14:43:52] <taplar> please ignore that i'm linking to w3schools, :)
[14:44:28] <decx> yuk
[14:44:41] <decx> is that for the dropdown that looks like past searches in this field
[14:44:48] <decx> i dont want to click ^^
[14:45:02] <taplar> it's like a dummy autocomplete
[14:45:14] <taplar> you can have a datalist related to many text fields
[14:45:29] <taplar> instead of duplicating it
[14:45:51] <test_test_> I must be dumb but where's the code ?
[14:46:02] <test_test_> I only see output
[14:46:08] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/xy8uy0ze/
[14:46:15] <taplar> there is no code.  it's all your browser
[14:47:20] <test_test_> :o
[14:47:22] <test_test_> wow
[14:47:27] <test_test_> is that recent ?
[14:47:35] <test_test_> like new W3C standard ?
[14:47:39] <taplar> newish
[14:48:00] <test_test_> well you at least partially saved my day taplar :) thanks
[14:50:06] <taplar> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/datalist has the compatibility table
[14:54:56] <taplar> lol, i just realized that example from w3c doesn't have closing tags on the options, *shakes his head*
[14:56:25] <taplar> huh, so does mdn
[14:59:14] <decx> not required
[14:59:27] <decx> just means you can  separate chose value from displayed text
[14:59:31] <decx> can't
[15:00:30] <taplar> but is it a case that you shouldn't put it, or just the normal your browser is protecting you from some markup mistakes?
[15:04:50] <Nuts_> Hi guys, i'm trying to order encstock array with sub_id on encopt array but only when the subid exists in the encopt, when it doesn't exist it should keep the normal order. https://jsfiddle.net/rkfwf2f5/1/
[15:06:51] <taplar> stock amount highest to lowest?
[15:08:26] <Nuts_> no stock depending on the order encopt is
[15:08:33] <taplar> and this is more of a ##javascript question
[15:09:06] <Nuts_> didn't know
[15:09:12] <Nuts_> i apologise
[15:09:30] <taplar> np.  it's just going to involve a use of sort() on the array, so all of it is javascript, not jquery
[15:09:42] <Nuts_> ok i'll try there, thanks
[15:21:50] <Parzival_> I am trying to build a script for repetitive task at work, very new to JavaScript. For outputing to a text field in html could i use document.getElementByID("elementID").write(content);?
[15:23:32] <taplar> newer browser?
[15:23:55] <Parzival_> chrome
[15:24:26] <taplar> 'text field', <textarea> or <input> ?
[15:25:25] <Parzival_> text area
[15:25:52] <taplar> document.querySelector('#theId').innerHTML += content;
[15:26:31] <taplar> that's also more of a ##javascript question, ;)
[15:27:39] <Parzival_> oh ok.. ty for pointing me in the right direction and the help!
[15:27:48] <taplar> np
[16:21:00] <NomadJim> if I have a jquery button in one div and I want to move it to another div, is it just setting the button to some javascript var, removing it from one div and appending it to the other?
[16:21:21] <taplar> you can just append it to the new guy
[16:21:31] <NomadJim> ty
[16:21:52] <taplar> dom elements can't have multiple parents, so it detaches as part of it's normal logic
[16:22:04] <taplar> (direct) parents
[16:23:54] <NomadJim> nice
[16:24:19] <robertmaxrees> unf
[16:28:51] <NomadJim> if I want to append it to the the div child of a div with id='column' is it $("#movingButton").appendTo("#column div")
[16:29:03] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[16:29:06] <NomadJim> ty
[16:29:21] <robertmaxrees> fwiw - why "move" the button?
[16:29:24] <robertmaxrees> why not hide/show things.
[16:30:34] <taplar> you'd also want to assure that there was only one div under the #column, otherwise it would be appended to the last one
[16:30:40] <robertmaxrees> ^
[16:34:56] <NomadJim> robertmaxrees:  i was showing and hiding things, but this button is moving in location
[16:35:12] <robertmaxrees> right, why not just hide/show the button in various places?
[16:35:17] <robertmaxrees> it'll save you headaches.
[16:35:27] <NomadJim> because I have a lot of code that references the button
[16:35:39] <robertmaxrees> lol
[16:35:41] <robertmaxrees> 'kay
[16:35:41] <NomadJim> so I'd have to have 2 of the same button, and keep the select value in sync
[16:36:04] <NomadJim> so instead of keeping it in sync between the two I'm just gonna move it
[16:36:08] * taplar is lost
[16:36:16] <robertmaxrees> welp
[16:36:18] <taplar> what's a button got to do with a select value?
[16:36:36] <NomadJim> it's a drop down select in my app
[16:36:43] <NomadJim> i just used button as a simple example
[16:38:04] <NomadJim> it's the change download on the right - http://i.imgur.com/ZcGlIx4.png
[16:38:38] <robertmaxrees> let me guess: you have multiple instances of that button that you need to allow do the same thing?
[16:41:08] <NomadJim> I didn't instance it, saw that while doing google fu
[16:41:37] <NomadJim> just moving it atm
[16:41:50] <taplar> what will it look like after you move it?
[16:44:04] <NomadJim> taplar:  http://i.imgur.com/jPmAIV2.png
[16:44:43] <NomadJim> originally it was just in the bottom frame, now I'm creating it on the top and moving it to the bottom frame
[16:45:18] <taplar> and you can only see one of those blocks at a time?
[16:46:32] <NomadJim> yup
[16:47:27] <taplar> I'm kinda curious why you wouldn't have just a generic "change race" or something, since you have both a change speed and change download option, both pre-existing in the first block
[16:48:04] <taplar> or "New Race"
[16:48:19] <taplar> something that just takes them back to the first one and they can change either at their leasure
[16:48:38] <taplar> just me rambling
[16:50:31] <NomadJim> Change Speed takes them back to the top frame
[16:50:52] <NomadJim> Selecting a different file download just reruns the race inside the 2nd frame
[16:52:04] <NomadJim> I think they just want to have the user engaged with thinking about download speed as much as possible
[16:53:32] * taplar holds back more critique
[16:55:40] <nexus2911> Hello, have an accordion, need to abide by current html and css structure.  I have it working to a point, need other panels to collapse when one panel is open:
[16:55:43] <nexus2911> https://jsfiddle.net/Lbvx0wfs/
[16:57:47] <nexus2911> not allowing myself to use an existing accordioin code, need to do this from documentation as much as possible
[16:57:51] <taplar> you'd want to close the others when you open one, but to do that you'll probably want to change your logic up from being toggles
[16:58:18] <nexus2911> taplar: ok, been messing with that too, but had issues
[16:58:33] <taplar> can you show what you tried?
[16:58:43] <nexus2911> https://jsfiddle.net/Lbvx0wfs/
[16:58:50] <nexus2911> oh, what i tried...
[16:58:54] <taplar> ya
[16:58:56] <nexus2911> slideUp
[16:59:28] <nexus2911> but seemed to cause other issues, ie, animation firing twice, and no, e.propogation didn't work
[16:59:44] <nexus2911> e.stopPropagation() i meant
[17:00:24] <taplar> are you familiar with delegate bindings?
[17:00:35] <nexus2911> also, a pram that would allow single open (as requested) or others remaining open would be nice
[17:01:19] <nexus2911> no, not familiar
[17:01:30] <taplar> k, one sec
[17:03:41] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/Lbvx0wfs/1/ <-- towards the bottom
[17:07:47] <nexus2911> thank you.
[17:08:22] <taplar> have an idea what it's doing?
[17:08:34] <nexus2911> hold please...
[17:09:18] <nexus2911> taplar: I tried adding  $(this).children(".accordion ul").show();
[17:09:27] <nexus2911> and  $(this).children(".accordion ul").hide();
[17:09:34] <taplar> the 'this' in that case would be the heading tag
[17:09:40] <taplar> which is a child of accordion
[17:10:51] <nexus2911> trying to work my code into your functions
[17:11:38] <nexus2911> the panels show, but need others to hide
[17:12:07] <nexus2911> ie, cars panel needs to hide upon click on Trucks heading
[17:12:47] <taplar> do you have the expanding and collapsing of a single heading working?
[17:12:59] <nexus2911> with your code, they only expand
[17:13:07] <taplar> get the collapsing working too
[17:13:23] <nexus2911> i had that working with toggle
[17:13:27] <taplar> small steps, :)
[17:13:39] <taplar> avoid toggle, you want to be explicit
[17:14:26] <nexus2911> how do I use show(), then hide on second click?
[17:14:26] <taplar> it's going to help you modularize your logic
[17:14:43] <taplar> ok, so let me go over the functions
[17:14:59] <taplar> those two bindings are delegate bindings.  notice that both are bound to the $accordion?
[17:15:07] <nexus2911> yes
[17:15:16] <taplar> that is the parent of all of your elements
[17:15:28] <taplar> a delegate binding is placed on a parent and listens for events from children elements
[17:15:28] <nexus2911> correct
[17:15:44] <taplar> the second parameter to the binding is the filter for the binding
[17:15:55] <taplar> it matches against the events that bubble up
[17:16:04] <nexus2911> in this case, children that receive events are headings
[17:16:11] <taplar> notice both are checking for different states of the 'active' class being there or not
[17:17:02] <taplar> so if the active class is there, the bottom one will execute, not the first
[17:17:06] <taplar> and vise versa if it is not there
[17:18:03] <nexus2911> how did the active class get there?  your talking from my $$(this).toggleClass("active") correct?
[17:18:25] <taplar> you'll have to add and remove that in each case
[17:18:27] <nexus2911> or is it something internal to jQuery
[17:18:51] <taplar> addClass('active') in the show logic, removeClass('active') in the hide logic
[17:20:03] <nexus2911> add the class to your $thisHeading var, correct?
[17:20:17] <taplar> yep
[17:20:36] <taplar> that's $(this) which is the heading as per the filter selector on the binding
[17:20:37] <nexus2911> so what about show/hide?
[17:21:23] <taplar> your wanting to show/hide the child ul inside the heading, right?
[17:21:30] <nexus2911> yes
[17:21:39] <taplar> $theHeading is the heading, right?
[17:21:55] <taplar> (not a trick question)
[17:22:26] <nexus2911> yes
[17:22:39] <taplar> so find your child ul and show/hide it
[17:22:43] <nexus2911> right
[17:23:04] <nexus2911> question, why do you start your var with a $?
[17:23:22] <taplar> it denotes the value stored in it should already be a jQuery object
[17:23:32] <taplar> so later i know i don't have to do $(theHeader)
[17:23:36] <taplar> which wouldn't do anything
[17:24:07] <nexus2911> I've got $($thisHeading).addClass("active").
[17:24:10] <nexus2911> that part works
[17:24:12] <taplar> yep
[17:24:19] <taplar> uh, don't wrap it
[17:24:23] <robertmaxrees> no need to do $($thisHEading)
[17:24:26] <taplar> just $thisHeading.addClass...
[17:24:31] <robertmaxrees> ^^^
[17:24:34] <taplar> just said why, ;)
[17:24:38] <nexus2911> oh ok
[17:26:05] <nexus2911> that syntax is throwing me, when I need to add the other elements to it in order to show/hide
[17:26:14] <taplar> which syntax?
[17:26:18] <nexus2911> $thisHeading
[17:26:29] <nexus2911> all in quotes when adding the other elements?
[17:26:33] <nexus2911> example:
[17:26:45] <nexus2911> "$thisHeading .accordion ul"
[17:26:51] <taplar> no no
[17:27:06] <nexus2911> "$thisHeading .accordion ul".show()
[17:27:08] <taplar> ok, so $thisHeading is a jquery object, right?
[17:27:11] <nexus2911> right
[17:27:20] <taplar> so it has all the normal methods jquery objects have
[17:27:34] <taplar> you just do $thisHeading.addClass(...)
[17:27:37] <taplar> or whatever
[17:27:44] <taplar> $thisHeading.find(....)
[17:27:48] <nexus2911> right, I got that.  I'm talking about the lements to show hide
[17:27:58] <taplar> right, you find the child elements
[17:28:17] <taplar> $thisHeading.find('childElementSelector')
[17:29:03] <taplar> since your operating off of $thisHeading, that's the context in which it will search.  it does not need to be apart of the selector
[17:29:25] <taplar> $(selector) is essentially $(document).find(selector)
[17:30:10] <nexus2911> $thisHeading.find(".accordion ul").show();
[17:30:15] <nexus2911> not working
[17:30:17] <taplar> right
[17:30:22] <taplar> what is thisHeading?
[17:31:11] <nexus2911> well i thought that was the parent element of the child we are trying to show
[17:31:17] <taplar> right, the heading
[17:31:31] <taplar> what is a heading's relationship to 'accordion'?
[17:31:40] <nexus2911> its a child
[17:31:55] <taplar> ok, so with that in mind, look at your find selector
[17:32:17] <taplar> find() looks for children
[17:33:08] <taplar> accordion isn't a child of the heading is it?
[17:33:14] <nexus2911> no
[17:33:18] <taplar> so...
[17:33:30] <nexus2911> remove according and look for ul
[17:33:35] <taplar> yup
[17:34:11] <nexus2911> Ok, great, thank you.  expand/collapse on heading click working
[17:34:26] <nexus2911> now, other panel needs to hide if other panel is showning
[17:34:28] <nexus2911> showing
[17:34:38] <taplar> can you update the fiddle and share it?
[17:35:22] <nexus2911> https://jsfiddle.net/Lbvx0wfs/2/
[17:36:06] <taplar> alright, so, let me make one small change
[17:38:07] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/Lbvx0wfs/3/
[17:39:07] <taplar> so the collapse calls a method that takes the element and collapses it
[17:39:54] <taplar> what this allows you to do is, in the expand logic, if you can find all the other headings, other than the one you are expanding, then you could pass them into that method and it will collapse them for you
[17:41:46] <taplar> actually if you wanted to reduce the logic you could give all the headings to that function first in your expand, and then do the expand
[17:41:55] <taplar> no harm in trying to close something that's already closed
[17:44:01] <nexus2911> taplar: bear with me, you've been patient, appreciate it
[17:44:14] <nexus2911> taplar: here's what I have now
[17:45:02] <nexus2911> taplar: https://jsfiddle.net/Lbvx0wfs/4/
[17:45:38] <nexus2911> taplar: how do I pass in to that function the other panel that is open in order to have it close when the ohter header is clicked
[17:45:55] <luound> wasup
[17:46:04] <taplar> ok, in the collapse you don't have to do anything other than call that method
[17:46:11] <taplar> it's already doing all the collapse logic for you
[17:46:44] <taplar> in the expand logic, you just need to find all the headings in the accordion and give them to that function
[17:48:10] <nexus2911> taplar: I could use help there
[17:48:23] <nexus2911> pseudo:
[17:49:06] <NomadJim> how do you guys test your jquery apps that have different states and need to be tested at different resolutions?
[17:49:14] <taplar> find all headings in accordion; collapseHeadings($allHeadings); do expand logic for single heading;
[17:49:25] <NomadJim> I need a combination of browsershots + Selenium
[17:49:38] <robertmaxrees> NomadJim should be able to use selenium to do all that.
[17:49:56] <taplar> we use Gauge, which uses sahi/selenium, for functional tests and jasmine for unit tests
[17:50:04] <NomadJim> roger
[17:51:08] <taplar> i really wish we used Geb, but not my decision
[17:53:29] <taplar> i'm just a grunt, :D
[17:53:29] <NomadJim> Selenium, Gauge, Geb, Sahi
[17:53:43] <NomadJim> Don't have time to build it out this time but I'll look into those thx
[17:53:50] <taplar> Geb is unique to groovy/grails, so you may can strike that out
[18:00:10] <taplar> awww, nex left
[19:00:20] <nexus2911> taplar: hello
[19:02:32] <taplar> hey!
[19:02:59] <nexus2911> taplar: I could still use your help if you're available
[19:04:12] <nexus2911> taplar: https://jsfiddle.net/Lbvx0wfs/4/
[19:04:35] <nexus2911> you'll see in the commented out code in the expand function where i tried to find the other open panel and have it collapse
[19:06:21] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/Lbvx0wfs/5/
[19:06:26] <catbadger> what's up?
[19:06:59] <taplar> so the bit about collapsing all of them is what is left
[19:07:14] <taplar> see what you can come up with
[19:11:06] <nexus2911> taplar: got it!
[19:11:19] <taplar> :)
[19:11:26] <nexus2911>  var $allHeadings = $('.heading.active');
[19:11:46] <nexus2911> taplar: do you have a "buy me coffee" link?
[19:11:55] <nexus2911> taplar: because I surely would donate
[19:12:16] <taplar> nah, it's all good.  the whole purpose of the room, ;)
[19:12:26] <nexus2911> taplar: much appreciated sir!
[19:12:47] <taplar> oh, wait
[19:12:59] <taplar> well, your doing that inside the expand logic?
[19:13:28] <nexus2911> yes, and it works
[19:13:39] <taplar> yah, cool
[19:14:10] <nexus2911> they wanted a param that would either collapse the other panels when another was opened or keep them opend
[19:14:20] <nexus2911> just comment out that collapse code and the others will stay open
[19:14:58] <taplar> sure
[19:18:08] <nexus2911> taplar: again, much appreciated
[21:39:39] <takelong> in   $.plot($('.chart-placeholder.import-results'),  theres Uncaught TypeError: $.plot is not a function
[21:40:01] <takelong> is it something from the jQuery core?
[23:52:37] <Alturic> hey guys, I have 2 .getJSON inside a select.change, if I wanted to see if both the JSON objects are empty, what would be the best approach?
