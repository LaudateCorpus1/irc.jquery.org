[00:00:58] <chinoto> hmm, I need to formulate a grep...
[00:06:03] <jonathancutrell> Hey folks
[00:06:30] <jonathancutrell> Has anyone in here messed around with the Rdio API? I'm looking for some info on the new JS api. Here's a working example:
[00:06:31] <jonathancutrell> https://github.com/rdio/jsapi-examples/tree/master/simple-player
[00:07:09] <jonathancutrell> I'm trying to figure out exactly where the client_id parameter is coming from - my app ID doesn't work as the parameter. I know it's a shot in the dark, but you never know.
[00:08:53] <tw2113> where are you seeing client_id ?
[00:09:06] <tw2113>  <script src="https://rdio.com/api/api.js?client_id=ppJo1acOvcWl8ZlpTnXUkA"></script> ?
[00:11:13] <chinoto> so that's what it was, not php or javascript, it was bash that would not removed backslashes if they weren't followed by something that that creates an escape sequence
[00:11:59] <jonathancutrell> tw2113: Correct
[00:12:41] <jonathancutrell> tw2113: which I'm assuming is generated by some other process, but the documentation apparently isn't up to date with these new demos. Perhaps the API hasn't rolled this out yet.
[00:12:45] <chinoto> was trying to do a grep and didn't understand why it wasn't working, found that the $ was being escaped by bash before it could be escaped by grep
[00:13:20] <tw2113> hard to tell, i'm trying to find it in their dev docs
[00:14:45] <jonathancutrell> tw2113: It's looking a bit sparse.
[00:15:24] <tw2113> i'd contact them and see if they respond at all
[00:16:17] <tw2113> and you said you tried your api key?
[00:16:31] <Cork> tw2113, jonathancutrell check the api file
[00:16:48] <Cork> theres a comment at the top that might help a bit
[00:17:12] <jonathancutrell> Cork: Are you referring to https://www.rdio.com/media/fresh/now/api-helper.js
[00:17:14] <jonathancutrell> ?
[00:17:25] <Cork> no i'm refering to https://rdio.com/api/api.js
[00:17:46] <tw2113> alert("missing client_id")
[00:18:03] <jonathancutrell> Cork: Accessing that directly doesn't help unfortunately - it responds dynamically based on your client_id param
[00:18:04] <tw2113> all i see
[00:18:13] <Cork> https://rdio.com/api/api.js?client_id=ppJo1acOvcWl8ZlpTnXUkA
[00:19:30] <jonathancutrell> Are you referring to the "Deprecated January 2013" line? :)
[00:19:47] <tw2113> i say just use their client_id
[00:20:14] <jonathancutrell> tw2113: I'll try it out and see what happens.
[00:20:59] <chinoto> ah to hell with my grep... actually, Cork there's a reason for me to potentially dislike "$(... , ...)", I can't grep for it :D
[00:21:23] <jonathancutrell> tw2113: It's restricted based on domain.
[00:21:38] <tw2113> *shrug*
[00:21:49] <tw2113> apparently cork knows where to get one or saw something i missed
[00:21:58] <Cork> chinoto: grep -rn '\$(this)' . works fine for me
[00:22:08] <tw2113> if they're offering an API, they should be offering support as well
[00:22:28] <Cork> tw2113: all i saw was the comments above client_id in the api.js file
[00:22:45] <tw2113> SOME HELP YOU ARE CORKY!
[00:22:47] <tw2113> :D
[00:23:27] <chinoto> Cork: I always use -REil, so after bash escapes it, grep's regex escapes it
[00:23:45] <Cork> tw2113,. jonathancutrell: "client_id: Your Singly OAuth 2 client ID"
[00:23:50] <Cork> https://singly.com/docs/authorization
[00:23:59] <chinoto> never had to deal with bash escaping the $ before
[00:24:21] <Cork> tw2113: so i suspect its OAuth
[00:24:31] <jonathancutrell> Makes sense.
[00:24:38] <tw2113> i feel so cheap now
[00:24:41] <tw2113> like whore
[00:24:53] <tw2113> sorry for yelling at you cork :D
[00:24:57] <Cork> lol
[00:25:33] <Cork> chinoto: ah -E you need to use a different escape then
[00:25:56] <chinoto> Cork: that's what I was saying >.<
[00:25:59] <Cork> chinoto: so grep -RErn '\$\(this\)' .
[00:26:47] <chinoto> no I already got it, it's: grep -REil "\\\$\(this\)"
[00:27:01] <Cork> O_o
[00:27:45] <Cork> i don't need that extra escape here
[00:28:22] <Cork> ah its the difference between " and '
[00:28:37] <chinoto> try this: echo "\$"; echo "\\\$"
[00:28:56] <Cork>  grep -REil '\$\(this\)' instead of what you used
[00:29:04] <chinoto> huh... I never noticed
[00:29:34] <chinoto> oh, I think I never noticed because I usually use single quotes
[00:30:00] <chinoto> hmm, my notes say otherwise
[00:31:11] <Cork> i find ! much harder to deal with in bash then $ :)
[00:31:41] <chinoto> what's up with "!"? I don't know it's role.
[00:31:58] <Cork> it will break most bash command lines
[00:32:10] <Cork> it needs to be explicitly escaped no matter where you use it
[00:32:38] <Cork> else bash will try to use it to find events
[00:32:51] <Cork> echo !test
[00:34:47] <chinoto> oh now that there is EVIL!
[00:35:15] <chinoto> if you try to escape it, you just end up with a backslash in front of it
[00:35:33] <jonathancutrell> I will try to get in touch with the Rdio folks to figure out the best way to work with this new JS api. There isn't any documentation on it, but its exactly what I need.
[00:39:35] <relipse> someone bid on this ---> https://www.freelancer.com/projects/PHP-Website-Design/Use-time-tracking-site-for.html?action=publish&hash=EalLrZY5Obw4E%2BMozA1aembKOcOcKYRDENPnQEqtkjM%3D
[00:42:31] <hdm> i may just be tired, but is there a sane way to attach things like tooltips/popovers from bootstrap on ajax content? live/on/bind work for events, but not for general plugins/behaviors
[00:43:48] <Cork> tooltips and the like has to be made for that kind of solution (no need to modify the target element), else it has to be run on each element
[00:44:00] <Cork> most tooltips plugins do changes
[00:44:28] <hdm> thanks
[00:48:21] <hdm> bootstrap's tooltip supports it, but not popover, oh well
[01:41:48] <unblockgames_> if i use jquery $.post to call a php function how do i reference the data i sent with the request in the php function?
[01:42:03] <unblockgames_> $_POST does not have anything in it BTW
[01:42:18] <_sCoRpi> unblockgames_: then you're not posting anything
[01:42:44] <unblockgames_> thats lame
[01:42:55] <Cork> unblockgames_: and you can't access a php function
[01:43:01] <Cork> you can access a php file
[01:43:27] <unblockgames_> i used console.log to verify that the post is working
[01:43:41] <unblockgames_> it has a success status and everything
[01:43:46] <unblockgames_> kinda wierd
[01:43:51] <_sCoRpi> unblockgames_: paste maybe?
[01:49:27] <ruz1> why does
[01:49:28] <ruz1> $.ajax({
[01:49:28] <ruz1>   type:'POST',
[01:49:29] <ruz1>   url:'https://api.twitter.com/oauth/access_token',
[01:49:29] <ruz1>   data:{},
[01:49:29] <ruz1>   dataType:'script'
[01:49:29] <ruz1> }); returns 401
[01:49:32] <ruz1> returns 401 ?
[01:50:13] <mansoor-s> ruz1, first, don't paste code in the channel. Read the channel title
[01:50:24] <mansoor-s> ruz1, second look up what 401 status code means
[01:50:48] <ruz1> i know what the 401 is :/
[01:50:52] <creativx> 401 means server does not like you
[01:51:06] <ruz1> unhautorized
[01:51:21] <ruz1> but the twitter api doc sad i need to post to that url
[01:51:25] <Cork> ruz1: you normally can't do ajax post cross domains
[01:51:33] <unblockgames_> this is my post
[01:51:35] <unblockgames_> http://jsfiddle.net/6CPUR/
[01:51:36] <mansoor-s> ruz1, you probably need jsonp or something
[01:51:49] <ruz1> uhm ok going trying
[01:51:59] <unblockgames_> in the php function toDatabase all i do is echo the $_POST count
[01:52:14] <unblockgames_> and my debugger says it is 0
[01:52:32] <mansoor-s>  unblockgames_ try ##php?
[01:52:36] <Cork> unblockgames_: $.post doesn't return if its successfull or not
[01:52:57] <Cork> it returns a deferred object for tracking if it success
[01:53:02] <unblockgames_> no no
[01:53:06] <unblockgames_> i have it logged
[01:53:10] <unblockgames_> i can view the whole object
[01:53:14] <unblockgames_> i can see the response text
[01:53:15] <Cork> ya
[01:53:26] <Cork> but you don't know if its successfull there
[01:53:35] <Cork> cause the call haven't happend yet
[01:55:37] <unblockgames_> so your saying that if i was successfully posting
[01:55:46] <unblockgames_> the $_POST variable would have data
[01:55:49] <unblockgames_> end of story
[01:56:13] <unblockgames_> it makes sense
[01:56:23] <Cork> most likely yes
[01:56:35] <Cork> unless body and subject is undefined
[01:57:00] <Cork> oh wait
[01:57:03] <Cork> you're using an array
[01:57:55] <xec> and he's using the array as an object =(
[01:58:06] <Cork> ya
[01:58:09] <Cork> unblockgames_: http://jsfiddle.net/6CPUR/1/
[01:58:16] <Cork> i suggest doing that instead
[01:58:43] <Cork> array is for itterable values without keys
[01:58:59] <Cork> objects is for php like named keys
[01:59:14] <Cork> [] == new Array(); {} == new Object();
[01:59:57] <unblockgames_> that worked
[02:00:02] <unblockgames_> i would have never figured that out
[02:00:14] <unblockgames_> it is now saying 2 variables in post
[02:00:19] <unblockgames_> thanks
[02:02:30] <Whiskey> http://jsfiddle.net/e8u8s/7/ how do you get the equal width to work for both tables?
[02:03:04] <ruz1> does someone has link to tuorial or source code for php/ajax twitter oauth sigin?
[02:03:26] <Cork> Whiskey: http://jsfiddle.net/e8u8s/9/
[02:04:26] <Whiskey> no no on
[02:04:28] <Whiskey> not like that :)
[02:04:55] <Whiskey> the jquery need to to them eqiual :)
[02:05:05] <Whiskey> else it wuld be really wrong
[02:05:22] <Cork> grep the width of the two tables and set the width of to the widest one
[02:05:34] <Whiskey> clork i talk about the rows in the table
[02:05:56] <Cork> the answer is still the same
[02:06:00] <Whiskey> the $(this).find('td').each( shuld be equal whit both tables
[02:06:07] <Whiskey> Cork, i don´t do js :)
[02:06:10] <Cork> you need to loop over them and then find the widest value and use that
[02:06:56] <Whiskey> yeh :) then i need to know how it shuld be coded also :D
[02:07:21] <Cork> i won't code your page for you
[02:07:47] <Whiskey> :P
[02:08:10] <Whiskey> maybe i can slove it in a h or something whit some googleing :)
[02:08:49] <chinoto> hmm, I think I has an idea, brb
[02:08:49] <mazzachre> I have a strange problem here... I have made a jsfiddle with the interaction I want http://jsfiddle.net/mazzachre/KXnTJ/19/ Which works (for the purpose of the demo) however when I copy this into the actual page (housed in an IBM websphere)  it does something strange => When I start the resize interaction the element is located at minus the scrolled value of the container (So it is moved a lot to the left as soon as interaction
[02:08:49] <mazzachre> starts. I can't seem to figure out where this happens :(
[02:10:17] <chinoto> Whiskey: Math.max($(this).find('td').map(function() {return $(this).width();}));
[02:10:25] <chinoto> that should work
[02:12:47] <Whiskey> chinoto: not really http://jsfiddle.net/e8u8s/10/
[02:13:15] <Whiskey> and not http://jsfiddle.net/e8u8s/11/
[02:14:19] <anli> When I use .animate, the text (an a
[02:14:20] <anli> oops
[02:14:24] <chinoto> oh bollocks
[02:15:07] <anli> When I use .animate, the text (an 'a' inside 'div') gets one pixel or so different width during the animation, causing a word break in a slightly different position than when the animation is ready, that will be ugly, can I avoid that?
[02:16:47] <anli> Is there a way to halt a javascript so I can watch css values during an animation?
[02:16:48] <chinoto> HAHA!
[02:17:07] <chinoto> Math.max.apply(null,$(document).find('td').map(function() {return $(this).width();}).get())
[02:17:29] <chinoto> eh... change "document" to "this" >.>
[02:17:50] <Cork> anli: you could try setting overflow: hidden on the div
[02:18:11] <chinoto> if you use this often enough, you could add it as a function to jQuery.fn
[02:18:13] <anli> Cork: ok, trying, but cant see the logic
[02:19:05] <Whiskey> chinoto: still nothing http://jsfiddle.net/e8u8s/12/
[02:19:37] <anli> Cork: Had no effect, I dont think there will be an overflow btw, its a div with a width and its an inline-block
[02:20:19] <computer2000> anyone can help me using require.js as simple script loader? im trying to load scripts dependent on which page has loaded http://pastebin.com/xFePX4Vp
[02:20:32] <Cork> anli: would have to see the animation to give a better suggestion then
[02:21:15] <chinoto> Whiskey: all my code was meant to do, was return the max width
[02:21:27] <Whiskey> ooo
[02:21:34] <chinoto> it's up to you to actually do something with it
[02:22:22] <chinoto> btw, I said replace document with this, not null with this
[02:22:40] <sheilablackrose> hi guys
[02:24:34] <Whiskey> chinoto: shuld not this work
[02:24:35] <Whiskey> http://jsfiddle.net/e8u8s/13/
[02:25:18] <Marlie> Hello
[02:25:31] <Marlie> I have never wrote a line in JS or jquery in my life and i'm trying to learn to use it. I have followed up a few tutorials on the web and i'm trying to add a class name to a HTML element, but I seem to be doing it wrong because nothing happens
[02:25:31] <chinoto> sigh, no
[02:25:37] <Marlie> This is what i have: http://pastebin.com/LZs8GhzL
[02:25:51] <Whiskey> well acully: http://jsfiddle.net/e8u8s/14/
[02:25:53] <chinoto> as I just said "replace document with this, not null with this"
[02:26:00] <Whiskey> that does give correct width
[02:26:17] <Marlie> I'm using wordpress, i forgot to mention
[02:26:32] <Whiskey> yeh still same result
[02:26:39] <Whiskey> the width is correct, but the rows not equal
[02:26:52] <chinoto> dear god D:
[02:27:14] <Whiskey> chinoto: i don´t code JS
[02:28:03] <chinoto> what you did was for every single table cell, figure out the max of every table cells' width regardless of which table it was in
[02:28:55] <chinoto> let the understanding of the potential performance hit sink in...
[02:29:54] <chinoto> oh and btw, the code is broken anyway --[04:28:54.734] ReferenceError: maxWidth is not defined @ http://fiddle.jshell.net/_display/:352
[02:30:05] <Whiskey> thats not good
[02:30:29] <chinoto> not a big deal, I'll fix it, and explain changes
[02:32:06] <sheilablackrose> there some weird behaviour in my code. every jquery function is run twice. like onclick function get runs twice. i had to do a .unbind.bind  than only it ran once. what could couse this?
[02:33:15] <anli> Cork: I have put some screenshots online
[02:33:16] <anli> http://anders.dev.100procent.com/word_break_problem/
[02:33:45] <Cork> anli: that doens't help i need to inspect the css
[02:33:52] <Cork> and see what causes the shift
[02:33:53] <anli> oh, you see it there?
[02:33:55] <Asa34> hi, If I want to use sliding panels in jquery mobile which branch should I use? Is it supported im 1.2.0 final?
[02:33:58] <anli> aha
[02:35:23] <anli> At least, I have the firebug console open in the screenshots... I can perhaps make it available for real as well
[02:36:57] <Whiskey> thats good
[02:38:16] <chinoto> Whiskey: http://jsfiddle.net/e8u8s/15/
[02:39:18] <Whiskey> that most be incorrect chilversc
[02:39:29] <Whiskey> chinoto
[02:39:49] <chinoto> hmm...
[02:40:15] <chinoto> I think I know the necessary tweak
[02:42:28] <Whiskey> http://jsfiddle.net/e8u8s/16 chinoto: you see it use some extra space
[02:42:50] <Whiskey> drop that btw its correct in the view
[02:43:57] <Whiskey> http://jsfiddle.net/e8u8s/17/ thats more incorrect, feels like it reads the width twice for etch table
[02:45:26] <Cork> Whiskey: you should be using $.map not $().map
[02:46:05] <cuqa> hey: http://jsfiddle.net/vjE2y/8/ ... I want to retrieve the index of the dragged item, but it always returns the total number of indexes
[02:46:20] <Cork> (thats not the answer to the twice problem though
[02:46:27] <chinoto> Cork: why? he wants the width of elements...
[02:46:50] <chinoto> Whiskey: are you trying to get the columns to be equal width?
[02:47:01] <Cork> chinoto: cause right now you find all td, loop over then create an array, then converts that array into a jquery object
[02:47:13] <Cork> to then again grab the first value from the jquery object
[02:47:21] <Cork> instead of just creating an array straight up
[02:47:24] <Cork> ?.map
[02:47:25] <bot-t1> .map(callback): Pass each element in the current matched set through a function, producing a new jQuery object containing the return values. http://api.jquery.com/map/
[02:47:28] <Cork> ?jQuery.map
[02:47:28] <Whiskey> chinoto: yes
[02:47:28] <bot-t1> jQuery.map(array, callback): Translate all items in an array or object to new array of items. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.map/
[02:47:51] <chinoto> I have a no js solution for you :P
[02:47:59] <Whiskey> the width shuld be as the longest tdfor all tds
[02:48:28] <Whiskey> you prb don´t chinoto: it won´t work
[02:48:31] <Whiskey> thats why JS has to do it
[02:48:51] <Whiskey> i have "dipslay: table" in my body thats why its borken in CSS
[02:49:07] <Cork> Whiskey: the most solid solution is to make the two tables into one big table
[02:49:12] <Cork> and you get the size for free
[02:51:03] <Whiskey> Cork yeh but theproblem is if i add something else in it like a brder as i have in my full code it braks anyways
[02:52:34] <Cork> Whiskey: why would a border break row sizing?
[02:55:05] <Whiskey> it did that for me
[02:57:38] <Whiskey> Anyways http://jsfiddle.net/e8u8s/18/ there, and it was supose to be between 12/01 on next border, so when it feel more easy to count width for all borders on same time,
[02:57:51] <Whiskey> then try get the border on right place
[03:01:15] <chinoto> works: http://jsfiddle.net/e8u8s/19/
[03:01:51] <Whiskey> lol then the whole point dropped :)
[03:01:54] <chinoto> I was terribly confused because after I said I could do it without js, I realized you had a ton of css
[03:01:57] <Whiskey> i wuld use a fullscreen size
[03:02:48] <chinoto> all I did was add "table-layout:fixed;" to tbody
[03:03:18] <chinoto> I mean it isn't really a ton, but for some reason I didn't notice you had any...
[03:03:27] <Whiskey> http://jsfiddle.net/e8u8s/20/ that also work but not eqial
[03:03:30] <Whiskey> equal
[03:03:43] <mazzachre> Is there any way to debug jquery in jsfiddle? I need to see if the value returned to me by an internal function is the same on my fiddle as on my own page
[03:03:46] <chinoto> which was really dumb because it wasn't browser defaults
[03:04:27] <Whiskey> hehe :)
[03:04:38] <Whiskey> anyways how hard can it be to get all tds equal sized on all tables
[03:04:56] <chinoto> you could save the value to variable, then alert it or console.log it, then use it where you would have used it
[03:05:13] <computer2000> is this really true: isnt it possible to inject '<span>' without a closing tag into the dom with jquery? ive read jquery doesnt allow 'malformed html' to be injected, thats why it automatically inserts a closing tag then?? how can i just insert an opening tag without the closure?
[03:05:15] <chinoto> console.log is nice because it doesn't interrupt the code
[03:06:24] <Whiskey> yeh i know about it
[03:06:51] <chinoto> well this should work fine "$('<span>').append('<b>blarg</b>')", but I don't know about $('<span><b>blarg</b>')
[03:08:29] <Whiskey> append?
[03:11:35] <chinoto> Whiskey: "a.append(b)" "b" becomes the last child of "a"
[03:12:37] <xec> computer2000: there is a difference between DOM and HTML - you can
[03:12:48] <xec> 't have an unclosed DOM element
[03:12:49] <computer2000> xec: how?
[03:13:04] <Whiskey> chinoto: im to bad on those things :/
[03:13:33] <xec> computer2000: the real question is; why/when would you only want an opening tag?
[03:14:04] <computer2000> xec: i need to wrap a certain amount of pure html text, no chance to select it with common jquery selectors...
[03:15:02] <xec> computer2000: is this "pure html text" a js string stored in a var or what?
[03:15:19] <computer2000> xec: no its just text in a html file
[03:16:10] <Marlie> hiding a html element will hide all of it's children or do i have to use siblings() as well?
[03:16:11] <xec> can you paste (all) the content of this html in a pastebin or something, so i can see what you're talking about?
[03:16:11] <chinoto> computer2000: I would just try $('<span>').html(myHTML)
[03:17:01] <chinoto> of course, you have to append it somewhere, but I figure that's a given
[03:17:38] <xec> chinoto: sure, but that assumes he has a var with the string, which is why i asked ;)
[03:17:42] <computer2000> xec: its not online but its easy to understand: its just text in a p element on a page and i need to select a certain amount of it
[03:17:48] <angryasian> well chinoto you'd want to store that newly created span in a variable most likely.
[03:18:15] <xec> ?p @ computer2000
[03:18:16] <bot-t1> computer2000, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[03:18:30] <chinoto> angryasian: only if you need to process it more, in which case you could probably just chain commands together
[03:18:59] <angryasian> yep
[03:19:05] <computer2000> xec: http://pastebin.com/vGT3cvjv
[03:19:25] <chinoto> then... why bring it up if it isn
[03:19:31] <chinoto> isn't needed*
[03:20:10] <xec> computer2000: ok, so what are you trying to do, specifically. what is the end result you want?
[03:20:38] <computer2000> xec: i need to select, say, the first 20 words of that big text.... then wrap it inside a span with class 'wrap' or something
[03:21:28] <chinoto> god I love autoindent for notepad++
[03:23:04] <computer2000> xec: any idea?
[03:23:19] <chinoto> computer2000: the javascript in the page just sets some variables...
[03:23:40] <computer2000> chinoto: that comes from a php file, its not the main script
[03:24:11] <computer2000> its just about wrapping the first 20 words of the text into something
[03:24:57] <Asa34> hi, If I want to use sliding panels in jquery mobile which branch should I use? Is it supported in 1.2.0 final?
[03:25:24] <Whiskey> chinoto: http://jsfiddle.net/e8u8s/17/ it reads the bot longest tds from both tables :)(
[03:26:32] <xec> computer2000: http://jsfiddle.net/CYvAw/
[03:26:48] <chinoto> Whiskey: {table-layout:fixed} seemed to work, what's wrong?
[03:27:21] <xec> computer2000: might be better to extract the text with .text() rather than .html() if you only want the text
[03:27:30] <computer2000> xec: thats the first 20 chars, i need the first 20 words... basically, i want to select all text until the word which has been clicked
[03:27:54] <Whiskey> it use 100% width
[03:29:04] <Whiskey> the point is to just use needed width
[03:29:33] <xec> computer2000: okay, if you want each word clickable with a different result for each, i think you might be best off creating an element for each
[03:30:13] <computer2000> xec: ok probably
[03:31:50] <xec> computer2000: when you have a huge number of event handlers like that it's usually better to use a delegate - are you familiar with that concept?
[03:32:25] <computer2000> xec: heard it, but not really
[03:32:28] <computer2000> mvc
[03:33:18] <Whiskey> chinoto: get it to work on whole screen is not hard :)
[03:33:25] <chinoto> Whiskey: ok, so all td's of each table should be as long as the td with the most content?
[03:33:27] <xec> computer2000: have a read here http://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events
[03:34:25] <xec> computer2000: basically you put a single event handler on an ancestor element and it filters out the clicks you want
[03:34:26] <Whiskey> chinoto: correct
[03:37:33] <alaing> Hi I'm building a plugin and I would like to pass ui to a customer event that is triggered. this is what I have so far but it does appear to be working http://jsfiddle.net/XkykX/3/
[03:38:00] <alaing> towards js line 33 is where I think I might be going wrong
[03:38:05] <chinoto> to hell with no js, seems you can only use that method if you explicitly set each td or the table
[03:38:47] <Whiskey> chinoto: what you talking about?
[03:39:02] <chinoto> table-layout:fixed
[03:42:57] <Whiskey> hehe
[03:43:05] <chinoto> Whiskey: http://jsfiddle.net/e8u8s/21/
[03:44:13] <chinoto> commented out some css for table and tbody, boom it works (or I misinterpreted)
[03:45:09] <chinoto> also created the children variable to avoid duplicating code execution
[03:45:59] <Whiskey> chinoto: still not work in dubble table
[03:46:24] <rakl> how can I select all the checked checkboses in side a form tag?
[03:46:25] <chinoto> are you talking about tables within tables?
[03:46:29] <rakl> checkboxes*
[03:46:52] <Whiskey> no its 2 spearated table
[03:46:54] <Whiskey> no its 2 spearated tables
[03:46:55] <mazzachre> How to remove "hover" event handler?
[03:47:37] <chinoto> rakl: $(myform).find('input[type=checkbox]').filter(function() {return this.checked;})
[03:47:45] <Whiskey> http://jsfiddle.net/e8u8s/23/ <-- there
[03:48:16] <Whiskey> you see the width is correct now for both tables, but if the other table rows is bigger the only tabke whit less content on rows are allowed to expand them to 100% of the border its in
[03:48:24] <chinoto> rakl: or $(':checked',myform)
[03:48:40] <Whiskey> well CSS Test shuld look as JavaScript test
[03:48:43] * rakl is testing
[03:50:33] <rakl> chinoto worked great. is there a shortcut for getting their values as well?
[03:50:41] <chinoto> rakl: make that $(':checked[type=checkbox]',myform)
[03:51:12] <Whiskey> chinoto: you get what i mean?
[03:51:24] <chinoto> rakl: make that $(':checked[type=checkbox]',myform), otherwise it might get radios as well
[03:51:36] <rakl> got it
[03:51:49] <chinoto> rakl: shortcut?
[03:51:58] <chinoto> Whiskey: still mucking about with it
[03:52:02] <rakl> is it possible to get their values as well? short of iterating over them and mapping the val()
[03:52:37] <xec> computer2000: http://jsfiddle.net/CYvAw/1/
[03:53:19] <Whiskey> chinoto: if you look at http://jsfiddle.net/e8u8s/23/
[03:53:21] <alaing> Theres an error while trying to acces the jQuery Wudget documentation for jQuery UI 1.8 http://api.jqueryui.com/1.8/jQuery.widget/
[03:53:33] <chinoto> well if you want to be able to access them by name
[03:53:57] <Whiskey> the first row 01 in JavaScript Test shuld apply smae width to all others tds cuz it has largest content
[03:54:13] <Whiskey> shuld not be hard whit jquery it thinkk :( it does that know but for etch row :D
[03:54:16] <Whiskey> hmm eatch table D:
[03:54:29] <mazzachre> When I have a jQuery element, can I somehow check if this element is in the process of being resized or not? Or do I need to store that somewhere and manually remove it again?!
[03:55:12] <alaing> Hi I'm building a plugin and I would like to pass ui to a customer event that is triggered. this is what I have so far but it does appear to be working http://jsfiddle.net/XkykX/3/
[03:55:14] <alaing> towards js line 33 is where I think I might be going wrong
[03:55:27] <chinoto> rakl: var obj={};$(':checked[type=checkbox]',myform).each(function() {obj[this.name]=this.value;})
[03:55:53] <alaing> why cant i pass ui with a triggered event?
[03:55:59] <chinoto> Whiskey: should all tables should have the same table data widths?
[03:56:26] <rakl> chinoto sort of. end result I want is to actually get a comma separated string of the values attribute of the checkboxes
[03:56:37] <rakl> but if you're just iterating over them, I can write that too!
[03:56:38] <chinoto> Whiskey: or should they be individually sized?
[03:56:38] <rakl> thanks
[03:56:54] <rakl> i was hoping there was jquery magic for it :)
[03:57:04] <Whiskey> no all shuld have same size
[03:57:05] <chinoto> rakl: there is
[03:57:14] <Whiskey> all tables shuld have same size as the td whit most content
[03:57:29] * rakl is o_0
[03:58:17] <chinoto> rakl: $(':checked[type=checkbox]',myform).map(function() {return this.value}).get().join(',');
[03:59:02] <rakl> looks good to me. thanks chinoto!
[03:59:16] <chinoto> rakl: schweet
[03:59:36] <innociv> Wow jsfiddle is buggy as fuck right now
[03:59:36] <rakl> is there any point in changing it to $(this).val() instead?
[03:59:40] <rakl> or any reason not to?
[04:00:25] <rakl> i guess not using it reduces function calls, not sure if that is a big deal
[04:01:49] <chinoto> rakl: use whatever you like, val() may be needed if another jquery plugin overrides it
[04:04:09] <chinoto> Whiskey: you have to expand it out quite a bit, but it seems to be working: http://jsfiddle.net/e8u8s/24/
[04:06:14] <chinoto> one problem you'll run into is that if the window is smaller than the table needs to be on load, resizing to the preferred size will result in the text being scrunched
[04:06:30] <chinoto> to fix this, you need to have it update on window resize
[04:07:17] <chinoto> on second thought, it is somehow working perfectly...
[04:07:57] <chinoto> Whiskey: comments??
[04:09:14] <chinoto> rakl: btw, I used .value mostly because it was quicker for me to type, no philosophy really :P
[04:09:31] <rakl> ahh gotcha
[04:10:43] <chinoto> it seems Whiskey isn't going to respond, I'm gonna go to bed so I can at least get half an hour of sleep... *headdesk*
[04:11:34] <chinoto> 6:10AM, getting woken up at 7AMish
[04:11:43] <chinoto> just great...
[04:11:47] <rakl> chinoto want to debug my python code?
[04:11:48] <rakl>  :p
[04:11:57] <chinoto> no freaking way
[04:12:10] <rakl> http://pastie.org/5642333
[04:12:18] <chinoto> I don't know python, so that could be an all day project
[04:16:52] <chinoto> rakl: what do you expect int to do? from experience with php, it should turn data that could be an integer into one, or 0 if it can't
[04:17:13] <Whiskey> that looks corrrect chino
[04:17:22] <rakl> no the problem is that the string I'm expecting isn't splitting into an array
[04:17:31] <rakl> s/array/list
[04:18:11] <Whiskey> its perfect: thanks chinoto :D
[04:18:25] <chinoto> Whiskey: SCHWEET!
[04:18:35] <chinoto> that bitch took forever!
[04:18:57] <chinoto> mostly because I wasn't totally sure of the goal
[04:19:06] <Whiskey> hehe :)
[04:19:47] <chinoto> rakl: I'm no python programmer, I'm to bed
[04:20:18] <rakl> :)
[04:20:19] <chinoto> "boy ti'ed, boy goin' to bed"
[04:20:20] <rakl> good night
[04:20:21] <Whiskey> hehe its freaking awsome :)
[04:20:22] <rakl> thanks for the help
[04:20:27] <Whiskey> anyways thx again chinoto
[04:36:44] <computer2000> xec: thx man!
[04:41:08] <Marlie> How do i hide a div before the page even loads?
[04:41:38] <Marlie> with $(window).load(function(){ ?
[04:43:06] <anli> Is there some autocomplete textbox that can autocomplete against an ajax url?
[04:44:48] <xec> anli: http://jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#remote
[04:45:03] <anli> Cool
[04:45:18] <anli> I like the progress indicator also
[04:50:37] <computer2000> xec: only problem left is that i lose the links after text wrap update
[04:56:20] <Marlie> I have this little snippet that is supposed to show and hide a div on clicking an anchor
[04:56:21] <Marlie> http://pastebin.com/i90nhsAB
[04:56:46] <Marlie> When the page loads the div is hidden and the div has "closed" class appended
[04:56:56] <Marlie> When i click the anchor it shows up and changes to "opened"
[04:57:02] <Marlie> But when i click again it doesn't hide it back
[04:57:04] <reuf> hello - i have a form and in it i have 2 fields with name A and B, when i do jquery ajax and fetch the values of these fileds $('input[name=A]').val(); and $('input[name=B]').val(); it gets value of input A correctly, but in case of B it fetches old request, does not fetch the new one - what might seemt to be the problem?
[04:57:04] <Marlie> Why?
[04:58:21] <xec> computer2000: if you want to preserve the html you probably want .html() instead of .text() and some regex-fu ;)
[05:02:22] <arkascha> I have been using the 'impromptu' dialog extension for quite some time now, happy with it...
[05:02:43] <arkascha> Now I realize that the dialogs won't close in MS IE (9) as they do in all other browsers.
[05:03:01] <arkascha> I get a 'incorrect function' inside the jquery ui close() routines.
[05:03:16] <arkascha> Anyone knows that problem?
[05:03:26] <Hooloovoo> what's impromptu?
[05:03:38] <arkascha> As said: a dialog extension to jquery.
[05:03:40] <arkascha> One sec...
[05:03:54] <arkascha> http://trentrichardson.com/Impromptu/
[05:04:18] <computer2000> xec: can u help me with the regex? just need to keep the links inside the html
[05:06:38] <xec> computer2000: sorry, got some work that needs to get done, you might be able to get away with something simple like just ignoring words that start with < or end with >
[05:06:52] <computer2000> xec: ok thx man
[05:07:11] <xec> ?glwtd @ computer2000
[05:07:21] <bot-t> computer2000, http://goodluckwiththatdude.com/
[05:07:33] <computer2000> lol thx
[05:10:06] <xec> Marlie: it's easier to see whats going on with your code if you can provide a live demo reproducing the issue, check out jsfiddle.net - also; much of your code seems redundant (but that's beside the point really)
[05:11:30] <Marlie> xec: i am a beginner and it is a really good point to hear xec, please elaborate
[05:11:58] <Lemm__> can anybody tell me why my submit button is not taking this function..http://jsfiddle.net/uqrkn/ ?
[05:12:18] <Marlie> xec: i've replaced the second if with else if and it worked
[05:13:09] <xec> ?demo @ Marlie
[05:13:10] <bot-t> Marlie, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[05:13:21] <Marlie> Ok
[05:13:24] <Cronoh> lemm_, you need to either do this on the form submit event, or prevent default action on click and manually submit the form after
[05:13:29] <xec> Marlie: specifically, it would be nice to see the html alongside
[05:14:15] <xec> Marlie: i'm thinking you could replace most your code with a .toggle() call, see ?toggle
[05:15:18] <bot-t> Marlie, .toggle(handler, handler, [handler]): Bind two or more handlers to the matched elements, to be executed on alternate clicks. http://api.jquery.com/toggle/
[05:16:06] <xec> toggle is two things, ignore the bot text but see the link
[05:18:37] <Lemm__> ?
[05:19:53] <xec> ?submit @ Lemm__
[05:20:21] <Marlie> how do i include jquery in fiddle xec ?
[05:20:24] <Cork> and don't use inline event listeners
[05:20:36] <Cork> Marlie: the dropdown on the left
[05:20:39] <xec> Marlie: there is a framework dropdown in the left menu
[05:21:27] <Lemm__> I mean for some reason is not taking the validar() function when i submit http://jsfiddle.net/uqrkn/
[05:21:59] <Cronoh> "is not taking"
[05:22:03] <Cronoh> what does that mean
[05:22:51] <Cork> Lemm__: 1) your unsing onclick not submit, 2) you're using inline event listeners, 3) you're defineing validar in an onload event listener, 4) you're not loading jquery
[05:22:55] <Marlie> can't get the JS code to work in jsfiddle http://jsfiddle.net/6Zjfz/
[05:23:14] <Cronoh> also simply md5'ing a password is not at all sufficient security
[05:23:57] <Lemm__> Cork: im using md5.js
[05:24:16] <Cork> Marlie: [14:23:53.039] SyntaxError: missing } after function body
[05:25:47] <Cork> Marlie: additionally $('top-nav-sem a') and friends isn't valid
[05:25:54] <Cork> id's need to have # infront of them
[05:26:08] <Cork> (or . if they're classes)
[05:26:13] <Lemm__> ive solved it
[05:26:14] <Lemm__> thanks
[05:26:18] <Marlie> fixing it now i'm also missing a few parantheses
[05:27:42] <Marlie> No joy http://jsfiddle.net/6Zjfz/1/
[05:28:58] <Marlie> Also forgot a " . " classname at the else if
[05:30:04] <Marlie> Works well on my site but not on jsfiddle
[05:31:21] <nFFF> jsfiddle is buggy as fuark
[05:32:12] <xec> Marlie: i would probably do something like this: http://jsfiddle.net/6Zjfz/2/
[05:32:59] <Cork> and you're original code fixed: http://jsfiddle.net/6Zjfz/3/
[05:33:06] <Cork> but ya xec's version is prob what you want
[05:33:31] <Cork> and you should removed the a tag from the equation
[05:33:50] <Cork> that old focus hack isn't needed anymore (it was needed for ie5.5)
[05:34:37] <xec> yeah and noone uses ie5.5 anymore. netscape is much better
[05:34:39] <Marlie> Cork: xec these are my first lines of javascript/jquery no idea what old focus hack is
[05:34:53] <Marlie> Cork: why did you included everything in a function ?
[05:35:08] <Marlie> include*
[05:35:28] <Marlie> Cork: nevermind.
[05:35:43] <xec> Marlie: $(function(){}) is a shorthand for $(document).ready(function(){})
[05:36:06] <Marlie> Yes xec i have that on my site, i skipped it accidentally
[05:36:19] <xec> Marlie: and is executed on DOM ready (as opposed to window load, which is later, after all resources like images etc is loaded)
[05:36:21] <Cork> Marlie: <a href="#"></a>
[05:36:26] <Cork> ^hack
[05:36:55] <Cork> if you want keyboard focus for you're button/what ever use tabindex="0"
[05:37:07] <Cork> no need to create broken links
[05:37:08] <xec> your* :D
[05:37:17] <Cork> :7
[05:37:24] * xec hugs Cork
[05:37:32] <Cork> :9
[05:37:40] <Marlie> Cork: i don't need keyboard focus. Will href="" do fine then?
[05:37:59] <Cork> Marlie: if you don't need keyboard focus you can just plainly remove the a tag
[05:38:00] <Marlie> xec: thanks for telling me that :)
[05:38:06] <Cork> and use the parent element instead
[05:38:22] <Cork> or if you need it for css use a span instead of the a tag
[05:38:31] <xec> Marlie: you don't need an anchor at all, change <li id="top-nav-sem"><a href="#">PUSH ME</a></li> to <li id="top-nav-sem">PUSH ME</li> and change $('#top-nav-sem a') to $('#top-nav-sem')
[05:38:31] <Marlie> But i want the little hand mouse pointer
[05:38:44] <Cork> cursor: pointer;
[05:38:52] <Marlie> is it bad for SEO ?
[05:39:03] <Marlie> having an empty href ?
[05:39:15] <Cork> it will make the browsers render weird interfaces
[05:39:30] <Cork> cause it will show it as a link when its not
[05:39:48] <Marlie> I see your point
[05:40:04] <Marlie> Marlie's hand will get slapped next time
[05:40:26] <Marlie> or bashed with a hammer
[05:40:46] <Marlie> thank you :-)
[05:40:50] <Cork> Marlie: i would set tabindex="0" in the button though
[05:41:01] <Cork> just to make it accessable
[05:41:01] <Marlie> no idea what that is but will look it up
[05:41:21] <Cork> its an attribute that makes the element focusable
[05:42:24] <Marlie> is this channel logged?
[05:43:40] <Cork> yes
[05:43:44] <Cork> see the topic
[05:45:20] <Marlie> thanks xec , Cork have a pleasent day :-)
[05:52:05] <unblockgames_> im having a stange issue where im posting two variables but when i count in php it returns 1 heres the post request http://jsfiddle.net/yqeK7/
[05:53:14] <sarahfrantz> Anyone know how to add swipe functionality to this piece of jquery http://jsfiddle.net/EGzb3/
[05:53:18] <sarahfrantz> I'm struggling
[05:53:45] <sarahfrantz> I basically want that .click to also function via swiping
[05:58:09] <Cork> unblockgames_: you mean count($_POST) ?
[05:58:26] <unblockgames_> cork yes
[05:58:34] <Cork> unblockgames_: is orderTotal or order undefined or null?
[05:58:54] <unblockgames_> order is a multidimensional array
[05:58:59] <unblockgames_> and orderTotal is a float
[05:59:11] <Cork> uh js doesn't have load
[05:59:13] <Cork> *float
[05:59:34] <unblockgames_> it is whatever toFixed returns
[05:59:44] <unblockgames_> its a valid number
[05:59:46] <Cork> unblockgames_: have you checked in the development console what data it actually sends?
[05:59:54] <unblockgames_> i will check now
[05:59:58] <unblockgames_> actually
[06:00:02] <unblockgames_> where in the console is that
[06:00:13] <Cork> unblockgames_: toFixed returns a string
[06:00:13] <unblockgames_> does it say in one of the properties?
[06:00:20] <unblockgames_> kk
[06:00:30] <Cork> what browser are you using?
[06:00:33] <unblockgames_> chrome
[06:01:19] <Cork> network > request > headers > parameters
[06:04:26] <unblockgames_> cork
[06:04:29] <unblockgames_> it just says orderTotal:1074598.23
[06:04:38] <unblockgames_> it doesnt have my order array :(
[06:11:09] <syph0n> Is there any way to capture the CSS-transformed value of a control via .val() or similar? For example: http://jsfiddle.net/QrHwt
[06:11:50] <unblockgames_> i have done a console log on the order variable and it is an array with arrays inside it
[06:12:00] <unblockgames_> and those arrays contain the proper data
[06:12:04] <unblockgames_> idk its not working
[06:12:36] <unblockgames_> does post not support arrays?
[06:13:43] <Cameron_> is there any way to only display a radius around the mouse of an image using jquery?

[06:27:05] <aero1> Anticom: no it's not
[06:27:28] <Anticom> strange, my browser is saying, that it is 404

[06:56:36] <mazzachre> Oho, apparently in IE8 (dunno about 9) if you add -ms-filter:"progid:DXImageTransform.Microsoft.Alpha(opacity=30)" to an element that have background: transparent, then almost everything stop working (events don't fire right, for one thing) Anyone else have this problem? Or found a solution?

[07:16:16] <unblockgames_> http://jsfiddle.net/Lmwxf/
[07:16:31] <unblockgames_> in the php file, i decode the json sting
[07:16:37] <unblockgames_> then use count

[07:16:51] <unblockgames_> i get absolutely nothing
[07:17:00] <unblockgames_> pretty frustrating actually

[07:24:11] <unblockgames_> i fail to see how specifying the response data type has anything to do with send data to the server

[07:46:22] <brasuca> algum brasileiro?
[07:48:17] <aphpperson> I have a javascript function that works when it does a .find("img:first").attr('src','/images/image.jpg')  the problem is that when my images are uploaded, they have timestamps appended for caching purposes like this: image.jpg?123456789.  is there anyway to do my find on the src attribute, but discregard everything after the image.jpg?
[07:51:19] * hlve slaps NoiseEee around a bit with a large trout
[07:52:20] <aphpperson> or can anyone tell me if I can do a .find().attr('src', REGEX HERE) ?
[07:52:58] <seutje> is jsfiddle broken? o.O
[07:53:28] <NodeX> you can use [src*=[...... in the selector
[07:53:42] <NodeX> ?contains
[07:53:42] <bot-t1> :contains(text): Select all elements that contain the specified text. http://api.jquery.com/contains-selector/
[07:54:04] <NodeX> http://api.jquery.com/attribute-contains-selector/
[07:54:13] <xec> seutje: no, but it's been a bit buggy for me since they switched the text editor - works after a refresh usually
[07:54:59] <Aquaguy> Hello guys
[07:55:41] <seutje> xec: refreshed couple times, still getting Object has no method getCode :(
[07:55:46] <seutje> to the jsbin machine!
[07:56:26] <Aquaguy> I was just checking the API for jQuery.post() and the shorthand example is wrong, not that the code is wrong but it's showing some <em> tags that I guess are for styling keywords
[08:05:38] <aphpperson> NodeX: contains-selector sounds exactly what I'm looking for.  But can I appaent something like that to a ...find("img:first") ?  I'm a little lost with the syntax of that
[08:05:47] <aphpperson> append*
[08:06:22] <aphpperson> I tried ..find("img:first").attr('src*','/images/image.jpg'); but that didnt seem to work
[08:10:44] <xec> aphpperson: what are you trying to do exactly?
[08:11:31] <xec> aphpperson: what is the original html source, and what should it end up as?
[08:12:03] <ecky--ptang-zoob> Anyone who speaks fluent french here?
[08:12:28] <Anticom> hey xec :)
[08:12:39] <Anticom> um, is there any docs for .load(function() {}); ??
[08:13:05] <NodeX> ?load
[08:13:05] <b-ot> NodeX, like an .get but with the possibility to choose section to load (like with anchor)
[08:13:06] <bot-t1> .load(handler): Bind an event handler to the "load" JavaScript event. http://api.jquery.com/load-event/
[08:13:06] <Anticom> from what i see in the docs it's said, that first param "url" is not optional
[08:13:28] <Anticom> NodeX thanks buddy :)
[08:13:32] <Anticom> google tricked me
[08:13:38] <marcules> aphpperson, you would want to use it in your find statement - without the .attr appended
[08:14:08] <Anticom> so i've got a short question to that... if i don't change the src attribute of an iframe the load-event obviously won't fire, will it?
[08:14:11] <Anticom> just to be sure :D
[08:14:33] <aphpperson> xec: I have been trying to change the td class based on an image being clicked within that particular td.  originally it was: $(this).next().end().find("img:first").attr('src*','/images/sort_desc.png');     $(this).next().end().removeClass('expand_this').addClass('close_this');
[08:15:19] <marcules> aphpperson, something like $(yourContainer).find('img:first[src*="/images/image.jpg"]')
[08:15:53] <marcules> I am not sure about the order though
[08:17:30] <Anticom> aphpperson why don't u just add data-addClass="foo" and data-removeClass="bar" html5-data attributes to your images and work with that?
[08:17:49] <Anticom> think that would be much more elegant :)
[08:18:17] <NodeX> better to not use camelCase on "data-*"
[08:18:31] <NodeX> from personal experience it goes mad .. use hyphens instead
[08:24:20] <aphpperson> Thank you guys so much for the help!  I actually was doing it all wrong trying to find the td id of an image being clicked when I should have been referring to the (this) object as I was inside of a "click" function
[08:24:32] <aphpperson> learned something tho.. so thanks alot
[08:26:42] <Anticom> NodeX was just a quick idea... didn't think about that ;)
[08:26:47] <xec> hey Anticom, hows life :)
[08:27:05] <Anticom> xec brain is bursting... so much to do in so little time ;)
[08:27:18] <Anticom> happy new year's btw
[08:27:30] <Anticom> how are you doing xec?
[08:27:30] <xec> indeed, you too!
[08:27:42] <xec> working hard
[08:27:52] <xec> or hardly working, can't decide
[08:28:03] <Anticom> so everything as usual i guess haha
[08:28:32] <xec> hehe, i resent that ;D
[08:28:43] <aDatabase> I have a question. I would like to match all elements starting in "element" and ending in "X". So far I have this: *[class^='element'] - how would I extend that to look for a prefix too?
[08:29:02] <Anticom> omg i've got such a stoopid question because i think i've never done this before
[08:29:25] <Anticom> how do i pass a function name into a callback? i mean instead of writing an anonymous function instead
[08:29:26] <Anticom> ???
[08:29:41] <Anticom> .load(myFunc); ??
[08:29:45] <xec> yeah
[08:29:49] <Anticom> k, thx
[08:29:53] <xec> assuming myFunc is in scope
[08:30:59] <Francis47> hey - i got this: var MMI = $('.main-article-image img').src; how do i print that inside the href part of this: $('head').append('<link rel="image_src" href="" />'); ?
[08:31:06] <xec> aDatabase: you can have multiple attribute selectors, like [][]
[08:31:11] <aDatabase> oho
[08:31:13] <aDatabase> that easy, huh?
[08:31:14] <aDatabase> thanks
[08:31:54] <xec> at least i assume you can, haven't tried it :)
[08:32:43] <aDatabase> hmm
[08:32:46] <aDatabase> not matching
[08:33:01] <xec> ?demo @ aDatabase
[08:33:02] <bot-t1> aDatabase, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[08:33:10] <aDatabase> Sure, I was just about to do that :D
[08:34:19] <aDatabase> (while I do that, the offending match is *[class^='element'][class$='X'], and I'd like to match .element1X, element2X, etcetera)
[08:34:20] <marcules> Francis47, either you add it to the string like ...href="' + MMI + '"... or you access the link afterwards and set the href with .attr('href', MMI)
[08:35:20] <xec> aDatabase: do the elements have multiple classnames?
[08:35:40] <aDatabase> um, yes
[08:35:41] <xec> (if so it wouldn't work, you'd need to loop the classnames and check each)
[08:35:43] <aDatabase> because they're being dragged
[08:36:49] <aDatabase> hmm, okay
[08:37:11] <Anticom> i know, the question isn't related to jq, but guys over at #javascript seem to be a bit lazy today, so i'll try my luck here: does anyone know, if any browser (including our beloved IE6+) has any problems with nested functions?
[08:37:36] <Francis47> marcules: i tried the ' + MMI +' approach - but it returns undefined
[08:37:59] <marcules> Then try
[08:38:09] <marcules> var MMI = $('.main-article-image img').attr('src');
[08:38:15] <soahccc> Does anybody know something to accomplish this? I know the client side thing isn't too hard but maybe someone alread got the operators and style and handling for this: http://files.sven.bmonkeys.net/images/Finder-20130107-173804.png
[08:38:47] <Francis47> marcules: Perfect - thank you
[08:38:56] <marcules> np
[08:39:25] <aDatabase> hm, okay, my code is exploding on jsFiddle
[08:39:27] <aDatabase> gimme a minute
[08:39:56] <Francis47> is there a way to make sure the appended element is always directly below <head>?
[08:40:17] <marcules> you mean - like prepending it?
[08:40:29] <Francis47> im not sure..
[08:40:39] <marcules> ?prepend
[08:40:40] <bot-t1> .prepend(content, [content]): Insert content, specified by the parameter, to the beginning of each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/prepend/
[08:41:29] <Francis47> Doh
[08:41:36] <Francis47> marcules: Thanks again :)
[08:41:40] <marcules> ^^
[08:50:05] <jomofcw> hello !
[08:50:11] <jomofcw> Happy new year jQuery ^^ !
[08:51:08] <jomofcw> Is there a way to add data to an ajax request ? Currently I insert a hidden field to the form (which will be load over AJAX) on submit, but it's not a right way to do it imo :/.
[08:52:30] <jomofcw> I'm using jQuery form plugin.
[08:52:37] <marcules> jomofcw, you mean like sending get/post with the request itself?
[08:53:59] <jomofcw> marcules yea, but it's using jquery form plugin.
[08:54:51] <marcules> So "data" is not available?
[08:55:15] <jomofcw> marcules it is, but I cant replace it or it will not send the form data informations
[08:56:00] <bil`> Can I target something by jQuery selectors but use the native html5 drag and drop methods on it?
[08:56:12] <marcules> jomofcw, dunno
[08:56:39] <jomofcw> OK marcules I'm wrong xD... I can use data as you supposed and it will not replace but automaticaly add it :x.
[08:56:44] <jomofcw> RTFM to me
[08:56:53] <marcules> ^^
[08:57:42] <gxl> When using next(), does it only select the next sibling of the same type (ex: p tags only or divs only) or will it select the next sibling of any type (ex: mixing p tags, divs, etc)? Trying to get a selector for an adjacent (immediately following) item of a different type.
[09:00:23] <NoiseEee> gxl: you want http://api.jquery.com/next-siblings-selector/ or http://api.jquery.com/siblings/
[09:01:14] <gxl> NoiseEee: Looks like gold! Thanks.
[09:01:24] <gxl> Textual gold.
[09:01:39] <marcules> gxl, you can use next with and without restrictions
[09:16:11] <nickelnick> anyone here familiar with qtip?
[09:16:29] <hlve> yes. don't put them in your ears.
[09:16:34] <hlve> it says it right on the box!
[09:16:38] <nickelnick> lol
[09:16:51] <marcules> lol
[09:17:09] <nickelnick> i'm having problem with the tip placement.... some tips are not aligning with the middle of my <li>
[09:17:21] <nickelnick> why would this be? i don't see any conflicting css yet
[09:17:46] <tcstar> Is there a more efficient way to do pagination on tables than with the datatables plugin...  I have a table with 20462 entries, and it's taking forever to load that page
[09:18:14] <nickelnick> tcstar: well, you are loading 20462 entries and all to show right?
[09:18:21] <nickelnick> thats too many at once
[09:18:41] <nickelnick> you need pagination that works upon offset
[09:18:56] <tcstar> Default for the jquery datatables pagination is 10 per page
[09:19:10] <tcstar> but it doesn't work on the offset -- you have to get them all
[09:19:12] <nickelnick> i click on link page 1, it then grabs 100 limit at offset...x
[09:19:22] <nickelnick> really?
[09:19:27] <tcstar> Yeah
[09:19:33] <nickelnick> what about datatables.net
[09:19:44] <nickelnick> i use that, but i cant remember
[09:20:06] <tcstar> Thats the one
[09:20:16] <tcstar> I don't think it has an offset at all
[09:20:22] <nickelnick> no way...
[09:20:33] <nickelnick> oooh yea
[09:20:44] <nickelnick> it's all based on your html
[09:21:00] <nickelnick> your function should output the limited items...and accept an argument of the offset
[09:21:08] <nickelnick> datatables takes care of the rest
[09:21:23] <nickelnick> far as i remember
[09:21:51] <nickelnick> you really dont want any sort of sql command that has to load that many records even if not displaying
[09:22:15] <tcstar> Yes, but where datatables generates the page numbers based off of the amount of data there -- i'd have to rewrite it to accept a 'count' instead of reading the html
[09:23:17] <nickelnick> true, you would disable the paginator in datatables
[09:23:26] <nickelnick> you should use pagination with datatables
[09:23:31] <nickelnick> not datatables pagination
[09:23:40] <nickelnick> in your case
[09:24:25] <nickelnick> you need to only request what you need, at the time you need it
[09:25:48] <tcstar> So what you're saying is I need to rewrite the entire plugin to allow for that...
[09:26:11] <nickelnick> no
[09:26:20] <tcstar> otherwise, with the datatables plugin, it's not possible as it creates the number of pages on the fly... if i load say 10, it's 1 page.. no other pages display
[09:26:41] <nickelnick> what i'm saying is...disable the paginator on the datatables, as well as the amount of entries
[09:27:02] <nickelnick> this way, datatables uses your html structure to sort
[09:28:12] <nickelnick> but then you would need your php or whatever your link calls on when you click page 2. basically like /page/2 - but your method would know how many limit at once to grab, as well as the offset of a page 2, based on tthe limit at once
[09:29:28] <nickelnick> so, when page 2 loads....all the data from page1 is no longer existing, and it calls on offset (say 11, if 10 per page)
[09:29:47] <nickelnick> and then returns the array....you would then build your ul li out of the array
[09:29:48] <nickelnick> like normal
[09:29:53] <nickelnick> data tables would do the rest
[09:32:05] <tcstar> So, so re-invent the wheel
[09:36:16] <Typo> hi :)
[09:36:27] * Typo is confused and needs help
[09:36:32] <Typo> probably just lack of sleep
[09:36:34] <Typo> http://jsfiddle.net/2sN6P/
[09:36:55] <Typo> why no 'lala', only 'deedee' ..... lala should show first, its just not seeing that item in the list
[09:36:59] <Typo> local and jsfiddle does the same
[09:37:33] <lduros> hi, does jquery UI provide an "Ajax Loading" overlay out of the box?
[09:37:36] <lduros> can't find it in the docs
[09:37:44] <lduros> it's easy enough to do it with a bit of css and an image
[09:37:58] <lduros> but why do it when there's something thoroughly tested already >:)
[09:38:15] <bil`> does .on() support all of the nativee html5 events assuming the given browser support them?
[09:38:27] <tra> bil`: should do so
[09:38:58] <bil`> hmm dragstart is working but my drag enter event isnt
[09:39:18] <tcstar> for some reason $.inArray isn't reading that 5A3DD483-E332-949A-228B-136200A0AD78 is the issue...
[09:39:33] <Typo> i now tcstar, im lost as to why
[09:39:36] <Typo> it makes no sense to me
[09:39:38] <tcstar> I changed it to something else, and it works as intended...
[09:39:45] <Typo> i know it :)
[09:39:50] <tcstar> Yeah, it's weird I Couldn't tell you either lol
[09:40:02] <Typo> im so lost and i cant have it acting up when its live
[09:40:54] <tcstar> just added "", before it -- and it works.. so it's not seeing the first item in the array
[09:41:10] <bil`> nm.. misspelled a function name :P
[09:41:10] <Whiskey> if i have img {max-width: 790px} how do i change that value best whit jQuery
[09:41:17] <lduros> I guess this is fair enough for my question: http://jquery.malsup.com/block/#demos
[09:42:52] <Typo> I see the issue
[09:42:57] <Typo> thanks tc
[09:43:09] <Brodingo> Whiskey add a class
[09:43:21] <Typo> returns the position and position was 0 so looked false
[09:43:27] <Typo> easy fix once u see it
[09:43:29] <Typo> silly me
[09:44:29] <Brodingo> yeah you want !== -1
[09:44:40] <Brodingo> iirc
[09:44:46] <mahoski> Whiskey: $("#the-image").attr("max-width", newValue)
[09:45:11] <Brodingo> ummmmm no
[09:46:18] <mahoski> oops. $("#the-image").css("max-width", newValue)
[09:46:51] <Whiskey> well i just wanne change the img {
[09:46:58] <Whiskey> its not need to be a special one so it changed for all imgs
[09:47:44] <Brodingo> youre wanting to change a css rule?
[09:48:02] <Whiskey> yeh
[09:48:17] <Brodingo> probably not a good idea
[09:48:48] <b-ot> In Soviet Russia, css change you!
[09:49:47] <quijote> b-ot jaja.
[09:50:09] <b-ot> no, jaja U!
[09:50:26] <quijote> b-ot indeed
[09:51:18] <mahoski> Whiskey, then you want $("img").css("max-width", newValue)
[09:51:38] <Whiskey> yeh thats looks correct
[09:51:49] <quijote> actually I feel liek IE wants nothing more than to flash me in the most inapporpriate way. Anybody out there want to help me with a weird IE issue. Page loads fine in all browsers, validates but when viewed in IE some content wont load until I open developer toolbox. Then magically everythingw orks
[09:52:22] <Brodingo> something with console?
[09:52:44] <quijote> could it be?
[09:52:51] <quijote> dsiable console outout?
[09:52:55] <quijote> output*
[09:53:45] <quijote> oh shit your right
[09:53:59] <Brodingo> yay
[09:54:03] <systemfault> Heh… a classic error :P
[09:54:15] <Brodingo> what do i win
[09:55:06] <quijote> Humble am I, I offer more than the cloths on my back but less than the dirt they hold
[09:55:21] <quijote> I fyou live in california. I can get you some wine
[09:55:43] <Worstist> ;p
[09:55:54] <Worstist> hay pimps
[09:55:56] <quijote> I have a hookup
[09:55:57] <tcstar> People still support IE?
[09:56:02] <quijote> sadly
[09:56:06] <Worstist> yes man
[09:56:11] <tcstar> Wow -- I don't haha
[09:56:17] <Worstist> but we make it square edge divs for IR
[09:56:18] <Worstist> IE
[09:56:44] <tcstar> I have 1 IE CSS rule.. html { display: none; }
[09:56:44] <Worstist> IE users basicly see the 1993 version of site
[09:56:47] <Worstist> lol
[09:56:57] <Brodingo> #coolkids
[09:56:59] <quijote> jaja
[09:57:04] <Worstist> green background w yellow text
[09:57:28] <aDatabase> bleh
[09:57:44] <systemfault> Unfortunately… you cannot "not support" IE.
[09:57:45] <aDatabase> what's the best way to set a variable if shift is pressed, but revert it when you let go?
[09:58:05] <Worstist> what is IE doing for websites that use canvas
[09:58:13] <systemfault> aDatabase: Handling keyup/keydown + a variable?
[09:58:23] <vskants> g
[09:58:45] <systemfault> Worstist: IE9 supports canvas.
[09:58:58] <Worstist> o
[09:59:08] <Brodingo> and round things
[09:59:30] <Worstist> they used to have their own syntax for that
[09:59:46] <quijote> I celebrated too soon. IE still stupid
[10:00:03] <systemfault> quijote: Way too soon....
[10:00:14] <systemfault> IE8 will be supported for a long time..
[10:00:14] <quijote> jajaj
[10:00:18] <Worstist> those idiots thot they could force coders to use their syntax for that
[10:00:27] <quijote> my issue got fixed in ir 9 but still broken in ie 8
[10:00:29] <quijote> FML
[10:00:29] <Worstist> something someone else invented
[10:00:39] <Worstist> MS is fkn absurd
[10:00:48] <Stephen> Tjat
[10:00:53] <Stephen> That's what she said
[10:01:05] <Worstist> just dont buy windows
[10:01:13] <Worstist> theyll be dead in a few weeks
[10:01:18] <systemfault> Worstist: I'm not part of the problem… ;)
[10:01:24] <Worstist> lol
[10:01:34] <systemfault> Worstist: The problem is the 3x% of people who uses windows + ie.
[10:01:53] <Worstist> lool
[10:02:10] <Stephen> I helped lessen the problem by making our app cross-browser compat when I first got here
[10:02:15] <Stephen> Before it was IE only
[10:02:26] <Stephen> Horray me
[10:02:29] <Worstist> fuk
[10:02:34] <Stephen> Ok, where
[10:02:49] <Worstist> friken .net coders act like they own the planet
[10:02:54] <Worstist> and shit
[10:02:58] <Stephen> We do? How?
[10:03:22] <Worstist> iono cuz c# is compiled lang or something
[10:03:29] <Stephen> I'll admit to being a .Net coder, but it's not all I do.
[10:03:32] <Stephen> Ah, yeah
[10:03:37] <Worstist> yet it still renders slower than php
[10:03:42] <Worstist> when all put together
[10:03:43] <Stephen> \o
[10:04:15] <Stephen> For the record, page lifecycle is the biggest piece of shit known to man
[10:04:40] <Worstist> the problem w .net coders IS:
[10:04:46] <systemfault> None...
[10:04:50] <systemfault> And I'm not a .net coder
[10:05:01] <Worstist> they get sucked into this MS world
[10:05:08] <Worstist> world of wizards and
[10:05:16] <Worstist> automation
[10:05:33] <Stephen> .Net is great for a lot of things, but not everything
[10:05:33] <b-ot> Stephen, memorised “Net”.
[10:05:48] <Worstist> then they try to jam .mpeg videos into html
[10:05:59] <Worstist> and wonder y it no work
[10:06:21] <Worstist> ooo lets emped this mp3 in hear :D
[10:06:31] <Stephen> riiiight
[10:06:42] <Worstist> im srs
[10:06:45] <Stephen> Sorry, but no .Net developer wants audio in their site, EVER
[10:06:45] <Worstist> i seen it
[10:07:00] <systemfault> Personally, there's nothing worse than a PHP programmer..
[10:07:07] <Stephen> lol
[10:07:10] <Worstist> lol
[10:07:11] <systemfault> If such thing deserve the title of "programmer"
[10:07:14] <Worstist> wat bout python
[10:07:23] <systemfault> Python.. acceptable.
[10:07:27] <Stephen> Yup
[10:07:29] <systemfault> Less trashy
[10:07:30] <Worstist> wat bout c++
[10:07:36] <Worstist> or C
[10:07:42] <Stephen> C++ and C are necessary
[10:07:42] <systemfault> I wouldn't use them to do webpages..
[10:07:57] <Stephen> Javascript ftw
[10:08:07] <Worstist> well everyone knows js
[10:08:16] <systemfault> Worstist: I found the opposite...
[10:08:17] <Stephen> NodeJS brought us to full-class programmer status
[10:08:19] <systemfault> Nobody knows JS.
[10:08:20] <Worstist> true
[10:08:22] * ryanneufeld pokes the bee hive
[10:08:25] <ryanneufeld> What's wrong with PHP
[10:08:26] <ryanneufeld> ?
[10:08:33] <Worstist> not many ppl know proper HTML or CSS either
[10:08:51] <systemfault> I agree with you on that one.
[10:08:54] <Worstist> ryanneufeld: iam a php expert
[10:08:56] <aDatabase> I concur, PHP (if used correctly) can actually do OOP and that sort of thong
[10:08:59] <Ouchy> You trying to say its wrong to have everything in tables? o.0
[10:09:05] <Worstist> php is the best for web
[10:09:09] <Worstist> hands down
[10:09:21] <ryanneufeld> there is no best worst
[10:09:26] <Stephen> Every language has it's proper points
[10:09:27] <Worstist> sure ther is
[10:09:27] <systemfault> Worstist: I'd say easiest, not best.
[10:09:27] <ryanneufeld> it's about using the right tool for the job
[10:09:28] <aDatabase> Depends on the situation. :p
[10:09:32] <Worstist> just like c++ is best for games
[10:09:37] <Stephen> I haven't found a use for Scala yet, but I'm sure it's there
[10:09:40] <ryanneufeld> systemfault: some would say easiest is best
[10:09:53] <Worstist> php is same easyness as the rest
[10:10:05] <Worstist> maybe ur jus dum
[10:10:25] <Worstist> scala is a POS c++ rip off
[10:10:27] <Worstist> thats slow
[10:10:32] <systemfault> what?
[10:10:36] <Worstist> y da fuk wud u use it
[10:10:40] <Worstist> what u mean what
[10:10:40] <systemfault> I don't like scala..
[10:10:42] <ryanneufeld> Worstist: you're not exactly displaying intelligence by using "ur just dumb"
[10:10:46] <systemfault> But it's really fast
[10:10:50] <Worstist> scala is a VM c++ wanabe
[10:11:05] <Worstist> its realy not
[10:11:29] <systemfault> And also.. it as close to C++ as an apple is close to a tomato
[10:11:43] <Worstist> which is close
[10:11:54] <systemfault> Beside both begin programming languages… they have nothing in common.
[10:12:05] <systemfault> *being
[10:12:13] <RohanBhangui> which two?
[10:12:20] <Worstist> systemfault: dont hurt yourself
[10:12:20] <systemfault> RohanBhangui: C++ and Scala
[10:12:35] <Worstist> scala is a VM c++ wanabe
[10:12:41] <Worstist> big deal
[10:13:11] <Worstist> scala able?
[10:13:29] <Worstist> anyhow
[10:13:37] <Worstist> everything will be c++ in the future
[10:13:44] <systemfault> You look like a PHP programmer..
[10:13:50] <systemfault> That's for sure.
[10:14:02] <ryanneufeld> systemfault: Do i?
[10:14:40] <systemfault> ryanneufeld: You haven't said anything stupid so far… so you could be one… or just a programmer who happens to write PHP for work (Like me)
[10:14:57] <Worstist> systemfault: shut ur tra[
[10:15:09] <Worstist> u think ur the main nerd here
[10:15:16] <Worstist> cause ur name is systemfault
[10:15:18] <ryanneufeld> systemfault: you're painting with a broad brush, likely in an attempt to insult and troll people.
[10:15:26] <systemfault> Worstist: I have no problem with that….
[10:15:28] <Brodingo> sure is jquery in here
[10:15:31] <Worstist> ya hes a dik
[10:15:39] <ryanneufeld> systemfault, Worstist it's over as of now
[10:15:43] <ryanneufeld> back to #jquery
[10:15:50] <systemfault> ryanneufeld: No problem.
[10:15:59] <Worstist> systemfault: ill spank u in jquery
[10:16:03] <Worstist> back to front
[10:16:06] <ryanneufeld> Worstist: drop it
[10:16:10] <ryanneufeld> last warning
[10:16:29] <Worstist> :D
[10:26:52] <Whiskey> jsfiddle.net/e8u8s/26/ whats wrong on that syntax
[10:26:56] <Whiskey> its not loading correct
[10:31:15] <jQueryTom> hi all
[10:31:29] <jQueryTom> whats crackin?
[10:31:34] <Goopyo> Can someone tell me whats wrong wit this? http://pastie.org/private/glbvoesidwjqets7upg
[10:31:51] <Goopyo> console.log(value) is right,  but it keeps showing server
[10:31:56] <Goopyo> I dont think the delay is working
[10:32:42] <Brodingo> url isnt loading but delay is for animation queue
[10:33:00] <Brodingo> otherwise use setTimeout
[10:33:30] <jQueryTom> Goopyo
[10:33:45] <jQueryTom> setInterval doesnt starting
[10:33:56] <jQueryTom> what are u get?
[10:34:05] <Goopyo> Heres a mirror: http://pastebin.com/WgLabNNr
[10:34:31] <jQueryTom> Goopyo
[10:34:33] <Goopyo> Brodingo: I used set interval too
[10:34:43] <Goopyo> the delay is for within the loop
[10:34:46] <jQueryTom> try to use jsfiddle.net
[10:34:52] <jQueryTom> so i can run and debug it
[10:35:24] <jQueryTom> goopyo doesnt matter
[10:35:29] <jQueryTom> delay is just a queue
[10:35:37] <jQueryTom> which i run after some time
[10:36:04] <Goopyo> http://jsfiddle.net/D75KT/
[10:36:32] <Goopyo> Updated to use jquery: http://jsfiddle.net/D75KT/1/
[10:37:02] <Goopyo> I jus twant a continuous rotation of the word_list via a slide in slide out
[10:37:07] <Brodingo> its doing them all at once so you jsut see the last one
[10:37:34] <Goopyo> Yeah. So what exactly does the 'delay' do?
[10:37:44] <Brodingo> it delays an animation
[10:38:12] <Brodingo> but youre calling it at the same time as many times as there are keys
[10:38:17] <Brodingo> so it just shows the last one
[10:38:21] <jQueryTom> Goopyo
[10:38:29] <jQueryTom> delay is creating a queue which
[10:38:37] <jQueryTom> i run in FIFO
[10:38:42] <Goopyo> can I delay the foreach?
[10:38:48] <jQueryTom> well is executing immediately
[10:39:09] <skamikaze> ?setTimeout @ Goopyo
[10:39:10] <bot-t> Goopyo, var timeout = window.setTimeout(function, delayMs) - Executes a code snippet or a function after specified delay. https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/window.setTimeout - cancel with window.clearTimeout(timeout);
[10:39:13] <jQueryTom> then it run ater some ms next function in the queue
[10:39:44] <saedelaere> I have a process in PHP which may last for some time. I wanted to display the progress using jQuery. What is the best way to communicate about the progress between PHP and jQuery?
[10:40:24] <jQueryTom> Goopyo its working
[10:40:25] <FernandoBasso> http://www.azevedosalomaoimoveis.com.br/imoveis/ I need some help. If you click on "Terraplanagem e Aluguel de Máquinas", it gives an error (seen on firebug).
[10:40:30] <jQueryTom> for me
[10:40:34] <jQueryTom> i just run it
[10:40:42] <jQueryTom> but select jquery framweork
[10:40:48] <Goopyo> jQueryTom: which one?
[10:40:59] <jQueryTom> http://jsfiddle.net/D75KT/
[10:41:15] <systemfault> saedelaere: I guess I would return "Accepted(202)" right away and return some url I could poll every X seconds with ajax
[10:41:16] <Goopyo> Its not for me
[10:41:20] <jQueryTom> oh
[10:44:54] <saedelaere> systemfault: one more thing to consider is, that the PHP process is not started using jQuery. But nevertheless I will have to poll some URL, read a file, read DB or whatever to get the progress
[10:45:20] <systemfault> saedelaere: Right
[10:45:24] <saedelaere> connecting js and php is not easy sometimes
[10:45:30] <saedelaere> systemfault: thanks :)
[10:47:28] <Goopyo> How about this one: http://jsfiddle.net/D75KT/2/
[10:50:21] <Goopyo> I think I got it
[10:52:07] <arthur_> Hello.
[10:52:47] <arthur_> I try to set a data-count-theme on a single bubble count in a listview. Is it possible ?
[10:53:42] <arthur_> data-count-theme on a li doesn't seem to work
[10:54:05] <eugenmayer> what would be your best guess creating an achor out of an arbitary (spaced) string?
[10:57:16] <arthur_> sorry, bug. Didn't see if someone answer to my question ?
[11:11:01] <hyshai> why does focusout event fire when moving focus to descendant element - only happens in IE tho?
[11:11:05] <hyshai> example: http://jsbin.com/ufacan/6/edit
[11:23:54] <gxl> Having some trouble using .next(). I have 4 a tags followed by divs and am trying to .show() the div immediately following the <a> that was clicked, but it's doing .show() on all the divs instead of just the next. Ideas? http://pastebin.com/HZZ9cps0
[11:24:31] <Zitter> hi, why doesn't it work? http://jsfiddle.net/XFYBQ/
[11:25:49] <jQueryTom> gxl use jsfiddle.net
[11:26:10] <jQueryTom> generally
[11:26:23] <jQueryTom> use $(e.target).next()
[11:26:28] <jQueryTom> show()
[11:28:14] <gxl> I was selecting the wrong thing. Needed to do: $(this).next().show();
[11:28:37] <gxl> Seems to work now.
[11:33:16] <jQueryTom> good
[11:33:24] <jQueryTom> always use jsfiddle.net
[11:33:40] <jQueryTom> or jsbin.com
[11:34:07] <DoctorMonocular> hey everyone, having a weird issue -- I am trying to use the my/at position arguments to set an autocomplete's position to be above the textbox. It's sort of working except that it thinks the textbox is in the wrong place (something like [0,5000] which is all t he way to the left and roughly 100px above where the box actually is. I'm confused because the box is fully rendered when the position is set and it's
[11:34:08] <DoctorMonocular> position:static so I can't imagine what's going on
[11:35:58] <jQueryTom> give it the jsfiddle
[11:36:00] <jQueryTom> Doctor
[11:36:35] <DoctorMonocular> yeah I was afraid you were going to ask that, I'm not sure I can… gimme a few minutes to try to separate it out (it's in a big rails project…)
[11:36:39] <jQueryTom> give me html
[11:36:52] <jQueryTom> ok so just give me skielet
[11:36:56] <jQueryTom> not all code
[11:37:10] <jQueryTom> u know pseudocode
[11:37:31] <jQueryTom> Doctor dont worry
[11:37:58] <DoctorMonocular> working on it, one sec
[11:38:31] <jQueryTom> oki doki
[11:38:54] <ddd> http://jsfiddle.net/3TuUL/
[11:39:28] <ddd> jQueryTom: DoctorMonocular and I are working together. sorry for the delay. I was doing the fiddle
[11:42:15] <ddd> Screencap of what it looks like is at http://note.io/XEy6uD   If we change to my "left bottom" ; at "left top" it moves it to the correct spot but does what DM was saying. That code just showed our last attempt to play with position
[11:43:40] <jQueryTom> ok wait
[11:43:59] <jQueryTom> but what effect u wolud like to achieve
[11:44:20] <jQueryTom> that in the evernoe
[11:44:23] <jQueryTom> is wrong?
[11:46:22] <jQueryTom> ddd?
[11:46:24] <Cameron_> is there a way to pin a draggable element so that i can remove the surrounding elements without it moving?
[11:46:56] <DoctorMonocular> so, that's he shot of it dropping down correctly. But we want it to "drop up"  -- he'll get a shot one sec
[11:47:04] <DoctorMonocular> *the shot
[11:47:47] <jQueryTom> u mean tha the list should be above the input
[11:47:48] <jQueryTom> ?
[11:48:02] <ddd> http://note.io/XEzBJp
[11:48:05] <DoctorMonocular> right, because ithe input is near the bottom of the screen
[11:48:15] <ddd> updated screencap with our 'correct' settings
[11:48:18] <DoctorMonocular> there's the shot of what it does
[11:48:21] <jQueryTom> listen
[11:48:29] <jQueryTom> why u dont use a cssy
[11:48:33] <jQueryTom> to position it
[11:48:38] <jQueryTom> without js
[11:48:44] <jQueryTom> u dont need js
[11:48:49] <jQueryTom> to do it
[11:49:19] <jQueryTom> just wrap the input in a some div
[11:49:25] <jQueryTom> add position reltive
[11:49:27] <jQueryTom> to it
[11:49:41] <jQueryTom> and then add position absolute to the dropped list
[11:49:47] <DoctorMonocular> huh. Maybe that's a good idea -- I mean, we don't really know hte height of the box, but we could do some work arounds
[11:49:50] <jQueryTom> then use top/bottom
[11:49:54] <jQueryTom> Doctor
[11:49:56] <jQueryTom> i told u
[11:50:06] <jQueryTom> not maybe thats IDEA
[11:50:25] <aDatabase> +1 for position:absolute + top/bottom CSS
[11:50:30] <DoctorMonocular> so the real question though, for future reference is, why doesn't jquery .position() get the right position for this elements?
[11:50:37] <jQueryTom> use the top properties of the absolute
[11:50:38] <jQueryTom> box
[11:50:41] <DoctorMonocular> *this element
[11:50:45] <Boze> i know .html adds something to an element. but how do I strip out the first div in the body or add it back in ?
[11:51:14] <Boze> firstchild something?
[11:51:53] <jQueryTom> Boze i dont understand u
[11:51:56] <jQueryTom> sorry
[11:52:13] <ddd> ok, we can do the work-around as suggested. however, the question does stand. why doesn't jquery .position() get the right position for this element?
[11:52:34] <jQueryTom> ddd
[11:52:38] <jQueryTom> dont bother with it
[11:53:07] <ddd> ok, we can fob it off to css. but that doesn't explain the actual problem. thats what we're asking. is this a failing in jsquery or what
[11:53:07] <jQueryTom> when u really dont need use of js
[11:53:50] <monk3y> Boze: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3324622/jquery-this-and-selector-thisfirst-child-csscolor-red
[11:54:33] <monk3y> But instead of changing the css, once you've 'selected' the first child of the body tag, throw it in a variable and do what you want with it.
[11:54:45] <Boze> hmm
[11:57:52] <iman> are there any way to disable load() cache ?
[11:58:21] <jQueryTom> yup
[11:58:26] <jQueryTom> u must to
[11:58:51] <jQueryTom> foeeach on img and check if is copleted
[11:58:59] <jQueryTom> and trigger it manually
[11:59:12] <jQueryTom> u can return it by php
[11:59:18] <jQueryTom> or add timestamp
[11:59:19] <NoiseEee> jQueryTom: so you're on IRC via a phone that limits your characters to 100 per entry?
[11:59:22] <jQueryTom> at the end
[11:59:23] <redblacktree> does $(this) have a different meaning inside of a success callback (i.e. on $.ajax())?
[11:59:29] <redblacktree> I'm not finding elements I expect to find.
[11:59:37] <jQueryTom> Noise ;>
[12:00:47] <systemfault> iman: You could use a classic cache buster...
[12:01:08] <iman> systemfault: what is it?
[12:01:10] <systemfault> iman: Like adding a timestamp at the end of the filename as a query string param
[12:01:49] <iman> systemfault: i add Math.random(), and my request sends to server but i still gave last page
[12:01:52] <systemfault> ?js "/lol/foo/rofl.jpg?ninja=" + +(new Date());
[12:01:53] <bot-t> systemfault: "/lol/foo/rofl.jpg?ninja=1357588882340"
[12:01:55] <redblacktree> this works: data: $(this).closest('form').serialize(), -- but the same expression inside of the success function doesn't give me the same element.
[12:02:04] <systemfault> iman: Hmm, weird
[12:02:06] <jQueryTom> red
[12:02:07] <jQueryTom> .each(function(i,domElem){
[12:02:08] <jQueryTom> if(domElem.complete == true || domElem.readyState == "complete" || domElem.readyState === 4 ){
[12:02:08] <jQueryTom> $(this).trigger("load");
[12:02:08] <jQueryTom> }
[12:02:08] <jQueryTom> });
[12:02:34] <jQueryTom> red
[12:02:42] <jQueryTom> u should and a load event
[12:02:49] <jQueryTom> on the img but only onece

[12:04:03] <jQueryTom> systemfault
[12:04:08] <jQueryTom> look above
[12:04:14] <jQueryTom> u ha ve the answer
[12:04:25] <systemfault> I didn't have a question :/
[12:04:39] <jQueryTom> oh sorry
[12:04:43] <jQueryTom> iman
[12:05:01] <bil`> So I'm messing with some drag and drop to order a list. For some odd reason only when I drag Box 1 will it invoke addDropSpaces() and toggleDropStyles(). Lil help? http://jsfiddle.net/zGSpP/5/
[12:05:13] <systemfault> jQueryTom: Still a nice snippet :)
[12:05:28] <NoiseEee> jQueryTom: seriously, stop typing one/two words and hitting enter. its super annoying to read and it borders on flooding.
[12:05:56] <jQueryTom> Noise ok sorry
[12:06:47] <shoky> redblacktree:  var self = this;  $.ajax({..success:function(data) {  $(self).whatever.. }})
[12:07:09] <shoky> redblacktree:  'this' changes all the time between function calls
[12:07:20] <shoky> or might change
[12:07:23] <redblacktree> ok, so it is what I suspected.  Thanks for the solution!!
[12:07:32] <redblacktree> I had seen that kind of thing before
[12:07:45] <redblacktree> but I assumed that it was Python developers preferring to look at a familiar syntax
[12:07:55] <redblacktree> it sounds like a silly explanation now that I type it out :)
[12:09:56] <bil`> so um.. no one dares take a peak at my fiddle to aid me? It has Anchorman references :P
[12:10:35] <redblacktree> works perfectly.  Thanks again, shoky
[12:10:48] <jeffsmykil> Ayone have any experience with handlebars block helperes?
[12:10:50] <jeffsmykil> helpers
[12:11:11] <jeffsmykil> was wondering if you could access the iterator from inside of the {{#each}}
[12:12:30] <marksteele> hey, suppose I have a flot object that has an element inside it that has a class 'legend', how can I return that element?
[12:12:55] <bil`> $(el).find('.legend')
[12:12:57] <marksteele> legend = plot.$('.legend'); <— something like this
[12:13:06] <marksteele> ah
[12:13:07] <marksteele> thanks
[12:13:14] <jQueryTom> ;>
[12:13:29] <jQueryTom> i love that channel
[12:13:32] <jQueryTom> really
[12:13:38] <jQueryTom> love u ppl;)
[12:20:15] <suppp> how can i select an element inside of another element. not using id's, but when i mouse over the parent element, i'd like to modify the opacity of a child element. i need something that runs the query only inside the element returned by a query : https://gist.github.com/4478047 . any thoughts ?
[12:22:17] <jQueryTom> event bubble
[12:23:05] <jQueryTom> suppp but if u bind(mouseenter) on the parent and then in the event handler
[12:23:13] <jQueryTom> find desc elem?
[12:24:22] <suppp> hmm not sure i understand what you mean, but i did find the "find" function , didnt know about it , so trying to see what i can get acomplished with that, first gotta convert my code from cofeescript to js so i don't run into trouble that way :)
[12:24:37] <jQueryTom> $(e.target).closest(desc)
[12:25:36] <hlve> jQueryTom, whens the new site going live?~ >:/
[12:25:52] <suppp> thanks jQueryTom will have a look at your suggestion
[12:26:12] <bil`_> suppp: $(this).find('.menu').css(..)
[12:26:41] <suppp> thanks guys, makes sense, trying it out now
[12:27:19] <jQueryTom> suppp but the element thai is inside covers all his parent?
[12:27:38] <jQueryTom> if not use bil suggestion
[12:28:02] <suppp> jQueryTom : no , it's one element out of many . so yess what bil`_ was suggesting looks great
[12:28:05] <jQueryTom> on parent attach event handler mouseenter and then find the element inside
[12:28:17] <jQueryTom> okej
[12:29:03] <suppp> yea thanks got it to work , tx jQueryTom and bil`_
[12:29:38] <bil`_> also hover kinda sucks, I generally try to use on() and bind mouseenter and mouseleave excplicityly so you can use event delegation
[12:29:41] <MoTiOnXml> is it possible to create an empty jQuery() object (i.e. set), that I can add elements to, as I create them?
[12:29:53] <MoTiOnXml> $().add($("<div />")) doesn't work
[12:30:12] <bil`_> MoTiOnXml: you need to have a DOM element you're adding them to
[12:30:15] <jQueryTom> $({})
[12:30:19] <jQueryTom> here u go
[12:30:21] <arthur_> I try to set the data-count-theme for only one li in the listview. Can you help me ?
[12:30:46] <aDatabase> okay, got a problem here: trying to get my elements to be draggable, but lock horizontal or vertical axis while I'm holding Shift or Alt, respectively. Problem is, my code is passing JSLint but stopping the drag from working: http://jsfiddle.net/wzWKf/1/
[12:30:58] <MoTiOnXml> jQueryTom: testing ..
[12:31:04] <jQueryTom> ok
[12:31:41] <arthur_> set data-count-theme on the li doesn't work for me :/
[12:32:22] <MoTiOnXml> jQueryTom: nopes, the jQuery i'm creating (and adding) are not found in the resulting set
[12:32:34] <drdoe> oh hey when did the new jquery site launch? it looks good
[12:32:37] <MoTiOnXml> jQueryTom: v1.6.3 here (unfortunately)
[12:33:01] <jQueryTom> if u already add a div then u sholud to sotre it to variable i guess
[12:33:11] <jQueryTom> on manipulate on it
[12:33:14] <MoTiOnXml> i don't have a div, i want an entire new result
[12:33:50] <jQueryTom> ok but after u create/add a div what are u doing
[12:33:51] <jQueryTom> ?
[12:34:55] <MoTiOnXml> jQueryTom: after i create a div, i want to add it to a resulting jQuery set (which is empty initially)
[12:35:09] <jQueryTom> and then?
[12:35:22] <MoTiOnXml> then return it :)
[12:36:00] <jQueryTom> like this  return $({}).add($('<div/>')); ?
[12:36:20] <MoTiOnXml> looks like it, yes
[12:36:26] <jQueryTom> hmm its strange
[12:36:31] <hyshai1> why does focusout event fire when moving focus to descendant element - only happens in IE tho?
[12:36:36] <jQueryTom> maube chane the {} to []
[12:36:39] <MoTiOnXml> i'm adding the element to the dom before adding it to the resulting set
[12:36:43] <MoTiOnXml> already tried the []s
[12:36:56] <hyshai1> Run example in IE http://jsbin.com/ufacan/6/edit
[12:36:59] <jQueryTom> and ?
[12:36:59] <systemfault> Just use an array...
[12:37:09] <aDatabase> okay, fixed that and updated my code - I'm now wondering how to get lines 2 and 6 to refer to the class my draggable is acting on?
[12:37:13] <aDatabase> http://jsfiddle.net/wzWKf/2/ (sorry)
[12:37:18] <MoTiOnXml> jQueryTom: same result
[12:37:20] <MoTiOnXml> hang on
[12:37:25] <jQueryTom> damn
[12:37:27] <jQueryTom> strange
[12:37:38] <jQueryTom> maybe update to jq1.8
[12:37:47] <jQueryTom> but it should work
[12:37:51] <jQueryTom> anyway
[12:41:45] <jQueryTom> Motion im using jq1.8
[12:41:49] <jQueryTom> and it works
[12:42:23] <MoTiOnXml> jQueryTom: yea, i'd like to go to 1.8, but the client is already using 1.6.3 all over and we're 3 weeks to deadline :)
[12:42:36] <jQueryTom> oh
[12:42:40] <MoTiOnXml> jQueryTom: i just came on to the project to help the team :)
[12:42:51] <MoTiOnXml> but agree, 1.8 would be a lot better - and i pushed
[12:42:51] <jQueryTom> bu cant u load new version
[12:42:55] <jQueryTom> host it
[12:43:21] <MoTiOnXml> sure, but i just made a quick fix - did a .children() selection on the parent element i was adding to and returned that selection
[12:43:30] <MoTiOnXml> it's a small data set
[12:44:51] <Cameron_> is there a way to pin a draggable element so that i can remove the surrounding elements without it moving?
[12:45:05] <jQueryTom> motion
[12:45:13] <jQueryTom> so add that alem t oarray
[12:45:14] <jQueryTom> array
[12:45:16] <jQueryTom> raw
[12:46:11] <redblacktree> "The .replaceWith() method, like most jQuery methods, returns the jQuery object so that other methods can be chained onto it. However, it must be noted that the original jQuery object is returned. " -- How do I get ahold of the new object?
[12:46:32] <shoky> MoTiOnXml:  .add doesn't update the original
[12:46:41] <shoky> MoTiOnXml: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/njsL6/
[12:47:20] <redblacktree> never mind, I'm a dummy.  I had the object when I passed it to replaceWith() didn't I? :)
[12:47:23] <systemfault> redblacktree: You already have it… since you're passing it to the function?
[12:47:28] <systemfault> Heh...
[12:47:31] <redblacktree> lol thanks, systemfault
[12:47:47] <redblacktree> it's too early in the day for this kind of thinking!
[12:48:34] <drdoe> ll
[12:49:53] <MoTiOnXml> shoky: thanks for the info :)
[12:57:12] <aDatabase> I'm sorry, I'm still confused - how do I get my script to check for key presses while it is being dragged? http://jsfiddle.net/wzWKf/3/
[13:03:02] <codezombie> getting a weird issue with jquery inside a live binding for a click event. When the click fires, the hide doesn't happen. Further investigation shows a strange object. Would someone mind taking a look at this object? I can provide the full object if needed. https://gist.github.com/c515093025ab8da694e2

[13:34:55] <xjjk> hrm, why is #jquerymobile +i (invite only)?

[14:04:03] <mistapink> hi, I'm a bit puzzled. how can I retrieve private data from a custom widget? I have tried this: http://jsfiddle.net/hdLHL/ but it doesnt find the method
[14:05:14] <monk3y> mistapink: I can't see any javascript in there :/
[14:06:43] <mistapink> monk3y: it shows here. I've updated it
[14:07:43] <monk3y> I still can't see it.  It must be a PEBKAC issue on my end.  Sorry I couldn't help.
[14:08:37] <mistapink> monk3y: thx anyway
[14:15:42] <sufian> Hey guys.
[14:18:20] <motox> when using delegate, what would the trigger be for when a button is pressed down?  'click' is not what I want because that only tells me when the mouse was button was released
[14:18:28] <sufian> I have a load event which I will be setting to onclick "$('#a').load('article.html');" with an interval of 3secs however I want it to stop reloading every 3 secs once a change is detected in the  'article.html' file how do i go about doing this?
[14:19:04] <nickelnick> you want to use $.ajax for this not load probably
[14:19:27] <Stephen> use the $.magic
[14:19:33] <Stephen> it does anything you want
[14:19:40] <Stephen> including documentation
[14:20:36] <Stephen> using $.magic() infers what you're trying to do by looking at DOM placement and other included scripts
[14:21:05] <Stephen> The only thing it wont work with is $.troll()
[14:21:39] <sufian> is there a way to stop setInterval?
[14:21:48] <Gho5t> clearInterval
[14:21:50] <MistuhKurtz> clearInteval sufian
[14:21:50] <Gho5t> bam
[14:22:02] <sufian> Thanks
[14:23:43] <Stephen> snagnever, wtf is up my man?
[14:23:50] <Stephen> How's your mom been?
[14:24:10] <snagnever> wtf?
[14:24:27] <LessSeen> she's good
[14:24:58] <Stephen> It's been a while.... we need to catch up more....
[14:25:07] <Stephen> Maybe not quite as many drinks this time though
[14:25:11] <Stephen> ;-)
[14:25:17] <snagnever> teenagers discoverd freenode
[14:25:22] <Stephen> lol
[14:25:34] <Stephen> Nah, I'm 32... just in a troll mood
[14:25:36] <sufian> Whats the best method of checking if a file that is being loaded on interval has been changed setInterval(function() {$( ".result" ).load( "ajax/test.html" );}, 3000); ?
[14:26:02] <Stephen> sufian: I think there is a progress API that's used for that now
[14:26:23] <Stephen> Oh, wait, changed
[14:26:27] <Stephen> not loaded, my bad
[14:26:32] <pachet> sufian: um
[14:26:44] <pachet> i mean the only way to know for sure is to compare the full responseText
[14:26:51] <Stephen> Agreed
[14:27:02] <Stephen> Is there any way to check if the load came from cache?
[14:27:11] <Stephen> If so that'd be the best shortcut
[14:27:17] <pachet> you can check for a 304 not modified header
[14:27:24] <sufian> the load set on interval is outputting a number.
[14:27:24] <Stephen> There you go
[14:27:30] <Stephen> Check for a 204
[14:27:33] <Stephen> er, 304
[14:27:42] <pachet> well, you'd check for *not* a 304
[14:27:44] <Stephen> If it's staying the same, it'll be a 304
[14:27:51] <pachet> ^

[15:06:29] <coldhead> my fucking spine
[15:10:41] <monk3y> coldhead: how does one 'do their spine' while coding?  You have a nasty jQuery conflict issue you had to debug .. vigorously?
[15:11:59] <coldhead> i guess i just have poor ergonomic furniture
[15:12:08] <coldhead> i don't really ever do any jQuery
[15:13:08] * yogurt_truck has been coding standing up for about 10 months now
[15:13:13] <naeluh> could some one take a look at bxslider ? I am getting 2 prev and next appearing for some reason ? its located here http://theconfluencegroup.com/new_site4/#a
[15:13:22] <naeluh> I feel like there should only be one ?
[15:13:30] <naeluh> its in the about section
[15:13:48] <naeluh> I ripped the code directly from the plugins website
[15:14:45] <naeluh> I psoted an issue on github but I see that its not happening on the website so I am little confused as to why it would be happending on my site
[15:14:48] <coldhead> yogurt_truck: never going back? standing up is a lot of work
[15:18:03] <coldhead> naeluh: you seem to be including some of your .js files more than once
[15:18:19] <coldhead> that seems a likely culprit
[15:18:51] <naeluh> coldhead: ok which one did you see ?
[15:19:01] <coldhead> i saw plugins.js included twice
[15:19:05] <coldhead> then i stopped looking
[15:19:50] <naeluh> coldhead: thanks its plugins and plugins2
[15:19:53] <naeluh> there not the same
[15:20:26] <coldhead> they're*
[15:20:49] <naeluh> yo right sorry about that
[15:22:44] <coldhead> okay, my new theory is that you can't have more than one bxslider on a page
[15:22:59] <coldhead> because it inserts its controls into a div with an ID
[15:23:03] <coldhead> and IDs must be unique
[15:23:17] <coldhead> so i guess it's using that same element for the Next/Prev controls for each instance
[15:23:30] <yogurt_truck> coldhead: First couple of weeks were an absolute nightmare. But I've gotten used to it, to the point where nowadays sitting down feels weird.
[15:24:21] <shoky> you can have more than one bxslider, but don't set both their nextSelector to the same element:     nextSelector: '#slider-next',
[15:24:24] <shoky> naeluh ^
[15:24:44] <naeluh> shoky
[15:25:24] <coldhead> shoky: you are the wind beneath my wings
[15:25:59] <naeluh> shoky: thanks I do have different selector I think let me chcek
[15:26:05] <naeluh> check
[15:26:38] <shoky> dumdedum
[15:26:56] <naeluh> shoky: yeah they are different
[15:27:14] <shoky> naeluh:  what are different?
[15:27:31] <naeluh> the selectors for the prev and next buttons
[15:27:40] <shoky> naeluh: you have two elements with class="bxslider1"
[15:27:55] <shoky> naeluh: so $('.bxslider1').bxSlider({...})  will create two bxsliders
[15:28:20] <shoky> both of them will use the same #slider-next and #slider-prev  to put their NEXT and PREV links in
[15:29:46] <naeluh> you got it I left an old slider in there that I forgot about sorry for the dumb question
[15:30:11] <shoky> np
[15:30:21] <shoky> coldhead likes them
[15:31:52] <naeluh> thanks
[15:31:53] <monk3y> I'd still eat an old slider.
[15:32:00] <monk3y> Sorry </lurking>
[15:32:07] <naeluh> haha
[15:32:46] <monk3y> Since moving to North America; sliders, poutine and most corporate bar&grills will be the death of me.
[15:33:20] <hyshai> are there any known issues with "focusout" being fired too fast in IE?
[15:33:25] <hyshai> example - http://jsbin.com/ufacan/7/edit
[15:34:54] <hyshai> monk3y: but what do you think of poutine queens?
[15:35:10] <monk3y> I have *no* idea what that/they is/are.
[15:35:19] <monk3y> But I fear I want to *be* one.
[15:35:30] <hyshai> just a joke - canadian slang for gay men
[15:35:34] <D3X_> mmm poutine
[15:36:14] <shoky> this is the first i hear of poutine
[15:36:25] <shoky> looks greasy and potentially yummy
[15:36:35] <shoky> plz gimme
[15:37:03] * monk3y sets mode: un-type on post "I want to *be* one"
[15:37:26] <hyshai> hahaha
[15:37:27] <monk3y> Although, heh, there is a restaurant called that in Toronto;
[15:37:27] <monk3y> The truck is painted an attention grabbing bubblegum pink
[15:37:38] <monk3y> ^ that's a description from a foodie review.
[15:37:55] <monk3y> (not pachet .. pachet's not the description .. but YKWIM)
[15:39:18] <monk3y> shoky: you gotta try poutine man.  It's 76.6666% the reason I moved to Toronto.
[15:40:54] <coldhead> so monk3y is in TO...
[15:40:57] * coldhead takes notes
[15:41:02] <shoky> heh, i'll try to remember if i'm ever in the area ;p
[15:41:08] <monk3y> haha
[15:41:14] <systemfault> Oh yeah, back to Poutine talk.
[15:41:20] * monk3y makes notes while watching the cameras that record coldhead taking notes
[15:41:27] <hyshai> can anyone help me with my IE issue?
[15:42:32] <monk3y> hyshai: I had a quick look but couldn't immediately see what the problem was.  Which v of IE are you seeing a problem?
[15:42:40] <hyshai> IE9
[15:42:56] <hyshai> the on click event for #save is supposed to fire
[15:43:37] <hyshai> when you click on save button just fires focusout (even tho it's a descendant?) and not onclick
[15:44:02] <hyshai> works perfectly in webkit and moz
[15:44:02] <sheilablackrose> hello
[15:44:31] <monk3y> sheilablackrose.  Greets.
[15:45:20] <sheilablackrose> how r u guys
[15:45:24] <sheilablackrose> how ws new year
[15:46:21] <shoky> old
[15:46:30] <monk3y> Mine was enebriated.  Year-counters incremented.  Did some things I regret.  Made resolutions I'll actively avoid to achieve.
[15:46:47] <sheilablackrose> sounds like a plan :)
[15:46:57] <sheilablackrose> my resolution was to start gym
[15:47:02] <sheilablackrose> i registered but havent gone
[15:47:07] <sheilablackrose> at least im payig for it
[15:47:10] <systemfault> :/
[15:49:11] <monk3y> sheilablackrose: Well your bank account's losing weight.
[15:49:49] <oojacoboo> how would I go about storing an object in a data attr within html?
[15:49:51] <sheilablackrose> true
[15:49:58] <oojacoboo> does it have to be json encoded first?
[15:50:21] <oojacoboo> basically I'm prepending an html string, and I want to store a data object iwth it
[15:50:30] <systemfault> oojacoboo: Yeah… but the whole concept is a bit hackish
[15:50:39] <oojacoboo> systemfault: that's what I thought
[15:50:50] <systemfault> You're sure there's no other alternatives?
[15:51:08] <oojacoboo> systemfault: can I take a string and jq-ify it and attach a data element?
[15:51:40] <oojacoboo> var string = "<div>foo</div>"; string.data("bar", myObj);
[15:51:50] <oojacoboo> $(string).data...
[15:52:19] <systemfault> oojacoboo: .data doesn't attach to the HTML attributes
[15:52:32] <oojacoboo> systemfault: that's fine
[15:52:44] <oojacoboo> it adds it to the jquery object of the DOM node though, no?
[15:52:45] <systemfault> I mean, you can stock objects with data
[15:52:49] <systemfault> No
[15:52:53] <monk3y> oojacoboo: what do you want the resultant html to look like?
[15:52:56] <systemfault> Hmm
[15:53:02] <oojacoboo> monk3y: I don't care about the html
[15:53:07] <systemfault> Well, yeah.. but not with an attribute IIRC
[15:53:07] <oojacoboo> I just need an object stored with a DOM element
[15:53:24] <shoky> .data('myObj', someObj)
[15:53:29] <shoky> what's all the fuss
[15:53:35] <systemfault> oojacoboo: IIRC, it adds a jQuery_SOMEID8234782384  member to the dom node.
[15:53:44] <shoky> he doesn't seem to care about that
[15:53:53] <oojacoboo> yea, that's cool
[15:54:02] <monk3y> ooOOOoooh .. I didn't know you could store arbitrary data in the jQuery DOM.
[15:54:05] <oojacoboo> but can I do this on a string that's not in the DOM
[15:54:12] * monk3y sets mode: +n00b on localhost
[15:54:33] <oojacoboo> I'm pretty sure I can, but that's a string, not an object, so...
[15:54:46] <oojacoboo> of course, js treats strings as object literals, IIRC
[15:54:52] <shoky> what do you mean.. "do this on a string"
[15:54:59] <oojacoboo> var string = "<div>foo</div>"; string.data("bar", myObj);
[15:55:03] <sheilablackrose> is there a tripple state checkbox?
[15:55:04] <oojacoboo> $(string)
[15:55:11] <shoky> uhh
[15:55:14] <oojacoboo> sheilablackrose: with jquery ui maybe
[15:55:16] <oojacoboo> not in html
[15:55:25] <shoky> var myObj = {myString: 'bla', myData: {whatever} }
[15:55:30] <shoky> what does jquery have to do with that
[15:55:35] <oojacoboo> shoky: nothing
[15:55:40] <systemfault> A triple state checkbox would be radio buttons..
[15:55:54] <monk3y> A triple-state checkbox would be a rad- d'oh.
[15:56:34] <sheilablackrose> haha
[15:56:39] <monk3y> *or* your own 3 icons that loop through different images that represent each state, then as you click them they change the value of a hidden field.
[15:56:46] <oojacoboo> shoky: thanks man, I see how I'm gonna do this
[15:57:06] <sheilablackrose> but that would require all the logic which uses jquery to retrive th estate of checked check boxes down the drain
[15:57:36] <oojacoboo> I think :/
[15:58:08] <shoky> oojacoboo: you can do..  var foo = $('<div>foo</div>');  foo.data(whatever,whaetver);
[15:58:25] <shoky> oojacoboo: if you want a jquery object for that new div, that is
[15:58:30] <oojacoboo> shoky: yea, that's what I was getting it
[15:58:33] <oojacoboo> yea
[15:58:50] <oojacoboo> then prepend(foo); would work, correct?
[15:58:59] <shoky> yup
[15:59:03] <oojacoboo> yea, cool
[16:01:11] <shoky> is jquery-ui 1.9 menu adequate for right-click context-menus ?
[16:01:18] <shoky> stupid question i guess :\
[16:01:28] <shoky> but ANSWER IT
[16:01:59] <oojacoboo> why not build something faster :P
[16:02:12] <shoky> it's slow?
[16:02:14] <sheilablackrose> is there away to do it without disturbing my current logic
[16:02:15] <sheilablackrose> ?
[16:02:22] <oojacoboo> shoky: well, I can't imagine it being fast
[16:02:29] <shoky> how come
[16:03:09] <sheilablackrose> which most of it does stuff like $(input [checkbox:checked])
[16:03:10] <shoky> and.. what do you mean by slow
[16:03:10] <shoky> well, fast
[16:03:10] <oojacoboo> shoky: I mean, anything with that much functionality built into it isn't going to be that efficient
[16:03:10] <shoky> wut
[16:03:10] <b-ot> i have noticed there are many plugins that sometime i could need
[16:03:10] <oojacoboo> but I haven't tested it, so I'm just guessing
[16:03:15] <shoky> that doesn't make much senese
[16:03:45] <oojacoboo> I dunno, I guess I'd never use a jquery menu
[16:03:49] <oojacoboo> ui*
[16:04:03] <shoky> it's for a project already using jquery-ui anyway
[16:04:14] <oojacoboo> a simple event handler for right click and a show-hide should suffice
[16:04:19] <oojacoboo> ah, gotcha
[16:04:22] <shoky> sure, show-hide
[16:04:49] <shoky> bleh nvm i'll stop being lazy
[16:04:56] <oojacoboo> heh
[16:09:34] <b0ss_> can someone tell why the heck does facebook still use Flash rather than jQuery ?
[16:09:50] <oojacoboo> for file uploads?
[16:12:12] <EyePulp> anyone here used knockoutjs along w/ jquery
[16:12:13] <EyePulp> ?
[16:12:25] <EyePulp> b0ss_: IE6?
[16:12:33] <oojacoboo> EyePulp: no
[16:12:48] <oojacoboo> and if it's file uploads it's b/c xhr2 support sicks
[16:12:50] <oojacoboo> sucks*
[16:12:58] <oojacoboo> < IE9!
[16:13:06] <oojacoboo> <= IE9!
[16:13:57] <b0ss_> oojacoboo: I didn't know IE8 and IE9 were that poorly coded and demanding Flash !
[16:14:14] <oojacoboo> they don't support xhr2
[16:14:25] <oojacoboo> and the iframe file upload hack isn't as flexible
[16:16:12] <sheilablackrose> hey guys is nandos better or kenny rogers?
[16:16:17] <oojacoboo> yes!!
[16:16:18] <shoky> EyePulp: yeah
[16:16:33] <oojacoboo> sheilablackrose: nandos
[16:16:40] <shoky> EyePulp: i do KO + jquery all the time
[16:16:40] <oojacoboo> where do you live?  I thought there was only one in the US
[16:17:24] <sufian> is there a way to  save .load value in .data
[16:17:39] <shoky> sufian: yes
[16:17:57] <shoky> assuming by .load value  you mean the loaded content
[16:18:16] <EyePulp> shoky: I'm using it for the first time today - been through the tuts, but it's still not natural.  Have you been happy with the results using it?
[16:19:01] <shoky> EyePulp: yep
[16:20:08] <b0ss_> <oojacoboo> they don't support xhr2 => so does it make unable for FB to move completely to HTML 5 ?
[16:20:16] <oojacoboo> yes
[16:20:28] <oojacoboo> for at least 5 years
[16:21:10] <oojacoboo> shoky: do you really have to put your events in the DOM? http://knockoutjs.com/examples/clickCounter.html
[16:21:13] <oojacoboo> that's gross
[16:22:42] <shoky> oojacoboo: i find it nice, but anyway you don't HAVE to do it like that, there are ways to do it "unobtrusively" and have it all in your JS code
[16:22:57] <oojacoboo> cool
[16:23:05] <oojacoboo> I haven't gotten into these frameworks yet really
[16:23:15] <shoky> it's not like you're putting any code in the html
[16:23:16] <oojacoboo> haven't had a chance, but I like backbone
[16:23:36] <shoky> but it does tie the html to the JS somewhat, but i find that a good thing in most cases
[16:23:43] <sufian> shoky: Sorry I was AFK back now yes I mean load content.
[16:24:04] <oojacoboo> shoky: yea, I guess, you just have to start looking at two files constantly
[16:24:16] <shoky> sufian: the loaded content will be the .html()  of the element, so you can store that into .data() upon complete of the .load
[16:24:19] <oojacoboo> I guess if you get use to it it's ok
[16:24:40] <sufian> shoky: thanks
[16:25:02] <shoky> oojacoboo: what's nice about it, is that lets say i have some div with an event handler:  <div data-bind="click: doSmth">
[16:25:18] <shoky> oojacoboo: and then if i wanna move this div, i just move it, and it still has the same event handler bound to it
[16:25:35] <shoky> oojacoboo: if it was all in the JS using selectors or whatever, i'd need to update the selector, would still need to look in both files, etc..
[16:25:38] <sheilablackrose> australia
[16:25:40] <sheilablackrose> its everywhere
[16:25:44] <oojacoboo> yea, I'm never really moving DOM elements like that
[16:25:47] <oojacoboo> but I know what you mean
[16:26:27] <oojacoboo> sheilablackrose: there is only one in the US and Kenny Rogers is from my home town, I didn't know those were in Oz
[16:26:48] <sheilablackrose> awesome
[16:27:16] <oojacoboo> sheilablackrose: I developed a 50 page business plan for a Nandos copy cat for the US
[16:27:27] <oojacoboo> never pulled the trigger on it...
[16:27:29] <coldhead> mmm nandos
[16:28:00] <sheilablackrose> what about the indeterminate state attribute? can i use that as a tri checkbox?
[16:28:17] <sheilablackrose> oojacoboo why
[16:28:19] <b0ss_> with 1/7 of humanity on FB I doubt very they want to improve something to the state of art soon!
[16:28:22] <sheilablackrose> extra hot is a killer
[16:29:04] <oojacoboo> sheilablackrose: it's complex, but I even spoke with a large franchise company that was on the same page that pushed out peri peri chicken and fish franchise, and they screwed it up big time
[16:29:27] <oojacoboo> regardless, my partner and myself at the time, we just didn't make it happen for one reason or another, I don't think we were ready
[16:29:46] <oojacoboo> it's still primed for the US though ;)
[16:30:04] <sheilablackrose> cant i do something like this .tagCheckbox:indeterminate + label {
[16:30:04] <sheilablackrose> 	background-image: url("images/mp_check_blue_on_yesBack.png");
[16:30:25] <oojacoboo> sheilablackrose: that's not cross browser
[16:30:41] <oojacoboo> http://caniuse.com
[16:31:22] <sheilablackrose> what do you mean
[16:31:22] <sheilablackrose> ?
[16:31:26] <oojacoboo> never even heard of that pseudo selector
[16:31:57] <systemfault> The + ?
[16:32:02] <sheilablackrose> i have this it works .tagCheckbox:checked + label {
[16:32:07] <sheilablackrose> but i need to make it a tri checkbox
[16:32:14] <sheilablackrose> so i read about the indeterminate state
[16:32:15] <systemfault> Doesn't work on ie6.. static on ie7
[16:32:19] <sheilablackrose> now im wondering how to manipulat eit
[16:32:19] <oojacoboo> systemfault: that's not a pseudo selector
[16:32:24] <systemfault> I know.
[16:32:27] <oojacoboo> k
[16:32:39] <systemfault> Pseudo selectors are :something
[16:32:45] <oojacoboo> ya
[16:33:02] <oojacoboo> ::sometimes
[16:33:12] <oojacoboo> although, not sure if those are technically pseudo selectors
[16:34:54] <systemfault> pseudo-elements
[16:35:10] <systemfault> ::before and ::after
[16:35:35] <oojacoboo> thanks for clarifying :)
[16:35:37] <systemfault> But i don't know anyone who use the :: version
[16:36:02] <systemfault> (As all browsers support :before/:after)
[16:36:30] <oojacoboo> iakno
[16:38:16] <tw2113> they support it for legacy support only
[16:38:17] <tw2113> but good luck getting everyone to the :: version
[16:38:17] <tw2113> too many sites would break if they removed single colon syntax, and it wouldn't be an easy debug
[16:53:16] <sheilablackrose> i have an array myarray. how can i get only the distinct value? in c# there somthing like myarray = myarray.distinct()
[16:53:23] <sheilablackrose> is there similar functuion in jquery
[16:54:52] <danzik171> sheilablackrose: in jquery, no.  other utility libraries ( underscore / lodash ) have things like that - http://underscorejs.org/#uniq
[16:56:54] <sheilablackrose> ic
[16:57:29] <sheilablackrose> so how would i get the disntinct value alone?
[16:57:55] <oojacoboo> sheilablackrose: you can use underscore's pluck
[16:58:01] <oojacoboo> _.pluck
[16:59:27] <danzik171> sheilablackrose: what do you mean "the" distinct value?  after using _.uniq, each element in the array should be considered distinct
[17:00:35] <sheilablackrose> can u give me an example on jsfiddle
[17:00:42] <sheilablackrose> using _.uniq
[17:01:08] <oojacoboo> sheilablackrose: http://underscorejs.org/#uniq
[17:01:12] <oojacoboo> example there
[17:01:45] <sheilablackrose> tq
[17:02:45] <sheilablackrose> in my jqeury i dont have that function
[17:02:49] <sheilablackrose> i only have _uniqueId
[17:02:53] <oojacoboo> omg
[17:02:57] <monk3y> Heheh

[17:24:58] <sufian_> Hey anything wrong with this statement? var creditgrabbed2 = $('.creditgrabbed2').html();
[17:25:18] <systemfault> Nope.
[17:25:34] <oojacoboo> the number of that var sucks
[17:26:30] <sufian_> sorry missed abit anything wrong with this?   $('.creditgrabbed').load('api.php?user=5');  var creditgrabbed = $('.creditgrabbed').html();
[17:26:51] <oojacoboo> sufian_: no
[17:26:56] <sufian_> because creditgrabbed does not seem to output anything :(
[17:26:57] <oojacoboo> except that url api.php might be wrong
[17:27:04] <oojacoboo> check the response
[17:27:09] <sufian_> api does output something.
[17:28:57] <systemfault> Learn how the A in AJAX works.
[17:29:01] <systemfault> (The first A)
[17:29:06] <danyp> sup nerds^^
[17:30:08] <systemfault> .load takes a callback as its second/third parameter
[17:33:01] <danyp> what is better
[17:33:11] <danyp> jQuery or Javascript or AJAX
[17:33:34] <danyp> or actionScript ?

[17:34:04] <danyp> hmm
[17:34:07] <danyp> then for design

[17:37:57] <danyp> he said he uses the newest HTML 4
[17:37:57] <oojacoboo> as comical as this is...
[17:38:15] <danyp> oojacoboo: thank you very much for the info
[17:38:21] <oojacoboo> ryanneufeld: why you not doing your job

[17:39:14] <bot-t> coldhead, Okay.
[17:42:24] <mmlac> Why does $().css ignore my transition property when I use it in the website but it works when I use it (the same code) in firebug?
[17:42:49] <oojacoboo> $() ?
[17:42:52] <mmlac> $('#emailSignupForm').css("opacity", "1");
[17:43:18] <oojacoboo> mmlac: b/c of when/how it's called?
[17:43:33] <mmlac> It is called on a click event
[17:43:46] <oojacoboo> can you console.log("foo"); on click?
[17:43:48] <mmlac> I click:  instant opacity=1
[17:44:12] <mmlac> It is triggered, otherwise the opacity would not change
[17:44:21] <mmlac> it changes instantly. Instead of fading
[17:44:24] <Cronoh> animate?
[17:44:35] <oojacoboo> mmlac: oh, yea, you need to animate it
[17:44:36] <mmlac> Well, why animate when CSS already declares the animation
[17:44:40] <mmlac> wtf?
[17:44:46] <oojacoboo> .css() just sets the style
[17:44:53] <mmlac> The animation works perfectly in Firebug
[17:45:02] <mmlac> If I embed it in the source, if makes it instant
[17:45:16] <oojacoboo> .testcase
[17:45:18] <coldhead> alert('Please paste this code into Firebug: ...')
[17:45:19] <mmlac> css for the element is:  transitn:  1s;

[17:49:56] <kristopolous> has anyone here ever used yFiles for HTML or have an opinion on it?
[17:53:06] <mmlac> this:  http://jsfiddle.net/XpKDE/   oojacoboo
[17:59:43] <oojacoboo> mmlac: http://jsfiddle.net/XpKDE/1/
[18:00:02] <Fallout2man> erm, quick Q, but lets say I have to write a page that has to go in a rather obnoxious wrapper I can't change. I need to figure out how to create a delegated event method to rid myself of page elements it wishes to inject into my page. Would $('body div').on('load', '.class-to-check-for', function(event) { $(this).remove(); }); work?
[18:00:19] <mmlac> yes, I know how to use animate. This does not explain the difference between Firebug and inline
[18:00:34] <Fallout2man> Or would I need to use another event to check for when it attempts to perform DOM injection?
[18:00:41] <shoky> mmlac: it's because of the 'display' manipulation
[18:00:47] <oojacoboo> ok well, you're aware that css transitions aren't even remotely cross browser, right?
[18:00:56] <mmlac> they are cross browser enough
[18:01:00] <oojacoboo> lol
[18:01:01] <oojacoboo> wrong
[18:01:04] <mmlac> I don't care about IE 6
[18:01:11] <oojacoboo> or IE8?
[18:01:15] <mmlac> so?
[18:01:15] <oojacoboo> or 9 too, I think
[18:01:16] <shoky> mmlac: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/XpKDE/2/
[18:01:18] <oojacoboo> ok
[18:01:19] <oojacoboo> w/e
[18:01:23] <Fallout2man> Only IE 10 is ACID 3 compliant
[18:01:25] <mmlac> It's a minimal UI feature
[18:01:29] <mmlac> nothing anybody cares about
[18:01:33] <Fallout2man> ACID 3 was written what, almost ten years ago?
[18:01:35] <mmlac> hence -> I don't care about IE
[18:01:39] <oojacoboo> showing something is minimal?
[18:01:42] <oojacoboo> ><
[18:01:55] <Fallout2man> But anyway, back to my original question.
[18:01:59] <mmlac> shoky: hm, thanks!
[18:02:03] <Fallout2man> Does jQuery's Load event catch DOM manipulation?
[18:02:16] <Fallout2man> As in will the browser signal to it that there's a new div in the page?
[18:02:28] <shoky> Fallout2man: no
[18:02:31] <mmlac> oojacoboo: The show occurs anyway. Just not animated.  *end useless discussion*
[18:02:36] <Fallout2man> shoky: any way to do this?
[18:03:02] <shoky> Fallout2man: do whatever you want when you're adding the new div to the page
[18:04:34] <Fallout2man> shoky: That's the thing it's not me adding the div. It's the wrapper that the "Viewer" app I use injects my content into.
[18:05:01] <mmlac> shoky your response lead me to another answer on StackOverflow. Thanks again, I didn't think about display braking transitions :D
[18:05:03] <mmlac> breaking*
[18:05:04] <shoky> Fallout2man:  there's no good cross-browser way to just get notified of new elements in the dOM or something like that
[18:05:06] <Fallout2man> shoky: I can't change the wrapper, so I was hoping to just find a way to catch its DOM injection somehow.
[18:05:22] <Fallout2man> curses! ;_; Thanks man
[18:05:27] <shoky> np mmlac
[18:05:29] * Fallout2man returns to zee drawing board
[18:12:34] <shoky> btw mmlac: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/XpKDE/3/
[18:13:11] <mmlac> lol. Thanks so much!
[18:13:12] <shoky> did you find the root reason for that behaviour? seems buggish
[18:13:27] <mmlac> No, I just would have used height:0
[18:13:33] <mmlac> instead of the display
[18:13:35] <shoky> heh
[18:13:37] <mmlac> but that worlds even better
[18:13:40] <mmlac> thanks again!
[18:13:58] <shoky> ;]
[18:18:29] <oojacoboo> this seems strange to me, I'm gettng back an ajax response object, and b/c it's a 404 the backend does a redirect, but if I output this in our error container, it loads the entire redirected page
[18:18:46] <oojacoboo> whereas logging the response, just shows the actual error
[18:19:10] <oojacoboo> I'm catching the exception where I expect the response to be json
[18:19:18] <sufian> Hey, I am trying to get content from .load  using .html but it's not working any ideas?
[18:19:23] <oojacoboo> then I'm throwing the response back at the error container
[18:19:28] <shoky> oojacoboo: which handler is running? success or error?
[18:19:35] <oojacoboo> neither
[18:19:36] <oojacoboo> well
[18:19:47] <oojacoboo> shoky: this isn't exactly jquery $,ajax
[18:19:52] <shoky> o
[18:20:10] <oojacoboo> I just didn't realize a response object could persist like that
[18:20:47] <shoky> nothing you said was really clear to me ;p
[18:21:04] <oojacoboo> ajax request returns a response object
[18:21:28] <oojacoboo> b/c it's a 404, our js is set to actually redirect the url
[18:21:53] <shoky> "our js" ? server or client?
[18:21:57] <oojacoboo> client
[18:22:03] <shoky> what does that mean..
[18:22:12] <oojacoboo> but that's on hash change
[18:22:27] <shoky> it gets a 404 so it loads a different url instead?
[18:22:29] <oojacoboo> on hash change if it's not able to locate the url, it redirects
[18:22:47] <oojacoboo> right, but that's not really part of this response object from an ajax request
[18:22:59] <oojacoboo> that logic shouldn't be related
[18:23:12] <shoky> no idea what response object you're talking about.. if it's not $.ajax
[18:23:31] <oojacoboo> yea, it's just an object that carries the response from the request
[18:23:51] <oojacoboo> somehow there isn't a copy made of it or something
[18:24:20] <oojacoboo> so the object persists like any request and when it's put into the DOM, it's firing everything else with it
[18:24:42] <shoky> each sentence you say confuses me even more ;]
[18:24:47] <oojacoboo> :/
[18:25:34] <tw2113> oojacoboo, have you fiddled anything?
[18:25:46] <oojacoboo> tw2113: not really doable here
[18:27:21] <shoky> at first you said "the backend does a redirect"
[18:27:24] <shoky> then you said its the client
[18:27:34] <oojacoboo> shoky: yea, I misspoke, sorry
[18:27:46] <oojacoboo> it's clientside js
[18:27:47] <shoky> then you talk about an ajax response object, that.. persists? and its put into the DOM? wha..?
[18:28:26] <oojacoboo> yea… well… I'm kinda in the same boat honestly… wha?
[18:28:42] <shoky> what did you mean by "it's put into the DOM" ?
[18:28:45] <oojacoboo> https://gist.github.com/4480545
[18:28:57] <oojacoboo> https://gist.github.com/4480549
[18:30:35] <oojacoboo> showNotice is just a div that is passed html
[18:30:45] <oojacoboo> the entire site ends up getting loaded into that
[18:30:53] <oojacoboo> which is a redirected url
[18:30:58] <shoky> response.response is an html string?
[18:31:10] <oojacoboo> yes
[18:31:53] <shoky> well then .. youre not putting any object in the DOM
[18:31:59] <shoky> just copying a string
[18:32:01] <oojacoboo> no
[18:32:07] <oojacoboo> but the object persists somehow
[18:32:13] <shoky> meaning?
[18:32:14] <oojacoboo> the contents of which are put into the dom
[18:32:21] <oojacoboo> shoky: I honestly don't know
[18:32:35] <oojacoboo> I feel like the object, the request should die or be stale on a response
[18:32:35] <shoky> also, why are you _.clone()ing it
[18:32:49] <oojacoboo> shoky: to try and kill the persistence
[18:32:53] <oojacoboo> didn't work
[18:32:58] <shoky> what persistence ;S
[18:33:24] <oojacoboo> well, all objects are passed by ref in js, right
[18:33:45] <shoky> yea
[18:33:47] <oojacoboo> so, if a request is made in js and the object is carried on, all the way to the point where I am with it
[18:34:00] <oojacoboo> then it would make sense that it would do all the things that a typical response would do in the browser
[18:34:08] <oojacoboo> I somehow think jquery handles this for you
[18:34:23] <shoky> wat..
[18:34:23] <b-ot> i've tested and same behavior in Dojo, ExtJS, Mootools ... your antispam system sux
[18:34:30] <shoky> responses don't do anything
[18:34:33] <oojacoboo> by killing the initial object and preserving the object at the response state
[18:38:33] <shoky> shrugs
[18:38:33] <b-ot> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[18:46:52] <oojacoboo> return fireError("Error. Invalid server response.");

[19:08:23] <fission6> is there a obvious / typical reason why something like $('div.countdown').text((100 / idArgumentsArray.length) * (index + 1) + '%'); wouldn't update the ui until after some other thread finished
[19:08:40] <fission6> not thread but something else potentially blocking
[19:09:36] <fission6> it seems to work in ff but in chrome the ui isn't updated to much later
[19:10:02] <coldhead> that's very strange
[19:10:20] <coldhead> is there some kind of wacky CSS on that element which might make chrome reluctant to mess with it?
[19:10:44] <coldhead> in which case maybe you could force a reflow?
[19:12:09] <fission6> nothing to weird
[19:12:14] <fission6> nothing really weird at all

[21:20:43] <TehNrd> I've got a question about $(this) within the context of plugin options that I've been struggling with for past hour and I'm hoping someone can help...
[21:21:10] <TehNrd> $("#someElement").fieldSelector({
[21:21:10] <TehNrd>        'someOption': $(this) //I expected this to be the #someElement object but it is not, appears to be document object,is this expected?
[21:21:10] <TehNrd> });
[21:22:12] <coldhead> it won't be #someElement at that point, no
[21:22:42] <coldhead> inside a function or inside the plugin then yes, it might do that
[21:23:08] <coldhead> but in the code you have there you're just calling the plugin with some params
[21:23:17] <coldhead> so `this` is still whatever it is at that point
[21:23:21] <coldhead> window, probably
[21:23:31] <TehNrd> yup it is,
[21:23:45] <coldhead> i'll show you how to do what i think you're trying to do
[21:23:50] <coldhead> and it will probably dissuade you
[21:24:52] <TehNrd> haha ok...
[21:25:22] <coldhead> http://jsfiddle.net/MRmay/
[21:25:30] <TehNrd> for each element the plugin is attached to I'd like the user to be able to traverse away from that attached element to some thing else on the page
[21:25:37] <coldhead> that's using each() just to put whatever is selected into this
[21:26:35] <TehNrd> ya…not really like the idea of calling the plugin alot but that is an option
[21:26:38] <coldhead> and this is a slightly less offensive way to keep from having to select that element http://jsfiddle.net/MRmay/1/
[21:30:34] <TehNrd> i may just allow the user to create a function where the argument is me passing back the original element the plugin was attached to...
[21:31:11] <TehNrd> $("#someElement").fieldSelector({
[21:31:12] <TehNrd> 	'isFilter': function(e){
[21:31:12] <TehNrd> 		return element.attr('foo');
[21:31:12] <TehNrd> 	}
[21:31:12] <TehNrd> });
[21:31:12] <TehNrd> in plugin loop
[21:31:13] <TehNrd> var bar = settings.isFilter( $(this) );
[21:31:57] <TehNrd> in the plugin loop $(this) will be the #someElement
[21:34:54] <coldhead> that's a nice flexibile solution, TehNrd
[21:35:22] <codilechasseur> I'm trying to mimic an iPhone text message interface with divs being pushed to the bottom of the window and pushing all other divs up? Anyone have any ideas how I could go about that?
[21:36:05] <TehNrd> coldhead, thanks for letting my bounce ideas off of you to validate the other way wasn't really an options

[22:32:18] <shoky> i want my poutine
[22:39:59] <Hans_Henrik> what logic is behind the name ".eq" btw?
[22:40:45] <Hans_Henrik> if i had to guess what function to use, it would be .res or something like that, don't really see what ".eq" is supposed to mean ("equals"?)
[22:40:46] <greg5green> no idea, just always assumed it meant equal to
[22:40:55] <greg5green> you know, mathy
[22:42:46] <coldhead> it's a reference to george orwell's animal farm
[22:42:55] <coldhead> "some are more equal than others"
[22:43:08] <coldhead> you're choosing which one is more equal than the others
[22:43:14] <Whiskey> http://jsfiddle.net/e8u8s/28/ whats wrong in the syntax here, the JS don´t work, the code in the HTML part work fine do

[22:44:14] <coldhead> Whiskey: you seem to be declaring a function called tableWidth but you never actually call it
[22:44:16] <Eviltwin> Whiskey: Why is there a double children.each?
[22:44:35] <Eviltwin> This should actually run it: http://jsfiddle.net/e8u8s/29/
[22:44:52] <Eviltwin> Or this: http://jsfiddle.net/e8u8s/30/
[22:45:22] <greg5green> I might even go this far: http://jsfiddle.net/e8u8s/31/
[22:45:38] <greg5green> (although with that function moved in one tab stop)
[22:46:12] <Eviltwin> Why not just $(document).ready(tableWidth) then?
[22:46:31] <Whiskey> no cue naaa i thinked it look nicer
[22:46:58] <someprimetime> Eviltwin: what's your opinion on AMD?
[22:47:00] <greg5green> in response to me eviltwin?
[22:47:20] <someprimetime> @coldhead too
[22:48:16] <someprimetime> i started using require.js but i'm just realizing that i'm going to be concatenating and minifying anything anyway so i'm not sure wtf i'm getting out of it aside from having modules load when they're needed
[22:49:29] <coldhead> i don't use any of those things someprimetime but AMD is popular with people i respect and widely used
[22:50:35] <Whiskey> Eviltwin: thx
[22:51:44] <someprimetime> coldhead: word
[22:52:06] <danheberden> someprimetime: some might say the organization of code is worth it
[22:52:11] <danheberden> having modules you can require and test
[22:52:22] <someprimetime> danheberden: i've actually been finding that the best part actually
[22:52:24] <danheberden> and having each file loaded by require js in your development environment
[22:52:30] <someprimetime> i've structured my templates nicely as well
[22:52:34] <danheberden> and then minified in the end
[22:52:38] <Eviltwin> AMD looks like a good pattern
[22:52:39] <danheberden> so that when youre hunting bugs
[22:52:52] <danheberden> it's much easier to find in file C instead of line 4523 of one big file
[22:53:00] <danheberden> and you don't have to deal with the file shit
[22:53:00] <Eviltwin> Honestly I'm really bad with names for these patterns
[22:53:07] <danheberden> just have a redirect for require.js on your server
[22:53:17] <Eviltwin> I use them and understand them but never associate the name with them
[22:53:32] <Whiskey> Eviltwin: can you not go in in the function if it is "$(document).ready(function (tableWdith) {" and then use onclick or whatever
[22:54:11] <Eviltwin> I... I don't follow
[22:54:18] <danheberden> why would the argument of the function passed into $(document).ready be 'tableWdith'
[22:54:22] <Eviltwin> Don't use the HTML attributes for event handlers though
[22:54:27] <danheberden> the argument given in that case is jQuery itself
[22:54:27] <greg5green> no Whiskey
[22:54:28] <Eviltwin> <a onclick="..."> is bad
[22:54:32] <Eviltwin> Evil in fact
[22:55:09] <someprimetime> Eviltwin: it's the last pattern stoyan whateverhislastnameis uses in javascript patterns
[22:55:10] <greg5green> I don't think he actually wants to use onclick
[22:55:12] <greg5green> prolly just click
[22:55:29] <greg5green> but when you put function(tableWidth) {
[22:55:51] <greg5green> you arent calling the function tableWidth, you are trying to pass the undeclared variable tableWidth to that anonymous function
[23:00:07] <Whiskey> hmm

[23:21:33] <aqeel> sometthing like this
[23:25:20] <someprimetime> i mean the code is right there
[23:25:22] <someprimetime> http://remysharp.com/demo/mousehold.js
[23:25:28] <someprimetime> you could just read it
[23:27:13] <RET> i bound a clickevent to a target element but the event fired is incomplete (no pageX / pageY etc). i cannot reproduce this in a fiddle :( any hints where to start?
[23:28:10] <coldhead> RET: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5926123/get-the-raw-event-from-jquery
[23:28:43] <someprimetime> $('#button').click(function(evt) { console.log(evt.pageX); });
[23:28:55] <someprimetime> oh and add pageY in there
[23:28:58] <Hans_Henrik> wait, they mess with the events aswell?
[23:29:08] <Hans_Henrik> i always asumed jQuery didnt mess with that :o
[23:29:14] <RET> originalEvent is undefined
[23:29:18] <someprimetime> huh?
[23:29:39] <Hans_Henrik> how does jQuery change the event object?
[23:30:56] <coldhead> jquery copies a subset of properties
[23:31:02] <RET> tried $('.rglink').click(function(evt) { console.log(evt.pageX); }) but it just prints "undefined"
[23:31:06] <someprimetime> jquery wraps it
[23:31:06] <RET> no idea why :(
[23:31:17] <someprimetime> adds it's sugar to it
[23:31:23] <coldhead> evt.originalEvent.pageX ?
[23:31:31] <someprimetime> RET's link just gives you what the browser would give you without jquery if you want it
[23:31:34] <coldhead> that worked for me, back in the 60s, which was the last time i needed it
[23:31:38] <Hans_Henrik> pageX
[23:31:45] <Hans_Henrik> whats that even supposed to be?
[23:31:51] <someprimetime> damn coldhead you look good for your age
[23:31:51] <coldhead> mouse-coords
[23:32:02] <Whiskey> i try to do if($(".divid").css("display", "none") {
[23:32:08] <Whiskey> divid is a variable
[23:32:12] <coldhead> thx bb, i owe it all to ground up monkey spines
[23:32:19] <Whiskey> and i think that it not read it
[23:32:26] <someprimetime> do you import them from China?
[23:32:42] <coldhead> depends on the exchange rates and such
[23:32:52] <coldhead> south america has been good to me lately
[23:33:09] <someprimetime> Whiskey: try if ($('.divCLASS').is(':visible')) { // see me now }
[23:33:17] <someprimetime> haha
[23:33:44] <RET> ok, found a possible reason
[23:33:59] <someprimetime> i'd like some south american weather right about now
[23:34:01] <RET> i have a link in the table row and trigger a click if clicking the row
[23:34:14] <RET> if i click the link directly it works
[23:35:05] <coldhead> RET: http://jsfiddle.net/CKtXK/
[23:35:31] <RET> coldhead: this will work
[23:35:32] <RET> if (!$(e.target).is('a') && !$(e.target).closest('a').length)
[23:35:32] <RET> $('.rglink',this).triggerHandler('click');
[23:35:33] <coldhead> `w sydney australia
[23:35:38] <RET> this is what i do before
[23:35:46] <coldhead> ah good old e.target
[23:35:47] <RET> and this shrinks the event
[23:35:57] <coldhead> `w sydney australia

[23:38:00] <Whiskey> if($(".divCLASS").is(":divid").css("display", "none")) {<--
[23:38:48] <someprimetime> i give up
[23:39:22] <RET> coldhead: how do i pass the original event to triggerHandler?
[23:42:03] <mulch2> Quick question for you elite: I have a search box, which I'm using jquery to validate the input to make sure it's no less than 6 characters.
[23:42:12] <mulch2> if ($('input[name="s"]').val().length < 6)
[23:42:17] <mulch2> using that^
[23:42:49] <mulch2> My question is how do I add to that something that will make sure that the input follows a certain format: 2 letters followed by 4 numbers
[23:43:11] <greg5green> regex
[23:43:31] <Hans_Henrik> mulch2: fair warning, don't use "change" event if you want to support old IE/XP users
[23:43:45] <Hans_Henrik> not even in jQuery
[23:43:54] <mulch2> Okay
[23:44:04] <Hans_Henrik> and dont use the "input" event either
[23:44:20] <Hans_Henrik> mousedown/mouseup events are very reliable in IE tho :p
[23:44:40] <Hans_Henrik> ah no not those 2 wtf
[23:45:19] <Hans_Henrik> keyup / keydown are reliable, even in IE*
[23:45:21] <coldhead> RET: originalEvent should be a property of the event passed to the handler
[23:45:34] <coldhead> if you're trigger()ing an event then there is no originalEvent
[23:45:45] <coldhead> because you're faking it
[23:45:51] <RET> yeah, that is the problem :(
[23:46:07] <coldhead> why is that a problem? what originalEvent property do you need in a fake event?
[23:46:18] <RET> i want to trigger a link klick in a table row
[23:46:32] <RET> the ajax loader should appear next to the mouse
[23:46:51] <RET> ive done this in the links click function, based on the event.pageX
[23:47:13] <RET> but as you stated, the faked event does not have any data from the original event
[23:47:37] <mulch2> thanks, Hans, btw!
[23:47:57] <mulch2> and greg5green
[23:48:29] <mulch2> The $input thing is working so well -- are you saying I should change it?
[23:48:43] <mulch2> Took me forever to finally get something working
[23:49:06] <RET> i guess i extract the function and bind it to both (tr & a) and prevent the tr event if clicked on the link (within the tr)
[23:49:29] <RET> thanks for investigations @coldhead
[23:50:15] <coldhead> RET: you COULD just bind something to the mousemove event which keeps track of the mouse position and use those co-ordinates within the fake trigger event
[23:50:39] <coldhead> i hate when things appear near my cursor though
[23:50:42] <RET> that would affect the page performance
[23:50:47] <coldhead> it sure would
[23:50:59] <coldhead> affect it like a gypsy on stilts
[23:51:00] <RET> yea, so i wont do this ^^ thought about it too
[23:51:20] <greg5green> mulch2: without knowing too much about your specific markup/etc. I think you could use $(this) or this and avoid a second sizzle lookup
[23:52:22] <mulch2> http://jsfiddle.net/wfyD9/2/
[23:52:25] <greg5green> mulch2: and sorry, i didn't get what you were asking at first. Hans_Henrik was saying you should use the .input() method for supporting old IE
[23:52:31] <mulch2> That's what I've got thus far.
[23:52:40] <greg5green> which you aren't
[23:52:43] <mulch2> Now I just need the regex validation
[23:52:45] <greg5green> you are using the input selector
[23:53:08] <greg5green> (which you could probably speed up by using an id or $(this))
[23:53:18] <greg5green> assuming you are clicking on something
[23:53:19] <greg5green> :)
[23:53:27] <greg5green> and sorry, regex is above me
[23:53:29] <greg5green> i wish it wasn't but it is
[23:54:18] <mulch2> Thanks for the help tho, greg. I appreciate it
[23:54:20] <mulch2> The jsfiddle link I pasted has html markup too, if anyone can take a look.
[23:54:27] <mulch2> Just a simple search box.
[23:55:07] <mulch2> I'm just out of my element here... So not sure how to add to that to do another validation check
[23:55:49] <mulch2> But I need the input to follow the format AZ1234.
