[00:27:52] <LeGorille> is there a jquery function that removes duplicates objects from a json array ?
[00:29:18] <LeGorille> I have an array where some object are identical
[00:37:11] <LeGorille> beep
[01:11:46] <Genitrust> is there a way to use the query selector after selecting an item's "parent"?
[01:12:10] <Genitrust> for example, $('#field').parent().tag('span').hide(); ? :D
[01:12:14] <Genitrust> heck, that might even work...
[05:31:39] <pr0phet> anyone?
[05:32:14] <pr0phet> i have a doubt on jquery
[05:34:56] <pr0phet> could you tell how to pass values to an array in jquery class
[07:20:49] <szt> Hello, I just found out that when I have a custom event such as "a.b.c" a .trigger on "a.b" will also cause "a.b.c" handlers to be called. Now I found this out by surprise and I am wondering if this is some kind of namespacing convention that I am not aware of or a bug.
[08:06:34] <shoky> szt: yes events have namespacing by dot, see docs for .on()
[08:40:58] <cambazz> i have a json object that i am having hard time to deserialize: like: "meta_value_en_US":"\""
[08:41:07] <cambazz> what is the proper escape sequence for json
[08:41:30] <no_gravity> cambazz: you "have" a json object?
[08:42:53] <cambazz> yes, it is just that the JSON.parse() will crash if one of the fields is "
[08:43:12] <cambazz> \" should do it, i.e. escape it but it still crashes
[08:43:51] <no_gravity> I see. You have a string that contains a json.
[08:44:04] <no_gravity> But JSON.parse() says it's not valid.
[08:44:15] <no_gravity> Make a minimal fiddle of the problem.
[08:45:07] <cambazz> ok i found out: JSON.parse('{"a":"\""}');
[08:45:14] <cambazz> i mean isolated the case
[08:45:40] <cambazz> JSON.parse('{"a":"b"}'); <- this does not cause an error
[08:45:40] <shoky> cambazz: in a javascript string literal, \ is escaping as well, so if you want to output an actual \ you need to put \\
[08:46:06] <cambazz> shoky: well that was the escape
[08:46:22] <shoky> cambazz: there are 2 different escapes here
[08:46:31] <cambazz> shoky: the question is how do we escape " that is embedded in a json object
[08:46:31] <shoky> javascript string literal escaping,  and json string escaping
[08:46:38] <shoky> 2 completely separate things
[08:46:41] <no_gravity> cambazz: JSON.parse('{"a":"\\""}');
[08:46:44] <shoky> ^
[08:46:47] <no_gravity> is there a js bot here?
[08:46:51] <no_gravity> js> 123
[08:47:04] <shoky> seems not ;p
[08:47:16] <no_gravity> should have one :)
[08:47:27] <no_gravity> On the other hand, it's not a jquery question.
[08:47:28] <shoky> there used to be a nicer bot long time ago
[08:47:31] <no_gravity> And #javascript has one.
[08:47:42] <shoky> it has succumbed to the times
[08:47:52] <shoky> or bad maintainance, whatever ;p
[08:48:16] <shoky> !botsnack
[08:48:19] <shoky> ?botsnack
[08:48:19] <b-ot> Thank you! OMNOMNOMNOMNOM
[08:48:28] <shoky> ?js 1
[08:48:46] <cambazz> ok, so \\" does not error. so the first \ generates the second \ which is an escape char for the "
[08:49:00] <shoky> the \\ generates the \
[08:49:01] <shoky> ;)
[08:49:24] <shoky> the first \\ is a javasript escape sequence for a \
[08:49:33] <shoky> er, s/first//
[08:50:07] <shoky> e.g. in a pure .json file that has just JSON data, you wouldn't put \\ for that
[08:50:20] <shoky> but you're in javascript , not in a .json file
[08:50:41] <shoky> and you want your javscript to output valid json
[08:52:00] <shoky> though... you shouldn't really be ever having this issue since you shouldn't be writing json by hand
[08:52:28] <cambazz> shoky: well i am using google gson from the servlet side. and printing them out.
[08:52:51] <cambazz> i make an object then print it to json, and carefully examine each time
[08:53:01] <shoky> then it should output proper json
[08:53:17] <shoky> (not javascript in this case)
[08:55:02] <shoky> not sure what you mean by "carefully examine each time"

[10:21:30] <z1haze> i am getting an http 500 from a pjax request on my server, but nothing more than that any ideas?
[10:21:48] <z1haze> im using a backend framework, so typically i would get a error returned
[10:43:21] <PSUser2> i want to use $.getJSON() to retrieve a JSON from a php, and then save that json in a global variable, so that i could filter and display it later, based on gui checkboxes. how can i save it to a global variable?
[12:13:21] <momomo> is there any chance in hell it is possible to make a background-image/element responsive? when you use an img, you can set the width:80%; for instance, and the height will auto adjust. however, for background-image css property, you are forced to set both height and width .... you might have a width on parent say 20%, then the background needs to be say 90% of that ... but how the fcuk do you set the height in such cases. obviously the
[12:13:22] <momomo> element needs a height set, but there is no way as far as I know to set the height based on parent width element, say parentWidth*imgRatio ... you can only do that with calc(100vw .. calc(100%OFWIDTH is not possible, or is it?
[12:16:54] <sillyslux> background-size: cover and contain are no good?
[13:10:50] <iDentity1337> Even though this IRC is not for fancyBox problems, could someone help me? I've included jQuery-3.1.0 and below it i've included jquery.fancybox.pack, jquery.fancybox.css and also a <script> to call fancybox() on the element i want
[13:10:59] <iDentity1337> but still element opens in a new page
[13:57:44] <Finnoloid> Hey, got a question. Where do I find a list of most popular designs? I am looking for inspiring alternatives for Material, Flat & Metro UI. Any suggestions/websites?
[15:56:01] <Calinou> Finnoloid: there's http://materialup.com for MD
[15:56:17] <Calinou> Modern UI ("Metro") seems to have less traction, don't know any sites for it
[16:10:52] <arc_> Calinou i think he was asking for alternatives to those, not like .. a list of sites that use them :p
[17:01:12] <laMenta> Hi

[19:29:54] <knia> bump -- https://thepb.in/p/NkfrcR5OAB8V9UO -- fadeOut just happens instantly (as if .hide() ). any clues?
[19:34:31] <knia> last bump -- https://thepb.in/p/NkfrcR5OAB8V9UO -- fadeOut just happens instantly (as if .hide() ). any clues?
[19:35:12] <systemfault> Without a testcase, we cannot help.
[19:35:40] <systemfault> Just dumping your code on a pastebin isn't enough... use something like jsfiddle.net where we can reproduce the issue.
[19:46:07] <grill> hey. how are you supposed to refer to the delegated selector when using the .on() function?
[19:46:38] <grill> this appears to refer to the parent element
[19:53:53] <grill> oh, also, i'm using an arrow function
[20:08:01] <shoky> grill: usually you use `this` to get the element that the event handler was attached to, but that wouldn't work in an arrow function.. you can use event.currentTarget
[20:08:18] <shoky> (where event is the argument passed to the handler)
[21:19:59] <kof> How to check null value   if ((k == 'sold_status') && (v != '')){ }  still getting null values

[21:23:09] <kof> thanx shoky :D
[21:38:03] <acidjazz> how the hell do i scroll an internal div
[21:38:05] <acidjazz> an internal element
[21:57:34] <shoky> set its scrollTop/scrollLeft property
[22:36:59] <alturic> hey guys, I'm new to jquery and even newer to google maps, but is there any way to remove the markers on this? http://pastebin.com/raw/md9j7LYk - I don't know if it's the $.each causing it, but even if I try making "marker" global it keeps saying "Cannot read property 'setMap' of undefined"
[22:59:12] <Captain_Ramius> What do you guys know about HTML5 Storage or jQuery .data() ?
[22:59:58] <Captain_Ramius> Punchline: I'm looking to make a webapp that will work offline in remote areas and save data until an internet connection is available again, (max wait is a few hours)
[23:12:43] <Captain_Ramius> Anyone? Anyone? Bueller?
[23:15:23] <systemfault> Captain_Ramius: You want HTML5 storage.
[23:15:41] <systemfault> jQuery,data is useless for you because it's not persistent.
[23:16:06] <Captain_Ramius> Duly noted.
[23:16:38] <Captain_Ramius> I'm trying to avoid a native app. Someone suggested cookies but I don't know enough about them.
[23:16:58] <Captain_Ramius> Would there be any danger if the User closes the browser or something? (hence the cookie idea)
[23:16:59] <systemfault> Cookies are useless for anything but the simplest cases.
[23:17:19] <systemfault> Cookies are 4k max.. and are sent with every requests
[23:17:30] <Captain_Ramius> Good to know. I don't usually get such simple answers on IRC. Excuse me while I pinch myself to see if I'm dreaming
[23:17:33] <systemfault> localStorage is what you want.
[23:18:05] <Captain_Ramius> So HTML5 localStorage and use JS to check periodically to see if we have a connection?
[23:18:48] <systemfault> Yeah, hopefully, if you support newer browsers, you can check if navigator.onLine is true
[23:57:54] <acidjazz> whats .onLINE do
[23:57:56] <acidjazz> .onLine
