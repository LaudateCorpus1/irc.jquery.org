[00:00:17] <thomedy> its a good thing you answered i would have just kept coming up with dumb acronyms
[00:00:27] <Dr-Bombay> bah
[00:00:43] <thomedy> its my hummer 'ombre'
[00:00:50] <thomedy> (hombre)
[00:01:02] <thomedy> stuff like that
[00:01:37] <D4> I have article > nav // section // section.details <-- how would i inside the nav target the first section after article? I tried .closest('article').first('section') but it selects the entire article for some reason.
[00:01:51] <Dr-Bombay> yay google maps just disappeared down a hole
[00:02:43] <jrockjiggz> D4: i don't think first is a jQuery function
[00:02:48] <boogyman> $('article section:first-child') should be fine D4
[00:03:19] <D4> boogyman » Well, I'm inside "nav" already, and I want to do $(this).closest('article').something_to_target_first_section (not section.details)
[00:03:25] <thomedy> i have no idea why the animation() is going so many times
[00:03:27] <thomedy> bah!
[00:03:33] <StevenCodes> d4 .next()

[00:05:06] <D4> StevenCodes » Thanks for your input, I've tried $(this).closest('article').next('section'); as well but it returns [] as nothing is targetted
[00:05:15] <StevenCodes> hmm
[00:05:15] <gf3> thomedy: aka bot-t
[00:05:26] <StevenCodes> D4,  you got link
[00:05:30] <gf3> thomedy: He is literally standing behind meâ€¦
[00:05:33] <D4> Sure, can I send it to you?
[00:05:39] <StevenCodes> D4,  Sure
[00:05:39] <thomedy> you have to understand i know everyone else hates that sorta thing but i t hink its hilarious so while i respect everyones needs.... that was awesome
[00:05:41] <mattyh88> hi, is something wrong with this piece of code? As I see the change event isn't triggered :(
[00:05:41] <mattyh88> $("#account_no").val($("input[name='template[account]']:checked + label").text()).trigger("change");
[00:06:49] <StevenCodes> I woke up... pissed off... had 25 missed calls, yeah im ballin like chris paul dunk on your ass like bball, imma supa star, gettin money, you actin dumb b*tch you ook funny
[00:06:50] <StevenCodes> lol
[00:06:52] <thomedy> i have to be honest jquery doesnt' really feel like code it feels more like and i htink this might be the most accurate descriptionf rom what i can tell so far but more of a javascript api
[00:07:21] <StevenCodes> thomedy,  Have you checked out node yet ?
[00:07:30] <thomedy> i have no idea what node is at all
[00:08:24] <Defrothew> http://pastebin.com/CNGVQ3er - Can anyone look into this. How can I integrate mouseover and pass the variable to the .popover?
[00:08:52] <thomedy> but i do this i have to be up in 3 hours  for my job so im going to bed i guess ill be back tommororw unfortunately cuz i dont know at all what is causing my error
[00:09:21] <thomedy> im so at a loss in fact i dont even know where to go to just try stuff and get some progress that way or what to google
[00:09:25] <thomedy> i mean im confused
[00:14:22] <thomedy> nope im a lier i think i may have got it
[00:17:45] <thomedy> web stuff is weird
[00:17:54] <thomedy> in c++ i dont think that would have been a problem
[00:18:20] <coldhead> different problems
[00:18:35] <coldhead> no null pointer exceptions on the web
[00:18:42] <coldhead> no IE in c++
[00:19:46] <thomedy> i basically meant its different learning to code from strict to loose or whatever not bad not bad at all my professer used to say his favorite languege was always the one that had a paycheck with it
[00:19:58] <solars> hey, I need some assistance with this https://gist.github.com/4ab281b81a7c41262953 I'm not sure how to iterate over the tr.rate elements that follow a tr.room (not all of them, just the ones up to the next tr.room)
[00:20:09] <solars> I then need to find out if those contain more than 2 spans
[00:20:14] <solars> could anyone give me a hint?
[00:20:57] <ximarin> hi all, question: I have a standard php array. This shall now be submitted to another script with $.post. How can I do this?
[00:21:34] <ximarin> js-arrays are automatically transformed into arr[]=bla&arr[]=bli... and so on
[00:21:36] <thomedy> this should work but now i have to figure out what about my abilities in jquery is causing my page to load so slowly or if it is the fact that im loading all the images first right now thats 30 images or something
[00:21:41] <thomedy> but its going to get bigger and bigger
[00:23:52] <thomedy> i just used the firebug to watch my page load i think its actually the images thats good
[00:24:31] <thomedy> okay that wasn't actually a solution for my animation but i have eto be up in 2 in a half hours
[00:24:44] <thomedy> ill be back after work for help if its okay
[00:24:47] <thomedy> night all
[00:28:19] <joobie> guys is there a neat looking jquery table control out there? i have a database that im trying to present a few of the vlaues in a table format.. wanted to give the sort button, etc so you can click the header and it sorts the fields, etc..
[00:28:32] <joobie> wondering if i have to do my own and incorporate jquery or if jquery already has some module to do this
[00:33:55] <Afflicto> How can I get the string length of my POST data recieved through $.post() ?
[00:39:38] <StevenCodes> Afflicto,  data.returned.length()
[00:39:55] <StevenCodes> hmm var r = $.post()
[00:40:00] <StevenCodes> 4.length()
[00:40:06] <StevenCodes> r.length() *
[00:47:47] <pneftali> hrm guys - i have divs that i want to resize and rotate on hover. it's working except that i want to make the rotation smooth. currently the rotation occurs after the resize animation and it rotates fast...
[00:47:49] <pneftali> http://jsfiddle.net/9K3WU/
[00:52:04] <JavaLover> guys this is ridiculous I have a path that I can pull up...but theres no such page on my server
[00:52:24] <hyperstream> JavaLover, huh?
[00:52:24] <JavaLover> the path is public/user/login    it points to a page but I don't have a page there on my server wtf
[00:53:14] <hyperstream> JavaLover, check the webserver access logs, see what its really trying to pull, the error log should show info on premission or non existing stuff perhaps
[00:53:21] <Trisox> http://lab.smashup.it/flip/
[00:54:24] <JavaLover> well the thing is I have this framework installed
[00:54:31] <JavaLover> and I think the framework is causing it to happen....
[00:54:46] <JavaLover> but idk can you have a page that doesn't exist simply by uploading php files?
[00:54:56] <bigkevmcd> JavaLover: of course you can
[00:55:04] <hyperstream> JavaLover, permissions perhaps
[00:55:09] <JavaLover> bigkev: how would you do that?
[00:55:12] <beancurd> .htaccess
[00:55:15] <bigkevmcd> JavaLover: the index.php of the framework can represent any page it likes
[00:55:30] <bigkevmcd> JavaLover: same with servlets in Java
[00:55:55] <JavaLover> so if I remove index.php
[00:55:58] <JavaLover> it'll remove this?
[00:56:15] <beancurd> probably.
[00:56:18] <hyperstream> LOL
[00:56:18] <bigkevmcd> JavaLover: you might as well delete the entire framework...
[00:56:24] <beancurd> stuff will probably break too.
[00:56:28] <JavaLover> sweet!
[00:56:29] <JavaLover> totally worked
[00:56:53] <JavaLover> wow that's fucking cool
[00:57:09] <JavaLover> so you can just make any type of link you want...is there a name for this?
[00:57:18] <beancurd> magic.
[00:57:28] <JavaLover> what's this technique called?
[00:57:34] <beancurd> sometimes spelled magick.
[00:57:47] <hyperstream> TROLL
[00:58:50] <JavaLover> no really waht's it called so I can go learn how this works
[00:59:20] <hyperstream> JavaLover, reading about the software and technologies you are using :)
[01:00:01] <JavaLover> well i don't get how you can define something from index.php & it effects everything else such as adding link paths
[01:00:13] <JavaLover> wish I knew what the name was for it...and maybe if I could see a tutorial
[01:01:32] <beancurd> url rewriting
[01:03:51] <MoTiOnXml> what beancurd said
[01:04:27] <JavaLover> so is this how they do like twitter.com/myname
[01:04:33] <MoTiOnXml> yes
[01:04:42] <JavaLover> awwww gotcha
[01:04:47] <MoTiOnXml> they translate the meaning of that url to numbers internally (or identifiers)
[01:04:48] <JavaLover> wow i didn't know this was possible awesome
[01:05:04] <MoTiOnXml> oh, if only you knew :)
[01:05:54] <MoTiOnXml> it's just the IA of that particular site (information architecture)
[01:06:10] <MoTiOnXml> i.e. the hierarchical relationship of pages
[01:06:33] <JavaLover> cool cool
[01:06:39] <JavaLover> so then everytime you visit a page
[01:06:42] <JavaLover> it calls index.php first?
[01:06:56] <MoTiOnXml> i've made IA virtualization software for some very large companies
[01:07:11] <JavaLover> wow cool
[01:07:15] <MoTiOnXml> that depends on the url you're requesting
[01:07:24] <JavaLover> wish I had something that would show me what's happening in this php script
[01:07:31] <MoTiOnXml> domain.com could translate to anything internally, index.php for instance
[01:07:49] <JavaLover> all I know is if I remove index.php my page is not found but if I replace it, then it is
[01:08:07] <JavaLover> but the page i'm calling is login/users and has nothing to do with index.php but apparently it does
[01:08:27] <MoTiOnXml> you're probably thinking about a default document
[01:08:31] <JavaLover> i'm decoding this index.php right now it seems like it loads all kinds of stuff for the environment to work, i'm using zend
[01:08:47] <MoTiOnXml> you can't serve a directory as a page (well, you can, but it's usually not what you want)
[01:09:03] <JavaLover> oh i don't want to it's how the page works
[01:09:05] <MoTiOnXml> so when you request a directory - domain.com - you need to provide a default document
[01:09:14] <JavaLover> i have to understand how this guy does what he's doing, so I can do it from my own page
[01:09:28] <MoTiOnXml> well, configure the web server to look for a default document that matches your index.php page then
[01:09:37] <JavaLover> oh when i put login/users   that's psuedo...really it's like mysite.com/login/users
[01:10:16] <MoTiOnXml> then you're looking for 1) a physical restructuring of your files or 2) using url rewriting
[01:10:40] <MoTiOnXml> just think of the url as the directories expected to be on disk, if not using url rewriting
[01:10:48] <MoTiOnXml> i'm leaving now - read up on it :)
[01:12:47] <Defrothew> Can anyone help me with elements? I query 5 posts with post IDs 500, 312, 33, 34, 15 and their div id names corresponds to popover-POSTID. My probem is how do I make this $("#popover-"+num) to work with the 5 divs? I named the divs uniquely because it would call a unique div content.
[01:14:42] <hyperstream> Defrothew, same issue as before ?
[01:15:36] <beancurd> Defrothew: $("[id^=popover]")
[01:15:40] <Defrothew> @hyperstream Yes. Seems like the element didn't solve this issue. As I need to have a unique id element for each div because of the unique content.
[01:15:53] <beancurd> alternatively.. just add a class to those elements?
[01:16:19] <beancurd> sorry, i meant $("[id^=popover-]")
[01:16:50] <Defrothew> @beancurd Ok, I'll try this.
[01:17:03] <Ricaz> Can someone explain to me why this won't work? http://pastebin.com/iPCC1hf8
[01:17:09] <beancurd> $("[id^=popover-]") <
[01:17:19] <beancurd> that targets anything starting with 'popover-'
[01:17:24] <beancurd> $("[id^=jander]")
[01:17:26] <beancurd> oops.
[01:17:39] <Ricaz> wait, fixed: http://pastebin.com/3RdA3SrH
[01:18:09] <beancurd> hmm..
[01:18:15] <Defrothew> @beancurd This worked but the problem is I need to showa unique conent.
[01:18:24] <Ricaz> nevermind!
[01:18:40] <beancurd> Defrothew: i don't understand, can you link to what you're tring to do?
[01:19:31] <Defrothew> @beancurd Sorry I'm using my localhost. I'll give you the code via jsfiddle.net
[01:20:11] <beancurd> sure.
[01:20:35] <beancurd> leaving the house soon though.
[01:22:42] <Defrothew> @beancurd http://jsfiddle.net/ugmYR/
[01:27:11] <beancurd> Defrothew: oh right, you need to return popover content.
[01:27:33] <beancurd> num.
[01:28:04] <raj> using https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload/wiki I'd like to have multiple selected files show up together in the POST, not POST to the same url consecutively
[01:28:08] <raj> any idea how I might accomplish this?
[01:28:39] <Defrothew> @beancurd Yeah.
[01:29:15] <Defrothew> @beancurd The num corresponds to the element being called.
[01:29:42] <beancurd> off the top of my head, give your <a> a class of 'num', then catch that in your click()
[01:29:57] <Defrothew> @beancurd mypopover-1 will call popover-content-1
[01:30:12] <beancurd> yeah, so the number is always the same.
[01:30:40] <Defrothew> @beancurd By the way, its onmousehover.
[01:30:51] <beancurd> or you can either grab the whole id, and strip the 'mypopover-' to get the 'num'
[01:31:07] <Defrothew> @beancurd How to do that? :D
[01:31:25] <Defrothew> @beancurd stripping the ipd and getting the num out of mypopover-?
[01:31:29] <Defrothew> id*
[01:31:52] <beancurd> gotta go.
[01:32:03] <Defrothew> @beancurd Bye. Thanks for the idea. :)
[01:49:06] <chacha> http://www.planetwildlife.com/in/travel --------- how to get the map functionality which is on the top right?
[01:58:01] <Timo89> Hello everyone, is there a way to do something like $('.buttonClass').button() with elements, that have been added to the dom sometime after pageload via ajax? I've found on() and live() but live() only works on events like blur and focus. Concrete example: I have a page with a table shown, on the right side is a div which can "blind" show so it takes up about half the page, when the user wants
[01:58:01] <Timo89> to add a new entry to the table, the div slides out and content is loaded into it, but the buttons of the new div don't have the "button()" attached to it
[02:00:36] <thinkerbell> can you run animate() on page load?  I can get it working when I use a trigger, like  $("#triggerAnimateTest").click(function(){ $("#animateTest").animate({..., but if I just try to have it animate on page load without the click trigger, it doesn't work
[02:01:46] <Defrothew> Can anyone please review my code? Why is this not working? http://pastebin.com/19Lr3P2u
[02:02:30] <Woet> ?demo @ Defrothew
[02:02:31] <bot-t> Defrothew, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[02:03:11] <Defrothew> Oh, sorry.
[02:13:13] <aro> i am having a problem - i cannot get jquery to change the css/innerhtml of an absolutely positioned element
[02:13:19] <D4> var section = $(this).closest('article').children(':first'); <-- I have <article><section></section><section></section></article> and I'm targeting the first section. I tried .closest('article').next('section'); and .next(), and .first(); any other way I can try? This works but I'm not sure it's the best way.
[02:14:22] <ChrisTheSorcerer> D4: Have you tried .closest('article').next()?
[02:14:29] <D4> Yes
[02:14:39] <D4> For some reason, the article is targeted
[02:14:45] <D4> having both sections, not the first one
[02:15:03] <ChrisTheSorcerer> Hmm, might it be that you've miscalculated what "this" is again? This is tricky *badum-tish*
[02:15:16] <DarsVaeda> hi, I open a dialog and in that I call confirm() if confirm returns true I want to do dialog.remove(), this works but then the confirm-dialog is still there, I have to click OK or Cancel in it again to have it gone
[02:16:52] <Ricaz> Anyone got experience using the slider plugin for UI?
[02:19:20] <D4> ChrisTheSorcerer » $('section > nav').on('click', function() { var section = $(this).closest('article').next() }); fails
[02:19:32] <D4> .closest('article') works, but - the entire article.
[02:19:48] <D4> .closest('article').children(':first') does work, but as said, not sure it's the best way
[02:20:14] <ChrisTheSorcerer> D4: Not entirely sure, but I think "next" looks for the next element after the closing tag, so the section within the article will be skipped...
[02:20:16] <ChrisTheSorcerer> ?child
[02:20:16] <bot-t> parent > child: Selects all direct child elements specified by "child" of elements specified by "parent". http://api.jquery.com/child-selector/
[02:20:44] <D4> child/children would target both, yes
[02:20:52] <nFFF> D4, whats wrong with using children().first()?
[02:20:53] <ChrisTheSorcerer> Maybe closest('article').child().first() ?
[02:20:56] <nFFF> or :first
[02:22:09] <ChrisTheSorcerer> D4: If it's the only thing that works, then it has to be the best way ;)
[02:22:53] <nFFF> I don't understand 'best way', whats wrong with it ?
[02:22:54] <ChrisTheSorcerer> The first thing we learned in school was to weigh time of finding out better ways against just writing the ugly code. If it takes too long to find a better way, then the way you found is probably good enough
[02:23:35] <nFFF> closest will return an object that contains all children anyway
[02:23:41] <aro> http://jsfiddle.net/w3BYy/1/
[02:23:50] <nFFF> it's not like your having you tranvserse the DOM again
[02:24:00] <aro> i got that working, but on my site, it does not work. however, if i manually edit the field with firebug, it DOES work
[02:24:06] <aro> jquery just wont interact with it
[02:25:05] <D4> nFFF » I'm not entirely sure but I was thinking IF I, at some point, would like to add something before the first <section>, it would break entirely.
[02:25:09] <ChrisTheSorcerer> aro: Have you checked that the link to the jQuery.js is correct on your site?
[02:25:11] <D4> can I do :first section ?
[02:25:24] <neurotech> What's the term used to describe the security method on websites where you navigate to a page and a javascript(?) alert pops up asking for a username and password?
[02:25:46] <aro> ChrisTheSorcerer: ....yes
[02:25:55] <aro> the other jquery interactions work
[02:26:06] <nFFF> D4, what is $(this) in your code
[02:26:16] <ChrisTheSorcerer> aro: Then I don't know by just looking at the sample you sent ,since it's working there
[02:26:20] <D4> nFFF » $('section > nav').on('click', function() {
[02:26:38] <D4> :first section seemed to work, so that would be better than just :first in my case
[02:26:46] <nFFF> yea you can put a selector in children
[02:26:55] <nFFF> children('section').first()
[02:27:12] <nFFF> ?children(selector)
[02:27:13] <bot-t> .children([selector]): Get the children of each element in the set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/children/
[02:27:41] <nFFF> so it won't matter what you put infront of the first section as you can filter the children and just get section elements
[02:27:46] <D4> Ah, that worked as well - so what would be the difference between using .children(':first section') and .children('section').first() =
[02:28:00] <D4> Okay, I'm thinking about the performance
[02:28:05] <nFFF> don't
[02:28:11] <nFFF> it doesn't matter
[02:28:47] <aro> ugg
[02:28:47] <D4> For this case specific you mean?
[02:28:47] <aro> ok
[02:29:05] <nFFF> yes
[02:29:06] <ChrisTheSorcerer> aro: is it possible to link to your live project?
[02:29:16] <nFFF> I woluld use .first() it reads better for me
[02:29:28] <aro> ChrisTheSorcerer: i can try. can I PM you?
[02:29:38] <D4> Me too, I went with that approach :)
[02:29:39] <ChrisTheSorcerer> aro: sure
[02:30:08] <nFFF> I imagine it would be faster, as it's simply reducing the set of elements to it's first
[02:30:13] <nFFF> where as :first is a selector
[02:30:21] <nFFF> but I doubt either would make much difference
[02:30:22] <raj> nFFF, have you ever used jQuery-File-Upload?
[02:30:30] <nFFF> nope
[02:30:33] <raj> hmm
[02:30:43] <D4> nFFF » By the way, this 'transition' I'm making, it works now but there's a gap between the animations which shows the body background color a few pixels, any chance you could take a look and see if it's possible to queue the transitions directly after eachother? Or something.
[02:30:44] <raj> I'm having trouble making multiple files upload in one POST
[02:30:53] <nFFF> ?queue
[02:30:54] <bot-t> .queue([queueName]): Show the queue of functions to be executed on the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/queue/
[02:31:12] <nFFF> you can queue functions/animations
[02:32:15] <raj> any idea?
[02:32:18] <D4> Not sure it'd help me though, using show/hide and hide/show atm
[02:32:47] <raj> d4, if you're show/hiding and the hide/showing, just use a timer, no?
[02:32:49] <nFFF> raj sorry try stack overflow
[02:33:33] <D4> raj » Well, I think I need to other way around, as in.. half way though the hide I need to run the show so they "overlap" more than now, to decrease the black gap
[02:33:47] <D4> err, I need to go the other way around*
[02:33:52] <Defrothew> Can anyone give me another alternative for my code? Because I need to hover twice so that I could view my divs. I know this is because of the two mouseover. Maybe you have another alternative to only hover once. http://jsfiddle.net/mT76T/495/
[02:35:29] <Whirl3d> Here's a simple one...if you are animating multiple items $("list").animate() and you have a complete callback in the animation, does it fire once or once for each item?
[02:35:52] <Cork> Whirl3d: yes
[02:35:59] <Cork> $() is an array
[02:36:09] <Cork> and you run animate on each member in the array
[02:36:56] <Martz_> good morning all, anyone can help me please? I want to change the image of a button (so user can see he/she have been here), but it doesnt work, anyone knows what i do wrong here? :http://jsfiddle.net/vvna5/
[02:37:54] <Whirl3d> so $(".sevenItems").animate({opacity:0},{duration:500, complete:function () {console.log("testing "+$(this).index());}}); should log testing 0, testing 1, etc.
[02:38:41] <Cork> or texting 5, 1, 3, 0, 2
[02:38:54] <Cork> it depends on when the animation of the element ends
[02:39:14] <Whirl3d> why wouldn't it end in the dom order?
[02:39:47] <Whirl3d> However, they don't animate sequentially?
[02:40:13] <D4> How can I start a .show half way through a .hide ?
[02:40:30] <Whirl3d> D4, yes if you use .stop
[02:40:51] <mc___> is it possible to serialize a sortable with its values? when I use serialize now I only get the IDs
[02:41:29] <Whirl3d> and lookup the parameters for stop...they are important. One is clear queue (which should be true) and the other is something like: put element in the final state of the running animation when done. That one you might want false for fading in and out
[02:44:51] <Whirl3d> I kinda feel like animate should affect all elements in the collection, but should treat the collection as its own object...performing the callback just once for the original animate. Then, if you want to distibute the complete callback for every element, use .each() and animate every element.
[02:45:54] <lij> is there any plugin which implements sorting and paging in ul li list
[02:46:14] <Defrothew> Could anyone help me? Is there an alternative for http://jsfiddle.net/mT76T/495/ my code. Particularly mouseover();
[02:46:46] <D4> Whirl3d » Read the examples but I'm not entirely sure how to use it with the .hide and .show; so say I've got .hide('slide', 350); and at 175 I'd like to start .show() as well. This is due to my two animations/transitions aren't queued as they should so there's a gap between the two showing the background color
[02:47:29] <D4> section 1 with "green" and section 2 with blue BG's, and then there's body with black, there's a few pixels of black in between animations
[02:47:44] <Whirl3d> It doesn't make sense to run them simultaneously since they are modifying the same properties
[02:48:10] <D4> Hm.. what can I do? Would it help with an example of what I'm experiencing? :)
[02:48:16] <Whirl3d> D4, use .animate
[02:48:38] <lij> whirl3d, is there any plugin which implements sorting and paging in ul li list
[02:49:50] <D4> Whirl3d » As in .animate('slide', {direction: 'left'}, function() { something }) ? Not following exactly how animate would do what my hide/show is currently doing
[02:49:50] <Whirl3d> $("bluediv").animate({opacity:0},{duration:350, queue:false}); $("greenDiv").delay(175).animate({opacity:1},{duration:350, queue:false});
[02:51:23] <Whirl3d> lij, I would say that this is a good job for google. The answer is undoubtedly yes, but I do not have any expereince with such a plugin. You might want to check jquery UI
[02:51:27] <Martz_> good morning all, anyone can help me please? I want to change the image of a button (so user can see he/she have been here), but it doesnt work, anyone knows what i do wrong here? :http://jsfiddle.net/vvna5/
[02:51:39] <Dr-Bombay> if your animation is not just a linear change of properties from one value to another, what's the next best way to hook into jquery's animation model
[02:51:44] <Dr-Bombay> kind of an abstract question here
[02:51:45] <D4> Whirl3d » That'd be "equivalent" to .hide and .show without the 'slide' and 'display: none' ? I'm using jQ UI for the 'slide' transitions
[02:52:24] <Whirl3d> Dr. Bombay, look for css3 transforms, but you probably want easing. So lookup jquery easing plugin.
[02:52:41] <msk2020ckp> I got Uncaught ReferenceError........
[02:53:06] <itatitat> ey guys
[02:53:20] <itatitat> I need to replace some libraries dinamically, because Im using ajax
[02:53:22] <Whirl3d> D4, you'd have to lookup how jquery UI handles it. If it slides to the left, for example, add that to you animation properties.
[02:53:43] <itatitat> but I dont know how to replace the libraries, because I dont know how to get the dom elements
[02:53:55] <itatitat> ou...............................................................
[02:53:56] <itatitat> okok
[02:54:02] <itatitat> sorry, I anser to myself
[02:54:04] <itatitat> thank
[02:54:29] <Whirl3d> Then the only other thing you have to do is on the one you are animating out, in the options object (right after duration or queu, add the line: complete:function () {$(this).css("{opacity:0},{display:none});}
[02:54:33] <D4> Whirl3d » idd it does, I'm trying to figure out how to use animate with the slide transition - $(section).animate({"slide", {direction: 'left'}, {duration: 350, queue: false}}); doesn't feel right ;p
[02:55:22] <Whirl3d> Well, I would say keep asking until someone has a better answer. I told you the way I'd do it, so if there's a better way, someone here would be able to help.
[02:58:35] <lij> whirl3d i have implemented some thing like this
[02:58:43] <D4> Whirl3d » It's not that if there's a better way, it's that I don't understand where the actual 'slide' transitions goes within the .animate(), if it's the property or easing. I get the part where I set opacity to 0 and hide it.. Just not where to put the slide effect
[03:00:46] <lij> whirl3d, please check this http://testprintxpress.impezerp.com/customer/photos/7
[03:01:27] <lij> but i am getting a problem
[03:01:40] <Whirl3d> Who had the popout problem?
[03:01:41] <lij> if i sort albhabetically it is working
[03:02:03] <lij> but then if i go for paging it is not coming correct
[03:02:19] <Whirl3d> D4 gimme a minute to look it up for you. I'll study it and get back to you.
[03:03:31] <lij> whirl3d, did u get any chance to check the link
[03:03:57] <Whirl3d> lij, tell ya what. When I get a second, I'll let ya know.
[03:04:31] <D4> Whirl3d » wow, appreciate it! I was trying to add it to the .animate( property ) but I'm failing horribly.
[03:04:34] <Whirl3d> D4, the problem with shortcut methods like the one you want to use is that they don't always have the same signature as animate
[03:05:55] <Whirl3d> So, slide is just animate({left:distance}) or {top:distance}).
[03:06:14] <D4> aha, well I'll be back in a few- lunch is served. I'll highlight you and see if you have a spare moment later on to take a look where I'm at. Hopefully animate will work :)
[03:07:05] <lij> :)
[03:07:47] <Whirl3d> hide("slide", {direction:"down", 1000) is just .animate({opacity:0 , top:"+=1000"}, {duration:300, queue:false, complete:function () {($(this).css({opacity:0, display:"none"});}|);
[03:08:08] <lij> whirl3d he left for lunch
[03:08:13] <Whirl3d> lij, lemme see what I can do for you now
[03:08:34] <lij> u hav the link right?
[03:09:14] <Whirl3d> so what is the probem?
[03:10:00] <lij> paging is not working if you alphabetically sort
[03:10:27] <lij> both are not working together
[03:10:55] <lij> u alphabetically sort and click on the second page
[03:11:47] <lij> sorting is lost when i click on the pager links
[03:11:57] <pflock> does anyone know why the jquery post here http://jsfiddle.net/NhJYd/ isn't executed? that's all the code
[03:12:06] <lij> i am calling paging function in select change event
[03:14:33] <Whirl3d> I, personally don't like the sort plugin you are using.  It does some weird things (like inserting a blank text node as a flag node?
[03:14:49] <Dr-Bombay> pflock: what's the last thing that works?
[03:15:05] <lij> what is the alternative
[03:15:10] <pflock> Dr-Bombay: the first alert
[03:15:21] <Dr-Bombay> the first alert, what do you mean
[03:15:42] <pflock> the alert(login+" and "+password)
[03:15:56] <pflock> that is the last thing working in the script
[03:16:04] <Dr-Bombay> do you know whether the server receives the request
[03:17:20] <pflock> yes, I think so. is there a easy way to check if the php file is executed?
[03:18:01] <Dr-Bombay> pflock, I think you'll see here that all of the examples are calling post directly on $, and not on a query result.
[03:18:08] <Dr-Bombay> all the examples here: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.post/
[03:19:09] <pflock> Dr-Bombay: Yes, but that doesn't work too. I had it that way before
[03:21:37] <lij> quit
[03:21:46] <lij> joined
[03:22:34] <Horizons> mmmm coffee
[03:23:03] <lij> beer
[03:23:09] <Dr-Bombay> pflock: you need to find out whether the server gets the request, when post is used as documented
[03:23:25] <Horizons> lij: not something i would wake up to.
[03:23:44] <Dr-Bombay> if you're also developing the server, that should be straightforward. If not, an HTTP sniffer is a good tool to have around
[03:24:05] <lij> Horizon, wait for the dawn
[03:25:20] <pflock> Dr-Bombay: I now changed the php file so that it logs if it is executed and the Php script is called
[03:26:51] <Dr-Bombay> then I am not sure
[03:26:53] <lij> am w8ing for whirl3d
[03:34:58] <Whirl3d> sorry, Still working on it.
[03:35:08] <lij> NP
[03:35:16] <lij> tk ur tm
[03:36:39] <itatitat> ey guys
[03:36:47] <itatitat> how can I access to my data in a JSON=
[03:36:47] <itatitat> ?
[03:37:09] <Cork> itatitat: you mean a json string?
[03:37:14] <itatitat> yes
[03:37:25] <itatitat> I've an array
[03:37:27] <Cork> you get it through ajax?
[03:37:30] <itatitat> and I send the data by json
[03:37:32] <itatitat> yes
[03:37:34] <itatitat> using ajax
[03:37:47] <Cork> make sure the server sets the correct mimetype
[03:37:58] <Cork> and jquery should parse the string for you
[03:38:07] <itatitat> I know that I receive the response, because I saw it in the header
[03:38:12] <Cork> then you just go data[number]
[03:38:17] <itatitat> but I dont know how to get each data with JQuery
[03:38:26] <itatitat> only?
[03:38:39] <Cork> or $.each(data, function() {}
[03:38:51] <Cork> or for(var i; i < data.length;i++) {}
[03:39:04] <lij> cork you know any jquery to implement sorting and paging in a ul li list?
[03:39:25] <nisseni> how can I get .load to use post instead of get?
[03:39:27] <Cork> lij: theres most likly tons of plugins for that
[03:39:33] <Cork> nisseni: you can't
[03:39:40] <claudio> nisseni, no way
[03:39:47] <claudio> (hi Cork)
[03:39:59] <Cork> nisseni: $.post('url', function(data) { $(elm).html(data); })
[03:40:02] <Cork> claudio: ello
[03:41:23] <lij> corkk i could find only table sort, paging plugins, not ul li
[03:41:51] <Cork> lij: i'm quite busy right now, so can't help you search sorry
[03:42:37] <lij> k i did 1 but there is some mistake in that
[03:42:46] <lij> http://testprintxpress.impezerp.com/customer/photos/7
[03:43:08] <lij> when i go to 2nd page the sort does not work
[03:44:27] <nisseni> Cork: http://pastie.org/private/wm5glfbuaquwsnkdk7yta - I can see the POST in firebug, but not in $_POST...
[03:45:03] <lij> whirl3d u r here right?
[03:48:22] <Whirl3d> Yeah. I haven't been able to find the error. Cork is the brains in the organization, he could find it in seconds, I am sure
[03:48:51] <Cork> nisseni: you need a key for the value
[03:50:09] <nisseni> Cork: ah, of course
[03:50:11] <nisseni> thanks
[03:50:39] <Cork> Whirl3d: whats the problem your talking about?
[03:53:05] <lij> Whirl3d, You see cork is busy
[03:53:13] <Nece228> hi
[03:53:28] <Nece228> why this line doesnt select the link content
[03:53:29] <Nece228> $('#links a').attr('href').click(function()
[03:54:07] <xec> Nece228: .attr("href") will return a string, not a jquery collection
[03:54:34] <xec> what are you trying to do
[03:55:13] <Nece228> trying to select url which is in #links id
[03:56:18] <xec> "select" url? means what
[03:56:38] <Nece228> this did worked: $('#links,a[href]')
[03:56:44] <Nece228> oops
[03:56:47] <xec> you have selected the a element with $("#links a") - is this not sufficient?
[03:56:51] <Nece228> i meant this $('a[href]')
[03:57:18] <xec> you have <a> elements without a href??
[03:57:42] <Nece228> there are hrefs
[03:58:20] <xec> obviously. why are you including [href] in the selector, seems completely unnecessary to me
[03:58:31] <Whirl3d> Cork, sorry. lij is having a problem with paging and sorting. I didn't quite get the sort script and how it was supposed to work.
[03:58:44] <Nece228> as i said $('a[href]') this worked, but i want now to actually select same but only in links div
[03:58:52] <Nece228> the div id is links
[03:59:25] <xec> Nece228: like i said earlier, wouldn't your original selector $("#links a") do the trick?
[03:59:41] <Nece228> let me try...
[03:59:48] <lij> xec pleasse look this http://testprintxpress.impezerp.com/customer/photos/7
[04:00:09] <lij> tel me some way to implement paging and sorting in ul li list
[04:00:18] <xec> lij: do i know you?
[04:00:21] <Nece228> hmm doesnt work
[04:00:32] <xec> Nece228: what are you trying to do
[04:01:08] <lij> xec i am not sure
[04:02:08] <Nece228> wondering how to explain
[04:02:12] <xec> lij: if you have a question, post it to the channel, not to me :) but scrolling up it seems you already got an answer: there are probably a lot of plugins that let you do this. have you tried searching for one?
[04:02:45] <lij> i could see only you here, that is why i asked you
[04:02:47] <Nece228> want to select only the url (e.g. http://www.foo.com) from the document
[04:02:56] <lij> if it is not allowed here i am sorry
[04:03:19] <Nece228> but i want to select only those urls which are in div with a id "links"
[04:04:05] <Dr-Bombay> is there a function that deletes the history of a query (the one that is restored with end())
[04:05:09] <lij> i have tried searching, but could find only table sorter
[04:05:39] <xec> Nece228: you can't "select" an url, you can select DOM elements. do you want to select <a> elements that have a specific url?
[04:06:33] <Nece228> yes, i want to select <a> elements which are in specific div
[04:08:24] <xec> Nece228: http://jsfiddle.net/GY2ax/ like that?
[04:09:06] <Nece228> xec: no i want to select only whats in href attribute
[04:09:41] <Nece228> like this: http://www.example.com/, but not example.com
[04:10:32] <xec> Nece228: http://jsfiddle.net/GY2ax/1/ ?
[04:11:15] <lij> please somebody give me a link
[04:11:41] <Timo89> hello, I have a div that's being filled with content (via load) by button click, problem is: If I have a function that for example prepends a certain sign in front of input tags, the input tags in the newly loaded content are ignored even despite I call the specific function which prepends the signs at the end of the loaded content... can anyone help? I think I need something like load but not
[04:11:41] <Timo89> for events ...  is this even possible ? Can I somehow wait for the loading to complete and then call the function which prepends the signs ?
[04:11:59] <Nece228> xec: yes i think that, thanks ill try
[04:15:22] <dogarrhea2> so. there's this open source javascript library. i was looking through the code and noticed comments like: //get the fucking element
[04:15:29] <Nece228> xec: yay, its working, thanks!
[04:15:37] <dogarrhea2> it's also a bit buggy/unrobust. i think i'll stop using it.
[04:15:44] <dogarrhea2> soundmanager2 btw
[04:20:23] <sqwk> How can I send access the original this inside a .each loop?
[04:20:42] <sqwk> or rather send the original this as a second variable?
[04:32:58] <moncho_29> hi at all
[04:33:41] <moncho_29> excuse me for my english...   anybody knows a library or code for make  network diagrams with jquery please???
[04:33:48] <nFFF> sqwk, save it as variable
[04:33:52] <nFFF> that = this;
[04:34:05] <sqwk> ah, easy enough ;)
[04:36:58] <jeffsmykil> Anyone know of a firefox addon that opens the same page currently being viewed in IE as well?
[04:38:10] <sqwk> jeffsmykil: google ;) https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/open-in-ie/
[04:41:22] <jeffsmykil> sqwk: that takes a click
[04:41:31] <jeffsmykil> is there one that automates it?
[04:45:35] <Whirl3d> what does it mean when someone writes: $.fn.pluginname=(function () { ....    What is going on with the opening parenthesis?
[04:52:14] <Whirl3d> anbody?
[04:56:26] <ChrisTheSorcerer> Whirl3d:The open parenthesis marks the start of the anonymous function in this case, but it can be any parameter
[04:58:01] <Whirl3d> so why would you use an anonymouse function cached in the jquery.fn namespace?
[04:58:29] <Whirl3d> It seems either redundant or backwards...I can't figure out which. LOL THanks for the reply, btw
[04:59:22] <Whirl3d> is it some way of creating a closure?
[05:01:20] <ChrisTheSorcerer> Whirl3d: I have no clue, I don't know enough to even know what that would do, but I reckon there would be some uses for dynamically adding the name of the plugin...
[05:02:22] <Whirl3d> I'm trying to wrap my head around james padolsey's .sortElements plugin. I've never seen another plugin written this way. http://james.padolsey.com/javascript/sorting-elements-with-jquery/
[05:02:48] <quicksilver> Whirl3d: yes.
[05:03:05] <quicksilver> it's a way to localise the 'sort' variable.
[05:03:48] <Whirl3d> but then the anon function returns a function that returns a function
[05:04:00] <nFFF> It's so theres no conflict of variables
[05:04:00] <quicksilver> no
[05:04:05] <quicksilver> the anon function just returns a function.
[05:04:59] <Whirl3d> oh I see that now. THe map method returns a function (which I have never seen)....I see that now
[05:06:47] <GuestMeGo> anyone familiar with this error "This is not a valid Fuel installation so Oil is a bit lost."
[05:08:27] <Whirl3d> then what is going on when he says: nextSbling=parentNode.insertBefore(.....
[05:09:55] <ChrisTheSorcerer> Whirl3d: That looks like a function to get the spot right before the first child in a parent object ,alternatively a method of inserting something in front of the parent of the element you're in
[05:10:53] <Nece228> can anyone please check my code before i submit it?
[05:11:07] <Nece228> mostly for syntax, are there any ugly writing
[05:11:08] <Nece228> http://paste.opensuse.org/26012646
[05:11:28] <Nece228> or i have used "wrong" method or something
[05:12:48] <Nece228> oh by the way is there some event that if i do something, page will automatically scroll to the top?
[05:17:02] <ChrisTheSorcerer> Nece228: Depends on what you mean with "do something"
[05:17:34] <Nece228> ChrisTheSorcerer: for instance when i press the button
[05:18:07] <ChrisTheSorcerer> ?click
[05:18:07] <caniuse> ChrisTheSorcerer: .click(): Bind an event handler to the "click" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/click/
[05:18:44] <Nece228> ah i got it by myself
[05:18:55] <Nece228> animate({ scrollTop: 0 }, "slow"); did the trick
[05:19:15] <ChrisTheSorcerer> yeah, that's the function, I thought you were after the trigger >.<
[05:22:54] <blez> how to make a dblclick() handler only for elements of a div?
[05:24:20] <eddyb> is there an easy way to match all the elements in a container, between a start and a stop?
[05:25:05] <eddyb> like, I have a header
[05:25:33] <ChrisTheSorcerer> ?child
[05:25:33] <bot-t> parent > child: Selects all direct child elements specified by "child" of elements specified by "parent". http://api.jquery.com/child-selector/
[05:25:46] <eddyb> and I want to match everything until the next header
[05:26:22] <ChrisTheSorcerer> $('this').next('header').child() ??
[05:26:34] <eddyb> they are all in the same container
[05:28:30] <kapo7789> eddyb $(
[05:28:38] <eddyb> <h1></h1><p></p><p></p><p></p><h1></h1><p></p><p></p><p></p><h1></h1><p></p><p></p><p></p>
[05:28:58] <kapo7789> eddyb: $("#container *")
[05:29:04] <eddyb> what?
[05:29:07] <xec> ?nextall @ eddyb
[05:29:08] <bot-t> eddyb, .nextAll([selector]): Get all following siblings of each element in the set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/nextAll/
[05:29:25] <eddyb> xec: ok, that's the starting point

[05:29:45] <xec> ?nextuntil
[05:29:45] <bot-t> .nextUntil([selector], [filter]): Get all following siblings of each element up to but not including the element matched by the selector, DOM node, or jQuery object passed. http://api.jquery.com/nextUntil/
[05:30:00] <eddyb> xec: thanks, that's what I need :D
[05:32:13] <xec> :D
[05:33:43] <kapo7789> doesn't simple $("h1:nth-child(X) *") solve it?
[05:33:58] <eddyb> kapo7789: ffs, it's LINEAR
[05:34:18] <eddyb> h1 doesn't contain any elements
[05:34:30] <kapo7789> oh, yeah, my bad
[05:34:42] <xec> kapo7789: i love how it takes a while to understand what the selector really does, but you still call it "simple" ^^
[05:35:32] <eddyb> xec: it's actually simple
[05:35:32] <kapo7789> if i haven't notice that p isn't inside h, that doesn't mean i don't know what selector does
[05:35:42] <nFFF> lol xec :D
[05:36:27] <xec> eddyb: i live and breathe css selectors, but if you say so :)
[05:37:13] <xec> kapo7789: so, you're trying to find a h1, which is child number x and then selecting every descendant... on purpose?
[05:38:10] <eddyb> ?next
[05:38:10] <bot-t> .next([selector]): Get the immediately following sibling of each element in the set of matched elements. If a selector is provided, it retrieves the next sibling only if it matches that selector. http://api.jquery.com/next/
[05:38:49] <kapo7789> if it solves current problem, i don;t give a s.t bout the purpose. questions?
[05:39:04] <kapo7789> i was mistaken bout the html tags, that's all
[05:40:19] <xec> no offence mate, i was just trying to clarify
[05:40:55] <kapo7789> oh, ok, no problem
[05:40:59] <NodeX> lmao
[05:41:07] <NodeX> friday tensions running high
[05:42:11] <nFFF> pass around the valium
[05:42:21] <ChrisTheSorcerer> Sorry, only have morphine!
[05:42:34] <xec> lol Morphman
[05:42:49] <xec> i want some of that
[05:43:12] <Morphman> I'm serious! I have morphine, just took a pill... Then again, it's to get a serious headache down to a milder one, but still!
[05:45:50] <Morphman> Anyway, it's time for friday cake!
[05:46:32] <xec> i want some of that, too! :(
[05:53:29] <eddyb> uhm
[05:54:08] <eddyb> how can I get a callback called for every node of a container?
[05:54:20] <eddyb> including nodes of its children, and grandchildren
[05:54:44] <eddyb> something like .find().each(), but for all the nodes
[05:56:04] <eddyb> nevermind, I can do recursive .contents(), I guess
[05:57:15] <nFFF> you cand o find('*')
[06:00:56] <eddyb> nFFF: nodes and .contents()
[06:01:01] <eddyb> ?contents@nFFF
[06:01:14] <eddyb> ?contents @ nFFF
[06:01:14] <caniuse> nFFF: .contents(): Get the children of each element in the set of matched elements, including text and comment nodes. http://api.jquery.com/contents/
[06:02:57] <eddyb> !mdn HTMLTextNode
[06:03:05] <eddyb> meh :(
[06:05:07] <nFFF> I dont understand, the object, will include the text even if find is called, just not stored the same as content
[06:05:25] <nFFF> just use the .text() method
[06:06:43] <eddyb> nFFF: no, it won't
[06:07:10] <eddyb> I need text nodes
[06:07:36] <jonah> hi i just wondered if anyone could please help. I'm trying to load a div from another site into my site. I've put this code in:  http://pastebin.ca/2138246  but for some reason it's not displaying the div on my site... any help would be great.
[06:08:25] <nFFF> eddyb, yes it will
[06:08:32] <eddyb> pffft
[06:08:34] <nFFF> it just doesn't store it as  a node
[06:08:40] <eddyb> I need to perform operations on the text
[06:08:45] <eddyb> I need the actual text nodes
[06:08:58] <eddyb> .text() destroys the HTML structure
[06:10:03] <eddyb> as in, I give me back the concatenated text nodes
[06:10:35] <nFFF> ok so can't you use filter or some shiat
[06:10:42] <nFFF> against contents() to reutn the text nodes
[06:11:13] <eddyb> I used recursive .contents().each()
[06:11:55] <nFFF> would .contents().filter(function(){ return this == textnode; }); be better?
[06:12:03] <eddyb> it's not recursive
[06:14:10] <nFFF> just chain each to the end..
[06:14:14] <g0rd0n> i tried to unify/minify some jquery js files, however if i put the code in a single file things don#t work properly, in separate files all is well... what am i doing wrong?
[06:15:35] <xec> g0rd0n: maybe you're missing a semicolon at end of the a file? or they get concatenated in the wrong order?
[06:16:22] <jonah> does anybody know if it's possible to just display the 'Search availability for Galtres Lodge and book online' pink section in my site - I realise an iframe could display the page but I was hoping to just jload in that div?
[06:16:29] <jonah> http://www.visityork.org/accommodation/hotel-bnbs/York-Guest-Accommodation-Galtres-Lodge/details/?dms=2&pid=1511092
[06:17:14] <g0rd0n> xec: exact same order as when separate, and all terminate with ; or }
[06:18:29] <Nucky> Hi everybody, I'm dealing with jPlayer and songs playing in Safari but with a NaN duration. Anyone has ever gone through this?
[06:18:33] <xec> g0rd0n: well, i'm fresh out of guesses :) what exactly does "doesn't work properly" mean though?
[06:18:46] <freeed> g0rd0n, are they multiple plugins? or just functions?
[06:19:04] <g0rd0n> xec: i get errors like "blabla is undefined"
[06:19:14] <g0rd0n> freeed: there is one function, the other are plugins
[06:20:29] <freeed> g0rd0n, make sure each plugin is wrapped in (function($){ â€¦ })(jQuery);  and all your functions are in a single or multiple .ready() method or similar
[06:21:15] <g0rd0n> freeed: is /function(jQuery) {
[06:21:16] <g0rd0n> oh shit
[06:21:19] <g0rd0n> i think i see the problem now
[06:22:14] <freeed> g0rd0n, well that should work as well
[06:22:39] <g0rd0n> yeah but i have one .ready call :)
[06:25:51] <g0rd0n> damn, still doesn't work
[06:26:05] <g0rd0n> using yui compressor btw
[06:26:27] <raj> shoky, where you at yo?
[06:30:24] <bambams-vpsdown> jQuery(":span"); /// <--- that is never a valid selector, correct? :\
[06:30:58] <xec> it could be a custom selector
[06:31:30] <snover> never use custom selectors.
[06:32:11] <freeed> g0rd0n, not sure if this would help or not, but I've had issues with YUI before and switched to uglify http://marijnhaverbeke.nl/uglifyjs
[06:32:13] <xec> so the answer is "incorrect, but likely"
[06:33:07] <xec> as in likely *not* a valid selector
[06:36:33] <shoky> raj here. just woke up ;p
[06:36:38] <gnagno> hello all
[06:36:46] <hyperstream> Kia Ora
[06:36:57] <raj> 4:30pm?
[06:37:00] <raj> solid night I guess
[06:37:04] <shoky> yeh ;)
[06:37:05] <raj> :)
[06:37:10] <Woet> i thought that was a new car made by kia, hyperstream
[06:37:17] <shoky> wazup
[06:37:55] <gnagno> can I use .animate() to animate more than one element on a page at the same time?
[06:38:13] <xec> yes
[06:38:22] <hyperstream> Woet, well it would defiantly be the first quality Kia to be produced
[06:38:31] <Woet> hyperstream: my kia is pretty good, to be honest.
[06:38:31] <gnagno> xec, yes was for me?
[06:38:34] <claudio> gnagno, $("selector1, selector2")
[06:38:34] <xec> yes
[06:39:16] <xec> gnagno: i know it's a very general answer, but it was a very general question :)
[06:39:19] <gnagno> claudio, ok... but I need to make different animations on each element... (sorry, I didn't explain the problem correctly)
[06:39:22] <hyperstream> Woet, its a Kia ....
[06:39:27] <Woet> hyperstream: so what? :)
[06:39:34] <hyperstream> Woet, dude you type so friggen fast wtf
[06:39:40] <hyperstream> its like talking to an AI bot.
[06:39:41] <raj> shoky, I was about to ask about another quirk in the slider, but someone in #css just pointed out why it was happening
[06:39:43] <Woet> hyperstream: :(
[06:39:47] <Woet> hyperstream: I take offense to that
[06:39:51] <IconicSchema> lol
[06:39:54] <hyperstream> Woet, abnormal dude. looks like i need a kia
[06:39:59] <claudio> gnagno, well, different animation, different animate()
[06:40:03] <Woet> hyperstream: I don't think it's really related.
[06:40:03] <hyperstream> fml
[06:40:04] <gnagno> xec and claudio if I use $("#selector1, #selector2").animate() I will have the same animation on both
[06:40:19] <gnagno> claudio, with different animate the 2 animations will not happen at the same time
[06:40:35] <hyperstream> Woet, even grammer and puncution is good <-- how ar eyou dealing wif dis lawt?
[06:40:44] <Woet> hyperstream: probably experience
[06:40:46] <gnagno> I would like to make when one element is enlarging the other one to shrink
[06:40:50] <hyperstream> Woet, :)
[06:40:52] <claudio> gnagno, "same time" it's an hard concept
[06:40:52] <Woet> hyperstream: if it's your job and your hobby you end up typing ~ 10 hours per day minimum
[06:41:01] <hyperstream> Woet, jebbus'
[06:41:06] <hyperstream> Woet, faster than i can think ><
[06:41:07] <claudio> gnagno, mmmh, maybe you could use queues?
[06:41:22] <hyperstream> Woet, what do you do for job ?
[06:41:32] <gnagno> claudio, I think will queues they will be concatenated
[06:41:36] <xec> claudio, gnagno: or just *not* queue
[06:41:58] <shoky> raj- so you stuck with jqui slider?
[06:42:15] <JAAulde> So on the docs/demos page for UI autocomplete, many of the demos show the `_renderItem` method being overridden after making an instance of the widget. This is done by asking for the instance from the element's data, and writing to that property. Why don't they just expose that as an option since they clearly feel the need to customize it a lot?
[06:42:44] <raj> shoky, yeah, cuz the other 2 sliders I looked at had the same issue
[06:42:45] <gnagno> xec, what do you mean with *not* queue? is it possible?
[06:42:47] <raj> surprisingly
[06:43:14] <ub|k> hello
[06:43:17] <hyperstream> ello
[06:43:21] <hyperstream> ^ fast
[06:43:23] <xec> gnagno: yes, "queue" is an option you can set to false. not sure if this is good practice though
[06:43:36] <xec> ?animate @ gnagno
[06:43:36] <bot-t> gnagno, .animate(properties, [duration], [easing], [complete]): Perform a custom animation of a set of CSS properties. http://api.jquery.com/animate/
[06:44:01] <g0rd0n> freeed: thanks, just tried uglify but i get the same result
[06:44:06] <Woet> hyperstream: system engineer, network engineer, linux/windows engineer, web dev and  PHP
[06:44:08] <xec> the second form is .animate(properties, options)
[06:44:35] <hyperstream> Woet, explains it. *tips his hat*
[06:44:41] <gnagno> xec, ok I will try that, thanks
[06:46:06] <freeed> g0rd0n, this is a file from a current project that I've put multiple plugins and jquery in - sounds like what you're trying.. maybe this will help: http://www.pastie.org/3822777
[06:46:40] <nicesukhi> any jquery plugin to stylize forms?
[06:46:41] <nicesukhi> any jquery plugin to stylize HTML forms?
[06:46:45] <ub|k> is there a way to specify that a binding be executed only if the argument fulfills certain conditions? i mean, a live binding in which only part of the selector is initially specified and the other part is checked in runtime
[06:47:45] <shoky> Woet you want animations on two different elements?
[06:47:52] <shoky> cause that happens at the same time..
[06:47:54] <ub|k> like `$('#elem').on('click', '.class')` but in which `.class` applies to `#elem` itself in addition to the descendents
[06:47:57] <nicesukhi> how to stylize html select tag?
[06:47:58] <xec> ub|k: with .on() you can filter by selector, if that's what you mean
[06:48:03] <ub|k> *descendants
[06:48:29] <eddyb> is there a way to split up elements? like have <b>a<br>b</b> turn into <b>a</b><b>b</b> and <i><b>a<br>b</b></i> turn into <i><b>a</b></i><i><b>b</b></i>
[06:48:33] <Woet> shoky: excuse me?
[06:48:49] <eddyb> <br> is what I'm splitting by, and there would be a top container that wouldn't be split
[06:48:50] <ub|k> xec: i want the binding to be executed only if #elem accomplishes some criterion, withouth having to add an if inside the handler
[06:49:09] <shoky> err sorry. gnagno, not Woet
[06:49:25] <Woet> shoky: we both have an "o" in our nicks, I understand the confusion
[06:49:55] <shoky> different kind ;p
[06:49:57] <eddyb> actually, it would be better to get an array. have <b>a<br>b</b> turn into [<b>a</b>, <b>b</b>] and <i><b>a<br>b</b></i> turn into [<i><b>a</b></i>, <i><b>b</b></i>]
[06:50:05] <gnagno> shoky, yes... I want animations on two diff elements.... but I am having issues
[06:50:14] <eddyb> is that simple?
[06:50:23] <shoky> gnagno: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/zckqC/
[06:50:35] <xec> ub|k: well, bind to the parent, something like $(document).on("click", "#id.class",func..)
[06:50:40] <gnagno> thank you shoky
[06:50:49] <xec> a parent*
[06:50:58] <xec> an ancestor*
[06:51:15] <xec> you know what i mean :D
[06:51:18] <ub|k> xec, yeah, that could work... i was just wondering whether there was a better way to do it
[06:51:19] <gnagno> shoky, what if you want to make the second animation relative to a parameter of the first one?
[06:51:21] <ub|k> yes i do :)
[06:51:26] <ub|k> ok, thx
[06:51:30] <shoky> gnagno what do you mean
[06:52:15] <gnagno> shoky, for example make the second bloc shrink the amount of pixels the first one enlarged
[06:52:40] <shoky> um
[06:53:11] <shoky> then you'd have to give .animate the right parameters../
[06:54:02] <gnagno> shoky, starting from this http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/zckqC/ make the 2 divs stay always connected for example
[06:54:09] <eddyb> xec: can I have that?
[06:54:22] <shoky> gnagno you'd have to be more specific with what you want
[06:54:48] <eddyb> I really want to parse this bloody ES5 spec and I really don't want to write a state machine for HTML
[06:55:19] <shoky> gnagno they're connected ;p http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/zckqC/1/
[06:55:39] <xec> eddyb: i'm sorry, have what?
[06:55:57] <eddyb> have <b>a<br>b</b> turn into [<b>a</b>, <b>b</b>] and <i><b>a<br>b</b></i> turn into [<i><b>a</b></i>, <i><b>b</b></i>]
[06:56:07] <eddyb> where <br> is the element to split by
[06:56:28] <shoky> easy to do that by yourself
[06:56:30] <eddyb> it's cell division with HTML
[06:56:37] <quicksilver> eddyb: clone the entire thing, and then delete the part to the left of the br in one half, and the part to the right in the other half.
[06:56:53] <xec> i don't know any easy way myself
[06:57:18] <eddyb> the problem is that I can have any vertical structure
[06:57:28] <eddyb> and any number of <br>s anywhere in there
[06:57:44] <eddyb> I need to split and stitch it back together
[06:58:02] <shoky> =programming
[06:58:27] <eddyb> hmm, I could traverse upwards from each <br>
[06:58:39] <xec> well. i like quicksilver's approach
[06:58:50] <eddyb> quicksilver: won't work that good for me
[06:59:07] <xec> split contents on <br> and clone the structure for each
[06:59:31] <eddyb> I think creating a new element and just moving the part to the right of the <br> into that element is the best idea
[06:59:47] <eddyb> since I will have the same elements, just under a different structure
[07:00:13] <xec> i think we just phrased it differently
[07:00:28] <eddyb> maybe
[07:01:09] <eddyb> what I don't want to do is close the elements to the right of the <br>, because I can end up cloning a <br> that will be processed later
[07:01:20] <eddyb> ?nextAll

[07:04:43] <honey> hi
[07:05:03] <xec> eddyb: .clone() is a deep copy (so no). but you could just overwrite whatever inside
[07:05:50] <eddyb> it's not like I'm killing kittens by creating and destroying all those cloned nodes :P
[07:06:32] <xec> no, i like to imagine it's more like torturing puppies :)

[07:27:23] <eddyb> yes, just do $(html), or $('<div>').html(html)
[07:27:42] <rza> so i can use $(html).find(...);
[07:27:43] <rza> etc
[07:27:45] <eddyb> the second should be faster, and should also create an encapsulation
[07:28:04] <rza> encapsulation?
[07:28:08] <eddyb> s/should also/also/
[07:28:22] <blez> how to get the first child?
[07:28:29] <blez> .children(":first-child") returns me <input button ..><div>.. </div>
[07:28:56] <eddyb> rza: yeah, so you have an element with your html in it. that way you don't lose any text that isn't in an element
[07:29:08] <eddyb> s/element/tag/ // whatever
[07:29:19] <eddyb> blez: .children(':first'), I think
[07:30:05] <blez> ":first" also gives me some divs
[07:30:27] <blez> I guess it parses it until </
[07:30:38] <blez> and my <input type='button'> has no </
[07:30:52] <eddyb> blez: it doesn't parse anything
[07:31:02] <eddyb> it uses the DOM
[07:31:05] <blez> aha
[07:31:14] <blez> what's wrong then ..
[07:32:54] <shoky> if what you had before .children(':first')  has more than one element..
[07:33:02] <shoky> then you could get more than one first child
[07:33:49] <blez> aha
[07:33:52] <shoky> like pharaoh and them jews
[07:33:57] <rza> hmm find doesnt work on that html
[07:33:58] <blez> and how to get only one?
[07:34:16] <blez> only the first 'first-child'
[07:34:16] <shoky> select only one element
[07:34:33] <blez> alert($(this).children(":first").html());
[07:34:40] <shoky> $(...........).eq(0).children(':first')
[07:34:44] <blez> aha
[07:35:20] <blez> still returns me divs
[07:36:42] <shoky> that sounds odd.
[07:38:30] <shoky> also use .val()
[07:38:34] <shoky> to get the value
[07:39:01] <blez> that's the problem, val doesn't work
[07:39:06] <blez> attr("value") too
[07:39:15] <blez> so I guess that's because of the divs

[07:41:33] <thomedy> is someone in here working
[07:41:45] <shoky> ?
[07:42:03] <shoky> if you're paying
[07:42:10] <thomedy> hey shoky... i have been stumped on a thing so much so that i have no idea even what to google because i dont know what the issue is
[07:42:21] <shoky> ;)
[07:42:22] <thomedy> but my slide show animates more then i want it to....
[07:42:26] <thomedy> im going to paste bin
[07:42:26] <shoky> ;S
[07:42:28] <thomedy> and link the site
[07:42:30] <thomedy> please help
[07:42:36] <shoky> i'll try..
[07:42:44] <take_it_t> im trying to stick to the plugin authoring guidelines as best i can, but i need to setup a global timer that all instances of my plugin can reference, is there a suggested way of doing this without adding a second object to the jquery namespace?
[07:43:04] <shoky> add it to your plugin's namespace?
[07:43:10] <thomedy> http://pastebin.com/hSsjDHMD
[07:43:20] <thomedy> www.thesartorer.com
[07:43:24] <thomedy> sorry
[07:43:35] <thomedy> thesartorer.com/?q=menswear
[07:43:54] <shoky> womens no good?
[07:44:04] <thomedy> ?
[07:44:13] <blez> shoky http://jsfiddle.net/3zdn5/
[07:44:15] <shoky> nm
[07:44:19] <blez> drag a button, then click it
[07:44:26] <thomedy> oh are you talking about the grammar
[07:44:42] <thomedy> nm ... i am on a task
[07:44:50] <shoky> no, about the pictures ;)
[07:44:59] <thomedy> oh sorry yeah
[07:45:10] <thomedy> its a fashion site
[07:45:23] <thomedy> but thats me justifying a hot girl pic... i know im sorry
[07:45:37] <thomedy> anyway
[07:45:37] <take_it_t> shoky : doing it that way means that everytime my plugin is called it's going to start a new timer which is pretty inefficient and unnecessary, i realize i could do it $.fn.myPlugin.myTimer, but that goes against the plugin authoring guidelines
[07:45:42] <anli_> Is there a way to emulate placeholder in browsers that are pre html5?
[07:45:48] <thomedy> if you click an image and it opens a slideshow on the left
[07:45:52] <thomedy> it works the first time
[07:45:57] <anli_> So I can have default text, would be great if its gray
[07:46:05] <thomedy> but every click  increases the animate() count
[07:46:08] <thomedy> thats ?????
[07:46:18] <risky_s> how does one calculate percentage in JS ?
[07:46:20] <thomedy> i tried e.stopPropogate but i was just guessing
[07:46:41] <risky_s> for instance if I want to deduct a percantage of a number?
[07:46:46] <thomedy> x/100 = yournumber/yourdivisor
[07:46:50] * blez pokes shoky
[07:47:11] <thomedy> that essentialy is what percentage is my number divided by what its out of
[07:47:14] <risky_s> cheers
[07:47:58] <thomedy> dang my freakin schedule is so tight have you made any progress shoky...? and im super sorry to rush you but im going to have to get off... if not i cant blame you debugging suks
[07:49:32] <thomedy> okay sorry i know your doing a favor for me but i gotta go i have been doing this on my break at work and thats over now
[07:49:47] <shoky> thomedy currenty i've managed to reproduce the problem ;)
[07:49:52] <shoky> if you wnat a progress report.
[07:52:22] <shoky> thomedy the prob is
[07:52:32] <shoky> all of your code is inside one big click handler
[07:52:54] <shoky> you bind the left/right buttons to animate, but you do this on EVERY time that you click the images on the right
[07:53:14] <shoky> so you bind the left/right click events again each time
[07:53:35] <shoky> take the left/right click binding outside of the big click handler
[07:53:39] <shoky> just put it in the domready
[07:54:35] <shoky> oh he's not here wtf.
[08:01:08] <shoky> blez i dunno what you want
[08:07:41] <xwurf> hi, i use $(document).keyup(function(e) { } in oder to trigger an event if a special key is pressed. But when i press this key, the event is executed multiple times...
[08:08:06] <xwurf> any idea how to prevent this?
[08:08:40] <xwurf> i mean, even if i press the key only once, the event is executed multiple times (the number of times is undeterministic)
[08:12:11] <anli_> Why is there no foo.hasAttr method?
[08:14:51] <eddyb> ?hasAttr

[08:17:11] <shoky> anli_:  foo.attr('bar') !== undefined
[08:17:57] <eddyb> I'm fed up with this shitty HTML
[08:18:15] <xwurf> @shoky: its to complex for a live demo
[08:18:42] <shoky> xwurf if it's executed multiple times then i guess you binded the event multiple times
[08:18:54] <shoky> or something else fishy is going on
[08:19:18] <shoky> other than that i can't help without a demo..
[08:23:39] <xwurf> @shocky: i have observed the following:
[08:23:41] <FunnyLookinHat> With .draggable() - is there a way to make sure that a span that's display:inline-block can only be dragged around on a specific line of text? So that after dragging it - the position will put it back on the line ?
[08:24:25] <xwurf> when i use $(document).keyup(function(e) { } the event is triggered multiple times, when i use $("#id").keyup(function(e) { }  the event is triggered only once
[08:25:36] <shoky> xwurf, you may re-read my last response
[08:26:34] <xwurf> yes, i have read it
[08:26:42] <shoky> k
[08:28:06] <jeffsmykil> I am having issues appending <options> to a <select> that is not in the dom on page load in IE 7 and IE 8
[08:28:32] <xwurf> @shocky: but the prob is with '#id' i can execute the event exactly once.
[08:28:46] <xwurf> all further key-press are just ignored it seems
[08:29:19] <xwurf> only if i refresh the page, i can reexecute the key-press successfully
[08:30:24] <xwurf> the situation is further as follow: if i press the key, the '#id' is replaced (ajax-update)
[08:30:34] <xwurf> maybe this is the reason why more than one keypress does not work
[08:30:53] <xwurf> but the replacement id is the same
[08:31:05] <shoky> then use .on() to bind it , delegating the event to a container element that doesn't get replaced/destroyed
[08:31:08] <shoky> see ?on
[08:31:08] <bot-t> .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements, including delegation and live binding. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[08:31:16] <shoky> especially the part about delegating events.
[08:31:34] <xwurf> ok ty
[08:32:54] <smykes> I'm having issues adding <option> to a <select> that wasn't there when the dom loaded in IE 7 and IE 8
[08:33:02] <smykes> Has anyone had any similar experience?
[08:33:04] <shoky> yes you said that
[08:33:08] <shoky> ?ask
[08:33:09] <bot-t> If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[08:33:37] <smykes> There is a question there
[08:33:44] <shoky> we all have issues
[08:34:12] <xwurf> @shoky: ok, it seems it works fine with $('body') instead of $(document)
[08:35:06] <smykes> shoky how about this specific issue
[08:35:36] <shoky> smykes what issue is that?
[08:35:58] <RichardP> can anyone recommend a good ajax file uploader?
[08:36:03] <RichardP> I need to replace uploadify
[08:36:08] <smykes> The fact that the previously described issue results in a scipt error in IE 7 and IE 8
[08:36:26] <shoky> it give eror
[08:36:43] <shoky> at least you're a bit more specific now
[08:37:40] <shoky> but i still don't see you getting any help from anyone

[08:38:49] <smykes> I understand, I'm in here enough to know that most times you want a demo, I am asking if anyone has had a similar experience before I make a demo no need to be a tool about it
[08:39:07] <shoky> i know you understand
[08:39:21] <shoky> then why did i have to nudge you so much to get an actual error report from you
[08:39:32] <shoky> you're the tool
[08:39:34] <shoky> ;)
[08:39:38] <shoky> jk.
[08:39:45] <shoky> if you fiddle it i can try to help
[08:39:54] <shoky> otherwise i still doubt you'll get much help

[08:41:34] <sqwk> Is there a guide on when JS becomes to heavy for a page? Obviously faster is better, but when will a user wonder what is happening? Getting console.time() times of about 100msâ€¦
[08:41:49] <smykes> shoky it appears to stem from using a selector like this $("#foo" + i)
[08:42:19] <shoky> i thought it stems from adding <option> to <select>
[08:42:32] <smykes> it is
[08:42:40] <shoky> k
[08:42:42] <smykes> but im refering to the select in that manner
[08:42:54] * shoky shrugs
[08:43:06] <IconicSchema> RichardP check this baby out: http://blueimp.github.com/jQuery-File-Upload/
[08:46:03] <Mkop> any know of guidelines for performance of $(".class") vs $("element.class")?
[08:46:31] <Mkop> specifically, if my .class's are always of a given element type, will I help performance by specifying the element type?
[08:46:40] <Mkop> s/element type/tag name/g
[08:46:42] <RichardP> IconicSchema: im pretty sure i just came in my panties, thanks :D
[08:46:49] <shoky> lol
[08:47:03] <shoky> so that's what the P is for
[08:59:11] <vpv4oo> im using $.('#pagecontent').fadeOut('fast').load('second.php').hide().fadeIn('fast'); how do i attach a JS function after the last fadeIn has happened? [...].fadeIn('fast', function() { ... }); does that work?
[08:59:20] <Tasser> can I show a transparent element, but capture mouse movements one layer below? or is that a security risk?
[09:01:40] <faraway> vpv4oo: if you try you will see that it works ;)
[09:01:50] <jnettik> does anyone know how I would add an effect to an element that's created by jquery? i'm using jquery 1.3.2 (not able to upgrade)
[09:02:01] <vpv4oo> faraway: i just tried, it doesnt
[09:02:26] <vpv4oo> faraway: but that might have a different cause of failure, checking...
[09:02:32] <faraway> vpv4oo: then something else does not work probably
[09:03:03] <jnettik> I can't do $('selector').effect(); because my selector doesn't exist yet when the document loads
[09:04:05] <vpv4oo> faraway: can i attach a function like that on basically any function call? getScript('blah.js', function() { ... } ); and it will always be performed when previous action is done?
[09:06:06] <faraway> Tasser: only the top most elements get mouse events. there is a non standard function document.elementFromPoint i know this functions works in FF 3 and above (don't know if other browsers also support it now) with that you could hide the overlaying element if you get a mouse move on it and then look for the corresponding element and then show it again
[09:07:10] <faraway> vpv4oo: imho  only the effects are queued  the others take place immediately
[09:09:24] <faraway> Tasser: sorry it is a standard function but it is was not implemented by many browsers
[09:09:48] <Tasser> faraway, looks like no one cares about the standard?
[09:10:49] <Tasser> so I could calculate the size of the underlying element, and grab the absolute or relative position to calculate wherever the mouse is still on the element below
[09:10:49] <vpv4oo> its weird. i have openlayers map material integrated, before it was $.getScript("OpenLayers.js", function(){ loadOSMmap(); }); which worked. im trying to change it not to be dependent on the script loading, since i want to do that in the .php with <script src=""></script>, but whatever else i bind the loadmap funtions to it wont load anymore
[09:10:50] <faraway> Tasser: yea that why it is great to have people working on jquery. cause otherwise you would take care about the this incompatibilities yourself
[09:11:06] <Tasser> faraway, :-)
[09:11:38] <Misterno> hello
[09:11:48] <Jon30> hi. I am trying to access a function that is located within ;(function ($) { .......  something.function = function(blah,blah) { }  ... })(jQuery);
[09:12:33] <faraway> Tasser: http://www.quirksmode.org/dom/w3c_cssom.html#documentview  seems that its supported now. haven't looked at it for some years :D
[09:13:26] <chilversc_> Jon30: how is 'something' defined?
[09:13:28] <faraway> Tasser: http://www.zehnet.de/2010/11/19/document-elementfrompoint-a-jquery-solution/ could be interresting
[09:16:05] <Jon30> chilversc: something is an object like <ul>
[09:16:24] <Jon30> I think.
[09:16:40] <Jon30> I am trying to access a function within flexslider.
[09:17:02] <Tasser> faraway, the basic idea is to have a magnified version of the image hovering over the current one, but remove the magnified one once the cursor leaves the small one
[09:18:03] <faraway> Tasser: then probably checking the bounds of the smaller one at the mouse move over the big one would be a faster and easier solution
[09:20:19] <Tasser> faraway, got any nice links for that one too? Looks like jQuery provides pageX only - so get the coordinates of the smaller one and check?
[09:20:20] <faraway> Tasser: btw. "pointer-events:none"  but this is supported only in 3.6+ safari 4+ and chrome as far as i know.
[09:20:35] <Tasser> good enough
[09:21:04] <Tasser> so it will pass-through pointer events?
[09:21:12] <Tasser> and I suppose that's CSS.
[09:21:30] <Jon30> chilversc_
[09:21:35] <faraway> Tasser: it is a css. and yes it should but i never really used it. so i don't know about mouse move events
[09:22:02] <shoky> i've used the document.elementFromPoint method successfully
[09:22:03] <Tasser> aaaand it works in firefox too
[09:22:17] <shoky> i put z-index -10000, then document.elementFromPoint, then z-index back to what it was
[09:22:29] <shoky> and it works in all browsers i've tried
[09:22:57] <faraway> Tasser: forgot the ff infront of the 3.6+ :D
[09:27:14] <jnettik> so is it not possible to query for an element that jquery creates?
[09:27:29] <shoky> sure it is
[09:27:49] <Tasser> faraway, http://jsfiddle.net/drKpE/ \o/
[09:27:51] <shoky> you need to knwo where you're querying though
[09:28:19] <jnettik> shoky: like what element i'm looking for?
[09:28:33] <shoky> no
[09:28:40] <shoky> the context for the query
[09:28:46] <shoky> by default it is the 'body' element
[09:28:48] <LukeNukem> is there a equivalent function to htmlentities
[09:28:49] <LukeNukem> in jquery
[09:29:23] <shoky> er sorry default is document root
[09:30:43] <faraway> Tasser: one thing you need to keep in mind, it could be irritating to the user. (but this depends on the situation) you should check the reaction of someone
[09:30:57] <jnettik> shoky: so I have an element with a class of "cursor" that I want to do a toggle on. jquery creates that element so how would I target that?
[09:31:09] <shoky> what do you mean jquery creates it?
[09:31:10] <jnettik> the normal way doesn't seem to work
[09:31:27] <Tasser> faraway, oke
[09:31:38] <shoky> $('<div />').toggleClass.....
[09:32:17] <jnettik> i'm using a jquery plugin that crates it with $('<span class="cursor" />')
[09:33:14] <shoky> if the element is in the DOM you can do a regular query for it
[09:33:30] <shoky> if you have a reference to that span you can do a regular query on it
[09:33:40] <shoky> if you have neither of those then you're using a weird plugin./
[09:34:29] <jnettik> shoky: i've tried $('.cursor').toggle(); and no luck
[09:35:03] <jnettik> my guess is that it's cause .cursor doesn't exist when the document loads?
[09:35:15] <shoky> no need to guess
[09:35:26] <shoky> but i sure cant know that from here
[09:36:29] <jnettik> yeah.
[09:36:37] <shoky> so run your query when it IS in the dom?
[09:37:06] <Jon30> I am trying to access a function within a jquery plugin. flexslider is the plugin. how would i do that?
[09:38:11] <chilversc_> Jon30: normally you can't that's the whole point of wrapping it in a function like that, it makes it private
[09:38:44] <chilversc_> Jon30: if something had been a global object, then you could access it through that, eg, if it was node and that was exports
[09:39:01] <chilversc_> Jon30: or, if it is jQuery.fn.something
[09:40:01] <jnettik> shoky: found where I need to call my query from. thank you for your help
[09:40:11] <Jon30> chilversc_: when the plugin loads, i want to call the animate function in order for the slideshow to start from a specific slide.
[09:40:17] <Jon30> any ideas on how to achieve that?
[09:40:54] <chilversc_> Jon30: depends on the plugin and how it sets itself up
[09:41:26] <chilversc_> Jon30: if that's the function you need, then look at how/where that function is exposed by the plugin
[09:42:21] <Jon30> brb sorry
[09:46:56] <kenperkins> single page app theory question: if you are on /home, and you click on a link to /home, should that put an entry into history?
[09:47:02] <kenperkins> or just trigger the async data load
[09:48:00] <shoky> refreshing a page doesn't usually put it in history i think
[09:48:22] <shoky> but it'd really depend on how you want your app to behave..
[09:49:10] <kenperkins> for example backbone.js explicitly does nothing
[09:49:16] <kenperkins> when you navigate to the same url as you're already on
[09:49:21] <kenperkins> (which I think is kind of wrong)
[09:49:59] <shoky> dunno backbone too much.. sry
[09:50:23] <kenperkins> no prob
[09:51:32] <aberrant> hi all
[09:51:45] <aberrant> is there a good tutorial on how to toggle display of multiple divs on a page?
[09:52:10] <shoky> jquery tutorial is good
[09:55:12] <kolix> hey guys
[09:55:16] <kolix> i have a dilemma
[09:55:23] <kolix> need your input/suggestions
[09:55:27] <shoky> i've got a big dilemma
[09:55:30] <shoky> about my big leg emma
[09:55:33] <shoky> woo hoooooo
[09:55:36] <shoky> yea woo hooooo
[09:55:46] <jholloman> hah, having too much fun shoky
[09:55:47] <kolix> So i have an html form that i need to submit with ajax WITHOUT redirecting the page
[09:55:56] <shoky> lol.
[09:56:11] <jholloman> if it has to be form submission you can submit in a hidden irame
[09:56:38] <jholloman> or you can just use ajax and not actually use submit
[09:57:06] <kolix> i like the hidden iframe idea
[09:57:25] <shoky> it's old and clunky ;)
[09:57:35] <kolix> have any boile rplate code on how to do this?
[09:57:37] <jholloman> yeah that i wouldn't recomend as first choice
[09:57:49] <shoky> kolix it's straightforward
[09:57:50] <jholloman> i only know of that for file upload that looks like ajax
[09:57:59] <shoky> <iframe style="display:none">
[09:58:18] <jholloman> clone all of the form to the iframe, and then submit
[09:58:23] <kolix> well i also have a submit button that needs actually submit the form to a new page lol
[09:58:27] <kolix> (don't ask)
[09:58:36] <shoky> form.submit()
[09:58:43] <kolix> basically, the ajax would be used to save/update changes to new php autmatically
[09:58:56] <kolix> and the submit button would actually submit it to a new page
[09:59:06] <kolix> so i need to do both with same html elements
[09:59:22] <jholloman> yeah so use the clone function
[09:59:30] <jholloman> to copy the elements and place them into the iframe
[09:59:39] <jholloman> just be weary that some inputs like file input
[09:59:40] <kolix> ok
[09:59:41] <jholloman> you cannot clone
[09:59:50] <kolix> no, they're all text inputs
[09:59:51] <jholloman> so if you're using anything other than basic entry
[10:00:01] <kolix> ok, so how do i use clone?
[10:00:07] <shoky> if it's just to save/update changes to php..
[10:00:19] <shoky> why use form submission and not $.post or smth
[10:00:37] <kolix> becuz i need both =\
[10:00:40] <shoky> so do both
[10:00:49] <shoky> no need for clunky iframes
[10:00:55] <jholloman> do the post then on return do submit
[10:01:00] <jholloman> or post then on return change pages
[10:01:23] <kolix> but i need this clone function though because the html form input texts are generated dynamically with php
[10:01:46] <shoky> o.O
[10:01:53] <kolix> so if there's a way i can copy the entire dynamic form into an iframe and submit that then thatw ould be easiest for me
[10:04:35] <kolix> hmm
[10:04:45] <kolix> can i just submit the form quitly in the background?
[10:04:51] <kolix> quiety
[10:04:59] <shoky> background==iframe?
[10:05:11] <kolix> my only problem is that the post data is dynamic
[10:05:25] <kolix> so i can't do a standard $.post
[10:05:31] <shoky> i don't see why not
[10:08:27] <kolix> ok so here goes
[10:08:37] <kolix> i have an html form with id="form_recalc"
[10:08:46] <kolix> how do i clone this to an iframe?
[10:09:30] <shoky> something like  $('#myIframe').html( $('#form_recalc').clone() )
[10:09:45] <jholloman> ?clone
[10:09:46] <bot-t> .clone([withDataAndEvents]): Create a deep copy of the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/clone/
[10:09:47] <kolix> $('form_recalc').clone().appendTo('#hiddeniframe');
[10:09:56] <kolix> ?
[10:10:13] <shoky> #
[10:10:45] <kolix> cool
[10:10:47] <kolix> $('#myIframe').html( $('#form_recalc').clone() )
[10:10:54] <shoky> sory not .html
[10:10:55] <kolix> much better
[10:11:00] <shoky> er unless it works
[10:11:05] <kolix> innerHTML?
[10:11:11] <kolix> i haven't tried it yet
[10:12:16] <kolix> ok
[10:12:25] <kolix> so let's say i got everything cloned and in the iframe
[10:12:46] <kolix> how can i submit this form in the iframe?
[10:14:19] <shoky> $('#hiddeniframe #form_recalc')[0].submit()
[10:14:44] <kolix> thanks dude
[10:15:55] <shoky> np
[10:17:19] <m3t4> Hello, i have this code http://jsfiddle.net/qK8fC/ everthing works good, but only in if statement else not working
[10:18:20] <shoky> not working?
[10:18:25] <m3t4> yes
[10:18:30] <shoky> ?
[10:18:58] <m3t4> no reaction
[10:19:13] <shoky> none
[10:19:38] <shoky> i don't know any bugs regarding 'if' in javascript, sorry
[10:20:39] <kolix> shoky, one more qucik question
[10:20:48] <m3t4> hm... strange problem looks like else not exist
[10:20:56] <shoky> looks like?
[10:21:17] <kolix> if i cloned the html form first, will it still hold the new data the user entered?
[10:21:31] <kolix> or do i need to clone each time i want to submit?
[10:21:50] <shoky> clone clones the values too i believe
[10:21:57] <shoky> at the time of the clone
[10:22:16] <kolix> so ill need to clone each time i want the new data?
[10:23:09] <shoky> i dont know what you NEED to do man. like i told you it sounds like yer doin things the wrong way
[10:28:40] <kolix> lol ok ONE more ('im new to jquery, sorry)
[10:29:21] <kolix> $('#hiddeniframe #form_recalc')[0].submit()
[10:29:34] <kolix> how do i change the action of #form_recalc in the iframe?
[10:30:18] <shoky> var form = $('#hiddeniframe #form_recalc')[0];
[10:30:24] <shoky> form.action = 'wow'
[10:30:54] <kolix> then
[10:30:59] <kolix> form.submit()?
[10:31:11] <shoky> if you want to submit it
[10:31:16] <Wilornel> Guys, is there a event when the user selects a file?
[10:31:33] <systemfault> Wilornel: "change"?
[10:31:40] <Wilornel> onchange() ?
[10:32:09] <Wilornel> like you know the user clicks: browser, then he selects his file
[10:32:10] <systemfault> .on('change', function(event) { dosomethinghere; });
[10:32:23] <Wilornel> oh Alright ok thanks
[10:33:23] <Jon30> chilversc_: I am trying to access the flexAnimate function in this plugin: http://pastebin.com/YpA57RQu
[10:35:02] <kolix> it works dude
[10:35:15] <kolix> BUT, my iframe is still submitting to a new page
[10:38:15] <shoky> Jon30:   $(...).flexslider().slideAnimate(....)
[10:39:53] <saml> how can I select all elements with class foo and bar?
[10:40:00] <saml> jQuery(".foo .bar") ?
[10:40:55] <saml> jQuery(".foo.bar") !
[10:41:12] <Jon30> shoky: I get an error saying "$("#libNav").flexAnimate is not a function"
[10:41:23] <Jon30> unless i a mment to put something else inside $(...)
[10:41:52] <kolix> shoky: thanks for all your help dude
[10:41:56] <kolix> my problem is solved :)
[10:44:04] <shoky> Jon30: sorry i misunderstood the code. but i see you can access .flexAnimate in the flexslider callbacks
[10:44:23] <Jon30> shoky: can you explain further please?
[10:44:40] <Jon30> oh
[10:44:53] <Jon30> the start, after, end etc
[10:44:56] <shoky> yeah
[10:45:27] <Jon30> that's what i was trying to achieve, but i am having trouble accessing flexAnimate fromwithin start:
[10:45:39] <Jon30> "start:"
[10:45:57] <aberrant> silly question: I have ids of the format "aN" where N is a number from 1 - 12. They're bound to .click that toggles an id of "daN" where N is the same number Is there a way to create a single function to handle all 12 cases or am I stuck repeating the code 12 times?
[10:46:04] <shoky> if you jsfiddle it i'll try too..
[10:46:26] <aberrant> example here: 		$("#a1").click(function() {
[10:46:27] <aberrant> 			$("#da1").fadeToggle("fast","swing");
[10:46:28] <aberrant> 			});
[10:46:39] <NoiseEee> aberrant: look into 'event delegation', but perhaps you might consider using a common class rather than id1-12
[10:46:50] <NoiseEee> aberrant: but that depends on what you're doing.
[10:47:05] <aberrant> noiseee: I have a bunch of headers that toggle descriptive text on a page when clicked.
[10:47:14] <aberrant> each "header" has its own text
[10:47:27] <Jon30> for exmaple, i added "$('#libNav').flexAnimate(1, false, true);" inside start: and i am getting an error: $("#libNav").flexAnimate is not a function
[10:47:41] <aberrant> so if I click on "a4" I want the div in "da4" to be shown / hidden
[10:47:47] <Wilornel> Guys, I am tring to send a file to another .php file so that this php file could upload the file to the server. Usually, through forms it is pretty simple... But now I do not want to change the webpage just to upload a file
[10:47:54] <NoiseEee> aberrant: $(#'commonParent').on('click','.classOfEverythingThatWillFire',function() {});
[10:47:55] <Wilornel> trying*
[10:48:06] <NoiseEee> aberrant: http://api.jquery.com/on/
[10:48:34] <shoky> Jon30 no
[10:48:45] <shoky> Jon30: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/FBqtF/
[10:49:05] <aberrant> NoiseEee: thanks. I'm a jquery / js noob, so this is gonna take a while.
[10:49:27] <Jon30> shoky: Oh i see what you did there. thank you, i will try that
[10:49:28] <aberrant> I've already got a common class assigned to both "#aN" and "#daN"
[10:50:02] <Jon30> shoky: it worked. thank you
[10:50:12] <shoky> np
[10:50:14] <Wilornel> Guys?
[10:50:24] <aberrant> NoiseEee: how do I specify that I want the specific text associated with the "header" toggled, and not everything?
[10:51:27] <Wilornel> Does anyone know how to send a file to the server without the need of switching pages using jquery?
[10:52:07] <johnkpaul> Wilornel: http://valums.com/ajax-upload/
[10:52:07] <NoiseEee> aberrant: if you're saying that #aX always shows #daX then you can do everything in one function.
[10:52:10] <johnkpaul> I've used that successfully
[10:52:23] <aberrant> NoiseEee: yup, that's exactly what I'm saying.
[10:52:29] <johnkpaul> Wilornel: that is a jquery plugin for ajax file uploads
[10:52:34] <systemfault> Wilornel: You use an hackâ€¦ There's a plugin called "jquery iframe transport"
[10:52:35] <Wilornel> Oh thanks
[10:52:37] <aberrant> NoiseEee: I just don't know how to write it :)
[10:54:19] <saulotoledo> Hello all! I want scrool my page with jQuery. I have the scrollTo plugin, but I want the browser scroll working smoothly.
[10:54:53] <NoiseEee> aberrant: $('#commonParent').on('click','.commonClassOnA',function() { var el = $(this);  elNum = el.substr(-1);  $('#da'+elNum).toggle() }   something like that
[10:55:19] <NoiseEee> aberrant: $('#commonParent').on('click','.commonClassOnA',function() { var el = $(this);  elNum = el.attr('id').substr(-1);  $('#da'+elNum).toggle() }   something like that
[10:55:22] <aberrant> NoiseEee: what's #commonParent?
[10:55:28] <saulotoledo> If I remove the browser scrool, the scrool event stop working, if I let the browser scroll, it disturbs the plugin work
[10:55:56] <NoiseEee> aberrant: a DOM element that is a parent to all your #aX elements
[10:56:03] <aberrant> ah, ok
[10:56:04] <aberrant> one sec.
[10:56:09] <aberrant> lemme give that a try. thank you.
[10:59:22] <aberrant> NoiseEee: that works perfectly. thank you!!!
[10:59:26] <aberrant> I changed it a little bit
[10:59:55] <aberrant> I didn't do the substr since the header is "#aN" and the description is "#daN" so I didn't extract the index; I just appended the header name to "#d"
[11:00:50] <NoiseEee> aberrant: great
[11:00:54] <aberrant> w00t. Thank you!.
[11:01:05] <NoiseEee> aberrant: no problem, do you understand what the code is doing?
[11:01:13] <NoiseEee> tahts more important, if you know what i mean
[11:01:18] <aberrant> $('#servicelist').on('click','.servicename',function() { var el = $(this);  elNum = el.attr('id');  $('#d'+elNum).fadeToggle("fast","swing");})
[11:01:20] <aberrant> yes
[11:01:33] <NoiseEee> great good luck
[11:01:35] <aberrant> I didn't know how to reference an id name within a function - that's why I was getting messed up
[11:01:46] <aberrant> I didn't know the .attr()
[11:03:26] <aberrant> This document was successfully checked as XHTML 1.0 Transitional!
[11:03:33] <aberrant> and the html validates :)
[11:03:37] <NoiseEee> congrats, bring on 2008
[11:03:42] <aberrant> hahahaha
[11:03:45] <NoiseEee> j/k not really
[11:03:52] <NoiseEee> you should be using html5
[11:03:59] <aberrant> guaranteed to be as cross-browser compatible as possible w/o using shims
[11:04:35] <aberrant> I should be using html5 but I dunno what happens when non-html5 browsers see it. I tried it earlier and got weird rendering.
[11:04:44] <NoiseEee> aberrant: nah. you going to wait until 2020 when maybe all the browsers will have their stuff together?  really there's no reason to not be marking up to html5 right now
[11:04:53] <NoiseEee> aberrant: nah, something else happened.
[11:05:03] <aberrant> I'll stick with
[11:05:08] <gehsekky> :(
[11:05:11] <aberrant> Root Namespace:	http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml
[11:05:12] <gehsekky> html5 ftw
[11:05:14] <antris> hey all. I'm doing functionality where i have a list of deferred objects. when all of the deferreds are done, I want to have a callback fired, and then one callback called for each deferred in the list, in the order they are in the list (not in the order of resolution). I can do the former, but how do I do the latter?
[11:05:16] <aberrant> party like it's 1999.
[11:05:52] <NoiseEee> aberrant: really, you would be making a mistake, but do as you want
[11:06:20] <aberrant> NoiseEee: it wouldn't be as simple as just changing the doctype, would it?
[11:06:32] <NoiseEee> aberrant: http://diveintohtml5.info/introduction.html
[11:06:49] <NoiseEee> aberrant: for the most part, yes.  and you can quit worrying about silly closing tags / self-closing tags etc
[11:07:03] <aberrant> NoiseEee: no <br /> ?
[11:07:10] <NoiseEee> no, but including that won't be an error.
[11:07:14] <aberrant> ok
[11:07:17] <aberrant> 'cause it's force of habit
[11:07:35] <NoiseEee> i hear you, but you should stay current / ie: not get into habits that will become irrelevant :)
[11:08:30] <aberrant> yeah
[11:08:37] <aberrant> getting some html5 errors, so will slog through it later
[11:08:42] <aberrant> need to get content out
[11:09:13] <aberrant> Line 10, Column 62: Bad value Copyright for attribute name on element meta: Keyword copyright is not registered.
[11:10:11] <NoiseEee> you're using copyright as an attribute name somewhere?
[11:10:44] <aberrant> meta name="copyright"
[11:11:08] <aberrant> guess that's no longer allowed.
[11:11:36] <aberrant> 'sok, I'll get around to it :)
[11:11:38] <aberrant> I promise.
[11:11:57] <min|dvir|us-work> Hi. How do I get the new value from within a keydown event?
[11:12:14] <z0ned> what's the proper way to programmatically check/uncheck a radio button? (latest jquery version)
[11:12:25] <min|dvir|us-work> z0ned, .prop('checked', true/false);
[11:12:44] <z0ned> why does [0].checked = true/false work?
[11:12:47] <z0ned> doesn't*
[11:13:01] <min|dvir|us-work> z0ned, ask ##javascript
[11:18:51] <StevenCodes> wow node is awesome
[11:22:00] <itatitat> hi guys
[11:22:05] <itatitat> I've a serious question
[11:22:18] <itatitat> I've a web with very much ajax
[11:22:45] <itatitat> Im creating much content by using ajax, since a controller
[11:22:54] <itatitat> but I dont like how the code is leaving
[11:23:05] <itatitat> because in my controller im mixing content and logic
[11:23:10] <itatitat> and I dont like that
[11:23:33] <min|dvir|us-work> Hi. How do I get the new value from within a keydown event?
[11:23:40] <itatitat> my question is.............is possible to make something?, I dont want to have so content in my controller
[11:28:23] <Jon47> itatitat: is this a jquery question?
[11:29:09] <horken> Hi. I'm not sure what the word is that I'm looking for, so maybe you can help. When I click a button on my page, I want a popup to appear on the page that allows me to scroll through, enter values into text boxes, and hit a submit button. It's almost like I want a popup to appear that's within the page. Is there a name for what I'm trying to create?
[11:29:32] <Jon47> horken: i think that's called a popover
[11:29:39] <horken> Jon47 ok thanks
[11:30:01] <itatitat> mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm, no......im seeing alternatives ideas...
[11:30:23] <Jon47> at least that's what they call it in bootstrap, makes sense to me
[11:31:26] <min|dvir|us-work> How do I get the new value from within a keydown event?
[11:31:51] <Jon47> min|dvir|us-work: did you try doing a web search, that's a pretty basic query
[11:32:09] <min|dvir|us-work> Jon47, wow, that's a great idea!
[11:32:33] <min|dvir|us-work> Anyone know?
[11:33:29] <Jon47> you're not going to get much help here if you're not willing to try to figure it out for yourself first
[11:33:43] <min|dvir|us-work> Jon47, I was being sarcastic. Of course I've searched.
[11:33:54] <min|dvir|us-work> Jon47, you probably don't understand my question.
[11:34:13] <min|dvir|us-work> From within a keydown handler, the value BEFORE the key is pressed is within event.target.value.
[11:34:18] <min|dvir|us-work> I want the value AFTER the key is pressed.
[11:34:31] <Jon47> min|dvir|us-work: there is a keyup event also
[11:34:44] <min|dvir|us-work> Jon47, but that's not what I want.
[11:34:45] <Jon47> and a keypress event
[11:34:49] <min|dvir|us-work> Also not what I want.
[11:35:19] <Jon47> the value o the entire input?
[11:35:46] <min|dvir|us-work> Jon47, pardon?
[11:37:55] <rhino> I have a line of code like this:  <div style = \"width:85px;float:left;\"><input onclick = \"hello = $(this.id);alert(hello);\"\"type=\"button\" value=\"Del\" style = \"height:20px;width:25px;float:right;background: pink;\"/></div><br /><br />";  why does it alert [object][object]?
[11:38:09] <Jon47> the keydown event fires, then the character does its default stuff, for example if you're in an input field it would get entered into the field, then keyup event fires
[11:38:18] <rhino> there is an echo in front of that btw
[11:38:48] <Jon47> if you want to get the value of the input  *with* the key you just pressed, i would bind on "keyup"
[11:39:16] <rhino> Jon47, any ideas?
[11:39:22] <Jon47> if you need to bind on keydown, the value of the input will not be set yet, but you can find out which character was typed by using jquerys event.which
[11:40:40] <Jon47> rhino i don't know where to start, you're finding the "id" of an element (the input) that does not have an id set
[11:41:10] <Jon47> plus why are you doing inline javascript in onclick attribs..
[11:41:32] <Jon47> and furthermore trying to alert an object isn't going to give you much meaningful info.
[11:43:26] <Tasser> what would be a way to get the original size of an image?
[11:59:22] <muka> Tasser: $('<img src="path/image.jpg">').width() should work
[12:00:09] <JoseBravo> Hello

[12:21:31] <aro> has anyone used Jcrop? im having problems getting thumbnail to scale properly for non 1:1 aspect ratios
[12:21:35] <xwurf_> how should jquery-selektor looks like?
[12:22:05] <xwurf_> important: the divs are nested and so one... i mean really ALL
[12:22:42] <xwurf_> i know, normally there should no div twice with same id, part thats part of the game ;)
[12:26:06] <shoky> xwurf_: $('div#hello').length
[12:28:48] <NoiseEee> xwurf_: normally = all the time.
[12:29:06] <NoiseEee> xwurf_: you're working with invalid markup.  fix it, or JS stuff is not going to work as expected.
[12:29:29] <xwurf_> @shoky: ty, you are a god
[12:29:56] <Brunoz> wsup my people
[12:32:13] <xwurf_> @NoiseEee: Yes, but prob is i work with a framework,... so i figure out all the time what to do :/
[12:32:34] <Whirl3d> when the docs say that a Deferred "attaches methods to the target", how does it do that? If my target is an element and I want to be able to maintain my chain, I need to add the ".done" method to that element. How?
[12:36:29] <Whirl3d> okay, nvm. I will just make my own method chain/callback queue object
[12:38:54] <kolix> his guys quick question
[12:39:12] <kolix> i have - $("input").mouseout(update_test_recalc_ajax); for an event for inputs
[12:39:22] <kolix> however, i just want the event listener for the input text
[12:39:25] <kolix> how can i do this?
[12:39:34] <raj> huh?
[12:39:41] <raj> event listener for the input text?
[12:39:42] <Whirl3d> .mouseout?
[12:39:44] <raj> when the text changes?
[12:39:45] <kolix> yeah
[12:39:57] <kolix> input type="text"
[12:39:58] <raj> 'change'?
[12:40:06] <kolix> $("input").mouseout(update_test_recalc_ajax) is doing it for ALL inputs
[12:40:18] <kolix> i just want input text for the event listener
[12:40:24] <raj> you need to have an id or a class on the input box you want it for
[12:40:30] <Whirl3d> mouseout? I thought it was mouseleave
[12:40:32] <kolix> it's created dynamically
[12:40:39] <raj> then .bind() it
[12:40:42] <raj> when you create it
[12:41:08] <kolix> can't i do something like $("input:text").mouseout(update_test_recalc_ajax) to handle all input type text boxes on the page?
[12:41:16] <Whirl3d> This is a perfect time to use .on to delegate the responsiblity to the parent of the input element
[12:41:54] <Whirl3d> $(".form").on("mouseleave", "input:text", function (e) {
[12:42:28] <Whirl3d> though I am not sure if mouseleave bubbles...
[12:43:46] <Whirl3d> kolix, do you mean to recalculate on mouse leave or on blur
[12:43:54] <xwurf_> @shoky: now i have  $('div#hello') as you proposed. is there a way to get the LAST div of this objects?
[12:44:15] <xwurf_> and to delete the others
[12:44:20] <doc|work> anyone used the jquery validation plugin with ckeditor? I want to figure out how to get it to show an error message onsubmit. Doesn't seem to want to wkr
[12:44:26] <doc|work> *work
[12:44:41] <doc|work> other inputs work fine, is just the ckeditor instances that don't
[12:44:49] <kolix> yes
[12:44:59] <kolix> you guys are making it too complex
[12:45:19] <Whirl3d> ?
[12:45:24] <gilesb> I'm doing some SharePoint UI customization and need to keep track of etags, which are returned in the xhr response headers: problem is getAllResponseHeaders is returning null in IE (but not in FF or Chrome...)
[12:45:26] <kolix> $("input").mouseout(update_test_recalc_ajax); called that function anytime a user mouseout an html input element
[12:45:31] <kolix> and it worked
[12:45:40] <kolix> however, ijsut want it to work for input type="text"
[12:45:55] <kolix> can i do that with the abov eline of code?
[12:45:55] <gilesb> anyone experienced this issue with xhr?
[12:45:56] <Whirl3d> "input:text"
[12:46:44] <Whirl3d> and good luck with that. Whenever I focus on an input element, I "mouseout" of it
[12:48:07] <Whirl3d> kolix and with text input fields, what if the user tabs into it? the"mouseout" event will never fire
[12:49:33] <p3lim> Hey, I need help with something basic. I need to get the two strings in the following snipped down in two variables: http://pastebin.com/Cm4QYp0d
[12:51:04] <p3lim> I already use $('.info', $(this)) to get the div container
[12:51:20] <snover> well thatâ€™s not right.
[12:52:03] <snover> (correct: $(this).find('.info'))
[12:52:35] <Whirl3d> var texts=$(".info b").map(function (elem) {return $(this).text();}).get(); var texta=texts[0]; var textb=texts[1]; but that may be more than what you need. Maybe you just want $(".info b").first().text();  and $(".info b").last().text();
[12:54:37] <p3lim> Whirl3d: I'm guessing the first one is to iterate over all <b>'s
[12:54:45] <p3lim> But thanks for the help, it worked :)
[12:55:11] <Whirl3d> Yep. It'll get all the texts in an array. Then to access them, use a numeric index on the array
[12:55:27] <p3lim> Yeah, might come in handy later :)
[12:55:51] <skcin7> Does anybody know if web design work you do for a client is considered a taxable item in the United States or elsewhere?
[12:56:14] <Whirl3d> you should probably return elem.text()  rather than $(this).text()... it'll save time/cpu
[12:56:21] <NoiseEee> skcin7: report. all.  income.
[12:56:34] <NoiseEee> #lawyerin
[12:56:47] <p3lim> Whirl3d: I'm guessing this would work too?: $('.info b').last().text().replace(' - ', '');
[12:57:02] <p3lim> I want to remove the ' - ' part of the 2nd string
[12:57:11] <Whirl3d> skcin7, it's complicated
[12:57:17] <Whirl3d> p3lim, yes
[12:57:20] <shoky> xwurf_: $('div#hello').last()
[12:58:16] <p3lim> Whirl3d: Didn't work out properly, instead of placing nothing, the word 'undefined' was added
[12:59:11] <Whirl3d> this is a great time to use jsfiddle. If your are not familiar with it, check ti out: jsfiddle.net
[12:59:28] <p3lim> Ah nvm, I did a little mistake :)

[13:52:22] <catcher> How to begin debugging a jquery issue that immediately and irrecoverably hangs firefox (and no other browsers), before it gets a chance to complain to the firebug console (or server logs)?
[13:52:48] <krz> I've got 3 li elements. each li element has a span element with a number. how do i order the li elements based on the number?
[13:52:48] <catcher> break points near the suspected culprit?
[13:53:03] <krz> the number in the span. i.e. <span>1234</span>
[13:54:10] <catcher> krz, I'd give them IDs, grab them, sort them, then replace the original list with the new one.
[13:54:45] <catcher> krz, or give them data attributes
[13:54:46] <krz> hm
[13:56:04] <krz> artist and song equal 0
[13:56:17] <krz> shouldn't this condition go through: if ((!artist) && (!song)) {
[13:58:50] <catcher> krz, does it work properly if you test for 0 comparison instead?
[13:59:24] <krz> == 0?
[13:59:37] <catcher> krz, right. I'm pretty sure ! in js boolean..
[13:59:45] <catcher> krz, meaning if artist and song have a value, they're true.
[14:00:10] <ngharo> ?js 0 == true

[14:04:29] <johnkpaul> MistuhKurtz: it doesn't seem like pinterest has a jsonp api
[14:04:56] <RA3OR> hi all.... http://pastesite.com/34751
[14:04:56] <johnkpaul> MistuhKurtz: that's why ther eis a parse error
[14:04:57] <Chofoteddy> disculpen... cómo puedo expulsar una variable, es decir: var x=''; $.getJSON('url', function(data){ x=data; }); ?
[14:05:07] <dwarder> is it possible to show (i.e. output to console in some way) a jquery object?
[14:05:15] <MistuhKurtz> johnkpaul, the API is supposedly working for read-only access
[14:05:16] <MistuhKurtz> http://tijn.bo.lt/pinterest-api
[14:05:34] <catcher> dwarder, sure, console.log(object)
[14:05:39] <johnkpaul> it does, MistuhKurtz
[14:05:42] <johnkpaul> but not a jsonp api
[14:05:49] <MistuhKurtz> what kind then?
[14:05:52] <johnkpaul> json or xml
[14:05:58] <MistuhKurtz> it says JSON
[14:06:02] <johnkpaul> yes
[14:06:06] <johnkpaul> json != jsonp
[14:06:29] <dwarder> catcher: thank you
[14:06:29] <MistuhKurtz> when I use dataType: "jsonp" it returns the data
[14:06:37] <MistuhKurtz> when i use dataType: "json" it just has an error
[14:06:46] <MistuhKurtz> but with "jsonp" it says parse error
[14:06:55] <johnkpaul> :) so in both cases there is an error
[14:07:05] <johnkpaul> if you use json, the error is because you're trying to make a cross domain ajx request
[14:07:07] <johnkpaul> ?sop
[14:07:08] <bot-t> Same origin policy prevents a document or script loaded from one origin from getting or setting properties of a document from another origin. Two pages are considered to have the same origin if the protocol, port, and host are the same for both pages. https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Same_origin_policy_for_JavaScript
[14:07:20] <johnkpaul> when you use "jsonp" the issue is that they don't support jsonp
[14:07:27] <johnkpaul> you'll need to look into making a server side proxy
[14:07:32] <johnkpaul> that requests the json, and converts it into jsonp
[14:08:04] <MistuhKurtz> hum
[14:08:14] <MistuhKurtz> SOP, even though it's just a GET request?
[14:08:31] <johnkpaul> yes, GET falls under all of the same rules
[14:08:50] <johnkpaul> "prevents a document or script...from _getting_"..."
[14:08:57] <MistuhKurtz> i see
[14:09:44] <johnkpaul> I am looking for a guide to create a simple php jsonp proxy, but I my googlefu is failing me
[14:10:00] <johnkpaul> it's not a difficult think to creat MistuhKurtz, it's just not as easy as jsonp on it's own
[14:10:02] <johnkpaul> thing to create*
[14:10:19] <MistuhKurtz> yeah
[14:10:31] <MistuhKurtz> on the command line using CURL I get the response
[14:10:49] <MistuhKurtz> Would I be able to use AJAX to request and parse an RSS feed?
[14:10:54] <johnkpaul> ah MistuhKurtz this is what I'm looking for
[14:10:54] <johnkpaul> http://remysharp.com/2007/10/08/what-is-jsonp/
[14:10:57] <systemfault> If you create a proxy.. it would be stupid to convert the json to jsonp
[14:11:06] <systemfault> Sinceâ€¦ the proxy itself is on your own server.
[14:11:28] <johnkpaul> systemfault: true, unless you want to open it up to others
[14:12:34] <johnkpaul> also, you could want to use it from multiple domains, systemfault
[14:12:35] <bung> is there a better "javascript" way to get the href while going through anchors using an .each() ... like some $('a').each(function(e){ var href = e.target.href; ... } or is it only $this.attr('href') ?
[14:13:14] <bung> wait a minute, let me try this.target.href lol
[14:13:16] <bung> i wonder..
[14:13:22] <johnkpaul> bung: this.href should work fine in that code
[14:13:27] <johnkpaul> or this.getAttribute("href")
[14:13:41] <MistuhKurtz> soo
[14:13:51] <MistuhKurtz> JSONP is JSON that is meant to be accessed from separate domains?
[14:14:10] <bung> johnkpaul: yea brain fart about "this" thanks, woohoo friday
[14:14:17] <johnkpaul> MistuhKurtz: yes
[14:14:27] <johnkpaul> bung: :) no problem
[14:14:41] <MistuhKurtz> okay, well it's returning the data. it just says parse error: invalid label
[14:14:57] <johnkpaul> MistuhKurtz: that's because without the server expecting JSONP, it's spitting out a json object
[14:15:02] <systemfault> jsonp is an ugly hack.
[14:15:07] <johnkpaul> a json object where it is expecting a function call
[14:15:16] <johnkpaul> yes, it's an ugly hack that makes some expectations of the script tag
[14:15:29] <johnkpaul> ?eval {"hello":"world"
[14:15:30] <catcher> so can he request a jsonp object and parse as json?
[14:15:30] <bot-t> johnkpaul: SyntaxError: invalid label
[14:15:33] <johnkpaul> ?eval {"hello":"world"}
[14:15:33] <bot-t> johnkpaul: SyntaxError: invalid label
[14:15:38] <johnkpaul> see, MistuhKurtz, same error
[14:15:40] <johnkpaul> invalid  label
[14:15:48] <johnkpaul> because a json serialized string is invalid javascript on it's own
[14:15:51] <johnkpaul> its own*
[14:16:00] <MistuhKurtz> i see.
[14:16:21] <johnkpaul> ?eval print({"hello":"world"});
[14:16:22] <bot-t> johnkpaul: {"hello": "world"}
[14:16:22] <MistuhKurtz> JSONP executes the javascript, rather than just returning the object?
[14:16:24] <johnkpaul> no error
[14:16:32] <johnkpaul> that's the ugly hack of jsonp, MistuhKurtz
[14:16:38] <johnkpaul> all jsonp is, is executing the script
[14:16:41] <MistuhKurtz> yeah.
[14:16:44] <johnkpaul> did you read that article from remysharp?
[14:16:57] <bung> sweet, this.hash, thats awesome, i dont have to strip anything
[14:17:36] <MistuhKurtz> yes
[14:18:56] <MistuhKurtz> Well, is there any way that I can just retrieve this data?
[14:19:42] <MistuhKurtz> or can I try with an RSS feed instead?
[14:19:44] <johnkpaul> MistuhKurtz: yes, using a server side proxy, using the techniques described in that blog post
[14:19:52] <johnkpaul> if the rss feed is on another domain, you'll have the same issue
[14:22:52] <MistuhKurtz> http://bob.pythonmac.org/archives/2005/12/05/remote-json-jsonp/

[14:55:39] <MistuhKurtz> lol johnkpaul
[14:55:48] <johnkpaul> :) at least someone has done the work for you
[14:55:54] <johnkpaul> I wouldn't really rely on that for production purposes
[14:56:00] <MistuhKurtz> aw damn it's ruby
[14:56:18] <MistuhKurtz> Yeah I was gonna grab the code for my server :P but i need PHP
[14:57:01] <johnkpaul> MistuhKurtz: if you're using php, that article I sent earlier you can pretty much just copy and paste from
[14:57:05] <johnkpaul> not that I would advocate that
[14:57:18] <johnkpaul> ?inArray @B_
[14:57:19] <bot-t> B_, jQuery.inArray(value, array): Search for a specified value within an array and return its index (or -1 if not found). http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.inArray/
[14:57:29] <johnkpaul> that would help, but there's no jQuery.intersection or something
[14:58:47] <MistuhKurtz> I don't quite understand the PHP portion johnkpaul
[14:58:55] <B_> @johnkpaul would you recommend iterating over the first array and checking if each value is inArray of the second?
[14:59:14] <johnkpaul> ?g set intersection algorithm javascript @ B_

[14:59:32] <johnkpaul> MistuhKurtz: that's where you'd need to ask ##php
[14:59:40] <MistuhKurtz> ay
[14:59:47] <B_> gracias
[15:00:14] <johnkpaul> B_: no problem, have fun
[15:02:01] <spoonybard> how can i tell jquery that this is one class? class = "matrix_cal_body matrix_cal_body_arr matrix_cal_body_dotted"
[15:02:34] <Tasser> why does the image come from the bottom right? I created the starting image as big as the source. http://jsfiddle.net/zWW29/
[15:04:16] <Tasser> http://jsfiddle.net/zWW29/1/ little update (another thing was buggy)
[15:05:30] <johnkpaul> spoonybard: what do you mean "that this is one class"? that is not one class, it is 3
[15:06:22] <spoonybard> johnkpaul, jquery seems to be treating the selector as a "within" selector
[15:07:16] <ajpiano> spoonybard: $(".foo.bar.baz")
[15:07:24] <ajpiano> instead of $(".foo .bar .baz")
[15:07:51] <Whirl3d> Afternoon all. I have been looking at numerous sort implementations in the procvess of developing my own sort plugin and I guess I don't understand how you can expect to sort elements that aren't sbilings() with the same parent I mean, it doesn't make sense to sort items with different parents because how would you move them in the dom without messing things up?
[15:07:53] <johnkpaul> :) ajpiano, your inferences are wise
[15:08:03] <ajpiano> heheh
[15:08:35] <MistuhKurtz> huray
[15:09:58] <MistuhKurtz> thank you for your help johnkpaul: http://jsfiddle.net/kvcrawford/a55Jp/3/
[15:10:20] <MistuhKurtz> now, if I can figure out how to access pins from a specified user account or board
[15:10:29] <johnkpaul> :), awesome job MistuhKurtz, you're welcome
[15:14:53] <Shown> i've a little problem. i need to use jquery on a website of mine which is using a template made with mootols. well ok, i call jQuery.noConflict() just after having loaded the jquery.js. it works fine and from now on i can use jQuery id. i am using also a plugin for jQuery, and it seems to create some sort of conflict with mootools. checked in js of plugin and find some $., how can i solve this kind of errors?
[15:18:36] <johnkpaul> Shown: wrap the plugin with (function($){})(jQuery)
[15:19:35] <sphinxxx> i just uploaded my site , and locally everything works great, but online, i have an ajax POST , that simply returns a 500 error
[15:19:58] <sphinxxx> i don't understand, because if I browse directly to the POST's request url, it works fine
[15:25:06] <Tasser> can I ask wherever the mouse is over an element?
[15:32:33] <Tasser> how do I get the full size of the page?
[15:35:02] <Dr-Bombay> $(document).width() and .height()
[15:36:12] <Tasser> thanks
[15:41:18] <Emn1ty> anyone know why VideoJS would fail to play an ogg in firefox? I've loaded the video itself fine and my .htaccess file has the proper lines to support the format but whenever VideoJS tries to play it I get an error.
[15:42:38] <Emn1ty> Video Error Object { originalEvent=Event error, type="error", timeStamp=1334961725551, more...}
[15:42:39] <Emn1ty> video.js (line 21)
[15:43:46] <spoonybard> is there a firebug addon that can generate css or jquery selectors based on your highlighted text?
[15:43:53] <jwg2s> anyone know of a way to get the value of a css selector attribute and store it?
[15:45:30] <Shown> johnkpaul i will try
[15:45:49] <spoonybard> jwg2s, $('a').attr('href'); like this?
[15:45:58] <jwg2s> i want to get the current opacity of a div and store to reuse later
[15:46:12] <jwg2s> no a css selector
[15:46:27] <Whirl3d> $("div").css(selectorname);
[15:46:39] <Whirl3d> $("div").css("opacity")
[15:46:42] <jwg2s> ah ok
[15:47:28] <Whirl3d> *not selectorname so much as css attribute name
[15:47:48] <Whirl3d> or possibly even css property name.
[15:49:48] <jwg2s> property name ya
[15:50:21] <jwg2s> i can't seem to get the variable to store, isn't it just $variablename = $('#div').css('opacity');
[15:51:52] <Emn1ty> anyone have experience with VideoJS?
[15:52:17] <jwg2s> anyone?
[15:52:18] <jwg2s> spoonybard:
[15:52:19] <Whirl3d> there is some discussion about the use of $before variable names in order to identify jquery objects. but I don't think it's appropriate (despite which side of the argument you are in line with) to use $variable for scalar property value storage in jquery...just saying. But
[15:52:40] <jwg2s> Whirl3d: what would you suggest in my case
[15:52:46] <Whirl3d> var op=$("#div").css("opacity");
[15:53:14] <Whirl3d> but some folks like var $divlist=$("div");
[15:53:57] <Whirl3d> I find it too confusing to use the $ in front of variable names so avoid it. But you will see others using it.
[15:53:57] <jwg2s> got it
[15:53:59] <jwg2s> thanks
[15:54:20] <Whirl3d> np
[15:54:52] <billygalbreath> Whirl3d: in your above case, will changing op automagically change $('#div').css('opacity') as well? I think that's the original question.
[15:55:08] <Whirl3d> No
[15:55:32] <Whirl3d> To set css properties for an element, you pass two parameters to the$.css method
[15:55:47] <Whirl3d> $("div").css("propertyname",propertyvalue);
[15:55:54] <Whirl3d> sets the value
[15:56:20] <Whirl3d> whereas $("div").css("propertyname")  ---with no value defined, will return the current value
[15:57:00] <billygalbreath> indeed, but will op.css('name','value'); change the opacity of the original div?
[15:57:11] <Whirl3d> NO
[15:57:18] <billygalbreath> just checking
[15:57:45] <Whirl3d> op in the above case is a simple scalar value of the opacity. It doesn't have any methods or properties. it's just a number
[15:58:57] <Whirl3d> that would be like asking:   does .2.css("opacity",.4) change the opacity of some element? how would jquery know which element?
[15:59:09] <coachz> Hi guys, I'm trying to use this gallery plugin but can't figure out how to tell it where my images live.  http://blueimp.github.com/Bootstrap-Image-Gallery/    my site:  http://www.atouchofclassband.com/gallery.php   any ideas please how to point it to look in my /gallery dir ?
[16:00:34] <scram> Can I get some input on what javascript slider is best suited for a recipe website?  http://www.resumeicons.com/test1/index.php  -or-  http://www.resumeicons.com/html/homepage.html
[16:01:07] <Whirl3d> coachz, it appears that you have to include <a> elements with the path to your images in a div with id="gallery"
[16:01:43] <coachz> how is my site currently finding all those images it's displaying
[16:02:15] <coachz> this is all i have currently  http://pastebin.com/QYEe9eiV
[16:02:19] <coachz> and it shows all those images
[16:02:43] <coachz> so i assumed i could point to a dir instead of listing each file individually
[16:04:12] <dabear> coachz: look at the bootstrap-image-gallery
[16:04:17] <dabear> / Load images via flickr for demonstration purposes:
[16:04:22] <dabear> search for that
[16:05:05] <dabear> coachz: it seems like appending an anchor with an image inside into #gallery is enough
[16:05:06] <coachz> here?  https://github.com/blueimp/Bootstrap-Image-Gallery
[16:05:37] <Whirl3d> and coachz, when you are still working on your site and you haven't got it perfected, use the non-minimized versions of the code you are implementing. Otherwise it makes in really difficult to help
[16:05:56] <coachz> right
[16:07:16] <coachz> ok i got rid of the mins
[16:08:40] <dabear> coachz: look at the source of blueimp.github.com/Bootstrap-Image-Gallery/
[16:08:46] <coachz> so you think i need to manually add each image in an <a> ?
[16:08:57] <dabear> line 172 clearly states how to do this
[16:09:12] <Whirl3d> Now if the plugin doesn't have a builtin system for traversing a provided path to grab images, you could write a small php script to open a directory and return the images in it. Then you can form the reply into <a> elements to append to your gallery div
[16:09:42] <coachz> my line 172 appears to have:   url = 'http://farm' + photo.farm + '.static.flickr.com/' +
[16:09:42] <coachz>                 photo.server + '/' + photo.id + '_' + photo.secret;
[16:09:54] <dabear> coachz: yyes it does
[16:10:05] <dabear> and there is also an appendTo
[16:10:33] <coachz> i'm unsure what to change to my code to make it find the dir
[16:10:46] <jaha> has anyone used Noty with Twitter Bootstrap?
[16:11:14] <coachz> all my code has currently is this:  http://pastebin.com/5wg4KJPH
[16:11:17] <coachz> yet it also finds all those images
[16:11:21] <Whirl3d> scram, I like the first one.  (test1)
[16:12:07] <Whirl3d> coachz are those your images?
[16:12:07] <dabear> coachz: serverside, generate this for each image in the div: <a rel="gallery" href="fooo" title="bar"><img src="foo.jpg"></div>
[16:12:16] <coachz> no
[16:12:25] <dabear> coachz: and add that to your #gallery
[16:12:26] <coachz> those images are autoloading from the site
[16:12:37] <Whirl3d> which site?
[16:12:46] <coachz> from their site
[16:12:56] <coachz> i'll try adding a <a> like you show
[16:13:03] <dabear> then call the plugin
[16:13:06] <Whirl3d> Oh, "their" site. Much clearer
[16:13:27] <coachz> so i add the <a> stuff inside  <div id="gallery"></div>  yes ?
[16:14:16] <dabear> coachz: the lines 172-178 tells you how to do this for one image
[16:14:37] <Shown> johnkpaul: Shown: wrap the plugin with (function($){})(jQuery)
[16:14:38] <Shown> it's already wrapped at top level
[16:15:17] <Dr-Bombay> is there a way to discard the history of a query object that is restored by end()
[16:15:45] <dabear> coachz: basically, you just create the links you need with images inside. then you start the plugin from their parent element
[16:16:07] <coachz> dabear, i'm confused.  My first questions is why is my site loading all those images from their site
[16:16:10] <dabear> and it scans the children element to create the gallery
[16:16:33] <coachz> http://www.atouchofclassband.com/gallery.php
[16:16:51] <Shown> it's not so important... hope it will not mess with mootools
[16:16:55] <Shown> thanks anyway
[16:16:57] <Whirl3d> It's loading them from flickr as a placeholder
[16:17:04] <Whirl3d> so you can see how it's done
[16:17:08] <dabear> coachz: it is fetching those images through ajax
[16:17:09] <coachz> my source doesn't seem to call it  http://pastebin.com/xUPpCcFj
[16:17:14] <Shown> goodnight
[16:17:15] <Whirl3d> you replace the flickr code with your own
[16:17:28] <coachz> in what file ?  my gallery.php file doesn't have that code
[16:17:36] <coachz> which is this:  http://pastebin.com/xUPpCcFj
[16:18:29] <coachz> so i'm confused what reference on my site points to those flickr files
[16:18:45] <dabear> coachz: THIS FILE
[16:18:46] <dabear> http://www.atouchofclassband.com/js/blueimp/js/main.js
[16:18:49] <dabear> READ IT
[16:18:59] <coachz> ahhhhhhh,  thanks !!!!
[16:19:09] <Whirl3d> WOW. It saiys clearly: load images via flicker for demonstration purposes.
[16:19:32] <coachz> i didn't know to look in that file,  thank yo
[16:19:36] <coachz> you
[16:19:51] <dabear> man, I did only what I am expecting you to
[16:20:03] <dabear> read the contents of the files..
[16:20:16] <dabear> or set a breakpoint
[16:20:38] <dabear> for example
[16:20:45] <coachz> so there's not a simple url i can change to make it look in my /gallery dir and use those images ?
[16:20:49] <dabear> open the debugging console in chrome
[16:20:53] <dabear> go to elements tab
[16:21:25] <dabear> find gallery, right click the node and press "break on subtree modifications"
[16:21:29] <coachz> i got elements tab open
[16:21:40] <dabear> and step up the stack on the right side
[16:22:33] <dabear> coachz: go to https://developers.google.com/chrome-developer-tools/docs/scripts-breakpoints
[16:22:52] <coachz> you mean the id=gallery  div ?
[16:23:02] <dabear> sure
[16:23:38] <dabear> coachz: programatically create a list of all images you have, preferably serverside
[16:24:06] <coachz> can i just list them manually ?
[16:24:13] <dabear> and then just run through the code I was referring to on lines 172
[16:24:30] <dabear> e.g. create the same structure for each image, and append it to #gallery
[16:24:34] <coachz> can i list them manually in main.js somewhere ?
[16:24:40] <dabear> you can add them amnually
[16:24:54] <dabear> you can actually do this in the html file
[16:24:59] <coachz> so i don't need that ajax call ?
[16:25:04] <dabear> no need to do this from the js
[16:25:11] <dabear> if that is easier for you to understand
[16:25:18] <coachz> so i don't even need main.js ?
[16:25:30] <dabear> then just have PHP or your preferred language of choice create the html structure
[16:25:39] <dabear> I didn't say that
[16:25:59] <coachz> i'm trying to find the simplest way to get rid of the flickr images and put mine in there
[16:26:00] <dabear> the main.js file contains more functionality than just the image retrieval from flickr
[16:26:18] <billygalbreath> ok, Whirl3d. i think i'm awake now. sorry for the dumb questions earlier. i misinterpreted that dude's question and though you answered it wrong. I really should get on a normal sleeping schedule lol
[16:26:20] <coachz> listing them manually is fine
[16:26:46] <coachz> i'm just not sure how to do this
[16:26:54] <dabear> Didn't I just tell you the easiest way? DO I have to give you detailed instructions? isn't this something you as a developer should do your self?
[16:27:15] <coachz> i just told you i don't see how
[16:27:20] <coachz> was i not clear ?
[16:27:26] <billygalbreath> coachz: can you read code?
[16:27:39] <coachz> hi billygalbreath some code
[16:27:52] <dabear> coachz: if you're not here to learn, then don't wase our time
[16:28:07] <dabear> REMOVE line starting with // Load images via flickr for demonstration purposes:
[16:28:18] <dabear> and the things below
[16:28:29] <IconicSchema> Read through everything below that and you should see how to structure the html for each image
[16:28:31] <dabear> and then create the html structure
[16:28:40] <coachz> so the entire ajax function right dabear ?
[16:28:59] <coachz> and the .done callback
[16:29:10] <dabear> if you don't wanna load your files through ajax, then yes, you remove that ajax function
[16:29:20] <coachz> done
[16:29:33] <IconicSchema> did you read it first..?
[16:31:01] <billygalbreath> as i read this conversation i can picture coachz under the hood of a car and not understanding whats going on. So, he just starts pulling out parts that sound useless to him and hoping it works still.
[16:31:03] <coachz> cool, that stopped the filckr images, now if i can load my images I'll be golden
[16:31:22] <coachz> billygalbreath, thanks for your help
[16:31:53] <dabear> coachz: https://skitch.com/bjorninge/8w3cw/bootstrap-image-gallery
[16:32:01] <dabear> just create that structure your self
[16:32:07] <dabear> using whatever way you like
[16:32:22] <coachz> thanks, you are very kind dabear !
[16:32:27] <coachz> i'll give it a shot now
[16:32:32] <dabear> and you are being a jerk
[16:32:45] <coachz> i don't think so
[16:32:50] <dabear> you blatantly come here, expecting us to do the job for you
[16:32:54] <coachz> i'm simply asking for help and i have limited knowledge
[16:33:02] <dabear> how did you even star debugging?
[16:33:19] <coachz> i'm not forcing anyone to help me if they don't want to
[16:33:24] <IconicSchema> coachz: the best thing you can do is learn to read through the code and understand what its doing before asking any questions
[16:34:00] <dabear> coachz: this quote I think is quite accurate
[16:34:02] <dabear> <billygalbreath> as i read this conversation i can picture coachz under the hood of a car and not understanding whats going on. So, he just starts pulling out parts that sound useless to him and hoping it works still.
[16:34:04] <IconicSchema> you copied a script to your site and ask how to change it without looking at what you copied
[16:34:29] <coachz> i didn't realize that main.js was where the action was happening
[16:35:53] <billygalbreath>  i didn't realize that main.js was where the action was happening --> translated --> I didnt realize the pistons were what made the engine run.
[16:36:58] <coachz> you seem to like car analogies,  i have probably built more car engines than you have seen
[16:37:10] <billygalbreath> most likely
[16:37:13] <billygalbreath> i'm not a mechanic
[16:37:35] <coachz> so i added 3 image refs but it doesn't thumbnail them  http://www.atouchofclassband.com/gallery.php
[16:38:39] <billygalbreath> coachz: why do you have the images in the head?
[16:38:54] <Whirl3d> so, coachz, if you have worked on cars in the past, would you just go buy an alternator, open the hood place it under the hood, close the hood and expect it to work?
[16:39:15] <coachz> can we stop with car analogies please
[16:39:23] <billygalbreath> analogies are awesome
[16:39:38] <coachz> the gallery images are not in the head they are in the gallery div
[16:40:13] <billygalbreath> you have a div in the head, which is holding an unsorted list with images in it
[16:40:55] <coachz> billygalbreath now it don't, same problem  http://www.atouchofclassband.com/gallery.php
[16:41:36] <billygalbreath> i'd like to take this moment to call you an idiot in the nicest way possible. and on that note, i'm done.
[16:41:54] <coachz> billygalbreath thanks for your amazing insights
[16:42:06] <IconicSchema> coachz: you should really create thumbnails for each of the images
[16:42:12] <IconicSchema> the img tag should point the thumbnail
[16:42:14] <coachz> i'm guessing the .append($('<img>').prop('src', url + '_s.jpg'))  is needed in that ajax call ?
[16:42:21] <IconicSchema> otherwise your website will load forever
[16:42:26] <dabear> coachz: https://skitch.com/bjorninge/8w3p2/www.atouchofclassband.com-gallery.php
[16:42:31] <coachz> oh you are right, i needed to point to the thumbnails i made
[16:42:32] <dabear> did you see those errors?
[16:43:03] <coachz> sec dabear, you are right
[16:43:43] <Dr-Bombay> place your bets, by what date will someone have created a web browser that runs in a canvas
[16:44:30] <dabear> Dr-Bombay: someone has probably done that already
[16:44:43] <billygalbreath> btw, Whirl3d. i ran the numbers script on a slow computer today at school and it was flawless, even with the interval set at 50 :D
[16:44:45] <Dr-Bombay> no not quite yet. I checked
[16:45:19] <nbari> hi all, I have a form (shopingcart) that when the user clicks on the checkout button, and order ID is created the one I need to use and submit via post to paypal, but I am stock there.
[16:45:28] <Dr-Bombay> but it is inevitable
[16:46:02] <nbari> any ideas of how after geting the order ID (this is odne via ajax) if success I can submit the data with other vars to paypal and so rediret the users page like the form action="" will do ?
[16:46:35] <dabear> Dr-Bombay: http://vimeo.com/21062117
[16:46:39] <dabear> something like that
[16:46:47] <dabear> dunno if they use canvas or not though
[16:48:30] <Dr-Bombay> it can't be canvas, it's too fast :)
[16:48:55] <dabear> there's also a pdf reader for canvas
[16:49:04] <Dr-Bombay> but I've seen projects that are developing common controls in canvas
[16:49:25] <Dr-Bombay> welcome to
[16:49:31] <Dr-Bombay> bah
[16:49:37] <coachz> dabear,  i think it's working now  http://www.atouchofclassband.com/gallery.php
[16:49:44] <Chofoteddy> Object.length ? :D
[16:50:02] <Dr-Bombay> welcome to MatryoskaOS
[16:50:22] <coachz> thank you very much dabear,  you are very patient and helpful and I learned a lot
[16:51:14] <dabear> coachz: http://getfirebug.com/doc/breakpoints/demo.html
[16:51:18] <dabear> learn about it
[16:51:23] <billygalbreath> dabear: the new gnome3 is JS and CSS based UI, so I'm sure that has something to do with the ability to run a program in a browser like that
[16:51:27] <dabear> works kinda the same way in chrome and firefox
[16:51:36] <Dr-Bombay> well shoot it is using canvas after all, thanks for the pointer dabear
[16:51:38] <coachz> i kept your chrome breakpoints link to go through
[16:52:03] <coachz> or rather Whirl3d's link   https://developers.google.com/chrome-developer-tools/docs/scripts-breakpoints
[16:53:57] <coachz> I created my header with this:  http://pastebin.com/wH2jya1N   Is it wrong to have that in my header or just wrong to load it in my <head></head>  with <?php include("inc/header.php"); ?>
[16:54:06] <vitsaus> nm
[16:54:26] <billygalbreath> coachz: all content goes in <body></body>
[16:54:40] <coachz> thanks i'll move the include
[16:56:28] <coachz> gettin a new scooter in the morning.....zoom zoom    Kymco like 200i
[16:56:52] <catcher> coachz, nice move, I've got a honda sh150i, love it
[16:57:10] <coachz> i really wanted the sh150i and my dealer said the stopped making them
[16:57:16] <coachz> for US
[16:57:28] <coachz> i like the bigger tires on yours
[16:57:29] <catcher> coachz, I got the last one in the store I went to..
[16:57:39] <catcher> yeah, the height makes a big diff
[16:57:43] <coachz> you must have a blast on that bike
[16:57:50] <coachz> does 65mph ?
[16:58:01] <catcher> coachz, sure does, though I stay off freeways.
[16:58:11] <catcher> 91mpg doesn't hurt either
[16:58:26] <coachz> yeah, this one does 80mpg and 65mph
[16:58:35] <coachz> i like that we both got fuel injection
[16:58:36] <catcher> that's great man, you'll enjoy it
[16:58:39] <catcher> yepyep
[16:59:01] <billygalbreath> i want a bike. but the one i want will kill me, i know it will
[16:59:02] <coachz> this is her:  http://charleston.craigslist.org/mcy/2963100433.html
[16:59:17] <coachz> i'm just gonna drive it around the empty neighborhood streets
[16:59:24] <coachz> billygalbreath be careful if you get one
[17:00:35] <coachz> these bikes are only fun if you live after riding them :-)
[17:00:46] <MistuhKurtz> johnkpaul-afk, check out my pinterest stream proof-of-concept: http://comps.gunnjerkens.com/pinterest/
[17:00:51] <MistuhKurtz> thanks for the help :D
[17:01:26] <billygalbreath> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kawasaki_Ninja_650R thats the one i want coachz
[17:01:43] <billygalbreath> but blue/black
[17:02:03] <coachz> that's a rocket ship man !!!
[17:02:15] <coachz> this guy at works drives a yamaha vmx scooter
[17:02:22] <coachz> it's a scooter and does 135mph !!!
[17:02:34] <billygalbreath> lol nice
[17:02:40] <coachz> hehehe
[17:02:50] <coachz> we had a guy at work die last week on a motorcycle
[17:02:57] <coachz> a truck pulled out in front of him
[17:03:05] <coachz> right at the gate where I go in to work
[17:03:12] <coachz> he was on a huge harley
[17:03:21] <coachz> and the truck just squished him like a bug
[17:03:30] <coachz> really sad day
[17:03:45] <billygalbreath> thats why i _want_ a bike, but dont have one. maybe when I'm over 50 and stop caring for life lol
[17:04:02] <coachz> jet skis are fun and much safer :-)
[17:04:05] <coachz> i do those a lot
[17:06:58] <coachz> my old coworker had a bike like that about 3 years ago, loaned it to his roommate who ran it into a bridge and died, lots of power
[17:07:05] <coachz> he missed the on ramp
[17:07:42] <catcher> coachz, they don't do well on land I've heard.
[17:07:50] <catcher> coachz, jetskis, that is
[17:08:11] <coachz> hahaha
[17:20:08] <philaneous> has anyone used the espyn api?
[17:20:11] <philaneous> espn*
[17:30:10] <catcher> does .css() work by applying inline styles?
[17:31:07] <billygalbreath> catcher: from what i've seen, yes
[17:32:41] <philaneous> i need help with api anyone?
[17:34:21] <catcher> philaneous, do you have jquery questions? Or just about their api?
[17:34:32] <philaneous> well both
[17:34:48] <philaneous> http://developer.espn.com/docs/headlines#code-samples
[17:34:56] <catcher> ask away with jquery Q's..
[17:35:08] <philaneous> I'm trying to use that
[17:35:28] <catcher> k
[17:36:22] <philaneous> but i can't get anything to show up
[17:37:48] <catcher> philaneous, that's a pretty open-ended question, maybe you can jsfiddle your example that should be working?
[17:38:08] <philaneous> http://sulley.dm.ucf.edu/~ph713302/test/SemesterProject/
[17:38:36] <johnkpaul> hey MistuhKurtz, it was no problem, awesome site
[17:38:59] <catcher> philaneous, where's your submit button?
[17:39:01] <MistuhKurtz> ty
[17:39:12] <MistuhKurtz> client wants a pinterest feed on their custom facebook tab
[17:39:22] <philaneous> catcher: why would i need a submit button
[17:39:29] <philaneous> it just posts headlines
[17:39:59] <catcher> philaneous, because your js is set up to run the ajax call when a div with id "submit" is clicked.
[17:40:42] <philaneous> ooo
[17:40:48] <philaneous> mistake
[17:40:53] <philaneous> i should erase that
[17:40:56] <catcher> yup
[17:41:18] <philaneous> I'm not really good at this yet I'm pretty novice
[17:41:32] <philaneous> can i just leave the .$ajax function
[17:41:36] <philaneous> and the rest
[17:41:53] <catcher> philaneous, give it a go, ask another question if it doesn't work.
[17:42:09] <catcher> philaneous, Don't forget to remove the closing tag for the click handler at the bottom too.
[17:42:43] <catcher> philaneous, your css include path is incorrect too.
[17:43:09] <philaneous> catcher: i know i have to fix it i uploaded it to my server so i can show u
[17:43:18] <catcher> kk
[17:45:27] <philaneous> ok look at it now
[17:45:28] <philaneous> http://sulley.dm.ucf.edu/~ph713302/test/SemesterProject/
[17:46:11] <catcher> philaneous, it's the same
[17:46:24] <philaneous> catcher: check again
[17:46:38] <catcher> I did, you still have the click handler in there.
[17:46:38] <philaneous> hold onj
[17:48:27] <philaneous> sorry
[17:48:28] <philaneous> man
[17:48:38] <philaneous> there
[17:49:16] <catcher> philaneous, you got rid of the $(document).ready too, need that
[17:51:50] <philaneous> ok
[17:51:52] <philaneous> done
[17:52:24] <philaneous> it still doesn't display anything
[17:53:04] <philaneous> catcher: any ideas?
[17:53:56] <catcher> philaneous, ul.append(li) missing semicolon
[17:54:27] <philaneous> catcher: thats how i copied it from espn
[17:54:29] <philaneous> though
[17:54:37] <catcher> philaneous, please paste your code on jsfiddle.net so I or someone else can help out better
[17:56:34] <xenaxon> is there any possible way to keep music playing after a page has been changed?
[17:56:35] <philaneous> http://jsfiddle.net/UAgr6/
[17:56:44] <philaneous> catcher: http://jsfiddle.net/UAgr6/
[17:57:47] <catcher> xenaxon, Only if the page content is loaded via jQuery, but not on an actual page load.
[17:58:03] <xenaxon> you mean ajax
[17:58:05] <catcher> xenaxon, or you could run the player in a separate window.
[17:58:13] <catcher> xenaxon, doesn't need to be ajax.
[17:58:17] <xenaxon> but how can I open the player in a separate window
[17:58:25] <xenaxon> exactly on page load
[17:58:33] <catcher> xenaxon, but that's most common.
[17:58:35] <xenaxon> and without the popup being rejected by browser/plugins
[17:58:56] <xenaxon> yes, but the popup is closed by spam filters
[17:58:58] <catcher> xenaxon, you can't..
[17:59:21] <catcher> you need an actual new browser window.
[18:00:23] <philaneous> catcher: any ideas?
[18:03:27] <flacom> hi all..I'm adding items to a list using ajax, how can I append the an image from a theme next to the list item text? I want to use the icons from the jquery ui theme
[18:03:49] <philaneous> can anyone help me get this espy api to work http://jsfiddle.net/UAgr6/
[18:03:53] <philaneous> espn*
[18:05:12] <catcher> philaneous, the selector 'container' doesn't exist, it's a class.
[18:05:36] <catcher> add the semicolon I mentioned, and change it to $('.container').append(ul);
[18:06:06] <catcher> philaneous, you don't need the ul and li in your html either, since you're creating them.
[18:06:24] <philaneous> so how do i go about it
[18:06:30] <tw2113> philaneous i get a 403 error for that url
[18:06:37] <catcher> I just gave you the code..
[18:06:39] <tw2113> oops
[18:06:43] <tw2113> missed the api key
[18:06:45] <philaneous> lol
[18:07:01] <philaneous> catcher: i was talking about the html part
[18:07:08] <tw2113> much better
[18:07:10] <catcher> philaneous, you can leave it there if you like.
[18:07:11] <tw2113> ooh data
[18:07:35] <catcher> philaneous, I'm just telling you you'll have an empty set of ul and li since you're not replacing.
[18:07:36] * tw2113 touches dat data
[18:07:39] <catcher> ha
[18:08:22] <tw2113> it's so round and firm
[18:08:26] <philaneous> LOL
[18:08:32] <tw2113> er wait what? ah shit, this is the #jquery room
[18:08:46] * tw2113 runs away embarrassed
[18:08:57] <philaneous> catcher: so i can just leave the ul li elements in my html page correct
[18:09:11] <catcher> sure, you'll have an empty dot on top though.
[18:09:37] <philaneous> i would fix that in css?
[18:09:44] <catcher> ugh
[18:10:07] <philaneous> lol
[18:10:10] <catcher> Phil-Work, here: http://jsfiddle.net/UAgr6/2/
[18:10:26] <philaneous> ok
[18:10:36] <philaneous> now these are supposed to be hyperlinks to the story i presume
[18:10:42] <philaneous> stories**
[18:12:24] <tw2113> so throw in the headlines.links.web.href part in
[18:12:30] <tw2113> i think i referenced that href part right
[18:12:53] <tw2113> ooh wait
[18:13:07] <tw2113> this.links.web.href
[18:14:27] <philaneous> tw2113: are you editing the file?
[18:14:40] <tw2113> not to any degree that i'd hit update and paste
[18:14:57] <philaneous> how do i get them to hyperlink
[18:15:46] <catcher> philaneous, like tw2113 says, grab the hyperlink from the api and wrap your text items in it.
[18:15:59] <tw2113> construct <a href="'+this.links.web.href+'"> Some text</a>
[18:16:19] <catcher> gotta roll y'all, seeya
[18:16:25] <philaneous> thanks man
[18:16:25] <catcher> gl philaneous
[18:16:30] <tw2113> you have the actual url already, just need to wrap them in <a> tags
[18:16:30] <philaneous> catcher: you the man
[18:16:35] <catcher> philaneous, np
[18:16:42] <philaneous> tw2113: so use the api url?
[18:16:54] <tw2113> this one? http://api.espn.com/v1/sports/news/headlines?apikey=et6zpcwbgnp4ynvhdx69znbm
[18:17:18] <philaneous> use that one?

[18:21:01] <tw2113> do NOT do that again
[18:22:14] <dilvie> that was amazing.
[18:22:18] <shoky> o he's done
[18:22:36] <philaneous> i copied in here by accident sorry
[18:22:54] <shoky> we didnt see anything, weird
[18:22:55] <tw2113> we'll work with 1 headline

[18:23:09] <tw2113> you had this much data, philaneous, 468 times, in that paste
[18:23:25] <tw2113> except less white space
[18:23:38] <philaneous> ok
[18:23:59] <tw2113> do you see that "headline" part that has a value of "No Charges against Starlin Castro" ?
[18:24:10] <philaneous> yes
[18:24:18] <shoky> stalin castro o my
[18:24:20] <tw2113> that's your this.headline in your $.each()
[18:24:38] <tw2113> now, if you scroll down a little more, you should see "links"
[18:25:11] <philaneous> so i copy the links in my html
[18:25:41] <tw2113> i'd probably use this.links.web.href to reference that field in the $.each()
[18:26:04] <tw2113> on each iteration it'd reference that web href and if you wrap it in an <a> tag, it'll create a link to that href
[18:26:49] <philaneous> i don't think i completely understand you
[18:27:47] <tw2113> this won't be proper for copy/paste into your jsfiddle but
[18:28:24] <tw2113> <li/><a href=" this.links.web.href " title="something"> this.headline </a>
[18:29:21] <tw2113> you'd have to properly format that between js string and this reference
[18:29:56] <philaneous> can u give me an example
[18:30:40] <tw2113> if i had your fiddle link still, i'd do it up a bit for you
[18:30:49] <philaneous> its still up
[18:30:50] <philaneous> dude
[18:31:02] <tw2113> but i don't have it open in a tab any more

[18:31:14] <philaneous> i really appreciate this dude
[18:31:24] <tw2113> and i can't scroll up to find it after #epicpaste
[18:31:46] <philaneous> did u get the link
[18:32:10] <tw2113> just now, yes

[18:37:45] <tw2113> i modified some stuff for you
[18:38:27] <philaneous> tw2113: nice u did it in javascript
[18:38:44] <philaneous> so it gets it from the "this fucntion
[18:38:45] <philaneous> ?
[18:39:01] <tw2113> i figured you would have figured that based on how the headline was working
[18:39:12] <tw2113> and "this" references itself, if i fully understand it
[18:39:22] <tw2113> but in summary
[18:39:24] <philaneous> from the api?
[18:39:29] <tw2113> i created a variable of "headlines"
[18:39:36] <tw2113> added the opening ul tag
[18:39:41] <tw2113> entered the $.each()
[18:39:53] <tw2113> appended the <li> and <a> stuff to it
[18:40:05] <philaneous> ok i see
[18:40:09] <philaneous> question
[18:40:11] <tw2113> exited the $.each() and appended the closing <ul> tag to the variable
[18:40:21] <tw2113> the appended the headline var to #container
[18:40:33] <philaneous> ok
[18:40:38] <philaneous> i kinda see what you did
[18:40:55] <tw2113> i went for performance
[18:41:08] <tw2113> create 1 variable instead of regularly search through the dom and append stuff slowly
[18:41:18] <philaneous> right
[18:41:40] <tw2113> i'll shut up so you can ask questions
[18:41:53] <philaneous> don't shut up lol
[18:41:57] <philaneous> im learning as u you type bro
[18:42:04] <philaneous> I'm a no0b at rapid app development
[18:42:18] <tw2113> this is for an app?!?!
[18:42:18] <philaneous> so can i give ul css properties

[18:44:06] <philaneous> is there anyway to make the list longer?
[18:44:59] <tw2113> not sure why it's stopping at 10
[18:45:23] <philaneous> yeah because there no loop or array there
[18:45:24] <shoky> /oops
[18:45:28] <philaneous> weird right
[18:46:03] * tw2113 drinks the beer he was going to give shoky

[18:49:14] <tw2113> sometime tonight, i may get to work
[18:49:17] <tw2113> on my own work
[18:49:31] <tw2113> even with a desktop pc with graphics drivers errors
[18:50:01] <philaneous> tw2113: do u know how i can make the list longer?
[18:50:10] <tw2113> no, i was hoping someone else maybe did
[18:50:21] <philaneous> to add css properties to javascript elements
[18:50:36] <philaneous> i can append ul in css even though my html has none?
[18:50:48] <tw2113> take what i gave you, and inside the single quotes, add classes/ids whatever you need
[18:51:10] <tw2113> or just use #container ul { }
[18:51:23] <tw2113> there are many ways you could target all of that in just css
[18:51:32] <philaneous> ok good I'm not bad at css
[18:51:38] <philaneous> i was just wondering man
[18:52:06] <philaneous> i can do #container p{
[18:52:09] <philaneous> too right
[18:52:13] <tw2113> no P
[18:52:24] <tw2113> #container li, #container a
[18:52:33] <philaneous> oh write because its hyperlinked
[18:52:36] <philaneous> right***
[18:52:39] <philaneous> wow what a no0b
[18:52:43] <tw2113> and i didn't put paragraph tags in
[18:52:50] <philaneous> yeah i see
[18:53:07] <tw2113> hitting "view source" won't show you enough here
[18:53:20] <tw2113> you'll need firebug or chrome inspector to see the end results
[18:53:24] <tw2113> but css would apply
[18:54:04] <philaneous> i have firebug
[18:54:19] <tw2113> shoky do you ever sit back and wonder how anyone got any webdev work done before inspector tools?
[18:54:21] <philaneous> is that query file from google working in my code though?
[18:54:51] <philaneous> "https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.7.1
[18:55:08] <flacom> Hi.. I have a bunch of items with id="el-1", id="el-2", etc.. is possible to add the click listener to all those elements?
[18:55:15] <tw2113> i would assume so, because it seemed to be working originally and you had mootools selected along the side
[18:55:52] <tw2113> it was me that chose 1.7.2 i my updated fiddle
[18:56:23] <philaneous> its working though righ
[18:56:35] <tw2113> you wouldn't have results if it wasn't

[19:46:39] <bot-t> ML74, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[19:50:28] <ML74> it's all coded in the page
[19:50:33] <ML74> www.designbyml.com/washington
[19:50:46] <ML74> you'll see it in the source in header. menuspopup.js
[19:52:54] <JavaLover> is there a way in jquery to submit a form?
[19:53:03] <JavaLover> actually my real question is this...
[19:53:13] <JavaLover> I have a form i'd like to cause the submit without actually using the form is this possible?
[19:53:35] <JavaLover> I know the form action is like "user/login" and then theres a submit button that sends a url along with it
[19:54:16] <JavaLover> i mean I guess I could hide the form but what i'd like to do is get rid of the form & make it a javascript function
[19:54:55] <JavaLover> <form id="openid_form" method="get" action="public/user/login"> see i'd like to just convert this form into a javascript function
[19:54:57] <philaneous> anyone know how i can more listed on this http://jsfiddle.net/UAgr6/11/
[20:00:34] <Randomage> Hey everyone.
[20:01:30] <Randomage> I'm having troubles with jquery-ui's autocomplete, the dropdown div's size is completely fsck'd up, how can I give it better dimensions?
[20:03:01] <ML74> Could someone help me with a jQuery popup window not loading? I can't find why it's not loading, and the code for it all seems to be correct. http://www.designbyml.com/washington/. It should load under Dining and clicking "Menu Name" in the content on the right.
[20:05:37] <JavaLover> i solved it btw
[20:05:38] <xp_prg> it is possible to set a callback function on a jquery datatables instance after it has been created?
[20:05:43] <JavaLover> i decoded the form into public/user/login?openid_identifier=https://www.twitter.com
[20:06:05] <JavaLover> basically you take the value & that becomes a variable after ?  and then what it = and use that as a url
[20:09:20] <xenaxon> guys. help
[20:09:26] <xenaxon> How can I make a fixed div
[20:09:44] <xenaxon> that slides only after the scrollbar has gone down
[20:10:16] <xenaxon> I mean, when the page is not scrolled, the div should stay fixed to the left side at a certain distance in pixels from the top
[20:31:01] <Whirl3d> ML74, did you get my earlier post?
[20:31:01] <Whirl3d> It shows up for me, ML74
[20:31:21] <ML74> Whirl3d: What post?
[20:31:42] <Whirl3d> Earlier about your popup issue.
[20:31:54] <LukeNukem> sup Whirl3d
[20:32:02] <Whirl3d> I see it when I click on Dining, btw. It's just behind the grey panel
[20:32:15] <Whirl3d> Hey LukeNukem
[20:32:38] <LukeNukem> how you doing?
[20:33:15] <Whirl3d> hangin in there, and you?
[20:33:19] <ML74> Have a look now Whirl3d
[20:33:30] <LukeNukem> Whirl3d, doing some serverside js
[20:33:31] <ML74> is it still showing when you click Menu Name?
[20:33:37] <Whirl3d> ML74, you have too many items at zindex:9999999999999
[20:33:39] <ML74> If so, what browser?
[20:33:54] <ML74> it's fixed now
[20:34:03] <ML74> but still not working with that link
[20:34:44] <Whirl3d> Where do you assing the click handler for it?
[20:35:34] <Whirl3d> my keyboard is a wreck. Sorry. assigning
[20:35:57] <ML74> within <head>
[20:36:01] <ML74> should i move to footer?
[20:36:57] <ML74> works with all other links though :/
[20:37:26] <Whirl3d> Tell me the line number that you assign the handler for the a.button element
[20:37:27] <LukeNukem> Whirl3d, is there a setTimeout thingie for jquery
[20:37:59] <Whirl3d> LukeNukem, have you looked?
[20:38:25] <Whirl3d> Because yes, it's called setTimeout
[20:38:51] <LukeNukem> what aboot .delay
[20:38:51] <ML74> Whirl3d: 22
[20:39:12] <Whirl3d> where in menupopuip
[20:39:30] <ML74> line 49
[20:39:50] <Whirl3d> that link isn't in the #navbar
[20:39:59] <Whirl3d> it's in the sidebar or content bar or something...
[20:40:05] <ML74> it isn't meant to be
[20:40:11] <ML74> it's in the text on the dining paye
[20:40:14] <ML74> **page
[20:40:23] <ML74> "Menu Name" is the link
[20:40:45] <Whirl3d> Your selector on line 49 says "#navbar li a "    so only links in the nav bar are handled
[20:41:20] <ML74> when did you last refresh the page?
[20:41:39] <ML74> refresh and try again. i changed that back to a.button 5 mins ago.
[20:41:51] <Whirl3d> IT"S NOT IN THE NAV BAR
[20:42:23] <ML74> what's not in the navbar?
[20:42:30] <ML74> what are you talking about?
[20:42:31] <Whirl3d> wow
[20:43:11] <Whirl3d> you think that $("#navbar li a").click(function () {     is handling your click event. BUT ONLY for LI A elements in the NAVBAR
[20:43:21] <Whirl3d> hence the #navbar selector
[20:43:24] <ML74> REFRESH THE PAGE
[20:43:32] <Whirl3d> I did,
[20:43:37] <Whirl3d> I have
[20:43:38] <ML74> it's currently a.button. not #navbar li a
[20:47:41] <ML74> i used #navbar li a and it worked. but when i use a.button, it stops working when i click a <a class="button">Menu Name</a>
[20:51:17] <Whirl3d> Sorry about that. My pc crapped out. I thought it was my keyboard. LOL
[20:52:38] <Whirl3d> ML74, if you copy the code from menupopup.js and paste it into the console. It works fine
[20:53:40] <Whirl3d> So is it possible that the a.button Menu Name link is being added _after_ the page has loaded?
[20:55:18] <xp_prg> I see this:  "fnPreDrawCallback": function( oSettings ) {
[20:55:40] <xp_prg> can I put a function name instead of function(oSettings) { ?
[20:57:01] <Whirl3d> if you mean can you replace the anonymous function assigned to fnPreDrawCallback with a varialble name, sure. You just say var func=function ( .....and then fnPreDrawCallck:func;
[20:57:41] <xp_prg> cool thanks :>
[20:58:24] <Whirl3d> ML74, it has to have something to do with changin the sections. I can get the link to work with your original code on the Dining page. But go back to home and then to dining and it doesn't work again.
[21:08:46] <Rancid> So quiet this evening.
[21:19:59] <dr0id> go sleep then
[21:20:16] <Whirl3d> you talkin to me?
[21:47:32] <shoky> xp_prg: you can always use a named function in place of an anonymous one
[21:47:50] <snookinhersnizz> When a user pastes a URI into a text input, I want to display in a thumbnail area the image specified by  <meta property="og:image" content="thumbnailURI" /> on the page of the URI given by the user if there is any.  Is this possible, or would I need to post the inputted URI back to the server, fetch / parse the document, then return the thumbnail address back to jquery?
[21:48:17] <shoky> sometimes its very annoying that my name is uri
[21:49:26] <shoky> snookinhersnizz: that depends
[21:50:03] <snookinhersnizz> Oh, hey shoky! :)
[21:50:19] <shoky> if it's in a different domain and there's no JSONP api or someth then i think you can't
[21:50:35] <shoky> if it's in the same domain you sure can
[21:53:22] <snookinhersnizz> shoky: when u get back (or anyone else in the meantime): it'll always be a different host for the link.  How would you tell if there's a json api?
[21:55:13] <Whirl3d> Is it ANY random host the user supplies or is it a host from a select group of hosts that you could lookup in advance?
[21:56:01] <snookinhersnizz> Whirl3d: ANY random host.
[21:56:21] <snookinhersnizz> though likely the set follows the pareto principle.
[21:56:27] <snookinhersnizz> (80/20) rule.
[21:57:04] <obert-> hello, trying to use jquery cycle plugin but it is adding some inline css styles, do you know perhaps if i could easily remove them?
[21:57:37] <Whirl3d> I don't know of any way to do what you want to do because of Same Origin Policy. Perhaps Google or Alexa would have a service that would lookup the site, generate a thumbnail and return it via jsonp. I doubt it, but maybe.
[21:58:13] <obert-> uh there's an option width that i didnt noticed before.sorry
[21:58:18] <snookinhersnizz> Whirl3d: yes, that would certainly be ideal.
[21:58:45] <snookinhersnizz> How could you circumvent the same origin pol by knowing the finite set of sites though?
[21:59:01] <Whirl3d> there are plugins that do that for google results, for example. Maybe they offer a service to do it.
[21:59:47] <Whirl3d> If you knew that 5 sites, for example, were going to be listed, technically you could contact those sites and pre-arrange a JSONP connection (api) to do it
[22:00:00] <obert-> fit: 1, atm:)
[22:00:50] <Whirl3d> But that would entirely depend on the sites and since you don't know them in advance, there's no universal JSONP API doorknocker, if you will
[22:01:15] <snookinhersnizz> But wouldn't you still be violating XSS?
[22:01:29] <snookinhersnizz> even if you arranged an API? also, that would require cooperation from each of the sites, no?
[22:01:41] <Whirl3d> Precisely.
[22:02:26] <Whirl3d> some sites provide this automatically---like facebook/flickr, etc. They have ways of authenticating your request and therefore they allow you to do things like that via jsonp.
[22:04:39] <snookinhersnizz> right, but are you still not violating the browsers same origin pol?
[22:05:28] <Whirl3d> somehow, jsonp allows you to run javascripts to access data without violating SOP. I don't really understand it all.
[22:06:49] <systemfault> Whirl3d: Because it's a hack, the server creates a javascript file containing a function call passing the object
[22:06:55] <wookiehangover> it works by script tag insertion
[22:07:31] <wookiehangover> more of a work around than a "hack" per se
[22:08:35] <snookinhersnizz> ahhh. wookiehangover thats trippy.
[22:08:36] <Whirl3d> right on. Thanks for the info.
[22:08:47] <wookiehangover> http://bob.pythonmac.org/archives/2005/12/05/remote-json-jsonp/
[22:08:53] <wookiehangover> that's what the jquery docs link to
[22:10:17] <wookiehangover> but jquery handles all the bullshit for you
[22:10:50] <Whirl3d> I think they call it "magic" thank you...
[22:10:52] <Whirl3d> lol
[22:11:02] <obert-> 1 == false,correct?O_o
[22:11:18] <wookiehangover> but for all intents and purposes it should work with just about any x-domain endpoint that responds with json
[22:11:19] <Whirl3d> ?eval(1)
[22:11:21] <bot-t> Whirl3d, #8784 (globalEval dont allow to catch exceptions) – jQuery Core ... - Opened 10 months ago http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/8784
[22:11:30] <Whirl3d> ignore that
[22:11:39] <wookiehangover> ?eval 1 == false
[22:11:40] <Whirl3d> 1=true
[22:11:40] <bot-t> wookiehangover: false
[22:11:53] <wookiehangover> ?eval 0 === false
[22:11:53] <bot-t> wookiehangover: false
[22:12:08] <obert-> ??
[22:12:19] <Whirl3d> eval 1 == true
[22:12:19] <wookiehangover> ?eval 1 == true

[22:12:48] <bot-t> wookiehangover: 1
[22:15:24] <_zoggy_> 0 === false would be false
[22:16:11] <snookinhersnizz> obert- === is for stiff typing
[22:16:11] <snookinhersnizz> == is for loose typed comparisons.
[22:29:05] <Wilornel> Guys, is it through jquery that we constantly check for new changes for, by example, a chatbox?
[22:30:58] <_zoggy_> youd use ajax most likely
[22:31:06] <Wilornel> Alright thanks
[22:36:42] <Whirl3d> so, if $("list").animate(....) animates each element and performs callbacks on each element, then how much faster is it that $("list").each(function () {$(this).animate_.......   ?
[22:37:03] <Whirl3d> is it than*
[22:48:01] <andrew9183> anyone use bootstrap ?
[22:48:38] <shoky> h
[22:51:14] <LukeNukem> andrew9183, trying to lol :3
[22:57:03] <Whirl3d> Can someone explain: If target is provided, .promise() will attach the methods onto it and then return this object rather than create a new one. This can be useful to attach the Promise behavior to an object that already exists.
[23:08:07] <snookinhersnizz> Whirl3d: sorry, i can't help you.  but mind if i pm for something?
[23:08:19] <Whirl3d> sure
[23:10:40] <hyperstream> Is WebDAV popular method for working with remote files? more so than say FTP ?
[23:15:31] <shoky> Whirl3d what don't you get?
[23:16:26] <shoky> you can call var p = $( .. ).promise()     this way you get a new object created for you that has the promise interface
[23:16:59] <shoky> or you can:   var p = ....;      $( .. ).promise(p)    to just add the promise interface to the existing object p
[23:17:43] <shoky> well not just the interface, it's a link to the jq obj's queue-deferred-smth
[23:20:16] <Dr-Bombay> I've never called the method that way, but it seems to be the difference between calling someone on their own telephone vs. giving them an extra telephone to receive the call
[23:20:49] <samzhao_> hi everyone!
[23:21:28] <shoky> Dr-Bombay do you mean, you don't see how it can be useful?
[23:22:46] <Dr-Bombay> I wasn't asking how it was useful
[23:23:08] <Dr-Bombay> I wasn't asking anything about it
[23:23:17] <shoky> i didn't say you were asking anything
[23:23:32] <shoky> i was giving my interpretation of your analogy
[23:24:19] <shoky> (and asking if you agree with it)
[23:25:06] <shoky> then you got defensive and stopped talking
[23:25:10] <shoky> now i'm all alone
[23:25:32] <Dr-Bombay> not defensive, just bewildered by the question
[23:25:52] <shoky> hokay
[23:25:53] <abjorn1> COLDHEAD
[23:25:55] <abjorn1> AREYOU THERE
[23:26:02] <shoky> isn't he always
[23:35:58] <Whirl3d> sorry, I didn't realize you had replied. And thank you,btw
[23:36:54] <shoky> sup,btw
[23:37:00] <Whirl3d> I guess what I am confused about is this: in my plugin(which extends the $.fn. namespace, I need to return a promise in order to allow this kind of callback linking, right:
[23:37:11] <Whirl3d> $(el).something().done(function)
[23:37:21] <Whirl3d> where something is my plugin name
[23:37:55] <Whirl3d> I could return the deferred, but it would give access to the resolve and fail methods--promise prohibits that
[23:38:26] <Whirl3d> But I guess I don't undestand what the target is then
[23:38:34] <Whirl3d> is it the deferred or the collection
[23:38:36] <shoky> um
[23:38:53] <Whirl3d> and is the collection providing the interface ".done" or the promise?
[23:38:59] <shoky> in a plugin you usually return the jq collection
[23:39:25] <shoky> mm
[23:39:27] <Whirl3d> I realize that. But some don't and this one in particular, I would rather return a promise
[23:40:13] <Whirl3d> unless of course the jquery object ihas the promise's interface (as the description I posted seemed to indicate)'
[23:40:35] <shoky> why does it indicate that?
[23:40:54] <shoky> it has a .promise() function, not a promise interface
[23:41:15] <Whirl3d> .promise() will attach the methods onto it and then return this object rather than create a new one. This can be useful to attach the Promise behavior to an object that already exists.
[23:41:26] <shoky> yeah
[23:41:30] <Whirl3d> when it says "this object" what is it referreing to?
[23:42:05] <shoky> to the target given as argument
[23:42:18] <shoky> var p = ....;      $( .. ).promise(p)
[23:42:25] <Whirl3d> So how is it related to my deferred?
[23:42:27] <shoky> now you can call p.done(..) etc
[23:42:36] <Whirl3d> or does it just imply a new deferred
[23:43:04] <shoky> $( .. ).promise()  is only related to the jq obj's deferred
[23:43:31] <osirisx111> hi.. what is a simple way to do fixed header tables?
[23:43:34] <shoky> if you alrady have a deferred
[23:43:35] <shoky> hmm
[23:43:52] <shoky> wait
[23:43:57] <Whirl3d> Right now, I return defferred.promise()
[23:44:09] <shoky> is your  something() function also used in chaining?
[23:44:19] <shoky> or, do you want it to be
[23:44:34] <shoky> so you can .something().fadeOut(..) or whatever
[23:45:14] <shoky> oh
[23:45:26] <Whirl3d> Basically, I am changing the animate function to work the way I need it. So I am wrapping it (for all intents) in a plugin that provides callbacks at the beginning, during, and once complete both for the elements and the collection as a whole
[23:45:27] <shoky> you want  deferred.promise( target )
[23:45:50] <shoky> you should: return myDeferred.promise( theJqCollection )
[23:46:01] <shoky> i think.
[23:46:28] <shoky> then you're returning the jq collection, extended with your deferred's promise
[23:46:44] <shoky> ?deferred.promise
[23:46:45] <bot-t> deferred.promise([target]): Return a Deferred's Promise object. http://api.jquery.com/deferred.promise/
[23:46:50] <Whirl3d> So, I want to be able to do something like $("element").loadContent(url).then(showContent, removeContent);
[23:47:06] <shoky> yeah i think you'll be able to
[23:47:10] <shoky> ah no
[23:47:12] <shoky> hmm
[23:47:16] <shoky> well i guess yeah.
[23:47:17] <shoky> ;D
[23:47:38] <Whirl3d> and loadContent is a simple plugin that right now returns my deferred's promise   aparently with no target
[23:48:48] <Whirl3d> Amongother issues, I was looking for a way to avoid showing an element and fading it back out because I used the fadeOut() method on it (and it was already faded out).
[23:49:51] <snookinhersnizz> Does anyone know what the name of the plugin that does what I want for google results that Whirl3d mentioned earlier is?
[23:50:08] <snookinhersnizz> ie, provide a thumbnail for the linked pages in google results?
[23:50:19] <Whirl3d> Or if I had a really long animation duration on an element to get it to state b and I call it on an element that's already at state b, currently I have to wait (or stop) until the animation duration is complete. I wouldlike to just skip it and figured a resolved deferred would do that
[23:50:50] <shoky> didn't uinderstand the issue
[23:50:51] <Whirl3d> Like I said, I don't know that any service like that exists...it might (maybe Alexa does it?)
[23:52:07] <shoky> actually what i said about extending the jq obj seems bad
[23:52:20] <shoky> best to just return the promise like you're doing
[23:54:17] <shoky> trying it with chaining and it works pretty good actually
[23:54:31] <shoky> so yea extend the jq obj !!
[23:54:47] <shoky> ?eval $.Deferred()
[23:54:48] <bot-t> shoky: TypeError: $.Deferred is not a function
[23:54:58] <shoky> ?eval $
[23:54:58] <bot-t> shoky: <function (selector, context) {return new (jQuery.fn.init)(selector, context);}>
[23:55:09] <Whirl3d> so, now I have to wonder why the limited functionationality of a deferred? Why not make it reausable, resettable. an external , but private, event system customized to the target
[23:55:10] <shoky> ?eval $('<div/>');
[23:55:11] <bot-t> shoky: [<div>]
[23:56:04] <shoky> Whirl3d that'd really depend on the intended usage of your function/plugin
[23:56:45] <Whirl3d> shokky, thanks for discussing this with me. These are just questions I have been rolling around in my head, so if I get on your nerves asking, just tell me.
[23:56:46] <Whirl3d> lol
[23:57:37] <shoky> but usually it makes sense to return a promise because your plugin or whatever should be in charge of resolving/rejecting the deferred
[23:57:58] <Whirl3d> right. That's what I have been doing
[23:58:13] <Whirl3d> but should I have a deferred for every "state" of an animation?
[23:58:26] <Whirl3d> so that outside elements could subscribe to them?
[23:59:08] <shoky> didn't really understand your animation issue sorry
[23:59:20] <shoky> i'm beat and actually i'll go to bed now ;)
[23:59:21] <Whirl3d> The startDeferred would resolve once the animation started, the endDeferred would resolve for each element and then a final big deferred would resolve once all the elements were done
[23:59:38] <Whirl3d> Thanks again for your help and insight. Sleep well.
