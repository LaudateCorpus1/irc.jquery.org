[00:10:10] <m1911> hi
[00:11:16] <m1911> if i hava '$' in id, in jquery , $('id') exsists error?
[00:12:28] <arc_> $('#id')
[00:13:00] <m1911> if id=$test, $('#$test') error
[00:13:47] <arc_> that's not very surprising to me
[00:15:36] <arc_> i wouldn't use $ in any id or class names, even though it's technically valid
[00:21:01] <m1911> orz
[00:21:11] <m1911> just a bug
[00:21:15] <m1911> in my code
[00:26:37] <ling2> http://jsfiddle.net/VZ3T5/1/. does anyone know why i placed same code in D7, and it doesn't work as it is. thx
[00:36:46] <Uhkis> ling2: by default, D7 uses very old jquery, which doesnt have .on() yet
[00:38:24] <Uhkis> ling2: you also need to use a wrapper in order to use $() instead of jQuery()
[00:51:01] <ling2> Uhkis: that's what i thougt jquery version is too old. but do you know how to make it work like that in D7. thx
[01:58:53] <Tirant_lo_Blanc> D7 has a module that could be useful: jquery_update

[02:58:19] <surianup> Hello
[02:59:22] <surianup> I am trying use the multiple auto complete input box but I need to use ajax
[02:59:22] <surianup> https://jsfiddle.net/dbe9j9Ld/1/
[02:59:34] <surianup> please help me how to use the ajax in this
[05:23:23] <steveOrElse> hey everyone! Got a noob question about jquery, ajax and http.
[05:25:33] <steveOrElse> I've got a log-in form that I need to submit. Basically, I need to attach an "Authenticate" http header to my request and perform a GET to a secured location
[05:27:48] <steveOrElse> server checks the credentials and either redirects or grants access. So the question is: how to attach that header and perform a GET request with it? I understand that I can use ajax and assign headers, but it feels very odd to receive a page as data to ajax's callback, then do some document.open-write-close stuff.
[05:28:26] <steveOrElse> and of course I need that header to stay
[05:33:34] <Dorian-Grim> I have http://pastebin.com/bngaB2ti. How can I target the UL from the IMG?
[06:07:25] <steveOrElse> can't really tell why 570 people are online for.
[06:52:18] <AdamPDotty> steveOrElse, lmgtfy: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10093053/add-header-in-ajax-request-with-jquery
[07:00:25] <steveOrElse> AdamPDotty: that's quite clear, but I couldn't understand what to do next. Now I found out that I can return a response with Location header from server to make client redirect
[07:03:15] <AdamPDotty> as you are in javascript context you cann do a simple window.location.href = '';
[07:03:41] <steveOrElse> or location.assign, I guess
[07:04:19] <steveOrElse> I just couldn't tell, whether the header will stay or not for further requests, if it is sent by ajax that way
[07:05:31] <taplar> you mean subsequent calls?
[07:05:31] <AdamPDotty> header is just for one request
[07:05:34] <taplar> ^
[07:05:48] <AdamPDotty> you can set a cookie, but the user might reject or change it.
[07:06:34] <taplar> Dorian-Grim: do you already have the img in context?
[07:07:06] <Dorian-Grim> taplar I solved it with this.parentNode.parentNode.parentNode
[07:07:12] <taplar> use closest
[07:07:20] <taplar> $(this).closest('ul')
[07:07:51] <Dorian-Grim> hmm, very good to know, but the UL has dynamics
[07:08:01] <taplar> ?
[07:08:53] <Dorian-Grim> I actually need to remove the Li, not the UL
[07:08:56] <Dorian-Grim> pardon
[07:09:10] <taplar> $(this).closest('li').remove()
[07:09:31] <Dorian-Grim> I will remove a UL child, which I don't want
[07:09:46] <Dorian-Grim>  I want to remove the li (row)
[07:09:51] <Dorian-Grim> it's ok. I understand now
[07:09:56] <Dorian-Grim> tyvm
[08:32:58] <Sagar> why this isn't detecting my function? https://jsfiddle.net/zjaqmpqw/2/
[08:33:45] <decx> dont use inline events
[08:33:55] <decx> they need functions to be in the global scope
[08:34:54] <taplar> inlines also don't bind to 'this'
[08:37:08] <Sagar> What should i do then?
[08:37:13] <Sagar> noob in here
[08:37:15] <Sagar> please guide
[08:40:50] <Sagar> ?
[08:43:41] <DFar> Hi all, i'm stuck with my click listener and an ajax call here https://jsfiddle.net/15g7beza/ .  can someone explain me an other way to proceed ?
[08:46:54] <FilipNortic> DFar: unbind is pre jQuery 1.7
[08:47:10] <FilipNortic> they use on and off now
[08:48:03] <Uhkis> DFar: https://jsfiddle.net/15g7beza/1/
[08:48:43] <DFar> FilipNortic: Ok, i'm ready something about that
[08:50:15] <DFar> So, there is no need to execute the .on after the "append", i'm right ?
[08:50:51] <Uhkis> execute on?
[08:51:26] <FilipNortic> well it depends what element you place your click handler on
[08:52:30] <DFar> by "execute .on" i mean 'attach an event listener' or something like that
[08:52:30] <FilipNortic> and if you delage the event properly (always mix up delagte and defer) but i think it delegate on events
[08:53:45] <FilipNortic> if you want the event to trigger on a element you added after the ready call then you need to attach your lisener to a parrent that is present on page load
[08:56:07] <DFar> ok,  as in my example,  this parent is already on page, so there's no need to attach to a parent
[08:57:25] <DFar> Now i'm understand better the .on and the delegating system
[08:59:59] <Uhkis> DFar: no. dynamically created elements bindings need to be attached to the pre-existing parent. like: $(parent).on('click', 'dynamically createde child', function(){});
[09:00:45] <FilipNortic> DFar: and you might wanna be carefull with returning false from event handlers
[09:01:36] <FilipNortic> it can do strange thing to your delegation chain
[09:01:48] <DFar> ok, it's just what i'm doing right now with .on and not with .unbind (and it works fine)
[09:02:24] <Uhkis> what was the unbind for anyways?
[09:03:11] <DFar> FilipNortic: how can i test a 'return false' from event handlers ? in order to prevent strange comportment ?
[09:03:37] <FilipNortic> the usall answer in here is don't do it
[09:04:37] <FilipNortic> DFar: do you need to have it retun false?
[09:04:48] <DFar> Uhkis: For open a Lightbox with dynamic content created after the page is full loaded
[09:05:53] <DFar> FilipNortic : You mean, i should delete the "return false;" line in my code ?
[09:06:26] <FilipNortic> if you don't think uou need it I would recomend doing that yes
[09:07:22] <DFar> Understood, I don't need it, it will be commented now, thank you
[09:08:57] <suexec> I need to find() child elements that have a certain attribute . .but the attribute may vary. I have tried: $('.tree li:has(ul)').find("[data-menu='notInstalled']","[data-menu='outOfSync']") , but it obviously doesn't work. What's the correct syntax?
[09:10:00] <DFar> See you later, and thank you again
[09:14:17] <decx> suexec: collect all potential children and then filter
[09:14:47] <decx> also find('sel1,sel1') works just fine
[09:15:02] <decx> it's a single argument separated by comma not separate arguments
[09:15:48] <suexec> decx, so .find("[name='test',name='test2']"); is valid ?
[09:20:14] <decx> no
[09:20:33] <decx> find('[name=test], [name=test2]') would be tho
[10:07:05] <midori-rus> Hello there. If I load select to a page dinamically, and later try to get selected option value, It returns me allways val of selected element which was loaded before. Why when I change option it still returns me an old selected value?
[10:09:20] <decx> you do stuff wrong
[11:28:18] <bongjovi> does anyone know how I would get the target from a node (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Node) ?
[11:28:50] <bongjovi> similar to event.target?
[11:29:06] <VeryBewitching> bongjovi: event.target is a node
[11:29:34] <bongjovi> oh, so with jquery I could do $(node) ?
[11:30:33] <VeryBewitching> $('#my-id').on('click', function(ev) { console.log ev.target === $('#my-id'); });
[11:31:07] <VeryBewitching> Or rather $(ev.target) === $('#my-id')
[11:31:34] <VeryBewitching> In any case, console.log is your friend
[11:31:48] <bongjovi> in my case it's $('#my-id').mouseup(function(){ $(document.getSelection().anchornode) });
[11:32:13] <bongjovi> as I'm using document.getSelection() to grab highlighted text
[11:32:23] <bongjovi> thanks, seems to work
[11:32:31] <bongjovi> i hadn't realized event.target was a node
[12:52:15] <berto> Hello
[12:55:45] <robertmaxrees> hello!
[12:56:35] <ABM_Dan> jquery doesn't have a nth-match selector in the core, does it?
[12:57:35] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[12:57:52] <ABM_Dan> css4's nth-match.
[12:58:28] <ABM_Dan> like .my-class:nth-match(even) matches every other item with class my-class
[12:58:30] <robertmaxrees> fwiw there's no "css4" - i think it's the css selector module level 4, and probably not yet.
[12:58:47] <robertmaxrees> jquery does have :even and :odd though.
[12:59:03] <ABM_Dan> That's why I'm checking if jquery has a way to do it that doesn't ask me to use filter.
[12:59:10] <robertmaxrees> i'
[12:59:11] <ABM_Dan> I know but I need every 5th.
[12:59:13] <robertmaxrees> *i'd just use filter.
[12:59:32] <robertmaxrees> or do your calculations serverside.
[12:59:38] <robertmaxrees> why not use filter?
[12:59:44] <ABM_Dan> Convenience.
[12:59:49] <robertmaxrees> hahaha.
[12:59:55] <robertmaxrees> filter is awesome for stuff like this imo.
[12:59:56] <robertmaxrees> but okay.
[13:00:00] <taplar> or change it so you can get away from position based logic
[13:00:01] <ABM_Dan> I will use filter, but if there was sinctactic sugar, I would have used that.
[13:00:14] <ABM_Dan> *syntactic
[13:00:20] <robertmaxrees> i don't even use the syntactic sugar most of the time.  .filter(), .on(), etc.
[13:00:33] <ABM_Dan> *shrug*
[13:00:40] <robertmaxrees> also: a lot of the jquery extended selectors are slow and not actually syntactic sugar
[13:00:40] <ABM_Dan> It's more readable, most of the time.
[13:01:08] <robertmaxrees> i disagree - .filter() tends to be more readbale to me.
[13:01:11] <robertmaxrees> and a lot of the devs i work with.
[13:01:24] <robertmaxrees> but that's anecdotal so ymmv
[13:01:25] <ABM_Dan> that's one heck of a blanket statement.
[13:01:53] <ABM_Dan> .filter being more readable than :even or :odd makes me ponder.
[13:02:27] <robertmaxrees> i tend to do those kinds of things server-side when possible.  otherwise, pure css.
[13:03:20] <robertmaxrees> but like I said, ymmv
[13:03:51] <ABM_Dan> Sadly I'm coloring pips generated by nouislider, which puts both pips and labels for pips on the same level, so nth-child is unusable.
[13:04:39] <robertmaxrees> why's that?
[13:05:00] <ABM_Dan> .filter(function( index ) {return index % 5 === 0}) simple enough
[13:05:14] <ABM_Dan> well, say I want to make every 5th pip slightly taller
[13:05:25] <robertmaxrees> what's a "pip" i guess is my real question.
[13:05:57] <ABM_Dan> the small notches that mark the steps of a scale?
[13:06:02] <robertmaxrees> ah
[13:06:04] <robertmaxrees> wonder if you could use nth-of-type instead.
[13:06:10] <robertmaxrees> eiuther way, fair enough.
[13:06:14] <ABM_Dan> Sadly no, they are all divs.
[13:06:18] <ABM_Dan> But I did think of it.
[13:06:27] <robertmaxrees> can't target classes instead?
[13:06:40] <robertmaxrees> i seem to recall nouislider being pretty flexible with that, but i could be wrong.
[13:06:43] <ABM_Dan> nth-of-type looks at the node type
[13:06:53] <robertmaxrees> ah, fair enough.
[13:07:00] <ABM_Dan> nth-match is what would do it in css.
[13:07:12] <robertmaxrees> right, psuedo class.
[13:07:54] <ABM_Dan> tbh I don't know why they bothered with nth-child or nth-of-type when nth-match can probably emulate both
[13:08:14] <robertmaxrees> because that's what they decided on when they did the spec?
[13:08:31] <robertmaxrees> and they didn't think of nth-match a the time?>
[13:08:51] <ABM_Dan> Yeah watching W3C and WHATWG at work was a... strange experience.
[13:08:59] <robertmaxrees> heh.
[13:09:18] <robertmaxrees> W3C is playing catch-up, WHATWG is a bunch of frustrated browser vendors who are throwing a collective tantrum.
[13:30:30] <hellyeah> hey
[13:30:33] <hellyeah> sup
[13:30:37] <robertmaxrees> yo
[13:32:40] <hellyeah> it is my last effort. Taplar fixed some part of the code. But the idea is mine what do you think? http://jsfiddle.net/x1j739pt/19/
[13:33:31] <taplar> your bottom switch still looks like it has a lot of potential redundancy
[13:33:41] <robertmaxrees> you're repeating yourself a lot in there
[13:33:58] <taplar> your also setting the data elements on every event, instead of just once
[13:34:17] <robertmaxrees> $('.month2') - make each of these a div class="month" and then add a data attribute for the number.
[13:34:26] <taplar> he already has that
[13:34:30] <robertmaxrees> do that server-side instead of client side.
[13:34:40] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, use .each() to set the number instead.
[13:34:43] <hellyeah> server-s,de
[13:34:45] <Jagst3r15> So I am nearly done with my project, but I decided to use: https://github.com/selz/plyr and I see an event called "playing. Based on this code: http://pastebin.com/yMa1vfji I am trying to detect if the video is "playing", hence line 12, but I can't get this to work...am I doing anything wrong?
[13:34:45] <hellyeah> hmm
[13:35:19] <hellyeah> understood
[13:35:28] <hellyeah> but do i have improvement?
[13:35:42] <taplar> idk what you changed between the other day and today
[13:35:46] <taplar> it's a sizable fiddle
[13:35:49] <robertmaxrees> Jagst3r15 you it's an event - .on('playing', function() {});
[13:35:55] <z1haze> will $(el).find('span').hide() hide all elements it finds or just the first one?
[13:36:13] <robertmaxrees> that'll do all spans that are under $(el)
[13:36:15] <robertmaxrees> z1haze
[13:36:20] <z1haze> awesome thank you
[13:37:17] <taplar> $(el).addClass('hideSpans');   .hideSpans span { display: none; } :P
[13:37:24] <Jagst3r15> robertmaxrees where would .on('playing', function() {}) go?
[13:37:34] <robertmaxrees> you'd bind an event listener to the player.
[13:39:41] <gambl0re> hi robert
[13:39:51] <robertmaxrees> hello.
[13:41:55] <Jagst3r15> robertmaxrees like http://hastebin.com/lavebemoxe.js ?
[13:42:17] <robertmaxrees> erm./
[13:42:23] <robertmaxrees> don't bind one in the other.
[13:42:31] <Jagst3r15> what do you mean
[13:42:33] <robertmaxrees> looks like oyu just need ended.
[13:43:04] <robertmaxrees> also, don't mix .bind() with .on() - use .on() always.
[13:43:41] <Jagst3r15> well I want to detect if it is playing
[13:43:49] <Jagst3r15> by using the playing event from the plyr thing
[13:44:05] <robertmaxrees> that's fine, but the example you made doesn't make any sense.
[13:44:19] <robertmaxrees> you don't want to bind an event listener inside of another even listener.
[13:44:54] <Jagst3r15> well I am esentall trying to wrap jQuery(this).find('.question-video').on('ended',function(){ in an if statement to detect if the video is actively playing
[13:45:04] <robertmaxrees> you can't do that.
[13:45:08] <Jagst3r15> oh
[13:45:11] <robertmaxrees> you can only detect if the event fired.
[13:45:18] <robertmaxrees> rather, when the event fires.
[13:45:23] <Jagst3r15> not even with like a var isPlaying = blah blah
[13:45:34] <robertmaxrees> you could if you wanted to.  not sure why you would, though.
[13:45:36] <Jagst3r15> and the if(isPlaying = true) {
[13:45:49] <robertmaxrees> that would just be if (isPlaying) { in that case.
[13:46:02] <robertmaxrees> check the plugin and see if it offers some kind of "isPlaying" method.
[13:46:16] <Jagst3r15> I checked, they just have "playing"
[13:46:20] <Jagst3r15> :/
[13:46:24] <robertmaxrees> as a method?
[13:46:26] <robertmaxrees> or event?
[13:46:40] <Jagst3r15> they have a playing event
[13:46:52] <robertmaxrees> then you'd have to set that status bit.
[13:47:35] <Jagst3r15> like var isPlaying = playing(); ? or...
[13:47:44] <robertmaxrees> is playing a method or event?
[13:48:00] <seaoftea> I'm having a problem converting a css selector to jquery ".menu-full > .menu-links div" Doesn't want to select anything in jquery, If I just use ".menu-links > div" it works fine.
[13:48:28] <taplar> so they don't belong to the menu-full element
[13:48:31] <Uhkis> those are two different selectors
[13:48:51] <robertmaxrees> also: there's no "converting" - jquery uses css selectors plus some.
[13:49:14] <seaoftea> Yeah I know, ".menu-full > .menu-links div" exists, just not when the page loads
[13:49:31] <seaoftea> Do I have to create an on.click event after it exists?
[13:49:32] <robertmaxrees> why are you selecting those elements, then?
[13:49:41] <robertmaxrees> hah - use delegation instead :)
[13:50:10] <robertmaxrees> $('.menu-full').on('click', '.menu-links > div', function (){});
[13:50:24] <robertmaxrees> https://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events and http://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/ for more info.
[13:50:36] <seaoftea> ok, thanks!
[13:52:51] <Jagst3r15> robertmaxrees playing is an event according to the docs
[13:53:09] <robertmaxrees> so playing() would be running a function.
[13:53:17] <robertmaxrees> that means you'll need to bind an event listener.
[13:53:38] <Jagst3r15> oh ok, i'll need to figure it out
[13:53:41] <robertmaxrees> var isPlaying = false; $('someThing').on('playing', function() { isPlaying = true; });
[13:53:46] <robertmaxrees> then set it to false when you stop.
[13:53:56] <robertmaxrees> why are you checking on state, btw?
[14:00:43] <taplar> he's anti-establishment.  gotta keep an eye on the state
[14:05:25] <Jagst3r15> robertmaxrees based on your code I was able to do a console.log within the .on('playing... - however, what goes in the if statement?
[14:05:31] <Jagst3r15> if (!isPlaying)?
[14:05:37] <robertmaxrees> i don't know what you mean.
[14:05:49] <robertmaxrees> can you share an example of what you're trying to do now?
[14:06:30] <Jagst3r15> I have it locally, but when someone clicks a true answer I want the slide to iterate to the next one
[14:06:34] <robertmaxrees> because the if would't go inside of that particular event handler.
[14:06:39] <Jagst3r15> it eventually ends and reloads the page when no slides are left
[14:07:44] <robertmaxrees> what does that have to do with whether or not the video is playing?
[14:08:08] <Jagst3r15> 1 sec
[14:11:00] <Jagst3r15> I think at one point I was experiencing issues but you're right it seems to work without that, my issue now is that the active-slide class is not appending to the next slide -_- sigh
[14:11:42] <Jagst3r15> when I console.log activeIndex I get a -1
[14:13:47] <Jagst3r15> if it is working the slide index should go up, remove active-slide from the current li, and then add it to the next one
[14:14:05] <robertmaxrees> i'd have to see it.
[14:24:02] <ABM_Dan> Quick question, is it faster for me to so removeAttr('disabled'); directly or check if it has the attr?
[14:24:16] <robertmaxrees> shouldn't be an issue either way
[14:24:27] <ABM_Dan> s/so/do
[14:24:27] <b-ot> Correction, <ABM_Dan> Quick question, is it faster for me to do removeAttr('disabled'); directly or check if it has the attr?
[14:24:30] <robertmaxrees> but checking first is probably faster.
[14:24:43] <robertmaxrees> but the performance difference will be negligible.
[14:24:47] <ABM_Dan> The question is, is the check done internally?
[14:24:49] <taplar> would prop setting to false be faster?
[14:25:36] <robertmaxrees> the performance difference will be negligible either way.
[14:26:14] <ABM_Dan> I haven't gotten used to using prop, the few times I tried, it ended up being too inconsistent for me.
[14:26:32] <robertmaxrees> it's just accessing the properties on the underlying DOM object.
[14:26:37] <robertmaxrees> so it's generally what you want.
[14:43:15] <Jagst3r15> do you guys know if you can use .on for custom events?
[14:43:36] <Jagst3r15> jQuery(document).on(....
[14:47:50] <taplar> yes
[14:49:47] <Jagst3r15> taplar any reason why this wouldn't work though? I don't see the console.log http://hastebin.com/kizaviceri.js

[14:54:11] <taplar> ok, i have to share this with the room, cause this is the weirdest series of texts i've ever gotten
[14:54:39] <taplar> roommate: So are you purposely keeping a bird trapped in your toilet?
[14:55:01] <taplar> roommate: I let the bird outside and flushed the toilet which stank horribly.
[14:55:06] <taplar> me: "What?"
[14:55:24] <taplar> roommate: Yeah that was what I thought.  That is a true story though and just happened.
[14:55:29] <taplar> me: "A real bird..."
[14:55:38] <taplar> to which he sends me a pic of it recovering outside
[14:55:41] <taplar> wtf?!
[14:56:44] <arc_> https://i.ytimg.com/vi/EGtOTFc6-G4/hqdefault.jpg
[14:57:12] <taplar> lol
[14:57:43] <taplar> i mean that's crazy even for arkansas, :D
[15:13:07] <seaoftea> Can you remove an event handler with the callback function of the event?
[15:13:37] <taplar> yeah, with off(event, handler)
[15:14:19] <taplar> provided it was attached with on()
[15:15:32] <seaoftea> -_- idk what i'm doing wrong
[15:17:47] <taplar> fiddle your prob yo
[15:19:20] <seaoftea> is codepen down
[15:27:11] <seaoftea> OK, here it is https://jsfiddle.net/0rcey3vo/3/
[15:28:30] <seaoftea> Line 16  does not turn the event off.  Line 17 does not remove/add classes.
[15:29:02] <seaoftea> OK, there is no .center lemme fix
[15:34:48] <taplar> and fwiw i'd use delegates for what it looks like your trying
[15:40:40] <seaoftea> https://jsfiddle.net/0rcey3vo/4/ OK now there is a center but the .off still doesn't work, nor does the class replacement.
[15:41:12] <monk3y> Folks; I completely forget my jsFiddle username: does anyone know how I can get it?  The password reset uses email address, but the emails sent back/forth don't include my username :/
[15:42:44] <monk3y> (it's been a while since I've used it so I forget it, but I need a saved Fiddle under that profile)
[15:43:47] <taplar> seaoftea: take a look at this and see if it gives you any ideas https://jsfiddle.net/0rcey3vo/5/
[15:44:23] <taplar> monk3y: i believe there is a jsfiddle room on this server. check the /list
[15:45:07] <monk3y> Yeah I did and there wasn't- .. urgh.  /list jdfiddle.  My bad.
[15:45:13] <monk3y> I found it.  Thanks.
[15:46:35] <ploop> how might I trigger a function when enter is pressed, but if and only if a certain thing is focused?
[15:48:07] <taplar> be specific, what do you mean by 'pressed'?
[15:48:26] <ploop> released, I suppose
[15:48:30] <taplar> k
[15:48:47] <taplar> bind on the element, or delegate bind on a parent of the element, on the keyup event and then check if it was the enter key
[15:49:16] <seaoftea> Thanks, taplar that does give me a better idea. I still don't get why the class replacement wasn't working in my earlier example, that was driving me nuts more than anything.
[15:49:34] <taplar> seaoftea: this approach is better as your not juggling bindings
[15:58:37] <taplar> hasta luego
[16:01:52] <seaoftea> damn he left
[16:02:01] <robertmaxrees> 'sup?
[16:03:47] <seaoftea> Can you explain why when the .full-menu has a click event handler rather than just the divs of the full-menu? If you click the edge of the menu it it returns all of the innerhtml :( https://jsfiddle.net/0rcey3vo/6/
[16:05:41] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[16:06:17] <robertmaxrees> ah, so if I click on the darker-green area it gets the all that text?
[16:06:27] <seaoftea> I meant, why is the event handler applied to the whole element, instead of just the divs
[16:06:36] <seaoftea> right
[16:07:04] <seaoftea> I'm using the right selector... at least for css
[16:07:09] <robertmaxrees> actually...
[16:07:12] <robertmaxrees> err, it's applied to a parent element, but '.menu-full > div'
[16:07:14] <robertmaxrees> that's your issue.
[16:07:48] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/0rcey3vo/7/
[16:07:51] <robertmaxrees> that's not the right selector.
[16:08:08] <robertmaxrees> .menu-full > div is actually selecting .menu-links
[16:08:35] <seaoftea> Ahh crap
[16:08:41] <seaoftea> lol
[16:08:49] <seaoftea> Time to go home
[16:08:51] <robertmaxrees> .menu-full > div > div is one fix.  or do .menu-links > div
[16:08:54] <seaoftea> thanks :D
[16:09:23] <seaoftea> I think it's time to turn the computer off for a little bit
[16:09:24] <robertmaxrees> yeah deffo.
[16:09:36] <robertmaxrees> nice break from the stuff i'm working on.
[18:32:24] <Jagst315> any idea why on line 25 (http://pastebin.com/cnTCMxg4) I am getting: jQuery(".concluding-case-video").play is not a function. (In 'jQuery(".concluding-case-video").play()', 'jQuery(".concluding-case-video").play' is undefined)
[18:32:59] <robertmaxrees> is that a jquery method or a raw DOM method?
[18:33:30] <Jagst315> so everything is working but I am trying to play the concluding video when the last case-slide is done
[18:33:40] <robertmaxrees> so notice how everywhere else it's jQuery(this).find('.question-video').get(0).play(); ?
[18:33:43] <Jagst315> it is just an html5 video thing I believe
[18:33:52] <robertmaxrees> that .get(0) is the important part.
[18:34:02] <Jagst315> but can you do jQuery('.concluding-case-video').get(0).play();
[18:34:06] <robertmaxrees> right
[18:34:14] <robertmaxrees> .get(0) retrieves the underlying DOM node.
[18:34:25] <Jagst315> oh ok (:
[18:34:28] <robertmaxrees> you can't call native DOM methods/get native DOM properties on jquery objects.
[18:34:43] <Jagst315> that works
[18:34:47] <Jagst315> oh I see
[18:34:55] <Jagst315> I am still learning so I appreciate the explanations (:
[18:34:59] <robertmaxrees> yeah definitely.
[19:20:50] <ling2> Hi in D7, does anyone know how to open a accordion panel from external link. i am just using jquery accordion code, <div class="accordion"><h3>panel title</h3><div>panel content</div></div> thx
[19:21:07] <robertmaxrees> the docs should have info on that.
[19:35:09] <robertmaxrees> ling2 http://api.jqueryui.com/accordion/#option-active
[19:36:30] <ling2> robertmaxrees: thx, i looked yesterday, i am very new about jquery, i dont know how to use this function in code :(
[19:36:49] <robertmaxrees> see where it says "Get or set the active option, after initialization:" ?
[19:37:02] <ling2> robertmaxrees: would you mind to help me to figure out. thx
[19:37:11] <robertmaxrees> ^ see my last question
[19:37:34] <ling2> robertmaxrees: yes, i see that
[19:37:39] <robertmaxrees> that's how you use it.
[19:37:47] <robertmaxrees> the "setter" example.
[19:38:32] <ling2> robertmaxrees: what is .selector class. if i use .accordion class, in my case, should .accordion to replace .selector
[19:38:56] <robertmaxrees> .selector should be whatever your selector is for the accordion you want to select.
[19:39:14] <ling2> robertmaxrees: and in the example, what is number 2 for?
[19:39:59] <robertmaxrees> "Which panel is currently open. "
[19:40:02] <robertmaxrees> the docs explain all of this
[19:40:09] <robertmaxrees> :)
[19:41:26] <ling2> robertmaxrees: but when page load, i dont want any panel open. but in another page, there is link to open one panel, i will image link like domai.com/example#panel1, something like this.
[19:41:56] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jqueryui.com/accordion/#option-collapsible
[19:42:08] <robertmaxrees> then you'll need to set this.
[19:42:16] <robertmaxrees> then on pageload, you'll need to read the window.location.hash.
[19:42:27] <robertmaxrees> if I were you, I'd start by getting the accordion working with hardcoded values.
[19:42:32] <robertmaxrees> worry about the url part later.
[19:43:21] <ling2> robertmaxrees: accordion panel works fine. now i would like to open one panel from external link in another page.
[19:43:46] <robertmaxrees> then you'd use the active option to set that.
[19:43:51] <ling2> robertmaxrees: something like this http://jsfiddle.net/VZ3T5/1/. but in D7, jquery version is only 1.4
[19:43:59] <robertmaxrees> what is "D7"?
[19:44:10] <ling2> robertmaxrees: drupal 7
[19:44:18] <robertmaxrees> so that part is entirely irrelevant.
[19:44:33] <acidjazz> thats a dice robertmaxrees
[19:44:37] <robertmaxrees> also: http://jsfiddle.net/VZ3T5/201/
[19:44:55] <robertmaxrees> with jquery 1.7
[19:45:44] <ling2> robertmaxrees: so with jquery 1.7, it has on() function, and also data-panel?
[19:45:59] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/on/
[19:46:07] <acidjazz> .com/on/ guys
[19:46:12] <robertmaxrees> "version added: 1.7"
[19:46:12] <acidjazz> get it
[19:47:26] <ling2> robertmaxrees: ok. then back to Drupal 7, if no jquery 1.7, is there anyway to achieve function like that
[19:47:32] <robertmaxrees> huh>?
[19:47:38] <robertmaxrees> you said drupal uses 1.7...
[19:48:04] <ling2> robertmaxrees: drupal 7, jquery is in 1.4 version
[19:48:10] <robertmaxrees> D:
[19:48:26] <robertmaxrees> ah i misread you earlier.
[19:49:19] <robertmaxrees> wow 1.4 is ancient.
[19:49:24] <robertmaxrees> 1.4 has a .bind()
[19:49:35] <jfive> hmm i should think that drupal (no matter what version of drupal) could be set up to use any version of jquery you like
[19:49:41] <robertmaxrees> ^
[19:49:45] <acidjazz> upgrading jquery is not an option?
[19:49:46] <robertmaxrees> try to upgrade if you can.
[19:49:55] <robertmaxrees> iirc it's a pita with drupal.
[19:50:09] <jfive> yeah but, everything is a pita with drupal ;)
[19:50:16] <robertmaxrees> heh
[19:50:19] <acidjazz> can confirm
[19:50:22] <acidjazz> will never use it again
[19:50:27] <robertmaxrees> just sayin' is all.
[19:50:50] <jfive> yeah np i know
[19:51:43] <ling2> robertmaxrees: our whole site is built with Drupal 7, and i tried to use one module jquery update which allow to use up version of jquery, but it cause something not working properly in site. so had to give up to use updated version of jquery.
[19:52:08] <robertmaxrees> 1.4 is 6 years old.
[19:52:11] <ling2> robertmaxrees: so unfortunaltey i have to figure out based on what we have :(
[19:52:14] <robertmaxrees> you're losing out on support for a lot of browsers.
[19:52:23] <robertmaxrees> i'm guessing you're using deprecated methods.
[19:53:10] <ling2> robertmaxrees: sometimes have no choice. :(
[19:53:12] <jfive> ling2: i've used drupal 7, and i was able to literally just load the version of jquery i wanted with the <script> tag, no modules required. your specific setup must be different though, i guess.
[19:53:31] <robertmaxrees> jfive there's a good chance that he's using deprecated methods.  you also need to remove the old version.
[19:53:41] <robertmaxrees> since using two versions of jquery side by side is kind of a nightmare.
[19:53:48] <jfive> true
[19:54:02] <jfive> we were creating our own custom themes in drupal 7, so maybe that's the difference here
[19:54:08] <ling2> jfive: probably, but it is to hard to chanage, as site is so large, i will never know what could affect if i change it.
[19:54:12] <robertmaxrees> yeah probably.
[19:54:31] <robertmaxrees> ling2 you'll use .bind instead of .on with a version of jquery that old.
[19:54:42] <robertmaxrees> not sure how you set the index of the accordion section to expand though.
[19:55:50] <ling2> robertmaxrees: ok, i am looking at .bind now. but i dont know what is index of accordion section to expand.
[19:56:03] <robertmaxrees> you'll have to figure that part out on your own.
[19:56:06] <robertmaxrees> it's a 0-based index.
[19:56:15] <robertmaxrees> so if you want to expand the third section, you'd use 2
[19:56:43] <ling2> robertmaxrees: ok, it seems .bind will give click function. i will figure it out. thanks
[19:57:06] <ling2> robertmaxrees: i see.
[20:16:17] <ling2> robertmaxrees: haha, got it. it just works as i want, with bind.  thx
[20:16:22] <robertmaxrees> cool.
[20:56:57] <ks> how do I load remote content into document? tried to run this code http://pastebin.ca/3585587 but getting following error "SyntaxError: Unexpected token <"
[21:00:17] <Tagor> How can I trigger on hover/focus/active in jquery?
[21:01:01] <robertmaxrees> you mean the pseudoclasses?
[21:02:07] <robertmaxrees> Tagor because you can't sadly.  pseudoclasses are apart of the CSSOM - jquery works with the DOM.
[21:02:23] <robertmaxrees> I'd use classes for whatever it is instead.
[21:03:31] <Tagor> robertmaxrees: instead of doing this in css: .test:hover, .test:focus, .test:active { background-color: red } I want something like $('.test').on('hover, focus, active', function() { $('.test').css('background-color', 'red'); } ) in jquery
[21:04:02] <robertmaxrees> yeah, those are css psuedoclasses.
[21:04:12] <robertmaxrees> you can detect mouseenter
[21:04:14] <robertmaxrees> and focus.
[21:04:38] <Tagor> robertmaxrees: does focus also cover 'active'? and how would I combine both?
[21:04:42] <robertmaxrees> the closest thing you'll get to "active" is probably "click" but why are you using jquery for this?
[21:06:09] <Tagor> robertmaxrees: cause I want to target a different element
[21:06:40] <robertmaxrees> yeah, not really doable that way.  do you have a quick fiddle?
[21:06:47] <robertmaxrees> i have to leave in a few but i could take a look.
[21:07:24] <Tagor> robertmaxrees: ok give me a sec
[21:10:21] <robertmaxrees> sorry man i gotta get.  good luck though.
[21:12:19] <Tagor> robertmaxrees: ok, hope someone else can help
[21:13:18] <Tagor> does anyone know in what I should change the .hover() to trigger on hover/focus/active? https://jsfiddle.net/zcyg2wfh/
[21:19:40] <MEGAGHZ> night coding
[21:19:42] <MEGAGHZ> what else?
[21:19:54] <MEGAGHZ> ah, beer and weed
[22:35:30] <ploop> I'm having a problem that I'm assuming is common knowledge but I can't seem to fix https://lep.pw/img/d694fd3733b19c0f.html
[22:36:28] <ploop> basically what I'm seeing is that elements generated by .append()ing another element don't seem to work with .click()
[22:37:08] <ploop> like here, $("img").click() should run a function, but it only works on the first image that was there when the page was loaded, not the new one
[22:44:58] <ploop> oh, never mind
