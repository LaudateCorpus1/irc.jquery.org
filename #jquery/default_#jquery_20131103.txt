[01:15:17] <cauffe> Hey all, anyone here good with combining jQuery with JavaScript objects?
[01:22:26] <cauffe> anyone do anything object oriented with jQuery? is it possible?
[01:24:03] <pixelpimp> of course it's possible. jquery is javascript.
[01:43:21] <cauffe> oh, why thanks you
[01:44:11] <cauffe> pixelpimp: what I want to do is move / rotate / style a div with JavaScript / jQuery
[01:44:37] <pixelpimp> okay
[01:44:55] <cauffe> then store their information, like location on screen, rotation, css ect.. into JSON
[01:45:23] <cauffe> then fetch the JSON to re-construct the divs the way the user left them when they logged out
[01:45:42] <cauffe> now i'm about 1/2 way done here
[01:46:41] <cauffe> but my main issue has been making sure that when the class /template ect... spawns the object
[01:46:49] <digitaloc> anyone know how to do reg ex?
[01:47:04] <cauffe> the object has all it's methods active i.e. is not just a un-moveable div on the screen
[01:47:11] <cauffe> digitaloc: I know some, whats up?
[01:47:26] <digitaloc> i want to combine SS# EIN #
[01:47:35] <digitaloc> with "or expression"
[01:47:38] <digitaloc> for for example
[01:48:42] <digitaloc> ^[0-9]{3}-[0-9]{2}-[0-9]{4}$
[01:48:48] <digitaloc> that's for social
[01:49:04] <cauffe> social security?
[01:49:22] <cauffe> you'd want to setup your capture groups, which it looks like you have
[01:49:23] <digitaloc> ^[0-9]{2}-[0-9]{7}$
[01:49:25] <digitaloc> EIN
[01:49:33] <cauffe> is it not working?
[01:49:42] <digitaloc> it's working but i want to combine both
[01:49:48] <digitaloc> so it's an or
[01:49:56] <digitaloc> you can either type social or ein
[01:49:57] <cauffe> digitaloc: http://rubular.com/  is a good place to work it out
[01:50:09] <cauffe> you can do if / then statements in regex
[01:50:17] <cauffe> let me find you the infos
[01:50:23] <digitaloc> ok thnx
[01:50:39] <cauffe> http://www.regular-expressions.info/conditional.html
[01:51:03] <cauffe> looks like you should be able to set up two capture groups
[01:51:10] <digitaloc> i know i can use \d also for digits
[01:51:11] <cauffe> then grab if it matches either
[01:51:24] <cauffe> I normally (\d) for my capt groups
[01:52:22] <digitaloc> my boss is a software developer, but he never wants to teach me, so i have to research everything on my own
[01:55:22] <cauffe> but pixelpimp, what is am asking somewhat is if I have JavaScript class, and it has jQuery methods in it, when my user spawns a new JS/JQ based object, will it have those methods attached to it since it was created after the jquery lib was called?
[01:59:01] <cauffe> guess there is only one way to find out right?
[01:18:11] <digitaloc> ^[0-9]{3}-[0-9]{2}-[0-9]{4}$|[0-9]{2}-[0-9]{7}$
[01:18:13] <digitaloc> :)
[01:18:41] <koller> Hey guys. I'm having a little bit of trouble getting a stopwatch to work on a simple mobile App I'm developing. Basically I have a PHP page that points back at itself a couple of times to record workout sets at the gym. Each time it points back at itself it writes the value to a MySQL database, and updates the Set Counter displayed on the page and is supposed to start a stopwatch. However, after the first time the stopwatch doesn't st
[01:18:47] <koller> Page can be found here http://tizzle.net/stronglifts/New/squat.php?weight=221&session=50f756230d87d903&day=b
[01:20:05] <koller> One thing I noticed, if I remove either the jquery-1.10.2.min.js or jquery.mobile-1.4.0-rc.1.min.js script declaration it works fine. However then the jQuery theme and style isn't applied.
[01:22:10] <digitaloc> does jquery have form validation?
[01:23:11] <koller> I don't know. I've only been messing with it for a day or so now.
[01:29:02] <digitaloc> i know with html5 all you have to do is patter="insert expression"
[01:38:42] <Tomashe> hey guys, i want to $.post(url,'{post: post} < anyway in that post i want to add all values from my input,selectbox,textarea in my page and in my url i want to get each parm by $_POST[param
[01:38:44] <Tomashe> how do i do it ?
[01:42:29] <Stephen> Tomashe: POST variables are not passed via the URL
[01:42:51] <Tomashe> maybe serialize?
[01:43:11] <Tomashe> yeah i im not talking about actual url string
[01:43:15] <Tomashe> i mean to post into the url
[01:43:44] <Stephen> Tomashe: Your question doesn't make a lot of sense, but I think you are looking for the "data" property
[01:44:20] <Stephen> basically, build an object with properties containing the values you want to pass
[01:44:54] <Stephen> then set $.post(url, { data: dataObj .... })
[01:45:01] <Tomashe> i think serialize will do the job
[01:45:04] <Tomashe> but let me check
[01:45:07] <Stephen> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.post/
[01:46:27] <Tomashe> ok thanks
[01:46:29] <Stephen> If you use serialize, you should grab the form element
[01:46:29] <Tomashe> i will check it out
[01:46:29] <Stephen> http://api.jquery.com/serialize/
[01:46:44] <Tomashe> this is what im testing right now :)
[02:23:08] <Abhijit> hi. how can I slide "set" of text paragraphs in div contineously ?
[02:25:59] <Stephen> Abhijit: Are you wanting the text to loop horizontally or vertically?
[02:26:23] <mikunos1> hi guys is this way correct to select a table with the css class dataTable? $('table.dataTable').
[02:27:46] <Stephen> mikunos1: Yes
[02:27:46] <Abhijit> Stephen, I want the paragraph to slide horizontally with a little delay. then when user mouse hover on respective paragraph title I want the loop to stop. Then when user takes away the mouse then I want the loop to continue again.
[02:28:35] <mikunos1> hi Stephen it's really weird but It doesn't select the table
[02:29:22] <Stephen> Abhijit: http://jsfiddle.net/FWWEn/
[02:29:26] <Stephen> Lots of examples there.
[02:29:55] <Stephen> mikunos1: Can you jsfiddle that for me?
[02:30:17] <Stephen> mikunos1: You could also try .$(".dataTable")
[02:30:32] <Stephen> mikunos1: er, $(".dataTable")
[02:30:51] <mikunos1> let me try
[02:31:21] <Abhijit> ok.
[02:32:49] <Stephen> Abhijit: As for pausing, just add a variable in that function's parent scope which gets changed on mousein and mouseout
[02:35:40] <mikunos1> Stephen in findle works as well
[02:35:46] <mikunos1> I am investigating
[02:37:01] <Abhijit> ok
[02:52:41] <Gues_____> what's the best way to find the height to give an element so that it exactly fills the viewport with no overflow?
[02:53:36] <sammych> right now, I get the window height, subtract the height of the previousSibling, subtract any margin/padding from body
[02:53:40] <sammych> via computedStyle
[02:56:01] <Stephen> sammych: I wrote a jquery library for just such an issue
[02:57:12] <Stephen> sammych: http://plugins.jquery.com/scrollParams/
[02:59:50] <sammych> Stephen: cheers, having a look at it now
[03:00:15] <Stephen> sammych: Here's the source https://github.com/FesterCluck/jquery.scrollParams/blob/master/jquery.scrollParams.js
[03:00:28] <sammych> been reading it already
[03:01:48] <sammych> side question, what's OR EQUALS (|=) mean?
[03:06:06] <Stephen> sammych: It's a shorthand
[03:06:29] <Stephen> a += 1 is the same as a = a + 1
[03:06:48] <Stephen> a |= 1 is the same as a = a || 1
[03:06:59] <sammych> ah, gotcha
[03:07:17] <sammych> I should've deduced that one
[03:07:46] <sammych> it also picks larger numbers?
[03:07:54] <Stephen> actually, Im wrong
[03:08:01] <Stephen> sammych: It's a compound assignment
[03:08:02] <Stephen> wierd
[03:08:34] <Stephen> var a = 1; a |= 2; console.log(a);
[03:08:41] <sammych> that's 2
[03:08:45] <Stephen> a == 3
[03:08:54] <sammych> sorry, yeah
[03:09:01] <sammych> but it doesn't do anything if it's less
[03:09:12] <sammych> or equals
[03:10:00] <Stephen> |= is a bitwise operator
[03:10:32] <Stephen> So, there is no less or equal here
[03:10:43] <sammych> yeah, it's not something I've had much practise in
[03:10:46] <Stephen> basically, 0 == false, 1 = true
[03:11:19] <Stephen> In a bitwise operation a value is written down in it;s binary format
[03:11:54] <Stephen> so 2 would be 0010
[03:12:04] <Stephen> and 1 is 0001
[03:12:38] <sammych> I'll read up on that later
[03:12:38] <Stephen> so, in a bitwise or, each bit is compared using OR
[03:12:45] <Stephen> End up with 0011
[03:12:58] <Stephen> which converts back to 3
[03:13:52] <sammych> makes sense
[03:13:58] <sammych> or rather
[03:14:01] <sammych> it all adds up
[03:14:04] <sammych> YEEEEAH
[03:14:20] <sammych> sorry, meme moment
[03:40:19] <MACscr> var mbox = $(this).closest('h2').html(); should give me value of whatever h2 is before it, so the value would be 'foo' if i had <h2>foo</h2>. Correct?
[03:41:47] <sammych> not before, itself or it's parents
[03:42:16] <MACscr> not?
[03:42:31] <MACscr> so what should i use then?
[03:42:53] <sammych> you understand what 'closest()' does?
[03:43:26] <sammych> btw, that won't work
[03:43:35] <MACscr> crap, i do now
[03:43:37] <MACscr> i read that wrong
[03:43:47] <sammych> you want prevUntil() or something to that effect
[03:49:19] <MACscr> thanks. I ended up storing the value differently that i needed. faster and simpler this way
[04:29:20] <Wehk> Love the first sentence of the wikipedia page for jQuery.
[04:29:22] <Wehk> "Not to be confused with Jake Weary."
[04:54:57] <jop008> If you have a selectbox with a large number of items the background page turns black can you change this?
[04:55:01] <jop008> jqMobile
[04:57:10] <Stephen> jqlog: The number of items in a select box has nothing to do with the select's color
[04:57:19] <Stephen> er, jop008
[04:57:31] <Stephen> jop008: You likely have overlapping css somewhere
[05:04:11] <cime> hi! is it possible not to override beforeSend set in ajaxSetup when setting beforeSend in $.ajax? I'm showing/hidding a loading animation in beforeSend/complete, but would like to do some additional things in $.ajax's beforeSend
[05:08:08] <Stephen> cime: If it's not calling the $ajaxSetup.beforeSend properly, you could always call it manually in the $.ajax.beforeSend method. right at the beginning.
[05:09:02] <Stephen> $ajaxSend.beforeSend.apply($ajaxSend, [whateverparams]);
[05:12:34] <cime> Stephen: I soulved it using $(document).on('ajaxSend', function() { //show loader }).on('ajaxComplete', function() { //hide loader }), that way I can optionally set beforeSend and complete when needed, without overriding the default behaviour
[06:10:49] <MACscr> I know this is wrong, but whats the correct way to assign a particular element to a var? im trying it like so:  var tableRow = $('tr[data-msg-id="+msgid+"]');
[06:12:30] <MACscr> here is my code. Check out line 2 in the javascript section: http://jsfiddle.net/PLDfp/1/
[06:12:34] <hugkid6> Is there a way to make an element rotate 360degrees (full circle) without needing a plugin?
[06:13:02] <hugkid6> I cant seem to find one
[06:22:06] <MACscr> nvm, var tableRow = $('tr[data-msg-id="' + msgid + '"]'); worked
[06:24:44] <krenner> [jquery-ui] i have dialog with long title and i want dialog width to be at least title size. have someone idea? :S
[06:59:07] <bja> if I have a button that toggles something and I want to change the text of the button on toggle, is it more idiomatic to have two buttons with different text and different click events and just show/hide each one along with the content, or to change the text and do a conditional off data attributes?
[07:12:48] <krenner> bja, imo you should work on one button
[07:13:24] <krenner> on which forum i can create post about "[jquery-ui] i have dialog with long title and i want dialog width to be at least title size. have someone idea? :S" ? I'm fighting with this issue for very long time

[11:30:16] <khismetix> I am getting an error,.. I am reading test.htm from local filesystem.. is there a security issue with regards to loading jquery from the web when reading the HTML file from a local file ?
[11:33:49] <winsoff> khismetix, http needs to go before //
[11:33:56] <winsoff> http:**
[11:34:00] <khismetix> ok. read somewhere else it wasn't needed
[11:34:14] <winsoff> It might not be, but that was my intuition
[11:34:21] <grafi> khismetix it isnt needed
[11:34:32] <khismetix> from this gimp http://encosia.com/3-reasons-why-you-should-let-google-host-jquery-for-you/
[11:34:35] <winsoff> Oh, I'm just stupid.
[11:34:45] <winsoff> Why put the // in front, then?
[11:34:48] <khismetix> grafi .. why mightn't it be loading ?
[11:35:00] <jedimind> winsoff: because it lets you be agnostic of the protocol
[11:35:03] <jedimind> that'll work for https and http
[11:35:05] <jedimind> without having to specify it
[11:35:12] <grafi> with the // the protocoll is infered
[11:35:13] <grafi> blabal
[11:35:15] <winsoff> Ah, I see.
[11:35:17] <grafi> what jedimind said
[11:35:18] <grafi> <.<
[11:35:32] * jedimind hugs grafi 
[11:35:35] <khismetix> solved
[11:35:44] <grafi> DONT TOUCH ME
[11:35:48] <ravenzz> khismetix if you move those stuff in a webserver it will work
[11:35:48] <grafi> :D
[11:35:49] <khismetix> ok.. yeah … I was loading test.html from filesystem and protocol was being inferred
[11:35:53] <khismetix> yep
[11:35:58] <khismetix> thx.. sorry silly me
[11:36:01] <grafi> haha
[11:36:04] <grafi> cool error
[11:36:24] <ravenzz> there is no such thing as https/http (protocol) in your local system :)
[11:36:29] <grafi> turns out winsoff wasnt that far off xD
[12:05:10] <Guest74744> hello
[12:05:18] <Guest74744> hey
[12:08:08] <esmic> hey
[12:08:52] <Guest74744> i have an idea for something but am not sure how to achieve it
[12:09:44] <pixelpimp> helps to explaian that idea
[12:10:38] <Guest74744> a blank element, the user types on window focus and it inputs the data on screen like a textarea
[12:10:58] <Guest74744> that the first step
[12:11:25] <Guest74744> 2nd) the more you type random characters change or move position
[12:12:37] <pixelpimp> so you'd need to set an event listener for keypress on the document, which then updates the list of displayed characters.  as for rearranging, that might take a bit more thought
[12:12:55] <esmic> so you have a textarea am i correct,and when that text area changes some thing happens on the page?
[12:13:15] <Guest74744> ive had a rethink
[12:13:17] <pixelpimp> i think he wants to avoid having the textarea at all, and just rely on pressing a key
[12:13:23] <Guest74744> 1) user inputs text on screen
[12:13:33] <Guest74744> 2) the type gradually changes to a new message
[12:13:41] <Guest74744> with each line return
[12:14:04] <pixelpimp> i think you should probably focus on getting input to work reliably before tackling how it affects the output
[12:14:15] <Guest74744> yeah
[12:14:23] <Guest74744> am googling atm
[12:15:59] <esmic> each line return is that when u press enter
[12:16:46] <Guest74744> yeas
[12:16:53] <Guest74744> am just trying to get learn how to append a <p>
[12:19:26] <Guest74744> ok figured out how to append :)
[12:19:47] <krenner> [jquery-ui] i have dialog with long title and i want dialog width to be at least title size. have someone idea? :S
[12:20:25] <Guest74744> ohh am getting somewhere :D
[12:27:15] <Guest74744> i am able to input text in 1 one: http://jsfiddle.net/X6dKb/
[12:27:51] <Guest74744> any further advice pls?
[12:30:59] <balance> hi
[12:32:03] <koller> Hi everyone. I was wondering if anyone could offer some advice / help on a simple web app I'm developing. It's a workout tracker for my sets at the Gym. I have a page with some form code on it that points back to itself, and using PHP inserts information into a database and updates the set counter. Part of the page is a Timer that gets started when the page loads.
[12:32:16] <koller> The problem I'm having is after the first time, the timer doesn't start. Page is located here http://tizzle.net/stronglifts/New/squat.php?weight=221&session=34e8f62f0c077037&day=b
[12:32:26] <balance> I'm going to create my first mobile app using phonegap and jquery. I'm wondering about the structure.Do you know any good articles or mvc structures/frameworks or something like that?
[12:53:29] <Guest74744> can anyone spot what am doing wrong here:         $('#start').css({'top': y + 'px'});
[12:57:22] <b3hnam> I want create a smooth scroll on my internal links so I used this code http://dpaste.com/1440265/ but I have error that "Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'top' of undefined "
[12:58:00] <b3hnam> I think Its because of jquery version ( I am using jquery_rails and I can not change the version)
[13:01:18] <joroci> Guest74744: what are you trying to do?
[13:02:14] <joroci> but anyway you don't need these {}
[13:02:36] <joroci> $('#start').css('top', y + 'px');
[13:02:45] <Guest74744> http://jsfiddle.net/X6dKb/4/
[13:02:56] <Guest74744> you type in the window
[13:03:10] <Guest74744> am trying to create basic type input
[13:03:42] <Guest74744> backspace removes characters, enter should start new line and mvoe the block of type up
[13:06:27] <joroci> you want the div to listen for keydown event and add the chars?
[13:07:08] <Guest74744> i can input the text
[13:07:24] <b3hnam> Why I have this error : "Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'top' of undefined " here is my code : http://dpaste.com/1440265/
[13:07:27] <Guest74744> i cant get the text to go on a new line after you press Return/enter
[13:08:03] <joroci> it doesn't work for me
[13:08:07] <joroci> the text input
[13:08:14] <Guest74744> click on the window
[13:08:15] <joroci> you gave me the last link?
[13:08:31] <joroci> ok
[13:09:50] <esmic> when i chose an option in a select, how can i change to a certain value in another select
[13:10:08] <joroci> change event
[13:10:21] <joroci> and Guest29506 why are you trying to reposition the div?
[13:10:34] <Guest74744> am trying to start a new line some how
[13:10:39] <Guest74744> not sure how to do it now
[13:10:45] <joroci> you can have a container div
[13:10:56] <joroci> with a div child
[13:11:12] <joroci> and every new line you will append a new div and append text to it
[13:12:00] <Guest74744> create a new div with the new text?
[13:12:05] <Guest74744> i have no idea how
[13:12:16] <joroci> sec
[13:22:35] <Gmac_> anyone know how to check when text has changed in an element?
[13:32:53] <Tomashe> hey guys there is away to check if more then on class contain same value? let say i have 10 selectbox with class .test . and i just want to check if more then 1 contain same value
[13:34:33] <joro> loop through them and check the value
[13:47:20] <Guest74744> where did he go?
[13:52:02] <joro> oh sorry
[13:52:11] <joro> Guest74744: http://jsfiddle.net/SDqPq/7/
[13:53:10] <Guest74744> thanks
[13:53:33] <Guest74744> can i just adust css position of parent for enter time enter is hit to simulate paging moving up ?
[13:55:47] <joro> hmm
[13:56:00] <joro> not sure what you want
[13:56:12] <joro> like scroll
[13:56:13] <joro> ?
[13:57:02] <Guest74744> yeah
[13:57:07] <Guest74744> like typewriter
[13:57:30] <Guest74744> on return : y  -= 20;
[13:57:30] <Guest74744>         $('#start').css({'top': y + 'px'});
[13:57:41] <joro> you can just add scroll
[13:58:13] <joro> http://jsfiddle.net/SDqPq/8/
[13:58:16] <Guest74744> user hits enter and the  container moves up, this will be the paper
[13:58:27] <joro> yea
[13:58:40] <joro> and how do you scroll it back?
[13:58:59] <Guest74744> let me show you what i mean
[13:59:28] <corysimmons> What's the best way to kill a plugin in an else statement and then re-enable it?
[13:59:38] <corysimmons> I'm trying to make it only active at certain window width
[13:59:42] <corysimmons> For responsive stuff
[14:00:03] <Guest74744> http://jsfiddle.net/SDqPq/9/
[14:00:21] <Guest74744> when you press enter i want it to orange element with text up 20px
[14:00:23] <esmic> when certain value (fx item2) how do i get selectbox2 to to change to certain value (fx size3) http://jsfiddle.net/esmica/pNwph/1/
[14:01:06] <joro> so you only want one line in the orange box?
[14:01:15] <Guest74744> no
[14:01:22] <Guest74744> image the orange box is the paper
[14:01:30] <joro> ok
[14:01:31] <Guest74744> user is the typewriter
[14:01:43] <Guest74744> i ideally want it to start lower down the page
[14:01:54] <Guest74744> and as the user hits enter, the orange/page and the text moves up
[14:02:00] <Guest74744> simulating typewriter :)
[14:02:17] <joro> so actually the orangebox will grow
[14:02:20] <Guest74744> no
[14:02:29] <joro> that's like a typewriter
[14:02:32] <Guest74744> its coming out the type writer
[14:02:32] <joro> the page is coming up
[14:02:39] <Guest74744> yeah it will be hidden behind an image
[14:02:58] <Guest74744> so i was just going to move the page up with text
[14:03:05] <Guest74744> and z-index a image over
[14:04:08] <joro> so
[14:07:10] <Guest74744> infact am now thinking of a slightly different idea
[14:07:32] <frank_o> I'm trying to remove those black bars from YouTube 4:3 thumbnails by calculating their sizes in 16:9 and then cropping off the excess height: http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/tn84E/7/
[14:07:34] <frank_o> But can anybody tell why it's just a *little* bit off?
[14:07:44] <joro> which ix?
[14:08:21] <Guest74744> the top line is where the type is written
[14:08:34] <Guest74744> so the orange move must move up 1 line to simulate
[14:09:30] <joro> what?
[14:10:57] <Guest74744> a typewriter has a head
[14:11:07] <Guest74744> it prints to the paper in the same position, the paper moves
[14:11:11] <Guest74744> up

[14:43:01] <ONLYopo> Hey guys 'n' girls. Im wondering if any of you could help me with something. Im trying to get a countdown percent loading bar for my site. So say if my website will be running within 100 days it would say 0% and 25 days left would say 75%
[14:45:04] <cauffe> can anyone here tell me why my object is returning "none" but when I run the same command from console I get the full background-image url? http://jsfiddle.net/Bw5m2/4/
[14:45:48] <ONLYopo> No one's here :/ Tried asking for help and got nothing also
[14:47:43] <sunbeam> is there a way to console.log the full link of an image background?
[14:47:46] <sunbeam> with jquery
[14:49:24] <jost> sunbeam: wouldn't console.log($('your selector for the img').css('background-image')); work?
[14:50:13] <joro> cauffe i get none for both cases
[14:51:28] <esmic> when certain value (fx item2) how do i get selectbox2 to to change to certain value (fx size3) http://jsfiddle.net/esmica/pNwph/1/
[14:51:32] <cauffe> was missing a ' joro
[14:52:52] <tw2113> jost it grabs the "url('?') part too
[14:53:08] <joro> i still get none but okk
[14:55:47] <joro> esmic
[14:55:50] <joro> what value do you want to select?
[14:55:57] <petey__> Anyone have any isotope experience?
[14:56:36] <joro> if you pick item1?
[14:56:46] <esmic> ye fx
[14:56:51] <esmic> then i get 3
[14:57:05] <esmic> other wise nothing happens
[14:57:26] <joro> fx?
[14:57:27] <esmic> *then i get size3
[14:57:36] <esmic> when item1
[14:57:46] <joro> item1=size3?
[14:57:49] <joro> item2-?
[14:57:52] <joro> item2=?
[14:58:10] <esmic> item 2 = nothing
[14:58:28] <esmic> and item 3 also
[14:58:52] <esmic> a certain value change a certain value in another select box
[14:59:09] <joro> what is the formula?
[15:00:14] <esmic> ehm
[15:00:33] <esmic> i cant work it out
[15:00:44] <esmic> onlymadethatin the fiddle
[15:00:51] <joro> yea
[15:00:59] <joro> but i don't know what to select for every item
[15:01:14] <joro> need some relation
[15:01:34] <jost> tw2113: ok, but that is easily removed using String.substring or a regex...
[15:03:45] <esmic> lets say item 2 is selected, then it activate size 3 in other select box. Otherwise nothing happens
[15:03:59] <joro> ok
[15:04:06] <esmic> or it reset to normal
[15:04:09] <tw2113> just letting people know
[15:04:10] <esmic> would be better
[15:04:40] <esmic> reset to normal when item2 is not selected anymore

[15:13:04] <frank_o> Can anyone tell why I can't get the height of these images? Width works fine though: http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/Xtrjj/2/
[15:17:34] <joro> you are getting the width because you are setting it before
[15:19:51] <frank_o> joro: But shouldn't it still manage to get the height?
[15:20:54] <frank_o> Odd, when I remove jQuery Mobile from the External Resources it seems I'm able to get the height
[15:22:03] <joro> not sure why but you can use
[15:23:15] <joro> prop('width') maybe
[15:24:40] <joro> oh it's not good
[15:25:14] <frank_o> joro: Managed to narrow it down to http://code.jquery.com/mobile/1.3.2/jquery.mobile.structure-1.3.2.css
[15:26:50] <Zak> hi. I'm using malsup's jquery ajax form plugin. When using the iframe approach, there's a suggest to wrap your response in a <textarea>. I was wondering if anybody knew if this was necessary?
[15:26:59] <joro> oh
[15:27:16] <shoky> frank_o:  change $('.item img').each(... to $('.item img').load(...
[15:27:44] <Zak> if i return json, it seems to work in IE8/IE9 (so i am guessing that this might be for an older browser?)
[15:28:48] <Zak> my concern about wrapping JSON in a <textarea> element is that if for some weird reason, there's an </textarea> in the json, it will cause a parse error. I could escape my entire json response, but i'd prefer not to do that and it's not mentioned in the documentation of jquery form plugin
[15:28:59] <shoky> frank_o: or move it into the .imagesLoaded function
[15:29:01] <frank_o> shoky: Hah, wow :)
[15:29:15] <frank_o> Pretty cool man!
[15:29:25] <frank_o> Was on my way to filing a jqMobile bug report

[15:39:15] <ruben_> Hello
[15:40:06] <ruben_> One question, I am trying to use JQuery with ajax, but what is the wayt to get only a one 200 request? now when I use it uses lot of 200 (sometimes 4, other 6 etc) but I want to limit only a 1, it is possible? thank you
[15:41:04] <shoky> wat?
[15:41:48] <ruben_> shoky: a 200 GET, so only one request
[15:41:59] <shoky> if you send only one request
[15:42:03] <shoky> you'll get only one response
[15:42:14] <shoky> a 200 or whatever your server responds with.
[15:42:38] <ruben_> shoky: yes, but using $ajax for some reason, trye to use more than one request, can I force that to only one?
[15:42:50] <shoky> call it only once
[15:43:40] <tw2113> shoky, how do i...
[15:44:08] <shoky> step 1 grab spatula
[15:44:19] <shoky> step 2 ponder
[15:44:19] <tw2113> *grabs spatula from Spatula City*
[15:44:57] <shoky> step 3 punchline
[15:45:07] <tw2113> teeheehee
[15:45:34] <shoky> you're loud for a step-2-er
[15:46:06] <shoky> ... there is no spatula
[16:01:40] <jl2753> Hi, I'm trying to do an OR statement so that if the URL matches or button is clicked on, it will do something but I can't get it to work. Can someone give me some tip/direction on how to proceed? http://dpaste.com/1440437/
[16:07:50] <Guest74744> can i get any ideas in this chan?
[16:08:36] <shoky> jl2753:  function doSomething() { ... }   if (current_url === "/about/") { doSomething(); }   $("#about_button").on('click', doSomething);
[16:09:09] <cusco> that cannot be good
[16:09:13] <cusco> relying on the url
[16:09:28] <jl2753> shocky: so I have to split it and there's no way i can just use || right?
[16:10:03] <jl2753> cusco: the reason why i was relying on the url was because I wanted there to be no page reloads (about, contact, faqs all on the same html template) despite SEO
[16:10:09] <jl2753> cusco: is there another way you'd recommend?
[16:10:19] <cusco> o.O
[16:10:20] <shoky> jl2753: if you want to know when something is clicked, you need to add an event handler. so no, you can't "just use ||"
[16:10:35] <cusco> I'msorry I would need to understand your goal, and what you already have
[16:11:23] <sunbeam> i append something to body and after that i .show()
[16:11:29] <sunbeam> any idea how come this doesnt work?
[16:11:49] <shoky> sunbeam: do you never learn?  jsfiddle, mf
[16:12:54] <jl2753> shoky: thanks!
[16:13:53] <sunbeam> shoky: this is simple, how can i show something that i just appended
[16:14:36] <shoky> css determines what is shown
[16:14:52] <sunbeam> shoky: the element is display: none, but i do .show()
[16:15:38] <shoky> and that works
[16:16:09] <sunbeam> is it possible to .show() element that is just added by .append() ?
[16:16:15] <shoky> yes
[16:16:36] <sunbeam> nvm sorry

[16:20:14] <mintyFresh> trying to read a callback from inputs.io API and do stuff after... when i visit the page using same parameters as inputs.io, everything is good... but when inputs.io requests nothing happens
[16:20:33] <mintyFresh> only difference i see is HTTP/1.1 GET vs HTTP/1.0 GET requests
[16:20:37] <mintyFresh> but same exact parameters
[16:22:14] <shoky> mintyFresh: i don't see the connection between your paste and everything you just said
[16:22:41] <mintyFresh> shoky: that code executes fine when I manually request the page and pass in the parameters
[16:22:44] <shoky> your paste looks fine..
[16:22:53] <mintyFresh> the code does not function when inputs.io requests the page...
[16:23:12] <shoky> no idea what inputs.io is, or what you're doing
[16:23:14] <mintyFresh> i see the get request in the tomcat log
[16:23:23] <mintyFresh> https://inputs.io/api#callbacks
[16:23:25] <mintyFresh> sorry
[16:23:29] <mintyFresh> should have linked that too :)
[16:25:02] <mintyFresh> once a payment is processed they GET the callback url,   on that page I want to parse out the note and execute a GET to lookup the user's account & then a PUT to add an attribute to the user's info like { buyin : ok }
[16:25:56] <mintyFresh> but the only difference between requests I see is that input.io's is done via HTTP/1.0 whereas mine is HTTP/1.1
[16:28:17] <shoky> sorry, not really getting the issue
[16:29:16] <mintyFresh> shoky: it's hard to debug, I only see the page requests being successfull in the tomcat logs
[16:29:36] <shoky> all i can say about your code is.. yeah, that's how you do ajax requests.. your data and options seem to make sense, anyways
[16:30:58] <mintyFresh> shoky: yerppp

[19:23:50] <jl2753> hey guys, so I have two boxes (red and blue that when you click, will shift down 25px. http://jsfiddle.net/jl2753/8ABUL/1/
[19:24:01] <jl2753> what i'm trying to do is make it so that only one of the boxes can be shifted down at any given time
[19:24:14] <jl2753> so if i click red, the blue would go back to starting position, and vice versa
[19:24:35] <jl2753> is there an efficient way of doing this other than to specify another line?
[19:25:38] <jl2753> meaning not having to do $('#blue').css('margin','0px'); when i click on the red box
[21:04:37] <axscode> var mob_nav =  $('nav').html(); 	mob_nav.wrap("<nav class='mobile_nav'></nav>"); <== how is  this possible it says mob_nav.wrap has no method
[21:09:42] <tw2113> i think it's because mob_nav ends up being a string variable
[21:09:46] <tw2113> as opposed to an object
