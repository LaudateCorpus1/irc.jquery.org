[00:37:18] <Northwoods> If i have a global variable -- > var uploadObj = $("#fileuploader").uploadFile({  , how can i access uploadObj inside  --> $(".recsku").on('click',function(){
[00:44:18] <Turmfalke> If it's global you can just use it
[00:48:10] <Northwoods> Turmfalke, i am not able to , it is declared inside document.ready
[00:48:44] <Turmfalke> Then it's not global
[00:49:55] <Turmfalke> uploadObj = ...
[00:50:18] <Northwoods> I did this $uploadObj = uploadObj; , and now it works
[00:50:35] <Northwoods> i can use $uplaodObj now
[00:51:39] <Turmfalke> Or you could just remove the "var" :p
[00:52:09] <Northwoods> whats wrong with var ?
[00:52:20] <Northwoods> does it make it private ?
[00:52:31] <Turmfalke> It makes it local to the function
[02:50:50] <errorous> hello. how would I better write this?
[02:50:52] <errorous> $row = $($(this).find('td')[2]);
[02:51:02] <Northwoods> Thanks Turmfalke

[07:46:17] <Coolternet3> Hello everyone
[09:48:52] <sine0> $('.balustrade-run-action a').click(function (e) {}
[09:49:00] <sine0> what does the e actually standfor/mean
[09:49:08] <sine0> is it like the $this
[09:49:34] <sine0> because for example the next line of code is this: e.preventDefault();
[09:49:58] <sine0> and that looks like a subclass/function for a elements which does the obvious, prevent default clicks, amirite
[11:08:02] <sine0> anyone around
[11:11:51] <Northwoods> yeah how are you sine0
[11:12:11] <sine0> hi mate
[11:12:52] <Northwoods> if i am not mistaken , you have been around in IRC for about a decade , if not less
[11:14:00] <sine0> <div class="run-item" data-letter="A"><div class="runs"></div><div class="runs"></div></div>
[11:14:10] <sine0> Yes Northwoods about 20 years
[11:14:24] <Northwoods> aah.... nice
[11:15:10] <sine0> how can i get a count of how many "runs" are inside of "run-item" specifying by data-letter
[11:16:14] <sine0> $(".run-item").attr('data-letter','A').something
[11:21:00] <Robdgreat> length?
[11:21:15] <Robdgreat> put length instead of something and see what happens
[11:21:53] <Robdgreat> er, no
[11:22:05] <sine0> $('.run-item[data-letter="A"]')
[11:22:17] <Robdgreat> that's better
[11:25:41] <sine0> but how do I get all the child runs within it
[11:29:28] <sine0> $('.run-item[data-letter="A"]').children('.runs').length;
[16:28:46] <sine0> when you grab an element tree with var formdata = $('.balustrade-run-holder') for example, how do you then do further processing on that object, for search .each etc
[16:31:31] <shoky> sine0: by calling jquery methods on the object. e.g.  formdata.find('.foo').remove()
[16:31:45] <sine0> shoky: ok cool, so just the same
[16:33:21] <sine0> shoky:
[16:33:30] <sine0> so take that example
[16:33:50] <sine0> formdata.each('.sub-class')
[16:34:03] <shoky> that's not how you use .each()
[16:34:20] <sine0> does it have to be built into a function
[16:34:28] <shoky> hm?
[16:34:40] <sine0> I want to itterate through it like an object
[16:34:45] <sine0> like in php/python
[16:35:01] <shoky> you can use .each to iterate
[16:35:07] <sine0> for each first array as blah: for each sub array as meh: add to json
[16:36:13] <shoky> .each is fine for that
[16:36:25] <shoky> used correctly, tho :p
[16:44:27] <visualshock> Is https://jqueryui.com/download/ not working for anyone else?
[16:48:10] <Turmfalke> Yes
[16:52:37] <visualshock> Turmfalke, thanks for checking.
[17:14:40] <sine0> what am i doing wrong guys with the second .each https://bpa.st/IGCA
[17:18:06] <sine0> its like the results of the each are not dom elements any more
[17:21:40] <sine0> ok i have used $(this) to capture the current intteration
[17:38:55] <Turmfalke> If you know you are dealing with jQuery objects, you should better use $elems.each()
[17:48:18] <sine0> Turmfalke: im still getting confused
[17:48:51] <sine0> .each is a jQuery method
[17:49:17] <sine0> .find is a jQuery method
[17:49:56] <Turmfalke> Confused about what?
[17:50:14] <sine0> var size = $(this).find('.run-qty').value();
[17:51:16] <Turmfalke> ?
[17:51:18] <sine0> oh i did val
[17:51:54] <sine0> it works
[20:54:43] <oik> I want to make users get the newest file while they are on browser is there a way to do this ?
[20:57:21] <Turmfalke> Newest file?
[20:57:37] <oik> yes like JS file and CSS after a edit
[20:58:15] <Turmfalke> What kind of edit?
[22:25:34] <CinnamonChicken> ey
