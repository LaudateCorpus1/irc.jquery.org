[02:39:06] <d3m0n> How can I use a select drop down to reference an array that contains names of other arrays and use the selected arrayname to pass through a function? http://codepen.io/jstn/pen/JWbeax?editors=1010
[02:39:11] <d3m0n> Right now it just passes as a string
[02:45:34] <Cork> d3m0n: not sure what it is you're asking...
[02:46:42] <d3m0n> Cork: Lol, yea, sorry. Did you get to see the example? Might make it more clear
[02:47:02] <Cork> i get the example but not sure what it is you want to do
[02:47:20] <Cork> hmm, or maybe i do...
[02:47:31] <d3m0n> I am trying to use the select dropdown to select an array name to be used in my function
[02:48:15] <d3m0n> Eg: lists[$(this).val()]; can be replaced with lists[fruitsArr];
[02:48:17] <pavonia> d3m0n: Can't you just make a new object that has all the arrays?
[02:49:06] <d3m0n> pavonia: That literally was just my thought as I was sitting here. I can go that route too, but I guess I am curious about my current question too
[02:50:47] <Cork> d3m0n: is this what you're trying to do? https://jsfiddle.net/k0xrw1jd/
[02:52:03] <Cork> d3m0n: a sidenote, don
[02:52:18] <Cork> *don't append in a loop, it is horrible for performance
[02:53:00] <d3m0n> Cork: Yep that's exactly it, I guess I do have to combine arrays
[02:53:29] <Cork> d3m0n: if you want the values in the dropdown to be 0 or 1 ya
[02:53:31] <pavonia> Cork: Is there a way to do that without introducing a wrapper array?
[02:53:37] <Cork> sure
[02:54:00] <Cork> https://jsfiddle.net/k0xrw1jd/1/
[02:54:40] <Cork> the important part is that you need an object to hold the arrays
[02:54:41] <pavonia> Err, wrapper *object. I meant keeping the arrays as variables as in the first example
[02:54:51] <Cork> else you can't reference the names without eval
[02:55:03] <pavonia> Ah okay
[02:55:11] <d3m0n> Got it, tyvm
[02:55:40] <pavonia> A quick search suggested window[selectVal], but that didn't seem to work
[02:55:54] <Cork> ya, that only works if the variable is defined as a page global
[02:56:07] <Cork> and in that case window replaces the object
[02:56:28] <Cork> window.fruitArray = []; window.veggieArray = [];
[02:57:16] <Cork> but that means scripts risk trampling on each other as the names becomes global to all functions
[04:45:41] <d3m0n> Anyone have an example of running an ajax call, dumping the results into an object and using that object outside of the ajax scope ?
[04:50:11] <d3m0n> (Without setting async to false)
[04:56:34] <Cork> d3m0n: the problem there is that you can't do this sync
[04:56:44] <Cork> d3m0n: the code accessing the data has to run "later"
[04:56:51] <Cork> meaning a click event or something like that
[04:56:56] <Cork> if it runs inline, you can't do it
[04:57:29] <Cork> d3m0n: if you can provide a snippet of the code you're trying to get working i might help you figure out a way to do it in an async callback way
[05:01:44] <d3m0n> Cork: It's just a part of a test case I have going on, if you don't mind a little extra js. I can send it
[05:01:59] <d3m0n> Otherwise I can try based on your suggestions
[05:02:15] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net if you want to show it
[05:02:30] <d3m0n> I've got it all one codepen right now
[05:02:35] <d3m0n> on*
[05:02:37] <Cork> if you want to try yourself first is up to you
[05:03:08] <d3m0n> Well, here, I'll show you and you can tell him if, using a select and listening to the change to make the ajax call is the right way to go - http://codepen.io/jstn/pen/GWjawa?editors=1010
[05:03:13] <Cork> ya, i just never modify codepens or jsbins from other ppl cause they lose changes all the time if more then one person edits them
[05:03:36] <d3m0n> I don't think you can change my codepen due to it being apart of my account
[05:04:21] <d3m0n> As for the code, essentially, I am trying to grab live currency conversions, then place them in an object to be used later
[05:04:42] <d3m0n> If I go with the select change event listener the call will have to be made every time the select changes and slowing it down
[05:04:44] <Cork> i can, but ya again changes sometime sticks, sometimes doesn't
[05:05:18] <Cork> hmm i don't ever see you using the currency object
[05:05:26] <Cork> making it a bit hard to tell what it is you need it for
[05:05:40] <d3m0n> The very top part i was just testing to see if the variable outside ajax would work
[05:06:24] <Cork> i would recommend returning the value $.get gives you and use .done(function(data) {}) to handle when the variable has come in
[05:06:25] <d3m0n> If and when I could do that I was going to put a check in the calcPrice function
[05:06:46] <Cork> that way you can know that the data has arrived and can still keep the code segmented
[05:07:09] <d3m0n> So I can set it in the .done function and i can use it globally ?
[05:07:16] <Cork> no
[05:07:28] <Cork> well yes, the problem isn't in "can't set it"
[05:07:38] <Cork> it is if it has been set or not when you're trying to access it
[05:08:12] <d3m0n> Right but wouldn't the .done function mke sure of that ?
[05:08:13] <Cork> and if you do $.get().done(function() { /* set variable */}) /* access variable */ it won't ever work
[05:08:19] <d3m0n> ah
[05:08:26] <Cork> cause /* access variable */ will run BEFORE /* set variable */
[05:09:41] <Cork> if you instead do return $.get().done(function() { /* set variable */ }) ; /* somewhere else returnValue.done(function() { /* access variable */ }) it will work
[05:10:00] <Cork> through at that point you can just as well use the value returned in the .done function
[05:10:07] <Cork> unless you need it more then once
[05:10:17] <Cork> (as in later change events for example)
[05:12:32] <d3m0n> I am unfamiliar with returnValue, interesting.
[05:13:42] <Cork> d3m0n: it's just a variable here
[05:14:01] <Cork> full code example would be function fetchCurrency() { return $.get(); }
[05:14:16] <Cork> fetchCurrency().done(function() { /* do stuff */ })
[05:15:07] <Cork> or var returnValue = fetchCurrency(); returnValue.done(function() {});
[05:15:47] <d3m0n> Essentially I would set the variable twice, once in the $.get then once I know the ajax call is compelete set it in the fetchCurrency?
[05:15:56] <d3m0n> So global use
[05:15:58] <d3m0n> For*&
[05:16:12] <Cork> no, not needed
[05:17:05] <d3m0n> Ah, just use the data from the $.get being called in the fetchCurrency(), then set it ?
[05:17:47] <Cork> d3m0n: https://jsfiddle.net/bmkwop4p/
[05:18:05] <Cork> the window part here is cause i prefer to make it explicit when i'm working with global variables
[05:18:49] <d3m0n> Ok! Thank you! That made it clear
[05:19:07] <Cork> d3m0n: though if you don't need it multiple times this is also a way to do it https://jsfiddle.net/bmkwop4p/1/
[05:19:33] <Cork> for some extra reference info https://jsfiddle.net/bmkwop4p/2/
[05:20:18] <Cork> but the point is you pass the deferred $.get returns around and use it to wait for when the data has come in
[05:21:13] <d3m0n> Yes, totally understand how this code is working. Thanks again Cork. I'll play around with this.
[05:53:14] <d3m0n> I do believe I got it Cork :) http://codepen.io/jstn/pen/GWjawa?editors=1010
[05:54:25] <Cork> d3m0n: ya, that is definitely an option, you will make a lot of ajax calls though
[05:54:35] <Cork> as you call it once for every calcPrice call
[05:54:54] <d3m0n> Yea :/ I tried setting global var but it wasnt having it
[05:55:05] <d3m0n> Within the fetchCurrencies
[05:55:10] <d3m0n> Outside the calcPrice
[05:55:38] <d3m0n> I also thought ajax can cache the results? Cause it seemed like it was anyway since it was fast
[05:55:39] <Cork> you could set a global in fetchCurrencies and have the dune callback wrap line 76 - 87
[05:55:59] <Cork> that way you don't bind the event handlers until the call has completed
[05:56:18] <Cork> and after that the event handlers will work cause the global exists
[05:57:39] <Cork> d3m0n: https://jsfiddle.net/bmkwop4p/3/
[05:57:44] <Cork> something like that should work
[05:58:40] <d3m0n> Even better! I'll do that then
[06:00:57] <d3m0n> I am off for the night now. Really appreciate you taking the time to help me Cork.
[06:01:04] <Cork> np
[06:09:29] <feodoran> Hi, I copied some code for AJAX from here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18334717/how-to-upload-a-file-using-an-ajax-call-in-flask
[06:09:29] <feodoran> The file upload works fine and the server app returns a JSON message. But afterwards the browser shows a new page with the actual JSON response, instead of doing "console.log('Success!');". Why could that be?
[06:10:30] <Cork> feodoran: make a jsfiddle.net with the code you're currently running
[06:15:17] <feodoran> Cork: in jsfiddle I can simulate a JSON response, but how do I combine this with an simulated file upload?
[06:15:36] <Cork> feodoran: the code doesn't have to run
[06:15:48] <Cork> i just need to be able to see what you're actually running
[06:16:22] <Cork> as far as i know you can't emulate file uploads on jsfiddle
[06:17:41] <feodoran> Cork: well I am running the code from the link I posted ... https://jsfiddle.net/casp25za/
[06:18:10] <Cork> feodoran: well similar, but not the same
[06:18:31] <Cork> feodoran: ok, check in the response header in the browsers network tag
[06:18:38] <Cork> and see if there is a location in there
[06:19:04] <Cork> feodoran: btw async: false, is pointless, that is the default (and the options is deprecated)
[06:19:23] <feodoran> "browsers network tag" ???
[06:19:51] <feodoran> ah, I think I found the network tag
[06:20:05] <Cork> opps meant network tab
[06:20:20] <feodoran> what I am looking for there?
[06:20:28] <Cork> it is called differently in different browsers so i was intentionally vague
[06:20:33] <Cork> the response headers
[06:21:15] <feodoran> request URL is correct, method is POST, status code 200, content-type "application/json"
[06:21:18] <Cork> (select the file upload line and you should get a tabbed interface, often to the right)
[06:21:39] <Cork> and in there you should find the response
[06:25:54] <feodoran> Response Headers:
[06:25:54] <feodoran> HTTP/1.0 200 OK
[06:25:54] <feodoran> Content-Type: application/json
[06:25:54] <feodoran> Content-Length: 27
[06:25:54] <feodoran> Server: Werkzeug/0.11.15 Python/2.7.10
[06:25:56] <feodoran> Date: Wed, 08 Mar 2017 11:03:18 GMT
[06:26:12] <Cork> hmm
[06:26:25] <Cork> ah
[06:27:06] <Cork> forgot that this came from so, so of course it is buggy...
[06:28:19] <Cork> feodoran: try something like this https://jsfiddle.net/casp25za/2/
[06:30:06] <feodoran> so is buggy because its old or because its just wrong?
[06:31:04] <Cork> just wrong
[06:31:17] <Cork> you should never handle submission of a form through a click event
[06:31:23] <Cork> ever
[06:33:57] <feodoran> hm...I guess different submission buttons on a single form are a bad idea as well?
[06:34:27] <Cork> feodoran: well in this case it grabs the form field and submits it all anyway
[06:34:31] <Cork> so...
[06:34:50] <feodoran> yes, but this is just the minimal example
[06:35:14] <Cork> fetching extra data for the "final" form submission is fine
[06:35:22] <Cork> but ya, it should be one form per "form" :)
[06:36:34] <feodoran> is it ok to have a subform? <form id="main" ...>  <form id="sub" ...></form> </form> ?
[06:37:51] <Cork> no
[06:38:02] <Cork> it is invalid html
[06:38:46] <Cork> feodoran: if the server doesn't handle uploading data with the files you can select the file field and do .files on it
[06:38:54] <Cork> and then post them separately
[06:39:13] <Cork> but the code your using doesn't do what you expected so it was wrong to start with
[06:41:16] <feodoran> uploading files is just a sub task of the main form. it should be somehow embedded, not before/after the main form
[06:41:36] <Cork> feodoran: can server side handle that the file comes with the rest of the form?
[06:41:45] <feodoran> yes
[06:41:52] <Cork> then what i gave you is what you want
[06:42:05] <Cork> no need for a separate button for it
[06:42:09] <feodoran> but I first want to upload the files, and then be able to select them (or not)
[06:42:20] <Cork> why?
[06:42:28] <feodoran> why not?
[06:42:36] <Cork> it means you will have to first upload the files
[06:42:46] <feodoran> yes
[06:42:49] <Cork> reload the page so the server can tell you what files are uploaded
[06:43:12] <Cork> and then you can submit the form, without the file (where you only include a ref to what files are already stored server side)
[06:43:16] <feodoran> this might reset data already entered in other fields
[06:43:28] <Cork> with this solution you will have to have a solution for cleaning up files uploaded, but never used
[06:44:25] <feodoran> what about <form> <iframe src="/fileuploadpage"> </form>?
[06:44:33] <Cork> doesn't change the fact
[06:44:47] <feodoran> which fact? invalid HTML?
[06:44:58] <Cork> wanting to upload the files with the forms, and upload the files before submitting the form can't be true at the same time
[06:45:09] <Cork> unless you want to upload the files twice
[06:45:34] <Cork> anyway afk, lunch
[06:45:58] <feodoran> well I would only upload the files before, not twice
[10:06:53] <anli_> I have a string containing a bom in js, can I decode it to a normal string?
[10:07:08] <anli_> Wow, how googlable isnt that question, sorry
[10:23:13] <Koopz> is it possible to find out the detected content type of a Datatables column?
[10:25:34] <Koopz> I SHOULD have added autodetection for times (e.g. 09:00) using moment.js but DataTables doesn't seem to be able to sort a column which should get detected
[10:27:07] <Koopz> it does seem to be able to sort my data correctly when ordering by just that one column containing the time but if i try to order the data using more than one column it doesn't do crap
[10:36:02] <Koopz> or maybe i'm just misinterpreting orderData
[10:38:25] <taplar> you might have more luck asking on their forums (i believe people have mentioned them before).  otherwise most people i see in the room only have general knowledge when it comes to DT.
[11:42:03] <blubbb> hello guys, i'm using https://jqueryui.com/sortable/#connect-lists to drag and drop elements between columns, is there a simple way to disable the option of change the position of the elements in a column?
[12:13:41] <stennowork> i have a problem with jquery - it seems that width() of an svg element is 0
[12:14:09] <stennowork> is there a jquery way to get the width of an svg element after css transforms are applied?
[12:16:19] <stennowork> i guess i just have to use boundingclientrect
[12:16:55] <stennowork> offset().top seems to work fine
[12:20:18] <snover> stennowork: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/wiki/Won't-Fix#svg-or-vml
[12:23:18] <stennowork> snover, thanks
[12:23:25] <stennowork> makes sense, come to think of it
[12:43:24] <dglambert> yo
[13:38:05] <sequel> hello
[13:48:58] <taplar> sequel: aloha
[14:01:56] <tsukasadt> Could someone recommend an easy-to-follow guide/tutorial on classes/functions? I want to make a function with "sub-functions", but I honestly have no idea what I'm doing in JavaScript/jQuery. This is what I came up with, but clearly it doesn't work: https://jsfiddle.net/f9zgjp5p/
[14:03:45] <taplar> function with sub-functions?
[14:03:52] <tsukasadt> Yeah.
[14:04:14] <tsukasadt> The example of my failed attempt should show what I'm trying to do fairly well (I think).
[14:04:59] <taplar> __construct makes me think you are trying to create a class
[14:05:53] <tsukasadt> taplar, basically the same concept. I want to call funcs.parent() and have that execute the logic, calling on children functions applicable only to it.
[14:08:10] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/f9zgjp5p/1/
[14:08:20] <taplar> though iirc ES6 has a different way of doing it
[14:08:54] <taplar> you should hit up ##javascript for questions like this
[14:11:38] <tsukasadt> I wasn't sure if there was a jQuery equivalent. :S
[14:12:01] <taplar> no, this is a language thing.  jQuery is a library for the language
[14:12:11] <tsukasadt> ty
[14:23:12] <fission6> how do i find all inputs with a name like, form-20-quantity where -*-
[14:23:28] <fission6> or evem just if name contains/ends with 'quantity' would work
[14:26:49] <taplar> i'd recommend putting a common class on them instead
[14:27:38] <taplar> otherwise there is the starts with (^=) and endswith ($=) operators you can use as part of an attribute selector
[14:29:45] <Whiskey> if i get an error in javascript
[14:29:53] <Whiskey> is there anyway to cache it and put an error massage myself?
[14:30:25] <taplar> cache = catch?
[14:30:36] <Whiskey> like if (error == "this") {do this}
[14:30:44] <Whiskey> yeh catch :D
[14:31:13] <taplar> javascript has a try catch block you can use.  it just depends on if the error is thrown or not
[14:31:42] <Whiskey> I don´t know what that means
[14:32:12] <taplar> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/try...catch
[14:32:54] <Whiskey> why the hell is all links to mozilla
[14:33:02] <Whiskey> is mozilla the ones who sets the standards :D
[14:33:15] <taplar> because it is a good resource
[14:33:29] <Whiskey> hehe :D
[14:33:30] <taplar> w3c and some other set the standards iirc
[14:33:33] <Whiskey> What about WebKit :D
[14:33:50] <taplar> idk about that really
[14:34:04] <Whiskey> WebKit is Chrome and Opera right?
[14:34:14] <Whiskey> ao i don´t talk about shit i don´t know anything about now :D
[14:34:28] <taplar> i'm sure a google would tell you that, ;)
[14:35:55] <Whiskey> ooo WebKit maybe is the CSS part
[14:35:56] <Whiskey> :D
[14:36:27] <Whiskey> Chrome V8 is the name :D
[14:36:42] <Whiskey> anyways taplar: i don´t see how to applay it really
[14:36:47] <Whiskey> const regex = new RegExp($regex.val(), flags); is the line that fail
[14:36:51] <taplar> that's their javascript engine
[14:37:06] <Whiskey> yeh its javascript in here so we still on correct track :D
[14:38:00] <taplar> so look at that mdn at their example
[14:38:22] <Whiskey> i don´t understand it
[14:38:48] <Whiskey> i think it is try {const regex = new RegExp($regex.val(), flags);} { then im lost
[14:39:04] <taplar> look at the examples
[14:41:57] <Whiskey> i think it is try {const regex = new RegExp($regex.val(), flags);} [catch <- but i still don´t get it
[14:43:27] <Whiskey> in my eyes it should be if error = somewhere but i don´t see that in the example
[14:44:13] <taplar> try { ..your code... } catch ( error ) { ...code for handling 'error'... }
[14:44:26] <Whiskey> yeh i found that on w3c it was more easy to understand
[14:44:55] <taplar> w3cschool?
[14:45:34] <Whiskey> yeh
[14:45:41] <Whiskey> https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_errors.asp
[14:45:55] <taplar> w3c !== w3cschools
[14:46:08] <Whiskey> i know :) sorry :D
[14:46:25] <taplar> and just be aware there are websites out there detailing many inaccuracies found on w3cschools.  which is why peeps link to mdn instead
[14:46:53] <Whiskey> taplar: kk
[14:47:07] <Whiskey> buy use try, no error will be thrown if i don´t do it myself right?
[14:47:12] <Whiskey> "by"
[14:47:54] <taplar> no, as long as any object is thrown a try catch can catch it
[14:48:15] <taplar> be it by you, a library method used in it, or the system
[14:48:34] <taplar> system being the js engine
[14:48:43] <Whiskey> try { ..your code... } catch ( error ) { ...code for handling 'error'... } <-- if i don´t do anything in last one no error will be throw right?
[14:49:00] <benlieb> Does anyone know of a widget that acts like a select box, but can have html content?
[14:49:24] <taplar> no, it will still be thrown, just not further out of where ever your try catch block is
[14:49:29] <taplar> if that is what you are asking
[14:49:54] <taplar> benlieb: jquery ui has something like that
[14:50:44] <taplar> http://jqueryui.com/selectmenu/
[14:50:57] <Whiskey> tapler error will contain the error that happens
[14:51:09] <taplar> specifically take a look at the custom rendering tab
[14:51:11] <Whiskey> well lets just stop and try what happens
[14:51:24] <taplar> yes
[14:52:38] <Whiskey> const regex = new RegExp($regex.val(), flags); give me "unterminated character class"
[14:52:44] <Whiskey> so i espect that to be in error variable
[14:53:16] <taplar> you get that when you console.log(error) in the catch?
[14:54:07] <Whiskey> yeh, i and alot of other crap i don´t care about
[14:54:18] <taplar> :)
[14:54:28] <Whiskey> stocktracking or whatever its calling on english
[14:54:42] <Whiskey> but i assume the first line always is the errror
[14:54:49] <taplar> stacktrace
[14:54:56] <Whiskey> :)
[14:56:20] <Whiskey> so if (error.split('\n')[0] == "") {do this} should always work i assume
[14:56:33] <Whiskey> damn thats looks uggöy
[14:56:35] <Whiskey> "uggly"
[14:57:05] <taplar> well if you get an error you know the string wasn't a valid regex.  so what's the need to check anything?
[14:58:01] <Whiskey> i try to show the error on the page insted of in the console
[14:58:36] <taplar> "Invalid Regex" isn't sufficient?
[14:59:16] <taplar> i need to google, but you could also try logging error.message
[15:00:37] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/k2b0cb8q/  ya, error.message might be what you are after
[15:01:45] <jquery790> Is there a callback for a click? like, toggling so click1 does X, click2 does Y, click 3 does X, etc etc?
[15:02:22] <jak2000> hi taplar
[15:02:25] <taplar> you can use delegates instead and swap a class in or out
[15:02:45] <taplar> or just check for the class in the click handler in an if else
[15:02:45] <taplar> evening
[15:02:52] <Whiskey> da,m
[15:02:58] <Whiskey> "damn", thanks alot taplar
[15:03:22] <taplar> that work for you?
[15:03:33] <jak2000> taplar accept a pm please
[15:04:13] <Whiskey> yeh is perfect
[15:04:18] <taplar> i'd rather you discuss your issues in here today.  i got stuff going on at work and others can also help you
[15:04:24] <tsukasadt> taplar, jtlyk, I ended up using a different setup for my "subfunctions". https://jsfiddle.net/f9zgjp5p/2/
[15:04:27] <Whiskey> i have not try yet but i can´t see any other way
[15:04:34] <tsukasadt> ty for pointing me in the right direction. )
[15:05:04] <taplar> tsukasadt: cool
[15:05:09] <jquery790> Okay, i figured I could just do it based on two classes, but wasn;t sure if there was abetter way to go about it
[15:05:50] <taplar> jak2000: i don't really do any side work.  i just hang out in here and offer advice.  not looking to do any freelancing currently
[15:06:17] <jak2000> ok..
[15:06:18] <jak2000> thanks
[15:06:23] <jak2000> escuse me
[15:06:40] <taplar> jquery790: events are pretty stateless, since the dom is stateful.  so you just use what tools you have, :)
[15:10:01] <Whiskey> taplar: don´t work as i espected my other code but the error.massage is perfect :)
[15:11:02] <taplar> awesome
[15:12:07] <Whiskey> tapler: i can show you my complete code, i don´t think it has any jQuery do
[15:12:18] <Whiskey> give me a second to post it
[15:12:47] <taplar> so what you are saying is i should have directed you to ##javascript, >:-D
[15:14:25] <Whiskey> them whare to slow :D
[15:16:44] <Whiskey> taplar: $("#result").html("<div class='error'>No matches.</div>") thats right?
[15:16:58] <Whiskey> change everything inside #result to the code given in html()
[15:17:16] <taplar> yep
[15:20:00] <Whiskey> taplar: ok i have to errors know actully
[15:20:07] <Whiskey> maybe its just one
[15:20:32] <Whiskey> http://codepen.io/Whiskey/pen/bqBywz
[15:20:47] <Whiskey> if you do "[test" in regexp the error will come
[15:21:43] <Whiskey> problem is, if you don´t do it, it will error anyways of some wierd reason
[15:22:23] <taplar> so... you are catching the error that the regex is invalid.  but you are still trying to exec the regex regardless
[15:23:06] <taplar> you wouldn't evaluate the regex if an error occurred in making it, no?
[15:23:07] <Whiskey> im not good at JS
[15:23:15] <Whiskey> yeh
[15:24:28] <Whiskey> why don´t try {} catch(err) {} else {} work it feels right
[15:24:42] <taplar> it is working
[15:25:03] <Whiskey> not for me
[15:25:27] <taplar> what's not working?
[15:26:01] <Whiskey> http://codepen.io/Whiskey/pen/bqBywz
[15:26:44] <taplar> i'm looking at that, and i explained the error you were getting.
[15:27:15] <Whiskey> I UPDATED IT
[15:27:18] <Whiskey> sorry "updated it"
[15:27:37] <Whiskey> but know the stupid codepen stop working :D
[15:28:51] <taplar> ah, i didn't know codepens updated.  i'm used to fiddles
[15:29:26] <Whiskey> tapler, i would love you use it but i don´t get it to work whit fiddle
[15:29:26] <taplar> so it looks like you are doing try {} catch {} else {}
[15:29:59] <Whiskey> https://jsfiddle.net/Slaktarn/uva7a1oy/3/
[15:30:08] <taplar> no that's cool.  i was just saying why i said what i said before about already looking at it
[15:30:25] <Whiskey> i have try to get it working in jsfiddle but it won´t run it
[15:30:53] <taplar> yeah, same issue.  try {} catch {} else {}
[15:31:03] <Whiskey> yeh but it won´t work ether way :D
[15:31:08] <taplar> hit the tidy button and look at your logic
[15:31:26] <Whiskey> https://jsfiddle.net/Slaktarn/uva7a1oy/2/ try that one
[15:31:37] <Whiskey> of some reason the javascript is not running
[15:31:57] <taplar> 'either' way?
[15:32:58] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/uva7a1oy/4/ ?
[15:34:54] <Whiskey> well css is fucked up and still don´t run :D
[15:35:30] <taplar> we can stay on codepen if you want
[15:35:37] <Whiskey> i hate it
[15:35:44] <Whiskey> but it was the only one i got to work
[15:39:43] <Whiskey> jsFiddle get "ReferenceError: _ is not defined"
[15:41:33] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/uva7a1oy/5/ ?
[15:41:43] <taplar> your import of lodash looked odd
[15:41:48] <taplar> it had view source on the front of it
[15:42:16] <Whiskey> yeh
[15:44:06] <Whiskey> there you go :D
[15:45:32] <jquery790> Me again: so I tried working with toggle for this, but after I toggle through 3-4 times, the ul begins to clone, any ideas? https://fiddle.jshell.net/evwpr4jj/1/
[15:46:07] <taplar> line 5, remove is a method
[15:46:58] <jquery790> Fixed, but now it will remove the object for good, and stop appending: https://fiddle.jshell.net/evwpr4jj/2/
[15:47:03] <Whiskey> taplar: lets see if i can fix it up
[15:47:59] <taplar> if all you're after is minimizing it, why are you removing it instead of just changing the css on it?
[15:49:10] <jquery790> I'm minimizing a div around it and creating a smaller side bar, fixed my issue by moving the remove method to the end of the function
[15:49:11] <Whiskey> taplar: so here we are now: https://jsfiddle.net/Slaktarn/uva7a1oy/7/
[15:49:14] <Whiskey> the current error i got
[15:50:09] <taplar> Whiskey: alright, so look at your console
[15:54:41] <Whiskey> yeh i know what it does but i suck at it :D
[15:55:34] <Whiskey> its the const result = regex.exec(test); that errors, why not have it in else ?
[15:55:38] <taplar> so i'll point you to it again
[15:55:38] <taplar> try {} catch {} else {}
[15:55:55] <Whiskey> yeh if error not found "else" = "do this"
[15:56:13] <Whiskey> or have i got it totaly wrong :D'
[15:56:23] <taplar> why do you think else is valid to go there?
[15:56:38] <taplar> else is paired with if
[15:57:18] <Whiskey> o i just assumed
[15:57:33] <Whiskey> how would you else do it
[15:57:36] <Whiskey> a new if?
[15:57:38] <taplar> look at the docs instead, ;)
[15:57:49] <Whiskey> if (error == "not set") {do this}
[15:58:04] <taplar> various approaches to this
[15:58:14] <taplar> you could stick all the good logic inside the try {} block
[15:58:29] <taplar> you could try doing a return; at the bottom of the catch {}
[15:58:55] <taplar> or yeah you could do an if (regexvariable) before you try to use it
[15:59:00] <taplar> whatever strikes your fancy
[15:59:11] <Whiskey> catch (error; return) { ?
[15:59:35] <taplar> catch (error) { ... stuff...; return; }
[15:59:45] <taplar> forcing it to return out of the method so nothing after it executes
[15:59:53] <snover> Whiskey: i would really recommend that you take the time to learn the basics of javascript syntax. maybe read http://eloquentjavascript.net/
[16:00:03] <Whiskey> oo it never go out aha
[16:01:02] <Whiskey> no i still don´t fallow
[16:01:06] <taplar> what do you mean never goes out?
[16:01:10] <Whiskey> its never inside {} if error not found
[16:01:21] <Whiskey> it should just work
[16:01:22] <taplar> right
[16:01:32] <taplar> if no error is found sure
[16:01:43] <taplar> provided that const inside the try {} is global to the method
[16:01:47] <taplar> i'm not familiar with const yet
[16:01:53] <taplar> scope wise
[16:02:08] * taplar looks as snover
[16:03:18] <taplar> nope, block scoped
[16:03:34] <taplar> so even in the good case, you are going to have an issue with that
[16:03:44] <taplar> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/const
[16:05:06] <Whiskey> i mean this don´t work ether https://jsfiddle.net/Slaktarn/uva7a1oy/9/
[16:05:45] <Whiskey> so the problem is the const variables
[16:06:13] <taplar> right, as i just said, they are block scoped
[16:06:23] <taplar> meaning they only exist inside the {} they are declared in
[16:06:33] <Whiskey> thats quite smart
[16:06:36] <Whiskey> to have its optional
[16:06:59] <taplar> so honestly i'd just move all the good logic up into the try and then you can remove that return
[16:07:34] <taplar> if the good logic continues to grow i'd refactor it out into it's own method
[16:07:45] <taplar> might not be a bad idea anyways
[16:08:04] <Whiskey> thanks for that
[16:08:28] <Whiskey> it works now :D
[16:11:00] <Whiskey> taplar: last problem
[16:11:22] <Whiskey> taplar: https://jsfiddle.net/Slaktarn/uva7a1oy/10/
[16:11:40] <Whiskey> how do you get it to match more then one line?
[16:12:08] <taplar> the regex?
[16:12:25] <Whiskey> yeh
[16:12:29] <Whiskey> will you see a real example
[16:12:33] <Whiskey> so you get what i mean maybe
[16:12:35] <taplar> if so that's a google question.  i think for js there's a flag you can give it to make it do that
[16:13:17] <taplar> or ask ##javascript about that
[16:14:17] <Whiskey> http://rubular.com/r/NdHWnJWVcJ like that
[16:14:40] <Whiskey> i think JS regexp support \n
[16:16:09] <Whiskey> espect that i think that site is done :D
[16:16:43] <taplar> look at the docs for RegEx.  it's probably mentioned in there
[16:16:58] <taplar> *RegExp
[16:16:58] <Whiskey> i don´t know a shit about it :D
[16:17:10] <snover> then read the docs and you will know some shit about it.
[16:17:13] <taplar> so, again, google
[16:17:28] <taplar> cause otherwise i'm going to be the one googling and reading what i read to you
[16:18:21] <Whiskey> hehe :D
[16:18:57] <Whiskey> wtf
[16:19:16] <Whiskey> shoukd not switch m work?
[16:19:37] <Whiskey> as it multiline
[16:20:14] <taplar> what does m do?
[16:21:03] <Whiskey> multilkine
[16:21:07] <Whiskey> "multiline"
[16:21:35] <taplar> no, what do the docs say the flag does
[16:22:34] <Whiskey> Perform multiline matching
[16:22:57] <taplar> that's all it says?
[16:23:07] <Whiskey> yeh
[16:23:15] <Whiskey> https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_obj_regexp.asp
[16:23:34] <taplar> mdn dude
[16:24:00] <Whiskey> it says m 	Multi-line search.
[16:25:02] <taplar> click on the 'm' to go to the details about it
[16:26:20] <Whiskey> nothing to click on :D
[16:26:32] <taplar> there is, the m is a link
[16:27:54] <Whiskey> well i have another problem :d
[16:28:07] <Whiskey> look at the end of the page, https://jsfiddle.net/Slaktarn/uva7a1oy/11/
[16:28:23] <Whiskey> match "test" or whatever you like
[16:29:05] <Whiskey> not on my page
[16:30:08] <Whiskey> the switches is undefined
[16:31:51] <taplar> the flags?
[16:32:11] <Whiskey> got it :D
[16:32:26] <taplar> where are the flags on the page?
[16:32:45] <Whiskey> maybe not, its not there but it is now
[16:32:46] <Whiskey> hmm
[16:33:40] <Whiskey> https://jsfiddle.net/Slaktarn/uva7a1oy/13/ there you go :D
[16:34:16] <Whiskey> happy that it atlest go forward :D
[16:34:30] <taplar> good deal
[16:35:29] <Whiskey> still stupid rgexp left
[16:57:10] <rockworld> does anybody here speak french?
[16:57:22] <rockworld> please pm if so
[17:31:01] <Aljone> hey guys im have some issue with jquery and prototype at same page
[17:31:09] <Aljone> i have alot of error like that element.attachEvent is not a function
[17:31:12] <Aljone> and i do have no conflict
[17:32:31] <taplar> prototype?
[17:32:56] <Aljone> yes
[17:32:58] <Aljone> its a lib
[17:33:01] <Aljone> js lib
[17:33:18] <taplar> a stand along lib, not a jquery plugin?
[17:33:25] <Aljone> no
[17:33:52] <taplar> is attachEvent a prototype method?
[17:34:43] <Aljone> im not sure its on the module
[17:35:44] <Aljone> https://paste.ee/p/2hljk
[17:37:27] <taplar> attachEvent is a non-standard IE method
[17:37:51] <taplar> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/attachEvent
[17:39:48] <Aljone> ok so what it means
[18:04:54] <klf> Hello
[18:05:24] <taplar> aloha
[18:05:39] <klf> Is there a simple way to remove the styling for :hover { ... } declared in the CSS stylesheet ?
[18:05:55] <klf> A handler is bound to the 'click' event for the these elements.
[18:06:03] <klf> The desired effect is to not apply the styles declared in the css stylesheet after the elements have been clicked.
[18:06:10] <klf> I could call off('mouseenter') and off('mouseleave'), but if there is better way, I'd like to know.
[18:06:54] <taplar> css supports the :not() option
[18:06:55] <klf> I know I am asking how to do something not in jQuery which seems silly, but "hey" I gotta try
[18:07:32] <taplar> i'm confused.
[18:13:04] <klf> Fine... I'll just use off('mouseenter') and off('mouseleave') then.
[18:13:42] <taplar> no i mean it seems like you're asking how to use jQuery to change a stylesheet.  which you don't do
[18:14:02] <taplar> instead you make your rules as such that when you change your elements in the dom the right styles are applied
[18:15:34] <klf> taplar: I think I've described what I wanted to achieve.
[18:16:00] <taplar> gl then
[18:16:21] <klf> Currently I have :hover { ... } declared in the CSS stylesheet.
[18:17:19] <taplar> right, which always applies
[18:17:33] <taplar> so adding a :not() to it can allow you to add a conditional to it that you can affect with javascript
[18:17:37] <taplar> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:not
[18:17:46] <klf> I want to remove that rule once the user clicked on the element matched by the selector ':hover'
[18:18:12] <taplar> javascript isn't intended to remove rules
[18:22:26] <klf> I am sorry, I don't know how the css .not() selector can achieve what my goal.
[18:23:39] <taplar> you can change your rule to be something like :not(.removed):hover { ... } and then for those that you want to turn that rule off for, you simply add that class to them
[18:24:07] <taplar> then the :not(.removed) evaluates to false and the rule will no longer apply for that element
[18:26:22] <klf> I see the method you are using now.  Introduce a class that to indicate a state.
[18:26:33] <taplar> yup
[18:29:32] <klf> Okay, I will google for the jQuery version of ' document.getElementById('menu').classList.toggle('open');'
[18:29:56] <klf> (jQuery version of toggle(), that is)
[18:30:05] <taplar> $('#menu').toggle('open')
[19:10:07] <klf> $("p:nth-child(2)") selects all <p> elements that are the 2nd child of their parent
[19:10:49] <klf> nvm.
[19:11:25] <klf> I was gon ask about the difference with nth-of-type(n)
[19:11:50] <klf> (I figured it out.)
[19:32:21] <phelix> I have an $('.class').on('click', function() {   and inside this I want to select a specific element and swap the class to up on first click then back to down on second click. How do I go about doing this?
[19:36:03] <phelix> nvm i got it
[19:58:23] <klf> http://codepad.org/cN2xgQuY
[19:58:35] <klf> please take a look at these 4 lines of jQuery?
[19:59:12] <klf> The error message emiited on the Console is: Uncaught TypeError: selected.css is not a function
[20:01:17] <klf> I basically want to change the CSS on the element that triggered the "click" event.
[20:13:15] <klf> https://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/
[20:14:56] <klf> I figured it out, it should be $('this').css();
[20:15:38] <klf> object reference doesn't seem to appear on the list of selectors tho (https://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/)
[21:21:07] <klf> anyone around?
