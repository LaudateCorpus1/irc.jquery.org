[00:00:24] <kevireilly> though, depending on your use case, might want to be a lil more deterministic on where you do and don't want to use the cache
[00:00:24] <Whiskey> no i can´t do that as i told kevireilly: but i may found another way
[00:00:50] <FriendlySeal> cache
[00:00:55] <FriendlySeal> u want cache all on
[00:01:06] <FriendlySeal> just not for dev
[00:01:16] <Whiskey> $("img.toggleable").attr("src","index.php?db=1&uid=3f73f54c12198320aa4f541090e5b19e&image=1#" + new Date().getTime()); <-- that works :D
[00:06:38] <kevireilly> Whiskey: Date.now(); might be another option, but what happens if you do: $("img.toggleable").attr("src","index.php?db=1&uid=3f73f54c12198320aa4f541090e5b19e&image=1&t=" + Date.now());
[00:07:31] <kevireilly> might be able to use $_GET['t'] as a timestamp to evaluate whether or not to return a cached payload
[00:09:15] <pog> good morning, I looking for a script like "Galleria" but I just like to display a fix number of small pics (to scroll through). From the pictures I like to jump to some links (not scale the pictures).
[00:10:00] <pog> I found many scripts as lightbox, but not the feature to scroll them.
[00:13:05] <Whiskey> kevireilly: as i told, i have security on the page, for what reason im not sure, i just thinked it was fun to add, so it check all $GET and if it someone thats not accepted it will ignore it
[00:13:55] <Whiskey> i have alot of class whit name "dataViewBox", if i will select all of this whit that close espect that first one, how do i do that?
[00:19:28] <Whiskey> did try whit $("#dataViewBox").not(":first").css("display", none)
[00:19:38] <Whiskey> hmm it needs a ""
[00:24:18] <Whiskey> hmm get syntax errror on that one
[00:24:20] <Whiskey> strange
[00:25:01] <Cork> Whiskey: , "none")
[00:25:07] <FriendlySeal> waht
[00:25:11] <Cork> none isn't a keyword in js
[00:26:02] <FriendlySeal> is he troling
[00:26:22] <Cork> who?
[00:27:16] <Whiskey> http://jsfiddle.net/nN5JH/ not working
[00:27:26] <Whiskey> the CSS display: none is valid
[00:27:51] <Whiskey> hmm got it
[00:27:59] <Cork> Whiskey: id not class
[00:28:14] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/nN5JH/2/
[00:29:27] <Cork> also first().nextAll() is more efficient then not(":first")
[00:29:50] <FriendlySeal> oh wow
[00:29:53] <hubabuba44> I would like to use tablesorter with using url query string parameters to filter columns, is this possible to do?
[00:29:55] <FriendlySeal> im smarter than i thot
[00:29:57] <FriendlySeal> lol
[00:30:03] <FriendlySeal> waaaaait
[00:30:13] <FriendlySeal> is this qm?
[00:30:46] <Whiskey> works inf fiddle not im my page
[00:31:08] <Whiskey> cork, for me it looks like it odes the same
[00:31:23] <Cork> Whiskey: it gives the same result yes
[00:31:29] <Cork> but with much more work to perform it
[00:34:57] <Whiskey> Cork aha ;)
[00:35:12] <Whiskey> The other code is more clean in my eyes :) But i belive you know alot more me then i do :)
[00:35:38] <Whiskey> anyways thx time to get off :)
[00:35:40] <Cork> Whiskey: basically avoid ":" selectors
[00:35:47] <Whiskey> kk :)
[00:35:59] <Cork> there area a few situations where it is useful and the cost is worth it
[00:36:04] <Cork> ex. for delegated event listeners
[00:36:05] <Whiskey> my JS is so small so i don´t think it won´t matter maybe it does on a big page :) im not sure
[00:36:41] <FriendlySeal> design it as u wish til u get stuck
[00:37:30] <Whiskey> FriendlySeal: yeh sounds good :) or not happy whit the results :)
[00:37:38] <Whiskey> bbl thx again everyone
[00:40:52] <FriendlySeal> deving on a mac is horrible
[00:40:57] <FriendlySeal> honestly
[00:41:45] <FriendlySeal> i akshuly kno a company who forces ppl to use macs
[00:43:41] <Androidnewbe> hi
[00:43:54] <Androidnewbe> I am trying to show and hide loading div on my page
[00:44:02] <fabioportieri> o/
[00:45:13] <Androidnewbe> so basically it goes like this,  user clicksk a button some jquery function is call that processes stuff for like 5 sec, just before it start i c all. show() on the div and just before the function finishes i do .hide()
[00:45:16] <Androidnewbe> but...
[00:46:08] <Androidnewbe> it seeems like the .show() does not take an effect on the div untill somwhere in the middle of processing or while the native jquery executes ?
[00:46:26] <Androidnewbe> basically there is a delay and .show() does not take an effect instantly
[00:46:43] <Androidnewbe> there is no post back or anything it's all jquery
[00:47:01] <Cork> Androidnewbe: where are you running .show() ?
[00:47:15] <Androidnewbe> to unhide the div ?
[00:47:23] <Cork> where :)
[00:47:30] <Androidnewbe> on the page
[00:47:37] <Cork> ... as where in the page are you running the command
[00:47:42] <Androidnewbe> by default it's display:none
[00:47:43] <Cork> *as in
[00:49:11] <FriendlySeal> Androidnewbe, r u tryna use onclomplete
[00:49:19] <Androidnewbe> well i tried putting it in different palces, at the beginnign of the page i include some custom jquery function that filter the table on the text entered in a text box
[00:49:26] <FriendlySeal> omfg
[00:49:29] <FriendlySeal> diff places
[00:49:39] <Androidnewbe> in that function i added a like that calls .show() on the div
[00:49:46] <Cork> Androidnewbe: what is "beginning of page"?
[00:49:46] <Androidnewbe> FriendlySeal: ?
[00:49:48] <Cork> head?
[00:49:51] <Cork> beginnig of body?
[00:49:53] <Cork> where?
[00:50:02] <Androidnewbe> let me check ?
[00:50:06] <FriendlySeal> Androidnewbe, r u using onComplete
[00:50:10] <Androidnewbe> FriendlySeal: no
[00:50:10] <FriendlySeal> call back?
[00:50:20] <Androidnewbe> no call back it's all in jquery
[00:50:23] <FriendlySeal> javascript is run
[00:50:28] <FriendlySeal> time
[00:50:45] <Cork> FriendlySeal: please use full words
[00:50:58] <FriendlySeal> its like a game
[00:51:05] <Androidnewbe> Cork: it's in head
[00:51:16] <Cork> Androidnewbe: directly in head?
[00:51:25] <FriendlySeal> lol
[00:51:31] <Cork> Androidnewbe: you need to give us specifics not just hints
[00:51:42] <Cork> or we will be going on like this for hours
[00:51:48] <FriendlySeal> Androidnewbe, he means u need to use document.ready
[00:51:59] <Cork> FriendlySeal: actually no i don't
[00:52:10] <Cork> i don't have enough info of his setup to say that yet
[00:52:21] <FriendlySeal> grab elements after u render them
[00:52:30] <Cork> it might be in an ajax call or require.js for all i know
[00:52:52] <Androidnewbe> Cork: ok i have master page and my other page in the master page i have place holder in the head element and in that place holder on the other page i include that jquery files and register the function with a table
[00:53:10] <Cork> ...
[00:53:25] <Cork> ok, take the js you have and post it in jsfiddle.net
[00:53:33] <Androidnewbe> the function is not mine so i do not know exactly how it works but i know where in it to put the .show/.hide before it does the heavy processing
[00:53:34] <Cork> doesn't look like i can ask you for the info i need
[00:53:53] <fabioportieri> Androidnewbe: less chattin, more pastin ;)
[00:54:39] <Androidnewbe> ok then maybe you can tell me if .show() should take an effect on the html instantly or might there be a case where it is delayed by some other jquery stuff ?
[00:54:48] <Androidnewbe> i can do any pasting
[00:54:52] <Cork> Androidnewbe: now is nothing special
[00:55:09] <fabioportieri> Androidnewbe: good luck getting help with no code to show
[00:55:22] <Cork> all it does is store the old display value and sets the style tags display value to one that would sow it
[00:55:37] <Cork> Androidnewbe: what matters is the selector and the context of where it runs
[00:56:10] <Cork> Androidnewbe: one thing though, setting display: none; in css isn't fully supported for jquery .show
[00:56:27] <Cork> you should normally use .hide() on domready instead
[00:56:45] <Cork> so that you can actually set a display type on the element if you want
[00:57:13] <Cork> or use classes instead (it's what i normally do)
[01:01:01] <Androidnewbe> thanks Cork
[01:01:13] <Androidnewbe> ill try to do .hide firs on doc ready
[01:01:34] <Cork> Androidnewbe: that was just a side not
[01:01:48] <Cork> Androidnewbe: if you don't you can get unintended effects
[01:01:56] <FriendlySeal> hahaha
[01:01:57] <Cork> Androidnewbe: but it should still show the element
[01:01:59] <FriendlySeal> i told u
[01:02:04] <Cork> so ya, your problem is something else
[01:02:12] <FriendlySeal> it was .ready()
[01:02:22] <Cork> FriendlySeal: he didn't say that
[01:03:54] <Androidnewbe> ok can still have dispaly:none on the div by default ?
[01:04:14] <Androidnewbe> and then call .hide on ready and show/hide later ?
[01:04:46] <FriendlySeal> betr on default
[01:04:58] <FriendlySeal> dont cal stuf unles u need to
[01:05:38] <Cork> Androidnewbe: if the target is a div and you want to make it display: table;
[01:05:51] <Cork> you can't do that if you set display: none; in the css
[01:06:13] <Cork> that is why if you use .show() you should use .hide() instead of display: none
[01:06:27] <Cork> but ya it won't fix your problem
[01:06:30] <FriendlySeal> yes use .hide
[01:06:31] <Cork> as it is something else
[01:06:37] <FriendlySeal> jesus
[01:06:45] <FriendlySeal> but only after .show
[01:06:48] <Cork> and until you give us something to go on we can't help you
[01:06:56] <Cork> FriendlySeal: uh... no
[01:07:03] <FriendlySeal> but design smart css
[01:07:12] <FriendlySeal> before u use js
[01:07:25] <Cork> ya, its better to control it in css then in js
[01:07:33] <FriendlySeal> html, css, js
[01:07:33] <FriendlySeal> etc
[01:07:44] <FriendlySeal> the render heiarchy
[01:07:57] <FriendlySeal> always dril down ur drawing
[01:08:09] <FriendlySeal> imagine its a game where everything is constantly moving
[01:09:36] <Androidnewbe> no no i want to show/hide the div with a gif that is all
[01:09:47] <Androidnewbe> while soem other funciton is processing data in a table
[01:09:55] <Cork> Androidnewbe: please share the needed code info
[01:10:00] <Androidnewbe> can't
[01:10:05] <FriendlySeal> ya i kno
[01:10:06] <Cork> then we can't really help you
[01:10:17] <FriendlySeal> u need to use callbacks
[01:10:29] <Cork> FriendlySeal: we don't know that
[01:10:37] <Cork> we don't know anything about what happens
[01:10:55] <Cork> you have a 50+% of giving the wrong suggestions with what we have now
[01:12:04] <Androidnewbe> call backs ?
[01:12:13] <FriendlySeal> yes call it back son
[01:12:17] <Androidnewbe> it's .net web page
[01:12:24] <Androidnewbe> you mean post back?
[01:12:34] <FriendlySeal> lol
[01:12:48] <Androidnewbe> :)
[01:12:57] <FriendlySeal> ok see
[01:13:03] <FriendlySeal> this is why .net is bad
[01:13:14] <FriendlySeal> it confuses ppl so bad
[01:13:34] <Androidnewbe> lol ok what is call back in this case ?
[01:14:05] <Androidnewbe> i think it's worth to add that while the function processes a table the page kind of hangs....
[01:14:05] <FriendlySeal> ok what r u trying to do
[01:14:09] <FriendlySeal> very high level
[01:14:24] <FriendlySeal> human speak
[01:14:32] <Androidnewbe> show div with image and hide once processTable function has finished
[01:14:42] <FriendlySeal> so ya
[01:14:55] <FriendlySeal> put the show() in the prosesstable callback
[01:14:58] <Androidnewbe> processTable takes few second but it also hangs the page
[01:15:00] <FriendlySeal> done
[01:15:17] <Androidnewbe> what's call back ?
[01:21:13] <Androidnewbe> but processTable it's custom function  it does not take callbacks i would have to change it
[01:21:29] <Androidnewbe> unless there is a way to attach callback to any function ?
[01:22:01] <e-tard> join ##EDM
[01:22:01] <e-tard> damn it
[01:22:02] <e-tard> lol
[01:22:42] <FriendlySeal> oh cool
[01:22:46] <FriendlySeal> leme try
[01:22:56] <FriendlySeal> oh wait u fukin idiot
[01:22:58] <FriendlySeal> its ##

[01:23:34] <FriendlySeal> register for irc ?
[01:23:52] <DHowett> Is it preferred to return false in event handlers or use event.preventDefault()?
[01:25:50] <DHowett> Ignore that question, I ought't've searched first.
[01:27:07] <skullcrasher> is there a possibility to show an object (from an json array of objects), based on an attribute of the object (the attribute is unique)
[01:27:43] <Cork> uh attribute?
[01:27:55] <Cork> are you talking about the value or the property name?
[01:28:15] <skullcrasher> the property name
[01:28:23] <skullcrasher> as the objects have an unique id
[01:28:40] <skullcrasher> oh value, sry
[01:29:26] <skullcrasher> what i could do is a foreach and set the key of the objects in the array as their attribute id
[01:29:52] <skullcrasher> but I thought of a method/way to directly go through the json and get the right objects
[01:35:55] <skullcrasher> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9627186/jquery-how-to-find-an-object-with-a-certain-property-equals-a-certain-value
[01:36:07] <skullcrasher> Cork: this looks like it's what im searching for
[01:37:47] <Cork> skullcrasher: opps sorry
[01:37:57] <Cork> got busy and missed your response
[01:38:07] <Cork> ya $.grep is one option
[01:38:08] <skullcrasher> hey np :)
[01:40:47] <FriendlySeal> jq has =
[01:40:49] <namenone> im trying to get my div's to hide an element if active, but it doesnt seem to work. can someone take a look? http://pastebin.com/cNZE8pAD
[01:41:11] <namenone> i've managed to get it to change state onclick but i cant seem to get a statement working for 'if active hide this class'
[01:41:15] <FriendlySeal> $("lol^=wtf")
[01:41:43] <FriendlySeal> $("lol^=:name")
[01:42:28] <Androidnewbe> Cork: ok i think the problem is that the processTable function makes the whole page not responsive
[01:44:30] <relix> Hey guys, I'm hoping this is the most relevant irc channel for my question
[01:45:16] <relix> Is there a lib that is able to do something like $("#prime").scaleTo({x: 100, y: 300})
[01:45:28] <relix> and uses CSS3 scale transform to get the element to the given dimensions?
[01:45:32] <Androidnewbe> maybe it's because it gif image  and something has to process it ? and resources are locked
[01:45:34] <relix> err, width: 100, height: 300
[02:00:51] <doebi> i need to be invited for #javascript?
[02:01:47] <TheJHNZ> no
[02:01:49] <TheJHNZ> identify
[02:03:24] <doebi> #javascript == ##javascript ?
[02:06:50] <Cork> doebi: ya #javascript is reserved for if mozilla wants to have a development channel
[02:07:01] <Cork> (as they are the one that have the javascript project)
[02:07:29] <Cork> the language name is ecmascipt
[02:07:50] <relix> if I want to create a jquery plugin, that keeps some state on an element, where do I "save" this state?
[02:07:52] <jordan__> Wondering if someone suggest me that how to detect closing browser.(is there any plugin/slution for that)
[02:07:53] <doebi> Cork: ah, thats why #javascript is invite-only^^
[02:08:02] <fabioportieri> what was the google language supposed to take over javascript, i can't remember?
[02:08:08] <Cork> doebi: yes
[02:08:09] <relix> fabioportieri Dart?
[02:08:18] <fabioportieri> relix: yes thank you
[02:08:24] <Cork> ya
[02:08:33] <fabioportieri> will it be true? :)
[02:08:34] <Cork> not likely going to happen though
[02:08:43] <fabioportieri> ehe maybe in 2028
[02:09:01] <Cork> especially as mozilla showed that you can get really good speed out of asm.js
[02:09:19] <Cork> (1/2 speed of native c)
[02:09:26] <DarsVaeda> not sure if this is the right channel for this, but maybe someone can help how to do this: http://pastebin.com/TbYwtXXB
[02:09:32] <fabioportieri> wow.. what's asm.js?
[02:09:54] <Cork> fabioportieri: it is a stripped down engine that is optimized for emscripten
[02:10:31] <Cork> basically it only supports what is needed to run llvm code
[02:11:20] <Cork> but it put questionmarks around the need for both dart and NaCi
[02:11:33] <fabioportieri> oh, got some reading to do i guess
[02:11:55] <Cork> especially as it is backwards compatible with normal js
[02:12:10] <Cork> while dart needs to be compiled to js if you want to support none dart browsers
[02:12:34] <Cork> fabioportieri: there is a few big games ported to asm.js
[02:14:27] <relix> asm.js + webgl = impressive
[02:16:18] <Cork> asm.js + webgl + emscriptem = opencl program/game support on the web
[02:17:12] <Cork> bah the site that announced the games has been shutdown :/
[02:17:17] <VectorX> if i got <input><input>  and the first is this, how do i get the next ?
[02:17:22] <Cork> but unreal was one of them
[02:17:32] <Cork> VectorX: .next()
[02:17:38] <Cork> $(this).next()
[02:18:19] <VectorX> just incase something comes inbetween is there a way to be a bit more specific
[02:18:31] <VectorX> its a checjbox
[02:18:35] <Cork> nextAll('input').first()
[02:19:08] <fabioportieri> unreal the fps?
[02:19:20] <Cork> the engine
[02:19:29] <Cork> but ya
[02:19:32] <fabioportieri> ah yes
[02:20:08] <Cork> http://www.unrealengine.com/html5_faq/
[02:20:14] <Cork> the best i can still find around
[02:20:37] <Cork> http://www.unrealengine.com/html5/
[02:22:07] <gpp> I understand jQ 1 (1.11.0) is needed for IE8 compatibility. jQ UI 1.10.4 is OK for IE8 ?
[02:22:27] <Cork> gpp: < 2.0 is ok
[02:22:56] <Cork> and 2.x is the same thing as 1.9+ just with the lagacy code removed
[02:23:01] <gpp> So this is true for both jQ and jQ UI?
[02:23:12] <Cork> oh wait ah
[02:23:16] <Cork> missed the ui part
[02:23:38] <Cork> you need to use an ui compatible with the jquery version you use
[02:23:50] <Cork> the api 2.0 and 1.9+ exposes is the same
[02:23:56] <Cork> so it doesn't matter for ui
[02:24:45] <gpp> UI 1.9.2 says "Legacy" and UI 1.10.4 "Stable". So the "Legacy" is not something needed for IE8?
[02:24:54] <Cork> no
[02:25:32] <gpp> Good. So for best compatibility I will use jQ 1.11.0 + jQ UI 1.10.4.
[02:48:15] <Androidnewbe> hi
[02:49:48] <Androidnewbe> if i have a function that runs when i click a button, and i the function i do somethinng like div.show(), loop for 5 sec then the div shows only after the loop has finished is this normal ?
[02:50:17] <Androidnewbe> why doe div not appeary before the loop starts ?
[02:51:31] <fabioportieri> who knows!
[02:52:22] <Cork> you might get an answer from a fortun-teller or something
[02:52:36] <Cork> or someone who is psychic and can read your mind
[02:53:01] <fabioportieri> i know that guy ^ unfortunately is not on irc right now
[02:53:02] <Cork> but i don't think you can get much help here; we are mostly just normal humans and need to see the problem to help with it
[02:54:04] <VectorX> Cork any idea why alert(cat); would be undefined http://jsfiddle.net/L4HHL/5/
[02:54:15] <Androidnewbe> Cork are you talkin to me ?
[02:54:21] <JovanJ> Does any one knows how I can make dialogbox to opens near button where I clicked? Not on some other position.
[02:54:30] <Cork> Androidnewbe: yes
[02:55:05] <VectorX> click on either top 2 checkboxes for it to show up
[02:55:15] <Cork> VectorX: $(this).nextAll("input:checkbox[name='decat[" + domain_name + "']").length is?
[02:55:18] <Androidnewbe>  document.getElementById('loadingDiv').style.display = 'block';  for (var i = 0; i < 20000000; i++) {i++;} this will not show the div untill loop has finished why ?
[02:55:29] <Cork> hmm or i could just check my self >_<
[02:55:30] <Cork> one min
[02:55:44] <VectorX> 0
[02:55:56] <VectorX> obviously that is a problem, im not sure whats wrong though
[02:56:18] <Androidnewbe> i thought the div will show before the loop starts or what is the order of everything on the page in this case ?
[02:57:13] <Androidnewbe> Cork ? so
[02:57:19] <Cork> VectorX: domainsregperiod != decat
[02:57:44] <Cork> VectorX: and it is the only thing that is sibling to the checkbox
[02:57:59] <VectorX> oh fk
[02:58:43] <Cork> VectorX: you need to do something like closest('tr').find("input[name='decat[" + domain_name + "]'")
[02:58:52] <Cork> VectorX: also skip the :checkbox check
[02:59:06] <Cork> it only slows things down and isn't needed as you check on name anyway
[02:59:31] <Cork> VectorX: also you might want to use delegated event listeners
[03:00:03] <VectorX> yeah i noticed the checkbox issue, well there may or may not be a td/tr so just trying to find the relavent decat input item
[03:00:05] <Androidnewbe> Cork what about me i posted simple code above
[03:00:07] <seutje> Androidnewbe: I believe the vm tries to group visual changes so it can minimize repaint operations
[03:00:32] <seutje> u can force a repaint before the loop by requesting values related to the visual representation
[03:00:38] <Androidnewbe> seutje: group visual changes ?
[03:00:55] <Cork> VectorX: something like this http://jsfiddle.net/L4HHL/6/
[03:01:06] <seutje> yeah, if u make the same div bigger, smaller and bigger again, it won't update it 3 times (in most cases)
[03:01:14] <Androidnewbe> seutje btw who would i actually form a question regarding this issue to find in google ?
[03:01:22] <Cork> *http://jsfiddle.net/L4HHL/7/
[03:01:37] <seutje> Androidnewbe: one of the developer relations guys
[03:03:10] <Cork> VectorX: and even better http://jsfiddle.net/L4HHL/8/
[03:03:16] <VectorX> hehe
[03:03:28] <Cork> this one actually works ^^'
[03:03:42] <Androidnewbe> seutje: can you provide some links to relatd articles, i find it hard to follow
[03:04:05] <seutje> tbh, it's hard to find articles on it
[03:05:07] <Androidnewbe> seutje: so basically if i have some have javascript function that takes 10 sec and i want to show loading div before the function starts it basically not possible ?
[03:06:09] <seutje> sure there is, like I said, there's ways to force it by requesting a value relating to it
[03:06:17] <Androidnewbe> how ?
[03:06:36] <Androidnewbe> does this problem have some common name ?#
[03:07:01] <seutje> foo.style.display = 'none; foo.offsetHeight; foo.style.display ='block'; is one you see often
[03:07:07] <seutje> `g how to force redraw
[03:07:09] <b-ot> seutje: css - How can I force WebKit to redraw/repaint to propagate style ... → http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3485365/how-can-i-force-webkit-to-redraw-repaint-to-propagate-style-changes
[03:07:46] <seutje> find more articles on how to avoid it though :P
[03:08:49] <seutje> damnit, saw this pretty good presentation about chorme's rendering stack, but can't find it
[03:08:52] <VectorX> Cork if you got a sec/ i made a small update to the html, here are the rules, only either DE1 or DE2 can be selected from the two, also if DE1 is selected anything that has DE2+ cannot be selected if they are checked DE1 should be uncheked, there can be many DE3's
[03:09:03] <VectorX> sorry if it sounds like a school project
[03:09:45] <Cork> VectorX: sounds like you have to loop over what checkboxes is checked
[03:09:53] <Cork> and update states based on that
[03:10:59] <VectorX> thats what i was getting, var cat  for
[03:11:01] <Androidnewbe> seutje: thansk, lol this is really hacky
[03:11:05] <Androidnewbe> ill try it
[03:11:19] <VectorX> so i can make the checks based on that, but wanted to know if you had a better idea to do this
[03:12:36] <VectorX> also would be better if i can just effect the checkboxes that only have the .de extendion with the click event
[03:12:52] <VectorX> it doenst need to be there for the .com .org etc
[03:14:30] <Androidnewbe> seutje: lol it does work on chrome but not in ie
[03:16:28] <seutje> Androidnewbe: weird, IE is easier to force repaints on
[03:16:36] <seutje> I've done it by going el.id = el.id; o.O
[03:21:03] <joroci> hey
[03:21:39] <Dbugger> Hi everyone
[03:21:42] <VectorX> Cork i got it to only effect the boxes ending with balue .de http://jsfiddle.net/L4HHL/11/
[03:22:00] <joroci> when i get the height of an element in IE the height doesn't include the borders and in chrome/firefox it does, is there a way to tell it to ignore or not to ignore the border?
[03:23:07] <Dbugger> Im having a problem. I make an .ajax() call to an HTML page, and I want to extract the <title>, certain <div> and a <script>. The problem is that in the callback, I cant successfully wrap the "data" response with jQuery. Aparently you can do that with an <html> object. What could I do?
[03:23:10] <seutje> Androidnewbe: if there's a way to spin off your loop asynchronously, it should also fix the issue, as the thread is free to do whatever
[03:29:36] <Androidnewbe> seutje: yeah ill  try few thing, but i actually happy that this a common problem and not just me going crazy, thanks man
[03:52:57] <quattr8> is there a plugin to make the whole viewport scroll/dragable by clicking? So not just drag an element but the whole page
[04:23:07] <anli> Are there a lot of kendoui users?
[04:28:25] <lianzinho> guys, could you help me to solve this problem? http://jsfiddle.net/9K98c/
[04:28:36] <lianzinho> I don't know why the second one does not work!
[04:30:04] <seutje> lianzinho: it's not in the DOM
[04:30:14] <seutje> doSomething doesn't tell me if it matters
[04:30:31] <lianzinho> seutje: but my problem is
[04:30:33] <seutje> if it reports the height, it won't work without it being in the DOM, for instance
[04:30:56] <lianzinho> but in the second example, won't it be created?
[04:31:06] <seutje> yeah, but not in the DOM
[04:31:20] <lianzinho> how can I put it in the DOM programatically ?
[04:31:51] <lianzinho> the problem is that another script is interfering with it if it in the DOM before the moment I need it, so I want to create it in the right moment
[04:32:04] <seutje> .appendTo(document.body)
[04:32:38] <seutje> perhaps the problem lies in the script interfering
[04:33:24] <lianzinho> seutje: no, the script just shows all the child of the parent element, but I don't want this one to show...
[04:33:33] <lianzinho> I will try your solution
[04:33:35] <seutje> "show"?
[04:33:59] <lianzinho> seutje: yes, the interference has to do with show/hide stuff
[04:34:00] <seutje> if you just plonk em in the DOM, they should be shown already unless CSS says it shouldn't
[04:35:01] <lianzinho> seutje: yes, but if it is in the right moment, no problem, it will show but will behave as I want… the problem is it showing before
[04:35:06] <cinatic> hi
[04:35:24] <cinatic> just noticed that the jsonp automcomplete demo doesn't work anymore due to changes from geonames.org
[04:35:25] <cinatic> http://jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#remote-jsonp
[04:35:58] <seutje> lianzinho: maybe you should be handling visualisation with javascript?
[04:36:02] <seutje> shouldn't*
[04:36:24] <lianzinho> seutje: worked...
[04:36:59] <lianzinho> seutje: its a pagination plugin, a lot of stuff going on… hehehe. But it worked, no problem
[04:37:00] <lianzinho> thanks!
[04:37:02] <seutje> I always try to have javascript do no more than toggle a class
[04:37:06] <lianzinho> the appendTo solved
[04:37:15] <seutje> and have CSS act upon the presence of said class
[04:37:43] <fabioportieri> js as the controller, css as the view, html as the model!
[04:37:57] <seutje> that way, I can leave the optimisations to the ppl building the browser :P
[04:38:37] <lianzinho> seutje: the pagination is kinda complex problems, I would have to deal with a lot of php stuff and more… so I just used a plugin, modified for some of my needs and worked
[04:50:19] <joroci> anyone know the internet explorer ui responsiveness tool?
[04:50:45] <Linkeh> hey guys, i know you can bind("cut copy paste drop") && e.preventDefault() to stop copy & paste etc, but is there a way to disable the preventDefault() ?
[04:51:47] <seutje> u can bind('cut copy paste drop')?
[04:52:24] <Linkeh> $('body').bind("cut copy paste drop", function(){});
[04:52:45] <seutje> yes, thank you, that was the part that was unclear -_-
[04:52:53] <Linkeh> sigh
[04:52:57] <Linkeh> nvm think i can use unbind()
[04:52:58] <Linkeh> ty
[04:54:27] <seutje> oh, u wanted to get rid of the handler
[04:54:42] <seutje> usually better to set a condition and check for it instead of attaching/detaching
[04:55:08] <seutje> be it a scoped variable, data object or just a class on the element
[05:37:09] <rosieres> can someone help me out with a css riddle ? http://jsfiddle.net/8Ed5Q/4/ I want to have the border semi transparent like here (http://i.imgur.com/lklFWEK.png) , but as soon as I take the rgba the background shines through
[05:38:36] <lite> Just found this in our production code while hunting for leaks : https://gist.github.com/anonymous/24aaddca2bccbe130bd7 - something about the way this event is handled seems off to me. Am i wrong?
[05:41:14] <seutje> rosieres: use a box-shadow
[05:42:06] <seutje> rosieres: http://jsfiddle.net/8Ed5Q/6/
[05:42:15] <rosieres> seutje: box shadow has a bad look with that radius
[05:42:37] <seutje> is that a fact?
[05:43:06] <rosieres> jep
[05:44:13] <seutje> guess u'll have to add a wrapper then, or go all pseudo on it
[05:49:39] <ShawnRisk> Should I be using offsetTop or offset().top and window.pageYOffset or window.offsetY?

[06:49:10] <Whiskey> can i donwload the text in it and show in some element whit jQuery?
[06:49:36] <john__> Anyone...........................?
[06:51:35] <friedbyte> Thanks Cork
[06:51:55] <Cork> friedbyte: so ya, the media query doesn't work on chrome
[06:52:13] <Cork> not sure why though...
[06:52:38] <Whiskey> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/Kg7eA/20/ thats how i get it
[06:53:15] <friedbyte> Cork: not it does http://jsfiddle.net/2cCLF/2/
[06:53:21] <friedbyte> now*
[06:53:54] <Whiskey> im not sure when its a force download, how that works
[06:53:54] <Cork> not here
[06:54:12] <Cork> oh, btw your media query is invalid
[06:54:17] <Cork> you don't close he query
[06:55:10] <Ziberius> hellou

[06:55:37] <Ziberius> I can get the whole tbody transparent
[06:55:46] <friedbyte> fixed
[06:55:49] <Ziberius> but when trying it on a single row it does not work
[06:57:15] <Cork> john__: you normally can't do ajax call cross domains
[06:58:08] <nicetry> Hey guys - gotta what turns out to be a really hard javascript problem - determining visibility of an element inside a scrolling parent element with overflow:auto set. I have a test case set up but I can't get it 100% http://bootply.com/111137
[06:58:09] <john__> Is there a way i can do this in jquery,even if in theory
[06:58:38] <Cork> Whiskey: modern browsers support download attributes on the link
[06:59:05] <Whiskey> yeh but i need to dowload the data from the link. then insert it inside <div></div>
[06:59:07] <Cork> ?g mdn download attribute
[06:59:09] <b-ot> Cork: <a> - HTML | MDN → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/a
[06:59:21] <Cork> Whiskey: download it from where?
[06:59:27] <Whiskey> from myself
[06:59:32] <Cork> you have the blob
[06:59:34] <Cork> just read from it
[06:59:57] <Whiskey> not working whit link like $("img.toggleable").attr("src","index.php?db='.$_GET['db'].'&uid='.$_GET['uid'].'&image=1#" + Date.now())
[07:00:10] <Whiskey> the link is almost the same
[07:00:38] <Cork> what does that have to do with the blob?
[07:00:43] <Cork> wait
[07:00:57] <Cork> you want to use the text file data in a get call?
[07:01:23] <Whiskey> yeh
[07:01:25] <Whiskey> something like that
[07:01:28] <nicetry> Does anyone know how to determine the visibility of an element when its parent is a scrolling area with overflow:auto?
[07:01:31] <Cork> how big is the file?
[07:01:36] <Cork> (byte)
[07:01:39] <Whiskey> no clue
[07:01:49] <Whiskey> but its never over 10KiB
[07:01:56] <Cork> ...
[07:01:59] <Whiskey> normally its like 1KiB/2KiB around that
[07:02:03] <Cork> then you want to send it as post not get
[07:02:16] <Cork> get has a quite limited size as it is actually sent in the url
[07:02:54] <Cork> and you have to encode it and things like that
[07:03:19] <Whiskey> could you hhelp me whit a samle?
[07:03:23] <Whiskey> "sample"
[07:03:42] <Cork> i would prob go with formData
[07:03:46] <Cork> and append the file to it
[07:03:50] <Cork> and just upload it
[07:03:55] <Cork> ?mdn FormData
[07:03:57] <b-ot> Cork: FormData - Web API Interfaces | MDN - Mozilla Developer Network → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FormData
[07:06:40] <Whiskey> http://jsfiddle.net/Kg7eA/21/ Cork, here that link in the div
[07:06:46] <Whiskey> whit the text that are in that file
[07:07:18] <Cork> Whiskey: you will have to read up on the page i linked
[07:07:26] <Cork> i don't have the time to write the code for you
[07:08:03] <Whiskey> i don´t really understand anything from it
[07:08:28] <Cork> Whiskey: well you have a filepicker right?
[07:08:35] <Cork> as that is the only way to access local system
[07:08:41] <Cork> from the input you can grab files
[07:08:46] <Cork> and then just append it to FormData
[07:08:54] <Cork> and you can send it through $.post
[07:08:58] <Cork> hmm
[07:09:02] <Cork> no you need to use $.ajax
[07:09:35] <Whiskey> sounds complicated
[07:10:03] <Cork> well you could go with a classic form
[07:10:08] <Cork> and just do a normal full page post
[07:10:16] <Cork> then the browser will solve all for you
[07:10:35] <Whiskey> do we talk about php variable from?
[07:10:41] <Whiskey> well $post
[07:10:46] <TheEternalAbyss> funny you guys are talking about forms and inputs... I had a kind of noobish question.. if I have a form, I shoul dbe able ot just do say... <form action="submit($('#id_of_input_field').val())" > right?
[07:11:11] <TheEternalAbyss> or am I way off base on that one
[07:11:17] <Cork> Whiskey: <form action="post">
[07:11:33] <Whiskey> Cork, give me a second
[07:11:58] <Cork> TheEternalAbyss: depends what submit is meant to be
[07:12:07] <Cork> but i'm leaning towards no
[07:12:38] <TheEternalAbyss> just a function/ajax call which actually then calls a .php file through an ajax call
[07:12:56] <TheEternalAbyss> i mean js function*
[07:13:11] <Cork> TheEternalAbyss: well no action is for the form action
[07:13:20] <Cork> TheEternalAbyss: you want to use the submit event
[07:13:29] <Cork> (also add the events in js not inline in the html)
[07:14:03] <Whiskey> index.php?db=1&uid=25e8b11c059d41a5634b80d585a7e155&dl=txt&all=0&filename=this.txt <-- that the link
[07:14:04] <TheEternalAbyss> I tried that and nothing seemed to happen. Maybe I didn't type it out. I'll look at the jquery docs on that
[07:14:18] <TheEternalAbyss> thanks.. I'm sure I'll be back with questions again lol :P
[07:14:35] <TheEternalAbyss> type it out correctly*
[07:14:44] <Cork> TheEternalAbyss: so <form id="form1" action="/something.php" method="post"> js> $('#form1').submit(function() { $.post(this.action, $(this).serialize()); })
[07:14:46] <b-ot> Cork: No output.
[07:15:01] <Whiskey> anyways im off again, im not sure if you get me Cork, but i look at that form post when im back
[07:15:02] <Whiskey> thx
[07:15:05] <Cork> that is basically the smallest post ajax script you can have
[07:15:24] <TheEternalAbyss> cool thanks Cork
[07:17:04] <TheEternalAbyss> sorry, just want to understand, what does the .serialize do?
[07:17:47] <fabioportieri> TheEternalAbyss: what does the docs says?
[07:18:51] <TheEternalAbyss> k, I'll read up on it
[07:23:42] <Elirips> Hello. I'm getting something wrong with selectors, trigger and on: I thought if I register a handler using $("#someId").on("SomeEvent" .. ); this will only be called from triggers that trigger on $("#someId").trigger("SomeId"). But triggering something on '$("#id1")' will also execute the handler registered on $("#id2"). what am I getting wrong? I prepared a little fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/egerber/zJEq7/57/
[07:25:10] <Elirips> In the fiddle the handlers are only registered on 'd1', but also hidding d2 (which triggers on d2 the hidden / shown event) will fire the handlers registered on d1. Why?
[07:29:06] <melling> Elirips: i'm using chrome and i only get alert messages from your event handlers when i click the d1* buttons, not d2. which browser are you using?
[07:31:07] <Elirips> melling: yes, but why also if I click the d1_2 button? I would expect it to only fire on the d1 button
[07:31:31] <Elirips> are those handlers inherited from d1 to d1_2 and d1_3 ?
[07:32:18] <Elirips> (I'm also using chrome)
[07:32:56] <melling> oh, i thought you meant d2 not d1_2
[07:33:17] <airdem> have 3 inputs with different name="" attributes. is there quick selector for all of them?`smth like $('input[name="a|b|c"]')
[07:33:28] <Elirips> no, I thought because I register it on d1 and fire it on d1_2 that the handler of d1 would not get called
[07:35:34] <melling> Elirips: the event bubbles up to it's parents
[07:35:46] <melling> Elirips: http://api.jquery.com/event.stoppropagation/
[07:36:40] <Elirips> melling: thank you!
[07:41:16] <Elirips> melling: but then I would need to attach handlers to all divs, just to tell them to stop propagating upwards.. .not so nice.. okay, seems I need to examine the source inside the event
[07:44:03] <melling> Elirips: you could do something like $('#d1 div').on('Shown', function(e) { e.stopPropagation(); });
[07:44:17] <melling> Elirips: this will capture the event on all the child elements of #d1
[07:44:33] <melling> Elirips: and then prevent it bubbling up to it's parent
[07:45:11] <melling> Elirips: i've forked your fiddle here, it's just above your Shown and Hidden handlers http://jsfiddle.net/MTw33/
[07:51:32] <Elirips> melling: interesting, thank you. I need to do some more reading about how events bubble
[07:53:29] <Elirips> I think I will rather go with something to examine event.target
[07:54:19] <airdem> .append(dmy.wrap('<td/>')); the reulting html has no <td> wrapped around. what did i do wrong?
[08:01:15] <airdem> var foo = $('<input>'); foo.wrap('<td/>'); is not working. what am i doing wrong here?
[08:02:58] <decx> you're just making objects without adding them anywhere airdem
[08:03:15] <VectorX> each checkbox input has a appropriate /<input type="hidden" class="decat"/  item that goes with it below that, on submit how can i set the value of those to ""(nothing) if it is not checked   http://jsfiddle.net/L4HHL/14/
[08:03:17] <airdem> i am adding them somewhere later of course
[08:03:22] <airdem> but the result is not wrapped
[08:03:25] <Es0teric> does anyone know how to remove duplicates in an array of objects?
[08:03:31] <decx> the wrap td is not part of foo
[08:03:37] <decx> foo is still inside the td
[08:03:38] <Es0teric> $.unique() doesnt seem to be doing it
[08:05:20] <airdem> decx, even if i do foo = foo.wrap(...); its not working
[08:05:23] <airdem> or what did you mean?
[08:05:39] <decx> hm
[08:05:40] <airdem> Es0teric, paste your array of object. may help
[08:05:43] <decx> fiddle plz ^^
[08:06:02] <airdem> :)
[08:07:19] <DeafGoose> Hi All, I have the following html table: http://pastebin.com/hRQFWy0N , Im using this selector to pick the <tr> elements desired: http://pastebin.com/EDx36yWK however its picking up all <tr> and I would like to pick only the ones where the checkbox input is set to "checked"
[08:07:32] <Es0teric> airdem -> http://pastie.org/private/oiicmy16dgjz8y2emmnkww
[08:08:16] <airdem> Es0teric, Description: Sorts an array of DOM elements, in place, with the duplicates removed. Note that this only works on arrays of DOM elements, not strings or numbers.
[08:08:31] <airdem> are those dom elements?
[08:08:37] <Es0teric> airdem no they are not
[08:08:56] <airdem> looks like you have to build your own unique function
[08:09:26] <airdem> what do you want to be unique?
[08:09:38] <Es0teric> airdem i just want it to filter out the duplicates
[08:09:40] <Es0teric> thats all
[08:09:44] <airdem> *what property of the object
[08:09:54] <airdem> so ALL properties?
[08:09:57] <Es0teric> yeah
[08:10:05] <Es0teric> i just want to filter out the duplicate objects
[08:10:27] <EdwardIII> hey, i don't suppose it's possible to make jquery validate show an error response from it's json remote: endpoint?
[08:10:33] <airdem> you could convert every object by glueing all properties into one big string
[08:10:40] <airdem> and then compare those to each other
[08:10:41] <EdwardIII> read the docs, done a ton of googling, can't see any indication that it's possible, it just seems to expect 'true' or 'false'
[08:11:18] <EdwardIII> i've got one endpoint that does a ton of different tests and returns the specific error message that's needed (e.g. already taken, doesn't validate, etc)
[08:11:42] <Es0teric> airdem is there another way?
[08:12:49] <airdem> Es0teric, http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19501441/remove-duplicate-objects-from-an-array-using-javascript ?
[08:14:38] <Es0teric> oh snap, thanks airdem
[08:14:55] <airdem> enjoy

[08:21:39] <obert> getting mad with my photo gallery.
[08:21:43] <DeafGoose> Hi All, I have the following html table: http://pastebin.com/hRQFWy0N , Im using this selector to pick the <tr> elements desired: http://pastebin.com/EDx36yWK however its picking up all <tr> and I would like to pick only the ones where the checkbox input is set to "checked"
[08:23:33] <airdem> DeafGoose, $('tr input:checked').parent('tr').doStuff(...);
[08:23:46] <decx> curious airdem
[08:24:33] <airdem> decx, could it be that .wrap only works after appending?
[08:25:06] <airdem> decx, http://jsfiddle.net/dsRnS/3/ indeed
[08:26:16] <DeafGoose> http://pastebin.com/vSDkBZry not getting anything
[08:26:39] <ShawnRisk> How do I get a backlog of this room?  I typed in something much earlier but don't have the history
[08:26:49] <decx> aha! airdem still strange that you can wrap into a variable
[08:27:43] <decx> i never tried but this needs further inspection
[08:28:11] <decx> maybe it's because how wrap works (however this is)
[08:28:35] <airdem> i believe the same goes for adding events to objects. i vaguely remember having that problem in the past
[08:30:40] <fabioportieri> if you want to manipulate the dom you have to manipulate the dom.. if the element is not in the dom yet (append)...
[08:30:51] <airdem> DeafGoose, $('tr input').prop('checked') do me a favor and try this :)
[08:32:40] <airdem> DeafGoose, $('#tblmobileActions tr[id*=action_] input').prop('checked').parent('tr')... in your case
[08:32:51] <DeafGoose> agh I was confused where to add this
[08:32:52] <DeafGoose> :d
[08:32:54] <DeafGoose> :)
[08:34:12] <zumba_addict> do you think folks it's possible to put a breakpoint after we clicked on a button? It's because we don't know which file the button resides
[08:35:03] <airdem> fabioportieri, wasnt expecting that .wrap() is dom only
[08:35:19] <ShawnRisk> decx: would you know if the answer to my question?
[08:35:42] <airdem> ShawnRisk, depends on your chat client and os
[08:36:07] <decx> ShawnRisk http://irc.jquery.org/%23jquery/
[08:36:25] <airdem> cool!
[08:36:56] <ShawnRisk> decx: thanks
[08:36:58] <ShawnRisk> Should I be using offsetTop or offset().top and window.pageYOffset or window.offsetY?
[08:39:16] <myosotis> t
[08:47:41] <thebope>  Does anyone know why $('.fileUpload').change(function() {....} wouldn't trigger when I click and choose something in an html 5 element <input type="file" class="fileUpload" name="file" />?
[08:47:51] <thebope> I'm trying to do something akin to http://stackoverflow.com/questions/166221/how-can-i-upload-files-asynchronously-with-jquery/8758614#8758614
[08:47:59] <thebope> The file browser window pops down and lets me browse my files and choose on
[08:48:43] <airdem>  /> this is not html5 btw :P
[08:49:40] <airdem> thebope, can you paste your code?
[08:49:57] <thebope> airdem, oh no more />?
[08:50:03] <thebope> yea one sec
[08:50:18] <airdem> yeah no more of those ugly things
[08:52:50] <ShawnRisk> any ideas on my question?
[08:52:55] <decx> airdem if you go the other way around with wrapInner you can build your object completely before adding it to the dom http://jsfiddle.net/decx/dsRnS/4/
[08:53:20] <thebope> airdem http://pastebin.com/VrDFimwv
[08:53:54] <airdem> decx, good to know that one. thank you
[08:54:34] <airdem> thebope, put the <script> at the end of body
[08:54:37] <decx> still strange, gotta look into .wrap to really figure it out
[08:54:44] <thebope> okay thanks airdem
[08:55:13] <airdem> or wrap a $(function() { your code }); around your code :)
[08:59:15] <thebope> works thanks again airdem
[08:59:32] <thebope> ahh okay on DOM load
[08:59:38] <rethus> Jquery ui: plugin sortable. http://jsfiddle.net/wYJ8V/1/
[08:59:54] <thebope> So, for <... /> we just, don't close now airdem ?
[08:59:59] <rethus> how can i got this: put adressen or kontakte to ausgabe.
[09:00:34] <rethus> and remove droped kontakte and adressen back to its frames, but not move adressen to kontakte
[09:01:00] <airdem> thebope, yes, same goes for <br> <hr> etc
[09:01:08] <thebope> crazy
[09:01:10] <thebope> thanks airdem
[09:01:15] <airdem> enjoy thebope
[09:01:27] <thebope> haha time for some refactoring
[09:01:33] <thebope> if you can call removing slashies refactoring
[09:01:47] <decx> html5 doesn't mind either way
[09:02:11] <duch_kazatel> some tags need explicit closing, others do not.
[09:02:11] <Velveeta> yeah but html5 also doesn't care about things like unclosed li's.. but i personally find that ugly and ambiguous… i close all tags, always :D
[09:02:23] <duch_kazatel> unclosed lis are invalid I though...
[09:02:27] <duch_kazatel> *thought
[09:02:44] <Velveeta> i think they're legal in 5
[09:04:12] <duch_kazatel> "An li element’s end tag may be omitted if the li element is immediately followed by another li element or if there is no more content in the parent element."
[09:04:17] <duch_kazatel> news to me.  that's gross.
[09:04:28] <Velveeta> definitely
[09:04:38] <duch_kazatel> be cool and use them anyway
[09:05:58] <airdem> http://validator.w3.org/check had no problem with an unclosed <li>
[09:06:22] <airdem> and i had only one <li> inside my <ul>
[09:06:37] <airdem>  or if there is no more content in the parent element
[09:06:44] <airdem> didnt read :P
[09:06:50] <decx> it may be valid, but we'Re still allowed to look down upon it in disgust
[09:07:33] <decx> "down upon it" that doesn't read right, is that real english?
[09:08:19] <airdem> 411 million google results
[09:08:24] <airdem> must be right!!!!
[09:09:00] <duch_kazatel> yup, it is real.
[09:12:46] <ShawnRisk> Should I be using offsetTop or offset().top and window.pageYOffset or window.offsetY?
[09:14:23] <VectorX> can someone tell me why this isnt working, the CAT item of the unchecked checkboxes should be "" http://jsfiddle.net/L4HHL/15/
[09:18:24] <duch_kazatel> ShawnRisk depends - in what context?
[09:18:50] <duch_kazatel> ShawnRisk if you want the offset from the top of the window, use offset().top
[09:18:50] <VectorX> anybody ?
[09:19:04] <duch_kazatel> VectorX the "cat" item?
[09:19:44] <VectorX> the hidden input with name starting with decat, there is one below each checkbox, a few lines below
[09:20:25] <VectorX> the name would be decat["+ (checkbox value) + "]']
[09:20:47] <VectorX> although the first two in the example has the same name
[09:20:50] <ShawnRisk> duch_kazatel: I want to know which of these are exactly the same in different browsers?
[09:21:26] <duch_kazatel> VectorX lines 7 8 and 9 look wrong to me.
[09:21:53] <ShawnRisk> duch_kazatel: As in if I scroll down the page, will the image move the same
[09:21:56] <ShawnRisk> ?
[09:22:03] <duch_kazatel> ShawnRisk for that you'd have to go read the various definitions.  iirc the offset().top one should be consistent accross browsers.
[09:22:30] <ShawnRisk> duch_kazatel: okay, what about the other item I wanted to know?
[09:22:40] <duch_kazatel> what was it?
[09:23:01] <ShawnRisk> duch_kazatel: window.pageYOffset or window.offsetY
[09:23:09] <VectorX> duch_kazatel well the idea there is im getting all the checkboxes into cb1, then getting the checked into cb2, then getting uncecked by $($(cb1).not(cb2)
[09:23:48] <duch_kazatel> ShawnRisk window.offsetY isn't a real thing...
[09:23:49] <VectorX> im only acting on the cb's that has value of .de at the end in them
[09:24:00] <ShawnRisk> duch_kazatel: oh oops :P
[09:24:38] <VectorX> so for each checkbox i need to get the <input type="hidden" class="decat" name="decat.... below that and chage value to ""
[09:25:57] <duch_kazatel> VectorX ah.  one sec.
[09:26:50] <duch_kazatel> wait even though each of those values are all ready blank?
[09:27:34] <VectorX> they are not blank its the name="decat  item not the name="domainsregperiod
[09:28:03] <VectorX> like 2 <td>'s below the checkbox
[09:28:10] <VectorX> in the same <tr>
[09:28:24] <duch_kazatel> aaah in the status column.
[09:28:30] <decx> man, i hate traversing tables
[09:28:31] <duch_kazatel> yeah, one sec.
[09:31:55] <duch_kazatel> so here's the most simplistic way to do that: http://jsfiddle.net/L4HHL/16/
[09:33:13] <ShawnRisk> duch_kazatel: the item is still much higher in Chrome then Firefox.  How would I fix that?  Do you want to see the code?
[09:33:32] <duch_kazatel> ShawnRisk you need to go read up on the differences.
[09:34:30] <VectorX> duch_kazatel seems like that just makes everything ""
[09:34:46] <VectorX> i only need it to do that for those that have not checked
[09:35:07] <duch_kazatel> you originally said "so for each checkbox i need to get the <input type="hidden" class="decat" name="decat.... below that and chage value to """
[09:35:31] <duch_kazatel> so now you want to do that ONLY if that prior checkbox within the TR is empty?
[09:36:30] <VectorX> well i orinally said the rest too
[09:36:55] <duch_kazatel> i'm not seeing it, but easy fix.
[09:36:56] <duch_kazatel> one sec.
[09:37:51] <VectorX> from what your quoted me, two lines about that from what i said was: <VectorX> duch_kazatel well the idea there is im getting all the checkboxes into cb1, then getting the checked into cb2, then getting uncecked by $($(cb1).not(cb2)
[09:38:03] <ShawnRisk> duch_kazatel: yes but I think this is other code that is affecting this too.  I am doing some math and my math might be off but unsure on how to make this prefect.
[09:38:08] <duch_kazatel> i wasn't sure of why you were doing that, VectorX
[09:38:19] <duch_kazatel> one second, VectorX
[09:38:40] <VectorX> so if i could just get this working:  $(this).closest("tr").find("input[type=hidden][name='decat[" + $(this).val() + "]']").first().val("");
[09:38:56] <VectorX> coz i already got the collection of unchecked
[09:39:13] <duch_kazatel> VectorX the issue is that what you're doing is super heavy lifting and totally unnecessary.
[09:39:31] <VectorX> im sure, if you got a better way that would be good
[09:40:06] <ShawnRisk> duch_kazatel: I can pastebin the code for you and you can look this over if you think that would be good
[09:40:26] <VectorX> and as i kept repeating the first two checkboxes have the same name, which is what creates a bit of an issue, if not i could have been done by now
[09:40:35] <duch_kazatel> ShawnRisk I'll have enough time to help VectorX, and then I have to do my normal job.
[09:40:35] <duch_kazatel> sorry.
[09:40:37] <VectorX> same name/ as in balue
[09:40:46] <VectorX> value
[09:42:36] <duch_kazatel> VectorX how about this: http://jsfiddle.net/L4HHL/18/
[09:44:30] <VectorX> duch_kazatel at glance that looks good
[09:44:57] <VectorX> ill have to play with it a bit, but i think thats it, good thinking working back
[09:46:01] <ShawnRisk> duch_kazatel: no worries, thanks
[09:46:15] <ShawnRisk> duch_kazatel: I will put this in pastebin anyways for others to help
[09:46:41] <duch_kazatel> ShawnRisk folks tend to not like pastebin more often than not.  a working jsfiddle is always preferable.
[09:47:06] <ShawnRisk> I know but I like pastebin better
[09:47:11] <ShawnRisk> anyways I have to go for lunch
[09:47:19] <duch_kazatel> most other folks don't.
[09:47:21] <duch_kazatel> just fyi.
[09:47:25] <ShawnRisk> I know
[09:47:30] <duch_kazatel> okay.
[09:47:51] <ShawnRisk> thanks for the help
[09:48:45] <duch_kazatel> some people.
[09:50:59] <VectorX> duch_kazatelh thanks for the help
[09:51:04] <duch_kazatel> of course.
[10:00:24] <HenryCH> http://jsfiddle.net/x5X6s/  What do I have to do so that the outer box div expands when I enlarge the textarea?
[10:00:48] <HenryCH> If I remove the min and max width, the box changes size as I drag it around the page
[10:03:15] <HenryCH> So basically I want the outer rectangle box to _only_ change size to accommodate a larger textarea
[10:04:28] <decx> get rid of right and max-width in .box{}
[10:05:13] <HenryCH> I need the left and right to center it
[10:05:53] <decx> easy center: width: 200px; left: 50%; margin-left: -100px
[10:06:22] <decx> whenever margin:auto won't work that is
[10:06:45] <airdem> was going to suggest that :)
[10:06:45] <HenryCH> let me try that
[10:06:58] <HenryCH> I've tried margin auto
[10:07:05] <HenryCH> does it not work because of the position fixed?
[10:07:08] <decx> that wont do on a fixed element
[10:07:09] <decx> yes
[10:07:51] <airdem> why do you need it to be fixed?
[10:08:37] <decx> and if you're already using jqui why not use dialog() for a modal box?
[10:10:29] <jamto11> i am using pusher(websockets)/jquery ui draggable to provide real-time draggability in my board game. does any have a good idea of how i should implement feature tests testing if pusher is correctly updating the tokens that are being dragged?
[10:10:52] <HenryCH> actually I did the box before I added the draggable

[10:26:11] <lianzinho> guys, in a jQuery plugin, in which moment the options options is modified? I mean, when I call a plugin and pass an object with options… how can, inside the plugin, have a copy of my defaults?
[10:27:01] <lianzinho> *options object
[10:28:41] <decx> lianzinho i do it like this: http://jsfiddle.net/decx/eP4dV/
[10:31:20] <lianzinho> decx: so, how to use the default value unmodified?
[10:33:39] <decx> oh you mean if you want to compare a value that is passed from the call with the default?
[10:33:45] <decx> hm good question
[10:34:09] <Ericx2x> is lazy loading usually done by jquery/javascript?
[10:34:21] <duch_kazatel> basically.
[10:34:22] <decx> should still be in $.fn.mypluginname.defaults.foo
[10:35:05] <lianzinho> decx: ah… the secret then is $.fn.name stuff
[10:35:22] <lianzinho> I was trying to access defaults.foo directly
[10:35:31] <lianzinho> but it was being overwritten

[10:39:47] <duch_kazatel> if not, what is a "slice" effect?
[10:39:54] <lianzinho> decx: it's bla in both… hahha
[10:40:12] <decx> 20 elements are sliced to 10 first duch_kazatel ;)
[10:40:26] <lianzinho> ah
[10:40:30] <lianzinho> gotcha
[10:40:32] <lianzinho> nevermind
[10:40:33] <lianzinho> ok
[10:40:34] <lianzinho> thanks

[10:40:43] <abailarri> duch_kazatel, no, slice
[10:41:01] <duch_kazatel> yeah i see it now.
[10:42:48] <decx> anyway, looks like the right result to me abailarri
[10:43:01] <abailarri> decx, yes i'm stuppid
[10:43:15] <abailarri> i put 10 when i have 10 entries

[10:47:19] <Bloomberg> Hi Guys!!
[10:47:44] <Bloomberg> what function works like "   window.open() "
[10:48:05] <duch_kazatel> window.open() works like window.open()
[10:48:22] <Bloomberg> what happen is that I need to generate a pdf report
[10:48:39] <decx> the variant that isnt blocked by popup blockers is generally called a modal window Bloomberg
[10:48:45] <Bloomberg> the only way that I did get it is with window.open
[10:49:07] <Bloomberg> I try to do it with post of ajax and dowsn't receive nothing
[10:49:11] <Bloomberg> doesn't*
[10:49:15] <duch_kazatel> your question is making absolutely no sense.
[10:49:21] <duch_kazatel> start from the beginning.
[10:49:39] <Bloomberg> I'm working with php
[10:50:02] <Bloomberg> In the php controller i have the script that generates pdf report
[10:50:33] <mrchris> Hi All  I am creating a project management style app for software projects, and I'd like to have the ability to design simple screens layouts within the app.  Is there something in jquery allready prerolled that could help me with that?
[10:51:19] <decx> you want what is called a wireframe generator mrchris
[10:51:28] <decx> or wireframe tool
[10:51:30] <Bloomberg> from the view I have a form, and with jquery I'm doing a prevent default submit form for replace and send it with post passing custom data
[10:51:32] <decx> wireframe whatever
[10:51:32] <Bloomberg> ok?
[10:51:43] <duch_kazatel> Bloomberg ok.
[10:52:00] <Bloomberg> The problem is only return me the pdf file when I do window.open()
[10:52:16] <Bloomberg> but with this I have the limitation that I cannot pass custom data
[10:52:18] <mrchris> decx: ok. There are many online solutions for this that you can pay money and subscribe to.  I'd like to integrate this ability within my app rather than use a 3rd party.
[10:52:41] <Bloomberg> I need do it with post for customize an array with several data
[10:52:50] <Bloomberg> understand me?
[10:53:01] <decx> mrchris nothing in vanilla jquery afaik
[10:53:34] <decx> so you'd have to roll you own and depending on how expensive your time is, investing in a 3rd party solution might be the better way ;)
[10:53:35] <duch_kazatel> Bloomberg can you share your code in a fiddle?
[10:54:02] <Bloomberg> ok
[10:54:04] <duch_kazatel> Bloomberg because what you're asking still isn't maaking sense to me.
[10:55:14] <Bloomberg> http://jsfiddle.net/mF33C/
[10:55:15] <Bloomberg> is this
[10:56:06] <Bloomberg> like this works ok, but is incomplete because I cannot to pass customized info
[10:56:19] <Bloomberg> I was trying to do it like the comment post
[10:56:50] <decx> you're pushing your input values in arrays, but then you don't do anything with those arrays. what's up with that?
[10:56:59] <duch_kazatel> window.open('misiones/generatereportMision/'+<?php echo $wire; ?>); - don't do this.  request a URL with specific params and have your application respond accordingly.
[10:57:00] <duch_kazatel> start there.
[10:57:08] <mrchris> decx: ok thanks.  We don't pay for anything at my place, so using a 3rd party service is out of the question. I'm also not good enough at javascript to make an attempt and I don't have the time.  Looks like i'll just have to suck it
[10:57:44] <Bloomberg> in the comment post side I was trying to do it
[10:57:46] <decx> yeah wireframing is pretty involved
[10:57:58] <decx> i wouldnt want to write something like that from scratch either
[10:58:45] <duch_kazatel> Bloomberg you have all this data that you aren't sending anywhere...
[10:58:46] <Bloomberg> http://jsfiddle.net/Dsjd7/1/
[10:58:58] <Bloomberg> I will need to do some like this
[10:59:05] <Bloomberg> but of this way doesn't works
[10:59:26] <duch_kazatel> http://api.jquery.com/jquery.post/
[10:59:30] <duch_kazatel> read these - it'll help.
[11:00:09] <decx> mrchris ylj
[11:00:25] <Bloomberg> http://jsfiddle.net/EPvw2/1/
[11:00:25] <decx> mrchris you can probably hack something together with jquery ui
[11:00:28] <decx> ;)
[11:00:30] <Bloomberg> I already tested some like this
[11:01:21] <decx> resizable, draggable and droppable could work together to create a mock-mockup builder
[11:01:54] <duch_kazatel> Bloomberg what the URL getting written into '<?php echo $wire; ?>'?
[11:02:12] <Bloomberg> is int value
[11:02:17] <Bloomberg> for complete a query
[11:02:30] <Bloomberg> is the where clause of a sql query
[11:02:59] <xqo> hi

[11:03:25] <jax> can i tell $.post() to post to the current page?
[11:03:30] <jax> instead of defining a url
[11:04:05] <decx> xqo if a previous plugin or whatever is missing a ; then it's adding it just in case
[11:08:34] <duch_kazatel> Bloomberg your latest example should work, as long as the data getting passed to that success handler is a URL.
[11:08:45] <duch_kazatel> a fully qualified URL.
[11:11:14] <mordof> question about $("selector").append() - does it return the selector element that the contents of append was added to? or the appended element?
[11:11:27] <mordof> it's not in the docs oddly enough, and i forget the behavior
[11:11:53] <duch_kazatel> i'll bet the selector with the new content.
[11:11:57] <duch_kazatel> but I could be wrong.
[11:12:17] <mordof> duch_kazatel: ok. that's my suspicion as well.
[11:12:48] <mordof> shouldn't be too hard to test actually... duch_kazatel, i'll let you know
[11:12:55] <duch_kazatel> that'd be nice.
[11:14:35] <mordof> duch_kazatel: yup, returns the selector with the content added
[11:14:45] <duch_kazatel> rad.  figured.  that'd make chaining a little easier/.
[11:19:31] <mordof> duch_kazatel: yeah exactly. I just wasn't sure if it was $('selector').append('<p>test</p>').filter(' > p').css('color', 'red');    or instead, jumping back up to the parent.
[11:19:54] <mordof> but i suppose the creators of jquery decided that the scenario where you'd append, and then work with the parent more was more frequent
[11:20:15] <mordof> also - it follows normal chaining returns
[11:20:17] * mordof shrugs
[11:21:01] <mordof> making a plugin that creates some elements in it's own append to keep it clean for the user, and wanted to make sure i followed normal behavior :)
[11:21:07] <duch_kazatel> it's more consistent with other methods - I have a selector, I'd like to work against that selector.
[11:21:14] <duch_kazatel> ah yeah
[11:21:16] * mordof nods
[11:21:16] <duch_kazatel> makes sense.
[11:30:44] <ShawnRisk> How come: elePos = Math.round($('#secondsection').offset().top) - 450; is different in Firefox and Chrome?  I saw that Firefox loads faster then Chrome and might not pick up all the elements onload, what to do?
[11:44:19] <lianzinho> how to achieve click toggle after the deprecation of .toggle() ?
[11:46:31] <jphase> lianzinho: .toggle isn't deprecated
[11:46:45] <lianzinho> jphase: for click is...
[11:46:55] <lianzinho> it's not for effects
[11:47:01] <jphase> oic, for click
[11:47:14] <lianzinho> with this signature: Bind two or more handlers to the matched elements, to be executed on alternate clicks.
[11:47:17] <Velveeta> just write it yourself with a .hasClass() check internally
[11:47:22] <jphase> if/else
[11:47:52] <lianzinho> in the same biding?
[11:48:03] <jphase> in the click event
[11:48:13] <lianzinho> click… then inside the function, if has class then do another stuff ?
[11:48:20] <lianzinho> simple as that?
[11:48:21] <jphase> yeah, if/else
[11:48:27] <jphase> and under that if/else use .toggleClass
[11:50:18] <ShawnRisk> How come: elePos = Math.round($('#secondsection').offset().top) - 450; is different in Firefox and Chrome?  I saw that Firefox loads faster then Chrome and might not pick up all the elements onload, what to do?
[11:51:05] <jphase> ShawnRisk: do you have things like images in that secondsection element?
[11:51:20] <jphase> or in the element above even?
[11:51:43] <jphase> cause the top offset will changes as elements load is why I'm asking
[11:56:22] <ShawnRisk> jphase: the secondsection has a background-image and the firstsection has an img tag.
[11:56:30] <ShawnRisk> sorry got disconnected somehow
[11:58:13] <jphase> ShawnRisk: if you use your code that calculates the top offset after the images in the firstsection (or anything above it) is done loading then you'll probably achieve better consistency
[11:58:58] <jphase> i.e. bind it to $('#firstsection img').on('load'     or even $(window).on('load'
[12:02:40] <mordof> ShawnRisk: the other approach is to use CSS to specify the width and height of the image in advance, which would allow the page to set the correct size before the image loaded
[12:03:20] <mordof> of course - with this method you're relying on the fact that more images won't be added without having the heights specified as well (which would end up breaking it again) so it's a trade-off
[12:03:34] <ingsoc> Hi all
[12:03:39] <mordof> ingsoc: hi
[12:04:30] <Starlyc> Hello?
[12:04:35] <mordof> Starlyc: yo
[12:04:59] <ShawnRisk> jphase: that didn't work out as it is not loading the variables when I do that.
[12:05:05] <Starlyc> I need a bit of help, do you have any experiance with jQuery Mobile?
[12:05:25] <mordof> Starlyc: not a lot - but i have a lot of js experience in general, so i may still be able to help depending on the problem.
[12:05:29] <mordof> Starlyc: what's going on?
[12:05:32] <ingsoc> if i was creating a jquery component, how are custom events defined.  e.g. if i was creating a datepicker, and i wanted to define a 'cangeDate' event so you can do $(component).on('changeDate, function {})
[12:05:32] <jphase> ShawnRisk: which variables?
[12:05:59] <Starlyc> I'm adding a data-role attr with this line of code: $("#form_2").attr("data-role", "collapsible");
[12:06:01] <ShawnRisk> mordof: the height of the image is different in chrome and firefox on load for some reason.
[12:06:05] <jphase> ShawnRisk: make the variables available inside your .load function or global
[12:06:13] <ingsoc> basically i am using a component and just wondered how they are defined
[12:06:21] <Starlyc> The attr is being apply, however it is not inheriting the jQuery classes.
[12:06:23] <mordof> ingsoc: you want .trigger()
[12:06:32] <ShawnRisk> jphase: do you want to see all the code or a live example?
[12:06:41] <jphase> ShawnRisk: sure
[12:06:49] <ShawnRisk> jphase: which?
[12:06:57] <jphase> either is effective
[12:07:06] <mordof> Starlyc: got an example code to show?
[12:07:30] <Starlyc> $("#form_2").attr("data-role", "collapsible");
[12:07:49] <Starlyc> I tried adding .trigger("create") to the end of it, but that did nothing.
[12:07:50] <mordof> Starlyc: then what are you refering to when you say jQuery classes?
[12:07:59] <mordof> Starlyc: .trigger was for ingsoc not you
[12:08:42] <Starlyc> When you add attr to your tags jQuery Mobile adds in classes to style & format for you
[12:08:58] <ingsoc> mordof: ok i see so jquery can wire up linking trigger('myEvent') to the user of a component attaching to $.on('myEvent')
[12:09:06] <Starlyc> You can see more of the code here: https://www.myhhf.com/test/test_jq_form.php
[12:09:11] <ingsoc> mordof: is that right ? :)
[12:09:37] <mordof> ingsoc: yup. .trigger('event') is a way to fire custom events. so if the user of the lib has bound an event handler looking for that event, it'll throw the handler
[12:10:08] <ShawnRisk> jphase: just to say, my code is super a mess, could be nicer.  Code: http://pastebin.com/NSVC4SD2 the main function to look at is logoaction()
[12:10:23] <Starlyc> I think so. I'm not entirely sure. This plugin is very advanced to me.
[12:10:31] <ingsoc> mordof: super, thanks, clears that one up
[12:10:41] <mordof> ingsoc: you're welcome :)
[12:10:44] <mordof> Starlyc: one sec
[12:10:53] <jphase> sec ShawnRisk, accidentall just quit my browser lol
[12:11:07] <avri> https://dpaste.de/1TMS - I am trying to get bxslider to work, but for some reason the images disappear after a transition, and I just see the white background
[12:11:29] <mordof> Starlyc: i'm still very confused by what you're referring to in jQuery classes - .attr is ONLY supposed to apply attribute data, nothing more. mobile or not
[12:12:14] <Starlyc> The point is, the attr is applied successfully, yet the it is not functioning
[12:12:30] <ShooterMG> I'm calling jQuery.ajax, with datatype:'json', and using a packet sniffer I can see that the request is being returned with a valid json object correctly, but for some reason the ajaxError function is being called....any ideas?
[12:12:40] <mordof> Starlyc: i need more information on what is not functioning. if the attr is being applied successfully, what else isn't working?
[12:13:03] <Starlyc> If you look here: https://www.myhhf.com/test/test_jq_form.php YOu will see one form at the bottom the is collpsed & proper. But the other one is expanded yet has the same attr as the other.
[12:13:14] <jphase> ShawnRisk: so declare your elePos where it is without a value, then set it in $(window).load(
[12:13:28] <Starlyc> Form 1 is functioning properly, Form 2 is not
[12:13:30] <mordof> Starlyc: ok, thank you for that - now i can start to look at it
[12:13:46] <mordof> Starlyc: when you ask questions, you need to ask about the problem, not what you think is the cause :)
[12:14:22] <Starlyc> I never had an idea of the cause. :/
[12:14:27] <mordof> oooh i see what you're referring to
[12:14:41] <Starlyc> Any ideas as to why this is?
[12:14:41] <mordof> Starlyc: right - so it's more a wording issue, you were focused on the .attr, which isn't the problem
[12:14:54] <mordof> Starlyc: you're applying collapsible the wrong way, is my first guess. hold on
[12:15:45] <Starlyc> The only difference between Form 1 & Form 2 is that Form 1 is being added inline where as Form 2 is being added dynamically
[12:18:07] <_rgn> I need a way for an instance of a "class" to communicate outside, should I extend the class with an event emitter or use callbacks as properties? myobj.onThisEvent = function() {}; etc.
[12:18:43] <ShawnRisk> jphase: which line?
[12:19:46] <jphase> ShawnRisk: line 16 change to elePos;   and then add a load even of like, $(window).load(function(){ elePos = Math.round(fc.offset().top) - 450; });
[12:20:18] <mordof> _rgn: i suppose that depends on the flow of what you're trying to make. either can work, but it depends on what would make the most sense
[12:20:39] <_rgn> yeah, that's what i'm trying to figure out
[12:20:39] <jphase> s/even/event
[12:20:54] <_rgn> kind of like event emitter pattern more, but it's an extra dependency
[12:21:07] <mordof> _rgn: how is it an extra dependency?
[12:21:14] <mordof> _rgn: triggering events isn't that hard
[12:21:52] <_rgn> nope, but keeping track of them is extra code i don't want
[12:22:09] <mordof> Starlyc: so far the main thing i can think of is that jquery mobile would look for attr collapsible on load to add the css to it. i haven't confirmed this yet
[12:22:12] <_rgn> that logic should come from outside
[12:22:31] <mordof> _rgn: why would you have to keep track of triggered events?
[12:22:44] <_rgn> keeping track of handlers
[12:22:58] <_rgn> just to be clear, i'm not talking about jquery objects
[12:23:29] <Starlyc> I believe that is the case, do have any idea on how I could get around this?
[12:23:31] <mordof> _rgn: are you talking vanilla js then?
[12:23:40] <mordof> Starlyc: apply the css classes yourself
[12:23:44] <mordof> Starlyc: is the easiest approach
[12:23:59] <_rgn> mordof: i have jquery but the object is not a jquery object in this case
[12:24:27] <Starlyc> Are you familiar with jQuery mobile? If that was simple I would've just created this myself.
[12:24:32] <mordof> _rgn: event triggering is not the easiest to set up if you're doing it without jquery.
[12:24:41] <mordof> Starlyc: it's one line of code with a .css function...
[12:24:42] <Starlyc> There is a LOT that goes into it.
[12:24:46] <mordof> Starlyc: not at all hard
[12:24:56] <Starlyc> could you show me an example?
[12:25:11] <mordof> Starlyc: copy the css classes on the form1 after load, and apply them with .css
[12:25:49] <ShawnRisk> jphase: that is good but when I do: console.log((windowY/elePos)*elePos); Firefox and Chrome stop at a different point.
[12:26:06] <Starlyc> I would suggest you look at how many that would be. I know there is a much simpler sulution. It's just a matter of finding it.
[12:26:11] <avri> anyone?
[12:26:12] <Starlyc> THank you for you help, though.
[12:26:52] <mordof> Starlyc: *sighs* there's like 6 classes... seriously, lol. the other option i just found is that jquery mobile provides a .collapsible function
[12:27:05] <mordof> Starlyc: read the docs for collapsibl
[12:28:30] <mordof> AGGGHHH
[12:28:37] <mordof> why do i get so frustrated when people do that, lol
[12:28:39] <jphase> ShawnRisk: hmm, and you've confirmed that elePos is the thing that's different in ff vs. chrome?
[12:29:07] <mordof> _rgn: anyway, back to what you're working on.. if you're not going to be doing it in jquery, callbacks are simpler
[12:30:50] <jphase> mordof: because you spent time you could be using to work on your own stuff just so they can leave prematurely... sucks
[12:30:58] * jphase pats mordof on back
[12:31:01] <mordof> jphase: true say, heh
[12:31:37] <ShawnRisk> jphase: since I changed line 16 to what you said that is okay now but rechecking I see windowY as different in both.  As when I scroll once in Chrome, I get 40 and in Firefox I get 57.
[12:35:00] <GuffyJarvis> is jQuery Progressive Enhancement a concept or a plugin?
[12:35:22] <jphase> ShawnRisk: try using $(window).scrollTop() instead
[12:35:45] <mordof> progressive enhancement is a concept in general... i'm not sure if someone tried to put a plugin in for it though
[12:36:14] <GuffyJarvis> thanks mordof - Is it worth using?
[12:36:25] <snover> no
[12:36:26] <mordof> GuffyJarvis: generally, progressive enhancement means you create things as basic as possible, no js or css involved. then as you want to add functionality, you test to make sure that functionality exists / is capable before actually letting the code run
[12:37:25] <mordof> GuffyJarvis: there's 2 different approaches: graceful degradation, and progressive enhancement. progressive enhancement is a bit more work, but ends up not loading things that won't function anyway. graceful degredation tries to do things, and if it fails - ensures it'll roll back to something that will work without breaking things
[12:37:54] <mordof> GuffyJarvis: both have merits, but choosing one or the other is important, especially if you're working with newer additions to js/css/html 5 and are catering to older browsers / mobile environments
[12:38:18] <alaing_away> evening ppl
[12:38:27] <mordof> GuffyJarvis: progressive enhancement can end up being cleaner, but it's more work. Graceful degredation can end up being a pain if not kept track of properly
[12:38:34] <mordof> both work well though when done fully
[12:39:09] <ShawnRisk> jphase: still the same.  When I scroll, it is the same.
[12:39:20] <jphase> hmmm
[12:39:45] <mordof> GuffyJarvis: if you're working on something that doesn't need to care whether it breaks in a different browser, then no need to include anything like that.
[12:39:53] <jphase> ShawnRisk: if you console.log($(window).height()); is it different as well?
[12:39:59] <mordof> alaing_away: good evening :)
[12:40:24] <alaing> lol i'm back :-D
[12:40:35] <mordof> alaing: heh
[12:40:48] <alaing> so anyone here going to jquery uk conf?
[12:40:50] <GuffyJarvis> mordof thanks - that's good to know.. so it's more of a design philosophy
[12:41:02] <mordof> GuffyJarvis: design/development. it applies to both
[12:41:11] <GuffyJarvis> it came up when looking at this link http://remysharp.com/demo/marquee.html
[12:41:17] <ShawnRisk> jphase: yes
[12:41:20] <mordof> GuffyJarvis: but yes, it's how you approach the problem of "will this feature be supported in x situation? if not, how do i handle it?"
[12:41:31] <avri> https://dpaste.de/1TMS - I am trying to get bxslider to work, but for some reason the images disappear after a transition, and I just see the white background
[12:41:48] <avri> how can I fix this?
[12:42:09] <mordof> GuffyJarvis: that's.... ick
[12:42:16] <mordof> GuffyJarvis: they got rid of that tag a long time ago for a reason, lol
[12:42:27] <GuffyJarvis> yeah it's back again :)
[12:42:34] <mordof> KILL IT WITH FIRE!!!!
[12:42:35] <mordof> so gross
[12:42:38] <mordof> GuffyJarvis: please no
[12:43:39] <mordof> GuffyJarvis: but yeah - even in that scenario it's a concept. the plugin checks to see if your browser can handle smoother animations (probably using .animate), and makes use of them. if not, it doesn't try and sticks with the marguee tag
[12:43:47] <mordof> which i'm fairly certain is deprecated/gone
[12:44:27] <mordof> GuffyJarvis: it's completely taken out of HTML 5 after having been deprecated earlier. please don't use that jquery plugin
[12:44:43] <alaing> time to call it a night....
[12:44:46] <GuffyJarvis> It came back in CSS3
[12:44:54] <mordof> GuffyJarvis: link?
[12:45:04] <decx> bye alaing
[12:45:06] <alaing> I'm sure "Javascript: the good parts" will put me to sleep quickly
[12:45:35] <alaing> cheers decx have a good evening
[12:45:43] <GuffyJarvis> http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-marquee/
[12:45:47] <t0astt> Hi everyone, I'm trying to speed up a web application by using AJAX (using SQL) to pull a smaller amount of records and display them on a page than what the application currently does (it pulls all records, regardless of amount). My goal is to pull a smaller amount and let the user page through the records, with AJAX pulling a new certain amount of records each time the user switches to a new page. I tried testing if this would result in a performance increas
[12:47:02] <mordof> t0astt: it potentially can, but it can also create some delays in user experience later on if the responses are slower
[12:47:14] <mordof> GuffyJarvis: that's not just for text
[12:47:39] <mordof> GuffyJarvis: still.. i'm saddened to see that being brought back :/ lol
[12:47:59] <mordof> there's VERY few scenarios where it actually makes sense to use that.. and i'm sure it'll be abused until it gets taken out again
[12:48:08] <ShawnRisk> jphase: any other thoughts?
[12:48:32] <GuffyJarvis> mordof what would you suggest for a solution?
[12:48:47] <mordof> GuffyJarvis: to which problem? marquee? don't use it :p
[12:49:11] <GuffyJarvis> I've got an absolute positioned div containing a list that I need to scrolldown
[12:49:24] <mordof> GuffyJarvis: it's fine that it's being made available... but if it gets used even *close* to how it did in the past, uit'll just be ugly again
[12:49:29] <GuffyJarvis> it's on-mouse over triggered and hangs next to your cursor
[12:49:40] <mordof> o.o
[12:49:46] <duch_kazatel> i actually found a use for a marquee.
[12:49:55] <mordof> duch_kazatel: example?
[12:49:58] <mordof> i'm curious
[12:50:12] <mordof> replicating the matrix text isn't valid
[12:50:16] <duch_kazatel> nope
[12:50:19] <GuffyJarvis> lol
[12:50:43] <duch_kazatel> very limited - we had product titles that were too long, and instead of wrapping them down, we tried having the text scroll once on mousehover.
[12:50:48] <jphase> ShawnRisk: hmm, something is definitely awry - sorry for the delay still at work
[12:50:51] <duch_kazatel> said mousehover also causes content to expend.
[12:51:11] <duch_kazatel> very limited use case, but it actually worked much better than we thought it would.
[12:51:20] <mordof> duch_kazatel: interesting. yeah, that sounds like it could be decent :)
[12:51:40] <jphase> ShawnRisk: I'd try to track down some oddity in css at this point. The window height being different on ff vs. chrome shouldn't be like that. I'd be curious to learn if the different is the exact same amount of pixels?
[12:51:48] <mordof> duch_kazatel: and since it's on hover, you could use entirely CSS for that.
[12:52:32] <duch_kazatel> how far back is the support for that?
[12:52:40] <synth_> is it possible to invoke a "mailto:blah@blah.com" url in jquery? say i've got an element that functions like an anchor but isn't actually an anchor, i'd like to invoke a mailto link when it's clicked. i've tried window.location.href but it doesn't seem to work
[12:52:43] <duch_kazatel> and does that enable a single run-through, instead of an infinite scrolling effect?
[12:52:50] <ShawnRisk> jphase: I have to go out.  I will be on in an hour or so, can I pm you right now?
[12:52:58] <jphase> sure?
[12:53:07] <mordof> duch_kazatel: the newest CSS3 addition allows controlling loop count, yes. if you used CSS3 animations you could replicate the same controlling loop counts too
[12:53:19] <duch_kazatel> that's the issue.
[12:53:23] <duch_kazatel> I have to support back to IE8.
[12:53:30] <jphase> ie8 is dead in 2 months
[12:53:33] <mordof> duch_kazatel: js it is, lol
[12:53:39] <duch_kazatel> jphase tell my customers that.
[12:53:44] <mordof> jphase: not technically - just in principle
[12:53:44] <duch_kazatel> my paying customers.
[12:53:44] <avri> can anyone help me please?
[12:53:54] <mordof> avri: what's the problem?\
[12:53:59] <avri> https://dpaste.de/1TMS - I am trying to get bxslider to work, but for some reason the images disappear after a transition, and I just see the white background
[12:54:00] <jphase> well, when the manufacturer doesn't support it, neither do I :)
[12:54:12] <duch_kazatel> jphase we don't have that luxury.
[12:54:44] <mordof> avri: can you put it in a jsfiddle?
[12:54:58] <mordof> jphase: many people don't have that luxury, no, heh
[12:54:58] <jphase> yeah, there's a couple clients at work that are the same way - we still support IE8 for a select few
[12:55:02] <avri> hmm... let me try
[12:55:25] <duch_kazatel> jphase we're a fairly large ecommerce company, so if folks are still giving us money...
[12:55:28] <mordof> it's also true that if you're targetting certain companies that are larger - they'll likely be running even IE6
[12:55:34] <jphase> but I did recently send out an email to clients saying responsive design bids are for browsers that aren't at end-of-life so IE <= 8 will be additional moneys
[12:55:41] <jphase> we *can* do it, but you will pay :D
[12:55:48] <mordof> oh for sure
[12:55:50] <mordof> that's what i do too
[12:56:00] <duch_kazatel> jphase meh, i'm fine doing fallbacks for the occasional feature.
[12:56:03] <joephilly_> how do I get the height of a window?
[12:56:22] <jphase> joephilly_: $(window).height()
[12:56:27] <GuffyJarvis> I gave up on IE8 when I upgraded to jquery 2
[12:56:38] <joephilly_> jphase, thanks broseph
[12:56:44] <GuffyJarvis> at least for my current project
[12:56:53] <mordof> jphase: couldn't remember if it was property or method, lol
[12:57:01] <jphase> duch_kazatel: agreed. my problem is that they also want responsive themes and such and using frameworks like Foundation (and also jQuery 2.x doesn't support IE8 in some of their stuff too btw) makes life hard
[12:57:14] <jphase> s/they/clients
[12:57:31] <duch_kazatel> jphase that's why you use jquery 1.x :)
[12:57:41] <jphase> yeah, the whole conditional block
[12:57:41] <mordof> jphase: yeah, in those scenarios where they're asking for newer technologies / methodologies - educating them comes into play
[12:57:42] <duch_kazatel> that's why there are two concurrent versions.
[12:57:44] <jphase> still hurts my soul
[12:58:01] <jphase> yep, that's the headache/growing pains I'm going through right now
[12:58:16] <jphase> got in a pissing match with my boss about IE8 end of life
[12:58:30] <duch_kazatel> also: after experiencing the pushstate funk with chrome/safari, i'll gladly deal with IE fallbacks any day.
[12:58:56] <mordof> ok... i need to focus more on my work :/ lol
[12:59:01] <jphase> same things happened with IE7, and IE6 - people will whine when any product dies. I'm happy to put a "use a real browser" link on my personal sites :D
[12:59:01] <mordof> i always focus too much in here
[12:59:05] <jphase> sorry, me too
[12:59:07] <jphase> lol
[13:17:16] <Velveeta> shhhhh
[13:19:51] <raj> if I have `var mythings = $('div').find('.mything')` and I want to remove $specificMyThing from that array (and the DOM), how can I do it?
[13:20:14] <mordof> raj: .remove
[13:20:24] <raj> doesn't remove it from the find
[13:20:42] <duch_kazatel> raj mythings will have that selector cached.\
[13:20:55] <mordof> raj: you'd have to manipulate the array then
[13:20:56] <duch_kazatel> if you update anything that selector matched, the cached result will be out of date.
[13:21:04] <raj> i see
[13:21:13] <raj> so how do people usually handle this?
[13:21:15] <raj> re-find?
[13:21:28] <mordof> raj: splice for the array
[13:21:50] <duch_kazatel> either remove it manually or re-run the selector.
[13:21:56] * mordof nods
[13:22:24] <duch_kazatel> if you're removing a lot of stuff before reusing the selector, do your dom manipulation and then rerun the select0or.
[13:23:15] <raj> not a lot of stuff, just one thing
[13:23:33] <raj> just trying to remove a form element
[13:23:55] <duch_kazatel> are you using the results of your selector before removing the element?
[13:24:30] <mordof> raj: you'll need to determine what index the form element is in the jquery array, and then splice it (if you don't want to re-run the selector). personally i'd just re-run the selector for convenience.
[13:24:41] <raj> if I have the jquery object that I want to remove ($specificMyThing) and the array from the .find(), would I just use .indexOf($specificMyThing) to find the index to splice?
[13:24:50] <mordof> there's a performance difference... but when I use jQuery i tend not to care about that to begin with
[13:25:02] <raj> lol
[13:25:04] <duch_kazatel> raj just rerun the selector at that point.
[13:25:07] <raj> thanks mordof
[13:25:12] <mordof> raj: you'd have to provide more than just the variable to .indexOf
[13:25:13] <duch_kazatel> it'll make your code clearer.
[13:25:35] <raj> fair enough, I'll heed the advice of you two
[13:25:36] <mordof> raj: since .indexOf isn't jquery, it can't interpret the variable element properly i don't think.. honestly i'm not sure
[13:25:40] <hex20dec> Hey people, I'm having a really annoying issue with the jqXHR.getAllResponseHeaders() function, it returns an empty string for some odd reason, anyone know why??
[13:25:49] <raj> mordof, it's just an object I believe
[13:26:05] <mordof> raj: true - but comparing objects straight up like that... not sure how reliable that is
[13:26:07] <raj> so if I can get the index of an object shouldn't I be able to do a jq object as well
[13:26:12] <mordof> unless it's a duplicate item
[13:26:13] <raj> gotcha
[13:26:22] <mordof> or rather, a reference to the same item
[13:26:24] <duch_kazatel> array.indexof() is not supported in older version of IE, either.
[13:26:25] <raj> anyway, I'm rerunning the selector, so it's moot
[13:26:44] <mordof> duch_kazatel: good point, though it could be shimmed if necessary
[13:26:50] <raj> I don't care about IE6 and I'm quickly not caring about 7
[13:26:53] <mordof> raj: cool
[13:27:48] <duch_kazatel> i don't care about anything before 8.  my point still stands.
[13:28:29] <duch_kazatel> array.indexOf() doesn't appear in IE until version 9.
[13:28:36] <hex20dec> Anyone know why I'm getting an empty string from jqXHR.getAllResponseHeaders() function?
[13:28:56] <duch_kazatel> hex20dec CORS problem?
[13:29:33] <hex20dec> duch_kazatel: I do see the headers in the inspector, it returns fine.
[13:30:29] <hex20dec> duch_kazatel: I am sending dataType: 'jsonp'
[13:30:45] <mordof> hex20dec: potentially an out-of-order execution?
[13:30:55] <mordof> are you sure your code is checking them AFTER it's been fully returned?
[13:31:23] <duch_kazatel> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5614735/jqxhr-getallresponseheaders-wont-return-all-headers
[13:31:26] <duch_kazatel> maybe?
[13:31:50] <hex20dec> duch_kazatel: I saw that already, I tried diff browsers
[13:31:53] <hex20dec> Same things.
[13:31:56] <hex20dec> thing*
[13:32:19] <hex20dec> .done(function(data, textStatus, jqXHR){
[13:32:19] <hex20dec> console.log(jqXHR.getAllResponseHeaders());
[13:32:19] <hex20dec> }
[13:32:23] <duch_kazatel> `paste
[13:32:23] <b-ot> duch_kazatel: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[13:33:27] <duch_kazatel> wait if it's jsonpis jqxhr iven a thing?
[13:34:12] <avri> http://jsfiddle.net/RkDtx/
[13:34:18] <duch_kazatel> yeah jsonp gets treated differently iirc.
[13:34:41] <mordof> avri: whoa... lol
[13:35:18] <duch_kazatel> avri the css panel only takes css.
[13:35:22] <duch_kazatel> not html css refs.
[13:35:26] <mordof> not quite what i meant by a jsfiddle >.<
[13:35:33] <avri> lol
[13:35:47] <duch_kazatel> if you have external resources, use the correct part of the tool: http://i.imgur.com/NWisZSj.png
[13:36:21] <avri> ah
[13:36:22] <hex20dec> duch_kazatel: mordof: http://jsbin.com/mage/1/edit
[13:37:05] <duch_kazatel> http://jsbin.com/mage/3/edit
[13:37:15] <avri> o well... I'll debug this tomorrow :/
[13:37:32] <avri> thanks though :)
[13:44:03] <hex20dec> Anyone??
[13:44:43] <raj> hex20dec, include jquery
[13:44:58] <hex20dec> It's included
[13:45:15] <Velveeta> not in that jsbin
[13:45:16] <hex20dec> I forgot to add it in the example
[13:45:21] <hex20dec> Yeah, sorry.
[13:46:45] <raj> hex20dec, cuz jqXHR.getAllResponseHeaders() is ''
[13:47:50] <ShawnRisk> jphase: back
[13:47:56] <hex20dec> raj: Is what??
[13:48:15] <raj> an empty string
[13:48:58] <hex20dec> raj: Well, that's exactly the point, why are the headers an empty string
[13:49:03] <hex20dec> I want the headers
[13:49:22] <hex20dec> raj: Do you have a better way to retrieve the headers?
[13:53:31] <duch_kazatel> hex20dec i think you're confused - jsonp means you won't get headers.
[13:53:49] <duch_kazatel> jsonp basically inserts a script tag on your page.  therefore, there are no headers in jxXHR
[13:53:52] <duch_kazatel> *jqXHR
[13:54:18] <hex20dec> Hmm... duch_kazatel. Aright, so what do I do in this case?
[13:54:26] <duch_kazatel> why do you need the headers?
[13:54:38] <duch_kazatel> or rather, what problem are you trying to solve?
[13:54:52] <hex20dec> It has the remaining queries available per clientid for the hour
[13:54:53] <hex20dec> I need it
[13:55:01] <duch_kazatel> why use jsonp then?
[13:55:11] <hex20dec> Because that's the only one that works.
[13:55:17] <hex20dec> According to instagram api
[13:55:49] <hex20dec> http://instagram.com/developer/endpoints/#
[13:55:52] <hex20dec> Go to the bottom
[13:55:59] <hex20dec> duch_kazatel:
[13:56:17] <duch_kazatel> nope.
[13:56:31] <duch_kazatel> that says  just says you can use jsonp
[13:56:38] <duch_kazatel> "If you're writing an AJAX application, and you'd like to wrap our response with a callback, all you have to do is specify a callback parameter with any API call:"\
[13:57:08] <hex20dec> Well, regardless, I tried without specifying a datatype to jsonp and I kept getting parse error
[13:57:19] <duch_kazatel> what was the parse error?
[13:57:26] <hex20dec> Syntax parse error
[13:57:40] <duch_kazatel> that means you were parsing it incorrectly.
[13:57:46] <hex20dec> I didn't do anything
[13:57:48] <duch_kazatel> if you use jsonp, you cannot get headers.
[13:57:50] <hex20dec> I'll show you
[13:58:01] <duch_kazatel> wonderful!  jsfiddle is baller.
[13:58:34] <hex20dec> duch_kazatel: If you would just  remove the datatype from the ajax
[13:58:37] <hex20dec> You will see what I mean
[13:58:41] <hex20dec> And look at the inspector
[13:58:46] <duch_kazatel> i don't have the fiddle up still, please resend.
[13:58:48] <hex20dec> You will not get a response
[13:58:57] <hex20dec> http://jsbin.com/mage/1/edit
[13:59:25] <ShawnRisk> jphase: still around?
[13:59:28] <hex20dec> Oh, I need to add jquery.. sorry
[13:59:33] <pilou44> Hello, I want to use jquery into a twig template of symfony 2
[13:59:41] <hex20dec> But that wasn't the problem... in case you're wondering
[13:59:44] <pilou44> I load javascript at the end of my template
[14:00:08] <pilou44> so I can't use $(document).ready since jquery is not downloaded yet
[14:00:11] <pilou44> how can i do ?
[14:00:14] <pilou44> thanks
[14:00:21] <duch_kazatel> you need to put your code after you load jquery
[14:00:46] <duch_kazatel> hex20dec http://jsbin.com/mage/8/edit
[14:03:01] <hex20dec> duch_kazatel: FF and Chrome won't parse it, Opera does.. And I guess jsbin does as well with however they are sending the data
[14:03:07] <hex20dec> But try it locally
[14:03:11] <hex20dec> On FF
[14:03:18] <duch_kazatel> hex20dec did you look at your console?
[14:03:46] <hex20dec> I did
[14:03:52] <hex20dec> Nothing.
[14:04:07] <duch_kazatel> I see an error.
[14:04:28] <hex20dec> I see the error in the respose section
[14:04:34] <hex20dec> on the network tab
[14:04:38] <natas_> what error do you see duch_kazatel
[14:04:57] <hex20dec> syntaxError: JSON.parse: unexpected end of data
[14:05:06] <duch_kazatel> in firebug I see that the object has a statusText="error"
[14:06:25] <natas_> but statusText error, that's the response from json right? just means it failed somehow?
[14:06:47] <duch_kazatel> dunno what their API docs say, but that sounds about right.
[14:10:40] <ShawnRisk> decx: is there a way to search the logs as I want to find something but can't remember which date
[14:14:56] <ShawnRisk> should I use this: window.pageYOffset, which is going to be different in each browser depending on toolbars etc., or should I take from the body or content div?  If this is body or content div, should the jquery look like $('body').pageYOffset?
[14:15:02] <ShooterMG> when I call jquery.ajax, is it possible to parse the data myself instead of having jquery do it? i believe it's failing on parsing
[14:17:52] <zeroquake> hello , i am trying to create a 3 column table and populate with some json data - i am stuck on how to iterate properly and get the data displayed properly .Here is the JSfiddle for it http://jsfiddle.net/fnqpn/2/ , any help ?
[14:19:33] <ShawnRisk> ShooterMG: well myself depends on your code
[14:20:22] <ShooterMG> ShawnRisk: i think my problem is that i'm never getting success called, and I think it's because it's not parsing the return data correctly....i'd like to somehow get at this return data myself and see what's going on
[14:20:41] <ShawnRisk> okay
[14:21:19] <ShawnRisk> zeroquake: I thought tables were gone and css was used now.
[14:22:37] <zeroquake> i thik tables are simplest way to do this , plus i dot have to worry about resizig if i used div , not to metion the css required for positioning 3 columns properly side by side
[14:22:52] <zeroquake> *if i used tables.
[14:23:08] <ShawnRisk> zeroquake: with float?
[14:23:40] <Velveeta> or inline-block
[14:23:51] <Velveeta> tables aren't gone, but they are considered outdated for layout purposes
[14:24:03] <duch_kazatel> fuck that: position: absolute; clear: left;
[14:24:10] <duch_kazatel> position like a man and do it yourself.
[14:24:21] <duch_kazatel> don't let the browser make any decisions for you.
[14:24:24] <duch_kazatel> blam
[14:24:37] <Velveeta> shootermg: i think you can request it w/ dataType: 'text' and then run it through parseJSON yourself
[14:24:55] <ShooterMG> ahh ok, i'll try parseJSON then, thanks
[14:25:21] <ShooterMG> oh woops
[14:25:29] <ShooterMG> setting the dataType as 'text' still causes an error
[14:25:36] <ShawnRisk> any ideas to my question?
[14:25:42] <duch_kazatel> ShooterMG do you have a jsfiddle that we can all see in actio?
[14:25:51] <zeroquake> so , i create a div for each column list --- then use use position absolute - clear left for all three?
[14:26:02] <duch_kazatel> zeroquake I was being facetious.
[14:26:05] <duch_kazatel> don't actually do that.
[14:26:12] <ShooterMG> i'll set one up
[14:26:58] <zeroquake> hmm , how do you think i  should go about this?
[14:28:25] <ShawnRisk> :(
[14:28:38] <motaka2> what is the difference between array.prototype.push.call and Array.push.call
[14:30:14] <ShawnRisk> should I use this: window.pageYOffset, which is going to be different in each browser depending on toolbars etc., or should I take from the body or content div?  If this is body or content div, should the jquery look like $('body').pageYOffset?
[14:36:33] <duch_kazatel> ShawnRisk does $('element').offset().top not work?
[14:37:19] <ShooterMG> ahh derp, my ajax problem is cross-domain related
[14:37:24] <ShooterMG> n/m  :P
[14:39:12] <ShawnRisk> duch_kazatel: wouldn't be good in this situation as I am already using that and the math would be crazy to do that
[14:39:33] <duch_kazatel> ShawnRisk do you want the element's vertical offset from the body?
[14:39:53] <ShawnRisk> yes
[14:40:00] <ShawnRisk> might work let me try
[14:40:08] <duch_kazatel> that's exactly what that does
[14:41:36] <dogmatic69> anyone know of a plugin that does facebook like gallery thumbnails that scroll on mouseover?
[14:41:55] <ButtDog> Any idea why I can't get the overall? http://pastebin.com/v0Y3dHrK I think it's a scope issue.
[14:42:19] <duch_kazatel> "can't get the overall" from where?
[14:42:45] <ButtDog> sum = sum + data.progress;
[14:43:03] <duch_kazatel> wat
[14:43:07] <duch_kazatel> reformulate the question.
[14:43:13] <ButtDog> I think maybe it's outside the scope? when I try over = sum / items.progress
[14:43:29] <ButtDog> I'm trying to add to the total sum each for each progress div
[14:43:36] <ButtDog> then divide that sum by the number of divs
[14:43:42] <ButtDog> and get the overall progress.
[14:43:46] <duch_kazatel> so you're having an issue with sum and items?
[14:44:01] <ButtDog> Ya, exactly
[14:44:19] <duch_kazatel> what error are you getting?
[14:44:28] <duch_kazatel> because the scope looks fine.
[14:44:41] <ButtDog> I'm not getting any error the sum is 0
[14:45:09] <ButtDog> when I do alert(sum) inside that jaquery ajax function I can get a number but when I call it outsie it's 0
[14:45:31] <MrChairman> Why does my function return undefined: http://pastie.org/8702913
[14:46:04] <duch_kazatel> ButtDog your scoping looks fine.  check the value you data.progress
[14:46:07] <duch_kazatel> *of
[14:46:28] <ButtDog> http://pastebin.com/T1CyKjwm
[14:46:30] <jlucas> MrChairman.  Which function are you referring to?  You have a function nested inside another function.
[14:47:05] <duch_kazatel> ButtDog try console.logging sum before you increment items
[14:47:21] <MrChairman> jlucas: i want the outside function to return t or f based on the inside function
[14:47:38] <ButtDog> On line 12?
[14:47:42] <duch_kazatel> sure.
[14:48:04] <MrChairman> jlucas: but if I just return $.get(), it returns an object
[14:49:02] <ButtDog> I don't see anything in the console when I do
[14:49:23] <duch_kazatel> what does that tell you?
[14:49:47] <ButtDog> But Alert does?
[14:49:54] <duch_kazatel> try alerting instead.
[14:50:48] <ButtDog> Sorry, console log works
[14:50:55] <duch_kazatel> and what does it say?
[14:50:58] <ButtDog> It returns 17
[14:51:42] <duch_kazatel> and then a console.log of sum right before line 15 returns 0?
[14:52:05] <duch_kazatel> sounds like a race condition maybe?  hrm.
[14:52:21] <ButtDog> Ya, exactly
[14:52:54] <ButtDog> Are you sure my scope is correct?
[14:53:44] <MrChairman> jlucas: I goofed, .get will always return a request object, there is a success callback function
[14:54:22] <duch_kazatel> ButtDog yes.  you're using closures
[14:54:41] <duch_kazatel> variables defined in a parent scope are available in child scopes.
[14:56:41] <ShawnRisk> duch_kazatel: I will figure this out later thanks for helping.
[14:57:29] <ButtDog> dutch_kazatel: Any ideas?
[15:00:30] <H3bus> hi guys, can someone tell me what this expression does :             $view = $('view', xml); ? Knowing that $view is unitialized before, and xml contains a xml content ?
[15:02:05] <jlucas> MrChairman you will need to set a variable and access that outside your functions.
[15:09:04] <MrChairman> jlucas: i tried this and it returns "test" http://pastie.org/8702977
[15:10:21] <MrChairman> I must be using .get() wrong
[15:11:22] <GuffyJarvis> I got a design question - i've got a div that contains what could be one or many lines of text - when you hover over a div, it appears next to your mouse. What would be the best way to handle presenting that? I tried a marquee-like approach but it seems overblown. is just making it a scrollable container my only other choice? It's all i can think of
[15:11:36] <jphase> MrChairman: you don't look like you're sending any data there?
[15:11:59] <jlucas> MyChairman  You are using it correctly, but you are not setting your variable correctly.
[15:12:15] <MrChairman> How should I set that variable?
[15:12:41] <jlucas> you need to set "var result = true;" within your inner function call
[15:13:32] <FriendlySeal> omfg haize

[15:15:34] <FriendlySeal> im not joking

[15:15:52] <FriendlySeal> wen i click inspect element
[15:15:58] <FriendlySeal> open or not

[15:16:35] <FriendlySeal> also try telling ur customer that

[15:16:37] <FriendlySeal> moron
[15:16:41] <jphase> you're a nub
[15:16:43] <FriendlySeal> ya ok
[15:17:00] <FriendlySeal> omfg stay on the subject
[15:17:06] <FriendlySeal> what OS?
[15:17:25] <jphase> .slideToggle is a mac related function? no... it's a jQuery function that uses js therefore works based 100% on browser capability, which should even work in IE6
[15:17:34] <jphase> so before you start running your mouth calling people an idiot, RTFM
[15:17:45] <FriendlySeal> stfu already if cant fix
[15:17:52] <jphase> I can't fix stupid
[15:17:54] <jphase> sorry
[15:17:57] <FriendlySeal> i stated my issues
[15:18:08] <FriendlySeal> hide or slidetogle not working on mac
[15:18:23] <FriendlySeal> but works after i click inspect element
[15:18:30] <FriendlySeal> so fkn weird
[15:19:21] <jphase> FriendlySeal: do you see "Nub" on the screen on this link:   http://jsfiddle.net/jphase/qQ7Jh/  ?
[15:19:41] <MrChairman> maybe its returning result before .get request is finished
[15:19:49] <MrChairman> so I'll try wrapping it in an if statement
[15:20:05] <jphase> cause I'm on mac, tried in chrome, firefox, safari, and opera and it all hides the word "Nub", therefore .hide() most definitely works on Mac
[15:20:11] <jphase> check your console for errors
[15:23:59] <FriendlySeal> wow still not working
[15:24:11] <FriendlySeal> i even changed the selector to #wtf
[15:24:40] <jphase> FriendlySeal: can you see the element on my jsfiddle or is it hidden?
[15:24:49] <FriendlySeal> hiden
[15:25:12] <jphase> then there must be some sort of error in your code, do you have any errors or a clean console?
[15:25:41] <FriendlySeal> no err
[15:32:33] <jphase> FriendlySeal: the only thing I can think of is that you have some whack browser plugin/extension installed. try disabling your plugins, clearing your cache/saved data, and doing a hard refresh
[15:32:50] <FriendlySeal> i did a hard shutdown
[15:33:08] <jphase> delete browser cache and disable whatever plugins/extensions you have installed on your browser
[15:33:51] <FriendlySeal> hahaha works on mac in FF
[15:34:00] <FriendlySeal> maybe safari is tard
[15:34:23] <jphase> 100% of jQuery/js is browser specific, so definitely nothing to do with your OS
[15:35:18] <FriendlySeal> ok relax einstein
[15:35:31] <FriendlySeal> its gota be the developer plugin in safari
[15:35:46] <jphase> FriendlySeal: my suggestion to you is stop being an asshole and calling people idiots and you might just get help and learn something for a change
[15:35:47] <FriendlySeal> since it starts working when i click inspect element
[15:35:53] <FriendlySeal> or show console
[15:35:59] <jphase> you have quite the pissy attitude for 2 days straight now, rather annoying
[15:35:59] <FriendlySeal> shut up idiot
[15:36:04] <FriendlySeal> u havent helped shit
[15:36:18] <jphase> well, sorry you think that "slideToggle" is broken on mac
[15:36:22] <jphase> lol
[15:36:25] <FriendlySeal> doood
[15:36:27] <jphase> eat a bag of dicks and learn to code
[15:36:28] <duch_kazatel> woah.
[15:36:34] <duch_kazatel> this is awesome.
[15:36:40] <duch_kazatel> i'll grab some popcorn.
[15:36:45] <FriendlySeal> im dignosing my issue incase others have this
[15:37:12] <FriendlySeal> or telling this chanel
[15:37:30] <FriendlySeal> ya obviously its not slidetoggle on mac
[15:37:30] <jphase> that's fine, don't be offensive and a shithead to people in the channel while doing it and we're all good
[15:37:47] <FriendlySeal> otherwise jq wudnt be shipping for mac assclown
[15:37:58] <FriendlySeal> but its not working w whatever i got setup here
[15:38:17] <FriendlySeal> no u started going apeshit
[15:38:19] <shoky> enough with the cussing please
[15:38:21] <jphase> god, you're a total infant, I bet you use w3schools
[15:38:29] <FriendlySeal> see
[15:38:32] <FriendlySeal> there it is again
[15:38:56] <FriendlySeal> getin all crazy
[15:39:02] <jphase> FriendlySeal: you're the one that started calling names, just like yesterday - and everyone here can attest to that lol
[15:39:06] <shoky> leave it be
[15:39:09] <FriendlySeal> so its a joke lol
[15:39:15] <jphase> well so is your face
[15:39:19] <jphase> and your coding skills </rant>
[15:39:22] <FriendlySeal> so is ur mom
[15:39:47] <FriendlySeal> my coding skills broke safari?
[15:39:57] <jphase> no, safari works just fine lol
[15:39:59] <FriendlySeal> ur such a nub
[15:40:02] <jphase> works for me and everyone else that uses it
[15:40:05] <jphase> slideToggle, hide, etc.
[15:40:11] <jphase> works beautfully in safari
[15:40:42] <jphase> and every other jQuery function for that matter
[15:42:48] <FriendlySeal> ok well the simple fiddle works
[15:42:56] <FriendlySeal> w slidetoggle
[15:46:29] <FriendlySeal> but who ever doubted that
[15:55:47] <andrewSC> hi all
[15:56:12] <andrewSC> /join #chromium
[15:56:15] <andrewSC> damnit
[15:57:26] <FriendlySeal> no dood
[15:57:30] <FriendlySeal> chromium sux
[15:57:50] <FriendlySeal> its all about iceweasel
[15:58:33] <FriendlySeal> jphase, !!!!!!!!
[15:58:38] <FriendlySeal> MONKEYYYYYY
[15:58:43] <FriendlySeal> u there budy
[15:58:44] <andrewSC> i mean, it's such a specific question
[15:58:46] <andrewSC> haha
[15:58:48] <andrewSC> :(
[15:58:52] <FriendlySeal> coz i jus updated safari and it works
[15:58:58] * jphase != FriendlySeal's buddy
[15:59:06] <FriendlySeal> I THOT everything works purfectly
[15:59:12] <FriendlySeal> and its not OS
[15:59:17] <FriendlySeal> or shit like that
[15:59:22] <andrewSC> basically i set an event listener on window for onPopState and it's firing when the page loads in chrome but not FF
[15:59:25] <FriendlySeal> guess what u fkn nub
[15:59:28] <andrewSC> haven't tried safari yet
[15:59:34] <FriendlySeal> safari is not an OS
[15:59:46] <FriendlySeal> but its closely tied to it
[15:59:53] <FriendlySeal> and uses os components
[16:00:24] <FriendlySeal> so stop acting like ur fkn jules vern over here
[16:00:30] <FriendlySeal> and stfu
[16:00:57] <snover> you’re seriously the worst troll ever
[16:01:09] <FriendlySeal> at least i know wtf im saying
[16:01:20] <FriendlySeal> unlike some
[16:01:25] <FriendlySeal> teling me its my code
[16:01:38] <FriendlySeal> perhaps mac update updated my code too huh
[16:01:40] <andrewSC> wow
[16:01:48] <andrewSC> tool to the max
[16:01:54] <FriendlySeal> those nsa quacks sure are skillful
[16:02:30] <FriendlySeal> anyhow like i said from begining
[16:02:49] <FriendlySeal> i must have been the dev plugin thingie

[16:15:24] <FriendlySeal> all efects
[16:15:50] <duch_kazatel> like animations?
[16:15:59] <vinex08> no, safari cant handle your coding skills
[16:16:45] <duch_kazatel> safari definitely can
[16:16:48] <duch_kazatel> webkit and all that,
[16:17:19] <FriendlySeal> vinex08, scroll up foo
[16:17:35] <FriendlySeal> part where updating safari fixed my issue

[16:28:20] <vinex08> now
[16:41:14] <aberrant> hi all
[16:41:37] <aberrant> can someone please tell me how I add text to an input button with id="r1"?
[16:42:02] <aberrant> that is, I have <input id="r1" type="radio" name="squelch"><br/>
[16:42:23] <aberrant> I want to add text after the input button. I've tried ${"#r1").html(), but that doesn't work
[16:42:30] <duch_kazatel> after the button?
[16:42:35] <decx> a radiobutton has only a value and can be checker or unchecked
[16:42:37] <aberrant> well, associated with the button.
[16:42:46] <aberrant> I need the button labeled.
[16:42:59] <decx> <label><input>Text</label>
[16:43:04] <aberrant> Like here: http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_forms.asp
[16:43:12] <aberrant> <input type="radio" name="sex" value="male">Male<br>
[16:43:25] <decx> that isnt userfriendly aberrant
[16:43:40] <aberrant> decx: how should radio buttons be labeled?
[16:43:41] <decx> you want you label text to count as a click on the input
[16:43:50] <aberrant> oh, ok
[16:43:58] <decx> <label><input type="radio">Text</label>
[16:44:04] <aberrant> got it. Thanks.
[16:44:07] <decx> if you hate yourself you can use for
[16:44:24] <decx> <label for="r1>text</label><input id="r1">
[16:44:37] <aberrant> ah.
[16:44:47] <decx> but wrapping makes much more sense anyway
[16:45:02] <decx> so unless you have to have your label and button separately, always wrap
[16:45:08] <aberrant> <label id="l1"><input id="r1" type="radio" name="squelch"></label>
[16:45:15] <aberrant> like that?
[16:45:22] <decx> you cant use an id more than once
[16:45:27] <aberrant> right
[16:45:40] <aberrant> <label id="l2"><input id="r2" type="radio" name="squelch"><br/></label>
[16:45:42] <aberrant> etc.
[16:46:07] <decx> something like that yes
[16:47:00] <aberrant> that's not displaying the radio buttons.
[16:47:31] <aberrant> http://dpaste.com/1587734/
[16:49:29] <aberrant> I'm not sure this will work, having the labels wrap the inputs.
[16:50:55] <duch_kazatel> you can do that.
[16:51:12] <aberrant> duch_kazatel: it's not displaying the radio buttons.
[16:51:19] <duch_kazatel> have a fiddle?
[16:51:31] <aberrant> just a dpaste: http://dpaste.com/1587734/
[16:52:35] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/kGUpu/
[16:52:38] <duch_kazatel> displays just fine.
[16:52:56] <aberrant> oh, <input> needs a closing tag?
[16:53:27] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/kGUpu/2/
[16:53:32] <duch_kazatel> renders without, too.
[16:54:23] <duch_kazatel> oh looks like the spec says they can't have an end tag.
[16:55:23] <aberrant> ok
[16:55:27] <aberrant> I think I found the issue
[16:55:36] <duch_kazatel> but yeah, wrapping with a label doesn't break anything.
[16:55:41] <aberrant> if I try to modify $("#l1").html() the buttons disappear
[16:55:44] <sunbeam> is there a on zoom out function in jquery?
[16:56:15] <duch_kazatel> aberrant that's because you're replacing the content of $('#l1')
[16:56:25] <aberrant> duch_kazatel: I just want a label for the radio button :)
[16:56:28] <vinex08> ist this the correct way to do it? <label for="r1>text</label><input id="r1" />
[16:56:41] <duch_kazatel> vinex08 that's one way yoou can do it.
[16:56:58] <aberrant> oh.
[16:56:58] <duch_kazatel> sunbeam nope.
[16:57:04] <vinex08> i guess that's much better and 'semantically ' correct?
[16:57:13] <duch_kazatel> not necessarily
[16:57:17] <duch_kazatel> it's a different way to do it.
[16:57:21] <decx> wrapping makes more sense
[16:57:47] <decx> because who really wants to make a for="" for every label, cmon
[16:57:57] <decx> i have some dignity
[16:58:03] <vinex08> lol
[16:58:08] <duch_kazatel> hahahaha
[16:58:15] <aberrant> vinex08: that worked.
[16:58:51] <decx> vinex08 i looked at your fiddle
[16:59:01] <decx> you're overthinking
[16:59:10] <vinex08> in stack>
[16:59:10] <vinex08> ?
[16:59:25] <decx> i looked at http://jsfiddle.net/czW8z/2/
[16:59:54] <vinex08> I guess i am overthinking
[16:59:57] <decx> compare that with http://jsfiddle.net/decx/czW8z/10/
[17:00:09] <duch_kazatel> hahahaha
[17:00:27] <decx> oh i even had a superflous var in there
[17:00:27] <smizell> I'm not really for sure how to ask this... I'm trying to find out all of the links of a selector excluding the any links from that same selector. Here is an example HTML file with an quick explanation: https://gist.github.com/smizell/9105d7e6d1a643d8883e
[17:00:31] <duch_kazatel> even better: text-overflow: ellipsis;
[17:00:42] <decx> http://jsfiddle.net/decx/czW8z/11/
[17:00:56] <decx> i like the concept of text-overflow: ellipsis
[17:01:07] <decx> but somehow it just doesn't click
[17:01:13] <duch_kazatel> instead of the excerbt,.
[17:01:17] <duch_kazatel> *excerpt
[17:01:21] <decx> what of all the truncate functions i wrote for smarty? ;)
[17:01:31] <decx> in*
[17:01:37] <duch_kazatel> hahahaha
[17:02:03] <wunz> hi, i'm trying to dynamic get an object value based on array text: http://jsfiddle.net/2tRhg/8/ --> doing the q.a[i]; doesn't seem to be able to call something like q.Name
[17:02:20] <vinex08> woahh who made those fiddles
[17:02:24] <wunz> what is the best way of doing that so i don't have to do 10+ .replace on the string?
[17:02:26] <duch_kazatel> wunz woah.
[17:02:34] <vinex08> went up to 11
[17:02:44] <decx> i updated 2 and got 10
[17:02:54] <decx> somebody fiddled in the dark
[17:02:59] <wunz> duch_kazatel: what's up?
[17:03:09] <duch_kazatel> wunz what are you trying to do?
[17:03:38] <wunz> i want to replace strings with the actual value from the json object q
[17:04:35] <wunz> so rather than doing h.replace("q.Name", q.Name).replace("q.symbol", q.symbol); i was trying to be smart about it and do it in a loop
[17:04:58] <decx> you want a simple templating engine
[17:05:33] <vinex08> thanks man! now ill go to wordpress  XD
[17:07:53] <m4rtijn> hi
[17:08:42] <duch_kazatel> yeah i'd look at a templating engine at that point.
[17:09:02] <m4rtijn> i have a silly question.. i guess
[17:09:04] <m4rtijn> http://pastie.org/8703199
[17:09:13] <wunz> duch_kazatel: it'd be too much for this small task to use a templating engine
[17:09:31] <m4rtijn> where i pasted my_initial_this -- how would I get that there?
[17:10:00] <m4rtijn> i need the parent of the link i clicked to fire the ajax.. but im lost in scopes..
[17:10:11] <wunz> templating engine i think would be overkill for a stocks display
[17:10:18] <m4rtijn> line 21
[17:11:27] <decx> wunz http://ejohn.org/blog/javascript-micro-templating/
[17:11:32] <duch_kazatel> thank you.
[17:11:50] <wunz> m4rtijn: i'm a bit confused, can you rephrase that question
[17:12:25] <wunz> you need the parent of the button clicked to fire the ajax call?
[17:12:38] <m4rtijn> yes.. but in the success function
[17:12:57] <m4rtijn> I think
[17:15:04] <m4rtijn> or do I have to get out of the success function scope first?
[17:15:22] <vinex08> decx: http://jsfiddle.net/czW8z/12/  your comments?
[17:15:57] <wunz> decx: thanks, very neat.
[17:16:03] <decx> getting fancy with a return there, well done
[17:16:11] <smizell> If you are wanting to exclude elements, is it quicker to do a .not() or .clone().remove()?
[17:17:02] <m4rtijn> wunz: did you get what I meant?
[17:17:22] <wunz> m4rtijn: that's not how it works... you're currently making an ajax call once the button is clicked
[17:17:38] <wunz> then you want it to make that same call again after it was success?
[17:17:43] <wunz> then you want it to make that same call again after it was successful*?
[17:18:15] <m4rtijn> no.. I just need to add data to a div .. the div is a child of the parent of the button I clicked
[17:18:36] <m4rtijn> so.. in the success function.. i need a reference to my button
[17:19:09] <duch_kazatel> m4rtijn save that reference at the top of your click handler, then reference that when you need it.
[17:20:30] <wunz> you don't necessary have to put it at the top of your click handler since you can still use the selector
[17:21:09] <duch_kazatel> sure, but if he's doing it against a class, that'll give him what he wants/.
[17:21:44] <m4rtijn> duch_kazatel: i shortened my pastie.. how would I do that in this example?
[17:21:45] <m4rtijn> http://pastie.org/8703212
[17:21:47] <wunz> m4rtijn: show some html code that contains the parents, child, and button
[17:22:12] <m4rtijn> wunz: i have a lot of equal classes - so i cant pick it
[17:22:39] <wunz> paste the snippet of that area, better so we can see it
[17:23:04] <duch_kazatel> http://pastie.org/8703216
[17:23:13] <duch_kazatel> something like that.
[17:23:58] <m4rtijn> ah, ok.. so that will be available in the scope of that function
[17:24:02] <m4rtijn> cheers, i will try that
[17:24:44] <duch_kazatel> m4rtijn your question has nothing to do with scope, btw.
[17:25:09] <duch_kazatel> well, at least not in the way you think it does.
[17:25:39] <m4rtijn> duch_kazatel: o
[17:26:04] <m4rtijn> duch_kazatel: I was hittin on $(this) which was a scope issue.. but you are right
[17:27:24] <m4rtijn> it worked.. thanks duch_kazatel and wunz
[17:32:14] <wunz> i take no credit, it was all duch_kazatel - i was actually referring you to use the selector again but he proposed a better solution
[17:41:33] <FriendlySeal> duch_kazatel, is a prety kool kid
[17:52:31] <torbjorn> how can I check if all inupts of a selection are empty, ie have value ""
[17:54:17] <FriendlySeal> .each probly
[17:56:23] <torbjorn> yeah, im setting a var to false if val != "" in an each
[17:59:36] <decx> what's the endgame here? why not just $(selector).val('') if you want to empty every input?
[18:00:01] <FriendlySeal> he is checking it
[18:00:21] <FriendlySeal> its like in_array
[18:00:50] <decx> i dont get it, then again it's 3am
[18:00:57] <decx> gn
[18:01:05] <FriendlySeal> lool
[18:01:25] <FriendlySeal> every1 on irc acts like a doctor
[18:01:27] <FriendlySeal> lol
[18:02:13] <decx> well here's hoping that my doctor goes to bed early
[18:02:51] <FriendlySeal> its just time lol
[18:02:57] <FriendlySeal> it doesnt exist
[18:03:10] <FriendlySeal> unless u plan on hybernating
[18:03:30] <FriendlySeal> but ya the body does react to sunlight
[18:03:45] <FriendlySeal> so being a niteowl wil reflect on ur health
[18:04:48] <decx> who's playing doctor now?
[18:05:49] <FriendlySeal> me
[18:27:19] <sunbeam> how to detect if browser zoom is at 50%?
[18:40:53] <prbc> does someone here have experience with the select2 plugin?
[19:21:00] <FriendlySeal> wow
[19:21:06] <FriendlySeal> so much for using frameworks
[19:21:24] <FriendlySeal> framwork != ""
[19:21:28] <FriendlySeal> duuuuuur
[19:21:57] <FriendlySeal> i thot i was the only one not checking empty strings
[19:23:49] <igcewieling> I'm a bit of JS/jQuery n00b.   I've been reading up on form validation plugins, but I don't see much mention of field interdependence.  handling complex field interdependence is why I'
[19:24:06] <igcewieling> m looking at a form plugin.  Does anyone have wisdom on the topc?
[19:26:42] <igcewieling> I don't even know where to begin looking
[19:30:27] <monk3y> igcewieling: I'm an 'intermediate n00b' - what do you mean by field interdepence?  You mean dynamic display or validation of fields based on the value of others?
[19:31:15] <FriendlySeal> he wants to like validate based on other fields validate
[19:31:27] <FriendlySeal> and i think he will have to do some coding
[19:31:40] <FriendlySeal> instead of just using otherses plugins
[19:31:55] <FriendlySeal> and stop being such a lazy bastard
[19:35:03] <igcewieling> monk3y: indeed I do mean that (I think).    The application is an interface for a cluster of telephone switches, but the application does not matter.  For example if a specific field has the string "fax" then a whole bunch of fields are disabled.   If there is the string "rcf/" in one of the fields than a bunch of other fields are disabled, etc.   All that works spiffy until I put in "fax" and "rcf/" and the field gets re-enabled when 
[19:36:10] <monk3y> FriendlySeal: heheh with that kind of response I wouldn't like to see you when you're *not* friendly.
[19:36:27] <FriendlySeal> O_________O
[19:36:31] <igcewieling> I was thinking of all complicated ways and then thought "I can't be the first person wanting to do this"
[19:37:01] <FriendlySeal> igcewieling, rnt u a nub
[19:37:13] <FriendlySeal> and cud use the exp
[19:37:17] <FriendlySeal> erience
[19:37:34] <igcewieling> FriendlySeal: coding all the interdependence is why I'm looking at a plugin.
[19:37:55] <FriendlySeal> why not just get a job recruiting
[19:37:58] <FriendlySeal> :\
[19:38:03] <FriendlySeal> they cud use the help
[19:38:21] <igcewieling> hmm?
[19:38:40] <FriendlySeal> only 1000 recruiters email me daily
[19:38:47] <FriendlySeal> shud be a million

[19:42:35] <igcewieling> jamesarm97: thank you!
[19:46:33] <igcewieling> I found http://jqueryvalidation.org/ last night but seemed like interdependence would be almost as complicated as not using a plugin.
[19:48:53] <jamesarm97> yeah, that doesn't look like what you want. Mainly validates fields when you click the submit button from what I can tell.
[20:00:27] <igcewieling> jamesarm97: most of the validation plugins I've seen are similar.
[20:01:50] <igcewieling> even at my relatively low skill level in JS stuff I thought most of them didn't do much I could not do better myself.
[20:40:09] <MrChairman> http://pastie.org/8703523 <-- Why does this return an empty result. Its like the closure does not have access to result

[20:49:21] <SvperPhly> Hey folks, I'm having some problems selecting a sibling value of a selected json value...
[20:49:40] <Whiskey> FriendlySeal: any idee how i get that link whit text inside that div? http://jsfiddle.net/TE4wB/
[20:50:13] <FriendlySeal> .html()
[20:50:39] <Whiskey> just .html()?
[20:52:07] <FriendlySeal> u srs
[20:52:20] <MrChairman> i fixed it
[20:53:00] <MrChairman> If a function is asynchronous, the parses just calls the function and moves on to the next thing until the result is back ?
[20:55:21] <Whiskey> FriendlySeal: hehe, sorry i was a bit unclear, i mean the textfile the text that is on that link in that div :)
[20:56:53] <Whiskey> FriendlySeal: the content in the diev, not the link :D
[20:58:46] <kevireilly> SvperPhly: what is the problem? can you provide example json?
[21:01:17] <SvperPhly> jsfiddle.net/rLPtS
[21:02:19] <SvperPhly> i need to output "Under 13"... or whatever "group" is based on the id
[21:02:36] <SvperPhly> you can kinda see what i'm _TRYING_ to do at the bottom, but apparently that doesn't make sense.
[21:02:48] <SvperPhly> I was also trying to avoid doing a bunch of loops.
[21:04:03] <SvperPhly> kevireilly: that code probably won't work the way it is at all... not real sure how jsfiddle works
[21:04:49] <kevireilly> SvperPhly: i'm peeping. Seems the json definition is causing an error. You should probably also be using `var` in front of those variable definitions (unlikely the issue)
[21:09:36] <FriendlySeal> its a coding nitemaer
[21:13:12] <kevireilly> SvperPhly: yeah im not sure about how to best go about this without parsing and iterating, but here is a working version http://jsfiddle.net/rLPtS/1/

[21:34:47] <SvperPhly> kevireilly: hey man, thanks... that actually solved my problem perfectly.
[21:35:12] <SvperPhly> it also made me understand this stuff better. there's such elegant ways to do things....... and then there's the way I do them :/
[21:41:29] <monk3y> igcewieling: did you make any progress with your interdependent field thingy-thing?
[21:43:21] <igcewieling> monk3y: I had "real work" which had to be done.   Using the .data() method I should be able to store validation information attached to elements
[21:44:05] <igcewieling> something to make sure the disabled property and classes are not removed until the last depending field says the element passes.
[21:45:40] <monk3y> Yeah I'm in the throes of real-work myself (hence giving my 1.5cents then ducking out on the final 0.5) .. but I thought high-level it would be a mix of $('#inputId1').on('click' .. [enable/disable input], and $('#inputId2').on('blur' .. [enable/disable] ..
[21:48:12] <igcewieling> I have home grown stuff which does some primitive validation.   If field A is empty then field B should be disabled, if field A has a value then field B should be enabled.   that is standard stuff.   Now imagine what might happen if field C is empty then field B should be disabled and when field C has a value then field B should be re-enabled.
[21:49:03] <igcewieling> what ends up happening is that the first field (A or C) to pass validation removes the disabled properties and classes from field C even though it should stay disabled because field C is still empty.   Does that make sense?
[21:49:30] <igcewieling> lets try that again: what ends up happening is that the first field (A or C) to pass validation removes the disabled properties and classes from field B even though it should stay disabled because field C is still empty.   Does that make sense?
[21:49:42] <monk3y> Yep; so you've got some complex dependencies; but as long as they're all internally consistent and never conflict, then it should be a few (hopefully shallow) if/thens, right?  Any more complex and you should look at a lean jQuery rules plugin.
[21:50:40] <monk3y> Hmm.  It's probably better for you if you put your logic in pseudo code in a pastebin or codepad (etc), then throw it in here.  Firstly the activity may map-out the if-then hierarchy for you, and secondly people here can see and fiddle with it.
[21:52:33] <igcewieling> the dependencies are complicated but I'll create a fiddle before I come back.
[21:53:05] <igcewieling> using .data() opens up a whole new horizon
[21:55:13] <monk3y> Cool.  Just writing out all the fields, and their logic/clauses statement by statement will help feed an if-then tree to see if it's viable.  I think I see what you're going to do with data-* .. but I'd want to know whether just watching the field's states and applying if/then/rules to them would be clearer to maintain.
[21:57:13] <igcewieling> monk3y: Using if/then/else is what I'm currently using.  It is terribly error prone.
[21:58:03] <monk3y> Yeah that's why I was saying that it would suffice up to a certain level of complexity (branches) .. but after a certain point you should use rules/a rule engine/plugin.
[21:59:03] <Whiskey> any idee how i get that link whit text inside that div, and not link i mean the content, and yes i konw you can do it cross-browser, but i will use a local link? http://jsfiddle.net/TE4wB/
[21:59:13] <igcewieling> monk3y: are you referring to something like http://jqueryvalidation.org/rules/
[21:59:51] <igcewieling> jquery validation is what I'll likely be using for the more simple validations
[22:00:46] <monk3y> Heh I *just* looked at that .. but no.  That seems to add superficial or simplistic rules to fields, but it doesn't look like you can do complex dependencies between two-or-more fields, and you'd have to run 'validate()' after every change/blur etc.
[22:01:09] <monk3y> (of course I could be overlooking something, I'm skimming quickly)
[22:01:46] <igcewieling> did you have any rules plugins in mind?
[22:04:57] <monk3y> Yeah I'm looking for things; but haven't found a swathe of links just yet.  I'm trying to find that silver-bullet in-between validation config and an if-then-else mess.
[22:05:33] <kevireilly> SvperPhly: no worries at all, it is all part of learning. Keep at it :)
[22:07:11] <monk3y> igcewieling: oOOOoohh @ https://github.com/miohtama/jquery-interdependencies
[22:07:34] <monk3y> (I didn't read it thoroughly, it just had the right keywords all over it)
[22:08:03] <monk3y> You did say you were shying away from plugins .. but it's this, or if-then-elses, or roll-your-own.
[22:08:03] <igcewieling> monk3y: Your Google-fu is strong.  I
[22:08:49] <monk3y> Heh thanks.  I don't think it'll get me out of a mugging, but it's 'fu' nonetheless.
[22:09:32] <FriendlySeal> whats fu
[22:09:38] <monk3y> igcewieling: if that doesn't suffice (difficult or over-engineering for your situation), the search-query I used was "jquery field dependency rules "
[22:09:52] <igcewieling> FriendlySeal: for this conversation "fu" == "skill"
[22:10:01] <FriendlySeal> ic
[22:10:25] <FriendlySeal> wana chek out new site im building
[22:10:28] <FriendlySeal> ?
[22:11:45] <FriendlySeal> argh i keep breaking stuf
[22:11:45] <Whiskey> http://jsfiddle.net/TE4wB/2/: I come up whit this but its not put the content in the div from the site, i use local site. this is just an example
[22:11:48] <FriendlySeal> as i change stuff
[22:11:53] <FriendlySeal> fukkkk
[22:11:57] <Whiskey> The get and return is 200 just fine
[22:16:16] <therealklanni> stop breaking shit

[22:17:06] * therealklanni slips back into the shadows silently
[22:17:48] <Whiskey> hmm did work fine, espect that it remove newlines and linebreak :/
[22:18:10] <jphase> mmm, your nick makes me thirsty
[22:18:34] <tw2113> isn't it spelled whisky?
[22:18:46] <jphase> not if you're already drunk I s'pose
[22:19:10] <tw2113> apparently it can go both ways
[22:19:30] <Whiskey> spelled?
[22:20:24] <FriendlySeal> its hard
[22:21:26] <Whiskey> yeh
[22:21:41] <tw2113> that's what she said
[22:23:50] <Whiskey> hate when stuff not works :/
[22:24:29] <FriendlySeal> wana chek out my site

[22:32:14] <FriendlySeal> ok i didnt wana show it anyway
[22:32:20] <FriendlySeal> fu gaize
[22:32:59] <Whiskey> everything works espect everything i try remove space and line breaks, but content is loaded fine
[22:54:35] <FriendlySeal> ahem
[22:59:16] <vinex08> heh
[23:03:40] <FriendlySeal> too hard
[23:03:50] <FriendlySeal> i dun wana coed
[23:06:41] * vinex08 farts..
[23:07:11] <vinex08> my fart will keep FriendlySeal away :)
[23:07:16] <vinex08> for a while
[23:48:08] <rasu> i add a iframe with fancybox and i need a function to run when i have loaded the iframe. is there any way to use .on() with event load or somthing similar
[23:48:30] <Cork> yes
[23:48:41] <Cork> bind .on('load') on the <iframe> element
[23:48:55] <Cork> but attach it before you set the src link
[23:52:11] <_rgn> I need a way for an instance of a "class" to communicate outside, should I extend the class with an event emitter or use callbacks as properties? myobj.onThisEvent = function() {}; etc.
[23:54:51] <Cork> _rgn: what do you mean communicate outside?
[23:55:04] <Cork> (context)
[23:56:05] <_rgn> I've instantiated the class and an event happens inside, and I need a way to propagate that information outside somehow
[23:56:12] <_rgn> with my own abstraction
[23:56:27] <rasu> i have tried this but it dosent work anybody knows why? $(document).on('load','iframe', function(){
[23:56:43] <Cork> _rgn: ok, what kind of info
[23:56:54] <Cork> element resize? user action? what?
[23:56:57] <_rgn> in this case, the class is an object that manages a div element, and it can have draggable objects inside, I want to be able know outside when something is dragged
[23:57:09] <Cork> ok
[23:57:16] <Cork> that sounds like a task for fake events
[23:57:29] <_rgn> with event emitters I would emit an event on the object instance and listen to those events outside
[23:57:42] <Cork> meaning .trigger('my-drag-event')
[23:58:14] <_rgn> something like that. but the instance doesn't have event functionality (not a jquery object)
[23:58:28] <Cork> rasu: load events doesn't bubble
[23:58:52] <Cork> _rgn: well do you know you have jquery at hand?
[23:59:00] <_rgn> yes, i have jquery
[23:59:04] <rasu> Cork: what do you mean bubble?
[23:59:22] <_rgn> should I have a dummy $({}) that is used for events?
[23:59:24] <Cork> _rgn: well then just trigger the event on the same element the drag happened on
[23:59:46] <Cork> _rgn: no the event should be on the widget or child of the widget
