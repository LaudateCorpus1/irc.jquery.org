[04:07:25] <al_nz1> Can anyone see why the attribute on line 42 is not enabling the button (but does enable the button in console) https://gist.github.com/bigalnz/09e3a93168fbdcae70bd138caa2d5a88
[04:07:47] <al_nz1> is it something to do with where the removeAttr command is placed in execution sequence>
[04:08:12] <Cork> don't use attr for state control use .prop
[04:08:22] <Cork> so .prop('disabled', false)
[04:08:25] <al_nz1> Cork: ah
[04:08:40] <Cork> actaully, don't use .attr unless it is broken with .prop()
[04:08:49] <Cork> (there are a few cases but they are very rare)
[04:09:16] <Cork> like getting the actual url from an <a> tag
[04:10:02] <al_nz1> is the disabled coded correctly in here :
[04:10:03] <al_nz1> <button type="button" class="btn btn-primary" id="btnSelectPerson" data-dismiss="modal" disabled>+ Selected Person</button>
[04:10:22] <Cork> yup
[04:11:31] <al_nz1> hmm, same issue
[04:11:42] <al_nz1> runs in console and enables, but not in code
[04:12:06] <Cork> put console.log($('the-selector').length); just before where you run it
[04:12:12] <Cork> it most likely is 0
[04:12:15] <Cork> or > 1
[04:12:37] <Cork> ah, wait you have ids you want $('[id="the-id"]').length
[04:12:47] <Cork> and if it is <> 1 you have html problem
[04:13:40] <Cork> (don't use that selector for anything other then debug though)
[04:14:11] <al_nz1> the html had to be disabled="disabled" - i just had disabled on its own
[04:21:05] <al_nz1> Cork: shouldn't I be using ids?
[04:21:12] <Cork> you should
[04:21:40] <al_nz1> ok
[04:31:24] <qrucial> hey. I am creating an element like this: $('<el></el>'); and storing it as a variable. I then attach an onclick event to it, and append the element to the page
[04:31:46] <qrucial> my click event fires first the first time I append the element to the page, but if i append it again later, it stops firing
[04:31:57] <qrucial> seems quite strange, any ideas?
[04:34:40] <thykka> qrucial, post some code to make it possible to debug
[04:35:58] <qrucial> lemme try to get some code that encompasses it properly
[04:39:13] <qrucial> this is kind of it: https://pastebin.com/1q8Cf5wi
[04:39:59] <qrucial> so I create an "unlockButton", assign the click. Later I call "Load Content", append the button and its clickable
[04:40:30] <qrucial> but if i LoadContent again, the on event stops firing
[04:43:18] <thykka> qrucial, removing an element from the DOM also removes any event listeners attached.
[04:43:36] <qrucial> hmm
[04:43:52] <thykka> qrucial, so either you'll need to reattach the listener every time you're reinserting the element in the DOM, OR you could use a delegate listener and things will just work
[04:44:44] <thykka> qrucial, consider this: $(document.body).on('click', '.unlockButton', () => { ... });
[04:44:56] <qrucial> my issue with a delegate listener is that then I wouldnt be able to attach the listened to a specific button
[04:45:10] <thykka> how so?
[04:45:12] <qrucial> since i will have many Page objects, each would have their own button
[04:46:09] <qrucial> it seems strange that the event listener gets removed, even if im keeping my own reference to the button
[04:46:17] <thykka> not sure if i'm following..
[04:47:27] <qrucial> I want clicking the button to call a method specific to that button. If i have a general delegated listener then I lose the ability to differenciate between them
[04:47:30] <qrucial> unless im thinking about this wrong
[04:48:44] <thykka> perhaps. Why does the method have to be specific? Why not have a generic method that does specific things based on it's context?
[04:49:22] <qrucial> that might just be an architecture thing
[04:49:54] <qrucial> the answer here is interesting https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12528049/if-a-dom-element-is-removed-are-its-listeners-also-removed-from-memory
[04:55:45] <al_nz1> hmm, I think I have approached this all wrong. I have a main window, with a button to lookup a person, clicking this button opens a modal where you enter the query data (like name or drivers license) - then click query, and another modal displays a table of returned people with a radio select next to each row of people. The idea is to select a person on this window, click the "ADD" button and
[04:55:45] <al_nz1> each field that persons data (surname, firstname, id, address, dob) are inserted into fields on the main window.
[04:56:21] <al_nz1> The issue is that i havent kept the persons fields seperate when returning them to the table
[04:56:49] <qrucial> thykka: pretty sure ill go with the rebinding method, just to keep it consistent with how im looking for this to work with the rest of the code!
[04:56:52] <al_nz1> the tablejust displays surname + firstname + middle <br/> dob </br> address
[06:19:18] <Rob_Jones> How would i use jquery to remove an attribute only if files have been uploaded to #file1 & #file2
[06:19:40] <Rob_Jones> the removing attribute is on #submit when attribute is disabled

[06:27:32] <Rob_Jones> ty
[07:02:30] <Rob_Jones> thykka: its not working for me, can i show you the full code over pm?
[07:05:05] <thykka> Rob_Jones, I'd rather you made a test case in jsfiddle/codepen/etc
[07:05:15] <Rob_Jones> thats where the codebase is
[07:05:19] <Rob_Jones> codepen
[07:05:27] <thykka> okay, a link'll do, then
[07:13:29] <Rob_Jones> sent :)
[08:10:44] <aias> I don't know much javascript but my site uses jquery. I copied it to another server and now the jquery elements don't work. Show, hide, etc. Any ideas why this may be?
[08:11:10] <aias> When viewing source and checking the links, they're all still there (to .js files, no broken links)
[08:11:22] <thykka> aias, jquery not included on other site? different version of jquery in use?
[08:11:29] <Cork> aias: and no errors in the browser console?
[08:12:06] <Cork> (check both the console and network tab)
[08:12:13] <aias> Thank you I'll check
[08:28:11] <aias> I replaced the jquery.min.js with a fresh version. Solved, thank you. Must have been an error when copying. "Unexpected ["
[09:08:18] <cek> hi. wtf is going on, my dynamically created form doesn't submit - no event is fired https://codepen.io/cek2/pen/xegxMX?editors=1111
[09:10:21] <cek> how could that be possible, there's a form, there's a submit, but submitting doesn't work!
[09:11:34] <cek> can it be because I preventDefault in click  handler of container element?
[09:12:11] <cek> fuck, indeed that's the case. who knew
[09:13:23] <cek> didn't know pressing enter inside focused input field inside a form inside a link is generating a click event on link first
[11:09:24] <Cork> cek: you should avoid to have forms inside a tags
[11:09:30] <Cork> that will make things break
[11:09:49] <Cork> (as a tags prevent clicks on child elements)

[11:51:17] <jak2000> hi all
[11:51:41] <robertmaxrees> good morning
[11:52:04] <jak2000> how to transform this JSON: https://jsfiddle.net/jamiguel77/ro3aw86x/1/   and add: the name property: sample: {name: "4.3 CALDERA", upload: "2.160"},   my JSON in the fidle was returned from server side...
[11:52:19] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 what have you tried?
[11:52:21] <robertmaxrees> did you search google?
[11:52:28] <robertmaxrees> is this actually jquery related? :)
[11:53:21] <jak2000> i think in server side can do the job o r transform it on jquery....
[11:53:30] <robertmaxrees> jquery doesn't handle transforming json.
[11:53:36] <jak2000> ok, thanks
[11:53:38] <robertmaxrees> what did you try searching google?
[11:54:11] <jak2000> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4071499/dynamically-add-variable-name-value-pairs-to-json-object
[11:54:28] <robertmaxrees> you need to parse the json first
[11:54:31] <robertmaxrees> then you can modify it.
[11:54:40] <jak2000> yes
[11:54:47] <jak2000> myData = JSON.parse(json.xGraficaGeneralPie);
[11:54:54] <jak2000> and the JSON is a valid JSON
[11:55:01] <robertmaxrees> so then show you trying that.
[11:55:03] <robertmaxrees> :)an
[11:55:09] <robertmaxrees> *and then we can help :)
[11:55:37] <jak2000> ok.
[11:58:14] <robertmaxrees> >.>
[11:58:16] <robertmaxrees> lol
[11:58:18] <robertmaxrees> sooo....
[12:00:10] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 are you going to update your fiddle?  super confused lol
[12:00:46] <discopatrick> I'm noticing that jquery/cheerio strips out td tags  if they are not inside the usual valid table > tr > td hierarchy. That's kind of useful, but I'm scraping invalid html and I'm wondering if there's a setting that will switch off this feature? I've tried xmlMode when loading the html, which keeps the td's, but then adds closing tags for all the unclosed br's! I might just have to accept that compromise, but I thought I
[12:00:46] <discopatrick> would ask here first.
[12:01:08] <robertmaxrees> discopatrick i'd have to see your code.
[12:05:28] <jak2000> yes, updating
[12:05:32] <jak2000> Reading and testing...
[12:07:35] <robertmaxrees> discopatrick fwiw, lots of browsers will also "fix" invalid markup for you.  depending on what you're doing, it might make more sense to use .map().get() instead and put your data in an array.
[12:16:41] <robertmaxrees> swear i'm gonna start kicking people that ask questions and then leave me hanging lol
[12:18:56] <discopatrick> robertmaxrees: thanks. The markup direct from the website is valid, but becomes invalid when I get the html of a particular tr, e.g. `$('tr').eq(0).html()` and then feed that into a new cheerio object. I might just be doing cheerio wrong though
[12:18:57] <jak2000> noooooo please not, we need a guide not the work.. only a guide for continue
[12:19:28] <robertmaxrees> discopatrick yeah, i would pull just the data out into an array and then render from there.
[12:19:44] <robertmaxrees> instead of what you're doing now.
[12:19:50] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 lol dude
[12:20:15] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/96gprvjo/
[12:20:24] <robertmaxrees> ^ that's how you parse it.
[12:20:31] <robertmaxrees> now your data is a normal array.  have at it.
[12:20:33] <robertmaxrees> ezpz.
[12:27:36] <jak2000> ok..
[12:27:39] <jak2000> start here
[12:28:21] <jak2000> thx
[12:56:15] <ASUchander> Where can I find the dates when versions of jQuery reached their end of supported maintenance?
[12:56:38] <ASUchander> I want to find out when 2.2 stopped getting things like security fixes, et.c
[12:56:40] <robertmaxrees> https://github.com/jquery/jquery.com/issues/162
[12:57:03] <robertmaxrees> basically, once a new version is out, the last is EOL except for super critical security issues.
[12:59:27] <ASUchander> So i guess I can just look at the last commt on the 2.2 branch I guess?
[13:00:56] <robertmaxrees> 2.x is no longer supported.
[13:01:08] <robertmaxrees> but sure?
[13:01:13] <robertmaxrees> or when the last 2.x release was done.
[13:04:19] <robertmaxrees> though i gotta ask - why do you need to know?
[13:15:01] <ASUchander> @robertmaxrees I'm just trying to build a business case for upgrading.
[13:15:11] <robertmaxrees> i have an easy one
[13:15:21] <robertmaxrees> old jquery doesn't support modern browsers
[13:15:52] <ASUchander> robertmaxrees: So I understand that, but the application in use still works with modern browsers so it's hard to justify it that way
[13:16:03] <robertmaxrees> new feature development.
[13:16:05] <ASUchander> is jquery UI no longer in active development?
[13:16:15] <robertmaxrees> the real cost is in the future.
[13:16:20] <ASUchander> I agree
[13:16:21] <robertmaxrees> and sorta?
[13:16:33] <robertmaxrees> there are plans.  not sure where that team is at these days.
[14:02:12] <robertparkerx> for some reason I get 400 bad request from this https://hastebin.com/enelitekur.php
[16:18:22] <khobo> https://jsfiddle.net/3npr6fbt/
[16:18:29] <khobo> i need help adding a window event into this
[16:18:31] <khobo> larger than 1050
[16:18:35] <khobo> it kills the process
[16:18:40] <khobo> could someone help me?
[16:18:43] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[16:18:51] <robertmaxrees> "a window event"?
[16:18:51] <khobo> uhhhohhh
[16:18:53] <khobo> don't yellow at me
[16:18:55] <khobo> window resize event*
[16:18:57] <khobo> yell*
[16:19:14] <robertmaxrees> so long as you throttle it, you should be fine.
[16:19:40] <khobo> mind if i PM you a link so you can see what's going on?
[16:19:44] <robertmaxrees> please don't :)
[16:19:58] <khobo> okay, well, if you fire the hamburger
[16:19:59] <robertmaxrees> what do you mean when you say "it kills the process"?
[16:20:09] <khobo> the hamburger kicks in at 1050px width
[16:20:10] <khobo> if you fire it
[16:20:17] <khobo> it overlays 100% 100%
[16:20:24] <khobo> if you drag it back past 1050 -> 1060
[16:20:26] <khobo> the overlay disappears
[16:20:31] <khobo> but the action hasn't completed
[16:20:35] <khobo> so you see hidden links and stuff
[16:20:43] <robertmaxrees> why can't this be done via css?
[16:21:07] <khobo> bc action is fired from JS
[16:21:12] <robertmaxrees> 'kay.
[16:21:17] <robertmaxrees> so what's the problem then?
[16:21:46] <khobo> https://bit.ly/2U75tVJ
[16:21:54] <khobo> try it you'll see exactly what i'm trying to say
[16:22:01] <khobo> go 1050 hit the hamburger
[16:22:05] <khobo> then drag larger than 1050
[16:22:14] <khobo> overlay disappears but the button hasn't completed it's action
[16:22:15] <robertmaxrees> 2 things.
[16:22:17] <khobo> so you're seeing the hidden links
[16:22:24] <robertmaxrees> dude, slow down
[16:22:41] <robertmaxrees> where's the code that handles the screen resize right now?
[16:23:07] <robertmaxrees> and also: i doubt most of your users will narrow the screen, fire the mobile menu, and then reexpand your site.
[16:23:16] <khobo> i know but it _really_ fucks it upo
[16:23:18] <khobo> when that happens
[16:23:21] <beshoo> i am injecting jQuery to the Instagram page to type comment and press the post button, well manage to type the comment but hell no way to click the POST button
[16:23:30] <khobo> https://bit.ly/2I8Sxx3
[16:23:33] <khobo> that's the JS file
[16:23:48] <robertmaxrees> khobo what's the specific code that's handling hiding/showing that overlay?
[16:23:54] <robertmaxrees> beshoo why are you doing that?
[16:24:08] <khobo> https://jsfiddle.net/3npr6fbt/1/
[16:24:18] <khobo> #nav_list
[16:24:20] <khobo> is the overlay
[16:24:26] <robertmaxrees> khobo the slideToggle?
[16:24:28] <khobo> it changes on media query @ 1050
[16:24:35] <beshoo> i want to post comment to my friends who send my likes to my photos
[16:24:39] <robertmaxrees> jfc khobo slow down
[16:25:00] <khobo> robertmaxrees: sorry man.. i'm just really frustrated right now -- this is literally the last issue
[16:25:02] <beshoo> so i am injecting jq to the Instagram
[16:25:05] <robertmaxrees> khobo where is the code that's hiding things at over 1050px?
[16:25:17] <khobo> do you want it in a fiddle? or the css file
[16:25:19] <beshoo> and type in the comment section
[16:25:30] <robertmaxrees> khobo in the fiddle.
[16:25:36] <beshoo> but it is almost impossible to click on the POST
[16:25:51] <robertmaxrees> beshoo would need to see your code, though that's getting into a grey area imo :)
[16:26:35] <khobo> https://jsfiddle.net/3npr6fbt/2/
[16:26:51] <beshoo> i will show you the LONG code :)
[16:26:59] <robertmaxrees> khobo let me rephrase this
[16:27:05] <robertmaxrees> you're already controlling this via css.
[16:27:10] <robertmaxrees> you need to fix it via css
[16:27:16] <robertmaxrees> beshoo i just want the specific, relevant bits.
[16:27:39] <khobo> *squints
[16:27:44] <robertmaxrees> @media screen and (max-width: 1050px) {
[16:27:48] <khobo> all the css is determining
[16:27:51] <khobo> is the overlay
[16:27:56] <khobo> the action is happening JS side
[16:28:01] <robertmaxrees> i give up.
[16:28:03] <robertmaxrees> good luck :)
[16:28:08] <khobo> cool you were lots of help
[16:28:11] <khobo> thx
[16:29:30] <beshoo> robertmaxrees : https://pastebin.com/B9s1TGT2
[16:29:31] <robertmaxrees> beshoo fwiw you could always just try submitting the form.
[16:29:42] <beshoo> this code include jq and key type lib
[16:29:44] <robertmaxrees> :sigh:
[16:29:45] <beshoo> scrall down
[16:29:48] <robertmaxrees> ik don't need all of that.
[16:29:57] <robertmaxrees> just your code.
[16:30:11] <beshoo> No Way i tried that
[16:30:13] <robertmaxrees> remove everything but your code.
[16:30:31] <robertmaxrees> and use jsfiddle
[16:30:53] <beshoo> jsfiddle will not help here
[16:30:59] <robertmaxrees> lol
[16:31:02] <robertmaxrees> good luck duder :)
[16:31:34] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/o570xq4L/
[16:31:40] <robertmaxrees> literally all i needed you to do.
[16:31:41] <robertmaxrees> :shrug:
[16:32:16] <robertmaxrees> what's up with this events lib?  why not just set the input value?
[16:33:26] <beshoo> i am testing
[16:34:19] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[16:35:05] <beshoo> will it type but not POST
[16:35:17] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[16:35:44] <beshoo> it type in the comment section I love It
[16:35:46] <beshoo> but
[16:35:52] <beshoo> not post it
[16:36:02] <robertmaxrees> okay.  so what have you tried to post?
[16:37:06] <beshoo> i want to click on the POST button
[16:37:14] <beshoo> https://i.vgy.me/FYz8AI.png
[16:37:18] <robertmaxrees> so where's the code for that?
[16:38:31] <robertmaxrees> none of the code you've shared shows you trying to submit the form.
[16:38:34] <beshoo> the selector is form>button._0mzm-.sqdOP.yWX7d
[16:39:00] <robertmaxrees> it looks like you're doing a .trigger and then typing "i love it" into there?
[16:39:11] <beshoo> $('form>button._0mzm-.sqdOP.yWX7d').trigger( "click" );
[16:39:21] <beshoo> no
[16:39:27] <beshoo> i type then click
[16:40:00] <robertmaxrees> https://i.imgur.com/4IlcHJd.png
[16:40:10] <robertmaxrees> then share your real code.
[16:40:39] <robertmaxrees> also: you could try to trigger the form submit instead.
[16:41:40] <beshoo> i did that not help
[16:41:44] <robertmaxrees> show me
[16:41:46] <beshoo> let me clean my code hold on
[16:42:13] <robertmaxrees> also: is the idea to have this automatically comment on instagram posts?
[16:43:36] <robertmaxrees> because if that's the case, you should really review their TOS and consider using their API: https://developers.facebook.com/docs/instagram-api/reference/media/comments#create
[16:47:16] <beshoo> Oh yes , the SDK need approval if you want other to use the app
[16:47:24] <beshoo> but it is only me with my account
[16:47:31] <robertmaxrees> lol
[16:47:36] <robertmaxrees> that's fine?
[16:48:24] <beshoo> well , i am learning
[16:48:44] <beshoo> any way
[16:48:44] <beshoo>  $('.Ypffh').trigger({type: 'keydown', key: 'I Love It'});
[16:48:54] <robertmaxrees> ?
[16:48:54] <beshoo> it works to type cos of the lib i am using
[16:49:00] <robertmaxrees> ok?
[16:49:07] <robertmaxrees> you said you could type into the form fine.
[16:49:10] <beshoo> but i never abaile to click POST
[16:49:19] <robertmaxrees> so how are you trying to click post?
[16:49:26] <beshoo> YES
[16:49:26] <robertmaxrees> have you tried directly submitting the form insteaD?
[16:49:38] <beshoo> YES and it not work
[16:49:39] <robertmaxrees> i haven't seen any code of you trying ti click the post button.
[16:49:42] <beshoo> i am not sure why
[16:49:44] <robertmaxrees> so show me?
[16:50:22] <beshoo> and i set on submit return false, cos if you submit the form , it will post to the page it slef and it will pass the ajax
[16:50:45] <beshoo> hmmm , O.K. hold
[16:50:46] <robertmaxrees> i can't help if you don't actually show me the code.
[16:51:02] <beshoo> :) hold let me test again
[16:53:55] <beshoo> $('form.X7cDz').submit(function(){ return false; });
[16:54:04] <robertmaxrees> that'
[16:54:09] <robertmaxrees> *that's not submitting anything.
[16:54:18] <robertmaxrees> that's a submit handler.  and will prevent the form from submitting.
[16:54:22] <robertmaxrees> which isn't what you want.
[16:54:30] <beshoo> Please advice then
[16:54:31] <robertmaxrees> .submit() is all you need
[16:54:39] <beshoo> i test it
[16:54:43] <beshoo> it reload the page
[16:54:51] <beshoo> and pass the ajax
[16:54:54] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[16:54:57] <robertmaxrees> "and pass the ajax"??
[16:55:06] <beshoo> i mean the form using ajax
[16:55:08] <robertmaxrees> it either does it via ajax or it doesnt :)
[16:55:28] <beshoo> Instagram use ajax to send the from
[16:55:47] <beshoo> .submit() will reload the page
[16:55:55] <beshoo> let me show you what the message i got
[16:56:54] <beshoo> https://i.vgy.me/4Rs7AK.png
[16:57:11] <beshoo> this when i use $('form.X7cDz').submit();
[16:57:19] <robertmaxrees> also: keep in mind that instagram is probably trying to prevent you from doing what you're doing.
[16:58:06] <beshoo> well i am trying to find a workarround since i can inject javascript in my chrome
[16:58:22] <robertmaxrees> the "workaround" is that you use the API like you're supposed to :)
[16:58:28] <robertmaxrees> there's a good reason they make you do that.
[16:58:38] <robertmaxrees> they don't want people spamming the service.
[16:58:50] <beshoo> it is only me with my own account
[16:58:57] <robertmaxrees> and again
[16:58:57] <beshoo> i will never spam my account !
[16:59:02] <robertmaxrees> they're trying to prevent spam.
[16:59:11] <robertmaxrees> you're trying to automatically comment on things :)
[16:59:22] <beshoo> yes to my account to my friends !
[16:59:31] <robertmaxrees> lol

[17:02:58] <beshoo> https://pastebin.com/323UJ9p7
[17:03:12] <robertmaxrees> aaaand again
[17:03:18] <robertmaxrees> please just share the relevant bits.
[17:03:26] <robertmaxrees> i don't need the contents of the libraries.
[17:03:40] <beshoo> O.K. sorry
[17:03:50] <beshoo> i told me self you may want to test
[17:03:59] <robertmaxrees> then you want to make a fiddle.
[17:04:25] <robertmaxrees> https://irc.jquery.org/irc-help/#asking-good-questions
[17:04:32] <robertmaxrees> "The best way to get your issue resolved quickly is to get straight to the point and explain the problem clearly with a reduced test case."
[17:04:36] <robertmaxrees> you haven't done that part :)
[17:05:22] <beshoo> https://jsfiddle.net/3a752rmb/
[17:05:43] <robertmaxrees> lmfao
[17:05:44] <robertmaxrees> dude
[17:05:52] <robertmaxrees> where's this mysterious click trigger??
[17:06:42] <beshoo> O.K. i add it
[17:06:55] <beshoo> hold
[17:06:58] <beshoo> i will?*
[17:08:09] <beshoo> https://jsfiddle.net/3a752rmb/2/
[17:08:23] <robertmaxrees> okay.
[17:08:35] <robertmaxrees> try this: what happens if you do console.log($('.X7cDz > button._0mzm-.sqdOP.yWX7d').length);?
[17:08:40] <robertmaxrees> what do you get?>
[17:08:46] <beshoo> hold
[17:10:09] <beshoo> 1
[17:10:16] <robertmaxrees> okay.
[17:10:26] <robertmaxrees> dunno then.  without an actual test case it's real hard to help.
[17:10:43] <robertmaxrees> my guess is that they're explicitly trying to prevent exactly this kind of behavior.
[17:11:17] <beshoo> actual test case , how can i provide this
[17:11:22] <robertmaxrees> :shrug: :)
[17:11:30] <beshoo> you need to test on your chrome
[17:11:32] <beshoo> correct ?
[17:11:52] <robertmaxrees> since they're likely actively trying to prevent this kind of stuff i'd look for another way to do this.
[17:12:51] <beshoo> can you inject code in your chrome ?
[17:13:12] <robertmaxrees> i could, but i'm not comfortable helping you violate a TOS.
[17:14:09] <beshoo> hmmm will i understand but it is not a big deal while i am doing this in my account to show up to my gf ... and i am learning
[17:14:36] <beshoo> no one like to spam his account
[17:14:46] <beshoo> i can not use this in any other accounts
[17:15:09] <beshoo> SDK if you want to autmate others account in your server
[17:15:21] <beshoo> but here i am using my account ! in my chrome
[17:17:09] <robertmaxrees> :shrug: dunno what to tell you.
[17:17:35] <prohobo> robertparkerx: why did u kick my fren
[17:17:52] <robertmaxrees> huh?

[17:22:21] <robertmaxrees> sorry.
[17:22:44] <beshoo> it is a jq question
[17:22:56] <robertmaxrees> :shrug: you're trying to violate a site's terms of use.
[17:23:09] <beshoo> so Instagram will ban my account
[17:23:20] <robertmaxrees> i have no idea what you're actually going to use this for.
[17:23:22] <beshoo> are you Instagram owner
[17:23:38] <robertmaxrees> drop the subject and move on kthx :)
[17:23:49] <beshoo> i swore to god i am not spaming !
[17:23:57] <robertmaxrees> :shrug: bummer.
[17:24:15] <beshoo> any way i am asking normal jq question
[17:29:38] <robertmaxrees> this freaking day
[19:24:19] <znf> Is there any known issue with jQuery being pushed via http2 and not being ready?
[21:29:56] <Woet> znf: nope
[21:30:33] <znf> yeah, figured, just a silly wordpress plugin forgetting to require jquery as a dep
[21:30:46] <znf> and the issue wasn't manifesting itself until I started pushing it
[21:47:41] <Jasein> can I use jquery to read css media query breakpoints?
[23:48:20] <alturic> Hello, fairly fresh to jQuery ($.each) but I have what I believe is an array of objects(?), and I'm looking to rearrange the output based on column names, but I can't seem to figure out the proper way to iterate over the array while pushing the 2 state's as keys, counties as keys, etc. https://jsfiddle.net/q0v4fce7/
