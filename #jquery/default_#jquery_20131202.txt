[00:02:17] <xqo> what do you find is usually the culprit when you bind click something, but nothing happens when you click?
[00:02:41] <Cork> xqo: normally it is 1. the element doesn't exist when the selector runs
[00:02:54] <Cork> 2. you use id and the id exists more then once
[00:03:06] <Cork> 3. something is covering the element so click doesn't get to it
[00:03:23] <Cork> 4. js error
[00:03:39] <xqo> i added 	alert($(".tab").length); in front of my .click() and got 0
[00:03:47] <xqo> so its number 1. i guess
[00:03:54] <Cork> ya
[00:03:56] <xqo> its a dynamically added element
[00:04:04] <Cork> so you need event delegation
[00:04:11] <xqo> ?
[00:04:21] <Cork> http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[00:04:56] <xqo> ok thanks!
[00:09:01] <xqo> Cork #web is telling me to use on instead of delegate
[00:09:16] <Cork> xqo: yes, but be sure to read delegate
[00:09:31] <Cork> cause 99%+ of the ones using on just goes at it and does it wrong
[00:09:51] <Cork> xqo: if you read delegate it will explain how it works
[00:10:08] <Cork> (uses on for the first time)
[00:10:35] <xqo> $("body").on("click", ".tab", function() {
[00:10:36] <xqo> ?
[00:10:49] <Cork> possible solution yes
[00:10:59] <Cork> not guaranteed to be the correct
[00:11:15] <xqo> seems to work fine
[00:11:16] <xqo> thx
[00:11:26] <Cork> xqo: just read delegate it will explain it (you would have known all of this if you bothered to look at the link i gave you...)
[00:11:41] <xqo> i looked at the link to find the syntax for the function... :p
[00:11:59] <Cork> beyond the first 5 lines of syntax
[00:15:17] <k0bi> $.ajax({ post on ie9 with cross domain doset work is some one had trid this
[00:18:36] <Cork> k0bi: ie doesn't support cors
[00:18:45] <Cork> k0bi: you need to use XDomain there
[00:19:00] <Cork> https://gist.github.com/mathieucarbou/1114981
[00:19:30] <Cork> (one example of a plugin that does that)
[00:19:33] <Cork> there are more
[00:20:33] <Cork> k0bi: also warning, ie doesn't support www-form-encoded headers for cors domain posts
[00:20:54] <Cork> k0bi: it will come into the server as text/plain and you will have to run your own code to parse the data
[00:21:15] <Cork> *for cross domain
[00:21:36] <Cork> k0bi: so basically; don't do cross domain posts if you need ie support
[00:26:06] <joroci> Cork
[00:26:27] <joroci> every loop iteration i just append a new image element
[00:26:43] <k0bi> <Cork> sorry been in javascript room
[00:27:01] <k0bi> for XDomainRequest
[00:27:03] <k0bi> hamm
[00:27:07] <Cork> k0bi: don't double post
[00:27:19] <Cork> it waists ppl time
[00:27:32] <k0bi> i know
[00:27:36] <k0bi> sorry
[00:27:45] <k0bi> but there i ask for XDomainRequest
[00:27:46] <Cork> joroci: then it should load just fine
[00:27:54] <k0bi> and here for the $.post
[00:28:26] <Cork> joroci: you would have to wait for the load event on the img tag if you need to do something after the image has been loaded
[00:31:02] <joroci> Cork the problem is after a few images i get 404 and 503 responses
[00:31:40] <Cork> joroci: that sound like a dos check or something like that
[00:31:40] <joroci> if i use timeout it's ok
[00:32:11] <Cork> joroci: you could set a load event on the image tag so you only request a new image when the old one is done
[00:32:15] <Cork> and see if that helps
[00:32:46] <joroci> guess it is if using timeout helps
[00:33:31] <joroci> but anyway i'll just keep the results in array and load the right images based on user input
[00:46:29] <SillyTalker> is there a specific channel for jquery mobile?
[00:47:21] <SillyTalker> i have a list with autodividers and a filter, but the dividers that do not have items under them after filtering to not disappear
[00:54:05] <tm89> how can i select all text-tags that doesn't have class="legend"?
[00:55:57] <tm89> i tried $("text [class!='legend']"), but it didnt work..
[00:57:13] <Cork> text tags?
[00:57:15] <Cork> xml?
[00:57:39] <Cork> $("text").not('.legend')
[00:58:19] <tm89> its from svg
[00:58:24] <Cork> ah
[01:07:39] <SillyTalker> anyone?
[01:07:43] <tm89> it removed both text with legend-class and text without
[01:08:28] <Cork> tm89: $("text").not('.legend').remove() should just remove the text elements with the class legend
[01:08:43] <Cork> if you get more please show an example
[01:09:12] <Cork> SillyTalker: you are in the correct channel, but the number of users helping with mobile questions is quite low
[01:09:26] <tm89> $("text").not('.legend').remove() should just remove the text elements WITH the class legend?
[01:09:34] <Cork> no
[01:09:36] <Cork> without
[01:09:47] <Cork> notice the not part
[01:09:48] <tm89> ok, just checking:) thank you:)
[01:13:44] <SillyTalker> Cork: damn
[01:14:09] <SillyTalker> google is not much help either for this
[01:18:42] <SillyTalker> hm i see in a demo this works :s
[01:19:57] <SillyTalker> aaah its broken with-1.4.0-rc.1
[01:20:03] <SillyTalker> where do i report this?
[01:22:16] <Cork> SillyTalker: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#issues
[01:22:30] <Cork> (ugg they are hiding that quite well...)
[01:23:01] <SillyTalker> Cork: ty
[01:23:27] <Cork> np
[01:29:32] <ServerSage> So I think my google skills are failing me.  Should $('select').click() cause the select options to drop down/display?
[01:29:49] <Cork> ServerSage: depends on the browser
[01:29:58] <Cork> but i don't think you can count on it
[01:30:16] <ServerSage> Cork: Is there a reliable cross browser way to drop down a select?
[01:31:04] <Cork> ServerSage: not as far as i know
[01:31:18] <ServerSage> Cork: K, thanks.
[01:31:41] <Cork> ServerSage: browsers consider the form elements to be the users
[01:31:55] <Cork> so interaction with them is often limited from code
[01:32:18] <ServerSage> Cork: Makes sense I suppose.
[01:32:51] <Cork> well it causes a lot of web developers to generate crazy hacks
[01:33:03] <Cork> like reimplementing the element with divs and so on
[01:33:37] <ServerSage> Cork: Yeah, I see there are many plugins out there that get around this now that I'm digging into alternatives.
[01:33:52] <Cork> ServerSage: be careful with those though
[01:34:23] <Cork> the over whelming majority of them generate broken forms
[01:34:34] <Cork> where either keyboard inputs doens't work
[01:34:39] <Cork> or accessibility doesn't work
[01:34:41] <Cork> or...
[01:34:45] <ServerSage> Lovely.
[01:34:46] <ServerSage> lol
[01:38:23] <SillyTalker> how can i see what has been changed betzeen the last stable version of jquery mobile and 1.4.0-rc.1
[01:38:26] <SillyTalker> ?
[01:38:32] <SillyTalker> *between
[01:39:11] <Cork> SillyTalker: if you want the code
[01:39:12] <Cork> clone the git tree and diff it
[01:39:24] <Cork> SillyTalker: if you just want a list of features check the blog
[01:40:26] <SillyTalker> Cork: teh code; but any way to do it webbased, and i cannot find the 1.4.0rc1 on git
[01:40:40] <Cork> don't think so
[01:41:18] <Cork> SillyTalker: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/tree/1.4.0-rc.1
[01:41:55] <SillyTalker> Cork: ty
[01:43:44] <Cork> SillyTalker: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/compare/1.3-stable...1.4.0-rc.1
[01:46:32] <SillyTalker> ok i got completely different files
[01:46:48] <SillyTalker> i give up this makes no sense
[01:46:56] <SillyTalker> i would try to fix the problem if it made sense
[01:47:02] <SillyTalker> their loss
[02:00:14] <msafi> Is it me or is the demo on this page broken? http://jqueryui.com/sortable/
[02:00:41] <Cork> msafi: what part?
[02:01:20] <msafi> Cork, the elements aren't interactiing with the mouse at all, except for being highlighted when I try to drag or sort them
[02:01:35] <msafi> Cork, I see this error message in the console: Uncaught TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'selectable'
[02:01:40] <Cork> are you talking about the default functionality view?
[02:02:05] <Cork> msafi: make sure you arn't blocking jquery from loading
[02:02:19] <Cork> anyway no the demos works fine here
[02:02:23] <msafi> Cork, how would I be blocking jQuery?
[02:02:29] <Cork> at least the ones i've tested
[02:02:36] <Cork> msafi: depends on the browser
[02:02:38] <msafi> Cork, I tried it in Chrome and IE11
[02:03:51] <msafi> Cork, do you see such error in your console?
[02:04:35] <Cork> only the depricateion warnings from the source map links
[02:04:52] <Cork> "SyntaxError: Using //@ to indicate sourceMappingURL pragmas is deprecated. Use //# instead"
[02:04:55] <Cork> but it is expected
[02:05:43] <MCBL> It seems to work as expected. But the console state:
[02:05:43] <MCBL>   Uncaught ReferenceError: $ is not defined default.html:16
[02:05:43] <MCBL>   (anonymous function)
[02:05:58] <Cork> ya, cause something is blocking jquery from loading for you
[02:06:17] <Cork> might be a bad cdn or something
[02:06:20] <Cork> check the network tab
[02:07:13] <msafi> Cork, I went to the source and tried loading all JS files individually. Everything seems to be working. Will check in network tab now.
[02:07:25] <Cork> check the network tab <--
[02:07:35] <Cork> hit ctrl + f5 on the page
[02:07:39] <Cork> and check the network tab
[02:08:23] <msafi> Hmm, actually, won't network errors also show in console?
[02:08:40] <Cork> depends on your settings
[02:08:43] <Cork> and browser
[02:10:20] <Cork> the only error i have is that http://jqueryui.com/jquery-wp-content/themes/jquery/js/dist/jquery-migrate.min.map is 404
[02:11:28] <SillyTalker> i made a bug report for it here my problem here: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6783
[02:11:56] <msafi> Cork, in the network tab, that's the only error I have to.
[02:12:14] <Cork> msafi: try clearing your cache then i guess
[02:12:42] <msafi> Cork, it seems that the file responsible for loading jquery-ui is not loading for me. Do you know which file is responsible for loading jquery-ui so that I can do a "find" on it?
[02:13:29] <SillyTalker> *for my problem
[02:13:56] <Cork> http://code.jquery.com/ui/1.10.3/jquery-ui.js
[02:14:37] <Ububegin> On this page, I was trying this snippet var data = jQuery.map(json.BrowserStats, function(el, i) {  return new [el.engine, el.browser, el.platform, el.version];}); Inside another method, but my browser threw the Object is not a function error.. Any one can shed a light on this..
[02:14:39] <Ububegin> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7640204/how-to-load-the-local-json-variable-using-jquery-datatable
[02:16:39] <Cork> msafi: http://jqueryui.com/resources/demos/sortable/default.html
[02:17:21] <Bauer> Cork: Can you look please: on IE 9, clicking on the vCloud flash banner here is not working: https://cloud.ccccloud.com/index.php?service=vm  the event is not firing
[02:17:45] <Bauer> I know it works on IE 11, havent had 10 to test yet
[02:17:55] <Cork> Bauer: what element is that
[02:18:02] <Cork> i don't feel like loading a ton of flash plugins
[02:18:12] <msafi> Cork, something very strange going on. http://code.jquery.com/ui/1.10.3/jquery-ui.js <-- if I go to this file and keep pressing ctrl+F5 sometimes it loads content, sometimes it comes back blank!
[02:18:26] <Cork> msafi: so you have a bad cdn node
[02:18:30] <Cork> like i said
[02:19:20] <Bauer> Cork: it is inside $('#vCloud-Wrapper-Div')
[02:21:33] <Cork> Bauer: ugg the code is scattered all over the place...
[02:21:40] <Cork> no i don't know what is going on
[02:21:55] <Cork> Bauer: make sure the cover screen is positioned over the element
[02:22:26] <Bauer> Cork: you helped come up with the cover screen last week :) and it works in every other browser except IE 9..
[02:22:48] <Cork> Bauer: might be ie doesn't support putting elements ontop of plugins
[02:22:59] <Cork> older firefox couldn't do it either
[02:23:13] <Ububegin> Cork :On this page, I was trying this snippet var data = jQuery.map(json.BrowserStats, function(el, i) {  return new [el.engine, el.browser, el.platform, el.version];}); Inside another method, but my browser threw the Object is not a function error.. Any one can shed a light on this..
[02:23:14] <Cork> as plugins was actual windows, and was put ontop of the page
[02:23:50] <Cork> uh...
[02:23:52] <Cork> what ?
[02:23:55] <Cork> return new [el.engine, el.browser, el.platform, el.version] ?!?
[02:24:07] <Cork> not even sure what you are trying to do there
[02:24:16] <Ububegin> Cork: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7640204/how-to-load-the-local-json-variable-using-jquery-datatable
[02:24:19] <Cork> or was the new left by mistake?
[02:24:32] <Cork> Ububegin: if you ask on stackoverflow wait for an answer there
[02:24:33] <Ububegin> Cork: It is the 2nd solution there.
[02:24:55] <Cork> ...
[02:25:09] <Cork> well that code doesn't make sense
[02:26:45] <sacho> Ububegin, just remove the new.
[02:29:05] <Bauer> Cork: well, any ideas how to bypass this problem? and how to confirm that indeed IE9 does not support putting elements above the plugin, like you've said?
[02:29:34] <Cork> Bauer: try setting a higher z-index on the cover screen
[02:29:35] <Bauer> if its impossible technically to do it, I would be happy with this answer if I can mail a link to it, with a nice reminder that I told them not to use flash :P
[02:29:44] <Cork> if that doesn't help... well your out of luck
[02:30:42] <Cork> best option is prob to do what i gave you as an option
[02:30:52] <Cork> have flash trigger events for things in flash
[02:30:57] <Cork> and have js catch that
[02:31:09] <Cork> hacks is hacks...
[02:31:41] <spexi> Hi! I have function, what is triggered with onclick. It's on a link, and it shows a hidden div, and the hidden div is given position based on onclick cursor position. If I'm browsing the top of the page, everything is fine, it shows the div next to link. If I'm browsing on the bottom of the page, after clicking the link the page scrolls up automatically. Why is that?
[02:32:05] <spexi> (And the div isn't anymore visible, because onmouseout hides the div.. so that's problem)
[02:32:24] <Cork> spexi: you would have to provide an example
[02:32:31] <Cork> jsfiddle.net
[02:32:47] <ghostlines> hi, I want to link to a loading page then when it's finished continue right where the code left off that sent me to the loading page. How can I best approach this?
[02:34:15] <Bauer> Cork: that would require tools to open and modify the Flash (adobe?) and expertise.. which I dont have (I am not Flash designer, thanks god)
[02:34:44] <Cork> Bauer: no it would require the original uncompiled project and adobe flashworks
[02:34:51] <Cork> you can't really modify a flash file
[02:35:57] <Cork> ghostlines: what constitutes "finished"?
[02:36:38] <ghostlines> after my app cache is fully updated
[02:36:58] <Cork> and how would the page know that?
[02:37:37] <Ububegin> Cork: I have an array of objects where object is of this form {"a":"apple","b","banana"} , i want to change it to ["apple","banana"]
[02:37:37] <ghostlines> an app cache loaded event
[02:37:38] <spexi> Cork: I solved it on my own. I had to do event.preventDefault(); on my script
[02:37:44] <spexi> so the page doesn't scroll up automatically
[02:37:57] <Cork> ghostlines: so do window.location = original_url;
[02:38:00] <Cork> in the event
[02:38:31] <Cork> Ububegin: Object.values(obj)
[02:38:37] <Cork> ?mdn Object.values
[02:38:38] <b-ot> Cork: Object - JavaScript | MDN - Mozilla Developer Network → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object
[02:38:45] <Cork> uh...
[02:38:56] <ghostlines> Cork: but then it would go into a loop every time I click the link, I want to know if it can continue right where the code left off that called it
[02:39:16] <Cork> ugg
[02:39:22] <Cork> values is in harmony...
[02:41:00] <Ububegin> Cork: Object function Object() has no method 'values'
[02:41:15] <Cork> ya
[02:41:19] <Cork> see above :)
[02:41:27] <ghostlines> the 'link' is actually a touch start event that suppose to load a game, but I want to put a loading screen in-between when the games launch
[02:41:33] <Cork> Ububegin: you would have to loop the object
[02:42:03] <Cork> Ububegin: i think $.map(obj, function() { return this; }) should work
[02:48:40] <bigbugjava> Hi, I want to get this Array : http://jsfiddle.net/BtNyb/ , into a datatable with an colum named "Facebook Names", cant get it to work.
[02:50:32] <bigbugjava> updated with datatable : http://jsfiddle.net/BtNyb/1/
[02:51:50] <Ububegin> Cork: When I printed console.log(data[0]); After doing this  dataNew = $.map(data, function() { return this; }).. when I try console.log(dataNew[0]); .. I see some Window {top etc.... stuffs}
[02:54:30] <Cork> Ububegin:
[02:54:33] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/h4k9a/
[02:58:30] <bigbugjava> lets say I have this array: ["Meni Lev Ari", "Eli Shlymovich", "Lilach Chen"] and I want it to be: [{"FB":"Meni Lev Ari"}, {"FB":"Meni Lev23 Ari"}, {"FB":"Meni 123Lev Ari"}] how I can I get there?
[02:58:46] <bigbugjava> it's for the datatable ofcouse, only way I get him to reconize it
[02:59:09] <Cork> bigbugjava: so you just want to set a static key for the value?
[02:59:35] <Cork> $.map(["Meni Lev Ari", "Eli Shlymovich", "Lilach Chen"], function(v) { return { "FB": v}; } })
[03:00:24] <bigbugjava> "Meni Lev Ari", "Eli Shlymovich", "Lilach Chen" if it's called FbNames, just put FbNames there?
[03:00:27] <bigbugjava> will try sec
[03:03:57] <bigbugjava> Cork it gives me the same output
[03:04:21] <bigbugjava> http://jsfiddle.net/BtNyb/2/
[03:05:43] <Cork> uh
[03:05:50] <Cork> your returning an array of one value
[03:05:53] <Cork> not an object
[03:05:59] <Cork> and yes that won't change anything
[03:06:04] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/KnEcV/
[03:08:15] <bigbugjava> Cork, sry for looking silly, but still cant figure how to get pass it
[03:08:45] <Cork> bigbugjava: the example i gave you gives you an array of objects
[03:08:49] <bigbugjava> cant see the differnce between FbName and ["Meni Lev Ari", "Eli Shlymovich", "Lilach Chen"]
[03:08:50] <Cork> exactly like you asked for
[03:09:11] <Cork> the difference is in what the map function does
[03:10:20] <bigbugjava> I get it in console.log to work, not in script it self
[03:10:54] <Cork> bigbugjava: make sure your script does the same thing
[03:12:42] <bigbugjava> to get it to work with Datatable, I need it to be an array
[03:12:47] <bigbugjava> may be I mislead you
[03:13:03] <Cork> so you need an array of arrays not objects?
[03:15:18] <bigbugjava> In datatable, I was able to get this string to work : /*  var  testdata = [{"id":"58","country_code":"UK","title":"Legal Director","pubdate":"2012-03-08 00:00:00","url":"http://..."},{"id":"59","country_code":"UK","title":"Solutions Architect,".... ETC, nothing eles worked
[03:15:30] <bigbugjava> the MasterObject I got look like this : 1 sec
[03:15:44] <Cork> so...
[03:15:50] <Cork> what input needs to be what output
[03:16:14] <bigbugjava> http://jsfiddle.net/BtNyb/3/
[03:16:40] <Cork> what input needs to be what output?
[03:16:50] <Cork> please answer the questions >_<
[03:16:50] <bigbugjava> so it's a big object, that need to be converted to what I just got you there
[03:16:53] <bigbugjava> sry
[03:17:28] <bigbugjava> {"FBName":"MasterObject.FacebookName[key]"},{"FBName":"MasterObject.FacebookName[key]"},{"FBName":"MasterObject.FacebookName[key]"}.. and so on
[03:18:38] <bigbugjava> I use Key because it's not 0-to a number, becuase it changes when I get get values from FB.API I get it by index.. a bit complex.. ;)
[03:19:55] <bigbugjava> I answered?
[03:20:09] <Cork> not really...
[03:20:24] <bigbugjava> ohhh dear me, need to improve my english
[03:20:41] <Cork> doesn't really have to do with english
[03:20:50] <bigbugjava> lol
[03:21:09] <Cork> you get [something,something,something] in and you want [something-else, something-else, something-else] out
[03:21:16] <Cork> you haven't explained the structure
[03:21:21] <bigbugjava> yeah
[03:21:58] <Cork> well you did, but apparently that was wrong
[03:22:14] <bigbugjava> I just changed an object strcture to ["Meni Lev Ari", "Eli Shlymovich", "Lilach Chen"], so lets stick to that
[03:22:31] <Cork> something like this is what i'm looking for: [["Meni Lev Ari", "Eli Shlymovich", "Lilach Chen"] => [{"FB":"Meni Lev Ari"}, {"FB":"Meni Lev23 Ari"}, {"FB":"Meni 123Lev Ari"}]]
[03:22:37] <Cork> but with what you really need
[03:23:31] <Cork> * ["Meni Lev Ari", "Eli Shlymovich", "Lilach Chen"] => [{"FB":"Meni Lev Ari"}, {"FB":"Meni Lev23 Ari"}, {"FB":"Meni 123Lev Ari"}]
[03:23:34] <doev> can someone look to this code please? http://pastebin.com/HyT6yvt9   .... I try to change the ajax-request from an inline function to an external on, but get the error "result" not defined.
[03:23:38] <bigbugjava> Yeah, thats what I need, not Object->Object.. like before, it's the only thing I can get Datatable to work with
[03:23:59] <Cork> bigbugjava: the fiddle i gave you does that exact convertion
[03:24:54] <Cork> doev: success: success(result) => success: success,
[03:25:02] <bigbugjava> I get it an object on console.log
[03:25:03] <Cork> doev:*  success: success(result) => success: success
[03:25:18] <Cork> you said you wanted an array of objects...
[03:25:21] <Cork> >_<
[03:25:30] <bigbugjava> lol
[03:25:42] <Cork> so again, show what you get in and what you want out
[03:26:05] <bigbugjava> sec, let me try to ship it to DT, lets see, Big BIGG  thanks!
[03:26:33] <Cork> sigh
[03:29:26] <SprkDev> I am trying to find a jquery plugin which will allow me to do this. Anyone know where I can find one? http://instagram.com/p/hArLj_hM8R/
[03:29:43] <SprkDev> the popup that scrolls to the next item inside the modal window
[03:29:48] <SprkDev> but I can't find any.
[03:30:14] <slax0r> I see no popup
[03:30:24] <doev> Cork, expected comma but found ....
[03:31:10] <doev> lets give the function success another name suc() .... success: suc(result) => success: success   ?
[03:31:18] <Cork> ugg
[03:31:35] <Cork> doev: no i meant replace success:success(result) with success: success
[03:31:52] <slax0r> *with success: suc()
[03:31:53] <Cork> you can't include arguments when you pass a function reference
[03:31:53] <slax0r> :P
[03:31:59] <bigbugjava> Cork, Kinda working, it gets to the table and gives the names there, it doesn't to do that correctly, If I state it's on Object with aaData:[FbName], it dones't find an FB for each one, because it's FB-> 0-whatever , if I state aaData:FbNames , it skips on colums and just send name,name,name on same td.
[03:31:59] <Cork> slacko_: no
[03:32:06] <Cork> *slax0r:
[03:32:35] <slax0r> oh, he's passing args, I thought you wanted him to rename the function as well :)
[03:34:05] <Cork> bigbugjava: sorry i give up, i have no clue what you want to do
[03:35:14] <bigbugjava> Cork: alright, thanks for help man! appricated!
[03:41:18] <doev> Cork, slax0r when I do a alert(result) in suc() I get 'undefined' ... where does result came from? jquery?
[03:41:37] <Cork> doev: please pb the updated code
[03:45:05] <SprkDev> anyone?
[03:48:49] <doev> Cork, there was a php-script error, everything works now, thx
[03:49:27] <doev> slax0r, thx too
[04:16:44] <xqo> ihow do you check if a string is not none or whatever?
[04:22:30] <Cork> xqo: if(s) ?
[04:23:26] <xqo> you dont have to check against values, you can do if ("this is not an empty string so it evaluates to true and therefore i can proceed") {proceed();} ?
[04:23:42] <Cork> yes
[04:23:47] <xqo> ok thank you
[04:23:55] <Cork> js> print(!!"")
[04:24:01] <b-ot> Cork: false
[04:24:03] <Cork> js> print(!!"something")
[04:24:08] <b-ot> Cork: true
[04:24:30] <Cork> js> print(!!"0")
[04:24:36] <b-ot> Cork: true
[04:24:41] <xqo> what are the !! ?
[04:25:03] <Cork> double inversion
[04:25:13] <Cork> converts a truthy value to a bool
[04:25:29] <Cork> (not not "")
[04:25:45] <Cork> you normally don't need to do this
[04:25:46] <xqo> js> print(!"single");
[04:25:51] <b-ot> xqo: false
[04:25:59] <xqo> js> print("noneatall");
[04:26:05] <b-ot> xqo: noneatall
[04:26:05] <Cork> js> print(!true)
[04:26:07] <Cork> js> print(!false)
[04:26:10] <b-ot> Cork: false
[04:26:12] <Cork> js> print(!!true)
[04:26:15] <b-ot> Cork: true
[04:26:20] <b-ot> Cork: true
[04:26:26] <xqo> oh i get it
[04:26:31] <xqo> this seems very hacky
[04:26:39] <Cork> not really
[04:26:42] <xqo> oh its just for the bot
[04:26:55] <Cork> it is to get a true/false display value
[04:27:33] <Cork> js> if("") { print('empty') } else { print("something" }
[04:27:39] <b-ot> Cork: No output.
[04:27:44] <Cork> uh
[04:27:48] <Cork> opps
[04:27:50] <Cork> js> if("") { print('empty') } else { print("something") }
[04:27:55] <b-ot> Cork: something
[04:27:57] <Cork> js> if("s") { print('empty') } else { print("something") }
[04:28:04] <b-ot> Cork: empty
[04:28:09] <Cork> heh except i typed the wrong value :x
[04:28:12] <Cork> XD
[04:30:37] <rootcoma> that's a strange quirk
[04:31:43] <Cork> rootcoma: that's nothing
[04:33:00] <SprkDev> I am having a bit of a difficulty here. I want an image crop plugin where I can select the image I want to crop. The problem is, I want the cropoped image to be saved as the wordpress avatar image. How do I do that?
[04:33:20] <xqo> how do i access 'this' within a function that is nested in a prototype-function? do i need to pass it as an argument?
[04:33:35] <xqo> i get this: http://jsfiddle.net/WwjJ6/
[04:33:40] <Cork> rootcoma: the classical one is
[04:33:44] <Cork> js> print(Array(16).join('a'-1) + ' Batman')
[04:33:49] <Cork> :)
[04:33:49] <b-ot> Cork: NaNNaNNaNNaNNaNNaNNaNNaNNaNNaNNaNNaNNaNNaNNaN Batman
[04:34:44] <SprkDev> ????
[04:34:53] <Cork> xqo: what line?
[04:35:01] <xqo> Cork 17 and 21
[04:35:06] <xqo> they give the typeerror in the html window
[04:35:13] <Cork> ajh
[04:35:22] <doev> "var row = $('#fm_update').serialize();" works an results in a string ...&...&... but "var row = $('#fm_update').serializeArray();" is undefined, why?
[04:35:31] <Cork> xqo: var self = this; on line 13
[04:35:38] <Cork> and use self in the callbacks
[04:35:49] <xqo> Cork thanks!
[04:36:33] <rootcoma> Cork, very nice
[04:36:41] <Cork> doev: either your not using jquery, or a really old version
[04:36:47] <doev> noo, it works, but "row.id" for example is undefined, why?
[04:37:04] <Cork> cause it doesn't return an object
[04:37:20] <Cork> row[0].key
[04:37:22] <Cork> row[0].value
[04:37:47] <Cork> doev: there is a plugin to for serializeObject
[04:37:56] <Cork> ?g jquery serializeObject
[04:37:57] <b-ot> Cork: hongymagic/jQuery.serializeObject · GitHub → https://github.com/hongymagic/jQuery.serializeObject
[04:39:16] <Cork> rootcoma: for a good laugh https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/wat
[04:40:19] <doev> row[0].value works ... but I can't be sure that id => 0
[04:40:34] <doev> the plugin helps?
[04:40:35] <Cork> doev: your missing the point
[04:40:52] <Cork> row will give you an array of all the fields in it found
[04:40:59] <Cork> one array entry for each
[04:41:11] <Cork> containing { key: "", value:"" }
[04:41:19] <Cork> opps sorry
[04:41:22] <Cork> containing { name: "", value:"" }
[04:41:22] <doev> yes, and I have to search for my key?
[04:41:36] <Cork> where values come from <input name="" value=""
[04:41:45] <Cork> doev: yes
[04:41:49] <Cork> you need to loop the array
[04:41:56] <Cork> or use serializeObject
[04:42:13] <Cork> doev: or if you always have the same number of fields, in the same position
[04:42:19] <Cork> they will always have the same index
[04:42:51] <rootcoma> Cork, I could watch something like this for hours
[04:48:03] <Syrit> Guys, I have a DropDown menu, i want to be able to clone it , and insert a copy of it if they user selected any option from it, now, if i write my code on "change" it will add many new DropDown menus, this is not what i want, i want to append only one new dropdown ..so, is there any event i should use ?
[04:50:31] <doev> Cork, perfekt the plugin works
[04:50:34] <Cork> Syrit: you would have to check if you have a clone ready and if you do don't insert one
[04:50:54] <Cork> Syrit: and no change is the closest event you got
[04:52:02] <Syrit> hmm, actually i thought about that, and i thought about adding some kind of variable, and incrementing it after change, and checking it before append, but actually, what i want is, if they user selected an option from the newly appended select, to append a new select as well, and so on ..Cork
[04:52:12] <doev> Cork, the plugin is executed after document finished load? (function($){ ... and place a new function to "$.fn.serializeObjec ...", is $.fn the api for forms?
[04:52:32] <Cork> Syrit: or just run a selector and see if you have an empty select there
[04:53:03] <Syrit> what do you mean run selector ?
[04:53:10] <Cork> doev: it extends jquery, it doesn't depend on document.load
[04:53:20] <Cork> Syrit: well if you do parent.append()
[04:53:59] <Cork> you could do if(parent.find('select').filter(function() { return $(tjhis).val() != "" }).length > 0) {}
[04:54:04] <Cork> or rather < 1
[04:54:25] <Cork> that way it only adds a dropdown if you don't have anyone that doesn't have a value selected
[04:54:41] <Cork> though it will depend on the dropdowns having a <option value="">select something</option>
[04:56:28] <vince164> hello
[04:57:13] <vince164> is therea away for jquery not to affect links on a object that has a fadein
[04:57:36] <Cork> "links on an object"?
[04:57:49] <vince164> i have a background that fades in and out but i dont wan tthe links to fade aswell
[04:57:57] <Cork> ah
[04:58:03] <Cork> it is how css works
[04:58:17] <Syrit> Thank you cork
[04:58:22] <Cork> if you change opacity of a parent it affects all content
[04:58:28] <Syrit> Cork, Thanks
[04:58:30] <Cork> Syrit: np
[04:58:43] <vince164> yes thank you :) so i guess i cant do much
[04:58:52] <Cork> vince164: sure you can
[04:59:02] <Cork> add an extra div make in position: relative;
[04:59:24] <Cork> add an extra div with position: fixed; and z-index: 0;
[04:59:31] <Cork> add z-index: 1; on the extra div
[04:59:41] <Cork> and have the fixed one be the background
[04:59:43] <Cork> and fade it
[04:59:45] <Cork> should work fine
[04:59:55] <vince164> ok i will try it thanks
[05:06:41] <doev> I still stuck: http://pastebin.com/yEM6YGQE   ajax is not sending an request and there is no error message.
[05:20:53] <grafi> im not sure $.ajax({}, 'json') is valid
[05:20:54] <grafi> ...
[05:23:20] <Cork> it isn't
[05:23:37] <Cork> O_o'
[05:24:39] <Cork> though dataType isn't needed if the server works correctly
[05:24:55] <Cork> so jquery most likely just ignores the 'json' string
[05:25:05] <Cork> uh...
[05:25:09] <grafi> or not ^^
[05:25:21] <Cork> doev: your giving url + it do type
[05:25:28] <Cork> and put to url ?!?
[05:25:38] <Cork> it==id
[05:25:47] <grafi> ^^
[05:25:54] <grafi> a clusterfuck
[05:25:55] <grafi> :p
[05:26:22] <Cork> doev: http://pastebin.com/BTr0xXB3 should work better
[05:29:32] <xqo> how is javascripts garbage collection? do i need to remove unused objects and whatnot?
[05:33:29] <xqo> ive made some objects, now i want to get the object associated with a certain element when i click the element. but I dont know how to "associate" the object with the element
[05:33:34] <xqo> how could i tie an element on the page to a javascript object?
[05:35:03] <xqo> is there some better way than looping through an array of my objects and making a getObjectByElementId function? :\
[05:37:09] <doev> Cork, sorry, was afk .... but, yes, I switched type and url ... -.~
[05:40:04] <msafi> Hi! I'm reading the documentation here http://api.jqueryui.com/sortable/ and there are multiple references to something called "helper". What exactly is that?
[05:43:16] <limpc> hi guys, im having a problem with drag/drop.  when a user drags an image from a webpage  to my site's drop area, the drop area redirects to the image url. how do i stop this from happening?
[05:43:31] <limpc> e.preventDefault(); e.stopPropagation(); don't stop it
[05:46:15] <limpc> nobody awake?
[05:46:24] <Velveeta> nope
[05:46:30] <limpc> :/
[05:46:40] <limpc> ive been struggling with this problem since last thursday
[05:47:05] <Velveeta> can you put up a jsfiddle example, or point to a live version online?
[05:49:59] <sebbON> hello there, I'm trying to use jquery to dynamically ad a fb-login button to my webpage. But the browser somehoe doesn't register the fb-login-button tag.. It can however display a generic html button
[05:50:30] <sebbON> function FBbutton()
[05:50:30] <sebbON> {
[05:50:30] <sebbON> 	$( "#user" ).html("<fb:login-button></fb:login-button>");
[05:50:30] <sebbON> }
[05:51:25] <sebbON> shows nothing, but if change it to $( "#user" ).html("<button> click me </button>
[05:51:27] <sebbON> i get a button
[05:51:39] <sebbON> i have the facebook api referenced
[05:52:01] <limpc> Velveeta: http://jsfiddle.net/8Uwg6/3/
[05:52:45] <limpc> Velveeta: im trying to drag this image for example: http://www.for-girls-only.com/post/68774176115/shes-definitely-got-style
[05:53:13] <limpc> oops forgot to add jquery. here's the update: http://jsfiddle.net/8Uwg6/4/
[05:53:31] <grafi> cant open it, says for girls only :p
[05:53:33] <Velveeta> sebbon: that looks like there's a specific namespace and stylesheet you need to import to provide styling guidelines for it, are you pulling in that namespace?
[05:54:17] <sebbON> erm no, I'm quite new to this. Have mostly done c# and java programming before :P
[05:55:19] <Velveeta> sebbon: i would say start down that path of googling, look up what namespaces are required for fb's markup, and look at example implementations
[05:55:50] <Velveeta> limpc: looks like what's happening is the browser's default action before it's hitting your code
[05:56:10] <Velveeta> since your window doesn't have focus, it's probably not even paying attention to the js in it when someone drags an image into it
[05:56:20] <Velveeta> it just assumes they want to navigate to the source of that image
[05:57:59] <Velveeta> sebbon: i'd also start with some generic searches for things like "fb:login-button doesn't display"
[05:58:46] <sebbON> well, I guess i'll just have to google abit more
[05:59:11] <limpc> Velveeta: how do i stop it?
[05:59:20] <Velveeta> limpc: i don't know if you can
[06:00:29] <limpc> oh nm i figured it out
[06:00:38] <limpc> have to call e.preventDefault() on dragover event
[06:00:39] <Velveeta> oh yeah?
[06:00:47] <Velveeta> interesting
[06:00:58] <Velveeta> well i'll file that one away in case i ever come across it again :D
[06:01:00] <limpc> yeah guess thats where it sets things in motion
[06:01:48] <msafi> How do I debug the effects of a mouse drag while I'm dragging? I only have one mouse on the screen...
[06:01:55] <Bauer> Cork: are you still around? :)
[06:02:07] <Cork> sure
[06:02:25] <Velveeta> msafi: you can set a breakpoint and pause your code in mid-drag so you can debug it as if the drag is in progress
[06:02:35] <Bauer> the Flash guy created a new flash: https://www.ccc.co.il/App_Themes/Banner/Cloud/Store/vCloud.swf it now has a Pointer, and he says he did click event to trigger the function
[06:03:05] <Bauer> but nothing happens when I remove the wrapping div, and click directly on the Flash banner in IE9, and Chrome. https://cloud.ccccloud.com/index.php?service=vm
[06:03:14] <Bauer> right now the cover wrapper div is commented out
[06:03:54] <msafi> Velveeta, nice. Though the dragging is managed by minified jQuery UI sortable function and I just wanna check the CSS while drag is in progress...
[06:04:32] <okp> Hi there. Anyone else has problems accessing http://try.jquery.com/ ? (error 500)
[06:04:37] <Velveeta> msafi: you can still check the css while dragging is in process, because it'll pause the script while it's happening, and you can then inspect the element that's being dragged
[06:04:45] <Cork> Bauer: you can't use jquery as these are callbacks
[06:05:02] <msafi> Velveeta, but where do I put the breakpoint?
[06:05:03] <Cork> Bauer: but you should be able to do this.pointer = function() {};
[06:05:03] <Velveeta> as for minified jquery ui stuff, if you're debugging in chrome, you can use the prettyprint option in the debugger to explode that minified js into something with line numbers
[06:05:09] <Bauer> Cork: what do you mean? cant use jquery where?
[06:05:17] <Cork> Bauer: where this is the object/embed element
[06:05:28] <Velveeta> okp: working for me
[06:05:30] <Cork> Bauer: to know when flash is clicked
[06:05:46] <Bauer> Cork: it is inside $('#vCloud-Wrapper-Div')
[06:05:51] <Cork> huh?
[06:06:17] <Cork> Bauer: when you talk with flash it check for properties on the element and calls them
[06:06:25] <Bauer> Cork: I told the guy to do this inside the Flash when it has click event: PerformAction({Group:'VM' , Platform:'vCloud'});
[06:06:25] <Velveeta> it hurts my heart to know that there are still 'flash guy's out there creating 'new flash'es...
[06:06:36] <okp> Velveeta: I get the message "We're sorry, but something went wrong."
[06:06:37] <Velveeta> a piece of my soul dies everytime a new flash file hits teh intarwebz
[06:06:46] <Cork> Bauer: you need to hook into that; if that is what you meant by "Pointer, and he says he did click event to trigger the function"
[06:06:57] <Cork> Bauer: ask your flash guy if you need more info
[06:06:59] <Velveeta> okp: weird, could it be a caching issue? have you tried dumping your cache or loading it in an incognito window?
[06:07:29] <okp> Velveeta: yup, tried
[06:07:44] <Bauer> Cork: what to ask him? waht I meant by "Pointer" is not related - only that previously there was no "Hand" cursor onmouseover the Flash... in addition to the missing Click event
[06:07:52] <Velveeta> okp: weird, it came right up on my end
[06:09:09] <Cork> Bauer: not sure how that fixes anything
[06:09:25] <Cork> Bauer: what you need is to be passed the info from flash when the user clicks in it
[06:09:27] <okp> Velveeta: damn indeed, it's my connexion at work. (ok on my mobile phone network)
[06:09:50] <Cork> Bauer: but really i'm no expert in flash, so i can't really help you how to solve it
[06:10:13] <Bauer> Cork: can you give a link which explains what you are referring to? so I perhaps could mail the Flash designer with what he needs to do exactly... because he says he has never done Javascript function invocation from inside Flash event
[06:10:20] <Velveeta> okp: your carrier is conspiring against you to prevent you from trying jquery
[06:11:10] <okp> Velveeta: i guess so. Or the NSA.
[06:11:21] <Velveeta> they-who-must-not-be-named
[06:11:44] <okp> i'm doomed then
[06:12:03] <Cork> Bauer: http://forums.adobe.com/message/3812377
[06:12:20] <gvo> would a proxy help okp?
[06:12:38] <Velveeta> bauser: also, http://lmgtfy.com/?q=making+flash+call+javascript
[06:13:11] <Cork> Bauer: but again, you should prob ask someone else about this, i've stayed clear of flash for all time, so don't know too much about the inner workings
[06:13:13] <okp> gvo: i guess, but no urge, tho
[06:13:20] <gvo> OK
[06:13:27] * Velveeta high-fives Cork.
[06:13:30] <okp> Bauer: what's the issue exactly ?
[06:13:44] <Velveeta> when working with flash, it's always best to not work with flash
[06:13:53] <gvo> +1
[06:14:08] <Cork> okp: he have flash images and want to use them for click actions
[06:14:27] <Cork> but as it is plugins the event doesn't bubble to the dom
[06:14:31] <gvo> When I visit a page with flash and it works, OK but if it doesn't I go find something else to do.
[06:14:37] <okp> (why Flash images is not the question, here, i guess...)
[06:14:39] <Velveeta> okp: i think he's trying to figure out how to make a click on an embedded flash object trigger a javascript function with info about the click event
[06:14:56] <Cork> okp: it was, last week :)
[06:15:53] <okp> Bauer: so you want to use Flash images, and trigger JS click events on them ?
[06:16:14] <Velveeta> okp: that sounds about right from my understanding of the problem...
[06:16:20] <Cork> ya
[06:16:35] <Bauer> okp: yes, was about to write the story to you from beginning :) essentially, we need to trigger this in JS: PerformAction({Group:'VM' , Platform:'vCloud'});  when flash banner is clicked...
[06:17:06] <Bauer> okp: we worked around the problem in most broswers with cover div and z-index, but it doesnt work in IE9
[06:17:26] <Velveeta> animated gif in place of flash image, *boom*, problem solved! :D
[06:17:38] <grafi> boom
[06:17:40] <Cork> :)
[06:17:42] <Cork> or svg
[06:17:45] <Cork> even nicer
[06:17:56] <okp> Using Flash for using Flash, i think the best bet is to triccger click actions inside the Flash itself
[06:18:19] <okp> +1 Velveeta / Cork
[06:18:24] <Velveeta> okp: i think that's gonna be what has to happen, but they'd like that click action within the actionscript, to execute a js function as well
[06:18:36] <Velveeta> to kick off that PerformAction() function in the js
[06:18:43] <okp> that's not a pb
[06:18:48] <Cork> git st
[06:18:50] <Cork> opps
[06:19:05] <okp> You can trigger JS functions from the actionscript in Flash
[06:19:30] <Cork> it is prob better to have it call a generic handler instead
[06:19:42] <Velveeta> well then lay down some knowledge okp :)
[06:19:43] <Cork> it SUCKS if you need to change something and need to recombile flash to do it
[06:20:05] * Velveeta passes the mic to okp, with a backup mic for Cork.
[06:20:13] <okp> Sure, but calling a genereic function will do the trick
[06:20:13] <Velveeta> preach it, you 2
[06:21:17] <Bauer> okp: how do you sugest to convert the example Cork linked to: ExternalInterface.call("ff",yourbutton.name); to use the parameter ({Group:'VM' , Platform:'vCloud'})
[06:22:14] <Velveeta> writing that line about passing the mic made me want to put on some young mc
[06:22:24] <Velveeta> it probably should have made me put on beastie boys instead, but nope..
[06:22:33] <okp> Bauer: yourbutton.nam is a parameter you pass to you ff() function
[06:22:37] <okp> you can pass whatever you want
[06:22:51] <okp> (whatever is available from inside the Flash)
[06:23:01] <Bauer> okp: so just replacing it with {Group:'VM' , Platform:'vCloud'} is the correct syntax in action script?
[06:24:37] <okp> these parameters are variable depending on your different buttuns ?
[06:25:54] <Bauer> no okp, each flash would have only static parameter call
[06:27:12] <okp> Bauer: ok then, check this example: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/435763/how-do-i-pass-information-between-flashs-externalinterface-and-javascript
[06:28:31] <okp> in AS, you can do ExternalInterface.call("yourJSFunction",{Group:'VM' , Platform:'vCloud'});
[06:29:16] <okp> but again, without knowing all the thing, and what object and variable is corresponding to what, hard to say for sure
[06:29:51] <pedda> shoky are you still around ?
[06:30:14] <shoky> pedda i'm around ;p
[06:30:40] <okp> and your JS function will be yourJSFunction(obj){window.alert(obj.Group+"-"+obj.Platform);}
[06:30:41] <Bauer> thanks okp, that looks good - passing to the stupid idiot flasher now :) will update with results :)
[06:30:44] <pedda> it looks as if i have figured out a bit more how tu implement my slideshow..
[06:30:55] <pedda> but i'm still unsure about some facts
[06:31:08] <shoky> pedda you'll have to remind me...
[06:31:19] <pedda> for instance, when should i call initAnimation, what about image sizes at that time and so on
[06:31:44] <pedda> jquery boilerplate + kineticjs -> canvas based slideshow jquery plugin for use with a cms
[06:31:53] <okp> Bauer: again, try to see if Flash is really needed here... Seems its not
[06:32:37] <Bauer> okp: but how to convert that damned animation affect inot gif? the "flasher" says its not possible
[06:32:58] <pedda> would you mind to take a look at the code and give me some hints?
[06:33:00] <shoky> pedda: oh. welp i can't really answer your question without seeing what you're doing.. also i don't know kineticjs
[06:33:00] <pedda> http://pastebin.com/Bm5HmhUp
[06:33:19] <okp> Bauer: Change your flasher ;)
[06:33:48] <okp> Bauer: are these Flash visible somehow ? so I can check
[06:33:53] <pedda> imagine kineticjs is no wizardry, it's for setting up a stage, layers, groups with child nodes like text or image nodes to handle the components of a slideshow within canvas
[06:34:24] <pedda> i have no issues with kineticjs, its rather a misconception of mine how to implement the plugin
[06:34:33] <pedda> just ignore the kineticjs stuff
[06:34:56] <shoky> pedda: i now remember i told you you can use deferreds to split up your callbacks.. and you're doing that, but you're splitting them in the same place.. like in line 189  why shouldn't that block be inside the "load" callback?
[06:35:04] <pedda> yes you did
[06:35:14] <pedda> and it works .. partially :)
[06:35:23] <pedda> i have an issue with that one though
[06:35:29] <Bauer> yes okp, you can check it out here: https://cloud.ccccloud.com/index.php?service=vm just run $('div.cover').remove(); to remove our cover div workaround (which doesnt work in IE9)
[06:35:31] <pedda> or i'm just not getting it
[06:35:34] <timwis> Hey guys, I have an array of promises, and I'm doing $.when.apply($, promises).done(...).fail(...) -- in my fail(), how can I tell which promise failed?
[06:36:05] <pedda> my current issue is, i want some vertical scrolling, if enabled, for the image within a slide… i geht the height of 0 for the first one and i don#t know why
[06:36:23] <pedda> i'm not sure if it's the wrong order of methods i call, or at the wrong place..
[06:37:08] <shoky> timwis: not sure if there's a simple way to know, without looping over the array and checking the promises' statuses
[06:37:49] <pedda> what i basically want to achieve is: i fetch data from json (captions and images), prepare my components for the slideshow, run animation in loop
[06:37:53] <shoky> pedda: sorry you're asking many things at once.. make a demo jsfiddle focusing on one problem
[06:38:00] <pedda> okay
[06:38:04] <shoky> try to keep it minimal if possible
[06:38:09] <pedda> okay
[06:38:16] <okp> Bauer: Flash -> Save as -> Animated GIF.
[06:39:20] <Bauer> lol okp, he just replied to me: this is in AS3 i don't know this language only AS2 - is there any difference? is your syntax not the same in AS2?
[06:39:26] <okp> Bauer: sorry: Flash -> Export -> Export Movie -> Animated Gif
[06:39:47] <okp> Bauer: indeed, things are different in AS2
[06:40:39] <okp> Bauer: seriously, change your Flasher...
[06:42:11] <okp> Bauer: I can't recall how it is done in AS2, didn't practice since years...
[06:42:51] <Bauer> I will wait for his final reply.. if he cant fulfil, I will go to the boss who hired them and tell them that :P
[06:43:02] <okp> Bauer: But ExternalInterface seems available in AS2
[06:44:01] <okp> Bauer: again, Gifs will make your life easier, there
[06:46:01] <okp> Bauer: The syntaxt seems the same in AS2, btw
[06:46:36] <joroci> do what in as3?
[06:46:57] <okp> joroci: call a JS function
[06:47:31] <pedda> shoky http://jsfiddle.net/wikipeter/khrj8/
[06:47:48] <pedda> this is my current state of the slider
[06:48:25] <joroci> var r:URLRequest = new URLRequest("javascript:functionName()");
[06:48:31] <joroci> navigateToURL(r,'_self');
[06:48:36] <pedda> first issue is: first image scrolls down (even if there is no - right before the imageOffset) -> this happens because image height for the first item is = 0
[06:48:43] <joroci> like that
[06:48:52] <okp> joroci: I prefer using ExternalInterface, personnaly
[06:49:24] <joroci> you can do that too
[06:49:49] <joroci> who asked it?
[06:51:39] <okp> joroci: Bauer asked for the function in AS2. But it's for his flasher to do it (for uselessly Flash-made buttons)
[06:55:11] <Bauer> okp: he says the only way there are no compilation errors is: ExternalInterface.call("( “PerformAction”, {Group:'VM' , Platform:'vCloud'} )");
[06:55:50] <okp> Bauer: those multiple double quotes are strange
[06:55:51] <Bauer> inside a btn1.onPress = function()
[06:56:10] <Bauer> okp: he says unless he quotes the whole thing, it doesnt compile
[06:56:15] <shoky> pedda: sorry dude it's taking me too long to figure out what's going on there.. and not knowing kineticjs or what youre doing with it is making it hard. not sure i can help ya
[06:56:34] <pedda> hmm okay
[06:56:54] <pedda> as mentioned, it's more a deferred related issue i have now
[06:57:10] <shoky> you don't need the deferred there, it's not really helping
[06:57:19] <pedda> okay, this is a first hint
[06:57:21] <shoky> but i don't see any issue related to it, anyway
[06:57:31] <pedda> the first image is scrolling down
[06:57:36] <pedda> it should scroll up...
[06:57:43] <pedda> but the height of it is 0
[06:57:51] <shoky> that's an issue yes.. but i dont see it being related to the deferred
[06:57:54] <pedda> for the second image the proper image offset/height is calculated
[06:58:02] <pedda> ah okay
[06:58:07] <commander__> Hi i have an issue, When using slidetoggle on a div that i got it jumps up and down several times. I tried removing padding, adding overflow etc but it still jumps..
[06:58:40] <pedda> maybe the only issue is, that i'm not good at writing an jquery plugin ;)
[06:59:06] <Amnesia> Hi, I'm trying to use $.ajax, unfortunately it's stating that the supplied json is invalid, but the json is actually valid. How exactly could I debug this?
[06:59:10] <commander__> slide down works but thing is that i got x divs that need to slide up and down and im not sure how to workarround this...
[06:59:31] <shoky> pedda nah you seem to be doing fine. just running into an issue ;p
[07:00:07] <pedda> it took my quite long to understand that i can't fetch image dimensions until they're not loaded
[07:00:23] <pedda> you pointed me to the deferred approach, which helped me to move on
[07:00:48] <pedda> it's still confusing for me to decide where to call my methods..
[07:01:13] <okp> Bauer: this should work: ExternalInterface.call("jsFunction","hello")
[07:01:15] <pedda> as waiting until images have loaded, requires me to call method, when this event hs passed
[07:01:17] <pedda> *has
[07:01:59] <shoky> i dont really understand the effect you're looking for, with that scrolling
[07:02:03] <okp> Bauer: and in JS: jsFunction(txt){window.alert(txt);} //displays hello
[07:02:12] <pedda> but how do i still stick to a plugins structure and handle some reader friendly init method which sets up the structure for my slideshow?
[07:02:20] <shoky> pedda: anyway here it is without the deferred, its the same behaviour i think  http://jsfiddle.net/khrj8/2/
[07:02:32] <okp> Bauer: got 2 go, sorry. good luck ;)
[07:03:18] <pedda> shoky: the plan is, this is a slideshow for an info screen in a museum, some images are landscape and some are portrait, the editor in a cms has the option to enable vertical scrolling
[07:04:01] <pedda> to display art pieces in full size while the image is scrolling during the transitionDuration
[07:04:56] <pedda> this is a 46 inch screen, and strecthing a portrait image requires me to scale it and scroll it afterwards, as it is so large
[07:05:13] <shoky> oh, scrolling just so you can see all of it?
[07:05:21] <pedda> exactly
[07:05:25] <shoky> k
[07:05:28] <pedda> it should scroll very slowly
[07:05:36] <pedda> this is just a "side-animation"
[07:05:44] <pedda> for certain slides
[07:05:47] <shoky> gotcha. sortof
[07:06:03] <pedda> and it's failing by now, because the first image has a height of 0
[07:06:07] <shoky> but it's still too much unfamiliar code to wade through ;[
[07:06:13] <pedda> okay
[07:06:33] <pedda> in my opinion i rely too much on self and this..
[07:06:50] <pedda> i don'T feel comfortable with it, but i don't know if this is common
[07:07:10] <pedda> i never did a jquery plugin before..
[07:07:39] <pedda> and it turns out as writing a well structured plugin is a hard task :)
[07:07:40] <Bauer> okp: he also tried on (release) {	getURL("javascript:PerformAction('{Group:'VM' , Platform:'vCloud'}')");} and this too gives error Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected identifier
[07:08:37] <shoky> pedda: something that looks bad is that you're setting and relying on a global "stage" variable
[07:09:06] <pedda> do i?
[07:09:15] <pedda> it is initialized within init() method
[07:09:22] <pedda> does it become global dthat way?
[07:09:27] <shoky> pedda: yea, in initKineticStage you're setting it globally
[07:09:33] <shoky> pedda:   stage = ...;
[07:09:38] <shoky> instead of var stage = ...;
[07:09:56] <pedda> tbh. i was wondering why i don't struggle with stage, but with all other vars :P
[07:10:04] <shoky> pedda: and then, inside the deferred.done callback you're doing stage.draw() on that global one
[07:10:14] <shoky> heh
[07:10:22] <pedda> the stage.draw makes my images appear at all :)
[07:10:36] <shoky> should probably be  self.stage.draw()
[07:10:38] <pedda> i bet i can drop that line somewhere else
[07:10:46] <shoky> (and you'd need to set self.stage somewhere)
[07:11:46] <shoky> Bauer:  that javascript has unescaped quotes in a string
[07:11:57] <shoky> '{Group:'VM' , Platform:'vCloud'}'    no good
[07:15:45] <Bauer> yeah.. well shoky he should send me the original flash file I will have my friend look into it later today, and tomorrow his "programmer" should see about the correct syntax...
[07:15:48] * Bauer facepalms
[07:16:15] <joroci> any loop experts :P/
[07:16:16] <joroci> ?
[07:16:36] <joroci> how can i make a timeout in my loop to slow it down?
[07:16:52] <pedda> shoky thx a lot.. those few hints helped me a lot once again :D
[07:17:03] <Syrit> Guys, I wonder if there is a "Better practice" or a way to imporve this code ? https://gist.github.com/anonymous/7750983 , Basically, it always appends a new select tag for the user to select from..
[07:17:06] <pedda> i'm cleaning up parts of the mess :)
[07:19:12] <Deas> anyone have any suggestions to how i can make a ajax call only when the database actually changed? it'd be a waste to have a loop to get the same info over and over again
[07:19:52] <Deas> ajax->php->mysql
[07:20:10] <Siraris> I'm using .prop('checked', true) to check a checkbox, yet the checkbox is not showing that it's being ticked.  Does anyone know why this would be?
[07:20:32] <work_> How can I make this work: http://jsfiddle.net/7N4pg/ I want to bind each click with anohter value, but currently I only get the last value 3
[07:20:39] <BAMbanda> How can I get the value of a checkbox, to see weather it is checked or not?
[07:21:02] <BAMbanda> $('.mycheckbox'). what?
[07:21:16] <work_> $('#cbox').attr('checked');
[07:21:30] <BAMbanda> work_ ok, I was trying .prop and it wasn't working
[07:22:37] <Siraris> $('.mycheckbox').prop('checked') should work
[07:23:03] <BAMbanda> Siraris, actually I forgot the "." portion to refer to a classname!
[07:23:07] <BAMbanda> that's why it wan't working
[07:24:17] <Siraris> I wish I knew why it wasn't checking my checkbox, especially when it wasn't before
[07:24:26] <vince360> i cant figure this out, maybe someone else can spot what im doing wrong
[07:24:27] <vince360> http://jsfiddle.net/8zaY4/
[07:24:38] <vince360> the first 2 lists load but the 3rd list dose not get called
[07:25:07] <shoky> Siraris: is it a regular checkbox? or enhanced by some ui lib?
[07:25:49] <Siraris> shoky: Regular.  It's worked for months too
[07:26:33] <vince360> any ideas why my code is not working
[07:26:41] <shoky> Siraris oks well that should work yea.. give a link or jsfiddle if you want help with it
[07:27:18] <vince164> hey shoky can you have a look at my code http://jsfiddle.net/8zaY4/
[07:27:31] <Siraris> shoky: haha my fiddle would consist of <input type="checkbox" id="check-0" /> $('#check-0').prop('checked', 'checked').  I also tried ('checked', true)
[07:27:41] <vince164> first and second list work but the 3rd one dose not get called
[07:28:13] <shoky> Siraris: yea that's why i said "a link" first ;p
[07:28:25] <Siraris> shoky: I can't show you my live code as it's in a secure location.
[07:28:33] <Siraris> shoky: And I can't really give you access :(
[07:29:18] <Velveeta> vince164: http://jsfiddle.net/8zaY4/2/
[07:29:24] <shoky> vince164: in InOut2 you're calling InOut instead of Inout2 i think
[07:29:34] <Velveeta> shoky: that's it
[07:29:44] <Velveeta> i was in the middle of typing it out when you hit enter :D
[07:29:50] <shoky> ;p
[07:29:55] <vince164> ahh thank you guys
[07:30:37] <shoky> Siraris: welp check that you don't have maybe duplicate ids :S
[07:30:52] <Siraris> shoky: Yep, when i do a select it says count = 1 :(
[07:30:58] <shoky> Siraris: a select on what?
[07:31:04] <Siraris> shoky: On the ID I'm searching for
[07:31:12] <shoky> Siraris:  $('[id="check-0"]')   is the right check
[07:31:18] <shoky> not $('#check-0')
[07:31:26] <shoky> that'd return just the first
[07:31:56] <Siraris> shoky: k
[07:32:05] <Siraris> Why does that make a diff?
[07:32:31] <shoky> cause $('#id') uses document.getElementById  which just returns one element
[07:33:48] <shoky> (while [id=".."]  is really  *[id=".."]  which goes through every element checking its id attribute)
[07:34:17] <Siraris> shoky: Interesting that [id] wouldn[t.  But yes, when I do a select it looks like there's 2!  Now if only I knew where the other one was haha
[07:34:38] <shoky> that's easy to check in firebug or devtools
[07:35:22] <shoky> $('[id="check-0"]').get()
[07:35:31] <shoky> should print out the elements and you can inspect them
[07:39:54] <Siraris> shoky: Can't seem to find the first one, the second one shows up though
[07:39:55] <commander__> anyone knows how to fix jumping slidetoggle?
[07:40:20] <Siraris> shoky: Ah I found it!
[07:40:28] <shoky> woot
[07:42:15] <commander__> tried doing this = http://codepad.org/3R8aGyda
[07:42:38] <commander__> but even then it jumps up and down. Commenting out slide up and it works ok but not beeing able to slide up ofc...
[07:42:49] <commander__> any ideas?
[07:43:07] <shoky> commander__: make a minimal demo jsfiddle showing the problem
[07:51:54] <commander__> shoky: hm not sure how exactly to do a minimal demo on this its hm
[07:53:44] <Bloomberg> Hello Guys!!
[07:54:37] <Bloomberg> I'm getting this error   :::    TypeError: $.browser is undefined
[07:58:27] <jugglinmike> Bloomberg: That property is no longer defined as of jQuery 1.9.
[07:58:34] <jugglinmike> See http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.browser/ for more
[08:05:58] <commander__> shoky: http://jsfiddle.net/8snX3/
[08:06:29] <commander__> not sure how to make it slide there but that is atleast my code mostly..
[08:06:45] <shoky> commander__: include jquery  http://jsfiddle.net/8snX3/1/
[08:07:13] <shoky> why do you have <li>'s in a <div> :\
[08:07:49] <commander__> hm it works thee though odd
[08:08:47] <commander__> yeah it seems odd when i think of it..
[08:11:03] <commander__> shoky: hm im using chromium and it jumps up and down on each element but the last
[08:11:23] <shoky> commander__  try adding overflow:hidden to the toggled div i donno..
[08:13:19] <commander__> shoky: hm looking in chromium debug it's hidden
[08:13:29] <commander__> firefox behaves the same.
[08:14:20] <shoky> looking and adding isn't the same thing
[08:14:32] <commander__> shoky: if im not clear enough about the issue, it expands the div, then colapses it and then expands it again etc....
[08:14:53] <shoky> only seeing the issue would make it clear enough
[08:15:13] <commander__> video tape it :P hm odd
[08:15:44] <shoky> tried adding overflow:hidden ..?
[08:16:49] <commander__> shoky: yes
[08:19:19] <hugo_m> how can i get the equivalent of wheel delta for iOS?
[08:19:43] <hugo_m> i need to know if there is a delta scrolled upward or downward
[08:22:35] <c--__> is there a jquery function or plugin to forbid certain numbers in a number field (<input type="number">) (or alternatively exclude certain strings in a textbox)?
[08:25:17] <Forbidd3n> How would I remove all elements that do not contain a specific class?
[08:27:04] <hfp> Hi guys, 1 question: I used the theme roller and it gave me two css files. One is nicely formatted and readable CSS, the other one is on three lines and called "min". I understand the min version is as small as possible and is what has to be served to visitors to save on traffic but how to I merge my edits in the nicely formatted version to the min version? Is there a tool of some sorts? Thanks
[08:28:02] <Velveeta> hfp: you can use a minifier to automatically strip out whitespace, semicolons, etc to create a minified version as part of your deployment process… which one you choose depends on what your development environment is like
[08:28:05] <shoky> hfp: you're not supposed to edit the css files at all. you're supposed to add your own css file(s) and override whatever you want
[08:28:22] <Velveeta> damnit shoky, with the better logic....
[08:28:26] <hfp> shoky: Ah ok!
[08:28:29] <shoky> ;p
[08:29:10] <hfp> shoky: Also, would you have a webpage to recommend I read to produce clean CSS? I comment every single CSS entry but I would like to know what best practice is.
[08:29:36] <Birliban> Hi, can i simply write this into multiple lines, just for better readability? $("<tr class='result'><td>"+j[i].con1r+"</td><td>"+j[i].top+"</td><td>" + j[i].consultantFirstName + " " + j[i].consultantLastName + "</td><td>"+j[i].time+"</td></tr>").appendTo('#monthlyConsultReport');
[08:30:31] <shoky> hfp mm don't know really. anything other than w3schools ;s
[08:30:51] <hfp> shoky:  keep reading w3schools is evil

[08:31:38] <shoky> it is. definitely not the examples you wanna look at if you want to keep your code/css clean
[08:36:39] <Forbidd3n> is there any way to add table rows from ajax response <tr> after a specific <tr>?
[08:40:02] <BillCriswell> Forbidd3n: .after()
[08:40:43] <BillCriswell> Forbidd3n: So like $('table').find('tr').eq(32).after('<tr><td>Foo</td></tr>");
[08:40:55] <BillCriswell> Er, mismatched ' and ". You get the idea though.
[08:51:50] <clov3r> Good morning, Monday
[08:52:08] <clov3r> if I am iterating over a jquery collection
[08:52:19] <clov3r> $('.selector').each
[08:52:37] <clov3r> how do I get the reference to the next and previous nodes in the collection
[08:53:00] <Velveeta> well, the each function also passes the index of the current item in the collection
[08:53:10] <Velveeta> you could use that get the next and previous item
[08:53:20] <Velveeta> there's no built-in reference to the next or previous item though
[08:54:08] <duch_kazatel> $('.selector').each(function(index, Element){})
[08:54:13] <duch_kazatel> that's what you get.
[08:56:26] <commander__> shoky: http://jsfiddle.net/8snX3/2/
[08:56:49] <joroci> or use for loop it's faster
[08:57:07] <commander__> hm there is my whole script, not sure if it's too mutch to spot an error, but I cant honestly see anything wrong
[08:58:23] <joroci> whatt's not working
[08:58:24] <joroci> ?
[08:58:39] <shoky> commander__: it's probably a css issue.. setup your site so you can link to it or smth
[08:58:46] <commander__> joroci: im aving issues with the toggleslide
[08:58:58] <commander__> shoky: ok
[08:59:35] <joroci> yea that's better
[08:59:37] <shoky> commander__: oh wait.. the issue is that it slides down and then back up?
[08:59:46] <shoky> commander__: or that there is a small jump in the animation?
[09:00:07] <joroci> it's not even sliding to me
[09:00:29] <shoky> right.. he had an earlier one where it was fine  http://jsfiddle.net/8snX3/1/
[09:00:56] <joroci> this works fine to me
[09:01:02] <shoky> commander__: anyway. set up a fiddle or a link so we can see the issue happening
[09:01:10] <BillCriswell> clov3r: You can also do this assuming they're all siblings... $('.selector').each(function(){ var $current = $(this), $next = $current.next(), $prev = $current.prev(); });.. If they're not you can do var $foo = $('.foo'); $foo.each(function(i, el){ var $this = $(this), $prev = $foo.eq(i-1), $next = $foo.eq(i+1); });
[09:01:11] <shoky> joroci: yes it works fine
[09:01:45] <clov3r> thanks velveeta and BillCriswell
[09:01:52] <Velveeta> no problemo
[09:02:26] <joroci> what is $(this)?
[09:02:37] <duch_kazatel> the current node.
[09:02:42] <duch_kazatel> or object.
[09:03:01] <duch_kazatel> when using .each(), it's the current object the iterator is on.
[09:03:06] <joroci> lol i mean where he used it
[09:03:10] <duch_kazatel> oh hah
[09:03:22] <BillCriswell> The $() is wrapping it with jQuery.
[09:03:26] <clov3r> more generally: `$(this)` is a jquery object wrapper containing `this`,
[09:03:40] <clov3r> and `this` is the current scope
[09:04:16] <clov3r> inside a loop, this refers to the object currently  iterated
[09:04:34] <clov3r> *$.each() loop
[09:04:53] <clov3r> and is often a DOM node
[09:05:28] <clov3r> y'all have a good turkey day?
[09:05:31] <clov3r> :)
[09:05:44] <BillCriswell> It wasn't bad.
[09:07:23] <commander__> shoky: joroci http://dvwebb.mah.se/m10p2603/
[09:07:54] <commander__> go to menu top left -> Sök Film -> Search for something and enjoy
[09:08:07] <commander__> top right*
[09:08:30] <shoky> enjoy? :)
[09:08:46] <commander__> the bouncyness :P
[09:08:59] <shoky> Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'length' of undefined
[09:09:21] <shoky> oh guess i searched for something invalid?
[09:09:35] <shoky> ye.
[09:09:39] <commander__> dunno
[09:09:48] <shoky> no movies with "hehe" in their title i guess.
[09:09:57] <shoky> that's a shame :|
[09:10:20] <commander__> try some porn they got lots of it and hillarious titles :P
[09:10:21] <shoky> commander__: lol i had no idea this was the issue ;p
[09:11:00] <commander__> Im guessing it dances for you?
[09:11:22] <commander__> Both firefox and chromium for me, have not even tried to look at IE
[09:11:22] <shoky> yeah.. can you change it back to a simple slideToggle ?
[09:11:44] <commander__> sure
[09:13:00] <commander__> shoky: should be uploaded now
[09:13:24] <joroci> did anyone work with google contacts api?
[09:14:02] <Dessimat0r> hi, any idea why this isn't working? var $lastMsg = $chatWindow('.message-box:not(.message_notification):last');   i don't think the program flow gets beyond the point     $chatWindow is obtained by var $chatWindow = this.$('#chat-contents');, but that's not my code and works 100%
[09:15:12] <commander__> shoky: notice that the last one in the list does not experiance this issue...
[09:16:11] <shoky> commander__ eh you're returning scripts in your ajax responses?
[09:17:02] <commander__> shoky: what do you mean?
[09:19:08] <shoky> commander__: i mean in your ajax responses you've got <script> including jquery again for example, or other .js files
[09:20:46] <shoky> commander__: that makes it really annoying to debug. and it's a messy way of doing things, especially when you're binding event handlers in these scripts
[09:21:12] <commander__> im quite new to this, but i thought i had to include each script in each file to make it run
[09:21:34] <commander__> but yeah im about to move all that out, just got well cought in this one
[09:22:27] <shoky> not in files that you're injecting into an already running page
[09:27:13] <shoky> commander__: you're binding event handlers to the elements too many times
[09:28:16] <commander__> hm
[09:29:43] <shoky> commander__: i'm not sure why it's happening cause i cant put a breakpoint in that script.. can you put this as first line in search.js:   debugger;
[09:30:25] <commander__> ok
[09:33:56] <commander__> shoky: done
[09:34:24] <shoky> commander__: anyway you should use event delegation for those items.. just set up one click handler on page load, on a container element e.g.  $('body').on('click', '.movieItem', function() { $(this).children('div').slideToggle(300); })
[09:38:34] <shoky> commander__: oh.... you're calling "search" over and over again for EACH result
[09:39:01] <shoky> commander__: so obviously you'll be binding again and again..
[09:41:29] <commander__> shoky: awesome. Removed the bindings and added a delegation like you just said for both items and it looks like it works flawlessly
[09:42:06] <xqo> ive made some objects. I need to associate the objects with dom elements so that I can click an element, and grab whatever object is tied to it
[09:42:26] <xqo> how can i do that?
[09:42:32] <shoky> commander__: sweet
[09:42:38] <timwis> Hey guys, I have an array of promises, and I'm doing $.when.apply($, promises).done(...).fail(...) -- in my fail(), how can I tell which promise failed?
[09:43:14] <xqo> in a dream world, i would do $(#myElement").theObject = function() {}; but that doesnt work when you try it
[09:43:16] <shoky> timwis: not sure if there's a simple way to know, without looping over the array and checking the promises' statuses
[09:43:55] <timwis> shoky: Interesting.. do you know how to check the promise's status?
[09:44:02] <commander__> shoky: really appreciate your help with this. Also learnd about the debugger. Just used mostly notepad++ and brackets for this :P
[09:44:11] <ihsw> xqo: how do you know which object is associated with the dom element?
[09:44:25] <xqo> ihsw thats the question :P
[09:44:30] <duch_kazatel> xqo you'll need to be able to match some other way - you can't do 1:1 binding like that.
[09:44:36] <ihsw> xqo: how are those dom elements coming into existence to begin with?
[09:44:37] <xqo> well what can i try?
[09:45:04] <dcherman> xqo: see ?data
[09:45:08] <shoky> timwis: mm you can call deferredObj.state()  http://api.jquery.com/deferred.state/   not sure if it works for promises, sec.
[09:45:16] <ihsw> xqo: while creating the dom elements/writing the html, you can assign attributes to them, eg: <div class="message-comment" data-message-id="69"></div>
[09:45:19] <duch_kazatel> xqo I'd look at creating a big object, and name each prop for something in a data attribute.
[09:45:29] <dcherman> xqo: meh.  http://api.jquery.com/data/
[09:45:41] <duch_kazatel> then you can do things like myObj[dataAttrValHere]
[09:45:52] <shoky> timwis: yea seems you can use it on promises too
[09:46:18] <ihsw> xqo: assigning functions/objects to dom elements can get hacky really fast, for example if the elements get replaced then all of your data is gone
[09:46:58] <xqo> i want to store a class object (or whatever its called in js)
[09:47:28] <xqo> can .data do that?
[09:47:32] <ihsw> xqo: yeah storing things in the dom isn't really the best way to go, put some kind of data-* attribute on it -- this isn't java
[09:47:50] <ihsw> xqo: store as little as humanly possible in the dom
[09:48:10] <dcherman> xqo: read the docs for data.  and yes, it can.
[09:48:30] <xqo> ok thank you
[09:48:54] <ihsw> xqo: please don't just shove things into your .data() calls, it can get very messy very quickly
[10:00:12] <Nece228> its a stupid question but why on chromium event.preventDefault works fine even if i havent put 'event' in my brackets e.g. "function(event)" while in other browsers i get error that event is not defined
[10:01:53] <shoky> Nece228 because it's imitating a stupid global event object that was once used like that in another old browser. or something like that
[10:03:03] <jugglinmike> Nece228: shoky see http://www.quirksmode.org/js/events_access.html
[10:05:53] <Nece228> i guess its more clear now, thanks
[10:06:30] <Nece228> but should i use 'event' or 'e' letter instead?
[10:06:47] <shoky> you should use whatever you named the argument
[10:07:01] <shoky> which should be event or e, unless you want to be confusing
[10:08:00] <shoky> that is.. naming it 'event' is just fine
[10:08:18] <Nece228> yeah, but the link mentions that i have to use letter 'e' to name it, because its a standard
[10:08:33] <shoky> nah
[10:09:00] <Nece228> ok then :)
[10:09:06] <shoky> the link says:  Traditionally it is stored in the variable e — though you can use any name you like
[10:10:54] <Nece228> firefox gives me warning:  Use of getPreventDefault() is deprecated.  Use defaultPrevented instead
[10:11:51] <shoky> yeah that's fixed in jquery 1.11/2.1
[10:12:58] <Nece228> cool, because i thought i did something wrong
[10:15:34] <Dwarf> How would I hook something I write to a page with $(el).html()?
[10:23:59] <timwis> shoky, even if I figure out which promise in the array of promises is the one that failed, how do I know which fetch that was? there's not like an identifier inside the promise right?
[10:27:59] <Mehrzad> Hi
[10:28:36] <Mehrzad> I expect this code t add a number of divs to the container div. But it doesn't work. http://fiddle.jshell.net/GVPW4/ Can someone help?
[10:29:53] <duch_kazatel> Mehrzad var $container = $("#knockout-parent"); - your HTML has this: <div class="knockout-parent">
[10:30:00] <duch_kazatel> that would be a good first place to start :)
[10:31:21] <Mehrzad> duch_kazatel: Thanks
[10:31:46] <duch_kazatel> np
[10:40:31] <shoky> timwis: the promise is a jqXHR? the $.when().fail callback will have the same arguments as the jqXHR.fail, the first argument being the jqXHR itself
[10:43:52] <shoky> timwis: oh but i guess that doesn't give you the url still. hm
[10:45:08] <shoky> timwis: you can do smth like  $.ajaxSetup({ beforeSend: function(xhr, settings) { xhr.url = settings.url; } })   and then have the url in the jqXHR object
[10:45:59] <shoky> timwis: ohh or just "this.url" in the fail callback :P
[11:00:13] <grafi> this.shoky
[11:00:14] <grafi> :x
[11:04:34] <shoky> perv
[11:05:22] <grafi> haha
[11:20:06] <timwis> Thanks shoky
[11:33:21] <dnsdds> If a resource returns a status code of 418, does deferred.fail() catch it?
[11:43:58] <gordian> guys i've got a bootstrap accordion which i want to load fully expanded with clicking disabled at first, but when you click on the button it will fully collapse and enable clicking
[11:44:03] <gordian> i've made it this far: http://jsfiddle.net/silb3r/ETVmr/6/
[11:44:58] <gordian> but when i click the button to collapse the panels and enable clicking then the behavior is not accordion-like: when you click on multiple panels they all remain open instead of only the most recent panel opening and closing the rest
[11:46:09] <gordian> what am i missing?
[12:06:07] <xDarkice> What would be the best way to select all elements where all childs have the same class (I thought of something like myElem.children().length == myElem.children("the-class-every-child-must-have").length)
[12:06:48] <zizz> Hey guys I have a <span> inside an <a> that animates outside the <a> tag via this jQuery code.. http://jsfiddle.net/4S2j6/, but as the <span> sits outside the <a>, a user can hover over that area (since it's only opacity:0) and the hover action will trigger, can I disable that? or use something other than opacity that animates well?
[12:10:11] <zizz> Anyway to run these events simultaneously? .fadeIn(250).animate({ "left": "-215", },250)
[12:10:24] <zizz> instead of it fading in and then moving?
[12:14:11] <adrian_lc> jQuery datatables: does it leave alone links/button inputs inside the <td> ??
[12:17:13] <hugo_m> why can you not set the css of the html tag using query?
[12:17:15] <hugo_m> jquery
[12:22:11] <ravimiles> I have got a table with 1,000 <tr></tr> There are 4 <td></td> in each <tr>. I would like to output all four strings from all four <td>s of each <tr> in one like comma delimited. Here is how far I have gotten: http://jsfiddle.net/jRa52/
[12:28:30] <sunbeam> when i have 4 ul lists , and they all should be 25% of the total div width,
[12:28:33] <sunbeam> i mean 4 lists and having max 8 items in each list
[12:28:35] <sunbeam> (but they semantically are the same list)
[12:28:37] <sunbeam> how can I best do this?
[12:29:05] <dfletcher> well ravimiles it's not super jquery friendly but this works :) http://jsfiddle.net/jRa52/2/
[12:29:33] <dfletcher> I don't think there's a way to extract arrays with text() like you were trying to do
[12:30:28] <adrian_lc> jQuery datatables: does it leave alone links/button inputs inside the <td> ?? (user can click on them inside the table and they work)
[12:31:43] <shoky> ravimiles: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/jRa52/3/
[12:32:15] <krambiorix> what in heavens name am i doing wrong ? http://jsfiddle.net/a788H/
[12:33:15] <shoky> ravimiles: or if you want it all in one string  http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/jRa52/4/
[12:34:33] <krambiorix> shoky any idea?
[12:35:13] <shoky> krambiorix: you can't use javascript's floating point vars for precise calculations
[12:35:46] <krambiorix> shoky, how can i do that then?
[12:35:49] <shoky> er
[12:35:55] <shoky> but..
[12:35:56] <andrewSC> hi all
[12:36:34] <shoky> krambiorix: .toFixed returns a string
[12:36:43] <shoky> krambiorix: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/a788H/1/
[12:36:59] <JakePee> Does anyone know of a good library to provide a UI for working with a json object
[12:36:59] <andrewSC> is there a way to see what script/line of code handled a click event in a browser? So I would basically look at my chrome dev tool and when I click on an element I can see what function/script handled the event?
[12:37:26] <krambiorix> shoky, which function do i need then?
[12:37:45] <JakePee> Preferably one that takes a base expansion level and has click-to-expand on remaining fields
[12:40:44] <shoky> krambiorix: multiply by 100, use Math.round to get an integer, do your comparison
[12:41:14] <shoky> or find a good bignumber library
[12:41:23] <krambiorix> shoky, not parseFloat?
[12:41:33] <shoky> no
[12:42:11] <shoky> can't do accurate floating point math

[12:48:43] <grafi> oô
[12:48:51] <grafi> yuck
[12:49:59] <Guest53835> why isnt the attachment-content div shown in this simple example? http://jsfiddle.net/RJ6QK/
[12:51:01] <shoky> Guest53835: shouldn't have the dot in the toggleClass call
[12:51:49] <Guest53835> there is a dot.  $('.attachment-content').toggleClass('.attachment-content-show')
[12:52:02] <duch_kazatel> right - toggleClass('.attachment-content-show') should be toggleClass('attachment-content-show')
[12:52:03] <shoky> remove that last dot
[12:52:04] <Guest53835> which dot?
[12:52:13] <shoky> you're toggling the attachment-content-show class
[12:52:16] <Guest53835> am. really?
[12:52:17] <Guest53835> ok
[12:52:18] <duch_kazatel> yes
[12:52:37] <Guest53835> thx!
[12:55:24] <JakePee> shoky: Perfect, exactly what I'm looking for
[12:57:08] <sunbeam> shoky: you mean for each <li> 25% ?
[12:57:20] <sunbeam> shoky: but the problem then is the list is not alphabetically
[12:58:05] <Guest53835> shoky,  in the said example, I have many attachment divs. it works ok but when one is click, all other attachment-content divs are shown up. how can i make this effect applied only to the clicked div (despite all divs have same class) ?
[12:59:59] <duch_kazatel> $(this).toggleClass('yourclass')
[13:00:03] <duch_kazatel> something like that?
[13:00:06] <Guest53835> http://jsfiddle.net/RJ6QK/2/
[13:00:11] <Guest53835> hm
[13:00:35] <Guest53835> duch_kazatel,  nice approach but its not $this
[13:00:45] <Guest53835> its a subclass / div inside $this
[13:01:15] <AlbinoGeek> Got a bit of a problem, in jQuery2 and bootstrap, I've got an input-group-btn pre-pended to an input field ("button"), and an input-group-btn appended to the input field ("submit").
[13:01:34] <AlbinoGeek> When I press the "<enter>" key in the input field, the button is toggled, instead of pressing submit!
[13:02:08] <AlbinoGeek> And even if I hack up the enter key : $('input[name="msg"]').keydown(function(event){ ... });  The button is still toggled, THEN the keydown function is called.
[13:02:42] <Guest53835> duch_kazatel,  how to get to $this.subclass/div.toggle
[13:02:51] <duch_kazatel> Guest29280 because of the way you're targeting - try this $(this).find('.attachment-content')
[13:03:18] <duch_kazatel> err, Guest53835
[13:03:38] <Guest53835> duch_kazatel,  .find is my only sane option?
[13:03:58] <duch_kazatel> you could also do .children()
[13:04:00] <Guest53835> duch_kazatel,  .child is also
[13:04:03] <Guest53835> hm
[13:04:08] <duch_kazatel> because of the way you're targeting, yes.
[13:04:12] <Guest53835> .children().first() then
[13:04:13] <ravigehlot> I have got 1500 <tr></tr> DOM elements with 4 <td></td> inside of each <tr></tr>. We would like to grab all 4 <td></td> values for 1500 <tr>'s into 1 line comma delimited. Who has an easy way out?
[13:05:44] <Guest53835> duch_kazatel,  not working..http://jsfiddle.net/RJ6QK/3/
[13:05:47] <shoky> ravigehlot: answered your q before.. <shoky> ravimiles: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/jRa52/3/  <shoky> ravimiles: or if you want it all in one string  http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/jRa52/4/
[13:06:04] <ravigehlot> shoky: sorry for bothering you on private.
[13:06:12] <ravigehlot> shoky: I was disconnected.
[13:06:17] <ravigehlot> shoky: let me check
[13:06:20] <shoky> s'ok
[13:06:23] <duch_kazatel> Guest53381 that's not how you use $this.
[13:06:28] <duch_kazatel> $this isn't auto-bound for you.
[13:06:44] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/RJ6QK/4/
[13:07:45] <duch_kazatel> crap Guest53835 way too many guests in here :)
[13:07:52] <ravigehlot> shoky: that did it
[13:08:00] <duch_kazatel> anyway - if you want to use $this, you need to do var $this = $(this);
[13:08:24] <AlbinoGeek> Code: http://jsfiddle.net/UKfT7/335/  If you press "enter" in the field, it clicks the first button, whereas the freaking RFC states that it should target the first submit.
[13:08:57] <ravigehlot> shoky: I was trying to loop over every tr, then grab each nth-child(1), nth-child(2), nth-child(3) and append them together with commas. that didn't work. why?
[13:09:01] <Guest53835> duch_kazatel,  thanks.   but should the class be inside the children() instead of first() brace?
[13:09:18] <duch_kazatel> Guest53835 not sure what you mean.
[13:09:26] <shoky> ravigehlot: i'd need to see your code
[13:09:51] <shoky> duch_kazatel  you did .first(selector)  ;p
[13:09:53] <AlbinoGeek> Any ideas on this would be great, since it's really pissing me off.
[13:09:55] <zizz> Hey guys I have a <span> inside an <a> that animates outside the <a> tag via this jQuery code.. http://jsfiddle.net/4S2j6/, but as the <span> sits outside the <a>, a user can hover over that area (since it's only opacity:0) and the hover action will trigger, can I disable that? or use something other than opacity that animates well?
[13:10:01] <ravigehlot> shoky: alright, give me a few...gotta write irt
[13:10:14] <Guest53835> shouldnt it be $(this).children('.attachment-content').first().toggleClass('attachment-content-show');
[13:10:42] <Guest53835> instead of   $(this).children().first('.attachment-content').toggleClass('attachment-content-show');
[13:11:06] <robert0> that was weird.
[13:11:17] <shoky> Guest53835 yeah. you don't really need the .first() at all
[13:11:32] <robert0> yeah not sure why you had it.
[13:11:35] <shoky> unless you'll have more later, didn't follow the discussion
[13:11:47] <ravigehlot> shoky:http://jsfiddle.net/jRa52/5/
[13:11:51] <Guest53835> there may be many children
[13:12:19] <robert0> Guest53835 - all with that same class?
[13:12:32] <shoky> ravigehlot: you're looping over every tr, but inside the loop you're doing $('.jquery-tablesorter tr > td:nth-child(1)')  which queries the whole table over again
[13:12:46] <shoky> ravigehlot: you need to be looking at the current row, i.e. "this" or $(this)
[13:12:56] <ravigehlot> shoky: right....
[13:13:02] <ravigehlot> shoky: gotcha
[13:13:07] <ravigehlot> shoky: I see why it didn't work
[13:13:08] <AlbinoGeek> You can view the issue live here: http://96.48.102.146/fuel/message (login as: demoUser / demoUser)  If you try and submit a message (type something, then press enter); the bold button is toggled before the form is submit, the bold button shouldn't be toggled at all.
[13:13:14] <ravigehlot> shoky: I also see why your way works.
[13:13:18] <ravigehlot> shoky: k. cool. thanks
[13:13:38] <zizz> Anyway to run these events simultaneously? .fadeIn(250).animate({ "left": "-215", },250)
[13:13:40] <zizz> instead of it fading in and then moving?
[13:13:59] <ravigehlot> shoky: maybe if I re-wrote it to use children().first() it would have worked...something like $(this).children().first() what do you think?
[13:14:17] <shoky> zizz sure, check out the "queue" option on those methods
[13:14:24] <Guest53835> thanks shoky  duch_kazatel
[13:14:50] <shoky> zizz for example you can do  .fadeIn({duration: 250, queue: false})
[13:16:09] <shoky> ravigehlot: sure that'd work.  but notice you're looping over the td's not the tr's
[13:16:54] <sunbeam> shoky: you mean for each <li> 25% ?
[13:16:56] <sunbeam> shoky: but the problem then is the list is not alphabetically
[13:17:16] <shoky> sunbeam: as usual i have no idea what you want
[13:17:21] <SuperPhly> Using jQuery 1.4.2 on a legacy app. I need to perform an action when the contents of a span are changed. I don't have access to .on('change') since this is 1.4.2. What's the "old way" of doing that?
[13:17:46] <AlbinoGeek> Right, I guess I'll just wait for the channel to slow down; not sure if anyone even saw my question at this rate, haha.
[13:17:51] <BillCriswell> SuperPhly: .change()
[13:18:01] <BillCriswell> SuperPhly: Or maybe .bind('change')
[13:18:09] <BillCriswell> Whichever.
[13:18:55] <ravigehlot> shoky: You have been very helpful. thanks for helping out this weekend as well (not sure if your remember me from this weekend)
[13:19:18] <shoky> ravigehlot: np ;]
[13:19:31] <ravigehlot> shoky: cool. ttyl
[13:20:59] <shoky> AlbinoGeek:  FWIW i can't really see the issue, but from your description it sounds like maybe you want to add type="button" to your non-submit <button>s
[13:21:15] <sunbeam> shoky: i have a list of brands
[13:21:30] <sunbeam> 32 brands
[13:21:36] <shoky> sunbeam: how is this relevant to anything
[13:21:38] <sunbeam> 4 * 8 brands next to each other
[13:21:38] <shoky> jeez
[13:21:45] <sunbeam> that's it
[13:21:46] <shoky> make a jsfiddle showing your problem
[13:21:56] <sunbeam> and giving each <li> 25% is semantically not correct I t hink
[13:21:58] <shoky> and what you've tried to far that isn't working
[13:22:08] <shoky> not going to answer your vague general questions
[13:22:11] <sunbeam> it works, i just say its semantically not correct
[13:22:13] <sunbeam> but ill show
[13:22:14] <sunbeam> 1 min
[13:22:26] <BillCriswell> Say whaaaaaaaatttt
[13:24:09] <AlbinoGeek> shoky: My non-submit buttons are <button> not <input>
[13:24:23] <AlbinoGeek> shoky: And yet, pressing <enter> inside an input field, toggles the first <button>
[13:24:35] <AlbinoGeek> EVEN IF jQuery has a event.preventDefault() for onkeyup AND onkeydown
[13:24:38] <AlbinoGeek> It STILL toggles
[13:24:45] <ravigehlot> shoky: one more question....I just want the text that is inside of <a> tags. http://jsfiddle.net/jRa52/5/
[13:25:04] <shoky> AlbinoGeek:  i know they are <button> and not <input>. i still stand by my suggestion
[13:25:23] <AlbinoGeek> shoky: I tried making them <input type="button"> and it still would toggle the first :(.
[13:25:24] <ravigehlot> shoky: in another words, there are link tags inside of td cells
[13:25:40] <AlbinoGeek> It would press the first button, INSTEAD OF submitting the form, unless I hacked submitting in.
[13:26:06] <ravigehlot> shoky: got it
[13:26:15] <ravigehlot> shoky: I added another children('a')
[13:26:16] <shoky> AlbinoGeek: welp it's submitting the form for me
[13:26:29] <ravigehlot> shoky: I added another children('td').children('a')
[13:26:37] <shoky> ravigehlot: ok dude ;]
[13:26:40] <AlbinoGeek> shoky: Yeah, only because I added the hack-in onkeyup event.
[13:26:44] <ravigehlot> shoky: cool
[13:26:45] <AlbinoGeek> shoky: Without that event, it won't even submit.
[13:26:54] <shoky> AlbinoGeek: can you remove it
[13:27:00] <shoky> AlbinoGeek: so .. we can actually see your issue
[13:27:09] <AlbinoGeek> shoky: Sure, removing now.
[13:27:26] <AlbinoGeek> shoky: Hard refresh
[13:27:44] <AlbinoGeek> shoky: If you type a message, then press enter; the bold is toggled, and nothing else.
[13:28:37] <shoky> AlbinoGeek:  ok, add type="button" to your <button> :)
[13:28:41] <shoky> <button>s
[13:28:54] <shoky> <button type="button ...
[13:29:02] <Ziberius> hello
[13:29:05] <shoky> er and close that quote
[13:29:10] <lintguy1> lHello
[13:29:19] <lintguy1> I have a problem.
[13:29:34] <AlbinoGeek> shoky: :/.  Welp, that worked; no idea why <input type="button"> doesn't.
[13:29:37] <Ziberius> I have a problem with the datatable plugin
[13:29:41] <AlbinoGeek> At least <button type="button" works.  Thanks.
[13:29:43] <Ziberius> I need to clone a table
[13:29:55] <Ziberius> but I can't find anything in the API to do that

[13:30:04] <sunbeam> shoky: http://jsfiddle.net/Be3q2/
[13:30:57] <sunbeam> shoky: http://jsfiddle.net/Be3q2/1/
[13:31:00] <sunbeam> check update sorry
[13:31:34] <AlbinoGeek> shoky: Thanks, at least it's working now :).
[13:31:50] <shoky> np
[13:31:58] <shoky> sunbeam k
[13:32:00] <sunbeam> shoky: that should be 1 list
[13:32:05] <sunbeam> shoky: and not 4 <ul>
[13:32:22] <SuperPhly> any reason a setTimeout would be executing immediately instead of delayed?
[13:33:11] <NoiseEee> SuperPhly: you've included ()
[13:33:22] <shoky> sunbeam ok there are probably fancy modern css3 ways to do what you want. maybe even not so fancy i dunno.. i dont care too much for semantics
[13:33:30] <shoky> sunbeam: #css
[13:34:02] <sunbeam> shoky: ahh so if you were me how would you code it? one list and float: left; width: 25% for each <li> ?
[13:34:10] <sunbeam> or the way I did it in teh fiddle
[13:35:17] <shoky> something like how you did it, i guess.. or i'd try to figure out other ways by reading around ;p
[13:36:32] <SuperPhly> NoiseEee: yep, had to wrap it in a lamda function
[13:36:42] <sunbeam> shoky: i did but there is no way using css3
[13:37:35] <grafi> [22:36:41] <sunbeam> shoky: i did but there is no way using css3
[13:37:36] <grafi> oO
[13:37:48] <grafi> for columns?
[13:38:04] <grafi> or for the exact number of elements per column?
[13:38:33] <sunbeam> grafi: number of <li>'s
[13:38:36] <sunbeam> grafi: did you read my question
[13:38:51] <grafi> http://csswizardry.com/demos/multiple-column-lists/
[13:39:00] <grafi> something like this doesnt get you there?
[13:39:20] <sunbeam> sec
[13:39:52] <shoky> grafi that splits in the wrong direction tho
[13:40:06] <shoky> well not splits
[13:40:15] <shoky> anyway its not top-down
[13:40:15] <sunbeam> yes, the issue is grafi that i cannot put an alphabetical list
[13:40:17] <sunbeam> like that
[13:40:19] <sunbeam> shoky: right
[13:40:34] <grafi> maybe i should read up on what you really wanted :P
[13:40:52] <shoky> sunbeam there's also a way with giving each <li> a class like "column1" "column2"  which might suit your needs..
[13:41:30] <sunbeam> shoky: how would that work ?
[13:41:35] <shoky> mmm giving different margin-left  for each column, for example
[13:42:02] <shoky> http://alistapart.com/article/multicolumnlists
[13:42:10] <shoky> thats the 4th example
[13:43:51] <Eviltwin> Glad to see that my jsFiddles still circulate in here.
[13:44:55] <shoky> ;D
[13:48:18] <sunbeam> shoky: thanks!
[13:48:26] <sunbeam> shoky: however I think I indeed shouldn't care about this

[15:17:59] <Lispet> i have made a toggle button that shows or hides a div. but i am unable to change the text on the button. I want it to be "Show" when the div is not shown and "Hide" when the div is shown. How do i do this?
[15:33:22] <xDarkice> What would be the best way to select all elements where all children have the same class (I thought of something like myElem.children().length == myElem.children("the-class-every-child-must-have").length)
[15:33:46] <xDarkice> but I don't know how to put that condition into a selector
[15:34:07] <mathi> hi
[15:34:16] <aAres> Why not select them by that class?
[15:34:23] <aAres> Does their parent have an ID or class?
[15:35:35] <aAres> d
[15:35:35] <mathi> if I have two input fields, one loses focus and the other gets focus, is it guaranteed that blur() event (of the element that lost focus) happens BEFORE the focus() event (new element got focus) ?
[15:38:48] <xDarkice> aAres, yes the parent also has a class
[15:39:25] <xDarkice> I want all parents where all childs of that parent do have a specific class
[15:39:58] <aAres> xDarkice: So you may not even have to worry about their parents, depending on your implementation
[15:40:14] <aAres> Could be:
[15:40:22] <xDarkice> well my parents have a specific class as well
[15:40:39] <aAres> $('#parent_div div.row').addClass('purple');
[15:40:51] <aAres> Ah ha, and now I see your challenge
[15:41:03] <xDarkice> yeah :/
[15:41:14] <aAres> So you could replace #parent_div with the parents' common class
[15:41:30] <aAres> $('div.table div.row')
[15:41:31] <xDarkice> basically select all .parent where all childs do have .child
[15:42:05] <aAres> Ok, that's probably going to be an each iteration
[15:42:32] <aAres> I think you're going to have to loop through each parent to see if their children have children (right?)
[15:43:03] <xDarkice> well, I thought of checking if parent.children().length is the same as parent.children('.child').length
[15:43:41] <xDarkice> but I am not sure how to put that into a selector
[15:50:53] <mathi> ho can i check that at least one input element has the focus, in a specific div
[15:51:04] <mathi> ?
[15:51:17] <Blaster> hey how can I make this do the same effect over and over? http://jsfiddle.net/bS4H7/4/
[15:55:10] <shoky> Blaster: by doing it over and over ;p http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/bS4H7/5/
[15:55:48] <Blaster> you're a rockstar why is it so hard for me to wrap my head around this?
[15:58:03] <shoky> thinking too hard
[16:00:18] <Blaster> shoky:  how do I add acceleration? http://jsfiddle.net/bS4H7/7/
[16:00:40] <shoky> meaning?
[16:01:03] <Blaster> i ^ x  I think
[16:01:16] <Blaster> I want it to move faster as it progresses the blinking to the right
[16:01:54] <shoky> so as i gets bigger you want the timeout to be smaller
[16:02:10] <shoky> what is x ;p
[16:02:11] <Blaster> yeah you're right :P
[16:02:22] <Blaster> 523 in my last example
[16:02:30] <Blaster> the time between sequential blinks
[16:02:37] <Blaster> so yeah it should get smaller as i increases
[16:02:54] <shoky> ok let's improve how you're doing the blinks
[16:03:19] <Blaster> sure how would you improve it?
[16:08:03] <shoky> using setTimeout for the in-between delay only,
[16:08:18] <shoky> something like this  http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/bS4H7/8/
[16:09:23] <murph> Is there a best way to simulate clicking a 'submit' button on a form? I want it to catch any handlers that may be registered and such.

[16:54:50] <duch_kazatel> on a click on a tr?
[16:54:55] <RonWhoCares> Yes
[16:54:58] <duch_kazatel> yes.
[16:55:13] <duch_kazatel> $('tr').on('click', function(){});
[16:55:54] <duch_kazatel> $('tr').on('click', function(){$(this).attr('id');});
[16:55:59] <duch_kazatel> that should get you what you need.

[17:03:28] <MikeChel1n> when using getjson to query with jsonp like this http://pastebin.com/MrNjY0v3 what do you do if the field name "name" includes a space like "first name"?
[17:04:23] <MikeChel1n> result.response.docs[0]."first name" does not seem like the right answer
[17:05:18] <dfletcher> MikeChel1n, it's result.response.docs[0]['name with space'] you can access object members with dictionary/array-like accessors. but this is basic javascript not really jquery ,)
[17:06:44] <MikeChel1n> dfletcher: ah ok thank you
[17:07:01] <duch_kazatel> MikeChel1n javascript has object property access notation, which lets you use characters that you can't use with dot notation.
[17:07:24] <duch_kazatel> anything inside the square brackets gets evaluated.  it's good times.
[17:07:56] <dfletcher> yeah you can do some neat things. $('.something)[condition ? 'show' : 'hide']('slow');
[17:08:06] <duch_kazatel> yup

[23:52:42] <joroci> woks like tis
[23:52:43] <joroci> his
[23:52:53] <dwarder> tits?
[23:52:57] <dwarder> ;)
[23:53:04] <joroci> tits always work
[23:53:38] <joroci> you need a value that actually evaluate to false
[23:53:46] <joroci> but myName had no referecne
[23:53:50] <dwarder> i see
[23:53:54] <dwarder> thanx
[23:54:15] <Cork> something like window['myName'] || '' would work too
[23:54:27] <Cork> or window.myName
[23:54:32] <Cork> or any object reference
[23:54:39] <Cork> as they don't cause name error
[23:54:43] <Cork> (if missing)
[23:57:42] <dwarder> Cork: thanks
