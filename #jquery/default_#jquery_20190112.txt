[06:22:39] <paule32> hello
[06:22:52] <paule32> how can i write an array in array
[06:23:17] <paule32> e.g: arrayA = ["A1","B1","C1"];
[06:23:44] <paule32> arrayB = ["AA1","AA2"];
[06:24:53] <paule32> is the right form:
[06:25:38] <paule32> var arrayVar = [ ["A1" ["AA1","AA2"]] , ... ];
[06:25:39] <paule32> ?
[06:47:47] <paule32> so here are the sructure of the array:

[06:48:16] <paule32> how can i for loop  "Standard", "Additional", ... ?
[07:30:32] <devi8> paule32, I think you need to be in #javascript. This isn't a jquery issue.
[07:31:16] <paule32> yeah
[07:31:33] <paule32> devi8: have you an idea?
[07:32:21] <devi8> use an object
[07:33:11] <devi8> var tabs={standardard:[ add images], additional:[more stuff]};
[07:33:55] <devi8> then for (var p in obj) { imageslist=obj[p]; do stuff with imageslist}
[07:42:36] <devi8> https://jsfiddle.net/neverDevi8/1rfzh0gt/6/
[07:46:23] <paule32> devi8: http://dpaste.com/06WJK0D
[07:46:30] <paule32> i get undefined
[07:54:54] <devi8> i don't think you understand the very basics of js.
[07:56:03] <devi8> an object consists of key/value pairs. there will always be a key:value thing happening* whereas an array is just a list of items item1, item2, item3.
[07:56:21] <devi8> but it gets confusing because some arrays are called associative arrays and look just like objects
[07:58:13] <devi8> so group your things that need to be together into an object. Like images and hints. It's better to have two objects [{images:url, hints:txt},{images:url, hints:txt}] than listing them sequentially

[14:27:21] <Tcalp> I"m having an odd issue with .append() where my data isn't being appended, there are no errors being generated.  code JS code : https://puu.sh/CvEEa/0a33c42de5.png , the debug alerts both have data populated, but the table row isn't being created/appended.
[14:29:08] <Tcalp> nevermind
[14:31:09] <c03> hi
[14:31:15] <c03> Does anyone have experience with Handsontable?
[14:31:58] <c03> I have a modal that I would like to keep focus, so it can be closed with enter. But HOT steals focus after I assign it to the modal.
[14:56:45] <Azrael_-> hi
[14:57:18] <Azrael_-> i am adding a new table row using "lastrow.after(newRow);" but when i do this the page jumps to the top. how can i avoid the scrolling?
[14:58:23] <Guest58> Azrael_- try use callback fonctuon scroll.offset.top;
[14:58:29] <Guest58> function*
[14:58:49] <Azrael_-> Guest58: mind explaining it a little bit more? can't really follow you
[14:59:28] <Guest58> you want to scroll or that a bug?
[15:00:12] <Azrael_-> i have no clue why the page scrolls to the top in the browser if i add a row. i don't want this to happen. don't know what you mean with "bug"
[15:01:11] <Guest58> scroll to top? row with grid?
[15:01:14] <Guest58> js?
[15:02:16] <Azrael_-> if you would write your questions with more than just a few key words, then i could perhaps understand and answer them
[15:02:36] <Guest58> from what you got scroll top?
[15:02:43] <Guest58> by css or js?
[15:03:59] <Azrael_-> no clue how this could happen using css. i am only adding a new table row using javascript. then the vertical scrollbar i always scrolling to the top without stating this anywhere in js
[15:04:33] <Azrael_-> so i assume i either do this wrong in js (adding the row) or there is some standard functionality i have to override
[15:05:13] <Guest58> jsfiddle?
[15:05:24] <Azrael_-> just setting up one
[15:06:36] <Guest58> good
[15:06:50] <Guest58> and what you want insert in that row?
[15:06:52] <Guest58> text?
[15:06:55] <Guest58> data?
[15:16:46] <Azrael_-> https://jsfiddle.net/4ebLjt2x/
[15:16:51] <Azrael_-> just some text
[15:17:31] <Azrael_-> i'm not good with frontend stuff, that's why i'm really struggeling with this damn stuff :)
[15:21:41] <Guest58> Azrael_- https://jsfiddle.net/2nkbsz8r/1/
[15:22:27] <Azrael_-> arg, ok, just the preventDefault :) thanks a lot!

[17:41:04] <UberStrik88> Hey guys I am new to learning how to use Jquery. I want to make a html table using data that I get from an JSON reponse but I can't seem to make it work. Here is the function that I used but I only get an error in the chrome console. Anyone can help me? https://pastebin.com/grtPGq3f
[17:56:16] <pavonia> What error? A full example fiddle would be more helpful
[22:26:18] <Guddu> Can file data be posted using AJAX?
