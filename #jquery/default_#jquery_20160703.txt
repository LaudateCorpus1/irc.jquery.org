[00:08:42] <aro> will trigger('click') invoke bindings on $(document.body).on('click', ....
[00:10:51] <arc_> As of jQuery 1.3, .trigger()ed events bubble up the DOM tree; an event handler can stop the bubbling by returning false from the handler or calling the .stopPropagation() method on the event object passed into the event. Although .trigger() simulates an event activation, complete with a synthesized event object, it does not perfectly replicate a naturally-occurring event.
[00:10:51] <arc_> To trigger handlers bound via jQuery without also triggering the native event, use .triggerHandler() instead.
[00:10:54] <arc_> http://api.jquery.com/trigger/
[00:32:31] <aro> how do i trigger an event that invokes bound handlers?
[00:33:08] <aro> nvm
[00:37:13] <aro> i cant get triggerhandler to work
[00:37:23] <aro> i have a binding using $(document.body).on()
[00:37:33] <aro> i cant get that event to execute when calling it with $.trigger()
[00:44:46] <arc_> may i ask why you are using $(document.body) instead of $('body')
[00:47:51] <arc_> https://jsfiddle.net/1az90b2p/
[00:48:00] <arc_> seems to work either way
[00:50:16] <arc_> all the way back to jquery 1.1.3, the oldest version i can select on jsfiddle
[03:03:55] <warden23> Does anyone see why this is not working? http://jsfiddle.net/n7VMY/15/
[03:04:35] <warden23> I'm trying to get it so if .test has the same as .num which is 30 then .red is added and the text is red..
[03:07:07] <warden23> So the .num will be red btw :)
[03:11:50] <warden23> Please anyone?
[04:20:26] <warden23> Does anyone know how to convert this into jquery? http://jsfiddle.net/n7VMY/17/ thanks :)
[04:23:58] <systemfault> What's not jQuery in that code?
[04:37:30] <warden23> systemfault: sorry I mean to shortin it :)

[06:56:53] <topohomy> How should I save the tags I enter with PHP?
[06:57:09] <topohomy> I mean it is not like the form to grab the variables. How am I supposed to save such tags?
[06:57:23] <topohomy> In the tagging section, you just have to scroll down a bit.
[07:04:55] <topohomy> Isn't there anybody to help?
[07:05:02] <topohomy> At least give me a hint.
[08:29:36] <Chulbul> how and what to send via server side language in order to catch error inside error: function() { } of ajax method.
[08:32:23] <shoky> an error status code, e.g. 500
[10:51:27] <fission6> how do i ignore a select with a certain class in my query, i have $('select') but i want to ignore select.ignore

[11:54:15] <ZoderUck> hello
[11:55:12] <ZoderUck> i sit in an javascript interactive window,   h is of object [date] Sat Oct 01 2016 00:00:00 GMT+0200 (W. Europe Daylight Time)[date] Sat Oct 01 2016 00:00:00 GMT+0200 (W. Europe Daylight Time)         if i do h.getMonth()  i get 9 instead of monthnr 10
[11:57:48] <shoky> ZoderUck: that's how it's supposed to behave. the month is 0-based
[11:58:05] <shoky> i.e.  0 is jan
[11:58:31] <salemjs> Hey guys! I'm building chrome extension. There is a webpage with list. My ext sorts this list the way I want. It's working on initial page load. The problem is this list is dynamic. It updates itself based on searchbar input (remote AJAX calls). I can't make my code fire after all the updating happened. .on('change') doesn't help. I need guidance.
[12:14:04] <salemjs> Anyone? I would solve this myself, but this is chrome extension, I can't modify original JS.
[12:14:48] <salemjs> I need a way to detect when original JS finished rebuilding content of the list.
[12:24:41] <salemjs> Ok. Solved this problem with DOM Mutation Observer (holy shit) https://github.com/kapetan/jquery-observe
[12:30:10] <stemid> https://paste.fedoraproject.org/387628/75633351/ I'm sure I'm missing something simple, I'm requesting JSON from a local url using jquery.ajax, but I've tried .get and getJSON too, I've tried dataType "json" and "text", I get an error in firefox saying JSON.parse "unexpected end of data at line 1 column 1"
[12:30:16] <stemid> anyone know what I'm missing?
[12:30:21] <stemid> jsonlint says the json is valid
[12:31:39] <stemid> and I'm doing the request from a local file open in firefox, with security.fileuri.strict_origin_policy set to false.
[12:31:43] <stemid> so I assume I don't need CORS
[12:43:50] <JohnTortellini> hello, is it possible to get the class from an element that was just selected by its ID
[13:10:15] <shoky> stemid: you get a JSON.parse error when you have dataType "text" ..?  also, not sure that firefox setting does anything with CORS..
[13:11:10] <shoky> anyways you should see what happens when loading it from a webserver, and in chrome
[13:40:44] <stemid> shoky: I guess you were right, I moved the html code into the wsgi app that handles the json output. as a template. and then the JS worked.
[13:40:58] <stemid> so it must be something about making the ajax request from a local file uri to a localhost url.
[13:59:07] <likego> hi
[14:00:39] <notchris_> does .find work on data returned from an ajax request
[14:01:32] <sillyslux> idts, have you tried?
[14:02:33] <sillyslux> and what kind of data do you get via ajax?
[14:02:42] <notchris_> Hmm it did not work
[14:02:53] <notchris_> The html of another page
[14:14:17] <paulvd> is imagesLoaded included in isotope v 2.1.1 ?
[14:22:55] <notchris_> Iâ€™m having trouble searching through returned html data
[14:22:57] <notchris_> http://pastie.org/private/ldmwzmfkfybfmg177zcma
[14:45:23] <shoky> notchris_: DOMElements don't have a .filter method, only jquery objects do.  $('<div>').append(data).find('script')  could work
[14:45:40] <notchris_> TY shoky
[14:45:43] <notchris_> I figured it out!
[14:46:20] <notchris_> shoky: http://pastie.org/private/cqswe2evyy9hf0tl77avq
[14:46:47] <shoky> no need to use the native DOM api if you're already using jquery
[14:47:15] <notchris_> true
[18:02:31] <chrisTech2> http://pastebin.com/NyS7AAmk Only first settimeout works. What am I doing wrong?
[18:10:05] <Ales> chrisTech2 i think you have to use delay between setTimeouts, because both happen in same time therefore you won't see second.. am i right sillyslux
[18:13:14] <chrisTech2> Ales, isn't setTimeout the delay?
[18:13:16] <sillyslux> um well, i see 8 timeouts
[18:13:25] <sillyslux> all of them are fireing
[18:13:49] <sillyslux> everything at once
[18:13:49] <chrisTech2> sillyslux, that is what I'm trying to do, just not fire at the same time.
[18:14:09] <sillyslux> but what?
[18:14:12] <chrisTech2> How is it doing that when I set timeout for 3 sec?
[18:14:31] <sillyslux> you do that 8 times
[18:14:44] <sillyslux> 8 timeouts with 3seconds
[18:14:46] <Ales> chrisTech2, they are timeouts..but u do them same line basically
[18:15:11] <sillyslux> what are trying to do?
[18:15:43] <chrisTech2> I'm trying to toggle fade an image with 3 secs interval.
[18:15:47] <Ales> he wants to display first fadein then wait 3 sec then display another 1 basically
[18:15:50] <Ales> in a loop
[18:16:14] <sillyslux> well in that case i'd do that with css
[18:16:15] <chrisTech2> correct
[18:17:03] <chrisTech2> Not sure how to do that.
[18:17:09] <Ales> chrisTech2 can you add .delay( 1000 ) at your first function
[18:17:25] <sillyslux> if you want js, do the setTimeout for fade back in in the callback for fade out
[18:17:37] <Ales> and since it's a loop at .delay( 1000 ) on second one too
[18:17:42] <sillyslux> or even better, what ales says
[18:18:15] <sillyslux> or use $.animate
[18:18:32] <sillyslux> somebody already did that 2 days ago
[18:19:27] <sillyslux> no, can't find the link
[18:19:42] <sillyslux> was in a fiddle
[18:20:02] <Ales> chrisTech2, https://jsfiddle.net/mbL5od9w/1/
[18:21:24] <sillyslux> that's good, does it 4 times
[18:21:55] <Ales> yu
[18:24:38] <sillyslux> or you do it like this https://jsfiddle.net/mbL5od9w/3/
[18:25:18] <sillyslux> anyways, css covers it all
[18:29:23] <chrisTech2> Ales, sillyslux, thank you
[18:29:43] <Ales> yw chrisTech2
[18:51:21] <mechanist> hello friends
[18:51:21] <mechanist> why these scripts not work? http://pastebin.com/Z1FdKhPv
[18:55:12] <shoky> jquery not included?
[18:55:39] <shoky> also you should preventDefault on the form's submit event, not the button's click event
[18:56:00] <shoky> well, assuming you want to prevent the form submit
[18:56:32] <mechanist> sorry
[18:56:45] <mechanist> this is the most recent one, always  not working: http://pastebin.com/RkK4zzYy
[18:56:47] <Ales> i put this on jsfiddle sillyslux i'm trying to console error idk whats wrong https://jsfiddle.net/dcr90hye/
[18:56:55] <Ales> its from mechanist ^
[18:57:14] <shoky> mechanist: make a jsfiddle. and give more information. "not working" is useless
[18:57:52] <Ales> shoky https://jsfiddle.net/dcr90hye/ thats his jsfiddle
[18:58:37] <shoky> there shouldnt be  html tags in the javascript pane
[18:59:33] <shoky> e.g. <script>
[18:59:53] <sillyslux> ales there's also a tidy button in the fiddles nav-bar
[19:00:05] <sillyslux> and no body tag in html panne
[19:00:30] <Ales> i typed 3 in username and print textfield.val(); and i'm getting undefined
[19:00:38] <mechanist> shoky: I mean that I can't see any graphic style, I just see the html box, while I should see this http://bootsnipp.com/snippets/featured/show-password
[19:01:37] <sillyslux> https://jsfiddle.net/dcr90hye/1/
[19:01:39] <Ales> u didnt give css mechanist..
[19:01:40] <shoky> graphic style should come from css, donno what you mean
[19:01:45] <sillyslux> now where's the problem?
[19:02:03] <Ales> https://jsfiddle.net/dcr90hye/2/ fixed for you......

[19:04:45] <Ales> maybe quotes
[19:05:06] <sillyslux> where's that `a` coming from?
[19:05:20] <shoky> the tidy button killed the js in line 2
[19:05:29] <shoky> put a newline inside a string literal
[19:06:01] <shoky> what `a`?
[19:06:22] <sillyslux> oh indeed
[19:06:40] <sillyslux> in the result above the button
[19:07:07] <shoky> appears as a blank box to me
[19:07:30] <shoky> its from the css   content: "\e105";
