[00:41:34] <norbi> hi guys, im having a hard time sending over a multidimensional array over $.ajax POST, with console.log(jQuery.type(multidarray)); console.log(multidarray); i get an output of: ¨array [+[],[]]¨ in firebug and if i stringify it it will become [[],[]] ... i know i miss something but i cant figure out what
[00:42:06] <norbi> it just looks like an empty array when i pass it to $.ajax
[00:42:13] <norbi> or any other function
[00:42:57] <norbi> multidarray.join(¨¨) gives an empty string, even if i have 2 arrays in it with not empty values
[00:43:51] <fabioportieri> norbi: can't you use serializeArray?
[00:45:43] <norbi> fabioportieri: do u mean multidarray.serializeArray
[00:45:46] <norbi> ?
[00:46:30] <fabioportieri> no i meant something like this http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11376184/jquery-serializearray-key-value-pairs
[00:49:52] <norbi> fabioportieri: well i don´t understand how could i use that on a simple array
[00:50:30] <fabioportieri> norbi: if you don't build the array from a form i don't think you can use it indeed...
[00:51:33] <norbi> fabioportieri: well ive sent simple array over [¨one¨,¨two¨] etc worked fine, but multid array wont..
[00:53:35] <fabioportieri> try to paste a usecase so people can help you better
[00:53:42] <fabioportieri> a jsfiddle
[00:56:28] <BrazenBraden> https://gist.github.com/brazenbraden/12b1173b1d93b2adc72d  <- you see the first array in the errors object is called 'name'? How can I get that out in jquery? There could be multiple arrays there.. (name: Array, date: Array, age: Array  etc)
[00:56:58] <BrazenBraden> .errors[0] ?
[00:58:30] <BrazenBraden> nope
[00:58:47] <norbi> fabioportieri: i will make now some sort of showcase of my problem
[00:58:50] <fabioportieri> BrazenBraden: errors seems to be an object there, not an array
[00:59:21] <BrazenBraden> fabioportieri: I know.. not sure how to go about accessing each of the arrays dynamically.. a for each loop?
[00:59:47] <fabioportieri> yes
[01:00:47] <BrazenBraden> ahh :)
[01:06:16] <NBhosting> how do i reverse this https://dpaste.de/1EsD
[01:07:16] <tables> how do i cut up a variable into 500 byte segments?
[01:07:31] <tables> var blah = '2000characters';
[01:07:53] <tables> i wanna cut that to blah1= '500characters';   blah2= 'next500characters';    and so on
[01:09:30] <Fusl> tables: 'your2000characterstringhere'.match(/.{1,500}/g)
[01:09:52] <Fusl> it returns an array of 500 character chunks
[01:10:26] <tables> i'm  new to jquery, how do i use a var twothousand instead of 'your2000characterstringhere' string?
[01:10:52] <Uhkis> this really isn't jquery specific question
[01:11:18] <Fusl> tables: yourvarhere.match(/.{1,500}/g)
[01:11:34] <tables> and what would the new variables be called?
[01:11:51] <tables> basically my problem is i'm sending a 5000character request to server
[01:11:53] <tables> but it won't work
[01:11:54] <Fusl> the new variables are an array'd return of match
[01:11:57] <tables> i need 500char chunks
[01:12:05] <tables> i see
[01:12:22] <Fusl> so, var yourchunks = yourstring.match(/.{1,500}/g);
[01:13:04] <tables> what would my new variables look like?
[01:13:07] <tables> i don't get how match works
[01:13:25] <Fusl> Uhkis: we all know that javascript guys are always asking here because we jquery guys know what we're doing in javascript :P
[01:14:03] <Uhkis> Fusl: no necessarily, jquery makes stuff too easy ;)
[01:15:02] <Fusl> tables: yourchunks is now an array... you can loop through it or get only a specific key: yourchunks.forEach(function (yourchunk) { /* do something with yourchunk here */ }); or yourchunks[0] is the first entry, yourchunks[1] the second and so on
[01:16:38] <Fusl> tables: but, tbh... Uhkis is right, this isn't really a jquery specific question and if you want to learn javascript you should rather decide to ask in ##javascript
[02:02:57] <anli_> If I .hide() a div where there is a <script>, will .show() on that div load the js file again?
[02:09:16] <seutje> anli_: the parser does not care about visibility of script blocks
[02:09:36] <seutje> in fact, <head> is by default display: none;
[02:09:55] <anli_> The problem I have is that js files seems to be loaded many times
[02:10:13] <anli_> Once when I start and once when a div containing the script tag is shown
[02:11:25] <seutje> are you sure it is merely being shown? some frameworks tend to re-render entire regions
[02:11:55] <seutje> easy solution is to not have scripts in divs, I guess
[02:12:36] <anli_> It is a lot more flexible if I dont have to put those in <head>
[02:13:01] <seutje> you don't, in fact, it's usually better to have them at the bottom
[02:13:26] <anli_> But when I create a minimal example, it seems like the file is not run more than just onload
[02:13:51] <anli_> Well, at the bottom works, but the fact remains, its still a script in the dom
[02:13:59] <anli_> (inside body and probably inside a div)
[02:14:02] <seutje> yeah, there's probably more going on than just show/hide
[02:14:19] <anli_> Must check
[02:14:22] <seutje> anli_: sure, but the body is far less likely to pop in and out of existence
[02:14:27] <anli_> hehe
[02:15:03] <anli_> We create modules that has <script> tags, and given that a <script> may occur anywhere on a webpage
[02:15:50] <seutje> this forces you to put libraries at the top, no?
[02:16:22] <Misan> hello there
[02:16:22] <anli_> I will include the js files from the modules themselves, so nothing will be collected in <head>
[02:16:40] <seutje> anli_: so you inlcude jquery with every module?
[02:16:46] <seutje> include*
[02:16:47] <anli_> Not jquery
[02:16:59] <anli_> Its a different lib from the others :)
[02:17:03] <seutje> so where does that go? since parsing the DOM requires it?
[02:17:20] <anli_> jquery is always in use so its an exception
[02:18:49] <seutje> so how does that work with multiple of the same component?
[02:19:03] <seutje> do you recreate all the common functionality for each instance?
[02:19:19] <anli_> We usually only include one per component, for instance a slideshow will only be once in a page
[02:19:19] <seutje> or do you chuck it onto a global scope and just check if it's already there?
[02:19:31] <seutje> usually?
[02:19:33] <anli_> yeah
[02:19:37] <seutje> so it has to work with multiple?
[02:19:40] <anli_> no
[02:19:50] <seutje> so always
[02:19:55] <anli_> ah, yeah
[02:20:24] <Misan> is it possible that $.extend() will not merge methods of subobjects? even if I got true as first parameter (deep merge) ?
[02:24:07] <le_gars> Hi I have question about location.href.replace(location.hash,""). Im trying to implement a back link, similar to the one Github has, the "back to issue list". So I have a view with images. I would like to when I click a image to save its position and add anchor to the id of the item.
[02:26:03] <le_gars> So when I click a image and open it in another view I want to b clicking the back link easily get back to the saved position. Imagine that I have a view with a lot of images. So saving the position of where I was is a way of making it easier for people.
[02:26:29] <le_gars> Can I achieve this with location.href.replace(location.hash,"") ?
[02:26:55] <le_gars> I tried it out in the web inspector and it returns the current position(the url that is).
[02:50:53] <pingo> Is there a way to check if there are any handlers specified on an element for a certain event?
[02:51:34] <pingo> Like I have an element and I would like to check if any handlers are registered on it for a custom event "resizing"
[02:51:51] <Cork> pingo: natively; no
[02:51:54] <Cork> officially, no
[02:52:16] <Cork> possible in an unsupported way $._data(elm, 'events')
[02:52:52] <Cork> pingo: so basically you should not base it on that if you can avoide it
[02:55:38] <pingo> Cork ok, thanks for the info
[03:01:15] <Cork> lovely
[03:01:21] <Cork> even more time with windows xp...
[03:02:00] <pingo> only malware signatures though
[03:03:10] <Cork> pingo: ya, but that will be enough for ppl to not feel they have to switch
[03:03:29] <Cork> heck total end of update is barely enough
[03:04:33] <pingo> I doubt that people who still use XP even know what updates are :(
[03:05:07] <Cork> they do
[03:05:15] <Cork> sadly enough i know quite a few that use it
[03:10:32] <fattest>  how do i add description to my notification? http://jsfiddle.net/RNJ7P/3/ ?
[03:13:36] <seutje> http://jsfiddle.net/RNJ7P/4/ ?
[03:14:48] <fattest> seutje: thank you so much
[03:15:29] <fattest> seutje: would it be possible to write it under the line?
[03:17:16] <seutje> fattest: guess u'd have to work some CSS magic for that, or make the description like a fake button
[03:19:38] <fattest> ok thanks
[03:30:34] <Tomashe> Hey guys, im using mapquest api for my mapping , and i keep getting "This key is not authorized for this service. If you do not have a key, you can obtain a free key by registering at http://developer.mapquest.com."  im registered and using apikey
[03:39:41] <basiclaser> I'm talking any shop API that allows for maximum radius from location orders. It can be WP, joomla, whatever. my main requirement is the ordering distance limit
[03:51:43] <TigerParket> Hello everybody, hope everything is ok for you
[03:53:31] <TigerParket> I'm facing a problem, i've a website with big backgrounds and imgs, i want to set up a loader for both of them > load the page when all background images and img are downloaded
[03:53:36] <TigerParket> Any advice ? Thanks
[03:58:15] <TigerParket> anyone ?
[04:00:22] <Uhkis> TigerParket: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/476679/preloading-images-with-jquery
[04:07:25] <BrazenBraden> now, this works fine but as it stands, is there a better way to do this? https://gist.github.com/brazenbraden/4a7af66f1948c4dd6090
[04:09:01] <TigerParket> Uhkis: what this code do exactly ?
[04:09:57] <BrazenBraden> TigerParket: display errors on a form if validation fails (RoR site)
[04:10:46] <TigerParket> BrazenBraden: sounds good :) but was talking with Uhkis about my background images preloading problem :)
[04:10:58] <BrazenBraden> TigerParket: oh.. my bad :P
[04:23:30] <seutje> BrazenBraden: ur wrapping the element in $() twice
[04:23:40] <seutje> elem passed to the function is already jQueryfied
[04:23:51] <seutje> so u can just go elem.find(...)
[04:23:57] <seutje> instead of $(elem).find(...
[04:27:11] <amcsi_work> I have a recursive, collapsible menu, mostly closed (display: none) by default. As we all know, jquery doesn't know the height of an element until it is shown, so it wouldn't be possible to do a slide open animation on most menu elements without being opened before first. What's the typical thing to do for animation to work for all collapsible submenus?
[04:27:35] <BrazenBraden> seutje: line?
[04:27:42] <BrazenBraden> oh
[04:27:49] <BrazenBraden> seutje: thanks
[04:28:29] <seutje> amcsi_work: set display to either block or inline-block, measure dimension, set back to none
[04:28:49] <seutje> not that this triggers reflows, so beware when doing this in a loop over a ton of elements
[04:28:54] <seutje> s/not/note
[04:29:03] <`ULT> hi, $(document).ready(function(){}) is exactely the same as $(function(){})?
[04:29:21] <amcsi_work> seutje, is that what everyone does?
[04:29:49] <seutje> amcsi_work: some people add a position:absolute to minimize impact
[04:30:20] <seutje> amcsi_work: instead of setting back to none, u can just unset it (so there's no inline style and it falls back to what's in the regular css)
[04:30:51] <amcsi_work> I see, ok, thanks

[05:13:13] <basiclaser> Hi guys, are there any e-commerce plugins that allow me to limit sales to a 6km radius to a restaurant for example?
[05:13:17] <basiclaser> I'm talking any shop API that allows for maximum radius from location orders. It can be WP, joomla, whatever. my main requirement is the ordering distance limit
[05:15:01] <zulcc> distance calculation based on user-entered address values? or without user-data
[05:15:21] <PatBateman> hey, why could be that my form doesnt submit, only if I comment out the main js file. Btw. i dont use this form in the js ..
[05:32:32] <Tomashe> i get issue with parse $.parseJSON(data); altough the data is VALID and i tested it in validator
[05:32:36] <Tomashe> what could be the issue there
[05:32:44] <BrazenBraden> form.serializeArray() returns the name and value of elements in the form, however I would also like to get the ids, classes and whatever else applies to the form elements.. how can I do that?
[05:33:01] <BrazenBraden> Tomashe: what is the issue?
[05:33:15] <Tomashe> i dont know i just get errors
[05:33:21] <BrazenBraden> yea, what errors?
[05:33:24] <Tomashe> Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token o

[05:33:39] <BrazenBraden> gist
[05:33:59] <BrazenBraden> whats your code?
[05:34:20] <Tomashe> return window.JSON.parse( data );
[05:34:27] <Tomashe> in that line 550
[05:34:45] <Tomashe> my code is simple really var newdata = $.parseJSON(data);
[05:35:15] <BrazenBraden> and what does data look like?
[05:35:34] <Tomashe> json data
[05:35:47] <BrazenBraden> -.-
[05:36:27] <Tomashe> its more the 64kb so i can not paste it in pastie
[05:36:30] <Tomashe> let me try another
[05:36:58] <seutje> Tomashe: does the json lint?
[05:37:13] <seutje> oh my bad, just read up :d
[05:37:32] <Tomashe> http://pastebin.com/n8CngKXj
[05:37:57] <Tomashe> here is my json response
[05:38:44] <seutje> parses for me
[05:38:56] <seutje> ur not trying to parse a jsonp response as json, are u?
[05:39:02] <Tomashe> nop
[05:39:07] <Tomashe> i will show u my code
[05:40:00] <Tomashe> http://pastie.org/private/ynlfoktpzyydfhhhrdgw
[05:42:11] <seutje> weird, try logging the map_result and check if it is the string ur expecting
[05:42:16] <seutje> cause it does parse: http://jsfiddle.net/LcjPg/
[05:43:27] <Tomashe> hmm
[05:43:37] <Tomashe> when i console.log the map_result i get nothing in return
[05:43:43] <Tomashe> i wassure its because that error
[05:43:44] <Tomashe> s
[05:44:42] <Tomashe> maybe the ajax its self doesnt return the string?
[05:44:57] <Tomashe> but on my "network" window i see the post and the respons
[05:46:12] <Tomashe> tell me something my ajax call is inside another ajax call, is that even possible?
[05:47:32] <Tomashe> http://jsfiddle.net/S842n/ < this is how my entire thing looks like
[05:50:36] <seutje> why are you looping over the first results twice?
[05:50:49] <seutje> and on line 21, where does url come from?
[05:50:57] <Tomashe> i have the url outside
[05:51:03] <Tomashe> the url is ok
[05:51:03] <seutje> also, that loop doesn't use the json it's looping over
[05:51:13] <Tomashe> ?
[05:51:16] <Tomashe> what u mean by that
[05:51:40] <seutje> function(key, value) { /* no mention of key or value whatsoever */ }
[05:51:40] <Tomashe> the first loop loading teh details from my own server
[05:52:06] <Tomashe> the second loop update those details with the results that i want to take from external thirdparty map service
[05:52:27] <Tomashe> i did not want my app to be slow and show result onlya fter i get all responses from the thirdparty server , so i split them
[05:52:50] <seutje> $.each(json_result,function(key,value) { /* nor key, nor value is being used in here, what's the point of looping over the results when not using them? */ })
[05:53:06] <Tomashe> sure there are : json_result <
[05:53:22] <Tomashe> im suing them in the url, i just hiding it from u guys
[05:53:29] <Tomashe> cuz its contains a keys and stuff
[05:53:41] <BrazenBraden> is i have a string like "[a][b][c]", and would like to get out [a,b,c], i know I can pass a regex to the js split function, but have no idea how to make that regex.. who can help with that?
[05:54:04] <fabioportieri> .split("][") ?
[05:54:15] <seutje> '[a', 'b', 'c]'
[05:54:23] <fabioportieri> err
[05:54:26] <BrazenBraden> yea..
[05:54:31] <BrazenBraden> no [] in the result
[05:54:41] <BrazenBraden> must basically extract out the chars
[05:54:43] <BrazenBraden> drop all []
[05:54:45] <Jacta> is there a way to get http://is.gd/z7FTJZ to work correct - when I choose a month and open again, it shows jan 2014 again - i want it to show correct month somehow
[05:54:49] <seutje> shift, pop and then split? :D
[05:55:09] <BrazenBraden> seutje: wouldnt a regex make more sense?
[05:56:46] <fabioportieri> BrazenBraden: nah
[05:59:25] <PatBateman> any idea how to solve a mouseenter/mouseleave problem, causing form submit failure?
[05:59:59] <fabioportieri> PatBateman: more context please
[06:00:00] <seutje> BrazenBraden: wait, u want this as a string?
[06:00:15] <BrazenBraden> no. and array os strings
[06:00:46] <BrazenBraden> im sniffing something like:  /\[\w*\]/
[06:01:48] <PatBateman> fabioportieri, I have me/ml event bind to the page to show or hide something. in a specific div the mouseleave effect fires, but in the div is af orm that cant be submitted, even the radio buttons cant be changed. if I comment out this me/mo effect all good
[06:02:24] <PatBateman> so some why the mouseenter disturbs the form
[06:02:51] <fabioportieri> maybe because you hide the form with display:none
[06:03:07] <PatBateman> not hiding anything
[06:04:03] <seutje> js> var foo = '[a][b][c]'; foo = foo.split(''); foo.shift(); foo.pop(); foo.join('').split(']['); print(foo);
[06:04:04] <fabioportieri> mm you should paste the code
[06:04:09] <b-ot> seutje: a,],[,b,],[,c
[06:04:13] <seutje> WAT?
[06:04:42] <BrazenBraden> got it
[06:05:05] <seutje> riiight
[06:05:08] <BrazenBraden> regex = /\[(.*?)\]/
[06:05:11] <seutje> js> var foo = '[a][b][c]'; foo = foo.split(''); foo.shift(); foo.pop(); foo = foo.join('').split(']['); print(foo);
[06:05:21] <b-ot> seutje: a,b,c
[06:06:33] <manuelbieh> guys, long problem made short: $(document).on('click', 'a', handler) doesnt work but $(document.body).on('click', 'a', handler) does. is this a known bug or what am i possibly doing wrong? (short on time so i cant build an isolated problem showcase)
[06:09:04] <seutje> manuelbieh: weird, I thought jQuery ironed out that discrepancy
[06:23:40] <delboy1978uk> I'm trying to send a bunch of HTML over ajax, get or post doesn't really matter, how do i encode the html so it comes out on the other side looking the same?
[06:24:19] <Cork> delboy1978uk: just send it normally
[06:24:42] <Cork> you might want to ensure you send it as utf8
[06:24:49] <delboy1978uk> ok i thought i had to encode it or something, thought i'd ask first. trying now, cheers :-D
[06:24:57] <delboy1978uk> yeah its all utf-8
[06:25:39] <slax0r> you can encode it, but it wont help much
[06:26:09] <slax0r> you can also encrypt it if you want
[06:31:50] <mukwenhac> does, jquery $.ajax accept a path alias, for example /business as opposite to a php file?
[06:32:50] <fabioportieri> mukwenhac: you can put a string
[06:33:01] <Cork> mukwenhac: javascript knows nothing about files
[06:33:10] <Cork> all it knows is the url's the server provides
[06:33:46] <Cork> (and the mimetype it sends on those url's)
[06:34:57] <mukwenhac> alright great, it's not actually working for me right now. any way for me to debug $.ajax easily? and pinpoint where the fault lies?
[06:35:30] <Cork> mukwenhac: open the browser network console
[06:35:39] <Cork> and look at the url it requests
[06:35:53] <Cork> (and what the server sends back)
[06:35:58] <mukwenhac> Cork: thanks!
[06:36:09] <seutje> make sure u check mime type
[06:36:32] <seutje> if it's drupal, make super sure to check mime type :P
[06:38:57] <mukwenhac> thanks folks, I got it to work finally!!
[06:39:19] <mukwenhac> seutje funny you should mention drupal. i ditched it a couple of months ago
[06:39:26] <mukwenhac> it's too bloated
[06:40:55] <BillCriswell> I'm just now learning Drupal. I can't say it's the best time, but it's not as terrible as I expected.
[06:41:00] * jugstah is away. Automatically set away [SZon]
[06:42:21] <mukwenhac> I guess it depends with how you're using it and what you've to do with it. for development, i had to peel off too many layers to understand it, finally got frustrating. with micro frameworks i actually work faster
[06:44:53] <BillCriswell> mukwenhac: Yeah, for smaller stuff I've been pretty happy with just doing things in mixture.
[06:45:15] <BillCriswell> Not a framework really... just kind of a tool.
[06:48:33] <seutje> mukwenhac: I've recently joined the core maintainers for the javascript component, and I have to say, it's already looking a lot better than the state it was in!
[06:48:45] <seutje> but 8 will be infinitely more complex :D
[06:50:03] <mukwenhac> lol how's that a great thing? we want simple things
[06:53:04] <jugstah> I have to concur, simplicity is important. not all of us are rocket scientists :-)
[07:02:51] <Jonta> How can I make this sort-script case-insensitive? From http://stackoverflow.com/a/19947532/36948 - Demo: http://jsfiddle.net/Zhd2X/21
[07:04:45] <seutje> Jonta: looks like ur just sorting on index
[07:05:02] <seutje> oh, didn't see the getCellValue
[07:05:24] <Jonta> =)
[07:05:24] <seutje> Jonta: in the getCellValue, just toLowerCase everything
[07:05:31] <seutje> also, u might wanna grab text instead of html
[07:05:39] <Jonta> Great, testing…
[07:05:40] <seutje> unless u wanna sort <p> vs <a> and shit like that
[07:05:57] <Jonta> That would probably improve performance, right?
[07:07:41] <seutje> Jonta: well, it depends, but will be marginal either way
[07:07:53] <seutje> I was thinking more accuracy-wise
[07:08:03] <Jonta> Hm, cases where it would matter?
[07:08:14] <Jonta> This is just going to be used for an HTML-table.
[07:09:14] <seutje> well, if one cell has a link and the other don't...
[07:09:37] <seutje> like <td>foo</td> vs <td><a href="#">bar</a></td>
[07:09:39] <Jonta> No links =)
[07:09:42] <xqo> if i have var x = $("#asd"); how can i retrieve "#asd" from x?
[07:09:50] <seutje> u probably wanna sort foo vs bar and not foo vs <a
[07:10:24] <seutje> xqo: x.selector
[07:10:24] <Jonta> Mrr, I'm so new to all this. Priority is getting it case-insensitive.
[07:10:26] <dandrews_> x.prop('id') ?
[07:10:43] <dandrews_> it won't return with the # though
[07:10:50] <xqo> seutje thank youy
[07:10:57] <dandrews_> so it'd be '#' + x.prop('id')
[07:11:46] <seutje> Jonta: it probably doesn't matter in your use-case, I'm just trained to think of edge-cases
[07:13:32] <Jonta> seutje: My brain works the same way. I'm a little out of my depth here though. I've tried adding .toLowerCase first after "getCellValue(a, index)" and "getCellValue(b, index)", and then to "return $.isNumeric(valA)" and "$.isNumeric(valB)" on the line below. Neither seems to work.
[07:14:18] <seutje> Jonta: oh, I meant changing the getCellValue function to like function getCellValue(row, index){ return $(row).children('td').eq(index).html().toLowerCase(); }
[07:15:40] <Jonta> seutje: *facepalm*. Several occurences of getCellValue. Line #14 it is.
[07:16:02] <seutje> Jonta: yeah, where it's defined
[07:16:08] <seutje> DRY, man, DRY :D
[07:16:18] <Jonta> Hehe
[07:21:05] <xqo> is this not a valid selector? $("#-pane-irc.freenode.net")
[07:21:27] <seutje> xqo: are those dots part of the ID?
[07:21:30] <xqo> yes
[07:21:32] <seutje> if so, you need to escape them
[07:21:41] <seutje> $("#-pane-irc\.freenode\.net")
[07:21:46] <xqo> is this not a valid selector? $("#-pane-irc\.freenode\.net")?
[07:21:49] <xqo> ok thanks
[07:22:06] <seutje> otherwise it will interpret it as id="-pane-irc" class="freenode net"
[07:24:41] <NoiseEee> xqo: odd use of IDs. code smell.
[07:24:55] <xqo> is ! a valid character in selectors and ids?
[07:25:26] <NoiseEee> i can't see why one would possibly use it as an ID, but tias
[07:25:26] <xqo> i need a character that is not valid for irc nicknames, but is valid for ids and selectors.
[07:27:24] <seutje> `g id just got classy mathias
[07:27:26] <b-ot> seutje: The id attribute got more classy in HTML5 · Mathias Bynens → http://mathiasbynens.be/notes/html5-id-class
[07:27:49] <seutje> xqo: ^ everything (almost) is a valid character for an ID, just a pain in the ass to address it afterwards
[07:28:25] <xqo> what about :?
[07:28:48] <seutje> as long as you escape it... sure
[07:29:01] <xqo> ick. ok thanks l0l
[07:29:08] <seutje> but I would like to stress once again that ur pretty much setting urself up for a world of hurt
[07:29:50] <Jonta> seutje: Hm, still something about it that doesn't work. Have to go home now, but will continue to work on it there. See you in a bit?
[07:31:53] <seutje> Jonta: perhaps, but I'ma be heading home a minute as well
[07:35:05] <Tomashe> seutje: hey mate
[07:35:10] <Tomashe> did u find the solution?
[07:37:38] <seutje> Tomashe: I didn't realize I was looking for one
[07:39:56] <fabioportieri> [Quit: LAVORO IN TELEVISIONE]  weird
[07:50:55] <Musk> Can sometell me how come this works in Chrome but doesn't in any other browsers http://pastie.org/8639367
[07:53:11] <Musk> Ok just tested it works on IE 10
[08:13:02] <BillCriswell> Musk: It's not working in firefox? Also, the code seems weird. Sure you're using it right?
[08:17:02] <Tomashe> i got an array which contain distances from a specific location, the problem is that distances are random and when i loop them i get it random. wondering if i can make my loop by the lowest number
[08:17:09] <sky> if I add a new element with a class that's bound to change, do I have to do anything special? I seem to have a problem where when a new instance of the class is added, the trigger isnt fired
[08:18:51] <BillCriswell> Tomashe: You want to sort it?
[08:20:47] <BillCriswell> sky: A hard time following you. If you do $('.foo').on('change', doSomething); and add an element with the class foo after that it won't work.
[08:21:14] <Tomashe> yes
[08:21:26] <sky> so I have to do document on change then?
[08:21:30] <sky> cuz that works...
[08:21:37] <sky> just tryin to understand why
[08:21:49] <BillCriswell> sky: Yeah, or the closest parent that isn't changing.
[08:22:01] <sky> why is that
[08:22:13] <BillCriswell> sky: It doesn't work because it doesn't exist when the events are applied.
[08:22:30] <BillCriswell> Well, event listener.
[08:22:38] <sky> right
[08:22:52] <sky> kinda weird. why wiouldnt the event listener look for new elements when they are added ? :)
[08:23:18] <BillCriswell> sky: It would be inefficient I guess.
[08:23:58] <BillCriswell> $('.parent').on('click', '.child', function(){ /* This will fire no matter when a .child is added to the .parent <div> */ });
[08:24:44] <BillCriswell> I guess $('.ancestor').on('click', '.descendant', doSomething); would make more sense.
[08:25:30] <sky> well, I'm adding/removing form elements and discovered the issue :D
[08:27:04] <sky> thanks
[08:27:17] <BillCriswell> No problem!
[08:27:32] <BillCriswell> Tomashe: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/sort
[08:28:19] <cc11rocks> I can sometimes get $("#id").append("data") to work. It is not now... However, the console.log action is working...
[08:29:05] <BillCriswell> Does #id exist before you try to apply it?
[08:29:59] <cc11rocks> Oh
[08:30:10] <cc11rocks> Sorry. I forgot the "#" for the method.
[08:30:24] <cc11rocks> Thanks for the help.
[08:30:53] <cc11rocks> [Was doing $("div381") instead of $("#div381")]
[08:31:19] <BillCriswell> Haha there you go.
[08:38:41] <myosotis> I'm trying to modify the behavior of a sortable jquery ui widget. How can I add an 'onUpdate' event handler for instance, that runs after whatever callback is configured already?
[08:39:01] <myosotis> basically, I want to run an event handler after the pre-existing one
[08:39:55] <myosotis> do they perhaps run in the order they were bound in?
[08:39:58] <Tomashe> BillCriswell: lets check it out ;)
[08:40:31] <krambiorix> hi, $("#fileuploadpreviewpanel").scrollTop(0);   scrolls the div to the top but the scroll bar doesn't move.... What can i do?
[08:43:24] <dandrews_> so you want the body to scroll to the top?
[08:44:58] <krambiorix> dandrews_, no, my div has an overflow: scroll  and  shows a vertical scroll bar...  I want the div to be scrolled to the top
[08:46:20] <dandrews_> and that works for you, but the scrollbar doesn't move? hmm
[08:46:37] <krambiorix> dandrews_, yes sir
[08:48:37] <dandrews_> http://jsbin.com/iKEREvEH/1/ does the scroll bar move for you here when you click the button?
[08:49:18] <krambiorix> dandrews_, yes
[08:51:39] <krambiorix> hmm weird
[08:54:18] <dandrews_> very
[08:58:51] <foo> Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected end of input  index:1  - is this a common issue that means something? It's not linked to anything
[08:59:32] <ahandy> Hi guys, I am trying to achieve a parallax-like website as you can see on http://projects2013.grindd.com/GP/, however this is buggy when you scroll down/up very quickly, so i was hoping you could point me in the right direction as to what the suitable plugins or coding techniques might be
[09:03:49] <Jacta> is there a way to get http://is.gd/z7FTJZ to work correct - when I choose a month and open again, it shows jan 2014 again - i want it to show correct month somehow
[09:11:30] <BillCriswell> ##math makes me feel dumb.
[09:20:39] <vsoftoiletpaper> hello how can I consult documentation for older versions of jquery like 1.9?
[09:21:41] <duch_kazatel> vsoftoiletpaper that's new enough that the current docs should still be mostly relevant.
[09:21:51] <vsoftoiletpaper> http://api.jquery.com/animate/
[09:22:31] <duch_kazatel> that should still be pretty current.
[09:23:28] <vsoftoiletpaper> duch_kazatel https://dpaste.de/XTAb
[09:23:47] <duch_kazatel> mind crating a fiddle?
[09:23:54] <duch_kazatel> so i can run it in the browser?
[09:24:07] <vsoftoiletpaper> Uncaught TypeError: Object #<Object> has no method 'easeInOutQuad'
[09:24:54] <duch_kazatel> and you have jquery ui installed?
[09:25:46] <duch_kazatel> http://api.jqueryui.com/easings/
[09:27:12] <vsoftoiletpaper> duch_kazatel  ://jsfiddle.net/3u5LA/
[09:27:17] <vsoftoiletpaper> http://jsfiddle.net/3u5LA/
[09:27:39] <duch_kazatel> and you have jqueryui installed?
[09:28:03] <vsoftoiletpaper> no..
[09:28:12] <duch_kazatel> easeInOutQuad is only available in jqueryui
[09:28:13] <vsoftoiletpaper> didn't know it was necessary
[09:28:18] <duch_kazatel> it isn't.
[09:28:29] <duch_kazatel> but if you want to use that easing by name, you have to install jqueryUI
[09:28:37] <vsoftoiletpaper> duch_kazatel only linear and swing in normal jquery?
[09:28:49] <duch_kazatel> wouldn't surprise me.  you can also define your own.
[09:43:03] <fabioportieri> what would you say to someone who rudely claims jquery is outdated (because perform dom manipulation)
[09:43:23] <duch_kazatel> "because perform dom manipulation"?
[09:43:25] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[09:43:51] <duch_kazatel> they're saying jquery is outdated because it does dom manipulation?
[09:43:54] <fabioportieri> duch_kazatel: yeah he says "with angular you don't need to do that" "it's too much low level"
[09:44:02] <fabioportieri> duch_kazatel: exactly
[09:44:04] <fabioportieri> i told him
[09:44:13] <fabioportieri> angular uses jqlite for dom manipulation too
[09:44:22] <fabioportieri> jqlite being a lite version of jquery
[09:44:31] <duch_kazatel> jquery and angular do two completely different things.
[09:44:44] <duch_kazatel> angular is about binding your model to your view so that one can update the other.
[09:44:54] <dandrews_> jquery = imperative. angular = declarative. thats really the big difference; and like mentioned above, angular uses a lite version of jquery
[09:45:14] <duch_kazatel> they serve different purposes entirely imo.
[09:45:44] <fabioportieri> one is a webapp framework the other js framework yea
[09:45:47] <duch_kazatel> angular is much more in the realm of backbone and another MV* frameworks.  jquery is all about making shit pretty.
[09:45:50] <dandrews_> right. the better comparison would be backbone + jquery vs angular
[09:47:26] <dandrews_> when it comes to data in the dom, angular shines over backbone + jquery in my opinion in the way they handle it. not to say you couldn't do it well with backbone and jquery, they just take an entirely different approach to the normal integration (going back to imperative vs declarative)
[09:47:56] <duch_kazatel> angular has a different opinion about how those kinds of things should be accomplished.
[09:48:13] <duch_kazatel> and that's fine - but that doesn't make jquery a bad thing.  jquery serves a different need.
[09:48:52] <fabioportieri> i couldn't agree more, too bad the fucker permbanned me :]
[09:49:04] <duch_kazatel> huh?  where was this?
[09:49:09] <fabioportieri> a java channel
[09:49:20] <duch_kazatel> weird.
[09:49:31] <fabioportieri> well.. if full of weirdos
[09:49:33] <fabioportieri> is
[09:51:02] <fabioportieri> bye bye see tomorrow
[09:56:55] <vsoftoiletpaper> http://codepen.io/anon/pen/xsuhA
[09:57:02] <vsoftoiletpaper> when you click in animate
[09:57:12] <vsoftoiletpaper> before shrinking, it increases a little bit
[09:57:55] <vsoftoiletpaper> and idea why?
[09:58:55] <duch_kazatel> the default padding on the p.
[09:59:43] <duch_kazatel> http://codepen.io/anon/pen/snlhv
[10:00:23] <dandrews_> margin
[10:00:34] <foo> Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected end of input  index:1  - is this a common issue that means something? It's not linked to anything, hmm
[10:00:37] <duch_kazatel> err, yeah margin.  my bad.
[10:00:45] <mehwork> how come when i $(document).on('tap', '#cancel', function() { alert('test'); } it does the alert when i hit the cancel button, as expected, but then it also alerts again when i touch anywhere on the entire screen?
[10:01:19] <duch_kazatel> foo "it's not linked to anything" - sure about that?
[10:01:28] <dandrews_> sounds like some sort of bubbling /guess
[10:02:03] <duch_kazatel> mehwork that sounds wrong.  what is #cancel?  JUST the botton?  or does it contain anything else?
[10:02:47] <foo> duch_kazatel: hm, I wonder if there is an extra space at the top of the page output
[10:03:02] <duch_kazatel> foo wat
[10:03:37] <duch_kazatel> foo you can have whitespace at the top of your document - it will not cause problems.
[10:04:00] <foo> duch_kazatel: yeah, nevermind, hah.
[10:04:11] <duch_kazatel> foo your code likely has somewthing flipped around.
[10:04:25] <vsoftoiletpaper> there is a glitch in this animation: http://codepen.io/anon/pen/xsuhA
[10:04:27] <vsoftoiletpaper> any idea why?
[10:04:50] <duch_kazatel> vsoftoiletpaper i all ready sent you the fix.
[10:04:54] <foo> duch_kazatel: like what? hmm
[10:05:01] <duch_kazatel> foo what's your code?
[10:05:02] <vsoftoiletpaper> duch_kazatel my connection droped
[10:05:17] <vsoftoiletpaper> didn't receive it
[10:05:25] <duch_kazatel> vsoftoiletpaper it's the margin on p.  http://codepen.io/anon/pen/snlhv
[10:06:11] <vsoftoiletpaper> duch_kazatel why is the margin a problem?
[10:06:42] <vsoftoiletpaper> I'm guessing jquery is calulating the height instead of asking the browser the height?
[10:06:54] <duch_kazatel> vsoftoiletpaper probably because of how the animate function calulates height.
[10:07:09] <duch_kazatel> your containing element technically isn't big enough to fix that p as is.
[10:07:12] <duch_kazatel> fit
[10:07:24] <vsoftoiletpaper> duch_kazatel the height isn't fixed
[10:07:37] <vsoftoiletpaper> I thought it was because of margin collapse
[10:07:56] <foo> duch_kazatel: may I DM you the page? It's rather simple
[10:08:36] <duch_kazatel> vsoftoiletpaper basically, yeah.  it is.  the two margins you've got are having problems.
[10:08:43] <duch_kazatel> removing the default margin on the p fixes it.
[10:08:53] <duch_kazatel> foo why not just paste a fiddle into the channel?
[10:08:54] <vsoftoiletpaper> duch_kazatel but margin collapse  is a css feature
[10:09:07] <vsoftoiletpaper> shouldn't jquery handle it?
[10:09:30] <duch_kazatel> jquery animations are a funky and mysterious thing.  removing the margin on the p fixes your problem.
[10:09:35] <duch_kazatel> why is that not acceptable?
[10:13:02] <vsoftoiletpaper> duch_kazatel it is acceptable thank you much
[10:13:12] <vsoftoiletpaper> just wondering if a but report should be opened
[10:13:25] <duch_kazatel> nope.  functioning as intended.
[10:15:50] <duch_kazatel> the other way to do it is to animate the p instead.
[10:17:26] <Fraz> anyone know if its possible to jump to a css3 keyfram percentage?
[10:18:01] <mehwork> duch_kazatel: it's a button but it's an <a href="javascript:void(0)">
[10:18:49] <duch_kazatel> why are you mixing js into your markup like that, mehwork?
[10:21:09] <mehwork> duch_kazatel: legacy codebase. i just need to fix this bug for now
[10:21:28] <mehwork> it's also using jquery mobile
[10:22:00] <mehwork> what's weird is this double event issue only happens on mobile tap, but not when i click the button
[10:31:02] <Tomashe> damn i find it really hard to make position fixed on mobile
[10:31:06] <Tomashe> any ideas guys
[10:42:36] <jamespeerless> any idea why my default header bars in jqmobile are gray instead of the black?
[10:43:46] <onenine90> hello everyone. A lot of my buttons are not firing the on click - bound event on the first try. I sometimes have to click even 3 times. Any tips on troubleshooting these types of issues? I use query's $('#element_id').bind(function(){}); to accomplish his
[10:44:12] <duch_kazatel> onenine90 use .on('click', function(){}); instead.
[10:44:33] <onenine90> I thought they did the same thing
[10:44:42] <onenine90> doesn't on('click' use bind
[10:45:00] <BinaryKitten> bind is old form
[10:45:14] <duch_kazatel> bind is deprecated as of 1.7 iirc
[10:45:17] <BinaryKitten> it's only there for legacy support
[10:45:33] <duch_kazatel> and even with .bind() you have so specify the eventtype
[10:45:39] <onenine90> thanks guys i'll try out onclick
[10:45:51] <onenine90> is it known to be better?
[10:46:00] <duch_kazatel> it's the current way of doing things.
[10:46:03] <BinaryKitten> not better .. just cleaner
[10:46:07] <onenine90> and is it common to get this issue I'm having? or am I maybe doing something wrong
[10:46:08] <duch_kazatel> most convenience methods use it under the hood.
[10:46:22] <duch_kazatel> onenine90 i just told you that your version of bind is wrong, as well.
[10:46:27] <duch_kazatel> swap to .on() and use it instead.
[10:46:39] <BinaryKitten> onenine90 create a jsfiddle of your code
[10:46:40] <onenine90> and then I asked a follow up question buddy
[10:46:54] <BinaryKitten> only way we can actually make a proper judgement call
[10:46:55] <onenine90> I meant something in addition to that
[10:46:58] <onenine90> ok thanks giuys
[10:47:35] <duch_kazatel> i was simply making light that your issue is initially because you're using .bind() wrong, but you also should just use .on() instead.
[10:48:54] <onenine90> thanks i appreciate the help
[11:09:52] <mukwenhac> after executing $.ajax and saving returned result in a variables, how can i access that value later in the script…outside of $.ajax() context
[11:10:26] <Tomashe> damn i find it really hard to make position fixed on mobile, any ideas?
[11:10:37] <duch_kazatel> mukwenhac you need to define the var in a higher schope.
[11:11:30] <duch_kazatel> mukwenhac at the top of your script to something like var ajaxResult = {}; then inside of your ajax call, set ajaxResult to the returned data.
[11:12:07] <duch_kazatel> then use ajaxResult wherever you want the data.
[11:12:21] <duch_kazatel> that's one way, at least.
[11:12:35] <mukwenhac> duch_kazatel let me give it a shot!
[11:12:40] <mukwenhac> thanks
[11:13:05] <Tomashe> HMM
[11:13:19] <duch_kazatel> mukwenhac learn about scope in javascript :)
[11:13:32] <duch_kazatel> Tomashe not sure what you mean by your question - sounds like a css problem :)
[11:18:29] <mukwenhac> thanks duch_kazatel
[11:18:51] <duch_kazatel> mukwenhac did that work?
[11:18:52] <mukwenhac> i tried your suggestion but it says "undefined" when i try to alert(variable)
[11:18:58] <mukwenhac> the code is this: http://jsfiddle.net/YWyrF/
[11:19:59] <duch_kazatel> console.log(data[0].aid) right before that result assignment in your success callback to make sure that's an actual thing.
[11:20:46] <mukwenhac> yes that had worked before the assignment to result variable
[11:21:20] <duch_kazatel> so you're hitting the success callback.  hrm.
[11:21:26] <duch_kazatel> and that actually returns something.
[11:21:37] <mukwenhac> yes, i just checked again
[11:22:44] <duch_kazatel> interesting.
[11:32:14] <BillCriswell> I'm so tired of having to debug like 10 devices.
[11:32:42] <cortexman> when i press enter this code prints "enter" almost 5000 times https://gist.github.com/brianmingus/2b706742ddb394154812
[11:39:02] <miql> hey, muck, i'm assuming you removed the valid part of that URI in the success callback?
[11:39:38] <Tomashe> http://jsfiddle.net/8CXra/ < anyone knows why the second click() isnt triggering the first action?
[11:43:10] <NoiseEee> try .trigger('click')
[11:44:03] <Tomashe> hmm
[11:44:54] <NoiseEee> Tomashe: also, if you basically just want to run the function in that first 'click', take it out of the handler, make it a function accesible to both
[11:45:28] <Tomashe> nop isnt workig
[11:45:52] <NoiseEee> consider an approach like http://jsfiddle.net/8CXra/1/
[11:47:10] <Tomashe> pet that was working
[11:47:13] <Tomashe> :)
[11:47:14] <Tomashe> thanks bro
[11:47:29] <NoiseEee> understand why your approach was basically silly/not correct
[11:47:43] <mattinahat> Can anyone help me with creating my JSON object completely before it gets posted? I'm new to jquery
[11:47:57] <mattinahat> I put everything I have so far here: http://jsbin.com/IRExajA/1/edit
[11:48:09] <Tomashe> yes i understand it now
[11:49:27] <mattinahat> the variable myData.accuracy never gets set before everything is posted.
[11:50:26] <jtoy> what is the simplest way I can remove and re-add certain form elements?
[11:50:40] <jtoy> so that different stuff gets submitted based?
[11:51:05] <jtoy> i could just switch out completely different forms
[11:59:59] <mattinahat> My problem is getGeo() returns but it has two other calls that need to finish before it returns.
[12:02:14] <mattinahat> So I guess my question is how do I make getData wait for getGeo() and all of the things getGeo() does?
[12:17:16] <hesco> I'm looking for a sample to adapt from showing me qunit tests of a $('selector').show() or .hide() operation.  Can anyone please point me to an example?  The samples I have seen do not address that specific option.
[12:20:07] <jtoy> can I stop disable certain form elements from being submitted?
[12:20:14] <jtoy> like hide but for form elements
[12:20:37] <Tomashe> another question regarding jquery mobile. and css fixed
[12:20:41] <donkeycongo> When I bind a click-handler to a submit-input, it prevents it from submitting the form. How do I avoid this?
[12:20:41] <hesco> sorry, never mind, perhaps I have found something useful after all, third party site, though the qunit tutorals themselves seem to gloass overf that one
[12:21:06] <Tomashe> anyone knows how to handle that issue with jquery. seems like iphone browser is not compatable with it
[12:22:58] <BillCriswell> jtoy: You can use the disabled attribute.
[12:23:52] <BillCriswell> donkeycongo: Adding a click handler shouldn't stop the form from submitting unless you're doing event.preventDefault() or return false;
[12:24:30] <NoiseEee> Tomashe: its certainly compat with it.  don't watch for things on 'document' though, they don't bubble up that high iirc
[12:24:54] <NoiseEee> actually might not even bubble up to body on iOS, Tomashe
[12:25:18] <NoiseEee> Tomashe: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10165141/jquery-on-and-delegate-doesnt-work-on-ipad
[12:26:14] <Tomashe> hmm
[12:26:24] <jamespeerless> has 1.4 jam default theme switched to grey? i thought its supposed to be dark/black?
[12:26:35] <Tomashe> NoiseEee, im talking about position fixed for headers
[12:26:42] <Tomashe> and footer
[12:26:47] <NoiseEee> what does that have to do with jquery?
[12:26:58] <duch_kazatel> NoiseEee I said almost the same thing earlier.
[12:27:17] <donkeycongo> BillCriswell: Weird, cause Im not doing either. I return true.
[12:27:57] <Tomashe> there are some browsers that are not suport in it , so im asking if there is any jquery plugin or fix, that fix it
[12:28:11] <jtoy> BillCriswell: awesome, thanks!
[12:29:04] <BillCriswell> What if you don't return true?
[12:29:38] <duch_kazatel> git checkout origin/master com
[12:29:42] <duch_kazatel> woops wrong window haha
[12:30:20] <Otineb> hi all
[12:30:24] <Otineb> I'm trying to use the load() method to target an element's parent. My syntax currently is $(this).next('.imgThumb').load(link[1]+ ' #thumbimg:parent'); but that's not working at all. I'm not really sure how to get a similar effect like .parent() or .closest('a') within the load method. Any help would be awesome.
[12:31:10] <duch_kazatel> Otineb you want to do your magic in the complete callback for .load().
[12:31:25] <duch_kazatel> or use $.ajax(), since its syntax tends to be a little less confusion.
[12:31:27] <Otineb> hey again duch_kazatel !
[12:31:43] <duch_kazatel> unless you are trying to bind to the "load" event.
[12:31:54] <duch_kazatel> in which case you should use .on('load', hander) instead.
[12:32:48] <donkeycongo> BillCriswell: Makes no difference.
[12:32:56] <BillCriswell> donkeycongo: I would need to see your code then.
[12:33:13] <NoiseEee> Tomashe: ask in css maybe?  again, your question has nothing to do with jquery  /  google about iphone/ipad/jquery/mobile ?
[12:33:18] <BillCriswell> Binding on the click event of a submit button would be bad to do anyway.
[12:33:41] <donkeycongo> BillCriswell: http://jsfiddle.net/nPEUW/
[12:37:12] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/nPEUW/2/ - seems to do things.
[12:37:16] <duch_kazatel> what's the issue, donkeycongo?
[12:37:28] <Onionnion> Can anyone tell me why it continues to run the function on click even after I remove the "editcat" class? http://jsfiddle.net/Windsock/7Ps8H/2/
[12:37:39] <donkeycongo> duch_kazatel: It wont submit the form
[12:38:01] <duch_kazatel> donkeycongo you want to bind to the form submission event, not the button click.
[12:38:29] <BillCriswell> I guess disabling the submit button is keeping the form from submitting, interesting. Anyway, this should do it: http://jsfiddle.net/nPEUW/3/
[12:39:23] <Otineb> duch_kazatel: Not sure if I need to bind the load (a bit of a noob), but the end goal is to grab an element from with a link and drop in a placeholder. The issue is the wrapping href tag (or any reasonable wrapper above that) has no class/id i can select easily. I know if I can get the syntax right, I can rely on "find #thumbimg, then grab its parent (href)"
[12:39:41] <duch_kazatel> Onionnion because your event binding is getting cached.  use event delegation instead: http://jsfiddle.net/7Ps8H/3/
[12:39:48] <jedimind> why not just like http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qa7rFBpTTaE
[12:39:51] <jedimind> for loading states
[12:40:09] <Onionnion> duch_kazatel, thanks!
[12:40:32] <duch_kazatel> Otineb have a fiddle?
[12:40:37] <jedimind> I HAVE A FIDDLE
[12:40:56] <duch_kazatel> Onionnion you'll want to change the $('body') to something more specific in your document.
[12:41:00] <duch_kazatel> jedimind what are you asking?
[12:41:06] <jedimind> im not
[12:41:09] <duch_kazatel> hah
[12:41:13] <jedimind> i just have a fiddle
[12:41:17] <duch_kazatel> good :)
[12:41:34] <jedimind> ... which i occasionaly diddle
[12:41:45] <duch_kazatel> i prefer to faddle instead.
[12:41:52] <Otineb> duch_kazatel: http://jsfiddle.net/tf98J/2/
[12:42:04] <onenine90> I'm haven a really hard time trying to resize a canvas element. it always looks jagged / sharp. not smooth. I've tried all the research I can handle. Figured I'd try here one time
[12:42:33] <donkeycongo> BillCriswell, duch_kazatel: Great. Thanks both :)
[12:42:45] <duch_kazatel> Otineb so what exactly are you looking to accomplish and when?
[12:43:25] <Otineb> duch_kazatel: Row 15 is where I think i need help. The fiddle works in a live environment, except i'm only pulling in the img. Turns out I need to include that image's containing href
[12:44:35] <duch_kazatel> Otineb .load() is very confusion because it's actually two very different methods with the same name, but the behavior changes depending on what you feed it.
[12:44:35] <Otineb> duch_kazatel: so something like ('imgSelector').parent() would be idea, but that syntax isn't working in the load()
[12:45:13] <duch_kazatel> Otineb .load() can be an event binding OR an ajax thing.  which are you trying to do?
[12:45:59] <duch_kazatel> or if neither of those, are you just trying to stick an image on the page?
[12:48:34] <Otineb> duch_kazatel: sorry, boss called. I'm agnostic to the method. I'm just trying to retrieve a known element from with in a series of links and stick that element on the page
[12:48:51] <duch_kazatel> okay, then load is not what you want.
[12:49:04] <duch_kazatel> but you're not "Agnostic to the method" - those are two very different concepts.
[12:49:14] <Otineb> duch_kazatel: hah
[12:50:06] <Otineb> duch_kazatel: do you think ajax() is the way to go?
[12:57:52] <duch_kazatel> Otineb I have no idea what you mean by "stick that element on the page".
[12:58:14] <duch_kazatel> Otineb are you calling your server for new HTML?  or are you just trying to take HTML on the current page and place it somewhere else?
[12:58:30] <Otineb> duch_kazatel: Calling for new
[12:58:38] <duch_kazatel> then use ajax
[12:58:42] <Otineb> ok
[12:58:47] <duch_kazatel> because .load() is very confusing.
[12:58:55] <duch_kazatel> and you're not even using it correctly :)
[12:59:05] <Otineb> lol agreed
[12:59:09] <duch_kazatel> if you're married to .load();, you need to feed it a URL, not a selector.
[12:59:35] <Otineb> duch_kazatel: not married to it at all
[13:01:38] <Otineb> the html Im trying to retrieve just happens to be in a dynamically generated link. So the only way I can think about it as by iterating through each link, grabbing a DOM element that lives IN that link's HTML and dropping the entire element into the current page. (I'm trying to get thumbnail previews to show up - saving the user a click)
[13:01:55] <duch_kazatel> mind tossing that fiddle back over?
[13:02:15] <Otineb> duch_kazatel: original send  = http://jsfiddle.net/tf98J/2/
[13:02:44] <Otineb> duch_kazatel: here's my untested WIP code with ajax instead http://jsfiddle.net/tf98J/3/
[13:02:48] <duch_kazatel> yeah, so in load you're trying to pass it a URL and a div ID.
[13:03:27] <duch_kazatel> what are you doing with that .match on the anchor?
[13:03:37] <Otineb> yes. Based on what I read (incorrectly it seems) load() looks for a url to load and an optional element
[13:04:18] <Otineb> the url I'm grabbing is currently embedded in a javascript call (e.g. href="javascript:openWin('showorder.asp?order=2164&approve=1&load=1');")
[13:04:38] <duch_kazatel> ooooooh.... that's why i don't embed js in markup like that.
[13:04:43] <Otineb> I'm using regex to strip it down to just 'showorder.asp?order=2164&approve=1&load=1'
[13:05:06] <Otineb> duch_kazatel: yea it's a bitch. I have no access to the markup at all
[13:06:21] <duch_kazatel> aaaah i see what you were doing now with the original version - you said you're just trying to grab an image?
[13:06:42] <duch_kazatel> why don't you have the source all ready available?
[13:07:41] <duch_kazatel> sorry, this entire setup seems very strange to me, so I'm trying wrap my head around it to give you a half decent solution.
[13:09:19] <Onionnion> I can't quite figure out how to have line 13 of this to work as I want it http://jsfiddle.net/Windsock/7Ps8H/6/ all it's supposed to do is enable the submit button but I don't see why it isn't
[13:10:40] <duch_kazatel> Onionnion because  $(this).closest("input[type='submit']") doesn't match anything.
[13:10:53] <Otineb> duch_kazatel: i really appreciate you trying. So what's happening at a high-level is these business cards are being ordered but they have to be approved by a person. That approver gets to see the page I'm working on. The problem is the page in question (we'll call it approve.html) doesn't display a thumbnail preview of each item listed. Instead the user has to click a stupid little link which popsup a preview with image. That's where th
[13:10:54] <Otineb> script comes in.
[13:11:34] <duch_kazatel> so the link has the image in it?
[13:11:36] <Otineb> so my script is attempting to grab the image element for the user and place directly in the list of orders awaiting action
[13:11:37] <Otineb> yes
[13:11:45] <Otineb> in the #imgthumb element
[13:11:45] <duch_kazatel> then you don't need any ajax.
[13:11:53] <Otineb> oh??
[13:12:00] <Onionnion> oh wait, duh. disabled is either on or off..
[13:12:38] <duch_kazatel> Otineb you need to create an image tag and set the src to the image ref.
[13:12:40] <Onionnion> there we go, sorry :P
[13:12:40] <duch_kazatel> that's all.
[13:14:23] <Otineb> duch_kazatel: how do I get the source of the img ref without first entering the page?
[13:14:45] <duch_kazatel> Otineb what does one of these links look like?
[13:15:08] <Otineb> let me clean up that fiddle a bit and send back
[13:15:29] <Otineb> duch_kazatel: but they look like this: href="javascript:openWin('showorder.asp?order=2164&approve=1&load=1');"
[13:15:48] <duch_kazatel> and showorder.asp?order=2164&approve=1&load=1 loads an image?
[13:15:53] <Otineb> no
[13:15:59] <duch_kazatel> what does it load, then?
[13:16:23] <Otineb> it's a whole new html doc. There's an element within it called #imgthumb that contains the image.
[13:17:03] <duch_kazatel> :( so it's a real hack on top of a hack.
[13:17:05] <Otineb> I've successfully used the load to get it and place it on the original page. The problem I'm facing now is I actually need to load the <img>'s wrapper (an href)
[13:17:07] <Otineb> totally
[13:17:48] <Otineb> i could screenshare it live if you want. PM me if you feel like it
[13:17:52] <hugo_moss> hello, why does jquery namespaced scroll events not trigger when scrolling in ie11?
[13:18:36] <duch_kazatel> Otineb sorry i'm at work, so I can't check out the screenshare.  either way, you'll have to do some parsing on the page with the ajas success callback.
[13:18:51] <Otineb> ok I'll keep tinkering with it
[13:18:55] <Otineb> thanks again man
[13:19:36] <duch_kazatel> sure - this is one of those where you'll at the very least learn some things :)
[13:19:42] <duch_kazatel> hugo_moss fiddle?
[13:28:03] <onenine90> dang. i'm still experience multiple issues with my on click events. I even am using .on('click') for everything
[13:28:13] <duch_kazatel> onenine90 fiddle link?
[13:28:14] <onenine90> are there any tools I can use to help figure this out?
[13:28:24] <onenine90> one sec
[13:28:29] <onenine90> it happens randomly too
[13:32:33] <duch_kazatel> onenine90 i doubt it's "random" ;)
[13:34:37] <dekiss> I check if element exist with jquery and if yes then execute a function but the function ets excecuted no matter the result why?
[13:34:39] <hugo_moss> nevermind, the namespace event wasn't the issue
[13:34:51] <duch_kazatel> dekiss how are you checking for existence?
[13:35:00] <dekiss> jQuery.fn.doesExist = function(){
[13:35:00] <dekiss>         return jQuery(this).length > 0;
[13:35:00] <dekiss>  };
[13:35:14] <duch_kazatel> and how are you using it?
[13:35:22] <dekiss> inside the function i have document.getElementById("arrowLeft").addEventListener("click", function (arrowE) {
[13:35:30] <duch_kazatel> could you make a fiddle?
[13:35:32] <dekiss> I get error can't call method addEve.. of null
[13:35:36] <dekiss> ah :S
[13:35:41] <dekiss> not really :S
[13:35:48] <dekiss> any idea?
[13:35:54] <dekiss> if ($('#arrowLeft').doesExist()) {
[13:36:12] <dekiss> its false I checked
[13:36:15] <dekiss> hm
[13:36:21] <duch_kazatel> wat
[13:36:31] <duch_kazatel> good luck with that then?
[13:36:34] <duch_kazatel> i gotta head out on lunch.
[13:36:36] <duch_kazatel> peace folks.
[13:36:44] <dekiss> ah the problem is not in this
[13:36:52] <dekiss> if I put false in if stil laI get the error
[13:36:57] <dekiss> :D
[13:36:59] <dekiss> haha
[13:37:03] <dekiss> ok
[13:43:53] <onenine90> What would cause less load time on a customer's browser with a web app? Setting my CDN to use HTTPS so all the "the page at xx was loaded over https but insecure blah" messages don't come up? Or just ignoring the msgs
[13:57:51] <nszceta> Hello all
[13:58:19] <nszceta> I am stumped by a particular issue I have been mulling over for the last 3 days:
[13:59:11] <nszceta> I have a table and I am trying to insert a new input element just after the <ul> (i.e. as an <input> inside the first <li> element)
[13:59:44] <nszceta> I have been able to do this with $('ul.layout-list').prepend('<input>');
[13:59:51] <tables> i'm trying to cut up 'var myvar' that's 100 character long into 10 character long segments, that will look like one variable which value is 'var1=first10characters&var2=second10characters&var3=third10characters' and so on
[13:59:51] <tables> split 100 character long variable into post parameters like so
[13:59:51] <nszceta> but I want to assign each input element a unique name
[14:00:02] <nszceta> and I have no idea how to do this
[14:07:42] <tables> i'm trying to cut up 'var myvar' that's 100 character long into 10 character long segments, that will look like one variable which value is 'var1=first10characters&var2=second10characters&var3=third10characters' and so on
[14:09:47] <BillCriswell> tables: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7033639/javascript-split-large-string-in-n-size-chunks then write a loop.

[14:12:03] <dijitaltrix> morning everyone.. I have a quick question regarding getScript().. when I include the google maps api script on my page my code works, but when I try call the maps api through getScript then init it in the callback it doesn't work? Is it because the maps API script calls further scripts?
[14:12:07] <tables> BillCriswell, i'm new to jquery :      http://jsfiddle.net/UXqtg/    <-- can you help me print my new array in #summary ?
[14:12:11] <tables> suffixed with <br>
[14:12:26] <tables> wait no
[14:12:27] <BillCriswell> Are you taking a test or something?
[14:12:39] <tables> prefixed with "q1="
[14:12:40] <tables> and so on
[14:12:45] <tables> q2=   then  q3=
[14:12:46] <tables> and so on
[14:13:00] <BillCriswell> The code I just gave you gets you like 95%  there.
[14:13:12] <tables> yea, but i'm way too new at jquery
[14:13:12] <tables> lol
[14:13:16] <tables> i don't even know how to print
[14:13:19] <tables> in a div
[14:13:32] <tables> it should look like
[14:13:36] <BillCriswell> .html('something')
[14:13:58] <BillCriswell> $('.someDiv').html('something')
[14:14:03] <tables> q1=foob&q2=arfo&q3=ofum
[14:14:05] <tables> and so on
[14:14:08] <tables> i need q request parameter
[14:14:09] <duch_lunch> .text('yourtext')
[14:14:14] <tables> i need a request parameter*
[14:14:18] <BillCriswell> .butt('yourbutt')
[14:14:21] <duch_lunch> tables why are you chunking like that?
[14:14:23] <tables> how can i do what i just said?
[14:14:35] <tables> cuz i want to send the whole html's contents to my server
[14:14:41] <BillCriswell> duch_lunch: Didn't think efficiently mattered for this task.
[14:14:49] <tables> it must be in 512 byte segments, but lets start with 4 byte segments right now
[14:15:00] <BillCriswell> Err
[14:15:01] <duch_kazatel> wtf.  either way use a post for that.
[14:15:03] <duch_kazatel> instead of a get.
[14:15:18] <duch_kazatel> if you really need to send that much data at once.
[14:15:51] <duch_kazatel> why you're sending the entire contents of the page screams that you're doing something really unusual, so at least to the posting in a normal way.
[14:16:05] <tables> yea, kinda unusual
[14:16:25] <duch_kazatel> why are you shipping all the contents of a page like that?
[14:16:40] <tables> so i can work with the contents on my server
[14:16:52] <duch_kazatel> but your server renders the html, soooo...
[14:17:05] <tables> i don't want to render it in jquery
[14:17:18] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[14:17:27] <duch_kazatel> are you trying to do something with ajax?
[14:17:31] <tables> yea
[14:17:37] <duch_kazatel> because you can render fragments server-side and then inject just those.
[14:17:48] <tables> that's what i'm trying to do
[14:18:00] <duch_kazatel> send a parameterized request to the server -> it responds with the small bit you need -> inject that small bit.
[14:18:12] <duch_kazatel> why you'd send the page contents to the server to do that is weird.
[14:18:34] <tables> can you just tell me how to split a variable into 4 byte chunks, and then i want a variable that looks like "q1=four&q2=four&q3=four&q4=four" and so on
[14:18:47] <BillCriswell> Oh boy.
[14:18:59] <tables> and put that variable in a <div id="blah">
[14:19:06] <tables> for proof
[14:19:14] <tables> i'll start there, i think i know what i'm doing
[14:19:17] <duch_kazatel> no, because i'll do that, you'll continue having problems, then when somebody else says "your entire setup is bunk" you'll say "yeah but i was given this code to do it this way"
[14:19:31] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: Stop giving him bad advice.
[14:19:42] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell "bad advice"?
[14:20:18] <BillCriswell> Sarcasm sucks on the internet.
[14:20:26] <duch_kazatel> hahahaha okay, thank you.
[14:20:45] <BillCriswell> tables: Are you taking some kind of test?
[14:20:55] <tables> test?
[14:20:57] <BillCriswell> I feel like your tasks at hand are very unusual?
[14:20:59] <tables> this isn't school work
[14:21:09] <duch_kazatel> tables your entire approach is fundamentally flawed.
[14:21:41] <tables> can you just tell me how to split a 'var myvar = asdfblahblahasdfasdf;' into 4 byte chunks, and then i want a variable that it looks like "q1=four&q2=four&q3=four&q4=four" and so on
[14:21:54] <tables> can you just tell me how to split a 'var myvar = asdfblahblahasdfasdf;' into 4 byte chunks, and then i want a variable that looks like "q1=four&q2=four&q3=four&q4=four" and so on
[14:22:01] <duch_kazatel> no.  because you';ll do that, run into some other bizarre problem, and be right back in here asking for more help.
[14:22:02] <BillCriswell> I told you already.
[14:22:09] <BillCriswell> "I am a super long string boop boop boop ye haw".match(/.{1,10}/g).map(function(n, i){ return 'var' + i + '=' + n }).join('&')
[14:22:17] <BillCriswell> replace 10 with 4
[14:22:29] <tables> can you just tell me how to split a 'var myvar = asdfblahblahasdfasdf;' into 4 byte chunks, and then i want a variable that looks like "q1=asdf&q2=blah&q3=blah&q4=asdf&q5=asdf"
[14:22:31] <duch_kazatel> use BillCriswell's proof of concept if you need something.
[14:22:32] <tables> ^
[14:22:41] <tables> thanks
[14:23:06] <tables> how do i make them look like an html POST parameter?
[14:23:12] <tables> parameters*
[14:23:18] <duch_kazatel> POST or GET?
[14:23:25] <tables> any is fine
[14:23:28] <tables> GET is fine
[14:23:37] <duch_kazatel> why are you splitting into 4 byte chunks like that anyway?
[14:23:52] <BillCriswell> Good luck! I'm out. Take it easy.
[14:23:56] <tables> i have a variable that's 5000+ and i'm gonna split them in 512 segments
[14:23:59] <tables> or maybe 500 segments
[14:24:10] <duch_kazatel> but why
[14:24:14] <duch_kazatel> why are you splitting it at all.
[14:24:20] <BillCriswell> I am so intrigued.
[14:24:20] <tables> thanks BillCriswell
[14:24:34] <duch_kazatel> what makes the segments meaningful?
[14:24:52] <tables> they're meaningful because i want to work with them at the server level
[14:25:06] <duch_kazatel> but why are you splitting them in the first place?
[14:25:15] <tables> "I am a super long string boop boop boop ye haw".match(/.{1,10}/g).map(function(n, i){ return 'var' + i + '=' + n }).join('&')                      <-- how do i print this to <div id="mydiv"> ?
[14:25:18] <tables> for starters
[14:25:27] <duch_kazatel> because the page is too big to ship via the URL?
[14:25:31] <tables> because the max parameter size is 512 on apache
[14:25:33] <tables> yea
[14:25:37] <duch_kazatel> ....
[14:25:44] <duch_kazatel> you really need to change you approach.
[14:25:48] <duch_kazatel> i figured that was the problem.
[14:25:52] <tables> else i would do ?myquery=morethan512long
[14:26:11] <duch_kazatel> a GET request is for getting data from the server.  a POST request is for sending.
[14:26:23] <tables> i'm getting datat from the server
[14:26:34] <tables> because the php will spit out data
[14:26:36] <duch_kazatel> no, you're trying to use the URL to send data so the server can do something with it.
[14:26:52] <tables> or i'll use GET just to send data
[14:26:55] <duch_kazatel> instead, you need to have a parameterized URL that contains actual params that request the appropriate data.
[14:26:57] <tables> lol, it doesn't matter i think
[14:27:01] <duch_kazatel> yes, it does.
[14:27:03] <tables> as long as php gets the GET
[14:27:24] <duch_kazatel> what, pray tell, are you working on?
[14:27:30] <duch_kazatel> what is the end result of this project?
[14:27:38] <tables> "I am a super long string boop boop boop ye haw".match(/.{1,10}/g).map(function(n, i){ return 'var' + i + '=' + n }).join('&')                      <-- how do i print this to <div id="mydiv"> ?
[14:27:44] <tables> that's all i wanna know
[14:27:49] <tables> can you show me in jsfiddle?
[14:27:49] <duch_kazatel> no.
[14:28:17] <duch_kazatel> go read the docs on .text()
[14:28:22] <tables> all i wanna do is send a webpage to my server
[14:28:24] <tables> that's all
[14:28:27] <tables> through jquery
[14:28:29] <duch_kazatel> right, which is a terrible idea.
[14:28:34] <tables> why?
[14:28:55] <duch_kazatel> because that's not how you do ajax.
[14:29:06] <duch_kazatel> it's a lot of overhead.
[14:29:08] <duch_kazatel> for no reason.
[14:29:16] <duch_kazatel> you're making the entire project harder than it needs to be.
[14:29:26] <tables> ok then maybe you can help me
[14:29:33] <tables> lemme think of the criteria
[14:29:38] <duch_kazatel> wtf
[14:29:54] <duch_kazatel> start with this - figure out how to output the html fragments you need without sending the entire page to the server.
[14:30:30] <tables> yea it takes alot of javascript or jquery knowledge
[14:30:32] <tables> which i don't know
[14:30:35] <tables> if i wanna do it that way
[14:30:40] <duch_kazatel> no, it doesn't.
[14:30:49] <tables> i'm basically trying to retrieve a json, then turn the data into checkboxes
[14:31:02] <tables> which the users can check, then post to the server if they check one
[14:31:09] <duch_kazatel> great - expose that JSON from an endpoint. start there.
[14:31:15] <duch_kazatel> get a url that outputs that JSON.
[14:31:31] <ledestin> I'm trying to click() an element on the page. when I do it from console, it works, but when I do it from the document ready function, it doesn't. any ideas?
[14:31:37] <tables> http://ws.spotify.com/search/1/track.json?q=foo
[14:31:41] <duch_kazatel> ledestin it's not ready when you'
[14:31:41] <tables> i want tracks only
[14:31:51] <duch_kazatel> *you're trying to run the click()?
[14:31:54] <tables> i want all the tracks in checkbox format, which i can post or get to the server
[14:32:14] <tables> but first, i need the user to submit "foo" through an <input>
[14:32:16] <duch_kazatel> $.ajax() - go read about that.
[14:32:20] <ledestin> duch_kazatel: so, there was another ready function in jquery, maybe I could use that
[14:32:21] <tables> :((((
[14:32:31] <duch_kazatel> tables you want all the benefit without any of the work.
[14:32:36] <tables> you know what, just tell me how to do this, i'll be happy
[14:32:42] <duch_kazatel> no.
[14:32:44] <tables> "I am a super long string boop boop boop ye haw".match(/.{1,10}/g).map(function(n, i){ return 'var' + i + '=' + n }).join('&')                      <-- how do i print this to <div id="mydiv"> ?
[14:32:46] <ledestin> duch_kazatel: I just forgot how it's called
[14:32:52] <duch_kazatel> ledestin have a fiddle.
[14:33:10] <duch_kazatel> tables, stop asking the same thing over and over like a child.  what you want to do is convoluted, painful, and bad.
[14:33:54] <tables> just help me, lol
[14:34:28] <duch_kazatel> http://api.jquery.com/text/
[14:35:10] <tables> can you show me on jsfiddle?  i'm new to jquery
[14:35:13] <tables> i'll probably learn faster that way
[14:35:22] <duch_kazatel> what in those docs do you not understand?
[14:35:24] <duch_kazatel> how about you try.
[14:36:34] <duch_kazatel> what do you think you'd do there?
[14:36:44] <tables> ok i think i got it
[14:36:50] <tables> i'll come back if i have problems
[14:36:51] <tables> thanks
[14:37:16] <duch_kazatel> you really should take the time to learn jquery.  you should also reconsider your entire approach.  what you want is easy.
[14:40:22] <Onionnion> try.jquery.com taught me everything I need to know
[14:40:42] <duch_kazatel> his problem is more fundamental than jquery.
[14:41:47] <Onionnion> js?
[14:42:00] <duch_kazatel> he wants to submit an entire page back to his server.
[14:42:43] <Onionnion> Whatever that means, I imagine that's not the right way to do it.
[14:43:07] <duch_kazatel> nope.  not at all.
[14:43:35] <duch_kazatel> i'm even actually writing the actual code to do what he wants right now.
[14:43:44] <Crucials> Did he want to call some json with $.ajax, and display some stuff based on that, and then send a $.post somewhere else?
[14:44:01] <duch_kazatel> Crucials it's all calling some JSON.
[14:44:03] <duch_kazatel> no posting needed.
[14:44:12] <duch_kazatel> he's trying to hit spotify's api.
[14:44:23] <Crucials> yes, then based on that get some user inputs
[14:44:27] <Crucials> then send those inputs to his server
[14:44:28] <Otineb> you gotta love duch_kazatel... he's like the shepherd of ##jquery
[14:44:46] <Crucials> so that would be by posting?
[14:45:00] <duch_kazatel> Crucials yeah, that doesn't involve a POST, though.  you can use a standard $.ajax() request, which is a get.
[14:45:06] <duch_kazatel> you're manipulating the URL you're requesting.
[14:45:09] <duch_kazatel> that's the difference.
[14:45:34] <Crucials> are you refering to the getting the json, or sending the data to the server?
[14:45:40] <duch_kazatel> getting the JSON.
[14:45:57] <Crucials> but to send the data to the server AFTER he gets the json?
[14:46:08] <duch_kazatel> the data he wanted to send was unnecessary.
[14:46:11] <Crucials> im asuming he wants to store some stuff in a table or something
[14:46:24] <Crucials> a database rather
[14:46:34] <duch_kazatel> he wanted to send data back to his box to manipulate some HTML and then send it back out to the browser.
[14:46:40] <Crucials> ah
[14:46:49] <duch_kazatel> instead of using jquery to do it.
[14:46:50] <Crucials> fair enough
[14:47:22] <Crucials> i was thinking there was a database involved
[14:47:25] <Crucials> which is why he wants to post
[14:47:47] <duch_kazatel> nope.
[14:51:18] <duch_kazatel> lol i just coded up the basic get request.
[14:58:50] <duch_kazatel> ffffff i hate coldfusion
[14:59:06] <duch_kazatel> with every fiber of my being.
[15:17:45] <jdestef1> why is .show() setting my element display to "block"?  its previous display was "inline-block". it should be restoring it to that.
[15:18:09] <jdestef1> (2.0.3)
[15:18:09] <duch_kazatel> jdestef1 because show() sets display to block.
[15:18:17] <duch_kazatel> that's how it works.
[15:19:29] <duch_kazatel> and actually, per http://api.jquery.com/show/ "The matched elements will be revealed immediately, with no animation. This is roughly equivalent to calling .css( "display", "block"), except that the display property is restored to whatever it was initially. If an element has a display value of inline, then is hidden and shown, it will once again be displayed inline."
[15:20:24] <duch_kazatel> so i was wrong!
[15:20:32] <jdestef1> imo .show() should be improved to essentially not do anything if the elements display is NOT "none".. would be easier to deal with
[15:21:01] <duch_kazatel> you're not hiding it first?
[15:21:09] <jdestef1> youre right tho.. im doing an unnecessary .show(), which is putting "block" on it, then its being hidden
[15:21:22] <duch_kazatel> i'd suggest using .css() if that's what you need.
[15:21:25] <duch_kazatel> or do a check.
[15:21:44] <tw2113> i prefer using classes for this type of thing
[15:21:45] <jdestef1> i have hides and shows in 100 places... would take me awhile to change them all
[15:22:16] <duch_kazatel> woah.  sounds like you could use some abstraction.
[15:22:25] <tw2113> toggleClass('hidden'); .hidden { display: none; }
[15:22:30] <jdestef1> arent hides and shows already abstrations? :)
[15:22:51] <duch_kazatel> i wouldn't to toggleclass in this case, and they are abstractions, but it sounds like you're doing a lot of extra heavy lifting for displaying thgings.
[15:23:19] <duch_kazatel> without seeing your code, something tells me your repeating work you don't need to.
[15:23:22] <jdestef1> what is "lighter" lifting than 1 line  of .hide() or .show() ?
[15:23:41] <duch_kazatel> i'd have to see your code, but something tells me you're repeating a lot of logic.
[15:23:48] <jdestef1> basically im rendering a toolbar set of buttons, if the button has enabled: false, then the button body gets a .hide()
[15:24:24] <duch_kazatel> okay - that sounds like a single function called on an iterator to modify each button.
[15:24:50] <jdestef1> im already iterating :)
[15:25:04] <duch_kazatel> why are you calling show a 100 times, then?
[15:25:08] <jdestef1> allbuttons.forEach( function(b) { if (b.enabled==false) b.body.hide(} )
[15:25:33] <jdestef1> im not calling it 100 times, what i mean was that in my entire project ive been relying on hide and show
[15:25:43] <jdestef1> and id have to refactor all those points
[15:25:44] <duch_kazatel> aaah, okay.
[15:25:55] <duch_kazatel> i'd start with what you've got now, but that's just me :)
[15:26:52] <duch_kazatel> connection might drop brb
[15:30:54] <jdestef1> looks like .fadeTo() is the culprit.. its adding display:block
[15:42:05] <jdestef1> so these hide and show events were pretty deep in the stack,  during contruction phases of buttons, which take place during a construction phase of the parent "control" they are a part of.  all of the construction was taking place in an element that wasnt appended to the DOM yet, so jquery didnt actually have an initial css "display" value to remember.    once i put the .appendTo() statement higher in the construction order, stuff started rendering as expe
[15:42:22] <Tomashe>  hey guys anyone is using "leaflet js"?
[15:58:17] <HowardwLo> anyone here familiar with wookmark? I'm trying to get the example api to work by serving my own json file, but its no dice.
[15:58:20] <HowardwLo> https://github.com/GBKS/Wookmark-jQuery/blob/master/example-api/index.html line 63
[15:59:08] <duch_lunch> HowardwLo you have a server setup?
[15:59:22] <duch_lunch> with your own file getting served?
[16:01:17] <HowardwLo> its localhost
[16:01:43] <HowardwLo> heres my view in python: https://dpaste.de/zivP
[16:01:44] <HowardwLo> duch_kazatel: ^
[16:01:59] <duch_kazatel> just on your hard drive?  or do you have a server?
[16:02:18] <HowardwLo> I'm serving it locally off my harddrive
[16:02:22] <duch_kazatel> and you can load that up just fine in a borwser?
[16:02:26] <duch_kazatel> like a website?
[16:02:27] <HowardwLo> yes
[16:02:33] <HowardwLo> if i go to the url, it shows up just fine
[16:02:35] <duch_kazatel> okay, then what's the issue.
[16:02:58] <HowardwLo> when i change line 63 on wookmark to use my localhost url, there are no images
[16:03:17] <HowardwLo> theres a disconnect between wookmark and the json dict I'm serving
[16:05:08] <duch_kazatel> so you need help understanding what the format should be?
[16:06:38] <duch_kazatel> sorry, i can't figure out what your problem is.  are you getting an error in the console?
[16:07:12] <HowardwLo> duch_kazatel: ok so when i use wookmark example-api with the wookmark url on line 63, it works perfectly
[16:07:22] <HowardwLo> when i go to the wookmark url on line 63, i see a dict
[16:07:27] <HowardwLo> i copied that dict, to serve locally
[16:07:32] <duch_kazatel> fyi there are no "dicts" in javascript.
[16:07:41] <HowardwLo> and changed line 63 to reflect the correct url
[16:07:49] <HowardwLo> how do i call it, json?
[16:07:59] <duch_kazatel> yes, it's JSON.  it's an object :)
[16:08:11] <HowardwLo> ok, pardon me. I copied the json to serve locally
[16:08:30] <HowardwLo> and put the url in line 63 , url is fine, the json object is correct
[16:08:32] <duch_kazatel> mmk.  have you watched in your console to see what's happening?
[16:08:41] <duch_kazatel> make sure the file actually gets served?
[16:08:41] <HowardwLo> how do i do that?
[16:08:47] <duch_kazatel> what browser are you in?
[16:08:51] <HowardwLo> chrome / mac
[16:09:15] <duch_kazatel> open developer tools.
[16:09:45] <HowardwLo> is that an app?
[16:09:59] <duch_kazatel> it's a part of chrome that's all ready installed.  try cmd + opt + j
[16:10:01] <HowardwLo> or you mean inspect element thing?
[16:10:03] <duch_kazatel> see if that opens them.
[16:10:07] <duch_kazatel> yes.
[16:10:11] <xqo> how do i make line 10 wait until line 6 and 2 are done sliding up? http://jsfiddle.net/4J2kK/
[16:10:11] <HowardwLo> ah ok yes
[16:10:17] <duch_kazatel> go to the "network" tab
[16:10:24] <xqo> when the animations are done, i want to load("irc");
[16:10:52] <HowardwLo> right there, i see
[16:10:57] <HowardwLo> a get that failed
[16:11:01] <HowardwLo> type pending
[16:11:07] <duch_kazatel> there you go.
[16:11:55] <HowardwLo> sorry I'm still an amateur, how do I debug from here?
[16:12:08] <duch_kazatel> you should probably use an actual webserver, but that means the get failed.
[16:12:24] <duch_kazatel> what error did it return?
[16:13:10] <HowardwLo> i don't see a column for error
[16:13:18] <HowardwLo> only name, method, type,  initiator
[16:13:23] <HowardwLo> size… etc
[16:13:26] <duch_kazatel> no "status"?
[16:13:44] <duch_kazatel> right-click the headings and tick "status" if not.
[16:13:52] <HowardwLo> ah status
[16:13:57] <HowardwLo> sorry, it says failed
[16:14:09] <duch_kazatel> what code?
[16:14:09] <duch_kazatel> 404?
[16:15:21] <HowardwLo> doesn't show a code
[16:15:49] <duch_kazatel> click on the file on the left-hand side, then click "headers".
[16:15:57] <duch_kazatel> there should be a "status code" in that window.
[16:17:38] <GoSox> YO
[16:18:02] <HowardwLo> i don't see a status code there
[16:18:09] <GoSox> so i'm trying to understand some functions, is .empty( ) functionally the same as .html("")
[16:18:24] <duch_kazatel> HowardwLo is your copy of chrome really out of date?
[16:19:10] <HowardwLo> duch_kazatel: nope, its up to dte
[16:19:11] <HowardwLo> date
[16:19:14] <duch_kazatel> GoSox http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5723789/whats-the-difference-between-jquery-fn-empty-and-jquery-fn-html
[16:19:35] <GoSox> wow that is EXACTLY what i want to know :D
[16:19:44] <duch_kazatel> HowardwLo i'm not on mac so i'm not sure if it's different than my machine.  i'd go google around and see some info
[16:19:57] <duch_kazatel> GoSox in short - use .empty()
[16:20:21] <HowardwLo> ok
[16:20:37] <duch_kazatel> HowardwLo but it means that your server setup isn't working for whatever reason.
[16:21:08] <HowardwLo> duch_kazatel: alright, atleast i can pinpoint the source
[16:21:11] <HowardwLo> thanks
[16:23:06] <xqo> how do you run a function when sliding animations are complete? I want to run the commented part once the sliding above has finished http://jsfiddle.net/4J2kK/1/
[16:23:50] <aFeijo> a client asked why when he clicks his subscribe Email field, it loads another (invalid) page... I didn't coded that site, no idea where to look lol. How can I find which events that <input> have? jquery 1.10
[16:23:54] <duch_kazatel> xqo there'll be a "success" callback.  you'll need to proxy both of those through something else to check to make sure that both are done.
[16:24:18] <duch_kazatel> aFeijo http://www.sprymedia.co.uk/article/visual+event
[16:24:32] <aFeijo> thanks duch_kazatel ... checking
[16:24:33] <duch_kazatel> aFeijo that's a bookmarklet that'll show you events bound in the document.
[16:24:42] <HowardwLo> duch_kazatel: ok, i got the server part figured out, its showing 200 code
[16:24:52] <duch_kazatel> HowardwLo so it's working now?
[16:24:58] <HowardwLo> duch_kazatel: no images :(
[16:25:03] <duch_kazatel> aFeijo you'll also have to do some searching in the codebase, but look for form submit events.
[16:25:15] <duch_kazatel> HowardwLo are you getting any errors in the console?
[16:25:42] <HowardwLo> syntax error, ah ok
[16:25:48] <HowardwLo> seems like i can debug on my own from here
[16:25:56] <duch_kazatel> that's the goal :)
[16:25:59] <HowardwLo> is JS debugging very console based?
[16:26:33] <duch_kazatel> it can be.  are you familiar with more traditional debuggers?
[16:26:56] <HowardwLo> no sir, don't even know what traditional debuggers are
[16:27:13] <duch_kazatel> setting breakpoints and stepping through functions?
[16:27:38] <aFeijo> duch_kazatel, that plugin detected that there is an jquery event around the text field, but it dont show me details, just [object Object]
[16:27:48] <aFeijo> btw, this problem happens on FF only
[16:28:02] <duch_kazatel> aFeijo are you familiar with the console?
[16:28:07] <aFeijo> yes
[16:28:12] <aFeijo> chrome and firebug
[16:28:15] <duch_kazatel> does it throw any other errors?
[16:28:18] <duch_kazatel> *any errors
[16:28:21] <HowardwLo> duch_kazatel: with alerts and stuff?
[16:28:26] <HowardwLo> duch_kazatel: i believe i do that
[16:28:48] <duch_kazatel> HowardwLo no - you can fully debug code by pausing its execution and step through it line by line
[16:29:02] <aFeijo> duch_kazatel, just one, not related I believe, from an ads.js stuff
[16:29:04] <duch_kazatel> i'd learn how to use the debugger.
[16:29:17] <duch_kazatel> and aFeijo you'll have to search through your codebase.
[16:29:32] <HowardwLo> duch_kazatel: how do i get started on traditional debugging?
[16:29:56] <duch_kazatel> https://developers.google.com/chrome-developer-tools/docs/javascript-debugging
[16:30:33] <duch_kazatel> there are many guides out there, so feel free to search good for one that makes sense to you.
[16:31:03] <GoSox> is there a command i can use to kill a script, for debugging purposes?
[16:31:22] <duch_kazatel> GoSox "kill a script"?
[16:31:27] <GoSox> halt execution
[16:31:38] <duch_kazatel> Yes - the debugger.
[16:31:48] <GoSox> is there a way i can do it WITHOUT the debugger
[16:31:53] <duch_kazatel> nope.
[16:31:55] <GoSox> i just want this script to stop, without having to comment it out
[16:31:58] <duch_kazatel> not that i know of.
[16:33:38] <HowardwLo> duch_kazatel: thanks for your help
[16:50:14] <paulvd> hello, i have a page where i have bxslider and jquery ui tabs running, whenever i enable bx slider, the tabs disappear, any idea why that is happening ?

[18:03:14] <aitiba> some here that used plupload can help me saying why up.getFIle(id) [the id is saved on database on fileadd] gets me "undefined"?
[18:03:48] <aitiba> i look on google and stack overflow but I dont get the answer
[18:15:54] <duch_kazatel> aitiba are you setting id anywhere
[18:17:24] <aitiba> duch_kazatel: waht do you mean with setting?
[18:17:39] <aitiba> I have on the li di the file id

[20:07:59] <jedimind> wow i jsut tested that on mobile after not using it for like a year
[20:08:06] <jedimind> that's impressively responsive on mobile
[20:12:09] <Onionnion> can anyone tell me how I can reset a drop-down menu back to its original selected item (<option selected>) http://jsfiddle.net/Windsock/5BWRL/6/
[20:19:13] <Onionnion> this is apparently a solution but I don't understand why it doesn't work with mine when I apply it http://jsfiddle.net/weg82/
[20:23:11] <grafi> it is jedimind
[20:23:12] <grafi> ._.
[20:23:15] <grafi> cool stuff
[20:23:18] <grafi> bookmarked :P
[20:46:39] <prometh> hi
[20:47:14] <prometh> if i have an event triggered on an element, and it bubbles up to its parent... how can i detect on the parent if that event exists?
[20:47:45] <grafi> oO
[20:47:55] <grafi> what does that mean?
[20:47:58] <prometh> it's hard to explain, but..
[20:48:21] <prometh> i trigger a "removing" event on an element... its callback pauses the event (jquery++ event.pause)
[20:48:44] <prometh> runs animations, etc... then event.resume()'s
[20:49:15] <prometh> meanwhile, during that animation time, the same event is triggered on a parent element
[20:49:30] <prometh> instead of triggering, i'd like to detect the existence of the child event, and just add a listener for the bubble
[20:49:44] <prometh> cuz if i trigger, i lose animation/etc... no point talking about that
[20:50:11] <prometh> ....
[20:50:23] <prometh> the solution i've come up wtih is to store references in an array... btu is there a simpler way?
[20:52:20] <prometh> grafi?
[20:52:37] <grafi> trying to wrap my head around what you are doing, sounds complicated
[20:52:43] <prometh> it is
[20:52:44] <grafi> but I have no alternative :P
[20:53:00] <prometh> i'm setting up automatic animation for an mvc framework
[20:53:10] <prometh> ok, thanks for reading, though
[20:54:16] <prometh> is there anything like $(element).listOfRunningEvents ?
[20:54:29] <prometh> or anything in native js ?
[20:54:45] <grafi> not that I know of
[20:54:53] <grafi> which doesnt mean anything
[20:56:41] <prometh> :)
[20:56:53] <coldhead> not that i know of either
[20:57:06] <coldhead> and i've been using jquery since 11am today
[20:57:31] <grafi> coldhead you fucker ^^
[20:57:39] <prometh> hehe, arrays it is then
[20:58:10] <prometh> i'm not doing it now though, it's midnight... i'll do it in 11 hours :)
[20:58:17] <grafi> what about having events not bubble?
[20:58:43] <prometh> they bubble fine.. but i need access to them externaly
[20:59:03] <prometh> i'll have to set data or something
[20:59:15] <prometh> store references somewhere and do searches
[20:59:52] <prometh> i just didn't wanna do that, haha... lazy
[21:00:08] <grafi> got disconnected for a second
[21:00:33] <grafi> anything after [05:59:16] <prometh> store references somewhere and do searches ?
[21:00:46] <prometh> "i just didn't wanna do that, haha... lazy"
[21:01:22] <grafi> so what you trigger some animation, pause
[21:01:22] <prometh> nothing major :)
[21:01:28] <grafi> what happens when you resume?
[21:01:49] <prometh> it's fine, but i'm setting up the parent element for "removing" as well
[21:01:59] <prometh> and instead of triggering, which ruins my animation, i need to listen to the bubbled event
[21:02:08] <prometh> so i need to check if it exists first
[21:02:12] <prometh> cuz if it doesn't, need to trigger
[21:02:28] <prometh> so, if there's no native way to detect that, or anything in jquery, i'll have to store my own references and search
[21:02:44] <grafi> so you are removing element after element up to the top?
[21:02:59] <prometh> hmm
[21:03:01] <prometh> up to the top?
[21:03:06] <prometh> oh
[21:03:06] <prometh> yes
[21:03:22] <prometh> but they don't all get removed
[21:03:28] <prometh> only ones scheduled for such
[21:03:32] <grafi> hm
[21:03:39] <prometh> which is determined by mustache/handlebars
[21:03:54] <grafi> maybe you already found the best solution then ^^
[21:03:57] <grafi> idk
[21:04:05] <prometh> hehe, yeah it's kinda messed up
[21:04:10] <prometh> it's the thing i intend to only write once
[21:05:02] <prometh> i'll write it tomorrow
[21:05:11] <prometh> thanks again for helping me dig in further
[21:07:26] <kristofe_> Hey, i'm trying to make an ajax request before sending the user to a 3rd party site
[21:07:29] <kristofe_> http://jsfiddle.net/5LQ83/
[21:07:57] <kristofe_> problem is with this code it's a loop -.-
[21:09:44] <grafi> its a loop wohoo
[21:29:44] <paulvd> hello, am trying to get the image height as the line height of the anchor in the right, http://jsfiddle.net/qCVyZ/

[21:39:01] <paulvd> ops thanks
[21:42:20] <eip56> Hello everyone. I have created an object with a property of status. When I make an ajax call I get the results with return fine and I try to use those results (boolean true or false) to set the property of status. The first time it does not set the property. The second time it does. Anyone give me some insight?
[21:48:07] <AliG1000> I have a problem that has been plaguing be for a couple of days.  I put it up here: http://jsfiddle.net/EWtW5/2/
[22:24:50] <eip56> AliG1000 first use console.log()
[22:24:57] <eip56> its better than alerting everything
[22:25:03] <eip56> it will also tell you what your getting back
[22:27:24] <AliG1000> OK - I will try that
[22:30:33] <Uhkis> AliG1000: try this? tableid = $(this).parent().attr('id');
[22:35:03] <AliG1000> I did use the console.log()  I'm a little more confused :)  I have been using Firebug.  I will try Uhkis's suggestion
[22:35:31] <eip56> Hes trying to get the row id tho
[22:35:36] <eip56> not the parent if i understood correctly
[22:36:56] <AliG1000> just looking at Uhkis's suggestion and, epi56, I think you are right - it won't get what I need
[22:37:27] <Uhkis> wait a minute, you already have the table as $(this) ?
[22:37:56] <AliG1000> I am trying to get the row, specifically the data-messageid (which is unique for each row)
[22:39:37] <AliG1000> so I thought that by putting the id of the table e.g. tableIdInbox in the following line it would do the trick:
[22:39:38] <AliG1000>  $('.inbox-content .view-message').live('click', '#tableIdInbox', function ()
[22:43:50] <eip56> Im trying something give me a minute
[22:44:07] <AliG1000> ok
[22:44:17] <Uhkis> AliG1000: are you using the same jquery version on your server as in jsfiddle?
[22:44:48] <Uhkis> it's kinda hard to help when the simple code works fine in jsfiddle :)
[22:45:27] <AliG1000> yes - currently 1.10.1
[22:45:51] <Uhkis> have you checked that the html is valid?
[22:45:56] <AliG1000> although I get the same problem in newer versions
[22:46:18] <Jacta> is there a way to get http://is.gd/z7FTJZ to work correct - when I choose a month and open again, it shows jan 2014 again - i want it to show correct month somehow
[22:47:07] <AliG1000> @Uhkis I don't think there are any HTML errors
[22:48:11] <AliG1000> but how can I tel if there are any HTML errors?  It all appears to display correctly
[22:48:49] <Uhkis> validator.w3.org for example
[22:48:51] <eip56> Ok AliG1000 I think i have it for you
[22:48:55] <eip56> so let me get this right
[22:49:05] <eip56> when a row is clicked you want to capture data-messageid
[22:49:10] <eip56> correct?
[22:49:12] <AliG1000> correct
[22:49:25] <eip56> Here you go bud
[22:49:26] <eip56> http://jsfiddle.net/EWtW5/11/
[22:49:40] <eip56> you can change console.log to alert if you like
[22:49:49] <eip56> but i strongly suggest you start using console.log
[22:49:53] <eip56> go to firebug
[22:49:55] <Uhkis> so that's exactly like the original non-working code? :D
[22:49:57] <eip56> click console
[22:50:16] <eip56> try it
[22:50:41] <eip56> might have to do a live
[22:50:45] <eip56> if you are adding the content
[22:50:51] <eip56> but if the content exists that will work
[22:51:02] <eip56> hard to see withoout the fullw orking code
[22:51:13] <Uhkis> doesnt work on second table
[22:52:20] <eip56> Thats becuase his id is different
[22:52:33] <eip56> he has data-sentmessageid adn data-messageid
[22:52:34] <Uhkis> oh, right
[22:53:26] <AliG1000> what should happen is that if I click on one row in the tableIDInbox table, it will load in that message into the Inbox section.  If I click on a row in the tableIDSent, it will load in that message from the Sent section
[22:53:41] <AliG1000> let me look at your fiddle
[22:56:07] <AliG1000> I updated your fiddle here to more or less replicate what I have got going on my own page:  http://jsfiddle.net/EWtW5/12/
[22:56:59] <AliG1000> Basically, when I click on any row of any table, both scripts are firing, when I actually just want one script to fire i.e. for the tableID that I clicked upon
[22:57:48] <AliG1000> is there any way of saying:  only recognise the 'tr' in the tableIDInbox?
[22:59:12] <eip56> doing the edit one moment plz
[23:00:00] <AliG1000> I think I've got it: http://jsfiddle.net/EWtW5/14/
[23:00:55] <eip56> just write an if statement
[23:01:01] <eip56> thats redundant code bro beans
[23:01:38] <AliG1000> true - but http://jsfiddle.net/EWtW5/14/ works.  I'll put that into my script to see if it still functions
[23:02:08] <eip56> Ok best of luck
[23:02:58] <Hilton> Hiya. Is there a shortcut to do something like $('.turtle').ninja(this.data['name'])? The only way I can make work is var elem = $('.turtle'); elem.ninja(elem.data['name']);
[23:04:38] <eip56> .ninja? never even seen that lol
[23:06:00] <shoky> Hilton: no shortcut
[23:06:23] <AliG1000> Hilton try mixing in .mutate() and .teenage().  That should do it :)
[23:07:03] <AliG1000> OK, so I put in the working code in JsFiddle into my page and it doesn't work - darn
[23:07:50] <AliG1000> stuck.  all of the other jquery on my page works - just this
[23:07:57] <AliG1000> fails
[23:08:04] <Hilton> AliG1000: .teenage() is called shortly before .ninja(), and .mutate() is called at the start of the code to make all the other changes possible. Otherwise .teenage() has little discernible effect on <.turtle>, and .ninja() does nothing.
[23:08:50] <shoky> o.O
[23:09:12] <Hilton> Thanks for the input, though.
[23:13:08] <Hilton> I did have a problem calling $('.turtle').each().shredder(); .. turned out that I needed to do it as a group, $('turtle').wrapAll('<div id="#team" />).shredder();
[23:14:26] <AliG1000> mind. blown. :)
[23:16:21] <Hilton> Of course, there was a major typo in that.
[23:19:27] <raj> my plugin gets executed on an element, which will have the class .makeMenu-container  ... however, if I'd like the plugin to do it's thing on any .makeMenu-container within .super-container (even on .makeMenu-containers that are added later), how can I achieve this?
[23:22:27] <raj> I guess, I want to use a delegated system in the plugin
[23:23:33] <raj> hmm, on second thought, this won't be possible
[23:26:18] <raj> alternatively, can I clone an element that had my plugin executed on it, and keep the same clickhandler on the clone [as was in the original]?
[23:26:42] <raj> ah
[23:26:44] <raj> there it is
