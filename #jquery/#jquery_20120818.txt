[02:45:42] <rgr> Whats the way of using jquery to construct the <a> here that then contains the html? ie replace the contents of editorhelppane with a newlyconstructed <a> containing the html text?
[02:45:45] <rgr> $('#editorhelppane > a').html(helptext);
[02:53:20] <sprak> hello guys.
[02:54:28] <sprak> i have a for-loop inside a function which does a lot of post request with callback. when ALL post requests are done, i'm to do a deferred.resolve(). is there a nice way to do that?
[02:55:56] <circlicious> NodeX: thanks :D
[02:57:40] <sprak> http://jsfiddle.net/eKX8w/ like this
[02:57:46] <sprak> is that a nice way or is there a nicer?
[03:06:06] <rgr> So folks. What would you recommend as the best free/open source javascript/jquery editor out there for Linux based systems? I'm an avid emacs user for years but its just not up to to it IMO.
[03:09:25] <sprak> rgr: i'm currently using VIM with http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2727
[03:10:08] <rgr> heh, thats guarenteed to start a fight ;) I use js-mode2 but its too slow on my netbook.
[03:10:48] <sprak> http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1839 is also unavoidable because vim doesn't have autoindent like emacs
[03:10:59] <sprak> well, it's dumb :D
[03:11:28] <rgr> emacs has all sorts of auto indent - damn complicated and configurable of course. But thats enuff vi/emacs .. you know how it'll end up :))
[03:11:35] <rgr> brb
[03:11:55] <sprak> i will be switching back to emacs when my courses start up with evil mode (vim bindings in emacs :D)
[03:59:37] <eigentor> Hm I am wondering why this does not work $('ul.list').children('li.has-track').not('.hide').last().css('background', 'none');
[04:00:11] <eigentor> I have an ul.list and want to choose the last li inside of it that has not the class hide
[04:04:59] <eigentor> ah I got it
[04:05:09] <eigentor> it only selects the last in the entire dom
[04:06:19] <dangerousdave> I have created my own jquery modal dialog, and am now trying to make it generic to use. I would like to call the same modal dialog function from every button that requires it, but different buttons make visible different snippets of code, and i am struggling how to come up with a general solution, any advice please?

[04:55:13] <LittleFool> Hi, what does the .match function return when it cant fint a match?
[04:59:00] <se1fi> LittleFool: null
[04:59:53] <LittleFool> thanks
[05:04:41] <LittleFool> i want .match to return null if a filename contains _down so i did .match(/^[^_]+$/) != NULL but it seems to never return null :/
[05:06:35] <se1fi> in the case you specified your regexp will return null for _down
[05:07:32] <LittleFool> hmm ive put that in an if() but the if never gets executed
[05:08:10] <se1fi> can you show this part of code?
[05:08:57] <LittleFool> http://jsfiddle.net/NYHPd/
[05:09:28] <LittleFool> if i remove the if the code works as it should
[05:15:43] <LittleFool> aw lol you have to write it in small letters -.-
[05:15:53] <se1fi> true, that what I thought
[05:16:09] <LittleFool> every language does that different lol
[05:35:25] <raj> How can i move <svg> custom data </svg> inside a div?
[06:09:47] <Misiur> Hello - http://jsfiddle.net/EGPkQ/ - how can I check if uniform is already applied and don't duplicate it?
[06:12:59] <sprak> Misiur: what happens if you run it several times?
[06:13:08] <Misiur> sprak: Push the button
[06:13:19] <Misiur> (err, link "yay")
[06:13:56] <sprak> Misiur: can't you structure your code to avoid this?
[06:17:01] <Misiur> sprak: Unfortunately - nope. I'm adding one feature to already built structure, and I kind of don't want to do unnecessary work. The callback is called on each ajax request
[06:17:27] <Misiur> I already have some kind of kludge, but I would rather use some semantic option
[06:42:54] <mikegolf> hi

[07:51:06] <glontu> i have a variable with the method's name
[07:51:12] <glontu> how can i call this method ?
[07:56:29] <AnonymousPrime> glontu never tried this myself: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3326078/jquery-call-function-from-a-string
[07:57:47] <glontu> yup ... found it ... thanks AnonymousPrime
[07:59:57] <AnonymousPrime> np
[08:57:31] <concorn> hello. i'm doing this horribly wrong http://pastie.org/4544714 what would be the right jquery way?
[09:03:16] <AnonymousPrime>  $('#mainContent').children().each(function () { //yr bg code });
[09:03:23] <AnonymousPrime> concorn
[09:08:51] <concorn> AnonymousPrime: i tried each() and children() separately and just did not think about  combining them; thanks!
[09:28:11] <dangerousdave> why does hidedialog get called when i click on a.dialog, i thought i was binding it to a click event? http://pastie.org/4544841
[09:29:50] <BinaryKitten> dangerousdave because the click code executes the hid
[09:29:52] <BinaryKitten> *hid
[09:29:54] <BinaryKitten> *hide
[09:31:04] <BinaryKitten> dangerousdave also, are you sure there are not going to be more than 1 item with #overlay and #close
[09:31:10] <dangerousdave> binarykitten: i don't understand i am clicking on a.dialog not #overlay or #close
[09:31:28] <dangerousdave> yes sure
[09:32:21] <BinaryKitten> HideDialog(dialog)
[09:32:31] <BinaryKitten> that hides the dialog
[09:32:45] <BinaryKitten> you're not passing the function to the $('#overlay').clikc
[09:32:56] <BinaryKitten> you're passing the result of calling the function
[09:33:03] <dangerousdave> binarykitten: yes, but why does execute? its bound to a click event that hasnt been clicked
[09:33:39] <dangerousdave> ah
[09:33:53] <dangerousdave> hmm
[09:34:17] <dangerousdave> binarykitten: i think i understand, any idea on how i fix it please?
[09:35:00] <BinaryKitten> dangerousdave http://pastie.org/4544905
[09:35:50] <Miika--> hello, what's the difference between $(window).height() and screen.height?
[09:41:22] <dangerousdave> binarykitten: awesome, thanks for your help!
[09:41:28] <shoky> Miika--: window is the viewport (the browser viewport or the iframe if you're in one), that changes when you resize for example..
[09:41:52] <shoky> Miika--: screen height is screen height, doesn't matter if you resize your browser or something
[09:42:35] <Miika--> shoky: screen is the device resolution?
[09:43:02] <shoky> yah
[09:43:54] <Miika--> ok, thanks a lot
[09:46:56] <nsanden> is there an easy way to tell jquery to look at my radiobutton to see if it has "checked=checked" and then fire the click event
[09:47:50] <phux> nsanden: attr()
[10:06:29] <nsanden> phux: thanks
[10:21:11] <concorn> how do i use .css() directly on an element while i'm adding it?, e.g. $('#someID').append('<p>foo</p>').css('color': 'red'); will change #someID (since it is the selector)
[10:26:24] <w00tner> hallo my friends
[10:26:34] <w00tner> w0000000000000000000000000t
[10:31:28] <se1fi> concorn: $('#someID').append('<p>bar</p>').find('p').css('color', 'red');
[10:31:30] <phux> concorn: splitting it is no option?
[10:32:06] <se1fi> concorn: make sure you use comma between arguments in .css()
[10:32:45] <se1fi> concorn: http://jsfiddle.net/gZTZt/
[10:35:55] <concorn> sorry about the missing commas; i should have asked: jquery does not provide access to the last element appended/the last element which was manipulated by itself, right? (since even the find() solution requires specifying 'p')
[10:36:22] <concorn> or maybe a stack of elements that have recently been manipulated
[10:38:41] <se1fi> I got ya, but I don't no the way you can do this
[10:38:51] <se1fi> don't know*
[10:39:55] <concorn> i could not find anything in the docs so far, but maybe someone thought: "There are ids anyway and since we are offering DOM manipulation..."
[10:40:38] <se1fi> you can still use a function in your append
[10:41:41] <concorn> oh, then 'this' is bound to the current element? i see, clever!
[10:41:57] <concorn> (or 'standard', however you may see it)
[10:52:52] <concorn> se1fi: ids turn out to be more reliable in my case
[10:53:26] <se1fi> concorn: http://jsfiddle.net/gZTZt/2/
[10:54:37] <jayant> hi i guys i need some help, i want to make a image scraper that scrapes images from various sites just want to know if i can use jquery for it and if so how? any head-start will be good.
[10:55:58] <concorn> jayant: 1) yes you can 2) do not do it; it is painfully slow
[10:56:50] <jayant> cocncorn: any suggestions on how i can accomplish it?
[10:57:59] <johnkpaul> jayant: https://github.com/mape/node-scraper
[10:58:00] <concorn> jayant: 1) spell my name right 2) $('img') would be a good start
[10:59:16] <jayant> concorn: sorry my bad, and thanks :)
[11:02:40] <devslash> has anyone here used jplayer ?
[11:16:10] <imsky> falalala
[11:19:07] <dangerousdave> could i get a code review please? http://pastie.org/4545489
[11:19:12] <Deviad> Hello everyone
[11:22:24] <imsky> hey Deviad
[11:35:56] <nsanden> for speed, should i provide more or less selector information. i assume more the better?
[11:35:59] <Deviad> Can anyone pls help me to figure out why the maps on mywebpage are filled partially, there is no zoom bar and the marker on load does not appear in the center? This is the code: http://pastebin.com/7aYwxcPC
[11:36:20] <Deviad> I'm using goMap for Google maps.
[11:52:18] <dangerousdave> could i get a code review please? http://pastie.org/4545489
[12:01:57] <se1fi> dangerousdave: do you receive any errors?
[12:02:49] <dangerousdave> se1fi: no errors :-)
[12:03:04] <se1fi> dangerousdave: something is not working?
[12:03:38] <Heaven_> se1fi: i think he just wants to know if he can improve his code or make it more simpler
[12:03:49] <dangerousdave> se1fi: its all working, I just have little jquery experience, and think my code could well be crap and inefficient
[12:04:05] <se1fi> okay
[12:04:07] <dangerousdave> what Heaven_ said
[12:04:15] <Heaven_> :)
[12:04:25] <Heaven_> dangerousdave: i am on the same page here :D
[12:04:40] <dangerousdave> ah good, another noob
[12:04:47] <Heaven_> hahaha ya
[12:05:24] <concorn> what is wrong with $(window).bind('scrollstart', function() { $('body').css('color', 'red') });?
[12:07:32] <dangerousdave> concorn: it doesn't work? am i right?
[12:07:49] <concorn> i'm not including the scrolling extension
[12:08:36] <concorn> jquery does not provide 'scrollstart' and 'srollstop' events by itself yet, right? and it can not distinguish scrolling up/down so far, correct?
[12:09:42] <se1fi> it has scroll() which can be everything what you want
[12:12:09] <se1fi> $(window).scroll(function() {$('body').css(//your css here)})
[12:14:22] <concorn> se1fi: yup, you are right, i just need ta toggle bool there
[12:15:32] <concorn> i read about the 'scrollstart'/'scrollstop' events and my common sense was knocked out
[12:18:13] <LordThumper> http://jsfiddle.net/cCF3E/
[12:18:24] <LordThumper> That is for Scroll Top and Bottom
[12:20:48] <concorn> LordThumper: 'scrollTop'/'scrollBottom' != 'scrollstart'/'scrollstop'
[12:23:18] <concorn> though this http://jsfiddle.net/dV85f/ is not exactly working fine either
[12:23:46] <Justus> hi, in jquery ui with tabs I want to add content, but I get an exception when I do $('div').appendTo('#tabpanel-1'), what am I doing wrong?
[12:24:05] <concorn> (aim is to change the background color only while scrolling, then switch back to the original color)
[12:27:45] <concorn> this solution looks a bit more reliable http://jsfiddle.net/yijiang/fGmbe/ though using the scrollstart/scrollstop extension is now less hassle
[12:30:24] <shoky> Justus: what do you expect that to do? why $('div') ?
[12:31:30] <Justus> I just expect it to add an empty div to #tabpanel-1 instead of this exception: "Node cannot be inserted... point in the hierarchy"
[12:31:30] <Justus> 	
[12:31:30] <Justus> name
[12:31:30] <Justus> 	
[12:31:30] <Justus> "HierarchyRequestError"
[12:31:45] <shoky> Justus: $('div') selects all divs in your document
[12:31:54] <shoky> remembeR?
[12:32:44] <Justus> argh
[12:32:51] <se1fi> concorn: you can trigger events with .mouseup() and keyup()
[12:32:53] <Justus> thanks, I didn't see it
[12:34:38] <concorn> se1fi: which does not solve the scrolling problem in general; users may scroll with the mouse/the keyboard; users may only be able to scroll in certain circumstances (other js catching key/mouse events for some actions); users may have rebound keys for scrolling; ...
[12:35:05] <concorn> se1fi: the time-based solution is much more reliable here
[12:35:16] <se1fi> yeah
[12:55:19] <jita> Is there a way to append some string to input's value ?
[12:59:13] <concorn> jita: concatenation, js provides '+' for that
[13:01:02] <shoky> jita: $('#someInput').val(function(i,val) { return val + someString });
[13:03:14] <concorn> what's the right way to scroll up? $(window).animate({'scrollTop': '-100px'}, 'slow'); ?
[13:11:54] <concorn> ?
[13:12:07] <clarle> jQuery doesn't set the X-Requested-With header on AJAX anymore, right?
[13:13:22] <shoky> concorn: $('html,body') usually works fine
[13:13:58] <clarle> *for cross-domain requests
[13:19:05] <concorn> ok, objective is to make the window scroll down if the mouse is in the second half (vertical) of the screen and up if it is in the first one (also vertical); this http://jsfiddle.net/JBbcL/ is not working yet
[13:20:04] <concorn> oh, set to include jquery + it may not actually work in the fiddle since it tries to get the mouse position relative to the window
[13:25:26] <shoky> uh, you're queuing new animations on every mousemove?
[13:25:48] <shoky> that's a lot of queued animations
[13:26:16] <concorn> should i add a main loop or something? or trigger events on, well, mousemoves?
[13:27:26] <concorn> oh, i see the main flaw; i only have to scroll when the mouse crosses the "sector" boundaries, not when it is *inside* a sector
[13:27:54] <shoky> depends what effect you're after exactly..
[13:28:23] <concorn> no, initial description was correct
[13:28:48] <concorn> scroll everytime that is, either up or down (do not question the validity of this design desition)
[13:28:54] <shoky> "make the window scroll down" is not exact enough
[13:29:08] <concorn> shoky: so? what is enough then?
[13:29:09] <shoky> scroll down how fast?: for how long?
[13:29:15] <shoky> etc.
[13:29:44] <concorn> constantly scroll up/down with a sane speed (speed is only a numeric value)
[13:35:20] <concorn> there is no other way besides .animate({'scrollTop': n}, speed), is there?
[13:36:59] <abjorn> imsky my brudda

[13:48:09] <Heather_> Can someone take a look at this and help me with the ajax request: http://pastebin.com/byM77WRC
[13:48:11] <concorn> shoky: exactly, i totally gave up too early
[13:48:36] * concorn combines "topology algorithm" + "adchemy" + "engineer"
[13:48:49] <Heather_> Line 6, 8 and 15 are prob. wrong.
[13:48:52] <shoky> oops got a mistake there with isBottom
[13:51:00] <concorn> shoky: yeah, but checking for top and bottom would allow "continous scrolling" in a different way: if mouse is at bottom continue scrolling at the top and vice versa (no real sense in that, though)
[13:53:02] <shoky> dont know what you mean, but that's probably what i meant by 'depends what effect you're after exactly'
[13:54:18] <concorn> yeah, that was not a planned feature, just an idea
[13:58:35] <concorn> shoky: thank you for working that out!
[14:14:04] <dangerousdave> is this "$(#lightbox);" called a selector?
[14:15:43] <dangerousdave> i mean $("#lightbox")
[14:17:20] <toothrot> dangerousdave, "#lightbox" is the `selector` which selects tje element with an id of lightbox
[14:17:35] <toothrot> (just like CSS)
[14:18:37] <dangerousdave> toothrot: so whats it called when wrapped with $()
[14:25:01] <shoky> dangerousdave: the return value of that is a jquery object/collection
[14:25:23] <dangerousdave> shoky: ta
[14:30:41] <concorn> is there a reliable way to get the content and append it directly to any arbitrary div (no iframes, but loading all guest-site specify js/css etc.)?
[14:31:01] <concorn> i think loading the js/css may screw up things...
[14:35:03] <_zoggy_> iframe?
[14:38:17] <concorn> well, get() does not allow to query pages outside of the current domain and requires a proxy or ajax...
[14:38:44] <concorn> (which makes totally sense)
[15:19:00] <knite> is there a best practices way to access a single element when you know that's what you're selecting? eg, anything with an id, like $('#my_id'). I find it a bit surprising that this returns an array. I'm currently accessing the element with $('#my_id')[0], but this seems a bit hacky...
[15:21:54] <shoky> knite: that's the way to access the first element that's wrapped in the jq object, yeah
[15:22:06] <shoky> *best way
[15:23:17] <knite> shoky: huh, I can understand why jQ wants $() to always return an array, but getting an array back when selecting an ID is weird!
[15:23:22] <shoky> knite: and it shouldn't surprise you, because $(selector) means find _all_ elements matching the selector
[15:23:47] <shoky> knite: it's not an array, it's a jquery object
[15:24:28] <shoky> knite: if you didn't want a jquery object, you could've just document.getElementById('my_id')
[15:24:44] <knite> shoky: that's a fair point.
[15:38:04] <amanda1918> how to make round borders on backgrounds
[15:40:55] <tw2113> set an image as a background and then add border-radius to the dom element the background is on?
[16:07:19] <wut> why do some $.ajax() calls return 500 Internal Server Error?
[16:09:23] <Multiply> wut, Possibly because it encountered a 500 error. Check your server logs.
[16:09:43] <wut> I'm doing that now, should I be looking at access.log? or errors.log?
[16:09:59] <wut> OH HAHA STUPID ME
[16:17:13] <tom____> hi, was wondering if you can use .post or .ajax to post to server a simplified http header with ideally just the data portion included
[16:17:31] <concorn> i want to insert an element at mouse position so that it is centered on the pointer; this http://jsfiddle.net/5asMJ/1/ is not working as intended; why is that?
[16:18:58] <concorn> is it possible that $(#mousePosition).width is not available at the point it is referenced? but that is not the computed value, so i can not see why it should not be available...
[16:20:34] <concorn> tom____: .ajaxSend() lets you execute a function before sending, so you could potentially truncate it yourself...
[16:21:44] <tom____> awesome concorn i will try it, working on your problem now
[16:21:56] <tom____> $(document).mousemove(function(e) {         mouseX = e.pageX;         mouseY = e.pageY;
[16:22:06] <tom____> maybe needs to be click?
[16:23:07] <concorn> tom____: does not solve the problem, but sure, monsieur
[16:24:10] <razzi> lol
[16:24:17] <razzi> he already said what the problem is
[16:24:47] <razzi> #mouseBox doesn't exist
[16:25:56] <concorn> razzi: i'm working on this right now, but doesn't the browser calculate it beforehand anyway?
[16:26:07] <WaterRatj> eum how do you use jquery-ui with the jquery noconlfict option? just the same as jquery?
[16:26:13] <tom____> concorn, I don't mess up your jsfiddle when i click update right?
[16:26:34] <concorn> tom____: use "fork"
[16:26:47] <tom____> sorry
[16:26:50] <tom____> i will
[16:26:55] <tom____> it says click now
[16:27:15] <concorn> (i updated it myself)
[16:27:21] <razzi> concorn, there's probably a pure js solution possible someway, but i would just put mousebox in html
[16:28:33] <concorn> razzi: yeah, but this is just a mockup, the final version should generate the element dependend on the context and populate it accordingly, so it has to be js-generated
[16:28:47] <concorn> did not mention this constraint so far, sorry
[16:28:59] <razzi> i suspected that much
[16:31:29] <concorn> just manipulating 'top' and 'left' afterwards does not solve it; so it is probably a different source of error
[16:46:36] <samholmes> How do I remove all elements in a selection after a specific index?
[16:47:25] <samholmes> I have a set of columns that are all siblings that I select. I want to remove those element from the dom after a specific index.
[16:47:40] <samholmes> Or after a specific element.
[16:48:53] <samholmes> [.column, .column, .column, .column, .column] --remove after .eq(2)--> [.column, .column, .column] Feel me?
[16:51:29] <jedimind> no, but if you buy me a drink, i could feeel you
[16:51:40] <samholmes> jedimind: lol
[16:51:47] <samholmes> nah, found .slice method, does the job
[17:04:19] <concorn> intermediate result: externalizing mouse position retrival was a bad idea; x centering is working, y centering is not; $('#someID').height is a function, just like $('#someID').width and thus has to be called() (you jquery freaks could/should have told me that! ;) ); 'width' and 'height' are relly not available during creation and have to be retrievedafterwards; http://jsfiddle.net/5asMJ/20/
[17:04:32] <concorn> feel free to solve the y positioning
[17:05:23] <concorn> maybe it is also not available at this stage, who knows
[17:06:54] <concorn> specifying a fixed width during element creation gives a weird result, too
[17:22:07] <concorn> ...seems to work with a wrapper div (not 100% accurately, though)
[17:22:19] <concorn> (...and...took hours to find out...)
[17:33:25] <DanTRUE> hello
[17:33:47] <tom____> concorn, looks pretty good. I thought I was on to something, but have a look at this for a laugh or maybe something useful. http://jsfiddle.net/HsA9b/8/
[17:34:25] <DanTRUE> Can I ask something?
[17:40:05] <concorn> tom____: yeah, at some point i had the idea that using .css('height') would be a clever idea and it was just by luck that i wrapped the p in a div, no real understanding
[17:40:12] <concorn> DaveIngram: no!
[17:40:32] <concorn> tom____: thanks for trying!
[17:50:52] <DanTRUE> ok thx anyway.. :(
[17:51:07] <binaryfus10nz> anyone know how to do a really light weight infinite carousel
[17:53:31] <Shadow> Hi, can anyone help with mootools, please.
[17:53:48] <concorn> binaryfus10nz: take a piece of paper, fold it 8 times, then cut it however you like (do not cut the folds!), unfold it, glue it so you have a ring, take another paper strip, cut it so it has the length of the rings diameter, glue it to the ring, glue a pen to the strip, spin the strip; have fun! (doesn't weight much, you can spin it infinetly)
[17:53:59] <concorn> Shadow: #jquery != #mootols
[17:54:03] <concorn> *mootools
[17:54:42] <binaryfus10nz> loll
[17:54:50] <binaryfus10nz> the prob is I have a custom pager
[17:55:01] <binaryfus10nz> I guess I can rig it to index then click next / prev
[17:55:07] <binaryfus10nz> http://sevenprotected.com/new/ click the icons...
[17:55:20] <binaryfus10nz> if u go to last one theres nothing to the right so I want it to loop
[17:56:29] <shoky> ?ask @ DanTRUE
[17:56:29] <bot-t> DanTRUE, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[17:59:04] <concorn> binaryfus10nz: maybe (note: maybe!) you can duplicate the image strip as soon as the rightmost/leftmost icon is clicked, then make the first/last image of this new strip the target of the next animation, then do the animation and remove the original image strip (note: maybe!)
[17:59:43] <concorn> binaryfus10nz: or take inspiration from here http://code.google.com/p/jquery-infinite-carousel/
[18:00:03] <binaryfus10nz> ya I found that one
[18:00:08] <binaryfus10nz> was going to try it out
[18:00:15] <binaryfus10nz> I like ur idea to clone the loop tho
[18:00:22] <binaryfus10nz> any tips on how to do that?
[18:00:24] <binaryfus10nz> .clone :?
[18:00:47] <binaryfus10nz> what do you think would be best overall for this type of anim
[18:01:08] <binaryfus10nz> good/cool design :?
[18:01:54] <concorn> deque
[18:03:30] <binaryfus10nz> im gonna try the infin loop bbl thx
[18:05:52] <concorn> depending on how many successors/precessors should be visible, i would specify n viewports, flush them, then pop n images it from the images deque, populate the viewports with it and push the flushed images to the end of the image deque (flushing is more efficient when just flushing n - m images at a time)
[18:06:04] <concorn> binaryfus10nz: similar to this solution http://code.google.com/p/jquery-infinite-carousel/source/browse/trunk/jquery.infinite-carousel.js
[18:09:12] <DanTRUE> it's ok i'll find solution in php my problem is array in jq..
[18:11:10] <DanTRUE> I get a multi-dimensional array from the database, however, I need to count how many of the members 'a' and how members 'b'
[18:11:36] <DanTRUE> but I guess it's easier in php
[18:12:24] <concorn> DanTRUE: sure, php makes life so much easier
[18:12:35] * concorn almost fainted
[18:12:37] <DanTRUE> ok thx :)
[18:13:46] <concorn> js: treasure full of gold <-> php: sewer full of filth
[18:13:51] <Deviad> I found finally what does not make goMap work properly with my code. It's an implementation of tabbed panels that I found on a book.
[18:13:56] <concorn> DanTRUE: you already chose, no way back!
[18:14:09] <Deviad> Can anyone pls help me to fix this glitch?
[18:14:55] <tw2113> Deviad, links and fiddles help
[18:14:59] <Deviad> http://pastebin.com/7aYwxcPC
[18:16:32] <Deviad> I lost like 4 hours trying different things and debugging the code and tabbed panels is what is not making goMap working properly.
[18:16:55] <Deviad> spent*
[18:17:51] <tom____> not sure is .ajaxSend will work for me, I really just wanted to know if it's possible to POST conent portion without all the other HTTP header stuff
[18:22:20] <concorn> tom____: sure, you can, but headers are meant to be sent by specification; the recipient has to disambiguate the information (in this case: extract the content portion) and he can do that *because* of all the header information; so what is your reason to do this?
[18:23:21] <tom____> In this case i'm just sending to a simple java server that reads the data into a string
[18:24:43] <concorn> tom____: then use a good http library that will let you extract it on the server site (Play has this built in)
[18:25:41] <concorn> tom____: you could also parse the header yourself and extract the portion you like (according to this list, for instance http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_header_fields)
[18:26:29] <tom____> thanks for the tips, but I thought I could solve the issue on client side and do alot less string processing on both ends.
[18:27:10] <concorn> tom____: see all the goodies in there? content-md5 - ah!, content-type - oh!, content-length - yeah!, content-encoding - great!, ...
[18:27:19] <tom____> not to mention about 905 less data transfer
[18:27:27] <tom____> *90%
[18:27:35] <concorn> tom____: that is not spec-conform then
[18:27:57] <tom____> just a private server
[18:28:15] <concorn> tom____: network latency is worse, i would bet that's the case in your situation, too
[18:28:45] <concorn> tom____: "just a private server" - so your hardware is probably even slower...
[18:29:12] <tom____> at this point its my macbook
[18:30:07] <concorn> no comments...
[18:35:49] <binaryfus10nz> concorn, :-)
[18:41:12] <binaryfus10nz> any suggestions on the best way to right this? http://collabedit.com/xu7jf
[18:41:28] <binaryfus10nz> and/or a recommended JS pastebin
[18:41:36] <binaryfus10nz> write* lol
[18:44:31] <concorn> binaryfus10nz: this is gplv2 http://code.google.com/p/jquery-infinite-carousel/ did you even try to include it?
[18:44:47] <binaryfus10nz> whats that gplv2?
[18:44:53] <binaryfus10nz> easiest thing ever and im lazy?
[18:47:50] <concorn> binaryfus10nz: just noticed: here the .key list items look... ugly.
[18:47:52] <concorn> http://sevenprotected.com/new/benefits/
[19:00:18] <binaryfus10nz> not sure what you mean concorn
[19:00:35] <tom____> does the browser format the request header, or jquery? I think i remeber hand typing that stuff back in the day, but not sure any more. Maybe i can extend jQuery to use a custom/non-standard  request header.
[19:07:12] <fork[you]> moin.
[19:28:30] <defaultro> hey folks, need some help on pastebin.com/UdQhQZAi
[19:28:56] <defaultro> that code works
[19:29:14] <defaultro> however, I would like to know what each line does. How does it open and retrieve the file?
[19:29:48] <tw2113> around line 7, do a console.log(html) and compare that result with the contents of log.html
[19:30:10] <defaultro> OK
[19:30:28] <tw2113> one way or another, chances are it reads the content of log.html
[19:31:30] <Deviad> Can anyone pls help me with my issue between tabbed panes and goMap?
[19:31:33] <defaultro> OK
[19:31:41] <Deviad> http://pastebin.com/7aYwxcPC
[19:32:32] <Deviad> When I use any kind of a tabbed panes, the map has some glitches: it isn't displayed on the whole length of the box leaving some grey space, the marker is outside of the window and I have to drag the map down to see it.
[19:32:51] <defaultro> tw2113, which part of the code retrieves the log.html?
[19:33:00] <Deviad> If I remove the tabbed panel functions, goMap works fine.
[19:33:01] <tw2113> the ajax request
[19:33:13] <defaultro> most likely it's an http call?
[19:33:45] <defaultro> i'll tail my web servers access_log
[19:34:06] <defaultro> yes, it does an http call :)
[19:34:57] <defaultro> the reason I asked is because I need to change the way this chat program stores the chat. It stores it in log.html. I changed it to storing to mysql and it's working. The last piece I need to work on is that code I posted
[19:46:35] <defaultro> i got it working. I made a new file called retrieveChat.php and removed log.html to this :)
[20:38:39] <binaryfus10nz> is there a clone plugin that would be good for 100% width where u need like 2-3 shown on each side
[20:41:21] <toothrot> uh, what?
[21:19:51] <fotoflo> hey all. Im working on a bookmarklet and I want to be able to access cookies from the bookmarklet's origin domain. Any ideas how to do this? document.cookie is giving me cookies from the domain I'm injecting into.
[21:25:11] <coldhead> fotoflo: you can't access those cookies anymore
[21:25:11] <b-ot> coldhead, you have one new message, say “read” to me when you wish to read it.
[21:25:25] <coldhead> installing it as a bookmarklet severs the connection with that domain
[21:25:49] <fotoflo> coldhead:  i am also having this conversation in #javascript...
[21:26:13] <coldhead> oh good
[21:26:15] <fotoflo> it seems like there are some options
[21:26:23] <fotoflo> if you are interested in following the conversation...
[21:26:37] <coldhead> i am not welcome in #javascript but good luck!
[21:26:43] <fotoflo> haha
[21:26:44] <fotoflo> ok
[21:27:27] <Eviltwin> Pretty sure you cannot without creating an iframe on the other origin
[21:27:36] <Eviltwin> At which point you won't be able to talk to it
[21:27:59] <fotoflo> Eviltwin: you can use message passing with the iframe
[21:28:50] <fotoflo> evaluating evercookie
[21:29:00] <Eviltwin> Yes but what you need either way is to have some HTML + JavaScript sitting on that domain
[21:29:04] <Eviltwin> That gets served into the iframe
[21:29:44] <coldhead> iframe solutions are no solution at all
[21:29:54] <coldhead> chamberlain's policy of appeasement was an iframe solution
[21:32:34] <fotoflo> I own domain A.    The user uses my bookmarklet on domain B and C-infinity.  I can store in localStorage if the user is only using on domain B, but if I want their login to A to be persistent across all domains…. the iframe solution will not work?
[21:33:25] <coldhead> Eviltwin: over to you :D
[21:33:49] <Eviltwin> If you own domain A and domain A is the authority then all this cookie or whatever info should be coming from domain A
[21:34:07] <Eviltwin> So you should have your bookmarklet create an iframe to a new page on domain A
[21:34:16] <Eviltwin> That communicates the current cookies back
[21:40:13] <EasyCo> Hey guys, given the following boilerplate(https://gist.github.com/3385071) how would you code/add your methods? I'm used to the default var methods = {} way.
[22:03:10] <danheberden> EasyCo: since you already have your own namespace, making them scoped to that seems sensible. e.g., var doSomethingCool = function(){}; var doSomethingElse = function(){}; Plugin....
[22:03:52] <danheberden> also, it looks like you're maybe doing a some of the work that the widget factory does
[22:04:16] <EasyCo> danheberden: I'm currently reading up on widget factory
[22:04:33] <danheberden> http://ajpiano.com/widgetfactory/ if you haven't looked at it
[22:04:41] <EasyCo> I'm completely new to plugins and I'm just trying to get started properly
[22:05:39] <danheberden> https://github.com/cowboy/grunt also has a jquery plugin scaffold
[22:05:59] <danheberden> so once you have grunt installed, you just `grunt init:jquery` and it makes the files with the boilerplate, tests, and build process
[22:06:02] <danheberden> pretty baller
[22:06:10] <EasyCo> That's pretty cool
[22:08:54] <EasyCo> the widget factory requires UI doesn't it?
[22:09:11] <danheberden> no, the rest of ui requires the widget factory
[22:09:15] <danheberden> it's _part_ of ui
[22:09:20] <danheberden> but you don't have to add all the other stuff
[22:09:55] <EasyCo> Yah but it's not included in plain ol' jQuery
[22:10:23] <EasyCo> You need to at least create jQuery UI instance with at least the widget factory and core.. right?
[22:10:24] <danheberden> of course it isn't
[22:10:50] <EasyCo> Haha, ok good. That's what I thought
[22:11:46] <danheberden> no, the widget factory is standalone
[22:11:49] <danheberden> $.widget
[22:12:21] <danheberden> it adds the ui style css classes to actual widgets, which is the point
[22:12:46] <danheberden> i mean, if it's more than you need you can just create the plugin all by yourself
[22:12:49] <danheberden> that's totally fine
[22:13:21] <EasyCo> danheberden: I think that's what's happening here, I'm getting ahead of myself
[22:13:52] <danheberden> here's an example of what i was talking about before
[22:14:09] <danheberden> make your private methods just scoped to your IIFE, and expose the $.fn.pluginname method
[22:14:18] <danheberden> https://github.com/danheberden/jquery-key/blob/master/src/jquery.key.js
[22:19:23] <Guest14819> hi
[22:22:29] <Guest14819> @selfi hi
[22:25:32] <EasyCo> danheberden: Gotcha, that helped!
[22:29:26] <EasyCo> danheberden: In the boilerplate I posted earlier, the options get merged($.extend) with the defaults in the class constructor. Therefore if you call your first function from within the $.fn.pluginname function you don't have access to the overwritten options
[22:31:17] <EasyCo> danheberden: So I understand I'd put my private methods within my IIFE but I'm unclear on where I'd put my initial function call which you'd typically put in the $.fn.pluginname function
[22:32:21] <danheberden> i guess i'm confused why you're initializing a new object like that anyway
[22:32:23] <danheberden> instead of just having methods
[22:32:31] <EasyCo> Exactly!
[22:32:34] <EasyCo> So am I :)
[22:32:35] <danheberden> like, it looks fancy, but it might be more clever than necessary
[22:32:46] <danheberden> i had the same thing with my easing plugin
[22:32:47] <EasyCo> I was just trying to understand that bloody boilerplate
[22:33:04] <danheberden> and, in the end, found it easier to just make strong, well architectured methods
[22:33:20] <EasyCo> It came from this guy: http://addyosmani.com/resources/essentialjsdesignpatterns/book/#jquerypluginpatterns
[22:33:37] <EasyCo> Which I stumbled upon while reading of jQuery plugins and the likes
[22:33:42] <danheberden> yeah, he's got all kinds of patterns and stuff written about
[22:33:47] <danheberden> like i said, it's clever
[22:33:52] <danheberden> but might not be 100% practical
[22:33:55] <EasyCo> but annoyingly so
[22:33:58] <danheberden> ya
[22:34:12] <danheberden> i used to be more like that - self minifying, tricks, etc
[22:34:22] <danheberden> it's so much better to be explicit and practical
[22:34:37] <danheberden> not just for you, but for anyone else that wants to submit a pull request or file an issue or help, ya know?
[22:35:08] <EasyCo> I'm with you. Sure it's cool but it lacks verbosity.
[22:35:32] <danheberden> yeah - what is it this plugin is going to do?
[22:35:50] <EasyCo> It's an availability calendar
[22:35:51] <danheberden> solve my drinking problem? remove the memories of my ex-wife?
[22:36:04] <danheberden> oh, like, will it be a "thing" in the DOM?
[22:36:08] <EasyCo> That's part of the future plan
[22:36:11] <danheberden> like a regular calendar, but better?
[22:36:26] <EasyCo> Haha yep
[22:36:29] <danheberden> that's a very agressive plugin
[22:36:42] <EasyCo> It's for a holiday rental booking site
[22:36:45] <danheberden> i would strongly recommend the widget factory for that
[22:36:50] <danheberden> to make it a "widget"
[22:37:19] <danheberden> which is basically a thing that has a DOM representation
[22:37:25] <EasyCo> Yah I think so as it'll need to be stateful whatever the f*ck that means.
[22:37:26] <danheberden> like a button, datepicker, calendar
[22:37:44] <danheberden> it means you need to be able to track parts of your application that affect the whole
[22:37:47] <danheberden> like, what week you're on
[22:37:50] <danheberden> what row is being viewed
[22:37:57] <danheberden> what happens when a user clicks
[22:38:02] <danheberden> do you have sub menus?
[22:38:07] <danheberden> dialogs for entering info?
[22:38:16] <EasyCo> no and no
[22:38:27] <danheberden> i'm asking those rhetorically ;)
[22:38:52] <danheberden> the point it, you need to track what your calendar is doing
[22:39:00] <danheberden> the state of it
[22:39:16] <EasyCo> I need a beer
[22:39:17] <danheberden> so widget factory will let you have an instance per dom element created
[22:39:29] <danheberden> i would probably help to look at some existing calendars
[22:39:46] <danheberden> to see how they did it
[22:39:47] <EasyCo> I built the calendar already but not in a plugin
[22:40:01] <danheberden> that's what i mean, just for the plugin part
[22:40:15] <EasyCo> I need to plugin'afy for flexibility sakes.
[22:40:18] <EasyCo> Yah that's another good idea
[22:40:26] <danheberden> well _create is gonna make your shit, and you got events
[22:40:34] <danheberden> so you can probably get that beer*n in you
[22:40:39] <danheberden> and get to it :)
[22:41:15] <EasyCo> It's already half way down
[22:41:30] <blueadept> so is it pretty safe to say on is not replacing live?
[22:41:39] <blueadept> i mean .on and .live
[22:41:45] <blueadept> not*now
[22:42:09] <EasyCo> blueadept: .on/.off are your friends
[22:42:16] <EasyCo> danheberden: Thanks for your help mate.
[22:42:16] <blueadept> cool
[22:43:33] <danheberden> EasyCo: no prob
[22:48:53] <guy> Anyone can recommend a javascript library to generate something like this? http://slowchop.com/pycallgraph/examples/0.2.0/regexp.png
[22:50:57] <danheberden> guy - jsPlumb?
[22:51:02] <danheberden> ?jsPlumb

[23:11:22] <se1fi> guy: not jquery at all, but still http://raphaeljs.com/
[23:17:04] <zapsoda> http://ashermccauley.com/test/    how do i get a image instead of the word loading? heres the function http://pastebin.com/BLYvvqvH

[23:27:44] <tw2113> http://www.cssjockey.com/web-design-tutorials/an-easy-way-to-create-loading-bar
[23:29:39] <zapsoda> tw2113, i would like to get mine working
[23:29:56] <tw2113> so don't copy/paste, but study how they did it
[23:30:11] <tw2113> google "loading bar jquery"
[23:30:19] <tw2113> or "progress bar"
[23:38:08] <Lindrian> hey
[23:38:22] <Lindrian> I am using the plugin "tipsy". Very basic tooltip snippet for jquery
[23:38:36] <Lindrian> however, for nested elements, it displays all the tooltips for all the nested the elements
[23:38:49] <zapsoda> tw2113, i see how they did it i sent you the right function i just want to know how i can add html to that rather then just text so add html then add the text
[23:38:53] <Lindrian> how can I make it only display a tooltip for the one actually hoovered?
[23:39:12] <tw2113> check where your code adds "loading" and you know?change it for an image tag
[23:39:12] <Lindrian> like <span>abc def <span>ghi</span> ijk lmno</span>
[23:39:20] <tw2113> re: zapsoda
[23:39:21] <tw2113> not Lindrian
[23:39:25] <Lindrian> if I hoover "ghi", ill get a popup for both. I dont want that.
[23:40:15] <zapsoda> tw2113, .text("Loading\n" + Math.ceil(percentage) + "%");
[23:40:21] <zapsoda> it wont take a htmll tag
[23:40:31] <tw2113> then find one that will?
[23:40:35] <tw2113> .html() perhaps?
[23:51:35] <zapsoda>  $(qLpercentage).html("<img src="somthingHere").text( Math.ceil(percentage) + "%");
[23:51:40] <zapsoda> tw2113, ^
[23:51:44] <zapsoda> ?
[23:51:50] <CodesStuff> check quotes
[23:51:52] <CodesStuff> :P
[23:52:04] <CodesStuff> and syntax
[23:52:43] <zapsoda>  $(qLpercentage).html(<img src="somthingHere" />).text( Math.ceil(percentage) + "%");
[23:52:51] <zapsoda> ?
