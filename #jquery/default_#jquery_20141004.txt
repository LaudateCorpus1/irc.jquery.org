[01:23:11] <Robdgreat> don't do that.
[01:59:38] <x-finite> http://pastebin.com/u3FEd4wZ, i am trying to add a class for <a> tags of videos links via jquery .. tried a couple of codes but none worked
[02:02:12] <x-finite> for instance $('#nav-col-wp').find('li:has(ul)').addClass('parent'); doesn't works
[02:05:33] <Sunzero> hi, how i can get json of a string like this "{'first': true, 'nextone':true}" ?
[02:10:42] <prawnosun> Can you attach a function to an element something like this? $foo.function(){};
[02:11:32] <arthurvr> nope, you can $foo['fun'] = function() {}
[02:12:24] <prawnosun> i want to bind and trigger straight away
[02:12:36] <prawnosun> in one line
[02:38:22] <shoky2> greetings to shoky
[03:03:17] <Sunzero_> hey, can someone tell me somthing about this problem ? http://pastebin.com/yujzRmUc
[03:12:12] <Shadda> Sunzero_ you mean you're just getting a string instead of the decoded json? add dataType: 'json'
[03:12:34] <Shadda> but your php script should preferably send a header
[03:12:42] <Shadda> content-type: application/json
[03:12:51] <Legie> Hi folks! I need little help. I made the easiest script for slide lists and it works only when i set up auto 1. I need to work with it by clicking on "next" "prev" withhout auto - is there any solution? http://jsfiddle.net/mLp7jz3w/1/
[03:13:53] <Sunzero_> Shadda thx
[03:22:15] <Sunzero_> Shadda hmm get the same result
[03:44:31] <Legie> Hi folks! I need little help. I made the easiest script for slide lists and it works only when i set up auto 1. I need to work with it by clicking on "next" "prev" withhout auto - is there any solution? http://jsfiddle.net/mLp7jz3w/1/
[04:11:13] <Legie> Hello again. I need little help. I made the easiest script for slide lists and it works only when i set up auto 1. I need to work with it by clicking on "next" "prev" withhout auto - is there any solution? http://jsfiddle.net/mLp7jz3w/1/
[05:08:08] <phx> in html5 what stuff should be used for text that's supposed to be copy-able, but not modify-able, with avoiding the copying of any structural thingies?
[05:08:48] <no_gravity> whats the jquey way of saying "get this url and give me the contents"? something like data=$.getStuff("http://xyz") ?
[05:09:22] <calamity> Assuming this is my jquery script: http://mysticpaste.com/private/dWHOHRRT6B?4 am I correct in assuming that the .php script is executed? Or do I need to execute it manually?
[05:10:07] <phx> no_gravity, those things are asynchron, and you are getting the results in a callback usually. check .ajax, or .get, or something alike
[05:10:15] <no_gravity> phx: i need it blocking
[05:10:32] <no_gravity> phx: dont see a way to make it blocking in .get() docu
[05:26:50] <_rgn> you can't make blocking http calls with jquery
[05:27:28] <_rgn> neither with the lower level XMLHttpRequest i believe
[05:29:22] <_rgn> i was wrong, you can say async false
[05:31:05] <Legie> Hello again. I need little help. I made the easiest script for slide lists and it works only when i set up auto 1. I need to work with it by clicking on "next" "prev" withhout auto - is there any solution? http://jsfiddle.net/mLp7jz3w/1/
[05:35:38] <no_gravity> _rgn: yeah, got it working now.
[05:39:13] <Jayflux> _rgn, async false is something mozilla are trying to remove, but yes its possible with the xhmlhttprequest object
[05:40:11] <no_gravity> Jayflux: "trying to remove"?
[05:41:54] <d0de> why does the ternary operator ?: return the "true" output when given any non-zero number?
[05:42:29] <d0de> or indeed any non-blank string
[05:42:49] <no_gravity> d0de: show the code
[05:43:15] <d0de> 1 ? "true" : "false";  returns true
[05:43:28] <d0de> 0 ? "true" : "false" //  returns false
[05:43:33] <x-finite> $( ".menu-item-has-children a" ).css( "font-color:red;" ); seems to be working fine but $( ".menu-item-has-children a" ).addClass( 'myClass' ); won't
[05:43:40] <d0de> "foo" ? "true" : "false" //  returns true
[05:43:48] <d0de> "" ? "true" : "false" //  returns false
[05:44:17] <_rgn> d0de: because that's how javascript works
[05:44:27] <d0de> but "foo" == true // returns false
[05:44:47] <d0de> can you recommend some reading to help me properly understand this?
[05:47:02] <_rgn> http://docs.nodejitsu.com/articles/javascript-conventions/what-are-truthy-and-falsy-values
[05:47:52] <d0de> _rgn, looks perfect, thanks!
[05:48:31] <_rgn> you can imagine it as Boolean("") ? true : false
[05:48:55] <_rgn> "foo" == true is not the same as Boolean("foo")
[05:53:10] <d0de> _rgn, I think I get it now. I guess I already knew that if (someString) {} would execute for non-blank values of someString. I just hadn't really thought about it and put it together
[05:54:03] <_rgn> that implicit boolean conversion bites you in the ass sometimes
[05:55:05] <_rgn> for example when you have integers 0-n as input and do if (myInt) to check if it's undefined or not, but it will not work as expected as 0 will be falsy as well
[05:55:10] <scrubfest> I have a header that I slide up and down, and it is persistent on all my pages. Could I make the slide effect persist across pages aswell? Aka if I slide it down in one page, then switch page it stays down
[05:55:41] <_rgn> so you have to check for myInt != null or myInt !== undefined
[05:55:56] <d0de> _rgn, I see
[06:54:03] <Khyugh> hi
[07:04:01] <krambiorix> anyone any idea on how i can validate belgian phone numbers?
[07:34:55] <thyphus> i need to .effect('slide') an element with position:absolute in a parent container from the complete left side of my browser
[08:04:11] <buffercallback> Hi guys, what is the right way to send JSON to server?
[08:04:33] <buffercallback> $.post(url, {"movies": JSON.stringify(movie_list)})
[08:06:29] <buffercallback> bump
[08:19:37] <calamity> http://mysticpaste.com/private/6eJ03onAGX?2 -- is there any obvious reason that this would be getting ignored by the browser?
[08:21:44] <decx> data:{ date: $(this).attr('id') }, 'this' isn't .day
[08:22:15] <decx> put var id = this.id; before you $.ajax
[08:25:24] <calamity> decx, like this: http://mysticpaste.com/private/BnEi1zqefs?5 ?
[08:28:37] <decx> maybe
[08:28:48] <decx> could be that it doesnt matter in data:
[08:31:22] <calamity> well still, it's easier to read now
[09:51:49] <greengriminal> Hey guys i have a basic problem. So i am trying to make some html tags be considered html_safe so i have: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/8a0e05821bf99caf8241
[09:52:18] <greengriminal> Inside the success callback it just does not seem to render the html and continues to render the tags
[10:06:57] <greengriminal> if i do $('h1').text('<b>test</b>').html() why does it give me back the raw html
[10:07:12] <greengriminal> its not being interpreted by the browser
[10:09:35] <shoky> greengriminal: it gives back escaped html, because .text causes it to be escaped
[10:09:48] <shoky> e.g.  &lt;b&gt;test&lt;/b&gt;
[10:10:08] <greengriminal> so what would be the correct way of doing this?
[10:10:15] <shoky> didn't understand what you're trying to do
[10:10:37] <greengriminal> i am trying to set some text in a html element
[10:10:44] <greengriminal> and i want it to not be escaped
[10:10:54] <shoky> do you want it to actually render bold?
[10:10:57] <mgpl> $('h1').html('<html here>') ?
[10:11:00] <shoky> then use .html
[10:11:03] <greengriminal> X_X
[10:12:32] <greengriminal> well don't i feel daft
[10:23:16] <ljdevs> hey, hoping I can get some help here. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26195105/issues-with-sticky-navigation-container-size-is-to-small
[10:27:26] <daynaskully> {Q} in a $.post("file.php", { vars: this }, function(data){ }, 'json') -- how can i get access to the "data" form the call back? if im trying to return that value toanother function
[10:32:51] <shoky> var obj = { vars: this }; $.post("file.php", obj, function(data){ ...obj... }, 'json')
[10:33:20] <shoky> unless you meant something else by "data"
[10:33:26] <shoky> daynaskully ^
[11:01:06] <sadtaco> jQuery BBQ seems to throw errors with the newest jQuery.  Is there something newer that does the same thing?
[11:03:15] <sadtaco> It's doing browser checks that's no longer supported
[11:11:14] <codetroll> Good evening folks... I have a form with two select boxes and buttons to move items between them. That part works fine.. But how can I capture the actual selected option values and send them to the back end with an ajax call ?? Code here : http://jsfiddle.net/ak263zf4/
[11:11:45] <codetroll> Basicly I want to update the backend db at the same time..
[11:17:05] <codetroll> It is not the actual ajax call I need help with.. just how to get the selected value(s) ;)
[11:22:48] <engammalsko> can someone explain/help me? I'm able to access the object but .html() method doesnt work. http://pastebin.com/gQxyQ9Y1
[11:28:43] <mgpl> engammalsko: its working for me
[11:29:26] <engammalsko> mgpl: hm ok. maybe it's different cuz its a chrome extension.
[12:33:44] <aton`> hi, i am having a weird problem. i am deploying my code to 2 different servers. i fetch a json file using $.ajax() supplying the header Accept: 'application/json'. now both servers return the file, but one returns mime-type "text/plain". thus, i dont get an object but a string. i tried putting JSON.parse() around it, but that wont work on the other server as i get an object.
[12:34:21] <aton`> i could code a workaround so that a php file returns the json data with a correct mimetype, but thats ugly
[12:41:04] <mdev> $(document.body).on('click', 'ul.menu li', function(event) {
[12:41:16] <mdev> that works but I want ul.menu li .blah
[12:41:27] <mdev> so to match the li that has the .blah class
[12:42:29] <mdev> any idea how to do that?
[12:45:23] <shoky> why not put the .blah there?
[12:46:06] <shoky> aton`: use dataType: 'json'
[12:46:22] <mdev> shoky huh?
[12:46:35] <shoky> mdev: guess i didn't understand what you want
[12:46:54] <mdev> I want to detect click on the class of the .li
[12:46:57] <mdev> li rather
[12:47:01] <mdev> nothing i've tried works
[12:47:10] <shoky> detect click on the class of the li? what?
[12:47:11] <mdev> ul.menu li .blah don't work
[12:47:15] <mdev> ul.menu li.blah
[12:47:22] <shoky> the <li> has class="blah" ?
[12:47:25] <mdev> yes
[12:47:29] <shoky> then li.blah should work
[12:47:38] <mdev> isn't :/
[12:47:44] <shoky> make a jsfiddle
[12:48:08] <mdev> code too complicated/big for that
[12:48:13] <mdev> i'll keep playing I gues
[12:49:04] <mdev> nevermind was html error that's why
[12:49:42] <shoky> next time make a jsfiddle ;p
[12:52:23] <aton`> shoky: where? in the ajax call?
[12:52:34] <mdev> jsfiddle wouldn't have helped
[12:52:35] <shoky> aton`: yes
[12:52:51] <shoky> mdev: it would have shown you that it works, e.g. http://jsfiddle.net/1x66yygp/
[12:52:54] <aton`> shoky: i fixed it now by adding the mimetype for all .json files in htaccess
[12:53:20] <mdev> why would if I care if it works on jsfiddle
[12:53:28] <mdev> it wasn't working for  me was the problem :p
[12:53:30] <shoky> because then you know that  li.blah is not the problem
[12:53:32] <shoky> duh :\
[12:53:54] <mdev> I like you shoky, you're funny
[13:25:47] <frank_o> Hi! Does anybody know how I can make Snap.js (mobile slide-in menu) work across multiple jQuery Mobile pages? http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/phpyf0ws/3/
[13:26:21] <frank_o> https://github.com/jakiestfu/Snap.js
[13:30:47] <frank_o> this whole new universe of multiple pages is really messing with my mind =/
[13:50:24] <d0de> I have a button that stops audio playing after X minutes, where X is inputted by the user. So, for example, you might click it, put "15" into the input and then the audio will stop playing after 15 minutes. What should the text of the button be? I have no idea what to call this command
[13:50:39] <d0de> The best I have is "timed stop", but i think that's rubbish
[13:52:35] <shoky> delayed stop?
[13:54:09] <d0de> I like that a bit better, thanks
[13:54:28] <d0de> I still feel it could sound more intuitive, but I don't know how
[13:57:21] <shoky> sleep mode :\
[14:04:12] <d0de> something something cache invalidation :(
[14:05:46] <shoky> lol
[14:10:24] <adv_> http://jsfiddle.net/s0az5mtL/ , i want to change maxFiles variable based on the data returned by the ajax call, how can i do this?
[14:19:49] <Arthurvr> Is bugs.jquery.com down?
[14:21:49] <brad> it is here
[16:52:07] <pragma-> it's probably buggy
[19:25:00] <ZorroT> if a user drags and drops an image into a contenteditable div, moz inserts it as an <img> with a data url, and adds resize handles. Is there a way to disable this behavior in the browser?
[19:26:40] <BillCriswell> ZorroT: Can you preventDefault() the drop event? I haven't messed around with it.
[19:27:08] <ZorroT> BillCriswell: the issue is appearing in the process of trying to implement dropzone
[19:27:22] <ZorroT> it works on the background, but something seems to be intercepting the event in the browser.
[19:27:32] <ZorroT> er, in the contenteditable div
[19:29:13] <BillCriswell> ZorroT: Not sure then.
[19:46:54] <aquaguy> Hello

[19:49:16] <Aikar> hi - i'm looking for advice on best system to use. I have an array of timestamps, and id like a slider to let user choose a range from the timestamps. JQUI Slider doesn't seem to work for this. I need something I can pass the specific step values to use. I'm looking to overlay a graph on it, show a user a graph of data and select a range to view details about that time frame

[20:39:59] <_r0m3> is there a web standard for user notes or instructional text? e.g. does it matter if i decide to put user instructions in red, bold or italic?
