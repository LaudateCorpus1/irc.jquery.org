[00:06:37] <Unopoo> oh, here: self.callback && self.callback();
[00:06:37] <Unopoo> what's its purpose?
[00:07:46] <Unopoo> never mind, I figured it out

[00:43:03] <jgl> <textarea>default text</textarea>; 3 buttons. btn A and B delete "default text" and put textA, textB, if A or B is pressed again, textX is deleted and textA/B is inserted. Btn C only deletes text. This works ok. But, if I manually edit text, only click on it, buttons do not work, even thought if I inspect DOM, changes made by buttons seems to be wo

[00:48:42] <skdsuraj> I am interested in contributing to jquery under GSOC
[00:49:11] <skdsuraj> Can anyone please guide me?
[01:08:38] <b0t> i need decode a outputtttt
[01:55:46] <Csibesz> hi
[01:55:54] <arthurvr> hi Csibesz!
[01:56:01] <Csibesz> how i can use function load(num){
[01:56:01] <Csibesz> $("#LoadMe").load(+num+'.html');
[01:56:11] <Csibesz> and replace +num+ with world from load
[01:56:20] <Csibesz> onclick="load(1);return false;">
[01:56:32] <Csibesz> this to replace load(teszt);
[01:56:49] <arthurvr> !paste
[01:56:49] <b-ot> arthurvr: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[01:57:12] <arthurvr> Csibesz: would you mind creating a jsfiddle/bin to explain what youâ€™re trying to do?
[01:57:46] <Csibesz> i never use jsfiddle
[01:57:55] <Csibesz> i want just this <a href="#" onclick="load(2);return false;">Link2</a>
[01:58:08] <Csibesz> replace (2) with world
[01:59:12] <Csibesz> and this is my function load(num){ $("#LoadMe").load(+world+'.html')
[01:59:25] <Csibesz> oh i find it:)))
[01:59:31] <arthurvr> Yeah normally that would work but I would like to see the real problem youâ€™re trying to solve. generally onlick attributes are not that best practice.
[01:59:49] <Csibesz> why?
[01:59:49] <arthurvr> but world would be undefined in that function.
[02:00:09] <Csibesz> i want to show link in my div
[02:00:15] <Csibesz> without embed or iframe
[02:00:42] <arthurvr> Csibesz: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6941483/onclick-vs-event-handler
[02:00:57] <arthurvr> `api on @ Csibesz
[02:00:57] <b-ot> Csibesz: .on(): Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[02:01:39] <Csibesz> i check that wich b-ot show me
[02:01:46] <Csibesz> but i didnt figure out
[02:02:37] <Csibesz> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6949638/load-into-div-using-jquery
[02:02:51] <Csibesz> this one i want to make wich have 1 points
[02:02:59] <Csibesz> but i want to replace number with worlds
[02:03:12] <Csibesz> 10 points
[02:07:07] <arthurvr> Csibesz: Iâ€™m not sure Iâ€™m getting you right. You mean you want to load world.html?
[02:07:38] <Csibesz> yes
[02:07:59] <Csibesz> <a href="#" onclick="load(blabla);return false;">
[02:08:16] <Csibesz> and to run blabla.html
[02:08:31] <Csibesz> function load(num){ $("#LoadMe").load(+world+'.html')
[02:08:52] <Csibesz> but i dono what i need to change on load(num) to read load(blabla)
[02:09:22] <arthurvr> Csibesz: I shall fiddle something
[02:12:31] <arthurvr> Csibesz: 5 minutes. in a phone call
[02:12:50] <smoke__> hey guys i have a select dropdown, when on change i want to .hide() the previous selected option, and .show() the selected option how do  i get the previous selected option?
[02:12:50] <Csibesz> http://jsfiddle.net/c1tfgnmm/
[02:12:56] <Csibesz> i made jsfiddle
[02:13:14] <smoke__> http://pastebin.com/Q37cjZc6
[02:13:25] <smoke__> i have this so far, im trying to debug it
[02:13:45] <smoke__> #chem_view_control is my select id
[02:13:49] <arthurvr> Csibesz: a better example would be http://jsbin.com/hevanimesi/1/
[02:14:12] <arthurvr> Csibesz: it does not work on the jsbin because the page does not exist, of course.
[02:15:27] <arthurvr> Csibesz: This is an example without onclick, which is def. better.
[02:15:43] <smoke__> .prev()?
[02:15:58] <Csibesz> lett me try
[02:15:59] <arthurvr> Csibesz: Also, this will fetch the actual page, not convert it into a number (which was what your `+` operator was doing)
[02:16:23] <arthurvr> Csibesz: I didnâ€™t include the automatic html extension for now. You can append it if you like.
[02:18:27] <Csibesz> its work but tis is not open in to div
[02:23:02] <arthurvr> Csibesz: what isnâ€™t? are you sure the blahblahblah page exists?
[02:23:11] <Csibesz> yes
[02:23:14] <arthurvr> Csibesz: remember now it searches for something without extension.
[02:23:14] <Csibesz> i made one
[02:23:24] <arthurvr> Csibesz: does the div exist
[02:23:41] <arthurvr> Csibesz: did you checked the console?
[02:24:00] <Csibesz> http://csibesz.go.ro:83/
[02:24:14] <Csibesz> the first link is with your script
[02:24:54] <arthurvr> of course that page wonâ€™t work. It still has the bad code in it. http://gyazo.com/333834566d674674592971a113dcb87f
[02:25:25] <arthurvr> Csibesz: check the debugger tools before complaining :) http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide1
[02:26:37] <jop008> If I have this $("#showexplanation").click(function (e) { must it be placed in document ready?
[02:27:07] <arthurvr> jop008: depends on the place your code is executed. Is it in the <head>
[02:27:36] <jop008> I have a lib function in the head
[02:27:50] <jop008> is that the proper way to capture click event?
[02:28:05] <jop008> $("#showexplanation").click(function (e) {  the event is not fired
[02:28:05] <arthurvr> jop008: yeah, but the code that attaches it, is that in the <head>? Or somewhere else?
[02:28:27] <jop008> in the head there is the include of lib.js
[02:29:04] <arthurvr> jop008: That does not answer my question? is that code in lib.js? Or is it in another <script>/file?
[02:29:24] <jop008> yes in lib.js
[02:29:39] <arthurvr> Then yes, you need a $(document).ready()
[02:34:54] <jop008> okay and can you have document ready somewhere else also?
[02:35:37] <arthurvr> jop008: You mean if you can have multiple handlers? Yes.
[02:36:09] <jop008> okay good2know
[02:36:24] <arthurvr> jop008: Sure! If you have any questions, youâ€™re welcome!
[02:36:28] <jop008> I mean some general code and some specific code on a page
[02:36:39] <jop008> every page has an explanation part
[02:36:49] <arthurvr> jop008: would perfectly work.
[02:36:56] <jop008> okay
[02:37:44] <arthurvr> jop008: for example http://jsbin.com/kubufefece/1/edit?html,js,console
[02:37:57] <arthurvr> perfectly works :)
[02:38:12] <jop008> I have created a table with approx 10 columns and filtering on 1400 rows it is slow do you have time to look at this?
[02:38:31] <arthurvr> jop008: I have a little of time. Could you create a fiddle?
[02:38:40] <arthurvr> !paste @ jop008
[02:38:40] <b-ot> jop008: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[02:38:58] <Csibesz> arthurvr i replace $('div').load(link); with $('#mydiv').load(link);
[02:39:02] <Csibesz> now its works:)
[02:39:06] <Csibesz> thanks!!!
[02:39:16] <jop008> I have htm code js code and json data
[02:39:24] <arthurvr> Csibesz: Yup. If you have multiple divs in the page that makes sense.
[02:39:33] <Csibesz> :)
[02:39:38] <Csibesz> thanks again:)
[02:40:11] <arthurvr> jop008: The best thing to do is to reduce the problem and dump it into a fiddle. That mostly explains the problem better then words :)
[02:41:25] <arthurvr> jop008: Are you doing the filtering server-side?
[02:57:09] <jop008> no filtering is client side
[02:57:37] <jop008> but maybe I can ask server again with data based on filter settings good tip
[02:57:39] <arthurvr> jop008: what code is responsible therefor? It might include performance problems.
[02:57:57] <jop008> I do a pastebin of the code
[03:01:09] <arthurvr> jop008: okay
[03:18:06] <jop008> http://pastebin.com/HFq9d53e
[03:18:25] <wa5ted> hey anyone
[03:18:27] <jop008> the slow jquery mobile table filter code
[03:18:34] <wa5ted> does anyone know that plugin
[03:18:39] <wa5ted> that does redact text
[03:18:43] <wa5ted> instead of lorem ipesum
[03:19:08] <arthurvr> wa5ted: https://github.com/marak/Faker.js/ you mean?
[03:19:27] <wa5ted> arthurvr: the text is redacted
[03:19:30] <wa5ted> its a plugin
[03:19:33] <wa5ted> sorry but that isnt it
[03:19:44] <wa5ted> arthurvr: its essentially blocks
[03:20:46] <wa5ted> nvm found it
[03:20:49] <arthurvr> jop008: first of all, why do you start loading everything on document.ready?
[03:20:49] <wa5ted> https://github.com/christiannaths/Redacted-Font
[03:21:20] <arthurvr> jop008: you can already kick the request and in document.ready you should just append the table.
[03:22:08] <jop008> okay but initial html load is fast enough
[03:22:20] <arthurvr> jop008: Nothing is fast enough :)
[03:22:30] <jop008> I am looking for a nice lengend css with a rounded border
[03:22:38] <jop008> legend fieldset
[03:23:26] <arthurvr> jop008: the code you gave me looks a little messy at all. Could you try to explain me exactly what youâ€™re trying to do, so I can fiddle a better example?
[03:23:36] <arthurvr> are you trying to perform a search on it or so?
[03:24:24] <jop008> it is simple the table has 2 top rows one with filter and one with text on filter activate the code of filtering is fired
[03:25:25] <arthurvr> A jsbin/fiddle would be much better to explain it. Then I would have an idea how the data looks like
[03:25:26] <arthurvr> !paste
[03:25:26] <b-ot> arthurvr: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[03:30:55] <gsoc-student> Hi!
[03:31:48] <jop008> I try to set a border on my legend fieldset with this $(".selector").controlgroup("option", "corners", true);
[03:31:50] <gsoc-student> I'd like to get started with one of jQuery's gsoc projects. Any team members over here that would like to help me get started?
[03:31:54] <jop008> no border shown
[03:32:22] <arthurvr> gsoc-student: I am. What project are you interested in?
[03:32:48] <jop008> I am using this <div data-role="controlgroup">                <legend>address</legend>
[03:32:53] <gsoc-student> learning centers
[03:33:11] <arthurvr> gsoc-student: good to hear! Can we head over to #jquery-content?
[03:41:27] <jop008> I can place a border on my controlgroup but I want the label of the fieldset in the border
[03:44:11] <jop008> my fiddle
[04:26:30] <JoshMo> can you connect the right time to fire an interval with the time checks ? can someone help me out. http://jsfiddle.net/vyt5y8mc/2/
[04:27:43] <JoshMo> in short each slide changes with the time but my interval is set to 5001 so they are not in sync so one or many of those time checks will skip turns
[04:28:23] <JoshMo> so if i'm not wrong i need to like have a turns check or something. any ideas ?
[04:35:36] <JoshMo> anyone online?
[04:35:47] <daveaway> is it supposed to slide?
[04:35:52] <arthurvr> Hey hello JoshMo!
[04:36:41] <daveaway> JoshMo:
[04:36:42] <daveaway> .
[04:39:31] <JoshMo> daveaway: on each time change just fadeIn the set image for that time
[04:40:00] <daveaway> using a switch and actually counting like that
[04:40:14] <daveaway> seems too much
[04:40:56] <daveaway> have a 10 second timer that increments a counter
[04:41:19] <daveaway> when that counter hits ten, slidecontent (count); count++;
[04:41:23] <sacho_> JoshMo, what are you trying to do?
[04:41:37] <daveaway> er slide++
[04:42:01] <daveaway> if you are incrementing anything you can use a loop you dont need to check like that
[04:42:18] <daveaway> also
[04:42:30] <daveaway> use time <20    time >=20
[04:42:39] <daveaway> if it's skipping things that's maybe where it's skipping
[04:44:01] <JoshMo> it's not that it's skipping more that it runs faster then the setInterval timer so thats why it looks like it.
[04:44:17] <sacho_> can you explain what you're trying to do..?
[04:44:51] <daveaway> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20639606/changing-pictures-every-5-seconds-using-jquery-in-php
[04:45:13] <daveaway> have a look at the top answer,, in the window.interval
[04:45:15] <JoshMo> sacho_: well in short fadeIn the right image for the right time check.
[04:45:42] <sacho_> try explaining it in long.
[04:47:43] <JoshMo> sacho_: it should sync with time(clock) and run each image on my if checks for the right time.
[04:47:57] <sacho_> why do you want it to synchronize with time?
[04:48:39] <JoshMo> so it runs in sync
[04:49:44] <daveaway> wait wait.. can we see it in 'action' ?
[04:50:05] <daveaway> i mean, the actual clock
[04:50:22] <daveaway> where is the clock clock, i'm assuming it's an actual clock?
[04:50:35] <JoshMo> http://jsfiddle.net/vyt5y8mc/2/
[04:50:54] <daveaway> i mean, why do you want it in sync with a clock, is there going to be some sort of clock on screen?
[04:51:13] <daveaway> have you tried loading the image underneath the current image
[04:51:36] <daveaway> ah it is
[04:51:42] <JoshMo> daveaway: i want it run on more then one computer and everyone is in the same time zone
[04:51:57] <JoshMo> so that the image hits each screen exact clock(time)
[04:52:00] <JoshMo> if that makes sense?
[04:52:52] <daveaway> does js go by computer clock or server clock
[04:52:58] <daveaway> it's the clients clock isnt it?
[04:53:13] <JoshMo> i believe so
[04:53:27] <daveaway> you understand that that is the first issue you may want to fix?
[04:54:46] <daveaway> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1638337/the-best-way-to-synchronize-client-side-javascript-clock-with-server-date
[04:55:48] <sacho_> JoshMo, "so it runs in sync" with what?
[04:55:52] <daveaway> increment the clcok inside of there
[04:55:59] <daveaway> i think he wants multiple users to see the same image at the same time
[04:56:16] <daveaway> er the image even
[05:18:35] <dn5> hi :-) how am I suppose to set multiple params to jquery plugin, inline?
[05:19:27] <dn5> $("div").plugin({param1: "option"}); <- for one param only
[05:21:49] <dn5> anyone?
[05:23:02] <arthurvr> dn5: so you want to have your options passed as an object?
[05:23:17] <dn5> arthurvr: yes
[05:23:30] <arthurvr> lemme fiddle something.
[05:24:07] <dn5> arthurvr: sure, thanks
[05:25:43] <arthurvr> dn5: you just mean like this? http://jsbin.com/darosuhayi/1/
[05:25:52] <arthurvr> I might be understanding you wrong
[05:27:12] <dn5> arthurvr: this is correct for options, but you missed me, I want to have it inline like: $("div").plugin({param1: "..."} {param2: "..."}); - unfoutnely this does not work perhaps because my syntax is not correct
[05:27:33] <arthurvr> dn5: yeah thatâ€™s incorrect systax
[05:27:46] <arthurvr> but let me fiddle
[05:28:27] <dn5> okay
[05:29:26] <arthurvr> dn5: you mean like this then? http://jsbin.com/darosuhayi/1/
[05:29:53] <arthurvr> all objects you pass as arguments are going to get squashed together, so you can use that
[05:30:25] <dn5> arthurvr: thank you, this is what I wanted
[05:30:33] <arthurvr> youâ€™re welcome
[05:30:59] <arthurvr> dn5: just before you copy-paste it, Array.prototype.forEach is IE8+, if that matters :)
[05:31:09] <arthurvr> you can just use good old for loop as well :)
[05:31:39] <dn5> arthurvr: I'm learning, no copy/paste here and not project dependent :P but good to know for compatibility issue
[05:31:50] <arthurvr> dn5: sure! :-)
[05:31:58] <arthurvr> `api jQuery.each @ dn5
[05:31:58] <b-ot> dn5: jQuery.each(): A generic iterator function, which can be used to seamlessly iterate over both objects and arrays. Arrays and array-like objects with a length property (such as a function's arguments object) are iterated by numeric index, from 0 to length-1.

[05:32:33] <dn5> Interesting
[05:32:33] <arthurvr> dn5: If you donâ€™t understand pieces of the code, feel free to ask.
[05:32:42] <dn5> let me read the documentation
[05:32:47] <dn5> I'll let you know if I stuck somewhere
[05:32:51] <arthurvr> sure

[07:11:47] <VectorX> hi how can i see what is submitted when a form submit, i got a return false so it doesnt go thru ?
[07:19:00] <sacho_> learn to use your browser's developer tools and watch network requests being made
[08:37:08] <robertd> Hi why isn't http://jsbin.com/pitikidomi/1/edit working?
[08:37:34] <arthurvr> because you didnâ€™t include jQuery lol :-)
[08:38:01] <robertd> yeah sensemaker
[08:49:42] <malcolm_> is the scrolling on this page a jquery plugin? http://www.indeeinteractive.com/
[08:55:24] <imacinto> malcolm_: I have no idea, they've minified their source code. Why?
[09:09:02] <cjohnson> whatever it is, it sucks
[09:09:24] <cjohnson> I just scrolled up and not only did it ignore my input (which is a surefire way to make me close a page) but it then did its fancy-scroll DOWN
[09:37:58] <malcolm_> How did this website accomplish its scroll functionality? http://www.indeeinteractive.com/
[09:51:14] <drej> malcolm_: badly.
[09:56:05] <malcolm_> @drej: how badly? I dont think it is possbile to do better than that...
[09:56:17] <drej> its so bad.
[09:56:28] <drej> there are much better implemetnations of that approach
[09:57:43] <flexpaint> this top left menu toggle http://www.podliberty.com/liberate/ is the way "contact" shows up normal?
[09:57:48] <drej> malcolm_: http://www.thepetedesign.com/demos/onepage_scroll_demo.html
[09:58:14] <drej> malcolm_: or http://alvarotrigo.com/fullPage/
[09:58:57] <flexpaint> also the way it comes in from the top left instead of straight left
[09:59:02] <flexpaint> something is wrong right?
[09:59:49] <malcolm_> @drej: what you just sent is exactly the same, is this where they got it from do you think?
[10:00:32] <drej> its not the same, they way the capture the scroll event is much better
[10:00:44] <drej> i didnt care to check, if you look at their source code you can likely find the plugin they're using
[10:01:57] <drej> but, you're right, its the same scrolling pane design pattern
[10:06:42] <malcolm_> @drej: How is it better at all it seems exactly the same isnt it?
[10:07:06] <drej> its, not.
[10:07:15] <drej> and it doesnt matter, do whatever you'd like
[10:07:21] <drej> have fun, i gave you what you needed
[10:35:02] <Nash303> Nash303  I've always wondered, when I include jquery and various plugins, does the ?ver=### have any effect on the scripts at all?  ie js/jquery/ui/slider.min.js?ver=1.11.2  vs just slider.min.js
[10:35:09] <Nash303> or is it just for caching?
[11:00:30] <tdignan> Is there a better way to reference a nearby element with a certain class than: $(".foo").parent().parent().parent().find('.classname')? I need to use classes because I want the code to be reusable twice on the same page & don't want to require ids.
[11:03:13] <tdignan> k, looks like parents() actually is what I want
[11:03:14] <tdignan> thanks
[11:33:44] <VectorX> hi how can i see what is submitted when a form submit, i got a return false so it doesnt go thru ? is there a way to capture the entire submission via jquery and dump it ?
[11:34:30] <arthurvr> VectorX: yes there is.
[11:34:47] <VectorX> arthurvr how do you do it
[11:35:11] <arthurvr> VectorX: In the event handler, grab all data from the form and do with it what youâ€™d like to do with it. What exactly would you like to do with the data?
[11:35:53] <arthurvr> VectorX: You can get all data in a <form> using serializeArray.
[11:35:54] <VectorX> i just want to console log it and see whats about to be sent
[11:36:02] <arthurvr> `api serializeArray @ VectorX
[11:36:02] <b-ot> VectorX: .serializeArray(): Encode a set of form elements as an array of names and values. http://api.jquery.com/serializeArray/
[11:36:33] <VectorX> ty
[11:36:45] <arthurvr> VectorX: youâ€™re welcome
[11:49:47] <dn5> why doesn't this work: http://jsfiddle.net/c4cdcf7s/
[11:57:59] <tw2113> dn5, my console says the function isn't defined
[11:58:41] <dn5> yet it is
[11:58:46] <dn5> but I manage to find another algo for that
[12:00:57] <xenaxon> how can I make a LIVE webcam stream in javascript/html/php
[12:00:58] <xenaxon> ?
[12:06:02] <arthurvr> dn5: Hey, youâ€™re still around?
[12:06:14] <dn5> arthurvr: yes
[12:06:29] <arthurvr> Well there are some problems with the snippet you posted.
[12:06:46] <dn5> arthurvr: I'm listening
[12:07:06] <arthurvr> First of all, youâ€™re having a scoping problem.
[12:07:33] <arthurvr> Youâ€™re defining your function inside the callback function for document#ready
[12:07:41] <arthurvr> Which means the function is only available there.
[12:07:57] <dn5> Ahm.. I understand that
[12:08:41] <dn5> Is there a problem because of combination of JS and jquery as fw?
[12:09:00] <Duvdevan> I'm looking for some serbians
[12:09:09] <arthurvr> dn5: Well now this still isnâ€™t working: http://jsfiddle.net/c4cdcf7s/1/. Thatâ€™s because you call the function in the pageâ€™s <body>, while you define the function later on.
[12:09:35] <arthurvr> You told jsfiddle to include the `js` code inside at the end of the body.
[12:09:58] <dn5> ahh.. yes, you are correct
[12:10:03] <arthurvr> The script tag in the `html` window is therefor executed before the function is defined.
[12:10:22] <arthurvr> dn5: this works, fyi: http://jsfiddle.net/c4cdcf7s/2/
[12:11:00] <Nash303> more like ftw, arthurvr
[12:11:08] <Nash303> case closed
[12:11:49] <arthurvr> dn5: Hope you understand everything? If youâ€™re wondering about the scoping, check https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9WKcsiADi4.
[12:12:15] <arthurvr> dn5: There are some great articles about this around the web, give it a quick google :)
[12:12:22] <arthurvr> Nash303: :-)
[12:12:57] <Nash303> scoping is tough in any language *sigh*
[12:13:17] <Nash303> can be*
[12:13:21] <arthurvr> Nash303: Ya but it isnâ€™t in every language as beautifull is as in javascript :)
[12:13:33] <arthurvr> I <3 javascript scoping :)
[12:13:36] <Nash303> that's very true
[12:13:56] <dn5> arthurvr: That was correct! Thank you!!! I rewrote the whole PHP function and back-end algo because of scope problem, it wasn't on my mind. The initial problem was because I called the function before genereting the textbox like this: http://jsfiddle.net/c4cdcf7s/3/ ; yet this works: http://jsfiddle.net/c4cdcf7s/4/
[12:14:09] <Nash303> I bought a template on themeforest and it came with a completely javascript version, so now I'm forcing myself to learn angular
[12:14:19] <Nash303> didn't even know half of it was possible
[12:14:47] <arthurvr> Nash303: Iâ€™m not an angular fan (anymore), but have fun!
[12:15:02] <Nash303> Mind if I ask why?  Just curious
[12:15:20] <arthurvr> Personal opinion. Thatâ€™s all.
[12:15:21] <Nash303> I'm doing it more as a learning exercise, nothing practical
[12:15:23] <Nash303> fair enough
[12:15:47] <arthurvr> For me it does just not feel right. Which, at the end, is the most important part of a framework.
[12:16:00] <arthurvr> ~one of the most important parts
[12:16:01] <Duvdevan> SERBIA !
[12:16:15] <Nash303> Jesus, you can say that again
[12:16:42] <Duvdevan> SERBIA STRONG!
[12:17:51] <Nash303> arthur, I have a quick question that I think I've already answered for myself, but I can't find anything to give me a definitive answer
[12:18:03] <arthurvr> Nash303: Feel free to ask.
[12:18:54] <arthurvr> Think I gotta run to a meeting. But still, feel free to ask. Somebody else will be able to answer I guess :)
[12:19:02] <Nash303> In my <script tags. my .js files are referenced with ?ver=XXXX in the path.  That's just so if I upgrade my jquery version, for example, it doesnt break through caching, correct?
[12:19:09] <Nash303> haha right on.  have a great day
[12:19:20] <arthurvr> No I have time to quickly answer that one.
[12:19:56] <Nash303> thank you
[12:20:32] <arthurvr> Nash303: Itâ€™s a best-practice called file revving. It makes sure that, when you release a new version of your app, the filename will â€˜changeâ€™ so the browser cache will break.
[12:20:52] <arthurvr> If you donâ€™t change that number, the cache will stay â€˜foreverâ€™
[12:20:58] <arthurvr> Which is a good thing.
[12:21:10] <Nash303> love it
[12:21:24] <Nash303> thank you!
[12:21:34] <arthurvr> Nash303: Sure! And the best thing is that, when you use the right tooling, you donâ€™t have to care about it yourself.
[12:21:51] <arthurvr> You shouldnâ€™t go change those filenames everywhere I mean.
[12:21:58] <Nash303> ie: Wordpress enqueue script?
[12:22:13] <arthurvr> I was more likely pointing to a grunt build script for example. https://github.com/yeoman/grunt-filerev
[12:22:24] <Nash303> gotcha!
[12:22:26] <arthurvr> But wordpress might be capable of doing something like that too.
[12:22:31] <Nash303> I think lazyloader does some implementation of that
[12:22:37] <arthurvr> Could be true.
[12:22:59] <Nash303> This channel is very insightful at times!  have a great rest of your day.  I'm gonna run too!
[12:23:24] <arthurvr> If you use the grunt plugin, for example, the cache of your users will refresh every time your files change. Awesome isnâ€™t it?
[12:23:32] <arthurvr> Nash303: bye. Youâ€™re welcome!
[12:24:22] <Duvdevan> worpress should die

[12:25:54] <arthurvr> haha
[12:26:00] <arthurvr> http://irc.jquery.org/irc-help/#giving-good-answers (check the example)
[12:26:16] <arthurvr> not a nitpick at you, Duvdevan, I just thought it was funny :)
[12:26:46] <arthurvr> Just saying but wordpress is awesome for some stuff.
[12:26:55] <arthurvr> All jQuery sites are powered by wordpress, btw.
[12:26:56] <Nash303> hahaha
[12:27:13] <Nash303> I was at a hackathon a few weeks ago and that was basically everyones attitude there
[12:27:23] <Nash303> "You use php?  Scrap it, rewrite in rails"
[12:27:27] <arthurvr> haha
[12:27:34] <Nash303> which I did, and it was actually good advice
[12:28:06] <Nash303> and my group won the hackathon despite using PHP, made a search engine dedicated to the life of Dwayne "The Rock'Johnson
[12:28:10] <arthurvr> No but really I hate the way some people write wordpress things. Just saying wordpress is awesome for other things :)
[12:28:22] <arthurvr> Nash303: haha, awesome!
[12:30:19] <GingerGeek> Im using JQuery ui and am creating a draggable. In the containment option can I use $(this)?
[12:30:41] <GingerGeek> optionLists.draggable({
[12:30:41] <GingerGeek>         containment: $(this).closest("div[data-student-panel]"),
[12:30:41] <GingerGeek>     });
[12:31:11] <GingerGeek> optionLists contain several nodes
[12:32:19] <Nash303> I believe so
[12:32:53] <GingerGeek> OK let me rephrase - it doesn't work
[12:33:01] <Nash303> $(this) is a selector, i believe
[12:33:01] <GingerGeek> containment isn't working as intended
[12:33:05] <GingerGeek> Yes it is
[12:33:13] <GingerGeek> bu this doesn't seem to work within initialisation
[12:35:41] <Nash303> hmm
[12:36:52] <Nash303> is it somethign you could get in a jsfiddle?
[12:37:09] <Nash303> or do you have a link?
[12:37:19] <GingerGeek> errr
[12:37:27] <GingerGeek> lemme  try and mock somethign up
[12:52:59] <GingerGeek> JSFiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/kgvs0uda/
[12:57:32] <GingerGeek> It doesn't seem to work as intendted
[13:44:28] <b0t> Anybody help me??¿
[13:44:43] <arthurvr> b0t: Whatâ€™s up?
[13:45:06] <b0t> I have codification problem
[13:45:16] <arthurvr> b0t: Where are you running into?
[13:45:19] <b0t> When y write a Ñ
[13:45:38] <b0t> In a input
[13:45:51] <b0t> Jquery convert my Ñ in utf-8
[13:46:20] <arthurvr> fiddle or jsbin would be nice?
[13:46:30] <b0t> Ñ = Ã±
[13:46:40] <arthurvr> !paste
[13:46:40] <b-ot> arthurvr: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[13:47:21] <b0t> It is a script that I found on the web , several files
[13:47:57] <arthurvr> Thatâ€™s exactly why Iâ€™m asking that. Please try to reduce the problem in a jsfiddle.
[13:48:30] <b0t> Https://github.com/philippK-de/jsIRC
[13:48:52] <arthurvr> Is that the codebase you mean?
[13:49:11] <b0t> Similar
[13:49:38] <b0t> One moment
[13:50:13] <arthurvr> Silimar :( We arenâ€™t going to debug a whole codebase for you, but are willing to look into a reduced testcase.
[13:50:14] <arthurvr> http://irc.jquery.org/irc-help/#asking-good-questions
[13:52:39] <b0t> Wait
[13:53:03] <b0t> Http://www.chatsi.net/java/
[13:53:06] <b0t> Here
[13:53:20] <b0t> Try it
[13:53:27] <b0t> arthurvr:::
[13:53:40] <arthurvr> b0t: well isnâ€™t that just the native behaviour?
[13:53:44] <arthurvr> You have this in your page:
[13:53:44] <arthurvr> <meta http-equiv="Content-type" content="text/html;charset=UTF-8" />
[13:53:49] <b0t> Yes
[13:53:51] <arthurvr> `charset=utf-8`
[13:54:04] <arthurvr> I think that basically forces it.
[13:54:37] <arthurvr> You will need to look into adding the `accept-charset` attribute
[13:54:58] <arthurvr> b0t: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLFormElement/acceptCharset
[13:55:26] <arthurvr> b0t: Will need to leave, but hope the above helps.
[13:56:17] <b0t> Is not html , you do not understand
[13:56:53] <arthurvr> b0t: That piece of html forces all forms on the page to use utf-8.
[13:57:04] <b0t> When I write in the input, the script sends the server the wrong encoding
[13:58:23] <b0t> I -> input -> script -> socket -> write -> server -> codification result
[13:58:54] <arthurvr> accept-encoding makes sure the right encoding is sent I believe. Anyways, really need to leave right now. Oh btw, you will need the accept-encoding anyways. It will cause more problems.
[13:59:18] <arthurvr> Also, this might not be jquery related.
[13:59:59] <b0t> Is javascript
[14:00:17] <arthurvr> yeah but not jquery related I guess.
[14:00:54] <b0t> I put this
[14:00:55] <b0t> <META http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1" />
[14:01:00] <b0t> I html and this:
[14:01:08] <b0t> Header("Content-Type: text/html;charset=ISO-8859-1");
[14:01:12] <b0t> In php but not work
[14:01:42] <arthurvr> As I said, a reduced testcase would help :) Anyways, I am afk
[14:01:59] <b0t> I do not know if may be the coding of js files?¿
[14:02:21] <arthurvr> thatâ€™s generally not related.
[14:02:31] <arthurvr> that should just be utf-8.
[14:02:38] <b0t> Thatâ€™s
[14:02:44] <b0t> You encode in utf8

[14:13:37] <weaksauce> I was messing with getJSON locally on my computer and was getting a cannot get data from that file. cross origin scripts are only allowed from http, data... etc.
[14:13:46] <weaksauce> is there a way to do a json request locally?
[14:44:48] <pushbyte> when using a deferred promise, if I use an anonymous function everything works fine (e.g., promise.then(function(arg1){â€¦) but if I use a named function, my arguments are undefined (e.g., promise.then(myFunction); )  Am I missing something?
[17:11:04] <CorySimmons> How do I make an event happen after another event? In this code I'm trying to wait until $('html').removeClass('.modal-active'); has been performed before adjusting the .modal's z-index, but it never seems to adjust the .modal's z-index. What am I doing wrong? http://pastie.org/10008373
[17:15:23] <CorySimmons> I figured out how to do it with setTimeout, but I'm still curious why the above code doesn't work.
[17:16:49] <CorySimmons> Basically, how do I make sure something doesn't happen until another action has been performed?
[18:12:15] <Torkable> how can I call the onclick function of an anchor

[22:32:45] <DreamStiffler> hi guys. As some of you would know im a noob in any coding. What I am trying to do is to get each data that i have, to fill in to each divs that I have created.
[22:41:56] <rn10950> Is anyone willing to detect a very simple issue that I just can't figure out? I am creating a script so when the mouse is depressed on an image, it will change but revert when the mouse is removed from the image. http://pastebin.com/W1qtUCCK
[22:45:08] <zejackal> if i load a page that is forwarding me to another page with a modal, what is a good way to handle closing the modal on the loaded page?
[22:53:08] <scribblemaniac> rn10950: For that behaviour you usually just want to chain the event binding functions together like this http://pastebin.com/hMVSFL3G
[22:57:11] <rn10950> scribblemaniac: thank you it worked
[22:57:31] <scribblemaniac> no problem
[23:04:39] <DreamStiffler> Hi guys...this is where i am stuck at. http://jsfiddle.net/eser3yaz/12/ Im trying to get the result to be in each div. The div cannot be in jquery. It must be already created. So i just need each one results to be in each div. As you can see there are 5 sets of results returned in "grab". I want these results to be separated and displayed in each div.
[23:06:27] <DreamStiffler> the problem now is all 5 results are displaying in each div.
[23:18:11] <DreamStiffler> Im looking at .ready . How do i use this to make sure the first script is run first before the second script. Meaning to make sure function 1 has finished loading before it executes 2nd function?
[23:27:07] <k3t4n11> hii Dream
[23:28:19] <k3t4n11> the second function should the callback
[23:31:44] <doug16k> DreamStiffler, there's a shorthand for "call this if and when ready", $(function() { ... })
[23:32:04] <doug16k> it runs that function right away if already ready, else runs it when ready
[23:32:59] <DreamStiffler> i tried it but it didnt work
[23:33:01] <doug16k> at top level, you might want:   jQuery(function($) { ... });    then you can use $ inside to refer to jquery
[23:33:11] <DreamStiffler> i mean it worked a litle but not as what i expected
[23:33:27] <arthurvr> Hi guys!
[23:34:35] <arthurvr> Iâ€™m just reading up. weaksauce: are you still having that problem with getJSON?
[23:35:15] <doug16k> DreamStiffler, oh I didnt see the fiddle, looking
[23:36:11] <DreamStiffler> doug16k: what im trying to do is, the YYY div is generated by another jquery. its a responsive slider. And i want data of this json to be inserted in each div.
[23:37:53] <DreamStiffler> But as you can see. The json (all 5) is inserted in each div. What i want to do is to insert each one to each div. I tried looking at arrays (to change the result into arrays and insert to each div) but my coding is bad and i couldnt understand and do it
[23:39:08] <DreamStiffler> So now im just trying around loading the script after the div is created. But wonders how.
[23:39:19] <DreamStiffler> Trying to find best solution if i can
[23:43:35] <doug16k> DreamStiffler, more like this for less security holes http://jsfiddle.net/eser3yaz/13/
[23:45:44] <doug16k> oops http://jsfiddle.net/eser3yaz/14/
[23:45:48] <doug16k> DreamStiffler, ^
[23:47:43] <doug16k> http://jsfiddle.net/eser3yaz/15/
[23:48:11] <doug16k> DreamStiffler, oh ok ,each one to each div
[23:48:37] <DreamStiffler> my result not coming out
[23:48:42] <doug16k> DreamStiffler, what you want to do then is, detach out a template from the dom, and clone off a clone for each row you create
[23:48:56] <doug16k> sec
[23:51:48] <doug16k> DreamStiffler, more like this http://jsfiddle.net/eser3yaz/16/
[23:52:48] <doug16k> DreamStiffler, is there actually a result coming back?
[23:53:01] <DreamStiffler> actually yes
[23:53:02] <doug16k> I assume fiddle ajax doesnt work
[23:53:05] <DreamStiffler> but i wonder why yours hasnt
[23:53:07] <doug16k> ok let me debug
[23:55:02] <doug16k> DreamStiffler, added error handler, look at console http://jsfiddle.net/eser3yaz/17/
[23:56:01] <DreamStiffler>  /**/yql_invalid_callback({"error":{"lang":"en-US","description":"Invalid JSON callback parameter yql_invalid_callback"}});
[23:56:30] <DreamStiffler> (anonymous function)
[23:56:35] <doug16k> I looked at request parameters. looks right. right right?
[23:57:25] <doug16k> I mean, those request parameters are what the source code said. I can't speak for the values
[23:58:28] <doug16k> DreamStiffler, is the request supposed to be json?
[23:58:48] <doug16k> request, response   <-- two different things that may or may not be json
[23:59:05] <DreamStiffler> may not be
[23:59:18] <DreamStiffler> i got it off the internet
[23:59:21] <DreamStiffler> using yahoo api
