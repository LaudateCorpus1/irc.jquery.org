[00:07:51] <arc_> you know how many there are
[00:08:04] <arc_> it's the first two of each one
[00:17:55] <SlizardWizard> arc_: except i don't

[05:02:14] <Cork> oh... lovely, ppl always love to know those things -_-'
[05:17:44] <mtnielsen> if I get a collection of items with var links = $("[target=editframe]"); then iterate over and change things with links[i].whatever = xyz, what is it I'm forgetting in terms of making things actually change on the page?
[05:25:20] <Cork> mtnielsen:  nothing
[05:25:42] <Cork> links is a jquery collection [] returns the raw dom element
[05:25:53] <Cork> modifying properties on a dom element modifies the dom so...
[05:30:56] <mtnielsen> hm then I'm doing something wrong apparently
[05:31:01] <mtnielsen> good stuff
[05:31:11] <Cork> make a jsfiddle
[05:41:21] <lng> hi guys! how may I loop through the rest of <tr> starting from current one returned by $(this).closest('tr')?
[05:42:08] <lng> can I get the positional key of a tr?
[05:44:12] <lng> solved
[05:53:00] <AdamPDotty> fine so far

[08:23:34] <harry01> hi everyone
[08:24:12] <harry01> quick question - I need to do something when a class is added to an input field
[08:24:17] <harry01> this is done by the DOM
[08:24:32] <harry01> but I don't think there is an event for this
[08:24:56] <harry01> and I don't have access to the source to trigger an event when the class is added, any suggestions?
[08:30:08] <FilipNortic_> feel like a backwards approch, can't you check for the class when you need it?
[08:32:46] <FilipNortic_> That said i recall hering about domchange listeners but i never use them so I can't speak to how good an id√©e it is
[08:33:00] <AdamPDotty> look for "mutation observers"
[08:35:22] <FilipNortic_> AdamPDotty: I remember someone telling me to avoid using those if I could but can't remeber why now. Are they reliable?
[08:36:16] <harry01> what about: DOMSubtreeModified
[08:37:40] <Cork> that one is deprecated
[08:37:41] <Cork> don't use it
[08:37:44] <AdamPDotty> there are more of these, but old
[08:37:55] <AdamPDotty> ah Cork really knows them *eg*
[08:38:36] <FilipNortic_> that would be a mutation listener
[08:38:44] <Cork> ya
[08:40:06] <harry01> DOMSubtreeModified works for me - using jquery 1.10.3
[08:40:14] <harry01> but I should consider another approach?
[08:44:19] <harry01> correction, using jquery 1.8.3
[08:46:15] <FilipNortic_> harry01: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/DOMSubtreeModified
[08:47:02] <FilipNortic_> guessing that's the reson it got depricated...
[08:47:39] <FilipNortic_> That also means the browser will start removing support for the event at some point
[08:52:03] <sonu_nk> hi
[08:53:15] <sonu_nk> http://pastebin.com/G5VBGB42 here my issue , i cant iterate array using $.each
[09:02:27] <lng> I have '<div class="a b c">foo</div>' and I know only one of the letters say 'b' - how can I serch for it?
[09:02:41] <Cork> Log1x: .b ?
[09:02:45] <Cork> opps
[09:02:48] <Cork> *lng
[09:03:21] <Cork> meaning $('.b')
[09:03:45] <lng> uh right
[09:03:47] <sonu_nk> hi , i am facing some critical issue with object and array .. can some one help me ?
[09:03:51] <lng> tnx
[09:04:01] <Cork> sonu_nk: not unless you ask the question
[09:04:14] <sonu_nk> http://pastebin.com/G5VBGB42 here my issue , i cant iterate array using $.each
[09:04:20] <sonu_nk> i asked before
[09:04:33] <sonu_nk> i can let you know my issue
[09:04:57] <hellyeah> sonu_nk:  you should fiddle it
[09:05:08] <Cork> or at least reduce the code dump
[09:05:15] <hellyeah> did you read the tutorial abour $.each
[09:05:17] <hellyeah> ?
[09:05:47] <hellyeah> https://api.jquery.com/each/
[09:06:03] <Cork> hellyeah: no that isn't the correct one
[09:06:08] <hellyeah> hmm
[09:06:12] <sonu_nk> hellyeah, https://jsfiddle.net/4ssscceo/
[09:06:13] <hellyeah> ops
[09:06:16] <Cork> https://api.jquery.com/jQuery.each/
[09:06:16] <sonu_nk> Cork, https://jsfiddle.net/4ssscceo/
[09:06:26] <hellyeah> http://api.jquery.com/jquery.each/
[09:06:30] <sonu_nk> i tried same i am much familer with this but this time i am fail
[09:06:33] <hellyeah> sorry this one
[09:06:55] <sillyslux> no need for such a fiddle
[09:07:03] <sillyslux> :(
[09:07:07] <sonu_nk> not iterating suing this $.each(booking.rides, function(key1, value1) {        });
[09:07:28] <sonu_nk> sillyslux, http://pastebin.com/G5VBGB42
[09:07:31] <sonu_nk> here pastebin
[09:07:35] <Cork> sonu_nk: why not just replace then(function(results) { iterateResultJson(results) } with .then(iterateResultJson ?
[09:07:35] <sonu_nk> see 125 line sillyslux
[09:07:40] <sillyslux> yeah i saw that
[09:07:43] <sillyslux> and that too
[09:07:45] <hellyeah> Parse is not defined
[09:08:02] <Cork> hellyeah: slow down
[09:08:07] <hellyeah> sorry
[09:08:08] <Cork> lets look at what he has first
[09:08:18] <sonu_nk> hellyeah, its working fine parse added but issue with only iteration .
[09:08:42] <Cork> sonu_nk: what is object?
[09:08:51] <Cork> or specifically why do you need to use .get() ?
[09:10:33] <Cork> hrmf @_@'
[09:10:39] <sillyslux> haha
[09:10:40] <Cork> sonu_nk: resultArrayForBooking is an object not an array
[09:10:49] <Cork> you're kinda mixing the terms a lot here...
[09:10:54] <sonu_nk> Cork, console.log(booking.rides); why its undefined ? when its having values
[09:11:27] <sillyslux> how can it have values when it's undeifned?
[09:11:31] <sonu_nk> ok Cork should i change var resultArrayForBooking = {}; with var resultArrayForBooking = []; ?
[09:11:34] <Cork> there we ko
[09:11:38] <Cork> *go
[09:11:53] <Cork> sonu_nk: cause resultArrayForBooking is an object so resultArrayForBooking.length == undefined
[09:12:01] <Cork> sonu_nk: that for one
[09:12:01] <hellyeah> {} is for object [] is for array
[09:12:08] <Cork> you should also use .push not [] = for the array
[09:12:26] <Cork> and push new values into the array instead of setting it explicitly
[09:13:07] <Cork> start with that; i have other things i have to look into; sorry
[09:15:29] <hellyeah> sonu_nk:  if it helps here is small example https://jsfiddle.net/n26xksxf/
[09:15:48] <sonu_nk> ok Cork how can i add .push() at 72 to further in rides array >?
[09:16:26] <Cork> sonu_nk: you create you either create a new array inside the loop and push that (if you never have to modify the inner array)
[09:17:03] <Cork> actually from what code you have there that looks like what you want to do
[09:17:24] <Cork> just expect to have a new array on each loop and build it from there
[09:17:41] <Cork> then at the end of the loop push the new array into the upper array
[09:18:12] <sillyslux> except, it's not a new array, but a new object
[09:18:43] <Cork> heh ya...
[09:41:30] <lng> How do I match an element knowing its part of id only?
[09:41:39] <lng> regex?
[09:50:38] <Cork> lng: don't
[09:50:44] <Cork> you can't match partially on an id
[09:50:55] <Cork> you can look for elements with attributes partials
[09:50:57] <Cork> but not id
[09:51:11] <Cork> and attribute selectors is a lot slower then id selectors
[09:51:37] <Cork> lng: if you need to match multiple elements that share parts, use classes
[09:51:46] <Cork> that is exactly what the classes are there for
[09:54:39] <mihalakev> hello
[09:54:44] <mihalakev> anybody here?
[09:58:24] <FilipNortic_> lots of people here but if anyone answers usally depends on the form and relevance of your questinon
[09:59:29] <Cork> meaning ask for help, not for someone
[09:59:35] <mihalakev> well, ok
[09:59:51] <mihalakev> how to run gridstack.js ?
[10:00:21] <mihalakev> i downloaded from github, but doesnt work..
[10:09:43] <FilipNortic_> mikebald: questions like that are almost impossible to answer from here either make a fiddle an show us how it's not working or try reading the docs of the plugin again
[10:10:29] <AdamPDotty> bald mike?
[10:13:51] <FilipNortic_> AdamPDotty: wow typed k instead of h thought you had some translation of mihalakev...
[10:14:01] <mihalakev> ok, thanky you, i sorry for disturbing
[10:14:13] <mihalakev> ok, thank you, i sorry for disturbing *

[10:18:18] <dglambert> yo
[12:25:01] <Kadigan_KSB> Hey. I'm using jQuery to do a global replace on all HTML contents (I need to replace /static/ and https://someotherdomain/static/ to https://somedomain/static/). It's working, but I was wondering if there was a better way to do that, like attaching to all objects (imgs, links etc.) and doing a swap on those?
[12:25:49] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[12:28:33] <Kadigan_KSB> robertmaxrees: I'm replacing all relative and absolute URLs that contain /static/, to absolute URLs to a different domain.
[12:28:52] <Kadigan_KSB> Right now I'm doing a global $j("body").html() replace. I was wondering if there was a better way of doing that.
[12:29:18] <duch_kazatel> woops.
[12:31:18] <robertmaxrees> Kadigan_KSB there a reason you can replace those on your server instead?
[12:32:13] <Kadigan_KSB> You mean can't, and yes - it's a huge CMS called Sitecore, the required resources are located on the final server but NOT on the development server
[12:32:26] <Kadigan_KSB> (website storage and website editing frontend are two separate servers)
[12:32:32] <robertmaxrees> weird.
[12:32:48] <Kadigan_KSB> and the company that's managing the CMS is quoting several hours $50/hr to fix this. :D
[12:33:04] <robertmaxrees> sounds like you'd want to change that so your templating system recognizing the environment and writes out the appropriate URL.
[12:33:13] <robertmaxrees> because doing this all client-side will cause all kinds of headaches.
[12:33:23] <Kadigan_KSB> The whole thing's written in ASP.NET :D
[12:33:30] <robertmaxrees> and?
[12:33:32] <Kadigan_KSB> And I don't have access to it anyway :D
[12:33:35] <robertmaxrees> .net's great.
[12:33:45] <Kadigan_KSB> ie. I don't have access to website logic,
[12:33:47] <Kadigan_KSB> only website content.
[12:33:52] <robertmaxrees> 'kay.
[12:34:00] <Kadigan_KSB> Hey, this is not the intended production,
[12:34:02] <robertmaxrees> you're going to break something probabky, but alright.
[12:34:12] <Kadigan_KSB> ie. when the website is up on the server, the /static/ folder is accessible.
[12:34:36] <Kadigan_KSB> Let me visualize: let's say the website is SomeWebsite, it will be accessible on http://somewebsite.tld/
[12:34:41] <robertmaxrees> lol
[12:34:43] <Kadigan_KSB> and /static/ is there.
[12:34:46] <robertmaxrees> i have a similar setup at my job.
[12:34:51] <Kadigan_KSB> The editor/preview, however,
[12:34:53] <robertmaxrees> i know exactly the problem you're having.
[12:35:05] <Kadigan_KSB> is at https://somewebsite.editsystem.tld/editor/shell/
[12:35:06] <Kadigan_KSB> :D
[12:35:13] <robertmaxrees> no reason to repeat yourself.
[12:36:04] <Kadigan_KSB> I was really just wondering if there was a better way of doing what I'm doing, just to learn something from this. I mean, the Q&D workaround already works, but I already knew how to do that.
[12:36:35] <SpecialTech> if ($(selector).length) Will this continuously check if the element exist or does it only run once?
[12:36:45] <robertmaxrees> your intentions are good, but the idea is going to break things and cause you bigger headaches down the road.
[12:36:52] <robertmaxrees> SpecialTech it'll only run when it's called.
[12:36:59] <robertmaxrees> so if you only check ones, it only runs once.
[12:37:36] <SpecialTech> How can I check until the element exist?
[12:37:56] <SpecialTech> I know I can use mutation observers with javascript, but I'm curious if that exists with jquery
[12:37:58] <Kadigan_KSB> robertmaxrees: it's only intended for my personal use (so that I can preview the websites as I'm porting them from our development server -- because the destination is hard enough to work with when they require IE 11 and I'm on Mac :D)
[12:38:04] <robertmaxrees> SpecialTech that's pretty unusual.  there are ways but they;'re exteremely slow and javascript only.
[12:38:24] <robertmaxrees> Kadigan_KSB heh 'kay.  make a fiddle and let's see what you've got.
[12:38:50] <robertmaxrees> SpecialTech *as in, non-jquery.  it sounds like you need to modify an event listener or something.
[12:39:06] <Kadigan_KSB> robertmaxrees: it's a simple $j("body").html( $j("body").html().replace(regex, replacement).replace(regex, replacement) );
[12:39:17] <Kadigan_KSB> I was wondering if I can do it better.
[12:39:19] <robertmaxrees> that's a terrible idea fwiw.
[12:39:25] <robertmaxrees> that'll break all your event bindings.
[12:39:32] <robertmaxrees> make a fiddle and we can step through some ideas.
[12:40:30] <SpecialTech> robert I'm pretty much trying to listen when react is done modifying the page, was trying to see if there was an obvious way to do so with jquery, but it all seems like it leads back to javascript which hasn't really worked well either :\
[12:41:15] <robertmaxrees> SpecialTech "when react is done modifying the page" something here smells.  why aren't you doing this with react when everything is done?
[12:42:17] <ExoUNX> so I have an onclick();.toggle
[12:42:27] <SpecialTech> I work more with the UX side of things, so I'm usually using tampermonkey to make modifications by injecting jquery/js to modify the page and send over to our devs.
[12:42:31] <ExoUNX> it's a small rectangle and when you click it expands the height
[12:42:34] <ExoUNX> of the box
[12:42:48] <hlve> SpecialTech, tampermonkey is fun
[12:42:50] <robertmaxrees> ExoUNX make a fiddle instead of describing it :)
[12:43:07] <hlve> i use it to make websites more usable.
[12:43:09] <robertmaxrees> SpecialTech there's not really much other than mutation observers and you have to be pretty careful with those.
[12:43:10] <hlve> :o)
[12:43:41] <taplar> SpecialTech: you don't have access to the repo?
[12:44:00] <robertmaxrees> i'll never really understand places that expect non-devs to write code like that but w/e
[12:44:03] <SpecialTech> I've been requesting access in order to create callbacks - but that's taken 3months so far...
[12:44:21] <taplar> i consider ux a dev role, :|
[12:44:28] <robertmaxrees> taplar not here :)
[12:44:38] <robertmaxrees> ui/ux are allowed to make PRs, but they generally don't.
[12:44:40] <robertmaxrees> they're designers.
[12:44:44] <SpecialTech> same, UX just cant be sitting behind photoshop anymore
[12:44:48] <robertmaxrees> lol
[12:44:57] <robertmaxrees> ux is far more than photoshop, but meh.
[12:45:05] <taplar> our uxers are design, but they are also js/angular writers
[12:45:15] <SpecialTech> I like to create experiences, not design them, so how else can I unless I dive into the frontend myself as well
[12:45:34] <robertmaxrees> sounds like you want to be a developer that also does ux then :)
[12:46:02] <SpecialTech> ;D
[12:46:12] <SpecialTech> I'm getting there.
[12:46:21] <robertmaxrees> either way, without mutation observers you're kind of SOL.
[12:46:31] <SpecialTech> Yea, I figured :\
[12:46:48] <SpecialTech> I was using setTimeout atm to just get the jquery done, but thats so bad lol.
[12:47:25] <taplar> iirc angular polls kinda like that if MOs are not available
[12:47:52] <robertmaxrees> his team's using react.
[12:48:06] <taplar> just referring the use of setTimeout
[12:48:18] <robertmaxrees> ah
[12:48:30] <robertmaxrees> sorry - new meds.  really knocking me out.
[12:51:58] <ExoUNX> robertmaxrees https://jsfiddle.net/he7wa68k/
[12:52:20] <robertmaxrees> oh - don;'t use onclick.
[12:52:25] <ExoUNX> robertmaxrees I'd like for the circle to cut off at the bottom of the initial box, then display the rest when clicked
[12:53:19] <robertmaxrees> what circle?
[12:54:33] <robertmaxrees> oh there's a gif there.
[12:54:35] <ExoUNX> robertmaxrees to the right
[12:55:32] <robertmaxrees> ah so you have a css questiuon.
[12:55:38] <ExoUNX> robertmaxrees this may help - https://jsfiddle.net/he7wa68k/4/
[12:55:50] <ExoUNX> robertmaxrees well I'm not sure if it's a mix
[12:56:13] <ExoUNX> robertmaxrees do I need to use jQuery for this, idk
[12:56:23] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/he7wa68k/5/
[12:56:27] <robertmaxrees> not functional.
[12:56:30] <robertmaxrees> but it's a CSS issue.
[12:56:35] <robertmaxrees> the jquery just adds/removes classes.
[13:19:45] <SpecialTech> robertmaxrees: actually setInterval works much better for what I'm trying to do, but I'm curious how can I stop the interval once the elements have been added.
[13:20:02] <robertmaxrees> use recursive timouts instead.
[13:20:17] <xebra> hi, everyone maybe seems to be "abusing" $(document).ready()... it's in every initialization code, etc. But do I really need to wait for the DOM to be ready if I place my jQuery code right after the HTML I need to manipulate? If I put it right after it, can I assume it's ready and just leave out the $(document).ready() wrapper?
[13:20:18] <robertmaxrees> check every x ms - if condition isn't set, fire again.  if it is, don't.
[13:20:36] <robertmaxrees> xebra yep.  you can.
[13:21:12] <taplar> xebra: make it a regular IIFE instead
[13:21:23] <robertmaxrees> ^
[13:22:55] <xebra> taplar, oh damn, yeah, that's a nice side effect of $(document).ready I guess
[13:23:33] <taplar> might be why it was done that way.  *shrug*
[13:23:35] <robertmaxrees> xebra also: people only abuse it inasmuch as they put more in there than they need to.
[13:24:44] <xebra> robertmaxrees, it seems to be it often causes unecessary "fouc" (flash of unstyled content), or stuff that appears all of a sudden and moves the rest of the content down, and other similarly annoying things
[13:25:07] <robertmaxrees> erm, you're still gonna get that.
[13:25:31] <robertmaxrees> the best way to fix that is to move as much server-side as possible, compress, minimize, etc.
[13:25:59] <taplar> have it styled how it should look on first render.  not change it after it has rendered
[13:26:21] <robertmaxrees> ^
[13:26:28] <robertmaxrees> that's a HUGE part of it.
[13:29:10] <xebra> robertmaxrees, if you apply the js/jquery right away, at least you won't have annoying things appearing above other things. Anyway, as taplar said, there are several ways to avoid crappy and annoying behaviors, but unfortunately it seems 99% of the internet doesn't care
[13:29:17] <xebra> anyway, thanks
[13:29:23] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[13:29:25] <robertmaxrees> i said that too lol
[13:29:27] <robertmaxrees> but okay.
[13:29:33] <robertmaxrees> (shrug) good luck.
[13:42:36] <hlve> hi robertmaxrees
[13:42:43] <hlve> you the real mvp

[13:43:31] <robertmaxrees> kay
[13:43:39] <hlve> jewlers?
[13:43:53] <hlve> EVERY KISS BEGINS WITH K.
[13:43:56] <robertmaxrees> heh.
[13:44:10] <hlve> taplar, thoughts?
[13:44:24] <taplar> as allways, very few
[13:46:53] <taplar> trying to get my new laptop up to speed
[13:47:00] <robertmaxrees> nice.

[13:47:12] <taplar> fk
[13:47:14] <robertmaxrees> hahahaha
[13:47:20] <taplar> as you can see, not used to the new keyboard
[13:47:26] <taplar> lenovo p50
[13:47:37] <hlve> time to wipe all the preloaded crap off of it
[13:47:38] <hlve> :P
[13:47:40] <robertmaxrees> oooh.
[13:47:41] <robertmaxrees> sexy
[13:47:49] <taplar> the in house guys do a good job of that
[13:47:53] <hlve> Lenovo is guilty of that.
[13:47:57] <hlve> <_<
[13:48:01] <taplar> they wipe them and then get them setup on the network and all that
[13:48:16] <robertmaxrees> as they should.
[13:48:18] <hlve> paint a racing stripe on it didn't get even a 'lol'
[13:48:23] <hlve> I thought it for sure would have
[13:48:25] <taplar> i just asked for a new battery and i get a new laptop, lol.  it was time though
[13:48:25] <hlve> :(
[13:48:45] <robertmaxrees> I had a similar experience hahahahaha
[13:49:03] <robertmaxrees> timing was perfect, too.  my hd started dying.
[13:49:36] <SpecialTech> robertmaxrees: https://jsfiddle.net/vp6sLkfp/1/
[13:49:39] <taplar> heh, we hated ours.  were still non ssds.  and the encryption they had on the boxes made start up super slow
[13:49:41] <SpecialTech> something like this?
[13:50:28] <robertmaxrees> basically.
[13:52:09] <taplar> ln 5 isn't necessary
[13:52:37] <robertmaxrees> oh yeah.
[13:52:43] <robertmaxrees> was that just because or...?
[13:54:10] <SpecialTech> Idk, I just wanted to make sure it doesn't run again
[13:54:11] <SpecialTech> !_!
[13:54:15] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:54:17] <robertmaxrees> no need to do that.
[13:55:03] <hlve> @_@
[14:03:06] <SpecialTech> robertmaxrees taplar hlve thanks for the support, you've made my day
[14:03:16] <robertmaxrees> deffo meng
[14:26:18] <elquestiono> hi there
[14:26:26] <robertmaxrees> hello
[14:26:38] <elquestiono> Just got a quick question, maybe someone can help me out
[14:27:24] <taplar> trump got elected.  anything is possible
[14:27:35] <taplar> think that's going to be my new saying
[14:27:40] <elquestiono> lol
[14:27:42] <robertmaxrees> haha
[14:27:59] <elquestiono> i feel you brah
[14:28:19] <taplar> i'm just a hater.  what's your q?
[14:28:39] <elquestiono> im from chile! i hope it doesnt get crazy up there now
[14:28:51] <robertmaxrees> lol
[14:28:56] <robertmaxrees> what's your question?
[14:29:02] <elquestiono> oh sure
[14:29:02] <elquestiono> haha
[14:30:11] <elquestiono> I'm trying to make a loop that increases a variable by 1, depending on how many time the number 6 fits in other variable. In plain english, if the variable box is 24 the variable item should be 4
[14:30:30] <robertmaxrees> you want to divide you mean?
[14:30:49] <taplar> Math.floor(x/6)
[14:30:53] <robertmaxrees> ^
[14:30:59] <robertmaxrees> not sure why you're looping for that :)
[14:31:04] <elquestiono> aha, sounds like that
[14:31:12] <robertmaxrees> and with that, lunch.
[14:31:13] <elquestiono> im not sure I expressed my self ok haha
[14:31:13] <robertmaxrees> bbiab
[14:31:46] <_genuser_> http://pastie.org/10963786       console logs Uncaught TypeError: frames.push is not a function()
[14:31:49] <elquestiono> im not quite sure how to express the if statement
[14:31:52] <elquestiono> sorry about the loop
[14:31:55] <_genuser_> am I doing something really dumb here? it works sometimes..
[14:33:02] <taplar> _genuser_: seems fine to me
[14:33:11] <taplar> console.log the frames before you do the push to see what it is
[14:33:32] <_genuser_> taplar: alright, let me try it.
[14:33:54] <elquestiono> http://pastie.org/10963789 better explanation :)
[14:34:16] <taplar> '=' is assignment.  '===' is comparison
[14:34:30] <elquestiono> I meant *two in the pastie, no to :(
[14:35:27] <taplar> hold on.  are the '.element' your items?
[14:35:51] <elquestiono> yup
[14:36:02] <taplar> so if you have 12 items...
[14:36:14] <elquestiono> that'll be 2 boxes
[14:36:22] <taplar> but, what does that mean?
[14:36:31] <taplar> are you wanting to put the items in a box?
[14:36:41] <taplar> and what is a box?
[14:36:45] <elquestiono> oh im trying to do some visual stuff for a store
[14:36:55] <elquestiono> like if you buy 6 beers, you have a pack of beers
[14:37:10] <_genuser_> taplar: frames is not null and target is not null either.
[14:37:19] <elquestiono> so im building it up on the front end, cause the backend for the store they use only has liquid templating system
[14:37:28] <taplar> lol, but what is 'it'?
[14:37:51] <taplar> if there were only 6 elements.  what are you wanting to do with them
[14:38:11] <al_nz1> morning peeps
[14:38:22] <elquestiono> oh, im creating 6 list items that will be styled as bottles
[14:38:50] <taplar> so a 'box' is a ul/ol and each item is a li?
[14:38:56] <al_nz1> hey taplar
[14:39:05] <taplar> al_nz1: yo
[14:39:29] <al_nz1> hows it
[14:39:42] <elquestiono> taplar: hmm yeah, that could work too. I was just thinking about just adding the value of the box to an element and then do the bottle thingie
[14:39:44] <taplar> s'ok.  trying to get my intellij to run again
[14:40:23] <elquestiono> The thing is i'm not being able to picture the if statement with the variables
[14:40:32] <taplar> elquestiono: ok, i don't really follow cause that's very obscure in relation to html elements, but
[14:40:43] <taplar> what you can do is something like
[14:40:55] <_genuser_> http://pastie.org/10963790
[14:41:16] <_genuser_> so the frames is not null, but stays at length 0, never gets stuff pushed on. even tho it's an array.
[14:42:18] <al_nz1> taplar: oh Intellij - what the cool kids use
[14:42:59] <taplar> elquestiono: https://jsfiddle.net/eku9kvtu/
[14:43:12] <taplar> al_nz1: it's what my workplace uses now days
[14:43:26] <al_nz1> taplar: you work for cool people :)
[14:43:28] <al_nz1> Why isnt the print button printing all tabs : http://ec2-54-252-139-87.ap-southeast-2.compute.amazonaws.com/index1.html
[14:44:32] <elquestiono> taplar: thanks, ill take a look
[14:45:27] <taplar> _genuser_: try logging just frames, don't do that null stuff
[14:49:26] <taplar> al_nz1: what do you mean?  print only prints what's visible on the page
[14:50:57] <_genuser_> taplar: I see the first go around it works fine. when the function is called again it messes up.
[14:51:16] <_genuser_> taplar would calling the function again create a problem in .push()'ing to a "global" var in the script?
[14:51:22] <taplar> what does frames log as the second go around?
[14:51:29] <taplar> shouldn't
[14:54:14] <_genuser_> let me run it with just console.log(frames);
[14:55:39] <al_nz1> taplar: I have a print.css
[14:55:41] <al_nz1> http://ec2-54-252-139-87.ap-southeast-2.compute.amazonaws.com/print.css
[14:56:18] <al_nz1> it prints all tabs, but only the first 5 pages worth (total output should be about 13 pages)
[14:56:31] <MassDebates> Do you have any page flow directives for print?
[14:56:33] <taplar> i'm not familiar with that
[14:56:52] <_genuser_> taplar: logs nothing.
[14:57:04] <taplar> nothing or an empty array?
[14:57:05] <_genuser_> so console.log('frames: '+frames);    logs -     frames:
[14:57:10] <_genuser_> nothing.
[14:57:16] <taplar> don't do the string concat dude
[14:57:20] <taplar> just log the elment, :|
[14:57:35] <_genuser_> sorry, that didn't do anything. but I'll remove the string part.
[14:57:59] <al_nz1> MassDebates: that @me?
[14:58:07] <_genuser_> taplar: the first time it logs [], the next times nothing.
[14:58:08] <MassDebates> At anyone who cares to answer it :)
[14:58:16] <MassDebates> (you)
[14:58:18] <_genuser_> taplar: an empty line
[14:58:20] <taplar> then you have something that is wiping it out
[14:58:27] <taplar> changing it to be not an array
[14:58:42] <al_nz1> MassDebates: sorry I thought it was a suggestion/answer
[14:58:46] <_genuser_> taplar: I see. but my code that posted doesn't seem to be doing anything to it. I'm not sure where it would be getting wiped.
[14:58:58] <MassDebates> It's a question for you to check al_nz1 lol
[14:59:11] <MassDebates> Check your stuff, see if you have any page flow directives, and come back here and tell me.
[14:59:18] <_genuser_> taplar: ok ok, you're 100% right. an ooooold var below in the file var frames='';
[14:59:24] <_genuser_> ugh.
[14:59:27] <taplar> :)
[14:59:28] <_genuser_> thanks for helping me troubleshoot.
[15:00:04] <al_nz1> MassDebates: could you check how many pages you get in chrome when you try to print?
[15:00:09] <al_nz1> I am getting full output in FF
[15:00:30] <MassDebates> If you're telling the content to show up and it's nowhere to be found, either A) You're telling it to be hidden somehow, either by clipping or rules or similar | B) The content can't be printed | C) THe browser considers it not printable material | D) Someone stole it from you.
[15:00:38] <_genuser_> alright that worked! nice.
[15:00:39] <_genuser_> thanks again.
[15:00:40] <MassDebates> I get 5, just like you.
[15:00:59] <al_nz1> weird, so its something to do with Chrome
[15:01:07] <MassDebates> EXACTRY :)
[15:01:19] <MassDebates> Heh, i'd love to see the geniuswads at #css debug this one for ya.
[15:01:24] <MassDebates> Here's what you can do
[15:01:41] <MassDebates> Create a new page with the same CSS files used
[15:01:49] <MassDebates> make 1 looooooooooooooooooong element
[15:01:51] <MassDebates> Super long.
[15:01:59] <MassDebates> (vertically)
[15:02:05] <MassDebates> And tell me what happens when you try to print that suckeroo
[15:02:26] <MassDebates> (bonus points if it's a full-width DIV with solid black background and printed)
[15:02:34] <al_nz1> MassDebates: ok - that might take me a while. I will report back
[15:02:50] <MassDebates> Just kidding on the black background div. That's just a joke that will burn your printer's ink like there's no tomorrow!
[15:03:11] <MassDebates> I love debugging print CSS
[15:03:47] <al_nz1> MassDebates: your a sick man ;)
[15:03:56] <MassDebates> That's what she said
[15:04:02] <MassDebates> ... oh, wait.. that doesn't work for me at all.
[15:04:16] <MassDebates> That's what she said about taplar :P
[15:04:43] <taplar> ;(
[15:04:45] <MassDebates> She actually told me "And You, MassDebates -  You're sick, man. ;) "
[15:04:58] <al_nz1> what does the line .tab-content > .tab-pane do in the print.css
[15:05:06] <MassDebates> ? Wth
[15:05:09] <MassDebates> I don't know, I didn't write it
[15:05:15] <MassDebates> What does the line say?
[15:05:24] <MassDebates> lol
[15:06:07] <MassDebates> What you've given me so far is the selector. Looks like it's targeting a .tab-pane class that's a direct child of the .tab-content class.
[15:09:23] <al_nz1> right, so for this https://gist.github.com/anonymous/ad70d56dbd9a134a2fcb8a71866cbe55 html the selector isnt right
[15:10:43] <al_nz1> acutlly it is : https://gist.github.com/anonymous/4cfe62b225308d86d7ecc80fe2ca56ce
[15:11:18] <MassDebates> Oh, howdy, sorry, kinda forgot about you
[15:11:20] <MassDebates> looking now
[15:12:00] <MassDebates> uh
[15:12:03] <MassDebates> What am I looking at?
[15:12:18] <MassDebates> I thought you were gonna give me the rest of that CSS selector so I can tell you what it does
[15:16:51] <al_nz1> sure
[15:16:55] <al_nz1> http://ec2-54-252-139-87.ap-southeast-2.compute.amazonaws.com/print.css
[15:17:17] <MassDebates> Oh well
[15:17:34] <MassDebates> Seems like there's probably something else at play here.
[15:17:58] <MassDebates> You shouldn't be doing the whole "!IMPORTANT ALL THE THINGS!" lifestyle though.
[15:18:29] <MassDebates> Pop those suckers off real quick and make a minimum height 1em and maximum height of 100vh.
[15:18:34] <al_nz1> remove them all?
[15:18:47] <MassDebates> Remove all phrases of important, keep the styles.
[15:18:53] <MassDebates> Put !important on the 2 styles I told you to put in.
[15:18:57] <MassDebates> Make sure it's only in print CSS
[15:19:25] <MassDebates> And make the styles that I just gave you go under * { /* MassDebates swag here */}
[15:20:08] <MassDebates> replace 'massdebates swag here' with the CSS rules I told you to put in with !important. Don't froget to remove the !importants (but keeping the styles) in your previous version of CSS
[15:20:20] <al_nz1> so:
[15:20:28] <MassDebates> Also, send me a link to the rest of your CSS.
[15:20:35] <al_nz1> min-height: 100 1em
[15:20:37] <MassDebates> Unless if it's all on non-print media queries.
[15:20:41] <MassDebates> No
[15:20:49] <MassDebates> min should be 1em
[15:20:51] <MassDebates> max should be 100vh
[15:21:02] <al_nz1> sorry
[15:21:03] <MassDebates> dont give an actual width on the styles i told you to put in.
[15:21:09] <al_nz1> min-height: 1em
[15:21:11] <MassDebates> Don't say sorry, either.
[15:21:18] <MassDebates> Actually, say sorry for saying sorry. :P
[15:21:32] <al_nz1> ok. not sorry
[15:21:39] <MassDebates> There ya go!
[15:21:49] <MassDebates> Let me see the CSS after and let me know when you're done by sending another link
[15:24:16] <_genuser_> does anybody use outlook.com?
[15:24:55] <MassDebates> Yes
[15:25:08] <MassDebates> I use it extensively for testing HTML email campaigns.
[15:25:25] <_genuser_> oh I see. do you notice it's much slower than gmail?
[15:25:47] <_genuser_> I see outlook.com web interface , they're trying to make it look like the desktop one. but the work that it's doing is somehow pretty slow.
[15:25:55] <_genuser_> it's clunky. and the ads on the side...
[15:26:06] <al_nz1> ok : http://ec2-54-252-139-87.ap-southeast-2.compute.amazonaws.com/index1.html
[15:26:19] <al_nz1> http://ec2-54-252-139-87.ap-southeast-2.compute.amazonaws.com/print.css
[15:26:34] <al_nz1> and the rest of the css styling is default twitter bootstrap
[15:27:49] <achoooew> Hi guys, https://jsfiddle.net/9kxhu9u4/1/ - I am using this method to load content on my site in jquery, is it possible to assign a URL to the target? So if a user refreshes the page, the same content is loaded.
[15:29:44] <taplar> achoooew: you could either stick it in the url hash or possibly use a sessionStorage varialbe
[15:30:53] <al_nz1> MassDebates: as above
[15:31:09] <MassDebates> hi
[15:31:13] <MassDebates> 2 secs, looking
[15:31:22] <achoooew> taplar: which do you think is the simpler option? I'm reading up on sesstionStorage and I am assuming this will only be for as long as the session is stored, what I need is a static link to the dynamically loaded content.
[15:31:38] <MassDebates> Ah, looks like we've got 8 sheets of paper now!
[15:31:53] <al_nz1> MassDebates: I threw the important back on the display: block because I only got two pages if I didnt
[15:32:05] <MassDebates> understood, makes sense.
[15:32:18] <al_nz1> MassDebates: yes - however there is one final tab thats still not getting printed
[15:32:20] <MassDebates> I will go take a MASSIVE dump and then I will be back.
[15:32:30] <MassDebates> When I'm back I'll look at the CSS and new version of the code you have
[15:32:38] <MassDebates> in the meantime, here's what you can do
[15:32:50] <al_nz1> and pg3 and and 4 are overlapping
[15:33:05] <MassDebates> One step at a time. I didn't say we'd fix 30 problems in the first test.
[15:33:13] <MassDebates> Print CSS is a bitch. Ask #css
[15:33:22] <MassDebates> Also, printers are designed by satan.
[15:33:25] <al_nz1> MassDebates:sure. its hard to fix shit when a turtle is poking its head out
[15:33:34] <MassDebates> A fancy turtle, no less.
[15:33:34] <MassDebates> brb
[15:33:51] <taplar> achoooew: static link would be the hash then
[15:38:18] <MassDebates> I'm back
[15:38:39] <MassDebates> And I'm fine, tahnks for asking. Just dropped 6 pounds out of my body, feels like. that's almost a pound a minute!
[15:38:57] <MassDebates> :p
[15:39:13] <MassDebates> Do me a favor and pop in some relative positioning on your jazz, lets see what that does.
[15:39:22] <MassDebates> Also, Come up with a new style, and do something along these lines:
[15:39:36] <MassDebates> html body div { display:block !important; }
[15:40:02] <MassDebates> Try to qualify it as much as you can to get it the highest specificity possible (or give an ID to your main content container within each of your tab panels and tab content things reside)
[15:40:16] <MassDebates> And don't remove your old display:block !important style.
[15:40:21] <achoooew> taplar: I managed to find a way to append the hash for clicked links, but on refresh it just goes back to the homepage.
[15:40:33] <MassDebates> let me know when you're done so I can look at it and see what happens al_nz1
[15:41:30] <taplar> achoooew: i'm thinking something like https://jsfiddle.net/9kxhu9u4/2/
[15:44:44] <achoooew> taplar: Thanks! I understand what you did there, but would an if statement for each unique load request be overkill?
[15:45:04] <taplar> you might could come up with a map of some sort
[15:45:34] <achoooew> taplar: It's a small site so not a huge deal, but I'm just wondering if it's bad practice.
[15:46:30] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/9kxhu9u4/3/
[15:48:34] <taplar> so long as it's readable & understandable & works, your good, :)
[15:49:27] <achoooew> taplar: Thanks a lot for your help. Anything I can do for you?
[15:49:41] <taplar> ooooh, open ended question
[15:49:53] <achoooew> ;)
[15:49:59] <taplar> s'all good man
[15:50:06] <achoooew> cheers
[15:50:17] <achoooew> go raibh maith agat (thank you in Irish)
[15:50:35] <achoooew> actually I don't remember anymore
[15:50:40] <achoooew> it could mean anything
[15:50:56] <taplar> :O, my Scottish heritage grows at you
[15:51:01] <taplar> growls
[15:51:08] <taplar> *sigh*
[15:51:33] <achoooew> A scottish person fired me once
[15:51:55] <achoooew> you people have no empathy
[15:51:59] <MassDebates> ^
[15:52:03] <MassDebates> Can Confirm.
[15:52:16] <MassDebates> Once played Scottish guy in 'friendly' soccer game.
[15:52:23] <taplar> i actually think my history is scotts irish, but really that's 4+ gens ago so who cares, lol
[15:52:24] <MassDebates> Learned 'Friendly' translates to 'Full-Contact without mercy' in scottish
[15:52:57] <taplar> my family crest had squirrels on it.  nuff said
[15:53:01] <achoooew> scottish football league is dirteh
[15:56:52] <hlve> you're dirteh
[15:56:59] <hlve> well, taplar is dirteh
[15:57:15] <taplar> i'm brittney spears dirteh

[16:05:28] <al_nz1> MassDebates: ok - can you position: relative on your min max height or the tab-pane stuff?
[16:06:57] <MassDebates> on the min-max height stuff
[16:07:13] <MassDebates> (in other words, on your wildcard selector)
[16:08:49] <al_nz1> ok. still getting only 7 pages with overlaying

[16:16:48] <al_nz1> Im getting 7
[16:16:57] <MassDebates> Then we've got problems.
[16:16:58] <al_nz1> http://ec2-54-252-139-87.ap-southeast-2.compute.amazonaws.com/index1.html
[16:17:10] <al_nz1> your loading index1 ?
[16:17:16] <MassDebates> Yep.
[16:17:27] <MassDebates> This ain't good.
[16:17:38] <al_nz1> bizzare
[16:17:40] <MassDebates> If I can't see what you see, then one of us is blind.
[16:17:47] <MassDebates> And one thing I've learned about blind people
[16:17:59] <MassDebates> It's harder to paint collaboratively with a blind guy.
[16:18:08] <al_nz1> hahaha
[16:18:21] <al_nz1> you know im doing this with screen reader right?
[16:21:00] <al_nz1> ok - this is interesting. I load the same page in chrome on another computer and all 8 pages print, but very messed up
[16:21:09] <al_nz1> I think its to do with screen resolution?
[16:22:50] <al_nz1> nope - just changed the resolution on my other computer but its output is different to my laptop so screen res doesnt seem to make them print the same stuff
[16:23:26] <kavi> has anyone in this channel used smartmenus ?
[16:24:34] <MassDebates> I'm back
[16:25:14] <al_nz1> MassDebates: I found that with chrome on two different computers
[16:25:40] <al_nz1> the output is different
[16:26:19] <MassDebates> al_nz1:  don't forget (and this is often taken for granted by people who play with ##javascript and just pick up #css for when they need it) - Responsiveness isn't only for digital screens!
[16:26:57] <MassDebates> You need to be aware of different print sizes, different browser preprocessing renders for print, and EVEN different devices printing!
[16:27:29] <MassDebates> (meaning, in some rare cases, 2 different devices printing to the same size of paper on the same printer will have wildly different print results!)
[16:27:45] <MassDebates> At this point, however, we've certainly exhausted the topic of this room.
[16:27:54] <MassDebates> I'd love to help you more, but we're simply being rude to #jquery folks now
[16:28:01] <MassDebates> #css can help you further. :)
[16:28:07] <al_nz1> MassDebates: yeah fair point
[16:28:17] <al_nz1> #css isnt much chop from what I see
[16:28:27] <taplar> ##css iirc
[16:28:28] <MassDebates> I would do it myself, but I'm afraid that I'm no longer welcome to #css - apparently I was showing up a mod.
[16:29:01] <MassDebates> taplar:  it's #css lol
[16:29:06] <taplar> humm
[16:29:07] <al_nz1> MassDebates: how could that be
[16:29:22] <MassDebates> Idk. I guess I'm a dick or something.
[16:29:28] <MassDebates> Oh, wait, no i remember.
[16:29:33] <MassDebates> I was sandbagging a mod because he said some stupid shit.
[16:30:03] <MassDebates> Then I was accused of "hogging the room and not letting other solutions get presented" or some shit
[16:30:10] <MassDebates> Idk, ask the mods in #css-ops
[16:30:32] <sillyslux> there's an #css-ops?
[16:30:39] <MassDebates> at any rate, we're grossly slapping these nice, hospitable #jquery folks in the face. Off you go -> #css will take good care of you when you get there.
[16:30:42] <MassDebates> I promise they will
[16:30:59] <MassDebates> yep sillyslux
[16:31:36] <al_nz1> MassDebates: nah, I prefer to hang here
[16:31:40] <al_nz1> channel is way better
[16:31:46] <al_nz1> I will work on the problem myself
[16:31:51] <al_nz1> you have helped me greatly
[16:34:55] <MassDebates> Understood, Well, #jquery loves you too.
[16:34:59] <MassDebates> And best of luck, sir
[16:38:25] <robertmaxrees> weeeeee
[16:39:06] <taplar> someone just accepted a s.o. answer of mine from apr '15
[16:39:09] <taplar> :/
[16:39:43] <robertmaxrees> neat.
[16:39:52] <robertmaxrees> maybe they have a hard time reading, taplar
[16:40:19] <taplar> really wanted to get any available solutions, :D
[16:41:25] <robertmaxrees> ahahhaa.  needed to make sure they were really sure.  leave it in production for a while.
[16:41:59] <hlve> oh you two
[16:42:21] <robertmaxrees> gotta get a laugh somewhere GOSH
[16:42:31] <taplar> yup
[16:42:45] <taplar> you are what you eat and think.  and i'm nuts
[16:42:52] <hlve> lol
[16:43:13] <hlve> you think of nuts.
[16:43:16] * hlve ponders
[16:43:29] <taplar> they're not all winners, :)
[16:44:07] <taplar> which, in retrospect, is how my mom referred to us kids
[16:44:08] <taplar> BOOM
[16:44:50] <taplar> sunk that battle ship
[16:45:38] <sackdinnermilk> lol
[16:46:12] <MassDebates> wait
[16:46:14] <MassDebates> ...
[16:46:17] <MassDebates> Do you eat nuts?
[16:46:28] <MassDebates> So... you're a gay fish?
[16:46:29] <taplar> don't take that the wrong way
[16:46:37] <MassDebates> Oh FUCK
[16:46:38] <taplar> or the RIGHT way
[16:46:39] <MassDebates> Damnit
[16:46:47] <MassDebates> that's fish sticks
[16:46:50] <MassDebates> FUCK
[16:46:58] <MassDebates> I've been waiting so long to use that sicne I saw it on south park
[16:47:02] <taplar> wait, what?  lol
[16:47:10] <MassDebates> Nothing. I goofed.
[16:47:16] <MassDebates> Nothing to see here, move along...
[16:54:31] <JIds> Why clone is not working?
[16:54:32] <JIds> https://jsfiddle.net/atg5m6ym/8010/
[16:55:21] <MassDebates> What are you cloning?
[16:55:32] <MassDebates> Because I see  clone.find('.opening').attr('name', 'time[' + slot + '][open]');
[16:55:34] <JIds> .time-container
[16:55:44] <JIds>  var $clone = $('.time-container:first-child').clone().appendTo(".time-slots");
[16:56:21] <JIds> When you click on Add shift button, it should clone the inputs
[16:56:30] <hlve> .___.
[16:56:32] <MassDebates> Uh
[16:56:49] <MassDebates> This word
[16:56:53] <MassDebates> I don't think it means what you think it means
[16:56:59] <MassDebates> You're cloning nothingness in a sense, I think.
[16:57:11] <MassDebates> Why not put in a starter element and see if it happens?
[16:58:30] <sillyslux> $('.time-slots').on("click", ".add-shift" <- this expects and .add-shift element to be present in the .time-slots container
[16:58:38] <sillyslux> it's not...
[16:58:51] <sillyslux> it's a sibling to .time-slots
[16:58:59] <JIds> Ohhhh
[16:59:05] <MassDebates> Oh
[16:59:07] <MassDebates> My bad.
[16:59:09] <hlve> Oooooooh
[16:59:19] <JIds> Thankd
[16:59:20] <JIds> Thanks
[16:59:21] <MassDebates> Well, technically I was right
[16:59:23] <MassDebates> For the record.
[16:59:27] <JIds> I changed to body, its fixed
[16:59:28] <MassDebates> I just was right for the wrong reasons.
[16:59:57] <MassDebates> Sorry, I guess if you spend long enough in #css you start getting rusty on jquery
[17:00:19] <hlve> Ooh
[17:00:23] * hlve ohh's
[17:19:07] <achoooew> taplar: hey again, have another quick question if you are here :)
[17:19:15] <robertmaxrees> heckuva day.
[17:19:22] <taplar> that dude jet like an hour ago
[17:19:34] <robertmaxrees> hahahhaa
[17:19:35] <achoooew> ah good I just wanted to talk bad about him behind his back
[17:20:39] <taplar> sup?
[17:20:44] <achoooew> taplar: https://jsfiddle.net/1frxo4v4/
[17:20:56] <achoooew> that's the part of my code that gives the hash
[17:21:12] <achoooew> I am trying to remove the # from the URL but it isn't working
[17:21:53] <taplar> what does $(this).attr("id").replace("#", "") console.log as?
[17:21:55] <achoooew> so it would just be blah.com/imadivwithoutahash
[17:22:00] <achoooew> let me check
[17:22:09] <taplar> and do you really mean 'id' and not 'href'?
[17:22:54] <taplar> cause that line assumes something like <a href="whatever" id="#about">
[17:23:00] <taplar> which is weird
[17:26:57] <taplar> baby Iiiiiiiiii don't, need dolla bills, to have fun tonight...
[17:27:25] * taplar goes to google lyrics
[17:28:07] <robertmaxrees> hahahahhaa
[17:28:22] <taplar> stuck in my head all day
[17:29:44] * taplar pokes achoooew
[17:33:46] <taplar> moar than diemonds, moar that gouald!
[17:48:09] * taplar pokes achoooew
[17:48:11] <taplar> lol
[17:56:33] <robertmaxrees> updog?
[18:05:42] <taplar> :D
[18:48:26] <haber> if I have something like this: https://dpaste.de/0u3s - what happens if some_condition == true? as in, will the ‚Äúreturn false;‚Äù still prevent the form from submitting if some_condition == true?
[18:48:43] <robertmaxrees> yep
[18:49:00] <robertmaxrees> because execution continues after the evaluation,.
[18:49:27] <haber> I see
[18:49:36] <haber> so if I wanted the form to submit iff some_condition == true
[18:49:46] <robertmaxrees> use an else.
[18:49:48] <haber> return false in an else clause would be best?
[18:49:49] <haber> yeah
[18:49:55] <haber> thanks!
[18:49:58] <robertmaxrees> 'kay.
[18:50:45] <taplar> are you doing anything other than conditionally preventing the submit?
[18:54:43] * taplar taps mic
[18:54:58] <haber> taplar: code looks like this: https://dpaste.de/3Uxd
[18:55:16] <haber> polling for that flag, submit if true, don‚Äôt submit otherwise
[18:56:18] <taplar> does that have to be in a submit handler?
[18:57:34] <haber> yeah, I can‚Äôt post the full code unfortunately but the flag is set by some async API calls (calls that use the filled out form data)
[18:58:03] <taplar> so if they click submit multiple times, you'll have multiple intervals going
[18:59:11] <haber> I have ‚Äú$form.find(".submit").prop("disabled", true); ‚Äú as the first line, forgot to include
[18:59:41] <taplar> are there text fields?
[18:59:53] <haber> yep
[18:59:59] <taplar> user can hit enter on a text field to submit
[19:01:04] <taplar> booya, going home time
[19:01:10] <haber> hmm, damn
[19:01:29] <taplar> yeah, might want to look at that a little more
[19:02:00] <taplar> i'm just wondering if you'd want to ignore that loop and just call submit from whatever is creating the variable, or something
[19:02:11] <taplar> any who, i'm outie
[19:02:17] <haber> the text fields are bank account/personal ID data so I‚Äôm using JS to tokenize it so it never touches my server
[19:02:24] <haber> otherwise I‚Äôd use django to automagically do it
[19:02:28] <haber> thanks for your help
[19:02:30] <haber> later!
[20:30:29] <talkJS> i'm trying to debug my jQuery stuff.  When I look at the Event Listeners tab, I see 2 events.  dragger and drop; that both take me to the jQuery.min.js    Is there a way to get it to take me to the actual callbacks that get fired in my code?
[20:48:47] <mechanist> hello everyone
[20:50:21] <mechanist> I would like to know why the div 'spinner' is not showing when I press the Upload button https://jsfiddle.net/t723f2do/1/
[20:59:07] <andrew9183> because show toggles display, not visibility iirc
[21:26:58] <mechanist> andrew9183: thank you alot, that solved for me
