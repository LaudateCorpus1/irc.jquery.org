[00:31:15] <fabioportieri> morning
[01:00:10] <abishek> I have the following code http://pastie.org/8593020 . If my table does not have a ny rows, this doesn't seem to work. How can i fix this?
[01:02:59] <Uhkis> abishek: well does your table have that tbody when there's no rows?
[01:03:49] <abishek> if I do $('#mytable tbody').length when no rows it is 0.
[01:06:03] <abishek> Ukkis, i even tried this and it doesn't work http://pastie.org/8593035
[01:11:37] <xec_> abishek: how about something like this http://pastie.org/8593054
[01:11:45] <xec_> abishek: assuming your html is a <tr>
[01:12:23] <xec_> abishek: oops, missing a ">" at the end there btw
[01:12:35] <xec_> http://pastie.org/8593056
[01:12:35] <abishek> let me give it a try
[01:30:46] <bigbugjava> I get "Error SyntaxError: Unexpected token S" from blueimp file upload, the upload does work and gets to the server, it something in my return from Node.js, I have tried all I can think of, anyone here knows what I need to return so it will display on okay message when upload complete?
[02:10:12] <jnardiello> guys
[02:13:35] <fabioportieri> what
[02:46:42] <nisseni> I'm having a problem with $('#element').on('load'..) - it doesn't work in IE at all. Anyone know something about this?
[02:46:59] <xec_> what sort of element is it?
[02:47:02] <miCSu> I'm trying to add drop event listener for sortable list but the receive event isn't duing anything
[02:48:19] <xec_> miCSu: receive is for when you move items between different sortables
[02:48:26] <miCSu> ah
[02:48:26] <xec_> is that what you're after?
[02:48:28] <nisseni> xec_: what do you mean? It's an <img> element
[02:48:34] <miCSu> nope, just one sortable
[02:49:10] <miCSu> stop it is
[02:49:15] <xec_> miCSu: try change instead
[02:49:23] <miCSu> ok
[02:50:10] <xec_> nisseni: i'm not 100% sure if the load event will trigger if the image is cached
[02:50:26] <nisseni> xec_: might be the reason
[02:50:51] <seutje> depends on the browser, I think
[02:50:55] <seutje> `g imagesloaded
[02:51:44] <seutje> nisseni: http://desandro.github.io/imagesloaded/
[02:59:39] <nisseni> xec_: doesn't work in IE, still
[03:00:20] <xec_> any errors in console?
[03:01:09] <nisseni> or maybe
[03:01:18] <nisseni> just git that didn't push the js file
[03:01:20] <nisseni> only the changes
[03:14:15] <PhonicUK> If I do $(".someClass").hide();, will new elements of .someClass created after the .hide() be invisible too?
[03:14:46] <moijk> no
[03:14:50] <PhonicUK> hmm
[03:15:09] <PhonicUK> is there a decent way of hiding elements that don't yet exist?
[03:15:20] <moijk> they are pretty hidden if they don't exist ;)
[03:15:23] <PhonicUK> :P
[03:15:28] <PhonicUK> I need to have them exist
[03:15:42] <moijk> but just hide them when creating them
[03:15:51] <PhonicUK> aye thats what I'm doing
[03:16:06] <PhonicUK> I wonder if you can change the contents of a <style> tag...
[03:17:06] <moijk> if you make a class for the hidden ones, you could add that and/or remove that based on whether they should be hidden or not
[03:17:31] <moijk> that is the closest thing to "adjusting" global styles i can think of.
[03:17:44] <PhonicUK> indeed, its just that I then have to keep adding/removing classes from a lot of elements when the filter changes
[03:18:16] <PhonicUK> oh god VS just decided to run JSHint over jquery...
[03:18:30] <slax0r> visual studio?
[03:18:34] <PhonicUK> yeah
[03:18:47] <slax0r> what did you expect? it's M$ :)
[03:19:21] <crazydiamond> Hi. I'm using jQuery slider in range mode in my project and have strange bugs. There I have initialized slider in range 1, 100. But when I slide the handle it's not possible for me to get values 1 and 100 simultaneously http://jsfiddle.net/andrewboltachev/2ZLGx/5/
[03:19:22] <PhonicUK> it only does it if you manually add JQ instead of including it as a pcakge
[03:19:25] <xec_> PhonicUK: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9153718/change-the-style-of-an-entire-css-class-using-javascript#answer-9153841
[03:19:50] <PhonicUK> xec_, ah indeed - back to modifying the style rules at runtime
[03:19:59] <moijk> you could manipulate the stylesheet directly i see. but looks rather.. ugly. http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-2-Style/css.html#CSS-CSSStyleSheet
[03:21:05] <xec_> yeah it's not very straight-forward, but makes sense to do if you're trying to manipulate stying of a lot of elements
[03:21:40] <PhonicUK> indeed, I think that when its a lot of elements its one of those cases where the rules need bending
[03:22:59] <miCSu> is there an event for sortable that runs during the change but only when the elements have changed the order?
[03:23:32] <miCSu> I'm currently using change but it triggers error situations when I'm moving the elements too slowly
[03:23:33] <ph88> drag and drop event ?
[03:23:58] <miCSu> well said
[03:25:11] <miCSu> actually ph88 that doesn't change the fact that event runs while dragging and not only when the order changes
[03:26:05] <ph88> maybe there isnt a specific event for that can you can calculate it within another event
[03:34:10] <bigbugjava> anyone knows a good tooltip kit?
[03:35:12] <crazydiamond> bigbugjava, as an alternative you can just use "title" attr
[03:35:27] <Uhkis> qtip2 is pretty nice
[03:35:47] <crazydiamond> Hi. I'm using jQuery slider in range mode in my project and have strange bugs. There I have initialized slider in range 1, 100. But when I slide the handle it's not possible for me to get values 1 and 100 simultaneously http://jsfiddle.net/andrewboltachev/2ZLGx/5/
[03:45:20] <bigbugjava> crazydiamond yeah
[03:45:59] <bigbugjava> crazydiamond want it to be transitions and such
[03:46:07] <bigbugjava> Uhkis will try
[04:15:34] <seutje> crazydiamond: http://jsfiddle.net/2ZLGx/6/ seems to do the trick, weird that it reports it incorrectly thought
[04:15:36] <seutje> though*
[06:12:08] <DevAntoine> ain't there a way to get the data from the server using deferred.failed?
[06:32:12] <DevAntoine> using deferred.fail() there's no better way than doing this? $.parseJSON(jqXHR.responseText)
[06:37:24] <thinced> DevAntoine: how about just specifying dataType as json?
[06:38:05] <DevAntoine> well, the response header is "application/json"
[06:39:51] <DevAntoine> thinced: shouldn't it be ok?
[06:40:29] <thinced> not sure, but try that dataType still
[06:41:34] <DevAntoine> thinced: if I do so the .fail() no longer have arguments
[06:41:53] <thinced> could you paste your code somewhere
[06:42:00] <thinced> i have 10minutes to look at it
[06:42:32] <DevAntoine> thinced: well, it won't be a working example
[06:43:29] <DevAntoine> thinced: http://pastebin.com/ZUmuD3z6
[06:49:17] <Omar-jQM> hi
[06:54:43] <DSX_> hi all
[06:55:09] <DSX_> someone can help me with a problem with selectable ?
[06:56:21] <DSX_> someone can help me with a problem with selectable ?
[06:56:22] <Lehl0r> just post the question DSX_
[06:57:16] <DSX_> thx, i want to cancel some selector, but it's appear this selector doesn't work : "td:not([class])", its cancel all td elements
[07:00:21] <BillCriswell> DSX_: Are you trying to get all tds without a class attribute?
[07:01:02] <BillCriswell> DSX_: http://jsbin.com/UNANIGU/2/edit?html,js,output seems to work just fine.
[07:01:50] <mazzachre> I sometimes need to add a function to a specific DOM element... (Stuff like populators on a form via ajax and such fun) and currently I do $.extend($('#myform').get(0), {populate: function(data) {...}}); Is there some better way of doing this? The population function is rather specific for each form...
[07:02:00] <DSX_> it's what it do. with this cancel selector, all tds are selected. i look this link thx
[07:03:17] <DSX_> BillCriswell: when i just select like your example it works, but in the cancel method of selectable, it doesn't works
[07:05:18] <DevAntoine> I was pretty sure that with deferred.fail() I could directly get my server's data and not make $.pareseJSON(jqXHR.responseText). What am I missing?.
[07:11:01] <mazzachre> My reason for a specific function on the DOM and not a deferred on an ajax function, is that it can be called from different places... And I don't like global functions for specific things like this...
[07:31:47] <drager_> I have some divs and when clicked I want it to "overlap" the other ones, and if you click on the first on again it will "overlap" the second.
[07:44:44] <luist> hey guys... my google maps does not load for the first time (only loads when i refresh the page). can anyone help me? i've heard jquery can solve my problems :) CODE: http://pastie.org/8593582 PAGE: http://riseupstudio.com.br/contato/
[08:01:37] <Jayflux> Hey guys, why does .index() not work in this instance? http://jsfiddle.net/g742q/
[08:02:51] <shoky> Jayflux: you want ul.children().index(li)
[08:03:03] <shoky> or just li.index()
[08:03:23] <Jayflux> oh
[08:03:29] <Jayflux> Thank you
[08:43:04] <ravigehlot> What could I be doing wrong here? http://paste.laravel.com/1jrd
[08:43:38] <BillCriswell> ravigehlot: String concatenation.
[08:43:56] <ravigehlot> BillCriswell: ops..you are right
[08:44:36] <BillCriswell> ravigehlot: Did the console say anything about that?
[08:44:55] <ravigehlot> BillCriswell: Uncaught TypeError: Object function (j,s){return new b.fn.init(j,s)} has no method 'hover'
[08:45:54] <BillCriswell> Ah, well that seems separate from the issue I said.
[08:46:01] <ravigehlot> BillCriswell: it is.
[08:48:04] <BillCriswell> ravigehlot: Are you good on that issue?
[08:48:22] <ravigehlot> BillCriswell: nope
[08:48:37] <ravigehlot> BillCriswell: now it complains about hover (see the error above)
[08:49:48] <BillCriswell> I'm not super familiar with what you're trying to do, but I know hover would be a method in fn. So I'd try $.fn.hover over $.hover.
[08:54:05] <pacmanfan> i'm having a really weird problem with position
[08:54:37] <pacmanfan> it's not working as a static position like it should
[08:54:41] <pacmanfan> would anyone care to take a look?
[08:57:48] <BillCriswell> pacmanfan: I'd just put your code somewhere.
[08:59:19] <ravigehlot> BillCriswell: you were right about tha
[08:59:28] <ravigehlot> BillCriswell: how to use a callback function then, in that manner?
[09:00:03] <pacmanfan> good idea. my problem can be seen at http://engraveacrete.com/shop/stain-test.html
[09:00:25] <pacmanfan> just wave your cursor back and forth over the top image in the left column
[09:00:32] <pacmanfan> my code is http://pastebin.com/1miyGD97
[09:00:47] <BillCriswell> My internet connection hates me today.
[09:01:27] <pacmanfan> my offset is done like: position:{my: "center bottom-20"}
[09:01:46] <pacmanfan> and i think with a fast on/off cycle it is doubling the offset
[09:01:55] <luist> why... WHY isn't my good maps appearing unless i refresh the page????
[09:03:27] <shoky> luist: it appeared for me on the first load
[09:03:44] <luist> shoky: on my website? -.-
[09:03:50] <shoky> ya
[09:04:08] <BillCriswell> luist: It took my connection a second but it did.
[09:04:32] <luist> can't believe that -.-
[09:04:36] <BillCriswell> pacmanfan: You have a lot of errors coming up in the console. I'd take care of those.
[09:05:04] <pacmanfan> i'm a goober, it's not the -20 offset
[09:05:15] <pacmanfan> but i think it's the default offset isn't getting cleared
[09:05:15] <pacmanfan> hmm
[09:05:20] <luist> shoky, BillCriswell, click on another menu section and click on "Contato" again please?
[09:05:55] <shoky> luist yea that doesn't show it
[09:06:28] <BillCriswell> I think I need to turn something off and back on again.
[09:06:31] <luist> shoky: :(
[09:06:37] <shoky> luist the load event won't fire more than once per page load..
[09:08:00] <shoky> (and loading via ajax is not considered a page load)
[09:08:15] <luist> shoky: this is the code for the map: http://pastie.org/8593944
[09:08:40] <shoky> luist: yes and that won't run if you load it via ajax
[09:09:48] <luist> shoky: how should i do it then?
[09:11:20] <shoky> luist: run the map code yourself after loading the new section
[09:12:08] <shoky> don't wait for the load event. i dont even know if that whole <script> is run when you load the map section
[09:14:00] <Metalpwned> Hi, how can i pass an javascript array to php with ajax and jquery.get? I tried: $.get("insertMongoTest.php?id="+$idvalue+"&arrayValues="+$arrayValues,function(response) in js and $arrayValues=$_GET["arrayValues"]; in php but i just get a string
[09:14:51] <pacmanfan> BillCriswell, i took care of 3 errors i saw in the firebug console, i don't see any more. am i missing some more?
[09:15:24] <shoky> Metalpwned: $.get("insertMongoTest.php", {id: $idvalue, arrayValues: $arrayValues}, function(response){...})
[09:15:37] <shoky> tho that seems like it should be a post
[09:18:39] <Metalpwned> shoky: ok thanks that looks nice :P didn't knew that works... but the problem wit the array still exists
[09:20:13] <luist> shoky: how do i load the map code myself :P
[09:20:35] <luist> shoky: its my first time creating the map with styles... i usually embed
[09:21:57] <shoky> luist: you call that init() function
[09:24:21] <luist> shoky: why ALL the sites use the listener then? :(
[09:25:45] <SkramX> hey all. I have an array of objects and i want to do some analytics off the attributes of the objects.. is there a plugin or somethign that will make this easier and more elegant than looping through each and tallying/summing attributes?
[09:27:24] <shoky> luist: you need to use it if the map should appear on page load
[09:27:25] <BillCriswell> You want a plugin to loop through an array?
[09:28:12] <SkramX> BillCriswell: well, there are 6k items.. im just trying to decide what is efficient. maybe i shouldnt be doing this client side... but i prefer to not involve a database.
[09:28:40] <SkramX> i guess anything client side javascript would have to loop through the array no matter what, it just depends on how they abstract it, right?
[09:28:44] <luist> shoky: the map is supposed to appear on page load..... -.-
[09:29:00] <shoky> luist: when you load the section via ajax, that's NOT a page load
[09:32:36] <luist> shoky: and how can i force a page load
[09:32:41] <ravigehlot> shoky: how are you doing?
[09:32:56] <ravigehlot> shoky: Could you look at this for me? http://paste.laravel.com/1jrH
[09:32:57] <shoky> luist: you also need to make sure that the google maps js is even included. cause you're not including it if i load the maps sectiono only via ajax
[09:33:04] <shoky> luist: so i see: Uncaught ReferenceError: google is not defined
[09:33:44] <shoky> ravigehlot: why are you calling $.fn.hover .. ?
[09:33:47] <luist> shoky: i though i fixed this by specifying the maps API v=3
[09:34:16] <ravigehlot> shoky: I am trying to write a function
[09:34:44] <luist> shoky: yeah it seems to be in the code: <script type="text/javascript" src="https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js?v=3&sensor=false"></script>
[09:35:04] <shoky> luist: yeah but you only have that in /contato/
[09:35:15] <shoky> luist: so if you go to http://riseupstudio.com.br/   its not included
[09:35:20] <luist> shoky: but its the only page with the map
[09:35:42] <shoky> luist: so if you go to http://riseupstudio.com.br/   and then click  contato it doesnt include that script, cause youre not loading that whole page, just a part of it via ajax
[09:36:18] <ravigehlot> shoky: a custom function
[09:36:23] <shoky> ravigehlot: make a jsfiddle, and say what you want to happen...
[09:36:31] <shoky> cant help you if i dont know what you wanna do
[09:36:38] <ravigehlot> shoky: sure
[09:36:43] <luist> shoky: pooh now i get it
[09:36:53] <luist> shoky: ill try to fix that
[09:38:27] <ravigehlot> shoky: http://jsfiddle.net/cx26m/
[09:39:38] <andr0id> i want to post two vars to validate.php. is this correct: $.post('validate.php',{username:username}, {password:password}); ?
[09:39:48] <BillCriswell> andr0id: No.
[09:40:32] <andr0id> ok, i have: var username=document.forms["form"]["username"].value; and var password=document.forms["form"]["password"].value;. how to post them to validate.php?
[09:40:49] <shoky> ravigehlot: uh an actual jsfiddle. with html. and images... if you want help, make some effort. i have no idea what your code is trying to do.. wtf is that swapIcons doing inside $.fn.hover ?!
[09:40:58] <BillCriswell> The data is the second argument, so all it would get is { username: username } which I'm not even sure jQuery handles.
[09:41:09] <ravigehlot> shoky: k
[09:41:27] <andr0id> BillCriswell: how to send the two vars then?
[09:43:13] <BillCriswell> andr0id: You can use serializeArray() or serialize(). I would do $.post('/foo', [{name:"username",value: username},{name:"password",value: password}], function(response){ /* Yay */ });
[09:43:29] <BillCriswell> I'd create the second parameter outside of .post()... but you get the idea.
[09:44:06] <mdev> you don't need to specify the name value stuff
[09:45:47] <mdev> $.post("billing.php", {whatever: whatever, whatever2:whatever2 etc... works fine
[09:45:52] <mdev> nevermind you're doing an array, so i'm probably wrong
[09:45:55] <mdev> ;p
[09:46:11] <andr0id> i was just sending those two vars
[09:46:27] <BillCriswell> Why does jQuery take an object like that but doesn't give you an easy to create an object like that like with .serializeArray()?
[09:46:45] <shoky> ravigehlot: http://jsfiddle.net/cx26m/1/
[09:47:02] <BillCriswell> andr0id: { username: username, password: password } should work according to mdev!
[09:47:08] <pacmanfan> argh. got my console errors figured out, still having a positioning problem with jqueryui tooltips :(
[09:47:53] <shoky> i remember having to workaround many issues with jqui tooltips
[09:48:29] <pacmanfan> yeah, they are a pain in my ass every time i touch them.
[09:48:30] <shoky> their api is pretty minimal and not very helpful for many cases
[09:48:48] <shoky> well not just the api, functionality i mean
[09:49:07] <pacmanfan> i have some positioning bug that causes the tooltip to move up and down the page if you mouse on/mouse off too fast
[09:49:51] <pacmanfan> i think internally it's setting an offset value, and if you mouse off and back on too quickly it is not unsetting that value, and increments it
[09:50:20] <pacmanfan> so by varying your mouse on/off frequency you can cause the tooltop to move right up and down the page :/
[09:50:38] <pacmanfan> it is driving me up a wall!
[09:53:04] <BillCriswell> pacmanfan: What if you take the fade effect off?
[09:53:32] <pacmanfan> bill, turning off the fade in effect didn't help, but i will try the fade out too
[09:54:40] <pacmanfan> voila
[09:54:46] <pacmanfan> it was the fade out
[09:55:01] <pacmanfan> great idea, thanks!
[09:55:09] <BillCriswell> I guess the tooltips are just aware of eachother so they don't overlap.
[09:55:40] <pacmanfan> ohhh, that makes sense
[09:56:15] <pacmanfan> although their code demo uses fade in and out, and doesn't suffer from it: http://jqueryui.com/tooltip/
[09:56:21] <BillCriswell> It's weird it creates a new one each mouseover though?
[09:56:54] <pacmanfan> hmm
[09:57:35] <BillCriswell> I would want it to use the same one each time, but maybe there's a good reason otherwise.
[09:58:32] <pacmanfan> i'm not sure how to trace what it's actually doing
[09:58:45] <pacmanfan> but that's a plausible explanation, i think
[09:59:25] <pacmanfan> in which case the routine for making sure one is destroyed before creating another one is broken, then
[09:59:25] <BillCriswell> It does create a new one each time, at least in the demo I'm looking at.
[09:59:39] <pacmanfan> at least in my install, then
[10:00:07] <pacmanfan> because in their demo it looks like only one can exist at once?
[10:01:49] <BillCriswell> How are you initializing the tooltips?
[10:02:27] <pacmanfan> my current iteration: http://pastebin.com/KMZC6NMz
[10:02:51] <pacmanfan> that's in the head section of the page
[10:07:24] <jost> Is there an event that is fired each time some DOM-Element is added or removed, especially when done using jQuery?
[10:08:50] <duch_kazatel> jost there is - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/DOM_event_reference/DOMSubtreeModified
[10:10:02] <jost> duch_kazatel: thanks
[10:11:08] <duch_kazatel> jost I'd avoid using that if possible, though.  What are you trying to do?
[10:13:18] <jost> duch_kazatel: I'm trying to re-apply a polyfill after some AJAX request is finished. I cannot easily use the success or complete callback, since the request is done by rails - so I'm trying to solve this generally: listen to the event once (using jQuery.one), re-apply the polyfills, and then register using jQuery.one again.
[10:14:04] <shoky> pacmanfan BillCriswell that's all weird cause it works fine here  http://jsfiddle.net/Fsfyj/
[10:14:54] <BillCriswell> I blame Obama personally.
[10:15:09] <shoky> good bet
[10:15:12] <ravigehlot> shoky: does jsffidle show results in real time? like, if I hover over an image, will it change the other image on jsfiddle?
[10:15:49] <shoky> ravigehlot: it just shows you your page in an iframe.. so yeah?
[10:16:02] <shoky> wait, what?
[10:16:06] <ravigehlot> shoky: http://jsfiddle.net/cx26m/3/
[10:16:18] <ravigehlot> shoky: when you hover over an image, it is now showing the results like it should
[10:16:38] <ravigehlot> shoky: I wonder if jsfiddle shows the result
[10:16:46] <BillCriswell> First he took our freedom now he's messing with our tooltips.
[10:17:04] <ravigehlot> shoky: nevermind, I got it
[10:17:09] <ravigehlot> shoky: it was my selector
[10:17:12] <shoky> yah
[10:17:53] <shoky> ravigehlot: did you notice that i gave you a solution?
[10:18:15] <shoky> (30 min ago)
[10:19:11] <ravigehlot> shoky: no, I did not. sorry
[10:19:17] <shoky> <shoky> ravigehlot: http://jsfiddle.net/cx26m/1/
[10:19:17] <ravigehlot> shoky: could you send it over again
[10:22:13] <ravigehlot> shoky: yet
[10:22:15] <ravigehlot> shoky: yep
[10:22:17] <ravigehlot> shoky: that did it
[10:22:29] <ravigehlot> shoky: so I wasn't returning hover
[10:22:44] <shoky> it's not about the "return"
[10:23:01] <ravigehlot> shoky: you also wrote as = function
[10:23:03] <shoky> you had it all wrong
[10:23:04] <shoky> ;p
[10:23:22] <ravigehlot> shoky: yep. this makes sense
[10:23:22] <shoky> you were calling $.fn.hover() ...
[10:23:30] <shoky> i'm defining $.fn.swapIcons
[10:23:33] <ravigehlot> shoky: gotcha
[10:23:39] <shoky> 2 very very different things.. calling and defining :P
[10:23:45] <ravigehlot> shoky: the fn name is the name of the function in question no the action
[10:23:58] <ravigehlot> shoke: so fn.name = function (paremeter)
[10:24:15] <ravigehlot> shoky: then you return that result of those callbacks on hover
[10:24:17] <ravigehlot> shoky: okay
[10:24:26] <shoky> eh
[10:24:33] <shoky> the return is only there so you can chain stuff onto it
[10:24:33] <ravigehlot> shoky: thanks
[10:24:47] <shoky> like  $(...).swapIcons('c').css({whatever})
[10:24:54] <ravigehlot> shoky: hummmmm
[10:24:58] <ravigehlot> shoky: k
[10:25:02] <shoky> ravigehlot  http://web.archive.org/web/20130502100718/http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Authoring
[10:25:13] <ravigehlot> shoky: so this would also work without the return if I didn't want to chain methods
[10:25:16] <ravigehlot> shoky: gotcha
[10:25:17] <shoky> yes
[10:25:24] <ravigehlot> shoky: you are the BOMB.com man
[10:25:33] <shoky> lolll thx
[10:25:42] <ravigehlot> shoky: Nope. Thanks to you.
[10:25:55] <ravigehlot> shoky: You should be a teacher.
[10:25:59] <ravigehlot> shoky: You are a good mentor.
[10:26:02] <ravigehlot> shoky: thanks
[10:26:05] <shoky> ;]
[10:26:43] <ravigehlot> shoky: besides jQuery, whatelse do you work with?
[10:28:34] <shoky> at work.. other js stuff, java, c++
[10:29:06] <shoky> or did you mean just js libs?
[10:30:00] <BillCriswell> You do java? Man.
[10:30:31] <ravigehlot> shoky: in general. what are you into? what do you do for a living?
[10:30:32] <shoky> unfortunately ;s
[10:30:33] <duch_kazatel> we work with java here, too, but that's partially because our platform was originally written in ColdFusion.
[10:31:14] <BillCriswell> I'm in the midst of learning Drupal.
[10:31:45] <BillCriswell> I feel like i have a pretty good hold of PHP but understanding Drupal is like a whole other language to me.
[10:32:05] <shoky> ravigehlot im currently workign part time in a small company that ive been with for 10 years :\  as a coder ;p frontend & backend
[10:32:37] <jphase> Drupal hurts my soul, not as much as Joomla, but still...
[10:32:40] <shoky> ravigehlot and i'm into jazz and physics currently ;p
[10:33:14] <shoky> well, always.
[10:33:20] <BillCriswell> jphase: The terminology in the admin is my biggest hurdle and learning what to call what.
[10:33:41] <jphase> yeah, I don't like CMSs that decide to rename common terminology
[10:33:59] <jphase> "Let's call this an article cause.... why call it a page or post like everyone else?"
[10:34:02] <ravigehlot> shoky: What type of work do you guys do? You said that you do java and c++ as well
[10:34:43] <BillCriswell> shoky is also a Sagittarius who likes long walks on the beach.
[10:34:51] <jphase> lulz
[10:38:14] <shoky> ravigehlot: this is the company http://www.ycdmultimedia.com  i work on our webapp thats used to distribute content to our end-stations (in places like hotels, restaurants, retail stores, etc), and to remotely manage & control them
[10:40:44] <shoky> nothing too interesting really
[10:45:27] <BillCriswell> That sounds fancy.
[10:46:02] <aMoniker_> Can anyone explain why jQuery sees fit to include the left/right padding when setting width on these <li> items? 137px
[10:46:08] <aMoniker_> http://jsfiddle.net/KMB6W/1/
[10:46:09] <shoky> you wouldn't think so if you saw it :)
[10:46:54] <BillCriswell> aMoniker_: You have padding set in the CSS.
[10:47:04] <aMoniker_> BillCriswell: Correct. Also box-sizing:border-box
[10:47:27] <duch_kazatel> aMoniker_ there's default padding from the browser.  jQuery is setting the width css property - that's your problem.
[10:47:39] <aMoniker_> duch_kazatel: no, the padding is mine, not default.
[10:47:51] <duch_kazatel> padding is not apart of the calculation for width.
[10:47:54] <aMoniker_> duch_kazatel: also box-sizing border-box should include padding within the width.
[10:47:59] <duch_kazatel> hrm.
[10:48:09] <aMoniker_> notice how the height is correct
[10:48:14] <aMoniker_> and the width is set in the code to the same number
[10:48:17] <duch_kazatel> ah that'
[10:48:22] <duch_kazatel> *that's right - i'm thinking margins.
[10:48:42] <aMoniker_> so, jquery doesn't take into account box-sizing:border-box?
[10:50:13] <duch_kazatel> http://blog.jquery.com/2012/08/16/jquery-1-8-box-sizing-width-csswidth-and-outerwidth/
[10:51:03] <aMoniker_> In that case... what's happening here?
[10:51:38] <aMoniker> oh ok... content width
[10:52:06] <BillCriswell> aMoniker: I think you want $('li').outerWidth( x )
[10:52:51] <BillCriswell> aMoniker: http://jsfiddle.net/KMB6W/2/
[10:53:01] <ravigehlot> shoky: sounds good
[10:53:08] <aMoniker> BillCriswell: cool, I opted for: http://jsfiddle.net/KMB6W/3/
[10:53:11] <BillCriswell> I guess width doesn't account for padding where outerWidth does... I'm not sure I care enough to really figure it out yet.
[10:53:21] <aMoniker> BillCriswell: yeah, that's what duch_kazatel's article was saying
[10:53:36] <BillCriswell> Oh. Who reads those things.
[10:53:41] <BillCriswell> Other people don't know stuff.
[10:57:33] <duch_kazatel> yeah what would the jquery team know about jquery?
[10:57:57] <BillCriswell> Bunch of boobs.
[10:58:08] <duch_kazatel> basically.
[11:13:23] <aMoniker> Is there a clever way to listen for events on pseudo-elements?
[11:13:29] <aMoniker> Do such elements have events?
[11:18:48] <mdev> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12393140/animate-of-pseudo-elements-using-jquery
[11:26:47] <NoiseEee> aMoniker: what's a pseudo element?
[11:27:26] <aMoniker> NoiseEee: like ::after or ::before
[11:27:33] <aMoniker> and it looks like no, they don't do events
[11:27:36] <NoiseEee> aMoniker: that's css
[11:27:53] <duch_kazatel> NoiseEee they're called psuedo-elements though..
[11:28:03] <duch_kazatel> aMoniker do you have an example of what you're trying to do?
[11:28:33] <aMoniker> duch_kazatel: I was going to put left/right arrows somewhere using psuedo-elements, then when those arrows are hovered, kick off some event
[11:29:58] <duch_kazatel> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8301476/add-onclick-with-css-pseudo-element-after
[11:30:19] <duch_kazatel> notably - "CSS pseudo-elements do not create DOM nodes."
[11:30:25] <duch_kazatel> there's your answer.
[11:30:30] <aMoniker> exactly
[11:31:14] <duch_kazatel> that means there's no way to use events, since that's apart of the DOM.
[11:55:37] <daivyk> hi, why I am getting multiple fires on click ? it is because every call to foo a new click event is assigned ? code http://pastebin.com/9E8ERB8X
[11:56:10] <daivyk> if you click 6 times it shows 63 times on console the message "clicked".
[11:56:49] <winterpk> I'm installed the jquery cookie plugin (https://github.com/carhartl/jquery-cookie) but I cannot seem to delete a session cookie I created with php no matter what I do.  Has anyone ever experienced this problem?
[12:11:10] <NoiseEee> daivyk: what are you trying to do?
[12:12:32] <NoiseEee> daivyk: your code assigns a handler over and over again, each time foo() is called  .... not sure what you're trying to do exactly
[12:23:42] <daivyk> NoiseEee: i am learning, but accidentally i did this, so i am trying to figure it out why is this happening
[12:24:16] <daivyk> NoiseEee: is it because i am assigning a click event multiple times ? I thought that the click event was assigned just once
[12:27:47] <NoiseEee> daivyk: you're specifically assigning it each time.
[12:27:51] <NoiseEee> over and over, daivyk
[12:28:06] <daivyk> hummm... ok
[12:28:15] <daivyk> NoiseEee: so it is possible to assign more than once
[12:28:19] <NoiseEee> daivyk: of course
[12:28:35] <daivyk> now explains everything.. hehehe
[12:28:45] <daivyk> thanks
[12:29:37] <daivyk> I thought that it was possible just one time only, so if you do it again, they will assign a new one and discard the old
[13:20:13] <pacmanfan> BillCriswell, i found a collision avoidance option and disabled it, and the problem still occurs. weird, huh?
[13:22:15] <BillCriswell> Haha yeah. Did you see what shoky posted a bit ago? The code worked fine in a fiddle.
[13:23:18] <pacmanfan> yeah, saw that. it must be interacting with one of the other libraries i'm using or something...
[13:23:33] <pacmanfan> prototype is also used on that page
[13:23:54] <BillCriswell> ooooo
[13:24:10] <pacmanfan> but i'm using jquery in noconflict
[13:24:12] <pacmanfan> i think
[13:24:22] <pacmanfan> i'm calling it with jquery instead of binding it to $
[13:26:26] <andr0id> guys: http://pastebin.com/tDvLsFuW <- how can i print this next to the form:  <font color='red'><b>Username and/or password are incorrect!</b></font> instead of the alert?
[13:28:47] <andr0id> anyone?
[13:29:01] <duch_kazatel> andr0id can you convert that to a jsfiddle?
[13:30:46] <andr0id> ok
[13:31:43] <duch_kazatel> either way, it's pretty easy - just do something like $('form').after('<b>Username and/or password are incorrect!</b>');
[13:31:57] <andr0id> http://jsfiddle.net/D48GV/
[13:33:25] <andr0id> thanks duch_kazatel for the $form :D
[14:19:42] <mobcat40> which is better, use fragment and add to it and put it into DOM when done, or use detach and add to it and put it back in DOM when done?
[14:20:17] <mobcat40> I have a few different scripts that build widgets inside a div or modify existing html content
[14:23:06] <hyppias> beginners question: EPUB/iBook/iPad <detaiuls> <summary> question:  http://pastebin.com/DvMtMdYK
[14:23:35] <mobcat40> any ideas?
[14:25:08] <aMoniker> mobcat40: doesn't the underlying engine use fragments automatically?
[14:27:43] <ColdKeyboard[a]> If I use .addClass() on element that allready has a class that I'm trying to add via .addClass(). Will it be added twice or will jQuery just ignore it?
[14:31:13] <shoky> ColdKeyboard[a] it'll ignore
[14:31:21] <ColdKeyboard[a]> Thanks
[14:31:41] <ColdKeyboard[a]> I used CSS live view in firefox to check it out... It seems like it's ignoring it :)
[14:53:11] <JapieDay> guys i've been trying to get my TEST button in top of this page going: http://pitchupmedia.nl/index.php its supposed to go animated scroll to my div id "overons" but it doesn't scroll but goes straight to that div, i can't seem to figure out what is wrong. The js is @ http://pitchupmedia.nl/js/parallax.js
[14:55:46] <aMoniker> JapieDay: changing the hashtag to #overons probably makes the browser scroll automatically
[14:56:41] <JapieDay> aMoniker: yes i was on to that aswell, but i wouldn't know where to point my link elsewhere
[14:57:19] <aMoniker> JapieDay: maybe e.preventDefault() or return false in the click handler would interrupt that and allow you to keep the href
[14:57:37] <faddah> JapieDay: why are you recursively calling the function redrawDotNav() within itself? is that to populate the animated scroll as it goes down?
[14:58:35] <JapieDay> faddah:  to be honest i don't know i have not written this myself, but i am trying to modify something else in order to get it working for me
[14:59:13] <Gmac_> I'm using stopPropogation cause i need it but it seems i lose the ability in webkit to allow users to select all
[14:59:16] <Gmac_> ctrl+a
[14:59:19] <Gmac_> or cmd+a
[14:59:25] <JapieDay> i actually emptied that last piece of script because it was running wrong
[15:00:05] <faddah> JapieDay: hrmmmm... therein may lie your issue. i would take that parallax.js and reduce it down in a jsfiddle or gist or code0 to what you want it to do and try there, with just the menu, the one TEST element and where you want to scroll to.
[15:01:30] <JapieDay> faddah: good point, once i finish that, can i ask you for help again?
[15:02:44] <faddah> JapieDay: sure, it's what the channel is for. if i'm afk, someone else will eventually answer.
[15:03:44] <faddah> in the meantime, do you know how JavaScript recursion (a function calling itself within the function - an alternative to looping) works?
[15:03:55] <faddah> that was meant for JapieDay
[15:04:08] <JapieDay> faddah:  no i don't
[15:04:59] <donquixote> hi!
[15:05:15] <JapieDay> faddah: i tried this now
[15:05:17] <JapieDay> http://jsfiddle.net/#&togetherjs=gcp97432ki
[15:06:48] <donquixote> i am writing a table widget with jquery, with a number of behaviors that in an ideal world would be independent: collapse/expand (tree-like), checkboxes on each row which sometimes have side effects on other rows, other criteria for row visibility..  i am looking for a way to implement these behaviors separately but then somehow plug them together. any ideas?
[15:06:55] <harrydog> is there a way to force the calendar popup (jquery UI) to always show underneath the input field?
[15:06:58] <faddah> JapieDay: well, your very first function in parallax.js, redrawDotNav() , does it. looking up a free tutorial for it, for you...
[15:08:27] <JapieDay> faddah: thx a bunch :)
[15:09:00] <donquixote> http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/222957/recommended-architecture-for-an-interactive-table-widget-with-multiple-behaviors
[15:10:02] <JapieDay> faddah: have you seen my fiddle link there?
[15:12:44] <faddah> JapieDay - i am running back and forth looking up that recursion in JS tutorial for you and doing other things here. please be patient.
[15:13:14] <JapieDay> faddah: sure :)
[15:18:00] <faddah> JapieDay: here's a free and easy JS tutorial on recursion - http://www.codecademy.com/courses/javascript-lesson-205/0/1
[15:27:08] <JapieDay> faddah: thanks again !
[15:50:45] <datarecal> I am trying to debug a large jquery script its giving chrome's blue page on an even but can't figure out why any thoughts on how to debug it
[15:54:40] <datarecal> nm it was console.log crashing chrome
[16:06:16] <Tomashe> hey guys, i saw that link : http://www.adira.co.il/views/partners/3d/design.php , there is a flash designer there, wondering if i can do something like that in JS ?
[16:08:00] <harrydog> sure, if you got 10,000 hours to spare
[16:08:56] <Tomashe> why 10,000?
[16:09:01] <Tomashe> i dont want someone to do it for me
[16:09:31] <JapieDay> JS is probably not the way to go if you want to do such a project...
[16:09:45] <Tomashe> so what are u recommanding ?
[16:09:55] <Tomashe> since im brainworking of the right technology for it
[16:10:07] <Tomashe> other then flash ofcourse
[16:10:44] <Tomashe> i was thinking about jquery/js with css3
[16:11:16] <Tomashe> but that have its own limits with none css3 supported browsers + im not sure how heavy will it be to load such a thing with JS
[16:11:22] <harrydog> is there an english version of that feature?
[16:11:31] <Tomashe> yes , its an AUTODESK
[16:11:57] <harrydog> did that use to be called dragonfly
[16:12:01] <Tomashe> http://iw.homestyler.com/
[16:12:19] <tw2113> i think something like that is above dom libraries and css
[16:12:37] <shoky> Tomashe: i worked on something a bit similar, in js with svg
[16:12:48] <Tomashe> http://www.homestyler.com/designer
[16:13:06] <harrydog> you can do all of that in js/css, but it would be time consuming
[16:13:09] <shoky> you can check it out here   https://app.socialtables.com/?space=13939
[16:13:21] <harrydog> would work on ipads though, so maybe that's a plus
[16:13:22] <Tomashe> hmm
[16:13:34] <shoky> it would be time consuming with any language/technology
[16:14:13] <JackBauer24> Tomashe: if it's supposed to be a web app, then JS is probably the best way to go
[16:14:20] <JackBauer24> but as it's been said, it's a huge task
[16:14:24] <Tomashe> yes a web app
[16:14:40] <Tomashe> how much time something like that should take ?
[16:14:57] <harrydog> if you have to ask, you'd probably have a hard time doing it at all
[16:14:58] <shoky> depends how good and fast you are..
[16:15:22] <grafi> shoky can do it in 5minutes
[16:15:22] <grafi> :P
[16:15:41] <Tomashe> for u shoky for example
[16:15:57] <Tomashe> or u harrydog
[16:16:03] <harrydog> a year at least
[16:16:05] <shoky> weeks, at least
[16:16:30] <Tomashe> so i know its gonna take weeks , i was thinking more about MONTHS but ok
[16:16:47] <harrydog> something like that i'm sure took them a very long time, and a team of developers to do
[16:17:05] <Tomashe> so but i need some estimation from a professionals like u
[16:17:06] <Tomashe> hehe
[16:17:14] <Tomashe> "long time" is not an estimation
[16:17:28] <harrydog> probably a year long project with a team of developers
[16:17:34] <harrydog> unless you're a genius
[16:17:36] <Tomashe> seriously?
[16:18:02] <harrydog> it's not simple, it's more like like a full-fledged app, with lots of features
[16:18:04] <shoky> it's impossible to give a good answer, Tomashe
[16:18:05] <Tomashe> and if we removed the ability to modify walls and elements on the fly ?
[16:18:52] <JapieDay> Tomashe: this kind of project is best to be developed in a different way than through an HTML/JS/CSS/SVG solution, what do you want to make exactly?
[16:19:45] <Tomashe> i want to make almost the same as that JUST with the out the ability to modify elements on the fly
[16:19:53] <Tomashe> so there are some fixed elements basicly
[16:19:55] <JackBauer24> Tomashe: just write down all the features you want and think about what steps you have to make to accomplish each of them and then you'll find out how much time it's going to take in YOUR case
[16:20:09] <grafi> times 3
[16:20:14] <grafi> for accuracy
[16:20:16] <grafi> :P
[16:20:18] <Tomashe> hehe
[16:20:19] <Tomashe> yeah
[16:20:32] <Tomashe> so what about technology, JapieDay mention
[16:20:50] <TimsterToo> I'm having a complete brainfart. Can someone tell my why this: http://jsfiddle.net/FullContactCoding/jeANH/ does work and this: http://jsfiddle.net/FullContactCoding/dZB5u/ doesn't?
[16:20:52] <Tomashe> im getting crazy about choosing the right technology
[16:21:23] <JapieDay> Tomashe: this would be easier to do in Java for example
[16:21:24] <grafi> always choose java
[16:21:27] <grafi> its perfect
[16:21:41] <Tomashe> TimsterToo: its working perfectly
[16:21:53] <JapieDay> grafi: hehe
[16:22:00] <JapieDay> i wouldn't say that
[16:22:01] <Tomashe> but java will work on cross platform
[16:22:12] <Tomashe> it doesnt looks like the right tech at all
[16:22:23] <grafi> i wasnt being serious JapieDay :x
[16:22:24] <Tomashe> i cannot do anythign with java
[16:22:32] <grafi> what?
[16:22:41] <Tomashe> man its 2:22 , everything u say im talking serious
[16:22:48] <grafi> thats down to your skills oô
[16:22:52] <Tomashe> and im very very tired lol
[16:23:00] <grafi> maybe you should choose the right dev for the job first xD
[16:23:14] <Tomashe> to chose the right dev i need to chosoe the right TECH
[16:23:41] <Tomashe> FLASH,OR JS
[16:23:55] <Tomashe> those seems like the best options outthere
[16:23:57] <grafi> that seems very limiting
[16:24:40] <Tomashe> ok im falling a sleep
[16:24:44] <Tomashe>  we will continue that tomorrow
[16:24:46] <Tomashe> hehe
[16:24:48] <noober3> can someone tell me how to call a function that needs a parameter using window.onload?
[16:24:50] <grafi> dont hit the ground too hard
[16:24:58] <Tomashe> have a good night
[16:25:07] <JapieDay> Tomashe: you might wanna look into C++ or C# aswell..
[16:25:38] <TimsterToo> Tomashe, can
[16:25:45] <TimsterToo> can't even get that right http://jsfiddle.net/FullContactCoding/dZB5u/2/
[16:25:49] <TimsterToo> this one doesn't work
[16:26:22] <grafi> because its not the right syntax
[16:26:38] <grafi> either use a value object or "color", "red"
[16:27:46] <TimsterToo> grafi, thanks. As I said, brainfart.
[16:29:32] <JackBauer24> noober3: I'm not sure what do you mean, but inside of the anonymous function you can call whatever you want, as it is showed here: http://api.jquery.com/ready/
[16:31:01] <noober3> ok thanks. i was trying to create a file that has my js functions then call it later from my page passing in a variable to a function. prob need something like $(document).ready(function() { addClass() });
[16:31:53] <noober3> that would be called from my php file and be linked to the js page with the addClass function, is this right?
[16:34:23] <JackBauer24> noober3: just include the JS file with a function before usage
[16:34:51] <Smashman> Hi there, I have an issue that's massively stumping me and a friend. Am I able to discuss it with you guys?
[16:35:09] <noober3> ok thanks
[16:36:43] <grafi> Smashman just try
[16:37:00] <thebope> suppose I have nested .each functions, is there a way to access the this from the upper level?
[16:37:20] <thebope> so ...each(function() { ... .each(function() { ...
[16:37:35] <thebope> Oh and hi everybody
[16:37:41] <shoky> var self = this;
[16:37:51] <thebope> Ahh awesome thanks shoky
[16:38:24] <Smashman> Alrighty. Essentially I have a function that adds a checkbox to a number of elements. I then want to bind a function when each is changed.
[16:38:41] <Smashman> But for some reason, on my computer, the events do not get bound unless I put a delay
[16:38:51] <Smashman> But on my friend's, it works perfectly
[16:39:03] <thebope> Same browser?
[16:39:10] <Smashman> Yes
[16:39:26] <thebope> Maybe a 200 ms delay or even a 50 ms delay?
[16:39:36] <thebope> THat shouldn't affect user experience
[16:39:42] <Smashman> When I add 100ms delay, it works, but that's a bit weird and hacky
[16:40:36] <JackBauer24> Smashman: What jQuery version are you using?
[16:40:48] <Smashman> jQuery v1.10.1
[16:40:54] <Smashman> Both of us
[16:41:16] <Smashman> This is for a Chrome extension, if that sheds any light
[16:43:23] <Smashman> It doesn't try executing the bind code until finishing with the each loop see:http://smash.mn/s/1388709774.png
[16:43:29] <Smashman> And yet it just doesn't bind.
[16:43:44] <Smashman> I've check Event Listeners in Chrome, it's not listed
[16:43:51] <thebope> hmm, is there a way to do something along the lines of input[value= *variable*]?
[16:44:00] <shoky> `demo @ Smashman
[16:44:00] <b-ot> Smashman: Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[16:44:15] <Smashman> Yeah, figured you'd say that
[16:44:30] <Smashman> Not exactly easy due to its being an extension
[16:44:33] <Smashman> I'll see what I can do
[16:44:52] <shoky> thebope:  'input[value=' + myvar + ']'   but that won't find the runtime values of inputs
[16:45:26] <thebope> shoky,  thanks
[16:45:27] <thebope> hmm
[16:45:31] <thebope> I'm not sure that will work then
[16:45:38] <thebope> I was having issues with a similar solution earlier
[16:45:53] <thebope> It'd have to be like a scala variable or something
[16:46:00] <thebope> or I guess ruby if you're using that, etc
[16:46:31] <grafi> oO
[16:46:33] <shoky> thebope: $('input').filter(function() { return this.value.indexOf(myvar) !== -1 })
[16:46:40] <shoky> er
[16:46:46] <shoky> donno why i wrote indexOf
[16:46:56] <shoky> $('input').filter(function() { return this.value === myvar })
[16:46:58] <grafi> what does the fox say?
[16:47:09] <shoky> meowy
[16:47:39] <thebope> oh wow thats awesome shoky thanks
[16:47:43] <thebope> I wouldn't have thought of that
[16:47:49] <thebope> I need to just read the jquery api one day
[16:48:04] <thebope> its funny be a full stack engineer with little experience in the techs you're using!
[16:49:28] <grafi> "funny"
[16:49:29] <grafi> :P
[16:49:55] <Smashman> Live example is hard
[16:50:15] <grafi> just put some html and some js oô
[16:50:17] <grafi> no?
[16:51:07] <thebope> lol grafi
[16:51:15] <Smashman> Would be good if it worked :D
[16:51:42] <grafi> why wouldnt it?
[16:52:07] <Smashman> Well it modifies an existing page, with a whole ton of extra stuff
[16:53:01] <grafi> leave out the extra stuf
[16:53:03] <grafi> f
[16:53:06] <grafi> :P
[16:53:30] <Smashman> I'd be at that for a year
[16:53:38] <grafi> oô
[16:53:51] <grafi> didnt you say something about adding checkboxes?
[16:53:57] <Smashman> yes
[16:53:58] <noober3> what would cause a document.ready function to not load but a window.onload works?
[16:54:00] <shoky> adding checkboxes. at least 3 years
[16:54:02] <grafi> so
[16:54:07] <grafi> have some elements
[16:54:15] <grafi> have some code that adds checkboxes
[16:54:24] <JackBauer24> :D
[16:54:37] <grafi> that should be a minimal example of what you are doing
[16:55:46] <Smashman> Ok I got it working in jsfiddle
[16:55:53] <grafi> wohoo
[16:55:53] <grafi> ^^
[16:55:57] <Smashman> Except the issue is not present...
[16:56:08] <grafi> even better
[16:56:13] <Smashman> not really..
[16:56:32] <shoky> and you're not linking to the fiddle because ... ?
[16:56:55] <grafi> how different is the js form the original
[16:57:07] <Smashman> the js is precisely the same
[16:57:45] <Smashman> http://jsfiddle.net/ZSzyv/
[16:57:46] <grafi> so pile onto the markup
[16:57:51] <grafi> until it stops working
[16:58:06] <Smashman> ok copying entirety of Steam page
[16:59:49] <JackBauer24> Smashman: The Steam sales are over in 17 hours, you will have to adjust the code to the new layout anyway :P
[16:59:55] <grafi> xD
[17:00:00] <Smashman> No I won't..
[17:00:07] <Smashman> That's a default store page
[17:00:15] <Smashman> http://store.steampowered.com/app/49520/
[17:00:28] <Smashman> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MM7Qj72-OPQ
[17:00:40] <Smashman> That's the working example
[17:01:18] <Smashman> But the events do not get bound for me
[17:01:29] <Smashman> Which likely mean they won't get bound for other users that we may ship to
[17:02:23] <noober3> i have window.onload=function () {$('#photos').addClass('active');}; but when i try $(document).ready instead the class is not added, any suggestions?
[17:03:55] <Smashman> So... No ideas whatsoever?
[17:04:43] <grafi> not really
[17:04:52] <grafi> :|
[17:05:26] <JackBauer24> Smashman: can't really figure out anything without seeing the issue, but instead of binding events with .change()
[17:05:42] <JackBauer24> you can try to bind to all your checkboxes with .on()
[17:05:44] <JackBauer24> http://api.jquery.com/on/
[17:05:50] <shoky> .change uses .on
[17:06:01] <Smashman> I have tried it with that
[17:06:03] <Smashman> and .bind
[17:06:03] <shoky> that is,  .change is same as .on('change'
[17:06:33] <shoky> Smashman: try event delegation.  $(document).on("change", ".es_dlc_selection", add_dlc_to_list );
[17:06:50] <grafi> yeah
[17:06:52] <shoky> you can run that even before adding the checkboxes, it doesn't matter
[17:06:58] <grafi> shoky is da man
[17:06:59] <grafi> :P
[17:07:44] <Smashman> I do not even understand what that did
[17:07:47] <Smashman> But that did indeed work
[17:08:14] <Smashman> So why did that method work, shoky
[17:08:47] <shoky> Smashman i dont really know why it didnt work for you the way you did it.. i'd need to see it happen live
[17:09:18] <shoky> but event delegation is the proper way to listen for events coming from multiple similar elements like these checkboxes,
[17:09:32] <shoky> and it doesn't depend on the existence of the elements you're listening for
[17:11:10] <shoky> (what its doing is listening for change events on the document element, that are bubbled up from inner .es_dlc_selection elements)
[17:11:42] <Smashman> ok
[17:11:50] <Smashman> Well I will note for future :)
[17:11:54] <Smashman> Thank you!"
[17:12:11] <shoky> no probbies
[17:16:15] <grafi> no bubbles
[17:16:29] <shoky> yes bubbles
[17:16:58] <thebope> hey thanks for your help shoky
[17:17:16] <shoky> np thebope
[17:37:00] <ekh> Hello
[17:37:41] <ekh> How do I map "key up" trigger to a "change" i already have?
[17:38:07] <ekh> I want the dropdown menu to trigger the event even if the value is changed using the keyboard
[18:00:54] <Rohan_Bhangui> hi guys
[18:01:08] <Rohan_Bhangui> i have been experimenting with display: table
[18:01:12] <Rohan_Bhangui> properties
[18:01:15] <Rohan_Bhangui> I have a table now
[18:02:13] <Rohan_Bhangui> except the table wont overflow beyond the screen dimension
[18:02:16] <Rohan_Bhangui> *dimensions
[18:03:04] <Rohan_Bhangui> so i figured that I could modify the cells so that they show in 1 line
[18:03:07] <Rohan_Bhangui> is this possible
[18:03:13] <Rohan_Bhangui> for the cells im using display: table-cell
[18:05:00] <scipy53> My Jquery click event works fine in desktop browsers, but in mobile, they only work after I focus on a random text field for some reason. Any ideas?
[18:05:14] <Rohan_Bhangui> so how do I set a width such that for every cell the width fits to the content
[18:05:21] <Rohan_Bhangui> such that the content is on 1 line
[18:05:35] <Rohan_Bhangui> and for a particular column the rest of the cells will take the size of the largest cell
[18:06:11] <vladikoff> Rohan_Bhangui, wrong channel?
[18:07:23] <Rohan_Bhangui> vladthis can be solved using jquery
[18:07:27] <Rohan_Bhangui> i know that
[18:07:43] <Rohan_Bhangui> vladikoff: this can be solved with jquery
[18:08:00] <Rohan_Bhangui> not even juqery ui
[18:09:30] <jedimind> vladikoff: but it can be solved!
[18:09:32] <jedimind> :)
[18:10:01] <Rohan_Bhangui> ahhhhh
[18:10:05] <Rohan_Bhangui> jedimind: my man
[18:10:10] <Rohan_Bhangui> long time no talk
[18:10:17] <jedimind> how goes it
[18:10:22] <Rohan_Bhangui> alls well
[18:10:28] <Rohan_Bhangui> just working on some sortable tablestuff
[18:10:35] <Rohan_Bhangui> using new css properties
[18:10:50] <Rohan_Bhangui> jedimind: how goes it with you
[18:11:07] <jedimind> good good, just got back to work today after being off since dec 14th or so
[18:11:14] <Rohan_Bhangui> nice nice
[18:11:19] <tesmar> hi all, can I change the href and have the resulting AJAX request be sent from jQuery?
[18:11:27] <Rohan_Bhangui> ya I had off to, starting back up on the 10th jan
[18:11:27] <tesmar> right now it is sent from just the browser
[18:11:38] <tesmar> i.e. X-Requested-With:XMLHttpRequest
[18:13:10] <tesmar> right now I have this is an on click: https://gist.github.com/tesserakt/c8e2488db0041fe9cc4c
[18:13:16] <Rohan_Bhangui> jedimind: so bascially here is my set up: (1) i have a divs that are in a table-column-cell structure which uses display: table and other such properties to create the table. (2) I have jquery sortables enabled for the columns so that I can sort them
[18:13:17] <tesmar> it makes the HTTP request
[18:13:29] <jedimind> why
[18:13:37] <tesmar> but the return is a bunch of JS I would like to execute
[18:13:41] <jedimind> if you have tabular data, use a table
[18:14:26] <Rohan_Bhangui> jedimind: i need more flexibility when it comes to styling the table
[18:14:35] <Rohan_Bhangui> <tables> and related dont offer those things
[18:14:58] <Rohan_Bhangui> plus it gives me a reason to try something new and different :P
[18:15:16] <jedimind> it also wastes your time with hypothetical scenarios that arent realistic
[18:15:24] <jedimind> do you have it up somewhere?
[18:15:40] <jedimind> i mean you're effectively ignoring just about every rule
[18:15:55] <jedimind> in respect to what each language is supposed to be doing in the stack
[18:18:07] <Rohan_Bhangui> jedimind: understand that the data that is suppose to be in the table is being replaced by some sudo data so you will need to  fiddle around and stuff (the real data is private so)
[18:19:10] <Rohan_Bhangui> ill simulate the problems in haivng though
[18:20:50] <Rohan_Bhangui> jedimind: http://jsfiddle.net/PVC58/
[18:20:59] <Rohan_Bhangui> the second issue i wasnt able to simulate
[18:21:02] <Rohan_Bhangui> but the idea is
[18:21:15] <Rohan_Bhangui> that cells if they have a space/no content or if the  content is too large
[18:21:23] <jedimind> you're not using the css properly?
[18:21:26] <Rohan_Bhangui> then it doesnt resize the row to make all the cells inline
[18:22:17] <jedimind> the column should be table-row
[18:22:18] <Rohan_Bhangui> it needs to be columns or the sortable columns dont work
[18:22:19] <jedimind> i cant help you with this
[18:22:20] <Rohan_Bhangui> jedimind: ?
[18:22:20] <jedimind> more specifically there's no point in helping you with this
[18:22:26] <Rohan_Bhangui> explain.
[18:22:27] <jedimind> you're doing it all entirely ass backwards
[18:22:31] <jedimind> i already explained
[18:22:44] <Rohan_Bhangui> okay so then how would you do sortable column table
[18:22:48] <jedimind> you're not using html or css properly, and now you want to add javascript to the mix for adjusting heights of things
[18:22:52] <jedimind> with a ... TABLE
[18:24:13] <Rohan_Bhangui> okay
[18:24:16] <Rohan_Bhangui> thanks anyways
[18:24:33] <jedimind> <3
[18:24:46] <Rohan_Bhangui> hahaha
[18:25:01] <Rohan_Bhangui> i have to creat this for a client
[18:25:03] <Rohan_Bhangui> so
[18:25:12] <Rohan_Bhangui> styled sortable by column table is a must
[18:26:39] <jedimind> no
[18:26:48] <jedimind> a properly coded, structure, maintainable source code is a must
[18:26:53] <jedimind> not "hack this shit away so it looks pretty"
[18:27:02] <jedimind> because at that point you're selling your client a lemon
[20:36:51] <jkingaround> hey guys. i'm attempting to combine the forces of twitter bootstrap + jquery validate plugin. i have a search field and I want the error to show up in an "error" styled alert underneath it. that appears when they try to submit an empty query. http://jsfiddle.net/6C4Jm/5/ this is what i want it to end up looking like design wise but can't get the error message to show up in the right place.
[20:41:33] <aMoniker> jkingaround: well why not?
[20:42:10] <jkingaround> aMoniker: if i knew that, i wouldn't have a problem. i've tried using the error container option to no avail :[
[20:42:23] <aMoniker> jkingaround: can you show a live example?
[20:42:51] <jkingaround> in terms of?
[20:43:29] <aMoniker> where isn't it working?
[20:44:00] <jkingaround> if you look at the fiddle, i want the alert to show up upon submit (like the form breaking error message currently)
[20:44:07] <jkingaround> and have it say the error
[20:52:03] <shoky> jkingaround: http://jsfiddle.net/6C4Jm/6/
[20:54:00] <jkingaround> shoky: Thank you!
[20:54:17] <shoky> though bootstrap removes the contents when you click that X
[20:54:31] <shoky> rude.
[20:54:47] <hopkins83> Hello! How do I make Selectize (http://brianreavis.github.io/selectize.js/) preserve custom data attributes? http://jsfiddle.net/YaCPF/
[20:55:14] <jkingaround> shoky: isn't that the expected behavior?;)
[20:56:28] <shoky> jkingaround: i'd expect it just to hide the element. but maybe i'm just not used to the bootstrap way or smth
[20:57:23] <jkingaround> ohhh. if you click the x it'll permanently dismiss it. no bueno
[20:57:28] <jkingaround> forget that XD
[20:57:32] <shoky> yah ;p
[21:21:11] <Rohan_Bhangui> jedimind: still around
[21:21:54] <mikeyyz> hey guys, I'm trying to make a button trigger a file upload dialog by hiding the input behind it... but can't seem to figure out how to disable the default onclick action on the button (which isn't letting the input trigger) after lots of googling. any tips?
[21:23:00] <Velveeta> mikeyyz: so, what are you trying to do exactly? hide a file input behind a button input and then do what?
[21:28:45] <mikeyyz> Velveeta: When the button is clicked, it should pop up the file input (based on z-index)
[21:29:07] <Velveeta> right, but how are you stacking those? the button over the file input?
[21:29:09] <mikeyyz> but because of jQuery mobile's handling of the button style, it seems to trigger the style changes on the button but not pass-through the click below to the input
[21:29:25] <mikeyyz> I'm wondering if there's an easy way to disable the click-handling on the a tag (button)
[21:29:26] <mikeyyz> Right
[21:29:28] <mikeyyz> button over input
[21:29:39] <mikeyyz> (here: http://unhabitat.tigweb.org/post?tigweb3=true)
[21:30:32] <Velveeta> well, i'm pretty sure you can't programmatically open a file dialog by just triggering click on it via javascript
[21:30:42] <Velveeta> i'm pretty sure it requires an explicit click on the element
[21:31:10] <Velveeta> the technique i've seen previously, similar to what you're describing, involved stacking the file input on top of the button, but making the file input opacity 0 so it was totally transparent
[21:31:24] <Velveeta> then the user thinks they're clicking on the button, but instead, they're clicking on the file input
[21:32:00] <Velveeta> as far as disabling the click handling on a button tag, that's as simple as receiving the event object in the click handler, and running an event.preventDefault() on it
[21:32:41] <mikeyyz> yup, agree - that's what I found in examples online - but JQM seems to be overriding the element with its click handling
[21:33:17] <mikeyyz> oh I see... you're saying file input on top of the button interesting
[21:33:25] <Velveeta> right, but make it completely transparent
[21:33:40] <Velveeta> there's no way to pass a click through from a button *to* the file input and make it open the dialog
[21:33:47] <Velveeta> the user has to physically click on the file input
[21:40:52] <Velveeta> mikeyyz: something like this: http://jsfiddle.net/e7DF2/1/
[21:44:57] <mikeyyz> right sorry, I didn't understand what it was doing in the first place ;)
[21:45:08] <mikeyyz> it seems my actual problem is that the opacity css I have in there isn't being applied properly
[21:45:47] <Velveeta> i have jquery mobile loaded into that fiddle also, and it's not mucking w/ the opacity of that element… what are you doing that's not working?
[21:46:30] <mikeyyz> there we go - had to apply it directly to the id. thanks for helping me look more closely at the real problem :P
[21:47:01] <mikeyyz> (I was applying the CSS for opacity/zindex to the input.file in css and not directly to an #id, so JQM was overriding all my css)
[21:47:21] <jailbot> hello?
[21:47:39] <Velveeta> ahhhh gotcha
[21:47:50] <Velveeta> i was just applying it to the form element itself
[21:48:11] <jailbot> i'm trying to delay an animation
[21:48:19] <jailbot> what function is good for that
[21:48:30] <jailbot> well in a hover function
[21:48:32] <Velveeta> `api delay @jailbot
[21:48:32] <b-ot> jailbot: .delay(): Set a timer to delay execution of subsequent items in the queue. http://api.jquery.com/delay/
[21:49:02] <jailbot> yeah that doesnt work
[21:49:08] <jailbot> one sec ill send source
[21:49:17] <Velveeta> throw together a jsfiddle example and i'll see what i can do
[21:49:28] <jailbot> hammr.co/5116630/10
[21:49:42] <jailbot> look at the "work" section
[21:49:54] <mikeyyz> Is there a way to tell JQM to not apply styles to that particular <input> at all?
[21:50:06] <jailbot> im using a sass grid to set the width
[21:50:23] <Velveeta> mikeyyz: not to my knowledge, but i'm not overly familiar w/ jqmobile
[21:50:47] <jailbot> so I want to grab the width on mousein
[21:50:54] <Velveeta> jailbot: i'm not gonna go digging through the js of your page, take a chunk of it and put it into a jsfiddle example please
[21:51:59] <jailbot> jez fine
[21:51:59] <jailbot> my js is like 20 lines but whatever
[21:52:33] <Velveeta> considering that's the standard modus operandi of this room, "put together a jsfiddle example", i don't feel unreasonable saying the same thing to you
[21:52:40] <jailbot> no its not
[21:52:45] <jailbot> i was a jerk sorry
[21:52:47] <Velveeta> but since i'm about ot head to bed anyway, i could always just say good luck
[21:53:09] <Velveeta> ok, so i have about 7 minutes or so
[21:54:24] <jailbot> so the width of the element is determined at load
[21:54:24] <jailbot> on hover in it grabs the width
[21:54:24] <jailbot> sets the width to 100%
[21:56:55] <jailbot> and then on mouse out it sets the width back to $width
[21:56:55] <jailbot> well do you see it on the page?
[21:56:55] <jailbot> I just want to stop the flickering
[21:57:11] <Velveeta> yes i see it on the page, but i have no idea what the code looks like
[21:57:18] <Velveeta> that's what i'm trying to get you to post me an example of
[22:00:43] <jailbot> jsfiddle sucks
[22:01:00] <Velveeta> no, not really..
[22:01:21] <Velveeta> but feel free to use the live demo site of your own preference
[22:01:24] <Uhkis> jsfiddle actually rocks :-)
[22:01:34] <Velveeta> jsbin is another good one
[22:03:31] <jailbot> ummm codepen?
[22:03:48] <Velveeta> it really doesn't matter so long as it's an interactive demo
[22:03:50] <tw2113> i like jsbin
[22:03:55] <jailbot> ok man
[22:04:22] <tw2113> i think part of my preference for jsbin is browser claustrophobia
[22:04:38] <Uhkis> this jsbin actually seems better
[22:07:50] <Velveeta> ok, well it's been 15 minutes since i asked for a demo example, and i said i only had 7 to hang around, so i'm out, hopefully tw or uhkis can help you out
[22:07:52] <tw2113> both get the job done
[22:07:56] <Velveeta> adios people
[22:08:09] <blaster3> c
[22:09:57] <blaster3> hi. I'm writing my first jquery plugin.
[22:10:15] <blaster3> I've managed to get it to chain methods, but why can't I make it work with delay?
[22:10:29] <blaster3> http://jsfiddle.net/L9JEg/
[22:10:57] <jailbot> http://cdpn.io/cuLpo
[22:11:01] <blaster3> http://jsfiddle.net/L9JEg/1/
[22:11:58] <jailbot> here it is
[22:11:58] <jailbot> http://cdpn.io/cuLpo
[22:11:58] <jailbot> spam out on the img
[22:11:58] <jailbot> it takes the new width before the old width is restored
[22:12:17] <Velveeta> jailbot: are you trying to make it delay 300ms *before* setting the width to 100%?
[22:14:15] <jailbot> it sets the new width
[22:14:15] <jailbot> i need something like .delay()
[22:14:15] <jailbot> no after
[22:14:58] <Velveeta> ok, so after it sets the width to 100%, then when, on mouseleave, you want it to wait 300ms and then set the width back?
[22:16:24] <jailbot> well if you leave, it start to set it back to 30%
[22:16:34] <Velveeta> jailbot: so, something like this? http://codepen.io/bigrayarea/pen/cuLpo
[22:16:46] <Velveeta> damnit, hold on, that didn't save my edits
[22:16:46] <jailbot> but if you enter again when the width is 50% it sets the return width to 50%
[22:17:04] <Velveeta> there we go: http://codepen.io/anon/pen/pxijg
[22:17:13] <Velveeta> oh i gotcha
[22:17:22] <blaster3> http://jsfiddle.net/L9JEg/1/
[22:17:24] <Velveeta> so if you mouse back over while the width is in transition
[22:17:29] <blaster3> how can I make a delay in execution of my plugin
[22:17:30] <blaster3> ??
[22:17:33] <Velveeta> ok, i think i can correct that
[22:17:44] <Velveeta> blaster3: i'll show you in just a minute, you have some scope issues going on
[22:17:51] <jailbot> and then its no good
[22:18:20] <Velveeta> jailbot: here you go: http://codepen.io/anon/pen/pxijg
[22:18:35] <Velveeta> you need to assign width in such a way that it only assigns its value on the first time around
[22:19:02] <Velveeta> so when width is null (1st execution) it will resort to using $(this).css('width');, and everytime thereafter, will use that value that's been previously assigned
[22:19:23] <Velveeta> you'll probably want to isolate that scope also, in case you have something similar going on elsewhere, like this:
[22:19:54] <Velveeta> http://codepen.io/anon/pen/pxijg
[22:20:30] <tw2113> oh no! i ate Velveeta's cousin
[22:20:36] <Uhkis> codepen.io doesn't want to save your changes
[22:20:56] <jailbot> why does that work?
[22:21:45] <tw2113> sorry Velveeta i ate your cousin Pepperjack
[22:22:08] <Velveeta> blaster3: here you go: http://jsfiddle.net/L9JEg/2/
[22:22:38] <jailbot> did you fork it
[22:22:38] <jailbot> ahhh, thank you very much sir!
[22:22:38] <jailbot> one quick thing
[22:22:38] <jailbot> when you trigger the hover a whole bunch
[22:22:38] <jailbot> it glitches as it processes all the animations
[22:22:46] <Velveeta> right
[22:23:21] <Velveeta> you can try inserting some .stop() calls to kill the animation queue in your callbacks
[22:23:34] <jailbot> is there any way to stop that
[22:23:34] <jailbot> someone once told me .stop() but idk
[22:23:36] <Velveeta> but otherwise, that's just a side effect of doing something like that and mousing over and out a lot
[22:24:36] <Velveeta> jailbot: here's an example using stop() http://codepen.io/anon/pen/pxijg
[22:25:04] <jailbot> isnt that a common behavior?
[22:25:04] <jailbot> what would I target for .stop
[22:25:34] <Velveeta> you would just target the element that you're targeting with your animation queue
[22:25:37] <jailbot> ok great! thank you so much
[22:25:37] <jailbot> saved the day
[22:25:40] <Velveeta> no problemo
[22:25:58] <Velveeta> fortunately for you, my wife decided to stay up another half hour, and so i did too :D
[22:25:58] <jailbot> yeah I put it after the animate call
[22:25:58] <jailbot> and it broke
[22:26:25] <Velveeta> yeah you want to stop the current animation queue first, and then add on your animation, so stop comes first in that line
[22:26:34] <jailbot> so I was like screw it
[22:26:34] <jailbot> haha awesome
[22:26:34] <jailbot> +1 Velveeta
[22:26:47] <Velveeta> tw2113: pepperjack is a homewrecker, it's better off that you ate that lying bastard
[22:26:59] <tw2113> just checking
[22:27:22] <Velveeta> tw2113: have you ever heard ween's song "buenos tardes amigo" ?
[22:28:36] <tw2113> yes
[22:28:39] <Velveeta> if you haven't, it's about another relative homewrecker, you should totally give it a listen if you have 7 minutes to kill: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpHWDFyNF-s
[22:28:43] <tw2113> but i don't know the meaning for the lyrics
[22:28:44] <Velveeta> well then, you know :D
[22:28:59] <tw2113> i like piss up a rope
[22:29:02] <Velveeta> dude, there's only like 3 spanish words in the song, and they're the title :D
[22:29:21] <tw2113> never listened that closely either, obviously
[22:29:26] <tw2113> i thought you were going somewhere
[22:29:35] <Velveeta> nope, relative homewreckers made me think of it
[22:29:41] <Velveeta> it's about a guy that kills his own brother
[22:29:45] <Velveeta> because everybody liked him better
[22:32:21] <Velveeta> ok, buenos noches amigos… stay thirsty, my friends
[22:32:43] <jailbot> gnite
[22:32:43] <jailbot> thanks again
[22:56:38] <blaster3> Velveeta: how do I make it so that the methods are chainable and the delay still works
[23:00:48] <blaster3> Need something like this: http://jsfiddle.net/L9JEg/3/
[23:01:20] <blaster3> my plugin should be able to delay the script for a set ammount of time, and it should be chainable
[23:03:25] <blaster3> so far I made the script delay
[23:03:32] <blaster3> but it's not chainable
[23:24:25] <miCSu> How should jquery ui sortable's cancel method be used? It doesn't seem to cancel the last drop by returning element to original position
[23:24:36] <miCSu> also keep getting "Uncaught TypeError: Cannot call method 'removeChild' of null"
[23:41:01] <bigbugjava> Hi, I just cant seem to get what Jquery blueimp wants in the return, look at the tries, notice that the "files" is fixed to what API says plugin is expacted!... Fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/RxKAm/
