[04:03:17] <UnfixedSNIPERJ> hey guys is there a way to undestroy selectable?
[04:03:53] <UnfixedSNIPERJ> i can use selectable, but in order to allow it to be draggable i have to destroy selectable... unless there is a better way (im sure there is)
[08:57:21] <UnfixedSNIPERJ> Hey guys, I am trying to make selectable work with draggable, here is my fiddle https://jsfiddle.net/UnfixedSNIPERJ/3gggh6bg/5/
[08:58:14] <UnfixedSNIPERJ> when i select a row draggable works, but if i unselect it and select a different row, the other rows that were previously selected are still draggable
[08:58:17] <UnfixedSNIPERJ> any ideas?
[08:59:23] <UnfixedSNIPERJ> i noticed that the ui-draggable class remains even when ui-selected is removed when deselected, could that be part of the problem?
[09:04:51] <php916> hey there

[09:56:12] <Azrael_-> hi
[11:45:14] <n00bZn> hi all
[11:46:09] <n00bZn> I'm using the jquery datatable plugin and i'm trying to customize a few options. What I'm attempting to do is change the background of the table heading when sorting is selected on a column
[11:46:17] <n00bZn> my jsbin is here :
[11:46:25] <n00bZn> http://live.datatables.net/sagefome/1/edit
[11:47:01] <n00bZn> the problem is that my colum header only changes the background color highlight on the click and it doesnt remain afterwards
[11:53:48] <b|ackwolf> I declared some variables inside $.read() but they're not accessible through page (specifically Chrome Developer Console)
[11:54:20] <b|ackwolf> why is that happening?
[12:16:50] <tocka> hi guys... im not sure why but i cant select the next li element after the one which has .active class
[12:16:53] <tocka> could someone help? https://jsfiddle.net/u5dtgzzo/2/
[12:18:24] <shoky_> tocka: because .next() only finds sibling elements (that share the same direct parent), and your .active <li> doesn't have any next siblings
[12:18:39] <tocka> I see..
[12:18:57] <tocka> What would be the best way to get the next element then? If there is a next element (li) that is :o
[12:21:13] <shoky_> i'd give a class to all direct children of .sidebar-menu and then you can do  $('.active').closest('.thatclass').next()   or something like that
[12:23:01] <arc_> interesting. i wouldn't have thought of that
[12:24:30] <arc_> i'm not sure that will work though
[12:25:40] <shoky_> if there can be more <ul>s then he'd need to check if .next() returned a <ul> or a <li>
[12:26:00] <arc_> i was thinking of adding a class and using index() and eq() but idk if that's a bad idea for some reason
[12:27:29] <shoky_> yea that can work too
[12:36:32] <tocka> thanks shoky_
[12:36:32] <tocka> :)
[14:30:21] <vvllbb> hello
[14:50:06] <garethdaine> Folks, how would I go about (on an event firing) taking the current position of a cursor in a textbox and selecting all text on that line between any spaces?
[14:53:38] <Cork> garethdaine: when do you want this?
[14:53:46] <Cork> as the user types, or clicks or what?
[14:55:33] <garethdaine> Well, basically, in my markdown editor when someone type ![Image Name]() in the preview on the right a placeholder image now shows combined with a file upload. The user clicks the placeholder, selects and image and then it uploads to the server and returns the image path. I’d like to take the returned data and replace ![Image Name]() with ![Image Name](path) Cork
[14:56:27] <Cork> that didn't answer the question
[14:56:41] <Cork> WHEN do you want to make the search
[14:56:51] <garethdaine> Basically, when the response fro the server is successful
[14:57:12] <Cork> ok, so no event then
[14:57:19] <garethdaine> Just trying to think of the best way to do it, and I thought using jquery to select ![Image Name]() and make a copy, as the input changes
[14:57:31] <Cork> what you need to do is grab the current selection object from the textarea
[14:57:42] <garethdaine> Then when the response is successful, search the text box for and replace
[14:57:42] <Cork> how you do this differs from browser to browser
[14:58:03] <Cork> from there you can get the character offset for the caret
[14:58:22] <Cork> and from that you get where in the string to search for the text
[14:59:05] <garethdaine> OK, thanks, though the text being searched for will be different each time
[15:02:28] <garethdaine> So, $(‘textarea’).prop(‘selectionStart’) would get the current position of the cursor?
[15:02:58] <Cork> no, like i said it differs between browsers
[15:03:23] <Cork> you need two solutions for it to work reliably
[15:03:37] <Cork> (google it there are plenty of examples around)
[15:04:01] <garethdaine> OK, will do, thanks. I’m only supporting modern browsers with this app
[15:22:08] <UnfixedSNIPERJ> Hey guys, I am trying to make selectable work with draggable, here is my fiddle https://jsfiddle.net/UnfixedSNIPERJ/3gggh6bg/5/
[15:22:16] <UnfixedSNIPERJ> when i select a row draggable works, but if i unselect it and select a different row, the other rows that were previously selected are still draggable
[15:22:21] <UnfixedSNIPERJ> i noticed that the ui-draggable class remains even when ui-selected is removed when deselected, could that be part of the problem?
[15:22:25] <UnfixedSNIPERJ> any ideas?

[17:38:02] <jonez> UnfixedSNIPERJ, I do not have any ideas about it.
[17:38:24] <UnfixedSNIPERJ> :/
[17:38:35] <UnfixedSNIPERJ> ya this one has been bugging me for a while
[17:54:00] <UnfixedSNIPERJ> I also put it up on stack: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/37244029/selectable-work-with-draggable
[18:21:59] <dhs111> hi, im trying to make a div change color on a hover event, when i use the .hover it work as intended until i remove some of the divs with the selected class and add new ones, the hover event isnt called any more
[18:22:23] <dhs111> i have tried using the .on method but that doesnt work at all
[18:22:39] <dhs111> https://jsfiddle.net/z3abjxyw/
[18:24:46] <dhs111> hello?
[18:25:50] <dhs111> is anyone here?

[18:42:51] <D-rex> UnfixedSNIPERJ: what are you trying to do?
[18:43:41] <UnfixedSNIPERJ> Select table rows and then drag a helper
[18:44:08] <UnfixedSNIPERJ> it works fine, however if I unselect a table row, and select a different one the last one i selected is still draggable
[18:44:22] <UnfixedSNIPERJ> i only want the current .ui-selectable to be draggable
[18:44:54] <UnfixedSNIPERJ> for some reason draggable isnt resetting when a different row(s) is selected
[19:03:57] <D-rex> UnfixedSNIPERJ: see if that works http://pastebin.com/EPdj1kEj
[19:06:21] <UnfixedSNIPERJ> D-rex, it does, thank you so much :D
[19:06:35] <UnfixedSNIPERJ> I tried to destroy option before, but i must not have used it properly
[19:06:50] <UnfixedSNIPERJ> You just solved a day long headache!
[19:08:24] <D-rex> yay!
[22:35:25] <takelong> is it possible for an iframe's height to change when a link inside the iframe is clicked?
[22:44:21] <D-rex> is the iframe local or remote?
[22:44:28] <D-rex> the src
[22:47:26] <takelong> D-rex, its remote.
[22:47:47] <takelong> basically, we have this wordpress site. and the iframe was placed somewhere else
[22:53:32] <D-rex> takelong: not possible for a remote src
[22:58:55] <arc_> that is one of the weirdest functionality requests i have seen in here
