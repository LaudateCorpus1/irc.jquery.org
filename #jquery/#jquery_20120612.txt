[00:04:13] <Whirl3d> gawd, I hate Comcast. LOL
[00:09:41] <fRAiLtY-> Rovanion:  I'm using Magento and one of the biggest problems I have is MySQL communication on this new platform, so technically the website loads, but loads an error page, I wonder how I could check for this as thinking about it, it's always likely to load, just more a case of *what* it loads. It's either the homepage or an error page if it cannot connect to MySQL
[00:18:23] <_helpPlz_> .quit
[00:18:34] <Rovanion> fRAiLtY-: Run a diff on a page that you've retrived against one that you've saved from before: https://github.com/Rovanion/BostadsBotten/blob/master/bostad.sh
[00:19:34] <fRAiLtY-> Rovanion:  Sorry how do you mean?
[00:19:38] <Rovanion> fRAiLtY-: If you just install postfix in debian/ubuntu this script should work.
[00:20:44] <Rovanion> fRAiLtY-: First you download the page when it works to a file, then in a cron job you run the script I linked. It checks if the newly downloaded version of the page is the same as the one retrieved before.
[00:22:31] <Rovanion> fRAiLtY-: If the old file and the newly downloaded file don't match, it will send an email.
[00:23:21] <Rovanion> fRAiLtY-: In the script, ingalagenheter is the name of the old file.
[00:26:23] <jarrylar> hello. i want to override $.width() to cache the width. can i just replace $.fn.width()?
[00:26:23] <skylamer`> yes
[00:26:23] <jarrylar> is there an easy way to get into the initiation of a jquery object?
[00:26:46] <jarrylar> if i override $, how do i call "super"?
[00:36:38] <Whirl3d> $.prototype maybe?
[00:37:31] <letweet> is anyone here familiar with lightbox? My images aren't loading in the "expanded" preview, and I think that may be because the SRC attribute for the image points to an aspx page that I'm using to render the image out of the database
[00:38:41] <letweet> strangely though, I can't replicate this problem locally, but, clicking on the thumbnail at portfolio.netgendns.co.za will show you what I'm talking about
[00:39:51] <vinayak> How to select a "p" inside "span#show_hide_text"?  $("#show_hide_text p").hide(); this is giving null
[00:40:09] <letweet> why are you putting a p inside a span?
[00:40:24] <systemfault> drugs :D
[00:40:27] <letweet> lol
[00:40:41] <vinayak> Not my code, someone elses'
[00:40:48] <letweet> -_-
[00:40:58] <letweet> tell that someone else to learn something about html
[00:40:59] <systemfault> vinayak: Your selector is good
[00:41:09] <vinayak> okay
[00:41:24] <vinayak> okay, so should i change it to div?
[00:41:36] <letweet> that would be my suggestion
[00:41:40] <systemfault> vinayak: You're sure the element exists when you call hide?
[00:41:47] <vinayak> let me try
[00:41:59] <systemfault> vinayak: I'd be surprised if change the span to a div would do anything.
[00:42:01] <vinayak> systemfault, yes
[00:42:09] <systemfault> browsers are good at handling shit markup
[00:42:14] <systemfault> Ah :'(
[00:42:15] <vinayak> i can see the html output
[00:42:34] <letweet> systemfault, true, that probably isn't the cause of the problem, but is sure as hell can't hurt haha
[00:42:48] <systemfault> vinayak: Can you give us a url?
[00:43:09] <systemfault> letweet:  :P
[00:43:21] <vinayak> no, because I am working on locally duplicated code
[00:43:31] <systemfault> I see
[00:43:38] <letweet> jsfiddle?
[00:43:57] <vinayak> wait
[00:44:41] <systemfault> vinayak: http://jsfiddle.net/KAh97/
[00:44:50] <letweet> systemfault, http://portfolio.netgendns.co.za ... the thumbnail click brings up lightbox okay, but for some reason the image doesn't load, think you could take a look?
[00:45:19] <Luffha> hi....how do i check if jquery is active on a page?
[00:45:31] <Luffha> with a simple command on console or so.
[00:46:17] <ENQ> use ready?
[00:46:20] <Luffha> got it ;) $('p');
[00:46:27] <systemfault> letweet: because you don't understand how it works :/
[00:46:48] <systemfault> letweet: How does it know what image to load if your <a> doesn't have a href?
[00:46:54] <ENQ> Luffha, there could be other framework with $ shorthand
[00:47:10] <Luffha> ENQ: ...so how can i do it best?
[00:47:21] <ENQ> idk what you need
[00:47:29] <systemfault> ENQ: $ is just an alias to jQuery
[00:47:35] <systemfault> So.. check for jQuery
[00:47:35] <ENQ> yep
[00:47:41] <systemfault> Ahhh
[00:47:59] <systemfault> OOps .. sorry ENQ, I thought for a second that you had the problem
[00:48:27] <ENQ> i had in past, was wondering what a heck is thet weird symbol
[00:50:16] <vinayak> systemfault, in jsfiddle it seems to be working correct. maybe i am not calling jscript at right place, i am adding <script> right after last div in jsfiddle
[00:51:40] <systemfault> vinayak: That's a possibility, you might be calling .hide() before the span is created
[00:52:04] <vinayak> ah, so should i add it in head
[00:52:09] <systemfault> You could wrap the code in a "ready" event
[00:53:18] <vinayak> $(document).ready();?
[00:53:50] <ENQ> if your script is after <span> then span should be created in DOM
[00:54:00] <Eshu> i want to update the td text between the range http://jsfiddle.net/rkumar670/ZPuHy/3/
[00:54:14] <systemfault> vinayak: Yeah
[00:55:50] <EniGMistA> hi :)
[00:57:00] <EniGMistA> why $('#testo div span[style="color: #0000ff"]').each( function() {.....  selector doesn't work? Where is the mistake?
[00:57:20] <vinayak> systemfault, Object #<HTMLDocument> has no method 'ready' :( What am I doing wrong?
[00:58:02] <Eshu> systemfault: please look into my question  i want to update the td text between the range http://jsfiddle.net/rkumar670/ZPuHy/3/
[00:58:06] <systemfault> vinayak: $(document).ready(function() { code here}); and not document.ready
[00:58:30] <vinayak> i did that only, let me clear the cache
[01:03:16] <vinayak> systemfault, still not working, btw, e = document.getElementById("show_hide_text"); $(e).hide(); is working, but i need to hide the "p" (except first) under show_hide_text
[01:03:38] <letweet> systemfault I added an href for the link (haven't uploaded) but now it doesn't even bother with lightbox, it just redirects to the image
[01:03:52] <skylamer`> u can add some class, vinayak
[01:03:53] <skylamer`> to the first
[01:04:08] <skylamer`> then $("p:not(".first")").hide()
[01:04:46] <systemfault> letweet: I did it myself by adding an href attribute on the <a> and it worked flawlessly.
[01:05:24] <vinayak> skylamer`, can i do something like $("#something p:not(".first")").hide(); ?
[01:06:35] <vinayak> oh, i can't add class in p, it is external to my code
[01:06:42] <MrTool> hi there, can anyone help me with a strange non error trigger on a .getJSON Request if the File doesnt exists / internet connection failed
[01:09:47] <vinayak> can i combine "p" tag with e? e = document.getElementById("show_hide_text"); $(e).hide();
[01:11:24] <systemfault> Why would you use getElementById?
[01:12:03] <vinayak> because i tested it , it is working
[01:12:12] <Cork> vinayak: $('p').add(e).hide()
[01:12:12] <vinayak> it is able to hide the stuff
[01:12:21] <Cork> vinayak: though its a waist to do that
[01:12:44] <Cork> vinayak: just do $('#show_hide_text, p').hide()
[01:13:04] <skylamer`> уьсясшш waiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiisssttt
[01:13:06] <skylamer`> : P P P
[01:13:22] <vinayak> Cork, wouldn't that select all ids, and p?
[01:13:30] <Cork> sure
[01:13:31] <Cork> uh
[01:13:33] <Cork> no not all
[01:13:35] <Cork> the id and p
[01:13:39] <Cork> id is uniq
[01:13:42] <klawd_prime> hi!
[01:13:43] <Cork> so you can always only find one
[01:13:45] <vinayak> p inside id?
[01:13:52] <klawd_prime> is there a way to get the currently selected tab?
[01:13:55] <Cork> ah, thats another matter
[01:14:01] <Cork> vinayak: just do $('#show_hide_text p').hide()
[01:14:31] <Cork> klawd_prime: in jquery-ui tab you mean?
[01:14:36] <vinayak> Cork, ha ha this is the problem, this is saying can't call hide on null
[01:14:49] <Cork> then use jQuery
[01:14:55] <Cork> $ is prob prototype or something
[01:15:01] <skylamer`> в
[01:15:08] <Cork> then use jQuery('#show_hide_text p').hide()
[01:15:09] <skylamer`> ook more in to ur dev cdonsole., vinyak ;)
[01:15:12] <klawd_prime> yes Cork
[01:15:17] <vinayak> might be...
[01:15:27] <Julien> hello
[01:15:52] <Julien> $(document).on("click", '.ui-widget-overlay',  function() { $("#dialog").dialog("close"); });
[01:15:55] <Cork> klawd_prime: .ui-tabs-selected
[01:16:09] <Cork> klawd_prime: just select on the class
[01:16:15] <klawd_prime> ok
[01:16:18] <Julien> this is for init "live" event", but haow can i use the 'off' now to kill this event ?
[01:16:34] <Cork> vinayak: jquery never EVER returns null
[01:16:51] <Cork> vinayak: so if you get null from $() it's not jquery
[01:17:25] <vinayak> Cork, Thanks a ton man, you solved the problem :)
[01:17:43] <vinayak> nice thing to remember
[01:17:46] <Cork> vinayak: sounds like you prob should clean up your code base
[01:18:00] <Cork> your using native js, and two frameworks on the same pace
[01:18:01] <Cork> *page
[01:18:13] <systemfault> o_O
[01:18:16] <systemfault> No wonder.
[01:18:35] <vinayak> ah i have no control over it, it's under Magento
[01:18:43] <klawd_prime> Cork: .tabs('option', 'selected')
[01:19:23] <Julien> one again how could i kill , using 'off' method the following event :
[01:19:28] <Julien> $(document).on("click", '.ui-widget-overlay',  function() {
[01:19:28] <Julien> 	 $("#dialog").dialog("close"); });
[01:19:32] <Julien> ?
[01:20:02] <Julien> should i write $(document).on("click", '.ui-widget-overlay')  ???
[01:20:15] <Julien> arf shiot
[01:20:30] <Julien> should i use : $(document).off("click", '.ui-widget-overlay'
[01:20:38] <systemfault> TIAS?
[01:20:39] <skylamer`> kill wbhat?
[01:20:51] <shoky> murderer!
[01:21:11] <Julien> kill the live evnt ! :)
[01:21:22] <shoky> wat's dat
[01:21:47] <Julien>  $(document).on("click", '.ui-widget-overlay',  function() { $("#dialog").dialog("close"); });
[01:21:52] <shoky> ?
[01:21:53] <Julien> this is a live event ...
[01:21:59] <shoky> if u say so
[01:22:00] <klawd_prime> can i easily bind a click and a change to the same function?
[01:22:09] <shoky> klawd_prime: easily
[01:22:32] <Julien> shoky: you don't know this syntax ?
[01:22:34] <shoky> klawd_prime: give your function a name
[01:22:34] <jagjr> Hi guys - How can i store a pages div content into a mysql database with jquery?
[01:22:37] <shoky> Julien: sure do
[01:22:45] <klawd_prime> hm.
[01:22:47] <klawd_prime> ok
[01:23:01] <systemfault> Julien: Why don't you try what you said before?
[01:23:01] <Julien> hshohaw do you use the off method in this case ????
[01:23:12] <shoky> Julien: did you try ?
[01:23:23] <Julien> because i want to be sure to do the rightest way ...
[01:23:31] <shoky> ok it's the rightest.
[01:23:39] <Julien> :) THANKS
[01:23:40] <systemfault> It's the most most rightest
[01:23:41] <shoky> ;D
[01:23:54] <Julien> :D have a nice day guys
[01:23:59] <shoky> u2sir
[01:24:43] <systemfault> jagjr: You hire someone that takes a look at the page… then write the content in the DB on the command line
[01:25:06] <letweet> writes the content in the db on command line? -_-
[01:25:12] <shoky> how else?!?!
[01:25:15] <letweet> I'd rather develop a UI that it
[01:25:24] <shoky> that's so much work
[01:25:29] <shoky> especially with jquery
[01:25:46] <letweet> why use jquery to access a db? doesn't seem very efficient
[01:25:56] <shoky> doesn't seem very possible either
[01:25:56] <systemfault> letweet: It doesn't...
[01:26:11] <systemfault> letweet: You create a server-side service that you call with jQuery.
[01:26:31] <letweet> that works too, but I've never thought of doing it
[01:26:48] <letweet> systemfault, know any tutorials on basic concept for that?
[01:27:02] <letweet> might streamline my blogging engine some more
[01:27:34] <systemfault> letweet: Any PHP/mySQL tutorial will show you how to do it (Not that I personally like PHP)
[01:28:26] <skylamer`> use mongodb mongolab api :) u can do a nice things with it
[01:29:08] <systemfault> It might be better off for him to start with a classic RDBMS, no?
[01:29:28] <peiper> does someone have a little ajax snippet with success etc. etc. included?
[01:29:32] <shoky> access plz
[01:29:46] <systemfault> peiper: If you want snippets.. just use google..
[01:29:54] <systemfault> peiper: If you really have a question, ask :)
[01:30:02] <shoky> peiper: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/dcpbr/
[01:30:35] <vinayak> Can i combine multiple .show() and .hide(), so as to make sliding up/down effect?
[01:30:49] <Posterdati> hi
[01:30:54] <skylamer`> vinayak toglle() ?
[01:31:00] <Posterdati> please I need to make an svg clickable
[01:31:15] <peiper> Posterdati .live ?
[01:31:24] <Whirl3d> wow, really? I mean really? wow
[01:31:34] <MrTool> what is the best practise of error detection with an jsonp request if the internet connection is lost? I got some Problems with my local terminal app
[01:32:00] <Posterdati> peiper: what is it?
[01:32:26] <systemfault> MrTool: JSONP is a hack, I don't think you have control on that.
[01:32:50] <systemfault> (I might be wrong)
[01:32:55] <shoky> Posterdati: maybe try http://keith-wood.name/svg.html
[01:33:28] <Posterdati> shoky: I followed that...
[01:33:38] <systemfault> MrTool: Perhaps you could manually add a timeout.. and do something if it happens.
[01:34:15] <MrTool> ow, kay i saw this on stackoverflow, but it doesn't look like an "clean" workaround
[01:34:54] <MrTool> but thank you systemfault i would try this
[01:35:10] <systemfault> MrTool: JSONP isn't ajax, it's adding a script tag to the head of your document.. (An ugly hack)
[01:35:19] <systemfault> MrTool: So your possibilites are very limited
[01:36:26] <MrTool> i was not able to load an json file from a crossdomain using .ajax in chrome
[01:36:35] <MrTool> in that case i had to use jsonp
[01:36:56] <systemfault> MrTool: I understand
[01:37:15] <systemfault> MrTool: If you only need to support newer browsers, perhaps you could use CORS.
[01:37:47] <MrTool> at the current state it only supports Chrome
[01:37:59] <MrTool> but in the future it should also run on IE
[01:38:17] <MrTool> unfortunately
[01:38:19] <MrTool> ...
[01:38:20] <loostro> hello, I have a problem with jQuery DataTables  -> http://datatables.net/api (fnGetData function)
[01:38:22] <loostro> I did var tableData = rolesDT.fnGetData ( myRow); .. where rolesDT = $(selector).datatables(); object
[01:38:26] <loostro> the problem is, the function returns an array.. but when i try to loop through it and alert its contents I get no results!
[01:38:54] <loostro> console.log( jQuery.type(tableData) )   returns "array"
[01:39:17] <loostro> console.log( tableData );    -> in the console i see pairs of key = value
[01:40:00] <loostro> but when i do $.each(tableData, function(key, value){ console.log ( key + ': ' + value ); }) ;  i get nothing
[01:40:16] <systemfault> loostro: Is it really an array? Or an array in the retarded PHP sense?
[01:40:34] <systemfault> loostro: are the keys numbers?
[01:40:36] <peiper> php is awesome :(
[01:40:37] <loostro> it should be an OBJECT (assosiative array)
[01:40:58] <systemfault> peiper: Only if you don't know anything else.
[01:41:06] <superchu> php != awesome
[01:41:12] <superchu> c# is
[01:41:21] <systemfault> C# rocks
[01:41:27] <peiper> okay go ahead and program a forum in c# ?
[01:41:38] <systemfault> peiper: No problem bro.
[01:41:47] <systemfault> peiper: I would if I wanted..
[01:41:57] <peiper> congratz running a windows server ^^
[01:42:11] <systemfault> peiper: I'm just judging the language.
[01:42:16] <systemfault> I'm no MS guy.
[01:42:31] <peiper> u are if u prefer web development with c# :D
[01:42:42] <superchu> C# and .net is way better than php
[01:42:45] <loostro> for(var index in tableData) {       console.log( index + " : " + tableData[index]);       }   - works
[01:42:47] <loostro> $.each(tableData, function(key, value) {     console.log ( key + ': ' + value ); }) - does not work.... WHY?
[01:42:47] <Bauer> guys, I have this jquery command not working: $("#error__Phone").val("bitch"); and the element is: <div class="widgetErrorMessage" id="error__Phone">ערך אינו יכול להישאר ריק</div>
[01:42:52] <Bauer> why is this not working?
[01:42:53] <peiper> how can u guys even compare those 0.o
[01:43:27] <peiper> Bauer, why are u using .val? try .html instead
[01:43:28] <superchu> peiper: http://me.veekun.com/blog/2012/04/09/php-a-fractal-of-bad-design/
[01:43:41] <shoky> Bauer, or .text(...)
[01:43:58] <Bauer> peiper: ok will try, BUT why would .val NOT work? val with a text value as parameter acts as a setter
[01:43:58] <systemfault> Bauer: .val is only for form elements
[01:44:14] <shoky> Bauer: it only sets the value attribute of the element, not its contents
[01:44:23] <superchu> Bauer: val-works with form-elements like <input>
[01:44:26] <shoky> mevin?!
[01:44:30] <superchu> it refers to value
[01:44:38] <superchu> witch doesn't exist on <div>
[01:44:44] <Bauer> ahhhh, thanks :) missed that on the docs page
[01:44:48] <superchu> :)
[01:47:11] <superchu> peiper: C# as a language is way better than php and .NET as a platform makes pwns every php-framework i've worked with.
[01:47:21] <superchu> -makes..
[01:47:24] <peiper> well superchu from that blog
[01:47:33] <superchu> but i guess it's down to the developer to decide
[01:47:49] <peiper> PHP is full of surprises -> which noob uses real_escape_string? mysqli prepared statements ftw!
[01:47:49] <superchu> i used to be a php-developer
[01:48:02] <superchu> peiper: ofc
[01:48:14] <peiper> php is opaque: no stak traces etc. etc. -> i use XDebug great error reporting and stack tracing
[01:48:46] <peiper> that its flaky thats true (had some weird stuff with references in foreach loops) though its not that bad evey one is telling
[01:49:17] <systemfault> peiper: PDO?
[01:49:22] <superchu> phps lack of real oop is a big head-ache for me
[01:49:35] <superchu> and no hard types
[01:49:44] <systemfault> peiper: If you had used a real language before.. you would know what a stacktrace is..
[01:49:48] <peiper> no mysqli prepared statements i avoid PDO drivers since they arent supported on every weberver
[01:50:09] <superchu> well, you want to use a ORM anyway
[01:50:16] <systemfault> No you don't.
[01:50:25] <systemfault> I'll never touch an ORM again of my life.
[01:50:31] <systemfault> Not with a 10 foot pole.
[01:50:33] <superchu> haha
[01:50:42] <superchu> data layer -> business layer -> application layer
[01:50:51] <superchu> anywho, this is a jquery-channel
[01:50:52] <superchu> :D
[01:51:04] <systemfault> superchu: ORMs always leak into your business layer..
[01:51:14] <systemfault> superchu: That's one of the reasons why I hate the,
[01:51:16] <systemfault> *them
[01:51:48] <shoky> omg no stack traces in php , i gotta learn that shit
[01:52:20] <superchu> why would you not want stack traces...
[01:52:27] <shoky> </sarcasm>
[01:54:01] <systemfault> I miss doing backend dev...
[01:54:03] <shoky> systemfault what kinda leakage do you mean?
[01:54:25] <NodeX> Applications leak as much as the developer wrote them to
[01:54:29] <shoky> (i have very little experience with ORM)
[01:54:35] <NodeX> you cannot blame a language for that
[01:54:47] <shoky> ORM ain't a language but ok
[01:54:57] <systemfault> shoky: Example.. for hibernate, you MUST have a default constructor on all classes. (Why would I want one?) You must have getters and setters for all your business objects...
[01:55:23] <systemfault> shoky: When A piece of software dictates how your business layer should behave, it's a fail.
[01:55:24] <NodeX> ORM sucks
[01:56:00] <systemfault> That's why ORMs are not liked in the DDD community….
[01:56:03] <Guest2193> hi there
[01:56:13] <shoky> gotcha
[01:56:27] <Guest2193> first time here
[01:56:33] <NodeX> wth is the "DDD" community ?
[01:56:44] <systemfault> And with the newer architectural patterns like CQRS+ES.. you can have a event stream and avoid the whole ORM problem.
[01:56:52] <systemfault> NodeX: Domain-Driven Design
[01:57:35] <NodeX> another buzz word that will fade and die I imagine
[01:57:54] <systemfault> Well.. it's not something you need for a basic PHP application..
[01:58:13] <systemfault> But when you need to handle a lot of complexity.. it helps a lot.
[01:58:16] <NodeX> I dont write them so I am safe
[01:58:36] <systemfault> :)
[01:58:56] <superchu> systemfault: I dont know much 'bout CQRS. But lets say you have a system wich stores about.. 500GB of data.. how would you handle that event-stream with CQRS?
[01:59:19] <superchu> wouldn't you need to mount it somewhere in order to do queries to it..?
[01:59:30] <NodeX> alot of these problems that these wonderful acronyms aim to solve can be solved by writing a cleaner objective and abstracting alot better
[01:59:43] <Posterdati> I did a simple html + jquery page, how can I force the browser to reload changed documents?
[02:00:23] <systemfault> superchu: you have snapshots that represents a state at a certain moment.. (Of course, the delay between snapshots depends on your specific domain)
[02:01:02] <superchu> yeah, i know that. But let's say that my system stores huge amount of data
[02:01:18] <NodeX> http://domaindrivendesign.org/library/dahan_2010    <--- is that the basic gist of it ?
[02:01:44] <systemfault> NodeX: You should get familar with DDD before CQRS imho.
[02:02:09] <NodeX> CQRS is err kinda obvious
[02:02:13] <systemfault> superchu: It really depends on your particular problem
[02:02:19] <NodeX> I've always written code like this - from day one
[02:02:23] <superchu> systemfault: we have a developer here who is looking at CQRS and running som tests
[02:02:23] <shoky> systemfault: i've just begun reading about it. but CQRS seems to be to be exactly how i would handle using an ORM
[02:03:06] <systemfault> superchu: I never had the chance to completely implement it so far… (It sucks.. :'( )
[02:03:33] <superchu> systemfault: and it seems really cool being able to rollback to a certain point in time. but it will be difficult converting our application to use it..
[02:03:38] <NodeX> Alot of these scenarios come from using software not designed for large data
[02:03:52] <NodeX> take the software out of the equation and you lose the problem all together
[02:04:18] <systemfault> NodeX: CQS at a architectual level is not an old idea...
[02:04:35] <NodeX> I didn't say it was
[02:04:59] <NodeX> but it's main uses are for large data on slow systems it seems and getting round the problems created by it
[02:05:46] <superchu> systemfault: what is your proffession?
[02:05:58] <systemfault> superchu: Web developer :/
[02:06:15] <systemfault> superchu: You?
[02:06:40] <superchu> UI/UX developer
[02:06:50] <systemfault> Cool :)
[02:06:50] <superchu> but i do some system development as well
[02:06:57] <systemfault> You have design skills? :P
[02:07:02] <systemfault> I totally don't..
[02:07:14] <superchu> yeah, atleast im told so.. ^^
[02:07:31] <systemfault> I not bad at frontend… as long as you give me a mockup or something
[02:07:35] <systemfault> I'm
[02:07:43] <superchu> I work at a company that develops and sells a system for project management
[02:07:52] <superchu> So performance is key
[02:08:00] <systemfault> Great :)
[02:08:01] <NodeX> performance is always key!
[02:08:07] <NodeX> UI comes secondary
[02:08:10] <systemfault> NodeX: More or less :P
[02:08:15] <superchu> NodeX: true dat
[02:08:29] <systemfault> NodeX: Why is there so much PHP if performance is important? :P
[02:08:30] <Whirl3d> unless you are dealing with artists or attorneys.
[02:08:39] <Whirl3d> They care more about how it looks than how it operates
[02:08:43] <superchu> ^^
[02:08:51] <NodeX> I think it was amazon that did a study that if they shaved off even 500ms form a page load i turned into an extra million bucks a year in sales
[02:09:12] <NodeX> systemfault : my PHP performs very well
[02:09:16] <systemfault> NodeX: I think so, sure not if it was them but I read something saying that before.
[02:09:28] <systemfault> NodeX: Impossible.
[02:09:29] <NodeX> in every langauge you have peeople that can't write performant code
[02:09:31] <NodeX> lmfao
[02:09:33] <NodeX> how so
[02:09:38] <systemfault> NodeX: PHP is just… slow.
[02:09:44] <NodeX> cool story
[02:09:49] <NodeX> care to back it up ?
[02:10:02] <NodeX> my php apps handle 10,000 req/s without breaking a sweat
[02:10:04] <systemfault> I don't need to back up the obvious….
[02:10:09] <systemfault> caching is the key..
[02:10:09] <superchu> some weeks ago i took a look at an old javascript some developer wrote a couple of years ago
[02:10:26] <systemfault> And most websites are I/O bound.. not CPU bound
[02:10:31] <superchu> it took 13 seconds in IE7 to execute and change data in a HUGE table in the browser
[02:10:42] <superchu> we're talking 1000 rows + 8 cells each
[02:10:55] <superchu> rewrote the thing from ground up.. now it takes .7 seconds :)
[02:10:56] <superchu> in IE7
[02:11:06] <NodeX> I have 10gbps for my sites so the bottleneck is infact the CPU
[02:11:07] <systemfault> superchu: Haha, his code was probably causing tons of reflows :P
[02:11:19] <systemfault> NodeX: Then PHP is now your problem :P
[02:11:31] <NodeX> I fail to see how
[02:11:36] <superchu> systemfault: each cell registered a javascript telling a "global-listener" it exists..
[02:11:55] <systemfault> PHP is slow as hell… just google for some benchmarks....
[02:12:04] <superchu> so when you looked at the generated source-code you would see a tree of javascript buliding up dependencies beteween cells
[02:12:08] <NodeX> I dont need to google, I have real life benchmarks in my apps lol
[02:12:12] <systemfault> It's so slow that facebook decided to write their own PHP compiler..
[02:12:30] <NodeX> FB serve alot of people from thier PHP
[02:12:36] <systemfault> superchu: Wow
[02:12:53] <systemfault> NodeX: Even Javascript is a lot faster than PHP nowadays..
[02:13:01] <superchu> systemfault: nedless to say, that guy doesn't work here anymore :D
[02:13:03] <systemfault> By a few orders of magnitudes.
[02:13:11] <NodeX> again.. depends on the PHP
[02:13:15] <systemfault> No it doesn't.
[02:13:22] <NodeX> ok lol
[02:13:46] <NodeX> if you're comparing to things like drupal/wordpress/joomla then you're correct
[02:13:47] <systemfault> Even if your code is as fast as it can be at the algorithmic level… you're still fucked by the bad implementation.
[02:13:51] <NodeX> but they are examples of BAD php
[02:13:54] <superchu> systemfault, NodeX: i guess php is ok when you develop regular websites and small applications
[02:14:01] <systemfault> superchu: I agree
[02:14:06] <superchu> but for huge business application it just doesn't scale
[02:14:11] <NodeX> I develop fast, high traffic websites and it's fine
[02:14:12] <NodeX> lol
[02:14:22] <systemfault> superchu: Indeed.
[02:14:31] <NodeX> how does it not scale ?
[02:14:51] <NodeX> everything scales horizontaly
[02:15:04] <systemfault> NodeX: Only in a perfect world.
[02:15:09] <NodeX> how so
[02:15:15] <NodeX> all my apps scale orrizontaly
[02:15:17] <NodeX> +h
[02:15:20] <superchu> facebook have some extremely talented people.. but they wrote their own compiler.. 'cause it was to damn slow..
[02:15:30] <systemfault> NodeX: Then you have basic apps..
[02:15:33] <NodeX> slow for a billion req/s yes
[02:15:38] <NodeX> systemfault lol
[02:15:38] <superchu> NodeX: i suppose you're not running apache then?
[02:15:44] <superchu> nginx?
[02:15:45] <NodeX> No I am not running apache
[02:15:51] <NodeX> nginx
[02:15:56] <superchu> thats cool
[02:15:57] <NodeX> no mysql
[02:16:02] <systemfault> NodeX: Your websites are probably 99% reads then… easy to cache.
[02:16:08] <systemfault> That's why you get performance.
[02:16:14] <NodeX> no bloated frameworks
[02:16:33] <systemfault> In more complex domains, you have a lot more writes.. concurrency… you cannot scale as easily.
[02:16:38] <NodeX> I like the assumptions systemfault
[02:16:50] <NodeX> how can you not scale ?
[02:16:57] <superchu> Well, im not saying its impossible to write high performance applications in PHP
[02:17:02] <NodeX> you keep blurting out these amazing pearls of wisdom
[02:17:13] <superchu> but it's sure isn't built for it in the first place
[02:17:14] <NodeX> yet you can't explain why ...
[02:17:45] <systemfault> NodeX: Not sure what I should explain to you to be honest..
[02:18:00] <NodeX> superchu : it depends on 1 your php app and 2 how you're php/env is compiled and setup
[02:18:10] <NodeX> how PHP doesnt scale for one
[02:18:17] <ENQ> problem is that busnis need guarantees, and opensource usualy not providing it, thats way alot busnis apps is not php
[02:18:45] <NodeX> +1
[02:19:23] <systemfault> NodeX: Slow.. no application scope.. you get bitten by the dynamic typing… the language overall is shit...
[02:19:35] <NodeX> to you it is
[02:19:41] <systemfault> It just is..
[02:19:51] <NodeX> but to me it scales fine because I take these things into acocunt when I write the apps
[02:20:06] <systemfault> Anyone can scale a 2 users application.
[02:20:13] <NodeX> yet another assumption
[02:20:30] <youngin> Hey
[02:21:05] <superchu> systemfault: you're still asuming he's writing small business applications. It's not impossible to build huge applications in php.. but i prefer building them in a language/framework wich gives me hard typing, real OOP, stacktraces etc
[02:21:09] <superchu> but its really down to the developer
[02:21:30] <NodeX> ^^ taken into account when writing the app ;)
[02:21:33] <superchu> C#/.NET costs a lot of money
[02:21:41] <systemfault> superchu: If he did write a non-trivial application, he would have seen the shortcomings of PHP already.
[02:21:48] <systemfault> He did not.
[02:21:54] <NodeX> systemfault : I do love your assumptions
[02:22:03] <youngin> What's that thing called where you can drag this button on this line, i.e. -------||------------- into ---------------||----?
[02:22:11] <NodeX> again: 10,000 req/s is not a trivial App
[02:22:13] <systemfault> superchu: Also, he's saying that the PHP interpreter is performant… it's not.
[02:22:25] <superchu> youngin: range-selector..?
[02:22:36] <youngin> superchu: ah, thank you so much man
[02:22:37] <systemfault> Even shit benchmarks on the language shooting shows  that PHP is just slow.
[02:22:44] <systemfault> *shootout
[02:22:54] <NodeX> systemfault : you evidently do not have a clue what you're talking about and just want to join the age old "hate php because you can't write code" bandwagon
[02:23:22] <NodeX> that's cool bro, you keep on hating and I'll keep making money writing "slow" apps in a bad language
[02:23:26] <NodeX> ;)
[02:23:39] <systemfault> NodeX: I also write PHP … idiot.
[02:23:39] <superchu> :)
[02:23:42] <systemfault> :)
[02:23:42] <ENQ> there is some ppl who grabs one language and do everything with it, and there is no other tools
[02:23:49] <NodeX> you're a scrub kid lol
[02:24:04] <systemfault> It's just that I've seen more than PHP in my life :)
[02:24:12] <youngin> systemfault: thats what happens when you treat people like shit bro
[02:24:15] <NodeX> I didn't say it was the fastest retard
[02:24:16] <systemfault> So i can actually judge.
[02:24:31] <NodeX> You can't judge a thing because you don't write large apps kid
[02:24:33] <systemfault> NodeX: I didn't say it was the slowest… ruby is worse for exmaple.
[02:24:34] <superchu> NodeX: Well I develop C# at work and some php on my sparetime.. and i prefer C# and Visual Studio as a development environment
[02:24:38] <superchu> but its really down to the developer
[02:24:47] <mikkelb> php aint shit compared to ruby
[02:24:51] <superchu> i think compiled code > interpreted
[02:24:56] <mikkelb> but ofcourse
[02:25:23] <mikkelb> if you've spent all your life learning php, ofcourse you're gonna start getting defensive when a better programming language comes around
[02:25:28] <systemfault> mikkelb: I agree, ruby is just slower though (Even if the language is a million times more elegant)
[02:25:33] <ENQ> well, then what language is considared fast and good?
[02:25:41] <NodeX> I am not defensive, I believe in the right tool for the job
[02:25:46] <mikkelb> well
[02:25:47] <systemfault> NodeX: Same.
[02:25:47] <superchu> ENQ: assembler..?
[02:25:52] <ENQ> lol
[02:25:53] <mikkelb> afaik ruby used to be slow, now its quite fast
[02:25:59] <mathewrapid> hey hey hey guys, why the hating? more lovin' please ^_^
[02:26:13] <NodeX> but slating PHP because you write BAD php code and can't get it to perform well does not mean that PHP is all bad
[02:26:16] <superchu> didn't twitter use ruby for front-end but then decided to switch to php for performance..?
[02:26:29] <NodeX> twitter use python iirc
[02:26:40] <systemfault> superchu: twitter use ruby and scala iirc
[02:26:49] <NodeX> scala on the backend
[02:26:56] <NodeX> python on the front end
[02:26:58] <superchu> but not ruby anymore, right?
[02:27:17] <systemfault> superchu: I don't know.. it started full ruby though
[02:27:43] <systemfault> The ruby community cried the day they changed their message queue to scala
[02:27:56] <systemfault> (I remember the threads in forums)
[02:28:08] <youngin> Hey, does anybody here take on jobs?
[02:28:39] <superchu> I love how we discuess server-languages in a jquery-channel
[02:28:39] <superchu> ^^
[02:28:42] <NodeX> lol
[02:28:48] <NodeX> it's the4 age old debatre
[02:28:53] <NodeX> next it will be PC vs MAC
[02:28:56] <superchu> oh
[02:29:01] <superchu> don't go there
[02:29:17] <systemfault> vim vs emacs?
[02:29:22] <superchu> so, were you guys from?
[02:29:23] <mathewrapid> loooool
[02:29:26] <shoky> ttt
[02:29:27] <mathewrapid> Finland
[02:29:35] <systemfault> Canada
[02:29:39] <superchu> Sweden here
[02:30:03] <shoky> israel?
[02:30:07] <ruby_on_tails> Mars
[02:30:09] <ENQ> best country in the world
[02:30:13] <Vooloo> is it possible to inject a javascript from another site that pops up a dialog like this: http://jqueryui.com/demos/dialog/#default ?
[02:30:15] <mikkelb> Emacs excels at things like bidirectional communications with co-operating processes, which is good for embedding things in (or marrying things to) the editor, like a shell, a REPL or a debugger. Who the fuck needs that though?
[02:30:21] <systemfault> ENQ: Mars? Yeah !
[02:30:33] <ruby_on_tails> YEAH!!
[02:30:42] <mikkelb> Vim has the best text editing interface - period. And with https://github.com/altercation/vim-colors-solarized shit just got mad sexy
[02:30:46] <ENQ> Vooloo, possible
[02:30:47] <NodeX> uk
[02:31:04] <mikkelb> youngin: What sorta job you offering?
[02:31:26] <systemfault> mikkelb: I love solarized, I was using underwater before :D
[02:31:39] <youngin> I just need some scripts man no biggie
[02:31:42] <systemfault> I also used zenburn for a while..
[02:31:49] <shoky> $_$
[02:31:55] <mikkelb> you tried asking systemfault?
[02:32:02] <systemfault> Why me? :(
[02:32:12] <ruby_on_tails> anyone would like to beta test my application and write some tutorial style codes ?
[02:32:13] <shoky> --> systemfault <--
[02:32:14] <youngin> mikkelb: Yeah, he was too busy though
[02:32:32] <mikkelb> youngin: And yet he's in here all day every day talking? That can't be right
[02:32:35] <systemfault> I'm always too busy… except when I wake up at 3am. :/
[02:32:40] <shoky> what application is that, ruby_on_tails
[02:32:50] <ruby_on_tails> shoky: http://thecodeplayer.com
[02:33:11] <shoky> ew, metro style
[02:33:24] <Vooloo> ENQ: does site need to include jquery first, or can the script that is injected include jquery itself? and what happends if jquery is already included once?
[02:34:14] <systemfault> shoky: People will be forced to swallow Metro :P
[02:34:25] <ENQ> Vooloo, you can use dynamic lybrary loaders, still you should load jquery one time
[02:34:46] <Vooloo> ENQ: right, but I don't know if the site already did or not
[02:35:07] <shoky> systemfault: it's fugly and for smartphone people. leave my desktop alone :(
[02:35:20] * shoky hates smartphones
[02:35:25] <ruby_on_tails> what does metro style mean ?
[02:35:25] <systemfault> shoky: I also think it's a touch-only interface
[02:35:44] <shoky> ruby_on_tails: exactly the style of your main page. BOXES.
[02:35:50] <systemfault> ruby_on_tails: 2d.. tile-based (À la windows 8)
[02:35:59] <ruby_on_tails> ok
[02:36:07] <skylamer`> METRO IMMERSIVE WINDOWS INTERFACE COOL VERY MUCH GOOD!
[02:36:09] <ENQ> Vooloo, if jquery isnt there your code wount work :)
[02:36:12] <skylamer`> :D)
[02:36:12] <shoky> the player app looks cute though
[02:36:15] <shoky> @ ruby_on_tails
[02:36:26] <ruby_on_tails> hmm
[02:36:51] <systemfault> The CSS player is cool :)
[02:37:03] <systemfault> s/CSS/code
[02:38:12] <joshauh> hello, just wondering if someone could take a look at this for me... and suggest what is the best way to make it all fit into one row? http://www.promptlawncare.com.au/Our-Services
[02:38:14] <youngin> nobody able to take on this scripting job?
[02:38:28] <youngin> the pay is good i guess
[02:38:34] <Vooloo> using a modal window and having a form in it doing a POST, the actual request is done by the browser right?
[02:38:36] <mikkelb> systemfault: come on man help the dude out
[02:38:48] <joshauh> not sure if i should make font smaller? or make button smaller? or ?
[02:38:48] <systemfault> mikkelb: I'm leaving soon…
[02:39:00] <systemfault> mikkelb: Help him :D You're the man
[02:39:03] <mikkelb> systemfault: Yeah but you'll be back
[02:39:06] <mikkelb> I mean you're always here so
[02:39:40] <ruby_on_tails> hmm
[02:40:28] <ruby_on_tails> so i will open up the editor for the code player, i am still working on a pastebin style easy editor feature that requires no headache to type in code
[02:40:44] <systemfault> mikkelb: I suck at jQuery
[02:41:11] <superchu> jQuery is easy
[02:41:17] <NodeX> ruby_on_tails : that's a pretty nice site - nice idea and well implemented
[02:41:27] <systemfault> superchu: I'll get better with time ;)

[02:44:40] <NodeX> alot of lol's
[02:44:46] <systemfault> You'd get… 199 lols :/

[02:48:24] <superchu> well
[02:48:27] <superchu> it's time for lunch
[02:48:28] <superchu> bbl
[02:49:15] <Vooloo> anyone know a modal window that has a top header bar, an X, can interact with background and can include iframe?
[02:49:30] <Vooloo> and dragable
[02:50:06] <ruby_on_tails> Vooloo: make a div, add a header, put an X, center it, put a black BG behind it, you will have what you want
[02:50:30] <Vooloo> how do I get the iframe?
[02:50:47] <ruby_on_tails> just put the iframe in that div ?
[02:50:50] <shoky> ya ruby_on_tails: sweet app
[02:50:51] <Vooloo> this needs to be injected on a third party site
[02:51:19] <ruby_on_tails> you cant do that without that site's permission i guess ?
[02:51:30] <ruby_on_tails> shoky: thanks
[02:51:36] <Vooloo> no of course... they just add <script> and then I need to get the magic done
[02:52:04] <ruby_on_tails> you know what, i have been thinking of doing something similar with my app, where people can embed the walkthroughs on their sites like youtube videos
[02:52:18] <ruby_on_tails> but i have till now, no clue how to do that =)
[02:52:36] <NodeX> iframe ftw!
[02:52:54] <Vooloo> I can get fancybox to include an iframe, but it doesn't have dragable header and interaction with background when opened
[02:52:54] <ruby_on_tails> Vooloo: i think there should be a script which loads another big script that would inject the html structure for the popup you want with an iframe
[02:53:42] <systemfault> Vooloo: What is "interaction with the background"?
[02:54:03] <Vooloo> http://jqueryui.com/demos/dialog/#default <- like this, dialog open, but you can type stuff in textarea
[02:54:28] <systemfault> Ahh, not modal
[02:54:52] <systemfault> You could probably do it with fancybox with a bit of styling
[02:54:54] <ruby_on_tails> Vooloo: just use jquery UI
[02:55:29] <systemfault> Only the draggable part is problematic with fancybox
[02:55:38] <ruby_on_tails> you already have everything you want it it
[02:57:17] <joshauh> when working with the demo provided by jquery for "tabs" what CSS controls the text size of the actual tab???
[02:57:23] <joshauh> i cant seem to work that part out...
[02:58:17] <ruby_on_tails> joshauh: its the jquery ui css
[02:58:33] <ruby_on_tails> inspect the element in firebug/devtools and it will show the stylesheet it comes from
[02:58:35] <Vooloo> ruby_on_tails: not iframe
[02:58:48] <ruby_on_tails> Vooloo: i guess you can put an iframe in the jquery ui popup
[02:59:18] <Vooloo> guess? :P
[02:59:54] <ruby_on_tails> ruby_on_tails: i have used iframes in jquery ui popups
[03:00:03] <ruby_on_tails> infact multiple iframes
[03:00:09] <Vooloo> you mean the dialog?
[03:00:12] <ruby_on_tails> yes
[03:00:20] <ruby_on_tails> dialog, popup, modal whatever
[03:00:27] <Vooloo> how? there is nothing in the docs
[03:00:57] <ruby_on_tails> you can put anything in a div and apply modal to it
[03:01:02] <ruby_on_tails> .dialog();
[03:01:14] <ruby_on_tails> put an iframe in a div and apply .dialog(); done
[03:01:32] <Vooloo> so <script> calls a page, that has a div with an iframe and .dialog() on it?
[03:01:50] <Vooloo> and that will popup on the site?
[03:02:06] <ruby_on_tails> that site will hit you, for loading jquery ui, iframes, etc
[03:02:18] <ruby_on_tails> thats bad to load so much js on a third party site
[03:02:23] <ruby_on_tails> it will slow them down i guess
[03:03:05] <Vooloo> should jquery be loaded before my site or inside my site..
[03:03:05] <NodeX> alot of it will be cached by the client
[03:03:22] <NodeX> certainly if you use google's javascript api's
[03:03:51] <ruby_on_tails> not sure
[03:04:03] <Vooloo> this is included in their site: <script type="text/javascript" src="https://mysite.com/mywidget/?key=123"></script> ... and on mywidget/ I run the div, the iframe and the dialog?
[03:04:06] <ruby_on_tails> i havent worked on 3rd party api js code style stuff
[03:05:50] <shoky> ruby_on_tails: and you managed to leave the code simple and readable. kudos
[03:06:19] <ruby_on_tails> shoky: they are editable too, you can pause the thing and start playing with the code with realtime changes
[03:06:26] <ruby_on_tails> or after the WT is complete
[03:06:37] <shoky> yeah i saw, i meant YOUR code ;)
[03:06:40] <shoky> as in view-source
[03:06:40] <shoky> ;p
[03:07:14] <ruby_on_tails> dont steal my code =;
[03:07:17] <ruby_on_tails> :P
[03:07:25] <shoky> my br0wser did it ;S
[03:07:34] <youngin> Anybody wanna rewrite http://www.professorcloud.com/mainsite/cloud-zoom.htm for me? (is too big and messy - will pay)
[03:07:36] <ruby_on_tails> because its so horrible, you would shout at me =)
[03:07:57] <shoky> heh i liked the // COOL TRICK BRO
[03:08:11] <ruby_on_tails> ?
[03:08:21] * youngin is now playing: http://home.no/mritz/mrender1.mp3
[03:08:30] <shoky> jq_ob.removeClass('included').click(); // COOL TRICK BRO ;)
[03:08:42] <nanovirus> holla, have a mare with jqueryui datepicker on a single page, works fine on others.  It just opens and closes straight away (in a modal) and in a non-modal version of the page, it won't even open.  Any ideas as to what could cause this?
[03:08:53] <ruby_on_tails> oh lol, that code is my teammate's
[03:09:13] <shoky> ohh you're a team
[03:10:07] <ruby_on_tails> sort of
[03:10:17] <ruby_on_tails> i took the codebase of a jsfiddle type site and used that
[03:10:35] * youngin is now playing: http://home.no/mritz/bts_2006.mp3
[03:11:09] <shoky> ya there's a resemblance to jsbin
[03:13:38] <heatxsink> is there a definitive library for edit in place on jquery? there seems to be a ton of implementations but not a common one everyone uses
[03:13:41] <shoky> nanovirus: try jsfiddling it
[03:13:54] <nanovirus> shoky, ok, give me a sec
[03:15:04] <ENQ> i have a question about plugin
[03:15:19] <ENQ> should i pass jquery object as this? or DOM element to closure
[03:15:30] <ENQ> callback
[03:16:36] <nanovirus> shoky, http://jsfiddle.net/7Qw4W/
[03:17:31] <nanovirus> is the datepicker supposed to launch on jsfiddle when you tick the jqueryui checkbox?  Not tried it before
[03:24:34] <nFFF> When the mouse enters the bottom half of the screen and continues down, I want the page to scroll down
[03:24:54] <nFFF> Any native event property to track this, or will I have to compare two mousemove values?
[03:25:18] <sacho> clientY + scrollY
[03:26:57] <nFFF> scrollY?
[03:27:08] <sacho> scrollltop()
[03:27:12] <sacho> -l
[03:27:42] <nFFF> yea that doesnt help
[03:27:54] <nFFF> that just gives your your scrollbar offset
[03:28:05] <sacho> ..
[03:29:18] <nFFF> if (e.offsetY > window.height()/2)
[03:33:30] <Bauer> guys I have this piece of code working perfectly in Chrome: http://jsfiddle.net/yxxRe/ however, in IE, the highlight function setSelectionRange(0,1) seems to work ONLY if the user uses Tab to trigger a focus-out event. If he uses mouse click into another text box, highlight and even focus is not working
[03:35:17] <Whirl3d> is focusout new?
[03:35:24] <Whirl3d> ? .focusout
[03:35:24] <bot-t> .focusout(handler): Bind an event handler to the "focusout" JavaScript event. http://api.jquery.com/focusout/
[03:35:31] <shoky> nanovirus you also need to include the css. but you're not even calling .datepicker() ...
[03:35:32] <Whirl3d> hmmm
[03:35:35] <Whirl3d> ? .blur
[03:35:35] <bot-t> .blur(handler): Bind an event handler to the "blur" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/blur/
[03:37:10] <Bauer> any idea about my problem with setSelectionRange(0,1) ?
[03:39:07] <sacho> seems like it doesn't work with chrome either
[03:41:22] <Bauer> sacho: why do you say that? revised html code: http://jsfiddle.net/yxxRe/6/ click just below the text box after writing 02 for example
[03:41:30] <Bauer> in Chrome it will re-focus and highlight 0
[03:41:41] <Bauer> in IE, the behaviour is unpredictable
[03:41:45] <sacho> mine doesn't
[03:41:57] <Bauer> really? hmmm what version of chrome?
[03:42:00] <sacho> http://jsfiddle.net/yxxRe/9/
[03:42:06] <sacho> seems like a timing problem
[03:43:24] <timing> I think the problem is sacho related
[03:43:42] <sacho> Bauer, works in IE too now http://jsfiddle.net/yxxRe/13/
[03:43:48] <Bauer> what do you mean sacho? your console.log also outputs .. and then ... when I focusout in chrome
[03:43:48] <sacho> had to remove the console.logs
[03:44:07] <thomedy> what im trying to do is set my jquery animation to a variable and then running.stop(var) to quit that animation based on a condition
[03:44:13] <thomedy> is that possible
[03:44:41] <sacho> hmm
[03:45:10] <sacho> stop() doesn't remove a particular item from the queue
[03:45:16] <sacho> it only stops the current animation
[03:45:47] <Bauer> sacho: seems to work indeed, but what did you do? I fail to see any difference in code :S
[03:45:54] <sacho> the setTimeout..
[03:46:21] <thomedy> sacho any recommendations
[03:46:26] <Bauer> what? I dont follow...
[03:47:11] <Bauer> ohh I see now sacho, but who calls that function?
[03:47:59] <thomedy> i couldn't think of the queue one.. but i remembered it was clearque so then i was able to google it
[03:48:04] <thomedy> and i might have found a solution
[03:48:45] <sacho> clearQueue will remove the whole queue
[03:49:00] <thomedy> http://api.jquery.com/clearQueue/
[03:49:11] <thomedy> i was reading tha tit looks like i can clear a queu on just a div
[03:49:11] <sacho> not just a particular animation
[03:49:14] <thomedy> i might be wrong
[03:49:21] <sacho> um
[03:49:25] <thomedy> i was just scanning first
[03:49:27] <sacho> all queues are for a particular element
[03:49:47] <sacho> it's not just one animation queue, for example
[03:50:04] <thomedy> the animation is for a particular div so it should be fine
[03:50:06] <thomedy> here..
[03:50:09] <thomedy> www.thesartorer.com
[03:50:32] <thomedy> if you slide that menu over on hover and then click on one of the links in the menu
[03:50:49] <Bauer> sacho: can you explain your setTimeout solution please?
[03:50:51] <thomedy> i want the links to stop sliding
[03:51:08] <sacho> Bauer, it executes your focus/selection code 100 milliseconds later
[03:52:46] <sacho> I don't know what exactly is messing up to cause your first function to not work
[03:52:52] <Bauer> sacho: why does it need to be executed 100ms later? and what calls this function? I only see you declared the function, but what executes it?
[03:53:29] <sacho> setTimeout does
[03:54:39] <Bauer> sacho: ok, but how did you figure out the problem was timing related and the solution had to be this? just so I know how to troubleshoot similar stuff in the future
[03:56:03] <sacho> I guessed
[03:56:42] <sacho> since focus and focusout are closely related
[03:57:06] <sacho> I thought the event was focusing you out after your focus+selection code
[03:57:15] <sacho> but a preventDefault() didn't fix it so I dunno
[03:57:39] <Bauer> ahhh, interesting... this is why I try to avoid working on front end stuff :)
[03:57:44] <Bauer> thanks!
[04:00:44] <thomedy> okay im not sure what to do here
[04:00:57] <thomedy> i need to cut a specific animation
[04:03:47] <heatxsink> so there is no definitive jquery edit-inline library?
[04:10:14] <drcable> Hey, I'm having some trouble with .load , I've been reading docs and a couple of tutorials/blog posts, but I can't find what I'm doing wrong. My code is here: http://jsfiddle.net/Dg4Na/ Please could anyone point out my error, or link me to somewhere explaining my mistake?
[04:10:35] <letweet> what does your console say?
[04:12:31] <nanovirus> shoky, yeah dude, I realised, sorted it... thanks!
[04:13:10] <drcable> Ah, thanks. made a stupid mistake- It's taking the "absolute" url as a "relitive on, and trying to "GET http://fiddle.jshell.net/_display/www.textfiles.com/anarchy/001.txt"
[04:14:13] <sacho> thomedy, you can get the queue for a particular element via $(el).queue()
[04:14:16] <Cork> drcable: fyi, thats a full url, not an absolute one
[04:14:31] <Cork> /anarchy/001.txt is an absolute url
[04:14:39] <letweet> drcable have a look at this http://jsfiddle.net/Dg4Na/1/
[04:14:44] <sacho> I don't know if there is any specific mechanism to remove things from the queue though
[04:15:06] <letweet> you may have to click "Run" at the top
[04:15:07] <sacho> besides the front
[04:15:14] <Cork> ?.clearQueue @ sacho
[04:15:14] <bot-t> sacho, .clearQueue([queueName]): Remove from the queue all items that have not yet been run. http://api.jquery.com/clearQueue/
[04:15:31] <sacho> no
[04:15:49] <thomedy> i did that
[04:15:55] <thomedy> and found it isn't the queue that im clearning
[04:15:57] <thomedy> clearing
[04:16:04] <thomedy> in fact my clear is empty
[04:16:06] <thomedy> im silly
[04:16:11] <thomedy> in stead im unbinding the event
[04:16:17] <thomedy> and that makes way more sense
[04:16:35] <superchu> yeah.. the coke machine at work is getting dangerous
[04:16:59] <thomedy> and it totally worked
[04:17:53] <ruby_on_tails> shoky: stole all my code ? :P
[04:18:05] <drcable> Cork, Thanks. letweet ; that's giving me a repeat of the same content (output reads: "old
[04:18:05] <drcable> old2
[04:18:06] <drcable> old
[04:18:06] <drcable> old2
[04:18:06] <drcable> "). Isn't a data- atribute better anyway?
[04:18:12] <drcable> gah. sorry.
[04:18:57] <letweet> strange... when I run it, I get this -> {"error": "Please use POST request"}
[04:19:31] <Cork> letweet: your using noscript?
[04:19:31] <systemfault> Then use a post request :D
[04:20:30] <Cork> letweet: jsfiddle uses xss to reload the iframe, and noscript blocks xss by default
[04:20:41] <needlz> i'd like to change the value of this input field: <input type="hidden" name="deleteItem" value="" />. I tried $("#deleteItem").change("hello"); but without success. Any idea why I'm doing wrong?
[04:20:41] <drcable> letweet, I'm getting that in Firefox, chromium, chromium no addons
[04:21:01] <letweet> Cork, I simply updated his fiddle and ran my changes...
[04:21:12] <letweet> don't know anything about noscript here
[04:21:13] <needlz> what*
[04:21:21] <sacho> needlz, don't guess what functions do based on their name, look up api.jquery.com
[04:21:30] <sacho> in your case, you want val()
[04:21:31] <Cork> needlz: $('input[name="deleteItem"]').val('hello')
[04:21:38] <letweet> needlz, try $("#deleteItem").value("hello");
[04:21:49] <letweet> or .val should work
[04:21:52] <Cork> nope value is dom
[04:22:02] <sacho> and yes, you can't match a name with #
[04:22:50] <needlz> thank you all, $('input[name="deleteItem"]').val('hello') worked :)
[04:23:37] <shoky> ruby_on_tails: yes
[04:23:47] * letweet would love to know why php forms don't work if you don't use the deprecated name attribute for text input :/
[04:24:13] <Cork> letweet: name on form elements isn't depricated
[04:24:23] <Cork> letweet: its depricated on links but not form elements
[04:25:15] <Cork> letweet: if you don't have a name on the input field, theres no key for the form to send the data on
[04:25:33] <Flo0815> hi guys
[04:25:41] <shoky> but..but.. php!
[04:26:01] <Cork> (it has nothing to do with php)
[04:26:06] <shoky> !!
[04:27:08] <letweet> Cork, but why not make it work on either name or id ?
[04:27:19] <Flo0815> can someone help me please. I have a button "delete user". when the user clicks on it, it should show a custom designed confirm box. Is it possbile to declare it all within the eventhandler for the click event? like $('#el').click(function(){ showConfirmBox(); if(confirmBox == true) do s.th else do sth else});
[04:27:23] <letweet> I mean... people who are big into xhtml validation won't want name attributes everywhere
[04:27:34] <shoky> wat
[04:27:38] <Cork> letweet: cause id is meant for dom refernece, not form submition
[04:27:55] <superchu> letweet: the name-attributes on form elements are used as keys for the HTTP-Post collection
[04:28:04] <superchu> it has nothing to do with php, xhtml or jquery..
[04:28:16] <shoky> Flo0815: that's really not enough info for us to help you
[04:28:27] <NodeX> Flo0815 : your code needs to be synchronous ... somehting like click(function() { if(showConfirmBox()) {....
[04:28:42] <Flo0815> what u mean by synchronous
[04:28:47] <NodeX> PHP is fast - true story
[04:28:50] <NodeX> lol
[04:28:54] <superchu> NodeX: <3
[04:29:31] <NodeX> lmao
[04:29:55] <NodeX> Flo0815 : synchronous meaning it waits for a response before continuing
[04:30:23] <systemfault> Flo0815, the quick answer is.. you can't unless you use the built-in dialogs
[04:30:42] <Flo0815> hm
[04:30:55] <Flo0815> but i could do it with callbacks
[04:31:01] <NodeX> you can but your showConfirmBox() function needs to be written properly
[04:31:02] <systemfault> Flo0815, That would work
[04:31:16] <Flo0815> i'll try with callbacks thx
[04:31:35] <NodeX> that's an overkill
[04:31:52] <systemfault> NodeX, can't you go back at coding PHP instead of misleading people?
[04:31:57] <shoky> ;)
[04:32:17] <NodeX> systemfault : no
[04:32:19] <thomedy> i have an odd effect tha tim getting that is undoubtedly due to my retarded
[04:32:19] <sacho> you could use deferred :D
[04:32:21] <NodeX> and I am not misleading
[04:32:23] <thomedy> www.thesartorer.com
[04:32:42] <thomedy> if you click on the link it does this double animation and its not really sticking
[04:32:50] <systemfault> thomedy, cute
[04:32:51] <thomedy> thats only half the wierd part
[04:32:55] <NodeX> you - admitted youself that you're bad at jQuery so perhaps let the people who know what they are talking about help others
[04:33:06] <thomedy> me>>>
[04:33:06] <systemfault> NodeX, at least, I admit it :)
[04:33:08] <thomedy> nodex
[04:33:23] <NodeX> whereas I dont need to admit it because I know what i am talking about kid ;)
[04:33:29] <thomedy> anyway.. i would love some tender advice
[04:33:38] <systemfault> NodeX, I'm doing my best to improve so I'll be as good as even.. shoky
[04:33:48] <systemfault> I'm not there yet.
[04:34:14] <NodeX> you will need to expand your concept of programming in general to improve - somehting I dont think your ego has the capacity for
[04:34:24] <thomedy> Im not either who wants to help
[04:34:38] <sacho> thomedy, what's the problem?
[04:34:47] <hooloovoo> no fighting kids
[04:34:49] <thomedy> www.thesartorer.com click any link
[04:34:53] <thomedy> it will slide open a page
[04:35:08] <sacho> yes?
[04:35:10] <NodeX> no fighting here, simply stating facts
[04:35:11] <thomedy> and youll notice that the menu does this crazy slide
[04:35:15] <thomedy> not right?
[04:35:25] <thomedy> but then on another slide men/women both have the sub menu
[04:35:37] <thomedy> the sub menu is where its supposed to be
[04:35:51] <thomedy> the goal is that when you click on a link the sub menu slides to 45% and then stays
[04:36:11] <sacho> do you mean that the submenu isn't moving the same as the page?
[04:36:14] <thomedy> i dont know why the one i click goes nuts and the one id dont submits
[04:36:37] <thomedy> well now im jus tnot sure what the question is
[04:37:08] <thomedy> i do not have each menu moving on the same animation because i dont want to see them all unless on that page
[04:37:11] <thomedy> is that the right answer
[04:38:34] <superchu> Flo0815: i would recommend a asynchronous solution with a callback.
[04:40:12] <jammsen> Hi Guys, whats wrong on: $('div#tabs-1 p').click(function(){ var inputdevice = $(this).find('input'); alert($(inputdevice).attr('checked')); ?
[04:40:37] <jammsen> i always get undefined, not true or false for the state of the checkbox :(
[04:40:53] <systemfault> jammsen, a missing } ?
[04:41:17] <systemfault> }); even
[04:41:20] <jammsen> the closing code is just not posted ^^
[04:41:21] <Cork> jammsen: and its inputdevice.prop('checked')
[04:41:26] <Cork> not attr
[04:41:28] <sacho> thomedy, if you mean the way the menu goes right then left
[04:41:31] <jammsen> i try that
[04:41:36] <sacho> thomedy,  it's because its container changes width
[04:41:39] <thomedy> yeah thats not right
[04:41:42] <superchu> jammsen: ditch the 'div' before #tabs-1
[04:41:44] <thomedy> well thats true
[04:41:47] <superchu> its not whats wrong
[04:41:49] <superchu> but ditch it
[04:42:17] <jammsen> i though its safer that way, my book told me that, o0 why can i drop it?
[04:42:26] <thomedy> but im trying to shift the menu left after a click so that it sits on the left side near the main heading and then all sub menus rest there from then on
[04:42:26] <Cork> jammsen: wait a min...
[04:42:37] <Cork> jammsen: you should prefix made up attributes
[04:42:44] <Cork> jammsen: call it data-checked instead
[04:42:50] <superchu> jamsen: you're doing an unnecessary selection on tagname when you already know the ID
[04:42:54] <superchu> the ID is unique per page
[04:43:07] <superchu> getElementByID is faster than getElementByTagName
[04:43:16] <jammsen> Cork: i dont get what you mean :(
[04:43:37] <Cork> jammsen: sorry, missed the inner selector
[04:44:00] <Cork> $('#tabs-1 p').click(function(){ var inputdevice = $(this).find('input'); alert(inputdevice.prop('checked')); }); should work
[04:44:41] <superchu> jammsen: unless you're filtering by class, then the tagname will make it faster
[04:45:59] <Flo0815> can someone look at this code please and tell me if i can improve s.th? thx http://jsfiddle.net/cFGX2/
[04:46:38] <jammsen> $('#tabs-1 p').click(function(){ if($(this).find('input').prop('checked')===false) { toggleTableRow(this,'on'); } else { toggleTableRow(this,'off'); } });
[04:46:59] <jammsen> works like a charm, thank you guys :)
[04:47:07] <thomedy> wtf?
[04:47:10] <thomedy> im so confused
[04:47:21] <jammsen> but whats the difference between prop and attr?
[04:47:26] <Cork> ?.prop
[04:47:27] <bot-t> .prop(propertyName): [New in v1.6] Get the value of a property for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/prop/
[04:47:29] <Cork> ?.attr
[04:47:30] <bot-t> .attr(attributeName): Get the value of an attribute for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/attr/
[04:47:44] <Cork> jammsen: .prop is the same as domElement.checked
[04:47:48] <thomedy> my prob is i dont know whats causing this
[04:47:53] <Cork> while attr only gets the value from the tag
[04:48:16] <Cork> jammsen: so attr won't update when the checkbox changes
[04:48:20] <Cork> while prop will
[04:48:25] <jammsen> ahhh, okay, i think i got it =)
[04:48:32] <jammsen> thanks a lot Cork
[04:48:42] <Cork> attr is defined if you mark it as checked in the html
[04:48:45] <Cork> npp
[04:48:47] <jammsen> one beer for Cork :)
[04:48:54] <Vooloo> can you change the size of jquery UI header of a dialog/modal or can you only change colors?
[04:48:56] <vmassuchetto> How can I pass variable keys for a method? e.g. $.ajax({data: { variable_thing: some_value } });
[04:49:16] <Cork> Vooloo: sure, its controlled by the css
[04:49:21] <systemfault> Flo0815, I'd personally be tempted to 1) use .on instead of the old .live function 2) Use a single callback and passing it the response (ok/cancel). Also, does it work? It doesn't refresh the page when you click on the buttons?
[04:49:58] <Flo0815> systemfault: no it doesn't. just doing an ajax call. i will use .on. forgot to change it
[04:49:58] <superchu> systemfault: his using console.log, check your console ;)
[04:50:04] <Cork> vmassuchetto: var data={}; data[variable] = value; $.ajax({data:data})
[04:50:04] <systemfault> vmassuchetto, you create an object var data = {}; then data[variable] = somevalue;
[04:50:11] <Flo0815> and yes it's working :)
[04:50:17] <systemfault> Flo0815, :)
[04:50:25] <vmassuchetto> systemfault, Cork : thanks
[04:50:30] <Flo0815> why would u use a single callback?
[04:50:46] <systemfault> Flo0815, I was saying that because the default behavior of a click on a button is to submit a form.
[04:50:56] <Flo0815> like i did it, i won't have to check the value every time
[04:50:58] <systemfault> Flo0815, Seems nicer to me, that's totally subjective
[04:51:01] <Flo0815> ok
[04:51:13] <Flo0815> there will be no form,
[04:51:33] <Flo0815> so the buttons will be replaced with designed div's
[04:51:45] <systemfault> Good :)
[04:51:59] <Flo0815> ok thanks for helping me
[04:52:01] <systemfault> You totally got it :)
[04:52:03] <Flo0815> :)
[04:52:05] <Flo0815> i hope :)
[04:52:41] <thomedy> okay i think i have an idea but i gotta go to work so your all amazing and i appreciate you guys so much
[04:54:54] <shoky> thomedy: setting overflow:hidden and background-color:#212121 on overflow-container , it looks a bit better ;p
[04:55:19] <thomedy> thats helpful thank you
[04:56:38] <thomedy> its a bandaid though
[04:56:39] <amcsi_work> hello
[04:56:45] <shoky> thomedy: also, try setting the first 'men' .overflow div to have 26% width instead of 25% and you'll see where that white flicker is coming from
[04:56:54] <amcsi_work> what templating library do you recommend for jQuery projects?
[04:57:01] <thomedy> thank you ill look at that
[04:57:08] <shoky> thomedy: because you floated the 4 main divs, and then the width is changing, the 4th div goes to the 'next line'
[04:57:12] <shoky> hmm
[04:57:18] <systemfault> amcsi_work, depending on the task, I usually take either underscore.js templates or handlebars
[04:57:41] <systemfault> (underscore.js does way more than templating though, it's a must)
[04:57:58] <thomedy> oh no i knew that shoky but thank you I just dont know how to really fix it right now
[04:58:04] <pachet> more bust than must
[04:58:06] <superchu> NodeX: http://use.perl.org/use.perl.org/_Aristotle/journal/33448.html
[04:58:17] <superchu> thats hilarious
[04:58:39] <superchu> http://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/18665/
[04:58:44] <thomedy> what im going to do for that crazy animation is change up the structure of my code a bit and instead of anonymous functions everywhere...
[04:58:54] <systemfault> superchu, that's pure win
[04:59:07] <thomedy> their all getting names so i can unbind the correct ones and make it run accurately and smoothley
[04:59:10] <thomedy> i gotta go to work now
[04:59:18] <pachet> down with anonymous functions!
[04:59:21] <thomedy> be back soon probably
[04:59:26] <shoky> thomedy: also removing the width:100% from overflow-container
[04:59:26] <pachet> long live easy stack tracing
[04:59:33] <shoky> thomedy: seems to almost fix it
[04:59:56] <amcsi_work> thanks
[05:06:19] <Vooloo> if I have a javascript insert string and pass variables to it, open up a modal window with an iframe, can I get my PHP to read those strings that were passed along?
[05:07:06] <laszlof> sure, if you post them to the script, or some other type of request
[05:07:21] <Vooloo> on clients site: <script type="text/javascript" src="https://mydomain.com/?api_key=xxx&firstname=John&lastname=Smith"></script> ... my iframe needs to read the parameters
[05:07:26] <superchu> post, or put them in the querystring
[05:08:05] <laszlof> $_REQUEST['api_key'], $_REQUEST['firstname'], $_REQUEST['lastname']
[05:08:06] <NodeX> [12:58:03] <superchu> NodeX: http://use.perl.org/use.perl.org/_Aristotle/journal/33448.html  <----- I cannot stress enough or say enough times It depends how one writes one's php
[05:08:10] <laszlof> or $_GET
[05:10:01] <superchu> NodeX: that is PHP's source code. Thats the quality of the code base..
[05:11:10] <superchu> NodeX: you don't find it strange to test if an integer is greater than INT_MAX..? or to use a float to check the length of a string
[05:12:20] <NodeX> I dont use float to test the length of a string
[05:12:29] <NodeX> so it doesn't cross my mind
[05:12:34] <systemfault> He doesn't get it..
[05:12:49] <NodeX> systemfault : you're an idiot
[05:12:58] <systemfault> Yes I am.
[05:13:00] <NodeX> Ignored
[05:13:13] <needlz> I've 4 elements with the ID <a id="deleteToggle/>, following code just work for the first item: $("#deleteToggle").click(function() { alert("hi");}; Any idea what I'm doing wrong?
[05:13:17] <NodeX> superchu : if someone writes bad C++ does it make C++ a bad language ?
[05:13:30] <systemfault> needlz, yeah.. IDs must be unique on a page
[05:13:32] <superchu> NodeX: Again, that code is the _sourcecode_ of PHP. Not something someone wrote in PHP
[05:13:34] <jetienne> "jQuery is used by 85% of webdevs" <- is that correct ?
[05:13:44] <NodeX> I didn't read it properly my bad
[05:13:46] <needlz> systemfault: ah, then I'll use class or rel. Thanks systemfault
[05:13:51] <sacho> can you stop talking about php here
[05:13:52] <Cork> jetienne: doubt that VERY much
[05:13:52] <systemfault> needlz, you're welcome :)
[05:14:01] <jetienne> Cork: why ?
[05:14:10] <systemfault> jetienne, seems a lot to me :D What are your sources?
[05:14:33] <laszlof> because theres more than 15% of the internet is contained in text only pages I'd imagine
[05:14:36] <Cork> jetienne: cause sure jquery is used a lot, but a huge amount of code is written in pure js, and then you have other frameworks ontop of that
[05:14:41] <laszlof> documentation, books, etc
[05:14:51] <Cork> jetienne: that makes that figure very unlikely
[05:14:59] <superchu> NodeX: :)
[05:15:16] <Vooloo> one time I hired a programmer to replace the text between two brackets {} .. his solution was 4 nested ifs instead of preg_replace
[05:15:30] <laszlof> Vooloo: quality programmer
[05:15:33] <systemfault> oh noes, not php again :(
[05:15:38] <NodeX> either way it doesnt matter ... and the argument is erroneuos
[05:15:44] <jetienne> Cork: hmm oh i think there is miscommunication. i meant 85% of all the personn doing web developement uses jQuery library.
[05:15:50] <NodeX> or however one spells it lol
[05:16:03] <NodeX> there is no "perfect suit all language"
[05:16:05] <systemfault> jetienne, the number is too high I think..
[05:16:23] <Cork> jetienne: ya, i know, but loads of ppl don't write in frameworks
[05:16:23] <pachet> jetienne: it still seems high
[05:16:26] <systemfault> jetienne, there's also YUI/Prototype/MooTools/Dojo/etc
[05:16:27] <superchu> NodeX: agree, i just find it funny how poorly written PHP are are at some places
[05:16:32] <pachet> and web developers arent necessarily frontend devs
[05:16:35] <NodeX> I do to
[05:16:43] <pachet> maybe 85% of freelance frontend web devs :[
[05:16:47] <superchu> NodeX: don't get me wrong, i think php is pretty great. But i _prefer_ C#
[05:16:51] <NodeX> wordpress, joomla, drupal - all examples how of to NOT write php
[05:16:54] <jetienne> systemfault: hmm ok i dont remmeber where i got it. ok i will look for more info
[05:16:57] <Cork> jetienne: that 85% of all web devs KNOW jquery is another matter
[05:17:09] <pachet> ^
[05:17:29] <superchu> NodeX: I cannot understand how wordpress got so big. Looked at the source-code a couple of years ago and cried..
[05:17:33] <superchu> hopefully its better now?
[05:17:39] <NodeX> I dont know because I dont touch it
[05:17:46] <pachet> and seems like 85% of web dev job listings mention jquery before javascript :[
[05:17:51] <jetienne> Cork: you mean like "devs knows jquery but dont use it, because their job makes them use something else" ?
[05:18:10] <NodeX> I don't propogate the use of BAD CMS/Frameworks nor encourage the use of them
[05:18:13] <jetienne> ok if i put 50% is that ok ?
[05:18:22] <Cork> jetienne: no, that 85% of developers know how it works, and uses it from time to time, but mainly use something else
[05:18:39] <superchu> NodeX: when im using php i always end up writing my own "framework" for that application
[05:18:41] <skylamer`> yes, may be his clonings xD
[05:18:45] <jetienne> Cork: ok
[05:18:50] <superchu> NodeX: i always find that to be the best approach
[05:18:57] <jetienne> ok thanks all, im realising this number is wrong
[05:18:58] <NodeX> I wrote a framework for a CMS that I use in everything
[05:19:14] <superchu> Sounds good. Since you can have full control of whats happening
[05:19:19] <NodeX> it's about 1% the weight of anything else out there and outperforms everything else 10/1
[05:19:23] <systemfault> superchu, last time I had to do a small 5 pager website, I used Silex, it was suprisingly good
[05:19:52] <superchu> NodeX, systemfault: the problem with existing "frameworks" is that they are often very bloated to "fit every case"
[05:20:09] <systemfault> superchu, I totally agree
[05:20:13] <superchu> I want a very scaled down and slim base to build upon
[05:20:14] <NodeX> and I only use PHP for what I need it .. I/e I don't do image converting with it lol
[05:20:21] <superchu> NodeX: ^^
[05:20:43] <NodeX> as I said earlier - each language has it's own job
[05:20:49] <superchu> yes
[05:21:01] <NodeX> and If you stay away from the bad functions and constructs in PHP it can be fast and it can scale
[05:21:30] <systemfault> If you do that, you have nothing to use :D
[05:21:45] <systemfault> </funny>
[05:22:04] <NodeX> can you view the sourcecode of c# ?
[05:22:13] <NodeX> ( I don't know much about it)
[05:22:32] <Cork> NodeX: not if its compiled
[05:22:46] <Cork> c# is similar to java in that aspect
[05:22:47] <NodeX> but as a general rule can you grab the source and compile yourself
[05:22:49] <ENQ> you can
[05:22:53] <superchu> NodeX: you mean the sourcecode of the language it self?
[05:22:59] <superchu> its available and open source
[05:23:01] <NodeX> yeh - like your PHP post above
[05:23:13] <ENQ> c# is easy to decompile, if its not secured
[05:23:15] <superchu> check out mono for example
[05:23:28] <sacho> "source code for the language"
[05:23:32] <sacho> ..
[05:23:33] <shoky> ^^
[05:23:34] <NodeX> It's not something I know alot about
[05:23:41] <NodeX> can it run on *nix ?
[05:23:42] <sacho> there's a specification
[05:23:50] <NodeX> I've got it in my head it's a winblows thing
[05:23:54] <sacho> at any rate
[05:23:56] <sacho> ##csharp
[05:24:03] <systemfault> C# is still a ECMA specification IIRC
[05:24:09] <systemfault> (Like ECMAScript :P )
[05:24:20] <systemfault> That makes C# on topic? ;)
[05:24:24] <xec> NodeX: there is the mono project for cross-platform c#/.net http://www.mono-project.com
[05:24:29] <superchu> sacho: thats what i meant.. lol, im tired ^^
[05:24:51] <NodeX> ok but is it intended to run on linux / unix
[05:25:08] <systemfault> As much as apache on windows.. I'd say
[05:25:12] <xec> NodeX: as a language it is not targeted at a specific platform
[05:25:21] <NodeX> ok
[05:25:46] <xec> NodeX: but more often than not, it's used for windows development
[05:25:47] <NodeX> I was going to say ... all that performance one gains from C Sharp get's lost when they run it on winblows lol
[05:25:57] <NodeX> (in a web sense anyway)
[05:26:08] <xec> that's not true at all, really
[05:26:22] <NodeX> does it have it's own web server ?
[05:26:23] <systemfault> Someone should tell him that Java exists if he doesn't like microsoft..
[05:26:42] <xec> compiled c# web services on windows iis very good performance-wise
[05:26:47] <xec> iis is*
[05:27:03] <NodeX> but it's still windows lol
[05:27:18] <laszlof> what does that have to do with anything
[05:27:21] <xec> NodeX: you sound like a linux fanboy :)
[05:27:24] <NodeX> so by default it's insecure and slow - sorry less secure than *nix / less fast than *nix
[05:27:33] <NodeX> not at all - right tool for the job
[05:27:34] <laszlof> mm, fanboy's
[05:27:52] <systemfault> Yep.. a linux + PHP fanboy..
[05:27:52] <laszlof> right tool for the job, yet you use a blanket statement like "windows is insecure and slow"
[05:28:07] <NodeX> yet the statement is true ;)
[05:28:12] <laszlof> it is not.
[05:28:15] <xec> not at all, really
[05:28:22] <NodeX> through years of winblows servers being rooted
[05:28:28] <laszlof> and linux servers.
[05:28:30] <superchu> NodeX: if its true, then please show me a IIS exploit and use it
[05:28:32] <laszlof> and unix servers
[05:28:36] <NodeX> and APache / Nginx being the #1 choice of web server
[05:28:47] <laszlof> apache runs on windows
[05:28:51] <laszlof> nginx probably does too
[05:29:01] <NodeX> yet they dont in real world situations
[05:29:11] <laszlof> source?
[05:29:13] <NodeX> or on real websites - because the core in windows is slow
[05:29:18] <systemfault> Oh my... the guy is even more clueless that I could have ever imagined..
[05:29:19] <superchu> LOL
[05:29:20] <shoky> wat
[05:29:21] <NodeX> nginx.org ;)
[05:29:22] <laszlof> lol
[05:29:24] <xec> what exactly defines a "real" website
[05:29:35] <NodeX> top 100 alexa - pick one
[05:29:42] <NodeX> apart from google of course
[05:29:45] <laszlof> that doesnt prove anything
[05:29:49] <NodeX> we all know google runs on windows
[05:29:50] <xec> so the top 101th website is not "real"?
[05:29:54] <NodeX> no proves nothing lol
[05:30:02] <NodeX> top 1000 , top 10000
[05:30:07] <NodeX> keep going
[05:30:21] <laszlof> source?
[05:30:28] <xec> NodeX: what exactly is your point, because something is used more it must be better?
[05:30:37] <NodeX> you cannot seriously want to argue windows is better at serving websites than *nix
[05:30:37] <shoky> people use macs :\
[05:30:49] <systemfault> xec, linux guys usually use that same argument against windows :D
[05:30:51] <NodeX> macs are to expensive
[05:30:53] <superchu> NodeX: I can bring down a apache server with php just by setting the content-length of my http-request.
[05:31:03] <laszlof> I never said it was. I was debating your argument that it is slow and insecure
[05:31:06] <NodeX> but that's a whole nother story
[05:31:10] <sonnie> hi there. i write 'source: "prog.pl"' in UI.autocomplete. but it seems that ?parameter=value is not sent to script. why?
[05:31:12] <laszlof> and no real websites use it
[05:31:17] <NodeX> superchu : a badly configured server - probably
[05:31:20] <laszlof> http://news.netcraft.com/archives/2012/01/03/january-2012-web-server-survey.html
[05:31:33] <superchu> NodeX: no, its a "feature" of php.. patched recently tough
[05:31:39] <laszlof> i guess 84 million websites is "nothing"
[05:31:47] <xec> NodeX: i'm not a windows fanboy, i'm just saying you should re-think your arguments as they don't hold water at all
[05:31:57] <Vooloo> 84 million slow websites :D
[05:32:03] <xe|a> hey guys
[05:32:03] <NodeX> right so I can't configure my PHP / Webserver to not allow a request of that size .. silly me
[05:32:07] <pachet> NodeX: alexa top 100, you say? ok
[05:32:09] <pachet> live.com
[05:32:16] <laszlof> larger market share than nginx
[05:32:34] <superchu> NodeX: until recently PHP allocated the exact amount of memory as the content-length of the request. You think that is good design?
[05:32:49] <NodeX> how many of those sites are corporate who "need" garuntees that open source cannot give them ?
[05:33:03] <NodeX> did I say it was good design?
[05:33:07] <laszlof> what does that have to do with anything?
[05:33:21] <sacho> can you please stop discussing php here?
[05:33:21] <NodeX> laszlof : everything
[05:33:22] <laszlof> is live.com slow and insecure? no
[05:33:24] <shoky> what does anything have to do with anything, stfu losers :\
[05:33:29] <sacho> i don't like being forced to use ignore
[05:33:31] <systemfault> sacho++
[05:34:18] <NodeX> http://www.tvog.net/hosting.php <--- Apache - no mention of IIS that I can see
[05:34:23] <systemfault> Anyway.. NodeX is a good example of someone suffering from the Dunning-Kruger syndrome :P
[05:34:31] <superchu> NodeX: i found it amusing that you're promoting nginx.. that are a event-driven webserver.. and yet you suggested Flo0815 to use a synchronous approach..
[05:34:37] <NodeX> nor windows
[05:34:52] <laszlof> NodeX: thank you for digging up my hostname
[05:35:16] <NodeX> superchu : his problem needed a synchronous approach  ... something you don't seem to get
[05:35:23] <NodeX> ignored
[05:35:38] <xe|a> can somebody tell me a better solution for my form select? I would like to load js if a certain name is selected. I am currently using .change but here the problem is if the page gets loaded and the name is already in my select list it doesnt load the js cos nothing has changed yet. Any ideas?
[05:35:39] <superchu> NodeX: no it didn't. It could easly be resolved using callbacks/events.
[05:35:48] <shoky> right, waiting for a confirm box to close is definitely something you want to do synchronously
[05:36:00] <superchu> which is the "hot stuff" right now.. with node.js and nginx
[05:36:12] <NodeX> he WANTED to wait for it to be true to continue ELSE dontr
[05:36:18] <NodeX> tell me how to do that ansych lol
[05:36:19] <Meekoh> xe|a: Why not just trigger change manually the first time on page load?
[05:36:23] <superchu> NodeX: you do know that alert and prompt _blocks_ the UI-thread
[05:36:32] <pachet> what Meekoh said
[05:36:34] <NodeX> and I will bow down to your brilliance
[05:36:37] <shoky> ohhhh, he WANTED to wait, i see
[05:36:47] <xe|a> Meekoh: how can i do that?
[05:37:05] <superchu> NodeX: and the approach to wait is not recommended.. as it blocks everything else
[05:37:05] <NodeX> I dont like sync actions anymore than you it seems but sometimes they are needed
[05:37:13] <Meekoh> xe|a: Just call .change() with no arguments.
[05:37:25] <Meekoh> xe|a: That triggers the event
[05:37:30] <xe|a> ah ok
[05:37:38] <NodeX> laszlof : why so quiet ?
[05:37:51] <superchu> this guy is awesome :)
[05:37:51] <pachet> xe|a: or if you're using event namespacing ( as you should ), you can trigger that event specifically, without any others you might have bound
[05:37:52] <NodeX> MS Fanboy not promoting MS tech ...
[05:37:57] <shoky> i assume he got bored
[05:38:02] <laszlof> i dont care to be trolled
[05:38:03] <pachet> xe|a: eg $(foo).trigger('change.mynamespace')
[05:38:05] <Meekoh> lol NodeX cannot troll hard enough for this room.
[05:38:08] <xe|a> but to do this with change is the right direction ay?
[05:38:13] <NodeX> it's good for an argument it seems but not goood enough for your customers ;)
[05:38:23] <NodeX> I am not actually in troll mode yet
[05:38:28] <Meekoh> xe|a: Seems like the easiest yeah.
[05:38:28] <laszlof> they arent "my" customers
[05:38:29] <NodeX> I was enjoying a good debate
[05:38:31] <laszlof> anyways
[05:38:39] <laszlof> just because its in my hostname, doesnt mean its "my" company.
[05:38:42] <granden> Is there any jquery plugin that could accomplish a flip like in2media.dk have on ther ewebsite?
[05:38:55] <granden> That one that makes it look like a 3D flip, i.e. click Work.
[05:39:13] <shoky> granden.js
[05:39:45] <skylamer`> its all in the source, granden
[05:39:51] <NodeX> laszlof : source ? lololol
[05:40:00] <laszlof> and, ignored
[05:40:12] <NodeX> \o/
[05:41:03] <granden> shoky: Haha :)
[05:41:16] <granden> skylamer`: Yeah, but I dont get it, where the code for the flip is.
[05:42:08] <shoky> gotta flip for it
[05:42:35] <skylamer`> search
[05:43:27] <NodeX> that's alot of JS files :/
[05:44:32] <pachet> $.threedeeflipmyshit()
[05:44:43] <shoky> granden: another site that does it, probably easier to find it here http://dl.dropbox.com/u/39519/talks/tooling-q1/index.html
[05:46:09] <granden> shoky: Thanks, will look at that.
[05:46:32] <shoky> granden: seems like it's reveal.js
[05:46:42] <shoky> granden: http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/#/
[05:47:36] <superchu> pretty sure its css3 transitions
[05:49:19] <shoky> yeah it is
[05:50:06] <repair> which one is better to do paging, jq filter or php?
[05:50:24] <NodeX> php rocks - true story hahahaaha
[05:50:26] <repair> php channel seems to be invite only?
[05:50:32] <superchu> NodeX: you suck at trolling ;)
[05:50:44] <sacho> ##php
[05:50:45] <systemfault> repair, I think you need to be registered with the network
[05:50:47] <NodeX> register your nickname repair - be aware they are a bunch of arrogant idiots
[05:50:48] <sacho> also, "better"?
[05:51:01] <NodeX> depends how much data
[05:51:30] <repair> so which one if lots of data?
[05:51:51] <NodeX> sorting the data aswell ?
[05:52:06] <repair> php sorts it
[05:52:41] <NodeX> imo serverside .. for throughput and nicer load on your webserver
[05:52:47] <repair> multisort function
[05:53:06] <shoky> people are really gonna go past page 5?
[05:53:13] <repair> lol
[05:53:17] <NodeX> are you getting it from a database?
[05:53:23] <shoky> serious question
[05:53:30] <shoky> if not, why bother with pagination
[05:53:32] <pachet> shoky: or page 1
[05:53:32] <shoky> useless
[05:53:37] <granden> shoky: Thanks!
[05:53:46] <shoky> np
[05:53:57] <repair> shoky, i think google has limited it's image search from what it used to be, not sure though
[05:54:24] <repair> perhaps they know ppl don't go beyond page 5
[05:54:32] <shoky> we all know it..
[05:54:50] <NodeX> then why ever have more than 50 rows in your database lol
[05:54:52] <NodeX> :S
[05:55:01] <shoky> huh?
[05:55:16] <repair> i liked in google image search to go into like page 32
[05:55:23] <NodeX> 5*10 per page ... if people only want 5 pages
[05:55:40] <NodeX> and exactly is the answer to the answer
[05:55:43] <shoky> repair: yea to get half-random stuff.. great use of pagination ;P
[05:55:57] <pachet> answer to the answer
[05:55:59] <pachet> dat meta!
[05:56:20] <tdskate> can a CollectionView have a default compiled handlebars template ?
[05:56:26] <shoky> so if you only show people the top 50 items, that means you only need 50 rows in your database? wtf..
[05:56:37] <repair> no, i need all the records fetched just don't know if jq can handle lots of records
[05:56:42] <NodeX> shoky : my point exatly
[05:56:50] <NodeX> how can you say that pagination is useless after 5 pages
[05:56:55] <NodeX> not everyhting is a search
[05:57:21] <NodeX> some people like to browse page by page ;)
[05:57:24] <shoky> when did i say its useless after 5 pages? what does "not everything is a search" mean ?
[05:57:45] <shoky> well, good for them?
[05:58:00] <NodeX> you stated that no-body goes past page 5 correct ?
[05:58:04] <shoky> no
[05:58:14] <NodeX> [13:53:03] <shoky> people are really gonna go past page 5?
[05:58:15] <repair> ic, you are suggesting that there would be no paging at all but a search box
[05:58:21] <shoky> that's quite a statement..
[05:58:27] <NodeX> semantics
[05:58:29] <shoky> huh?
[05:58:30] <NodeX> it's implied
[05:58:32] <shoky> i even said:
[05:58:33] <darcyclarke> ?tell gf3 congrats mate, well deserved make sure to say hi to my buddy jeff jewis (you should call him JJ ;) )
[05:58:34] <bot-t> darcyclarke, Okay.
[05:58:35] <shoky> <shoky> serious question
[05:58:37] <shoky> WTF, man
[05:58:42] <repair> hmm i think most ppl wants to click on pages
[05:59:04] <NodeX> my ignore list is glowing red today
[05:59:11] <shoky> NodeX: i was asking him, if he had answered 'yes' , i would have nothing else to say..
[05:59:30] <superchu> THIS CHANNEL IS AWESOME
[05:59:45] <superchu> PEOPLE DISCUSSIONG EVERYHING BUT JQUERY
[05:59:52] <superchu> CAPS-LOCK!!!!111!!!ONE!
[05:59:55] <superchu> :)
[05:59:57] <NodeX> repair, personaly I would do it clientside to save your visitors resources
[06:00:12] <pachet> ..
[06:00:15] <NodeX> alot more people nowerdays use smart phones which have less resources than a laptop/desktop
[06:00:16] <shoky> ;)
[06:00:25] * pachet waits for him to catch it
[06:00:31] <shoky> yea so clientside it is!
[06:00:40] <shoky> or am i on ignore or smth
[06:00:47] <shoky> kids.
[06:01:03] <superchu> ehm
[06:01:03] <repair> NodeX: so if there'd be like 100 pages each 25 items (images) jq would be fine`?
[06:01:24] <NodeX> it will do it but it's all done in the client's memory/CPU
[06:01:35] <pachet> repair: i think he meant to say serverside
[06:01:40] <NodeX> which if on a slow smart phone will cripple it
[06:01:46] <NodeX> sorry
[06:01:49] <NodeX> serverside
[06:01:51] <NodeX> my bad
[06:01:52] <repair> ic
[06:01:59] <NodeX> thanks pachet
[06:02:15] <repair> pity i don't know how to do it with php and the channel is invite
[06:02:16] <NodeX> my head is battered from all this trolling bad kids all day
[06:02:34] <NodeX> pastebin what you have so far and I'll help you
[06:02:35] <superchu> repair: you do not know how to do what with php?
[06:02:44] <hobs> ##php iirc
[06:02:46] <repair> paging
[06:02:51] <hobs> @repair
[06:02:55] <NodeX> yer php is ##php
[06:03:00] <NodeX> but you have to be registered
[06:03:04] <hobs> right
[06:03:12] <hobs> its freenode ya dingus get registered
[06:03:15] <repair> oh i don't bother that
[06:03:29] <hobs> how are you going to bask in the wisdom of the ancients who occupy this realm
[06:03:37] <NodeX> hahaha
[06:03:47] <repair> why does everything require reg these days anyway?
[06:04:01] <hobs> because they decided it would make you mad
[06:04:10] <shoky> humans mimic bots too easily these days
[06:04:13] <Haprog> #php @ QuakeNet is quite nice also
[06:04:31] <NodeX> they are a bit less arrogant @ QuakeNet
[06:04:49] <shoky> oh my they were arrogant to him in ##php freenode
[06:05:17] <repair> i don't know, i
[06:05:29] <NodeX> repair : pastebin what you have already and i'll help you
[06:05:36] <shoky> oh i dont bother that
[06:06:57] <repair> NodeX: it's a mess i just did the rough plan
[06:07:54] <NodeX> it's ok , just pastebin it
[06:10:45] <xe|a> is there a reason why .trigger performs the triggered function 5 times?
[06:10:59] <laszlof> pastebin your code
[06:11:32] <shoky> my guess is you binded the click handler 5 times
[06:11:43] <laszlof> probably
[06:12:53] <repair> no, maybe i try myself first
[06:16:35] <xe|a> http://pastebin.com/u8xmQZXU
[06:17:54] <tocka> How could I use submitHandler for multiple forms?
[06:18:02] <tocka> What Im trying to do now is submitHandler: function("form#emailForm") {
[06:18:05] <tocka> but it doesnt work
[06:19:22] <repair> just #emailForm?
[06:19:27] <tocka> Doesnt work
[06:19:42] <laszlof> you shouldnt be using the same ID's on multiple forms anyways
[06:19:43] <repair> thats an id, no?
[06:19:51] <laszlof> add a class to it
[06:19:55] <laszlof> then do .class
[06:20:04] <tocka> missing formal parameter
[06:20:04] <tocka> submitHandler: function("form#emailForm") {
[06:20:12] <tocka> This is what kind of error I get btw
[06:20:24] <shoky> xe|a: does that 'attach' callback get called more than once?
[06:20:25] <youngin> i need http://www.professorcloud.com/mainsite/cloud-zoom.htm rewritten - it's just too big and messy - someone willing to do it for $70 or whatever?
[06:20:28] <laszlof> wait, why are you specifying a selectory as a parameter
[06:20:32] <laszlof> selector*
[06:20:47] <tocka> uhm, because I want data from that form to be posted
[06:21:04] <shoky> xe|a: because you're binding another event handler each time the 'attach' callback is called..
[06:21:29] <laszlof> tocka: I think you're confused how functions work
[06:21:37] <laszlof> you're defining a function, you shouldnt be passing a selector to it
[06:21:49] <laszlof> the validate plugin will automatically do that
[06:21:50] <tocka> Argh.. :
[06:22:40] <laszlof> $('form#emailForm').validate({....
[06:22:47] <laszlof> submitHandler: function(form) {
[06:22:52] <xe|a> hmm
[06:22:56] <laszlof> then use form in your handler function
[06:23:09] <xe|a> that might be
[06:23:12] <tocka> thank you
[06:23:13] <laszlof> the form specified above will automatically pass to it
[06:23:16] <superchu> tocka: submitHandler: function(form) { $('#' + form).whatever() }
[06:23:29] <superchu> tocka: then you call submitHandler('emailForm');
[06:23:52] <tocka> thank you
[06:24:02] <superchu> and don't use tagnames when you have ID
[06:24:11] <superchu> its faster to just select on the ID
[06:24:18] <tocka> ok
[06:24:22] <xe|a> shoky: if I debug that code and put a bp on the attach line it performs that line just one time
[06:24:30] <superchu> :)
[06:24:32] <laszlof> id's should be unique
[06:24:39] <laszlof> but are often not
[06:24:47] <superchu> then you're doing it wrong
[06:24:50] <laszlof> right
[06:24:57] <laszlof> its amazing how many people "do it wrong"
[06:25:03] <shoky> xe|a: what attach line
[06:25:18] <xe|a> line 5
[06:25:31] <superchu> laszlof: well, it wont validate as xhtml or html5..
[06:25:35] <shoky> xe|a: how bout 7
[06:25:56] <laszlof> yeah
[06:26:02] <laszlof> tocka: http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Validation#Options_for_the_validate.28.29_method
[06:26:06] <laszlof> bottom of the page
[06:26:12] <laszlof> has a small example with submitHandler
[06:26:29] <xe|a> in line 7 I declare a var
[06:26:36] <laszlof> and why you dont want to use a selector within submitHandler rather than the form object being passed to the function
[06:26:55] <xe|a> there is just one attach fct
[06:27:00] <repair> why not just $('form').submit(function() { ?
[06:27:07] <xe|a> and this gets called just one time
[06:27:10] <shoky> xe|a: yes but line 5 is not INSIDE the function
[06:27:19] <xe|a> hmm w8
[06:27:19] <spazion> hi, is it possible to use in class selection $('.class') a placeholder? e.g. $('.class###')
[06:27:21] <laszlof> repair: he's using the validation plugin
[06:27:33] <shoky> xe|a: and in line 7 you also call jQuery(..) and assign a value to that var..
[06:27:34] <superchu> oh, i didn't even notice hte validation plugin
[06:27:40] <tocka> ;) thank you all
[06:27:44] <superchu> tocka: forget my code ^^
[06:27:53] <superchu> but the ID and tagname-stuff is still true.
[06:28:02] <laszlof> i assumed so since he is using submitHandler:. I recently used this so I remember it :)
[06:28:07] <superchu> :)
[06:28:31] <repair> wy not make validator yourself?
[06:28:37] <laszlof> why reinvent the wheel?
[06:28:46] <laszlof> for basic form validation, maybe
[06:29:05] <repair> don't have to ask anything from anyone when you make it yourself :)
[06:29:06] <xe|a> after .trigger in 34 it jumps always back to 15 and performs the folowing code
[06:29:15] <xe|a> 5 times
[06:29:27] <xe|a> and then it finishes
[06:29:33] <shoky> xe|a: how many times does line 7 run?
[06:29:40] <xe|a> 1 time
[06:29:48] <laszlof> repair: I think it comes down to individual needs. I've built my own in the past, but typically it was either for validating only a few fields, or on a mobile app where size was an issue
[06:30:08] <repair> serverside should valid the form data anyway so jq is just to chaek if all fields are filled etc
[06:30:13] <xe|a> .trigger runs 1 time as well
[06:30:19] <laszlof> repair: right, you want to use both
[06:30:45] <laszlof> client side is just for the benefit of the client, speed and what have you. serverside is for the benefit of not being exploited :)
[06:30:56] <mazzachre> Gah, don't you just love being given some production html and a set of "fixit"s? And then looking through them finding out that formatting is done via tables, yet table data is kept in a series of divs!!!!
[06:31:02] <shoky> xe|a: cant help much without a fiddle/demo/something
[06:32:41] <xe|a> ok no worries thx anyways
[06:33:12] <xe|a> the problem with cms
[06:33:22] <xe|a> cant build it on fiddle 1on1
[06:36:08] <repair> i don't think you need any validator pluging on client side
[06:36:25] <repair> easy enough to make one for yourself
[06:36:28] <xckpd7> question: I'm working on a project that basically loads other pages onto my index.html file. The problem is, is that when the files I load change, the cache never clears and I always see the old version. How do I go about that?
[06:37:01] <systemfault> xckpd7, if you use chrome, you can try disabling the caching
[06:37:13] <znow> Hey! :) im implementing autocomplete in a text field for my rails app. im passing an list to the js file and fetching it in jquery - my problem is, I need to insert the id of the name shown in the autocomplete in the db, not the actual name. but if I pass a list of arrays (name and id) to jquery autocomplete, it wont show the names in the autocomplete, heres my gist; https://gist.github.com/e9d9578ac0b295a75dee how could I do this?
[06:37:51] <xckpd7> systemfault: no way to do it per app (or maybe do something different in my application
[06:38:24] <repair> refresh page?
[06:38:29] <systemfault> xckpd7, Ahhh, you don't want that just for development?
[06:38:45] <xckpd7> repair: doesn't work because I only refresh index.html, not the files being loaded
[06:38:52] <N3tw0rK> can you process a json sting on an input to a function   ie.  function([{test: test, test2: test2}]
[06:38:53] <systemfault> xckpd7, You could use a timestamp as a cache buster..
[06:38:55] <xckpd7> repair: hard refreshes do nothing
[06:39:02] <xckpd7> systemfault: explain?
[06:39:14] <xckpd7> systemfault: that sounds good
[06:39:36] <systemfault> xckpd7, You append a parameter to the URL with a timestamp
[06:39:53] <systemfault> www.rofl.lol?cachebuster=2342837474
[06:40:39] <repair> i wonder if there is an alternative php channel which don't require reg or invite?
[06:41:07] <systemfault> repair, just register.. it takes a minute and they don't spam so you can use your real email
[06:41:20] <repair> heh
[06:41:22] <laszlof> znow: yeah, you cant do that
[06:41:49] <laszlof> you'll have to build a callback function that splits the ID/name apart
[06:42:10] <znow> laszlof: yeah, thought of that aswell, could you please point me in the right direction?=
[06:42:20] <znow> laszlof: and where should the callback be attached?
[06:42:24] <xckpd7> systemfault: thanks I'm going to try that out
[06:42:39] <laszlof> im not sure I understand what you're doing with the ID
[06:42:57] <laszlof> but the callback function would be attached to source
[06:43:13] <laszlof> you could build an ajax call within that
[06:43:33] <laszlof> so rather than directly grabbing the autocomplete array on page load, it would pull it dynamically
[06:44:57] <znow> laszlof: I need to show the client names in the autocomplete, but only insert the client id into the db
[06:45:07] <znow> laszlof: since the db field is integer, and only holds the id, not the actual name
[06:45:32] <laszlof> cant you do a union select to get the name?
[06:45:38] <laszlof> or something
[06:45:42] <laszlof> (i dont do much ruby)
[06:46:47] <znow> laszlof: that is not my problem, I got that sorted, but when I get that array, and try to fetch it inside jquery source attribute in the .autocomplete, it shows a list of rows, but without names, can I send you a screenshot?
[06:47:31] <laszlof> sure
[06:47:37] <znow> sec
[06:47:50] <laszlof> the array you pass as the "source" element has to just contain the names
[06:47:55] <laszlof> you cant specify id's along with it
[06:48:08] <laszlof> if you build it into a callback function, you could probably split the ID's out
[06:49:05] <laszlof> basically in your callback, you'd take that "data" element you have, and step through it with .each (or a for loop), and then build out a new array, and push the names into it
[06:49:11] <laszlof> then return the new array from the callback
[06:49:19] <repair> is autocomplete a plugin?
[06:49:32] <laszlof> its part of jqueryui
[06:50:18] <heeton> Is it possible to trigger a click event including the relevant FocusOut events for other elements?
[06:50:30] <znow> laszlof: http://imgur.com/MDRLM
[06:51:07] <laszlof> znow: yea, sub arrays.. not going to work :)
[06:51:18] <znow> laszlof: yes, that is what I though
[06:51:23] <znow> thought*
[06:51:26] <znow> aswell
[06:51:27] <laszlof> build a callback as I mentioned above
[06:51:45] <znow> laszlof: mind taking a min with me, so I could complete this? :)
[06:51:54] <laszlof> sure
[06:52:08] <znow> laszlof: thanks, appreciate it!
[06:52:37] <znow> okay, so - source : function () { any parameters?

[06:57:59] <znow> laszlof: yeah thanks, aw damn, had an article from stackoverflow with that callback with request and response, can tfind it now....
[06:58:10] <repair> this jqui seems to have a caledar too
[06:58:11] <laszlof> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2844103/jqueryui-autocomplete-when-no-results-are-returned
[06:58:14] <laszlof> that might help
[06:58:24] <laszlof> its pretty easy to implement
[06:58:33] <laszlof> that uses an ajax call, but you dont need that
[06:58:37] <repair> ...after all the troubles i had writing one, sigh :(
[06:58:58] <laszlof> just grab the .data element like you normally do within the callback,
[06:59:10] <laszlof> create a new empty array
[06:59:20] <laszlof> step through the data element, and push the name to the array
[06:59:26] <laszlof> then do response(array)
[07:00:17] <xckpd7> systemfault: that worked perfectly, thanks
[07:00:20] <xckpd7> systemfault++
[07:00:44] <znow> laszlof: just a sec
[07:00:54] <laszlof> repair: the calendar plugin is pretty cool :)
[07:01:19] <repair> i noticed one thing i can change in mine
[07:01:36] <repair> but mine also marks holidays
[07:02:41] <repair> never though of using it as a datepicker but i can alter mine to work as one too
[07:02:43] <znow> laszlof: https://gist.github.com/e9d9578ac0b295a75dee im not an js expert, so im trying out :p how does it look?
[07:03:13] <systemfault> xckpd7, :D
[07:03:32] <WhiskerBiscuit> How can I use jquery to read a cookie into a variable?
[07:03:45] <WhiskerBiscuit> var xxx = $.cookie('foobar');
[07:05:01] <laszlof> znow: you need to split out the names from the id's
[07:05:19] <znow> laszlof: hmm yeah, so I would take the data.split something?
[07:05:20] <repair> you answered yourself now you only need to write a function WhiskerBiscuit :)
[07:05:25] <laszlof> also, you're not using request properly
[07:05:34] <laszlof> no, I just use "split" generally
[07:05:38] <laszlof> not the actual function
[07:05:53] <znow> laszlof: how would you do it?
[07:06:13] <znow> laszlof:       data = request($('#client.autocomplete').data('source')) and then data.split() ?
[07:07:20] <laszlof> https://gist.github.com/ef2002b925a1ee631010
[07:07:23] <laszlof> something like that maybe
[07:09:11] <znow> laszlof: in console, im getting Uncaught TypeError: object is not a function
[07:09:17] <WhiskerBiscuit> repair: any suggestions?
[07:09:23] <znow> laszlof: oh sec
[07:09:34] <ezio> can anyone tell me why the first table is not width: 100%    http://206.248.142.234:52170/company_profile http://tzd-themes.com/gebo_admin/index.php?uid=1&page=datatable
[07:09:51] <znow> laszlof: oh, still
[07:10:03] <repair> WhiskerBiscuit: document.cookie.split(";")
[07:10:14] <znow> laszlof: data = request($('#client_autocomplete').data('source')) it complains about that
[07:10:21] <laszlof> I changed it
[07:10:23] <laszlof> see above
[07:10:24] <znow> ah
[07:10:31] <laszlof> request is an object
[07:10:33] <laszlof> not a function
[07:10:38] <WhiskerBiscuit> im not even trying to split the cookie up yet.  Just read the whole thing first into a variable
[07:10:44] <laszlof> add a console.log(request) in there
[07:10:52] <laszlof> I believe there is a "term" element
[07:10:53] <repair> WhiskerBiscuit: document.cookie
[07:10:55] <laszlof> request.term
[07:11:07] <shoky> ezio: what table
[07:11:25] <znow> laszlof: Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'length' of undefined
[07:11:55] <ezio> shoky, any of the datatables on the second one
[07:11:57] <repair> WhiskerBiscuit: i don't know how to make it a $.cookie function, i've never bother do so
[07:12:05] <laszlof> znow: without seeing the live code its difficult to say
[07:12:12] <ezio> shoky, compared to the datatable on the first one
[07:12:18] <znow> laszlof: yes ofc mate, what do you need?
[07:12:26] <znow> laszlof: its the exact code as you pasted
[07:12:27] <ezio> shoky, reisize the window after load
[07:12:31] <ezio> on each one
[07:12:46] <laszlof> znow: i know, but the ruby code doesnt show me what is actually sent as HTML
[07:12:49] <ezio> and there's really nothing i can see different with the code
[07:13:06] <shoky> ezio: not really sure what you mean..
[07:13:31] <ezio> shoky, the first one, the data table stays the same size when the window is resized ... not good
[07:13:44] <znow> laszlof: https://gist.github.com/ef2002b925a1ee631010#comments what is in the console
[07:13:54] <shoky> ah
[07:14:11] <toughguyhlve> shoky, you're looking dapper today!
[07:14:17] <shoky> ezio:  width: 664px  meight have something to do with it
[07:14:21] <shoky> might
[07:14:22] <laszlof> znow: yeah, i'm interested in the html source, not the console
[07:14:27] * toughguyhlve imagines shoky wears a tophat and monicle to work
[07:14:31] <shoky> toughguyhlve: thnx. what does dat mean ;P
[07:14:33] <ezio> shoky, agreed, but where is that getting over ridden
[07:14:38] <toughguyhlve> it means you look like a sir!
[07:14:51] <shoky> ezio: eh
[07:14:52] <ezio> shoky, it's just setting the value to 100% iniially then converting that to pixels
[07:14:54] <znow> laszlof: you want the output of <% @client = Client.all.map{ |c| [c.name, c.id] } %> ?
[07:15:17] <ezio> shoky, the setups for the tables seem to be similar too
[07:15:38] <laszlof> no,   <%= f.text_field :client_id, {:class => "input-xlarge span4", :id => "client_autocomplete", :style => "width:300px", :data => {:source => @client}} %>
[07:15:55] <laszlof> i know that generates a textbox, but I'd like to see how the data element is used
[07:16:18] <znow> laszlof:
[07:16:22] <znow> laszlof: ah, sec
[07:16:33] <z0ned> N3tw0rK, sup
[07:16:46] <WhiskerBiscuit> maybe the .cookie function isnt working.  I'm getting a "Objet doesnt support property or method 'cookie'
[07:16:55] <znow> laszlof:https://gist.github.com/ef2002b925a1ee631010#comments this?
[07:17:03] <WhiskerBiscuit> is .cookie part of the default jquery?
[07:17:35] <repair> WhiskerBiscuit: no, i don't think so
[07:17:41] <repair> you need to make it
[07:17:46] <laszlof> znow: its a blank comment
[07:17:58] <repair> WhiskerBiscuit: it's not difficult
[07:18:00] <znow> laszlof: wha..... gah sec
[07:18:07] <laszlof> n/m there it is
[07:18:57] <WhiskerBiscuit> repair: im sure its not difficult, but if I could have figured it out with google, I would have by now
[07:19:05] <znow> laszlof: it is? it didnt show it to me either though, but here it is aswell: https://gist.github.com/e9d9578ac0b295a75dee
[07:19:40] <repair> WhiskerBiscuit: just do the normal function first then it's easy to convert it to jq
[07:22:12] <ezio> can anyone tell me why the size is being overridden in the first web page?    http://206.248.142.234:52170/company_profile http://tzd-themes.com/gebo_admin/index.php?uid=1&page=datatable
[07:23:07] <pandu101> hi all. jquery newbie here. Im trying to use jquery ajax to create a domain name availability site. However, I cant figure out how to display the response from my server. My code is here (see line 11) --> http://bpaste.net/show/CnxmRmr7p4j8FR9IBu1R/
[07:23:32] <cannjeff> ezio: size of what?
[07:23:40] <ezio> the data table
[07:23:51] <ezio> in the first one it doesn't follow when it's resized
[07:24:07] <ezio> the datatable setup looks identical too
[07:24:19] <ezio> but in the first one it's overridden with a pixel value
[07:24:26] <N3tw0rK> z0ned: im still working on that code you sent me yesterday, do you think you will have some time to field a couple questions?
[07:24:54] <kollapse> Hello. Why can't I use :gt(-1) selector ?
[07:25:04] <kollapse> Or if that doesn't work isn't there any :gte() selector ?
[07:25:07] <kollapse> As in greater-then-or-equal ?
[07:25:15] <laszlof> znow: yeah, the formating gets all jacked in your data-source element
[07:25:49] <z0ned> sure
[07:25:49] <laszlof> I'd advise building another controller to generate the data with an ajax call
[07:25:59] <z0ned> ill be here for the next 8 hours :P
[07:26:06] <superchu> pandu101: http://bpaste.net/show/M7tEhxtfsEcw8XayvooB/
[07:26:11] <toughguyhlve> Shoky, here's a question.
[07:26:17] <toughguyhlve> You got a sec?
[07:26:46] <znow> laszlof: no need for another controller, could just build a method though. so you want me to grab the whole bunch by ajax instead of parsing it by the data attribute in the tag?
[07:27:51] <laszlof> znow: right
[07:28:05] <znow> laszlof: okay, ill do that in sec, thanks so far! :)
[07:28:34] <cannjeff> collapse you can use an OR like so $(":gt(0), eq(0)"); that is essentially a greater than or equal selector
[07:29:02] <cannjeff> sorry thats $(":gt(0), :eq(0)");
[07:29:15] <cannjeff> but the :gt(index), index is zero based
[07:30:14] <cannjeff> ezio still not seeing it, you may need to be more specific, what size the getting overridden? page size, font size, border size, padding size..there are lots of sizes
[07:30:46] <ezio> cannjeff, in the first example, resize the browser and look at the behaviour of the datatable
[07:30:48] <Zhy> I'm excluding a table column on click this way: $('table td:not(:nth-child(2)') is there a way to exclude the first and second child in one expression?
[07:31:36] <cannjeff> ezio: ahh now i see it, i've fixed that before gimme a second
[07:31:48] <Zhy> *) one bracket missing ^^
[07:31:55] <shoky> toughguyhlve: sure
[07:32:00] <ezio> cannjeff, <3
[07:35:07] <N3tw0rK> z0ned: sounds like your work is getting in the way of your fun
[07:38:05] <thomedy> excuse me i have a questoin but im on my break at work so if i leave please forgive me
[07:38:15] <thomedy> first off is anyone working
[07:38:22] <shoky> ?
[07:38:23] <thomedy> or is this room dead
[07:38:26] <thomedy> oh hey
[07:38:31] <shoky> 900 people here dude
[07:38:32] <nFFF> Homeslices, http://jsfiddle.net/fU4Yn/1/
[07:38:39] <nFFF> need to jsut simply remove /130x130
[07:38:43] <thomedy> so i started naming my functions
[07:38:43] <nFFF> and keep rest of url intact
[07:38:55] <thomedy> and then calling them changed the behavior
[07:39:17] <codeAssassin> thomedy: be a good sport and provide a jsfiddle
[07:39:28] <sandoo> Hello, i'm a javascript/jquery beginner and i'm trying to make a simple script that allow endless pagination. What I done is working but can't figure how to wait the current event is done before starting a new one : http://jsfiddle.net/Ttevv/
[07:39:32] <thomedy> okay i can be a good sport for sure but it might take  a sec
[07:39:37] <thomedy> and i like your name
[07:39:48] <codeAssassin> ;)
[07:40:35] <thomedy> i gotta think of a way to make the full effect more concise for jsfiddle
[07:40:38] <codeAssassin> sandoo: you mean waiting on the ajax call to finish?
[07:41:02] <codeAssassin> sandoo: btw your function names sound really german: "zeupdate" lol
[07:41:06] <ezio> codeAssassin, what's our creed?
[07:41:35] <superchu> wtf
[07:41:52] <ajpiano> nothing is true, everything is permitted
[07:41:53] <ajpiano> woo
[07:41:53] <caniuse> ajpiano: http://i.imgur.com/2TjxP.gif
[07:41:55] <sandoo> codeAssassin : yes, before starting again. going to make a screenshot of my problem
[07:42:00] <ajpiano> sandoo: you should use a flag
[07:42:03] <codeAssassin> ezio: our creed? lol
[07:42:18] <eago> hi, I am having problems selecting elements that have display:none in the css
[07:42:21] <ezio> nothing is true, everything is permitted
[07:42:24] <znow> laszlof: https://gist.github.com/e9d9578ac0b295a75dee
[07:42:28] <thomedy> you know what ill have to comeback with that because by the time i finish this js fiddle ill have3 to go back to work
[07:42:35] <thomedy> so nm
[07:42:51] <thomedy> im on  a work break sorry
[07:43:00] <nFFF> ajpiano youll be able to solve this simple issue :D http://jsfiddle.net/fU4Yn/1/
[07:43:12] <znow> laszlof: so far so good, the autocomplete still shows a box, with a list, but without names
[07:43:24] <thomedy> im trying to get this done so i can use it in my portfolio and start picking up clients and also have it asa second business and then quit my multiple jobs
[07:44:11] <laszlof> znow: yeah, you need to parse the data coming back from the ajax call
[07:44:19] <laszlof> using the method I described before
[07:44:25] <ezio> codeAssassin, apparently you've never played assassin's creed
[07:44:25] <sandoo> codeAssassin > this is my problem : http://2ways.fr/myUpload/files/1206/1010628_jspag.jpg ===> Multiple loading before the first event is finished
[07:44:26] <znow> laszlof: yes, sec
[07:44:28] <laszlof> response() should return an array of text
[07:44:31] <znow> laszlof: within the success?
[07:44:36] <ajpiano> sandoo: set a variable and use it as a flag
[07:44:41] <codeAssassin> ezio: i have, the first one
[07:44:41] <laszlof> znow: yep
[07:44:53] <codeAssassin> ezio: then i got stuck on some roof, and i quit
[07:45:21] <ezio> codeAssassin, in the second one, the main character is ezio auditore da firenze
[07:45:49] <sandoo> ajpiano > a variable that I set to true when the event is starting, and back to false when event is hover ?
[07:45:59] <cannjeff> ezio: add this to your JS file $(window).bind('resize', function() {var t = $('#contact_list_table'); t.css({ width: $(t.parent()).width() });});
[07:46:01] <ajpiano> sandoo: yes something like this
[07:46:10] <sandoo> I tryed doing that but couldn't manage to make it work.
[07:46:23] <ajpiano> can't debug it now, the approach is fundamentally sound
[07:46:26] <sandoo> Turning it to true worked, but turning back to false nope
[07:46:31] <znow> laszlof: https://gist.github.com/e9d9578ac0b295a75dee
[07:46:40] <ezio> cannjeff, can you perchance tell me how the other one did it?
[07:46:48] <ajpiano> sandoo: you have to make sure all the functions where you're trying to do the variable have access to it
[07:47:01] <cannjeff> so your second link works  on resize?
[07:47:03] <laszlof> znow: looks closer
[07:48:13] <kollapse> Asking again - Any way I can use :gt(-1) or is there anything like :gte() ?
[07:48:30] <ezio> cannjeff, yup.  that's the example i'm working from
[07:49:09] <laszlof> kollapse: use .filter
[07:49:11] <cannjeff> kollapse you can use an OR like so $(":gt(0), :eq(0)"); that is essentially a greater than or equal selector
[07:49:13] <sandoo> ajpiano : I did that  http://jsfiddle.net/Ttevv/3/ but didn't work
[07:49:17] <ezio> cannjeff, if i copy the example table over the one i've made
[07:49:18] <ezio> works
[07:49:22] <znow> laszlof: damn, it looks like it still tries to insert the name and not the actual id
[07:49:22] <ezio> no problem
[07:49:39] <sandoo> Only my main fuction needs accessed to the variable
[07:49:47] <cannjeff> ezio lemme look, theres a ton of JS included on that site, may take a minute
[07:49:56] <ajpiano> kollapse: you can use slice() on a jquery object
[07:49:59] <ezio> cannjeff, np, thanks buddy
[07:50:16] <kollapse> ajpiano: Oh really ? Interesting, that might be the best choice.
[07:50:37] <ajpiano> foreal
[07:51:02] <kollapse> That way I don't need to use :gt(x):lt(y), I can just slice(x,y)
[07:51:59] <codeAssassin> sandoo: its not really clear to me yet what you're trying to accomplish
[07:52:24] <ajpiano> nFFF
[07:52:25] <ajpiano> http://jsfiddle.net/fU4Yn/1/
[07:53:25] <codeAssassin> sandoo: can you provide some html context/
[07:55:06] <znow> laszlof: you there? :)
[07:55:44] <laszlof> somewhat
[07:55:50] <cannjeff> ezio: they do the same thing, binding onto the Resize event of the window and then resizing their elements when that event is triggered. if you're curious where in their code it is, check out gebo_common.js it starts right around Line 9
[07:56:10] <kollapse> ajpiano: Is .slice() in any way slower than :lt():gt() ?
[07:56:18] <laszlof> you're going to need to console.log the data elements in each step and make sure its just returning an array of names to the response
[07:56:24] <ajpiano> kollapse: it's considerably faster
[07:57:05] <ezio> cannjeff, where does it target those specific divs though ... i even grepped that code for dt_a which is one of their ids so it must be matching on class and i have all the classes it has
[07:58:52] <znow> laszlof: http://imgur.com/xEOY8
[08:00:20] <sandoo> codeAssassin > My Html code is dynamic code. Think of it I have a database with 100 articles on it. I use pagination pages and only show 10 articles at the same time. When I reach the bottom of my page, I want it to automaticly load the next 10 articles. Right now it works but as you can see in my screenshot, It doesn't wait to load the extra data. I need a control to make it sure to wait my
[08:00:21] <sandoo> current article loading is finished before starting to load the next 10. Dunno if you understood me xD ?
[08:00:24] <ezio> cannjeff, that's the ultimate issue ...
[08:00:30] <toughguyhlve> Say you did something like 'if (window.location.href.indexOf("?aspxerrorpath") >= 0) {' How could you say, alert(' THE URL REQUESTED WAS: * ');
[08:00:33] <sandoo> I also tryed to unbid/binf on/off
[08:00:34] <laszlof> znow: whatever you're logging on line 74 looks correct
[08:00:44] <ezio> cannjeff, also
[08:00:45] <ezio> also
[08:00:45] <laszlof> erm, 75
[08:00:47] <ezio> umm
[08:00:55] <ezio> you'll notice that's not how they do it at all
[08:00:56] <znow> laszlof:           console.log(result);
[08:01:05] <ezio> their table example has a width of 100%
[08:01:11] <ezio> that fixes it up
[08:01:17] <laszlof> should be working then. if you're passing that to response
[08:01:17] <cannjeff> ezio: Ya know what, they're using the event binding for resizing other elements (the side_bar mostly), it appears that they're using a jQuery Plugin called DataTables (www.datatables.net) that handles the resizing in the same manor. The code is in the jquewry.dataTables.min.js file so good luck reading it :p but thats how they're doing it
[08:01:22] <znow> laszlof: https://gist.github.com/e9d9578ac0b295a75dee
[08:02:08] <ezio> cannjeff, yes data tables is a very widely used plugin.
[08:02:22] <ezio> k i'm going to reask my question in a different way
[08:02:34] <cannjeff> ok
[08:02:37] <cannjeff> shoot
[08:03:02] <repair> is it a riddle way? :)
[08:03:15] <cannjeff> repair i hope :p
[08:03:18] <Storm3y> Anyone know of a script that resizes an image to a certain size but doesnt destort it? Fit to crop?
[08:03:40] <ezio> can anyone tell me why the first table is not width: 100%.  the second example gets table widths of 100%.  i have a feeling this has to do with something not being matched properly, but i have all the classes setup.  any ideas?    http://206.248.142.234:52170/company_profile http://tzd-themes.com/gebo_admin/index.php?uid=1&page=datatable
[08:05:21] <ezio> cannjeff, i re did the first one
[08:05:24] <ezio> now both examples are in one
[08:07:15] <znow> laszlof: saw my gist? :)
[08:09:20] <repair> ezio: what you mean 1. table is not 100%? looks to me it is
[08:09:35] <ezio> repair, it's set to a pixel value of 100%
[08:09:39] <ezio> resize the window
[08:09:55] <repair> so?
[08:10:01] <repair> it's still 100
[08:10:23] <repair> wait, no there's something hidden
[08:10:30] <cannjeff> ezio: your width definition in the .table class is getting overwritten, which you probably know
[08:10:39] <ezio> cannjeff, yup
[08:10:48] <cannjeff> okay now that i understand the problem...
[08:12:05] <ezio> repair, the problem is that the top table is getting a pixel value of 100%
[08:12:20] <ezio> repair, the second one, the correct one, gets a width value of 100%
[08:12:23] <ezio> not 731px
[08:12:35] <ezio> when you resize the window horizontally
[08:12:41] <ezio> the table skews
[08:12:51] <ezio> at the top
[08:14:00] <repair> they have different kind of data too, have you tried putting t1 data into t2?
[08:14:05] <cannjeff> ezio: are you editing files right now? my browser is now rendering differently
[08:14:22] <ezio> yup, just giving a more concise viewe
[08:14:25] <ezio> of my issue
[08:14:32] <ezio> that's perfect i think
[08:14:44] <cannjeff> heads up next time is helpful :p
[08:14:53] <ezio> both are identical except for the provider's code
[08:14:53] <cannjeff> debugging changing code isn't easy
[08:15:01] <ezio> agreed, sorry
[08:15:18] <laszlof> znow: i did. However, I dont really have more time to debug it for you
[08:15:58] <ezio> cannjeff, i'm going through it piece by piece now
[08:16:15] <znow> laszlof: trying alot of debugging my self though, but yeah, thanks so far :) the autocomplete gets populated, but it inserts the name in the query instead of the id
[08:16:28] <repair> which link is ezio talking about?
[08:16:46] <laszlof> znow: i thought you wanted the name in there?
[08:16:49] <repair> those tables change everytime i reload
[08:16:56] <ezio>  http://206.248.142.234:52170/company_profile
[08:17:01] <cannjeff> repair: http://206.248.142.234:52170/company_profile
[08:17:27] <znow> laszlof: no, I have always said, that, the list in the autocomplete should show the names, BUT when the I hit the submit button, the ID of the client should be inserted into the db
[08:17:45] <laszlof> oh, well that makes a bit more sense
[08:17:50] <repair> default datatable and horizontal scroll?
[08:17:50] <laszlof> you cant really do that with a text box
[08:18:00] <laszlof> maybe a combo box..
[08:18:08] <laszlof> but i'm not sure how to do that with autocomplete
[08:18:25] <ezio> repair, contacts is the broken table
[08:18:34] <laszlof> alternately you could add some logic in there to populate a hidden field with the ID in it
[08:18:35] <ezio> repair, default datatable is the working one
[08:18:58] <laszlof> so when something is selected from the autocomplete names, it will populate the hidden field with the ID of said name
[08:18:59] <repair> oh yeah i had the scroll on middle
[08:19:21] <repair> there's no data in contacts
[08:20:15] <znow> laszlof: a combo box?
[08:20:24] <repair> it goes to 100% after i resize and then reload
[08:20:25] <laszlof> a drop down list that is editable
[08:20:39] <laszlof> not easily done in html, involves some styles
[08:20:55] <ezio> repair, yup
[08:20:59] <znow> laszlof: not needed, the goal is on the page to show the client names, when a name is selected, and submit button is hit, the ID of the client name is inserted into the db, not the name
[08:21:02] <cannjeff> repair: i believe he wants to know why the table isn't resizing when the window is resized
[08:21:16] <ezio> cannjeff, changing code
[08:21:16] <laszlof> znow: http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/combobox.html
[08:21:31] <cannjeff> ezio: thanks for the heads up
[08:21:41] <repair> there's a window resize function, i think
[08:21:48] <znow> laszlof: no need for that :)
[08:22:11] <ezio> cannjeff, i put my table creator in their setup section
[08:22:20] <ezio> got rid of my js and css
[08:22:45] <laszlof> znow: so you want to autocomplete a name, but have the VALUE be an ID
[08:22:48] <cannjeff> repair: already wrote the code for him, but he's trying to figure out why its happening, I'm curious too
[08:22:50] <laszlof> so when it submits, it submits the value
[08:22:53] <znow> laszlof: yes
[08:22:56] <znow> laszlof: exactly
[08:23:14] <cannjeff> ezio: and hows it look now?
[08:23:23] <ezio> same issue
[08:23:23] <laszlof> yeah, you'll either need to use a combo box, or you'll need to add some logic to insert the ID into a hidden field
[08:23:36] <repair> it resizes fine after you once reloaded it in resized window
[08:23:42] <znow> laszlof: hm
[08:23:52] <laszlof> theres no label/value pair on textbox's
[08:24:04] <laszlof> only on select's
[08:24:30] <repair> i try to avoid that resize, rather let use vanilla html
[08:25:48] <ezio> figured it out
[08:25:51] <ezio> well sort
[08:25:51] <ezio> a
[08:26:04] <ezio> it doesn't like to have aocolumns set
[08:26:05] <repair> what is your resize code anyway?
[08:26:05] <znow> laszlof: yeah.. true hmm
[08:26:29] <laszlof> znow: you'll need to create a "global" to store the id/name pairs
[08:26:31] <ezio> repair, rezie code = css{ .table{ width:100%}
[08:26:50] <laszlof> and then when someone selects a name from autocomplete, have an action that updates the hidden field with the ID
[08:26:50] <znow> so in the autocomplete, one of the events, cant remember which. I should take the data.id and populate it into a hidden field?
[08:26:58] <laszlof> correct
[08:27:08] <laszlof> but you'll probably need to store those in a global
[08:27:17] <znow> laszlof: a global?
[08:27:20] <laszlof> the data element wont be available outside the scope of the ajax call
[08:27:29] <znow> laszlof: true
[08:27:38] <laszlof> http://snook.ca/archives/javascript/global_variable
[08:27:55] <dapingwing> hey , how do i make a line from element a to b curving around element c
[08:28:24] <laszlof> znow: you're halfway there, the rest is probably not too difficult
[08:28:46] <znow> laszlof: hehe thanks, all though, now I cant seem to get my way through
[08:28:49] <laszlof> just remember to remove the name element from your dropdown, or change it to something else
[08:29:16] <cannjeff> ezio: not totally sure why its overwriting the .table class, but another possible fix would be to add !important like so -  width: 100% !important;
[08:29:39] <cannjeff> then whatever is overwriting it will be ignored
[08:29:47] <ezio> cannjeff, thank you a lot for your help.  I'll look into it, i'm sure i'll figure it out from here
[08:29:48] <znow> laszlof: dropdown? :p im still using the text field with autocomplete, that is what the client wants
[08:29:50] <repair> can you put some data on contacts t too?
[08:29:55] <laszlof> erm, yeah
[08:29:57] <laszlof> thats what I meant
[08:30:12] <laszlof> znow: client eh? I'm available for hire you know :P
[08:30:22] <macmartine> I am positioning the jquery ui dialog absolute with the dialgoClass, but the top and left properties are overriding my right, top settings. How can I avoid that?
[08:30:30] <cannjeff> ezio: no worries, using plugins can sometimes be messy :p best of luck
[08:31:09] <znow> laszlof: yeah working on a rather large project for a client, need to change some stuff, which would sound rather simple, but it gets complex (as this prob right now) - well, do you know RoR?
[08:31:32] <ezio> repair, http://localhost/company_profile?company_id=23
[08:31:34] <repair> i'd add same data on both tables and see if they act diffirently first
[08:31:34] <znow> laszlof: I would hire you if I were the project leader :p but right now im the peasant that needs some help with this sh**:p
[08:31:39] <laszlof> znow: some. its probably my least used language right now :P
[08:32:06] <repair> localhost?
[08:32:08] <laszlof> the majority of the projects I handle are PHP/jquery/javascript/shell
[08:32:47] <znow> laszlof: ah yeah, I once were in PHP aswell
[08:32:56] <znow> laszlof: BUT, I switched to RoR
[08:33:08] <ezio>  http://206.248.142.234:52170/company_profile?company_id=23
[08:33:11] <repair> ok
[08:34:01] <dapingwing> so can anyone help me out with this drawing using jquery ?
[08:35:24] <ezio> cannjeff, can you just let me know if my firewall rule blocking 80 inbound is working now?
[08:35:25] <znow> laszlof: saw my private msg?
[08:35:42] <ezio>  http://206.248.142.234:52170/company_profile ... ie can you get there?
[08:35:44] <ezio> now?
[08:35:48] <WhiskerBiscuit> I have an input label  as follows:  <input id="first_name" class="txtbox" maxlength="40" name="first_name" size="23" type="text" />
[08:35:55] <WhiskerBiscuit> shouldnt I be able to access the value with $('#first_name' ).val?
[08:35:57] <repair> you added data with js
[08:36:21] <cannjeff> ezio: nope, no access
[08:36:24] <ezio> tyvm
[08:36:40] <cannjeff> np
[08:37:29] <repair> did you close it?
[08:37:55] <codeAssassin> Bla
[08:38:12] <repair> ezio: did you close it?
[08:38:47] <znow> laszlof:  ?
[08:39:44] <ezio> repair, yup ... all fixed ... the code from the plugin overwrites the value if you set aocolumns
[08:39:55] <shoky> WhiskerBiscuit: .val() , yes
[08:39:59] <WhiskerBiscuit> ty
[08:40:12] <repair> ic it got solved
[08:40:37] <repair> just copied the src and there's like over dozen of scripts in it
[08:41:23] <repair> i wonder if it's really necessary
[08:41:23] <ezio> repair, yup
[08:41:44] <ezio> repair, not all of it and i'll sort out which ones are needed for which pages
[08:41:51] <ezio> it's a turnkey solution
[08:42:08] <ezio> we just bought it and are porting the old code to the new site
[08:42:33] <repair> ic, it's somekind of plugin or so
[08:42:48] <cannjeff> jQuery plugin
[08:43:08] <cannjeff> well dataTables anyways
[08:43:13] <ezio> repair, http://themeforest.net/item/gebo-admin-responsive-template/2440015

[08:43:46] <repair> you bought it, don't they offer support?
[08:44:07] <tocka> How to upload file using jQuery? Would it work if I would pass it through POST and then upload it with PHP ?
[08:44:08] <znow> laszlof: ???
[08:44:36] <cannjeff> tocka: I'm doing that right now, check out https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload
[08:44:45] <tocka> thanks!
[08:45:04] <repair> not very expensive though $16 :)
[08:45:07] <ezio> repair, nope.  and the documntation is seemingly lacking but they have enough examples to _hopefully_ get shit done
[08:45:20] <ezio> repair, for all the headache i hope it saves me ...
[08:45:28] <ezio> yeah pretty decent
[08:45:44] <GAEfan> Hi.  Am new to jquery.  I am trying to iterate over some DOMs, but when I build the array, the .find() method will not work:  http://dpaste.org/HJ5BW/
[08:45:46] <repair> extended licence $800
[08:45:59] <ezio> yeah and we have to buy that
[08:46:01] <ezio> eventually
[08:46:08] <ezio> cause we're redistrubiting this
[08:46:16] <repair> what do you use it for?
[08:46:29] <ezio> but next time i write an app ... definitely going this way
[08:46:35] <ezio> umm ... penetration testing
[08:47:00] <repair> penetration of what :)?
[08:47:01] <ezio> we have a torjan/agent
[08:47:07] <ezio> penetration of windows networks
[08:47:51] <GAEfan> Do I need $(this_array[m])?
[08:47:55] <shoky> GAEfan: http://dpaste.org/PC1YF/
[08:47:55] <tocka> cannjeff isnt there a more simple way to do it? I dont need all those fancy things :/
[08:48:06] <dapingwing> hey , how do i make a line from element a to b curving around element c
[08:48:20] <shoky> GAEfan: this_array.eq(m) would get you what you wanted in the loop. but its much nicer to use .each
[08:48:45] <GAEfan> shoky:  Thank you
[08:50:38] <cannjeff> tocka: https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload/wiki/Basic-plugin thats the basic plugin,
[08:51:05] <repair> file upload to where?
[08:51:06] <tocka> thanks again, lets check how to work it
[08:51:20] <tocka> what do you mean to where? from users pc to server
[08:51:21] <repair> how can js upload files?
[08:51:33] <NoiseEee> repair: xhr2
[08:51:55] <cannjeff> this is simply the client side code to make a http req with a file
[08:52:10] <cannjeff> you'll have to hand the server side code
[08:52:42] <repair> not needing any php at all?
[08:53:31] <tocka> repair of course you need php
[08:53:31] <tocka> :)
[08:53:37] <tocka> cannjeff look at this http://jquery.malsup.com/form/#file-upload
[08:53:45] <cannjeff> something has to handle the request
[08:54:28] <ezio> tocka, there are ways to do this that are more standard
[08:54:44] <ezio> tocka, i did one for http://mybabyname.com
[08:54:55] <repair> sigh
[08:55:09] <ezio> go sign up for an account and upload an avatar
[08:55:39] <ezio> that uses a standard upload from the browser
[08:55:50] <ezio> but still has reporting on the file upload status
[08:57:33] <GAEfan> shoky: Still getting: Object #<HTMLDivElement> has no method 'find'
[08:58:33] <systemfault> GAEfan, It looks like a DOM node to me and not a jQuery object
[08:58:50] <systemfault> GAEfan, $(theVariable).find(...
[09:00:01] <ezio> oh god
[09:00:12] <ezio> amazon has a new site just for fashion accessories
[09:00:35] <ezio> time to reprogram the firewall to stop outgoing connections from my gf's laptop
[09:01:05] <cannjeff> ezio is going broke
[09:01:21] <ezio> i'm changing my credit card numbers
[09:01:47] <GAEfan> system fault, shaky: $(this).find fixed it .  Thank you!
[09:02:01] <GAEfan> bad typing...
[09:02:13] <GAEfan> systemfault: $(this).find fixed it .  Thank you!
[09:02:19] <GAEfan> shoky: $(this).find fixed it .  Thank you!
[09:18:13] <heeton> Why does triggering a .focus() event on an object not trigger .focusOut() events on everything else?
[09:18:52] <NoiseEee> .focus() is a method you can call on an <input> element;  focusOut is a *user* initiated event.
[09:19:50] <cannjeff> heeton check out .blur()
[09:20:22] <WhiskerBiscuit> How can you call a getJSOn function from $("form").submit and capture that value in a variable?
[09:20:51] <game16> Hi anyone here good with D3 Word Clouds?
[09:20:58] <WhiskerBiscuit> What I'm trying to do is get the clients ip address only when  the user hits submit, and put that in a var
[09:23:10] <NoiseEee> WhiskerBiscuit: and how are you going to get the clients IP address from javascript?
[09:23:32] <game16> Or just like, anyway to do non=random word clouds
[09:23:36] <repair> $("form").submit( function () {  $.getJSON("test.js", function(json){  alert("JSON Data: " + json.users[3].name); });} );
[09:23:45] <WhiskerBiscuit> I thought when the client presses submit, it would excute the getJSON call?
[09:24:02] <repair> that does it
[09:24:14] <heeton> cannjeff: blur doesn't get triggered either
[09:24:15] <mmic> hello
[09:24:27] <repair> you only need to write the serverside script
[09:24:38] <heeton> NoiseEee: could you elaborate? Is there a way to emulate a user-click-focus?
[09:24:43] <mmic> Is there anyway to get the response filename from the jqxhr object?
[09:25:34] <heeton> cannjeff: Sorry, so I understand that 'focus' won't trigger that stuff. Is there a way to trigger a focus event that acts just like a users mouse click?
[09:25:39] <NoiseEee> heeton: personally i never got into simulating user-events because its nothing i needed; perhaps you can *call* the functions that the 'focusOut' calls when you 'blur'.   alternatively, yes im pretty sure one can simulate events
[09:25:59] <repair> mmic, why not just return it
[09:26:16] <cannjeff> heeton like setting the focus to a certain element?
[09:26:26] <mmic> repair, could you elaborate? What do you mean, just return it?
[09:26:40] <heeton> cannjeff: yea
[09:26:49] <repair> serverside script just echo "file.php";
[09:27:21] <mmic> ahh.... I see
[09:28:00] <mmic> I have a file download, so I am checking the getResponseHeader Content-type
[09:28:04] <cannjeff> heeton: $('#id_of_element').focus();
[09:28:22] <repair> i don't know if there is a fancier method, i just use simple ones
[09:28:27] <cannjeff> will set initial focus to the element with the id="id_of_element"
[09:28:52] <mmic> Once I have established that the file is to be downloaded, I issue a redirect.... but before doing the redirect, I would like to record the filename
[09:29:08] <mmic> I don't know if this is possible
[09:29:13] <NoiseEee> "record"
[09:30:07] <repair> redirect in serverside?
[09:30:45] <mmic> No, I redirect in javascript... let me show you
[09:30:54] <mmic> where is the pastebin?
[09:31:22] <repair> jsfiddle.net
[09:31:38] <mmic> This is what I do:
[09:31:42] <mmic> if (!/html/.test(xhr.getResponseHeader("Content-Type"))) { window.location.href = lastURL; }
[09:31:43] <tbranyen> appending html5 elements isn't working for me in old ie
[09:31:44] <tbranyen> :-/
[09:31:47] <tbranyen> its supposed to work right?
[09:32:03] <tbranyen> I'm getting https://github.com/Modernizr/Modernizr/issues/325
[09:32:05] <socialhapy> ★ Github API: no issue found
[09:32:13] <mmic> So I issue a redirect when the content-type is not HTML
[09:32:49] <toughguyhlve>  ★ shoky is my favorite  ★
[09:33:03] <mmic> In other words, I know it will be a file download, but before this download, I will like to record the name of the file that is being downloaded. How can I do this with JavaScript?
[09:33:18] <tbranyen> hrm i guess append is still broken
[09:34:52] <ignaciogiri> Anybody can take a look at this http://tinyurl.com/6uqdjmq, I need to change colors while scrolling
[09:35:33] <mmic> repair, I don't think it's possible....
[09:36:07] <repair> what isn't?
[09:36:57] <mmic> repair, can you think of a way then? I have been beating my head trying to figure it out....
[09:36:58] <voda> hi everyone, I am trying to fire an event when a certain link is clicked.  The problem is that nothing happens.  So far I have been attempting with a single alert.  http://pastie.org/4074417 are my attempts.  I should mention that the link appears after a form has been submitted, and once the link is clicked, it disappears again and shows the form
[09:37:06] <repair> redirecting, sure if you do redirect in js after ajax call it doesn't matter
[09:37:50] <mmic> But before the redirect, I want to record the name of the file that is being downloaded... How can I do this in JavaScript?
[09:38:00] <repair> ajax
[09:38:07] <NoiseEee> mmic: send the name of the file along with the resposne
[09:38:37] <repair> i told that already
[09:39:01] <shoky> voda: so the link isn't in the DOM when you make the .on call ?
[09:39:03] <mmic> I don't understand? I am issuing an ajax call to a program that sends back a file to be downloaded
[09:39:30] <repair> mmic, i don't think you understand ajax well enough
[09:39:42] <mmic> Then when I detect that file, I do a redirect to that same program, so the download can happen without ajax
[09:39:56] <voda> shoky I thought the .on is acknowledged when the link is there
[09:40:08] <shoky> voda: no
[09:40:14] <mmic> repair, I don't think you understand my problem
[09:40:25] <NoiseEee> mmic: {"responseType":"file","fileName":"something.dot","filePath":"path/to/file/redirect"}
[09:40:42] <repair> that is also possible :)
[09:41:04] <shoky> voda: either bind it like that AFTER its in the dom, or delegate the event to some container element, e.g.:  $('#containerElement').on('click', 'a.ajax-processed', function() { ... } )
[09:41:17] <voda> shoky how would I be able to have a way of "doing something" when that link is added to the dom, but only when it is clicked
[09:41:18] <shoky> voda: where the container element is already in the DOM
[09:41:56] <shoky> voda read about event delegation. see ?on
[09:41:56] <bot-t> .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements, including delegation and live binding. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[09:42:35] <mmic> Sigh, none of you understand... Let me explain, please..... I am using ajax and sometimes I call a program that will start a download (let's say a ZIP file)... I don't know the name of that ZIP file. It's dynamic....
[09:42:56] <NoiseEee> mmic: we do understand, you're doing it wrong
[09:43:08] <NoiseEee> mmic: a "download" is just a redirect
[09:43:18] <NoiseEee> mmic: change the info you're sending back to make it more sensible
[09:43:18] <mmic> yes, I know
[09:44:01] <mmic> This is in my success handler: if (!/html/.test(xhr.getResponseHeader("Content-Type"))) { window.location.href = lastURL; }
[09:44:02] <voda> I did shoky and I really don't get it...I tried this as well... http://pastie.org/4074417
[09:44:25] <mmic> lastURL is the url for the program that will redirect to the downloaded file
[09:44:40] <shoky> voda: put it in $(document).ready( function() { ... } )
[09:44:40] <NoiseEee> mmic: change. the. way. you. are. doing. things.  your.current.way.is.not.flexible.and.makes.no.sense.unless.youve.defined.lastURL.somewhere.else, which.also.makes.no.nses
[09:45:14] <mmic> Yes, I define lastURL somewhere else

[09:48:22] <voda> shoky I'm afraid that still isn't working
[09:48:23] <voda> http://pastie.org/4074417
[09:48:32] <NoiseEee> mmic: so you're just trying to "store" that value somewhere/somehow?  what does "record" mean to you? in a cookie?
[09:48:36] <voda> but I appreciate the help...I wish I knew what it was
[09:48:45] <shoky> voda: jsfiddle.net
[09:49:13] <mmic> No, it's in a variable, it's the url that the Ajax call uses
[09:49:34] <voda> shoky, since I am using Drupal,,,it is what is making my life tough.  It's nesting a lot of "elements"...
[09:49:48] <mmic> The url is the program that does the redirect for the download
[09:50:14] <shoky> voda: that div.links is in the DOM on page load?
[09:50:52] <voda> shoky ... no.  :/
[09:51:03] <shoky> great
[09:51:10] <shoky> <shoky> voda: where the container element is already in the DOM

[09:51:47] * toughguyhlve gives shoky his brownie
[09:51:52] <shoky> ;]
[09:52:55] <voda> shoky I just removed the div.links so since div.#zone-header-wrapper is always there, how come it doesn't work?
[09:53:26] <shoky> voda: how would i know without seeing your page?
[09:53:36] <shoky> er
[09:53:42] <voda> shoky :D
[09:54:02] <shoky> i can prove to you that it works, if you want :\\
[09:54:18] <voda> apologies shoky... I did forget i can show you.. http://www2.trace.org/
[09:54:33] <voda> on the home if you scroll just a little is that little form
[09:55:03] <voda> after you enter an email, just make one up if you don't want to join lol and submit a link appears
[09:55:13] <voda> it is when that links appears I want to "do something"
[09:55:42] <voda> or maybe I should mention that what I really want to do is have a piece of javscript work again after the link is clicked
[09:55:56] <shoky> eh
[09:56:04] <toughguyhlve> question, shoky.
[09:56:09] <toughguyhlve> http://pastebin.com/N0wqdvNG
[09:56:14] <shoky> voda: you're on jquery 1.4.4
[09:56:21] <shoky> voda: upgrade to 1.7.2 please
[09:56:37] <voda> oh my gosh..
[09:56:47] <voda> ok thanks.. let me do that..
[09:56:51] <toughguyhlve> Basically when a user gets a 404, they get directed back to our home page with a modal that comes up saying 'Please check the URL and try again.'
[09:56:57] <c0pp3rnick> I have one for all of you firebug users: how to enable completion in expanded console (the big one)?
[09:57:15] <shoky> voda: and learn to look at your browser's javacript console
[09:57:22] <c0pp3rnick> (yes, I'm aware that this ain't the right place to ask, but still)
[09:57:25] <shoky> voda: ctrl-shift-j or f12 or smth in most browsers
[09:57:38] <toughguyhlve> The 404 is detected by a url string '/?aspxerrorpath='
[09:58:08] <toughguyhlve> Is there any way to output the URL in a paragraph element, minus the aspxerrorpath
[09:58:09] <toughguyhlve> o_O?
[09:58:17] <toughguyhlve> If that makes any sense at all
[09:59:05] <shoky> uhmm
[09:59:48] <toughguyhlve> lol
[09:59:57] <nVee> I am using window.location.reload(); with a jquery dialog box on close. The problem is in firefox it then appears to ask the resend dialog for post. Is there a way around this?
[10:00:08] <shoky> doesn't your serverside know the URL ?
[10:00:18] <shoky> toughguyhlve: what part is giving you trouble?
[10:00:47] <toughguyhlve> Basically, the URL ends up adding a '?aspxerrorpath=' to any urls that 404
[10:00:55] <shoky> oh
[10:01:24] <shoky> well that's something i would do on serverside..
[10:01:31] <toughguyhlve> Hmph.
[10:01:34] <shoky> but you can do it in javascript if you want.. what's the prob?
[10:01:47] <shoky> you got window.location.href
[10:01:48] <toughguyhlve> You saw my pastebin right?
[10:01:57] <shoky> yah
[10:02:10] <toughguyhlve> so, you see on Line 17
[10:02:18] <shoky> there shouldn't be any script tags there
[10:02:37] <toughguyhlve> it was an example
[10:02:37] <toughguyhlve> lol
[10:02:49] <toughguyhlve> I'm trying to output the URL, minus the 'aspxerrorpath' string
[10:03:14] <voda> thanks for your help shoky, its going to take me a few mins before I can update jquery since I am using drupal
[10:03:25] <shoky> so... you get the URL you want, and set the text of that <p> to the URL, with jquery
[10:03:35] <WhiskerBiscuit> this posts to a php page and ignores return results
[10:03:36] <WhiskerBiscuit> $.post("test.php", { name: "John", time: "2pm" } );
[10:03:47] <WhiskerBiscuit> how can I get and examine return results?
[10:03:48] <toughguyhlve> So, say someone goes to http://domain.com/broke, the URL then turns to 'http://domain.com/?aspxerrorpath=broke', I'm trying to output text to the P saying 'You tried accessing http://domain.com/broke, but the URL is invalid'
[10:03:55] <toughguyhlve> That's a better way to explain it :3
[10:05:15] <nVee> so in other words is there an alternative to window.location.reload() which does not reload the page, but basically loads a fresh copy of the site?
[10:06:01] <repair> WhiskerBiscuit: $.post("test.php", function(data){alert("Data Loaded: " + data);});
[10:06:22] <toughguyhlve> shoky, you see what I was trying to do, right?
[10:06:38] <WhiskerBiscuit> repair:  but how do I pass in the extra sfuff like name, and time?
[10:07:22] <repair> $.post("test.php", { name: "John", time: "2pm" }, function(data){alert("Data Loaded: " + data);});
[10:08:05] <MrPunkin> if I have a collection of objects and want to do something similar to 'find' on them, but within the own collection, not their descendants… how would I go about that? .is seems to simply do true/false and require a loop or iteration
[10:08:17] <shoky> toughguyhlve: $('.modal-body p:last').text('You tried accessing http://domain.com/' + location.href.slice(location.href.indexOf('?aspxerrorpath=') + '?aspxerrorpath='.length) + ', but the URL is invalid')
[10:08:26] <MrPunkin> filter it seems?
[10:08:51] <toughguyhlve> <:
[10:08:55] <toughguyhlve> Trying now, thanks
[10:09:07] * toughguyhlve gives shoky another brownie
[10:09:20] <shoky> yum. but you need to be able to do simple stuff like that on your own
[10:10:21] <toughguyhlve> I was getting stuck with using slice :3
[10:10:48] <WhiskerBiscuit> repair:  should that show me the response code regardless if there is an error?
[10:10:49] <shoky> just need to find the right index ;P
[10:11:08] <repair> heh, is that a trick Q?
[10:11:27] <NodeX> iirc it's only for success
[10:11:39] <NodeX> ^^  the post thing
[10:12:14] <repair> you should use the errorhandling
[10:13:12] <repair> somebody should rewrite the jq ajax help, newbies don't get it because there is no serverside script
[10:13:44] <laszlof> there shouldnt need to be
[10:14:03] <repair> it would help to understand it
[10:14:09] <laszlof> the serverside script could be in any number of languages. its really beyond the scope of jquery docs
[10:14:19] <laszlof> or, it could be flat text
[10:14:21] <laszlof> or json
[10:14:24] <laszlof> or xml
[10:14:45] <repair> but i bet it's 99.99% php
[10:15:03] <laszlof> i wouldnt say that.
[10:15:11] <laszlof> probably a good percentage
[10:15:13] <laszlof> but not that much
[10:15:14] <Jon47> is there any accepted method for namespacing data attributes?  for example: http://jsfiddle.net/SUFPE/
[10:15:47] <repair> even it's just the majority, if it clarifies the usage of ajax for newbies it should be there
[10:15:57] <toughguyhlve> shoky, Modified it a little bit.
[10:15:58] <toughguyhlve> $('.modal-body p').html('You tried accessing http://' + '<a href="/">'+ window.location.hostname + '</a>' + location.href.slice(location.href.indexOf('?aspxerrorpath=') + '?aspxerrorpath='.length) + ', but the URL is invalid.' + '<br /><br />' + 'Please Check the URL and Try Again.')
[10:15:59] <toughguyhlve> :P
[10:16:05] <laszlof> repair: newbies should learn how to google
[10:16:23] <repair> they don't understand what to search
[10:16:35] <laszlof> "jquery php ajax example"
[10:16:42] <laszlof> thats not exactly difficult to figure out
[10:16:51] <toughguyhlve> laszlof, what's the problem with people coming to ask for help?
[10:17:03] <toughguyhlve> It's easier to talk to a person and talk out a problem they're having, as opposed to searching it
[10:17:09] <laszlof> toughguyhlve: i think you missed the question
[10:17:09] <repair> like this WhiskerBiscuit i've answered him about three times to practically in same Q
[10:17:12] <toughguyhlve> nothing wrong with some human interaction :P
[10:17:19] <laszlof> please read above
[10:17:36] <toughguyhlve> probably did miss it, but saying stuff like 'newbies should learn how to google' was a bit >:/
[10:17:49] <laszlof> you missed the context
[10:17:56] * toughguyhlve shrugs
[10:18:06] * toughguyhlve eats another brownie and minimizes his IRC again
[10:18:57] <repair> if it'll help why shouldn't it be on help?
[10:19:56] <laszlof> its beyond the scope of the topic at hand. It may help some, but it will also probably confuse those who do not know PHP
[10:20:51] <laszlof> its like going to php.net and expecting to find SQL queries in the mysql_query() function
[10:21:07] <repair> you want jq to be orthodox, stricly what's in the bible etc. :)?
[10:21:55] <repair> not even jq, but the help file of jq
[10:22:00] <laszlof> actually, the mysql_query() analogy is a bit too focuses.. It'd be more likely seeing socket programming in C for the fsockopen() function
[10:22:05] <laszlof> focused*
[10:23:14] <repair> perhaps even better would be emphasising that the serverside script needs to set the response value
[10:23:28] <voda> dear shoky if you are still there I did update to the 1.7 ver and am still unable to get it working, here is the page..http://www2.trace.org/
[10:23:28] <lotus> hey, I'm doing Cross domain requests and my server is responding with a pre-flight response to an ajax request.  How can I stop this behavior?  Or rather, maybe, account for it?
[10:23:46] <laszlof> repair: how else would it work? You'd expect the script to print something. heh
[10:23:52] <Kronuz> hello
[10:24:03] <laszlof> do you mean like, print/echo vs. return?
[10:24:15] <Kronuz> hey, what should I use $('stuff', elem) or elem.find('stuff') ?
[10:24:17] <Kronuz> is it the same?
[10:24:42] <shoky> voda: how do i make the links appear
[10:24:45] <repair> all i'm saying that it's somehow blurry, ppl don't seem to geddit
[10:25:29] <shoky> Kronuz: it's the same, use elem.find('stuff')
[10:25:58] <Kronuz> there's no difference in performance either?
[10:26:21] <voda> shoky just fill the form on the home page with a fake email or a real one if you want lol.  the link shall appear
[10:26:26] <hooloovoo> Kronuz: try =)
[10:26:27] <voda> and thanks a bunch!
[10:26:35] <shoky> Kronuz: no it's the same
[10:26:51] <Kronuz> thank you :)
[10:26:56] <toughguyhlve> window.location.hostname won't carry the http://, just the www.domain.com, correct?
[10:26:57] <voda> and shoky I'm thinking that what I really need to do is have that javascript run when the form comes back...
[10:27:15] <toughguyhlve> i can't test it outside of my staging server which is locally hosted
[10:27:17] <shoky> voda: it's not an <a>  ?
[10:27:17] <toughguyhlve> :{
[10:27:36] <voda> http://pastie.org/4074292 only work on page load via document.ready but how can I get it to work when the form comes back
[10:27:38] <shoky> voda: no you should keep using .on with delegation
[10:27:45] <shoky> voda: its not an <a> ??
[10:27:59] <shoky> voda: it's an <input> ...
[10:28:51] <voda> shoky how can that be <a href="/content/front-page-join-form" class="ajax-processed">Go back to the form</a> is what I get when i Inspect element
[10:29:00] <shoky> oh
[10:29:01] <voda> :(
[10:29:03] <shoky> it disappears :\
[10:29:07] <voda> yeah ..
[10:29:18] <voda> I think thats what has me all going batty huh?
[10:29:59] <voda> so instead maybe I just need that javascript to be "active" when the form loads again..but I haven't been able to get that either
[10:30:00] <voda> http://pastie.org/4074292
[10:31:50] <voda> shoky so this is the thing, that form you filled for me, if you notice the text disappears when you "focus" on it.  That was added functionality I added via jquery, and only works on load.  I need it to work when the form "come back" but couldn't get that working via the trials of the last pasties I just sent you.  So my other approach has been to try to "load" it or "do something" when that link is clicked...which has also faile dme
[10:32:10] <voda> btw sorry if I am drving you crazy shoky.  and thanks a billion for this help
[10:33:32] <toughguyhlve> Shoky? Crazy? Never.

[10:39:04] <lotus> hey, using jquery my server is responding differently to a cross-domain ajax request than it is to visiting the page manually.  http://jsfiddle.net/2HUKZ/12/  js fiddle showing ajax request,  http://72.29.80.41/~mylynx/site/bookmarklet/saveData/   php page showing normal response,  releavnt php Code Igniter Controller sourcecode http://pastebin.com/nn0acTXn   --- any advice?
[10:40:30] <ajpiano> lotus: you can't do cross domain ajax requests
[10:40:35] <ajpiano> unless you use CORS
[10:40:43] <ajpiano> ?sop workaround
[10:40:50] <ajpiano> damn bot.
[10:40:51] <laszlof> just write a local PHP script to proxy the requests
[10:40:54] <lotus> ajpiano, I'm using cors.
[10:40:58] <toughguyhlve> By default, Google doesn't crawl over ajax content, correct?
[10:41:04] <shoky> voda: you have other stuff handling your clicks...
[10:41:07] <lotus> laszlof, I do not have acces to the pages sending the request.  I';m writing a bookmarklet
[10:41:19] <toughguyhlve> Not sure if that's a question that belongs in here, but I'm ajaxing through jQuery.
[10:41:19] <toughguyhlve> :3
[10:41:20] <laszlof> ah
[10:41:32] <shoky> voda: drupal ajax shit
[10:42:01] <voda> LoL shoky...I guess there's interfernce then...it's probably stepping on my code..right?
[10:42:12] <Posterdati> hi
[10:42:58] <shoky> voda: i guess
[10:42:59] <Posterdati> please I need help: I wrote an svg with click event in it and it worked, how can I intercept this same event in jquery for the same svg?
[10:43:21] <shoky> Posterdati: jquery ain't for manipulating svg really
[10:43:52] <voda> ok shoky I guess I'll have to keep looking into it...I know it's a mess with all the existing code there already.  I really appreciate you taking your time for me.  It was very kind of you
[10:43:54] <Posterdati> shoky: I do not want to manipulate svg, only intercept the click event to open a jquery dialog
[10:46:31] <shoky> Posterdati: use jquery.svg.js like i told you a few days ago..
[10:47:03] <Posterdati> shoky: I used it
[10:47:37] <shoky> Posterdati: http://jsfiddle.net/AAHcn/

[10:58:43] <RealityBall> hello when someone has $(document).ready(function); does that mean the function will always run on document load?
[10:58:56] <RealityBall> assume this is in a script file put in the header
[10:59:26] <RealityBall> or head rather
[11:01:06] <RealityBall> nevermind
[11:02:14] <noobie25> is there a way i can echo out what "this" element is pointing to?  for example <div class='button'>
[11:02:24] <NoiseEee> noobie25: console.log(this)
[11:03:30] <noobie25> NoiseEee,  i tried 'this' but i get this huge object .. and dont' know where to look.
[11:04:04] <NoiseEee> noobie25: then console.log what you want
[11:04:09] <NoiseEee> noobie25: and peek at http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide1
[11:05:34] <thomedy> okay im back... this time with a js fiddle
[11:05:38] <RealityBall> I'm having a situation where if I throw my code in console it works perfectly and it is loading correctly it seems but it doesn't work outside of console...
[11:06:40] <thomedy> i have an odd effect...
[11:06:46] <RealityBall> any general debugging tips for me?
[11:06:56] <thomedy> im getting a animatoin that i dont know where it is coming from
[11:07:25] <thomedy> it doesn't happen all the time so its even harder for me to debug
[11:07:47] <thomedy> http://jsfiddle.net/9zqWW/1/
[11:08:58] <RealityBall> which animation?
[11:09:14] <thomedy> if you hover over men or women container divs you get the sub menu
[11:09:26] <jnsk82> What is the latest version of jQuery?
[11:09:28] <thomedy> then if you click one of the sub menus or the men or women anchors
[11:09:36] <thomedy> usually it happens on womens
[11:09:39] <noobie25> NoiseEee,  perfect thanks on the slide
[11:09:56] <thomedy> it will slide left to its spot and then freak out and slid out of the screen again and then finally back
[11:09:57] <NoiseEee> noobie25: np, good luck
[11:09:58] <thomedy> wtf?
[11:10:17] <thomedy> clearly im doing somehting wrong but i cant figure out what
[11:13:41] <thomedy> i dont know im stumped
[11:13:49] <thomedy> maybe it has somehting to do with propogation
[11:14:23] <shoky> h
[11:16:53] <thomedy> shoky...!!!help please i dont know whats wrong... and i just got off work so im back at it
[11:17:01] <thomedy> i hve a jsfiddle this time though
[11:17:08] <thomedy> http://jsfiddle.net/9zqWW/1/
[11:18:12] <thomedy> i get a freak out on the sub menu sometimes where it animates out of the screen and then back in again
[11:18:23] <thomedy> usually on the womens not the mens
[11:19:48] <notjrbauer> if I'm using a modal on my page, is it better to create the html inside the modal  on the fly with html() or have it already on the page?
[11:20:05] <culp> im using jquery autocomplete and am wondering how i can have the selected item be unselected on a keypress
[11:23:09] <thomedy> i know i ll use fire bug how do you use that stack watch thing
[11:25:44] <shoky> thomedy: im trying..
[11:26:31] <thomedy> im so confused it is going in such a great direction but my code is juvenile and im trying to  be an adult coder
[11:26:48] <thomedy> i just cant figure out what is wrong right now and thank you so much
[11:32:17] <tomasm-> hi, how do I loop through the keys set in an object, even if the object has none? without accidentally looping over object methods, like each(), etc
[11:36:03] <tomasm-> god I hate javascript sometimes
[11:36:04] <thomedy> shoky are you still working on it if not i understand
[11:36:31] <zoned> .
[11:39:28] <shoky> thomedy yes
[11:40:46] <thomedy> may i offer this suggestion mostly to myself but for your opinion
[11:41:14] <thomedy> i think better then blindly clearing the queue i have already named the function but now i can clearQueue, with a name
[11:42:25] <toddWork_> i want to capture the click on a parent object no matter which child is clicked. possible?
[11:43:21] <thomedy> if yo uwant to capture a click send in an event and event.target will give you your element im pretty sure
[11:43:49] <toddWork_> thomedy: right, but then i want a particular parent no matter which target is clicked.
[11:44:19] <thomedy> once you have the target just run $target.parent() and that will only go up one parent
[11:44:27] <thomedy> parents() will go till you find  a selector
[11:44:34] <thomedy> if you dont name a selector it will grab them all
[11:44:49] <toddWork_> thomedy: ok, i think parents() is what i'm looking for. thanks
[11:45:01] <thomedy> parents('selector')
[11:45:05] <thomedy> that might help
[11:45:22] <thomedy> if im wrong people can say so
[11:46:27] <toddWork_> is there something like hasParent() ?>
[11:46:48] <thomedy> you know i think so but im not sure
[11:46:54] <toddWork_> or isChildOf
[11:47:03] <ezakimak> isn't that standard css selector syntax? parent > child
[11:47:13] <toddWork_> i want the reverse
[11:47:14] <hooloovoo> toddWork_: if( $("#el").parent().length > 0 )
[11:47:40] <toddWork_> hooloovoo: good ole length. good idea. thanks.
[11:47:49] <hooloovoo> toddWork_: will always be true tho
[11:48:01] <hooloovoo> unless you're on like... document or something
[11:48:18] <toddWork_> 1 minute; i'll try it out.
[11:48:31] <hooloovoo> hmmmm, maybe you can do like parent(".selector")?
[11:48:49] <toddWork_> yeah, i thought that was implied.
[11:55:07] <shoky> thomedy
[11:55:10] <shoky> i think i got it
[11:56:02] <thomedy> oh holy jesus thank you cuz
[11:56:04] <shoky> thomedy: http://jsfiddle.net/9zqWW/2/
[11:56:06] <thomedy> im spit ballin here
[11:56:19] <shoky> its something i already tried before but didnt work for some reason. now it does ;D
[11:56:35] <thomedy> i REALLY REALLY APPRECIATE it but if you wouldn't mind explaining the difference
[11:56:42] <shoky> sec
[11:57:22] <thomedy> how the hell did you do that
[11:57:24] <thomedy> your amazin
[11:58:26] <toddWork_> asdf
[11:58:32] <toddWork_> works.
[11:58:37] <toddWork_> thanks hooloovoo
[11:58:51] <toddWork_> i had to use closest('foo').length . . . .
[12:00:04] <shoky> thomedy: it's the first thing i told you.. as simple as adding overflow:hidden to overflow-container
[12:00:09] <b_52globe> hi guys
[12:00:38] <thomedy> i just added it to the page it isn't working
[12:00:39] <b_52globe> anybody know a tutorial about jquery slider , when yu move an element of the slider a second slider move as consequense ?
[12:01:03] <tomasm-> hi, is there a way for an asynchronous event handler to simply pause a form submit until it gets completed, and then continue the submit if everything's ok? I originally had a preventDefault() in the callback for the failure, but it doesn't wait for completion before the form submits.. I need a way to resume a form submit
[12:01:20] <shoky> thomedy: i just put that single change here:  http://jsfiddle.net/9zqWW/3/
[12:01:51] <Guest61484> is there any way to iterate through ui tabs in an array like manner such as "for (i=3; i <= tab_count; i++) tabs[i].text(tabs[i + 1].text());"
[12:02:55] <thomedy> okay i appreciate it but i now dont think that was it
[12:03:07] <shoky> it fixes the fiddle, no?
[12:03:11] <thomedy> im taking a break to spend time with my wife and kids ill head back to it
[12:03:20] <thomedy> i applied it to my page
[12:03:38] <thomedy> it moves the menu to the middle instead of the left side where i want it
[12:04:30] <shoky> wait did you copy the js from my fiddle too?
[12:04:43] <shoky> (i deleted some stuff there just for testing..)
[12:04:55] <thomedy> from your js fiddle yea
[12:05:02] <shoky> ah no dont take any js from there
[12:05:07] <shoky> dont take anything from there
[12:05:13] <shoky> except overflow:hidden on overflow-container
[12:05:18] <shoky> one change.
[12:05:41] <thomedy> ha thats funny then i will defately need t understand you say you just added overflow:hidden on overflow-container
[12:05:44] <ezio> anyone know why i would get a Uncaught: RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded when simply including jquery.validate.js
[12:05:45] <ezio> ?
[12:07:16] <shoky> ezio: you're sure that that's the source of the error..?
[12:07:24] <shoky> just including it?
[12:07:30] <shoky> not running any code?
[12:09:13] <RealityBall> how do you run something as soon as the page loads?
[12:09:14] <ezio> shoky, done changing shit ... line 47 of company_profile.js is causing it
[12:10:05] <RealityBall> for some reason $(document).ready(function() { runthis(); } isn't working for me
[12:10:29] <shoky> ezio: link?
[12:10:49] <shoky> ?doesnt work @ RealityBall
[12:10:49] <bot-t> RealityBall, What do you mean it doesn't work? What happens when you try to run it? What's the output? What's the error message? Saying "it doesn't work" is pointless.
[12:10:59] <ezio> http://206.248.142.234:52170/company_profile?company_id=26
[12:11:36] <shoky> ezio: can't connect..
[12:11:42] <ezio> derrp
[12:11:49] <RealityBall> shoky: okay so the width is supposed to change on an element when the function is run but it doesn't change though events in document.ready like onclick work...
[12:12:03] <shoky> ?demo @ RealityBall
[12:12:03] <bot-t> RealityBall, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[12:12:42] <ezio> shoky, can you get to it now?
[12:12:54] <shoky> nope
[12:13:16] <rhizmoe> hm
[12:13:31] <shoky> now it's waiting for csi.gstatic.com...
[12:13:58] <ezio> shoky, do you have chrome?
[12:14:03] <shoky> yah
[12:14:15] <ezio> ff it wont' load at all
[12:14:24] <ezio> try again
[12:14:29] <RonaldoMcDonald> When checking that a jquery plugins arguments are correct, what's the proper way to handle errors? is throwing an exception good or bad?
[12:14:36] <xboi209> how would i make a button that I can click and it'll add text to a textarea
[12:14:59] <shoky> ezio: no go
[12:15:02] <ezio> grr
[12:15:30] * toughguyhlve slaps shoky around a bit with a large trout
[12:15:37] * shoky slaps toughguyhlve around a bit with a wakeboard
[12:15:41] <toughguyhlve> Are you multi-talented and also have some knowledge with ASP?
[12:15:43] <toughguyhlve> :>
[12:15:54] <shoky> no knowledge of ASP ;>
[12:15:57] <xboi209> how would i make a button that I can click and it'll add text to a textarea
[12:16:02] <toughguyhlve> my brain can't even form a sentence right now. Bleh
[12:16:19] <toughguyhlve> Tuesdays suck worse than Mondays :<
[12:16:54] <RonaldoMcDonald> toughguyhlve, I don't know, that was a pretty good sentence right there.
[12:17:00] <ezio> shoky, one more try ??
[12:17:05] <shoky> xboi209: http://jsfiddle.net/xxSxS/
[12:17:10] <ezio> if that doesn't work i'll have to pee on it
[12:17:21] <shoky> ezio: k its loading
[12:17:40] <ezio> stupid firewall
[12:17:56] <shoky> im not getting an error :\
[12:19:31] <shoky> ezio: but you have a lot of code, some of it uses the validation stuff. so what makes you say that 'simply including jquery.validate.js' is causing the error?
[12:21:29] <ezio> shoky, whenever i remove it, it doesn't happen
[12:21:29] <shoky> wow firefox sucks :\
[12:21:34] <ezio> yup
[12:21:44] <shoky> ezio: yeah but you have a lot of code there that probably has a lot of bugs causing this error
[12:21:48] <ezio> i'm trying to see what code i can rip out
[12:21:58] <ezio> yeah
[12:22:09] <shoky> so its not the inclusion of jquery.validate.js :\
[12:22:10] <ezio> k
[12:22:17] <ezio> lemmy tinker more
[12:22:51] <shoky> jesus what a shitty browser
[12:22:53] <RealityBall> okay
[12:22:57] <RealityBall> my code works in jsfiddle
[12:23:05] <RealityBall> http://jsfiddle.net/AwMJH/6/
[12:23:10] <RealityBall> but it won't work on the real page
[12:23:55] <RealityBall> when I run it on the real page the width of cholder doesn't change, the slides don't move on click
[12:24:00] <shoky> what do you have in your page that you didnt put in the jsfiddle
[12:24:06] <RealityBall> just pictures
[12:24:31] <RealityBall> what changes do the frameworks make?
[12:24:54] <RealityBall> because I noticed that in some fiddle frameworks if I change the onload or onready it doesn't work
[12:25:05] <RealityBall> maybe my framework isn't set properly if that makes any sense?
[12:25:25] <shoky> it jsut wraps your code in an onload/onready handler..
[12:25:38] <RealityBall> oh...
[12:25:43] <shoky> leaving it on onLoad is fine
[12:25:45] <RealityBall> maybe I should do that...
[12:25:48] <shoky> oh,.
[12:25:52] <shoky> :)
[12:25:54] <RealityBall> haha
[12:26:08] <RealityBall> so I would wrap everything in onload or onready?
[12:26:08] <shoky> $(document).ready(function() { .... })
[12:26:09] <shoky> plz
[12:26:12] <RealityBall> okay
[12:27:27] <RealityBall> lets see if its fixed
[12:28:00] <RealityBall> does it make sense to have two on ready handlers within each other?
[12:28:42] <shoky> no
[12:29:05] <RealityBall> so a $(document).ready(initshow); within a document.ready(function(){
[12:29:06] <gnarf> any other @txjs attendees?
[12:29:22] <gnarf> RealityBall: no it doesn't
[12:29:24] <shoky> RealityBall: it wont harm anything probably, but no it doesn't make sense
[12:29:35] <RealityBall> oh okay
[12:29:41] <RealityBall> thanks I'm testing different things
[12:29:52] <gnarf> RealityBall: the "inner" one should be immediately executued
[12:29:59] <gnarf> but it makes no sense
[12:30:20] <RealityBall> it still isn't working damn it
[12:30:46] <RealityBall> okay now it is
[12:30:53] <RealityBall> hahahaa
[12:30:54] <RealityBall> wow
[12:31:03] <RealityBall> I hate missing something so simple
[12:31:22] <RealityBall> I just assumed that if the functions were there you didn't have to wrap everything
[12:31:30] <RealityBall> just run the initialization function
[12:31:47] <shoky> you have to wrap anything that accesses the DOM
[12:31:49] <RealityBall> on document ready
[12:31:55] <shoky> such as:  var slides = $(".scontent");
[12:31:56] <RealityBall> ahhhh thank you very much
[12:32:00] <RealityBall> now I know
[12:32:19] <RealityBall> oh lawd
[12:45:14] <RonaldoMcDonald> When checking that a jquery plugins arguments are correct, what's the proper way to handle errors? is throwing an exception good or bad?
[12:46:33] <lotus> hey, jquery error in ie9: window.JSON.parse({"logged_in":0}); gives "invalid character" ?
[12:46:37] <lotus> the json is valid
[12:46:49] <lotus> that line is from jquery 1.7.2 line 564
[12:47:22] <sacho_> show repro code
[12:47:39] <lotus> that line.  In the console
[12:47:57] <lotus> sacho_, window.JSON.parse({"logged_in":0}); put into the javascript console in IE9 causes error
[12:48:07] <sacho_> how is that a jquery error
[12:48:15] <lotus> it's line 564 of jquer 1.7.2
[12:48:23] <lotus> That's the original source of the problem.
[12:48:36] <lotus> I'm running $.parseJSON
[12:49:08] <sacho_> it bloody isn't
[12:49:41] <lotus> sacho_, IE9 says "SCRIPT1014: Invalid character
[12:49:42] <lotus> jquery.js, line 564 character 4"
[12:49:58] <sacho_> ok
[12:50:02] <sacho_> so show YOUR CODE
[12:50:05] <sacho_> that reproduces this issue
[12:50:23] <lotus> okay
[12:50:44] <sacho_> also {"logged_in":0} is not json
[12:50:58] <sacho_> '{...}' would be'
[12:51:09] <RonaldoMcDonald> Line 564 of 1.7.2 source: 			return window.JSON.parse( data );
[12:51:50] <lotus> sacho_, that could certainly be the problem.  hold on putting  it into jsfiddle.  Thanks for the help
[12:51:59] <RonaldoMcDonald> lotus, you got the bootleg copy lol.
[12:52:21] <lotus> RonaldoMcDonald, I replaced data with the json data I was getting returned.
[12:52:29] <lotus> RonaldoMcDonald, sorry to confuse
[12:56:58] <lotus> okay sacho_ and RonaldoMcDonald :  http://jsfiddle.net/EKSVy/3/  in ie9
[12:57:06] <lotus> then click "submit"  and the error comes
[12:57:08] <lotus> but it works in chrome
[12:58:32] <ignas__> anyone knows why using class="validate: {required: true}" wouldn't work while class="required" would? I'm using the jQuery validate plugin
[12:59:00] <sacho_> what a massive abuse of classes
[12:59:26] <lotus> sacho_, how can I improve?  :)
[12:59:34] <lotus> oh, his classes
[12:59:36] <lotus> I get it
[12:59:42] <sacho_> I was talking about the jquery validate plugin
[12:59:53] <ignas__> :)
[13:00:10] <ignas__> well this way makes the validation rules more dynamic I gues
[13:00:12] <ignas__> s
[13:00:45] <ignas__> still anyone knows why?
[13:01:06] <ignas__> is there an option that i need to enable or something?
[13:01:16] <alexwait> I'm looking for some resources on how jquery/sizzle interacts with the browser's dom access and how they could fail. "low level" stuff I am assuming?
[13:01:33] <RonaldoMcDonald> lotus, are you sending the json back using the correct headers?
[13:01:58] <lotus> RonaldoMcDonald, probably not.
[13:02:27] <lotus> RonaldoMcDonald, mainly just access control allow origin
[13:03:02] <RonaldoMcDonald> lotus, are you using php on the backend?
[13:03:17] <lotus> RonaldoMcDonald, yup, and codeigniter
[13:03:38] <lotus> RonaldoMcDonald, looks like content-type is set to text/html
[13:03:46] <RonaldoMcDonald> Try this BRO header('Content-type: application/json');
[13:04:12] <RonaldoMcDonald> .. before you echo out the json
[13:06:13] <lotus> RonaldoMcDonald, content-type set to json
[13:06:38] <lotus> Actually, it seems that even though the "response body" is {"logged_in":0}, the data being sent to the callback is the request data?
[13:07:00] <lotus> RonaldoMcDonald, shuger.
[13:07:18] <lotus> RonaldoMcDonald, it's the onLoad callback for the XDR handler.
[13:07:21] <sacho_> lotus, the problem is exactly what I said
[13:07:34] <sacho_> your data has already been parsed
[13:07:39] <sacho_> it's already an object
[13:08:15] <lotus> sacho_, thank you.
[13:10:34] <lotus> sacho_, you're right.  I was using "data" again for the XDR (which runs in IE instead of the jquery ajax request).  However, in the XDR I use data as the request data and not the response data (bad practice, I know ;)  I have to use xdr.responseText instead
[13:11:11] <sacho_> mm
[13:12:10] <alexwait> I'm having trouble finding good resources for Sizzle. Any recommendations? :D
[13:12:29] <alexwait> documentation is 404'd https://github.com/jeresig/sizzle/wiki
[13:14:36] <en3r0> hello
[13:15:33] <en3r0> looking to memic the "donation sliders" on http://www.humblebundle.com/   Is that even what you call them though? nothing is turning up on my searches
[13:16:18] <rverdes> hi guys, first time here, kind of new to js and jquery. i need some advice if it's possible. I'm trying to make a textbox in which you can have "bubbles", a-la Google+ post textbox. I've noticed they use contenteditable="plaintext-only", so I gave it a try. The problem is, when i have a contenteditable button (ie the bubble) inside the contenteditable div as the first element (no text before), I can't "left-arrow" to add text before 
[13:17:35] <rverdes> Looking at G+, i've noticed they have quotation marks before and after the bubble, in the html:   <div contenteditable="true"> " " <button ... /> " " </div>  - so you can jumb before and ahead of the button even if there's no text. But the quotation marks arend visible on the page. How is this done?
[13:18:09] <arungpt> whats google+?
[13:18:15] <alexwait> lulz
[13:18:18] <rverdes> :))
[13:18:41] <PKKid> Whats the fastest way to set a class on potentially 10K-20K items?  Right now I am doign a $.find for each element, which is terribly slow.. :(
[13:18:44] <arungpt> sorry dude, im a js noob
[13:19:05] <arungpt> PKKid: regex + string processing the txt file
[13:19:07] <laszlof> PKKid: set it to a parent element
[13:19:12] <PKKid> unfortunatly, I can't use a simple class selector, the items are user selectable (like a file browser).
[13:19:29] <rverdes> arungpt well me too, that's why i need some advice :P not sure if you're trolling about what's google+ or not
[13:19:41] <NoiseEee> PKKid: in no way should there be 10-20k items in a document
[13:19:49] <arungpt> i was trolling lol sorry if i derailed interesting in your question :-P
[13:19:55] <PKKid> laszlof, Ican't do that because it's a pick and choose which items are selected.
[13:20:06] <skylamer`> PKKid set them on server may be
[13:20:12] <laszlof> so you want to apply the class on click?
[13:20:15] <rverdes> no problem :P
[13:20:22] <PKKid> NoiseEee, It's a file browser, and we support up to 100,000 files in a directory.  perhaps I should paginate? :(
[13:20:29] <alexwait> yes. pagination for sure
[13:20:32] <NoiseEee> PKKid: i should think so
[13:20:35] <alexwait> the peformance on a set that size will blow
[13:20:40] <skylamer`> or do "endless scroll " xD
[13:20:49] <PKKid> laszlof, I do. But when they shift + click a few thousand items at once, its terrible slo
[13:20:51] <NoiseEee> PKKid: so, a user is supposed to make sense out of seeing 100,000 files at one time?
[13:21:14] <_ask001> $(<iframeid>).contents($("<script></script>")).attr("src", url) throwing access denied in IE7 even if the url is of same domain as parent ...
[13:21:37] <_ask001> any solution to workaround this ?
[13:21:44] <PKKid> laszlof, I have the start and end item in the range of 4,000 items or so.  Right now I do a selector lookup, and its SO slow. I am curious is using the sibling class may be faster?
[13:22:11] <_ask001> it is working in FF though
[13:23:33] <laszlof> PKKid: interesting.. I'm trying to think of a faster way to do it.
[13:23:37] <PendulumDreamsWK> Ok, tough question.  Searched and found lots of examples not using jquerys api.  I've got some tabs and know the selected tab:
[13:23:39] <PendulumDreamsWK> $('#tabs').tabs('option', 'selected');
[13:23:40] <PendulumDreamsWK> What I need now is to get the text out of the selected A tag.  But I'd like to do this though an api not using css selectors.  I'd also prefer not to touch the data $('#tabs').tabs().data('tabs') directly because that isn't really going through an api.
[13:23:42] <PendulumDreamsWK> Does anyone know a way to get the selected LI or A tag though an api?
[13:24:04] <laszlof> PKKid: maybe add a div "on top" of the element with the style you want, and just do a .show() on it
[13:24:29] <nobitanobi> What should I add if I have a hide() to an element, but I want ot make sure the element exists?
[13:24:31] <alexwait> $("option:selected", $("#tabs")).text()
[13:24:32] <laszlof> i assume you're just hilighting the row anyways (if its like a file browser)
[13:24:54] <laszlof> so just add a blueish layer over top of it with like a 40% opacity
[13:25:00] <PKKid> laszlof, I imagine the selector lookup for each item is the slow part. Would using .next() be faster?
[13:25:02] <laszlof> and have it display:none by default
[13:25:26] <laszlof> PKKid: im honestly not sure. if its the selector grouping thats slowing it down there likely wont be an easy solution
[13:25:34] <PendulumDreamsWK> This doesn't return anything alex: $("option:selected", $("#tabs"))
[13:25:35] <PendulumDreamsWK> $("option:selected", $("#tabs")).length
[13:25:37] <PendulumDreamsWK> 0
[13:25:55] <PKKid> laszlof, It's not a grouping.  I am doing a lookup for each item individually.. (because I don't know how to select a range of items.
[13:26:10] <laszlof> can you paste the code you're using?
[13:26:15] <laszlof> just a sample of it anyways
[13:26:31] <PKKid> yea, give me a few minutes? :D
[13:27:06] <alexwait> Pendulm: Are you applying a class to the selected one? Is this a list  or a select?
[13:27:27] <laszlof> PKKid: sure
[13:28:29] <rverdes> ok i've returned with a friendlier and more concise question. I JSFiddled it ^_^ http://jsfiddle.net/k9HRX/ Any suggestions?
[13:28:37] <RonaldoMcDonald> PendulumDreamsWK, what's wrong with just doing: $('#tabs option:selected')
[13:28:45] <PendulumDreamsWK> What I actually want is to know the text and url of the selected tab so I can do a history.replaceState({index : $('#tabs').tabs('option', 'selected'), tab.text(), tab.attr('href'));  But of course I don't know how to get the a tag.
[13:29:33] <PendulumDreamsWK> RonaldoMcDonald: That is a css selector to get it.  That's not using an api to get the tab.
[13:30:43] <en3r0> anyone know off hand of a tutorial or existing code to copy the siders on http://www.humblebundle.com/
[13:32:01] <PendulumDreamsWK> Also $('#tabs option:selected') doesn't actually work because the tab isn't an option the html is like this: <ul class="ui-tabs-nav ui-helper-reset ui-helper-clearfix ui-widget-header ui-corner-all"><li class="ui-state-default ui-corner-top"><a href="#batches_tab">Batches</a></li><li class="ui-state-default ui-corner-top ui-tabs-selected ui-state-active"><a href="#results_tab">Results</a></li></ul
[13:32:03] <PendulumDreamsWK> >
[13:32:32] <alexwait> you're going to need to apply some kind of class
[13:32:34] <alexwait> or a click event
[13:32:38] <alexwait> to the anchor tags
[13:32:49] <alexwait> if it 's tot he anchor tags, you can just use $(this).text()
[13:33:19] <PendulumDreamsWK> I already have a click select even on the tabs but I can't use that for what I am doing because the code I need must run in a window onload event.
[13:33:51] <alexwait> I guess I don't understand the ordering of your events. you want ot know which one was selected previously on page load?
[13:36:12] <libin> could someone please tell me who can i use a variable that has declared in a jquery function from another jquery function
[13:36:17] <PendulumDreamsWK> Here is actually the function I've got.  And the commented out part is where I'm trying to get the element.  It is all I'm missing:
[13:36:19] <PendulumDreamsWK> $(function () {
[13:36:20] <PendulumDreamsWK>     'use strict';
[13:36:22] <PendulumDreamsWK>     var selecting_by_javascript = false,
[13:36:23] <PendulumDreamsWK>         on_select = function (e, obj) {
[13:36:25] <PendulumDreamsWK>             var tab = $(obj.tab);
[13:36:26] <PendulumDreamsWK>             if (!selecting_by_javascript) {
[13:36:28] <PendulumDreamsWK>                 history.pushState({index : obj.index}, tab.text(), tab.attr('href'));
[13:36:29] <PendulumDreamsWK>             }

[13:37:54] <libin> how can i call a variable declared in a function from another function
[13:38:36] <alexwait> don't delcare it in that function
[13:38:41] <alexwait> or have the declaring function return it
[13:38:42] <alexwait> ;)
[13:39:32] <ezio> http://206.248.142.234:52170/company_profile?company_id=23 <- can anyone tell me why i get an error that fieldEdit isn't on the jquery object
[13:40:21] <alexwait> what is "fieldEdit"?
[13:40:24] <alexwait> is that a plugin?
[13:40:34] <ezio> alexwait, a plugin i made
[13:40:51] <PKKid> laszlof, You still there?
[13:41:01] <alexwait> it's not being registered correclt
[13:41:03] <alexwait> or it's not incliuded
[13:41:04] <netta> hi..could anyone tell me why this does not work :/ http://jsfiddle.net/VjV9e/
[13:41:05] <libin> is there no other way?  this is my code: http://pastebin.com/RQa5DHDB
[13:41:15] <libin> i want to access the variable hours
[13:42:14] <laszlof> PKKid: yes
[13:42:49] <PKKid> laszlof, This is essentially what I am doing: http://jsfiddle.net/8QfQC/8/
[13:43:10] <PKKid> laszlof, You can see at even 1000 items, its already slow.
[13:43:33] <patie1> hi, is upcoming .link() something like two-way databinding with UI refresh (something like in knockoutjs) ?
[13:43:57] <PKKid> laszlof, The idea is that the user can shift + click the items in the list.  I am similating them shift+clicking all but 5 items.
[13:44:09] <jeffsmykil> Do Darius or Greg from Bocoup ever frequent here?
[13:44:11] <laszlof> yeah
[13:44:20] <laszlof> let me play with it for a bit and see if I can come up with anything better.
[13:44:26] <libin> patiel : r u familiar with knocout?
[13:44:29] <alexwait> netta: http://jsfiddle.net/VjV9e/3/
[13:44:32] <alexwait> check it out
[13:44:32] <libin> knockout*
[13:44:33] <alexwait> you had a ""
[13:44:35] <alexwait> in your ""
[13:44:36] <alexwait> ;)
[13:45:01] <patie1> libin: no im not :/ but i like databinding with ui auto refresh
[13:45:23] <alexwait> netta: you shouldn't really be doing a load event for a dom element
[13:45:26] <alexwait> use $.ready()
[13:45:42] <jeffsmykil> ajpiano: you around sir?  Not a coding question
[13:45:56] <patie1> libin: ant tihs looks somethink like that http://dev.michaelrog.com/js/datalink/changedata.html
[13:46:56] <netta> thank you alexwait :)
[13:47:02] <alexwait> netta: no problem! :D
[13:47:08] <shoky> uh
[13:47:14] <PKKid> laszlof, WOAH!
[13:47:21] <PKKid> http://jsfiddle.net/SsbdF/1/
[13:47:21] <laszlof> PKKid: i'm not really sure this is an accurate way to simular clicks
[13:47:25] <alexwait> netta: What do you use to edit JS? If you were using a good program it would have highlited this issue before you even pressed Save
[13:47:27] <laszlof> sbdF/1/
[13:47:38] <laszlof> bleh, simulate
[13:47:45] <laszlof> hey, there ya go
[13:47:56] <laszlof> so apparently .next() is a lot faster
[13:48:05] <netta> alexwait eclipse
[13:48:05] <PKKid> laszlof, It is pretty accutate, I am simulating them clicking the third item, then shift+clicking the last item.  In turn, all items between the two clicks would be selected
[13:48:28] <shoky> PKKid: http://jsfiddle.net/8QfQC/10/
[13:48:53] <laszlof> ^ thats good
[13:48:58] <skylamer`> some cpu burn http://jsfiddle.net/8QfQC/11/
[13:49:00] <laszlof> i hadnt thought of .slice()
[13:49:04] <netta> alexwait i notice in the fiddle the alert still doesnt fire however :I(
[13:49:17] <alexwait> what is the purpose of that alert?
[13:49:25] <alexwait> I've never bound to a onload event
[13:49:30] <alexwait> for a specific element
[13:49:34] <alexwait> are you wanting to alert
[13:49:40] <alexwait> after you append?
[13:50:07] <PKKid> shoky, Woah, that even faster than using .next()! Thanks. :D
[13:50:32] <laszlof> still takes a few for 100K rows :)
[13:50:51] <shoky> ;]
[13:52:12] <netta> at alexwait yes
[13:52:27] <evasivx> if jquery can only fade css properties with number values, could i fade text on mouseover to a different color using rgba?
[13:53:20] <laszlof> PKKid: it appears to do 10K rows in about a second
[13:53:21] <PKKid> laszlof, I think nothing is even happening with 100,000 rows
[13:53:26] <laszlof> yeah
[13:53:38] <laszlof> http://jsfiddle.net/8QfQC/13/
[13:53:43] <laszlof> added timers
[13:54:18] <laszlof> i dont think javascript was meant to handle that many rows
[13:54:23] <PKKid> laszlof, lol
[13:54:28] <laszlof> however, pagination is your friend
[13:54:37] <laszlof> or like someone said earlier, live tables
[13:54:39] <PKKid> but, this is WAY better than what I had still
[13:54:49] <laszlof> basically ajax tables that load when you scroll to the bottom
[13:54:52] <PKKid> whats a live table?
[13:55:04] <PKKid> ohh, like only load the first 1000 rows
[13:55:08] <laszlof> yeah
[13:55:11] <PKKid> when they scroll down, I load the next 1000?
[13:55:14] <laszlof> correct
[13:55:29] <PKKid> the problem with that, you'll still hit 100,000 rows if you scroll all the way down
[13:55:34] <laszlof> yep.
[13:55:36] <PKKid> unless i start removing the top 1000.. lol
[13:55:39] <laszlof> probably best to just paginate it
[13:55:40] <shoky> why would you do that
[13:55:46] <laszlof> use jquery datatable
[13:56:00] <laszlof> if you really expect someone to have 100K rows
[13:56:21] <PKKid> its uncommon, but we want to scale as much as possible
[13:56:33] <PKKid> I wonder how Dropbox does it.
[13:57:26] <shoky> scaling? clientside?
[13:57:27] <laszlof> PKKid: it looks like it will handle up to ~ 60K rows without a problem
[13:57:35] <laszlof> but it kind be a jsfiddle likit
[13:57:36] <laszlof> limit*
[13:57:39] <laszlof> might
[13:57:43] <laszlof> damn, i cant type today
[13:58:15] <laszlof> yeah, it hoses at 65K
[13:58:20] <PKKid> that makes sense
[13:58:27] <laszlof> 65535?
[13:58:40] <PKKid> laszlof, yep, makes sense
[13:58:52] <shoky> its one of dem numberz!
[13:58:56] <PKKid> lol
[13:59:06] <PKKid> Is that the max array size or something?
[13:59:19] <laszlof> there must be
[14:01:35] <shoky> wat? max array size?
[14:01:37] <shoky> no..
[14:02:45] <shoky> ?eval new Array(1000000)[999999] = 'sup'
[14:02:45] <caniuse> shoky: 'sup'
[14:02:57] <laszlof> 61372 is the max that is working with that code
[14:03:02] <laszlof> no idea why
[14:03:06] <laszlof> might be a jsfiddle thing
[14:03:17] <shoky> yea but that code is dealing with a table and css classes
[14:03:21] <shoky> not 'an array'
[14:03:34] <laszlof> the point being, something is limited
[14:03:42] <shoky> aye
[14:04:01] <Storm3y> If I were to find the height of a pargraph in a div tag. Would var currentPHeight = $('#biotext p').height();
[14:04:05] <Storm3y> would that work?
[14:04:07] <laszlof> technically it would be 61374 since the for loop starts from 0
[14:04:16] <shoky> Storm3y: does it?
[14:04:54] <shoky> i need lmftfy.com :\
[14:05:30] <PKKid> laszlof, The exact number it breaks is: 62383
[14:06:41] <PKKid> laszlof, Interesting that the numberi t breaks for you is smaller than for me.
[14:07:25] <PKKid> laszlof, And... 70,000 works in FF.
[14:08:08] <PKKid> 100,000 works in FF.. it's a chrome thing.. :-/
[14:08:10] <PKKid> whatever..
[14:08:16] <PKKid> good enough for me, but very interesting.
[14:08:25] <Storm3y> shoky - It does :) Cheers
[14:08:30] <Storm3y> Uploading the file to the wrong place.
[14:13:36] <libin> whats the error in this script http://pastebin.com/tm36551n . the hour is not get calculated
[14:13:55] <raj> I wanted to have a div reveal its contents when clicked, otherwise I want a message "Click to redeem code". What's a good way to do this? I'd preferrably like the clicked contents rendered, and the message to just be some sort of curtain
[14:14:24] <raj> as in, the "Click to redeem code" to be some sort of curtain
[14:18:11] <Storm3y> Now to figure out how to do an ifstatment on an paragraphs height
[14:18:21] <sebastian_o|> hey guys
[14:18:29] <raj> hay is for horses
[14:18:58] <sebastian_o|> when you have an autocomplete, how can you set the id of its <ul>?
[14:19:14] <sebastian_o|> I didn't find a way to navigate to it (assuming you have 3 in the same page)
[14:21:40] <raj> sebastian_o|, I just post with the name on the element
[14:21:46] <raj> as long as it has class='autocomplete'
[14:22:34] <sebastian_o|> raj: problem is I have 3 autocomplete fields in that page
[14:22:45] <raj> the fields should have different names
[14:22:58] <sebastian_o|> aah I get what you mean but I really need to discern which is which
[14:23:04] <sebastian_o|> that's why id
[14:23:12] <raj> well, it posts with a name
[14:23:24] <raj> and with .focus, use `this`
[14:23:26] <sebastian_o|> exploring..
[14:24:41] <raj> $('.autocomplete').autocomplete({/*some settings*/}).focus(function() { $(this).autocomplete('search') })  or something along those lines
[14:25:23] <sebastian_o|> but can you reach the <ul>  ?
[14:25:56] <raj> sure
[14:25:57] <sebastian_o|> I'm trying to  get it in the callback that's executed at "open"
[14:25:59] <raj> what's the dom structure?
[14:26:14] <raj> console.log(this) in open
[14:26:20] <sebastian_o|> mm ok
[14:26:27] <sebastian_o|> logging..
[14:26:27] <raj> and then see where you're at
[14:26:28] <libin> raj : cab u please tell me the right way to caculate the wages in it http://pastebin.com/tm36551n
[14:26:51] <raj> libin, what're you looking to do?
[14:26:58] <raj> and what's the problem?
[14:27:23] <libin> i am trying to calculate wages on basis oh hours
[14:27:33] <libin> hours*25
[14:27:46] <raj> so what's the problem?
[14:27:50] <raj> what's 25?
[14:27:59] <libin> just a static number
[14:28:06] <raj> yes, representing what
[14:28:10] <raj> $25/hr?
[14:28:12] <libin> i am just tryin things out
[14:28:16] <libin> hourly pay
[14:28:22] <libin> yes
[14:28:29] <raj> yes, then you need to do 25/this.hours
[14:28:42] <libin> my code is in this file http://pastebin.com/tm36551n
[14:28:50] <libin> i have got it in same way
[14:28:51] <raj> oh, no sorry
[14:29:07] <raj> 25/hr * num_of_hours
[14:29:19] <raj> so yes, you have it right
[14:29:21] <libin> i mean 25* this.hours
[14:29:22] <raj> what's the problem?
[14:29:45] <libin> its not working.. this.hours shows  undefined
[14:29:45] <raj> it looks fine, what's the problem?
[14:29:52] <raj> call the function
[14:30:25] <libin> both are within the same functions
[14:30:26] <raj> this.wages = ko.computed(function(){ var rate = this.hours*25; return rate;})()
[14:30:36] <raj> notice the () at the end
[14:30:43] <libin> ok
[14:30:59] <raj> oh, sorry, this.hours shows undefined?
[14:31:00] <libin> let me try that
[14:31:04] <libin> yes
[14:31:05] <raj> then your ko.observable(hours) is messing up
[14:31:15] <raj> show the complete code
[14:31:47] <pandu101> hi all. Im trying to do some ajax jquery but as soon as I try it, it fails. And I cant figure it out after several hrs of staring and debugging. Could someone take a look at my code? The problem happens on line 39, which is commendted out. Code at --> http://bpaste.net/show/UKtMyaJDchh8IbdTSbyK/
[14:32:18] <libin> http://pastebin.com/RVz5zd6e
[14:32:25] <libin> thats the complete code
[14:32:35] <raj> pandu101, you're posting an object in an incorrect format
[14:32:54] <raj> switch the { } to [] in the second argument of $.get()
[14:33:06] <pandu101> oh... that's it?
[14:33:09] <raj> maybe
[14:33:15] <raj> try it
[14:33:17] <pandu101> k. lemme try it. thanks.
[14:33:54] <libin> raj : this is my complete code http://pastebin.com/RVz5zd6e
[14:34:06] <raj> libin, there's no function observable()
[14:34:32] <libin> ko.observable is an inherited function
[14:34:49] <raj> it's where the issue is, so without seeing that function, I'm not sure I can help
[14:34:58] <pandu101> wow! hot damn! You are right! Thanks Raj! :)
[14:35:06] <raj> wc
[14:35:06] <caniuse> raj: WEB CLOASED >: |
[14:35:15] <raj> i mean welcome
[14:35:28] <smplstk>  cc
[14:35:50] <libin> well.. thats a framework called knockout.js
[14:36:03] <raj> yeah, I'm not familiar with it
[14:36:20] <raj> maybe you need to import the function or something
[14:37:02] <libin> anyone familiar with knockout?
[14:37:34] <pandu101> raj, follow up question. How do i append the result of my json query to the DOM? Code at --> http://bpaste.net/show/UKtMyaJDchh8IbdTSbyK/
[14:37:56] <raj> callback function
[14:38:02] <raj> ?post
[14:38:14] <raj> damn, whatever the trigger is
[14:38:24] <pandu101> im using get
[14:38:24] <raj> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.post/
[14:38:36] <pandu101> ok lemme check that out...
[14:38:37] <raj> oh, right
[14:38:42] <raj> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.get/
[14:38:48] <raj> it's the success function
[14:38:57] <raj> put it before dataType
[14:39:35] <raj> can be a named or unnamed function
[14:40:50] <raj> $.get("request.py", [$('#textbox').val()], function(){/* append the data result here */}, "json"
[14:41:23] <ajpiano> what is .... []
[14:41:27] <ajpiano> supposed to be doing there
[14:41:31] <ajpiano> you can't pass an array as the second arg to $.get
[14:41:40] <ajpiano> it has to be an object or a querystring
[14:42:07] <raj> a map is an array, no?
[14:42:41] <ajpiano> no
[14:42:49] <raj> then what's a map?
[14:42:51] <raj> an object?
[14:42:53] <ajpiano> yep
[14:43:01] <raj> but $.map() returns an array
[14:43:04] <ajpiano> that "map" we use in api docs is ambiguous, i believe it's being changed
[14:43:58] <raj> alright, so pandu101, just at a key for the .val() you have there
[14:44:04] <raj> and put it in {} as you had before
[14:44:19] <mutedb> hosting slow for anyone else but me?
[14:44:39] <lotus> mutedb, probably your internet speed
[14:44:43] <lotus> run an online speedtest
[14:44:53] <raj> I wanted to have a div reveal its contents when clicked, otherwise I want a message "Click to redeem code". What's a good way to do this? I'd preferrably like the clicked contents rendered, and the message to just be some sort of curtain
[14:44:54] <mutedb> I got 30/2
[14:45:12] <libin> raj : i got it, thanks for the help though
[14:45:16] <raj> as in, the "Click to redeem code" to be some sort of curtain
[14:45:21] <raj> np
[14:45:52] <mutedb> it's intermittent, so it might just be me
[14:46:10] <mutedb> I know it can fallback to my local if it completely fails but what about handling slow delivery?
[14:46:37] <raj> ajpiano?
[14:46:51] <retro|cz> Hello. I need to test event is binded (keypress). I found something about $.data. But I can't find relevant informations.
[14:46:58] <nFFF> raj: $('#redeem').click(function(){ $(this).find('#message').css({display:'block'}); });
[14:47:04] <ajpiano> raj ?
[14:47:12] <retro|cz> Is there any way how to determine if keypress is binded on element?
[14:47:16] <nFFF> and just have display:none on the contents from beginnign
[14:47:44] <raj> nFFF, the height would change though
[14:47:50] <nFFF> retro|cz, if you know the specific element yes
[14:47:52] <raj> and I can't use explicit heights
[14:47:56] <retro|cz> nFFF, yes
[14:47:59] <retro|cz> I know
[14:48:01] <ajpiano> retro|cz: you can check the elements data cache with $("#foo").data("events") and digging around in there but it's not recommended
[14:48:01] <nFFF> I believe bound events are in data('evemts')
[14:48:04] <raj> ajpiano, just regarding my question above
[14:48:45] <nFFF> raj, if the hidden content is not the same height as the placeholder content
[14:48:51] <nFFF> then what do you expect to happen? :|
[14:48:58] <retro|cz> I tried $('#capycorder-spec-name').data('events') => undefined
[14:49:03] <retro|cz> But it is binded.
[14:49:17] <retro|cz> Is not data for html5 data parameters used now?
[14:49:24] <raj> that's why I was just trying to have the original content there, just behind the "curtain"
[14:49:30] <nFFF> curtain?
[14:49:51] <nFFF> just put opacity:0 on hidden content if you wish
[14:49:58] <ajpiano> retro|cz: try $.data( $("#capycorder-spec-name")[0], "events") ;
[14:50:24] <retro|cz> ajpiano, undefined also
[14:50:46] <ajpiano> why do you need to find out why the events are attached
[14:50:47] <ajpiano> it's the worst
[14:50:53] <retro|cz> ajpiano, for tests
[14:51:07] <ajpiano> you don't write tests by hacking into the internals of jquery
[14:51:19] <retro|cz> ajpiano, I don't want to.
[14:51:27] <ajpiano> then why are you doing it :p
[14:51:31] <retro|cz> Any suggestion how to test it better?
[14:51:37] <retro|cz> This was my first idea.
[14:51:42] <raj> caniuse opacity
[14:51:42] <nFFF> retro|cz why do you need to test ?
[14:51:44] <caniuse> raj: You can use CSS3 Opacity with Internet Explorer 9, Firefox 2, Chrome 4, Safari 3.1, Opera 9, iOS Safari 3.2, Opera Mini 5.0-6.0, and Opera Mobile 10. http://caniuse.com/#search=css-opacity
[14:51:46] <ajpiano> if you're trying to unit test whether a keypress event is attached properly
[14:51:53] <ajpiano> you bind the event and then simulate the keypress
[14:51:57] <raj> damn
[14:52:05] <retro|cz> ajpiano, with keypress?
[14:52:25] <nFFF> raj, http://jsfiddle.net/FJjWW/
[14:52:38] <ajpiano> you can do .trigger("keypress") but sometimes you actually need to use the browser native cycle (createEvent) for simulating events
[14:52:43] <ajpiano> there is a plugin that wraps that functionality however
[14:52:58] <retro|cz> ajpiano, I'm hacking one chrome extension
[14:53:23] <ajpiano> retro|cz: and then you wre doing $("#foo").data("events") from the console??
[14:53:41] <retro|cz> ajpiano, nope I'm running jasmine tests
[14:53:50] <ajpiano> oh
[14:53:54] <retro|cz> ajpiano, I tried directly in browser also
[14:54:02] <ajpiano> well in browser wouldn't work cause of isolated window
[14:54:07] <retro|cz> And my bind works. But in console is nothing.
[14:54:28] <ajpiano> your chrome extension's `window` and the console's `window` are different windows
[14:54:35] <MrPunkin> Anyone want to weigh in on if it would be better / more semantic to provide the original markdown-formatted forum post for quoting in a data-quote attribute, or in a hidden piece of content?
[14:54:53] <retro|cz> nope. I'm using console of my extension.
[14:55:01] <ajpiano> MrPunkin: you might get screwed putting big peces of data like that in a data attribute
[14:55:03] <retro|cz> My selector selects right element.
[14:55:06] <ajpiano> because of quotes inside the content
[14:55:25] <ajpiano> retro|cz: well in any event, doing the data("events") is the wrong way to go
[14:55:33] <retro|cz> ajpiano, sure
[14:55:47] <retro|cz> ajpiano, so better to fake keypress directly
[14:55:54] <MrPunkin> ajpiano: I was thinking the same thing. I'll hide a piece of content then… or maybe even just pass it as data to the object in question since it is only used for JS
[14:55:56] <retro|cz> ajpiano, ok thanks
[14:55:59] <retro|cz> I'll try
[14:56:24] <ajpiano> retro|cz: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/tests/jquery.simulate.js
[14:56:33] <rhizmoe> when creating modals, is it more common to have hidden divs sitting on the page, or to create them when needed? $('foo').on('click','a.blah', [create div, then bring up as modal]) or likewise...
[14:56:49] <nFFF> When people talk of testing their code, do they not just test it locally on a real page ina  real environment?
[14:56:58] <nFFF> Are there cases when this isnt possible?
[14:57:02] <retro|cz> ajpiano, thanks a lot
[14:57:06] <ajpiano> nFFF: people typically are referring to unit tests
[14:57:13] <ajpiano> when they stay that
[14:57:20] <ajpiano> not just sitting at the computer and watching it work and being like, k seems good
[14:57:39] <rhizmoe> there are browser runners for acceptance testing in a user context
[14:57:41] <ajpiano> rhizmoe: i tend to either create and destroy them dynamically, or reuse a single dilaog and swap its contents
[14:57:47] <ajpiano> i don't like having multiples in the page
[14:58:35] <rhizmoe> ajpiano: excellent, thanks. $('body').append()?
[14:58:39] <nFFF> ajpiano, unit tests are more common in large code bases?
[14:58:57] <ajpiano> more common than what, in small code bases?
[14:59:17] <nFFF> Im struggling to think of what a unit test is or when its used
[14:59:42] <ajpiano> there re numerous blog posts and stuff out there to dig into
[15:01:04] <raj> nFFF, thank you, that gave me a clear visual
[15:01:22] <raj> I just have one question, can this be done without having a div surrounding the '.code' http://jsfiddle.net/thapar/FJjWW/1/ ?
[15:01:38] <nFFF> ajpiano Ill look into it, Im guessing its only useful in professional development :D
[15:01:44] <raj> well, I mean the .code div itself
[15:03:05] <nFFF> raj why?
[15:03:16] <nFFF> how will you change the opacity on the content
[15:03:22] <nFFF> or any style properties?
[15:04:02] <raj> nFFF, not sure
[15:04:35] <nFFF> ..
[15:04:35] <SidGBF> hi all :)
[15:05:00] <i386> Hello'
[15:05:23] <SidGBF> Guys, on jQuery UI Autocomplete, is there a way to, when user clicks on it, show the options that matches the 'nothing' filter?
[15:06:39] <i386> <li id="input1" class="clonedInput"><a id="R_Gmaps" href="#" target="_newtab">This text</a></li> What is the correct way to change -This text- ? I use $('#input1').children(':first').text("Change me"); But it totally ruin the style of the <a
[15:07:12] <raj> nFFF, something like this http://jsfiddle.net/thapar/FJjWW/2/
[15:07:22] <raj> i thought with position absolute on the "curtain" it would be able to
[15:07:59] <i386> II use jquery moblie
[15:08:45] <raj> oh, I see, it's working
[15:08:49] <raj> but I need the curtain to cover the whole area
[15:11:09] <raj> nFFF, or something like this http://jsfiddle.net/thapar/FJjWW/3/
[15:11:31] <raj> but the container overwrites the css property for the child apparently
[15:11:38] <raj> I thought more specific wins
[15:12:28] <nFFF> I have no idea what you are trying to do
[15:13:01] <shoky> yo rajy
[15:16:08] <nFFF> what is wrong with the jsfiddle I made
[15:16:12] <nFFF> what do you want to change
[15:16:20] <nFFF> you keep talking about curtains and shit that makes no sense
[15:19:18] <raj> shoky, what's up kid?
[15:19:34] <shoky> big ol' nothin
[15:19:35] <raj> nFFF, I'm trying not to require an additional div surrounding the `code`
[15:19:49] <raj> what're you doing with sunday nights now?
[15:20:14] <shoky> hmm whacha mean?
[15:20:27] <shoky> ohh
[15:20:32] <Emn1ty> raj: what do you mean an additional div? The curtain?
[15:20:33] <shoky> its mondays here ;)
[15:20:43] <raj> ohh, right
[15:20:43] <raj> haha
[15:20:47] <shoky> raj: nothing :(
[15:21:01] <nFFF> raj, why?
[15:21:03] <raj> Emn1ty, I don't want the code portion to need a div around it
[15:21:18] <raj> cuz I've already built my whole js around the fact that it doesn't have an additional div
[15:21:25] <nFFF> ...
[15:21:28] <shoky> raj if you want to set opacity for those elements, you need them in a container element..
[15:21:41] <raj> damn
[15:21:42] <raj> k
[15:21:50] <nFFF> your going to need another element in there regardless
[15:22:12] <raj> yeah, but putting my current content in an additional div is what's gonna do weird stuff
[15:22:12] <nFFF> whether you wrap it around the code
[15:22:15] <nFFF> or place it infront
[15:22:17] <raj> cuz that code is interactive
[15:22:24] <nFFF> your not making any sense
[15:22:40] <raj> ok, anyway, that's fine, I'll just do it as suggested
[15:22:48] <raj> thanks for the help nFFF
[15:26:21] <nFFF> np
[15:33:05] <eip56> evening all
[15:33:24] <bradmaxs> Hey All,  How can I insert disabled="disabled" into an input using jquery? Thanks.  I thought with .insert but I don't think I am understanding.
[15:34:20] <eip56> could do $('input#thisone').attr('disabled','disabled'); should set that attribute
[15:35:09] <bradmaxs> eip56: thank you.  I knew I was barking up the wrong tree with .insert() :)
[15:35:18] <eip56> Np
[16:15:54] <coldhead> he said he always knew herrrr along the shore linnne
[16:19:43] <yi> hi, i'm using the jquery validation plugin to perform some simple form validation. i'd like to enable/disable the submit button based on whether or not the form is deemed valid. any ideas how to do this effectively?
[16:21:18] <PIKER32> anyone have a sexy solution for adding and removing identifiers ("." or "#") to variables?
[16:21:52] <PIKER32> as in, some kind of pattern instead of just "."+"className"
[16:22:04] <shoky> wat?
[16:22:57] <PIKER32> when passing id strings around
[16:23:12] <PIKER32> then you need to specify . or #
[16:23:16] <Jon47> i think the concatenation operator is pretty sexy
[16:23:23] <PIKER32> when actually doing hte selecting
[16:23:38] <shoky> you didnt mention any selecting before
[16:23:55] <PIKER32> quilty
[16:23:58] <raj> shoky, do you use bootstrap or normalize?
[16:23:58] <PIKER32> guilty
[16:24:01] <raj> .css
[16:24:09] <shoky> raj- nopes
[16:24:14] <raj> k
[16:24:24] <shoky> PIKER32: concatenation is sexy
[16:24:37] <Jon47> you could write wrapper functions or some crap but there's no way it would be as terse or functionally clear as simply concatting the strings
[16:25:01] <shoky> why are you passing id strings around ;<
[16:25:06] <lotus> I pick up girls by suggesting we should concatenate
[16:25:26] <PIKER32> shoky: it happens to lots of guys
[16:26:01] <PIKER32> well, in the case of what im working on, i have the class default spec'd at the top of the literal
[16:26:13] <shoky> wat
[16:26:29] <PIKER32> as kind of a "constant"
[16:26:40] <shoky> no idea what you're talking about
[16:26:42] <PIKER32> var USE_THIS_CLASS_ALOT = "theClassIUse
[16:27:10] <shoky> var USE_THIS_SELECTOR_ALOT = "." + USE_THIS_CLASS_ALOT;
[16:27:29] <shoky> if you want to cache and be sexy :\
[16:28:07] <PIKER32> haha thats where im at - was just checking
[16:28:17] <PIKER32> and its always gotta be sexy
[16:29:16] <rverdes> <div id="d1" contenteditable="plaintext-only"> div1text <div id="d2" contenteditable="plaintext-only">  div2text </div> </div>
[16:29:22] <rverdes> anyone know why $("#d2").keydown() refuses to fire? ... it fires on "#d1", and .click fires on "#d2"
[16:29:47] <crazydiamond> Has . Has anyone problem that ajaxForm plugin don't sends hidden fields' values correctly?
[16:33:54] <shoky> rverdes: when you set the first div to editable you made its whole contents editable including d2, so when you edit them the focus is on d1
[16:33:59] <shoky> or something
[16:37:50] <rverdes> found it... I have to wrap the 2nd div into another <div contenteditable=false>
[16:38:05] <rverdes> oh
[16:38:11] <rverdes> shoky, thanks :P
[16:38:25] <rverdes> didn't see your answer
[16:42:02] <KWhat_Work> Anyone know where $.widget.prototype._setOption is?
[16:43:48] <shoky> KWhat_Work: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/ui/jquery.ui.widget.js#L324
[16:44:13] <thomedy> okay im back
[16:44:48] <KWhat_Work> shoky: $.Widget != $.widget ?
[16:45:14] <shoky> o
[16:45:41] <shoky> um. so i dono what yer lookin for ;P
[16:46:03] <shoky> each widget has its own _setOption ..
[16:46:13] <KWhat_Work> shoky: you gave me the correct answer, I am just trying to figure out why $.widget (which i was using) isnt the same as  $.Widget
[16:46:39] <shoky> first of all they have a different name
[16:47:10] <shoky> 2nd. i must eat. bbs
[16:47:35] <thomedy> what up shoky
[16:47:57] <thomedy> hey question why are you so awesome.. do you work for yourself, how long hav eyou been doing this
[16:48:04] <thomedy> no big deal just curious
[16:52:11] <devnill> is there a way to use css hsla() using $.css()?
[16:55:45] <PIKER32> shoky: you're around quite a bit - whats your gig?
[16:55:59] <PIKER32> (if you dont mind me asking)
[16:58:06] <devnill> @KWhat_Work: Shouldn't it be case sensitive?
[16:58:24] <overra> devnill, $(el).css({background: 'hsla(120, 100%, 50%, 1)'}) works for me
[16:58:34] <KWhat_Work> devnill: of course, what is the difference defined be the devs...
[16:58:48] <devnill> idk
[16:58:53] <KWhat_Work> when should i be using $.Widget vs $.widget
[17:07:44] <devnill> Thanks @overra! I was missing the "%"'s
[17:08:01] <overra> ah, cool np :)
[17:08:23] <thomedy> okay its official i need help
[17:08:33] <thomedy> www.thesartorer.com
[17:08:53] <thomedy> http://jsfiddle.net/9zqWW/1/
[17:09:39] <PIKER32> the right cols not working?
[17:09:45] <thomedy> me?
[17:09:46] <PIKER32> the right two*
[17:09:50] <PIKER32> yea
[17:09:54] <thomedy> theres no submenu in those yet
[17:09:59] <thomedy> thats actually not the issue
[17:10:03] <thomedy> the problem im having is
[17:10:11] <PIKER32> was using my jump to conclusions mat
[17:10:13] <thomedy>  that when you click on one of the submenu's in the left 2 men's work
[17:10:24] <thomedy> womens however
[17:10:27] <thomedy> tends to freak out
[17:10:37] <thomedy> not everyt ime thats why its so hard for me to debug
[17:10:50] <thomedy> cuz i cant figure out what event is causing the issue
[17:10:54] <thomedy> or what code is doing it
[17:11:03] <PIKER32> whats the intended action?
[17:11:17] <thomedy> okay have you clicked on men submenu
[17:11:22] <thomedy> anywhere
[17:11:58] <thomedy> can i assume that you ahve done that
[17:11:59] <thomedy> ?
[17:12:14] <thomedy> if so.. you ll notice that the page slides open to 100%
[17:12:25] <thomedy> width and then the submenu slides to the left under the men link
[17:12:27] <raj> how can I tell which option is checked?
[17:12:29] <PIKER32> yup got the gist
[17:12:30] <raj> http://jsfiddle.net/thapar/6ecAT/3/
[17:12:35] <thomedy> in women however it freaks out
[17:12:45] <PIKER32> they always do
[17:12:47] <thomedy> it slides off the screen unless you click it again when it comes back
[17:13:16] <thomedy> and that can happen on men too but not as much ... the plot thickens
[17:13:33] <thomedy> ... the fact tht the bug isn't consistent is making it difficult to debug
[17:13:36] <raj> is it just me or is jsfiddle messing up?
[17:13:38] <imsky> garble
[17:15:34] <PIKER32> thomedy: the right columns jumping is the "freaking out"?
[17:16:15] <thomedy> okay i knew that was one issue i didn't know that was the cause
[17:16:34] <thomedy> i did have to fix it anyway so i might as well fix it now... and see if it fixes everything
[17:17:02] <thomedy> my plan for that was to give an overal container again outside of overflow-container so taht overflow container would be one div extending beyond and not a floated div
[17:17:11] <thomedy> does that seem like a good idea
[17:17:21] <raj> hola?
[17:18:12] <PIKER32> fyi - sitting in panera bread with WOMEN prob looks creepy to people
[17:18:12] <thomedy> hola, hablas espanol
[17:20:35] <raj> thomedy, necessito te ayudar
[17:21:03] <thomedy> ill try hablo pequito, pero, me amo todos idiomas
[17:21:05] <PIKER32> crap man - i gotta bail - battery is about to die
[17:21:39] <raj> oh
[17:21:55] <thomedy> i love all languages you got me excited... right now im trying to learn french
[17:21:59] <thomedy> but im so busy
[17:22:04] <thomedy> any way work time
[17:22:10] <thomedy> im done working multiple jobs
[17:22:17] <raj> ( V ) shoky, gotham needs you
[17:22:36] <PIKER32> one thing that might smooth things out is chaining the animations with complete callbacks
[17:23:30] <catcher> Is there an easy way to fade in/out css changes? I'm adding a class that adds a border, padding, etc., and removing it takes it away.
[17:23:40] <PIKER32> will check back
[17:23:40] <raj> ?animate
[17:23:44] <raj> ? animate
[17:23:45] <caniuse> raj: .animate(): Perform a custom animation of a set of CSS properties. http://api.jquery.com/animate/
[17:23:59] <engaged> How can I call a function if anything changes on form id #myForm (input, textarea, select, etc.)
[17:24:46] <raj> ? on @ engaged
[17:24:48] <catcher> raj, so I'll use that instead of adding/removing a class, and set the css right in the animate calls?
[17:24:55] <raj> .on()
[17:24:59] <raj> ? .on()
[17:25:03] <raj> damn it
[17:25:07] <raj> what's the other bot's trigger?
[17:25:27] <thomedy> okay that fixed the css
[17:25:28] <raj> catcher, yes
[17:25:32] <raj> since you want animation
[17:25:39] <thomedy> crap you have to make so many containers sometimes
[17:25:40] <engaged> raj: what would it be on though?
[17:25:48] <thomedy> id imagine i should have just planned a bit more a head
[17:25:52] <raj> container
[17:26:02] <thomedy> but i dont always know what this stuff is going to do so i dont know how to plan ahead
[17:26:03] <raj> or whatever selector
[17:26:10] <raj> use variables
[17:26:15] <thomedy> no im talking html so i actuallly meant contiainer
[17:26:17] <raj> and then set the variable
[17:26:28] <engaged> would it be .on("change" or what?
[17:27:03] <thomedy> nope that didn't fix it crap
[17:27:05] <thomedy> i thought i twould
[17:33:04] <thomedy> what is my problemn
[17:33:20] <thomedy> i cant seem to get this to stop floating back around
[17:35:30] <shoky> im batman
[17:36:26] <shoky> raj supp
[17:37:56] <shoky> thomedy: i dont work for myself ;< and ive been coding for around 20 years ;S
[17:38:16] <thomedy> oh you win... im not done in college yet so 3 there and about a year of web...
[17:38:24] <thomedy> but i work 2 jobs to take care of my wife and kids
[17:38:34] <thomedy> so i dont get nearly enough time to develop my portfolio as i would lkike
[17:38:59] <thomedy> im hoping to have this site doen as soon as possible like this week hopefully
[17:39:15] <shoky> ;] so did you figure out the overflow thing
[17:39:26] <thomedy> cuz i stil have to teach myself the 3d canvas version of js so i can do the upgraded desing
[17:39:31] <thomedy> and no im still stumpped
[17:39:34] <thomedy> i just added another container
[17:39:48] <shoky> ic an take another look if you want
[17:39:54] <thomedy> img please
[17:39:58] <catcher> raj, how can I fade instead of the current left-to-right animation I'm getting now? Do I have to install the easing plug to get more options?
[17:40:11] <thomedy> but if you dont mind i need to learn so dont just fix it... please help me be better
[17:40:22] <Apriori204> $().fadeToggle();
[17:40:30] <thomedy> if you fix it i wont mind but im very much so interested in being the best i can
[17:40:39] <shoky> thomedy: well first we neet to fix it ;>
[17:40:40] <catcher> Apriori204, fadeToggle affects visibility, no?
[17:40:54] <shoky> thomedy: ill gladly explain anything i can..
[17:41:00] <shoky> thomedy: so link me ;p
[17:41:16] <Apriori204> it fades selected item til it can be seen then switches visibility to disabled, i believe
[17:41:41] <catcher> Apriori204, I need to keep visibility, just need to change a few css attribs. I'd like to fade to/from them though.
[17:42:13] <Apriori204> You could fade out, change the CSS atttibutes, then fade back in
[17:42:50] <shoky> thomedy: better be quick coz im gonna sleep soon ;p
[17:43:01] <catcher> unfortunately not an option in this case, elements in the container need to remain visible.
[17:43:27] <Apriori204> How can they remain visibile if you are fading from one value to another?
[17:43:59] <catcher> Apriori204, the element inside the container remains visible, the container border comes & goes.
[17:44:12] <Apriori204> ic
[17:44:33] <thomedy> im sorry how do i link you
[17:44:48] <shoky> to your site.. where you added the overflow:hidden
[17:44:54] <Apriori204> so you are just fading the border?
[17:44:55] <thomedy> www.thesartorer.com
[17:44:56] <shoky> and said it still didnt fix
[17:45:00] <shoky> k
[17:45:09] <thomedy> i think i just fixed the submenu for women
[17:45:11] <catcher> Apriori204, that's the goal.
[17:45:12] <thomedy> with stop(true)
[17:45:14] <thomedy> i lov eit
[17:45:26] <thomedy> i am not seeing the erradic behavior yet
[17:45:34] <thomedy> im going to keep trying...
[17:45:44] <thomedy> now to fix that float cuz its necessary
[17:45:48] <shoky> thomedy: so yeah , overflow:hidden fixes it..
[17:45:52] <thomedy> really
[17:46:02] <shoky> you didnt put it in..
[17:46:17] <thomedy> my float: problem is fixed with overflow hidden
[17:46:27] <thomedy> cuz i dont know wher eyou putting that i thought i put it in the most logical spot
[17:46:30] <thomedy> but imust be wrong
[17:46:35] <thomedy> i mostly did it in firebug
[17:46:43] <shoky> oh, you also changed the bg color, ic
[17:46:47] <thomedy> yeah
[17:46:49] <shoky> that was confusing me
[17:46:55] <thomedy> but im going to change it back for the same reason
[17:46:59] <thomedy> cuz i dont want a bandaid
[17:47:09] <shoky> where did you put overflow:hidden ?
[17:47:12] <thomedy> especially cuz this is going in a portfolio for potential clients kind of thing
[17:47:22] <shoky> i toldyou to put it on #overflow-container
[17:47:25] <thomedy> i added a nother container due to this logic
[17:47:44] <thomedy> it was floating because  overflow was holding multipls
[17:47:54] <shoky> dono what u mean
[17:47:59] <shoky> "it was floating"
[17:48:03] <thomedy> if i added a container to overflow container which was one div
[17:48:07] <thomedy> sorry wrapping
[17:48:31] <thomedy> and then that single container extended beyond the overflow hidden it wouldnt wrap
[17:48:41] <thomedy> im kinda spitballing cuz i dont know the dom like i want to yet
[17:48:48] <thomedy> i was thinking about it at work
[17:49:17] <lotus> iloveyouall.

[17:51:16] <shoky> thomedy i see no reason for that extra wrapper div u put
[17:51:27] <thomedy> like i said i dont know the dom like i want to yet
[17:51:30] <catcher> shoky, possible to fade to/from css changes with animate?

[17:51:57] <thomedy> i just moved here in january
[17:52:11] <shoky> sweet
[17:52:14] <shoky> which state
[17:52:16] <catcher> shoky, trying to add/remove a border with a fade instead of swing/linear ease
[17:52:18] <thomedy> im a city person...
[17:52:33] <thomedy> im in iowa for my wife i LOVE my family to death but i hate hate hate iowa
[17:52:38] <shoky> catcher: jsfiddle plz, i donno what u mean
[17:52:44] <thomedy> so for now im here until i build my businesses to take care of us
[17:52:47] <thomedy> then back to the city
[17:52:58] <thomedy> for all of us... next stop chicago. please
[17:53:06] <shoky> plz
[17:54:02] <raj> hey shoky
[17:54:06] <thomedy> i was an improv comic in california but then i made people my wife and i had kids so i had to be an adult
[17:54:13] <thomedy> now im doing
[17:54:17] <thomedy> adult stuf
[17:55:48] <raj> so how do I differentiate btwn which option is selected here? http://jsfiddle.net/thapar/6ecAT/3/
[17:56:12] <Apriori204> the animate function will work, catcher
[17:56:45] <catcher> Apriori204, it's working, but draws from left to right. It'd be rad if it could fade instead..
[17:57:51] <shoky> raj what do you mean?
[17:58:09] <shoky> thomedy: adult comedy?
[17:58:09] <raj> $('select').val() ?
[17:58:21] <raj> like, is All my children selected or Something Hello
[17:58:36] <shoky> wat
[17:58:49] <thomedy> no i write code and work 2 jobs and finish colledge and build business
[17:58:56] <thomedy> i havent performed comedy in 5 years
[17:59:04] <raj> in the fiddle
[17:59:06] <thomedy>  and my soul is wilting
[17:59:06] <shoky> raj there are radio buttons and there's a select, i dont understand which you're asking about..
[17:59:23] <raj> oh, I'm sorry, I mis-spoke
[17:59:27] <raj> I meant the radio buttons
[17:59:31] <shoky> o
[17:59:31] <thomedy> but i love my kids and i love my wife and this is temporary its why i work almost 100hrs a week between all my jobs and this web stuff
[17:59:53] <thomedy> cuz my goal is by my birthday i want to work for myself exclusively
[17:59:54] <Apriori204> Instead of animating it from a border width of say 2px to 0, animate opacity?
[17:59:56] <thomedy> and that is a big goal
[18:00:00] <raj> like, say I even posted without JS, how would I differentiate btwn which was selected?
[18:00:06] <thomedy> but im putting the effort in to not just be talk
[18:00:07] <raj> they both have the same name
[18:00:12] <catcher> Apriori204, but that will fade the contained elements in/out along with it
[18:00:20] <Apriori204> lol
[18:00:26] <shoky> raj usually you give each a different value attribute

[18:34:00] <bmarek> $("input[name=^exp_val2\\[5\\]]") I'm trying this but it does not work

[18:34:52] <bmarek> but no joy
[18:46:59] <arungpt> hey i have what might be a stupid question, how do you make a link in jquery?
[18:47:07] <arungpt> is the only way to update an existing link?
[19:01:53] <rverdes> arungpt: i'm a noob, but i gues you select the parent element, and append your html link: $("#mydiv).append("<a href="http://www.example.com/">example</a>")
[19:03:24] <rverdes> typo with the quotes: $("#mydiv).append("<a href='http://www.example.com/'>example</a>")
[19:03:50] <rverdes> arghhh, another typo $("midiv") .. you get it
[19:06:26] <arungpt> thanks rverdes i ended up doing that
[19:06:31] <arungpt> but with .html instead of .append
[19:22:25] <ProLoser|Work> i need to make a client side 'package builder' similar to this: http://jqueryui.com/download are there any known solutions or suggestsions?
[20:02:10] <Antaranian> hi ladies
[20:02:56] <Antaranian> which is the right channel for asking about QUnit ?
[20:06:41] <danzik171> Antaranian: don't think there's an official, but probably a lot of people here use it.
[20:06:46] <danzik171> official channel*
[20:07:40] <Antaranian> great. having issues with running test in requirejs environment. Only first test runs
[20:08:02] <Antaranian> http://hardstat.antaranian.me/test/
[20:10:52] <danzik171> Antaranian: why call QUnit.stop() in your test file?  and why wrap the rests in a function to begin with, just call test() right in the module.   but anyway, it ran both tests for me.
[20:12:40] <Antaranian> just played with QUnit.start() and QUnit.stop(); to see if that affects. Weird that it isn't rendering 2nd test results for me but renders for you
[20:15:03] <danzik171> but yea, don't even bother returning an object in your test modules.  just run the tests directly imo
[20:17:04] <Antaranian> ok
[20:17:39] <m2iller> :quit
[20:17:46] <rodd> regarding paranoia and maybe 'security', what would be the best approach when you want to retrieve a specific content from your html? 1) set a js var in your html (myApp.title = 'title') ; or 2) just select that same title that is already present in a dom element, say a div?
[20:20:23] <Antaranian> can't say why, but now when I call tests directly in test module, it works correctly. thanks danzik171
[20:21:15] <zz3599> I am trying to build jquery. I have grunt, but when I run grunt it says 'module is undefined'. What is wrong?
[20:27:33] <ZooZoo> whois
[20:33:48] <rodd> regarding paranoia and maybe 'security', what would be the best approach when you want to retrieve a specific content from your html? 1) set a js var in your html (myApp.title = 'title') ; or 2) just select that same title that is already present in a dom element, say a div?
[21:11:53] <coldhead> Eviltwin: whatever happened to you anyway
[21:12:24] <alcuadrado> Can I use jquery to trigger events from my own objects and allow other elements to attach to them?
[21:14:43] <coldhead> alcuadrado: that is fine by me. have fun
[21:14:48] <coldhead> good luck
[21:15:19] <alcuadrado> haha, I mean, has it any feature for that? If not, do you know any library for doing that?
[21:16:02] <alcuadrado> I only know Peter Michaux's evento, but I don't know how maintained and used it is
[21:31:35] <Kogster> so I was wondering if it was possible to use the selector to find all divs with a certain data-name
[21:31:48] <Kogster> or data-foo
[21:32:04] <tw2113> wouldn't that be $('div').data('foo') ?
[21:36:25] <pzero> hi im just trying to do a simple ajax request to get some json data. my browser shows that the network request went through and returned the json data. but the success function isn't fired. http://pastebin.com/CDueC0tP
[21:36:31] <pzero> am i missing something stupid?
[21:37:53] <Kogster> tw2113: hey sorry, no that'd give the actual data in it. I want to select all divs that have data-foo='bar'
[21:37:55] <Kogster> or something like that
[21:38:05] <tw2113> ah good point
[21:38:43] <tw2113> .has ?
[21:38:47] <tw2113> ?has
[21:38:47] <caniuse> tw2113: .has(): Reduce the set of matched elements to those that have a descendant that matches the selector or DOM element. http://api.jquery.com/has/
[21:38:52] <coldhead> pzero: that must mean that jQuery thinks there has been failure, instead of success
[21:39:24] <pzero> coldhead: the browser states status code 200, OK.
[21:39:31] <pzero> is there something i should look for?
[21:39:55] * tw2113 wonders how many people wish to ban pastebin links and require fiddles
[21:40:01] <coldhead> pzero: do you see anything interesting in your console?
[21:40:12] <coldhead> any warnings or error messages in firebug?
[21:40:12] <pzero> nothing at all in console.
[21:40:15] <coldhead> or web inspector?
[21:40:22] <Kogster> pzero: aren't you missing a closing }); ?
[21:40:24] <pzero> no warnings, just a successful network request.
[21:40:49] <Kogster> or for .get, or for $("a    and one for the $(function
[21:40:58] <Kogster> oops, one for*
[21:41:28] <Kogster> or was it just shorthand for the pastebin
[21:41:34] <pzero> sorry, i retyped it to cut out the other cruft, i just missed that in the pastebin, it's there in the live code.
[21:41:40] <pzero> good catch though : P
[21:41:43] <Kogster> kk
[21:41:52] <Kogster> looks right to me
[21:42:03] <coldhead> pzero: i am not sure what the problem is without being able to see it fail. i would try rewriting the .get() with .ajax() and mess with the dataType and other options
[21:42:06] <Kogster> I had some problem when doing that locally
[21:42:10] <Kogster> pzero
[21:42:25] <Kogster> and it worked when I put it online, .getting through http and not file://
[21:42:44] <coldhead> Kogster++ well said, babe
[21:42:48] <coldhead> file:/// no workee
[21:42:59] <tw2113> darn child labor laws
[21:43:01] <tw2113> wait what?
[21:43:05] <Kogster> although I remember fixing that somehow
[21:43:36] <pzero> ah yeah it's running on a test server, maybe it's because im using a dynamic link though. I'll try writing it longhand.
[21:47:00] <martisj> is it possible to toggle two jquery objects?
[21:47:04] <martisj> or selectors that is
[21:47:37] <overra> like $('#thing1, #thing2').toggle()  ?
[21:47:56] <martisj> yes
[21:48:00] <martisj> overra: does that work?
[21:48:05] <overra> should
[21:48:21] <coldhead> it would be so nice if it did work
[21:48:25] <coldhead> sure would make life easier
[21:48:31] <overra> doesn't?
[21:48:34] <martisj> I just saw that I can't do that because i have to toggleClass for the other one :)
[21:48:41] <martisj> so i can't chain them...
[21:48:56] <coldhead> unless you change the classnames?
[21:49:37] <martisj> coldhead: that's true but is there really that much performance gain in making the effort
[21:50:43] <coldhead> how much more readable does it make the code
[21:50:52] <coldhead> that's more important than performance
[21:50:56] <coldhead> do what you gotta do
[21:51:02] <coldhead> http://www.somethinghitme.com/2012/06/06/2d-metaballs-with-canvas/
[21:51:52] <martisj> coldhead: good stuff
[21:54:17] <pzero> if anyone is interested: the reason was that the json was not valid.
[21:54:23] <Koganei> ah makes sense
[21:54:32] <Koganei> better than having to move everything to an external server
[21:54:36] <Koganei> or something
[21:54:43] <pzero> it's on a local server anyway, but yeah : P
[21:55:09] <Koganei> oh yeah
[21:55:13] <Koganei> that IS how I fixed it :p
[21:55:38] <Foo-Bar> oh hey guys ... i had a question about ajax post ... the data parameters look like this .... dates[1]=2012-06-15&dates[2]=2012-06-16
[21:56:04] <srj55> what's an easy way to 'black' out or cover the screen...i could add a div with z-index: 999 and set visible.  is there an even easier way?
[21:56:05] <Foo-Bar> but for some reason, ... the dates array doesn't make it to my php $_request
[21:56:09] <pzero> Foo-Bar: some versions of IE will have problems with the [] characters.
[21:56:21] <Foo-Bar> mkay
[21:56:27] <Foo-Bar> ...so I should switch to json?
[21:56:29] <pzero> yes
[21:57:53] <Eviltwin> coldhead: I got a new job
[21:58:09] <Eviltwin> An internship actually
[21:59:55] <martisj> i've noticed that .removeClass() only removes the classname and not the attribute, does this matter at all or should i use removeAttr('class') instead ?
[22:00:13] <ENQ> doesnt matter
[22:00:26] <martisj> ENQ: thanks :
[22:00:27] <martisj> d
[22:00:29] <martisj> :)
[22:00:46] <martisj> How would i target an element based on its data-number attribute?
[22:03:22] <martisj> can i use the data('number') method somehow?
[22:03:37] <ENQ> i dont get it
[22:03:40] <Koganei> I just asked that earlier
[22:03:41] <Koganei> ?has
[22:03:41] <caniuse> Koganei: .has(): Reduce the set of matched elements to those that have a descendant that matches the selector or DOM element. http://api.jquery.com/has/
[22:03:46] <ENQ> you need to select it?
[22:03:48] <Koganei> was told to me
[22:04:26] <Koganei> haven't checked it though
[22:06:24] <martisj> ENQ: i need to add a class of active to an element with data-number equal to $(this).data('number').
[22:06:28] <martisj> http://jsfiddle.net/martisj/Mtv8b/1/
[22:07:41] <Koganei> martisj: if you find out how, can you tell me? :)
[22:07:47] <martisj> Koganei: yeah :)
[22:09:05] <Koganei> what about $('#div[data-number="4"]') ?
[22:09:12] <ENQ> you need to add the active class to every element?
[22:10:44] <Koganei> martisj ^
[22:11:10] <martisj> ENQ: just one element with a unique data-number
[22:11:20] <Koganei> sorry I meant what I said
[22:11:29] <martisj> Koganei: i'll try it
[22:12:39] <ENQ> so you need to add "active" class to the element witch have your set number
[22:13:29] <martisj> ENQ: yes
[22:13:34] <martisj> Koganei: didn't work ^^^^^
[22:13:51] <martisj> tried: 		listItems.has('[data-number="' + num + '"]').addClass('active');
[22:14:08] <Koganei> hm
[22:14:11] <Koganei> trying here too
[22:15:01] <Cork> martisj: your sure you want has and not filter?
[22:15:31] <martisj> 		listItems.filter('[data-number="' + num + '"]').addClass('active');
[22:15:35] <martisj> just figured it out :)
[22:15:40] <martisj> Cork: filter was the way to go :)
[22:15:43] <Koganei> $('li[data-name="services"]') worked for me
[22:15:47] <martisj> Koganei: ^^^
[22:15:50] <Koganei> ^_^
[22:15:56] <martisj> wooooooooo
[22:15:59] <martisj> Cork: thanks
[22:16:08] <Cork> np
[22:17:03] <Koganei> I just started using jquery last week, and I'm loving it so much <3
[22:17:09] <Koganei> I actually like coding now :p
[22:38:15] <aqeel> hi room
[22:38:31] <aqeel> any used css3pie ...
[22:47:34] <hacks> how do I write .live('click', cb) using .on?
[22:48:02] <Cork> $(document).on('click', 'selector', cb)
[22:48:14] <Cork> 'selector' is what you put in $() before
[22:51:14] <martisj> anybody encountered "unsafe javascript attempt to access frame with URL ......" ?
[22:51:18] <martisj> and heaps of them as well ?
[22:51:23] <martisj> in the chrome dev tools console
[22:51:36] <ENQ> about plugins, should i put defaultOptions in plugin namespace, $.fn.plugin.defaults? or should i use like $.plugin.defaults
[22:52:04] <Cork> martisj: its cross domain frame access
[22:52:28] <martisj> Cork: how can i find out where it's coming from and how can i fix it ?
[22:52:56] <Cork> should have a line numer
[22:53:57] <martisj> some are coming from a plugin :(
[22:54:09] <Cork> do you have a link?
[22:54:14] <martisj> chrome plugin others are coming from facebook
[22:54:18] <martisj> wait youtube
[22:54:26] <martisj> http://www.youtube.com/embed/HyWkB1SYDMs?fs=1&feature=oembed
[22:55:21] <Cork> martisj: try disabling the extensions one at a time
[22:56:28] <martisj> the zotero plugin is onl y causing a coouple
[22:56:33] <martisj> they're gone now,,
[22:56:41] <martisj> but the youtube ones are still there
[22:56:50] <martisj> got 11 from youtube videos
[22:56:54] <ENQ> cool
[22:57:18] <martisj> Port error: Could not establish connection. Receiving end does not exist. miscellaneous_bindings:184 chromeHidden.Port.dispatchOnDisconnect
[22:57:20] <martisj> and one
[22:57:22] <martisj> ^
[23:00:30] <ENQ> can someone help me about plugins?
[23:01:07] <ENQ> then i write $.fn.plugin.default, $.fn.plugin.default.something i do clutter namespace dont i? =/
[23:01:54] <Cork> ENQ: your talking about plugins for your plugin?
[23:02:09] <Cork> or is plugin meant to be the name of your plugin?
[23:02:10] <ENQ> its more like options
[23:02:20] <ENQ> default part
[23:02:46] <Cork> ENQ: your talking about plugins for your plugin?
[23:02:47] <Cork> or is plugin meant to be the name of your plugin?
[23:02:55] <ENQ> ahh
[23:03:09] <ENQ> ok bad example :) plugin is my plugin name :D
[23:03:40] <ENQ> i have $.fn.test plugin and $.fn.test.defaultOptions there is options
[23:04:02] <Cork> ok, then i would set it to $.fn.myPlugin.prototype.defaults
[23:04:21] <Cork> if your plugin is $.fn.myPlugin normally
[23:04:39] <Cork> if your plugin is $.myPlugin.prototype.defaults if thats where your plugin lives
[23:05:16] <ENQ> i see
[23:05:17] <Cork> you don't want to add it to myPlugin.defaults cause then its duplicated for each instance
[23:05:50] <ENQ> thought fn means prototype
[23:05:55] <ENQ> isnt it?
[23:05:57] <Cork> it is
[23:06:01] <Cork> but for jquery
[23:06:06] <ENQ> oh
[23:06:09] <Cork> prototype is only one level
[23:06:22] <Cork> $.fn == jQuery.prototype
[23:06:36] <Cork> jQuery.prototype.myPlugin is a new object
[23:06:45] <Cork> jQuery.prototype.myPlugin.prototype is a new prototype
[23:06:52] <ENQ> i see, well i have some more functions, like $.fn.myPlugin.someFunction = function(){...}
[23:07:01] <ENQ> will change to prototype that :)
[23:07:19] <ENQ> for now my plugin doesnt feel to be made the right way
[23:08:21] <Cork> normally its best to have a plugin constructor that you attach to jquery and host your sub functions internally
[23:08:34] <Cork> so you do myPlugin('function to call')
[23:08:52] <ENQ> i do so
[23:10:44] <Cork> $.fn.myPlugin(command) { if(command[0] !== '_', MyPlugin[command] !== undefined) { return MyPlugin[command].apply(MyPlugin, Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments, 1)); } }
[23:11:27] <Cork> uh... opps
[23:11:34] <ENQ> this i do too :)
[23:11:34] <Cork> $.fn.myPlugin = function(command) { if(command[0] !== '_', MyPlugin[command] !== undefined) { return MyPlugin[command].apply(MyPlugin, Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments, 1)); } }
[23:12:23] <Cork> ENQ: i mean to not attach functions to your object
[23:12:27] <ENQ> ohh.. no its different afterall
[23:12:29] <Cork> but instead normally return jQuery
[23:12:42] <Cork> that way you can chain calls
[23:13:11] <Cork> $(selector).myPlugin('show', 'other params').show().find('something')
[23:14:02] <ENQ> do i have to create prorotype.defaultOptions somehow? to use it
[23:14:20] <Cork> its like any object
[23:14:29] <Cork> its not created or handled by default
[23:14:32] <Cork> its up to you
[23:16:10] <Whirl3d> Good morning all. Can someone suggest a good method for creating unique ids for an event handling subsystem?
[23:17:03] <Cork> ids for event handling?
[23:17:18] <Cork> why would you need ids for them?
[23:17:40] <Whirl3d> Yeah. I am probably doing this all wrong, but I want to create a way to publish custom events and have elements subscribe to those events
[23:18:03] <Cork> ya?
[23:18:03] <ENQ_> sorry, connection failed
[23:18:10] <Whirl3d> I know about .on and custom events...but I am not sure how to implement it with subscriptions...
[23:18:30] <Cork> just $().trigger('my-custome-event')
[23:18:40] <Cork> just $().trigger('my-custome-event', event, extra_data)
[23:18:48] <Whirl3d> Okay.
[23:18:56] <ngharo> just kiss me
[23:18:59] <Cork> jquery will handle the binding and unbinging normally
[23:19:25] <Whirl3d> can you trigger events on objects
[23:19:31] <Cork> yes
[23:19:35] <Whirl3d> cool
[23:24:16] <ENQ_> can i ask again, if this is good example to go https://github.com/addyosmani/jquery-plugin-patterns/blob/master/patterns/jquery.basic.plugin-boilerplate.js
[23:30:21] <papelboyl1> hi.  I have custom attribrutes in a tag called "element". How do I find out which tags are available in a tag?
[23:30:50] <papelboyl1> like for example <mytag attribute1="sometext">text</mytag>
[23:30:58] <papelboyl1> I want to get "sometext"
[23:31:01] <papelboyl1> thanks
[23:34:07] <ENQ_> papelboyl1, use filter method on all selected elements where to look them
[23:37:13] <papelboyl1> i'm looking at the filter function in the jquery website and I'm unsure if this can do that job
[23:38:39] <papelboyl1> I'm actually trying to parse an XML
[23:38:51] <ENQ_> papelboyl1, you need all elements with data-attribute1 DOM element, and need to get its data?
[23:38:52] <papelboyl1> which has multiple "records" in it.
[23:39:38] <ENQ_> not shoure but should work this selector $("div:data-attribuye1")
[23:39:55] <papelboyl1> 1 record would have multiple "mytags" with different attributes
[23:39:58] <ENQ_> ofc fix my typo
[23:40:25] <ENQ_> why you use jquery to do some weird parsing?
[23:40:56] <ENQ_> i think xml can be maped to object, and used in loops or so
[23:42:44] <papelboyl1> thanks :)
[23:53:00] <ENQ_> $.data( element, "tesst") is same as element.data("test")?
[23:54:12] <Haprog> ENQ_: no. "tesst" != "test"
[23:54:44] <zamba> i need to find the id of the table header for the column i'm in.. how can i do that?
[23:54:53] <Cork> ENQ_: yes $.data(target) is the same as $(target).data
[23:55:21] <ENQ_> lol Haprog :)
[23:55:25] <Cork> zamba: on a td click you mean?
[23:55:25] <ENQ_> thanks
[23:55:28] <zamba> Cork: yup
[23:55:58] <Koganei> .parent.attr('id') ?
[23:56:15] <Cork> $(this).closest('table').find('thead td').eq($(this).index())
[23:56:23] <Cork> $(this).closest('table').find('thead td').eq($(this).index()).attr('id')
[23:56:34] <Koganei> huh closest is cool
[23:56:44] <zamba> weow
[23:56:55] <zamba> thanks! :)
[23:56:58] <Cork> np
[23:57:41] <zamba> though i get undefined :)
[23:57:43] <Haprog> Cork seems to assume your "this" is a td
[23:57:48] <Cork> yes
[23:58:03] <Haprog> if it is some child of td you need to get the index using closest also
[23:58:09] <Cork> true
[23:58:33] <zamba> basically i'm creating a coordinate system using a table..
[23:58:45] <zamba> and i need to know in which x,y the user has clicked
[23:58:48] <Haprog> and if you're not using <thead> elements to wrap your header you need to adjust also
[23:59:12] <zamba> the Ys are timestamps (date/time) and the Xs are indexes
[23:59:59] <zamba> it worked now :)
