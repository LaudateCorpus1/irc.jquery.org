[00:00:01] <negi> hey Cork  sorry for that but it's give some error
[00:02:18] <Cork> nice that you're so specific
[00:02:55] <negi> oops any mistake cork
[00:03:54] <negi> sorry ok
[00:05:37] <dziegler> Cork: i remember this fiddle, he posted something similar a few month ago but with music artits if i remember right...
[00:06:21] <Cork> i feel that i'm not energetic enough to care today...
[00:08:41] <dziegler> annnnnnnnd hes gone :D
[00:08:56] <Cork> i've seen him around for a long time
[00:11:44] <Uhkis> i'm starting to think that negis problem is some school assignment
[00:12:28] <Cork> heh
[00:12:51] <Uhkis> ip is always the same, nick changes, fiddle is about the same
[00:14:21] <dziegler> Usually no employed developer has the time to fight with draggable this long time ^^
[00:15:25] <Uhkis> maybe he's getting paid by the hour and decided to get rich ;D
[00:18:02] <RiZKiT> for an a/b testing tool i need code in the format $(selector).action, and i want to perform a function on an element. Currently I'm using $(selector).each(function() { });
[00:18:33] <RiZKiT> is there any other way beside each to do this?
[00:18:51] <Cork> RiZKiT: the question is a bit too generic
[00:19:10] <Cork> and if possible please profile a fiddle
[00:19:12] <Cork> ?paste
[00:19:12] <b-ot> Cork: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[00:21:45] <RiZKiT> Cork: here you go http://jsfiddle.net/3umm7k7f/, but dont blame me for the effect, i have to to it, wasn't my idea
[00:22:14] <Cork> ok, and the question is about?
[00:22:31] <RiZKiT> is there something else then each, which i can use
[00:23:45] <Cork> ah, a typewriter effect
[00:24:05] <prohobo> there's the js forEach
[00:24:05] <RiZKiT> oh yes :-/
[00:24:13] <Cork> RiZKiT: to start with i wouldn't use setInterval
[00:24:23] <Cork> you could also use animate
[00:24:30] <Cork> (it has a step function)
[00:24:38] <RiZKiT> prohobo: ah yeah right
[00:24:49] <RiZKiT> hmm
[00:24:54] <Cork> but you want to loop elements, so forEach isn't a better choice
[00:25:31] <RiZKiT> well i only have one elment so, each is a bit overpowered
[00:25:45] <RiZKiT> animate my be an option have to look at the docs
[00:25:51] <RiZKiT> may
[00:26:10] <Cork> RiZKiT: you could just run it directly on the $() element
[00:26:17] <Cork> no need for the each if you don't feel you need it
[00:26:17] <dziegler> RiZKiT: if you only have on element why you are calling it with .each() ?
[00:26:31] <Cork> though each is very low cost so shouldn't be a problem
[00:27:38] <RiZKiT> dziegler: because our a/b testing tool need the code in the form $(selector).action to poll it every 50ms to reduce ab testing flashes, sound complicated but makes sense
[00:28:17] <RiZKiT> if other solutions just complicate the code i stick to each
[00:28:41] <RiZKiT> just felt like an ugly workaround for my problem
[00:30:31] <dziegler> Im not sure how its implemented in jquery but i guess .each() is only a shiny wrapper for "for(var i in $)" and setInterval should be non blocking so your CPU can do other tasks
[00:31:22] <RiZKiT> well alright i will stick to this solution, thanks
[00:31:23] <dziegler> i guess if you ne refactor the code with .animate() jquery uses setInterval in the background
[00:31:47] <RiZKiT> animate is for css values only, not for attributes, afaik
[00:32:47] <dziegler> possible - i don't use this usually
[00:34:39] <Cork> RiZKiT: http://jsfiddle.net/3umm7k7f/1/
[00:34:44] <Cork> better?
[00:34:59] <Cork> works for infinite number of elements too :)
[00:36:57] <RiZKiT> thank you for your afford, but this code will not work in optimizely, because every code which is not in the specified format will be delayed until domready/onload, that is/was a common pitfall for my collegues
[00:37:38] <Cork> RiZKiT: "in specificed format"?
[00:37:51] <prohobo> what's the blur for
[00:37:55] <prohobo> its not even visible
[00:38:03] <Cork> to make sure the field doesn't have focus
[00:38:18] <RiZKiT> ah, the blur is from our code, just ignore it
[00:38:30] <Cork> RiZKiT: the top section is a plugin
[00:38:39] <Cork> you don't need to declare it like that
[00:38:42] <RiZKiT> cork: i know
[00:38:56] <Cork> so, what "format" are you talking about?
[00:39:10] <dziegler> I really like what Cork did there, but RiZKiT you have a parser that throw source code away that dos not match to a "guid line" ?
[00:39:32] <RiZKiT> moment pls
[00:41:06] <RiZKiT> for you who are curious (too lazy to use a shortlinker): https://help.optimizely.com/hc/en-us/articles/200040335-How-Optimizely-Works-Snippet-order-of-operations-JavaScript-evaluation-timing-and-cookies?flash_digest=74db63481210d28636fda9c777bb655a37b44c3c#evaluate_js
[00:41:40] <Cork> ugg
[00:41:57] <Cork> RiZKiT: and no way to load plugin code ahead of this?
[00:42:06] <Cork> how do you handle things like jquery ui then?
[00:42:14] <RiZKiT> the interesting part is in the infografik (1)
[00:42:45] <Cork> ya i got that
[00:42:50] <RiZKiT> Cork: never had to, yet
[00:43:06] <Cork> but if you can't load plugins you basically can't use anything except core jquery
[00:43:15] <Cork> even effect libraries wouldn't work
[00:43:30] <Cork> so it would have to support loading plugins
[00:43:34] <Cork> and that is what this would be
[00:43:48] <Cork> and then you would fall into the quick code path
[00:44:18] <dziegler> RiZKiT: what is the big advantage, why you are using this?
[00:44:38] <Cork> prob to delay usage of code not known to be fast
[00:44:54] <RiZKiT> well, we use it, and i had to deal with it, and i deal with it the best, so i have to do the jobs =)
[00:45:16] <iamjimmy> Hi, recently I have been working with jquery and webservices in asp.net using c#.I am trying to build commenting system.In that I am receiving data from mssql using webservices and sending it back to ajax call.Ajax call using post request.Problem is I want to align those comments.I am receiving whole comments from the database in the format id,name,comment.Can I align the response using jquery?
[00:45:38] <Cork> iamjimmy: split backstory from question
[00:45:58] <iamjimmy> Cork: sorry I did not get that
[00:46:12] <Cork> iamjimmy: 8 lines of text isn't fun scanning for the question
[00:46:13] <RiZKiT> align? you mean you want to format the data?
[00:46:28] <Cork> so ask the question separately
[00:46:31] <Cork> not in a novel
[00:46:44] <iamjimmy> RiZKiT: yes, exactly
[00:46:53] <iamjimmy> Cork: alright, sorry, I will do that next time
[00:47:25] <RiZKiT> iamjimmy: there are several ways to do this, what kind of format do you like, table?
[00:47:30] <iamjimmy> how can I align data that I just appended in div using $("div").html(data)
[00:47:53] <RiZKiT> iamjimmy: by not appending it this way ;-)
[00:47:55] <dziegler> iamjimmy: may be im wrong, but json should solv the problem because you can wirte/parse it with javascript and c#
[00:47:57] <iamjimmy> something like this <p>id</p> <p> comment</p> <p>name</p>
[00:48:26] <RiZKiT> sound like a task for the ultra cool new project CSS
[00:48:39] <Cork> ah
[00:48:56] <Cork> iamjimmy: simplest is to use white-space: pre
[00:49:06] <Cork> and pad the text before you append it
[00:49:08] <iamjimmy> dziegler: so I should request jason back ?
[00:49:32] <iamjimmy> but I am getting all the comments from db at the same time.Is there a way to read it line by line ?
[00:49:52] <Cork> iamjimmy: not if you get it as html no
[00:50:07] <Cork> well you could traverse the html and modify it
[00:50:34] <dziegler> iamjimmy: your ajax request get HTML as response?
[00:50:43] <Cork> iamjimmy: if you could create an example it would make answering this easier
[00:50:45] <RiZKiT> do you want it this way? http://jsfiddle.net/yEez8/
[00:50:50] <iamjimmy> but for that I need to have tags on the page
[00:51:12] <iamjimmy> wait let me paste the code and everything
[01:11:27] <iamjimmy> sorry I had lost connection
[01:11:32] <iamjimmy> I did not get any of your replies
[01:12:00] <Cork> there hasn't been a comment after you're last line
[01:12:12] <iamjimmy> you did not get the links I sent ?
[01:12:34] <Cork> <iamjimmy> wait let me paste the code and everything
[01:12:39] <Cork> last comment in here
[01:13:07] <iamjimmy> Here is my webservice function : https://ideone.com/FeODdr   and comment format I am trying to create : http://jsfiddle.net/Ln0Lff2x/
[01:13:39] <Cork> iamjimmy: way, way to many global variables
[01:14:10] <Cork> everything except a in the fiddle is a global variable
[01:14:48] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/Ln0Lff2x/1/
[01:15:10] <Cork> $p.css('align', 'right'); <-- this isn't a css property
[01:15:24] <Cork> (correct name is text-align)
[01:15:31] <iamjimmy> Cork: yeah, messed up a little
[01:15:49] <iamjimmy> but I was just showing the syntax of what I am trying to achieve
[01:16:22] <iamjimmy> the problem I am facing is how to format and put all the comments I am receiving in the same reponse
[01:16:26] <Cork> also, you should keep the css in the css file
[01:16:27] <Cork> not in js
[01:17:05] <iamjimmy> I am sending back list of comments
[01:17:10] <Cork> and comment_r will be invalid as you allow multiple ones
[01:17:19] <effortDee> morning everyone, i have made a slidetoggle with some refinements and it works like a charm, but when i click on a refinement, ajax loads the new products and then my jquery slidetoggle slider dies, any ideas? Can't re-refine if you get me? Just a block of closed divs.
[01:18:05] <iamjimmy> the format is: first comment-> reply button-> comments Second comment->reply button->comments
[01:18:20] <iamjimmy> I will deal with reply button latter
[01:18:54] <iamjimmy> but for now I am having trouble in putting all the comments in respective tags
[01:19:07] <neanderslob> hi all, I'm trying to print an array of arrays (2d array for all intents and purposes) to my console log but can't get anything out of it
[01:19:14] <neanderslob> my code is here: https://gist.github.com/BigMcLargeHuge/7e79d923ed7bf101a1f1
[01:19:29] <neanderslob> if anyone's up for having a look, I'd appreciate it
[01:21:09] <Cork> iamjimmy: is this close to what you want? http://jsfiddle.net/Ln0Lff2x/3/
[01:21:57] <Cork> if you want to have it left aligned, but align with the right side of the label, you would have to change the structure
[01:22:57] <iamjimmy> Cork: yes
[01:23:32] <iamjimmy> but problem is retrieving comments
[01:23:40] <iamjimmy> I need to make it json I guess
[01:24:08] <Cork> iamjimmy: give the comment a class
[01:24:39] <Cork> and do $.map($('.comments'), function(elm) { return $(elm).text() });
[01:26:32] <iamjimmy> Cork: but should it be in JSON ?
[01:26:50] <Cork> iamjimmy: depends on how much data you expect
[01:27:00] <Cork> params encoded arrays takes a lot of space
[01:27:08] <Cork> so it might make sense to use json
[01:31:10] <prohobo> neanderslob: the code looks fine
[01:31:16] <prohobo> problem is probably somewhere else
[01:31:43] <neanderslob> prohobo: hey thanks; starting to get that feeling myself
[01:32:25] <neanderslob> prohobo: would it be an issue if I used custom index values for the nested array?
[01:32:52] <prohobo> http://jsfiddle.net/ydd2zkfq/
[01:33:03] <prohobo> i dont know
[01:33:19] <neanderslob> prohobo: alright, I'll play around with it; thanks for the fiddle!
[01:33:51] <iamjimmy> Cork:so I need webservices to return json now
[01:34:00] <iamjimmy> not string -.-
[01:35:20] <Cork> neanderslob: why not just use console.dir?
[01:35:54] <neanderslob> Cork: don't know about it
[01:36:35] <Cork> neanderslob: http://jsfiddle.net/p6cu9zgd/
[01:36:36] <neanderslob> Cork: should I be able to find it within firebug?
[01:36:51] <neanderslob> Cork: oh! I see what you mean
[01:37:49] <Cork> or just console.log and clicking the []
[01:37:59] <Cork> (same display)
[01:39:31] <effortDee> morning everyone, i have made a slidetoggle with some refinements and it works like a charm, but when i click on a refinement, ajax loads the new products and then my jquery slidetoggle slider dies, any ideas? Can't re-refine if you get me? Just a block of closed divs.
[01:39:48] <effortDee> that wont re-open when i click
[01:40:07] <Cork> effortDee: you most likely replace the element containing the slider so you would have to set it up again
[01:41:56] <effortDee> doesnt look like it
[01:43:02] <Cork> ?paste
[01:43:02] <b-ot> Cork: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[01:43:31] <tiCeR> Hey guy :) brillan that this channel is here. someone here that can help me with a little problem ?
[01:43:42] <Xatenev> tiCeR: ask
[01:43:44] <Cork> ?ask @ tiCeR
[01:43:44] <b-ot> tiCeR: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[01:45:06] <tiCeR> So i have a Element that is .clone().insertAfter. Now i have a fuction with .blur(function().... . The Problem is that this function just focus the elements that are not cloned.
[01:46:02] <effortDee> http://jsfiddle.net/s7ykb1ec/ is the jquery im using
[01:47:34] <Cork> effortDee: jQuery('h3.collateheading').on('click' <--
[01:47:43] <Cork> this means it only works for elements that exist as the page loads
[01:47:51] <Cork> you want to delegate the handler to a static parent
[01:49:53] <effortDee> ah right
[01:50:02] <effortDee> that kinda and also doesn't make sense, but thanks for your input!
[01:50:13] <effortDee> do you get paid sitting in here answering everyone as you're always here helping out
[01:50:14] <effortDee> ha :)
[01:50:25] <Cork> effortDee: $() searches the dom and creates an array of all the found elements
[01:50:37] <Cork> .on then loops that array and adds event handlers for the event (click)
[01:50:43] <Cork> that is all that line does
[01:51:01] <Cork> if you later add more elements that would have matched the selector doesn't matter
[01:51:06] <Cork> as that selector won't run again
[01:51:17] <Cork> effortDee: if you instead use a delegated event handler
[01:51:36] <Cork> you select the static parent and bind an event handler that checks for bubbling events
[01:51:48] <Cork> so it catches all event matching the selector
[01:51:55] <Cork> even if it didn't exist at binding time
[01:52:03] <Cork> cause the selector is ran on each event bubbling
[01:52:12] <effortDee> ahhh
[01:52:15] <effortDee> bingo!
[01:52:18] <Cork> (and it is more efficient so double win)
[01:52:19] <effortDee> mucho gracias Cork
[01:52:22] <effortDee> yes
[01:52:42] <effortDee> once again, thanks for your time, i'll be back (in a few months) :p with another problem :D
[02:08:35] <tiCeR> So i crated a fiddle for my problem :)
[02:08:38] <tiCeR> http://jsfiddle.net/#&togetherjs=I4GohH7fAn
[02:08:48] <tiCeR> So i have a Element that is .clone().insertAfter. Now i have a fuction with .blur(function().... . The Problem is that this function just focus the elements that are not cloned.
[02:10:26] <Cork> tiCeR: you need to hit save
[02:10:41] <tiCeR> did
[02:10:42] <tiCeR> :)
[02:10:48] <Cork> then paste the updated url
[02:11:21] <tiCeR> http://jsfiddle.net/pkbg66bk/#&togetherjs=I4GohH7fAn
[02:11:23] <tiCeR> like that ?
[02:11:38] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/pkbg66bk/ ya
[02:11:54] <tiCeR> okay :)
[02:12:19] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/pkbg66bk/1/
[02:16:01] <tiCeR> Cork are you Wild Wolf?
[02:16:05] <Cork> no
[02:16:08] <tiCeR> my code is gone after join
[02:16:11] <tiCeR> :(
[02:16:39] <Cork> after join?
[02:16:39] <tiCeR> okay i am back to it so will wait for someone to join
[02:16:41] <tiCeR> :)
[02:16:56] <tiCeR> there was a person that opened a new fiddle that i should join but nothing has happen there
[02:17:04] <tiCeR> fiddle is new for me so was shocked :)
[02:17:11] <Cork> tiCeR: the /1/ has the fix for your question
[02:17:56] <tiCeR> Coool :)
[02:18:08] <tiCeR> thank you to the person that did it :)
[02:18:14] <tiCeR> how could you see that there was /1/
[02:18:27] <Mark_2> hello.
[02:18:28] <Mark_2> what kind of smartphone do you guys use? iphone or galaxy ?
[02:18:45] <Cork> tiCeR: ... cause i pasted the link?
[02:18:57] <Cork> Mark_2: nexus
[02:19:05] <tiCeR> So i will try to understand that page :)
[02:19:05] <Cork> isn't an option? :P
[02:19:08] <tiCeR> thank you for your help
[02:19:13] <Mark_2> nexus sucks!
[02:19:16] <Mark_2> which nexus?
[02:19:18] <Mark_2> LG nexus?
[02:19:20] <Cork> lol
[02:22:03] <Uhkis> :D
[02:22:40] <Uhkis> maybe Mark_2 is trying to say that non samsung or apple smartphones arent smart
[02:22:56] <Mark_2> i didn’t say that?
[02:23:13] <Mark_2> i just wanted to know what kind of smartphone people use.
[02:23:28] <Mark_2> samsung copies apple so blatantly now.
[02:23:34] <Uhkis> :D
[02:23:35] <Mark_2> and apple’s isn’t all that great either.
[02:23:39] <Mark_2> so.
[02:23:47] <Mark_2> but seriously nexus is not the answer.
[02:50:55] <DRSK> ;(function( $ ) { stuff }); <-- is that document ready or window load?
[02:51:08] <DRSK> I'd like to assume the former but I got confused just now
[02:59:22] <Cork> DRSK: neither
[03:00:01] <DRSK> Cork » the former one up there is in the footer of the page, would that mean it is on document ready? o.O
[03:00:03] <Cork> ;(function($) {})(jQuery); == function something($) {} something(jQuery)
[03:00:45] <Cork> DRSK: it means it runs when the parser gets to the footer of the page
[03:00:56] <Cork> and that is similar to ready, but not exactly
[03:40:37] <DRSK> Cork » sorry for the late reply, the reason I was asking was.. when inspecting a web I made, monitoring the network I can see how much of the page is being loaded in bytes. If I do a clean reload it's say 2.4mb and with cache it's say.. 500 Kb or whatnot. I figured I might be able to set a variable to 2.4 and then check with XMLhttprequest for response and progress towards 2.4, and if it's from cache and the response is 4? I'm done!
[03:42:20] <DRSK> Not sure if at all possible, but then I'd .remove( '.loading' ) based on that, so if it loads from cache and is complete rather fast, simply remove. If not, display a progress and use the progress from the request to fill a percentage? Again though I'm not even sure this is possible ;p
[03:51:12] <MOUD> Hey all
[03:53:57] <MOUD> I have 6 drop down menus. I want to make the second menu based on the selection of the first one, the third based on the second and so on. I'm using MySQL to populate the lists. How can I make it work?
[03:54:35] <Cork> MOUD: you would have to either store the options locally or make an ajax call to the server top get the new options
[03:55:24] <MOUD> Cork: I see. But the values show in the URL? I want to use POST instead of GET.
[03:55:45] <Cork> MOUD: ajax doesn't show in the url unless you want it to
[03:55:56] <Cork> (you have to explicitly update the url)
[03:56:55] <MOUD> Cork: ok. I'll do some googling on that. thanks
[04:09:51] <callumacrae> I'm calling .trigger('click') on an element, and the listener is $(document).on('click', 'theselector'.., but it isn't working
[04:10:02] <callumacrae> it works if I manually click it, but if I trigger a click event, it doesn't work
[04:10:04] <callumacrae> Any idea why?
[04:17:01] <callumacrae> seems to be because data attributes http://jsfiddle.net/ktesr992/
[04:19:28] <callumacrae> or because wrong word, one of the two .-.
[04:21:53] <callumacrae> weird, it works fine in jsfiddle, just not locally
[04:24:10] <callumacrae> oh!
[04:24:14] <callumacrae> there's two instances of jquery
[04:24:18] <callumacrae> right, sorry for the spam

[05:37:32] <MaxSan_> $('h4:contains("Total Goals - Under/Over 0.5"), 'h4:contains("Total Goals - U/O 0.5")')
[05:37:45] <MaxSan_> whats wrong with that multiple selector?
[05:38:06] <MaxSan_> if I delete either or it will select a correct element but not with both listed
[05:39:09] <Clorith> MaxSan_: The comma denotes that the 1st selector is found as a child of the 2nd one
[05:39:14] <Clorith> (in simple terms)
[05:39:31] <MaxSan_> oh ok... how can i make it select if either exists
[05:39:48] <MaxSan_> there will only ever be one or the other, never both
[05:40:06] <MaxSan_> but I never know which
[05:40:19] <Clorith> Have you tried removing the quote before the 2nd h4 ?
[05:40:32] <Clorith> (because that looks invalid as it stands)
[05:40:38] <VectorX> hi, got an issue with this page and safari browser, if you gover a number below the image, you see a tooltip, if you click on and hold still (ie not move the mouse) and after going to next page go back the tooltip is still present, how do you make it go away http://crime-iq.com/about#toggle-id-1
[05:40:51] <MaxSan_> right so
[05:41:29] <MaxSan_> sorry i tried to rewrite it here it may be me rewriting it thats wrong as was removing escape chars from it lol
[05:41:57] <Clorith> Could you show the unfiltered one ?
[05:42:40] <Cork> MaxSan_: you should only use :contains as a last resource
[05:42:53] <Cork> if possible set a class or id on the element you want instead
[05:42:59] <MaxSan_> Il try rewrite it in console and get a good example in a sec
[05:43:02] <Cork> its much faster and stabler
[05:43:16] <MaxSan_> Cork: it is not. Its very difficult to work with these objects
[05:43:32] <MaxSan_> all IDs and classes are generated
[05:43:53] <Cork> i would recommend using .filter(function() {}) instead
[05:44:01] <Cork> you have better control of what your working with then
[05:44:14] <Cork> but ya, an example would help
[05:46:14] <Kiria> reUp my question -> I’m working with the « Resizable Widget » and I can’t set the option « grid » in percentage. Is that possible ? (eg.: grid: ($(this).parent().width()/6), )
[05:46:42] <Cork> Kiria: that would depend on the widget
[05:47:03] <Cork> so can't be answered generically
[05:47:05] <Kiria> on Resizable Widget
[05:47:12] <Kiria> with the option grid
[05:47:14] <MaxSan_> $('h4:contains("Total Goals - Under/Over 2.5")','h4:contains("Total Goals - U/O 2.5")')
[05:47:23] <Kiria> http://api.jqueryui.com/resizable/#option-grid
[05:47:27] <MaxSan_> That when I delete the second one, is correct
[05:47:41] <MaxSan_> but when I have both it doesnt select either
[05:48:22] <Cork> MaxSan_: $('h4').filter(':contains("Total Goals - Under/Over 2.5"), :contains("Total Goals - U/O 2.5")')
[05:48:38] <Cork> though i would prob do it with a function instead
[05:50:03] <Cork> $('h4').filter(function() { return $.inArray($(this).text(), ['Total Goals - Under/Over 2.5', 'Total Goals - U/O 2.5']) > -1 })
[05:50:33] <Cork> MaxSan_: selectors should be one string
[05:51:06] <Cork> your separating them into two strings so you search 'h4:contains("Total Goals - U/O 2.5")' as html for an element matching 'h4:contains("Total Goals - Under/Over 2.5")'
[05:51:08] <Cork> so nothing matches
[05:51:32] <MaxSan_> You sir a scholar and a gentleman
[05:51:45] <Cork> but like i said i would use the $.inArray solution instead
[05:52:10] <Cork> could define the array outside the loop for cleaner code
[05:52:17] <Cork> or should :)
[05:52:47] <MaxSan_> Il see if it will work. We are actually passing the selectors as strings into a evaluated page to use so its a bit odd
[05:53:50] <Kiria> I can not find any information about it in google. This is why I’m here
[05:54:33] <Cork> ?g Resizable Widget documentation
[05:54:34] <b-ot> Cork: Resizable Widget | jQuery UI API Documentation → http://api.jqueryui.com/resizable/
[05:54:42] <Kiria> yep
[05:54:52] <Kiria> but no information about percentage
[05:55:01] <Cork> "Snaps the resizing element to a grid, every x and y pixels. Array values: [ x, y ]."
[05:55:07] <Cork> so that's a "no"
[05:55:25] <Kiria> is there a way to avoid that « no » ?
[05:55:48] <Cork> extending resizable to support none pixel values
[05:56:27] <Kiria> i have a 100% width container as parent
[05:57:10] <Kiria> this is why i need a grid of parent / 6 (bootstrap/2)
[05:57:27] <Cork> the widget doesn't look like it works with percent at all http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/2421
[05:58:47] <Kiria> I’ve seen it but the answer of scott gonzalez dont give the solution ?
[05:59:17] <Cork> the bug isn't closed so ya no solution
[05:59:23] <Kiria> ok ok
[05:59:31] <Kiria> thx for your time
[05:59:37] <Cork> np
[06:00:20] <Kiria> I will found a way less ressources frendly
[06:03:44] <notchris> Hello all
[06:04:13] <Kiria> my solution is -> $('.ui-resizable-handle').bind('click', function(){
[06:04:14] <Kiria> 				var myGrid = ($(this).parent().width()/6);
[06:04:15] <Kiria> 			});
[06:04:25] <Kiria> and a variable on the option « grid »
[06:05:08] <notchris> I’m loading a facebook feed with the JS SDK, on almost every browser it loads, but on some computers it will not
[06:05:22] <notchris> I’ve tested multiple computers with Chrome, multiple OSs
[06:05:26] <notchris> I cant find the cause
[06:06:56] <Cork> notchris: and how is this related to jquery?
[06:09:58] <notchris> Cork: I use jquery Tmpl to create individual posts
[06:10:08] <notchris> However I just found out the culprit is Chrome
[06:10:09] <notchris> Failed to load resource: net::ERR_INSECURE_RESPONSE
[06:10:18] <notchris> Error only shows up on Chrome > Windows
[06:10:27] <notchris> But it’s frome Facebook, so wtf, that’s a certificate issue
[06:14:41] <LucaS05> hi. anyone using select2 jquery plugin? because i initialize it, but if i click on the select it doesn't show the dropdown
[06:15:33] <LucaS05> and if i do: $(".js-example-basic-single").data("select2") i get undefined
[06:16:04] <Cork> sounds like the plugin isn't loaded yet
[06:16:14] <Cork> could you try reproducing it in jsfiddle.net?
[06:16:57] <LucaS05> it's loaded, in fact if i do $(".myelement").select2() in the console, it works fine, and .myelement is initialized
[06:17:12] <Cork> ?paste
[06:17:12] <b-ot> Cork: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[06:17:53] <LucaS05> i want to add that the js code is embedded in a php partial
[06:29:33] <cjohnson> that's irrelevant. the browser doesn't see any PHP
[06:29:58] <cjohnson> if you view the page source, by right clicking and going to view source, that's the only code that the browser cares about
[06:31:09] <VectorX> hi, got an issue with this page and safari browser, if you hover a number below the image, you see a tooltip, if you click on and hold still (ie not move the mouse) and after going to next page go back the tooltip is still present, how do you make it go away as it works fine in other browsers http://crime-iq.com/about#toggle-id-1
[06:32:50] <VectorX> js for reference is here http://jsfiddle.net/n0q2k0fv/
[06:46:33] <K4T> hi
[06:47:45] <K4T> can you recommend lightweight ligtbox plugin to show only one image (no gallery option needed)? It must have loading spinner and be responsive
[06:48:10] <cjohnson> my friend google can
[06:48:21] <K4T> I googled :)
[06:48:40] <K4T> but I am looking for recomendations
[06:48:47] <cjohnson> keep googling. what did you look for?
[06:49:11] <K4T> for example I found: https://github.com/noelboss/featherlight
[06:49:27] <K4T> but it doesnt feed my needs, bad RWD ;/
[06:49:37] <K4T> fit*
[06:50:08] <K4T> I dont have time to test all of thos lightbox plugins, that is why I am looking for recomendations
[06:56:47] <cjohnson> I don't have time to do your homework for you, that is why I am suggesting you do it yourself :P
[07:00:46] <mbrzuzy> K4T, how about fancybox?
[07:01:07] <mbrzuzy> if you google around i'm sure you'll find tons of different libraries for modals
[07:02:15] <K4T> I am looking this right now: http://osvaldas.info/image-lightbox-responsive-touch-friendly looks promising
[07:02:17] <K4T> fancybox is old
[07:02:27] <K4T> and not so lightweight as far as I know
[07:25:22] <mbrzuzy> K4T, if lightweight is important then in the time you've spent looking for a lightbox, you could have written a lightweight and responsive one yourself lol
[07:25:35] <mbrzuzy> Fancybox is old but it works fine
[07:27:26] <K4T> even on mobiles? :)
[07:47:21] <fabio_> can i search instead of value, an array ?   $.inArray('value', $array);
[07:47:47] <IamTrying> This is for Safari and IE browsers lol: http://i.imgur.com/B1qgPRX.png
[07:51:39] <frabblerock> Hey guys, I'm using shuffle to filter categories of events and for some reason, i can't get it working to allow multiple events to be active, it's only sorting through one category at a time.
[07:51:43] <frabblerock> below is a jsfiddle
[07:51:46] <Xatenev> IamTrying: nsfw
[07:51:47] <frabblerock> http://jsbin.com/tohibu/2/
[07:51:47] <Xatenev> :p
[07:52:02] <frabblerock> any pointers?
[07:52:23] <notchris> I’m trying to do: $('.dropdown-toggle').hover(function(){ $('.dropdown-menu').not(this).hide(); });
[07:52:25] <psykrsna> Hello all, I have a problem here - https://dpaste.de/q50j#L13
[07:52:40] <notchris> But “this” references the menu item, not the dropdown menu
[07:52:41] <psykrsna> I want to access a variable in the success function of an ajax call.
[07:52:58] <psykrsna> How do I extend the scope of variable to be available inside that function?
[07:53:16] <mooncup> psykrsna: after the line var data
[07:53:24] <mooncup> you can use var that = $(this)
[07:53:36] <mooncup> then you can do that.bla()
[07:53:59] <psykrsna> mooncup, thanks. that sounds so simple. lemme try it.
[08:07:42] <frabblerock> anyone?
[08:08:12] <Omar-> !ask @ frabblerock
[08:08:12] <b-ot> frabblerock: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[08:08:20] <frabblerock> hahahaha
[08:08:23] <frabblerock> Omar - scroll up
[08:08:27] <frabblerock> you people.
[08:08:31] <psykrsna> How do I get the html of a particular child (without using #id)?
[08:08:40] <Omar-> frabblerock i was sleeping, you woke me up
[08:08:40] <psykrsna> The only identifying thing I have is the class.
[08:08:57] <IamTrying> Xatenev: became sick trying to explain my clients here is the version 2: http://i.imgur.com/QLqsgTL.jpg
[08:08:58] <Omar-> psykrsna class of the parent?
[08:09:00] <psykrsna> var name_column = $form.children('.user_info').html(); Not working
[08:09:10] <frabblerock> Hey guys, I'm using shuffle to filter categories of events and for some reason, i can't get it working to allow multiple events to be active, it's only sorting through one category at a time.
[08:09:11] <frabblerock> [10:51:43]  <frabblerock>	below is a jsfiddle
[08:09:11] <frabblerock> [10:51:46]  <frabblerock>	http://jsbin.com/tohibu/2/
[08:09:24] <psykrsna> Omar, I have the parent object.
[08:09:31] <Omar-> $form.find(.user-info").html()
[08:10:06] <psykrsna> Omar, doesn't work.
[08:10:15] <Omar-> frabblerock let me check although it looks complicated
[08:10:39] <Omar-> psykrsna then in $form there's no .user-info
[08:11:07] <psykrsna> Omar, sorry it worked.
[08:11:13] <Omar-> psykrsna console.log( $form.find(".user-info").length ); if it returns 0, then there's no child with such a class
[08:11:18] <psykrsna> Thanks!
[08:11:23] * Omar- slaps psykrsna around a bit with a large trout
[08:11:30] <Omar-> welcome ;)
[08:15:07] <Omar-> frabblerock i'm still going through the code to understand it
[08:15:11] <Omar-> be patient
[08:15:17] <frabblerock> no problem
[08:15:22] <frabblerock> let me know if i can help at all
[08:15:35] <Omar-> take a seat, we have free drinks here :P
[08:15:39] <Omar-> sure
[08:16:59] <frabblerock> basically, I just want it to show events for any category that has a class of active
[08:25:37] <Omar-> frabblerock you want to setupFilters() on "change" of checkbox and clicking categories below?
[08:29:57] <frabblerock> Omar, ideally - I know it should be set up on change of checkbox, but I couldn't get that working, eventually, the categories below are subcategories and will also have checkboxes
[08:30:30] <frabblerock> I'd rather not worry about them at this point though, and just figure out how to get it to show all categories clicked, instead of one at a time.
[08:31:27] <frabblerock> Omar-
[08:31:54] <robertmaxrees> frabblerock wasn't the issue last night that you were using the wrong data attribute name?
[08:32:07] <frabblerock> this is a different issue.
[08:32:20] <frabblerock> That issue was getting events to show at all.
[08:32:27] <robertmaxrees> ah, i thought that's what the change vs click was all about.
[08:32:30] <frabblerock> This issue is getting more than one category of events to show
[08:34:39] <robertmaxrees> looks like you'll have to grab a list of all selected categories and send over a function i'm guessing
[08:37:18] <robertmaxrees> yeah - http://vestride.github.io/Shuffle/#advanced-filters
[08:39:20] <frabblerock> hmm, I've looked at that and see how it pertains to the search. But is only searching filtered elements, and not concealed ones
[08:40:01] <robertmaxrees> have you gotten a chance to set up a fiddle for others to work with?
[08:41:05] <Omar-> robertmaxrees http://jsbin.com/tohibu/2/edit?html,js
[08:41:25] <robertmaxrees> ballin'
[08:41:35] <Omar-> frabblerock I'm sorry, I'm unable to get what you want to achieve exactly
[08:42:12] <frabblerock> Thats okay Omar, I know its dealing with a library, so it makes it more complicated
[08:42:20] <Omar-> for example, if you choose "Family" it shows 14 items
[08:42:56] <Omar-> what's next step? or expected behavior?
[08:43:08] <Omar-> frabblerock it's okay, let's think loudly
[08:43:38] <frabblerock> okay, lets say i have family selected
[08:44:03] <frabblerock> and i also want to select screenings
[08:44:16] <frabblerock> it should show events for family and for screenings
[08:44:51] <robertmaxrees> yeah, you want to do additive filters.
[08:44:53] <Omar-> good, 2 items are visible
[08:45:20] <robertmaxrees> or did you want all items that are for family OR all items for screenings?
[08:45:32] <robertmaxrees> there's a subtle distinction
[08:48:15] <frabblerock> Sorry omar, I want all items for family AND screenings, IF family and screenings is selected
[08:48:21] <frabblerock> omar-
[08:48:39] <robertmaxrees> frabblerock so you want all items that are both for family and screenings.  think of a venn diagram.
[08:48:48] <frabblerock> no
[08:48:52] <frabblerock> not both for
[08:49:04] <frabblerock> i think were overcomplicating it
[08:49:04] <robertmaxrees> then you want ones that are family OR screenings?
[08:49:19] <robertmaxrees> you need to be specific - i think that's where people are getting confused.
[08:49:27] <frabblerock> if in the categories i have the family checkbox selected AND the screenings checkbox selected
[08:49:44] <frabblerock> it should then show ALL events that have a category of EITHER family OR screenings.
[08:49:49] <robertmaxrees> right.
[08:49:56] <Omar-> frabblerock so in total 16 items
[08:49:59] <frabblerock> yes
[08:50:20] <frabblerock> thank you for your help by the way, i appreciate it
[08:50:23] <Omar-> that's 50% of the solution
[08:50:37] <robertmaxrees> sounds like a custom function that collects all the selected categories and tests each tile to see if it's one OR the other category
[08:50:42] <Omar-> it's a pleasure
[08:59:09] <frabblerock> omar- were you able to come up with anything
[08:59:56] <robertmaxrees> err...
[09:00:20] <Omar-> frabblerock i'm playing around
[09:00:51] <Omar-> as robertmaxrees said, you need to collect "concealed" elements and filter them again
[09:01:37] <frabblerock> omar- im trying to figure out how they do it here
[09:01:38] <frabblerock> http://vestride.github.io/Shuffle/adaptive/
[09:01:50] <frabblerock> but when i try it, it breaks the search
[09:01:56] <robertmaxrees> the docs tell you how to pass a custom filtering function.  get all the selected categories into an array and pass over a filtering function that tests if the current thing's category is in the array
[09:03:35] <fabio_> how do i iterate trought an array with angular?
[09:03:52] <fabio_> ups, wrong channel
[09:04:00] <robertmaxrees> frabblerock Omar- check itemPassesFilters and initFilters on that sample page.
[09:06:39] <robertmaxrees> that first function does almost exactly what i'm suggesting.
[09:09:02] <Omar-> couldn't find them here http://vestride.github.io/Shuffle/
[09:09:09] <robertmaxrees> not there.
[09:09:32] <robertmaxrees> http://vestride.github.io/Shuffle/js/demos/gallery.js
[09:09:32] <robertmaxrees> here
[09:25:02] <basichash> What's the best way of manaing state for a filter (e.g. filter by country, state)?
[09:25:25] <robertmaxrees> basichash totally depends.
[09:25:36] <basichash> I've written about ~150 LOC all as functions, but it's not working like it should
[09:25:46] <robertmaxrees> show us :)
[09:25:53] <basichash> feel like blowing my brains out
[09:25:57] <basichash> one sec
[09:27:01] <pilgrimish> anyone privy to why i might be getting 403 forbidden errors for vimeo videos on mobile http://www.beaconnected.com/ng_site/
[09:30:15] <kokut> Hello, how can i replace the contents of a <span>?
[09:30:22] <robertmaxrees> kokut use .text()
[09:31:11] <basichash> robertmaxrees: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/5ffcdea6e2b0d6703526
[09:32:26] <robertmaxrees> basichash errr, okay.  so what in this code isn't working as expected?
[09:32:57] <kokut> robertmaxrees: thanks, it works :) and how can i get the contents of the selected <option></option> inside a <div class="list">
[09:33:28] <robertmaxrees> kokut you'll have to .find() the selected one by value.
[09:33:55] <robertmaxrees> basichash also, you're doing a lot of [0] when you could just use basic jquery methods instead.
[09:34:49] <basichash> robertmaxrees: so using $.ajax i get get a list of states depending on country
[09:35:14] <basichash> the strange thing is sometimes i can access $("#dynamic-state :selected")[0].value and other times i can't
[09:35:34] <basichash> e.g. when i call updateMap, i can access the value
[09:36:01] <basichash> however when i try to access it out of that function, it's just ""
[09:36:07] <robertmaxrees> basichash race conditions.
[09:36:15] <robertmaxrees> the rest of the code doesn't wait for the ajax call to fire.
[09:36:24] <robertmaxrees> anything that relies on it needs to be in that success callback.
[09:36:29] <basichash> robertmaxrees: ah
[09:36:40] <robertmaxrees> it's asynchronous :)
[09:36:57] <kokut> robertmaxrees: how can i find it by value? I have it on change, so it should be $('#id').selected.innerhtml or something like that?
[09:37:24] <robertmaxrees> kokut http://stackoverflow.com/questions/196684/jquery-get-specific-option-tag-text
[09:37:28] <robertmaxrees> plenty of google reuslts on it.
[09:37:59] <basichash> robertmaxrees: but i'm not calling it in a $.ajax method, so shouldn't that not be an issue?
[09:38:38] <robertmaxrees> basichash is $("#dynamic-state :selected")[0].value  set within that ajax call?
[09:39:20] <robertmaxrees> and btw use .val() instead of [0].value
[09:39:34] <basichash> er i'm really not sure. i don't fully understand javascript's inheritance model, it's confusing
[09:39:45] <robertmaxrees> this has nothing to do with inheritance.
[09:39:54] <basichash> or scoping
[09:40:04] <robertmaxrees> this doesn't have to do with scoping either.
[09:40:28] <basichash> apparently in general
[09:41:03] <robertmaxrees> first of all, var state_variable_pointer = $("#dynamic-state :selected")[0].value; won't update when you select new things.
[09:41:09] <robertmaxrees> that'll just be whatever it is on pageload.
[09:41:37] <basichash> robertmaxrees: ah
[09:42:10] <basichash> is there an easier way than having to keep writing $("#somereallylongcsspath")?
[09:42:21] <basichash> e.g. assigning it to a variable?
[09:42:25] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[09:42:38] <robertmaxrees> var $aSelect = $('#someSelect');
[09:42:50] <robertmaxrees> then in a change event listener you can grab the value by doing $aSelect.val();
[09:42:57] <robertmaxrees> don't over abbreviate things though.
[09:43:00] <robertmaxrees> keep your names clear.
[09:43:23] <nswx> hello, is there any popular jquery based tool which would make the zoom-in, zoom-out effect in header image like in http://cssslider.com/ ?
[09:45:24] <mezod> when using jqueryui.sortable with multiple lists, the receive function only works when an item is dragged between lists. Which is the recommended way to approach when a task is dropped somewhere else in the same list? Using drop only when receive is not fired?
[09:45:54] <basichash> robertmaxrees: sweet thanks
[09:45:54] <DeltaHeavy> I want to animate my accordion menu with CSS3 transitions. The min/max-height hack isn't going to cut it and there has to be a better way than cloning and measuring it...Any help is much appreciated!
[09:46:32] <basichash> robertmaxrees: do you have any tips on how i should lay out the logic? it's difinitely an improvement over what it was before, but it doesn't feel elegant
[09:51:20] <robertmaxrees> basichash modularize things more.
[09:51:28] <robertmaxrees> compose short functions to do what you want.
[09:51:40] <robertmaxrees> you had a bunch of unused variables kicking around.
[09:54:07] <pilgrimish> anyone privy to why i might be getting 403 forbidden errors for vimeo videos on mobile http://www.beaconnected.com/ng_site/
[09:55:21] <basichash> robertmaxrees: righto sounds good. should i use $country, $state, etc to keep track of those variables?
[09:55:23] <robertmaxrees> pilgrimish you'll probably have more luck asking that elsewhere
[09:55:30] <robertmaxrees> basichash sure.
[09:58:25] <hashpuppy> i want to create a new <li><a>text</a></li>.  how can i do that w/ jquery.  $("<li><a>").text("text") seems to result in <li>text</li> and not <li><a>text</a></li>?
[09:59:17] <basichash> robertmaxrees: man thanks for the advice, spent ages on this
[10:00:04] <robertmaxrees> fsho.
[10:00:31] <robertmaxrees> hashpuppy you want $('<li>').append('<a>').text('some text');
[10:00:45] <robertmaxrees> or $('<li><a></a></li>');
[10:01:10] <robertmaxrees> thgough i can't remember if append returns the appended element or the thing you appended to.
[10:01:29] <hashpuppy> yeah, it didn't seem to work
[10:02:38] <robertmaxrees> then create the <a> first, set its text, and append that to the li
[10:03:52] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/skcm4wa3/ like this.
[10:04:03] <Cork> what about $('<a>').text('some text').wrap('<li>') ?
[10:04:12] <robertmaxrees> you could do that, too.
[10:04:52] <Cork> $('<li>').append('<a>').text('some text') <-- this is in the wrong order as it replaces <a> with the text
[10:05:35] <robertmaxrees> yeah, realized append() doesn't return what i thought it does.
[10:06:08] <Cork> ya done that one my self a few times :)
[10:09:40] <kokut> How do you clear the value inside <span id="span"></span> ?
[10:09:50] <robertmaxrees> .text('');
[10:09:50] <Cork> .text('')
[10:09:56] <Cork> :)
[10:10:08] <robertmaxrees> !g jquery empty span text
[10:10:10] <b-ot> robertmaxrees: .empty() | jQuery API Documentation → http://api.jquery.com/empty/
[10:10:16] <Cork> ?api empty
[10:10:16] <b-ot> Cork: .empty(): Remove all child nodes of the set of matched elements from the DOM. http://api.jquery.com/empty/
[10:10:21] <Cork> is an option
[10:10:36] <kokut> how do you clear the text inside <span id="sp">text</span> ?
[10:10:45] <Cork> O_o
[10:10:45] <robertmaxrees> kokut we just showed you how.
[10:10:51] <Cork> twice
[10:10:51] <robertmaxrees> use .text(''); or .empty()
[10:14:46] <kokut> k it works nice, thanks robertmaxrees
[10:18:33] <semiac> I need help submitting a form using jquery.submit() - it goes to the right page, but doesn't seem to be posting .. can somebody help me?  code is here:  http://pastebin.com/mZPuLLhC
[10:20:05] <robertmaxrees> semiac what are you expecting to happen?
[10:20:39] <semiac> well, i'm expecting the form $("#payment-form-send") to post to /shoppingcart/postpay_callback
[10:20:53] <semiac> and it seems to go there, but it doesn't pass the values of the form as a post
[10:20:58] <robertmaxrees> because this code is kind of unusual.  where are you calling that function?
[10:21:10] <semiac> oh, sorry, you're right, there's a part missing
[10:21:18] <robertmaxrees> setup a fiddle if you could.
[10:22:31] <semiac> i can try, i just tried to bring in the relevant code though because it's just too much .. there's a click event handler that calls stripeResponseHandler as a callback
[10:24:42] <semiac> here's the updated pastebin .. i'll try a jsfiddle too http://pastebin.com/sjwkNn2q
[10:25:44] <basichash> robertmaxrees: just a question, when i've created a $("#button").on('click', functionAjaxCall) but after i click it $state becomes ""
[10:25:59] <basichash> robertmaxrees: before that $state is accessible though
[10:26:06] <robertmaxrees> "accessible"?
[10:26:30] <robertmaxrees> what is $state supposed to be?
[10:26:42] <basichash> the name of a US state
[10:27:05] <robertmaxrees> is is a jquery object, a string...?
[10:27:14] <robertmaxrees> (could you share up your code again?)
[10:27:42] <basichash> robertmaxrees: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/5ffcdea6e2b0d6703526
[10:27:55] <mezod> when using jqueryui.sortable. Is there any way to distinguish when the stop event was triggered from the same sortable list or another sortable list?
[10:27:56] <robertmaxrees> i'm not seeing a $state variable.
[10:29:31] <basichash> robertmaxrees: woops wrong one, https://gist.github.com/anonymous/dd74e682b830cbf9ad4f
[10:30:28] <robertmaxrees> $("#dynamic-state :selected").val();
[10:30:37] <robertmaxrees> instead of that [0].value
[10:31:04] <robertmaxrees> is #dynamic-state a dropdown?
[10:31:32] <basichash> robertmaxrees: yeah a semantic ui dropdown
[10:31:47] <robertmaxrees> i don't know what the markup looks like for those.
[10:31:59] <robertmaxrees> you probably want the .val() of #dynamic-state, not of the selected item.
[10:32:34] <robertmaxrees> honestly you shouldn't be shoving variables up into the global scope like you are anyway - just call for the data when you need it.
[10:32:41] <basichash> robertmaxrees: .val() returns the same thing unfortunately, for some reason the way i've structured my code means that the SUI dropdown isn't saving state properly
[10:32:42] <robertmaxrees> instead of setting some global vars via a function.
[10:32:45] <mezod> is there any channel to aska bout jqueryUI?
[10:32:52] <robertmaxrees> mezod that's this channel.
[10:33:13] <robertmaxrees> basichash do  $("#dynamic-state").val();
[10:33:22] <basichash> it prints out "all"
[10:33:29] <mezod> that's bad news then :/
[10:33:39] <robertmaxrees> mezod huh?
[10:33:52] <robertmaxrees> basichash i'd need to see a functioning fiddle at this point - something isn't adding up here.
[10:33:55] <mezod> noone seems to know here :p
[10:34:04] <robertmaxrees> mezod do you have a fiddle of your problem?
[10:34:07] * Velveeta hands robertmaxrees a functioning fiddle... made of gold.
[10:34:17] <robertmaxrees> yusssss
[10:34:19] <robertmaxrees> my favorite
[10:36:18] <mezod> robertmaxrees: it's not a specific problem, it is basically that I use the receive function to track items that have been ddragged between multiple connected lists. But if I drag to the same list receive doesn't work, and using 'stop' is problematic because it is triggered also independently of if the item is dropped in the same list or into another one
[10:39:01] <robertmaxrees> lol that sounds pretty specific.
[10:39:39] <robertmaxrees> you want to do linked sortables and have receive work when you drop something back into the current list?
[10:40:47] <mezod> that would be the perfect solution, but I understand that's not how it works
[10:41:43] <mezod> but if I use "stop" for the case of dropping back to the same list, then in the other cases I get both receive and stop triggered
[10:42:36] <mezod> is there anyway to know inside the "stop" function if the item was already in the same list? ui.sender seems to be null always for stop
[10:43:04] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jqueryui.com/sortable/#event-stop
[10:44:03] <robertmaxrees> sender isn't set if you're not moving from one sortable to another.
[10:44:28] <mezod> yep, then how can I know if the item was already in that list?
[10:44:43] <robertmaxrees> check the stop event and see if ui.sender is null.
[10:44:58] <robertmaxrees> if it is, it's probably from the same list i guess.
[10:45:24] <mezod> nope, unfortunately it's always null for stop
[10:45:34] <robertmaxrees> sounds like you have soimething wrong then.
[10:45:58] <mezod> have read in SO this is the normal behaviour for stop
[10:46:12] <robertmaxrees> for it to ALWAYS be null?
[10:46:42] <mezod> and someone in this channel told me yesterday that the jqueryui api is not very consistent, that I should be surprised if stop shouldn't have a sender at all
[10:46:51] <mezod> yeah makes no sense to me too...
[10:46:59] <robertmaxrees> something is way off here.
[10:47:07] <mezod> but I am not doing anything special really
[10:47:11] <|PiP|> how can i set default parameters for an ajax call?
[10:47:32] <|PiP|> actually, how can i set default parameters that get added to any additional parameters that are added
[10:48:38] <semiac> robertmaxrees:  so, with my form not seeming to post, here's my fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/kc1depzt/
[10:49:59] <mezod> robertmaxrees: see for yourself in this fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/39ZvN/939/
[10:50:57] <robertmaxrees> http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/8842
[10:50:58] <robertmaxrees> it's a bug.
[10:51:55] <robertmaxrees> hrm.  interesting.  it sounds like you'd need to track start and stop events.
[10:56:14] <arthurvr> Hi craig!
[10:56:41] <craig> hi
[10:56:56] <arthurvr> You’ve got a question right? This is the place to ask!
[10:57:33] <arthurvr> craig: fyi #jquery-content is for development chat. Here we do support.
[10:58:13] <craig> ok. i am working on my problem. it may be something other than what i was askig
[10:58:16] <craig> asking...
[10:58:19] <rubyonrailed> $('.override').on('click', function(e) {})  Can I user the || operator with jquery to do something like this: $('.override || .other-class).on('click', function() {})
[10:58:38] <robertmaxrees> rubyonrailed you probably want a comma, not ||
[10:58:47] <arthurvr> rubyonrailed: no. Use comma if you mean ‘and’
[10:59:08] <rubyonrailed> arthurvr would comma work for 'or'
[10:59:31] <arthurvr> rubyonrailed: Nah, not this way. What exactly would you like that thing to do?
[10:59:49] <arthurvr> Do you mean like ‘if this thing exists, use it, if not, use that’?
[11:00:18] <rubyonrailed> Like if '.override' is clicked run the function, or if '.something-else' is clicked run the function
[11:00:26] <robertmaxrees> yeah, use a comma.
[11:00:33] <robertmaxrees> like in CSS.
[11:00:33] <rubyonrailed> Cool
[11:00:37] <rubyonrailed> Thanks
[11:00:50] <arthurvr> rubyonrailed: So you willing to bind an event handler to 2 elements. Use comma :-)
[11:01:48] <rubyonrailed> Cool
[11:02:51] <Omar-> frabblerock
[11:02:59] <frabblerock> hey there!
[11:04:05] <frabblerock> whats up Omar-
[11:28:57] <mezod> robertmaxrees: yep, that's kinda bad...it is a very typical use case
[11:36:33] <jshriver> Anyone have a recommended simple way to do an ajax call in jquery to execute a specific function in php and get the json responce?
[11:36:44] <jshriver> I've tried so many examples my head is spinning..
[11:37:18] <arthurvr> jshriver: $.post to a php page, execute the stuff you need in the php script, return json from there.
[11:37:32] <jshriver> but what if you want to call a specific function in that php script?
[11:37:51] <jshriver> I dont want to have to create a .php file for every single function
[11:38:01] <arthurvr> jshriver: oh that way.
[11:39:22] <arthurvr> jshriver: not a php pro, but can’t this help? http://php.net/manual/en/functions.variable-functions.php
[11:39:37] <jshriver> thanks
[11:39:39] <arthurvr> jshriver: then you could just a get param to receive the function name
[11:39:46] <jshriver> it's not so much the PHP but I know very little JS or jquery
[11:40:02] <jshriver> basically every example assumes the php you are calling does a simple things and returns data.
[11:40:11] <jshriver> no concept of calling a specific method.
[11:42:37] <jshriver> oh well
[11:42:56] <jshriver> this should be a common thing
[11:43:00] <robertmaxrees> it is.
[11:43:05] <jshriver> target.php?method=functionName
[11:43:08] <jshriver> like getStocks
[11:43:10] <jshriver> or whatever
[11:43:17] <robertmaxrees> that should be trivial in php.
[11:43:22] <jshriver> it is
[11:43:25] <arthurvr> yup :-)
[11:43:30] <jshriver> but I dont understand how to do it from a ajax/jquery
[11:43:39] <rubyonrailed> When i console.log(this) inside my function, this returns : <div class="override"> <a href="#">Grant</a></div> : How do I grab the class name from the "this" variable
[11:43:41] <jshriver> to make an ajax call and get the response
[11:43:42] <robertmaxrees> set the url to then call that URL.
[11:43:48] <rubyonrailed> this.class doesn't seem to work
[11:44:10] <jshriver> but I get javascript errors saying invalid method.
[11:44:21] <robertmaxrees> jshriver you put it in the string.
[11:44:22] <jshriver> almost like it's treating "target.php?method=derp"  as a file name
[11:44:23] <robertmaxrees> for the URL.
[11:44:33] <arthurvr> rubyonrailed: $(this).attr(‘class’)
[11:44:43] <arthurvr> `api attr @ rubyonrailed
[11:44:43] <b-ot> rubyonrailed: .attr(): Get the value of an attribute for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/attr/
[11:44:51] <robertmaxrees> or this.classList
[11:44:57] <rubyonrailed> Thanks
[11:45:09] <robertmaxrees> jshriver show us your code maybe?
[11:45:10] <arthurvr> Sure you can use classlist too.
[11:45:40] <arthurvr> rubyonrailed: but be aware of IE9+
[11:45:46] <robertmaxrees> ^ yeah
[11:45:54] <robertmaxrees> .prop() would be safer overall.
[11:46:00] <hlvwrk> http://pastebin.com/TUa92dGq is my syntax in my variable correct
[11:46:02] <hlvwrk> :|
[11:46:04] <rubyonrailed> arthurvr what will happen in IE?
[11:46:24] <arthurvr> rubyonrailed: an error will get thrown
[11:46:34] <arthurvr> rubyonrailed: cuz classlist doesn’t exist in there.
[11:46:44] <arthurvr> rubyonrailed: http://html5please.com/#classlist
[11:46:46] <cjohnson> fyi rubyonrailed the DOM attribute is called "className". But I would use a helper as suggested above
[11:46:57] <rubyonrailed> Alright, but .attr() is safe to use?
[11:47:02] <cjohnson> prop
[11:47:07] <arthurvr> rubyonrailed: prop actually
[11:47:07] <rubyonrailed> prop
[11:47:08] <robertmaxrees> jquery attr or prop, yeah.
[11:47:15] <robertmaxrees> $(this).prop('class')
[11:47:15] <rubyonrailed> Awesome, thanks.
[11:47:31] <cjohnson> I wonder why it's called className. Just because IE reserved "class" for a time?
[11:47:36] <GingerGeek> does the .trigger() method wait for all event handlers to complete before continuing?
[11:48:00] <arthurvr> cjohnson: class is just a reserved keyword
[11:48:12] <arthurvr> cjohnson: https://mathiasbynens.be/notes/reserved-keywords
[11:48:17] <cjohnson> GingerGeek: I believe trigger happens synchronously but that isn't to say the handler bodies couldn't continue doing something asynchronously
[11:48:26] <GingerGeek> that's fine :)
[11:49:04] <cjohnson> http://jsfiddle.net/v6pm20jn/
[11:49:35] <cjohnson> with 2 handlers: http://jsfiddle.net/v6pm20jn/1/
[11:49:55] <cjohnson> arthurvr: guess that makes sense. thanks
[11:50:03] <arthurvr> cjohnson: lol :-)
[11:50:52] <Gmac_> is there a reaosn why insertBefore is just making the elements im targeting dissapear?
[11:51:12] <cjohnson> paste your code? are you inserting a node that already exists elsewhere on the page?
[11:51:18] <Gmac_> i have a aside element with h3's and p's
[11:51:21] <cjohnson> you could have the args backward
[11:51:26] <Gmac_> i want to split each h3 into a new aside
[11:51:38] <GingerGeek> Thanks cjohnson, I checked by causing it to sleep for a bit as well :D http://jsfiddle.net/v6pm20jn/2/
[11:51:58] <Gmac_> so i was trying jQuery('aside h3').insertBefore("</aside><aside class='lesson-sidebar'>");
[11:52:35] <cjohnson> GingerGeek: actually you don't even need to do that. async code in javascript is _guaranteed_ to not run until at least the next tick
[11:52:47] <cjohnson> in my example, if the handler were triggered asynchronously, the output would be 1, 2, Foo
[11:53:07] <cjohnson> even if the async returned in 0.00001ms
[11:53:21] <cjohnson> but good to check!
[11:53:27] <GingerGeek> Right that's it
[11:53:31] <GingerGeek> I'm calling magic
[11:53:39] <GingerGeek> :P
[11:56:46] <cjohnson> setTimeout(foo, 0) is an example for how to call a method asynchronously without any delay, and you can see here it doesn't run until teh current block completes: http://jsfiddle.net/xr9khgbL/1/
[12:01:11] <cjohnson> Gmac_: http://jsfiddle.net/wdy4mthm/
[12:04:18] <Gmac_> thanks
[12:04:27] <Gmac_> almost wokred. the 2 top h3 are together
[12:06:28] <Gmac_> and they are in reverse order
[12:09:46] <cjohnson> Gmac_: ?
[12:09:54] <Gmac_> i got it wokring
[12:10:01] <Gmac_> your was reverse order
[12:10:16] <Gmac_> i tried container.find('h3 ~ h3').insertAfter(container).wrap('<aside>');
[12:10:19] <Gmac_> im wokring on it
[12:11:07] <cjohnson> reverse order? all I did was take the first h3 (which is what h3:first means) and moved it into its own aside to show you how to accomplish what you want
[12:11:10] <Gmac_> problem is there is also p tags in the way
[12:11:26] <Gmac_> well they came out reverse order
[12:11:27] <Gmac_> 3 2 1
[12:11:31] <Gmac_> lookat yuor code
[12:11:54] <cjohnson> it's not reverse order
[12:12:04] <cjohnson> it's taking the first h3 from the aside and moving it into a new aside
[12:12:06] <cjohnson> look at the output
[12:12:20] <cjohnson> the order is 2 3 1 and the "1" has its own aside
[12:12:30] <Gmac_> well why is it reordered?
[12:12:40] <cjohnson> look at the output.
[12:13:01] <cjohnson> I took the first h3 from the aside and I moved it into a new aside
[12:13:09] <Gmac_> ok. so its taking the first one and appending after
[12:13:13] <cjohnson> if you want the new aside to be above the other one, not below it, change it to insertBefore
[12:13:19] <Gmac_> but what if i have tons of paragrahps in between each h3
[12:13:29] <Gmac_> i just wanted to close the first aside and start a new one by each h3
[12:13:46] <Gmac_> aside>h3+p aside>h3+p
[12:13:58] <cjohnson> you'll have to build a selector that selects all the elements until the next h3 then to include with your h3
[12:14:04] <cjohnson> and do it in a loop
[12:14:42] <cjohnson> ideally, your h3+paragraph combos would already have a <div> around them
[12:14:46] <cjohnson> since they are semantically linked
[12:14:53] <cjohnson> and you could just split out aside div
[12:17:29] <Kamuela> I'm trying to figure out how to query a selector within a class that randomly generates its ID according to google_map_*
[12:17:50] <Kamuela> I know searching the whole page for it would be bad, so I'm trying to select it by choosing child of the nearest static div and then return anything matching that regex
[12:19:09] <Kamuela> class that wraps it is map-wrapper, so i'm trying to formulate something like $('.map-wrapper').child('#google_map_*'), what would be the proper way to do this?
[12:21:26] <hagabaka> Kamuela: https://api.jquery.com/filter/#filter-function
[12:23:59] <hagabaka> Kamuela: witha function like like function(index, element) {return $(element).attr('class') =~ /\bgoogle_map_/;}
[12:24:29] <Kamuela> hagabaka: is index something that can specify the map-wrapper?
[12:25:32] <hagabaka> Kamuela: no, that's the function you pass it to $('.map-wrapper'). The index argument is just the index of the element you're currently checking
[12:26:25] <hagabaka> *that's the fucntion you pass to $('.map-wrapper').filter, so $('.map-wrapper').filter( function(index, element) {return $(element).attr('class') =~ /\bgoogle_map_/;} )
[12:30:30] <Kamuela> hagabaka: does that regex expression need to be in quotes?
[12:30:49] <hagabaka> Kamuela: no, in slashes
[12:31:57] <Kamuela> hagabaka: so if i'm getting undefined is not a function, it's because it's not finding it in the children then?
[12:32:17] <_DB> if I use   $.each( data.beacon[0]['advertisings'], function( key, value ) {     but data.beacon[0]['advertisings'] doesnt exist will I get a error?
[12:33:00] <gnarf> _DB: yes
[12:33:13] <_DB> a length error ? XD
[12:33:15] <gnarf> yes
[12:33:22] <_DB> because thats what im getting was wondering if it was from it
[12:33:25] <_DB> ok thanks
[12:33:33] <gnarf> a $.each(undefined, function() {}) in your console will answer that for you :)
[12:35:20] <_DB> what type of if should I add before running the each then?
[12:35:35] <_DB> if data.beacon[0]['advertisings'].length >0 ?
[12:35:40] <_DB> or some sort of isset
[12:35:45] <hagabaka> Kamuela: you'll need to debug for yourself, for example enter $('.map-wrapper') in console, then enter $('.map-wrapper').filter(function(index, element) {console.log($(element)}), etc
[12:35:48] <gnarf> if (data.beacon[0]['advertisings'])
[12:35:59] <_DB> alright no doubt thanks bud
[12:36:03] <gnarf> undefined is falsy, so is empty array
[12:36:11] <gnarf> but anything else you would probably pass there is truthy
[12:36:19] <gnarf> but like
[12:36:25] <gnarf> if data.beacon[0] doesn't exist
[12:36:28] <gnarf> thats still a problem
[12:36:43] <_DB> no it exists just the advertisings part doesnt at times
[12:36:59] <Kamuela> hagabaka: map.wrapper works and returns as one of its contained id="google_map_qzd", hmm
[12:37:09] <Kamuela> map-wrapper**
[12:38:00] <gnarf> hagabaka: where are you getting =~ from? :)
[12:38:43] <hagabaka> oh, sorry about that
[12:38:44] <Kamuela> hagabaka: this ended up working jQuery('.map-wrapper').children('[id*="google_map_"]').show()
[12:39:18] <gnarf> Kamuela: ^= matches only begining
[12:39:30] <gnarf> do you want .find instead of .children
[12:39:32] <gnarf> ?
[12:42:54] <Kamuela> gnarf: what would be the benefit?
[12:43:24] <Kamuela> it seems like children traverses only down where find traverses everywhere, i was ok with children if it saved compute time
[12:45:43] <Kamuela> also the whole map function seems to be completely requerying google for the map data, i'm hoping adding jQuery(this).trigger('click'); to the bottom of its own routines does what I wanted. basically i want it to be open on page load
[12:46:02] <Kamuela> just opening the div didnt' trigger the rest of the redraw
[12:53:35] <Kamuela> is document.ready loaded synchronously or async?
[12:56:55] <Cork> Kamuela: events are sync
[12:57:39] <Cork> Kamuela: but it partly depends on where the ready function is called from
[12:58:06] <Cork> so the question as you asked it can't be completely answered
[12:58:45] <Cork> Kamuela: if you mean a variable set inside .ready can be accessed directly after (outside)
[12:58:50] <Cork> then generally, no
[12:59:06] <Cork> if you call it late enough, then... yes :)
[13:09:55] <Kamuela> Cork: thanks :), it does work as the last script on the page lol
[13:10:45] <Cork> Kamuela: ya, cause by then jquery sees the dom as loaded and just executes the script passed to it
[13:11:41] <Cork> Kamuela: but if there is something you need outside of ready, it is normally best to set it straight
[13:11:55] <Cork> and of code depends on the dom getting loaded it should always be inside
[13:12:14] <Kamuela> Cork: i loaded it within a document.ready as the last script on the page which is why i was wondering what kind of behavior to expect
[13:23:08] <Cork> Kamuela: you can expect each .ready block to be called in the order they are loaded in the page
[13:23:42] <Cork> and that is guaranteed, how it runs in relation to code outside is more complex though
[14:20:16] <_DB> anyone here familiar with r-studio?
[14:28:11] <mezod> anyone who has implemented multiple sortable lists with jqueryui.sortable?
[14:31:51] <stylica> hi, this is rather sizzle question, but this is so used intensively together with jquery and also it is much more popular (in combination).
[14:32:11] <stylica> So I want to select all elements on a page that not bear some specific css property.
[14:32:19] <stylica> Can I do this? How is performance affected?
[14:34:09] <tandroid> stylica: you can't select based on properties.
[14:34:46] <tandroid> you can do .someElement:not(.someclass) {/*do stuff*/}
[14:36:32] <tandroid> oh.
[14:36:38] <tandroid> I thought i was in #css.
[14:36:45] <tandroid> Damn, long day.
[14:37:33] <tandroid> You still can't select by property with jquery.
[14:38:10] <tandroid> unless it's in a style tag
[14:38:23] <tandroid> I mean style attribute.
[14:48:31] <dn5> how shall I check if there is particulare text in whole page?
[14:50:46] <imfamousirl> how can i detect if a script changes an input value? $('#input_id').change() isn't detecting when a script changes the input value.
[15:11:38] <stylica> tandroid: oh, so I can't check what styles currently apply?
[15:11:58] <tandroid> Not easily.
[15:12:02] <stylica> ok!
[15:12:08] <stylica> tandroid: would be overkill anyway, thanks
[15:15:29] <kostasx> Hi guys! Anyone know of a site or tool that will enable me to search for sites using a specific jquery plugin?
[15:15:35] <dn5> seriously, does anybody know how to check whole body for a string?
[15:17:50] <rubyonrailed> Can i use jquery to change the name of a select tag?
[15:19:17] <kostasx> dn5: $("body:contains('textString')") ??
[15:19:31] <tandroid> eh...
[15:20:10] <tandroid> or maybe $("body").text(); then do a regular expression on that
[15:20:30] <dn5> kostax, I was thinking about that, but now I saw that I have <div class="vjs-error-display"><div>sometext</div></div>, so it would be faster if I could check only this div, but it has no class name
[15:21:20] <tandroid> dn5: $(".vjs-error-display").children().text() ?
[15:21:25] <kostasx> What about its parent? with .vjs-error-display?
[15:21:29] <kostasx> yep
[15:22:35] <dn5> let me try that
[15:26:11] <dn5> that is working fine @ tandroid , didn't know about children()
[15:26:46] <tandroid> great, there are many other ways you could select that.
[15:27:05] <tandroid> one being just $(".classname div"); like you would in css.
[15:27:30] <tandroid> But the way I showed is most efficient.
[15:27:48] <tandroid> you should also look at .find()
[15:28:39] <dn5> tandroid: Thanks man, I'll check it fosho. Is there also an equivalent command to "die()" in PHP? I mean, to clean whole page and break the script? Sorry I'm a backend dev
[15:29:07] <tandroid> You can set breakpoints in your web inspector
[15:29:24] <Omar-> !ping robertmaxrees
[15:29:42] <tandroid> in chrome you can go to the sources tab then find your script and set one in the left gutter.
[15:29:52] <stylica> dn5: yes, use a proper debugger than doing it the php way which usually means cowboy coding with echo and their friends.
[15:30:03] <kostasx> or place a 'debugger' string in your source code.
[15:30:09] <kostasx> debugger;
[15:30:10] <kostasx> like this
[15:30:47] <dn5> I'm not asking this for me, I'm asking for a end-user
[15:31:07] <kostasx> dn5: what are you trying to achieve?
[15:31:25] <kostasx> there is not die() in JS
[15:31:51] <dn5> To clean the page, no output needed. I know, kostasx that there isn't, I wouldn't ask for equivalent. Something like $("body").empty()
[15:33:11] <tandroid> dn5: generally you try to fail gracefully in js.
[15:33:45] <tandroid> I'm sure that's not answering your question though.
[15:33:48] <dn5> tandroid: It's not my fault, it's not my type of language
[15:34:03] <kostasx> why empty() is no good for your case?
[15:35:20] <dn5> kostasx: I'm wondering if there is anything faster
[15:35:42] <kostasx> document.body.innerHTML = "";
[15:35:46] <kostasx> maybe?
[15:36:28] <dn5> kostasx: that! oh god..
[15:36:53] <dn5> I was trying to find pure js logic to do that
[15:37:03] <kostasx> there you go then
[15:37:05] <kostasx> :)
[15:37:54] <dn5> kostasx: thanks man
[15:38:06] <kostasx> ;)
[15:57:59] <bencc1> how can I check that a request is Ajax on the server?
[15:58:22] <bencc1> I'm using "x-requested-with" but Android sends com.android.browser
[15:59:17] <snover> bencc1: what?
[16:00:46] <bencc1> snover: what part of my question wasn't clear? :)
[16:02:00] <snover> bencc1: you are saying that android is overriding the X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest header from jQuery?
[16:02:06] <snover> android browser?
[16:03:15] <bencc1> snover: I'm getting two values for X-Requested-With on my log: com.facebook.katana, com.android.browser
[16:03:36] <bencc1> I'm not sure if it override jquery's header or add it to a normal page load request
[16:03:59] <snover> non-CORS ajax requests through jquery get X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest, so check for that
[16:04:01] <bencc1> my question is if X-Requested-With is a reliable way to detect an ajax request
[16:04:33] <bencc1> snover: com.android.browser won't be added to Ajax requests?
[16:05:14] <bencc1> com.facebook.katana looks like the facebook android app
[16:05:25] <bencc1> and com.android.browser might be the default browser or another webview
[16:06:32] <snover> Android WebKit WebRequest will set X-Requested-With to the package name but will not override another value that was already set
[16:07:15] <bencc1> snover: that explains my bug. I was assuming that isn't set for non-ajax request
[16:07:16] <bencc1> thanks
[16:08:37] <bencc1> snover: is X-Requested-With correct and reliable way to detect Ajax?
[16:08:42] <bencc1> or do I need to use something else?
[16:53:21] <stylica> Can I bubble-selector up from a clicked element (so from this) until I hit an element with a specified class?
[16:59:26] <Dr-007> json return data = [Object { smarty_name="waaa", id="2"}]. the objects name is also `data`. to reach the id i'll have to use data.id right?
[17:00:22] <stylica> ha, I found it, closest() doe what I want.
[17:00:27] <stylica> quite well
[17:05:20] <_eddy> if i do localStorage.setItem("something", data['something']); the first time i get something
[17:05:40] <_eddy> if i do it the second time will this overwrite it with the new data?
[17:06:54] <Dr-007> yes
[17:07:05] <Dr-007> arent you confusing setItem and getItem?
[17:07:22] <Dr-007> because you're saying 'the first time i get something'
[17:10:28] <_eddy> Dr-007: yes sorry i meant getItem
[17:11:15] <Dr-007> ok
[17:11:18] <_eddy> Dr-007: what about when getItem
[17:11:25] <_eddy> using *
[17:11:47] <_eddy> will that overwrite the storage value if the key is the same?
[17:13:00] <Dr-007> i don't know
[17:13:14] <Dr-007> but i dont think getItem should overwrite it
[17:13:26] <Dr-007> see if you havent got any accidental setItem's
[17:19:26] <vinex08> most of the web apps are built via jQuery?
[17:25:11] <_eddy> vinex08: +1

[19:37:17] <iamjimmy> hi, I am using ajax in jqyery.I have got back my json reponse and I parsed it using parseJSON.How to read it word by word ?
[20:00:36] <iamjimmy> is anyone here?
[20:43:29] <ragas> what is wrong with jQuery('.course-entry').each(function(){  console.log(jQuery(this).innerHTML);   });  It returns undefined for each one.  jQuery('.class-entry').innerHTML works fine. also tried messing w
[20:45:57] <ragas> ok, nm
[21:02:29] <Woet> ragas: why .innerHTML instead of .html() ?
[21:05:13] <ragas> i figured that out Woet , thanks.
[21:07:29] <iamjimmy> can someone please help me..
[21:09:20] <VectorX> hi, can som1 tell me why this isnt working http://jsfiddle.net/209L0vh7/2/ ?  when i click a button i need value of the above checkbox to show
[21:23:05] <ragas> jQuery(".course-entry")[0].offsetTop;// 78  jQuery(this).offsetTop....?
[21:24:41] <Uhkis> VectorX: you have a bunch of syntax errors there
[21:27:20] <VectorX> Uhkis i didnt notice, but im trying to find the most generic way to get the input checkbox related to the button, coz the html can change and the input may or may not be in a div
[21:27:57] <VectorX> which is why i used .closest but that seems to check the main elements i guess
[21:36:19] <VectorX> i changed the example a bit for different scenarios http://jsfiddle.net/209L0vh7/4/
[21:37:10] <VectorX> relavent checkbox will always have class="i8-select" and button class="i8-add"
[21:38:03] <Uhkis> pff
[21:38:42] <VectorX> why ?
[21:48:23] <VectorX> Uhkis ok sorted out the syntax errors :)
[21:48:49] <VectorX> http://jsfiddle.net/209L0vh7/5/
[21:49:50] <Uhkis> http://jsfiddle.net/209L0vh7/6/ now there's no errors
[21:50:31] <VectorX> :)
[22:03:38] <VectorX> Uhkis i still cant get the elements, can you help with that
[22:03:52] <VectorX> the original problem i was asking
[22:06:06] <VectorX> so, clicking on the Add button should alert the value of the closest input above it which has class="i8-select" http://jsfiddle.net/209L0vh7/7/
[22:09:46] <Uhkis> you readded the syntax errors
[22:10:10] <Uhkis> and you're going to need some serious code the find the previous checkbox with so random html
[22:13:08] <VectorX> ic
[22:13:38] <Uhkis> or maybe turn it around
[22:19:55] <VectorX> Uhkis i think if i create 3 scenarios one under each and check if there are elements and finnaly add the click event it will work
[22:28:23] <VectorX> Uhkis think i got it http://jsfiddle.net/209L0vh7/8/
[22:30:43] <VectorX> wonder if the code can be made more concise
[22:30:50] <VectorX> or efficent
[22:33:34] <Uhkis> well the input[type=checkbox] is kinda pointless there
[22:36:59] <VectorX> Uhkis i have some other input boxes in the actual code so trying to filter faster
[22:37:55] <Uhkis> how big is your dom O_O
[22:42:43] <Cork> VectorX: to start with use delegated event handlers instead of binding each add button individually
[22:43:03] <VectorX> Cork how do i do that
[22:43:09] <Cork> ?api delegate
[22:43:09] <b-ot> Cork: .delegate(): Attach a handler to one or more events for all elements that match the selector, now or in the future, based on a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[22:43:13] <Cork> read that page ^
[22:43:20] <VectorX> thanks
[22:43:47] <Cork> i would also recommend using more classes
[22:43:56] <Cork> as that is faster then attribute selectors
[22:44:10] <Cork> (if speed really is such a problem)
[22:44:29] <Cork> and define your variables!
[22:45:00] <VectorX> i didnt cuqite get that by 'attribute selectors' do you mean dont use input[type=checkbox]  ?
[22:45:14] <Cork> [] <-- attribute selectors
[22:45:22] <VectorX> ah
[22:45:27] <Cork> meaning the browser has to find the element then search for the attribute
[22:45:31] <Cork> and then check the value
[22:45:35] <VectorX> yeah i guess i can drop it
[22:45:43] <Cork> for each element matching the element selector
[22:46:03] <VectorX> i thought it would be faster
[22:46:07] <Cork> also you're missing what .pref does
[22:46:27] <Cork> line 4-6 does nothing
[22:46:58] <Cork> as .prev only checks the immediate previous sibling
[22:47:04] <Cork> it doesn't search for a matching sibling
[22:47:08] <Cork> ?api prev
[22:47:08] <b-ot> Cork: .prev(): Get the immediately preceding sibling of each element in the set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/prev/
[22:47:43] <VectorX> 4-6 is what seems to be making what3 work
[22:48:28] <VectorX> sorry i mean what4
[22:48:36] <Cork> ah, sorry reading again i see you have a .parent there
[22:48:43] <VectorX> yeah
[22:48:44] * Cork blames the early morning :P)
[22:48:55] * Uhkis hands Cork some coffee
[22:49:09] <VectorX> Cork no issue, i always value your input
[22:53:12] <NikoZz> hi there
[22:53:16] <NikoZz> any suggestions about event handling in js? how should I deal with events for example, "do this" when "that" is over etc?
