[03:27:14] <Success> what's the equivalent of $(element).clone(); without using jquery?
[03:27:56] <Cork> element.cloneNode()
[03:28:44] <Uhkis> yet another character saved by jquery! :D
[03:29:02] <AdamPDotty> oh, they do it one by one now?
[03:29:40] <Cork> .clone() does more then cloneNode() though
[03:29:51] <Cork> especially .clone() handles jquery data
[04:20:37] <donquijote> hello
[04:20:38] <donquijote> having a header that gets a css class on scroll down: http://www.timodannenhauer.de
[04:20:47] <donquijote> when scrolling down it fades in but when scrolling up it just disappears
[04:20:55] <donquijote> how can I get a fade out effect as well?
[04:23:24] <Cork> donquijote: make a jsfiddle with the code your using for the animation
[04:25:58] <AdamPDotty> its a bit complex there
[04:31:56] <donquijote> https://jsfiddle.net/ov20dqdj/
[04:32:50] <Cork> uh...
[04:33:15] <Cork> looks like you should have asked this in ##javascript as this has nothing to do with jquery
[04:34:05] <donquijote> ok I will try there
[04:34:22] <Cork> can't even find any event handlers...
[04:34:29] <Cork> so not sure how that code even works...
[04:34:56] <Cork> oh, there is more >_<
[04:35:58] <Cork> ook so it depends on css translate
[04:36:25] <Cork> the animation looks like it works in both directions for me
[04:36:48] <donquijote> @Cork: also on the website itself?
[04:36:59] <Cork> donquijote: didn't check the website
[04:37:25] <Cork> but as the problem doesn't show in the fiddle you have a lead that the problem comes from something else
[04:37:51] <donquijote> for me it also works in the jsfiddle
[04:39:17] <donquijote> but I'm on Safari on Mac and when scrolling very fast upwards (elastic scrolling) it behaves somehow wrong
[04:39:29] <donquijote> also in the jsfiddle
[04:39:54] <Cork> donquijote: browsers call the scroll event async
[04:40:07] <donquijote> at first it disappears, then for a short time its showed again and then fades out
[04:40:18] <Cork> so ya, you have to make the area "big enough" to not miss if a range is skipped
[04:40:25] <Cork> not much you can do about that
[04:40:51] <donquijote> probably has to do with the 300px specified or?
[04:41:07] <Cork> it changed a while back cause calling scroll on the rendering thread (needed to not make the call async) makes smooth scrolls impossible
[04:41:16] <Cork> donquijote: yes
[04:41:47] <Cork> so now days the browsers call the scroll handle "when it has time"
[04:41:59] <Cork> and just skips it the other times
[04:42:43] <donquijote> so any chance to just get it fade out properly and "restore" the header without the added css class?
[04:43:13] <Cork> the scroll event is the only option currently
[04:43:26] <Cork> csswg is working on css hooks to handle it from there
[04:43:30] <Cork> but it isn't standard yet
[04:43:44] <Cork> (much less implemented in the browsers)
[04:44:03] <Cork> an option is position: sticky;
[04:44:16] <Cork> but it isn't implemented in all browsers (and you get no animations)
[04:44:53] <donquijote> anything else?
[04:44:58] <Cork> nope
[04:45:10] <Cork> those are the two options that exist today
[04:45:59] <donquijote> okay thanks so far!
[06:05:27] <d2k> hello, I wanted to report that I found a solution for "show appended div onclick while adding another class with toggleClass and finally reset everything on click of a child a.k.a. close button". It's now mostly based on CSS and kinda works like a charm. None of the before provided solutions worked, neither 1000 open stackoverflows for research and trying around. However I still have a focusout bug, e.g. when the below div is beeing cl
[06:06:10] <d2k> the rare thing is that the below div should not be clickable at all but be it like that the main issue is that clicking outside should work exactly the same way as the close button
[06:07:11] <d2k> http://dpaste.com/3ED455C   ...this has no outside click function since I could not find one that fitted
[06:08:54] <d2k> line 18 is not needed / not working / would be nice if it could work
[06:30:27] <d2k> now I solved it by making the close btns width and height avoiding any clicking of the below elements
[06:31:07] <d2k> thank you very much for the all the hints, they helped get to the point, solved :)

[07:06:39] <DreamStiffler> thanls
[07:10:10] <DreamStiffler> tapout: are you taplar?
[07:21:46] <Cork> DreamStiffler: there is no closest selector
[07:21:55] <Cork> DreamStiffler: .closest() searches for the closest parent
[07:22:13] <Cork> in your case you need to look for .sibling() or .preAll()

[09:05:56] <z1haze> morning
[09:06:51] <z1haze> i have an issue with a fixed position sticky sidebar overlapping my footer, and need help with a solution: I build a pen to illustrate whats happening: http://codepen.io/z1haze/pen/BzBweJ
[09:30:58] <z1haze> why does this glitch so badly? or what is a better solution? http://codepen.io/z1haze/pen/BzBweJ
[09:33:23] <AwkwardCough> are you wanting it to stop at the top of the footer or go behind it?
[09:35:33] <z1haze> stop
[09:35:47] <z1haze> been messing with this thing for forever now
[09:36:30] <z1haze> our sticky nav kicks in at 77px from top so i just fudged the > 77 to make it fixed, but i dont know how to make it stop at the footer
[09:37:09] <z1haze> need to change its position to absolute but i dont know when
[09:38:00] <lowbro> maybe jquery can detect when two elements are overlapping?
[09:41:20] <Cork> zivester: grab the elements position().top value
[09:41:38] <Cork> and when it goes past the top of the overflow element change it to position: fixed
[09:42:12] <Cork> (fixed is better then absolute cause then you don't have to update the position as it scrolls)
[09:49:06] <z1haze> ive updated here: but still its so inconsisten i dont understand why
[09:49:06] <z1haze> http://codepen.io/z1haze/pen/BzBweJ
[09:53:52] <z1haze> think i got it : http://codepen.io/z1haze/pen/BzBweJ
[09:55:29] <Cork> z1haze: http://codepen.io/z1haze/pen/BzBweJ
[09:55:47] <Cork> z1haze: the problem was that you had top: 77px
[09:55:56] <Cork> also the >= 77 is too big
[09:56:28] <AdamPDotty> also $('.stickything') -> var
[09:56:34] <Cork> ya
[09:56:46] <Cork> also have a look at position: sticky;
[09:56:53] <Cork> it does basically what your trying to do with js here
[09:58:38] <Cork> z1haze: https://jsfiddle.net/uy8uf7dj/1/
[09:59:18] <z1haze> cork this fiddle doesnt do anything?
[09:59:45] <Cork> it does if your browser support position: sticky;
[09:59:56] <z1haze> chrome
[10:00:00] <Cork> ah, ya...
[10:00:08] <z1haze> and this is for a big business, we dont do stuff that might not work on some browsers
[10:00:09] <Cork> https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=231752
[10:00:24] <z1haze> wish we could not care about the few but cant do that
[10:00:37] <Cork> there are poly fills for sticky though
[10:01:02] <Cork> ex. https://github.com/filamentgroup/fixed-sticky
[10:01:32] <Cork> https://github.com/wilddeer/stickyfill is prob better

[10:33:17] <skywater> hi i have an input field, if i put data in that field i need to click with the mouse in that field to update data in another element. Is it also possible to bind my enter key to the field? Now my enter key is binded at the submit button.
[10:36:04] <puff> Good afternoon. I'm trying to use jquery knob ( http://anthonyterrien.com/knob/ ), when I set the data-min to the same value as the default value in the input, it makes the circle start at data-min, i.e. ther's no colored area of the circle at all.  I want the circle to start at zero, with the colored area always being the data-min value.
[10:37:08] <puff> I.e. if I have a range of 0-100, and the existing value at page load is 25 and can never go below 25, there should be quarter-circle of color, which the user can increase to any number higher than 25, but never below 25/quarter circle.
[10:39:10] <puff> Or the existing value could be 50, or whatever, but the minimum is 25, etc.
[10:50:07] <baako> hi guys https://jsfiddle.net/baako/yx95mjxo/ in the form with the id newform i wnat to add a class "has-success" to each of the div with class "control-group"

[11:21:16] <Kingsy> when using jquery tooltip how can I delay the close event after mouseout?
[11:23:21] <baako> Kingsy, $( "#elementid" ).tooltip({show:{delay: 2500}});
[11:23:44] <Kingsy> baako: wont that hide it regardless if I mouseout or not?
[11:25:38] <Kingsy> close:{delay: 2500} <-- doesnt seem to do anything see
[11:25:59] <baako> Kingsy, http://api.jqueryui.com/tooltip/#event-close
[11:26:07] <baako> i think thats what you need
[11:26:26] <baako> delay it on the close
[11:29:36] <Kingsy> baako: hmm what do you mean? can you show me an example?
[11:32:44] <Kingsy> baako: regardless of what you put in that close event its still going to trigger and close the tooltip
[11:32:48] <Kingsy> you cant "delay" it
[11:32:55] <taplar> http://api.jqueryui.com/tooltip/#option-hide <-- look at the Object option, it mentions a delay
[11:34:54] <Kingsy> ahhh there we go. damn. so hide is what I wanted. close was just the event
[11:34:57] <Kingsy> thankyou
[11:35:00] <Kingsy> haha thanks again taplar
[11:35:01] <Kingsy> :P
[11:35:53] <baako> taplar, jquery pro
[11:36:08] <taplar> nah, api searchin pro, ;)
[11:38:48] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/q903977s/
[11:43:40] <baako> taplar, i need your help please. https://jsfiddle.net/baako/07w55tyj/15/ var data is a json i getr back from an api which i then use to display on the html. My app is a one page app so the issue i am having is that when the user clicks on the page which that(see jsfiddle) is shown, the html display doesnt look right and it takes a few seconds for it to look correctly. The issue i think is because jquery/jquery ui havent finish appending the content to
[11:43:40] <baako> the html. My question how do i show like a loading icon and then remove it once jquery/jquery ui have finish manipulation the div
[11:43:51] <baako> or do you have a better suggestion
[11:43:58] <baako> thanks
[11:44:08] <taplar> overlay, :)
[11:44:29] <taplar> paired with either bootstrap or font-awesome spinner
[11:45:30] <taplar> one sec and i'll show an example
[11:47:09] <baako> am using boostrap :)
[11:59:22] <baako> taplar, any luck?
[11:59:34] <taplar> here's the concept: https://jsfiddle.net/xrtysk6n/
[11:59:47] <taplar> it's using fa, but you can  change it to use bootstrap spinner
[12:00:05] <taplar> but essentially you make the overlay fixed position with a z-index over everything
[12:00:21] <taplar> then you hide it when your ready to reveal your page
[12:01:31] <baako> taplar, its not necessary about the delay the question is how long?
[12:01:42] <taplar> huh?
[12:02:05] <baako> i dont know how long / user interest speed
[12:02:23] <baako> getting the data and then jquery manipulation it
[12:02:33] <taplar> you can't really know their net speed
[12:02:41] <taplar> all you can know is when your ajax response returns
[12:03:07] <taplar> you'd want to create your elements, make any styling changes to them, and then add them to the page
[12:04:39] <taplar> aside from images loading and such, when the browser draws elements, it should already have the styling applied to it
[12:08:01] <baako> taplar, i will be back in 40 mins need to pick up the kids
[12:08:26] <taplar> np, i may be at lunch, but more than likely i'll be lurking, :)
[12:48:12] <puff> I could use a little jquery mentoring.
[12:48:19] <robertmaxrees> ask away :)
[12:48:35] <puff> robertmaxrees: thanks.
[12:48:52] <puff> I'm using jquery knob I'm using jquery knob T
[12:48:55] <puff> Dangit.
[12:48:58] <puff> jquery knob, http://anthonyterrien.com/knob/
[12:49:56] <puff> In the "Example" section on that first page, what's happening here? $(function() { $(".dial").knob(); });
[12:50:14] <robertmaxrees> that's a document ready with a call to the jquery knob method
[12:50:22] <puff> I have two inputs of class="dial", both of them become the fun visual knob with that single call.
[12:50:28] <robertmaxrees> learn.jquery.com will give you a full rundown to understand what all of that's doing,
[12:50:41] <puff> I want to add a change event to the dial, but how do I avoid adding it to both?
[12:50:59] <robertmaxrees> a change event handler or the knob?
[12:51:05] <puff> Though, come to think of it, the first dial is readOnly anyway, so I guess I don't have to worry about it.
[12:51:13] <robertmaxrees> you do actually.
[12:51:20] <robertmaxrees> it can still fire the change even handler.
[12:51:40] <puff> When the second knob is adjusted, I want two things to happend, a) if new setting is less than X, reset setting to X, b) update a value displayed below.
[12:51:53] <robertmaxrees> so first of all try making a jsfiddle.
[12:52:58] <puff> Okay.
[12:56:35] <taplar> side note, looks like their is a min setting that could account for a)
[12:57:14] <robertmaxrees> puff https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/eh6puf7f/ this what you have?
[12:57:20] <robertmaxrees> seems to be taking you a while...
[12:59:04] <puff> robertmaxrees: working on it.  https://jsfiddle.net/g8epkoco/
[12:59:08] <puff> But it doesn't work.
[12:59:13] <robertmaxrees> woah
[12:59:19] <puff> I haven't done javascript in forever.
[12:59:56] <robertmaxrees> you have extra /> in there.

[13:01:18] <robertmaxrees> puff also, can't use https://github.com/aterrien/jQuery-Knob/blob/master/js/jquery.knob.js for the js file link.
[13:01:30] <robertmaxrees> that's just a page on github.
[13:01:35] <robertmaxrees> you want something like https://github.com/aterrien/jQuery-Knob/blob/master/js/jquery.knob.js

[13:03:18] <robertmaxrees> puff so you're looking for https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/g8epkoco/6/ ?
[13:03:49] <puff> https://jsfiddle.net/g8epkoco/8/
[13:04:00] <robertmaxrees> okay.  so what's up?
[13:04:08] <puff> Looks neat.
[13:04:14] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[13:04:16] <puff> I reduced the size of my dials to 100 to make this easier.
[13:04:27] <Uhkis> psst, there's a tidy button on the top
[13:04:47] <puff> Uhkis: Jfiddle is neat... but I like my formatting better :-)
[13:04:49] <taplar> loose lips sink ships Uhkis
[13:04:59] <robertmaxrees> puff your formatting is confusing to the rest of us ;)
[13:05:06] <puff> Okay, I'll use tidy.
[13:05:06] <robertmaxrees> should get that in your js and not in data attributes instead :)
[13:05:15] <puff> Oh?
[13:05:19] <puff> Why is one preferable?
[13:05:37] <puff> My code is loaded in a java app, I'm setting some of the default values in those input attributes from a JSP.
[13:05:37] <robertmaxrees> markup is great for presentation.  js is great for logic.
[13:05:50] <Uhkis> taplar: yeah, you better not tell anyone! :D
[13:06:10] <robertmaxrees> either way.
[13:06:12] <taplar> what are we talking about?  *wink wink*
[13:06:40] <Uhkis> taplar: donuts!
[13:06:54] <taplar> mmmm, cake donuts....
[13:07:20] <taplar> dounuts?
[13:07:24] <puff> https://jsfiddle.net/g8epkoco/9/
[13:07:26] <taplar> idk, i'm not a spellar
[13:07:27] <puff> Mmmm, donuts.
[13:08:10] <baako> taplar, am back
[13:08:11] <puff> So in the long run I'm looking to do three things, a) make it so new cannot ever be less than old, b) update the table display below the controls when the value changes, c) superpose new over old (i.e. make old small enough to fit inside new and position them one over the other).
[13:08:23] <taplar> baako: cool
[13:09:01] <puff> Last time I did javascript was for a fake website for a Showtime tv series around 1999/2000.
[13:09:12] <puff> So I'm a little rusty here :-).
[13:09:36] <taplar> which one is new and which one is old?
[13:10:16] <puff> left is old, right is new.  I added labels.
[13:10:33] <taplar> is the old actually for the users, or for your logic?
[13:10:35] <duch_kazatel> sorry, got dc'd
[13:11:00] <robertmaxrees> so what's the question?
[13:11:17] <puff> Okay, so I should move the settings out of the input tags and into the javascript, which brings me back to my question about how do I set up a distinct $("dial").knob call for each control.
[13:11:34] <taplar> class="dial old-dial"
[13:11:39] <taplar> class="dial new-dial"
[13:11:41] <puff> ah, cool.
[13:11:42] <robertmaxrees> give them different classes.
[13:12:25] <puff> Ah, so using ".dial" is arbitrary, not required by jquery knob or anything?  Cool.
[13:12:40] <robertmaxrees> yeah, that's why i pointed you to learn.jquery.com
[13:12:41] <taplar> just a selector to get the elements you want to initiate knob on
[13:12:54] <robertmaxrees> right.
[13:13:17] <robertmaxrees> $('somestring') is how jquery selects things.  .knob() only needs a jquery object to work against.
[13:13:40] <puff> Ah.
[13:13:59] <puff> And then I can put parameters in the .knob({ })
[13:14:04] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[13:14:10] <robertmaxrees> it takes an object.
[13:14:33] <robertmaxrees> you could make an object in the page and then pass that, even.
[13:14:49] <robertmaxrees> .knob(window.someNamespace.firstDialOptions)
[13:14:51] <robertmaxrees> or whatever.
[13:15:26] <eddy> taplar
[13:15:32] <taplar> hi hi
[13:15:40] <puff> Cool.  Stylistically, any of those params *don't* belong in the javascript?
[13:16:09] <puff> I guess input name and input value.
[13:16:17] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[13:16:27] <robertmaxrees> the only things you put in the knob config are things related to knob.
[13:16:44] <puff> Yeah, so all the data-etc.
[13:16:47] <puff> But nothing else.
[13:17:01] <puff> But a lot of those data-etc are presentation stuff.
[13:17:26] <robertmaxrees> they're configs for knob.
[13:17:33] <robertmaxrees> which should be in your js.
[13:17:38] <puff> okay then.
[13:27:18] <puff> Cool, https://jsfiddle.net/g8epkoco/15/
[13:27:28] <puff> okay, so now I just add the change bit.
[13:28:04] <decx> hehe... knob
[13:28:23] <puff> decx: Thank you Beavis.
[13:28:54] <Uhkis> :D
[13:29:13] <taplar> and here i was refraining from making a polish joke
[13:29:25] <decx> was it stolen?
[13:30:05] <puff> robertmaxrees: Thank you.
[13:30:24] <puff> taplar: And thank you.
[13:30:38] <puff> Uhkis: I'm still not sure about the tidy feature, but thank you :-)
[13:30:39] <taplar> nah, i settled for a hob knob joke yesterday
[13:31:03] <puff> I wonder what a hobknobgoblin does.
[13:31:46] <taplar> phss, probably sucks
[13:31:47] <Uhkis> is kookoo for cocoa puffs
[13:32:28] <puff> I guess I should watch out for an infinite loop here... if I have a change function for the knob, and part of what it does is reset the knob input's value to some minimum, that might also invoke the change hook?
[13:33:06] <taplar> if you logically change it I don't believe so
[13:33:15] <puff> Thanks.
[13:33:46] <robertmaxrees> iirc the knob itself has that option right?
[13:33:50] <robertmaxrees> the lib i mean
[13:34:37] <taplar> i still wonder why your letting them even try to go below X
[13:35:06] <robertmaxrees> ^
[13:36:20] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/g8epkoco/17/
[13:36:41] <puff> robertmaxrees: the change or release hook?  Yeah.
[13:37:04] <robertmaxrees> neither.  the knob thinger has a thing to limit the range i thought.
[13:37:11] <puff> taplar: How od I stop them?
[13:37:18] <taplar> ^ see previous link
[13:37:22] <puff> Yeah, but the limit doesn't work right for my purposes.
[13:37:29] <Uhkis> taplar: that looks so wrong with the other one having 15% filled
[13:37:39] <puff> Exactly.
[13:37:42] <taplar> 'min'
[13:37:55] <puff> I want it to start at 15% filled in and stay 15% filled in.
[13:38:03] <puff> Instead, it's starting with 12 o'clock = 15%.
[13:38:04] * taplar shrugs
[13:38:23] <puff> Otherwise the user will get confused.
[13:38:31] <taplar> i'm already confused by this interface
[13:39:35] <taplar> it's like your trying to appeal to race car enthusiasts
[13:40:32] <taplar> is it a space consideration where a slider wouldn't work?
[13:41:23] <puff> Replacing an old flash control that has a dial metaphor.
[13:41:50] <puff> It's actually for bandwidth.
[13:42:02] <puff> CIR vs. PIR.
[13:42:27] <puff> So the "old" is the committed bandwidth, the "new" is the peak bandwidth.
[13:42:39] <taplar> yeah, i've see stuff like this for displaying bandwidth values
[13:42:41] <taplar> but never input
[13:42:48] <taplar> nothing about this to me screams input
[13:42:57] <taplar> but whatevs, :)
[13:55:18] <puff> taplar: Yeah, mine is not to question why, etc. Sigh.
[13:56:26] <robertmaxrees> heh, as a dev it is :)
[13:56:36] <robertmaxrees> i'll never understand places that say you can't.
[13:57:17] <taplar> if it's already like that then it's an issue of consistency with the users
[13:57:26] <puff> Yeah.
[13:57:29] <taplar> but as a new thing, i'd question the hell out of it
[13:57:33] <robertmaxrees> ^^^
[13:57:35] <puff> The old flash app does it that way,etc.
[13:57:41] <robertmaxrees> ugh
[13:57:43] <taplar> cause if I went to a site and saw that, you'd have to tell me what it was
[13:57:50] <taplar> which isn't good ux
[13:58:30] <puff> Yeah.
[14:44:45] <j1j1j1> I'm using JQuery mobile to style a mobile site with forms - A user enters text on page 1, selects attachments on page 2, and submit button goes to page 3 and creates an email with the text and attachments.
[14:45:00] <j1j1j1> Something in JQuery JS is keeping my attachments from attaching
[14:45:38] <j1j1j1> The forms / emails work perfect without JQuery, but including the JS causes attachments not to attach
[14:45:51] <j1j1j1> I ultimately just want the JQuery styling
[14:45:52] <robertmaxrees> oaky.
[14:45:54] <j1j1j1> Any idea?
[14:45:56] <robertmaxrees> *okay
[14:46:14] <robertmaxrees> so jQuery Mobile modifies things in the page, but without seeing it break, it's kind of hard to help.
[14:47:22] <j1j1j1> There's no error messages that I know of, I just know foreach($_FILES) is returning zero files on the final page when JQuery is in use
[14:47:25] <robertmaxrees> the phrase "the js causes attachments not to attach" is ephemeral without context.
[14:47:45] <robertmaxrees> so i assume you have a form that you'r submitting to your backend.
[14:48:04] <robertmaxrees> and there are supposed to be files on it but adding jQuery mobile cases that to no longer?
[14:48:09] <robertmaxrees> *causes
[14:48:09] <j1j1j1> Correct. I can read in the text fields fine with $_POST[]
[14:48:12] <robertmaxrees> can you share any code?
[14:48:20] <robertmaxrees> show us what your frontend looks like.
[14:50:05] <robertmaxrees> a fiddle would be awesome.
[14:50:08] <j1j1j1> http://hastebin.com/anezayufew.xml
[14:50:41] <robertmaxrees> can you give me just raw html without php
[14:50:41] <robertmaxrees> ?
[14:52:00] <j1j1j1> http://hastebin.com/zezavapuja.xml
[14:52:03] <robertmaxrees> also, what version of jquery mobile are you using?
[14:52:05] <robertmaxrees> and jquery
[14:52:36] <robertmaxrees> because using a newer version it should work just fine.
[14:53:14] <j1j1j1> <link rel="stylesheet" href="http://code.jquery.com/mobile/1.4.5/jquery.mobile-1.4.5.min.css" />
[14:53:14] <j1j1j1> <script src="http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.11.1.min.js"></script>
[14:53:14] <j1j1j1> <script src="http://code.jquery.com/mobile/1.4.5/jquery.mobile-1.4.5.min.js"></script>
[14:53:23] <robertmaxrees> yeah, according to https://demos.jquerymobile.com/1.4.5/forms/, that should work fine.
[14:54:02] <j1j1j1> For some reason without the JQuery it works fine but with JQuery it's returning zero files.
[14:54:07] <robertmaxrees> you keep saying that.
[14:54:08] <robertmaxrees> :)
[14:54:27] <robertmaxrees> I'm aware that's the issue but it's hard to know why without seeing the whole thing together.
[14:54:41] <robertmaxrees> i'd check the jQuery Mobile docs for any caveats.
[14:55:09] <robertmaxrees> somebody else may come along and have something else to add though.
[14:56:17] <j1j1j1> Is there any way to use JQuery for styling without all the JS?
[14:56:35] <robertmaxrees> fwiw the j should be lowercase, and the js applies some things that makes the css work.
[14:56:52] <robertmaxrees> and it's jQuery Mobile that you're concerned with, not jQuery :)
[14:57:27] <robertmaxrees> you won't really be able to use just the css since it relies on some bootstrapping that the js makes iirc.
[14:57:32] <robertmaxrees> i could have that wrong though.
[14:59:01] <j1j1j1> I see some work-arounds here I'm going to try: https://forum.jquery.com/topic/jquery-mobile-seems-to-clobber-ability-to-upload-files-via-forms
[14:59:16] <robertmaxrees> for what it's worth that thread is 5 years old.
[14:59:28] <robertmaxrees> wait back waaaay up.
[15:00:29] <robertmaxrees> when you aren't using jquery mobile are you using ajax?
[15:01:10] <robertmaxrees> because if not, that's likely your problem.  just need to turn off ajax.
[15:01:15] <robertmaxrees> *for forms
[15:01:32] <j1j1j1> Nope, not using Ajax
[15:03:55] <j1j1j1> Adding data-ajax="false" to my form tag submitting the files worked. Just had to re-link to the jQuery Mobile css/js on the final page to keep my styling
[15:08:59] <j1j1j1> Thanks for taking a look at my code robertmaxrees
[15:17:04] <puff> Ah joy.
[15:17:26] <puff> project lead just told me there are screenshots of the old flash control on the website, so "a lot of people are going to want input on it".
[15:17:46] <taplar> lol
[15:17:56] <taplar> hope you have some asprin at hand
[15:18:18] <puff> Lots of alcohol.
[15:18:34] <taplar> you shouldn't take alcohol with asprin dude
[15:18:44] <taplar> :P
[15:21:58] <puff> Right, no asprin.
[15:34:55] <momo> Hello i am trying to insert and image Before a div but it doesn't wanna work but if i tried to insert an h1 tag it works
[15:35:14] <momo> so could any one please explain to me why this happining and what i am missing
[15:35:55] <taplar> show us?
[15:36:18] <zZap-X> can jquery do a vertical ticker for text or do i need a plugin for that?
[15:36:19] <momo> this is my code of course that i am using https://jsfiddle.net/fgytsypv/
[15:37:26] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/fgytsypv/1/
[15:37:33] <taplar> ok, so show us the image version that doesn't work
[15:37:43] <momo> okie
[15:39:05] <momo> but what did u do to make this work
[15:39:14] <taplar> i included jquery in the fiddle
[15:39:44] <taplar> the javascript tab in the top right of the bottom left area
[15:43:57] <momo> aww  this is the img https://jsfiddle.net/fgytsypv/
[15:44:04] <momo> and sorry for being late net speed
[15:44:48] <taplar> no image in that link
[15:44:54] <taplar> that's the original link
[15:45:35] <momo> okie so how it will work if i am using a direct link :)
[15:46:00] <taplar> you change the fiddle to show your problem, then click update up top, and the url will change
[15:46:24] <momo> okie
[15:48:13] <momo> https://jsfiddle.net/fgytsypv/2/
[15:48:44] <taplar> open your console
[15:48:56] <momo> okie and ?
[15:48:56] <taplar> also pay attention to the highlighting that jsfiddle is doing to your code
[15:49:14] <momo> Yea
[15:49:19] <taplar> what do you see?
[15:49:27] <momo> I see a big mistake
[15:49:30] <taplar> :)
[15:52:23] <momo> so i add single quote or slashes ? cuz i couldn't solve the wrong highliting problem
[15:52:47] <taplar> i'd use single quotes myself
[15:53:41] <taplar> though if this isn't for just learning i'd question why your doing that
[15:54:19] <momo> Thxx man :) for lighting the things up in my head :D
[15:54:38] <momo> U know little things in your code can drive you crazy :D
[16:21:47] <jilocasin0> afternoon everyone.
[16:23:09] <jilocasin0> I'm trying to use jQuery datatable with DOM based data.  unfortunately it throws a "Requested unknown parameter '0' for row 1." error and thinks it has twice as many rows as it has.
[16:23:16] <jilocasin0> Anyone have any ideas?
[16:25:01] <taplar> can you show what your trying to do in a jsfiddle?
[16:31:34] <jilocasin0> I'm trying, but I have to find the libraries (I have them downloaded and local).
[16:37:24] <decx> https://cdnjs.com/
[16:37:49] <decx> jilocasin0 ^
[16:40:02] <puff> What am I missing here? https://jsfiddle.net/u95yy21n/33/
[16:40:28] <taplar> a " in front of value
[16:41:05] <puff> Yeah, that would certainly do it.
[16:41:19] <puff> It'd be cool if my editor would like, y'know, highlight a bunch of stuff in red when that happens.
[16:41:23] * puff bangs his head agaisnt the keyboard.
[16:41:30] <taplar> jsfiddle did...
[16:41:42] <puff> taplar: Yeah, that was my point.
[16:42:01] <puff> I was trying to figure out what the red was about and still completely missing the ".
[16:42:07] <puff> Thanks.
[16:50:40] <jilocasin0> https://jsfiddle.net/msodwno5/10/ (I've only found 2 .js and 2 css files and it doesn't look like my table (no sortable etc.) and no errors... :( )
[16:52:06] <taplar> does your table have any rowspan or colspan ?
[16:52:12] <jilocasin0> (the app has about 50 js/css files)
[16:52:29] <jilocasin0> no, just a <span> within a single cell.
[16:52:55] <jilocasin0> you can see the actual table in the jsfiddle (see above)
[16:53:10] <taplar> so that html is representative of your table then?
[16:53:22] <jilocasin0> What I am seeing is 5 rows displayed but the table is saying 'Showing rows 1 to 10 of 40 entries.'
[16:53:26] <jilocasin0> yes.
[16:53:41] <jilocasin0> there are only 20 rows.
[16:53:53] <taplar> ah, dunno about that then
[16:54:41] <jilocasin0> 20 rows 7 headers 7 columns, column 0 == image link
[16:55:38] <jilocasin0> it's as if every row is followed by an empty row.
[16:57:49] <jilocasin0> if I sort by a non-image column, I get page 1 & 2 empty (although it says 1 to 10 on page 1 and 11 to 20 on page 2).
[17:02:49] <jilocasin0> jQuery seems to have lost it's mind and can't properly count to 20....
[17:11:41] <acidjazz> screen -dr
[17:11:45] <acidjazz> crap
[17:11:51] <acidjazz> pls everyone thats my root password
[17:11:58] <acidjazz> g ahead and ignore that
[17:14:43] <zzaichik> haha no.
[17:15:00] <zzaichik> at least it isn't password1234
[17:16:54] <taplar> Unbr8k@bl3
[17:16:59] <zzaichik> Or, if you believe the movie Hackers, at least it isn't "god"
[17:29:44] <_3by8> Trying to get a jQuery plugin working with rails. Installed it via Bower and I've included the package in my project. For reference, it's the jquery-validation plugin and it's got an optional file called "additional-methods" that isn't loading with the rest. No idea what I'm doing.
[20:11:08] <Side_FX> Is there something wrong with this?  $("#checkid").on( "click", function() { alert('test');} ?
[20:11:16] <robertBusy> yes
[20:11:20] <robertBusy> missing a closing )'
[20:11:30] <Side_FX> Awww.. Thanks.
[20:42:13] <HowardwLo> whats the difference between .on(‘change’) and .on(‘input’) ?
[20:47:49] <HowardwLo> i’m trying to detect changes in my input elements so i can display a “unsaved changes” warning
[20:48:12] <HowardwLo> but some of my input fields are changed via jquery
[20:48:19] <HowardwLo> not sure if that triggers it
[20:50:56] <sigdk> are jqXHR.success() and jqXHR.error() deprecated ? I'm using 1.10 but done() and fail() don't seem to work
[21:03:44] <shoky> sigdk: yes
[21:03:59] <shoky> done() and fail() should work
[21:04:28] <sigdk> shoky, ok, I think I was using them incorrectly. just tried to replace error and success... but I need to chain them
[23:05:07] <HowardwLo> strange thing, I’m doing .data(‘unsaved’, ‘1’); in console,and I don’t see the data-unsaved value being changed. it also returns “0” which is previous value. however if i use .data(‘unsaved’);, it returns “1”
[23:05:10] <HowardwLo> whats going on?
[23:05:53] <HowardwLo> $('button[data-unsaved="1"]'); returns nothing
[23:05:56] <shoky> .data() doesn't write to the attribute, it can only read from it.  it writes to an internal jquery cache. which you can read with .data()
[23:06:03] <HowardwLo> oh
[23:06:18] <HowardwLo> so to set the value in the dom, i would use .attr ?
[23:06:31] <shoky> to set an attribute you use .attr yes
[23:58:07] <karlosm> hi
