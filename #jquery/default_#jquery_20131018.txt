[00:00:03] <jphase> then use what fl0rian_ said ^
[00:00:17] <dieguezz> well, all at the same time! this is great :P . Let me try guys
[00:00:26] <jphase> well, might be more like $(this).find('ul').slideToggle() or something
[00:00:50] <jphase> er... children not find :x
[00:07:51] <sasmit87> jphase:how to add errorPlacement object of jquery validator to a custom event??
[00:09:02] <jphase> sasmit87: I think that's just a jQuery DOM object so just like $('label.myLabelClass') to place it there
[00:09:24] <LoneSoldier728> http://jsfiddle.net/zg67b/4/ ok so this is the problem if anyone understands it
[00:09:34] <LoneSoldier728> basically in console.log it shows up as [object, object]
[00:09:37] <LoneSoldier728> which is undefined
[00:09:57] <LoneSoldier728> it is similar to ur problem jphase but I shouldnt have to specify [0].title
[00:10:09] <LoneSoldier728> or [0].key1
[00:10:12] <LoneSoldier728> in the example case
[00:10:26] <Cork> LoneSoldier728: wait, what is showing up undefined?
[00:10:43] <sasmit87> but it has a claback function like errorPlacement:function(error,element)
[00:10:45] <LoneSoldier728> when i store xyz in localStorage
[00:10:52] <LoneSoldier728> the value of it is undefined
[00:11:04] <jphase> LoneSoldier728: what's in your node console.log ?
[00:11:56] <LoneSoldier728> [Object, Object]
[00:12:01] <LoneSoldier728> oh in node
[00:12:03] <LoneSoldier728> it shows right
[00:12:16] <Cork> LoneSoldier728: http://jsfiddle.net/zg67b/5/
[00:12:17] <LoneSoldier728> it shows the [{key1: value}]
[00:12:18] <Cork> works for me
[00:12:21] <LoneSoldier728> which is throwing me off
[00:12:48] <LoneSoldier728> ya cork but i cant be doing that
[00:12:56] <Cork> ok?
[00:13:07] <Cork> what are you trying to do then?
[00:13:24] <Cork> are you parsing the string when you get it back?
[00:14:26] <LoneSoldier728> ok
[00:14:33] <LoneSoldier728> it works actually i just realized im using
[00:14:37] <LoneSoldier728> jade somehow wrong
[00:20:15] <jphase> LoneSoldier728: and how are you using it in jade?
[00:20:52] <LoneSoldier728> "#{result}"
[00:21:01] <LoneSoldier728> but it only shows object, object
[00:21:03] <LoneSoldier728> bunch of em
[00:21:39] <jphase> LoneSoldier728: try just #result ?
[00:21:52] <jphase> or do you have to have that?
[00:21:58] <sasmit87> jphase: I added it same way as you told but its showing ass errorplacement is not a function   http://hastebin.com/hehisajafo.coffee
[00:23:26] <jphase> hmm, errorPlacement is an option of validator sasmit87, when you do custom validation on top of it you'll need to just place the error label yourself
[00:23:44] <dieguezz> hi, can somebody help me make this menu dropdown on click ? http://jsfiddle.net/5wbKD/2/
[00:23:44] <jphase> the line above it is more like what you're looking for
[00:25:38] <LoneSoldier728> damn see this works
[00:25:38] <LoneSoldier728> http://jsfiddle.net/qfquC/2/
[00:25:52] <LoneSoldier728> but i am getting the first console.log for sme reason but all the objects like that
[00:27:41] <sasmit87> jphase: line above means the commented line
[00:27:51] <sasmit87> right??
[00:28:02] <jphase> yeah, that's more like what you should be doing
[00:28:39] <jphase> check to see if it's valid, then add the label or change text accordingly
[00:29:01] <sasmit87> ya in that way its working but when you click form submit again it is also validating by default
[00:29:10] <sasmit87> so its adding the label again
[00:29:32] <jphase> sasmit87: just make a fiddle of this and I'll fix it for you, you've been trying to do this for awhile now
[00:29:47] <jphase> oh, right, you need validator
[00:29:48] <jphase> hmm
[00:29:49] <jphase> sec
[00:35:20] <sasmit87> you can see the sreenshot here how its coming two times http://tinypic.com/view.php?pic=2j4akc6&s=5#.UmDkjrP7sYx
[00:36:36] <sasmit87> because first one is my custom validator that is statically I am adding one label and another is form submit validator validation
[00:39:17] <Rohan_Bhangui> sasmit87: thank you for loving ubuntu
[00:39:22] <Rohan_Bhangui> :P
[00:39:43] <sasmit87> what ?? how do you know I love ubuntu
[00:40:42] <sasmit87> jphase : you there ?
[00:41:03] <jphase> yeah, sec
[00:41:14] <sasmit87> ok sure
[00:51:28] <jphase> sasmit87: you need to do something like this http://jsfiddle.net/jphase/HWzgU/1/
[00:51:59] <fugutive221> Hi everyone!
[00:52:05] <sasmit87> ok let me check jphase
[00:53:56] <fugutive221> I've got a problem with toggle (and also fadeToggle) in combination with tables
[00:55:07] <fugutive221> When it calls on a td hide and then show again and then toggle. Toggle will iterate it multiple times
[00:56:39] <jphase> fugutive221: add .stop before your toggle
[00:58:18] <fugutive221> jphase: thanks, it works :D !
[00:58:32] <jphase> ;]

[01:16:43] <sticky_> i can't get respond.js to work, ie7 and 8 don¬¥t understando media queries. what can i do?
[01:33:46] <SprkDev> Does anyone know a link to a plugin where we have "show more" or "show less" text where it expands? I've found and implemented one that increases the height. But that isn't really a solution is it. Cause the amount of text will always vary in my case
[01:35:57] <anli> All calls to .live always changeable to .on ?
[01:36:32] <Cork> no
[01:36:49] <Cork> you can't ever replace .live with .on straight of
[01:37:08] <Cork> anli: .live was replaced by .delegate; and on can express the same thing as delegate
[01:37:22] <Cork> but it is a completely different syntax to .live
[01:37:34] <Cork> and that is why .live was deprecated and removed
[01:37:39] <Cork> cause it's syntax was broken
[01:38:31] <anli> Well, I know another good reason
[01:39:15] <anli> Event handlers for not yet known elements is not a good thing, I think
[01:39:53] <Cork> anli: it is
[01:39:57] <anli> Why?
[01:39:58] <Cork> anli: and delegate does that
[01:40:12] <Cork> anli: cause the basic of it is that you add an event handler to a parent
[01:40:18] <Cork> instead of hundreds to every child
[01:40:37] <anli> hm
[01:40:49] <Cork> so you replace a lot of event handlers added to the target with one event handler on a parent that handles all the children
[01:40:51] <anli> Must think about it
[01:40:57] <Cork> read delegate
[01:41:11] <Cork> it gives a better base then .live for understanding how it works
[01:41:13] <anli> I always initiate events when I create elements on the fly, so it is not a big deal actually
[01:41:13] <Cork> ?api delegate
[01:41:14] <b-ot> Cork: .delegate(): Attach a handler to one or more events for all elements that match the selector, now or in the future, based on a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[01:41:19] <anli> ok
[01:41:22] <anli> Will read
[01:41:28] <Cork> anli: ya, but that means you pay a price for all those event listeners
[01:41:43] <Cork> and it is significant if you have a lot of child elements
[01:41:52] <Cork> like ex. rows in a table or similar
[01:41:52] <anli> Oh, I never have around 1000 elements even
[01:42:08] <anli> I bet the performance is not an issue
[01:42:13] <Cork> it is
[01:42:22] <anli> Only if the difference is noticeable
[01:42:23] <Cork> i've rewrote pages cause of the cost of event listeners
[01:42:27] <anli> aha
[01:42:40] <Cork> it was a speed difference of 2x and almost 3x
[01:42:54] <anli> But 2x of almost nothing is almost nothing, right?
[01:43:20] <Cork> it was the difference between waiting 3 seconds for the table to render
[01:43:26] <anli> wow, 3 seconds
[01:43:27] <Cork> and it just "haning"
[01:43:36] <anli> Then I understood you had to take measures
[01:43:41] <Cork> anli: if it is 3 sec for every time you scroll it is a lot
[01:43:45] <anli> yeah
[01:43:46] <jop008> If I use jquery moble am I using HTML 5 as well?
[01:44:03] <Cork> jop008: it uses some new html features yes
[01:44:18] <Cork> and also some css3 features
[01:44:35] <Cork> jop008: if you want to specify what you mean by html5 it would be possible to say more
[01:44:54] <Cork> as html5 is just a propaganda word, without technical meaning
[01:44:55] <jop008> Can I make a good looking jquery mobile site. Now I have this http://www.happyaway.nl/search.htm
[01:46:08] <jop008> I am looking for help for somebody for a good feeling on making eye candy web sites my page is a bit ...
[01:46:25] <jop008> So who can help me on this (for money)
[01:46:46] <Cork> jop008: nope that page doesn't use css3 or any of the new html form features
[01:47:06] <Cork> if there is anything else you want to ask about just ask it
[01:47:35] <jop008> So am I doing things wrong?
[01:47:56] <jop008> I want my site to work on all browsers including IE8
[01:48:44] <jop008> I am dependent on jqmobile framework for the form fields
[01:48:44] <Cork> jop008: to clarify, html5 means javascript animation, interactive interfaces, css3, codecs, responsive design, html forms, html canvas, html audio, html video, html file api, webworkers, websocket, speedy and so on
[01:49:00] <Cork> so it basically is pointless when you ask if something is using anything
[01:49:07] <Cork> cause you basically can always say "yes"
[01:49:18] <Cork> heck ie4 supports much of html5
[01:49:44] <jop008> But can my site become better looking ( independent of html5)
[01:49:50] <Cork> yes
[01:50:00] <Cork> that is css possibly with css3
[01:50:03] <jop008> and you have time to help me?
[01:50:10] <Cork> to do what?
[01:50:20] <jop008> to improve my pages
[01:50:38] <Cork> to that kind of a generic question; no
[01:50:51] <Cork> if you have specific things you want done you can ask how you do it and i will try to help
[01:50:59] <jop008> like this one http://www.happyaway.nl/search.htm
[01:51:03] <seutje> how to make it pop?
[01:51:12] <Cork> make what pop?
[01:51:21] <Cork> oh...
[01:51:22] <seutje> you know... design :P
[01:51:24] <Cork> seutje: ... >_<
[01:51:32] <Cork> don't trick me! :P
[01:51:53] <seutje> sry, born a troll... always a troll
[01:51:57] <jop008> A better header a favicon and a form which is nice looking are one of the things I like to improve
[01:51:58] <Cork> :)
[01:52:24] <chxane> jop008, you might want to try a freelancer site
[01:52:55] <Cork> jop008: that is goal, and yes if you want someone to do it for you
[01:53:01] <seutje> form already looks kinda nice imo, migh wanna implement a stylesheet for larger resolutions though
[01:53:03] <Cork> you most likely want to look for payed work
[01:53:32] <diverdude> does anybody have a nice timepicker alternative to this one: http://jdewit.github.io/bootstrap-timepicker/ which unfortunately dont work with twitter-bootstrap 3 :( ?
[01:53:32] <Cork> here it is direct question i want to make this do this, how do i do it
[01:53:37] <Cork> "not make things better"
[01:53:58] <jop008> I tried freelance sites but no success
[01:54:12] <Cork> diverdude: there are a page that list like 10 different plugins
[01:54:19] <seutje> search button isn't very well lined up with the login button
[01:54:42] <jop008> So yourself is not an option?
[01:54:57] <chxane> jop008, are you looking to pay for the work?
[01:55:12] <chxane> no one here will do that for free
[01:56:01] <jop008> Yes for free is also good :-)
[01:56:17] <chxane> lol
[01:56:22] <Cork> please look for a freelance channel as this isn't the channel for it
[01:56:33] <jop008> I  want to launch my site and try to find customers
[01:56:55] <Cork> here you come to get help understanding how you do something
[01:57:09] <Cork> not to get someone else to do it
[01:57:25] <jop008> It cost me more time to seach one in the mean tiime I can try to improve my self :-)
[01:57:36] <Cork> then do so
[02:02:00] <dieguezz> hi, is there a way to extend the area of .mouseout() ? i want to leave a bit of margin, and not mouseout just after leaving the box.
[02:02:50] <seutje> `g hoverintent
[02:02:51] <b-ot> seutje: hoverIntent jQuery Plug-in - Cherne.net ‚Üí http://cherne.net/brian/resources/jquery.hoverIntent.html
[02:03:20] <seutje> dieguezz: ^ might be what ur looking for
[02:03:33] <chxane> dieguezz, you mean the margin of the html element you are calling mouseout on?
[02:03:46] <dieguezz> yeah chxane
[02:03:59] <chxane> that is something you would need to do with the css
[02:04:04] <chxane> of the element
[02:04:37] <seutje> or use a wrapper and do ur events on the wrapper
[02:05:10] <ravenzz> so whenever I change the scope within an each $(Element).attr(dataAttr); returns undefined whilst $(Element).data(dataAttr); returns a proper value, how so?
[02:05:11] <ravenzz> http://jsfiddle.net/TU248/
[02:05:14] <chxane> that also if you want to use a plugin
[02:05:28] <dieguezz> kk tyvm
[02:05:37] <seutje> or use a transparent border instead of margin (although this won't collapse like margin does)
[02:06:47] <seutje> ravenzz: the attribute isn't '[data-type]', it's 'data-type'
[02:06:58] <ravenzz> ugh
[02:07:05] <ravenzz> silly me
[02:07:25] <seutje> ravenzz: http://jsfiddle.net/TU248/1/
[02:07:58] <seutje> ravenzz: do note that .data('foo') and .attr('data-foo') can give different results
[02:08:03] <ravenzz> I would like it to accept any filter
[02:08:20] <ravenzz> seutje I know eheh
[02:11:04] <Cork> ravenzz: attr doesn't accept filters at all
[02:11:12] <Cork> it accepts attribute names
[02:11:14] <ravenzz> "filter"
[02:11:38] <Cork> and if you could have <div [data-type]="something> it would match
[02:11:44] <ravenzz> but maybe it is better to stick with data-attributes
[02:12:03] <ravenzz> and forget about other "filters" like classnames ids
[02:12:31] <jop008> Can someone tell me if these page looks nice for users? http://www.happyaway.nl/search.htm http://www.happyaway/list-entry.htm ? Must I improve things?
[02:12:38] <Cork> ravenzz: attr() is a short for elm.getAttriute()
[02:12:45] <ravenzz> Cork I know!
[02:12:46] <Cork> ravenzz: it isn't a filter in any way or form
[02:12:52] <seutje> ravenzz: why the .bind(types)?
[02:13:22] <seutje> could just use types instead of this, same scope anyway
[02:13:51] <ravenzz> seutje because that is part of a constructor where I have this.types
[02:14:14] <ravenzz> so it will actually be .bind(this)
[02:14:23] <seutje> oh ok, that makes sense
[02:19:59] <Cork> ravenzz: side not i would prob write the this[type] part as this[type] = this[type] || 0; this[type]++;
[02:20:06] <Cork> less if cases :)
[02:21:15] <seutje> imo, it should catch undefined attributes and throw them
[02:22:30] <Cork> throw?
[02:22:39] <Cork> it builds an object of found types
[02:22:50] <Cork> all types will be undefined at one point
[02:25:28] <seutje> oh wait, it filters the set on that attribute first
[02:25:39] <seutje> yeah, then that condition would never be met
[02:27:03] <diverdude> , what does this line do? <link rel="canonical" href="http://bootstrapformhelpers.com/datepicker/"/>
[02:27:40] <seutje> tells bots where the root is
[02:28:02] <SprkDev> Does anyone know a link to a plugin where we have "show more" or "show less" text where it expands? I've found and implemented one that increases the height. But that isn't really a solution is it. Cause the amount of text will always vary in my case
[02:28:06] <seutje> like every page that points to the same canonical is considered 1 big website
[02:28:16] <Cork> diverdude: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canonical_link_element
[02:28:23] <seutje> pages that point to a different canonical within the same domain might appear as different results
[02:29:12] <traets> what was that jquery method that lets you go back an item in the chain?
[02:29:19] <d3m0n> Hey guys, I've been setting up a parallax effect on my site and noticed there's a jerkyness when using the mousewheel to scroll on Chrome and Opera, anyone fimilar with this and know of a fix?
[02:29:44] <seutje> `jqapi end
[02:29:45] <d3m0n> (Firefox handles it fine)
[02:29:54] <seutje> traets: end
[02:30:11] <traets> seutje: thanks
[02:30:13] <Cork> traets: .parent() ? .closest() ? .end() ?
[02:30:19] <traets> its end()
[02:31:25] <seutje> d3m0n: are you changing the background position of an element on scroll?
[02:32:27] <d3m0n> seutje: I am changing background image position on one div and a top position on another element both have a jerk a bit
[02:32:44] <d3m0n> both jerk a bit*
[02:32:59] <Cork> d3m0n: do you have smooth scroll on of off in firefox?
[02:33:04] <Cork> (it is on by default)
[02:33:12] <Cork> *on or off
[02:33:23] <d3m0n> I haven't turn it off, so I'll take a guess and say it's on
[02:33:28] <d3m0n> turned*
[02:33:43] <Cork> cause i know chrome doesn't do that and it might cause the effect you see
[02:33:51] <seutje> try animating instead of setting the css
[02:33:54] <Cork> try turning if off and see if they look the same
[02:34:07] <seutje> might be interesting to look into how stellar handles things
[02:34:37] <d3m0n> Cork: Yep, you're correct, smooth scrolling as on and turning it off gives me the same jerkiness
[02:35:11] <Cork> ok, so you need to handle the jumping scrollweeks cause (the amplification)
[02:35:41] <Cork> as most wheels move in steps
[02:36:53] <Cork> just remember that the amplifier can me changed in most systems
[02:37:03] <Cork> so it isn't a static value
[02:37:14] <d3m0n> I am unfimilar with the term scrollweeks
[02:37:25] <Cork> lol
[02:37:34] <Cork> typo
[02:37:43] <Cork> i mean scrollwheels :)
[02:38:03] <seutje> it's the amount of time you're scrolling in the span of a week
[02:38:10] <Cork> :)
[02:38:18] <d3m0n> Oh lol ok, is that a solution jquery can fix
[02:38:37] <Cork> d3m0n: you would have to resort to using animations
[02:38:45] <seutje> so say you're at your machine for a good 10 hrs a day and you're not fond of clicking mouse3, you might end up with a scrollweek of 56 hours
[02:38:49] <Cork> and take the amount the scrollTop has changed
[02:38:57] <Cork> and make a smooth animations between the two
[02:39:19] <seutje> or throttle ur onscroll and css transition all the things!
[02:39:19] <Cork> that is what firefox smooth scrolling does
[02:39:47] <Cork> (and is why i disable it; cause it makes scrolling sooo slow)
[02:40:03] <d3m0n> ahh okay makes sense
[02:40:23] <seutje> yea, luckily I can toggle my mouse from ticks to smooth, and then I can just give it a whirl and let it spin wildly for 10 secs
[02:40:29] <d3m0n> I'll see what I can do, thanks a lot
[02:40:41] <d3m0n> Might take me a scrollweek but no problem
[02:40:42] <seutje> but seriously, you should look into the 7 million other parallax thingies out there
[02:40:57] <Cork> seutje: sure, but firefox will grab each mousescroll event and make an animation between each click
[02:40:59] <seutje> most are pretty shit though
[02:41:13] <Cork> seutje: so with smooth scroll on it will take several times longs for the scroll to complete
[02:41:17] <d3m0n> I was looking at tutorials and noticed all of them jump too
[02:41:23] <d3m0n> So it does seem common
[02:41:24] <seutje> Cork: it works though
[02:41:31] <Cork> and the longer you scroll the more you see the effect
[02:41:37] <Cork> seutje: sure
[02:41:40] <seutje> when I toggle loose and whirl it, I usually end up at the bottom of any page within .2 secs
[02:41:55] <Cork> seutje: in firefox with smooth on?
[02:42:01] <seutje> yeah
[02:42:04] <Cork> wow
[02:42:08] <seutje> still slower than the chromesies, but not entirely shit
[02:42:09] <Cork> i don't
[02:42:22] <Cork> (and yes i am using such a wheel too)
[02:42:52] <Cork> seutje: well just disable the smooth option and it will scroll exactly like chrome
[02:43:03] <seutje> only use FF to debug FF
[02:43:08] <Cork> :)
[02:43:17] <seutje> and when peppermint is throwing a fit again
[02:43:48] <seutje> or just pepper, whatever
[02:43:50] <seutje> the flash thing
[02:45:00] <jop008> Is there a way to detect if the device supports full html text editing?
[02:45:20] <seutje> u mean like contenteditable?
[02:45:24] <jop008> I have a large html field with tables in it
[02:45:30] <seutje> an html field?
[02:45:36] <seutje> <input type="html"> ?
[02:45:43] <jop008> Yes like that
[02:45:47] <Cork> O_o
[02:45:49] <seutje> so... a textfield
[02:46:07] <jop008> it is an invoice field and the user may need to adjust the invoice
[02:46:20] <Cork> jop008: there is no type="html" ...
[02:46:48] <Cork> there is contentEditable and i suspect that is what you're looking for
[02:47:01] <Cork> ?mdn contentEditable
[02:47:02] <b-ot> Cork: Content Editable - Mozilla Developer Network ‚Üí https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Content_Editable
[02:47:04] <jop008> But you do have full text widget
[02:47:11] <jop008> s
[02:47:38] <seutje> if it's an invoice, consider making only the necessary things editable
[02:47:54] <Cork> jop008: are you talking about wysiwyg editors?
[02:48:07] <seutje> and consider saving yourself a bunch of pain by using fake satelite textfields
[02:48:24] <ravenzz> Cork good one ;)
[02:49:11] <jop008> Content editable looks good but no bold italic etc stuff (like ms word looking)
[02:49:25] <jop008> wysiwyg
[02:49:48] <Cork> jop008: wysiwyg editors is built around contentEditable
[02:49:56] <Cork> contentEditable is what makes the content editable
[02:49:59] <jop008> So I want to detect if I can use wysiwyg
[02:50:06] <Cork> if you want toolbar buttons you need to add that your self
[02:50:20] <Cork> jop008: all browsers support contentEditable
[02:50:28] <jop008> even IE8?
[02:50:35] <Cork> ie4 supported it
[02:50:43] <Cork> natscape 3 supported it
[02:50:55] <jop008> great and even table editing can be done
[02:50:57] <Cork> it has been around for AGES
[02:50:59] <jop008> ?
[02:51:02] <Cork> yes
[02:51:10] <jop008> allright thanks
[02:51:15] <Cork> though that is a bit clonky though
[02:51:20] <Cork> normally at least
[02:52:12] <SprkDev> Does anyone know a link to a plugin where we have "show more" or "show less" text where it expands? I've found and implemented one that increases the height. But that isn't really a solution is it. Cause the amount of text will always vary in my case
[02:55:05] <karstenk1977_> hello
[02:55:13] <karstenk1977_> plz have a look on this  http://pastebin.com/sYvUyUeU
[02:55:17] <uwjesq> I have a problem in flexslider, where the navigation is displayed off the screen. Could not find anything on the interwebs. Any idea? Speculations... everything welcome.
[02:55:50] <SprkDev> was that directed at me?
[02:55:59] <karstenk1977_> what can I do, that my jquery function above will do
[03:02:26] <seutje> jop008: actually, bold/italic and stuff was the reason I would use fake hidden inputs for an invoice
[03:02:32] <seutje> u don't want ppl throwing markup in there
[03:03:00] <seutje> enters insert divs/paragraphs seemingly at random
[03:19:31] <bantu_> I have 3 dropdowns - country, state and city at the moment. I want to keep the default value which I have taken care of by using AJAX and sending hardcoded values. But now I want to dynamically add to the dropdown on onchange event of state and city. How would I effectively and cleanly do this? http://bpaste.net/show/F3FlHNBcs9rtpv5GAJeb/
[03:25:08] <sasmit87> Hi all... can somebody tell me what is this js error on change of select state list here http://dev.freshersworld.com/user/register
[03:33:33] <adammcarth> $("html").insertBefore("element"); is working for me, but I can't get pre-existing jQuery click functions to hook into the ID's that I set in the inserted HTML... am I doing something wrong or is it impossible?
[03:33:59] <karstenk1977_> is there an easy way to get ONLY the browser region?
[03:34:22] <karstenk1977_> without that the user has to accept the sending?!
[04:29:11] <valtido> hi all,
[04:29:21] <karstenk1977_> <karstenk1977_> does anybody is very experienced with the google api v3?<karstenk1977_> i only want to know, if there is a method to test if the region is inside a address?!
[04:30:05] <valtido> was wondering if anyone likes the idea of listing all properties if there is no arguements passed to the .attr() and .prop() methods in jquery?
[04:43:40] <dfdsf> $("#suburban").empty() does not empty the select dropdown. what am i missing here?
[04:53:04] <valtido> $("#suburban").html("")???
[04:53:23] <Cork> he already left
[04:53:42] <Cork> but empty() is the same thing as .html('')
[04:58:09] <nisseni> I'm adding a new row like this: $('#table_'+prodgrp_id+' tr.produktrad:last').after(newRow); - the new tr has the class="produktrad" - however, trying to add another row doesn't work, how can I fix this?
[04:59:29] <Cork> why not just $('#table_'+prodgrp_id).append(newRow) ?
[04:59:51] <Cork> oh, and don't forget tbody
[05:00:00] <Cork> why not just $('#table_'+prodgrp_id + ' tbody').append(newRow) ?
[05:00:03] <nisseni> Cork: because I have other rows under the ones with class produktrow
[05:00:28] <Cork> nisseni: are you running that selector each time?
[05:00:32] <Cork> or are you storing it?
[05:00:56] <nisseni> not sure what you mean, but it should add a new row on change of the select
[05:01:14] <nisseni> Cork: I'm making a new row each time since it needs various ids and stuff
[05:01:16] <Cork> nisseni: i mean are you doing something like target = $('#table_'+prodgrp_id+' tr.produktrad:last');
[05:01:27] <nisseni> Cork: nope
[05:01:28] <Cork> and on(... target.after()
[05:01:42] <Cork> could you produce a fiddle example of the problem?
[05:02:07] <nisseni> I could try
[05:03:10] <shoky> nisseni: probably you're not making a new row element each time
[05:03:19] <shoky> but you keep appending the same reference
[05:03:30] <Cork> ah, good one
[05:03:37] <shoky> prolly need to .after(newRow.clone())  or something
[05:05:42] <nisseni> shoky: did that before, that's what I want to avoid
[05:05:53] <nisseni> but the thing is, I'm getting the data from the selection
[05:06:37] <shoky> donno what you mean
[05:07:08] <nisseni> http://jsfiddle.net/vFvrM/ - not sure if that gives you anything
[05:07:11] <nisseni> it doesn't work tho
[05:07:54] <shoky> oh newRow is html
[05:08:21] <nisseni> http://jsfiddle.net/vFvrM/1/
[05:08:26] <nisseni> shoky: yes
[05:10:27] <nisseni> http://jsfiddle.net/vFvrM/3/
[05:10:34] <nisseni> thisone works as it works on my version
[05:10:55] <nisseni> lol, or not, because here it works with multiple rows
[05:11:11] <shoky> yes..
[05:11:45] <BoF> alguien que me pueda dar una mano con jquery
[05:12:44] <shoky> BoF: if you ask in english
[05:13:58] <nisseni> got it I think
[05:15:26] <sunbeam> if i needed to print a list of images (<ul>) twice with PHP (the same list).. what can I best do to optimize?
[05:16:04] <asdfz0mg> sunbeam: you know this is #jquery?
[05:16:48] <chilversc_> is there anyway to get a variable from the current context by name?
[05:16:58] <BoF> shoky: is hard:(
[05:17:06] <BoF> i try
[05:17:07] <chilversc_> eg, similar to when you have; with (foo) { return bar; } that could return a property called bar from foo
[05:17:11] <BoF> mmm
[05:17:17] <BoF> i have this
[05:17:19] <sunbeam> asdfz0mg: so
[05:17:47] <BoF> i need to get
[05:18:00] <sunbeam> I mean so the user does not have to load the same list twice
[05:18:31] <asdfz0mg> sunbeam: your question didn't have anything to do with jquery as far a I can tell
[05:18:38] <Cork> chilversc_: do you mean get a list of variable names or what do you mean?
[05:18:38] <asdfz0mg> what are you trying to do?
[05:18:41] <BoF> i need to get echo "<td><button  class='ActualizarDocumento'><a href='http://clarodac.com/admin/ingresos/AgregarDocumento.php?nDocumento=$row[nDocumento]' title='Actualizar Proveedor'></a>";
[05:18:59] <chilversc_> Cork: just trying to work out how to get a syntax within knockout that refers to a value by a path
[05:19:02] <Cork> BoF: your button isn't closed :)
[05:19:03] <BoF> i need get $row[nDocumento]
[05:19:05] <BoF> :(
[05:19:15] <chilversc_> Cork: so wanted something like; data-bind="value: ko.path('foo.bar.baz')"
[05:19:31] <BoF> Cork: my button is closed
[05:19:39] <BoF> past a part of code
[05:19:49] <sunbeam> asdfz0mg: maybe it does, why shouldn't i clone the first list with jquery?
[05:19:49] <chilversc_> Cork: normally the syntax would be; data-bind="value: foo.bar.baz" and I knockout makes this work using the with keyword
[05:20:04] <sunbeam> asdfz0mg: so the user does not have to load the list twice
[05:20:23] <Cork> chilversc_: ok, so your depending on some framework that uses eval it sounds like
[05:20:54] <asdfz0mg> sunbeam: i thought you were going to print the list twice with php
[05:21:08] <asdfz0mg> sunbeam: but you wanna print it once and the clone it with jquery?
[05:21:11] <sunbeam> asdfz0mg: yes, but i'm not sure if thats efficient
[05:21:18] <sunbeam> asdfz0mg: maybe yea, I just wrote code for that
[05:21:24] <sunbeam> but I don't know how efficient that is
[05:21:31] <chilversc_> Cork: yeah
[05:21:49] <Cork> chilversc_: can't really help you then
[05:21:51] <shoky> chilversc: i don't understand what you want. and i know KO btw
[05:21:56] <shoky> but.. why ask here
[05:22:22] <sunbeam> Cork or shoky do you have any idea if its efficient what I do?
[05:22:34] <shoky> sunbeam: does it work? is it slow?
[05:22:44] <sunbeam> it does
[05:22:44] <asdfz0mg> sunbeam: you should probably print it twice with php in that case
[05:22:55] <asdfz0mg> sunbeam: the the client doesnt have to do any work
[05:22:57] <sunbeam> asdfz0mg: ok, ill stick to that, but for which reason is it more efficient?
[05:23:05] <sunbeam> asdfz0mg: the client simply already cached the images the first time
[05:23:10] <sunbeam> Is that what you mean?
[05:24:11] <asdfz0mg> sunbeam: well yeah, the client will only have to download the images once but if you render the markup on the server the client doesn't have to run any extra javascript code in order to clone the list and then append it
[05:24:25] <asdfz0mg> the client will just have to render the markup from the server and that's it
[05:24:41] <seutje> cloning is dead easy though
[05:24:45] <asdfz0mg> but it depends what you want to do with your list.
[05:25:01] <sunbeam> just show it twice
[05:25:03] <sunbeam> the same images
[05:25:05] <asdfz0mg> if you want it to be dynamic maybe you should go all jquery
[05:25:09] <sunbeam> ok ill just print the array twice
[05:25:11] <sunbeam> thats it
[05:25:30] <chilversc_> shoky: I wanted to make a method that takes a string, splits by '.' then follows each part unwrapping it as it goes while checking for nulls
[05:25:44] <asdfz0mg> well, that'll have less impact on the client render time
[05:25:50] <shoky> chilversc_: uh.. ok
[05:26:16] <seutje> chilversc_: u mean like... shizzle?
[05:26:37] <chilversc_> shoky: otherwise if you have; data-bind="value: foo.bar" and foo is null, you get an error, and instead get syntax like data-bind="value: foo() != null ? foo().bar : null"
[05:27:02] <seutje> :|
[05:27:37] <shoky> chilversc_: or you make sure it's not null, or you wrap it in a "with" binding
[05:28:26] <asdfz0mg> MDN says using with is not recommended, https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/with
[05:28:43] <shoky> asdfz0mg: not that "with"
[05:28:44] <chilversc_> shoky: that's annoying when accessing a single parameter though, such as if I just want to show foo.name
[05:28:55] <asdfz0mg> shoky: oh, ok :P
[05:28:58] <shoky> why would you want to show foo.name if foo is null ?
[05:29:28] <chilversc_> shoky: I want to show an empty field instead, ie null
[05:30:11] <chilversc_> shoky: I thought I'd just create a small function that follows the path, only normally I'd do something like; this['foo'], only here the context for this isn't changed (since ko is using with)
[05:30:12] <asdfz0mg> Sry I haven't used KO in a while. Didn't know about the with binding
[05:30:20] <shoky> then do so, but you have to do the check of course, in some way
[05:30:50] <chilversc_> so was wondering if in javascript there was some way to do the equivilent of; this['foo'] only, where 'foo' comes from the current context
[05:31:01] <shoky> chilversc_: $data['foo']
[05:31:08] <shoky> or $data.foo
[05:31:15] <shoky> that won't raise an error
[05:31:23] <shoky> but $data.foo.bar will
[05:31:31] <shoky> iirc
[05:31:53] <shoky> anyway, move this to #knockoutjs
[05:32:22] <valtido> $._data($('.master_li_tab'),'events')
[05:32:29] <valtido> how come this doesn't work for me ?
[05:32:47] <seutje> shoky: just try catch those hole thing and call it a day :D
[05:32:53] <shoky> valtido:  $('.master_li_tab')[0]  to get the element
[05:33:03] <seutje> valtido: it expects DOM element, not jQuery collection
[05:33:15] <valtido> I have tried that too, but it does not work...
[05:33:23] <shoky> seutje: heh dono what you mean ;D
[05:33:36] <seutje> shoky: I SHOW YOU!! :P
[05:33:47] <shoky> :P
[05:33:56] <seutje> valtido: is there a posibility it doesn't have any events bound right to it?
[05:34:46] <valtido> ok, i did the following I think, but I will double check... var clicker = $('blabla'); $._data(clicker[0],'events')
[05:35:14] <shoky> valtido: and the events were bound using jquery?
[05:35:44] <shoky> and are you sure it's on that specific element?  and not maybe delegated
[05:35:48] <seutje> valtido: <blabla> is not an element I ever heard of, but I'ma assume this is supposed to resemble a valid selector ;)
[05:36:05] <seutje> but it would be more interesting to see the line that binds it
[05:36:19] <seutje> because as shoky said, if ur delegating, it'll be on a higher level element
[05:37:19] <valtido> it was just an example
[05:38:18] <shoky> make a jsfiddle demonstrating your issue
[05:38:33] <seutje> valtido: I know, but your example doesn't rly convey a lot of useful info
[05:38:54] <seutje> all these pseudo-code shenanigans are just obfuscating the real issue
[05:39:03] <valtido> don't worry guys, cheers all good now... I was just being stupid
[05:39:16] <valtido> wrong selector ...
[05:39:17] <seutje> now I'm all curious what the issue was :(
[05:39:21] <seutje> I wanna be stupid as well!
[05:39:50] <seutje> oh, you see! I was right moaning about the 'blabla'!
[05:40:03] <seutje> who'da thunk?!
[05:40:26] * shoky throw seutje half a cookie
[05:40:30] <shoky> throws*
[05:40:45] <seutje> ooh, something I can try/catch :D
[05:40:52] <shoky> finally!
[05:42:20] <Dirkos> In my console i do: >>> $('#package-form'); Object[form#package-form.form-horizontal]
[05:42:39] <Dirkos> thing is that when i do a $('#package-form').submit(); the form wont be submitted and nothing happens
[05:43:28] <shoky> `demo
[05:43:28] <b-ot> shoky: Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[05:45:13] <seutje> Dirkos: something is probably calling preventDefault on the submit event
[05:46:12] <Dirkos> seutje: well i have a preventDefault on the btn click but that should be an issue is it?
[05:46:28] <seutje> nah, should be something preventdefaulting on the form's submit event
[05:46:40] <seutje> u can bypass it by calling submit on the DOM element iirc
[05:46:50] <Dirkos> how can i see that?
[05:46:52] <seutje> like $('#package-form')[0].sibmut()
[05:46:56] <seutje> lol, sibmut...
[05:47:09] <seutje> like $('#package-form')[0].submit()
[05:47:24] <seutje> what do u mean "dyslexia", dunno whatchu talkin'bout!
[05:47:45] <Dirkos> seutje: TypeError: $(...)[0].submit is not a function
[05:47:57] <seutje> durrr
[05:48:12] <seutje> log $('#package-form').length
[05:48:32] <Dirkos> length = 1
[05:48:34] <seutje> either it's not matching anything, or matching something that isn't a form
[05:48:37] <Dirkos> just like expected
[05:48:44] <seutje> log $('#package-form')[0].nodeName
[05:48:46] <Dirkos> dom tells me its a form?
[05:48:55] <Dirkos> >>> $('#package-form')[0].nodeName "FORM"
[05:48:58] <seutje> I'm tweaking or something
[05:50:25] <Dirkos> seutje: as you can see it has to work but strange enough it isnt.. and to be honest, im looking for this for more then 30min already and cant find it
[05:50:54] <seutje> log HTMLFormElement.prototype.submit
[05:51:07] <seutje> starting to think something in the page asploded that
[05:51:18] <seutje> as in delete HTMLFormElement.prototype.submit
[05:51:20] <seutje> or some shit
[05:52:27] <Dirkos> HTMLFormElement.prototype.submit returns the submit function
[05:52:37] <seutje> what the poop
[05:52:42] <seutje> seems kinda silly to go all HTMLFormElement.prototype.submit.apply($('#foo')[0])
[05:53:09] <seutje> try that, just for kicks
[05:53:13] <shoky> Dirkos: b-ot's advice was directed at you
[05:53:28] <seutje> yeah, a full demo would really be useful at this point
[05:53:33] <seutje> weirdo shit is weirdo
[05:54:02] <Dirkos> seutje: yeah i understand but it is hard to extract but trying
[05:54:16] <seutje> tell me about it
[05:54:25] <Dirkos> HTMLFormElement.prototype.submit.apply($('#package-form')[0]) worked lol
[05:54:37] <seutje> hit a rendering issue in a backbone app, been trying for like 3 days to make an isolated testcase q.q
[05:54:47] <shoky> what does  console.log( $('#package-form')[0].submit ) give you
[05:55:04] <seutje> I *know* it's a webkit paint issue, but can't manage to isolate
[05:55:28] <Dirkos> shoky: <button class="btn btn-large btn-primary" value="" type="button" name="submit">
[05:55:31] <seutje> holy shit, this isn't gonna be some fucked up Object.prototype extension issue, is it?
[05:55:34] <shoky> Dirkos: ah :)
[05:55:39] <seutje> MOTHERFUCKER
[05:55:43] <Dirkos> what does it mean?
[05:55:55] <seutje> something asploded that form's submit method
[05:56:00] <seutje> oh no
[05:56:01] <seutje> the name
[05:56:02] <shoky> don't name your button submit
[05:56:10] <seutje> holy shit, that's stupid
[05:56:21] <shoky> heh
[05:56:24] <seutje> DOM is so dumb
[05:56:42] <shoky> aye
[05:57:02] <Dirkos> roflol
[05:58:06] <Dirkos> thnx for the help
[05:58:38] <seutje> wonder what happens if u name an input "onclick" or some shit
[05:58:53] <seutje> spec has no mention of this, it seems :/
[05:59:02] <shoky> i think they put you on trial for that
[06:00:29] <BoF> <button class="dog" value="msg"></button>  <button class="dog" value="msg1"></button> when i try this alert($(".ActualizarDocumento").val()); i get the same message :( help

[06:05:42] <adammcarth> How come when I insert html using methods like .after() or .insertAfter() it doesn't get formatted correctly, but when I resize the browser and go back it becomes magically formatted again...?
[06:05:48] <shoky> er nevermind me
[06:06:27] <Cork> adammcarth: cause either you're modifying it with js, or you arn't matching the same rules as the original
[06:06:42] <seutje> adammcarth: is this in webkit? if so, try it in firefox, might be a paint issue
[06:06:51] <adammcarth> Fixed it, yolo
[06:06:51] <Cork> adammcarth: ex $('').button() modifies the html
[06:07:10] <adammcarth> One problem I still face though guys
[06:07:21] <seutje> "yolo" really?
[06:07:32] * seutje walks away
[06:08:00] <adammcarth> .onclick() doesn't work with a link I've inserted... is it meant to be like that or is that a problem?
[06:08:15] <adammcarth> (and existing onclick handler for a link with that id)
[06:08:46] <adammcarth> seutje: Haha, it's my youth mentality - can't help it.
[06:09:35] <adammcarth> any ideas Cork?
[06:09:54] <Cork> you need to use delegated event listeners
[06:10:04] <Cork> or rebind the event listeners for all new elements
[06:10:42] <adammcarth> rebind them :S?
[06:10:53] <adammcarth> as in call them again after my content has been inserted
[06:12:53] <BoF> thanks $( this ).val()
[06:14:18] <Cork> adammcarth: look into delegated event listeners
[06:14:24] <Cork> it is most likely what you want to use
[06:14:28] <adammcarth> will do, thanks mate
[06:14:30] <Cork> ?api delegate
[06:14:30] <b-ot> Cork: .delegate(): Attach a handler to one or more events for all elements that match the selector, now or in the future, based on a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[06:15:08] <adammcarth> could I just add the .click(); listener into a function and then call that after the new content has been inserted?
[06:15:17] <adammcarth> well, I mean I could, but is that bad practise I mean?
[06:15:33] <Cork> adammcarth: yes
[06:16:43] <Cork> it can easily be wieldy having the events be rebound
[06:17:14] <Cork> adammcarth: and you want to use delegate anyway if you have many elements that you want to do the same action
[06:17:22] <Cork> cause then you can reduce the number of event listeners
[06:17:42] <adammcarth> yeah I'm with you, nice.

[06:24:15] <mls_> hi there, anyone knows the FileReader polyfill from Jahdrien ?
[06:49:07] <Ascendion> looking for help with jsTree or Dynatree -- both are giving me more or less the same problem -- the script is loading and initializing, I'm calling the jstree/dynatree method on the selector for my HTML based tree, but neither adds any tree functionality
[06:53:27] <BoF> what is wrong here   <?php
[06:53:28] <BoF> 		   		$Nombre="<script> $( this ).val(); </script>";
[06:53:29] <BoF> 		    ?>
[06:53:31] <BoF> thanks
[06:54:59] <Clex> BoF: PHP is executed on server side, JavaScript is executed on client side.
[06:56:14] <shoky> and $( this ).val();  doesn't do anything anyway
[06:56:22] <BoF> Clex: then i need to send this var to php and get()
[06:58:43] <Ascendion> here is a cut down version of the page that I'm testing with >> http://hastebin.com/cirexibanu.xml
[06:59:05] <BoF> i have a very hard problem

[07:04:02] <mls_> hi there, anyone knows the FileReader polyfill from Jahdrien ?
[07:04:32] <utvecklare> hi all, I need some help with a dragndrop plugin. Problem being getting the file from the clientside to the serverside in a post parameter
[07:06:39] <utvecklare> its a rails application and I got a post parameter assigned to a variable connected to a input file field but the drag n drop needs to be connected to a contenteditable div
[07:07:49] <utvecklare> so I need the drag n drop plugin to add the files to the input file element
[07:15:43] <ph88> if a user is typing in an input box and then click with the mouse somewhere else, how is the event of the input box not having the type-cursor anymore called ?
[07:17:53] <grafi> focusout?
[07:19:14] <ph88> or blur ?
[07:21:14] <grafi> The focusout event is sent to an element when it, or any element inside of it, loses focus. This is distinct from the blur event in that it supports detecting the loss of focus on descendant elements (in other words, it supports event bubbling).
[07:21:16] <grafi> ph8
[07:21:20] <grafi> ph88
[07:21:22] <grafi> there you go :P
[07:21:38] <ph88> i've no idea what that means :D
[07:21:51] <ph88> how can an input box have descendant elements ?? o_O
[07:23:34] <grafi> it cant
[07:23:49] <grafi> but blur apparently can apply to non form elements too
[07:24:26] <grafi> the short answer it probably it doesnt really matter which one you use
[07:24:28] <grafi> :P

[07:28:59] <squeakytoy> Hey all. Is there a way to get an event if the markup has been changed somehow?
[07:29:10] <squeakytoy> or if a certain element's inner html has been changed?
[07:33:18] <k_sze> I don't quite get how to use jquery ui from CDNs
[07:33:43] <k_sze> e.g. I want to use the one hosted at cdnjs.com
[07:33:52] <k_sze> but dear lord there are *many* css files.
[07:34:30] <k_sze> Meanwhile, Google's CDN doesn't have any of the theme files. :/
[07:34:36] <k_sze> just the javascript
[07:35:04] <Cthdral__> would someone would be able to direct me to learn about how to print out each filename on a separate line from an HTML5 multiple file upload? The Google Gods are not generous today
[07:35:58] <[deedee]> hm i just implemented some mouseover effects on my website, but now i noticed, loading the pictures take too long, so i need to wait placing my mouse over the piture for 3-4 secs before it works
[07:36:01] <[deedee]> http://pastebin.com/Y8VLxvqS
[07:36:21] <[deedee]> i'm new to js/jquery - any suggestions how i can speed it up?
[07:36:26] <Cthdral__> [deedee] have you 'web optimized' them?
[07:36:30] <BillCriswell> k_sze: There's this: http://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jqueryui/1.10.3/css/base/jquery.ui.all.min.css
[07:37:05] <Cthdral__> any images I have online normally fall between the 50kb-80kb area so they'll load faster
[07:37:10] <[deedee]> Cthdral__: what do you exactly mean by that? ok they have a size of ~200k each, but that should be still fine?
[07:37:38] <[deedee]> 200kb each png
[07:37:49] <[deedee]> +/- 50kb
[07:38:11] <Cthdral__> [deedee] yea I normally open them up in photoshop and do 'Save for web'. Also, make sure they 'Have' to be png's. I only use png's when I need a transparent background. jpg has a better compression
[07:38:23] <Cthdral__> when all else fails, you could always preload them with good 'ol javascript
[07:38:58] <[deedee]> hm k i'll try that, thx
[07:39:01] <Cthdral__> np
[07:39:41] <Cthdral__> would anyone know how I could access the file array inside of the html5 multiple file tag?
[07:40:19] <[deedee]> hm i just noticed they only have a size between 70-150kb so i have to use preloading ;/
[07:40:21] <k_sze> BillCriswell: yeah, and then there's this: https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jqueryui/1.10.3/css/base/jquery-ui.css
[07:40:26] <k_sze> very confusing
[07:40:58] <Cthdral__> [deedee] That would probably be a good place to start. Then if you're still experiencing lag, you could try to compress them some more
[07:42:57] <BillCriswell> k_sze: That appears to just be the base, in the event you want to pick and choose which pieces you want to install.
[07:44:38] <DarsVaeda> I try to set a background image to a <header> element in IE8 it works in any other but not here
[07:44:47] <DarsVaeda> do I have to expect it?
[07:45:08] <shoky> k_sze: BillCriswell: nah the 2nd link is better
[07:45:20] <DarsVaeda> it sets it but does not display btw
[07:45:36] <BillCriswell> DarsVaeda:HTML5 shim?
[07:45:39] <shoky> except for the https://
[07:45:45] <DarsVaeda> BillCriswell, have it
[07:45:57] <DarsVaeda> ah wait I just have an idea
[07:46:20] <BillCriswell> shoky: Does that one include everything? It seems to only be the base styles.
[07:46:32] <shoky> BillCriswell: i think so
[07:47:17] <shoky> oh hm
[07:48:23] <shoky> ya seems good
[07:48:56] <DarsVaeda> ah too bad it didn't work :(
[07:50:00] <BillCriswell> shoky: Ha, duh. Says "includes: gigantic, list, of, things" in the header comment.
[07:50:21] <BillCriswell> It seems a little light weight for everything.
[07:50:22] <Tee_Pee> heya guys, quick question
[07:50:51] <shoky> jquery-ui stuff all looks the same ;p
[07:51:12] <Tee_Pee> I am trying to do the following - on every page change, check if the sessionStorage has a certain object, and if it doesn't, redirect to a different screen.
[07:51:27] <BillCriswell> all that cascading going on and everything.
[07:51:38] <Tee_Pee> I registered this in pagebeforeshow, but whenever the condition is met, the destination page flickers into view for half a second before the redirection happens
[07:52:21] <Tee_Pee> Sorry, I keep forgetting about the cascade rule, don't frequent this channel too much. It's kind of difficult to explain what it is I'm having trouble with.
[07:53:17] <Tee_Pee> Basically, if the user wants to go to screen A, the pagebeforeshow determines that it needs to redirect to screen B rather than A, I do a changePage, but A still appears for a second before switching to B. I want that to stop and B showing up directly.
[07:53:19] <Bloomberg> Morning guys!!
[07:53:44] <Bloomberg> How can I add some property like data-id to tag dinamically?
[07:53:58] <Bloomberg> some like .addclass()
[07:54:02] <Bloomberg> But with more properties
[07:54:24] <JackBauer24> Bloomberg: .data("id", "abc")
[07:54:42] <BillCriswell> Bloomberg: .attr() if you want the attribute, you can just do .data() if you don't need the attribute.
[07:55:05] <BillCriswell> Better off just using data() probably. Disregard the last thing I said.
[07:55:24] <Bloomberg> Thanks guys!!
[07:56:01] <ppppp_> Do any of y'all use brackets as an editor?
[07:57:16] <jedimind> y'all
[07:57:17] <jedimind> really ?
[07:58:08] <BillCriswell> I'm teaching myself angular... somethings happen so naturally while others I'm just scratching my head.
[07:58:18] <jedimind> BillCriswell ditto
[07:58:34] <jedimind> im assuming you went through egghead.io ?
[07:58:47] <WebDragon> vote gvim for editor!
[07:58:52] <WebDragon> xD
[07:59:57] <BillCriswell> jedimind: Just reading through the angular site. Recommend egghead.io?
[08:00:02] <ppppp_> y'all
[08:00:05] <ppppp_> really.
[08:00:09] <jedimind> BillCriswell yeah http://egghead.io/lessons
[08:00:13] <jedimind> scroll to the bottom and work your way up
[08:00:27] <jedimind> really concise, 3-5 minute lessons, really good
[08:01:56] <BillCriswell> I'll have to look through these.
[08:02:48] <WebDragon> http://alexyoung.org/2006/10/22/vim-for-textmate-fans/
[08:03:37] <jedimind> BillCriswell it really helped me to go through them in sequence even though i "knew" some of the basics, it helped to have him go through it step by step
[08:03:41] <jedimind> it progresses nicely
[08:03:53] <WebDragon> MVC web development lessons ?
[08:05:15] <BillCriswell> WebDragon: Angular.js. The site explains it better than I ever could haha: http://angularjs.org/
[08:05:31] <WebDragon> yeah I was just going over to look at that
[08:08:34] <andrew9183> egghead is awesome :)
[08:09:18] <marl_scot> hi folks, im trying to find a way to serialize my check boxes in a form when it is submitted, i have several input fields and check boxes, but need the check boxes to be combined into a string on submission (ether serialized or csv) anyone got any hints?
[08:09:40] <jedimind> waddup andrew9183
[08:09:45] <andrew9183> hey jedimind
[08:09:46] <BillCriswell> marl_scot: Just the checkboxes or the whole form?
[08:10:02] <marl_scot> just need the check boxes
[08:10:14] <BillCriswell> marl_scot: Either way, you should look into .serialize() and .serializeArray()
[08:11:58] <marl_scot> something like : var chk=$('.mycheckclass').serializeArray(); ?
[08:12:15] <BillCriswell> marl_scot: Yes. Seems about right.
[08:13:43] <marl_scot> can you use the same id on mutliple checkboxes? (instead of using classes)
[08:13:58] <BillCriswell> marl_scot: No.
[08:14:22] <Bloomberg> Guys !!
[08:14:34] <Bloomberg> Can I to do an array for set properties?
[08:14:40] <Cthdral__> need some help. I've figured out my question, but now I'm trying to get it to cancel certain images, but I can't even get the click event to register: http://jsfiddle.net/Rd47m/
[08:15:10] <Bloomberg> like  ::: $("#Something").attr({'data-id':1, 'data-where':some});
[08:15:13] <Bloomberg> like this?
[08:15:53] <BillCriswell> Bloomberg: If you tried that you would see it works.=)
[08:16:26] <BillCriswell> Bloomberg: Should be using data though. .data({ id: 1, where: some });
[08:17:20] <Bloomberg> Wroks ok !!
[08:17:24] <Bloomberg> works*
[08:18:35] <BillCriswell> jsbin just had me thinking I was crazy.
[08:18:50] <BillCriswell> http://jsbin.com/IRuxili/1/edit are those checkboxes not checked for anyone else?
[08:19:20] <Cthdral__> I have 'em checked
[08:19:47] <BillCriswell> Cthdral__: Haha, so weird.
[08:19:49] <marl_scot> ok, got the following, but am not getting anything logged and dont seem to be ataching to the submit button :( http://jsfiddle.net/marl_scot/X38jZ/
[08:20:58] <Cthdral__> can anyone take a look? http://jsfiddle.net/Rd47m/, I'm trying to remove some elements, but the click event isn't registering
[08:21:48] <BillCriswell> marl_scot: http://jsfiddle.net/X38jZ/1/
[08:22:41] <riseman> hi guys
[08:22:55] <BillCriswell> Cthdral__: You can't attach to something before it's created.
[08:23:10] <riseman> any idea on what am i doing wrong here? http://jsfiddle.net/Sakvf/ it always seems to skip one photo at the beginning and one at the end when coming back
[08:24:06] <Cthdral__> BillCriswell: the only time I'm trying to attach would be after it's created...to test to see if it exists first? i.e. if ($(".cancel_image").length > 0) ?
[08:24:58] <Cthdral__> scratch that
[08:25:17] <marl_scot> lol, thanks BillCriswell think i had been looking at the code for too long, stupid mistake
[08:26:06] <BillCriswell> Cthdral__: I would listen for events on a parent element. Let's just say "body" but something closer would help, you can then do $('body').on('click', '.not-created-yet', doWhatever);
[08:26:19] <BillCriswell> Cthdral__: http://jsfiddle.net/Rd47m/1/ Like this.
[08:27:00] <BillCriswell> Listen for clicks on the body and see which element initiated that event.***
[08:27:21] <BillCriswell> marl_scot: No problem!
[08:27:51] <Cthdral__> ahhh. Very well, thanks for the direction. I figured it had something to do with scope / existence. When you delve for so long into backend coding, you forget the usual front-end tricks!
[08:28:43] <BillCriswell> Cthdral__: Totally understood!
[08:33:57] <marl_scot> I HATE JAVASCRIPT :( what have i done wrong with this? http://jsfiddle.net/marl_scot/X38jZ/3/ all im trying to do is assign the serialized array to a var so i can inject it into the form before submitting it, now its not binding again
[08:34:49] <marl_scot> is there anything out there that allows you to step line by line and shows things like binddings etc? jsfiddle with a line by line step?
[08:35:27] <shoky> marl_scot: Uncaught ReferenceError: $arr is not defined
[08:36:47] <marl_scot> i'm loosing FAR to much hair with this :( thanks shoky
[08:37:20] <shoky> marl_scot: and yes of course there is such a thing, your browser's devtools debugger

[08:40:29] <shoky> bberry: map, not grep
[08:40:42] <shoky> grep is for filtering
[08:40:48] <shoky> map is for transforming

[08:53:29] <clh> hi folks, I've been working with JQM for a number of years and now have a large app that needs to be built.  can someone point me to some blogs/books/other resources that discuss how to architect a large app?
[08:54:33] <clh> I'm mainly thinking of how to keep things DRY, as performant as possible, and maintainable by other folks
[08:56:11] <Rohan_Bhangui> dougguys got an issue
[08:56:12] <Rohan_Bhangui> http://jsfiddle.net/rohanbhangui/8kwSE/
[08:56:33] <NoiseEee> clh: tbh, you should probably look into frameworks
[08:56:34] <Rohan_Bhangui> *guys
[08:56:44] <Rohan_Bhangui> my problem
[08:56:47] <NoiseEee> clh: like angular, ember, or backbone
[08:56:49] <Rohan_Bhangui> is that the marquee
[08:56:54] <Rohan_Bhangui> wont start dunnno whats wrong
[08:57:25] <Rohan_Bhangui> http://jsfiddle.net/rohanbhangui/8kwSE/1/
[08:57:41] <Rohan_Bhangui> i am programmatically adding the animation using keyframes take a look ^
[08:57:54] <clh> NoiseEee: thx .. I did some prototyping with backbone and seemed to be a decent way to go, but I've also been looking at angular, though haven't coded anything with it yet
[08:58:32] <NoiseEee> clh: its a tough call on which to choose, read around and see what others think, try out the demos of each
[08:58:50] <Rohan_Bhangui> nvm
[08:58:51] <Rohan_Bhangui> solved
[08:58:53] <NoiseEee> clh: i'd probably take angular or ember over backbone though these days when startin out
[08:58:55] <clh> NoiseEee: I liked backbone, but see that angular is getting a lot of google love
[08:59:18] <clh> NoiseEee: looks like they are using it and contributing to it
[08:59:26] <NoiseEee> clh: yes its theirs, it was invented there
[08:59:43] <clh> NoiseEee: ah, I thought it was document cloud or something
[08:59:50] <NoiseEee> thats backbone
[09:00:12] <jedimind> even ember is dying off slowly
[09:00:15] <jedimind> angular seems to be have won
[09:00:19] <NoiseEee> clh: either way it'll be a learning curve
[09:00:21] <Gho5t> noice
[09:00:28] <Gho5t> somehow I always get lucky
[09:00:31] <Gho5t> I went with Angular
[09:00:57] <Gho5t> of course being backed by google is usually a good indicator of success
[09:01:06] <Gho5t> although whatever happened to Dart
[09:01:07] <clh> Gho5t: have you been happy with angular?
[09:01:16] <Gho5t> clh: yes very much so
[09:01:49] <clh> Gho5t: did you have any issues working out nav / routing?
[09:02:03] <Gho5t> no not really
[09:02:23] <NoiseEee> clh: its pretty straightahead, but there is definitely a learning curve, and more than that, a shift in thinking how you design apps / architecture apps
[09:02:26] <clh> Gho5t: were you able to break up your JQM pages into separate files?
[09:02:38] <Rohan_Bhangui> okay run into issues again
[09:02:39] <Gho5t> i didn't use JQM
[09:02:42] <Rohan_Bhangui> aniation not working
[09:02:45] <Rohan_Bhangui> animation
[09:02:45] <Gho5t> I just used angular
[09:02:54] <Gho5t> anguarl supports transitions now
[09:02:54] <Rohan_Bhangui> http://jsfiddle.net/rohanbhangui/8kwSE/2/
[09:03:00] <Rohan_Bhangui> any assist would be great
[09:03:06] <Gho5t> I don't know why everyone insists on using jqm for mobile apps
[09:03:09] <Gho5t> you don't need it
[09:03:20] <clh> Gho5t: interesting .. what did you use for themeing?
[09:03:26] <NoiseEee> also, angular works well with twitter bootstrap
[09:03:27] <Gho5t> bootstrap
[09:04:42] <clh> Gho5t: ok, thanks.  maybe I should rethink.  I was glad to see the changes in JQM 1.4 beta which had me leaning that way.
[09:06:09] <jop008> when I inject html in a div element the div element is behind other divs and doesn't push the other elements down
[09:06:12] <shoky> bberry no it doesn't change the original array
[09:06:22] <jop008> must I do a page  create?
[09:07:12] <NoiseEee> jop008: position it correctly in the DOM / use CSS?
[09:10:27] <jop008> this is teh layout http://picpaste.com/upload.php
[09:10:37] <soahccc> I can't remember the name and can't find it :( Which plugin provides stuff to annotate resp. make a tutorial on a live page?
[09:10:39] <jop008> So the div is behind othere elements of the page
[09:10:48] <Gho5t> so set the z-index
[09:11:02] <Gho5t> first question 1) why is it behind other divs
[09:11:09] <Gho5t> second question, how do you undo that
[09:15:09] <MrPunkin> Hey folks. I'm trying to diagnose .on() performance issues on a few buttons. I have tried binding to the parent container, to the individual a elements, and everywhere in-between but it is crazy slow. However, the same on() binding and handler is assigned to another set of links that performs just fine.
[09:15:17] <MrPunkin> so I know it's not my event handling function or anything
[09:18:04] <jop008> So how to refresh this http://picpaste.com/upload.php
[09:18:21] <jop008> the div is behind other elements
[09:19:02] <BillCriswell> MrPunkin: Have anything to look at?
[09:19:44] <MrPunkin> BillCriswell: Yeah, one moment.
[09:20:04] <NoiseEee> jop008: which part of Gho5t's answer didn't you read.  set the z-index
[09:20:48] <jop008> z-index missed
[09:22:08] <jop008> z-index to what?
[09:22:26] <jop008> the other fields must be pushed down
[09:22:41] <jop008> http://picpaste.com/upload.php
[09:24:24] <Gho5t> why is it behind the other divs
[09:24:37] <MrPunkin> BillCriswell: http://capturedemo.s3.amazonaws.com/promo/time-art.html
[09:24:40] <NoiseEee> jop008: then its a CSS issue?  what do you mean "behind"?
[09:25:00] <jop008> Like the picture I show you
[09:25:02] <MrPunkin> BillCriswell: we don't actually have any affiliation with time. This is just an internal test injecting our widget into a larger DOM similar to where it will be used.
[09:25:05] <jop008> showed you
[09:25:08] <MrPunkin> BillCriswell: wait for the widget to load in the article
[09:25:20] <mortal1> howdy folks, I need to break IE's ajax caching, and I can't use cache : false, are there any other means of doing so?
[09:25:36] <mortal1> I tried to set the headers of the request to that recommended by ms
[09:25:36] <MrPunkin> mortal1: custom query strings?
[09:25:54] <MrPunkin> mortal1: or is that what cache:false does?
[09:25:56] <mortal1> MrPunkin: my api tries to consume it, and pukes
[09:26:02] <jop008> solved it was the css of the element
[09:26:16] <mortal1> ...i should say, it's not *my* api
[09:26:32] <MrPunkin> mortal1: so you can't pass anything additional because it interfaces with a strict API
[09:26:42] <mortal1> MrPunkin: you got it
[09:27:27] <MrPunkin> mortal1: and which headers specifically did you set?
[09:29:02] <Rohan_Bhangui> can i use a fucntion and iterative

[09:29:10] <Rohan_Bhangui> i can produce
[09:29:20] <Rohan_Bhangui> variables
[09:29:21] <Rohan_Bhangui> like
[09:29:23] <aFeijo> hey folks, I use a countdown script that I've wrote many years ago. But to long countdowns (of hours), if the page stay open for many minutes, the countdown get wrong, delayed. So it should be based on the end date, not how many seconds to reduce.  Those such plugin exists?
[09:29:29] <Rohan_Bhangui> $("foo"+i)
[09:29:33] <aFeijo> *Does such plugin...
[09:29:34] <Rohan_Bhangui> where i is integer
[09:30:16] <MrPunkin> Rohan_Bhangui: If you want the variable assigned to window or another object you could by using the syntax window["foo"+i] = blah;
[09:30:26] <Rohan_Bhangui> true
[09:30:38] <Rohan_Bhangui> but i need it more for css3
[09:30:39] <MrPunkin> Rohan_Bhangui: or you could create an object to hold them such as var v = {}; then do v["name"+i]
[09:30:41] <Rohan_Bhangui> animation variables
[09:30:48] <MrPunkin> Rohan_Bhangui: code?
[09:30:58] <Rohan_Bhangui> ill give you sudo
[09:31:22] <aFeijo> yay, I just found out this interesting site www.countdownjs.org

[09:34:21] <Rohan_Bhangui> *mouse down
[09:34:37] <MrPunkin> Rohan_Bhangui: Why would it be fine on my thumbs but not the arrows?
[09:34:48] <MrPunkin> Rohan_Bhangui: its an inconsistency, not just wanting faster all around
[09:34:51] <Rohan_Bhangui> wait this is a touch application?
[09:34:56] <MrPunkin> Rohan_Bhangui: no
[09:35:17] <Rohan_Bhangui> what i mean by that is
[09:35:22] <Rohan_Bhangui> are you using touch
[09:35:25] <MrPunkin> no
[09:35:28] <Rohan_Bhangui> to do interaction or mouse
[09:35:30] <Rohan_Bhangui> okay
[09:35:31] <Rohan_Bhangui> mouse
[09:35:33] <Rohan_Bhangui> mhmmmm
[09:36:09] <MrPunkin> I tried assigning one on to the parent with the filters in place, as well as directly assigning the .on() function to each button, with no difference really.
[09:36:17] <MrPunkin> however the thumbnails calling the same function work just fine
[09:36:19] <MrPunkin> as expected
[09:36:32] <Rohan_Bhangui> remember thumbnails are not same
[09:36:34] <Rohan_Bhangui> image
[09:36:41] <Rohan_Bhangui> check whether two sets on images are bein used
[09:36:46] <MrPunkin> Rohan_Bhangui: I have the thumbs action assigned to the wrapping a
[09:36:53] <Rohan_Bhangui> k
[09:37:20] <Rohan_Bhangui> dunno
[09:37:34] <Rohan_Bhangui> you have a solution for my issue
[09:37:39] <MrPunkin> Thanks though. On your code is the prefixes what you are trying?
[09:37:45] <Rohan_Bhangui> well
[09:37:48] <Rohan_Bhangui> here is the thing
[09:37:50] <Rohan_Bhangui> my marquee
[09:37:59] <Rohan_Bhangui> is dependant on the width of the -content divs
[09:38:01] <Rohan_Bhangui> so
[09:38:05] <Rohan_Bhangui> the issue arrises
[09:38:10] <Rohan_Bhangui> cause the marquee animation
[09:38:19] <Rohan_Bhangui> requires 2 seperate
[09:38:21] <Rohan_Bhangui> marquee
[09:38:23] <Rohan_Bhangui> animations
[09:38:25] <LoneSoldier728> anyone here work
[09:38:25] <Rohan_Bhangui> so i give 2 names
[09:38:26] <LoneSoldier728> with lucene
[09:38:31] <LoneSoldier728> before or a similar search system?

[09:39:28] <Rohan_Bhangui> i need to be able to create variables on the fly
[09:40:16] <MrPunkin> Rohan_Bhangui: can you show me the variable in here that needs created on the fly? Or do you not have it coded yet?
[09:40:18] <MrPunkin> in any attempt?
[09:40:26] <Rohan_Bhangui> its there
[09:40:28] <Rohan_Bhangui> aniamte
[09:40:30] <Rohan_Bhangui> *animate
[09:40:33] <Rohan_Bhangui> cause
[09:40:38] <Rohan_Bhangui> the css notation
[09:40:46] <Rohan_Bhangui> is @keyframes [variable] ......
[09:41:05] <Rohan_Bhangui> so the actually actual animation
[09:41:09] <Rohan_Bhangui> var
[09:41:14] <Rohan_Bhangui> is what i need to hcange on the fly
[09:42:17] <MrPunkin> Rohan_Bhangui: I'm not seeing why you need a dynamic variable name here from this code, rather than just dynamically setting the CSS text and moving on.
[09:42:27] <MrPunkin> Rohan_Bhangui: you need to reference this in JS by the dynamic name again later?
[09:42:38] <Rohan_Bhangui> i guess
[09:42:42] <Rohan_Bhangui> ohld i think
[09:42:46] <Rohan_Bhangui> i might have foudn something
[09:43:27] <MrPunkin> right now your keyframe rules is being set to @prefixkeyframemarqueen
[09:43:30] <MrPunkin> since you don't have any spaces
[09:43:32] <MrPunkin> is that desired?
[09:43:41] <Rohan_Bhangui> MrPunkin: http://jsfiddle.net/rohanbhangui/8kwSE/5/
[09:43:42] <Rohan_Bhangui> i updated
[09:43:48] <Rohan_Bhangui> decided to ad second parameter
[09:43:51] <Rohan_Bhangui> still doesnt work
[09:44:06] <Rohan_Bhangui> no it is not desired
[09:44:31] <MrPunkin> have you output the actual CSS this is creating?
[09:45:28] <Rohan_Bhangui> nope
[09:45:28] <Rohan_Bhangui> trying now
[09:45:55] <Rohan_Bhangui> out put looks fine
[09:45:57] <Rohan_Bhangui> to me
[09:46:17] <MrPunkin> Rohan_Bhangui: also, its not adding to the head of my document, which could be part of the problem.
[09:46:25] <MrPunkin> Rohan_Bhangui: $('head') returns null
[09:46:30] <Rohan_Bhangui> hmmmmm
[09:46:32] <Rohan_Bhangui> interesting
[09:46:35] <Rohan_Bhangui> cause it worked before
[09:46:38] <MrPunkin> wait, that could just be on jsfiddle
[09:46:40] <Rohan_Bhangui> in like revision 3
[09:48:07] <MrPunkin> Rohan_Bhangui: Okay, so you are creating two sets of keyframes marquee1 and marquee2
[09:48:14] <Rohan_Bhangui> yeah
[09:48:20] <MrPunkin> however your .marquee class still references the base animation named 'marquee'
[09:48:20] <Rohan_Bhangui> and both have different
[09:48:21] <MrPunkin> right?
[09:48:22] <Rohan_Bhangui> properties
[09:48:27] <Rohan_Bhangui> true
[09:48:29] <MrPunkin> so nothing is going to actually run
[09:48:31] <Rohan_Bhangui> thats hwat i need to change
[09:48:33] <MrPunkin> these new animations
[09:48:37] <Rohan_Bhangui> and it wont allow me to do that
[09:48:46] <MrPunkin> just create a new class along with this css
[09:48:49] <MrPunkin> called .marqueeN
[09:48:52] <MrPunkin> for each animation
[09:48:54] <MrPunkin> that calls that animation
[09:49:02] <MrPunkin> and inherits the rest of the normal marquee
[09:49:38] <Rohan_Bhangui> http://jsfiddle.net/rohanbhangui/8kwSE/7/
[09:50:44] <Rohan_Bhangui> http://jsfiddle.net/rohanbhangui/8kwSE/8/
[09:50:52] <Rohan_Bhangui> it seems there is an issue with the class making
[09:51:39] <Rohan_Bhangui> it seems there is an issue with the class making
[09:51:43] <Rohan_Bhangui> any ideas?
[09:52:23] <duch_kazatel> "the class making"?
[09:52:24] <MrPunkin> Rohan_Bhangui: http://jsfiddle.net/8kwSE/9/
[09:52:26] <MrPunkin> works for me
[09:52:42] <MrPunkin> however it doesn't take into account which class should be added and why
[09:52:44] <MrPunkin> based on width
[09:53:20] <Rohan_Bhangui> OH YA
[09:53:25] <Rohan_Bhangui> that might be an issue
[09:53:27] <MrPunkin> and the CSS is actually wrong too as it is creating the class X times
[09:53:32] <Rohan_Bhangui> but the real
[09:53:34] <Rohan_Bhangui> quesiton is
[09:53:41] <Rohan_Bhangui> will the speed
[09:53:44] <Rohan_Bhangui> scroll at the same time
[09:53:52] <Rohan_Bhangui> no matter the size of the text
[09:54:22] <MrPunkin> Rohan_Bhangui: hold one
[09:54:23] <MrPunkin> on
[09:54:24] <MrPunkin> one second
[09:54:33] <Rohan_Bhangui> kk
[09:54:35] <Rohan_Bhangui> i think it will
[09:54:38] <Rohan_Bhangui> but im just check
[09:54:57] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol thats bad
[09:55:01] <Rohan_Bhangui> both end at same time
[09:55:04] <Rohan_Bhangui> i need them to run
[09:55:33] <Rohan_Bhangui> independant of each other
[09:57:48] <MrPunkin> Rohan_Bhangui: http://jsfiddle.net/8kwSE/10/
[09:58:56] <Rohan_Bhangui> okay thats great
[09:59:03] <Rohan_Bhangui> just a small tiny weeny
[09:59:05] <Rohan_Bhangui> question
[09:59:13] <Rohan_Bhangui> is it possible for them to scroll at same speed
[09:59:41] <Rohan_Bhangui> MrPunkin: cause i want to try and do that to ensure readability
[10:05:11] <dieguezz> (j javascript
[10:07:59] <MrPunkin> Rohan_Bhangui: If you want them to scroll at the same speed go back to using the same animation on both, right? They were scrolling at the same speed before I fixed the issues of assigning the same class to each
[10:08:18] <Rohan_Bhangui> okay
[10:08:41] <Rohan_Bhangui> ya main issue
[10:08:45] <Rohan_Bhangui> is when the shorter one finishes
[10:08:51] <Rohan_Bhangui> the longer one restarts as well
[10:08:58] <Rohan_Bhangui> so i need animations idependant of each other
[10:09:07] <Rohan_Bhangui> check version 9
[10:09:18] <Rohan_Bhangui> http://jsfiddle.net/8kwSE/9/
[10:14:09] <Rohan_Bhangui> any ideas?
[10:15:01] <MrPunkin> Rohan_Bhangui: the problem is you set the time each animation takes at a set 15s, no matter the width. You could achieve the same affect as this right now by using -100% width for the 100% keyframe rather than the negative width in pixels, right?
[10:15:16] <Rohan_Bhangui> i guess
[10:15:19] <MrPunkin> Rohan_Bhangui: what you should be changing is the time it takes to run as a percentage of the width, which would be harder to figure out
[10:15:32] <Rohan_Bhangui> ya i am aware of that
[10:15:43] <Rohan_Bhangui> i jsut want them to scroll independant of each other is there no way to do this
[10:16:33] <MrPunkin> Rohan_Bhangui: independent of each other but same speed?
[10:16:45] <Rohan_Bhangui> yes
[10:28:19] <TheArtofBalance_> Hey Jquery, I'm having an issue I was hoping to get some assistance with. I'm building a header for a website and Id like it to be fixed at the top of the screen. I'd also like for it to shrink on scroll to save screen real-estate, and have everything inside it shrink as well. Ive created a basic example on jsfiddle but I cannot get it working properly. Any Ideas? http://jsfiddle.net/L4Gvx/
[10:29:00] <MrPunkin> Rohan_Bhangui: checking something
[10:29:08] <Rohan_Bhangui> kk
[10:29:41] <Rohan_Bhangui> TheArtofBalance_: use scrolltop
[10:29:52] <Rohan_Bhangui> `api scrollTop TheArtofBalance_
[10:30:54] <TheArtofBalance_> Im new to jquery, can you point me in the direction of an example usage?
[10:31:05] <Rohan_Bhangui> `api scrolTop @TheArtofBalance_
[10:31:05] <b-ot> TheArtofBalance_: No matches.
[10:31:11] <Rohan_Bhangui> kk
[10:31:12] <Rohan_Bhangui> um
[10:31:15] <Rohan_Bhangui> let me see
[10:31:52] <TheArtofBalance_> I fiddle is working, I forgot to set the framework to the latest version of jquery, that said the header is shrinking but nothing inside it is.
[10:31:54] <MrPunkin> Rohan_Bhangui: Does setting just a single animation with a single speed not get them close enough for you? It seems they are nearly identical speed (though not exact)
[10:32:06] <Rohan_Bhangui> TheArtofBalance_: i see you have alrady used that
[10:32:08] <Rohan_Bhangui> hmm
[10:32:11] <Rohan_Bhangui> i would suggest
[10:32:19] <Rohan_Bhangui> you remove fixed elemnt
[10:32:30] <Rohan_Bhangui> and only make it fixed once scrolling is greater than 0
[10:32:44] <MrPunkin> Rohan_Bhangui: actually it does the exact
[10:32:45] <MrPunkin> here..
[10:33:14] <TheArtofBalance_> yes the fixed position is to keep it stuck at the top.
[10:33:18] <Rohan_Bhangui> MrPunkin: i know its a pain but i need them to scroll at same speed and finish completely no matter the length
[10:33:30] <MrPunkin> http://jsfiddle.net/8kwSE/11/
[10:34:03] <MrPunkin> Rohan_Bhangui: http://jsfiddle.net/8kwSE/12/
[10:34:19] <Rohan_Bhangui> TheArtofBalance_: this is like a hack but you could have 2 headers and then turn one or the other on
[10:34:25] <Rohan_Bhangui> when scrolling occurs
[10:34:32] <MrPunkin> Rohan_Bhangui: your problem then is that X seconds is too long for one, and may be too short for another?
[10:34:38] <TheArtofBalance_> I had considered that.
[10:34:45] <Rohan_Bhangui> MrPunkin: yeah
[10:35:01] <Rohan_Bhangui> MrPunkin: watch the animation it gets cut off
[10:35:07] <MrPunkin> yeah
[10:35:36] <jedimind> <marquee>
[10:35:56] <Rohan_Bhangui> jedimind: which age are you in....that was deprecated....and i tried that its laggy
[10:35:59] <duch_kazatel> woah
[10:36:01] <Rohan_Bhangui> i need it to be smooth
[10:36:19] <jedimind> its still supported by most browsers
[10:36:27] <jedimind> holy shit its laggy though
[10:36:50] <bberry> can i add properties to DOM objects? like can i do $("#divname").type = "foo"?
[10:37:13] <bberry> And if so, when i use .sortable from jquery UI, when i move the object from one list to the other, will it retain that information
[10:37:15] <duch_kazatel> bberry no, but you can store them in data.
[10:37:27] <bberry> hmm oaky
[10:37:29] <duch_kazatel> or in attributes.
[10:37:49] <bberry> so like $("#divname").data = "foo"?
[10:38:00] <duch_kazatel> http://api.jquery.com/data/
[10:38:15] <duch_kazatel> $('#divname').data('foo', 'bar')
[10:38:30] <bberry> hmm nice
[10:38:53] <bberry> do you think the data attribute will stay using sortable from jquery ui
[10:39:30] <duch_kazatel> it should.
[10:39:44] <bberry> im not sure how they implement the drag and drop. like im not sure if they remove the DOM element and then add it back, or if they detach
[10:39:48] <bberry> i would assume detach
[10:39:50] <bberry> we'll see :D
[10:44:24] <Rohan_Bhangui> jedimind or MrPunkin any ideas?
[10:45:08] <duch_kazatel> Rohan_Bhangui you want both to start and complete at the same time, right?
[10:45:25] <MrPunkin> Rohan_Bhangui: it should be simple math to take the width of the container, width of the scroller, and figure out a factor to multiply by in order that each moves at the same speed.
[10:45:28] <duch_kazatel> if so, you'll have to calculate the speed of the scrool
[10:45:33] <Rohan_Bhangui> no
[10:45:33] <Rohan_Bhangui> i want same speed
[10:45:34] <Rohan_Bhangui> i dont mind when they start and finish
[10:45:52] <Rohan_Bhangui> well here is how i figured it
[10:45:56] <Rohan_Bhangui> at a certain lenght say
[10:45:58] <Rohan_Bhangui> 2000px
[10:46:06] <Rohan_Bhangui> if 20s animation is perfect
[10:46:08] <Rohan_Bhangui> next time
[10:46:23] <Rohan_Bhangui> i just do ( width*20s)/2000px
[10:46:26] <Rohan_Bhangui> to get seconds
[10:46:30] <Rohan_Bhangui> here is my issue
[10:46:35] <Rohan_Bhangui> how to get them to start
[10:46:41] <Rohan_Bhangui> and have smae scroll speed
[10:46:49] <Rohan_Bhangui> and not be dependant on each other
[10:47:35] <duch_kazatel> aaaah.

[11:11:27] <Drabla> Hi guys. Doing a $.post ( http://pastebin.com/1djwykXc )  but it only executes properly when i add an additional line below the $.post. Any ideas? (php part works, vars are correct)
[11:12:10] <NoiseEee> `php @ Drabla
[11:12:11] <b-ot> Drabla: <? $a = "2d9"; $a++; $a++; print $a;
[11:12:15] <NoiseEee> lol
[11:12:29] <NoiseEee> Drabla: show us the rendered source, not php
[11:12:40] <duch_kazatel> yeah what's the html.
[11:12:56] <Drabla> html : <?=anchor('home/ort', 'L√∂schen', 'class="delC" name="'.$row->ortID.'" cat="2" u="'.$row->ortUserID.'"')?>
[11:13:10] <duch_kazatel> that's not html.
[11:13:26] <bigbugjava> NoiseEee Same issue mate
[11:13:37] <Drabla> <a href="http://notgonnatel.com/index.php/home/ort" class="delC" name="14" cat="2" u="1">L√∂schen</a>
[11:13:49] <NoiseEee> bigbugjava: recreate a jsfiddle
[11:13:51] <bigbugjava> NoiseEee http://jsfiddle.net/h6nGd/1/ if ya can take a look
[11:15:04] <Drabla> The wierd thing is that it executes as it should if i add an  alert("whatever"); below the $.post(...); line
[11:16:04] <duch_kazatel> Drabla redo the paste with full html please.
[11:16:06] <duch_kazatel> no php
[11:16:08] <bigbugjava> NoiseEee tried, change,toggle nada
[11:16:35] <Drabla> k. sec
[11:16:38] <duch_kazatel> bigbugjava can you get a working fiddle up with some html?
[11:16:52] <duch_kazatel> oh, bigbugjava try the "change" event instead of "click"
[11:16:53] <NoiseEee> http://jsfiddle.net/h6nGd/2/ @ bigbugjava
[11:17:36] <bigbugjava> I see it works perfect, dunno why on my ship it doens't
[11:17:38] <bigbugjava> sec adding htm
[11:17:39] <bigbugjava> l
[11:18:14] <bigbugjava> the thing is.. it's a 2 big code for jsfiddle
[11:18:29] <bigbugjava> I add the input like this : input.setAttribute('type', 'checkbox');
[11:18:49] <bigbugjava> it's a dynamic table.. with checkboxs
[11:18:50] <NoiseEee> bigbugjava: first off i don't understand why thats in a function
[11:19:05] <bigbugjava> I have to
[11:19:09] <NoiseEee> bigbugjava: if the table is being rendered after load/JS, then you need to do something like:
[11:19:36] <NoiseEee> $(parentOfTableThatIsAlwaysPresent).on('click','input[type="checkbox"]',function() { alert('hey now'); })
[11:19:57] <bigbugjava> whattt.. lets check it out
[11:21:50] <Drabla> Here is the complete source: http://pastebin.com/Yf7rWb1C
[11:21:51] <bigbugjava> why it's only the first click, omg
[11:24:54] <marl_scot> ok, im confused, i thought that 'serializeArray' would convert an array to a text format, but it doesnt seem to in my tests :(
[11:26:18] <bigbugjava> marl_scot kinda turns it into an Array.. from an Object or form fields
[11:26:28] <bigbugjava> as far as I know
[11:27:04] <marl_scot> ok, so how would i convert it into a text form?
[11:27:36] <marl_scot> i get [object] when trying to output serilizaearray
[11:28:45] <Drabla> Well. seems i'm just going to leave a console.log(""); below the $.post an move on. wierd thingy ^^
[11:31:29] <duch_kazatel> Drabla that'll break in IE btw.
[11:31:37] <Woet> who cares about IE
[11:31:41] <duch_kazatel> I have to.
[11:31:56] <duch_away> money is a funny thing sometimes.  and now i eat.
[11:33:23] <Drabla> duch_kazatel it's a site for family members. none of them is using IE (wow, applefanboys save me time ;) ) - making me a note however for "later" ;>
[11:36:29] <bigbugjava> NoiseEee: if ya get ideas on that issue, run it by me, thank you for the help!
[11:44:26] <Rohan_Bhangui> MrPunkin: i figured it out i cant use nubmers im only allowed letters in animation name
[11:45:01] <MrPunkin> Rohan_Bhangui: oh yeah?
[11:45:18] <MrPunkin> is that the problem?
[11:45:24] <MrPunkin> Like you fixed it?
[11:46:21] <Drabla> Hmm. Problem was: the event happend when a link was clicked. Before the $.post was finished (not blocking) the site changed.  fixed now *yay*
[11:46:34] <sarvsav> Hello everyone.
[11:46:42] <sarvsav> I need some help with jQuery
[11:47:52] <sarvsav> I am working on a website, and i need to change the mailto: link
[11:47:59] <sarvsav> Website : http://photografrica.com/portfolio/africa-birds/#!prettyPhoto[pp_gal]/0/
[11:48:36] <MrPunkin> Rohan_Bhangui: ??
[11:48:46] <sarvsav> When someone clicks on Image, image gallery get open
[11:49:01] <Rohan_Bhangui> well you know how i was using
[11:49:08] <Rohan_Bhangui> marquee1 and marquee2
[11:49:14] <Rohan_Bhangui> and i was generating those
[11:49:36] <Rohan_Bhangui> MrPunkin: well i tried to add them into the css and they arent valid so i used letters like 'A' and 'B'
[11:49:37] <sarvsav> I want when someone click on the title of the image, the mailto, links changes to : info@photografrica.com?subject=<image-link>
[11:49:45] <sarvsav> is it possible?
[11:51:15] <MrPunkin> Rohan_Bhangui: http://jsfiddle.net/8kwSE/21/
[11:51:52] <Rohan_Bhangui> MrPunkin: i love you :)
[11:51:55] <Rohan_Bhangui> thatnks so much
[11:52:13] <MrPunkin> Rohan_Bhangui: http://jsfiddle.net/8kwSE/22/
[11:52:18] <MrPunkin> updated without console logging and with notes
[11:52:23] <Rohan_Bhangui> kk
[11:52:42] <Rohan_Bhangui> thanks so much bro
[11:52:43] <sarvsav> ...?
[11:52:44] <Rohan_Bhangui> really appreciate it
[11:52:54] <MrPunkin> Rohan_Bhangui: no problem. I knew it had to be possible
[11:52:58] <MrPunkin> I couldn't let myself not figure it out
[11:53:19] <MrPunkin> Rohan_Bhangui: another thing I had to do was update the CSS. you were missing position relative / overflow hidden on the footer wrapper
[11:53:30] <Rohan_Bhangui> ya i notied
[11:53:32] <MrPunkin> Rohan_Bhangui: Also, no need for your original marquee keyframes / class since the custom classes are on the fly
[11:53:34] <Rohan_Bhangui> noticed
[11:53:39] <Rohan_Bhangui> kk
[11:53:41] <Rohan_Bhangui> thanks
[11:53:50] <Rohan_Bhangui> quick question how will it stand up to widnow resize?
[11:53:58] <MrPunkin> Rohan_Bhangui: May want to add some of the hacks to ensure hardware acceleration as well
[11:54:11] <MrPunkin> Rohan_Bhangui: It won't as it stands
[11:54:34] <Rohan_Bhangui> okay ya i cheked it its fine
[11:54:35] <Rohan_Bhangui> thanks bro
[11:56:07] <sarvsav> I am trying this code, but its not working : http://jsfiddle.net/X4XCD/
[11:56:20] <sarvsav> could someone please help me?
[11:59:12] <Rohan_Bhangui> MrPunkin: sry i have issue
[11:59:25] <Rohan_Bhangui> http://higher.comuv.com/
[11:59:46] <Rohan_Bhangui> its moving so fast
[11:59:50] <Rohan_Bhangui> cant slow it down
[12:00:05] <MrPunkin> Rohan_Bhangui: Just change the pixels per second.
[12:00:07] <MrPunkin> variable
[12:00:10] <MrPunkin> right now its 100
[12:00:11] <Rohan_Bhangui> i tried
[12:00:21] <MrPunkin> set it to like 20
[12:00:25] <MrPunkin> works for me here
[12:00:28] <Rohan_Bhangui> refresh that link
[12:00:28] <Rohan_Bhangui> now its 10
[12:00:35] <MrPunkin> which link/
[12:01:01] <Rohan_Bhangui> http://higher.comuv.com/
[12:01:03] <Rohan_Bhangui> try it
[12:01:26] <MrPunkin> Rohan_Bhangui: it's not finishing either and the footer is off. SOmething else must be up
[12:02:05] <MrPunkin> marquee_one sets 100% at left 0px
[12:02:09] <MrPunkin> its not getting the width
[12:02:18] <MrPunkin> you waiting for DOM load and CSS on this before doing it?
[12:02:24] <MrPunkin> otherwise widths and such will be wrong
[12:04:04] <Rohan_Bhangui> kk
[12:04:06] <Rohan_Bhangui> thanks
[12:05:14] <Rohan_Bhangui> MrPunkin: what you mean by: it's not finishing either and the footer is off. SOmething else must be up
[12:05:33] <riseman> hi guys
[12:05:56] <MrPunkin> Rohan_Bhangui: I mean that the first one cuts off mid animation and the footer doesn't barely even start
[12:06:11] <Rohan_Bhangui> ya
[12:06:12] <MrPunkin> Rohan_Bhangui: they don't have proper widths being set in the head CSS generated
[12:06:13] <riseman> im pulling my hair on this one, i've been all day trying to figure out why this works: http://jsfiddle.net/Sakvf/2/ and why this version skips an img all of the time http://zonainteractivamustakis.cl/zona-interactiva/zim-grandes-modernos/
[12:06:17] <MrPunkin> Wait until window unload for this Rohan_Bhangui
[12:06:25] <Rohan_Bhangui> ?
[12:06:33] <riseman> i've tried with no css at all, different html structures, etc
[12:06:38] <riseman> doesn't make sense at all
[12:07:38] <Rohan_Bhangui> MrPunkin: cant figure out whats wrong
[12:07:44] <Rohan_Bhangui> probabl the continaers float right
[12:07:56] <MrPunkin> Rohan_Bhangui: It shouldn't be that, no.
[12:08:09] <MrPunkin> Rohan_Bhangui: can you show me the snippet of JS where this actually runs?
[12:08:31] <Rohan_Bhangui> it runs insde a $(window).on("load".....
[12:08:36] <Rohan_Bhangui> ill past the entire js
[12:08:43] <Rohan_Bhangui> i think it has to do with css
[12:08:55] <nearmiss> I've got 3 tables and want to search to find which one has td's with a certain class (this class can only ever be in one table). I tried $(table).find('.myclass') but of course that just returns me the td's.
[12:09:09] <Rohan_Bhangui> http://pastebin.com/nLkGeGqg
[12:09:12] <MrPunkin> Rohan_Bhangui: it seems to be running in $(document).ready
[12:09:18] <Rohan_Bhangui> ya
[12:09:21] <Rohan_Bhangui> is that bad?
[12:09:29] <duch_kazatel> nearmiss iterate through each table and see which one has chldren that match.
[12:09:44] <MrPunkin> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1324568/is-document-ready-also-css-ready
[12:09:48] <MrPunkin> Rohan_Bhangui: ^^
[12:09:53] <NoiseEee> nearmiss: or... $('table td.someClass') should work?
[12:10:12] <MrPunkin> Try $(window).on('load', ‚Ä¶) instead
[12:10:16] <MrPunkin> for this at least
[12:10:35] <nearmiss> duch_kazatel: ok, thought perhaps there was something without iterating through each.
[12:11:35] <Rohan_Bhangui> MrPunkin: see my pastebin link it is running sid ethat
[12:11:39] <Rohan_Bhangui> http://pastebin.com/nLkGeGqg
[12:11:50] <nullx> hello
[12:12:10] <nearmiss> NoiseEee: that still just gives me the element with that class though I think? I just want the parent table id
[12:12:34] <nearmiss> oh, I can just do closest table, I guess
[12:12:45] <duch_kazatel> nearmiss yeah there are a few ways to do it.
[12:12:49] <duch_kazatel> it really depends on what you need it for.
[12:13:20] <MrPunkin> Rohan_Bhangui: Are you fading in those elements or anything where they wouldn't have proper width yet?
[12:13:31] <MrPunkin> Rohan_Bhangui: Something is causing them to have a width that isn't correct when running your animations.
[12:14:13] <MrPunkin> Rohan_Bhangui: Try replacing your whole document ready thing with window load instead. Just to test
[12:14:19] <MrPunkin> I know your site will be slower because of it, but to test it
[12:14:20] <MrPunkin> don't nest it
[12:14:54] <NoiseEee> nearmiss: exactly
[12:15:37] <nearmiss> thanks duch_kazatel and NoiseEee
[12:16:31] <JesseC> Does anyone know how you would select a specific value such as the title, from this json response? All of the items I'm finding on stackexchange iterate through the entire response with $.each, but there has to be a better way right?
[12:16:36] <JesseC> http://jsbin.com/eNimISo/1/edit?js,console
[12:17:23] <riseman> If anyone has sometime to help me debug the stuff i posted before it would be awesome
[12:17:54] <MrPunkin> Can anyone help me figure out speed issues with .on()? Really need to figure it out if I can.
[12:18:31] <bigbugjava> I need a way with Jquery, to move all attrbiutes from " <input type="file" name="uploads" accept="image/*" multiple />" that can be many files, onto JSON object ( after that I turn JSON,strigly..whatever) so I can send to Database
[12:18:42] <kolarski_> JesseC: console.log(data['data']['title']);
[12:19:21] <MrPunkin> Rohan_Bhangui: Marquee_one is still getting a 0 width
[12:19:26] <JesseC> kolarski_: interesting, what's the reason for the double data's?
[12:20:09] <kolarski_> this is the JSON structure you get from youtube
[12:20:17] <kolarski_> {data:{}}
[12:20:43] <JesseC> ohh, wow, I was looking directly at it and never noticed it, t hanks
[12:20:54] <Velveeta> mrpunkin: what kinds of speed issues?
[12:21:13] <Velveeta> riseman: i just rejoined the room a few minutes ago, can you repost the stuff you're referring to?
[12:21:23] <riseman> Velveeta: Sure
[12:21:33] <MrPunkin> Velveeta: I have the same function assigned to the thumbnail <a> elements as the arrow <a> elements on http://capturedemo.s3.amazonaws.com/promo/time-art.html for the widget in the article
[12:21:43] <MrPunkin> Velveeta: no affiliation with Time, just testing in a large DOM similar to where the widget will be
[12:21:44] <Velveeta> bigbugjava: you can iterate over the element's attributes property, without needing jquery
[12:21:55] <MrPunkin> Velveeta: clicking the thumb <a> is speedy, clicking the navigation <a> elements is slow
[12:22:16] <MrPunkin> Velveeta: tried assigning on() directly to the <a> element as well as to a parent with scoping
[12:22:25] <riseman> Velveeta: Im trying to fix an image slider and to debug it. Working version: http://jsfiddle.net/Sakvf/2/ (fixed) version that won't work I don't have a clue why http://zonainteractivamustakis.cl/zona-interactiva/zim-grandes-modernos/
[12:23:29] <riseman> Velveeta: for some reason at the beginning and at the end it will skip an image :S
[12:26:19] <Velveeta> mrpunkin: i'm not sure why, but your navigation arrows are kicking off a crapton of GC Events
[12:26:30] <JesseC> MrPunkin: Where's your code in all of this?
[12:27:34] <MrPunkin> JesseC: hold up. Its' not actually on the page.
[12:27:40] <MrPunkin> Velveeta: any way to see why that would be?
[12:28:06] <Velveeta> i'm not sure, you say they're wired up to the same function, in what file is that wiring up done at?
[12:28:24] <Velveeta> riseman: for your issue, what do you mean at the beginning and end it'll skip an image?
[12:28:37] <Velveeta> i went through the one in both links, and both of them seemed to cycle properly
[12:28:47] <MrPunkin> Velveeta, JesseC: here's an example of the file: http://dev.captureserver.com/galleries/1/embed.js
[12:29:02] <MrPunkin> Velveeta: its in the render() function that it sets up the events
[12:29:05] <riseman> Velveeta: the one not on the fiddle, will go from the first image to the third image
[12:29:14] <Velveeta> riseman: gotcha, i wasn't using the next/prev links
[12:29:26] <riseman> Velveeta: oh sorry, i forgot to mention that
[12:30:12] <riseman> Velveeta: the weird thing is that i'm using the exact same code. I tried in the fiddle until it was fixed, and then updated the site and it still won't work. Weird right?
[12:31:52] <nardev> is it possible easly to make some sort of "popup" dialog without dialog title and ugly horizontal bar?
[12:33:09] <bigbugjava>  nardev Check Box-Model
[12:33:13] <bigbugjava> I think You mean that
[12:33:23] <nardev> bigbugjava, thnc
[12:33:24] <nardev> thnx
[12:33:37] <Velveeta> mrpunkin: instead of an example of the file, can you point me to the actual file in the page you linked?
[12:33:56] <MrPunkin> Velveeta: that is it
[12:34:03] <MrPunkin> just a different JSON url for the data
[12:34:19] <MrPunkin> Velveeta: the only difference is the real one is compressed, but here it is: http://beta.capturemyarizona.com/galleries/234/embed.js
[12:34:45] <nardev> bigbugjava, unfortunately i don't need anything like that...
[12:35:44] <nardev> is there something like this but for regular jquery. I need to open some popups/divs and block the rest of form in under div http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.2.0-beta.1/docs/pages/popup/index.html
[12:42:43] <sarvsav> any help?
[12:43:14] <jedimind> with ?
[12:45:47] <sarvsav> Well, i am working on website : http://photografrica.com/portfolio/africa-birds/#!prettyPhoto[pp_gal]/1/
[12:46:20] <sarvsav> when someone clicks on image, the image gallery will open
[12:46:44] <sarvsav> I need, when someone click on the title of the image name in gallery, the mailto links will get change
[12:47:08] <sarvsav> in subject part of mailto, i need the image title name. how to achieve that?
[12:47:20] <sarvsav> i tried using this
[12:47:21] <sarvsav> jsfiddle.net/X4XCD/
[12:47:26] <grafi> twitter is strange
[12:47:28] <grafi> ...
[12:47:44] <sarvsav> after adding this, even the image gallery stopped displaying
[12:47:49] <sarvsav> thanks for the help
[12:48:38] <Velveeta> mrpunkin: so i'm not seeing a significant performance hit between clicking directly on a thumbnail and clicking on a navigation button instead
[12:49:04] <MrPunkin> Velveeta: the button seems to take nearly 1-2 second on mine, where thumbnails are instant
[12:49:09] <MrPunkin> Velveeta: you can't replicate?
[12:49:21] <Velveeta> mrpunkin: i get about a second lag using either method
[12:49:37] <Velveeta> and looking into your code, i see a half-second timeout on any operation that runs through displayPhoto
[12:49:43] <Velveeta> so that sounds about right
[12:50:11] <MrPunkin> Velveeta: the timeout is to scroll the thumbs, not to actually run it.
[12:50:22] <MrPunkin> Velveeta: check the "x of XX" counter in the top right, should change immediate
[12:50:24] <MrPunkin> immediately
[12:50:34] <Velveeta> gotcha
[12:50:36] <MrPunkin> it doesn't do so with nav, but does with thumbs (for me at least)
[12:51:10] <Velveeta> yeah i see what you're talking about there, there's about a half-second hiccup on changing that #
[12:51:24] <Velveeta> riseman: i haven't forgotten about you
[12:51:45] <riseman> Velveeta: ;)
[12:51:50] <sarvsav> jedimind : any idea ? how to achieve that?
[12:55:43] <zackiv31> is there a unique id on .ajaxSend and .ajaxComplete that I can use to match requests?
[12:57:29] <grafi> oO
[12:57:56] <ph88> O_o
[12:58:18] <grafi> matching send and complete to another?
[12:58:54] <zackiv31> grafi, yes
[12:59:22] <grafi> not that im aware of
[12:59:54] <grafi> why would you need that
[13:00:53] <grafi> zackiv31 http://forum.jquery.com/topic/uniquely-identifying-ajax-requests-responses
[13:12:49] <Velveeta> mrpunkin: well, i'm stuck on it‚Ä¶ through various breakpoints, it would appear to be hanging up on the last line of displayPhoto, where it's using comma-separation of those expressions inline with your wiring up of the load event handler on your image‚Ä¶
[13:13:24] <Velveeta> if i set a breakpoint on the line with the ".on('load.whatever" call itself, it hits it instantly on click, otherwse, if i move it down 2 lines, it hangs for half a second or so before hitting the next breakpoint
[13:14:04] <Velveeta> maybe try breaking those comma separated expressions out into semicolon separated statements and see if any one of them in particular are causing that hanging behavior locally
[13:14:27] <MrPunkin> Velveeta: sorry, which comma separated ones?
[13:14:53] <Velveeta> looks like that's being done as part of your minifier actually
[13:15:06] <MrPunkin> Velveeta: aha. Hmmmm
[13:15:07] <Velveeta> your last few lines where you set the img src, clear the timeout, and reset the timeout
[13:15:26] <Velveeta> they're being optimized to this: }, this)), c[0].src = s, this.thumbTimer && clearTimeout(this.thumbTimer), this.thumbTimer = setTimeout(n.proxy(this.scrollThumbs, this, "active"), 500)
[13:16:00] <Velveeta> now i'm not positive that that's the cause of anything, because like i said, in my timeline, when i record fragments of performance, clicking a navigation button is resulting in over 200 calls to a garbage collection event
[13:16:06] <MrPunkin> Wonder if I turn compression off if it will help.
[13:16:28] <Velveeta> and *that* seems to be what's causing it to hang‚Ä¶ i'm just not sure why it's actually triggering that right there, and only in that circumstance, and it appears to reliably trigger it there every time
[13:16:48] <grafi> Velveeta bug hunter
[13:16:54] <Velveeta> pew pew!
[13:16:58] <grafi> paul irish style
[13:16:59] <grafi> xD
[13:17:11] <Velveeta> he's a good one to learn from ;)
[13:17:16] <grafi> indeed
[13:17:26] <Velveeta> it almost pisses me off how smart those guys are :D
[13:17:32] <grafi> haha
[13:17:34] <grafi> yeah
[13:17:38] <grafi> :D
[13:17:41] <Velveeta> how the hell do they stay so up to date on everything simultaneously
[13:18:02] <grafi> it being part of his work probably helps a lot
[13:18:02] <grafi> :p
[13:18:15] <Velveeta> ok riseman, i'm taking another crack at yours
[13:18:38] <riseman> Sup grafi!
[13:18:40] <grafi> uuh riseman is here
[13:18:43] <grafi> hi there :D
[13:18:44] <riseman> Velveeta: awesome
[13:23:56] <JesseC> in an even that's been delegated using a selector with .on, what is "this" and $(this)?
[13:24:14] <JesseC> nm
[13:24:18] <NoiseEee> "this" is the element that has the event handler
[13:24:29] <NoiseEee> $(this) is the jqueried object of "this"
[13:24:44] <grafi> erm
[13:30:01] <Velveeta> riseman: ok, so, for some reason, the next/prev links disappeared for me on your page :D
[13:30:35] <Velveeta> but before they did, it looks like you're binding up your listener twice, as there are 2 cycle containers
[13:30:58] <Velveeta> so, depending on how that plugin broadcasts its events, if it's using $.event.trigger instead of $(this).trigger(), it may be hitting that handler twice for each click
[13:31:18] <Velveeta> so i'm watching the index value of the images being cycled through, and for the first 5 or so images, it skips them by 2's instead of 1 at a time
[13:31:46] <riseman> Velveeta: small change on CSS, they should appear with a hard refresh
[13:31:53] <Velveeta> gotcha
[13:32:23] <riseman> Velveeta: Weird thing is that it's the same setup as in the fiddle
[13:32:29] <Velveeta> they're still not appearing for me
[13:32:46] <Velveeta> unless you mean that they're now < and > buttons
[13:32:50] <Velveeta> versus the worded ones
[13:33:55] <hugo_moss> hey i am using magento along with prototype.js, and zurb foundation.  i found that when calling foundation, it calls prototypes bind, instead of calling jquerys bind. how can i fix this?
[13:34:20] <riseman> Velveeta: yup, its the small icons
[13:36:07] <hugo_moss> or maybe its trying to call the native bind
[13:36:29] <duch_kazatel> hugo wait you're using prototype AND jquery?
[13:37:52] <duch_kazatel> hugo_moss if you absolutely MUST use both, http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.noConflict/
[13:39:52] <riseman> Velveeta: what could be firing the handler twice?
[13:40:05] <Velveeta> i'm still looking into that
[13:41:24] <riseman> Velveeta: oh ok!
[13:43:42] <MrPunkin> Velveeta: set e.stopPropagation in my click handler, all is well now.
[13:44:00] <Velveeta> interesting
[13:44:38] <MrPunkin> Wonder if it's their own site's jQuery click handling trying to catch it bubbling
[13:45:01] <MrPunkin> we are knowing this will be going into sites with existing jQuery framework interactions so we have to prevent those problems I guess
[13:46:34] <hugo_moss> ok its not calling jqueries bind
[13:46:48] <duch_kazatel> hugo_moss yeah it's calling prototype's.
[13:47:02] <hugo_moss> its calling the native bind function, and prototype i think overriding the bind function?
[13:47:05] <duch_kazatel> hugo_moss i all ready gave you the solution - noconclic.
[13:47:08] <duch_kazatel> *conflict
[13:47:23] <hugo_moss> i know of noconflict
[13:47:30] <hugo_moss> but that wont do it
[13:47:43] <duch_kazatel> why are you using both libs at the same time?
[13:47:46] <duch_kazatel> why not pick up?
[13:47:49] <duch_kazatel> *pick one?
[13:47:50] <hugo_moss> im using magento
[13:47:58] <hugo_moss> and magento uses prototype.js by default
[13:48:01] <hugo_moss> for 1.7.2
[13:48:06] <hugo_moss> i think in 1.8 they changed to jquery
[13:48:23] <duch_kazatel> hahahahaha bummer.  we used magento and had nothing but problems.
[13:48:29] <hugo_moss> really
[13:48:39] <hugo_moss> what version
[13:48:43] <hugo_moss> what did you use instead
[13:48:45] <duch_kazatel> a few.
[13:48:55] <duch_kazatel> we use a homebuilt solution instead.
[13:49:00] <hugo_moss> oh ok
[13:49:04] <hugo_moss> how long did that take
[13:49:16] <duch_kazatel> lol we had a homebuilt solution all ready.
[13:49:20] <hugo_moss> oh ok
[13:49:26] <hugo_moss> lucky you
[13:49:28] <duch_kazatel> about 10 years old that got regular updates.  we tested out replacing it with magento.
[13:49:44] <duch_kazatel> and found that magento didn't have the features it needed.  iirc no real way to send quotes for instance.
[13:50:16] <hugo_moss> duch, can you tell me if thats what prototype's bind method is doing, it is overriding the native bind function?
[13:50:45] <hugo_moss> im kind of confused
[13:50:51] <duch_kazatel> no idea.
[13:51:10] <hugo_moss> prototypes bind method is inside an anonymous function so it doesnt pollute the global namespace
[13:51:27] <hugo_moss> ( function{})()
[13:51:37] <hugo_moss> and creates a bind method in there
[13:51:49] <duch_kazatel> dunno man.
[13:51:53] <duch_kazatel> i gotta go drink while at work.
[13:51:54] <duch_kazatel> enjoy.
[13:52:31] <hugo_moss> ill ask in javascript
[13:58:44] <MrPunkin> Velveeta: check it now: http://capturedemo.s3.amazonaws.com/promo/time-art.html
[13:59:01] <Velveeta> much better
[14:04:33] <rmcdaniel> any ideas or demos on how I can take a fixed footer and make it draggable so I can reveal more content below it when the user pulls it up?
[14:05:33] <fl0rian_> rmcdaniel u need jquery-ui
[14:05:59] <rmcdaniel> oh sorry, I should have mentioned, I'm trying to do this with jqm
[14:06:11] <fl0rian_> ah, ok sorry
[14:06:39] <fl0rian_> i meant you "could" do it with jquery-ui

[14:19:56] <MILLIONAIRE> hi
[14:20:06] <MILLIONAIRE> can someone tell me how to upload my project to github
[14:20:29] <nullx> 1) download and install git, 2) read a tutorial =)
[14:20:37] <nullx> it's too much explaining seriously
[14:20:51] <nullx> understand git, then learn how to github
[14:20:53] <MILLIONAIRE> i need help
[14:21:16] <grafi> in what step specifically?
[14:21:19] <grafi> *on
[14:21:41] <MILLIONAIRE> i created a repository thru the website
[14:21:50] <MILLIONAIRE> i am done with my project
[14:21:53] <MILLIONAIRE> i got to turn it in now
[14:22:14] <grafi> have you read the tutorial?
[14:23:08] <grafi> git setup on your computer`
[14:23:09] <grafi> ?
[14:25:24] <ajustrun> MILLIONAIRE: you can try the github app, that might help
[14:26:04] <riseman> Velveeta: Fixed it!! It was an inception kinda thing...
[14:27:01] <grafi> riseman: did you go deeper? :P
[14:35:08] <fl0rian_> MILLIONARE: go into the project dir and type "git init"
[14:36:27] <riseman> grafi: hahaha yeah man! Deep dive
[14:37:19] <Bloomberg> is this
[14:37:20] <Bloomberg> http://jsbin.com/uzIsOPI/1/
[14:37:33] <hugo_moss> i have 2 javascript files in my head tag, and i need them to execute in order, and the first inserted js must be run before the second, will the order that i add these files guarantee that one runs before the other?
[14:42:36] <Bloomberg> ready
[14:42:38] <Bloomberg> Fix it!!
[14:47:51] <fauntle> I see some references to npm in jQuery's repository
[14:47:59] <fauntle> but I don't think it's quite up on there yet
[14:50:05] <fl0rian_> hugo_moss: yes
[14:50:56] <fauntle> fl0rian_: any idea on when that'll hit? Is there a conflict with the existing 'jquery' and 'jQuery' entries on npm?
[14:52:11] <fl0rian_> fauntle sorry i dont understand. iam a beginner too
[14:52:33] <fl0rian_> fauntle what do you mean with npm?
[14:54:45] <fauntle> fl0rian_: whoops, thought that was a reply to me
[14:54:50] <Bloomberg> TypeError: 'stepUp' called on an object that does not implement interface HTMLInputElement.
[14:54:53] <Bloomberg> Why show me this!!
[14:55:00] <fl0rian_> fauntle ah, ok :)
[14:55:12] <fauntle> fl0rian_: basically, I'm wondering when/if jQuery will be available on npm. It has a package.json filled out, but isn't actually published.
[14:56:29] <fl0rian_> fauntle ok. sorry i dont know...
[14:57:02] <duch_kazatel> fauntle https://npmjs.org/package/jquery
[14:57:15] <duch_kazatel> it's available now.
[14:57:35] <fauntle> duch_kazatel: as I understand it, that's not official
[14:58:12] <duch_kazatel> sorry i was late to the convo - you mean from the jquery team?
[14:58:18] <fauntle> duch_kazatel: right
[14:58:34] <fauntle> jquery itself has a package.json, which means it can be distributed on npm, it's just not deployed up there as far as I can see
[14:58:49] <duch_kazatel> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/13119
[14:58:51] <duch_kazatel> interesting
[15:07:33] <louism2wash> Hey guys, does anyone know of a good resource that explains how jquery/javascript performs lookup on the DOM?  I am trying to understand how to most efficiently lookup/traverse the DOM.  Thanks.
[15:09:07] <plambwk> can i be your sub and will you be my dom
[15:10:04] <fl0rian_> plambwk :)
[15:10:57] <fl0rian_> louism2wash there are many ways... to query the DOM
[15:11:38] <fl0rian_> louism2wash the best resource i know is jquery itself
[15:12:05] <duch_kazatel> louism2wash that's a loaded question.
[15:12:09] <fl0rian_> but maybe there is a better....?
[15:12:16] <jtal> anyone here use inputs in bootstrap modals?
[15:12:19] <louism2wash> how is that a loaded question?
[15:13:21] <duch_kazatel> http://moduscreate.com/efficient-dom-and-css/
[15:13:25] <duch_kazatel> here's one article on the subject.
[15:14:02] <duch_kazatel> but it depends on what you're doing.  native methods are faster than jquery methods depending on case.
[15:15:08] <fl0rian_> duch_kazatel thx, thats very interessting
[15:15:15] <duch_kazatel> and this SO: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4651923/when-to-use-vanilla-javascriptvs-jquery
[15:15:36] <louism2wash>  <duch_kazatel>: just trying to crawl before I walk
[15:15:37] <duch_kazatel> i'd get shot by some folks for saying this, but there IS such a thing as premature optimization.
[15:15:48] <duch_kazatel> learn the basic toolkit, learn what to use and when.
[15:16:00] <duch_kazatel> learn your options and apply as necessary.
[15:16:20] <duch_kazatel> and with that, i need to go back to the office party.
[15:16:24] <duch_kazatel> enjoy
[15:22:53] <ajustrun> hey guys im having a really weird issue
[15:23:10] <ajustrun> im using jquery validate and the submitehandler
[15:23:16] <ajustrun> submitHandler*
[15:23:41] <ajustrun> and before the form submits i want to pop up a lightbox that says submitting... with a loading image
[15:23:55] <ajustrun> and its working but the images are broken for some reason
[15:24:12] <ajustrun> if i launch the lightbox not in the submithandler then everything is fine
[15:24:21] <ajustrun> any idea what might be causing that? i have no idea where to even start
[15:40:52] <Quest> I have a .click function on a .class but the there are many divs on the page that has the same class. obviously.     How can I delete the    parent (not direct parent. it may be a grand parent or grand grand parent)  of that div (the div ONLY on which the .class was applied and was clicked )? should I use the this keyword? and how to reach the parent? the  trick is that the parent has the class .parent but I only want to delete the parent of the clicked div
[15:40:52] <Quest> .?
[15:41:54] <MrPunkin>  Quest: $(this).parents('.parent') ?
[15:42:10] <Quest> hm
[15:42:30] <karstenk1977_> good evening
[15:43:00] <karstenk1977_> plz can you help me with a selector?
[15:43:21] <Quest> MrPunkin,  .parents will target  ALL the parents of THIS that has .parent class applied to them?     I only want the first matched parent . starting from inside
[15:43:51] <MrPunkin> Quest: First of all, there has to be a better way than having a ton of elements with the class .parent, right?
[15:43:58] <karstenk1977_> I have to find tags 'marker' where its attribute distance is smaller than my variable Radius. jQuery(xml).find('Marker').attr('distance', ???? ???!);
[15:44:05] <MrPunkin> Quest: what about doing $(this).parents('.parent').first()?
[15:44:56] <MrPunkin> Quest: I assume parent isn't the direct parent of the object or else you'd just use .parent(), correct?
[15:45:16] <Quest> Mrgoose,  that will only delete the first parent ? first parent from inside. i mean the closest parent. not grand parent?
[15:45:51] <Quest> Mrgoose,    yes. its like       some dv - parent - some div - this
[15:46:11] <Quest> Mrgoose,           or          some dv - parent - some div - some more divs - this
[15:46:25] <Quest> Mrgoose,           or        parent- parent-   some dv - parent - some div - some more divs - this
[15:46:29] <MrPunkin> Quest: I assume you are talking to me?
[15:46:43] <Quest> I only want to delete the first parent from right
[15:46:50] <Quest> MrPunkin,  sory. yes
[15:48:35] <Quest> MrPunkin,  i will try and be back
[15:48:39] <MrPunkin> Quest: try the .first() method. I don't know if its the closest but I'd assume since I'd assume that the source for parents moves up the DOM
[15:50:16] <MrPunkin> Quest: It could be last() as well, depending on how they traverse the DOM
[15:52:36] <karstenk1977_> can anybody help?
[15:53:35] <jphase> karstenk1977_: I don't think you can do logic inside a selector, you'll have to iterate through those
[15:53:48] <Quest> MrPunkin,  ok.
[15:54:18] <duch_kazatel> jphase what do you mean "logic inside a selector‚Äù?
[15:54:21] <MrPunkin> karstenk1977_: As jphase says, iterate through until the distance logic matches
[15:54:38] <jphase> duch_kazatel: like where an [attributeName<=30]
[15:54:39] <MrPunkin> duch_kazatel: see karstenk1977_'s question above
[15:54:59] <jphase> he wants to check for attributes "between" two vals
[15:56:19] <duch_kazatel> aaaah.  yeah I‚Äôm pretty sure you can‚Äôt do that kind of logic.
[15:57:11] <duch_kazatel> http://api.jquery.com/attribute-equals-selector/ says it has to be a string.
[15:57:23] <jphase> I think the fanciest selectors I know are the wildcard ones and pseudo selectors, that's really all their is right?
[15:57:46] <duch_kazatel> ‚Äúfanciest‚Äù lol.
[15:57:47] <jphase> include jQuery's pseudo selectors that is
[15:57:50] <jphase> hehe
[15:58:14] <duch_kazatel> as long as whatever is passed returns a string, it‚Äôs valid.
[15:58:21] <jphase> well, once I realized it really was just only those three (or I think?) then selectors lost their mysticism and I started treating it like glorified css with the additional wildcard
[15:58:25] <jphase> er... occassional*
[15:58:36] <duch_kazatel> so you can do stuff like $(‚Äò#‚Äô + myCurrentDivName)
[16:00:16] <TigerParket> Hello people, i have an issue that i want to fix with jquery, it's a question of thumbnails that i load in a responsive layout -> this is the mockup https://gomockingbird.com/mockingbird/#ig81yea/mBiAW
[16:01:00] <TigerParket> Can someone please advice me something about it ?
[16:01:39] <duch_kazatel> Tiger just ask. if somebody can help they will.
[16:01:57] <tds5016> hi all.
[16:02:25] <TigerParket> I want to load items dependently on space that i have -> as the mockup here https://gomockingbird.com/mockingbird/#ig81yea/mBiAW
[16:02:25] <tds5016> I'm having an issue where $(window).off('resize', this.render) appears to not be removing the resize event in a backbone view.
[16:02:46] <tds5016> can soemone help me figure out why $(window).off('resize', functionName) may not be working?
[16:04:53] <duch_kazatel> tds5016 huh?  are you trying to prevent the resize event?
[16:05:05] <tds5016> on that specific view, yes.
[16:05:29] <tds5016> I'm trying to unbind it from the windows when I call the close() method on a backbone view.
[16:06:01] <tds5016> duch_kazatel: ^
[16:06:02] <duch_kazatel> you have to pass three args.
[16:06:11] <tds5016> oh, what trhee args?
[16:06:12] <duch_kazatel> the event, the selector, and the handler.
[16:06:16] <duch_kazatel> http://api.jquery.com/off/
[16:06:20] <Quest> MrPunkin,  its first()
[16:06:24] <Quest> works i gues
[16:06:51] <tds5016> $(window).off('resize', this.render)
[16:06:51] <shoky> nah you don't need to pass a selector
[16:06:53] <tds5016> that isn't right?
[16:07:13] <tds5016> there's no selector to pass, window is what I bound resize on, and render is the handlres.
[16:07:27] <duch_kazatel> I‚Äôm just reading the docs
[16:07:47] <shoky> duch_kazatel: [, selector]  means it's optional
[16:08:24] <duch_kazatel> .off( events [, selector ] ) vs. .off( events [, selector ] [, handler(eventObject) ] )
[16:08:33] <shoky> [ ]  means optional
[16:08:47] <duch_kazatel> how does it discern between the two then?
[16:09:06] <duch_kazatel> how does it know that the second arg is an event vs. a selector?
[16:09:09] <shoky> one has an object and one a string
[16:09:12] <shoky> (for the first argument)
[16:09:26] <shoky> huh?
[16:09:29] <MrPunkin> Quest: good deal
[16:09:33] <shoky> the 2nd arg is never an event
[16:09:42] <shoky> it's either a selector or a function
[16:09:54] <duch_kazatel> hrm.
[16:09:56] <duch_kazatel> kay
[16:09:57] <shoky> if ( selector === false || typeof selector === "function" ) {  fn = selector;  ...
[16:10:05] <duch_kazatel> weird.
[16:10:05] <duch_kazatel> okay
[16:10:53] <duch_kazatel> i‚Äôm aware that the docs say things within square brackets are optional, but I guess I always thought i there were three args you had pass the first two before you could pass the third.
[16:10:58] <duch_kazatel> but i‚Äôve been wrong before.
[16:11:12] <shoky> that would make the square brackets very misleading
[16:12:37] <tds5016> is there a way to print out the window.resize() event listeners to make sure that it's actualyl being removed?
[16:14:39] <shoky> tds5016: you can try $._data(window, 'events')
[16:14:58] <tds5016> thanks shoky, I'll try that now.
[16:15:19] <Quest> MrPunkin,  how to get the id of $(this).parents(".box").first()
[16:15:46] <duch_kazatel> .attr(‚Äòid‚Äô)
[16:15:52] <MrPunkin> Quest: two ways, $(this).parents(".box").first().attr('id') or $(this).parents(".box").first()[0].id
[16:15:54] <Quest> hm
[16:16:08] <Quest> thx
[16:16:31] <Quest> can .attr(ëidí) == .attr("id")  ?
[16:16:43] <duch_kazatel> if id = ‚Äòid‚Äô
[16:16:45] <duch_kazatel> lol
[16:17:03] <shoky> either 'id' or "id",  not ‚Äòid‚Äô   :P
[16:17:09] <duch_kazatel> haha
[16:18:12] <Quest> k
[16:19:03] <TigerParket> Please anyone knows a plugin to simplify what i want to do in my responsive layout ? https://gomockingbird.com/mockingbird/#ig81yea/mBiAW
[16:19:47] <duch_kazatel> masonry
[16:19:49] <duch_kazatel> probably.
[16:22:04] <tds5016> yup... turns out I'm incredibly stupid and I just forgot to call the close function as I was closing the view.
[16:22:12] <tds5016> I deserve to punch myself repeatedly in the nards.
[16:26:14] <MrPunkin> TigerParket: Seems easy enough with simple media queries and CSS
[16:26:35] <TigerParket> MrPunkin: light my mind
[16:27:10] <MrPunkin> TigerParket: Well I assume these are a few breakpoints? Just change the width / height / formatting of a UL element for the thumbs and the position of that element on the page depending on the breakpoint
[16:27:37] <MrPunkin> then your JS would simply need to know which format it's in for moving the tray of thumsbs
[16:27:39] <MrPunkin> thumbs*
[16:27:57] <TigerParket> MrPunkin: but i will have to paginate that thumbs i can have two or 60 it's dynamic
[16:28:54] <MrPunkin> Right, Just size them inside the box appropriate to the size of the parent
[16:29:56] <TigerParket> MrPunkin: ok but i need some js here or a plugin, it's ok for positionning with css depending on breakpoints no prob
[16:30:26] <TigerParket> MrPunkin: But what's about choose to paginate two items or four depending on the breakpoint i'm in
[16:30:52] <TigerParket> MrPunkin: I think i understand now
[16:30:54] <MrPunkin> TigerParket: I was assuming all items would be on page, and you'd just scroll to reveal
[16:31:02] <MrPunkin> TigerParket: if your actually paginating, it'll be a bit more work
[16:31:16] <TigerParket> MrPunkin: Just some JS scroll it will be ok
[16:32:00] <TigerParket> MrPunkin: This discussion made me understand :)
[16:32:07] <MrPunkin> nice!
[16:32:08] <TigerParket> MrPunkin: i'm going to try a scroll thing
[16:32:12] <TigerParket> Thanks
[16:32:17] <MrPunkin> TigerParket: Yep, no prob
[16:37:27] <Ricaz> Anyone know of a cool HTML5 on-screen keyboard?
[16:40:10] <Quest> any idea why it is? TypeError: $(...).attr(...) is undefined          $(".box").attr(id).remove();
[16:41:29] <duch_kazatel> Quest attr(‚Äòid‚Äô)
[16:41:35] <shoky> Quest:  it's .attr('id') not .attr(id). that returns the id as a string, you can't .remove() a string
[16:41:45] <shoky> Quest: you might be looking for .removeAttr('id')
[16:46:20] <Quest> duch_kazatel,  shoky  .   i know http://pastebin.ca/2468419
[16:47:28] <shoky> ?
[16:47:57] <Quest> shoky,  oh so how to remove a .class div that has "some id"      from dom?
[16:48:53] <shoky> $('#someId').remove()  ?
[16:49:03] <Quest> i mean. remove the div from dom       that has a .someClass        and has #someId
[16:49:11] <shoky> no need to check for the class
[16:49:17] <shoky> as ID's have to be unique
[16:49:31] <Quest> I have to becuase there might be some other div with same id?
[16:49:34] <shoky> $('#someID').remove()  is all you need
[16:49:42] <shoky> Quest that would be wrong, you should never do that
[16:49:45] <Quest> shoky,  hm....... ok
[16:50:02] <shoky> if you need elements to share an id.. use a class instead
[16:50:47] <Quest> shoky,  for my case    in $('#someId').remove()          the someId is actually a variable . so puttting # with it will make it a string . how i get the value ?
[16:50:58] <shoky> Quest but instead of sending the id to your function
[16:51:03] <shoky> just send the element
[16:52:05] <shoky> e.g.  http://pastebin.ca/2468420
[16:52:11] <Quest> how about $("#"+id).remove();
[16:52:38] <Quest> hm..
[16:52:39] <Quest> ok
[16:52:49] <shoky> that's fine too. but no need to requery the DOM if you already did it before
[16:57:29] <Quest> shoky,  hm. works great and smarter .. thanks
[16:58:49] <TigerParket> MrPunkin: i will use that plugin http://als.musings.it/ with my breakpoints
[16:59:02] <MrPunkin> nice
[18:50:44] <LoneSoldier728> hey any request users here?
[18:50:52] <TigerParket> So the question is, how to change my jQuery settings according to my breakpoints ?
[19:33:27] <TigerParket> What is the smartest solution to change jQuery parameters with CSS breakpoints (responsive)
[20:04:03] <LoneSoldier728> how do you do something with fetch() after you call it on a backbone collection
[20:04:17] <LoneSoldier728> I am trying to pass the data from .fetch() to my view
[20:08:08] <admintheturtle> hi
[20:09:14] <admintheturtle> how to alert when hidden input change it's value?
[20:11:58] <karstenk1977_> hello, anybody still wake up?
[20:12:07] <admintheturtle> guess not
[20:12:19] <karstenk1977_> :-)
[20:12:39] <admintheturtle> is quite difficult to make this
[20:12:40] <karstenk1977_> would you help me by a filtered selector?
[20:12:55] <admintheturtle> isotope?
[20:13:01] <karstenk1977_> its a bit tricky
[20:13:04] <tw2113> never realized hidden input values were meant to dynamically change
[20:13:46] <admintheturtle> you can see my problem‚Ä¶ a am trying to use this coding http://tympanus.net/Development/SimpleDropDownEffects/
[20:13:51] <admintheturtle> hidden will change
[20:14:06] <karstenk1977_> i need a selector for my tags "markers" where the attr value is smaller my variable Radius
[20:14:25] <admintheturtle> i just want to make a div to hide when an item is choosen
[20:14:42] <tw2113> that looks like a select input with 5 options
[20:14:42] <karstenk1977_> can anybody help?
[20:14:53] <admintheturtle> well its not a select
[20:15:02] <tw2113> i just looked at the source code
[20:15:04] <tw2113> it's a select
[20:15:04] <admintheturtle> its changed to an ul list
[20:15:21] <karstenk1977_> i thought about filter() but all my trys end without the right select
[20:15:41] <admintheturtle> hummm‚Ä¶.. can you see the ul?
[20:15:46] <tw2113> yes, in chrome/firefox inspector, it appears as a hidden input
[20:15:49] <admintheturtle> ul li
[20:15:52] <tw2113> cmd+u says select
[20:16:08] <admintheturtle> I'm stuck with this
[20:16:58] <admintheturtle> it transforms a select to an ul
[20:17:36] <admintheturtle> the initial code is in fact a select, but it transforms it, and now my actions won't work anymore
[20:17:40] <tw2113> that it does, in the jquery.dropdown.js file that's added to the page
[20:17:49] <admintheturtle> exactly
[20:18:41] <admintheturtle> i mixed with this code http://jsfiddle.net/XfPv7/1/
[20:19:13] <admintheturtle> the main propose is to hide and show divs
[20:19:41] <admintheturtle> on select, but since now its an ul with hidden input i don't know how to do it
[20:19:50] <tw2113> i don't see where you included the js file
[20:20:32] <admintheturtle> what js?
[20:20:44] <admintheturtle> above the html code
[20:20:56] <tw2113> line 1 is the select input
[20:21:07] <admintheturtle> no wait
[20:21:20] <admintheturtle> I'm just telling i used that code
[20:21:29] <admintheturtle> i have a different code
[20:21:30] <tw2113> not in the jsfiddle you haven't
[20:21:40] <admintheturtle> its not my jsfidle
[20:22:00] <tw2113> then why did you link it?
[20:22:54] <admintheturtle> because the main propose is the one of the jsfidle  ( hide and show) my problem is that that query isn't working since is not a select anymore
[20:23:12] <LoneSoldier728> backbone specialist here?
[20:23:16] <LoneSoldier728> how do i do something with fetch?
[20:23:21] <karstenk1977_> can that work jQuery(xml).find("Marker").filter(int(jQuery(xml).find("Marker").attr('distance')) < rad); ???
[20:23:54] <admintheturtle> is it possible to do it?
[20:24:03] <tw2113> if you set up your own attempt at making it work in a jsfiddle, someone could actually help debug why it's failing
[20:24:17] <admintheturtle> ok let me make one
[20:32:24] <admintheturtle> i can't make it work http://jsfiddle.net/admintheturtle/zFMxh/
[20:32:34] <admintheturtle> don't know whats the problem
[20:33:21] <tw2113> you're not including the plugin file or whatever that causes it to happen
[20:33:31] <tw2113> i still see no jquery.dropdown.js or whatever the filename was
[20:34:30] <admintheturtle> isnt in the external resources?
[20:34:56] <tw2113> no
[20:34:59] <admintheturtle> humm
[20:35:09] <admintheturtle> its in the <head> where then?
[20:35:15] <admintheturtle> how can i call it?
[20:35:30] <admintheturtle> sorry tw2123 for all this trouble
[20:35:43] <tw2113> sorry for what trouble
[20:35:47] <tw2113> it's a support channel, we're both in it
[20:35:51] <tw2113> you're asking for support
[20:36:06] <admintheturtle> thank you for you patience then
[20:36:45] <tw2113> http://jsfiddle.net/zFMxh/1/
[20:37:17] <admintheturtle> http://jsfiddle.net/admintheturtle/zFMxh/2/
[20:38:48] <tw2113> looks like it relies on modernizr too
[20:39:01] <admintheturtle> yes but where do i call it?
[20:39:08] <tw2113> firefox console is throwing errors due to its lack
[20:39:18] <admintheturtle> since i can't ccreate a <head> tag
[20:39:39] <tw2113> did you click view source to see how that demo is being used?
[20:40:02] <tw2113> http://d.pr/n/6rRa
[20:40:56] <admintheturtle> http://jsfiddle.net/admintheturtle/zFMxh/3/
[20:41:29] <tw2113> your fiddle copies still have no jquery.dropdown.js file added
[20:41:35] <tw2113> and it's going to need modernizr as well
[20:42:06] <admintheturtle> but i call the files on the first box can you see?
[20:42:34] <tw2113> you call http://tympanus.net/Development/SimpleDropDownEffects/js/modernizr.custom.63321.js
[20:42:35] <tw2113> but that's it
[20:42:47] <tw2113> ah wait, i scrolled down
[20:43:09] <tw2113> now you need to properly use the plugin
[20:43:17] <tw2113> like in my drp.lr link
[20:43:30] <tw2113> er d.pr link
[20:43:43] <admintheturtle> im lost
[20:43:58] <tw2113> click view source on http://tympanus.net/Development/SimpleDropDownEffects/ and scroll to the end
[20:44:11] <tw2113> line 72-78
[20:46:41] <admintheturtle> wait how can i see the line number on the inspect
[20:46:55] <Ansikt> I wanna try to make one of those dropdowns with just css.
[20:47:26] <Ansikt> admintheturtle: there's no line number because the inspect could be totally different from the actual source.
[20:47:28] <tw2113> click cmd+u
[20:47:33] <tw2113> not browser inspector
[20:47:39] <Ansikt> Because it's the DOM, not a source view
[20:47:42] <Ansikt> But yeah
[20:47:50] <Ansikt> CMD+U is the answer you're looking for
[20:47:55] <admintheturtle> ok
[20:47:57] <admintheturtle> im there
[20:48:13] <admintheturtle> i can see the lines
[20:48:40] <tw2113> those lines are what use the code in jquery.dropdown.js to make the select statement into what you see in inspector
[20:49:16] <tw2113> you need to do the same with your jsfiddle, and your own select's ID attribute
[20:49:45] <admintheturtle> http://jsfiddle.net/admintheturtle/zFMxh/4/
[20:49:51] <admintheturtle> nice
[20:50:24] <admintheturtle> this is where I'm stuck right now
[20:50:33] <admintheturtle> I'm using a wordpress instalation
[20:50:43] <admintheturtle> and this what i see
[20:54:54] <admintheturtle> tw2113 are u there?
[20:56:08] <tw2113> why are you adding your own ul?
[20:56:12] <tw2113> the plugin does that for you
[20:56:44] <tw2113> all you need is the select input
[20:57:08] <admintheturtle> sorry
[20:57:18] <admintheturtle> can you fork so i understand?
[20:57:31] <tw2113> delete the div with the ul that you added
[20:57:34] <tw2113> keep the select
[20:57:52] <admintheturtle> you don't understand
[20:57:52] <tw2113> then in the result panel, inspect it and see the ul generated automatically
[20:58:34] <tw2113> obviously not
[20:58:39] <tw2113> i see the plugin working though
[20:59:35] <admintheturtle> can you see this one http://jsfiddle.net/XfPv7/1/
[21:00:00] <admintheturtle> when you select an option the div below is updated
[21:00:34] <tw2113> yup
[21:00:44] <admintheturtle> hats the point
[21:00:46] <admintheturtle> thats
[21:00:47] <tw2113> from the sounds of it, you're trying to mix your own functionality with $fancyplugin
[21:00:59] <admintheturtle> no fancy
[21:01:10] <tw2113> that plugin looks awfuly fancy to me
[21:02:02] <admintheturtle> yes but i want it to work, because i need to have images on the select, and since the select won't allow any style like that i was trying to mix both
[21:02:29] <hExDJ> I have a form and  certain inputs change, depending on selects in the same form, but if a user types text in those inputs, the values stop being calculated, any recommendations?
[21:02:41] <admintheturtle> so how can i hide and show divs when i make a selection on my jsfiddle
[21:02:51] <hExDJ> I could disable the input, but that grays out the field itself, and I would like to avoid that
[21:03:18] <tw2113> dunno
[21:03:28] <admintheturtle> lol
[21:03:45] <admintheturtle> really?
[21:03:52] <tw2113> i'm no grand master
[21:03:59] <tw2113> but i manage to get by well enough
[21:04:11] <admintheturtle> :/
[21:04:28] <tw2113> analyze the plugin to see how it does what it does
[21:04:36] <admintheturtle> well i want my money back
[21:04:50] <admintheturtle> i know what it does
[21:04:59] <tw2113> the question isn't what it does
[21:05:01] <tw2113> it's how it does it
[21:05:22] <admintheturtle> when you click an option the hidden input changes it's name
[21:05:29] <tw2113> so that you can imitate and adapt for your own need
[21:05:53] <admintheturtle> i need a function that when that changes the div hides
[21:06:03] <admintheturtle> hides and shows
[21:06:09] <admintheturtle> do you get it?
[21:06:16] <admintheturtle> do you think you can help
[21:06:18] <hExDJ> .change()
[21:07:20] <hExDJ> $('#hidden_input').change(function() {  $('#some_div'	).hide();    });
[21:07:47] <admintheturtle> hexdj http://jsfiddle.net/admintheturtle/zFMxh/4/
[21:07:55] <admintheturtle> can you fork it?
[21:08:31] <hExDJ> 1 sec
[21:09:08] <hExDJ> what do you want to hide?
[21:09:15] <hExDJ> and, depending on what?
[21:10:31] <admintheturtle> look at this one
[21:10:33] <admintheturtle> http://jsfiddle.net/XfPv7/1/
[21:11:01] <admintheturtle> when you select the <div class="scroll-content"> changes it's content
[21:11:23] <admintheturtle> i used this script http://tympanus.net/Development/SimpleDropDownEffects/
[21:11:29] <admintheturtle> and mice it
[21:11:33] <admintheturtle> mixed it
[21:11:51] <admintheturtle> the code changes the select to an ul
[21:12:07] <admintheturtle> there's a hidden input
[21:12:28] <hExDJ> I have no idea what you want
[21:14:59] <admintheturtle> hmmm
[21:15:04] <admintheturtle> when you select
[21:15:25] <admintheturtle> it should change the content
[21:15:32] <admintheturtle> just like the first jsfiddle
[21:15:56] <hExDJ> seems your second fiddle already does that
[21:16:31] <admintheturtle> the first one has a different menu
[21:16:43] <admintheturtle> its my fork
[21:16:57] <admintheturtle> mixed with tympanus script
[21:18:29] <admintheturtle> well try this out.. forget the jsfiddle and the rest
[21:18:44] <admintheturtle> i have an hidden input
[21:19:09] <admintheturtle> when that input changes its's name="" it should do somwthing
[21:19:21] <admintheturtle> how can i do that? the input has no id or class
[21:19:31] <hExDJ> what input by the way?
[21:19:31] <hExDJ> I don't see it in your code
[21:19:45] <admintheturtle> you have to run it
[21:19:54] <hExDJ> u mean the select?
[21:20:03] <admintheturtle> no
[21:20:06] <admintheturtle> forget all
[21:20:12] <admintheturtle> look into this one
[21:20:13] <admintheturtle> http://tympanus.net/Development/SimpleDropDownEffects/
[21:20:20] <admintheturtle> no select at all
[21:20:27] <admintheturtle> just an ul list
[21:20:40] <admintheturtle> inspect it and see the hidden input?
[21:21:06] <hExDJ> ok, what about
[21:21:06] <hExDJ> it
[21:22:07] <admintheturtle> i want to make an alert when the hidden input changes
[21:22:26] <admintheturtle> alert with the new value
[21:24:38] <admintheturtle> what do you think about it?
[21:25:10] <hExDJ> I do not see it
[21:25:10] <hExDJ> in the html
[21:25:37] <hExDJ> hold on, cause my connection is shitty
[21:25:41] <hExDJ> am at a coffee shop
[21:26:51] <admintheturtle> then inspect show something different than the source
[21:26:55] <admintheturtle> wtf?
[21:27:34] <hExDJ> I don't see the hidden input you keep refering too
[21:27:35] <hExDJ> to
[21:27:49] <admintheturtle> if you inspect it you can see
[21:28:26] <hExDJ> but it's not initially in the DOM
[21:28:31] <hExDJ> that must be part of their JS
[21:29:06] <hExDJ> which is jquery.dropdown,js probably
[21:30:52] <hExDJ> it shouldn't be hard to implement
[21:30:56] <hExDJ> one sec.
[21:35:49] <hExDJ> I was just looking at it with Firebug
[21:35:57] <hExDJ> it's not the hidden field that you have to worry about
[21:36:29] <admintheturtle> whats then?
[21:36:48] <hExDJ> basically you have to look at the text inside the first span tag
[21:37:07] <hExDJ> because that's the one that will give you the "current" selected item
[21:37:37] <admintheturtle> ok
[21:38:33] <admintheturtle> and then?
[21:38:40] <hExDJ> and then you can do a switch ($('#thespanid').text()) { case 'elephant': do whatever; break, case 'horse': do horesy stuff ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ }
[21:39:13] <hExDJ> but you will have to give that first span an ID, to target it more easily
[21:39:54] <admintheturtle> i cant
[21:40:42] <hExDJ> ah yeah that's part of the script also
[21:41:00] <admintheturtle> damm\
[21:41:42] <hExDJ> you can do ($('ul.countrylist span').first()
[21:43:29] <admintheturtle> ok
[21:45:45] <admintheturtle> and then
[21:51:41] <hExDJ> ugh I can't take this stupid connection anymore
[21:51:46] <hExDJ> brb going home
[22:05:51] <hExDJ> back
