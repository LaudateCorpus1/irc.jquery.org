[01:20:54] <HoloIRCUser> hi
[01:22:34] <HoloIRCUser> can i toggle between 2 function?
[02:03:27] <Cork> HoloIRCUser: sure, but there isn't anything built into jquery for that
[02:03:40] <Cork> (there was but it has been removed since a few versions)
[02:04:31] <Cork> HoloIRCUser: it is quite easy to do though, just use $(this).data('my-state') and store the state and then just check it on next triggering
[04:58:05] <Northwoods> jquery ui sometimes misses with backspace
[04:58:09] <Northwoods> any known concern ?
[04:58:25] <Northwoods> i mean jquery ui autocomplete , misses after using backspace key
[04:58:29] <Northwoods> any known issues
[05:57:44] <Cork> Northwoods: no, never seen it here
[05:58:11] <Cork> Northwoods: might be delay for response from server?
[05:59:11] <Northwoods> Cork, thanks , i dont knw when i was pulling 5 records from server it was facing this problem, i changed it to 12 records, its working perfectly
[05:59:18] <Northwoods> its weired though
[05:59:32] <Cork> Northwoods: prob cause the server had problems coping with the requests
[05:59:45] <Northwoods> Cork, could be
[06:12:29] <AdamPDotty> sounds like a feature to me
[06:13:21] <AdamPDotty> What if I want to get rid of the suggestions? I press backspace.
[06:22:24] <Northwoods> AdamPDotty, the issue was if i backspace and re-type , suggestions won't load at all
[06:22:32] <Northwoods> but its sorted now
[06:44:42] <obiOne> hello everyone
[08:27:31] <ghjklghjkl> How to detect a click everywhere except #mydiv or any of its descendants?
[08:29:18] <Cork> $(document).on('click', function(event) { if($(event.target).closest('#mydiv').length > 0) { return } /* not clicking on #mydiv */  })
[08:30:01] <Woet> ghjklghjkl: next time, googling "jquery detect click everywhere except" would help
[08:30:30] <ghjklghjkl> Woet: I did, but i found lots of not-so-good things
[08:30:48] <Woet> ghjklghjkl: i mean, the first result is pretty much identical to what Cork said
[08:30:55] <Woet> ghjklghjkl: what does "not-so-good" mean?
[08:32:28] <ghjklghjkl> i have closed the tabs now, but not so beautiful solutions of 10 or 15 lines
[08:32:47] <Woet> ghjklghjkl: why is the line count relevant?
[08:33:07] <Woet> (never mind the fact all my google results are like 5 lines at the most)
[08:33:14] <ghjklghjkl> Because when you can do it in 1 or 2 lines, obviously doing things involving a loop etc. in 10 lines is not optimal.
[08:33:26] <ghjklghjkl> Anyway
[08:33:44] <Woet> yea, but having multiple lines doesn't imply bad code.
[08:33:52] <ghjklghjkl> sure
[08:34:01] <Woet> you could just say "the solutions were overly complicated using needless loops", in which case i agree :)
[08:34:11] <ghjklghjkl> That's it :)
[08:34:13] <Woet> anyways, this is my first result: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12661797/jquery-click-anywhere-in-the-page-except-on-1-div
[08:34:25] <Woet> you can see they're pretty much identical to what Cork said
[08:34:42] <ghjklghjkl> yep
[08:34:54] <ghjklghjkl> Cork would you also use this solution with stopPropagation https://stackoverflow.com/a/12661812/1422096?
[08:35:08] <ghjklghjkl> or would you use prefer the closest(...) solution?
[08:36:52] <Woet> ghjklghjkl: see the comments on that answer
[08:38:32] <Cork> ghjklghjkl: no you should avoid stopPropagation
[08:38:59] <Cork> if you use stopPropagation you state "i know nothing this page will ever do in the future needs this event"
[08:39:07] <Cork> and that is a VERY large statement to make
[08:39:15] <Cork> (hence it is better not to kill events)
[08:46:30] <braindead__> hello there. i want to hide the "from - to" field if the radio selector shows "no" and only show it when it says "yes". https://jsfiddle.net/6ubs78L2/14/ ... is this possible with jquery?
[08:51:15] <Cork> braindead__: https://jsfiddle.net/6ubs78L2/19/
[08:51:29] <Cork> you want to fix the selector when you don't have templating in the html though
[08:51:47] <Cork> as that selector is extremely wide
[08:52:17] <braindead__> whuuud?.. awesome Cork - thats exactly what i am looking for. thanks a ton
[08:52:59] <braindead__> what you mean by fix the selector? (sry, noob)
[08:53:27] <Cork> input[type="radio"]
[08:53:35] <Cork> it matches any input of type radio
[08:53:43] <Cork> you don't want a selector that wide
[08:53:52] <Cork> when you have real classes/ids on those inputs use those
[08:54:05] <Cork> (or name="")
[08:54:09] <braindead__> ok, got you
[08:55:11] <braindead__> could i use this part of the radio button? name="teilnehmer-uebernachtung-{{repeater}}-{{index}}
[08:55:25] <Cork> ya, except you neded the after templating version
[08:56:10] <Cork> alternatively if you have the inputs grouped somehow (that isn't in the jsfiddle) you could use that
[09:45:22] <tilerendering> ever done form validation in multi-tabbed forms? what s best to signal the user a validation error in another tab? what s best practice ? thankful for any link on that
[09:46:11] <Cork> tilerendering: for multi section forms best practise is to group fields that can cause validation errors in each other on the same section
[09:46:22] <Cork> and do validation for each section as you change
[09:47:22] <Cork> (though this is more ui rules then coding rules so kinda the wrong channel)
[09:53:12] <tilerendering> Cork: in this form, there s a tab with contact information, one for password renewal and one for all “about me” related information. all 3 tabs belong to the same form, however when one tab is visible the others arent. the user alerted on missing/erroneous input directly while typing, but still: imagine he s in another tab and presses submit - how will he know or be signalled that the error is in the tab not visible at the moment, is there a
[09:53:14] <tilerendering> best practice
[09:53:19] <tilerendering> or some code somewhere?
[10:07:07] <tilerendering> wow this is strange....
[10:07:16] <jordansz> hello everyone, how would i read the contents of an url with jquery?
[10:07:40] <Woet> jordansz: you use AJAX, assuming it's not cross-domain or you have it set up accordingly
[10:07:43] <jordansz> i hava localhost:4567 server that throws back some data how would i read it correctly with jquery? i tried jQuery.get('file.txt', function(data) { but that throws an expension
[10:07:56] <jordansz> its all localhost Woet
[10:08:06] <tilerendering> with jquery validation plugin, the fields are correctly validated… but when I activate another tab of the same form, $(‘#identifiedfield’).valid() suddenly returns “true” even though the value of the (now hidden) field is still the same
[10:08:10] <Woet> jordansz: what is the exception?
[10:08:14] <jordansz> although i have some part in puppeteer chrome session and other in local js file but assume that would not be a problem
[10:08:24] <Woet> jordansz: different port is considered cross domain
[10:09:03] <jordansz> i had an xrmhttp request object but that dident work
[10:09:06] <jordansz> now i try like https://gist.github.com/voordev/11e9b7923a732b3c6928ec6a895e9d3b
[10:09:18] <Woet> jordansz: different port is considered cross domain
[10:09:25] <jordansz> my file.js should only load from single webserver
[10:09:42] <jordansz> but i have no idea how i could get the contents of http://localhost:4567 inside a variable
[10:10:00] <Woet> ok i'll wait until you read my message
[10:10:17] <jordansz> i tried https://gist.github.com/voordev/8025e650e8b3fab2d16a88e59caed75d line 3 starting
[10:10:29] <jordansz> that should be possible right?
[10:10:52] * Woet twiddles his thumbs
[10:11:13] <jordansz> you mean non port 80 is cross domain also?
[10:11:18] <jordansz> it has to be port 80?
[10:11:42] <Woet> a different port than the request the AJAX is running on is considered cross domain
[10:11:55] <Woet> something that the exception (which I asked you for 5 minutes ago) should tell you.
[10:12:01] <jordansz> the javascript runs locally woet, not on a server
[10:12:12] <jordansz> i run it from a local index.html
[10:12:29] <jordansz> then i want to get the contents of the localhost:4567 inside a variable
[10:12:33] <Woet> jordansz: and does that index.html run on port 4567?
[10:12:35] <jordansz> thats all basically
[10:12:52] <jordansz> Woet  no it does not i run it from the browser ( non server )
[10:13:00] <Woet> jordansz: so, as mentioned countless times, it's cross domain.
[10:13:04] <jordansz> so that would also not owork ;p
[10:13:17] <jordansz> is there a workaround? its locally on my own machine.. can i disable secrity or make it work?
[10:13:32] <Woet> what does the exception say?
[10:24:50] <dimi1947> I want to get the value of a name attribute...how can I do this?I thought attr() would help...aby ideas...it must be something simple.,ny mind is stuck though
[10:25:26] <Cork> dimi1947: uh .attr('the name') ?
[10:26:04] <dimi1947> Cork:I tried that...https://jsfiddle.net/fiddlehunt/08a25jnc/13/
[10:26:59] <Cork> you don't have any .service class
[10:27:20] <Cork> (you do have a .services though)
[10:28:25] <dimi1947> yes that typo caused the problem...thx for seeing it in the first place
[10:28:28] <webbb> hi
[10:28:44] <webbb> I am looking for something that either already does this or some components that could be used together
[10:29:06] <webbb> So a calendar (header row for days, left column for e.g. persons) and each day should be selectable as a checkbox
[10:29:10] <webbb> or at least toggable to something
[10:29:16] <webbb> what canI re-use for this? :)
[10:41:45] <braindead__> Cork: you helped me out with a jquery script some hours ago. you told me i could specify the fields by name. now i know the names but unsure how to place it
[10:42:24] <Cork> braindead__: replace "type" in the selector with "name" and the name in the ""
[10:43:03] <hakerx1> aha
[10:43:58] <braindead__> cork, they are getting named like 0-1, 0-2 etc. i posted it here at the html bottom. could i use that somehow clever or should i add like 10 of them with the names?
[10:44:25] <Cork> braindead__: do you have multiple of them?
[10:45:06] <braindead__> unlimited but i guess it shouldnt be more than 10. the user can add as many as he likes
[10:45:16] <Cork> so yes
[10:45:24] <Cork> are they grouped with what they should hide?
[10:45:25] <hakerx1> sounds like dynamic fields
[10:45:25] <braindead__> yes
[10:45:53] <Cork> do you have a parent element wrapping both of them?
[10:45:53] <braindead__> that yes was refering to the first one.. let me check the grouped thing
[10:47:19] <braindead__> they are inside a div if that helps
[10:48:04] <braindead__> may i pm you a link?
[10:51:01] <Cork> i don't have time, if you have a fiddle showing the grouping i could have a look there
[10:51:13] <Cork> (or someone else in here)
[10:51:20] <RabSimpson> Hi folks, could anyone recommend a simple but responsive image carousel which displays multiple slides at once but moves one slide at a time?
[10:52:05] <braindead__> all right
[10:52:25] <braindead__> so grouping could be a div, right?
[10:52:37] <Cork> braindead__: sure
[10:52:48] <Cork> as long as it isn't more then one set in each div
[10:52:56] <braindead__> yes thats given
[10:53:13] <braindead__> one of that radio button named like mentioned
[10:53:14] <Cork> would recommend giving the div a static class
[10:54:08] <braindead__> the got that. all of them are "wpcf7-repeater-item"
[10:54:42] <Cork> you need to replace the id "hide-this"
[10:54:48] <Cork> it needs to be a class too
[10:55:24] <Cork> then you could do something like $(document).on('change', '.wpcf7-repeater-item input[type="radio"]', function() { $(this).closest('.wpcf7-repeater-item').find('.hide-this').toggle(this.value == 'Ja'); });
[10:58:15] <braindead__> its working in the fiddle. will try to adopt it. thanks again Cork
[10:59:57] <braindead__> but as soon as i add a second one, its broken
[11:00:02] <braindead__> https://jsfiddle.net/6ubs78L2/31/
[11:00:26] <hakerx1> whats the bug ?
[11:00:37] <braindead__> sorry. no, its working
[11:01:18] <hakerx1> only small bug
[11:01:32] <hakerx1> at first one it's not defined when loaded and showing.
[11:03:16] <electriX`> any place for possible freelancers? trying to fix a no conflict issue
[11:03:44] <electriX`> with a site that uses 1.4.4 and a menu that requires 1.11.1
[11:03:45] <electriX`> :\
[11:04:02] <braindead__> perfect. thanks all
[11:04:14] <Tom2003> Hi - I have this 'tooltip' working (see the bottom of the page), but how can I make it work if someone clicks an orange box? https://jsfiddle.net/wcporzo2/

[11:06:04] <tilerendering> I want to store a reference to this validator in a variable. unforunately the =“” at the end tells javascript to set the variable to “” … https://jsfiddle.net/e6f6x5pa/
[11:06:55] <Cork> tilerendering: so move settings.ignore = "" to be run on the variable
[11:07:07] <tilerendering> Cork: hm
[11:07:50] <Tom2003> It seems to be easy, but SVG seems to complicate things
[11:09:00] <tilerendering> cork: you saved me
[11:09:06] <tilerendering> thanks!
[11:09:26] <Cork> Tom2003: ya, svg 1.x isn't html so you get a lot of problem there
[11:11:18] <Tom2003> yup, haven't been able to make it work :/
[11:12:57] <hakerx1> hmm
[11:16:20] <hakerx1> Tom2003 add id to id and work from there on :)
[11:16:25] <hakerx1> jquery basic concepts :)
[11:16:40] <hakerx1> woops add id to blocks of svg
[11:17:02] <hakerx1> where on manupilate the dom.
[11:18:23] <Tom2003> The block of SVG has an id="group_orange"
[11:18:41] <hakerx1> each block is special :)
[11:19:03] <electriX`> Is there any way to fix this script to use jQuery 1.4.4? http://bit.ly/2Inq0kh -- It's supposed to drop down. It was built with 1.11.1 and works with that library, but some other elements on this site use 1.4.4 so loading the menu breaks other parts of the site. I've tried no conflict but can't seem to get that to work while allowing the dropdown hovers to still work.
[11:19:38] <electriX`> seems to have a bootstrap.js conflict without 1.11.1 loaded
[11:20:01] <hakerx1> that happens time to make custom code to fix bug :)
[13:02:41] <skizzy> why can't i assign a handler like $("#id").on in side of a classes init function? It seems out of scope and only works on .onload or something?
[13:03:01] <skizzy> I need to reword that question I think
[13:03:01] <robertmaxrees> got an example?
[13:03:11] <robertmaxrees> are you dynamically creating that element?
[13:03:50] <skizzy> No it's made in html it's a button i am testing. I have a method attached to an object.init() in it i have the .on click hander
[13:04:02] <robertmaxrees> does the element exist at the time you bind it?
[13:04:20] <skizzy> It should. Maybe not though. I have the js in the header
[13:04:30] <skizzy> so it's above the html in the html file if you mean that
[13:04:35] <robertmaxrees> i'd wrap your stuff in a doct ready or stick it in the footer.
[13:04:45] <skizzy> it works on doc ready
[13:04:52] <robertmaxrees> then yeah.
[13:04:54] <robertmaxrees> that's your issue.
[13:04:55] <skizzy> I am just wondering why I can't do it somewhere else. seems out of scope
[13:05:13] <robertmaxrees> if the element doesn't exist yet, you can't access it.
[13:05:28] <robertmaxrees> not a scoping issue.
[13:05:36] <robertmaxrees> plain ol' "object doesn't exist yet" issue.
[13:05:39] <skizzy> ok so since the js just loads at the top and it's not in doc ready it doesn't exist to it yet
[13:05:55] <robertmaxrees> right.
[13:08:16] <skizzy> yeah just moving the script that contains the hander assignment into the end of body fixed it
[13:08:22] <skizzy> so I guess I understand that now
[14:38:04] <taplar> hey, they fixed the log files
[14:38:17] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[14:38:29] <taplar> the log files stopped logging since last wednesday
[14:38:41] <robertmaxrees> oh.  weird.
[14:38:58] <taplar> i put something in jquery-content but didn't get a response that i'm aware of
[14:42:22] <robertmaxrees> could always check the logs ;)
[14:42:52] <taplar> you cut me
[14:44:50] <robertmaxrees> #savage
[14:44:56] <taplar> lol
[15:21:59] <nakka> Hello, I have a weird issue. I have a browser addon and one specific page, $(window).keydown fails to detect pressed key if the page has loaded, if you press it before the page loaded it works. really strange, any ideas ?
[15:29:03] <mark721> hi guys
[15:29:46] <mark721> According to the api `closest` returns one or zero elements. However, i did $('.property-value-Name').closest('li')
[15:29:57] <mark721> and it is returning 4 elements how?
[15:30:23] <taplar> how many elements are matched on the first selector?
[15:30:56] <mark721> 4
[15:31:03] <taplar> :)
[15:31:26] <taplar> most jQuery.fn methods perform an implicit each
[15:31:37] <mark721> im new to jquery so u need to explain a bit more :)
[15:31:57] <taplar> Most methods when you perform a $(selector).method will perform that method on each element found
[15:32:06] <taplar> with a few exceptions
[15:32:32] <mark721> OMGAWD
[15:32:42] <mark721> no wait
[15:32:49] <taplar> so closest() does indeed return 1, but it returns one per element
[15:34:34] <mark721> ah i get u :)
[15:38:03] <mark721> in jquery is there a way to say hide everything but this
[15:40:04] <taplar> $(selector).not(this).doStuff
[15:40:25] <taplar> or
[15:40:56] <taplar> $(selector).filter(function(){ return //true for elements that should not be excluded; }).doStuff;
[15:41:54] <mark721> i will try both and report back ty :)
[15:43:09] <mark721> $(this).parents().not(this).hide();
[15:43:20] <mark721> was a bad idea LOL, it literally just hid everything
[15:43:26] <taplar> you could, but it wouldn't do anything
[15:43:32] <taplar> as a 'this' cannot be a parent of itself
[15:43:54] <taplar> whole dom tree and everything
[15:47:29] <mark721> let me give u some context
[15:47:37] <mark721> i have some `li`s
[15:47:47] <mark721> when click on one, i want to hide all, but the one i clicked on
[15:48:12] <taplar> sure, that's doable
[15:48:32] <taplar> try to do it in a jsfiddle.net and see how far you can get.  if you have an issue share it with us
[15:49:23] <mark721> $(this).closest('li').hide();
[15:49:23] <mark721>  $(this).show();
[15:49:32] <mark721> that ended up hiding the one i wanted.
[15:50:02] <taplar> what is 'this'?
[15:50:24] <mark721> its a div
[15:50:27] <mark721> inside the li
[15:50:40] <mark721> (don't ask why lol)
[15:51:23] <taplar> var $li = $(this).closest('li');  $li.closest('ul').find('li').not($li).hide();
[15:52:09] <mark721> u sir are a legend
[15:52:11] <mark721> :)
[15:52:12] <mark721> ty
[15:52:51] <mark721> is $li a jquery object or is it just something u named it?
[15:53:06] <mark721> edit wrong question
[15:53:10] <mark721> nvm
[15:53:18] <taplar> it's boyth
[15:53:22] <taplar> *both
[15:53:40] <mark721> what i meant was, odd choice of name $li
[15:54:01] <taplar> some people name variables that will contain jQuery object to have a $ at the front
[15:54:06] <mark721> OH #TIL
[17:06:12] <braindead__> hello there
[17:06:22] <taplar> kon'nichiwa
[17:06:32] <braindead__> with the help of you guys i made up this code: https://jsfiddle.net/6ubs78L2/47/
[17:07:05] <braindead__> the aim is to hide the fields when the radio button of "should we book a hotel" is set to "no"
[17:08:24] <braindead__> its working but if there is a second radio button inside the div (transport) this will trigger the hide as well. can i specify the jquery code to only effect the name "teilnehmer-uebernachtung-x-x" where x is a number counting up
[17:09:07] <braindead__> i could also wrap it inside another div or something if that would help
[17:09:34] <taplar> can you update the html to match the situation you are trying to handle for
[17:13:34] <braindead__> it is already taplar .. i tried to make it more clear https://jsfiddle.net/6ubs78L2/53/
[17:14:08] <braindead__> if you click on "no" in the first container you see the field below is hidden
[17:14:25] <taplar> yep
[17:14:40] <braindead__> but the second container is not effected, which is correct
[17:15:06] <braindead__> but if you click on "transport" and set it to "no", it also hides the field which is wrong
[17:15:36] <braindead__> i only want the field to hide when clicked on "no, dont book a hotel"
[17:15:49] <braindead__> do you get what i mean?
[17:16:02] <taplar> i would stick a class on the radios for the ones that you do want it to work on
[17:16:05] <taplar> and add that to your selector
[17:16:44] <taplar> '.wpcf7-repeater-item input[type="radio"]' would be come '.wpcf7-repeater-item .class-you-want-to-use'
[17:19:41] <braindead__> could you modify the code. i tried but i am doing something wrong
[17:20:22] <Gh0st_Preacher> show us what you tried.
[17:20:31] <taplar> one sec, i have to format this html
[17:20:35] <taplar> it's driving me crazy
[17:21:03] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/6ubs78L2/61/
[17:21:03] <robertmaxrees> taplar - https://jsfiddle.net/6ubs78L2/62/ ;)
[17:21:05] <robertmaxrees> formatted for you
[17:21:21] <taplar> i had to stick it in vscode.  for some reason the jsfiddle tidy isn't working for me
[17:21:52] <taplar> anyway, ok, braindead__ which radio's do you want this logic to work on?
[17:22:20] <taplar> which ever ones you do want it to work on, put a class on them
[17:22:30] <taplar> whatever class you want
[17:22:46] <braindead__> in the "first container" there are two radio buttons. i want to hide the two text fields when the first radio (should we book a hotel) is set to "no"
[17:23:01] <taplar> right, so stick a class on them
[17:27:56] <braindead__> like this? i added class "test"
[17:27:58] <braindead__> https://jsfiddle.net/6ubs78L2/69/
[17:28:21] <taplar> no, on the radio button itself
[17:29:23] <taplar> though that could work too
[17:29:50] <taplar> however putting it on the radio button will simplify the selector
[17:30:11] <braindead__> https://jsfiddle.net/6ubs78L2/72/
[17:30:44] <taplar> alright, so now try changing your delegate binder to use the child selector of '.test'
[17:31:33] <braindead__> awesome :) .. thanks https://jsfiddle.net/6ubs78L2/74/
[17:31:46] <taplar> and now rename 'test' to something that makes more sense, :)
[17:33:16] <braindead__> that worked pretty well. i just hope i can set a class for the radio button itself in contact form 7
[17:37:50] <braindead__> just tested it. the class will be added at line 9. lets hope this works as well
[17:42:34] <braindead__> because i can not add a class to the radio itself i needed to add it to the span class. its working to hide them but they dont show up again. https://jsfiddle.net/6ubs78L2/85/
[17:43:03] <taplar> what do you mean you can't add them to the radio?
[17:43:28] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/6ubs78L2/87/
[17:43:29] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[17:44:34] <robertmaxrees> braindead__ see the issue?
[17:44:43] <braindead__> i am using wordpress and there is a contact form builder that allows only something like this: [radio teilnehmer-uebernachtung class:hotel use_label_element default:1 "yes" "no"]
[17:45:16] <braindead__> not yes robertmaxrees .. give me a second
[17:46:30] <braindead__> i  cant find what you changed or hint me to
[17:47:00] <taplar> console.log
[17:52:38] <braindead__> undefined but what?
[17:52:51] <taplar> what is 'this' in that handler?
[17:55:40] <braindead__> .wpcf7-repeater-item .hotel? ok that dont exist
[17:55:52] <taplar> it does exist
[17:56:02] <taplar> but it's a span
[17:56:05] <taplar> span's don't have values
[17:57:15] <braindead__> so what could i do? i am so sorry but i really have just no clue
[17:57:37] <taplar> you were finding the radio button.  now you are finding a parent span of that radio button
[17:57:49] <taplar> so you need to ....
[18:02:19] <braindead__> i feel dumb but to be fair i never had anything to do with js so i am really just trying to read it by logic but i am failing. its to uch i dont know. please give me another hint
[18:03:50] <braindead__> .. adress the parent span?
[18:04:38] <taplar> if you have the parent span, and you want the child radio, find it, :)
[18:04:42] <braindead__> or adress the childs of that parent
[18:08:15] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/6ubs78L2/93/  you can also just add the radio to the child selector
[18:08:28] <taplar> since your hotel class is on the span that narrows down which radio buttons this should work on
[18:08:53] <braindead__> ok, i never had guessed that :
[18:09:04] <braindead__> i tried .find('wpcf7-list-item') and sh*t like that
[18:09:16] <taplar> another way would be ...
[18:10:00] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/6ubs78L2/95/
[18:10:11] <taplar> to find the nested radio that is checked
[18:10:52] <taplar> find('wpcf7-list-item') would not work as that is not a valid selector.  It's missing a '.' or a '#' on the start to make it a valid selector
[18:11:07] <braindead__> it was just a shot in the blue
[18:11:22] <taplar> are you familiar with css selectors?
[18:12:36] <braindead__> i should i guess .. by far no expert but in css its easier to get results
[18:13:11] <taplar> i'd suggest giving a google for css selectors.  They are pretty much a one to one for available jquery selectors.
[18:13:15] <taplar> jquery has some extras though
[18:16:03] <braindead__> i should dig into it
[18:16:36] <braindead__> but you know it.. so much to learn, so less time
[18:17:04] <braindead__> once you start reading into one thing you could focus on that for months
[18:17:25] <braindead__> but nevertheless - thanks a ton taplar and all other guys that helped me put this together
[18:17:48] <braindead__> i try to understand it and highly appreciate that you took your time
[18:18:29] <taplar> all good.  that's why the room is here
[18:18:53] <braindead__> time to shut down now. over and out
[18:19:16] <taplar> better than under and in i suppose.
[18:19:20] * taplar eyes braindead
[18:19:43] <taplar> aww he already left
[18:19:50] <hakerx1> :D
[18:20:06] * hakerx1 tired long long day hard bug fixes ...
[18:21:23] <taplar> such is life, :)
[18:23:50] <hakerx1> yep :)
[18:58:25] <taplar> you think they'll kick me out of the room if i.... ohhh f
[19:01:10] <Audlex> how do i get the first array in an array of arrays?
[19:02:08] <hakerx1> rftm :D
[19:03:59] <Audlex> it baffles me. i use grep to do a search then it returns a few arrays, where, say, the first key is 1 so $results[0] doesn't work
[19:04:23] <Audlex> sorry, no jquery pro obviously. been trying various search terms for a while now.
[19:31:44] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[19:31:48] <robertmaxrees> heh
