[07:54:11] <d[10]> anyone know jQuery Datatable?
[16:49:55] <dhecar> Hello, whats the way to interact with elements that belongs to SVG included in the DOM??  I can't change the color of rect element....
[16:52:18] <taplar> got a fiddle?  afaik you should be able to target svg elements
[16:55:17] <robertmaxrees> iirc svg and jquery don't get along very well
[16:58:15] <taplar> http://jsfiddle.net/tnhqsdcz/  seems to work ok
[17:00:06] <robertmaxrees> just no guarantees heh
[17:10:25] <dhecar> taplar: hi, I can't http://jsfiddle.net/9zmdfLkg/
[17:11:15] <taplar> http://jsfiddle.net/9zmdfLkg/1/
[17:11:35] <taplar> first, you were missing jQuery include.  Second, your selector had $ in it instead of #
[17:11:48] <taplar> and you're fill is in your style attribute, so css() changes that
[17:12:09] <dhecar> juurrrlrl
[17:12:12] <dhecar> ok thanks
[20:45:31] <creamme> https://jsfiddle.net/jengert/496wgaLj/  My code is triggered on a reload but not on first load
[22:01:30] <creamme> in hopes it helps someone else the solution was $(document).on("turbolinks:load", ready);
[22:01:54] <creamme> Good night!
