[02:45:01] <UnfixedSNIPERJ> Hey guys, I have a script that allows users to use .selectable on table rows. Is there a way that when I use .draggable instead of dragging all of the rows it drags a different css element that is hidden until dragged?
[03:00:05] <Alex______> Hi everyone!
[03:00:54] <Alex______> Does anyone know how to detect 2 classname and have an if else for them?
[03:01:26] <Alex______> For instance,
[03:01:27] <Alex______> <div class="page1 active"></div>
[03:01:28] <Alex______> <div class="page2"></div>
[03:01:29] <Alex______> If the user goes to page2, it will be
[03:01:30] <Alex______> <div class="page1"></div>
[03:01:31] <Alex______> <div class="page2 active"></div>
[06:16:29] <kulelu88> hello all. How do I add some text to the start of a localstorage item ?
[06:19:26] <Uhkis> just get it and reset it
[06:34:38] <kulelu88> Uhkis: this is what I tried: https://pastee.org/fvfje (please see my edited code at the bottom)
[06:35:44] <Uhkis> kulelu88: you forgot the keyname
[06:36:00] <kulelu88> where? Uhkis
[06:36:07] <Uhkis> kulelu88: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Storage/setItem
[06:37:24] <kulelu88> can it be like this: localStorage.setItem(parentId,"x " + parentId); ? Uhkis
[06:38:09] <Uhkis> that's the correct syntax, yes
[06:42:35] <kulelu88> doesn't seem to work Uhkis
[06:47:42] <daslicht> https://github.com/metafizzy/flickity/issues/377
[06:48:01] <Uhkis> kulelu88: make a fiddle
[07:02:00] <kulelu88> Uhkis: https://jsfiddle.net/1r5c3oeu/10/ - I tried that latest option from a SO question
[07:07:04] <kulelu88> as I understand, using get and set is better though
[07:07:18] <Uhkis> kulelu88: so what's supposed to happen here
[07:07:38] <kulelu88> Uhkis: when you click on the 'tick', it adds an 'x' to the start of the item
[07:08:35] <kulelu88> it doesn't seem to be doing that
[07:09:20] <Uhkis> so this was not about localstorage at all
[07:10:30] <kulelu88> well it kind of is, because I need to access the item, add an 'x' to the start of it
[07:16:26] <Uhkis> https://jsfiddle.net/1r5c3oeu/11/ like this?
[07:17:58] <Uhkis> oops
[07:18:38] <Uhkis> https://jsfiddle.net/1r5c3oeu/13/
[07:20:10] <kulelu88> wow, that worked excellent thank you Uhkis
[07:20:40] <kulelu88> just 1 question. can you explain what this does: $this.prev().text(newText); ?
[07:20:51] <Aamir> lets say I have three fields one is required city second requires state and the third one is required zip code so i want to fill zipcode automatically when city and states are filled? any idea how can i do that?
[07:21:23] <Uhkis> kulelu88: prev() selects the previous element and text() sets the new text
[07:22:10] <kulelu88> Uhkis: which previous element? (apologies if i'm sounding noobish)
[07:22:47] <Uhkis> kulelu88: it's the <a class="editable ui-btn"> before it
[07:22:59] <Uhkis> which holds the todo items text
[07:23:51] <kulelu88> Uhkis: removing that will break the functionality right/
[07:26:53] <Uhkis> well then it just doesnt change the text
[07:32:46] <kulelu88> Uhkis: it saves the X, but when I refresh, the x is gone. also, my console gives this error: ReferenceError: nextText is not defined
[07:33:08] <Uhkis> kulelu88: youre on the wrong fiddle
[07:33:44] <Uhkis> kulelu88: the 13 one has that brainfart fixed
[07:36:23] <kulelu88> thanks Uhkis
[09:19:50] <Pingula_pin> would this work??: $('name="todoName"')
[09:25:57] <Pingula2> would this work??: $('name="todoName"')
[09:33:00] <jerit> Pingula2 $('#todoName') will work if the element has "todoName" as the value for its "id" attribute
[09:41:01] <Uhkis> Pingula2: $('[name="todoName"]') should work fine
[09:44:35] <jerit> Uhkis I didn't actually think of that to be honest
[10:05:34] <replicator> hi
[10:08:39] <replicator> https://jsfiddle.net/fvLpnxcd/ so when first time board run, i can click cell and change color, but after press start button i can't
[10:14:32] <replicator> anyone?
[10:29:50] <SuperRoach> Given a returned xml in a .ajax statement, how would I select the tagname of it's root? (The foo: <foo><insidecontent></insidecontent></foo>  ) I tried $(data).find(":first").nodeName   and get undefined.
[12:04:40] <sbs> hi
[12:05:13] <sbs> I am new at all this and I have trouble with keyboard/mouse management conflicting between jqueryUI and openlayers
[12:05:34] <sbs> is there a tuto somewhere explaining how to handle those together properly?
[14:22:06] <realnot> hi guys, i'm using load() http://dpaste.com/0226G56 but i don't understand the behavior
[14:23:14] <realnot> the DOM has 2 id "content" one with the attribute style:"display:block"
[14:23:21] <realnot> why this happen?
[14:25:58] <decx> id > identifier > a unique number or name to..  identify an element
[14:34:21] <realnot> decx: but i need to replace the element <section id="content" ,,, > with <section id="content" class="bg-cyan"> and its childs
[14:34:53] <realnot> proably with the load i can't achieve this, because looks like the loa() creates a new DIV
[14:35:50] <arc_> load replaces the inner html with whatever you are loading in
[14:36:19] <arc_> it does not replace the node you are running the method on
[14:36:53] <realnot> ok
[14:36:54] <Cork> realnot: ya, you would have to use ajax and $().replace()
[14:37:06] <Cork> opps replaceWith
[14:38:09] <Cork> realnot: alternatively you could change what the server sends so the #content element isn't included
[14:38:35] <Cork> .load('url #content *') is another but less good option
[14:39:39] <arc_> i didn't even know you could select part of the contents of a url like that
[14:40:12] <arc_> interesting
[14:40:16] <Cork> you can't normally, but .load splits everything after the first space into a selector
[14:40:25] <arc_> oic
[14:40:59] <Cork> i personally don't like those solutions, its hacky
[14:41:12] <Cork> but if you can't correct the server data it is a workaround
[18:05:10] <realnot> Cork, arc_: thanks!
[18:05:23] <realnot> it works
[22:36:36] <spoonUltra> Am I taking the wrong approach to this? http://codepen.io/anon/pen/VaNKBP?editors=1111
[22:54:27] <smgs> hi. is there anyway for a alert/popup et. al. to stay for a say like 5 seconds ?
[23:06:06] <D-rex> smgs: not with alert()...use a custom modal and you can
[23:06:40] <smgs> $( ".header" ).dialog({ "/n"   hide: { effect: "fadeOut", duration: 1000 } "/n" });
