[05:17:37] <Rockwood> hi
[05:17:41] <Rockwood> any active?
[05:19:00] <Rockwood> i wanna use get and post method like switch in $.ajax is possible?
[06:09:01] <baako> hi guys, i need some help please.
[06:09:12] <Rockwood> what happens?
[06:09:19] <baako> https://jsfiddle.net/baako/hc0e1gaL/8/ I have left some notes in the javascript section
[06:09:59] <Rockwood> lol
[06:10:03] <baako> basically what I want to do is do some calculation and update those fields as the user enters the
[06:10:34] <baako> values in the subject score or modifier
[06:10:53] <baako> the bit i need help with
[06:11:16] <baako> that calculate 1 and calculate 2 are seperate,
[06:11:54] <baako> so if a user enters values in subject score for that calculation 1 section for example
[06:12:17] <baako> it needs to only  do the calculation for things related to that section
[06:20:59] <Rockwood> you need arithmetical operators just
[06:21:23] <baako> actually dont matter will do it using c# and sent the result and js will just fill it in
[06:21:25] <Rockwood> just use identifiers and do as you want
[07:03:02] <Cork> Rockwood: what do you mean by "like switch"?
[07:03:41] <Rockwood> i wanna change method as per request type
[07:03:54] <Rockwood> method means get or post
[07:04:03] <Cork> ah, you mean for the success callback?
[07:05:39] <Rockwood> Cork, https://paste.ofcode.org/xGAnZh9hAkKuFz4aEhh7xB
[07:06:29] <Cork> what is that meant to tell me?
[07:06:47] <Rockwood> Cork, https://paste.ofcode.org/AJBb2MEBEP3dVjVTk8n7NP
[07:07:12] <Rockwood> i wanna use common ajax function for multiple events
[07:07:31] <Rockwood> and event will be decide the methods \
[07:08:03] <Cork> so you want different .done callbacks based on what method was used?
[07:09:07] <Rockwood> yes
[07:09:17] <Rockwood> i wanna that is
[07:09:50] <Rockwood> but i am confuse in how to switch in method in between the ajax
[07:10:55] <Cork> one min
[07:11:06] <Rockwood> ok
[07:15:24] <Cork> Rockwood: https://jsfiddle.net/u6vko1a7/
[07:15:46] <Cork> (method is an alias for type so it becomes type in the done callback)
[07:17:49] <Rockwood> type: 'post',
[07:18:01] <Rockwood> still the static
[07:18:08] <Cork> uh, no
[07:18:21] <Cork> if you want to set that from a variable, go ahead
[07:19:07] <Rockwood> k
[09:21:07] <baako> any idea why jquery slim 3.4.1-slim.min dont work with $.ajax or $.post? I get this message TypeError: $.post is not a function
[09:21:24] <baako> https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.4.1.slim.min.js
[09:40:31] <Woet> baako: have you checked with jQuery *slim* is?

[10:31:43] <snake-venom> hi , its very strange for that Scroll event not detecting in mobile. here is the pastie https://pastebin.com/E1SycwpE
[10:32:39] <snake-venom> https://jsfiddle.net/d4r572xa/ here is updated , ignore pastebin
[11:20:34] <Cork> snake-venom: you provide very little context so it isn't possible to tell why it doesn't work for you; that said, this works fine for me https://embed.plnkr.co/cM2SQxuTmajBjcBwdn1h/
[11:37:43] <snake-venom> Cork, can i send you my website link in PVT ?
[11:38:02] <snake-venom> also i can tell you where i added this script to get scroll event..
[11:38:16] <snake-venom> i can see your solution working but my solution still not working.
[12:15:32] <awesomeguy69> hi all, I'm looking for a jquery plugin that has a searchable option list on a table, whereas the searchable option list would be populated by the value of col1 of all rows, and upon checking/unchecking them it would show/hide respectively I've made a ugly mock up of what i'm looking for here - https://i.imgur.com/fzQHfTM.png - anyone know of such a thing? I've done some searching, but didn't have
[12:15:35] <awesomeguy69> any great luck. worst case I can frankenstein these two plugins together
[12:17:28] <robertmaxrees> awesomeguy69 that's... pretty specific heh.  no one plugin is going to do all of that.
[12:19:15] <awesomeguy69> yea, figured i'd ask- thank you for speedy response robertmaxrees :)
[14:14:01] <grid-> hey
[14:14:31] <grid-> i'm using here a part of a script that i call with an api https://jsfiddle.net/5bLtg0yf/ it starts to run at position 1, but i need it to begin on position 6 to run, can anyone help me?
[14:15:20] <robertmaxrees> so you want the counter to start on 6?
[14:15:49] <grid-> yes
[14:16:06] <robertmaxrees> well, right now the counter starts on 0.
[14:16:12] <robertmaxrees> so how do you think you'd make it start on 6?
[14:16:32] <grid-> so the first table footers will not get a text input field
[14:16:44] <grid-> well i tried to set the 0 of the first line to 5
[14:16:45] <robertmaxrees> lol
[14:16:53] <robertmaxrees> and what happened?
[14:17:26] <robertmaxrees> wait, you want to start on the 6th th?
[14:17:44] <grid-> yes
[14:18:07] <robertmaxrees> that's not the same as "i need it to begin on position 6" :)
[14:18:16] <grid-> nothing happened, it happened that it was beginning at 0 when i changed it to 0
[14:18:22] <grid-> changed it to 5 i mean
[14:18:35] <robertmaxrees> right - that doesn't change your selector though.
[14:18:40] <grid-> so when changing to 5 or 6 didn't make a change
[14:20:02] <robertmaxrees> a few different ways - i'd probably .filter() everything in $('#woonfunctietotaal tfoot th') whose index() is > 4 or w/e
[14:20:05] <grid-> robertmaxrees: how i could change it so there will be no text input fields at the first 5?
[14:20:20] <robertmaxrees> just answered ya :)
[14:20:51] <grid-> can you be specific on the jsfiddle so i can change the code with your change?
[14:20:54] <grid-> :)
[14:21:00] <robertmaxrees> var $theElementsYouWant = $('#woonfunctietotaal tfoot th').filter(function() {
[14:21:24] <robertmaxrees> in that function, return if the element's .index() is greater than 5
[14:22:37] <grid-> hmm, i don't really get the logic
[14:22:45] <robertmaxrees> where am I losing you?
[14:25:00] <grid-> i think i have a problem since this will just trigger the execution flow a couple of times, so it will start anyway at the first text input field right?
[14:25:14] <grid-> so if i choose 6 or 5
[14:25:20] <robertmaxrees> you're jumping ahead.
[14:25:22] <robertmaxrees> slow down.
[14:25:28] <robertmaxrees> and you're not understanding the issue.
[14:26:13] <robertmaxrees> the problem right now is $('#woonfunctietotaal tfoot th').each( is going to run for everything that matches that selector - you want to filter out a certain subset of elements from this.
[14:26:21] <robertmaxrees> so we need to start there.
[14:29:35] <robertmaxrees> brb
[14:30:37] <robertmaxrees> back-ish
[14:31:47] <grid-> hmm ok
[14:32:58] <grid-> https://datatables.net/forums/discussion/28077/disable-filtering-of-one-or-multiple-columns-select-inputs+&cd=5&hl=nl&ct=clnk&gl=nl
[14:33:05] <robertmaxrees> ...
[14:33:09] <grid-> i'm reading this atm
[14:33:10] <robertmaxrees> bro.

[14:54:26] <Inazad> I use the jquery component jstree. I got 2 trees. How I can do tree1.refresh() while in a function binded to the tree2 ?
[15:05:31] <robertmaxrees> back
[15:05:35] <robertmaxrees> back
[15:15:23] <robertmaxrees> grid- - i'm talkking about jquery's filter fwiw
[16:11:15] <admin123> how can I make the 2nd item from .find() into a jquery object?
[16:11:25] <robertmaxrees> what are you doing now??
[16:11:36] <admin123> I want to change the css on one of the children
[16:11:49] <robertmaxrees> i mean how are you getting the 2nd item?
[16:12:14] <admin123> so I do i = $(this).find("i")[1]; i.attr('', '')
[16:12:30] <robertmaxrees> that's why - you want .eq(1), not [1]
[16:13:27] <robertmaxrees> also: don't use attr for css.
[16:13:31] <robertmaxrees> use .css()
[16:13:32] <robertmaxrees> :)
[16:14:56] <robertmaxrees> admin123
[16:19:47] <admin123> I have two click handlers, in the first I update the class and was hoping the 2nd click handler would trigger, but the 1st one keeps triggering on subsequent clicks
[16:20:33] <robertmaxrees> can you show me in a fiddle?
[16:20:33] <admin123> the first one changes the class such that the 2nd click handler should register if it was the first page load
[16:20:44] <robertmaxrees> ah.  so that won't work that way :)
[16:20:48] <admin123> brb
[16:21:02] <robertmaxrees> you can use a pair of delegated handlers for this instead though
[16:23:04] <robertmaxrees> admin123 https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/v9c2ksyr/1/
[16:27:52] <admin123> so this doesn't work? https://jsfiddle.net/jwrof40k/
[16:27:58] <admin123> it has to be delegated?
[16:28:32] <robertmaxrees> https://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events -> "Event handlers are bound only to the currently selected elements; they must exist at the time your code makes the call to .on()."
[16:28:33] <robertmaxrees> :)
[16:29:25] <robertmaxrees> put differently, when you bind a listener via .on(), you're binding it to the DOM node you selected, not to the class.
[16:31:02] <robertmaxrees> make sense?
[16:31:31] <admin123> yes
