[10:21:26] <codecutter> Displaying a tooltip just below the link when hovered. Now need to position it so that if there is not enough space at the bottom then it would display it at the top of the link
[10:21:26] <codecutter> https://jsfiddle.net/apprentice_/o74z5dcv/30/
[10:23:09] <codecutter> If you hover over the link you should a tool tip appear below. I don't know why repeated hovering is causing the tooltip to go further down, appears to be a fiddle issue,  seems to work on my machine (can someone confirm?)
[10:29:44] <codecutter> anyone?
[11:12:20] <codecutter> Cork?
[14:19:53] <snatcher> is there a way to get active form _elements_ (inputs, selects, ...)?
[20:51:14] <Jase> does href get messed up when debugging locally in jquery? It's showing a really strange href attribute on my anchor element that I am handling with jquery
[20:58:04] <dw1> whatd you do to it
[21:27:07] <Jase> Nada. thanks for the response. Apparently PHPStorm rewrites the href attribute on testing.
[23:04:13] <shangul> Hello. Where am I wrong? https://jsfiddle.net/3cwLt6gv/
[23:08:00] <dw1> about what
[23:08:55] <dw1> oh
[23:10:53] <dw1> 	switch(e.which){
[23:10:59] <dw1> case 38:
[23:11:15] <dw1> try that
[23:11:32] <dw1> for starters
[23:12:33] <dw1> but index needs work too
[23:16:12] <dw1> add some output so you can see whats going on, like https://jsfiddle.net/4rjof6z0/1/
[23:16:17] <dw1> or console.log
[23:20:59] <shangul> dw1, Thanks. According to your fiddle and mine, it seems that index() always returns -1. Why? Isn't it supposed to return index of the focused article element in the div?
[23:21:16] <dw1> -1 means not found i guess
[23:21:20] <dw1> yea not sure why not finding
[23:22:51] <dw1> 'n my fries and chicken strips are ready brb
