[04:33:21] <AeroOP> Hey guys, anyone here?
[04:50:41] <jamesw> hi all
[04:52:05] <jamesw> on my website I am using coverflow jquery plugin, and it will listen for shortcut keys, but only after the element is clicked on. I'd like to do it on page load but I can't seem to trigger it with focus() or click(), ideas?
[04:52:33] <jamesw> by shortcut keys I meant to say arrow keys

[05:07:35] <tb_b> hi is it possible, to copy some text into clipboard with jquery native
[05:07:49] <tb_b> a link for example
[05:51:21] <flobin> if I have a jquery object that’s several items (like $(“.selector”) and there’s >1 of them), what’s the best way to loop over them? Because jquery’s each is only for arrays, right?
[05:52:13] <flobin> oh no it’s objects too
[06:00:25] <flobin> so what I’m trying to do is add the correct href value to a bunch of images
[06:00:53] <flobin> but how do you put a predefined function into $(‘.selector’).each(); ?
[06:00:54] <flobin> https://gist.github.com/Flobin/a5ace8bf2a7dd099110a
[06:17:18] <PCatinean> Can someone help me with this? It does not trigger in firefox at all but works in chrome
[06:17:20] <PCatinean> http://hastebin.com/vigeyujori.coffee
[06:17:24] <PCatinean> I'm a bit curios why
[06:18:27] <PCatinean> Console does not releave anything
[06:24:09] <PCatinean> not even the console.log hits right inside document.ready
[06:46:35] <Cork> PCatinean: and $('button.cfg_clear').length gives you?
[06:48:14] <PCatinean> Cork, I solved it, it actually hit even though the debugger; does not work, nor console.log
[06:48:23] <PCatinean> and I had to do reload(true) to force the clear cache
[07:08:42] <jonky> i have mutation observer setup that reinitializes a widget whenever an option is added to a select node. it says " $(...).foo() is not a function" which is clear, but the function does exist, it does fire, and it behaves as expected other than this TypeError. can anyone let me know what's going on?
[07:09:20] <Cork> jonky: it most likely fires more then the time your thinking of
[07:09:34] <Cork> *you're
[07:09:43] <jonky> Cork, it indeed fires twice and fails the first time
[07:10:56] <jonky> But i don't understand why it would fail one time and not the other
[07:11:43] <Cork> mutation observers are very chatty
[07:11:45] <jonky> im mostly a backend developer, so there're plenty of subtleties about javascript im unfamiliar with
[07:11:57] <Cork> so you have to filter out so you only monitor the case you want
[07:12:14] <Cork> and by filter i don't mean the string you give to the observer
[07:12:49] <jonky> right, my question though is what exactly is going on with the scope. why would it change?
[07:13:04] <Cork> noone can answer that generically
[07:15:09] <jonky> hrm..
[07:37:39] <hellyeah> yo
[07:37:43] <hellyeah> yeah i dont know it does make sense but i have an attemp to calculate width and height value of outside div and divide by length of inner div. Then give those value as width and height. Can you checjk line 548 - 567 and give me some suggesion? http://jsfiddle.net/fjcqp33u/43/
[08:29:53] <jeffreylevesque> should i install react via npm (https://facebook.github.io/react/downloads.html#npm), or individual download (https://facebook.github.io/react/downloads.html#individual-downloads)
[08:29:58] <toshin> why when i second time use .one() it's not work?
[08:34:23] <flobin> jeffreylevesque: with npm you can update it
[08:35:45] <jeffreylevesque> is that it, what do most do?  I'm thinking of just doing individual files
[08:46:25] <brk> hi, how can I select the value in all td's with class name pointer?
[08:54:45] <Cork> brk: by value you mean the content?
[08:55:29] <Cork> brk: $('td.pointer').map(function() { return $(this).text(); }).get()
[09:29:52] <zcserei> hello everyone!
[09:30:10] <zcserei> I have two spans, siblings, with the classes of yyy and zzz.
[09:30:40] <zcserei> There are zzz's on many levels, and I only want to select those which are siblings with the yyy's.
[09:30:58] <zcserei> So far, I came up with $("span.yyy + span.zzz") as a selector.
[09:31:27] <zcserei> However, when these zzz's are clicked, I'd like to add a class of xxx to them.
[09:32:37] <zcserei> How can I do that?
[09:59:14] <imox> hmm how can I change two li’s with together?
[09:59:21] <imox> in an ul
[10:38:12] <printForever> Can someone tell me what plugin/script they are using for the dropdown/tags? http://www.jobs.cz/
[10:53:20] <tb_b> hi is it possible, to copy some text into clipboard with  native  jquery
[10:53:39] <printForever> no
[10:54:36] <tb_b> which is the easiest (codeless) solution, if there is one?
[10:54:46] <printForever> Flash
[10:56:20] <Woet> https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2015/04/cut-and-copy-commands
[10:57:08] <printForever> Woet, its not fully supported by other browsers...
[10:57:30] <Woet> http://caniuse.com/#feat=clipboard
[11:00:06] <printForever> Woet...
[11:00:20] <printForever> I'm trying to replicate the dropdown from http://www.jobs.cz/
[11:00:31] <printForever> I tried using Select2 but it does not work...
[11:00:40] <printForever> does not work for what I have to do
[11:07:00] <adavia_> anyone using the jquery file upload plugin knows if its possible to bind the event to the document?
[11:21:54] <tb_b> Woet: thx for the link, but haven't found a working solution for safari on latest Safari on OS X and Firefox
[11:22:07] <tb_b> do you know a working example
[12:29:31] <rocky> does anyone have a favourite gallery style jquery plugin (something like flexslider) that has a built in upload interface (perhaps like jquery.fileupload) ?
[12:31:38] <cannap> @rocky check this one http://flickity.metafizzy.co/
[12:31:53] <cannap> or owl carousel
[12:32:27] <rocky> is there a demo someplace for flickity? not seeing on on that main url
[12:33:56] <rocky> owl carousel doesn't appear to have any sort of upload support
[12:35:17] <rocky> to be quite frank, jquery.fileupload seems way too complicated for my liking... any widget that requires 10+ js files to be included as <script>'s is a bit of a pain (yes i've set it up sucessfully)
[12:38:00] <cannap> you want a upload support?
[12:38:04] <cannap> this is more a server thing
[12:38:54] <cannap> on the client its all simple input with the type=file
[12:47:49] <def1> Hi can you point me in the right direction on how i can click a button which gets some data from the html age the button is on and creates an element in that same page
[12:48:23] <def1> page*
[12:52:07] <NoiseEee> well first thing you should know how to observe for an event (the button being clicked) def1, do you know how to do that?
[12:52:15] <cannap> check the load function
[12:52:33] <cannap> http://api.jquery.com/load/
[12:52:45] <NoiseEee> cannap: nope
[12:52:59] <cannap> ah xD
[12:53:01] <NoiseEee> cannap: def1 mentioned nothing about a remote resource
[12:53:37] <def1> NoiseEee: well im using the onClick="" html attribute
[12:53:47] <def1> cannap: Thanks i will :)
[12:53:58] <NoiseEee> def1: yeah, thats not really so appropriate for javascript in 2015 let alone 2012
[12:54:11] <NoiseEee> def1: you should be assigning event observers in the javascript, not in an html element
[12:54:27] <NoiseEee>  http://api.jquery.com/on/ @ def1
[12:56:00] <cannap> i cant use onClick or what?
[12:56:24] <cannap> it looks ugly but why not use this
[12:56:39] <def1> Okay il check that out NoiseEee Thanks :-)
[12:57:36] <NoiseEee> cannap: you should 100% not be using "onclick" for anything in 2015
[12:58:26] <cannap> and why not?
[12:58:41] <cannap> i need dont use this but i cant understand why not
[12:58:47] <cannap> i dont need to use this
[13:01:27] <NoiseEee> cannap: because thats bad practice; it makes it hard to overwrite events and it clobbers everything else
[13:01:36] <NoiseEee> cannap: use javascript to assign javascript events, not html.
[13:01:42] <cannap> yea
[13:01:52] <cannap> i jsx you can do^^
[13:01:57] <cannap> but it will generate pure js
[13:02:49] <cannap> when i do jquery stuff
[13:03:02] <cannap> i use alwayse $('selector').on('event
[13:03:07] <NoiseEee> a+
[13:03:15] <cannap> i never used $('bla').click
[13:03:28] <cannap> it had some trouble with this on mobile
[13:03:34] <cannap> i dont know but .on works always
[13:45:53] <xinming> In jquery, Is there a api to do "form" submit on the fly?
[13:46:00] <xinming> I don't mean to create form via js, and submit it.
[13:46:17] <xinming> hmm, I do mean create a form via js, and submit it. But just the api built-in with jquery
[16:38:29] <Rarikon> I have a function to move an element to the pageX, PageY coordinates using .mousemove(). But it doesn't seem to update very fast. Is there a way to increase the "polling rate"?
[17:10:58] <Xoro> Well I figured out how to do it with JS-only but it's still not as responsive as it should be.
[17:29:27] <bjensen82> Ive implemented functions to jump from input text fields using arrow keys. Works awesome, however I would like to mark the content (ctrl + a), when I am in the field, how do I do that?
[21:12:17] <Mark__> can anyone help me figure out why this js plugin isn’t working on my website? http://thdoan.github.io/magnify/
[21:12:26] <Mark__> http://lifeto.cafe24.com/xe/today#
[21:32:39] <Mark__> can anyone examine my console errors, and tell me how i can fix them? http://lifeto.cafe24.com/xe/today
[21:49:58] <printForever> Is it possible to use jquery on Select 2 to change set placeholder text once Select 2 is triggered?
[22:01:11] <printForever> guys
[22:01:14] <printForever> is anyone here?
[22:02:41] <Mark__> does anyone have an idea why this js plugin won’t apply to my website? http://jsfiddle.net/trbuzhh6/6/
