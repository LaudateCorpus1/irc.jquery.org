[02:51:27] <ThreeGenDos> Hey guys, currently having trouble with a contact page. I have javascript that grabs a form (ID is passed to the function) and it posts it to the server. It works with a desktop browser, not mobile devices, however. Any ideas? http://pastebin.com/ARQkneRf
[02:51:59] <ThreeGenDos> Mobile devices DO get a reply, but no email is sent.
[02:52:40] <Cork> ThreeGenDos: sounds like you have a problem server side then
[02:53:11] <sonu_nk> hi. i have a javascript which is in my PHP  file and that url i am calling from my local system in a test.html.. but its not  working. my javascript is not working.. http://pastebin.com/3wbWDSeY
[02:53:14] <ThreeGenDos> My hosting is done through namecheap. It is shared. I guess I could contact them and see.
[02:53:38] <sonu_nk> blank result
[02:54:22] <Cork> sonu_nk: some browsers block access to web resources from local files
[02:54:27] <Cork> might be what you're seeing
[02:54:37] <ThreeGenDos> Could it be becuase I'm not using HTTPS yet Cork? Maybe Chrome on mobile blocks it due to wifi security concerns? I don't really know how to go about debugging with my phone. :)
[02:54:38] <Cork> run a local webserver and try from that
[02:55:06] <Cork> ThreeGenDos: i don't think this has anything to do with the browser or the js
[02:55:29] <Cork> ThreeGenDos: if the request is sent and the response comes back but the server doesn't send an email it has nothing to do with client side
[02:55:35] <ThreeGenDos> sonu_nk yes I experience that, too, testing dynamic webpages. It wouldn't pull from local files. Errors were shown in Chrome's debugger, something along the lines of XMLHTTPRequest blocked or something.
[02:55:50] <ThreeGenDos> Okay cork, thanks for checking in and confirming.
[02:57:06] <sonu_nk> Cork, i tried with my localserver  but same issue ...
[02:57:10] <sonu_nk> ThreeGenDos,
[02:57:29] <Cork> sonu_nk: any errors in the browser console?
[02:57:52] <Cork> sonu_nk: also grab the generated html the browser sees and skip the php end of things
[02:58:10] <Cork> no point in making it harder by debugging two scripts at the same time
[02:58:50] <sonu_nk> Cork, SyntaxError: expected expression, got '<'[Learn More]  render_form:1
[02:58:50] <sonu_nk> The character encoding of the HTML document was not declared. The document will render with garbled text in some browser configurations if the document contains characters from outside the US-ASCII range. The character encoding of the page must be declared in the document or in the transfer protocol.
[02:59:08] <Cork> sonu_nk: ok, so pb the code you actually send the browser
[02:59:17] <sonu_nk> yes...
[02:59:43] <Cork> uh, i meant make a pastebin with the code you send, not what the server process
[03:06:49] <sonu_nk> Cork, http://pastebin.com/11mbDCnw here PB
[03:07:50] <Cork> those are not the lines throwing exceptions
[03:08:58] <sonu_nk> Cork, http://pastebin.com/Npb8ig7E
[03:09:04] <sonu_nk> this one with error
[03:09:49] <Cork> sigh... ok if you want me to help, stop cropping out the code where the problem comes from
[03:10:00] <Cork> either paste the entire html
[03:12:01] <sonu_nk> its who html
[03:12:04] <sonu_nk> its whole html
[03:12:25] <Cork> are you telling me your html contains no html at all?
[03:12:34] <Cork> no <html> no <body> no nothing?
[03:13:31] <sonu_nk> yes i have..html body tag
[03:13:36] <Cork> -_-'
[03:13:53] <Cork> then in what form is this the entire response?
[03:18:17] <sonu_nk> Cork, i think there is some confussion .may be i am not getting your words..
[03:18:21] <sonu_nk> let me explain
[03:19:02] <Cork> sonu_nk: php runs server side, when debugging client side problems it is completely irrelevant
[03:19:23] <Cork> sonu_nk: you need to grab what is rendered by php and inspect THAT for the error
[03:20:01] <Cork> and the code you have shown this far is not the cause of the error
[03:20:09] <Cork> (or the complete html page so...)
[03:29:02] <sonu_nk> Cork, i have a form builder and form builder works on javascript . and i want to put form on another page using a script ..like 	<script src="http://myswerver/render_form.php?v=7897897" type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8"></script>    and this file responsible to generate whole form on another page...
[03:29:14] <sonu_nk> wht i am doing wrong there ,, please correct me..
[03:30:00] <ThreeGenDos> You were right. Seems Google mail forwarding was rejected when sending from the mobile device. I send all emails to the server it's hosted on and all is well. Thanks, Cork.
[03:30:24] <Cork> ThreeGenDos: np
[03:30:41] <sonu_nk> form builder help us to create a form  and saves its json in database then another form builder render script works with json and create form on another page.. .
[03:30:47] <Cork> sonu_nk: again, i can't help you as long as you don't give me the part causing the problem
[03:31:58] <sonu_nk> finally i told you my current work..and now i require help from you all.. :) finally let me know wht you need from my end.. plz
[03:34:05] <sonu_nk> i just want to share this line  <script src="http://myswerver/render_form.php?v=7897897" type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8"></script> this to my users and whole form should generate on their side..
[03:37:21] <sonu_nk> Cork, :) cool senior..like this url https://nareshkumar632.activehosted.com/f/embed.php?id=7 i want to create my own script.which will behave like this..
[03:37:58] <sonu_nk> <script src="https://nareshkumar632.activehosted.com/f/embed.php?id=7" type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8"></script>
[03:38:20] <sonu_nk> they are giving this line and whole form is on screen on local system also
[03:39:54] <sonu_nk> Cork, waiting for reply.. :)
[03:40:26] <Cork> sonu_nk: i've already said what i need, before you give me that you won't get any help from me; CAUSE I CAN'T HELP YOU
[03:55:07] <woodrag> can someone tell what is the common used jquery tool to translate webpages to anpther language?
[03:55:54] <Cork> not sure if there are any, never seen one at least (though can't say i've looked for one)
[03:56:56] <woodrag> thank you
[04:03:27] <sonu_nk> Cork, nothing is hidden in this PB http://pastebin.com/Shek2Eez and i have same eveything on my side.. Wht i want to do.. i just want to share a line like   <script src="http://myapplicationurl.com/render_form.php?v=7897897" type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8"></script> and it will render whole form on client side..
[04:04:03] <sonu_nk> Wht else you need please reply
[05:27:50] <sonu_nk> just to confirm .. Is its a strong solution of jquery conflict ? ( function( $ ) {  ( function() {			//jquery Script 	})(); } )( jQuery );
[05:28:36] <Cork> that one just makes sure $ is jQuery inside the function
[05:32:11] <sonu_nk> Cork, thank you..i want to get a strong solution for jquery conflict.. becuase i dont want to make issue with other pre installed jquery lib on client side
[05:33:02] <Cork> sonu_nk: if you're making a lib to be included in other ppls sites, the solution is: not include jquery define it as a dependency
[05:33:17] <Cork> *do not*
[05:33:39] <Cork> (similar to how jquery ui requires you to load jquery)
[05:35:43] <sonu_nk> Cork, ok as per my understanding you are saying , i should not create a liab which require jquery core lib ? becuase i need to place it on ppl site.
[05:35:44] <sonu_nk> ?
[05:36:11] <Cork> no i'm saying you should not INCLUDE jquery in your lib
[05:36:36] <Cork> you should (in code) assume it exists and in documentation say it is required for the lib to work
[05:36:53] <Cork> and then the site owner can decide how this requirement should be handled
[05:37:11] <sonu_nk> ok.. there client can get a option if he want to include jquery core lib if its not on his website other wise he will not choose...
[05:37:17] <Cork> (if they need to do something to the site to allow a newer version to be loaded, or if the one they have will work and so on)
[05:37:40] <Cork> sonu_nk: eh... i would recommend not going that way
[05:38:34] <sonu_nk> Cork, yes.. got your point... but my plugin depended on core liab so it should included in page if its not included before ... :)
[05:38:42] <sonu_nk> thank you got your point...
[05:38:55] <Cork> just give them a code example like <script src="//code.jquery.com/jquery-1.12.4.js"></script><script src="yout-lib.js"></script>
[05:39:09] <sonu_nk> yes././thats my plan
[05:39:21] <Cork> and a text "jquery x.y.z or newer is required"
[05:39:36] <sonu_nk> i will not include core liab
[05:40:00] <sonu_nk> yes..leave it..got your point
[05:40:12] <sonu_nk> just i am scared from conflict issue
[05:40:38] <Cork> sonu_nk: the reason for this is i've seen sites including the same version of jquery 4 times
[05:40:49] <sonu_nk> yes..
[05:40:52] <Cork> cause each lib they depend on include there own version (and one for the site)
[05:40:58] <Cork> a silly waist of time
[05:41:14] <Cork> and as if it is bundled it can't even be cached client side so... ugg
[05:41:16] <sonu_nk> yes.. i also see lot oftime..
[05:41:41] <Cork> basically, don't over-complicate it documentation is the best solution
[05:42:09] <Cork> and today i say you can require ppl to have a 1.7 or newer jquery lib
[05:42:24] <sonu_nk> Cork,  anyway i solved my previous problem. which you asked me to repaste in pastebin. :) thankyou
[05:42:27] <Cork> and then it isn't hard to write the lib so it is compatible with all newer versions
[05:43:43] <sonu_nk> Cork,  i just wnt to know how they did means generated a form with this script <script src="https://nareshkumar632.activehosted.com/f/embed.php?id=7" type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8"></script>
[05:43:51] <sonu_nk> i tried in same way but no luck
[05:44:39] <Cork> sonu_nk: they have a big chunk of html in there js file
[05:44:51] <Cork> so they generate the from a js string inside the js file
[05:44:58] <sonu_nk> yes..checked..
[05:45:10] <Cork> can't say i care much about it after that
[05:45:20] <sonu_nk> ok.
[05:45:23] <sonu_nk> leave it.
[06:14:23] <freeclock> If I play song from Album 2, next continues from Album 1 --> http://jsfiddle.net/WsXX3/2232/
[06:23:32] <Cork> freeclock: you need to pick the playlist you want
[06:23:40] <Cork> freeclock: currently you pick from both
[06:24:30] <Cork> freeclock: i would recommend using $(this).closest('.playlist').index(this) and $(this).closest('.playlist').eq()
[06:24:48] <Cork> and scip both the current and playlist variable
[06:24:52] <Cork> *skip*
[06:26:40] <freeclock> Core Do you mean to replace playlist = $playlist with this $(this).closest('.playlist').index(this)
[06:27:06] <Cork> freeclock: in each click handler use $(this)... and never playlist
[06:27:32] <Cork> freeclock: and then keep a reference to this as "current" and use that as a reference to grab the next song
[06:28:03] <Cork> like var next = $(current).next() || $(current).siblings().first();
[06:28:53] <freeclock> Cork: Can you show me in jsfiddle?
[06:29:19] <Cork> that's quite a bit of rewrite but ok i can take some of it
[06:30:00] <freeclock> Cork: ok, thx
[06:32:23] <Cork> freeclock: http://jsfiddle.net/WsXX3/2233/
[06:32:28] <Cork> something like that (untested)
[06:32:54] <Cork> opps wrong
[06:33:40] <Cork> freeclock: http://jsfiddle.net/WsXX3/2234/
[06:34:50] <freeclock> Cork: is it possible to make it jumps to song 1 when song 4 in Album 1 is over
[06:35:03] <Cork> freeclock: it should do that
[06:35:13] <Cork> that is what the siblings().first() does
[06:36:12] <freeclock> When song 4 is finished, the player stops and not continue to song 1 in album 2
[06:37:47] <Anticom> o/
[06:43:03] <Cork> ugg silly me...
[06:43:17] <Cork> freeclock: done too much ruby and forgot that .next() returns an object -_-'
[06:43:21] <Cork> freeclock: http://jsfiddle.net/WsXX3/2236/
[06:44:51] <Cork> freeclock: and some clean up of audio http://jsfiddle.net/WsXX3/2237/
[06:46:17] <freeclock> Cork: oh, I maybe explained wrong. I ment it should goes to next song in next album after last song in album 1
[06:46:33] <Cork> oh...
[06:46:40] <Cork> ugg... -_-'
[06:46:50] <freeclock> :( sorry
[06:46:52] <Cork> that made quite a bit of what i did useless...
[06:47:07] <freeclock> No, I can use it too =)
[06:47:52] <Anticom> What's a good starting point from the fiddle revisions?
[06:48:01] <Anticom> I wanna have a go at this too :D
[06:49:19] <Cork> freeclock: like so then http://jsfiddle.net/WsXX3/2238/
[06:50:08] <Cork> freeclock: btw par is a global, you prob want to declare it
[06:50:09] <freeclock> Cork: Its the same
[06:50:34] <Cork> no it should circle all of them
[06:50:56] <freeclock> I mean when song 1,2,3,4 from Album 1 is done it will goes to Album 2 and play 1,2,3,4
[06:51:27] <Cork> ah, the run is broken
[06:51:40] <freeclock> so when last song is played in Album 1 it should start play song 1 from Album 2 =)
[06:51:45] <freeclock> Cork: ok
[06:53:00] <Anticom> freeclock: generally speaking, why don't you provide the song information via json array etc. and build your page accordingly?
[06:53:17] <Cork> freeclock: http://jsfiddle.net/WsXX3/2239/
[06:53:36] <Anticom> would make stuff so much simpler. Just stuff your song's into an array and get next using songs[++i%songs.length-1] or something along those lines
[06:53:44] <freeclock> Anticom: that maybe is the best, but then I should really need a guideline
[06:53:50] <Cork> Anticom: it wouldn't make a difference actually
[06:53:57] <Cork> its just lists here too
[06:54:21] <Anticom> sure is, but why serialize the stuff to html on the server just to parse it back on the client... bongus IMO
[06:54:23] <Anticom> no offense :)
[06:54:34] <freeclock> Cork: this works =)
[06:55:11] <Cork> Anticom: well this way you provide downloadable lists and a few other good effects
[06:56:46] <freeclock> Cork : when I put this code to my index.html and play song it open the link
[06:56:48] <Anticom> Cork: hm well think i'd have gone for an api that returns albums / songs depending on a searchquery etc. But whatever floats his boat. If you guys are happy i am :)
[06:56:58] <Anticom> Cork: still curious about the "other good effects" :p
[06:57:05] <Anticom> Are you talking about SEO etc.?
[06:57:20] <Anticom> freeclock: look at your dev tool's console for errors
[06:57:30] <Anticom> Also don't open your page using file:// protocol
[06:58:02] <freeclock> Cork : It works good in jsfiddle you made
[06:58:16] <freeclock> Anticom: I got localhost
[06:58:34] <Anticom> freeclock: just made sure ;)
[06:59:45] <freeclock> Does it works for you if u put this into a index.html file? --> http://jsfiddle.net/WsXX3/2239/
[07:01:34] <Cork> freeclock: how did you "put it in an index file"?
[07:01:45] <Cork> cause jsfiddle wrapps the code in a onload event
[07:01:56] <Cork> so the init() will run after the page has been constructed
[07:02:06] <Cork> if you just copy it it will run too early
[07:03:57] <freeclock> Oh it was css fail
[07:04:03] <freeclock> Found it =)
[07:20:42] <SaffronD> I am using jQuery to make an XHR request to an endpoint on the same domain (and protocol/port) which returns a header (Set-Cookie) which is HTTPOnly. Once this request is complete, I do another request (via promise chaining) however it seems that on the subsequent request the cookie is not updated from the set-cookie header, why may this be?
[07:24:04] <Cork> SaffronD: hmm, some security settings in browsers prevent cookies from getting set from sub-requests
[07:24:18] <Cork> SaffronD: meaning the cookie would have to be set from a full page load
[07:24:29] <Cork> SaffronD: that MIGHT be what you are seeing
[07:25:55] <SaffronD> Cork: well what's odd is if I set a timeout (setTimeout) of say 1s it correctly sets it for subsequent requests..
[07:27:35] <Cork> hmm, weird
[07:27:50] <Cork> might be a timing issue then, never seen that my self though
[07:32:27] <SaffronD> neither, I tried in a different browser and got the same result, so I find it hard to believe it's a timing issue, more likely a user error :)
[07:44:28] <realies> I've got a selector of a few elements
[07:44:37] <realies> I'd want to map their data-id to an array
[07:44:56] <realies> is that achievable with map instead of foreach and push into an array?
[07:51:54] <SaffronD> realies: sure is
[07:54:27] <realies> SaffronD, I'm currently at
[07:54:50] <realies> .map(function() { return [$.map($(this).data(), function(v) { return v; })]; }).get();
[07:55:03] <realies> but still not getting a pure data-id value array
[07:55:33] <SaffronD> realies: do you want all data attributes or just data-id of all elements?
[07:55:38] <realies> just data-id
[07:55:53] <realies> when i change the above to data("id") it doesn't like it
[07:56:04] <SaffronD> define: doesn't like it
[07:56:41] <realies> Uncaught TypeError: Cannot use 'in' operator to search for 'length' in 132899  at s (jquery.min.js:2)
[07:56:44] <SaffronD> SaffronD: I assume it's because $.map() is expecting the first parameter to be an array, but lets disregard that for now. we know to get a single elements data-id we can do .data('id')
[07:56:55] <realies> yeah
[07:57:50] <SaffronD> SaffronD: so next is try and understand how $(selector).map() works since I believe we only need one map (be it jQuery.map or $(...).map)
[07:58:24] <realies> I've read the docs for map
[07:58:54] <realies> and have tried $(selector).map(function(key,value) { return value.getAttribute("data-id");  } ); which works
[07:59:02] <realies> but am unsure how to glue that in an array
[07:59:24] <SaffronD> realies: https://api.jquery.com/toArray/
[08:01:37] <realies> um..?
[08:01:49] <realies> map().toArray()?
[08:02:21] <realies> bang!
[08:02:32] <realies> thank you SaffronD
[08:11:55] <Cork> realies: $().map returns a jquery object
[08:12:53] <Cork> you want $.map($('selector'), function(elm) { elm.getAttribute("data-id") })
[08:13:05] <Cork> opps
[08:13:08] <Cork> you want $.map($('selector'), function(elm) { return elm.getAttribute("data-id") })
[09:05:36] <realies> Cork, I've done it with $("selector").map(function() { return this.getAttribute("data-id"); }).toArray();
[09:36:54] <Cork> realies: ya, but that creates a jquery object for no reason
[09:53:24] <SaffronD> yeah using cork's solution is slightly more efficient
[09:53:44] <Cork> it matters more how often you need to run it
[09:54:13] <Cork> for me it is more a principal thing, i don't want to first loop the collection, create an array wrap the array in a jquery object
[09:54:36] <Cork> to then convert the wrapped jquery array into an array again (why, i already had an array??)
[09:55:08] <Cork> prob comes as a consequence of actually knowing what goes one when things gets created :)
[09:56:20] <wmute> hey, having trouble targeting an element withina PHP created nested structure...example: http://codepen.io/anon/pen/jBLMKM  >>> you can see the structure in the HTML part inside .expandable-header is the searchform.php call
[09:57:17] <wmute> what I'd like to target is the .input-holder or # exp_search with the .click(funtion) (which is in this example targeting the .expandable-header)
[09:58:19] <taplar> you're loading that from with ajax or something?
[09:58:25] <taplar> from/form
[09:59:26] <wmute> I'm loading it from wordpress CMS
[09:59:27] <taplar> brb
[09:59:37] <taplar> so the form is there on page load?
[10:00:29] <wmute> yea the form is there but i'd like to target the element within
[10:16:26] <taplar> bak
[10:16:52] <taplar> you should be able to target it with that class, unless you got it stuck between <!-- --> like you do in that pastee
[10:20:08] <Cork> wmute: is the expandable-header loaded through ajax?
[10:20:09] <canned> do the current public versions of jQuery have the getJSON function in them?
[10:20:31] <Cork> canned: uh, every version since like 1.0 do
[10:21:01] <Cork> $.getJSON is just a small wrapper around $.ajax
[10:21:26] <wmute> Cork: no it is the homepage so to speak
[10:21:43] <Cork> then the targeting should work just fine...
[10:22:27] <canned> oh ok, yeah looks like it was a forum thread from ages ago
[10:23:13] <taplar> if you wonder about when a method was added, the api usually lists that in the top right corner of where it describes the method
[10:23:20] <wmute> so when I would put .input-holder into $('.HERE').click(function() it does not seems to target that div
[10:23:32] <Cork> -usually +always :)
[10:23:49] <wmute> at least the functionality of click, which is expanding the .expandable-body doesn't work
[10:23:52] <canned> getting "getJSON is not a function" error from my own screws then :| any idea what the proper way to load jQuery into independently-run javascript is? have only been able to find help on inserting it into html headers
[10:23:54] * taplar is being a politician it seems, ^_^
[10:24:28] <Cork> canned: you shouldn't try to load jquery separately from the site
[10:24:49] <Cork> canned: it is a recipe for a very messy site
[10:24:58] <Cork> just have the site load jquery and use that
[10:25:02] <canned> I'm trying to make a generator for son-server
[10:25:09] <canned> er son-server
[10:25:14] <canned> hm, autocorrecting
[10:25:22] <canned> json-server
[10:25:33] <taplar> what's a json server?
[10:25:44] <wmute> Cork: have a live example online in a sec...although you cannot see the PHP calls in the dev-view?
[10:25:50] <Cork> wmute: check that $('-input-holder').length > 0
[10:26:00] <canned> its like for making a simple api on your local environment
[10:26:00] <Cork> opps
[10:26:03] <Cork> wmute: check that $('.input-holder').length > 0
[10:26:04] <canned> for testing etc
[10:26:26] <taplar> you mean a server that returns json?
[10:26:34] <canned> yeah one of those
[10:26:51] <taplar> never heard one of those referred to as a json server.  it's just a server, :P
[10:27:02] <canned> its just literally called json-server
[10:27:03] <Cork> not sure why that would mean you have to load jquery independently in a lib
[10:27:30] <canned> yeah, I'm probably not doing it right :/ it seemed like getJSON would be helpful for something I'm trying to do
[10:27:39] <Cork> also if json is the only reason, you might be better of removing the jquery dependency
[10:28:19] <canned> its purely for getting the server to return the  json I want properly. if I can get it to do that, it serves its purpose
[10:28:44] <wmute> Cork: when I add .length > 0, the searchform.php is not loading anymore
[10:28:45] <midori-rus> Hello there. Does anybody use jquery with webpack. I mean jquery like a modules?
[10:28:48] <canned> it just needs to behave even remotely like a commercial service
[10:28:53] <Cork> uh...
[10:29:09] <canned> none of this javascript will go into anything production
[10:29:11] <Cork> wmute: that was meant to be a test you should run to make sure the selector matches anything
[10:29:36] <Cork> wmute: something like console.log('holders: ', $('.input-holder').length);
[10:29:47] <midori-rus> I mean module pattern like that https://learn.jquery.com/code-organization/concepts/
[10:30:27] <wmute> Cork: holders:  1 is the output
[10:30:58] <Cork> wmute: ok, could you make an example of what you have problem with (without putting it in a comment) in a jsfiddle.net?
[10:31:12] <Cork> i don't really care about the php code, just include what the generated result looks loke
[10:31:24] <Cork> *look like
[10:31:27] <taplar> midori-rus: sure, we use a modular pattern at my workplace for our javascript code
[10:31:45] <ZoderUck> hi
[10:32:15] <ZoderUck> what is the best strategy to resize a news card in height so it is has the same height as the other ones in the same bootstrap row ?
[10:33:00] <taplar> i'm not intimately familiar with bs, but is there a bs class to mark objects as cells?
[10:33:01] <Cork> ZoderUck: => ##bootstrap
[10:33:27] <midori-rus> taplar: and do u use webpack?
[10:33:35] <taplar> no
[10:35:56] <wmute> Cork: http://codepen.io/anon/pen/jBLMKM as good as...I guess the .click function should work when you click the search field?
[10:36:38] <Cork> wmute: as the search field is in a comment, no
[10:36:59] <wmute> Cork: oops not updated I suppose
[10:37:31] <Cork> wmute: ya, codepen.io and jsbin.com is bad for sharing code as it gets stale very very easy (and loses changes)
[10:37:39] <Cork> wmute: and that is why i recommended jsfiddle
[10:37:51] <wmute> Cork: http://codepen.io/anon/pen/jBLMKM should be updated now
[10:39:19] <Cork> wmute: input-holder has no sibling expandable-body
[10:43:51] <wmute> Cork: ooh duh.. how would I target the .input-holder with the click function and add and removeClasses from it's parents?
[10:44:41] <taplar> expandable-body is a child of expandable-container, right?
[10:50:57] <wmute> taplar: yes
[10:51:43] <taplar> so if you can find the expandable-container that the input-holder belongs to, you could then find the expandable-body that belongs to it
[10:52:05] <Cork> $(this).closest('.expandable-header').siblings('.expandable-body') could be an option
[10:53:04] <Cork> but ya, you could add the class to .expandable-header and have css find the body from there
[10:53:32] <Cork> (.expandable-header.hidden-class ~ .expandable-body {})
[10:54:03] <wmute> Taplar: great! that did it
[10:54:30] <wmute> thanks to both of you Cork & taplar
[11:09:27] <DexDeadly> anyone using https://github.com/vedmack/yadcf ?
[11:58:55] <ZoderUck> hey
[11:59:33] <ZoderUck> Hello, maxheight who would like to help me with discover the reason why the result is not as expected?
[11:59:40] <ZoderUck> Who uses MatchHeight here ?
[12:36:57] <Anticom> ZoderUck: don't ask to ask, just ask your question
[12:37:11] <Anticom> And please provide some context to your question. I don't get at all what you're asking for
[12:41:55] <robertmaxrees> gooooooooood morning #jquery
[12:43:00] <Anticom> lol it's almost 6pm here
[12:43:02] <Anticom> o/
[12:43:55] <taplar> condolences on the end of the vaca
[12:45:01] <robertmaxrees> hah.  i'm glad to be back tbh.
[13:54:30] <aaaa^> does anyone know a html-based "selectbox" widget ?
[13:55:25] <robertmaxrees> i mean, <select> is a thing...
[13:55:57] <taplar> what are you calling 'html-based'?
[13:56:04] <robertmaxrees> heh
[13:56:21] <aaaa^> i mean non-<select> based
[13:56:30] <robertmaxrees> wut
[13:56:40] <robertmaxrees> so then you want a plugin.
[13:56:43] <aaaa^> so that I can make some markup myself
[13:57:01] <aaaa^> yes but i don't want to supply a <select>
[13:57:08] <aaaa^> as all these plugins seem to want
[13:57:17] <aaaa^> just want to supply my own markup
[13:57:22] <aaaa^> <ul....?
[13:57:23] <robertmaxrees> sounds like you need to make your own then.
[13:57:26] <Anticom> aaaa^: chosen, select2
[13:57:39] <robertmaxrees> Anticom iirc those specify markup too.
[13:57:48] <robertmaxrees> aaaa^ what kind of customization do you need?
[13:57:58] <taplar> i mean, i assume a lot of plugins allow you to just stick in the data to show, rather than it deriving the data from a select statement
[13:58:15] <Anticom> taplar: yup
[13:58:26] <Anticom> aaaa^: also why do you want to do things not as intended?
[13:58:29] <aaaa^> i just want to be able to build the markup myself, and not need to supply json/<select>
[13:58:52] <taplar> oooooh, i get it
[13:58:52] <Anticom> it's like using an <img> tag and swapping images to get a canvas going lol
[13:58:55] <aaaa^> i do want to do things as intended. by me.
[13:59:01] <taplar> yah, what robert said
[13:59:03] <robertmaxrees> then you'll need to build your own plugin.
[13:59:13] <robertmaxrees> you can't use somebody else's and then expect to define your own markup.
[13:59:24] <Anticom> i don't get it...
[13:59:36] <taplar> Anticom: plugins take data and generate markup
[13:59:38] <robertmaxrees> he wants to build a selectbox style widget but define his own markup for it.
[13:59:41] <taplar> he just wants to give it the markup
[13:59:56] <aaaa^> i don't want to necessarily define it, just want to supply it
[13:59:56] <Anticom> taplar: like a template for each element?
[14:00:10] <robertmaxrees> yeah, then you'll need to build your own plugin.
[14:00:10] <taplar> he wants to skip the plugin markup generation step
[14:00:16] <Anticom> the plugins mentioned by me should be able to do this
[14:00:25] <Anticom> huh
[14:00:26] <Anticom> ?
[14:00:38] <aaaa^> @Anticom, i just want to give it a <ul><li>....
[14:00:40] <Anticom> well guys, sorry i'm done for today... my head is toast
[14:00:45] <aaaa^> and not a <selectbox>/json
[14:00:50] <robertmaxrees> Anticom those both take templates.  he wants to use his own specific markup for each one.
[14:00:52] <Anticom> aaaa^: give it a <select> instead...
[14:01:00] <robertmaxrees> yeah aaaa^ you'll be hand-rolling a solution.
[14:01:48] <aaaa^> quite surprised there isn't one that allows me to do this
[14:01:57] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[14:02:17] <robertmaxrees> kind of hard to build a plugin that can't assume the markup/data format.
[14:02:19] <robertmaxrees> how would that work?
[14:02:26] <taplar> i mean, the number of different combinations that you could go with that you are expecting something to just work with, is kinda not realistic
[14:02:30] <Anticom> you guys are talking about something like that? https://select2.github.io/examples.html#templating
[14:02:40] <robertmaxrees> Anticom already p[ointed this out
[14:02:43] <aaaa^> i don't mind using a template, just needs to be html
[14:02:45] <robertmaxrees> he doesn't want templating.
[14:02:56] <Anticom> jeez, i'm really giving up then
[14:02:59] <robertmaxrees> heh
[14:03:01] <Anticom> 10hrs of work is too much for me :D
[14:03:04] <robertmaxrees> aaaa^ why do you need that?
[14:03:17] <robertmaxrees> feels awfully x/yish to me
[14:03:41] <aaaa^> sorry dunno what x/yish means
[14:04:12] <robertmaxrees> you want to solve problem x, and you think y is the solution, but y is kind of a strange thing to want to do.  tell us about x instead.
[14:05:29] <aaaa^> i just want to feed it html, because i have it already
[14:05:46] <robertmaxrees> but why?
[14:05:50] <robertmaxrees> that's where you're losing us.
[14:06:06] <aaaa^> why is html better than json.... this i cannot answer :)
[14:06:06] <robertmaxrees> usually you want to use JSON and let the plugin do the rest.
[14:06:22] <robertmaxrees> for defining data it's worse than json.
[14:06:49] <robertmaxrees> either way, given your requirements you'll need to build your own solution.
[14:07:01] <aaaa^> seems so.... which is quite surprising
[14:07:09] <robertmaxrees> why is it surprising?
[14:07:47] <robertmaxrees> it's extremely difficult to build a plugin like that without knowing what format you'll accept.
[14:07:51] <taplar> it should also be noted that if you are building the markup for the plugin, if you ever decide to update the plugin and it decides to change how it generates the markup, you'd have to change your logic that generates the markup.  where as if you just gave it the data, probably a lot less likely to have to deal with that.
[14:07:55] <aaaa^> no the format doesn't matter
[14:08:03] <robertmaxrees> errr, but it does.
[14:08:18] <robertmaxrees> because the plugin can't know what to read otherwise.
[14:08:32] <aaaa^> i just want to say: here is an item: <li...../>
[14:08:40] <aaaa^> done.
[14:08:49] <robertmaxrees> yeah, can't really do that.
[14:08:59] <aaaa^> yeah, i do see now how hard that is :))
[14:28:33] <WeiJunLi> what other jquery methods can i use to send data to my site besides $.ajax or $.post() ?
[14:28:44] <robertmaxrees> $.post() uses ajax
[14:28:50] <robertmaxrees> same with $.get()
[14:29:55] <robertmaxrees> any particular reason you can't use them WeiJunLi?
[14:30:08] <WeiJunLi> no just curiosity
[14:31:16] <robertmaxrees> alright.
[14:35:44] <relipse> I have an interesting dilemma, i'm copying data from 2 input fields over to 2 other input fields but the 2nd input fields call an ajax which end up replacing the 2 fields with empty string "". I was considering using setTimout() to wait until ajax is called but I don't know how long it will take. What should I do?
[14:36:00] <robertmaxrees> use .then()
[14:36:15] <robertmaxrees> $.ajax().then(function() { /* yer code here */ });
[14:36:33] <WeiJunLi> cannot use ajax though
[14:36:37] <relipse> thanks.. looking into it
[14:36:50] <robertmaxrees> WeiJunLi then you're left with normal form posts.
[14:37:08] <WeiJunLi> like?
[14:37:14] <robertmaxrees> html forms
[14:37:45] <WeiJunLi> the challenge is doing it with jquery
[14:37:50] <robertmaxrees> wat
[14:37:59] <robertmaxrees> could you clarify what you're trying to accomplish?
[14:43:40] <taplar> magic
[14:50:27] <WeiJunLi> robertmaxrees: send data to a website with jquery but without using $.ajax() nor $.post()
[14:50:28] <WeiJunLi> is it possible
[14:50:34] <WeiJunLi> tthere's something that replace those?
[14:50:36] <robertmaxrees> uh
[14:50:37] <robertmaxrees> wat
[14:50:43] <robertmaxrees> can you give some context here?
[14:50:49] <robertmaxrees> because that's a really strange request.
[14:52:24] <taplar> without ajax your left with normal interactions of the browser to make it send the data, or if available the use of websockets can do it too
[14:52:36] <robertmaxrees> but none of those use jquery
[14:52:49] <taplar> though i guess websockets is kinda ajaxy.  dunno if it falls in that classification technically
[15:19:23] <taplar> whoo hoo, i was able to answer a bs question, ^_^
[16:43:59] <sherm4n4tor> Quick question.  I have an <LI> as "this" in an event.  What is the best way to get to the parent <UL>?
[16:44:11] <robertmaxrees> .closest('ul');
[16:44:17] <z1haze> .parent()
[16:44:35] <z1haze> hi robertmaxrees
[16:44:50] <sherm4n4tor> robertmaxrees: thank you.
[16:44:50] <robertmaxrees> yo
[16:45:01] <z1haze> why wouldnt you recommend .parent() ?
[16:45:13] <z1haze> i dont think anything inside a ul other than an li is valid html is it?
[16:45:19] <robertmaxrees> .closest() decouples the logic from the markup a little bit.
[16:45:35] <z1haze> i suppose
[16:45:47] <robertmaxrees> i generally use .closest()
[16:45:55] <z1haze> i have a question myself
[16:46:01] <z1haze> I have a hover event on an element
[16:46:15] <z1haze> but when it is 'selected' id like to ignore that hover event.. is that possible with jq?
[16:46:25] <z1haze> since its binded at dom ready
[16:46:34] <robertmaxrees> how do you know it's "selected"?
[16:46:44] <z1haze> has a class
[16:46:49] <z1haze> but its realtime toggles
[16:46:54] <z1haze> like a check a box, and it 'selects' this one
[16:47:14] <robertmaxrees> if ($(this).hasClass('foo')) { return false; }
[16:47:27] <robertmaxrees> before the other logic.
[16:47:41] <robertmaxrees> or wrap it in a if (!$(this).hasClass('foo')) { /* yer code here */ }
[16:47:46] <z1haze> but dont I have to bind to all of them on dom ready?
[16:47:53] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[16:48:01] <robertmaxrees> you said it's bound at dom ready.
[16:48:05] <z1haze> it is
[16:48:08] <z1haze> but when when it changes
[16:48:14] <z1haze> doesnt it no longer belong to that
[16:48:18] <z1haze> let me just try and see i think im confusing myself
[16:48:23] <robertmaxrees> yeah, if the classes can be added/removed, just add that step.
[16:48:27] <robertmaxrees> instead of juggling bidnings.
[16:48:45] <z1haze> how about something like $('.my-el:not(.selected)') ?
[16:48:55] <robertmaxrees> don't juggle bindings.
[16:49:07] <robertmaxrees> othewrwise you have to make sure you don't double-bind.
[16:49:10] <taplar> are you thinking that when the selector no longer matches, the binding ceases to exist?
[16:49:11] <robertmaxrees> just add that check and call it a day
[16:49:24] <z1haze> yea taplar that was my though
[16:49:41] <z1haze> because on page load none of them will have that selected class
[16:49:54] <z1haze> so i figured anything that happens post dom load wouldnt matter
[16:49:57] <z1haze> ill do as robertmaxrees suggests
[16:50:28] <taplar> you could potentially change it to a delegate and put the conditional part in the child filter selector
[16:50:45] <z1haze> it kinda works
[16:50:51] <robertmaxrees> that's what i'd probably do.
[16:50:55] <robertmaxrees> the delegated binding.
[16:50:58] <z1haze> except the checkbox to toggle select is on the element im hovering
[16:51:05] <z1haze> so its in hover state
[16:51:06] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[16:51:07] <z1haze> and never comes out
[16:51:08] <z1haze> lol
[16:51:10] <robertmaxrees> make a filter dawg
[16:51:14] <robertmaxrees> err, fiddle.
[16:51:17] <z1haze> sure
[17:07:00] <z1haze> robertmaxrees, this is a rough demo https://jsfiddle.net/rdokpq75/
[17:07:18] <z1haze> checking this checkbox toggles the selected class typically
[17:08:02] <z1haze> so basically you'd be hovering the the element when you add the class, thus the mouseout effect never happens
[17:10:52] <taplar> so what are you wanting to (not) do when the checkbox is selected?
[17:12:50] <z1haze> i dont want to see my effect onthe card
[17:12:51] <z1haze> the buttons
[17:13:09] <z1haze> the dimmer() jquery function
[17:16:36] <robertmaxrees> you mean semantic
[17:16:49] <z1haze> yep
[17:16:57] <pippuccio76> i , i want sort a datatable by european date : http://lemuria.altervista.org/datatables/ but dont work
[17:17:09] <robertmaxrees> z1haze like https://jsfiddle.net/24amd4pg/1/ ?
[17:17:19] <z1haze> the delegated listener is probably what will work
[17:17:25] <z1haze> yea that
[17:17:34] <robertmaxrees> heh
[17:17:41] <z1haze> u think thats hacky?
[17:17:51] <robertmaxrees> newp.
[17:20:31] <taplar> ah, 'hide'
[17:20:43] <robertmaxrees> yeah, had to look up the semantic docs.
[17:20:55] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/rdokpq75/1/  i was trying remove and off and etc, lol
[17:21:10] <taplar> removeClass didn't do it, and then i realized it was a plubin
[17:23:13] <z1haze> well thanks
[17:25:55] <zenox> hi
[17:26:01] <robertmaxrees> good afternoo
[17:26:01] <zenox> hi, i'm abstracting the fetching of content from a file via jquery's .get into a class function, but now i want to do something after that content has loaded. how can i know this? is there something like a myClass.SetContent('filename','#myId').then(....)
[17:26:28] <robertmaxrees> you could accept a callback.
[17:26:29] <zenox> it's a dark evening here :(
[17:26:34] <robertmaxrees> otherwise return the ajax call.
[17:27:06] <zenox> mhh... interesting, but a callback would limit to one simple function though right? what if i wanted to do: mycall.then(foo).then(bar)
[17:27:15] <robertmaxrees> then return our the ajax call.
[17:27:17] <robertmaxrees> *out
[17:51:54] <z1haze> hey robertmaxrees
[17:51:59] <robertmaxrees> das me
[17:52:06] <z1haze> what if I wanted to not have the effect on the checkbox hover
[17:52:28] <robertmaxrees> clarify?
[17:52:37] <z1haze> well on mouse enter it activates dimmer
[17:52:45] <z1haze> i tick the checkbox then it adds the class of selected
[17:52:46] <robertmaxrees> (fiddle link pls)
[17:52:50] <z1haze> https://jsfiddle.net/24amd4pg/1/
[17:53:00] <z1haze> anyway
[17:53:08] <z1haze> so when i tick the box for selected it adds that class
[17:53:14] <z1haze> but its still in the mouse enter so its currently in 'hover'
[17:53:18] <robertmaxrees> it does?
[17:53:23] <z1haze> and doesnt actually disable until i mouse leave
[17:53:24] <z1haze> yea
[17:53:24] <robertmaxrees> where's the code for that bit?
[17:53:34] <z1haze> its in vue ill make it in jqueryt real quick so show u
[17:53:49] <robertmaxrees> wait shouldn't you be using vue for all this?
[17:54:00] <z1haze> i am
[17:54:03] <z1haze> minus dimmer
[17:54:07] <robertmaxrees> 'kay
[17:54:18] <z1haze> the codes already there im not gonna remake it
[17:54:19] <robertmaxrees> anyway, that means that you'll need to add logic for your checkbox stuff.
[17:54:25] <z1haze> well i was wondering
[17:54:35] <z1haze> can i say dim on .card except on the input?
[17:54:52] <z1haze> since its a child of .card i didnt nkow if that was possible
[17:55:03] <robertmaxrees> it's gonna "pass" through the parent.
[17:55:28] <z1haze> figured
[17:56:36] <z1haze> can i manually trigger a mouseout event
[17:56:49] <robertmaxrees> why not just call the logic that handler calls?
[17:56:52] <z1haze> like you can do .trigger('click'
[17:56:53] <robertmaxrees> since that's really what you want.
[17:57:02] <z1haze> oh you mean dimmer hide?
[17:57:06] <robertmaxrees> yeah.
[17:57:10] <robertmaxrees> just call it on that parent element.
[17:57:13] <z1haze> good point.
[17:57:58] <zenox> heh, it turns out ie11 doesn't like promises
[17:58:14] <robertmaxrees> zenox erm,
[17:58:22] <robertmaxrees> if you're using jquery's ajax, you're fine.
[17:58:33] <robertmaxrees> return $.ajax();
[18:00:08] <z1haze> works beautifully
[18:00:19] <z1haze> on the change event, $(e.target).closest('.card').find('.image').dimmer('hide');
[18:00:28] <robertmaxrees> boom
[18:00:35] <z1haze> that just seems so ugly though
[18:00:38] <z1haze> maybe its just jquery :)
[18:01:15] <z1haze> im trying to do more and more vanilla js, but i always find myself going back to my roots of jquery because its so easy
[18:01:18] <robertmaxrees> z1haze i mean, you could store some things in vars to make it easier to read.
[18:04:05] <taplar> what about if you uncheck the checkbox?
[18:04:51] <zenox> robertmaxrees, yeah this was for something else actually ;)
