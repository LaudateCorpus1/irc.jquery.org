[00:57:00] <Cork> you can't ever prevent the user from changing anything client side
[01:05:00] <robertmaxrees> robertmaxrees what problem are you actually trying to solve?
[01:05:05] <robertmaxrees> errr, robertparkerx lolk
[01:05:31] <Cork> talking to your self huh? :P
[01:05:45] <robertmaxrees> got nobody else to talk to these days hahaha
[01:05:55] <Cork> heh
[04:42:02] <petzup> https://jsfiddle.net/e3Ldq6ou/1/
[04:42:05] <petzup> what is wrong here
[04:42:15] <petzup> inside S1 should be all arrays which have S1 ID
[04:47:50] <Cork> petzup: newArray is an object not an array to start with
[04:48:32] <Cork> newArray[obj['ID']][i] is doing [i] on undefined so that will fail
[04:50:07] <Cork> (note that the first comment is about the name not that you use an object there (that part is correct)
[04:50:11] <Cork> )
[04:50:28] <petzup> https://jsfiddle.net/e3Ldq6ou/2/
[04:50:31] <petzup> i change it little bit
[04:50:35] <petzup> but no output
[04:51:16] <Cork> please put the scripts in the script section instead of the html section
[04:52:54] <Cork> petzup: your variables are inverted for the filter function
[04:53:11] <Cork> or arguments more correctly

[11:24:12] <codecutter> i need to perform a task after the items have been appended to the dom, if i just call the function after this line, it seems to invoked before append is completed $('.convoList'.append(htmlElemsArr); processAppends();
[11:24:38] <codecutter> $('.convoList').append(htmlElemsArr);
[11:27:22] <codecutter> i'm trying to auto scroll down after the append
[11:48:54] <codecutter> what to do on EventSource timesout e.g. 504 status code?
[12:17:40] <robertmaxrees> codecutter your first problem statement seems... off.  that's a sycnronous operation.  mind providing more code for context?
[12:18:55] <codecutter> robertmaxrees  $(document).scrollHeight} seems to work
[12:19:12] <robertmaxrees> I mean your bit about the append.
[12:19:32] <codecutter> ignore that
[12:19:41] <robertmaxrees> ah, figured it out?
[12:19:52] <codecutter> i think so
[12:20:09] <codecutter> <codecutter> what to do on EventSource timesout e.g. 504 status code?
[12:20:24] <robertmaxrees> Dunno - what do you want to do?
[12:21:06] <codecutter> EventSource.onerror event implies the connection is closed?
[12:21:22] <robertmaxrees> if it times out, that's generally what ends up happening.
[12:21:48] <codecutter> ah, understood.
[12:21:56] <robertmaxrees> you could retry x number of times, or show an error to the user, or both.  could silently fail.  could do all kinds of things.
[12:22:14] <robertmaxrees> it means the connection stayed open longer than the server says is acceptable.
[12:22:41] <codecutter> i need to reopen the connection
[12:22:47] <robertmaxrees> you can't :)
[12:22:56] <robertmaxrees> you have to start a new request.
[12:23:06] <robertmaxrees> sounds liek really you want to extend the timeout on your server.
[12:23:06] <codecutter> yea, thats what i mean, sorry
[12:23:21] <codecutter> is that possible?
[12:23:34] <robertmaxrees> most http servers support extending that, yes.
[12:23:37] <robertmaxrees> what server are you using?
[12:23:50] <codecutter> i have nginx running a reverse proxy to a local tomcat instance on my server
[12:24:03] <codecutter> as a reverse*
[12:24:14] <robertmaxrees> so then check both of those.
[12:24:26] <robertmaxrees> :) you'll need to extend the timeout on both.
[12:24:43] <robertmaxrees> *likely need to, rather.
[12:26:30] <codecutter> is this enough? https://github.com/mdn/dom-examples/tree/master/server-sent-events
[12:26:41] <robertmaxrees> Huh?
[12:26:43] <codecutter> see the text
[12:26:46] <robertmaxrees> that is not what i suggested.
[12:26:54] <codecutter> i know
[12:26:56] <robertmaxrees> ...
[12:26:58] <robertmaxrees> lmao
[12:27:08] <robertmaxrees> you lost me :)
[12:27:13] <codecutter> thats an eventsource example
[12:27:26] <robertmaxrees> what does that have to do with increasing timeouts?
[12:28:01] <codecutter> i think.i need those option too?
[12:28:07] <robertmaxrees> no.
[12:28:15] <robertmaxrees> the issue is the request is taking too long to complete.
[12:28:28] <robertmaxrees> so your server is closing the coinnection to free up resources.
[12:28:40] <robertmaxrees> you need to increase the timeout.  it could be coming from tomcat or nginx.
[12:28:49] <robertmaxrees> so you'll need to make sure both are properly configured.
[12:29:06] <codecutter> what would be a suitable value?
[12:29:18] <robertmaxrees> I don't know :)
[12:29:28] <robertmaxrees> it changes on a per-application basis.
[12:29:48] <robertmaxrees> how long does the backend take to process these requests under full load?
[12:30:19] <codecutter> i don't have the metrics
[12:30:29] <robertmaxrees> so what does that tell you? :)
[12:31:40] <codecutter> what if i reconnected every time it timeout?
[12:31:50] <codecutter> that'll work right?
[12:31:54] <robertmaxrees> no.
[12:32:00] <robertmaxrees> because you're starting the query over again.
[12:32:05] <robertmaxrees> which will cause the some problems.
[12:32:41] <robertmaxrees> *the same
[12:33:20] <codecutter> i see
[12:34:08] <robertmaxrees> you can use tools like jmeter to run analytics and at least synthetically simulate load on a system.
[12:34:14] <robertmaxrees> might be worth checking out in this case.
[12:36:56] <codecutter> This eventsource is for a direct message service, I have SSE (Server sent Events)  running on the server and whenever a message comes in the server saves it then pushes it out the relevant client (both clients).
[12:37:10] <robertmaxrees> i don't know how else to phrase it.
[12:37:18] <robertmaxrees> the issue is the timeout duration on your server.
[12:37:21] <robertmaxrees> full stop :)
[12:37:36] <codecutter> understood
[12:45:57] <codecutter> keepalive_timeout or send_timeout (or neither)?
[12:46:20] <robertmaxrees> you'll need to ask in tomcat/nginx related places :)
[12:46:35] <codecutter> ok kewl
[12:46:37] <codecutter> thx
[12:53:42] <codecutter> how do social networks like facebook figure out whether a person's name is legible during registration? e.g. if you types some random text into the name field it detects it  'enter a valid name'
[12:54:41] <robertmaxrees> probably some weird draconian check that tries to validate the name against some crude rules.
