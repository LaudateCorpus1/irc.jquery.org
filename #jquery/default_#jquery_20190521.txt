[12:25:08] <taplar> so quiet
[12:33:52] <thykka>  
[14:25:49] <dimm_> hello, All! need some information for build  interface with elements which depends on another elements. Another words if user choose checkbox1 then engine display also list1 and radio1. If user choose checkbox1 and checkbox2 then engine display elements which common for this two checkboxes. Can you say some words related to this situation?
[14:27:03] <taplar> So at a minimum you're going to need change event listeners on those checkboxes
[14:27:04] <taplar> which will then need to check which ones are checked to know how to proceed
[14:30:37] <dimm_> taplar, thanks for startpoint, i can continue now :-)
[18:19:15] <FeersumEndjinn> Hey everyone - at a particular point in a form, I want to check if an element has a particular class, and if not I want to copy some text from one field to another
[18:19:30] <FeersumEndjinn> So far I have:  $('#request_delegated_toggle').not('.checked').$('#id_subject_name').value = $('#id_requester').value;
[18:19:34] <FeersumEndjinn> but it isn't working
[18:19:54] <taplar> ok, first point
[18:20:07] <taplar> $(selector).method().$() <= is never valid syntax
[18:20:41] <taplar> secondly, how is the second id related to the first?
[18:21:40] <taplar> also, jQuery does not expose the `value` property.  You have to use `val()~
[18:21:44] <taplar> `val()`
[18:22:03] <FeersumEndjinn> It is a name in the same form.  If a checkbox isn't checked, I want to copy said name from one field to another.
[18:22:36] <taplar> if ($('#....').is(':not(:checked)')) { ... }
[18:23:10] <taplar> or you could use the property
[18:23:44] <taplar> if ($('#request_delegated_toggle').prop('checked') === false) { $('#id_subject_name').val($('#id_requester').val()) }
[18:24:33] <FeersumEndjinn> Let me try that, thank you.
[18:27:19] <FeersumEndjinn> Brilliant, that worked :)
[19:17:11] <dopie> whats the jquery way when the user stop typing in a input box it checks the val of what the user typed?
[19:17:18] <dopie> stops
[19:42:55] <pavonia> dopie: Not sure if there's a plugin for this somewhere, but (as the documentation for .delay() says) it's better to use plain JS methods for this
[20:38:04] <dopie> ok
[20:38:10] <dopie> thanks pavonia
[20:38:15] <dopie> I have another question
[20:38:18] <dopie> why isnt this working
[20:38:19] <dopie> https://gist.github.com/staycreativedesign/0a24e5cbf0a3566e0ddcb1f1607daed3
[20:38:24] <dopie> its not catching the changes
[21:03:53] <dopie> https://jsfiddle.net/pares101/mh8a7zo6/1/
[21:05:18] <dopie> it only updates when i click on the first one
[21:11:28] <pavonia> I think $() only accepts a single selector argument
[23:31:07] <dopie> ok
[23:31:11] <dopie> now why doesnt this WORK!
