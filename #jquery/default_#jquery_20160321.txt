[02:11:12] <Cork> Elrinth: you need $(this).children(), you can't use e.target
[02:11:26] <Cork> or possibly this.children (both works)
[02:22:17] <Elrinth> Cork, I used e.target and made it with: closestTarget = $(e.target).closest("svg");
[02:22:47] <Cork> Elrinth: ya, note you shouldn't use e.target
[02:23:02] <Cork> it targets the element you clicked, not the element you bound the event handler on
[02:23:06] <Elrinth> I most definitely should... because this.children is many children
[02:23:25] <Elrinth> yes I want to know which of the children I clicked
[02:23:59] <Elrinth> I can't just do this.children, because I don't know which of them is the one I actually clicked.
[02:24:44] <Elrinth> I might just redo the script and bind on the actual child instead.
[02:26:31] <Elrinth> Cork thank you for taking your time to answer.
[02:27:12] <Cork> Elrinth: the correct solution is to use delegated event listeners
[02:27:46] <Cork> $('static-parent').on('click', '#something', function() {});
[02:28:06] <Cork> though as your fiddling with svg you will have to deal with cross document event blocking
[02:28:09] <Cork> so ya...
[03:29:36] <durwasa> decx: completed level 1 :P quite an addicting game
[05:28:25] <geoid> hi
[05:29:14] <geoid> On an input of type="number" if I do $('#myinput').val(2.4) , the value I end up with is 2,5 instead of 2.5... why?
[05:29:41] <geoid> And how can I get it to be 2.5 instead of 2,5?
[05:30:09] <slax0r> localization settings in browser?
[05:32:30] <geoid> slax0r are there such things? and if so where do I find them? How can I control them?
[05:34:53] <slax0r> geoid: maybe they are tied to the OS regional settings
[05:34:55] <slax0r> dunno
[06:01:32] <Cork> geoid: if you mean precision, it is controled by min/max on the input field
[06:02:22] <geoid> Cork no, not precision I mean it's using the wrong character for decimal separator.
[06:02:47] <Cork> geoid: the decimal format depends on locale
[06:02:49] <geoid> should be a dot but it's using a comma
[06:03:09] <geoid> Cork I understand that but it's wrong for the locale
[06:03:45] <geoid> and I'm not sure how to control locale for a browser, or check what it's set to.
[06:04:31] <Cork> geoid: https://jsfiddle.net/2fo9ryrs/
[06:05:11] <geoid> Cork  both inputs in your jsfiddle show commas for me.
[06:05:19] <Cork> O_o
[06:05:27] <geoid> nobody uses commas for decimal places so wtf is going on?
[06:05:49] <Cork> geoid: plenty of languages does
[06:05:58] <Cork> franc, norway, sweden...
[06:06:28] <geoid> ok fine but not en nor fr nor za
[06:06:40] <geoid> yet I'm seeing commas. Any clue why or how to fix
[06:06:42] <geoid> ?
[06:07:06] <geoid> sorry: not *en* nor *za*
[06:07:17] <Cork> geoid: just noticed that webkit ignores lang for locale
[06:07:33] <Cork> so if your on blink it defaults to system locale and ignores the language of the page
[06:07:49] <Cork> (i get dot and i use en_US as locale)
[06:07:59] <Cork> if i switch my system locale i get comma
[06:08:16] <geoid> Cork I just noticed it's not happening on FF
[06:08:25] <slax0r> that's why you always parse float values from client
[06:08:39] <Cork> geoid: the jsfiddle works on ff
[06:08:45] <geoid> slax0r pls elaborate?
[06:08:54] <Cork> chrome just uses the system locale
[06:09:09] <Cork> slax0r: this is display look, not data
[06:09:23] <Cork> you can't control what decimal separator the browser uses unless you can with lang
[06:09:24] <slax0r> geoid: you never just use the float from client serverside
[06:09:37] <Cork> slax0r: you have to if you want to use number
[06:09:58] <slax0r> Cork: I too don't get , in your fiddle, no matter the lang
[06:10:10] <Cork> slax0r: what os?
[06:10:15] <Cork> ah
[06:10:20] <geoid> in on Mac here
[06:10:21] <Cork> slax0r: ya, that only works in ff
[06:10:36] <Cork> (haven't tried ie)
[06:14:47] <Cork> geoid: this might be an interesting example http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19455-01/806-0169/overview-9/index.html
[06:15:05] <Cork> some languages use dot as thousand separator
[06:17:06] <Cork> wow... percian use / as decimal divider...
[06:22:06] <Xatenev> Cork: w00t :d
[06:23:04] <Cork> also "Kazakh" use - <_<
[06:23:13] <Cork> that got to be confusing...
[06:34:21] <slax0r> Cork: sorry, had to step away for a moment
[06:34:26] <slax0r> I'm using linux
[06:34:46] <Cork> slax0r: ya, same here
[06:34:59] <Cork> and switching system language affects what chrome does
[06:48:20] <geoid> cool.. I'll look into how to change my locale on mac os x. tx guys.
[07:22:25] <aperyon> hey all! id like to reset the jquery css (or remove completly) while using the cdn, but only for the datepicker, as i need the rest of the jquery css for tabs
[07:22:53] <aperyon> i have a completely setup css for the datepicker btw
[07:46:01] <Fleuv> hello, is siblings($selector) only executing the $selector on the siblings found or also on the children of those siblings? e.g. $('.me').siblings('.arm') retrieves: '.cousin .arm'
[07:46:28] <shoky> Fleuv: only on the siblings
[07:46:53] <Fleuv> shoky, okay is there a work around for what im trying to achieve?
[07:47:14] <shoky> .siblings().find(..) ?  donno what you're trying to achieve
[08:11:18] <rtd1123> How do I retrieve the with an object, like this: http://i.imgur.com/ZHzOqqM.png
[08:11:35] <rtd1123> *retrieve the value within
[08:12:33] <shoky> that's an array with an object inside.  arr[0].command
[08:13:27] <rtd1123> works perfect, thanks a bunch!
[08:20:32] <printForever> ( function($) { $('.all-cities-list').length(); } ) ( jQuery );
[08:20:37] <printForever> TypeError: $(...).length is not a function
[08:20:42] <printForever> WTF!
[08:20:54] <rtd1123> usually means it's not finding a math from your selector
[08:20:57] <rtd1123> *match
[08:21:14] <printForever> rtd1123, it says length is not a function
[08:21:17] <shoky> printForever: it's not a function ;p
[08:21:18] <GuessX> no () on length
[08:21:32] <GuessX> ( function($) { $('.all-cities-list').length; } ) ( jQuery );
[08:21:39] <printForever> removed ()
[08:21:41] <printForever> got undefined
[08:21:53] <rtd1123> GuessX: good catch, I overlooked that
[08:22:16] <printForever> there is something screwy here
[08:22:20] <shoky> printForever you just have  $('.all-cities-list').length    in your code or are you doing something with it
[08:22:25] <printForever> no
[08:22:36] <printForever> just checking to see how many elements are inside the div .all-cities-list
[08:22:48] <shoky> with what code
[08:22:55] <printForever> with that line of code
[08:22:57] <printForever> .lenght
[08:23:02] <printForever> -length
[08:23:07] <shoky> that doesn't do anything
[08:23:18] <printForever> there is no .count()
[08:23:31] <shoky> .length is correct to get the length.  but what are you doing with that .length
[08:23:46] <printForever> nothing, I just need to know how many elements are inside the div
[08:23:49] <shoky> e.g.  are you logging it
[08:23:53] <printForever> yes
[08:23:57] <shoky> and btw that doesn't check how many elements are inside it
[08:24:05] <printForever> what should I use?
[08:24:09] <shoky> it checks how many .all-cities-list  elements there are
[08:24:20] <shoky> what exactly do you want to get
[08:24:29] <GuessX> check it with a .each on children?
[08:24:34] <printForever> number of LI inside UL
[08:24:36] <shoky> the number of direct children inside .all-cities-list  element?
[08:24:50] <shoky> $('.all-cities-list > li').length
[08:25:02] <shoky> console.log( $('.all-cities-list > li').length )
[08:25:04] <printForever> undefined
[08:25:10] <rtd1123> Mixed use of $ and jQuery?
[08:25:14] <shoky> then you didn't include jquery properly or something
[08:25:16] <printForever>  0
[08:25:16] <printForever> undefined
[08:25:22] <shoky> so 0
[08:25:25] <shoky> that's not undefined :)
[08:25:38] <printForever>  40
[08:25:56] <shoky> next!
[08:26:12] <rtd1123> shoky++
[08:26:37] <printForever> shoky ftw
[08:27:10] <shoky> printForever: btw the `undefined` that you see it probably the return value from the console.log call
[08:27:17] <shoky> if you're running that in the console
[08:27:23] <shoky> is*
[08:27:43] <jquery898> Good morning all. I'm using FF for debugging but I can't use '$' in console because FF doesn't recognize it and obliged me to use 'jQuery'. Any solution?
[08:28:13] <shoky> jquery898 i don't remember there being any issue with using $ in FF console..
[08:28:13] <GuessX> is jquery loaded?
[08:28:20] <printForever> (function ($) { .... }) (jQuery);
[08:28:26] <jquery898> in the website yes, is working
[08:28:33] <printForever> jquery898 use ^^
[08:28:45] <jquery898> ^^?
[08:29:01] <shoky> if you can use jQuery but not $  then some code has overwritten $ or called $.noConflict()
[08:29:10] <jquery898> printForever: I use that solution inside my .js
[08:29:22] <printForever> God help you
[08:29:30] <jquery898> why?
[08:29:47] <printForever> no, shoky will help you, its faster
[08:29:57] <jquery898> :D
[08:30:16] <shoky> ya $ is working fine for me in ff console
[08:30:48] <jquery898> ah...
[08:31:27] <jquery898> so I have problem in my website, due to some overwriting of $ right?
[08:31:55] <shoky> could be. not necessarily a problem tho
[08:32:02] <shoky> and if you wanna use $ in console...
[08:32:10] <shoky> you can do  $ = jQuery;
[08:33:40] <jquery898> is there an "exact way" to check that problem in the website even if is not necessarily a problem?
[08:34:08] <shoky> well first of all what does  console.log($)  give
[08:37:04] <jquery898> undefined
[08:42:35] <Serg_Penguin> hi ! how can i do plugin what calls sub-functions ? like $('some-selector').myprojStar('add',numStars) or $("..").myprojFilter('blacklist'). How this technique is named to google it up ? Any definitive text on this ?
[08:43:14] <Serg_Penguin> this implies what object being called upon has ID in type in attributes, of coz ;)
[08:44:57] <shoky> jquery898: "exact way" would be to find the code that calls .noConflict()  or explicitly overwrites $  ;S
[08:45:11] <jquery898> ok
[08:45:40] <jquery898> noConflict() avoids that $ is misuse right?
[08:45:41] <shoky> jquery898: if it's a wordpress site or some other CMS , they sometimes add a .noConflict() call at the end of the actual jquery js source file..
[08:45:56] <jquery898> drupal
[08:46:14] <shoky> sounds likely that it's being called, then
[08:46:30] <jquery898> ok
[08:46:46] <jquery898> so probably it's better to leave it
[08:48:15] <shoky> i guess
[08:50:27] <jquery898> shoky: thanks a lot for your time ;)
[09:09:17] <sigdk> hello, I'm trying to populate the data object on an html form: https://jsfiddle.net/32nobeeq/1/ any idea what I'm doing wrong ?
[09:11:59] <Xatenev> sigdk: dont get you
[09:12:09] <Xatenev> sigdk: what is the data object :O
[09:12:26] <Xatenev> sigdk: you just awnna set the value for the two inputs?^^
[09:12:34] <sigdk> yes
[09:12:39] <Xatenev> sec
[09:12:44] <Xatenev> sigdk: https://jsfiddle.net/32nobeeq/2/
[09:14:19] <sigdk> Xatenev, can I use either id or name to access the fields ? Is either way more preferable ?
[09:14:36] <Xatenev> sigdk: if you can use class/id
[09:14:50] <Xatenev> sigdk: accessing over other attributes is mostly not needed
[09:16:41] <sigdk> Xatenev, in my code, data is already a json object. Do I need to to call JSON.parse() ?
[09:17:33] <awkwardCough> no
[09:19:03] <awkwardCough> and it's just an object, not json, :P
[09:23:32] <sigdk> ok, seems to work fine... but I have another question. Two of the fields in my form are dropdown menus that have pre-populated value-text pairs. How can I pre-select the values that the json has for these fields ?
[09:25:16] <Xatenev> sigdk: you select the option from your select via option[value=' + variableWithValue + ... .attr('selected','selected');
[09:26:06] <GuessX> $('#id option:eq('+var+')').prop('selected', true);
[09:38:08] <sigdk> GuessX, it doesn't seem to work
[09:38:40] <GuessX> sigdk, try Xatenevs example
[09:40:19] <sigdk> GuessX, shouldn't initial function that maps the json to the form do it as well ?
[09:40:43] <GuessX> i'd need to see more code
[09:44:15] <sigdk> GuessX, I have a json and I map it on a form. Two of the fields are dropdown menus that already have options populating. I would like the mapping pre-select those options that the json points: https://jsfiddle.net/32nobeeq/2/
[09:45:05] <taplar> pre select?
[09:45:20] <taplar> and you should narrow down your inner selector
[09:45:22] <GuessX> i just see inputs
[09:45:40] <taplar> and that ^
[09:47:01] <GuessX> or add this after line 4
[09:47:05] <GuessX>   $('#'+key' option:eq('+value+')').prop('selected', true);
[09:51:23] <sigdk> ok, I think I found where the problem is, but this will take some time to create a fiddle
[10:08:00] <dan_j> Hi. I'm trying to use the datatables plugin for jquery. I'm loading data over ajax but want to add an unbound checkbox column. When I try to add a column which is not bound, i get an error. Has anyone done this before with datatables?
[10:08:14] <dan_j> DataTables warning: table id=table_invoicing_apartmentblocks - Requested unknown parameter '0' for row 0, column 0.
[10:14:02] <sigdk> GuessX, here 's my fiddle: https://jsfiddle.net/u03nhx81/58/  I understand it's kind of convoluted... but unfortunatelly this is how my original code looks atm. Whenever I click the yellow button, I want to show the form with Alice pre-selected. (note, the form reset doesn't work... so every time the form appears, two more values will be appended)
[10:16:18] <sigdk> seems that foo() is executed before the dropdown gets populated. I'm wondering why...
[10:20:51] <taplar> cause the click is both generating an event and also doing ajax
[10:21:14] <taplar> your running into async issues
[10:22:46] <DummyHead> Hi I'm currently having an issue with removing markers from my map. http://www.gustav.be/locator/ Just enter 9000 in the input and then change the proximity to see what I mean. Does anyone know why the previous markers don't get removed ?
[10:27:00] <sigdk> taplar, the idea is to populate the whole dropdown in .click() and then select the value my json data carries... can I "schedule" the to actions ? Is there any guarantee when happens what ?
[10:27:27] <taplar> one of two ways
[10:27:32] <GuessX> in success call it
[10:27:38] <taplar> either stick the selection in the success callback
[10:27:44] <taplar> or don't call click()
[10:27:53] <taplar> instead call the method directly and have it return a deferred
[10:28:04] <taplar> then in your original function you can attach your later logic with done() or then()
[10:30:45] <sigdk> taplar, is it well defined when happens what ?
[10:31:19] <taplar> success happens when a request resolves with a good http response code
[10:31:34] <taplar> yes, they are well defined.
[10:31:44] <sigdk> tbh, I use the green button to register the user and the yellow to modify a user's already given data
[10:31:59] <sigdk> it's probably a bad design to use the same form to do these two things
[10:32:43] <taplar> *shrug* i know a few apps that do that
[10:32:53] <sigdk> well, I'm talking about the ajax that populates the dropdown and things happening in foo().  I would expect first the menu to be populated, and then me being able to select one of these values. But the latter part happens before
[10:33:13] <taplar> right cause it's not inside one of the callbacks for the deferred
[10:33:26] <taplar> ajax is asynchronous, meaning it will process while other things keep running afte rit
[10:33:38] <taplar> so your trying to select things that are not yet loaded
[10:35:46] <sigdk> taplar, can I make .click() blocking ?
[10:35:55] <taplar> no
[10:35:55] <sigdk> or there isn't such a thing ?
[10:36:27] <taplar> well, not sure, but you don't really want to
[10:37:58] <swedishfish> has anyone ever used datatables where it seems it will work as it added asc/desc icons to the table header, but when you click to sort, nothing happens with the table
[10:38:13] <taplar> sigdk: https://jsfiddle.net/u03nhx81/60/
[10:38:23] <taplar> ^ as opposed to returning the deferred and doing it later
[10:45:39] <sigdk> taplar, there you pre-select always Alice...  (?)
[10:45:59] <DummyHead> Hi I'm currently having an issue with removing markers from my map. http://www.gustav.be/locator/ Just enter 9000 in the input and then change the proximity to see what I mean. Does anyone know why the previous markers don't get removed ?
[10:46:00] <taplar> yep, since that's how you have your json.
[10:47:24] <taplar> is that json what you will actually be returning?
[10:47:39] <taplar> meaning only one property in the object?
[10:56:12] <sigdk> taplar, Alice should be the selected value only when the yellow button in clicked. In short... I have a table with rows of users. Whenever you click a row a form appears. The dropdown has all the users populated. Depending on which row was clicked the corresponding user should appear as pre-selected
[10:58:04] <lintguy> Is it possible to do $.when even on non-ajax stuff?
[10:58:31] <taplar> i'd assume you could do it on anything deferred
[10:58:41] <lintguy> Ok, I'll try
[10:59:27] <sigdk> taplar, you 've mentioned it a couple of times... I don't understand the notion of "deferred" :)
[10:59:55] <taplar> you can think of a deferred object as being one that is processing asynchronously
[11:00:06] <taplar> it does not block other logic from happening
[11:00:35] <taplar> there are special methods associated with them that are called once the object is resolved with a success or error, or just always
[11:01:18] <taplar> http://learn.jquery.com/code-organization/deferreds/jquery-deferreds/
[11:02:18] <taplar> wth are the lean modal docs...
[11:03:27] <Xatenev> taplar: ^^
[11:03:47] <taplar> it doesn't look like they have an option to open it without a click....wtf
[11:03:58] <Xatenev> taplar: there is.
[11:04:14] <taplar> ?
[11:04:17] <Xatenev> did it somehow months ago, dont really remember how tho
[11:04:28] <taplar> i tried leanModal('show') didn't seem to do it
[11:04:34] <taplar> maybe open...
[11:06:17] <Xatenev> taplar: Can't you just trigger the click on the element? :O
[11:06:39] <taplar> well i'm wanting to change it to make the function he's doing on click return the deferred
[11:06:46] <taplar> so it'd be a direct call rather than a click
[11:07:13] <taplar> i guess the issue is he's tied his populate with the show
[11:22:35] <taplar> i don't really like it, but meh  https://jsfiddle.net/u03nhx81/61/
[11:33:25] <taplar> i'm tempted to fork it and mod it...
[11:37:03] <taplar> though there appear to be lots of pull requests, and it's not been updated since '12, :s
[11:48:48] <jquery302> good afternoon guys! why this work "$(day).css("border-color", "#f00"); $(day2).css("border-color", "#f00");"
[11:48:49] <jquery302> but not this "$(day, day2).css("border-color", "#f00");
[11:48:53] <jquery302> ?
[11:49:12] <taplar> what is day and day2?
[11:49:40] <jquery302> day = "#edit-field-turno-di-lavoro-und-0-value"
[11:49:50] <taplar> so strings
[11:49:54] <jquery302> day2 = "#edit-field-turno-di-lavoro-und-0-value2
[11:50:03] <jquery302> yes
[11:50:15] <taplar> $(day +","+ day2)....
[11:50:31] <jquery302> oh!
[11:51:32] <jquery302> yes man! thanks!
[11:51:36] <taplar> sure
[11:51:45] <jquery302> but, why?
[11:51:56] <taplar> two operators vs 1
[11:52:03] <taplar> err, inputs
[11:52:26] <jquery302> ok ok thanks again!
[11:52:34] <taplar> you could also try $(day).add(day2)...
[11:52:49] <jquery302> I will do
[11:53:49] <jquery302> it doesn't work
[11:53:55] <taplar> bah :(
[11:53:57] <jquery302> I have a ).css after
[11:54:15] <jquery302> this works 						$(day + "," + day2).css("border-color", "#f00");
[11:54:26] <jquery302> not this 						$(day).add(day2).css("border-color", "#ccc");
[11:54:36] <robertmaxrees> are day and day2 selectors or jquery objects?
[11:54:43] <jquery302> selectors
[11:55:06] <robertmaxrees> weird.  add should work fine.
[11:55:26] <jquery302> I mean that ).css works only for day2
[11:55:44] <robertmaxrees> $(day).add(day2).css("border-color", "#ccc"); should work, too. hrmm.

[11:57:46] <jquery302> mmm
[11:58:17] <swedishfish> any datatablers up here?
[11:58:39] <taplar> they like to hide in dark corners
[11:58:49] <robertmaxrees> lol
[11:58:55] <awkwardCough> only waiting for a question to be asked
[11:58:59] <taplar> oh snap
[11:59:13] <taplar> awkwardCough: is now the resident expert
[11:59:19] <robertmaxrees> bummer.
[11:59:23] <jquery302> there was a problem in the precedent line of ).add
[11:59:29] <jquery302> thanks, I solved
[12:40:54] <jomofcw> Hello !
[12:41:35] <robertmaxrees> hello
[12:42:11] <jomofcw> Is there a way to avoid a "hover" event to tigger when the page just load and the mouse is already in the element, please ?
[12:47:02] <robertmaxrees> soooo tired this morning.
[12:47:11] <jomofcw> e.g. : i've got a dropdown menu, and when the user click on the main item (which carry the over element), the page load and when it's done, the dropdown display automaticaly because the mouse still be in the area of the main item.
[12:47:38] <robertmaxrees> jomofcw that's fine.  i wouldn't worry about that.
[12:47:45] <robertmaxrees> the user will know to move their mouse away
[12:48:17] <jomofcw> OK :(
[12:48:23] <robertmaxrees> why is that a bad thing?
[12:48:38] <robertmaxrees> fwiw you should be using mouseenter/mouseleave instead.
[12:52:32] <marti_> Hi! Is there a mentor about GSoC 2016
[12:53:00] <robertmaxrees> marti_ i'd head to #jquery-dev for that.
[12:55:08] <marti_> thank robertmaxrees
[13:07:44] <skyFlix> Can someone tell me, why >> $('#main').on("click", '.ajax-loaded-content', function(){ … << works but >> $('#main').on("load", '.ajax-loaded-content', function(){ … << doesn't ??
[13:07:56] <robertmaxrees> because the load event isn't firing.
[13:08:00] <jomofcw> Thanks robertmaxrees :).
[13:08:14] <skyFlix> is there a way around itß
[13:08:15] <skyFlix> ?
[13:08:38] <robertmaxrees> skyFlix now without manually triggering it, but why not just call the code you want in the .then() of your ajax call?
[13:08:58] <taplar> hold on, i didn't think load propagated out
[13:09:03] <robertmaxrees> that too.
[13:09:17] <skyFlix> hmm … can't. Ajax is in an other script I wich i cant alter
[13:09:30] <robertmaxrees> skyFlix then you want to look at global ajax events.
[13:10:18] <skyFlix> :-|
[13:13:19] <skyFlix> well … thx guys
[13:13:28] <robertmaxrees> sure.  pretty easy stuff to do.
[13:17:52] <taplar> trying a new thing.  standing up after 30 mins.  goes by really fast, :s
[13:50:22] <sigdk> does this function guarantee that it will return not before the ajax call has finished ? (I found it on stackoverflow)
[13:52:27] <taplar> which one?
[13:54:08] <sigdk> taplar,  oh sorry... http://paste.debian.net/417755/   :)
[13:54:31] <taplar> don't do async false
[13:54:59] <taplar> that will lock up the window for the duration of the request
[13:55:29] <sigdk> well... at least it will be correct
[13:55:37] <taplar> it will be terrible uxz
[13:55:39] <taplar> ux
[13:55:52] <taplar> i showed you a couple ways earlier that were doin git
[14:00:17] <decx> do you ever do this stuff? https://jsfiddle.net/decx/aLc8p20j/
[14:01:03] <taplar> 'you'?
[14:01:09] <decx> y'all?
[14:01:13] <decx> ^^
[14:01:21] <taplar> occasionally
[14:01:34] <decx> what's that pattern called
[14:02:16] <taplar> not sure.  if anything it seems like it'd be a callback pattern or something
[14:02:50] <decx> right
[14:03:52] <taplar> that's kind of interesting though to think about.  the different patterns of giving the callback, vs returning the deferred to do whatever with
[14:04:52] <taplar> i guess giving the callback leans more towards obscurity maybe?
[14:07:29] <decx> i used it when i didnt know if mydataplz was a get or a node
[14:08:08] <decx> and then in my logic i check if it's a function and do the callback thing or init directly
[14:32:15] <rtd1123> Is there an easy way to drag the side of an element, to extend it to the right or left, as opposed to dragging the entire element?
[14:32:54] <robertmaxrees> if you're using JQUI, there's a resizable.
[14:33:00] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, you'll probably need a plugin.
[14:33:05] <rtd1123> yah, I'm using UI
[14:33:15] <robertmaxrees> https://jqueryui.com/resizable/
[14:33:37] <rtd1123> robertmaxrees, Thank you!
[14:33:59] <robertmaxrees> thank google - it was the first response ;)
[14:34:19] <taplar> your first born is now forfeit
[14:34:37] <awkwardCough> thats how I lost my son to amazon :/
[14:34:40] <rtd1123> I google'd for extend side of element, or something like that
[14:34:45] <rtd1123> I failed miserably on all accounts
[14:34:49] <robertmaxrees> hahaha
[14:34:53] <robertmaxrees> it's all good mang.
[14:35:10] <rtd1123> I always try to search before asking, I don't like to waste people's time
[14:35:19] <taplar> that's where we differ
[14:35:21] <robertmaxrees> awesome.  i'm just being smarmy.
[14:35:23] <rtd1123> haha
[14:36:06] <awkwardCough> yeah man, its the fact that you do search that is appreciated... you may not always know the correct wording but its not bad to do the work then ask a directed question :)
[14:36:45] <robertmaxrees> i totally appreciate people taking the modicum of effort.
[14:37:15] <rtd1123> for sure, if someone asked like "is there a resizable method in jQuery", I'd probably get pissed
[14:37:30] <rtd1123> because they obviously even had the right keyword and didn't google it
[14:38:03] <robertmaxrees> right?!
[14:39:10] <taplar> jQuery, resizable,.......... help me please *enter*
[14:39:33] <rtd1123> exactly
[14:39:44] <taplar> how did it return me porn?
[14:39:44] <awkwardCough> to be fair that is why I like the site http://lmgtfy.com/
[14:39:48] <taplar> *bookmarks for later*
[14:40:05] <rtd1123> long time favorite
[14:40:30] <taplar> i like it, but i rarely use it.  really meant for those times you don't care to be a douche, :D

[14:41:10] <Penorsaurus> http://pastebin.com/j14jr5FL
[14:41:19] <Penorsaurus> I am having some issues with this function
[14:41:26] <Penorsaurus> I'd li ke to to return true or false
[14:41:31] <Penorsaurus> but it never does
[14:41:44] <taplar> ajax doesn't 'return'
[14:41:56] <taplar> your async.  no where to return to
[14:41:59] <Penorsaurus> evem if I set async to false?
[14:42:12] <taplar> you shouldn't do that, but sure, that'd be the exception
[14:42:23] <Penorsaurus> even so
[14:42:28] <Penorsaurus> it still doesn't return true or false.
[14:42:28] <decx> do the thing
[14:42:40] <Penorsaurus> console.log(get_item_geographic(item.id)) should return true or false, correct?
[14:42:43] <taplar> ^ pass true or false into whatever needs it
[14:43:02] <taplar> not if it's async
[14:43:07] <Penorsaurus> if (get_item_geographic(item.id)){ is never triggered.
[14:43:35] <Penorsaurus> I have async set to false.
[14:43:36] <decx> you return from teh closest function
[14:43:45] <Penorsaurus> yet both of those conditions never ha ppen.
[14:43:48] <decx> not your get item function
[14:44:05] <taplar> ah, yeah, so you'd need to set a var outside and return that
[14:44:13] <taplar> if your doing the async false
[14:44:17] <decx> https://jsfiddle.net/decx/aLc8p20j/
[14:44:19] <Penorsaurus> set a var outside of get_item_geographic?
[14:44:21] <decx> heheh
[14:44:31] <taplar> lol
[14:44:46] <Penorsaurus> I see.
[14:45:37] <Penorsaurus> decx, so in your example, i would return within the "stuff" function
[14:46:03] <decx> it's whatever you put in response
[14:46:32] <Penorsaurus> decx, so I would have to call my get_item_geographic from another function?
[14:46:52] <decx> maybe just do it normally first
[14:47:41] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/ob7x69t8/
[14:48:57] <Penorsaurus> taplar, so dosomething would be a seperate function
[14:49:03] <Penorsaurus> that based on its input, returns true or false?
[14:49:03] <taplar> yep
[14:49:04] <decx> no that'S the callback
[14:49:16] <taplar> another function passed in
[14:49:37] <taplar> doesn't have to be named 'doSomething'.  that's just the parameter name
[14:49:39] <decx> you apply the function like geo_item_geo('myitem', function(){ do this with my item })
[14:49:44] <taplar> ^
[14:50:16] <decx> now your function gets 2 arguments
[14:50:22] <decx> item and a function
[14:50:34] <Penorsaurus> https://jsfiddle.net/Le1xwr80/
[14:50:35] <decx> and it executes that function with whatever you put in doSomething()
[14:50:40] <Penorsaurus> is there a downside to handling it this way?
[14:50:56] <taplar> as opposed to?
[14:51:09] <decx> no
[14:51:13] <decx> what
[14:51:51] <taplar> looks like you undid the callback
[14:52:31] <taplar> and what's with the if(conditional) return true else return false?  just return (conditional)
[14:52:52] <decx> return from success?
[14:52:56] <decx> returning there makes no sense
[14:53:07] <taplar> no, i'm just pointing out a peeve of mine
[14:53:32] <decx> right
[14:55:07] <taplar> but like decx was saying, with that model, your returning from success, not from the outer method
[14:56:05] <Penorsaurus> taplar, you mean I am using a seperate function?
[14:56:21] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/Le1xwr80/1/
[14:57:39] <Penorsaurus> i see
[14:58:18] <Penorsaurus> thanks guys.
[14:58:24] <albedoa> can anyone recommend a recent boilerplate for small-scale jQuery plugins? there are a few out there, but it's hard to tell whether they are good or applicable to all projects
[14:58:51] <taplar> learn might have one, dunno
[14:58:53] <robertmaxrees> the learning center has that for you.
[15:01:36] <taplar> albedoa: are you familiar with that site?
[15:01:49] <albedoa> taplar that's where i started, good site
[15:01:54] <taplar> good deal
[15:02:03] <albedoa> taplar other boilerplates had instantiators and other concepts
[15:02:22] <robertmaxrees> albedoa what are you trying to build?
[15:02:31] <robertmaxrees> because you may not need to use the plugin pattern at all.
[15:02:45] <albedoa> robertmaxrees just a small card sorting plugin
[15:03:09] <taplar> card sorting?
[15:03:14] <albedoa> user attaches it to an element, plugin does the rest
[15:03:20] <albedoa> yeah like animate cards
[15:03:22] <albedoa> not playing cards
[15:03:28] <albedoa> div cards
[15:03:42] <taplar> like story cards?
[15:03:51] <albedoa> nah forget i said cards
[15:03:55] <taplar> :)
[15:04:00] <albedoa> :P
[15:04:17] <albedoa> press a button, divs move around
[15:04:26] <robertmaxrees> like isotope?
[15:04:29] <albedoa> yeah
[15:10:02] <Penorsaurus> what is the correct way
[15:10:08] <Penorsaurus> to check if an array is empty or undefined
[15:10:28] <robertmaxrees> you should always have an array.
[15:10:34] <robertmaxrees> and you check its length
[15:11:28] <Penorsaurus> data.geographic.length > 0 ?
[15:11:43] <robertmaxrees> you can just do if (data.geographic.length)
[15:11:50] <robertmaxrees> 0 is falsy.
[15:12:02] <Penorsaurus> Cannot read property 'length' of undefined
[15:12:27] <robertmaxrees> then you first need to check if (data && data.geographic && data.geographic.length)
[15:12:39] <robertmaxrees> though that's a weird API if you aren't always getting back an array.
[15:12:50] <Penorsaurus> its json ri ght
[15:12:54] <Penorsaurus> if a field is there
[15:12:58] <Penorsaurus> it returns an array
[15:13:05] <Penorsaurus> if its not there, it returns undefined (or nothing)
[15:13:09] <Penorsaurus> how should I catch that?
[15:13:11] <robertmaxrees> it should return an empty array.
[15:13:14] <robertmaxrees> and i just showed you.
[15:14:23] <Penorsaurus> robertmaxrees, what is weird is
[15:14:28] <Penorsaurus> when it returns "undefined"
[15:14:32] <Penorsaurus> it still sets it to true.
[15:14:35] <robertmaxrees> it's ok to type in full sentences btw.
[15:14:37] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[15:14:52] <robertmaxrees> and i know nothing about the api you're handling, so it's hard for me to know what that statement means.
[15:15:05] <Penorsaurus> http://pastebin.com/m81CQ9pd
[15:15:39] <Penorsaurus> I guess I should check if the object exists...
[15:15:39] <taplar> you don't need the inner if
[15:15:51] <robertmaxrees> you realize that line 32 will run before the ajax call finishes, right?
[15:16:09] <taplar> he's doing async false
[15:16:15] <robertmaxrees> uh
[15:16:27] <robertmaxrees> welp.
[15:16:32] <taplar> he's adamant about it
[15:16:40] <robertmaxrees> then all bets are off.
[15:16:56] <robertmaxrees> and lines 17-25 are repeating a lot of work.
[15:17:44] <Penorsaurus> robertmaxrees, taplar I think the issue here is that the API, if the geographic field doesn't exist, will just return "undefined"
[15:17:55] <robertmaxrees> you're confusing things.
[15:17:56] <robertmaxrees> one sec.
[15:17:58] <Penorsaurus> so the check should really be if data has a "geographic" field.
[15:18:19] <robertmaxrees> https://bpaste.net/show/36a5d68ec770
[15:18:23] <robertmaxrees> this is literally all youneed.
[15:19:37] <Penorsaurus> robertmaxrees, an undefined field will still return true.
[15:19:44] <robertmaxrees> no it won't.
[15:19:45] <Penorsaurus> "data" in parsed json.
[15:19:48] <robertmaxrees> unless it's returning as a string.
[15:19:51] <Penorsaurus> it does because i am seeing it.
[15:20:03] <robertmaxrees> that's pretty awful.
[15:20:05] <Penorsaurus> google console shows it as "undefined" (i.e. geographic doesn't exist)
[15:20:21] <robertmaxrees> you should reach out to whoever defined that api and have them fix it.
[15:20:25] <taplar> "undefined" or undefined?
[15:20:27] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, string comparisons ahow.
[15:20:29] <robertmaxrees> *ahoy
[15:20:32] <Penorsaurus> undefined
[15:20:35] <robertmaxrees> sahre an example of the data.
[15:20:37] <Penorsaurus> no quotes.
[15:20:56] <Penorsaurus> https://repository.library.northeastern.edu/api/v1/files/neu:180625
[15:21:11] <Penorsaurus> this has a geographic.
[15:21:16] <robertmaxrees> show me one that doesn't.
[15:21:18] <Penorsaurus> so it should return true.
[15:21:27] <Penorsaurus> geographic just isn't there.
[15:21:41] <robertmaxrees> in which case what i just showed you will work.
[15:22:06] <Penorsaurus> let me show you an example
[15:22:10] <robertmaxrees> >.>
[15:22:16] <robertmaxrees> if it's not there, then it'll be falsy.
[15:22:17] <robertmaxrees> you'll be fine.
[15:22:29] <Penorsaurus> https://repository.library.northeastern.edu/api/v1/files/neu:194444
[15:22:32] <Penorsaurus> here is an example.
[15:22:41] <robertmaxrees> right.
[15:22:42] <Penorsaurus> there is no geographic field.
[15:22:45] <robertmaxrees> right.
[15:22:52] <robertmaxrees> what i showed you before will properly handle that.
[15:22:57] <Penorsaurus> it doesn't.
[15:23:00] <robertmaxrees> prove it.

[15:23:37] <Penorsaurus> console output.

[15:25:48] <Penorsaurus> I am going to run that and see what happens.
[15:26:14] <taplar> you know line 13 is doing an assignment right?
[15:26:32] <Penorsaurus> you mean line 12?
[15:26:43] <taplar> gah, sorry, 3
[15:26:55] <robertmaxrees> if(response = true) { will always be true.
[15:27:02] <taplar> not sure why your doing a comparison anyway....
[15:27:05] * taplar is dieing
[15:27:12] <Penorsaurus> lol
[15:27:19] <Penorsaurus> I'll just return the output.
[15:27:21] <Penorsaurus> wow.
[15:27:30] <robertmaxrees> Penorsaurus you're familiar with truthy vs falsy, right?
[15:27:44] <Penorsaurus> nope.
[15:27:52] <robertmaxrees> that explains a lot.
[15:28:16] <taplar> http://james.padolsey.com/javascript/truthy-falsey/
[15:28:44] <Penorsaurus> taplar, I'll take a look
[15:28:46] <Penorsaurus> thanks again guys.
[15:29:01] <robertmaxrees> in js, there are 6 falsy values - ie values that coerce to a false: they are false, null, undefined, 0 (the number), '' (empty string), and NaN
[15:43:04] <huck5> if I'm using something like $( "#accessProtection" ).dialog( "close" ); to navigate between popups - do any bound-events (like `keyevent`) remain when the dialog is closed?
[15:43:19] <taplar> should
[15:44:07] <huck5> taplar, ok, thanks. What's the easiest way to unbind keyevent listeners? I'm looking `removeEventListener`, but it looks like it wants me to pass in a function to unbind? Is there a way to do this without passing in a second param?
[15:44:27] <robertmaxrees> are you using jquery or raw js?
[15:44:27] <taplar> if you don't give a function it removes them all iirc
[15:44:32] <huck5> robertmaxrees, jquery
[15:44:38] <robertmaxrees> then you want .off()
[15:44:57] <huck5> robertmaxrees, and pass in "keyevent" as a param (or something to that extent)? I'll look into it now, thanks
[15:45:32] <taplar> i take it your reusing a dialog for different things?
[15:46:33] <huck5> taplar, well, prior to opening the dialog I'm using jQuery to bind the "Enter" key to a submit button. I thought it would be a good idea to Unbind the keyevent listener when the button has been clicked, to ensure that pressing "Enter" on another page doesn't try and trigger that button.
[15:47:02] <robertmaxrees> "on another page" - why not verify that the event emitted from the right place.
[15:47:12] <huck5> robertmaxrees, could you suggest how I might go about this?
[15:47:32] <robertmaxrees> event.target is the element the event emitted from.
[15:47:40] <huck5> robertmaxrees, thank you
[15:48:22] <taplar> or you might could use one()
[15:48:38] <robertmaxrees> true, though I like to avoid juggling bindings.
[15:48:42] <taplar> yeah
[15:48:51] <taplar> originally i was going to suggest a delegate maybe
[15:49:49] <taplar> heh, or if it's not going to be used again, destroy the dialog entirely
[15:50:20] <taplar> or detach, *shrug*
[15:51:55] <huck5> Hm... Ok! Thanks for all your suggestions. Definitely gives me enough to go on!
[16:12:51] <taplar> i don't know how you can be sleepy robertmaxrees with all this excitement
[16:14:38] <taplar> neighbor rooms are calling the mods, saying we need to take it down a notch
[16:17:12] <spoonUltra> Doesn't sublime have a plugin that will let me measure pixel distance in a variety of port views?
[16:17:56] <taplar> not sure
[16:19:49] <taplar> are you just trying to see the page in different view sizes?
[17:14:33] <jose3_> I am having issues with Masonry, any of yall ever use it?
[18:22:47] <Whiskey-> How do i select the first id that comes after current selected class
[18:22:52] <robertmaxrees> wut
[18:22:59] <robertmaxrees> you can only have an ID once on a page.
[18:23:53] <Whiskey-> talk to me?
[18:23:56] <robertmaxrees> yes.
[18:24:12] <Whiskey-> what does that has to do whit the thing
[18:24:23] <Whiskey-> if i select a class whit name "A"
[18:24:31] <Whiskey-> and there is a next class whit name "B"
[18:24:45] <robertmaxrees> show some html.
[18:24:49] <Whiskey-> and then its a id whit name "C"
[18:25:01] <Whiskey-> it most be a way to select the first id that comes after
[18:25:12] <ZoiX> Whiskey: you can use find()
[18:25:20] <robertmaxrees> that doesn't sound like what he's trying to do.
[18:25:23] <Whiskey-> find what?
[18:25:27] <Whiskey-> find (id) ?
[18:25:31] <robertmaxrees> find is for children.
[18:25:37] <robertmaxrees> if you have the ID already, just use it.
[18:25:42] <ZoiX> Whiskey: yes.
[18:25:49] <ZoiX> robertmaxrees: it sounds better
[18:25:50] <Whiskey-> but thats not the one thats selected
[18:25:50] <robertmaxrees> $('#theIDHere') - don't use find for that.
[18:25:59] <ZoiX> Agree
[18:26:24] <ZoiX> There is just one ID on a page. Why do you want to select the first one? I mean, it is the only one
[18:26:33] <robertmaxrees> hence my original question.
[18:27:08] <Whiskey-> ooo i see
[18:27:18] <Whiskey-> no i mean the first id that comes after the current selected class
[18:27:28] <robertmaxrees> the first element that has any ID, you mean?
[18:27:45] <Whiskey-> yeh
[18:27:48] <robertmaxrees> show us some html.
[18:27:51] <robertmaxrees> lots of ways to do that.
[18:28:01] <Whiskey-> i don´t really have any and its like shit
[18:28:02] <robertmaxrees> different options are better depending on what your html looks like.
[18:28:12] <robertmaxrees> actually you do have some and i'm not going to play guessing games today
[18:28:13] <robertmaxrees> :)
[18:29:19] <Whiskey-> but https://jsfiddle.net/9e6s9pnm/ <-- dataViewBox-Hashes is the selected class and i need to grab the id after it
[18:29:21] <geoid> hi
[18:29:42] <robertmaxrees> Whiskey are these inside of a share dparent element?
[18:29:47] <robertmaxrees> because they should be if they're related.
[18:30:10] <Whiskey-> i don´t know what that means but yeh its alot more before it
[18:30:19] <geoid> How can I get dynamic property names for an object in jQuery or js.
[18:30:23] <geoid> ?
[18:30:33] <robertmaxrees> geoid jquery isn't a language, javascript is.
[18:30:41] <robertmaxrees> and you use square bracket notation for that -
[18:30:54] <robertmaxrees> myObjectName['foo' + anyStringHere]
[18:31:23] <robertmaxrees> Whiskey i suggest that because you could .closest() to that parent and then .find() the class you want.
[18:32:10] <Whiskey-> no i need the id
[18:32:13] <Whiskey-> not the class
[18:32:21] <robertmaxrees> you can get the ID by getting the element via class.
[18:32:31] <robertmaxrees> .prop('id') - there's your ID.
[18:32:40] <Whiskey-> $(".dataViewBox-Hashes").hover(function() { is what i use now
[18:33:02] <Whiskey-> $(this).prop(id) ?
[18:33:06] <robertmaxrees> no.
[18:33:12] <robertmaxrees> so do these share a parent element.
[18:33:24] <robertmaxrees> like https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/0gnmvrpo/1/ ?
[18:34:13] <Whiskey-> wtf give me a break, that was not the code i give you
[18:34:15] <Whiskey-> and stop hack my computer !!!
[18:34:19] <Whiskey-> yeh something like that :)
[18:34:21] <robertmaxrees> ... huh?
[18:34:39] <robertmaxrees> okay...  so just .closest() and then .find() to get the element you want.
[18:35:47] <robertmaxrees> though really you should just stick that data in a data attribute on that parent div and read it from there.
[18:37:06] <Whiskey-> :&
[18:39:19] <geoid> robertmaxrees: when try that I get "unexpected token [". It doesn't like the square bracket.
[18:39:36] <robertmaxrees> geoid show me.
[18:40:03] <geoid> http://codepen.io/geoidesic/pen/qZrLKd robertmaxrees
[18:40:32] <robertmaxrees> you can't do that.
[18:40:45] <geoid> I noticed :)
[18:41:15] <robertmaxrees> show me an example object that is what you expect for your end result.
[18:41:25] <robertmaxrees> becuase data[bc.formId]['expenses']: makes very little sense./
[18:42:58] <geoid> robertmaxrees I've just updated that same link, you'll see the comment now points out the desired object.
[18:43:17] <robertmaxrees> "data[UserBudget][expenses]" still not making sense.
[18:43:37] <Whiskey-> robbyoconnor: don´t see this working https://jsfiddle.net/0gnmvrpo/3/
[18:43:52] <geoid> robertmaxrees it's just a string
[18:44:00] <geoid> that's the property name
[18:44:10] <geoid> the final property name that I want
[18:44:20] <robertmaxrees> D: that's.. nasty. but ok.
[18:44:22] <robertmaxrees> 1 sec.
[18:44:55] <robertmaxrees> so unless you're using ES6, you have to do bc.text["data[UserBudget][expenses]"] = test;
[18:45:08] <robertmaxrees> Whiskey bad autocomplete.
[18:45:13] <robertmaxrees> Whiskey ...
[18:45:19] <robertmaxrees> $(this).closest().find("id") really?
[18:46:03] <robertmaxrees> Whiskey how would you select that element with CSS?
[18:46:21] <geoid> robertmaxrees but I can't use the text "UserBudget"... that's the dynamic part that needs to be from a variable.
[18:46:33] <robertmaxrees> geoid then concat it.
[18:46:39] <Whiskey-> no clue but this is current class o i don´t really see well javascript are not my best language :/
[18:46:50] <geoid> robertmaxrees that's what I'm trying to do :)
[18:46:57] <robertmaxrees> Whiskey so you don't understand how css selectors work?
[18:47:00] <geoid> and failing
[18:47:06] <robertmaxrees> geoid bc.text["data[" + UserBudget + "][expenses]"] = test;
[18:47:29] <Whiskey-> i don´t see what css has to do whit this
[18:47:35] <robertmaxrees> Whiskey .find() takes a selector.
[18:47:43] <robertmaxrees> you feed it the same kind of things you'd use in CSS>
[18:47:45] <robertmaxrees> give it a classname.
[18:48:02] <robertmaxrees> .find('.dataViewBox-HideShowButton') for instance.
[18:48:08] <Whiskey-> yeh
[18:48:12] <Whiskey-> bit if you don´t know the name
[18:48:18] <Whiskey-> do you really have to give it a name?
[18:48:22] <robertmaxrees> you should.
[18:48:28] <Whiskey-> i try to avoid that
[18:48:30] <robertmaxrees> otherwise you have no reliable way to select it.
[18:48:31] <Whiskey-> that was the point
[18:48:37] <robertmaxrees> you shouldn't avoid giving it a class.
[18:48:46] <robertmaxrees> if the ID can change, you want a class to select it with.
[18:49:00] <Whiskey-> the id will always be correct and in same place
[18:49:07] <robertmaxrees> but will it change?
[18:49:07] <Whiskey-> but i need to have it selected no matter what the name is
[18:49:14] <Whiskey-> yes it can change
[18:49:17] <robertmaxrees> right, so use a class to identify that element.
[18:49:20] <robertmaxrees> that's my entire point.
[18:50:03] <Whiskey-> anyways, i still need to know how to do it. It will always be correct anyways
[18:50:09] <Whiskey-> even if its bad practice
[18:50:14] <robertmaxrees> uh.
[18:50:16] <robertmaxrees> that's how you di it.
[18:50:19] <robertmaxrees> give it a class and select it.
[18:50:37] <robertmaxrees> otherwise you need to .closest() then use .children() and .filter() to the one with an ID.
[18:52:43] <Whiskey-> robertmaxrees: $(this).closest().children().filter("id") ?
[18:52:55] <Whiskey-> naaa closest need to have id in it right
[18:52:59] <robertmaxrees> you need to give .closest() a selector.
[18:53:05] <robertmaxrees> and filter() would take a function.
[18:53:07] <robertmaxrees> read the docs.
[18:53:18] <robertmaxrees> "id" is looking for <id> - that's not what you want.
[18:54:25] <Whiskey-> :(
[18:55:46] <geoid> thank you robertmaxrees!
[18:55:49] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[18:58:45] <Whiskey-> i don´t get it
[18:58:52] <robertmaxrees> what aren't you getting?
[18:59:32] <Whiskey-> everything
[18:59:44] <robertmaxrees> that's not helpful ;)
[18:59:48] <arc_> it's easier to help you if you're more specific
[18:59:51] <robertmaxrees> ^
[19:00:01] <robertmaxrees> we're giving you answers but you're rejecting them for some strange reason.
[19:00:13] <Whiskey-> well i try everything i can come up whit
[19:00:20] <robertmaxrees> so show us what you're doing.
[19:00:56] <Whiskey-> last i try was $(this).closest($(this)).prop("id")
[19:01:03] <robertmaxrees> no.
[19:01:09] <robertmaxrees> did you read the documentation for closest?
[19:01:14] <Whiskey-> and find insted of prop
[19:01:19] <Whiskey-> yeh some time
[19:01:26] <robertmaxrees> i don't believe you ;)
[19:01:31] <robertmaxrees> .closest() takes a selector.
[19:01:55] <Whiskey-> but its allredy the closest
[19:01:57] <Whiskey-> $this are the closests
[19:02:02] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[19:02:08] <robertmaxrees> do you understand what closest() does?
[19:02:13] <Whiskey-> damit
[19:02:27] <Whiskey-> yeh it select the closets*?
[19:02:44] <robertmaxrees> it looks for a parent element that matches that selector.
[19:02:48] <robertmaxrees> starting at the current element.
[19:03:08] <Whiskey-> always backwords?
[19:03:28] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/closest/ -> For each element in the set, get the first element that matches the selector by testing the element itself and traversing up through its ancestors in the DOM tree.
[19:04:14] <Whiskey-> $(this).closest(".dataViewBox-DownloadLink").find("id")
[19:04:17] <Whiskey-> something like that then
[19:04:20] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[19:04:28] <Whiskey-> ffs, that is parent
[19:04:32] <robertmaxrees> .find("id") is looking for <id>
[19:04:42] <robertmaxrees> use a class there instead.
[19:05:03] <Whiskey-> but i don´t have any?
[19:05:18] <Whiskey-> hmm i do
[19:05:24] <robertmaxrees> ...
[19:05:38] <arc_> deep breaths
[19:05:41] <Whiskey-> so
[19:05:41] <Whiskey-> $(this).closest(".dataViewBox-DownloadLink").find("dataViewBox-HideShowButton")
[19:05:50] <robertmaxrees> it's a selector homeskillet :)
[19:05:52] <Whiskey-> well whit a .
[19:05:55] <robertmaxrees> right.
[19:06:07] <robertmaxrees> assuming ".dataViewBox-DownloadLink" is the shared parent element.
[19:06:15] <decx> did you do the learn and try things
[19:06:37] <Whiskey-> yeh that should work
[19:06:41] <Whiskey-> it still don´t select the id
[19:06:52] <robertmaxrees> you then use .prop('id')
[19:07:09] <Whiskey-> yeh
[19:07:16] <robertmaxrees> right.
[19:08:07] <Whiskey-> https://jsfiddle.net/0gnmvrpo/4/
[19:08:20] <robertmaxrees> no.
[19:08:36] <robertmaxrees> .dataViewBox-DownloadLink doesn't contain dataViewBox-HideShowButton.
[19:08:42] <robertmaxrees> you need to go "up" one more levent.
[19:08:58] <robertmaxrees> s/levent/level
[19:08:58] <b-ot> Correction, <robertmaxrees> you need to go "up" one more level.
[19:10:28] <Whiskey-> aaa
[19:10:29] <Whiskey-> thanks :D
[19:10:35] <robertmaxrees> check out the docs next time.
[19:10:42] <robertmaxrees> they have all this information in them.
[19:10:58] <Whiskey-> yeh, i normally do problem is i never understand
[19:11:08] <robertmaxrees> learn.jquery.com is a great resource for you, them.
[19:11:11] <robertmaxrees> i'd go through the tutorials.
[19:11:45] <Whiskey-> :)
[19:14:36] <Whiskey-> works perfect, thanks robertmaxrees
[19:14:41] <robertmaxrees> sure.
[19:25:29] <saganbyte> Hello folks, is there some way to find out if a method will be deprecated in the near future
[19:26:21] <robertmaxrees> the blog.
[19:26:24] <robertmaxrees> and the api docs.
[19:29:03] <saganbyte> robertmaxrees: thanks, so if the blog and the docs dont suggest anything of that kind on say, the getScript method, is it safe to assume that it wont be depracated any time soon?
[19:29:21] <robertmaxrees> you mean https://api.jquery.com/jquery.getscript/ ?
[19:29:52] <robertmaxrees> i mean, the devs could announce today that they're getting rid of all convenience methods, which would kill that.
[19:29:54] <robertmaxrees> but basically.
[19:30:45] <saganbyte> yes that s the one alright robertmaxrees
[19:30:57] <robertmaxrees> i'd avoid using that in the first place, but meh.
[19:33:09] <saganbyte> robertmaxrees: aha i see... any specific reason? i have an endpoint that explicitly returns some scripts that i need to http get and then run in global scope as soon as recieved
[19:33:31] <robertmaxrees> why not just include references in your html?
[19:34:11] <saganbyte> robertmaxrees: the scripts need to be generated dynamically.. especially their sequence.
[19:34:19] <robertmaxrees> UUUH
[19:34:22] <robertmaxrees> that's pretty scary.
[19:34:44] <saganbyte> they are basic string mangling functions and they ll be run once on the server (node) and their output be stored in session
[19:35:01] <saganbyte> then the scripts in the correct sequence will be sent to the client
[19:35:07] <robertmaxrees> generating JS is a bad idea
[19:35:20] <saganbyte> they ll be run again and their value be compared at a later time against the value stored on the sever
[19:35:29] <robertmaxrees> that's a very strange way to do that.
[19:35:34] <saganbyte> Yes i m aware of that but this is a very specific case
[19:35:37] <robertmaxrees> you're basically working against everything JS is good at.
[19:35:49] <saganbyte> yes but with good reason i assure you :)
[19:35:59] <robertmaxrees> i highly doubt it ;)
[19:36:12] <robertmaxrees> either way, i'd look at using require or something else in the case.
[19:36:39] <saganbyte> can i use requirejs to load the scripts whihc are served from an endpoint?
[19:36:51] <saganbyte> basically there is no JS file on the endpoint
[19:37:02] <robertmaxrees> i'm not entirely sure - maybe?  you really need to find something that isn't jquery for this is my point.
[19:37:12] <robertmaxrees> because otherwise you're going to have all kinds of race conditions and other worries.
[19:37:43] <saganbyte> i had initially loaded them via a script tag
[19:38:12] <saganbyte> but i was running into a timeout issue for another aspect of the app which had a SLA that was to be observed strictly
[19:38:28] <robertmaxrees> then you need something much more reliable than getScript.
[19:38:41] <saganbyte> can you recommend something, i m open to options
[19:38:46] <robertmaxrees> not jquery?
[19:38:47] <robertmaxrees> :)
[19:38:50] <saganbyte> :)
[19:38:50] <robertmaxrees> i'm not sure what all is out there.
[19:38:57] <robertmaxrees> but you need something to manage external dependencies.
[19:39:06] <robertmaxrees> require may be able to offer that.
[19:39:10] <saganbyte> i see
[19:39:50] <saganbyte> since this is not the requirejs channel maybe i ll search around a bit to see if require will let me load scripts as opposed to a JS file
[19:40:09] <robertmaxrees> yeah - head over to their channel and see if they can offer any insight, too.
[19:41:27] <saganbyte> sure... and thanks for your time robertmaxrees
[19:41:33] <robertmaxrees> absolutely :)
[19:56:33] <geoid> if I use .slideup to hide certain fields on the form then jquery.validate plugin will only validate fields that are not hidden. Is it possible to get the slideup effect to add a class of 'hidden' instead of setting display:none ?
[19:56:49] <robertmaxrees> that sounds incorrect to me.
[19:56:54] <robertmaxrees> jquery validate should still work.
[19:57:14] <robertmaxrees> and what would the hidden class do instead of the display none?
[19:58:12] <geoid> robertmaxrees it could do visibility:invisible instead of display:none
[19:58:19] <robertmaxrees> that's not valid css ;)
[19:58:26] <robertmaxrees> and just animate the height in that case.
