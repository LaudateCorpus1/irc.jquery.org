[00:20:32] <jl2753_>  Hi, I'm trying to cycle through a list of different paragraphs with a next button, but not sure what's wrong here. Could someone point me in the right direction? http://jsfiddle.net/jl2753/eL2Bg/
[00:24:45] <grafi> jl2753 http://jsfiddle.net/eL2Bg/3/ try it like this
[00:25:43] <grafi> jl2753 first problem was $('#paragraph_list') has no .next('p')
[00:25:58] <grafi> jl2753 .next() only finds silbings not children
[00:26:58] <jl2753_> grafi: ah that makes a lot more sense- so that's why you used .children
[00:27:10] <jl2753_> grafi: awesome, so much more clear now. Thank you!
[00:27:33] <grafi> jl2753 http://jsfiddle.net/eL2Bg/4/ also this, no need to toggleClass twice ;)
[00:28:43] <jl2753_> grafi: thanks ;) i'm just happy that it works, been stuck on this for a while. now just time to digest and see if i really understand it
[01:44:15] <jomofcw> Hello ^^ !
[01:45:14] <jomofcw> I've got a question not really related to jQuery but... on the jQuery website I could see that some script has an SRC like that "//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.9.1/jquery.min.js". And so, the browser automaticaly replace the "//" by "http://" ?
[01:45:47] <grafi> or by https://
[01:45:54] <pixelpimp> if you're in http, yes.  if you're in https, no.
[01:46:03] <Cork> jomofcw: or any other protocol
[01:46:05] <pixelpimp> it goes to whatever scheme you're on
[01:46:12] <grafi> or by file:// as we have learned yesterday xD
[01:48:05] <xqo> does .append("<div>stuff</div>") return the new div?
[01:48:39] <Cork> xqo: no
[01:48:47] <Cork> it returns the element you ran append on
[01:48:54] <Cork> (or elements)
[01:49:44] <xqo> ok thank you
[01:49:55] <xqo> whats the easiest way to select my new div?
[01:50:20] <Cork> var newElm = $('<div>stuff</div>'); append(newElm);
[01:50:33] <jomofcw> OK thanks you =).
[01:54:30] <xqo> ok thank you
[02:01:04] <jomofcw> And, please Cork, is that avalaible for each element or only the src attribute of the script element ? (about the "//")
[02:01:33] <Cork> jomofcw: it works for all resource references
[02:02:00] <Cork> jomofcw: it is specified in the same place as the absolute and relative url schema
[02:02:05] <jomofcw> Cork OK thanks ! So I've got to update my framework. Thanks for your precious help ^^.
[02:02:23] <jomofcw> I miss this point :/.
[02:42:42] <sunbeam> is there a site like web.archive.org that DOES have images?
[02:42:44] <sunbeam> or more images
[02:50:04] <koneko> sunbeam, how is that a jQuery question? :)
[02:50:40] <koneko> I don't know any, though
[02:51:29] <koneko> And the archive is the biggest one I think
[02:52:10] <sunbeam> ok
[02:54:19] <ph88> i have an html table that's inside a div with overflow: scroll ... how i can move stuff around the table (mouse drag) and i would like the scroll area to scroll if i start dragging. Is there a good library for this? Or is this something i am better of creating myself ?
[02:54:46] <ezln> good day, i am a bit confused about binding multiple callbacks to the same event. Is there any order in which the callbacks are called? can i maybe force the order of callbacks by using promises?
[02:55:14] <Cork> ezln: first in first out; if it's on the same element
[02:55:22] <ezln> aah alright, thanks!
[03:00:04] <ezln> Cork: thanks again, that solved the understanding problem i had :)
[03:08:47] <ph88> so i have a scrollLeft method ... how can i make it so that it scrolls faster the further away of the element the mouse is ?
[03:09:26] <joroci> got a fiddle?
[03:09:55] <Serdar> hi all
[03:10:52] <Serdar> I am looking for a "popup" solution which appears in front of all, when appeared. Is this possibble with jquery/jqueryui?
[03:11:20] <Cork> Serdar: you can do that with pure css if you like
[03:11:30] <Cork> but if you want a more advanced solution you can use jquery ui dialog
[03:11:59] <Serdar> I took a look on it, but I don't see a method like focus or something
[03:12:41] <Cork> Serdar: well no, but there is show
[03:13:00] <Cork> and there is moveToTop
[03:13:19] <ph88> joroci: not yet .. i'm just contemplating what strategy i should use to go about the problem
[03:14:15] <Serdar> huh, why I didn't see that
[03:14:36] <Vorspire> (ph88): speed = distance / time
[03:14:37] <Serdar> maybe this will work, thanks
[03:15:56] <ph88> anyone an idea how i can keep scrolling a scrollable area while holding mouse down ?
[03:16:29] <Vorspire> assume you should be scrolling until you receive mouseup?
[03:17:09] <ph88> yes
[03:17:59] <ph88> and actually the position of the mouse determine to which direction and how fast it should scroll
[03:18:15] <ph88> someone must have implemented this before :| i just don't know where to google for
[03:19:39] <ph88> so i can use .animate() or i can manually adjust the position ...
[03:23:59] <joroci> you could have a div inside another div and set his position
[03:26:53] <jned> I have var somestring = "sometring";  and I have <li id="somestring"></li>, can I do $("#"+somestring).remove(); ??
[03:28:48] <sQVe> jned: Yup.
[03:28:55] <joroci> ya
[03:29:11] <jned> sQVe, joroci thx

[03:30:46] <SudoAptitude> I would like the user to select a picture with an <input type="file">, parse the picture to BASE64 and process this string within a javascript function without reloading the page. is that possible?
[03:32:15] <jned> can you have for an id name id="somestring:num" ?
[03:34:27] <Aamir> jned: its not a valid selector I think. If you use css or jQuery to select it, they will take anything after : as Pseudo class
[03:34:54] <jned> ok thx
[03:36:53] <Aamir> SudoAptitude: Try http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17710147/jquery-js-get-input-file-image-in-base64-encoded
[04:36:10] <mls_> hi there
[04:38:13] <mls_> general question about javascript script loading : When I want to use external lib, such as jquery, can I load those library when the onload event is triggered w/o impacting my document.ready() function ?
[04:46:26] <Cork> mls_: no, jquery needs to see the domcontentloaded or onload event else it won't ever fire .ready
[04:48:04] <mls_> Cork: so I can't delay my jquery script loading ? I'm asking because google pagespeed gives me a "!" with my scripts loading into the head section
[04:48:32] <Cork> mls_: you can, if you don't use jquery for handling page load
[04:50:46] <mls_> Cork : well, if I move my JS code from top to bottom of my page, can I assume the code will be executed after the page is loaded (as it is at the end of my page) and then that I don't need to use document.ready() to work with my elements ?
[04:51:16] <Cork> mls_: yes, you can
[04:51:26] <Cork> you can't depend on there order of loading though
[04:51:32] <mls_> Cork : so, when should I use document.ready ?
[04:52:11] <mls_> I though it was something to use when we wanted to be sure about the presence of dom elements... but if putting my JS at bottom is enough.. ?
[04:52:21] <Cork> it's a function that will fire when or if domcontentloaded or onload has fired
[04:52:56] <Cork> mls_: when you put scripts at the bottom the dom will exist before the script starts parsing
[04:53:04] <Cork> so by definition the dom will exist
[04:53:19] <Cork> BUT it also means you can't do things before the page draws
[04:53:42] <Cork> so bottom of page is in between domcontentloaded and onload
[04:53:44] <mls_> Cork : so users will actually see the changes I'm doing in JS ?
[04:53:55] <Cork> mls_: there is a chance yes
[04:54:06] <Cork> as the page update isn't blocked by the scripts
[04:54:14] <ryorky1> what regex can I use to match the following string:  2 Ct Tw Size 08.00.  I have this so far to match the digits:  /^[0-9]+(\.[0-9][0-9])$/
[04:54:19] <Cork> (that is the point of putting the script at the bottom)
[04:54:32] <ryorky1> how can I add it in to match the string?
[04:54:47] <ryorky1> of Size ?
[04:54:50] <Cork> ryorky1: what parts is it you want to match
[04:55:28] <ryorky1> Cork:  Size 08.00 or it could possibly be Size: 08.00
[04:56:02] <mls_> Cork : ok thanks. So I can assume I should only keep by example my jquery script loading in the head, and the document.ready function should only content dom modification I want to apply before user can see it. All EventListeners, tests, and validation lib could be at bottom of my page and loaded after the dom.
[04:56:38] <Cork> js> print('Size:' + '  2 Ct Tw Size 08.00'.match(/[0-9]\.[0-9]+/)[1])
[04:56:42] <b-ot> Cork: Size:undefined
[04:56:45] <ryorky1> Cork:  so, it would need to match the following examples:  2 Ct Tw Size 08.00 or  2 Ct Tw Size: 08.00
[04:57:49] <Cork> js> print('Size: ' + '  2 Ct Tw Size 08.00'.match(/[0-9][0-9]\.[0-9]+/)[0])
[04:57:55] <b-ot> Cork: Size: 08.00
[04:58:02] <ryorky1> Cork:  but I need it to match the word size as well
[04:58:12] <Cork> why?
[04:58:21] <Cork> there is nothing in there to force that
[04:58:41] <Cork> if you match two digits followed by a dot you will only match that section
[04:59:01] <ryorky1> Cork:  I'm trying to figure out how to get it to match the string plus the digits
[04:59:24] <Cork> js> print('Size: ' + '  2 Ct Tw Size 08.00'.match(/[^ ]+ [0-9][0-9]\.[0-9]+/)[0])
[04:59:31] <b-ot> Cork: Size: Size 08.00
[04:59:33] <Cork> js> print('  2 Ct Tw Size 08.00'.match(/[^ ]+ [0-9][0-9]\.[0-9]+/)[0])
[04:59:39] <b-ot> Cork: Size 08.00
[05:00:46] <ryorky1> b-ot:  any ideas?
[05:00:46] <b-ot> ryorky1: outlook not so good.
[05:00:55] <Happzz> are there timers for jquery?
[05:01:04] <Happzz> to update some table every N seconds or so
[05:01:16] <joroci> maybe some addon
[05:01:22] <Cork> ryorky1: check the code i just posted
[05:01:24] <grafi> o√¥

[05:03:14] <jop008> I have a date field which I want to prefill and show the data in format dd-MM-yyyy
[05:03:22] <jop008> how to do this?
[05:04:41] <joroci> what kind of field normal input?
[05:04:42] <joroci> text
[05:05:33] <ryorky1> Cork:  there's a paren missing somewhere in there:   print('  2 Ct Tw Size 08.00'.match(/[^ ]+ [0-9][0-9]\.[0-9]+/)[0])
[05:05:42] <ryorky1> nm
[05:06:58] <joroci> jop008?
[05:07:35] <jop008> so I have this value 23-2-1964 how to prefill this and show it in this format
[05:07:57] <jop008> the prefill must be in yyyy-mm-dd but how to show it differently?
[05:08:17] <joroci> it's the same value everytie?
[05:08:18] <joroci> time
[05:09:24] <Happzz> grafi i tried settimeout, like this: window.setTimeout($.pjax({url: '/ajax/calls', container: '#ajaxTable'}), (20*1000));
[05:09:34] <Happzz> it ends up executing immediately
[05:09:59] <grafi> wrap it in a function() {}
[05:10:29] <Cork> Happzz: setTimeout takes a function reference if you do funcName() the function will be executed
[05:10:49] <Cork> while funcName will send a reference that later can be called
[05:10:59] <Cork> this is how javascript works
[05:11:43] <Happzz> okay, thanks
[05:14:31] <jop008> is the date format depending on browser region settings?
[05:14:56] <jop008> I want all dates in dd-mm-yyyy on my iste
[05:15:20] <Cork> jop008: if you want a specific format on dates you will have to create the date your self
[05:15:38] <jop008> How to do this?
[05:15:50] <jop008> With prefill there is only one format
[05:15:53] <Cork> data.getYear()
[05:16:00] <Cork> and then build the result string
[05:16:04] <Cork> ?mdn date
[05:16:05] <b-ot> Cork: Date - JavaScript | MDN - Mozilla Developer Network ‚Üí https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date
[05:16:23] <jop008> the prefill must always be in yyyy etc
[05:16:30] <jop008> so year coming first
[05:16:31] <chilversc_> jop008: by date field, do you mean <input type=date> ?
[05:16:39] <jop008> yes
[05:16:42] <Cork> ah
[05:16:50] <Cork> that depends on the browser
[05:16:54] <chilversc_> jop008: you don't set the display format, the browser handles that
[05:16:54] <Cork> and it's locale
[05:17:30] <jop008> okay how I can I check this in chrome?
[05:17:58] <chilversc_> jop008: <input type=date value="2013-11-04"> ?
[05:20:03] <chilversc_> jop008: exactly what you get depends upon the browser, one cavat though, if the browser doesn't understand type=date, then it falls back to type=text, and the user will have to enter the date in ISO 8601 format
[05:21:23] <jop008> ugly implementation lot of code needed

[05:31:12] <__equinox> rmurphey: exactly what I needed, thanks
[05:31:51] <Cork> notmoose: you would have to use the new file api
[05:32:00] <Cork> notmoose: note though it won't work in older ie's
[05:32:28] <Cork> (like ie9)
[05:33:00] <__equinox> rmurphey: is the request executed parallely?
[05:33:10] <rmurphey> notmoose: you may want to read http://stackoverflow.com/questions/166221/how-can-i-upload-files-asynchronously-with-jquery

[05:36:15] <chilversc_> is there anyway to make focus behave correctly when using jquery-ui sortable? http://jsfiddle.net/8T5U9/

[05:56:35] <Cork> preventDefault() doesn't stop the other event listeners
[05:56:46] <ph88> oki
[05:56:49] <joroci> it's kinda by the name
[05:56:54] <joroci> an event handler isn't default
[05:56:58] <ph88> how could i find out what event is stopping some functionality ?
[05:57:42] <ravenzz> if (e.isDefaultPrevented()) { console.log("foo"); }
[05:57:52] <jop008> <input type="date" val="1970-12-31"> on chrome doesnot present this date

[05:58:46] <jop008> Tried value also
[05:59:05] <jop008> Okay works with value
[06:03:02] <ezln> hm, how exactly does the context parameter for the $() selection work? for example, if i do: var mySelection = $("input"); and then: $('input', mySelection), i get an empty array. shouldn't i get all elements of mySelection?
[06:03:34] <rmah> no
[06:03:42] <shoky> ezln: $('input', mySelection)  is exactly the same as  mySelection.find('input')
[06:03:54] <rmah> shoky: is it?
[06:03:55] <ezln> indeed it is
[06:03:58] <shoky> it is
[06:04:03] <rmah> astounding
[06:04:08] <ezln> and mySelection si a group of inputs
[06:04:12] <ezln> so why is it empty?
[06:04:23] <shoky> .find  is for finding descendant elements
[06:04:30] <ezln> descendand! duh!
[06:04:35] <shoky> inputs don't have descendants elements, especially not other inputs ;p
[06:04:36] <ezln> thanks for clarification :)
[06:04:37] <rmah> doh
[06:04:38] <ezln> yeah
[06:04:50] <ezln> alright, thanks a lot

[06:35:43] <chilversc_> its one of the few places where I still think browser detection is required, since feature detection would tell you it is supported, but cannot tell you it is supported badly

[07:02:36] <seutje> try $(document).on('click', '#my_tickets a', function(e) {...});
[07:03:08] <seutje> making document the static part and '#my_tickets a' the dynamic bit
[07:05:56] <joroci> where is the htmkl?
[07:05:58] <joroci> html
[07:06:10] <joroci> oh that was weird
[07:09:33] <Velveeta> please tell me "what is google" wasn't a serious question
[07:10:55] <joroci> :)
[07:11:35] <ravenzz> is there any way to prevent this to happen? http://jsfiddle.net/ssFbJ/
[07:12:02] <Velveeta> ravenzz: prevent what from happening
[07:12:51] <dukedave> Is there anything in jQuery to do:  Click button once, change button content to 'Sure?', click again, follow   ?
[07:13:14] <ravenzz> Velveeta I want to catch only the click on the div
[07:13:20] <dukedave> I see there's a confirm dialog in UI..
[07:13:32] <Velveeta> ravenzz: you mean you want to prevent it from bubbling up to other containers?
[07:13:37] <ravenzz> yep
[07:14:12] <Velveeta> `api stoppropagation @ ravenzz
[07:14:12] <b-ot> ravenzz: No matches.
[07:14:16] <Velveeta> damnit
[07:14:24] <ravenzz> not the case
[07:14:28] <Velveeta> here you go: http://api.jquery.com/event.stopPropagation/
[07:14:29] <ravenzz> I mean..
[07:14:31] <binaryking> hi guys
[07:14:44] <binaryking> I get html code from an AJAX get request
[07:14:56] <binaryking> then I use
[07:14:58] <binaryking>  $('#container').html(data);
[07:15:28] <ravenzz> Velveeta http://jsfiddle.net/ssFbJ/1/
[07:15:34] <binaryking> but instead of #container the new data gets added to body
[07:15:40] <binaryking> plz. help
[07:16:12] <Velveeta> ravenzz: ok?
[07:16:15] <ravenzz> Velveeta so I guess I should also catch clicks to the lable and input and stopPropagation
[07:16:20] <joroci> what do you mean added to body?
[07:16:25] <ravenzz> I am kinda dumb today
[07:16:42] <Velveeta> oh, you specifically only want the div container itself to be listening for clicks, nothing within it?
[07:16:56] <ravenzz> correct
[07:17:39] <joroci> body tag?
[07:17:46] <grafi> hi Velveeta
[07:18:00] <Velveeta> ravenzz: http://jsfiddle.net/ssFbJ/2/
[07:18:03] <Velveeta> heya grafi
[07:18:20] <binaryking> joroci: was that for me? then yes
[07:18:38] <joroci> maybe the html or data tags are not closed
[07:19:16] <ravenzz> Velveeta right, but then if I click on the label/input it doesn't log "eh"
[07:19:31] <Velveeta> right..........
[07:19:38] <binaryking> joroci: no the tags are closed I have the '#container' div and I want to update its content with ajax returned html code
[07:19:44] <grafi> left
[07:19:50] <joroci> yea i get it
[07:20:07] <ravenzz> Velveeta which is not what I am trying to do
[07:20:08] <Velveeta> ravenzz: that's what you said the desired behavior was‚Ä¶ if you want them to log 'eh', see the first example
[07:20:16] <Velveeta> well then be clear about what you're trying to do
[07:20:16] <joroci> is there a way to see the html and data ?
[07:20:35] <Velveeta> you said you specifically only wanted the div listening for clicks on itself, not any of its children
[07:20:35] <joroci> is there a way to see the html and data ?
[07:20:49] <Velveeta> because the first example had a listener for the div + children, which you said wasn't right
[07:21:34] <ravenzz> Velveeta my bad, anyway I want to log "eh" once
[07:21:49] <ravenzz> that's why I said it wasn't right
[07:23:11] <ravenzz> Velveeta in fact this is what I tried first http://jsfiddle.net/ssFbJ/3/
[07:23:49] <Velveeta> right, that works fine, except when clicking on the label, which apparently retriggers click on the input
[07:23:59] <ravenzz> exactly
[07:24:03] <ravenzz> that's the actual issue
[07:24:37] <Velveeta> here: http://jsfiddle.net/ssFbJ/5/
[07:24:48] <Velveeta> see if that matches what you're looking for
[07:24:49] <ravenzz> I could remove the for attribute and it would work but I don't want to do that
[07:24:54] <Velveeta> right
[07:25:18] <Velveeta> that seems a little wonky on the browser itself to use that method for checking a checkbox that's linked to a label
[07:25:30] <Quest> how can i be sure (debug) that did  a click event or some other even actually ran javascript? or is there an event or JS connected to a certain div/button/element?
[07:25:49] <binaryking1> joroci: http://pastebin.com/yNfhedK9 - the ajax code
[07:26:00] <ravenzz> Velveeta it is a bit odd, I didn't know about this behaviour
[07:26:12] <ravenzz> but thanks for your help
[07:26:16] <Velveeta> me either, i assumed it just set the checked property
[07:26:18] <Velveeta> no problem
[07:28:31] <rmah> so float or inline-block?  that is the question
[07:28:46] <ravenzz> inline-block
[07:28:53] <binaryking> joroci: $('body').html() returns the html code from the ajax request and no #container div at all
[07:28:54] <ravenzz> if you are doinf layouts
[07:28:58] <rmah> 1 vote for inline-block
[07:29:13] <ravenzz> and I'll show you why
[07:29:14] <ravenzz> 1 sec
[07:29:17] <rmah> ok
[07:29:43] <ravenzz> here you go http://jsfiddle.net/AY627/
[07:30:57] <rmah> ravenzz: what about the whitespace problem?
[07:32:38] <binaryking> anyone here who can help me out please
[07:32:48] <binaryking> ajax call problem
[07:33:01] <Thorn> hello
[07:33:04] <Thorn> how do I prevent page scrolling with jquery? $(window).on('scroll', function(e) { e.preventDefault(); return false; }); doesn't work in firefox or chrome
[07:33:18] <rmah> ravenzz: where does the -0.31em come from?
[07:33:24] <ravenzz> it is solved there, use the grid system from purecss.io or
[07:33:40] <ravenzz> rmah that's an hack
[07:33:55] <rmah> I mean why -0.31 and not -0.33 or -0.29?
[07:34:08] <rmah> I would think the width of the space depends on the font used
[07:34:19] <rmah> and font-size, of course
[07:35:11] <ravenzz> I am trying to find the article for you
[07:35:20] <ravenzz> rmah yeah
[07:35:41] <cevarief> Is there a way to trap global ajax handler before local handler? If global handler meets some criteria then it can prevent local handler to do an action
[07:36:21] <ravenzz> rmah if you look at the purecss.io grid system they reset the font-family to *somethingidontremember* and then they set it back
[07:36:32] <rmah> I see
[07:37:31] <ravenzz> you could also use display: table & sons
[07:37:54] <rmah> purecss.io looks good.  haven't seen it before
[07:38:59] <grafi> semantic-ui ftw ^^
[07:39:50] <ravenzz> yeah the base is great, the best I've seen so far among all the ui frameworks. They the do silly stuff when it comes to dropdowns and other ui components
[07:40:16] <rmah> you mean purecss does the silly stuff?
[07:40:57] <ravenzz> yeah, like with Menus or tables
[07:43:16] <krz> whats the opposite of slice?
[07:43:23] <krz> i.e. want to remove the last char?
[07:44:33] <ravenzz> no the tables look fine actually
[07:44:47] <ravenzz> rmah yeah overall it is a good framework I think
[07:45:07] <jparkton> krz pop()?
[07:46:16] <ravenzz> krz "foo".slice(0, -1)
[07:47:07] <krz> nvm
[07:47:07] <krz> ty
[08:01:05] <jugglinmike> scott_gonzalez: Would you mind updating my signature on the jQuery CLA?
[08:28:52] <myosotis> I want to grab the data from a form, add a couple of my own values, then submit it.
[08:29:24] <jaypitidi> I have an input text in a form and I want my website to show the contents of the input like a paragraph element with no input, but when I click the text or the containing div I want the input text element to appear so it can be edited how can I go about doing that?
[08:30:14] <myosotis> is there an easier way than generating an html element to append to the form before serialization, or converting my inputs to a query string and appending them to the data string?
[08:37:07] <joroci> html of page and data
[08:48:40] <chilversc_> myosotis: if its in a form, you could use the new FormData object
[08:48:53] <chilversc_> myosotis: just create one of those from the form, then add on your extra values
[08:49:05] <myosotis> I ended up just appending a hidden input to the form object before I call serialize
[08:49:15] <myosotis> but your approach intrigues me
[08:49:24] <chilversc_> myosotis: though using hidden inputs has an advantage that its supported without javascript (if you can put those inputs in there when generating the page)
[08:49:41] <myosotis> man, I feel like an idior
[08:49:43] <myosotis> idiot too
[08:49:54] <myosotis> there is no reason I can generate that static hidden input on the html side
[08:50:56] <myosotis> can't*

[11:38:22] <devslash> how can i manually simulate a mouse hover event on my css menu using jQuery
[11:39:43] <devslash> is anyone here ?
[11:39:50] <s2013> https://gist.github.com/ss2k/71a3cd82f365eacfdd37 how would ia ccomplish this?
[11:39:55] <s2013> im having a bit of an issue of doing this properly
[11:42:16] <wodim> hello, can you recommend me a good plugin for drag and drop image uploading?
[11:42:54] <Velveeta> anybody use the npm registry and having issues installing or updating packages right now? i wanna make sure it's not just my end of the world
[11:43:26] <Velveeta> devslash: .trigger('mouseenter')
[11:43:30] <BillCriswell> devslash: .trigger('mouseenter mouseleave') perhaps.
[11:43:46] <devslash> i tried that
[11:44:09] <Velveeta> devslash: are you trying to activate a css :hover rule, or trying to activate some hover js behavior?
[11:44:20] <devslash> im trying to activate a hover behavior
[11:44:31] <Velveeta> in css?
[11:44:37] <devslash> no
[11:44:37] <Velveeta> er, sorry, nevermind that question
[11:44:44] <Velveeta> so how did you bind up that behavior?
[11:44:57] <devslash> when you mouse over the company logo image, i want to simulate a hover on the menu next to it
[11:45:04] <devslash> what do you mean
[11:45:19] <devslash> i create my menu using purecssmenu.com
[11:45:21] <Velveeta> i mean, you have some hover listener attached to the menu next to it i would assume, right?
[11:45:26] <Anchakor> hi, is there some smart function which I can hook up to an input type submit which will send the form data via POST AJAX way and the processes the result with a callback?
[11:45:32] <devslash> yes
[11:46:03] <Velveeta> well that's a css :hover event then
[11:46:10] <Velveeta> you can't trigger that via javascript
[11:46:17] <Velveeta> er rather a css :hover rule, not event
[11:46:18] <devslash> not even jquery
[11:46:22] <devslash> ?
[11:46:24] <Velveeta> not even jquery, jquery is just javascript
[11:46:56] <Velveeta> you can modify your css rules some to make both a :hover pseudoselector *and* something like .hover on the li
[11:47:11] <Velveeta> and you can make javascript add a hover class to the li, and then have it triggered that way
[11:47:18] <Velveeta> but then it's not a pure css menu anymore
[11:47:44] <BillCriswell> Opps. Always accidentally click weird shit.
[11:48:12] <Velveeta> anchakor: $.ajax ?
[11:48:18] <mattinahat> anyone know why I can't get my JSON cross function? Here's what I'm trying to do: http://jsfiddle.net/C44D7/
[11:49:03] <Velveeta> mattinahat: you're trying to use a synchronous programming method with an asynchronous function call
[11:49:07] <soldoutactivist> ^
[11:49:27] <Velveeta> when you make the call to getConfigs, it's kicking off an ajax request and then immediately returning to the next line in your code, before the request has finished
[11:49:36] <mattinahat> ah.
[11:49:39] <Anchakor> Velveeta: I guess $('#form_id').on('submit'... and data: $(this).serialize() is the answer, right?
[11:50:09] <Velveeta> mattinahat: try something like this: http://jsfiddle.net/C44D7/1/
[11:51:01] <Velveeta> anchakor: you'd want to attach an on submit handler to it yes, like you have in that line, and then within it, make a call to $.ajax and probably pass this.action (the form post url), and yes, data should be $(this).serialize(), and then your success: callbackFunction
[11:51:32] <Velveeta> anchakor: you're also gonna want to receive the event parameter in that submit handler, and do event.preventDefault() to keep the form from doing an *actual* submit w/ a page load
[11:51:44] <mattinahat> Velveeta: Awesome. Thank you!
[11:51:48] <Anchakor> Velveeta: right, thanks! been looooong time since I did anything JS.
[11:52:10] <Velveeta> no problem you two :)

[12:03:22] <Serdar> it should open a modal window but it doesn't
[12:04:07] <Guest1791> I think I've sort of got it working, but sometimes it gets the dimensions, sometimes it doesn't.
[12:04:17] <Guest1791> I want to wait for the image to load first, not sure how to do this
[12:04:36] <Guest1791> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/7308288
[12:09:58] <soldoutactivist> Guest1791 Use something like PxLoader. But once an image is loaded, you can check its naturalHeight/Width

[12:31:30] <siovene> Hi. I'm having a problem with my page. Some of my code inside a $(document).ready block, is executed even before some images like background tiles are loaded!
[12:31:34] <siovene> How is that possible?
[12:37:49] <dashx> Hey gang, any datatable wizards here? I am wondering if theres a good way to have multiple data tables on a page all share the same column widths?
[12:40:46] <NoiseEee> dashx: css?
[12:41:20] <NoiseEee> siovene: iirc, $(document).ready doesn't really care if images (much less background-images) are loaded
[12:41:55] <siovene> NoiseEee, then what can I do? It looks bad because my page hasn't really loaded yet, and it's getting blocked by JS.
[12:41:55] <dashx> NoiseEee: right now datatables sets the width based on the data in the cell. If I use CSS to make both tables have hte same widths, I wont get that behaviour anymore
[12:42:27] <NoiseEee> siovene: move to window.loaded i suppose
[12:42:36] <NoiseEee> dashx: ahh oh well
[12:42:58] <Rohan_Bhangui> siovene: do somethignlike :    background: #000 url("path/to/image.png");
[12:43:20] <Rohan_Bhangui> or if you must have images load.....reduce  its quality and save as jpg
[12:43:35] <Rohan_Bhangui> or use window.onload

[20:49:54] <vrlogrs> hi guys
[20:49:57] <vrlogrs> quick question ..
[20:50:46] <vrlogrs> if i empty a div using .html(), will all of its children's attached functions be removed automatically, or do i need to traverse them manually and .unbind() ?
[20:53:30] <vrlogrs> did that make sense? :S
[20:58:16] <AlfredBD> hola
[20:58:18] <AlfredBD>  espa√±ol ?
[21:08:08] <vrlogrs> nobody knows? :(
[21:21:20] <QL> I used jQuery.get(...) to fetch a page, then I use $(data) to parse the page, and jQuery just loaded all the gif, css files, how can I avoid that?
[21:48:15] <raj> what's a good way to link a tab to its content pane?
[21:48:37] <raj> vrlogrs, they'd be removed
[21:48:55] <vrlogrs> raj, are you sure?
[21:49:29] <raj> you can't bring them back
[21:49:30] <vrlogrs> no memory leaks?
[21:49:33] <raj> oh, like that
[21:49:42] <raj> ask in ##javascript
[21:49:55] <vrlogrs> i did, they werent sure either :S
[21:50:14] <vrlogrs> i guess i'll put in unbind(), just in case
[21:50:55] <raj> vrlogrs, http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6033821/do-i-need-to-remove-event-listeners
[21:51:34] <vrlogrs> aha, ok, thanks
[21:51:35] <uknownalgorithm> i'm having some real trouble trying to do this, how can i loop through an array and grab a value from each element and join them together in a string split by (,).
[21:52:00] <uknownalgorithm> 14
[21:52:18] <raj> uknownalgorithm, whatchu have so far?
[21:53:25] <vinex08> hi! just want to get opinions. which do you prefer. 1. a toggle accordion menu   2. slide to the left menu (facebook style)
[22:03:06] <uknownalgorithm> how can i grab each value from an object in an array and append each value to a string, split by commas
[22:04:17] <uknownalgorithm> say i wanted to grab the videoArray[i].value of each object in the array
[22:42:08] <Whiskey> http://jsfiddle.net/Slaktarn/bQR4d/1/ <-- Anyone around that can check on this
[22:47:04] <sacho> what's wrong with it
[22:47:52] <Whiskey> i will have the box to work the same way as the first table
[22:48:29] <Whiskey> You see if you take show/hide
[22:49:29] <Seich_> uknownalgorithm: something like v = $.map(array, function(v) { return e.value }).join(','); should do the trick.
[22:51:09] <Whiskey> sacho, you get what i mean?
[22:51:36] <uknownalgorithm> @seich_, i'm trying v = $.map(playlistFormData, function(v) { return playlistFormData.value }).join(','); but i have mutliple objects in the array
[22:52:05] <uknownalgorithm> it should be return playlistFormData[i].value for each object in the array
[23:24:29] <Whiskey> http://jsfiddle.net/Slaktarn/bQR4d/3/ <-- Here is an example of my problem
[23:24:39] <Whiskey> It should show more clear what i need help whit
[23:36:57] <Whiskey> funny 816ppl online and no one response :D
[23:38:25] <pixelpimp> i don't think your issue is very clear.  i just closed the fiddle when i saw it, 'cause it looked like a lot to sift through.
[23:38:52] <Whiskey> naaa not really
[23:38:57] <Serdar> hello, I got one scenario and need an idea how to do it: I am writing a offering tool (HTML5, websockets, jquery) for my colleagues. they should receive a popup (like modal window / dialog box) and I want, that this should appear in front of all
[23:39:28] <Whiskey> The first example box, has two of 1/2/3 and it has equal size, that what i need jQuery to do automatic
[23:39:33] <Serdar> no matter what he is doing, writing a word document or reading a pdf. the browser should appear in front
[23:39:40] <Serdar> is this possible?
[23:39:56] <Whiskey> the second box is how it looks, when you don¬¥t set the width for it manually
[23:40:06] <pixelpimp> Serdar: certainly nothing you can control through the browser, thankfully
[23:40:14] <Whiskey> pixelgremlins, was that clear?
[23:41:14] <pixelpimp> Whiskey: not in the slightest.
[23:41:20] <Whiskey> pixelgremlins: you have this in CSS "#one {width: 86px;}/#two {width: 118px;}/#three {width: 126px;}"
[23:41:24] <Whiskey> that fix the widths for box 1
[23:41:29] <pixelpimp> also you are completing the wrongnick
[23:41:37] <Whiskey> but i need jQuery to do it automatic
[23:41:55] <Whiskey> nick?
[23:41:55] <Serdar> really? no way?
[23:42:45] <Whiskey> pixelgremlins, i can¬¥t be more clear then that
[23:43:07] <pixelpimp> ^- see last line
[23:43:19] <Whiskey> don¬¥t get it
[23:43:26] <pixelpimp> i can't really tell what you're doing here.  the only reference to #three is in a textarea?
[23:43:31] <pixelpimp> i am not pixelgremlins
[23:43:38] <Whiskey> ooo
[23:43:59] <Whiskey> pixelpimp: you see its two boxes right?
[23:44:15] <Whiskey> and you can open both, one of them have same width on the tds, and one has not right?
[23:45:29] <pixelpimp> oh, okay.  why is this a jquery issue and not CSS?
[23:45:41] <pixelpimp> you're just trying to make it a table?
[23:46:07] <Whiskey> well the information in this lines, are always going to be diffrent then you can¬¥t set the width as i did in first box whit "#one {width: 86px;}/#two {width: 118px;}/#three {width: 126px;}"
[23:46:18] <Whiskey> so then i need jQuery to set it for me
[23:46:29] <Whiskey> depends on whats in the table
[23:47:42] <Whiskey> + that CSS can¬¥t make that
[23:49:02] <Whiskey> pixelpimp: did it got clear what the problem was now :D
[23:49:45] <pixelpimp> sounds like a table.
[23:50:10] <Whiskey> it is a table now
[23:50:39] <Whiskey> but tables can¬¥t make equal size for 1/2/3
[23:52:07] <Whiskey> something need to do the math
[23:54:16] <Whiskey> pixelpimp: i don¬¥t think you get it
[23:55:03] <pixelpimp> i don't think i do, either.
[23:55:16] <pixelpimp> because what you've explained so far is standard table behavior
[23:55:22] <pixelpimp> and should require no intervention
[23:55:43] <grafi> dun dun duuuun
[23:56:14] <Whiskey> then why can¬¥t i make it work just whit a table :/
