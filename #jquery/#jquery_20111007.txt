[00:02:15] <ProLoser|Work> hallo
[00:02:20] <ProLoser|Work> i have a question
[00:02:29] <ProLoser|Work> if i create a closure object
[00:03:20] <ProLoser|Work> and then i extend it, specifically to create a 'sub-class', will it retain uh… hmm.. maybe i'm confused
[00:16:15] <ty2u> Hi there. I am having some trouble figuring this out. How can I make a div with overflow:auto scroll to the bottom as content is loading into it as the page loads and be able to scroll up afterwards and view the content?
[00:26:16] <ProLoser|Work> ty2u: what's the problem you're having?
[00:26:45] <Phrogz_> ajpiano: https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=69464
[00:28:09] <BinaryKitten> ty2u set the div's scrollTop to its scrollHeight - its height
[00:28:15] <IfTrueElseFalse> Anybody know why on http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/ the error callback is not called for jsonp? I read the note "Note: This handler is not called for cross-domain script and JSONP requests" but not why and what the alternative is
[00:29:20] <IfTrueElseFalse> I don't know if the question was answered a few hours back when I first asked I didn't get a response and after I went AFK ya'll got really chatty :)
[00:29:20] <BinaryKitten> IfTrueElseFalse the issue is that jsonP and cross-domain script are handled in the default browser layer rather than via xmlhttprequest
[00:30:02] <IfTrueElseFalse> BinaryKitten: the console log gives error 503, there is no way to catch that?
[00:30:05] <BinaryKitten> as such the browser won't tell the origin of the script creation any error that might occur during that loading
[00:30:15] <BinaryKitten> IfTrueElseFalse the console is in the browser
[00:30:35] <BinaryKitten> it can listen to it because it's in the browser, the jsonP etc type of scripts
[00:30:56] <BinaryKitten> they can't mainly due to security of your browser
[00:31:15] <BinaryKitten> and secondly due to the way that jsonP and other things are handled
[00:32:11] <IfTrueElseFalse> OK I understand it is the way it is because of security reasons
[00:32:36] <Es0teric> i have a question, why does the else block work and the if block doesnt? http://pastie.org/private/vkm6rk7jaawlduzfvquw
[00:32:54] <BinaryKitten> pretty much, you wouldn't want a script on a site to know more about what's going on than you do. Or be able to access/hook into things it shouldn't be able to
[00:32:55] <k1t> does anyone see why i am not able to get my masking filter to change after the keyup event? http://jsfiddle.net/BMDcD/1/  the default input mask i set works, but id like it to be dynamic... not quite sure
[00:33:30] <IfTrueElseFalse> Still there must be a way to get json objects from external sites and know if it was unsuccessful
[00:33:53] <IfTrueElseFalse> There must be solutions?
[00:34:10] <k1t> hmm
[00:35:17] <BinaryKitten> IfTrueElseFalse thought about the ?callback  methodology?
[00:35:25] <BinaryKitten> and possibly a timeout?
[00:36:08] <BinaryKitten> again depends on what you are doing, how you are doing it
[00:36:14] <IfTrueElseFalse> you mean wrap the ajax call in a setTimout
[00:36:26] <BinaryKitten> not Wrap no
[00:36:28] <Es0teric> i have a question, why does the else block work and the if block doesnt? http://pastie.org/private/vkm6rk7jaawlduzfvquw
[00:36:49] <IfTrueElseFalse> no wait
[00:36:51] <IfTrueElseFalse> sorry
[00:37:02] <IfTrueElseFalse> how would you time an ajax request
[00:37:06] <BinaryKitten> Es0teric asking the same question multiple times is not going to get it answered faster
[00:37:08] <Phrogz_> Es0teric: Because God hates your indentation.
[00:37:31] <IfTrueElseFalse> first set a var, change it on success and then if after a time it wasn't change call it unsuccessful
[00:37:37] <Es0teric> phrogz_, my indentation on the pastie is not my real indentation..
[00:37:44] <Es0teric> it looks cleaner in textmate
[00:37:58] <Phrogz_> Have pride in your pastie.
[00:38:50] <Phrogz_> Have pride in your tabs versus spaces indentation.
[00:39:29] <Es0teric> dude are you attempting to troll? lol
[00:39:40] <Phrogz_> No :)
[00:40:25] * Phrogz_ is cranky because he woke up 40 minutes ago to order an iPhone 4S and Apple's store is still offline. Time to go back to sleep, I guess.
[00:40:49] <Phrogz_> But: Es0teric, what do you mean "doesn't work"?
[00:41:10] <BinaryKitten> 4S?
[00:41:15] <BinaryKitten> for Steve?
[00:41:19] <Guest70791> i know right... why would you even buy one of those ;x
[00:41:51] <BinaryKitten> Guest70791 (aka Chris) want to change up your nick?
[00:42:10] <BinaryKitten> :)
[00:42:41] <Eaven> there
[00:42:51] <Kit-10> heh
[00:43:17] <BinaryKitten> silly machine
[00:43:27] <BinaryKitten> my other computer ousted me from my own nick
[00:43:28] <BinaryKitten> :p
[00:44:11] <Eaven> thats what was happening to me ;x
[00:44:14] <BinaryKitten> Es0teric it is difficult to see and read your code due to the way that tabs are represented
[00:44:30] <Phrogz_> …and so easy for you to edit the pastie and fix it.
[00:45:25] <BinaryKitten> Es0teric can you create a jsfiddle or jsbin post with your html as well and also where is this script?  is it in the <head></head> or somewhere in the body?
[00:48:27] <BinaryKitten> IfTrueElseFalse have you seen http://www.kendoui.com/blogs/teamblog/posts/11-10-04/using_cors_with_all_modern_browsers.aspx
[01:04:47] <IfTrueElseFalse> thanks BinaryKitten
[01:06:26] <Oggu> can I somehow use jquery's jsonp callbakc functionallity but force it to ask for the same callback every time?
[01:10:03] <k1t_> anyone know why keyup might be clearing the text field it's observing?

[01:13:27] <BinaryKitten> Oggu  are you passing the callback function in the call to the ajax?

[01:14:21] <NodeX> try the author website
[01:14:48] <Oggu> BinaryKitten: I can do it either way. I wish that jquery takes care of the jsonpcallback stuff and calls my callback. But I also want to be able to cache the resullt
[01:15:07] <k1t_> NodeX: there's no documentation on this
[01:15:13] <k1t_> NodeX: it's unique to my case, it seems

[01:16:42] <BinaryKitten> k1t_ what's the error?
[01:16:48] <NodeX> uses zoho doesnt it ?
[01:16:50] <BinaryKitten> i don't see one .. or am i missing something?
[01:17:15] <k1t_> BinaryKitten: I never said there was an error. I said there was a bug
[01:17:31] <BinaryKitten> ok, error bug... a bug is an error is it not?
[01:17:41] <BinaryKitten> what's the "bug" then, because i can't see one
[01:18:25] <k1t_> BinaryKitten: http://jsfiddle.net/HWyVZ/ if you type anything but 1's, it works fine and masks like 9999-9999-9999-9999. But if you enter a 1, it picks that up and changes the mask to something like 9999-999999-99999
[01:18:36] <k1t_> but the thing is, it clears the field before working
[01:18:38] <k1t_> then it works
[01:18:41] <k1t_> but not the 1st time

[01:21:42] <Spadeski> Would someone mind helping with jquery draggables?
[01:21:44] <k1t_> kinda peculiar heh
[01:22:14] <BinaryKitten> not really
[01:22:39] <BinaryKitten> the mask is changing up the content but it's not reading the value correctly when you change the mask
[01:23:00] <k1t_> hmm
[01:23:06] <Solow> Is this the place to ask jquerymobile questions?
[01:23:30] <k1t_> BinaryKitten: I tried setting the value myself, but it didn't work out
[01:23:31] <Spadeski> umm well i have 10 images i want too make a raning system by the order there in and when you drage one from this list to a certain image holder tag in html it will replace the photo as "profile picute" and change it in mysql ?

[01:24:41] <k1t_> to say the least
[01:24:43] <k1t_> lol
[01:24:51] <BinaryKitten> k1t_ i can see..
[01:25:02] <BinaryKitten> i'm reading through the plugin to see what can be done
[01:25:09] <BinaryKitten> or at least why it's doing what it is
[01:25:11] <Solow> BinaryKitten: Yeah that's what I thought. It just seems to be a little quiet in there.

[01:49:04] <JeppeMariager> Hey all… I'm looking into which jquery templating system to use for a new project… is it still jQote2 that is the prefered (and fastest)?
[01:51:51] <Oggu> How can I accomplish cached JSONP requests?
[01:52:55] <NodeX> Oggu : {cache:true}
[01:53:28] <Oggu> NodeX: But it will still come up with an unique callback every time
[01:53:42] <NodeX> pastebin your code
[01:53:56] <blackspotwiggins> Oggu, specify your own callback
[01:53:58] <NodeX> The data is cached not the callback
[01:54:12] <blackspotwiggins> NodeX, jsonp has different url each time, ofc its not cached
[01:54:42] <NodeX> Err if you specify it to have one yes
[01:54:43] <Oggu> blackspotwiggins: Can I get jquery to handle the callback and call the regular callback (just like when using jQuery's generated callback name)
[01:55:01] <blackspotwiggins> Oggu, dont think so
[01:55:08] <Oggu> But still let me give it the callback name
[01:55:27] <blackspotwiggins> well
[01:55:35] <blackspotwiggins> you do window.jsonpcallback = function() {}
[01:55:52] <blackspotwiggins> and data : { some: "data", callback : "jsonpcallback" }
[01:58:03] <Oggu> I would like jQuery to create that function for me and then call my regular callback with the right data
[01:58:12] <Oggu> just like when it is generating it's own callback name
[01:59:00] <Solow> I'm trying to find out why calling ".page()" causes errors (jquery mobile). But when I started looking for it, I found out that it's not inside of jquery mobile. Is page() a jquery thing?

[02:00:26] <Pallet> Oh brilliant
[02:00:32] <Pallet> thanks again ;)
[02:00:41] <NodeX> google is your friend
[02:06:42] <Pallet> Stupid question, is there another way of doing jquery.post()....
[02:07:07] <blackspotwiggins> Pallet, $.post :)
[02:07:07] <Pallet> I seem to be having an issue in IE9 on a customers site and I think it maybe a jquery issue
[02:07:19] <blackspotwiggins> it most probably is not
[02:08:00] <Pallet> If I rem the line out, it works, but if I leave it in, theres an issue
[02:13:45] <Pallet> blackspotwiggins, it looks like IE doesn't allow posts to a different domain
[02:15:50] <NodeX> No browser does in XMLhttp v1
[02:15:57] <NodeX> it's against security policy
[02:28:52] <toxz> hi! i do ajax calls with json format. sometimes i can see that users get responses with some numbers around the json. maybe from some internet relay or i dont know... 4000 {...} 0   - so i js its not valid json anymore. anyone knows this problem?
[02:29:37] <Hooloovoo> toxz: it's probably your server doing the funkyness.
[02:29:55] <toxz> no its not
[02:30:17] <toxz> by the way the script is running on 20 servers :-)
[02:30:58] <toxz> i send me invalid json reponses as email
[02:31:11] <toxz> also i saw this after the json: <!-- INVALID HTML --> <!-- Hier wurde vom GeNUGate-wwwrelay etwas geweeded -->
[02:31:13] <DarsVaeda> in a jquery dialog, can i hide the "X" to close the dialog?
[02:31:23] <DarsVaeda> *jquery ui
[02:31:47] <Hooloovoo> DarsVaeda: Yup. Just change the css.
[02:35:43] <DarsVaeda> "just"...can you specify this ^^
[02:36:39] <DarsVaeda> I mean I can put a display: hidden to the class but...what if some function changes that, isn't that a bit unsafe?
[02:50:37] <inad922> hello
[02:50:50] <inad922> Anyone using jquery with the google maps api?
[02:52:00] <inad922> I can't construct a map with new google.maps.Map($('#map_canvas').get(), options); but can with new google.maps.Map(document.getElementById('map_canvas'), options)
[02:52:11] <inad922> Anyone knows why this happens?
[02:52:50] <blackspotwiggins> inad922, use the second one
[02:52:54] <blackspotwiggins> it's faster anyway
[02:53:28] <inad922> blackspotwiggins: yeah but why can't I make it first with the first one?
[02:53:38] <Pallet> NodeX, I've moved the API that it was posting to, now it's all ok ;)
[02:53:43] <blackspotwiggins> inad922, you aremisusing .get()
[02:54:10] <inad922> blackspotwiggins: doesn't work either when I don't use get
[02:54:22] <blackspotwiggins> inad922, should it?
[02:54:45] <blackspotwiggins> if you dont understand what you are doing, go for the simpler one
[02:54:46] <inad922> blackspotwiggins: It should. Since it selects the same element as the second one
[02:55:00] <blackspotwiggins> using jquery because of the cool factor is not "cool"
[02:55:11] <blackspotwiggins> inad922, it should not.
[02:55:18] <blackspotwiggins> google maps api does not expect jquery objects
[02:55:29] <inad922> jquery selectors select all the elements which match the css selector provided to them don't they? What's the point I'm missing here?
[02:56:11] <blackspotwiggins> inad922, the point you are missing is, jquery objects are not the same as dom objects
[02:56:13] <inad922> I'm not using it for the cool factor. I use it for faster development. See the logo..
[02:56:27] <inad922> blackspotwiggins: But how can I convert them?
[02:56:34] <blackspotwiggins> yeah it's tons of faster to wrap getelementbyid
[02:56:41] <blackspotwiggins> inad922, read the docs.
[02:56:51] <inad922> thanks blackspotwiggins
[02:58:28] <inad922> ' <blackspotwiggins> yeah it's tons of faster to wrap getelementbyid'. Yea it is. If you don't see this I guess you're missing the point.
[02:58:49] <blackspotwiggins> inad922, native dom is ALWAYS faster than jquery
[02:58:58] <blackspotwiggins> if you dont see that, im sorry for you
[03:00:39] <inad922> I don't care much about speed I don't do many heavy calculations and I don't want to write tons of code to make it work. If I would agree with you there I should agree with that we should still code in Assembly because it can produce code faster than any other language.
[03:01:05] <blackspotwiggins> inad922, you can't do assembly in browsers
[03:01:25] <inad922> jquery is a library to fasten development not for making the javascript running faster.
[03:01:31] <inad922> blackspotwiggins: really?
[03:01:41] <blackspotwiggins> yes really
[03:01:44] <inad922> ..
[03:01:49] <Pallet> me again
[03:02:43] <blackspotwiggins> inad922, feel free to demonstrate how you run x86 (or any) assembly in a browser environment
[03:02:59] <aaronmcadam> haha
[03:02:59] <inad922> nacl?
[03:03:02] <inad922> kthx
[03:03:14] <aaronmcadam> such a pedant :D
[03:03:48] <Whirl3d> Hey all, when selecting multiple elements in the same jQuery, can you include multiple classes within one of the elements: like $(".error, .blank, .init.required")?
[03:04:00] <Pallet> NodeX, http://pastebin.com/7RLKKT0g
[03:04:22] <Pallet> thats code snipet is being called from a file in the same folder
[03:04:22] <Whirl3d> that way it wouldn't return elements with the init class that weren't also required?
[03:04:36] <Pallet> but it's not posting,
[03:05:04] <Pallet> there shouldn't need anything at the start ./ or anthing shouldf there ?
[03:05:11] <rndstr> does anyone of a snippet (or what I could search for) when I want my block to be positioned static while in viewport but absolute (pinned to the top) as soon as he goes out of the viewport
[03:05:40] <inad922> blackspotwiggins: but here is the simpler way to do that -> http://code.google.com/p/shellinabox/
[03:05:52] <inad922> install nasm and run the code..
[03:07:07] <blackspotwiggins> connecting to another shell is hardly running it in a browser
[03:07:22] <blackspotwiggins> if i understand correctly
[03:08:48] <blackspotwiggins> and that basic implementation still runs on javascript, not asm
[03:09:15] <bsod2> just write an x86 emulator in js
[03:09:37] <bsod2> ^.^
[03:09:38] <inad922> lol blackspotwiggins you know that js is an interpreted language don't you?
[03:09:46] <Pallet> please help
[03:10:02] <inad922> but you're just missing the point btw. I mentioned assembly for another reason
[03:10:09] <Pallet> I'm doing a post http://pastebin.com/7RLKKT0g
[03:10:14] <johnathanb> Has anyone used cleditor for jQuery?
[03:10:25] <Pallet> and I've got no path, because it's in the same folder
[03:10:38] <NodeX> ./
[03:10:44] <NodeX> ./secure_stat...
[03:17:01] <Pallet> NodeX, Ive just seen my actual problem
[03:17:29] <Pallet> basically, Iv'e written a widget the loads on customers sites
[03:17:41] <Pallet> and I need to post stats information to our server
[03:18:03] <NodeX> never going to happen with Ajax
[03:18:52] <Pallet> is there anything JSON type of thing that I can use
[03:19:05] <NodeX> not reliably cross browser
[03:19:19] <Whirl3d> does .removeClass handle multiple selectors as an AND or OR union? In other words, I want to remove both the 'init' and the 'active' classes from a field, can I use: someSelector.removeClass("init,active")
[03:19:24] <NodeX> best you can do is include a gif or something
[03:19:31] <blackspotwiggins> Whirl3d, like css
[03:19:47] <NodeX> and have your serverside (where the gif is requested) log the query string
[03:19:49] <blackspotwiggins> ah, sry i think it does AND with spaces
[03:20:38] <Haprog> http://imgur.com/gallery/VQWGU
[03:20:42] <Whirl3d> I think it does AND with 'classa.classb'
[03:21:01] <Whirl3d> blackspotwiggins, thanks for the reply.

[03:39:37] <johnline3> not sure how this is done
[03:40:27] <awesomenickname> define a variable like "var clicked_already = false", then change it
[03:41:25] <Haprog> or just unbind the function on execute

[03:44:00] <nVee> hey guys. Can I use the val() function to return only part of a string?
[03:44:31] <nVee> I tried $("element").val().slice() but it does not work
[03:45:02] <arminrosu> did you try substring?
[03:45:13] <nVee> i have not :)

[04:03:09] <ravenzz> my Q is how to make the twitter / www highlighting working
[04:03:10] <ravenzz> ?
[04:04:26] <ravenzz> Should I use two different elements?
[04:04:32] <nail_> what do you want to hilight?
[04:04:42] <nail_> when you hover twitter or www
[04:05:22] <ravenzz> both
[04:05:36] <ravenzz> when i hover twitter it should highlight @b
[04:05:43] <nail_> just fix your markup
[04:05:49] <ravenzz> and when i hover www it should highlight b.ar
[04:05:56] <ravenzz> nail_ how?
[04:06:04] <ravenzz> that's the point.
[04:06:28] <nail_> oh you mean they overlap?
[04:06:34] <ravenzz> yep
[04:08:04] <doup> hi there, I'm working with a sortable, and I'm trying to run a function one time once the sorting has ended. I've tried putting it on update event, but as I've connected lists it runs twice in some cases, I've also tried to put the function in "remove", but it doesn't run always as the sorting can happen within a connected list (hence there is not "remove" event)... any idea?
[04:08:17] <nail_> ravenzz: http://jsfiddle.net/NQ5Dh/1/
[04:09:26] <ravenzz> obviously! ty
[04:10:07] <nail_> no worries :)
[04:11:29] <burg> hello. if i use jquery ui datepicker as a calendar (and not a datepicker in form), how can i find if the user clicks on a day and what is the day he clicked on?
[04:11:32] <arminrosu> I'm getting "Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token :" errors on an ajax call (JSON generated by php)
[04:11:41] <arminrosu> can anybody please help?
[04:11:45] <arminrosu> http://jsfiddle.net/arminrosu/jRpHH/
[04:14:32] <ravenzz> nail_ is it better to use hover() and toggleClass() ?
[04:14:34] <Kambfhase> arminrosu: please check you JSON here: jsonlint.com
[04:16:01] <Kambfhase> JSON is not the same as JSONp
[04:18:14] <kiguane> Hi all! I've got a pb with window.height() giving me different numbers when I only change the window width..? Not sure what I'm doing wrong?!
[04:18:16] <kiguane> http://jsfiddle.net/kiguane/RADZL/
[04:18:53] <Kambfhase> new Object();
[04:19:00] <Kambfhase> m(
[04:19:18] <arminrosu> Kambfhase: the json lints ok (was my frst stop). i need jsonp to circumvent Access-Control Origin errors
[04:19:42] <Kambfhase> yeah, but you php generates JSON, not JSONp ;)
[04:19:53] <barfoo365> I have a jquery carousel running on a site but the css sprite drop down menu above it displays behind the carousel.  Would this be more likley a jquery issue or a css issue?
[04:20:11] <arminrosu> barfoo365: css issue. need to set z-index
[04:20:18] <kiguane> so = {}; sorry but I not good at scripting..
[04:20:57] <Kambfhase> kiguane: the rest of the cood looks good.
[04:21:25] <barfoo365> arminrosu : Thanks for that
[04:21:44] <Kambfhase> Fx gives me: Header Height: 80 / Window Height: 369 and Screen Height: 289 / Window Height: 369
[04:22:44] <kiguane> yeah but when you move the vertical bar to change the size of the window you'll see that the height change while you move left or right..
[04:23:27] <Kambfhase> ok, lol
[04:23:58] <Kambfhase> could be a scrollbar issue
[04:24:47] <kiguane> maybe...
[04:25:58] <kiguane> but on a test site whrere the scrollbars are always visible it does the same thing (firefox)
[04:28:26] <kiguane> But I think you're right since the difference is always 17 px..
[04:31:54] <rocktop> hello , how to animate an element to its width on page load ?
[04:32:35] <Kambfhase> kiguane: you could try to always show/hide the scrollbars
[04:32:42] <pvgrif> inside onready(), animate its property width with animate()
[04:35:14] <rocktop> pvgrif: I have each element with its width I need to animate it from width:0px to the real width for each one ?
[04:38:00] <pvgrif> rocktop: starting from 0 to the width you ve specified in the css?
[04:40:34] <kiguane> Ok thanks I'll try that but still I don't understand why window height is lesser at the end of the onresize than at the begining... but again I'm not good at logic!!
[04:40:39] <rocktop> pvgrif: how ?
[04:41:29] <pvgrif> rocktop: i was asking if thats what you want to do
[04:41:40] <rocktop> pvgrif: yes
[04:42:57] <rocktop> pvgrif: I have each element look like : <div class="bar" style="width: 15%"></div>
[04:43:45] <pvgrif> rockstop: create jquery object with all the elements you want to animate, selecting them by whatever it is they share, then in an each method get the css('width '), save it in a variable, then set its width to 0, then animate the width from its current width (0) to the width you stored in the variable
[04:43:52] <pvgrif> i think that would work
[04:53:49] <sylow-> I have an error in FF console: $(this).openBox is not a function . openBox exists though, I think it is because a conflict, but you could I find the conflict?
[04:54:22] <Kambfhase> ?paste @ sylow-
[04:54:23] <bot-t> sylow-, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/

[04:57:07] <sylow-> Kambfhase: http://paste.pocoo.org/show/488764/ is how the js file is build up
[04:57:57] <Kambfhase> looks ok.
[04:59:04] <pvgrif> rocktop:  i ll check it out
[04:59:06] <sylow-> Kambfhase: and it's used with an onclick -> onClick="return $(this).openBox();"
[04:59:29] <arminrosu> @Kambfhase: so I wrapped the json in an array, now I don't get token errors … but now I can't access the object ...
[04:59:29] <sylow-> so I think $ is overwritten somewhere
[05:03:49] <coldhead> does it work okay if you don't use onClick, sylow- ?
[05:06:49] <pvgrif> rocktop: http://jsfiddle.net/A3EAe/11/

[05:10:20] <kiguane> =)
[05:10:44] <coldhead> sylow-: what about if you replace $ with jQuery in your code
[05:10:57] <coldhead> jQuery(this)
[05:10:59] <coldhead> etc
[05:11:16] <Kambfhase> :)

[05:20:56] <Double_Rainbow> hello world
[05:21:14] <Double_Rainbow> can i delete an img tag with jquery?
[05:21:28] <Double_Rainbow> i tried div.hide()
[05:21:36] <Double_Rainbow> but the image is still here
[05:23:31] <adrianp> Double_Rainbow: is the <img> tag in the div?
[05:23:57] <Double_Rainbow> no, i meant that i hide the img tag
[05:24:12] <blackspotwiggins> why do you assume hide() removes anything..
[05:24:23] <Double_Rainbow> i dunno
[05:24:44] <adrianp> Double_Rainbow: hide() changes display property to none
[05:25:03] <adrianp> html is still there, but "removed" from the UI perspective
[05:25:17] <Double_Rainbow> adrianp: ya, but it does make the image disapper...dynamically
[05:25:32] <ty2u> hi there, how do i detect when content changes in a div while the page is loading? The $(this).change doesn't seem to work. For example I have content loading into the #updated div from the command console sending ob_flush though PHP and want to cause it to scroll to the bottom but be able to scroll up and view that content.
[05:25:37] <adrianp> what are you trying to accomplish exactly?
[05:25:57] <Kambfhase> arminrosu: in order to use JSONP you have to change your PHP a bit.
[05:26:02] <blackspotwiggins> Double_Rainbow is a help vampire
[05:26:14] <Double_Rainbow> when i upload and image, i makes the previous image disappear and shows the new image
[05:26:15] <arminrosu> Kambfhase: callback function?
[05:26:27] <arminrosu> just looked at the twitter json ...
[05:26:31] <Double_Rainbow> blackspotwiggins: what is a help vampire? i have all the codz
[05:26:37] <blackspotwiggins> Double_Rainbow, http://slash7.com/2006/12/22/vampires/
[05:27:21] <Kambfhase> yeah, when jQuery sends a JSONP request to your sever it passes a callback parameter
[05:27:29] <Double_Rainbow> i want help because i have an issue, cuz i have the feeling i am not doing it right
[05:27:36] <Double_Rainbow> you prove me wrong
[05:27:38] <Kambfhase> you need to wrap your JSON in a functioncall with that parameter name
[05:28:07] <arminrosu> Kambfhase: thanks. I totally ignored that :(
[05:28:24] <Kambfhase> hope this info helps
[05:29:58] <adrianp> "Note that I use .he. here in the general sense even though Help Vampires are almost exclusively male. It appears that male Help Vampire, drawn as it is to shiny technology, occupies an evolutionary niche that females of the species simply do not find desirable. " - Woman

[05:31:26] <Double_Rainbow> wut,, sorry
[05:32:29] <Double_Rainbow> http://pastebin.com/7d0HrezY
[05:32:44] <blackspotwiggins> adrianp, yea that's a bit shallow, but the mostly that thing is spot on
[05:33:20] <Double_Rainbow> picture_1 was a default image, once the upload is complete, jquery hides the orignal picture_1 img tag
[05:33:28] <Double_Rainbow> then shows the newly uploaded photo
[05:35:04] <adrianp> blackspotwiggins: it's spot on because the ratio of men:women on IRC
[05:36:45] <coldhead> 100% of the women i know are on irc
[05:37:06] <Kambfhase> 100% of 0 ist still 0.
[05:37:13] <adrianp> yea, but you don't represent a large % of the IRC population
[05:37:40] <coldhead> 100% of the people i know who claim to be women are on irc, Kambfhase
[05:39:08] <Kambfhase> women dont exist. just like elves and dwarfs dont.

[05:48:20] <adrianp> MickeySoFine: $.post
[05:48:23] <truce> Kambfhase i think it is returning true for the elements inside the target
[05:48:31] <blackspotwiggins> adrianp, nice try
[05:48:44] <adrianp> lol
[05:48:50] <blackspotwiggins> i'll let you know when i finish my facebook clone
[05:48:58] <MickeySoFine> adrianp, do I have to convert my form to JSON first though?
[05:49:05] <Kambfhase> truce: huh?
[05:49:21] <Kambfhase> ?serialze @ MickeySoFine
[05:49:25] <Lion31> I have li elements on page...each has different classes, amongs other "page_1" or "page_2" etc class.... and each li has an id set like this "c_444" as in ad number..... I have a number, how can I get which page is it on? the only possibility is to get the page_1(or _2, _3, etc) class and extract the num from that, how do I do that?
[05:49:32] <Kambfhase> damit bot-t.
[05:49:36] <truce> if($(e.target).not(".slidePane"))
[05:49:48] <adrianp> MickeySoFine: yes, see serialize
[05:49:59] <truce> but when i click inside the slidePane div
[05:50:04] <truce> it returns true
[05:50:17] <Kambfhase> weird
[05:51:11] <truce> yea
[05:51:11] <adrianp> Lion31: do you have any code to show?
[05:51:21] <Kambfhase> its a difference if you click in the .slidePane or in a div in the .slidePane!
[05:53:18] <truce> maybe because I have 3 slidePane
[05:53:26] <truce> let me apply that to the parent element
[05:53:40] <MickeySoFine> awesome! ty guys!
[05:54:07] <Double_Rainbow> i tried to remove() the img tag, still i get black image

[05:59:02] <Double_Rainbow> you stupid dicks, its because both the old image file and the new image file have the same filename, that is why the browser is going bonkers trying to generate my image, and none of you dicks was able to find it out, man i am much better than any of you guys
[05:59:13] <Double_Rainbow> and i found this out, myself
[05:59:30] <blackspotwiggins> im sorry we made you think
[05:59:59] <Double_Rainbow> yeah, now i can help others when they would encounter the same problem
[06:00:26] <Double_Rainbow> i would go like: are both image using the same filename, and they would go, omg you are right

[06:04:00] <aaronmcadam> tinymce is shit
[06:04:07] <aaronmcadam> the code it produces is awful
[06:05:17] <adrianp> aaronmcadam: I agree, if deadly_jquery is looking for syntax highlighting in textarea, there are better, less bloated ways to go about it
[06:05:47] <aaronmcadam> what's wrong with using an embedded gist or fiddle
[06:06:05] <adrianp> yeah i was going to suggest ripping off jsfiddle
[06:06:07] <adrianp> lol
[06:06:12] <blackspotwiggins> aaronmcadam, you need to invent some wheels, man

[06:20:26] <jarrod322> hi everyone
[06:20:34] <jarrod322> how could i count the number of elements in an array with jquery?
[06:21:37] <kborchers> jarrod322: no need for jQuery just do yourArray.length
[06:21:50] <jarrod322> ah length thx i thought i needed count ;p
[06:22:57] <jarrod322> i try to count the number of elements with this: http://pastie.org/2655327
[06:23:15] <jarrod322> but it doesent seem to increment the count any idea how i could increment it? or does it look for unique elements?
[06:23:36] <jarrod322> currently i just place "4" into the array exepected to become the array like "4","4","4",etc on each function call
[06:23:44] <antihero> does jquery nth child work on IE7/8?
[06:24:13] <blackspotwiggins> jarrod322, array.length and elements are not related
[06:24:29] <blackspotwiggins> there is no reason why changing dom changes another array for no reason
[06:24:39] <jarrod322> hm how could i get the number of elements then? is that possible
[06:24:52] <kborchers> jarrod322: every time you call that function you are recreating the invites var thus it will always be one and only accessible via that function's scope
[06:25:10] <jarrod322> ah right.. totally missed that hehe thx for pointing out
[06:25:14] <Kambfhase> antihero: it should.
[06:25:16] <jarrod322> hmmz that makes it a bit more complicated then
[06:25:35] <kborchers> $("#basket").children().length will tell you the num of elements in basket
[06:25:44] <kborchers> num of children i should say
[06:25:58] <jarrod322> kborchers: would there be a way around that clientside? or do i have to post the number to server with ajax for example and initiate the count on every new function call?
[06:26:22] <antihero> Kambfhase: Hmm, wasnt working. Did stuff a different way now anyway
[06:26:29] <kborchers> what do you need the length for jarrod322?
[06:26:31] <jarrod322> ah cool i try that thankx kborchers!
[06:26:46] <jarrod322> kborchers: i have basket and add images there, i wanted to have max 5 images to be allowed
[06:26:58] <jarrod322> for now just clientside im building a first version of a app where this is to be included
[06:27:07] <kborchers> yeah, use what i said earlier
[06:27:12] <jarrod322> yeah indeed got it thx!
[06:28:03] <jarrod322> great great love jquery :)
[06:31:06] <jarrod322> and what would be an if not statement in jquery if (!$a > $b ) { does not seem to work

[06:36:35] <jarrod322> hi guys you know maybe how i can post an jquery array to rails ?
[06:36:49] <jarrod322> got some jquery together that builds an array now i need to transfer that array to ruby

[06:40:46] <Kambfhase> by jQuery Array you mean a set of elements?
[06:41:31] <jarrod322> Kambfhase: yes
[06:42:07] <Kambfhase> if the elements are form elements you can use .serialize() otherwise you are fucked.
[06:42:59] <adrianp> lol
[06:44:08] <jarrod322> hehe Kambfhase
[06:44:21] <jarrod322> no its not form values must be not that hard but cannot find a good example
[06:44:50] <Kambfhase> you can grab the .html() and send that :o
[06:48:05] <jarrod322> damn stupid only the other way around think i search for wrong terms
[06:48:18] <jarrod322> so i could post the jquery array to rails with json, just post it as json?
[06:53:27] <Jeroenem> hi guys.. how can i get this to work? http://jsfiddle.net/5pRsY/  on click it shows all content, but it should only show the concent of the item you click on
[06:54:22] <jita> could anybody please tell me what is wrong with this script? http://dpaste.com/629620/. It only create empty <div class="track-item song"></div> on clicking add
[06:55:54] <kborchers> Jeroenem: http://jsfiddle.net/kborchers/5pRsY/2/
[06:56:02] <wpsmith> is there a way to get the value of a hidden field via jquery?
[06:56:15] <sean`> ?val @ wpsmith
[06:56:22] <wpsmith> is there a way to get the value of a hidden input field via jquery?
[06:56:26] <adrianp> jita: var n = $('div.track-item');
[06:56:40] <wpsmith> sean` <input type="hidden" id="action" value="ap-get-terms">
[06:56:50] <adrianp> wpsmith: as per sean` , see val()
[06:57:00] <sean`> adrianp, ?
[06:57:03] <sean`> oh
[06:57:07] <sean`> nvm,
[06:57:38] <wpsmith> so assuming $var = jQuery; then I can use $("#action").val();
[06:58:50] <adrianp> wpsmith: you can query any element in the dom for the value with val() provided it has one
[06:59:14] <adrianp> "hidden" is only hidden from the user
[07:00:06] <Jeroenem> kborchers - thanks.. i was struggling with the this and next() function but didnt manage to get it to work
[07:01:41] <ftwordring> ?delegate
[07:02:16] <wpsmith> adrianp so I wrote this correctly: var action = $("#action").val();
[07:05:35] <ftwordring> I'm raging, my .delegate for click was working a second ago, I changed the class from like heading2 to heading1, updated it in the delegate, and now it's broken...
[07:05:37] <NodeX> wpsmith that will set "action" to "ap-get-terms"
[07:05:42] <Lion31> http://jsfiddle.net/ccdNW/  <--- please help
[07:05:55] <Lion31> I need to get the proper page number for a given ID
[07:05:55] <wpsmith> great
[07:06:26] <NodeX> Lion31 ... ?
[07:06:26] <Lion31> adrianp: sorry for before, had to go out
[07:06:43] <Lion31> NodeX: it is written in the comments what I need
[07:06:45] <t4nkd> hallo jquery -- what's a way to get the boolean for "element does not have class 'foo'"
[07:07:29] <Lion31> .hasClass("foo');
[07:07:40] <t4nkd> oh true, of corse there's a hasClass function :P
[07:07:59] <adrianp> wpsmith: looks ok
[07:08:03] <NodeX> videos.$.versions.video.status
[07:08:03] <Lion31> :D jquery rulez ;)
[07:08:06] <NodeX> oolps
[07:08:12] <NodeX> http://jsfiddle.net/ccdNW/1/
[07:08:14] <NodeX> @ Lion31
[07:09:00] <Lion31> NodeX: what if it has a page number 15? like page_15?
[07:09:12] <NodeX> and what if it does
[07:09:17] <NodeX> do I split on _ ? ... no
[07:09:32] <Lion31> oh, I thout it splits on last char ;)
[07:09:36] <Lion31> great, thanx
[07:09:44] <NodeX> split(" "); is a space lol
[07:10:04] <NodeX> you can probably shorten it but I did it like that for you to see
[07:10:12] <Kambfhase> you want that as a number or as a string?
[07:10:28] <NodeX> if you want it as a number parseInt(yourClass)
[07:10:39] <NodeX> var num=parseInt(yourClass);
[07:10:41] <Kambfhase> always use parseint with a base
[07:10:43] <Lion31> I need a number that is next to page_
[07:10:53] <NodeX> then parse int it ..
[07:10:56] <Lion31> cool
[07:11:09] <Kambfhase> +$('#c_'+id).attr('id').match(/$c_(\d)+^/)[1]
[07:11:17] <NodeX> http://jsfiddle.net/ccdNW/1/
[07:11:21] <adrianp> what if you have more than 9 pages?
[07:11:36] <adrianp> i would split ccc by _ and return the second element
[07:11:47] <NodeX> Kambfhase ... that's matching the ID and it's on the class
[07:11:48] <Lion31> NodeX: var yourClass=ccc[ccc.length-1]; this one collects last class in the className, right?
[07:11:52] <Lion31> it is note safe
[07:11:55] <NodeX> yes
[07:11:55] <Kambfhase> oh, yeah, my fault
[07:12:11] <NodeX> it is not safe ? .. why is that exactly
[07:12:28] <Lion31> NodeX" becouse there could be other classes after page_15
[07:12:32] <NodeX> apart from the fact it assumes more than one class
[07:12:40] <Lion31> it would be safer to loop from the array
[07:12:44] <Lion31> of classes
[07:12:53] <NodeX> go for it
[07:12:56] <Lion31> and check if the string has page_ in it
[07:12:57] <TrueColors> http://www2.beatbullying.org/firewalk/CMFixed/profile.html - click on Uploads, ... you can see there is something missing, now when you click next or previous .. the panels show up. From what I can view source on first load without clicking a prev or next button - there is a default inline-style with a height of 0px.
[07:13:02] <NodeX> waste of time .. I would make my app spit it out
[07:13:05] <TrueColors> This is causing it, only in the css ... codaslider, I cannot find it.
[07:13:11] <NodeX> or hiden an element in the LI
[07:13:15] <TrueColors> not the css, I mean jquery.
[07:13:34] <wpsmith> So if I have 4 select <select name="region" id="region" class="agentpress-taxonomy">...</select> all with the same class but different names/ids, can I use .val() to create an array?
[07:13:58] <NodeX> Lion31 : you mentioned nothing about classes after it so going on what you gave us that is the solution
[07:14:26] <NodeX> wpsmith : yes
[07:14:33] <NodeX> you need to each and push them
[07:15:11] <NodeX> $(".selctor").each(function(index){myArray.push($(this).val());
[07:15:26] <jarrod322> someone can point me to a post json data to rails action please? im trying to find a good one but its all different way around :(
[07:15:38] <ftwordring> What am I missing here? http://jsfiddle.net/mWqd4/

[07:15:48] <jarrod322> ah wrong channel sorry about that
[07:16:19] <mattyh88> hey, apparently there's a problem on my site in IE7. How can I check what's causing this problem? the site's working perfectly for me with IE9, chrome and FF

[07:16:47] <Kambfhase> NodeX: so, what?

[07:21:27] <NodeX> summit about window.addEvent
[07:21:30] <jita> adrianp: still not working
[07:21:39] <NodeX> changed to onDomReady and it was fine :)
[07:22:20] <TrueColors> http://87.102.122.9/projects/clients/Jeanette_Clement/Cyber%20Mentors/profile.html by default, in the tab uploads, <div class="coda-slider" id="coda-slider-1" style="height: 0px; "> is set.
[07:22:28] <TrueColors> the height: 0px is randomly set there and I don't know how or why
[07:22:36] <cambrian-re> Anyone work with SlickGrid before?
[07:22:42] <TrueColors> it's from the jQuery - codaslider but .. still can't see a thing.
[07:22:47] <ftwordring> Nodex: what do you mean I had a js error?
[07:22:51] <TrueColors> It should be set to the first panels height..
[07:23:06] <ftwordring> hmm
[07:23:08] <ftwordring> nvmd
[07:23:20] <ftwordring> that's how it is in my app tho
[07:23:50] <NodeX> Err
[07:24:15] <NodeX> you had the fiddle to "onload" .. I changed it to "onDomReady" and it stopped the error and allowed your script to work
[07:24:31] <Kambfhase> the delegation doesnt work for me though
[07:24:42] <ftwordring> I'm curious where you saw the error though, was it in firebug?
[07:25:00] <NodeX> where else lol
[07:25:00] <Kambfhase> calm down, its a jsfiddle error
[07:25:24] <NodeX> That "just a fiddle" error stopped the script working .. without it the script works
[07:26:10] <TrueColors> Anyone know how to fix my issue?
[07:26:12] <ftwordring> sorry, freaking out because that means it's something in my app im going to have to investigate lol
[07:26:30] <NodeX> yup lol
[07:26:32] <Kambfhase> negative, if you click on test1 "heading clicked" should apper twice
[07:26:43] <NodeX> negative
[07:26:56] <NodeX> nothing works .. unless you are using the fiddle I forked
[07:28:11] <Kambfhase> http://jsfiddle.net/mWqd4/6/
[07:29:10] <deadly_jquery> i made a div as contentedtable, how to submit, the values of the div?
[07:29:57] <ftwordring> lol kam, im not even getting the test2 click on yours
[07:30:44] <ftwordring> derp had to hit run
[07:30:45] <ftwordring> nvmd
[07:31:05] <ericincoldohio> anyone know of a plugin where I can have a select list, the user hits a button and it shows up in a list.  It's basically a dropdown where duplicates can be selected?
[07:31:08] <ftwordring> that would explain why its still not working in my app because im sticking to using just the .delegate
[07:31:18] <NodeX> strange how delegate doesn't work with classes
[07:31:34] <NodeX> change td.class to body and it works fine lol
[07:32:14] <NodeX> or maybe it's td's .. because it doesnt' work on td either
[07:32:33] <NINTHTJ> Try doing it yourself eric
[07:32:34] <NINTHTJ> http://api.jquery.com/change/
[07:33:01] <Kambfhase> works if you add <table> :|
[07:33:04] <NodeX> ftwordring : from reading the docs it seems it's a node level bind
[07:33:23] <NodeX> body, table, p, dov
[07:33:25] <NodeX> div*
[07:33:28] <jbpalacio> how do I know if there are conflict in jquery plugins I used?
[07:33:34] <Kambfhase> no <table> no <td> no delegation :/
[07:33:46] <webroasters> hi everyone. This should be a simple question. I've got this piece of code here: http://pastebin.com/GgkqqJrZ . I was wondering if there was any way to send data to a PHP function instead of a file? Thanks
[07:33:55] <Kambfhase> jbpalacio: things break.
[07:34:19] <ftwordring> Well i'm glad that it was something tricky... i was mad that it seemed so simple lol.
[07:34:26] <jbpalacio> Kambfhase: how can I pinpoint which one is causing it
[07:34:43] <NodeX> http://jsfiddle.net/mWqd4/17/
[07:34:47] <NodeX> there :)
[07:35:04] <Kambfhase> yayy \o/
[07:35:13] <NodeX> I imagine table,body etc are all top level or somehting
[07:35:19] <ericincoldohio> cool, that'll get it done
[07:35:30] <NodeX> looking at source it looks like it's to do with bubbling
[07:35:35] <ericincoldohio> thanks ninthj
[07:35:40] <ftwordring> very nice, i was afraid i was going to have to add divs everywhere lol
[07:35:50] <ftwordring> thx a bunch
[07:35:53] <NodeX> I wouldv'e used live() and saved teh headache lol
[07:35:55] <jbpalacio> Is there a way to identify which plugins are in conflict?
[07:36:00] <NodeX> yw :D
[07:36:02] <ftwordring> what's the diff?
[07:36:05] <Kambfhase> http://jsfiddle.net/mWqd4/18/ works also.
[07:36:05] <kborchers> don't use live!
[07:36:16] <ftwordring> lol @ kborchers
[07:36:39] <NodeX> what's wrong with live() ?
[07:37:02] <ftwordring> kamb that doens't make sense
[07:37:05] <kborchers> all of your events have to bubble up to document
[07:37:08] <ftwordring> my app has the table root
[07:37:12] <ftwordring> it's not like it's missing lol
[07:37:21] <NodeX> I've never known jquery be that picky about dom parents
[07:37:50] <adrianp> webroasters: you can't target a function because you are dealing with client-side and server-side languages
[07:38:01] <adrianp> you have to post to a file, and have your funtion in that file read $_POST
[07:38:28] <ftwordring> I'm not quite sure why http://jsfiddle.net/mWqd4/18/ works but it's set up the exact same way in my app and it doesn't.
[07:38:40] <webroasters> yeah, you're right. It just occurred to me, also, the fact that I was doing this in WP, that's why I askedin the first place. But that's no big deal because I can still query what I need to. SOrry for bothering you
[07:39:42] <renyard> Hi, I'm trying to use $.sub() with a plugin, but custom selectors that are being added are not available through the subbed or original version of jQuery. Anyone know if this is a bug or expected behaviour. Example: http://jsfiddle.net/tnx8N/2/

[07:42:56] <adrianp> ..
[07:53:10] <kelye> hello
[07:54:42] <cambrian-re> I am working on a database application and I am having some trouble with some jQuery AJAX. On document ready, the first function makes a AJAX request and returns a JSON and populates a SlickGrid (it's a spreadsheet plugin), which works. The second is supposed to trigger on form submittion, pass the form data, and returned a filtered JSON and repopulate the SlickGrid. However, it's not working
[07:54:42] <cambrian-re> and I am not sure where it is failing. I am fairly new to jQuery but 8 yeras of programming experience. Here are my AJAX functions: https://gist.github.com/5d000e0cd81ab6df3a65
[07:56:01] <cambrian-re> Anyone availible to help please?
[07:56:08] <kelye> how can i bind a change on display ? something similar to live but on 'load'
[07:57:06] <jomofcw> Is there a way to pause set some animate in queue, then to start the queue ?
[07:57:38] <ajpiano> cambrian-re: i've never used slickgrid but i've referred people to it
[07:57:39] <jomofcw> Or to animate simultaneous many element ?
[07:57:40] <ajpiano> glancing at the APi docs...
[07:57:58] <ajpiano> it seems that just calling new Slick.Grid(opts) in the getJSON callback is not how to update the data
[07:58:20] <ajpiano> cambrian-re: take a look at http://mleibman.github.com/SlickGrid/examples/example6-ajax-loading.html
[07:58:31] <ajpiano> where there's an insance of Slick.Data.RemoteModel, etc.
[07:59:23] <ccmonsters> got a push out the door this AM. ahhh....feels good
[08:01:14] <wpsmith> ok, can anyone tell me if I am on the right track? http://jsfiddle.net/mUvbx/7/
[08:01:33] <jomofcw> What's the best way to move simutaneous three element ?
[08:03:15] <cambrian-re> ajpiano: It might not be the correct way, but it does in fact repopulate the grid. I have already tested it. The issue I am having is the AJAX call to get the filtered data back.
[08:04:02] <ajpiano> your syntax is invalid
[08:04:04] <ajpiano> just pass a function
[08:04:09] <ajpiano> not .... success = function() { }
[08:04:27] <ajpiano> $.getJSON( "url", data, function() { });
[08:05:01] <Elephant> <3
[08:06:17] <cambrian-re> ajpiano: The first function works with that success = function() and that was taken directly form the example files. I will remove it but it works either way.
[08:06:42] <cambrian-re> ajpiano: The issue is the second function ... I'm not sure if I am passing the form data correctly.
[08:07:32] <ajpiano> well you can audit that by checking the request on the server
[08:07:42] <ajpiano> serialize serializes to a query string which you might not want
[08:08:46] <nbari> hi all, any recomended code for compresion jquery scripts under php ?
[08:09:17] <cambrian-re> ajpiano: I can't debug through the ajax call with xdebug ... How can I audit the request on the server?
[08:10:22] <Elephant> nbari: like minifying JS?
[08:10:32] <nbari> right
[08:10:37] <Elephant> im a tad confused by the question.
[08:10:48] <nbari> so i can trim spaces and make the code more compact
[08:10:55] <Elephant> You want to dynamically minify it?
[08:11:02] <nbari> yes
[08:11:06] <nbari> currently using jsmin
[08:11:06] <Elephant> usually you just minify the production version.
[08:11:14] <ajpiano> cambrian-re: you can see the request going through using firebug or charles or chrome dev tools
[08:11:17] <nbari> but would like to know more alternatives
[08:11:23] <nbari> I found this: http://joliclic.free.fr/php/javascript-packer/en/index.php
[08:11:43] <nbari> but I think that encode/pack the code and I do not know if that could cause problems with some browsers
[08:12:00] <Elephant> Are you dealing with 10s of thousands of requests per second?
[08:12:27] <nbari> no but who knows on the feature
[08:12:30] <Elephant> idk, I would stay away from dynamically minifying JS
[08:12:47] <Phrogz> ajpiano: Dunno if you saw my message from last night; it looks like it was clearly a WebKit problem that happens to be triggered by that jQuery code: https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=69464
[08:13:07] <Phrogz> "FIXME: We should have the same O(N^2) avoidance as nextRenderer does however, when I tried adding it, several tests failed."
[08:13:08] <nbari> must of the code i minifyit with google optimizer and uploaded so it can be dispatched statically, but would like to know or found some good tool for doing it on the fly
[08:13:34] <nbari> it is for a cache system, it will only be build once and later dispatches statically
[08:13:38] <ajpiano> Phrogz: nope, i missed it... that's what i suspected
[08:14:22] <Elephant> my experience with minifying JS is limited, my code didn't work very well on maximum minification, I just removed spaces/linebreaks.
[08:15:22] <cambrian-re> ajpiano: Thank you for your help... I see the audit tab in Chrome Inspector ... I'll have to research how to use it. Hopefully this will help me find out what's going on behind the sceene.
[08:15:31] <Elephant> And if this an application running on a shadow origin server, I would hope network/host resources are never an issue.
[08:16:17] <ftwordring> incase anyone was just curious... I found out the reason my delegate wasn't working in my app. The tag td.heading didn't exist to delegate off of which is why I had to do something like $("#content").delegate(). It was nothing wrong with the delegate bubbling.
[08:16:20] <nbari> ok
[08:16:34] <nbari> and wha about packing the javascript ?
[08:16:43] <nbari> is this really helpfull ?
[08:16:57] <nbari> it helps to make the site maybe laod faster but are ther any cons s?
[08:17:23] <blackspotwiggins> nbari, uglifyjs is probably the best solution
[08:17:40] <nbari> blackspotwiggins: thanks i will take a look
[08:17:50] <Kambfhase> it sometimes makes you cod slightly slower
[08:17:56] <blackspotwiggins> doing it dynamically is kinda dumb, just create the minified version at serve it with apache/nginx
[08:18:03] <ngharo> nbari: debugging is can be more difficult on a packed js file but you shouldn't be debugging on a production site, right ;)
[08:18:04] <blackspotwiggins> Kambfhase, wat? not rly
[08:18:20] <nbari> right
[08:18:26] <Elephant> if it's a cdn system, filesize won't be such a limit since tcp window sizing won't have such a dramatic affect.
[08:18:41] <Elephant> aka a 200ms path is unlikely to happen.
[08:18:41] <nbari> yes, i am usinc the cloudfront of amazon
[08:18:47] <Elephant> if the CDN is worth anything.
[08:18:52] <Kambfhase> wasn't there a case with the google crompressor making a a while loop into a for loop?
[08:18:53] <nbari> but i need a script to bulk proccess all the scripts
[08:18:53] <blackspotwiggins> filesize always matters
[08:19:09] <Kambfhase> size always matters
[08:19:09] <quicksilver> blackspotwiggins: but much less in some cases than others.
[08:19:15] <Elephant> ^
[08:19:17] <blackspotwiggins> Kambfhase, that's why i said uglifyjs not google compiler
[08:19:23] <Elephant> read about tcp window sizing, and path latency.
[08:19:29] <Elephant> to see what that is all about./
[08:19:35] <Kambfhase> yeah.
[08:19:48] <blackspotwiggins> tcp window sizing doesnt mean shit if the script parses slowly / transfers slowly
[08:20:00] <Elephant> ?
[08:20:06] <Elephant> you just stated two different problems
[08:20:17] <Elephant> parse, and transfer are two very very different things.
[08:20:20] <blackspotwiggins> speed of parsing is directly related to filesize
[08:20:22] <blackspotwiggins> same with transfer
[08:20:25] <Elephant> ...
[08:20:27] <Elephant> have fun buddy.
[08:21:58] <Rushing> when extending a jquery ui widget like $.widget("ns.whatever", $.ui.dialog, {...}); ...anyone know if there are magic this._super() methods in there?
[08:24:19] <cambrian-re> ajpiano: Great! So the ajax request is returning and repopulating the data. The issue is that I am trying to post the form data to mysql.retieve.php and it is suposed to filter based on the criteria that was sent via post in the AJAX call. However, it is not getting the data and returns the default full dataset.
[08:24:51] <cambrian-re> ajpiano: How would I go about passing the form data in the ajax call?
[08:25:31] <ajpiano> cambrian-re: if i were you i would grab ben alman's serializeObject plugin
[08:25:38] <ajpiano> and serialize the form to an object and pass that
[08:25:44] <ajpiano> so it goes into the post data properly
[08:25:52] <ajpiano> ?g ben alman serializeObject
[08:26:40] <ajpiano> https://github.com/cowboy/jquery-misc/blob/master/jquery.ba-serializeobject.js
[08:26:48] <ajpiano> https://github.com/cowboy/jquery-misc/blob/master/jquery.ba-serializeobject.min.js
[08:27:10] <ajpiano> wait wait wait
[08:27:16] <ajpiano> im a dummy
[08:27:20] <ajpiano> i thought you were posting here...
[08:27:35] <ajpiano> this should be working fine as getJSON, assuming you're properly consuming the query params and they're being applied
[08:28:32] <ajpiano> (as a querystring to the url you're requesting)
[08:30:54] <cambrian-re> On the mysql.retrieve.php side I am doing a $_REQUEST['filter'] ... but it's not capturing it?  Filter is a string in the form on the page that I am doing the ajax call on.
[08:31:56] <ajpiano> is the url being requested properly?
[08:32:05] <ajpiano> ?filter=watever
[08:32:06] <ajpiano> ?
[08:33:23] <cambrian-re> No. Chrome does not show ?filter='***' in the request.
[08:33:57] <sandwiches> I want to mangle the href on my <a> elements before the browser follows the link.  Is this possible?  I've tried this: http://pastie.org/2655980
[08:34:12] <ajpiano> console.log( $("#form1").serialize() ); before you send it
[08:34:16] <ajpiano> and see what the result of calling serialize is
[08:34:22] <sandwiches> Without line 5 the, the mangling works but the link never gets followed by the client./
[08:34:35] <ccmonsters> yo AJ, are you a fan of the revealing module pattern over normal obj literal ?
[08:35:13] <ajpiano> i'm a fan of both when appropriate
[08:35:19] <Eviltwin> sandwiches: Try not doing preventDefault then not triggering the click
[08:35:37] <ccmonsters> what's your deciding factor between the two, typically?
[08:35:37] <ajpiano> sandwiches: triggering a click is not the same as actually clicking the link
[08:35:38] <sandwiches> Eviltwin: I have.  in that case, the mangling doesn't get a chance to happen, the client follows the link immediatley.
[08:35:41] <cambrian-re> Results: filterBy1=A&filter1_option1=ALL&filterBy2=0&filter2_option1=0
[08:35:49] <ajpiano> sandwiches: do window.location = "mangled href';
[08:35:50] <cambrian-re> That is correct.
[08:35:54] <sandwiches> ajpiano: DUH.  Thanks!
[08:36:00] <ccmonsters> :)
[08:36:23] <ajpiano> cambrian-re: so...
[08:36:36] <ajpiano> why would you expect there to be a variable called "filter" in your $_REQUEST scope...
[08:36:51] <ajpiano> given that none of the parameters in that querystring are called "filter" but rather begin with it
[08:37:15] <monstaRtruck> yoyoyo
[08:37:24] <ccmonsters> yo
[08:37:29] <cambrian-re> That was just an example ... I am request their proper names.
[08:38:29] <cambrian-re> ajpiano: I make a request for all four to them.
[08:38:47] <ajpiano> cambrian-re: is $_REQUEST or $_GET have *anything* in it?
[08:46:41] <cambrian-re> ajpiano: Yes, it does ... Huh ...? I guess it is working correctly? Maybe my PHP code, specifically the test is failing. Time to investigate now that I can see that the information is indeed getting there.
[08:46:57] <ajpiano> cambrian-re: whoa
[08:47:13] <ajpiano> yeah, i mean, jquery sending get params in an ajax request is pretty solid at this point
[08:47:13] <ajpiano> :p
[08:47:56] <ccmonsters> yea, i'd say so ha
[08:48:08] <cambrian-re> ajpiano: Thank you for your help for the second day in a row. I'm Eric, btw.
[08:48:17] <ajpiano> np :)
[08:48:20] <ajpiano> nice to meet you, i'm adam
[08:48:27] <ajpiano> i saw on your gist :p
[08:48:28] <ccmonsters> hey ajpiano , you on G+? I see irish posting random stuff all the time.
[08:48:39] <ajpiano> i'm on g+ but IDGAF about it
[08:48:54] <ccmonsters> got ya
[08:48:56] <Elephant> social networks can die in a fire.
[08:48:59] <ccmonsters> haha
[08:49:22] <ccmonsters> I've never been much of a Social network guy, but i've sort of fleshed something out on G+
[08:49:59] <monstaRtruck> hey guys what is the menu on top of the apps called
[08:50:02] <ccmonsters> ah, I already had you circled ajpiano
[08:50:04] <monstaRtruck> file ..... help
[08:50:21] <ccmonsters> someone put a jquery team circle out there, so I had it.
[08:50:50] <ccmonsters> what are you talking about monstaRtruck
[09:04:55] <feathersanddown> Hi, is there a way to do an ajax post submitting an array ??
[09:05:10] <feathersanddown> a custom array
[09:05:24] <feathersanddown> like checkboxes or multiple selected
[09:05:49] <erichynds> wat
[09:05:58] <erichynds> you can name the multiple select box with brackets
[09:06:09] <erichynds> some server-side languages will turn that into an array
[09:07:19] <feathersanddown> yes, but with a javascript array variable ??
[09:08:09] <jarrod322> arghh!
[09:08:19] <jarrod322> have terrible time can anyone help me fix this line             $('#basket').prepend("<img class='basket' src='/assets/logo.png' onclick='invite('del','user_id'>"); ?
[09:08:30] <Elephant> feathersanddown: does $.serialize() do anything for you?
[09:08:33] <jarrod322> i need to call the function with parameters inside the html that i write out with jquery :S
[09:08:36] <Brodingo> jarrod322 yeah remove onclick
[09:08:45] <jarrod322> cannot use " inside " :(
[09:09:01] <jarrod322> onclick.remove ??
[09:09:15] <Brodingo> no, like, take it out of your code
[09:09:27] <jarrod322> i still have to have onclick="" and i can't do that because i have " already
[09:09:46] <jarrod322> i need that onclick guys
[09:09:48] <Brodingo> all aboard the pain train
[09:10:02] <jarrod322> if you click that image it should be removed
[09:10:06] <erichynds> onclick is bad for your health
[09:10:13] <Elephant> toot toot
[09:10:13] <jarrod322> how else would you suggest i make it removable?
[09:10:27] <jarrod322> erichynds: why is onclick bad ? i thought that was the facto standard
[09:10:29] <Brodingo> use event binding
[09:10:30] <erichynds> jarrod322: use jquery's eveny binding
[09:10:31] <Elephant> $('#elemment').click()
[09:10:34] <erichynds> event*
[09:10:36] <Elephant> under document ready
[09:10:40] <feathersanddown> Elephant: not so much, but anyway
[09:10:42] <Brodingo> that way you can have context too
[09:10:45] <feathersanddown> thanks for help =)
[09:10:55] <Elephant> k, good luck!
[09:11:21] <jarrod322> okay like that havent done some serious jquery in ages ;p indeed i understand that one
[09:11:26] <jarrod322> but now how i could make the element removable
[09:11:30] <Krambfhase> $('<img>',{ src:"/assets/logo.png", class: "basket", click: functiton(){ invite('del','userid'); }})
[09:12:12] <Krambfhase> $('<img>',{ src:"/assets/logo.png", class: "basket", click: function(){ invite('del','userid'); }})
[09:14:12] <feathersanddown> converting that string to json and then reconverting again could do the trick
[09:14:14] <Krambfhase> jarrod322: $('<img>',{ src:"/assets/logo.png", class: "basket", click: function(){ invite('del','userid'); $(this).remove() }})
[09:14:46] <jarrod322> Krambfhase: ah very cool thx alot! i try it out
[09:14:50] <jarrod322> im not that of a jquery guru myself ;p
[09:16:21] <jarrod322> now have this: http://pastie.org/2656220
[09:16:30] <jarrod322> wich is draft and not correct yet but that was basically the idea
[09:16:39] <jarrod322> add and remove items from an array and add and remove items from the #basket div
[09:17:17] <Krambfhase> I#ll rewrite that.
[09:17:33] <jarrod322> then woudent it become             $('#basket').prepend('<img>',{ src:"/assets/logo.png", class: "basket", click: function(){ invite('del','user_id'); $(this).remove() }}) ?
[09:18:53] <jarrod322> http://pastie.org/2656220 seems like the "add" and "del" action if statements do not work either
[09:19:36] <jarrod322> and the add does not work, hoped this to be a little more simple :p
[09:19:38] <rgr> whats the opposite of http://api.jquery.com/serializeArray/ ? (taking into account checkbox values). Apply an array to a form?
[09:19:41] <Krambfhase> jarrod322: http://pastie.org/2656236
[09:20:29] <ajpiano> rgr:  there isn't one in jquery
[09:20:32] <rgr> aha $.each(myAssocArry, function(i,val) { $('#'+i).val(val); });
[09:20:39] <muka> rgr http://stackoverflow.com/questions/172524/populate-a-form-with-data-from-an-associative-array-with-jquery
[09:20:56] <jarrod322> Krambfhase: really appreciate your help thanks
[09:20:57] <rgr> muka^ ;)
[09:20:58] <ajpiano> ohh i read that as serialize, not serializeArray
[09:21:04] <jarrod322> if i try to remove an item it however wont delete it
[09:23:31] <Krambfhase> jarrod322: hmm, trouble is, you function has the same name as your array.
[09:23:35] <wpsmith> can jQ pull the id of an input field?
[09:23:45] <jarrod322> Krambfhase: oh thats no problem i can change that
[09:23:58] <wpsmith> rather, can jQ pull the id of an select field?
[09:24:03] <jarrod322> looked up the docs for remove
[09:24:09] <jarrod322> seems i have to give the element an id
[09:24:14] <johnernaut> wpsmith: yes
[09:24:19] <jarrod322> sorry class
[09:24:30] <jarrod322> that image of mine has no class so .remove would not work i guess
[09:24:35] <wpsmith> can jQ pull the id of an select field based on class?
[09:24:41] <wpsmith> johnernaut
[09:24:58] <johnernaut> you mean can it pull the class of the element?
[09:25:21] <jarrod322> now having this http://pastie.org/2656256
[09:25:24] <johnernaut> if so, then yes
[09:27:20] <wpsmith> johnernaut I have the class, now I want to pull out the id of a select value, so given <select name="region" id="region" class="agentpress-taxonomy"> how do I get the id?
[09:27:47] <jarrod322> also i assume there will be more items added to the #basket and then there will me multiple images with class   basket
[09:27:59] <Krambfhase> jarrod322: on line 16 add an s to invite
[09:28:03] <jarrod322> then                     $(this).remove(); would become @(basket).remove (?) and removes all (?)
[09:28:24] <jarrod322> ahj missed that *stupid i overlooked
[09:28:39] <johnernaut> wpsmith: if you know what the id is, why wouldn't you just call the id?
[09:28:40] <jarrod322> okay great ! almost there
[09:28:46] <jarrod322> the alert with delete action is shown
[09:28:51] <jarrod322> but the element is not deleted
[09:29:04] <wpsmith> bcs the ids will be produced dynamically and I won't know
[09:29:07] <Krambfhase> yeah, javascript has no .remove() method ;)
[09:29:11] <wpsmith> but I will know the class johnernaut
[09:29:14] <johnernaut> Oh I see
[09:29:15] <jarrod322> ah that explains alot ;)
[09:29:27] <jarrod322> yeah that was some "Free thinking " filling in the gaps ;) just to get the basics up
[09:29:45] <jarrod322> http://api.jquery.com/remove/ that one?
[09:30:24] <jarrod322> but it maybe like this http://pastie.org/2656256
[09:30:31] <johnernaut> wpsmith: do something like $('.agentpress-taxonomy').attr('id')
[09:30:33] <jarrod322> i made the basket class to the image renamed that to player
[09:30:37] <Krambfhase> That is a jQuery method and it only works on the DOM. but players is a JavaScript Array.
[09:30:47] <jarrod322> but this would remove all elements with class player right
[09:31:03] <wpsmith> johnernaut so is it something like this: $('.agentpress-taxonomy').change(function() { var id = $('.agentpress-taxonomy').attr('id') }
[09:31:05] <jarrod322> Krambfhase: okay did not knew that
[09:31:41] <johnernaut> wpsmith: yes, ID will be set to whatever value is in your id attribute
[09:32:16] <jarrod322> the manuals i found online refer like   $('.removeMe').remove();
[09:32:25] <jarrod322> but that is something we cannot use now? I indeed need to do 2 things
[09:32:32] <jarrod322> remove from the array, and remove from the #basket div
[09:32:43] <wpsmith> johnernaut, now if I have say 4 of those selects all with the same class, does will $('.agentpress-taxonomy').change(function() { var id[] = $('.agentpress-taxonomy').attr('id') } produce an array of ids?
[09:33:25] <johnernaut> wpsmith: I believe so, but I'm not 100% sure.  You should test it out in a simple html page
[09:33:26] <jarrod322> okay as suspected   $('.player').remove(); removes *all* attached image elements with class player from the #basket div
[09:33:31] <Krambfhase> jarrod322: try this: http://pastie.org/2656292
[09:33:37] <jarrod322> argh.. how would i be able to make those unique then very hard this

[09:34:21] <johnernaut> wpsmith: and I think in your change function you should just use $(this) instead of calling the class again
[09:34:54] <jarrod322> Krambfhase: that works! great thanx so much for the help
[09:35:05] <Krambfhase> np.
[09:35:10] <jarrod322> im going to buy jquery book but at this moment also learning ruby on rails
[09:35:22] <jarrod322> i have oneee smalll thing left for it to be perfect
[09:35:29] <jarrod322> only add if user_id is unique
[09:35:37] <jarrod322> else you would be able to add 1 image 2times
[09:35:40] <Krambfhase> you will do your self a favor if you read this, see ?ftj

[09:36:04] <cakehero> Any idea why I get this: http://cl.ly/2a16183Y2e0M1c3a1a0B Is there a plugin creating an Event object or something? I don't get the "[ native code]" part.
[09:36:55] <cakehero> like if I do "function Something() { return true; }" then i actually see the statements in the function when I call Something in console
[09:37:05] <cakehero> not just "[native code]"
[09:39:51] <wpsmith> ajpiano so something like this: http://jsfiddle.net/mUvbx/20/
[09:40:37] <Krambfhase> jarrod322: to add a player you call invites("add", newID ) imirite?
[09:41:20] <jarrod322> new_id I used yes it should be newID in jquery best practice is that what you mean?
[09:41:43] <jarrod322> guess checking the array for a value of user_id and only add if not exist
[09:42:08] <Krambfhase> um, ok. we have a small problem here then, but I'll fix it.
[09:43:39] <jaggz--> how would I make my <div>'s height be a % of the parent element's width?

[09:45:58] <jarrod322> thanks great great Krambfhase you my hero for today ;)
[09:46:40] <Krambfhase> :D
[09:47:17] <Krambfhase> dogarrhea2: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grep ;)
[09:47:39] <dogarrhea2> jquery grep does NOT grep
[09:48:02] <dogarrhea2> it implements .filter
[09:48:29] <Hory> Is it normal for the "ui-widget" class to introduce these unwanted spaces between buttons in button sets? Compare first set to the second from: http://jsbin.com/eweno3/15/
[09:48:59] <Krambfhase> yeah, .filter() but with wrong arguments
[09:49:18] <wpsmith> what does var data = { } mean? is that how arrays are built in jQuery?
[09:50:09] <dogarrhea2> wpsmith, you can also do new Array();
[09:50:17] <Krambfhase> wpsmith: thats an `objject`in JavaScript
[09:50:35] <ajpiano> dogarrhea2: you shouldn't use new Array or new Object etc
[09:50:37] <wpsmith> so array would be var data = [];
[09:50:38] <ajpiano> literals are preferred
[09:50:39] <karega> what is the difference between $this = $(this) and var dhis = jQuery(this)
[09:50:49] <ajpiano> karega: nothing
[09:50:53] <ajpiano> ?$prefix
[09:50:53] <bot-t> It is a common convention to prefix variables that refer to jQuery objects with a $ (Ex. var $this = $(this). The $ has NO SPECIAL MEANING and is simply customary among some developers. Others object to it on the grounds that it is "Hungarian Notation." Feel free to use it or not!
[09:51:09] <dogarrhea2> what's wrong with new Array()?
[09:51:14] <Hory> wpsmith: you're going to give yourself a lot of headaches if you're gonna start using jQuery before learning JS basics
[09:51:28] <wpsmith> Hory there already
[09:52:18] <karega> ajpiano, thx, so the only difference is 9 bytes
[09:52:30] <wpsmith> Hory I know PHP and am learning jQuery
[09:52:31] <Krambfhase> dogarrhea2: its longer, its slower, its irritating, it sucks.
[09:52:35] <wpsmith> painfully I might add

[09:53:22] <jarrod322> again a little small jquery issue ;p i try to post my array with ajax to a location in my app but it gives some errors back
[09:53:30] <dogarrhea2> Krambfhase: the code or runtime or wut?  does the actual thing you are using differ greatly when you declare it one way or another?
[09:53:31] <jarrod322> and even before that, an array looses live outside a function right?
[09:53:42] <jarrod322> i mean its values are not stored in memory when you leave the function?

[10:13:47] <terminal_case> Sorry, I was typing.
[10:13:56] <terminal_case> And thinking.
[10:13:58] <necromancer> :D
[10:14:06] <necromancer> terminal_case: in the /topic it says "Just ask!"
[10:14:10] <necromancer> that's why i was being a jerk :)
[10:14:12] <terminal_case> Lol mmk.
[10:14:33] <terminal_case> My bad then.
[10:14:48] <necromancer> terminal_case: does the PHP script work without using javascript?
[10:15:03] <necromancer> i guess this is a login thing huh
[10:15:11] <terminal_case> necromancer: It should... it properly sends the cookie, I know that.
[10:15:31] <necromancer> now remember that PHP does not work asynchronously
[10:15:42] <terminal_case> Meaning...?
[10:15:57] <necromancer> it will set the cookie in the header but as soon as you start outputting HTML it stops writing the HTTP header and goes to the actual content
[10:16:20] <necromancer> your life might be a bit easier if you set your cookie with JS instead of PHP
[10:16:30] <necromancer> just make the PHP return a JSON response or something
[10:16:36] <necromancer> (which is easy)
[10:16:40] <terminal_case> Right. The cookie is automatically set once the session begins, and it gets sent with the reponse. It does.
[10:16:57] <necromancer> right, but it's not doing path & expires properly
[10:17:06] <terminal_case> Is it not?
[10:17:07] <terminal_case> Ah.
[10:17:14] <necromancer> you said it wasn't, i have no idea
[10:17:20] <necromancer> i don't even know what your code looks like :)
[10:17:30] <terminal_case> Well, the problem seemed to me to be something in the JavaScript...
[10:17:54] <terminal_case> Because when I get the cookie back with the initial JSON response, expires, path, and domain are all set properly.
[10:18:07] <necromancer> oh ok
[10:18:16] <necromancer> so...where does expires/path get unset then?
[10:18:26] <necromancer> when do you observe that happening?
[10:18:27] <terminal_case> It's when I then try to submit a new Ajax request to a different screen and access the same session that I notice they're unset.
[10:18:42] <terminal_case> In Firebug, the jQuery request lists them as blank.
[10:19:00] <terminal_case> er, Ajax request.
[10:19:16] <necromancer> "a different screen"?
[10:19:18] <terminal_case> And by screen, I meant php script./
[10:19:20] <terminal_case> Sorry.
[10:19:22] <necromancer> oh
[10:19:34] <necromancer> so now there's 2 ajax requests
[10:19:43] <terminal_case> Yes. The inital one receives the cookie properly.
[10:19:47] <terminal_case> It's there.
[10:19:57] <terminal_case> But the second one doesn't send it correctly, it seems.
[10:20:06] <terminal_case> The data aforementioned is missing.
[10:20:51] <terminal_case> Hangon, I'll post a snippet...
[10:21:04] <necromancer> cookies are really best for storing little bits of data on the browser to be accessed later by the browser or JS. PHP can do it so you can just set these cookies before JS gets a chance to execute, which is nice
[10:21:54] <necromancer> so what you're doing is making a POST which also sets a cookie. you see this happening in Firebug. then, you make another ajax POST to another script (or the same script?) and the cookie data is lost.
[10:22:03] <necromancer> are you sending the cookie data along with the POST to your new endpoint?
[10:22:16] <necromancer> because you *could* do that, rather than reading from browser cookies
[10:22:21] <necromancer> which are somehwat unreliable imo
[10:22:39] <terminal_case> The POST doesn't set the cookie; I assumed that the cookie was sent, since it appeared to be already set in the browser.
[10:23:12] <terminal_case> I guess that's my question. Does jQuery Ajax POST properly send cookies?
[10:23:50] <context> terminal_case: i doubt thats something jquery can even control.
[10:23:55] <necromancer> POST doesn't ever send cookies
[10:24:01] <necromancer> POST sends what you tell it to send
[10:24:03] <necromancer> and nothing more
[10:24:09] <context> uhh
[10:24:13] <necromancer> terminal_case: don't assume anything
[10:24:15] <necromancer> :)
[10:24:18] <context> then 90% of websites would never work.
[10:24:20] <terminal_case> Not in the header or anything?
[10:24:30] <terminal_case> Because it says in Firebug that it is sending.
[10:24:31] <necromancer> why would it?
[10:24:41] <terminal_case> Just without essential data
[10:24:53] <necromancer> it does send headers but iirc it doesn't send your cookies along with it
[10:25:01] <context> necromancer: cause the cookie controls your session, you'd assume people want there session to be transmited with ALL requests.
[10:25:01] <necromancer> i mean every HTTP request sends headers
[10:25:20] <necromancer> that's true
[10:25:41] <necromancer> oh yeah i look in firebug and it does send cookie information
[10:25:42] <context> so assuming it doesn't get sent is something you should never be assuming.
[10:25:57] <necromancer> his issue is data is being lost between POSTs
[10:26:06] <context> define "lost"
[10:26:14] <necromancer> like the first POST seems to set cookies in the browser but the second one loses that cookies' expires & path are blank
[10:26:22] <necromancer> even though they get set properly and confirmed to transfer to the browser
[10:26:36] <necromancer> terminal_case: btw if you use Firebug get Firecookie, very easy cookie management interface for firebug
[10:27:06] <necromancer> you'll be able to see when your cookie gets rewritten and what it gets rewritten to as it happens
[10:27:34] <terminal_case> necromancer: ahh...
[10:28:01] <terminal_case> I think I may have Firecookie, but didn't realize it could be used to debug cookie changes.
[10:28:19] <necromancer> yeah you can just watch it during your workflow and see when cookies get rewritten
[10:28:43] <terminal_case> That's just it though. I have it open right now and the cookie hasn't changed...
[10:28:47] <context> why are you putting so much stuff in the cookie
[10:28:51] <terminal_case> I'm not.
[10:28:56] <terminal_case> Just a single "id" field.
[10:29:21] <terminal_case> Perhaps the cookie changes briefly before being sent though...
[10:29:57] <monstaRtruck> dang finaly got my global menu back
[10:31:31] <terminal_case> Yeah. The cookie isn't changing.
[10:31:49] <terminal_case> It's just not being sent with all of its data to the script.
[10:35:48] <terminal_case> http://i1197.photobucket.com/albums/aa428/terminal_case/pic.png
[10:36:00] <terminal_case> That's the cookie in my POST request.
[10:37:42] <terminal_case> http://i1197.photobucket.com/albums/aa428/terminal_case/pic2.png
[10:37:49] <terminal_case> That's a picture of it in Firecookie.
[10:38:25] <terminal_case> The id values are different because I took these snips during two different test logins.
[10:38:38] <mattp_> say im injecting html into a div #div, and want to resize a parent div based on the injected htmls redrawn size
[10:38:42] <terminal_case> But they would be the same. Note that the other fields are all missing though.
[10:38:53] <mattp_> how can i wait until the redraw happens for an accurate $('#div').height?
[10:39:21] <terminal_case> $('#div').load()?
[10:39:27] <terminal_case> mattp_;
[10:40:01] <mattp_> terminal_case: touche. thanks
[10:40:08] <terminal_case> no problem.
[10:40:51] <terminal_case> and just add a "complete" event handler to that.
[10:41:56] <terminal_case> Or you could use .ready()
[10:42:12] <wpsmith> can anyone tell me what I've done wrong in splitting my string? http://jsfiddle.net/mUvbx/31/
[10:42:48] <terminal_case> wpsmith: what are you trying to do?
[10:44:16] <wpsmith> terminal_case, taxonomies = a string like region,location,types and I want to add those to the data object so that data = { region: jQuery("region").val() }
[10:44:29] <wpsmith> terminal_case but I won't know the names/ids as they are dynamically created
[10:45:37] <wpsmith> terminal_case,  http://jsfiddle.net/mUvbx/32/
[10:48:54] <gpk> hey guys, i am using the Validator plugin. The developer before me modified the plugin source to always display the error messages after an element with a certain class. Which is good and it applies to all the pages on the site where there is validation. BUT i want to update the validator plugin. I am wondering if there is a way ->without<- changing every validator call on the each page manually to have this same global effect whenever the validator is called.
[10:48:54] <gpk> without modifying the sourcecode
[10:49:15] <wpsmith> terminal_case ideas?
[10:49:50] <terminal_case> wpsmith: Why are you using .get()?
[10:50:13] <wpsmith> gathers into a string (taxonomies) all the ids of the selects
[10:50:17] <terminal_case> wpsmith: with nothing there?
[10:50:30] <wpsmith> terminal_case it works with .map
[10:50:54] <terminal_case> .get() doesn't do that...
[10:51:13] <terminal_case> it's used as a shortcut for a jQuery Ajax GET request
[10:51:25] <wpsmith> terminal_case see http://ajpiano.com/2010/when-to-use-jquerys-map-methods/
[10:51:38] <wpsmith> it works, hence alert(taxonomies)
[10:51:47] <wpsmith> it builds the string correctly
[10:52:04] <terminal_case> Oh, my bad.
[10:52:10] <wpsmith> ajpiano is there a way to use .map and build an array instead of a string?
[10:52:11] <terminal_case> I actually didn't know about that usage for it.
[10:52:21] <ajpiano> wpsmith: just... don't do join
[10:52:39] <wpsmith> ajpiano how about adding it to an object?
[10:53:01] <ajpiano> you can't use map to build an object, you have to use $.each
[10:53:30] <ajpiano> var foo = {};  $(".foo").each(function() {  foo[ this.id ] = "wat"; })
[10:53:31] <ajpiano> etc
[10:53:39] <ajpiano> i have to go take the rest of my laundry in
[10:53:54] <wpsmith> bummer ajpiano!
[10:53:56] <wpsmith> I am so close
[10:54:01] <wpsmith> :)
[10:54:21] <Brodingo> gpk if you console.dir($.validator) you can see what the defaults are
[10:56:04] <gpk> is there a way to effect those defaults globally without modifying the plugin source?
[10:56:36] <Krambfhase> gpk: duckpunching!
[10:56:41] <Brodingo> $.validator.messages.email = "That's no email address you idiot";
[10:58:07] <gpk> very sweet, im gunna put that in my global .js and check it out
[10:58:28] <terminal_case> Does anyone know why browser cookies do not seem to be sent properly by a jquery POST request?
[11:00:02] <ProLoser|Work> is this.prototype redundant in a parent class constructor?
[11:01:01] <terminal_case> They don't seem to be sent right in a GET either...
[11:01:48] <freenodiz> hi
[11:02:05] <freenodiz> i'm new to jquery,and i need a tip
[11:02:59] <adrianp> dont ask to ask, just ask
[11:04:25] <freenodiz> i'm debuging the css from a jquery script wich uses a simple fade in and out to slide html/css content.I'm using chrome dev tools to debug.I was able to pause the jquery,but now i cannot see the css rules related with the part i paused.how can i see the css when debuging the jquery?
[11:06:23] <realpap2> inspect element?
[11:08:10] <freenodiz> realpap2,hi,that's what i'm trying to do,but when i pause the jquery,than click on "inspect element",it doesn't do it...it doesn't highlight the classes as transparent blue squares,as it normally do
[11:08:36] <freenodiz> I'm doing somenthing wrong
[11:08:41] <wpsmith> is there any way to alert objects?
[11:09:01] <freenodiz> realpap2,do you use crome to debug the css of a jquery slide?
[11:09:08] <realpap2> freenodiz: then i dunno, im new too
[11:09:51] <realpap2> i used it to check a jquery that adds some css and it worked
[11:11:01] <kborchers> ?alert @ wpsmith
[11:11:02] <bot-t> wpsmith, Forget alert—use console.log() in Firebug (or your browser’s built in Developer Tools) and welcome to convenience! http://getfirebug.com
[11:11:23] <wpsmith> kborchers using jsfiddle right now
[11:11:29] <wpsmith> I'll switch
[11:11:36] <kborchers> no
[11:11:45] <wpsmith> ?
[11:11:57] <kborchers> keep using jsfiddle, just use your console or firebug to debug

[11:12:49] <wpsmith> ty
[11:16:08] <freenodiz> ohhh...got it...i have to go out from the "sript" page...ughh
[11:17:05] <Rushing> i'm trying to put json in an html attribute, and i'm using php addslashes(), but it balks after the first \". looks like htmlentities() works, but i'm curious if anyone knows why escaping the slashes doesn't?
[11:20:47] <wpsmith> kborchers yea struggling on the debug
[11:21:03] <kborchers> what browser
[11:21:07] <blindMoe> I am looking for a plugin that will let me link items from one list to items in another.  I basically need a way for the user to map fields from one datasource to another and want to do it in the easiest way possible.  The other part of it is that the user should be able to link multiple fields to a single one.   Anyone have any recommedations?
[11:21:09] <wpsmith> chrome
[11:21:14] <blindMoe> recomendations even ;)
[11:21:28] <kborchers> and you know how to use the dev tools?
[11:21:54] <wpsmith> yea for CSS HTML not for JS
[11:22:07] <kborchers> go to the console tab
[11:22:11] <wpsmith> yes
[11:22:21] <kborchers> in your js, use console.log() instead of alert
[11:22:24] <AfroTurf> $(".container").load("my/url #title"); loads the whole document into .container. why isn't it just grabbing <div id="title"></div>?
[11:22:26] <wpsmith> ah
[11:22:41] <wpsmith> will it tell me object info
[11:22:56] <kborchers> ?tias @ wpsmith
[11:22:56] <bot-t> wpsmith, Try It And See
[11:22:57] <kborchers> ;)
[11:23:14] <blindMoe> AfroTurf: is it supposed to just load that div?  Doesn't make sense that it would
[11:23:15] <kborchers> and yes, it will
[11:24:25] <AfroTurf> blindMoe in the docs it specifically says that by specifing the selector after the url will grab all contents of the selected container being loaded
[11:24:39] <blindMoe> interesting
[11:24:40] <blindMoe> never knew that
[11:24:47] <AfroTurf> lol
[11:24:56] <blindMoe> does it give an example of how they do it?
[11:25:29] <blindMoe> oh I see what you missed
[11:25:34] <blindMoe> you need a space before #
[11:25:38] <AfroTurf> yes.. and i've done it before exactly like this.. I was wondering though what would cause .loads() function not to only grab the part that i want
[11:25:43] <AfroTurf> yes i know
[11:26:03] <AfroTurf> "my/url #title"); there's a space
[11:26:07] <blindMoe> maybe it is the font in my irc client but it doesn't look like you have one in what you pasted
[11:26:53] <blindMoe> I would imagine you already checked but did you look through the response to make sure your selector is valid?
[11:27:04] <AfroTurf> ya the selector is there
[11:29:19] <wpsmith> kborchers whoa, much more info...not sure what to do with it all
[11:29:21] <wpsmith> oh dear
[11:29:48] <kborchers> you properly debug with it ;)
[11:33:25] <gpk>     $.validator.defaults.errorPlacement = function (error, element) { element.parent(".data").append(error) }
[11:33:51] <gpk> is only appending an error to the first element found, instead of all required elements
[11:34:19] <gpk> any thoughts? when i take it off it appends the error to all but in the wrong place
[11:34:52] <gpk> i also tried it with $.validator.setDefaults() syntax and same thing happens
[11:39:06] <dreinull> I have a hover method on some elements. Now I add some elements to the dom dynamically but hover doesn't work on them yet. Do I have to update something so it is affected and reacts to hover as well?
[11:40:37] <kborchers> ?delegate @ dreinull
[11:40:38] <bot-t> dreinull, .delegate(selector, eventType, handler): [New in v1.4.2] Attach a handler to the event for all elements which match the current selector, now or in the future, based upon a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[11:42:14] <dreinull> kborchers: seems like this is what I was looking for. Thanks.
[11:43:50] <ccmonsters> so should I start using the widget as a wrapper for some of my code?
[11:43:56] <ccmonsters> kborchers:  you ever use the $.widget?
[11:46:49] <kborchers> ccmonsters: occasionally
[11:46:59] <jbrokc> can I give an array of different parent selectors to a similar child selector? for instance, $([#foo, #bar] .baz)  that is any .baz under #foo and/or #bar
[11:47:06] <jbrokc> or do I have to use #foo .baz, #bar .baz?
[11:47:10] <kborchers> this will help you decide if it's right for what you're doing and how http://ajpiano.com/widgetfactory
[11:47:21] <ccmonsters> I read that. It's what got me thinking
[11:48:40] <ccmonsters> It's nice because it provides so many conveniances
[11:48:50] <ccmonsters> just not sure if I want all that...
[11:48:53] <ccmonsters> or need it
[11:50:42] <mattyh88> i'm looking for a validation method for the autocomplete UI. there are a few hundreds of options but only one of these options may be filled in, no free text allowed. how can i do this please?
[11:50:57] <ccmonsters> what are you trying to validate?
[11:51:04] <ccmonsters> ? demo @ mattyh88
[11:51:05] <bot-t> mattyh88, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[11:52:21] <mattyh88> ccmonsters: i can't show anything, but i'll try to explain better. I have an input field which has an autocompleter attached to it. When a user types 2 characters it starts searching for records in the database. But a user can type whatever they want atm. The validator should check if the text that's filled in, is in fact an option from the database
[11:52:53] <ccmonsters> Well, do you have a ruleset of what wouldn't be an option before hand?
[11:53:17] <mattyh88> ccmonsters: what do you mean with a ruleset?
[11:53:39] <ccmonsters> well, how do you know whether it's valid or not before they start searching?
[11:53:56] <mattyh88> no, no .. i can only check when a user clicks submit
[11:54:31] <ccmonsters> Ok, so when are you trying to inform them that something is indeed, invalid?
[11:54:32] <kborchers> mattyh88: if you look at the combobox example it does some checking to make sure only an option from the list is allowed see ?ui.autocomplete
[11:54:33] <bot-t> mattyh88, The Autocomplete widgets provides suggestions while you type into the field. http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/
[11:54:48] <mattyh88> ccmonsters: after they clicked submit
[11:55:03] <ccmonsters> well, then just look at the docs. It's pretty clear how to do that
[11:55:15] <mattyh88> oh? :o
[11:55:19] <mattyh88> i've missed that then
[11:55:32] <ccmonsters> kborchers gave a link to it
[11:56:41] <mattyh88> i was reading the docs before i asked my question here, but can't find where i could validate this
[11:56:46] <ccmonsters> essentially you want to either do something with the select/blurred events, or a submit handler if you are actually wanting to do it outside the autocomplete api
[11:56:58] <ccmonsters> blurred = change
[11:59:05] <ccmonsters> well kborchers , Im trying to polish up my RMP style. Never really used it , always went more direct Object Literal
[12:01:03] <kborchers> it is a nice way to organize and does give a lot of extra conveniences!
[12:01:14] <ccmonsters> $.widget?
[12:01:24] <kborchers> ya
[12:01:47] <ccmonsters> yea, I just don't know how i feel about using a pattern that isn't more vanilla js
[12:01:57] <gpk> @mattyh88: if($('#autocomplete').valid()) { return true } else {do something else }
[12:02:04] <gpk> i have used that to catch the autocomplete
[12:02:05] <kborchers> sure
[12:02:21] <mattyh88> gpk: how does it know it's valid?
[12:02:42] <kborchers> it's also fun just making everything a "widget" ;P
[12:02:49] <ccmonsters> ahah. yea i guess
[12:02:58] <ccmonsters> I dont totally get the 'widget' per se, but yea
[12:02:59] <wpsmith> anyone know how to dynamically add to an object in jQuery?
[12:03:12] <kborchers> ?add @ wpsmith
[12:03:12] <bot-t> wpsmith, .add(selector): Add elements to the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/add/
[12:03:15] <ccmonsters> yea wpsmith , but whats your use case?
[12:03:16] <gpk> .valid is part of the validator plugin, when you call it it checks if the form input is valid
[12:03:40] <gpk> if the input is marked required it will return false
[12:03:49] <gpk> if its marked requred and is not filled out
[12:04:01] <gpk> you can also use validate.form
[12:04:20] <gpk> if you want a whole form to be validated not just an input
[12:04:45] <mattyh88> gpk: will it be valid when gibberish is filled in that input field?
[12:04:54] <mattyh88> or only when the value of that field is something from the options
[12:05:03] <wpsmith> ccmonsters hard to explain, but I'll try. I have an array (tax = [region,location,types]) I want to now pull the value from the <select> option and place it in an object (e.g., data = { region: france, location: paris, types: null }
[12:05:14] <gpk> whatever is set in the options for that field
[12:05:20] <dogarrhea2> is setTimeout inherently broken ?
[12:05:24] <mattyh88> i'll give it a try
[12:05:32] <ccmonsters> no, i dont think so dogarrhea2
[12:05:36] <wpsmith> ccmonsters http://jsfiddle.net/mUvbx/33/
[12:05:38] <dogarrhea2> i can't seem to play sound at regular intervals across all browsers.. chrome ok. safari ok. ie = random
[12:05:39] <gpk> it basically allows you to run the same validation process as if they had hit submit, but they didnt you triggered it manually
[12:06:04] <wpsmith> ccmonsters the ids and names r dynamically created (thus unknown)
[12:06:10] <ccmonsters> ok.
[12:06:17] <dogarrhea2> i notice a slight deleay between each recursive call to my function using set timeout for 1.5 seconds
[12:06:18] <ccmonsters> then just serializeArray and move on :)
[12:06:55] <ctk> can anyone think of a reason that using live() would work when attaching a click handler, but delegate() would not?
[12:06:57] <wpsmith> ccmonsters but I need to grab the select options values before
[12:07:16] <ccmonsters> ok. use a selector
[12:07:27] <wpsmith> http://jsfiddle.net/mUvbx/34/
[12:09:17] <kborchers> ctk: assuming your using it wrong see ?p
[12:09:17] <bot-t> ctk, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[12:09:59] <dogarrhea2> hrm it appears that settimout is a fundamental limitation with soundmanager2
[12:10:40] <wpsmith> ccmonsters so how do do something like this: jQuery("#"+id).val(); where id is a var with my selector
[12:11:29] <Rushing> i'm using jquery templates and have a condition to check for a variable, {{if error == "404"}} ... but error isn't always there, since it doesn't need to be, and i get a "error is undefined" message
[12:11:36] <Rushing> anyone know the correct way to do this?
[12:13:01] <ccmonsters> just like that
[12:13:16] <kborchers> Rushing: i haven't done much template stuff but have you tried {{if error && error == "404"}}
[12:13:23] <orolo> i'm trying to send a 2 - level deep JSON object to php via ajax. so i'm using JSON.stringify(o) on the js side. but my string is only one level deep.
[12:13:24] <Rushing> yeah :/ tried that
[12:13:39] <dabear> {{if typeof (error) != "undefined" && error == "404"}}
[12:13:45] <Rushing> gonna attach a hasError method to the json object and do it that way
[12:14:02] <dabear> Rushing: typeof should work
[12:14:10] <Rushing> ok cool, i'll try that first
[12:15:43] <orolo> what's convention for sending an object to php via ajax? does the object have to be stringified first or can i decode JSON on the server side w/ php?
[12:16:37] <dabear> orolo: use JSON.stringify and send it, then json_decode() in php
[12:16:50] <dabear> orolo: usually you don't have to use json though
[12:16:52] <Rushing> dabear, thanks. that did it. i get a wierd FOUC before the item rows finish rendering. i see a bunch of [object HTMLInputElement]. do you know what that is?
[12:17:26] <orolo> dabear: heres my case: i have an object that i need to send to php to write to a file. what's a good way to do that?
[12:17:41] <dabear> orolo: you can just send the object as the data part of a jquery ajax call, and it will be serialized down to a querystring
[12:17:50] <orolo> dabear:  ah!
[12:17:55] <orolo> thanks.
[12:18:15] <dabear> ?g fouc

[12:26:36] <ccmonsters> you are listening to KALA?
[12:26:42] <imsky> ccmonsters: arular you noob
[12:26:43] <gpk>     $.validator.defaults.errorPlacement = function (error, element) { element.parent(".data").append(error) }             anyone have any ideas why this is making my validator display validations for only the first invalid input in the array instead of for all of them at once like it does when i comment it out
[12:26:54] <imsky> DA CLASSICS
[12:27:16] <monstaRtruck> just do a selection
[12:27:19] <ccmonsters> lol
[12:27:31] <monstaRtruck> like $('div .myclass')
[12:27:36] <monstaRtruck> on a string instead
[12:27:57] <imsky> gpk, what's the array?
[12:28:05] <monstaRtruck> or do i have to use $(string).find('div .myclas')
[12:28:15] <imsky> monstaRtruck: bro spend some time with the jquery api
[12:28:15] <ccmonsters> BUCKY DONE GUN
[12:28:24] <imsky> jesus christ, GUESSING how it's done is not a good idea
[12:28:30] <imsky> ccmonsters: omg you know a MIA song
[12:28:32] <monstaRtruck> stfu
[12:28:34] <ccmonsters> omg.
[12:28:36] <ccmonsters> lol
[12:28:37] <imsky> ccmonsters: u r on fire 2day
[12:28:43] <imsky> first taze me bro then bucky done gun
[12:28:45] <ccmonsters> naw, it's cold out.
[12:28:45] <gpk> @imsky its just the returned invalid inputs, say it returns 3 invalid elements, it only shows the error message for the first one, instead of showing for all 3
[12:28:49] <imsky> monstaRtruck: no u
[12:28:55] <imsky> ccmonsters: it's 83 today :\
[12:28:57] <ccmonsters> and that pill took care of the burning sensation
[12:29:06] <monstaRtruck> pompous tweaker
[12:29:13] <imsky> monstaRtruck: your name is monstar truck
[12:29:17] <imsky> u mad bro?
[12:29:27] <monstaRtruck> stop tweaking out
[12:29:32] <imsky> gpk: yeah i know, but in your code...which variable is the array
[12:29:32] <ccmonsters> monstaRtruck: basically you are guessing. you are hunting and pecking as to th eanswer. read the api about selectors
[12:29:33] <davidhaymond> I've got a quick question
[12:29:36] <imsky> monstaRtruck: lrn2jquery
[12:29:54] <imsky> davidhaymond: ask and you shall receive
[12:29:57] <ccmonsters> davidhaymond: just ask
[12:29:58] <monstaRtruck> omg thx dicks
[12:30:00] <davidhaymond> Where is the Visual Studio documentation for jQuery 1.6.4 or whatever the latest version is?
[12:30:05] <imsky> monstaRtruck: omg graduate high school first
[12:30:07] <ccmonsters> monstaRtruck: im not being a dick.

[12:30:28] <ccmonsters> damn.
[12:30:40] <imsky> gpk: hmm can you paste your code in a pastebin again, with comments?
[12:30:52] <ccmonsters> use pastie, it's better :0
[12:30:53] <davidhaymond> That URL returned a http 404
[12:30:57] <monstaRtruck> imsky stfu for 1 second
[12:30:59] <ccmonsters> or atleast, prettier :)
[12:31:09] <imsky> davidhaymond: oh yeah, http://api.jquery.com
[12:31:26] <imsky> ccmonsters: i don't really care, there's tons of pastebins out there
[12:31:44] <imsky> shit, use gist!
[12:31:47] <ccmonsters> tru tru, just making idle convo
[12:31:57] <ccmonsters> gist aint bad.
[12:32:06] <imsky> i forget if they have highlighting
[12:32:11] <ccmonsters> no clue.
[12:32:16] <imsky> TIME TO INVESTIGATE
[12:32:25] <ccmonsters> get to sleuthing then
[12:32:27] <imsky> shotgun get down, get down get down get down
[12:32:39] <davidhaymond> That's just the online API docs, I'm looking for jQuery with XML comments, enabling jQuery Intellisense in VS.
[12:32:49] <ccmonsters> JUMPSHOT
[12:32:52] <imsky> davidhaymond: bro go search microsoft.com using bing.com
[12:33:06] <imsky> ccmonsters: they do has highlighting

[12:34:51] <ccmonsters> not bad.
[12:34:55] <ccmonsters> catchy.
[12:35:15] <imsky> before da fame, as the saying goes
[12:35:29] <ccmonsters> did that one guy figure out his option select to obj issue?
[12:35:33] <gpk> imsky:http://pastebin.com/DALx5CLv
[12:35:36] <imsky> ccmonsters: not sure
[12:35:42] <ccmonsters> wpsmith: ?
[12:36:40] <imsky> gpk: sounds like you need $().each
[12:36:42] <imsky> ?each
[12:36:49] <imsky> oh yeah, he's dead
[12:36:56] <imsky> well just search it on the api
[12:37:36] <wpsmith> ccmonsters sorry boss walked in
[12:37:42] <imsky> lol NO IRC
[12:37:45] <gpk> imsky: tried that, with same results, the plugin has to be running it though a for each if when i comment it out it shows on all of them, maybe the variables are not being updated
[12:37:48] <ccmonsters> dont get caught! lol
[12:37:50] <gpk> dude, i bet you thats what it is
[12:37:55] <gpk> because its inside a doc.ready
[12:38:04] <imsky> gpk: hard to say without seeing the whole code
[12:38:08] <imsky> give it a shot mayne
[12:38:19] <gpk> well, no, because if it can acces it once, it should be able to acces it again
[12:38:22] <ccmonsters> yea, need more datas!
[12:38:23] <gpk> ill test it out
[12:38:26] <wpsmith> no IRC hence my web version that I am using with Chrome which I am not supposed to have either
[12:38:34] <ccmonsters> haha.
[12:38:35] <imsky> wpsmith: quit
[12:38:37] <ccmonsters> what sort of job is this?
[12:38:58] <wpsmith> fun job, pays well.
[12:39:02] <wpsmith> "fun" loosely
[12:39:02] <ccmonsters> doing..?
[12:39:04] <chovy> is there a way to listen to a variable and trigger an event when it's value changes?
[12:39:10] <imsky> chovy: no
[12:39:10] <ccmonsters> um. yes
[12:39:12] <ccmonsters> lol
[12:39:20] <wpsmith> well I do training and development dealing mostly with ActionScript or XML
[12:39:22] <imsky> here comes some setTimeout fail
[12:39:23] <Snerf> I have 2 classes, each that has a background image, the main bg and then a piece for the right, but when I use .addClass() for each of the classes, I only see the image on the right, not both. is my css wrong then for the background images?
[12:39:32] <ccmonsters> haha
[12:39:35] <chovy> imsky: heh
[12:39:37] <ccmonsters> setTimeout = pita
[12:39:51] <imsky> Snerf: paste your code in jsfiddle
[12:39:57] <chovy> ccmonsters: i was hoping for some kind of onchange event for a variable.
[12:39:58] <ccmonsters> word
[12:40:00] <Snerf> my css -> http://pastebin.ca/2087762
[12:40:03] <imsky> chovy: doesn't exist
[12:40:09] <ccmonsters> yea, that don't exist
[12:40:16] <imsky> data binding is really tough shit to do right
[12:40:22] <ccmonsters> just have to handle the vaiable as needed.
[12:40:28] <imsky> leaking megahurtz all over this place
[12:40:32] <ccmonsters> lol
[12:40:37] <ccmonsters> mega-hurts
[12:40:38] <imsky> chovy: you need a callback somewhere
[12:40:44] <wpsmith> so ccmonsters, this is supposed to work, right: $("#"+id).val();
[12:40:46] <imsky> event-driven and all
[12:40:55] <ccmonsters> indeedily imsky
[12:40:56] <Snerf> ok, I'll add it to jsfiddle, hang on
[12:41:05] <imsky> Snerf: yeah that's just css
[12:41:07] <chovy> ccmonsters: how should I do it? just poll it and check against previous value?
[12:41:08] <imsky> need the js too
[12:41:18] <ccmonsters> sure, if you keep the last value and the current
[12:41:19] <imsky> chovy: setTimeout fail comin right up!
[12:41:24] <ccmonsters> fiddle or pastie would help
[12:41:33] <chovy> imsky: how would you do it w/o setInterval?
[12:41:42] <imsky> callbacks or pubsub
[12:41:50] <chovy> callbacks?
[12:41:58] <imsky> they're both the same idea, roughly
[12:42:07] <chovy> can you give me an example?
[12:42:08] <imsky> have a function execute whenever the variable changes
[12:42:14] <imsky> chovy: can you search the googles?
[12:42:17] <chovy> i have a setInterval which checks if a user is online.
[12:42:26] <imsky> chovy: why
[12:42:33] <chovy> if they go offline I set var isOnline = false;
[12:42:41] <imsky> so you're already polling..
[12:42:45] <chovy> I need to listen to isOnline to know when it changes and fire an event.
[12:42:49] <ccmonsters> da gooogles
[12:42:56] <imsky> ok if they go offline, just run isOffline()
[12:43:08] <Snerf> hard to do jsfiddle, since it has actual iamges
[12:43:17] <imsky> Snerf: no problem, the code's the only thing needed
[12:43:33] <Snerf> ok
[12:43:39] <Snerf> http://jsfiddle.net/5dTZT/
[12:43:50] <ccmonsters> if(!isOnline){//do some shiz}
[12:44:01] <imsky> ccmonsters: :(
[12:44:15] <ccmonsters> im not sure what he needs really.
[12:44:16] <ccmonsters> demos
[12:45:12] <ccmonsters> why the long face
[12:45:16] <ctk> ok. had time to get a fiddle setup for that live() delegate() question...
[12:45:19] <Snerf> the background images change when I hover of them span's, but I only see the right image, not both
[12:45:27] <ctk> so this example is using delegate: http://jsfiddle.net/charleskline/speRC/
[12:45:30] <imsky> Snerf: this looks like a problem that can be solved with CSS, not jquery
[12:45:44] <ctk> on document ready the show/hide works on the faq titles
[12:45:47] <Snerf> ya, I figured it was css
[12:45:47] <DJSBX> quick little question here. Im using jQueryUI. I make an input button and I want to apply the jQueryUI button style to it. So in the js I added '$("#idofbutton").button()". This seems to make the button look like the jqueryui site told me it would. The problem, is tht the button isnt changing on hover or on click
[12:46:04] <wpsmith> so if data is an object, can I make data.{ver}?
[12:46:10] <wpsmith> data.{var}?
[12:46:13] <ctk> using the filter removes non-relevant questions, but when using delegate it breaks the show/hide click
[12:46:16] <DJSBX> there is also no change on if a button is disabled or not
[12:46:26] <ccmonsters> def csss.
[12:46:32] <imsky> DJSBX: did you ask in #jqueryui yet
[12:46:36] <ccmonsters> now im 4 songs deep on Arular lol
[12:46:40] <ccmonsters> im bouncing all over the place n shiz ha
[12:46:44] <DJSBX> didnt know that was a room <_< I'll check there first
[12:46:45] <imsky> you should be
[12:46:54] <imsky> DJSBX: i might not have written it right, check chan list
[12:46:59] <ccmonsters> why'd you give me the sad face imsky?
[12:47:02] <DJSBX> the jqueryui website suggested this channel
[12:47:08] <imsky> DJSBX: i know, they're wrong
[12:47:11] <imsky> we rarely discuss UI here
[12:47:18] <wpsmith> ccmonsters so if data is an object, can I make data.{var}?
[12:47:19] <ajpiano> imsky:
[12:47:20] <ajpiano> ffs
[12:47:20] <imsky> because i send everyone to #jqueryui
[12:47:23] <kborchers> imsky: there is no #jqueryui, UI help is here
[12:47:24] <ajpiano> imsky: stop doing that
[12:47:26] <ctk> here is cleaned version http://jsfiddle.net/speRC/1/
[12:47:28] <DJSBX> well.. there is one person in #jqueryui
[12:47:34] <imsky> DJSBX: it's you, only you
[12:47:37] <ajpiano> imsky: also, please stop aimlessly blabbering into this channel, it isn't your inner monologue :)
[12:47:57] <imsky> ajpiano: hmm haven't blabbered anything lately
[12:48:02] <ajpiano> ...
[12:48:20] <DJSBX> ah... well.. anyway. Anybody know what might be the problem?
[12:48:30] <atrigent> hey guys
[12:48:30] <ajpiano> please use more discretion in your future communications
[12:48:54] <imsky> internet. srs bzns.
[12:48:56] <atrigent> so if I make an element, add some classes to it, add some other styles, and add a jquery ui thing to it
[12:48:58] <DJSBX> hmm actually I might know why.. gonna try something
[12:49:16] <atrigent> and the proceed to add this element to the page multiple times
[12:49:24] <atrigent> will that do the right thing?
[12:49:26] <imsky> DJSBX: i got it wrong, it's #jquery-ui
[12:49:28] <DJSBX> ah.. figured it out
[12:49:39] <atrigent> like, will the jquery ui stuff be duplicated correctly?
[12:49:58] <atrigent> for each actual element that was added to the page?
[12:49:59] <ajpiano> imsky: the official position is that this is the proper location for jquery ui support, please do not direct people elsewhere
[12:50:04] <kborchers> imsky: wtf?!? UI help is in here
[12:50:10] <imsky> really?
[12:50:14] <ajpiano> atrigent: you'd probably have better luck cloning the elements and then applying the ui stuff after
[12:50:18] <ajpiano> imsky: yes.
[12:50:36] <imsky> well shuck my corn and call me cornhole steve
[12:51:49] <atrigent> ajpiano: well, the jquery clone method has options for clone data and events
[12:51:49] * ctk slaps imsky around a bit with a large trout
[12:51:58] <atrigent> which I'm assuming, append, for example, does
[12:51:59] <imsky> ctk: mIRC is cool bro
[12:52:04] <ctk> :)
[12:52:29] <ajpiano> atrigent: yeah but some kludgy stuff will happen, it won't necessarily tell the ui controls associated with the original element to be associated with the new element
[12:52:35] <ajpiano> atrigent: YMMV, you have to test it out
[12:52:39] <atrigent> hmm ok
[12:52:54] <ctk> anyone wanna take a shot at this live() delegate() issue?
[12:53:01] <imsky> ctk: i'll do it bro
[12:53:03] <chovy> ok
[12:53:05] <ctk> http://jsfiddle.net/speRC/1/
[12:53:11] <imsky> the police is eating my ass in here
[12:53:15] <imsky> gonna blast some NWA
[12:53:48] <chovy> i have a working solution. Question though...$.get() I can  have an error handler and a success handler. Is there a way to fire an event when the request is complete? regardless of error or success?
[12:54:05] <ajpiano> chovy: use $.ajax with the complete callback
[12:54:10] <chovy> ok
[12:54:12] <ajpiano> or do $.get("url").always(function() { })
[12:54:28] <ctk> clicking on the questions shows/hides the answers... that works fine - after filtering the q/a's the click binding is lost
[12:54:30] <chovy> ajpiano: so that will fire after success or error?
[12:54:35] <ajpiano> yes
[12:54:37] <ctk> unless I use live
[12:54:38] <imsky> ctk ok checking it out
[12:54:40] <chovy> thanks
[12:55:11] <ctk> but, the weird thing is i'm not messing wtih the DOM just show/hide when filtering
[12:55:23] <imsky> ctk when you search, the items are expanded. is this by design?
[12:55:25] <ctk> anyhow, delegate should maintain bindings if i understand it
[12:55:29] <ctk> yes
[12:55:32] <ctk> that is correct
[12:55:37] <imsky> ctk so why do you want them to collapse on click?
[12:55:42] <imsky> oh wait never mind just got it
[12:56:01] <ctk> this is a small sampling of the page... there are some 200 q&a's
[12:56:11] <imsky> ctk you have way too much code in here
[12:56:13] <ctk> initially all the answers are hidden
[12:56:19] <webroasters> here's my code: http://pastebin.com/bQgqekwi . When I do this, the PHP file is correct, and it outputs (echos data) when you visit the URL. However, when I try to auto run this piece of code inside of the document ready function, nothing happens
[12:57:21] <ctk> aside from a few small things, it's allr equired to make it work
[12:57:29] <imsky> ctk have a look http://jsfiddle.net/speRC/3/
[12:57:35] <imsky> also it's making my firefox crawl
[12:57:54] <webroasters> I've also tried this: http://pastebin.com/Ly4B45tN
[12:58:26] <ctk> imsky interesting... what was wrong with how i was doing it?
[12:58:37] <ccmonsters> lol
[12:58:39] <imsky> ctk: nothing, you just didn't delegate high enough ;)
[12:58:41] <ctk> dt is the parent of the class i was selecting
[12:58:42] <ccmonsters> wow
[12:58:53] <imsky> jsfiddle is lagging balls too for some reason
[12:59:01] <bingomanatee> Does anyone have an example of adjusting stereo volume independently for audio?
[12:59:40] <ctk> imsky - didn't delegate high enough? what are the rules for that?
[12:59:44] <ctk> i didn't see anything in the docs
[12:59:58] <imsky> ctk: it's not a rule, it's just deciding what element the event bubbles up to
[13:00:13] <webroasters> anyone know? http://pastebin.com/Ly4B45tN
[13:00:14] <imsky> if the element doesn't change/lose bindings during search, it's a good bet
[13:00:38] <ngharo> webroasters: whats the real URL without that php code
[13:00:39] <imsky> webroasters: wtf is that lol ಠ_ಠ
[13:01:00] <ccmonsters> ha
[13:01:24] <ccmonsters> clean that up
[13:01:37] <webroasters> actually, i think I have naother problem. I was able to output the data into an alert(). That means theres something goin on elsewhere. Thanks guys. SOrry for bothering you
[13:02:36] <dabear> no prOblem
[13:03:37] <ctk> imsky thanks for the help holmes
[13:03:42] <imsky> ctk man for sho, for sho
[13:04:01] <Rushing> dabear, found that the [object whatever] stuff is because my object doesn't always contain the vars for ${key} (not sure why it's showing that object string though)
[13:04:44] <Rushing> is there some way around that? seems like there should be a way for a key that isn't there should just output nothing
[13:04:51] <dabear> Rushing: would really help to see a demo
[13:04:51] <webroasters> i fixed it. I'm an idiot. :( Thanks guys
[13:04:54] <Rushing> hm that grammar was wierd, but you get it
[13:06:01] <Rushing> dabear, basically i create an object row with an item id, so the initial json object is just {id:123}, then i do an ajax call to get the full json object for that id
[13:06:37] <dabear> yeah, Im' not notally familiar with .template, so a demo would really help me debug it..
[13:06:40] <tash1> anyone here used prettyPhoto before? If so, how do you space out the thumbnails?
[13:07:26] <Rushing> ok, thanks anyways...there are too many pieces in this for me to recreate as a demo. i can just generate an object with null properties faster
[13:07:47] <Rushing> the json parameters include the columns to get, so i'll use those
[13:07:55] <Rushing> er, ajax params
[13:08:30] <dabear> tash1: space out?
[13:09:04] <dabear> tash1: use margin and paddings?
[13:09:06] <dabear> in css
[13:09:16] <dabear> Marianne: hei! ;)
[13:09:44] <sanduz2> can someone tell me a little bit about the underlying jQuery code. i am wondering if jQuery does compatibility or performance enhancements in the more basic functions, like selecting an element $('#element') or perhaps changign a value $("#element").val('new value'). Or are these more simple functions merely syntactical shortcuts?
[13:09:53] <imsky> sanduz2: download src bro
[13:09:59] <sanduz2> i did
[13:10:09] <sanduz2> but it would take a while to check every single thing
[13:10:14] <tash1> dabear: yeah, I figured in css, just not exactly sure where, sorry
[13:10:19] <sanduz2> just wondering if anyone knew off the top of their head
[13:10:53] <orolo> how do i remove hidden \'s in an object name? they show up when i run stringify().
[13:11:56] <hey_joe> got a question.
[13:11:58] <hey_joe> anyone alive?
[13:12:23] <hey_joe> lets say i have a .ajax() form function that submits to a php page for ?name=blah&action=blah processing.
[13:12:42] <hey_joe> which in turn fires off a bash script with exec(); in php.
[13:13:11] <hey_joe> even though & is appended to the bash script, thus running the process in the background, some of these don't return to the .ajax() handler as fast..
[13:13:26] <imsky> obviously
[13:13:33] <hey_joe> so for instance, one bash script comes back quickly, and then the php tells jquery its over, and successfull, and i display a dialog
[13:13:51] <hey_joe> so i know i can add timeout: and an error handler to the .ajax()
[13:14:12] <hey_joe> would this help any? or is it fruitless? should i just assume the script fired off and not wait for the callbacks?
[13:14:26] * hey_joe babbles incoherently and frequently. just fyi.
[13:15:01] <hey_joe> basically, I have a few game servers running on my linux box, and i have a jquery/php script that starts and stops them...
[13:15:09] <imsky> hey_joe: are you implementing a message queue
[13:15:21] <hey_joe> no
[13:15:23] <hey_joe> main question...
[13:15:48] <hey_joe> i don't get why even though i place & in the bash script after the server execution, why it takes different times to return ?
[13:16:08] <imsky> have you heard of this command called time
[13:16:14] <imsky> $ man time if you get a chance
[13:16:18] <hey_joe> it should just fire the one line bash script, and return, regardless of how long it takes the called items process to start in the background no?
[13:16:23] <wpsmith> ajpiano if data is an object, can I make data.{var}?
[13:16:36] <ajpiano> wpsmith: use bracket notation alone
[13:16:42] <hey_joe> imsky?
[13:16:44] <ajpiano> data[ varname ] = "watever"
[13:16:49] <ajpiano> not data.[varname]
[13:17:02] <imsky> hey_joe: it sounds like you're not sure why some bash scripts run faster than others
[13:17:04] <ccmonsters> he could do data.varname = 'watever' as well?
[13:17:14] <hey_joe> imsky correct..
[13:17:22] <imsky> hey_joe: that's not a javascript or jquery question
[13:17:23] <hey_joe> even though they are one line scripts, with & at the end..
[13:17:29] <hey_joe> good point.
[13:17:42] <imsky> hey_joe: even so, that doesn't mean they'll all run in the same time
[13:17:51] <hey_joe> ah
[13:18:04] <imsky> do you understand that some programs run slower given different inputs?
[13:18:38] <hey_joe> i didn't think a simple one line bash script backgrounding a process would be that much of a time difference
[13:18:48] <hey_joe> i mean i even set the jquery timeout to like 60 seconds
[13:19:06] <imsky> hey_joe: that's a really really faulty assumption
[13:19:16] <imsky> hey_joe: i'd recommend asking your question in ##php, they can help you out far more
[13:19:22] <hey_joe> locally, i can run all five script one after another.
[13:19:43] <hey_joe> within just the few seconds it takes me to type the commands.
[13:20:09] <hey_joe> so it must be something to do with the way php handles exec() system calls.
[13:20:27] <hey_joe> i did notice it worked better just starting/stopping one at a time.
[13:20:41] <hey_joe> thats sucky.
[13:21:01] <hey_joe> any recommendations?
[13:21:08] <imsky> hey_joe: ##php
[13:21:15] <hey_joe> thanks.
[13:21:16] <imsky> this isn't even a clientside question
[13:21:21] <imsky> so they're really your best bet
[13:22:11] <hey_joe> i think subconsiously realized there was a deeper problem, i just joined the where the code started.  although i did build the php backend first ;-)
[13:22:16] <hey_joe> thanks again for listening.
[13:26:21] <hirsty> Hello  guys
[13:26:29] <hirsty> i need help :(
[13:27:00] <erichynds> ask and ye shall receive
[13:27:42] <ccmonsters> namespaces with revealing module pattern?
[13:29:19] <hirsty> currently i have a javascript based accordion that uses jQ too which was googles version (http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.4.2/jquery.min.js), since then i have implemented a CMS which has 1.6.2 and now my animation refuses to work?
[13:32:21] <hirsty> will get my javascript code, hold on :)
[13:34:58] <hirsty> http://jsfiddle.net/6wPUp/
[13:39:59] <monstaRtruck> how do i test for is valid object
[13:40:12] <ccmonsters> wasn't sure if i was doing this right, http://pastie.org/2657542
[13:40:53] <erichynds> ccmonsters: ditch the var in front of var function, and return an object that exposes the functions
[13:41:34] <ccmonsters> yes, in the end.
[13:41:51] <gpk> imsky: turns out changing .parent to .closest fixed it, thanks for your time workin through it with me! :)
[13:41:54] <ccmonsters> i wanted those private, and then have a function which calls them as needed, then expose that.
[13:41:58] <ccmonsters> let me psuedo flesh it out.
[13:42:00] <imsky> gpk you're welcome bud
[13:43:10] <ccmonsters> erichynds: im wondering how i should do namespaces for event handlers though.
[13:43:14] <ccmonsters> what's the best route in the RMP
[13:43:38] <erichynds> there's no prescribed method, it's whichever makes the most sense
[13:47:28] <ccmonsters> well, im not sure exactly how to do it in this case.
[13:47:45] <ccmonsters> little confused i guess.
[13:48:19] <xterm> hi
[13:48:26] <ccmonsters> hi
[13:48:33] <xterm> where u from ?
[13:48:46] <DThought> from my home
[13:49:02] <xterm> ok
[13:49:08] <jastor> why werent you born at a hospital?
[13:49:17] <jastor> ;)
[13:49:20] <xterm> sure
[13:49:37] <xterm> well well
[13:49:49] <ccmonsters> soOoo..
[13:53:15] <ccmonsters> anyone able to help me along with the RMP?
[13:54:05] <wpsmith> ajpiano so no dot? can I make data{var}?
[13:54:15] <ccmonsters> square brackets
[13:54:21] <wpsmith> if data is an object, can I make data{var}?
[13:54:23] <ccmonsters> data[myvarName]
[13:54:24] <ajpiano> wpsmith: i explained the whole thing
[13:54:34] <ccmonsters> he posted this a bit ago, I believe
[13:54:38] <ajpiano> data[ var ] = "watever"
[13:54:46] <wpsmith> sorry!
[13:54:57] <wpsmith> and that's when data is an object correct
[13:55:04] <wpsmith> testing
[13:55:10] <ccmonsters> yea. test first, you'll see the light
[13:55:11] <ajpiano> yes
[13:55:37] <wpsmith> oh HECK YEA!
[14:00:13] <ccmonsters> hey ajpiano , are these two somewhat equivelant? I am just trying to get a handle ... http://pastie.org/2657660
[14:01:07] <ajpiano> yes - they'll both break in IE because of trailing comma in object literal
[14:01:09] <ajpiano> bwahahaha
[14:01:27] <ccmonsters> ah, damn. I hate that damn thing
[14:01:32] <ajpiano> but yes, i suppose they are similar in terms of functionality
[14:01:58] <ccmonsters> i didnt know if that was a proper way to do that
[14:02:08] <ccmonsters> and getting namespaces right
[14:02:28] <ccmonsters> any suggested changes in the approach? Again, just trying to get a feel.
[14:03:11] <ccmonsters> It's your fault btw ajpiano  lol, I started messing around with patterns today after seeing your $.widget slides again..
[14:03:53] <ajpiano> my bad
[14:03:56] <ccmonsters> and specifically, is the way I am doing the var self = this correct? wasn't sure about that either haha
[14:04:08] <ccmonsters> not a bad thing I suppose. I was doing straight object literal style previously
[14:04:38] <ajpiano> ccmonsters: i'm not sure you need it
[14:04:45] <ajpiano> well i mean... doing self=this
[14:04:46] <ajpiano> is really bad
[14:04:49] <ajpiano> cause you just leaked a global
[14:04:51] <jeffsmykil> $("#mapView").val(viewCookieValue); should change the value of a drop down right
[14:05:00] <ajpiano> var self = this would be ok but is probably un ncessary
[14:05:06] <ccmonsters> var self = this, my bad
[14:05:11] <ajpiano> ccmonsters: inside of the module, (line 10, 11) you can call the local private functions
[14:05:37] <ccmonsters> oh, so just drop the self.
[14:05:47] <elpancho> goddamn trailing commas
[14:06:18] <ccmonsters> use to qualifying the whole thing. and yea that trailing , on line 7. urgh.
[14:06:34] <ccmonsters> I had IE throw up on some code a few months back from the infamous 'trailing comma'
[14:12:06] <jeffsmykil> i cant get these selects to take the value of my cookie with $("input#mapView").val('viewCookieValue');
[14:12:17] <jeffsmykil> and would rather not have to think about this all weekend
[14:13:45] <ccmonsters> uh, cookies ... nom  nom sounds good
[14:13:49] <ccmonsters> ? cookies
[14:13:50] <bot-t> ccmonsters, Cookie | jQuery Plugins - Plugins - jQuery - A simple, lightweight utility plugin for reading, writing and deleting cookies. http://plugins.jquery.com/project/Cookie
[14:14:01] <jeffsmykil> i can do that on my own
[14:14:05] <jeffsmykil> thats not the issue
[14:14:09] <jeffsmykil> the issue is setting the select
[14:15:25] <jeffsmykil> aha
[14:16:08] <jeffsmykil> need to trigger the change
[14:17:10] <jeffsmykil> screw this im going home!
[14:20:27] <chriszf> So I can't seem to delegate click events. I can delegate a hover just fine, but delegated clicks don't trigger. Any thoughts on debugging?
[14:23:31] <chriszf> Whoops, sorry, just a bad bind.
[14:25:12] <wpsmith> ty ajpiano and ccmonsters for helping me out
[14:25:32] <ccmonsters> np.
[14:26:16] <ccmonsters> you want to change the selects selected option?
[14:26:32] <ccmonsters> ah, he left.
[14:31:03] <thansen> is there a quick and dirty to make load synchronous and not wipe out my global ajaxSetup?
[14:31:12] <thansen> 'load' that is
[14:34:59] <karega|aniasis> why doesn't the jq ui toggleClass have the switch parameter?
[14:42:37] <orolo> term, in the following is a variable representing a string: languageDictionariesObject[lang] = {term : translatedTerm};
[14:42:50] <orolo> i keep getting the word term and not the string of term. how do i set that?
[14:43:21] <ajpiano> you have to use bracket notation
[14:43:34] <orolo> ajpiano: hmm. term[0]?
[14:43:54] <ajpiano> no
[14:44:09] <ajpiano> you know how you are literally using foo[ bar ] in the left hand side of the expression to set a dynamic key name?
[14:44:18] <ajpiano> you have to also do that... when you want a dyanmic key name later
[14:44:32] <aghouseh> can you do a 'find' equivalent upward toward parent?
[14:44:45] <aghouseh> like find the parent LI when you do not know how nested you are?
[14:44:50] <orolo> @aghouseh .closest()?
[14:45:00] <ajpiano> languageDictionariesObject[lang] = {};  languageDictionariesObject[lang][term] = translatedTerm;
[14:45:08] <aghouseh> alright ill give that a shot thanks. :)
[14:45:16] <orolo> ajpiano: ok. thanks.
[14:46:13] <aghouseh> orolo: worked perfect, thank you :)
[14:48:00] <k1t> hi folks! Does anyone see why it is when I type the number "3" in this field, it clears it until i start typing it again (but is fine from there)? http://jsfiddle.net/HWyVZ/28/
[14:48:15] <k1t> ive been battling with it for a bit now, seems too simple lol :(
[14:48:21] <k1t> soo**
[14:50:24] <k1t> ill paypal $20 to someone that provides the solution
[14:50:53] <k1t> or $30, why not
[14:53:45] <orolo> i'm in a deeper hole now: 			$.extend(languageDictionariesObject[lang], {term : translatedTerm});
[14:54:03] <rroelofs> k1t: your mask function is clearing the field when the mask changes.
[14:54:12] <orolo> i need n amount of the [lang] children.
[14:57:02] <Spadeski> Sup people
[14:57:20] <Elephant> sup!
[14:57:27] <Elephant> code some internets
[14:57:43] <Elephant> trying to stay away from this black hole of time.
[14:58:33] <Spadeski> lol
[14:58:36] <Spadeski> You and me both
[14:59:59] <gpk> have a great weekend folks
[15:00:16] <imsky> you too gpk
[15:00:27] <Elephant> he left the building :(
[15:00:34] <imsky> can't see joins/leaves
[15:00:34] <johanhar> If I bind the "enter" key to a form, will it count for its children like input fields? Thanks
[15:00:36] <imsky> 'sall good
[15:00:48] <Elephant> GRRR that is harder to do in weechat than irc
[15:00:50] <Elephant> err irssi
[15:00:55] <Elephant> I need to ignore joins/parts
[15:00:58] <Elephant> for this channel at least.
[15:01:00] <imsky> use miranda
[15:01:06] <imsky> ctrl+f hides all the garbage
[15:01:13] <Spadeski> hmmm
[15:01:22] <Spadeski> Lets say I have 10 images all draggable
[15:01:31] <Spadeski> and want to make a rating system by there order
[15:01:39] <Elephant> ten images of cats I hope.
[15:02:04] <Spadeski> and when one is dropped on a certain html img tag i want it to change the pic via mys ql as well
[15:02:11] <Spadeski> and yes I prefer dogs though
[15:05:01] <Elephant> I kinda do that with the jquery ui
[15:05:25] <Elephant> I just save the order to mysql every time a change is made.
[15:06:06] <slavka`> hey any of you guys heard of a javascript vsdoc or docml generator...  ?
[15:08:17] <thinkclay> is there a way to trigger mousemove on an element like you can with .click() ??
[15:09:36] <Elephant> like you want to move the curser?
[15:10:03] <Elephant> oh silly me
[15:10:38] <Elephant> what about $.trigger('mousemove');?
[15:10:48] <thinkclay> lemme try that
[15:12:05] <thinkclay> nope, didnt help
[15:14:16] <thinkclay> its weird because an actual mousemove event solve my problem, but not an auto - triggered event
[15:17:07] <thinkclay> here's the full issue if someone thinks they can help me out: http://jq-map.chosenclients.com/ the map has a method to check coordinate boundries onmousemove, but when I zoom the boundries get ignored
[15:17:53] <thinkclay> you can see the issue if you zoom in all the way, then drag the map all the way up (so that you're looking at the bottom boundary) and then zoom out, and it shows white space
[15:18:53] <thinkclay> this gets fixed as soon as content.mousemove fires, which is why I was trying to autofire that event, but it's doesnt seem to work with auto vs manual
[15:25:35] <thinkclay> nvm, I solved it
[15:26:42] <killtheliterate> would someone assist me with extracting something from an object, and then populating an input value with it? Sample on jsfiddle ---> http://jsfiddle.net/nbTuM/
[15:27:34] <bingomanatee> Does anyone know how to change stereo channel volume of mp3s in the client independently?
[15:30:15] <killtheliterate> sorry, never used jsfiddle before. revised the code ---> http://jsfiddle.net/killtheliterate/xrgcZ/
[15:30:40] <imsky> kill...the literate?
[15:31:08] <killtheliterate> jeah
[15:31:12] <killtheliterate> just for fun. i like books
[15:32:24] <killtheliterate> I'm having trouble using .val() to get stuff out of the <a>
[15:32:33] <imsky> lmao
[15:33:03] <Dave_Stein> kiltheliterate if for some reason you're putting a value attribute on a random tag you need to use .attr
[15:33:40] <killtheliterate> the a has an id set for it. what i would like to do is to pass that id as a value for a form field
[15:33:54] <Mahoek> http://jsfiddle.net/xrgcZ/4/
[15:34:00] <imsky> the irony, the irony
[15:34:34] <killtheliterate> ?
[15:34:58] <killtheliterate> thanks, @mahoek… that first link i posted was not correct, and I hadn't meant to post it
[15:35:24] <Dave_Stein> imsky: know anyone that would be interested? http://t.co/mlf5sG2j
[15:35:39] <Mahoek> Ok
[15:35:42] <imsky> oh i read it earlier today Dave_Stein
[15:36:02] <Dave_Stein> the internet moves fast
[15:36:11] <imsky> let's see, i got an SO account, know git, have done front-end for the past 4 years
[15:36:16] <imsky> yeah i'm the perfect candidate bro :D
[15:36:29] <Dave_Stein> imsky: well i did say come to nyc but you hate it for some reason ha
[15:36:42] <imsky> i don't hate it, i'm just not interested in relocating
[15:36:45] <Dave_Stein> and perfect was SVN wasn't it? not that it's hard to learn one over the other
[15:36:48] <imsky> 99% of my work is online
[15:36:55] <Dave_Stein> yup
[15:37:07] <imsky> git is the future mayne
[15:37:12] <Dave_Stein> that's what i hear
[15:37:17] <imsky> although tbh, fossil is the easier vcs
[15:37:22] <imsky> and much moar awesome
[15:37:31] <Dave_Stein> in other news i have a first draft of a blog post / series of posts for making sweet jquery mvc love without having to use all of backbone/underscore
[15:37:36] <imsky> why do you want someone's butt in a seat anyway, Dave_Stein
[15:37:49] <imsky> 37signals does fine without
[15:37:51] <Dave_Stein> imsky: company culture, we're all here, look over shoulders, etc
[15:38:03] <imsky> yeah, my vision is that netcos are going to dominate
[15:38:25] <Dave_Stein> imsky: 37signals kills it but they don't have as high a design standard as a front end dev and designer duking it out in person in front of the CEO ha
[15:38:25] <imsky> your schedule is 9-5, right? :D
[15:38:44] <Dave_Stein> imsky: yeah that's why i'm here at 640 on friday although im done. just being lazy about getting up, walking a block, and going to the gym
[15:38:47] <imsky> Dave_Stein: yeah that's true, behance is the high end of design
[15:39:00] <imsky> Dave_Stein: haha you know what though
[15:39:10] <imsky> i'm actually building something to help people like you find candidates
[15:39:21] <imsky> and not with a blind shot in the dark rfp or job post
[15:39:24] <ProLoser|Work> what's wrong with this syntax??? http://jsfiddle.net/LLb3s/4/
[15:39:24] <Dave_Stein> imsky: dice 2.0? ha
[15:39:25] <imsky> qualified shiz baby :D
[15:39:34] <imsky> Dave_Stein: something way better than dice, linkedin, etc
[15:39:51] <Dave_Stein> imsky: well when you have a prototype up let me know so i can give early feedback and such
[15:40:08] <imsky> Dave_Stein: i will, your talent pool is actually exactly my target market
[15:40:30] <Dave_Stein> imsky: another plus of working 5 feet from chief designer 4 years - i have a real good eye for design and ui these days :)
[15:40:42] <Dave_Stein> imsky: so i should be able to help a bit with that too, if it were needed
[15:40:55] <imsky> no doubt no doubt
[15:41:11] <imsky> Dave_Stein: have you received any interest yet
[15:41:43] <Dave_Stein> imsky: not really yet - scott just RTed me like 15 mins ago
[15:41:54] <Dave_Stein> imsky: it's tricky since ya know we have a massive following but they aren't mostly programmers
[15:41:57] <imsky> Dave_Stein: bro that's the problem i'm trying to solve ;)
[15:42:39] <Dave_Stein> imsky: well outside of the public chat i'm curious to know what you're up to/how. i promise you i have no time/desire/need to steal/share your idea outside of talking to you
[15:42:41] <imsky> Dave_Stein: if you need some freelance work done, though, don't hesitate to ping me
[15:42:54] <Dave_Stein> imsky: we only get freelancers for mobile as of now
[15:43:12] <imsky> Dave_Stein: yeah i'd like to talk about it, but first i'd like to do it ;)
[15:43:13] <Dave_Stein> imsky: although i really wanna push for doing phonegap kinda things and whateer the hell the other frameworks are to use JS to do native behavior on droid/iphone etc
[15:43:22] <imsky> yeap, just did a phonegap project too
[15:43:27] <imsky> not fun for android, not sure how it is for ios
[15:44:07] <imsky> Dave_Stein: oh yeah and i bet the whole office is Mac, right? ;)
[15:44:10] <Dave_Stein> imsky: you might wanna talk more before doing to make sure you don't go down a weird path and then go "fuck"
[15:44:21] <Dave_Stein> imsky everyone except a few devs including myself
[15:44:24] <chovy> anyone know why chrome does not handle a .get("ping.php") request? All it does is return a 204 not modified.
[15:44:36] <chovy> it works fine in FF.
[15:44:38] <imsky> Dave_Stein: never been a problem for me, i don't have my head in the clouds
[15:44:41] <Dave_Stein> imsky: i really think windows 7 is way better interface than mac. mac always drives me nuts with having the app minimized but the toolbar at the top
[15:44:56] <imsky> Dave_Stein: and re macs, yeah lol, macs just aren't for me, something doesn't click
[15:45:00] <Dave_Stein> chovy: possible chrome is being more strict about headers
[15:45:05] <imsky> Dave_Stein: have you seen win8? bro, the future, THE FUTURE \:D/
[15:45:10] <Dave_Stein> chovy: i've had that same issue in the past for JS files, not PHP though
[15:45:17] <chovy> Dave_Stein: safari does the same thing as chrome.
[15:45:28] <Dave_Stein> imsky: you mean when apps for the most popular OS on the planet can be made in HTML5/JS? win for us
[15:45:31] <chovy> Dave_Stein: any idea what the header mixup could be?
[15:45:43] <Dave_Stein> chovy: they are both based on webkit so frequently they behave the same
[15:45:45] <imsky> Dave_Stein: that, too, but also winapp store, ie10, and all kinds of other shiz
[15:45:51] <chovy> chovy.dyndns.org/offline/ping.php
[15:45:53] <Dave_Stein> chovy: last modified headers missing? check your net tab
[15:46:19] <Dave_Stein> imsky: that is cool but i'm happy after that JS will be one of the top languages to know after years of it being scoffed at ha
[15:46:33] <imsky> Dave_Stein: it's always been something for MS, though, if you look in the past
[15:46:37] <imsky> winhost has always had it
[15:46:44] <xterm> cool
[15:46:45] <imsky> it's only after google that it's become mainstream, really
[15:47:15] <Dave_Stein> chovy: do you have a parse error? i get no markup and nothing in my net panel somehow
[15:47:29] <Dave_Stein> imsky didnt know about winhost stuff
[15:47:39] <imsky> Dave_Stein: you can program js in windows since...win98 i believe
[15:47:52] <imsky> yeah, everything old is new again
[15:48:20] <Dave_Stein> chovy: like NOTHING is sending back
[15:49:14] <killtheliterate> how do i add a var to the end of a string, ala php?
[15:49:25] <Dave_Stein> 0.o
[15:49:27] <imsky> killtheliterate: you're killing me man
[15:49:33] <killtheliterate> sorry brother bear
[15:49:33] <xterm> .
[15:49:35] <Dave_Stein> killtheliterate: $x = 'abc' . $var;
[15:49:52] <imsky> i think he wants var x = "abc" + var
[15:49:55] <killtheliterate> I really only mess with php, and I'm new at that. I know how to concatonate in php
[15:50:01] <killtheliterate> hows abouts in jquery?
[15:50:07] <Dave_Stein> ooo
[15:50:09] <imsky> the deep deep irony of "killtheliterate" being unable to read documentation is just killing me
[15:50:10] <imsky> \:D/
[15:50:10] <Dave_Stein> imsky: got you right
[15:50:23] <killtheliterate> jyup
[15:50:30] <killtheliterate> man, friendly place, this

[15:50:34] <imsky> successful troll is successful
[15:50:43] <Dave_Stein> killtheliterate it's friendly when imsky isn't here i swear
[15:50:47] <killtheliterate> that a real channel?
[15:50:47] <Dave_Stein> but on that note
[15:50:51] <killtheliterate> 'cause i'll go there
[15:50:52] <Dave_Stein> no i dont think so heh
[15:50:53] <imsky> it's friendly when i'm here too, wtf lol
[15:51:06] <imsky> i just cut through the "it's ok you're a winner too" mentality
[15:51:12] <killtheliterate> haha
[15:51:17] <Dave_Stein> you just gotta read some basic tutorials before coming into a jquery room
[15:51:24] <Dave_Stein> people don't like being asked questions that can be easily found on google
[15:51:26] <Dave_Stein> since we're not robots
[15:51:33] <Dave_Stein> but on that note... im otuta here. finally gonna get my ass to gym
[15:51:36] <killtheliterate> of course not
[15:51:36] <Dave_Stein> *outta
[15:51:39] <Dave_Stein> see ya later
[15:51:42] <imsky> Dave_Stein: later son

[15:56:19] <ProLoser|Work> i can't figure out the syntax error

[16:30:12] <mg983> Evening all
[16:35:35] <mg983> I'm having some sort of weird issue with the jQuery Cycle Plugin on this page: http://www.yearbooksplus.net/new-dorp-13883-1996/# if you load the page and quickly click (multiple times) on the left arrow the images get squished in the slider - and then if you try to navigate they remain squished in the slide transitions... can anyone help me figure out why/how to have the pages slide properly?
[16:41:34] <aeiou> how do i select any form element that has a select inside?
[16:41:53] <aeiou> $('form select') gives me the select inside a form
[16:43:00] <Lochlan> $('form select').parent()
[16:43:11] <Lochlan> http://api.jquery.com/parent/
[16:43:26] <aeiou> there isnt a selector for it then?
[16:43:39] <aeiou> ( i knew i could traverse the nodes aftewards already)
[16:44:13] <Lochlan> ah
[16:44:24] <Lochlan> don't think so
[16:44:56] <aeiou> i want to bind submit for some form elements, (only the ones with a select inside)
[16:45:02] <aeiou> seems weird there isnt a selector for that!
[16:45:17] <mg983> do an each through every select node
[16:45:21] <aeiou> $('form select').parents('form')
[16:45:23] <mg983> and get its parent that is a form
[16:45:24] <mg983> yeah
[16:45:25] <aeiou> ^ would work
[16:45:34] <mg983> that's exactly what i said :P
[16:45:42] <aeiou> feels a bit inelegant though!
[16:45:57] <aeiou> $('form<select')....
[16:46:09] <mg983> haha! i was going to say that oo!
[16:46:16] <aeiou> it doesnt work ;)
[16:46:20] <aeiou> its unrecognised
[16:47:48] <Aquaguy> Hey, I'm trying to check if a value is null but it doesn't seem to be working, anyone knows why?
[16:47:49] <Aquaguy> http://jsfiddle.net/aEmAM/5/
[16:49:11] <aeiou> null evaluates to false in boolean operations. Always use === when comparing to null.
[16:50:25] <solidus-river> how do i select a div by a data attribute?
[16:50:33] <ProLoser|Work> god i hate js so much right now
[16:51:18] <Eviltwin> Aquaguy: Try typeof null
[16:51:29] <kadiks> hi, does anyone know a plugin that highlight elements like firebug of webinspector does ?
[16:51:47] <Eviltwin> Aquaguy: Then you'll see why
[16:52:58] <dabear> solidus-river: div[data-foo="bar"]
[16:53:19] <solidus-river> dabear: is it important to have the data- prefix for them or can i just use foo="bar"
[16:53:29] <Eviltwin> Yes, it's important
[16:53:38] <solidus-river> what does the data- keyword do?
[16:53:50] <Eviltwin> It's the prefix for all .data
[16:54:06] <Eviltwin> Namespace
[16:54:48] <dabear> note that all data-foo type attributes in the tag is imported into the .data() of the element
[16:54:49] <Eviltwin> Aquaguy: http://jsfiddle.net/aEmAM/6/
[16:55:09] <Eviltwin> dabear: Is it imported or checked with each call to .data?
[16:55:18] <dabear> but when you add a new data-attribute nothing is changed in .data
[16:55:28] <dabear> there is in other words an initial import
[16:55:33] <Eviltwin> Bummer
[16:55:33] <dabear> but no sync
[16:56:27] <dabear> Eviltwin: no. checked etc is not a data attribute, and is not imported into .data
[16:56:40] <dabear> Eviltwin: what are you trying to do?
[16:56:53] <Eviltwin> I'm not trying to do anything
[16:57:12] <dabear> then why is this a concern? why do you want checked to be in .data?
[16:57:40] <dabear> oh
[16:57:40] <Eviltwin> I didn't want checked to be in .data, I wanted .data to check the element's data-* attributes
[16:57:47] <dabear> I misunderstood your question
[16:58:14] <ProLoser|Work> how do i do class inheritence/extending?
[16:58:32] <Eviltwin> Create a new instance of the class you want to extend and make it the prototype of the new class
[16:58:46] <Aquaguy> Eviltwin, thank you!!!!
[16:58:52] <dabear> ProLoser|Work: no classes in javascript. you might want to see ?extend
[16:58:52] <bot-t> ProLoser|Work, jQuery.extend(target, [object1], [objectN]): Merge the contents of two or more objects together into the first object. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.extend/
[16:59:19] <Eviltwin> Not strictly classes
[16:59:23] <Eviltwin> But you can do inheritence
[16:59:39] <Lochlan> Aquaguy: did you get it? think you need element.val
[16:59:53] <solidus-river> can i do multiple selectors in a query scope or do i need to do two queries
[17:00:02] <Eviltwin> $("a, b") ?
[17:00:10] <solidus-river> ^
[17:00:12] <solidus-river> :)
[17:00:21] <Eviltwin> Just like CSS, dude :P
[17:01:35] <solidus-river> is live or hover preferred?
[17:01:35] <ProLoser|Work> Eviltwin: i had problems with it
[17:01:54] <ProLoser|Work> Eviltwin: http://jsfiddle.net/LLb3s/8/
[17:01:55] <dabear> solidus-river: do you prefer rocks or bread?
[17:01:56] <ProLoser|Work> dabear: http://jsfiddle.net/LLb3s/8/
[17:01:59] <ProLoser|Work> i can't get it to work
[17:02:40] <solidus-river> dabear: haha, i should have checked the docs on that before i asked, definitely rocks
[17:02:56] <muzone> ajpiano: hey
[17:03:39] <muzone> ajpiano: you know if scott gonzales or joern zaefferer hang out in here?
[17:04:25] <rgr> can one add to the ready() function from multiple includes script files?
[17:05:10] <Eviltwin> ProLoser|Work: Riddled with bugs
[17:05:21] <Eviltwin> I think this fixes all of them: http://jsfiddle.net/LLb3s/10/
[17:05:31] <dabear> rgr: yes
[17:05:47] <Eviltwin> rgr: You can do as many readys as you want, yes
[17:05:58] <rgr> super. thanks.
[17:06:04] <ProLoser|Work> Eviltwin: is there a reason i would prefer function(){} over just {}???
[17:06:28] <Eviltwin> They mean *COMPLETELY* different things for one
[17:06:42] <ProLoser|Work> i thought they both evaluate to the same thing
[17:06:44] <rgr> when adding new elements dynamically into the dom, I guess its ok to call my ready function again in order to apply jquery filtering?
[17:06:46] <Eviltwin> Not even close
[17:06:54] <ProLoser|Work> since i can do var[], var.whatever, etc on both
[17:07:01] <dabear> they both return an object :p
[17:07:05] <Eviltwin> Kind of
[17:07:08] <Eviltwin> One's a very special kind of object
[17:07:11] <ProLoser|Work> okay well
[17:07:12] <Eviltwin> That has a different typeof
[17:07:17] <Eviltwin> And is callable
[17:07:18] <ProLoser|Work> what if i swapped em both to be function(){}
[17:07:26] <Eviltwin> Dude, I just fixed your code
[17:07:27] <Eviltwin> It works
[17:07:43] <ProLoser|Work> i realize that, i just want to understand some nuances
[17:07:51] <dabear> ProLoser|Work: this is a javascript question. you should learn javascript and not ask those questions here
[17:07:52] <dabear> :)
[17:07:56] <ProLoser|Work> like why people would use function(){} for creating objects over {}
[17:08:03] <Eviltwin> Okay, wait a sec
[17:08:13] <Eviltwin> So you understand the difference between a function and a {}, right?
[17:08:19] <ProLoser|Work> yes
[17:08:24] <ProLoser|Work> i call {} a map
[17:08:26] <ProLoser|Work> personally
[17:08:28] <imsky> ProLoser|Work: lol wat
[17:08:34] <Eviltwin> That's the idea, JavaScript calls them objects
[17:08:45] <ProLoser|Work> i get that
[17:08:51] <Eviltwin> Okay, now when building an object
[17:08:55] <Eviltwin> You have two options
[17:09:03] <Eviltwin> One is to just do { ... }
[17:09:09] <imsky> object literal
[17:09:10] <Eviltwin> At which point you have constructed one object
[17:09:20] <Eviltwin> The other is to use a function
[17:09:24] <ProLoser|Work> okay
[17:09:24] <Eviltwin> At which point that function is the constructor
[17:09:33] <Eviltwin> Meaning you can do shit in there
[17:09:37] <ProLoser|Work> but is not an object (yet)?
[17:09:40] <solidus-river> how do i get the current dom element that a live event is attached to?
[17:09:41] <Eviltwin> Before the object is built and returned
[17:09:42] <imsky> it's a main method INCORPORATING the object
[17:09:44] <solidus-river> $(this)?
[17:09:55] <Eviltwin> solidus-river: Or maybe e.target
[17:10:31] <ProLoser|Work> Eviltwin: but i can do shit inside {} too right? or do i have to call it explicitly (aka, it doesn't have a main method)
[17:10:41] <ProLoser|Work> i never thought of it as a main method before, but that helps a lot
[17:11:02] <imsky> ProLoser|Work: if you reference this inside {}, you'll reference the global scope
[17:11:03] <Eviltwin> Well you can't really do shit in the same sense you could with the other
[17:11:06] <Eviltwin> Yes
[17:11:23] <ProLoser|Work> i suppose doing var NewClass = (function(){})() means it will execute the main method when defining, where as without the closure it only executes the main method when i create new instances??
[17:11:33] <imsky> that's a self-executing function
[17:11:37] <imsky> you need to cool off on that
[17:11:41] <imsky> and learn function scope
[17:11:46] <ProLoser|Work> trying to
[17:11:54] <ProLoser|Work> what if i do { init: function() { this.whatever }}
[17:11:58] <ProLoser|Work> is that still global?
[17:12:00] <imsky> yes
[17:12:04] <ProLoser|Work> hmm
[17:12:27] <imsky> ProLoser|Work: haven't you programmed before?
[17:12:40] <ProLoser|Work> js is very very different to anything else i've worked in
[17:12:48] <imsky> what have you worked in?
[17:12:58] <ProLoser|Work> namely php and java
[17:13:13] <imsky> ok well php has block scope (afaik) for functions
[17:13:15] <Eviltwin> http://jsfiddle.net/hGGLQ/
[17:13:17] <imsky> and it's got global variables
[17:13:38] <imsky> these concepts map 1:1 for js, there's very few quirks here
[17:14:00] <ProLoser|Work> yes but in php functions weren't objects
[17:14:07] <imsky> not block scope, local scope
[17:14:10] <imsky> good job, php
[17:14:19] <imsky> this is why we can't have nice things
[17:14:30] <ProLoser|Work> ?
[17:14:39] <imsky> nothing, rusty on my terminology :D
[17:14:47] <Eviltwin> http://jsfiddle.net/hGGLQ/1/
[17:15:10] <imsky> Eviltwin: don't forget var x = function(){}
[17:16:11] <ProLoser|Work> what is the difference between returning and doing this.whatever???
[17:16:23] <imsky> wut
[17:16:28] <Eviltwin> See that "new" keyword there?
[17:16:48] <Eviltwin> That creates a new empty object, and then gives it to the function as "this"
[17:17:07] <Eviltwin> At which point the function builds the object
[17:17:12] <imsky> but if you return "bla" it doesn't!
[17:17:23] <Eviltwin> Well it does but then it doesn't give you back that object
[17:17:27] <Eviltwin> And that object goes away
[17:17:47] <imsky> weeee
[17:17:51] <Eviltwin> http://jsfiddle.net/hGGLQ/2/
[17:18:09] <ProLoser|Work> does var y = makeFoo() and var y = new makeFoo() do the same thing? therefore making returning a little bit safer?
[17:18:20] <Eviltwin> 'Cause of what we were saying about returning
[17:18:45] <Eviltwin> It just acts like a normal function call that way
[17:18:52] <Eviltwin> If the function returns something
[17:19:09] <Eviltwin> You override what it was doing
[17:20:11] <ProLoser|Work> so i can do either or, but shouldn't do both?
[17:20:26] <ProLoser|Work> or, i can do both if i wish to use this internally only?
[17:20:34] <ProLoser|Work> * this.whatever
[17:21:21] <Eviltwin> There's no logic in doing both
[17:21:25] <Eviltwin> It just wastes CPU cycles
[17:21:27] <Eviltwin> And memory
[17:22:28] <ProLoser|Work> hmm
[17:23:10] <Eviltwin> We can blow your mind with closure later
[17:23:37] <imsky> ProLoser|Work: http://bonsaiden.github.com/JavaScript-Garden/#object
[17:23:58] <rgr> what would cause an XHR to repeatedly load after a jquery ajax call? The call was successful.
[17:24:11] <ProLoser|Work> i understand that a closure should be an object that creates it's own scope, executes itself immediately, and returns an instance of itself
[17:24:19] <ProLoser|Work> *function
[17:24:43] <p3llin0r3> OH GOD HELP!
[17:25:33] <p3llin0r3> allow me to post some code. What I am trying to do, is create an element, and then surround that element with subsequent elements. So, I create an iframe, and I want to branch off of the top right of that iframe a text box with a calendar

[17:25:46] <p3llin0r3> ok i wont

[17:26:31] <ProLoser|Work> little late imsky

[17:26:33] <ProLoser|Work> lol
[17:26:47] <p3llin0r3> here is teh codexorz
[17:26:52] <imsky> little late there
[17:27:17] <p3llin0r3> I know it is a mess.
[17:27:30] <Eviltwin> Any reason you're not just setting the iframe src to this GET URL?
[17:27:37] <p3llin0r3> yeah
[17:27:45] <p3llin0r3> it is hidden by the server, I need to do it that way
[17:27:55] <Eviltwin> What is hidden by the server?
[17:27:56] <p3llin0r3> the server won't give me access unless I do this
[17:28:09] <p3llin0r3> do it that way. Don't know why. Its a workaround I came up with.
[17:28:49] <ProLoser|Work> Eviltwin: can i use extend to merge 2 objects?
[17:28:54] <ProLoser|Work> or is it only possible with maps?
[17:29:05] <ProLoser|Work> i tried tweaking the fiddle to both be functions instead of both being 'maps'
[17:29:15] <ProLoser|Work> maybe i need to use return or this first
[17:29:18] <Eviltwin> Dude, JavaScript has functions and objects
[17:29:20] <Eviltwin> No "maps"
[17:29:29] <ProLoser|Work> whatever
[17:29:32] <ProLoser|Work> object literals
[17:29:36] <context> haha
[17:30:24] <p3llin0r3> ...
[17:31:02] <ProLoser|Work> anyway, can i do that?
[17:31:03] <imsky> oh lawd
[17:31:27] <Eviltwin> var a=$("<span>"); var b=$("<b>"); b.append("Hello, World!"); a.append(b); a is now a collection contianing one element <span><b>Hello, World!</b></span>
[17:31:37] <Eviltwin> Does that help you, p3llin0r3?
[17:31:40] <Eviltwin> ProLoser|Work: Sure
[17:31:51] <imsky> Eviltwin: how dare you not <b/>
[17:32:15] <p3llin0r3> hmm
[17:32:18] <p3llin0r3> maybe.
[17:32:42] <p3llin0r3> ok, so if I hit them witht he span tag, it will make then span across the page?
[17:32:48] <imsky> NOPE
[17:32:53] <Eviltwin> "hit them with"?
[17:32:58] <imsky> hit em wit the rhythm
[17:33:01] <p3llin0r3> hah, yeah.
[17:33:19] <Eviltwin> Sounds like you might need to learn HTML
[17:33:23] <Eviltwin> Why don't you start there
[17:33:25] <imsky> buuuurn
[17:33:27] <p3llin0r3> shhhh
[17:33:55] <imsky> Eviltwin: you're so nasty
[17:36:08] <solidus-river> wil $('li.messages').length() check if it found any messages?
[17:36:18] <solidus-river> er found any li elements with the class .messages
[17:36:22] <imsky> nah bro nah
[17:36:26] <imsky> because .length() is not a method
[17:36:31] <imsky> it's a property
[17:36:45] <solidus-river> $('li.messages').length
[17:36:47] <solidus-river> ^_^
[17:37:14] <p3llin0r3> Eviltwin that was not helpful at all! >:( Did your ead my code?
[17:39:00] <p3llin0r3> Eviltwin: I think you are a strange person, touching yourself alone in your room.
[17:39:24] <imsky> this is too hawt for #jquery
[17:39:30] <Eviltwin> p3llin0r3: I think I'm suddenly less inclined to try to help you with your problem
[17:39:39] <Eviltwin> Go back to 4chan
[17:39:48] <imsky> man...just brutal
[17:39:53] <Eviltwin> I'm sure they can help you
[17:39:53] <Eviltwin> Heh
[17:40:02] <imsky> Eviltwin: the nice guys can be the meanest
[17:47:21] <someprimetime> i'm adding list items by the append() function like... append("<li>blah</li>"); and it's adding in the actual html <li style="display: list-item;">
[17:47:33] <someprimetime> is there any way to prevent it from adding that style attribute?
[17:47:50] <imsky> how sure are you that it's actually doing that
[17:48:27] <ProLoser|Work> Eviltwin: how do i extend function-objects?
[17:48:42] <ProLoser|Work> i tried making all the object literals into functions and then used this.attr = whatever
[17:48:48] <Eviltwin> ProLoser|Work: Create an instance of the object (via new or whatever) and extend tht
[17:48:51] <ProLoser|Work> do i need to return an object literal?
[17:48:51] <Eviltwin> that*
[17:49:24] <ProLoser|Work> so i can't simply put function(){} as the first argument?
[17:49:42] <ProLoser|Work> i want to extend my base class by my subclass
[17:49:50] <ProLoser|Work> without modifying the base class
[17:49:52] <Eviltwin> So this is where the difference between function(){} and {} comes into play
[17:50:00] <ProLoser|Work> 1 sec
[17:50:06] <ProLoser|Work> http://jsfiddle.net/LLb3s/13/
[17:50:19] <ProLoser|Work> do i need to wrap the first function in a self executing setup?
[17:50:33] <Eviltwin> Depends on what you want it to be
[17:50:48] <Eviltwin> You can think of function(){} as the "class" and {} as the "instance" (sort of)
[17:50:58] <Eviltwin> Do you want jv.View to be the class or an instance of the class?
[17:51:08] <ProLoser|Work> well i put function(){} as the first param of $.extend() because i don't want to ruin my base class
[17:51:16] <ProLoser|Work> jv.View is my base class
[17:51:22] <ProLoser|Work> i want searchFilter to extend it
[17:51:40] <Eviltwin> So you don't want to do jv.View.<something>, you want to instantiate a jv.View then act on that?
[17:52:08] <Eviltwin> You said you did Java, right?
[17:52:17] <ProLoser|Work> yes
[17:52:21] <ProLoser|Work> and yes to your previous statement
[17:52:32] <Eviltwin> Okay, do unlike Java
[17:52:39] <Eviltwin> You don't extend a class, you extend a class instance
[17:52:51] <ProLoser|Work> i got that, but i want to preserve the parent
[17:52:55] <Eviltwin> So instead of extending jv.View, you actually want to extend a new jv.View
[17:53:07] <Eviltwin> new jv.View() instead of just jv.View
[17:53:09] <Eviltwin> Should work
[17:53:17] <Eviltwin> Where you're extending
[17:53:29] <Eviltwin> Now the next question
[17:53:35] <Eviltwin> Do you want searchFilter to be a class or an instance?
[17:54:08] <imsky> wow, how did we go from 920 users to 791
[17:54:10] <ProLoser|Work> instance
[17:54:15] <Eviltwin> Okay, good,
[17:54:16] <ProLoser|Work> i don't actually need a whole 'bother class
[17:54:18] <Eviltwin> So instead of function(){},
[17:54:20] <Eviltwin> Use {}
[17:54:25] <ProLoser|Work> tried
[17:54:26] <ProLoser|Work> it didn't work
[17:54:50] <ProLoser|Work> http://jsfiddle.net/LLb3s/14/
[17:54:58] <Eviltwin> Do you not want to use object literals?
[17:55:11] <ProLoser|Work> well there seems to be a benefit to NOT using literals, correct?
[17:55:26] <ProLoser|Work> namely, the code i put inside the regular objects are scoped
[17:55:33] <ProLoser|Work> where as in a literal, this refers to window
[17:55:36] <ProLoser|Work> or is this inaccurate?
[17:55:58] <Eviltwin> You mostly have the idea but what you're doing at the extend line is a little different that what you're doing at the js.View block
[17:56:08] <Eviltwin> As js.View, you're creating a "class"
[17:56:15] <Eviltwin> At searchFilder, you're creating an "instance"
[17:56:20] <Eviltwin> An object literal is an "instance"
[17:56:29] <Eviltwin> A function-based object is a "class"
[17:56:56] <Eviltwin> So in the extend line, we don't want to have the function(){} bit, we want to have an object literal for what you're adding
[17:56:59] <Eviltwin> Does that make sense?
[17:57:07] <ProLoser|Work> yes
[17:57:14] <ProLoser|Work> but if you check the fiddle, that failed to work
[17:57:38] <Eviltwin> So first, extend operates entirely on "instances"
[17:57:44] <Eviltwin> And your second arg is a "class"
[17:57:55] <Eviltwin> So the easiest fix is to instantiate the "class"
[17:58:08] <Eviltwin> Your third argument is also a "class"
[17:58:17] <Eviltwin> But since you're defining it there inline
[17:58:26] <Eviltwin> We can just make this an object literal instead
[17:58:39] <Eviltwin> Does that make sense?
[17:58:41] <ProLoser|Work> yes
[17:58:48] <ProLoser|Work> but do i still retain the benefits of scope?
[17:59:03] <ProLoser|Work> like the third argument is probably where my custom code comes in, and i will make heavy use of this in there
[17:59:05] <ProLoser|Work> will that work?
[17:59:13] <Eviltwin> Which scope in particular?
[17:59:35] <ProLoser|Work> well if the third argument has { init: fn(){ this.whatever} } is that going to use the window?
[17:59:46] <ProLoser|Work> or is that going to refer to the object created by $.extend()?
[17:59:54] <Eviltwin> The object created by $.extend
[18:00:02] <ProLoser|Work> okay
[18:00:03] <Eviltwin> this is kind of magical
[18:00:06] <Eviltwin> I'll make an example for you
[18:00:11] <Eviltwin> In the mean time
[18:00:12] <Eviltwin> Look at http://jsfiddle.net/LLb3s/15/
[18:00:18] <ProLoser|Work> quick question
[18:00:33] <ProLoser|Work> is the reason BECAUSE the time those methods are called/executed, they then reside inside an object?
[18:00:45] <ProLoser|Work> even though they were declared in an object literal?
[18:01:04] <Eviltwin> this referes to whatever object they're a part of when the code is executed, correct
[18:02:42] <ProLoser|Work> okay
[18:03:09] <Eviltwin> ProLoser|Work: http://jsfiddle.net/HFzpL/
[18:03:27] <Eviltwin> Does that make sense?
[18:03:47] <ProLoser|Work> yes i understand that
[18:04:09] <ProLoser|Work> okay, with that in mind, and hopefully with you having some idea of what i'm trying to do, i have a more jquery-related question
[18:04:16] <Eviltwin> K
[18:04:19] <Eviltwin> Shoot
[18:04:50] <ProLoser|Work> actually… nvm i may have just realized the err in my ways lol
[18:04:54] <Eviltwin> Heh
[18:04:56] <Eviltwin> Well let me know
[18:05:03] <ProLoser|Work> the comments in the bin state "how do we pass data to the view instances"
[18:05:14] <ProLoser|Work> but i realized i could just store it as properties from within init()
[18:05:24] <Eviltwin> There was one mistake you kept making
[18:05:28] <Eviltwin> And what was with the $.delegate
[18:05:31] <ProLoser|Work> my coworker tried explicitly passing it to the event callbacks, which was not succeeding
[18:05:42] <ProLoser|Work> which is?
[18:05:45] <Eviltwin> You were doing $(this.el).delegate(bindings[1], bindings[0], this[value]());
[18:05:59] <Eviltwin> I changed it to $(this.el).delegate(bindings[1], bindings[0], this[value]);
[18:06:04] <Eviltwin> Do you understand the difference?
[18:06:35] <ProLoser|Work> yes, instead of firing the fn at the time of bind and returning the result, it's actually executing the fn at the time of trigger
[18:06:50] <Eviltwin> Correct
[18:07:01] <Eviltwin> In the first, it'll bind whatever this[value]() returns
[18:07:12] <Eviltwin> Which is probably undefined
[18:07:13] <ProLoser|Work> ya
[18:07:24] <Eviltwin> Now there's one more thing about that that's probably going to screw you over
[18:07:32] <ProLoser|Work> ?
[18:07:37] <Eviltwin> And it has to do with the behavior of this
[18:08:41] <ProLoser|Work> ?
[18:08:44] <Eviltwin> http://jsfiddle.net/3ecph/
[18:08:46] <ProLoser|Work> is that why you did $.proxy()
[18:08:50] <Eviltwin> Yes
[18:08:57] <Eviltwin> Do you know what $.proxy does?
[18:09:02] <ProLoser|Work> nope
[18:09:13] <Eviltwin> It makes the "this" inside that function be whatever the thing you specify at the end is
[18:09:26] <ProLoser|Work> so it lets you forcibly change the scope?
[18:09:31] <Eviltwin> Yes
[18:10:04] <Eviltwin> http://jsfiddle.net/3ecph/1/
[18:10:53] <Eviltwin> So that first alert
[18:10:58] <Eviltwin> Shows "Hello, World!"
[18:11:03] <Eviltwin> But the second shows "undefined"
[18:11:11] <Eviltwin> Then the third dhows "Hello, World!"
[18:11:22] <Eviltwin> This is because the scope for the second one is different
[18:11:58] <Eviltwin> So instead of just $(this.el).delegate(bindings[1], bindings[0], this[value]);
[18:12:04] <Eviltwin> You're probably going to want $(this.el).delegate(bindings[1], bindings[0], $.proxy(this[value],this));
[18:12:17] <Eviltwin> Otherwise the function it calls could have the wrong scope
[18:12:31] <Eviltwin> In fact will almost certainly have the wrong scope
[18:13:13] <Eviltwin> So if you find yourself doing object.function and passing that somewhere instead of just directly calling object.function()
[18:13:24] <Eviltwin> You're probably going to want to $.proxy(object.function,object) instead of just passing it along
[18:13:34] <Eviltwin> Make sense?
[18:13:39] <Eviltwin> $.proxy locks the scope
[18:19:03] <ProLoser|Work> ok
[18:19:22] <ProLoser|Work> so it's because doing this[value] will not retain the scope
[18:19:32] <ProLoser|Work> cool
[18:20:12] <ProLoser|Work> i'm a little confused as to what the scope would have been then, does this[value] = function() { } have it's own scope it would have used instead?
[18:23:06] <Eviltwin> So here's where things are kinda interesting
[18:23:43] <Eviltwin> The scope of variables are determined based on where the function is declared
[18:24:03] <Eviltwin> The scope of "this" is determined based on where the function is called
[18:24:04] <slavka`> hey guys im sure everyone here has heard of reCapture... im just curious if anyone has got it to work over JSONP instead of ajax
[18:24:55] <Eviltwin> ProLoser|Work: For any function f, if you put a copy in an object then call a.f()
[18:25:02] <Eviltwin> "this" will be a
[18:25:20] <Eviltwin> If you put a copy of the exact same object in an object b
[18:25:25] <Eviltwin> Then do b.f(), the "this" will be b
[18:25:33] <Eviltwin> The function doesn't change, the "this" does
[18:25:44] <ProLoser|Work> okay
[18:26:06] <Eviltwin> Does that make sense?
[18:26:22] <Eviltwin> This is why you can just copy objects by copying all the keys into a new object
[18:26:28] <Eviltwin> (Which is what $.extend does)
[18:27:36] <ProLoser|Work> so why doesn't this work: http://jsfiddle.net/LLb3s/16/
[18:27:56] <ProLoser|Work> am i wrong to be using proxy on the first $.each()
[18:28:29] <ProLoser|Work> i've tried it with and without
[18:28:59] <Eviltwin> The thing you needed to proxy was in the call to delegate
[18:29:13] <Eviltwin> Instead of this[value], $.proxy(this[value],this)
[18:29:25] <Eviltwin> Whenever you're pulling a function out of an object and passing it along, you probably need to proxy
[18:29:49] <ProLoser|Work> right.. not sure where i got this wrong version from :/
[18:31:12] <Eviltwin> http://jsfiddle.net/LLb3s/19/
[18:31:35] <ProLoser|Work> i see 3 proxies now
[18:31:51] <ProLoser|Work> all of them are necessary?
[18:32:53] <Eviltwin> One of them is absolutely necessary, the other two could technically be eliminated
[18:33:13] <ProLoser|Work> i also don't 100% follow the whole scope of declared vs called, only because i kind of got the impression that despite being declared, if it's not executed then wouldn't everything be relevant to where it's called
[18:33:20] <ProLoser|Work> technically?
[18:33:28] <ProLoser|Work> so it's just a redundant precaution?
[18:33:55] <Eviltwin> Not, exactly, there's something called closure that makes this whole thing very complicated (and powerful)
[18:35:19] <ProLoser|Work> ok
[18:35:27] <Eviltwin> Here's a simple example of closure: http://jsfiddle.net/rUhPn/
[18:35:40] <Eviltwin> See that function(m) { ... } bit?
[18:35:58] <Eviltwin> Because it's *inside* the adder function, it has access to any of the variables that adder function had when it was called
[18:36:01] <Eviltwin> Namely "n"
[18:36:16] <Eviltwin> Which means that when I call adder(2)
[18:36:25] <Eviltwin> The function that is returned will *always* add 2 to the number I put in
[18:36:51] <Eviltwin> That scope depends on where the function was declared
[18:37:38] <Eviltwin> It may seem a little confusing
[18:37:44] <Eviltwin> Or it may be pretty straightfoward
[18:37:53] <Eviltwin> It's also a super simple example
[18:38:05] <Eviltwin> It can get a lot more complicated
[18:38:44] <Eviltwin> You use $.proxy(function(){...},<object>) to make that object the "this" inside that function
[18:38:47] <Eviltwin> When it's called
[18:39:11] <Eviltwin> However you could also do "var me = this;"
[18:39:16] <ProLoser|Work> well see i get how the inner function can access n
[18:39:20] <Eviltwin> And then inside your function refer to "me"
[18:39:30] <ProLoser|Work> but when you start talking about `this` it becomes difficult to know which instance you're referring to
[18:40:20] <Eviltwin> Okay, want me to explain how this is actually controlled?
[18:40:25] <Eviltwin> That might settle this
[18:40:32] <ProLoser|Work> sure
[18:41:01] <Eviltwin> Say you do function f(a) { alert(a) } out in window scope
[18:41:07] <Eviltwin> Then you do f(2)
[18:41:23] <ProLoser|Work> okay
[18:41:33] <Eviltwin> That's the same thing as f.call(window,2)
[18:41:51] <Eviltwin> .call is very similar to just calling the function directly
[18:41:58] <Eviltwin> Except it allows you to specify the "this"
[18:42:05] <Eviltwin> As the first argument
[18:42:18] <Eviltwin> And the remaining arguments are passed to the function as the other variables
[18:42:27] <Eviltwin> Now say you have a.f(2) instead
[18:42:38] <Eviltwin> That basically becomes f.call(a,2)
[18:42:47] <Eviltwin> So inside that call, the "this" will be a instead
[18:43:06] <Eviltwin> <X>.<Y>(<Z>) is identical to <Y>.call(<X>,<Z>)
[18:43:25] <Eviltwin> So for any call <X>.<Y>(<Z>), the "this" inside will be <X>
[18:44:00] <Eviltwin> Does that make sense?
[18:45:04] <Eviltwin> http://bonsaiden.github.com/JavaScript-Garden/#function.this
[18:45:17] <ProLoser|Work> i think i get it
[18:45:23] <ProLoser|Work> i mean, most of it seems straight forwards
[18:45:31] <ProLoser|Work> so the confusion is complex scenarios like the one we had before
[18:45:47] <ProLoser|Work> should i have assumed that in fact the scope was window because i was calling init() from within window?
[18:45:49] <Eviltwin> So this doesn't act like quite a normal variable but it gets passed to the function when the function is called
[18:46:04] <Eviltwin> The scope isn't window, it's searchFilter
[18:46:14] <Eviltwin> Because you're saying searchFilter.init({name:"sam"})
[18:46:25] <ProLoser|Work> right nvm
[18:46:31] <ProLoser|Work> so i didn't get why the other fn's broke
[18:46:51] <Eviltwin> So when a function is actually running
[18:46:56] <Eviltwin> "this" refers to some object
[18:47:05] <Eviltwin> But with each new function call that happens, the "this" can be different
[18:47:26] <Eviltwin> Read the section of that link I sent
[18:47:38] <Eviltwin> It's probably clearer
[18:50:16] <Eviltwin> This stuff is somewhat second nature to be because I've been doing it so long
[18:50:23] <Eviltwin> So I have a hard time explaining it
[18:50:26] <Eviltwin> And how it works
[18:50:36] <Eviltwin> And why it works that way
[18:52:21] <ProLoser|Work> wait wait wait
[18:52:52] <ProLoser|Work> doing function whatever() {} inside an object (or anything else for that matter) ALWAYS refers to the global object?
[18:53:13] <ProLoser|Work> so i could be like 3 levels down and if i do function whatever(){} then `this` inside is the global object?
[18:53:45] <Eviltwin> When you make a function call and that function call isn't like <A>.whatever(), then "this" will be the global object
[18:54:00] <ProLoser|Work> no matter how deep i am
[18:54:03] <Eviltwin> Correct
[18:54:08] <ProLoser|Work> interesting
[18:54:17] <Eviltwin> However all the other variables declared in all those scopes
[18:54:23] <Eviltwin> Every level on the way up,
[18:54:27] <ProLoser|Work> i had no idea about that, for some reason i would have assumed at the very least it would go 1 step up (if at all)
[18:54:28] <Eviltwin> Those are all bound
[18:54:36] <Eviltwin> And you have access to all of them
[18:55:08] <Eviltwin> Take a look at this: http://jsfiddle.net/LLb3s/21/
[18:55:12] <Eviltwin> See how I have "var me = this"
[18:55:22] <Eviltwin> Then inside that .each, I refer to "me" instead of this?
[18:55:33] <ProLoser|Work> so inside function whatever() { } if i do this.newVar = whatever, or var newVar = whatever i'm actually messing with the global scope?
[18:55:40] <Eviltwin> Any function (anonymous or otherwise) declared inside this.init, will have access to the variable "me"
[18:55:50] <Eviltwin> And it will point to the object init was called on
[18:56:04] <Eviltwin> this.newVar, yes var newVar no
[18:56:20] <Eviltwin> The var keyword makes it part of that function's scope
[18:56:30] <Eviltwin> Nothing outside that function will have access to it
[18:56:34] <ProLoser|Work> so is this the alternative to using proxy 3 times?
[18:56:50] <ProLoser|Work> (by this i mean't this example)
[18:58:17] <ProLoser|Work> man
[18:58:27] <ProLoser|Work> so i'm reading about the assigning methods
[18:58:37] <ProLoser|Work> var test = someObject.methodTest;
[18:58:49] <ProLoser|Work> and how inside test(); `this` no longer refers to someObject
[18:58:53] <Eviltwin> Yup
[18:58:55] <Eviltwin> That's what I was trying to explain
[18:59:05] <Eviltwin> (In fact I sent a jsFiddle example earlier)
[18:59:11] <ProLoser|Work> well i never got the nuances of why i should use prototype or not
[18:59:26] <Eviltwin> prototype is a whole nother thing
[18:59:28] <ProLoser|Work> i only looked at prototype as a way for 1 instance to supplement a previous instance (or class)
[18:59:33] <Eviltwin> I was trying not to overload you
[19:00:08] <Eviltwin> Don't read much into "Closures and References" or past if you want to not be overloaded
[19:00:16] <ProLoser|Work> heh
[19:00:20] <Eviltwin> There's A LOT going on in JavaScript
[19:00:23] <ProLoser|Work> problem is that these issues have come up quite a lot
[19:00:26] <Eviltwin> And you're just trying to get this working
[19:00:39] <ProLoser|Work> we found some sort of bug with jquery-tmpl too
[19:00:45] <ProLoser|Work> and it was all due to references
[19:01:00] <Eviltwin> Probably not proxying
[19:01:02] <ProLoser|Work> although it's such a pain to reproduce i haen't made a ticket for it yet
[19:01:04] <ProLoser|Work> well
[19:01:14] <Eviltwin> Same thing will happen with jQuery
[19:01:15] <ProLoser|Work> 1 issue is i seemed to be unable to do 2 fn's in the template
[19:01:29] <Eviltwin> var app = $("body").append
[19:01:33] <Eviltwin> app("Hello, World!")
[19:01:35] <ProLoser|Work> {{tmpl(someUtilFunction(anotherUtilFunction())) '#someId'}}
[19:01:36] <Eviltwin> Will break
[19:01:38] <ProLoser|Work> the inner function failed
[19:02:13] <ProLoser|Work> does app.append = $(body).append; work?
[19:02:24] <ProLoser|Work> or do i have to do app.prototype.append = $(body).append
[19:02:25] <Eviltwin> Well what is app?
[19:02:35] <ProLoser|Work> in this example, just another instance/object?
[19:02:42] <Eviltwin> Here app is a function
[19:02:47] <Eviltwin> A function stripped from the jQuery object
[19:03:33] <Eviltwin> What I could do is var app = function(s) { $("body").append(s) };
[19:03:47] <Eviltwin> And then app("Hello, World!") will work
[19:03:55] <Eviltwin> But if I just strip the function out
[19:04:01] <Eviltwin> It has no idea what to act on
[19:04:29] <ProLoser|Work> so it loses the <object>.whatever() part?
[19:04:35] <ProLoser|Work> or i mean the <object>
[19:04:43] <Eviltwin> In that first exampe, yes.
[19:04:47] <Eviltwin> var app = $("body").append
[19:05:29] <ProLoser|Work> hmm
[19:05:31] <ProLoser|Work> okay
[19:05:40] <Eviltwin> app("Hello, World!") will be trying to reference stuff in the global object
[19:05:44] <ProLoser|Work> anyway, i want to dive into prototypes, but i think i'd start forgetting stuff if i do that right now
[19:05:47] <Eviltwin> Thinking it's a jQuery object
[19:05:57] <Eviltwin> If you want to do it right
[19:06:03] <Eviltwin> Start at the top of that document
[19:06:07] <Eviltwin> And work through
[19:06:13] <Eviltwin> They introduce topics in a good order
[19:06:21] <ProLoser|Work> bookmarked
[19:06:31] <Eviltwin> And you'll know all the most powerful tricks in JavaScript
[19:06:41] <ProLoser|Work> i've spent the past 4 days though reading documentation on backbone and spine and extending and a shit-ton of crap on mvc and classes in js
[19:07:37] <ProLoser|Work> alright i should get home before i become completely incapable of finding parking
[19:07:41] <ProLoser|Work> thanks for all the help
[19:07:44] <ProLoser|Work> Eviltwin++
[19:07:46] <Eviltwin> Heh
[19:07:49] <Eviltwin> You're welcome
[19:07:59] <ProLoser|Work> i realize i've been a bit of a support vampire tonight
[19:08:42] <ProLoser|Work> see now that i have my view class, and can make a model class, my only concern is building a factory properly
[19:09:09] <Eviltwin> Once you get through that doc, you'll know everything you have access to
[19:09:11] <Eviltwin> And what it does
[19:09:27] <Eviltwin> Once you have all the pieces, you can focus on assmebling the puzzle
[19:12:37] <ProLoser|Work> well that's the thing, i've had an idea of how to put my puzzle together, but i didn't know the exact syntax or way to go about doing so
[19:12:50] <ProLoser|Work> see right now there are a few things i wish to implement
[19:13:23] <ProLoser|Work> 1 is a wrapper for $.ajax() in my model class that uses deferred to expedite the loading of the app (and hopefully at the sometime provide caching/memoization)
[19:13:57] <ProLoser|Work> 2 is that i want to create a factory to delegate loading of assets (namely, for right now, this refers specifically to plugins and third party apis, such as Facebook and our own restful backend)
[19:14:43] <ProLoser|Work> we are doing a client-side heavy app, but it's not entirely 1 page, so there are some pages without forms, therefore we don't need form validation/html5 polyfills loaded
[19:15:04] <ProLoser|Work> other pages make no usage of the $_GET params so there's no point to load the query parser, and other such issues
[19:15:19] <ProLoser|Work> however i'm concerned (as I usually am as an OCD individual) that i'm going about things incorrectly
[19:15:36] <Eviltwin> Well learn the tools first, then worry about if you're using them correctly
[19:15:46] <Eviltwin> You're not doing yourself any services my not knowing what tools are available
[19:20:13] <ProLoser|Work> when would i want to use a closure?
[19:20:51] <Eviltwin> You probably use it all the time and maybe just don't realize
[19:21:10] <Eviltwin> Any time you're using a variable inside a function that's not immediately declared inside that function, it's using closure
[19:21:45] <ProLoser|Work> http://jsfiddle.net/Gz7Pc/
[19:22:08] <ProLoser|Work> inside jv.Factory.asset(), inits[pluginName] is not referring to the correct scope
[19:22:37] <ProLoser|Work> should i be doing jv.Factory = function() {} or should i be doing jv.Factory = (function(){})();
[19:22:43] <Eviltwin> You haven'y declared any variable inits
[19:22:52] <Eviltwin> This is where the object literal makes you cry
[19:22:58] <Eviltwin> Either you need to use this.inits
[19:23:00] <ProLoser|Work> i've declared jv.Factory.inits
[19:23:25] <Eviltwin> Why do you have cache and inits with = instead of :?
[19:23:41] <ProLoser|Work> ya i just noticed that
[19:23:47] <ProLoser|Work> this was a theoretical pro type, it was untesetd
[19:23:59] <ProLoser|Work> i think i was trying to figure out if i should be using an object literal, a function or a closure
[19:24:18] <Eviltwin> Probably object literal for what you're doing there
[19:24:36] <ProLoser|Work> well i don't really want inits and cache to be publicly accessible
[19:24:48] <ProLoser|Work> is it possible to wrap it in a function and then do var cache = {};
[19:24:55] <Eviltwin> Yes
[19:25:04] <ProLoser|Work> that would make it private, correct?
[19:25:19] <Eviltwin> Basically
[19:25:26] <Eviltwin> I mean nothing's *truly* private
[19:25:31] <ProLoser|Work> i understand that
[19:25:43] <Eviltwin> But that'd be as close as you can get in JavaScript
[19:25:53] <ProLoser|Work> so now my other confusion is should i be returning an object literal or simply use this.whatever for each publicly accessible item?
[19:25:53] <Eviltwin> But be careful, even you won't be able to acces it directly from outside that function
[19:26:12] <ProLoser|Work> what if i create a getter/setter?
[19:26:23] <Eviltwin> But then why not just expose it?
[19:26:34] <ProLoser|Work> well i didn't really intend to
[19:26:53] <ProLoser|Work> but my original point is, if i call jv.Factory.asset(), does THAT method still retain access? and is it persistent across calls?
[19:26:58] <Aquaguy> is there any way or any plugin that changes the font size of an input so it's value's width fits the inner width of the input?
[19:27:23] <Eviltwin> ProLoser|Work: Yes, that's how closure works. The variable scope of functions depend on where they were *declared* in the code
[19:27:37] <Aquaguy> Something like what happens in the iPhone's UITableViewCell
[19:27:40] <ProLoser|Work> Aquaguy: never heard of one, sounds like too many variables, but you could probably try writing your own for a monospaced font or something
[19:27:47] <Eviltwin> Aquaguy: Not natively, no
[19:28:16] <Aquaguy> what a shame, I think It could be interesting
[19:28:25] <ProLoser|Work> so if i want to create private vars (var cache = {}) should i use a closure or just a simple function?
[19:28:35] <ProLoser|Work> or maybe my labels are wrong, should i be using a self-executing function?
[19:28:44] <ProLoser|Work> and should i use return {} or this.whatever
[19:29:15] <ProLoser|Work> these are nuances i don't understand the differences in (fully), my only guess is that self-executing functions allow me to execute some logic upon declaration
[19:29:37] <ProLoser|Work> Aquaguy: in what way?
[19:30:12] <ProLoser|Work> Aquaguy: try setting the text-align to justify, and 'hiding' a wordwrap
[19:30:32] <Eviltwin> http://jsfiddle.net/g7Gww/
[19:31:27] <ProLoser|Work> the last line totally throws me
[19:31:46] <ProLoser|Work> so it's merely accessing cache as it resides within Factory?
[19:31:53] <Eviltwin> Nope
[19:31:58] <Eviltwin> cache doesn't reside in Factory
[19:32:03] <Eviltwin> Factory.cache doesn't work
[19:32:29] <ProLoser|Work> so it resides within (function(){})
[19:32:36] <ProLoser|Work> and both factory and iic have access to it
[19:32:40] <Eviltwin> But look at where function(x) { return !!cache[x]; }; is in the code
[19:32:54] <Eviltwin> It will have access to the cache where it's defined in the code
[19:33:20] <ProLoser|Work> okay
[19:33:22] <Eviltwin> Access to all variables is determined this way
[19:33:30] <Eviltwin> "this" is an exception
[19:33:34] <Eviltwin> It's also not really a variable
[19:33:41] <Eviltwin> For example you can't do this = x; or whatever
[19:33:54] <ProLoser|Work> is this why i would want to return vs do this.foo
[19:34:39] <ProLoser|Work> http://jsfiddle.net/g7Gww/1/
[19:34:51] <Eviltwin> Does what fail?
[19:35:00] <ProLoser|Work> iic("a")
[19:35:20] <Eviltwin> Well your braces don't quite line up
[19:35:21] <ProLoser|Work> by fail i mean fail to access cache
[19:35:41] <ProLoser|Work> ah right i missed one
[19:35:45] <Eviltwin> That function, function(x) { return !!cache[x]; }; in that location, however you get a copy of it
[19:35:45] <ProLoser|Work> well assuming no syntax errors :)
[19:35:53] <Eviltwin> Will ALWAYS refer to that cache
[19:36:22] <ProLoser|Work> well my concern is does the approach to declaring the method affect anything?
[19:36:25] <ProLoser|Work> or is it irrelevant?
[19:36:52] <Eviltwin> It's irrelevant
[19:37:00] <Eviltwin> You just need to be careful with what scope cache is in
[19:37:40] <Eviltwin> Personally I find closure a whole lot more intuitive than "this"
[19:37:53] <ProLoser|Work> what do you mean?
[19:38:04] <Eviltwin> I just go up the layers of function(){}'s and anything in those layers is part of my scope
[19:38:07] <Eviltwin> And will always be part of my scope
[19:39:26] <Eviltwin> It's static, fixed
[19:39:32] <Eviltwin> My scope will never change
[19:39:41] <Eviltwin> However "this" does change depending on how the function is called
[19:41:43] <ProLoser|Work> so i'm probably safer then working with return rather than this
[19:41:55] <ProLoser|Work> cuz then i won't accidentally change what i'm attaching this to?
[19:42:08] <ProLoser|Work> or is that only from WITHIN the functions that were made publicly visible
[19:42:22] <ProLoser|Work> or is that irrelevant
[19:42:39] <ProLoser|Work> wait, sorry, maybe i'm mixed up
[19:42:41] <Eviltwin> Well then you know you're making a new object
[19:42:57] <Eviltwin> If you have a function and you're changing this inside, you don't control what this is
[19:43:00] <Eviltwin> Closure: http://jsfiddle.net/BFB8r/
[19:43:03] <Eviltwin> Sorry, I gotta go
[19:43:41] <ProLoser|Work> thanks
[19:50:34] <avent> Eviltwin: Hi there :) Are you busy this time around?
[19:55:30] <ProLoser|Work> he head out
[19:55:34] <ProLoser|Work> what's up?
[19:56:51] <avent> I had a question about validating form input but I solved it myself :)
[19:56:57] <avent> Thanks though =)
[20:05:48] <solidus-river> how can i test jquery live on my site
[20:06:02] <solidus-river> like if i enter jquery commands into a console debug window are they live?
[20:07:40] <solidus-river> lol, nevermind, that was a lame error
[20:22:36] <onats> hi guys, is there a jquery menu that i can use, that is hosted somewhere? im trying to save on bandwidth on my vps
[20:23:57] <Spadeski> onats LMAO ROFL PMSL
[20:25:05] <onats> STFU:)
[20:26:26] <Spadeski> onats: Perhaps switch to css ?
[20:26:32] <Spadeski> without jquery
[20:27:25] <onats> im not an expert that much on css/jquery. so im relying on libraries. thus the question
[20:27:53] <onats> do you have a suggestion? like a prepackaged menu that's lightweight
[20:30:43] <Spadeski> hmm
[20:30:55] <Spadeski> well a menu is pretty easy and not that much bandwith too begin with
[20:31:17] <Spadeski> Trying to make a silder like shown http://www.xtremefx.com/ Anyone?
[20:45:24] <Spadeski> anyone
[20:54:15] <Enchilada> I have a css class which just does   display:none   called   "hide".    Then I have some jQuery code     $('p').addClass('hide').
[20:54:45] <Enchilada> Where exactly should I place the jQuery code to avoid my website from "blinking" at the beginning, i.e. to have those elements visible for a split second before disappearing?
[20:55:05] <Enchilada>  $(document).ready(function(){   doesn't appear to be working
[20:59:32] <warrenparsons> Enchilada: That's pretty much unavoidable with the approach you're taking.
[21:00:15] <htoothrot> why can't you put it in html
[21:00:20] <Enchilada> warrenparsons: the reason why i want to hide with javascript is that I don't want the website to be invisible for users with JS disabled
[21:00:24] <htoothrot> oh
[21:00:52] <Enchilada> (by the way, jQuery is then later used to show those elements with animation upon request, if JS is enabled)
[21:01:10] <Enchilada> Any better ways to accomplish such a thing?
[21:01:44] <warrenparsons> Enchilada: You could use non-jQuery JS in the head to add a class to the HTML or body tag, and use that in conjunction with a class applied to your elements directly in the HTML to hide them.
[21:01:56] <warrenparsons> That way it's not waiting for the document to complete before firing.
[21:02:26] <warrenparsons> Something like this in your CSS: html.jsApplied p.hidden { display: none; }
[21:02:41] <warrenparsons> Then apply the .jsApplied class to the HTML tag in raw JS in the head.
[21:02:55] <warrenparsons> Or similarly on the body tag, and put the pertinent JS just inside the body.
[21:03:04] <Enchilada> warrenparsons: oh, so plain JS doesn't wait for the whole doc to load first, but jQuery JS does?
[21:03:16] <warrenparsons> Enchilada: It only waits if you tell it to.
[21:03:38] <Enchilada> i don't recall telling it to..
[21:04:13] <Enchilada> so what's the fundamental difference in adding the class with plain-JS vs. jQuery?
[21:04:22] <warrenparsons> If you put a simple document.getElementById('myBodyId').className = 'jsApplied'; in the document, it fires as soon as the browser gets to it.
[21:05:05] <warrenparsons> You could do the same with jQuery, but you usually don't want to load jQuery until the bottom of the body tag, because it's an expensive transaction with the server.
[21:05:39] <htoothrot> all of this is good advice
[21:06:01] <Enchilada> will JavaScript the Good Parts teach me about this stuff
[21:06:01] <Enchilada> ?
[21:06:38] <warrenparsons> Enchilada: quite a bit of it.
[21:07:11] <Enchilada> ok, so basically, i should just forget about doing this in the document.ready?
[21:07:15] <warrenparsons> The $(document).ready is what's tripping you up, because you want to hide your elements before the document is completely loaded, to avoid the flash.
[21:07:21] <Enchilada> ah ok
[21:07:36] <warrenparsons> Enchilada: that'll only help if you're loading jQuery in the document head, which isn't ideal in the first place.
[21:07:38] <Enchilada> and jQuery stuff has to be in there, right?
[21:09:16] <warrenparsons> I'd probably use a raw JS solution to hide those few elements, putting it in the head or top of the body. Then use jQuery for everything else.
[21:09:24] <Enchilada> okay
[21:09:37] <bapi_> any real error in this string? $('#container span.text').live().each(function() {        } );
[21:09:43] <warrenparsons> Just remember your JS has to come after the element you want to affect.
[21:09:49] <warrenparsons> If it's not in a doc ready.
[21:09:54] <Enchilada> ah ok
[21:09:58] <bapi_> that line generates a "b is undefined" in jquery error output
[21:10:02] <bapi_> javascript*
[21:10:07] <warrenparsons> And that's where the contextual class on the body or HTML comes in.
[21:10:16] <Enchilada> By the way, the good parts, flipping through its contents, seems to cover only the JS syntax, not what actually happens in the browser as it loads up. could this be?
[21:10:24] <bapi_> like this: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3763444/jquery-b-is-undefined-during-animate-callback
[21:10:26] <Enchilada> Seem to be two separate things. Hmm.
[21:10:35] <bapi_> problem is that it generates the error even when I have 0 code in it
[21:10:49] <warrenparsons> Enchilada: Maybe. Check out High Performance Websites by Steve Souders for more on that stuff. Souders is a genius.
[21:10:50] <coldhead> the good parts is just about js, not front end development
[21:10:55] <coldhead> that's what it's called the good parts
[21:11:09] <Enchilada> ok, nice. thanks
[21:11:51] <warrenparsons> I'm signing off. Good luck.
[21:13:02] <coldhead> bot-t: tell warrenparsons i will never forget you

[22:37:08] <bitwise_> yeah the .replaceWith('<div>Next</div>') seems to clobber the old object
[22:47:45] <bitwise_> also i was dealing with jQuery elements and not DOM elements so i think thats where some of my confusion was
[23:04:52] <rgr> cant find it in chrom docs : where is the option to turn on xhr request logging in the console/inspector so I can see jquery ajax calls being fired?
[23:07:22] <rgr> bitwise_: just to confirm replaceWith didn work for me either as expected, instead went back to $("#id" + id).after(newe).remove();
[23:09:27] <rgr> oh thats lame. he xhr logging is right click in console. doh.
[23:16:41] <bitwise_> thx rgr
[23:22:35] <Spadeski>  /join #hl2
[23:26:00] <Spadeski> I want to make a div scroll horizontally ?
[23:33:02] <rgr> any ideas valued : I cant twiddle it. What might calla a jquery ajax / xhr request to keep firing long after the first time?
[23:33:14] <rgr> s/calls/cause
[23:40:04] <jita> is there a way to check if the content of the division is not empty. Like if (e.html is empty)
[23:40:06] <jita> Something like this
[23:43:52] <paul_irish_> $(div).children().length
[23:47:03] <solidus-river> is this appropriate? $('.newconversations .new_conversation_count').text(++new_conversation_count);
[23:47:10] <solidus-river> or do i have to pass it a string
[23:47:19] <solidus-river> new_conversation_count is an integer
[23:47:38] <bapi_> ehm, is it possible to monitor a jscript varaible with jquery?
[23:47:39] <solidus-river> is it smart enough to convert to string?
[23:47:51] <bapi_> I want jquery to monitor whenever the value changes .live() like function
[23:48:52] <lorfds> $.getJSON(url, function(data){
[23:48:59] <lorfds> do i have to call this function
[23:48:59] <paul_irish_> solidus-river: it'll turn the integer into a string. its fine
[23:49:04] <lorfds> or does it run automaticaly
[23:49:21] <paul_irish_> bapi_: you can use Object.watch() but it doesnt have oldIE support
[23:49:48] <paul_irish_> lorfds: it runs when the url is succesfully retrieved
[23:50:18] <lorfds> ok... so the $.whatever will make it load...I dont have to put it in document ready or anything like that
[23:51:22] <paul_irish_> in this case no
[23:51:29] <paul_irish_> you dont need the DOM to be complete before you load the json i guess
[23:51:37] <paul_irish_> you can do it whenever
[23:53:15] <rgr> he does if the ajax call acceses the dom
[23:53:50] <rgr> oh, no sorry, its not an async ajax call.
