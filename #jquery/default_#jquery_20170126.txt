[07:56:58] <dglambert> morning
[08:04:26] <jerit> ello
[08:07:45] <dglambert> hey jerit, aren't you in ##csharp too?
[08:08:14] <jerit> yup
[08:09:42] <dglambert> cheers
[08:10:01] <dglambert> thought I saw you talking the other day
[08:16:39] <jerit> I may have been :P I'm known to talk on occasion
[08:33:56] <ctmarco> Hello all i make validation when blur input field is red
[08:34:12] <ctmarco> how i can make when user writes something in input field it instantly become white?
[08:47:32] <ctmarco> Inactive room )=
[08:53:47] <xec> ctmarco: you can revalidate on input event
[08:54:38] <xec> instead of on blur. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/input
[08:56:36] <xec> if you need to support ie9 and older you can use keyup as well
[08:56:59] <ctmarco> xec how is it revalidate? :D
[08:57:22] <xec> same as validate, just done again :D
[08:57:40] <xec> i assume you validate the field on blur at the moment
[08:57:47] <xec> just validate on input instead
[08:59:01] <xec> blur happens only when you lose focus, input happens whenever the content changes (even if you use the mouse to paste something, which wont happen with keyup, for instance)
[09:07:34] <MikeD_> is there a way to determine if an object reference is a jquery object?
[09:11:11] <BillCriswell> You can use `instanceof jQuery`.
[09:11:22] <MikeD_> neat, thanks
[09:11:52] <BillCriswell> No problem

[12:05:41] <kingfisher64> would anyone be able to advise me on how to add a scroll down to  menu link - but from a different page? http://joomla.stackexchange.com/questions/18850/scroll-to-from-separate-joomla-page was my full question
[12:05:56] <kingfisher64> with http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9652944/jquery-scroll-to-id-from-different-page being the closest I found but not joomla related
[12:19:13] <Jon30> hey guys, WP saves some of their data using this kinda format: "a:3:{s:7:"address";s:45:"253 S Bay Rd, Port Severn, ON L0K 1S0, Canada";s:3:"lat";s:17:"44.85440853421251";s:3:"lng";s:17:"-79.7772216796875";}"
[12:19:20] <Jon30> what's the best way to parse it with jquery?
[12:19:42] <robertmaxrees> i wouldn't use jquery to parse that.
[12:20:00] <robertmaxrees> check to see if WP has a way to convert that into JSON.
[12:20:00] <Jon30> robertmaxrees: what would you use?
[12:20:25] <robertmaxrees> and/or PHP
[13:39:47] <Uhkis> Jon30: you want something like json_encode(unserialize($that_monster))
[13:40:25] <Jon30> Uhkis: that's php. I was looking for JS solution..  I ended up using this: http://locutus.io/php/var/unserialize/
[13:40:45] <robertmaxrees> why not do it server-side?
[13:43:48] <robertmaxrees> (shrug) #welp
[13:45:16] <hlve> (shrug) #halpmeiprefermakingthingshard
[13:45:17] <hlve> :)
[14:13:09] <Vooloo> is it possible to add an element, such as a button by xpath? I can't figure it out. I tried using append on a document.evaluate
[14:13:35] <hlve> why not find a selector using native JS?
[14:14:36] <Vooloo> I can find it fine and read xpath content with .singleNodeValue.textContent
[14:15:45] <Vooloo> but how do I add content?
[14:17:50] <Vooloo> ah I got it now, I only need to use .singleNodeValue
[14:32:34] <robertmaxrees> any particular reason you need to use xpath?
[14:51:17] <robertmaxrees> boom
[14:53:35] <Uhkis> bang
[15:50:30] <bjsnider> i have a form, and all the server-side and jquery is working, but there's one detail i'm wondering about. when an update using ajax is carried out, currently the page is not refreshed, and thus the db query that shows the status of the table being edited is not up to date. i could handle that by reloading the page using header/location in the action code, or perhaps there's a way jquery can re-run the query and then reload the data into the fo
[15:50:32] <bjsnider> r page?
[15:53:10] <robertmaxrees> the php side could return whatever data needs to be updated and you can handle that there.
[15:56:47] <bjsnider> ping it back as json?
[17:31:16] <printForever> $('body').on("scroll", function() {
[17:31:24] <printForever> why is this not firing?
[17:31:42] <printForever> the body is always moving
[17:32:35] <printForever> I've also tried window
[17:32:42] <taplar> are you sure some other element on the page isn't scrolling?
[17:32:45] <printForever> and a custom ID connected to a wrapper div
[17:32:55] <printForever> hey taplar!! :)
[17:33:05] <printForever> besides the issue, I wanted to say hi to you
[17:33:11] <taplar> yo
[17:33:20] <printForever> I've came here for support so many times, you've helped me so much
[17:33:40] <taplar> good deal
[17:33:49] <printForever> I'm sincerely grateful for every single line of text
[17:34:42] <printForever> yeah, I'm sure... the body is extending through the viewport height, its 3-4x taller than the browser viewport, so it has to be scrollable (there is a scroll bar and the page scrolls nicely)
[17:35:02] <taplar> can you share the page?
[17:35:49] <printForever> syre
[17:35:57] <printForever> uh... not really..
[17:35:58] <printForever> crap
[17:36:32] <printForever> hmmm...
[17:37:27] <printForever> I've changed it to window
[17:39:27] <printForever> it works now
[17:39:38] <printForever> taplar, thanks for just picking up and writing few lines
[17:39:47] <taplar> heh, i didn't do anything
[17:40:01] <printForever> I really hope you and your's have a great year... life...
[17:40:05] <printForever> no... you did
[17:40:18] <printForever> sometimes all people need is to write the issue down
[17:40:26] <taplar> oh sure
[17:41:13] <printForever> thanks!
[18:40:31] <phelix> So say I need to grab something from a json return like data.places but depending on what options they end up being it could be data.airports or data.hotels Could I set that as a variable?
[18:42:45] <phelix> sometimes data could return places: { } or sometimes it could be hotels: {}
[18:43:03] <phelix> depending on what data is sent it will return different things. if this makes sense.
[18:44:11] <robertmaxrees> hotels[someVarThatIsAString]
[18:44:15] <robertmaxrees> or whatever
[18:44:18] <robertmaxrees> data[someVar]
[18:44:42] <phelix> but wouldn't I need the period. because to access it normally it would be data.places or data.hotels etc.
[18:45:15] <robertmaxrees> data['hotels'] is the exact same as data.hotels
[18:45:22] <phelix> ahh ok thanks
[21:58:35] <lerha> Does anyone here know or can point me to the right direction about what kind of scripts would I need to create a function similar to what pepperfilter offers, where there is an image, you edit the text, and download as an image.
[22:11:25] <Stragler> Hello I have a problem that someone might be able to help me with. I have some divs that all thave their own divs that drop down with .slideDown() but I am confused how I should select the button and divs that corrrespond to each other. I have many of these and some more might come, so I don’t want to hard code “button1” “dropdown1”, “button2” “dropdown2” etc..

[22:42:20] <lorfds> i have an object for each td in this tr
[22:42:37] <lorfds> i want to extract the href from the link in the first td

[22:44:46] <lorfds> is what im trying
[22:44:48] <lorfds> but it no worky

[23:05:35] <Audlex> is there a way to force text into the bottom left info box that shows up when you hover a link?
[23:16:47] <snover> Audlex: no
[23:20:06] <Audlex> good to know. cheers.
[23:39:04] <epalm> when running $.post with an absolute path on an https page loaded, it seems to use http to make the ajax call https://jsfiddle.net/3k8oxmrr/
[23:39:11] <epalm> anyone know why that might be?
[23:39:49] <snover> first guess is a <base> tag
[23:42:18] <epalm> snover: i'll google for <base> tags but
[23:42:20] <epalm> what do you mean?
[23:42:47] <snover> “The HTML <base> element specifies the base URL to use for all relative URLs contained within a document.”
[23:43:12] <epalm> i'm starting the url with a slash, doesn't that make it an absolute url?
[23:43:24] <epalm> ie. start from the root of the current domain
[23:43:47] <snover> no, an absolute url is a complete url. what you have there is a domain-relative url
[23:45:18] <epalm> ok.  i guess the reason i'm confused is because an anchor like <a href="/path/to/resource">link</a> on a page like https://example.com will link to https://example.com/path/to/resource, so i expected jquery to act the same way
[23:45:43] <epalm> instead, jquery seems to be posting to http://example.com/path/to/resource
[23:46:59] <snover> that is not true for a page with a <base> tag
[23:47:16] <snover> my second guess is your server is trying to downgrade the connection with a redirect to insecure url
[23:57:52] <mindpattern> hey guys. if i load some remote content with $(element).load(); and that loaded content has some javascript in it, will it run that script after the element is loaded and is this reliable?
