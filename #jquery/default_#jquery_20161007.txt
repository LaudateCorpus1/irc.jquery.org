[03:26:09] <nindustries> Hi, can I assume $.ajax() will follow redirects and process Set-Cookie responses ?
[03:39:04] <Cork> nindustries: $.ajax uses XMLHttpRequest
[03:39:15] <Cork> nindustries: and xhr doesn't even expose redirects to js
[03:39:25] <Cork> so yes it follows redirects
[03:39:42] <Cork> set cookie depends on browser settings (again not controlled by js)
[03:43:10] <nindustries> hm.
[03:43:25] <nindustries> Because we have a thingy where it works in IE, but not in FF or Chrome..
[03:43:51] <Cork> is it cross domain?
[03:45:31] <nindustries> yez
[03:45:41] <Cork> there is your problem then
[03:46:03] <Cork> ie uses XDomain and standard browsers use cors
[03:46:29] <Cork> and both chrome and firefox has a browser setting to not allow cookies from cross domain requests
[03:46:57] <nindustries> hm, interesting
[03:47:27] <Cork> (and this is why you should never test first in ie, as it has a ton of none standard behaviors)
[03:47:50] <nindustries> Yeah, we tested in chrome
[03:48:33] <nindustries> So I should use sendCredentials then ?
[03:48:39] <nindustries> withCredentials *
[03:49:00] <Cork> depends on what you need to do
[03:49:26] <Cork> if you need a cookie you have to make a page redirect to let the cookie be set by that domain
[03:49:49] <nindustries> We have a wiki where there runs a Javascript thingy that GETs to a couple of websites. Those websites will redirect with a Set-Cookie before going to the applicable page
[03:49:54] <Cork> if you can make it without the cookie you can send the credentials with other methods
[03:49:59] <nindustries> atm: in IE, works. In Chrome and FF: infinite redirects
[03:50:25] <Cork> nindustries: also for standard browser the server has to set a cors header
[03:50:36] <Cork> or the response will be blocked
[03:50:53] <nindustries> Yeah, it does
[03:52:24] <Cork> and the withCredential doesn't work if the setting i talked about is set
[03:52:47] <nindustries> How do you mean?
[03:53:10] <Cork> if the browser blocks third party cookies withCredentials won't make any difference
[03:53:33] <Cork> and by default most modern browser block it unless there is already a cookie for that domain
[03:53:43] <nindustries> darn it.
[03:53:47] <Cork> (and is why i talked about the redirect)
[03:53:52] <nindustries> So I have to set a 5 sec cookie for all domains
[03:54:27] <Cork> the simplest solution might be to modify the wiki server to allow a solution that isn't cookie based
[03:54:59] <Cork> like a long key you generate for each user "session"
[03:55:09] <Cork> and sync from the server where they login to the wiki server
[03:55:13] <Cork> (though a backend api)
[04:05:08] <nindustries> Alright, thanks
[04:05:38] <nindustries> Another question; I have a very expensive operation I need to run in JS, what's the best way to do this?
[04:07:55] <nindustries> Atm its blocking the whole page
[04:08:12] <nindustries> It's a single function
[04:28:36] <Cork> nindustries: you might want to have a look at WebWorkers
[04:28:48] <Cork> nindustries: it isn't supported in all browsers though
[04:28:55] <nindustries> darn it
[04:29:05] <nindustries> why isnt there new Thread(function()) ? :P
[04:29:14] <Cork> nindustries: that is what webworkers is
[04:29:21] <Cork> *are
[04:29:33] <Cork> nindustries: alternatively you can break up the code in smaller parts and run them in a setTimeout loop
[04:29:45] <Cork> that way you give breeding room for the browser to update the page
[04:30:00] <Cork> you don't need any delay for the timer just setTimeout(nextLoop);
[04:42:55] <phunkren_> Hi. Is there any way to have jquery validator validate the email address after they have tabbed out of it, rather than after the first keystroke?
[04:43:08] <phunkren_> https://jqueryvalidation.org/email-method/
[04:43:38] <phunkren_> Strange because in that example the validation doesn't occur until the validate button is pressed
[04:44:07] <phunkren_> Ah, it has the desired result. It doesn't validate until I deselect the field
[05:27:49] <phunkren_> Anyone know how I can use jquery to determine whether a form field has been deselected?

[08:34:14] <TECFALL> I have had something come up numerous times now. When using .click to do an action. How do you prevent double click? I have tried disabling the button or setting a variable, but if the user double clicks fast enough it still performs the action.
[08:34:19] <TECFALL> How does anyone prevent this?
[08:40:29] <Ediz> Hello, I am making a post ajax call to a php file which returns 45 Objects after JSON.parse but when I use jquery .each on it to loop through them my alert within that loop only triggers once. here is the code. http://jsbin.com/subanutude/edit?html,css,js,output
[08:41:11] <AdamPDotty> tecfall: doubleclick is not click. Usually the difference is in mouse settings.
[08:47:13] <user_corrupt> is there an easy way to convert the following into a 1 or 0 instead of true or false? objectiveCheckBoxState = $('#objective-checkbox').prop("checked");
[08:48:40] <AdamPDotty> probably .is(':checked')
[08:49:38] <AdamPDotty> Ediz: Hard to say without the json and the output.
[08:52:52] <user_corrupt> objectiveCheckBoxState = $('#objective-checkbox').prop("checked") ? 1 : 0;
[08:52:54] <user_corrupt> works
[08:52:56] <ZoderUck> u hello, somebody here with experience with html email with inline or embedded styles?
[08:53:51] <jnoob22> I'm trying to get a td element to show as bold while hovering over a button in the same row -> https://jsfiddle.net/ for some reason this isn't working... im sure im doing something wrong here
[08:54:41] <jnoob22> any ideas?
[08:54:54] <Uhkis> jnoob22: press update first so we actually get the link
[08:55:13] <AdamPDotty> might help
[08:55:58] <jnoob22> heh that would, wouldn't it? ;-) https://jsfiddle.net/7sxrr3o1/
[08:58:04] <Uhkis> jnoob22: you're missing # before the td-element
[08:58:31] <AdamPDotty> hmm, is hover even an event? Do not you mean "mouseover"?
[08:58:38] <jnoob22> Uhkis, right but it still doesn't work
[08:58:43] <jnoob22> ill try mouseover
[08:59:03] <jnoob22> that doesn't work either
[08:59:20] <jnoob22> https://jsfiddle.net/7sxrr3o1/1/
[09:00:07] <jnoob22> hmm neither does focus
[09:00:32] <Uhkis> https://jsfiddle.net/7sxrr3o1/2/
[09:00:41] <Uhkis> proper html works
[09:02:36] <AdamPDotty> hehe
[09:03:06] <AdamPDotty> I had it down to $('td').css('color', 'red') and still nothing
[09:55:15] <user_corrupt> the following always returns "1", even when ".button.tense" does not also have a class of "selected". Suggestions?   		tenseSelected = $(".button.tense.selected") ? 1 : 0;
[09:57:37] <Cork> user_corrupt: you need .length > 0
[09:57:47] <Cork> $() returns an object not a boolean
[09:57:57] <Cork> so it is always truety

[11:12:19] <ExeciN> hi, how can I properly modify the text element of lets say a p element?
[11:12:26] <ExeciN> I want to avoid $("p").html(definitelyNotABeaconJSScript);
[11:12:54] <taplar> thems how you do it
[11:13:04] <taplar> unless you want to go to the Element and use innerHTML
[11:13:27] <zero_point> Where i can learning jquery?
[11:13:33] <taplar> learn.jquery.com
[11:13:38] <ExeciN> yeah but I'm afraid if somehow someone injects js on my page
[11:13:51] <taplar> you can't stop that
[11:13:57] <taplar> that's out of your control
[11:14:25] <taplar> greasemonkey, tampermonkey, that's their whole deal
[11:16:15] <ExeciN> taplar: the way I'm thinking it is like $("p").html(comment); but comment has stuff like <script>//evil beacon stuff</script>
[11:16:33] <taplar> right, but you can't prevent that
[11:16:43] <taplar> and it would only be for the user that did that to themselves so...
[11:16:53] <decx> use text() instead then
[11:17:14] <ExeciN> hmm... what if I escape '<' and '>'?
[11:17:23] <taplar> text() is more secure
[11:17:29] <taplar> if your rendering stuff from the server
[11:17:38] <taplar> that you do not want to be evaluates
[11:17:41] <taplar> evaluated
[11:18:10] <taplar> i thought the question was preventing users from injecting scripts though, not cleaning data from the server
[11:18:26] <ExeciN> ah yeah, text seems to be escaping some chars
[12:04:22] <ExeciN> I'm trying this $("#example").text("test\ning"); but instead of test<br>ing, test ing is generated. what am I doing wrong?
[12:04:43] <taplar> nothing, text doesn't convert to html
[12:04:50] <robertmaxrees> ^
[12:04:58] <taplar> it just creates a text node rather than creating Elements
[12:06:40] <ExeciN> how can I insert a <br> at the end of #example? I tried $("#example").html.append("<br>"); but html doesn't have an append method
[12:07:20] <robertmaxrees> $(‘#example’).append(‘<br>’);
[12:08:00] <robertmaxrees> but i would avoid using <br> in general.
[12:18:42] <ExeciN> I'm doing this: var t = "te<br>st"; var i = "i<br>ng"; $("#example").text(t); $("#example").append("<br>"); $("#example").append(i); How do I escape the 3rd <br> ?
[12:19:23] <taplar> easiest way would be to do it manually
[12:19:53] <taplar> &lt;br&gt;
[12:20:28] <taplar> or, hmm, one sec
[12:21:12] <taplar> $('#example').append(document.createTextNode('<br>));
[12:21:15] <taplar> $('#example').append(document.createTextNode('<br>'));
[12:22:54] <ExeciN> text node isn't interpreted as html, right?
[12:23:12] <taplar> nope
[12:24:09] <ExeciN> great, thanks
[12:26:29] <taplar> i guess it's not a large use case but I think an appendText() method could be cool
[12:30:35] <decx> textNode br what?
[12:30:50] <taplar> hmm?
[12:32:09] <decx> textNode br what?
[12:33:02] <decx> wait the br should be a string
[12:33:05] <decx> what²
[12:33:29] <taplar> he's wanting to append '<br>' and it display as text rather than be interpreted
[12:33:50] <decx> pretty sure "what" is the appropriate response tho
[12:33:57] <taplar> *shrug*
[12:46:42] <robertmaxrees> i am just the universe’s punching bag at this point.
[12:52:09] <taplar> lol, damn dude
[12:52:18] <taplar> not a friendly friday i take it?
[12:52:24] <robertmaxrees> more house stuff.
[12:52:25] <robertmaxrees> house came back positive for asbestos.
[12:52:31] <taplar> ouch
[12:52:41] <robertmaxrees> which pushes things out even further.
[12:53:11] <robertmaxrees> i won’t be in my house few a few months at this point.
[12:53:50] <taplar> staying with family or find some short term apartments?
[12:54:52] <robertmaxrees> Stayed with family for a week.  Insurance was finally able to put us up in a hotel room, but only until Tuesday.  They’ll find us the next one soon.  we’re also looking for a rental house.
[12:56:15] <taplar> that good.  i know where i used to rent before my last rent place, there was an apartment complex next to us that rented by the month or even the week iirc.  not the best neighborhood, but ya know
[12:56:32] <robertmaxrees> yeah.
[12:56:54] <robertmaxrees> since we’re in a college town there’s plenty of stuff available on month-to-month agreements.
[12:57:04] <decx> see the positive, without that waterdamage you'd have lived in an asbestos house without knowing it
[12:57:21] <robertmaxrees> insurance company actually has another company that finds us housing.  we also don’t pay a dime.
[12:57:40] <robertmaxrees> decx ‘cept living in it is fine so long as you don’t disturb any of it.
[12:57:48] <robertmaxrees> this is all the insulation.  so it’s all sealed in the walls.
[12:57:59] <taplar> heh, they're like we're going to be footing the bill for you so we decide where you stay
[12:58:06] <decx> i'm just spinning here
[12:58:14] <robertmaxrees> actually, that’s not the case at all - we decide where we want to go.
[12:58:29] <taplar> hmm
[12:58:48] <robertmaxrees> they’re going to put us up in a comperable place.  so we’ll have similarly sized house with a similar yard, etc.
[12:59:05] <robertmaxrees> decx yeah, just hard to stay positive at this point.
[12:59:24] <taplar> anything that is stressful sux after a bit
[12:59:38] <robertmaxrees> exactly.  and there’s just no letting up with any of it so far.
[12:59:46] <robertmaxrees> things just keep getting worse.
[12:59:57] <robertmaxrees> and after the two years we’ve had?  super stressful.
[13:48:43] <plamb__> hi dudes
[13:48:49] <plamb__> any help with this would be appreciated
[13:48:51] <plamb__> https://jsfiddle.net/yge2yjzp/6/
[13:49:00] <robertmaxrees> what’s your question?
[13:49:30] <plamb__> trying to select by
[13:49:41] <plamb__> going back two siblings, grabbing children and getting the value of an input
[13:49:44] <plamb__> its not work
[13:49:45] <plamb__> ing
[13:50:11] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/prevall/ -> “Get all preceding siblings [...]”
[13:50:20] <plamb__> yes
[13:50:23] <plamb__> that was my thought
[13:50:23] <robertmaxrees> .fa-trash doesn’t have any siblings.
[13:50:39] <plamb__> view-block and edit-block arent siblings?
[13:50:54] <plamb__> oh my html is off
[13:50:59] <robertmaxrees> not of .fa-trash....
[13:51:11] <robertmaxrees> also, .children takes a selector.
[13:51:13] <plamb__> https://jsfiddle.net/yge2yjzp/7/
[13:51:23] <plamb__> oh
[13:51:24] <plamb__> right
[13:51:24] <robertmaxrees> .children("itemidEdit") is looking for <itemidEdit>
[13:51:25] <plamb__> hmm
[13:51:56] <plamb__> there we go
[13:51:57] <plamb__> https://jsfiddle.net/yge2yjzp/8/
[13:52:08] <robertmaxrees> you could fix your markup to make this much easier.
[13:52:19] <plamb__> its a minimal example
[13:52:23] <plamb__> the actually markup is more complex
[13:52:36] <robertmaxrees> doesn’t change my suggestion.
[13:52:46] <robertmaxrees> relying on sibling relationships is generally a poor idea.
[13:53:17] <plamb__> :(
[13:53:34] <plamb__> how would you do it
[13:53:39] <plamb__> give itemidEdit a class
[13:54:05] <robertmaxrees> would .edit-elements only every contain a pair of .edit-block and .view-block?
[13:54:25] <plamb__> technically the an <i> and those two spans
[13:54:33] <plamb__> -the
[13:54:43] <robertmaxrees> right - so only those three elements?  not multiple edit-blocks?
[13:54:45] <robertmaxrees> etc?
[13:55:03] <plamb__> only in other edit-elements
[13:55:09] <plamb__> but in a single one
[13:55:12] <plamb__> only 1 edit block
[13:55:18] <robertmaxrees> yeah okay.
[13:55:35] <robertmaxrees> so instead of using sibling relationships, get the parent .edit-elements and then just .find() all the stuff you want.
[13:56:15] <plamb__> like this?
[13:56:16] <plamb__> https://jsfiddle.net/yge2yjzp/10/
[13:56:32] <robertmaxrees> i’d use .closest() instead.
[13:56:38] <robertmaxrees> but that’s the basic idea.
[13:56:46] <plamb__> is closest faster or something
[13:56:50] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/yge2yjzp/12/
[13:57:07] <robertmaxrees> it stops looking when it finds the first ancestor that matches.
[13:57:29] <robertmaxrees> and decouples your html from your js some more.
[13:57:36] <plamb__> i see
[13:57:38] <plamb__> cool
[13:57:39] <robertmaxrees> .parent() assumes some things about your markup that you may change.
[14:00:48] <plamb__> so if i do an ajax call in that click event
[14:00:55] <plamb__> i.e. the clicking of the trash icon
[14:01:06] <plamb__> .ajax().done(...)
[14:01:15] <plamb__> does 'this' still refer to the trashcan
[14:01:18] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[14:01:19] <plamb__> in the .done()
[14:01:20] <plamb__> okay
[14:02:26] <plamb__> is there a way to select based on two conditions or would you use a .has
[14:02:35] <robertmaxrees> what do you mean?
[14:02:40] <robertmaxrees> depends on the conditions.
[14:02:54] <plamb__> like $('input[value=22] & input[name=itemID]')
[14:03:02] <robertmaxrees> i’d use .filter()
[14:03:05] <robertmaxrees> personally.
[14:03:07] <robertmaxrees> with a function.
[14:03:18] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, you could do  $('input[value=22][name=itemID]')
[14:03:30] <plamb__> on you can chain them like that huh
[14:03:32] <plamb__> oh*
[14:03:40] <robertmaxrees> just like in CSS>
[14:04:10] <taplar> dunno why people don't like to give inputs classes
[14:04:19] <robertmaxrees> ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
[14:04:26] <plamb__> haha
[14:04:33] <robertmaxrees> seriously though.
[14:04:38] <robertmaxrees> select on ids and attributes.
[14:04:42] <robertmaxrees> *class.
[14:04:47] <robertmaxrees> not on attributes.
[14:04:50] <plamb__> in the css/html channels they would murder me for putting extra classes/ids on things
[14:04:54] <plamb__> in here they murder me for not
[14:05:07] <MikeD_> welcome to jquery
[14:05:09] <taplar> *shrug* a class isn't a css class, it's just a class
[14:05:09] <robertmaxrees> there’s a balance to strike.
[14:05:21] <taplar> it's a grouping mechanism
[14:05:38] <plamb__> oh wait
[14:05:52] <plamb__> robertmaxrees: i could save 'this' into a var then use it in the .done() right
[14:05:55] <MikeD_> the extreme is making your own tag system by giving everything its own class
[14:06:07] <robertmaxrees> plamb__ sure.
[14:06:11] <robertmaxrees> i’d favor .then() these days, but yeah.
[14:06:15] <robertmaxrees> that would work.
[14:06:50] <plamb__> just skips one more search of the DOM
[14:07:35] <robertmaxrees> sure.
[14:07:53] <plamb__> this look right?
[14:07:54] <plamb__> http://pastebin.com/2g3m0FD9
[14:10:20] <robertmaxrees> https://bpaste.net/show/3f9f3f4ef5c6
[14:10:23] <robertmaxrees> clean up dat formatting yo.
[14:10:57] <plamb__> yeah i should really use sublime or something instead of a text file
[14:12:42] <MikeD_> have you ever seen autocomplete fail to filter if the value being supplied exactly matches the last selection?
[14:21:50] <plamb__> is the .val() of a textarea actually the text inside it
[14:22:00] <taplar> yes
[14:22:02] <robertmaxrees> a quick jsfiddle would tell you.
[14:23:15] <plamb__> how would you test for $(this) being a textarea e.g.
[14:23:17] <plamb__> if ($(this) != 'textarea')
[14:23:33] <robertmaxrees> .is(‘textarea’)
[14:23:44] <plamb__> ahh
[14:23:44] <robertmaxrees> if (!$(this).is(‘textarea’)) {}
[14:25:09] <taplar> this.type === 'textarea' heh
[14:25:13] <robertmaxrees> or that.
[14:25:16] <taplar> err, maybe
[14:25:22] <taplar> that's tagName actually
[14:25:40] <taplar> this.tagName === 'textarea'
[14:33:49] <plamb__> can you pass a class name to hasClass without putting a period in front of it
[14:34:01] <robertmaxrees> https://api.jquery.com/hasclass/
[14:34:05] <plamb__> looking at that
[14:34:10] <robertmaxrees> first example use:
[14:34:11] <robertmaxrees> $( "#mydiv" ).hasClass( "foo" )
[14:34:19] <robertmaxrees> that’s how you’re supposed to use it.
[14:34:23] <plamb__> i see
[14:34:26] <taplar> it's not a selector
[14:34:55] <plamb__> oh
[14:35:00] <plamb__> good point
[14:35:09] <taplar> ;)
[14:35:09] <robertmaxrees> lol
[14:35:39] <plamb__> tfw nested looping
[14:35:50] <robertmaxrees> ew.
[14:36:12] <taplar> tfw?
[14:36:20] <robertmaxrees> that feeling when
[14:36:26] <robertmaxrees> and you should refactor to remove that.
[14:36:27] <taplar> mmm
[14:36:59] <robertmaxrees> oh fuck it’s already 11:35
[14:37:06] <plamb__> any idea on how to re factor this
[14:37:07] <plamb__> http://pastebin.com/eHGJA6uD
[14:37:18] <robertmaxrees> fwiw don’t use pastebin.
[14:37:19] <plamb__> oh maybe i could
[14:37:20] <robertmaxrees> it’s gross.
[14:37:23] <taplar> this.name
[14:37:26] <taplar> for starters
[14:37:34] <robertmaxrees> avoid .attr() as mucha s you can.
[14:37:42] <plamb__> $("'.'+jsonProp")
[14:37:45] <plamb__> to select the class
[14:38:02] <taplar> children().filter('.'+ className)
[14:38:04] <robertmaxrees> and start using semicolons and get your formatting cleaned up.
[14:38:04] <plamb__> that would remove the loop
[14:38:34] <plamb__> i see taplar
[14:38:39] <plamb__> that doesnt need to have quotes around it?
[14:38:45] <taplar> children().filter('.'+ className).val(newVal)
[14:39:08] <taplar> jsonProp instead of className is your variable
[14:39:20] <plamb__> right but typically you pass classes like
[14:39:22] <plamb__> '.class'
[14:39:31] <taplar> right, but your value doesn't have the leading dot, right?
[14:39:32] <plamb__> when you create a string like that you dont have too?
[14:39:36] <plamb__> correct
[14:39:40] <taplar> so...
[14:39:49] <taplar> filter(selector)
[14:39:50] <plamb__> i just figured it'd be
[14:39:55] <taplar> filter(selector||function)
[14:40:01] <plamb__> filter("'.'+className")
[14:40:20] <taplar> huh?
[14:40:28] <robertmaxrees> wat
[14:40:41] <robertmaxrees> js 101
[14:40:47] <robertmaxrees> filter(‘.’ + className);
[14:40:56] <plamb__> :(
[14:42:27] <taplar> that doesn't even make sense.  filter("'.'+className")   that is a literal string with the surrounding "".
[14:42:33] <robertmaxrees> right.
[14:43:08] <taplar> plamb__:  you get that right?
[14:43:23] <plamb__> i suppose
[14:43:31] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[14:43:35] <robertmaxrees> this is kind of foundational stuff :)
[14:43:35] <taplar> lol, be firm
[14:43:39] <taplar> " 1 * 3 "
[14:43:41] <robertmaxrees> what about it is confusing?
[14:43:42] <taplar> what would that do?
[14:43:54] <plamb__> can i pass classes like $(.edit-block)
[14:43:57] <plamb__> then?
[14:43:59] <robertmaxrees> no.
[14:44:03] <robertmaxrees> because you need a string.
[14:44:08] <plamb__> and not $('.edit-block')
[14:44:09] <robertmaxrees> $(‘.edit-block’)
[14:44:19] <plamb__> thats why its confusing
[14:44:19] <robertmaxrees> $(‘.’ + someVar) will make a string for you.
[14:44:22] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[14:44:27] <robertmaxrees> do you know how vars in JS work?
[14:44:36] <taplar> dang, your beating me to it
[14:44:49] <plamb__> ah i guess that makes sense
[14:47:40] <robertmaxrees> so doing ("'.'+className") means you want to select ‘.’+classname - like, that’s the actual string.
[14:47:43] <robertmaxrees> which doesn’t make any sense.
[14:47:49] <plamb__> right
[14:48:31] <plamb__> hadnt connected that the point of $( ) is to pass actual strings
[14:48:40] <taplar> it's not
[14:48:42] <plamb__> and it wasnt just some syntax thing that classnames were in quotes
[14:48:53] <taplar> it will accept strings, but you can give it other things too
[14:48:57] <taplar> Elements, functions, etc
[14:49:07] <taplar> just depends
[14:49:07] <robertmaxrees> taplar sure, but 9/10 you’re giving it strings.
[15:15:09] <robertmaxrees> hrmmm...
[15:37:21] <Azrael_-> hi
[15:37:30] <taplar> aloha
[15:37:40] <robertmaxrees> hullo
[15:37:41] <taplar> angel of death!
[15:38:37] <Uhkis> monarch to the kingdom of the dead!
[15:38:58] <Azrael_-> taplar: oh yeah
[15:39:13] <taplar> did you just koolaid man me?
[15:39:23] <Azrael_-> koolaid?
[15:39:27] <taplar> lol
[15:39:37] <Uhkis> infamous butcher
[15:40:12] <Uhkis> wait what? we aren't irc singing slayer?
[15:41:08] <Azrael_-> i want to display a small overly with a link next to the mouse when the user clicks on a link. in there the user can copy something. when the user clicks somewhere else the overly shall vanish. how can i accomplish the vanish part?
[15:41:26] <robertmaxrees> a modal.
[15:42:19] <robertmaxrees> instead of building it yourself, use something pre-built :)
[15:43:40] <Azrael_-> i know, i just have to find a way to style it as i want. and for me it looked like the modal-dialogs i found couldn't be customized that far
[15:43:53] <robertmaxrees> which ones are you looking at?
[15:44:03] <Azrael_-> https://jqueryui.com/dialog/#default
[15:45:06] <Azrael_-> i'm happy with every suggestion
[15:45:14] <robertmaxrees> errr, so you’re looking at one option.
[15:45:35] <robertmaxrees> so first off api.jqueryui.com/dialog/#theming
[15:45:37] <Azrael_-> i'm not that good with jquery :) fiddling everything together
[15:45:41] <robertmaxrees> you could customize quite a bit.
[15:45:47] <robertmaxrees> lots of CSS stuff you can do.
[15:46:00] <Azrael_-> thx
[15:46:47] <taplar> Azrael_-: are you using jquery ui in any other part of your app?
[15:46:57] <Azrael_-> iirc: yes
[15:47:14] <taplar> k, if not i was going to ask if you had looked at bootstrap
[15:47:23] <Azrael_-> i also use bootstrap
[15:48:02] <taplar> well bootstrap also has popovers and such
[15:48:13] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[15:48:14] <robertmaxrees> mixing bootstrap and jqui is a recipe for pain
[15:48:14] <robertmaxrees> but yeah.
[15:48:14] <robertmaxrees> either/or would work.
[15:48:52] <tomasm-> anyone know of a decent ajax validation plugin that works nicely with bootstrap? i need to do some unique record checking instantly in my db, server-side validation isnt fast enough
[15:49:07] <robertmaxrees> “ajax validation plugin”?
[15:49:49] <taplar> that's kinda a smell
[15:49:56] <taplar> you're going to want backend validation in any case
[15:49:56] <robertmaxrees> yeah something there seems weird.,
[15:50:11] <robertmaxrees> right.  you could build that very easily yourself.
[15:50:47] <tomasm-> robertmaxrees, form validation using ajax. hence #jquery
[15:51:10] <robertmaxrees> i wasn’t question why you’re in this channel.
[15:51:11] <robertmaxrees> but ok.
[15:51:21] <taplar> lol, you don't use ajax to validate forms...
[15:51:23] <robertmaxrees> jquery validate can support ajax-based stuff.
[15:51:24] <tomasm-> taplar, well it gets processed with the backend. thats why i said AJAX and not javascript alone.
[15:51:55] <tomasm-> taplar, i do when i need to check a backend database for unique records
[15:52:09] <robertmaxrees> i wouldn’t use a full validation lib for that tbqh.
[15:52:12] <Azrael_-> taplar: bootstrap looks great, just one caveat: i only see the option to leave the popover open all the time (until the user clicks the link again) and the "dismiss on next click". i need the user to be able to copy text from the popover. currently can't see how to put this together. mind to give me anothe rhint?
[15:52:15] <robertmaxrees> you could build that out yourself pretty easil.
[15:52:34] <robertmaxrees> Azrael_- you want tooltips or modals?
[15:52:56] <taplar> tomasm-: so you're wanting to send the data to the server, validate uniqueness, and return the truth of the check, essentially?
[15:53:01] <Azrael_-> at best i'd like to have tooltips but the user has to be able to copy a link from the tooltip
[15:53:08] <tomasm-> robertmaxrees, yeah well styling error messages, showing a 'checking' icon ,etc
[15:53:26] <robertmaxrees> tomasm- sure - i’d still build that out myself.
[15:53:56] <tomasm-> taplar, pretty much, but the big part is the user feedback, showing a "checking..." message plus a response/error message if taken. and disabling the form until it passes
[15:54:08] <robertmaxrees> right, you can easily build that yourself.
[15:54:11] <taplar> ^^^
[15:54:14] <tomasm-> robertmaxrees, you keep saying that
[15:54:18] <robertmaxrees> yep :)
[15:54:21] <robertmaxrees> and you keep ignoring it.
[15:54:33] <tomasm-> robertmaxrees, no im explaining myself
[15:54:40] <robertmaxrees> and i’m stiull syaing the same thing.
[15:54:43] <robertmaxrees> my answer won’t change.
[15:54:55] <tomasm-> robertmaxrees, say it 10 more times, maybe i'll consider it
[15:55:00] <robertmaxrees> dude
[15:55:04] <robertmaxrees> no reason to be rude about it.
[15:55:08] <robertmaxrees> you could try jquery validate but that seems pretty heavy handed for your needs.
[15:55:33] <taplar> would you use that?  he's wanting backend validation, not front end
[15:55:52] <robertmaxrees> jquery validate can handle the wiring and ajax bits, but I would just build out something myself for that.
[15:56:00] <taplar> huh, didn't know that
[15:57:06] <taplar> in any case i agree with robert.  it's a fairly small task to disable the form when you kick off the ajax, maybe throw up an overlay with a spinner or message, then when the ajax finishes hide the overlay and spinner, enable the form, and display whatever message(s)
[15:57:19] <robertmaxrees> ^
[16:15:30] <verax5> Yo any idea why this wont un-check the check boxed?
[16:15:33] <verax5> boxes*
[16:15:33] <verax5> http://pastebin.com/06bvauC6
[16:15:48] <robertmaxrees> use .prop
[16:15:51] <robertmaxrees> instead of .attr
[16:15:55] <robertmaxrees> and don’t use map for that.
[16:15:57] <robertmaxrees> use .each
[16:16:07] <verax5> i still havent figured what .map is for lol
[16:16:10] <verax5> thought it was like loop
[16:16:24] <robertmaxrees> it’s for getting an array of data.
[16:16:41] <robertmaxrees> so let’s say you want to take a bunch of info out of the page and map it into a different format.
[16:16:44] <robertmaxrees> that’s what map does.
[16:16:52] <robertmaxrees> you return the new data for each index out of it.
[16:17:17] <verax5> ohhhhhhhh
[16:17:20] <verax5> i see
[16:19:49] <verax5> hmm script still wont uncheck
[16:19:55] <robertmaxrees> make a jsfiddle.
[16:19:58] <robertmaxrees> show us.
[16:19:59] <robertmaxrees> :)
[16:19:59] <verax5> im doing this.prop('unchecked');
[16:20:03] <robertmaxrees> lol
[16:20:08] <robertmaxrees> .prop(‘checked’, false)
[16:20:12] <verax5> ohh
[16:20:28] <verax5> lol i just copied what they said here
[16:20:29] <verax5> http://api.jquery.com/prop/
[16:21:12] <robertmaxrees> literally nowhere does it have prop('unchecked');
[16:21:13] <taplar> why use map to uncheck checkboxes?
[16:21:23] <robertmaxrees> already told him not to ;
[16:21:27] <taplar> ah
[16:22:01] * taplar moses back to his unit tests
[16:23:25] <verax5> https://jsfiddle.net/ytdww7j2/
[16:23:40] <robertmaxrees> you wanted to uncheck it.
[16:23:48] <robertmaxrees> this.prop('checked', false);
[16:23:56] <verax5> oh yeah but just for sake of test
[16:24:00] <verax5> lemme test
[16:24:02] <verax5> agin
[16:24:05] <robertmaxrees> wat
[16:24:11] <taplar> 'this' would be an Element in the each
[16:24:19] <robertmaxrees> wat
[16:24:21] <robertmaxrees> you sure about that?
[16:24:29] <taplar> yep
[16:25:03] <robertmaxrees> “ More importantly, the callback is fired in the context of the current DOM element, so the keyword this refers to the element.”
[16:25:23] <taplar> the raw element, not a jQuery object, is what i was getting at
[16:25:26] <robertmaxrees> oh./
[16:25:26] <verax5> https://jsfiddle.net/ytdww7j2/1/
[16:25:27] <robertmaxrees> that.
[16:25:36] <robertmaxrees> verax5 youneed to do $(this)
[16:25:43] <robertmaxrees> $(this).prop('checked', false);
[16:25:43] <taplar> this.checked = false;
[16:25:48] <robertmaxrees> or that
[16:25:55] <verax5> could ya telll whats the diff between $(This)
[16:25:57] <verax5> and this
[16:25:58] <taplar> or don't even do the each
[16:26:06] <robertmaxrees> ‘this’ is just the raw DOM node.
[16:26:14] <robertmaxrees> $(this) is the jquery object for the node.
[16:26:24] <robertmaxrees> .prop() isn’t a method on raw dom nodes.
[16:27:46] <verax5> hm
[16:27:50] <verax5> so what should i do now?
[16:28:09] <robertmaxrees> what do you mean?
[16:28:14] <robertmaxrees> you have some options.
[16:30:45] <verax5> hm
[16:30:50] <verax5> oka
[16:31:12] <robertmaxrees> also: input[name=deleteUsers] will never select that input
[16:31:21] <robertmaxrees> i’d give the input a class to select on.
[16:38:20] <robertmaxrees> weeeeee
[16:54:21] <taplar> the ebb and flow of jquery
[16:59:12] <robertmaxrees> hahaha i remember that dude from yesterday
[16:59:20] <taplar> ?
[16:59:31] <robertmaxrees> the dude that couldn’t speak english but just kept talking.
[16:59:35] <robertmaxrees> and spamming the channel./
[16:59:36] <taplar> oh yeah
[16:59:49] <taplar> does eir unban people after 24hr?
[16:59:56] <robertmaxrees> by default yeah.
[17:03:57] <wolfravenous> Using code at this stackoverflow page here to implement dynamic selection boxes, I have some Rails experince but almost no js knowledge.  in Rails to allow the option to choose a blank(nil) selection I simply add :include_blank => "(select if none)" however this option is being filtered out by the js in this configuration, can anyone tell me how to keep from filtering out the blank option in this configuration?
[17:03:57] <wolfravenous> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14927430/convert-grouped-collection-select-to-simple-form-in-rails-dynamic-menu
[17:04:32] <robertmaxrees> wolfravenous you’ll get a lot more help if you show us what you’ve tried in plain JS instead of coffeescript :)
[17:04:47] <ngharo> whatever happened to b-ot (or was it bot-t)?
[17:04:52] <robertmaxrees> b-ot
[17:04:57] <robertmaxrees> and it’s up and doiwn.
[17:05:04] <robertmaxrees> i think the commands got hosed at some point.
[17:05:09] <ngharo> whose got the source?
[17:05:16] <robertmaxrees> gnarf maybe?
[17:05:27] <ngharo> that bot was gold a couple years ago
[17:05:31] <wolfravenous> robertmaxrees:  I haven’t tried any plain js, I just modified that coffeescript to fit my configuration
[17:06:07] <taplar> it's slightly concerning that you're trying to use something you're not familiar with, given that you will most likely be the one supporting it
[17:06:15] <robertmaxrees> ^
[17:06:29] <robertmaxrees> also: most of us don’t use coffeescript, so it’s hard to offer help.
[17:07:08] <wolfravenous> taplar:  I understand but I am only using it in one place, for dynamic select boxes and I am the only one that will ever use the application… I made an app to help me generate some reports.
[17:07:32] <taplar> 'dynamic select boxes' ?
[17:07:38] <robertmaxrees> heh.
[17:07:41] <robertmaxrees> make a jsfiddle maybe?
[17:09:10] <Azrael_-> i've got a clickevent on a button. how can i find an object on the same level based on e.target? i tried $(e.target).parent().find('.myclass')  but it is always empty. any hints?
[17:09:10] <wolfravenous> taplar:  yep,  I am using a dynamic select boxes, kinda like the (country, state) examples online, where when you choose the country, the jQuery script filters the states for just that country, except I am using for Subject and Units.
[17:09:29] <wolfravenous> taplar: I will make a gist.
[17:09:33] <robertmaxrees> Azrael_- show us in a fiddle what you’re trying to do.
[17:09:40] <taplar> so <select> elements that you are dynamically replacing the options of?
[17:09:40] <robertmaxrees> wolfravenous make a jsfiddle instead if you can.
[17:09:40] <Azrael_-> k
[17:10:17] <wolfravenous> robertmaxrees:  can you please explain jsfiddle?  I don’t know what that is?
[17:10:31] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/
[17:10:37] <robertmaxrees> a place to create working test cases :)
[17:10:43] <taplar> *small
[17:10:47] <robertmaxrees> ^^^
[17:11:02] <taplar> ( preferably )
[17:11:03] <wolfravenous> robertmaxrees: thanks
[17:11:06] <robertmaxrees> yep :)
[17:12:04] <taplar> mmm, i want another mt dew icee
[17:12:50] <robertmaxrees> i wanna play guitar hell of bad right now.
[17:13:59] <Azrael_-> how can i include jquery in jsfiddle?
[17:14:10] <robertmaxrees> see the gear icon next to the javascript box heading?
[17:15:01] <robertmaxrees> click that, then on the Frameworks & Extensions dropdown
[17:15:16] <Azrael_-> thx, found it
[17:16:47] <Azrael_-> https://jsfiddle.net/yocq2Lmj/2/ <-- ok, this works, gotta retry it in my system
[17:17:09] <Azrael_-> or can you hint a better solution?
[17:17:24] <robertmaxrees> sure - that wrapping <div>? give it a class.
[17:17:32] <robertmaxrees> then use .closest() instead of parent
[17:17:51] <taplar> Azrael_-: you mentioned before that it was a sibling?
[17:18:21] <taplar> or is that accurate?
[17:18:32] <Azrael_-> taplar: like you see in my fiddle it is on the same level as the button
[17:18:47] <taplar> are you familiar with the siblings() method?
[17:18:53] <Azrael_-> not yet
[17:18:57] <robertmaxrees> >.>
[17:19:00] <taplar> that's also an option
[17:21:26] <Azrael_-> https://jsfiddle.net/yocq2Lmj/3/ <-- yay, thx
[17:23:48] <taplar> robertmaxrees: what's your go to musical set choice currently?
[17:26:38] <wolfravenous> robertmaxrees:  taplar:  I created the jsfiddle, when I run the js fiddle the script doesn’t do what it does for me in a browser.  It doesn’t dynamically filter the second selection box, here is the fiddle:  https://jsfiddle.net/w2L2ec8y/
[17:27:40] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/w2L2ec8y/1/ gotta include jquery
[17:28:15] <wolfravenous> taplar:  thanks
[17:29:10] <robertmaxrees> aaand i found a house to rent.
[17:29:11] <robertmaxrees> thankfull.
[17:29:19] <taplar> sweet
[17:29:48] <wolfravenous> Okay so now he fiddle gives the expected behavior.  I just want to modifiy it so that that option (select if none) is always avaialble even after the jQuery filters the Units by Subject.
[17:30:36] <taplar> you could include that in your groups?
[17:31:05] <taplar> no logic change at that point, if i understand this
[17:31:15] <wolfravenous> I was hoping there is some way to alter the if/else conditionals of the coffescript to allow it to pass throught the filters.
[17:31:43] <robertmaxrees> so you want none ot be an option?
[17:32:26] <taplar> ugh, lack of {} and ; is killing me
[17:32:30] <wolfravenous> yes I would like none to be an optioin so that I can later pass a nil value into a report which just means no data will be in the report for that unit.
[17:32:31] <robertmaxrees> heh
[17:32:55] <robertmaxrees> so then kill off the conditional and just always run what’s in the iof.
[17:32:57] <robertmaxrees> *if
[17:33:52] <wolfravenous> robertmaxrees:  I don’t understand what you mean by killing the conditional?
[17:34:17] <robertmaxrees> so you basically always want to run $('#report_unit_id').html(options), right
[17:34:17] <robertmaxrees> ?
[17:34:30] <robertmaxrees> even if options is empty?
[17:35:08] <wolfravenous> I think so
[17:35:16] <robertmaxrees> think or know?
[17:36:11] <wolfravenous> I know the outcome I want not sure of the code?  I want to be able to select the Subject Biology, and still see the option in Unit (select if none)
[17:36:28] <robertmaxrees> oooh.
[17:36:32] <robertmaxrees> that’s what you mean.
[17:37:12] <robertmaxrees> coffeescript is so confusing.
[17:37:14] <wolfravenous> if you run the fiddle that option is there, but once you choose a Subject it get filtered out from the Unit selection because it isn’t a nested resource under all the subjects.
[17:37:22] <robertmaxrees> correct.
[17:37:25] <robertmaxrees> i see that and am clear now :)
[17:37:45] <taplar> is this it? https://jsfiddle.net/w2L2ec8y/4/
[17:38:00] <wolfravenous> I just want to let it pass throught that coffeescript filter so all the other filtering happens but it just passes through.
[17:38:06] <wolfravenous> taplar: let me look
[17:38:19] <robertmaxrees> that filter isn’t coffeescript btw.
[17:38:24] <taplar> dunno if that is the best approach
[17:38:39] <taplar> lol, hell if i know, ^_^
[17:38:55] <wolfravenous> taplar:  THAT IS IT!!!!
[17:39:05] <taplar> yay
[17:39:33] <taplar> i learned something today.  coffeescript is whitespace sensitive.  :s
[17:39:39] <robertmaxrees> yeah....
[17:39:47] <wolfravenous> robertmaxrees:  what is it if not coffeescript?  I thought it was cause the stackoverflow page said it was.
[17:40:09] <robertmaxrees> coffeescript is just the syntactic sugar.
[17:40:17] <robertmaxrees> that .filter() call is still jquery.
[17:40:34] <wolfravenous> taplar: it doesn’t have to be the best approach, it just has to work… I just need it to help me automate writing my reports…
[17:40:54] <taplar> i have an inherient need for it to not be crappy, ;)
[17:41:05] <robertmaxrees> yeah, never go for “it just has to work”.
[17:41:16] <robertmaxrees> always go for “it’s a decent solution”
[17:41:58] <taplar> doesn't help that for the last few weeks i've been in tuning mode so i'm all hyper looking for performance gains
[17:42:28] <wolfravenous> robertmaxrees:  thanks  I am going to plug taplar’s jsfiddle into my reports.coffee file and see if it plays nice with the rest of the rails app… If it does I may do a little dance here behind my desk, lol
[17:42:38] <robertmaxrees> lol
[17:42:48] <robertmaxrees> take a little time and learn js fwiw.
[17:42:50] <robertmaxrees> it’s not hard.
[17:42:58] <taplar> thecodinelove gif or it never happened
[17:43:07] <taplar> codine? lmao
[17:43:35] * taplar starts the countdown for a site plug
[17:44:11] <wolfravenous> robertmaxrees:  I am a science teacher hacking together a rails app to automate writing student reports… Any solution is a great solution to me, heehe
[17:44:22] <robertmaxrees> heh.
[17:44:27] <taplar> wish i had teachers like you
[17:44:30] <robertmaxrees> then you know the importance of doing it well.
[17:44:31] <robertmaxrees> but awesome.
[17:45:36] <wolfravenous> I followed the Rails4InAction manual, and I even bought the coffescript pragmatic programmers book but I still couldn’t figure this one out with either…
[17:45:59] <robertmaxrees> fwiw i wouldn’t learn coffeescript.
[17:46:04] <wolfravenous> robertmaxrees:  taplar:  Thanks!
[17:46:05] <taplar> i think we're biast and would say pickup a javascript book, ;)
[17:46:51] <taplar> maybe https://www.amazon.com/JavaScript-Good-Parts-Douglas-Crockford/dp/0596517742
[17:47:05] <robertmaxrees> yeah.
[17:47:06] <robertmaxrees> start there.
[17:51:08] <wolfravenous> My wife just bought me another CS book, JumpStart CoffeScript.  I guess cause I was learning Ruby/Rails most of the folks there were suggesting I learn CS, however I just added that JS the good parts book to my wife’s book Amazon Wishlist. (at the top, heehe)
[17:51:19] <robertmaxrees> hah
[17:51:27] <robertmaxrees> yeah, that’s a good place to start
[17:51:40] <robertmaxrees> with the new js stuff that’s coming out it’s a little dated but it’s still pretty solid.
[17:52:24] <taplar> i also like this one: https://addyosmani.com/resources/essentialjsdesignpatterns/book/
[17:52:35] <taplar> which is pretty much all online there
[17:53:20] <taplar> though that's beyond the basics iirc
[17:54:05] <verax5> so whats everyone been upto
[17:54:06] <wolfravenous> taplar:  Thanks will bookmark it.  Over the next couple of years I want to really get good at RoR and JS/CS because there are so many things I want to automate with applications (like writing reports)  and it seems like the off the shelf solutions never actually do exactly what you want
[17:54:25] <taplar> verax5: unit tests
[17:54:27] <robertmaxrees> for what it’s worth RoR is kind of... not as popular as it once was?
[17:54:38] <robertmaxrees> you could do a lot with node.js and just know JS.
[17:54:38] <verax5> ph unit taplar?
[17:55:14] <taplar> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing
[17:55:44] <verax5> i knw was wondering if your using any framework or ibrrary for it like php unit
[17:55:54] <taplar> Spock in groovy
[17:56:12] <wolfravenous> taplar: at least if I write it from scratch it will do what i want…. I have never used node.  may give it a look over holiday break.
[17:56:32] <taplar> wolfravenous: it's more about empowering yourself
[17:56:40] <taplar> if you wrote it and understand it, you can change/fix it
[17:56:50] <taplar> or enhance it
[17:57:38] <wolfravenous> taplar: and if you can’t you can always beg for help on IRC, heehe
[17:58:05] <taplar> you start digging and learning and ideas will start popping in your head, "hey, I could do this with this..... or this with this!!!"
[17:58:48] <taplar> always an option, :)
[18:00:18] <taplar> but as a science teacher, you want your kids to figure stuff out, not always ask you, right?  ;)
[18:04:37] <wolfravenous> taplar:  true, but sometimes help is good, btw, I plugged those last few modified lines into my report.coffee file and they worked perfectly.  Now I just have to extrapolate as I am using that configuration about half a dozen times throughout the form and it all ties back to that subject selection to filter out other selector boxes dynamically.
[22:33:37] <FishPencil> I have two different <table>'s that I'd like to switch their appearance. What should be used to hide the one and show the other?
