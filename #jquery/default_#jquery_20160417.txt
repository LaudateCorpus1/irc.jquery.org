[06:25:52] <midori-rus> hello there. I am trying to use Import to make jquery scripts as modules. I make it like that http://laravel.io/bin/Oelj3 but then I try to call Basket.init(); I have got an error: TypeError: _Basket2.default.init is not a function

[09:52:25] <zap0> seems to work about 1/2 the time
[10:47:20] <Kartagis> I recall there was a way to add a click handler for pseudo-classes. am I remembering wrong?
[11:37:11] <vaindil> I'm writing a userscript and trying to bind $.on() to a button that exists on the page natively. The button is a div and is styled with a couple classes. The button styling adds a tiny amount of space under the actual button, also native. When I bind the event, it works only when I click on that tiny whitespace under the button--clicking the button itself has no effect.
[11:37:20] <vaindil> I'm not sure what would cause this to happen; shouldn't clicking anywhere on the div fire it?
[12:09:24] <zap0> div has bubble?
[12:14:49] <vaindil> zap0: I just discovered it has e.preventDefault() natively on the element. Does that prevent a click event bound later from firing?
[12:15:08] <zap0> that is most likely part of the problem
[12:15:52] <vaindil> It would be great if I could use appendTo() on an object that doesn't exist yet, but obviously that doesn't make sense. :P
[12:16:50] <vaindil> The click event that's native on the page adds the content from the script itself, the HTML is hardcoded into the script. It's rather annoying.
[12:17:32] <vaindil> I just tried wrapping in my own div and binding the click event to that, but it still doesn't work. Ugh.
[12:17:40] <vaindil> *wrapping the button in my own div
