[01:59:41] <TeddyMurray> im the best jquery developer in the world. fact.
[02:18:01] <loganlee> hello i'm in love with jquery.... i'm reading a 400 page book right now!
[02:18:21] <loganlee> $(this).wrap('cool');
[13:16:17] <jak2000> hi all, how to detect an enter key on a select bootstrap input? i try: https://jsfiddle.net/9v784xLt/   wihtout luck
[13:18:00] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 what have you tried to troubleshoot?>
[13:18:18] <taplar> right click on what you are hitting enter on and inspect it
[13:18:29] <robertmaxrees> ^ this is where I was heading.
[13:18:51] <robertmaxrees> because https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/uwr81Ltz/2/
[13:19:32] <jak2000> i try:
[13:19:46] <jak2000> type: in<enter>
[13:19:52] <robertmaxrees> nonono
[13:20:03] <robertmaxrees> i mean in code - how are you validating that you're even selecting the right thing?
[13:20:24] <robertmaxrees> take a look at the fiddle i just linked for an example./
[13:21:16] <jak2000> ok
[13:21:27] <jak2000> i try: $(document).on("keydown", "#xSelectArtic", function() {      but not display the alert
[13:21:27] <robertmaxrees> see how it's not impacting the element you're expecting?
[13:21:33] <jak2000> not impacting
[13:21:34] <jak2000> :(
[13:21:43] <jak2000> checking your fiddle
[13:21:44] <robertmaxrees> right, you need to validate that you're selecting the right element.
[13:21:47] <robertmaxrees> currently, you're not.
[13:22:54] <jak2000> when do: right click inpect, i am on this line: <span class="filter-option pull-left">Indonesia <small class="text-muted">INA</small></span>
[13:23:12] <robertmaxrees> right.  notice how the id you'r trying to use isn't a parent of that element?
[13:23:24] <robertmaxrees> specifically of the input in the dropdown.
[13:23:50] <robertmaxrees> now, why are you binding to keyup of the enter key?
[13:29:22] * robertmaxrees plays the jeopardy think music.
[13:30:02] <taplar> also for referencing: https://developer.snapappointments.com/bootstrap-select/options/#bootstrap-version
[13:30:15] <robertmaxrees> yup
[13:33:56] <jak2000> checking
[13:56:18] <robertmaxrees> welp
[14:08:11] <taplar> i learning a lot from SO today
[14:08:15] <robertmaxrees> oh?
[14:08:25] <taplar> did you know to use a variable in a string, you have to use concatenation?
[14:08:31] <robertmaxrees> lol
[14:08:39] <taplar> 2 questions, already, -_-
[14:10:49] <robertmaxrees> yikes
[14:22:21] <agile_prg> I have a weird question, I have to alter the classes on like 4 parents up, I would rather store the reference to this object then do .parent().parent().parent() etc...  is that possible?
[14:22:34] <robertmaxrees> then or than?
[14:22:52] <agile_prg> than I believe
[14:23:01] <robertmaxrees> you can do that.
[14:23:16] <robertmaxrees> just select it and store it in a var.
[14:23:18] <agile_prg> var obj = $('#myid').parent().parent().parent(); ?
[14:23:39] <robertmaxrees> and don't chain .parent() - use .closest('foo') instead
[14:24:06] <agile_prg> I don't know how to use closest in this way as the outer parent does not have an id
[14:24:16] <robertmaxrees> does it have any classes?
[14:24:24] <agile_prg> yes like 4 or 5
[14:24:31] <robertmaxrees> you can select on classes, too :)
[14:24:38] <agile_prg> but they are not unique and could vary
[14:24:45] <agile_prg> the chaining of parents is working
[14:24:53] <robertmaxrees> i would add a deterministic class for this instead
[14:24:55] <agile_prg> my next issue is I have to replace a class in this object
[14:25:03] <agile_prg> well, I would but it would take too long
[14:25:16] <robertmaxrees> otherwise you're bound to the shape of your markup, which is very fragile.
[14:25:19] <agile_prg> anyway, I will work on it, many thanks
[14:25:21] <taplar> ^^^
[14:25:26] <robertmaxrees> also: addClass and removeClass both take multiple classes.
[14:25:33] <robertmaxrees> you don't have to call them multiple times.
[14:25:50] <agile_prg> brb
[14:34:42] <agile_prg> ok cool, I am back
[14:36:14] <agile_prg> its a bootstrap card if that helps
[14:36:51] <robertmaxrees> you can still give those custom classes fwiw.
[14:37:14] <agile_prg> ya I would have to do that in like 60 places +, do not have time to do that just now
[14:37:35] <robertmaxrees> :shrug: it'll save you a bunch of headaches but alright :)
[14:37:47] <robertmaxrees> wait are you not using a templating engine?
[14:38:14] <agile_prg> well, it wasn't coded that way, it is using python flask, he hard coded everything, he was an intern
[14:38:24] <agile_prg> if he used templates it would have been easy
[14:38:29] <robertmaxrees> ah.
[14:38:29] <agile_prg> ok, there is a card class
[14:38:39] <agile_prg> maybe I could do nearest card?
[14:38:49] <robertmaxrees> yeah.  .closest('.card')
[14:39:01] <agile_prg> soooo happy I am talking to you!
[14:40:59] <agile_prg> yup the .closest worked!
[14:41:20] <agile_prg> robertmaxrees just curious what front end libraries you like, I am partial to jquery and bootstrap
[14:41:28] <robertmaxrees> depends on what i'm building.
[14:41:30] <agile_prg> I have not done too much with react, but cannot stand angular
[14:41:47] <robertmaxrees> those are all pretty different :)
[14:41:56] <agile_prg> I am using jexcel for the first time, it is kind of cool
[14:42:13] <agile_prg> I love this monolithic widgets you can do almost anything with
[14:42:18] <agile_prg> this = these
[14:46:04] <agile_prg> robertmaxrees tell me how you choose your front end libraries just curious
[14:46:15] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[14:46:16] <robertmaxrees> i don't.
[14:46:19] <robertmaxrees> my department does.
[14:46:30] <robertmaxrees> it's a collective process and it depends on the problem we're trying to solve.
[14:47:06] <robertmaxrees> because i work in ecom and not as apart of, say, a design firm, i'm not spinning up new frontend projects like others might.
[14:47:29] <robertmaxrees> it also means that whatever we choose will be actively worked in for a longer period of time.
[14:47:36] <agile_prg> I need to convert attr('class') to a string then use split on it
[14:47:42] <agile_prg> any ideas how I do that?
[14:47:48] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[14:47:51] <robertmaxrees> why are you doing that?
[14:48:08] <agile_prg> I need to search for the exact name of the class I want to replace
[14:48:13] <robertmaxrees> uh
[14:48:23] <robertmaxrees> you need to just .removeClass('foo') and then .addClass('bar')
[14:48:36] <agile_prg> I don't know the exact name, it could have different endings
[14:48:42] <robertmaxrees> ?
[14:48:44] <robertmaxrees> that seems... odd.
[14:48:53] <agile_prg> color-primary
[14:48:54] <robertmaxrees> what is the class being used for in this case?
[14:48:56] <agile_prg> color-error
[14:48:59] <agile_prg> color-yellow
[14:49:06] <agile_prg> it is from bootstrap
[14:49:10] <robertmaxrees> got it.
[14:49:19] <robertmaxrees> though that's still kind of strange.
[14:49:27] <robertmaxrees> you could do .prop('class').split(' ');
[14:49:31] <robertmaxrees> that'll get you an array.
[14:49:36] <agile_prg> yes way cool
[14:49:58] <robertmaxrees> then when you're ready to set the class property just do .prop('class', theArray.join(' ')); or w/e
[14:50:36] <agile_prg> darn that did not work for me
[14:51:02] <robertmaxrees> what to you mean?
[14:51:06] <agile_prg> oh now it owrked
[14:51:13] <agile_prg> split() vs split(' ')
[14:51:20] <agile_prg> I thought the default was one blank space
[14:51:23] <agile_prg> oh well
[14:51:58] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/split - "If separator is omitted or does not occur in str, the returned array contains one element consisting of the entire string."
[14:54:06] <agile_prg> I need to test if 'color-' is in the string classname I hate indexOf, can I use in or something easier?
[14:54:26] <robertmaxrees> that's what i would use.
[14:54:42] <agile_prg> you woudld use indexOf?
[14:54:46] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[14:54:58] <agile_prg> ok
[14:54:59] <robertmaxrees> there are other options but your ability to use them depends on what ESs versions you need to support.
[19:47:47] <Valleyant> Hey all, I'm pretty new at jquery and ran into a weird issue with buttonset. All it does is remove my radio buttons entirely
