[11:43:28] <Pazician> hello everyone. Why can't I find the .messages-wrapper class? https://pastee.org/fkyqe
[11:43:55] <Pazician> it gets length of 0 all the time, I can't get my head around how to find it...
[11:44:27] <Woet> Pazician: www.jsfiddle.net
[11:45:19] <Pazician> Woet: https://jsfiddle.net/1834aL5k/
[11:45:52] <Woet> Pazician: is that a working test case?
[11:46:10] <Woet> Pazician: do you need all that HTML and an AJAX request to make a test case?
[11:46:32] <Pazician> Woet: what's the problem?
[11:46:57] <Woet> Pazician: it should be a test case demonstrating your problem. it's not.
[11:48:38] <Pazician> Woet: scaled down the html, the problem is that I can't find the .messages-wrapper https://jsfiddle.net/1834aL5k/1/
[11:49:03] <Pazician> basically you can see the structure
[11:49:06] <Woet> Pazician: okay, you're talking about $(this).closest('.delete-msg-val').closest('.messages-wrapper').fadeOut(800); right?
[11:49:12] <Pazician> yep
[11:49:20] <Woet> Pazician: please make a test case that actually executes it then
[11:49:50] <Pazician> I just made it? It doesn't work, that's why I'm asking for help
[11:50:29] <Woet> Pazician: it's inside the success callback of your AJAX request
[11:50:37] <Woet> Pazician: the AJAX request does not work, it's not being executed
[11:50:53] <Woet> Pazician: that's why the console.log is not showing up.
[12:03:32] <smgs> hi! how to check a radio button when it loads fully, it loads on the same page after it is triggered by some other event. so it is like loads not once a webpage has loaded, but after some submit button is clicked, after that submit button is clicked, then the radio button is available to be checked, how can i check that radio button ? thanks
[14:18:22] <instigator> Hello. I have an html table containing radio buttons. after a user selects a radio button, then clicks a button, jquery is used to store the html of the table (including the selected radio button) in a variable. However, the html table stored in a variable doesnt contain a selected radio button (i.e. there is no checked proprty in the html). heres my code: http://jsbin.com/cabapaziro/1/edit?html,css,output
[14:19:02] <instigator> could this be a bug?
