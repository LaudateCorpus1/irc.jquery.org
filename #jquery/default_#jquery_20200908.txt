[00:00:10] <robertmaxrees> and don't just copy/paste scripts into the page - make separate JS files for that.
[00:08:28] <TMC> thanks for the server issue it was very useful
[00:08:42] <robertmaxrees> i would revert that change for your site btw.
[00:12:14] <TMC> why?
[00:12:41] <robertmaxrees> because relative urls are easier to wrangle.  there's a reason it was written that way ;)
[03:39:48] <DerpGusta> anyone here?
[03:46:02] <undefined_bob> DerpGusta: yes. Just ask your question. And if someone is here who can aswer it, you will get an other. But sometimes you have to wait a bit until you get an answer
[03:50:54] <DerpGusta> I'm using django and have the following template and its output respectively https://bpa.st/MXVA .
[03:51:38] <DerpGusta> I want to dynamically add values to the second element (the metric field) when a key_area is selected.
[03:53:52] <DerpGusta> as you can see in the output, there are two selects with ids id-form-*-key_area and id-from-*-metric. I want to be able to change the html of just the neighbouring metric field instead of all the fields. Is it possible?
[04:16:32] <Cork> DerpGusta: firstly i would really recommend using classes instead of [id$=] and [id^=] as those are both messy and slow
[04:17:05] <Cork> secondly what is the data you get from the ajax call?
[04:24:23] <DerpGusta> Cork, select options
[04:24:39] <Cork> so i suspect you mean "html"
[04:25:53] <Cork> DerpGusta: so what exactly is the related element?
[04:27:55] <DerpGusta> Cork, the highlighted select in this pic https://imgur.com/a/NeWmt9W
[04:28:22] <Cork> DerpGusta: where is that in the html?
[04:29:23] <Cork> ah, i think i get it now
[04:29:31] <DerpGusta> it's the selects after the key-area ones
[04:29:49] <Cork> DerpGusta: i would recommend adding a data-related="" with the id of the related select element
[04:30:07] <Cork> and then you can select the correct element from the handler based on that
[04:30:31] <Cork> as they aren't grouped in any meaningfull way you can't connect them implicitly
[04:30:52] <DerpGusta> cool
[04:30:58] <Cork> oh, wait man i read like shit to day
[04:31:25] <Cork> DerpGusta: $(this).siblings('select') should work
[04:31:49] <Cork> then you should prob add a class for key_area and metric to identify what element you got
[04:31:57] <DerpGusta> Cork, I was trying this lol  $(this).closest("td").next().find("select").html(data);
[04:32:00] <Cork> makes finding results easier
[04:32:52] <Cork> DerpGusta: would do something like  $(this).closest("tr").find("select.metric").html(data);
[04:33:23] <Cork> and like i said i would remove all those ids and replace them with classes
[04:34:15] <Cork> what i mean is: <select name="form-1-metric" class="custom-select" id="id_form-1-metric"> => <select name="form-1-metric" class="custom-select metric" data-group="1">
[04:34:39] <Cork> cause you don't EVER want to use ids to group elements
[04:35:41] <DerpGusta> Cork, Those ids were automatically generated. I might be able to change them though. Thanks for the help man!
[04:35:44] <Cork> DerpGusta: actually i would move the id_form-1 id to  <tr class="text-center" id="id_form-1">
[04:36:06] <Cork> DerpGusta: you can leave them if something else generate them, but i would add a sane class for selection
[04:36:33] <DerpGusta> Cork yeah. I can do that
[04:38:44] <Cork> DerpGusta: https://jsfiddle.net/tk5s3a8q/
[04:38:47] <Cork> this is what i meant
[04:39:05] <Cork> (note changes in both js and html)
[04:39:31] <Cork> fixed typo https://jsfiddle.net/tk5s3a8q/1/
[09:14:01] <DerpGusta> Cork, Hey man. Good news. The jsfiddle did not work for me. It wasn't focusing on the select field. But I tried another query -> $(self).parent().parent().find('select.metric').html(data);
[09:14:01] <DerpGusta>  which worked perfectly. Now, Is it okay if I leave it like that?
[09:14:56] <Cork> DerpGusta: .parent().parent() is normally a bad idea as it requires the exact dom structure or it will break
[09:15:23] <Cork> closest('tr') should do the same as long as your html is valid and isn't moved around by error correction
[09:17:15] <DerpGusta> Cork, cool. It works!
[09:21:38] <DerpGusta> have been trying for a long time. Learned some jquery on the way. Thanks for your help man.
[09:21:49] <Cork> np
[17:31:22] <guideX> I am using jquery 1.10, should I upgrade?
[17:31:45] <robertmaxrees> 1.x and 2.x are both deprecated, so probably :)
[17:32:01] <robertmaxrees> though it also depends on what browsers you need to support.
[17:32:03] <guideX> do you think that, the potential problems with it, outweigh the sort of lack of support
[17:32:44] <robertmaxrees> i mean, i tend to advocate for updating things when you can.  but again it really depends on the browsers you need to support.
[17:32:59] <robertmaxrees> and also what infrastructure you have in place for polyfills and shims and the like.
[17:33:08] <guideX> well was hoping to support internet explorer, but too bad if it's like 7 or below
[17:33:12] <guideX> maybe 8 also
[17:33:17] <guideX> and new browsers
[17:33:35] <robertmaxrees> your analytics show people are using IE 8 on your site?
[17:33:42] <guideX> we are a trucking company
[17:33:52] <guideX> mostly old people using ie
[17:34:09] <guideX> err idk if they're MOSTLY, but many
[17:34:36] <robertmaxrees> gotcha.  yeah, jquery 1.x wound up supporting back to IE6.
[17:35:05] <robertmaxrees> the 2.x line is the same featuresets but dropped a bunch of browser suppport to make things lightter.
[17:35:14] <robertmaxrees> 3.x supports back to IE 9.
[17:35:19] <guideX> a lot of the people are like, at other trucking companies, with outdated computers running ie certainly
[17:35:56] <guideX> hmm so maybe just leave it alone? I do see errors occuring during debug in my jquery file
[17:36:05] <guideX> I suppose I may have no choice if I want to fix that
[17:36:09] <robertmaxrees> sure - i work on a site that caters to building professionals.  we just let our analytics decide if it's worth the cost to support older IE.
[17:36:16] <robertmaxrees> what errors are you seeing?
[17:38:18] <guideX> https://pastebin.com/raw/gxiVPgME
[17:38:38] <guideX> DOMException: Failed to execute 'querySelectorAll' on 'Element': '*,:x' is not a valid selector. line 1654
[17:38:53] <robertmaxrees> that looks like an issue with your code.
[17:38:59] <guideX> ah ok :)
[17:39:03] <guideX> i'll look for that then
[17:39:13] <robertmaxrees> you've got a weird selector going on.
[17:39:32] <guideX> it is coming from this line of code div.querySelectorAll("*,:x");
[17:39:42] <robertmaxrees> is that some of your code?
[17:39:43] <guideX> I'm not really sure if it's my code, or maybe the *,:x?
[17:39:47] <guideX> no that's in the jquery file
[17:40:00] <robertmaxrees> yeah, so something calling jquery is passing in a weird selector.
[17:40:10] <guideX> ah ok
[17:40:55] <guideX> and then same thing on line 1671 matches.call(div, "[s!='']:x");
[17:40:56] <robertmaxrees> ah wait.
[17:41:03] <robertmaxrees> that's expected./
[17:41:07] <guideX> ah ok
[17:42:45] <guideX> well thanks
[17:42:46] <robertmaxrees> quick google search for that one :)
[17:43:15] <robertmaxrees> either way - at a certain point, don't be afraid to start exploring deprecating your existing frontend and freezing it or w/e.
[17:43:38] <robertmaxrees> since a lot of those older browsers don't recieve any active support even from microsoft.
[17:43:51] <guideX> yeah true
[17:46:11] <guideX> I guess this error doesn't matter, because, no one but me (in debug with javascript debugging turned on) will ever see it, so who cares
[17:46:38] <guideX> per some randos on stackoverflow anyways
[17:46:41] <robertmaxrees> yeah.  that's being caught by jquery.  nothing is actually breaking necessarily.
