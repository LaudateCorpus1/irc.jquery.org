[01:11:42] <bigmac> any one mind looking at a jsfiddle
[01:11:51] <Cork> ?ask @ bigmac
[01:11:56] <Cork> <_<
[01:11:57] <bigmac> any item above Or below the screen, fade out
[01:12:04] <bigmac> http://jsfiddle.net/b7qnrsrz/118/
[01:12:16] <bigmac> im messing with the if expressions
[01:12:55] <Cork> If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[01:13:29] <bigmac> well, yah
[01:13:52] <bigmac> i feel its a if expression im struggling with
[01:13:58] <Cork> bigmac: you need to use .stop
[01:14:04] <Cork> else the animations can be out of sync
[01:14:15] <Cork> also i recommend using :visible instead of css('opacity')
[01:14:36] <Cork> btw you can use fadeToggle instead
[01:14:58] <Cork> currently if an element ends up at say opacity 0.8 the element gets skipped
[01:16:10] <xaxxon> $("#foo").focus() - if #foo is a text input, that will make it so that if you start typing, it goes to #foo, right?  (not working for me)
[01:16:34] <Cork> xaxxon: ya, as long as there isn't another element with the same id
[01:16:49] <xaxxon> well if I say $("#foo").hide() it disappears...
[01:17:48] <Cork> xaxxon: http://jsfiddle.net/u1qbzxwz/
[01:18:08] <xaxxon> thank you
[01:25:25] <xaxxon> yeah, if I do everything the same except say .val("FOO") instead of .focus(), it works fine and sets the text value when I click the button.. :-\
[01:25:42] <xaxxon> and I've verified it's only returning 1 result
[01:25:48] <xaxxon> I"ll see if I can run it somewher
[01:25:54] <xaxxon> to share
[01:41:37] <adv_>  comm.connect('custom room', {audio: true, video: false}); i have this, how can i change video to true via in a ('#mybutton').click() ?
[01:42:19] <xaxxon__> oh. can't focus an element that's not displayed.   That's.. annoying because I have something else coming along a split second later to make it be displayed
[01:42:35] <xaxxon__> and I don't really control the order in which it happens
[01:42:42] <Cork> xaxxon__: if you can or not depends on the browser
[01:42:50] <xaxxon__> ah
[01:42:56] <Cork> if you meant display: none though
[01:42:59] <xaxxon__> yes
[01:42:59] <Cork> then ya, that won't work
[01:43:16] <Cork> you could use opacity instead
[01:43:23] <Cork> or set focus after you've made it visible
[01:43:36] <Cork> (the later is prob the best option)
[01:43:53] <xaxxon__> yeah, unfortunately the setting of the display is handled "magically"
[01:44:26] <Cork> fadeIn?
[01:45:14] <xaxxon__> no.  I set a variable to the value of the "screen" I wnat displayed   Meteor picks up that the variable changes and rerenders a template which has CSS to have it now be visible
[01:45:39] <Cork> so set the focus state after that
[01:45:58] <xaxxon__> yeah, I'm just not sure how to inject code at the right spot
[01:46:24] <xaxxon__> I mean.. I have some ideas
[01:47:49] <xaxxon__> I'm just not familiar enough with the order in which things happen and get called to know where to put it, but I'm sure I can figure it out.  it also requires keeping additional state information that I was hoping to avoid
[01:48:23] <adv_> anyone? how can i access the comm obj ?
[01:49:10] <nikhil_> is there a simple way to make the quantithy input controls on this page (http://preview.oklerthemes.com/porto/3.8.0/shop-product-sidebar.html) work? I was thinking of checking onClick() is that fine?
[01:50:15] <Cork> adv_: too little context
[01:50:23] <adv_> Cork: http://icecomm.io/docs
[01:51:46] <Cork> adv_: well you have to store the variable so you can access it
[01:51:53] <Cork> if that is what you mean
[01:52:38] <adv_> Cork: i know how to set it up initially but not how to change it on runtime
[01:53:07] <Cork> adv_: ... you need to give the context of what you're trying to do
[01:53:18] <Cork> or you're just wasting ppls time
[01:53:43] <adv_> http://jsfiddle.net/TawnyOwl/j228hopd/
[01:54:10] <adv_> Cork: so there's audio:false on startup , how can i change it to true via a button.click() ?
[02:06:31] <bigmac> during a scroll, when a div enters and leaves the screen i hope to add or remove a class
[02:06:46] <bigmac> up or down scroll
[02:08:59] <adv_> Cork: ?
[02:10:09] <Cork> adv_: is the fiddle meant to work at all?
[02:10:23] <adv_> Cork: yes it works
[02:10:25] <Cork> i still don't have a clue what you're trying to do
[02:10:52] <Cork> all i get is a white page
[02:11:07] <adv_> Cork: it inits with audio: false, i want to alter this at some moment (upon clicking a button) to true
[02:11:20] <adv_> i don't know how to do this, how to access it.
[02:11:49] <adv_> it's not visual
[02:17:03] <marandi> hi guys i want to change sepcific color in whole page with another color , how can i do that ?!
[02:17:27] <Cork> marandi: set a class on body and have it affect those colors
[02:18:23] <marandi> hey Cork , i think i said it wrong , let me upload my css file and show u what i want
[02:18:42] <Cork> marandi: make a jsfiddle demo instead
[02:21:17] <marandi> Cork: its take so long to create it on jsfiddle
[02:21:25] <marandi> Cork: can u check it out please ? https://gist.github.com/gists
[02:21:35] <Cork> marandi: you don't need all of it
[02:21:42] <Cork> just enough to show what you're trying to do
[02:26:28] <Cork> marandi: http://jsfiddle.net/kq0j4n4j/
[02:29:43] <pauled> Hi, I am looking for help to save selection in a button http://fiddle.jshell.net/mawekuwe/c38hwfxy/
[02:30:33] <pauled> example I select one formula and then click on a button "add bookmark"
[02:32:41] <goodenough> did u write any js for it yet?
[02:33:22] <pauled> nope, I don't know where to start
[02:36:20] <goodenough> maybe get the value of one of those input elements, and store it in a variable
[02:37:40] <Shadow> Hi, can anyone help with this http://jsfiddle.net/p89ka9jq/22/ please. I'm trying to get it to do the same as this http://jsfiddle.net/3jr2v/705/
[02:42:03] <pauled> goodenough: I am googling how to save selection in variable, do you have an example?
[02:43:33] <goodenough> $('thiselementclass').click(function(){var newVar = $('inputelementclass');});
[02:43:40] <goodenough> sumting like that
[02:44:13] <Shadow> can anyone help with my question, please
[02:44:42] <pauled> thanks
[02:45:56] <pauled> goodenough: is one by one?
[02:46:19] <goodenough> shadow, make sure the right dependencies are loaded
[02:47:09] <Shadow> goodenough: I'm lost with this
[02:47:35] <goodenough> pauled: dont know what u mean, but first get the button, when clicked, to show an alert
[02:47:50] <pauled> ok
[02:48:01] <goodenough> $('thiselementclass').click(function(){alert('hi');});
[02:50:13] <goodenough> shadow: the two fiddles have different dependencies, one has sumoselect, the other multiselect
[02:51:47] <Shadow> goodenough: yes thats correct.
[03:02:32] <dimi1947> How am I going to check is some elements exist in the DOM...click the add div in this fiddle  https://jsfiddle.net/fiddlehunt/v6vujo86/  2 more inputs are added to the DOM...how am I going to check that these are ther....I want a code to run based on their existence
[03:03:15] <dimi1947> O conditional....if(present these 2 inputs)
[03:03:39] <Uhkis> $(element).length
[03:04:25] <dimi1947> I suppose if no element is in the DOM length will return zero
[03:12:29] <Cork> dimi1947: if($().length > 0)
[03:12:49] <Cork> ah, Uhkis already answered
[03:15:05] <dimi1947> yes...thanks...both
[03:29:46] <marandi> Cork: thanks for the advice and sorry about delay !
[03:29:57] <marandi> Cork: can i ask you another thing ?
[03:30:13] <marandi> Cork: its better i fiddle it â€¦ wait
[05:05:23] <fritz4fun> Whats the diff between these both bootstrap libraries for tables: datatables.net/examples/styling/bootstrap.html and github.com/wenzhixin/bootstrap-table
[05:11:14] <fritz4fun> What would be easier to use but still very powerful:  datatables.net/examples/styling/bootstrap.html vs.  github.com/wenzhixin/bootstrap-table
[05:18:32] <andalusiaa> Hi! Please can someone help me. I have a click slidetoggle going on, but it won't work after the first click!
[05:21:08] <Uhkis> andalusiaa: fiddle?
[05:26:31] <andalusiaa> Uhkis: i'm not ignoring you, i'm setting one up.. it's a bit faffy
[05:28:27] <andalusiaa> Uhkis: and it works less on JSFiddle than it does my own set up... damnit
[05:29:39] <andalusiaa> Uhkis: i can't figure it out in JSFiddle. I'll have to keep trying to figure it out myself. irritating though
[05:29:51] <fattest_> my .css{} background colour is not changing more than once
[05:30:50] <andalusiaa> Uhkis: i seem to have narrowed it down to a conflict with another javascript query, when i call the slider code
[05:36:57] <fattest_> my background  colour is not being changed http://jsfiddle.net/wabd5hww/1/ please help
[05:37:03] <fattest_> even if add the .css
[05:40:28] <Cork> fattest_: are you asking about spectrum or what?
[05:40:47] <fattest_> Cork: spectrum is working fine, but how do I make it change my background colour (with jquery)
[05:41:14] <Cork> background color of what?
[05:41:42] <fattest_> Cork: body
[05:42:01] <fattest_> Cork: the <body> background colour
[05:42:40] <Cork> fattest_: first of don't use alert for debugging
[05:42:44] <Cork> it hangs the browser >_<
[05:42:48] <fattest_> ok
[05:43:00] <Cork> always use console.log
[05:43:36] <fattest_> ok
[05:46:06] <Cork> fattest_: http://jsfiddle.net/wabd5hww/3/
[05:46:27] <fattest_> Cork: thank you so much
[05:47:53] <Cork> fattest_: the problem was in that the variable was an object and not just a string
[05:48:03] <Cork> so calling toHex() solved that
[05:48:06] <fattest_> okaok
[05:48:09] <fattest_> oh ok*
[05:48:10] <fattest_> thanks

[05:51:21] <xqo> hi, im uploading files. how can I make a unique file ID based on file attributes like file-size, file-type, last-modified-date, etc? http://jsfiddle.net/eL4uy8n7/1/
[06:11:54] <Cork> xqo: don't
[06:12:04] <xqo> Cork what do i do instead?
[06:12:05] <Cork> xqo: the file upload should contain the "real name" of the file
[06:12:11] <Cork> making them unique should happen server side
[06:12:18] <xqo> its all client side
[06:12:30] <Cork> that is a really bad idea
[06:12:33] <xqo> why
[06:30:34] <dimi1947> I have attached hover() in a div twice....for 2 images....I want to unbind that only for one image....if I use off the unbinding takes place for both images...what can I do?
[06:31:54] <rindolf> Hi all.
[06:40:48] <andalusiaa> ok, can somebody help me with a very weird issue please.
[06:40:59] <andalusiaa> look at the following link: http://testing.tristandanielgage.co.uk/cbc/1/
[06:41:10] <rindolf> andalusiaa: hi , let me see.
[06:41:15] <andalusiaa> hi rindolf
[06:41:21] <andalusiaa> please look at that link and see the burger menu at the top
[06:41:32] <andalusiaa> if oyu click on it, then the menu slides up, correct?
[06:42:37] <rindolf> andalusiaa: what happens here is that the page becomes empty.
[06:42:54] <andalusiaa> what do you mean??
[06:43:13] <rindolf> andalusiaa: I get a white page in Firefox.
[06:43:18] <andalusiaa> oh, can you refresh??
[06:43:27] <rindolf> andalusiaa: after I press the men ubutton with the three horizontal lines.
[06:43:35] <rindolf> andalusiaa: yes, I can.
[06:43:39] <andalusiaa> oh really. let me try in firefox
[06:44:02] <andalusiaa> ah it all fucks up, if you scroll to the right in firefox it's all still there
[06:44:27] <andalusiaa> rindolf: that is a separate issue i will have to figure out xD
[06:44:38] <andalusiaa> can you still see the burger menu after oyu've clicked it??
[06:44:51] <rindolf> andalusiaa: in Firefox or in Chromium?
[06:45:11] <rindolf> andalusiaa: in Chromium, I can still see the menu icon.
[06:45:14] <andalusiaa> If you have chrome, please use that - it seems to be working ok in ther
[06:45:18] <andalusiaa> ok good.
[06:45:24] <rindolf> But nothing happens when I click it.
[06:45:24] <andalusiaa> if you click it again, it doesn't do anything, correct?
[06:45:30] <rindolf> andalusiaa: yes, right.
[06:45:32] <andalusiaa> ok, now have a look at http://testing.tristandanielgage.co.uk/cbc/2/
[06:45:44] <andalusiaa> rindolf: i have put the burger menu in a different place, up in the top left corner of the whole window
[06:45:51] <andalusiaa> and now if you click it and then click it again it should function properly.
[06:46:03] <andalusiaa> my question is - do you have any idea why it stops working after the first click in the first example??
[06:46:14] <rindolf> andalusiaa: let me see.
[06:47:35] <dimi1947> does anyone know hoe to insert an image into jsfiddle
[06:48:20] <andalusiaa> dimi1947: host it somewhere online??
[06:48:24] <dimi1947> I uploaded an image ot onedrive...then used the link...but the image does not appear on fiddle
[06:48:33] <andalusiaa> can i see the fiddle?
[06:48:40] <dimi1947> https://jsfiddle.net/fiddlehunt/v6vujo86/2/
[06:48:56] <dimi1947> line 10...
[06:49:21] <andalusiaa> it's because you haven't actually linked to the image
[06:49:47] <dimi1947> how can I do that?
[06:49:47] <andalusiaa> dimi1947:  you need to use the direct link to the image
[06:50:06] <andalusiaa> it's this 'https://u50ayw.dm2303.livefilestore.com/y2mxcHEn7ZVax9KrYDNjIl16pVn7Ex3WsJjhDThdk7e0hYd2eiGVoSPOPTVAii7S5gB3jVbR2_GudvijV4aVWK42fnb40nPdIpzFNq9hGqL89O5svo9GSdRBdRBJ_jQrZKjBkumpa6jtI8JaHUj44t93FIPqxRJXfnrXbBAEcXnbmw/add-sched.png?psid=1'
[06:50:30] <dimi1947> how did you got this link?
[06:50:43] <andalusiaa> i went to the link that was originally there, and then clicked on View Original
[06:50:59] <andalusiaa> You know on OneDrive, when up at the top it says View Original? I clicked that
[06:51:05] <andalusiaa> rindolf: any luck??
[06:51:59] <dimi1947> got it...thanks
[06:52:07] <andalusiaa> no probs dimi1947
[06:52:21] <rindolf> andalusiaa: I'm trying.
[06:52:36] <andalusiaa> it's weird isn't it.
[06:52:43] <rindolf> andalusiaa: there are some differences in the CSS of the two pages - don't know if they are significant.
[06:52:46] <andalusiaa> i can put the burger link anywhere else on the page and it works!!
[06:52:56] <andalusiaa> .... are you sure???? because they are literally cloned copies except from the HTML
[06:53:29] <rindolf> andalusiaa: well, at least that's what firefox gives me in css_002.css.
[06:54:13] <andalusiaa> ...i don't know what css_002.css is
[06:54:22] <andalusiaa> i don't see that in my firefox
[06:55:30] <rindolf> andalusiaa: see http://paste.debian.net/183339/
[06:56:19] <andalusiaa> ahhhh
[06:56:27] <andalusiaa> rindolf: i have actually fixed the issue!!!
[06:56:44] <rindolf> andalusiaa: ah, what was the problem?
[06:57:19] <andalusiaa> well when menu is set to 'display:none;' which is what happens when i use the Slide Toggle, then it disappears from the DOM. so the next element is the #Main Div
[06:57:31] <andalusiaa> so in the CSS i set #main div to 'clear:both;'
[06:57:35] <andalusiaa> and that fixed it.
[06:58:00] <andalusiaa> it was a float issue that occurred when Menu was no longer available (which already had 'clear:both;' applied)
[06:58:38] <rindolf> andalusiaa: ah.
[06:59:23] <andalusiaa> rindolf: thank you for your help, and for having a look :-)
[07:02:04] <rindolf> andalusiaa: you're welcome.
[07:32:51] <andalusiaa> rindolf: that fix actually also fixed the firefox issue you had where everything would go blank
[07:32:52] <andalusiaa> :-)
[07:33:01] <rindolf> andalusiaa: ah, nice. :-).
[08:27:52] <PCatinean> is there a way to add a transition effect to a image when changing the src?
[08:27:56] <dimi1947> I have a problem unbindg hover(using off)...I have prepared a fiddle
[08:28:18] <robertmaxrees> PCatinean you have to transition between two images.
[08:28:22] <robertmaxrees> you can't just change the source.
[08:28:28] <PCatinean> hmm, damn
[08:28:48] <PCatinean> or fadeout, until completely out, change src, fadein
[08:28:49] <PCatinean> ?
[08:30:33] <robertmaxrees> that doesnt' guarantee the new image will be completely loaded.
[08:30:52] <PCatinean> robertmaxrees, that's true, how can I do that then?
[08:31:20] <rindolf> dimi1947: where is it?
[08:31:37] <robertmaxrees> have both images loaded on pageload, then swap between the two.
[08:33:50] <PCatinean> robertmaxrees, I find out which image I need to load on a event from the client
[08:34:08] <PCatinean> Maybe I can make two containers that overlap and on load of the image swap them around or idk
[08:34:20] <robertmaxrees> PCatinean what's the thing you're building?
[08:36:34] <PCatinean> robertmaxrees, a product configurator, and depending on the selected choices, the whole combination is sent to the server and it retreives a url to a image
[08:36:59] <robertmaxrees> hah, ditch the animations in that case.
[08:37:11] <robertmaxrees> and go for optimized images.
[08:41:47] <PCatinean> robertmaxrees, what do you mean by optimized images?
[08:42:00] <robertmaxrees> make sure you properly compress them, etc.
[08:42:05] <robertmaxrees> imagemagick is your friend.
[08:42:35] <PCatinean> not sure what you mean, I have a lot of images loaded in the background and depending on the combination sent one of them is picked
[08:42:39] <dimi1947> https://jsfiddle.net/fiddlehunt/v6vujo86/15/
[08:43:03] <robertmaxrees> PCatinean https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/optimizing-content-efficiency/image-optimization?hl=en
[08:43:06] <dimi1947> first click the add div
[08:43:36] <dimi1947> 2 icons will appear on hovering the monday element
[08:44:33] <dimi1947> tell when you get there and I will continue describing the problem exactly...
[08:44:48] <robertmaxrees> dimi1947 please just descripbe the problem in one or two sentences.
[08:46:02] <dimi1947> did you see the 2 icons?
[08:46:18] <dimi1947> If you click the minus icons...
[08:46:35] <robertmaxrees> yes.
[08:46:41] <robertmaxrees> please fully describe your problem
[08:48:05] <dimi1947> my purpose is that the minus icon is hidden and the hover applies only for the plus icon-this must happen when the function remBzone at line 30 is called....THE PROBLEM is that now the hover is removed for both icons and are both visible
[08:49:16] <xander_> Hi guys, does anyone know how to make turn,js flipbook to flip only horizontally(without folding the page as default http://www.turnjs.com/#samples/steve-jobs)
[08:49:55] <robertmaxrees> dimi1947 you mean the minus icon isn't showing?
[08:50:43] <arc_> no, i think he means he only wants one of them to show, but they are both showing
[08:50:59] <arc_> the minus icon image link is broken but i don't think that's important
[08:51:10] <robertmaxrees> i'm lost, but okay.
[08:52:38] <arc_> yeah idk this is confusing
[08:53:04] <robertmaxrees> dimi1947 try again - try explaining the whole problem instead of asking us to follow along :)
[08:55:00] <dimi1947> now when the function at line 30 is called(when the minus sign is clicked)....hover stops and both icons are visible....
[08:55:22] <robertmaxrees> so then hide the icons when you click.
[08:55:55] <dimi1947> I want(when the minus sign is clicked)....the minus sign to be hidden and hover only the plus sign...THAT IS THE PROBLEM
[08:56:00] <arc_> is it supposed to remove all of the fields that have been added, or just one
[08:56:10] <arc_> one row
[08:56:12] <robertmaxrees> dimi1947 okay - then hide the minus sign.
[08:56:31] <dimi1947> and about hover the plus sign
[08:56:41] <dimi1947> use the hover method?
[08:56:45] <robertmaxrees> i don't understand what "hover the plus sign" means.
[08:57:06] <arc_> i don't understand the functionality of this
[08:57:11] <arc_> there is no hover until you click add
[08:57:23] <arc_> when you click add, now the +/- appear on mouseover of the input fields
[08:57:30] <arc_> why
[08:57:54] <dimi1947> I am talking about what must take place after clicking add
[08:58:16] <arc_> ok. so you click add and it adds a row of fields
[08:58:21] <dimi1947> after clicking add 2 signs appear hovering.....are we ok with tthat?
[08:58:33] <arc_> then you click minus and it removes all the fields you have previously added
[08:58:47] <arc_> now in this state you want the plus sign to appear on mouseover?
[08:59:19] <dimi1947> yes....I want 2 things to be performed....hover the plus sign....hide the minus sign
[08:59:51] <dimi1947> AFTER clicking the minus sign....every code you must write must be located inside the function at line 30
[09:00:06] <arc_> okay, so what is the purpose of line 32
[09:00:12] <arc_> you are removing the hover event
[09:01:29] <arc_> the hover event includes both plus and minus, and works over the entire div that contains all of this content
[09:01:45] <dimi1947> line 32 does something I DO NOT WANT....
[09:01:49] <arc_> i agree
[09:01:54] <robertmaxrees> lol
[09:02:06] <dimi1947> it removes hover for both elements
[09:02:31] <dimi1947> 1st...maintain hover for plus sign
[09:02:39] <dimi1947> 2nd....hide minus sign
[09:02:43] <robertmaxrees> maintain the hover event binding, you mean?
[09:02:48] <arc_> just hide the minus sign instead of removing the event
[09:02:53] <robertmaxrees> because i think what you really want is a delegated listener.
[09:03:01] <dimi1947> explain
[09:03:25] <robertmaxrees> well, let's back up - why are you removing event listneers in the first place?
[09:05:05] <PCatinean> robertmaxrees, that's a nice read but does it have to do anything with the animation and how the data is downloaded?
[09:05:08] <PCatinean> sorry for interrupting btw
[09:05:09] <arc_> well i guess the problem is that a) he's created one event listener for both buttons, b) when you hide the minus sign, the hover event now makes it appear again
[09:05:26] <robertmaxrees> PCatinean optimize images and ditch the animation.
[09:05:37] <robertmaxrees> also: preload images.
[09:05:48] <PCatinean> but I want to have an animation
[09:05:54] <PCatinean> nah there are too many, lazy loading is required
[09:06:05] <robertmaxrees> i'm suggesting that you don't use an animation at all.
[09:06:11] <robertmaxrees> wel;come to ecommerce :)
[09:06:12] <arc_> so you can create two event listeners, one for each button, and remove the one for the minus sign, but if you do that you won't get the minus sign back until you reload the page or do something else to reactivate that event listener
[09:06:30] <arc_> or you can maybe do something else, which is above my pay grade
[09:06:39] <robertmaxrees> arc_ or they could use delegated listeners and stop juggling bindings :)
[09:06:46] <arc_> yeah that :p
[09:07:06] <dimi1947> ok are you ready to hear the logic?
[09:07:13] <robertmaxrees> dimi1947 huh?
[09:07:17] <arc_> i would love to
[09:08:05] <dimi1947> I am buidling a schedulling app...when there are only 2 input boxes the business user enters open/close times of a store....
[09:08:53] <dimi1947> the fiddle does not show exactly that...it is little messed....I just want to focus on the hover problem...anyway
[09:09:02] <robertmaxrees> then scope your problem to the hover.
[09:09:20] <dimi1947> what do you mean "scope"?
[09:10:05] <hassoon> why don't I get the fad-in effect of the said #div2 id? :o  http://paste.debian.net/183395/
[09:10:06] <robertmaxrees> why are you including a bunch of unrelated code?  why not make a simplified test case?
[09:10:12] <hassoon> i wanted the said element to appear gradually (but fast) when the page loads
[09:10:15] <hassoon> so i wrote that small jquery script
[09:10:20] <hassoon> but still, i can't get my fad-in effect.
[09:10:54] <dimi1947> as I said again....onclickingt the minus sign...2 input elements must be removers...the minus sign must be hiiden...and only hover for the plus sign must re,ain....THAT'S IT
[09:11:15] <robertmaxrees> then use a delegated event listener.  problem solved.
[09:11:34] <arc_> https://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/
[09:16:12] <dimi1947> I have to read this material now...huh
[09:16:19] <robertmaxrees> actually, not that material.
[09:16:29] <dimi1947> what then?
[09:16:34] <robertmaxrees> if you're using a backbone view, use its delegated listener.s
[09:16:58] <dimi1947> I do not understand
[09:17:07] <dimi1947> how am I going to use this?
[09:18:15] <robertmaxrees> are you familiar with the concept of event delegation?
[09:19:25] <dimi1947> unfortunately no
[09:20:14] <dimi1947> and more importantly I do not know how to use it in combination with backbone
[09:20:23] <robertmaxrees> http://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/ for the basics.
[09:20:41] <robertmaxrees> then check out http://backbonejs.org/#View-delegateEvents
[09:20:52] <robertmaxrees> basically, you're already kind of using them.
[09:21:23] <robertmaxrees> you basically never want to do $('#Monday').hover(function() {}); in backbone - use the events object.
[09:22:23] <dimi1947> the question is what I will achieve with event delegation...reading the intro I did not undersatnd how it will help in my case
[09:22:38] <dimi1947> I do use the events object in backbone
[09:23:07] <robertmaxrees> right - instead of binding, re-binding, and unbinding events, you bind a single listener and let it handle all of the work.
[09:23:55] <dimi1947> you have to give me an example....
[09:24:05] <dimi1947> if possible relative to my problem
[09:24:11] <robertmaxrees> err, read the docs first.
[09:24:14] <robertmaxrees> the concept is simple.
[09:25:19] <dimi1947> I am tired,,,later
[09:30:14] <robertmaxrees> long story short: https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/v6vujo86/16/
[09:31:58] <Anoniem4l> So I got a .click() event which triggers a .slideToggle(). My problem is that the element which is appearing sliding down goes too down / out of sight. How is it possible to scroll down automatically, with no mess on low resolutions?
[09:32:44] <robertmaxrees> you could scroll the window to the top of the thing you're toggling.
[09:34:02] <dimi1947> thanks robertmaxress...but we are half way there...I want the minus sign hidden...
[09:34:15] <dimi1947> only the plus appear on hover
[09:34:15] <Anoniem4l> robertmaxrees: if ($(next).is(':visible')) { $("html, body").animate({ scrollTop: $(next).offset().top }); } with $(next) being the element which is appearing.
[09:34:18] <robertmaxrees> update the event bindings to .hide() it when appropriate, then,.
[09:34:25] <Anoniem4l> robertmaxrees: The above messes up on low resolution.
[09:34:32] <robertmaxrees> how does it "mess up"?
[09:35:42] <Anoniem4l> robertmaxrees: Oh well I see what happens now, it scrolls exactly on it hiding it.
[09:35:55] <Anoniem4l> Hiding it I mean going out of sight.
[09:38:26] <Anoniem4l> robertmaxrees: Thanks for the help :).
[09:38:39] <robertmaxrees> sure
[09:44:06] <dimi1947> I found another solution...after all....
[09:44:26] <robertmaxrees> you really need to use backbone views correctly.
[09:44:38] * hd1 sighs some more
[09:44:44] <dimi1947> you must be more specific
[09:44:55] <robertmaxrees> i showed you an updated fiddle and explained it earlier.
[09:45:14] <k-joseph> hi guys, the https://jqueryui.com/dialog/ doesn't display the close though it works when i click where it's supposed to be, may be it's because of having same color as title bar, is there a way of customizing the title bar background color?
[09:45:16] <robertmaxrees> you're not using the events object correctly - you need to rely on it and event delegation, instead of using jquery event bindings in your methopds.
[09:45:17] <robertmaxrees> brb
[09:45:20] <hd1> yes, I know you did, robertmaxrees, but I'm an idiot :p
[09:45:31] <hd1> and broke it again
[09:46:37] <dimi1947> if you mean that I shoud use the event object...usually I do...I just did not use it on the fiddle you saw
[09:47:31] <dimi1947> and in the fiddle you gave me....I do not understand where you use event delegation
[09:49:49] <robertmaxrees> back
[09:50:14] <robertmaxrees> dimi1947 notice how i use the events object for the mouiseenter and mouseleave, instead of the explicit .hover() calls?
[09:52:23] <robertmaxrees> dimi1947 in backbone, when you specify events with the "click .selector": "function"  syntax, you're using event delegation - a very powerful (and simple!) concept.
[09:53:45] <dimi1947> meaning...all  this time I used event delegation and I did not know it
[09:53:50] <Booter> hello, anybody can say me why this simple script is not running when i click the button? (test.php just do an 'echo "hello world"): http://pastebin.com/index/3gaaWpYi
[09:54:02] <robertmaxrees> dimi1947 except that your el: $('body') is wrong.
[09:54:05] <robertmaxrees> which was probably breaking things.
[09:54:14] <Booter> http://pastebin.com/7L0GuKFe
[09:54:47] <dimi1947> why do you say that?
[09:54:53] <dimi1947> it is important
[09:55:02] <robertmaxrees> dimi1947 because it should be el: 'body'
[09:55:25] <robertmaxrees> backbone "caches" a jquery version of that object in this.$el for you.
[09:56:06] <dimi1947> and what is bad with it?
[09:56:24] <dimi1947> is it a performance issue?
[09:56:25] <robertmaxrees> dimi1947 backbone expects the el object to just be a selector.
[09:56:28] <robertmaxrees> just a string.
[09:56:30] <robertmaxrees> not a jkquery object.
[09:56:40] <robertmaxrees> so things sometimes won't work the way you expect them to.
[09:56:49] <robertmaxrees> Booter don't use onclick like that :(
[09:57:14] <Booter> robertmaxrees, then how can i execute the script?
[09:57:16] <dimi1947> oh,,,that is clear now
[09:57:33] <Booter> i need do this when the user clicks the button
[09:57:40] <robertmaxrees> Booter using .on()
[09:58:26] <Booter> i have another examples who works like this, but this example isn't working robertmaxrees
[09:58:34] <robertmaxrees> it's a bad way to do it, Booter
[09:59:05] <Booter> okey
[09:59:39] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/82r6r2hk/ you want something like this.
[09:59:53] <robertmaxrees> use a data attribute for your special URL and then pull from that in your event handler.
[10:07:36] <Booter> robertmaxrees, this still not working http://pastebin.com/7wxAU1y4
[10:07:49] <robertmaxrees> ...
[10:08:00] <robertmaxrees> don't generate js with PHP like that
[10:08:32] <Booter> oh sorry i don't saw your link
[10:08:45] <Booter> i go to read thanks
[10:16:35] <Booter> robertmaxrees, your script is not working :(
[10:16:48] <robertmaxrees> it's not going to work out of the box.
[10:16:53] <robertmaxrees> check your console and network tab.
[10:36:41] <k-joseph> cleared :-)
[10:38:50] <robertmaxrees> (boom)\
[10:55:53] <mrkie> i'm looking for a script like jquery datatables/jtable that has got the option to display the remaining amount of records (numeric) of a column that is not in the front of the page of that moment, like a pricewatch, you search for every computer in the color black, then you have a category on the page like hp that will change to hp (20), which means that there are 20 hp computers that are black
[10:56:03] <mrkie> hp would be a record in the database which is in the column named Brand, it should have another column Color with 20 records black
[11:25:30] <robertmaxrees> that feeling when you do a refactor in a few hours.
[11:40:11] <converge> Im doing this ajax call https://gist.github.com/converge/813dbdf4654d190a16c1
[11:40:25] <converge> but I can't get the arguments on my php function, am I doing something wrong ?
[11:41:28] <NoiseEee> why are you redefining "quantity" converge?
[11:41:41] <NoiseEee> and why not use jquery methods to get the value of a form field
[11:41:42] <converge> NoiseEee: to be more clear
[11:41:58] <NoiseEee> overwriting a passed in parameter straight away does not make things clear
[11:42:16] <NoiseEee> also what does "can't get the arguments on my php function" mean
[11:42:18] <converge> NoiseEee: cause its not a form, it's a button that get value from an input field
[11:42:25] <robertmaxrees> that's really confusing.
[11:42:57] <NoiseEee> "quantity" is a button converge?
[11:43:47] <converge> I have this page, with 10 products, every <div> product </div> has its own <input> field and a button, when click at the button, it gets the <input> value
[11:44:11] <NoiseEee> hmmm, why would a button need to get the value of an input?
[11:44:14] <converge> NoiseEee: quantity is the value inside the <input>
[11:45:07] <NoiseEee> converge: ... but not until line 5 though right?  so i'd rename your "quantity" parameter to be something that describes what you're actually passing; something like "formInput"
[11:45:23] <converge> NoiseEee: in this way, I make this ajax call, add the product at the order table(db)
[11:46:19] <NoiseEee> i get the purpose converge, make the code clearer/more explicit, don't overname variables/passed parameters
[11:46:35] <NoiseEee> anyways, what does "can't get the arguments on my php function" mean
[11:47:57] <converge> NoiseEee: ok. after the ajax call, addToCart(foo1, foo2) is passed, when I try to read foo1 and foo2, they're null
[11:48:26] <pauled> Hi, I want to store form data in localstorage associated with a button like witting a bookmark
[11:48:45] <NoiseEee> converge: whats your PHP code / how is it receiving the ajax post?
[11:48:45] <pauled> I mean a restor button
[11:49:25] <converge> NoiseEee: https://gist.github.com/converge/aae004c770b13d12feaf
[11:50:00] <NoiseEee> converge: before that.  what is calling addToCart
[11:50:21] <converge> NoiseEee: only the ajax call
[11:50:42] <converge> that's here https://gist.github.com/converge/813dbdf4654d190a16c1
[11:50:48] <NoiseEee> converge: i don't get it, how does your receiving php script even know to call addToCart() ?
[11:52:15] <converge> NoiseEee: what you mean.. ?
[11:52:42] <NoiseEee> converge: are you posting to an API?
[11:52:58] <converge> NoiseEee: yes, im using cakephp
[11:53:28] <NoiseEee> converge: well that php function is going to have to decode what's been sent to it.  take your issue to #cakePHP or something
[11:55:26] <converge> NoiseEee: ok, ill check that. maybe I need to decore
[11:55:37] <converge> NoiseEee: did you see something bad at my code or logic ?
[11:57:34] <NoiseEee> converge: i don't know how CakePHP works, but surely you need to pass in the data from the XHR call into the function somewhere
[12:01:32] <Sal> e correct way to scroll the page to elements ?
[12:02:03] <Sal> scrolltop to element_offset_top?
[12:13:59] <mducharme> good afternoon, I'm having a bit of an issue (I am a programmer, but have done exceedingly little with javascript)
[12:14:12] <robertmaxrees> shoot
[12:15:51] <mducharme> my site uses the jquery.isotope javascript for sorting, it works really nicely. However recently I have used a plugin in wordpress called "advanced ajax page loader", what it basically does is it makes your site content in a specifically named <div> load up via ajax so that the header and footer don't need to reload. The jquery.isotope sorting no longer works if you browse away from the page
[12:15:51] <mducharme> and go back.
[12:16:15] <mducharme> I believe it is a timing issue, since jquery gets the information from the HTML and the HTML is not there at first while ajax is busy loading it up
[12:17:12] <mducharme> I would need to somehow reinitialize the jquery.isotope after the page content loads
[12:17:26] <mducharme> but I'm not sure how to go about doing that
[12:17:58] <robertmaxrees> the ajax page loader should have a callback of some kind you can hook into.
[12:22:03] <mducharme> robertmaxrees yes it does, there is a reload code where I can put the code to run on the page reload
[12:22:11] <robertmaxrees> there you go!
[12:22:15] <mducharme> but I don't actually know what code to put in is the problem :)
[12:22:26] <robertmaxrees> the code to initialize isotope
[12:22:51] <mducharme> right except that isotope was already included in my site template and was running before, I didn't do the initial coding, so I don't know what code I need to use to initialize it
[12:23:37] <robertmaxrees> right, so you'll need to go to the isotope docs and look to see how you'd initialize it.
[12:24:35] <robertmaxrees> yeah - http://isotope.metafizzy.co/#initialize-with-jquery
[12:30:39] <mducharme> robertmaxrees yeah I'm close to having it working now I think
[12:31:45] <mducharme> oh
[12:31:49] <mducharme> it's isotope v1
[12:31:56] <mducharme> I bet it uses a different initialization routine
[12:34:08] <pauled> I am looking for a userscript that save form data in localStorage and and prompt for name to write a button 'restore'
[12:35:07] <robertmaxrees> pauled why not write it yourself?
[12:35:30] <pauled> no skill :'(
[12:35:46] <robertmaxrees> then learn :)
[12:36:02] <pauled> no brain :'(
[12:36:21] <pauled> no monney :'(
[12:36:39] <Uhkis> but a lot of self pity!
[12:36:49] <robertmaxrees> i learned to code and didn't spend any money on it.
[12:37:05] <robertmaxrees> lots of free resources - plus you'll be more sulf-sufficient!
[12:37:56] <pauled> I tried, and I figured out it's very hard to understand how to do that
[12:38:30] <robertmaxrees> so you expect somebody else to do it for you?
[12:39:41] <pauled> no, I am asking if there is already something like that on internet
[12:39:58] <robertmaxrees> that's a simple enough task that there probably isn't.
[12:41:03] <robertmaxrees> well, except for the amount of work that you'd have to put in to make something like that work with any semblance of reliability accross sites.
[12:55:26] <bigmac> im not sure why this jsfiddle is not working... http://jsfiddle.net/XFcSv/571/
[12:56:32] <robertmaxrees> what's supposed to happen?
[12:56:35] <bigmac> div class="carousel", im trying to add or removeattr("id","homeCarousel")
[12:56:40] <bigmac> when scrolls into view
[12:56:58] <robertmaxrees> $('#carousel').each(function() {}) doesn't do what you think it does.
[12:57:11] <bigmac> that is what it seems
[12:57:37] <robertmaxrees> i'm not seeing anything with that ID on the page.
[12:58:21] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/XFcSv/573/ is closer to what you want.
[12:58:33] <robertmaxrees> but that won't work either, because $('#homeCarousel').carousel(); won't "update"
[12:59:00] <robertmaxrees> why not just target the class and initialize them all on pageload?
[12:59:11] <bigmac> <div class="carousel">
[12:59:27] <robertmaxrees> you mean $('.carousel'), not $('#carousel')
[12:59:28] <bigmac> <div id="homeCarousel" class="carousel">
[12:59:32] <robertmaxrees> # is for IDs, . is for classes.
[13:01:18] <robertmaxrees> you're confused about how these things work.
[13:01:26] <bigmac> yes i am lol
[13:01:46] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/XFcSv/574/ here's where the IDs are getting added removed.
[13:01:51] <bigmac> i have found a example, that is working... and trying to implement into my gallery scroll
[13:01:53] <robertmaxrees> but notice how your carousels still aren't working?
[13:02:36] <bigmac> ?
[13:02:50] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/XFcSv/574/
[13:03:14] <robertmaxrees> this adds/removes the ID correctly, but the carousels still don't work,.
[13:03:55] <bigmac> http://jsfiddle.net/vVaat/63/
[13:04:03] <bigmac> this is the example im trying to implement
[13:04:19] <robertmaxrees> right, that has nothing to do with initializing carousels.
[13:04:35] <bigmac> im missing something
[13:04:37] <robertmaxrees> right.
[13:04:44] <robertmaxrees> $('#homeCarousel').carousel(); only runs when the page loads.
[13:04:50] <robertmaxrees> so adding that ID won't work.
[13:05:14] <bigmac> oh,
[13:05:29] <robertmaxrees> why are you trying to do this in the first place?
[13:06:10] <bigmac> i have 30 of these galleries running on my page all at once, as you scroll down i hope to enable the gallery one at a time
[13:06:15] <robertmaxrees> why?
[13:07:04] <robertmaxrees> it's prudent to point out that you should generally avoid carousels these days.  if you're really stuck on doing this, initialize them all and pause them all instead.
[13:07:40] <bigmac> start and pause button, will prevent loads of problems?
[13:07:51] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[13:09:01] <bigmac> with 30 of these galleries, i would have to define them as $('#homeCarousel*').carousel({
[13:09:08] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[13:09:11] <robertmaxrees> no you wouldn't.
[13:10:10] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/XFcSv/575/
[13:11:59] <robertmaxrees> but i'
[13:12:05] <bigmac> oh, i see
[13:12:15] <robertmaxrees> *i'd really encourage you to check out http://shouldiuseacarousel.com/ and question using a carousel at all.
[13:16:57] <mducharme> hrm robertmaxrees I'm still working on the problem
[13:17:16] <mducharme> it looks like all the code that initializes the grid initially with all the correct settings is in a particular .js file
[13:17:45] <mducharme> rather than having to have duplicate code someplace else, is there a way to have javascript execute javascript from some other .js file
[13:17:48] <mducharme> there must be
[13:17:53] <arc_> i disagree with this site
[13:18:58] <arc_> they only talk about interactions. the only point of a carousel is not just to get people to click
[13:19:15] <arc_> the only point of a website is not just to get people to click either
[13:20:38] <mducharme> ahh.. jquery.getscript
[13:21:54] <bigmac> carousel's, the information is missed ?
[13:24:24] <mducharme> hrm
[13:24:30] <mducharme> jQuery.getscript doesn't seem to work :(
[13:25:10] <rcyr> It's getScript
[13:25:20] <rcyr> Also, do you get any kind of errors in your console?
[13:25:58] <mducharme> no, none, and I had it properly cased I just typed it in the wrong case here on IRC...
[13:26:46] <rcyr> Can you see a new <script> node in the html panel?
[13:27:57] <mducharme> no
[13:29:01] <mducharme> I'm checking right now to see if maybe it puts it inside some other .js file
[13:29:06] <mducharme> maybe an autogenerated one
[13:29:48] <mducharme> it's always such a nightmare debugging someone else's code
[13:29:54] <mducharme> especially when I hardly understand javascript
[13:35:45] <mducharme> ahh I found it rcyr
[13:35:55] <mducharme> it puts it into this auto generated .js file
[13:35:55] <rcyr> Ah, great :)
[13:36:03] <mducharme> which was always there
[13:36:12] <mducharme> that's why there is no new <script> directive
[13:36:15] <mducharme> I figured it was something like that
[13:36:19] <mducharme> the question is now, why is it not doing anything
[13:36:36] <mducharme> I do not even know how to debug javascript
[13:36:51] <mducharme> I have turned on what debugging I can but don't see any errors
[13:36:55] <mducharme> I do have firebug and stuff installed
[13:37:25] <rcyr> You could try to add some console.log('lol') inside the script and see if they get executed
[13:43:44] <mducharme> yes, the word lol is appearing in the console
[13:44:11] <mducharme> and at the right time
[13:49:09] <mducharme> hrm rcyr
[13:49:16] <mducharme> it seems like I'm not getting an error from getScript
[13:49:26] <mducharme> even if I change the filename to something that doesn't exist, it's not throwing an error
[13:49:32] <mducharme> or maybe it is but I'm not seeing it
[13:56:35] <robertmaxrees> iirc 404s don't throw errors.
[13:56:39] <robertmaxrees> i could have that wrong though.
[14:02:41] <Aboba> Quick Q: What am I doing wrong? $('a[href$=".jpg"]').append('<img src="' + $(this).attr("href") + '"/>);
[14:02:58] <Aboba> The href is returning undefined
[14:03:19] <robertmaxrees> unless you're in a function, $(this) isn't what you think it is.
[14:03:20] <Aboba> I'm trying to take any jpg link, and append the image
[14:03:28] <Aboba> ah, okay
[14:03:33] <robertmaxrees> you need to use .each() in that case.
[14:03:41] <Aboba> thank you
[14:04:22] <robertmaxrees> yep
[14:04:50] <DragonPunch> :)
[14:04:59] <DragonPunch> i just fixed 2week long jquery prob
[14:05:05] <robertmaxrees> awesome!  what was it?
[14:05:08] <DragonPunch> i only had to remove 1 line.
[14:05:10] <drej> he spelled jquery wrong
[14:05:16] <robertmaxrees> drej++
[14:05:21] <DragonPunch> it was a contentEditable thing.
[14:05:26] <DragonPunch> o m g.
[14:05:28] <robertmaxrees> fair enough
[14:05:29] <drej> contentEdible
[14:05:33] <drej> nom
[14:05:58] <DragonPunch> jquery is no match for us humans.
[14:06:00] <DragonPunch> ^_^
[14:06:36] <robertmaxrees> excited to go home in an hour!
[14:06:57] <drej> robertmaxrees: i got home an hour ago
[14:07:01] <drej> wait, arent you american, isnt it holiday?
[14:07:13] <robertmaxrees> it's a holiday, but my company doesn't take everything off.
[14:07:19] <robertmaxrees> we only get like 4 days off.
[14:07:36] <drej> uh i thought it was a national holiday
[14:07:39] <drej> its against the law for you to work
[14:07:42] <robertmaxrees> LOL
[14:07:45] <robertmaxrees> we don't have those.
[14:07:48] <drej> laws?
[14:07:59] <robertmaxrees> holidays where it's  illegal to work.
[14:08:06] <drej> federal holidays are those
[14:08:18] <robertmaxrees> if you're a federal employee, you usually get the day off.
[14:08:20] <drej> i guess today is not one of those
[14:08:24] <mducharme> hrm even if I execute something that doesn't exist it throws an error
[14:08:33] <mducharme> meaning call a function or whatever that doesn't exist
[14:08:33] <robertmaxrees> drej er, there's no such concept in the US.
[14:08:41] <drej> sure there is
[14:08:41] <robertmaxrees> there are no holidays where it's *illegal* to work.
[14:08:53] <drej> if you're a sallaried employee, federal holidays are mandatory
[14:08:56] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[14:08:57] <robertmaxrees> not in the US.
[14:09:15] <drej> so if your employer decided to do so, he can make you work jan 1st?
[14:09:18] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[14:09:21] <robertmaxrees> or christmas eve.
[14:09:27] <drej> why the fuck does anyone live in that fucked up country then?
[14:09:28] <robertmaxrees> or thanksgiving.  i have done all of those.
[14:09:30] <drej> you're all basically slaves
[14:09:41] <robertmaxrees> apparently.
[14:09:43] <drej> you dont get compensated in exchaneg?
[14:09:45] <drej> exchange
[14:09:48] <drej> like you get to take another day off
[14:09:49] <drej> instead
[14:09:52] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[14:09:57] <robertmaxrees> i get decent amounts of PTO.
[14:10:05] <robertmaxrees> i could've taken today off if I'd wanted.
[14:10:17] <robertmaxrees> but it would've been for paid time off.  it's like any other day.
[14:11:59] <drej> wow
[14:11:59] <drej> The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) does not require payment for time not worked, such as vacations or holidays (federal or otherwise). These benefits are generally a matter of agreement between an employer and an employee (or the employee's representative).
[14:12:03] <drej> you guys are slaves
[14:12:04] <drej> that's crazy
[14:12:22] <robertmaxrees> hahahahaha
[14:12:34] <drej> that fucking boggles my mind man
[14:12:39] <drej> nowhere else in the world is that the case
[14:12:43] <drej> shit, in INDIA you get paid holidays
[14:12:44] <robertmaxrees> i'm aware.
[14:12:47] <robertmaxrees> well aware.
[14:12:53] <drej> robertmaxrees: so uhmm want a job here or what
[14:12:57] <robertmaxrees> nope :)
[14:13:04] <drej> so, not only are you all slaves
[14:13:05] <robertmaxrees> i make plenty, get plenty of PTO, and like it here ;)
[14:13:06] <drej> you're also all nuts
[14:13:12] <drej> whats plenty of PTO
[14:13:16] <drej> like 2 weeks
[14:13:16] <robertmaxrees> paid time off.
[14:13:19] <drej> i know what it stands for
[14:13:23] <drej> but how much is "plenty"
[14:13:24] <robertmaxrees> i can't remember what rate i acrue at.
[14:13:30] <robertmaxrees> my company gives me more and more as time goes on.
[14:13:39] <drej> sure, but i bet you its like what 3 weeks?
[14:13:44] <drej> that's nothing
[14:13:50] <robertmaxrees> i don't remember.  i never really take time in the first palce.
[14:13:52] <robertmaxrees> *place
[14:14:11] <drej> what if you coul dmake just as much, if not more, have your holidays paid for AND get free healthcare?
[14:14:16] <drej> and have more PTO
[14:14:17] <robertmaxrees> lol
[14:14:32] <drej> cuz that's canada for ya
[14:14:49] <drej> and the beer's better.
[14:14:50] <robertmaxrees> we can take it to ##frontend or PM if you want.
[14:14:53] <drej> lol
[14:15:08] <drej> i'll stop derailing the lots of on-topic discussion in here
[14:15:09] <drej> my bad
[14:15:11] <robertmaxrees> lol
[14:15:21] <robertmaxrees> i just have some... interesting opinions about the whole thing.
[14:18:12] <gtristan> Ummm... is there a trick I can use in jquery to define a style programatically ?
[14:18:25] <robertmaxrees> not css.
[14:18:26] <gtristan> like to .append() a <style> node somewhere
[14:18:35] <robertmaxrees> not without some gross hacks.
[14:18:35] <hd1> hmm... my mouseover isn't being triggered (again) :( http://hasan.d8u.us/links.js it's supposed to be triggered on http://links.d8u.us/
[14:18:40] * hd1 frowns
[14:19:19] <gtristan> hmmm, so thats not a thing I can just do ? add a <style> node somewhere and have it apply to the children in the DOM ?
[14:19:29] <robertmaxrees> gtristan not reliably, to.
[14:19:32] <robertmaxrees> *no
[14:19:52] <gtristan> I can deal with not reliably, how ugly is it ?
[14:20:00] <robertmaxrees> exactly what you think it is.
[14:20:01] <gtristan> I mean, it's just to set a contextual color
[14:20:19] <gtristan> (so if the browser doesnt do it, what the hell)
[14:20:20] <robertmaxrees> errr... thjen just add/remove classes and specify in your actual css.
[14:20:33] <gtristan> no, the color itself comes from a database
[14:20:37] <gtristan> it's not defined in any css
[14:20:55] <gtristan> and I have a simple style which applies the color to a bunch of sub-elements
[14:20:56] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[14:21:16] <robertmaxrees> hd1 dunno - what have you tried?/
[14:21:22] <gtristan> it's the color the user chose for a given category of items
[14:21:45] <mducharme> hrm
[14:21:59] <mducharme> I know the solution here has to be simple.. I would really appreciate if someone could take a look
[14:22:04] <robertmaxrees> mducharme at what?
[14:23:05] <mducharme> my issue.. I think I'm just not triggering the code in the correct way
[14:23:44] <hd1> robertmaxrees: I put a breakpoint in JS using Safari inside the mouseover and it wasn't triggered
[14:23:56] <robertmaxrees> hd1 right.
[14:23:59] <robertmaxrees> do you see why?
[14:24:09] <mducharme> it is on a public site so it is visible: http://michaeljducharme.com/?page_id=64
[14:24:52] <robertmaxrees> err.
[14:25:01] <hd1> no, I don't
[14:25:08] <robertmaxrees> hd1 your selector is bad.
[14:25:16] <robertmaxrees> mducharme can you make a test case instead?
[14:25:18] <hd1> but my guess is that I'm a moron, but there must be something aside from that
[14:25:26] <mducharme> the filters work when you go directly to the page at first (filters are based on jquery.isotope) but then when navigating around and going back to the "works" page the filters do not work
[14:25:35] <mducharme> test case?
[14:25:53] <mducharme> I don't know what that means
[14:26:16] <robertmaxrees> http://css-tricks.com/reduced-test-cases/
[14:27:05] <robertmaxrees> and i explained this earlier - you need to reinitialize isotope.
[14:27:29] <mducharme> robertmaxrees yes I figured out how to do that and then the boxes went flying all over the place and were no longer aligned like they are by default
[14:28:06] <robertmaxrees> uh,.
[14:28:08] <robertmaxrees> then fix that?
[14:28:13] <mducharme> reinitializing isotope works, but then all the boxes are sitting on top of each other
[14:28:23] <mducharme> I want them to look like they are by default
[14:28:26] <mducharme> how?
[14:28:37] <robertmaxrees> what's the container you initialize on?
[14:29:05] <mducharme> the built in core.compiled.js does the initialize for me
[14:29:08] <mducharme> it's built into the theme
[14:29:15] <robertmaxrees> ...
[14:29:16] <robertmaxrees> okay?
[14:29:17] <mducharme> this was already all coded, I am trying to figure this out
[14:29:36] <robertmaxrees> how were you reinitializing before then?
[14:30:50] <mducharme> before there was no ajax, just a series of pages, so the built in core.compiled.js did the initialization on the page load
[14:31:15] <robertmaxrees> " <mducharme> robertmaxrees yes I figured out how to do that and then the boxes went flying all over the place and were no longer aligned like they are by default"
[14:31:18] <mducharme> it has all the initialization comamnds for isotope inside it
[14:31:19] <robertmaxrees> this is what i'm referencing.
[14:31:32] <robertmaxrees> right, you need to copy those and re-run them after the ajax runs.
[14:31:50] <hd1> now it's not recognising endsWith
[14:31:52] <mducharme> robertmaxrees - I understand that but was trying to find a way of doing it without actually duplicating the code in two places
[14:32:07] <robertmaxrees> mducharme you don't really have that choice at this point.
[14:32:14] <mducharme> I'd ideally like to simply call the code in the original location
[14:32:15] <robertmaxrees> because this is all precompiled you have to do that.
[14:32:19] <mducharme> oh
[14:32:20] <robertmaxrees> mducharme you can't.
[14:32:23] * hd1 wants to get rid of all these bloody anonymous functions
[14:32:50] <robertmaxrees> hd1 huh?
[14:33:45] <mducharme> robertmaxrees - ok, thanks for the explanation - that explains why I can't get this working
[14:33:45] <robertmaxrees> hd1 you're aware endsWith isn't necessarily reliable, right?
[14:33:50] <jqueryhelp> Hello all
[14:34:06] <robertmaxrees> mducharme sure - welcome to javascript :)
[14:34:31] <mducharme> robertmaxrees - one further question I wanted to ask about.. if the .js file is "compiled" how come it seems to be plain text?
[14:34:38] <jqueryhelp> I need do click in a button and send a value when onclick, but: Is it possible in jquery?
[14:34:38] <mducharme> when I compile C code I get a binary
[14:34:48] <robertmaxrees> mducharme by "compiled" i mean "it's all in one file"
[14:34:53] <mducharme> oh
[14:34:58] <robertmaxrees> without editing that file, you can't do what you want.
[14:35:03] <robertmaxrees> jqueryhelp yes.
[14:35:21] <jqueryhelp> Ok, How can I do that?
[14:35:26] <robertmaxrees> start here: https://learn.jquery.com/events/event-basics/
[14:35:41] <jqueryhelp> I have in jquery: $("button").click(function(){
[14:35:44] <mducharme> robertmaxrees - ahh, yeah, that's why I was trying to re-execute the entire compiled .js file
[14:35:47] <mducharme> but that didn't seem to work
[14:35:53] <robertmaxrees> mducharme that's a really bad idea in general.
[14:36:09] <robertmaxrees> you end up re-binding listeners and creating memory leaks like that.
[14:36:53] <jqueryhelp> In HTML: <input type="button" value="V" class="mostrar-ocultar" />
[14:37:06] <robertmaxrees> !paste @ jqueryhelp
[14:37:12] <robertmaxrees> awww broken bot.
[14:37:26] <robertmaxrees> jqueryhelp share your code in a jsfiddle or fixee or somethingelse.
[14:37:49] <jqueryhelp> Okkk :)
[14:40:06] <hd1> robertmaxrees: clearly not... what should I use?
[14:40:28] <robertmaxrees> hd1 you could use .indexOf()
[14:40:42] <robertmaxrees> myString.indexOf('substring') > -1
[14:42:39] <nerium> Anyone knows a lib like selectorgadget (https://github.com/cantino/selectorgadget) used to select elements on a page?
[14:43:00] <robertmaxrees> hd1 for what it's worth, breaking the problem down and using jsfiddle for the individual broken pieces is generally preferred.
[14:43:31] <robertmaxrees> nerium huh?  isn't that what selectorgadget does?
[14:43:53] <nerium> robertmaxrees: Yes, but I need something simpler
[14:44:02] <robertmaxrees> nerium not sure i understand.
[14:44:06] <robertmaxrees> what isn't simple about it?
[14:44:31] <nerium> robertmaxrees: I need to ability to hover over an element and copy itâ€™s text
[14:44:42] <jqueryhelp> This is my code: https://jsfiddle.net/8fa4kmmk/
[14:44:48] <robertmaxrees> nerium you can use your dev tools to do that.
[14:45:07] <nerium> robertmaxrees: I need it on my web page
[14:45:10] <robertmaxrees> jqueryhelp btw you didn't include jquery.
[14:45:29] <robertmaxrees> jqueryhelp so there are a few issues.
[14:45:30] <jqueryhelp> I want to do click on first button and show hide first div, and successively
[14:45:39] <robertmaxrees> $("button").click(function(myParameterSend){}); will never work.
[14:46:08] <jqueryhelp> Yes I know
[14:46:34] <robertmaxrees> jqueryhelp so how are you tying each button back to a div?
[14:46:35] <jqueryhelp> I invented this parameter myParameterSend
[14:46:51] <robertmaxrees> you cannot do that with .click() - it specifies what parameters you can use.
[14:47:32] <jqueryhelp> My update: https://jsfiddle.net/8fa4kmmk/1/
[14:47:45] <robertmaxrees> how are you tying each button back to a div?
[14:48:10] <robertmaxrees> also, you forgot to include jquery again - i included it here for you: https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/8fa4kmmk/2/
[14:48:20] <hd1> robertmaxrees: I'm not sure WHERE the breakage is, the thing was simply not being called
[14:49:59] <jqueryhelp> I don't know, in javascript it was easy, when I did click on a button in this button I created an even onclick and I sent a value, this value I got on javascript code and I could know what div show/hide
[14:50:39] <jqueryhelp> robertmaxrees Thanks :)
[14:51:36] <jqueryhelp> And in jQuery I haven't any idea :(
[14:53:56] <mducharme> one remaining problem, robertmaxrees
[14:54:07] <mducharme> that display issue is there
[14:54:21] <mducharme> everything is on top of each other until clicking on one of the filters, then everything looks fine
[14:54:54] <mducharme> it must be some sort of a weird timing issue
[14:57:32] <mducharme> it is working now besides that though
[14:57:34] <mducharme> only have to get that fixed
[15:00:31] <robertmaxrees> link?
[15:01:15] <hd1> robertmaxrees: is $(this) valid outside anonymous functions?
[15:01:34] <robertmaxrees> hd1 $(this) is valid anywhere, but the 'this' object changes depending on some factors.
[15:01:54] <mducharme> robertmaxrees: http://www.michaeljducharme.com  and click on 'Works' at the top
[15:02:18] <mducharme> if you go directly to the 'Works' page URL it loads fine because that doesn't have to load up through ajax
[15:02:36] <mducharme> but if you go to it from the main site it loads through ajax and then the icons are on top of each other until you click a filter
[15:03:07] <robertmaxrees> jqueryhelp https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/8fa4kmmk/3/ this is closer to what you want.
[15:03:31] <robertmaxrees> mducharme it seemed to load fine for me.
[15:03:39] <robertmaxrees> let me try again.
[15:03:55] <robertmaxrees> oh you didn't put the JS back in did you?
[15:05:01] <mducharme> yes the JS is there
[15:05:11] <mducharme> why
[15:05:15] <robertmaxrees> the new stuff that re-initializes isotope?
[15:05:20] <mducharme> yes
[15:05:33] <robertmaxrees> i'm not seeing it fire.
[15:06:34] <mducharme> robertmaxrees - it works here in IE and firefox so it must be firing
[15:06:39] <hd1> robertmaxrees: i'm trying to deanonymise the code, as i think it's cleaner
[15:06:48] <robertmaxrees> hd1 good?
[15:06:49] <mducharme> it is in an auto generated .js file called reload_code.js
[15:06:52] <robertmaxrees> mducharme i'm in firefox.
[15:06:57] <robertmaxrees> so i'm not sure what the issue is.
[15:07:01] <hd1> and it seems $(this) isn't what it is in a non-anonymous function
[15:07:02] <mducharme> you can see the .js file if you view source
[15:07:20] <hd1> the current file is at http://hasan.d8u.us/links.js
[15:07:26] <mducharme> robertmaxrees - are the filter buttons working for you? if they are, that means that the reload_code.js stuff is running
[15:07:35] <robertmaxrees> mducharme no, they're not.
[15:07:45] <mducharme> oh
[15:07:47] <robertmaxrees> hd1 i'm not going to keep looking at your entire file.  sorry.
[15:07:50] <hd1> console.log on line 15 is printing nothing
[15:07:52] <robertmaxrees> if oyu have specific questions, let me know.
[15:08:10] <robertmaxrees> hd1 because  $('.link a').bind("mouseover", mouseOver($(this))); doesn't work.
[15:08:15] <mducharme> hmm robertmaxrees - if you went to the page like 15 minutes ago, I wonder if your browser has cached the .js file
[15:08:23] <mducharme> maybe a shift reload?
[15:08:23] <robertmaxrees> mducharme i cleared cache
[15:08:25] <mducharme> oh
[15:08:25] <robertmaxrees> hd1 $('.link a').on("mouseover", mouseOver);
[15:08:32] <robertmaxrees> mducharme i AM a professional developer ;)
[15:09:02] <mducharme> hrm this is completely strange
[15:09:10] <mducharme> why would it be working for me and not for you
[15:09:14] <robertmaxrees> the page loads fine for me, but the links don't.
[15:09:25] <robertmaxrees> *the links don't work, that is.
[15:09:35] <jqueryhelp> Than you very much :)
[15:09:41] <robertmaxrees> mducharme why not ditch the ajax plugin, btw?
[15:09:47] <robertmaxrees> seems silly to keep it in this case.
[15:10:02] <jqueryhelp> Can I do using onclick?
[15:10:18] <robertmaxrees> jqueryhelp like in your html?
[15:11:23] <mducharme> robertmaxrees - the music player at the bottom
[15:11:34] <mducharme> it will autoplay while people are browsing my site
[15:11:44] <mducharme> I don't want it to restart playing every time people go to the new page
[15:11:52] <mducharme> that's the reason for the ajax
[15:12:36] <robertmaxrees> i wouldn't have that widget in the first place fwiw.
[15:13:08] <mducharme> hmm?
[15:13:23] <robertmaxrees> autoplaying music is very distracting.  send them to a page with music samples instead imo.
[15:13:43] <robertmaxrees> if you really want the widget, rip isotope out of your backend and manually do everything for it yourself.
[15:13:49] <robertmaxrees> including the stuff for initial pageload.
[15:13:51] <mducharme> robertmaxrees - every film composer I know has autoplaying music on their site when you go to the main page
[15:14:06] <robertmaxrees> mducharme that doens't make it a good idea ;0
[15:14:14] <nerium> Anyone knows a plugin for selecting text like this? http://odyniec.net/projects/imgareaselect/
[15:14:31] <nerium> Instead of cropping an image text in html should be selected
[15:14:51] <robertmaxrees> nerium you'll have a hard time finding a plugin that does that.  what do you need it for?
[15:15:03] <mducharme> robertmaxrees - I am a composer
[15:15:10] <mducharme> if people go to my site it will be for my music
[15:15:11] <robertmaxrees> mducharme okay?
[15:15:19] <robertmaxrees> lol
[15:15:19] <nerium> robertmaxrees: To make it easier to select text on a page
[15:15:30] <mducharme> it's not like if you go to some corporate website and you get music and you weren't expecting it, that is annoying
[15:15:33] <robertmaxrees> mducharme either way, you'll need to manually handle it all for yourself.
[15:16:31] <mducharme> ahh robertmaxrees I found the problem why it wasn't working for you, I accidentally turned off this "jquery check"
[15:16:37] <robertmaxrees> nerium why can't you just click+drag ?
[15:16:39] <mducharme> if you could reload again
[15:17:18] <nerium> robertmaxrees: Not precice enough. Iâ€™ve a bunch of elements with are difficult to select
[15:17:24] <robertmaxrees> nerium huh?
[15:17:25] <mducharme> it must have cached it on my side so it was working.. I started up chrome, which I never use, and it did the same thing as yours, but then I re-enabled the "jquery check" (don't know what it does exactly) and now it works in chrome
[15:17:31] <robertmaxrees> nerium what's the use case?
[15:17:48] <robertmaxrees> mducharme same thing.
[15:17:57] <robertmaxrees> mducharme i'd really suggest hiring a developer at this point.
[15:18:06] <robertmaxrees> because you're going to end up fighting against this for a while.
[15:18:19] <nerium> robertmaxrees: Itâ€™s for an admin panel. The data being selected is processed
[15:18:29] <mducharme> I'm a student
[15:18:34] <mducharme> I'm severely in debt, no money for a developer
[15:18:51] <robertmaxrees> nerium that's ephemeral.  what's this text for?
[15:18:58] <mducharme> I'm just tryin gto get a nice website so I can get hired for things
[15:19:06] <robertmaxrees> mducharme what you're asking for at this point is outside of the realm of the format of this channel.
[15:19:14] <nerium> robertmaxrees: its processed and store in the db
[15:19:18] <nerium> *stored
[15:19:29] <robertmaxrees> nerium lol that's still nto helpful, but OK.  good luck :)
[15:19:42] <nerium> robertmaxrees: Iâ€™m not sure what you want
[15:20:01] <robertmaxrees> nerium i don't see why click+drag is insufficient.  and example would be killer at this point.
[15:20:10] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, your dev tools might be exactly what you want.
[15:20:26] <nerium> robertmaxrees: Iâ€™ll upload an example html, hold on
[15:21:49] <mducharme> robertmaxrees - ok.. I know.. I do really appreciate your help today, thank you
[15:22:02] <robertmaxrees> mducharme sure, good luck.
[15:22:09] <mducharme> I figured out what the problem is now I believe
[15:22:17] <nerium> robertmaxrees: http://oleander.io/index2.html Try selecting question #1
[15:22:23] <rockfruit> with var x=$(".some_class"), what is the meaning of this selector?:    $(".another_class", x)
[15:22:52] <nerium> robertmaxrees: On my machine the selector just jumps around and its not very percice
[15:22:54] <robertmaxrees> nerium i don't see a "question #1"
[15:23:08] <nerium> robertmaxrees: page 2?
[15:23:08] <robertmaxrees> rockfruit that.s the same as x.find('.another_class');
[15:23:12] <nerium> 1. â€¦
[15:23:18] <rockfruit> robertmaxrees thanks.
[15:23:22] <mducharme> yup, now I just need to fix it
[15:23:31] <rockfruit> I'm off to replace the lot now, with the less confusing notation
[15:23:47] <robertmaxrees> nerium ah.
[15:24:06] <robertmaxrees> nerium that's because of the markup on here - i assume you can't change that part?
[15:24:17] <nerium> robertmaxrees: Nope
[15:24:30] <nerium> robertmaxrees: Itâ€™s generated from a pdf
[15:27:01] <robertmaxrees> nerium then you're kind of SOL as far as I know.  you could try using your browser's dev tools.
[15:27:43] <nerium> robertmaxrees: I need a stand-alone solution
[15:28:04] <robertmaxrees> nerium yeah, you're going to have a hard time finding that, especially because this PDF uses images for certain things.
[15:28:29] <nerium> robertmaxrees: The html is fine. Everyting that can be plain text is
[15:28:50] <robertmaxrees> nerium actually, the html isn't - if it were more sensibly structured, you'd been good to go.
[15:29:00] <robertmaxrees> then you just need a way to select elements.
[15:29:24] <robertmaxrees> and you'd have one element's whose html() you'd need to grab for each question.  what do you plan on using this plain text for anyway?
[15:30:26] <hd1> fsck!
[15:33:21] <robertmaxrees> welp
[15:34:22] <EGreg> hi
[15:34:25] <EGreg> why is this happening: https://gist.github.com/EGreg/c1511468944981fd37eb
[15:34:39] <EGreg> The browser seems to represent the jQuery somehow as an array, but all the standard tests for an array fail
[15:34:45] <EGreg> why?
[15:35:46] <robertmaxrees> jquery is an array-like object
[15:36:06] <robertmaxrees> but it's an object.
[15:38:00] <robertmaxrees> EGreg does that make sense?
[15:39:27] <mducharme> yay robertmaxrees I have fixed it, the js file for isotope was only loading if the page itself loaded, I just needed to add it to the entire site
[15:39:40] <mducharme> I still have the issue with the display but at least that works now
[15:39:40] <robertmaxrees> mducharme ah.  there you go!
[15:40:04] <mducharme> if I can get that fixed everything will be working
[15:40:10] <robertmaxrees> awesome.
[15:42:44] <mducharme> I suspect the remaining display issue has to do with the fact that the js doesn't know what size screen things are on, it thinks the screen is too small and puts everything on top of each other
[15:46:43] <mducharme> yes.. if I even resize the window everything looks fine
[15:46:53] <mducharme> I wonder if there is a simple way I could call a redraw on the window
[15:54:55] <mducharme> the code is running right before the window resizes to the correct size
[15:58:14] <mducharme> haha, fixed it
[15:58:20] <mducharme> used SetTimeout
[15:58:54] <mducharme> fantastic
[15:59:10] <mducharme> it's a little bit of a hack, but it works
[16:01:07] <mducharme> thank you so much robertmaxrees
[16:01:09] <mducharme> everything works
[16:08:24] <EGreg> reading now
[16:08:35] <EGreg> robertmaxrees: yes of course it makes sense, but why does Chrome display it as an array
[18:26:49] <w09x> hey folks - is there a way to find the nearest element with say class="blah" ignoring any parent children stuff?.... find any element that is above a given element that has x "blah" class
[18:28:01] <SirLagz> w09x: but that's what the whole "parent children stuff" is...the closest element to something else
[18:28:51] <w09x> SirLagz: problem is I have a <li class="active">... I need to find the first element above it that has a data-toggle="collapse" attribute, any idea how?
[18:29:20] <w09x> i don't care where about's that attribute is, so long as it is the one that is previous to the active li
[18:31:16] <SirLagz> w09x: ah. Not sure about that then.
[19:18:49] <ISmithers> Is there a way to get the value from a file-upload control in jquery?
[19:30:41] <Xion_> Does jQuery support .then() on $() elements? Basically, I'd like $('#foo').fadeIn(123).delay(456).then(function() { /* stuff */ }).fadeOut(789), having the .fadeOut() be called after /* stuff */ finishes executing.
[19:31:57] <Xion_> Oh, apparently I can do $().promise() which is a promise for the animation result.
[19:44:56] <gtwy> where can i get started with jquery ui
[19:46:59] <crankharder> I'm looking for the class that gets added to the dragged item by sortable() but I can't find it here: http://api.jqueryui.com/sortable/
[19:47:16] <crankharder> that said, sortable() must add a bunch of different classes to different elements for different reasons - are they all defined in one place?
[22:08:06] <Booter> please i need help
[22:12:14] <VectorX> whats the problem
[22:13:19] <Booter> i want to change the value onclick event but i can't
[22:13:23] <Booter> it don't runs and i don't know why
[22:13:57] <Booter> is my second day trying to do this simple job and it not runs
[22:14:04] <Booter> u_u¡
[22:14:21] <VectorX> where is your fiddle ?
[22:14:49] <rindolf> Hi all.
[22:15:27] <Booter> not understand VectorX what do you want to say
[22:15:29] <Booter> fiddle?
[22:15:36] <Uhkis> demo?
[22:15:40] <Uhkis> oops
[22:15:42] <Uhkis> ?demo
[22:15:49] <Uhkis> oh, bot is dead
[22:16:06] <Uhkis> Booter: make a demo of your problem at http://jsfiddle.net/
[22:17:30] <Booter> Uhkis, http://jsfiddle.net/gLnywk0x/
[22:18:00] <Booter> reportURL.php just is doing this line in php: echo 'hello world';
[22:18:01] <VectorX> not a very smart one
[22:18:47] <Booter> the alert is not running too
[22:19:11] <VectorX> Booter it might help if you create a workable fiddle instead of having PHP in it
[22:19:30] <rindolf> Booter: you have a <?php directive there - that won't work in jsfiddle.net.
[22:22:38] <Booter> if i remove the ajax part then the alert is working
[22:22:47] <Booter> but i need ajax to run an external script
[22:22:59] <Booter> and change the value of the button
[22:57:52] <Cork> Booter: is the button inside "#spanErrorReport<?php echo $id_url;?>" ?
[23:10:12] <lintguy> Good mornin
[23:16:24] <jak2000> a small plugin for doo modal form?
