[00:10:26] <jak2000> derekZero_?
[00:11:14] <derekZero_> Sorry, I've been working on something.
[00:11:17] <derekZero_> I'll look
[00:12:11] <derekZero_> Do you want to decrease the opacity?
[00:14:20] <Xuster> $("html, body").delay(2000).animate({scrollTop: $('#content-full').offset().top }, 1000); this scroll me downs to the desired DIV but i need it to stop about 10px before it reaches the div, what do I need to look at?
[00:17:41] <jak2000> no no decrease
[00:17:54] <jak2000> call again the 5 blur events on the button event
[00:22:04] <derekZero_> jak2000 I havn't heard of a blur event, but you don't have anything in your function for .click.
[00:22:51] <derekZero_> It would be something like $(this).blur();
[00:23:01] <derekZero_> If that's a thing.
[00:33:16] <jak2000> ok
[00:35:55] <django_> is this proper jQuery: ('ol':last-child()).hide()
[01:51:28] <Zison> hi
[01:53:22] <jquery030> hello there
[01:54:34] <jquery030> i am trying to validate file type, i have three different file upload field, each having seprate extension, i would like to validate each upload file, but i am not able to do this so
[01:54:42] <jquery030> please help me
[02:05:41] <jquery030> anybody please
[02:08:27] <durwasa> jquery030, i dont know how to do this in jQuery but shall I tell you an alternate solution ?
[02:09:38] <durwasa> The file names usually have an extension at the end so filename.strip('.')[1] can get you the filename extension ... You can google the strip equivalent in jQuery
[02:11:10] <jquery030> durwasa: thank you, but will it work for all three fields
[02:12:03] <durwasa> jquery030, can you fiddle the code ?
[02:12:47] <jquery030> yea
[02:15:11] <durwasa> jquery030, three text fields like.pdf .txt .mp3 (lets say) so you can split the filename file.split('.')[Array.prototype.length+1]
[02:15:26] <durwasa> and then validate whether the fileformat is same or not
[02:15:59] <durwasa> I am very new to jQuery so thinking in the JS style ... so my apologies in advance :) :)
[02:58:41] <django_> http://jsfiddle.net/kf0bk44a/
[02:58:44] <django_> why is that wrong
[03:14:29] <arup_r> I want to append a li first and then inside li one <p>, how to do the chain properly. $("ul.user.circle-list").append("<li></li>").append("<p>hi</p>"")
[03:14:35] <arup_r> is not doing what I wamt
[03:36:53] <spikeheadon> I am using a jquery plugin in angular. The controller builds up a directive using $compile to append html into dom. The jquery plugin is supposed to interact with that element but its not working. Any ideas?
[03:36:53] <spikeheadon> I have initialized the jquery plugin in controller
[04:14:29] <lumidee> hi, (magnific popup question) can i use magnific popup also on mobile devices and only adjust the css by using media queries or do i have to use media queries and inject another inline popup code (e.g.: featherlight)?
[04:15:20] <arup_r> how can you abort an Ajax call ?
[04:16:12] <arup_r> thanks.. I know how to do it
[04:32:34] <lumidee> (i just use           disableOn: 700,     now)
[06:19:57] <durwasa> I was just playing with some variable scoping and jQuery ... Can anyone tell me what is wrong with this code ? https://jsfiddle.net/durwasa/2j4z76fk/
[06:32:29] <shoky_> durwasa: a few things.. you can't return stuff that originates from an asynchronous event handler, if you want something to happen after the event, do it inside the event handler.   also, $("#textarea").html(xyz);   is wrong, xyz is a function, you're passing a function to .html instead of a string. you wanted probably to call the function:  .html( xyz() )  but that'd still be wrong in your example because of the first issue i mentioned
[06:34:09] <shoky_> durwasa: also, you're doing the .change(..) call inside the xyz function,  meaning each time xyz is called it will add another event handler to the element. not what you want probably
[06:34:39] <shoky_> durwasa: also, to get the selected value from a <select> you can just get the .value of the select itself
[06:34:51] <shoky_> no need to loop through the options
[06:36:05] <shoky_> durwasa: and, to set the textarea's text you should set its value, not its inner html
[06:36:49] <shoky_> durwasa: https://jsfiddle.net/2j4z76fk/1/
[06:53:11] <durwasa> shoky_, :) :) thankyou so much
[06:54:56] <durwasa> shoky_, I dont remember bt i jst read somewhere maybe the jQuery documentation that passing function name without parens is passing the reference ... So, is it incorrect way to engage async event or it is something else ...
[06:59:38] <durwasa> shoky_, actually my first jQuery project I haven't written much of jQuery so my code is very unstrucutred in the sense ... So, I am reading whatever I am coming across... so the innerhtml was required because I am using various other functions which have some return value so I can easily append('text')
[08:32:50] <caraconan> Hi there. Any idea why the enhanceWithin() triggers the vclick on back button? http://jsfiddle.net/9Ljyoyfj/
[08:33:22] <caraconan> Hi have similar code which shows a google map, and the back button is enhanced and displayed as expected, but without triggering the vclick event...
[08:37:08] <robhol> Anybody have a clue as to why this returns 16 "undefineds"? Array(16).map((_, i) => i)
[08:45:45] <shoky`> robhol: .map only goes over indices in the array that have assigned values
[08:46:18] <robhol> ... but... but... [undefined, undefined].map( (_, i) => i) returns [0, 1]
[08:47:07] <shoky`> Array(2)  is an array of length 2  with no indices assigned to any value
[08:47:20] <shoky`> [undefined, undefined] is an array of length 2 with both indices assigned to the value undefined
[08:47:22] <shoky`> :P
[08:47:32] <robhol> ಠ_ಠ
[08:47:52] <shoky`> Array(2)  is just  []   with .length of 2
[08:48:08] <robhol> wat.
[08:48:17] <robhol> that is just... insane
[08:48:21] <shoky`> at least in chrome. nevermind really
[08:48:35] <robhol> in Firefox too
[08:50:03] <robhol> thanks for the answer btw :p
[08:51:20] <shoky`> np. ES6 has this btw -  new Array(5).fill(value)
[08:53:41] <robhol> cool. I was actually looking for "range"
[08:53:50] <robhol> [for (i of Array(16)) i ].map((_,i)=>i) works, but... is insane
[08:54:25] <robhol> new Array(n).fill(0).map((x,i)=>i) should do the same thing I imagine
[08:57:07] <caraconan> Apparently .enhancewithin() removes the trailing </img>, and maybe this is causing my issue: http://jsfiddle.net/w4qk1stb/ Any ideas?
[09:03:58] <codecutter> hi
[09:04:49] <codecutter> line 4 prints 'absolute' and line 6 is printing 'static' (should be relative) - http://pastebin.com/xny57n1Y
[09:05:25] <shoky`> caraconan: there's no such thing as a </img>  ;p
[09:05:57] <arc_> tru
[09:05:57] <caraconan> shoky: ok, thanks, anyway I'm still having issues with .enhancewithin invoking the vclick event
[09:06:47] <codecutter> any ideas?
[09:06:55] <arc_> does the word enhance have some meaning i'm not familiar with in this case
[09:07:41] <caraconan> arc_: it applies the jquery mobile styles at runtime
[09:09:54] <shoky`> codecutter: position:relative does not apply to table rows
[09:13:44] <codecutter> have a look at the existing firebug output for the row http://pastebin.com/8fCVu6Qc
[09:15:18] <codecutter> thats all the css currently applied to the row as shown via 'inspect element' gives back
[09:16:29] <derstrom> codecutter: http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/visuren.html#propdef-position "The effect of 'position:relative' on [table-row] elements is undefined."
[09:17:22] <derstrom> position:static is the default property value, which makes sense after you try and set it to position:relative
[09:20:00] <codecutter> i see.
[09:21:41] <codecutter> derstrom: if a modify the dom via firebug and replace the css with 'relative'  directly i seem to get the effect that I want. How do get around this?
[09:23:02] <arc_> well, you can create a class and apply the class to that element instead of trying to directly modify its css
[09:23:12] <arc_> which is how it's normally done anyway
[09:23:47] <arc_> but there's no guarantee this non-standard behavior will work across all browsers
[09:24:39] <codecutter> hmm
[09:28:07] <derstrom> codecutter: Why do you need the tr element to be relative? Bear in mind, you can use div's inside td elements, which you can then set to position:relative. Although I am doing guess work here as I don't know what you are trying to accomplish.
[09:29:38] <codecutter> i see the problem
[09:29:39] <codecutter> nvm
[09:29:51] <codecutter> i should add a class to the table element
[09:30:22] <derstrom> Remember nothing inside a table can be position:relative, at least with any sort of guaranteed browser support.
[09:30:42] <derstrom> See: http://stackoverflow.com/a/6079254
[09:31:27] <codecutter> ok
[09:31:29] <codecutter> thx
[09:55:38] <robhol> roundToNearest(0.35, 0.05, Math.floor) == 0.30000000000000004   sigh.. :(
[09:56:10] <robhol> is there an implementation of this that is a bit more resilient to inaccuracies?
[09:56:32] <robhol> My naive implementation was return roundStrategy(n/m) * m;
[09:56:52] <codecutter> this print false but next line fails to add the class to the table element http://pastebin.com/mZ6tVqxS
[10:11:47] <song> hi, does anyone use http://esimakin.github.io/twbs-pagination/ ? It seems pretty easy. but I can not get my first page loaded at page load time. This is very weird.

[10:37:40] <codecutter> I'm adding a class to an element via addClass, it shows up on the log but not visible on element inspect. Any suggestions?
[10:39:42] <codecutter> e.g. console log shows that class that was added but if i inspect element directly its not there.
[10:39:42] <codecutter> $compTable.addClass('show');
[10:39:42] <codecutter> console.log($compTable);
[10:41:38] <codecutter> what is the meaning of this?
[10:41:44] <codecutter> hmm
[10:44:41] <codecutter> just before that i do replace some of the html via replaceWith perhaps this is the cause?
[10:45:11] <codecutter> but then it should not able to find the selector
[10:45:34] <codecutter> ($comptable)
[10:57:17] <shoky`> codecutter: addClass should work fine.. maybe something in your code is removing it afterwards ?  make a jsfiddle showing the problem if you need more help

[14:40:09] <Jagst3r15> do I need .each() or somethin
[15:01:14] <Jagst3r15> anyone have any idea?
[15:01:36] <ThePendulum> let me see
[15:02:05] <ThePendulum> have you tried .each()?
[15:09:09] <joepie91> Jagst3r15: .map
[15:09:31] <joepie91> Jagst3r15: http://cryto.net/~joepie91/blog/2015/05/04/functional-programming-in-javascript-map-filter-reduce/
[15:09:48] <Jagst3r15> thanks
[15:10:05] <joepie91> Jagst3r15: both the native Array object and jQuery provide a .map, though in the case of jQuery you'll have to finish with a .get() to get the actual plain values, without being wrapped in a jQuery object

[15:49:15] <ThePendulum> lively channel today
[16:28:26] <Joelesign> Hi guys!
[16:29:36] <Joelesign> Please, what's wrong with this line of code? !$(".users label").hasClass(".admin").hide();
[16:29:51] <Joelesign> I have an error! "Uncaught TypeError: $(...).hasClass(...).hide is not a function"
[16:30:28] * Joelesign is sorry to paste source code here
[16:31:46] <rcyr> Joelesign: What do you think .hasClass returns?
[16:32:08] <ThePendulum> >> true.hide();
[16:32:11] <ThePendulum> that's not going to work
[16:32:57] <Joelesign> I want to hide all label who doesn't have .admin class
[16:33:21] <rcyr> You're not answering.
[16:33:26] <rcyr> Joelesign: What do you think .hasClass returns?
[16:34:55] <Joelesign> true if the giveen class miss
[16:35:11] <rcyr> Joelesign: Does the value "true" has a .hide method?
[16:35:22] <Joelesign> And then, hide all related elements
[16:35:24] <Joelesign> rcyr: Sorry, what do you mean?
[16:35:45] <rcyr> Joelesign: if .hasClass returns either "true" or "false", why do you call .hide on it?
[16:36:07] <rcyr> Joelesign: The ThePendulum said, it's like trying to do   true.hide() or false.hide()
[16:36:21] <ThePendulum> If you chain functions like that, you call each function on the result of the previous
[16:36:22] <rcyr> Joelesign: What you want is to use a "if" statement.
[16:36:30] <Joelesign> Hmm I see
[16:37:14] <Joelesign> Yes your'e right
[16:37:23] <Joelesign> I see now
[16:37:31] <ThePendulum> Why don't you select elements with both the .users and .admin class in the first place?
[16:37:35] <rcyr> Joelesign: The easy fix: $('.users label:not(.admin)').hide()
[16:37:41] <Joelesign> rcyr! Okey, gonna try right now
[16:37:58] <ThePendulum> or that, sorry, overlooked what you were trying to do
[16:43:01] <Joelesign> rcyr: Yep! It's working. :)
[16:43:06] <rcyr> Woohoo!
[16:43:08] <Joelesign> rcyr: Thanks man
[16:43:27] <Joelesign> I got something out of it
[16:43:30] <rcyr> You're welcome :P Just remember to not call jQuery functions on booleans :P
[16:44:50] <Joelesign> rcyr: Sure! ;)
[16:46:19] <Joelesign> rcyr: I'm a UI designer basicaly, so jQuery is not really my thing ^^
[16:46:29] <rcyr> All good :)
[16:50:33] <Joelesign> rcyr: I am seeing that the hide() function doesn't remove the target element from the DOM
[16:50:46] <rcyr> No, it doesn't, do you want that?
[16:50:53] <rcyr> If so, .remove()
[16:51:17] <Joelesign> rcyr: Thanks
[16:51:28] <Joelesign> And to show them back?
[16:51:51] <Joelesign> If needed
[16:53:17] <rcyr> Then use hide and show instead.
[16:53:47] <rcyr> Else you're just making your code more complicated.
[16:55:53] <Joelesign> rcyr: Ok. I was wondering if the hidden forms will not be submited...
[16:56:38] <jak2000> http://jsfiddle.net/jamiguel77/d2svykhk/1/    <-- why not sum when blur on the firt input? thaks
[16:56:38] <rcyr> Ah!
[16:56:42] <rcyr> They're form elements
[16:56:55] <rcyr> Joelesign: Then yeah, you need to either remove them or disable them
[16:57:02] <rcyr> Joelesign: In your case, disabling might be easier.
[16:58:09] <rcyr> Joelesign: You can change that by doing: .prop('disabled', true);
[16:58:20] <Joelesign> rcyr: Another soft an cool line of code to do it please?
[16:58:21] <rcyr> Joelesign: true or false depending if you want to disable/enable it.
[16:58:43] <rcyr> Joelesign: So, before you hide it, disable it.
[16:58:45] <Joelesign> rcyr: Thanks, let me try this
[16:58:51] <rcyr> And do the opposite when you need to show.
[16:59:59] <Joelesign> Ok
[17:02:20] <jak2000> rcyr  any advice?
[17:02:23] <jak2000> plz
[17:06:20] <Joelesign> rcyr: It seems to work; but when I check with firebug, the disabled tags(radio) don't have a disabled="" attribute
[17:06:25] <Joelesign> Is it ok?
[17:06:28] <rcyr> Yes
[17:06:37] <Joelesign> Cool!

[17:32:26] <Joelesign> rcyr: I create a jsFiddle to show you the stuff I made: http://jsfiddle.net/goLwpnxz/
[17:32:48] <Joelesign> rcyr: If you can take a loot of it please :)
[17:32:55] <Joelesign> *look
[17:36:31] <Joelesign> rcyr: Is it well done?
[17:45:46] <shoky> dn5: http://jsfiddle.net/80x81cdr/1/
[17:46:38] <shoky> dn5: and to fix it in your fiddle you'd need in line 5 to change  $("a.groupcat").attr(...)   to  $(this).attr(...)
[17:47:30] <shoky> jak2000: check your console
[17:52:51] <Joelesign> shoky: Is there a better way to writte the jQuery code here please? http://jsfiddle.net/goLwpnxz/
[17:53:35] <Joelesign> shoky: I just want to make sure it's well done
[17:57:27] <shoky> Joelesign: sec
[18:03:00] <Joelesign> shoky: ok
[18:08:44] <shoky> Joelesign: i'd maybe write it more like this  http://jsfiddle.net/goLwpnxz/1/
[18:09:37] <shoky> also added an "all" checkbox, seemed missing
[18:10:45] <Papuc> hi, i need some help, i want to understand http://jqueryboilerplate.com/ , it says it's for biginners, but i'm having troubles understanding documentation, what tutorials should i fallow?
[18:10:45] <Joelesign> shoky: Thanks, I'm looking at it
[18:11:43] <shoky> er i meant an "all" radio
[18:11:45] <Joelesign> shoky: How about replacing the "check all" with a button?
[18:12:05] <Joelesign> So that the button text will change to "Uncheck all" and vis-versa
[18:12:17] <shoky> Joelesign: usually you'd have it as a checkbox, but you also need to uncheck it when any of the user checkboxes is unchecked
[18:12:59] <shoky> Joelesign: oh so you want it to still function like a checkbox. that's no problem
[18:13:05] <Joelesign> shoky: Yeah sure!
[18:13:14] <shoky> go for it ;p
[18:17:24] <Joelesign> shoky: Seems like "checl all" select all radios even those who are not currently showed?
[18:17:44] <Joelesign> If so, they will all be submited right?
[18:18:00] <Joelesign> And I don't want that to happen. :)
[18:19:08] <shoky> Joelesign: then don't check them :P
[18:19:37] <shoky> the ones that are disabled shouldn't get submitted tho
[18:19:49] <shoky> but yea if you go back to "all" or smth they're checked and enabled
[18:20:06] <shoky> in your fiddle you didn't re-enable them btw ;p
[18:20:56] <shoky> Joelesign: oh you didnt disable them either, and neither did i.  we're disabling the lables instead of the inputs ;p
[18:21:19] <Joelesign> shoky: Wow!
[18:21:38] <Joelesign> Big error hey? >_<
[18:22:19] <shoky> yerp
[18:24:15] <Joelesign> shoky: Help me fix it please?
[18:24:35] <shoky> Joelesign: can't help if i don't see you trying anything ;)
[18:25:42] <Joelesign> Hmm
[18:25:47] <Joelesign> Okay!
[18:45:03] <Joelesign> shoky: I have try to add userCheckboxes.attr('disabled',true); just after the .hide(), but didn't work :(
[18:46:29] <Joelesign> shoky: Can't see a way to it, I'm still new to the jQuery World ^^
[18:48:43] <shoky> Joelesign: it's .prop  not .attr. and why are you disabling all of them?
[18:49:08] <Joelesign> Not all of them
[18:49:21] <shoky> userCheckboxes is all of them
[18:49:36] <Joelesign> Ohh! >_<
[18:51:28] <shoky> you can get the checkboxes with for example- userLabels.find('input')
[18:51:33] <Joelesign> So how will I disable just the unshowed ones here?
[18:51:59] <shoky> get the checkboxes from the labels which you already have
[18:53:59] <orion> Hi. I need to install an event handler on a form. Where on the page is the proper place to do this?
[18:54:37] <Joelesign> shoky: Like this? userLabels.find('input').prop('disabled',true);
[18:55:44] <shoky> Joelesign: that would disable all of them
[18:56:41] <shoky> (because userLabels is all the labels)
[18:57:22] <Joelesign> And how in this case will I disable just thos withing the disable labels?
[18:57:45] <Joelesign> Can't how to deal here
[18:58:00] <Joelesign> *Can't see
[18:58:02] <shoky> by calling it only on those labels
[18:58:23] <Joelesign> How?
[18:58:27] <shoky> in my fiddle it already finds those labels
[18:58:37] <shoky> if you don't understand everything in my fiddle
[18:58:55] <shoky> then stop, and first learn the stuff in the fiddle
[18:59:07] <Joelesign> userLabels.not(usersToShow).find('input').prop('disabled',true);
[18:59:23] <shoky> yes.. do you understand what that does?
[18:59:23] <Joelesign> Like this?
[18:59:33] <Joelesign> Yes I do
[18:59:38] <Joelesign> :)
[18:59:52] <shoky> k :)
[19:00:08] <Joelesign> It do make sense in my mind now :)
[19:00:30] <shoky> awesomes
[19:01:47] <Joelesign> shoky: So is that all? http://jsfiddle.net/goLwpnxz/4/
[19:03:58] <shoky> Joelesign: that still calls .prop('disabled'..  on labels in lines 16-17,  and it doesn't re-enable any checkboxes
[19:04:11] <Joelesign> shoky: It still disable all the checkboxes
[19:05:18] <shoky> Joelesign: no it doesn't
[19:05:28] <shoky> it just disables some, but it doesn't re-enable any
[19:07:36] <Joelesign> shoky: Got a fix?
[19:08:06] <shoky> Joelesign: to re-enable checkboxes,  call .prop('disabled', false)  on them  :)
[19:08:08] <Joelesign> I'm roast >_<
[19:08:11] <shoky> as you know
[19:08:30] <shoky> did you see where i said:  <shoky> Joelesign: that still calls .prop('disabled'..  on labels in lines 16-17,  and it doesn't re-enable any checkboxes
[19:08:53] <shoky> still doing that Big Error
[19:09:15] <Joelesign> Hmm
[19:12:41] <Joelesign> shoky: Gotta rest, I'm burn-out
[19:12:52] <Joelesign> Will go back to it toùorrow
[19:13:23] <Joelesign> Thanks a lot for helping! :)
[19:13:46] <Joelesign> I learn interresting stuffs ;)
[19:14:24] <shoky> np. i'm off too, seeya
[19:14:43] <Joelesign> See you man!
[20:15:23] <kegster> is there a way to create a parallax effect (on a div) but not have the background image be stretched? sort of wanting to position a drawing of a dragon that shows more as you scroll, but every parallax method i've tried seems to stretch the background
[20:24:29] <albedoa> https://gist.github.com/albedoa/0158eed25b2ee7181855 i have this in a .js file in Wordpress, which uses a "no conflict" instance of jQuery. i want to turn it into a function addLine() so i can call it using that name. how do i go about doing that?
[21:32:27] <firestarter> hey guys, for propertynames of objects, should you use camcelcase or underscores?
[22:45:24] <Rafa333> hi
[22:46:01] <Rafa333> i'm a bit confused now about Jquery.serialize()
[22:48:59] <Rafa333> i have a form that i'm loading via Ajax $(document).ready(function() {}) ther i invoke all the ajax and later i set the values with jquery and then i send another ajax query to get my final data .... my specific problem i that form.serialize omits some controls that i have changed values recently ...
[22:49:45] <Rafa333> reading more about it ... i think there are on some temporal"unseccesul" state i don't know how can i ovid this situation
[22:51:11] <Rafa333> this problem only ocurs the first time i want to use form.serialize() in  $(document).ready(function() {}) .... when i interact with the elements on the page after loaded .... everythings sends ok
[22:51:12] <Rafa333> any suggestions ?
[22:54:27] <Rafa333> ????
[23:02:09] <Max-P> Rafa333: Do you have a minimal example? When debugging complex problems, cutting down any unnecessary code really helps identifying the problem
[23:03:43] <Rafa333> minimal example ... i don't think so .... but let me try
[23:09:08] <arc_> i'm not a fan of this trend for sites to use fancy autocompletion when it doesn't serve any purpose
[23:09:25] <arc_> like for example, a search box where you type the name of a tv show or movie
[23:09:47] <arc_> no i'm not looking for anything with the word modern in it
[23:09:58] <arc_> just let my browser autocomplete do its thing
