[00:09:17] <benjings> anyone got a sec to help me out with a jquery issue I'm having?
[00:10:01] <pixelpimp> the psychics come in on tuesday
[00:10:20] <benjings> :P
[00:16:33] <benjings> well, if anyone is interested, I'm just wondering if there is a better method for hiding a html select input
[00:16:34] <benjings> http://jsfiddle.net/zfmGd/
[00:16:51] <benjings> I'm substituting it with jquery so I have a decent/accessible fallback
[00:18:30] <serapath> hello
[00:18:49] <serapath> i use this function within my html file to add functionality to a button:
[00:18:52] <serapath>  onclick='addRow({name: $("#pName").val(), format: $("#pFormat").val()})'
[00:19:12] <serapath> it can use $('#responsive > .modal-footer > .btn-primary') to select the button
[00:19:38] <serapath> how would i add the 'addRow' function in a way that gets all the form fields for me?
[00:22:37] <pixelpimp> .css('display', 'none')
[00:22:37] <pixelpimp> i guess source.css('display', 'none') inside your createDropDown()
[00:23:43] <Cork> pixelpimp: why display: none; just use hide()
[00:25:53] <pixelpimp> well hide() does a few more things than just hide it via CSS
[00:25:57] <pixelpimp> but that would work, yes.
[00:30:57] <williamsasa> When set  $(this) in a function , it isn't work when I call function by onclick() ,anybody knows the reason?
[00:32:03] <williamsasa> change the funtion to click event, not the onclick will solve the problem, but I do't know the reason ~
[00:32:28] <stemid> anyone here familiar with blockUI plugin and can help me get rid of that line? http://jsfiddle.net/8kjz2/2/
[00:32:31] <stemid> the message box
[00:39:20] <Cork> williamsasa: could you show the code in question?
[00:39:24] <Cork> (jsfiddle.net)
[00:40:57] <Cork> stemid: http://jsfiddle.net/8kjz2/4/
[00:41:11] <Cork> the browsers inspector is your friend!
[00:42:57] <crippa> hello. I'm looking for a way to upload big files (3-6GB) via browser. The best would be having the possibility to resume the upload if teh connection breaks. Does anyone know a tool for doing this?
[00:43:28] <Cork> crippa: the limitation is normally server side not client side
[00:43:40] <crippa> what do you mean?
[00:43:40] <stemid> jesus christ Cork
[00:43:41] <stemid> thanks
[00:44:36] <Cork> crippa: ex. if you have php on the server side taking the upload, you will have to have 3gb * 1.34 amount of ram for each upload that should run at the same time
[00:45:10] <Cork> as php will cache the file in ram before it runs base64 decode on it and saves it to the disk
[00:45:33] <crippa> that's not an issue, th eproblem is finding a tool that allows me to do that
[00:45:36] <Cork> so normally the best option is to have the client split the file up into chunks and send those instead
[00:45:47] <crippa> great
[00:46:04] <Cork> there are plenty of libs that does that for you
[00:46:15] <Cork> just search for ajax uploads
[00:46:23] <crippa> What I'm doing now is using an applet that splits the file and sends it. I'm looking for another solution
[00:46:23] <Cork> (possibly with jquery in there too)
[00:46:24] <uwjesq> Hello. How can I execute a function when the inner html of element x changes?
[00:46:28] <serapath> could someone tell me what i'm doing wrong?
[00:46:30] <serapath> http://pastebin.com/Muhzb3xY
[00:46:34] <crippa> ah ok
[00:46:44] <crippa> I'll look into that. thanks
[00:46:57] <serapath> i used to use line 2 in my html and it worked just fine
[00:47:00] <Cork> uwjesq: you can't do it cross browser
[00:47:11] <serapath> now i'm instead adding an event listener but cant get the values of my form fields
[00:47:18] <Cork> uwjesq: you would have to have the code updating the inner html trigger your function
[00:47:46] <uwjesq> Cork: :-(
[00:48:34] <serapath> would be awesome if someone could give me a hint what i'm doing wrong within my event listener
[00:48:36] <Cork> uwjesq: there is a standard for mutation observers, but it is too new to be used without a fallback yet
[00:49:03] <Cork> serapath: not sure what the question is
[00:49:20] <serapath> it doesnt work
[00:49:31] <Cork> what doesn't work?
[00:49:48] <serapath> Cork: i used to use line 2 in my html file to add an attribute to my button onclick="...see line 2..."
[00:50:08] <serapath> now i'm adding the listener in my javascript file the way u can see in that pastebin
[00:50:14] <serapath> but it doesnt retrieve any values from the form
[00:50:28] <serapath> in line 2 i retrieve the values the same way and it works
[00:50:45] <serapath> ...when i used line 2 as an attribute on my button within the html file itself
[00:50:46] <Cork> serapath: name: $("#pName").val() !== name: $('.modal-body #pName')
[00:51:07] <Cork> also the class selector isn't needed there
[00:51:16] <serapath> the .modal-body actually is a ancestor of #pName
[00:51:18] <Cork> you can remove the .modal-body
[00:51:20] <serapath> but either way it doesnt work
[00:51:24] <Cork> doesn't matter
[00:51:28] <Cork> the id has to be uniq anyway
[00:51:35] <serapath> it is
[00:51:45] <Cork> then it is just unneeded work for the browser
[00:51:57] <Cork> anyway my point was the original code used .val() for name
[00:52:00] <Cork> the new one doesn't
[00:52:11] <Cork> same for format
[00:52:56] <Cork> serapath: http://pastebin.com/ShJYqRvN
[00:53:28] <Cork> also line 3 doesn't do anything
[00:54:45] <crippa> Cork: do you think this will do?
[00:54:47] <crippa> http://malsup.com/jquery/form/#code-samples
[00:54:57] <serapath> yes line 3 isnt needed, but even with ur version (what i did before), it gives me 'undefined' 4 times
[00:55:19] <Cork> crippa: for file upload? no it won't
[00:55:51] <Cork> as far as i know it doesn't handle files
[00:56:05] <Cork> hmm
[00:56:06] <crippa> http://plugins.jquery.com/blueimp-file-upload-jquery-ui/
[00:56:21] <Cork> crippa: it was added since i last checked it
[00:56:57] <crippa> this: http://plugins.jquery.com/blueimp-file-upload-jquery-ui/ looks promising to me
[00:57:06] <serapath> still doesnt work. how else would i retrieve values from a form with jquery?
[00:57:37] <Cork> serapath: serialize() or serializeArray() would be the simplest way
[01:11:02] <uwjesq> Cork: What do I do? Callback to an empty function which I overwrite if I want to hook behaviour into the ajax call?
[01:11:46] <Cork> uwjesq: ya, that is one way to solve it
[01:11:54] <Cork> $.noop() could be the default function
[01:13:03] <uwjesq> Cork: ic. Thank you.
[01:39:17] <daveAway> hi, i got a problem with my div with an image not loading in time
[01:39:28] <daveAway> http://pastebin.com/0zRzch38  that's the paste
[01:39:43] <daveAway> i can paste the whole function if needed
[01:40:16] <Cork> daveAway: you would have to wait for the load event to trigger on the img tag
[01:40:47] <daveAway> i tried using mydiv.find('img').load(){} on a seperate line
[01:40:53] <daveAway> im not sure how i'd do that
[01:41:00] <daveAway> ill google
[01:42:19] <Cork> var domData = $(data); data.find('img').on('load', function() {}; domData.insertAfter().css...
[01:42:22] <Cork> daveAway: ^
[01:42:34] <Cork> opps missed a ) in there
[01:43:56] <daveAway> ah using on load instead
[01:44:18] <daveAway> i was using 'load'
[01:44:29] <daveAway> in the previous version
[01:44:32] <Cork> it's the same thing
[01:44:41] <daveAway> oh
[01:44:52] <Cork> var domData = $(data); data.find('img').load(function() {}); domData.insertAfter().css... would work just as well
[01:44:54] <daveAway> i figured it works like click
[01:45:01] <Cork> but the order your adding things is important
[01:45:25] <daveAway> ah yes, i think i get it
[01:45:26] <Cork> you MUSHT bind the event on a parsed html string
[01:45:36] <Cork> and it has be be before you add it to the dom
[01:45:42] <daveAway> cos its waiting for it
[01:45:53] <daveAway> as opposed to doing it, then waiting for it?
[01:46:42] <Cork> ya
[01:46:53] <Cork> cause if you do the later you most likely will miss the event
[02:09:04] <daveAway> gah, can i show you where it's at atm?
[02:09:31] <daveAway> http://pastebin.com/0zRzch38
[02:09:42] <daveAway> that's the code with the order amendment
[02:10:01] <daveAway> in my other one when it's not using the ajax obj array, it works fine as it was before
[02:10:09] <daveAway> this is all done within the callback(?) of the ajax call
[02:11:07] <daveAway> now when it's called, it gets into animate part, but it just removes all divs and it's still not waiting
[02:11:45] <daveAway> its a film strip image slider btw
[02:21:19] <doug65536> daveAway: there are many slider libraries. are you doing this for an exercise for yourself? If you just want it done I'm sure there is a library already written that will do this for you
[02:25:16] <daveAway> for myself
[02:25:42] <daveAway> and will be using it, if i can build it myself, it means i can customise it myself
[02:27:19] <daveAway> it works you see, when i dont use an array of objects from ajax
[02:27:39] <daveAway> but now using the ajax call it's all gone tits up, im assuming all down to (as cork highlighted) timing of stuff
[02:27:42] <daveAway> and order of things
[02:28:13] <doug65536> daveAway: can you show the ajax code? I just got here a moment ago
[02:28:27] <xqo> hi
[02:28:47] <xqo> can you store variables beyond the scope and runtime of a function somehow?
[02:29:02] <doug65536> xqo: yes
[02:29:19] <Cork> xqo: yes, as long as you have a variable from outside the scope you can use that
[02:29:32] <Cork> xqo: and if that one is an object, you can just attach them to it
[02:29:55] <Cork> var options = {}; (function() { options.something = true; })()
[02:29:59] <daveAway> http://pastebin.com/0zRzch38
[02:30:00] <daveAway> at the bottom
[02:30:31] <daveAway> the main picture slider works, it gets the right url for the image
[02:30:35] <doug65536> daveAway: you omitted the part I really wanted to see. you don't do anything after the ajax call ?
[02:30:46] <daveAway> lol, you mean you want the whole code?
[02:31:13] <doug65536> daveAway: not really. just trying to help
[02:31:15] <daveAway> i'd need to format the whole thing, it pastes funny when i put it in pastebin
[02:31:22] <xqo> do you need to use var only when creating a variable, or do you need to use it when changing values too?
[02:31:32] <doug65536> xqo: only when creating
[02:31:39] <xqo> okej thank you
[02:31:39] <daveAway> if you guys know how to change the tab distance in notepad++ that'd sort it out
[02:33:07] <daveAway> http://pastebin.com/0zRzch38
[02:33:15] <okdamn> hi guys is here any bug with blur() and chrome?
[02:33:27] <okdamn> cause in Firefox blur works but not in chrome for me :(
[02:33:58] <okdamn> i'm just doing http://pastebin.com/xD9jdaPd
[02:34:10] <okdamn> but Chrome doesn't seems to affect the blur :/
[02:34:22] <daveAway> that's the film strip load and shift right doug65536
[02:35:19] <okdamn> do you even know if it's a problem using blur on chrome?
[02:35:21] <okdamn> blur()
[02:35:31] <doug65536> daveAway: you realize that the $.ajax call will return and run through the following code long before the ajax call finishes, right?
[02:36:29] <doug65536> daveAway: $.ajax is asynchronous
[02:36:59] <doug65536> daveAway: you probably intended for all that code after the ajax call to be inside the ajax completion callback
[02:38:17] <doug65536> you can tell $.ajax to not return early with async: false
[02:38:20] <okdamn> why won't this work on Chrome http://jsfiddle.net/q84wv/ ??
[02:38:25] <okdamn> in Firefox it works perfectly
[02:38:28] <xqo> do you need to do anything special inside functions when changing global variables?
[02:38:49] <xqo> declare global or anything?
[02:38:58] <doug65536> xqo: if it is really global, use window.
[02:39:10] <daveAway> yeah it is all in the callback,
[02:39:15] <daveAway> yeah i think i pasted the rest one sec
[02:39:18] <daveAway> ill paste direct
[02:39:35] <doug65536> xqo: and ideally, make a name for yourself and put it in window.xqostuff.my_global
[02:39:41] <xqo> okej thank you
[02:39:53] <doug65536> xqo: at the beginning do window.xqostuff = {}
[02:39:58] <asdfz0mg> okdamn it works for me in chrome 28
[02:40:02] <Cork> okdamn: http://jsfiddle.net/q84wv/1/ works just fine here
[02:40:05] <xqo> doug65536 http://snook.ca/archives/javascript/global_variable
[02:40:16] <Cork> the alert is problematic to use in those kind of events though
[02:40:19] <xqo> that link says making globals attaches variables to windows
[02:40:25] <xqo> automatically
[02:40:45] <doug65536> xqo: well, it does to a certain extent
[02:40:56] <doug65536> xqo: try checking if XYZ === undefined
[02:41:07] <xqo> cba, but tldr i should attach to windows?
[02:41:14] <Cork> okdamn: also you need to use tab, as chrome doesn't put focus on links by default
[02:41:25] <doug65536> xqo: you *rarely* actually need globals
[02:41:28] <Cork> (unless you use the keyboard to focus it)
[02:41:34] <okdamn> Cork:  unbelievable it doesn't works on my chrome
[02:41:38] <okdamn> i have latest version on macosx
[02:41:45] <okdamn> need to trigger focus on click?
[02:41:48] <Cork> ah mac
[02:41:49] <okdamn> with jquery
[02:41:56] <Cork> mac has a different way of handling focus
[02:42:02] <doug65536> xqo: use an immediately invoked function expression to limit scope
[02:42:04] <xqo> doug65536 i want to check whether or not the user is sorting by desc or asc and wanted to store the last value, so that if you sort again it changes from desc to asc or the other way around. not a good way to do it?
[02:42:15] <asdfz0mg> it works for me in chrome on mac
[02:42:25] <doug65536> xqo: you definitely don't need global for that
[02:42:30] <asdfz0mg> i'm tabbing throught the links and the event fires
[02:42:32] <xqo> doug65536 how would you do it?
[02:42:58] <doug65536> I'll show you a nice way to preserve stuff across callbacks...
[02:43:08] <xqo> yesplz!
[02:43:35] <okdamn> Cork:  ok but browser should be the same
[02:43:40] <okdamn> i mean bha so strange
[02:43:41] <Cork> okdamn: no
[02:43:49] <Cork> focus works based on how focus works in the system
[02:43:59] <Cork> not in a generic web way
[02:44:11] <okdamn> uhmm i think it's based on how focus works in the browser but probably you're right
[02:44:14] <okdamn> and i'm wrong
[02:44:45] <Cork> okdamn: yes, but what i mean is the spec leaves that to be "how it works in the system"
[02:44:55] <Cork> okdamn: and then the browser can choose to not do it that way
[02:45:22] <Cork> okdamn: but if you look cross browsers, you can't depend on how focus works for none form elements
[02:45:46] <Cork> (and not fully for how it works for form elements either)
[02:46:13] <okdamn> Cork:  understood but 90% web users don't uses tab key, i need a work around
[02:46:18] <okdamn> like to trigger focus !?
[02:47:05] <Cork> okdamn: you could try $().mousedown(function() { $(this).focus(); });
[02:47:16] <doug65536> xqo: http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/9jRbR/35/
[02:47:38] <okdamn> the logic is click a , then click another so alert()
[02:47:42] <okdamn> so i need a focusout
[02:47:44] <okdamn> or blur
[02:47:54] <okdamn> problem is it seems focusout not working too :/
[02:48:02] <Cork> when you focus the new element, the old one will blur
[02:48:06] <Cork> so focus is what you want
[02:48:35] <xqo> doug65536 so if i want to do it that way i need to change from passing button to the function from html, to using your method with checking all buttons?
[02:49:03] <xqo> "$.each($('button'), function() {" instead of onclick, i mean?
[02:49:42] <okdamn> Cork:  http://jsfiddle.net/q84wv/5/
[02:49:48] <okdamn> for me it doesn't works on Chrome :(
[02:50:20] <grafi> dafuq
[02:50:29] <Cork> okdamn: http://jsfiddle.net/q84wv/7/
[02:53:04] <okdamn> Cork:  thanks a lot
[02:53:06] <okdamn> i fixed
[02:53:10] <okdamn> using blur and mouseup
[02:53:14] <okdamn> for chrome mouseup it's ok
[02:53:51] <Cork> okdamn: uh
[02:54:04] <ph88> i have console.log(ajax);  where ajax is a jQuery jqXHR   when i inspect that object i see it has a responseText  ... but when i do console.log(ajax.responseText);   i see "undefined"  ... why can't i get the responseText from that object ??
[02:54:07] <Cork> blur on mouseup will trigger the wrong thing
[02:54:26] <Cork> as it will trigger blur on the current element, not the original one
[02:54:55] <doug65536> xqo: the "each" makes each button's click handler have its own scope, yes
[02:55:12] <xqo> doug65536 okej, thank you!
[02:55:34] <okdamn> Cork:  nothing to trigger using mouseup
[02:55:38] <okdamn> it works ;)
[02:55:48] <okdamn> on('blur mouseup',function(){})
[02:55:58] <okdamn> and away i go , thanks that you helped me a lot
[02:56:21] <Cork> okdamn: sounds like you don't need blur at all...
[02:56:43] <okdamn> Cork:  uhm probably i can't cut it off right
[02:57:11] <okdamn> i can *
[02:57:35] <xqo> doug65536 http://hastebin.com/yuliyifeni.coffee
[02:58:22] <doug65536> xqo: you lave jquery loading?
[02:58:25] <doug65536> have*
[02:58:27] <xqo> yes
[02:59:37] <doug65536> xqo: that code is correct
[03:00:11] <ph88> found the answer .. need to use done() because it's async
[03:00:22] <xqo> doug65536 okej. im sticking with onclicks then. maybe this framework is doing something, idk.
[03:00:31] <doug65536> xqo: http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/s5NeP/
[03:00:45] <doug65536> use jquery. instead of $.
[03:00:56] <doug65536> jQuery
[03:01:15] <xqo> jQuery(function() { .--- }); ?
[03:01:30] <doug65536> http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/s5NeP/1/
[03:01:48] <doug65536> missed the $("button one
[03:01:51] <doug65536> you get the idea
[03:02:11] <doug65536> http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/s5NeP/2/
[03:02:19] <daveAway> i dont get it, when i log it all i see it doing everything as it should
[03:02:24] <doug65536> xqo: $ is short for jQuery
[03:02:38] <xqo> doug65536 same error
[03:02:59] <doug65536> xqo: is it up on a website I can look at? PM me if you like
[03:07:20] <eventhorizon> Hello all
[03:08:12] <eventhorizon> What is the best way to expand a numeric range?
[03:08:19] <eventhorizon> Example
[03:08:53] <ph88> my .done() function is not being called ... how do i set the done method probably without writing it twice ??  http://pastebin.com/7biMq6Dc
[03:09:04] <eventhorizon> I would like to expand the something[0-9].somethingelse[9-100]
[03:09:16] <eventhorizon> Which will be entered via form field
[03:19:31] <ph88> attempt #2 is also not working :(   http://pastebin.com/9vE5Mg1g
[03:21:07] <Cork> ph88: why don't you just save the options string in the if case and run the model.save just once?
[03:21:35] <Cork> should make the code a bit cleaner to read too
[03:21:45] <ph88> ah the options object, yes great idea !
[03:21:49] <ph88> let me just try that
[03:22:27] <Cork> though i don't see why this code should give you any problem
[03:22:55] <xqo> should i use switch-statements when there is only 1 case, or do i use if?
[03:22:55] <Cork> except possibly the user of .html(jqXHR.responseText)
[03:23:06] <Cork> xqo: if
[03:24:22] <ph88> hhmm this one with done() doesn't work ... http://pastebin.com/2at9hpgr   ... i witll try the other method now
[03:25:10] <Cork> ph88: and you're sure .save() actually returns a jqXHR object?
[03:25:51] <ph88> pretty sure ... the manual says so http://backbonejs.org/#Model-save  and when doing console.log() on it ... it looked like an jqXHR
[03:26:31] <xqo> does this line need a semi-colon? h2_2 = +h2_2.match(/^(\d+)/)[0]
[03:26:55] <Cork> ph88: Returns a jqXHR if validation is successful and false otherwise.
[03:27:50] <ph88> well i don't have any validation on my model
[03:28:04] <eager> hi, I'm trying to explain jquery to someone, but as it turns out, I'm not an expert in javascript either. Now here is where I'm stuck in the explanation:
[03:28:17] <ph88> if i do   var ajax = this.model.save()  .... and then do console.log(ajax);  how can i tell for sure if it's a jqXHR object ?
[03:28:29] <Cork> ph88: try binding an always event listener and see if it is triggered
[03:28:45] <ph88> by the way ... this is another attempt which didn't work either http://pastebin.com/uTn907rs
[03:29:16] <eager> jQuery creates an object in the browser's ...  what? jQuery is an object within the Window object? How should one make it sound to make sense?
[03:29:21] <Cork> ph88: why are you using responseText instead of data?
[03:29:53] <Cork> eager: jquery is a tool that you use to do dom manipulations
[03:30:08] <ph88> Cork: before i was using callbacks i only had the responseText to work with ... i will change that thoug ... but the console.log() statements before that don't print anything
[03:30:16] <eager> Should I say: browsers provide a window object to any document being viewed?
[03:30:16] <Cork> eager: the set of tools is collected under window.jQuery and aliased in window.$
[03:30:33] <Cork> eager: are you explaining javascript or jquery?
[03:30:42] <eager> yeah, well, :)
[03:31:04] <eager> yes, I wanted to have a clarifying word about the wrapper situation
[03:31:11] <Cork> ph88: so the event IS triggered?
[03:31:23] <Cork> ph88: the problem is the data you get?
[03:31:36] <ph88> no it's not triggered
[03:31:49] <Cork> ph88: then try binding always
[03:31:56] <Cork> might be the event is failing or something
[03:32:06] <ph88> binding ... with done()  ??
[03:32:26] <Cork> .done().always(function() { alert('ended'); })
[03:32:27] <ph88> i mispelled succes
[03:33:02] <Cork> ph88: well that doesn't explain why .done doens't work
[03:33:17] <ph88> true ... and also i correctly wrote success now and it still doesn't work
[03:33:21] <Cork> eager: window, document, navigator and a few other is created by the browser, it is specified by the core of how js works
[03:33:34] <Cork> ph88: then again try always
[03:34:06] <Cork> eager: this is basic contexts for how you do vanila javascript, and is how js interacts with the browser and the dom
[03:34:37] <Cork> eager: jquery is a framework that helps you do common tasks simpler and more readable
[03:35:01] <eager> yeah, i have ideas for that part, where i'm stuck is telling what the window object is and why/how it is there
[03:35:05] <Cork> eager: it is written in js, so it follows the same rules as js; it just adds some functions for you
[03:35:10] <eager> how does it get there
[03:35:11] <ph88> Cork:  always() works
[03:35:20] <Cork> eager: it's defined by the browser
[03:35:32] <Cork> ph88: then try binding .fail()
[03:35:53] <Cork> uh...
[03:36:22] <Cork> heh, i remembered the correct name :)
[03:36:35] <eager> okay, that shold be fine; window object is something that the browser provides by default for every document -> as an interface for client-side manipulations
[03:37:02] <Cork> uh
[03:37:17] <Cork> do window is the object that holds the page, document is the document in the window
[03:37:32] <Cork> naviator is the object where the browser shows tools to control the browser
[03:37:36] <Cork> like ex the userAgent
[03:38:37] <Cork> eager: window is also superimposed as the page global object
[03:38:47] <eager> wow
[03:38:49] <Cork> so all global variables and functions is attached to this object
[03:39:21] <Cork> and again this is basic parts of javascript
[03:39:28] <ph88> Cork:  this is the code i have now:  http://pastebin.com/7S5MXfBj    This is the console.log()s  http://i.imgur.com/ZiTnfnx.png
[03:39:28] <eager> well, maybe I'll be looking as someone taking the piss, but...
[03:39:42] <eager> where all the objects come from?
[03:39:48] <eager> i know, from the browser
[03:40:13] <Cork> eager: where does alert, if, switch, function ... come from?
[03:40:20] <ph88> Cork:  i understand the problem now .. .it's suppose to pass back the model and not a message
[03:40:24] <ph88> thx for helping
[03:40:33] <eager> but what is the best definition for that concept, the effort of the developers
[03:41:12] <Cork> eager: if you run js in a shell, window only holds the globals nothing else
[03:41:27] <Cork> eager: navigator and document is api points to talk with the browser
[03:41:36] <eager> so I'm still at the point that the window object is created because: it is the root of an environment for manipulating dom on the client side
[03:41:51] <Cork> not sure what you mean by "created"
[03:41:58] <Cork> it is there by default
[03:42:01] <eager> me neither
[03:42:14] <eager> that's the question I'm scratching :)
[03:42:15] <Cork> eager: it is the root of the js script
[03:43:01] <Cork> nothing exist above window (seen from the perspective of content js that is)
[03:44:25] <eager> Cork++
[03:44:33] <eager> thank you very much
[03:46:11] <pedda> hi there
[03:46:23] <pedda> i'm playing around with the twitter bootstrap carousel
[03:46:41] <pedda> i want to extract some custom data attribute on slide event.. depending on wether it's the next or previous element
[03:46:43] <pedda> any hint's how to access the direction?
[03:46:57] <pskli> pedda: I just did and learned this a few minutes ago
[03:47:13] <pskli> $slider.on('slide.bs.carousel', function(data) { ....... });
[03:47:28] <pskli> if you console.log(data) you'll see that you have a lot of information, I think I saw the direction
[03:47:38] <pedda> oh great!
[03:47:40] <pedda> thx
[03:47:44] <pedda> i will test this right away :D
[03:47:44] <pskli> you're welcome!
[03:50:47] <pedda> there is no direction (i couldn't find it at least) but i can use the relatedTarget :)
[03:50:53] <pedda> to accomplish my task
[03:51:08] <pedda> as it contains the class i need to extract and set my body to..
[03:52:20] <pskli> are you sure ;) ? http://img.saika.li/Qpwy
[03:52:30] <pskli> data.direction
[03:52:36] <pedda> oh..
[03:52:39] <pedda> :)
[03:52:41] <pedda> well
[03:52:50] <pedda> relatedTarget even simplifys my code to a maximum :)
[03:53:00] <pskli> ok ;)
[03:53:04] <pedda> or should it be a minimum ? ;)
[03:53:26] <pedda> like this.. and i'm done : var color = data.relatedTarget.data('body-class');
[03:53:48] <pedda> the previous aproach was about 10 - 15 lines :P
[03:53:56] <pskli> ok
[03:55:18] <pedda> it should be rather : var color = $(data.relatedTarget).data('body-class');
[03:55:23] <pedda> :)
[03:57:54] <pedda> pskli how did you figure out to access the dara via slide.bs.carousel ?
[03:58:12] <pedda> i mean.. is this a common approach?
[03:58:37] <pskli> http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#carousel-usage
[03:58:47] <pskli> there is an Events section
[03:58:54] <pedda> i know
[03:59:01] <pedda> but the .bs.carousel thing ?
[03:59:27] <pskli> the event name is listed in the doc
[03:59:34] <pedda> hmm.. if i would have logged the event itself, i might have discovered some bs node
[03:59:44] <pedda> which has a carousel child
[04:01:06] <pedda> i'm not that into jquery that's why i ask if this is common, to suggest some chained properties
[04:01:46] <Mehrdad> how can i get the scroll position relative to an element? scrollTop() doesn
[04:01:50] <pskli> the 'slide.bs.carousel' string is just an event name created by the carousel I think
[04:01:51] <Mehrdad> doesn't seem to work
[04:02:08] <pskli> Mehrdad: you might need to do some math !
[04:02:11] <Mehrdad> it returns 0 all the time for various elements
[04:02:32] <pskli> Mehrdad: use $(el).offset().top to get it's top position
[04:02:50] <pskli> its*
[04:02:50] <Mehrdad> well the element is partially hidden and can be scrolled, so i expect it to return >0
[04:04:36] <Cork> element.position().top will give you how far from the top of the scroll area it is
[04:05:13] <Mehrdad> ok, thanks
[04:05:22] <Cork> and yes it will be negative if it scrolled past it
[04:05:53] <daveAway> oh my word..
[04:06:14] <daveAway> $('.littleimage:nth-child(1)').remove(); from $(div).remove('.littleimage:nthchild(1)');
[04:06:22] <daveAway> fixed everything....
[04:07:32] <Cork> daveAway: remove always removes in the set of elements you have
[04:07:39] <Cork> daveAway: it doens't search for children
[04:07:57] <Cork> $(div).children().eq(0).remove() would work
[04:08:04] <daveAway> i cant figure out why it works fine in the original gallery i did
[04:08:10] <Cork> opps
[04:08:31] <Cork> $(div).find('.littleimage:nthchild(1)').remove()
[04:08:44] <Cork> daveAway: cause the div matches the selector
[04:09:16] <Cork> daveAway: $(div).remove('.littleimage:nthchild(1)') is the exact same thing as $(div).filter('.littleimage:nthchild(1)').remove()
[04:09:32] <Cork> while you want find
[04:09:41] <Rejected> hi there. I have a JSON string of which I want to have access to each individual elements in the form of "key-value" pairs
[04:10:08] <Rejected> here's what I'm trying but obviously it's not resulting in what I want it to be: http://jsfiddle.net/YvtL2/
[04:10:10] <daveAway> well, i learned 3-4 things in the persuit of finding this erro
[04:10:15] <daveAway> XD so it's not all bad
[04:10:47] <Rejected> how would I be able to get the "key - value" only for each item in the array?
[04:10:52] <daveAway> the thing is, now i got the base gallery working, its there to edit when i need it, can make it all fancy
[04:11:59] <Cork> raj: cause obj[i] doens't include all names
[04:12:01] <Cork> opps
[04:12:03] <Cork> *Rejected:
[04:12:12] <Cork> you only have one keyset per object
[04:14:38] <Cork> Rejected: http://jsfiddle.net/YvtL2/1/
[04:15:22] <Cork> Rejected: but why don't you just make one big object out of them?
[04:15:30] <Rejected> Cork I see, the way I had it each of the pairs are 1 separate object, right?
[04:15:46] <Rejected> that's why I was getting 1 item per line and all the others as 'undefined'
[04:16:00] <Cork> yes
[04:16:29] <Rejected> make 1 big object, how so?
[04:17:14] <Cork> Rejected: http://jsfiddle.net/YvtL2/2/
[04:17:26] <Rejected> the JSON string I'm getting is generated through PHP, which only transforms each row of a query to the JSON string.. how would I do it?
[04:17:36] <Rejected> ops, let me check it then
[04:17:40] <Cork> Rejected: by fixing hte php
[04:17:45] <Cork> *the
[04:22:32] <Rejected> alright, indeed a little tweaking of the PHP query did the trick, apparently. Thanks a lot Cork.
[04:22:49] <Cork> yw
[04:25:00] <Neon1024> Afternoon
[04:25:06] <Neon1024> I had a quick simple question
[04:25:24] <Neon1024> Using .each(function(i,e) { - inside the loop will $(this) == $(e) ?
[04:25:48] <Cork> depends on what you have of the left of .each
[04:25:59] <Cork> but if it is a jquery selector object, then yes
[04:26:04] <Neon1024> Cork: A tag $('table tr') for example
[04:26:16] <Neon1024> Cool, thanks, I thought so - just wasn't sure :)
[04:26:17] <Cork> $.each doesn't work like that
[04:26:23] <Cork> but $().each does
[04:26:36] <Neon1024> Ah, worth remembering!
[04:26:51] <Cork> also it's e,i on $.each :)
[04:27:02] <ravenzz> it is confusing :p
[04:27:10] <Neon1024> Agreed
[04:27:26] <Cork> ah, sorry
[04:27:29] <Cork> $.each is the same
[04:27:36] <Cork> it's $.map that differs
[04:27:38] <Neon1024> It's less confusing
[04:27:40] <Neon1024> ;)
[04:28:03] <ravenzz> Cork mh no $.each has the inverted arguments thing too
[04:28:19] <Cork> ravenzz: see the comment i just made :)
[04:28:53] <ravenzz> oh yeah pardon
[04:28:57] <Cork> ;P
[05:09:21] <rhalff> how do I listen for form changes? I'm trying keydown on the form itself but that doesn't work, I want to render a template each time a value in the form changes.
[05:09:32] <rhalff> Just use change() or something?
[05:11:00] <doug65536> rhalff: it should work...
[05:11:15] <doug65536> rhalff: let me try to make a fiddle
[05:11:40] <rhalff> doug65536, I think I have to grab all elements myself, I was hopeing I could just bind something to form :-)
[05:11:58] <doug65536> rhalff: you should be able to bind to the form. 1 sec
[05:12:43] <motaka2> Cork: is this valid?  $a = $('a');  $("body").on("click",$a,function(){....});
[05:12:59] <Cork> no
[05:13:13] <Cork> $("body").on("click",$a.selector,function(){....}); would be though
[05:13:27] <Cork> though then the first part would be pointless
[05:14:19] <doug65536> rhalff: http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/An2g2/2/
[05:19:13] <rhalff> doug65536, yeah should work, not a magic way though, besides this I should also get all form variables, the only method I can find is serialize(), but I don't want it serialized. To make your snippet work I would also have to iterate select and textarea etc.
[05:19:39] <doug65536> rhalff: I implemented a test of the event handler
[05:20:09] <doug65536> how else are you going to "render a template"? you have to look at the input when you detect a form change, right?
[05:20:37] <doug65536> rhalff: my test proves that events bubble up to the form element and you can catch all form changes there
[05:21:21] <rhalff> doug65536, true.. :-)
[05:22:10] <doug65536> rhalff: if I had more specifics of what "render a template" actually meant, I could give a more specific suggestion
[05:23:26] <rhalff> doug65536, render a template is not really the problem, I have a handlebars template and want to get the form values on each change, so I can render it each time, right now I'm just rendering it on submit, which is a bit lame.
[05:24:25] <doug65536> ok, so just remove that #result div code from my fiddle and call whatever code shows the template. you run something server side?
[05:24:40] <doug65536> I could show how to fetch a new "template" from the server with ajax and put it in the page
[05:24:43] <rhalff> doug65536, anyway it almost works, do you know a method that does the same as .serialize() but just returns the unserialized values?
[05:25:41] <Anny> hello.. could someone help me with simple question? what function i need to use together with "if"  for make If function work only in case if activates also another function.... something like function "If" will work only while another function exist?
[05:26:02] <doug65536> rhalff:  I can make a fiddle that simulates "submit" but does not reload the page and updates a div with whatever the server sends back
[05:26:22] <doug65536> rhalff: am I following what you mean by "template" ?
[05:27:44] <doug65536> rhalff: you can use .load(url) on an element to fetch content for an element
[05:28:00] <doug65536> rhalff: or you can use ajax and replace the content with the result
[05:28:19] <doug65536> rhalff: you would need to take care of overlapping ajax calls and discard old ones
[05:28:25] <rhalff> doug65536, don't wanna do that...
[05:29:10] <doug65536> rhalff: ok, I'm done guessing. good luck
[05:29:30] <rhalff> doug65536, no problem bot :p
[05:29:41] <franck> hello everybody
[05:30:09] <Neovea> hello all
[05:30:23] <Neovea> may I have some help please ?
[05:30:26] <doug65536> Anny: I would but you have ignored me every time I have responded to you
[05:30:52] <Trudko> Hi Guys bit general question about programming I have one tab on the screen. Tab contains three tables, each of those are loaded separately by ajax. After I load data , I set sorting of the columns. This happens all in one function which I call on click. My question is should I separate these function to have stronger cohesion?
[05:31:58] <Neovea> I tried to find by myself over the forum and a lot of different documentations ,and I guess I'm missing something about ajax events on new loaded elements of my dom
[05:32:14] <doug65536> Trudko: generally, I wouldn't suggest separating for the sake of separating. if you have duplicated code, then by all means, factor that out into a separate function
[05:32:51] <Neovea> I'm using the latest version of jquery and then .on() to trigger an event on new dom element
[05:33:08] <Anny> doug65536	sorry if it was looks like i ignored you
[05:33:43] <Neovea> but I'm affraid that it doesn't work at all, and as .live() is deprecated, I'm totally lost
[05:33:56] <Neovea> Could anyone helps please ?
[05:34:14] <Trudko> doug65536: isnt function cohesion always the best?
[05:35:31] <Trudko> doug65536: imo in this case, what if I  decide to load tables separately? then I would have to split it
[05:35:41] <doug65536> Trudko: functions are primarily for eliminating code duplication and, in javascript, for making closures. going overboard with functions just makes the code harder to follow and makes it easier to introduce bugs
[05:36:15] <doug65536> Trudko: if you have 3 copies of mostly duplicated code, then yes, there should be a funciton that eliminates the duplication and takes parameters for the bits that are different
[05:36:25] <Neovea> no one to give a hand ?
[05:36:32] <Trudko> doug65536: does it? It is easier to read function which have closely related code separated in functions -> loadTable1 , loadTable2, load table 3
[05:37:07] <doug65536> Trudko: having 3 duplicates of the code with the names loadTable1 /2 /3 gains you nothing
[05:37:19] <doug65536> are they 3 completely different functions?
[05:38:17] <Neovea> I stay connected if someone has time for helping me, send me a pm
[05:38:27] <doug65536> Trudko: I can't see your code so I can only guess. I expect the three of them to be almost identical code
[05:39:09] <doug65536> Neovea: use bind
[05:39:10] <Trudko> doug65536: well no actually from looking at the code there is something which I can separate and by splitting the methods I can prepare for future - what if they will want to load section separately. It is easier to read because if i Want to know what is loaded in tab I can read just three lines and it is clear by name of functions whats going on
[05:39:21] <doug65536> Trudko: never prepare for the future
[05:39:30] <doug65536> Trudko: if you need that in the future, do that in the future
[05:39:44] <doug65536> Trudko: do what your code needs to do now, now
[05:39:49] <doug65536> Trudko: "someday" never comes
[05:40:43] <doug65536> Trudko: anyway, I'm beginning to repeat myself. IMHO functions are for removing code duplication
[05:41:33] <Trudko> doug65536: have you read code complete?
[05:41:33] <henn1nk> http://www.senamion.com/blog/jmultiselect2side.html does someone knows a modern jquery alternative for this? this version throws errors
[05:41:38] <doug65536> Trudko: if 3 blocks of code are identical except a few bits in there, then make it a funciton, replace those different bits with parameters to the funciton, then call that function with the different bits as parameters
[05:42:01] <doug65536> Trudko: I have been programming in several languages for 26 years
[05:42:53] <doug65536> Trudko: if you want to make them separate functions, you don't need my permission. you asked for advice
[05:43:38] <Trudko> doug65536: yeah thanks I am trying to understand from what I read.
[05:45:21] <doug65536> Trudko: javascript code is very concise, and it has very powerful variable scoping rules, closures, etc. while the book may be accurate, it may not be directly applicable to javascript. everything depends on the scenario. a lot of js code is small and special purpose. expanding code like that because you might need something different "someday" isn't effective use of your time
[05:46:28] <Neovea> >doug65536 seems it doesn't work with bind
[05:48:01] <doug65536> Neovea: can you show your code? "doesn't work" is too vague, you might not be processing the correct events, you might be using $(this) where you should have used the event parameter .target, etc
[05:49:52] <Neovea> >doug65536
[05:49:52] <Neovea> $('#main span.media a').bind('click', function () {
[05:49:52] <Neovea>     console.log('click');
[05:49:52] <Neovea>     alert('hello');
[05:49:53] <Neovea>     return false;
[05:49:55] <Neovea> });
[05:49:58] <Neovea> according that <span class="media"><a><img element></a></span> is dynamicaly loaded with an ajax request
[05:50:18] <doug65536> Neovea: post on jsfiddle next time please
[05:50:38] <doug65536> Neovea: http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/SanF7/
[05:50:46] <doug65536> Neovea: try add button
[05:51:55] <Neovea> >doug65536 I've never used jsfiddle
[05:52:34] <doug65536> Neovea: try it. I really like it. makes investigating issues really quick and easy. if you post code there, I can fix it, save a copy, and give you link to fixed code
[05:52:45] <doug65536> each save saves a new fiddle
[05:53:17] <doug65536> top left is html, top right is css, bottom left is js, bottom right is resulting webpage
[05:54:23] <doug65536> Neovea: you can pick jquery to load at the top left
[05:54:54] <doug65536> Neovea: that code you put in irc is correct enough
[05:55:16] <doug65536> Neovea: if you are using bubbling, you don't put "span.media a" in there
[05:55:58] <doug65536> Neovea: you make the function() take a parameter, like function(event)  then in the body you can see which thing caused the event with event.target
[05:56:12] <doug65536> function body*
[05:59:22] <doug65536> Neovea: another option is to attach event handlers the usual way in your ajax callback
[06:01:08] <Neovea> >doug65536 so for exemeple (im using symfony2), I have differents ajax events, the principal load elements from my db
[06:02:03] <Neovea> >doug65536 on that event, wich is a function called function loadPage(uri, action, id)
[06:02:54] <doug65536> Neovea: I'll make demo of what I guess you need
[06:02:55] <Neovea> >doug65536 i must attach events like load or click for my new loaded elements ?
[06:03:06] <Neovea> >doug65536 ok
[06:03:12] <Neovea> >doug65536 thx
[06:14:33] <doug65536> Neovea: http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/9RmET/
[06:14:52] <Neovea> >doug65536 I check that right now
[06:17:43] <Neovea> >doug65536 all right I wasn't using any event handeler, as I'm newbie and didn't know how exactly to use it. I think I guess a bit more about that now. I will try to follow your example to understand and I'll come back to tell you then. Thanks a lot ;)
[06:17:58] <doug65536> Neovea: np
[06:25:23] <doug65536> Neovea: the first part is the part that answers how to catch clicks on items that are added later. the button click handler just generates fake links in the content section. the click handler creates a new <p> which contains a link <a> with a generated fake url
[06:32:58] <Goopyo> doug65536:
[06:33:06] <Goopyo> can I get a quick code review of this snippet in here? http://www.pnegahdar.com/customize-your-web/
[06:33:35] <Goopyo> want it to be idiomatic/correct js
[06:35:19] <Neovea> >doug65536 ok it works perfectly, I'm going to study much closer events handelers. Thank you again ;)
[06:36:01] <doug65536> Goopyo:  "$(document).ready(function()" is long form. "$(function()" means the same thing. either way is correct
[06:36:24] <Goopyo> ah didn't know that
[06:36:43] <Goopyo> I'm iffy about the == 0 check since it returns NaN and infinity otherwise
[06:36:47] <Goopyo> are those right?
[06:37:09] <doug65536> se === 0 means is it REALLY 0
[06:37:23] <vanev> Goopyo:
[06:37:33] <vanev> You might want to just check for existence?
[06:37:54] <Goopyo> well I'm parse inting right before so doesn't that gurante the type will be an int and make the triple = unecessary?
[06:38:07] <doug65536> js> print(undefined == 0)
[06:38:13] <Goopyo> oh shit
[06:38:15] <b-ot> doug65536: false
[06:39:04] <doug65536> js> print(parseInt("pile of garbage"))
[06:39:11] <b-ot> doug65536: NaN
[06:39:17] <doug65536> js> print(parseInt("pile of garbage") == 0)
[06:39:25] <b-ot> doug65536: false
[06:39:41] <Goopyo> getting the same things as b-ot
[06:39:52] <Goopyo> vanev: what do you mean?
[06:40:06] <doug65536> js> print(parseInt("pile of garbage") / parseInt("pile of garbage"))
[06:40:12] <b-ot> doug65536: NaN
[06:40:22] <Goopyo> lol doug65536 are you actually trying these?
[06:40:37] <vanev> Goopyo: if (!!se || !!le) { ratio =0; }
[06:41:15] <doug65536> Goopyo: I was verifying whether === was necessary or would make any difference
[06:41:45] <vanev> Goopyo: sorry, should only be 1 !.
[06:41:50] <vanev> My mistake.
[06:42:09] <Goopyo> !parseInt('yo') = True
[06:42:18] <Goopyo> which is good I guess
[06:42:33] <vanev> !(false) || !(undefined) || !(NaN) should all come back true.
[06:42:49] <vanev> js> print( !(false) )
[06:42:56] <Goopyo> yeah that looks better too
[06:42:57] <b-ot> vanev: true
[06:42:58] <vanev> js> print( !(undefined) )
[06:43:04] <b-ot> vanev: true
[06:43:05] <vanev> js> print( !(NaN) )
[06:43:13] <b-ot> vanev: true
[06:43:23] <Goopyo> dude I'm an idiot
[06:43:27] <Goopyo> I just realized thats a bot
[06:43:36] <vanev> Also, you should probably be declaring that ratio variable outside of the scope of the conditonal.
[06:43:37] <Cork> so should !0, !"" too
[06:43:51] <vanev> js> print(!0)
[06:43:55] <vanev> js> print(!"")
[06:43:57] <b-ot> vanev: true
[06:44:02] <b-ot> vanev: true
[06:44:12] <vanev> Cork: totally correct.
[06:44:17] <doug65536> probably one of the slowest bots ever but it's better than nothing :)
[06:44:24] <vanev> It's actually amazing.
[06:44:31] <Cork> doug65536: then you should have seen bot-t
[06:44:32] <vanev> doug65536: thanks so much for showing that.
[06:44:54] <Goopyo> http://pastebin.com/fB946Wyr
[06:45:10] <Goopyo> except the var on line 8
[06:45:36] <vanev> Yeah, just set that var on line 7 and move the if statement down.
[06:45:48] <vanev> Otherwise the code on line 10 will FREAK
[06:46:08] <Goopyo> I see
[06:46:48] <vanev> Yeah, you'll throw an error that ".toString()" is not a function of undefined.
[06:46:58] <Goopyo> http://pastebin.com/C6pGDzSs
[06:47:03] <Goopyo> final draft
[06:47:12] <vanev> Perfect.
[06:47:20] <Goopyo> thanks a bunch
[06:47:27] <vanev> Goopyo: no probelm.
[06:47:31] <vanev> problem*
[06:48:50] <doug65536> Goopyo: shouldn't it have a % at the end of line 10, before the </td>
[06:49:01] <doug65536> oh
[06:49:05] <Goopyo> its a ratio
[06:49:05] <doug65536> nevermind, it is a fraction
[06:49:08] <Goopyo> yeah
[06:49:09] <doug65536> like 0.03
[06:49:38] <vanev> Goopyo: you can also totally make that Javascript snippet into it's own Chrome extension. http://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted.html
[06:49:52] <vanev> Instead of having people download JScript Tricks.
[06:50:16] <Goopyo> I dont really care about TPB ratios, was just an example of how easy it is to make things more ideal
[06:50:18] <vanev> But that's probably a better discussion outside of the jQuery channel.
[06:50:24] <vanev> Sure.
[06:50:55] <Goopyo> alright thanks again guys
[06:59:17] <Anny> hello.. if someone can help me with this http://jsfiddle.net/XbuYH/  please?

[07:06:46] <anli> I want to set visibility: hidden on all divs that are partially invisible inside a certain div, is that possible?
[07:06:58] <Anny> doug65536 thank you a lot
[07:07:36] <doug65536> anli: yes
[07:07:53] <anli> Is there a selector for divs that are partially hidden?
[07:08:01] <doug65536> anli: can you be more specific about "partially invisible"
[07:08:08] <anli> Sorry
[07:08:18] <doug65536> anli: that are overflowing out of the element? and clipped off?
[07:08:27] <anli> They are overflow-hidden by their parent
[07:09:03] <doug65536> anli: why?
[07:09:18] <anli> It is a list of events, but I dont want to show partial events
[07:09:50] <doug65536> anli: is it overflow: scroll ?
[07:09:59] <anli> No, overflow: hidden
[07:10:10] <doug65536> anli: ok, I'll try to make a fiddle
[07:10:20] <anli> How nice of ya!
[07:15:14] <johanbr> BillCriswell: just wanted to say thank you for the help yesterday (with the jerky animation) - works perfectly!
[07:15:26] <BillCriswell> johanbr: No problem!
[07:18:07] <linagee_> does anyone use http://malsup.com/jquery/form/ ?  (It looks like they are not supporting the new done/fail/always. (instead they are using success/error/complete)
[07:18:40] <linagee_> (and they have pulls that are 6 months old, so I don't have a lot of motivation to contribute to their git.)
[07:20:53] <Joost> Is there a way to convert to JSON included in jQuery?
[07:20:57] <Joost> or do I need a standalone lib?
[07:21:47] <RRR2> delete the toJSON methods, maybe?
[07:21:59] <RRR2> I'm jk
[07:21:59] <RRR2> what do you mean

[07:27:20] <doug65536> linagee_: fork their git and make the changes in your own fork
[07:27:53] <Trudko> Guys if I use load to create table from servers data and I want to add tableSorter. I should do this in callback , because ajax call can take longer so i need to make sure that element is changed only after loaded were loaded?!
[07:30:31] <doug65536> Trudko: what's the question
[07:31:19] <doug65536> Trudko: you want do do something after load is finished? you can pass a complete callback to .load
[07:32:06] <Trudko> yes and I am asking if i have to to do that in order to prevent data being manipulated before Ajax call is finised.
[07:32:26] <doug65536> Trudko: yes, .load will return long before the data comes back
[07:33:04] <doug65536> .load won't wait
[07:37:10] <Trudko> doug65536: ok thx
[07:49:26] <Anny> doug65536 you can see what i added to code which u gave to me before... http://jsfiddle.net/8uWTU/ so that what i want to make almost finish just i have one problem... you can see if select there var1+ var3 in first input form will be value 2... but in second input form text hello will be only after push enter on keyboard  (on first input form) or type 2  to first input form by keyboard...
[07:49:28] <Anny> ...without var1+var3...  and i need that after select var1+var3 in first input form will be 2 and in second hello (wihtout push enter)
[07:50:13] <anli> There is a long delay from pressing F12 to get the firebug console...
[07:51:42] <doug65536> anli: try chrome debugger
[07:52:08] <doug65536> anli: both debuggers have issues where they hang a bit but chrome debugger seems to do it a lot less often
[07:55:17] <doug65536> Anny: is this what you were after: http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/8uWTU/1/
[07:55:33] <doug65536> Anny: I added line 7 to force a change event on #val1
[07:55:48] <jop008> I put this http://view.jquerymobile.com/1.3.2/dist/demos/widgets/footers/#&ui-state=dialog at the bottom of my page but it s rendered at the top
[07:58:41] <Aquaword> hi, how to "convert" this inline object literal to a variable? http://hastebin.com/neyuyecufo.coffee
[07:59:06] <doug65536> Aquaword: var data = {page:3};
[07:59:19] <Aquaword> tried that, doesnt work :/
[07:59:36] <doug65536> Aquaword: var xxx = { data: { page:3} };
[07:59:47] <Aquaword> and pass xxx?
[07:59:51] <doug65536> yes
[08:00:12] <doug65536> name doesn't matter - was voiding confusion with data:
[08:00:17] <doug65536> avoiding*
[08:00:34] <doug65536> could be var data = ... of course
[08:00:56] <jop008> no footer on my page with this <div data-role="footer">	<h4>Footer content</h4></div>
[08:00:59] <Anny> doug65536 thank you :D
[08:01:00] <Aquaword> doug65536, no
[08:01:04] <Aquaword> also not
[08:01:18] <doug65536> Aquaword: trust me, it works
[08:01:36] <Aquaword> I just tested, and dont
[08:01:50] <Aquaword> if I hardcode this obj.literal, that works
[08:01:54] <doug65536> Aquaword: then the problem is somewhere else
[08:02:01] <Aquaword> hm
[08:02:15] <doug65536> Aquaword: something silly like a missing ; ?
[08:03:41] <doug65536> js> var f = function(p) { print(p.data.page); }; var g = {data:{page:3}}; f(g); f({data:{page:3}});
[08:03:48] <b-ot> doug65536: 3 3
[08:03:58] <doug65536> Aquaword: ^^^
[08:04:19] <jop008> So how to make a footer with jqMobile?
[08:04:38] <Aquaword> doug65536, I prepare a paste a sec.
[08:04:55] <arschmitz> jop008: make a div with data-role="footer"
[08:05:12] <jop008> I did <div data-role="footer">	<h4>Footer content</h4></div>
[08:05:17] <jop008> but no footer
[08:05:28] <jop008> maybe inside page tag!
[08:06:16] <doug65536> jop008: jqm is nothing but problems imho
[08:06:26] <doug65536> jop008: but it does look nice
[08:06:39] <arschmitz> jop008: yes it must be inside you page
[08:06:51] <jop008> that is enough for finding cusotmer
[08:07:03] <arschmitz> doug65536: hope we can change your mind with 1.4 release a lot of big changes
[08:07:04] <jop008> I put it in page tag but no difference
[08:07:45] <doug65536> arschmitz: make toolbars modifiable (remove a menu item) without heroic reconstruction of the whole thing
[08:07:49] <jop008> Great 1.4 table grids? a carousel?
[08:07:59] <arschmitz> jop008: http://jsbin.com/ofuhaw/204/edit
[08:08:02] <arschmitz> shows a footer
[08:08:11] <arschmitz> doug65536: toolbars are widget now
[08:08:17] <arschmitz> so much easier to modify
[08:08:41] <arschmitz> doug65536: also they can be used outside pages now if you want them to be the same on every page or deal with them your self
[08:09:02] <Aquaword> doug65536, sorry I had an error on php side..
[08:09:05] <doug65536> arschmitz: look at the lengths I went to to remove something from a menu properly http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/bxfhM/
[08:09:15] <Aquaword> ty
[08:09:32] <arschmitz> jop008: carousel is on roadmap but not until 1.5 or 1.6 dont remember off the top of my head
[08:09:57] <arschmitz> doug65536: yeah thats not cool stuff like that is exactly what we are trying to fix
[08:10:04] <doug65536> arschmitz: navbar needs WAY more ability to modify it after it is created. the api almost nonexistent.
[08:10:15] <arschmitz> doug65536: do have to sadly admit we did not make it to re-writing nav bar
[08:10:28] <arschmitz> just ran out of time but its getting a full re-write for 1.5
[08:10:37] <spobat> is there an onDisabled event fired if a element gets disabled? ://
[08:10:40] <arschmitz> with many more options and a better api
[08:10:51] <doug65536> arschmitz: overall, jqm is pretty amazing and very nice looking
[08:11:31] <arschmitz> doug65536: thank you we appreciate it and do understand the problems ( to be honest in my own projects i use a rather modified version of navbar )
[08:11:43] <jop008> but how my footer can be done? I have a lot of dics and mayebe not in balance witheach other
[08:12:02] <arschmitz> and navbar is a priority we just ran out of time for 1.4
[08:12:37] <arschmitz> jop008: sorry with out knowing exactly what your trying to do its hard to say the best approach
[08:12:50] <doug65536> arschmitz: I also see mostly problems since my exposure to jqm is mostly trying to help people in #jquery. if I used it more myself I might have a different opinion :)
[08:13:12] <arschmitz> doug65536: yeah understandable
[08:15:15] <jop008> His is my fiddle http://jsfiddle.net/jop007/Zf5Dj/ why is footer not at the bottom of the page?
[08:19:40] <escher> jop008:  The footer isn't positioned by default. If you want it fixed to the bottom, you can add  data-position="fixed" to the footer div.  http://jsfiddle.net/Zf5Dj/1/
[08:20:15] <escher> jop008:  See also http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.2.0/docs/toolbars/bars-fixed.html and the bottom of http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.2.0/docs/toolbars/docs-footers.html.
[08:22:36] <jop008> Great
[08:25:31] <garbagecollectio> how do i loop through all input elements that are under a certain div?
[08:26:20] <doug65536> garbagecollectio: $('#certain_div :input')
[08:26:28] <garbagecollectio> .each?
[08:26:41] <doug65536> garbagecollectio: depends on what you want to do to those divs
[08:26:50] <doug65536> garbagecollectio: those inputs*
[08:26:51] <garbagecollectio> need to get their values and make a json object out o fit
[08:27:05] <garbagecollectio> is that space :input
[08:27:06] <garbagecollectio> ?
[08:27:08] <garbagecollectio> or just :input
[08:27:23] <jop008> how to make the tabs wider spreading the tabs to 100%? http://jsfiddle.net/jop007/Zf5Dj/2/
[08:27:39] <jop008> a navbar in the footer
[08:27:40] <doug65536> garbagecollectio: I use a space, makes it more obvious, probably works without the space, not sure
[08:28:01] <jop008> when is 1.4 around?
[08:30:00] <doug65536> garbagecollectio: something like var data = {}; $('#certain_div :input').each(function() { var item = $(this), name = item.attr('name'); if (name) { data[name] = item.val(); } });
[08:30:13] <doug65536> garbagecollectio: there is also $.serialize
[08:30:14] <arschmitz> jop008: 1.4 alpha-2 will be announced later today
[08:30:27] <garbagecollectio> serialize is for forms no?
[08:30:49] <doug65536> garbagecollectio: ok if there are no forms then scratch that
[08:30:58] <jop008> and  what is alpha-2 meaning will there a alpha-3 beta-x etc?
[08:31:14] <arschmitz> there will not be an alpha-3
[08:31:24] <arschmitz> there will be at least one beta and an RC
[08:31:29] <arschmitz> before final
[08:45:07] <jop008> Any idea how to rearange the tabs? http://jsfiddle.net/jop007/Zf5Dj/2/
[08:45:10] <doug65536> garbagecollectio: http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/qUs6h/  but it's weird, checkbox.val() is always "on"
[08:49:14] <hellgheast> Hello !
[08:49:37] <doug65536> can anyone explain why checkbox val() is always "on" even if it isn't checked http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/qUs6h/
[08:50:53] <jop008> use checked
[08:51:04] <doug65536> jop008:  I know that
[08:51:28] <doug65536> jop008: so I have to put some if (item.attr('type') == 'checkbox') crap in there?
[08:51:38] <doug65536> come on
[08:52:12] <doug65536> jquery isn't that stupid, is it?
[08:52:18] <doug65536> that's val()'s job
[08:53:44] <duch_kazatel> something tells me the w3 spec has a quirk for checkboxes.
[08:57:43] <garbagecollectio> $('#sidebar :input')
[08:57:48] <garbagecollectio> doug that also picks up button
[08:58:33] <doug65536> $('#sidebar :input').not('button, input[type="button"]')
[08:58:49] <garbagecollectio> what does the second param in not do?
[08:59:00] <doug65536> garbagecollectio: there is only one parameter
[08:59:02] <garbagecollectio> <button>
[08:59:09] <garbagecollectio> you have two there
[08:59:20] <doug65536> garbagecollectio: look again, that is a comma in the selector
[08:59:32] <garbagecollectio> wut
[08:59:57] <jop008> Yes but I have worked with Sencha touch also and there where the same kind of issues
[09:00:07] <jop008> SO jqM is not bad at all
[09:00:16] <garbagecollectio> that means there is nothing
[09:00:47] <garbagecollectio> .not removes everything
[09:00:55] <doug65536> no it doesn't
[09:01:06] <doug65536> it removes button tags and input that have type="button"
[09:01:23] <garbagecollectio> it doesn't find anything anymore
[09:01:48] <garbagecollectio> oh wait
[09:02:14] <doug65536> works for me
[09:02:18] <doug65536> http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/qUs6h/26/

[09:04:23] <garbagecollectio> doug65536: your right
[09:04:29] <garbagecollectio> my thing was in a different state
[09:04:29] <garbagecollectio> sorry
[09:05:42] <hellgheast> Does someone know how to add a button in javascript whitout using html ?
[09:05:53] <doug65536> garbagecollectio: .not(':button') also seems to work
[09:06:44] <doug65536> hellgheast: $('#somewhere).append($('<button>').text('This is a button!'))
[09:06:56] <doug65536> hellgheast: $('#somewhere').append($('<button>').text('This is a button!'))
[09:07:09] <duch_kazatel> hellgheast errr... whut?  you're editing the html in some way or another.
[09:08:54] <Zzaichik> who broke github
[09:09:08] <graphettion> Jesus
[09:09:19] <Zzaichik> damn you Jebus!
[09:09:25] <graphettion> lol
[09:09:30] <garbagecollectio> github is going
[09:09:31] <mobasher> Hi has anyone here used nicescroll jquery plugin?
[09:09:33] <garbagecollectio> github is being ddosed
[09:10:01] <hellgheast> strange
[09:10:11] <garbagecollectio> lots of companies affected
[09:11:05] <hellgheast> doug65536 it doesn't work
[09:11:56] <doug65536> hellgheast: you changed $('#somewhere') right?
[09:12:32] <doug65536> or you thought I would magically know where you wanted the button inserted in the DOM?
[09:13:50] <hellgheast> doug65536 I must give a position or another thing ?
[09:14:16] <doug65536> hellgheast: a selector that identifies where you want it inserted. can you show some of the html near where you want to insert it?
[09:15:26] <mobasher> I'v got a problem with nicescroll. i have tabs in the page but the nicescroll only works for the div in the first tab . i have 4 tabs and three of them have a div with the same class and i call nicescroll function on div's with that class
[09:16:31] <doug65536> mobasher: no idea about nicescroll, but you might want to try $('.someclass').each(function() { $(this).nicescroll_or_whatever(); })
[09:16:58] <hellgheast> doug65536 Unforunately no. i didn't understand quite good what can i add in a selector
[09:17:07] <mobasher> doug65536: thanks I have done that but still no difference :(
[09:17:09] <hellgheast> can i give a positon ?
[09:17:40] <doug65536> hellgheast: you can't show me some html? you realize that I couldn't care less about your page and that anyone can use curl or wget or view source on the page, right?
[09:18:11] <duch_kazatel> hellgheast are you familiar with CSS?
[09:18:52] <hellgheast> duch_kazatel not very much
[09:19:38] <duch_kazatel> ah, that explains it.  jquery's selector engine is based on CSS selectors.
[09:20:45] <hellgheast> and doug65536
[09:21:34] <hellgheast> It's not my code and i don't have time to clean it because i don't have acces to the source code.
[09:21:35] <doug65536> mobasher: you are doing that in document ready right?
[09:22:13] <doug65536> hellgheast: I didn't ask to see code. I asked if you could show the general area of the html where you wanted it inserted so I can make a selector for you
[09:22:16] <mobasher> doug65536: yes id do. it works fine for other pages and for body tag
[09:22:28] <mobasher> i have the problem in the tabs
[09:23:14] <hellgheast> if i examine the code yes i can show the area of the html
[09:23:17] <doug65536> hellgheast: something like "after the element with id "foo" or, at the end of the form with id "bar" or something
[09:26:08] <doug65536> mobasher: I actually don't like smooth scroll and I always turn it off fwiw
[09:38:18] <NielsNL> Hoi, i want to set some parameter why using dynamic loaded tabs. how can i do that in 1.9.2?
[09:38:48] <NielsNL> why = while
[09:39:07] <duch_kazatel> NielsNL - huh?  "set some parameter"?  do you have a fiddle?
[09:39:50] <NielsNL> one sec building it now
[09:42:07] <jiffe98> so I have this function which makes an ajax call http://nsab.us/public/jquery
[09:42:41] <jiffe98> in the success function I want to be able to do some custom stuff and then call the callback function that I pass into this function but it appears to be unavailable
[09:44:36] <NielsNL> duch_kazatel: http://jsfiddle.net/hvR4a/1/ <= it is not working
[09:46:13] <duch_kazatel> NielsNL - could you fix thap up and remove the php?
[09:46:14] <duch_kazatel> ;)
[09:46:48] <duch_kazatel> and what are you trying to accomplish, exactly?
[09:48:02] <NielsNL> What i want is that when the tab is loaded there should be an extra data parameter telling what to load exactly
[09:48:06] <jiffe98> I've read of others doing something similar to myself but in their case the callback function is available so I'm not sure why it is undefined for me
[09:49:37] <fission6> is there any handy small libraries out there to do a Total Row for a table and sum up table columns?
[09:49:50] <duch_kazatel> NielsNL - it's hard to help when I can't run the example. but this looks like a jqueryUI question which I am, sadly, not well versed in at all.
[09:50:05] <NielsNL> fixing it atm
[09:50:06] <tamarche> fission6, I don't think you would need a library for that
[09:50:17] <fission6> something ight
[09:50:24] <tamarche> "ight"
[09:50:28] <NielsNL> duch_kazatel: try again: http://jsfiddle.net/hvR4a/4/
[09:50:44] <Al1> when running this file - in chrome i see an error that says "Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected identifier" - https://gist.github.com/albertpak/b7534045a942273ae705 - whats wrong with it? can someone help pls?
[09:51:14] <NielsNL> duch_kazatel: yes it is a jqueryUI issue indeed
[09:55:43] <tamarche> With regards to Hungarian notation, do some people use the dollar sign in conjunction with the underscore for a local variable?
[09:56:06] <tamarche> Or is it exclusively one or the other?
[09:59:04] <Al1> https://gist.github.com/albertpak/b7534045a942273ae705 - what can be causing "syntax error: unexpected identifier"
[10:01:04] <duch_kazatel> Al1 what line?
[10:01:46] <Al1> @duch_kazatel, in console, that error is below  $.validationEngineLanguage.newLang(); (#198)
[10:01:55] <Al1> 198*
[10:04:03] <duch_kazatel> al1 it's hard to see why without running it, but I'll guess you're not closing something somewhere.
[10:04:30] <Al1> @duch_kazatel - you mean like a missing } or ) or a comma?
[10:04:35] <jsc802> hi i have a beginner jquery question
[10:05:22] <duch_kazatel> al1 yeah without running it not sure, but that's my shot in the dark guess.
[10:05:42] <jsc802> if all my div.post have hidden div.tag in them and i want to show div.tag on hover, how do i reference that
[10:05:46] <Al1> ok i'll run through it again and see whats going on, thank you
[10:06:18] <jsc802> so far i have $(".post a").hover(function(){ $(this).next('.tag')....
[10:06:23] <jsc802> is there an easier way to do it?
[10:07:49] <tamarche> jsc802, just say $('.tag').show() in your hover function
[10:08:07] <jsc802> but that would select all .tags in the page, no?
[10:08:34] <tamarche> Ah, $(this).closest('.post').find('.tag').show()
[10:09:57] <jsc802> ah, thank you
[10:10:37] <kborchers> jsc802: you can probably simplify to something like https://gist.github.com/kborchers/efef20474334679755ed
[10:10:56] <MalfaitRobin> Hello is here someone who worked with DataTables and "sDom", because I'm stuck
[10:11:08] <tamarche> kborchers, that would bind the event to hovering over the div, not the link

[10:33:18] <zizzl> Hey guys, so in the Console of Chrome's Dev Tools.. It will show an error in something but I know it's something before that code that holds the actual error, how do we know exactly where it is? The error I see is only a domino effect from the broken script
[10:34:20] <blindMoe> zizzl: sometimes you can click the arrow on the left to get a mini stack trace
[10:35:25] <zizzl> blindMoe, ah I see that but it's still on the same js file and I know there's really nothing wrong with it
[10:35:51] <blindMoe> yeah it doesn't always go far enough up the tree to be truly useful
[10:35:58] <aubreypwd> Hey guys, does anyone know why a variable might not be sending to $.ajax ?
[10:36:04] <blindMoe> zizzl: set breakpoints and see when the error happens
[10:36:58] <zizzl> I know how to set breakpoints but don't fully understand them
[10:45:31] <doug65536> zizzl: set it to break on exception - click the stop sign thing at the bottom
[10:46:04] <doug65536> ignore the ones that happen in jquery at the start
[10:46:19] <doug65536> jquery does some weird stuff to detect broken browsers
[10:50:49] <moparisthebest> I'm trying to remove all click handlers from an anchor, I read to try .off() or .unbind(), but neither work: http://jsfiddle.net/Dm7UU/1/
[10:51:12] <moparisthebest> maybe it's because the event was not registered in the first place with jquery? it's in onClick instead?
[10:55:04] <sekyms> anyone know how to get firebug to stop stopping script execution when it hits a problem
[10:55:08] <sekyms> it never used to do this
[10:56:19] <duch_kazatel> sekyms - hit the orange || thinger in the upper left under the bug icon
[10:56:31] <moparisthebest> looks like this.onclick = undefined; does what I need, I *guess* thats' the right way to handle it
[10:56:57] <sekyms> oh duch_kazatel thank you so much
[10:57:03] <sekyms> that was driving me crazy
[10:57:08] <duch_kazatel> sekyms np :)
[10:57:10] <sekyms> and making it difficult to use the internet
[10:57:25] <duch_kazatel> lol
[10:57:33] <duch_kazatel> makes you realize how lazy other devs are :)
[10:57:57] <sekyms> well even google
[10:57:59] <sekyms> wtf
[10:58:12] <sekyms> i couldn't focus on the search input
[10:58:53] <MalfaitRobin> Anyone who has a nice jquery "file manager"?
[11:58:43] <awc737> Can I do this?
[11:58:51] <awc737> $(element).live('load, function(e){
[11:58:57] <awc737> $(element).live('load', function(e){
[11:59:21] <duch_kazatel> awc737 use .on when possible.
[11:59:22] <duch_kazatel> not live.
[11:59:46] <duch_kazatel> and what are you trying to do?  check when an element loads?
[11:59:48] <awc737> I know, where in jQ 1.6 or something here
[12:00:17] <awc737> yes basically, but I use this function for a number of things, .live('click', 'submit', etc
[12:00:22] <awc737> so to just pass in a load string would be ideal
[12:00:26] <awc737> rather than using a different function
[12:02:13] <awc737> so can you think of anything to go in the live() method, which would fire on page load?
[12:02:34] <duch_kazatel> awc - on pageload?  try wrapping everything in a document ready...
[12:02:53] <awc737> I want to know of something that works with the live method
[12:03:04] <duch_kazatel> $(function() {console.log( "ready!" );});
[12:03:40] <awc737> i have a hundred tracking variables, with an element and trigger
[12:03:47] <awc737> most of them are on click, on submit, on change, etc
[12:04:08] <awc737> this one particular tracking variable is just on load, I want to know if I can use my same config and method
[12:04:12] <awc737> if not, just let me know
[12:04:46] <awc737> the method being, binding a .live('event' onto the element
[12:06:08] <awc737> so that's not possible with live() ?
[12:06:42] <duch_kazatel> i'm not sure exactly what you're trying to accomplish, sorry.  it looks like you want to use live() to detect document ready?
[12:06:58] <awc737> specifically an element being ready
[12:07:10] <awc737> yes I know there are other ways, but I'm asking about when using live()
[12:07:38] <duch_kazatel> aaaaah.
[12:07:53] <duch_kazatel> iirc you can't bind .live() to an element that doesn't yet exist.
[12:08:21] <awc737> I thought that's what live was for, if I just used .bind() dynamic elements weren't binding
[12:08:32] <awc737> but I think live does it even before they're created
[12:09:35] <duch_kazatel> live subscribes to a given element and binds an event listener.  if the element doesn't exist when you try to bind, it silently fails.
[12:10:15] <shoky> live does $(document).on(...
[12:10:35] <shoky> did*
[12:11:04] <shoky> and relies on the event bubbling up to the document element
[12:11:16] <shoky> and load events don't bubble i think
[12:11:35] <duch_kazatel> pretty sure they do.
[12:11:57] <duch_kazatel> looking though]
[12:11:57] <awc737> pretty sure .live works all the time for me when the elements are dynamically created\
[12:12:00] <awc737> even after document.ready
[12:12:28] <duch_kazatel> awc737 you're probably binding after the elemtns exist.
[12:12:31] <duch_kazatel> *elements
[12:12:37] <shoky> awc737:  $(selector).live(eventname, fn) does $(document).on(eventname, selector, fn)
[12:12:52] <duch_kazatel> shoky - he wants to use .live()
[12:12:56] <duch_kazatel> not sure why though.
[12:13:06] <duch_kazatel> wait wtf does live really do that?
[12:13:06] <goldr046> .live() is removed from the latest, riht
[12:13:12] <duch_kazatel> he's using 1.6.
[12:13:13] <shoky> goldr046: yes
[12:13:25] <shoky> duch_kazatel yes that's what live does
[12:13:32] <duch_kazatel> woah.  that's funky.
[12:13:50] <goldr046> long live live()
[12:13:54] <duch_kazatel> :(
[12:14:06] <awc737> lol
[12:14:09] <duch_kazatel> once i learned .on() I preferred its syntax.
[12:14:17] <awc737> soo , anyway I can use it on load
[12:14:20] <awc737> or ready or whatever
[12:15:08] <goldr046> i have a question, i've read people who say .on() should be used instead of .bind()
[12:15:11] <goldr046> is this true?
[12:15:25] <awc737> I believe .on will catch dynamically created elements
[12:15:27] <duch_kazatel> awc737 looks like it.  it's listening to the document for any events that bubble to it.
[12:15:28] <awc737> .bind they have to already exist
[12:15:30] <shoky> goldr046: .bind() is just a shortcut to one usage of .on()
[12:15:44] <goldr046> i guess you can manage the memory lifecycle better
[12:16:07] <goldr046> so .bind() uses the same amount of memory as .on()?
[12:16:44] <goldr046> i would think .on() would be much more intensive than .bind() and so should only be used when you think dynamically created elements could occur
[12:17:00] <goldr046> but i don't really know
[12:17:12] <duch_kazatel> .bind() uses a version of .on() under the hood.  it's a convenience.
[12:17:13] <shoky> goldr046: both .bind() and .on() just add an event handler to the selected elements
[12:17:46] <goldr046> but .on() watches the DOM to see if you create new elements that require binding, right?
[12:17:49] <shoky> .on() can be used with a special selector argument, that'll check if the event was bubbled from an element matching that selector. this is event delegation
[12:17:57] <goldr046> isn't that expensive?
[12:17:57] <shoky> .on() doesn't "watch" the DOM
[12:18:03] <shoky> there is no watching going on
[12:18:11] <goldr046> ok
[12:18:41] <goldr046> then how does jquery know that a new element has been created that needs to have behaviors bound to it?
[12:18:45] <duch_kazatel> goldr046 it can be - doing something like $('body').on('click', 'a', function(e){...}) means you're checking EVERY click and seeing it it was on an A.
[12:18:49] <shoky> goldr046: it doesn't
[12:18:54] <duch_kazatel> goldr046 - bubbling.
[12:18:55] <Gmac_> i have a pop out form that submits via ajax
[12:19:00] <vanev> goldr046: You would need to re-add the events.
[12:19:01] <Gmac_> unfortunately the pop out closes after submission even if it failed
[12:19:05] <shoky> goldr046:  the event bubbles up to its ancestor elements and it's caught there
[12:19:13] <goldr046> ohok
[12:19:14] <Gmac_> the user must reopen the pop out to see if it failed and they won't know to do that
[12:19:21] <Gmac_> how can i keep it open
[12:19:38] <goldr046> so you only get future nodes to get previously-defined behaviors through event delegation
[12:19:44] <vanev> Gmac_: You should be closing the element in a callback.
[12:19:48] <duch_kazatel> Gmac_ you should bind the close event ot to the success event only.  if it fails, update the modal instead.
[12:19:54] <shoky> goldr046: yah
[12:19:56] <vanev> Just check to see if it worked.
[12:20:00] <duch_kazatel> goldr046 that's the smart way to do it.
[12:20:05] <goldr046> ohh
[12:20:05] <vanev> duch_kazatel: This guy's got it.
[12:20:25] <Gmac_> hmmm… I'm not in full control I'm using gravity forms i just designed the form and the way it pops out
[12:20:29] <duch_kazatel> the other way to do it is to bind directly to the element when you create it, but that's boring.
[12:20:31] <duch_kazatel> lol
[12:20:42] <goldr046> so if i do this $('div').on(function() {})
[12:20:54] <duch_kazatel> on what?
[12:21:00] <shoky> then you won't be catching much
[12:21:03] <goldr046> future occurences of <div> do not get that function bound to it
[12:21:07] <duch_kazatel> .on('eventname', function(){})
[12:21:13] <goldr046> oh, right, sorry
[12:21:20] <vanev> goldr046: With .on, you can pass a selector with the event name and function.
[12:21:49] <duch_kazatel> and no.  if you instead did something like $('#parentElement').on('click', 'div', function(){});
[12:22:06] <duch_kazatel> however, note that clicking within anything inside of the div will also trigger that.
[12:22:12] <duch_kazatel> unless you stop propogation
[12:22:18] <goldr046> right, got it
[12:23:12] <Gmac_> ok i figured out whats happening
[12:23:15] <duch_kazatel> my biggest "ooooh" moment with javascript was when i finally understood events.
[12:23:21] <Gmac_> i give the form class of 'open'
[12:23:22] <goldr046> $('span').live('click', function() {})   would have worked for all future spans
[12:23:31] <Gmac_> and the ajax submission takes off that class
[12:23:42] <duch_kazatel> goldr046 - sure, if you're using older versions of jquery :)
[12:23:48] <shoky> goldr046: that's just:  $(document).on('click', 'span', function() {})
[12:23:50] <goldr046> i see
[12:23:57] <Gmac_> so how can i tell ajax to leave that class on
[12:24:09] <vanev> Gmac_: Can you post the code?
[12:24:10] <goldr046> i get it now, thanks
[12:24:36] <Gmac_> the ajax code is made by gravity form so i cannot edit it directly… i can only add my own script to it
[12:25:31] <shoky> btw load event doesn't bubble
[12:25:35] <goldr046> i guess .on() is more flexible
[12:25:43] <duch_kazatel> shoky really?
[12:25:47] <shoky> ye
[12:26:11] <duch_kazatel> oh for the document.
[12:26:14] <goldr046> where would it bubble up from
[12:26:25] <shoky> duch_kazatel: not just to the document
[12:26:25] <goldr046> oh, it's the top level
[12:26:26] <duch_kazatel> that's because it's at the uppermost DOM node, right?
[12:26:42] <Gmac_> http://pastebin.com/2qPrq7V5
[12:26:43] <goldr046> can't bubble from the top
[12:26:43] <duch_kazatel> has nowhere to bubble to
[12:26:49] <goldr046> shit rolls downhill
[12:26:59] <duch_kazatel> actually, if you're old IE...
[12:27:00] <shoky> i meant like for an image
[12:27:37] <shoky> thought that's what this was about, nvm
[12:27:56] <goldr046> oh
[12:27:59] <duch_kazatel> images don't use "load" they use "onload" don't they
[12:27:59] <duch_kazatel> ?
[12:28:12] <Gmac_> so can anyone help me
[12:28:13] <shoky> onload isn't an event name
[12:28:26] <shoky> they use "load" event
[12:28:52] <duch_kazatel> oh derp read that backwards.
[12:29:05] <duch_kazatel> "One part of the problem: The event is not called onload, but load."
[12:29:13] <duch_kazatel> parsing too fast.
[12:29:32] <shoky> drp
[12:30:00] <duch_kazatel> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM_Client_Object_Cross-Reference/DOM_Events#Events
[12:30:03] <duch_kazatel> well i'll be .
[12:30:04] <duch_kazatel> weird.
[12:31:34] <Gmac_> anyone?
[12:31:41] <Gmac_> i posted the code
[12:31:43] <awc737> wait, so how can I bind to a dynamic element being loaded, before .on existed?
[12:31:48] <Gmac_> http://pastebin.com/2qPrq7V5
[12:32:02] <Gmac_> can i just use ajaxcomplete to reapply the open class?
[12:32:29] <shoky> awc737: you can't bind to a general element being "loaded". there is no load event for regular elements
[12:32:50] <awc737> I want to get the .text() of an span element
[12:32:58] <awc737> after it loads. what are my options
[12:33:15] <duch_kazatel> you can check the subtreemodified event iirc.
[12:33:51] <shoky> that's deprecated
[12:33:58] <duch_kazatel> hah
[12:34:24] <shoky> and mutationobservers are not supported everywhere
[12:34:49] <awc737> hmm tricky
[12:35:07] <shoky> awc737 what does "after it loads" mean
[12:35:42] <awc737> the element is created
[12:35:51] <shoky> who's creating it
[12:35:56] <awc737> ajax
[12:36:01] <shoky> ajax doesn't create stuff
[12:36:02] <shoky> code does
[12:36:05] <shoky> your code/
[12:36:06] <shoky> ?
[12:36:10] <awc737> but I don't have anything to do with that plugin, and I don't want to mess with it
[12:36:13] <shoky> a plugin, then
[12:36:15] <awc737> not my code
[12:36:23] <shoky> you might have to...
[12:36:35] <awc737> yeah, it seems I will probably
[12:36:46] <shoky> good plugins should support hooks/callbacks for when they do stuff, like.. create elements
[12:37:46] <vanev> shoky: "good plugins" << we don't think that's asking too much?
[12:38:01] <awc737> haha
[12:38:14] <awc737> in this case it is, it's not some distributable plugin, just someone else code
[12:39:05] <shoky> fun
[13:04:25] <kgmo> my first time in irc.  Any rules I should follow?
[13:04:35] <kgmo> hello…btw. ;)
[13:04:35] <duch_kazatel> don't be a dick.
[13:04:38] <duch_kazatel> stay on topic.
[13:04:58] <shoky> `ask
[13:04:59] <b-ot> shoky: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[13:05:35] <kgmo> so I can just post code and ask for help?
[13:05:55] <duch_kazatel> don't post straight into the channel.
[13:06:01] <duch_kazatel> use jsfiddle, but yeah.
[13:06:14] <kgmo> perfect. thanks all for the tips.
[13:06:32] <duch_kazatel> be all like "hey guys my thing x should do think y, but instead it's doing thing z?  ideas?  here's my code: {link to fiddle}"
[13:07:50] <kgmo> @b-ot Love the link, thx for sharing.

[13:14:46] <bjorn_> kgmo: it currently doesnt have one
[13:17:56] <kgmo> I didn't look at ur code, just from experience.  Read this.

[13:19:23] <bjorn_> kgmo: trying now
[13:19:36] <Al1> github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload
[13:20:18] <Al1> need help figuring out how to do a single file upload with a preview
[13:20:56] <bjorn_> kgmo: now the site just breaks lol
[13:21:02] <bjorn_> kgmo: on iphone
[13:24:20] <Al1> in my app, i got use profile - and would like to implement jquery file upload (blueimp) to give user ability to change their profile photo
[13:24:58] <Al1> then i found http://jasny.github.io/bootstrap/javascript.html#fileupload - and tried it, works, but how can that be done with this one: https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload
[13:37:10] <b0u1d3r>  i am using some simple jquery to show/hide fields in a drupal web form. for some reason if i move the block to ANY page besides the web form, my code works just fine, but on the web form page it doesn't work at all… I'm puzzled. Any ideas?
[13:40:15] <Zzaichik> try using .on('click', function() {}) maybe?
[13:44:57] <vacho> how come it does not recognize (this) http://pastebin.com/kpxTtEWF ??
[13:51:32] <garbagecollectio> how can i check for just a blank object?
[13:51:53] <tw2113> if ( obj.length > 0 ) { //do something }
[13:52:49] <grafi> jquery also has a .isEmptyObject method
[13:56:40] <doug65536> anyone here know chinese?
[13:57:21] <doug65536> tell me what this means 节省
[13:57:22] <grafi> food?
[13:57:34] <BillCriswell> doug65536 http://translate.google.com/
[13:57:44] <BillCriswell> It means "Save"
[13:57:48] <grafi> Save apparently
[13:57:53] <doug65536> which save
[13:57:55] <grafi> BillCriswell speaks chinese ^^
[13:57:58] <doug65536> did you use translation
[13:58:06] <doug65536> save like save my life? or what
[13:58:17] <BillCriswell> If you put a space between the two things it says "Savings"
[13:58:18] <grafi> save like save
[13:58:19] <grafi> oô
[13:58:31] <doug65536> haha very funny
[13:58:35] <BillCriswell> Not sure how this voodoo works.
[13:58:35] <doug65536> I'm not a moron
[13:59:07] <grafi> if you put 2 spaces between the symbols it says Airplane
[13:59:11] <grafi> xD
[13:59:17] <BillCriswell> didn't say airplane for me
[13:59:25] <doug65536> save money? save a life? save a hockey puck? save a document?
[13:59:26] <grafi> for me neither
[14:00:02] <BillCriswell> with a space between the two it says "savings"
[14:00:06] <BillCriswell> without the space just "save"
[14:35:22] <lion> Hello, I'm trying to get the third column of the last row of a table.  Is there any better way to select it than $($('#example tr:last td')[2])
[14:38:14] <BillCriswell> lion: $('#example tr:last td:eq(2)') I think?
[14:38:26] <BillCriswell> Never really seen your approach before?
[14:38:56] <lion> Yeah, it's pretty hacky, hahah, that's why I'm hoping for something better
[14:39:04] <sunbeam> why does't a .row in bootstrap  have a default padding bottom
[14:39:06] <sunbeam> and top
[14:40:13] <BillCriswell> sunbeam: Let me consult my crystal ball.
[14:41:47] <lion> BillCriswell: Perfect!  Thanks, much more elegant
[14:42:50] <f0ster> is it safe to use a pseudo selector for cross browser (i.e. ie), on something like $('select option:selected')
[14:43:35] <BillCriswell> f0ster: Yes. If you want the select's value though it might be a little clearer to just do $('select').val()
[14:43:48] <grafi> sunbeam seems to forget that this in fact is not #bootstrap
[14:43:48] <grafi> xD
[14:44:09] <aitiba> hi
[14:44:27] <tw2113> grafi, most people seem to think #html5 is a general webdev channel
[14:44:49] <tw2113> and any sort of odd js behavior gets asked about there
[14:45:03] <aitiba> how can I get the errors value of this json {"errors":null} please?
[14:45:18] <f0ster> BillCriswell: yeah but that returns the value and I want the text
[14:45:28] <BillCriswell> f0ster: Ah, ok!
[14:45:33] <f0ster> ty though
[14:45:58] <BillCriswell> Welcome.
[14:46:12] <BillCriswell> aitiba: .errors
[14:46:34] <BillCriswell> so if it's like... var response = {"errors":null}; you'd want response.errors
[14:47:29] <plambwk> BillCriswell is a pretty sick name
[14:47:31] <aitiba> I get undefined
[14:47:32] <aitiba> success: function(data){
[14:47:33] <aitiba>   alert(data.errors);
[14:47:33] <aitiba>  }});
[14:47:33] <plambwk> you should be a rapper
[14:47:37] <plambwk> or like a DJ
[14:47:40] <BillCriswell> aitiba: There you go.
[14:47:49] <BillCriswell> plambwk: Can't say I've ever heard that haha
[14:48:02] <plambwk> lol
[14:49:46] <BillCriswell> I think I just time traveled. It was like... 3:00 5 minutes ago.
[14:51:13] <BillCriswell> what the hell was i doing.
[14:54:51] <BillCriswell> Later on!
[15:00:28] <Ericx2x> How long should jquery take to learn from scratch?
[15:03:16] <LinuxPhreak> I'm new to jquery and I'm having trouble porting my javascript http://pastebin.com/R11AVW6T can someone help with this
[15:05:08] <doug65536> LinuxPhreak: result? where did that come from
[15:09:38] <jehoshua02> I'm having a problem: jquery can't select element loaded with ajax
[15:10:53] <doug65536> LinuxPhreak: use .html() to get innerHTML
[15:10:59] <LinuxPhreak> doug65536: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18199208/change-text-in-text-field-according-to-link-that-has-been-clicked answer one was working now I need a slight tweak
[15:11:45] <doug65536> LinuxPhreak: what your script does doesn't make a lot of sense though
[15:12:03] <doug65536> you assign a bunch of html as value?
[15:12:17] <doug65536> oh it's just the word Boy
[15:14:39] <LinuxPhreak> doug65536: The last link I shared is something like what I want with somewhat of a twist I want to get #boy with the # followed by Hello + sometext to show in the input box

[15:19:07] <jehoshua02> So I'm adding something to the dom with .append() but then can't select the new elements with jquery
[15:19:21] <jehoshua02> Any clues?
[15:19:34] <doug65536> jehoshua02: show code
[15:20:32] <jehoshua02> Um: $('#some-element').append(somehtml); $('#some-element .some-child');
[15:21:30] <jehoshua02> It's obviously part of a large problem, so I'm still trying to rule out what it might be. Want to know if anybody else has experienced a problem like this.
[15:21:33] <doug65536> jehoshua02: some bug on some line somewhere in your script
[15:21:51] <jehoshua02> I can inspect the element I'm trying to select and it's there.
[15:22:22] <doug65536> jehoshua02: did you look in console for exceptions that cause browser to abandon your script?
[15:22:36] <jehoshua02> But when I run the select jquery in the console, I get empty object
[15:23:17] <doug65536> jehoshua02: well I can tell you that it works and the problem is a bug in your code
[15:23:19] <jehoshua02> On fresh page, I can select and get the expected object
[15:23:42] <jehoshua02> But then after html is appended from ajax, then I can't select
[15:24:15] <doug65536> jehoshua02: show code
[15:24:36] <jehoshua02> I'm not going to waste my time developing a contrived example
[15:24:51] <jehoshua02> it's part of a large messy code base that I am unable to show
[15:24:53] <duch_kazatel> jehoshua02 you're asking us to shoot in the dark.
[15:25:00] <doug65536> jehoshua02: I'm not going to waste my time trying to help a lazy ass
[15:25:20] <jehoshua02> I'm asking if anybody else has run into a similar problem, ever, with selecting content loaded via ajax
[15:25:34] <jehoshua02> That's all I want to know
[15:25:58] <jehoshua02> If you guys haven't seen that before, I'm done here
[15:26:00] <doug65536> jehoshua02: I know you would love us to tell you that it is a known issue but I already told you that it works, and since you won't show code you won't get any help
[15:26:03] <duch_kazatel> and we can't help you because we don't know what the markup and javascript is doing.
[15:27:04] <jehoshua02> I think you misunderstand my expectations.
[15:27:20] <doug65536> nobody wants a fully working, runnable repro
[15:27:21] <jehoshua02> This is how conversation should have went: Have you run into this? Nope. Ok thanks.
[15:27:26] <doug65536> just show the ajax code and nearby code
[15:27:33] <duch_kazatel> We don't even know wtf you ran into.
[15:27:46] <duch_kazatel> we are unable to comment because it'
[15:27:50] <duch_kazatel> *it's shooking in the dark.
[15:28:08] <jehoshua02> Scroll up
[15:28:15] <doug65536> I told you "it works"
[15:28:20] <jehoshua02> Or maybe you entered after my first comment?
[15:28:28] <duch_kazatel> yup, i saw that.  you're appeding some stuff and then trying to access it via jquery.
[15:28:34] <jehoshua02> Anyway, I take it you haven't run into that's all I wanted to know.
[15:28:52] <duch_kazatel> lmao we don't know if we have because we can't see what the actual problem might be.
[15:29:27] <doug65536> jehoshua02: you want a guess? my guess is you are expecting the ajax to be done on the line after your ajax call
[15:30:05] <jehoshua02> ok ok, I get some html via ajax, then .append(), then want to select something: sounds like a pretty common scenario that I thought maybe 1 out of 837 people in this chat would have run into sometime during their career as a JQuery user … ???
[15:30:37] <jehoshua02> I'm selecting long after the content has been appended.
[15:30:44] <Technical_13> What do you mean select?
[15:30:53] <Technical_13> Click on?
[15:30:57] <duch_kazatel> are you "selecting" with the "done" callback?
[15:31:00] <jehoshua02> $('#some-element .some-child');
[15:31:17] <jehoshua02> That's what I mean by select
[15:31:20] <duch_kazatel> ...
[15:31:36] <Technical_13> Inside the function the apoends?
[15:31:40] <jehoshua02> When I run that in the console I get empty object, even though I can see/inspect using Firebug that the element is there.
[15:31:56] <duch_kazatel> that will select all elements with the class "some-child" that are within the element with id ID "some-element"
[15:31:57] <doug65536> jehoshua02: evaulate just $ in console
[15:32:02] <doug65536> jehoshua02: what comes up
[15:32:54] <Technical_13> You would have to select in a different function than you append in and make sure first function is done before calling second.
[15:33:00] <jehoshua02> function()
[15:33:29] <duch_kazatel> okay, so what happens when you JUST do $('#some-element');?
[15:33:32] <duch_kazatel> what do you get?
[15:33:33] <Snerf> I would check what $('#some-element').html() shows. see if it is really appended
[15:33:42] <jehoshua02> Technical_13: sorry, the ajax call and the append happen *before* I'm trying to select
[15:34:10] <duch_kazatel> jehoshua02 - just because the code appears after the ajax call in the js file doesn't mean that's actually working.
[15:34:17] <jehoshua02> In the console, should say something like object [ #some-element .some-child ] or something
[15:34:40] <duch_kazatel> jehoshua02 - try getting just that aprent element.
[15:35:48] <nicky> whats good everyone
[15:36:26] <LinuxPhreak> doug65535: Something along these lines http://jsfiddle.net/jHXYQ/4/
[15:37:15] <doug65536> LinuxPhreak: you got the link I sent you right?
[15:37:49] <LinuxPhreak> send it again?
[15:38:00] <doug65536> LinuxPhreak: http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/jHXYQ/2/
[15:38:08] <nicky> anyone familiar with this script? http://nicinabox.com/superslides/#1
[15:38:17] <nicky> need a little help with it
[15:38:22] <doug65536> LinuxPhreak: in that one you just posted, you call attr? that doesn't make a lot of sense
[15:38:28] <jehoshua02> alright alright, guess I still don't know that it's ajax/append/select then. I'll have to dig deeper. Thanks guys.
[15:38:43] <doug65536> LinuxPhreak: attr with one parameter gets an attribute
[15:43:04] <doug65536> LinuxPhreak: .text() gets text.    .text(str) sets text.    .html() gets html.     .html(str) sets html.    .attr(name) gets attributes      .attr(name,value) sets attributes    .val() gets form values   .val(str) sets form values  etc
[15:45:02] <sayd> is there a way to have .val() trigger a change event?
[15:45:35] <doug65536> sayd: call .change() on the thing that needs the event to happen
[15:50:00] <sayd> doug65536: k.. i would think changing value would do that
[15:51:21] <doug65536> sayd: it won't
[15:52:00] <doug65536> sayd if the user changes it and leaves the field, then you get changed event
[15:54:25] <doug65536> change*
[16:09:34] <sayd> doug65536: yah.. its more with programattic changing of hidden inputs
[16:24:09] <eedfwchris> Is there something more sensitive than "change" for an :input?
[16:24:44] <eedfwchris> The problem I have is a user can type in a field and have the cursor still in that field and hit save and i can't do the onunload prompt for that properly
[16:25:03] <eedfwchris> beforeunload*
[16:26:35] <xyza> hello
[16:26:58] <xyza> im trying to recreate the effect like on this page: http://www.tigihairreborn.com/en-gb/#dry-hair
[16:27:17] <xyza> where if you scroll down a bit, it will auto scroll back to top of that particular div
[16:27:29] <DHowett> eedfwchris: for some reason, I've cargo-culted "input propertychange" into my input change events.
[16:27:48] <xyza> would i use waypoints? or how would i auto scroll it up if the user scrolls down a bit further than the div
[16:28:36] <eddiemonge> eedfwchris: why not blur the field then?
[16:29:11] <duch_kazatel> xyza on scroll, see if the top of the page has passed that point, then scroll them back up if it has.
[16:29:48] <xyza> duch_kazatel : im trying to recreate that effect
[16:29:59] <duch_kazatel> just told you how...
[16:30:03] <duch_kazatel> you then animate.
[16:30:07] <eedfwchris> eddiemonge: ah good idea.
[16:30:35] <xyza> duch_kazatel : would i use scrollTo ?
[16:31:11] <xyza> i could probably use jquery waypoint to check if it has been scrolled passed a point
[16:32:07] <duch_kazatel> no need - you can calculate how far that element is from the top of the window and then go from there.
[16:33:15] <sayd> eedfwchris: let us know what you decide
[16:33:23] <xyza> duch_kazatel: i see
[16:33:56] <duch_kazatel> xyza you'll have to build some logic for detecting scrolls, but it shouldn't be that hard
[16:34:49] <xyza> duch_kazatel: sounds good, thank you
[16:34:56] <eedfwchris> eddiemonge: $(':input').blur(); doesn't seem to work, gives a reference error? should I be doing that some other way? $('input').blur();
[16:34:59] <eedfwchris> works*
[16:36:17] <eddiemonge> eedfwchris: maybe you should be more specific on your target
[16:36:43] <eedfwchris> well it could be any number of types of form fields…
[16:37:14] <eedfwchris> but I'm not so sure that some of them would matter, like <select>
[16:38:01] <eedfwchris> I'll just stick with input and textarea, seems to work well for my form
[16:40:05] <doug65536> eedfwchris: are the in a form?
[16:40:49] <eedfwchris> yes?
[16:41:02] <doug65536> eedfwchris: then try $('form :input')
[16:41:13] <eedfwchris> in all fairness I'm actually doing something like $form.find(':input')
[16:41:53] <doug65536> eedfwchris: is jquery loaded?
[16:42:16] <eedfwchris> yep
[16:42:38] <doug65536> eedfwchris: are you doing it on document ready?
[16:42:53] <eedfwchris> in the console actually "ReferenceError: interval is not defined" is the error
[16:43:25] <eedfwchris> $('form :input').blur();
[16:43:48] <doug65536> try $ in console
[16:44:10] <eedfwchris> $('input').blur(); works fine.
[16:44:20] <doug65536> in console?
[16:44:21] <eedfwchris> ya
[16:45:16] <eedfwchris> Oddly when I do $(':input') it doesn't return a hash of objects like $('input') does
[16:46:30] <doug65536> eedfwchris: http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/qUs6h/
[16:46:53] <doug65536> eedfwchris: and just for you http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/qUs6h/34/
[16:47:42] <eedfwchris> I wonder if the shear number of input is what screws it up?
[16:47:53] <doug65536> eedfwchris: I doubt that
[16:47:55] <doug65536> how many
[16:47:59] <eedfwchris> 125
[16:48:06] <doug65536> I'll test 1000
[16:49:51] <doug65536> eedfwchris: over 1000 http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/qUs6h/36/
[16:51:03] <eedfwchris> Odd
[16:51:17] <doug65536> eedfwchris: 1000+ with values http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/qUs6h/38/
[16:51:48] <doug65536> should I try attaching 1000 blur handlers?
[16:52:55] <digitalmediaguy> So I am submitting this form with a jquery ajaxForm() plugin… I however am still getting a redirect after submitting the form… is there any way to remove the url from the action in the form and still submit a form via ajax?
[16:53:01] <digitalmediaguy> if that makes sense?!
[16:53:11] <doug65536> eedfwchris: all with their own blur handler http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/qUs6h/40/
[16:53:29] <doug65536> eedfwchris: it works in your browser right?
[16:53:55] <doug65536> eedfwchris: some addon could cause weirdness. try the fiddles
[16:54:05] <digitalmediaguy> http://jquery.malsup.com/form/   (that is the ajaxForm plugin)
[16:57:51] <doug65536> eedfwchris: 1000 really different blur handlers
[16:57:52] <doug65536> http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/qUs6h/45/
[16:59:22] <digitalmediaguy> Is there a way to submit a form without a redirect to the action url?
[16:59:32] <digitalmediaguy> with jquery or ajax?
[17:00:39] <alexr2> digitalmediaguy: take a look at jquery-form
[17:01:28] <digitalmediaguy> you mean this? http://malsup.com/jquery/form/
[17:01:36] <digitalmediaguy> ??? that's what I am using
[17:02:17] <alexr2> Yes
[17:02:44] <alexr2> It does ajax form submits
[17:02:49] <alexr2> no need to leave the page
[17:07:26] <doug65536> digitalmediaguy: you don't really need a plugin to do that. submitting a form via ajax is pretty easy. there must be something in the plugin documentation
[17:08:05] <digitalmediaguy> hmmmm… that's what I was hoping for…. and it's working on a test page for me… but in a production scenario it's not working
[17:08:08] <doug65536> chrome is taking a long time to show my fiddle with a million input fields :D
[17:09:02] <alexr2> digitalmediaguy: show some jsfiddle.net

[17:15:03] <doug65536> reloadz: you're asking for 8 to 20 ends of line. probably doesn't work
[17:15:15] <reloadz> what is "g" for?
[17:15:27] <MalfaitRobin> global flag

[17:19:06] <nicky> whatup!!!!
[17:19:41] <digitalmediaguy> Alexr2 thanks… I sent it in a pm
[17:20:23] <MarkyC> Is there any reason why $.parseJSON() might error "unexpected character" even though it's passed valid JSON?
[17:20:31] <MarkyC> (according to JSONLint)
[17:20:48] <digitalmediaguy> in a test window it doesn't actually refresh the page… but when I try to run that code through liveperson it doesn't alert the inital jquery working thing
[17:22:11] <nicky> was wondering if someone may be able to help me with this script and the way it affects the css http://nicinabox.com/superslides/#1
[17:30:08] <nicky> anyone willing to take a look at a jquery script for me
[17:30:28] <nicky> would be much appreciated
[17:31:58] <Technical_13> Jsfiddle?
[17:32:56] <nicky> technical is there a way to upload multiple files to jsfiddle?  Im quite new to it and this script has like 10 files in the package
[17:41:09] <MarkyC> Could anyone shed some light on why $.parseJSON() would fail on the output from this URL: http://whosatschool.com/includes/Ajax/EditBlock.php?day=2&time=510&tableID=1
[17:42:04] <MarkyC> console.log says the output is such from an $.ajax() request: [20:41:15.388] ({id:0, table_id:1, user_id:0, name:"SUCCESS AGAIN!", description:"", location:"", url:"", day:2, start_time:600, end_time:630, exists:false})
[17:42:47] <alexr2> MarkyC: , you're trying to parse JSON from a JSON object
[17:42:58] <alexr2> Can't do that... you can only parse a string to a JSON object
[17:43:31] <alexr2> The response is being sent back as application/json already
[17:43:34] <alexr2> No need to parse it
[17:43:48] <MarkyC> alexr2: So I can just print like obj.name?
[17:43:54] <alexr2> Yep
[17:44:03] <MarkyC> alexr2: Thank you very much
[17:44:08] <alexr2> You're welcome
[17:47:37] <nicky> was wondering if someone could help me with an issue Im having.  Im using a wholepage slider, whenever I try to add an Image (as content, not background),  the image comes out insanlely huge, covering the whole screen.  based on the jsfiddle, anyone able to tell me what file I need to edit on to correct this.  http://jsfiddle.net/nickmtchl/VbWR9/    thanks
[17:51:53] <alexr2> nicky, first thoughts without any functional form of it is that you shouldn't have an image as the description (the container for your first image shouldn't have                         <img src="images/main.png">)
[17:52:09] <alexr2> If you want people to help, at least try to get it partially functional on jsfiddle
[17:52:16] <alexr2> Makes our lives a lot easier
[17:52:28] <duch_kazatel> also: there's no javascript/jquery on that fiddle ;)
[17:53:28] <alexr2> duch, there is, it's just mixed in with the html
[17:53:40] <duch_kazatel> whaaaaa.
[17:53:43] <duch_kazatel> :(
[17:53:47] <alexr2> right!?
[17:54:21] <duch_kazatel> then i still hold my original  point - inline is worse than oelseyhwere.
[17:54:25] <duch_kazatel> *elswhere.
[17:54:28] <alexr2> haha
[17:54:50] <duch_kazatel> 5 linkes doesn't count, either lol.
[17:55:12] <nicky> yea i saw it was at the bottom...i got the script from this github https://github.com/nicinabox/superslides
[17:56:35] <alexr2> nicky, jsfiddle can handle loading all that stuff in so that it's functional.  Take a look at external scripts and get it as functional as possible
[17:56:42] <alexr2> Makes it much easier to solve any other issues you might have
[17:58:08] <duch_kazatel> yeah nicky without it functioning it's hard to see everything that could be impacting it.
[17:58:09] <ernston> hi has anyone here used gmap function with jquery / google maps ?
[18:04:10] <alexr2> ernston: might be easier to just ask your question
[18:09:47] <ernston> am trying to get a fiddle example to make things easier to help
[18:10:09] <ernston> ive come across a different way of using google maps and it has confused me
[18:17:34] <nicky> noooo accidently disconnected
[18:42:45] <nicky> ok so I was able to semi pinpoint what was going on.  it seems I wasnt placing 'page content' the correct place on the html http://jsfiddle.net/nickmtchl/VbWR9/ based on the html/css anyone able to see where each pages content should be places so that it isnt blown up and treated like background as far as sizing
[18:47:20] <BillCriswell> nicky: You can use a service like... http://placehold.it/500/500&text=butts for holder images.
[18:58:00] <doug65536> BillCriswell: hey I can use that too. thanks
[18:58:35] <doug65536> chrome can't handle 1 million form inputs

[19:57:41] <janthony> Does anyone know if the jquery mobile custom builder is broken? I keep trying to do different builds, but loading it into my site is showing a console error.
[19:57:50] <janthony> Looks like other people are having the same issue as well.
[20:04:28] <tieTYT2> I'm trying to get help by putting something on jsfiddle but I can't figure out how to do something with both underscore and jquery.  It seems to have a dropdown that only lets me pick one or the other
[20:08:10] <janthony> I"m getting an error of "Uncaught ReferenceError: define is not defined"
[20:12:30] <tieTYT2> there we go... can someone tell me why this code is alerting the last cell number every time I click on ANY of the cells? http://jsfiddle.net/PaPmE/
[20:12:39] <janthony> This is the offending line in the jquery mobile .js file:  define('depend',[],function () {
[20:17:21] <janthony> I don't get it. I have every checkbox selected on the builder and it does that. If I download the full script not from the builder, there are no errors.
[20:17:35] <janthony> I guess the builder could be buggy atm?
[20:20:03] <tieTYT2> here's my question as a stackoverflow question: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18265279/in-a-loop-im-appending-a-tag-that-alerts-the-loop-index-count-why-does-it-alwa
[20:26:05] <rmurphey> tieTYT2: per the comment there, closures
[20:26:30] <rmurphey> by the time your click handler fires, the value of i is 8
[20:27:44] <tieTYT2> yeah, that's so odd to me.  AFAIK that's not typically how closures work
[20:27:57] <tieTYT2> now I'm off on a quest to figure out how to do what I want
[20:28:51] <ernston> can anyone help me get the json data loading, http://jsfiddle.net/UFpK2/52/
[20:29:04] <rmurphey> that's absolutely how closures work
[20:29:11] <rmurphey> what's confusing you is the coffeescript :)
[20:29:23] <rmurphey> look at the js that's generated and it may become clearer
[20:30:08] <rmurphey> my coffeescript is rusty but something like https://gist.github.com/rmurphey/74123f64f1b1449a35b9
[20:30:14] <rmurphey> but, seriously, learn your js first
[20:30:25] <rmurphey> then use coffee as a tool
[20:30:37] <rmurphey> otherwise it will totally obscure stuff like this from you

[23:36:37] <zapsoda> If not ill have to include jquery just for that one line :p
[23:36:38] <OnkelTem> http://learn.jquery.com/ - this stupid thing is opened instead
[23:36:42] <doug65536> zapsoda: .checked I think
[23:37:38] <zapsoda> OnkelTem, do you mean this? http://api.jquery.com/
[23:37:40] <OnkelTem> I was searching for jQuery.data() methond ref, but found only this: http://learn.jquery.com/using-jquery-core/data-methods/ - silly tutorial

[23:40:11] <Cork> jacta: or possibly $().eq(0).nextAll('img').wrapAll('<div class="Thumbs"></div>');
[23:40:25] <jacta> Cork: thanks :)
[23:42:32] <OnkelTem> In jQuery UI in

[23:43:30] <OnkelTem> So jQuery.data() is called with 3 arguments, but API states it has only 2 parameters
[23:44:01] <Cork> OnkelTem: the third is internal only if i remember correctly
[23:44:11] <Cork> ah no
[23:44:17] <Cork> OnkelTem: you think about $().data
[23:44:20] <Cork> this is $.data()
[23:44:38] <Cork> $.data() is $.data(elm, key, value)
[23:44:42] <OnkelTem> ahhhh ))
[23:44:56] <Cork> while $().data() is $(elm).data(key, value)

[23:45:32] <doug65536> finfin82: I think I have a solution
[23:46:45] <OnkelTem> Cork: refering the code I copy-pasted - what does the last argument "new object( options, this )" mean?
[23:47:04] <OnkelTem> Just wondering, as options is 'undefined' here in my case
[23:47:11] <finfin82> doug65536: ??
[23:47:35] <Cork> OnkelTem: object would have to be a function somewhere (Object would be another matter)
[23:50:21] <OnkelTem> Cork: that's it. What a weird decision on the function name
[23:51:02] <OnkelTem> or rather - variable name
