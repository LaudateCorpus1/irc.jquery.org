[02:23:29] <MACscr> am i doning something wrong here? https://jsfiddle.net/6n0ye5vu/1/. Is there something wrong with setting the custom_element variable that way?
[02:24:25] <Cork> MACscr: yes
[02:24:51] <Cork> what happens there is: 1. custom_element sets to '<input>'
[02:25:22] <Cork> 2. $(custom_element) parses the string into a dom element HtmlElementInput
[02:25:39] <Cork> 3. .attr sets type to element_type
[02:25:54] <Cork> 4. the return value isn't saved so the dom element is garbage
[02:26:14] <Cork> 5. $(custom_element) parses '<input>' into a dom element HtmlElementInput
[02:26:24] <Cork> 6. .attr sets name to element_name
[02:26:38] <Cork> 7. return value isn't saved to the dom element is thrown away
[02:26:48] <Cork> (repeat again)
[02:27:24] <MACscr> https://jsfiddle.net/6n0ye5vu/2/
[02:27:25] <Cork> ??. el.append($(custom_element)) parses the string '<input>' to a dom element HtmlElementInput and appends it to the element el
[02:27:30] <MACscr> so this?
[02:27:39] <Cork> not really
[02:27:50] <Cork> firstly why are you creating all these variables?
[02:27:53] <MACscr> seems to work
[02:28:05] <MACscr> because all those values are set in a form
[02:28:24] <MACscr> so im dynamically generating the input
[02:28:35] <MACscr> and obivousyl dont want to add the attribute if its not set in the generator
[02:28:54] <Cork> MACscr: https://jsfiddle.net/6n0ye5vu/3/
[02:29:00] <Cork> that will do the same thing
[02:29:10] <Cork> and much less messy code
[02:29:18] <Cork> also the check for value != '' isn't needed
[02:29:27] <Cork> cause if you don't create value it will be ''
[02:29:33] <Cork> so it would be identical
[02:29:53] <MACscr> wouldn it be placeholder='' if i was setting that attribute?
[02:30:02] <Cork> no
[02:30:13] <Cork> placeholder is if the value is blank and '' == blank
[02:31:02] <Cork> MACscr: https://jsfiddle.net/ckpxof2L/
[02:34:05] <MACscr> im confused, thats just html. I meant that i dont want to set a placeholder attribute if im dynamically setting it with something like https://jsfiddle.net/L9jxsrca/
[02:34:13] <MACscr> obviously not functional, but you get the oint
[02:34:26] <MACscr> point
[02:34:26] <MACscr> im using a form to create a form input =P
[02:34:38] <MACscr> aka, to generate a form
[02:34:38] <Cork> MACscr: your code didn't set placeholder
[02:34:42] <Cork> it created value
[02:35:07] <MACscr> those are just examples, im setting up about 6 or so possible attributes
[02:35:22] <Cork> MACscr: and all other attributes are fine
[02:35:41] <Cork> and honestly placeholder='' would also be the same as placeholder not being set
[02:35:42] <MACscr> thus im doing a if statement so its only set if it is set in the generator
[02:35:48] <Cork> as both would result in nothing shown
[02:35:51] <MACscr> thats just an example....
[02:36:05] <MACscr> i dont want to set id="" or class=""
[02:36:11] <Cork> MACscr: you seam to not understand that not defined attributes are always ""
[02:36:21] <Cork> so sjkdfhklsjdfhjklsdhf="" by default
[02:36:52] <Cork> if you want to exclude a specific value like "missing" or something sure
[02:37:06] <MACscr> im making something that generates html code that actually goes into static files
[02:37:11] <Cork> but "" is the same as not doing anything so why have the extra logic clottering things up?
[02:37:12] <MACscr> idont want crappy html markup
[02:38:13] <pavonia> Cork: What is the value of the "checked" attribute then if set?
[02:38:48] <Cork> pavonia: depends "" or checked depending on html version
[02:39:04] <Cork> pavonia: but for checked what you want to care about isn't attribute but the property
[02:39:12] <Cork> as that is what holds the state of the element
[02:40:17] <Cork> you have <input checked> (notice the missing ="something")
[02:40:32] <Cork> and there it became empty but the property held true
[02:40:55] <Cork> since xhtml the standard is to set that as checked="checked" for the attribute
[02:41:26] <pavonia> What is the difference between attribute and property here?
[02:41:35] <MACscr> this is my nasty code so far, but works http://jsfiddle.net/w0tLy4rd/82/
[02:41:50] <MACscr> you can click on "Add Custom" to see how it works
[02:41:59] <Cork> pavonia: attribute is the string value set on an html tag, properties is the value of the dom element
[02:42:07] <Cork> attribute is ALWAYS a string
[02:42:19] <Cork> properties is dependent of what the key defines
[02:42:34] <Cork> so property checked is true/false
[02:42:41] <Cork> while attribute is checked or ""
[02:42:58] <pavonia> Oh, thanks
[02:43:23] <Cork> pavonia: for a more direct code example it is the difference between elm.<key> and elm.getAttribute('key')
[02:43:56] <Cork> the biggest difference is for places where the browser modifies the value, like href for example
[02:44:38] <Cork> <a href="#top"> attribute is "#top", property is "http://www.example.com/path/to/file.html#top"
[03:45:10] <KnightsOfNi> Is it better to do $('.element') or $(document).find('.element') - performance wise?
[03:56:25] <MACscr> https://jsfiddle.net/rewqyLw2/3/, any ideas how i can better get the #wrapper to only do the height of what the remaining viewable area is?
[04:04:23] <Cork> KnightsOfNi: they are identical
[04:04:41] <KnightsOfNi> k
[04:04:56] <Cork> when you do $('.element') what jquery does internally is exactly $(document).find('.element')
[04:05:25] <Cork> so if you want to be extramly picky $(document).find() is a T-I-N-Y bit faster as it doesn't have to go through the forwarding code
[04:05:36] <Cork> but you won't ever notice it cause it isn't much code
[04:08:24] <Cork> KnightsOfNi: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/core/init.js#L98
[04:12:28] <KnightsOfNi> so it isn't all that bad to select a random element deep within the dom directly?
[04:18:48] <pavonia> Depends on the selector, "#elem" is cheap, "foo bar .elem" isn't
[04:49:00] <pejot> hi all
[04:50:29] <pejot> i have var data_rezerwacji = event.start.split(' ')[1];
[04:51:31] <pejot> but event.start its date from db but js think 'start' its function
[04:53:08] <pejot> how can i tell jquery start its event part not function?
[04:53:47] <Cork> KnightsOfNi: id and class selectors are very cheap, the longer the selector is the more costly it becomes
[04:54:12] <Cork> KnightsOfNi: :<something> selectors is even more costly and [] is also among the most costly
[04:54:22] <Cork> KnightsOfNi: where the element is it self has less to do with it
[04:55:03] <Cork> pejot: how do you get the event.start object?
[04:55:22] <Cork> cause for example json can't send functions so...
[04:56:12] <Cork> KnightsOfNi: oh, and also you want #id elm elm elm is quite cheap but elm elm elm #id is not
[04:56:20] <Cork> - you want
[04:56:24] <pejot> Cork, its json
[04:56:28] <KnightsOfNi> oh ic
[04:56:30] <KnightsOfNi> thanks!
[04:57:02] <Cork> browsers love selecting children but not parents :)
[04:57:12] <Cork> pejot: then it can't be a function...
[04:57:22] <KnightsOfNi> like in an orphanage
[04:57:26] <pejot> event.start  = '2017-01-01 20:00:00'
[04:57:36] <pejot> i need split this
[04:57:52] <DelphiWorld> hey peoples
[04:57:53] <DelphiWorld> ;)
[04:58:17] <DelphiWorld> i want to feed html in a div, multiple line paragraph. but i am putting every single line in a <p> tag
[04:58:30] <Cork> pejot: event = { start: '2017-01-01 20:00:00' }; event.start.split(' ')[1] == '20:00:00'
[04:58:34] <DelphiWorld> i dont see it apropriate for a screen reader, because the screen reader always see a empty line bethwan them
[04:58:44] <DelphiWorld> have any other way?
[04:58:57] <Cork> DelphiWorld: could you create a jsfiddle?
[04:59:15] <Cork> DelphiWorld: cause p shouldn't indicate lines
[04:59:22] <DelphiWorld> cork, again sadly jsfeedle isn't good for screen reader :-P
[04:59:30] <DelphiWorld> Cork, will give the url
[04:59:44] <DelphiWorld> Cork: http://www.islamzone.pro
[04:59:47] <Cork> DelphiWorld: ya, but we aren't talking about screen readers here we talk about marking lines with <p>
[04:59:51] <pejot> Cork, Uncaught TypeError: event.start.split is not a function
[04:59:58] <DelphiWorld> actualy there's no jquery code yet, its static using jquery mobile
[05:00:16] <Cork> pejot: then .start !=  '2017-01-01 20:00:00'
[05:00:28] <Cork> console.log(pevent.start) gives you?
[05:01:05] <pejot> 2017-05-08 16:00:00
[05:01:12] <DelphiWorld> bethwan every <p> tag i can see a emptyline, (Heare) rather ;)
[05:01:24] <Cork> pejot: console.log(typeof(event.start))
[05:01:56] <Cork> DelphiWorld: ya, cause you don't have lines you have paragraphs
[05:02:11] <Cork> they are suppose to be complete text sections
[05:02:18] <DelphiWorld> Cork: what's the way to indicate lines so
[05:02:23] <pejot> Cork, object
[05:02:31] <Cork> i would recommend using <p>text<br>more text<br></p>
[05:02:50] <Cork> and split when a paragraph is over instead
[05:03:04] <DelphiWorld> so <br> is to put a new line?
[05:03:04] <Cork> if you want a separate element per line use a span or div
[05:03:06] <Cork> yes
[05:03:17] <DelphiWorld> Cork: hold on...
[05:03:25] <Cork> the last br was a typo by me though
[05:03:52] <Cork> pejot: console.log(event.start.constructor.name) ?
[05:04:09] <DelphiWorld> Cork: so: <p>this is line one
[05:04:10] <DelphiWorld> <br>
[05:04:30] <DelphiWorld> Cork: <p>this is line1
[05:04:30] <DelphiWorld> <br>
[05:04:30] <DelphiWorld> this is line2</p>
[05:04:31] <DelphiWorld> right?
[05:04:33] <pejot> Cork, r
[05:04:39] <Cork> DelphiWorld: no
[05:04:48] <Cork> pejot: r??
[05:05:43] <pejot> Cork,
[05:05:46] <pejot> Cork, yes
[05:06:42] <Cork> DelphiWorld: https://jsfiddle.net/nqgrq4yy/
[05:06:48] <pejot> Cork, i need go to work. I will back ;)
[05:06:49] <Cork> just some throw-together
[05:07:11] <Cork> pejot: so what ever you pass this through from when it was json to you have i...
[05:07:14] <Cork> oook
[05:07:28] * Cork suspect we have another person mistaking objects for json...)
[05:09:04] <DelphiWorld> clear now, Cork
[05:09:05] <DelphiWorld> thx!
[05:09:19] <Cork> np
[05:09:38] <DelphiWorld> jquery mobile is truely aria code...
[05:10:03] <Cork> i've always stayed far away from that thing
[05:10:17] <Cork> i don't like the coding style or structure at all
[05:10:27] <DelphiWorld> Cork: lol what's your way so
[05:10:43] <Cork> DelphiWorld: jquery (optional) and straight html normally
[05:10:56] <Cork> adding toolbars and things like that isn't that hard now days
[05:11:10] <DelphiWorld> Cork: but jqm would help me as a blind because at least it ofer default mobile styling
[05:11:45] <Cork> DelphiWorld: if you structure the html correctly
[05:11:55] <Cork> it will be very accessable by default
[05:12:04] <DelphiWorld> not only accessiblity but visual look
[05:12:06] <Cork> styling for small screen can be done through css
[05:12:18] <Cork> (and i do those)
[05:12:48] <DelphiWorld> Cork: because you're sighted, you can get up easyly with css;)
[05:13:18] <Cork> DelphiWorld: not sure what you mean, its just text
[05:14:18] <Cork> @media screen (min-width: 800px) {} and so on
[05:14:25] <DelphiWorld> Cork: how its looking now? is it good?
[05:15:23] <Cork> not much difference from before >_> (not i normally don't load all resources when i check ppls sites from here)
[05:15:30] <Cork> *note*
[05:15:38] <DelphiWorld> ;)
[05:15:45] <DelphiWorld> no images at all only html at this time
[05:15:55] <Cork> yup, like the first time i loaded it :)
[05:16:08] <Cork> all i wanted was the paragraph structures so...
[05:16:50] <DelphiWorld> :P
[05:17:49] <Cork> if ppl don't want to provide a none js fallback its there choice, (and is one of my big problems with jquery-mobile)
[05:29:25] <printForever> what's the difference? https://pastebin.com/d2W4efRm
[05:30:02] <Cork> printForever: a line break
[05:30:17] <printForever> well... some say it isn't so
[05:30:35] <printForever> "The JavaScript masters know the difference" #facepalm
[05:30:46] <printForever> so I came here to ask...
[05:31:03] <Cork> printForever: https://jsfiddle.net/3op6eefx/
[05:31:15] <Cork> javascripts allow lines to end without;
[05:31:26] <Cork> so a runs return; and then well nothing
[05:31:28] <printForever> Cork: https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/142086/why-the-recent-shift-to-removing-omitting-semicolons-from-javascript
[05:31:31] <Cork> so the return value is undefined
[05:31:47] <printForever> In the first example, the return is considered a solitary statement and the line-end is the equivalent of a semicolon. The second example actually returns the object.
[05:32:00] <printForever> #confusedAF
[05:32:07] <Cork> ya
[05:32:14] <Cork> cause { doesn't cause a line end
[05:32:22] <Cork> it is a starting block
[05:32:34] <Cork> so it won't cause a ; until the parser sees ;
[05:32:38] <Cork> same with ()
[05:33:05] <Cork> printForever: so https://jsfiddle.net/3op6eefx/1/
[05:33:25] <printForever> ok
[05:34:03] <Cork> (well and same with [] or if the next line starts with .)
[05:34:08] <printForever> Cork: sorry, I'm not sure I follow
[05:34:22] <printForever> They said something different
[05:34:37] <printForever> "return is considered a solitary statement"
[05:34:57] <Cork> ya, they are simplifying things quite a bit
[05:35:06] <Cork> it isn't specifically a return thing
[05:35:21] <Cork> it is a basic behavior from the js parser
[05:35:39] <printForever> so is there a wrong/right here?
[05:35:57] <Cork> printForever: what they are saying is correct, in that specific case
[05:36:04] <Cork> but you would have to specify a long list of cases
[05:36:20] <Cork> what i said was the cause of the "truth" in there statement
[05:36:39] <Cork> and is what cases these things to happen anywhere the parser looks at js code
[08:17:06] <codecutter> Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'removeClass' of undefined https://jsfiddle.net/aepu6dvt/6/
[08:17:24] <codecutter> i get this after adding the 'treemap-color.js' lib
[08:21:48] <codecutter> i think this may have something to with the treemap-color.js lib
[08:34:11] <Deusdeorum> I have someArray1 and someArray2 then I have a rand variable someRand that rand(1,2). Can I build someArray1 and someArray2 without a if statement? and if so, how?
[08:34:24] <Deusdeorum> Is it possible to merge someArray + someRand ?
[08:41:45] <Deusdeorum> For my question above, line 25: how can i build someArray1 or someArray2 based on my varutyp_js: https://pastebin.com/3dAragVE
[08:53:55] <Deusdeorum> this will explain question above a little bit better: https://repl.it/HmIA/2
[09:41:35] <Cork> Deusdeorum: yes you can
[09:42:25] <Cork> Deusdeorum: var someValues = { 1: [1,2,3], 2: [3,2,1] }; someValues[Math.floor(Math.random() * 2) + 1];
[09:43:14] <Deusdeorum> hmm, how does that work Cork? Where is the picking of either 1 or 2?
[09:43:29] <Cork> [Math.floor(Math.random() * 2) + 1] <--
[09:43:41] <Cork> someValues is an object with two arrays (1 and 2)
[09:43:53] <Cork> and the number from the Math.floor() + 1 is the key
[09:44:45] <Deusdeorum> Ah, nice1!
[09:45:34] <Deusdeorum> I used a simple if statement but that feels really dumb because it is the same code so rather have a dynamic variable
[09:46:20] <Cork> Deusdeorum: you might want to define that object statically if you don't change the values all the time
[09:46:29] <Cork> would create a little less gc if you call it a lot
[09:47:03] <Deusdeorum> true! thanks for your input
[09:47:18] <Cork> np
[09:47:56] <Cork> oh, btw by statically i meant not inside the function your doing the call in
[09:49:20] <Deusdeorum> hm, so outside and then just call the function of the randomness? no?
[09:49:52] <MikeD_> i have no idea of the context, but i like the phrase  "call the function of the randomness"
[09:50:00] <Deusdeorum> :(
[09:50:23] <Deusdeorum> thought it was a clever sentence :D
[09:50:45] <MikeD_> yeah, i'm going to try to use it in scrum
[09:50:51] <Cork> Deusdeorum: yes
[09:51:20] <Cork> if you want to isolate it you can do (function() { var <local variables> window.randomness= function() {}; })();
[09:51:54] <Cork> Deusdeorum: but it really depends on how often you can this it might just not be worth it at all
[09:52:14] <Cork> (premature optimizations and all that)
[09:52:20] <Deusdeorum> Nah, it is not worth it at the moment, but really nice to know for a non-JS'er like me. (usually python)
[09:53:23] <Cork> uh... you can this? >_<' *you call this*
[11:14:41] <Kalinox> Hello, is anyone here?
[11:33:34] <Kalinox> Anyone here? :)
[11:34:06] <pavonia> If you have a question, just ask ...
[12:40:25] <robertmaxrees> gooooooooood morning
[12:48:08] <Kalinox> Robert :D
[12:48:15] <Kalinox> Hi ^^
[12:48:34] <Kalinox> I'm trying to add this Youmax plugin to my website :)
[12:49:27] <Kalinox> Although nothing is showing up though.. x:
[12:49:49] <robertmaxrees> any console errors?
[12:51:33] <Kalinox> Yeh.. Accueil.html:736 Uncaught TypeError: jQuery(...).youmax is not a function     at HTMLDocument.<anonymous> (Accueil.html:736)     at j (jquery-2.1.4.js:2)     at Object.fireWith [as resolveWith] (jquery-2.1.4.js:2)     at Function.ready (jquery-2.1.4.js:2)     at HTMLDocument.I (jquery-2.1.4.js:2) ﻿  ​
[12:51:48] <robertmaxrees> sooo what does that suggest to you?
[12:51:58] <Kalinox> That I'm using 2.1.4 instead of the right version?
[12:52:04] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[12:52:12] <robertmaxrees> "jQuery(...).youmax is not a function"
[12:52:21] <robertmaxrees> that usually means you're trying to use something before it exists.
[12:52:33] <Kalinox> So, just need to do var youmax; ?
[12:52:37] <robertmaxrees> no.
[12:52:47] <robertmaxrees> you need to make sure your code comes after you include youmax before your code.
[12:52:57] <Kalinox> Ohhhh
[12:53:03] <robertmaxrees> make sense?
[12:53:03] <Kalinox> So that means it has to go to the top not the bottom :)
[12:53:17] <robertmaxrees> or your code needs to go after the youmax code.
[12:53:26] <robertmaxrees> you can move your js there.
[12:54:01] <Kalinox> Yeh ^^ Now I'm getting new errors o:
[12:54:08] <robertmaxrees> and they are?
[12:54:31] <Kalinox> jquery-3.1.0.min.js:2 jQuery.Deferred exception: jQuery(...).youmax is not a function TypeError: jQuery(...).youmax is not a function     at HTMLDocument.<anonymous> (https://kalinox-pacophp.c9users.io/Portfolio/Accueil.html:65:20)     at j (https://kalinox-pacophp.c9users.io/Portfolio/js/jquery-3.1.0.min.js:2:29568)     at k (https://kalinox-pacophp.c9users.io/Portfolio/js/jquery-3.1.0.min.js:2:29882) undefined r.Deferred.exceptionH
[12:54:36] <Kalinox> Same one, and a new one o.o
[12:54:56] <robertmaxrees> you're including jquery twice on the page.
[12:55:01] <robertmaxrees> need to remove one.
[12:55:56] <Kalinox> woww its starting to work :)
[12:56:03] <Kalinox> Almost there, just 2 new errors
[12:56:05] <robertmaxrees> you remove a copy of jquery?
[12:56:20] <Kalinox> Yes.
[12:56:28] <Kalinox> Now I only get these errors
[12:56:29] <Kalinox>  jquery-3.1.0.min.js:4 GET https://www.googleapis.com/youtube/v3/channels?part=contentDetails%2Csnippet&id=UCmwZGeV1WnE7dPlHhf8DFiQ&key=AIzaSyBDanbIXegNcgdW82gzfc434YYcjUsGYmE 403 ()
[12:56:46] <Kalinox> So I'm guessing I have to open an API from google to let it flow onto my website?
[12:57:00] <robertmaxrees> "The request did not specify any referer. Please ensure that the client is sending referer or use the API Console to remove the referer restrictions."
[12:57:34] <Kalinox> Eh xD? Where are you getting this?
[12:57:56] <robertmaxrees> see the URL after that GET ?
[12:58:13] <robertmaxrees> are you loading this locally or via a server of some kind?
[12:58:22] <Kalinox> server
[12:58:34] <Kalinox> Trying to get my youtube channel to work on my website :)
[12:58:39] <robertmaxrees> dunno then.
[12:58:51] <Kalinox> Ohh.. o: okay :3
[12:59:00] <Kalinox> I'll figure it out ^^ You've been of great help robert.
[12:59:16] <robertmaxrees> i'd search around The Google® and see what you can find.,
[12:59:47] <Kalinox> Yah :) Thanks for the heads up. How do you find my website? Its getting better ^^
[12:59:58] <Kalinox> Its responsive for all plateforms now :)
[13:00:10] <Kalinox> Except when I landscape it on my iphone >_>
[13:00:21] <robertmaxrees> have you linked it?
[13:00:41] <Kalinox> https://kalinox-pacophp.c9users.io/Portfolio/Accueil.html
[13:01:13] <Kalinox> It changes from one navbar I plugged in onto a new navbar I plugged in once the width closes in o.o
[13:01:43] <Kalinox> I worked really hard on that new navbar. Took me a whole day just to figure out how the icons worked.
[13:01:59] <Kalinox> It basicly loaded 5 icon images from 1 SVG file.. Which kind of got me confused.
[13:02:14] <robertmaxrees> you know taht mobile nav icon isn't working, yeah?
[13:02:33] <Kalinox> Mobile nav icon o.o?
[13:02:39] <Kalinox> It should.. Unless..
[13:03:03] <Kalinox> Uhg, mustve been when I deleted that jquery 2.1.4
[13:03:15] <robertmaxrees> for starters: https://i.imgur.com/yl995XQ.png
[13:03:47] <robertmaxrees> TypeError: $(...).offset(...) is undefined - getting this in FF when i narrow downt he browser and then click.
[13:04:07] <Kalinox> sec
[13:04:28] <robertmaxrees> $("a").on('click', function(event) { is your issue.
[13:04:38] <robertmaxrees> you likely don't want smooth scrolling for that menu, do you?
[13:06:44] <Kalinox> I want smooth scrolling for that menu.
[13:06:50] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[13:06:55] <robertmaxrees> shouldn't that icon open the menu?
[13:07:02] <Kalinox> Yeh, refresh the page
[13:07:10] <Kalinox> Now I have that other jquery problem we just fixed again xD
[13:07:30] <robertmaxrees> that's not smooth scrolling.
[13:07:38] <robertmaxrees> heh
[13:07:54] <robertmaxrees> dunno why we keep going in circles with this.
[13:08:00] <robertmaxrees> you need to load one version.
[13:08:13] <Kalinox> XD ..  2.1.4 or 3.1.0 =/
[13:08:22] <Kalinox> I think one activates one plugin and the other one activates the other.
[13:08:54] <robertmaxrees> what plugin is giving you that functionality?
[13:08:58] <Kalinox> When I get rid of 2.1.4 my mobile navbar wont work anymore o.o
[13:09:02] <robertmaxrees> becauise it really just looks like you're loading ytour js all wrong.
[13:09:17] <Kalinox> Hmm
[13:09:23] <Kalinox> Want my c9 password XD?
[13:09:41] <robertmaxrees> no
[13:09:48] <robertmaxrees> you need to learn to do this the right way.
[13:09:54] <Kalinox> True.. x.x
[13:10:03] <Kalinox> You're so thoughtful and patient :3
[13:10:13] <Kalinox> I hate taking so much time off of you.
[13:10:16] <robertmaxrees> stretchy?
[13:10:57] <robertmaxrees> do this:
[13:11:01] <robertmaxrees> take <script src="js/jquery-2.1.4.js"></script>
[13:11:09] <robertmaxrees> delete it from where it is right now.
[13:11:18] <robertmaxrees> and then replace <script src="js/jquery/jquery-3.1.0.min.js"></script> with it.
[13:12:44] <Kalinox> But that'll make my mobile navbar stop working I think.
[13:13:00] <robertmaxrees> you're still going to uise 2.1.4
[13:13:04] <robertmaxrees> you're getting rid of the other one.,
[13:13:04] <Kalinox> Okay.
[13:13:09] <robertmaxrees> and moving 2.1.4
[13:13:41] <Kalinox> Where is 2.1.4 going to go?
[13:13:48] <robertmaxrees> where the 3.1.0 ref was.
[13:14:01] <robertmaxrees> you're moving 2.x and replacing 3.x with it.
[13:14:09] <Kalinox>           <script src="js/jquery-2.1.4.js"></script> <script src="js/jquery-3.1.0.min.js"></script>
[13:14:12] <Kalinox> So delete 3.1.0 ?
[13:14:14] <robertmaxrees> yes
[13:14:21] <robertmaxrees> you're replacing it with 2.x
[13:14:32] <Kalinox> kk done
[13:14:35] <robertmaxrees> and now?
[13:14:45] <Kalinox> Mobile navbar won't work.
[13:15:05] <Kalinox> Should I put the JQuery at the bottom of the html page?
[13:15:16] <Kalinox> Or in the head?
[13:15:26] <robertmaxrees> it shjould come before anything trying to use it.
[13:15:50] <robertmaxrees> you need to modify your smooth scroll code to ignore .cd-nav-trigger
[13:16:32] <Kalinox> So that the mobile navbar works?
[13:16:55] <robertmaxrees> that should help fix that problem.
[13:17:05] <robertmaxrees> any time you're getting an error, all kinds of things can break.
[13:17:19] <Kalinox> I see. Let me check the scrolling code.
[13:17:41] <robertmaxrees> there's a quick fix to it.
[13:18:10] <robertmaxrees> just check if $(hash) has a length before trying to use it,.
[13:19:14] <Kalinox> I don't see $(hash) in my js o.o
[13:19:40] <Kalinox>       // The optional number (800) specifies the number of milliseconds it takes to scroll to the specified area       $('html, body').animate({         scrollTop: $(hash).offset().top       }, 800, function(){
[13:19:52] <robertmaxrees> you really don't see it in what you just pasted?
[13:20:02] <Kalinox> Yeh, I found it afterwards in the html.
[13:20:14] <robertmaxrees> right.  in a script tag.
[13:20:19] <Kalinox> Yup.
[13:20:35] <Kalinox> I thought <script> was an element? So they're called tags.
[13:20:53] <Kalinox> (We learned code in French _-_ )
[13:20:57] <robertmaxrees> or elements.
[13:21:02] <Kalinox> Alright. :)
[13:21:04] <robertmaxrees> the script tag/element contains JS.
[13:21:11] <Kalinox> Yeh, that I'm aware.
[13:21:17] <taplar_> they are elements when they are parsed into the dom
[13:21:18] <robertmaxrees> 'kay.
[13:21:25] <Kalinox> Taplar is back O:
[13:21:35] <taplar_> with soup
[13:21:40] <Kalinox> Even better!
[13:22:53] <Kalinox> So.. Is the $(hash) mesured by length?
[13:23:12] <robertmaxrees> yoou want to see if that actually selected anything.
[13:23:23] <robertmaxrees> otherwise .offset() returns nothing.
[13:23:44] <Kalinox> <script> $(document).ready(function(){   // Add smooth scrolling to all links   $("a").on('click', function(event) {      // Make sure this.hash has a value before overriding default behavior     if (this.hash !== "") {       // Prevent default anchor click behavior       event.preventDefault();        // Store hash       var hash = this.hash;        // Using jQuery's animate() method to add smooth page scroll       // The optional n
[13:23:50] <robertmaxrees> yooooo
[13:23:53] <robertmaxrees> that's super hard to read.
[13:24:00] <robertmaxrees> use a paste service or something.,
[13:24:11] <Kalinox> Right.
[13:24:27] <Kalinox> https://jsfiddle.net/84xqb5az/
[13:25:07] <robertmaxrees> soooo what did you change?
[13:25:20] <Kalinox> I didn't change anything I'm just analysing it for now o.o
[13:25:25] <robertmaxrees> okay
[13:27:07] <Kalinox> So why do I have to check if $(hash) has a length in order to be able to use it?
[13:27:22] <robertmaxrees> look at your console when you click the mobile nav icon.
[13:27:28] <robertmaxrees> what happens?
[13:28:52] <Kalinox> So you're saying I should give that icon an href # maybe o.o?
[13:28:59] <Kalinox> Because it's looking for something.
[13:29:02] <Kalinox> That isn't there really.
[13:29:15] <robertmaxrees> i never said that.
[13:29:27] <robertmaxrees> i suggested what you should do - a few times now.
[13:29:39] <Kalinox> Ahh yes. It has a #0 in the href
[13:29:42] <Kalinox> So it can't find it.
[13:30:13] <Kalinox> Yayyy it's working now :)
[13:30:20] <robertmaxrees> what'd you wind up doing?>
[13:30:30] <Kalinox> Deleting the #0 from the href o.o
[13:30:43] <robertmaxrees> lol that's one way to do it i guess.
[13:30:47] <Kalinox> Because basicly that scroll was trying to detect where it was going but couldn't because there was no id="" with 0
[13:31:09] <Kalinox> href="#0" = id="0"
[13:31:14] <robertmaxrees> right.
[13:31:41] <Kalinox> So now everything is working ^^ except for the Google API thing :)
[13:31:57] <Kalinox> Thanks a lot robert, you da best. :) Not to mention Taplar with his soup ^^
[13:33:28] <Kalinox> Hey robert, you make websites for a living?
[13:33:43] <robertmaxrees> i work as a frontend developer, yeah.
[13:33:56] <robertmaxrees> i don't usuallyt roll out new sites.
[13:34:15] <Kalinox> Yeh, you just modify what they give you I suppose? o.o
[13:34:27] <robertmaxrees> sort of?
[13:34:35] <Kalinox> Aye. o.o
[13:34:38] <robertmaxrees> i build new features, fix bugs, that kind of stuiff.
[13:34:51] <Kalinox> That's awesome. :)
[13:35:16] <Kalinox> I'll be like you someday ^^
[13:35:32] <robertmaxrees> hah, you don't want to be ;)
[13:36:14] <Kalinox> Cuzz with great knowledge comes great responsibilities?
[13:38:05] <robertmaxrees> more like... this job isn't what most people make it out to me.
[13:38:48] <robertmaxrees> *to be
[13:40:13] <Kalinox> Hmm o.o
[13:40:38] <Kalinox> Well, maybe someday I'll make a cool game and you'll be able to help me fix console errors :3
[13:40:46] <robertmaxrees> hah
[13:40:46] <Kalinox> And we'll get rich ^-^ Mwahah
[13:41:05] <robertmaxrees> nah.  i've already got that project in the works.
[13:41:17] <Kalinox> Ooooo O:
[13:41:23] <Kalinox> Are you using an engine?
[13:41:31] <robertmaxrees> it's not a game.
[13:42:07] <Kalinox> Oh. What is it about o.o?
[13:42:34] <robertmaxrees> a way to track inventory for wine and beer that you're aging.
[13:43:24] <robertmaxrees> with plans to add in analysis with some light prediction so you can know when to open that special bottle you've been saving.
[13:43:55] <activeindex> Hi everyone. I'm trying to debug a browser specific issue related to bootstrap and I have no idea how. It's a real estate website and the slider doesn't work properly in Firefox or Safari. It works fine in Chrome though.. It actually DOES work in Firefox if you let the site sit for a bit and click through the images very slowly. In Chrome you can c
[13:43:55] <activeindex> lick through as fast as you want.
[13:44:27] <robertmaxrees> activeindex have you profiled the site to see if it's a perf issue?
[13:45:12] <activeindex> I have not. What does profiling the site mean?
[13:45:33] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Performance
[13:45:41] <robertmaxrees> part of the build-in dev tools for your browser.
[13:46:47] <activeindex> I'll watch the video and check. Thanks!
[13:53:39] <activeindex> It doesn't seem to be performance related I don't believe
[13:53:57] <activeindex> It doesn't look like any computations are taking a long time or anything
[13:54:31] <activeindex> and when I check out the call tree, I don't even see the script that is being referenced in the error in the console
[13:55:13] <robertmaxrees> and the page is interactive while you wait?
[13:55:23] <robertmaxrees> can you share the page out to the room?>
[13:55:28] <activeindex> https://www.iheartplacer.com/homes-for-sale-details/21357-MASON-ROAD-COLFAX-CA-95713/17026343/6
[13:57:18] <robertmaxrees> i.data(...).getActiveIndex concerns me a little but that shouldn';t cause the issue you're seeing now.
[13:58:23] <activeindex> Unfortunately that portion of code isn't editable by me either-- it comes from their real estate IDX feed (bundle.js)
[13:58:39] <activeindex> so in the event that I needed to replace that, I would be screwed :-\
[13:58:43] <codecutter> level 2 font-size is ignored (see line 284)? https://jsfiddle.net/aepu6dvt/7/
[13:59:16] <robertmaxrees> activeindex humm... i'm lost.
[13:59:31] <robertmaxrees> maybe taplar_ has an idea?
[13:59:35] <activeindex> robertmaxrees as far as a solution you mean?
[13:59:38] <activeindex> shucks :(
[13:59:49] <robertmaxrees> codecutter did you have a questrion?
[13:59:58] <activeindex> robertmaxrees try refreshing the page and then wait 15 seconds or so before clicking on the next picture
[14:00:07] <activeindex> and that activeindex error won't show up
[14:01:20] <codecutter> bruh!
[14:01:30] <codecutter> do you not see a question mark?
[14:01:34] <codecutter> :)
[14:02:14] <robertmaxrees> codecutter oh, you have a question for highcharts.
[14:02:49] <robertmaxrees> activeindex one of the images never loads.
[14:03:05] <robertmaxrees> activeindex are you adding custom markup for that carousel?
[14:03:06] <codecutter> maybe someone here can help me out. #highcharts never responds
[14:03:19] <robertmaxrees> lol
[14:03:25] <activeindex> robertmaxrees nope, it's stock plugin configuration from their local IDX
[14:03:45] <robertmaxrees> activeindex any way you could fix that image that never loads?
[14:04:37] <activeindex> which image never loads for you?
[14:05:06] <robertmaxrees> if i click left or right two times i get to a slide with no image
[14:05:17] <activeindex> for me, in Firefox, the first image loads but when I hit next twice
[14:05:22] <activeindex> yeah that's the issue
[14:05:29] <activeindex> if you try loading it in Chrome that doesn't happen
[14:05:31] <robertmaxrees> that seems liek a bad image to me.
[14:06:05] <activeindex> i was thinking maybe it has to do with i.data being used somewhere else?
[14:06:20] <activeindex> the images load fine in other browsers and for me, in FF, when you sit and let the site load for 15 seconds or so
[14:06:21] <robertmaxrees> how do you configure this carouself?
[14:06:32] <activeindex> then slowly click images with a few seconds between clicks
[14:06:39] <activeindex> the images will load in FF and the slider works
[14:07:00] <activeindex> robertmaxrees I literally do nothing, the properties, property details, images, etc. are all generated by the plugin
[14:07:10] <activeindex> all I had to do was put in their license key
[14:07:22] <robertmaxrees> is this some kind of paid-for solution?
[14:08:08] <robertmaxrees> here's where I'
[14:08:23] <activeindex> yeah. it didn't use to work in Chrome either but they said oh, add this JS snippet and it will fix it
[14:08:31] <activeindex> and it did fix it for me in Chrome, but not other browsers
[14:08:53] <robertmaxrees> *i'm headed: it seems like all you do is configure stuff.  you didn't write any code for this.  since you're paying for this, you should go back and tell 'em you need a fix for other browsers.
[14:09:22] <activeindex> https://thepasteb.in/p/Anhr4yoK5gDUv
[14:09:22] <activeindex> yeah the problem is they are blaming it on WordPress theme
[14:09:32] <activeindex> that is the snippet they had me add which fixed it in chrome ^^
[14:09:35] <activeindex> ^^^
[14:10:06] <robertmaxrees> hummmm
[14:10:12] <robertmaxrees> are you able to edit the wordporess theme?
[14:10:53] <activeindex> yes
[14:11:19] <robertmaxrees> and have you checked to make sure you're only running 1 copy of jquery?
[14:12:13] <tariqali> Er, hey, is anyone here? I want to ask a philosophical question about jQuery
[14:12:22] <robertmaxrees> tariqali lots of people are.
[14:12:23] <robertmaxrees> what'
[14:12:27] <robertmaxrees> *What's your q? :)
[14:12:54] <tariqali> Ah. I like jQuery. It’s a great tool. However, there’s been a lot of chatter about why jQuery is unnecessary because you can write most functions using vanilla JS.
[14:13:08] <robertmaxrees> *in browsers that support them, yes.
[14:13:18] <tariqali> But I like using jQuery. I think it’s a great tool. But how do I argue against those that argue against using jQuery?
[14:13:28] <tariqali> Is it even possible to argue against them? Is jQuery about to be obsolete?
[14:13:29] <robertmaxrees> why argue?
[14:13:31] <activeindex> robertmaxrees there were initially 2 bootstrap.min.js files being loaded
[14:13:38] <activeindex> one by the theme, 1 by the real estate plugin
[14:13:43] <robertmaxrees> activeindex that'll cause some problems.
[14:13:53] <robertmaxrees> tariqali you're jumping ahead :)
[14:14:07] <activeindex> when i tried pulling it out of the theme it broke a bunch of stuff
[14:14:15] <activeindex> i think that might still have soemthing to do with it though
[14:14:24] <robertmaxrees> what about copies of jquery activeindex?
[14:14:30] <tariqali> Well, the reason why I think that arguing matters is because by people posting stuff online, they can create an echo chamber that can affect what developers do
[14:14:53] <tariqali> If someone on Hacker News post that Foo Framework is awesome, and then more people agree, then there will be a lot of people using Foo Framework…regardless of whether it’s good or not.
[14:15:01] <robertmaxrees> tariqali some people are going to believe what they want to believe regardless
[14:15:28] <robertmaxrees> it's salient to point out though that the problems jquery solves still exist.  using native js doesn't fix them.
[14:15:42] <robertmaxrees> if you want to use native JS and want to support older browsers, for instance, you get to use babel + a polyfille.
[14:15:47] <robertmaxrees> *polyfill
[14:16:03] <tariqali> …and Babel takes your pretty JS code and make it pretty much ugly JS.
[14:16:13] <robertmaxrees> which doesn't really matter fwiw.
[14:16:22] <robertmaxrees> the output js isn't intended to be human-readable.
[14:16:34] <robertmaxrees> you also lose the extensive plugins that are available.
[14:16:43] <robertmaxrees> there's a reason lots of frameworks use it (or their own spin on it).
[14:16:56] <robertmaxrees> jQuery isn't right for every project, though.
[14:17:23] <activeindex> robertmaxrees as far as I can see, jquery is only enqueued once
[14:17:41] <tariqali> robertmaxrees: That’s defintently true.
[14:17:50] <activeindex> I just tried removing the themes main js file but now a bunch of other scripts aren't loading properly to test to see if that's the problem
[14:17:59] <activeindex> i.e. magnificPopup is not a function
[14:18:08] <activeindex> which is weird because there is still bootstrap.min.js being loaded?
[14:18:14] <activeindex> isnt magnific popup part of bootstrap?
[14:18:24] <tariqali> I guess the reason I ask is that I used jQuery for a very small project
[14:18:33] <robertmaxrees> activeindex nope.
[14:18:40] <robertmaxrees> activeindex standalone jquery plugin
[14:18:45] <tariqali> and I was worried that a few years later, some programmer who is maintaining the app is going to be upset at me for using jQuery
[14:18:54] <activeindex> hmm alright
[14:18:59] <tariqali> But I guess they’d be angry at me regardless of what JS library/framework I use.
[14:19:04] <activeindex> let me try enqueueing that script
[14:19:17] <robertmaxrees> tariqali you're worrying about the wrong things :)
[14:20:20] <robertmaxrees> tariqali you should focus much more on issues like "writing readable code".
[14:20:41] <tariqali> Fair enough.
[14:20:51] <tariqali> I guess I should do some refactoring.
[14:20:57] <tariqali> Well, I already am, but more refactoring is always good.
[14:21:19] <robertmaxrees> hah
[14:24:11] <blitz206> Does anyone know how I can rotate an item not on axis?
[14:24:24] <blitz206> Specifically, a line.
[14:25:40] <activeindex> robertmaxrees -- it's working now
[14:25:46] <activeindex> after removing the default theme js
[14:26:12] <activeindex> lots of stuff not working now-- i.e. the navigation
[14:26:18] <activeindex> but at least i narrowed down the root of the problem
[14:27:30] <activeindex> Thank you for your help-- I appreciate it!
[14:28:59] <robertmaxrees> yeah definitely!
[14:29:05] <robertmaxrees> glad i could help.
[14:53:13] <codecutter> any suggestions?
[14:54:12] <codecutter> this highcharts lib is doing my head in. i can't be bothered to learning it as it is a one off task.
[14:54:24] <codecutter> learn*
[15:00:48] <robertmaxrees> i'd peruse the docs and search around on google.
[15:39:28] <Kalinox> Robert
[15:41:52] <robertmaxrees> over 450 people in hjere ;)
[15:42:10] <robertmaxrees> just ask your question.  if somebody can help, they will.
[15:59:56] <Kalinox> This website says you can use multiple versions of JQuery at once using this method, is this true? http://blog.nemikor.com/2009/10/03/using-multiple-versions-of-jquery/
[16:16:12] <sopparus> hello, how can I get the value of <input class='form-control' type='text' name='lame'>
[16:16:24] <sopparus> i want the name value
[16:19:12] <robertmaxrees> Kalinox it's possible, but that's really not intended as a long-term strategy.
[16:19:24] <robertmaxrees> sopparus .prop('name')
[16:21:36] <sopparus> ehm, sorry. I meant the value of that form box where name='lame'
[16:24:16] <Kalinox> in Javascript or PHP?
[16:26:10] <sopparus> javascript
[16:26:35] <sopparus> well eventually to php but ill manage that :)
[16:31:29] <robertmaxrees> sopparus are you ajaxing it over?
[16:31:42] <robertmaxrees> either way, you're looking for an attribute selector.
[16:31:59] <robertmaxrees> though I might give that element a class and select that instead.
[16:38:40] <Kalinox> Robert
[16:38:45] <Kalinox> I managed to fix the plugin :)
[16:38:56] <Kalinox> The only problem now is that it dosen't play the videos o.o..
[16:39:02] <Kalinox> And there's no console error.. hmm
[16:40:07] <Kalinox> I found an error.
[16:40:10] <Kalinox> jquery.min.js:3 Mixed Content: The page at 'https://preview.c9users.io/pacophp/kalinox/Portfolio/Accueil.html?_c9_id=livepreview1&_c9_host=https://ide.c9.io#projets' was loaded over HTTPS, but requested an insecure resource 'http://www.youtube.com/embed/F9XxTIntqrM?&rel=0&autoplay=0'. This request has been blocked; the content must be served over HTTPS.
[16:40:26] <Kalinox> So I'm guessing I have to get rid of jquery.min.js
[16:46:41] <robertmaxrees> Kalinox "i managed to fix the plugin" - did you edit the plugin source?
[16:47:24] <Kalinox> I don't think so.
[16:47:31] <robertmaxrees> and that last error has literally nothjing to do with what copy of jquery you're uysing.
[16:49:12] <Kalinox> Yeh I did edit the plugin source when I think about it.
[16:50:01] <Kalinox> Needed to add the API/ Channel and Playlist links to them.
[16:50:05] <Kalinox> Could one of the links be wrong?
[16:50:06] <Kalinox> 		channelLink:"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmwZGeV1WnE7dPlHhf8DFiQ", 		playlistLink:"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9XxTIntqrM&list=UUmwZGeV1WnE7dPlHhf8DFiQ", 		apiKey:"AIzaSyBEYEkH0v10UjxSbOiwEQekSnKbEhGNP9k",
[16:51:07] <robertmaxrees> Kalinox you need to not edit the plugin source.
[16:51:10] <robertmaxrees> that';s  a bad idea.
[16:51:20] <robertmaxrees> and the error is pretty clear.
[16:53:25] <Kalinox> But edit it to what..
[16:53:26] <Kalinox>         <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.2.1/jquery.min.js"></script>  ...
[16:53:43] <Kalinox> Do I have to downgrade it?
[16:53:45] <robertmaxrees> you're not reading the erro rmessage.
[16:54:08] <robertmaxrees> reread it.
[16:54:51] <robertmaxrees> lemme strip it down:
[16:54:51] <robertmaxrees> The page at 'https://<SITEURL>' was loaded over HTTPS, but requested an insecure resource 'http://<YOUTUBEURL>>'. This request has been blocked; the content must be served over HTTPS.
[16:56:20] <robertmaxrees> Kalinox what does that error mean to you?
[16:57:45] <Kalinox> One of them is http instead of https?
[16:57:55] <robertmaxrees> lol
[16:58:07] <robertmaxrees> it means you're trying to load youtube via http, but the page you're on is https
[16:58:10] <robertmaxrees> which is a no-no
[16:58:23] <Kalinox> So.. What should I do?
[16:58:32] <robertmaxrees> link to the plugin?
[16:58:44] <Kalinox>         <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.2.1/jquery.min.js"></script>  ?
[16:58:48] <Kalinox> Oh sec.

[17:00:39] <robertmaxrees> don't m,ake me sift through 700+ lines of code.
[17:00:51] <robertmaxrees> just the relevant bits for this plugin please.
[17:01:49] <Kalinox> kk
[17:02:14] <Kalinox> The demo version?

[17:04:48] <Kalinox> Yup
[17:05:03] <Kalinox> I'm just not sure about the channel playlist links though
[17:05:15] <Kalinox> But the API I know is good.
[17:06:08] <robertmaxrees> *sigh* http://demos.codehandling.com/youmax/ -> https://i.imgur.com/8AyKerw.png
[17:06:12] <robertmaxrees> the plugin is bad.
[17:06:18] <Kalinox> Uhg u.u
[17:06:21] <Kalinox> How come?
[17:06:42] <Kalinox> Uhg.... =/
[17:06:52] <Kalinox> It was all good looking on my website xD
[17:06:52] <robertmaxrees> i thought you were under the gun for this site?
[17:07:02] <Kalinox> What is this new expression?
[17:07:23] <robertmaxrees> you were saying that you were behind schedule and under a tight deadline.
[17:07:43] <Kalinox> Yeh I am.
[17:07:46] <Kalinox> Its due for Friday.
[17:07:53] <Kalinox> But I have like 3 exams in betwene.
[17:07:55] <Kalinox> between*
[17:08:12] <robertmaxrees> do you really need to implement a youtube channel thing for it?>
[17:08:26] <Kalinox> Well, would be the idea.
[17:08:31] <Kalinox> Instead of using <video>
[17:09:06] <Kalinox> I could just upload my videos on there and have them instantly loaded onto the website.
[17:10:38] <robertmaxrees> are videos a requirement?
[17:12:29] <Kalinox> Yeh.. I wrote it in my task file..
[17:12:42] <Kalinox> "Video Gallery:
[17:12:47] <Kalinox> "Video Gallery"*
[17:16:40] <Kalinox> What are your thoughts?
[17:32:10] <robertmaxrees> Kalinox i mean, i'd just use the youtube API and go that route.
[17:32:22] <robertmaxrees> but something tells me that's a bit of a tall order ;)
[17:38:39] <Kalinox> I put a new plugin in there. https://preview.c9users.io/pacophp/kalinox/Portfolio/Accueil.html?_c9_id=livepreview1&_c9_host=https://ide.c9.io#videos
[17:38:44] <Kalinox> Oops sec
[17:39:09] <Kalinox> https://kalinox-pacophp.c9users.io/Portfolio/Accueil.html#videos
[17:39:19] <Kalinox> But everytime I click on a video I get sent to the start of the page.
[17:41:16] <robertmaxrees> why do you think that is?
[17:43:38] <Kalinox> I thought to myself that you could use a # at the end of a url link so that it would send the user to the precise location when onclicking.. But adding #videos at the end of the link isn't doing anything. My guess is that there's a code that sends the user back to the beginning of the page.
[17:43:44] <Kalinox> After going to #video
[17:43:56] <robertmaxrees> not exactly.
[17:44:06] <robertmaxrees> it only happens after you click a video, righjt?
[17:46:08] <Kalinox> Yes.
[17:46:21] <Kalinox> I found this bit of text from the creators of the plugin.
[17:46:23] <Kalinox> "The anchor text inside each link is also optional, and has no effect on the rendering of each thumbnail."
[17:46:33] <robertmaxrees> that has nothbing to do with your issue fwiw.
[17:47:00] <robertmaxrees> http://dynamicdrive.com/dynamicindex17/youtube-video-gallery.htm is this the plugin?
[17:47:29] <Kalinox> This is
[17:47:30] <Kalinox> http://jquery-plugins.net/youtube-gallery-wall
[17:47:52] <robertmaxrees> which links to the page i just pasted ;)
[17:48:46] <robertmaxrees> height: 100%; - why do you have this set on HTML?
[17:49:24] <Kalinox> I think it was meant for the body xD
[17:49:56] <robertmaxrees> it's applied to html, body
[17:50:20] <Kalinox> Okayz.
[17:50:35] <Kalinox> But yeh.. Anchor
[17:50:46] <robertmaxrees> again
[17:50:51] <robertmaxrees> anchors aren't the issue here.
[17:50:55] <robertmaxrees> that css property is.
[17:51:11] <robertmaxrees> remove the html part of that selector and watch it work correctly.
[17:52:55] <Kalinox> Ohh.. You're good.
[17:53:02] <Kalinox> I would've never guessed that one.
[17:54:04] <robertmaxrees> it's because that pluign sets overflow-x: hidden; on html.
[17:55:11] <Kalinox> Hm o.o
[17:55:38] <robertmaxrees> easy enough to figure out ;)
[19:40:22] <chatter29> hey guys

[21:12:40] <enfinitee> Hello friends. Quick question for a website I'm working on. I'm a complete newbie to this, using MaterializeCSS. I'm trying to make a function that, when I click a button, will create a div with content from a form. I found some examples that aren't working. Any help would be appreciated!
[21:27:36] <Kalinox> I'm having trouble with some animations.. My <p> Element starts with an opacity of 0 and goes to 1 with an ease.. From Right to left by 100px. Thing is, it starts outside of the body. The position is absolute but then my body is wider than what it should be and we see the outside of it because of it. xD Anyone have a solution for this?
[21:59:35] <Kalinox> Anyone here?
[22:07:49] * D-rex raises hand
[22:08:17] <Kalinox> D-rex, can you help me solve this issue?

[22:08:59] <Kalinox> I'm guessing the function inside the <script></script> elements is well positioned? Or perhaps its because I'm using 2 JQueries at once?
[22:09:21] <Kalinox> isn't well positioned*
[22:09:34] <D-rex> Why are you using 2?
[22:09:44] <Kalinox> I'm not sure if I am using 2. Am I ? xD
[22:09:45] <D-rex> What do you mean by that>?
[22:10:24] <Kalinox> Well, it dosen't detect its a function... So my guess is.. the elements need to be shot elsewhere in the html?
[22:11:28] <D-rex> make a pastebin or similar of code
